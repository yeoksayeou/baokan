<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕民社黨中常委胡海門，廿三日下午一時自京飛返北平，記者趨訪胡於私邸，據談：民社黨參加國大事，民社黨總部殆已完全決定，余携北方一部份黨員意見，赴滬轉京會晤張君勱時，蔣主席長二頁之覆文已到，在此種情勢下，一切頗有無可更易之勢。余返平前，君勱先生甚望北方同志能諒解其所決定，並聲明渠個人並不參加國大。記者詢以民社黨是否將因此分裂，胡未作答。胡今返平下機後，首先與　秋水等交　意見，日內並將與張東蓀會晤。北方一部份黨員是否將　國大事再度表示能度，或有所行動。須俟　張等會商後再行決定。</p>

<h3 id="c2">張君勱致主席函 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕民社黨由張君觔具名致主席之函件，及主席覆函，於廿三日正式交換，晚九時由民社黨徐傅霖宣佈，該函內容茲照錄如次：</p>
<p>張君勱函：</p>
<p>介公主席勛鑒：自今歲一月參加政協以來，所系念不忘者，厥爲和平統一，將國內各黨融合於國大之中，制定全國共守之憲法，我公之所祈求者，諒不外乎此，孰料事與顧遠，國共之始合於政協者，終以國大召開日期未獲協議而睽離。君勱曾力主延開十五日以寬商談之限，亦未能得各方之共諒，至令希求和平之人心惴惴焉，羣疑國共之和談無日，停戰令雖下人民仍恐難逃戰禍之苦，國大雖能召開，而所制定之憲法，恐將難邀共守，政協代表亦將剖而爲二，此種疑竇，如果演成事實，則國家將萬刦不復，然君勱竊以爲局勢雖危，尚不無挽回之望，厥在鈞座善爲運籌，而先盡其在我者：（一）如何澈底執行停戰命令，以防戰事之擴大，面示誠心爭取和平之至意：（二）如何澈底實現政協決議之精神，，以昭示實行民主之決心於國人。</p>
<p>澈底實行停戰命令者：</p>
<p>第一，三人會議所主持之軍事調處執行部，應繼續積極工作，力免衝突之擴大，預留恢復和談之餘地。</p>
<p>第二，依照整軍方案，政府應以最大之忍讓，求其實現。</p>
<p>第三，政府迭次聲明，以政治方式解決政治糾紛之主張，應堅定不變，庶幾達到眞正和平，財政得以整理，國力得以鞏固。</p>
<p>澈底實現政協決議者：</p>
<p>第一，政協憲草審議會所修改之憲草，應在國大之內，各方應負責使其通過。</p>
<p>第二，切實保護人民身體言論結社講學之自由，令人民能暢發其心中之抑鬱，政府亦因此知民心之向背，而有所鋻戒。</p>
<p>第三，政府旣決心實行憲政，應自動早日結束黨治，以下數端，宜先實行：</p>
<p>（一）自憲法頒布後，各級黨部經費停止由國庫開支。</p>
<p>（二）政府改組後，中央旣有國府委員會爲決策機關，其省市縣行政，自應由省市縣政府負責，地方黨部不得干涉。</p>
<p>（三）學校爲養成國民與人才之地，倘令，靑年學生參加黨團政治工作，徒滋紛爭，政府應本爲國育才之道，明定辦法，消除黨化敎育之嫌。</p>
<p>凡此各端，倘政府能切實施行，自能引起人民瞭然於趨向民主之決心，而造成國內和祥之氣，殊有助於和談之恢復。</p>
<p>第四，改組政府，各黨合作，旨在刷新政治，應本用人惟賢之宗旨，一新天下之耳目。自政協以來，似乎各黨爭執爲國府席數與政院部務之担任，然實質上，所急需者，爲行政全部精神之刷新與人才之不分界限，倘國民黨籍之人對於改組後之政府或多方控制，或相互牽掣，則行政機構將益形瓦解，而無法運用。君勱對於憲草旣已隨政協之後參加於事先，自願完成審議工作，倘憲草能一本政協之決議，而同時政府能迎之於機先，早日自動表示結束黨治，一面澈底執行停戰命令，一面澈底實現政協決議之精神，則民主社會黨同人，雖深以各黨不克共聚一堂爲缺憾，然在此還政於民之日，自當出席以贊大法之完成。國中不乏懷疑於此項將成之憲法實際執行之成效者，然君勱不敢加以臆測，而置身審議之外。今後建國大業之成敗，固緊於此，即全國人心之向背，亦視憲法執行成效如何而定矣，諸維亮詧，竚候明敎。中國民主社會黨組織委員會主席張君勱謹啓。三十五年，十一月，二十日。</p>
<h3 id="c3">陳立夫暢論　制憲與和談 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕組織部陳部長立夫，廿三日接見記者，暢談制憲問題，認五權制度最適合我國情。論及和談問題，認爲時機一到，重開仍屬可能，然共黨徘徊於和談，則惟徒苦人民而已。</p>
<h3 id="c4">主席覆張君勱函 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>蔣總裁復函：</p>
<p>君勱先生大鑒：</p>
<p>接讀十一月二十日大函，承示數事，悉爲政府今日之所蔪求，具見先生謀國之忠，不勝感佩，此次召開國大，旨在完成國父畢生奮鬥目的，與實現政府結束訓政還政於民之夙願，此爲國人所共曉。允必爲先生所贊助。頃悉貴黨擬即參加，至爲欣慰，函中指示各點，或爲政府所已辦，或爲政府方在實施，要皆真知灼見，與政府不謀而合。中共問題政府始終抱定以政治方法覓取解決途徑。此次停戰命令必須澈底執行，執行小組應繼續有效，而整軍方案爲達到軍隊國家化之目的，允應期其實現。政協憲草旣經協議，各方應負責設法使其通過，保護人民自由政府已前後頒布實施辦法，今後自應一一求其實行。</p>
<p>至於來書所言結束黨治諸事，本黨早有決議，並已逐步實施，自當於憲法頒布後，準如來函所云，早日完成。</p>
<p>關於改組政府，於政治問題必須集中各方人才與提高行政效率，使建國工作得以迅速推進。總之，函中列舉諸端，俱爲政府所當爲，亦即中正個人所願竭其全力以求其實現者。先生平素主張早日實施憲政，此次召開國民大會，即在制定憲法，俾本黨結束黨治，還政於民，亦正先生之所蔪求。故此國民大會，甚盼貴黨人士出席，共同參加制憲工作，俾憲政早日實施，則先生所有政治與主張，一切皆可迎刃而解，務希貴黨與各黨人士，及社會賢達，一本抗戰初起時精誠團結共赴國難之精神，與本黨通力合作，以促進建國大業之完成，國家前途實利賴之！專此佈復，即頌勛祺！中國國民黨總裁蔣中正。三十五年，十一月，二十一日。（究）</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京廿三日電〕今晨自可靠方面獲悉：延安共產黨中央委員會，在一星期內將決定共產黨是否接受政府之和平方案，抑或退入中國西部小區進行長期戰爭。同時，馬歇爾將軍祖任中國調人之未來命運，亦在延安手中，衆料在未來數日中，延安將發表一聲明，闡明美總統之特使對於共產黨是否仍可接受。苟共產黨中央委員會希望如此，衆信馬歇爾將軍與司徒雷登大使願意飛赴延安，以謀獲致和平解決。同時，共產黨和談首席代表局恩來，正向共產黨中央委員會報告南京談判經過，決定共產黨是否保持彼等最近所取之强硬態度，以致拒絕蔣主席之停戰建議抑或彼等願意獲致隨手可得之和平。某高級政府方面人士今日告合衆社記者云：如共產黨亦能發出停戰令，再行召開三人委員會，以決定軍隊防區之永久分配　則內戰『幾可立即』結束。如共產黨不接受和平建議，則政府將認共產黨之態度爲公開反叛政府也。渠稱：蔣主席之態度似已大爲緩和，因在憲草修正案方面以及改組政府方面，恪守一月聞各黨各派會議所定之原則，但共產黨竟拒絕退讓一步，並謂：共產黨此種能度，可能僅爲一種政治姿態，惟在國民大會中以及即將改組之國府委員會與行政院均爲共產黨保留位置，虎席以待，則爲事實。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>訂正稿與原草案主要不同點之一，爲原草案對人民之權利義務，其規定爲一人民有××之自由，非依法律不得限制之。」而訂正稿改爲「人民有××之自由，」而將其下之「非依法律不得限制之」取消。此係根據政協原則所修改者。（政協關於人民權利義務會作如下之規定：（一）凡民主人民應享之自由及顧利，均應受憲法之保障，不受非法之侵犯；（二）關於人民之自由，如有法律規定，須出之於保障自由之精神，非以限制爲目的。）</p>
<p>訂正稿起草人王憲惠，本月十三日列席立法院，說明整理經過時，曾謂：訂正稿與原草案目的相同，僅出發點相異。各委員對此咸相當滿意，並認爲一種進步之規定。陳顧遠氏認五五憲草之規定過於瑣碎，對人民信仰自由，應吾列入憲法，亦提出疑問，蓋各國憲法對此並無規定。渠認訂正稿所列舉之自由爲天賦人權，然亦非全無限制，如二十三條規定：「凡人民之其他自由及權利，不妨害社會秩序公共利益者，均受憲法之保護」，予人民以積極性之保障。鍾天心亦認訂正稿較原草案爲優。</p>
<p>唯一認該條不如原草案者爲傅統先，傅氏爲一邏輯學家，曾以無黨無派色彩於立法　談話會時發表其獨特之見解。傳氏以爲：原憲草並無「法律限制」之意味，第一句：「人民有××之自由」，係積極性者，其對象爲人民，憲法根據此句予人民以自由之保障，第二句「非依法律不得限制之，」係消極性者，其對象爲政府，憲法根據此句拘束政府。此種規定，實較訂正稿爲優。</p>
<p>傅氏根據邏輯作進一步之解釋稱：「非依法不得限制之」，並不等於「依法律得限制之」。並舉例稱：「假使不依法律就不得限制」，可改成「假使這花沒有顏色一定不是紅的。」此兩語在邏輯上同犯「換質法」否定主詞之錯誤。一般認原五五憲法爲法律限制者，其錯誤即在於此。同時，「非依　不得限制之」中所指之法律　若與保障人民權利之憲法原則相違反，此一法律即不能限制人民之自由，易言之：政府即限制人民之自由，亦須在憲法範圍之內，故似可無庸置慮。然則根據合乎憲法之法律，能否限制個人自由？傳氏認爲憲法既爲人民代表所制定，即人民本身所制定，自可限制人民之自由</p>
<p>國大的組織與職權</p>
<p>關於國大的組織與職權，訂正稿與五五憲草有極顯著之不同點，由於此種不同，國大與立法院間之關係亦大相差異。根據五五憲草，國大代表由縣市及蒙古西藏及僑胞直接普選。而訂正稿則增加二項：（一）由各省區·西藏·蒙古及縣直接選出之立法委員，（二）由各省議會及蒙古各盟西藏地方議會選出之監察委員。</p>
<p>陳長蘅氏認加上一二兩款後、國大代表之總額可能增爲四千人左右。人數旣增加，開會時將較困難。</p>
<p>其次：陳氏認爲根據訂正案，國大代表每六年改選一次，監察委員雖亦爲六年一次，然其選舉，不與國大代表同時。立法委員之任期僅爲三年，易言之，即在一次國大期間內，須選舉兩次出任國大代表之立法委員。此外，總統與立委，監委亦非同時選舉者。又根據條款，先有立委監委之產生，而後有國大，其改選自須在國大改選之前。由於選舉期之先後，種種弊端即隨之而生，院與院間，總統與立法院間亦易起磨擦。</p>
<p>關於國大代表增加立委監委一點，王寵惠氏於立院報告憲草整理經過時會謂，如是可增加兩院對國大聯繫。李慶襄氏亦認此爲訂正稿之優點，蓋國大若是駐會委會之規定（廿三年憲草初稿曾規定於國民大會閉幕時期，設一國民委會，五五憲草將此一規定删去訂正稿亦同。）則易與立法院發生衝突，與監察院亦有疊牀架屋之弊。李氏認立法委員出任國民大會代表後，立法院在若干方面即等於國大之駐委會，在國大休會期間，可由對法律較有研究，且經常在首都之立委，根據一般法律趨勢與當前政治情况，監督政府並制定法律。且可於必要時請求召開國大臨時會議。凡此種種，皆爲訂正稿進步之處。傅統先　國大閉幕後，如何表達人民意志一點，亦提出相似之意見。</p>
<p>根據五五憲草，監委與立委原皆由國大選舉，而根據訂正稿，　委由各省市議會選舉，立委由人民直接選出，產生方法有變更，鍾天心認此種變更不能謂其减輕立委　委之獨立性，反可謂其獨立性有增加‘　陳顧遠氏亦認由人民直接間接選出之立委監委爲國大代表後，較原憲草爲直接。</p>
<p>關於國大職權，根據原憲草，國大有六種職權，即選舉總統，副總統，立法院正副院長，監察院正副院長，立委及監委之權，罷免正副總統，正副立法，司法，考試，監察院長及立委之職，創制及複決法律權，修改憲法權，及憲法所賦予之其他職權。而根據訂正案。國大之權限僅限於選舉罷免正副總統，創議修改憲法及複決立法院所提之憲法修正案。（而對創制複決又有限制）不論對人對法，其職權皆遠較五五憲草爲小，多數委員咸主予以增加。</p>
<p>對人方面，陳長蘅認除正副總統外，其他重要官員亦應由國大選舉。對法方面，傅統先等認國大應有創制及複決法律之權。渠認國大旣爲民意機關，對憲法以外之其他法律，自可創制原則，交付立法院制成法律。傅氏與李慶　咸認領土關係國家主權殊鉅，其更動富不能僅由法律規定爲已足，而應由國大變更之，然亦有認國大職權若增加恐將侵及治權而表反對者，陳顧遠氏即爲其代表。</p>

<p>自聯合國大會由蘇聯代表提出國際裁軍問題以後，莫洛托夫外長又於一昨在聯合國大會政治委員會席上重新提出國外駐軍問題。依照蘇聯方面的意見，外國軍隊駐在非敵國境內，乃干涉該國內政之方法，因而認爲盟軍不應駐在盟國。莫洛托夫繼復提出建議，由聯合國大會請安全理事會轉請各會員國於一個月內提出下列報告：（一）會員國在何處非敵國領土內駐有幾許軍隊；（二）會員國在何處前敵國境內，駐有幾許軍隊；會員國前此及最近建立之基地及海軍防地設在何處。莫氏續稱：「波蘭境內尚有少數蘇軍，乃用以維持對德交通錢者，至於朝鮮北部之蘇軍，則係根據與盟邦所訂協定而駐在。反視英美軍隊，於戰爭久已結束後，仍駐在歐亞及南美各處，其空軍基地且更密佈世界各處，而若干國家對於兩極允感特別興趣。蘇政府於八月間即向安理會提出軍隊駐在非敵國內之報告，蘇聯願意履行此項義務，希望他國亦能同意以謀世界共同之利益。</p>
<p>此一問題之提出，引起美國代表康納利的憤激，且更進一步聲稱：「調查駐軍，應包括世界全部之軍隊，携有剌刀之兵士，不論其在本國土地，抑或外國土地，均足搆成對和平之威脅。」英國代表見此情勢，於是不得不提出折衷方案，認爲蘇聯代表所提出之建議，僅以駐在國外之武裝軍隊爲限，實嫌不足，主張設立一參謀委員會，俾搜集對於此項問題所有一切情報。此一建議究竟將如何發展，尚有待於以後的事實證明；不過此一國外駐軍問題之再被提出，而蘇聯代表的口吻，字裏行間，於沈着之中，充分表露了反英美的情緒，以致激動了美國代表的情感，發爲犀利之詞，是則此一問題之提出，無寗說又是蘇美鬥爭的一、種露骨表現。莫洛托夫甚至明白指出美軍駐在中國毫無理由可言。這使我們想起月前烏克蘭代表在聯大席上所提出的要求美軍撤離中國的提議，後先呼應，至堪玩味。</p>
<p>這一國外駐軍問題旣牽涉到中國，我國自不容緘默。出席聯合國大會的我國代表顧維鈞氏乃於一昨席上有所指陳，除贊同美國的修正案，即對於駐軍的調查，應該沒有國內外之分，聯合國機構會員國均應公布其國內外軍隊之人數外，並嚴詞吾認美軍在華已「引起摩擦」。我們除贊同我國代表的聲明外，更願對國外駐軍問題，略申我們的所見。</p>
<p>第一，我們贊同蘇聯代表的建議，認爲各國駐在外國之軍隊，應該加以調查，並有交換情報的必要；但我們認爲國外駐軍不應與國內駐軍分離，而應該一併調查。蓋駐軍雖有國內外之分，但一國武裝力量則係整個的；撇開了國內駐軍不談，不能使國外駐軍有明確的認識。足以威脅世界和平的，不僅是國外駐軍，而是一國軍備的總和。所以我們認爲國外駐軍固應調查，國內駐軍亦應調查，俾一國軍備的總和力量得以有明確的認識，是否足以威脅世界的和平。</p>
<p>第二，我們反對駐外軍隊千涉駐在國的內政；但我們必須明白駐外軍隊在性質上的差別。戰敗國家之有占領軍的統治，當然不能說是駐外軍隊的千涉內政。第二，目下旣然還是一個以國家主權爲中心的世界，則一個國家之邀請另一國家的軍隊駐在其境內，爲一個國家主權之正常行使。凡此行爲，祇要雙方出於自動的意志，不足構成一種足以引起國際討論的課題，除非此項行爲確有威脅世界和平的時候。如果一國的軍隊沒有得到駐在國的同意或邀請而逕自派遣，是其行爲，實無異於侵略，自然應爲愛好和平的民族所不容。因而對於盟軍不應駐在盟國這一種一般的指陳，我們認爲必須附帶有條件。否則即無異限制一個國家主權的正當行使。</p>
<p>第三，關於國內外駐軍，其關鍵不僅在調查，而是在調查後之是否裁减。因此，駐軍的調查問題，實是裁軍問題的一部。因此，我們贊同英外相貝文的表示：「調查國外駐軍與裁减軍備，實爲一事」應會同討論」。若僅言國外駐軍的調查，而不談國內駐軍的調查，這沒有抓住問題的整個；若僅言國內外駐軍的調查，而不談軍備的裁减，又沒有抓住問題的整個。所以國外駐軍與裁减軍備，實爲一事，不可分開。</p>
<p>講到美軍駐華，係得我國政府之同意，且並未干涉中國內政；是爲中國主權之正當自由行使，本不應被視爲一種問題而提付國際討論。况美軍駐華人數極少，亦不足以威脅世界和平。目今蘇軍雖已撤離我東北若千主要城市，然蘇軍在東北的實際情形究如何，世人多未明悉。且其撤離，又往往不循正當途徑交由我國政府接管，是則以蘇聯而提出國外駐軍問題，也實在不免令人有啼笑皆非之感。我們願國際間能够少有一些摩擦，纔能够有國際間的衷誠合作；必如此，世界和平纔能持久。</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖廿二日電〕莫洛托夫今日在聯大會之政治委會中致辭，反對英代表團主張將調查國外駐軍案與裁軍案同時討論之議。渠再度表示蘇聯願意供給其國內軍隊之情報，惟稱此一問題應與裁軍問題有關。渠指出國外駐軍本身爲一重大問題，而普遍裁軍則爲一更重大之事。若將兩事相提並論，不免顧此忽彼。調查國外駐軍案雖米有拒絕者？但有從事規避之企圖，須知任何規避的答覆，實有損而無益，希望各曾員能一致支持此案，强國應視該事爲其責任，而小國亦可因此獲得保證。</p>
<p>法代表巴洛狄聲言將贊助蘇聯之建議，惟覺該事不能與裁軍案同時討論，指出不可將蘇聯建議中之具體部份，葬沒在更廣大之裁軍間題內。英代表培克聞言，即起立聲明，謂英代表團並無掩沒蘇聯建議中任何部份之意，僅願使兩事同時討論，渠認法代表之頁，實等於贊助英國之建議。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫發言達五十分鐘之久，渠特別指出英軍駐在希臘之事，謂在和平時期，强國駐大軍於小國境內，當然能引起心理上之不安。駐軍問題直接影響各國之利益安全獨立與自由，故具有應予討論之充分理由。今戰爭雖已結束，環境亦有變更，但駐軍問題仍爲重大問題。駐軍在其他聯合國會員國內實無理由可言。若駐軍國自認有理，即應提川解釋，今軍事上之需要已經消失，駐軍外國已引起世界輿論之極度不安。前此在安理會中曾因蘇軍之駐在伊朗而引起許多爭論，然當時蘇政府曾宣布其延遲退出伊朗之原因，蘇聯已完成其對伊朗之義務，今吾人猶不知伊朗境內之其他外國軍隊是否已經撤退，事實上無人能知該處確况，但吾人應假定該處外軍業已完全撤退。莫浴托夫繼稱，外國軍隊之駐在希臘，無人能否認其正向該國內政局勢施行壓力，此外尙有美國與冰島因駐軍之事等，總之，駐軍問題爲國際間之重大問題，此蘇聯代表國之可以力主披露也。</p>
<p>英美反響</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿二日電〕美代表康納利事後吿記者稱，美國對於國內外駐軍人數，隨時可以依據大會決議，提出詳盡報吿。英代表團方面則謂，莫氏演說語氣和緩，惜與星期三言論並不一致。此外並悉，康氏與英代表諾爾員克將於明”會議時答復莫洛托夫。美國並擬於報吿國外駐軍問題及裁軍問題間提出折衷方案，俾以調和英蘇兩國主張，其內容尙未發表。惟悉美國以爲駐軍報吿問題，較之裁軍問題係屢次要性質，英蘇兩國提案今日聞可由政治委會提付表決。</p>

<p>渠繼稱：蘇聯在東歐及伊朗之擴張固應予以制止，但美國在遠東所採之經濟帝國主義政策亦應予以反抗，日本今日豈非已成美國之殖民地？社會主義的英國應代表世界向帝國主義反抗，固不論此等帝國主義，係左傾或右傾，美式或俄式也。吾人對美人所稱之「自由貿易」，不能苟同，美國欲藉「自由貿易」之便利，以把持世界市塲破壞他人利益；美國更利用放款，以施行政治壓力。吾人若與美國或蘇聯單獨連結，實力將不免愈弱，若能保持獨立與雙方合作，爲世界人民執言，始能保持強盛云。</p>

<p>〔本報紐約特派員廿三日電〕今日下午三時卅分，五强將根據英美計劃，處理否決權問題，以謀减少否決權使用之次數，藉以避免其他國家主張修改聯合國憲章之新要求。四强外長則將於下午五時會議，俾根據互讓原則，對特港問題成立某神協議，但貝爾納斯與貝文似不欲將巴黎和會所通過之方案多予修改。至於國外駐軍問題，蘇聯似可獲得部份滿足，歐洲方面之美國軍隊，將逐漸予以减少云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿二日電〕四外長會議對於蘇聯堅決要求特港駐軍定期撤退，可望覓得一折衷辦法。據稱，美國提議將國際地帶佔領軍，减至維持治安所必需之最低限度，當可由此獲得妥協。爭執中心在互相恐懼對方將如何述用否決權，如蘇聯爭得勝利，則於將來特港發生紛擾時，可阻止撤退之軍隊復回。反之，若將規定撤兵期限之權授諸安理會，一如西方各國所主張，則任何一國可無限期阻止撤兵。據參加討論者預料，現仍僵持之兩問題，其第二問題困難較少。僅集於蘇聯要求南斯拉夫參加特港鐵路管理權一點，莫洛托夫業已讓步，將特港南斯拉夫關稅同盟之要求與以放棄。</p>

<h3 id="c80">約大涂校長行就職典禮　美大使特來參加　建機三點語重心長 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市聖約翰大學新校長涂羽卿博士，昨日下午四時舉行就職典禮，司徒雷登大使特自京趕來參加，全體師生及來賓欣然出席，有學位敎職員約五十人，均衣形色學位禮服在座，典禮隆重，情况可謂熱烈。</p>
<p>司徒大使及來賓孔祥熙，英總領事台維斯，英總領事奧格頓等蒞校後，先在該校交誼應休息進茶。四時全體敎職員及貴賓集合於辦公廳前，穿戴各學位大禮服，點名排列二行，魚貫入大禮堂思　堂·司徒大使衣神學博士學位禮服，列入最後第三排，徐校長列最後第二排，名譽校長卜舫濟博士及董事長顏惠慶博士則列最後一排。</p>
<p>典禮開始，奏樂，整隊入席，台前滿置花籃，桌上置盾及銀杯各一，中問　紅綢包校印一枚。全體肅立唱國歌，羅主敎以國語致祈禱詞。</p>
<p>卜航濟范克林相繼致詞</p>
<p>卜舫濟博士任主席，首以國語繼以英語致詞，略稱：聖約翰大學在戰時經過了最艱難困苦的一個時期，現在戰事已結束，的大亦甚努力前進。的大有六十七年悠久歷史，今由校董會聘請涂羽卿博士擔任校長，涂博士才學淵博，經騐豐富，實係最適當之人，希望他爲的大努力，祝他成功。</p>
<p>繼由范克林博士代表設立人致詞稱：約大過去畢業生，在一社會上不論任何方面均有極大成就，此不但對中國有甚多貢獻，且對世界盡力，涂博士此次被推爲校長必能勝任，約大前途將有更大擴展及貢獻，謹代表設立人伸賀</p>
<p>司徒雷登演詞</p>
<p>司徒雷登大使在熱烈堂聲中，以沉重語氣，眞誠態度發表其國語演詞稱：「我被邀參加老友涂羽卿博士就任聖約翰大學校長一席的典禮，覺得榮幸。我現在不想用普通的詞句來表示賀意，我想請求諸位准許我以個人的立塲，來講幾句話。</p>
<p>在四十多年前，當我留學美國因來（塲中笑聲四起，大使亦笑，可見其時時以中國在念），而開始想到用什麼最好的方法來表達美國對華的善意的時候，我對於聖約翰大學已有的成功，感到很深的印象。後來我就任燕京校長的時候，我總想把聖約翰大學當做一種模範和鼓勵，並設法仿傚約大老校長卜舫濟博士的榜樣，那時我心中更特別想到怎樣根據中國當時的情形，使燕大對訓練中國靑年的貢獻，和聖約翰大學早年所完成的成績一樣。</p>
<p>所以我對於此地這個著名學府新校長的希望是出於我自已的經騐，我希望他將繼續的大的傳統精神，使的大的政策和活動，適應中國變動的情形，而能迎合現代學生的需要，並使他們學生能配合他們所選定的事業，像初期的的大足爲他校的標準一樣。</p>
<p>提出三個建議</p>
<p>關於這一點，我可以提出三個建議，怎樣使我們的一切基督敎大學能以最有效的方法，在現階段的發展中，爲中國服務。</p>
<p>第一，聖約翰大學新校長正在中國悠久歷史中最市要的時期，出任此職，現在是革命進步的第二期，也就是訓政時期，將進入眞正民主的時候。但是如果沒有聰明，愛國而勇敢活動的公民資格，依照環境的需要，擁護或指摘政府的事務，那末就不能有淸白而有效的民主政府。這應該是中國靑年的工作，而這個大學應該鼓勵，引導，並替他們準備這個最市要的任務。</p>
<p>第二，在我們現在所生活的世界中，人類必須維持和平的國際關係，否則人類受到戰爭的痛苦，而以後的戰爭將較以前人類歷史上所有的戰爭更可怖而破壞更大。大學的任務應該是對學生展開一種國際的瞻望，使其明瞭現有的種種世界問題，發展對我們共同人類的新的良心。它將使他們能够協助他們的國家行近孔子所說的世界大同的觀念，孔子曾說：「四海之內皆兄弟也」。</p>
<p>實現民生關鍵</p>
<p>第三，最後同時也可算是最重要的一點在於這些敎會大學負有一種無與倫比的使命，這種使命的眞實性不下當日設校初衷限於宣揚福音之事實，今日中國的政治困難和障碍歸根結底都是通德上的問題，發揚基督敎信仰的崇高領袖對於人民是非常有帮助，這一點已爲公衆所承認，誠如基督信條敎導我們，以及耶穌在生活中所奉行的，我們對社會與國家的服務，應該是由愛心和希望來激發，而去除一切自私和聲色，這一點對中國靑年將有莫大影響，這種影響也是實現民主和其他進步的關鍵。這和中國占時注重道德訓練和處世哲學的敎育符合，本人鑒於中國偉大歷史的傳統和聖約翰歷史的傳統的相似以及當前中國所面臨的嚴重問題，我謹向涂校長表示：我深信他將維持聖約翰原有的傳統，並設法適應當前中國的新需求，而適應需求，也就是聖的翰大學設校的宗旨。</p>
<p>顏惠慶主持就職禮</p>
<p>旋即由顏惠慶博士代表校董會主持就職典禮，正式授名約大校長並盼渠爲的大盡心盡力，增加的大榮譽。</p>
<p>新校長致答詞</p>
<p>最後即由新校長涂博士致答詞：表示本人學識淺陋，不敢担任此有六十七年光榮歷史大學之重任，但在各位校董督促，師生合作，友好鼓勵下，決願本基督服務精神。盡一部分力量。涂氏並闡述現代科學敎育之後果，贊同司徒大使所言，希望現代靑年應在生活中試騐認識人與人之關係，並當注意提高普通智識，根據的大校訓「學而不思則罔」涂氏特强調稱：「小學不思則罔，大學不思則亂。」</p>
<p>答詞畢，即唱　歌，由羅主敎祝福後於六時始散會。</p>

<h3 id="c81">市民醫病一槪免費　理想中的計劃　再等二十五年 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕都市計劃委員會衛生組小糾會議，最近由衛生局召開，工務局長趙祖康，衛生局長張維等主持。會中議決、二十五年以內，須大量添設衛生事務所。最合理想者，大城市中每十萬人即應有衛生事務所之設置。農村中因人口密度較小。則可以五萬人爲原則。依照本市都市計劃所決定，上海未來人口爲七百萬人計，則需銜生事務所七十單位，與現時本市所有者，距離尙遠。而市立醫院內之病床，尤應積極增加。希望在五年以內，每一千市民中有病床一張。十五年以內，每五百市民中有病床一張。廿五年以內，每三百市民有病床一張。而最後之理想，爲二十五年以後，市民診治一律免費。</p>
<p>此外於廿五年以內，本市之自來水必領能够普遍供應，而下水系統設備完善，則流行之傳染病即可减少。市區內之公園，體育塲及空地等，須大量增加，提倡火葬，使地面皆有充分之利用。將來之垃圾，除用以塡塞窪地及池浜外，更擬採用堆肥法，化廢物爲肥料，以利耕種。</p>
<p>衛生局除絡續努力，使上述美麗之憧憬促其實現外，現正積極籌建大規模肺病療養院一所，內設病床五百張，醫藥用具，藥品等，均由行總供給。最近因美國海員罷工，致遲遲未到。聞療養院之經費與地點，均無問題。</p>
<p>又衛生局擬於浦東，滬西，滬東等地，各建醫院一所，經費已經市府批准，醫藥用品等，行總亦允撥給，不日將可動工興築。</p>
<h3 id="c82">海關緝私防綫三道　走私之風已漸息 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進口許可制度實施後，海關對緝私工作將加强執行，並在積極研究提高效率之方法。據有關人士稱：海關復員之初，人力物力均感不足，故走私之風，甚爲猖獗，近兩個月來，因領海及港口檢查加强，破獲私貨多起，故情况已有改良。過去走私物品，不少爲運華救濟物資船隻上之水手所携帶者，目下此種情况，海關已能控制。關於外國兵艦之夾帶私貨，在領海上苦於無法檢查，但已在港口內加強陸上檢查，以爲補救。以前飛機亦爲私貨重要之來源，今則海關已派員經常駐守各機塲，日夜嚴加防範。目前海關之緝私，共有三道防綫：第一道爲大輪一隻，經常巡邏於吳淞口外；第二道爲小輪一隊，巡邏於港口附近；第三道爲檢查人員兩瞰，司船隻進口後檢查之職。</p>
<h3 id="c83">血漿之後又一糾葛　售出麻醉品　美方欲收回　立達行代表謁市長報告 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美剩餘物資中血漿被輾轉出售之糾紛甫吿解決，又發現醫藥用之麻醉品，亦混雜在出售物資之內。美物資淸理委員會並於前日發表聲明種：「對此事正進行澈查中，並將採取必要之適當措置。」</p>
<p>記者昨據立達貿易行方面稱，該行所購藥品之中，確有一部份麻醉品之類。惟究有若干種類，若干數量，則尙未確知。因當初所購物資自冲繩島運華之時，海關對於其中麻醉品即未准結關，須俟呈請內政部核準後始可進口，故此項麻醉品迄今尙雜存於各倉庫內未能淸理。昨日下午立達代表曾進謁市長，對於此點有所說明。</p>
<p>物資清理委員會雖已發表聲明，但截止昨日止，尚未開始與商人方面談判。據悉，清理委員會擬援例血漿敢回辦法，亦以其他藥品償價收回，但商人方面對於此批物資一再發生問題，頗有不勝其煩之感。蓋如純以商業立場而言，合法訂購之商品，實無退還之必要。且當初訂約之時，品名單上各種　品均詳載明白，即血漿亦然。故誤售之責任完全在於美方之疏忽，唯因不欲以此事牽涉邦交，故繼血漿之後，麻醉品之收回，恐亦爲無可避免之事，所待談判者僅爲條件而已。</p>
<p>又美方究以何種藥品　付收回之血漿，尙待明日（星期一）物資淸理委員會與海軍及陸戰隊三方商議後，始能決定。</p>
<h3 id="c84">進出口商登記期　擬請再展延七天 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口同業公會以最近行政院頒行修正進出口貿易辦法及施行細則等，有關該會同業權益甚鉅，昨日下午三時，特召開理監事聯席會議，一出席理監事共卅餘人，由理事長張煥章主席。輸管會執委會秘書處長陳長桐，臨時因事不克出席。討論經過，議決要案多起，最重要者有二點：（一）修正辦法中對進出口商之登記期間，限於十一月十七日起，十五日內辦理完竣，似嫌過於侷促，擬請再展期七日。（二）業經許可進口之貨物，擬請從速規定最短日期，簽發許可證。</p>
<p>又據進出口業人士觀察：最近二三週，以辦理進出。商登記事宜，中央銀行及各指定銀行之結匯事宜，已無形宣吿停頓云。</p>

<p>肅清水上竊風運動</p>
<p>繼由竊課長報告：最近黃浦江一帶，竊風甚熾，宣局長爲維護行旅，於上星期六特下令刑事處及十五個分局，實施肅淸水上竊風運動，經一星期來偵查結果，先後已逮捕竊犯一二九名，收贓犯十六名，共計一四五名。已於今日（廿三日）併解地檢處，今後本局仍本原定計劃，逐步「由點而面」「由陸而水」「由中而外」三點辦理，並實飾經常的全面性防範，至被捕之竊犯，「本領」高强者即所謂「水老鼠」，約佔四分之一，若輩行竊對象：（一）船隻剛抵埠時，（二）碼頭，（三）倉庫，其方法係利用；（一）小工假公濟私或員工監守自盜，（二）卸貨工人在搬遝貨物時，故意將木箱墜損，使貨物散落地上，（三）假託裝運。</p>
<p>竊風盛行　　結所在</p>
<p>氏旋又分析此種竊風盛行之徵結謂：（一）因惡勢力之不易剷除，（二）碼頭工人工資被工頭轉讓剝削所得極微，（三）船隻多而無管制。至於收贓犯，亦有其特殊組織，眞正首領，不易落網，蓋彼等大部均利用歸孺，分赴各碼頭及倉庫所在地，陸續收買，彙集後始予整批出售。最後劉氏聲稱：今次逮捕工作雖屬消極性，　在治安機關立塲，爲維持治安，及喚起市民注意，乃有此遊行之舉云。</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞昨日西南工商專業旅滬工作人員，假座同孚路新生活俱樂部，歡宴來滬之重慶銀行公會理事長范衆渠氏，列席者多川籍旅滬知名人士。記者晤范氏，詢以川省金融及經濟近況，承群爲剖析如下：川省及重慶目前之金融市場，較上海爲穩定，普通商業借款之利息爲大一分。</p>
<p>九月底曾一度上漲至一角二分左右，但經發行十億公庫券後，立即壓平。金融市場之所以比較穩定，主因爲：（一）物價遠較京滬爲低，約爲六分之一，重慶猪肉賣六百元一斤，餘可類推。（二）商業上大宗賣買之規模與次數，均不能與上海市場相比擬，市場上頭寸之調集易於計算。（三）重慶各商業銀行交換支票每日有兩次，與此間每日僅下午交換一次者不同。其好處在一次交換後，即能推算當日需準備頭寸之數目。如此銀行不致多提準備款項，一部份資金不致凍結，間接减低其利息之負担，市場利率亦不致提高。過去亦有人主張提高利率，免使游資因銀行利息太低，將其囤積物資，爲經人反對後，未成事實。至於目前四川之工商業，亦爲普遍不景氣。以工業而論，產品之成本較之外貨爲高，難於競爭。商業則過去一般商店鑒於物價有上漲傾向，儘量進貨，今舶來品大量入口，物美價廉，使囤貨之商家，欲拋貨而不可得。川人對於外銷物資如豬鬃桐油等寄以厚望，但今日運輸問題困難，川江船隻大部征作軍運，使物資外運大受阻碍。惟雖有以上種種情形，川省之經濟環境終較穩定，過去某工業家預言我國工商業不景氣之浪潮，自外而及內，勸人在四川辦工業，較爲安全。今日視之，有其見解。</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞市輪渡籌備處爲發展浦江兩岸輪渡事業，特籌辦卡車輪渡，經實地沿江勘察結果，認爲南市建築最爲適宜。下列二碼頭可供建築：（一）浦東輪站地位，以南碼頭路江邊爲適宜，該處輪站地位大半爲市有公地，將來可擴充廣大地位，車場陸上交通與浦東大道亦可銜接。（二）浦西輪站地位，以浦西陸家浜支路沿江爲適宜，因沿岸地位寬大，且無重要事業工程設施。爲求推進迅速起見，擬與行總倸合作方式。設備器材船隻，由行總供給。俟岸綫地畝使用權取得後，即由市輪渡公司着手興工，爲其二月至三月即可完成。卡車輪渡碼頭之設計方式有二：（甲）採用上海通行浮塢式樣，即渡船與岸綫平行，車輪利用引橋，由輪渡側面登陸。（乙）建築固定引橋或活動吊橋，車輛由渡船之首或尾駛入。上兩方式，經專家商討結果，認爲後者較爲穩妥。然甲種方式雖不及乙種之使用便利，然因器材設備，可利用行總現有物資，可早日完成。俟此綫開行後，再繼續進行設置較永久性之輪站及船隻。</p>

<p>（一）肺病咳血</p>
<p>黃維祺問　鄙人現年廿五歲時，男性，未婚，十七歲曾患咳血症，屢經醫師檢視，皆認爲肺部正常，十九歲時舊病復發，再照X光始發現右肺尖部黑點兩處，斷爲硬性結核，然亦未加療治，自後每遇操勞過度，即咳血約一碗。茲有疑問數則，望予賜答：（一）此症應如何治療？（二）鄙人病灶在剛年後始被發現，故以爲肺之生病，實在吐血之後，就醫理言，有此可能否？（三）如何可以防止吐血？根治肺結核之藥物有否發明？（四）止血針漿何者效　最著？（五）此病有痊愈希望否？</p>
<p>﹝醫學博士顧毓琦答﹞　（一）既有X光照片斷爲肺結核，則宜積極治療，靜臥，多滋養，施行人工氣胸術，或一面注射葡萄糖鈣，及維太命西等；（二）吐血即是肺結核之症象，根本治愈，則吐血自然停止；（三）防治吐血最要休養靜臥，人工氣胸術，即止咳劑；（四）吐血時可用止咳劑，如Codein等，止血劑，可用Coagulen，Clauden　Phrombogen等（五）或有痊愈希望務必積極治療。</p>
<p>（二）結合痔管</p>
<p>王惠民問　鄙人在九年前患痔瘡。初起時肛門前後方各起一核，發癢，半年後，核破生孔，日流膿水，現以日久，後者似有硬根，而肛門左側又生一個茲有問題數則請解答。（一）是否痔漏，能否根除？（二）此症應如何治療，如不得已時動用手術有無危險？</p>
<p>﹝醫學博士顧毓琦答﹞　（一）根據來信所述各種，恐係結核性痔管；（二）可先用人工太陽燈照射後填塞藥布，每日一次，茍久不痊愈，則可用手術治療之，用局部麻醉，無危險，同時須服多種維太命丸，及其他魚肝油丸，補血藥水等，亦可注射葡萄糖鈣，維太命西等，因恐與肺結核有關，最好用X光透視診斷之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨買戶又湧，央行供源不多，再起漲風，晨開二六〇萬五左右，開後即有爭買，升至二六一萬七，此後在二六一萬左右，迄二六二萬之間徘徊而已。迨央行以二六二萬之價，配給六〇條後，人心蠶然又動，而央行本其彈性策略，供　又告呆滯，形成求過於供，時逢週末，購貯待變者紛紛而來，市價逐步抬高，午刻已漲到二六五萬以上，午後現交會扳高二六七萬以上，而後稍回、結果較前收再升五萬三，飾金升至念八萬，紋銀銀元尚平，暗拆仍在一角至一角半之間。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕近兩日來黃金又起波動，中央銀行當局頗爲重視，除大量拋售以遏阻漲風外，並嚴密澈查役機份子，尤對銀錢業之業務從嚴監管，但據金融業方面消息，此次黃金之漲風，純爲非法商人掀風作浪，黃金存底旣充裕，到源亦甚暢，預料前途不至漫無止境云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪吳市長於市府，提出有關食油及棉紗問題多則，承分別解答如次：（一）日來油市停頓，對本市食油前途，有無影響？答：本市食油每月經常由國民營各榨油廠供給三萬六千担，再加販運商自外埠運到之食油，每月可供配售之食油，已逾五萬担。故本市食油之平價供應，可告無成，惟居間商在市塲買賣食油，常有超逾議價之事發生，乃着令暫時停市。故油市停頓，不致影響本市食油前途。（二）聞各食油居間商，要求上海食油聯配處，對各廠配油酌提小佣，市長是否允予考慮？答：居間商因各廠食油直接提供聯配處配售，佣金無着，固屬實情，惟考其所代表之利益，究屬少數，且居間商超逾議價之黑市交易，蒙受損害者，即爲大多數之市民，當局立塲，當以維獲大衆之福利爲前提。此次驚令油市塲暫停交易，一在禁絕黑市食油買賣，二在使居間商知所警惕。至是否允予酌提小佣一點，尚待考慮再定。（三）聞市長日來派員調查輸運出口之棉紗，是否確實？答：確有其專。爲防止本市棉紗混朦出口起見，派員隨時抽查各紗出口情形，實屬必要。例如：複製業各公會所領到之配紗，祗能供複製業自身生產之用。如有轉輾輸往外埠之情事，當在查禁之列。（四）各紗廠自由運銷外埠之一部份紗額，是否亦須事先聲請許可？答：各紗廠自由運銷外埠之紗額，須向紡管會陳報登記，毋需請領許可出口證。（五）自紡管會決定將各廠一部份之產紗，配售予紗商公會中各廠素有往來之老會負後，何以今日（廿三日）紗商市塲，仍乏大廠開紗？答：紡管會自決定該項措施後，茲各紗廠正擬集議，如何輪流按日開紗辦法。總之，每月產紗總額中，應分配於紗商部份之棉紗，必儘一個月中，先後配售完畢，（六）紡管會除辦理本市棉紗之配售外，對外埠是否亦將同樣辦理？答：目前以本市棉紗運銷於外埠各地者，爲數頗多，故第一步將先從穩定本市紗價着手，則各地紗價，亦將隨以穩定，迨本市棉紗供應納入正軌後，當再考慮外埠棉紗之配銷也</p>

<h3 id="c160">美國政治舞台上的九頭鳥　華萊士當文化人 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>十七日紐約航訊</p>
<p>在美國政海浮沉中，華萊士眞是一個十足的『怪人』。許多美國人，對華萊士的思想言行，簡直無法瞭解，他有時候很天眞，看見羣衆的歡呼，手舞足蹈起來，有時候很重濁，一下子會把整個政治空氣，都遮上一層陰霾。如今，在美國，除了共產黨整日價喊著『工人』以外，一般勞動者，都把華萊士認爲他們眞正的朋友，但是他本身，却又是中西部的大莊園地主出身。據說，華萊士從他祖宗手裏接受的遺產，數目大得可觀。因此，在華萊士的一生之中，就根本沒有嘗到人閒的艱苦與辛酸。華萊士本人，至今還能够在政治舞台上保持三分『天眞氣』，朱始不是他環境促成的功績。</p>
<p>華萊士繪成女裝</p>
<p>商務部長被迫辭職的那天，華萊士成爲被全國注目的焦點，就我看見的紐約新聞界的態度說吧：全市十餘家早晚報，除了共產黨的『每日工人報』，馬歇飛的『下午報』，對華萊士擁護同情，『每日郵報』態度比較中立以外，其他的大大小小的報紙，都指斥華萊士的荒唐演講。辭職前一天，華萊士進白宮，謁見杜魯門總統，他們會談了三小時，一度傳說獲得了妥協，妥協的內容是：在巴黎和會閉幕以前，華萊士不作攻擊外交政策的演講，華萊士本身，仍然爲內閣的一員，仍然任美國的商務部長。這消息傳到紐約，紐約銷數最大的『每日新聞』，當天寫了一簾社論，題目呌做『總統，我們對你失望』！裏面說：華萊士是美國政治舞台上最卑賤的妓女，賣身給赤色法西斯。還說：『如果總統把華萊士留在規內閣，必將喪失政府的威信，使美國愛國人民，對民主黨政府失望，』並且還畫了一幅漫畫，把華萊士畫成女裝，『倚閭賣笑』，道旁史達林元帥手持能熊貓槍，昻首而過。</p>
<p>第二天，杜魯門總統，以電話迫華萊士辭職，紐約各報，都用『逐出』二字爲標題，逐出的原因，現在還是一個秘密，白宮內外的記者羣，都斷定是巴黎來的長途電話的影響，但是貝爾納斯在巴黎答復新聞記者，說他根本沒有要挾杜魯門總統，驅逐華萊士。這是一個非常有趣的民主黨三巨頭的明爭暗鬥，正如同托洛斯基，史達林，布哈林當年的情景一樣，不過一個是民主國家，一個是寡頭國家，因此，所用的政治鬥爭的方式不一樣，鬥爭的結果也不一樣。</p>
<p>十年前領導左派</p>
<p>這段公案如果要追述起來，恐怕要回溯到一九四四年冬天的民主黨全國代表大會，那時候，華萊土領導的左派（工人團體與新自由主義者），以及貝爾納斯的右派，爲副總統問題爭執得相特不下。那時候，羅斯福總統還在世，他沒有出席『全國代表大會』，他的演說稿，請人代爲宣讀，大意說：關於推舉候選人問題，他希望與一九四〇年相同，這意思，即是說：希望華萊士重行當選，但是，他在另一電文中，又祝賀貝爾納期的努力，希望他能膺選。這是羅斯福當年『不偏不倚』的妙用，後來，相持不決，黨裏面幾個後台老板，才棒出比較中立穩健的杜魯門出來。想不到：羅斯福竟死在那一屆任上，民主黨本身的隙縫便完全暴露。</p>
<p>我不預備詳細追述那些更料，三個月以前，我很早替本報報導過民主黨分裂的預兆，那是在華萊土事件發生以前很久。華萊士辭職那天，紐約各報備盡挖苦諷刺的能事。紐約每日鏡報，刋出了華萊士的封面照相，旁邊寫：『一個失了業的人』。許多人預料華萊士將進行組織第三大政黨，因爲美國若干工人團體，例如最有力的C·I·O·（中國譯爲詩埃奧工會）便是華萊士的有力支持者。</p>
<p>女公子珍妮成婚</p>
<p>但是，華萊士並沒有做。商務部長交卸以後，華萊士便搬到華德門公園公寓住下，那是華盛頓相當幽靜的處所，公寓附近有大草坪，有整齊的花園，後面還有游泳池和網球塲。華萊士一家住得那麼安靜，像超脫了世俗的煩囂一樣。</p>
<p>各國記者們曾經去華德門公寓訪問過他，他說：他爲他女公子珍妮小姐的婚事很忙，他說：他雖然辭了職，但他得遵守諾言：在巴黎和會結束以前，不作任何批評外交政策的演講。　珍妮小姐的婚禮，非常簡單，總統夫人那天去參加的，杜魯門總統却沒有到塲。有位有風趣的同業，事後問杜魯門總統，總統的同答很輕鬆：『參加婚禮嗎？我一生就沒幹過』。</p>
<p>老帮手紛紛求去</p>
<p>『一朝天子一朝臣』，商務部的職員，也很有了些更動，主任秘書漢洛楊，一向是華萊士的老幫手，跟着部長一起辭職，現在在華盛頓重振旗鼓，又掛上了律師招牌。新部長上任，第一着便宣佈：人事一律不更動，但仍然有若干中級幹部，紛紛求去，許多人改了行，參加到工商界。這些人，倒並不是爲前任部長『效忠』，那是因公務員的薪給太苦，而工商界的待遇『太好』。</p>
<p>靠祖產年收五萬</p>
<p>華萊士本人並不急急於求出路，紐的『每日新聞』駐華府的記者說：華萊士靠祖宗的遣產，一年可以收人五萬元的利息或租金。（包括動產與不動產），因此，他無所求於任何人。那位記者說：他有的是政治野心——一九四八年的『總統之夢』。</p>
<p>兩黨制竭力歌頌</p>
<p>我不敢斷言他沒有總統之夢？我覺得民主國家的政治常軌與政治道德，都十分可愛，華萊士被民主黨政府所驅逐，但是，臨到大選的前夜，華萊士仍然爲民主黨賣力。無論如何，在競選的塲合中，民主黨需要華萊士，透過華萊士的所謂左翼，民主黨可以取得「工黨」與『自由黨』小派系的合作。例如：這次紐約州的競選，米德是民主黨的州長候選人，也是工黨，自由黨，民主黨的聯合候選人。李門是民主黨的上議員候選人，也是工黨，自由黨，民主黨的候選人。在辭職前一個多月的某一天，我在哥摩都飯店，聽過華萊士的演講，他歌頌兩黨制，他說：『祇有兩黨制，才能眞正的進循憲政常軌』。</p>
<p>兩星期旅行演講</p>
<p>上月間，華盛頓週團傳佈著貝爾納斯要辭職的消息，甚至連國務院方面的人士，也認爲他們的國務卿，有辭職的可能。在另一方面，華莢士的兩星期旅行演講計劃，要爲民主黨大大賣勁。華萊士計劃先到印第安那，密歇根，再到西部加利福尼亞，華盛頓州，轉明尼蘇達，盛斯康辛，最後在選舉前夜趕回紐約。共和黨的言論，以及反『新經濟政策』派的無黨派人士，對華萊士又重複開始攻擊。</p>
<p>甚『猪肉恐慌』最嚴重的日子，有位共和黨衆議員，渥亥渥州的吉更斯，在國會火駡華萊士，他說：『如今美國老百姓，爲什麼沒有肉吃？推根究源，要追溯到華萊士，這位危險的共產主義者，他佈擺了什麼管制那一套』。那位衆議員，甚至把華萊士比成魔鬼。</p>
<p>當編輯重作馮婦</p>
<p>現在呢？華萊士已正式受聘『新共和』雜誌的編輯，編輯的合同從十二月十六日開始，他懷着滿腔興奮，參加美國文化人的隊伍。他在十三年以前，曾經在依阿華州辦過內容非常幼稚的農村的刋物。一別十三年，他決心重操筆墨生涯了</p>
<p>這是一件平凡中含有『不平凡』的新聞。紐約先鋒論壇報，和紐約時報，都爲華萊士寫了社評。紐約時報閱：新共和雜誌，在美國是一個具有聲望的刊物，他以左傾著稱，鼓吹新的經濟制度，但並非聽命於莫斯科，這與華萊士先生的志趣正相合，華萊士旣與現政府之外交政策不合，自以不留任內閣爲宜，如今華萊士先生旣已退出政府，受任自由身份的編輯職務，正可以抒展所長。「在吾人民主國度中，希望華萊士先生儘量發揮高見　論，並表白爲世界和平致力的一片赤忱」。</p>
<p>紐約前鋒論壇報的社論說：『華萊士先生就任新共和雜誌編輯，眞可謂適才適所，』……十餘年前，華氏曾參加新聞界，厠身文化事業。華萊士先生有批評的天才，對廣大軍衆有感勸力，希望能發揮此種『批評精神』，在今後的『新共和雜誌』披露。接著，前鋒論壇報還說：『在同一內閣之中，有兩種以上不同的外交意見，無疑會减弱美國外交的國際地位，因此，華萊士先生以退出內閣爲適宜』。『新共和雜誌，是一個被稱爲新自由主義Neo—Librnllsm的刋物，一向擁護羅斯福新政，正與華萊士先生口胃相合』。前鋒論壇報的結論，和時報一樣希望他好好幹，發揮名言　論。</p>
<p>在美國，新共和雜誌，銷數並不大，它沒有圖畫照片，也沒有廣告，印刷很獃板，紙張很糙劣。但是，它的內容，對內政和外交都有相當影響。新共和雜認的創辦人是斯屈萊脫，於一九一四年創刋，第一任編輯是克羅萊，它擁護羅斯福新政，本來便是接近民主黨左翼的刋物。在美國，許多自命爲前進開明的自由主義者，常常被新共和雜誌的文章驚倒，因爲新共和雜誌比他們更『前進』，甚且更『自由』！</p>
<h3 id="c161">訪問焦作 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>十三日航訊</p>
<p>焦作是河南的「小上海」。她本是修武縣的一個鎭，因爲出產豐富的煤，形成她的特殊。因爲煤的出產，使她繁榮——她過去擁有十數萬的居民，商業也很興盛，人民生活也很富足！也因爲煤本身的力量，一直到今天更讓人覺得她的重要。她從去年九月二日就被共黨的軍隊「接收」了，那條道淸鐵路也同時被破壞得一塌糊塗了。</p>
<p>豫北繼豫東之後，又給戰火燃燒了。從八月中旬共軍在劉伯誠指揮下，動員太行軍區二十八個團的兵力圍攻李振西將軍防守的輝縣城後，豫北這在上古夏商周列國時代都很重要的土地——修武縣原呌寗，周武王伐紂時「勒兵於寗」，改「寗」呌修武的——從此就戰雲彌佈了。焦作在本月十二日上午十二時，就被國軍收復了。</p>
<p>共軍在焦作外綫　曾建有堅強工事</p>
<p>焦作的收復是一般人意料之內，同時是意料之外的事情——誰也沒想到她會這樣快！共黨更沒想到會這樣快就失去了焦作的，想到的話就要狠狠地破壞一氣的。從去年九月起，共軍就陸續把焦作的東西往太行山老窠里搬，他們也知道焦作是住不長久的。</p>
<p>共軍在焦作的外綫五里舖，靳村，霍村，待王寨（等待周武王的去處）前後下莊一些地方，都建築了堅固的工事，並且利用了他們破壞了的道淸路的材料，作成碉堡，濠溝，很費了工夫與民力呢！但是道條共軍的馬其諾防錢，却沒利用上，而焦作就被國軍收復了。</p>
<p>國軍主力迂迴戰　進佔了煤礦山頭</p>
<p>收復焦作的是國軍三十二師，商震將軍訓練下的軍隊，這支隊伍的馬球是很有名的。師長唐永良將軍不祗愛騎馬，而且還畫馬畫的也出色。他在王仲廉將軍指揮下，進行了收復焦作的戰鬥在十月十一日他的隊伍在待王寨一些地方，同共軍對峙，夜里他部把主力調到側翼，迂迥到共軍的後方去，「避實就虛」，進佔了煤礦的山頭，進佔了焦作，爲的是避免犧牲，而更重要的不要共軍把煤礦也同別的煤礦一樣都破壞了，使整個的河南，也都給煤壓迫死了，任何地方都鬧着煤荒。</p>
<p>焦作，這河南的「小上海」，已不是過去的模樣了。在共黨政權下，工人受不了壓迫，農人經不住徵派，商人堪不了鬥爭，居一民們被土痞流氓「無產階級」「革命鬥士」的「翻身運動」，死一的死，逃的逃，十數萬的人口現一在只有一兩萬了，她怎能不像花一樣凋敗了呢？</p>
<p>機件無多大損害　短期內恢復開採</p>
<p>王封，李對，三十九號井以及許多具有規模的小礦，在共黨摧殘下，早沒過去產量了。現在里邊都給水充滿着。軍隊正協同着礦上的負責人進行復礦的工作，好在機器沒多大損害，短期內就可開採的。</p>
<p>在焦作收復後，電信人員同郵局很快的就來展開工作，郵局在收復的第三天，就開始收信件了。農行也派員進行復行貸款的工作，綏署，省府，省黨部，救濟分署也派員來視察了——一復員的工作都在進行了。</p>
<p>焦作是經過共黨「革命」試騐過的地方，她在共黨手中是一天天走向敗落，悽慘的境地的，什麼時候她才能復原呢？這里的一切現象，正是「慘目傷懷，悽凉難回首！」</p>
<p>交部修築道清路　復甦豫南的動脈</p>
<p>人民們扶老携幼的又絡繹不絕的回到這裏來了，他們要走過那破壞了的村鎭，荒蕪的田地，同滿臉菜色的鄉人打着招呼，心裏是什麼味覺啊！</p>
<p>交部已令飭路局進行道淸路的復路工作了，希望路能很快的修成，讓豫北的土地同人民，就靠着這條動脈復蘇過來。</p>
<p>共軍留給豫北土地與人民的是痛苦，邊幣該怎樣處置？土地問題，財產問題等等，希望都有很快而又妥善的解決方法。</p>
<p>平綏平漢兩綫　視察觀感</p>
<p>最後，孫長官就他兩月來在平綏平漢兩綫視察的觀感說：看到各地人民生活的痛苦，愈加感到人民的可愛。凡曾被共軍攻佔的地方，對政府所派縣長和公敎人員殺害甚多，甚至於曾爲政府做過勞工的貧苦民衆，也都被共軍在晚上加以暗殺。共軍在各地所製成的恐怖，已經使百姓生活無法安定。徵糧斂款，更使百姓欲活不能，共軍在各地徵糧，竟至於向民衆要抗戰八年的糧賦，商店也全被共軍統制公營，老百姓說，一切全是替他們幹了。</p>
<p>孫長官從唐山回來時，記者再度訪晤於車站。他表示爲加强冀東的地方治安，已決定在冀東綏靖司令部下組設一個黨政軍民聯合辦事處，這樣可以免去過去的散漫情形。孫氏這一次唐山之行，同時還決定了以有力部隊運用在北寗路外側，沿綫守護工作，則注重着民衆組織的强化。他認爲非如此，交通的安全是無從保障的。</p>

<p>— 本報天津特約記者　李紹林</p>
<p>五日航訊</p>
<p>第十一戰區司令官孫連仲，日昨由北平來天津，並從天津去了一次唐山，四日由唐山過津返平。孫長官道决到天津來，記者曾兩度看見他，第一次是當他初到時，在他的臨時行邸裏，第二次則在他由唐山歸來時，相晤於車中。</p>
<p>第一次的訪問，談話時閒很長，接觸的問題也很廣泛，那一天恰是平漢北段國軍打通，但會師消息尚未傳到。記者一問到這個問題，孫長官就回答說：「今天已經打通了」。記者問：「在河北省內，共軍會不會發動另一次攻勢呢」？他的回答極具輕鬆之感，他說：「談不到有甚麼攻勢，不過天氣冷了，共軍難免自山區中向平原騷擾，但不會形成甚麼問題。在軍事方面，還談到共軍對陝北榆林的圍攻，孫氏表示榆林的安全並沒有問題，共軍行動也不過騷擾而已。言及平漢北段的情形，孫長官對共軍在沿綫破壞的情形說得很詳細，他說：在定興，北新河，高碑店各地，共軍退走時，不但公用的建築都被破壞，就是學校以及民間房舍也都被毁了。</p>
<p>在河北省行政方面，記者首先叩詢到各地地方秩序和政令推行的情形。孫氏說：地方秩序還說不上良好，但是都在逐漸恢復着，政令實施也是如此。各地經過共軍長時閒佔據的，推行政令容或還不能普遍貫澈，但走入軌道，也祇是時間問題。</p>
<p>話題落在難民身上　強調民衆組訓工作</p>
<p>記者又問孫長官：政府對收復區土地政策推行如何？他說：省府對收復區土地整理，以前已經擬定了辦法，現在逐步推行，並沒有遇到甚麼困難。河北省的農民大多是小康之家，每戶一般不過耕田七八十畝，生活大都還安定，問到對收復區難民的救濟工作情形時孫長官謂：凡政令達到的地方，善後救濟總署都已經派了人辦理振濟。孫氏這時對難民加以分析說：「有辦法的難民，都已經跑到平津來避難了。留在當地的，多半是貧苦無告的農民，而也正是最能帮忙我們的。修路，築橋，運傷兵等等工作，都靠着他們協助」。我說：協助這些難民渡過寒冬，並且帮忙他們，不要因爲戰事影響而有誤明春的農耕，該是當前一個重大的問題。孫長官道：「除了以工代振外，對於老弱婦孺，都已經在設法安插，明年春耕沒有甚麼問題，百姓已可以安然的在田間耕作」。</p>
<p>話題在難民上進行，我再問對於難民要求武裝還鄉，政府是否要加以協助？孫長官的回答說：政府自然願意難民都能早日返鄉，安居樂業，但是地方的保衛，他認爲地方人民應該與政府積極合作，他舉定縣爲例，說：那裏沒右國軍防守，但是人民有嚴密的組織和訓練，並且有自己構築的工事，所以共軍雖然圍攻了三個月，終於不能攻下來。這個事實，已經使那一帶的民衆深切感到組訓工作的重要了。後來談到河北省敎育復員的情形，孫長官云：河北全省每年經費是五十三億元，敎育經費不過佔其中一部份，而各地學校均遭到慘重破壞，稍微加以修葺，就常是需費數億元，經費頗爲困難。</p>

<h3 id="c164">香港市景 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約南洋旅行記者求艾</p>
<p>十九日香港航訊</p>
<p>一別五年，香港的外表還是那樣，可是戰時的損失，戰後交通的困難，統制的嚴厲，致香港市塲的表現，顯然和戰前不同。</p>
<p>銀行林立</p>
<p>戰前香港的銀行業不大發達。戰後，除原有的銀行相繼復業外，新開的銀行有中國農民，西南興業，中國工業，浙江興業，華僑聯合，正和，川鹽等銀行；行將開幕的有昆明商業等銀行，而新成立的大火小小的公司洋行更是不計其數。在國內，因爲幣値不穩定，市塲上拆息很高，大一分，大二分的拆息很平常，即銀行存款，也可得到五六分。在香港，因爲幣値相當穩定（事實上已經貶値），多數銀行存款是沒有利息的，即有，也不過年利一二厘。基於內戰的蔓延，生活負祖的繁重，國內的有產階級紛紛跑到香港。這些人帶來的游資，沒有什麼出路，有的人組織銀行，有的人經營出入口貿易。最近因爲人口激增，房荒的問題越來越嚴重，有些富商巨賈擬從事地產房產的買賣興建。例如皇后大道的公主行（MarinaHouse），有人擬在屋頂上增建三層樓，費用約需百萬元港幣，可是這三層樓將來所得的頂費就不止百萬元，而且要預先付款。</p>
<p>銀行的增加，從事金銀買賣的銀號也比例地增加。其中規模較大的銀號且私設電台，時時刻與上海廣州，及其他各大城發生聯繫。在這金融行情起落無常的時期，一個消息只要比較人家早十分鐘，便可獲得巨利。商人重利不顧法，有時爲私設電台，被軍警破獲的也是常事。</p>
<p>航空發達</p>
<p>香港的海上交通還沒有完全恢復，不過航空事業比較從前發展，飛行决數也增加。除中國，中央二航空公司專門聯絡香港和中國各大城外，專走香港和南洋各地的有東方，環亞，商業三家航空公司，往返香港，馬尼刺，檀香山的有菲律賓航空公司，來往香港倫敦間的有英國海外航空公司。法國航空公司在香港設辦事處；不過目前牠的航綫只從巴黎到西貢，山西貢到香港，這一段須由英國的飛機代庖。泛美航空公司，從舊金山經太平洋羣島而達香港，由香港飛往仰光，加爾卡塔，然後換一架飛機，逕飛歐洲，渡大西洋而達美國。這種環球的飛行事業，大的十二月間可開始。最有趣味的，就是香港浪門間將有航運，每天早出晚歸，單程只須二十分鐘。</p>
<p>基於航空的發達，香港的機塲發生問題。九龍城啓德機塲，一來是附近有大山，二來是跑道太短，不能適應這航空時代，所以大規模的新機塲的建築，變成香港政府，各大航空公司，及一般旅客最關心的問題。</p>
<p>起初香港政府擬建築屏山機場，後來據說這機場不適合國際民航的標準，同時因爲中國政府及人民異口同聲地反對，所以到了本年四月三日則放棄屏山機塲的計劃。</p>
<p>其次是計劃在深水灣建築一近代化的機場，預算建築費達四百萬鎊。這機塲的建築工程相常浩大，先要把地雷將四百萬方碼的花崗石炸掉，然後用這些碎石來修塡深水灣西岸的海邊。機塲有兩個跑道，各長三千碼。現定明年一月開工，到了後年（一九四八）年底全部工程可以完成。</p>
<p>黃金活躍</p>
<p>雖然鈔票支票的行使，已經有相當長久的歷史，可是人們對於閃閃爍爍的可以摸捉的黃金還是另眼相看。</p>
<p>截至十月底止，從外國流入香港市塲的黃金不下十萬兩，這筆黃金是來自墨西哥。當大戰期中，美國向墨西哥所購的原料，多以黃金償還，每兩按美金三十五元計算。戰後，香港的一些長袖善舞的商人向墨西哥定購，每兩爲美金四十一元，加上經手費，保險費，每兩合美金四十四元。</p>
<p>定購墨西哥黃金的銀行和銀號賺了一大筆錢。原價不過四十四元的黃金，就地出手，可得美金六十元，純利爲百分之五十。跑經紀的人再運到廣州，又賺了有分之十至十五的利潤。換句話說，國內購買黃金的人，比較原價多付百分之六十。不過國幣天天跌價，誰又能够攔阻人民不顧一切購買黃金，而不儲藏國幣？</p>
<p>商人到底聽明，一轉手就是錢。有了錢，不但倨傲的蘇秦的嫂子也得肅然起敬，就是縱橫捭闔的國際舞台上何曾不是運用金元外交？</p>
<p>美貨充斥</p>
<p>香港給日本佔據了三年又八個月，這短短時間的隔離，弄得一般人民不知道外界的情形到底是怎樣。去年此日，捷足先得的商人運了一批美貨到香港，利市十倍。例如原價美金一元的藥品賣到港幣二百元。原價美金十五元的自來水筆也賣到二百元。香港政府雖嚴厲統制入口，撲滅走私，可是英國貨遲遲不來美國貨却越來越多。最近美國罷工問題解決，滿裝着價廉物美的商船，將源源開到。這問題弄到以高價囤積美貨的商人急得像熟鍋上的螞蟻。</p>
<p>幾個月前，許多商人曾向美國公司洋行定貨。因爲海上交通關係，貨物還沒有運到。這些商人眼看香港的美貨快要達到飽和點，所以日來向出入口洋行請求退還定款的大有人在</p>
<p>現在香港各大公司及一切洋貨店·西藥店·鐘錶店，固然滿是美國配備，即街頭巷尾也堆滿各種各式的美貨。我每决經過華人行的騎樓下邊總聽到小販們大聲喊着：『美國火柴，一元三大包，可以當柴燒。』『美國鉛筆，一元五枝，比較公價柴還便宜。』目前新式的美國汽車，香港還不如上海那麼多，但是財可通神的富商巨賈，不久可以把香港九龍的馬路上排滿排滿美國汽車。</p>
<p>老實親，美國商品的來勢比較從前的日本貨兇猛得多。日木貨的唯一好處就是便宜，可是品質惡劣，種類有限，美國商品不似物美價廉，而且花樣層出不窮，從軍用品至必需品，從新式玻璃製造品至各種化裝品，應有盡有。此外，從前中國人買日本貨，心裏都不大好過，現在中國人，甚至世界各國人購買美國商品，心裏反而覺得光榮。這種精神上的繳械，對於市塲上的影響實在太大了。</p>

<h3 id="c165">談「捉鬼傳」 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>一個富於諷刺的笑劇</p>
<p>一個笑劇（Farce）的目的，只是不斷地要觀衆笑。因此，它的內容就無法離開挖苦和諷刺。</p>
<p>吳祖光大胆地用新的方法寫完了這本笑劇「捉鬼傳」。他把古代一直拉到現代，爲的是說明：鍾馗酒醉，一臥千年，在千年之中未曾捉鬼，所以使這世界變成了鬼世界。</p>
<p>「捉鬼傳」裏沒有故事，有的話也是很簡單的說：鍾馗雖中狀元，因貌醜未被錄用，碰死殿上。陰間閻王封他爲捉鬼大神，他至陽閒捉鬼成功，酒醉一臥千年；醒來時，陽世已成鬼世界了。但作者在這簡單的故事裏插穿了不少好材料，使這劇生色不少。</p>
<p>這劇的主題，並不在這故事的本身，反而在那些有趣味的穿插裏。它是盡世地暴露和揭發官僚們的卑鄙與無恥。明顯地指出女人們的人生折學，更顯明地指出了有錢的公子哥兒們的酒醉色迷準備做牡丹花下鬼。它也說出了土豪劣紳的橫行不法，和老百姓們的屢遭欺侮。這劇在意義上是校極地揭露各階層的黑暗；在形式上也盡了它使觀衆笑的目的。</p>
<p>在劇中穿插兩塲舊劇裏的東西，在這裏于並不顯得刺目，反而覺得有力。如：齊大將軍拿刀上臺的一塲，竟使我聯想到這假冒將軍的騙子到底是假冒的，連做官的這一套架子也擺不像。同時也使我想到做官只不過是做戲而已！</p>
<p>這劇的編導有一點是該負責的，就是：笑的成份，前兩塲比後幾塲重，因而使人感到頭重脚輕。也許是導演者沒有把前面的笑的成份减輕，也沒有把後面的特別加重。所以才使人有這種感覺。否則的話，觀衆會更滿意地走出劇塲。</p>
<p>導演使演員走動地位而變成的畫面，介紹塲上主要演員很明顯。他已經做到了：假使突然有一個觀衆從外面走進劇塲，看到舞台上的畫面，就可以知道該看台上的那個人了。</p>
<p>演員都很好，他們都能保持笑劇的輕快的速度。只有演韓愈的那位，說話的聲調被拖長，走路和動作的沉重和遲緩，產生了不是笑劇所該有的氣氛。所以破壞了這劇的情調！這該由導演和演員共同負責，</p>
<p>最後出現的四個字：「豈無此理」；是作者寫完戲之後，怕人說他荒唐，故意來這一下驚人之筆，使觀衆有一個反想的機會。同時，也吿訴了觀衆，「眞有這麼一回事的，不要把它當作一個笑劇看，並不是笑笑就完事的戲！」</p>
<h3 id="c166">天國春秋的導演 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 名心</p>
<p>天國春秋紀錄下民族鬥爭中的一段史實，僅管歷史劇不一定就完全符合歷史，但一個重要的使命是決不可歪曲歷史。太平天國的覆亡，理由固然很多，但是楊秀淸的剛愎，韋昌輝的陰險，洪秀全的猜忌，這種能由於假人出發而埋下的因子，證之數千年來歷代興亡，固執於小我的成見以致斷送了國家民族的前途例子，那末「天國春秋」這個脚本，的確完成了它的忠於史實的任務。</p>
<p>可是，一般的看起來，舞台上的「天國春秋」，正面寫楊韋之爭不多，而洪宣嬌與傳善祥這一個三角戀愛的關係反而突出。但作者曾發表渦談話，申述他寫這個劇本的時間，正是對日戰爭節節失利的時候。時間與空間的限制，可能給作者許多的拘束。而今天搬上上海的舞台，儘管不及重新修改原作，透渦導演的剪裁，觀衆或者可以獲得一個較劇本所給的印象略有不同。</p>
<p>導演處理洪傳兩個人物，他認爲洪官嬌先天的有許多弱點。她愛楊秀淸但是她不可能再嫁給楊秀淸，因此她恨得寵的傅善祥，恨不得除掉她才甘心。她是天王的妹妹，帶過兵，打過仗！一舉劍之勞，在她是輕而易舉的。痛苦是，她有許多的內在的矛盾，偏偏陰謀鬼計的韋昌輝利用了她的矛盾，結果她變成　動地受了韋的利用，替韋昌祥做了帮兇，殺掉楊秀淸，爲了「得」反而「失」，這常她神志淸醒的時候，無論如何也受不了這個打擊，第六幕的懺悔之所以令人同情，種因也在此。</p>
<p>至於傳善祥，某些方面看來，却也是一個有見識有魄力的女子，她參加天國考試中了女狀元，她的雄心未始不想借此爲民族革命做一點光輝的事業，機會使她接近了東王，她的才幹成了楊秀淸的支柱，她非常了解洪宣嬌加給她的敵意，爲了國家前途，她確實想犧牲自己換回大局，如果不是有男氣，有遠見的女子，她決不敢跑到洪宣嬌面前冒死陳辭的。</p>
<p>因此舞台上的濱出，導演的企圖是很明顯的。洪宣嬌剛中有柔，傳善祥柔中見　，她們的衝突雖然多，而不至給人一個完全爭風吃醋的印象。這裏看出導演的苦心，是値得稱道，値得介紹的。</p>
<p>可惜歷史的應劇永遠搬演不完，在遍地烽火中來看天國春秋的演出，觀衆們爲歷史上的失敗英雄扼惋不已的時候，也不禁爲這時代的悲劇嘆息吧。</p>

<p>上海市立實騐戲劇學校學生組織了「業餘戲劇演出服務團」，以純義務的精神來協助學校劇團及業餘劇團的演出。服務之工作範圍暫定：佈景，燈光，效果，化裝，美工等五項。在他們的成立宣言裏，有這樣幾句誠懇的話：「歷來各學校及業餘劇團，往往因爲種種關係，致使演出的技術方面：如舞台裝置，燈光，效果，服裝，化粧，以及宣傳等等的工作，難於獲致預計的效果。爲補救這個缺憾起見，我們產生了這樣一個服務團的組織，願以純義務的精神相互研討學習以求進步的志趣來帮助完成這件艱巨的工作。</p>
<p>我們是愛好戲劇藝術的靑年，也是正在學習戲劇藝術的靑年。我們不會談高深的理論，也不願空口說白話；我們只是脚踏實地，實事求是地幹了，我們願意竭盡我們的能力來盡我們應盡的責任。」</p>

<p>— 江島</p>
<p>在「鶯飛人間」中演莉莉的女童星于復瑛，即將在「衣錦榮歸」中出現。她今年才只八歲，是河北保定人，在樂華小學讀三年級的課，天資聰敏，伶俐活潑，天眞可愛。她小小年紀在鏡頭前已經懂得演戲了，這次在「鷥飛人間」中，柳鶯初次來任雲家，她在柳鶯臨走時，抓一把花生塞進柳鷥的口袋，最逼眞！一點不呌人感到她在做戲，或是小孩子害躁的情形。其次，聽無綫電不肯走，給父親喊出去時，對劉琪的吿別，聲音裏充滿了不願意的情緒，也是很眞實的，一點不顯得價或是假作的樣子。她在「衣錦榮歸」中演林玲，據說鏡頭要比「鶯飛人間」多，這是一個很好的機會，作爲多給她一個練習，使她可以步陳娟娟的後塵。</p>
<p>在「鶯飛人間」裏，除了于復瑛外，也還有幾個很可造就的童星，如：被釘子在汽車輸胎下的水星，在鏡頭前，並不失掉他孩子的天眞，眞是難能可貴！</p>
<p>在「忠義之家」和「鷥飛人間」這兩個片子裏，大演員的演技成績不一定能勝過這帮童星呢！（圖即于復瑛）</p>
<h3 id="c169">天國春秋中的人物 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 易望</p>
<p>「天國春秋」是描寫太平天國內鬨的故事，雖然這裏面的大小情節都與天王洪秀全，寞王石達開有關，但是他們兩個始終沒有出塲，出場的只是東王楊秀淸，北王韋昌輝，西王妃洪宣嬌，女狀元傳善祥，國男賴漢英，漢奸張廷垣幾個重要的人物，在這幾個人物的相互交錯矛盾之中，而形成了一幕慘烈的歷更悲劇。</p>
<p>東王楊秀淸，天國的軍政大硬集中於他的一身他英明果斷，並且大公無私，他的才能得之於閱歷經騐較之於書本修養爲多，因爲他英　　　　所以能聽任向榮　困天都南京達數月之久，而內中調兵遣將，鞏固長江上游，廓淸大江南北，而終於解決向榮的數十萬大兵？他大公無私，因此他不但嚴於責僚屬，即對他所提携起來的弟兄北王韋昌輝，因爲他的貽誤軍情而痛責數十大棍，因此他對傳善祥的誹謗天王也一樣嚴厲地詰責，當然，他也知道這是他人別有用心的誣吿，所以他又不忍見傅善祥的哭訴。因爲他閱歷經騐豐富，所以他作事用兵有條有理，因爲他知道自己「墨水喝得不多」所以才能重用女狀元傳善祥，以彌補他自身的欠缺，由於對她的信任而對她發生了愛情。他出身草莽，所以有着義氣，有着單純質棧的心腸，也所以受了韋昌輝表面柔順的蒙蔽而結果爲其所害。但他的被害大半還由於他性格的另一面：倔强自信，剛愎自用，驕傲自大，他不能權衡輕重，辨別眞僞，洞察內情，因此才遭受了道殺身的慘禍。</p>
<p>北王韋昌一輝，商賈出身，精於算計，魅於財色，北王府中有了內奸，他自己渾然無知，却一味上想覇佔丞相的寵人紅鸞，他表面能受委屈，能柔順服從，但確實是笑裏藏刀，暗施詭計，他施詭計，自己却從不出頭，他知道女人妬忌的本性，所以他挑撥洪宣嬌，借她的刀殺楊秀淸；同時他也會利用下屬，連向天王密吿楊秀淸謀反之意，這一個人只知「利」爲重，爭權奪利正是他出身的本色，而暗謀奸詐也正是他出身行當的培養，他是從不知有國家民族在先的。</p>
<p>西王妃洪宣嬌是個直率坦白的女人，多年不帶兵和寡居使她性情趨於乘僻，心地趨於狹窄，尤其，當她看到以前曾對她熱烈追求而今天却倒在傳善祥懷抱中的楊秀淸，她又怎能壓抑自己的因妬而恨，因恨而下毒手呢？更何况韋昌輝道一把有力的扇子在她旁邊不斷地煽惑，她的妬火因之愈形吒盛了，她迷糊了國家民族的利益，把狹小的私仇放在首位，因此她造下了無法挽回的大錯，然而，她是屬於善良的人，她有着善良的本性，最後，她終於悔改了，她進入了修道院。</p>
<p>傅善祥，是舊社會中才女的典型，在太平天國之中她像是鶴立鷄羣，她有才能，有學識，有見地，然而她也軟弱，她敬愛東王，一方面是激於國家民族的意識，一方面自己是英雄崇拜的心理，她是識得大體的，認識了局勢中緊急的危機，她能毅然向洪宣嬌，向東王進勸諫，然而又有什麼用呢？這兩個都是堅硬如鐵的人，更何况洪宣嬌正把她視作眼中釘，她的勸言怎會被他們接受？作者對傳善祥有着過分的偏愛，甚至把她寫成白　無暇，但我們相信，在她的身上是存在着若干知識份子的缺點的。</p>
<p>賴漢英的出現是有趣的，它是一個糊塗軍人典型的代表，天王要他殺誰他就殺誰，他本身一無信仰，一無見地，而張廷垣則是典型的漢奸，每一個細胞都中了滿淸舉人的毒液。</p>
<p>觀衆演出公司這次演這齣戲是頗有意義的，而演員的陣容——耿震的東王，石羽的北王，舒　紋的洪宣嬌，鳳子的傳善祥，張雁的賴漢英，許肯的張廷垣——是够得上稱做堅强的，而在歐陽子倩的導演之下，相信這次演出一定有完美的成就。</p>

<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>幻遊南海</p>
<p>天才的華爾狄斯耐，一個藝術上的魔術家，從「小飛象」到這張「幻游南海」，像片中唐老鴨打破的萬寳瓶，碎了，滿天飛，五顏六色，無限燦爛，令人眼花撩亂，他的彩筆更點開了夢幻之門，一寸一尺，移步換形，眞是錦繡洞天，可說嘆爲觀止。華爾狄斯奈的挖空心思和賣弄噱頭也到最高峯了；眞人和卡通人物的共舞，花團錦簇的美女唱歌，活無姬曼無在卡通背景裏，都證明眞人參入卡通這種試騐的成功。美的畫面不勝枚舉，赤霞滿天中白烏翱翔，紅花綠樹中的一列火車，葉瓣露珠擊開一湖漣漪，乳白色的林木婆娑起舞等：塊麗無比，全片剪接和節律供佳。</p>
<p>但是我們很替華爾狄斯耐擔憂，「小飛象」以至「幻遊南海」中加入了醇酒婦人，在歌亂舞，根本失去一切敎育意味，可見最在着手爭取成年的觀衆，它不再是兒童的卡通，而純然是繁華社會的恩物，其中心都從聲色上發展，以娛觀衆，因此也就和永久的人性愈　愈遠了，所創造的卡通人物走入定型，「幻遊南海」的三巨頭便都是囂張浮誇的壞種，只有介紹墨西哥時的數頁畫卷，和幾幅賀年片似的圖畫，是紛擾中唯一可以回味的靜謐，我就喜歡這些點了燭火找尋棲宿的墨西哥土民的臉。恰如我喜歡卡門，蒙麗娜的以天靨，還有那首正在流行的歌。</p>
<p>情火刦灰</p>
<p>導演和編劇使「男女之間」的狄安娜巴里摩亞成功，導演和編劇却使杜娜李德無大發揮。社娜有一種純眞的秀麗，至今猶記得「人類的喜劇」中透明雨傘後她的芳姿，我相信她有純樸的技藝，大導演卡潑拉最近看中了她，延其主演她戰後第一部偉構，可知其係驥才。其實「情火刦灰」的題材原來可以成爲一個美麗的故事，惜無迎貫的Tempo，缺乏諧和，後半部更爲庸俗，導演羅勃李奧納不能謝罪，除了拳鬥一塲和開端一小段外，其他均屬簡陋從事，配音攝影，未得好好的支配。旅舍一段汽車開出開進，三翻四覆，小情人合作跳權一幕，他不曾加以把握，發展一點親切的情摯，都是過失，一個以「歌舞大王齊格菲」「桃花恨」爲代表作的導演，自然不能出類拔萃，比之「同甘共苦」的維多茀里敏或「重逢有日」的威廉實台爾的確失色。却爾斯勞頓稱職，飾尼柏一角的李却卡遜是値得一提的小生。</p>
<p>金絲雀</p>
<p>「男女之間」以後又一張絕妙的喜劇，又是富貴女兒追求窮漢的題材，聰明的是借了避難而來的歐洲公主，女美男用睡衣等幾幕場面近似「合歡花」但僅僅是吊着的一張一張字牌，就比「合歡花」好了。諾曼卡洛斯納自兼　導二職，劇本和導演手法一樣的簡潔，輕鬆，明快，尤其是劇本對話的滑稽，到處引出自然的笑聲，「與女之間」的妙趣多數憑藉動作，過火之時便嫌做作，「金絲雀」全賴言詞幽默，而且不像鮑勃霍甫來去一套老　頭，飛午師的「生子不是全日工作」和公卞叔叔的「十一位兄弟」的妙論，還有公主與其叔叔Something　Something的配偶漫談，已够絕倒，做媒的總統迄未露險，結尾的突出，是　劇原理的奇巧運用，只是不該拉出警察，使人誤會，女主角　　薇地哈菲蘭和公主叔叔却爾斯柯本俱甚生動，奧麗薇宜有雲髮相襯兩頰，則美艷甚，反之便覺遜色，羅勃死敵士似水，「男女之間」更好，的克卡遜的　直氣派亦是只此一家別無分出。</p>

<h3 id="c172">諾貝爾文學獎金的得者赫塞 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>報載聯合社瑞典京城十四日電：「瑞典學術院宣布以文學獎金贈與瑞士作家海斯，海斯生於德國，現年六十九歲，以前爲神學家。」</p>
<p>按海斯即赫塞（Hermann　Hesse），生於一八七七年，今年適爲六十九歲。他是個恬靜，平和，富於瑞士精神的人物，善作小說，尤長於短篇。描寫情緒的變換，尤爲純潔清醒。對於環境內一切瑣細沉靜的事，尤能曲達旁通，惟妙惟肖。他喜歡追述兒時往事和日常細事。他的作品大都寫得很好。</p>
<p>他早年的代表作是長篇小說「卡門辛特」（Peter　Camenzind，1904）和「格爾特魯德」（Gertrud，　1910）。美國琉毓松（Luowig　Lewisohn）著「近代德國文學的精神」（The　Spirit　of　Modern　German　Literature）論這兩本書道：「赫塞是解說小說的大家。他的小說很少，很短，却是富於抒情氣息的。他最好的作品「卡門辛特」和「格爾特魯德」是用第一身稱寫的，充滿了德國西南部景色純樸可愛的親切的描寫。學生卡門辛特和「格爾特魯德」裏的音樂家　恩都是熱情的靈魂，充滿了對於人生的呼喊，「青春的花朶，以及這可愛的世界。」兩個人都失敗了，不能滿足他們的呼喊。卡門辛特爲了他對於同伴不能表現真誠的自我，　恩爲了他是一個跛子。所以兩本書的結果都帶着戰敗而退的調子。但這兩個人對於人生並不失望，就在他們的不滿足中間，升起了對於大自然的美麗和變化，趣味和熱情的讚美。在孤寂與失敗中，他們仍是人生的肯定着。」</p>
<p>「卡門辛特」是寫瑞典農家子漫遊失意之後，歸家竟得慰安之境。此外長篇名著還有「車輪下」（Unterm　Rad，1905），寫愁苦的學生初雖戰勝環境，終於自殺，不免做環境的犧牲者。又中篇小說「德米安」（Demian，1919）曾獲得　坦獎金（Fontanepreis），寫的是戰前青年的發展與時代影響，他的敘述天才至此方才大熟，這成爲赫氏最成功的不朽名著。「印度記」（Aus　Incien，1913）也寫的纏綿深沉。他的「克努寫普」（Knulp）是描寫細故閑情最精刻的小品。</p>
<p>他的短篇小說可說是粒粒珍珠，有下列各篇：「這邊」（Diesseits，1907）「鄰居」（Nachbar，1908）「繞道」（Umwege，1910）「小園」（Kleine　Garten，1919）「童話」（Marchen，1919）「克林索的最後的夏」（Klingsors　Letzler　Sommer，1920）。</p>
<p>還有一本「察剌圖斯特剌之複歸」（Zaratu　tras　Wiederkehr，1920）也是獻與青年的很好的作品。</p>
<p>本文兼取材于張傳普的「德國文學史大綱」以及余祥森的「德意志文學史」和「現代德國文學思潮」，僅此誌謝。</p>
<h3 id="c173">涸轍相逢且相濡　—寄懷「文藝談話會」— <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 施星火</p>
<p>在「春秋」欄中，不止一次地讀到關於「文藝談話會」的建議和消息，筆者僻處小城，無緣躬與盛會，一瞻前輩作家們的風采，以領取他們的教益；但對這意味深長的集會，真是嚮往之至。每次看到「春秋」一角刊出的小小請柬，恨不得立刻插翅飛到上海來一陪末座，可是在縮地無術的今天，這希望還只是希望而已，不知何日可以如願。不過，我有一點小小的意思，久想假筆提供出來，作爲對文藝談話會的一點最誠意的貢獻：</p>
<p>在這歷史上空前的多災多難的時代，作爲一個文人，所遭受到的困厄往往比一般人更多，這是由於他敏感，他倔強，他勇於與現實相搏鬥，而不願爲環境所屈服；他有着銳利的眼光，不僅明察過去，透視現在，而且更能瞻望未來，他有着一支爲正義與真理而服務的筆，絕不願寫一句欺昧良心的話，甚至不願寫一個違背理智的字。……！</p>
<p>由於這樣，他就像命定似地，在精神上和身體上都得不斷地忍受一般人所不能忍受的煎熬，甚至使你的生命也受到了威脅。</p>
<p>幸而還能免於斧鉞之災的文人，要是他不慣於向刀尖上去舐血吃的話，單單在　上的磨折也　　　的。</p>
<p>自古以來，總是說：「　　而後工」，其實這話時那些養尊無憂的人們編造出來騙人的，他們自己吃慣了山珍海味，却要別人餓起肚子來寫文章。</p>
<p>事實上，當作家們不得不把時間大量地浪費在柴米油鹽的奔走上，浪費在提水，洗衣，補襪，劈柴上，浪費在疾病，失眠與焦慮，恐懼上的今日，像樣作品的不能產生，原是必然的事。</p>
<p>文章的不值錢，原也不自今始，可是文章與麵包之間價格的懸殊，却可以說是以今爲甚，目前一般報刊的稿費還不過千字三五千元，實在不夠吃一頓荒飯，即使比較高的也不過千字萬元，跟戰前千字二元至五元的標準相比，還差的很遠。戰前靠稿費收入維持生活的作家，如果每月平均能寫二萬字的話，一家三口已可以免飢餒之虞，現在又怎麼樣呢？——何况生活的艱困更直接影響到作家們的情緒與工作效率，原來可以每月寫二萬字的人，爲了柴米油鹽的困擾，腦中沒有片刻的清靜，恐怕也得打一個折扣了。</p>
<p>這年頭兒，還緊握着筆管不肯放，頂着「作家」的空銜頭不願改行的人，還不是十足的傻子嗎？他們穿的吃的都那麼粗劣，以致社會上一般人都不把他們放在眼裏，他們的社會地位就跟着生活水準一道降低下去。</p>
<p>最近在某晚報上看到四幅連環漫畫，寫一個文人伏在木箱上埋頭寫作，妻子兒女在旁邊爲着飢寒而啼哭，接着文人病了，死了，他留下的一堆破破爛爛的書籍，終於被他的妻拿到舊書攤上去，換幾個錢來買大餅充飢。</p>
<p>這就是文人的命運，這就是二十世紀五十年代的中國文人的命運！</p>
<p>這命運難道真是冥冥中的造化所註定的嗎？這命運難道真的不能用人力來改造嗎？</p>
<p>多少人笑我們是傻瓜，是阿Q，我們自己却覺得心安理得，幾千年來多少曾經顯赫一時的英雄豪傑都同歸塵土，只有文人們筆下所創造出來的藝術品才千古常新。他們在當時也正遭受過不知多少困厄，可是任何困厄都不能使他們低頭，於是，他們的精神就隨着那永恒的作品而得到了永生，像荷馬，莎士比亞，拜倫，歌德，屠格涅夫，莫泊桑，像屈原，杜甫，李白，……他們不分國界，不分古今，永遠予人累以精神上的滋養與溫暖；人類的歷史中間，如果沒有這許多文學巨匠的輩出，這世界上的燦爛的文化之果又從何處產生？</p>
<p>處在涸轍之中，善良的向上的作家們之間的相濡相煦聲息相通，乃至熱情的交流，確是非常必要的事：只有集體的力量才能促使每一個構成分子勇於向上，勇於克服外界一切的誘惑；只有集體的力量才能解決個人的困難，才能促使出版界改變過去「紅燒作家肉」的作風，使作者們能夠得到應該的權益。</p>
<p>這種不拘形式的作家的集合，在各地都可以普遍彷行，因爲各地的作家們都有着相濡相煦，需要着　泳於多數人的情感之流裏，以磨錬自己，策勵自己。</p>
<p>記得丐尊先生曾經有過這樣一句詩，就是：「相濡以沫沫成海」；這也不是不可能的事，因爲江海原是有一點一滴的水所積成的，我們每個人都以一滴水自居，積得多了，不是也可以形成江海嗎？（三五，十一，十五，於菰城）</p>

<h3 id="c175">抽菸 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 路陽</p>
<p>十幾年前，當我才是十歲上下小孩子的時候，就已經掖上了小旱菸管和綢製繡花的菸袋，裝模作樣地做小老翁，老菸槍了。其實在那時，抽菸本身對我倒毫無興趣，所感絕大興趣的乃在抽菸時得態度；這態度娛樂着我，許久許久。</p>
<p>自幼我廝守在祖母的身邊：一日三餐她管着給我盛飯夾菜這些瑣事，夜裏又捱緊地睡在她床上，並且老糾纏她給我講故事聽。每當一個故事講到情節緊張的時候，她總暫時停頓下來，裝一袋旱菸抽。藍烟從枕旁吹過來，刺激我闔上兩眼，更逐漸籠罩上祖母與我底頭，故事也恍惚變得更離奇，更縹緲了。我愛祖母，久之我也愛上祖母的銀鑄旱菸管</p>
<p>我家的長工老王，青年時期是闖蕩關外，入深山密林採取人參的勇士。現在年事雖大，還手　二斤重的粗長鐵製菸管，菸嘴足有酒杯大。他常常指着這件傢伙，誇講好漢當年用以毆鬥的事蹟。每當晚霞染山，收拾畢田間工作，我必須伕在　背上候他數分鐘，守望他蹲在樹下大過菸　；從那毫毛簇生的鼻孔中噴出的烟霧，常使我生劍俠鏢客的遐想，因此我也益發嚮往於抽菸。</p>
<p>後來我死求活賴着廚娘趙媽，到底爲我縫好一口綢質绣花的小菸袋，並在市集上買了根小銅菸管，偷點祖母或老王底菸草，居然也吞雲吐霧起來了。</p>
<p>自從母親送我到城內上學後，書本和新的遊戲便替代了抽菸。一晃就是十幾年，十幾年與菸久違，恢復抽菸，這才是過去不久的事；並且現在抽的是香菸。烟管烟袋的時代已遠不可追了。</p>
<p>當我心緒煩躁，苦惱，失意或憤怒的時候，我抽菸；一枝接上一枝，同時孤獨地在小屋中兜圈子。</p>
<p>當我完遂了一樁心願，做好了一件工作，或經過短程的行旅歸來，仰臥床頭把身心的緊張與疲勞釋放的時候，我抽菸；並準備下一個開始。</p>
<p>當我坐近燈前構思爲文，上節已成，下一段在醞釀中的時候，我抽菸；精神會藉此舒暢，文思便也充沛。當良辰美景，碰到什麽賞心樂事的時候，我抽菸；興奮怒放的心花，便慢慢再合攏來。</p>
<p>當微風撫視窗前，月光洒落枕畔；或當暴風雨雪統制宇宙，我底靈魂被往事糾纏的時候，我抽菸；從一連串的烟雲繚繞中，我再度看到我底童年，舊夢，和初戀少女深情的眼睛。</p>
<p>我　着菸，益加堅定的走着戰鬥的路。</p>
<p>我噴射烟箭，悸痛着心房，讀完報告四弟噩耗的家書。</p>
<p>我死勁扔掉半截菸尾，祝福那生活在飢荒戰祸中的雙親。</p>
<p>我燃着一枝菸，揮手辭別了草原上的情人。</p>
<p>而今，我來在這罪惡的東方大都市，我將以烟火記載生命被刻劃上的烙印。</p>
<p>菸已深深楔入我底生命中，再也不是生命的娛樂品了。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這女子一進場，那亮晶晶地兩顆眼珠，只些微一閃，就知道　已把全場情形，盡行收在眼底；尤其呌人驚異的，連那坐在暗陬的鶴見，也沒有從她眼角中漏了出去；也許因爲地點的燈光較暗，她的眼光却在鶴見身上，多多停留了這麼百分之一二秒時間。這在留意的人心上，很容易覺察出來。</p>
<p>關於戒備，鶴見可用不着，別說僅僅這個女子一人，就呌她把剛才外面吊着綫的幾個傢伙，一齊領了過來，鶴見也不見得很難應付，因爲鶴見從他的工作目標而說，他的地位，就等於身處一座危山的危險頂巔上，無時無地不是戒備着的。此外，他還用着脫身事外的第三者態度，反而注意這女子一下。</p>
<p>話雖如此，而事實的進展上，却呌鶴見陡地吃了一驚：因那女子，在入口地方，稍稍停駐了一下，也就是短短的這麼五秒十秒鐘吧。短得　　把自己那種雍容華貴的風度，維持得恢復了原有的平衡，這才踏着優美而輕捷的步子，對準鶴見這裏，直走過來；而且在開頭第一步上，她早瞧着鶴見，微微地，光是一顰，緊接着嫣然一笑。</p>
<p>這個女子，這種動作，豈不有些過於突兀嗎？不然。這個動作，不僅毫不突兀，並且很有一個必須的道理，在這道理中，至少也有兩三重要緊的用意：頭一重用意，是給鶴見一個警告：「注意，我來了，請你要放自然些，免得場外人感覺我的動作突兀。」或是，「注意，你要放明白些，我是先禮後兵，你不能輕舉妄動，呌人看出你是一個毛頭小夥子，縱然你不準備接受我的突擊，你也得放安祥些。」再有一重關係，那是從「自己人」立場說話，雖然二人從未謀面，生張熟魏，各不相知，然而對這些　山其他各色秘字號人物眼下，切不能做出彼此不相識的楔子，呌他們詫異，因而注意。</p>
<p>這女子先顰後笑的警告，雖說呌鶴見有些驚異，倒不因她含有秘密性的關係，却是　覺上的敏感在作祟。對於這女子的豔麗，他雖不會動心，然而審美的意念是有的，否則何以有九十五分的品評呢？這一審美，當然免不了多注目了一下，何况因她含有秘密性，還在注意她的行動哩。有了這較長的注意，而过注意的目的物，突地向他直接進攻，當然要感覺到這是一個意外，好意惡意雖不可知，直覺上却不能不生出驚奇的敏感。</p>
<p>「驚動了，鶴見先生，像這樣的冒昧，真是失禮得很！」女子異常大方地，邊說邊伸出手來，完全模倣歐美的舉動，她說得一口純正的東京語調，聲音之美，真像一顆一顆珍珠，掉在玉盤中走動，那樣珠圓玉潤。開口說話的時候，含着一臉笑容，笑容上又泛起一層紅霞，真像一朶攻瑰，对着剛升的陽光，把花瓣尖子，微微張開了一些些似的。</p>
<p>鶴見這邊，早也從從容容，站了起來，紳士型地接住女子的手，微微點了點頭，含笑說，「哪裏，哪裏，我也正在希望玉駕的光臨哩！」說着，知道這女子有坐下的意思，便也按照西式禮節，替她挪開了椅子，侍候她坐下。一邊對那慢步挪移過來的侍者，稍稍點頭示意，一邊輕輕問着這位豔麗如花的不速之客，「小姐喜歡用點……？」</p>

<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>哈同遺產的爭奪戰</p>
<p>歐司愛·哈同——這位幸運的猶太人，上海人誰不知道他的名字？關於他一生「投機成功史」，從勘管垃圾的「馬路巡閱使」直到富甲全滬的地產鉅商，上海人也早已洞悉戶曉。他的財產有多少？哈同死時的估計，的値四百萬金鎊，這一筆鉅大的遺產，貽害無窮，弄得十五年來，糾纏不淸，東也奪，西也爭，烏烟瘴氣一團糟。</p>
<p>而最近，忽然又有十二個伊拉克人加入戰團，預備再興大訟，纏上一通：</p>
<p>說來話長</p>
<p>這筆遺產糾紛，眞也是說來話長。自從一九三一年六月，密司脫哈同丟下了他刻苦經營來的財產與老婆羅迦陵夫人撤手西歸以後，爲了子嗣問題，鬧得天翻地覆，接着一位哈同近親伊拉克人向羅迦陵爭奪遺產，具狀英國法院，要求依照伊拉克法律分析哈同的遺產。因爲依照伊拉克法律，近親是可分得四分之三的遺產的。</p>
<p>哈同是猶太人，生在伊拉克的倍克特地方，爲伊拉克籍。但是也有人說哈同已入恭國籍。究竟算是什麼「籍」？哈同生前旣並未「鄭重聲明」過，死後也無法證實。但是英政府貪圖這一筆鉅額的遺產說是事實，並且前滬工部局所行的政策，是取決於納稅人的投票，而票數的多少，又根據於不動產數額的多少，哈同的產業多，票權就多，掌握哈同的產榮，無異加强了對工部局的控制。因此英政府謂：哈同爲受英保護之人民，應受英法律節制、這位伊拉克人就此敗了訴。</p>
<p>於是，羅迦陵牢牢地掌握了哈同的遺產，整整的十年，臨死前的三年，她雙目失明了，但是握住遺產，仍不放手，她是中國人，中國在艱苦地抗戰，可是從沒有聽見她捐過半個大錢。說哈同是曾人過英籍的吧，英德開戰，也沒有有見她捐過英政府一個辨士。她情願化錢在幾個和尙的禿頭上，助長他們製造　聞秘屑而已。</p>
<p>金錢作怪</p>
<p>羅迦陵與哈同結　四十載，並無「一男半女」，却獨喜收義子義女，爲身後造下無數糾紛的種子。民初辨什麼「　聖明智大學」的時候，校裏的男女學生，被夫人看中的，就收在滕下，先後不下百餘人，只是夫人喜怒無常，義子義女中稍見不滿意，立即逐出。最後只剩義子九人，義女九人。</p>
<p>迦陵夫人一止想享享福，安度晚年，不想又有哈同近親子嗣十人，委託日籍律師岡本，要求分析法幣四萬三千七百萬元，還在報上登一則「警吿啓事」，不承認他人處分財產。接着哈同洋行總賬房姬覺彌在西摩路上被綁，不如意事，一再光臨，終於肺疾復發，「駕返瑤池」！</p>
<p>於先忙壞了愛　園中的義子，義弟，義女，義孫……，爭先恐後來料理喪事，報上鉅大的訃聞刋登出來，後面一長排名字，便是這些挺身而出不打自招的，覬　遺產者！</p>
<p>於是，把戲就不斷而來；起先，英領事館知照捕房，派員保護哈同產業。羅迦陵大殮時，哈同洋行的重要文卷，忽被「義弟」姬覺彌的保鑣秘密移動，而被工部局警員察覺，予以扣押，姬覺彌又事後聲稱係誤會。更爲「撲朔迷離」的，是遺囑竟發見了「雙包案」！</p>
<p>你搶我奪</p>
<p>哈同在臨終時立有遺囑：其中指明所有財產的百分之七十歸嗣子喬其哈同（無國籍）所有。但羅迦陵逝世時又發現了第二遺囑，內容大異，羅迦陵的嗣子喬治哈同承認第一遺囑，另一嗣子羅友蘭及其他華籍「不孝孤哀子女」等則堅決主張第二遺矚有效，多方角逐，攪個不休。而在報達的哈同親屬之代表，又來湊熱鬧，要求根據伊拉克法律，分析哈同遺產。</p>
<p>愛儷園中的人物，本來分爲三大系：一系以姬覺彌爲領袖，又一系爲列名訃吿的，「罪孽深重，不自殞滅」的人物，其中又分二派，一派即頻年常侍羅迦陵夫人左右者，另一派即曾失寵於夫人者，如一度被逐的喬其哈同等輩。「三角」料紛，本已熱鬧非凡，又添上十二個伊拉克人，湊成「四角」，更是令人「嘆爲觀止」。</p>
<p>勝利以後，紛爭十五年的未了公案，又死灰復燃起來，十二位伊拉克近裔，擬再度聘請律師，提出訴訟，結果如何，「且聽下回分解」。</p>
<p>總之，攪來攫去，爲的是「錢」。哈同生前，連零用都不捨得化費，掙得了「太多」的財產，而死後，竟鬧得身後天翻地復，不可開交。世之守財奴，亦可以憬然醒悟矣！</p>

<p>— 馬葉</p>
<p>上月三十日各報有一條電報上說東北正擬用「大豆製造羊毛」，筆者曾在欄提出疑問，認爲大豆製造的是「人造羊毛」即「人造短纖維」，「人造」兩字脫不得，正如「人迭絲」之有別於天然蠶絲。</p>
<p>領九日經過了翻譯的合衆社七日紐約電，知道科學家已「發現人造盤尼西林之方法，能製造新型盤尼西林……」筆者手頭沒有方法找到原來電文參照，但以常識推論，今次的「人迭」，似亦有推敲的餘地。</p>
<p>大家都知這，盤尼西林係「提鍊」目靑徽菌的培養液，至目前爲止，在藥房賣的「盤尼西林」的「靑徽素」，不過像田糞缸中挑出的姐虫封在瓶裏賣。蛆虫亦係上帝「製造」，不是「人造」。</p>
<p>大概目去年起，許多科學家已埋頭於化學實驗室，企圖以人工合成的化學方法來直接「製造」靑黴素。今年夏季，記得在什麼英文的科學雜誌上看到、說某科學家已發見了用人工合成的（Synthetic）方法製造靑徽素的端倪，假如成功，「盤尼西林」就可以不用培養液培養，而由培養液提取，售價定必大减。</p>
<p>七日這條電報原文假如是說「人工合成的」製迭法成功，那末，我們的譯電似乎不應該省下「合成的」這個詞兒。假如不是，原意不過說有個新方法來培養或提取的呢，那末，「人造」一詞似乎亦欠妥當。因爲人工合成的盤尼西林假如眞已研究成功，它將必列爲本年度大發明之一項</p>
<p>帶着牛肉的牛皮是天然牛皮，經過製革過程製成以供皮鞋用的不過是「皮革加工」，祗有像德國從前用紙漿，可塑體，和硬性的塡充物等等混合與化合，再經高壓力製造而成的似皮非皮的「人造皮」，才是眞正的「人造」。</p>
<p>另外一個例：兩性荷爾蒙製劑從前是提鍊目姙婦尿，動物卵巢和動物睪丸，但新式「人工合成的」即「人造」荷爾蒙，則由化學家在試管裏「合成」而成。兩者都在市場上賣着。</p>
<p>「合成化學」是近代化學的寵兒，最初，化學家像魔術師地由「無機的」藥品，在試管裏合成了「有機的」尿素。這是近代化學史上一件大事。</p>
<p>我希望，我以上猜的是錯。萬一眞是「愚者千慮」，那我祗想再度提出上决短文結尾的建議，新聞記者應該分工了。不是說笑而是親見的事：一位能够洋洋洒洒翻譯邱吉爾演講詞的譯電者，却把「潛艇基地」譯爲「海底據點」了！</p>

<p>— 克榮</p>
<p>從美國人眼裏看　國人，「揩油」幾爲一般的現象，下面有這樣一段　刺的記載：</p>
<p>「中國人喜歡揩油，替朋友買東西，至少要抽百分之十的佣金。」</p>
<p>電車售票員的「揩油」，已是司空見慣，不足爲奇！</p>
<p>記得監守自盜的金磚案，也曾轟動一時，說那主人翁花天酒地，如何享樂，在他不過一念之差，想挪用了再說，誰願意甘蹈法網？其實說他是「揩油」。也未嘗不可。</p>
<p>最近行總高級職員吳燧人擅將聯總匯款二十七億元，私放高利貸。我不是替那傢伙做義務律師，原則上這二十七億元關在鐵箱裏，太沒有意思了，何不拿來流動運用，以百分之二十的高利貸放出，每月憑添五千四百萬元的收入，何樂不爲？在中國　型計算器敵不過一把中國古老的舊算盤的現階段，我不能不讚美中國的算盤！</p>
<p>我把上面重大舞弊的案件，說成了輕描淡寫的「楷油」。「舞弊」可以說是「揩油」，那末「揩油」何嘗不可說是「舞弊」，不過「揩油」的事小，「舞弊」的事大，「揩油「與「舞弊」五十步和百步之比，所犯的錯誤是沒有爾樣。</p>
<p>雅好「揩油」的中國特殊民族性，希望以後不要上行下效，循循相因，官長揩士兵的油，官吏揩百姓的油，應該澈頭澈尾剷除這個劣根性，不然的話，我眞不忍說了！</p>

<p>朋友：</p>
<p>親愛的，我有一件很好玩的而又不大不小的事兒要吿訴你，你要聽嗎？</p>
<p>首先，我得問你二句話；第一句，你家裏很有些財產嗎？弟二句，你有沒有至親至戚在當什麼長，什麼主任嗎？如果你旣沒有多大的財產，又沒有什麼長什麼主任的親戚，我想，我所要吿訴你的話，你一定贊成。</p>
<p>我要吿訴你的，就是我曾吶喊過二次的「提倡職業保險」我們是說行就行的人，「職業保險」的工作，已經開始實行了，我們十多個有的是熟悉的有的還是初交的朋友，每月節省下以生活指數計算的二塊錢來，準備把它存入信用卓著的銀行裏生息，我們十多個朋友中，如有人失業了，我們就立刻替他介紹職業，可以救濟他及他一家人的生活，祗是我們現在的根基太脆弱了，未曾盡過美務的朋友，祗妊暫緩救濟，如果我們的新朋友一天天多了，我們的儲蓄也一天天多了的話，我們除了原定的介紹與救濟工作外，我們還要辦一個合作社，生產，信用，消費，建築都合在一起的混合合作社，用自已的款項，建築房子，供自已的朋友住，用自已的款項，辦理小規模的工廠和農塲，供給眞正無法介紹職業的朋友工作，用自己的款項，辦理信用，供自己的朋友週轉，用自己的款項，辦理消費合作，以减少商人們的剝削。</p>
<p>朋友，你相信嗎，我的話？</p>
<p>朋友，你聽過「亞美利加的幼童」的兵艦的故事嗎？如果你相信那故事。那你一定相信我的話。</p>

<p>— 尤光</p>
<p>關於「職業保險」，在先進國家，殆已普遍實施，在蘇聯稱做「社會保險」，這種事業是中國家主辦的，去年蘇聯政府爲了推行這個事業，他們的預算達到一千一百億盧布，在第四個五年計劃裏，爲了「社會保險」，曾預計支出六千一百六十億盧布，道個事業在社會主義國家中，也是如此重視，但資本主義國家，如美國，英國，政府也在極力提倡。</p>
<p>「職業保險」顧名思義是對你我的職業一種的保障，但這不是對你我現前職業的保障，而是說，對你我將來不怕失業的一種保障。換言之，在我或你將來失業的時候，是可以得到一種職業的，然而，這需要大家預先有一個共同合作基礎才行。</p>
<p>我們首先要廣求同志，開始先由有職業的起來參加組織，然後再推進到沒有職業的人們中去，使他們也來參加合作。</p>
<p>比仿說，我們成立一個××職業保險公司，徵求會員，每個會員加入這個合作公司以後，他就是公司的一個股東或者是價權人，他們就能得到應有的權利和保障。</p>
<p>例如，現在你要來參加這個組織做個會員，你先應當忠誠的塡好給你的各種表格，它是調查你的技能，職業興趣，家庭狀况，每月收支情形，因爲將來在你一旦失業而需要救濟的時候，公司是按照你所塡的表格而予以救濟或替你介紹適當的工作的，所以當你塡表時，你不應一誇大或掩飾，公司對你將來的需要和介紹職業，旣有如此重大的責任，那末你就要按照公司所指定的每人每月收入百分之幾，每月繳送公司來，公司先將這些款子，集中起來，作爲基金，這是會員的義務。</p>
<p>會員盡了他應有的義務之後，將來他就能亨到以下的權利；</p>
<p>你一且失業，公司馬上就會爲你解決工作問題，或者確保你的生活。</p>
<p>公司把會員所繳交會費，全部存貯銀行，假使這個公司有二萬會員，每人平均每月要繳交二萬元，全部那有四萬萬收入，一年後，就有四十八萬萬元了，利息尙未計入。</p>
<p>公司將這筆栽子來幹許多有益社會的生產事業。例如設立供應平價物品商店（不是官定平價，要眞是沒有純利的平價），興辦學校，建設住宅區，創辦農塲等等。</p>
<p>以上所說，梗概而已，要幹的話，我們還得好好詳細的計劃。只要大家都有積極心理，這一建　，並不是說說罷了的！</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Social Democratic Party deliberated all day on the 23rd, discussing the list of representatives to attend the National Assembly, finally concluding at 5:00 PM. Zhang Junmai then submitted the list to Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The list includes a total of forty names (corresponding to the number decided by the PCC). When the National Government Selection Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd, the list was approved in principle. The National Government promulgated it by decree in the evening, and registration and attendance at the conference can begin on the 24th. Furthermore, Xu Chuanlin and Li Daming have been decided upon as the party's candidates for the presidium. However, Xu has indicated that he will decline if elected to the presidium. The list of the party's representatives is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Daming, Li Shengce, Chen Yisheng, Huang Boying, Hong Shaozhi, Tan Wochu, Yu Yian, Yang Junming, Huang Bocheng, Zhong Gongmin, Wu Zaochi, Zhang Yingnan, Shi Zhiquan, Luo Jingxuan, Wang Zihai, Mao Liyu, An Kongzheng, Zhang Junding, Zhang Liebang, Luo Sifo, Liao Jingcun, Cen Youchang, Yang Yuzi, Kuai Chao, Yang Guangyang, Sun Yafu, Zhu Hongru, Jin Houcheng, Zhu Songshou, Xiang Goufu, Dai Ziliang, Deng Tianshi, Li Junfu, Cheng Wenxi, Zhou Shusheng, Jiang Yuntian, Tan Jiahua, Liu Zhongyi, Wang Shiming, Zhang Zhongyou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Hu Haimen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party, flew from Nanjing back to Beiping at 1:00 PM on the 23rd. Reporters visited Hu at his private residence. According to Hu, the Social Democratic Party headquarters had almost completely decided on the matter of participating in the National Assembly. When he took the opinions of some party members in the north to Shanghai and then to Nanjing to meet with Zhang Junmai, Chairman Chiang's two-page reply had already arrived. Under these circumstances, everything seemed unchangeable. Before returning to Beiping, Mr. Junmai greatly hoped that the comrades in the north could understand his decision, and stated that he personally would not participate in the National Assembly. When asked by reporters whether the Social Democratic Party would split as a result, Hu did not answer. After Hu returned to Beiping and got off the plane, he first exchanged views with Qiu Shui and others. He will also meet with Zhang Dongsun within a few days. Whether some party members in the north will again express their attitude towards the National Assembly or take action remains to be decided after consultation with Zhang and others.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The plenary meeting of the Beiping branch of the Social Democratic Party was held at Tang Xiangming's residence last night and did not end until late at night. As a result, Ji Yiqiao was appointed to report to Nanjing, and at the same time requested an increase in the list of National Assembly representatives for the Minming and recommended candidates for National Assembly representatives to the headquarters for approval. According to party insiders who hinted to reporters, the list of candidates for Ping was telegraphed to the headquarters last night. Today, the Social Democratic Party will submit the list of National Assembly representatives to Chairman Chiang. It was also reported that Tianjin held a meeting at the same time and appointed Wei Jiqing to report to Nanjing on party affairs and recommend candidates for National Assembly representatives.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Zhang Junmai's Letter to the Chairman <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The letter from the Social Democratic Party, signed by Zhang Junmai, to the Chairman, and the Chairman's reply, were officially exchanged on the 23rd. Xu Fulin of the Social Democratic Party announced it at 9:00 PM. The contents of the letter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Zhang Junmai:</p>
<p>Respected Chairman Jieshi: Since participating in the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year, what I have been thinking about is peaceful unification, integrating the various parties in the country into the National Assembly, and formulating a constitution that the whole country abides by. What you, sir, are seeking is no different from this. Who would have thought that things would go awry? The initial union of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the PCC would ultimately diverge because the date for the National Assembly could not be agreed upon. I, Junmai, strongly advocated postponing the opening by fifteen days to allow for broader consultations, but I was unable to obtain the understanding of all parties. As a result, the hearts of those who seek peace are filled with anxiety. Many suspect that there will be no day for peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and although the ceasefire order has been issued, the people still fear that they will not escape the suffering of war. Although the National Assembly can be convened, the constitution that is formulated may be difficult to abide by jointly. The representatives of the PCC will also be divided into two. If these doubts become reality, the country will be in a state of irreversible calamity. However, I, Junmai, believe that although the situation is dangerous, there is still hope for reversal, which lies in your Excellency's careful planning and first exhausting what is within my power: (1) How to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order to prevent the expansion of the war and sincerely strive for the utmost sincerity of peace; (2) How to thoroughly implement the spirit of the PCC resolutions to demonstrate to the people of the country the determination to implement democracy.</p>
<p>Thorough implementation of the ceasefire order requires:</p>
<p>First, the Military Mediation Executive Department presided over by the Three-Person Committee should continue to work actively to avoid the expansion of conflicts and reserve room for the resumption of peace talks.</p>
<p>Second, in accordance with the troop reorganization plan, the government should seek its realization with the greatest forbearance.</p>
<p>Third, the government's repeated statements of resolving political disputes through political means should remain firm and unchanged, so that true peace can be achieved, finances can be reorganized, and national strength can be consolidated.</p>
<p>Thorough implementation of the PCC resolutions requires:</p>
<p>First, the draft constitution revised by the PCC Constitutional Drafting Committee should be passed within the National Assembly, and all parties should be responsible for ensuring its passage.</p>
<p>Second, effectively protect the people's freedom of person, speech, association, and academic freedom, so that the people can freely express the depression in their hearts, and the government can thus know the direction of the people's hearts and be warned.</p>
<p>Third, since the government is determined to implement constitutionalism, it should automatically end party rule at an early date. The following points should be implemented first:</p>
<p>(1) After the constitution is promulgated, the expenses of party departments at all levels should cease to be paid from the national treasury.</p>
<p>(2) After the government is reorganized, the central government already has the National Government Committee as the decision-making body. The administration of provinces, cities, and counties should be the responsibility of the provincial, city, and county governments, and local party departments should not interfere.</p>
<p>(3) Schools are places for cultivating citizens and talents. If young students are allowed to participate in party political work, it will only cause disputes. The government should, based on the way of cultivating talents for the country, clearly stipulate measures to eliminate the suspicion of party-dominated education.</p>
<p>If the government can earnestly implement all of these points, it will naturally cause the people to understand the determination to move towards democracy and create a harmonious atmosphere in the country, which will be of great help to the restoration of peace talks.</p>
<p>Fourth, the reorganization of the government and the cooperation of various parties aims to refresh politics and should be based on the principle of employing people based on their merits, bringing a fresh look to the world. Since the PCC, it seems that the various parties have been arguing over the number of seats in the National Government and the responsibilities of the ministries of the Executive Yuan. However, in essence, what is urgently needed is the renewal of the entire spirit of the administration and the talent regardless of boundaries. If people of Kuomintang nationality control or check each other in various ways in the reorganized government, the administrative organs will become more and more disintegrated and unable to operate. I, Junmai, have already participated in the review work in advance after the PCC, and I am willing to complete the review work. If the draft constitution can be based on the PCC's resolutions, and at the same time the government can anticipate it, and automatically express the end of party rule at an early date, while thoroughly implementing the ceasefire order, and thoroughly implementing the spirit of the PCC resolutions, then the comrades of the Democratic Socialist Party, although deeply regretful that the various parties cannot gather together, will naturally attend on this day of returning power to the people to support the completion of the great law. There is no shortage of people in the country who doubt the effectiveness of the actual implementation of this soon-to-be-completed constitution, but I, Junmai, dare not speculate and stay out of the review. The success or failure of the great cause of nation-building in the future is closely tied to this, and the direction of the people's hearts throughout the country also depends on the effectiveness of the implementation of the constitution. Please consider carefully, and I await your clear instruction. Sincerely, Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Organization Committee of the China Democratic Socialist Party. November 20, 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chen Lifu Talks Freely About Constitution-Making and Peace Talks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department, met with reporters on the 23rd and spoke freely about the issue of constitution-making, believing that the five-power system is most suitable for our national conditions. Regarding the issue of peace talks, he believes that when the time is right, reopening is still possible, but the Communist Party's hesitation on peace talks will only cause suffering to the people.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chairman's Reply to Zhang Junmai <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reply from President Chiang:</p>
<p>Respected Mr. Junmai:</p>
<p>I have received your letter of November 20th, and I am deeply moved by your loyalty to the country and your concern for the government's aspirations. The purpose of convening the National Assembly this time is to fulfill the lifelong struggle of the National Father and to realize the government's long-cherished wish to end tutelage and return power to the people. This is known to all Chinese people and must be supported by you, sir. I am very pleased to hear that your party intends to participate immediately. The points indicated in the letter have either been handled by the government or are being implemented by the government. They are all insightful and coincide with the government's ideas. Regarding the issue of the Chinese Communist Party, the government has always been determined to find a solution through political methods. This ceasefire order must be thoroughly implemented, the executive group should continue to be effective, and the troop reorganization plan should be realized in order to achieve the goal of nationalization of the army. Since the PCC draft constitution has been agreed upon, all parties should be responsible for finding ways to pass it. The government has promulgated and implemented measures to protect the people's freedom, and should strive to implement them one by one in the future.</p>
<p>As for the end of party rule mentioned in the letter, our party has already made a decision and is gradually implementing it. After the constitution is promulgated, it should be completed as soon as possible, as stated in the letter.</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the government, we must concentrate talents from all parties and improve administrative efficiency in political issues so that the work of nation-building can be promoted rapidly. In short, the points listed in the letter are what the government should do and what Zhongzheng personally wants to do his best to achieve. You, sir, have always advocated the early implementation of constitutionalism. This convocation of the National Assembly is to formulate a constitution so that our party can end party rule and return power to the people, which is also what you, sir, desire. Therefore, I hope that members of your party will attend this National Assembly and jointly participate in the constitution-making work so that constitutionalism can be implemented at an early date.

<h3 id="e13">Marshall and Stuart Are Willing to Make a Trip to Yan'an to Seek Peace in Our Country; the Communist Party's Attitude Can Be Decided Within a Week <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] It was learned from reliable sources this morning that the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Yan'an will decide within a week whether the Communist Party will accept the government's peace plan or retreat into a small area in western China to conduct a protracted war. At the same time, the future fate of General Marshall, the mediator in China, is also in the hands of Yan'an. It is expected that Yan'an will issue a statement in the next few days clarifying whether the US President's special envoy is still acceptable to the Communist Party. If the Communist Party Central Committee hopes so, it is believed that General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart will be willing to fly to Yan'an to seek a peaceful solution. At the same time, Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party's peace talks, is reporting to the Communist Party Central Committee on the Nanjing negotiations, deciding whether the Communist Party will maintain its recent tough attitude and refuse Chairman Chiang's ceasefire proposal, or whether they are willing to achieve readily available peace. A senior government official told a United Press reporter today that if the Communist Party can also issue a ceasefire order and reconvene the Three-Person Committee to determine the permanent allocation of military districts, then the civil war "can be ended almost immediately." If the Communist Party does not accept the peace proposal, the government will regard the Communist Party's attitude as open rebellion against the government. He said that Chairman Chiang's attitude seems to have been greatly eased, because in terms of amendments to the draft constitution and the reorganization of the government, he has adhered to the principles set at the conference of various parties in January. However, the Communist Party has refused to retreat a step, and said that this ability of the Communist Party may only be a political posture, but in the National Assembly and the soon-to-be-reorganized National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, positions are reserved for the Communist Party, waiting for them to take their seats, which is a fact.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 22nd] Personnel from the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (PRRA) are currently proposing to take strict measures against a large number of Chinese merchants here, potentially deporting them. These measures are related to the sugar storage case currently under consideration by Malacañang Palace. It is reported that the PRRA has sealed 24,550 bags of refined sugar, of which more than 18,000 bags are stored in the warehouses of import companies because the PRRA's warehouses cannot accommodate them. Of these 18,000 bags, thousands belong to Chinese importers, who, under the orders of the Philippine government, inventoried all the stored sugar as "goods of the import companies" and stored them in their own warehouses. People from Malacañang Palace report that Chinese merchants began selling them on the market. The PRRA received instructions and immediately dispatched search teams to suspected shops, discovering more than 4,000 bags. It is said that Chinese merchants disposed of 4,444 bags of sugar without the permission of the Philippine government, accounting for 18 percent of the stored sugar in the import companies. Our merchants are currently seeking legal remedies, as the law stipulates that the government's price limit for sugar is one peso per kilogram. If merchants can provide receipts proving that they paid 1.21 pesos per kilogram of sugar, they can receive fair compensation. Our legation recently accepted the suggestion of Philippine Presidential Secretary Abello, submitting a memorandum to the Philippine government regarding the overall confiscation situation and protesting the high-handed measures taken during the confiscation.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chengdu Municipal Government previously negotiated with two American companies, through the introduction of the Sino-American Industrial Company, on the problem of Sino-American cooperation in constructing six major projects in Chengdu, including electric lights, running water, public buses, and sewers. It is now learned that the negotiations have reached a concrete result. Representatives of both sides have signed the cooperation principles, but the scale of the project and the amount of funding are being requested from the provincial and central governments by the municipal government. It is generally estimated that the total cost will be more than 10 billion yuan in national currency, and the time required will be at least two years. The materials and services provided by the U.S. side will be treated as loans and not as investments.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Xu Pucheng, commander of the puppet 2nd Army, was fortunate enough to be pardoned by the authorities after the victory, and has been living freely ever since. He has now been accused by Zhang Shaohua, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, to the local authorities for killing patriots. The reason being that in 1944, Zhang dispatched his subordinates Wang Guojun and eight others to Changzhou to carry out underground work. Xu discovered this, and his troops cruelly murdered them one by one. There is no greater injustice in the world than this. The families have been filled with anger ever since, and all they want is to take revenge.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Ten Legislators Discuss Revising the Draft Constitution (II) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>One of the main differences between the revised draft and the original draft is that the original draft stipulated the rights and obligations of the people as follows: "The people have ×× freedom, which shall not be restricted except by law." The revised draft changed this to "The people have ×× freedom," and removed "which shall not be restricted except by law." This is a modification based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). (The PCC made the following provisions regarding the rights and obligations of the people: (1) All freedoms and interests that democratic people should enjoy shall be protected by the Constitution and shall not be illegally infringed; (2) If there are legal provisions regarding the freedoms of the people, they must be based on the spirit of protecting freedom, and not for the purpose of restriction.)</p>
<p>Wang Xianhui, the drafter of the revised draft, stated when he attended the Legislative Yuan on the 13th of this month to explain the collation process: The revised draft and the original draft have the same purpose, only differing in starting points. The legislators were quite satisfied with this and considered it a progressive provision. Mr. Chen Guyuan believes that the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution were too trivial. He also questioned whether the people's freedom of belief should be included in the Constitution, as the constitutions of various countries do not have such provisions. He believes that the freedoms listed in the revised draft are inherent human rights, but they are not without restrictions. For example, Article 23 stipulates: "All other freedoms and rights of the people that do not harm social order or public interests shall be protected by the Constitution," providing the people with active protection. Zhong Tianxin also believes that the revised draft is superior to the original draft.</p>
<p>The only person who believed that this article was inferior to the original draft was Fu Tongxian. Mr. Fu is a logician who expressed his unique views at the Legislative Yuan’s discussion meeting with a non-partisan and non-factional point of view. Mr. Fu believes that the original draft Constitution does not imply "legal restrictions." The first sentence, "The people have ×× freedom," is active, and its object is the people. The Constitution grants the people the protection of freedom based on this sentence. The second sentence, "which shall not be restricted except by law," is passive, and its object is the government. The Constitution binds the government based on this sentence. This provision is actually superior to the revised draft.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu further explained based on logic, saying: "which shall not be restricted except by law" does not equal "which may be restricted by law." He gave the example: "If it is not restricted according to law, then it cannot be restricted," which can be changed to "If this flower has no color, it is definitely not red." These two statements commit the error of "conversion" (a logical fallacy) in logic by negating the subject. The error of those who generally believe that the original May 5th Constitution contains legal restrictions lies in this. At the same time, if the law referred to in "which shall not be restricted except by law" violates the constitutional principle of protecting the rights of the people, this law cannot restrict the freedom of the people. In other words, even if the government restricts the freedom of the people, it must be within the scope of the Constitution, so there seems to be no need to worry. However, can a law that conforms to the Constitution restrict individual freedom? Mr. Fu believes that since the Constitution was formulated by the representatives of the people, that is, formulated by the people themselves, it can restrict the freedom of the people.</p>
<p>The Organization and Powers of the National Assembly</p>
<p>Regarding the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the revised draft differs significantly from the May 5th Draft Constitution. Due to this difference, the relationship between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan also differs greatly. According to the May 5th Draft Constitution, the National Assembly representatives were directly elected by the counties and cities, Mongolia, Tibet, and Overseas Chinese. The revised draft adds two items: (1) Legislators directly elected by the provinces, regions, Tibet, Mongolia, and counties; (2) Censors elected by the provincial assemblies and the leagues of Mongolia and the local assembly of Tibet.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Changheng believes that after adding the above two items, the total number of National Assembly representatives may increase to about 4,000 people. With the increase in the number of people, holding meetings will be more difficult.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Chen believes that according to the revised draft, the National Assembly representatives are re-elected every six years. Although the Censors are also elected every six years, their election does not coincide with that of the National Assembly representatives. The term of legislators is only three years. In other words, legislators who serve as National Assembly representatives must be elected twice during one National Assembly period. In addition, the election of the President and the election of the legislators and Censors do not coincide either. Furthermore, according to the clauses, the legislators and Censors are created first, followed by the National Assembly, and their re-election must take place before the re-election of the National Assembly. Due to the order of the election periods, various malpractices will arise. Friction will easily occur between the two houses, and between the President and the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the addition of legislators and Censors to the National Assembly representatives, Mr. Wang Chonghui said when reporting on the collation process of the draft Constitution in the Legislative Yuan, that this would increase the contact between the two houses and the National Assembly. Mr. Li Qingxiang also believes that this is an advantage of the revised draft, because if the National Assembly has the provisions of a resident committee (the first draft of the 1934 Constitution stipulated that a National Committee be established during the adjournment period of the National Assembly. The May 5th Draft Constitution deleted this provision, and so does the revised draft), it will easily conflict with the Legislative Yuan and will also have the drawback of being redundant with the Control Yuan. Mr. Li believes that after the legislators serve as representatives of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, in some respects, is equivalent to the resident committee of the National Assembly. During the recess of the National Assembly, legislators, who are more knowledgeable about the law and are often in the capital, can supervise the government and formulate laws based on general legal trends and the current political situation. They can also request a temporary meeting of the National Assembly when necessary. All of these are progressive aspects of the revised draft. Mr. Fu Tongxian also raised similar opinions on how to express the will of the people after the National Assembly adjourns.</p>
<p>According to the May 5th Draft Constitution, the Censors and legislators were originally elected by the National Assembly. According to the revised draft, the Censors are elected by the provincial and municipal assemblies, and the legislators are directly elected by the people. There is a change in the method of production. Zhong Tianxin believes that this change cannot be said to reduce the independence of the legislators and Censors, but rather increases their independence. Chen Guyuan also believes that the legislators and Censors, who are directly or indirectly elected by the people to serve as National Assembly representatives, are more direct than in the original Constitution.</p>
<p>Regarding the powers of the National Assembly, according to the original Constitution, the National Assembly had six types of powers, namely the power to elect the President and Vice President, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan,</p>
<h3 id="e28">Editorial: The Issue of Foreign Troop Deployment! <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the United Nations General Assembly addressed the issue of international disarmament proposed by the Soviet representative, Foreign Minister Molotov again raised the issue of foreign troop deployment at the UN General Assembly Political Committee yesterday. According to the Soviet view, the stationing of foreign troops in the territory of non-enemy countries is a way of interfering in their internal affairs, and therefore the Allied forces should not be stationed in Allied countries. Molotov then proposed that the UN General Assembly request the Security Council to ask member states to submit the following reports within one month: (1) Where and how many troops are stationed by member states in the territory of non-enemy countries; (2) Where and how many troops are stationed by member states in the territory of former enemy countries; Where are the bases and naval defense positions established by member states before and most recently. Molotov continued, "There are still a small number of Soviet troops in Poland, which are used to maintain transportation routes to Germany. As for the Soviet troops in northern Korea, they are stationed there according to agreements with the Allied countries. In contrast, the British and American troops are still stationed in various parts of Europe, Asia and South America long after the war has ended, and their air force bases are even more densely distributed around the world, and some countries feel particularly interested in the two poles. The Soviet government submitted a report to the Security Council in August regarding the stationing of troops in non-enemy countries. The Soviet Union is willing to fulfill this obligation and hopes that other countries will also agree to seek the common interests of the world.</p>
<p>The presentation of this issue aroused the indignation of the American representative Connally, who further stated: "The investigation of troop deployments should include all the troops in the world. Soldiers carrying bayonets, whether on their own land or on foreign land, constitute a threat to peace." Seeing this situation, the British representative had to propose a compromise solution, believing that the suggestions made by the Soviet representative, limited only to armed forces stationed abroad, were insufficient, and advocated the establishment of a staff committee to collect all information on this issue. How this proposal will develop remains to be seen in the future; however, the re-emergence of the issue of foreign troop deployment, and the tone of the Soviet representative, between the lines, fully revealed anti-British and anti-American sentiments amidst calmness, which aroused the emotions of the American representative and led to sharp words. It cannot be said that the presentation of this issue is another naked manifestation of the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States. Molotov even clearly pointed out that there was no reason for the US military to be stationed in China. This reminds us of the proposal made by the Ukrainian representative at the UN General Assembly a month ago to demand the withdrawal of US troops from China, which echoed each other before and after, which is quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Since this issue of foreign troop deployment involves China, our country cannot remain silent. Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative attending the United Nations General Assembly, made some indications at yesterday's meeting. In addition to agreeing with the American amendment, that is, the investigation of troop deployments should not distinguish between domestic and foreign, and member states of the United Nations organizations should announce the number of their troops at home and abroad, he also sternly stated that the US military in China has "caused friction." In addition to endorsing the statement of our representative, we would also like to express our views on the issue of foreign troop deployment.</p>
<p>First, we endorse the Soviet representative's suggestion that the troops stationed by various countries in foreign countries should be investigated, and there is a need to exchange information; but we believe that foreign troop deployments should not be separated from domestic troop deployments, but should be investigated together. Although there is a distinction between domestic and foreign troop deployments, a country's armed forces are a whole; ignoring domestic troop deployments cannot give a clear understanding of foreign troop deployments. What threatens world peace is not only foreign troop deployments, but the sum total of a country's military strength. Therefore, we believe that foreign troop deployments should be investigated, and domestic troop deployments should also be investigated, so that the total strength of a country's military can be clearly understood to see whether it is sufficient to threaten world peace.</p>
<p>Second, we oppose foreign troops interfering in the internal affairs of the host country; but we must understand the difference in the nature of foreign troops. The rule of occupying forces in a defeated country, of course, cannot be said to be foreign troops interfering in internal affairs. Second, since the present world is still centered on national sovereignty, it is the normal exercise of a country's sovereignty for one country to invite the troops of another country to be stationed in its territory. As long as both parties are acting out of free will, this behavior is not enough to constitute an issue that would warrant international discussion, unless this behavior does threaten world peace. If a country sends troops without the consent or invitation of the host country, its behavior is tantamount to aggression and should naturally be intolerable to peace-loving nations. Therefore, we believe that the general statement that Allied forces should not be stationed in Allied countries must be conditional. Otherwise, it is tantamount to restricting the legitimate exercise of a country's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Third, the key to domestic and foreign troop deployments is not only investigation, but also whether they will be reduced after the investigation. Therefore, the issue of troop deployment investigation is actually part of the issue of disarmament. Therefore, we agree with the statement of British Foreign Secretary Bevin: "The investigation of foreign troop deployments and the reduction of armaments are actually one thing" and should be discussed together. If we only talk about the investigation of foreign troop deployments without talking about the investigation of domestic troop deployments, we have not grasped the whole issue; if we only talk about the investigation of domestic and foreign troop deployments without talking about the reduction of armaments, we have not grasped the whole issue. Therefore, foreign troop deployments and disarmament are actually one thing and cannot be separated.</p>
<p>Speaking of the US military stationed in China, it was with the consent of our government and did not interfere in China's internal affairs; it was a legitimate and free exercise of China's sovereignty and should not have been regarded as an issue and submitted for international discussion. Moreover, the number of US troops stationed in China is very small and is not sufficient to threaten world peace. Although the Soviet army has now withdrawn from several major cities in Northeast China, the actual situation of the Soviet army in the Northeast is not well known to the world. Moreover, its withdrawal often does not follow proper channels to be taken over by our government. It is really laughable for the Soviet Union to raise the issue of foreign troop deployment. We hope that there can be less friction in the international community so that there can be sincere cooperation among nations; only in this way can world peace be lasting.</p>

He relied on the power of the enemy to do all kinds of evil. It is unknown how many patriotic people suffered misfortune at his hands. After the victory, he hid in Fengxian and was arrested after being reported. He was brought to the county.

<p>[Report from Jinhua by This Newspaper] The buckwheat and soybeans planted by farmers in this county this year have now matured and have been mostly harvested recently. However, due to the lack of rain this autumn, the harvest has been greatly reduced. According to past practice, each stone (2.5 mu) of farmland can yield 4 dan of buckwheat, but now it only yields 2 dan, which is only 55% of the harvest. The soybean harvest is even worse, with only more than 2 dan per stone, and the soybeans are small. It is generally expected that the price will rise sharply next spring.</p>

<p>[Report from Wuhu by This Newspaper] Cases of bandits killing and robbing goods have occurred continuously in the water and land transportation in Wuhu and nearby areas, dozens of times, and security has been lost. Zhang Xiangze, the deputy commander of the Provincial Security Force, was dispatched to Wuhu on the 20th.

From 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning is curfew time. Half an hour before the curfew, the power plant will issue alarms twice to warn citizens. The sound of the alarm, which threatened the people for eight years, is miserable and piercing, and those who hear it feel very unpleasant. Also, the Fei steamer, which was sailing from Wuhu to Beijing, was robbed by bandits near Xiliang Mountain. The Capital Security Bureau has apprehended the main criminals in this case, Qiu Hede, Lin Jie, Wei Xi, and Zhu Yaodong, in Hexian County and transferred them to Beijing. Zhu Yaodong is not only the main criminal in this case, but he also killed his wife in Hexian County, cut open her abdomen, and dumped her body in the river, which can be described as extremely heinous.</p>

Unexpectedly, recently, gamblers in the four townships have taken advantage of the new harvest to set up gambling dens everywhere, enticing farmers to gamble and making huge profits. Especially in the eastern townships, gambling tables are set up at every market, and the stationed police turn a blind eye, or even stand at the corners of the tables as if they are protecting the gambling. Farmers are ignorant and believe that gambling is allowed in public, so more people join in the gambling.</p>

<h3 id="e51">An Urgent Proposal for Clearing Out Temporary Coffin Storage <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Recently, after reading the regulations issued by the Health Bureau regarding the clearing of temporary coffin storage, I deeply felt the need for improvement. Therefore, I do not hesitate to offer a humble opinion for the authorities to consider.</p>
<p>(1) Those involved in temporary coffin storage have scattered to the four winds during this long war of resistance. In most cases, they cannot remain in a fixed location. Some have lost their homes and jobs, while others have become disabled or died. These are unavoidable realities. If the authorities wish to clear the storage thoroughly, it would be best if the Health Bureau notified the various provincial and county associations in Shanghai to take charge of the matter. At the same time, funeral parlors and temporary coffin storage facilities should provide detailed reports of the names, origins, and addresses of those who have stored coffins, compiled by province and county, and forwarded to the respective provincial associations in Shanghai for handling. This would ensure widespread awareness and prevent situations where no one comes forward to take care of the matter. (2) After the funeral parlors, etc., have reported the circumstances of those who have stored coffins, the relevant provincial associations should negotiate transportation methods and set the amount of fees, but they should be proportionate to the distance to determine the amount of fees, so that depositors can pay according to regulations. If it is found that some are indeed poor and unable to cope, the associations should prepare a list and apply to the Health Bureau for financial assistance or appeal to enthusiastic philanthropists for more relief. If the gentlemen involved in coffin storage sympathize with the above humble opinion, I hope that there will be more concrete measures to promote its realization, to comfort the spirits of the deceased in foreign lands.

<p>Your newspaper published an article on the 18th of this month entitled "Atrocities are Forgotten in Leniency, Torturers are Returning Home." We are grateful for this great spirit, which is like a surge of heat reminding the hearts of all Chinese compatriots. Those who have suffered all kinds of torture under the iron hooves of the enemy without yielding, and the martyred heroes who have been loyal to their duties, may have another chance to seek justice and revenge. On behalf of the wounded and dead soldiers and civilians, we put forward a few requests: (1) We hope that the head of the War Criminals Management Office will approve another general identification. (2) The identification time is too short. The comrades who suffered in remote areas cannot identify them due to transportation, travel expenses, and other difficulties. The War Criminals Management Office should disclose the information several days in advance so that the comrades who have suffered all kinds of hardships in remote areas can also come to seek revenge. (3) If the victim's family only knows the name of the murderer but does not know the person, we hope that the management authorities will do their best to help with the inspection to prevent anyone from slipping through the net. (4) We hope that the government authorities will do their best to arrange for the families of the martyred comrades and heroes to comfort the loyal souls. (Zhang Huizhong)</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Smyrna, 23rd] The US fleet patrolling the Mediterranean entered Turkish territorial waters at 10 pm last night and entered this port at 7:30 am this morning. The fleet includes the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier "Randolph," the cruiser "Fargo," and several escort ships. The authorities of ten countries here warmly welcomed the US fleet. Political observers believe that the US fleet's visit is of great significance amid the renewed tension over the Dardanelles Strait. It is recalled that the US battleship "Missouri" visited Istanbul, Turkey on March 1st this year, at a time when Soviet-Turkish relations were tense. This time, the US fleet will stay for three days, then sail to the small port of Marmaris south of here. After leaving Turkish territorial waters, the fleet will visit Lebanon, and then return to Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] A Foreign Office spokesman told the press today: After the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, Britain hopes that Egypt will be solely responsible for the defense of the Suez Canal. Britain's attitude towards the management of the Dardanelles Strait is consistent with its policy towards the Suez Canal. The status of both the strait and the canal is stipulated by international agreements as international waterways, and Britain believes that the original state should be maintained.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 22nd] The right-wing newspaper "Vradyni" today carried a special dispatch from Salonika stating: According to authoritative sources, 18,000 US troops will arrive in Salonika at the beginning of next month, and everything is being arranged there. However, Colonel Walkeritz, the US military attache in Athens, did not comment on this news.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Demanding Reports on Overseas Troops - Soviet Union Ridicules Britain's Attempt to Evade - Molotov Reiterates That It Cannot Be Compared with the Disarmament Proposal <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] Molotov addressed the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly today, opposing the British delegation's proposal to discuss the investigation of foreign troops at the same time as the disarmament proposal. He reiterated that the Soviet Union was willing to provide information on its domestic troops, but said that this issue should be related to the disarmament issue. He pointed out that the issue of foreign troops itself is a major issue, while universal disarmament is an even more important matter. If the two matters are discussed together, one will inevitably lose sight of the other. Although there is no refusal of the investigation of foreign troops, there are attempts to evade it. It must be known that any evasive answer is harmful rather than beneficial. I hope that all members can unanimously support this proposal. Strong countries should regard this as their responsibility, and small countries can also obtain guarantees as a result.</p>
<p>The French representative, Parodi, declared that he would support the Soviet proposal, but felt that this matter could not be discussed at the same time as the disarmament proposal, pointing out that the specific parts of the Soviet proposal could not be buried in the larger disarmament issue. Upon hearing this, the British representative, Bevin, immediately stood up and stated that the British delegation had no intention of concealing any part of the Soviet proposal, but only wished to discuss the two matters at the same time. He believed that the French representative's page was actually equivalent to supporting the British proposal.</p>
<p>Molotov spoke for as long as 50 minutes. He particularly pointed out the matter of British troops stationed in Greece, saying that in peacetime, the stationing of a large army of a strong country in the territory of a small country would naturally cause psychological anxiety. The stationing of troops directly affects the interests, security, independence, and freedom of various countries, so there is sufficient reason to discuss it. Although the war has ended and the environment has changed, the issue of stationing troops is still a major issue. There is no reason for the stationing of troops in other UN member states. If the troop-stationing country believes it is reasonable, it should offer an explanation. Now that the military need has disappeared, the stationing of foreign troops has caused extreme unease in world opinion. Previously, many disputes arose in the Security Council due to the stationing of Soviet troops in Iran, but at that time the Soviet government announced the reasons for its delayed withdrawal from Iran. The Soviet Union has fulfilled its obligations to Iran. Now we still do not know whether other foreign troops in Iran have been withdrawn. In fact, no one can know the exact situation there, but we should assume that the foreign troops there have been completely withdrawn. Molotov continued, the stationing of foreign troops in Greece, no one can deny that it is exerting pressure on the domestic political situation there. In addition, there are the matters of the United States and Iceland due to the stationing of troops, etc. In short, the issue of stationing troops is a major issue among international countries. This is why the Soviet representative country can strongly advocate disclosure.</p>
<p>British and American Reactions</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The US representative, Connally, told reporters afterwards that the United States can provide detailed reports on the number of domestic and foreign troops at any time in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly. The British delegation said that Mr. Molotov's tone was moderate, but unfortunately it was not consistent with his speech on Wednesday. In addition, it is learned that Mr. Connally and the British representative, Noel-Baker, will respond to Molotov at tomorrow's meeting. The United States also intends to propose a compromise plan between the issue of reporting on foreign troops and the issue of disarmament, so as to reconcile the positions of Britain and the Soviet Union. The content has not yet been published. However, it is learned that the United States believes that the issue of troop reporting is of secondary nature compared to the issue of disarmament. The proposals of Britain and the Soviet Union are expected to be submitted to the Political Committee for a vote today.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Department of the Navy, together with other relevant government agencies, also came forward today to deal with the coal miners' strike led by Lewis, the chairman of the Miners' Union. In order to remedy the cessation of bituminous coal production, the department has ordered the commanders of various military districts to rent out surplus naval generators to the private sector to maintain public use, and to sell surplus naval bituminous coal and electricity when absolutely necessary. Lewis remained silent, outwardly calm, and has accepted the court's subpoena for contempt of court, thus formally confronting the government. Lewis is determined to fight for a legal strike, as seen in the continued strike of 400,000 miners, who only need one word from Lewis to resume work. Lewis' acceptance of the legal challenge has dashed hopes of resuming work before the 25th. The government is proceeding with a fuel storage plan and intends to order a ban on all freight transport, except for essential goods; but the Department of National Defense Transportation announced that it will have to wait a few days to implement it to observe developments. The court subpoena ordered Lewis to explain why he and the United Mine Workers Union should not be punished. Lewis can avoid punishment if he orders the miners to resume work before the 25th, otherwise he will be tried on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Also from Washington] The US government is deeply afraid that the coal miners' strike will be prolonged and that power plants will run out of fuel. It has ordered 21 states and the capital to implement power conservation starting on the 25th, reducing advertising and shop window lighting, reducing department store elevators by a quarter, and canceling all decorative lighting. Civil Production Management Committee Member Smal warned that the lack of coal will devastate the national economy and suffer major difficulties.</p>

<p>Soviet Capital Praises Without Reservation</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Deputy Secretary of State Acheson expressed today that the United States is dissatisfied with the Romanian election. It is said that although the election results have not been fully announced, the United States can declare that the voting was not free, and what actions the United States will take are unknown. In London, a British Foreign Office spokesman also said: The elections in Romania were neither fair nor free, and Britain's relations with Romania are now under consideration. A reporter asked whether the cancellation of recognition of Romania would affect the signing of the Romanian peace treaty. The British Foreign Office spokesman replied: "The British government only concludes peace treaties with recognized governments." and said: According to the report from the representative in Romania, duplicate votes were found in the election, opposition candidates often did not receive ballots, and opposition observers were often excluded from polling stations. Moscow believes that the rise of the Romanian Communist Party in the democratic bloc is "a victory for Romanian democracy." Soviet newspapers carried news from Bucharest, saying that the election results proved that the Romanian people unanimously support the Groza government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st, United Press] The Romanian opposition parties recently issued a communiqué, declaring that each party believes that the general election of the parliament is invalid, and warned that each party will fight for a new national election, but the reasons have not been announced. In this general election, the government bloc controlled by the Communist Party won a great victory.</p>

<p>[United Press, Baltimore, 22nd] US Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz said today: We have already known a direction that allows the Navy to deal with atomic bombs. The Navy neither ignores atomic bombs nor underestimates their value, but this new weapon does not make the Navy obsolete. As long as mankind uses the sea, there must be naval forces.

<h3 id="e71">Order to Eliminate Japanese Zaibatsu - Scope of Application Expanded <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Allied Control Council Scheduled to Meet on the 27th</p>
<p>[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding the issue of eliminating the Zaibatsu, the Japanese government has designated Zaibatsu-related companies as "restricted companies" since December, based on the directive issued by the Allied Headquarters on November 6 last year, and restricted the dissolution of these companies, changes in capital, and the movement of major assets. It has now been decided to expand the application of the restriction to the subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries of the Zaibatsu companies, and an imperial edict will be promulgated on the 25th and implemented immediately. The edict stipulates that these restricted companies are prohibited from holding shares in other companies, and also stipulates that the employees of these companies may not hold any positions in other companies. These companies may not enter into contracts with other companies that restrict freedom of trade and competition, and contracts that attempt to control these non-restricted companies. The purpose of the regulations is to eliminate the behavior of restricted companies directly or indirectly using their subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries to control the economic world.</p>
<p>[Also from Tokyo] The measures taken by the Japanese government in the past to dismember the Zaibatsu were like using an iceberg to describe the Zaibatsu, only reaching the part that emerged from the water, while this measure is implemented on the larger part that is submerged under the water. The special connections between the holding company (Zaibatsu company) and its subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries in terms of capital, personnel, and contracts are completely severed. If it can be thoroughly implemented, the elimination of the Zaibatsu can be achieved as scheduled. The number of restricted companies (parent companies) designated by this edict reaches 1,180.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, 22nd] At the request of the Soviet representative, the Allied Control Council for Japan will hold its 20th meeting on the 27th of this month to discuss the issue of cleaning up the Japanese Zaibatsu and the progress made in the cleanup work. Another issue on the agenda is that there are still dozens of members of the Japanese Diet who need to be purged.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The U.S. military government announced today that four Koreans and one U.S. official flew to China today to assist in the revival of Sino-Korean trade. It is said that Sino-Korean trade has been interrupted for a long time due to transportation difficulties and lack of information.

<h3 id="e77">British Labour Party "Rebel" Faction Leader Speaks: Labour Governance is Superior to Churchill's Government; Opposes Anglo-American Armaments Standardization Plan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, London, 22nd] Labour MP Crossman, leader of the faction opposing the current British foreign policy, declared today that the Anglo-American armaments standardization plan will make Britain an American aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe. He believes that Britain should either conclude military agreements with both the United States and the Soviet Union, or not conclude any at all.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 22nd] Crossman, the leader of the Labour "rebel" MPs who proposed an amendment to foreign policy, delivered another speech here today, stating that his criticism of the government only selects points that deserve criticism, and there is absolutely no excess or injustice, because the Labour government is ultimately better than when Churchill was in power. If today's government were led by Churchill, India would be in a state of war, and the rift between Western countries and the Soviet Union would be irreparable.</p>
<p>He continued: The Soviet Union's expansion in Eastern Europe and Iran should be stopped, but the economic imperialist policy adopted by the United States in the Far East should also be resisted. Has Japan not become a colony of the United States today? A socialist Britain should represent the world in resisting imperialism, regardless of whether this imperialism is left-leaning or right-leaning, American or Russian. We cannot agree with what the Americans call "free trade." The United States wants to take advantage of "free trade" to control the world market and destroy the interests of others; the United States also uses loans to exert political pressure. If we are solely linked with the United States or the Soviet Union, our strength will inevitably weaken. Only by maintaining independence and cooperating with both sides, speaking for the people of the world, can we maintain our strength.</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Five Powers Resumed Meetings Yesterday to Discuss Limiting the Veto Power; The Trieste Issue Awaits Negotiation by the Four Foreign Ministers <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our New York correspondent, 23rd] At 3:30 PM today, the Five Powers will deal with the veto issue based on the Anglo-American plan, in order to reduce the number of times the veto is used, so as to avoid new demands from other countries to amend the United Nations Charter. The four foreign ministers will meet at 5:00 PM in the afternoon to reach a certain agreement on the Trieste issue based on the principle of mutual concessions. However, Byrnes and Bevin do not seem willing to make many modifications to the plan passed by the Paris Peace Conference. As for the issue of foreign troops stationed abroad, the Soviet Union seems to be able to obtain partial satisfaction, and the number of American troops in Europe will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Associated Press, New York, 22nd] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is expected to find a compromise solution to the Soviet Union's firm demand for the periodic withdrawal of troops stationed in Trieste. It is said that the United States has proposed reducing the occupying forces in the international zone to the minimum necessary to maintain law and order, which should lead to a compromise. The center of the dispute lies in mutual fear of how the other party will use the veto power. If the Soviet Union wins, it can prevent the return of withdrawn troops in the event of future disturbances in Trieste. Conversely, if the power to stipulate the deadline for troop withdrawal is granted to the Security Council, as advocated by Western countries, any country can prevent troop withdrawal indefinitely. According to participants in the discussion, the second of the two issues that are still deadlocked is less difficult. It is only focused on the Soviet Union's demand for Yugoslavia to participate in the management rights of the Trieste railway. Molotov has already conceded, abandoning the Trieste-Yugoslav customs union request.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: The newly appointed chairman of the Indian Congress Party, Kriplani, delivered a speech today, saying that freedom is in sight, and urging the Indian people to step up their efforts. Regarding foreign policy, the new chairman of the Congress emphasized strengthening friendly relations with all countries and hoped to improve relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Meerut, United Provinces, India, 22nd] The All-India Congress Committee resolved here to ask Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian Interim Government, to request Governor-General Wavell of India to ask the Muslim League personnel to withdraw from the Interim Government, because Muslim League leader Jinnah declared yesterday that the Muslim League would not participate in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on December 9, which is inevitably contrary to the declaration issued by the British delegation on May 16.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Nehru accused the Muslim League at the Congress Committee on Thursday of trying to seek British support since joining the Interim Government, which is no different from being an agent of the British King in the Interim Government. The Muslim League member Liakat, the Finance Minister of the Interim Government, issued a statement today, saying that since the Muslim League joined the cabinet, it has never used the Governor-General's powers or requested the British government to interfere in its affairs. He asked Nehru to present concrete facts to prove his words.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Inauguration Ceremony of President Tu of St. John's University; US Ambassador Attends Especially; Three Thoughtful Remarks on University Construction <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The inauguration ceremony of Dr. Tu Yu-ching, the new president of St. John's University in this city, was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. Ambassador Stuart traveled from Beijing to attend. All faculty, students, and guests attended happily. About 50 academic staff and faculty members were present, all wearing academic gowns of various colors. The ceremony was grand, and the situation can be described as enthusiastic.</p>
<p>After Ambassador Stuart and guests Kong Xiangxi, British Consul-General Davis, and British Consul-General Ogden arrived at the school, they first rested and had tea in the school's social hall. At 4:00 PM, all faculty and guests gathered in front of the office hall, wearing academic regalia, lined up in two rows, and entered the auditorium of Si En Hall in an orderly manner. Ambassador Stuart, wearing a Doctor of Divinity gown, was in the third row from the last, President Xu was in the second row from the last, and Honorary President Bu Fangji and Chairman of the Board Yan Huiqing were in the last row.</p>
<p>The ceremony began with music, the team entered the venue, the stage was filled with flower baskets, and there was a shield and a silver cup on the table, with a school seal wrapped in red silk in the middle. Everyone stood up and sang the national anthem, and Bishop Luo gave a prayer in Mandarin.</p>
<p>Presidents Bu Fangji and Franklin Delivered Speeches in Succession</p>
<p>Dr. Bu Fangji served as chairman, first speaking in Mandarin and then in English, stating briefly: St. John's University went through the most difficult and arduous period during the war. Now that the war has ended, the university is also working hard to move forward. The university has a long history of 67 years. Now the board of directors has hired Dr. Tu Yu-ching as president. Dr. Tu has profound knowledge and rich experience and is the most suitable person. I hope he will work hard for the university and wish him success.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Franklin spoke on behalf of the founders, saying: St. John's graduates in the past have made great achievements in all aspects of society. This not only contributes a lot to China but also does its best for the world. Dr. Tu's appointment as president will definitely be competent, and St. John's will have greater expansion and contribution in the future. I would like to express my congratulations on behalf of the founders.</p>
<p>Stuart's Speech</p>
<p>Amidst warm applause, Ambassador Stuart delivered his Mandarin speech with a heavy tone and a sincere attitude, saying: "I am honored to be invited to participate in the ceremony of my old friend Dr. Tu Yu-ching's inauguration as president of St. John's University. I don't want to use ordinary words to express my congratulations now. I would like to ask you to allow me to speak a few words from a personal standpoint.</p>
<p>More than forty years ago, when I was studying in the United States and came to [laughter from the audience, the ambassador also laughed, showing that he always had China in mind], I began to think about what the best way to express the goodwill of the United States to China was. I was deeply impressed by the success of St. John's University. Later, when I became the president of Yenching University, I always wanted to take St. John's University as a model and encouragement, and try to emulate the example of Dr. Bu Fangji, the old president of St. John's University. At that time, I was especially thinking about how to make Yenching University's contribution to training Chinese youth, based on China's situation at the time, as successful as St. John's University had achieved in its early years.</p>
<p>Therefore, my hope for the new president of this famous institution of higher learning comes from my own experience. I hope that he will continue the great traditional spirit of the university, adapt the university's policies and activities to the changing situation in China, and be able to meet the needs of modern students, and enable their students to cooperate with their chosen careers, just like the early achievements of the university were a standard for other schools.</p>
<p>Three Suggestions</p>
<p>Regarding this point, I can offer three suggestions on how to enable all our Christian universities to serve China most effectively in the current stage of development.</p>
<p>First, the new president of St. John's University is taking office during the most important period in China's long history. Now is the second stage of revolutionary progress, that is, the period of political tutelage, which will enter a true democracy. But if there is no intelligent, patriotic, and courageous citizen who is active and supports or criticizes government affairs according to the needs of the environment, then there can be no clean and effective democratic government. This should be the work of Chinese youth, and this university should encourage, guide, and prepare them for this most important task.</p>
<p>Second, in the world we live in now, mankind must maintain peaceful international relations, otherwise mankind will suffer from war, and future wars will be more terrible and destructive than all the wars in human history. The task of the university should be to develop an international perspective for students, to make them understand the existing world problems, and to develop a new conscience for our common humanity. It will enable them to assist their country in approaching the concept of world harmony that Confucius spoke of. Confucius once said: "All within the four seas are brothers."</p>
<p>Key to Achieving People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Third, and finally, what may be considered the most important point is that these church universities have an unparalleled mission. The truth of this mission is no less than the original intention of establishing the school to promote the gospel. Ultimately, China's political difficulties and obstacles are all moral problems. Promoting the lofty leaders of the Christian faith is very helpful to the people. This point has been recognized by the public. As the Christian creed teaches us, and as Jesus practiced in his life, our service to society and the country should be inspired by love and hope, and remove all selfishness and sensuality. This will have a great influence on Chinese youth, and this influence is also the key to realizing democracy and other progress. This coincides with the Chinese emphasis on moral training and philosophical education. In view of the similarities between the great historical tradition of China and the tradition of St. John's, as well as the serious problems facing China today, I would like to express to President Tu: I firmly believe that he will maintain the original tradition of St. John's and try to adapt to the new needs of China today, and adapting to needs is the purpose of establishing St. John's University.</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Presided Over the Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>Then Dr. Yan Huiqing presided over the inauguration ceremony on behalf of the board of directors, officially granting the name of President of St. John's University and hoping that he would do his best for the university and increase the university's honor.</p>
<p>New President's Reply</p>
<p>Finally, the new president, Dr. Tu, gave a reply, saying that he has shallow knowledge and does not dare to take on the heavy responsibility of this university with a glorious history of 67 years, but with the urging of all the directors, the cooperation of teachers and students, and the encouragement of friends, he is determined to serve in the spirit of Christ. He will do his part. Tu also elaborated on the consequences of modern scientific education, agreeing with Ambassador Stuart's words, hoping that modern youth should experience and understand the relationship between people in life, and should pay attention to improving general knowledge. According to the school motto of "Learning without thinking is futile," Tu especially emphasized: "Learning without thinking is futile in elementary school, and learning without thinking is chaotic in university."</p>
<p>After the reply, the school song was sung, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 after Bishop Luo's blessing.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Free Medical Treatment for Citizens; Ideal Plan to Wait Another Twenty-Five Years <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The small group meeting of the Urban Planning Committee's health group was recently convened by the Health Bureau, hosted by Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau. The meeting resolved that a large number of health offices must be added within 25 years. The most reasonable ideal is that every 100,000 people in a large city should have a health office. In rural areas, because the population density is smaller, 50,000 people can be used as the principle. According to the urban plan decided by this city, the future population of Shanghai is 7 million, so 70 health offices are needed, which is still far from what this city currently has. The number of beds in municipal hospitals should also be actively increased. It is hoped that within five years, there will be one bed for every thousand citizens. Within fifteen years, there will be one bed for every five hundred citizens. Within twenty-five years, there will be one bed for every three hundred citizens. And the ultimate ideal is that after twenty-five years, citizens will receive free diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, within 25 years, the city's tap water must be able to be universally supplied, and the sewage system must be well-equipped, so that the prevalence of infectious diseases can be reduced. The number of parks, sports grounds, and open spaces in the urban area must be greatly increased, and cremation should be promoted so that the ground is fully utilized. In the future, garbage, in addition to being used to fill low-lying areas and ponds, is also planned to use composting methods to turn waste into fertilizer to facilitate cultivation.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing to work hard to make the above beautiful vision a reality, the Health Bureau is now actively preparing to build a large-scale tuberculosis sanatorium with 500 beds. Medical equipment, medicines, etc. are all supplied by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Recently, due to the American sailors' strike, it has been delayed. It is said that there are no problems with the sanatorium's funding and location.</p>
<p>In addition, the Health Bureau plans to build a hospital each in Pudong, Huxi, and Hudong. The funding has been approved by the municipal government, and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has also agreed to allocate medical supplies, etc., and construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the import license system is implemented, the customs will strengthen the enforcement of anti-smuggling work and are actively studying ways to improve efficiency. According to relevant sources: At the beginning of the customs' restoration, manpower and material resources were insufficient, so smuggling was very rampant. In the past two months, due to the strengthening of inspections of territorial waters and ports, many cases of smuggled goods have been cracked, so the situation has improved. In the past, many of the smuggled items were carried by sailors on ships carrying relief supplies to China. At present, the customs has been able to control this situation. Regarding the smuggling of goods by foreign warships, it is difficult to check in territorial waters, but land inspections have been strengthened in ports as a remedy. In the past, airplanes were also an important source of smuggled goods. Now, the customs has sent personnel to be stationed at various airports to strictly guard against them day and night. At present, the customs' anti-smuggling work has three lines of defense: the first line is a large ship that regularly patrols outside the Wusongkou; the second line is a team of small ships that patrol near the port; and the third line is two teams of inspectors who are responsible for inspecting ships after they enter the port.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Another Entanglement After Plasma; Sold Narcotics; the US Side Wants to Take Them Back; Representative of Lida Bank Reports to the Mayor <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The dispute over the resale of plasma from US surplus materials has just been resolved, and it has been discovered that medical narcotics are also mixed in with the materials sold. The US Materials Clearing Committee also issued a statement the day before yesterday: "We are conducting a thorough investigation into this matter and will take the necessary appropriate measures."</p>
<p>According to Lida Trading Bank yesterday, it is true that there are some narcotics in the medicines purchased by the bank. However, the exact number of types and quantities is still unknown. Because when the materials purchased were shipped from Okinawa to China, the customs did not allow the narcotics to be cleared, and they had to wait for the approval of the Ministry of Interior before they could be imported. Therefore, the narcotics are still stored in various warehouses and have not been cleared. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of Lida Bank visited the mayor to explain this point.</p>
<p>Although the Materials Clearing Committee has issued a statement, it has not yet begun negotiations with the merchants as of yesterday. It is said that the Clearing Committee intends to recover the narcotics in the same way as the plasma, and also recover them by compensating with other medicines. However, the merchants feel quite overwhelmed by the repeated problems with this batch of materials. Because purely from a commercial standpoint, there is no need to return legally ordered goods. Moreover, when the contract was signed, the various products on the product list were clearly stated, including plasma. Therefore, the responsibility for the mis-sale lies entirely with the negligence of the US side. However, because they do not want to involve diplomatic relations in this matter, the recovery of narcotics after plasma is also likely to be unavoidable. What remains to be negotiated is only the conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, what kind of medicines the US will use to compensate for the recovered plasma is still to be decided by the Materials Clearing Committee, the Navy, and the Marine Corps after consultation tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<h3 id="e84">Registration Period for Import and Export Merchants; Plan to Request a Seven-Day Extension <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Import and Export Association believes that the recently promulgated amendments to the import and export trade regulations and implementation rules by the Executive Yuan have a significant impact on the rights and interests of the association's members. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, it convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. More than 30 directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Chairman Zhang Huanzhang. Chen Changtong, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee, was unable to attend temporarily due to business. After discussion, many important cases were resolved. The two most important points are: (1) The registration period for import and export merchants in the amended regulations is limited to 15 days from November 17, which seems too tight. It is planned to request a seven-day extension. (2) For goods that have been approved for import, it is planned to promptly stipulate the shortest date for issuing permits.</p>
<p>According to observations by import and export industry insiders: In the past two or three weeks, the handling of import and export merchant registration matters and the exchange settlement matters of the Central Bank and various designated banks have been virtually declared to have been suspended.</p>

<p>The shoulder-carrying dispute at the Swire Wharf on the Bund of Jinling Road, caused by the unreasonable squeeze of old workers led by Zhou Ruisun by the new workers led by Chen Shanyu, has left hundreds of people destitute.

It is now learned that the group of unemployed old workers continued to gather at the Swire Wharf in the past two days, resolutely demanding reinstatement. The stalemate between the old and new factions of workers has forced the cargo transport operations at the wharf to be suspended for three days now, severely impacting transportation work. It is reported that Mayor Wu summoned the representatives of the old workers, Zhou Ruisun and others, yesterday morning to inquire about everything, promising to consider and swiftly seek a reasonable resolution. Furthermore, the British Swire Company, due to the ongoing dispute between the old and new factions of workers affecting cargo operations, sent representatives yesterday to urge the municipal authorities to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Street Vendors: Methods Changed</p>
<p>Regarding the recent crackdown on street vendors, Director Xuan, in consideration of the livelihoods of the common people and to maintain the appearance of this international city, has made some changes to the crackdown methods, which have been submitted to the municipal government for approval as follows: (1) In the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, except for newspaper vendors whose displays do not obstruct traffic, no vendors are allowed to set up stalls on sidewalks or in alleys. If there are public or private vacant lots in these districts, they are allowed to concentrate their businesses there. (2) In districts other than Huangpu and Lao Zha, as long as the vendor locations are surveyed and announced by the Bureau, and the source of goods is legitimate, the types of vendors will not be temporarily restricted (originally limited to newspapers, snacks, and cigarettes), but each stall base is limited to three feet in length and width, and no sheds or stoves may be erected. (3) Vendor items will no longer be confiscated, and will be subject to fines or detention, except for those selling US military supplies or other prohibited items.</p>
<p>Entry and Exit of Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Also, in October, 40 foreign nationals entered the city (including 31 American citizens, 3 British citizens, 2 Polish citizens, and 1 each from France, Greece, South Africa, and the Philippines). A total of 1,024 people left the city, including 684 men and 340 women. By nationality, the United Kingdom had the most, followed by the United States, India, and the Soviet Union. The destinations of the departing foreign nationals were mostly to the United States, with 270 people. Hong Kong was second, with 131 people. A total of 623 people went to 43 other places, including the United Kingdom and Manila. Last month, a total of 779 foreign nationals in the city traveled within the country. The most popular destinations were Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Hankou, and Beiping, totaling 576 people. Another 203 people went to Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Taiwan Province.</p>
<p>Campaign to Eliminate Water Theft</p>
<p>Subsequently, the head of the theft section reported that recently, theft in the Huangpu River area has been rampant. Director Xuan, in order to protect travelers, issued an order to the Criminal Investigation Department and the 15 branch bureaus last Saturday to implement a campaign to eliminate water theft. After a week of investigation, a total of 129 thieves and 16 receivers of stolen goods, totaling 145 people, have been arrested. They have been transferred to the District Attorney's Office today (the 23rd). In the future, the Bureau will continue to follow its original plan, gradually "from point to surface," "from land to water," and "from the center to the outside," and to implement regular comprehensive prevention. The arrested thieves, the "water rats" with high "skills," account for about a quarter. The targets of these thieves are: (1) ships that have just arrived in port, (2) docks, (3) warehouses. Their methods are: (1) using coolies to abuse their position for personal gain or employees to embezzle, (2) stevedores deliberately damaging wooden boxes during the unloading of goods, causing the goods to scatter on the ground, (3) false pretense of loading.</p>
<p>Prevalence of Theft; Culprits Located</p>
<p>The police also analyzed the causes of this rampant theft, stating that (1) it is difficult to eradicate evil forces, (2) dockworkers' wages are transferred and exploited by foremen, resulting in meager earnings, and (3) there are many ships without regulation. Receivers of stolen goods also have their special organizations, and true leaders are not easily caught. Most of them use refugees to go to various docks and warehouses to buy stolen goods, collect them, and then sell them in batches. Finally, Mr. Liu stated that although this arrest operation is passive, the security authorities are taking a stand to maintain security and to remind citizens to pay attention, hence this parade.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Zhang Tao, the Fake Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; He Lowers His Head in Silence Upon Hearing the Verdict <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wang Bingyan’s Testimony is Full of Grand Principles</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Zhang Tao, the fake chief justice of the puppet Supreme Court, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with deprivation of civil rights for life, and all property confiscated except for a discretionary amount left for the necessary living expenses of his family. Zhang is 61 years old, a native of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. In the 27th year, when Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and others organized the puppet Reformed Government, he served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan and chairman of the Economic Committee. In the 29th year, when Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the puppet National Government, he transferred to the puppet Supreme Court as chief justice, until the victory. Yesterday, he was escorted to court by bailiffs in a blue silk robe. With gray hair, he was saddened to hear the verdict, lowering his head in silence. The presiding judge informed him that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could appeal for a review within ten days after receiving the judgment, and then ordered him to be detained.</p>
<p>In the same afternoon, Wang Dong, also known as Wang Bingyan, 75 years old, from Changzhou, Jiangsu, was interrogated. He had served as the chief of the Zhabei Security Corps in this city. He was accused of serving as the head of the 7th district of the enemy's naval Baojia during the occupation of Shanghai, and of coercing residents to offer gold to the enemy. The defendant testified yesterday that he had devoted his life to local charitable and public welfare undertakings. During the Songhu Qilu War in the 13th year of the Republic, he was ordered to organize the Zhabei Security Corps of the Shanghai and Shi counties to maintain local security, comfort the defeated troops, and provide supplies, which cost more than 460,000 yuan, all paid for by his private property. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out this time, he again supervised the Security Corps to defend the local area. After the fall of Shanghai, he retreated to the Soviet Concession under an assumed name and devoted himself to Buddhism. In the 33rd year, he was elected as the head of the district by the residents of the district. Because he was usually enthusiastic about local public welfare, he could not refuse the position, so he served for several months until February of the 34th year when he resigned due to illness. The matter of offering gold was organized by the enemy's Baojia Headquarters, and the residents of Shanghai were difficult to resist under the circumstances at the time. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a memorial service will be held by people from all walks of life, and at 4:00 PM, a burial ceremony will be held. The National Government's commendation order was delivered last night. The original text is as follows: "Yu Qiaqing had a faithful nature and a clear mind. In his early years, he lived in Shanghai, creating and developing industries and transportation. During the Xinhai Songhu Restoration, he raised funds for the army and did not shy away from difficulties. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he came from Guanxi. His patriotism was second to none. We are deeply saddened by his death. He should be commended by explicit order, and his life's achievements should be stored in the National History Museum to show his great virtue and encourage future generations. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Ban on Divination and Astrology; Hope for Gradual Implementation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yangming and Zhang Qianli Speak</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] It is reported that the Municipal Government has been ordered to ban folk superstitions, including divination and astrology. According to Yang Yangming of the Astrologers Mutual Aid Association (all members are blind), he told reporters that in addition to begging, Chinese blind people only have astrology as a profession. There are about 3,000 blind people in the city who practice astrology. Therefore, banning astrology is tantamount to collective suicide for blind fortune tellers. Moreover, astrology has thousands of years of history. Based on the Book of Changes, it deduces fate, which is beneficial to the world and people's hearts and can supplement the shortcomings of the law.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Qianli, the person in charge of the Institute of Numerology and Philosophy (all members are sighted), he told reporters that from a political standpoint, the association does not intend to express anything regarding the government's ban on astrology, but from an academic standpoint, astrology is China's inherent philosophy. They deeply hope that the government will reconsider and suggest that the authorities take a screening examination method to replace the ban. Zhang also said that fortune telling can make frustrated people more encouraged, and make tough people reformed, so that the society reduces disputes. As for the association's purpose, it is to connect like-minded people, learn from each other, and at the same time persuade people to do good and engage in psychological construction.</p>

<p>In order to rectify military and police discipline and strengthen the management of transportation agencies, Mayor Wu and Garrison Commander Zhou Tie Wu will jointly issue a proclamation on the issue of military and police riding without tickets, in order to supplement the deficiencies of the regulations issued by the municipal government in October last year. The new measures are as follows: (1) Military and police wearing uniforms and symbols can enjoy preferential transportation. Regardless of the distance of the route, they will pay the minimum fare for each route. (2) Military and police accompanied by companions will not enjoy the above rights. It is reported that these measures will be implemented today, including all public buses and trams in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Telephone Company Denies New Building on the Bund <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Company, he told our newspaper reporter that it is absolutely not true that the company will build an 18-story new building on the vacant land next to the China Merchants Bureau on the Bund. Because the location is improper and does not meet the needs of the telephone company. However, the company will indeed build a tall new building. The location has not yet been determined. The company originally planned to build a higher building on the vacant land next to the Juxingcheng Bank on Hankou Road, but it has not yet been approved by the Public Works Bureau. It is still under negotiation. Because the location is quite suitable for the needs of the telephone company, and the landlord of the vacant land also intends to sell the land to the telephone company. If the negotiation fails, the Shanghai Telephone Company will find another suitable location to build the new building.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Fan Zhongqu Talks About Recent Economic Conditions in Sichuan Province: Industrial and Commercial Recession, Relatively Stable Financial Sector, Sichuan People Place High Hopes on Export Goods <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, Southwest industrial and commercial professionals working in Shanghai held a banquet at the New Life Club on Tongfu Road to welcome Fan Zhongqu, the chairman of the Chongqing Banking Association, who had come to Shanghai. Many well-known figures from Sichuan who were working in Shanghai attended. The reporter met with Mr. Fan and inquired about the financial and economic situation in Sichuan. He kindly provided the following analysis: The financial market in Sichuan Province and Chongqing is more stable than that in Shanghai. The interest rate for general commercial loans is 1.1% per month.</p>
<p>It once rose to around 1.2% by the end of September, but it immediately stabilized after the issuance of 1 billion public treasury bonds. The main reasons why the financial market is relatively stable are: (1) Prices are much lower than in Beijing and Shanghai, about one-sixth. Pork in Chongqing sells for 600 yuan per catty [approximately 500g], and other items are similar. (2) The scale and frequency of large commercial transactions cannot be compared to the Shanghai market, making it easier to calculate the amount of funds to be raised in the market. (3) Commercial banks in Chongqing exchange checks twice a day, unlike here, where they only exchange them once in the afternoon. The advantage of this is that after one exchange, the amount of funds that need to be prepared for the day can be estimated. In this way, banks do not have to withdraw too much reserve funds, and a portion of the funds is not frozen, indirectly reducing their interest burden, and the market interest rate is not raised. In the past, some people advocated raising interest rates to prevent idle funds from being used to hoard materials due to low bank interest rates, but this did not materialize after being opposed. As for the current industrial and commercial situation in Sichuan, it is also generally in a recession. In terms of industry, the cost of products is higher than that of foreign goods, making it difficult to compete. In commerce, in the past, general stores, in view of the upward trend in prices, tried their best to purchase goods. Now, a large number of imported goods are entering the market at low prices, making it impossible for merchants who have stockpiled goods to sell them off. Sichuan people place high hopes on export goods such as bristles and tung oil, but today the transportation problem is difficult, and most of the ships on the Sichuan River have been requisitioned for military transport, which greatly hinders the export of goods. However, despite the above circumstances, the economic environment in Sichuan Province is still relatively stable. In the past, an industrialist predicted that the wave of industrial and commercial recession in our country would spread from the outside to the inside, and advised people to set up industries in Sichuan, which would be safer. Looking at it today, his views have merit.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Truck Ferry: Facilitating Transportation in Pudong; Site of Ferry Station Determined; Construction Expected Soon <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) In order to develop the ferry service on both sides of the Huangpu River, the Municipal Ferry Preparatory Office is preparing to operate a truck ferry. After on-site surveys along the river, it was determined that construction in the Nanshi area is most suitable. The following two wharves are available for construction: (1) The location of the Pudong ferry station is best on the riverside of Nanmatou Road. Most of the site of the ferry station there is public land owned by the city, which can be expanded in the future. The ground transportation of the parking lot can also be connected to Pudong Avenue. (2) The location of the Puxi ferry station is best along the riverside of Lujiabang Branch Road in Puxi, because the site along the coast is large and there are no important business engineering facilities. In order to speed up the progress, it is planned to cooperate with the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Equipment, materials, and ships will be provided by CRRRA. After the right to use the coastline and land is obtained, the Municipal Ferry Company will start construction, which is expected to be completed in two to three months. There are two design methods for the truck ferry terminal: (A) Using the Shanghai-style floating dock, that is, the ferry is parallel to the coastline, and vehicles use the approach bridge to land from the side of the ferry. (B) Building a fixed approach bridge or a movable drawbridge, with vehicles driving in from the bow or stern of the ferry. After discussion by experts, the latter method was considered to be more stable. However, although method A is not as convenient as method B, the equipment and materials can use CRRRA's existing materials, and it can be completed sooner. After this line is opened, the construction of more permanent ferry stations and ships will continue.</p>

<p>In order to strictly implement performance evaluation, the National Government issued a telegram stating: "The year-end performance evaluation of civil servants should be given equal importance as the regular assessment. This way, the judgment can be more accurate, and rewards and punishments can be fair. Since the restoration, there are many administrative tasks to be carried out.

It is reported that after receiving the order, the Executive Yuan has instructed all ministries and provincial and municipal governments. The Municipal Government of this city received this order a few days ago and immediately forwarded it to its subordinates for compliance.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) In August of this year, a man named Chen Yu, holding an official letter from the Jiangsu District Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, visited the person in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank in this city. The letter stated that the Commodity Tax Bureau was about to establish a branch office in Shanghai due to the heavy workload, and specially appointed Supervisor Chen Yu as the director of the office. Due to the urgent need for funds during the preparation period, the bank was requested to allocate 5 million yuan in advance, which would be returned by the Commodity Tax Bureau one week later. The bank, believing that the seals and official documents were correct, immediately allocated 5 million yuan in accordance with the letter, which Chen Yu took away. However, after a week, the Commodity Tax Bureau did not come to clear the loan, so the bank inquired with the bureau. As a result, the Commodity Tax Bureau had no plan to establish an office in Shanghai, and the above-mentioned seals and documents were all forged. The bank immediately sent letters to relevant firms and police authorities to pay attention to the arrest. At the beginning of this month, the owner of the Qianjiang Rongchang Match Factory was also defrauded of 2 million yuan by Chen using fraudulent means. On the 15th of this month, the owner of the factory obtained clues that Chen Yu was hiding in the Dongya Hotel in Shanghai. He made a special trip to Shanghai and reported the case to the police, who arrested Chen. Yesterday, the case was transferred by the police to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Native Cloth Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Native Cloth Trade Association of this city believes that native cloth is a major sideline industry in rural areas, and both the supply and demand sides are poor people. In 1928, the government issued an order to permanently exempt the industry from taxation. In 1932, the government issued another order to exempt all native cloth businesses from business tax. During the Anti-Japanese War, local areas were occupied, and native cloth production suffered a major blow. Transportation was blocked, and taxes were extremely heavy, so the sale and transport of native cloth nearly came to a complete halt. After the victory, the production and sale of native cloth need to be fostered and developed gradually. However, the government has issued a clear order to reimpose taxes, which has greatly affected the future of native cloth production. The association has repeatedly requested tax exemption in the past, but has not been approved. Now, the association has prepared a document to submit to the Municipal Finance Bureau of this city for submission to the Ministry of Finance as a final appeal.</p>

<p>I was extremely surprised to read the letter from the Nanshi District Wharf Transportation Industry Trade Union published in your newspaper on the 21st of this month. The incident in which Ge Axi and Li Shunsen, workers from Wenzhou at the Rihui Port Wharf, were injured by Shan Asi (Shan Saiquan) who gathered a crowd to attack them occurred at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. I went to Pudong on business in the early morning of that day and did not return until the next day. I did not know anything about the incident before or after it happened. The Nanshi District Trade Union has groundlessly slandered me, spreading false accusations, which is enough to confuse listeners. In addition to submitting a complaint to the competent authorities, I am sending this letter to request that you investigate and make corrections. Sincerely, Jiang Xueqin, Wenzhou worker at the Rihui Port Wharf.</p>

<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Coughing Up Blood Due to Lung Disease</p>
<p>Huang Weiqi asks: I am a 25-year-old unmarried male. At the age of 17, I suffered from hemoptysis. After repeated examinations by doctors, it was determined that my lungs were normal. At the age of 19, the old illness recurred. An X-ray revealed two dark spots on the apex of my right lung, diagnosed as hardened tuberculosis. However, I did not receive any treatment. Since then, every time I overworked, I coughed up about a bowl of blood. I have several questions and hope to get your answers: (1) How should this disease be treated? (2) My lesions were only discovered after I was over 20 years old, so I think that my lungs became diseased after I coughed up blood. From a medical point of view, is this possible? (3) How can I prevent hemoptysis? Have any drugs been invented to cure tuberculosis? (4) Which hemostatic injection is most effective? (5) Is there any hope of recovery from this disease?</p>
<p>(Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD): (1) Since the X-ray photos have diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis, you should receive active treatment, rest in bed, eat more nutritious food, undergo artificial pneumothorax, or inject glucose calcium and vitamin C, etc.; (2) Hemoptysis is a symptom of pulmonary tuberculosis. If it is completely cured, the hemoptysis will naturally stop; (3) The most important thing to prevent hemoptysis is to rest in bed and undergo artificial pneumothorax, as well as cough suppressants; (4) You can use cough suppressants such as Codein, etc., for hemoptysis, and hemostatic agents such as Coagulen, Clauden Phrombogen, etc. (5) There is hope of recovery, so be sure to receive active treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Combined Fistula in Ano</p>
<p>Wang Huimin asks: I have suffered from hemorrhoids for nine years. In the beginning, two nodules appeared on both the front and back of the anus, causing itching. After half a year, the nodules ruptured, and pus flowed out every day. Now, after a long time, the posterior one seems to have a hard root, and another one has grown on the left side of the anus. I have several questions and would like to ask for answers: (1) Is it a fistula in ano, and can it be cured? (2) How should this disease be treated? If surgery is unavoidable, is there any danger?</p>
<p>(Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD): (1) Based on the various statements in the letter, I am afraid it is a tuberculous fistula in ano; (2) You can first use an artificial sun lamp for irradiation, followed by packing with medicated gauze, once a day. If it does not heal after a long time, it can be treated with surgery. Local anesthesia is used, and there is no danger. At the same time, you must take various vitamin pills and other cod liver oil pills, blood tonics, etc. You can also inject glucose calcium and vitamin C, etc. Because it may be related to pulmonary tuberculosis, it is best to use X-ray fluoroscopy for diagnosis.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Speculators Fuel the Fire: Gold Prices Continue to Rise Yesterday; Central Bank is Conducting a Thorough Investigation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the buying market was again vibrant. The Central Bank's supply was limited, and the price surge rose again. It opened at around 2.605 million in the morning, and there was a scramble to buy immediately after opening, rising to 2.617 million. After that, it only hovered between around 2.61 million and 2.62 million. When the Central Bank allocated 60 bars at a price of 2.62 million, people's hearts moved again. The Central Bank, based on its flexible strategy, once again became stagnant, forming a situation of demand exceeding supply. It happened to be the weekend, and those who came to purchase and store for change came one after another. The market price gradually increased, and by noon it had risen to over 2.65 million. In the afternoon, the current transaction price rose to over 2.67 million, and then slightly fell back. As a result, it rose another 53,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry rose to 280,000, while silver and silver dollars remained flat. The black market discount was still between 10% and 15%.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Central Bank authorities have paid considerable attention to the recent fluctuations in gold prices. In addition to selling large quantities to curb the price surge, they are also thoroughly investigating speculators, especially closely monitoring the business of money shops. However, according to news from the financial sector, the rise in gold prices this time is purely caused by illegal merchants making waves. The gold reserves are sufficient and the supply channels are also very smooth. It is expected that the future will not be endless.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were also raised, but the rise was less pronounced. The black market for US dollars rose from 4,780 yuan to 4,830 yuan, then to 4,820 yuan to 4,870 yuan. As a result, it rose several tens of yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were also raised by ten yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were stimulated by gold and banknotes, and were passively prosperous. However, there were no actual sales, only the selling price was raised. Yesterday's price was 920 yuan to 940 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 1,105 yuan to 1,125 yuan. British exchange rates were 14,850 yuan to 14,950 yuan. There were very few buyers. US exchange rates remained the same.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Mayor Wu Speaks on the Issues of Oil and Yarn: Oil Merchants' Small Commission Still Under Consideration; No Permission Required for Exporting Surplus Yarn <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, reporters visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall and raised several questions related to cooking oil and cotton yarn. He kindly answered them separately as follows: (1) The recent stagnation of the oil market, will it affect the future of cooking oil in this city? Answer: This city's cooking oil is regularly supplied by national and private oil factories at 36,000 dan per month. In addition, with the cooking oil transported from other places by traders, the cooking oil available for distribution each month exceeds 50,000 dan. Therefore, the stable price supply of cooking oil in this city can be announced. However, intermediaries often exceed the negotiated price when buying and selling cooking oil in the market, so they were ordered to temporarily suspend the market. Therefore, the stagnation of the oil market will not affect the future of cooking oil in this city. (2) It is heard that the cooking oil intermediaries are asking the Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Allocation Office to give a small commission for the oil allocated by each factory. Is the Mayor willing to consider this? Answer: It is true that the intermediaries have no commission because each factory directly provides the joint allocation office for distribution. However, considering the interests they represent, they are only a minority, and the citizens who suffer from the black market transactions of intermediaries exceeding the negotiated price are the majority. The authorities' position is to maintain the welfare of the majority. The order to temporarily suspend transactions in the oil market this time is to prohibit black market cooking oil transactions and to make the intermediaries aware of the warning. Whether to allow a small commission is still under consideration. (3) It is heard that the Mayor has sent personnel to investigate the export of cotton yarn recently. Is this true? Answer: Yes, it is true. In order to prevent the export of cotton yarn in this city from being confused, it is necessary to send personnel to randomly check the export of yarn at any time. For example, the allocated yarn obtained by various guilds in the textile industry can only be used for the production of the textile industry itself. If there is any transfer to other places, it will be subject to investigation. (4) Do yarn factories also need to apply for permission in advance for the portion of yarn they freely sell to other places? Answer: Yarn factories must report and register the amount of yarn they freely sell to other places with the Textile Control Commission, and do not need to apply for an export license. (5) After the Textile Control Commission decided to allocate a portion of the yarn produced by each factory to old business associates of each factory in the Yarn Merchant Association, why is there still a lack of yarn opening from large factories in the yarn merchant market today (23rd)? Answer: Since the Textile Control Commission decided on this measure, each yarn factory is planning to hold a meeting to discuss how to take turns to open yarn on a daily basis. In short, the portion of cotton yarn that should be allocated to yarn merchants in the total monthly yarn production will be allocated completely one after another within a month. (6) In addition to handling the allocation of cotton yarn in this city, will the Textile Control Commission also handle it in the same way in other places? Answer: At present, the number of cotton yarn from this city sold to various places is quite large, so the first step will be to stabilize the yarn price in this city first, and the yarn prices in various places will also stabilize accordingly. After the supply of cotton yarn in this city is on the right track, we will then consider the distribution of cotton yarn in other places.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Securities Exchange had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, requesting instructions on the types of bonds to be designated for auction and the sample of the regulations. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the case had been forwarded to the Executive Yuan, which instructed that it "be discussed later."

<p>This year's export tea leaves, due to the exchange rate being only a thousand times that of the pre-war level, failed to maintain costs, resulting in delayed exports. Tea farmers and tea merchants have been in distress for a long time. Recently, as the end of the year is approaching, representatives from various production areas have gathered in Shanghai and held a meeting at the Shanghai Tea Industry Trade Association. It was decided to organize a petition group to purchase export tea, with the former members of the Promotion Committee as natural members, and Qian Liang, Cheng Yongyan, Ke Zhongzheng, Li Yuanzheng, and Han Junheng were added as members of the group. Shou Jingwei was elected as the head of the group, and Tang Jisan and Wu Juenong were elected as deputy heads. The funds will be temporarily set at a fee of 200 yuan per box, with half of the amount advanced by relevant companies and firms in advance. The petition group is scheduled to go to Beijing for a petition next week.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Indian Silk Sales: Price Must Be Discounted by 30%; Order Amount Too High <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] People in the silk industry say: Southeast Asia is a potential market for silk production, because that area has a great need for national silk, especially India is the most promising. India did not suffer losses during the war, and its purchasing power is very sufficient because it provided food and supplies for the British military. The prices in that area are also high, which is also conducive to the promotion of domestic goods. However, recently, the sales of domestic silk to India have encountered two difficulties: (1) India hopes that our country's silk can be discounted by 30%; (2) When Indian merchants order goods from silk factories, the amount of demand is very large, often exceeding the production capacity of domestic factories.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The yarn market, which had been stagnant for many days, had a slight transaction yesterday.

<p>The third phase and fourth allocation of yarn, undertaken by the yarn allocation committee of the cotton yarn replica industry association, was transferred and allocated by various industries under the association's system yesterday. Some members whose factories are located in other places have offices and sales offices in this city, and also use this city as a distribution center for purchasing and selling goods, and were also allocated yarn. This time, the Textile Control Commission approved that "those whose factories are located in other places are not within the scope of yarn allocation and do not need to continue to allocate." This time, it was suspended uniformly. Therefore, 11 representatives including Chi Laba factory, Wu Huancha of Jiangyin, Wang De of Wuxi, Zhu Chang of Jiangyin, and Xu Zhibin of Changshu came to Shanghai to request yarn allocation. They were scheduled to meet Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM today to complain that the black market in the inland is 30% higher than the allocated price, resulting in a special cost county that cannot survive. If it is not remedied, hundreds of cloth factories will see their businesses close. A certain gentleman in the textile supplies industry once built a spinning building. Foreign factories were allocated goods on a continuing basis. Authorities are considering whether to continue shipping from other stations.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Application by Oil Merchants – Granted Freedom of Trade within Negotiated Price Range <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Over thirty representatives from the wholesale, retail, and distribution sectors of edible oil in the city held a discussion yesterday at 3:30 PM at the Grains, Oil, and Oilcake Trade Association. The meeting, chaired by Zhang Chao, adjourned around 5:00 PM. It was decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow to allow the edible oil market to resume free trade within the negotiated price range. Simultaneously, the Grains Association will submit the names of buyers, sellers, and brokers to the Social Affairs Bureau. Furthermore, daily arrivals of edible oil from various regions must also be registered with the market for reporting purposes.</p>
<p>The oil market remained closed yesterday. However, merchants from Hankou shipped 500 dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) of sesame oil, which was entrusted to the Joint Allocation Office for distribution. It is anticipated that distribution to retail stores will commence tomorrow. The 200 dan of North China raw oil entrusted to the Joint Allocation Office by merchants the day before yesterday began distribution yesterday. Additionally, there are over 800 dan of green oil lacking distribution channels. Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Joint Allocation Office, has negotiated with over forty other wholesale oil merchants to allocate 20 zu (a grouping of units) to each, for distribution to the fried dough stick and flatbread industry. Yesterday, private factories allocated 500 dan of edible oil to the Joint Allocation Office, which then distributed it to 142 retail stores in the northern district. The allocation quota for each factory remains the same as before.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the local Rice Brokers Association, concerned about the lack of commissions for brokers due to private factories directly allocating oil to retail merchants through the Joint Allocation Office, which endangers their livelihoods, sent a letter to the Joint Allocation Office requesting a small commission be allocated from the distributed goods to sustain the livelihoods of the brokers. The Joint Allocation Office, deeming this matter related to changing the negotiated price, did not dare to make a decision. They will report the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and instruction.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stimulated by news reports of multiple bullish (buying) companies, boosting sentiment. A stockbroker named Yang had a bullish position in Evergreen Cotton Yarn, holding it for a long time. However, continuous selling pressure from Guangdong dealers ultimately led to a surplus of shares, overwhelming buyers and causing a devastating collapse near closing. At the opening, all stocks showed a strong upward trend, attracting numerous retail investors. Some even switched from short (selling) to long (buying) positions. One-Five-One company aggressively bought Evergreen Cotton Yarn, displaying a strong bullish stance, leading the off-market price to exceed the on-market price. Guangdong dealers took advantage of the high price, continuously supplying Evergreen Cotton Yarn, causing the market price to initially rise and then gradually decline. However, Yang's position, alternating between long and short, faced prolonged contention. From 11:30 AM onwards, the market showed a strong downward trend, leading to a disastrous collapse near noon and significant losses. Only Xinyi Company, with No. 38 covering short positions, remained relatively stable with minimal losses. Near closing, under short-covering pressure, there was a slight rebound, but investor sentiment remained panicked, preventing significant recovery. Consequently, Evergreen Cotton Yarn, Maya, Evergreen Public, Jingfu, Xinguanghua stock prices decreased slightly compared to the previous closing, Xinyi remained unchanged, and Qinxing rose by half a percent. Many unpopular stocks had no trades. Rongyu, Xinya, and Annei slightly increased, while the remaining stocks declined slightly. In after-hours trading, Evergreen Cotton Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang slightly declined, Maya remained unchanged, and Qinxing, Huafeng, and Xinyi slightly increased. Off-market stock prices continued to decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw further gains in gold and banknotes. Buyers actively engaged, seeing lower prices. Starting from lows, they rose. Compared to the previous closing, Yeguang and Gangye each rose by more than 10%, the British Federation of Trade Unions and the German Association rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.</p>

<p>The rice market saw total arrivals of over 14,000 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice from the north and south, mainly japonica rice, especially southern japonica. Indica rice arrivals were fewer. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice arrivals were not strong. Market trends fluctuated. Southern japonica rice fell by 1,000 yuan, and northern japonica fell by 300-500 yuan.

Green beans had very few trades, while mung beans were sluggish. Red beans increased by 300-500 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia remained unchanged, continuing to fall by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from foreign traders were slightly accepted at higher prices, while secondary grades lacked transactions. Edible oil continued to be distributed through the market, but with a large number of registered retailers, totaling over 1,000, universal distribution was not easy in the short term. Raw oil and soybean oil were scarce and remained firm, sesame oil was stable, and red sorghum rebounded by 200-300 yuan.</p>

<p>The coal market saw strong sales of bituminous coal lumps and coal dust. User demand was increasingly strong. The market was filled with buying orders, and prices climbed steadily. All goods reached new highs, with Kaiping No. 2 dust being the most popular. The bituminous coal lump market was relatively stable, and transactions were active.

<p>The foreign tea market saw many traders continuously selling due to general financial constraints. Although buyers took the opportunity to push prices down, the selling price of this year's new tea crop was surprisingly high. Most old tea did not meet demand, so purchases were weak. By the end of the trading day, activity had not increased. However, 1945 high-grade old Keemun tea held by major dealers did not easily sell due to its scarcity, maintaining its firm price. Domestic sales of red and green tea were sluggish in stores and among traveling merchants. Investor sentiment was stable.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Black and White basketball team played its sixth game in Shanghai last night, facing the Hua Lian team, the league champion of this city. As a result of the fierce battle, Black and White were defeated with a score of 44 to 36. In the first half, Hua Lian took the lead with a score of 24 to 16. After Hua Lian led seven to six, they maintained the lead all the way, and Black and White were always in a pursuing position. Except for a slight competition in the first quarter, the game was filled with fouls, and as many as three Black and White players were fouled out, greatly reducing the excitement of the game. Cai Wenhua and Wu Chengzhang of Hua Lian scored the most points, and their performance was also quite outstanding. Last night's audience was estimated to be more than two thousand people, which was the first grand occasion for the visiting team to play in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fouls Accumulate Greatly Reducing Excitement</p>
<p>The Black and White team's starting lineup yesterday was Chuan Yongxin, Shen Renshou, Cai Jindian, Guo Guoye, and Ye Kexi. Hua Lian countered with Li Zhenzhong, Cai Wenhua, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Zhang Yuyi. Referees Zheng Zhifang and Wu Zibin blew the whistle to start the game. Guo Guoye committed a foul, and "Adi" Wu Chengzhang scored the first point with a free throw. Chuan Yongxin made one free throw, and Shen Renshou made one shot, giving Black and White a 3-1 lead. They then led 6-3. Chengzhang broke through, and Da Li scored, putting Hua Lian ahead 7-6. Wenhua and Songyuan scored two shots, making it 11-6. Black and White substituted Lin Ziyi and Xu Yinzhen for Shen Renshou and Guo Guoye. When Songyuan scored, the first quarter ended with Hua Lian leading Black and White 14-7. In the next quarter, when the score was 20-12, Ren Xiangcheng replaced Bao Songyuan. At this time, both sides committed many fouls, and each scored points with free throws. Hua Lian substituted Xue Chong for Zhenzhong and re-entered Songyuan, replacing Yuyi. The first half ended with Hua Lian leading 24-16.</p>
<p>Black and White Generals Fouled Out One After Another</p>
<p>After the break, Guo Guoye of Black and White fouled out after committing five fouls, and Xu Yinzhen entered the court. The score was 20-26. Black and White could have caught up in time, but they repeatedly made substitutions, resulting in nothing being accomplished. Ye Kexi was also judged off the court for his rude behavior, and the morale of the team was even more scattered. Wenhua and Chengzhang scored repeatedly, making the third quarter score 35-20, a difference of fifteen points. In the last quarter, Zhang Sai replaced Chen Xuechong. Cai Jin of Black and White and both teams scored. When the score was 47-28, Jin Xiangren was called down, and Bao Songyuan and Zhang Liangxiong joined the battle. Soon, Shen Renshou was also fouled out after committing five fouls, and Lin Ziyi entered the court. Hua Lian's play gradually became relaxed.

<h3 id="e161">The Nine-Headed Bird on the American Political Stage: Wallace Becomes a Cultural Figure <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York Airmail, 17th</p>
<p>Wallace is truly an utter "eccentric" in the ups and downs of American politics. Many Americans simply cannot understand Wallace's thoughts and actions. Sometimes he is very naive, dancing for joy when he sees the cheers of the crowd. Sometimes he is very heavy, instantly casting a layer of gloom over the entire political atmosphere. Nowadays, in the United States, apart from the Communist Party constantly shouting "workers," most workers regard Wallace as their true friend. However, he himself comes from a large manor landowner background in the Midwest. It is said that the inheritance Wallace received from his ancestors is considerable. Therefore, Wallace has never experienced the hardships and bitterness of the world in his life. Wallace himself is still able to maintain a bit of "naiveté" on the political stage, which is entirely due to his environment.</p>
<p>Wallace Portrayed in Women's Clothing</p>
<p>The day the Secretary of Commerce was forced to resign, Wallace became the focus of national attention. Judging from the attitude of the New York news media that I saw: among the dozen or so morning and evening newspapers in the city, apart from the Communist "Daily Worker" and Marshall Field's "Afternoon News" supporting and sympathizing with Wallace, and the "Daily Post" being relatively neutral, all other newspapers, large and small, denounced Wallace's absurd speech. The day before his resignation, Wallace entered the White House and met with President Truman. They talked for three hours, and it was once rumored that a compromise had been reached. The content of the compromise was: Wallace would not make speeches attacking foreign policy until the Paris Peace Conference closed. Wallace himself would still be a member of the cabinet and continue to serve as the US Secretary of Commerce. When this news reached New York, the "Daily News," the newspaper with the largest circulation in New York, wrote an editorial that day titled "President, We Are Disappointed in You!" It said: Wallace is the most despicable prostitute on the American political stage, selling himself to red fascists. It also said: "If the President keeps Wallace in the cabinet, he will lose the government's credibility and disappoint patriotic Americans in the Democratic Party government." It also drew a cartoon, portraying Wallace in women's clothing, "leaning on the door and smiling," with Marshal Stalin holding a panda gun and passing by with his head held high.</p>
<p>The next day, President Truman forced Wallace to resign by telephone. New York newspapers all used the words "kicked out" as headlines. The reason for the expulsion is still a secret. Reporters inside and outside the White House are convinced that it was the influence of a long-distance call from Paris. However, Byrnes replied to reporters in Paris that he had not coerced President Truman to expel Wallace at all. This is a very interesting open and covert struggle between the three giants of the Democratic Party, just like the situation of Trotsky, Stalin, and Bukharin in those years. However, one is a democratic country, and the other is an oligarchic country. Therefore, the methods of political struggle used are different, and the results of the struggle are also different.</p>
<p>Led the Left Wing Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>If we want to trace this case back, we must go back to the Democratic National Convention in the winter of 1944. At that time, Wallace's left wing (labor groups and new liberals) and Byrnes' right wing argued endlessly over the vice presidential issue. At that time, President Roosevelt was still alive. He did not attend the "National Convention," and his speech was read on his behalf, saying in essence: Regarding the issue of electing candidates, he hoped to be the same as in 1940. This meant that he hoped Wallace would be re-elected. However, in another telegram, he also congratulated Byrnes on his efforts and hoped that he would be elected. This was Roosevelt's clever use of "impartiality" that year. Later, the stalemate was broken, and several behind-the-scenes bosses in the party pulled out the relatively neutral and stable Truman. Unexpectedly, Roosevelt died during that term, and the cracks in the Democratic Party itself were completely exposed.</p>
<p>I am not prepared to recount those materials in detail. Three months ago, I reported to this newspaper very early on the premonitions of the Democratic Party's split, which was long before the Wallace incident occurred. On the day Wallace resigned, New York newspapers spared no effort in sarcasm and ridicule. The New York Daily Mirror published a cover photo of Wallace with the words: "An unemployed person." Many people predicted that Wallace would organize a third major political party, because some labor groups in the United States, such as the most powerful CIO (Chinese translation: Shih Ai'ao Trade Union), were strong supporters of Wallace.</p>
<p>Daughter Jenny Gets Married</p>
<p>However, Wallace did not do so. After handing over the Secretary of Commerce, Wallace moved to the Wardman Park Apartments, which is a fairly quiet place in Washington. The apartments are surrounded by large lawns, well-maintained gardens, and a swimming pool and tennis court in the back. Wallace's family lived so quietly, as if they were detached from the secular world.</p>
<p>Reporters from various countries have visited him at the Wardman Apartments. He said: He was very busy with his daughter Miss Jenny's wedding. He said: Although he had resigned, he had to keep his promise: not to make any speeches criticizing foreign policy until the Paris Peace Conference ended. Miss Jenny's wedding was very simple. The First Lady attended that day, but President Truman did not attend. An amusing colleague asked President Truman afterwards, and the President replied very casually: "Attend the wedding? I've never done that in my life."</p>
<p>Old Aides Resign One After Another</p>
<p>"A new emperor brings new officials." There have also been some changes in the staff of the Department of Commerce. Chief Secretary Han Luyang has always been an old aide of Wallace. He resigned along with the Minister. He is now revitalizing his career in Washington and has put up his lawyer's sign again. The new Minister, upon taking office, first announced that personnel would not be changed across the board. However, some mid-level cadres still resigned one after another. Many people changed careers and joined the business community. These people were not "loyal" to the former Minister, but rather because the salaries of civil servants were too low, while the treatment in the business community was "too good."</p>
<p>Relies on Ancestral Property to Earn 50,000 a Year</p>
<p>Wallace himself is not in a hurry to find a way out. The New York "Daily News" reporter in Washington said: Wallace can receive 50,000 yuan in interest or rent per year relying on his ancestors' inheritance (including movable and immovable property). Therefore, he does not seek anything from anyone. That reporter said: He has political ambitions - the "Presidential Dream" of 1948.</p>
<p>Extolls the Two-Party System</p>
<p>I dare not assert that he does not have a presidential dream? I feel that the political routines and political morality of democratic countries are very lovely. Wallace was expelled by the Democratic Party government. However, on the eve of the general election, Wallace still worked hard for the Democratic Party. In any case, in the campaign arena, the Democratic Party needs Wallace. Through Wallace's so-called left wing, the Democratic Party can obtain the cooperation of the "Labor Party" and "Liberal Party" factions. For example, in this New York State election, Mead is the Democratic candidate for governor, as well as the joint candidate of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, and Democratic Party. Lehman is the Democratic candidate for senator, and also the candidate of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, and Democratic Party. One day more than a month before his resignation, I heard Wallace's speech at the Commodore Hotel. He praised the two-party system, saying: "Only the two-party system can truly follow the constitutional routine."</p>
<p>Two-Week Traveling Lecture Tour</p>
<p>Last month, it was widely rumored in Washington that Byrnes was about to resign, and even people in the State Department believed that their Secretary of State might resign. On the other hand, Wallace's two-week traveling lecture tour was to greatly promote the Democratic Party. Wallace planned to go to Indiana and Michigan first, then to California and Washington in the west, then to Minnesota and Wisconsin, and finally rush back to New York on the eve of the election. The Republican Party's rhetoric, as well as non-partisan people who oppose the "New Economic Policy" factions, began to attack Wallace again.</p>
<p>During the days when the "pork panic" was most severe, a Republican Congressman, Giggins of Ohio, scolded Wallace in Congress, saying: "Why don't the American people have meat to eat now? To get to the root of the problem, we must trace it back to Wallace, this dangerous communist, who has set up that set of controls." That Congressman even compared Wallace to a demon.</p>
<p>Resumes Career as Editor</p>
<p>Now what? Wallace has officially been hired as the editor of the "New Republic" magazine. The editing contract starts on December 16. He is joining the ranks of American cultural figures with great excitement. Thirteen years ago, he ran a very naive rural publication in Iowa. After thirteen years, he decided to resume his writing career.</p>
<p>This is a news item that contains "extraordinary" in the ordinary. The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times both wrote editorials for Wallace. The New York Times wrote: The New Republic magazine is a prestigious publication in the United States. It is known for its left-leaning stance and advocates new economic systems, but it does not take orders from Moscow. This is in line with Mr. Wallace's interests. Since Mr. Wallace disagrees with the current government's foreign policy, it is appropriate for him not to remain in the cabinet. Now that Mr. Wallace has retired from the government and accepted the editorial position in a free capacity, he can fully display his strengths. "In our democratic country, we hope that Mr. Wallace will make full use of his insightful opinions and express his sincere dedication to world peace."</p>
<p>The New York Herald Tribune's editorial said: "Mr. Wallace's appointment as editor of the New Republic magazine can be said to be the right person in the right place." More than ten years ago, Mr. Wallace participated in the press and joined the cultural industry. Mr. Wallace has a talent for criticism and is able to persuade a wide range of troops. It is hoped that he will display this "critical spirit" in the future "New Republic Magazine." Then, the Herald Tribune also said: "Having more than two different foreign policy opinions in the same cabinet will undoubtedly weaken the international standing of American diplomacy. Therefore, it is appropriate for Mr. Wallace to withdraw from the cabinet." "The New Republic magazine is a publication called Neo-Liberalism, which has always supported Roosevelt's New Deal, which is in line with Mr. Wallace's taste." The Herald Tribune concluded, like the Times, hoping that he would do a good job and express his famous opinions.</p>
<p>In the United States, the New Republic magazine does not have a large circulation. It has no pictures or photos, and no advertisements. The printing is very dull, and the paper is very rough. However, its content has a considerable impact on domestic and foreign affairs. The founder of the New Republic magazine was Straight, who founded it in 1914. The first editor was Crowley. It supported Roosevelt's New Deal and was originally close to the left wing of the Democratic Party. In the United States, many self-proclaimed progressive and enlightened liberals are often shocked by the articles in the New Republic magazine, because the New Republic magazine is more "progressive" than them, and even more "free"!</p>
<h3 id="e162">Visiting Jiaozuo <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Our correspondent in Bian, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>Dispatch from the 13th</p>
<p>Jiaozuo is the "Little Shanghai" of Henan. It was originally a town in Xiuwu County, but its rich coal production gave it a special character. The coal production made it prosperous – it once had hundreds of thousands of residents, thriving commerce, and a wealthy population! And because of the power of coal itself, it is even more important today. It was "taken over" by the Communist army on September 2nd of last year, and the Daoqing Railway was also completely destroyed at the same time.</p>
<p>Following Yu East, Yu North was also engulfed in war. Since mid-August, under the command of Liu Bocheng, the Communist army mobilized twenty-eight regiments from the Taihang Military Region to besiege Huixian City, defended by General Li Zhenxi. Yu North, a land that was very important during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties – Xiuwu County was originally called Ning, and when King Wu of Zhou attacked Zhou, he "stationed troops in Ning," and changed "Ning" to Xiuwu – has been filled with the clouds of war ever since. Jiaozuo was recaptured by the Nationalist army at 12:00 AM on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Built Strong Fortifications on the Outskirts of Jiaozuo</p>
<p>The recapture of Jiaozuo was both expected and unexpected – no one thought it would be so fast! The Communists certainly did not expect to lose Jiaozuo so quickly, or they would have thoroughly destroyed it. Since September of last year, the Communist army had been moving things from Jiaozuo to their old base in the Taihang Mountains, knowing that they would not be able to stay in Jiaozuo for long.</p>
<p>The Communist army built solid fortifications in some places on the outskirts of Jiaozuo, such as Wulipu, Jincun, Huocun, and Daiwangzhai (the place where people waited for King Wu of Zhou) before and after Xiazhuang, and they used the materials from the Daoqing Road that they had destroyed to make bunkers and moats, which took a lot of effort and manpower! However, the Communist army's Maginot Line of defense was not used, and Jiaozuo was recaptured by the Nationalist army.</p>
<p>Nationalist Army's Main Force Carried out a Flanking Maneuver, Occupying the Coal Mine Hilltops</p>
<p>The Nationalist 32nd Division, an army trained by General Shang Zhen, known for their polo skills, recaptured Jiaozuo. The division commander, General Tang Yongliang, not only loved riding horses but was also excellent at painting them. Under the command of General Wang Zhonglian, he carried out the battle to recapture Jiaozuo. On October 11th, his troops confronted the Communist army in Daiwangzhai and other places. At night, he transferred his main force to the flank, flanking the Communist army's rear, "avoiding strength and attacking weakness," and occupied the hilltops of the coal mines, and occupied Jiaozuo, in order to avoid sacrifices, and more importantly, to prevent the Communist army from destroying the coal mines like other coal mines, so that the entire Henan would be oppressed by coal, and there would be a coal shortage everywhere.</p>
<p>Jiaozuo, the "Little Shanghai" of Henan, is no longer what it used to be. Under the Communist regime, workers could not bear the oppression, farmers could not withstand the conscription, merchants could not endure the struggle, and residents were subjected to the "turn-over movement" of local hoodlums and rogue "proletariat" "revolutionary fighters," some died, some fled, and the population of hundreds of thousands is now only one or two tens of thousands. How could it not wither like a flower?</p>
<p>Machinery Not Greatly Damaged, Mining to Resume in Short Term</p>
<p>The Wangfeng, Lidui, No. 39 wells, and many smaller mines with scale, no longer had their past production under the Communist Party's destruction. Now they are all filled with water. The army is cooperating with the mine leaders to carry out the work of restoring the mine. Fortunately, the machinery is not greatly damaged, and mining can be started in the short term.</p>
<p>After the recapture of Jiaozuo, telecommunications personnel and the post office quickly began their work. The post office started receiving letters on the third day after the recapture. The Agricultural Bank also sent personnel to carry out the work of resuming loans. The Appeasement Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Relief Sub-Bureau also sent personnel to inspect – the work of restoration is underway.</p>
<p>Jiaozuo is a place that has undergone the Communist Party's "revolution" test. In the hands of the Communist Party, it is heading towards decline and a miserable situation day by day. When will it be able to recover? All the phenomena here are "heartbreaking and heartbreaking, and it is sad and difficult to look back!"</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Building Daoqing Road, Revitalizing the Artery of Yu North</p>
<p>People, supporting the old and leading the young, are returning here in an endless stream. They have to walk through the destroyed villages and towns, the barren fields, and greet the villagers with their faces of vegetables, what is the taste in their hearts!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Railway Bureau to carry out the work of rebuilding the Daoqing Road. It is hoped that the road can be built quickly so that the land and people of Yu North can be revived by relying on this artery.</p>
<p>What the Communist army left to the land and people of Yu North is pain. How should the border currency be dealt with? Land issues, property issues, etc., hopefully, there will be quick and proper solutions.</p>
<p>Perceptions of the PingSui and PingHan Lines</p>
<p>Finally, Commander Sun said about his perceptions of the PingSui and PingHan lines during his inspection over the past two months: seeing the suffering of the people in various places, he felt more and more the lovability of the people. In all the places that had been occupied by the Communist army, many county magistrates and public education personnel sent by the government were killed, and even the poor people who had worked for the government were assassinated by the Communist army at night. The terror created by the Communist army in various places has made it impossible for the people to live in peace. Conscription and extortion made it impossible for the people to survive. The Communist army's requisition of grain in various places even went so far as to ask the people for the grain tax of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The shops were also all controlled and run by the Communist army. The people said that everything was done for them.</p>
<p>When Commander Sun returned from Tangshan, the reporter interviewed him again at the station. He said that in order to strengthen the local security in Ji East, it has been decided to set up a joint office of the Party, government, military, and civilians under the Ji East Appeasement Headquarters, which can avoid the past scattered situation. During this trip to Tangshan, Sun also decided to deploy powerful troops outside Beining Road, and the line of defense work focused on strengthening the people's organization. He believes that without this, the safety of transportation cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Record of Talks with Sun Lianzhong <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Our Tianjin Special Correspondent Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Dispatch from the 5th</p>
<p>Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the 11th War Zone, came to Tianjin from Beiping yesterday, and went to Tangshan from Tianjin once, and returned to Ping via Jin from Tangshan on the 4th. When Commander Sun decided to come to Tianjin, the reporter saw him twice, the first time when he first arrived, at his temporary residence, and the second time when he returned from Tangshan, meeting in the car.</p>
<p>The first visit was very long and covered a wide range of issues. That day happened to be the day when the Nationalist army cleared the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, but the news of the meeting had not yet spread. When the reporter asked about this issue, Commander Sun replied, "It has already been cleared today." The reporter asked, "Will the Communist army launch another offensive in Hebei Province?" His answer was very relaxed. He said, "There is no question of any offensive, but the weather is cold, and the Communist army will inevitably harass the plains from the mountains, but it will not form any problem." In terms of military affairs, when talking about the Communist army's siege of Yulin in northern Shaanxi, Sun said that the safety of Yulin was not a problem, and the Communist army's actions were just harassment. Speaking of the situation in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, Commander Sun described the Communist army's destruction along the line in great detail. He said: In Dingxing, Beixinhe, Gaobeidian, and other places, when the Communist army retreated, not only were public buildings destroyed, but also schools and civilian houses.</p>
<p>On the administrative side of Hebei Province, the reporter first asked about the local order and the implementation of government orders in various places. Sun said: The local order is not yet good, but it is gradually recovering, and the implementation of government orders is the same. In places that have been occupied by the Communist army for a long time, the implementation of government orders may not be universally implemented, but it is only a matter of time before it gets on track.</p>
<p>The topic fell on the refugees, emphasizing the work of organizing and training the people</p>
<p>The reporter asked Commander Sun: How is the government promoting the land policy in the recovered areas? He said: The provincial government had already formulated a plan for land consolidation in the recovered areas, and it is now being gradually implemented, and there are no difficulties. Most of the farmers in Hebei Province are middle-class families, with each household generally cultivating only seventy or eighty acres of land, and their lives are generally stable. When asked about the relief work for the refugees in the recovered areas, Commander Sun said: Wherever government orders have been reached, the Aftermath Relief Administration has sent people to handle the relief work. Sun analyzed the refugees at this time and said: "The refugees who have a way have already run to Pingjin to take refuge. Most of those who stay behind are poor and helpless farmers, and they are the ones who can help us the most. They rely on them to help with road repairs, bridge building, and transporting wounded soldiers, etc." I said: Helping these refugees through the winter and helping them so that the spring plowing will not be delayed due to the war should be a major issue at present. Commander Sun said: "In addition to providing relief through work, we are already trying to settle the old, weak, women, and children, and there is no problem with spring plowing next year. The people can safely cultivate in the fields."</p>
<p>The topic continued on the refugees. I asked again whether the government would assist the refugees in demanding armed return to their hometowns. Commander Sun replied that the government naturally hopes that the refugees can return to their hometowns as soon as possible and live and work in peace, but he believes that the local defense should be actively cooperated with by the local people. He cited Ding County as an example and said that there was no right-wing Nationalist army defending there, but the people had strict organizations and training, and had their own constructed fortifications, so although the Communist army besieged it for three months, it was unable to capture it in the end. This fact has made the people in that area deeply feel the importance of organization and training. Later, when talking about the education recovery situation in Hebei Province, Commander Sun said that the annual expenditure of the entire Hebei Province is 5.3 billion yuan, and education expenses only account for a part of it, but the schools in various places have suffered heavy damage, and it often costs hundreds of millions of yuan to repair them slightly, which makes funding quite difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Scenes of Hong Kong <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Nanyang Traveling Correspondent, Qiu Ai</p>
<p>Dispatch from Hong Kong on the 19th</p>
<p>After five years of separation, the appearance of Hong Kong is still the same, but the losses during the war, the difficulty of transportation after the war, and the strict control have made the performance of the Hong Kong market significantly different from before the war.</p>
<p>Banks are Abundant</p>
<p>Before the war, the banking industry in Hong Kong was not very developed. After the war, in addition to the resumption of business by the original banks, new banks such as the China Farmers' Bank, Southwest Industrial Development Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Overseas Chinese United Bank, Zhenghe Bank, and Sichuan Salt Bank were opened; banks such as Kunming Commercial Bank are about to open, and countless large and small newly established companies and foreign firms are even more numerous. In the country, because the currency value is unstable, the interest rate on the market is very high, one-tenth or two-tenths interest is very common, that is, bank deposits can also get five or six tenths. In Hong Kong, because the currency value is relatively stable (in fact, it has been devalued), most bank deposits do not have interest, and even if they do, it is only one or two percent per annum. Due to the spread of civil war and the heavy burden of life, the propertied class in the country has flocked to Hong Kong. These people brought floating capital, there is no way out, some people organize banks, some people engage in import and export trade. Recently, because the population has increased sharply, the problem of housing shortage has become more and more serious, and some wealthy businessmen plan to engage in the purchase and construction of real estate. For example, Marina House on Queen's Road, someone plans to add three floors on the roof, which will cost about one million Hong Kong dollars, but the roof fee obtained from these three floors in the future will be more than one million yuan, and it must be paid in advance.</p>
<p>With the increase in banks, the number of silver houses engaged in gold and silver trading has also increased proportionally. Some of the larger silver houses even set up private radio stations, constantly contacting Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other major cities. In this period of volatile financial market, a piece of news can earn huge profits just ten minutes earlier than others. Merchants value profits and disregard the law, and sometimes it is common for them to be busted by the military police for setting up private radio stations.</p>
<p>Aviation is Developed</p>
<p>Maritime transportation in Hong Kong has not fully recovered, but the aviation industry has developed more than before, and the number of flights has also increased. In addition to China and Central Airlines, which specialize in connecting Hong Kong with major cities in China, Eastern, Trans-Asia, and Commercial Airlines specialize in flying to Hong Kong and various parts of Nanyang, Philippine Airlines flies between Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu, and British Overseas Airways flies between Hong Kong and London. Air France has an office in Hong Kong; however, its current route only runs from Paris to Saigon, and the section from Saigon to Hong Kong must be handled by British aircraft. Pan American Airlines flies from San Francisco through the Pacific Islands to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong to Yangon, Calcutta, and then transfers to another aircraft, flying directly to Europe, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to reach the United States. This global flight business can begin in December. The most interesting thing is that there will be shipping between Hong Kong and Langmen, leaving early and returning late every day, and the one-way trip only takes twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Due to the development of aviation, the airport in Hong Kong has become a problem. The Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon City, first, has large mountains nearby, and second, the runway is too short to adapt to this aviation era, so the construction of a large-scale new airport has become the most concerned issue for the Hong Kong government, major airlines, and the general public.</p>
<p>Initially, the Hong Kong government planned to build the Ping Shan Airport, but later it was said that the airport did not meet international civil aviation standards, and at the same time, because the Chinese government and people unanimously opposed it, the plan for the Ping Shan Airport was abandoned on April 3 of this year.</p>
<p>The second plan is to build a modern airport in Deep Water Bay, with a construction budget of 4 million pounds. The construction project of this airport is quite large, first, the landmines will blast off four million cubic yards of granite, and then use these crushed stones to repair the coast of West Deep Water Bay. The airport has two runways, each 3,000 yards long. It is now scheduled to start construction in January next year, and the entire project can be completed by the end of the year after (1948).</p>
<p>Gold is Active</p>
<p>Although the use of banknotes and checks has a long history, people still have a different view of the shiny, tangible gold.</p>
<p>As of the end of October, no less than 100,000 taels of gold have flowed into the Hong Kong market from foreign countries. This gold comes from Mexico. During the war, the raw materials purchased by the United States from Mexico were mostly paid for in gold, calculated at US$35 per tael. After the war, some Hong Kong merchants with long sleeves and good dancing skills ordered from Mexico at US$41 per tael, plus handling fees and insurance, totaling US$44 per tael.</p>
<p>Banks and silver houses that ordered Mexican gold made a lot of money. Gold, which originally cost only 44 yuan, can be sold on the spot for US$60, with a net profit of 50%. Brokers who run to Guangzhou can earn another 10% to 15% profit. In other words, people in China who buy gold pay 60% more than the original price. However, the national currency is depreciating every day, so who can stop people from buying gold at all costs instead of storing the national currency?</p>
<p>Merchants are really clear-headed, one turnover is money. With money, not only the arrogant sister-in-law of Su Qin has to be respectful, but also the international stage of maneuvering and horizontal unionism has not been using monetary diplomacy?</p>
<p>American Goods are Flooding</p>
<p>Hong Kong was occupied by Japan for three years and eight months. This short period of separation made the general public not know what the situation outside was like. On this day last year, merchants who got there first transported a batch of American goods to Hong Kong, making ten times the profit. For example, medicines that originally cost US$1 were sold for HK$200. Fountain pens that originally cost US$15 were also sold for HK$200. Although the Hong Kong government strictly controls imports and suppresses smuggling, British goods are slow to arrive, but American goods are becoming more and more numerous. Recently, the American strike problem was solved, and freighters full of cheap and high-quality goods will arrive in an endless stream. This problem has made merchants who hoard American goods at high prices anxious like ants on a hot pot.</p>
<p>A few months ago, many merchants ordered goods from American companies and foreign firms. Due to maritime transportation, the goods have not yet arrived. These merchants see that American goods in Hong Kong are about to reach the saturation point, so there are many people who have been asking import and export foreign firms to refund the deposit recently.</p>
<p>Now, the major companies and all foreign goods stores, Western medicine stores, and watch stores in Hong Kong are full of American equipment, and even the streets and alleys are piled up with various American goods. Every time I pass under the arcade of the Chinese Merchants Bank, I always hear hawkers shouting loudly: "American matches, three big packs for one yuan, can be used as firewood." "American pencils, five for one yuan, cheaper than firewood at the official price." At present, there are not as many new American cars in Hong Kong as in Shanghai, but wealthy businessmen who can communicate with gods with money can soon fill the roads of Hong Kong and Kowloon with American cars.</p>
<p>To be honest, the momentum of American goods is much fiercer than that of Japanese goods in the past. The only good thing about Japanese goods is that they are cheap, but the quality is poor and the types are limited. American goods are not only good and cheap, but also have endless patterns, from military supplies to necessities, from new-style glass products to various cosmetics, everything is available. In addition, in the past, Chinese people felt uncomfortable buying Japanese goods, but now Chinese people, and even people from all over the world, feel honored to buy American goods. This kind of spiritual disarmament has a really big impact on the market.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Talking about "Catching Ghosts" <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>A Farce Full of Irony</p>
<p>The purpose of a farce is simply to make the audience laugh constantly. Therefore, its content cannot be separated from sarcasm and satire.</p>
<p>Wu Zuguang boldly used a new method to finish this farce "Catching Ghosts." He pulled the ancient all the way to the modern, in order to explain: Zhong Kui got drunk and slept for a thousand years. In the thousand years, he never caught ghosts, so the world has become a world of ghosts.</p>
<p>There is no story in "Catching Ghosts," and if there is, it is very simple: Zhong Kui was the top scholar, but he was not hired because of his ugly appearance, and he bumped to death in the palace hall. The King of Hell in the underworld named him the Great God of Catching Ghosts. He went to the Yang world to catch ghosts successfully, got drunk and slept for a thousand years; when he woke up, the Yang world had become a world of ghosts. However, the author interspersed a lot of good materials in this simple story, which made this play a lot better.</p>
<p>The theme of this play is not in the story itself, but in the interesting interspersions. It is to expose and reveal the baseness and shamelessness of officials to the world. It clearly points out the philosophy of life of women, and even more clearly points out that rich young masters are drunk and lustful and prepare to be ghosts under the peony flowers. It also tells of the rampant illegality of local tyrants and gentry, and the repeated bullying of ordinary people. In terms of meaning, this play extremely exposes the darkness of all classes; in terms of form, it also fulfills its purpose of making the audience laugh.</p>
<p>Interspersing things from two old plays in the play does not appear to be obtrusive here, but feels powerful. For example, when General Qi took the stage with a knife, it made me think that this imposter general was an imposter after all, and even the set of airs of being an official was not like it. At the same time, it also made me think that being an official is just acting!</p>
<p>There is one thing that the playwright of this play should be responsible for, that is: the component of laughter is heavier in the first two scenes than in the later scenes, which makes people feel top-heavy. Perhaps the director did not reduce the component of laughter in the front, nor did he particularly increase the component in the back. That's why people have this feeling. Otherwise, the audience would leave the theater more satisfied.</p>
<p>The director made the actors move around to change the picture, and the introduction of the main actors on stage is very obvious. He has already achieved: if a member of the audience suddenly walks into the theater from the outside, sees the picture on the stage, they can know which person on the stage to look at.</p>
<p>The actors are all very good, and they can all maintain the brisk pace of the farce. Only the one who played Han Yu, the tone of his voice was prolonged, and the heavy and slow walking and movements created an atmosphere that was not supposed to be in a farce. So it destroyed the mood of the play! This should be jointly responsible by the director and the actor.</p>
<p>The four words that appear at the end: "How Can This Not Be True?" are the author's deliberate surprise after writing the play, fearing that people would say he was absurd, giving the audience a chance to rethink. At the same time, he also told the audience, "This is really the case, don't treat it as a farce, it's not a play that ends with a laugh!"</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Director of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xin</p>
<p>"The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" records a historical event of national struggle. Although historical dramas may not perfectly align with history, an important mission is to never distort history. The fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was due to many reasons, but Yang Xiuqing's arrogance, Wei Changhui's insidiousness, and Hong Xiuquan's suspicion were factors that, starting from false pretenses, sowed the seeds of destruction. This demonstrates that throughout thousands of years of rise and fall, holding stubbornly to petty personal opinions led to the ruin of the country and the nation. In that sense, the script of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" truly fulfilled its task of being faithful to history.</p>
<p>However, to the general observer, the stage production of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" does not focus much on the Yang-Wei conflict, but rather highlights the love triangle between Hong Xuanjiao and Fu Shanxiang. But the author once stated in an interview that he wrote this script during the time when the war against Japan was suffering repeated defeats. The limitations of time and space may have placed many constraints on the author. But today, brought to the stage in Shanghai, even without completely revising the original work, through the director's editing, the audience may gain a slightly different impression than what the script provides.</p>
<p>The director believes that Hong Xuanjiao inherently has many weaknesses in his handling of the Hong and Fu characters. She loves Yang Xiuqing, but she cannot marry him again, so she hates the favored Fu Shanxiang and wishes she could get rid of her. She is the Heavenly King's sister, she has led troops, she has fought battles! For her, raising a sword is an easy task. The pain is that she has many internal contradictions, and Wei Changhui, the schemer, exploits her contradictions. As a result, she became unknowingly manipulated by Wei and became an accomplice to Wei Changhui in killing Yang Xiuqing. In order to "gain," she actually "lost." This is something she cannot bear when she is clear-headed. The reason why the repentance in the sixth act evokes sympathy lies in this.</p>
<p>As for Fu Shanxiang, in some aspects, she is also a woman of insight and courage. She participated in the Heavenly Kingdom's examination and became the female top scholar. Her ambition was to use this to contribute to the national revolution. Opportunity brought her close to the Eastern King, and her talent became Yang Xiuqing's pillar. She fully understands the hostility Hong Xuanjiao holds towards her. For the sake of the country's future, she truly wants to sacrifice herself to save the overall situation. If she were not a woman with masculine spirit and vision, she would never dare to go before Hong Xuanjiao to plead her case at the risk of her life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the director's intention in the stage presentation is very clear. Hong Xuanjiao has softness within her strength, and Fu Shanxiang shows strength within her gentleness. Although their conflicts are many, they do not give the impression of purely being a quarrel over jealousy. The director's painstaking efforts are evident here, and it is worth praising and introducing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the historical drama can never be completely performed. Watching the performance of "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" amidst the flames of war, while the audience laments the defeated heroes of history, they cannot help but sigh at the tragedy of this era.</p>
<h3 id="e168">City Drama School Students Organize Service Troupe <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The students of the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School have organized an "Amateur Drama Performance Service Troupe" to assist the school's drama troupe and amateur troupes in their performances with a purely voluntary spirit. The scope of service is tentatively set at: scenery, lighting, effects, makeup, and art design. In their declaration of establishment, there are these sincere words: "Historically, various schools and amateur troupes often find it difficult to achieve the expected results in the technical aspects of performance, such as stage design, lighting, effects, costumes, makeup, and publicity, due to various reasons. To remedy this shortcoming, we have created this service troupe organization, willing to help complete this arduous task with a purely voluntary spirit of mutual discussion and learning to seek progress.</p>
<p>We are young people who love drama art, and we are also young people who are learning drama art. We will not talk about profound theories, nor do we want to speak empty words; we are just working practically and realistically. We are willing to do our best to fulfill our due responsibilities."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Child Star Yu Fuying <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Dao</p>
<p>Yu Fuying, the child star who played Lili in "Orioles Fly in the Human World," will soon appear in "Returning Home in Glory." She is only eight years old this year, a native of Baoding, Hebei, and is in the third grade at Lehua Elementary School. She is intelligent, lively, innocent, and lovable. At such a young age, she already knows how to act in front of the camera. In "Orioles Fly in the Human World," when Liu Ying first came to Ren Yun's house, she stuffed a handful of peanuts into Liu Ying's pocket as she was leaving, which was very realistic! It doesn't make people feel like she's acting, or that the child is shy. Secondly, when she didn't want to leave after listening to the radio, and was called out by her father, her farewell to Liu Qi was filled with reluctance, which was also very real, not showing any pretense or artificiality. She plays Lin Ling in "Returning Home in Glory," and it is said that there will be more camera time than in "Orioles Fly in the Human World." This is a good opportunity to give her more practice so that she can follow in the footsteps of Chen Juanjuan.</p>
<p>In addition to Yu Fuying, there are also several other promising child stars in "Orioles Fly in the Human World," such as Shuixing, who had a nail in his car tire. In front of the camera, he did not lose his childlike innocence, which is truly commendable!</p>
<p>In the two films "A Loyal and Righteous Family" and "Orioles Fly in the Human World," the acting achievements of the big actors may not necessarily surpass those of these child stars! (The photo is of Yu Fuying)</p>
<h3 id="e170">Characters in "The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Wang</p>
<p>"The Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" depicts the story of the internal strife within the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Although the major and minor events within it are related to the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan and the King of Wings Shi Dakai, they never appear on stage. The characters who do appear are the Eastern King Yang Xiuqing, the Northern King Wei Changhui, the Western King's Consort Hong Xuanjiao, the female top scholar Fu Shanxiang, the state man Lai Hanying, and the traitor Zhang Tingyuan. The interaction and conflict between these characters form a tragic historical drama.</p>
<p>The Eastern King Yang Xiuqing held the military and political power of the Heavenly Kingdom. He was wise and decisive, and selfless. His talent came more from experience than from book learning. Because of his wisdom, he could allow Xiang Rong to besiege Tianjing (Nanjing) for several months, while internally mobilizing troops, consolidating the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and clearing the areas north and south of the Yangtze River, and finally resolving Xiang Rong's hundreds of thousands of soldiers? He was selfless, so he was not only strict with his subordinates, but also severely punished his brother the Northern King Wei Changhui, whom he had promoted, for his negligence in military affairs. Similarly, he also sternly questioned Fu Shanxiang's slander of the Heavenly King. Of course, he also knew that this was a malicious accusation with ulterior motives, so he couldn't bear to see Fu Shanxiang's crying. Because of his rich experience, he was organized in his work and use of troops. Because he knew that he "didn't have much book knowledge," he could reuse the female top scholar Fu Shanxiang to make up for his own shortcomings. Because of his trust in her, he fell in love with her. He came from humble beginnings, so he had a sense of loyalty and a simple and honest heart. He was also blinded by Wei Changhui's superficial gentleness and ultimately fell victim to him. But his death was mostly due to another aspect of his personality: stubborn self-confidence, arrogance, and pride. He could not weigh the importance of things, distinguish between truth and falsehood, or see through the inside story, so he suffered the tragic fate of being killed.</p>
<p>The Northern King Wei Changhui came from a merchant background and was skilled in calculation and infatuated with wealth and women. There was a traitor in the Northern King's mansion, but he was completely unaware of it. He only wanted to seize Hongluan, the Prime Minister's favorite. On the surface, he could endure grievances and be obedient, but he was actually hiding a knife in his smile and secretly plotting. He schemed, but never came forward himself. He knew the nature of women's jealousy, so he incited Hong Xuanjiao to kill Yang Xiuqing with her knife. At the same time, he also used his subordinates to secretly report to the Heavenly King that Yang Xiuqing was plotting a rebellion. This person only knew that "profit" was important, and fighting for power and profit was his true nature. Secret scheming and treachery were also the product of his background. He never knew to put the country and the nation first.</p>
<p>The Western King's Consort Hong Xuanjiao was a straightforward and frank woman. Years of not leading troops and being a widow had made her temperament eccentric and her heart narrow. Especially when she saw Yang Xiuqing, who had once pursued her passionately but now fell into Fu Shanxiang's arms, how could she suppress her jealousy and hatred, and the desire to strike a fatal blow? Moreover, Wei Changhui, like a powerful fan, constantly fanned the flames beside her, making her jealousy even more intense. She was confused about the interests of the country and the nation, and put her narrow personal grudges first, so she made an irreparable mistake. However, she belonged to the kind, and she had a kind nature. In the end, she finally repented and entered a convent.</p>
<p>Fu Shanxiang was a typical talented woman in the old society. In the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, she was like a crane standing among chickens. She had talent, knowledge, and insight, but she was also weak. She respected and loved the Eastern King, partly out of a sense of national and ethnic consciousness, and partly out of a hero-worshiping mentality. She was aware of the overall situation and recognized the urgent crisis in the situation. She could resolutely offer advice to Hong Xuanjiao and the Eastern King, but what was the use? These two were as hard as iron, and Hong Xuanjiao regarded her as a thorn in her side. How could her advice be accepted? The author has an excessive preference for Fu Shanxiang, even writing her as flawless, but we believe that she had some of the shortcomings of intellectuals.</p>
<p>The appearance of Lai Hanying is interesting. He is a typical representative of a muddled soldier. He would kill whoever the Heavenly King told him to kill. He had no faith or insight. Zhang Tingyuan was a typical traitor, with every cell poisoned by the Qing Dynasty's system.</p>
<p>The Audience Performance Company's performance of this play is quite meaningful, and the cast – Geng Zhen as the Eastern King, Shi Yu as the Northern King, Shu Xiuwen as Hong Xuanjiao, Fengzi as Fu Shanxiang, Zhang Yan as Lai Hanying, and Xu Ken as Zhang Tingyuan – is strong enough to be called strong, and under the direction of Ouyang Yuqian, it is believed that this performance will have a perfect achievement.</p>

<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Fantasy Journey to the South Seas</p>
<p>The genius Walt Disney, an artistic magician, from "Dumbo" to this "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas," like the shattered treasure bottle broken by Donald Duck in the film, scattered everywhere, colorful and infinitely brilliant, dazzling. His colorful brush also opened the door to dreams, inch by inch, step by step, truly a magnificent and picturesque world, breathtaking. Walt Disney's ingenuity and gimmickry have also reached their peak; the co-dancing of real people and cartoon characters, the singing of flower-filled beauties, and the presence of real people in cartoon backgrounds all prove the success of this experiment of real people participating in cartoons. There are countless beautiful scenes, white birds soaring in the crimson sky, a train in red flowers and green trees, dew drops on leaf petals breaking open a lake of ripples, and milky white trees dancing: extremely beautiful, the editing and rhythm of the whole film are excellent.</p>
<p>But we are very worried about Walt Disney. "Dumbo" and even "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas" have added alcohol and women, singing and dancing, completely losing all educational meaning. It is evident that he is now focusing on attracting adult audiences. It is no longer a children's cartoon, but purely an object of luxury in a prosperous society. Its focus has shifted to developing in terms of sound and color to entertain the audience, and therefore it is becoming more and more distant from permanent humanity. The cartoon characters created are becoming stereotyped. The three giants in "Fantasy Journey to the South Seas" are all arrogant and boastful villains. Only a few pages of paintings introducing Mexico, and a few greeting card-like pictures, are the only moments of quietness worth savoring in the disturbance. I like those faces of Mexican natives lighting candles and looking for a place to stay. Just as I like Carmen and Mona Lisa's dimples, and that currently popular song.</p>
<p>Flame of Desire</p>
<p>The director and screenwriter made Diana Barrymore successful in "Between Two Women," but the director and screenwriter did not give Donna Reed much to work with. Donna has a pure beauty. I still remember her beautiful figure behind the transparent umbrella in "The Human Comedy." I believe she has simple skills. The great director Capra recently took a liking to her and extended her contract to star in his first major work after the war, which shows that she is a talented individual. In fact, the subject matter of "Flame of Desire" could have become a beautiful story, but it lacks a coherent tempo and harmony. The second half is even more mediocre. Director Robert Leonard cannot avoid blame. Apart from a boxing match and a small opening section, everything else is simple and perfunctory. The sound, photography, and other elements were not properly managed. In the inn scene, the car drives in and out repeatedly, and the young lovers' cooperative dancing scene was not grasped, and no kind and sincere emotions were developed. These are all faults. A director whose representative works are "The Great Ziegfeld" and "The Gay Bride" is naturally not outstanding. Compared to Victor Fleming in "A Guy Named Joe" or William Dieterle in "Since You Went Away," he is indeed eclipsed. Charles Laughton is competent. Lee J. Cobb, who plays Neble, is a rising star worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Canary Row</p>
<p>Another wonderful comedy after "Between Two Women," again with the theme of a wealthy daughter pursuing a poor man. The clever thing is that it borrows the idea of a European princess seeking refuge. The scenes of women and men in pajamas are similar to "Happy Land," but the use of only a few title cards is better than "Happy Land." Norman Z. McLeod served as both director and screenwriter. The script and directing techniques are equally concise, relaxed, and lively. In particular, the dialogue in the script is humorous, eliciting natural laughter everywhere. The humor of "Between Two Women" mostly relies on action, which becomes contrived when overdone. "Canary Row" relies entirely on humorous language, and unlike Bob Hope's set of old tricks, the wonderful discussions in "The More the Merrier" and "My Eleven Brothers" are enough to make you laugh. Also, the princess's casual talk with her uncle Something Something's spouse is hilarious. The matchmaker president has not yet revealed his tricks. The highlight of the ending is the clever use of drama principles. It's just that the police shouldn't have been brought in, which is misleading. Olivia de Havilland and Charles Coburn, who plays the princess's uncle, are both very lively. Olivia should have wavy hair to complement her cheeks, which would make her more beautiful. Otherwise, she feels less attractive. Robert Siodmak is similar, "Between Two Women" is better. Dick Powell's straightforward style is also unique.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Hermann Hesse, Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>A Reuters report from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 14th stated: "The Swedish Academy has announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature will be awarded to the Swiss writer Hermann Hesse. Hesse was born in Germany and is currently 69 years old. He was formerly a theologian."</p>
<p>Hesse was born in 1877 and is 69 years old this year. He is a quiet, peaceful figure full of the Swiss spirit. He is good at writing novels, especially short stories. His depiction of emotional changes is especially pure and clear. He is particularly skilled at conveying all the trivial and quiet things in the environment, vividly and accurately. He likes to recall childhood memories and daily details. Most of his works are very well written.</p>
<p>His representative works from his early years are the novels "Peter Camenzind" (1904) and "Gertrud" (1910). Ludwig Lewisohn, in his book "The Spirit of Modern German Literature," writes about these two books: "Hesse is a master of interpreting novels. His novels are few and short, but full of lyrical atmosphere. His best works, "Peter Camenzind" and "Gertrud," are written in the first person and are full of simple and lovely depictions of the scenery of southwestern Germany. The student Camenzind and the musician Kuhn in "Gertrud" are both passionate souls, full of calls for life, "the flowers of youth, and this lovely world." Both of them fail and cannot satisfy their calls. Camenzind cannot express his true self to his companions, and Kuhn is a cripple. Therefore, the endings of both books carry a tone of defeat and retreat. But these two people are not disappointed with life. In their dissatisfaction, there rises praise for the beauty and change, the fun and passion of nature. In loneliness and failure, they are still affirming life."</p>
<p>"Peter Camenzind" is about a Swedish farm boy who, after wandering and being disappointed, returns home and finds comfort. Other famous novels include "Beneath the Wheel" (Unterm Rad, 1905), which describes a troubled student who initially overcomes the environment but eventually commits suicide and becomes a victim of the environment. The novella "Demian" (1919) won the Fontane Prize. It describes the development of young people before the war and the influence of the times. His talent for narration reached full maturity here, and this became Hesse's most successful and immortal masterpiece. "Journey to India" (Aus Indien, 1913) is also written with lingering emotion. His "Knulp" is the most exquisitely written short piece describing trivial matters and leisure.</p>
<p>His short stories can be said to be pearls, including the following: "This Side" (Diesseits, 1907), "Neighbor" (Nachbar, 1908), "Detours" (Umwege, 1910), "Small Garden" (Kleine Garten, 1919), "Fairy Tale" (Marchen, 1919), and "Klingsor's Last Summer" (Klingsors Letzler Sommer, 1920).</p>
<p>There is also a book "Zarathustra's Return" (Zaratu tras Wiederkehr, 1920), which is also a good work dedicated to young people.</p>
<p>This article also draws on Zhang Chuanpu's "Outline of German Literary History," Yu Xiangsen's "History of German Literature," and "Trends in Modern German Literature." Thank you for your contributions.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Mutual Help in a Dry Rut—A Sentimental Reflection on the "Literary Talk Society"— <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xinghuo</p>
<p>In the "Chunqiu" column, I have read more than once suggestions and news about the "Literary Talk Society." Living in a remote small town, I have no chance to participate in this grand event in person, to witness the demeanor of senior writers, and to receive their teachings; but I truly yearn for this meaningful gathering. Every time I see the small invitation card published in the "Chunqiu" corner, I wish I could immediately sprout wings and fly to Shanghai to sit in a lowly seat. However, in this day when shrinking the earth is impossible, this hope remains just a hope, and I don't know when it will be fulfilled. However, I have a small idea that I have long wanted to offer through writing as a most sincere contribution to the Literary Talk Society:</p>
<p>In this historically unprecedented era of disasters and hardships, as a literary person, the difficulties encountered are often greater than those of ordinary people. This is because they are sensitive, stubborn, and brave in fighting against reality, unwilling to succumb to the environment; they have sharp eyes, not only clearly observing the past and seeing through the present, but also able to look forward to the future; they have a pen that serves justice and truth, never willing to write a word that deceives their conscience, or even a character that violates reason...!</p>
<p>Because of this, it is as if they are destined to constantly endure spiritual and physical torments that ordinary people cannot endure, even threatening their lives.</p>
<p>The literary people who are fortunate enough to escape the disaster of the axe, if they are not accustomed to licking blood off the tip of the knife, the mental torture alone is unbearable.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has always been said, "Suffering hardship makes one skilled." In fact, this saying was fabricated by those who live in luxury and without worry to deceive people. They themselves are accustomed to eating delicacies, but want others to write articles on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>In fact, when writers have to waste a large amount of time running around for firewood, rice, oil, and salt, waste it on fetching water, washing clothes, mending socks, chopping firewood, waste it on illness, insomnia, anxiety, and fear, it is inevitable that decent works cannot be produced today.</p>
<p>The low value of articles has not started today, but the disparity between the price of articles and bread can be said to be greater than ever before. Currently, the fees for general newspaper articles are only three to five thousand yuan per thousand words, which is really not enough for a meager meal. Even the higher fees are only ten thousand yuan per thousand words, which is far from the pre-war standard of two to five yuan per thousand words. Before the war, writers who relied on article income to maintain their lives could avoid hunger and cold if they could write an average of 20,000 words per month for a family of three. What about now?——Moreover, the hardship of life directly affects the emotions and work efficiency of writers. People who could originally write 20,000 words per month, due to the troubles of firewood, rice, oil, and salt, have no peace of mind for a moment, and probably have to discount their output.</p>
<p>In this era, are those who still hold onto their pens and refuse to let go, wearing the empty title of "writer" and unwilling to change careers, not complete fools? The clothes they wear and the food they eat are so crude that the general public in society does not take them seriously, and their social status declines along with their living standards.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw four consecutive comic strips in a certain evening newspaper, depicting a literary person buried in writing on a wooden box, while his wife and children cry beside him due to hunger and cold. Then the literary person becomes ill and dies, leaving behind a pile of tattered books, which his wife finally takes to a used bookstore to exchange for a few coins to buy pancakes to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>This is the fate of literary people, this is the fate of Chinese literary people in the 1950s!</p>
<p>Is this fate really ordained by destiny? Can this fate really not be changed by human effort?</p>
<p>Many people laugh at us as fools, as Ah Q, but we ourselves feel at ease. Over the millennia, many heroes and powerful figures who were once prominent have returned to dust, but only the works of art created by literary people are eternally new. They also suffered countless hardships at the time, but no hardship could make them bow their heads. Therefore, their spirit gained eternal life along with those eternal works, like Homer, Shakespeare, Byron, Goethe, Turgenev, Maupassant, like Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Li Bai... They transcend national boundaries and ancient and modern times, forever giving people spiritual nourishment and warmth; in the history of mankind, if there had not been so many literary giants, where would the brilliant fruits of culture in this world have come from?</p>
<p>In a dry rut, mutual support, warmth, and empathy among kind and upward-striving writers, and even passionate exchanges, are indeed very necessary: only collective strength can encourage each constituent element to bravely strive upward and overcome all external temptations; only collective strength can solve individual difficulties and promote the publishing industry to change the past practice of "braising writer meat," so that authors can obtain the rights they deserve.</p>
<p>This kind of informal gathering of writers can be widely imitated in various places, because writers in various places need to support and warm each other, and need to swim in the emotional current of the majority to temper and encourage themselves.</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Gai Zun once had a poem like this: "Mutual moisture creates a sea"; this is not impossible, because the rivers and seas are originally accumulated from drops of water. If each of us regards ourselves as a drop of water, and we accumulate enough, can't we also form rivers and seas? (March 5, 11, 15, in Gucheng)</p>

<h3 id="e176">Smoking <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yang</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, when I was only a child of ten or so, I had already tucked away a small dry tobacco pipe and a silk embroidered tobacco pouch, pretending to be a little old man, an old smoker. In fact, at that time, I had no interest in smoking itself, but rather in the attitude when smoking; this attitude entertained me for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Since I was young, I stayed by my grandmother's side: she took care of the trivial matters of serving me rice and vegetables for three meals a day, and at night she slept close to me in bed, and always pestered her to tell me stories. Whenever a story reached a tense part, she would temporarily pause and pack a bowl of dry tobacco. Blue smoke drifted from beside the pillow, stimulating me to close my eyes, and gradually enveloped my grandmother and me, and the story seemed to become even more bizarre and ethereal. I loved my grandmother, and over time I also fell in love with my grandmother's silver dry tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>Old Wang, our family's long-term worker, was a warrior who ventured outside the Great Wall in his youth and went deep into the mountains and dense forests to collect ginseng. Although he is old now, he still holds a rough, long iron pipe weighing two pounds, with a mouthpiece as big as a wine glass. He often pointed to this thing, boasting about the heroic deeds of using it to fight in the past. Every time the evening glow dyed the mountains, after finishing the work in the fields, I had to wait on his back for a few minutes, watching him squat under the tree to smoke a big bowl; the smoke emitted from his hair-covered nostrils often made me fantasize about swordsmen and bodyguards, so I became even more eager to smoke.</p>
<p>Later, I begged and pleaded with Cook Zhao Ma, who finally sewed me a small silk embroidered tobacco pouch and bought a small copper pipe at the market. I secretly took some of my grandmother's or Old Wang's tobacco and actually began to exhale clouds and mist.</p>
<p>Since my mother sent me to school in the city, books and new games have replaced smoking. In a flash, it has been more than ten years. I have been away from tobacco for a long time. Resuming smoking is only a recent thing; and now I smoke cigarettes. The era of pipes and pouches is long gone.</p>
<p>When I am upset, distressed, frustrated, or angry, I smoke; one cigarette after another, while pacing alone in the small room.</p>
<p>When I have fulfilled a wish, done a good job, or returned from a short journey, and lie on the bed to release the tension and fatigue of my body and mind, I smoke; and prepare for the next start.</p>
<p>When I sit near the lamp to conceive an article, the previous section is completed, and the next paragraph is brewing, I smoke; my spirit will be relaxed by this, and my thoughts will be abundant. When there is a beautiful scenery, or when I encounter something pleasant, I smoke; the excited and blooming heart slowly closes again.</p>
<p>When a gentle breeze caresses the window, and moonlight sprinkles on the pillow; or when storms and snow control the universe, and my soul is entangled in the past, I smoke; from a series of swirling clouds of smoke, I see again my childhood, old dreams, and the affectionate eyes of my first love.</p>
<p>I endure smoking, and walk the road of battle with increasing determination.</p>
<p>I spit out smoke arrows, with a throbbing heart, and finished reading the family letter reporting the tragic news of my fourth brother.</p>
<p>I vigorously threw away the half-smoked cigarette butt, and blessed my parents living in famine and war.</p>
<p>I lit a cigarette and waved goodbye to my lover on the grassland.</p>
<p>Now, I have come to this sinful Eastern metropolis, and I will use smoke to record the marks carved into my life.</p>
<p>Tobacco has deeply wedged itself into my life, and is no longer an entertainment item of life.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As soon as this woman entered the room, her bright eyes, with just a slight flash, showed that she had taken in the entire situation in the room; what was especially surprising was that even Tsurumi, who was sitting in the dark corner, did not escape her gaze; perhaps because the lighting in that location was dimmer, her gaze lingered on Tsurumi for just a few hundredths of a second longer. This was easily noticeable to those who were paying attention.</p>
<p>Tsurumi had no need to be on guard. Even if this woman brought over the few guys who were lurking outside with her, Tsurumi would not find it very difficult to deal with them, because in terms of Tsurumi's work objectives, his position was equivalent to being on the dangerous peak of a perilous mountain, always on guard. In addition, he was also paying attention to this woman from a third-party perspective, detached from the matter.</p>
<p>That being said, the development of events suddenly gave Tsurumi a start: because the woman paused slightly at the entrance, for only five or ten seconds. Short enough to maintain her graceful and dignified demeanor and restore her original poise, before taking graceful and light steps, heading straight for Tsurumi; and from the first step, she had been looking at Tsurumi, slightly furrowing her brows, followed immediately by a charming smile.</p>
<p>Wasn't this woman's action a bit too abrupt? No. This action was not only not abrupt, but also had a necessary reason. In this reason, there were at least two or three important intentions: the first intention was to give Tsurumi a warning: "Pay attention, I'm here. Please act natural, so as not to make outsiders feel that my actions are abrupt." Or, "Pay attention, you need to be clear, I come with civility before force. You can't act rashly, and make people see that you are a novice. Even if you are not prepared to accept my attack, you must appear calm." Another important relationship was speaking from the standpoint of "our own people." Although the two had never met, were strangers to each other, one could not make it look like they didn't know each other in front of the other characters of He Shan and other secret numbers, causing them to be surprised and therefore pay attention.</p>
<p>The woman's warning of a frown followed by a smile, although it caused Tsurumi some surprise, was not because it contained secrecy, but rather because of the sensitivity of his senses. Although he would not be moved by this woman's beauty, he did have an aesthetic sense, otherwise why would he give her a rating of 95 points? This aesthetic appreciation, of course, could not help but make him pay more attention, especially since she contained secrecy and was also paying attention to her actions. With this longer attention, and the object of attention suddenly attacking him directly, he would naturally feel that this was an accident. Although the intentions were unknown, his instincts could not help but produce a surprising sensitivity.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Tsurumi. Such rashness is truly impolite!" The woman said extremely generously, extending her hand as she spoke, completely imitating Western actions. She spoke with a pure Tokyo accent, and the beauty of her voice was like pearls falling on a jade plate, so round and jade-like. When she spoke, she had a smile on her face, and the smile was tinged with a layer of red glow, like a rose facing the rising sun, slightly opening the tips of its petals.</p>
<p>Tsurumi, on his side, had already stood up calmly, shaking the woman's hand in a gentlemanly manner, nodding slightly, and smiling, "Not at all, not at all, I was hoping for your esteemed presence!" Saying this, knowing that the woman intended to sit down, he also followed Western etiquette, moving the chair away for her and helping her to sit down. At the same time, he nodded slightly to the waiter who was slowly moving over, and gently asked this beautiful and unexpected visitor, "Would the young lady like to have some...?"</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Late at night, the sound of the Jianghai Customs bell is particularly loud. The long, slow, and lonely tone fully illustrates the story of people suffering in time. Alas, your cruelty of every minute and second is both impossible to recover and drags on so slowly and tediously! The painful complaint, this bell! Withered vines, old trees, crows, setting sun, west wind, and skinny horse. The evening bell should also occupy a place in this scene.</p>
<p>Children are lovely because they represent hope, and their future time is very long. Adults like children, on the one hand, because of the sentiment of mourning the past, and on the other hand, because of envy.</p>
<p>The Bible says: Children can enter the kingdom of heaven. Here, it is explaining the meaning of "the pure in heart are blessed." Children are innocent and innocent, how can they hollow out their minds with deception and fraud? How can those who calculate all day long have happiness?</p>
<p>After the implementation of the import permit system, many non-essential foreign goods will not be able to enter, especially the ladies and misses who are used to using American cosmetics, such as perfumes and powders, will feel panicked.</p>
<p>Cosmetics and beauty are a huge multi-million dollar business in the United States. According to statistics, by the end of 1946, American women will spend 700 million yuan in this area. The number is amazing enough! In fact, not only women need cosmetics, but men also need them, but only to varying degrees. (In the same) year, American men will spend 30 million yuan on cosmetics.)</p>
<p>Loving beauty is human nature. Despite the restrictions on imports, American-made cosmetics will not disappear. If you don't believe it, watch what happens later.</p>

<p>— Zhengfan</p>
<p>The Battle for the Hardoon Estate</p>
<p>E.D. Sassoon - Who in Shanghai doesn't know the name of this lucky Jew? Shanghai residents have long understood the history of his life as a "successful speculator," from a "road inspector" who managed garbage to a real estate tycoon who was the richest man in Shanghai. How much was his wealth? Hardoon's estate was estimated at four million pounds when he died. This huge estate caused endless harm, causing fifteen years of entanglement, East grabbing, West fighting, a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>And recently, suddenly twelve Iraqis have joined the battle group, preparing to start another big lawsuit and entangle themselves:</p>
<p>It's a Long Story</p>
<p>This estate dispute is really a long story. Since June 1931, when Mr. Hardoon abandoned the wealth he had painstakingly managed and his wife, Madame Luo Jialing, and returned to the West, the issue of offspring caused a commotion. Then an Iraqi, a close relative of Hardoon, contested Hardoon's estate with Luo Jialing, submitting a statement to the British court requesting that Hardoon's estate be analyzed according to Iraqi law. Because according to Iraqi law, close relatives can get three-quarters of the estate.</p>
<p>Hardoon was a Jew, born in Baikt, Iraq, with Iraqi nationality. But some people also said that Hardoon had joined the Gong nationality. What "nationality" was he exactly? Hardoon had not made a "solemn declaration" during his lifetime, and could not be verified after his death. But the British government's greed for this huge estate was a fact, and the policy of the former Shanghai Municipal Council was based on the votes of taxpayers, and the number of votes was based on the amount of real estate. Hardoon's property was large, and he had more voting rights. Grasping Hardoon's property was tantamount to strengthening control over the Municipal Council. Therefore, the British government said: Hardoon was a British-protected person and should be subject to British law. The Iraqi lost the lawsuit.</p>
<p>As a result, Luo Jialing firmly grasped Hardoon's estate for a full ten years. Three years before her death, she went blind, but she still held on to the estate. She was Chinese, and China was fighting a difficult war of resistance, but no one had ever heard of her donating half a cent. To say that Hardoon had once joined the British nationality, when Britain and Germany went to war, there was no evidence that she had donated a penny to the British government. She was willing to spend money on the bald heads of several monks, helping them to create strange secrets.</p>
<p>Money is the Root of Evil</p>
<p>Luo Jialing and Hardoon were married for forty years, but they had no "sons or daughters," but they loved to adopt adopted sons and daughters, creating countless seeds of dispute after their deaths. During the early years of the Republic of China, when what was then known as "Kaitse University" was in operation, male and female students in the school who were favored by the madam were adopted under her name. There were no fewer than a hundred people. However, the madam was capricious, and if any of the adopted sons and daughters were slightly dissatisfied, they would be expelled immediately. In the end, there were only nine adopted sons and nine adopted daughters left.</p>
<p>Madame Jialing wanted to enjoy happiness and spend her old age in peace, but she did not expect that ten close relatives of Hardoon had hired the Japanese lawyer Okamoto, demanding to divide 43.7 million yuan in legal tender, and also published a "warning notice" in the newspaper, refusing to acknowledge others' disposal of the property. Then the chief accountant of Hardoon's Foreign Firm, Ji Juemi, was kidnapped on Seymour Road. Unpleasant things happened again and again, and finally his lung disease recurred, and he "returned to paradise"!</p>
<p>The adopted sons, adopted brothers, adopted daughters, adopted grandchildren... in the Aili Garden were first busy taking care of the funeral. A huge obituary was published in the newspaper, and behind it was a long row of names, which were those who volunteered to come forward and confessed to the desire for the estate!</p>
<p>As a result, the show continued; at first, the British consulate notified the police and sent personnel to protect Hardoon's property. During Luo Jialing's funeral, important documents of Hardoon's Foreign Firm were secretly moved by the bodyguard of "adopted brother" Ji Juemi, but were detected and seized by the police of the Municipal Council, and Ji Juemi later claimed that it was a misunderstanding. Even more "unfathomable" was that a "double case" was found in the will!</p>
<p>You Snatch, I Plunder</p>
<p>Hardoon had made a will before his death, in which he specified that 70% of all property should belong to his adopted son George Hardoon (stateless). However, when Luo Jialing passed away, a second will was discovered, with vastly different contents. Luo Jialing's adopted son George Hardoon recognized the first will, while another adopted son, Luo Youlan, and other Chinese "unfilial orphans and grieving children" insisted that the second will was valid, vying and stirring up a lot of trouble. Representatives of Hardoon's relatives in the newspaper also came to join in the fun, demanding that Hardoon's estate be analyzed according to Iraqi law.</p>
<p>The characters in Aili Garden were originally divided into three major systems: one system was led by Ji Juemi, and another system was the characters listed in the obituary, "deeply sinful, not doomed to perish." Among them, there were two factions: one faction was those who often served Madame Luo Jialing, and the other faction was those who had once fallen out of favor with the madam, such as George Hardoon and others who had been expelled. The "triangular" material was already very lively, and adding twelve Iraqis made it a "quadrangle," which was even more "amazing."</p>
<p>After the victory, the unfinished case of fifteen years of dispute was rekindled. Twelve Iraqi descendants planned to hire lawyers again to file a lawsuit. What would be the result? "Let's wait for the next chapter."</p>
<p>In short, stirring up and plundering is all for "money." Hardoon was reluctant to spend even pocket money during his lifetime and earned "too much" property. After his death, it caused a chaotic mess. The misers of the world can also be enlightened!</p>

<p>— Maye</p>
<p>On the 30th of last month, a telegram in various newspapers said that the Northeast was planning to use "soybeans to manufacture wool." The writer once raised a question in the column, believing that soybeans are used to manufacture "artificial wool," that is, "artificial short fibers," and the word "artificial" cannot be omitted, just like "rayon" is different from natural silk.</p>
<p>After the 9th, after the translated United Press 7th New York telegram, I learned that scientists have "discovered a method of artificial penicillin that can manufacture new types of penicillin..." The writer does not have a method to find the original telegram for reference, but based on common sense, this time the "artificial" seems to also have room for consideration.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that penicillin is "extracted" from the culture solution of Penicillium, and so far, the "Penicillium" of "penicillin" sold in pharmacies is just like maggots picked out of a dung tank and sealed in a bottle for sale. Maggots are also "manufactured" by God, not "artificial."</p>
<p>Probably since last year, many scientists have been working in chemical laboratories, trying to directly "manufacture" penicillin using synthetic chemical methods. This summer, I remember seeing in some English science magazine that a scientist had discovered a clue to manufacturing Penicillium using a synthetic method. If successful, "penicillin" would not need to be cultured in a culture solution and extracted from the culture solution, and the price would definitely be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>If the original telegram on the 7th said that the "synthetic" manufacturing method was successful, then our translation of the telegram should not omit the word "synthetic." If not, and the original intention was just to say that there is a new method to culture or extract it, then the word "artificial" seems inappropriate. Because if artificially synthesized penicillin has really been successfully researched, it will definitely be listed as one of the major inventions of the year.</p>
<p>Cowhide with beef is natural cowhide. The leather made through the leather-making process for leather shoes is just "leather processing." Only "artificial leather," which is made by mixing and compounding paper pulp, plastics, and hard fillers under high pressure like Germany used to do, is the real "artificial."</p>
<p>Another example: In the past, sex hormone preparations were extracted from the urine of pregnant women, animal ovaries, and animal testicles, but new "synthetic" or "artificial" hormones are "synthesized" by chemists in test tubes. Both are sold on the market.</p>
<p>"Synthetic chemistry" is the darling of modern chemistry. At first, chemists magically synthesized "organic" urea from "inorganic" drugs in test tubes. This is a major event in modern chemical history.</p>
<p>I hope that my above guess is wrong. If it is really "a thousand thoughts of a fool," then I just want to reiterate the suggestion at the end of the previous short article: journalists should divide their work. This is not a joke but something I have personally seen: a translator who can fluently translate Churchill's speech translated "submarine base" as "undersea stronghold"!</p>

<h3 id="e183">Skimming is Corruption <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Rong</p>
<p>From the American perspective, "skimming" is almost a universal phenomenon among the Chinese people. The following is a satirical description:</p>
<p>"Chinese people like to skim. When buying things for friends, they always take at least ten percent as a commission."</p>
<p>It's so common for tram conductors to "skim" that it's no longer surprising!</p>
<p>I remember the sensational case of the gold brick theft by a custodian, who indulged in extravagant pleasures. To him, it was just a momentary lapse, a thought of using the money temporarily. Who would willingly walk into the legal net? In reality, it wouldn't be wrong to say he was "skimming."</p>
<p>Recently, Wu Suiren, a senior staff member of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), illegally used 2.7 billion yuan of CRRRA funds to make high-interest loans. I'm not acting as a pro bono lawyer for the guy. In principle, keeping that 2.7 billion yuan locked in an iron box is pointless. Why not use it for circulation and loan it out at a 20% interest rate, adding 54 million yuan to the monthly income? What's not to like? In the current stage where advanced electronic calculators can't beat the old Chinese abacus, I can't help but admire the Chinese abacus!</p>
<p>I've described the above serious corruption case as a lighthearted "skimming." "Corruption" can be considered "skimming," so why can't "skimming" be considered "corruption?" It's just that "skimming" is small, and "corruption" is big. "Skimming" and "corruption" are like fifty steps versus a hundred steps – the errors committed are the same.</p>
<p>I hope that this special Chinese characteristic of enjoying "skimming" won't be imitated by those above and below, becoming a continuous cycle. Officials skimming from soldiers, officials skimming from the people – this bad habit should be completely eradicated. Otherwise, I really can't bear to say it!</p>

<h3 id="e185">An Open Letter <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Shuijin</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: Many readers have responded to Mr. Ji Shui's proposal for occupational insurance. This publication has received many letters expressing opinions on this matter, and many letters are to be forwarded to Mr. Ji Shui, which this publication has done. We have now received a letter from Mr. Ji Shui, stating that this movement has already begun. The following is his open letter.)</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>Dear ones, I have a very fun, not-too-big, not-too-small thing to tell you. Do you want to hear it?</p>
<p>First, I must ask you two questions. First, do you have a lot of property at home? Second, do you have any close relatives who are serving as chiefs or directors? If you have neither a great deal of property nor any relatives who are chiefs or directors, I think you will agree with what I am about to tell you.</p>
<p>What I want to tell you is the "promotion of occupational insurance" that I have shouted twice. We are people who do what we say. The work of "occupational insurance" has already begun to be implemented. A dozen of us, some familiar and some new friends, are saving two yuan each month, calculated based on the cost of living index, and preparing to deposit it in a reputable bank to earn interest. If any of us dozen friends become unemployed, we will immediately introduce them to a job that can help them and their families. But our foundation is too fragile now, and we will only temporarily delay providing relief to friends who have not yet fulfilled their obligations. If our new friends increase day by day, and our savings also increase day by day, in addition to the original introduction and relief work, we will also run a cooperative society – a mixed cooperative society integrating production, credit, consumption, and construction. We will use our own funds to build houses for our friends to live in, use our own funds to run small factories and farms to provide work for friends who truly cannot find a job, use our own funds to provide credit for our friends to manage their finances, and use our own funds to operate consumption cooperatives to reduce the exploitation of merchants.</p>
<p>Friends, do you believe my words?</p>
<p>Friends, have you heard the story of the battleship "America's Young Children"? If you believe that story, then you will surely believe my words.</p>
<h3 id="e186">How to Cooperate <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>Regarding "occupational insurance," it is almost universally implemented in advanced countries. In the Soviet Union, it is called "social insurance." This undertaking is sponsored by the country. Last year, the Soviet government allocated 110 billion rubles in its budget to promote this undertaking. In the fourth five-year plan, 616 billion rubles were estimated to be spent on "social insurance." This undertaking is also highly valued in socialist countries. But capitalist countries, such as the United States and Britain, are also vigorously promoting it.</p>
<p>"Occupational insurance," as the name suggests, is a kind of guarantee for your and my occupation. But this is not a guarantee for your and my current occupation, but rather a guarantee that you and I will not be afraid of unemployment in the future. In other words, when you or I become unemployed in the future, we can obtain a job. However, this requires everyone to have a common cooperative foundation in advance.</p>
<p>We must first widely seek comrades and start by having those who are employed participate in the organization, and then promote it to those who are unemployed, so that they can also participate in the cooperation.</p>
<p>For example, we establish an ×× occupational insurance company and solicit members. After each member joins this cooperative company, he is a shareholder or a beneficiary of the company, and they can obtain the rights and guarantees they deserve.</p>
<p>For example, now you want to join this organization as a member. You should first fill out the various forms given to you honestly. It is to investigate your skills, occupational interests, family situation, and monthly income and expenditure, because in the future, when you are unemployed and need relief, the company will provide relief or introduce you to a suitable job according to the forms you filled out. Therefore, when you fill out the form, you should not exaggerate or conceal anything. Since the company has such a major responsibility for your future needs and job introductions, then you must pay the company a few percent of each person's monthly income as specified by the company each month. The company will first gather these funds as a fund. This is the member's obligation.</p>
<p>After the member has fulfilled his due obligations, he can enjoy the following rights in the future:</p>
<p>Once you are unemployed, the company will immediately solve the problem of finding a job for you or ensure your livelihood.</p>
<p>The company deposits all the membership fees paid by the members in the bank. If this company has 20,000 members, each person has to pay an average of 20,000 yuan per month, so the total income is 400 million yuan, and after one year, it will be 4.8 billion yuan, not including interest.</p>
<p>The company uses this money to engage in many socially beneficial production activities, such as establishing stores that supply affordable goods (not officially priced goods, but truly affordable goods with no pure profit), running schools, building residential areas, and establishing farms, etc.</p>
<p>The above is just an outline. If we want to do it, we still have to plan it in detail. As long as everyone has a positive mindset, this proposal is not just talk!</p>
