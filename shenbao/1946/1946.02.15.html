<h3>二十萬市民熱情奔放　歡迎會盛況空前　主席偕夫人親臨剴別致訓</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市五百萬市民爲歡迎　蔣主席勝利後首次蒞滬，昨特在跑馬聽舉行空前隆盛之歡迎大會，適逢天氣晴朗，陽光普照，大地四春，益增熱烈情緒。昨日之盛會，爲滬市空前所未見，市民爲崇敬及感戴主席之豐功偉績，莫不翹盼一睹闊別八載，時繫縈念之一代偉人丰采，故全市各區萬人空巷，尤以南京中路一帶，人山人海，途爲之塞，歡呼聲爆竹聲，打成一片，情况之熱烈，得未曾有。大會會塲，前晚即已大致布置就緒，簡潔莊嚴而美觀，參加大會者計共二百餘團體，以其性質分，計有職業工會，產業工會，同業公會，特種社團，自由職業團體，黨政機關等六種，連同學生及自由參加之民衆的二十餘萬人，下午一時左右，各參加團體，均開始整隊出發，魚貫進入會塲，各佔規定地位，秩序井然，以參加人數如是之多，情况如是盛大之偉大塲面，而秩序如此良好，實開本市之先例。　主席與夫人，於下午三時正，由侍從及錢市長陪同蒞會，千萬市民，得瞻仰　主席及夫人丰采，莫不欣喜若狂，而對於　主席之剴切訓詞，尤深切感動，是以每當　主席訓話一段告畢，即報以熱烈之鼓掌與歡呼。大會於三時正開始，至三時二十五分許即告結束，當　主席及夫人離開會塲，步下主席台時，似對全塲民衆戀戀不捨，欲行復止，繼以揮手點首，塲內自由參加之民衆及大批盟友　擁而前，雖軍警竭力維持秩序，終不能遏止廣大羣衆因愛戴領袖所發出之在熱，而　主席及夫人遂在此在熱動人之塲面下，步出會塲，爲車遄返官邸，茲將詳情分誌於後：</p>

<p>主席頻揚手示意</p>
<p>昔年用作賽馬之跑馬廳，昨午因上海各界歡迎病　主席蒞臨，被廿萬民衆之歡呼聲所震蕩，中午十二時後，各參加歡迎大會之機關與團體，即先後列隊入塲，下午二時，此平時寗靜之大廣塲，已人山人海，各團體與機關所備之國黨旗及機關名稱橫幟，在靑天白日下，隨風飄揚，塲外千萬民衆，爭欲一瞻　主席夫婦丰采，途爲之塞。昨日中美憲警全部出動，堪內攝影記者大忙，二時半，魏德邁將軍，柯克將軍，陳納德將軍，冰克將軍等先後到場，與在台各首長恭候主席於台上。三時正舉世景仰之　主席夫婦，由錢市長大鈞陪同準時蒞臨，頓時掌聲雷動，爲抗戰以來空前未有之塲面，勞苦功高之　蔣主席，當即頻頻揚手，與台下歡呼欲狂之民衆爲禮，隨即與夫人緩步登台，並頻頻向民衆點首，夫人衣棕色海虎絨大衣，紅色圍巾，始終保持和藹之笑容，　主席隨即對全塲民衆發表歷時二二盼鐘這訓詞。（原文見另條）　主席致訓時，全塲聽衆，數度熱烈鼓掌，　主席訓話完畢，掌聲歷時數分鐘不止，最後，　主席並向立於其右旁之魏德邁將軍，夫人左旁之柯克將軍，陳納德將軍致謝，並向全市市民表示謝意，於是全體民衆共同歡呼「蔣主席萬歲」，「中華民國萬歲」「萬萬歲」，典禮在三時二十五分完成。　主席夫婦當即由侍從陪同離跑馬廳，而各歡迎民衆，則歷時甚久，方告散去。昨日跑馬廳中之盛會，爲抗戰勝利以來所僅見，爲上海人民帶來莫大之興奮，甚多從未得見　蔣主席之中外人士，均謂「我們到底見到蔣主席和夫人了」。</p>

<h3>主席訓詞全文　恢復固有道德實踐新生活　維護主權保持自由和獨立</h3>
<p>蔣主席偕夫人昨出席全市民衆歡迎大會，於羣衆歡聲沸騰中，發表演詞如下：親愛的同胞們：</p>
<p>上海是中正的故鄕，中正離開故　已經有九年之久，在這九年餘的歲月之中，有整整的八年，上海被敵人所佔領，上海的男女老幼，遭遇敵人的殘殺和蹂躪，受過暗無天日的生活，中正無時無刻不在想念之中。今天勝利之從，中正回到上海，和各位同胞在跑馬廳見面，心中實在有無限感慨。今天到會的同胞，年長的就是中正的父兄，年幼的就是中正的子弟，現在我和我的父兄子弟，姑嫂姊妹相見的時候，有如家庭團聚的一樣心情，所以要貢獻幾句內心所發的拙詞，希　各位同胞，時刻銘心，共同一致的</p>
<p>大家都知道，八年以前，我們要的今天一樣，在跑馬廳開會，是一件不可能的事，爲什慶大家現在能够在這裏自由的開會，爲什麼我今天能够在這個地方和各位相聚呢？這就是由於我們全國同胞八年來艱苦抗戰的精神，引起了盟邦美·英·蘇·法以及其他各友邦對我們軍民的尊敬，獲得了盟邦的同情，因此取消了不平等條約，收回了各地所有的租界，我們中華民國的地位，亦獲得了獨立自由。但是各位要知道，現在租界雖已敢向，不平等條約雖已廢除，然面我們今後要怎樣纔能維護國家的主權，要怎樣纔能保持我們所獲得的自由和獨立，這個保障和維護的任務，較之過去八年間爭取自由獨立的工作，更要困難，更要辛苦，我們今後要保障國家的獨立，民　的自由，必須要我們　　努力實行，中正個人一定以身作則，來作谷位同胞的倡導。</p>
<p>下定次心，要比抗戰期間更要吃苦，更要耐勞，再經過八年，方能確實保障這個獨立自由的基礎。中國國民黨自　國父領導國民革命運動以來，與我全國同胞共同奮鬥五十餘年，到今犬已經達成了他國家獨立自由的目的，而中正個人，亦總算沒有辜負我們全體同胞的期望，但是今後這個保障國家獨立自由的責任，就在於我們各位同胞肩上了，所以我今天對我同胞要特別提醒的，就是今後建立國家保障獨立的責任，要由你們大家共同來担負了。</p>
<p>但是我們如何纔能保障我們國家自由獨立的主權，而再不致於喪失呢？如何纔不愧爲一個自由獨立的國民呢？關於這一點，我今天要特別指示出來，亦就是我在開始所說，要你們大家時刻銘心，努力實行的就是以下幾句話：我以爲，今後建國與保障獨立自由最重要的，就是要恢復中國固有的道德，發揮我們建國新的精神，實踐我們新的生活，來轉移麻木遲鈍的　氣，我們每一個同胞，一定要明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律。現在我們盟邦美·英·蘇·法等國之所以能成其强大，完全是由於他們一般國民道德高尙，對於國家能自動的負責任，守紀律，能公而忘私，能國而忘家，我們如要與各盟邦　獨立自由，立在平等地位上，我們就要像他們一樣的愛國，一樣的團結，一樣的道德，一樣的精神，更要比他們能吃苦，能耐勞，所以我們不只是要學他們科學的物質文明，而且更要學他們的道德精神，處處能自愛，時時能自重，這樣纔能配得上做他們獨立自由平等的盟友，纔能立於現代國家社會之林，所以我們現在要提高國家的地位，鞏固獨立基礎，一定先要提高我們國民的道德，精神上有了立國的基礎，然後迎頭趕上，而輔以現代科學的智能，那我們建國的工作，就可一日千里的進步，我們中華民國亦就可以永遠確保自由獨立在世界之上了。</p>
<p>同胞們，我今天和各位貝面，要說的話很多，而主要的祗有最後的四句，就是「明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律」，這四句話是我們作一個現在國民的基本條件，我希望上海同胞人人都能身體力行，來作全國同胞的模範，共同一致，完成我們建國的使命。</p>
<h3>外蒙與我政府　樹立外交關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕外蒙人民共和國政府代表蘇龍田布，昨已與我國政府商定正式建立外交關係，互換外交代表，今下午四時，蘇氏再訪王部長世杰，作最後商談，五時赴蘇大使館之鷄尾酒會。該代表等現以任務業經順利完成，日內返國。今下午二時，該代表團曾假勝利大廈招待中外記者，發表介紹外蒙古歷史及現狀之書面報吿。各記者提出問題，均由蘇氏逐一答復。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾張治中周恩來　昨舉行正式會議　會前三人協商製成方案</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十四日電〕軍事三人小組會議，於十四日下午在國府參軍長辦公廳舉行第一次正式會議，共歷四小時許，出席者馬歇爾將軍·張治中部長。周恩來氏。近廿日來三氏會前協商結果，已製成方案，正式會議係就該方案逐項討論，予以明確決定，今日第一次會議結果，可謂圓滿。</p>
<h3>出席復員整軍會議　各將領陸續到京　大會預定三日議程已擬定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕復員整軍會議，將如期在京舉行，已經報到之高級將領有顧祝同·薛岳·劉峙·湯恩伯·張發奎·余漢謀·李漢魂·歐震·馮治安·劉汝明·李延年等五十餘人及軍長·師長·副師長·各軍師參謀長·政治部主任曹確林·王鐵漢·李天霞·羅列·鍾松·趙錫田·　運澤·梁棟新·姚守義·梁爲羣·邵華鉞·李子亮·黃保德·朱席等一百餘人，連各將領隨員計入，已逾四百人。各高級將領一部住勵志社，一部住友人住宅，其餘均分住總部包定之十六大旅社，與會人員每日可領取特備之餐券，持往指定之光明·嵩梁·龍門·金谷·大華及鳳凰十大餐室自由進餐，每客代價聞爲一千二百元，大會終開會期問，將以專車定時接送開會人員。</p>

<h3>勞資與政府三方面折衝　美工潮起伏全世界關懷著圓滿解決的最後一幕</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英特約記者　朱家壽日紐約</p>
<p>記得還在英國的時候，不時跟外國人在旅館的客室裏園爐談天。打開倫敦的報紙，除了議會的辯論，即是到處罷工的消息，大家不由嘆息地說了如今世界大戰結束了，接着就是自已來算賬了，這主要的便是工人和資本家爭；政府也在轉資本家的念頭，　英國的工黨天天在想把若干大企業「國家化，」於是吵得也眞利害，雖然沒有跟我們貴國一樣大家舞動干戈，而形勢也很嚴重，這是經濟的內戰。</p>
<p>傳染性的經濟內戰</p>
<p>到得美國，罷工更見得洋洋大觀了，美國是標準的民主國，也是登峯造極，已經發展到獨佔企業階段的資本主義國家，工業組合不像產業落後國家的瑣碎，工人有罷工自由，只要不違反秩序，誰都無權干涉；因此勞資一旦次裂，如非雙方讓步，很難用別的方法平息下來，這樣美國的工潮不發則已，一發就也不易收拾，所以實際講來，縱在過去戰時，罷工即始終沒有完全靜息，至今大戰結束了，雖然國家正等待着工業復員生產，海外也焦盼着美國的大工業善後救濟，但是社會的矛盾更暴露了，廣大的工人羣的工資收入，儘管比任何國的工人都要僵厚，然而因着要維持戰時生活水準，他們不能不爲自身利益而奮起，與資本家一爭，此時，資本家賺錢雖多，不甘放鬆，於是工潮猝起，再由於工潮的一般性與傳染性，就弄得濁浪滔天，如火燎原，這不是內戰是什麼？</p>
<p>工潮洶湧衝上險峯</p>
<p>美國工潮如以通用汽車事件為準，這回的大風潮就有了二個月的歷史了。通用汽車是美國汽車獨佔巨頭，生產量約佔全國百分之五十一，產品如雪佛蘭別克等，都是我們中國人所熟悉的，但因去年九月起，勞資爭議始終不協，十一月間開始罷工，一直至今不能解決。接着電氣器材製造業，包括我們所熟悉的通用電氣（GE）威斯丁霍斯（Westing　House）在內，也罷了工。再後，肉類包紥業，電話電報，都先後捲入漩渦，使市民吃肉發生問題，美國和海外的電訊交通斷絕，竟供世界名都，若不有新聞社的電訊在維持，簡直變了荒島。而昨天鋼鐵業的罷工，形勢格外顯得惡化了。罷工人數從九十萬左右，（尙有其他次要業故有此數）突增七十五萬，跳到一百六十萬的紀錄，而且鋼鐵製造是美國主要工業，也是經濟命脈，鋼鐵停工，還將影響其他工業，勢須連帶無工可作，因此影響特別深刻，美國工潮乃又走上一層險惡的巔峯，前途如何，誰也難測了。現在把美國工潮，根據「紐約時報」一月二十日材料，記者彙輯了一個簡表。</p>
<p>委曲求全　迄未解決</p>
<p>這個簡表只長供給一個槪念，當然此中經過不是簡單。譬如肉業工人要求增加每時一角七五，原從二角五分讓步下來。電報業資方限度，乃是政府勞工部提出數字，已由資方承認，而勞方不予贊同。尤其如汽車業，跟鋼鐵業，後來都經政府時設事實調查委員會擬出數字，而資方不允，故形成僵局，特別拿鋼鐵業說吧：罷工雖猶上月廿一日上午零點的事，爭持原已很久。從去年九月十一日起，工人提出每時加薪二角五分之要求，資方即表拒絕，並說如非政府准予鋼價上漲每噸七元，工資無法提高，到十一月二十八日，工人即以五與一之比表決罷工，十二月十一日工會的戰略委員會，當宜布定期一月十四日開始。此時杜魯門總統好不着急，不待立法手續，即遺事實調查委員會調查，以求解決，並表示政府寗可准予加價四元，以免工潮，實在也已委曲求全，得有些「飲鴆止渴」了。然而協議仍難取得，總算工人還肯讓步，先允展期一週罷工，又接受了事實調查會的數字，但資方固執不化，又經杜魯門總統自已擬一數字爲一角八五，可是勞方答應，資方依然不買面子，只有一家五千工人的小公司總算答應，然絕大多數的工人，至此實忍無可忍，於是全面大罷工，就如山洪暴發不可遏止了。</p>
<p>這樣，大規模的全國性重要產業罷工，波及地區的及五分之三，翻開地圖，只有伊沃華，密蘇里，佛羅里達，新墨西哥，奧利功等十七八個州，還沒有工人糾察隊的影跡。此外都已工潮洶湧，人聲喧擾，而旗幟遍街，上至政府，下至庶民，都在爲着這尷尬的局勢發呆，有不知何所措手之感。</p>
<p>基本工業在擱淺中　自然，美國當戰後急待復員生產，從戰時經濟急需回轉到平時經濟的緊要關頭，忽遭這樣氾濫全國的工潮澎湃，無論如何，是絕大的不幸。尤其這些鋼鐵電器汽車，乃是美國工業命脈，以鋼鐵業說，遍佈全國二十五州，戰時雇用工人九十五萬八千人，生產成品估値六十六萬萬，最高產量，凡八千八百萬噸，平時可產五千六百萬噸，佔全世界產量五分之二，乃是最基本的工業。通用汽車和電器業，更是民間日用必需，因此罷工，一九四六年的新車不能出廠，渴望已久的電氣冰箱及無綫電收音機，電爐，電扇，以至電燈泡，都在擱淺之中，當然是美國對外貿易的損失，也是海外外費者的惡訊，「故罷工長比下去，杜魯門固在跳但是事實就不這般簡單了。工人說，現在生活費已經漲高三分之一，而且戰時加工等補貼都在取消，不够生活，再則，根據美國聯邦動負建設局等若千機關統計，如全美工人各加薪百分之十至百分之二十五，依目前資本家謙錢情形，儘有可能，而不致影響物價，工人焉得不想加錢？實在美國的工人程度較好，生活水準亦已相當高，他們自己幷不都是「家無隔宿之糧」之輩，對資本家這些年來發財實况，亦早有數有目，因此提出加薪，實亦大好機會。這裏的工人要求，是係根據資方的支付能力，並非向天討價，同時又申明資方不得一面承認加薪，一面加高貨價，以「羊毛出在羊身上」的老花樣來應付，結果物價上漲，等於不加，這是他們的高明之處。</p>
<p>總統調解　仍歸無效　然而，於今看來，倒是資本底到美時候，但見通用汽車公司的巨幅廣吿，說公司所能負祖不過如此，希望工人快快復工，否則自貽損失，原不算奇；繼後，杜魯門總統的「事實調查委員會」要實地調查，究竟公司能否支付工人要求，以作調解根據，這時資方如果坦白，儘管賬簿公開，豈不痛快，可是不這樣做，一方面拒絕，一方面又登報對調查且加譏刺，當然這僅是總統個人的行政舉措，還未得國會通過，幷無法律効力，於是總統道一記就失敗了。事實調查在鋼鐵業上面，結果是一樣的，所擬出的折衷案，資方不理，連杜總統最後直接所擬數字，還是如此，據說是怕鋼價漲了，影響一般經濟失常，馴致通貨膨脹，再則妨害對外輸出，理由也很堂皇。不過　結僅有一個，資方是否眞能盡其所能，支付新增工資，抑是一定要在某種利潤的標準下酌量「施捨」，只有資本家自己曉得。</p>
<p>電報罷工照常收發　工潮相持不下，資本家少賺錢，當然不便宜。然過去荷包都滿，自然切身影響最少，工人固然不全是窮光蛋，然工資損失，乃是實際問題。頂受影響的着還算一般消費者。據統計，因電報工潮，紐約的商業已大打折扣，即其一例。今天紐約的地下火車，高架火車，以及公共汽車，電車，都有罷工威脅，那麼直使紐約變成死市，索性一切都停頓起來，這中間工人的地位就暴露了矛盾了，你們究竟對付資本家呢？還是對付一般無辜的平民？資本家系的報紙儘在責備工人，工人的處境確有爲難，因爲非此不足促資方覺醒，但直接影響，徒使第三者廣大的消費羣苦惱。這樣，美國的工人究竟有頭腦，譬如肉業工人，他們正在計劃開工三廠，以維市民最低需要，如軍隊醫院更照常不間，電報工人雖然罷工，凡緊急事件依然收發，美國勞工在這些地方値得欽佩。</p>
<p>勞工舉措印象良好</p>
<p>目前的問題是長此罷工下去將怎麼校？　伯納對罷工問題原曾說得爽快：「如果勞資兩方長此相持，首先餓肚子的是工人。」現在事實擺得明自。工人步步退跟，獨是資方寸步難移，理由上面已說，因為影響最深，並不是他們，所以儘可好整以閒，以逸待勞，等到工人餓肚子，政府也跳脚跳得不像樣了，自會有最好的條件出來，那時就自然而然，不費力地解次了。此時慌亂，徒貽損失，實屬不智，大槪資本家的心情正是這樣，他們希望工人總有呌饒一天，同時國會議員們也會被逼制出强制工人復工的法律來，這時機會就來了。</p>
<p>可是這兩種趨勢以一般看法，恐猶不能，至少時機太不成熟。第一工人這回有的是罷工資本，即使擴日持久而吃光用光，歐美社會都有生活保險，而且工人有工人骨氣，恐不致遠而出此。再則，一看美國的工會組織，力量確實偉大，尤在罷工時期，齊心一致團結奮鬥，工會的領袖也有本事，這回的事折衝樽俎，舉措得當，並未予人不良印象，可卜他們的目的畢竟可得同情。</p>
<p>最後一幕政府主演　至於美政府的態度，不偏不倚，本最為難，而且總統和議會，身負國鈞之重，不能不高瞻遠矚，明敏應付，一方面要顧到勞資本身利益，尤其重要的，應注意全盤經濟後果。議會訂立禁止罷工法案等建議，已被與論攻擊，勢將不致出此，至多檢討以往勞工法令，加强團體協約效能，道倒是一般要求，或有可能。但顯然，這是不能不溫和的。現在杜魯門和議會之間，恰恰也有些　扭，總統建議多端，議會老是推推拖拖，杜魯門年初演說，早已提及此點，這番處理工潮，如事實調查制度等，也不知議會何日始可通過，使杜魯門更增困惱。因爲在他手中贏得了戰爭的勝利，他却最不放心在應付工潮中反失却光輝，他現在並不担憂工人會暴動起來，因爲這在美國還不會的，却是時時刻刻焦慮着，影響整個內外經濟的通貨臌脹的黑影，也許已在他面前搖曳，故總統羅斯福的反臌脹案過去了，此刻却正出現在杜魯門的週遭，這是有關美國戰後國運，當然也是杜總統的威望與前途所緊，看杜魯門怎樣應付資本家，這是最後一幕，値得我們注意的。（一·二日）</p>

<h3>永遠保存獨立自由！　我們必須不負　主席的屬望</h3>
<p>上海五百萬市民愛國的熱忱，擁護　蔣主席的至誠，完全在昨天下午跑馬廳歡迎大會中表現出來了！會期爲三點鐘，而午飯時間就萬人空巷，　欲一瞻主席丰采。不到兩點鐘，二三十萬人已經走進了跑馬廳，外面還是人山人海。馬路上，車廂上，屋頂上，環繞着跑馬廳的四週，沒有一塊缺地不是萬頭攢動。</p>
<p>主席進塲以及離會時的歡呼，主席訓話時左面萬千羣衆的破籬而入，後面許多學生工人時時想擠到前面來，在在表露着無數老百姓仰望　主席天眞爛熳的精神。眞如耆老顏惠　氏所說，上海市民今天猶如孤兒之重見父母。</p>
<p>主席昨天對市民的訓話，他以爲是彷彿在家庭中的談話一樣。他體味到數十萬羣衆的熟情；他心目中並不把他們只當市民看，却視同父老伯叔兄弟姊妹和子女，而羣衆對　主席也似有同感。記者在散會離塲時，親自逢到一位七十八歲的老翁，在前擁後擠的羣衆中幾乎被推倒，幸面躲到牆邊，就喘息着向人說，「好險啊總算遠遠的望着了！主席神采奕奕，還像當年的健旺，中國是有望的！」啊！這是什麼呼聲？老百姓簡直　　主席象徵着中華民國了！不錯，一些兒不錯，有　主席在，中國今天爭得了獨立自由；有</p>
<p>主席在，中國人民還能繼續跟着努力，維獲中國的獨立自由。中國人一天享受着獨立自由的幸福，就一天忘不了主席。</p>
<p>可是僅僅愛戴擁護，遠不能算是我們國民已經盡了天戰。國家是大家的，是人民的；我們人人有分，也人人有責。　主席說，我們因爲無數先烈革命的成功，因爲無數將士民衆抗戰的勝利，我們纔得取消不平等條約，我們纔能在跑馬　開這麼一個大會。　主席說那些話，我們相信他有說不盡的歡愉，也蘊蓄着無限的感觸。我們聽了，回想當年，「十里洋塲，」「華人與狗不得入內」的吿白，也不免在興奮中暗吞下幾滴眼淚！人是有感情的，也有理智的。我們在感情激動之餘，聽了主席「爭得了獨立自由以後，務必要永遠保存獨立自由。」的大聲疾呼，難道仍可無動於中，不憑我們的理智，思索一下怎樣才可不辜負主席殷切沉重的期望麼？</p>
<p>中國古來就有一句話，「創業難，守成亦不易。」革命是創業，建設是守成。抗戰是創業；建國是守成。取消不平等條約，爭回獨立自由，是創業；永遠保存獨立自由，不使再陷於不平等的地位，是守成。主席昨天說，爭取獨立自由固難，而保存獨立自由尤不易。語重心長，感慨萬千。世界人類，生而平等；任何國家，原本都是獨立自由的。何况中國，炎黃裔胃，開化獨早，而何以降及淸季，淪而爲次殖民地？自伐人伐，自　人　，從古已然，於今爲烈。中國從前獨立自山的喪失，中國人民自喪失之！中國今天獨立自山的取得，亦由中國人民五十年來黝頭流血革命抗戰以取得之！昨天跑馬　的開會，象徵着中國已解脫了次殖民地的枷銷。這不是無代價，乃付出絕大的代價的。我們足踐跑馬　的一寸土地，我們就懷念自興中會同盟會以來中國國民黨革命精神之所賜，就要立志永遠保障中國全國領土主權的完整！我們次不以爭得眼前的獨立自由爲止境，我們也次不存心妨害或侵犯他國的獨立自由，但我們必須如　主席所　示，永遠保存中國的獨立自由而勿使再失。</p>
<p>主席昨天訓話時間雖短，而詞極重要。他吿訴了我們革命的歷史與成果，他指示了我們保存獨立自由的不二法門。他說只要人人能「明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律，」中國的獨立自由就可永遠保存，不虞再失。也許有人以爲這還是老生常談，並無奇妙，而不知布帛栗菽，就是人們天天衣食之所需。可惜一部分浮薄少年，見事不明，讀書不多，只知好新眩異，追風逐影，一聽得禮義廉恥責任紀律的金玉良言，或且掉頭不顧。這與民國八九年間，大談「非孝」誤以爲此即新潮者何異？我們聽說最近有少數學生，盲目附和，要求不讀三民主義，不讀　主席訓詞，以爲這樣纔呌自由。我們眞不懂：國人已一致公認三民主義為建國之最高準繩，而何以要鼓動靑年不去研究？國人已一致公認必須在　主席領導之下來從事和平建國，而何以又輕視　主席的嘉言？明明中國是由三民主義的呼喚而救起來的，明明中國五十年來的革命抗戰是由於　國父與　主席的先後領導而達於成功的，我們實貴珍重之不暇，而豈忍棄如敝屣！禮是規矩的態度；義是正當的行爲；廉是淸白的辨別；恥是切實的覺悟。我們試問：我們要永遠保存獨立自由，可以不規矩，不正當，不淸白，不切實嗎？可以從這些字的反面去求到嗎？至於革命建國，艱難偉大，人所共知，如果羣相推諉，規避責任，一盤散沙，藐視紀律，則烏合之衆，一鬨之市，又豈能期其有成？今天大家講民主，大家談自由。民主自由，誰不愛好？然而民主的精神就在自我對社會負責。若祇知放言高論，絕不顧及實際情况，則民主所屆，築室道謀，還能辦成一件事嗎？自由的精義就在羣已各有權界。若只許我有自由，絕不顧及他人權利，則法紀蕩然，藩籬盡破，社會且閙成一團糟，安定尙不可望，更何有於　設？</p>
<p>獨立呀！自由呀！五十年爭來不易！幾多　血，幾多頭顧，幾多生命財產，爲此獨立自由而犧牲了！我們在偉大的領袖　蔣主席領導之下，抗戰八年，光明重見。獨立之花，自由之果，芬芳甘美，傳之無窮。我們謹祝　主席　康，尤願國人努力！</p>

<h3>瘋狂的投機　黃金一百六十一萬　美鈔二千二百二十</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因陪都中行停售黃金，向財部請示中，人心受此刺激，更爲激昻，投機家認爲當局政策，有根本動搖之象，游資羣趨黃金，證券帮可動用之資金，幾全部用　，不顧暗息昻達二角以上之威脅，孤注一擲，中途奇俏，竟創一六一萬新高價，始逐漸回落，查晨初喊價即在混亂中狂跳至一五九萬，而後受多頭獲利了結所壓小，在一五四萬左右徘徊殊久，迨後某大戶對美鈔突來猛烈補空，美鈔市價自二一五〇元直綫暴騰至二二二〇元，（此價證券大樓以外恐未做過）激動金價不少，再暴漲至一六一萬左右，銀行方面逢高脫手，錢兌業亦塞出大量美鈔，業中停做隔日交易，午刻浮多不支，遂破一五大關見一四五萬而後略形平穩，午收一五〇萬五，較前收再漲十一萬，午後業中泰半停做，但場外仍有暗盤交易，隔日交割，自一五三萬五低至一四七萬，最後仍在一五〇萬大關外盤旋，陪都掛牌有改十二萬五之傳說，人心微現忐忑，飾金掛牌十六萬，紋銀一千六，銀元九百元，暗拆自一角半至二角二分不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔初開即升至二千元外，買戶連袂而來，金市暴騰，套價又拔開至七三〇元以上，套頭活動紗布帮買意仍濃，逐步漲高，迨後大戶軋空，竟漲到二二二〇元，錢兌業趁高猛力塞出，午後在二〇八〇元前後掙扎，結果較前收猛漲一六〇元，港票續堅，惟新貨一百元大關難以站定，結果老貨再好卅元，新貨好四元</p>
<h3>證券不蒙靑睞　昨一律瀉</h3>
<p>昨公債市况較爲闌珊，投機活動顧而之他，初堅後疲，顯受華股方面不便之影饗，供過於求，丙種自二一〇〇元盤小至一八〇〇元，午收一八五〇元，前後盤旋，結果甲乙各跌七十元，丙九十元，丁一百元戊種跌六十元。</p>
<p>華股因有外來干涉，行動微見不便，銀根極緊，投機旣傾向黃金，頗多脫股就金之流，永紗自二六五〇元左右，美亞二〇八〇元，景福一四五元盤旋而下，午收都以低價結束，結果較前收計永紗跌三三〇元，美亞跌四三〇元，景福等三小熱跌三元至九元不等，冷門亦跟跌半成左右，收後浮多迫於銀根，續來斬售；喊價再低。</p>
<p>外股因有金市助力，上場一度挺俏，怡紗見六五〇〇元，會德豐一六五〇〇元，業廣三〇〇〇元，英聯八九〇〇元，怡啤二三〇〇元，亞洲一八〇〇元後始有供給，迨夫證券帮受銀根迫殺，近午賣風漸熾，同時金市亦回，午收都以低價收市，較前收微見回挫。</p>

<p>昨日現棉交易愈暢，市勢頻昂不已，絲紡建公司採辦細絨花原料甚殷，美棉米得林花一牌竟占八九百件之多，悉數爲四十二支及卅二支細絨等原料，此外本花原料亦有相當吸胃，故各花一致又昂二三千元之鉅。</p>
<p>金市直綫上漲之際，布市乃隨之齊放光輝，全日僅小路客帮交易點綴市場，漲度尙不致如紗市之烈，少數染織廠拋售下月份期貨，藉收抑平物價之效，各市平均較上日漲二三千元之譜。</p>

<h3>廠經各檔均高　人造絲交易稀</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市一二〇號天橋現貨上午做到二百十五萬元，棧單跟進做一百三十八萬元，銀根奇緊，下午吿回，現貨喊二百十萬元，毫無交易，棧單一百念八萬元，略有成交，廠經各檔均漲起百分之十左右，高五担貨成交價二百四十五萬元，綢貨美亞被面每百條較上日高十萬元，洪康大誠格璧縐價較平，每碼漲起百餘元，民生織錦緞每件一萬五千元有成交。</p>
<h3>柏油蒸蒸日上</h3>
<p>柏油紅盤後，各產地報價均趨漲勢，蘭金一帶已加至三萬六千元，杭行前三日來申售開浦江尖貨四萬一千元，聞昨訊又漲四萬三千元，嘉興本車前日尙祇四萬八干元，昨日已開五萬元，均嘉興硤石交貨，惟運費較一月份又加二三成，故成本更高，現行家售本車柏油五萬八千元，內坪五萬四千元，的干蘭油四萬七八千元，米心川占一百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>茶價一路前進</h3>
<p>紅綠茶花色，邇來實銷蟬聯，蘇州帮竟有來者不拒之勢，津帮日內亦擬捲土重來，惟市上存底依然涸薄，因之執貨者莫不認爲奇貨可居，是以連日趨勢鋒鋩異常，茉莉頂雙薰每担已竄出三十五萬元大關，上品徽烘靑亦創新高價，其他花色毫不回顧，至於菊花一項廣帮注視力更見趨緊。</p>
<h3>刦餘紗布　已被處分說</h3>
<p>紗布廠商，前爲敵偽强迫收買紗布，尙有二百餘萬疋，由僞商統會移交敵僞產業處理局，染織業及紗業棉布業等三同業公會屢向各主管機關申請發還，蔣主席此次來滬，聞亦有呈文遞進，但昨據有關方面透露消息，軍政部近須徴用棉布一百六十萬疋，敵產局將會同海關點交六十萬疋，並擬在美國運來之布疋中，撥交一百萬疋，此六十萬疋，據云即係僞商統會移交之刧餘品，惟其種類，槪屬花色貨，軍政部未必合用云，據上開三公會消息，宋院長前曾表示可依法理解次，各會員因紛紛向會要求，速在法理範圍內，向上級機關暨司法機關謀有效之救濟，希望政府對此，鄭重處理，軍政部如需要布疋，可向原物主結價，不宜混統以敵產方式收用，致引起商民誤會。</p>

<h3>朿華偏師應戰　受挫於英海軍　一對二先勝後敗</h3>
<p>東華爲操練兵馬起見，昨約英海軍作友誼賽，一方面亦使一般新將上塲，藉得練習機會，故戴麟經孫錦順等俱作旁觀，而未戎裝臨陣。昨天氣殊好，故雖屬友賽，膠園內亦倍見熱鬧，惜乎東華未能用最佳陣容，徒使一般愛看勝球之球迷，掃興而回。</p>
<p>比賽開始後，英軍因係新軍，聯絡未見純熟，東華努力作戰下，韓龍海開紀錄，一對〇結束上半時。下半時英軍後勁殊屬可畏，東華後防乃威多事，林文虎先闖下大禍，誤犯手球，由麥克勞登主罰中的，造成各一後，英軍賈其餘勇，陶爾斯施威，建立功勸，二對一後來居上，東華嗣後雖多攻勢，終未能擊破敵網，直至終塲，東華以一對二敗於英海軍。</p>
<h3>今晚籃球聯賽</h3>
<p>今晚籃球聯賽三塲，甲一部華南對汕隊，過去兩隊相逢，各有勝負，蓋其戰路相同，自未能作賽前斷語，須視當時之情形如何。女組雪紅與靑聯，俱係新典小將，今戰勝者得免殿軍之席，觀變方實力，均甚幼稚，亦旗鼓相當之戰也。另幕甲二部紅隊逢V隊，前者甫克絲林，挾其餘威，V隊恐難逃敗績。今日秩序如左</p>
<p>雪紅—靑聯（女子）五時卅分</p>
<p>紅隊—V隊（甲二）六時一刻</p>
<p>華南—汕隊（甲一）七時一刻</p>
<h3>足球委會促各隊　注意運動道德</h3>

<h3>漫談偉大作品和作家生活</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>「爲什麼中國到現在還沒有產生偉大作品？」——這問題，據我所知，遠在抗戰以前，就已被很認眞地提出來討輪過了。</p>
<p>自從抗戰爆發以後，在大後方，也不時被提說着。如今，抗戰總算勝利了，這問題，也許不久又要被認眞地提出來加以熱烈的討論。</p>
<p>的確，假如我們承認文藝作品是客觀現實的反映的話，那末，中國早就應該，而且非常可能地產生出偉大作品來了。</p>
<p>然而，却似乎一直沒有產生過，——這問題直到現在還不時被人提出，而且還可能一直被討論下去，便是個頂好的反證；——這究竟是什麼原因呢？</p>
<p>自然，原因可能有多種——如我國新文學運動的歷史還太短，，作家體騐過於偏枯，以及作家的表現技術一般地還沒有達到必要的水準，乃至於時常不能不受到某些客觀條件的制約……等等——而跟作家們的現實生活環境顯然也大有關係。</p>
<p>這話怎麼說呢？——</p>
<p>我們知道：寫文章（從事文藝創作），雖然絕非移山塡海般的困難，但也次不能認爲跟抽燜喝茶樣的輕而易舉。儘管你有過人的才能，豐富的體騐，出色的題材……但，如果你沒有比較寬裕的時間去構思，去加以剪裁，如果你沒有比較淸靜的環境（儘管是差堪容膝的斗室也無妨），如果你沒有比較飽滿的精力容許你不斷地加以修改和錘鍊……那就不但偉大作品絕對產生不出來，恐怕就連並不「偉大」，甚至於「渺小」的東西，也勢將難產了。</p>
<p>可是，一般中國作家的生活環境究竟是怎麼一種情形呢！大家都在閙窮，許多都在害病！作家和貧病這位仁兄，簡直永遠像一對對多情的新婚愛侶，眞個是難捨難分！事實上能够完全靠寫作吃飯的「專業作家」簡直十小得一二（而他們或她們的窮苦情形，也次非局外人所能想像於萬一！），此外一律是「業餘作家」，他們都不能不爲着每天的開門七件事而痛心地把最好的時間和精神大部份化費在辦公室，教室，甚或工廠，商店裏面，然後才能保證自身及妻子兒女勉强地免於餓死，免於凍殭，才能挖空心思，忙裏偸閒，或在等因奉此之餘，或在更殘人倦之際，硬着頭皮，執筆寫作……戰前如此，戰後更是這樣！如今抗戰雖然業經勝利在案，但將來情况究竟如何，實未便妄加推測，而至少在目前尚未見其有絲毫之好轉。並且，一般地說來還不免有過之而無不及！這却是有目共覩，有耳同聞的鐵一般的事實！次無造謠生事等情！</p>
<p>在這種情况下面，老實說，祇要他們或她們不作葉紫，王魯彥，謝六逸，蕭紅第二，第三，第四，……就已經不能不說是一權稀有的「奇蹟」，也可以說是「福大命大」了，那裏還談得上什麼「偉大的作品」！</p>
<p>所以，時至今日，「爲什麼中國到現在還沒有產生偉大作品？」——這一問題。誠然很值得」提出來加以討論；但在提起它之前，更應當念切地被提到的，却似乎還是：「要怎樣才能使中國作家在生活環境上有可能產生律大作品？」</p>
<p>而且，我敢斷定：祗有首先解次了這一根本問題之後，然後才能談及其他，想及其他；否則，不管你怎棵熱烈地加以討論和研究，而偉大作品也依舊和我們距離得交關長遠！交關長遠！簡直比太陽距離地球還要長遠！</p>
<p>你先生不是由衷地希望馬兒跑得快而且跑得好嗎？但你却運草都捨不得給牠吃飽！這實在未免有點太那個了吧？是不是？</p>
<h3>牆子河的水</h3>
<p>— 淩星</p>
<p>有三個到天津去遊歷的外鄉人，回轉來的時候，對牆子河的水有三種不同的印象。一個說：牆子河的水濃黑惡臭，令人掩鼻而過。另一個說：牆子河的水好比一泓泥漿，祇有泥水匠對牠有好感。第三個說：牆子河的水澄做無比，內有遊魚可數。我對於他們三個人有一個共同的印象，他們都沒有認識牆子河。</p>
<p>至於我自己，在十餘年中，往返天津二十餘次，我才完全認識牆子河。</p>
<p>第一次，由南開女中踱過那條黃土的隴道，我看見一彎溪水。別人吿訴我：這是牆子河。由這一天起，我愛上了牠，我愛上了河岸泥塗的楊柳，我愛上了那澄澈的河水，河水裏的魚，還有浮在水面的遊艇，甚至由遠處緩緩爬過來的斜陽，斜陽爬過來的時候，河水便漾起赤金色的波瀾，許多許多種明亮的色澤在那裏閃鑠。於是，每天晚飯後，便習慣於在牆子河畔踱過薄暮，如果有一兩個朋友，便租一隻遊艇，浮蕩到八里台，在河面上帶回殘陽的鱗波。但那時候還是孩子，祇有後來才對回憶有所憐惜，戰事之後，那裏是一片瓦礫場的久緣，有敵國兵士的哨崗，許不邊再是遊賞的地方，想要到那裏去尋夢，倒不如在夢裏去尋牠了。</p>
<p>不過有一個機緣，看見牆子河水的另一面，因爲戰事把天津的租界渲染得更繁榮了，好懺有這樣的一個感覺：如果你要到天津去，那麼必是到天津的租界去，那裏的英租界有兩條路最著名，一條呌做倫敦道，便是現在改稱爲美齡路的，好像是比倫敦道這三個字更美麗了。還有一條，便是牆子河道，後來別的路都數度更名，有的改得很難記憶，牆子河道却祗改爲牆子河路，便再沒有變更。我第一次，那是在夏天，穿過耀華橋，看見這裏的牆子河水，正如上面所說：濃黑得彷彿是墨汁，有一股濃重的惡臭蒸騰到橋面上來，但是堤岸上，有　花，有洋槐，還有一條石子舖成的路，一堆土山，一座小亭，後來我發現夜裏居然還有人携了蒲扇，在這河邊乘凉。因爲我和萱曾經在這河邊散步，所以對這濃黑的河水並無惡感，牠帶給我的，時常是一般優美的回憶，和苦戀的懷想。</p>
<p>至於那黃泥水般的牆子河，倒要有相當的機緣才能看見，必須由天津搭乘出口的輪船，在和海河的匯交處，有人指着一般滔滔滾來的黃水說：「你看，道也是牆子河！」也必須有這樣的一個人指示，不然次不會認識，因爲牠完全變了，不再那麼文靜，沒有塒花，楊柳，土山，茅亭。河水澎湃，也襯不起斜陽的幽趣了，何况這是在船上，一般離愁別緒，常攪得詩人不再有詩意，旅人的哀愁就全寄託在遙遠的旅途上了。</p>
<p>一個擅於繪飾詞藻的人一定會把牆子河的水潤飾得很美麗可愛。因爲這是一條多變的山河，唯其小，才可愛，才可玩賞，唯其多變，就可以任其愛好而抉擇了。假使有一段美麗溫婉的回憶，牆子河將會人格化起來，永遠不能忘記。</p>
<p>用文字來誇耀牆子河是不可靠的，但也莫用世俗的眼來看，有一位天津朋友向我誇耀他們的牆子河說：「牆子河好，旁邊那條馬路多寬，多平坦，別處就沒有！」對了，他說的太對，不過你能沒有啼笑皆非之感嗎？他的牆子河是那一泓臭水旁的柏油路，如果我們這裏說的是牆子河的水，他那條河裏沒有水。</p>

<p>這年頭兒認眞不了許多，只有過一天算一天。今日有酒今日醉，今天有烟今日吸！</p>
<p>翁老爺確是這樣，從好的方面講，他爲人很達觀；從壞的方面講，他爲人就不及墨老爺有志氣。雖然墨老爺也還是委屈求全地茍延着，但他心裏究竟不甘願的。一個人有牢騷，也就是有志氣。翁老爺絕不牢騷，他很能安命自如，因此他倒少了許多煩惱。</p>
<p>他們正談得起勁的時候，翁二太太來了，一進門便嚷着：</p>
<p>「你們哥兒倆在談什麼呀？應，一邊喝酒，一邊聊天，眞會享福！」說罷，從翁老爺的手裏奪過了烟袋，狠狠地駡了一句：「烟鬼！」</p>
<p>墨老爺笑着站起來讓翁二太太坐。</p>
<p>「我今兒高興，特地請了老兄弟來喝鐘喜酒。怎麼樣？愈也喝一種吧？」</p>
<p>「不成！不成！我可不會喝酒。「翁二太太扭揑地說着，一屁股坐在翁老爺身旁。</p>
<p>「大哥，再等幾個月，我也要請您喝喜酒了！」</p>
<p>「是嗎？弟婦已經——」墨老爺說了半截，又覺得怪不好意思地，於是連忙打住了。</p>
<p>「別聽這個烟鬼的話，大哥！」翁二太太又氣又羞地在翁老爺身上悄悄擰了一把。</p>
<p>「噯喲！」翁老爺不禁呌了一聲。仍然笑着說：「大哥又不是外人，怕什麼羞！敢明兒要是生個兒子，少不得還攀上親戚了哩！大哥，他們「指腹爲婚」，你贊成不贊成？」</p>

<h3>Chairman Summons Xi Yushu Yesterday Morning, Inquiring About Opinions on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices; Afternoon Tea Reception for Various Envoys</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, City News] The Chairman's visit to Shanghai is now on its fourth day, and the citizens' love, protection, and enthusiastic emotions are increasingly evident. National flags fly throughout the city, and all conversations and news on the streets and in the alleys are about the Chairman's life achievements and the grand occasion of this visit. The Chairman is extremely concerned about Shanghai's commodity prices, especially the recent soaring gold prices. He specifically summoned Councilor Xi Yushu at 10:20 yesterday morning to inquire about opinions on suppressing and stabilizing prices, as a reference for the government to stabilize prices. Mr. Xi gave the Chairman a detailed report on the fluctuations in commodity prices in the city and the previous proposed plans, and he left after about fifteen minutes. The Chairman originally scheduled to summon all officers above the rank of regimental commander in the Shanghai garrison and all officers above the rank of branch director in the municipal police bureau at 11:00 yesterday morning for a lecture. However, this was temporarily canceled because all military and police officers were preparing to attend the welcome rally at 3:00 in the afternoon and had to be responsible for maintaining order at the rally. At 11:10, the Chairman and his wife went for a walk in the suburbs by car and returned to the official residence at 1:05 pm. At 3:00 pm, he attended the welcome rally. Whenever the Chairman and his wife's car passed, cheers resounded through the sky. After the Chairman finished speaking at the rally at 3:25, he returned directly to his official residence. At 5:00 pm, he met with Commander Wiley of the British Navy's HMS Ophalas. At 5:30 pm, the Chairman and his wife invited the Argentine Ambassador and his wife, the Dutch Ambassador and his wife, and the Portuguese Minister and his wife to a tea party at the official residence, accompanied by Mayor Qian and others. Around 7:00 pm, the distinguished guests successively took their leave.

The date of the Chairman's departure from Shanghai to Nanjing has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred Thousand Citizens Burst with Enthusiasm, Welcome Rally Unprecedented, Chairman and Wife Personally Attend and Deliver Earnest Instructions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, City News] Five million citizens of Shanghai held an unprecedented grand welcome rally at the Racecourse yesterday to welcome Chairman Chiang's first visit to Shanghai after the victory. The weather was clear and sunny, adding to the enthusiastic atmosphere. Yesterday's grand event was unprecedented in Shanghai. The citizens, out of respect and gratitude for the Chairman's great achievements, looked forward to seeing the demeanor of the generation's great man, whom they had not seen for eight years and who was always on their minds. Therefore, all districts of the city were deserted, especially the Nanjing Road area, which was packed with people and traffic was blocked. Cheers and firecrackers blended together, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic situation. The rally venue was largely set up the night before, simple, solemn, and beautiful. More than two hundred organizations participated in the rally, divided by their nature into six categories: vocational trade unions, industrial trade unions, trade associations, special associations, freelance professional groups, and party and government agencies, plus students and freely participating civilians, totaling over two hundred thousand people. Around 1:00 pm, the participating organizations began to line up and enter the venue in an orderly manner, each occupying its designated position. With such a large number of participants and such a grand scene, the order was remarkably good, setting a precedent for the city. The Chairman and his wife, accompanied by aides and Mayor Qian, arrived at the venue at 3:00 pm. Millions of citizens were overjoyed to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife and were deeply moved by the Chairman's earnest instructions. Therefore, after each segment of the Chairman's speech, they responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. The rally began at 3:00 pm and ended at approximately 3:25 pm. When the Chairman and his wife left the venue and stepped down from the podium, they seemed reluctant to leave the crowd and hesitated to depart. They continued to wave and nod, and the freely participating civilians and a large number of allies crowded forward. Although the military and police tried their best to maintain order, they could not stop the enthusiasm of the masses who loved and admired their leader. The Chairman and his wife left the venue in this moving scene and returned to their official residence by car. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman and Wife Go to the Rally</p>
<p>Around 2:30 pm, Jia'er Road and Hengshan Road were lined with military and police, with strict security. Major General Shen Wanqian, commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, personally commanded the operation. Tens of thousands of civilians stood on both sides of the road, all wanting to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife. At 2:51 pm, the military and police escort vehicle on Hengshan Road was ready to depart. Soon, the Chairman and his wife's special car, followed by Mayor Qian's car and two guard cars, drove out of the official residence. At that time, tens of thousands of civilians on the side of the road responded with enthusiastic cheers to show their respect and welcome to the supreme leader. Seeing the enthusiastic emotions of the civilians, the Chairman and his wife continuously waved from the car and frequently nodded in acknowledgment. After the car passed Linsen West Road, it turned into Changshu Road. The Boy Scout band standing by the roadside began to play music to pay tribute. The Chairman and his wife's special car then passed through Changshu Road and West Zhongzheng Road, turning into Chenghaiwei Road. The crowds on the side of the road were even more crowded, and the cheers and firecrackers were even more enthusiastic. The band also continued to play music, creating the most enthusiastic symphony. At 3:00 pm, the Chairman and his wife's special car arrived at the Racecourse venue on Huangpi Road. The wife got out of the car first, and then Mayor Qian accompanied the Chairman and his wife into the venue, amidst the melodious music and the resounding firecrackers, and ascended the podium to receive the enthusiastic welcome of two hundred thousand citizens.</p>
<p>Extremely Solemn and Beautiful Arrangement</p>
<p>The rally podium was set up at the Racecourse. Huge national flags of the Kuomintang were hung on both sides of the grandstand, and a large white cloth banner about three or four zhang long was hung above, with the twelve large characters "Shanghai All Circles Welcome Chairman's Visit to Shanghai Rally" written on it, visible from afar. In the center of the podium, the national flag of the Kuomintang and a portrait of the Founding Father were hung high. On the right end of the stone steps below the podium was the civil official seating area. Several hundred people, including the top party and government leaders of the city and celebrities from all walks of life, such as Qian Dajun, He Dekui, Peng Xuepei, Wu Shaopeng, Shen Shihua, Xuan Tiewu, and Zhao Zengjue, stood on the stone steps of the civil official seating area. On the left end of the podium was the military official seating area and the diplomatic mission seating area. Many generals gathered in the military official seating area. On the Allied side were General Wedemeyer, Admiral Cooke, General Chennault, and dozens of others. On the National Army side were Lieutenant General Zheng Dongguo, Lieutenant General Li Rulan, and dozens of others. In the diplomatic corps were dozens of people, including the ambassadors of the Allied countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the center of the podium was a brown lectern, with four leather chairs placed behind it. The table was surrounded by potted plants and flowers, and several sound amplifiers were pre-installed. There were three stone steps in front of the table, and the railings on both sides of the middle stone steps were covered with long strips of red, white, and blue cloth. Flowers blossomed under the railings. Stepping down, the press seating area was on the right, and the orchestra seating area was on the left. The entire layout of the venue was solemn and beautiful.</p>
<p>Chairman Frequently Waved</p>
<p>The Racecourse, which was used for horse racing in the past, was vibrated by the cheers of 200,000 people at noon yesterday because all circles in Shanghai were welcoming Chairman Chiang's visit. After 12:00 noon, the organizations and groups participating in the welcome rally lined up and entered the venue one after another. At 2:00 pm, this usually quiet large square was already packed with people. The national flags of the Kuomintang and the horizontal banners with the names of the organizations and institutions prepared by each group fluttered in the breeze under the clear sky and white sun. Tens of millions of civilians outside the venue scrambled to see the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife, blocking the road. Yesterday, all the American and Chinese military police were dispatched, and the reporters inside the venue were very busy. At 2:30 pm, General Wedemeyer, Admiral Cooke, General Chennault, General Brink, and others arrived one after another and waited for the Chairman on the stage with the leaders. At 3:00 pm, the Chairman and his wife, admired by the world, arrived on time, accompanied by Mayor Qian Dajun, and applause thundered immediately. This was an unprecedented scene since the Anti-Japanese War. Chairman Chiang, who had worked hard and made great contributions, immediately waved frequently to the crowd below the stage, who were cheering wildly, and then slowly ascended the stage with his wife, nodding frequently to the crowd. The wife wore a brown sea tiger velvet coat and a red scarf, maintaining a kind smile throughout. The Chairman then delivered a speech to the entire audience lasting 22 minutes. (The original text is in another article.) During the Chairman's speech, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically several times. After the Chairman finished speaking, the applause lasted for several minutes. Finally, the Chairman thanked General Wedemeyer, who was standing on his right, Admiral Cooke, who was on his wife's left, and General Chennault, and expressed his gratitude to the citizens of the city. Then, all the citizens jointly cheered "Long Live Chairman Chiang," "Long Live the Republic of China," and "Long, long live." The ceremony was completed at 3:25 pm. The Chairman and his wife were immediately accompanied by aides out of the Racecourse, and the welcoming civilians dispersed after a long time. Yesterday's grand event in the Racecourse was only seen since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, bringing great excitement to the people of Shanghai. Many Chinese and foreigners who had never seen Chairman Chiang said, "We have finally seen Chairman Chiang and his wife."</p>

<p>慰劳盟军游艺会 昨晚假美琪大戏院举行 主席夫妇两度亲临观剧</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The Chairman and his wife held a variety show to comfort the Allied forces at the Majestic Theatre last night, with Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera performed by Mei Lanfang, Zhang Eyun, and others. The program was extremely exciting. Before 8:00 pm, the invited guests had arrived one after another. Flying Tiger General Chennault, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, senior military officers of the Allied nations, and many social celebrities also attended. At 8:40 pm, the Chairman and his wife arrived, and the military band played loudly. Everyone stood at attention. The Chairman took off his hat, smiled, and frequently nodded to the cheering crowd. The wife wore a black veil with gold trim on her hair, a black velvet long cheongsam, a black woolen coat, and black satin leather shoes, and also smiled and nodded to the crowd, going straight to the third row seats in the middle of the upper deck, which were pre-arranged with embroidered soft cushions. Admiral Cooke was on the Chairman's right, and General Wedemeyer was on the wife's left. There was an empty seat between the Chairman and his wife, with a small table in the middle, covered with a white cloth, with two cups of boiled water and a bouquet of fresh flowers on it. The two rows in front of these five seats were not occupied to avoid obstructing the view. After the embroidered curtain opened, the Chairman immediately took out his white-rimmed glasses from his pocket and put them on, watching the play with a smile. During the intermission, he talked and laughed with Admiral Cooke and General Wedemeyer. Mei Lanfang's "Stabbing at the Home" was originally the finale, but due to time constraints, it was switched with the third play, "Battle of Changsha," and performed first. After the Chairman finished watching "Stabbing at the Home," he left with his wife at 11:05 pm. Everyone stood up to see them off. The Chairman instructed those around him to ask everyone to return to their seats. He then left the seat with his wife, Admiral Cooke, and General Wedemeyer. When the play was about to end at 11:40 pm, the Chairman returned with his wife, and the actors were greatly excited. The performance ended at around 12:00 am.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Chairman's Speech: Restore Inherent Morality, Practice New Life, Safeguard Sovereignty, Maintain Freedom and Independence</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang and his wife attended the full citizen welcome rally yesterday and delivered the following speech amidst the cheers of the crowd: Dear compatriots,</p>
<p>Shanghai is Chiang Kai-shek's hometown. Chiang Kai-shek has been away from his hometown for more than nine years. During these nine years, Shanghai was occupied by the enemy for a full eight years. The men, women, old, and young of Shanghai have suffered the enemy's slaughter and trampling, and have lived a dark and sunless life. Chiang Kai-shek has been thinking of them all the time. Today, after the victory, Chiang Kai-shek has returned to Shanghai and met with all of you compatriots at the Racecourse. I have unlimited feelings in my heart. The compatriots who have come to the meeting today, the older ones are Chiang Kai-shek's fathers and brothers, and the younger ones are Chiang Kai-shek's sons and daughters. Now, when I meet with my fathers, brothers, sons, daughters, sisters-in-law, and sisters, I feel like a family reunion, so I want to offer a few clumsy words from my heart. I hope that all of you compatriots will keep them in mind at all times and work together.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, eight years ago, it would have been impossible to hold a meeting in the Racecourse like we are today. Why can everyone now hold a meeting here freely? Why can I meet with everyone in this place today? This is because the spirit of our compatriots throughout the country in the arduous War of Resistance for eight years has aroused the respect of the Allied nations, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other friendly nations for our military and civilians, and has won the sympathy of the Allied nations. Therefore, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and all the concessions in various places have been recovered. The status of our Republic of China has also gained independence and freedom. However, everyone must know that although the concessions have been recovered and the unequal treaties have been abolished, how can we maintain national sovereignty in the future, and how can we maintain the freedom and independence we have gained? This task of safeguarding and maintaining is more difficult and more arduous than the work of fighting for freedom and independence in the past eight years. In the future, to guarantee national independence and the freedom of the people, we must all strive to practice it. Chiang Kai-shek personally will certainly set an example to advocate for all of you compatriots.</p>
<p>We must be more determined and work harder than during the War of Resistance. After another eight years, we can truly guarantee the foundation of this independence and freedom. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the National Revolution, the Chinese Kuomintang has fought together with our compatriots throughout the country for more than fifty years. Today, it has achieved its goal of national independence and freedom, and Chiang Kai-shek personally has not failed the expectations of our compatriots. However, in the future, the responsibility of guaranteeing national independence and freedom lies on the shoulders of all of you compatriots. Therefore, what I want to remind my compatriots today is that the responsibility of establishing a country and guaranteeing independence in the future must be borne by everyone together.</p>
<p>But how can we guarantee the sovereign independence and freedom of our country, so that we will never lose it again? How can we be worthy of being a free and independent citizen? Regarding this point, I want to specifically point out today, which is what I said at the beginning, that I want everyone to keep in mind at all times and strive to practice the following words: I believe that the most important thing for building the country and guaranteeing independent freedom in the future is to restore China's inherent morality, promote our new spirit of building the country, and practice our new life, to change the numb and sluggish atmosphere. Every one of our compatriots must be enlightened to propriety, righteousness, integrity and honor, be responsible, and abide by discipline. Now, the reason why our Allied nations, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries can become so powerful is entirely because their general citizens have high morals and can automatically take responsibility and abide by discipline for the country, can be selfless, and can forget their families for the country. If we want to stand on an equal footing with all the Allied nations in independence and freedom, we must be as patriotic as they are, as united as they are, as moral as they are, and as spiritual as they are, and we must be able to endure hardship and work hard even more than they are. Therefore, we must not only learn their scientific and material civilization, but also learn their moral spirit. We must be able to love ourselves in all places and respect ourselves at all times. Only in this way can we be worthy of being their independent, free, and equal allies, and can we stand in the modern national and social forest. Therefore, if we want to improve the country's status and consolidate the foundation of independence now, we must first improve the morality of our citizens. If we have a foundation for building the country in spirit, and then catch up with and supplement it with modern scientific intelligence, then our work of building the country can progress by leaps and bounds, and our Republic of China can always ensure freedom and independence in the world.</p>
<p>Compatriots, there are many things I want to say to you today, but the main ones are only the last four sentences, which are "be enlightened to propriety, righteousness, integrity and honor, be responsible, and abide by discipline." These four sentences are the basic conditions for us to be a modern citizen. I hope that all the Shanghai compatriots can put them into practice and be a model for the compatriots throughout the country, and work together to complete our mission of building the country.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] Generals, who have fought hard for eight years without removing their armor, have been summoned to Nanjing to attend the conference, immediately filling the city with a bright atmosphere. Today, reporters met several senior generals, who all expressed their sincere hope for the smooth completion of the demobilization and reorganization work in a frank and cheerful tone. China has clearly entered a new era that is extremely exciting, as can be seen from the light smiles on the faces of the generals attending the conference and the firm and resolute spirit revealed in their conversations. They are all happy to meet with news reporters, but when reporters asked about their thoughts on "news from the defense areas," they all replied in unison, "National affairs should be subject to the government's orders," and "How to complete the demobilization and reorganization should also be subject to the government's orders." Nanjing reporters generally believe that this is a symbol of progress.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Demobilization and Reorganization Conference is about to open in Nanjing.

<p>Before the meeting, a certain organization released a red hydrogen balloon with the national flag and slogan hanging below it. It slowly rose in the venue, symbolizing the gradual improvement of the motherland's status and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang delivered his speech, he earnestly told the citizens to "understand propriety, know shame, be responsible, and observe discipline." This echoed the neon sign "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, Shame" on the roof of the Cathay Hotel. Mayor Qian and Deputy Commander Li smiled at each other upon seeing this.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang was radiant, his voice was loud, and his gaze was sharp. A friend exclaimed, "Not even a trace of his sixty years can be found on the Chairman!"</p>
<p>A worker from a certain yarn factory said to others upon leaving the venue, "I stood for three hours and gloriously saw the Chairman's two waving white gloves." He was very pleased and overjoyed!</p>
<p>A child standing next to the reporter said, looking at the Chairman's constantly waving hand and frequently bowing head, "Chairman Chiang is so amiable and so cute. He is smiling at me!"</p>
<p>The grandstand of the Racecourse will forever be a historic landmark. Although Chairman Chiang has left, the people still linger at the platform, considering it an honor to step onto the platform and stay for a moment on the spot where the Chairman stood.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) The Security Council will convene a meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow (7:00 PM Shanghai time) to discuss another dispute between United Nations members. Syria and Lebanon are expected to strongly demand the simultaneous and complete withdrawal of British and French troops from the Levant (i.e., the Syria-Lebanon region). The Security Council has so far dealt with four disputes between nations. It first discussed the Iranian issue, then encountered the Greek and Indonesian issues, and tomorrow it will discuss the appeals from Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) Today, the Speaker of the Syrian Parliament, Al-Khouri, and the Chief Representative of Lebanon, Frangieh, were officially permitted to attend the Security Council meeting. A fierce debate ensued for ninety minutes, centering on whether the complaints filed by the two countries should be regarded as a "dispute" or a "situation," but no decision was made. After the Security Council adjourned today, there was also a heated debate in the lounge. It is reported that Egypt, as a member of the Arab League, fully supported the complaints of Lebanon and Syria and tried to prevent Britain and France from using their veto power to prevent the Security Council from handling the case.</p>

Bevin also advocated giving the Security Council sufficient time for consideration. As a result, with the approval of eight council members, the US representative's suggestion was passed.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 14th (Broadcast) The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution tonight to strengthen the five powers' efforts to alleviate the world food shortage, requesting the United Nations to pay attention to future food shortages and tighten belts to cope with the difficulties.

<p>[Another Telegram] Bevin said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly yesterday on the world food situation that countries that need to import food need a total of 17 million tons of wheat flour in the first half of this year, but only 12 million tons have been supplied. This is not the final figure, and the actual situation cannot be determined until several weeks later. It is expected that the shortfall will be more than 5 million tons. The lack of rice will cause one billion people to face famine within two months.</p>

<h3>A Step Further in Reforming the World; Colonialism Should Be Eradicated; Mandated Territories Transferred to United Nations Agencies</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] The United Nations has taken another step forward on the long road of reforming the world, hoping that colonialism will no longer exist anywhere. Countless people know that the term colonialism is the root cause of war and suffering. A representative of a certain country at the United Nations General Assembly said that colonialism, in its historical sense, is a struggle for power and oppression of undefended people, and its eradication is the ultimate goal of the territorial independence stipulated in the United Nations Charter. There have been two major developments in this movement: apart from the Union of South Africa, all mandated countries have announced their willingness to transfer the mandated territories to United Nations agencies. As suggested by the United States and seconded by China, the United Nations Charter has stipulated that the welfare of the residents of all colonies and territories of various countries should be taken into account. Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Belgium announced today that they will immediately start preparations so that trusteeship can be implemented when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September. The mandated territories that have been announced for transfer to trusteeship include British Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon (Jordan has been granted independence), French Togoland and Cameroon, Belgian Ruanda-Urundi, Australian New Guinea and Nauru, and New Zealand's Samoa. However, the Union of South Africa stated that German Southwest Africa should be incorporated into the Union of South Africa. After New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser protested, South Africa agreed to reconsider.</p>

<h3>The Brain Trust of Roosevelt's New Deal: Secretary Ickes Resigns; Pauley Affair Cited as Reason for Departure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The White House announced today that President Truman has accepted the resignation of Secretary of the Interior Ickes, effective February 15th. Before a new Interior Secretary is appointed, his duties will temporarily be assumed by Under Secretary Chapman. With Ickes' departure, only two cabinet members remain from the Roosevelt administration: Secretary of Commerce Wallace and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, the latter of whom has also announced his intention to leave the cabinet this year. In his letter to the President, Ickes stated, "Regarding the question of truth or falsehood between Pauley and myself, since Your Excellency was not present during the investigation, and the record-keepers did not have time to read it carefully, Your Excellency, even in your position as President of the United States, cannot make a judgment on this matter. The various forces that previously ruined Fall have a constant effect on any Secretary of the Interior. The Republican Party, long before its great defeat in 1932, disintegrated during Fall's time because it was powerless to resist such political pressure."</p>
<p>Reportedly, Mr. Ickes is 71 years old and has served as Secretary of the Interior for 13 years, also concurrently serving as Public Works Administrator for several years. During the depression, Mr. Ickes used a construction plan worth four billion dollars to provide relief to unemployed workers, building hundreds of water gates across the country, generating a large amount of hydroelectric power to supply vast areas domestically, and laying the foundation for land reclamation projects. All factions of the Roosevelt administration considered Mr. Ickes to be the brain trust of Roosevelt's New Deal, and whenever the New Deal was attacked, Mr. Ickes was always at the forefront.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 14th] Most major American newspapers stated in today's editorials that Ickes' resignation as Interior Secretary would have a negative impact on President Truman's government.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Orders Japanese Government to Transfer Valuables; Dissolves Steel Control Association, Forms New Committee</h3>

The announcement stated that Japanese industrial leaders and government authorities had told Allied officials that they believed it was necessary to psychologically eliminate the "blemishes" of the "wartime industry" in Japanese industry, and that the only way to achieve this goal was to dissolve the Steel Control Association.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Post-War Japanese Life: Drunken Women Wander, Nouveau Riche Splurge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] According to the Kyodo News Agency, six months after the end of the war, all entertainment venues in Japan are thriving, with geishas topping the income tax list. Geishas faced very difficult lives during the war due to bombing and government bans. Entertainment districts in Tokyo, such as Shinbashi, Hakusan, Asakusa, and Yoshiwara, all suffered heavy losses in air raids, but post-war repair work and the construction of temporary housing have been carried out rapidly in Tokyo and other cities to meet the needs of pleasure-seekers. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a survey in early January showed that many Japanese people, especially the tycoons of newly emerging companies, had made fortunes during the war and were therefore squandering money like water, spending as much as 5,000 yen in one night. They are giving up on themselves and spending lavishly to avoid the upcoming property valuation and wartime profit tax. For example, the cost of a meal, accompanied by whiskey and geisha songs and shamisen playing, is 5,000 yen per person. In December, Tokyo's entertainment tax revenue totaled 3 million yen, an increase of 1 million yen compared to the previous month.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Preventing Epidemics: The county government believes that the rivers in Suzhou have not been dredged for a long time, resulting in the accumulation of filth everywhere. Since the beginning of last winter, there has been little rain and snow, and the river water has dried up. Tributary rivers and larger rivers are all shallow and bottomed out, and foul air is overflowing. With the warm weather in spring, there is a deep fear of an epidemic breaking out, causing no small harm. The County Construction Department has specifically formulated a plan to dredge the rivers in the city and suburbs, within the scope of the county's financial resources and manpower, and has obtained approval to implement it selectively. Yesterday, it sent personnel to various rivers in the city and suburbs to conduct investigations, so as to start construction on schedule.</p>

<h3>Davis Transferred: U.S. Consul General to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The State Department announced that President Truman has appointed Davis, the Minister to Denmark, as the Consul General to Shanghai. The current Consul General to Shanghai, George C. Q. Poe, will be transferred to Singapore as Consul General. Davis has served in the U.S. Consulate in China. President Truman recently wrote to Davis, saying that the transfer to Shanghai would allow him to do more for the country, so Davis has resigned as Minister to Denmark and taken up the position of Consul General to Shanghai. Davis's re-transfer to Shanghai as U.S. Consul General is due to the importance of Shanghai, which cannot be handled by anyone other than a capable person in the diplomatic world. Davis has served in the diplomatic world since 1917, and was the Consul General to Shanghai in 1935 and 1936.</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital and Government Tripartite Negotiations: The Rise and Fall of American Labor Strikes; The World is Concerned About the Final Scene of a Satisfactory Resolution</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in England for This Newspaper, Zhu Jiasu, New York</p>
<p>I remember when I was still in England, I often chatted with foreigners in the parlors of hotels. Opening London newspapers, besides parliamentary debates, there were news of strikes everywhere. Everyone sighed and said that now that the World War was over, it was time to settle accounts, mainly between workers and capitalists. The government was also changing the capitalists' minds. The British Labour Party was thinking of "nationalizing" some large enterprises every day, so they argued fiercely. Although there was no large-scale fighting like in our country, the situation was very serious; this was an economic civil war.</p>
<p>Contagious Economic Civil War</p>
<p>Arriving in the United States, strikes were even more spectacular. The United States is a standard democratic country, and also the ultimate capitalist country that has developed to the stage of monopolistic enterprises. Labor unions are not as fragmented as in industrially backward countries. Workers have the freedom to strike, and as long as they do not violate order, no one has the right to interfere. Therefore, once labor and capital split, it is difficult to quell the situation by any other means unless both sides make concessions. Thus, American labor strikes, once they erupt, are not easily resolved. So practically speaking, even during the war, strikes never completely ceased. Now that the war is over, although the country is waiting for industrial recovery and production, and overseas are eagerly awaiting the United States' large-scale industrial reconstruction and relief, social contradictions are even more exposed. The wage income of the vast working class, although thicker than that of workers in any other country, cannot but rise up for their own interests and fight with the capitalists in order to maintain wartime living standards. At this time, the capitalists, although making a lot of money, are unwilling to relax, so labor strikes suddenly arise. Furthermore, due to the generality and contagiousness of labor strikes, they become turbulent and widespread, like a prairie fire. What else is this but a civil war?</p>
<p>The Labor Strike Surge Climbs to a Dangerous Peak</p>
<p>If we take the General Motors incident as a benchmark, this current major strike has a history of two months. General Motors is an American automobile monopoly giant, producing about 51% of the national output. Products such as Chevrolet and Buick are familiar to us Chinese. However, due to labor-capital disputes that have never been resolved since September last year, strikes began in November and have not been resolved to this day. Following this, the electrical equipment manufacturing industry, including the General Electric (GE) and Westinghouse (Westing House) companies that we are familiar with, also went on strike. Later, the meatpacking industry and telephone and telegraph also successively joined the vortex, causing problems for citizens to eat meat, and the United States and overseas telecommunications were cut off, turning it into a world-famous city, but for the fact that news agency telecommunications maintained it, it was simply turned into a desert island. And yesterday, the steel industry strike made the situation particularly worse. The number of strikers suddenly increased by 750,000 from about 900,000 (there are other minor industries that make up this number), jumping to a record of 1.6 million. Moreover, steel manufacturing is a major industry in the United States and also the economic lifeline. The suspension of steel production will also affect other industries, making it necessary to link with no work. Therefore, the impact is particularly profound. The American labor strike has once again climbed to a dangerous peak. No one can predict what the future holds. Now, based on the "New York Times" material of January 20, the reporter has compiled a brief table of American labor strikes.</p>
<p>Seeking Compromise, But Still Unresolved</p>
<p>This brief table only provides a concept, of course the process in this is not simple. For example, meat industry workers demanded an increase of one dime and seven and a half cents per hour, originally retreated from two dimes and five cents. The limit of the telegraph industry's capital side is the number proposed by the government labor department, which has been recognized by the capital side, but the labor side does not agree. Especially like the automobile industry and steel industry, later, the government temporarily set up a fact-finding committee to draft the numbers, but the capital side did not allow it, so it formed a stalemate. Let's take the steel industry as a special example: Although the strike was still the matter of zero o'clock on the morning of the 21st of last month, the dispute had been going on for a long time. From September 11 last year, the workers put forward a request for a salary increase of two dimes and five cents per hour, which the capital side refused, and said that if the government did not approve a steel price increase of seven yuan per ton, wages could not be increased. On November 28, the workers voted to strike in a ratio of five to one. On December 11, the strategic committee of the union announced that it would start on January 14. At this time, President Truman was very anxious. Without waiting for legislative procedures, he sent a fact-finding committee to investigate in order to solve the problem, and said that the government would rather approve a price increase of four yuan in order to avoid labor strikes. It was already a compromise, a bit of "drinking poison to quench thirst." However, an agreement was still difficult to obtain. Fortunately, the workers were willing to make concessions. They first agreed to postpone the strike for a week, and then accepted the figures of the fact-finding committee. But the capital side was stubborn and unyielding. After President Truman himself drafted a number of one dime and eight and a half cents, the labor side agreed, but the capital side still did not buy it. Only a small company with 5,000 workers finally agreed. However, the vast majority of workers could no longer bear it, so the full-scale strike broke out like a flood.</p>
<p>In this way, a large-scale national important industry strike affects areas up to three-fifths. Opening the map, only seventeen or eight states such as Iowa, Missouri, Florida, New Mexico, and Oregon do not have the shadow of workers' picket lines. In addition, labor strikes are surging everywhere, and people are noisy, and flags are all over the streets. From the government to the common people, they are all stunned by this embarrassing situation and have a feeling of not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Basic Industries Adrift: Naturally, the United States urgently needs to restore production after the war. At the critical juncture of rapid transition from wartime economic needs to peacetime economy, it suddenly encountered such a nationwide labor strike surge, which is a great misfortune no matter what. Especially these steel, electrical appliances, and automobiles are the lifeline of American industry. Taking the steel industry as an example, it is distributed in 25 states across the country, employing 958,000 workers during the war, and the estimated value of finished products is 660 million. The highest output is 88 million tons, and the peacetime output is 56 million tons, accounting for two-fifths of the world's output. It is the most basic industry. General Motors and the electrical appliance industry are even more necessities for civilian daily use. Therefore, due to the strike, the new cars of 1946 cannot be produced, and the long-awaited electric refrigerators and radios, electric stoves, electric fans, and even light bulbs are all adrift. Of course, it is a loss for American foreign trade and bad news for overseas consumers. "So the strike is longer than going down, Truman is jumping but the facts are not so simple. The workers said that the cost of living has already increased by one-third, and the wartime processing and other subsidies are being cancelled, which is not enough for living. Furthermore, according to statistics from several agencies such as the US Federal Dynamic Construction Bureau, if all American workers increase their salaries by 10% to 25%, it is possible according to the current capitalists' making money, and it will not affect prices. Why don't the workers want to increase their money? In fact, the level of American workers is better, and the standard of living is already quite high. They themselves are not all "without food for the night," and they have long known the truth about the capitalists' wealth over the years, so they put forward a salary increase, which is also a great opportunity. The workers here demand that it is based on the capital side's ability to pay, not asking for a price from the sky. At the same time, they also stated that the capital side must not admit to the salary increase on the one hand and increase the price of goods on the other hand, using the old trick of "wool coming from sheep," resulting in rising prices, which is equivalent to not adding. This is their cleverness.</p>
<p>President's Mediation Still Ineffective: However, looking at it today, it is the capital that has arrived in the United States. I saw the huge advertisements of General Motors, saying that the company can only afford to pay, hoping that the workers will resume work quickly, otherwise they will suffer losses. It is not surprising. Later, President Truman's "Fact-Finding Committee" wanted to conduct on-site investigations to see if the company could pay the workers' demands as a basis for mediation. At this time, if the capital side was frank, it would not be happy to make the books public. However, they did not do so. On the one hand, they refused, and on the other hand, they published newspapers to ridicule the investigation. Of course, this is only President's personal administrative measure, and has not yet been passed by Congress, and has no legal effect. So President failed once. The fact-finding on the steel industry is the same result. The compromise plan drawn up was ignored by the capital side, even President's final direct number was still the same. It is said that they are afraid that the price of steel will rise and affect the general economic disorders, leading to inflation, and hindering foreign exports. The reasons are also very grand. However, there is only one conclusion: whether the capital side can really do its best to pay new wages, or must "grant" according to a certain profit standard, only the capitalists themselves know.</p>
<p>Telegraph Strike Normal Receiving and Sending: Labor strikes are deadlocked. Of course, it is not cheap for capitalists to make less money. However, in the past, their wallets were full, so the personal impact is the least. Of course, the workers are not all poor, but the loss of wages is a practical problem. The most affected are still the general consumers. According to statistics, due to the telegraph labor strike, New York's business has been greatly discounted, which is one example. Today, New York's subways, elevated trains, and buses and trams are all threatened by strikes, which will make New York a dead city, and everything will stop. In the meantime, the workers' position is exposed to contradictions. Are you dealing with capitalists? Or are you dealing with innocent civilians? The capitalist newspapers are all blaming the workers, and the workers' situation is indeed difficult, because it is not enough to awaken the capital side, but the direct impact only makes the third party a vast consumer group suffer. In this way, American workers have brains after all. For example, meat industry workers, they are planning to open three factories to maintain the minimum needs of the citizens, and military hospitals will still operate as usual. Although the telegraph workers are on strike, they still send and receive emergency events. American workers are worthy of admiration in these places.</p>
<p>Good Impression of Labor Measures</p>
<p>The current problem is what to do if the strike continues for a long time? Bernard once said bluntly about the strike problem: "If the labor and capital sides hold on for a long time, the workers will be the first to go hungry." Now the facts are clear. The workers are retreating step by step, but the capital side is unable to move an inch. The reason has been said above, because the impact is the deepest, it is not them, so they can wait leisurely, waiting for the workers to go hungry, and the government will jump like crazy, and there will be the best conditions to come out, and then it will naturally and effortlessly solve the problem. At this time, panic is only a loss, which is really unwise. Probably the capitalists' mood is like this. They hope that the workers will always have a day of begging for mercy, and at the same time, the congressmen will be forced to make laws to force the workers to resume work, and then the opportunity will come.</p>
<p>However, these two trends, in general opinion, may still not work, at least the timing is too immature. First, the workers this time have a lot of strike capital. Even if it is consumed for a long time, European and American societies have life insurance, and the workers have the backbone of the workers, and I am afraid that they will not go far and come out of this. Secondly, looking at the American union organization, its power is indeed great, especially during the strike period, united and fighting together, and the leaders of the union are also capable. The matter of this time, the negotiations are appropriate, and the measures are appropriate, and it does not give people a bad impression, and it can be predicted that their purpose can be sympathized with after all.</p>
<p>The Last Act is Starred by the Government: As for the attitude of the US government, it is most difficult to be unbiased, and the president and Congress bear the weight of the country, and they must be farsighted and responsive, on the one hand, to take into account the interests of labor and capital, especially important, and should pay attention to the overall economic consequences. The suggestions such as Congress enacting a ban on strike laws have been attacked by public opinion and will not be adopted. At most, it will review the past labor laws and strengthen the effectiveness of group agreements. This is a general requirement, or it may be possible. But obviously, this cannot be anything but gentle. Now there is also some torsion between Truman and Congress. The president has made many suggestions, and Congress has always been procrastinating. Truman mentioned this point in his speech at the beginning of the year. This handling of the labor strikes, such as the fact-finding system, etc., I don't know when Congress can pass it, making Truman even more troubled. Because he won the victory in the war in his hands, he is most uneasy about losing the glory in dealing with the labor strikes. He is not worried that the workers will riot, because this will not happen in the United States, but he is anxious all the time, the black shadow of inflation affecting the entire domestic and foreign economy may already be swaying in front of him, so President Roosevelt's anti-inflation case has passed, but now it is appearing around Truman. This is related to the fate of the United States after the war, and of course, it is closely related to the prestige and future of President. It is worth paying attention to how Truman deals with the capitalists. (January 2nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Forever Preserve Independence and Freedom! We Must Not Fail to Live Up to Chairman's Expectations</h3>
<p>The patriotic enthusiasm of the five million citizens of Shanghai and the utmost sincerity in supporting Chairman Chiang were fully expressed in the welcome meeting held at the racecourse yesterday afternoon! The meeting was scheduled for 3 o'clock, and at lunchtime, the streets were empty as people wanted to catch a glimpse of Chairman's demeanor. Before 2 o'clock, 200,000 to 300,000 people had already entered the racecourse, and outside was still a sea of people. On the roads, in the carriages, on the roofs, and around the racecourse, there was not a single missing spot where tens of thousands of heads were not moving.</p>
<p>The cheers when the Chairman entered and left the arena, the thousands of people on the left side of the Chairman breaking through the fence during the speech, and the many students and workers in the back who always wanted to squeeze to the front, all revealed the countless ordinary people's admiration of Chairman's innocent and sincere spirit. It is as Mr. Yan Hui, an elder, said, the citizens of Shanghai today are like orphans seeing their parents again.</p>
<p>Chairman's speech to the citizens yesterday was like a conversation in the family. He tasted the familiarity of hundreds of thousands of people; he did not regard them as mere citizens, but as elders, uncles, brothers, sisters, and children, and the masses seemed to have the same feeling for Chairman. When the reporter left the arena after the meeting, he personally met an old man of 78 years old, who was almost pushed down in the crowd crowded in front and behind. Fortunately, he dodged to the side of the wall, and then panted and said to people, "What a danger! I finally saw him from afar! Chairman is energetic and still as strong as he was back then. China has hope!" Ah! What is this cry? The ordinary people simply regard Chairman as symbolizing the Republic of China! Yes, some children are not wrong, with Chairman in, China has won independence and freedom today; with</p>
<p>Chairman in, the Chinese people can continue to work hard to maintain China's independence and freedom. The Chinese people will never forget Chairman as long as they enjoy the happiness of independence and freedom for one day.</p>
<p>However, mere love and support are far from being enough for us citizens to have exhausted the battle of heaven. The country belongs to everyone, to the people; we all have a share, and we all have a responsibility. Chairman said that because of the success of countless revolutionary martyrs, because of the victory of countless soldiers and people in the War of Resistance, we were able to abolish the unequal treaties, and we were able to hold such a large meeting at the racecourse. Chairman said those words, we believe that he has endless joy, and also contains unlimited emotion. After listening, we recalled the "ten-mile foreign market" and the declaration that "Chinese and dogs are not allowed in," and we could not help but swallow a few tears in excitement! People have feelings and reason. In addition to emotional excitement, after listening to Chairman's loud call for "After winning independence and freedom, we must always preserve independence and freedom," can we still be indifferent, without using our reason to think about how we can not fail to live up to Chairman's earnest and heavy expectations?</p>
<p>There is an old saying in China, "It is difficult to start a business, and it is not easy to keep it." Revolution is starting a business, and construction is keeping it. The War of Resistance is starting a business; nation-building is keeping it. Abolishing unequal treaties and winning back independence and freedom is starting a business; forever preserving independence and freedom so that it will not fall into an unequal position again is keeping it. Chairman said yesterday that it is difficult to strive for independence and freedom, and it is even more difficult to preserve independence and freedom. The words are earnest and the feelings are immense. All human beings in the world are born equal; any country is originally independent and free. What's more, China, the descendants of Yan and Huang, has been civilized earlier, but why did it decline to the Qing Dynasty and become a semi-colony? Self-cutting people and cutting, self-harming people harm, has been the case since ancient times, and is even more violent today. The loss of China's former independence and freedom was caused by the Chinese people themselves! Today's independence and freedom in China is also obtained by the Chinese people's 50 years of bloody revolution and war of resistance! Yesterday's meeting at the racecourse symbolized that China has freed itself from the shackles of the semi-colony. This is not without a price, but at the cost of a huge price. As we set foot on an inch of land at the racecourse, we remember the gift of the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Kuomintang since the Xingzhonghui Tongmenghui, and we must resolve to always protect the integrity of China's national territorial sovereignty! We will not take the current independence and freedom as the end, nor will we intend to harm or infringe on the independence and freedom of other countries, but we must, as instructed by Chairman, always preserve China's independence and freedom and prevent it from being lost again.</p>
<p>Chairman's speech yesterday was short, but the words were very important. He told us the history and achievements of the revolution, and he pointed out the only way to preserve independence and freedom. He said that as long as everyone can "understand etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline," China's independence and freedom can be permanently preserved, and there is no need to worry about losing it again. Perhaps some people think that this is still old talk, and there is nothing wonderful, but they do not know that cloth, silk, millet, and soybeans are what people need to wear and eat every day. It is a pity that some frivolous young people, who do not understand things, do not read much, only know how to be new and strange, chasing the wind and catching shadows, and when they hear the golden words of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and discipline, they may turn their heads and ignore them. What is the difference between this and the great talk about "non-filial piety" in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, mistakenly thinking that this is the new trend? We heard that recently, a small number of students blindly echoed, asking not to read the Three Principles of the People, not to read Chairman's instructions, thinking that this is called freedom. We really don't understand: the Chinese people have unanimously recognized the Three Principles of the People as the highest standard for nation-building, so why should we encourage young people not to study it? The Chinese people have unanimously recognized that we must engage in peaceful nation-building under Chairman's leadership, so why do we despise Chairman's good words? It is clear that China was saved by the call of the Three Principles of the People, and it is clear that China's 50 years of revolution and War of Resistance have been successful due to the successive leadership of the National Father and Chairman. We really value it so much that we cannot bear to discard it like a shoe! Etiquette is a regular attitude; righteousness is proper behavior; integrity is pure distinction; shame is a real awareness. We ask ourselves: if we want to preserve independence and freedom forever, can we be irregular, improper, impure, or unrealistic? Can we find it from the opposite side of these words? As for the revolution and nation-building, it is difficult and great, which is well known. If we push and shirk each other, evade responsibility, are a mess of sand, and despise discipline, then how can we expect a mob to succeed? Everyone is talking about democracy today, and everyone is talking about freedom. Who does not love democracy and freedom? However, the spirit of democracy lies in self-responsibility to society. If you only know how to speak eloquently and do not consider the actual situation at all, then democracy will be used to build a house on the road, can you still do one thing well? The essence of freedom lies in the fact that everyone has their own rights. If only I am allowed to be free, and I do not consider the rights of others at all, then the law will be gone, the fences will be broken, and society will be a mess. Stability is still unattainable, let alone heaven?</p>
<p>Independence! Freedom! It's not easy to win in 50 years! How much blood, how many heads, how many lives and property were sacrificed for this independence and freedom! Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Chiang, we resisted the war for eight years, and the light was seen again. The flower of independence and the fruit of freedom are fragrant and sweet, and passed down endlessly. We wish Chairman health, and we especially hope that the people of the country will work hard!</p>
<h3>Foreigners Must Also Comply: Household Census Starting Tomorrow, Four Forms Per Household Must Be Filled Accurately, Losses from the War Must Be Noted for Compensation Claims</h3>
<p>The city will begin a comprehensive household census tomorrow. This reporter has learned the following special characteristics of this household census from the Civil Affairs authorities:</p>
<p>Principal and Subsidiary Households Must Both Fill Out Forms</p>
<p>(1) This census does not distinguish between principal and subsidiary households. Each household must accurately fill out four copies of the household form. Foreign households must also comply. (2) Names, ancestral home, age, occupation, etc., must be absolutely accurate and must not be falsely reported, so as to obtain legal protection. Age should be calculated based on actual age. In addition to filling in the name of the original city or county for the ancestral home, the current place of residence can also be filled in. (3) The level of education should be clearly stated, divided into different levels such as university, middle school, and primary school. (4) If there are servants, the servant's seal should also be affixed. Those without seals should add a fingerprint. (5) If a person has two or more residences, it should be noted which place is resided in more often and which less. (6) If there were any losses during the war, the amount of the loss can be noted in the last item of the household survey form as a basis for claiming compensation.</p>
<p>Answer All Questions, Do Not Be Arrogant</p>
<p>It is also learned that during the household census period, the Gu District Office will issue symbol badges to those carrying out the household census to facilitate identification and prevent exploitation by criminals. At the same time, citizens of this city should be absolutely kind to those carrying out the household census, answering all questions and not being arrogant or intentionally making false reports or making false reports on behalf of others. Otherwise, punishment will be imposed in accordance with the detailed rules for the implementation of the household census.</p>
<h3>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Sends a Telex Reply to Shipping Organizations</h3>
<p>Clarifying the Actual Situation of British Vessels Transporting Goods</p>
<p>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan has sent the following telegram to various shipping organizations: To the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the China Merchant Mariners Association, the China Marine Engineers Association, the China Navigation Officers Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the China Pilots Association, and the China Institute of Navigation: Your telegram concerning your concern for shipping rights has been received with admiration. According to the Administration, the amount of relief and rehabilitation materials to be transported this year will be twice the total amount of pre-war international trade imports of our country. However, the ships currently navigating inland rivers have not yet reached one-third of the pre-war level. If special measures are not taken, the inland provinces, such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, etc., will be unable to alleviate their post-war suffering due to the stagnation of materials. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, British company ships are being chartered to transport relief materials. The contract stipulates a term of six months, and if notice of cancellation is given after five months, the contract will expire. The Administration's materials are transported by British ships at an 80% calculated price, and the Administration issues a certificate, and the freight is paid by the British government as a gesture of the British government assisting our country's relief and rehabilitation efforts. The masts bear the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's emblem to indicate that it is not ordinary commercial shipping, and the stern bears the British flag to indicate that the British government and people are also assisting our country's relief and rehabilitation efforts. This is the reason for the British side's request to fly the flag. The Administration has also taken into account the damage to our country's inland river navigation rights and the concern that the British side may use this as an excuse in the future. The British government was solemnly informed beforehand that this cooperative measure would not affect inland river navigation rights and should not be taken as an example, and the British side also expressed its consent. It is hoped that your associations will understand that our country's navigation rights are not being harmed, and will think of the disaster-stricken people in the interior waiting for rescue, and will be able to dispel misunderstandings and be happy to see it succeed. The Administration's concern for both shipping sovereignty and the hardships of relief efforts will also surely be understood. As for ships operated by Chinese people, the Administration is willing to charter them as much as possible. If the Administration abandons domestically available charters and employs foreign ships, it will fail our country's shipping industry, which the Administration will absolutely not do. This is reassuring. Special telegram in reply, hoping for your consideration. Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Pu Mi Chou Yuan Seal.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Social Affairs Explains: Qualifications of Candidates for People's Organizations</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the qualifications of candidates for people's organizations in this city, all parties are well aware: The Ministry of Social Affairs has decided on the above-mentioned candidate qualifications: "The people's organizations belong to private law social personnel and are not public office candidates as defined in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, those who have served in people's organizations under the enemy's organization, if there is no behavior specified in Article 2, Paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, will not be restricted by the preceding article when participating in the reorganized people's organization." This has been communicated by the city's Social Affairs Bureau to various organizations for their information.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Receives New Ships</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the Liberty ship "Hai Zhong" and the Victory ship "Hai Chuan" yesterday. It is reported that the second Liberty ship has been renamed "Hai Xiao" and is scheduled to be received today. The new ships will set sail in succession. "Hai E" is scheduled to sail to the Nanyang Line next Thursday, loading commercial goods and sailing directly to Guangzhou. "Hai Xiang" is planned to sail to the Taiwan Line, but the departure date has not yet been determined. Seven Victory ships have already been received. It is reported that "Hai Dian," "Hai Qian," "Hai Gui," "Hai Ji," etc. will also be received in sequence.</p>
<p>American Ship Arrives in Shanghai. The American President Lines' ship "President Grant" arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and is temporarily docked at the Mobil Wharf. It is scheduled to move to the Bailianjing Wharf this morning. Passengers will transfer to small boats and disembark at the New Customs Wharf at noon.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Qian of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command Speaks on the Jiang Gongmei Case</h3>
<p>Qian, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Woosung Garrison Command, made the following statement yesterday regarding the trial of the Jiang Gongmei case: "The case of Jiang Gongmei, the former captain of the Shanghai Military Police, who was involved in corruption and wrongdoing, has been investigated by this command. Later, at the request of the Military Police Headquarters, it was handed back to that department for handling. Subsequently, an order was received from Chairman Chiang to be strictly handled by this command in accordance with the law. The Military Police Headquarters complied and sent Jiang Gongmei to Shanghai. In order to ensure fairness, this command requested the Army Headquarters to send personnel to organize a military court. The Army Headquarters appointed Senior Staff Officer Li Shenzhi as the presiding judge, and the First Inspection Group of Military Discipline, which was inspecting Shanghai, also appointed military judge Xu Haijing as a judge. However, the main trial authority for this case should undoubtedly belong to this command, according to Chairman Chiang's telegram order. The presiding judge Li Shenzhi made a statement in the newspaper on the tenth before the trial was concluded, and the opinions of the members attending the deliberation were not yet unanimous, so the judgment was hastily made, which is inappropriate. Before this case was submitted for approval, it was illegally announced in the newspaper that Jiang Gongmei was innocent, which is even more illegal. Now that Chairman Chiang has arrived in Shanghai, this command will submit the entire file for review and then proceed in accordance with the instructions.</p>
<h3>Post-War Reconstruction Transportation Actively Promoted: Passenger and Freight Transport on All Lines Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, various transportation agencies are actively promoting the completion of post-war reconstruction transportation. The Highway Administration and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have jointly established post-war reconstruction transportation stations in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Tongguan, and other places. Currently, about 500 people depart from Chongqing every day. The Highway Administration has also organized railway and highway joint transportation to facilitate people returning to their hometowns. Purchase tickets are issued for the line from Chongqing, Baoji, Xi'an, Yuncheng, Luoyang, Xuzhou to Nanjing, which can be purchased with priority. It costs about 70,000 yuan per person to reach Nanjing. Business offices have been set up at the Lianglukou Social Service Center and Qingnian Road, and passengers' luggage is transported across the river on behalf of customers. However, there are not enough vehicles. It is planned to allocate vehicles from the Lend-Lease Act in India, but this has not been implemented because the British side needs to extract 60% of the transit fee. As for water transportation, the military and civilian transportation in January for the Chongqing-Taiwan, Yichang-Hankou, and Hankou-Nanjing sections totaled 15,674 people and 261,720 tons of goods, which exceeded the budget. In terms of air transportation, the total amount of transportation in the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin area last month was 38,649 people, and the total amount of goods, luggage, and mail was 42,973,727 kilograms, or 6,261,7120 tons. It is estimated that the amount of transportation this month will be higher than last month.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Commodities to be Inspected Regularly</h3>
<p>Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai to re-establish the bureau after receiving orders. After preparations have been completed, the inspection will be implemented on the 21st of this month. For the time being, the inspection will be carried out on export raw silk, tea, beans, plants, oil egg products, casings, pig bristles, feathers, ham, meat, and import and export fruits, vegetables, and artificial fertilizers. According to regulations, all export and import commodities must be inspected and certified by the bureau before they can be declared to customs. All exporters must first register with the Fangchi Bureau before applying for inspection.</p>
<h3>Ten Years of Injustice Suddenly Cleared: Yang Wendao Released from Prison Yesterday, Prisoners in Prison Warmly Welcome Him</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] At 11:40 yesterday morning, when all Shanghai citizens were lining up to go to the racecourse to await the Chairman's address, Yang Wendao was finally safely released from prison, and saw for the first time the new Shanghai with national flags flying all over the city.</p>
<p>Defeating the Japanese Bandits and Seeing the Light Again</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yang Zihan rushed to the High Court on North Zhejiang Road. As soon as the bailiff in charge of the investigation and bail stepped out of the court, he immediately greeted him and took a car to the residence of Yu Zhijing, a Cantonese gentleman who provided bail, to verify that everything was correct. At around 11 o'clock, Tang Huaiqun, Yang's defense lawyer, was already waiting for Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Tilanqiao Prison, to issue the release warrant. Liu happily walked with Tang to the temporary office of the High Court on Airoc Road to sign the warrant. Lawyer Tang then returned to the prison. At that time, more than a hundred prisoners in the "work injury room" were holding a warm farewell for Yang Wendao. Seeing that the release warrant had arrived, they cheered and shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" Some judges and clerks also congratulated Yang. When Yang and others stepped onto the car, a large team of Yizhong workers was marching forward outside the prison. Seeing this scene, Yang and his son were filled with emotion and could not help but shed tears. Yang repeatedly told reporters that if it were not for the Chairman's wise leadership, which finally defeated the Japanese bandits, he would have been unjustly sunk to the bottom of the sea, and would not have had the opportunity to see the light again today.</p>
<p>Family Reunion, Scheduled Broadcasting</p>
<p>At noon, Yang and others went to Room 209 of the Yangzi Hotel, which had been prepared in advance, to rest, have a haircut and shower, and change into brand new navy blue suits. At that time, news reporters and Yang's old friends came one after another. When Yang's 15-year-old son, Handa, met Yang, Yang could hardly recognize him. His heart was filled with sadness, and he was speechless with tears in his eyes. In the afternoon, Yang went to Hongmiao to burn incense, and then returned to his home on Annam Road to meet his wife. The family, who had been separated for ten years, finally reunited.</p>

Yang Wendao himself will also broadcast on the radio station to thank all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply in This City Is No Longer a Problem</h3>
<p>According to the fuel management authorities, the fuel supply situation in this city has been very good recently, and the seriousness of the situation that formed during the war has gradually been resolved. The Fuel Committee regularly charters ten coal transportation ships to travel between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao to transport coal to Shanghai. According to the announcement, the amount of coal shipped to Shanghai last month reached more than 90,000 tons, and it is hoped that there will be a slight increase this month. It is also planned that from March, in addition to the existing consumption, there will be 100,000 tons of stock for preparation. Judging from the current number of sources, the fuel coal needed for all transportation, public utilities, and state-owned enterprises is sufficient to meet their needs.</p>

<h3>Frenzied Speculation: Gold at 1,610,000, US Dollars at 2,220</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the suspension of gold sales by the Chongqing Central Bank and pending instructions from the Ministry of Finance, public sentiment was further agitated. Speculators believed that the authorities' policies were undergoing fundamental changes. Idle funds flocked to gold, and the securities firms used almost all of their available capital, disregarding the threat of high unofficial interest rates of over 20%, and made a desperate gamble. Midday trading was remarkably brisk, reaching a new high price of 1,610,000, before gradually declining. The opening price in the morning jumped wildly to 1,590,000 amidst chaos. Later, pressured by profit-taking from the bulls, it lingered around 1,540,000 for a long time. Then, a major player suddenly made a vigorous short-covering of US dollars, causing the US dollar exchange rate to skyrocket from 2,150 yuan to 2,220 yuan (this price probably did not occur outside the securities building), which greatly stimulated the gold price, causing it to surge again to around 1,610,000. Banks sold off at high prices, and money changers also released large quantities of US dollars. The industry suspended overnight transactions. At noon, the floating long positions were unable to withstand the pressure, and the price broke through the 1,500,000 level, falling to 1,450,000 before stabilizing slightly. The noon closing price was 1,500,500, an increase of 110,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, most firms suspended trading, but there were still underground transactions for overnight delivery, ranging from a low of 1,470,000 to 1,530,500. Finally, it still hovered outside the 1,500,000 level. There were rumors that the Chongqing listed price had been changed to 125,000, causing slight anxiety. Gold ornaments were listed at 160,000, silver at 1,600, and silver dollars at 900 yuan. Unofficial interest rates ranged from 15% to 22%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars initially rose to over 2,000 yuan. Buyers came in droves. The gold market skyrocketed, and the arbitrage spread widened to over 730 yuan. The arbitrage activity of the yarn and cloth firms remained strong. The price gradually increased. Later, large players squeezed the shorts, causing the price to soar to 2,220 yuan. Money changers seized the opportunity to sell off aggressively. In the afternoon, the price struggled around 2,080 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 160 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollar continued to be strong, but it was difficult for the new currency to stand firm at the 100 yuan level. As a result, the old currency increased by 30 yuan again, and the new currency increased by 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Not Favored, All Down Yesterday</h3>
<p>The government bond market was relatively dull yesterday. Speculative activity focused elsewhere. The market was initially firm but later weakened, obviously influenced by the inconvenience in the Chinese stock market. Supply exceeded demand. Type C bonds fell from 2,100 yuan to 1,800 yuan, fluctuating around 1,850 yuan at noon. As a result, Type A and B bonds each fell by 70 yuan, Type C by 90 yuan, Type D by 100 yuan, and Type E by 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were slightly inconvenient due to external interference. Credit was extremely tight. Speculation inclined toward gold, and many people sold stocks to buy gold. Yong Yarn fell from around 2,650 yuan, Meiya from 2,080 yuan, and Jingfu from 145 yuan. The noon closing prices were all low. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Yong Yarn fell by 330 yuan, Meiya by 430 yuan, and the three small popular stocks, including Jingfu, fell by 3 to 9 yuan. Unpopular stocks also fell by about 5%. After the close, floating long positions were forced to sell due to tight credit. Bidding prices were further reduced.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially brisk due to the boost from the gold market. Yisha reached 6,500 yuan, Jardine Matheson 16,500 yuan, Yeguang 3,000 yuan, British American Tobacco 8,900 yuan, Yip Beer 2,300 yuan, and Asia 1,800 yuan before supply appeared. However, as securities firms were squeezed by tight credit, selling pressure gradually increased near noon. At the same time, the gold market also declined. The noon closing prices were all low, showing a slight decline compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Soars, Cloth Follows</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly soared. At the opening in the morning, prices rose in unison. 20-count Blue Phoenix was bid up to a new high price of 1,000,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix once reached 2,020,000, but then retreated by 60,000-70,000 due to fewer buyers. 20-count was at 940,000, and 42-count was at 1,940,000. Other brands such as Shuang Ma and Jincheng also broke through the 1,000,000 level. Overall, the price of fine yarn increased by over 200,000 for the day, and the price of coarse yarn increased by about 50,000 to 100,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton trade became even more active, and the market continued to rise sharply. The Silk Spinning Construction Company purchased a large amount of fine velvet cotton raw materials. The Meimian Midelin brand alone accounted for as many as 800-900 pieces, all of which were raw materials for 42-count and 32-count fine velvet. In addition, there was also considerable demand for domestic cotton raw materials. Therefore, the prices of all types of cotton increased uniformly by another 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As the gold market rose in a straight line, the cloth market also shone brightly. Only small-scale traders decorated the market throughout the day. The increase was not as intense as in the yarn market. A few dyeing and weaving factories sold off futures for the next month to suppress prices. The average price in each market increased by about 2,000-3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Jsaar M. Singer, an American President Lines ship, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying over 34,850 pieces of cotton from the United States, and was docked at the Yangjiadu Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Food Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>The rice market continued to rise sharply due to the continuous increase in gold prices, which stimulated public sentiment. Both japonica and indica rice increased by over 1,000 yuan. Soybeans also increased by over 1,000 yuan. The oil market saw another surge of 3,000-4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes also followed, increasing by 200-300 yuan. Flour continued to increase by 300-400 yuan. Wheat bran increased by 100 yuan. However, raw peanuts remained stable. Cottonseed cakes were in high demand as fuel, and the price increased by 500-600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Managed Products all Rise in Price, Artificial Silk Trade Sparse</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market yesterday saw 120-count Tianqiao spot goods traded at 2,150,000 yuan in the morning. Warehouse receipts followed, traded at 1,380,000 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and prices declined in the afternoon. Spot goods were quoted at 2,100,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Warehouse receipts were at 1,080,000 yuan, with slight transactions. Factory managed products all rose by about 10%. High-grade five-tan goods were traded at 2,450,000 yuan. Silk goods Meiya quilt covers were 100,000 yuan higher per hundred than the previous day. Hongkang Dacheng Gebei crepe prices were stable, increasing by over 100 yuan per yard. Minsheng brocade was traded at 15,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Prices Soar</h3>
<p>After the red opening for asphalt, quotations from various producing areas all trended upwards. Prices in the Lanjin area had already increased to 36,000 yuan. A Hangzhou firm offered to sell Kaipujiang sharp goods for 41,000 yuan three days ago, and it was reported that the price had increased again to 43,000 yuan yesterday. Jiaxing Benche was still only 48,000 yuan the day before yesterday, but had already opened at 50,000 yuan yesterday. All were for delivery in Jiaxing Xiashi. However, freight rates were 20-30% higher than in January, so costs were even higher. Current merchants sell Benche asphalt for 58,000 yuan, Neiping for 54,000 yuan, Daganlan oil for 47,000-48,000 yuan, and Mixinchuan accounts for 1,500,000.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Advance All the Way</h3>
<p>The varieties of red and green tea have seen continuous actual sales recently. Suzhou firms are showing a tendency to accept all offers. Tianjin firms also plan to make a comeback in the coming days. However, market inventories remain thin. Therefore, holders of goods all believe that they are rare and valuable. As a result, the trend has been unusually sharp in recent days. Jasmine Ding Shuangxun has already broken through the 350,000 yuan level per dan. Top-grade Huihong Qing has also reached a new high price. Other varieties have not looked back. As for chrysanthemum, Guang firms are paying even closer attention.</p>
<h3>Seized Cloth Already Being Disposed Of</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth manufacturers still have over 2 million bolts of cotton cloth that were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets, which were transferred by the puppet merchants' association to the enemy and puppet property disposal bureau. The three trade associations of the dyeing and weaving industry, the yarn industry, and the cotton cloth industry have repeatedly applied to various responsible agencies for the return of these goods. It is said that a written request was also submitted to Chairman Chiang during his recent visit to Shanghai. However, according to information revealed by relevant parties yesterday, the Ministry of Military Administration urgently needs to requisition 1.6 million bolts of cotton cloth. The Enemy Property Bureau will coordinate with the customs to take delivery of 600,000 bolts and plans to allocate 1 million bolts from the cloth shipped from the United States. It is said that the 600,000 bolts are the seized goods transferred by the puppet merchants' association. However, their types are all patterned goods, which may not be suitable for the Ministry of Military Administration. According to news from the above-mentioned three trade associations, President Song had previously indicated that he could resolve this matter in accordance with the law. Members are requesting the associations to seek effective relief from higher-level agencies and judicial authorities within the scope of the law as soon as possible. They hope that the government will handle this matter seriously. If the Ministry of Military Administration needs cloth, it can settle the price with the original owners and should not combine it with enemy property for requisition, causing misunderstandings among merchants and the public.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Chongqing] During the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education moved inland, and inland education developed considerably under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, in response to the needs of the times.

<h3>Tung Wah's Subsidiary Team Fails in Match Against British Navy, Losing 2-1 After Initially Leading</h3>
<p>Tung Wah organized a friendly match with the British Navy yesterday for the purpose of training its troops and giving its new players an opportunity to play. Therefore, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, and others were present as spectators and did not participate in the match. The weather was very good yesterday, so the stadium was very lively even though it was a friendly match. Unfortunately, Tung Wah was unable to use its best lineup, which disappointed many fans who like to see the team win.</p>
<p>After the match started, the British team was new and their coordination was not yet skilled. Tung Wah worked hard, and Han Longhai opened the scoring, ending the first half at 1-0. In the second half, the British team's stamina was formidable. Tung Wah's defense was in trouble, and Lin Wenhu committed a major mistake by committing a handball. McClowden scored on the penalty, tying the game at 1-1. The British team took advantage of the momentum, and Towns achieved success, taking the lead at 2-1. Although Tung Wah had many attacks afterwards, they were unable to break through the opponent's net. Tung Wah lost to the British Navy 2-1 at the end of the match.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Basketball League Matches</h3>
<p>There will be three basketball league matches tonight. In the first division, China South will face the Shantou team. In past meetings between the two teams, each has won. Their strategies are similar, so it is impossible to make a prediction before the match. It will depend on the situation at the time. In the women's division, Xuehong and Qinglian are both new and young players. The winner of today's match will avoid last place. Both teams are very young and their strength is about the same, so it will be a close match. In the second division, the Red team will face the V team. The former has just defeated Siling and is carrying its momentum. It is feared that the V team will not be able to escape defeat. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Xuehong vs. Qinglian (Women's) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Red Team vs. V Team (Second Division) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>China South vs. Shantou Team (First Division) 7:15 PM</p>

<h3>Rambling Thoughts on Great Works and the Lives of Writers</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>"Why hasn't China produced any great works yet?" As far as I know, this question was seriously raised and discussed long before the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has been repeatedly mentioned in the rear areas. Now that the War of Resistance has finally been won, this question may soon be raised again and hotly debated.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we acknowledge that literary works are a reflection of objective reality, then China should have, and very likely could have, produced great works long ago.</p>
<p>However, it seems that none have ever been produced. The fact that this question is still being raised and may continue to be discussed is the best counter-evidence. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Naturally, there may be many reasons, such as the relatively short history of China's new literary movement, writers' experiences being too narrow, and the general lack of necessary skills in expression, and even the frequent constraints imposed by certain objective conditions... etc. But the real-life environment of the writers is obviously also closely related.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>We know that writing articles (engaging in literary creation), although certainly not as difficult as moving mountains and filling seas, cannot be considered as easy as sipping tea and drinking wine. Even if you have extraordinary talent, rich experience, and excellent subject matter... if you don't have relatively ample time to conceive and edit, if you don't have a relatively quiet environment (even a small, cramped room will do), if you don't have relatively full energy to allow you to constantly revise and polish... then not only will great works absolutely not be produced, but even things that are not "great," or even "small," will likely be stillborn.</p>
<p>But what is the living environment of the average Chinese writer like? Everyone is complaining about poverty, and many are ill! Writers and poverty are simply like a pair of passionate newlyweds, truly inseparable! In fact, the number of "professional writers" who can completely support themselves by writing is simply one or two out of ten (and their poor and miserable circumstances are beyond the imagination of outsiders!). The rest are all "amateur writers," who are painfully forced to spend most of their best time and energy in offices, classrooms, or even factories and shops to ensure that themselves and their wives and children barely escape starvation and freezing. Only then can they rack their brains, steal moments of leisure, or, after dealing with routine matters, or when utterly exhausted, force themselves to pick up their pens and write... It was like this before the war, and it's even more so after the war! Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it's hard to say what the future holds, but at least at present, there hasn't been the slightest improvement. Moreover, generally speaking, things are inevitably even worse! This is an ironclad fact that is visible to all and heard by all! There is absolutely no fabrication or rumor-mongering!</p>
<p>In this situation, honestly, as long as they don't become another Ye Zi, Wang Luyan, Xie Liuyi, Xiao Hong, second, third, fourth... it would already be an exceptionally rare "miracle," and it could even be said to be "lucky," so how can we talk about "great works"!</p>
<p>Therefore, to this day, the question, "Why hasn't China produced any great works yet?" is certainly worth raising and discussing. But before raising it, what should be mentioned even more urgently is: "How can we make it possible for Chinese writers to have a living environment in which they can produce great works?"</p>
<p>Moreover, I dare to assert that only after solving this fundamental problem first can we talk about other things and think about other things. Otherwise, no matter how passionately you discuss and study, great works will still be extremely far away from us! Extremely far away! Even farther than the sun is from the Earth!</p>
<p>You sincerely hope that your horse will run fast and well, but you are unwilling to feed it enough grass! Isn't that a little too much? Isn't it?</p>
<h3>The Water of the Wall River</h3>
<p>— Ling Xing</p>
<p>Three out-of-towners who had traveled to Tianjin had three different impressions of the water of the Wall River when they returned. One said: The water of the Wall River is dark, black, and foul-smelling, making people cover their noses as they pass by. Another said: The water of the Wall River is like a pool of mud, and only mud masons have a good feeling about it. The third said: The water of the Wall River is incomparably clear, and the fish swimming inside can be counted. I have a common impression of these three people: they did not recognize the Wall River.</p>
<p>As for myself, after traveling to and from Tianjin more than twenty times over ten years, I finally fully recognized the Wall River.</p>
<p>The first time, I strolled across that yellow dirt road from Nankai Girls' High School, and I saw a bend of stream water. Someone told me: This is the Wall River. From that day on, I fell in love with it, I fell in love with the willows on the muddy banks, I fell in love with the clear river water, the fish in the river, and the yachts floating on the water, and even the setting sun slowly climbing over from a distance. When the setting sun climbed over, the river water rippled with reddish-golden waves, and many, many kinds of bright colors shimmered there. Therefore, every evening after dinner, I was accustomed to strolling along the Wall River at dusk. If I had one or two friends, I would rent a yacht, float to Balitai, and bring back the scales of the setting sun on the river surface. But at that time, I was still a child. Only later did I feel pity for the memories. After the war, that place was a long stretch of rubble, with guard posts for enemy soldiers, no longer a place for sightseeing. To seek dreams there, it would be better to seek them in dreams.</p>
<p>However, there was an opportunity to see another side of the Wall River's water. Because the war had made the concessions in Tianjin even more prosperous, it felt like this: if you were to go to Tianjin, you must go to the concessions in Tianjin. The British concession had two most famous roads. One was called London Road, which is now renamed Meiling Road. It seems that the three characters "Meiling Road" are more beautiful than "London Road." There was also Wall River Road. Later, other roads were renamed several times, and some were renamed so difficult to remember. Wall River Road was only changed to Wall River Road, and there were no more changes. The first time, it was in summer, I passed through Yaohua Bridge, and I saw the Wall River water here, just as mentioned above: so dark that it was like ink, and a strong stench rose to the bridge surface. But on the embankment, there were chrysanthemums, locust trees, and a path paved with pebbles, a pile of earth, and a small pavilion. Later, I found that even at night, people still brought palm-leaf fans and enjoyed the cool breeze by the river. Because Xuan and I had strolled along this river, I had no aversion to this dark, black river water. It often brought me back general, beautiful memories and thoughts of unrequited love.</p>
<p>As for the yellow mud-like Wall River water, one had to have a considerable opportunity to see it. One had to take a ship leaving Tianjin at the confluence with the Hai River, and someone pointed to the surging yellow water and said: "Look, that is also the Wall River!" One must have such a person to point it out, otherwise one would not recognize it, because it has completely changed, no longer so gentle, without chrysanthemums, willows, earth mounds, and thatched pavilions. The river water is surging, and it can no longer set off the secluded charm of the setting sun, not to mention that this is on a ship, and the general sorrow of parting often disturbs the poet so that he no longer has poetic ideas, and the traveler's sorrow is all entrusted to the distant journey.</p>
<p>A person skilled in embellishing words will surely decorate the water of the Wall River beautifully and lovably. Because this is a changeable river, only because it is small is it lovable, only because it is changeable can one choose according to one's preferences. If there is a beautiful and gentle memory, the Wall River will be personified and never forgotten.</p>
<p>It is unreliable to boast about the Wall River with words, but do not look at it with worldly eyes. A Tianjin friend boasted to me about their Wall River, saying: "The Wall River is good, the road next to it is so wide and so flat, there is nothing else like it!" Right, he is so right, but can you not have a feeling of laughing and crying? His Wall River is the asphalt road beside that pool of stinking water, and if we are talking about the water of the Wall River here, there is no water in his river.</p>
<h3>Flying Together (14)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>In this day and age, one can't take things too seriously, just live one day at a time. Enjoy the wine today if you have it, smoke the cigarette today if you have it!</p>
<p>Master Weng is indeed like that. From a good perspective, he is very optimistic. From a bad perspective, he is not as ambitious as Master Mo. Although Master Mo is still compromising and prolonging his life, he is ultimately unwilling in his heart. A person who has complaints is a person who has ambition. Master Weng never complains. He is very content with his fate, so he has fewer worries.</p>
<p>While they were talking animatedly, Madam Weng the Second came in. As soon as she entered the door, she shouted:</p>
<p>"What are you two brothers talking about? You're drinking and chatting, really enjoying yourselves!" After saying that, she snatched the pipe from Master Weng's hand and scolded him harshly: "Smoke fiend!"</p>
<p>Master Mo smiled, stood up, and offered Madam Weng the Second a seat.</p>
<p>"I'm happy today, so I specially invited my old brother to drink celebratory wine. How about it? Why don't you have a drink too?"</p>
<p>"No! No! I can't drink," Madam Weng the Second said coyly, plopping down next to Master Weng.</p>
<p>"Brother, in a few months, I will also invite you to drink celebratory wine!"</p>
<p>"Is that so? Your wife is already--" Master Mo said halfway, then felt embarrassed, so he stopped quickly.</p>
<p>"Don't listen to this smoke fiend's words, Brother!" Madam Weng the Second pinched Master Weng quietly, both angry and shy.</p>
<p>"Ouch!" Master Weng couldn't help but shout. Still smiling, he said: "Brother is not an outsider, what's there to be shy about! Maybe if she gives birth to a son tomorrow, we'll have to become relatives! Brother, they're doing a 'marriage pact from the womb,' do you approve?"</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter Appeals to Society to Pay Attention: Is This the Life of an Apprentice?</h3>
<p>Hope the Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Actual Situation and Find Ways to Improve It</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, especially for the oppressed. I am deeply admiring. I was originally an apprentice in a shop, living a life like a slave. In addition to doing all the chores, I also had to cook and take care of the boss's young child, and even wash clothes. A little carelessness would lead to harsh scolding. The day before yesterday, I accidentally broke a bowl while washing dishes, and he happened to see it. Not only was I beaten and scolded, but I had to pay for it, and even my apprenticeship was suspended. Therefore, I had no choice but to pack up my bedding, thinking that if I went home, I would be blamed and looked down upon by my uncle and aunt (because I am an orphan), and mocked by the neighbors. The more I thought about it, the more bitter I felt, and tears fell like rain. But the heartless boss was not sympathetic. I think there is no apprentice in the world who is more miserable than me! Apprentices have no right to speak, let alone read books and newspapers. Because I like to read books the most, I am often beaten, just like Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars. You think that the existence of this apprenticeship system only increases all kinds of inequalities in society, so what democracy and equality can the country talk about? I believe that there are many apprentices in society who are oppressed, and they are looking forward to liberation. I hope the government will thoroughly investigate the living conditions of apprentices. Should it exist and be improved? Today, I boldly address the most tragic appeal to people from all walks of life, and earnestly request the government authorities to lend a helping hand to improve the lives of us apprentices.
