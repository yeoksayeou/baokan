<h3>蔣主席由筑返抵渝　對貴州鴉片已禁絕表示快慰</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕重慶訊：蔣主席將於廿五日左右來京。現國府主席辦公室及主席官邸已布置就緒。聞主席於本月初曾面諭國府總務處長陳希曾，囑善體物資艱難，對官邸布置祇須整潔，凡窗帘桌布須購紗布，禁用舶來絲絨及高貴綢緞。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十二日電〕蔣主席十二日午後四時，由筑乘專機返抵重慶。</p>
<p>〔中央社貴陽十二日電〕蔣主席十二日晨六時廿分參觀筑市特有之復興操，此項晨操係楊兼市長所規定，每戶一人，利用淸晨馬路閑空時閒，分段集中操演廿分鐘，主席巡視時，對之甚感興趣，十時假建業堂茶會招待黔垣紳耆及各界領袖，機關首長，到二百餘人，蔣主席致詞，略謂：久不與諸位相見，今抗戰已獲勝利，還都在即，黔省對抗戰貢獻甚大，故抽暇來黔與諸父老人民一晤，此最快活者，爲貴州鴉片已禁絕，人民身體能與他省一樣，與十一年前之情形大不相同，眞堪快慰。貴州需要交通，現黔省鐵路決由中央祖任修建。此外，將有三事望全省父老人民努力以赴：（一）發展民衆衛生，以增强人民體格。（二）造林植樹，　謂十年樹木，百年樹人，望一年後再來時，能見各荒山均成森林。（三）提高文化，尤其要提高苗胞之文化，演說歷時十八分鐘，耆老婦女工人代表三人亦有意見發表，至十一時卅五分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社貴陽十一日電〕蔣委員長十一日上午九時至麥家橋檢閱靑年軍第二〇五師，並親致訓詞，首謂：各位靑年子弟自去年一月嚮應本委員長之號召，集中於國民革命軍旗幟之下，接受現代的軍訓以來，迄今一年又四月，此一年又四月之中，本委員長對谷脊年子弟，時刻不忘，故於還都之前，特來貴陽檢閱，趁此機會，吿訴各位今後責任及努力方向。繼謂：靑年遠徵軍的責任，在實行三民主義，完成國民革命，建設我們中國，使成爲一個自由平等獨立的現代國家。本委員長今日來到貴州，即要將這個重大的責任交付於各位靑年的肩上，今後革命的成敗，國家的存亡，三民主義能否實行，全視我靑年子弟能吾親愛精誠團結一致，服從命令，嚴守紀律以爲斷。本委員長時刻自勉，決不愧爲各位的統帥與父兄，同時亦望我全體官兵認淸自己責任的重大，立定志願，抱定決心，同生死，共患難，人人自勉爲革命的無名英雄，以實行三民主義爲已任，同心一德，努力奮鬥，來完成我們國家的建設，如此才對得起我們的國父，亦才不辜負我們從軍報國的初衷。</p>
<h3>在美商談範圍廣泛　馬歇爾氏啓程返華　助我謀政治經濟穩定</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾將軍作與杜魯門總統會商後宣稱：渠或將於今日離美來華。馬歇爾將軍曾與貝爾納斯及杜魯門總統作歷時半句鐘之會商，馬歇爾謂：彼等商談之範圍甚廣，其中包括聯總輸送物資至中國之問題。</p>
<p>〔又電〕杜魯門總統十一日在招待記者會中稱：馬歇爾將軍即將返華，馬將軍在華府之談話，一俟渠歸返中國後，將予公布。總統答覆某記者之問題時稱：將軍之訪問與會談頗有貢獻。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕據今日自權威方面探悉：馬歇爾將軍已使國務院官方相信美國有以鉅大款項支持中國復興工作之必要，故預料美國將以美金的五億元之借款，貸與中國，主要供恢復運輸系統之用。美國官方相信：中國之團結統一，於促進亞洲之安定局勢，關係重大，美國目前所盡之極大努力，爲理所當然，則以鉅額信用貸款給與中國，以促進其經濟狀况，實屬同樣重要。消息靈通方面認爲上項貸款之決定，表示杜魯門總統，國務卿貝爾納斯及馬歇爾特使，對於中國政府擴大組織已漸成事實一點，感到滿意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾今日再度離美赴華，進行重大任務，助使飽受痛苦之中國獲得政治團結及經濟穩定。就華盛頓所接官方消息觀之，馬氏此次重臨中國，將見經濟與政治大局，較彼四週前離華時更形嚴重。例如：（一）在馬氏指導下組成之執行小組，在關內各地調停內爭，進行順利，但在混亂之東北，工作毫無進展。（二）東北方面政府與中共大軍對於應由何方恢復主權問題，互爭不已。（三）此種軍事局勢，令人不安，更有慘痛之經濟上結果，因各地已施軍事封鎖，尤以災區最受影響。（四）中國各大政黨已經馬氏協助，獲得團結協議者，現又互相責難，甚至蔣主席與周恩來亦已公開指責對方無信義。抑美政府官員對於中國大局，仍抱樂觀，相信一俟直言無隱之馬氏重返任所，事態即將改觀。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十二日電〕此間中國當局現正爲馬歇爾布置住屋。蔣主席曁政府官員均將來京，故日後馬氏之和平斡旋工作，亦將在京進行。</p>
<h3>九一八·七七紀念式　今後決停止舉行　各部要員今起空軍還都</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕重慶訊各部委任以上還都人員三百餘人，定十三日以十二架運輸機編成之空運大隊運京，內有國府行政院財政部要員多人，該空運大隊自明日起，迄月底止，須載運四一千二百餘公務員還都。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕重慶訊在渝之國大會籌備委員會主委邵力子，委員吳鼎員，張道藩等，均定本月廿五日前，聯袂飛京。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十二日電〕中央常會上次例會，曾決議規定九月三日爲勝利紀念日，並決議停止於九月十八日及七月七日舉行紀念儀式。按九月三日係日本簽定降書之日，故國定是日爲勝利紀念日，並於是日致祭忠烈。至抗戰期間舉行之九一八及七七兩紀念日，現抗戰已獲勝利，事實上無此必要，故決定今後不再舉行。又中央常會定十三日舉行在渝末次會議，下次例會，即將移京舉行。</p>
<h3>錢塘江決口　沈鴻烈令搶修</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十二日電〕浙主席沈鴻烈氏，十二日晨偕王曉籟等專車視察海塘至營垣公區海塘處，適値早潮，江水距塘七尺，營字號塘決口數十丈，江水已漫及麥田，海鹽·海寗決口共七處，共一九二〇公尺，頗有潰決之勢，沈氏當諭限三日內趕草整個整理計劃，並於七日十五日秋潮泛濫前全部工程限期完成，聞是項工程費用約須六十萬萬兇，至曉籟氏允返滬呼籲，浙籍中委陳立夫·朱家驊兩氏今日來電，決予力助，沈氏等於下午返抵杭垣。</p>

<h3>軍事三代表仍留平　長春成立防守部</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕軍事三人代表吉倫，秦德純，陳士渠等，十二日仍留平，據鄭介民稱，彼等未飛瀋，係因氣候不佳之故，吉倫將軍對東北局勢甚躊躇，聞已致電馬歇爾，解決東北糾紛，或可「馬到成功」。十二日上午三代表曾聚集交換意見，並召集各該方面主要工作人員有所協商。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十二日電〕現距蘇軍最後撤退之期僅二日，街頭景象益見緊張，共軍已開始向前移動，昨夜飛機塲內守軍已進入陣地，準備應戰。行營內定之長春防守司令陳家珍少將，已將司令部組成。</p>
<h3>蘇州高等法院昨宣判　陳逆公博處死刑　褫奪公權終身並沒收財產</h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州十二日電〕十二日下午四點十三分，陳逆公博靜靜地聽見了「判決死刑，褫奪公權終身，並沒收財產」的宣告，在這暮春三月的蘇州，花花草草都正在欣欣向榮，法庭外松柏上的小島正在啾啾歌唱，陽光是那麼和煦，天氣是那麼溫暖——整個的宇宙正沉醉在「生」的快樂之中，然而，對於陳公博，却祇見一具無情的絞架，一步步向他迫近！</p>
<p>四點鐘正，蘇州高等法院第一法庭裏擠滿了聽衆和各報的記者，突然一陣騷動，門外人山人海的老百姓們讓出了一條路，一輛馬車在警衛森嚴中抵達高院。陳公博來了，他還是穿着開審那一天穿的籃灰色嗶嘰夾袍，手裏拿了一頂黑毡帽，步履從容，走進了第三候審室，法庭裏的人們剛剛坐好，法警高呼一聲「開庭」，大家又緊張起來。首先進來的，是審判長孫鴻霖，接着是首席檢察官韓　，首席推事石美瑜，推事陸家瑞和一位書記官。審判長對法警輕輕說了一句話，法警就走了出去，一回身，陳人博就跟他走了進來，在強烈的水銀燈下，陳公博的表情似乎祗是疲憊，在開審的那天，他的眼睛裏還閃樂着鬥爭的火熖，但今天却自己早已知道什麽都完了。他的手裏還拿着那頂毡帽，黑色的皮鞋燁燁有光——但是，誰知道他再能穿戴幾天！</p>
<p>書記官站起來說：「陳公博漢奸一案，今日宣判」。陳公博抬起了頭，仰面靜靜聽着，他沒有什麼驚慌，但是他不住的　着眼睛，他的嘴唇是緊　的，但是似乎正在嚼什麼東西，他的身體魏然不動——他曾不曾作過「萬一僥倖之想」呢？</p>
<p>審判長的聲音：堅定·懇擊·沉着。他堅定地站着宣讀判決主文。審判長宣讀主文以後，陳公博仍舊是巍然不動，但他似乎在咽什麼，喉結那麼一上一下的，動得利害。一位穿得很漂亮的女記者跑過來替他照一張相，陳公博似乎沒有看見，眞能視死如歸麼？還是「愍不畏法」呢？（圖爲聆聽宣判後之陳逆公博神色。）</p>
<h3>陳逆對判決　謂不再聲辯</h3>
<p>審判長面若冰霜，朗朗唸着判決理由：至於被吿之抗辯，無非企圖减輕罪責，不足採取，被吿昧於大義，甘作罪魁，特處極刑，以昭烱戒。審判長接着就和藹地對他說：「判決書就可以送到，依照特種刑事案件施行條例，本案無論被吿不服與吾，均應送最高法院覆判，故送請覆判爲本院之職責，如有申辯，仍可提出，但如有申辯狀則頂好快一點，在十天之內送到。」</p>
<p>陳公博側耳靜聽，仍舊很鎭定，他說：「上次審判的時候，我已經說過決不聲辯了。」但孫審判長就告訴他，這是於法不足為據的。</p>
<p>陳公博說：「荷蒙庭上允許，本人的聲辯書和自白書，都蒙歡迎予發表，本人心事已了。本人很諒解檢察官的地位，他是不得不然的，且次檢察官的話，也已經有過了表示，本人在政治上是失敗了，人格上是沒有失敗的。」</p>
<p>他微笑着向庭上鞠了一個躬，法警把他擁了出去，時間是四點二十一分。</p>
<p>有一位旁聽的小姐，在贊美陳公約頭髮梳得漂亮，但是我却想起了舊時槍斃強盜，強盜常常高呼着說：「二十年後又是　條好漢！」於是采聲雷動，陳公博這個人一生最大的毛病就是拚命要博得一聲喝采，以致心勞　絀，明知道是死路，也要走一走再說，他已經極「表演」這能事了，會不會過幾天再寫一首「被判死刑有感」的歪詩呢</p>
<h3>溥儀即引渡　將解京審訊</h3>
<p>鄭逆財產清查中</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日急電〕政訊：蘇聯已接受我引渡偽滿執政溥儀之要求，引渡期約在本月廿日後，屆時我政府將派專機一架飛瀋陽守提。聞溥儀財產大部已成「勝利品」，偽滿執政府之重要文件，已不在東北，溥儀引渡後，決解交首都高等法院審訊，前僞滿內閣總理鄭逆孝胥在東北及平津之遺產，現正在清查中。</p>

<p>事實</p>
<p>陳公博原係中國國民黨黨員，為汪逆兆銘之心腹，迭在中樞充任要職。民國廿六年，中日戰事發生，敵勢披猖，淞滬旋告不守，震撼首都。國民政府決定長期抗戰，西遷重慶，策劃反攻。詎汪逆兆銘竟違反旣定國策，甘受日　近衛文　之利用，秘密言和，陳公博追隨汪逆，參與謀議，於廿七年底，應汪逆之召，自成都潛往越南河內，續商和平運動。自汪逆草擬主和　電，交陳公博周佛海等携至香港發表，以響應近衛主張之和平三原則，冀圖淆惑聽聞，阻撓中央抗戰計劃。旋汪逆轉赴上海，與日寇商訂和平基礎方案，樹立偽政權。而陳公博則奔走於港滬之間，始終參與其事。迨磋商已獲妥協，即於廿九年三月卅日，共同組織僞國民政府於南京。汪逆自任僞主席，陳公博則任僞立法院院長，並於同年五月，以偽專使名義，率領使節團赴日答禮，嗣又兼任僞上海市市長。於日寇卵翼之下，公然僭用職銜，背叛中央。同年十一月卅日，在南京正式簽訂中日基本關係條約，同時發表中日滿共同宣言，承認滿洲國，以破壞我國領土之完整。又於太平洋戰事爆發後，附和日寇，於卅二年一月九日，以偽國民政府名義，對我盟邦英美宣戰，並與日寇締結同盟條約。嗣復以僞大使名義，東渡訪日。翌年三月，汪逆赴日就醫，陳公博代行僞國民政府主席及僞軍事委員會委員長職務。從此僞政府軍政大權由其獨覽。至汪逆死後，即正式代理偽主席，兼任僞行政院院長。並以僞元首資格，赴日拜見敵皇，表示仍本汪逆遺志，與日寇同生共死，以完成大東亞戰爭之任務。上年八月，因日寇投降，畏罪潛逃，匿居日本。經國民政府電令拘送回國，轉解本院檢察官偵査起訴。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本案被吿與在逆兆銘共同組織僞國民政府，歷充各重要僞職，並於汪逆死後，繼其首魁地位，總攬偽政權，竊據南京，擅發號令各情，已據自白不諱。並有偽立法院公報內被吿以僞院長名義王持會議及處理院務之記載，偽上海市政公報內被吿以僞市長職銜發布之公文，曁叧案査獲被吿以僞國民政府代理主席任用褚誼爲僞廣東省長僞廣州綏靖主任等職之任命狀，可資證明。該被吿對於汪逆在離渝前，如何吿以與日寇秘密媾和之圖謀，邀其潛赴越南河內，拍發主和　電，以為敵　近衛文　和平聲明之策應。如何經汪逆召赴上海，與日寇商訂基本關係條約。又於僞政府成立後，以偽專使名義赴日答禮，旋發表中日兩共同宣言，公然承認江洲國。以及如何於太平洋戰事發生後，以僞國民政府名義，對英美宣戰，並簽訂中日同盟條約。一再東渡，拜見敵酋，聲明誓與同生共死各事實。其自白書及在本院供述，亦皆言之歷歷。參以僞宣傳部編印之「僞國民政府使節團赴日答禮記」「陳公博赴日答禮言論集」「中日締約與大東亞戰爭」政治月判社出版之「偽國民政府政綱之理論與實施」等書，及「偽上海市政公報」「國外新聞貼報簿」各册之記載，均屬相符。則被吿與汪逆共同勾結日寇，秘密言和，樹立僞政權，公然背叛中央，逆跡至為昭著。自應成立懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國之罪。至被吿抗辯理由，的分五點。（一）謂：「黨不可分，國必統一，故對汪逆離渝及組織偽政府，均不贊成，屢經勸阻無效，一祗以關係過深，未忍遽然離去」。（二）謂：「對於中日基本關係條約，始終表示反對，經一再要求，已獲廢止，並曾向日寇交涉取消滿洲國」。（三）謂：「與日寇言和，係求全面和平之實現，故對於重慶政府，從無敵對行爲，至僞政府雖對英美宣戰，但未實行出兵。其目的僅在避免日寇搜括物資」。（四）謂：「淪陷區人民創鉅　深，經僞政府予以搶救，國家元氣賴以保存不少」。（五）謂：「日寇投降後，曾維持南京治安，以待國軍接收，嗣後赴日待命，並非潛逃」。各等語。（下接第二版）</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐的十一日電〕聯合國代表二餘人，刻正在紐約中區某旅館最上層廂房內靜寂環境中，草擬國際軍編制計劃，此項國際軍隊將成爲世界最强大之兵力，用以姐止或於必要時擊滅侵略。據聯合國憲法規定：國際軍責任係在忠吿及協助聯合國機構安全理事會，應付維持世界和平與安全，而需用武力時所發生之各項問題，並協助安全理事會處理軍隊之調用及指揮，軍備之調整及裁減各項問題。此項國際軍為執行安全理事會之決議，如以爲利用斷絕外交及經濟關係或斷絕交通等手段仍吿無效時，可有全權使用武力，參謀委員會將來權力之大，由此可知。安全理事會爲執行其決議，可使用示威，封鎖，或出動聯合國陸海空軍。參謀委員會係由中·美·英·蘇·法·五强參謀長充任常任委員，其他與會代表均係各該國陸海空軍高級顧問。所當討論者係五十一會員國究將以幾許軍隊及配備，供作國際軍隊之用。觀察家咸信空軍及海軍大部將由美國供給，陸軍則以蘇聯佔最多數。該委員會刻正邀照安全理事會之令，根據軍事觀點，對聯合國憲章第四十三條加以檢討。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>西班牙與聯合國</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會在紐約召開以來，首光即遭遇伊朗問題的雖關，現在又因西班牙問題將引起紛歧的意見，眞所謂一波未平，一波又起。蘇聯代表初謂蘇聯已在伊朗開始撤兵，兩國間又復成立協議，但伊朗代表却否認蘇聯方面的行徑，不時未向聯合國撤回其中訴，抑且堅持其立塲。英美代表爲維持國際法起及小國　　，同時　　固聯合國機構的權力，曾予伊朗以支持，　蘇聯代表在會議席次上有請　的演出，終之蘇聯代表憤然退席。安全理事會為應府　　局勢，乃予以　期討論；正於其際，伊朗局勢　　有　　展，　　日趨明朗。聯合國安全理事會之處　伊朗問題，也因此　不世人為所注意。可是當伊朗問題的驟風急雨　　之議，另一問題　　出現在聯合國安全理事會前面，這　是關於西班牙局勢的問題。</p>
<p>據聯合國紐約十日電：波蘭代表　琪今日　　聯合國機構秘書長　依，請安全理事會對西班牙　　朗哥政府採行動，其理由為西班牙已威脅世界和平，並爲國　黨及其資產之捕逃蔽，德國科學家正在計劃戰爭新方法。叧據合衆社紐約十日電，則謂波蘭向聯合國機構要求對西班牙弗朗哥政府採取行動，並指控在西班牙隱　之　科學家，可能在西國之卵　下從事原子炸彈及火箭彈之硏究工作，足以危害國際和平安全。本報據土一日紐約廣播稱：此　官方宣布，波蘭請求聯合國安全理事會將西班牙間題列入議程，美國表示予以支援，但或將繼續反對安全鉀事會對弗朗哥採取行動云云。可知西班牙問題，旣由波蘭提出，聯合國勢必予以討論。至於將來採取何稱步驟以及對於西班牙問題在聯合國機構將如何演化，此時無待臆測；不過西班牙問題之被提出於本屆的安全理事會，却有幾點可以注意：</p>
<p>第一，關於西班牙問題是由波蘭向安全理事會提出的，而波蘭在實際上已不啻為蘇聯的附席。波蘭之向安全理事會提出西班牙問題，若非直接受蘇聯的指使，亦必得蘇聯的支援。此項問題之彼提出，正當聯合國處理伊朗問題之後；而在處理伊朗問題時，英美態度的堅決竹使蘇聯代表感到窘困。今伊朗問題旣見明朗，而我們適又看見有西班牙問題的被提出，或意在使英美陷於如從前蘇聯所處之窘困地位。原來對於西班牙間題，自英美指斥弗朗哥後迄未有何行動、波蘭之在聯合國機構提出西班牙間題，乃在迫使聯合國對弗朗哥採取行動。然英美及其它各國對於西班牙問迎的看法，宋必同於蘇聯和波蘭。自從西班牙的「人民軍隊」爲弗朗哥摧毁，西班牙政局轉趨穩固以來，若干國家即圖以國際壓力來摧毁弗朗哥的政權。但英美等國對於弗朗哥政權，雖絕無同情，而哥法却有不同，據合衆社華盛頓十一日電，法國政府所提對弗朗哥政府實行經濟制裁之建議，已遭美國之拒絕，其拒絕之理由，大約因美國人士相信，對弗朗哥實施經濟制裁，適足以鞏固其國內之地位。所以這一西班牙問題的被提出，其意義多少與伊朗問題之被提出於安全理事會一樣，不過英美與蘇聯間所處之地位却有不同，由主動而爲防禦，由或防禦而爲主動。</p>
<p>第二，西班牙問題與伊朗問題的意義不同。前者爲一個內政問題，而後者是一個國際問題，牽涉到條約關係，以及駐軍問題。弗朋哥政權是否爲西班牙人民所擁戴，依據大西洋憲章的精神，應由西班牙人民自身決定。特別是我們中國人民，對於弗朋哥政權的倒行逆施，奉承軸心，承認出現在中國境內的傀儡政權等等，無不切齒痛恨。今軸心崩潰，對於西班牙過去的罪行，理應有所淸算及懲處。但我們却記取對弗朗哥罪行的痛恨是一事，而對於淸算及懲處弗朗哥的罪行却又是一回事。弗朗哥罪行的淸算及懲處，須由西班牙人民自身爲之。如果企圖以外力來摧毁在西班牙目前不失爲一種安定力的弗朗哥政權，不特將招致西班牙人民的反感，轉而使弗朗哥政權趨於鞏固，抑且有干涉內政之嫌。此在將來國際關係間，不應開此惡例</p>
<p>聯合國機構是一個誕生不久的機構，無論它的先天條件如何，將米國際秩序的安危，實繫於聯合國機構的作爲。在聯合國機構的運轉上，事屬草創，缺乏成規；因此，對處理若干國際問題上，也就有了所謂程序問題。不過假如一個是明顯的內政問題。而竟列入議程，縱不採取若何行動，這本身已經近於干沙內政，與大西洋憲章的精神是否相符，値得注意。我們必須記取：世界的安危，就繫於聯合國機構今後的如何運用，故聯合國處理任何一個問題，切不可疏忽大意，走錯一着！</p>
<h3>蘇高法院對陳逆公博之判決書</h3>
<p>（上文接第一版）關於第一點，査在逆勾結日寇，背叛中樞，果如被吿所云，力經勸阻無效，此時即應權衡輕重，以決去就。乃被吿竟應汪逆之召，潛赴河內，代發主和艷電，旋又共同組織偽國民政府於南京，分任要職，在逆旣歿，復繼其職位，而居首魁。並在偽滿成立十三週年紀念日廣播，聲明繼承汪逆遺志，與日滿緊密携手，以期共存共榮。此項廣播演詞，有敵國電機唱片可證。足見被吿去順效逆，徇情昧義，不惜犧牲一切，而爲喪權辱國之舉。其對在逆一人，雖已盡其忠忱，而於國家民族，則貽害匪漢。且被吿託庇日寇，竊據東南，固已形成割裂之局。而又組織僞國民黨，召開六全大會，藉資號召，所謂：「黨不可分，國必統一，」顯屬自相矛盾。關於第二點，按中日基本關係條約規定，日本有權在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國領海內，屯駐艦隊，以及實行經濟提携，任日寇侵害主權，搜括物資。即被吿亦自知爲不平等之苛約。乃竟附和汪逆，由其主管之僞立法院予以通過，將使我國受其束縛，永淪爲日寇之附庸。犧牲國家民族，在所不惜。縱使事前表示反對，事後要求廢止，亦不能以此諉卸責任。而况該基本條約雖廢，機又續訂中日同盟條約，與敵國結爲盟邦，關係愈臻密切。致與中央抗戰國策背道而馳，利害更屬相反。又査被吿初則與汪逆發表中日滿共同宣言，嗣又於三十四年二月二十六日，廣播慶祝　滿成立十三週年之紀念。始終承認滿洲國之存在。其影響所及，實足破壞我國領土之完整。茲猶斤斤辯稱：曾向日寇交涉取消滿洲國，其孰能信。關於第三點，査被吿附和汪逆與日寇媾和，旣違反我抗戰國策，且又背叛中樞，叧組僞府，並在偽中央政治會議中，決議：「　府還都後，重慶方面對內對外各種政令及條約協定契的等，一概無效，所有軍隊應即停戰待命，所有公務員應於最近期間來京報到。」此有「偽國民政府政綱之理論與實施」書內之記載可稽。該決議案旣妄稱「國府還都」而又否認重慶政府之存在，其欲消滅中央政權，企圖取而代之，昭然若揭。所謂對重慶政府從無敵對行爲，已不攻自破。又按我國旣定方針，係聯合英美民主陣線，以抵抗德日軸心。乃被吿與汪逆竟樹立僞政權，與敵國日本携手，悍然對我英美盟邦宣戰。其目的在依附軸心，摧毀英美使我中央抗戰陷於孤立，以遂其叛國之企圖，極爲明顯。所謂以此抵制日本搜括物資，亦係掩飾之詞。關於第四點，按日寇對於淪陷區，因無力控制，始製造傀儡政府，供其利用，藉以達其以華制華以戰養戰之目的。被吿與汪逆組織偽政府後，奉承日寇意旨，在淪陷區所施之稗政，如搜括物資，濫發僞幣，公賣鴉片，奴化靑年，淸鄕封鎖等項，殆無一而非禍國殃民之舉。此就本院所調取僞上海市政府文卷及在叧案搜獲被吿與褚民誼來往之電報，可見一斑。以上諸端，均係出自日寇政治侵略之毒計，其貽害之深，足以亡國滅種而有餘。被吿尙謂搶救人民，保存元氣，實屬適得其反。關於第五點。按僞政府旣係傀儡機構，於日寇投降後，即失其憑藉，勢必同時解體。當時日本降將今井岡村在南京息戈候命，於國軍未到達前，對地方秩序，仍應遵照受降命令，負責維持，原無須被吿再予協助。况被吿僅有少數殘餘兵力留駐南京，更屬無足輕重。縱使曾飭部屬與敵軍共維治安，亦係於途窮之中，不得不俯首就範。何能以此冀邀宥恕。再被吿果係誠心待罪，則不問環境如何，亦應在京候命，乃竟急遽避往日本，其非畏罪潛逃而何。綜上種種抗辯，無非飾詞，希圖减免罪責，均屬無可採取。按日寇夙以呑併我國爲其陰謀。自九一八後，盤據我東北四省一成立僞滿帝國。旋又出兵內蒙，進窺平津，演成七七事變。我國忍無可忍，爲求民族之生存，起而抗戰。舉國上下，一致共赴國難，以爭取最後勝利。被吿原爲中樞要員，自應深明斯旨。詎因戰事初期，我軍稍挫，意志遽爲動搖，遂附和汪逆，甘受日寇利用，於情勢逆轉一髮千鈞之際，竟秘密出走，發電主和，繼而組織僞府，背叛中央，並與日寇締結同盟，悍然對我英美盟邦宣戰，一再破壞抗戰國策，助長日寇侵略，將使國家民族陷於萬刧不復之境地。實屬昧於大義，甘作罪魁。於法無可矜全，目應處以極刑，以昭烱戒。全部財產，除酌留家屬必須生活費外，併予沒收</p>
<p>據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條，第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條，黨員犯罪加重處刑暫行法第一條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第二十八條，第六十四條第一項，第六十五條第一項，第五十七條，第三十七條第一項，判決如主文。本案經本院檢察官韓燾蒞庭執行職務。中華民國三十五年四月十二日。江蘇高等法院刑事第一庭審判長推事孫鴻霖印·推事石美瑜印·推事陸家瑞印·書記官蔡一亭。</p>

<p>行政院院長宋子文，昨午召見敵產處理局局長劉攻芸，歷時甚久，聞談話內容，與解除各機關曁公務人員居住困難問題有關。據確悉，行政院鑒於勝利以還，後方各機關人員復員來滬，覓屋居住，極端困難，茲値敵僑陸續遺歸，爲實澈敵僞產業，一律出舊之旣定方針，並兼　敵僑居住房屋原業主之權益及解除各機關曁公務人員之居住困難起見，特規定分配上海各一機關房屋辦法如下：</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕電影女明星袁美雲染有阿美蓉癖甚深，昨晨八時許，經市警局常熟路分局行政股，派警前往其寓所將袁傳入分局訊問。據袁供認吸食鴉片已兩年，現仍在吸食中，並未向警局登記。當即移解總局刑事警察處，轉解法院核辦。又訊：關於禁烟連坐一點，根據保甲人員協助禁烟辦法之規定，僅由戶長負本戶烟民連坐之責，倘戶長係烟民，由其本人受法律處分，其家屬不負連坐之責。昨載何副市長之解釋，關於「家勝人等亦須連坐」一點，茲由市府聲明，何氏並米述及，實出誤會。</p>

<h3>提高房　本市房地產商表示　業主方面仍無利潤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以改訂房租事徵詢本市房地產商方面意見，據悉：該方面認爲市府此項措施，暫時尙不脫爲一公允辦法。所加倍數，亦稱確當。如再參照法幣與僞中儲券兌換之比率言之，則其所加倍數，實不能謂小。惟業主方面，對所加倍數仍無法談利潤，至多不過對管理房屋費用，略事挹注而已。此外則關於房捐一項，亦將增加，再加市保衛團服裝費百分之十四，印花稅，與即待開征之租賃所得稅，地捐等等，均須亦所加倍數中扣除，故實得至爲有限。而管理房屋之費用支出殊鉅，即以保險費一項而言，其增漲率已達戰前原數二千倍，殊使業主難於應付云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：租賃所得稅頃已曲立法院擬就稅率草案，刻正徵詢本市市商會律師公會及會計師公會意見中。聞每年房租淨入在一千萬元以上者，將課稅百分之十二。在五千萬元以上者，將課稅百分之十八云。</p>

<h3>中國受災最重　餓莩到處皆是　聯總署長代表摩尼氏視察災情後發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國善後救濟總署署長代表摩尼，於二月下旬奉命來華視察滬·浙·閩·魯靑·冀·熱·平·津·晋·綏·察·湘·鄂·粤·各區視察善後救濟工作，俾向華盛頓總署報吿，日前返滬。昨日上午十一時，在河濱大厦招待記者，由該署中國區署長凱澤陪同答覆問題。摩氏發表談話如次：</p>
<p>中國經八年苦戰，受災最重，數百城市慘遭損毁，數百萬難民淪落他鄕，返里無法。飢寒貧病，慘不忍睹。目前因飢病而死者，數字已相當驚人。聯合國善後救濟總署，已委託中國行政院義後救濟總署，儘速運送糧食及其他物資救濟，惟以交通不便，運輸極爲困難，尤以華中爲甚。在水陸交通無法運輸物質之區域，擬以飛機運輸。　聯總本身所得米麥爲數亦極有限，運中國者已達美金六七五，〇〇·〇〇〇元。中國爲欲救濟其數百萬之飢民，誠然不能全部依賴進口糧食，而在此迫急之際，中國自身仍可設法彌補，即：（一）有一部份區域及中共一部份區域內，糧食尙有過剩，應儘量分配給予。（二）有一部份都市飯館中宴客菜飯館可减少，中上階級家庭平時餐食亦常竭力節省。聯總物資，全在救濟需要救濟者，在中國方面，其項目有兩重，即救濟與建設，而在建設方而所耗費用，較救濟者允大。</p>
<p>本人來華之前，曾聞及有關行政院善後救濟總署之各種批評，故來此曾多方視察。行總過去處事曾有失當之處，但吾等亦屬不免。如每一新機構之成立，行總難免遭受種種困難，但目前工作則已大有進步。二月前，上海碼頭堆有大批物資，未加運輸，今日已大量輸送至內地，歷經十餘處之險狹道路，輾轉運輸，其艱苦可見，本人頗爲滿意。</p>
<p>摩氏又答覆記者詢問，救濟物資已有運輸至共產區者，但交通甚艱，乃先將物資運至北平，然後取道長城等地，自中國中央政府所管轄區最後地點，運至共產區最前地點，其間運輸亦極費週折。</p>
<p>聯總救濟中國糧食已達二十萬噸。最缺乏糧食者爲河南，湖南，廣東，及廣西等諸省。</p>
<p>救濟修復破壞房屋</p>
<p>（又訊）收復區各地房屋破壞情形均極嚴重，尤以湘鄂贛豫桂等省爲最。行總方面業已決定原則，首先協助修復破壞在百分之五十以上之城市，惟以公共建築，如醫院，幼誰園，小學，市塲，重要慈善機關爲限，私人修補或重建房屋不擬補助。某通信社十日新聞稿所傳種種，並非事實。</p>

<h3>美鈔步昂貴買戶踴躍　金價連帶上漲　美滙仍有看高傳說</h3>
<p>烚赤昨縱續邁進，一部份黃金押款，因銀根鬆濫，頗有歸還，偕金玩股者，勢必抵補空額，買戶遂較踴躍，加之美匯仍有看高傳說，受美鈔之刺激，金市亦被帶上，沈靜已久之金市，至此略見活躍，査晨開平盤，開後續有一部份多方了結，先見一四五萬，但以美鈔步昂，買戶尙殷，缺額者亦陸續補空，以備償還原主，此後形成求過於供，逐步回好至一五六萬，而後始轉徘徊，惟低至一五一萬光景，仍多維持，蓋從美鈔方面加入之套買頭寸，活動不已，午刻在一五三萬五左右盤旋，午後買意不衰，曾漲至一五九萬而後稍見回落，結果較前收續漲八萬，銀樓飾金掛十七萬元，紋銀一千五，銀元一〇三〇元有賣，暗拆銀根仍鬆，息價自一角二分至一角七分不等。</p>

<h3>大戶翻雲覆兩　公債起落無常</h3>
<p>公債昨仍在一般所謂債市大戶賣風包圍中，繼續下游，多方一部份在翻空，統丙晨開四四〇元，曾漲到四八〇〇元光景，遂由大戶領導供給，一時賣氣活動，下落達六百元，最低退至四二〇〇元光景，而後轉盤，午刻在四三〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收再挫二百五十元，其他甲乙丁亦帶小一百元，戊種微降。</p>
<h3>華股頭重脚輕　外股一帆風順</h3>
<p>業廣跳上六成之多</p>
<p>昨日華股除永紗美亞景福三熱而外，其他槪屬有行無市，有賣無買之象，三熱牡丹雖好，缺乏襯托，空方較爲擁擠，中途屢有小規模之軋空，無如冷門及元老各股有跌無漲，永紗雖見五四五〇元，美亞四五〇〇元，景福四七〇元高價，午收仍見回降，結果較前收永紗美亞景福三熱各升半成光景，冷門各股則平穩而已，元老股商務退至九萬元左右，中華四千二有供無求，中興煤礦九萬五，亦屬供給頭寸，各小股亦屬賣盤居多，午後　日預做稍高，永紗五四〇〇元，美亞四四〇〇元，景福四五五元，外股有銀行帮新多加入，掮客帮垂靑業廣，怡紗仍爲大衆投資目標，英聯籌碼奇缺，市價已凌駕怡紗之上，怡紗自晨開一二〇〇元光景，逐步盤高至一二七〇〇元，午刻在一二五〇〇元左右盤旋，午收結果較前收各股均漲一成至一成半左右，祥泰墾植以底價便宜，漲起二成光景，業廣受大戶垂靑，獨跳六成，收後喊價仍見向上，午後先高後低，結果平穩，傳衆業公所午後集會，擬與華股合併營業，證券帮多頭幾全部流入銀行謝新多手中。</p>

<h3>關於寫詩</h3>
<p>— 鳳寸照</p>
<p>市上新行的一本詩刋叫「綿詩島」，內容是全部的詩和詩的論文。對於這刋物裏所有的詩作，這裏暫不作評述，儘覺得在青年人寫詩的方面，有些話要說。</p>
<p>一般的青年對詩，有兩點是需要那重提出的，一種是詩的修　也是文　的修辭，它亦應有一切周全的詞句——比方，要主詞，實詞，動詞，形容說以至介系字所連貫起來的。它不應是用三個以上的連疊的形容詞，而沒有詢詞的那種詞句。</p>
<p>美是詩的條件之一，但它之形成，常在全體的組織完畢之後，如果先去將字面　詞剔一番，面後將一個個花卿為將的字句　搭成功，它一定要成功一塊調色板，光芒刺目，實際是一無所有。</p>
<p>詩雖即不是散文，但先將散文　好，然後作詩，至少可以避免上列的缺陷。</p>
<h3>心理學新書兩種</h3>
<p>— 機同芳</p>
<p>黃翼：兒童心理學（正中）</p>
<p>傅彬然：學習心理之話（開明）</p>
<p>關於心理學的書籍，近年來出得並不算少，但適合一般人閱讀而能有助於生活改進的，却不多見。最近，我看過而本書，一是黃翼的「兒意心理學，」是傅彬然的「學習心理之話」，覺得很適合一般需要。這兩本書雖說不上是學術巨著，然而和我們日常生活的關聯比較密切，所以提出來介紹一下。</p>
<p>「兒童心忽學」著者黃　博士，曾在浙大任教多年，並主持浙大「　帝院」，對兒童心理研究極有心得，聞該書出版後即病孤內地。實在是我國學術界的損失。我讀了黃氏的連本遺　，認為在內容方面巳能概括重要的兒童心理間題，雖只是不到二百頁的小書，但已夠代表現代科學的兒童心理學的概要，可以帮助讀者了解現代兒童心理學的眞正意義，以及在兒童教育上應採取的基本原則，所以說它適合一般需要。</p>
<p>全書分十六章。第一章說明兒童心理學為研究個人行為的發展歷程的科學，更扼要地叙述研究兒童心理學的價值。第二章把兒童心理學之歷史的發展說了一下，使我們知道兒童心理學怎樣進展到近代的科學將究。第三章指示研究兒童心理學的方法。第四章論發展的原則，對遺傅和環境，生長與學習作了極詳盡的討論，並及心理發展的公律和速率，個別差異的情形。第五章從胚胎期，兒童期，青年期各階段心理發展的狀態，指出人類心理發展的一般趨勢。第一章至第五章自成一系統，可以稱為概論。</p>
<p>從第六章起，討倫兒童心理上的重要問題。第六章，兒童的游戲，特別强調遊戲和教育的關係，指示教育上的新觀念。第七章際泛論動作的發展外，並分述胚胎期，初生起，要兒期及幼兒期動作發展的情形，引證新近的實騐研究頗多。從第八章至十四章仍網繪研討兒童各方面的發展——知覺，語言，智，此會行為，情緒，需欲，道德，　各就發展的程序，差別，變詞，　進加以討論，同於各方面的發展上所須訓要和控制也有閱發。第十五章根據心理衛生的原則論述兒童心理健康問題，於精神病和病態性格，兒童的日常行為，以及訓育上順該依據的心理術生原理，都擇要申述。最後一章是兒童訓導問題舉隅，示以兒童教育上的實例，如服從，憤怒與哭吵，懼怕，口吃，用左手的兒童，智　和行為問翮，以及身體的缺陷，都提出有效的補救方法。</p>
<p>兒童心理學的織著方法，通常有兩種：一是純淬科學研究，偏重學理上的討論，目的在了解兒童的行為及其發展的原則，一是將心理學的原則普遍應用兒童的教養問廂，偏重於實際生活的應用，是屬於技術學的。這兩種不同的編著方法，性質完全不同。黃式的書應該是屬於應用的。廣義的兒童心理學，包括自受胎至成年的全程發展，該書因斐適合部頒幼師課程標凖，曹可用作教本，故洋於六七　以前的時期，小學時期也相當注意，青年期則從略。我想，如果把這本書作幼稚師範或師範學校的教本實在再適宜也沒有了。家庭主婦也可從這本書裏得到更多的關於教養兒童的實際加能，</p>
<p>這本書和過去出版的兒童心理學不同的地方，就是實騐統計的材料，引用得不過多，着重的還是原理原則的解釋。原来著者的意思，認為學問的歸宿，不在繁瑣的事實和數碼，而在這些材料的意義原则。為初學者而寫，這態度是對的。還有，這本書的觀點，近於於「形學說」（Gesat　Theory）。學「交替反射」，「悠受」，「聊念」，「反射弧」這些概念，目然不被採入了。先應主清觀念，才可以把握全書的思想。為初學編著兒童心理學，固應避免艱深的理論和學說的爭訟、但一個羣統的觀點總不該沒有，所以著者採了他認為最合事實的發展學說，拿完形學說故思想的中心。</p>
<p>我覺得這本書的長處是要言不煩，觀黯正確。只是還有不少問題，如思想，概念，宇宙觀，續盛，藝術活動等，都不能不受篇幅的限制而摒棄於討論的範圍之外，這點，我認為是一個缺憾、</p>
<p>心理學的知識近年来頗有應用於實際生活中的趨勢。應用心理學的發展，是人類前途的幸福，心理學被應用最廣的當然首推教育的各種活勤，而學習心理學這個名書，又常披人和教育心理學在一起，她實在是敎育心理中最主要的一個部分。普通的敎育心理學多討論到學習心理，至於專門探討心理的書籍，那對於學習心理問題更叙述得很祥盡，什麼學習律，學習的轉移，學習的環境，學習的有效原則部分期逐項加以申述。可是這類書籍一般的缺陷就是偏於理論的羅列，頗少事實的引證，而且寫得很呆板，幾乎使人感到全是機械的條文，和我们的生活（學習活動也是我們的生活之一）好像並不盡生聯　了。</p>
<p>最近開明出版的一學習心理之活，到沒有這種缺陷。這本書的著，傅彬然先生，曾將學習心理上的若干重要問题，針對現實生活的需要、寫成獨立的題目，在「中學生雜誌」上零篇刊載，這書便是這些零篇文章的結集。那些文章因為能够把握學習心理上所要討論的中心問題，刋出後曾擁有内地的大量讀者。這本結集。雖是由各個獨立的題目編成，不若通常學習心理學的分列章節，由緒論而至本論，由一般概念的叙述，至而特殊問題的討論，然而那些單篇文章到是有着無形的聯舉關係的。該書的唯一引人入勝之處，即在不取一般敎科書的叙述方面，以輕　的筆劃和生動的例　，把學習心理上的各種基本原則，應用到現實的學習活動上去、</p>
<p>學習不能和生活分離，又綜合各家對於學習的不同的解釋，要我們把平時學習的實際情形，與這些理論作一番比較和印證。一讀聖賢書所學何事」一篇，籍宋僑的話為引子，說明我們在日常學習中所學到的到底是什麼，從習慣拔能的獲得到知識的學習，再到欣賞和理想的學習，究竟有什麼不同。關於遺傅和環境的問題，在「種瓜得瓜種豆得豆」裏有適宜的閱發。至於兩者孰為重要，可從作者歸納的幾點看出。「第二，遺傳所賦給於我們的，只是各種特定的能力，並沒有特定的内容。第二點，遺傳的能力，只是一種可能的傾向，也就是一種可塑性的出發點。第三點，人是最具有可塑性的有機體，遺傅能力的能否充分發展，還要由社會的環境來決定的」。「上智與下愚」歸結於智力與學習的關係，在常態分配上，佔絕對多數的是中等智力，個人的成就，還得靠自己的努力，即使有過人的才智，也只有在優良的社會環境與教養中才能發展表現出來，而優良的環境教養，一部分仍可由自己奮鬥的力量去學取。「從良心　全說到品格」，籍抗戰期間組林市民為　勞動上前綫的榮譽軍人舉行的良心獻金，解釋道德之社會的與心理的涵義，並說明品格由行為所構成，又能轉而去影響行為，決定行為。</p>
<p>關於心理衛生運動近年来很為人注意，教育家一致承認惟有應用心理衛生的原則，才可以改善人類的生活，促進社會文化。作才在「酸葡萄甜　檬哲學」中，便根據這些原則，從適應與動機，解釋變態的心理現象，對於各種不良的足以影響心理健康的適應方法，都一一加以剖析，並提示若干心理卫生方法上的要點。「從四書五經和拉丁文崇拜談起」，先將官能心理學「Fachly　Paychclogy形式調視說（Erulcation　as　Fornal　Discipline）學習遷移說（The　Translerssof　Learning）予以客觀的批判，認為形式調練不可靠，又把學習遷移的理論在學習上的應用叙說一過：「首先，我們學習的材料，要注意有直接的實際上的功效。其次我們的學習生活，要注意與實際生活打成一片、要注意從做中去學的原則。又其次學習的方法與指導的方法，對於學習的影響非常重大。」在解釋了幾種學習時比較常見的現象以後，作者的「學習曲綫之話」，主要的是要我們於電曲不平的學習情境下，避地不必要的自滿，自喜，自怨，自餒，鼓起學習熱情和興趣，以增進學習效率。記憶和遺忘，在學習心理學上是常常要討論到的，作者以「好記性不如爛筆頭」這題目，研究這個問題，作者提示給我們的是記憶固然重要，呆記死記却不是辦法，訓　學生多「記」，不如指導他们多「想」。近年成人學習能力的實騐，心理學家說過很多，其結果都證明成人學習能力並不弱。作者選定「少壯不努力老大徒傷悲」一個題目，來說明成人教育的重要及其被漠視的原因，要大家注意成人教育的推進。「讀書的心理」告訴我们如何增進讀書的理解能办，是將科學方法應用於讀書。最後一篇「兩個故事」，引了吕純陽傅道和出賣臭早秘方面個故事，說論述「學習法論者」與「學習論者」各有其是。而作者却折衷了這兩者的觀念：「我們以為學習的本身當然是根本，離開了學習，就無所謂方法。然而學習的方法確也應當重視的，學習方法原是前人從辛苦中得來的經騐，這種經騐大足使我們少走許多回頭路，足使我們增加學習的效率。</p>
<p>就這本書的內容來說，雖是零篇文章的結集，但前後到有一個明顯的示統可尋。從第一篇到最後一篇，可自成一組織，我想這種編著的方法，有教科書的優點，（系統分明）而無教科書的缺陷（編制呆板）寓敎育心理學的原理原則於「趣味化」的叙述，閱讀起來自然不會感到枯燥乏味了。</p>

        <h1>1946.04.13</h1>
<h3>President Chiang Returns to Chongqing from Guiyang, Expresses Gratification at the Eradication of Opium in Guizhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Chongqing News: President Chiang will arrive in Nanjing around the 25th. The President's Office and official residence of the National Government have been prepared. It is said that at the beginning of this month, the President personally instructed Chen Xizeng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the National Government, to be mindful of the scarcity of materials, and to ensure that the arrangements for the official residence are merely clean and tidy. All window curtains and tablecloths should be purchased in gauze, and imported velvet and expensive silk should not be used.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] President Chiang returned to Chongqing by special plane from Guiyang at 4:00 PM on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 12th] At 6:20 AM on the 12th, President Chiang observed the unique revival exercises in Guiyang City. These morning exercises are prescribed by Mayor Yang Jian, with one person from each household utilizing the idle time on the roads in the early morning to concentrate on performing the exercises in sections for 20 minutes. During his inspection, the President expressed great interest in them. At 10:00 AM, he held a tea party at Jianyetang to entertain more than 200 Guizhou gentry, leaders from all walks of life, and heads of government agencies. In his speech, President Chiang briefly stated: "It has been a long time since I last saw you all. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the return to the capital is imminent. Guizhou Province has made great contributions to the War of Resistance, so I have taken the time to come to Guizhou to meet with all of you elders and people. The most gratifying thing is that opium has been eradicated in Guizhou, and the health of the people can be the same as in other provinces, which is very different from the situation eleven years ago, and is truly gratifying. Guizhou needs transportation, and the Guizhou railway will now be constructed by the Central Government. In addition, there are three things I hope that all the elders and people of the province will strive to achieve: (1) Develop public health to enhance the people's physical fitness. (2) Afforestation and tree planting, saying that 'ten years to grow a tree, a hundred years to nurture a person', hoping that when I come again in a year, I will see that all barren mountains have become forests. (3) Improve culture, especially the culture of the Miao people." The speech lasted for 18 minutes. Three representatives of the elders, women, and workers also expressed their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 11:35 AM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 11th] At 9:00 AM on the 11th, Chairman Chiang inspected the 205th Division of the Youth Army at Maijiaqiao and delivered a personal address, first saying: "Since you young men responded to the call of this Chairman in January last year, and gathered under the banner of the National Revolutionary Army, receiving modern military training, it has been one year and four months. During this year and four months, this Chairman has never forgotten you young men, so before returning to the capital, I have come to Guiyang to inspect you, and take this opportunity to tell you about your future responsibilities and directions of effort." He continued: "The responsibility of the Youth Expeditionary Force is to implement the Three Principles of the People, complete the National Revolution, and build our China into a free, equal, and independent modern nation. Today, this Chairman has come to Guizhou to entrust this major responsibility to the shoulders of you young people. In the future, the success or failure of the revolution, the survival of the nation, and whether the Three Principles of the People can be implemented, all depend on whether you young men can be united in sincerity and harmony, obey orders, and strictly observe discipline. This Chairman constantly encourages himself, and will never be unworthy of being your commander and elder brother. At the same time, I also hope that all officers and soldiers will recognize the importance of their own responsibilities, set their goals, and resolve to share life and death, and share hardships. Everyone should encourage themselves to be an anonymous hero of the revolution, taking the implementation of the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, working together with one heart and one mind, and striving to complete the construction of our country. Only in this way can we be worthy of our Founding Father, and not betray our original intention of joining the army to serve the country."</p>
<h3>Broad Scope of Discussions in the United States, Marshall Departs for China to Assist Our Efforts in Achieving Political and Economic Stability</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 12th] General Marshall, after consulting with President Truman, announced: He may leave the United States for China today. General Marshall held a half-hour consultation with Byrnes and President Truman. Marshall said: Their discussions covered a wide range of issues, including the problem of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) transporting supplies to China.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 11th: General Marshall will soon return to China, and the content of General Marshall's talks in Washington will be made public after his return to China. The President replied to a reporter's question, saying: The General's visit and talks were very constructive.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to authoritative sources today: General Marshall has convinced State Department officials that the United States needs to support China's reconstruction efforts with substantial funds. It is expected that the United States will loan China 500 million US dollars, mainly for the purpose of restoring the transportation system. US officials believe that the unity of China is crucial to promoting stability in Asia. The extreme efforts that the United States is currently making are reasonable, and it is equally important to provide China with substantial credit loans to promote its economic situation. Sources familiar with the matter believe that the decision on the above-mentioned loan indicates that President Truman, Secretary of State Byrnes, and Special Envoy Marshall are satisfied that the expansion of the Chinese government's organization is gradually becoming a reality.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Marshall today departed from the United States again to China to carry out a major mission to help the suffering China achieve political unity and economic stability. According to official news received in Washington, Marshall's return to China will find the economic and political situation more serious than when he left China four weeks ago. For example: (1) The Executive Headquarters formed under Marshall's guidance is making smooth progress in mediating internal disputes in various parts of China, but in the chaotic Northeast, work has made no progress. (2) In the Northeast, the government and the Communist army are constantly fighting over which party should restore sovereignty. (3) This military situation is unsettling and has even more tragic economic consequences, as military blockades have been imposed everywhere, especially affecting disaster areas. (4) The major political parties in China, which have reached unity agreements with Marshall's assistance, are now accusing each other, and even President Chiang and Zhou Enlai have publicly accused each other of dishonesty. However, US government officials remain optimistic about the overall situation in China, believing that once the frank and unreserved Marshall returns to his post, the situation will change.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The Chinese authorities here are now arranging housing for Marshall. President Chiang and government officials will come to Nanjing, so Marshall's peace mediation work will also be carried out in Nanjing in the future.</p>

<h3>Suzhou High Court Pronounced Death Sentence Yesterday, Traitor Chen Gongbo to be Executed, Deprived of Public Rights for Life and Property Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent in Suzhou, 12th] At 4:13 PM on the 12th, the traitor Chen Gongbo quietly heard the declaration of "sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and property confiscated." In this late spring March in Suzhou, the flowers and plants are thriving, the little birds on the pines and cypresses outside the court are singing chirpingly, the sunlight is so warm, and the weather is so warm—the entire universe is immersed in the joy of "life." However, for Chen Gongbo, only a ruthless gallows is seen, approaching him step by step!</p>
<p>At exactly 4:00 PM, the first courtroom of the Suzhou High Court was crowded with audiences and reporters from various newspapers. Suddenly there was a commotion, and the masses of people outside the door made way for a horse-drawn carriage to arrive at the High Court under heavy guard. Chen Gongbo is here. He is still wearing the blue-gray serge robe he wore on the day of the trial, holding a black felt hat in his hand, walking calmly into the third waiting room. The people in the courtroom had just sat down, and the bailiff shouted "Court is in session," and everyone became nervous again. First came the Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, followed by the Chief Prosecutor Han 　, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Lu Jiarui, and a clerk. The Presiding Judge said a word softly to the bailiff, and the bailiff walked out. In a moment, Chen Renbo followed him in. Under the strong mercury lamp, Chen Gongbo's expression seemed only tired. On the day of the trial, his eyes were still flashing with the fire of struggle, but today he already knew that everything was over. He was still holding that felt hat in his hand, and the black leather shoes were shiny—but who knows how many more days he can wear them!</p>
<p>The clerk stood up and said: "The case of traitor Chen Gongbo will be pronounced today." Chen Gongbo raised his head and listened quietly, without any panic, but he kept blinking his eyes, his lips were tightly closed, but he seemed to be chewing something, his body was motionless—had he ever had "any fluke thoughts"?</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge's voice: firm, earnest, and calm. He stood firmly reading the main text of the judgment. After the Presiding Judge read the main text, Chen Gongbo was still motionless, but he seemed to be swallowing something, his Adam's apple moving up and down so violently. A pretty female reporter ran over to take a picture of him. Chen Gongbo didn't seem to see it. Can he really face death calmly? Or is he "unafraid of the law"? (The picture shows the expression of the traitor Chen Gongbo after listening to the verdict.)</p>
<h3>Traitor Chen Said He Would No Longer Argue Against the Judgment</h3>
<p>The Presiding Judge's face was frosty, and he read the reasons for the judgment aloud: As for the defendant's defense, it is nothing more than an attempt to reduce his guilt, which is not worth adopting. The defendant is ignorant of righteousness and willing to be the culprit, so he is sentenced to the extreme penalty to make an example. The Presiding Judge then said to him kindly: "The judgment can be sent. According to the regulations for the implementation of special criminal cases, this case should be sent to the Supreme Court for review regardless of whether the defendant objects or not, so it is the duty of this court to send it for review. If there is any defense, it can still be submitted, but if there is a statement of defense, it is best to send it within ten days."</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo listened quietly, still very calm. He said: "I have already said during the last trial that I will never argue." But Presiding Judge Sun told him that this was legally insufficient.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo said: "Thanks to the court for allowing me to publish my statement of defense and confession. I have finished my heart's matter. I understand the position of the prosecutor, he has no choice. And the prosecutor has already expressed his words. I have failed politically, but I have not failed in personality."</p>
<p>He smiled and bowed to the court, and the bailiffs escorted him out. The time was 4:21 PM.</p>
<p>A young lady in the audience praised Chen Gongbo's hair for being combed beautifully, but I thought of the old days when robbers were shot, and the robbers often shouted: "Twenty years later, I will be a good man again!" So the applause thundered. Chen Gongbo's biggest problem in his life is to desperately try to win applause, so that he is exhausted and exhausted. Knowing that it is a dead end, he has to walk and talk again. He has been extremely "performing" this skill. Will he write a crooked poem of "Thoughts on Being Sentenced to Death" in a few days?</p>
<h3>Puyi to be Extradited Soon, Will be Escorted to Nanjing for Trial, Investigation of Traitor Zheng's Property Underway</h3>

After Puyi's extradition, it has been decided to hand him over to the Capital High Court for trial. The estate of the former puppet Manchukuo Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu in the Northeast and Tianjin is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Judgment</h3>
<p>Kiangsu High Court Criminal Judgment, Special Character No. 375, Year 35.</p>
<p>Prosecutor: This Court's Public Prosecutor.</p>
<p>Defendant: Chen Gongbo, male, age 55, native of Nanhai, Guangdong, residing at No. 64 Beiping Road, Nanjing.</p>
<p>Appointed Defense Counsel: Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wuxian County.</p>
<p>The aforementioned defendant, for the case of a traitor, having been prosecuted by this Court's Public Prosecutor, this Court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo colluded with an enemy nation, plotted to resist his own country, and is sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of civil rights.</p>
<p>All assets, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of family members, are to be confiscated.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo was originally a member of the Kuomintang, and was a confidant of the traitor Wang Zhao-ming, successively holding important positions in the central government. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy forces advanced victoriously. Shanghai quickly fell, shaking the capital. The National Government decided on a long-term resistance and moved west to Chongqing, planning a counter-offensive. Unexpectedly, the traitor Wang Zhao-ming violated the established national policy and willingly accepted the utilization of Japan's Konoe Fumimaro, secretly making peace. Chen Gongbo followed Wang, participated in the conspiracy, and at the end of the 27th year (1938), at Wang's summons, secretly went from Chengdu to Hanoi, Vietnam, to continue discussing the peace movement. Wang drafted a telegram advocating peace, which was given to Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and others to take to Hong Kong for publication, in order to echo Konoe's three principles of peace, hoping to confuse the public and obstruct the Central Government's resistance plan. Subsequently, Wang went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic peace plan with the Japanese invaders, establishing a puppet regime. Chen Gongbo traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai, participating in the matter throughout. After the negotiations reached a compromise, on the 30th day of March in the 29th year (1940), they jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang appointed himself as the puppet chairman, while Chen Gongbo served as the president of the puppet Legislative Yuan. In May of the same year, under the guise of a puppet special envoy, he led a delegation to Japan to return courtesies. Later, he also served concurrently as the mayor of puppet Shanghai. Under the protection of the Japanese invaders, he openly usurped official titles, betraying the central government. On the 30th day of November of the same year, the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan was formally signed in Nanjing, and the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued at the same time, recognizing Manchukuo, in order to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders and, on the 9th day of January of the 32nd year (1943), in the name of the puppet National Government, declared war on our allied nations, Great Britain and the United States, and concluded an alliance treaty with the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, under the guise of a puppet ambassador, he traveled to Japan. In March of the following year, Wang went to Japan for medical treatment, and Chen Gongbo acted as chairman of the puppet National Government and chairman of the puppet Military Affairs Commission. From then on, the military and political power of the puppet government was entirely in his hands. After Wang's death, he formally acted as the puppet chairman and concurrently served as the president of the puppet Executive Yuan. He also visited the enemy emperor in Japan in the capacity of a puppet head of state, expressing that he would continue Wang's will to live and die with the Japanese invaders in order to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War. In August of the previous year (1945), because the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled in fear of punishment and hid in Japan. The National Government telegraphed for his arrest and extradition back to the country, and he was transferred to this Court's Public Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The defendant in this case, together with the traitor Wang Zhao-ming, jointly organized the puppet National Government, successively holding various important puppet positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position as the head, taking control of the puppet regime, seizing Nanjing, and issuing orders at will. He has confessed to these facts without denial. There are also records in the Gazette of the Puppet Legislative Yuan of the defendant presiding over meetings and handling Yuan affairs in the name of the puppet president, official documents issued by the defendant in the capacity of puppet mayor in the Shanghai Municipal Gazette, as well as the appointment letters seized in another case of the defendant, in his capacity as acting chairman of the puppet National Government, appointing Chu Yi as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and the puppet Guangzhou Pacification Director, which can be used as evidence. Regarding how Wang Zhao-ming informed him of his plan to secretly make peace with the Japanese invaders before leaving Chongqing, inviting him to secretly go to Hanoi, Vietnam, to send a telegram advocating peace, in order to coordinate with the enemy Konoe Fumimaro's peace declaration. How he was summoned by Wang to Shanghai to negotiate the basic treaty of relations with the Japanese invaders. After the establishment of the puppet government, he went to Japan in the name of a puppet special envoy to return courtesies, and then issued the joint declaration of China and Japan, openly recognizing Manchukuo. And how, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he declared war on Great Britain and the United States in the name of the puppet National Government, and signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. He repeatedly traveled to the east to visit the enemy chieftains, declaring that he would swear to live and die with them. His confession and testimony in this Court also stated these facts in detail. Combined with the "Record of the Puppet National Government Delegation's Visit to Japan to Return Courtesies" compiled and printed by the puppet Propaganda Department, "Collection of Chen Gongbo's Speeches during his Visit to Japan to Return Courtesies," "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government" published by the Political Monthly Magazine, and the records in the "Shanghai Municipal Gazette" and the "Overseas News Clipping Book," all are consistent. Therefore, the defendant's collusion with the Japanese invaders, secretly making peace, establishing a puppet regime, and openly betraying the central government, are extremely obvious. He should be found guilty under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, of colluding with an enemy nation to plot resistance against his own country. As for the defendant's reasons for defense, they are divided into five points. (1) He said: "The party cannot be divided, and the country must be unified, so I did not approve of Wang's departure from Chongqing and the organization of the puppet government, and repeatedly advised against it to no avail. I only remained because the relationship was too deep, and I could not bear to leave abruptly." (2) He said: "I have always expressed opposition to the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, and after repeated requests, it has been abolished, and I have also negotiated with the Japanese invaders to abolish Manchukuo." (3) He said: "Making peace with the Japanese invaders was to seek the realization of overall peace, so I have never had hostile actions towards the Chongqing government. Although the puppet government declared war on Great Britain and the United States, it did not actually send troops. The purpose was only to avoid the Japanese invaders looting resources." (4) He said: "The people in the occupied areas suffered great losses, and the puppet government provided rescue, and the national vitality was preserved to a considerable extent." (5) He said: "After the Japanese invaders surrendered, I maintained public order in Nanjing to await the National Army's takeover. Afterwards, I went to Japan to await orders, and it was not a flight." And so on. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<h3>UN Representatives Draft International Military Formation Plan to Prevent or Destroy Aggression; Staff Committee's Power is Extremely Great</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] More than two UN representatives are currently in the quiet environment of the uppermost suite of a hotel in midtown New York, drafting an international military formation plan. This international military force will become the world's most powerful force to prevent or, if necessary, destroy aggression. According to the UN Charter, the responsibility of the international military is to advise and assist the UN Security Council in dealing with various issues arising from the maintenance of world peace and security that require the use of force, and to assist the Security Council in handling the deployment and command of troops, and the adjustment and reduction of armaments. This international military, in order to implement the resolutions of the Security Council, may have full authority to use force if it deems that the use of diplomatic and economic sanctions or the severance of transportation and communications is still ineffective. It can be seen from this that the power of the Staff Committee in the future will be great. To implement its resolutions, the Security Council may use demonstrations, blockades, or dispatch UN land, sea, and air forces. The Staff Committee is composed of the Chiefs of Staff of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France as permanent members, and the other participating representatives are all senior military advisors from their respective countries' land, sea, and air forces. What is currently under discussion is how many troops and equipment the 51 member states will provide for the international military. Observers generally believe that the majority of the air and naval forces will be provided by the United States, while the Soviet Union will contribute the largest number of land forces. The committee is currently inviting the Security Council to review Article 43 of the UN Charter from a military perspective.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Death Anniversary; Truman's Speech Praises His Life's Achievements; US Foreign Policy Fixed and Unchanging</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Hyde Park, New York, 12th] Today is the anniversary of the death of President Roosevelt. President Truman praised the achievements of his predecessor at the commemorative ceremony. Many domestic and international dignitaries attended the ceremony. At the same time, the US government held a ceremony to accept the late President's Hyde Park home as a national historic landmark. Truman said in his speech: Civilians around the world, as well as their leaders and government officials, all acknowledge that the survival of culture is largely due to him alone. Only history can give him a fair judgment. The loss suffered by the United States due to Roosevelt's death is indescribable. Internationally, President Roosevelt's goal was for our country to occupy the position of a good neighbor and to participate in world affairs with an active, intelligent, and constructive attitude. Our hope for the future of culture and life depends on the success of the United Nations. He not only recognized this truth but was determined to work to implement it and has put it into practice. His foreign policy was to adopt a fair, sympathetic, and firm attitude when dealing with other countries, while recognizing our responsibility to other countries' starving and homeless people. This policy also recognizes the sacred responsibility of this country to countries that have been devastated by fighting to the death against totalitarian politics. We are determined to devote our full efforts to these principles of international cooperation. We will work to make the United Nations a strong and dynamic institution and strive to find effective ways to alleviate suffering and treat all countries fairly. These principles are the foundation of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, and our current foreign policy is also based on these principles. The overall work after the global war is indeed very difficult, but in short, this work is to complete President Roosevelt's basic domestic and foreign policies. Due to changes in the situation, there may be some slight modifications, but the main principles remain fixed and unchanging. We are here today not only to commemorate the immortal spirit of Roosevelt but also to gain strength for the future because we are inspired by the humanism that was promoted by his achievements and inspired those achievements.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman, having been in office for a year as of Thursday, addressed the nation, saying: We are on the way to balancing the budget and are moving toward full peacetime production.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Spain and the United Nations</h3>
<p>Since the United Nations Security Council convened in New York, it first encountered difficulties with the Iranian issue. Now, the Spanish issue will cause divergent opinions. It is truly a case of one wave subsiding only for another to rise. The Soviet representative initially stated that the Soviet Union had begun withdrawing its troops from Iran, and an agreement had been re-established between the two countries. However, the Iranian representative denied the Soviet Union's actions, not only failing to withdraw its complaint from the United Nations but also insisting on its position. The British and American representatives, in order to uphold international law and protect small countries, and to safeguard the authority of the United Nations organization, supported Iran. The Soviet representative staged a performance of requesting the floor at the meeting, and ultimately, the Soviet representative angrily withdrew from the meeting. The Security Council, in response to the evolving situation, granted a period for discussion. Precisely at this juncture, the Iranian situation has developed, becoming increasingly clear. The United Nations Security Council's handling of the Iranian issue has therefore attracted worldwide attention. However, just as the sudden storm of the Iranian issue was being discussed, another issue appeared before the United Nations Security Council: the issue concerning the situation in Spain.</p>
<p>According to a United Nations dispatch from New York on the 10th: The Polish representative, Mr. Rychinski, today petitioned the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, requesting the Security Council to take action against the Spanish Franco government, on the grounds that Spain has threatened world peace and is sheltering fleeing Nazis and their assets, and that German scientists are planning new methods of warfare. Another dispatch from the Associated Press in New York on the 10th stated that Poland requested the United Nations organization to take action against the Spanish Franco government, and accused scientists hiding in Spain of potentially conducting research on atomic bombs and rockets under the protection of the Spanish government, which is sufficient to endanger international peace and security. This newspaper quoted a broadcast from New York on the 11th as stating: It was officially announced that Poland requested the United Nations Security Council to include the Spanish issue on the agenda. The United States expressed its support, but will likely continue to oppose the Security Council taking action against Franco. It can be seen that the Spanish issue, having been raised by Poland, will inevitably be discussed by the United Nations. As for what steps will be taken in the future and how the Spanish issue will evolve within the United Nations organization, there is no need to speculate at this time. However, there are several points to note regarding the presentation of the Spanish issue to this session of the Security Council:</p>
<p>First, the Spanish issue was raised by Poland to the Security Council, and Poland is in reality no different from a seat attached to the Soviet Union. Poland's raising of the Spanish issue to the Security Council, if not directly instructed by the Soviet Union, must have received its support. The issue was raised immediately after the United Nations dealt with the Iranian issue. During the handling of the Iranian issue, the firm attitude of Britain and the United States made the Soviet representative feel embarrassed. Now that the Iranian issue is becoming clear, we see the Spanish issue being raised, perhaps with the intention of placing Britain and the United States in the same embarrassing position as the Soviet Union had been. Originally, regarding the Spanish issue, there had been no action taken after Britain and the United States criticized Franco. Poland's raising of the Spanish issue within the United Nations organization is intended to force the United Nations to take action against Franco. However, the views of Britain, the United States, and other countries on the Spanish issue are not necessarily the same as those of the Soviet Union and Poland. Since the Spanish "People's Army" was destroyed by Franco and the political situation in Spain became stable, some countries have attempted to destroy Franco's regime with international pressure. However, while countries like Britain and the United States have no sympathy for the Franco regime, their methods differ. According to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Washington on the 11th, the French government's proposal to impose economic sanctions on the Franco government has been rejected by the United States. The reason for the rejection is roughly that American figures believe that imposing economic sanctions on Franco would only strengthen his position within the country. Therefore, the significance of raising the Spanish issue is somewhat the same as raising the Iranian issue to the Security Council, but the positions of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are different, changing from initiative to defense, and from defense to initiative.</p>
<p>Second, the significance of the Spanish issue and the Iranian issue is different. The former is a domestic issue, while the latter is an international issue, involving treaty relations and the issue of stationing troops. Whether the Franco regime is supported by the Spanish people should be decided by the Spanish people themselves, according to the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. In particular, we Chinese people deeply resent Franco's retrogressive actions, his subservience to the Axis powers, and his recognition of the puppet regime that appeared within Chinese territory. Now that the Axis powers have collapsed, Spain's past crimes should be liquidated and punished. However, we must remember that hating Franco's crimes is one thing, and liquidating and punishing Franco's crimes is another. The liquidation and punishment of Franco's crimes must be carried out by the Spanish people themselves. If an attempt is made to destroy the Franco regime in Spain by external force, which is currently a force for stability, it will not only invite the resentment of the Spanish people, turning instead to strengthen the Franco regime, but it also has the appearance of interfering in internal affairs. This should not set a bad precedent in future international relations.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization is a newly born institution. Regardless of its inherent conditions, the safety and security of the future international order are tied to the actions of the United Nations organization. In the operation of the United Nations organization, things are in their infancy, lacking established rules. Therefore, there are so-called procedural issues in dealing with some international problems. However, if an issue is clearly a domestic issue and is still placed on the agenda, even if no action is taken, this itself is close to interfering in internal affairs. Whether this is in accordance with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter is worth noting. We must remember that the safety and security of the world depend on how the United Nations organization is used in the future. Therefore, the United Nations must not be negligent or make the wrong move in handling any issue!</p>
<h3>Verdict of the Supreme Court on the Traitor Chen Gongbo</h3>
<p>(Continued from the First Page) Regarding the first point, it is verified that the defendant colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the central government. If, as the defendant claims, he tried to dissuade them but to no avail, he should have weighed the importance of the matter at that time to decide whether to leave or stay. Instead, the defendant responded to Wang's summons, secretly went to Hanoi, issued a telegram advocating peace on his behalf, and then jointly organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing, taking on important positions. After Wang's death, he succeeded to his position and became the ringleader. On the 13th anniversary of the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, he broadcasted a statement declaring that he would inherit Wang's legacy and work closely with Japan and Manchukuo to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. This broadcast speech is evidenced by a recording from the enemy country. This is enough to show that the defendant abandoned allegiance and chose treachery, acting irrationally and at the expense of everything, taking actions that would lose power and humiliate the country. Although he devoted his loyalty to Wang alone, he brought immense harm to the country and the nation. Moreover, the defendant, under the protection of the Japanese invaders, stole control of the southeast, which had already formed a division of the country. Furthermore, he organized the puppet Kuomintang and convened the Sixth National Congress, using it as a means of appeal. The so-called "The party cannot be divided, the country must be unified" is clearly self-contradictory. Regarding the second point, according to the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan, Japan had the right to station troops in Mongolia and northern China, and to station fleets in our territorial waters, as well as to implement economic cooperation, allowing the Japanese invaders to infringe on sovereignty and plunder resources. The defendant himself even knew that this was an unequal and harsh treaty. However, he echoed Wang, and the puppet Legislative Yuan, which he was in charge of, passed it, which would make our country subject to its restrictions and forever become a vassal of the Japanese invaders, sacrificing the country and the nation at all costs. Even if he expressed opposition beforehand and demanded its abolition afterward, he cannot evade responsibility with this. Moreover, although the Basic Treaty has been abolished, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was subsequently signed, forming an alliance with the enemy country, and the relationship became even closer. This ran counter to the central government's national policy of resistance and was detrimental to the country. Furthermore, the defendant first issued a joint declaration with Wang and the Japanese and Manchukuo, and then on February 26, 1945, broadcasted a celebration of the 13th anniversary of the establishment of Manchukuo. He consistently recognized the existence of Manchukuo. The impact of this was sufficient to undermine the integrity of our country's territory. Yet, he still argued that he had negotiated with the Japanese invaders to cancel Manchukuo, but who can believe this? Regarding the third point, the defendant's agreement with Wang and the Japanese invaders to make peace violated our national policy of resistance and betrayed the central government, setting up a separate puppet government. In the puppet Central Political Conference, it was resolved that "After the capital is returned, all internal and external political decrees and treaty agreements of Chongqing are invalid, all troops should immediately cease fighting and await orders, and all civil servants should report to Nanjing as soon as possible." This is evidenced by the records in the book "Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government." The resolution falsely claimed that "the capital has been returned" and denied the existence of the Chongqing government, clearly revealing its intention to eliminate the central government and attempt to replace it. The claim that there was never any hostile behavior toward the Chongqing government is self-defeating. Furthermore, according to our country's established policy, we were allied with the democratic front of Britain and the United States to resist the Axis powers of Germany and Japan. However, the defendant and Wang established a puppet regime and joined hands with the enemy country Japan, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. Their purpose was to rely on the Axis powers, destroy Britain and the United States, and isolate our central resistance, in order to achieve their treasonous plan, which is extremely obvious. The claim that this was to resist Japan's plundering of resources is also a deceptive excuse. Regarding the fourth point, the Japanese invaders, due to their inability to control the occupied areas, created puppet governments for their own use, in order to achieve their goals of using Chinese to control Chinese and using war to support war. After the defendant and Wang organized the puppet government, they catered to the wishes of the Japanese invaders. The malpractices they implemented in the occupied areas, such as plundering resources, issuing counterfeit currency, selling opium publicly, enslaving young people, and implementing village clearance and blockades, were all acts that harmed the country and the people. This can be seen from the documents of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government that were obtained by this court and the telegrams between the defendant and Chu Minyi that were seized in another case. All of the above were vicious plans from the Japanese invaders' political aggression, and their harmful effects were more than enough to destroy the country and the race. The defendant still claimed that he was rescuing the people and preserving their vitality, but in reality, it was quite the opposite. Regarding the fifth point, since the puppet government was a puppet institution, it lost its foundation after the Japanese invaders surrendered and was bound to disintegrate at the same time. At that time, Japanese surrendered generals Imai and Okamura were in Nanjing awaiting orders. Before the arrival of the National Army, they should still be responsible for maintaining local order in accordance with the surrender orders, and there was no need for the defendant to provide assistance. Moreover, the defendant only had a small number of remaining troops stationed in Nanjing, which was insignificant. Even if he had ordered his subordinates to maintain security together with the enemy army, it was only because he was in dire straits and had no choice but to submit. How can he hope to be forgiven for this? Furthermore, if the defendant was sincerely awaiting punishment, he should have awaited orders in Nanjing no matter what the circumstances, but instead, he hastily fled to Japan, which is nothing but fleeing from justice. In summary, all kinds of defenses are just excuses, hoping to reduce or avoid guilt, and are all inadmissible. The Japanese invaders had long harbored the conspiracy to annex our country. Since the September 18th Incident, they had occupied our four northeastern provinces and established the puppet Manchukuo. Then, they sent troops to Inner Mongolia and advanced into Pingjin, which led to the July 7th Incident. Our country, having endured enough, rose up to resist in order to ensure the survival of the nation. The entire country, from top to bottom, united to face the national crisis in order to win the final victory. The defendant, who was originally a key member of the central government, should have understood this deeply. However, due to the initial setbacks of our army in the early stages of the war, his will was shaken, and he then echoed Wang and willingly allowed himself to be used by the Japanese invaders. At a critical juncture when the situation was reversed, he secretly fled, sent a telegram advocating peace, and then organized a puppet government, betraying the central government. He also concluded an alliance with the Japanese invaders, brazenly declaring war on our British and American allies. He repeatedly undermined the national policy of resistance and aided the Japanese invaders' aggression, placing the country and the nation in a state of eternal doom. He was truly ignorant of the greater good and willingly became a chief culprit. There is no leniency under the law. He should be sentenced to death to serve as a warning. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated.</p>

<h3>A Day Will Surely Come When You Can Spend Your Honeymoon on the Moon in a "Spaceship"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris Dispatch] French young scientist Ananoff has conducted various studies on a "moon trip". According to his announcement, the distance between the Earth and the Moon can be greatly shortened, and there will surely be a day when it will be possible to travel from Paris to the Moon and back in three and a half hours. Ananoff has created a special means of transportation called the "spaceship", which will be publicly exhibited in a Paris museum in the coming months. Because there is no air on the surface of the moon, passengers must bring their own air tanks. At the same time, when humans walk on the surface of the moon, because the moon's gravity is much weaker than the earth's gravity, if passengers do not tie heavy lead to their legs, they will involuntarily jump. However, Ananoff has already solved this difficulty in advance, and has also found a way to reduce the speed of the spaceship's landing, and designed a method for departing from the moon and returning to Earth. According to what he said to people, we will surely be able to travel to the moon for a weekend trip during our lifetime, and newlyweds can truly spend their "honeymoon trip". The invention of atomic energy and radar waves solves all difficulties, which is something that idealists like the British H.G. Wells could never have dreamed of, he said.</p>

<h3>Solving the Housing Crisis: Specific Measures Stipulated; Executive Yuan Convenes Allocation Committee with Military and Political Organs, Prioritizing Rental to Returning Organs and Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, met with Liu Gongyun, Director of the Enemy Property Administration, for a lengthy period. It is reported that the content of the discussion was related to resolving the housing difficulties of various organs and civil servants. It is confirmed that, in view of the extreme difficulty faced by personnel from various organs returning to Shanghai to find housing after the victory, and with the continuous repatriation of enemy aliens, the Executive Yuan has decided on a policy of disposing of enemy and puppet properties entirely, and taking into consideration the rights and interests of the original owners of the houses occupied by enemy aliens, as well as relieving the housing difficulties of various organs and civil servants. The following measures are specifically stipulated for the allocation of housing in Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) Houses occupied by enemy aliens that are owned by enemies or puppets shall be taken over and sold by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. The Shanghai Municipal Government shall be responsible for guarding them before the sale.</p>
<p>(2) For houses occupied by enemy aliens that are not owned by enemies or puppets, the property rights shall be investigated and returned to the original owners by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration.</p>
<p>(3) In order to meet the urgent needs of repatriation, the aforementioned houses shall be leased uniformly by the Central Trust Bureau for a term of one year. Tenants must sign a contract guaranteeing the monthly payment of the prescribed rent and agreeing to vacate upon expiration without renewal or transfer. Violators will be ordered to move out.</p>
<p>(4) The aforementioned houses shall be prioritized for rental to organs and civil servants returning to Shanghai. The Shanghai Organ Housing Allocation Committee organized by this Yuan shall review and allocate them, and submit them to this Yuan for record.</p>
<p>(5) Those who have not been approved to reside in the aforementioned houses shall be ordered to move out within a specified period.</p>
<p>(6) Organs or civil servants originally residing in enemy or puppet properties shall be ordered to move out within a specified period. Those who have been approved for rental or have a necessary reason to remain in Shanghai may pre-emptively allocate from the houses being leased.</p>
<p>(7) With regard to the aforementioned items 5 and 6, if the residents who are required to move out fail to do so after the deadline, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters shall enforce it. In addition, the Executive Yuan, together with the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, and the Songhu Garrison Command, etc., have organized the Shanghai Organ Housing Allocation Committee, with Qian Dajun serving as the acting chairman, Peng Xuepei serving as the vice-chairman, and Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiqing, Li Jilan, Liu Gongyun, Huang Boji, Li Chongshi, Xuan Tiewu, Song Siyi, and Wang Guanghan serving as members. The committee will convene a meeting soon to coordinate housing allocation matters based on these measures.</p>
<p>Summoning Industry and Commerce Leaders to Discuss Wage Issues</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Executive Yuan President Song summoned leaders from the city’s industrial and commercial sectors on the 11th to discuss wage issues, with over twenty attendees including Wu Kaixian and Pan Gongzhan. During the meeting, some advocated for a minimum wage standard, while others preferred a maximum wage standard. Director Wu, however, believed that factory units should be the basis, as factories vary in size. Setting a minimum wage would make it difficult for small factories to sustain themselves. As a result, Premier Song instructed Director Wu to conduct a detailed investigation of wage conditions in various factories for further review.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun: Opium Addiction; Unregistered; Taken Away by Officials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Film star Yuan Meiyun is deeply addicted to opium. Yesterday morning at approximately 8:00 AM, the Changshu Road Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau sent officers to her residence to bring her in for questioning. According to Yuan's confession, she has been smoking opium for two years, is still currently smoking, and has not registered with the police. She was immediately transferred to the Criminal Police Division of the General Bureau and then to the court for handling. Furthermore, regarding joint liability for opium prohibition, according to the regulations on Baojia personnel assisting in opium prohibition, only the head of the household is responsible for the joint liability of opium addicts in their household. If the head of the household is an opium addict, they will be subject to legal punishment, and their family members are not jointly liable. Regarding Vice Mayor He’s explanation mentioned yesterday, concerning "family members, etc., must also be jointly liable," the Municipal Government has declared that Mr. He did not mention it, and it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Pan Sansheng, Wu Songgao: Families Hope to Communicate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The former Puppet Judicial Administration Minister Wu Songgao and "Shanghai celebrity" Pan Sansheng were interrogated by the High Procuratorate yesterday morning. When the bailiffs escorted them from the prison to the courtroom, their family members rushed forward attempting to speak with them (as yesterday was the day for family members to deliver food), but they were stopped by the bailiffs. In addition to these two, those interrogated yesterday also included Liu Yusheng (cultural traitor), Liu Xingchen (Director of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Goods Allocation Office), Dai Ailu (Manager of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch), Huang Xianggu, Jiang Shangda, Fan Yongzeng, Yan Jiaqi, Zou Baoshan, and Bu Shuhua, among others.</p>
<h3>Revised Standards for Calculating Rent: Commercial Buildings at 180 Times Pre-War Levels, Residential Buildings at 140 Times</h3>
<p>During yesterday morning's municipal government meeting, it was resolved to revise the standards for calculating rent in this city. Residential buildings were revised to 140 times the rent in 1937, and commercial buildings were revised to 180 times. Property donations will be collected at the original rate of 14% based on 180 times, to be borne by the landlords, starting from April of this year.</p>
<h3>Rent Increase: Shanghai Real Estate Merchants Say Landlords Still Have No Profit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently inquired about the revised rent issue with real estate merchants in this city. It is understood that these merchants believe that the municipal government's measure is still a fair solution for the time being. The multiplier is also considered appropriate. Considering the exchange rate between legal tender and puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, the multiplier is not small. However, landlords still cannot discuss profits with the increased multiplier, at most only slightly supplementing the cost of managing the houses. In addition, property donations will also increase, plus 14% for the City Defense Corps uniform fee, stamp duty, and the upcoming rental income tax, land donations, etc., all of which must be deducted from the increased multiplier, so the actual gain is very limited. The cost of managing houses is enormous, especially insurance, which has increased to 2,000 times the pre-war amount, making it difficult for landlords to cope.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the Legislative Yuan has drafted a tax rate for rental income tax and is currently seeking opinions from the City Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association. It is said that those with an annual net rental income of over 10 million yuan will be taxed at 12%, and those with over 50 million yuan will be taxed at 18%.</p>
<h3>Northern Shipping Line Shipments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire are assisting in the transportation of relief supplies by deploying more ships to the Northern Line. The "Nanchang" sailed to Qinhuangdao on the 10th, carrying 79,000 bags of relief flour. The "Hubei" sailed to Tianjin yesterday, the "Yongsheng" will sail to Qingdao today, and the "Shandong" is scheduled to sail to Tanggu next Monday, all with large quantities of relief supplies heading to North China. Furthermore, on the international route, the American President Lines' "Seal" is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to return to New York tomorrow. The "Grant President" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong via Manila on the 16th and depart for the United States on the 17th, reportedly carrying a large quantity of pig bristles to the United States. In addition, the famous "Changxing" steamship company's "Empress" mail ship, which operates on the Pacific Line, suffered damage during the war when its ships assisted in military transport. The company's Shanghai branch is now preparing and scheduled to reopen on the 15th of this month. The date of the "Empress" mail ship's arrival is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Motor and Silk Weaving Industry Labor Dispute: Municipal Government's Handling Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the motor and silk weaving industry labor dispute in this city, the labor side demands a base salary of 2.2 yuan, while the management offers 1.2 yuan. Both sides have requested the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee to arbitrate. It is reported that the municipal government has now decided that any base salary adjustments before the 12th of this month will not be counted, and no base salary increases will be allowed thereafter. Wages will continue to be implemented according to the cost of living index. Therefore, the motor and silk weaving industry labor dispute will also be handled according to this method.</p>

<h3>China is the Most Heavily Affected; Starving People are Everywhere: UNRRA Director's Representative Mooney Issues Statement After Inspecting Disaster Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mooney, the representative of the Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was ordered in late February to come to China to inspect the relief and rehabilitation work in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Qingdao, Hebei, Rehe, Peiping, Tianjin, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and various other areas in order to report to the Washington Headquarters. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, he held a press conference at the Riverside Mansion, accompanied by Caesar, the UNRRA Director for China, to answer questions. Mooney made the following statement:</p>
<p>China has suffered the most from eight years of bitter fighting. Hundreds of cities have been severely damaged, and millions of refugees have been displaced, unable to return home. The suffering of hunger, cold, poverty, and disease is unbearable. The number of people dying from hunger and disease is already quite alarming. UNRRA has entrusted the China Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to expedite the transportation of food and other supplies for relief. However, transportation is extremely difficult due to poor transportation, especially in Central China. In areas where land and water transportation cannot transport materials, air transport is planned. UNRRA's own supply of rice and wheat is also very limited, with US$675,000,000 already shipped to China. In order to relieve its millions of starving people, China cannot rely entirely on imported food. At this critical moment, China can still find ways to compensate, namely: (1) Some areas and some Communist-controlled areas still have surplus food, which should be distributed as much as possible. (2) Some restaurants and guesthouses in cities can be reduced, and upper-middle-class families can often try to save on meals. UNRRA materials are entirely for relieving those in need. In China, there are two aspects to this project: relief and construction, and the cost of construction is much greater than that of relief.</p>
<p>Before coming to China, I had heard various criticisms about the China Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, so I came here to inspect from many aspects. The administration has made mistakes in the past, but we are also not immune. As with the establishment of any new organization, the administration has inevitably encountered various difficulties, but the work is now making great progress. Two months ago, a large number of materials were piled up on the Shanghai docks, but were not transported. Today, they have been transported in large quantities to the interior, undergoing difficult transportation through more than a dozen dangerous and narrow roads. I am quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Mooney also answered reporters' questions, stating that relief supplies have been transported to communist-controlled areas, but transportation is very difficult. The materials are first transported to Peiping, then through the Great Wall and other places, from the last location controlled by the Chinese Central Government to the front lines of the communist-controlled areas, which is also a very complicated process.</p>
<p>UNRRA has shipped 200,000 tons of food to China. The provinces most in need of food are Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Relief and Repair of Damaged Houses</p>
<p>(Another Report) The damage to houses in the recovered areas is extremely serious, especially in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi provinces. The administration has decided in principle to first assist in the repair of cities with more than 50% damage, but only public buildings such as hospitals, kindergartens, primary schools, markets, and important charitable organizations. Private repair or reconstruction of houses is not planned to be subsidized. The various reports in a news release on the 10th from a certain news agency are not factual.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief He Inspects Military Supply Warehouses; Rumor Says He Will Coordinate Distribution to Replenish National Army</h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief He, accompanied by Commander Tang and his entourage, departed from Nanjing on the 10th to inspect garrisons and warehouses along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, arriving in Shanghai by special train around 7:00 PM the night before. Yesterday, He spent the entire day in Jiangwan and Yangshupu, inspecting the military supply warehouses received by the Ministry of Military Affairs. It is said that he will continue the inspection today. There are also rumors of a meeting to address the complete disposition of the military supplies and materials that have been received for half a year, in order to coordinate the replenishment of equipment and supplies to our various units. According to reports, the Ministry of Military Affairs has received dozens of warehouses in this city, and the military supplies and materials received rank first on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Yesterday, He first went to the Shanghai Command Post of the Third Front Army on Jiangwan Road at 9:00 AM for inspection. After half an hour, he accompanied Commander Tang, Commander Huang Zhenqiu of the Logistics Department, Superintendent Yang Zhengmin of the Military Transportation Department, Commander Zhao Zhiyao of the Rear Supply Department, Railway Military Transportation Commander Jiang Chuou, and his entourage in more than ten cars to inspect various military supply warehouses in the Jiangwan area. At 9:40 AM, He's car arrived at the First Automobile Repair Factory of the Rear Services Department, where he was accompanied by He Yiming, Commander of the Automobile Corps, and others to inspect the repair factory and warehouse for thirty minutes. He and Commander Tang transferred to the Tenth Warehouse, and then to the Ninth Warehouse in Maqiao for inspection. Then, he went to the sports field warehouse in the city center. After the inspection, He drove to the Sino-American Cooperative Organization training center for inspection. At 12:30 PM, the car returned to the Shanghai Command Post of the Third Front Army on Jiangwan Road for lunch. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, He and his entourage continued their inspection, first visiting the Peace Museum, which displays antiques presented by Japanese residents. He was very interested in the antiques on display, especially admiring the authentic manuscripts of Shi Kefa and Yue Fei. At 2:40 PM, accompanied by Wei Jimin, Director of the Naval Office in Shanghai, and others, he went to Yangshupu to inspect the naval factory and naval warehouse, returning only in the evening. At 7:00 PM, Commander Huang Zhenqiu of the Logistics Department, Superintendent Yang Zhengmin of the Military Transportation Department, and Commander Zhao Zhiyao of the Rear Supply Department hosted a joint banquet for Commander-in-Chief He, Commander Tang, and He's entourage at the Haige Road Reception Center. It is reported that He and his entourage are scheduled to return to Nanjing by special train tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Shen Weisheng Removed from Garrison Command</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shen Weisheng, manager of the Shanghai Civil Transportation Shipping Bureau at 367 Jiangxi Road, 5th floor, privately solicited business for the "Hai Su" ship carrying National Army troops northward. After investigation by the city's military authorities, he was arrested and transferred to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation in accordance with the law. As for the previous report of government officials protecting him, it is possible that merchants were using false pretenses for fraud, which will be revealed after interrogation.</p>
<h3>Former Director of Puppet Salt Tax Administration, Liu Qian'an, Tried Yesterday; Cries with Family During Meeting; Nightclub Manager's Case Sentenced Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard four cases of suspected traitors in the morning and afternoon, and sentenced one case, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Liu Qian'an</p>
<p>Sixty-four years old, from Fuzhou, is a Christian. He resides at 77 Jianye Li, Fulilu Road. Due to his former position as Director of the Puppet Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Salt Tax Administration, he was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The defendant is old and frail, with white hair. He was escorted to the court by bailiffs yesterday and stated: He studied in the United States at public expense in his early years. After returning to China in 1912, he served in the Sichuan salt affairs authorities and once served as a specialist member of the Hebei-Chahar Construction Committee in Peiping. Later, he resigned and came to Shanghai. When the war broke out, he worked to rescue wounded soldiers, relieve refugees, and rescue comrades in distress. General Feng, who sacrificed heroically in the Battle of Taierzhuang, had his orphaned daughter raised by me. Later, due to unbearable family burdens, I took the position of Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Salt Tax Administration under the Puppet Reformed Government in April 1940. When the Puppet National Government was established, it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Puppet Ministry of Finance. I resigned at the end of June last year when the administration was dismantled. However, during my tenure, I did not seek fame or profit. Protecting the Haizhou salt fields and transporting salt to supply the people in the interior were all beneficial to the country. He couldn't help but sigh. The court allowed him to meet with his family, and they couldn't help but cry together. The court ordered him to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinming</p>
<p>Sun Zhiyou and Wu Jiaqi were accused of forming a "Rickshaw Association" with the Japanese in the Hongkou District of Shanghai during the enemy occupation period, oppressing rickshaw pullers. The defendants denied the allegations, and the court ordered the case to be continued at a later date.</p>
<p>Wang Yongqing</p>
<p>A native of Zhejiang, he served as a plainclothes police officer in the puppet police bureau. The two cases of Ruan Defu being accused of serving as an informant for the enemy Seymour Road Military Police were both concluded after arguments, and the court ordered the sentencing to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 19th.</p>
<p>Yuan Shixiang</p>
<p>The case of Chen Zhuanzhang (nightclub manager) being accused of treason by Iraqi national Li Wei was concluded after interrogation, and the verdict was announced yesterday afternoon. The main text: This case is beyond jurisdiction and is transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for handling. The plaintiff's incidental civil claim is rejected.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Traitor Property Inventoried and Transferred</h3>
<p>A certain military agency, under orders, arrested traitors in Shanghai and transferred them in batches to the High Court and the Army Headquarters for trial. A large amount of traitor property that was sealed under orders has also been inventoried and will be transferred to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration for receipt starting today. Each traitor's property inventory is divided into seven categories: (1) Real estate, including title deeds and land deeds. (2) Negotiable instruments, including bank deposit receipts. (3) Stocks, including government bonds and securities. (4) Ornaments, including jewelry and diamonds. (5) Gold, silver, and banknotes, including gold bars and foreign currency.

<h3>US Dollar Ascends, Eager Buyers Abound - Gold Prices Rise Accordingly - Rumors Persist of Further Appreciation of the US Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of upward movement in the US dollar continued. A portion of gold held as collateral was being returned due to the abundance of loose monetary conditions. Those who play both gold and stocks were compelled to cover short positions, resulting in increased buyer enthusiasm. Furthermore, rumors persisted of further appreciation of the US currency. Stimulated by the US dollar, the gold market was also driven higher. The long-dormant gold market experienced a slight surge in activity. Upon inspection, the market opened flat in the morning. Subsequently, some longs took profits, initially reaching 1,450,000. However, with the US dollar appreciating and buyer demand remaining strong, those with deficits continued to cover their short positions in preparation for repayment to the original owners. This subsequently created a situation of demand exceeding supply, gradually recovering to 1,560,000 before oscillating. Nevertheless, support largely remained around 1,510,000, as arbitrage positions created based on the US dollar persisted. At noon, the market hovered around 1,535,000. In the afternoon, buying interest did not wane, and prices briefly rose to 1,590,000 before experiencing a slight pullback. As a result, prices closed up 80,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry in silver shops was priced at 170,000, refined silver at 1,500, and silver dollars were offered for sale at 1,030 yuan. The black market interest rate remained loose, ranging from 1.2 to 1.7 fen.</p>
<p>Due to frequent rumors from various sources that the US dollar was expected to appreciate further, buyer demand for US dollars was eager, and banks were readily accepting them. The market opened in the morning at 1,910 yuan, and buyers continued to push the price up to 1,970 yuan before experiencing a slight consolidation. At noon, the price remained above 1,950 yuan. Arbitrage spreads continued to hover around 760 yuan per ten taels. In the afternoon, the market continued to prosper, driven by buyer activity. As a result, the market closed up 75 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong banknotes remained stable, with new and old issues largely trading on par. New issues closed up 5 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were priced at 400 yuan, and Philippine pesos at 500 yuan. The bank rate for US dollars also rose to around 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Major Players Manipulate the Market - Government Bonds Fluctuate Erratically</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds continued to decline, surrounded by what are commonly referred to as large market players engaging in selling pressure. Some longs were initiating short positions. Series C bonds opened in the morning at 4,400 yuan, briefly rising to around 4,800 yuan. Subsequently, large players led the selling, creating an atmosphere of strong selling pressure, pushing prices down by as much as 600 yuan, reaching a low of around 4,200 yuan. The market then consolidated, hovering around 4,300 yuan at noon. As a result, prices closed down another 250 yuan from the previous day. Other series (A, B, and D) also experienced declines of slightly less than 100 yuan, while Series E experienced a slight decrease.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Heavy at the Top and Light at the Bottom - Foreign Stocks Sail Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yue Guang Jumps Over 60%</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the exception of Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton, the other Chinese stocks were generally characterized by being marketable but having no market, and having sellers but no buyers. Although the three hot stocks (Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton) performed well, they lacked support. Short positions were relatively crowded, and there were frequent small-scale short squeezes along the way. However, out-of-favor and veteran stocks experienced declines without increases. Although Wing On Textile reached 5,450 yuan, Mei Ya Silk reached 4,500 yuan, and Jing Fu Cotton reached a high of 470 yuan, prices had retreated by noon. As a result, the three hot stocks (Wing On Textile, Mei Ya Silk, and Jing Fu Cotton) each closed up by about half a percent from the previous day, while out-of-favor stocks remained stable. Veteran stocks saw Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank retreat to around 90,000 yuan, and China Insurance Corporation had a supply of 4,200 shares with no demand. Zhongxing Coal Mine also had a supply of 95,000 shares. Most of the smaller stocks also experienced selling pressure. In the afternoon, pre-market trading was slightly higher, with Wing On Textile at 5,400 yuan, Mei Ya Silk at 4,400 yuan, and Jing Fu Cotton at 455 yuan. For foreign stocks, new longs from banks joined the market, and brokers favored Yue Guang Rubber. Ewo Silk remained the investment target of the general public. British American Tobacco Company was extremely scarce, and its market price had surpassed that of Ewo Silk. Ewo Silk opened in the morning at around 12,000 yuan, gradually rising to 12,700 yuan, and hovered around 12,500 yuan at noon. As a result, each stock closed up by about 10% to 15% from the previous day. China Land &amp; Cultivation experienced a 20% increase due to its cheap base price. Yue Guang Rubber was favored by major players and jumped by 60%. Bidding prices remained upward after the close. The market was initially high and then low in the afternoon, and ultimately remained stable. It was rumored that the Association of Various Industries would hold a meeting in the afternoon to discuss merging with Chinese stocks, and that most of the bullish positions in the securities firms had flowed into the hands of Bank of Communications Xie's new longs.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice market digestion remained sluggish, and supply continued. It was rumored that relief rice from abroad might arrive in Shanghai, which dampened sentiment. Indica rice continued to decline by 1,000 yuan. White rice was readily sold as it arrived, with no significant changes. High-quality black rice was scarce, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. The appetite for wheat flour from Shantou was very strong, and prices rose by 200 yuan. Wheat bran digestion in the interior continued, and prices continued to rise by more than 100 yuan. Soybean cakes were firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan, but only local vendors were taking a slight amount, and transactions were not significant. High-quality raw peanuts were active, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-quality peanuts were sluggish and flat, with a trend of increasing the price of high-quality peanuts and suppressing the price of medium-quality peanuts. Sesame seeds still lacked prosperity. Corn recovered by 500 yuan. Cotton cakes were flat. The oil market saw sporadic arrivals from Dalian, and the selling of affordable oil continued. Vegetable oil and clear oil declined slightly by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Bidding Prices Increase - Yarn Market Shows Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of a turnaround. After the recent sharp declines, buyer interest had already been piqued, and the repeated good news from the gold market boosted sentiment. The prices of various yarn counts rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. 20-count yarn from major brands such as Shuang Ma had exceeded the 1,000,000 threshold. Unfortunately, transactions were still not active. The textile construction company held its regular goods opening yesterday, with a total of 30 types ranging from 1-count yarn to 100-count thread. Most of the bid prices were 10,000 to 20,000 higher than the previous period. According to industry insiders, the textile construction company's bid prices have been gradually declining in recent periods, which has effectively suppressed yarn prices. Although yesterday's price increase was not significant, it provided a considerable boost to sentiment.</p>
<h3>New Biluochun Tea Launched - Opening Price of 900,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Biluochun green tea produced in Dongting Mountain, Suzhou, is of excellent quality and is welcomed by shops and dealers in this city and Tianjin. This year's new goods just arrived in Shanghai yesterday due to weather conditions, with only a hundred or so catties. It was absorbed by the city's major tea houses, with an opening price of 900,000 yuan per dan. It is reported that subsequent batches are still arriving in succession, and the future selling price is expected to remain volatile. As for the new Mingqian Longjing from Hangzhou, arrivals have been abundant, and prices have continued to soften. Currently, the discounted price among the same industry is 1,400,000 yuan per dan. Transactions of aged teas remain sluggish.</p>
<h3>Southeast Tea Loan - Total Amount of 10 Billion Yuan - Managed by the Farmers Bank of China - A Precursor to Developing National Tea Exports</h3>
<p>(Our report) With the tea season approaching, the need for funds is urgent. Dr. Shou Jingwei, Chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, Wu Juenong, Chairman of the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association and Chairman of the Southeast Tea Region Factory Federation, and tea industry leaders Ye Shichang, Wang Zhenhuan, Zheng Jianyuan, and Huang Yantang have successively telegraphed President Song of the Executive Yuan and Governor Bei of the Central Bank, as well as the Four Joint Offices, requesting prompt approval. It is now known that President Song of the Executive Yuan has approved the tea loans for Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces as follows: (A) Qimen District: 1.8 billion, (B) Tunxi District: 2 billion, (C) Pingshui District: 2.2 billion, (D) Ningzhou District: 500 million, (E) Eastern Jiangxi District: 200 million, (F) Wenzhou District: 300 million, totaling 7 billion. The remaining 1 billion for Fujian and 2 billion for Hunan and Hubei are also under review, totaling 10 billion yuan. This loan provides great encouragement for tea export trade and is managed by the Farmers Bank of China. In the future, tea packaging loans related to foreign exchange resources will be primarily managed by the Bank of China. It is also confirmed that this loan is being introduced by the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association, which is responsible for guaranteeing the repayment of loans for factories in the interior. Therefore, it has been decided that the association, together with the Farmers Bank of China and the Southeast Factory Federation, will conduct strict reviews to ensure due diligence.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shou Jingwei, Chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, the summary of the tea loan plan for Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces this year is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Goal: To restore the rural economy after the war and expand the overseas Chinese tea market.</p>

<p>(2) To avoid tea merchants having to travel to the interior to fulfill the guarantee contract and waste time, the business and factory sides jointly estimate the amount according to the production capacity of each factory, list the details in detail, and sign a guarantee agreement with the designated tea loan bank in advance. Then, the local factories in various places shall sign contracts separately with the local branches of the bank in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<p>(3) The loan period for production shall be limited to three months.</p>
<p>(4) This loan must be disbursed in the tea area and must not be used in Shanghai to avoid speculation and other malpractices.</p>

<h3>National Education Budget for Our Country's 35th Year</h3>

<p>At 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park</p>
<p>Today is the last battle of the first division of the football league, Hequn vs. British Navy. If the British Navy wins, it can surpass the Soviet Union and rank fifth. Hequn will not be able to remove the last seat no matter whether it wins or loses. The record of the first division is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today's game will be held at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The records of the two teams are mediocre, and the tickets have now been raised by one time, at 1,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan, so it may not be attractive.

<h3>About Writing Poetry</h3>
<p>— Feng Cunzhao</p>
<p>A newly published poetry magazine on the market is called "Cotton Poetry Island," and its content is all poems and essays on poetry. I will not comment on all the poems in this publication for the time being, but I feel that I have some things to say about young people writing poetry.</p>
<p>There are two points that young people in general need to re-emphasize about poetry: one is the cultivation of poetry, which is also the rhetoric of writing. It should also have all complete words and sentences—for example, to be connected by nouns, real words, verbs, adjectives, and even prepositional words. It should not be the kind of sentence that uses more than three overlapping adjectives without interrogative words.</p>
<p>Beauty is one of the conditions of poetry, but its formation often comes after the completion of the overall organization. If you first select the words and phrases one by one, and then construct the words and sentences one by one as if they were generals, it will definitely become a palette, dazzling but actually empty.</p>
<p>Although poetry is not prose, writing good prose first and then writing poetry can at least avoid the above-mentioned defects.</p>
<h3>Two New Books on Psychology</h3>
<p>— Ji Tongfang</p>
<p>Huang Yi: Child Psychology (Zhengzhong)</p>
<p>Fu Binran: Talks on the Psychology of Learning (Kaiming)</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been quite a few books published on psychology. However, few are suitable for the general public to read and can contribute to improvements in life. Recently, I read two books, one is Huang Yi's "Child Psychology," and the other is Fu Binran's "Talks on the Psychology of Learning." I feel that they are very suitable for general needs. Although these two books cannot be considered academic masterpieces, they are more closely related to our daily lives, so I am introducing them here.</p>
<p>The author of "Child Psychology," Dr. Huang Yi, taught at Zhejiang University for many years and presided over the Zhejiang University "Infant Research Institute." He had great insights into child psychology research. It is said that he fell ill and was isolated inland after the book was published. This is truly a loss to the academic community in our country. After reading Dr. Huang's posthumous work, I believe that it can cover important issues in child psychology in terms of content. Although it is only a small book of less than two hundred pages, it is sufficient to represent an overview of modern scientific child psychology. It can help readers understand the true meaning of modern child psychology and the basic principles that should be adopted in child education. That is why I say it is suitable for general needs.</p>
<p>The book is divided into sixteen chapters. The first chapter explains that child psychology is a science that studies the developmental process of individual behavior and briefly describes the value of studying child psychology. The second chapter describes the historical development of child psychology, allowing us to know how child psychology has progressed to modern scientific research. The third chapter indicates the methods for studying child psychology. The fourth chapter discusses the principles of development, providing a very detailed discussion of heredity and environment, growth and learning, as well as the laws and rates of psychological development, and the situation of individual differences. The fifth chapter points out the general trend of human psychological development from the psychological development stages of the embryonic period, childhood, and adolescence. Chapters one to five form a system that can be called an overview.</p>
<p>From chapter six onwards, important issues in child psychology are discussed. Chapter six, children's games, particularly emphasizes the relationship between games and education, indicating new concepts in education. Chapter seven broadly discusses the development of actions, and separately describes the development of actions in the embryonic period, newborn period, infancy, and early childhood, citing many recent experimental studies. From chapters eight to fourteen, various aspects of children's development are still discussed in detail -- perception, language, intelligence, social behavior, emotions, needs, morality. The development process, differences, changes, and advancements are discussed for each, and necessary training and controls in various aspects of development are also discussed. Chapter fifteen discusses children's mental health issues based on the principles of mental hygiene, and briefly states the mental hygiene principles that should be followed in mental illness and pathological personality, children's daily behavior, and training. The final chapter is an example of child guidance issues, showing practical examples in child education, such as obedience, anger and crying, fear, stuttering, children who use their left hand, intelligence and behavior problems, and physical defects, all proposing effective remedial methods.</p>
<p>There are usually two methods of writing child psychology: one is purely scientific research, which focuses on theoretical discussions, with the purpose of understanding children's behavior and the principles of their development; the other is to apply the principles of psychology to children's education, focusing on the application of practical life, which belongs to technology. These two different writing methods have completely different natures. Huang's book should belong to the application type. Broadly speaking, child psychology includes the entire development from conception to adulthood. Because the book is suitable for the standards of the Ministry of Education's normal school curriculum and can be used as a textbook, it focuses on the period before six or seven years old, also paying considerable attention to elementary school, and briefly mentioning adolescence. I think it would be most appropriate to use this book as a textbook for kindergarten normal schools or normal schools. Housewives can also get more practical knowledge about raising children from this book.</p>
<p>The difference between this book and previous publications on child psychology is that it does not cite too many experimental statistical materials, and focuses on the explanation of principles. Originally, the author believed that the destination of learning is not in cumbersome facts and numbers, but in the meaning and principles of these materials. This attitude is correct for beginners. Also, the viewpoint of this book is close to "Gestalt Theory." Concepts such as "alternate reflection," "intuition," "chatting," and "reflex arc" are naturally not adopted. First, we should pay attention to clear concepts in order to grasp the thought of the whole book. For beginners, compiling child psychology should avoid difficult theories and academic disputes, but a unified point of view should not be lacking. Therefore, the author adopted the developmental theory that he considered the most consistent with the facts, and took the Gestalt theory as the center of thought.</p>
<p>I think the strength of this book is that it is concise and the views are correct. However, there are still many issues, such as thought, concepts, worldview, continuation, and artistic activities, which cannot be avoided from the scope of discussion due to the limitations of space. I think this is a regret.</p>
<p>In recent years, psychological knowledge has been increasingly applied to practical life. The development of applied psychology is the happiness of mankind's future. The most widely used psychology is, of course, various activities in education, and the name of learning psychology is often put together with educational psychology. It is actually the most important part of educational psychology. Ordinary educational psychology mostly discusses learning psychology, and books that specifically explore psychology describe the learning psychology problem in more detail, what learning laws, learning transfer, learning environment, and the effective principles of learning are described in each part. However, the general defect of this type of book is that it is biased towards the enumeration of theories, with few citations of facts, and it is written very rigidly, almost making people feel that it is all mechanical articles, and it does not seem to be entirely related to our lives (learning activities are also one of our lives).</p>
<p>The recently published "Talks on the Psychology of Learning" by Kaiming does not have this defect. The author of this book, Mr. Fu Binran, wrote several important issues in learning psychology, tailored to the needs of real life, into independent topics, which were published in installments in the "Middle School Student Magazine." This book is a collection of these articles. Because those articles were able to grasp the central issues to be discussed in learning psychology, they had a large number of readers inland after they were published. Although this collection is composed of independent topics, unlike the usual learning psychology, which is divided into chapters, from introduction to main body, from the narration of general concepts to the discussion of special problems, those single articles have an invisible connection. The only fascinating thing about this book is that it does not adopt the narrative of general textbooks, but uses light brushstrokes and vivid examples to apply the various basic principles of learning psychology to real learning activities.</p>
<p>Learning cannot be separated from life. Combining various explanations of learning, we should compare and verify our usual learning activities with these theories. The article "What Do We Learn from Reading the Books of Sages?" uses Song Qiao's words as an introduction to explain what we have learned in our daily learning, and what are the differences between the acquisition of habits and skills, the learning of knowledge, and the learning of appreciation and ideals. Regarding the issue of heredity and environment, there is appropriate insight in "Planting Melons Gets Melons, Planting Beans Gets Beans." As for which is more important, it can be seen from several points summarized by the author. "Second, what heredity gives us is only various specific abilities, not specific content. The second point is that hereditary ability is only a possible tendency, that is, a starting point for plasticity. The third point is that humans are the most plastic organisms, and whether the hereditary ability can be fully developed depends on the social environment." "The Most Intelligent and the Most Stupid" concludes the relationship between intelligence and learning. In the normal distribution, the absolute majority is of medium intelligence. Personal achievement still depends on one's own efforts. Even if one has extraordinary talent, it can only be developed and expressed in a good social environment and education, and a good environment and education can still be learned through one's own struggle. "From Conscience Money to Character" uses the conscience money donated by the citizens of Guilin during the Anti-Japanese War for the honor soldiers who went to the front line to explain the social and psychological meaning of morality, and to explain that character is composed of behavior, and can in turn affect behavior and determine behavior.</p>
<p>In recent years, the mental hygiene movement has been attracting much attention. Educators unanimously agree that only by applying the principles of mental hygiene can human life be improved and social culture promoted. The author, in "Sour Grapes Sweet Lemon Philosophy," explains abnormal psychological phenomena from adaptation and motivation based on these principles, analyzes various bad adaptation methods that can affect mental health one by one, and suggests several key points on mental hygiene methods. "Starting from the Worship of Four Books and Five Classics and Latin," the author gives an objective criticism of the psychological principles of "Fachly Psychology," "Erulcation as Formal Discipline," and "The Translerssof Learning," and believes that formal training is unreliable. He also narrates the application of the theory of learning transfer in learning: "First, we should pay attention to the materials we learn have direct practical effects. Secondly, our learning life should pay attention to integrating with actual life and pay attention to the principle of learning from doing. Thirdly, the method of learning and the method of guidance have a very significant impact on learning." After explaining several common phenomena in learning, the author's "Talks on the Learning Curve" mainly wants us to avoid unnecessary self-satisfaction, self-admiration, self-pity, and self-deprecating in the uneven learning environment, and to arouse learning enthusiasm and interest to improve learning efficiency. Memory and forgetting are often discussed in learning psychology. The author uses the topic "A Bad Memory Is Worse Than a Rotten Pen" to study this problem. The author suggests to us that memory is certainly important, but memorizing by rote is not the way. It is better to guide students to "think" more than to instruct them to "remember" more. In recent years, psychologists have said a lot about the experiments on the learning ability of adults. The results all prove that the learning ability of adults is not weak. The author selected the topic "If You Don't Work Hard When You Are Young, You Will Be Sad When You Are Old" to illustrate the importance of adult education and the reasons why it is ignored, and to encourage everyone to pay attention to the advancement of adult education. "The Psychology of Reading" tells us how to improve the understanding ability of reading, which is to apply scientific methods to reading. The last article "Two Stories" cites the stories of Lu Chunyang preaching and selling stinky tofu to discuss that both "learning methodists" and "learning theorists" have their reasons. However, the author compromises these two concepts: "We think that the learning itself is of course fundamental. Without learning, there is no method. However, the method of learning should also be valued. The method of learning is the experience gained by predecessors from hard work. This experience is enough for us to take many detours and enough for us to increase learning efficiency."</p>
<p>In terms of the content of this book, although it is a collection of individual articles, there is a clear system that can be found from beginning to end. From the first article to the last article, it can form an organization by itself. I think this method of writing has the advantages of textbooks (clear system) without the defects of textbooks (rigid compilation). The principles of educational psychology are placed in a "fun" narrative, and reading it will naturally not feel boring.</p>
