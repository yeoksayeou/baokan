<h3>馬帥與司徒大使　決續為我和平努力　政府對現局及安平事件將作表示　宋院長美大使等今返京</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕馬歇爾特使五日上午十時半往訪司徒大使，長談兩小時，馬特使夫婦五日晚七時半約蔣主席夫婦，宋子文院長及其女公子在行館晚餐後，並同觀好萊塢電影。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕馬歇爾約星期三四返京，渠與司徒大使均表示，三數日仍將來牯。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕據可靠方面消息，馬歇爾元帥及司徒大使對安平事件，自其發生之日起，始終以鎭定而公允之態度處之，並曾據華北美軍方面及各方報吿，彙擬報吿，呈報華盛頓當局，日內即可有訓令到達，馬特使及司徒大使預定抵京後根據該項訓令，發表一聲明。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺五日電〕美陸戰隊在平津公路之安平被共產黨伏擊，死傷多人，迄今僅從共產黨方面獲得「遺憾」二字。聞馬帥與司徒大使不僅不因此而自爲奔走中國和平之艱鉅歷程宣吿退却，且將賡續安平事件以前商談之脆弱基礎，不惜再經無數次努力，以底於成。馬帥仍留牯，大使六日飛京，即爲謀此崇高理想之實現。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕司徒雷登大使，五日午後五時晋謁蔣主席，傅涇波氏隨往，此為大使二次登山後之第二次晋見蔣主席，談至六時廿分始出，對安平事件及中國和平前途，均經涉及，大使定六日上午下山返京。據傅涇波氏吿記者，大使在京留數日，將再來牯。</p>
<p>〔本報枯嶺五日電〕蔣主席五日午間在行轅召見宋子文院長作長談，然後與夫人·宋氏及宋之女公子共進午餐。宋院長定六日返京。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，定六日偕貝爾顧問返京。原定七日在牯招待新聞記者，宣示政府對當前局勢及安平事件之嚴正態度一舉，將改在南京舉行。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺五日電〕此間外籍權威方面接獲華府消息，美輿論對中共在平津公路安平伏擊美陸戰隊事件之一搬反應，威脅白宮即行撤退其駐華美軍，實屬一種最笨拙之錯誤。牯嶺人士意見則認爲，安平事件象徵中共對中國和平與遠東和平的威脅，最直接受其挫折者，爲杜魯門總統對華聲明，馬歇爾將軍駐華的使命，司徒雷登大使的見義勇爲，與七月來國民政府爭取和平的努力，惟中美兩國政府對安平事件須避免感情激動，須放棄綏靖主義，仍須繼續爭取其和平政策，一面戒備國際海盜式的暴行，一面引導中共的非法活動走入合法途徑，務使中共欲全面叛亂旣不可圖，自外於國家亦不可能。</p>
<h3>柯克上將飛靑島　昨離滬前詳述安平事件謂事實眞相繼續調查中</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島五日電〕柯克上將偕夫人公子，五日下午五時半由滬飛抵靑。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美駐華艦隊總司令柯克上將，昨午後離滬飛靑島，行前在華懋飯店招待本市中外各報記者，報吿「安平事件」，認爲共黨新聞機關一再指責「美海軍陸戰隊攻擊共軍第五十三團」，適足以反證出此一事件責任者之爲誰。柯克上將於報吿之初，首先指出，美軍在華使命，係協助恢復中國之和平狀態。由於此種目的，美海軍陸戰隊在平津間保持經常交通，每二週一次，職送給養至北平軍調部及該地美軍。</p>
<p>「循此公路綫之若干地區」，柯克宣稱：「向有共軍存在，此次美軍給養護運隊之被襲擊，即係在通過該地段時發生」。</p>
<p>根據柯克上將對安平事件之詳盡報吿，該護運隊之主體百二噸半重滿載軍械食物之卡車十二輛，行總卡車一輛，美軍長官三人另坐一輛，由一先行車隊前導，該先行隊係吉普二乘，一噸斥堠車二輛所組成，俱帶有自動步槍與機關槍。上月廿九日正午十二時二十分先行車隊行抵安平附近，見公路上有牛車兩乘阻塞其間，美軍當即下車探視該項障礙物，即於此時、突然飛來手溜彈一枚，繼又　來五六枚，美軍長官指揮護運隊之柯溫上校立被炸斃，海軍陸戰隊死一人，傷十二人，入晚復有一人因傷重不治殞命。</p>
<p>在手溜彈爆炸之同時，公路兩側即有步槍向美軍連續射擊，距公路約三百碼處村落中並有機關槍，雙方激戰達四小時之久，村落中即有白旗出現，美軍即派三人上前調査，詎其中又有一人被擊斃，幸不久攻擊者終於停止射擊而去。</p>
<p>據柯克上將估計，攻擊部隊約有三百餘人，其中大部穿灰色共軍軍服，戴日軍遺下之軍帽，若有　至少有三人已被擊斃，傷者當不止此數。</p>
<p>嗣即由各記者紛紛發問，根據柯克上將之答詞，大致可歸納如下：（一）目前美海軍陸戰隊仍往來平津於間公路上，護運其糧食與給養，（二）安平事件之事實眞相，現仍在繼續調査中，唯並未向延安方面提抗議。（三）除東北外，日僑俘殆已遣送完畢。（四）在華美陸戰隊總數在二萬二三千之間，對是否如外間盛傳即將撤退一節，則並未論述。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕柯克上將稱：美軍在安平被襲事件，係由馬歇爾特使處理。渠並鄭重表示，若將來再有此種事件發生，美軍爲自衛計，仍將還擊。又稱：美軍並不因此改變其一貫立塲。美艦到靑者共有十六艘，已有八艘移交中國海軍。</p>

<h3>天津美軍又遭襲擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社天津五日電〕今日侵晨，有美軍官一人駕車回返東營房，經過鐵橋時，遭人開槍襲擊，美陸戰隊據報前往調査，在歸途遭埋伏襲擊，發槍多響，美陸戰隊即謀掩護，故無死傷。</p>
<p>〔又電〕今日侵晨天津東區方面傳來機關槍聲，衆料當在北寗鐵路以外。</p>
<h3>安平事件發生後　國軍已進駐香河　當地共軍變更番號竄</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕香河城內共軍，於大小沙河不幸事件後，預知該城勢必由國軍進駐，乃於三日午全軍撤出，政工人員同時撒退，所徵糧秣，則均運往平谷，國軍隨後入城，此後平津公路將因此而獲相當保障。據悉：平津公路上七月份曾有商營及公路總局汽車七輛被共軍扣留，並聲言凡載小麥或携法幣十萬元以上，均予沒收。又共軍冀熱遼軍區司令蕭克，就大小沙河事件經過軍調部共方向美方提出抗議，謂係美軍攻擊共軍，並提附件，列舉四項，謂二三兩月美軍曾三次派武裝美兵赴香河，與共軍商修平津公路，三月廿九日有武裝美軍六人在平津公路尖村射殺共軍十八軍分區參謀尹士忠，四月一日武裝美軍五人射擊香河馬頭鎭南之共軍陣地。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕交通界息：共軍千餘人，昨晚十時襲擊平津鐵路之楊村車站，激戰三小時退去。又香河共軍雖撤，楊村，武淸等地則新由冀中開來共軍三千餘人，據報其目的在對抗國軍，欲確保平津交通計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報天津四日電〕各方咸信，平津公路上共軍襲擊美軍事，具有複雜內幕，聞美軍方面對此事件尚未認爲完了。據悉：出事地點之大小沙河，共軍曾於廿五召開反美運動大會，其後四日即發生事件，途事共軍爲第十四團，茲已改各特務營，並已離香河境他竄。</p>
<h3>周至柔昨抵牯嶺　對派機飛延安事向主席報告　並出示照片向記者說明事實</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕空軍總司令周至柔將軍，於今日午後六時抵達牯嶺，住中路九十四號仙岩飯店六十五號，旋於六時卅分接見京·滬·漢·潯各報在牯記者，對空軍曾派飛機赴延安炸毀被扣飛機事，加以證實。周氏來牯，將就此事向蔣主席有所報吿。氏原擬勾留數日，但以南京事忙，諸待主持，一二日內即將下山返京。周氏携有炸毀該機後在延安機塲上空二有公尺所拍照片之放大版，於今晚請彭學沛部長在仙岩飯店出示各記者，說明此一事實，該照片極爲淸晰，延安之備有八百公尺跑道之機塲，係在一荒野之小山谷中，而被扣飛機之停留地，距機塲猶達二百公尺。彭氏稱：此次政府派飛機前往延安之唯一目的，厥在炸毀該被扣之飛機，故除該機外，並未造成任何損失及傷害，而毀減該機之動機，實係爲和平前途，因共產黨在日本投降後，曾不斷濫用接收自敵偽之武器，蹂躪人民故也。在牯之中外人士，均經同意此點，咸認此種行動乃正常者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕對於「延安被炸」一事，共產黨將藉此大事煊染，頃正由周恩來草擬所謂「抗議畫」，現尚未擬就，至其遞交方式亦未悉。</p>

<h3>蘇魯皖共軍攻勢挫潰　各縣國軍進展中　軍事負責人述最近態勢</h3>
<p>〔七報南京五日電〕頃因蘇魯皖國共軍事衝突激烈，因欲明實況，特走訪某軍事負責人，為述該地最近戰爭態勢，茲詳誌如次：</p>
<p>右翼國軍兩路北進</p>
<p>蘇北右翼國軍，於二日黃昏克復海安後，現分兩路向北推進，一路越西陽直逼李堡，一路越王家莊指向富安，將配合溱潼國軍，直搗東台。共軍主力新一師退向安豐梁垜一帶，岡阻擊由海安北上之國軍，共軍第六師，及第七縱隊劉培善部五十五，五十七，六十一三個團，全部撤向莫家莊時　一帶，國軍正在掃蕩中。泰縣國軍沿水路越港口鄒莊，經敷度激戰後，卒將共軍據點老閣克復，該地距泰縣七十二里，離鄒莊十八里，西可攻三垜二溝一溝，威脅高郵，東可配合沈家　國軍，直取東台極具軍事上之價值。</p>
<p>東台興化旦夕可下</p>
<p>傳國軍先頭部隊於肅清老閣附近共軍後，一路向北挺進，攻入興化門戶之十里亭（距興化十里），一路指向西北控制三郎廟，一路麾兵西進，掌握大垜莊橫港，故興化東台兩地共軍，已在國軍圍困之中，旦夕可下。南通至如　公路暢通無阻，如　至泰縣公路，在日夜搶修中。揚州至儀徵公路，因被共軍澈底破壞，故通車尚須稍待時日。淮陰共軍總部圖謀挽救南部危局，已侖新四軍副軍長張雲逸，率部沿運河南下，直達邵伯，向仙女廟反攻，一部於汜水登陸，沿公路開往興化東台增援，預料東台南面不日將展開空前大戰。</p>
<p>揚州國軍乘勢追擊</p>
<p>揚州國軍沿揚天公路推進，三日晨克復楊獸壩孫公舖後，乘勢向西北追擊，四日克復大儀集，秦欄已在國軍控制中，揚天公路通車，僅爲時間問題。共軍甘泉部隊刻於公道橋送駕橋一帶集結，一律更換便衣，企圖偸襲揚州。至大儀集一帶國軍，蘇北左翼國軍克盱眙天長後，已進抵高郵及洪澤湖河道，一部越河進入蔣壩，沿洪澤湖大堤指向順河集，將配合宿遷南下國軍，夾擊泗陽。由宿遷北上國軍，越張莊抵達邵店與共軍隔沭河對峙，將與新安南下國軍會師，然後合攻沭陽，使沭河以西隴海綫以南津浦路以東宿遷睢寗以北之共軍，陷於孤立。</p>
<p>魯南共軍企圖增援</p>
<p>徐州國軍於擊潰共軍八個團之兵力後，向東南推進，開始肅淸隴海綫以南，集結於雙溝附近之共軍。魯省共軍自費縣臨沂　縣，調集援軍萬餘人，沿棗莊支綫，經台兒莊運河車站，向沭陽進展，企圖配合灌雲共軍，圍攻東海新安，保持蘇魯交通，國軍爲粉碎共軍此項企圖，已由徐州徵調重兵，向台兒荘進，切斷蘇魯交界處之運河公路，使魯省南下共軍，阻於台兒莊以北，不敢越雷池一步，共軍刻已竄往車西山桃花橋一帶，仍圖偸渡運河，竄越隴海綫，向蘇北增援。</p>
<p>碭山戰機一觸即發</p>
<p>又徐州迤西之碭山國軍，面臨共軍主力，戰機一觸即發，局勢已　空前緊張階段，魯西濟寗，嘉祥，鉅野，鄲城，荷澤各縣共軍，頃正越金咻，定　，城武，向單縣集結，將配合　縣曹縣共軍，以及隴海綫以南豫境永城之共軍，四面夾擊碭山，夏邑已展開熾烈之爭奪戰，現雲集於碭山附近之共軍，不下二萬餘人，內有楊永部八個團，以及宋仁窮部萬餘人。</p>
<h3>李聞案定今公佈　昆謠傳楊立德已病故</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明四日電〕李聞案全部經過六日公佈。（一）此間謠傳楊立德已病故，尚未獲證實。（二）滇垣黨政軍敎高級人員四日晚在省府曾舉行座談會。</p>
<h3>東北共軍　運魯增援</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕軍息：安東·鳳城·岫嚴·莊河·蓋平一帶共軍遼東軍區司令蕭華所屬兩個旅，近奉令集中莊河東北約六十華里之靑帮子附近，分批由莊河及莊河西南之祉園口兩地乘帆船運往煙臺，運日賡續不絕，似向魯境增援模樣。</p>

<h3>提倡國貨之新意義</h3>
<p>在舶來品充斥於上海市場的今日，本報與各大廠商四十餘家合作舉行的國貨宣傳大游行及提倡國貨運動，恰於此際展開，其意義自至深長。服用國貨，原是國民的天職，此不僅足以阻塞每年數字驚人的入超，抑且足以扶助我幼稚工業的發展。我們之有提倡國貨運動，也不自今日始，但我們今日之提倡國貨，在事實上由感迫切。由於國內局勢的不靖，國外商品的湧入，中國的國貨生產事業正遭逢着空前的危難。今日我們之提倡國貨，不特喚醒我們要有服用國貨的習慣，而且更在喚醒我們要注意到我國當前的危難，想法去解除這些危難，使我們的幼稚工業得以健康地發展下去，換句話說，今日我們之提倡國貨，其目的不完全在推廣國貨的消費，而更在提高國貨的生產。</p>
<p>要提高我們國貨的生產，在消極方面言，必須排除種種足以阻碍提高國貨生產的因素；在積極方面言，我們必須造成種種使國貨生產得以提高的有利條件。在障碍重重國貨生產處於極不利的條件下，國貨生產事業的萎縮不振，可能使我們整個幼稚的民族工業趨於滅亡。到那個時候，我們再來提倡國貨，恐怕已經晚了。所以我們今日來提倡國貨，特別要位國貨生產事業造成優良健康的環境，使其得以滋長發育。</p>
<p>的確，橫置在當今國貨生產事業之前的種種障碍，主要是與中國整個民族的生存是不可分的。共黨的割據作亂，使國內的交通迄未暢復，影響於商貨的流通；地方的不靖，又使國貨的消費降低。此外，幣值的未能穩定，洋貨的大量傾銷，都使國貨生產事業面臨着嚴重的難關。這些危難之解除必求之於大局的澄清，必整個中國的大局能夠開朗，能夠安定，然後中國的國貨生產事業纔能夠開朗，能夠安定。所以當我們籲請解除國貨生產事業危難的時候，第一使我們想到的就是共黨　兵問題。因為共黨的作梗，所以交通未復，還沒有達到統一的局面；以致政府迄未能着手根本解除當前的經濟危難，如幣制的整理等等，使國內的經濟生活得以漸趨於安定。對於這些解除目前經濟危難的治本之道政府之未能有何積極的舉措，我們是可以諒解的。</p>
<p>但諒解政府對解除當前經濟危難治本方面的未能有何積極舉措，並不在解脫政府應負的責任。當前的若干危難，固與整個大局有關；但若干危難却在表示政府的沒有堅定政策，由於政府的舉措不當。屬於後者的，我們看見充斥國內市場的輸入品，特別是奢侈消費品，正足以表示政府沒有保護本國工業的政策，致使價廉物美的舶來品充斥於市。今天我們之提倡國貨，第一要請求政府明定保護本國工業的政策而善為運用。這在目前，為保護我們幼稚的工業，對於我們的國際貿易决不可完全放任其自由，應採嚴格的管制。政府對於若干奢侈品的輸入，經已運用關稅政策加以禁止，但若干非必需而又未列為奢侈品的商品，如今却大量湧入，即加上關稅運費，亦較本國生產之商品成本為低。在此種情形之下，國貨工業安得不窒息以死？由於國內生產成本的過高，對於此項輸入商品的取締，已不能完全運用關稅政策。在從價徵稅的情形下，因為貨價的本身低，即加上高額含有取締意義的進口稅，亦較本國商品為廉，致未能收取締之實效。我們不能讓這種局勢長此自然發展下去。</p>
<p>其次，使我國生產界感到困難的是銀行拆息的過高，使它們無法喘氣過來。生產事業的經營，自原料的購進以至製成品的賣出，起間在在需要流動資金的周轉。在目前拆息在一角乃至二角以上的情形下，生產事業怎能不感到萎縮？在扶植我國貨生產事業上，我們希望政府對於高利貸能夠為有效的取締，使它們能夠以較低的利率為必要的資金借貸，使生產事業能夠漸趨活潑起來。</p>
<p>凡上所言，若高利貸的取締，對於輸入貿易的管制，原為政府應為之事。在目前國內局勢尚未澄清的階段下，如欲對當前的經濟危難，正本清源，為澈底的改進，容或勢所不許，但治標方面的舉措，實在不容拖延。為國貨生產事業留一分元氣，即為民族經濟留一分活力。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕關於多數表決問題，澳外長伊瓦特對英國所提之折衷方案，已表示反對。伊氏吿本社記者，謂此舉無異給予四强以否決權，換言之，即未得四强同意之議案，不能由大會接受，此爲主要之否決權，尚有因三分之二多數規定而產生之另一否決權，即如有七國或八國之聯合一致，即可阻止大會之修正和約草案，此誠要不得之至云。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕巴黎會議即將進入第二週，「多數表決」問題仍俏進入具體討論之障碍。廿一國出面邀請五前敵國列席陳述意見之請柬，亦可於下週發出，五國代表均已在巴黎，惟首要代表則仍在本國等候正式請柬。阿爾巴尼亞·埃及·慮森堡·墨西哥·古巴等國亦要求參加和會，是否得如願以償，尚不可知。大部份和會代表認爲阿爾巴尼亞等五國不妨准其出席一述意見，但不得爲和會之正式會員國，有認輿國亦應列席，以陳述奧義邊疆之意見者。和約內容可發生之爭執，有特港及義　領問題等。南斯拉夫·烏古蘭及白俄羅斯之代表在大會中已有此暗示。關於義艦隊之分配，四强海軍專家猶無最後協議，被等已將義艦別爲A·B·C三級，但如何分配給英美蘇三强，則猶不能解決。蘇聯建議用抽籤辦法，爲英國所反對，預料此事當送回外長會議討論。</p>
<h3>小國代表紛紛責難　貝爾納斯提申辯　列舉和約草案未同意各點謂各國均有提出建議機會</h3>
<p>〔衆社巴黎四日電〕若干代表曾指責巴黎和會爲具文式之會議，美國務卿貝爾納斯今夜在簡短之新聞會議中，對此點有所聲辯，並列舉和約草案中四强未能同意之廿六項問題，須待和會加以決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕權威方面息：貝爾納斯表示十七國小國對於四强外長未曾解決之卅二項問題，均能有提出建議之機會，其中主要者如（一）義南國界之確定及特港問題，（二）特港政權之地位，（三）義對蘇聯以外國家之賠款，（四）多瑙河自由通航問題，（五）保加利亞條約中之疆界問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎四日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯頃向本社記者談稱，和會在第一星期中，已獲有進步，實超過吾人所期望者，尤其是規程委員會獲得重大成就，各國代表均曾公開發表意見，此次和會之主要目標，乃在使各國代表儘量發表其意見，故余認爲四强應使其他十七國優先發表其對於和約草案之意見，因其未參加和約起草工作，如此始可謂平等。余欲使處森堡宮成爲一公開論壇，凡屬參戰各國，均能在此發表意見，余不願世人謂此次和會爲另一四强會議，而應爲廿一國會議，甚至謂十七國會議，余亦表示欣慰。凡經和會以三分二之多數所通過之一切建議，美國均以全力支持，務使其實施，余要求起草和約之五種委員會之主席，慼由四强以外之其他國家代表充任，其故亦即在此。要之，吾人對於中小國家，不論何時均應予以便利，有人對於以小組委會代替全體大會討論和約，認爲意義重大，實屬錯誤。良以和會所採取之最後建議，必須經全體大會通過故也。</p>

<h3>古巴要求參加和會</h3>
<p>〔衆社巴黎四日電〕本日此間據悉，古巴已正式要求四强准予參加廿一國和會，古巴公使阿雅拉將古巴外長阿爾瓦勒斯簽署之照會一件，遞交四强代表，內稱，古巴曾對軸心國宣戰，並曾簽署聯合國宜言，故應准予參加會議。按古巴爲拉丁美洲國家中第二個要求參加和會之國家，墨西哥曾於和會召開前提出該項要求，惟尚未有所決定。</p>

<p>九月廿三抵瀋時瀋陽市已完全爲日軍所占，並由土肥原出任「代理瀋陽市長」。往晤土肥原時，見日軍本部前堆積鐵路破壞物，頗爲觸目。土肥原說明此等鐵路破壞物乃柳條滿鐵路被炸毀時物，並出示該處照片，見該處業經淸掃，破壞地點已另易新鐵軌，忱木兩根亦已更換，仔細察看，並無證據可蕁。離炸毀處鐵軌五十米至百米處，有中國兵屍體三其，彼等據稱係炸毀鐵路而企岡逃逸者，但屍身上並無血漬。在瀋時曾購得一羣日人身着普通服製，佩帶臂章，持槍而立之照片其多。臂章上審「在鄉軍人」，即預備兵之意。據美領事館員及外人談稱：</p>
<p>事變前數日即有多人佩帶此種臂章，美孚火油公司遠東副經理曾將日兵營及似屬倉庫之房屋指示與余，並謂屋內置有重砲及重砲彈，此等軍火係　稱開礦機機器而　入者。·時記者發出電報時，須提出記者證，初時並不受妨碍，其後稍受限制，並遭憲兵監視。日人在東北之暴行，雖未曾目睹，然時有報道，其中一則曾刋載於密勒氏評論報，乃日人於東北某村，藉口該村藏匿俄國遊擊隊，殺害三千人之多。該處因爲日軍所估，未能前往調査，但據中國人及外國牧師所言，確有其事。鮑氏繼即述及。</p>

<h3>參觀諾城TVA　訪大文豪馬克叶溫故居（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>我去田納西州途中，可惜沒有碰上這樣的經騐，像一般一樣，白人的列車中，是安靜而有秩序的。車子進入肯塔基州，漸漸進入山岳地帶，因爲有很多向上的山坡，行車的速度，非常緩慢。從肯塔基到田納西，我對於這一路的影象，覺得和中國的西南山岳地帶無殊。肯塔基·田納西·北加羅里那·南加羅里那等州，正猶如我們的雲南·四川·貴州·西康一樣；不過，他們在東南，我們在西南罷了。南方鐵道公司肯塔基田納西一段，仿佛我們的黔桂路·滇越路，也像北殕附近的北川鐵路。火車爬在山坡上，在山凹間灣着前進，像荷了重負的行路苦力。大概當年建築的時候，是遷就山岳，少打洞子，因此不像瑞士山國鐵道那樣大半　隧道橋樑築成。從肯塔進田納西，我有見了三個大山洞，兩個小山洞，大山洞也不二分鐘就完了。火車每穿過一次山洞，車窗上都　凝滿水沬一樣的氣體，我不知道，這種氣體，是不是中國西南山地的所謂「瘴癘之氣」？越向南走，氣候也愈熱，我在田納西州中部的一個小城「奧克地」二度換車，折向東走，再國二小時，到達諾克斯微爾城，這是田納西水利工程的總樞紐，「TVA」首腦部·</p>
<p>諾克斯微爾是一座典型的美國小城，TVA與工以前，居民僅及一萬人左右，現在諾克斯微爾的人口統計，已經超出十五萬人。許多退伍下來的海陸軍官兵，他們要求平時職業，政府都把他們介紹到TVA來。全美國的企業，大部份都屬於民營，國營事業極少極少。TVA是美國龐大國營事業的一個創舉，因此逐成爲戰徒政府安置退伍軍人的最好地方。TVA的總辦公廳隔壁，便是退伍軍人登記處。田納西四　皆山，諾克斯微爾是山窪間的一塊小平地，像四川的銅梁合川一樣。田納西的省會在奈希維爾，田納西州的州立大學部在諾克斯微爾。州立大學以農學著稱，TVA的三個指導委員之一：哈考脫·茅根，便是前任的田納西大學校長，美國有名的農業專家。中國學生很少在美國南方求學，田納西大學註册組的鄧福特先生吿訴我：很久以前，曾經有中國留學生在道兒念書，現在有一位女生，還有一位姓張的男生，在田納西大學肄業。張君在TVA方面工作，專門學習TVA的水利工程。華僑遍佈全美，諾克斯微爾也無例外，廣東開平人勞喬治，在這兒開有一家很大的洗衣作，並且雇用很多美國人工作。</p>
<p>全諾城的華僑約有十位左右，有一位還開設了一家專賣西文書的書店。但是，無論如何，這兒的美國人，對中國舉竟還是生疏的。我走在諾城僅有的四五條大街上，常常爲許多陌生的眼睛注視着。美國的南方，比較保守，他們對海外的常識，不像北方那樣「見多識廣」。還有，美國南方人講話，儘是「士音」，同樣是英語，但比較不容易聽。我到諾城的第二天，碰見諾城「新聞瞭望報」的女記者福斯脫女士，她問我：「到田納西來，是不是覺得南方話難懂」？我說是的。她說：「就是美國人，他們從支加哥紐約來，常常因爲言語繩誤，鬧許多笑話，何况，你不是美國人」！報館對中國建築揚子江水利工程的計劃，感覺興趣。諾城「新聞瞭望報」，把我的來到諾城，刋出了新聞和談話、並且還刋登了我的照相·比我前一天到達的，一位比利時最高法院的法官柏希先生，也奉派來考察TVA，報館要他照相，他說：「此利時的法律：法官的照相，不准公開露面的」。第二天，報館就拿他那句話，作爲了新聞的標題。諾城有兩張大報，</p>
<p>新聞瞭望報是其中之一，另外一張是「諾城紀事報」。「新聞瞭望報」是霍華德系的重要地方報之一，原先是「新聞報」和「瞭望報」分開成兩張的，「瞭望報」早在一八八六年即創刊，至今已有六十年出版的歷史，「新聞報」的歷史比較短，一九四一年，兩報正式合併。現在全館的職員是一七五人，編輯和採訪部約三十人，我會見他們的總編輯密勒先生，和攝影記者安德遜先生。另外一張是「諾城紀事報」，封面上標揭着：「田納西流域最大的報紙」，他是以照片多見長的，社論每天有一大版，社論版上，每天標有不同的「嘉言古訓」，有許多是聖經上摘下來的。我因爲時間十分匆促，還沒有去參觀紀事報。美國的南方，一到夏天，天氣熱得令人喘不過氣來，我住在靠近TVA總管理處附近的一家「公園旅館」內。</p>
<p>TVA新聞部負責接待我的蕭拂爾先生，第一名問我：「旅館房間內有沒有電扇」？TVA幾乎每天有新到的各國嘉賓來參觀，因之，他的「新聞部」（或稱諮詢部，宜傳部，都可）的組織機構是龐大的，每逢一個參觀或者考察人員來，他們便要準備各種資料，安排參觀的日程及節目，他們做這些工作，是有經驗，而且有條不紊的。我在TVA住了十天，從第一天會見新聞部副主任亨理先生起，每天像中學生上課一樣，時間被安排得一絲不漏。什麽時候去堤閘？什麽時候看電影？（有關TVA的電影），甚至還有什慶時候，進圖書館看參書，都被安排得非常緊漢。十天工夫不是來「遊山玩水」式的考察，簡直是「受訓」！但無諭如何，這種受訓生活是可愛的，比利時的法官柏希光生，是我同期「受訓」的唯一同窗，他常常笑着跟TVA的職員們開玩笑：「够瞧的，好厲害的TVA」！（七月十二日諾城航訊）—完—漢泥畈城馬克吐溫故居</p>

<h3>警備部破獲制造偽鈔機關　抄出偽鈔數十億元　蘇滬等三地共獲十人　南翔雙方開槍格鬥　印版雕刻出自名家之手</h3>
<p>上月杪，警備司令部稽查處組長馮仲達及副組長盛昌富，於無意中發現偽造中央銀行民國卅四年版二千元鈔票一種，卽經着手偵查，確定機關分設於蘇州南翔及上海三地，盛氏因於七月廿八日上午，率員赴蘇，經三日之偵査，探悉偽鈔制造機關之所在地點，卽於卅日返滬請示，商量結果，卽於本月三日，由馮組長及盛副組長親率幹員十餘，由馮負責蘇州方面逮捕工作，盛則擔任南翔方面工作，幷另派幹員，在滬守候蘇州及南翔兩地音信。馮於三日赴蘇，下軍後，卽採取行動，於半小時內，將在蘇主犯六名逮捕，同時南翔方面同日亦已逮獲主犯兩名。馮於蘇州方面工作完畢後，急電在滬人員，指示搜査本市方面偽鈔機關之機密，並卽率員來滬。而上海之機關因而亦即破獲，捕獲主犯兩人。當將三處拘獲之要犯十名，押解警備郃法辦。惟南翔方面尚有從犯數人在逃，頃正嚴緝中。昨據馮組長語記者，爲鈔擾亂金融，爲害至烈，今在短短卅六小時內破獲全案，誠堪告慰。此次該部人員努力結果，在三地獲僞鈔一百數十萬元，抄得大批印版及機件。僞鈔印就後，業已於京滬區常州及南翔等地使用，總數在三千數百萬元，其尚未印就之僞鈔，高達五尺，共計印僞鈔數十萬萬之鉅，昨日倘不能將此案破獲，則此項鈔票即將印就混入市塲矣。至此項僞鈔印版之雕刻工作，係出諸全國第一流雕刻名家之手，（此人名字今日可望發表）戰前本市各銀行之禮券及淪陷期間偽中儲券之印版，悉出此人之手，故此項偽鈔之印刷，僅鈔票之號碼及總裁之印章，略爲模糊（非出此人之手），其餘印刷，幾可亂　，極不易認辨。僞鈔之印刷，共分爲四版，頃已全部抄獲。僞鈔機關內部組織，分爲（一）印製，（二）販賣，（三）使用。至此項在京滬地區已使用之僞鈔三千餘萬，決設法追返云。又該僞鈔製造機關，除印製民國卅四年版之中央銀行二千元僞鈔外，幷正試騐五十元關金券之套色問題，亦經破獲，故此項僞鈔機關若遲於一月後始破獲，則全國金融界所受之影響，自無待言。</p>
<p>破案詳情</p>
<p>〔另訊〕淞滬警備司令部稽査處，本月四日在南翔破獲大規模印製中央銀行假鈔機關一案，茲將全部眞相探誌如下：隊月來京滬一帶發現中央銀行二千元假鈔，層見疊出，難辨眞僞，警備部於上月份起即出動大批人員，分赴蘇杭各地偵査，月前該部接得密報，當由陶處長秉承宣司令指示令飭組長馮仲達（前偵防大隊大隊長）指派人員赴蘇工作，當由馮組長飭該組副組長盛昌富率領組長陸正章副組長李醉，周家歧莊永基等，於七月廿九日晨六時集合赴蘇，九時到達蘇州，開定樂鄕飯店三二一號室後，上午即計劃偵査與佈置方針。</p>

<p>本月二日廿一區公所（江灣）文化股，召集各保長曁各公私立小學校長，假該區會議　舉行座談會，熱烈商討民衆識字敎育推進辦法。由區公所訓令各保辦公處，廣爲宣傳，督同各甲長挨戶勸導，必要時各保甲辦公處得以抽籤法，令其入學。</p>
<h3>戶籍法規　疑義問答（續）</h3>
<p>（二十六）問：鄉鎭居民爲減輕征稅，往往數家報爲一戶，爲避免壯丁，又往往一家報爲數戶，且有公務員及軍人眷屬　集之地，若照保甲編制數字多增加，保甲長人選亦問題，究應如何解決？</p>
<p>答：可參照縣各級組織綱要第四十五條，及五十三條之規定，暨縣保甲戶口編査辦法，將保甲戶口嚴密編足法定數目。其公共寺廟船戶，及特編臨時等戶，均附隸於普通戶之後，不受數目之限制，至若保甲長人選問題，以盡量選用當地公正士紳爲原則。</p>
<p>（二十七）問：他往與徙出究爲一事，抑另有分別？</p>
<p>答：他往與徙出應爲兩事，他往係指調査時暫時不在調査塲所而言，徙出係指長期離開調査塲所者而言，他往仍爲原住戶口內之常住人口，而徙出者，則爲現住戶內之常住人口。故徙出雖爲他往，而他往不一定即爲徙出。又依暫居戶口登記辦法第三條規定「徙出」應改爲遷出。</p>
<p>（二十八）問：合作社應列入何種戶籍？</p>
<p>答：合作公益社法人，與一般以營利爲目的之舖戶有別，應比照縣保甲戶口編査辦法第五條四款所稱其他公共處所之規定，列爲公共戶。</p>
<p>（二十九）問：承繼兩姓宗祧情形，慼如何登記其姓字？</p>
<p>答：民法第九八五條規定，有配偶者不得重婚，而刑法第二三七條更規定，重婚者處五年以下有期徒刑，故兼祧之事，在民法親屬篇施行前發生者，以不違背戶籍法第四第五兩條「一人不得同時有兩本籍及寄籍」，及姓名使用限制條例第一條「凡中華民國人民之本名，以一個爲限，登記於戶籍簿上之姓名爲本名」之規定爲原則，得指定一處爲本籍或寄籍，並使用一個本名，不能同時兼有兩個本籍或寄籍，及使用兩個本名。並應於聲請書備考欄內，註明兼　情形，以便稽查。如其發生在民法親屬篇施行後者，法律上視爲無效，在戶籍上亦不發生兩個姓名，及兩個本籍或寄籍之情事。</p>

<h3>美商行將起接來貨原料定貨成弩末　洋行之做手與駁之困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕染廠去路之染料原料，近日市面極爲平疲，茶會成交之少，較前益甚，美貨硫化元有NK及HK二只新牌到貨，身骨較六九三及六九二等略低，價亦較小，現市HK售九十萬左右，NK售一百十萬左右，問津者不多，潮藍亦有到貨，尚未出銷，因此種染色並未上市，廠家對於新出牌子之染料未敢遽爾採辦也，硫化碱到貨最旺，價已跌至三萬五千左右，行家以成本關係，不肯再跌，而廠家則多知定貨旺到，尚在看小。據原料業威者談稱，向外洋定貨者，多　無計劃的，家敷旣多，彼此又以保守秘密相尚，及貨品到埠，本短者急於出檔，價乃降至底盤，據其估計，硫化碱保險粉之現市，幾已接近成本，再跌即虧本，如不堪重利壓迫者外，無人肯做也，並稱洋行經手定貨，有幾家果然正派，但亦有乘機取巧之行家混迹在內，在貨缺價俏之際，到貨之派與定戶者，並非全部，且當定貨之始，定戶付與洋行定銀數成，洋行則與國外商行另有契約，無須照數付去。</p>
<p>套用頭寸利潤可觀</p>
<p>因之其浮收定銀，可另行利殖，及國外來貨，其手續係採取押匯制度，洋行須貨卸碼頭，方備款領取棧單、定戶之接洋行通知付淸全部貨款，則在行方得知貨船才抵口岸寄椗之時，現在碼頭不敷，海關手續繁瑣，船自到口岸至起卸，往往需時一個月，此中拆息，亦可觀矣，且目下碼頭不靖，倉庫缺少，小費名目、層出不窮，大定戶或可自理，小戶及普通廠家號家，多委託洋行代辦，其計算之複雜，單據之不全，又造成洋行賺錢之機會，聞某洋行，因此種種關係，今年來已賺進美金三四十萬元矣，在此重重剝削之下，定戶賺錢，已成弩末，現在同業中人，皆望而生畏云，據各方消息，新做定貨者，近來確屬少有，惟據消息靈通者指明，將來到貨，當係美國商行直接運銷、其數量可能增多，查美商在遠東最大之顏料行爲恒信洋行，燒碱則向由英商卜內門洋行大批經銷，恒信早有復業之訊，迄未實現，業中人且屢傳有曾爲德孚洋行買辦之周某，將出任恒信買辦，詢諸接近該行方面之人士，謂尚無確息，南星洋行亦爲大規模之美商顏料行家，其原任買辦王某，業中人亦傳其在活動中云。</p>
<p>偷漏剝削商家頭痛</p>
<p>據接近海關方面者談稱，近來走私甚多，碼頭及倉庫中，　有人指責原貨缺少分量，因之大其負責方面，頗爲焦慮，曾一商請市商會協助，但商會因人手不敷，已婉辭謝絕云，目下市上對於浦東棧房出貨之棧單，人人頭痛，其原因即由於此。據熟悉其內容者言，現在浦西碼頭不够，其爲機關佔用者，更無裨商用，因之浦東倉庫，利市三倍，持單人前往出貨時，如發現缺少分量，售單人與倉庫兩不負責，且駁船費用之大，超過於自美國橫渡太平洋之運費，即以上述之硫化碱而論，現市售三萬五千元，而駁費即須數千元，碼頭小費，尚不在內云。</p>
<h3>公債交易稀</h3>
<p>公價成交更稀，套買較殷，統丙反不逮離牌熱鬧，統丙始終掙扎於六八〇元至七〇〇元之間，缺乏轉變，結果較上週六計徽跌二十元，甲乙尚平，丁種微升十元，戊種則回跌五十元。</p>

<h3>爭取市場交換物資紗布出口之意義華僑需要國貨甚爲殷切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國紡建公司某負責人語記者稱：該公司此次建議政府撤銷紗布出口禁令，主要目的，在爭取時機，奠立我國紗布在南洋市塲行銷之基礎。據云：此事之意義，可分三方面言之：（一）國外方面，最近日本陸續有大批美棉運到。日本之紡織業，迄已開動紗錠三百五十萬至四百萬錠。刻正積極向南洋推進貿易。又英國亦積極整頓印度各紗廠，以期大量生產，擴展南洋市塲。故自國際市塲競爭性一點觀之，此時爭取南洋市塲實屬刻不容緩。（二）就此事之一般性而言，國內市塲對紗布之需要，當須顧到。惟國內市塲之需要，以粗紗居多。對卅二支以上細紗及十二磅以下之細布，如能酌量分運一部至國外市塲，旣不致影響國內市塲價格，且能刺激生產。同時，紗布南銷，將考盧物物交換方式，以易取我國急需之食糖，樹膠，米，煤，汽油，苧蔴，木料等物資。對我國整個經濟，不無帮助。（三）就此事之特殊性而言，最近爪哇及暹羅方而華僑領袖，擬向紡建當局購買各種細紗及色布，合計價值達英鎊十二萬鎊，且望能於本月中旬裝出。故紗布出口禁令，亟望能於期前撤銷，以便如期外銷。此事在紡建之立塲，可謂一舉兩得。綠（甲）紡建所接收之敵產紗廠，其機器設備多以紡製細紗爲主，故因此而可儘量利用。（乙）紡建今後業務，可儘量以國外市塲之發展爲職旨。現聞政府當局，以撤銷紗布禁令，有關我國國際貿易至深且鉅，或將考慮由國防最高委員會備案討論云。</p>
<h3>配售糖賣黑市　當局正籌改善辦法糖行亦有配售可能</h3>

<h3>東北和平談判</h3>
<p>— 本報八月一日航訊　東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>八月裏、東北大平原上，高梁萍高過了人，可以掩沒人畜了，這就是大家常常聽到的「靑紗帳」起的時候。</p>
<p>青紗帳起的時候</p>
<p>靑紗帳對於東北人民的夏季生活，給了一個很大的威脅，因爲迎連續續的大片高梁地，正是土匪藏匿出沒之區，鄕間來往的行人，都互相探詢路上「乾凈」否？</p>
<p>今天，情形不同了，擺在眼前的是比較過去匪患還屬害的問題，那就是「戰禍」了，靑紗帳，是利於某方作破壞工作或是在戰術上的最好憑藉，所以大家都好像有一塊重鉛壓在心頭。</p>
<p>時局，消息，又是常常的在令人憂而喜，或喜而又憂的圈子裏打轉轉，始終找不到邊際和正常的處所，情緒怎能寗靜下來？</p>
<p>為了「領教」而來</p>
<p>七月十一日和十四日，林彪沒有到長春去赴「杜林會晤」之邀，曾令人感到了莫大的煩悶，廿一日李立三代表林彪飛到長春，訪晤車政要人，繼於廿五日，飛來潘陽，似乎給人帶來一些希望。</p>
<p>廿六日，東北保安司令長官杜聿明，在長官部第一次接見李立三，軍調部長春前進分部主任蔡宗濂陪同前往，談話三個鐘頭，會後趙參謀長家驤答記者問，說是：「杜長官和李先生，喝茶吸烟，天下地上，無所不談。」使記者摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>廿七日，李立三向東北行營熊主任式輝致敬，談些什麼？則不得而知，所可知道的，是李立三不能以熊主任作對象談東北問題，同時他也沒有提出實際對整個東北和平的方案，李立三則一再表示此次係爲「領敎」而來。</p>
<p>在杜長官私邸中</p>
<p>是廿八日的午間，杜長官第二次接見李立三，記者爲了要知道這件事的眞象，在火傘高張下，跑到了瀋陽市西南角的崇德街，走進一所惹人注目的綠瓦小樓房，這所房子的主人，原先是朝鮮的某親王，現在則是指揮東北國軍的杜聿明將軍，裏面兩三個小客廳，招待過來往京瀋間的要人，東北士紳，各界名流，解決了不知多少關於東北的間題。</p>
<p>這是一個星期天、門口停着兩部吉普車，客廳門外又有一部吉普車，插着美國的旗幟，上而坐着一個美人司機，悠然自得的注視着嬝嬝上昇的烟霧，一片山石小樹，毫無聲息，一切顯示着靜的氣氛。</p>
<p>裏面右首大客廳裏，則正坐着三個爲立塲和觀感而爭辯的人物，一個是杜聿明長官，另一個則是軍調政府代表董承烈，此外則是林彪代表李立三了。</p>
<p>客廳裏的大鐘，敲着十點的時候，三個人物開始談話了，談的是兩個問題，第一個是遵守一月十日之協定，政府接收東北領土主權避免衝突，第二個是恢復交通，修復第一松花江被共軍破壞的大鐵橋。</p>
<p>李立三說：「在此時修復松花江鐵橋，係軍事戰略上的進攻進備步驟，此外則無其他解釋」，杜長官說：「修橋係爲和平，係爲國計民生，係爲中長鐵路通車，橋修好後，決不運兵，同時我可以說，國軍如果進攻，從那裏都可以過江，不必專靠鐵橋。」</p>
<p>關於第一點，李立三說：「接收東北不一定必需政府批一批的派遣接收人員來，這樣就可以避免衝突了」，杜長官說：「道是遵守中蘇友好協定，必須維持政府之威嚴，只要共軍不擾亂國軍，國軍絕不稍越雷池。」</p>
<p>雙方談話，聲音時高時低，李立三不斷的發出國人於談事時所發的笑聲，同時還不斷說着：「笑話，笑話，那眞是笑話」！湖南人的語調，時時有在「爭取上風」。「壓倒對方」的態勢。</p>
<p>鐺，鐘敲一點了，杜李兩人的意見，始終還保持着遙遠的距離，董承烈雖然在中間有時揷上一兩句話，或補充一些意見，但終究還是沒得若何要領，終於宣吿談話結束了。</p>
<p>松花江「和平橋」</p>
<p>杜長官，在二十八日那天晚上，爲了盡地主之誼，假長官部三樓設宴款待李氏，幷請趙參謀長家驤，蔡主任宗濂，三人小組中共組員，還有美方代表諾曼上校等，共計廿餘人，席間可以說是「談笑風生」「和樂融融」。</p>
<p>酒過三巡，菜過五味，大家又談到了修橋問題，李立三說：「接林總司令電報，松花江鐵橋，已經被貴方修好了一空，余意在談判期間，最好暫時不修」，杜長官一再保證修橋無軍事意義，同時並鄭重聲明：「共軍方面如有誠意信念，中國和平一定可以由東北談判而得到和平基礎」，李氏再表示不同意杜長官的意見，杜長官再笑着說：「我們可以用民意測驗」，惹起了在座鬨堂的笑聲！</p>
<p>美方諾曼上校開口了，英語繙譯過來，是建議在大橋上設立中立地帶，杜長官説：「該橋係在國軍手裏，修復一事，應無問題。修復後我保證國軍絕不進攻，不然執行小組可派員駐扎橋上」，諾曼上校含笑表示同意，杜長官謂：「君願前往乎？」諾曼上校笑答：「余願前往！」</p>
<p>公開，坦白，爽快，充滿了全塲，李氏亦大受感動，有接受杜長官修橋辦法的辭句，惟第二天李氏對於中央社記者所發表：「最後李氏接受杜長官修橋辦法」一語，表示常時並未如此說，他說是這樣說的：「旣然如此，鄙人願盡個人努力，設法避免事端擴大，電請林總司令裁奪，提交長春執行分部解決」。　李立三離開瀋陽的前夕——廿九日下午四時半，行營代表工洽民，軍調長春前進分部主任蔡宗濂，李立三，試談雙方釋放被俘人員問題，行營方面主張雙方全部釋放，李謂林彪並未授權給他，故不能做全權的談判，結果僅限於雙方交換意見。</p>
<p>關於遣送共軍區日僑日俘問題，大致可望逐步進行，因爲這件事，在李立三沒有離開哈爾濱之前，已經由執行小組的斡旋獲得林彪同意的，但技術上的如何進行？何時可能開始？得在李立三回到哈爾濱將在瀋所談報吿林彪後，方能得共方正式提出答覆。</p>
<p>瀋陽電力差得太多，從小豐滿輸電到達瀋陽的問題，是和遣送共軍區日僑俘同時獲得林彪的同意的，現又經過了董市長文琦和李立三的折衝，在技術上獲得了解決辦法，即所派遣工程人員，都帶市府和三人小組分別加印的「修復綫路工程隊」臂章，此外還得有身份證明書，隨同共方所派聯絡人員前往，進行修復梅河口到南雜木間破壞之綫路，八月一日由瀋陽出發，有人說：「這是和共方有利的，因爲小豐滿電源，握在國軍手裏，僅有一段綫路通過共軍區域，他們藉此也可獲得了電力」。</p>
<p>三十日上午，李立三乘飛機飛到長春了，接着是飛哈爾濱覆侖，在瀋陽五天整，僅係在各項問題原則上和軍政當局交換意見，因爲意見距離仍遠，是以未能獲得具體的結果，李立三不虛此行乎？是完全爲「領教」而來耶？雙方所獲得的是什麽？這要大家自己去體會了！</p>
<p>二十五日舉行追悼會，省府劉主席親臨祭奠，富於情感的劉主席，竟致痛哭失聲，而幾乎不能　　，興祭全體人士、亦極受感動，全堂大哭，　　劉主席親請省黨部陳主委，及省保安副司令劉藝洲，警察局長齊　　等　　緝兇辦法，並對各負責人員訓示嚴緝務獲，不使逃逸，並卽　成劉副司令負責其事，中央間訊，亦有電來，務緝　兇。</p>
<p>劉副司余負責來辦理本案，是一位很適當的人物，三十年運動中州的洛陽　　　被綁架暗殺案大案件，　　獨坐靜室，深思　時，往往至三五個小時之久，而畢竟總會被他識破機關，故張案的破獲，想只是時間問題，不過一般人士，都希望能夠迅速破獲，　快人心，復興地方！</p>
<p>開封新聞界尤為嘩然，一致認爲這是卑劣可恥的行為，不過我們總希望一方面迅速破案，一方面要有亡羊補牢之計，警衛部署，確實太欠週密了呵！</p>
<h3>張炎茂被刺之謎</h3>
<p>— 開封二十七日訊　劉繼</p>
<p>昆明李聞案一彼未平，開封突又發生省黨部張書記長炎筏被刺案，像這樣的無法無天，實令舉國震驚，當局應即迅謀有效防杜辦法，便不再有同樣事件發生。吾則社會必將益增動搖與不安。</p>
<p>張案殊出乎一般人意料，因爲張氏爲人誠篤謙和，沈靜寡言，且向在中樞服務，旣不致開罪任何人，更沒聽設與地方有什麽怨尤，二十三日淸晨，記者正與三二友好在室內談天，突然有一位朋友走進來說，「張書記長被刺了，」一語甫發，舉座爲之駭然！根據上面所說張氏的生平，這事眞太離奇了！</p>
<p>據說張氏於二十三日淸晨，照例乘自備八力車赴省黨部上班，行經延壽寺街拐角，突有騎脚踏車者二人，身着新製草綠色制服，腰掛盒子砲，向張氏追來，連呼站住，車夫誤以爲係友好，乃停車，張氏亦即下車，一脚踏地，一脚尚在車箱，二人中之一人，即出槍向張氏頭部發一槍，未中，其他一人，又連發數槍，的中三槍，張氏當即斃命，該二人見目的已達，乃乘脚踏車逸去！</p>
<p>延壽寺街雖居偏僻，但係在城內，且肇事地點之街口設有崗警，乃於白畫竟使兇手消遙逸去，殊不知崗警所司何事，據說崗警當時不知其事，事後始知，乃迅返所報吿，及至各方開訊，奔赴肇事地點，張氏家屬及生前友好撫屍痛哭，各負責治安人員亦殊無何緝捕之術，各省級首長亦紛探視，但是大家都沒有什麼好辦法，主要的是因為這事太離奇了，簡直找不到什么線索！</p>
<p>張案發生後，人心惶惶，各機關門禁因而大加森嚴，據一般人研討本案原因，歸納起來的有兩種，（一）政治性的，（二）仇殺性的，但究竟是怎麼一回事呢？一直到現在還沒有得到結論，因爲大家推斷張氏不致有什麼仇人，至於政治性的，那就難說了，不過由兇手的情形，可以知道先是有詳細的計劃和凖備的，幕後有策動主使者，可以斷定。</p>
<h3>颱風談屑</h3>
<p>— 鄭子政</p>
<p>颱風名詞原由粤語之大風引用而來。此類大風係是一種熱帶性反鐘向之氣旋。其成因由於東北信風與西南季風相衝擊而起氣流之漩渦。故颱風往往形成於赤道氣團與副熱帶氣國間之界面。在颱風形成地帶日射旺盛，對流甚强；溫度濕度均高。以此氣團形成之熱帶風暴，乃使颱風中心蓄存高度之位能。颱風形成之區域以過去三十四年之經騐，大抵發生於關島之西與雅比島之北。惟略有季節變動。初夏時其發生之緯度稍偏南，在盛夏時其產生之緯度轉偏北。颱風之動向先目東徂西，達轉向點後，又改向東北，其行徑雖無規則，大致作拋物綫形。颱風侵襲中國沿岸者大抵以七月間爲最多。於過去三十餘年中有六十五次。在八月中祗有四十八次。九月有二十次，六月中祗見十次。在六月以前九月以後颱風之勢力，　及中國沿岸。颱風　常來襲中國之路徑，大致可分爲二·一·自菲律賓羣島之東，向西北推進橫過呂宋島北部至中國南海中，轉向侵襲中國南部，於夏初秋米其行徑循此途者頗多。二·自呂宋島之東北，向西北或北西北推動穿過琉球羣島南部，橫過台灣或掠過台北而襲擊中國東南海岸。査在中國沿岸登陸颱風之次數。其中百分之七十在鎭海，香港間登陸。更確切說颱風在北緯二十五度以南登陸者居百分之六十八，在北緯二十五度以北登陸者僅有百分之三十二。颱風登陸以後，風勢銳减，然亦有　續支持其力量轉入黃海進達朝鮮，或跨過長江而窺華北者，祇是爲數頗少。颱風勢力北向之程度，以其次數論百分之六十以上不過北緯四十度。颱風移動之速率平均每小時十五英里‘但其移動之最高速率可達每小時四十英里，在東海中颱風之行動比較滯緩，立每小時十三四英里，在黃海中移動較速，約十八九英里。當颱風行動方向將轉變時其行動特顯遲鈍。轉向後移動之速率常較轉向前之速率，增加達一倍有半。颱風自形成至消失，近年在遠東所見可達二十六日，但大多平均不過六七日光景。颱之風勢火致迫近中心一百英里時始覺風緊雨驟。颱風來時狂風暴雨，　國前一年七月十一日颱風經過呂宋北部，於二十四小時內降雨達四十六英寸開全世界暴雨之紀錄。民國十五年七月十九日颱風撲香港，一日之間降雨逹二十一英寸之多。因颱風光臨而在東南沿岸一帶造成之雨災，自民元至民廿一年間有九次之多。此種颱風造成之災荒，以民十一年八月二日汕頭之風災最為慘重。此次死亡人數逹六萬人之多。損失估計當年逹七千萬元以上。以過去紀錄考證上海及鎮海間先後所見登陸之颱風祗有十六次。在上海附近所受颱風之威脅校之溫州以南，輕减多矣。現時關於颱風之報告除由定舶於大洋中之船隻及島　氣象站按時供給天氣報吿外，每有新颱風發見時日隨時派測候專機前往偵察，以確定其位置。目前僅有關島及馬尼拉有此項飛行偵察大氣之設備。中國如海運發展與海軍建立時，此項協助天氣偵察之設備，實屬必備。中國沿岸一帶之人民年受颱風之損失，雖尚無確切之統計，然臆測定屬可觀。至於一般舟子漁民身家所寄，感受之困苦，更屬深切。上海爲一國際性之商港，各國往來船舶對於氣象報吿之需要。及謀氣象建設之進步，　　政府當局能注意及之，多予協助，不僅在商航方面均感利便。在漁民舟子亦將受惠不少。</p>

<h3>瑞士　國際的夏都</h3>
<p>廬山，今日已成了中國的暑都，那裏林木淸幽，流泉繞屋，身居山中，眞是不知人間尚有炎夏。但是世界的暑都、則在瑞士。那裏不但氣候溫和，四季如春，而且有些高山頂上還終年白雪皚皚，即使是在七八月間　陽當空的中午，也還是會使人微感寒意。戰前，每到夏天，成千成萬的旅行者由空中·陸上到這個小國來避暑，這在瑞士政府一向是一筆頗爲可觀的收人。戰爭的幾年中，大家都在生死的綫上肉搏，瑞士自然也冷落了許多，現在，戰爭勝利，瑞士風光旖旎的山上水畔、又將恢復從前的盛况了。</p>
<p>瑞士全境多山，亞爾帕斯山縰橫全境，差不多佔了它全部國土的五分之三。初到瑞士　　　片地方就好似一座假山分景，　　起落，蔚爲奇觀、有的山峯高聳入云，傲視下界；也有的連綿起伏，好似海上的波浪，前後相逐；在這些高高低低的山峯間，就點綴　無數大大小小的城鎭村落。</p>
<p>瑞士的風景、也正像亞爾帕期山南段和北段的情形一樣，充滿着許多截然不同的景觀，甚至一村和一村不同，一鎮和一鎭不同。有些地方，似乎完全是北極帶的景觀，一片荒凉，草木不生，但走不到幾點鐘，你就又會發現另一片天地，一帶南方式微風醉八的高原，長滿着翠綠悅目的橄欖樹，松柏和玉蜀黍。這一處是寒冷　殺，那一處却又是和暖如春，瑞士眞是個令人神往的地方！它的空氣中似乎水遠有着一種淸澈的新鮮。</p>
<p>有趣的是在建築方而也是如此。在瑞士，你隨處可見古色古香的老派木屋，木板的晒台，和色澤鮮艷的牆壁，但同時也可見巍峨高聳的，法國式的大理石建築，並列道旁。</p>
<p>談至此，我們當然還得特別提一提瑞士聯邦的首府日內瓦，和它名聞世界，幾乎每一遊客必到的雪浪湖。雪浪湖四面環山，風景秀麗，這是不必說了，湖邊（其實應該說是湖中）還有一着一所極富歷史性的監獄，叫做「雪浪堡」。它造在湖中，四面繞水，有些　室，　至造到水底，成了一座銅牆鐵壁的水晶宮，粼粼　水拍　　外，整日只有一綫微光，打從鐵欄杆的小窗子透射進來。外面是一片山明水秀的世界，裏而却是與這一切永遠絕緣了的，悲慘悽切的人生，此情此景，能不令人傷悲！一位爲瑞士獨立而辛苦奮鬥的志士，就曾被捕關在這座「雪浪堡」裹二十五年。英國十九世紀的名詩人拜倫遊歷至此，便曾寫過一首名滿歐洲的短詩，歌頌此堡。自此以後，這座矗立湖中，久爲風雨剝蝕的監獄，就成了世界上被壓迫人民愛自由求獨立的象徽。（君默）</p>

<h3>留學考試二事欠當</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我係參加此次敎部舉辦公費留學考試之一員，對於滬敎局事先縝密籌劃，監試愼重嚴正，考試時秩序井然，曾無任何弊端發現，正如貴報所稱「爲各地辦理考試者所僅有現象，」殊感欣佩。但敎部於　訂章則及試題方面，似欠斟酌，而失公允之原則，爰舉兩端，擬　貴報備各方商確：（一）此次遣送國別，共分英·美·加·澳·法·比·意·荷·丹·瑞士及瑞典等十一國，其中除英·美·加澳外，其他各國，自有其通用語言文字，而敎部此次規定：除不諳報考國語文者，一律可用英文代替，試各生不熟諳所在國語文，則出國後安能聽講閱讀，以至進修。（二）此次專門科目試題，均用英文，則令一般並不諳英語，而更無意去英美者，有題意無法瞭解之現象發生。且一國有一國之特徽，於此等處，自有其獨到之見解，卽專門名詞及所用記號等，亦不盡同，各生平日瀏覽其所熟習之語文書籍，今一旦盡易英文，則焉能表達其眞才實學，而獲一公平之競爭。惟有有希望當局改善耳。（考生）</p>
<h3>倡組普敎指導班議</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>心理建設誰都不會否認，它是挽救道德淪亡的特效藥；實施這項建設，端賴着「普及敎育」。本市的敎育事業，素稱發達，然以人口與學校相比，那還不成比例。因此筆者向熱心敎育者建議：創設「普及敎育指導班」，至於方法，擬利用公敎入員中的敎育人才，有志爲「普敎班」導師者（或半義務導師）；凡工商團體，能自動徵集學徒職工，在二十名以上者，可往就近「普敎班」照章申請，經審査合格後，指派導師前往授課，（由申請者月貼少數車馬費，或完全義務），上課時間，以放工後較爲適宜；筆者昔年任曹家渡永平義小日夜校校長時，曾一度創辦「普敎班」，當有少數工廠商家前來申請，也曾徴聘公務人員前往擔任，試辦結果，略有成就，這次倘由教育界先進發起，同時懇蒙敎育當局贊助，派員折導，分區籌組，使中途失學靑年，在業餘後獲得就學機會，爲國家社會，定然收效非淺。（讀者陳済平）</p>
<h3>里弄名號重複</h3>
<p>記者先生：我住在提籃橋公平路，道條路上有兩個公平里一個公平坊，一個公平里與公平坊毗連在一處，另一個公平里則隔兩條馬路，也不算遠，公平坊內還有兩個三十五號的門牌，並沒有甲乙之分，送信的郵差和訪友的來賓，天天鬧不淸楚。這事究竟要請誰出來改正才好？我想警察局及區公所編戶籍保甲時應否迅予改正？（瞻園）</p>
<h3>事業費尚未確定</h3>
<p>編輯先生：七月卅一日「讀者意見」欄，「何謂事業費」，內載武進雪堰橋新中鄕，鄉保長已訂定今夏開徵田畝捐云云，茲據個中人吿及並無田畝捐之說，奉令採購軍糧，現經中央豁免追繳，已收軍麥，業經分別發還。至事業費一項，即包括區公所行政經費鄕鎮公所辦事經費與敎育補助經費三種，曾由六月十五日武進第八區區公所區務會議決議與軍糧同時開征，其中區經費與敎育經費，每畝須征麥八市斤，（合四升半左右）方可挹注，現在每畝擬定征麥五升，則鄕鎭公所辦事經費，不到半升，所得無幾，實行儉約，尚慮不敷開支，怎談得到花天酒地的虛糜揮霍？刻下此項事業費能吾征收，尚成問題。誠恐旅外鄉人不明真相，仰祈披露，以釋眾疑爲荷。（殷祥）</p>
<h3>收容街頭吸毒乞丐</h3>
<p>勝利至今，將近一年，政府雖厲行禁毒，惟本市若干里弄，仍有不少吸毒乞丐盤据，鳩形鵠面，襤褸不堪。本市乃國際都市，有妨市容，貽人訾議，莫此爲甚。惟念此輩乞兒大多缺乏敎育，自甘墮落，染此惡疾。希市府當局一方澈底剷除販毒者，加緊嚴辦，一方收容街頭吸毒乞丐，施以戒治。然後授以技能，得有謀生途徑。（北海路金龍）</p>

<h3>公共場所禁吸紙煙</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我們知道香烟的害處，雖然沒有像酒一般的顯明，但是因爲烟裏含有尼古丁，多吸之後，就容易中毒·勝利以後，我們覺得香烟比戰前更泛濫了，但電車車廂內的「禁止吸烟」字樣，已用白漆刷去，其他更難見到有人反對吸香烟，於是外國香烟便人手一支！我們希望當局要取締公共塲所及車上路上的吸烟，和新生活運動時代一樣。（姚國基許毓巖）</p>
<h3>租賃特別法</h3>
<p>編者先生：過去租戶因有特別法的保護，爲了租金的低廉，他們東也租上一屋，西也租上一屋，實際上是超過需要了，但爲了房租低，就不退租，並且還可以出頂，得到鉅大的款項。不知爲什麼？江蘇省政府還在故步自封，發表租賃特別法，限制低價租金及房主不得拒絕出租及強制修理出租，須知限制低和，房主因得不到相當利息，而不願出租。越是不保障房主產權，房主更不敢出租，何能解決房荒？旣不在戰爭時期，無故剝奪限制，亦有抵觸法令之處，不知賢達諸公以爲對吾？（徐幹翰）</p>

<h3>接收後的塘沽新港</h3>
<p>— 本報廿九日天津航訊特約記者李紹林</p>
<p>勝利後我們從敵人手裏接收了塘沽新港，有智之士都認爲牠遠比若干個敵僞工廠，或是若干所倉庫的敵人物資更値得重視，因爲這是個澈底醫療天津喉症的建設，關係整個華北的貿易運輸。從去年十一月，我們對這個根除津沽喉症已經開刀而手術尙未完畢的港口加以接收，最初的管理機構，是隸屬於交通部平津區特派員辦公處下的塘沽新港工務處。四月間工務處撤消，又成立了直屬交通部的塘沽新港工程處，工作是一點一點的在那兒推動，但目前他們祇能作些整理的工作，完成全部建設的計劃，還尙在研究中。</p>
<p>（一）過去一瞥</p>
<p>天津喉症的所以形成，是由大沽口間堵着一個有名的大沽攔門沙，俗稱大沽壩，河北省五條大河會於天津經海河流向塘沽，在那裏，地勢的平坦，使河水的流連减小，泥沙因之沈澱，而於是乎堆成了攔門沙。這塊沙梗於咽喉，使吃水僅十餘英尺的輪隻便不能進口，使天津市多少年來每年吞吐量未能超過一百五十萬噸，姑先不論日本人的目的何在，他們在民國二十八年六月成立了塘沽新港臨時事務所，調査港口情形，二十九年十月就對症下藥，在海河口北岸大規模的興修起新港來。日本人最初的計劃，想使這個新港每年有二千七百萬噸的吞吐量，最後把計劃縮小到八百萬噸。</p>
<p>在沒有說到我們接收以後的情形前，値得看看日本人的計劃，新港位於塘沽以東十五里海河口的北岸，他們計劃中的主要工程，是南北兩防波堤的建築，南防波堤長十七公里，和海河平行，主要作用除防風外，並且可以阻止海河所挾泥沙流入港內，北防彼堤的作用，是在防止東北西北所來的風浪。在兩道防波堤中間，則挖成一條二百公尺寬的航道，並保持六公尺的水深，把牠與海河聯緊起來，同時建築一個長一百八十公尺寬二十一公尺的船閘·這個計劃完成以後，吃水十六英尺以下的輪船在低潮時，也可以賴船閘的節制經航道直達天津，而無須經過攔門沙。關於碼頭的建築，原計劃是由船閘之東，航道之北，向東塡築基地，以次建築四個碼頭及一個突堤碼頭，喫水十六英尺以至英廿尺的船隻，都可以在低潮時隨時靠岸。</p>
<p>（二）現實情況</p>
<p>日本人從二十九年十月動工建築，到我們勝利爲止，南北防波堤的工程完成了百分之五十，第一碼頭完成了百分之九十，第二碼頭完成了百分之六十，船閘工程完成了百分之八十，裝煤機完成兩座，航道已經挖寬到一百三十尺，深度約五公尺，以後的加工和經常的疏溶，該看我們如何去作了，許多專家到新港觀察的結果，都認爲那些半完成的工作應該加速完成，才有利用的價値，否則將使前功盡棄。新港工程處針對這種現實，打算先把船閘的附屬工程究成，這裏面，除了船閘本身以外，包括四項工作：（一）疏濬那條航道的深度至六公尺，（二）擴大船舶的給水設備，（三）擴充電氣照明設備，（四）增設航行標幟，負責人說：祇要有錢，四個月內就可以趕築完成。</p>
<p>新港工程處目前所進行的工作，除了整理那些零亂的散堆在各處的材料外，正辦理着撈修船隻和恢復機械工廠兩件大事。到最近爲止，已經打撈的船隻有拖輪四艘。關於修理方面，修理完竣的有喞筒式疏濬船一艘，拖輪三艘，給水船一艘。正在修理中的，有喞筒式疏濬船二艘，抓揚式疏濬船一艘，拖輪三艘。機械廠是從五月間恢復的，修船工作全由機械廠主持，船閘所需要的大部零件，也已由該廠配製完成。新港工程處的負責人，從南京約定了總工程司，從各處延攪來了一批工程專家，建港的工作是一個考騐，也是一個表現的機會，是看我們建設的時候了。</p>
<p>（三）新港計劃</p>
<p>我們要一個甚麽樣的新港呢？行政院全國工程計劃團的美國顧問杜德上校曾草擬了一個改善計劃，這個計劃的主要部份有五點：（一）完成並加强防波堤，深水部份採用五至十噸的大塊石料。（二）完成並加深航道，使喫水二十英尺以下的輪船可以進港·（三）完成船閘的建築·（四）完成第一第二兩碼頭的工程·（五）完成裝卸設備，和必要的鐵路，公路，照明，給水等設備。全部工程是以每年有二百萬噸吞吐量爲標準·工程費的預算要五百億元。</p>
<p>（四）三個見解</p>
<p>上海濬浦局總工程師薛卓斌先生，來此視察之後，提出了一個每年一百五十萬噸吞吐量的工程計劃。他主張儘先把航道挖深至六公尺，寬度有一百三十尺即已够用，不必加寬到二百尺，但認爲應該在第一碼頭對面，航道之南和南防波堤的中間，挖深長七百公尺寬三百公尺的停泊面積，設置大小浮筒九組，使它可停三千噸左右的輪船七艘，一萬噸左右的輪船兩艘，用駁船來協助裝卸。此外，要完成船閘和岸上的必需設備，而對防波堤則不擬加工。這個計劃的工程費是一百九十億元，新港工程處自已也有一個計劃，希望以每年有八百萬噸的吞吐量爲標準，除了完成接收過來的那些半完成的工程外，還準備把第三第四和突堤碼頭一律完成，以五月份的物價爲標準，需要九百九十億元的工程費，同時需要三年半的時間。上面的三種計劃，他們正在加以共同的考慮。</p>
<p>從新港回來的人，看着那些待救的建築，那些散堆在各處的器材，在感　着這項建設的遭遇。勝利了近一年，接收牠也將滿八九個月，而牠也像難民似的受着飢餓，不安定的海面，趁着不安定的局面，正無分晝夜的向那些殘敗的長堤剝蝕着，誰能讓海水平靜下來呢？</p>
<h3>我國艦隊在哈城</h3>
<p>— 珍珠港七月九日航訊　秋平</p>
<p>這主是因和祖國隔離得太遠了，環境並不需要一個華僑子弟去進修祖國文字和語言，同時師資亦是一個問題，在哈城能稍通祖國文字的華僑已屬少見，至於能說國語的更是鳳毛麟角了。</p>
<p>隨後他邀我們到他家裏去。這是個生活富裕頗有聲望的華僑的家庭。客廳裏掛着蔣主席的肖像，另一邊是關雲長和關平周倉的畫片，廊上放了二盆鮮花，這像是國內常見的潔樸文雅的家庭。</p>
<p>他母親是位愛穿旗袍，談吐高雅的中年婦人，週到地招待着，她希望她的愛兒不久能圓到祖國去，接受祖國的高等敎育，能够替祖國服務。</p>
<p>「我們這一代給祖國出的力太少了，下一代的應該獻給祖國」，她微笑又謙慚地用粤語表明着內心的願望。</p>
<p>這是全華僑聲摯愛祖國之熱情，而時間並沒有使他（或她）們遺忘祖國，他們是中華的兒女，他們的心還是屬於中華的·他並沒有忘掉我們呀！我們怎麽能把他們遺忘呢？</p>
<p>晚上，這位敎員又伴我們進華萊館用了一餐旣豐富又鮮美的道地中國餐。自從出國後，看中國戲，進中國餐館已成爲唯一嗜好，這也許是游子思念家園所致吧，飯後，我們和他爭着付款，但是他的衷懇和盛情畢竟贏了我們，然而餐館東主却亦拒收了他的付款，說招待祖國海軍是每個華僑的義務，亦是他的權利·經過這樣一次意外的招待後，我們就不敢再上華僑飲食店了，就是欲想購買一些什物，亦先戒心地看一看門首有沒有「歡迎中國海軍」字樣。</p>
<h3>古巴總統檢閱遊行部隊</h3>
<p>十二日的訪問節目，是古巴總統檢閱遊行隊伍和參加華僑紀功碑揭幕禮。</p>
<p>遊行士兵由十輛嶄新的運輸車戲往華區集合，隊伍前面是古巴海軍樂隊，後面是中華樂隊，中間是旗兵，由警備摩托隊開路，從萬人深巷的華僑區，通過市心，一直向總統府邁進。　緊接着中華樂隊的是三民主義靑年團，華僑代表團，國民小學學生和華僑婦女，齊整漫長的遊行隊伍，却是哈城近年來所未有隊伍到處，交通阻塞，樂聲悠壯，步伐鏗鏘，招着頭，挺起胸膛，直視豪步，一隊隊啣接着，手起步落，彷彿有一綫相牽，鼓掌聲，讚美聲，追着隊伍，響遍了幽麗的哈城。</p>
<p>隊伍行近總統府，兩街竚觀的人羣，愈加擁擠，輪子和黑皮靴在陽光下閃耀的摩托警備隊，拉長汽笛，沿着人行道前後巡馳。人們在人行道上擁了下來，又被擠了回去。</p>
<p>隊伍經過總統府，帶隊官下着「向右看」的口令。</p>
<p>凉台上古巴總統格勞和第一夫人（The　flrst　lady　of　cuba）頷首答禮，由李公使及中國艦隊林指揮官伴閱。府首的廣塲上，古海軍樂隊一曲又一曲，吹奏着雄壯激盪的軍樂。</p>
<p>等旗兵行過時，樂隊又換奏起中古國旗歌。總統和伴閱官一齊立正向國旗敬禮，四周竚觀的人羣，亦迅速地循着樂聲脫帽，肅立致敬，屏神凝息，只聽見大西洋濱拍擊的浪聲和着軍樂，繚繞在人們的心頭，使人感覺到雄壯，肅穆。</p>
<p>人羣跟着隊伍，繞過海濱路到華僑記功碑已是烈日當空的時候，汗珠從應邊透過內衫，但是我們的頭始終是抬起的·我們是支年青的隊伍，我們是經過訓練的。</p>
<p>也許是年輕的緣故，我們的意志是不輸人。</p>
<p>首先由李公使及古巴總先後致詞，頌揚華僑在古巴獨立運動中的殊功，中古友好關係的展開和中國海軍訪問的意義。</p>
<p>在長篇的西班牙文演詞中，我聽見不少「中國和古巴」「戰爭」「勝利」等字句，演詞的內容還是事後一位華僑吿訴我的·</p>
<p>十三日謢航驅逐艦太康太平號開放參觀。舊金山碼頭上中西人士來往不絕，等候參觀的隊伍從靠埠一直排到柵門，街心還有據擠着設法入內參觀的人羣·</p>
<p>我和廣東同學鄧君伴着一羣年靑的華僑和三位古巴女學生到碼頭參觀，苦不能入內，恰巧片刻間有艦上小火輪來候運糧食，遂上輪繞港登上旗艦·埠頭有華僑代表維持秩序，艦上由崗兵指示參觀路綫，參觀區域僅限以艙面及駕駛台。</p>
<p>鄧君用粤語向華僑說明各部位的名詞和功用，我伴着這三位古巴學生到各砲位去參觀，因爲自已是槍砲士，所以就很詳細地用英文介紹着各砲的射程，操作和功效等，從三吋砲，四公分機關砲，二公分高射機關槍一直解釋到船尾的深水炸彈·</p>
<p>從艦上參觀下來，柵門外的人羣還未見减少。我們就在堤岸散步，以港中參縱錨泊的艦隻做背景，攝了幾張相片。她們吿訴我們古巴大學的情形，我們敍述了一些海上航行的生活。和着浪聲，我們歌唱着歌唱到白帆從海上帶來了黃昏，夕陽將海水逗得羞紅的時候。</p>
<p>古典舞藝在美國</p>
<p>美國康納爾大學女生在課外學習舞藝，其活動與跳舞俱樂部，幾無不同之處。此舞名「　婦之散步」，係描摹古時（殖民時代）美國漁民之妻期待丈夫自海外歸來之姿態。（美國新聞處攝）</p>
<h3>中華商會舉行舞會招待</h3>
<p>晚上十時，中華總商會舉行跳舞會招待艦隊軍官，國民黨和致公黨部亦分別開雞尾酒舞會招待士兵。</p>
<p>殷勤的招待，深情的微笑，今夜赴會的比昨夜更擁擠了。繡邊的西班牙式的長裙捲拂着潔白褲袖倚偎着，默默地輕步迴舞。</p>
<p>昨天的風濤聲被歡笑所掩沒，明天是多麼遙遠的日子，多少人在溫情的眼光中獲得了愛的解釋，言語和文字是多麼無力的東西呀！</p>
<p>在舞會上，經過致公黨間明公報主筆的介紹，認識一位古巴貴婦人，高雅的舉止，流俐的談吐，好像是在巴黎宴席上一位愛好交際的貴夫人，是古巴婦女總會的秘書，趣雅地表示着能來參加歡迎中國海軍的舞會是無上的榮耀，並且說她在大學裏是念外空的，接着又解釋地說這似乎是全世界一般不够前進的情形，亦正是答覆了她任婦女總會秘書的原因。</p>
<p>室內抑揚着輕快的西班牙音樂，室外圍坐了一對對人影，微笑，頷首，眼光在傾談着。寗靜幽麗的濱市的夜，默默的情波泛遍了夜空。</p>
<p>一陣熱烈的掌聲，致公堂主席朱家兆欣喜地迎引着李公使和林指揮官走進塲，音樂沒有停止，將歡笑和注視一齊拋向他們·徐參謀到平唱起「何日君再來」·婉約的歌詞·像一片秋雨，灑落在年靑的心頭·</p>
<p>歌聲停後，靑年們開始忙碌起來，交換禮物，保留通信處。明天，海浪將我們帶得更遠，但是記憶將永遠是鮮明的·</p>
<p>「別了，哈灣拿、中美的麗都、「別了，美麗的小姐（Seuovta　Bonita），中華兒女們」·</p>
<p>馬達聲割絕了綿綿的吿別，揮舞的手娟消逝在晨曦裏。凝視着在海浪中起伏的白色建築抑揚地，甲板上有人吟唱着「偶然」：「我是天空裏的一片雲，偶而投影在妳的波心，妳不必迓異，更無須歡喜，在這瞬息間消滅了踪影·妳我相逢在黑暗的海上，妳有妳的，我有我的方向，妳記得也好，最好妳忘掉，在這交會時互放的光亮·」</p>
<h3>中國工業之花復興中的永利錏廠</h3>
<p>— 本報一日南京訊特約記者丁維棟</p>
<p>（一）逃過難關</p>
<p>浦口的永利硫酸錏廠能够存在到今日，爲我國的復員建設而努力，是抗戰未結束時所不敢想像的事·這廠已經逃過了三次毁滅的機會了。第一次是上海抗戰時敵機的轟炸前後共達四次，但是由於敵人技術惡劣，廠的主要部份並未受傷。第二次是廿六年十二月二十日該廠工作人員撤退的時候，由於時間的倉促，除了拿走了些責重的零件之外，並未施以大規模的破壊。第三次可能的破壊，是在抗戰勝利的前夕；準確的說，民國卅三年四月華西超空堡壘基地成立之後·據永利錏廠的友人吿訴我：那時美國大使館正式派員去見范旭東先生，索取該廠的各種照片，以供實施戰略轟炸的參考。范氏慨然把照片都送去，同時痛苦的對人表示：他戰後必重建一個錏廠，而不去恢復舊廠，因爲他不忍看見瓦礫一片殘破不堪的慘狀。以後美空軍曾到過永利錏廠的上空，而且他們一定認得這個目標，但是他們只對煤氣廠打了一排機關槍，而沒有投炸彈，於是永利廠又逃過了毁滅的命運·不到幾個月，敵人無條件投降由於受降的規定，他們負了保管的責任，不敢隨意破壊，永利錏廠終於完整地歸來了。前幾天，聯總兩位外籍專家來參觀錏廠，事後對人表示！他們考察過中國各地的工業，包括台灣在內，接收後復工的迅速，工作人員熱忱之高，沒有超過永利的；同時工廠規模之大，設備之現代化亦以錏廠爲首屈一指。今日作者身臨其地，目擊該廠的宏大規模，和工作人員的高度熱忱，亦深感此廠實爲中國工業的精英。它的存在，實是由於命運的默佑，否則以現在的國庫艱難，想協助工業家來辦如此規模的工廠，眞不知何年何月，方能成功！</p>
<p>（二）設廠目的</p>
<p>永利錏廠設立的目的，國防第一，民生在次。九一八事變之後？中區已定自力更生的國策，以爲自强籞悔的基礎·錏廠亦是這個國策之下的產物，雖則在性質上它是一個民營工業。民國廿二年時，主席召見范旭東氏，籌商建廠的大計，這位傑出的工業家當時表示：他願意爲國家盡力，但是錏廠需要的資本浩大，籌資方面，需得政府的協助；其次，伅很不贊成官商合辦，而主張官督民營·這兩點請求，當時立被採納。地點之決定在浦口，亦是當局之意，理由不外是接近首都便於督導，同時亦便於外賓之參觀，使他們對於新興中國的建設決心，產生難忘的印像。到民國二十三年，建廠工作正式開始，當時由永利公司發公司債一千五百萬元，由政府担保本息，由各大銀行承銷。技術設計方面，則由美國工程師主持。永利的朋友吿訴我：這是極專門的工作，當時建立硫酸錏工廠的，一共有三個國家——中國日本蘇聯；中國的廠在浦口，日本的廠在大連（規模比我們的大一倍）蘇聯的廠在歐洲。而負設計之責者，都是這批美籍技師。在以後的兩年內，永利的人員以最大熱忱工作，由於他們的努力，中國的工廠首吿成功。到民國二十六年二月，永利硫酸錏廠正式開工。</p>
<p>在七七事變以前，永利錏廠的產品是錏，而不是硫酸硝酸，理由是不願和本國的中小工廠作競爭。當時他們曾爲錏的銷堪担過心，因爲英商卜內門的貨，向來是控制市塲的。但是事實證明這是杞憂。當時，永利和廣東福建兩省訂立契約，承銷錏廠的全部出品。工廠所在地之江蘇，反而買不到永利的肥田粉。在相當時間之後，證明永利的出貨，品質優於舶來品·第」，舶來品遠渡重洋，風吹雨打，容易受潮；第二，永利出貨的含氮成分，較之舶來品多0．8％·因此錏廠的信譽建立，雖有每日一百五十噸的產品，依然是供不應求．到抗戰發生，錏廠立即轉成國防工業，每日生產一百噸以上的硫酸硝酸，供給軍事上的需要。那時軍政部派有專員駐廠，以便聯繫。所可惜的是永利報效抗戰之時甚短，到廿六年十一月二十日，軍事形勢日非，廠中工作人員奉令總撤退·我曾問永利的朋友：當時撤退之時，爲何不施以澈底的破壊，或將主要機件搬走，以便在後方建廠？他們的解釋是：以澈底破壊而論，撤退得太倉促，當時爲了供給軍事上的需要，生產到最後一天；同時工廠的規模甚大，要澈底的破壊，亦是需要充分的時間和技術上的準備，當時的情况已不許可。至於搬運機器的事，當時更談不到。因爲錏廠的機件太大太重，例如馬壓部份的一個合成器，是一塊混鋼鑄成，重達一百零八噸。這個機件由美運華時，上海碼頭最大的起重機只能提起五十噸的貨，還是永利公司自己造了一個百噸的起重機才解決了問題。在戰時緊急的時候，搬運就沒有辦法·而當時長江運輸的條件，遷廠亦是不可能的事。關於第一點理由，我愧無工程專門知識，不敢表示意見。關於次項理由，在看到錏廠規模之後，再想想後方遷川工廠的情形，認爲確是事非得已·工廠被敵人利用，當然是件不愉快的事。不過在勝利之後，國家能够完整的收回一個規模宏大的現代工廠；從工業化的觀點來看，亦不失爲可喜之事。參觀這個工廠的人士，恐怕都不免有這種感想吧！</p>
<p>永利錏廠陷敵後，敵人對它相當的重視，並積極加以利用。有一批水準很不差日本工程師參加工作，拆走的零件亦用日本的方法加以補救。到現在日本造的手搖離心器依然剩留在錏廠中，作爲敵人佔領的一個紀念。錏廠中之硝酸廠機器則給敵人拆走，運至日本本土，理由是這些機器特別精良，品質上超過敵人本國的設備。日本投降之後，這批機器已被發現，現在已由永利呈請政府轉向麥帥總部交涉，設法運回·同時永利錏廠在戰時的損失，已由廠方開明淸單，將來希望在日本賠償額中，能够取得一部份，同時計劃派員至日，協同交涉，這是十分合理的要求，政府和社會應加以支持。不過，以盟軍總部對於日本的態度來看，賠償要求是否能達目的，頗有問題。</p>
<p>淪陷期內錏廠生產量，顯有低落，理由是永利工作八員撤退之時，已將一部份貴重的零件拆走。敵人對於這個工廠，雖加以利用，但是不加愛惜。原因是敵人自知對於華中，並不能長期佔領視爲自己的產業，能够加意的維護和發展。因此，錏廠八年以來，折舊損耗率特別來得高，自本年一月份起，有整整半年的時間，用於修理方面。到上月廿五日硫酸廠始出貨，現在高壓部正在試用，全部復工當在下月十五日左右，在各個工廠內，修理的痕跡，處處可以看到。</p>
<p>（三）打開出路</p>
<p>永利錏廠由於全廠工作人員的熱忱和努方，已向復興之途邁進，可是由於八年的摧殘，元氣大損，每日硫酸的生產量，據某高級職員表示，約爲六十噸；錏的最大產量據一位工程人員說，最高日產量可達八十噸·據負責人士談：銷路的展望是役樂觀的，錏貨色未出，但是訂貨者已不乏其人·臺灣一年中肥田粉的需</p>
<p>現在永利生產上最大的問題是原料，就是煤的供給太困難。他們表示：錏廠每月需要用七千噸以上的煤，這在今日是一個不小的數目，由於中福煤礦棗莊煤礦在共軍手中，其他地區的煤不能有規則的長期供應。他們不得已而求之國外。在加拿大定了八千噸的煤，價格是二十餘萬法幣一噸，加上運費和其他開支，耗款二十億以上。在沒有開工之前，永利錏廠開支浩大，沒有國家的補助是不能維持的。最近四聯總處批准貸款三十億元，二十億由中國銀行放出，其餘十億元由交通銀行貸出，這是一筆相當大的工業借款，永利同人亦承認國家對於他們是另眼看待的。以蔣主席本人而言，亦時時關切永利，返京以後，召見該區軍事長官時，頻頻以永利近况相詢，並表示願往參觀·</p>
<p>高物價對於工業生產，實在是很大的阻力。在錏廠中，我看到裝硫酸的磁罐，高約二尺，直徑不到一尺，惟性質特殊，不受濃酸的侵蝕，他們說要買四萬元以上一隻，而出了錢還買不到呢！蕪湖的砂，亦爲必需品，在那裏一立方公尺要買九萬元，實在　人　聞·永利錏廠的機器，保險的期限已過，他們現在使用時小心翼翼，惟恐出事，但是在現階段，根本談不到重加裝備·我問他們：是不是希望再向國家借款？答覆是借款不是一個辦法，因爲利息太大·他們希望能够打關銷路，才是眞正的出路，他們對於現在的局面和交通狀况，深表痛心，認爲可以絞死工業！</p>
<p>（四）廠內設備</p>
<p>永利錏廠的廠址在浦口謝家店，離開下關約四十里，輪船順流四十分鐘可到。廠址佔地一千畝以上，內部包括硫酸硝酸廠錏廠高壓部煤氣廠翻砂廠修理廠土木部煉水廠等各重要部份，各廠之間離距甚大，這是受空襲而無大損失的重大理由。廠中現有職員二百餘人，工人一千五百名左右·此外有美籍工程師兩位，名義是顧問，其中有一位是范旭東氏的老友，在永利公司工作在十年以上。錏廠之設計雖由美國工程師主持，但是機器並不完全是美國貨。它選購的標準，完全取決於品質和特長，因此在一個廠之內就有四五國出產的機器。我在高壓部，就看到美國貨的合成器，和德國貨的壓力機，此外還有瑞典貨和英國貨。廠裏的工程人員吿訴我：雖然時逾八年。這個廠搬到外國去就機器設備而言，還不失是一個新廠，出品較之他人，亦無愧色</p>
<p>這家工廠特點之一是安定，工人並沒有鬧過工潮。推究其原因，首先是待遇合理，工資隨時按指數調整；不過最大的原因，還是福利辦得好，技術工人都可以分配到眷屬宿舍·我參觀過單身工人的宿舍，房間的建築和光綫空氣，恐怕要比南京一部份公敎人員的住處要好一些·至於職員的福利，當然辦得更好，永利的職員一向不分紅利，待遇亦比不上國營事業，而能使工作人員安心工作，不致見異思遷，福利辦得好，大有關係。再有一個重要的原因，則是范旭東氏之人格高尙領導有方，他生時是團結永利的向心力，至今永利的工作人員對他懐念不忘。這位老工業家，在抗戰期內，對人表示戰後要建立一個日產一千三百噸酸的廠，他認爲這個生產數目，最能適合中國的需要。在勝利的前夕，蔣主席幾次召見他，希望他能爲國家再辦十個現代工廠，叫他多作準備。他的早死，是永利工廠的損失，亦是社會的損失。據我的直覺，范氏的回憶，在今天依然是永利的向心力和推動力。</p>
<p>工廠中設有醫院，綠色的牆壁，很是悅目，並使人有寗靜的感覺。設有子弟小學，免費供職工的子弟上學，並免費招收附近窮人的子弟，廠裏並設有農塲一片，這是供實騐用的，廠裏出產的肥田粉，先在這片農塲上試騐它的威力。</p>
<p>（五）事業展望</p>
<p>永利整個事業的展望，是十分光明和樂觀，一則是本身條件的健全，二則它已經建立國際和國內信譽，無論維持和發展，都易得到同情和協助。從美國，他們已經得到一千六百萬美元的借款用途是指定發展碱業登永利準備以此爲資本，建立十個新廠，把重心放在湖南株州，購地三千畝建立新廠七個，而把其餘的三廠，和今日的錏廠放在一處。永利有個很健全的營業方針，値得我國工業界的參考：就是他們的股東向不分紅，如有利潤，用之於擴充事業·這種有遠大眼光的企業精神，是値得稱道的。我們研究中日兩國的歷史，發現日本之發展工業，約與我國同時，但時至今日，兩國工業化的程度，相去懸殊。原因固然不止一端，但企業精神之缺乏，確是我們的重大弱點。第一次歐戰時，兩國的紡織業都有空前的繁榮，但是日本紗廠提的公積金特別大，而中國紗廠的注意力集中於分紅，結果不景氣的潮流來襲，日本工廠還是立得住脚，而中國工廠則望風而倒，所以永利這種爲事業而輕利潤的作風，在中國是値得大大提倡的。</p>
<p>永利的事業當范旭東氏在世時，工廠事業的管理，是人治重於法治。一切沒有剛性的成文法，但是運用自如，一切可以做得通。公司各部份的職責，並無絕對嚴明的劃分，工作人員的任用保障，亦無一定的規章。但在范氏大公無私的精神指導下，公司內部人事協調，朝氣蓬勃。現在范氏已逝，法治的需要已開始感覺到。永利的事業已有宏大的規模和悠久的歷史，要發揚光大，僅憑良好的傳統是不够的，制度化才是成功的保障。</p>

<h3>怎樣處理離婚者的孩子？</h3>
<p>— 尚未成</p>
<p>弟弟從一位朋友家回來對我說：那家的一個小妹妹對他說：「你們男人沒有一個好的」。</p>
<p>從一個六歲多的女孩底嘴裏會吐出「你們男人沒有一個好的」的一類的話語是一件可怕的事·並不是可怕在說這句話，而是可怕在孩子底腦海裏竟會藏有這種偏激的見解！</p>
<p>道是從那兒來的呢？我堅信是從她底母親那兒得來的。我知道她家底底細，這孩子底母親是被動的離婚者，離婚後，孩子是歸母方撫養的。而且，有一次，我曾親耳聽到她底母親說過：「男人那裏會有好的！」</p>
<p>夫妻因了決不能繼續生活在一起而離婚，是一種開通的，正確的，賢明的辦法。但是，我們相信，離婚底原因，多是兩性生活的不協調，多是有第三者所揷足，亦很少不夾有性的問題在。說得明白點，因爲夫妻之一已另有所歡所引起。有所歡者對原有的配偶冷淡，甚至厭悲，另一配偶少不了就引起了嫉妬，和所謂的吃醋。厭惡，吃醋和一些不重要的因素加起來，就是吵架，就是「意見相左」「勢難白首偕老」的上文。因此，離婚者一定有一個是主動的，另一個是被動的。—這裏所指的主動並不是指最先說「我們離婚好了」的一個，被動亦不是指說「離婚就離婚」的一個。這裏的主動者就是指造成離婚眞正原因者而言—主動者底內心所感到的祇是從前的一個是不能使自己滿意的，這一個一定是最好的，和她（他）成爲夫妻就一切都滿足了—事實上是很少如此的，但，那時確是如此想的—。在被動者，亦就是被遺棄者呢？她（他）第一個就是傷心，失望，嫉妬！…這些就勾起了「失去的夢」，往日的溫存，情話，甜蜜就潮湧般地滾進腦海，而感到她（他）底配偶不可靠，以前的事祇是一個騙局！於是乎，自她（他）底心底裏，迸發出一種不可揭制的情感：恨。不但恨自己底命運，恨自己底傻氣和糊塗，恨她（他）底情敵，並且更恨她（他）底配偶！恨是要發洩的！剛强的就會奮發於自己底事業，或開始放蕩生活，贏弱的就會開始消沉：唸佛，信耶穌…甚至自殺。還有一些找到了對象：自己底孩子。（如果孩子是留在自已膝前的。）尤其是女士最常見，她把恨她底丈夫的話對孩子講，孩子大了還好，如果還小可就糟！孩子底精神和心理立刻就受了傷，不是輕傷，而是貽害終身的精神上的殘廢，如果不及早醫治的話。</p>
<p>客觀地說，離婚究竟是一件不幸的事情。但是我們不能，亦不應再把這種不幸的餘波更重地來打擊，或殺害他們底子女！—像上述的女孩子可能終身會不信任男子，曾產生非正常的獨身思想來！</p>
<p>那末，怎樣處理離婚者底孩子呢？</p>
<p>我們相信，父母對子女的愛是最珍貴的東西，一個沒有或缺少受父母底愛撫，—尤其是母愛—的孩子是世界上最不幸者，他（她）底精神上心理上很少沒有缺陷或變態的。因此，我們不主張根本斷絕孩子與父母的接觸！但是我們更不主張，把孩子當作一件補償品「好了，你太傷心了，把孩子給你吧」的辦法，我們不能爲自己底退一步的滿足而犧牲了孩子，我們情願犧牲了自己換取孩子底健全！被遺棄者底心理總是不正常的。不正常的心理，產生了不正常的愛撫，產生了不正常的敎育法，孩子受了這些的結果，影響，就是個病態—上述的就是一例。根據這，我們不贊成把孩子交給被遺棄的一方。</p>
<p>如果離婚的主動者是女方，這是適合的。她底心理不但沒重大的改變，並且還是繼續地愛她底孩子：而她底「新丈夫」爲了討好愛妻亦決不會有所反感。即使她再生有孩子，亦仍是如是，這究竟都是她自己生下來的。</p>
<p>可是，如果離婚的主動者是男方，是不是把孩子交給男方呢？我們不敢說。父親再結婚後很少會完全顧慮孩子的，而和孩子接近較多的後母和孩子祗是名義上的關係。她不會愛孩子的，尤其在自己生有孩子之後！歧視，不平等之類是普通的事！這些會使孩子，尤其男的，產生一種類似上述的觀念：「女人是可怕的，因爲媽就是如此。」那末究竟交給誰好呢。</p>
<p>S君說：最好把孩子交給沒有孩子的寡婦去撫養。這是一個或許可以的方法，但沒有這末多的寡婦亦沒有這末巧，而且，寡婦祗應該是一個暫時的名稱，它不應該是一個人底終身代名詞！她應該再嫁。</p>
<p>離婚者底孩子的處理是一件極重要的事！決不應隨便地，「經雙方同意」就歸誰方撫養！因爲關係於孩子底前途是太嚴重了！我們要找出一個最合理想的辦法來。先進讀者們亦有高見不？</p>
<h3>他更愛媽媽　狄斯女士信箱</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>親愛的狄斯女士：</p>
<p>一個剛做新娘不久的女子，應該是極快樂的，我也並不例外，除了頊在吿訴你這一件事情以外。</p>
<p>我丈夫的母親是在我們婚前不久死去的。關於這事，他吿訴我，要是他的母親不死的話，那末他只願和他母親在一起，永遠不婚。他並且說：他愛母親遠甚於愛我！</p>
<p>就是這件事，使我感到憂傷，因爲我應該希望我在他心中佔據第一的位置。因此，你能不能吿訴我，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>忠誠的蘭德上</p>
<p>蘭德女士：</p>
<p>你應當可以用一些普通常識，來制止你的自尋煩惱而感到憂傷。如果沒有你丈夫堅愛他死去母親的事，在你生活中就沒有一件比較差的事，可以給你研討的話，你很快會厭倦的。</p>
<p>不過我想你的丈夫把愛母親和愛你對比，正是和你常常把你丈夫更愛媽媽的話掛在齒上，一樣的錯誤和近乎愚蠢的·因爲一個男子，不應該把他的愛母親和愛妻子來對比；正因這完全是兩件事，無論在形式性質上都不相同。</p>
<p>你的丈夫在他母親死前，會決定不婚，完全是由於他沒有遇見過一個女子，他感到更深地愛上了的。</p>
<p>因此，你如果能順着他要走的路，他很快會感到母親的愛並不完全滿足，而需要一個女子的愛撫。</p>
<p>像他那樣的固執他的愛，已變成一種「爲惡魔所困的病態」，就因爲母親已死了。他就過份地把母親看作是這樣地偉大，這樣地理想化。因此你決不能爲了這個，和他喋喋不休地引起爭論，而顯出妒忌或是厭惡的心情，應該用更正當的方法，使你的丈夫，有他應有的路。所以你應該快樂而賢慧地接受現在這樣的情形。</p>
<p>這接受是毫無損失的，也並不使你失去什麼東西；再也是愚蠢不過的，就是再要隨時隨地自尋煩惱下去。</p>
<p>快樂和偷悅地給你的丈夫以體貼和愛撫吧！你的丈夫不久一定就會改變他「似乎神聖不可侵犯地理想的愛」的偏見，而復於正常的！</p>
<p>狄斯</p>
<h3>無報酬的工作者</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>連日讀周瘦鵑君的「寄亡婦鳳君」，給予了我很深的感觸，在中國的每一角落，正不知有多少像鳳君的人，繼續地在任勞任怨，替丈夫安排着舒適的起臥，使他的精神全部貢獻社會，使他一步步的跨上崇高的地位；她們更竭盡心力敎育着國家的第二代，給將來的國家創造新的人才。他們沒有名，不爭利，犧牲個人的享受，只是默默地，默默地無休止地忠實的爲家庭服務着，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已。</p>
<p>諺云「成家立業」，這正說明了立業必需妻子來帮助他。可是社會却把家庭婦女的地位壓迫得非常低，即使婦女運動在全面展開的現在，仍把家庭婦女忽略了，更有些不知天高地厚的男性說家庭婦女是寄生蟲，我想萬一全中國的家庭婦女來一次總罷工，不知男性們還能舒適地安心地去上寫字間嗎？</p>
<p>最近台灣的行政當局，諭令公務員眷屬不准坐公家汽車，想不到家庭婦女是這樣被人輕視着。說是爲了節省公家汽油，然則車內坐的若是公務員不相干的男性親友却又當何說？難道男性坐了汽油會减少消耗的？</p>
<p>家庭婦女終日勤勞，社會是不屑一顧的，她們唯一的希望，是努力的使丈夫事業能蒸蒸日上，等到他丈夫有公家汽油可坐的時候，至少是簡任官或機關主管，若在英國早可以自己買幾部汽車了；可是中國官薪的菲薄，恐怕要用一個女傭來分勞都不可能，難得的乘一次公家汽車，也給政府禁止了。我的丈夫並無公家給他汽車使用的資格，但我希望政府對尊重這些無報酬的家庭婦女，至少在國家還沒有普遍設立托兒所以前，她們是第二代的唯一保護人。　—寄自台北</p>

<h3>玻璃鞋（小说）</h3>
<p>— 池沼</p>
<p>鄭霞，那十九歲的姑娘，在××教會學校畢業後，今年春初就到××局文書科當科員。</p>
<p>××局的女職員雖不少，但總沒有像她那樣能引起人注意的，她到局還未滿三個月就「燴炙人口」起來了，有時更成了同事們議論的對象。</p>
<p>她雖是個科員，但只做打字的工作，打字的女員司不止她一個，而她却比別的清閒，閒來就撩天，有了她，冷寂的辦公室裏就像在冬天裏開放着水汀。聽說，她有時還會坐上科長的辦公桌上彎了腰地哈哈笑，她和科長有的是人情關係，所以介紹她來當個配角。</p>
<p>她面上有笑渦，有巴黎式的紅唇，有明快的眸子，更有四呎七吋的身材，一百十六磅的體重，她的媽媽更喜歡替她打扮，聽說這就是她令人喜愛的緣故。</p>
<p>初夏的第一個星期一早上，鄭霞習常地走到局裏來，一踏進大門，水門汀的地面子，就聽到清脆「格格格」的步聲會使人聯想到舞場上狐步舞的節奏，她昂起頭，挺着　，走進文書課，微掀動上唇，露出整齊的貝齒，算是向同事打招呼。</p>
<p>辦公室裏開始有生氣起來了，大家把公事擱在檯上，先咭咭呱呱了一陣。</p>
<p>「鄭小姐，你今天穿新鞋不向大家報告，該罰。」嘴急眼快的小陳，在談笑中給他發現了。</p>
<p>鄭霞只抿着嘴挽着頭笑了，笑渦又顯現了。</p>
<p>「噢！是美國貨，玻璃鞋！」和小陳同辦公桌而對座的老秦，更像見到奇跡。</p>
<p>這消息哄動了整個辦公室，女的投射出羡慕的眼光，男的更趁機要欣賞，鄭霞的旁邊就圍了男的女的。</p>
<p>「聽是聽過的，今天才看到了。」</p>
<p>「我想還是第一雙在這裏發現。」</p>
<p>「你不看報，報上登××穿的才是第一雙。」</p>
<p>「我還以為是透明的，現在看來不過像普通的一樣。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>茶房進來說，科長到了而且還伴着局長來，這才停止了浮動的空氣，使各人復歸原座安靜地抓着公事辦起來。</p>
<p>聽說局長來，鄭霞才覺得自己沒有什麽可幹，她乖巧地搶了潘小姐另一份文件來打。</p>
<p>局長咬着雪茄，科長陪起笑臉，走進來了，員司們動身點首做了致敬的表示，又低下頭來工作了，在相當肅靜空氣裏，只響着打字機的聲音鄭霞的玻璃鞋的動作，更像做了滴得滴得的拍子，當牠覺得有綫眼光幾度向她射來，使她習慣了的姿態也顯得轂觫了。</p>
<p>局長的雪茄烟氣，繞過了全室之後，他說：「關科長，我那裏現正需用個打字的，就在你一課裏抽位上來！」</p>
<p>「是，是，潘小姐是最努力的就調她到局長那兒去吧！」科長背着左手，躬着腰，右手指着潘小姐說。</p>
<p>戴眼鏡的潘小姐驚喜得欠身站起來，但局長却沒有回答，正沉默地用手撫着腮，抓着下頷，眼睛　向別處去。</p>
<p>「哦！我都忘了，鄭小姐也很好，還是讓鄭小姐到局長室去。」科長見局長眼光注意着鄭霞，他機警地改口去。</p>
<p>「就是那末辦！」局長嘖了口濃烟，走了。</p>
<p>「是，是，是」科長覺鼻尖裏起了股酸氣。</p>
<p>小陳和老秦擠着眼，交換了一個會心的目光，潘小姐却臉上浮起紅暈，不知怎樣才好，結果還是坐下來，低着頭繼續打字。</p>
<p>第二天，鄭霞踏進××局的大門，格格格的聲音在扶梯响着，她走向局長室去。</p>
<p>「玻璃鞋高升了！」同事們在私語，從此鄭霞就多了個「玻璃鞋」的雅號。</p>
<p>她走到室門口，小心地把脚步放輕，敲門進去，見局長已先在，正吸着雪茄，心裏覺得不好意思起來，面上泛起了紅彩，低頭看着手錶。</p>
<p>「局長，早。」她站在局長辦公桌的前面，微彎了腰。</p>
<p>「真早，現在還未到辦公時間啦！」聽到局長的溫和的語氣，她忐忑的心才安放下來了。</p>
<p>「鄭小姐，請坐，先和你談談。」</p>
<p>她在辦公桌旁的椅子坐下，但只坐了半個屁股，局長向空噴了口烟，把烟蒂放在缸裏便說：</p>
<p>「鄭小姐在那裏讀過書？」</p>
<p>「我在××學校。」</p>
<p>「是男女同校的？」局長的表情像有點緊張。「不，是女校。」她乖巧地把「女」字提得特別响。</p>
<p>「好，好，在那裏辦過事沒有？」</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>「這又是好。好，鄭小姐就在這裏幫幫忙，這是你的辦公桌，」局長在指點她。</p>
<p>「謝謝，局長！」鄭霞才又感到全身輕鬆起來，兩個笑渦又顯現了，格格格的响聲，她走到自己的辦公桌上。局長貪婪地在注視着她的背影，「名不虛傳」，腦子裏在幌着。</p>
<p>鄭霞在局長室坐了三天，也辦過不少複雜的公事和私事。這幾天，她媽媽更把她打扮得齊整了，她腦子也時時在記着媽媽囑咐她的話，可是她覺得還沒有到成熟的機會。</p>
<p>是星期五吧，下午的辦公時間過了，別的職員都溜走了，但鄭霞今天的打字工作却比往日忙，不能回去，而局長也坐着不走，像等着她的公事要即日辦妥，待他交卷了，舒一口氣，看手錶差不多有七時了。</p>
<p>「做得很妥當，却難為鄭小姐了，好，論功行賞，我就請鄭小姐吃晚飯去，」局長一面看着公文，一面斜睨着她說。</p>
<p>格格格鄭霞和局長走下××局扶梯的聲音，都都都汽車開向鬧市去了。</p>
<p>晚飯後，局長又和鄭霞在××舞廳出現了，因為在吃飯時他已探知她會「蓬拆」的，更加使局長高興了。</p>
<p>「黑夜里的口哨」，這在舞場裏奏演了十多年的爵士樂譜，現在又舊調重彈了，黝黯的燈火下，舞池擁擠了伴侶，他和她就是其中的一對。</p>
<p>溫文的，她貼着他的胸，鼻裏只嗅到雪茄的臭味，他緊摟着她，她覺得他底心胸在急促跳動，少女的羞澀不由得半推開來。</p>
<p>「跳得快活嗎？」他饞涎地說。</p>
<p>「呃」她面上又顯現着笑渦，但胸前離他又遠了些。</p>
<p>「哦，你剛才也說過，你父親到底是幹嗎的？」</p>
<p>「爸爸替市政府「丈量馬路」」她笑了，露出整齊的貝齒。</p>
<p>「你真伶俐，又會說話」，他也從口裏噴出臭烟味來，使她側背着面。</p>
<p>「就請局長幫幫忙，給爸爸找份事做。」</p>
<p>「你父親想做什麽？」</p>
<p>「調查科長」說着，她伏到他胸前，一股熱氣，溫暖着他的全身。</p>
<p>「唔！」他只發出一聲沉重的語氣在思索着。</p>
<p>「局長，肯幫忙嗎？」她又把胸前離了他。</p>
<p>「唔！唔！也好，就這樣辦吧！」他們更起勁地舞起來了。</p>
<p>星期六，××局起了局部的更動，原任調查科科長胡大樾升了專員，另委派鄭士得充任該科科長。</p>
<p>放了工，鄭霞格格格走到家裏，顯現出面上的笑渦，先向父母訴說那委任的消息，說爸爸星期一就可上工去了，樂得她媽媽叫出來：</p>
<p>「好小姐，你總算替爸爸找到個出頭日子，也不枉爸媽養你一場，疼你一場。」</p>
<p>她爸爸起初是沈默的，像感到心中的內疚，但當他在忖度到那職位的好處的時候，不禁也露出違心的笑容來。</p>
<p>接着，鄭霞又忙着打扮出去，說局長今晚又請她吃飯，使她爸爸覥靦地又斂起笑容來，媽却幫着她收拾整理。</p>
<p>直到星期日早上鄭霞才回到家裏來，她和爸媽見面只點着頭，室內也頓顯出不調和的情調，爸的臉色是沉下的，媽是無言相對，結果還是媽把她推進房裏，到了房內，她那還未泯滅的處女心情，使她恨恨地把玻璃鞋脫下，仍得遠遠的。像懊悔地，像羞澀地，她伏到床上抽咽起來了。</p>

<h3>桐花雙鳩</h3>
<p>— 黃幻吾作</p>
<h3>巴耳·蒲爾石（上）</h3>
<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>巴耳·蒲爾石（Paul　Bourget）　於一八五二年九月二日生在法國索瞞洲（Somma）之阿米恩（Amiens）。他的父親于斯登·蒲爾石（Justin　Bourget）是理學士，他的祖父是土木工程師，他的曾祖是農人。在母系方面，他的母親是洛蘭州（Lorriaine）人，血脈中顯然有着德國的血統。在他出世的時候，他的父親是在索瞞中學做數學教員，以後接連地遷任到斯特拉斯堡（Strasbourg），克萊蒙，反朗（Clermont-Ferrand）在那裏充當理科大學的教授。蒲爾石的教育，便是在克萊蒙，反朗開始的。此後，他的父親到巴黎聖巴爾勃中學（College　Sainto　Barbbe）當校長，他也轉到這個中學去讀書。他從五六歲時起，就開始讀莎士比亞和司各脫等人的作品，十五歲時又讀了繆賽（Alfred　de　Musset）的詩兩卷，和巴爾扎克的小說的全部，以及司湯達爾小說的一部份。他於一八七二年在中學畢業，便入巴黎大學研究希臘語言學，出了大學做過私塾教師，並且就在那時開始他的文學生活。一八九四年，他繼杜剛（Maxima　du　Camp）任法蘭西學士院的院長，直至一九三五年十二月二十五日逝世于巴黎，享壽八十三歲。</p>
<p>蒲爾石正如大多數的文人一樣，他的文學生活是從詩歌開始的。最初的作品是卷古典主義色彩很重的哲學派詩集（Poesie　philosophique），包括：海邊（Au　bord　de　la　mer　1875），不安的生活（La　vie　inquiete　1875），愛代爾（Edel　1878）和自白（Les　aveux　1882）。這些詩集都是受着　賽，叙利，伯呂賣墨（Sully　Prudhomme）波特萊爾，以及當時（一八七五頃）法國對於英國湖畔詩人的觀念等的影響而產生的。以詩歌的價值來說，這些詩是不很高的，它們的更大的價值倒是在心理學上·蒲爾石在這些詩集裏竭力把他對於拜倫和巴爾倍·　雷維里（Barbey　d’Aurevilly）底景仰，和他的應用在近代生活上的細膩的分析的個人趣味聯合在一起。那頭兩部詩集的題名海邊和不安的生活，就已很明白地表現出這個二重性，表顯出他的在最　飾的上流社會下面發現了一個深切的心理學的基礎的願望。因為在他的心頭統治着的是心智的力，知識的熱情，所以詩是和他不大相宜的。他是戴耐和富斯代爾·特·古朗什（Fustel　d·Coulanges）的弟子；外加好讀司湯達爾的心理小說，因而漸漸的偏重心理的分析，於一八八三年至一八八六年間發表了一些批評研究的文章。他的論集表現代心理論集（Essais　de　psycholog·contemporaine　1883）和新論集（Nouveaux　Essais　1885），是當時批評界的一個極好的收穫。他選了十幾個法國近代作家，如波特萊爾，勒　（Ernest　Reman），弗洛貝爾，司湯達爾，戴納，小仲馬，勒貢脫·特·李斯耳（Leconte　de　Lisle），冀果爾兄弟（Edmonde　t　Jules　Goncourt）等，來研究時人心理的趨向，一代感覺的狀態；方法嚴密，內容確實，恰恰能指出十九世紀末年精神界的方向。這部書有新的估價和獨到的見解，因此蒲爾石便以批評家著稱，但他的真才還不由此顯露。他在　續寫批評論文研究與寫真（Etudes　et　portraits　1888）等之際，同時還以同樣的研究搬到小說和戲劇裏去，於是產生了殘酷的謎（Cruelle　Enigme　1885），一件愛情的犯罪（Un　crim　　d'amour　1886），謊話（Mensonges　1888）等，這些作品裏，他祗在找尋着他的個人表現。他在他的詩　和論文裏所不能充分地表現出來的心理分析精神，便開始在小說中大大地發展出來了。在這些小說裏心理學者和詩人的才能同時地表現了出來。</p>
<h3>理想主義與現實主義　中國畫往那裏走</h3>
<p>— 史良黻</p>
<p>繪畫，是一種造型美術，最初的產生，是人們對於物體的美獲得一種靈感，用藝術的手法，把它表現出來，作為個人的一種娛樂品，無所謂理論的哲學根據的，特別是中國畫，他從萌芽，生長，到繁榮以至延續的生存着，雖然它也和西洋畫一樣的有着許多流派，他它不是和西洋畫一樣完全在出發點上分門別類而作為創作的圭杲。它是依據表現的類似而區分的。</p>
<p>國畫發展到今天，情形似乎有些不同了，由於這一代的青年畫家受了戰爭的影響，在戰場上在淪陷區裏在大後方，產生着一些反映現實的悽慘悲壯的畫頁，於是有人也就把它和西洋畫一樣看待的倡論着現實主義。認為國畫也應該像東洋的浮世繪一樣的要著重着實生活的描摹。同時在這一論潮裏有些人又喊着：藝術是精神的具體化，特別是中國畫它是以氣韻生動為極詣，它的風骨，氣力，骨梗，體法，生氣，都是浪漫主義的表現，所以國畫應該以理想主義為理論根據的。因此目前的國畫，就不期然的被捲進了現實主義與理想主義兩大理論的漩渦裏去了。</p>
<p>那麼現實主義與理想主義，酒精誰是國畫理論的基礎？這裏我們以第三者的立場，把兩個主義作一些簡略的分析吧：</p>
<p>現實主義的倡論者以為人類的精神能力，認識能力是歷史地發展的，各種精神能力都是以客觀現實為對象。尤其是繪畫，它是一種造型藝術，它是在創造典型，是由某一種客觀現實概括其本質的東西特徵的東西，將他綜合而具體化，使成一個能代表這一類現實的典型，並且在於表現典型的情勢中的典型性格，又因為藝術是客觀性的，而且這種客觀性是决定主觀性的，所以藝術家只要對自然完全忠實地來摹寫，鑑賞者自然能夠和作者一樣能把握所摹寫的自然，發生同樣的興趣，這種興趣的根源是在於自然現實的本身，也就是說藝術之所以為藝術，是在於摹寫自然的「真」。所以造型美術是以現實主義為理論的出發的。</p>
<p>相反的理想主義的倡論者，他們認為藝術的任務不是純為反映現實，而是美的自我的精神創造，旣是美的創造，就是精神的產物，精神的產物旣不是自然的所產，也就不是客觀的東西。因此在藝術裏面無所謂客觀性，鑑賞者能夠和作者發生同樣的興趣，乃是美的情緒的共鳴。以精神感動精神的，換句話說，藝術之所以為藝術是在於美的情緒與美感的經騐。這種美的情緒產生着各個不同的表現手法，這種不同的手法，就是畫家們的靈感的不同，因為靈感的不同，所以畫家們不能像照相機一樣的忠實的描寫得一式樣。因此這種美的靈感與美的經騐才是繪畫的出發點。</p>
<p>綜上所說我們知道兩者的結論是「不以先人只見加於現實，照現實那樣描寫，這樣的創作態度便是現實主義。」「以先人之見加於現實，而予以裁斷或捐棄現實，這樣的創作態度，謂之理想主義」。</p>
<p>那麼，中國畫的傳統與目前的現狀，他是屬於那一派？以何為理論的出發點？我們以為雖然我們畫壇的祖宗在畫論裏對於理想主義與現實主義八個大字從來沒有提到過。但是在六法上，在片斷的畫論裏，我們不難找到一些理論根據的。南齊謝獻的的六法，是中國畫中千古不磨的大憲章，從傳模移寫，經營位置，隨類傳彩，應物象形，骨法用筆到氣韻生動這六個法則的排定，也就等於作品價值的等第的排定。氣韻生動，是被譽為國畫的絕詣，這種氣韻生動的表現，可以說是主管的藝術的表現。正如張彥遼品評吳道子，他說：守其神，專其一，合造化之工，假吳生之筆，所謂意在筆先，畫盡意在也。夫用墨筆，直尺死筆也守其神，專其一是真實也，死畫滿壁，曷如圬墁，真筆一劃，見其生氣，夫運思揮毫，自以為畫則逾失於畫，意不在畫故得於　矣，不滯於手，不凝於心，不知然而然，雖彎弓挺刃，直柱構梁，則墨筆直尺，豈得入於間乎？」這是說作畫不但不應該拘泥於行跡，而且不能以錯綜滯筆墨。再如董逌溝「丘壑成于胸中，旣悟則發之於畫，故物留跡，景隨見生，殆以天合天者也。」這兩段說法，是主張先得之於現實而予以揚棄，然後揮洒自如，神髓氣趣也就自然的流露出來。此外還有蘇東坡說的「論畫以形似，見與兒童鄰」。倪雲林說：「僕之所謂畫者，不過逸筆草草，不求形似，聊以自娛耳」。彥遠又說：「得其形似則失其氣韻，具其彩色，則失其筆法。」杜工部品題韓幹寫生畫的「馬」，極力的菲薄與諷刺！題了一首詩：「弟子韓幹早入室，亦能畫馬窮殊相，幹惟畫肉不畫骨，忍使驊騮氣凋喪？」從這些代表作家的語氣裏面已可以管窺中國畫理的一斑—大多是重神似而不重形似的。</p>
<p>然而國畫的重神似，是不是像意大利的未來派，德意志的表現派一樣的完全抹煞現實呢？不然！我們拿「六法」來說吧：六法上的氣韻生動骨法用筆是主觀的精神的，應物象形，隨類傳彩是客觀的現實的，經營位置是主觀的精神的傳模移寫是客觀的現實的。次如戴文節說：「作畫須得七候，一精緒，二筆與手稱，三色墨淨，四新遊山水（或新見名蹟），五索畫者工鑒賞，六意興，七工夫當不生不熟之際，七候備而後佳構成」，再如畫法中的六長，六要，八格，三病，十二忌都是警惕着畫家應該注意天地間造化的相互關係，某一時期，某一地域的不可混淆（如高山上無楊柳，海灘上無松樹等）。從這些地方看中國畫雖然有些偏向於主觀的理想主義，但他不是完全抹煞現實，而相當的重視現實。蔣錫曾先生說：按繪畫之原理，不外精神與形體的調和，二者不可偏廢，有形體而無精神則形體為死物，有精神而無形體，則精神無所寄托，亦即無從表現，中國畫氣運生動之說，蓋能與此暗合，所謂外師造化，中得心源是也」。這也是說明了主觀與客觀的不可分性，物質與精神，兩者相得益彰，相互因果的，所以一個天才藝術家的創作，不但主觀作用，不違反客觀現實的典型性反而足以加強客觀現實的典型性，這是現實主義者也不能不承認的。</p>
<p>以上是我們把兩者作了一番引證與分析，這里再一談我對於這一問題的意見：國畫的製作，由於我們「民族性」「地方性」「製作工具」「創作方法」的與歐洲不同以及中國文化（特別是詩文書法等）與哲學思想之與繪畫的聯繫性和西方各國的不同，因此國畫與西畫也就不能相提並論，同日而語，我們且就目前提倡成接近現實主義的作家作品來評述：日昨本市八仙橋青年會舉行一次司徒喬的災情畫展，除了三四幅溪山烟雨以外，全部作品是描寫災區受難民衆的棲慘生活狀態，可以說完全是反映客觀現實的作品，暴露着醜惡的現實殘酷的現實，對現實感到極度的不滿。在它的效果上講，不可否認的，它是有着尖銳的刺激力的，入場的觀衆，誰都起着憐憫心與悲戚的感覺。然而在藝術的本身價值上說並不能算是偉大的成功的作品，因為它的內容描寫的醜惡，掩蓋了他技巧的美，使人對現實起着惡感，不能使人起着無比舒適的「美」感，惟其如此，那麼美術創作的目的何在？如果說拿它來作為政治性的工具，激動情感的手段，那麼用攝影機拍出來的情景，不是更真切更能感動人嗎？這種內容和情調，雖然他的構圖，裝璜，款式都是傳統的民族形式的，然而觀衆只能把它作為西畫之速寫畫看或漫畫看，不能把它作為新國畫運動的代表作看的。</p>
<p>不久以前，蔡元培先生提倡「以美育代宗教」認為宗教在行動上仍舊脫離不了「利害」兩個字，只有藝術可以美化人生，道德人生，如果全人類都以美育代宗教，世界也就大同了。因此我以為美術不應該作為政治工具或激動情感的手段，應該利用它的美去安慰人生去美化人生。</p>
<p>中國民族是一個愛好和平淡泊的民族，富有包含同化的習性，特別在繪畫上最能表現他的潛在的蘊蓄的民族精神，一種平淡天真的情調，使人一見就有心怡神甯逍遙物外的感覺，所以反應客觀現實，暴露醜惡的人生直態，是為國畫所不取的，從這些地方檢討起來，我們可以說，國畫的復興運動，是不能以現實主義偽理論的出發點的，而絕對的理想主義，也不能把握這個復興運動，真正的理論根據，還是主觀與客觀的調和，不是絕對屬於那一方面的。</p>

<h3>學校荒</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨天本報第四版刋載了一篇「投考難」的新聞特寫，這情况敎育當局不是不知道的，也許比我們所知這的更要深切，不過知道是一回事，知道了積極設法謀求解决又是一回事，因此，我願意在這裏不厭煩地再替這些入校無門徘徊徬徨的失學靑年向當局作緊急呼緻一次。</p>
<p>幾隻較好的學校（包括課程好，管理好，或設備好）不是不招生，就是招生名額極有限，許多學生的家長這個時期爲了這個問題眞是弄得焦頭爛額：到處託人求情說項。我就替朋友寫過好幾封信，打過好幾個電話。</p>
<p>起先，朋友這樣託我時，我都婉詞拒絕·我說，假使你的少爺成績好，自然有本領考得取的，我不能幫助你講人悄舞弊，而且即使講人情有效，對於你的少爺也不是一件好事，因爲在他的純潔觀念上却植下一個以私爲公的思想，人情與關係操縱了社會，我們這一代已身受其害，怎能再讓它沿襲蔓延下去？朋友對於我這套理論是同意的，但他說：我明知用這個方式是不合理，有害於自已子弟，但也無可奈何，請問投考人數兩三千，錄取名額兩三百，往往十分之一不到，我的孩子雖不是成績最優秀，但自信在水準以上，可是假使遇到同樣的考試成績，因爲名額關係，沒有請託者是很可能名落孫山的·我無法否認朋友這樣答復的理由，因之，也就無法不替朋友寫請託信。這一現象，太可悲哀了，似乎用飲酖止渴這句話才可比擬。</p>
<p>求學者如此衆多，學校如此之少，而敎師的生活又貧苦到食不飽衣不暖的程度，而敎育的使命又担當了建國開始如此其重的責任，一連串的矛盾和最慘酷的哭笑不得現狀，該歸咎誰呢？</p>
<p>一言以蔽之，敎育經費太少·</p>
<h3>算命和看相</h3>
<p>— 童方</p>
<p>我國有不少的命相家，在自已的名字上，加上「哲學家」的美稱，好像不用「哲理命相」來號召，就不足以顯示自己的技能似的。說「命相家」（這名詞能不能成立當然還是一個問題）就是「哲學家」，眞是上海人所說的「噱頭」。試問古今的大哲學家那個會推命，看相？蘇格拉底，康德，黑格兒，恩格斯如果會命相，也許和上海眞左筆袁樹珊一樣，忙得日無暇晷，那裏還有思考和著述的時間呢？</p>
<p>其實命相之學，並不如一般人所想像的那麼玄妙，那樣充滿了哲學味。（當然近代的哲學已經歸入科學的領域），近代歐美的心理學家對於命相的原理，已經找到心理學的根據，尤其是相學的研究，更多運用科學方法。德國的字相學，美國的面型學，法國的情態反應學，已經替傳統的相學，樹起了革命的旗幟，未來的發展都是不可限量的。</p>
<p>中國過去的相命術，至多只能說根據歷來的經騐，而且有許多牽强附會的地方，不足令人置信，根據心理學原則而研究的新興的相術，可就兩樣了·它們發展的歷史還短，常然不能說已完全接近枓學方法，但以後的趨向，一定會使相術在科學領域中佔有重要的地位。</p>
<p>德國心理學家蘭辛博士，憑其二十餘年的敎學經騐著成一部厚厚的「字相學」。蘭辛於一九四〇年會就希特勒和郭培爾的字跡，斷定他們必身亡於戰爭。還有一個相林的著名女明星娜特萊曼妮在報紙上發表了她的簽名式，被蘭辛斷定此明星必一度離婚，再度遭人遺棄，後來都證騐了，字相學的研究，近已由德法而傳至美國，學者輩出。英國近年來科學的相術很進步，專家各就其研究發表專門的報吿·這中間分手相，足趾相，面相，髮膚相·　帶相等·美國心理學家薈萃·他們對這方面的研究也正方興未文。現在只談一下關於面相的研究。</p>
<p>美國心理學家何林華斯從一羣人的情緒反應上推研他們各種不同的性格，以斷定他們的前途，看他們的能力最適宜於從事何種工作而獲得成功。這是科學相術研究的初步。實則，研究各人不同的情緒反應，以測知他們的性格，並不含有斷定命運好壊的意思·鮑林敎授用七種不同的測騐面型與情緒，性情，成功的預期，毅力，思想，體格等方面的相關，漸漸接近了面相所需解答的問題。這種測騐，據多數心理學家的研究，認爲可靠性很大。他和他的學生已經受聘於紐約好幾個實業機關和大商店，在招考新職員時，都要請他們來發表觀察各個不同面型以後的意見，以作錄取的參考。鮑林又依據他十年的觀察和調査所得的經騐，以及數千被試者的記錄編著了一篇專書，叫「面型和幸運」，指出一些幸運者的面型，一些平庸者的面型，和一些不幸者的面型。他的弟子費倫於體態與性格，好尙，命運的關係·繼作科學研究，有不少有價値的發現，他所所創立的而相研究所，已獲得很多心理學家的贊助。威斯康幸大學密西根大學、康乃耳大學，加里福尼亞大學的學生，加入該所研究的很多。雅魯大學福諾爾敎授近年來專力於手紋學的研究，不過他的研究與犯罪學家所研究的手紋學不同，他是想從各種不同的手紋上發見它與人們情緒，性格，好尙等因素的相關度的。據他說，手紋的粗細，與一個人的命運頗有關係，手掌的厚薄和硬軟都可作爲測知一個人前途幸福與否的重要因素。</p>
<p>康朋克敎授原是哈佛大學人類學敎授，數年以來對於由心理學的研究所劃分的「心理的類型」。極感興趣，他的「類型與智力」一篇論文，早已獲得一般人注意，現在他　於科學的相術，日新月異，想從「心理的類型」，發見它與幸福的關聯，另創「類型相學」。醫學家所重視的「血型」。他也想加以研究，因爲由類型」上測知一個人的命運，如果再加上「血型」的分析，也許可以獲得更正確的結果。</p>
<p>心理學家利用種種測騐，以求了解一個人的情緒性格，興趣，智力等，這對於科學的相術也有很大的帮忙。不過，照關辛和另一位心理學家說：用測騐的方法還是直接的，對心理研究用得上，但對直覺地測知一個人的外貌而能了解他並預知他的前途，似乎就多費一層手續了。所以根據心理學，研究而建立的科學的面相術，只可籍助測騐的結果以作參考，但並不須再經過測騐的手續。</p>
<p>有人問費倫：相術如果是眞正建立在科學上的，那麼由一個人的面型便可决定他的前途，似予太側重「定命論」的思想，環境的變遷，人爲的努力難道都不能轉移一個人的命運嗎？</p>
<p>費倫的答覆是很對的，他說：「命運這東西並不是絕對的，而是相對的。科學的相學所要研究的是『一般的傾向』，正如心理學家研究人們的情緒，人格一樣，它可以使我們知道某人的一般的心理狀態如何，而不是肯定其永遠固定不變，一直如此下去。同時，根據心理原則的相術，它可以使人們更深切地認『個別差異』和『特殊智能』的意義，讓大家向學術事業可能發展最大的方向走。』</p>
<p>總之，根據心理原則而建立的新興的科學相術，是一門親穎的學科。我們希望這類知識，能够多介紹點到中國來。在今日這樣複雜的社會裏，我們除了服膺古希臘哲人蘇格拉底所說的「你須知道自己」以外，更應該以適當的態度去了解他人。這對於個人與個人之間的生活的適應，頗有關係。</p>
<h3>不忍一笑</h3>
<p>— 天一</p>
<p>匈牙利通貨膨脹，鈔票不値錢，因此匈牙利政府特發行一名叫弗勞利特之新幣，每一新幣値舊幣四千萬萬本哥。其實我想，如果匈牙利政府不發行新幣，倒還有一好處呢。</p>
<p>現在把這好處說在下面：</p>
<p>如果有一個商人到匈牙利去，而在那裏和他們談話的時候一定離不了這一段話：</p>
<p>「老兄，你在銀行中有多少錢」！</p>
<p>「不多，僅只一萬萬萬元」</p>
<p>「甚麽？多少？」</p>
<p>「萬萬萬元」。</p>
<p>「啊！恭喜，恭喜，那麽請問你日進多少」！</p>
<p>說到這時，這位商人要吃香烟了，於是匈牙利人急忙拿出一張一百萬元鈔票來點火，於是這位商人急忙說道：</p>
<p>「老兄，是一張一百萬的呢」？</p>
<p>「小意思，小意思」！</p>
<h3>爲了生活</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>西藏路上一家照相館，我常常去照相，每一次去的時候總是看見一個十來歲的孩子在很忙碌的工作。我對他不由地發生了一種興趣，希望能和他交談一次，知道他的身世，可是始終沒有一一個好的機會給我，一直遺憾在心裏。</p>
<p>今天的下午，我又云了一趟。常我到了照相館後，又見着了那個孩子。我坦直地對他說；「我要等相片報名請你催一催他們！好了沒有？」他笑着說：「讓我云看一看！」不一會，他跑回來對我說：「相片馬上就好，請等一會兒。」不到五分鐘，他把照片拿來了，我極感謝他，實在辦事迅速。</p>
<p>當這些印象還在腦海中盤旋時，我又想起了原來的念頭，於是我向左右端詳了一下，除了一個女職員外，甚麼人都沒有。我認爲這是千載難逢的良機，即刻利他閒談起來。</p>
<p>我看他正坐在沙發上，拿着一份黃色雜誌在讀。我問他，「你認識字嗎？」他答：「認為不多。」接着一連串不停地詢向他的身世，他一一的回答了我。聽完了他的身世，我內心很難過。他好像不是在說話，而是在呻吟。是的，他在呻吟着照相館學徒的悲鳴。</p>
<p>他是一個才十六歲的孩子，浦東人；抗戰前家庭環境很好；戰後，父親死了，生意無人去做，店只好關門。母親年紀大了，靠着父親在世的積蓄過日子·八年來一直在苟延殘喘地支撐着生活。三十二年，他小學畢業了因限於經濟，無法升學。勝利以後，物價小跌大　，度日不易，因此，他只有忍痛地離開了老母來到照相館當學徒·爲了一日三餐飯，他整日的工作·不論括大風下大雪，或者炎日潯暑他必定要聽他老闆的支配去工作，每天從早晨六時到晚間十一時，在這個時間裏，他毫沒有休息，談到他的待遇，眞是使人啼笑皆非，除了供給伙食以外祇有五千元。進來時五千元，現在還是五千元·我實在不懂他們如何過活？</p>
<p>他又吿訴我，他很願意看畫，很喜歡看書，但是，偏偏沒有一點空暇給他利用。最後，他很悲觀地說：「我是沒有智識的人，只好一輩做牛馬，命該如此！」爲了生活，有何話說？</p>
<p>這是一個社會問題。如今，成千成萬的兒童與靑年，爲了生活的鞭策而綴學，過着悽慘的生活，我相信，還有許多人比這位學徒更慘的！</p>
<h3>不要儘用嘴且常用眼睛</h3>
<p>— 凌人</p>
<p>在多年前，美國芝加哥某戲院內，有一個演講的人，在他演講的時候，只有台上的電燈亮着，台下的電燈，則全部熄滅。在起初時，他聽見台下聰衆的聲音很嘈雜，但是過了一會，聲音减低了，他以爲他的演辭發生了良好的效果，便更加口沫橫飛的提勁地講。半點鐘過去了，嘈離的聲音也漸漸减低了，一點鐘過去了，台下的聲音幾乎沒有了，到了一點半鐘他結束了他的演辭而電燈也點亮之後，他才發覺聽衆全部溜光了·可是，奇蹟地他看見碩果僅存的一個坐在第一排，他驚奇地問那人不隨着別人溜走的理由，那人回答道；『因爲，在你講完之後，下面要輪到了我了。』</p>

<h3>何其辣手！　吃舞女的血揩難民的油</h3>
<p>— 重征</p>
<p>擺在眼前急待解決的問題，就是拯救蘇北流亡的三百萬難民。現在各地相繼響應了這個偉大同情的救災運動。就是爲生活鞭策而過着摟抱生涯的舞女，也慷慨地舉行了義舞救災。</p>
<p>然而，竟有人在這樣沉痛的義舉中，想出了極卑鄙的·念頭，用出極狠辣的手段，吃舞女的血，揩難民的油。其情可惡，其心可誅。</p>
<p>據報載；某舞廳舞女李珍珍當塲有舞客買票一百萬元，竟被舞女管理員從中扣去七十萬元。我覺得七十萬元倒還是小事，三百萬條性命交關，這位先生未免太辣手了。</p>
<p>其實，舞女本身何嘗不是爲了生活，强作歡笑，她們的收入已是靈肉的結晶所換來，而且還要受大班老闆的剝削，她們本身已够悲哀，而今天，她們毅然捨棄一日參加義舞，以强作歡笑得來的錢，捐給蘇北難民。不料這位管理先生，却在一位舞女所得的百萬元中，揩去七十萬元。揩了這機的油，不知其夜間如何安眠？</p>

<h3>Marshal and Ambassador Stuart Decide to Continue Efforts for Peace in China; Government to Express its Position on the Current Situation and the Anping Incident; President Song, US Ambassador, and Others to Return to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 10:30 AM on the 5th, holding a long talk for two hours. Special Envoy Marshall and his wife invited President Chiang and his wife, along with President Song Ziwen and his daughter, to dinner at his residence at 7:30 PM on the evening of the 5th, after which they watched a Hollywood movie together.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Marshall is scheduled to return to Nanjing around Wednesday or Thursday. Both he and Ambassador Stuart indicated that they will return to Kuling within a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have maintained a calm and fair attitude towards the Anping Incident since it occurred. They have also compiled reports based on reports from the U.S. military in North China and other sources, and submitted them to the Washington authorities. Instructions are expected to arrive within a few days. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart plan to issue a statement after arriving in Nanjing based on these instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] The U.S. Marines were ambushed by the Communist Party in Anping on the Tianjin-Beijing highway, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. So far, only the word "regret" has been received from the Communist Party. It is reported that Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are not deterred by this from their arduous journey to seek peace in China. They will continue to build upon the fragile foundation of negotiations prior to the Anping Incident, sparing no effort to achieve success. Marshal Marshall remains in Kuling, while the ambassador will fly to Nanjing on the 6th to realize this noble ideal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart, at 5:00 PM on the 5th, paid a visit to President Chiang, accompanied by Mr. Fu Jingbo. This was the Ambassador's second meeting with President Chiang after climbing the mountain twice. The conversation lasted until 6:20 PM, covering the Anping Incident and the future of peace in China. The Ambassador is scheduled to descend the mountain and return to Nanjing on the morning of the 6th. According to Mr. Fu Jingbo, who told reporters that the Ambassador will stay in Nanjing for a few days and then return to Kuling.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] President Chiang summoned President Song Ziwen for a long talk at his residence at noon on the 5th, then had lunch with his wife, Madame Song, and Song's daughter. President Song is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 6th with Advisor Bell. The originally scheduled reception for journalists in Kuling on the 7th, to announce the government's solemn attitude toward the current situation and the Anping Incident, will be moved to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Foreign authorities here received news from Washington that the general reaction of American public opinion to the ambush of U.S. Marines by the CCP on the Tianjin-Beijing highway in Anping, threatening the White House to immediately withdraw its U.S. troops stationed in China, is a clumsy mistake. Opinion in Kuling believes that the Anping Incident symbolizes the CCP's threat to peace in China and the Far East. The most directly affected parties are President Truman's statement on China, General Marshall's mission in China, Ambassador Stuart's courageous actions, and the National Government's efforts to seek peace since July. However, both the Chinese and American governments must avoid emotional excitement regarding the Anping Incident, abandon appeasement, and continue to strive for their peace policy. On the one hand, they must be prepared for international pirate-like atrocities, and on the other hand, they must guide the CCP's illegal activities into legal channels, ensuring that the CCP's attempt to rebel comprehensively is impossible and that it cannot isolate itself from the nation.</p>
<h3>Admiral Kirk Flies to Qingdao; Details Anping Incident Before Leaving Shanghai Yesterday, Saying the Truth is Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th Dispatch] Admiral Kirk, accompanied by his wife and son, flew from Shanghai to Qingdao at 5:30 PM on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon for Qingdao. Before leaving, he hosted reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city at the Cathay Hotel, reporting on the "Anping Incident." He believed that the CCP's news agencies repeatedly accused the "U.S. Marines of attacking the 53rd Regiment of the Communist Army," which sufficiently proved who was responsible for the incident. At the beginning of his report, Admiral Kirk first pointed out that the U.S. military's mission in China was to assist in restoring a peaceful state in China. For this purpose, the U.S. Marines maintained regular traffic between Beijing and Tianjin, once every two weeks, to deliver supplies to the Beiping Military Mediation Department and the U.S. military there.</p>
<p>"In some areas along this highway," Kirk declared, "there has always been the presence of the Communist Army. The attack on the U.S. military supply convoy occurred when it was passing through that section of the road."</p>
<p>According to Admiral Kirk's detailed report on the Anping Incident, the main body of the convoy consisted of twelve trucks, each weighing 12.5 tons and fully loaded with military equipment and food, one truck from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), three U.S. military officers in another vehicle, and a lead convoy consisting of two jeeps and two one-ton scout cars, all equipped with automatic rifles and machine guns. At 12:20 PM on the 29th of last month, the lead convoy arrived near Anping and saw two oxcarts blocking the road. U.S. troops immediately got out of the vehicles to investigate the obstacles. At this moment, a hand grenade suddenly flew over, followed by five or six more. Colonel Kerwin, the U.S. officer in charge of the convoy, was killed instantly, one Marine was killed, and twelve were injured. One more Marine died from his injuries that evening.</p>
<p>At the same time as the hand grenade explosions, rifle fire was directed at the U.S. troops from both sides of the road. Machine guns were also firing from a village about 300 yards from the road. A fierce battle lasted for four hours. A white flag then appeared in the village. The U.S. military sent three people to investigate, but one of them was shot and killed. Fortunately, the attackers finally stopped firing and left.</p>
<p>Admiral Kirk estimated that the attacking force consisted of more than 300 people, most of whom were wearing gray Communist army uniforms and Japanese army caps left behind by the Japanese army. If there were any, at least three had been killed, and the number of wounded must have been higher.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the reporters asked questions. Based on Admiral Kirk's answers, the following can be summarized: (1) The U.S. Marines are still traveling back and forth on the highway between Beiping and Tianjin, transporting food and supplies. (2) The truth about the Anping Incident is still under investigation, but no protests have been lodged with Yan'an. (3) Except for the Northeast, the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war is almost complete. (4) The total number of U.S. Marines in China is between 22,000 and 23,000, but he did not comment on the rumors of an imminent withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Admiral Kirk said that the Anping Incident involving the U.S. military was being handled by Special Envoy Marshall. He solemnly stated that if such an incident were to happen again in the future, the U.S. military would retaliate in self-defense. He also said that the U.S. military would not change its consistent position because of this. There are a total of sixteen U.S. warships in Qingdao, and eight have already been handed over to the Chinese Navy.</p>

<h3>U.S. Troops in Tianjin Attacked Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 5th Dispatch] This morning, a U.S. officer was driving back to the East Barracks and was shot at when passing over the iron bridge. The U.S. Marines reportedly went to investigate and were ambushed on the way back. Many shots were fired, and the U.S. Marines took cover, so there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] This morning, machine gun fire was heard in the eastern district of Tianjin, believed to be beyond the Beining Railway.</p>
<h3>After the Anping Incident, National Army Has Garrisoned Xianghe; Local Communist Army Changed Unit Designations and Fled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] The Communist army in Xianghe City, aware that the National Army would inevitably garrison the city after the unfortunate incidents in Da Xia Sha He, withdrew its entire army on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the political workers also withdrew at the same time. The requisitioned grain and fodder were all transported to Pinggu. The National Army then entered the city. The Beijing-Tianjin highway will thus be substantially secured. It is reported that in July, seven business-operated vehicles and vehicles from the Highway Bureau were seized by the Communist army on the Beijing-Tianjin highway. The Communist army claimed that all wheat or legal tender exceeding 100,000 yuan would be confiscated. Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist army's Ji-Re-Liao Military Region, protested to the U.S. through the CCP representatives at the Military Mediation Department regarding the Da Xia Sha He incident, claiming that U.S. troops had attacked the Communist army and providing four items as attachments: 1. U.S. troops dispatched armed U.S. soldiers to Xianghe three times in February and March to discuss repairing the Beijing-Tianjin highway with the Communist army. 2. On March 29, six armed U.S. soldiers shot and killed Yin Shizhong, staff officer of the 18th military sub-district of the Communist army, at Jiancun on the Beijing-Tianjin highway. 3. On April 1, five armed U.S. soldiers fired at the Communist army positions south of Matouzhen, Xianghe.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th Dispatch] News from transportation circles: More than 1,000 Communist troops attacked Yangcun Railway Station on the Beijing-Tianjin Railway at 10:00 PM last night. They retreated after a fierce battle of three hours. Although the Communist army from Xianghe withdrew, more than 3,000 Communist troops newly arrived from Jizhong have been deployed to Yangcun, Wuqing, and other places. It is reported that their purpose is to confront the National Army and ensure the Beijing-Tianjin transportation plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 4th Dispatch] It is widely believed that the Communist army's attack on the U.S. military on the Beijing-Tianjin highway has complex underlying motives. It is rumored that the U.S. military does not consider this incident closed. It is reported that the Communist army held an anti-American rally in Da Xia Sha He, the location of the incident, on the 25th. Four days later, the incident occurred. The Communist army unit involved in the incident was the 14th Regiment, which has now been reorganized into special task battalions and has fled Xianghe.</p>
<h3>Zhou Zhirou Arrives in Kuling; Reports to President on Dispatching Planes to Yan'an; Shows Photos to Reporters Explaining the Facts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] General Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, arrived in Kuling at 6:00 PM today and stayed at Room 65 of the Xianyan Hotel at No. 94 Zhonglu. He then met with reporters from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiujiang at 6:30 PM, confirming that the Air Force had sent planes to Yan'an to bomb and destroy the detained plane. Zhou came to Kuling to report on this matter to President Chiang. He originally planned to stay for a few days, but due to pressing matters in Nanjing, he will return to Nanjing within a day or two. Zhou brought enlarged versions of photos taken at an altitude of 2,000 meters over the Yan'an airport after the plane was destroyed. He asked Minister Peng Xuepei to show them to the reporters at the Xianyan Hotel tonight to explain the facts. The photos were very clear. The Yan'an airport, with an 800-meter runway, was located in a small, desolate valley, and the detained plane was parked 200 meters away from the airport. Peng stated that the government's sole purpose in sending planes to Yan'an was to destroy the detained plane, so no other losses or injuries were caused except for the plane itself. The motive for destroying the plane was for the sake of a peaceful future, because the Communist Party had been constantly abusing the weapons it had taken from the enemy and puppets after the Japanese surrender, and oppressing the people. Chinese and foreign people in Kuling have agreed to this point, believing that this action was normal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Regarding the "Bombing of Yan'an," the Communist Party will use this as a major propaganda point. Zhou Enlai is currently drafting a so-called "protest statement," which has not yet been completed. The method of delivery is also unknown.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Returns to Nanjing; Completes Inspection in Henan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi flew to Xinxiang by special plane a few days ago and stayed for several days. He returned to Nanjing by plane at 4:30 PM yesterday. Minister Bai told reporters that he had inspected the 31st and 4th Army Groups. After reorganization, the quality and combat effectiveness of the National Army have improved, and their morale is high. They are particularly interested in technical training. Bai was very satisfied with the results of the inspection.</p>
<h3>Tragedy at Beiping Airport</h3>
<p>Two Planes Burned Down Before Takeoff</p>
<p>Seven Killed and Over Twenty Injured on the Spot</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th Dispatch] (Delayed) A major tragedy occurred at Beiping Nanyuan Airport this morning. Two P-25 planes suddenly exploded with two loud bangs before taking off. Both planes were completely destroyed. Fortunately, several planes lined up next to them were not affected. Seven people were killed on the spot, including two pilots, two radio operators, and other technicians. More than 20 people were injured.</p>
<h3>National Air Force Divided into Five Military Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 4th Dispatch] In order to facilitate the command of the National Air Force, the authorities have decided to divide it into five military regions. Yan Wangcong, commander of the Fifth Military Region, has flown from Kunming to Chongqing to prepare for the establishment of the Chongqing Military Region headquarters. Before leaving, Yan said that the headquarters would establish a command post in each of Kunming, Chongqing, and Chengdu in order to maintain contact. The personnel for each unit have reportedly been decided.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Stationed in Tianjin Escape with Guns and Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 5th Dispatch] At 11:00 PM on the 4th, in the former Italian Concession in Hedong, Tianjin, a U.S. soldier suddenly ran out of the U.S. military camp carrying a submachine gun. First, he shot and killed a guard, then fled to Sanmin Road, where he shot and killed our on-duty police officer Qiu Yinsheng. U.S. military police and the Tianjin Police Department jointly surrounded and arrested him. The U.S. soldier resisted arrest and was shot and killed at 1:00 AM. He was not captured alive. The motive for the crime is unknown. (Note: According to a United Press Tianjin dispatch, the U.S. soldier had a sudden outbreak of mental illness and jumped over the wall to escape.)</p>
<h3>Gillem Issues Statement Correcting Previous Remarks</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Local Dispatch] Lieutenant General Gillem, Commander of U.S. Forces in China, issued a statement today denying that he told the Central News Agency reporter last Saturday that the "American military authorities had lodged a strong protest with Yan'an regarding the Anping incident" as reported by Shanghai newspapers on the 5th.</p>
<h3>President Inspects Summer Camp; Expanded Commemoration Week Presided Over by Chen Cheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] President Chiang inspected the summer camp at around 10:00 AM on the 5th. He met with General Chen Cheng in the library. The responsible officials of the summer camp and Advisor Bell, who came to Kuling with Minister Peng Xuepei, returned to the residence at 12:10 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] President Chiang personally attended the Military News Review Conference's Commemoration Week at the Lushan Summer Camp at 10:30 AM this morning, instructing the political workers and officers above the squadron leader level in the summer camp for one hour.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng personally presided over the expanded Commemoration Week held by the Youth Corps Lushan Summer Camp on the morning of the 5th, and delivered an impromptu speech, emphasizing the significance of the summer camp and its responsibilities. The ceremony concluded at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th Dispatch] Central Committee members Cheng Tianfang and He Zhonghan arrived in Kuling at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. Cheng told this newspaper that he came at the invitation of the summer camp to lecture on "Social Construction" and will stay in Kuling for about three weeks.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Offensive in Su-Lu-Wan Thwarted; National Army Advancing in Various Counties; Military Official Describes Recent Situation</h3>
<p>[Qi Bao, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] Due to the intense military conflict between the National Army and the Communist Army in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui, we interviewed a military official to clarify the situation. The following is a detailed account of the recent war situation in that area:</p>
<p>National Army's Right Wing Advances on Two Routes</p>
<p>The National Army's right wing in northern Jiangsu, after recapturing Haian on the evening of the 2nd, is now advancing north on two routes. One route is advancing beyond Xiyang directly towards Libao, and the other route is advancing beyond Wangjiazhuang towards Fuan, which will cooperate with the National Army in Qintong to directly attack Dongtai. The main force of the Communist Army's New 1st Division has retreated to the Anfeng Liangdu area, resisting the National Army advancing north from Haian. The Communist Army's 6th Division and the 55th, 57th, and 61st Regiments of Liu Peishan's 7th Column have all withdrawn to the Mojiazhuang area, which the National Army is sweeping up. The National Army in Taixian crossed the port and Zou Zhuang by waterway, and after a fierce battle in Fudu, finally recaptured the Communist stronghold of Laoge. The area is 72 li from Taixian and 18 li from Zou Zhuang, and has great military value, as it can attack Sanduo Er Gou Yi Gou to the west, threatening Gaoyou, and can cooperate with the National Army in Shenjia directly to capture Dongtai.</p>
<p>Dongtai and Xinghua May Fall Soon</p>
<p>It is reported that the National Army's vanguard, after clearing the Communist Army near Laoge, advanced north, attacking the Shiliting at the gateway to Xinghua (10 li from Xinghua), and pointed northwest to control Sanlangmiao. Another army moved west, seized Da Duozhuang Henggang. Therefore, the Communist armies in Xinghua and Dongtai are already besieged by the National Army and may fall soon. The highway from Nantong to Rugao is unobstructed, and the highway from Rugao to Taixian is being repaired day and night. The highway from Yangzhou to Yizheng has been thoroughly destroyed by the Communist Army, so it will take some time before traffic can resume. The Communist Army Headquarters in Huaiyin is trying to salvage the precarious situation in the south and has sent Zhang Yunyi, Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army, to lead his troops south along the Grand Canal, reaching Shaobo and counterattacking Xiannvmiao. Part of the force landed in Sishui and headed along the highway to Xinghua and Dongtai to reinforce. It is expected that an unprecedented battle will break out south of Dongtai in the coming days.</p>
<p>National Army in Yangzhou Takes Advantage of Pursuit</p>
<p>The National Army in Yangzhou advanced along the Yang-Tian highway, recapturing Yangshouba and Sungongpu on the morning of the 3rd. Taking advantage of the situation, they pursued northwest and recaptured Dayiji on the 4th. Qinlan is already under the control of the National Army. The Yang-Tian highway will be open to traffic in due time. The Communist Army's Ganquan troops are currently gathering in the Gongdaoqiao Songjiaqiao area, all wearing civilian clothes, attempting to steal an attack on Yangzhou. The National Army in the Dayiji area and the National Army's left wing in northern Jiangsu, after capturing Xuyi and Tianchang, have advanced to Gaoyou and the Hongze Lake waterway. Part of the force crossed the river and entered Jiangba, pointing along the Hongze Lake Dam to Shunheji, which will cooperate with the National Army moving south from Suqian to encircle Siyang. The National Army advancing north from Suqian crossed Zhangzhuang and reached Shaodian, confronting the Communist Army across the Shuhe River. It will join forces with the National Army moving south from Xin'an and then jointly attack Shuyang, so that the Communist Army west of the Shuhe River, south of the Longhai Railway, east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and north of Suqian and Suining will be isolated.</p>
<p>Communist Army in Southern Shandong Attempts Reinforcement</p>
<p>After defeating eight regiments of the Communist Army, the National Army in Xuzhou is advancing southeast, starting to clear the Communist Army south of the Longhai Railway and gathering near Shuanggou. The Communist Army in Shandong Province has transferred more than 10,000 reinforcements from Feixian, Linyi, and Yixian, and is advancing along the Zaozhuang branch line, via the Taierzhuang Canal Station, to Shuyang, attempting to cooperate with the Communist Army in Guanyun to encircle Donghai and Xin'an, and maintain communications between Jiangsu and Shandong. In order to crush this Communist Army attempt, the National Army has transferred heavy troops from Xuzhou, advancing to Taierzhuang to cut off the canal highway at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong, so that the Communist Army moving south from Shandong will be blocked north of Taierzhuang, daring not to cross the line. The Communist Army has now fled to the Chexi Mountain Taohuaqiao area, still attempting to steal across the canal, cross the Longhai Railway, and reinforce northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Battle of Dangshan About to Break Out</p>

<h3>The Communist Troops' Retreat Westward is a Pre-planned Scheme; They Should Be Ordered to Withdraw from Shaanxi Province; Liu Zhi and Zhu Shaozhou Issue Statements</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] Regarding the westward retreat of the "Central Plains Military Region" troops of the Communist Army, and the repeated accusations from the Communist side against the National Army, Director Liu Zhi of the Pacification Headquarters here issued a statement to reporters, strongly refuting these accusations. He stated that in April, the Communist Party requested that the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops be moved to northern Jiangsu, citing a shortage of food in the area as the reason. The Wuhan Headquarters then borrowed 40 million yuan to purchase food, and the matter was settled. Unexpectedly, on May 2nd, the Communist representative, Mu Dingyi, claimed: "The 60,000 troops of the Central Plains Military Region under Li Xiannian are near Xuanhua Town and are being surrounded and attacked by 26 divisions of the government with 300,000 troops in four routes." Consequently, on the 7th of the same month, Minister Xu Yongchang, Communist representative Zhou Enlai, and American representative General Beedle Smith went to Xuanhua Town to inspect, and the result was that nothing of the sort had occurred, which is known to the world. At the same time as this southern incident, the situation in the Northeast was also well known. The Communist Party's request to move the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops to northern Jiangsu, which borders Shandong, was a base for communist disruption in the Northeast. It was a clear attempt to place these communist troops on a springboard to the Northeast, with the greatest conspiracy. The authorities refused their request because, on the one hand, they did not want to exacerbate the chaos in the Northeast, and on the other hand, they wished to implement military reorganization within the existing garrison areas according to Order No. 3. This painstaking effort was not understood by the Communist Party even after the situation in the Northeast gradually eased. On June 29th, the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops crossed the railway and retreated westward, poisoning the borders of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. Two points should be especially emphasized here. First, a month before this incident, Han Dongshan's troops of the "Central Plains Military Region" Communist Army had already retreated westward. The Hankou group held several rounds of consultations to urge the communists to return to their original garrison area, but to no avail, which clearly showed their unwillingness to abide by the agreement. Second, during this incident, the "Jianghan Military Region" Communist Army, originally stationed in the Qing'an area, and the communist troops pre-positioned near Xinyang, rose up in response and retreated westward together. This indicates a pre-planned operation. The "Central Plains Military Region" Communist troops initially requested to move to northern Jiangsu and ultimately retreated westward. At first hearing, it seems incomprehensible, but in reality, it is a consistent action, aiming to create widespread internal chaos. When they requested to move to northern Jiangsu, they intended to aggravate the turmoil in the Northeast, and then trigger a nationwide war. Now, their retreat towards the borders of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Sichuan is aimed at attracting all the National Army in the Central Plains to this treacherous mountainous area, in order to achieve their ambition of launching internal chaos at any time. Although the circumstances and timing are different, their intentions to undermine peace are consistent. However, the communist troops attacked the National Army and local defense forces along the way, and for self-defense, they had to retaliate, resulting in casualties. Moreover, many subordinates of the Communist Party are extremely dissatisfied with their treacherous and treasonous acts and have voluntarily defected. Therefore, those who retreated to the areas of Shanyang and Zhushan on the border of Shaanxi and Hubei numbered less than 4,000 in total.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] Since the arrival of the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups in Xi'an, the mediation efforts have attracted much attention from all parties. This reporter visited Chairman Zhu Shaozhou on the 4th to inquire about this matter. Zhu stated that he had not yet met with the representatives of the groups, but regarding Li Xiannian's troops' incursion into Shaanxi, Zhu stated that since the Military Affairs Commission ordered Shaanxi Province in 1940 to designate Yan'an and ten other counties in northern Shaanxi as the food collection area for the Eighteenth Group Army, the remaining counties were not garrisoned by the Communist Army. During the War of Resistance, no inch of land in this province fell into enemy hands, and the National and Communist armies did not fight the enemy in the province, which is completely different from other provinces with so-called liberated areas. This time, Li's troops disobeyed orders and entered Shaanxi without authorization, disrupting peace, and there is no justification for it. The executive groups should notify Li Xiannian himself and his subordinates to leave Shaanxi within a time limit, in accordance with the provisions of the Political Consultative Conference's military reorganization plan, so that the people of Shaanxi will not suffer from their calamity. I have followed the Supreme Authority's intentions of seeking peace through compromise and have telegraphed all county magistrates to protect the people and await a resolution.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Ravage Counties in Hubei and Anhui; Authorities are Preparing for Emergency Relief; Public Servants and Educators in Anhui Province Donate Salaries for Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Anlu, Yingcheng, Huang'an, Yingshan, Qingfu, and Lishan counties have been ravaged by the communist troops for the longest time and have suffered the most. Now that the communist troops have retreated westward, these counties have been recovered one after another. The central government, concerned about the suffering of the disaster victims, has ordered the authorities here to use the recovered supplies to quickly provide emergency relief to the disaster areas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 5th] After more than ten counties in northeastern Anhui were occupied by the communist troops, the people fled in large numbers. Currently, more than a million people are stranded in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and in Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places. The situation is extremely miserable. Various agencies and organizations in the provincial capital have decided to establish a refugee relief association and set up branches in various places to conduct fundraising. Public servants and educators throughout the province will donate salaries: five days' salary for those in senior positions, two days' salary for those in intermediate positions, and one day's salary for those in junior positions. The provincial government will first advance 50 million yuan for emergency relief.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of National Defense Executed Corrupt Naval Officer Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Lifts Ban</h3>
<p>Allowing the Organization of Associations and Labor Unions</p>

The associations allowed to resume operations include the Hezuo Workers' Union, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Textile Workers' Union, and the Teahouse Workers' Union. It is noted that teahouse workers recently discussed strike issues. Labor unions have been quite active in the past two months, encouraging several destructive strikes, including strikes at the electricity company, the tram company, the gas company, and the shipyard. The strike at the ferry company has entered its second week since the British military abandoned its attempt to manage the ferries.</p>
<h3>Aerial Observation of Northern Jiangsu; The Reality of Communist Troops Damming the River; Thousands of Miles of Flooded Land is Heartbreaking</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The actual situation of the communist troops damming the river in northern Jiangsu, according to the results obtained from aerial observation, is as follows: (1) Near the Grand Canal in Xin'an Town, southwest of Haizhou, a huge breach 30 meters wide was seen, with floodwaters pouring straight down. (2) The breach of the Houmu River north of Shuyang is very large. The river surface and the land are merged into one, with thousands of miles of flooded land. Only the small highland of Qinglong Mountain is exposed. Residents have brought their belongings to the only rooftops and are temporarily living there. (3) The breach at the Grand Canal station on the Longhai Line near Xuzhou is the same situation as above. (4) The water level in the area west of Gaoyou Lake near the northeastern corner of Tianchang is flooded, possibly due to a breach upstream, or due to flooding of the waters of Hongze Lake and Gaoyou Lake. However, the water is turbulent, houses are drifting, and it is heartbreaking to witness. If the water level continues to rise, the disaster will be even more unthinkable.</p>

<h3>Economic Report by Wang Yunwu at the Central Memorial Week This Morning; Difficulties in Bidding and Resuming Work are Being Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 5th, presided over by Vice President Weng Wenhao.

<h3>Supplies Stored in Shanghai Warehouses; The UNRRA is Intensifying Clearance; The Problem of Inland Transport is Also Being Vigorously Improved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A spokesman for the UNRRA stated that UNRRA has not yet received any notification regarding the cancellation of the order issued on July 9th to suspend the shipment of supplies to China. However, UNRRA has decided to clear the heavy machinery and building materials stored in the warehouses in this city. UNRRA personnel responsible for managing the docks and warehouses are working day and night to intensify their work. The factory where UNRRA assembles this machinery is also operating day and night. Most of this machinery is surplus military equipment that has been used, and it takes a lot of effort to repair. It is especially difficult when parts are incomplete, so they have to be manufactured themselves or even re-ordered from abroad. After the assembly is complete at UNRRA's machine factory inside Jinan University in Zhenru, it is very difficult to transport the machinery because of its huge weight.</p>
<p>Regarding the inland transport of supplies, the spokesman pointed out that in the past, UNRRA faced many technical difficulties in carrying out this work. Beforehand, they did not know when the cargo ship would arrive, and they often had no idea what kind of supplies were being loaded. Therefore, UNRRA has requested UNRRA Director Ruggardiyar to remedy this, and reforms are being vigorously sought here. UNRRA has now agreed to notify the UNRRA Washington office of all relevant information each time a shipment is made. All food, transportation equipment, and machinery are inspected by UNRRA personnel before shipment, and then a certificate guaranteeing the suitability of the goods is delivered to the UNRRA office in China, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past of damaged supplies and unusable machinery. In addition, in order to avoid congestion of supplies at Shanghai docks, UNRRA is considering using smaller ships so that unloading can also be done at smaller docks.</p>

<p>Minguang: Work Begins to Eradicate Locust Hoppers</p>
<p>Recently, a large number of locust nymphs have been discovered in various villages under the jurisdiction of Xiaolin Township in this county, causing significant harm to the rural areas. Mr. Wang Wenzhong, a member of the Locust Control Work Team of the Anhui Special Envoy Branch of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Minguang from Bengbu to preside over and supervise the public in the work of eradicating locust nymphs. The work has already been launched and is being handled.

<p>Ningbo: Proposal to the Central Government to Establish Siming County</p>
<p>The Siming Mountains, which are adjacent to the three counties of Yin (county), Fenghua, and Cixi in the sixth district and the four counties of Yuyao, Shangyu, Xinchang, and Sheng (county) in the third district, cover a vast area with overlapping mountains. Bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, and the people who suffer from their poison are innumerable. It is inconvenient for each county to govern. I sincerely fear that if this continues, the future of public security will be worrying. The provincial government previously proposed to open up another county to facilitate governance. It ordered the commissioners of the third and sixth districts to survey the situation and prepare a plan for review. Now, it has been approved by the Provincial Administrative Conference to decide to open up another county. It is recommended to the Central Government to name it Siming County. Before it is approved, a pacification agency may be established first, and the commissioners of the third and sixth districts have already been ordered to conduct a long-term survey and prepare a plan for review.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei's Eldest Son's Case of Joining the Enemy: Trial Opened Yesterday at the Nanjing High Court; Confessed to Joining the Enemy Due to "Father-Son Relationship"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Wang Jingwei's eldest son, Wenying's, case of joining the enemy opened in the investigation court of the Capital High Court at 9:00 a.m. today, presided over by Judge Ge Zhaotang. The defendant confessed: In June of the 29th year (1940), he entered the puppet Executive Yuan as a recommended compiler. In the 29th year, he served as the colonel section chief of the first section of the third department of the puppet Military Commission. In the spring of the 30th year, he was promoted to major general as acting director of the third department. In the winter of the 30th year, he acted as the director of the military supplies department of the puppet General Directorate of Logistics, and then served as the director. In April of the 34th year, he served as the permanent deputy minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry. During his tenure in the puppet position, he assisted young people in entering the interior and underground workers sent by the central government to Nanjing and Shanghai. He also stated: His service in the puppet organization was due to his father-son relationship with Wang Jingwei. After his father's death, he did not firmly resign from the puppet position and admitted to a great mistake. He sincerely wished to have the opportunity to serve the country again, but refused to criticize his father's behavior and thoughts. Regarding property, he only knew that his mother had a western-style house each in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Lushan, and Nanjing. He himself only had more than a dozen suitcases, which had been sealed. At this point, the court ordered him to repent deeply and announced that the trial would resume on the 26th.</p>

<h3>The New Significance of Promoting Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>In today's Shanghai market, which is flooded with imported goods, the national goods promotion parade and the promotion of domestic goods movement jointly organized by our newspaper and more than 40 major manufacturers are launched at this moment, and their significance is profound. Using domestic goods is originally the national duty of the people. This not only suffices to block the alarming annual trade deficit, but also suffices to support the development of our infant industry. We have had a movement to promote domestic goods not only since today, but our promotion of domestic goods today is in fact deeply urgent. Due to the unrest in the domestic situation and the influx of foreign goods, China's domestic goods production industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. Today, our promotion of domestic goods is not only to awaken us to the habit of using domestic goods, but also to awaken us to pay attention to the current crisis in our country, to think of ways to resolve these crises, and to enable our infant industry to develop healthily. In other words, today our promotion of domestic goods is not entirely aimed at promoting the consumption of domestic goods, but more at improving the production of domestic goods.</p>
<p>To improve the production of our domestic goods, in a negative sense, we must eliminate all factors that hinder the improvement of domestic goods production. In a positive sense, we must create all the favorable conditions that enable the production of domestic goods to be improved. Under the extremely unfavorable conditions of numerous obstacles to domestic goods production, the shrinking and stagnation of the domestic goods production industry may lead our entire infant national industry to extinction. By that time, it may be too late for us to promote domestic goods again. Therefore, today we promote domestic goods, we must especially create a good and healthy environment for the domestic goods production industry so that it can grow and develop.</p>
<p>Indeed, the various obstacles that stand in the way of today's domestic goods production industry are mainly inseparable from the survival of the entire Chinese nation. The communist party's separation and rebellion have made it impossible for domestic transportation to recover smoothly, which affects the circulation of commercial goods. The unrest in the local areas has also reduced the consumption of domestic goods. In addition, the instability of currency values ​​and the massive dumping of foreign goods have all made the domestic goods production industry face serious difficulties. The resolution of these crises must be sought in the clarification of the overall situation. Only when the overall situation in China can be bright and stable can China's domestic goods production industry be bright and stable. Therefore, when we call for the resolution of the crisis in the domestic goods production industry, the first thing we think of is the communist party's military problem. Because of the communist party's obstruction, transportation has not recovered and a unified situation has not been achieved. As a result, the government has not been able to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis, such as the consolidation of the monetary system, etc., so that domestic economic life can gradually become stable. We can understand why the government has not been able to take any active measures to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>However, understanding that the government has not been able to take any active measures to fundamentally resolve the current economic crisis does not exonerate the government from its responsibilities. Some of the current crises are indeed related to the overall situation, but some crises indicate that the government lacks a firm policy and that the government's measures are inappropriate. In the latter case, we see that the imported goods, especially luxury consumer goods, that flood the domestic market are sufficient to indicate that the government does not have a policy to protect domestic industry, resulting in cheap and high-quality imported goods flooding the market. Today, when we promote domestic goods, the first thing we want to ask the government is to clearly define a policy to protect domestic industry and make good use of it. At present, in order to protect our infant industry, our international trade must not be completely left to its freedom, and strict control should be adopted. The government has already used tariff policies to prohibit the import of certain luxury goods, but some non-essential goods that are not listed as luxury goods are now flooding in large quantities, and even with the addition of tariffs and freight, they are still lower than the cost of domestically produced goods. Under such circumstances, how can domestic goods industry not suffocate to death? Due to the excessively high domestic production costs, the crackdown on this type of imported goods can no longer be completely carried out using tariff policies. In the case of ad valorem taxation, because the price of the goods themselves is low, even with the addition of high import taxes with a crackdown meaning, they are still cheaper than domestic goods, resulting in the failure to achieve the practical effect of the crackdown. We cannot allow this situation to develop naturally for a long time.</p>
<p>Secondly, what makes our production industry feel difficult is the excessively high bank discount interest, which makes it impossible for them to breathe. The operation of the production business, from the purchase of raw materials to the sale of finished products, requires the turnover of working capital in every aspect. In the current situation where the discount interest is one or even two jiao or more, how can the production business not feel shrunken? In supporting our domestic goods production industry, we hope that the government can effectively crack down on usury so that they can lend necessary funds at lower interest rates, so that the production business can gradually become lively.</p>
<p>All of the above, such as the crackdown on usury and the control of import trade, are originally things that the government should do. In the current stage where the domestic situation has not yet been clarified, if we want to rectify the current economic crisis, get to the root of the problem, and make thorough improvements, it may not be allowed by the situation. However, measures to treat the symptoms cannot be delayed. Leaving a little vitality for the domestic goods production industry is leaving a little vitality for the national economy.</p>

<h3>Regulations Committee Engaged in Heated Debate; Voting System Still Undecided; British Compromise Plan Rejected by Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcasting: If no decision can be made on the voting issue at the meeting this afternoon, the Chairman of the Regulations Committee, Spaak, will allow another meeting to be held tonight. All representatives feel that procedural issues must be resolved quickly in order to start the main work of the peace conference. In today's debate, the Soviet Union and its supporting countries demanded a two-thirds voting method, but the British amendment, which provides that some issues be passed by two-thirds and others by a majority, is likely to be accepted in the end.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcasting: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today rejected the British compromise plan on the voting issue, believing that this violated the resolution of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He believes that it is necessary to follow the two-thirds majority principle, but proposed that the delegations of various countries have the right to make recommendations to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcasting: At the Regulations Committee, the New Zealand representative, Jordan, gave a sarcastic speech, saying: "If the conference adopts a two-thirds majority voting system, then the great powers do not have to talk about democracy, because this voting system is enough to prevent the conference from achieving anything. If this method is adopted, then we might as well pack our bags and go home." The representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland followed the representatives of Yugoslavia in making speeches, supporting the two-thirds voting system, but the representatives of New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, Australia, and Brazil all expressed their opposition. The British representative put forward a compromise amendment, which was seconded by the US representative. If Molotov insists on the original proposal, he is likely to fail. Bernaldez asked the four major powers to hold a foreign ministers' conference at the same time to consider the draft treaty recommendations at the peace conference immediately to avoid delays.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Paris, 4th: Regarding the majority voting issue, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt has expressed his opposition to the compromise plan put forward by the United Kingdom. Mr. Evatt told Reuters that this is tantamount to giving the four major powers a veto power. In other words, motions that are not agreed to by the four major powers cannot be accepted by the conference. This is the main veto power, and there is another veto power caused by the two-thirds majority rule, that is, if seven or eight countries unite, they can prevent the conference from amending the draft treaty. This is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Paris, 4th: The Paris Conference is about to enter its second week, and the issue of "majority voting" is still an obstacle to substantive discussion. Invitations for 21 countries to invite five former enemy countries to attend and state their opinions may also be issued next week. Representatives from the five countries are already in Paris, but the chief representatives are still waiting for formal invitations in their home countries. Albania, Egypt, Luxembourg, Mexico, Cuba, and other countries have also requested to participate in the peace conference. It is not yet known whether they will be able to get their wish. Most of the peace conference representatives believe that it would be good to allow Albania and other five countries to attend and state their opinions, but they should not be formal member states of the peace conference. Some believe that the Soviet Union should also attend to state its opinions on the Austrian-Italian border. The disputes that may arise regarding the content of the treaty include the issue of Trieste and the Italian colonies. Representatives of Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus have already hinted at this in the conference. Regarding the distribution of the Italian fleet, the naval experts of the four major powers still have no final agreement. They have classified the Italian ships into three levels, A, B, and C, but how to distribute them to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union cannot yet be resolved. The Soviet Union suggested using a lottery method, which was opposed by the United Kingdom. It is expected that this matter will be sent back to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion.</p>
<h3>Small Country Representatives Criticized One After Another; Bernath Defended; Listed Points of Disagreement in Draft Treaty, Said All Countries Have Opportunity to Make Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Paris, 4th: Some representatives have criticized the Paris Peace Conference as a formalistic meeting. US Secretary of State Bernath made a brief defense on this point at a press conference tonight and listed 26 issues in the draft treaty that the four major powers have not agreed on, which need to be decided by the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Paris, 4th: Authoritative sources say: Bernath said that the 17 small countries will have the opportunity to make recommendations on the 32 issues that the four foreign ministers have not resolved, including (1) the determination of the Italian-Yugoslav border and the Trieste issue, (2) the status of the Trieste regime, (3) Italian reparations to countries other than the Soviet Union, (4) the issue of free navigation on the Danube, (5) the border issue in the Bulgarian treaty.</p>
<p>[French News Agency] Paris, 4th: US Secretary of State Bernath told reporters from our agency that the peace conference has made progress in the first week, which has exceeded our expectations, especially the Regulations Committee has achieved significant results. Representatives of various countries have publicly expressed their opinions. The main goal of this peace conference is to allow representatives of various countries to express their opinions as much as possible. Therefore, I believe that the four major powers should give priority to the other 17 countries in expressing their opinions on the draft treaty, because they did not participate in the drafting of the treaty. Only in this way can it be considered equal. I want to make the Luxembourg Palace an open forum where all participating countries can express their opinions. I do not want the world to say that this peace conference is another conference of the four major powers, but a conference of the 21 countries, or even a conference of the 17 countries. I am also happy to say that the United States will fully support all the recommendations passed by the conference with a two-thirds majority to ensure their implementation. I requested that the chairmen of the five committees drafting the treaty be filled by representatives from countries other than the four major powers, which is also the reason. In short, we should always provide convenience to small and medium-sized countries, no matter what. Some people think that it is a mistake to replace the plenary meeting with a small group committee to discuss the treaty. The final recommendations adopted by the conference must be approved by the plenary meeting.</p>
<h3>Alexander Acting British Chief Representative</h3>
<p>Bevin Will Go to Paris Soon</p>
<p>[Reuters] London, 4th: 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, announced: Prime Minister Attlee has decided to appoint Naval Secretary Alexander as the acting British Chief Representative to the Paris Peace Conference. It is expected that Foreign Minister Bevin will attend the Cabinet meeting in London this week and then go to Paris as the British Chief Representative. Bevin's spirits are getting better day by day. Attlee exchanged general opinions with Bevin immediately after returning to the country yesterday.</p>
<h3>Internationalization of Trieste; Drafting of Management Regulations</h3>
<p>Experts from Four Countries Dream Different Dreams</p>
<p>[United Press] Paris, 4th: After the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union decided to make Trieste an international port, they sent experts to organize a committee to draft the port's management regulations. According to reliable sources, experts from the four countries are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams and will submit different reports to the peace conference. Soviet experts support Yugoslavia's request to be in charge of management matters. Experts from France, Britain, and the United States advocate that since Trieste has been designated as an international port, the chairman of the port government should be borne by a country that is politically neutral. At the same time, people in Trieste are now speculating whether the port will actually live up to its name and become a center for merchants and travelers, or degenerate into a "ghost area." Most of the Allied soldiers and civilians also believe that it is either one or the other, and the key lies in whether it is handled properly.</p>
<h3>Cuba Requests to Participate in the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Paris, 4th: It was learned here today that Cuba has formally requested the four major powers to allow it to participate in the 21-nation peace conference. Cuban Minister Ayala submitted a note signed by Cuban Foreign Minister Alvarez to the representatives of the four major powers, stating that Cuba had declared war on the Axis powers and had signed the United Nations Declaration, so it should be allowed to participate in the meeting. Cuba is the second Latin American country to request participation in the peace conference. Mexico made the request before the peace conference convened, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly to Convene Next Month; Preparations Underway; Provisional Agenda Sent to Member States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 4th] The United Nations General Assembly will be held in Lake Success starting September 23rd, with the session potentially lasting six to seven weeks. During this time, the various committees will hold between 300 and 400 meetings. A special committee, chaired by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie's assistant, Cordier, is currently preparing the work plan for the General Assembly. It holds meetings six days a week, including evening sessions, and will make recommendations on the meeting content for the General Assembly and its various committees. All of this will be publicly broadcast by newspapers and radio. In the first week, the heads of delegations from various countries will deliver speeches to the General Assembly, after which the six main committees will separately discuss the agenda drafted by the General Committee. Finally, each committee will submit reports and resolutions to the General Assembly for discussion in plenary session.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 4th] The United Nations Headquarters has just released the provisional agenda for the General Assembly, which has now been sent to the 51 member states. The key points of the provisional agenda include consideration of Security Council recommendations, the admission of new member states, discussion of Australia's proposal to reconsider the voting method of the Security Council, consideration of India's proposal to discuss the treatment of people of Indian origin in South Africa. According to the provisional agenda, after the opening ceremony of the General Assembly, the report of the Nominations Committee will follow, electing the staff of the General Assembly and discussing the provisional agenda. The Secretary-General will then report on the rules of procedure and proposed changes, followed by the Secretary-General's report on the working situation of the United Nations organization, which will then be followed by the report of the Security Council. After the General Assembly discusses the issue of admitting new member states, it will then elect three non-permanent members of the Security Council and six members of the Economic and Social Council. This will be followed by discussions on trust territory agreements, the permanent location of the United Nations Headquarters, administrative and budgetary issues, and the obligations of member states. Following that will be the report of the United Nations, outlining the global grain shortage, the economic reconstruction of war-torn areas, and the resettlement of refugees. The General Assembly will then consider various agreements with designated agencies and discuss the transfer of former League of Nations institutions to the United Nations. Finally, the General Assembly will discuss treaty registration, as well as the Indian and Australian proposals, and the proposed 1946-47 United Nations budget. At the same time, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has prepared a detailed report to be submitted to the General Assembly, outlining the progress of the United Nations, stating that although the progress of the United Nations may not be entirely satisfactory, there is no reason for disappointment. He said that the United Nations is based on a major assumption, namely that the permanent members of the Security Council will reach agreement on major issues. Lie also said, "The veto" illustrates the obligation of the permanent members to reach agreement on their own.</p>

<h3>Former "Millard's Review" Editorial Writer Powell Testifies; Far East Tribunal Discovers Secret Japanese Documents Proving the Foreign Ministry Knew About the Conspiracy to Invade China</h3>
<p>[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] The Far East International Tribunal heard testimony today from Powell, the last witness to the Northeast Incident and former editorial writer for the "Millard's Review" and the "Chicago Tribune," describing the situation at the time of the September 18th Incident. He stated that in 1931, in order to report on the situation of the Northeast Incident, he and a group of American journalists arrived in Shenyang on September 23rd, at which time the city was completely occupied by the Japanese army, and Doihara had been appointed "Acting Mayor of Shenyang." When meeting with Doihara, piles of railway wreckage were visible in front of the Japanese army headquarters, which was quite shocking. Doihara explained that this railway wreckage was from the bombing of the Liutiao Lake section of the South Manchuria Railway and showed photographs of the area, showing that the area had been cleaned up, the damaged location had been replaced with new rails, and two sleepers had also been replaced. Upon closer inspection, there was no evidence to be found. Fifty to one hundred meters away from the bombed railway track, there were three bodies of Chinese soldiers, who were said to have been attempting to escape after bombing the railway, but there were no bloodstains on the bodies. While in Shenyang, he had purchased many photographs of groups of Japanese people wearing ordinary clothes, with armbands, holding guns. The armbands read "Zaikōgunjin," meaning reservists. According to US consular officials and foreigners, several days before the incident, many people were wearing these armbands. The deputy manager of the Far East of Standard Oil indicated to me a Japanese military camp and what appeared to be a warehouse, saying that the building contained heavy artillery and heavy artillery shells, which were brought in under the guise of mining machinery. At the time, when reporters sent telegrams, they had to present their press passes. Initially, there were no obstructions, but later there were some restrictions, and they were monitored by military police. Although he had not personally witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese in the Northeast, there were frequent reports, one of which was published in "Millard's Review," in which the Japanese, on the pretext that the village was hiding Russian guerrillas, killed as many as 3,000 people in a certain village in the Northeast. Because the area was blockaded by the Japanese army, it was impossible to go there to investigate, but according to Chinese and foreign missionaries, this was indeed the case. Powell then went on to describe General Ma Zhanshan, saying that he had met Ma twice. After the battle of Jiangqiao, Ma burned bridges to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, retreating towards Qiqihar, and then retreating along the Hinggan Mountains towards Aigun. As a result of negotiations with Doihara, General Ma Zhanshan had taken up the post of Minister of the Army of the puppet Manchukuo, but upon returning to Shanghai, he sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, saying that he had accepted the post of Minister of the Army of the puppet Manchukuo and had accepted five million yuan in gold bars from the Japanese army, but that he had delayed negotiations with Doihara and had entered Soviet territory from Aigun, moving westward, and had rejoined the National Army. He is still a loyal Chinese and is currently in Baotou, etc.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] The International Tribunal discovered secret Japanese documents, revealing that the Japanese Foreign Ministry had prior knowledge of the invasion plan, while claiming ignorance to the outside world. This document proves that Japan had deliberately seized foreign capital to operate businesses in China, in order to supply Japan's war machine. The Japanese Navy, which often publicly condemned the Army's hostile actions in China, also proved to have actively participated in the invasion as early as 1936. The Japanese Cabinet's southward advance policy also proved to have started in 1936, not 1940.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Earthquake in Central America</h3>
<p>[News Agency, New York, 4th] The seismological observatories of Fordham University in New York State and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena detected yesterday afternoon at 5:57 PM Greenwich Standard Time (11:51 PM Shanghai time) "the most severe earthquake in history, the magnitude of which caused the recording paper to run out." Experts believe that the epicenter of the earthquake was in the Caribbean Sea, near the coast of Venezuela. If it had been closer to densely populated areas, the loss of life and other damage would have been enormous. The earthquake had not completely stopped until 12:30 AM this morning. A California scientist said that this earthquake "was not as severe as the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906."</p>
<h3>International Christian Conference Opens Yesterday in Cambridge, England; Sixty Delegates from Various Countries Attend</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Cambridge, England, 4th] The International Christian Conference opened today, lasting for four days. Dulles, an advisor to the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, served as chairman and delivered a speech stating that although the world's moral and spiritual strength is insufficient, a just and lasting peace can still be achieved. He also asked the sixty attending delegates to discuss the extremely tense situation between the Soviet Union and Western countries, saying that even if no conclusion is reached, it is not a problem. This urgent situation did not begin today and should not be daunting. The situation between major powers is often very tense, but it has always been hidden, and now it is being fully vented. Although Dulles advocated that the meeting should be open to the public, there would still be several closed meetings.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] Eight Christian churches issued a declaration today, advocating unified action with the Catholic Church on world issues, to establish a certain degree of satisfactory understanding at the highest level, which roughly refers to the World Council of Churches and the Roman Curia. This proposal was announced by the Secretary-General of the United Christian Council, Kirk. All churches support this plan.</p>

<h3>Visiting the TVA in Knoxville, Visiting the Former Residence of the Great Writer Mark Twain (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>I regret that I did not encounter such an experience on my way to Tennessee. Like everyone else, the white people's train was quiet and orderly. As the train entered Kentucky, it gradually entered the mountainous area. Because there were many upward slopes, the train speed was very slow. From Kentucky to Tennessee, my impression of this route was no different from the mountainous areas of southwestern China. The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina are just like our Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang; however, they are in the southeast, and we are in the southwest. The Kentucky-Tennessee section of the Southern Railway Company is like our Guizhou-Guangxi Railway and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and also like the Beichuan Railway near Beipei. The train climbed up the hillside, winding through the mountain valleys, like a porter carrying a heavy load. Presumably, when it was built in the past, it was built to accommodate the mountains, with fewer tunnels, so it was not built like the Swiss mountain railway, mostly made up of tunnels and bridges. From Kentucky to Tennessee, I saw three large mountain tunnels and two small mountain tunnels. The large mountain tunnels only took two minutes to pass through. Every time the train passed through a mountain tunnel, the windows were covered with a gas like water droplets. I don't know if this gas is the so-called "miasma" of the southwestern mountains of China? The further south I went, the hotter the climate became. I changed trains twice in "Oak Ridge," a small town in central Tennessee, and turned east. Two hours later, I arrived in Knoxville, the central hub of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).</p>
<p>Knoxville is a typical small American town. Before the TVA, the population was only about 10,000. Now, Knoxville's population has exceeded 150,000. Many retired army and navy officers and soldiers asked for peacetime jobs, and the government introduced them to the TVA. Most of the enterprises in the United States are privately owned, and state-owned enterprises are very, very few. The TVA is a pioneering initiative of a large state-owned enterprise in the United States, and therefore, it has become the best place for the wartime government to settle veterans. Next door to the TVA's general office is the veteran registration office. Tennessee is surrounded by mountains, and Knoxville is a small plain between the mountains, like Tongliang and Hechuan in Sichuan. The capital of Tennessee is Nashville, and the state university of Tennessee is in Knoxville. The state university is famous for its agriculture. One of the three directors of the TVA, Harcourt Morgan, is the former president of the University of Tennessee and a well-known agricultural expert in the United States. Few Chinese students study in the southern United States. Mr. Dunford of the registration office of the University of Tennessee told me that a long time ago, there were Chinese students studying at the university. Now there is one female student and one male student named Zhang studying at the University of Tennessee. Mr. Zhang works at the TVA, specializing in learning about the TVA's water conservancy projects. Overseas Chinese are all over the United States, and Knoxville is no exception. Lao George, from Kaiping, Guangdong, owns a large laundry here and employs many Americans.</p>
<p>There are about ten overseas Chinese in the entire city of Knoxville. One of them has even opened a bookstore specializing in Western books. But, in any case, the Americans here are still unfamiliar with China. As I walked on the four or five main streets of Knoxville, I was often stared at by many unfamiliar eyes. The southern United States is relatively conservative, and their knowledge of overseas is not as "well-informed" as that of the north. Also, Southerners speak with a strong accent. It's still English, but it's harder to understand. The day after I arrived in Knoxville, I met Ms. Foster, a female reporter from the "Knoxville News Sentinel." She asked me, "Do you find the Southern accent hard to understand when you come to Tennessee?" I said yes. She said, "Even Americans from Chicago and New York often make many jokes because of language misunderstandings, let alone you are not American!" The newspaper was interested in China's plan to build the Yangtze River water conservancy project. The Knoxville "News Sentinel" published news and interviews about my arrival in Knoxville and also published my photo. Mr. Berthe, a judge of the Supreme Court of Belgium, who arrived the day before me, was also sent to inspect the TVA. The newspaper wanted to take a photo of him, but he said, "According to Belgian law, judges' photos are not allowed to be published." The next day, the newspaper used his words as the title of the news. There are two major newspapers in Knoxville, the "News Sentinel" is one of them, and the other is the "Knoxville Journal." The "News Sentinel" is one of the important local newspapers of the Howard Group. Originally, the "News" and the "Sentinel" were separate newspapers. The "Sentinel" was founded as early as 1886 and has been published for sixty years. The history of the "News" is relatively short. In 1941, the two newspapers officially merged. Currently, there are 175 employees in the entire newspaper, and about 30 in the editorial and interviewing department. I met their editor-in-chief, Mr. Miller, and photographer Mr. Anderson. The other newspaper is the "Knoxville Journal," with the headline on the cover: "The largest newspaper in the Tennessee Valley." It is known for its many photos. There is a full page of editorials every day. On the editorial page, there are different "wise sayings and ancient precepts" every day, many of which are excerpts from the Bible. Because my time was very short, I have not yet visited the Journal. In the southern United States, the weather is so hot in summer that it is suffocating. I live in a "Park Hotel" near the TVA's headquarters.</p>
<p>Mr. Schaeffer, who is in charge of receiving me at the TVA News Department, first asked me, "Is there a fan in the hotel room?" The TVA has new guests from various countries coming to visit almost every day. Therefore, the organizational structure of its "News Department" (or Consultation Department, Publicity Department, etc.) is large. Whenever a visitor or inspector comes, they prepare various materials and arrange the itinerary and program of the visit. They are experienced and methodical in doing this work. I stayed at the TVA for ten days. From the first day I met Mr. Henley, the deputy director of the News Department, my time was arranged as tightly as a middle school student attending class. When to go to the dam? When to watch a movie? (Movies about the TVA), and even when to go to the library to see reference books, were all arranged very tightly. The ten days were not an "enjoyable" inspection, but simply "training"! But no matter what, this kind of training life is lovely. Mr. Berthe, a Belgian judge, was the only classmate who "received training" with me. He often joked with the TVA staff, "It's enough to see, the TVA is so powerful!" (Knoxville News, July 12) -End- The Former Residence of Mark Twain in Hannibal City</p>

<p>(Report from this newspaper) Wan Lilang, the director of the puppet political security bureau, Chu Yapeng, the deputy director of the puppet investigation and statistics department, and Huang Xi, the director of the military affairs department of the puppet military and political department, and twenty-three other military traitors who served the enemy and puppets during the enemy-puppet period, were escorted from the Shanghai Temporary Prison to the Songhu Garrison Command yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to verify their identities before being tied to the Song Park execution ground and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Wan Lilang and others were originally underground workers of our military organs, but later they were lured by profit and betrayed us midway, selling themselves to the enemy. After serving in puppet posts, they repeatedly sabotaged our great cause of resisting Japan, harmed our workers, and even oppressed the people, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Their crimes are too numerous to mention. After the victory, they were successively captured by the relevant authorities and sentenced to death. The sentences were presented to Chairman Chiang for approval before execution.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding and False Alarm</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the prisoners were escorted to the garrison headquarters, they did not yet know that their last day had come and were calm, and some even carried replacement clothes and held folding fans. When they were being tied up, a reporter from a certain newspaper approached to get a closer look, and the soldiers mistakenly thought he was one of the prisoners. Ropes were put around his neck, but he shouted that he was a news reporter and was released. The plaza of the garrison headquarters was heavily guarded. When the prisoners were being identified and driven onto the prison truck, Chen Lu, one of the female prisoners, swayed and was dragged onto the truck by soldiers. Two trucks carrying the execution soldiers drove to the execution ground. The garrison headquarters also sent Section Chief Xu of the Military Law Department and Deputy Director Xu Zhongfen of the Shanghai Temporary Prison to the scene to supervise the execution. The list of all executed personnel is as follows: (1) First, the pseudo-positions provided and held by the colleagues are as follows:</p>

However, at that time, there was also a strike at the British Tramway Company, which was settled by giving each person a loan of 100,000 yuan. Chi Xiangnan then went to the Waterworks Industry Workers' Union office to negotiate and spread the news to the public, hoping to incite another strike. Zhou Fujiang immediately reported the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Garrison Command arrested and sent him to court, believing that he had committed a crime under Article 30 of the Coal Mining and Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations in Extraordinary Times, and prosecuted him. The defendant yesterday retained lawyer Zhai Bin to defend him and denied all the accusations. After investigation, the court adjourned the hearing for further questioning.</p>

<h3>The Garrison Command Cracks Down on a Counterfeit Money Manufacturing Organization: Confiscates Billions of Yuan in Counterfeit Money: Ten People Arrested in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Other Three Locations: Gunfight at Nanxiang: Printing Plates Engraved by Famous Masters</h3>
<p>At the end of last month, Feng Zhongda, section chief of the Garrison Command's Inspection Office, and deputy section chief Sheng Changfu, accidentally discovered a type of 2,000-yuan banknote of the Central Bank's 1945 edition. They immediately began an investigation and determined that the organization had branches in Suzhou, Nanxiang, and Shanghai. Sheng led a team to Suzhou on the morning of July 28th. After three days of investigation, they learned the location of the counterfeit money manufacturing organization. On the 30th, he returned to Shanghai to report and discuss the results. On August 3rd, Section Chief Feng and Deputy Section Chief Sheng personally led more than ten officers. Feng was responsible for the arrest work in Suzhou, while Sheng was responsible for the work in Nanxiang. Other officers were sent to Shanghai to wait for news from Suzhou and Nanxiang. Feng went to Suzhou on the 3rd. After deploying troops, they took action and arrested six principal offenders in Suzhou within half an hour. At the same time, two principal offenders were also arrested in Nanxiang on the same day. After Feng completed the work in Suzhou, he urgently telegraphed the personnel in Shanghai, instructing them to search for the secrets of the counterfeit money organization in the city, and immediately led personnel to Shanghai. As a result, the Shanghai branch was also cracked down, and two principal offenders were arrested. The ten principal offenders arrested in the three locations were escorted to the Garrison Command for legal action. However, several accomplices in Nanxiang are still at large and are being actively pursued. According to Section Chief Feng, counterfeiting money disrupts finance and is extremely harmful. He said he was pleased to report the case was solved within 36 short hours. As a result of the efforts of the department's personnel, more than 1.1 million yuan of counterfeit money was seized in the three locations, along with a large number of printing plates and machinery. After being printed, the counterfeit money had already been used in the Beijing-Shanghai area, Changzhou, and Nanxiang, totaling more than 3.1 million yuan. The unprinted counterfeit money was as high as five feet, totaling hundreds of millions of yuan. If the case had not been cracked yesterday, this money would have been printed and mixed into the market. The engraving work for the counterfeit money printing plates was done by the hand of a first-class national engraving master (whose name is expected to be released today). Before the war, the gift certificates of various banks in the city and the printing plates of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes during the occupation were all done by this person. Therefore, the printing of this counterfeit money, only the number of the banknote and the seal of the president are slightly blurred (not done by this person), and the rest of the printing is almost indistinguishable, making it extremely difficult to identify. The printing of the counterfeit money is divided into four plates, which have now all been seized. The internal organization of the counterfeit money organization is divided into (1) printing, (2) selling, and (3) using. As for the more than 30 million yuan of counterfeit money already used in the Beijing-Shanghai area, it was decided to find a way to recover it. In addition to printing counterfeit 2,000-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank's 1945 edition, the counterfeit money organization was also testing the color separation of 50-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes. This was also cracked down. Therefore, if the counterfeit money organization had not been cracked down one month later, the impact on the national financial community would have been self-evident.</p>
<p>Details of the Case Cracking</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command cracked down on a large-scale counterfeit money printing organization of the Central Bank in Nanxiang on the 4th of this month. The full truth of the case is explored below: In recent months, counterfeit 2,000-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank have been discovered in the Beijing-Shanghai area, appearing repeatedly and difficult to distinguish from the real thing. The Garrison Command dispatched a large number of personnel to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places for investigation, starting last month. After receiving a tip-off last month, Director Tao, under the instruction of Commander Xuan, ordered section chief Feng Zhongda (former commander of the Reconnaissance and Prevention Brigade) to assign personnel to work in Suzhou. Section Chief Feng ordered Deputy Section Chief Sheng Changfu to lead section chief Lu Zhengzhang, deputy section chief Li Zui, Zhou Jiaqi, Zhuang Yongji, and others to gather and go to Suzhou at 6:00 AM on July 29th. After opening room 321 at the Lexiang Hotel, they immediately planned the investigation and deployment strategy in the morning.</p>
<p>Based on the information provided by the original informant, it was known that the case was closely related to Zhang Jianliang, who lived at 117 Jingde Road, Suzhou. The original informant secretly identified Zhang and Yu Delong, who came with Zhang, by their facial features at the Red Star Tea House. Personnel were then dispatched to follow them, and they were seen going to Zheng Wenhuan's house at 48 Bifengfang. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang was seen with another man surnamed Qin at room 306 of the Lexiang Hotel. Zhou Jiaqi was sent to open another room, 304, to secretly monitor their actions. That night, they searched the room in conjunction with the local police局 and learned that the man surnamed Qin was named Rongchang, 36 years old, from Wuxi, and worked as a butcher in the meat market on Caishi Street in Shanghai (his room was guaranteed by Zhu Axiang, the owner of the Fulu Shou Caifan Restaurant in Suzhou). Since Qin and Zhang had dealings with each other, they were clearly one of the people involved in this case. That evening, the investigators took a bath at the Qingquan Bathhouse and learned from the tea room that Qin Rongchang, Zhu Axiang, and Zhang Jianliang were very close. At this point in the investigation, action steps were taken. On the morning of August 3rd, Section Chief Feng from Shanghai personally led chief members Si Baochun and Ling, and others to Suzhou to make arrangements. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang Jianliang was arrested at the Red Star Tea House. According to his confession, his accomplices were Zhu Axiang, Zheng Bohuan (also known as Wenhuan), Che Lanru, Han Boxun, Yu Delong, and others, who were jointly using and selling counterfeit money. They then separately arrested the offenders. Under further interrogation, it was learned that Qin Rongchang, who had come with Zhang Jianliang, was indeed one of the main offenders in this case. It was discovered that Qin had returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Lu Zhengzhang returned to Shanghai first thing on the morning of the 4th and arrested Qin at 57 Diandang Lane, Fangxie Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>According to Qin's confession, Bao Mouzhu was an important figure in this case and often sipped tea at the Datong Tea House. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, Vice-Section Chief Shi Weipu and others were dispatched to the Datong Tea House and arrested Bao. Bao confessed that the counterfeit money printing organization was located at Zhaijiazhai, No. 3 Bridge, Nanxiang. At 7:00 PM that evening, a large number of personnel were ordered to be led by Bao to the destination. Unexpectedly, the people in the counterfeit money printing organization dared to open fire to resist arrest, and a gunfight broke out between the two sides. As a result, Zhang Jinsheng and Huang Rongquan were arrested, and a wooden pistol, 18 bullets, and printing orders were seized. The two offenders and the seized items were escorted back to Shanghai at 9:00 PM. At 11:00 PM that afternoon, Qin and others went to the house of key offender Bao Jiasheng at 30 Yongshun Lane, Huaji Road, Hongkou, and seized on the spot one large and one small printing press, one pack of transparent paper, one pack of pigment, three copper plates, two triangular feet, and one pack of wax, which were all taken to the office.</p>
<p>The offenders arrested in the three locations in this case are as follows: Those arrested in Suzhou are: Zhu Axiang, from Wuxi (selling counterfeit money); Zhang Jianliang, from Suzhou (promoting counterfeit money); Zheng Bohuan, from Wuxi (manufacturing counterfeit money); Che Lanru, from Shanghai (receiving and using counterfeit money); Yu Delong, from Yixing (using counterfeit money); Han Boxun (Korean) (suspect). Those arrested in Shanghai are: Qin Rongchang, from Wuxi (the initiator of the counterfeit money printing in Suzhou); Bao Jiasheng, from Ningbo (in charge of raising counterfeit money copper plates). Those arrested in Nanxiang are: Zhang Jinsheng, from Wuxi (printing worker); Huang Rongquan, from Zhenhai (printing worker).</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Suzhou on the 5th] Recently, many counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the market, all of which are 2,000-yuan lotus green, and the imitation is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The Songhu Garrison Command received a tip-off that there was a counterfeit money promotion organization in Suzhou and sent Colonel Feng Zhongda of the Inspection Office and many officers to Suzhou on the 3rd. Based on the clues, they successively arrested Che Lanru, chief physician of Jianhua Hospital, Han Qiao Han Boxun, Zhang Jianmin, Yu Depang, Chen Wenhuan, Zhu Axiang, and other six people. 940,000 yuan of brand-new counterfeit banknotes were seized from the offenders. All the witnesses were escorted to Shanghai on the 4th for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Dance Star Guan Minli Participates in the Election</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper]</p>
<p>The elections for "Miss Shanghai" and various groups of "Stars" and "Queens" are rapidly unfolding with enthusiastic support from all walks of life. At the same time, the responsible authorities of the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Subei Refugee Relief Association made a solemn statement, stating that the motivation for this activity is entirely to provide relief to the disaster victims and is by no means a frivolous pastime. The fundraising target is 200,000,000 yuan. If all walks of life can uphold the spirit of human mutual assistance and the ancient precepts of disaster relief and neighborly love and enthusiastically participate and contribute to the cause, then this number can certainly be exceeded. Considering the severity of the disaster in Hunan and Henan, which is no less than that in Subei, the association has decided to allocate all the amount exceeding the target to Hunan, Henan, and other places.</p>
<p>According to the reporter, red dance star Miss Guan Minli (pictured) has already registered to participate in the dance girl group election. Miss Guan is 25 years old, from Wuxi, and is 5 feet 1 inch tall. Before the War of Resistance, she was a red star in dance halls such as Datong, Xianle, and Paramount. After the war, she went to Hong Kong, then to Guilin. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, she secretly came to Shanghai and joined the Metropolitan Dance Hall as a dance girl. Her residence also served as a liaison office for underground workers. Later, it was discovered by the enemy and puppets, and she left Shanghai again for Hong Kong, only returning to Shanghai last month. It is said that Miss Guan is scheduled to join the New Xianlin Dance Hall on the 8th.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of the Metropolitan Dance Hall manager embezzling the donation of dance girl Li Zhenzhen (previously mistakenly reported to be serving in MGM), the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Subei Refugee Relief Association sent someone to inquire about the truth from Mr. Rong, who purchased dance tickets for the original donation on that day. According to him, he only raised 300,000 yuan with a few friends on the night of the charity dance, and he did not purchase 1,000,000 yuan worth of tickets. Mr. Rong also wrote a statement in his own hand and handed it over to the association as evidence, and Li Zhenzhen has also denied the matter.</p>
<h3>Two Ships of the French Postal Company Bring in a Large Amount of Vietnamese Rice</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The French Postal Shipping Company has resumed shipping between China and Vietnam.

The Venipico Spake, managed by the foreign department of Jardine Matheson, brought coal from Pearl Harbor to China this time. It was originally scheduled to unload in Qingdao, but the hull was slightly damaged when passing through the Wusongkou, so it entered the port for repairs. The work has now been completed and is scheduled to leave for Qingdao today. The Si Fan Er Deng, managed by Shunheng Foreign Firm, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 9th, bringing a large amount of railway materials from the United States.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Security Has Been Actively Strengthened</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Two-Way Railway Administration, whom the reporter recently interviewed, the derailment of the Beijing-Shanghai passenger train in Zhoujing Lane on the 10th of last month was caused by the track spikes being pried off. Following this, two hand grenades were found in the postal compartment of the 9th passenger train at Nanjing Station on the 17th of last month. Based on the above two facts, it is clear that the rioters have planned to sabotage the trains on the two routes. The Railway Bureau has now actively strengthened the security of the railway.</p>

First, he briefly reviewed the work of the Ministry of Education in the past and then expressed his views on education, stating: Education should be coordinated with politics and should be centered on the Three Principles of the People, so that every citizen has the opportunity to receive education. Chinese education has always been centered on morality, with wisdom, benevolence, and courage combined to form morality. Chen also said: These three are the universal virtues, and the way to practice them is one. What is one? Sincerity. Sincerity is faith, wisdom, universal love, and strength. Where sincerity leads, even metal and stone will open. The task of education is to promote human compassion. Today's education, which cannot cultivate the virtue of loving others and cannot create ambitious youth, needs to be reformed. Chen also said: The first purpose of education is "control," the second purpose is "nurturing," and the third purpose is "safeguarding." Whether the future of the country is promising depends on whether the students of the future work hard, are disciplined, and have faith and strength. Education is omnipotent, depending on our aspirations. We should train students according to the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, so that future education will have a more great and brighter future. Chen's spirits were particularly good yesterday, and despite his high fever, he spoke fluently for as long as two hours. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

<p>The school resumed operations, and National Central University received priority. Starting on April 15th, the students boarded ships one after another and returned to Nanjing in batches. So far, six batches have arrived, totaling about 2,000 people, living in the Sipailou campus. The Sipailou, which had been quiet for a while, is gradually becoming lively.</p>
<p>The National Central University students who have returned to Nanjing are mostly engaged in work to pass the long summer vacation and earn some money. Some are helping the school, and some are working as civil servants in government agencies, earning tens of thousands of yuan a month, which is a small supplement to living expenses.</p>
<p>The National Central University Student Union, in order to provide students with spiritual food, has opened a reading room in a large room next to the Student Union office, with newspapers from all over the world readily available. Whenever they are free after meals, everyone goes to read the newspapers, and they are all delighted.</p>

<p>When the students were in Shapingba, they used to sit in teahouses when they had nothing to do. Nanjing does not have such facilities, so when they have nothing to do, they can only lie in bed and sleep or read novels.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Zongluo, the president of National Taiwan University and the director of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Academia Sinica, described it in detail in the month, especially praising the equipment of the agricultural and medical colleges.</p>
<p>Before the war, National Central University had very few teachers and students, but now it has increased three or four times. The original classrooms and dormitories are not enough. In order to solve this difficulty, the school authorities have contracted with merchants to build seven dormitories. The bidding has been completed, and construction is underway.

<h3>Recent News from Academia Sinica: Over a Hundred Researchers Already Working in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Director Wang Zhongji (Jiaji) of Academia Sinica told reporters that the institute's facilities had been largely destroyed by fire during the war. However, the seven institutes of mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, psychology, and medicine are now operating at the original site of the Japanese Natural Science Research Institute in front of Maple Bridge. The buildings there are spacious, the environment is beautiful, and all the arrangements are quite magnificent, truly a good place for scholars to conduct research with a clear mind. Currently, over a hundred researchers have returned to their positions and are busy sorting and categorizing the large instruments that have been taken over. Formal research work has not yet begun. In addition, there are over a hundred researchers in the capital at the five institutes of astronomy, meteorology, geology, history, linguistics, and sociology.

The institute's research work will be carried out in cooperation with various university graduate schools. However, detailed plans will be decided upon after the completion of the restoration and the holding of a council meeting.

<h3>Zhejiang's Education Funds Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Opera Stage Donation to Subsidize, Jiaxing Raising Small Chickens for Sale</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] The difficulty of funding education in Zhejiang Province can be said to have reached an extreme. Those in charge truly feel like "a clever housewife cannot cook without rice." Recently, local authorities have been finding ways to remedy the situation themselves. Otherwise, under the slogan of "education first," the results will be far inferior to what they were before. It is reported that in Shaoxing, since the victory, theatrical performances in villages and towns to thank the gods have been very popular. The council believes that using the county's opera stage donation, which is a part of the local entertainment donation, to subsidize the education funds of local elementary schools is very appropriate. The plan has now been decided and will be submitted to the county for approval before it can be implemented. At the same time, Min Hanzhang, a councilor from Yunshang Township in Jiaxing, in response to the call for raising education funds, came up with a more unconventional method: initiating the raising of small chickens by distributing them to households for temporary care. After they grow up, all of them will be sold, and the proceeds will be used entirely for the education fund. It is reported that more than 1,000 chickens have already been raised, and it is estimated that they will be fully grown in the winter, yielding a price of over 8 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Qu Yaokang Fetes Li Huitang, Thiel Doux Flies to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Huitang, the "King of Football," who led the South China Football Team to Shanghai to hold charity football matches, has been in Shanghai for nearly twenty days since his arrival. Besides a two-day trip to Beijing, he has been practicing tennis on Zhaozhujiao Road every day in Shanghai. Last night, Qu Yaokang, a person enthusiastic about sports, hosted a special banquet for Li Huitang at Huibinlou. Among those invited to accompany him were the former famous football coach, the Westerner Li Silian, Chen Hanming, Ke Lasha, and tennis players Li Guofan, Wang Lido, and others, eight or nine people in total. During the banquet, the host and guests talked freely about major events in the sports world. At around 9:00 PM, after taking a group photo, they dispersed.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The famous Italian goalkeeper Thiel Doux has recently decided to go to Hong Kong to join the Oriental Association. If a plane ticket can be arranged today, he may fly to Hong Kong with Feng Jingxiang this afternoon. Therefore, at Qu's banquet last night, he repeatedly asked Li Huitang to take care of Thiel Doux after returning to Hong Kong, because he had never been to South China and was unfamiliar with the people and place. It is natural to need someone familiar to take care of him. As for when Li Huitang himself will leave Shanghai, various parties are very concerned. Last night, the reporter asked if he would stay in Shanghai for a while. According to him, "Besides entrusting someone to buy a plane ticket, I will probably stay in Shanghai for another two or three days. There are some personal matters that have not been completed and need to be dealt with urgently. As soon as they are completed, I will immediately move to return to the south."</p>

<h3>City Government Revises Employee Guarantee Rules</h3>
<p>Effective August 1st</p>
<p>The City Government previously stipulated employee guarantee rules and guarantee rules for personnel managing property. As some parts were not applicable, they have been merged and revised into employee guarantee rules, effective from August 1st. An order was issued yesterday to the departments concerned that, to avoid repetition of changes, the department heads should carefully check the guarantee procedures that have already been prepared for current employees. At the same time, the revised rules should be notified to the original guarantors for review. If there is no objection, it will be considered continuously valid. New employees will be handled in accordance with the revised rules.</p>
<h3>Eighth District People's Representative Assembly Requests Filling in Zhaojiabang</h3>
<p>People's representatives of the Eighth District (Xujiahui) believe that the section of Zhaojiabang within the district, from the Xujiahui Tianzhu Bridge to Tushanwan, has poor drainage of sewage and is detrimental to sanitation. Two options, dredging and filling, have been proposed and submitted to the municipal authorities for approval.</p>
<h3>21st District Promotes Mass Literacy Movement</h3>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Culture Section of the 21st District Office (Jiangwan) convened a forum with various bao chiefs and principals of public and private elementary schools at the district office to discuss ways to promote mass literacy education. The district office instructed the bao offices to widely publicize and urge the jia chiefs to persuade households to enroll. When necessary, the bao and jia offices may use a lottery method to order enrollment.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(26) Question: Residents of villages and towns often report several families as one household to reduce taxes, and one family as several households to avoid conscription. Furthermore, there are places where civil servants and military dependents gather. If the number of bao and jia is increased according to the organization, the selection of bao and jia chiefs will also be a problem. How should this be resolved?</p>
<p>Answer: Refer to Articles 45 and 53 of the Outline of the Organization of Counties at All Levels and the County Baojia Household Registration Compilation Method to strictly compile the baojia household registration to meet the statutory number. Public temples, boat households, and specially compiled temporary households are attached to ordinary households and are not subject to number restrictions. As for the selection of bao and jia chiefs, the principle is to select fair gentry from the local area as much as possible.</p>
<p>(27) Question: Are "going elsewhere" and "moving out" the same thing, or is there a distinction?</p>
<p>Answer: "Going elsewhere" and "moving out" should be two different things. "Going elsewhere" refers to being temporarily absent from the survey location at the time of the survey. "Moving out" refers to leaving the survey location for a long period of time. "Going elsewhere" is still part of the permanent population within the original household registration, while "moving out" is part of the permanent population within the current household. Therefore, although "moving out" is "going elsewhere," "going elsewhere" is not necessarily "moving out." Furthermore, according to Article 3 of the Temporary Household Registration Regulations, "moving out" should be changed to "moving away."</p>
<p>(28) Question: What type of household registration should cooperatives be classified under?</p>
<p>Answer: Cooperative public welfare associations, unlike ordinary shops for profit, should be classified as public households in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 4 of the County Baojia Household Registration Compilation Method, which refers to other public places.</p>
<p>(29) Question: How should the surname of someone who inherits two family lines be registered?</p>
<p>Answer: Article 985 of the Civil Code stipulates that a person with a spouse may not remarry, and Article 237 of the Criminal Code further stipulates that a person who remarries shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years. Therefore, the matter of inheriting two lines, if it occurred before the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code, should not violate Articles 4 and 5 of the Household Registration Law, which state that "no one may have two household registrations or dependent registrations at the same time," and Article 1 of the Regulations on Restrictions on the Use of Names, which states that "the name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one and is registered on the household registration book as the real name." One place may be designated as the household registration or dependent registration, and one real name may be used. Two household registrations or dependent registrations cannot be held at the same time, and two real names cannot be used. The circumstances of combining two family lines should be noted in the remarks column of the application form for investigation. If it occurred after the implementation of the Family Law of the Civil Code, it is legally invalid and will not result in two names or two household registrations or dependent registrations in the household registration.</p>

<h3>American Merchants Prepare to Receive Incoming Raw Material Orders, Resulting in Difficulties for Foreign Firms and Brokers</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The market for dye raw materials for dye factories has been extremely weak recently. The number of tea deals has decreased significantly compared to before. New brands of American sulfide dyes, NK and HK, have arrived. Their quality is slightly lower than 693 and 692, and the price is also lower. Currently, HK sells for around 900,000, and NK sells for around 1,100,000, but there are few inquiries. Indigo has also arrived, but has not yet been sold. Because this type of dye has not yet been launched on the market, manufacturers dare not purchase new brands of dye. Sulfide alkali has arrived in the greatest quantities, and the price has already fallen to around 35,000. Traders are unwilling to lower the price further due to cost considerations, while manufacturers are mostly aware of the large number of orders arriving and are still waiting for prices to drop further. According to experienced raw material traders, many of those who place orders with foreign countries are unplanned. There are many households, and they value secrecy. When the goods arrive at the port, those with limited capital are eager to sell, so the price drops to the bottom. According to their estimates, the current market prices for sulfide alkali and insurance powder are already close to cost. If the price drops further, it will result in losses. No one is willing to do it unless they can withstand the pressure of heavy profits. They also say that some foreign firms are indeed honest in handling orders, but there are also unscrupulous traders who take advantage of the situation. When goods are scarce and prices are high, the goods delivered to designated customers are not the entire amount. Furthermore, when orders are placed, the customers pay a certain percentage of the price to the foreign firm, but the foreign firm has a separate contract with the foreign merchant and does not need to pay the full amount.</p>
<p>Profits from Hedging are Considerable</p>
<p>Therefore, the excess down payment can be invested for profit. When goods arrive from abroad, the procedure involves a letter of credit system. The foreign firm must unload the goods at the dock before preparing funds to collect the warehouse receipt. The designated customer must pay the foreign firm the full amount of the goods upon receiving notification. The firm is informed when the cargo ship is about to arrive at the port. Currently, there is insufficient space at the docks, and customs procedures are cumbersome. It often takes a month from the time the ship arrives at the port to the time it is unloaded. The interest earned during this period is also considerable. Furthermore, the docks are currently unstable, warehouses are scarce, and miscellaneous fees are endless. Large customers may be able to handle it themselves, but small customers and ordinary factories often entrust foreign firms to handle it on their behalf. The complexity of the calculations and the incompleteness of the documents create opportunities for foreign firms to make money. It is said that a certain foreign firm has earned three to four hundred thousand US dollars this year due to these various factors. Under this heavy layer of exploitation, it has become extremely difficult for designated customers to make money. Currently, people in the industry are afraid and hope for change. According to various sources, few new orders are being placed recently. However, those with access to information point out that the goods arriving in the future will be directly sold by American merchants, and the quantity may increase. Upon investigation, the largest American pigment company in the Far East is the恒信 Foreign Firm, while soda ash has historically been sold in bulk by the British卜內門 Foreign Firm. There was news that恒信 would resume operations long ago, but it has not yet materialized. People in the industry have repeatedly spread rumors that a certain Zhou, who was formerly a comprador for the德孚 Foreign Firm, will take the position of comprador for 恒信. When asked to people close to the firm, they said there was no confirmed news. The 南星 Foreign Firm is also a large-scale American pigment firm. People in the industry also spread rumors that its former comprador, Wang, is also seeking opportunities.</p>
<p>Merchants Headache Due to Evasion and Exploitation</p>
<p>According to those close to customs, there has been a lot of smuggling recently. At the docks and warehouses, some people have pointed out that the original goods are missing weight. Therefore, those in charge are quite anxious and have requested the assistance of the municipal chamber of commerce. However, the chamber of commerce has politely declined due to insufficient manpower. Currently, everyone in the market has a headache regarding the warehouse receipts for goods leaving the浦東 warehouses. The reason is due to this. According to those familiar with the situation, there is currently insufficient space at the浦西 docks, and those occupied by government agencies are not helpful for commercial use. Therefore,浦東 warehouses are making triple the profits. When people holding receipts go to pick up goods, if they find that the weight is missing, neither the seller of the receipt nor the warehouse is responsible. Furthermore, the cost of the barges exceeds the cost of shipping across the Pacific Ocean from the United States. Taking the aforementioned sulfide alkali as an example, it is currently sold for 35,000 yuan, while the barge fee alone costs several thousand yuan, not including dock tips.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Trading is Scarce</h3>
<p>Publicly priced transactions are even rarer. Speculative buying is more active. Unconsolidated丙 bonds are not as lively as detached bonds. Unconsolidated丙 bonds continue to struggle between 680 yuan and 700 yuan, lacking momentum for change. As a result, they fell 20 yuan compared to last Saturday. 甲 and 乙 bonds are relatively stable. 丁 bonds rose slightly by 10 yuan, while 戊 bonds fell back by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>謙泰豫 Bank Opens, Receives Over 3 Billion in Deposits</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of 謙泰豫 Bank moved into its new location at 561 Hankou Road last month and opened yesterday. On that day, it received deposits totaling over 3 billion yuan. The bank's head office was established in Chongqing more than 20 years ago. It currently has branches in Chongqing, Jiangjin, Baisha, Luxian, and other places. Branches are currently being planned in Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places.</p>
<h3>Striving for Market, Exchanging Goods, Significance of Textile Exports, Overseas Chinese Have Strong Need for Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a person in charge of the China Textile Construction Company, the company's recent proposal to the government to lift the ban on textile exports is mainly aimed at seizing the opportunity to lay the foundation for the sale of Chinese textiles in the Southeast Asian market. It is said that the significance of this matter can be divided into three aspects: (1) From the international perspective, a large number of American cottons have recently been shipped to Japan one after another. The Japanese textile industry has already started 3.5 million to 4 million spindles. It is currently actively promoting trade to Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom is also actively reorganizing textile mills in India in order to mass produce and expand the Southeast Asian market. Therefore, from the perspective of international market competition, it is imperative to strive for the Southeast Asian market at this time. (2) In general terms, the domestic market's need for textiles must be taken into account. However, the domestic market's need is mostly for coarse yarn. If a portion of fine yarn above 32 counts and fine cloth below 12 pounds can be reasonably distributed to foreign markets, it will not affect domestic market prices and will stimulate production. At the same time, the sale of textiles to Southeast Asia will consider barter exchange methods in order to easily obtain urgently needed food sugar, rubber, rice, coal, gasoline, ramie, wood, and other materials. This will undoubtedly help the entire Chinese economy. (3) In specific terms, leaders of overseas Chinese in Java and Siam recently intend to purchase various fine yarns and colored fabrics from the Textile Construction Authority, totaling 120,000 pounds, and hope to ship them out by mid-month. Therefore, it is hoped that the ban on textile exports can be lifted before the deadline so that exports can be made on schedule. From the perspective of Textile Construction, this can be said to be a win-win situation. (甲) The enemy-owned textile mills taken over by Textile Construction are mostly equipped with machines mainly for spinning fine yarn, so this can be fully utilized. (乙) Textile Construction's future business should focus on developing the foreign market as its primary objective. It is now heard that government authorities believe that lifting the ban on textile exports is deeply and significantly related to China's international trade, and may consider discussing it with the Supreme National Defense Council for the record.</p>
<h3>Allotted Sugar Sold on the Black Market, Authorities are Planning to Improve Measures, Sugar Firms May also be Allotted</h3>
<p>The平價 sugar in this city has been distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Company in the seventh phase. The retail stores throughout the city began selling on the second of this month. The eighth phase is currently being verified, and the ninth phase will be registered this Wednesday. A total of 11,456 packages were distributed in the seventh phase, priced at 740 yuan per catty, and the retail price was set at 860 yuan. However, because the black market price is twice as high as the allotted price, and the price in other cities is even higher, merchants transfer the allotted sugar to the black market in various ways, so citizens still cannot purchase it. It is heard that the allotment method will be changed, and the Taiwan Sugar Company and the Social Affairs Bureau are discussing it. According to Taiwan Sugar Company General Manager Shen Zhennan, the purpose of changing the 平價 sugar allotment to retail merchants this time was to suppress sugar prices and facilitate the citizens of the city. The company agrees to try it from a supply perspective. Now that the phenomenon of being unable to buy it has occurred, the benefits have fallen into the hands of a few people, which is truly contrary to the original intention of the authorities. According to the Sugar Industry Association, it is hoped that the Social Affairs Bureau will improve the measures and still directly allot to sugar merchants. The authorities have taken this into consideration.</p>
<h3>Mountain Villagers Have No Profit to be Made, Source of Bamboo is Scarce</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Xixi塢 in the west of Xiao邑 is famous for its production of bamboo and wood. The general residents mostly rely on the abundance of bamboo and wood in the mountains for their livelihoods. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the bamboo trade plummeted, and the people's economy was extremely depleted. After eight years of war, although all the毛竹 have been accumulated for a long time, the export of毛竹 this year has been even more reduced than before. Because the cost is too high, each head of bamboo is estimated to weigh slightly less than 900 catties, plus cutting, dragging, bunching, and transportation costs, plus a tax of 270 yuan per head, for a total cost of more than 14,000 yuan per head (not including round-trip travel expenses). With insufficient capital, they can only sell it to traders in the nearby Meixi鎭. According to the current market price of bamboo, each head is only sold for 15,000 to 16,000 yuan, with no profit to be made. Furthermore, the traders' payment for goods often requires a term of one or two months. The mountain villagers bear too much interest and are all taking a passive attitude.</p>
<h3>Rice and Oil Gradually Fall, Miscellaneous Grains also Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south rice markets arrived with more than 7,000 stones in total, and digestion was sluggish.

The going out of stock of medium-quality蚕豆 was uninspired, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. The stocking in stores of sesame was not refreshing, and the new goods shaped京debuted, and people's hearts were soft, dropping by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The external elimination of raw kernels was unmoved, and the road to stock was quiet, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans were average. Due to the fact that Qingdao already had goods arriving, the store side expected to stock up, and raw beans and vegetable refined oil all fell in unison, plummeting by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, with few transactions. Bean cakes still trended stationarity.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The first cargo ship of the French Postal Company, 頴廣安, arrived from Saigon on the 31st of last month carrying 25,000 bags of rice, as previously reported. It is now known that the second ship,奥格斯特巴, also arrived on the evening of the day before yesterday (Sunday), also carrying 25,000 bags of rice, and is docked at floating buoys 11 and 12 for unloading. It is said that there are still 5,000 tons of洋米 waiting to be shipped after the two ships return to Saigon, and it is expected to arrive at the end of the month. It is heard that the 米糧 Price Review Committee has scheduled a review meeting with relevant parties this afternoon, and the rice price for this week will be adjusted again.</p>

<h3>Coincidentally, Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Hit, 章 is affected by傅, Chinese Stocks and French Merchants Support Enemies, Foreign Stocks are Desolate</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks had no support. Although they wanted to revive midway, they were still weak at the closing. Major accounts were indifferent and sought supply 蛟 to balance. Rongfeng Yarn Factory owner Zhang was summoned as a suspected traitor, and there was no lack of sympathy for the fall of a rabbit. The mid-way fell from high to盘跌. Yong Yarn's high price was 692 yuan, Meiya was 3,800 yuan, Jingfu was 240 yuan, Xinguang was 238 yuan, and Qindian was 178 yuan. The midday low price for Yong Yarn was 663 yuan, Meiya was 3,550 yuan, Jingfu was 222 yuan, Xinguang was 222 yuan, and Qinxing was 160. At noon, they all presented a spin. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yong Yarn fell by 14 yuan, Meiya fell by 130 yuan, Jingfu fell by 7 yuan, Xinguang fell by 2 yuan, and Qinxing fell by 5 yuan. The medium and small stocks, which were relatively cold, continued to fall slightly. The veteran stocks continued to be oversupplied and fell a little further. Xinguangrong has caught up with Jingfu and is on par with it. The foreign stock market was deserted and lifeless. French merchant J.C. Dupuy had 3,000 shares of Yisha. Because he had supported the enemy, he was wanted by the authorities after the victory. However, he has not yet been captured, and all of the French traitor's stocks have been sold and transferred to the market. Recently, some people holding stocks have registered with the company authorities and discovered that the stocks belong to the French traitor and are in the column of enemy property, which has caused problems. Holders have sought to sell them, but buyers are hesitant. Some believe that until the exact number of stocks is investigated and cleared, the foreign stock market's transactions may be suspended. Yisha opened in the morning at 8,500 yuan, with selling but no buying. When it retreated to the 8,000 yuan mark, only a few hundred shares were traded. The rest had no transaction. The general trend was gone and there was nothing that could be done. It is feared that there will be a period of decline. The closing price was mostly 推求 from the approximate price, and as a result, it fell by half a percent to one percent compared to the previous closing price.</p>

There are also fewer ship goods of yellow sand. If the road is far, each ton costs 36,000 to 7,000 yuan. The various mud sales markets mostly have American goods.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>China Industrial Monthly</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth issues combined have been published. This issue is a special issue on the industrial crisis. There are works by Zhang Naiqi, Wu Yun Chu, and others. The current industrial crisis is a head-on drink, and it is sufficient to serve as a reference for those who care about industrialization issues.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market's Sales Turn Smooth, Cotton Cloth Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, Cantonese gangs often pleaded for 20-count large yarns such as special金鷄, 大发, 双马, and other brands, and had a good digestive tract. The going out of stock of small and medium-sized yarns was also smooth, and the rough and fine yarn lines of each branch rose by 230,000 compared to the previous weekend, and the foot was especially strong, but unfortunately the cloth factory did not purchase it because the sales of woven products were stagnant, but the buying and selling of the same industry was not lonely, and the price increased by 40,000, and the trend was still quite beautiful. At noon, Textile Construction opened yarn as usual, 20 counts had monitored凤供sale, 32 counts of fine yarn, with large packets of early packets of tube yarn, all colors available, brands such as阳鹤, 仙桃, 凤, and three others.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton transactions were 평안, and the market price remained firm. Since there was not much stock in the Shanghai port, people's hearts were still hoping for higher prices. Shenxin's first factory and smaller factories had some inquiries, and the price rose by 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market remained tired and weak, and the external sales market was cheaper than the Shanghai market. The customers had no intention of purchasing, but the漂布 only rose by about 250 yuan slightly, but the sales were not smooth, and most of the rest had no glory or disgrace.</p>

<h3>Northeast Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>— This newspaper's August 1st airmail dispatch. Northeast Special Correspondent Han Qingtao</p>
<p>In August, on the Northeast Great Plains, sorghum grows taller than people, enough to conceal people and livestock. This is when the "green screen" that everyone often hears about rises.</p>
<p>When the Green Screen Rises</p>
<p>The green screen presents a significant threat to the summer life of the people of Northeast China, because the continuous large fields of sorghum are precisely the areas where bandits hide and emerge. Travelers in the countryside inquire of each other whether the road is "clear."</p>
<p>Today, the situation is different. What lies before us is a problem that is even more harmful than the banditry of the past: "war." The green screen is conducive to one side conducting sabotage or providing the best tactical advantage, so everyone seems to have a heavy weight pressing on their hearts.</p>
<p>The situation, the news, is constantly spinning in a circle of worry and joy, or joy and worry, never finding a boundary or a normal place. How can emotions calm down?</p>
<p>Coming "To Learn"</p>
<p>On July 11th and 14th, Lin Biao did not go to Changchun to attend the "Du-Lin Meeting" as invited, which caused great frustration. On the 21st, Li Lisan flew to Changchun on behalf of Lin Biao to visit important political figures. Then on the 25th, he flew to Shenyang, seemingly bringing some hope.</p>
<p>On the 26th, Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Command, received Li Lisan for the first time at the Command Headquarters, accompanied by Cai Zonglian, Director of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Military Mediation Department. The conversation lasted three hours. After the meeting, Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang answered reporters' questions, saying, "Commander Du and Mr. Li drank tea, smoked cigarettes, and talked about everything under the sun." Leaving reporters baffled.</p>
<p>On the 27th, Li Lisan paid his respects to Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters. What they talked about is unknown. What is known is that Li Lisan could not discuss the Northeast issue with Director Xiong as the subject, nor did he put forward a practical plan for the overall peace of the Northeast. Li Lisan repeatedly stated that this trip was "to learn."</p>
<p>In Commander Du's Private Residence</p>
<p>At noon on the 28th, Commander Du received Li Lisan for the second time. In order to know the truth of this matter, the reporter, under the scorching sun, rushed to Chongde Street in the southwest corner of Shenyang City and entered a conspicuous small green-tiled building. The owner of this house was originally a Korean prince, and now it is General Du Yuming, who commands the Northeast National Army. The two or three small reception rooms inside have hosted important figures traveling between Beijing and Shenyang, Northeast gentry, and celebrities from all walks of life, solving countless problems concerning the Northeast.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday. Two jeeps were parked at the entrance. Outside the reception room door was another jeep, flying the American flag, with a beautiful female driver sitting on top, leisurely watching the curling smoke. A patch of rocks and small trees were silent, everything displaying an atmosphere of tranquility.</p>
<p>Inside, in the large reception room on the right, sat three figures arguing over positions and perceptions. One was Commander Du Yuming, another was Dong Chenglie, the government representative of the Military Mediation, and the third was Lin Biao's representative, Li Lisan.</p>
<p>When the clock in the reception room struck ten, the three figures began to talk, discussing two issues. The first was to abide by the January 10th agreement, with the government accepting sovereignty over the Northeast and avoiding conflict. The second was to restore transportation and repair the large railway bridge across the First Songhua River, which had been destroyed by the Communist forces.</p>
<p>Li Lisan said, "At this time, repairing the Songhua River railway bridge is a step towards military strategic offensive preparedness, and there is no other explanation." Commander Du said, "Repairing the bridge is for peace, for the national economy and people's livelihood, and for the opening of the China Changchun Railway. After the bridge is repaired, troops will never be transported across it. At the same time, I can say that if the National Army attacks, they can cross the river from anywhere, without relying solely on the railway bridge."</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, Li Lisan said, "Receiving the Northeast does not necessarily require the government to dispatch batches of receiving personnel. This can avoid conflict." Commander Du said, "It is in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to maintain the authority of the government. As long as the Communist forces do not disturb the National Army, the National Army will never overstep the boundaries."</p>
<p>During the conversation, the voices of both sides rose and fell. Li Lisan constantly emitted the laughter that Chinese people make when discussing matters, and also kept saying, "A joke, a joke, that's really a joke!" The Hunan accent constantly had a "striving for the upper hand," "overwhelming the other party" attitude.</p>
<p>Clang, the clock struck one. The opinions of Du and Li still maintained a distant gap. Although Dong Chenglie sometimes interjected a word or two in the middle, or supplemented some opinions, in the end, nothing of substance was gained. Finally, the conversation was declared over.</p>
<p>The Songhua River "Peace Bridge"</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, Commander Du, in order to fulfill his duty as host, hosted a banquet for Li Lisan on the third floor of the Command Headquarters, and invited Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang, Director Cai Zonglian, the Communist members of the three-person team, and the American representative, Colonel Norman, etc., totaling more than twenty people. It can be said that the atmosphere was "lively and cheerful" and "harmonious and friendly."</p>
<p>After three rounds of wine and five courses of dishes, everyone talked about the bridge repair issue again. Li Lisan said, "I received a telegram from Commander Lin saying that the Songhua River railway bridge has already been mostly repaired by your side. My intention is that during the negotiation period, it is best not to repair it temporarily." Commander Du repeatedly guaranteed that repairing the bridge had no military significance, and solemnly declared, "If the Communist side has sincerity and faith, Chinese peace can definitely be achieved from the Northeast negotiations." Li Lisan again expressed disagreement with Commander Du's opinion. Commander Du then said with a smile, "We can use a public opinion poll!" Which aroused a burst of laughter from those present!</p>
<p>American Colonel Norman spoke, and the English translation was a suggestion to establish a neutral zone on the bridge. Commander Du said, "The bridge is in the hands of the National Army, so there should be no problem with the repair. After the repair, I guarantee that the National Army will never attack. Otherwise, the executive group can send personnel to be stationed on the bridge." Colonel Norman smiled and agreed. Commander Du asked, "Would you be willing to go?" Colonel Norman replied with a smile, "I am willing to go!"</p>
<p>Openness, frankness, and straightforwardness filled the entire scene. Li was also greatly moved and had the words to accept Commander Du's bridge repair method. However, the next day, Li expressed to the Central News Agency reporters that he had not said, "Finally, Li accepted Commander Du's bridge repair method." He said he said this: "Since that is the case, I am willing to do my best to avoid the expansion of the incident, telegraph Commander Lin for a decision, and submit it to the Changchun Executive Branch for resolution." On the eve of Li Lisan's departure from Shenyang—at half past four in the afternoon of the 29th, Provisional Headquarters representative Gong Qiaomin, Changchun Forward Branch Director of the Military Mediation Cai Zonglian, and Li Lisan tentatively discussed the issue of both sides releasing prisoners of war. The Provisional Headquarters advocated the complete release of both sides. Li said that Lin Biao had not authorized him, so he could not make a full negotiation. As a result, it was limited to the exchange of opinions between the two sides.</p>
<p>Regarding the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Communist-controlled areas, it is generally expected to proceed gradually, because this matter had already been agreed upon by Lin Biao through the mediation of the Executive Group before Li Lisan left Harbin. But how to proceed technically? When can it possibly begin? It must be after Li Lisan returns to Harbin and reports what was discussed in Shenyang to Lin Biao before the Communist side can formally provide an answer.</p>
<p>The power supply in Shenyang is far too poor. The issue of transmitting electricity from Xiaofengman to Shenyang was agreed upon by Lin Biao at the same time as the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Communist-controlled areas. Now, after the coordination of Mayor Dong Wenqi and Li Lisan, a solution has been reached technically, that is, the dispatched engineering personnel must all wear armbands with the words "Line Repair Engineering Team" separately printed by the municipal government and the three-person team. In addition, they must also have identity certificates and accompany the liaison personnel sent by the Communist side to carry out the repair of the damaged lines between Meihekou and Nanzamu. They departed from Shenyang on August 1st. Some people say, "This is beneficial to the Communist side, because the Xiaofengman power source is in the hands of the National Army, and only one section of the line passes through the Communist area. They can also obtain electricity through this."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, Li Lisan flew to Changchun, followed by a flight to Harbin to report back. He spent five full days in Shenyang, merely exchanging views on the principles of various issues with military and political authorities. Because the distance in opinions was still far, no concrete results were obtained. Was Li Lisan's trip worthwhile? Was it entirely to "learn"? What did both sides gain? This is for everyone to experience for themselves!</p>
<p>A memorial service was held on the 25th. Provincial Chairman Liu personally attended the ceremony. The emotional Chairman Liu even cried bitterly and was almost unable to [illegible]. All the people present at the sacrifice were also deeply moved, and the entire hall cried. Chairman Liu personally asked Provincial Party Committee Chairman Chen and Provincial Security Deputy Commander Liu Yizhou, Police Chief Qi [illegible], etc., to [illegible] methods for arresting the murderer, and instructed all responsible personnel to strictly investigate and ensure capture, without allowing them to escape, and immediately [illegible] Deputy Commander Liu to take charge of the matter. There were also telegrams from the central government, ordering the arrest of [illegible] the murderer.</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Liu, who is in charge of handling this case, is a very suitable person. During the 30-year sports event, the Luoyang [illegible] kidnapping and assassination case, [illegible] sitting alone in a quiet room, thinking deeply [illegible] often for three to five hours, and he would eventually be able to see through the mechanisms. Therefore, solving the Zhang case is only a matter of time. However, the general public hopes that it can be solved quickly to [illegible] people's hearts and restore the locality!</p>
<p>The press in Kaifeng was particularly shocked, unanimously believing this was a despicable and shameful act. However, we always hope that on the one hand, the case will be solved quickly, and on the other hand, there should be measures to mend the fold after the sheep has been lost. The security deployment is really too lacking in meticulousness!</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Zhang Yanmao's Assassination</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng 27th Dispatch. Liu Ji</p>
<p>The Kunming Li and Wen case has not yet been settled, and the assassination case of Zhang Yanmao, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Department, suddenly occurred in Kaifeng, Such lawlessness is truly shocking the entire country. The authorities should immediately seek effective prevention methods so that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, society will become increasingly shaken and uneasy.</p>
<p>The Zhang case is quite unexpected by the general public, because Zhang is sincere, modest, calm, and taciturn. He has always served in the central government, so he is unlikely to offend anyone. Nor have we heard that he has any grievances with the local people. On the morning of the 23rd, the reporter was chatting with thirty-two friends in the room when suddenly a friend walked in and said, "Secretary-General Zhang has been assassinated!" As soon as the words were uttered, everyone was shocked! Based on what was said above about Zhang's life, this is truly too bizarre!</p>
<p>It is said that on the morning of the 23rd, Zhang, as usual, took his own eight-horsepower rickshaw to the Provincial Party Department to work. While passing through the corner of Yanshou Temple Street, two people riding bicycles, wearing newly made grass-green uniforms and pistols in holsters, suddenly chased after Zhang, repeatedly shouting to stop. The rickshaw puller mistakenly thought they were friends, so he stopped. Zhang also got out of the car, with one foot on the ground and one foot still in the carriage. One of the two people immediately took out a gun and fired a shot at Zhang's head, which missed. The other person then fired several shots in succession, hitting three shots. Zhang died on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two people rode away on their bicycles!</p>
<p>Although Yanshou Temple Street is located in a remote area, it is still within the city. Moreover, a police post is set up at the street corner where the incident occurred. Yet, in broad daylight, the murderers were allowed to escape freely. It is unknown what the police post is responsible for. It is said that the police officer did not know what happened at the time, and only learned about it afterwards. He then quickly returned to his station to report. By the time the news was sent out and people rushed to the scene of the incident, Zhang's family and friends were weeping bitterly over the body. The security officials were also unable to devise any methods for arresting the perpetrators. The provincial leaders also came to visit one after another, but everyone had no good ideas. The main reason is that this matter is too bizarre and it is simply impossible to find any clues!</p>
<p>After the Zhang case occurred, people were panicking, and the gate control of various agencies became more stringent as a result. According to general discussion on the causes of this case, there are two types, (1) political and (2) vendetta. But what exactly is going on? No conclusion has been reached to this day, because everyone infers that Zhang is unlikely to have any enemies. As for political reasons, that is hard to say. However, from the situation of the murderer, we can know that there was a detailed plan and preparation beforehand, and there are planners and instigators behind the scenes. This can be determined.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Musings</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zizheng</p>
<p>The term typhoon originally came from the Cantonese word for strong wind. This type of strong wind is a tropical anti-clockwise cyclone. Its formation is due to the collision of the northeast trade winds and the southwest monsoon, which creates a vortex of airflow. Therefore, typhoons often form at the interface between equatorial air masses and subtropical air masses. In the typhoon formation zone, solar radiation is strong, convection is very strong, and both temperature and humidity are high. The tropical storm formed by this air mass allows the typhoon center to store a high degree of potential energy. Based on the experience of the past thirty-four years, the typhoon formation area generally occurs west of Guam and north of Yap Island, but with slight seasonal variations. In early summer, the latitude of its occurrence is slightly more southern. In midsummer, the latitude of its occurrence turns more northern. The movement of typhoons is first eastward and then westward, and after reaching the turning point, it changes to the northeast. Although its path has no rules, it generally forms a parabolic line. Typhoons that strike the Chinese coast mostly occur in July. In the past thirty years, there have been sixty-five times. In August there are only forty-eight times. September has twenty times, and June only ten times. Before June and after September, the typhoon's strength [illegible] and the Chinese coast [illegible]. The paths typhoons [illegible] often take to strike China can be roughly divided into two. 1. From the east of the Philippine Islands, advance northwestward across northern Luzon Island to the South China Sea, turning to strike southern China. In early summer and autumn, its path often follows this route. 2. From the northeast of Luzon Island, move northwestward or north-northwestward through the southern Ryukyu Islands, crossing Taiwan or skimming over Taipei and attacking the southeastern coast of China. Checking the number of typhoons landing on the Chinese coast, 70 percent landed between Zhenhai and Hong Kong. More specifically, typhoons landing south of 25 degrees north latitude account for 68 percent, and those landing north of 25 degrees north latitude account for only 32 percent. After a typhoon lands, the wind force is greatly reduced, but there are also cases where it [illegible] continues to support its power and enters the Yellow Sea to reach Korea, or crosses the Yangtze River and peeks into North China, but the number is quite small. The extent of a typhoon's northward power, in terms of its number, is that more than 60 percent do not exceed 40 degrees north latitude. The average speed of a typhoon's movement is fifteen miles per hour, but its maximum speed can reach forty miles per hour. In the East China Sea, the typhoon's movement is relatively slow, at thirteen or fourteen miles per hour. In the Yellow Sea, the movement is faster, at about eighteen or nineteen miles. When the typhoon's direction of movement is about to change, its movement is particularly slow. After turning, the speed of movement often increases by half as much as before turning. From formation to disappearance, typhoons seen in the Far East in recent years can last up to twenty-six days, but most average only six or seven days. The typhoon's wind force only feels tight and rainy when approaching the center of the wind by one hundred miles. When a typhoon comes, there are strong winds and heavy rains. [Illegible] One year, on July 11, a typhoon passed over northern Luzon, and rainfall reached 46 inches in 24 hours, breaking the world record for torrential rain. On July 19, 1926, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, with rainfall reaching 21 inches in one day. There were as many as nine rain disasters caused by typhoons in the southeastern coast area from the beginning of the Republic to 1932. Among the disasters caused by this type of typhoon, the wind disaster in Shantou on August 2, 1922, was the most tragic. This time, the death toll reached more than 60,000 people. Losses are estimated to have exceeded 70 million yuan in that year. According to past records, only sixteen typhoons have landed between Shanghai and Zhenhai successively. The threat of typhoons received near Shanghai is much less than in Wenzhou and points south. Currently, in addition to weather reports provided on time by ships stationed in the ocean and island meteorological stations, whenever a new typhoon is discovered, meteorological reconnaissance aircraft are dispatched at any time to determine its location. Currently, only Guam and Manila have this type of flight reconnaissance atmospheric equipment. If China develops its shipping and establishes its navy, this type of equipment to assist in weather reconnaissance is essential. Although there are no accurate statistics on the annual typhoon losses suffered by people along the Chinese coast, it is estimated to be considerable. As for the hardships felt by boatmen and fishermen in general, whose livelihoods are dependent on the sea, they are even more profound. Shanghai is an international commercial port, and ships coming and going from various countries need meteorological reports. The [illegible] government authorities should pay attention to and assist in promoting the progress of meteorological construction. This will not only be convenient for commercial navigation. Fishermen and boatmen will also benefit greatly.</p>

<h3>Switzerland: An International Summer Capital</h3>
<p>Lushan has become China's summer capital today, with its secluded forests, flowing springs around the houses. Living in the mountains, one truly does not know that there is still a hot summer in the world. But the world's summer capital is Switzerland. Not only does it have a mild climate and four seasons like spring, but some mountain tops are covered with snow all year round. Even in the noon of July and August when the sun is overhead, it will still make people feel slightly cold. Before the war, every summer, thousands upon thousands of travelers came to this small country by air and land to escape the heat. This has always been a considerable income for the Swiss government. During the war years, everyone was fighting hand-to-hand on the line of life and death, and Switzerland was naturally much deserted. Now, with the victory of the war, the scenic mountains and waters of Switzerland will restore their former glory.</p>
<p>Switzerland is mostly mountainous, with the Alps running across the entire country, accounting for almost three-fifths of its entire territory. The first time you arrive in Switzerland [illegible] a place is like a rockery scene, [illegible] ups and downs, creating a spectacular sight. Some peaks soar into the clouds, looking down on the lower world; others undulate continuously, like waves on the sea, chasing each other; among these high and low peaks, there are [illegible] countless towns and villages of all sizes.</p>
<p>The scenery of Switzerland is also like the situation in the southern and northern sections of the Alps, full of many distinct landscapes. Even one village is different from another, and one town is different from another. Some places seem to be entirely Arctic landscapes, barren and without vegetation, but after walking for only a few hours, you will discover another world, a southern-style plateau with olive trees, pine trees, and corn growing in a lush, pleasing green. One place is cold [illegible], while another is warm like spring. Switzerland is truly an enchanting place! Its air seems to always have a clear freshness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is also the case in terms of architecture. In Switzerland, you can see quaint old-fashioned wooden houses, wooden sun decks, and brightly colored walls everywhere, but at the same time, you can also see towering French-style marble buildings standing side by side on the road.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we must of course especially mention the federal capital of Switzerland, Geneva, and its world-famous Lake Geneva, which almost every tourist visits. Lake Geneva is surrounded by mountains on all sides, with beautiful scenery, which goes without saying. By the lake (actually, it should be said in the lake), there is also a very historic prison called "Chillon Castle." It is built in the lake, surrounded by water on all sides. Some [illegible] rooms [illegible] are even built underwater, forming a crystal palace of bronze walls and iron walls. The shimmering [illegible] water beats [illegible] outside, and all day long there is only a thin line of light, which penetrates in from the small window of the iron railing. Outside is a world of beautiful mountains and clear waters, while inside is a tragic and bleak life that is forever isolated from all of this. How can this scene not make people sad! A patriot who worked hard for Switzerland's independence was once arrested and imprisoned in this "Chillon Castle" for twenty-five years. Byron, a famous poet of the 19th century in England, traveled here and wrote a short poem that was famous throughout Europe, praising this castle. Since then, this prison, which stands in the lake and has long been eroded by wind and rain, has become a symbol of freedom and independence for oppressed people around the world. (Jun Mo)</p>

<h3>Two Inappropriate Aspects of the Study Abroad Examination</h3>
<p>Editor: I am one of the participants in the Ministry of Education's publicly funded study abroad examination this time. I deeply admire the meticulous planning and serious, strict invigilation of the Shanghai Education Bureau beforehand, as well as the orderly examination process without any irregularities, as your newspaper described as "a phenomenon unique to those handling examinations in various places." However, the Ministry of Education seems to lack deliberation in the formulation of regulations and test questions, thus losing the principle of fairness. Therefore, I raise two points for your newspaper to consider for discussion among all parties: (1) The countries to which students are being sent this time are divided into eleven countries, including England, America, Canada, Australia, France, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, and Sweden. Among them, apart from England, America, Canada, and Australia, the other countries have their own common languages and writing systems. However, the Ministry of Education stipulates this time that anyone who is not proficient in the language of the country they are applying to can use English instead. If the students are not familiar with the language of the country they are going to, how can they listen to lectures, read, and even pursue further studies after going abroad? (2) The test questions for specialized subjects this time are all in English, which leads to the phenomenon that some people who are not proficient in English, and have no intention of going to England or America, cannot understand the meaning of the questions. Moreover, each country has its own unique characteristics, and there are unique perspectives in these areas. Even specialized terms and the symbols used are not entirely the same. Students usually browse books in the language they are familiar with, but now they are all changed to English, how can they express their true talents and learning, and obtain fair competition? I only hope that the authorities will improve this. (Examinee)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Organize a Universal Education Guidance Class</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>No one would deny that psychological construction is an effective remedy for saving morality from decline. The implementation of this construction relies on "universal education." The educational undertakings in this city have always been known as developed, but compared with the population and the number of schools, they are still not proportional. Therefore, I suggest to those enthusiastic about education: establish a "Universal Education Guidance Class." As for the method, it is proposed to use educational talents among public and education personnel. Those who are willing to be tutors for the "Universal Education Class" (or semi-voluntary tutors); any industrial and commercial organizations that can automatically recruit apprentices and workers, with more than 20 people, can apply to the nearest "Universal Education Class" in accordance with the regulations. After passing the review, a tutor will be assigned to teach (the applicant will pay a small amount of travel expenses each month, or it will be completely voluntary). The class time is more suitable after work. In the past, when I was the principal of the Yongping Yixiao Day and Night School in Caojiadu, I once established a "Universal Education Class." At that time, a small number of factories and merchants came to apply, and public officials were also recruited to serve as tutors. The trial run was somewhat successful. This time, if initiated by advanced figures in the education field, and with the sponsorship of the education authorities, assigning personnel for guidance, organizing in districts, so that young people who dropped out of school midway can have the opportunity to study after work, it will surely have a significant effect for the country and society.

<h3>Repetition of Lane and Alley Names</h3>
<p>Reporter: I live on Gongping Road in Tilanqiao. There are two Gongping Li and one Gongping Fang on this road. One Gongping Li and Gongping Fang are adjacent to each other, and the other Gongping Li is separated by two roads, which is not too far away. There are also two number 35 addresses in Gongping Fang, without any A or B distinctions. The postmen delivering letters and the guests visiting friends are confused every day. Who should be asked to correct this? I think the police station and the district office should quickly correct this when compiling household registration and Baojia. (Zhanyuan)</p>
<h3>Business Expenses Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Editor: In the "Reader Opinions" column on July 31, "What is a Business Expense?" it was stated that the Xiang Bao chief of Xinzhong Township, Xueyanqiao, Wujin, had already determined to levy a field donation this summer. Now, according to insiders, there is no such thing as a field donation. Under orders, military grain was purchased, but it has now been exempted from collection by the central government, and the military wheat that had been collected has been returned separately. As for the business expenses, they include three types of expenses: district office administrative expenses, township office operating expenses, and education subsidy expenses. It was resolved by the Wujin Eighth District Office District Affairs Meeting on June 15 to levy them at the same time as the military grain. Among them, the district expenses and education expenses require a levy of eight market catties of wheat per mu (about four and a half liters) to be able to supplement them. Now, it is proposed to levy five liters of wheat per mu, so the operating expenses of the township office are less than half a liter, and the income is very little. Even with frugality, there are still concerns about insufficient expenditure, so how can we talk about extravagant spending? At present, whether this business expense can be collected is still a problem. I am afraid that fellow villagers abroad do not understand the truth, so I hope to disclose it to dispel public doubts.

<h3>Sheltering Drug-Addicted Beggars on the Streets</h3>
<p>It has been almost a year since the victory. Although the government has strictly prohibited drugs, there are still many drug-addicted beggars entrenched in some alleys and lanes of this city, haggard and tattered. This city is an international metropolis, which hinders the appearance of the city and causes criticism. However, it is believed that most of these beggars lack education, are willing to degenerate, and are addicted to this bad habit. It is hoped that the municipal government authorities will thoroughly eradicate drug traffickers and intensify strict handling on one hand, and shelter drug-addicted beggars on the streets and provide them with rehabilitation on the other hand. Then, teach them skills so that they can have a way to make a living. (Jinlong, Beihai Road)</p>
<h3>How is Business Tax Calculated?</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: Our small laundry shop had a total business income of 438,300 yuan in the spring. Calculated according to 15 per thousand, only 6,574.5 yuan of tax was paid. However, on July 30, we received a payment notice from the Direct Tax Bureau, requiring a tax payment of 75,000 yuan, which is very different from the previous number. How is it calculated? The bureau should provide detailed answers to taxpayers. (Da Yu Laundry Shop, Xiamen Road)</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>We know the harm of cigarettes. Although it is not as obvious as alcohol, because cigarettes contain nicotine, it is easy to get poisoned after smoking too much. After the victory, we feel that cigarettes are more rampant than before the war, but the "No Smoking" signs in tram cars have been painted over with white paint, and it is even harder to see anyone opposing smoking. So foreign cigarettes are in everyone's hands! We hope that the authorities will ban smoking in public places and on vehicles, just like in the New Life Movement era. (Yao Guoji, Xu Yuyan)</p>
<h3>Special Law on Leases</h3>
<p>Editor: In the past, tenants were protected by special laws. For the sake of low rents, they rented one house in the east and another in the west, which was actually more than they needed. But for the sake of low rent, they would not give up the lease, and they could also transfer it, getting a huge amount of money. I don't know why, but the Jiangsu Provincial Government is still sticking to the old ways, issuing a special law on leases, restricting low rents and landlords from refusing to lease and forcing repairs to rented houses. It should be known that restricting low rents will make landlords unwilling to lease because they cannot get considerable interest. The more the property rights of landlords are not protected, the more landlords dare not lease, how can the housing shortage be solved? Since it is not wartime, there is no reason to deprive and restrict, which also violates the law. I wonder what you think, gentlemen? (Xu Ganhan)</p>

<h3>Tanggu New Port After the Takeover</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin, Tianjin Shipping News, 29th of This Month</p>
<p>After the victory, we took over Tanggu New Port from the enemy. Intelligent people all believe that it is far more worthy of attention than some enemy and puppet factories, or some warehouses of enemy materials, because this is a construction that thoroughly cures Tianjin's throat disease and is related to the trade and transportation of the entire North China. Since last November, we have taken over this port, which has already been operated on to eradicate Tianjin's throat disease but whose surgery has not yet been completed. The initial management organization was the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office under the Tianjin-Beiping District Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. In April, the Engineering Office was abolished, and the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office directly under the Ministry of Communications was established. The work is being promoted little by little there, but at present they can only do some sorting work. The plan to complete the entire construction is still under study.</p>
<p>(1) A Glimpse of the Past</p>
<p>The reason why Tianjin's throat disease was formed is that Dagukou is blocked by a famous Dagukou Bar, commonly known as Daguba. Five large rivers in Hebei Province converge in Tianjin and flow to Tanggu through the Hai River. There, the flat terrain reduces the flow of the river, and the sediment is deposited, thus forming the bar. This sand blocks the throat, so that ships with a draft of only ten feet or so cannot enter, and the annual throughput of Tianjin City has not exceeded 1.5 million tons for many years. Leaving aside the Japanese's purpose, they established the Tanggu New Port Temporary Office in June of the 28th year of the Republic of China to investigate the port situation. In October of the 29th year, they prescribed the right medicine and started large-scale construction of the New Port on the north bank of the Hai River estuary. The Japanese's initial plan was to make this new port have an annual throughput of 27 million tons, but they finally reduced the plan to 8 million tons.</p>
<p>Before talking about the situation after our takeover, it is worth looking at the Japanese's plan. The New Port is located on the north bank of the Hai River estuary, fifteen miles east of Tanggu. The main project in their plan is the construction of the north and south breakwaters. The south breakwater is 17 kilometers long and parallel to the Hai River. Its main function is to prevent wind and also to prevent the sediment carried by the Hai River from flowing into the port. The function of the north breakwater is to prevent the wind and waves from the northeast and northwest. Between the two breakwaters, a 200-meter-wide channel is dug and maintained at a depth of six meters, connecting it to the Hai River. At the same time, a ship lock 180 meters long and 21 meters wide is built. After this plan is completed, ships with a draft of less than 16 feet can also reach Tianjin directly through the channel with the regulation of the ship lock during low tide, without having to pass through the Dagukou Bar. Regarding the construction of the wharf, the original plan was to fill the base eastward from the east of the ship lock, north of the channel, and then build four wharves and a pier wharf. Ships with a draft of 16 feet to 20 feet can dock at any time during low tide.</p>
<p>(2) Current Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese started construction in October of the 29th year and completed 50% of the north and south breakwater projects, 90% of the first wharf, 60% of the second wharf, 80% of the ship lock project, two coal loaders, and the channel has been widened to 130 feet and the depth is about 5 meters by the time we won the victory. The subsequent processing and regular dredging depends on how we do it. Many experts who observed the New Port believe that those half-completed works should be completed as soon as possible to have utilization value, otherwise the previous efforts will be in vain. In response to this reality, the New Port Engineering Office plans to complete the ancillary works of the ship lock first. In addition to the ship lock itself, this includes four tasks: (1) Dredging the depth of that channel to six meters, (2) Expanding the ship's water supply facilities, (3) Expanding the electrical lighting equipment, (4) Adding navigation markers. The person in charge said: As long as there is money, it can be rushed to completion within four months.</p>
<p>The current work of the New Port Engineering Office, in addition to sorting out those messy materials scattered everywhere, is handling two major events: salvaging ships and restoring the mechanical factory. To date, four tugboats have been salvaged. Regarding repairs, one pump-type dredger, three tugboats, and one water supply ship have been repaired. Under repair are two pump-type dredgers, one grab-type dredger, and three tugboats. The mechanical factory was restored in May. All ship repair work is directed by the mechanical factory, and most of the parts needed for the ship lock have also been manufactured by the factory. The person in charge of the New Port Engineering Office has agreed with the chief engineer from Nanjing and has stirred up a group of engineering experts from various places. Building a port is an examination and an opportunity for expression. It is time to see our construction.</p>
<p>(3) New Port Plan</p>
<p>What kind of new port do we want? Colonel Dodd, the American advisor to the National Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, drafted an improvement plan. The main parts of this plan are five points: (1) Complete and strengthen the breakwaters, using large pieces of stone weighing five to ten tons in the deep water parts. (2) Complete and deepen the channel so that ships with a draft of less than 20 feet can enter the port. (3) Complete the construction of the ship lock. (4) Complete the construction of the first and second wharves. (5) Complete the loading and unloading equipment, and necessary railway, highway, lighting, water supply, and other equipment. The entire project is based on an annual throughput of 2 million tons. The budget for the project is 50 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Three Opinions</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Zhuobin, Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, proposed an engineering plan for an annual throughput of 1.5 million tons after inspecting the port. He advocated first digging the channel to a depth of six meters and a width of 130 feet, which is enough, and there is no need to widen it to 200 feet, but he believed that a mooring area 700 meters long and 300 meters wide should be dug opposite the first wharf, south of the channel and in the middle of the south breakwater, and set up nine sets of large and small buoys so that it can moor seven ships of about 3,000 tons and two ships of about 10,000 tons, using barges to assist in loading and unloading. In addition, it is necessary to complete the ship lock and the necessary equipment on the shore, and it is not planned to process the breakwater. The engineering cost of this plan is 19 billion yuan. The New Port Engineering Office also has its own plan, hoping to have an annual throughput of 8 million tons. In addition to completing those half-completed projects taken over, it is also preparing to complete the third, fourth and pier wharves. Based on the prices in May, it requires an engineering cost of 99 billion yuan and takes three and a half years. The above three plans are being jointly considered.</p>
<p>People who come back from the New Port are touched by the encounter of this construction when they see those buildings waiting to be rescued and those materials scattered everywhere. It has been almost a year since the victory, and it will be eight or nine months since it was taken over, and it is suffering from hunger like a refugee. The unstable sea is taking advantage of the unstable situation, eroding those dilapidated long dykes day and night. Who can let the sea calm down?</p>
<h3>Our Fleet in Havana</h3>
<p>— Havana, Pearl Harbor Shipping News, July 9, Qiuping</p>
<p>The main reason is that it is too far away from the motherland. The environment does not require a overseas Chinese child to study the language and writing of the motherland, and teachers are also a problem. In Havana, overseas Chinese who are slightly familiar with the writing of the motherland are rare, and even fewer can speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>Then he invited us to his home. This is an affluent and respected family of overseas Chinese. A portrait of President Chiang Kai-shek hangs in the living room, and on the other side are pictures of Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang. Two pots of fresh flowers are placed on the corridor. This is like a clean and elegant family commonly seen in China.</p>
<p>His mother is a middle-aged woman who likes to wear cheongsams and speaks elegantly. She greeted us thoughtfully. She hopes that her beloved son will soon be able to return to the motherland, receive higher education in the motherland, and be able to serve the motherland.</p>
<p>"Our generation has not contributed enough to the motherland. The next generation should dedicate themselves to the motherland," she said with a smile and humility in Cantonese, expressing her inner wish.</p>
<p>This is the sincere love of the entire overseas Chinese for the motherland, and time has not made them (or her) forget the motherland. They are children of China, and their hearts still belong to China. He did not forget us! How can we forget them?</p>
<p>In the evening, the teacher accompanied us to the Hualai Restaurant for a hearty and delicious authentic Chinese meal. Since going abroad, watching Chinese operas and going to Chinese restaurants has become the only hobby, perhaps because exiles miss their homes. After the meal, we argued with him about paying, but his sincerity and hospitality finally won us over. However, the restaurant owner also refused to accept his payment, saying that it was the duty and right of every overseas Chinese to entertain the navy of the motherland. After such an unexpected treat, we dared not go to overseas Chinese restaurants again. Even if we wanted to buy some sundries, we would first look carefully to see if there were any words "Welcome Chinese Navy" at the door.</p>
<h3>Cuban President Inspects Marching Troops</h3>
<p>The program for the twelfth was the Cuban President's inspection of the marching troops and participation in the unveiling ceremony of the Overseas Chinese Monument.</p>
<p>The marching soldiers were transported by ten brand-new transport vehicles to gather in the Chinese district. The front of the team was the Cuban Navy Band, the rear was the Chinese Band, and the middle was the flag guard, led by a motorcycle police team. From the Chinese district in a crowded alley, they passed through the city center and marched all the way to the Presidential Palace. Following closely behind the Chinese band were the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Overseas Chinese Delegation, elementary school students, and overseas Chinese women. The orderly and long marching team was unprecedented in Havana in recent years. Everywhere the team went, traffic was blocked, the music was majestic, the steps were sonorous, raising their heads, sticking out their chests, looking straight ahead, teams connected one after another, as if connected by a thread, applause and praise chased the team, resounding throughout the beautiful Havana.</p>
<p>As the team approached the Presidential Palace, the crowd watching on both streets became more crowded. The motorcycle security team, with wheels and black leather boots shining in the sun, honked their horns and patrolled back and forth along the sidewalk. People crowded down on the sidewalk and were squeezed back again.</p>
<p>When the team passed the Presidential Palace, the officer leading the team gave the command to "Look to the right."</p>
<p>Cuban President Grau and the First Lady of Cuba on the balcony nodded in response, accompanied by Minister Li and Commander Lin of the Chinese Fleet. On the square in front of the mansion, the ancient Navy Band played one majestic and exciting military music after another.</p>
<p>When the flag guard passed by, the band changed to the Chinese national anthem. The President and the accompanying officers stood at attention and saluted the national flag, and the surrounding crowd quickly took off their hats and stood in silence, paying their respects, holding their breath, only hearing the sound of the waves hitting the Atlantic coast and the military music, lingering in people's hearts, making people feel majestic and solemn.</p>
<p>The crowd followed the team, bypassing the seaside road to the Overseas Chinese Monument. It was already noon, and sweat dripped from the edge of their inner shirts, but our heads were always held high. We are a young team, we are trained.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of our youth, our will is not inferior to others.</p>
<p>First, Minister Li and the Cuban president delivered speeches one after another, praising the special merits of the overseas Chinese in the Cuban independence movement, the development of Sino-Cuban friendly relations, and the significance of the Chinese Navy's visit.</p>
<p>In the long Spanish speech, I heard many words such as "China and Cuba," "war," and "victory." The content of the speech was told to me afterwards by an overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the escort destroyers Taikang and Taiping were open to the public. People from China and the West came and went in an endless stream at the San Francisco Wharf. The queue waiting to visit stretched from the berth to the gate, and there was also a crowd squeezing in the center of the street trying to get in to visit.</p>
<p>My Cantonese classmate Deng and I accompanied a group of young overseas Chinese and three Cuban female students to visit the wharf, but we couldn't get in. Fortunately, in a moment, a small launch from the ship came to wait for the transportation of food, so we boarded the launch and circled the port to board the flagship. Overseas Chinese representatives maintained order at the dock, and sentries on the ship indicated the tour route. The tour area was limited to the deck and bridge.</p>
<p>Deng explained the nouns and functions of each part to the overseas Chinese in Cantonese. I accompanied the three Cuban students to visit each gun position. Because I was a gunner, I explained the range, operation, and effectiveness of each gun in detail in English, from three-inch guns, four-centimeter machine guns, two-centimeter anti-aircraft machine guns to the depth charges at the stern.</p>
<p>When we came down from the ship, the crowd outside the gate had not decreased. We walked along the embankment and took a few photos with the ships anchored in the port as the background. They told us about the situation at the University of Cuba, and we described some of our life at sea. Along with the sound of the waves, we sang until the evening, when the white sails brought in the sunset, and the setting sun teased the sea to blush.</p>
<p>Classical Dance in America</p>
<p>Female students at Cornell University in the United States learn dance outside of class, and their activities are almost indistinguishable from dance clubs. This dance is called "A Woman's Walk," which depicts the posture of the wife of an American fisherman in ancient times (the colonial era) waiting for her husband to return from overseas.

<h3>Chinese Chamber of Commerce Holds a Ball</h3>
<p>At ten o'clock in the evening, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a ball to entertain the fleet officers. The Kuomintang and Zhi Gong Party branches also separately held cocktail dance parties to entertain the soldiers.</p>
<p>With diligent hospitality and affectionate smiles, tonight's attendees were even more crowded than last night. Embroidered Spanish-style long skirts brushed against white trousers as couples leaned close and silently waltzed.</p>
<p>The sound of yesterday's turbulent waves was drowned out by laughter. Tomorrow seemed so far away. How many people found interpretations of love in tender gazes? Words and writings were so powerless!</p>
<p>At the ball, through the introduction of the editor of the Zhi Gong Party's Jianming Public Report, I met a Cuban lady of nobility. Her elegant demeanor and fluent conversation made her seem like a sociable noblewoman at a Parisian banquet. She was the secretary of the Cuban Women's Federation and expressed with grace that it was an unparalleled honor to attend the welcome dance party for the Chinese Navy. She also said that she studied space abroad in university, and then explained that this seemed to be a common situation of insufficient progress worldwide, which was precisely the reason she took on the role of secretary of the Women's Federation.</p>
<p>Inside, light and lively Spanish music swelled. Outside, pairs of figures sat together, smiling, nodding, their eyes in conversation. In the quiet, beautiful night of the port city, unspoken feelings rippled across the night sky.</p>
<p>A burst of enthusiastic applause greeted the arrival of Minister Li and Commander Lin, escorted by Zhu Jia Zhao, the chairman of the Zhi Gong Hall. The music did not stop, throwing laughter and attention towards them. Staff Officer Xu began to sing "When Will You Return?" Its gentle lyrics, like autumn rain, sprinkled on the hearts of the young.</p>
<p>After the song ended, the young people began to busy themselves, exchanging gifts and keeping contact information. Tomorrow, the waves will carry us further away, but the memory will always be vivid.</p>
<p>"Farewell, Havana, the beautiful resort of Central America, farewell, beautiful ladies (Seuovta Bonita), sons and daughters of China!"</p>
<p>The sound of engines cut through the lingering farewells, and waving handkerchiefs disappeared into the dawn. Gazing at the white buildings rising and falling in the waves, someone on the deck softly sang "Accidentally": "I am a cloud in the sky, occasionally projected onto your rippling heart. You don't need to be surprised, nor do you need to be happy, in this instant, I disappear without a trace. You and I meet on the dark sea, you have your direction, I have mine. Whether you remember or you forget, it is best to forget, in this encounter, the light we mutually release."</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of the Yongli Ammonia Factory: A Flower of Chinese Industry</h3>
<p>— A special report from our Nanjing correspondent, Ding Weidong</p>
<p>(I) Escaping the Difficulties</p>
<p>The fact that the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory in Pukou has been able to survive to this day and work for the reconstruction of our country was unimaginable before the end of the War of Resistance. This factory has escaped destruction three times. The first time was during the Battle of Shanghai, with enemy planes bombing it a total of four times. However, due to the enemy's poor technology, the main parts of the factory were not damaged. The second time was when the factory staff evacuated on December 20th, 1937. Due to the urgency, they only took away some valuable parts and did not carry out large-scale destruction. The third possible destruction was on the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance; to be precise, after the establishment of the Hwa-Shih Super Fortress base in April 1944. According to a friend of the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory, at that time, the American Embassy officially sent someone to meet Mr. Fan Xudong, requesting various photos of the factory for reference in implementing strategic bombing. Mr. Fan generously sent all the photos and painfully expressed to people that he would rebuild an ammonia factory after the war instead of restoring the old factory because he could not bear to see the tragic state of rubble. Later, the U.S. Air Force had been over the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory, and they must have recognized the target, but they only fired a row of machine guns at the gas plant without dropping any bombs. Thus, the Yongli factory escaped destruction again. In less than a few months, the enemy surrendered unconditionally. Due to the regulations for accepting the surrender, they were responsible for safekeeping and did not dare to destroy it at will. The Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory was finally returned intact. A few days ago, two foreign experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) came to visit the ammonia factory. Afterwards, they told people that they had inspected industries all over China, including Taiwan. The speed of resuming work after the takeover and the enthusiasm of the staff were unmatched by any other factory except Yongli. At the same time, the factory's scale and modern equipment also made the ammonia factory second to none. Today, the author is on the scene and has witnessed the factory's grand scale and the staff's high enthusiasm. He also deeply feels that this factory is truly the elite of Chinese industry. Its existence is truly due to the blessing of fate, otherwise, with the current financial difficulties of the national treasury, wanting to assist industrialists in running such a large-scale factory, one does not know when it could be successfully done!</p>
<p>(II) Purpose of Establishing the Factory</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory was national defense first, and the people's livelihood second. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), the Central District had established a national policy of self-reliance as the basis for self-strengthening and repentance. The ammonia factory was also a product of this national policy, although in nature it was a private industrial enterprise. In 1933, the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) summoned Mr. Fan Xudong to discuss the grand plan of building the factory. This outstanding industrialist expressed at the time that he was willing to do his best for the country, but the capital required for the ammonia factory was enormous. In terms of fundraising, government assistance was needed. Secondly, he strongly disagreed with joint government-business operation and advocated government supervision and private management. These two requests were immediately adopted at the time. The decision to locate it in Pukou was also the intention of the authorities. The reason was nothing more than proximity to the capital for easy supervision, and also to facilitate visits from foreign guests, so that they would have an unforgettable impression of the determination of the new China to build. In 1934, the factory construction officially began. At that time, the Yongli Company issued corporate bonds worth 15 million yuan, with the government guaranteeing the principal and interest, and underwritten by major banks. In terms of technical design, it was presided over by American engineers. A friend of Yongli told me that this was a very specialized job. At that time, there were only three countries that built ammonium sulfate factories—China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. China's factory was in Pukou, Japan's factory was in Dalian (twice the size of ours), and the Soviet Union's factory was in Europe. And those responsible for the design were all these American technicians. In the following two years, the Yongli staff worked with the greatest enthusiasm. Due to their efforts, China's factory was the first to succeed. In February 1937, the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory officially started operation.</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), the products of the Yongli Ammonia Factory were ammonia, not sulfuric acid or nitric acid, because they did not want to compete with the small and medium-sized factories in the country. At that time, they were worried about the sales of ammonia because the goods of the British company Brunner Mond &amp; Co. had always controlled the market. But facts proved that these were unnecessary worries. At that time, Yongli signed contracts with Guangdong and Fujian provinces, undertaking the sales of all the factory's products. Jiangsu, where the factory was located, could not buy Yongli's fertilizer. After a considerable period of time, it was proven that the quality of Yongli's goods was better than imported goods. First, imported goods traveled across the ocean, and were easily affected by moisture. Second, the nitrogen content of Yongli's goods was 0.8% higher than imported goods. Therefore, the reputation of the ammonia factory was established, and even with a daily output of 150 tons, it was still in short supply. When the War of Resistance broke out, the ammonia factory immediately became a national defense industry, producing more than 100 tons of sulfuric acid and nitric acid daily, supplying military needs. At that time, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a commissioner to be stationed in the factory for liaison purposes. What was regrettable was that Yongli's service to the War of Resistance was very short. On November 20th, 1937, as the military situation deteriorated, the factory staff were ordered to evacuate completely. I once asked a friend of Yongli: Why didn't they thoroughly destroy the factory or move away the main parts so that they could build a factory in the rear? Their explanation was: In terms of thorough destruction, the evacuation was too hasty. At that time, in order to supply military needs, production continued until the last day. At the same time, the factory's scale was very large, and thorough destruction required sufficient time and technical preparation, which was not allowed by the situation at the time. As for moving the machines, it was even out of the question at that time. Because the ammonia factory's machines were too large and too heavy, for example, one synthesizer of the compressor part was cast from a mixed steel and weighed 108 tons. When this machine was shipped from the United States, the largest crane on the Shanghai wharf could only lift 50 tons of goods. It was Yongli Company who made a 100-ton crane themselves that solved the problem. In times of war emergency, transportation was impossible. And at that time, the conditions of Yangtze River transportation made moving the factory impossible. Regarding the first reason, I am ashamed to say that I have no engineering expertise and dare not express an opinion. Regarding the second reason, after seeing the scale of the ammonia factory and thinking about the situation of the factories moving to Sichuan in the rear, I believe that it was indeed unavoidable. It was certainly an unpleasant thing for the factory to be used by the enemy. However, after the victory, the country was able to completely recover a large-scale modern factory. From an industrialization point of view, it can be considered a gratifying thing. People who visit this factory are probably bound to have this feeling!</p>
<p>After the Yongli Ammonia Factory fell into enemy hands, the enemy attached considerable importance to it and actively used it. A group of Japanese engineers with very good standards participated in the work, and the dismantled parts were also repaired using Japanese methods. To this day, the Japanese-made hand-cranked centrifuge still remains in the ammonia factory as a souvenir of the enemy's occupation. The nitric acid factory's machines in the ammonia factory were dismantled by the enemy and transported to mainland Japan, because these machines were particularly sophisticated and their quality exceeded the enemy's own equipment. After Japan surrendered, these machines have been discovered. Yongli has now petitioned the government to forward the case to General MacArthur's headquarters to find a way to transport them back. At the same time, Yongli Ammonia Factory has opened a clear list of the losses during the war. In the future, it hopes to obtain a portion from the Japanese compensation amount and plans to send personnel to Japan to assist in the negotiations. This is a very reasonable request and should be supported by the government and society. However, judging from the Allied Headquarters' attitude towards Japan, it is questionable whether the compensation request can be achieved.</p>
<p>During the period of enemy occupation, the production volume of the ammonia factory was significantly reduced because the Yongli staff had dismantled some valuable parts when they evacuated. The enemy used the factory but did not cherish it. The reason was that the enemy knew that they could not occupy Central China for a long time and regard it as their own property, so they could not intentionally maintain and develop it. Therefore, the depreciation and loss rate of the ammonia factory in the past eight years has been particularly high. From January of this year, a full six months was used for repairs. The sulfuric acid factory only shipped goods on the 25th of last month. The high-pressure department is currently being tested, and full resumption of work should be around the 15th of next month. In each factory, traces of repairs can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>(III) Opening Up a Path</p>
<p>The Yongli Ammonia Factory has been moving towards the road to revival due to the enthusiasm and efforts of all the factory staff. However, due to the destruction of eight years, the vitality has been greatly damaged. According to a senior staff member, the daily production of sulfuric acid is about 60 tons. According to an engineering staff member, the maximum daily production of ammonia can reach 80 tons. According to responsible persons, the sales prospects are optimistic. The ammonia goods have not yet been released, but there are already many people placing orders. Taiwan needs fertilizer for fields in one year.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in Yongli's production now is the supply of raw materials, that is, coal is too difficult. They said that the ammonia factory needs to use more than 7,000 tons of coal per month, which is a considerable amount today. Because the Zhongfu Coal Mine and Zaozhuang Coal Mine are in the hands of the Communist army, coal from other regions cannot be supplied regularly for a long time. They had to seek it abroad. They ordered 8,000 tons of coal in Canada, and the price was more than 200,000 yuan per ton, plus freight and other expenses, costing more than 2 billion. Before starting work, Yongli Ammonia Factory's expenses were huge, and it could not be maintained without national subsidies. Recently, the Four Joint Treasury approved a loan of 3 billion yuan, 2 billion was released by the Bank of China, and the remaining 1 billion yuan was loaned by the Bank of Communications. This is a considerable industrial loan, and Yongli colleagues also admit that the country treats them differently. As for President Chiang himself, he also cares about Yongli from time to time. After returning to Nanjing, when summoning the military commander of the area, he frequently inquired about Yongli's recent situation and expressed his willingness to visit.</p>
<p>High prices are really a big obstacle to industrial production. In the ammonia factory, I saw magnetic cans for sulfuric acid, about two feet high and less than one foot in diameter, but their properties are special and not eroded by concentrated acid. They said that they cost more than 40,000 yuan per can, and you can't buy them even if you have the money! Wuhu's sand is also a necessity. There, one cubic meter costs 90,000 yuan, which is really shocking. The insurance period for the Yongli Ammonia Factory's machines has expired. They are now using them carefully, fearing that something will happen, but at this stage, there is no question of re-equipping. I asked them: Do you hope to borrow money from the country again? The answer was that borrowing money is not a solution because the interest is too high. They hope to open up sales channels, which is the real way out. They deeply expressed their heartache about the current situation and transportation conditions, believing that they can strangle industry!</p>
<p>(IV) Equipment in the Factory</p>
<p>The Yongli Ammonia Factory is located in Xiejiadian, Pukou, about forty miles away from Xiaguan, and can be reached by boat in forty minutes downstream. The factory site covers an area of more than 1,000 acres and includes various important parts such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia, high-pressure, gas, foundry, repair, civil engineering, and water refining plants. The distance between each plant is very large, which is a major reason for the lack of major losses from air raids. There are currently more than 200 employees and about 1,500 workers in the factory. In addition, there are two American engineers, in the name of consultants, one of whom is an old friend of Mr. Fan Xudong and has worked in the Yongli Company for more than ten years. Although the design of the ammonia factory was presided over by American engineers, the machines are not entirely American goods. The standard for purchasing them is entirely based on quality and characteristics. Therefore, within one factory, there are machines produced in four or five countries. In the high-pressure department, I saw the synthesizer from the United States and the compressor from Germany, as well as goods from Sweden and the United Kingdom. The engineering staff in the factory told me that even though it has been eight years, if this factory were moved to a foreign country, it would still be a new factory in terms of machinery and equipment, and its products would not be inferior to others.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of this factory is stability. The workers have not had any labor disputes. The reasons for this are, first, the treatment is reasonable, and wages are adjusted according to the index at any time; however, the biggest reason is that the welfare is well-managed, and technical workers can be assigned family dormitories. I visited the single workers' dormitory, and the building, light, and air in the rooms are probably better than the residences of some public school staff in Nanjing. As for the welfare of the staff, it is certainly managed even better. Yongli's staff has never shared dividends, and the treatment is not as good as state-owned enterprises, but it can make the staff work with peace of mind and not be tempted to move to other places. Well-managed welfare has a great relationship. Another important reason is that Mr. Fan Xudong's personality is noble and his leadership is effective. He was the cohesive force for uniting Yongli when he was alive, and the staff of Yongli still miss him today. This old industrialist expressed during the War of Resistance that he wanted to build a factory with a daily output of 1,300 tons of acid after the war. He believed that this production number was most suitable for China's needs. On the eve of the victory, President Chiang summoned him several times, hoping that he could run ten more modern factories for the country and asked him to prepare more. His early death was a loss to the Yongli factory and a loss to society. According to my intuition, Mr. Fan's memories are still Yongli's cohesive force and driving force today.</p>
<p>There is a hospital in the factory. The green walls are very pleasing to the eye and give people a quiet feeling. There is a primary school for the children of the employees to attend school for free, and it also enrolls the children of poor people nearby for free. The factory also has a farm, which is used for experiments. The fertilizer produced in the factory is first tested on this farm to test its power.</p>
<p>(V) Business Prospects</p>
<p>The overall business prospects of Yongli are very bright and optimistic. One reason is the soundness of its own conditions, and the second is that it has established international and domestic credibility, making it easier to obtain sympathy and assistance for both maintenance and development. From the United States, they have already obtained a loan of 16 million US dollars. The purpose is to designate the development of the alkali industry. Yongli is preparing to use this as capital to build ten new factories, focusing on Zhuzhou, Hunan, purchasing 3,000 acres of land to build seven new factories, and placing the remaining three factories and today's ammonia factory in one place. Yongli has a very sound business policy that is worth referring to by our country's industrial circles: their shareholders never share dividends, and if there are profits, they are used to expand the business. This kind of entrepreneurial spirit with a long-term vision is commendable. We study the history of China and Japan and find that Japan's industrial development was about the same time as ours, but today, the degree of industrialization in the two countries is very different. The reasons are certainly not just one end, but the lack of entrepreneurial spirit is indeed our major weakness. During the First World War, the textile industries of both countries had unprecedented prosperity, but Japanese textile mills set aside a particularly large public reserve fund, while Chinese textile mills focused on sharing dividends. As a result, when the trend of recession came, Japanese factories were still able to stand their ground, while Chinese factories collapsed at the first sign of trouble. Therefore, Yongli's style of valuing business over profit is worth greatly advocating in China.</p>
<p>When Mr. Fan Xudong was alive, the management of Yongli's business was based on people-oriented rather than law-oriented. There were no rigid written laws, but they were used freely and everything could be done. The responsibilities of each part of the company were not absolutely clearly defined, and there were no fixed rules for the appointment and protection of staff. However, under the guidance of Mr. Fan's selfless spirit, the internal personnel of the company were coordinated and full of vitality. Now that Mr. Fan has passed away, the need for the rule of law has begun to be felt. Yongli's business already has a grand scale and a long history. To carry it forward, it is not enough to rely solely on good traditions; systematization is the guarantee of success.</p>

<h3>Father's Day "Scholarship" Collective Donations Are More Effective</h3>
<p>The owner of the Jialin Loan Fund advocates raising more education and upbringing fees for the Xie family's children.</p>
<p>The main task of the Father's Day Promotion Committee this year is to raise scholarships. The more donations, the more impoverished children will benefit. The number of people responding in the past few days has been quite enthusiastic, but the amount of pledged donations is still limited. It is hoped that those who are well-fed and clothed will generously donate and that those who are enthusiastic about helping students will do their best to solicit donations. Whether they donate money or effort, their efforts to help students are equally effective. Speaking of commemorating fathers, since it is everyone's wish, wouldn't it be more worthy of fathers to donate a little money to help the orphaned and distressed youth? Not only should everyone think this way, but if every group, such as lines of shops and companies, commercial firms, factories, hometown associations, clubs... cooperated with the power of the majority, wouldn't it be easy to achieve? Therefore, I hope that donating scholarships for Father's Day must use the collective power to easily achieve results. I heard that the association plans to help 500 primary and secondary school students, requiring at least 50 million yuan, and hopes to achieve the goal in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The owner of the Jialin Loan Fund came to the museum in person yesterday. He was deeply moved by the proposal of the promotion committee to provide 1 million yuan for the education expenses of General Xie Jinyuan's children. He proposed that our newspaper set up a special column on the education fund for General Xie's children so that readers can donate according to their abilities with a spirit of self-motivation. He first donated 100,000 yuan as an initiative. With the approval of the authorities of our newspaper, we will follow Mr. Zhu's wishes. All readers who donate and designate it for the education expenses of General Xie's children can state it incidentally. Our newspaper will notify the promotion committee after collecting the donations, regardless of the amount, and handle it separately. It is indeed a good thing to commemorate Father's Day and help the descendants of the soldiers who resisted Japan. It is hoped that readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Reader Responses - Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Wu Shizeng asks the editor: I am a poor civil servant with a family of six to support. To make matters worse, my wife is suffering from an inexplicable ailment. Last month, she suddenly started vomiting and experiencing constipation. A traditional Chinese medicine practitioner diagnosed it as dampness obstructing the stomach and intestines, while a Western doctor diagnosed it as a gastrointestinal disease. After taking medication, she improved slightly, but to this day, her menstruation has not returned, she continues to vomit, feels discomfort in her chest when eating, often regurgitates acidic fluids, and has irregular bowel movements. She has become as thin as a rail. If this continues, I fear I will not be able to find a solution. If I were to seek further medical treatment, my financial resources would be insufficient. I have long admired your newspaper for benefiting the people and for employing medical consultants. I humbly submit this request, hoping you can provide guidance. I would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Your wife should first have her urine tested to determine if she is pregnant, and then have her stool examined to confirm what type of gastrointestinal disease she has.</p>
<p>(2) Zhou Xiaoyin asks: I read your newspaper, "Shen Bao," and found that the consultants provide many detailed solutions to readers' problems, benefiting humanity greatly and gaining widespread admiration. I have two questions and would like to request your assistance in answering them. In recent years, I have been deeply engrossed in medicine in my spare time, but I lack a good teacher and rely solely on self-study. However, this is only due to my personal interest and not a plan to practice medicine on others. I previously took a correspondence course in medicine from Mr. Zhang Zongxi and benefited greatly. Now that Mr. Zhang is no longer in Shanghai, I am relying on self-study. Knowing your enthusiasm for society, I implore you to provide more guidance.</p>
<p>Various medical communities worldwide have relied heavily on Sulfanilamide for saving lives, truly a boon for humanity. It has many derivatives, such as Sulfapyridine, Sulfathiazole, and others. Even Diafaguanai Ding has specific effects. However, I am unsure of the specific effects of Diafada Jing and Diafa Milajing, which are currently available in the market. Which types of bacteria are they most effective against? I implore you to provide detailed information on the efficacy of Diafada Jing and Diafa Milajing, which I will never forget. Also, please recommend relevant Chinese books, newspapers, and publications (medical category).</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] Sulfadiazine is extremely effective in killing gonococci, staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and other bacteria. Its efficacy is similar to Sulfathiazole, but its toxicity is lower. Sulfameazine has similar efficacy, but its toxicity to the human body is even lower. Some readily available periodical Chinese medical publications include the Chinese Medical Journal and Social Hygiene.</p>
<p>(3) Qian Tingxi asks: Last winter night, I was robbed and fled in panic. Unfortunately, I fell from the roof and was injured. Although I have recovered, the doctor did not examine whether my reproductive organs were injured. Therefore, even though I am physically healed, I have completely lost my sexual desire and urinate more frequently. This has been going on for half a year. I am concerned about the potential impact on the issue of inheritance. I dare to humbly ask the following questions for your guidance: (1) What is the reason for the loss of sexual desire? (2) Can it be cured, and what are the methods? (3) If left untreated, is there any hope for improvement?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Shenming answers] Your condition is likely caused by nerve damage to the sexual organs due to the fall. A thorough examination is required before treatment can begin.</p>
<h3>Jialin Scholarship Association Continues to Support the Orphan and Widow Fund</h3>
<p>Advocating for Continued Support to Help People in Need</p>
<p>Having read in your column, "Appeal to All Sectors to Donate to the Qingxia Elderly Orphan and Poor Relief Fund," I learned that the remaining funds are only 130,000 yuan, while the needs of the applicants are very great. Our organization also hopes that the relief fund will continue to be held to meet urgent needs. Therefore, we are sending an additional check for 100,000 yuan to be included in the management of the fund. Shen Bao Social Service Column Jialin Scholarship Office, August 3.

<h3>How to Handle Children of Divorced Parents?</h3>
<p>— Not Yet 成 (Cheng)</p>
<p>My younger brother came back from a friend's house and told me, "The little sister in that family said to me, 'None of you men are any good.'"</p>
<p>It's a terrible thing for a little girl of just over six years old to utter such words as "None of you men are any good!" It's not just terrible that she said the words, but that she even has such an extreme view in her mind!</p>
<p>Where does this view come from? I firmly believe it comes from her mother. I know the details of her family situation. This child's mother is the passive party in the divorce. After the divorce, the child is raised by the mother. Moreover, I once heard her mother say with my own ears, "There are no good men!"</p>
<p>Divorce, when a couple absolutely cannot continue living together, is an enlightened, correct, and wise decision. However, we believe that the reasons for divorce are often due to incompatibility in the sexual lives of the couple, often with a third party involved, and rarely without some sexual issues. To put it plainly, it is caused by one of the spouses having found someone else they love. The one who has found someone else becomes cold, even disgusted, towards their original spouse, which inevitably leads to jealousy and so-called "green-eyed monster" in the other spouse. Disgust, jealousy, and some unimportant factors add up to arguments, which is the "incompatible views," and "difficult to grow old together" mentioned above. Therefore, in a divorce, there must be one party who is proactive and another who is passive. - Here, "proactive" does not refer to the one who says "Let's get a divorce" first, and "passive" does not refer to the one who says "Fine, let's get a divorce." Here, the proactive party refers to the one who truly caused the divorce - the proactive party only feels that the previous one could not satisfy them, that this new one must be the best, and that they will be completely satisfied when they become a couple - in reality, this is rarely the case, but that is what they think at the time. What about the passive party, the one who is abandoned? Their first feelings are sadness, disappointment, and jealousy! ... These feelings trigger the "lost dream," the memories of past tenderness, sweet talk, and sweetness flood the brain, and they feel that their spouse is unreliable, that everything before was just a scam! And so, from the depths of their heart, a kind of uncontrollable emotion erupts: hatred. They hate not only their fate, but also their own foolishness and stupidity, their spouse's lover, and especially their own spouse! Hatred needs to be vented! The strong will devote themselves to their careers or start a dissolute life, while the weak will begin to sink: chanting Buddhist scriptures, believing in Jesus... or even committing suicide. There are also some who find an object: their own child. (If the child is left with them.) This is especially common with women. They tell the child things that make them hate their husband. It's still alright if the child is older, but if the child is still young, it's terrible! The child's spirit and mind are immediately injured, not just slightly, but with a lifelong mental disability if not treated early.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, divorce is ultimately an unfortunate thing. But we cannot, and should not, allow the aftermath of this misfortune to strike or kill their children even more heavily! - Like the girl mentioned above, she may distrust men for the rest of her life and even develop abnormal ideas about remaining single!</p>
<p>So, how should we handle the children of divorced parents?</p>
<p>We believe that the love of parents for their children is the most precious thing. A child who does not receive or lacks the love of their parents - especially maternal love - is the most unfortunate person in the world. Their spirit and mind rarely have no defects or abnormalities. Therefore, we do not advocate completely cutting off contact between the child and their parents! But we also do not advocate treating the child as a compensation item, the solution, "Alright, you are too sad, I'll give you the child." We cannot sacrifice the child for our own satisfaction in taking a step back, we would rather sacrifice ourselves to ensure the child's well-being! The psychology of the abandoned is always abnormal. Abnormal psychology produces abnormal love and abnormal education. The result of the child suffering from these influences is a sickness - the above is one example. Based on this, we do not agree with giving the child to the abandoned party.</p>
<p>If the proactive party in the divorce is the woman, this is suitable. Not only has her psychology not changed significantly, but she also continues to love her child. And her "new husband" will never object in order to please his beloved wife. Even if she has other children, it will still be the same, because these are all children she gave birth to herself.</p>
<p>However, if the proactive party in the divorce is the man, should we give the child to the man? We dare not say. A father rarely gives full consideration to his children after remarrying, and the stepmother, who has more contact with the child, only has a nominal relationship with the child. She will not love the child, especially after she has her own children! Discrimination and inequality are common occurrences! These things will cause the child, especially a male child, to develop a similar view to the one mentioned above: "Women are terrible, because Mom was like that." So, who should we give the child to?</p>
<p>Mr. S said: It's best to give the child to a childless widow to raise. This might be a possible solution, but there aren't that many widows, nor is it that convenient. Moreover, widow should only be a temporary title, it should not be a person's lifelong pronoun! She should remarry.</p>
<p>The handling of children of divorced parents is an extremely important matter! It should never be decided casually, just based on "mutual agreement" of who should raise them! Because the child's future is too seriously affected! We need to find the most ideal solution. Do advanced readers also have valuable insights?</p>
<h3>He Loves Mom More - The Miss Dix Advice Column</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren (Steel Man)</p>
<p>Dear Miss Dix:</p>
<p>A woman who has just become a bride should be extremely happy, and I am no exception, except for the one thing I am telling you now.</p>
<p>My husband's mother died not long before our marriage. He told me about this, saying that if his mother hadn't died, he would only want to be with his mother and never marry. He even said: He loves his mother much more than he loves me!</p>
<p>It is this that makes me feel sad, because I should hope that I occupy the first position in his heart. Therefore, can you tell me what I should do?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Rand Shang (Rand Up)</p>
<p>Mrs. Rand:</p>
<p>You should be able to use some common sense to stop yourself from creating worry and feeling sad. If it weren't for your husband's steadfast love for his dead mother, you would not have a worse thing in your life to give you something to chew on, you'd be bored quickly.</p>
<p>But I think your husband's comparison of his love for his mother and his love for you is just as wrong and almost foolish as your constant complaint that your husband loves his mom more. Because a man shouldn't compare his love for his mother and his love for his wife; because these are completely two different things, different in both form and nature.</p>
<p>Before his mother died, your husband would have decided not to marry because he hadn't met a woman he felt he loved more deeply.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you can go along the path he wants to take, he will soon feel that his mother's love is not completely satisfying and that he needs a woman's caress.</p>
<p>His stubbornness about his love has become a kind of "disease plagued by demons," just because his mother has died. He overestimates his mother as being so great, so idealized. Therefore, you must never argue with him incessantly over this, showing jealousy or disgust, and should use a more proper method to guide your husband onto the path he should be on. So, you should happily and wisely accept the current situation.</p>
<p>This acceptance is without loss and does not make you lose anything; also, it is more foolish than anything else to continue to create worry for yourself at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>Happily and delightfully give your husband consideration and caresses! Your husband will soon change his prejudice of "seemingly sacred and inviolable ideal love" and return to normal!</p>

<h3>The Unpaid Worker</h3>
<p>— Xin (New)</p>
<p>For days, I have been reading Mr. Zhou Shoujuan's "Remembering My Deceased Wife, Fengjun," which has given me a deep feeling. In every corner of China, I don't know how many people like Fengjun continue to work hard and take on complaints, arranging comfortable daily routines for their husbands, enabling them to devote their entire spirit to society and step by step climb to a lofty position. They also do their utmost to educate the country's second generation, creating new talents for the future of the country. They have no name, do not compete for profit, sacrifice personal enjoyment, and just silently, silently, tirelessly, and faithfully serve their families, giving their all and dying only after exhausting their efforts.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Establish a home and start a career," which precisely illustrates that starting a career requires the help of a wife. However, society oppresses the status of housewives very low. Even with the women's movement fully underway now, housewives are still being neglected, and some men who don't know the immensity of heaven and earth say that housewives are parasites. I think that if all the housewives in China were to stage a general strike, I wonder if the men would still be able to comfortably and peacefully go to their offices?</p>
<p>Recently, the administrative authorities in Taiwan issued an order prohibiting the family members of civil servants from riding in government cars. It's unimaginable that housewives are so despised. It's said to be for saving government gasoline. But what if the people sitting in the car are unrelated male friends of the civil servant? Does that mean men sitting in the car will reduce gasoline consumption?</p>
<p>Housewives work diligently all day, but society doesn't give them a second glance. Their only hope is to work hard to make their husband's career flourish. By the time their husband has a government car to ride in, he will at least be a senior official or a head of a department. If this were in England, they could have bought several cars themselves long ago. But Chinese official salaries are so meager that it's probably impossible to even hire a maid to share the labor. It's rare to be able to ride in a government car, but even that is prohibited by the government. My husband does not have the qualification to have a government car assigned to him, but I hope that the government will respect these unpaid housewives, at least until the country has universally established nurseries, as they are the sole protectors of the second generation. — Sent from Taipei</p>

<h3>Glass Slippers (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Chi Zhao</p>
<p>Zheng Xia, that nineteen-year-old girl, after graduating from the ×× Church School, came to the Document Section of the ×× Bureau as a staff member in early spring this year.</p>
<p>Although there were quite a few female staff in the ×× Bureau, none of them could attract attention like her. Before she had been at the bureau for three months, she had already become "a household name," and sometimes even became the subject of discussion among her colleagues.</p>
<p>Although she was a staff member, she only did typing work. She wasn't the only female typist, but she was more idle than the others. When she was free, she would chat about everything under the sun. With her around, the cold and lonely office was like a water lily blooming in winter. It was said that she would sometimes sit on the section chief's desk and laugh with her waist bent. She had a personal connection with the section chief, so he introduced her to play a supporting role.</p>
<p>She had dimples, Parisian-style red lips, bright eyes, and a height of four feet seven inches, weighing one hundred and sixteen pounds. Her mother also liked to dress her up, which was said to be the reason why she was so likable.</p>
<p>On the first Monday morning of early summer, Zheng Xia walked to the bureau as usual. As soon as she stepped into the gate, the sound of crisp "click-clack-click" footsteps on the cement floor made people think of the rhythm of a foxtrot on the dance floor. She raised her head, straightened her chest, and walked into the document section, slightly lifting her upper lip to reveal neat teeth, as a greeting to her colleagues.</p>
<p>The office began to come alive, and everyone put their official business on the table, chatting for a while first.</p>
<p>"Miss Zheng, you're wearing new shoes today without reporting it to everyone, you should be fined," said Xiao Chen, who was quick-mouthed and quick-eyed, discovering it during the chat.</p>
<p>Zheng Xia just pursed her lips, turned her head and smiled, and her dimples reappeared.</p>
<p>"Oh! They're American goods, glass slippers!" Lao Qin, who shared a desk with Xiao Chen and sat opposite him, seemed to have seen a miracle.</p>
<p>This news caused a sensation throughout the office. The women cast envious glances, and the men took the opportunity to admire her. Zheng Xia was surrounded by men and women.</p>
<p>"I've heard of them, but I'm only seeing them today."</p>
<p>"I think this is the first pair discovered here."</p>
<p>"You don't read the newspapers, the newspapers say that ×× wore the first pair."</p>
<p>"I thought they were transparent, but now they look just like ordinary ones."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The tea boy came in and said that the section chief had arrived and was accompanied by the director, which stopped the floating air and made everyone return to their seats and quietly grab their official business to handle.</p>
<p>Hearing that the director had come, Zheng Xia felt that she had nothing to do, so she cleverly grabbed another document from Miss Pan to type.</p>
<p>The director, with a cigar in his mouth, walked in with a smiling section chief. The staff stood up and nodded as a sign of respect, then lowered their heads to work. In the rather quiet atmosphere, only the sound of typewriters and the movement of Zheng Xia's glass slippers, more like a ticking sound, made her feel several gazes shooting at her, making her usually accustomed posture seem clumsy.</p>
<p>After the director's cigar smoke circled the entire room, he said, "Section Chief Guan, I currently need a typist there, just pick one from your section!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, Miss Pan is the most hardworking, so let's transfer her to the director's office!" The section chief, with his left hand behind his back, bent over, pointing at Miss Pan with his right hand.</p>
<p>Miss Pan, who wore glasses, was surprised and delighted, and leaned forward to stand up, but the director did not respond, but silently stroked his cheek, grabbed his chin, and his eyes darted elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Oh! I forgot, Miss Zheng is also very good, let Miss Zheng go to the director's office." Seeing the director's eyes on Zheng Xia, the section chief cleverly changed his words.</p>
<p>"That's how it's done!" The director spat out a mouthful of thick smoke and left.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes," the section chief felt a sour feeling rising in his nose.</p>
<p>Xiao Chen and Lao Qin squeezed their eyes and exchanged a knowing look, but Miss Pan's face flushed red, not knowing what to do, and in the end, she sat down and continued typing with her head down.</p>
<p>The next day, Zheng Xia stepped into the gate of ×× Bureau, and the click-clack-click sound echoed on the escalator, and she walked towards the director's office.</p>
<p>"The glass slippers have been promoted!" The colleagues whispered, and from then on, Zheng Xia had an elegant nickname of "Glass Slippers."</p>
<p>She walked to the door of the office, carefully lightened her footsteps, knocked on the door and went in. She saw that the director was already there, smoking a cigar. She felt embarrassed and her face flushed red. She looked down at her watch.</p>
<p>"Director, good morning." She stood in front of the director's desk, bending over slightly.</p>
<p>"It's really early, it's not even office hours yet!" Hearing the director's gentle tone, her uneasy heart calmed down.</p>
<p>"Miss Zheng, please sit down, let's talk first."</p>
<p>She sat on the chair next to the desk, but only sat half of her buttocks. The director sprayed a puff of smoke into the air, put the cigarette butt in the ashtray and said:</p>
<p>"Miss Zheng, where did you study?"</p>
<p>"I went to ×× School."</p>
<p>"Was it co-educational?" The director's expression seemed a little nervous. "No, it was a girls' school." She cleverly emphasized the word "girls."</p>
<p>"Good, good, have you worked there before?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"This is good too. Good, Miss Zheng, just help me here, this is your desk," the director pointed to her.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Director!" Zheng Xia felt relaxed again, and her two dimples reappeared. With a click-clack-click sound, she walked to her desk. The director greedily watched her back, "Well-deserved reputation," flickering in his mind.</p>
<p>Zheng Xia sat in the director's office for three days and handled many complex official and private matters. These days, her mother dressed her up even more neatly, and she always remembered the words her mother had told her, but she felt that the opportunity to mature had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>It was Friday, I think. The afternoon office hours were over, and the other staff had slipped away, but Zheng Xia's typing work today was busier than usual, so she couldn't go back, and the director was sitting there without leaving, as if waiting for her official business to be completed that day. After he handed it in, he breathed a sigh of relief and looked at his watch, it was almost seven o'clock.</p>
<p>"You did it very well, but it was hard on Miss Zheng, good, for the merit award, I'll take Miss Zheng out to dinner," the director said, looking at the official documents and glancing at her.</p>
<p>Click-clack-click, the sound of Zheng Xia and the director walking down the escalator of ×× Bureau, dudu dudu, the car drove towards the downtown area.</p>
<p>After dinner, the director and Zheng Xia appeared in ×× Ballroom, because he had learned that she could "bounce" during dinner, which made the director even happier.</p>
<p>"The Whistle in the Dark," this jazz score that had been played in the ballroom for more than ten years, was now being replayed. Under the dim lights, the dance floor was crowded with couples, and he and she were one of them.</p>
<p>Gently, she leaned against his chest, and her nose only smelled the stench of cigars. He hugged her tightly, and she felt his heart pounding rapidly. The shyness of a young girl could not help but push him away slightly.</p>
<p>"Are you having fun dancing?" he said greedily.</p>
<p>"Uh," dimples reappeared on her face, but her chest was further away from him.</p>
<p>"Oh, you also said just now, what does your father do?"</p>
<p>"My dad 'measures roads' for the city government," she smiled, revealing neat teeth.</p>
<p>"You're really clever, and you can talk," he also spewed out the smell of stinky smoke from his mouth, causing her to turn her back.</p>
<p>"Please help me, Director, find a job for my dad."</p>
<p>"What does your father want to do?"</p>
<p>"Investigation Section Chief," she said, leaning against his chest, a heat warming his whole body.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" He only made a heavy tone in contemplation.</p>
<p>"Director, will you help?" She moved her chest away from him again.</p>
<p>"Hmm! Hmm! Okay, let's do it this way!" They danced even more vigorously.</p>
<p>On Saturday, ×× Bureau had a partial change. Hu Dayue, the original investigation section chief, was promoted to commissioner, and Zheng Shide was appointed as the section chief.</p>
<p>After getting off work, Zheng Xia click-clack-click walked home, revealing the dimples on her face. She first told her parents the news of the appointment, saying that Dad could go to work on Monday, which made her mother exclaim:</p>
<p>"Good girl, you finally found a way out for Dad, and it's not in vain that Mom and Dad raised you and loved you."</p>
<p>Her dad was silent at first, feeling guilty in his heart, but when he pondered the benefits of that position, he couldn't help but show a smile against his will.</p>
<p>Then, Zheng Xia was busy dressing up again, saying that the director was taking her to dinner again tonight, which made her dad blush and put away his smile, but Mom helped her pack.</p>
<p>Zheng Xia didn't come home until Sunday morning. She only nodded when she met her parents, and the room suddenly showed an unharmonious atmosphere. Dad's face was gloomy, and Mom was speechless. In the end, Mom pushed her into the room. When she got into the room, her virgin heart, which had not yet been extinguished, made her hatefully take off the glass slippers and still keep them far away.

<h3>Paul Bourget (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>Paul Bourget was born on September 2, 1852, in Amiens, Somme, France. His father, Justin Bourget, was a Bachelor of Science, his grandfather was a civil engineer, and his great-grandfather was a farmer. On the maternal side, his mother was from Lorraine, and her bloodline clearly had German ancestry. At the time of his birth, his father was a mathematics teacher at Somme High School, and later successively transferred to Strasbourg, Clermont, and Clermont-Ferrand, where he served as a professor at the Faculty of Science. Bourget's education began in Clermont-Ferrand. Later, his father became the principal of Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris, and he also transferred to this high school to study. From the age of five or six, he began to read the works of Shakespeare and Scott, and at the age of fifteen he read two volumes of poetry by Alfred de Musset, and all of Balzac's novels, as well as part of Stendhal's novels. He graduated from high school in 1872 and entered the University of Paris to study Greek philology. After leaving university, he worked as a private tutor, and began his literary life at that time. In 1894, he succeeded Maxima du Camp as the president of the Académie Française, until his death in Paris on December 25, 1935, at the age of eighty-three.</p>
<p>Bourget, like most men of letters, began his literary life with poetry. His earliest works were collections of philosophical poetry with strong classical colors (Poesie philosophique), including: By the Sea (Au bord de la mer 1875), Restless Life (La vie inquiete 1875), Edel (Edel 1878) and Confessions (Les aveux 1882). These collections of poems were influenced by Musset, Sully Prudhomme, Baudelaire, and the contemporary (around 1875) French perception of English Lake Poets. In terms of poetic value, these poems are not very high, their greater value lies in psychology. In these collections of poems, Bourget tried his best to combine his admiration for Byron and Barbey d’Aurevilly, and his personal interest in applying delicate analysis to modern life. The titles of the first two collections of poems, By the Sea and Restless Life, clearly express this duality, showing his desire to discover a deep psychological foundation beneath the most adorned upper class society. Because the power of the mind and the passion for knowledge dominated his heart, poetry was not very suitable for him. He was a disciple of Taine and Fustel de Coulanges; in addition to enjoying Stendhal's psychological novels, he gradually focused on psychological analysis, publishing some critical research articles between 1883 and 1886. His essays, Contemporary Psychological Essays (Essais de psycholog·contemporaine 1883) and New Essays (Nouveaux Essais 1885), were an excellent harvest in the critical world at that time. He selected more than a dozen modern French writers, such as Baudelaire, Renan, Flaubert, Stendhal, Taine, Dumas fils, Leconte de Lisle, the Goncourt brothers, etc., to study the trends of modern people's psychology, and the state of the feelings of a generation; the method was rigorous, the content was accurate, and it could accurately point out the direction of the spiritual world at the end of the nineteenth century. This book has new evaluations and unique insights, so Bourget became known as a critic, but his true talent was not revealed by this. While continuing to write critical essays such as Studies and Portraits (Etudes et portraits 1888), he also moved the same research into novels and dramas, thus producing Cruel Enigma (Cruelle Enigme 1885), A Crime of Love (Un crim d'amour 1886), Lies (Mensonges 1888), etc. In these works, he was only looking for his personal expression. The spirit of psychological analysis that he could not fully express in his poems and essays began to develop greatly in novels. In these novels, the talents of psychologists and poets are expressed simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Idealism and Realism: Where is Chinese Painting Heading?</h3>
<p>— Shi Liangfu</p>
<p>Painting is a visual art. Its initial creation stems from the inspiration people gain from the beauty of objects, using artistic techniques to express it as a personal form of entertainment. There is no so-called theoretical philosophical basis. This is especially true for Chinese painting, which has been budding, growing, flourishing, and continuing to exist. Although it also has many schools like Western painting, it does not categorize and set its creative standards entirely based on its starting points, like Western painting. Instead, it is distinguished based on the similarity of its expressions.</p>
<p>As Chinese painting has developed to this day, the situation seems to be somewhat different. Due to the influence of war on this generation of young painters—on the battlefield, in occupied areas, and in the rear—some paintings reflecting the tragic and heroic realities have emerged. As a result, some people are advocating realism, treating it in the same way as Western painting. They believe that Chinese painting should also emphasize the depiction of real life, like Japanese Ukiyo-e. At the same time, within this wave of discussion, some are also shouting: "Art is the embodiment of the spirit, especially Chinese painting, which takes 'Qi Yun Sheng Dong' (spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality) as its highest pursuit. Its style, strength, bone structure, form, and vitality are all expressions of romanticism. Therefore, Chinese painting should be based on idealism as its theoretical foundation." As a result, contemporary Chinese painting has inevitably been drawn into the vortex of the two major theories of realism and idealism.</p>
<p>So, who is the fundamental for Chinese painting theory: realism or idealism? Here, from a third-party perspective, let's make a brief analysis of the two viewpoints:</p>
<p>Advocates of realism believe that human spiritual abilities and cognitive abilities develop historically, and that various spiritual abilities take objective reality as their object. Especially painting, which is a visual art, creates a type, summarizing the essential and characteristic elements of a certain objective reality, and then synthesizing and concretizing it to form a type that can represent that kind of reality. It lies in expressing the typical character within the typical situation. Furthermore, because art is objective, and this objectivity determines subjectivity, artists only need to faithfully imitate nature, and appreciators can naturally grasp the nature being imitated and have the same interest as the creator. The root of this interest lies in the nature of reality itself. That is to say, the reason art is art lies in imitating the "truth" of nature. Therefore, visual art starts with realism as its theoretical basis.</p>
<p>Conversely, advocates of idealism believe that the task of art is not purely to reflect reality, but to create beauty through the self's spirit. Since it is the creation of beauty, it is a product of the spirit. Products of the spirit are neither produced by nature nor are they objective things. Therefore, there is no so-called objectivity in art. Appreciators can have the same interest as the creator due to the resonance of beautiful emotions. It is the spirit moving the spirit. In other words, the reason art is art lies in the beautiful emotions and aesthetic experience. This kind of beautiful emotion produces different expressive techniques. These different techniques are the different inspirations of the painters. Because of the differences in inspiration, painters cannot faithfully depict things in the same way like cameras. Therefore, this kind of beautiful inspiration and aesthetic experience are the starting points of painting.</p>
<p>In summary, we know that the conclusions of the two are: "Do not impose preconceived notions on reality, depict reality as it is, and such a creative attitude is realism." "Impose preconceived notions on reality, and then judge or abandon reality, and such a creative attitude is called idealism."</p>
<p>So, to which school does the tradition and current situation of Chinese painting belong? What is its theoretical starting point? We believe that although our ancestors in the art world have never mentioned the eight characters of idealism and realism in their art theories, we can easily find some theoretical basis in the Six Principles and in fragmented art theories. The Six Principles of Xie He of the Southern Qi Dynasty are the eternal constitution of Chinese painting. From copying and transferring, arranging positions, depicting colors according to types, depicting forms according to objects, using the brush with bone method, to achieving spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality, the arrangement of these six principles is equivalent to the ranking of the work's value. Spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality is praised as the ultimate in Chinese painting. The expression of this kind of spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality can be said to be the expression of subjective art. Just as Zhang Yanyuan commented on Wu Daozi, he said: "Guarding his spirit, focusing on the one, combining the skill of creation, borrowing Wu Sheng's brush, the so-called intention precedes the brush, the painting exhausts the intention. Using ink brush and ruler is dead brushwork. Guarding his spirit and focusing on the one is truthfulness. What is the point of a wall full of dead paintings? A single stroke of a true brush shows its vitality. When one thinks and wields the brush, if one thinks of it as painting, then one becomes obsessed with painting. If the intention is not on the painting, then one achieves it. It does not stagnate in the hand, does not congeal in the heart, and is naturally so. Even when bending a bow, extending a blade, erecting pillars, or constructing beams, how can ink brush and ruler be involved?" This means that painting should not only be confined to traces, but also should not be confused by brushstrokes. Furthermore, Dong Yougou said, "Hills and valleys are formed in the mind, and when one understands, one expresses them in painting. Therefore, objects leave traces, and scenes arise with vision, almost in harmony with heaven." These two statements advocate first gaining from reality and then abandoning it, and then expressing freely, so that the spirit, essence, and interest will naturally flow out. In addition, Su Dongpo said, "To discuss painting in terms of formal likeness is to be neighbors with children." Ni Yunlin said, "What I call painting is just a casual stroke, not seeking formal likeness, just to amuse myself." Yan Yuan also said, "If one gets the formal likeness, then one loses the spiritual consonance; if one has all the colors, then one loses the brushwork." Du Gongbu criticized and satirized Han Gan's lifelike paintings of "horses"! He wrote a poem: "The disciple Han Gan entered the studio early and could also paint horses in all their special features. Han only paints flesh but not bones, how can he bear to let the Hua Liu (a famous horse) lose its spirit?" From the tone of these representative writers, one can get a glimpse of the theory of Chinese painting—mostly emphasizing spiritual likeness over formal likeness.</p>
<p>However, does the emphasis on spiritual likeness in Chinese painting completely obliterate reality like the Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists? Not at all! Let's take the "Six Principles" as an example: in the Six Principles, spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality, and using the brush with bone method are subjective and spiritual, while depicting forms according to objects and depicting colors according to types are objective and realistic. Arranging positions is subjective and spiritual, while copying and transferring are objective and realistic. Secondly, Dai Wenjie said, "Painting must have seven conditions: one, refined emotions; two, harmony between brush and hand; three, pure colors and ink; four, new travels in mountains and waters (or new seeing of famous works); five, the person requesting the painting is a good connoisseur; six, inspiration; seven, skill should be in the state of neither unfamiliar nor overly familiar. Only when the seven conditions are met can a good composition be created." Furthermore, the six strengths, six essentials, eight styles, three faults, and twelve avoidances in painting methods all serve as warnings to painters that they should pay attention to the interrelationship of creation in the heavens and on earth, and that a certain period and a certain region cannot be confused (such as no willows on high mountains, no pine trees on beaches, etc.). From these perspectives, although Chinese painting is somewhat biased towards subjective idealism, it does not completely obliterate reality, but rather attaches considerable importance to reality. Mr. Jiang Xizeng said, "According to the principle of painting, it is nothing more than the harmony of spirit and form. The two cannot be neglected. If there is form without spirit, then the form is a dead thing. If there is spirit without form, then the spirit has nothing to rely on, that is, there is no way to express it. The Chinese painting theory of spiritual consonance and lifelike vitality can be said to coincide with this. The so-called 'learn from creation externally, and obtain from the mind internally' is also." This also illustrates the inseparability of the subjective and the objective, and that matter and spirit complement each other and are mutually causal. Therefore, the creation of a genius artist not only does not violate the typicality of objective reality through subjective action, but also strengthens the typicality of objective reality. This is something that realists cannot deny.</p>
<p>The above is our citation and analysis of the two. Here, I will further discuss my opinion on this issue: The production of Chinese painting differs from that of Europe due to our "nationality," "locality," "production tools," "creative methods," and the connection between Chinese culture (especially poetry, calligraphy, etc.) and philosophical thought with painting, which differs from that of Western countries. Therefore, Chinese painting and Western painting cannot be mentioned in the same breath or spoken of on the same day. Let's comment on the works of writers who currently advocate becoming closer to realism: Yesterday, the YMCA in the city of Baxianqiao held an exhibition of Situ Qiao's disaster paintings. Except for three or four pieces of misty rivers and mountains, all the works depict the tragic living conditions of the victims in the disaster area. It can be said that they completely reflect objective reality, exposing the ugly reality and the cruel reality, and express extreme dissatisfaction with reality. In terms of its effect, it is undeniable that it has a sharp stimulating effect. All viewers who enter the exhibition feel pity and sadness. However, in terms of the intrinsic value of art itself, it cannot be regarded as a great and successful work, because the ugliness of its content covers up the beauty of its technique, causing people to feel disgust with reality, and it cannot evoke an incomparably comfortable sense of "beauty." If this is the case, then what is the purpose of artistic creation? If it is said to be used as a political tool or a means of arousing emotions, wouldn't the scenes taken by a camera be more real and more moving? Although its content and tone, composition, decoration, and style are all traditional national forms, viewers can only regard it as a quick sketch or caricature of Western painting, and cannot regard it as a representative work of the New Chinese Painting Movement.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocated "replacing religion with aesthetic education," believing that religion still cannot break away from the words "profit and harm" in action, and only art can beautify life and moral life. If all mankind replaced religion with aesthetic education, the world would be unified. Therefore, I believe that art should not be used as a political tool or a means of arousing emotions, but should use its beauty to comfort life and beautify life.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is a peace-loving and indifferent nation, rich in the habit of containing and assimilating. Especially in painting, it can best express its latent and rich national spirit, a kind of plain and innocent sentiment, which makes people feel relaxed, calm, and detached from the world at first glance. Therefore, reacting to objective reality and exposing the ugly straight state of life are not what Chinese painting seeks. From these perspectives, we can say that the revival movement of Chinese painting cannot take realism as its theoretical starting point, and absolute idealism cannot grasp this revival movement either. The true theoretical basis is still the harmony of the subjective and the objective, not absolutely belonging to either side.</p>

<h3>School Scarcity</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a news feature on page four entitled "Difficulty in Taking Entrance Exams." The education authorities are not unaware of this situation, and perhaps know it even more deeply than we do. However, knowing is one thing, and actively seeking solutions is another. Therefore, I am willing to tirelessly make an urgent appeal to the authorities on behalf of these out-of-school youths who are wandering and hesitating without access to schools.</p>
<p>Several of the better schools (including those with good curriculum, good management, or good facilities) are either not enrolling or have extremely limited enrollment quotas. During this period, the parents of many students are truly distraught over this issue, seeking favors and pleading everywhere. I have written several letters and made several phone calls for friends.</p>
<p>At first, when friends asked me to do this, I politely declined. I said, "If your son's grades are good, he will naturally have the ability to pass the exam. I cannot help you by speaking on behalf of someone who is cheating, and even if speaking on behalf of someone is effective, it is not a good thing for your son, because it plants a thought of taking private gain as public in his pure mind. Human relations and relationships have manipulated society, and our generation has already suffered from it. How can we allow it to continue to spread?" My friend agreed with my theory, but he said, "I know that using this method is unreasonable and harmful to my own children, but I can't help it. Please ask, if there are two or three thousand applicants and only two or three hundred are admitted, often less than one-tenth, my child is not the most outstanding, but I am confident that he is above average, but if he encounters the same exam scores, it is very likely that he will fail without asking for favors because of the quota. " I could not deny the reason for my friend's reply, so I could not help but write a letter of request for my friend. This phenomenon is too sad. It seems that only the phrase "drinking poison to quench thirst" can be compared.</p>
<p>There are so many seekers of education and so few schools, and the lives of teachers are so poor that they cannot eat their fill and keep warm, and the mission of education is shouldering such a heavy responsibility to build the country. Who is to blame for a series of contradictions and the most tragic and ridiculous situation?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, there is too little education funding.</p>
<h3>Fortune Telling and Face Reading</h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>There are many fortune tellers and physiognomists in our country who add the beautiful title of "philosopher" to their names, as if it is not enough to show their skills without calling themselves "philosophical fortune telling." To say that "fortune tellers" (whether this term can be established is of course still a question) are "philosophers" is really a "gimmick" as Shanghai people say. May I ask, which of the great philosophers of ancient and modern times could predict fate or read faces? If Socrates, Kant, Hegel, and Engels knew how to predict fate, they would be as busy as Yuan Shushan, a true genius in Shanghai, and would have no time to think and write?</p>
<p>In fact, the art of fortune telling and physiognomy is not as mysterious as most people imagine, nor is it so full of philosophical flavor. (Of course, modern philosophy has been incorporated into the field of science.) Modern European and American psychologists have found psychological basis for the principles of fortune telling and physiognomy, especially in the research of physiognomy, which makes more use of scientific methods. The German science of handwriting analysis, the American science of facial morphology, and the French science of emotional response have already raised the banner of revolution for traditional physiognomy, and the future development is unlimited.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese fortune-telling techniques could at most be said to be based on historical experience, and there were many far-fetched places that were not convincing. The emerging physiognomy that is researched based on psychological principles is completely different. The history of their development is still short, and it is certainly not possible to say that they have completely approached scientific methods, but the future trend will certainly enable physiognomy to occupy an important position in the scientific field.</p>
<p>German psychologist Dr. Lansing wrote a thick "Science of Handwriting Analysis" based on his more than 20 years of teaching experience. In 1940, Lansing determined from the handwriting of Hitler and Goebbels that they would surely die in the war. There was also a famous female star, Natalie Lehman, who published her signature style in the newspaper, and Lansing determined that this star would surely divorce once and be abandoned again, which was later proven. The research of handwriting analysis has recently spread from Germany and France to the United States, and many scholars have emerged. In recent years, scientific physiognomy has made great progress in the United Kingdom, and experts have published specialized reports on their research. This includes palm reading, toe reading, face reading, hair and skin reading, belt reading, etc. American psychologists have gathered together, and their research in this area is also booming. Now, let's just talk about the research of face reading.</p>
<p>American psychologist Hollingworth deduces various different personalities from the emotional responses of a group of people to determine their future and see what kind of work their abilities are best suited to do in order to achieve success. This is the first step in the research of scientific physiognomy. In fact, studying the different emotional responses of each person to measure their personality does not contain the meaning of determining whether fate is good or bad. Professor Bolling uses seven different tests to measure the correlation between facial morphology and emotions, temperament, success expectations, perseverance, thought, and physique, gradually approaching the questions that face reading needs to answer. According to the research of most psychologists, this kind of test is considered very reliable. He and his students have been hired by several industrial organizations and large stores in New York. When recruiting new employees, they are asked to express their opinions after observing various different facial morphologies as a reference for recruitment. Bolling also compiled a special book based on his ten years of observation and investigation experience and the records of thousands of subjects, called "Facial Morphology and Luck," pointing out the facial morphologies of some lucky people, some mediocre people, and some unlucky people. His disciple, Feller, continued to conduct scientific research on the relationship between body shape and personality, preferences, and destiny, and made many valuable discoveries. The institute of physiognomy he founded has received a lot of support from psychologists. Students from the University of Wisconsin, the University of Michigan, Cornell University, and the University of California have joined the research there. Professor Fulnell of Yale University has recently focused on the study of handprints, but his research is different from the handprint science studied by criminologists. He wants to discover the correlation between various different handprints and people's emotions, personalities, preferences, and other factors. According to him, the thickness of the handprints is quite related to a person's fate, and the thickness and hardness of the palm can be used as an important factor in measuring whether a person's future is happy or not.</p>
<p>Professor Compong, who was originally a professor of anthropology at Harvard University, has been extremely interested in the "psychological type" divided by the Institute of Psychology for several years. His thesis "Type and Intelligence" has long attracted general attention. Now, he is committed to scientific physiognomy, which is changing with each passing day, and wants to discover its connection with happiness from the "psychological type" and create a "type physiognomy" separately. He also wants to study the "blood type" valued by physicians, because if the fate of a person can be measured from the type, and then the analysis of the "blood type" can be added, perhaps more accurate results can be obtained.</p>
<p>Psychologists use various tests to understand a person's emotions, personality, interests, intelligence, etc., which is also of great help to scientific physiognomy. However, according to Guan Xin and another psychologist, the method of testing is still direct and can be used for psychological research, but it seems to take more steps to intuitively measure a person's appearance and be able to understand him and predict his future. Therefore, the scientific face reading technique that is researched and established based on psychology can only use the results of the test as a reference, but does not need to go through the testing procedure again.</p>
<p>Someone asked Feller: If physiognomy is truly established on science, then a person's future can be determined by his facial morphology, which seems to place too much emphasis on the idea of ​​"determinism." Can the changes in the environment and human efforts not transfer a person's fate?</p>
<p>Feller's answer is very correct. He said: "Fate is not absolute, but relative. What scientific physiognomy wants to study is the 'general trend,' just as psychologists study people's emotions and personality. It can let us know what a person's general psychological state is like, but it does not affirm that it is permanently fixed and will continue like this forever. At the same time, based on the psychological principles of physiognomy, it can make people more deeply recognize the meaning of 'individual differences' and 'special intelligence,' so that everyone can move in the direction where academic career may develop the most."</p>
<p>In short, the emerging scientific physiognomy established based on psychological principles is a fresh and cutting-edge discipline. We hope that more of this knowledge can be introduced to China. In today's complex society, in addition to adhering to what the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said, "You must know yourself," we should also understand others with an appropriate attitude. This is quite related to the adaptation of life between individuals.</p>
<h3>Unable to Resist a Smile</h3>
<p>— Tian Yi</p>
<p>Hungary's currency is inflated and banknotes are worthless. Therefore, the Hungarian government issued a new currency called the Florint, with each new currency being worth 40 million old pengos. In fact, I think it would be better if the Hungarian government did not issue a new currency.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you the advantage below:</p>
<p>If a businessman goes to Hungary, he will definitely talk about this when talking to them:</p>
<p>"Brother, how much money do you have in the bank?"</p>
<p>"Not much, only 100 million yuan"</p>
<p>"What? How much?"</p>
<p>"100 million yuan."</p>
<p>"Ah! Congratulations, congratulations, so may I ask how much do you make every day?"</p>
<p>At this time, the businessman wanted to smoke, so the Hungarian hurriedly took out a 1 million yuan banknote to light it, so the businessman hurriedly said:</p>
<p>"Brother, that's a 1 million yuan bill!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, it's nothing!"</p>
<h3>For the Sake of Life</h3>
<p>— Youfu</p>
<p>There's a photo studio on Tibet Road that I often visit for photos. Each time I go, I always see a boy around ten years old working very busily. I couldn't help but develop an interest in him, hoping to have a conversation and learn about his background, but I never had a good opportunity, which I always regretted.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I went there again. As soon as I arrived at the photo studio, I saw the boy again. I directly said to him, "I need my photos for application, please urge them! Are they ready?" He smiled and said, "Let me go take a look!" In a moment, he ran back and said to me, "The photos will be ready soon, please wait a moment." In less than five minutes, he brought the photos. I thanked him very much for being so efficient.</p>
<p>As these impressions were still swirling in my mind, I remembered my original thought. So I looked around, and besides a female employee, there was no one else. I thought this was a golden opportunity and immediately started chatting with him.</p>
<p>I saw him sitting on the sofa, reading a yellow magazine. I asked him, "Can you read?" He replied, "I don't know many characters." Then, I asked him a series of questions about his background, and he answered them one by one. After hearing his story, I felt very sad. It was as if he wasn't speaking, but groaning. Yes, he was groaning about the lament of a photo studio apprentice.</p>
<p>He is only sixteen years old and from Pudong. Before the war, his family had a good environment. After the war, his father died and no one could continue the business, so the store had to close. His mother is old and relies on his father's savings to survive. For eight years, they have been barely eking out a living. In 1943, he graduated from elementary school but couldn't continue his education due to economic constraints. After the victory, prices slightly dropped, then greatly rose, making it difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, he had to reluctantly leave his elderly mother and become an apprentice at the photo studio. For three meals a day, he works all day long. Regardless of strong winds, heavy snow, or scorching sun, he must obey his boss's orders and work. Every day from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he has no rest during this time. Speaking of his salary, it's truly laughable. Besides providing food, he only receives 5,000 yuan. He started with 5,000 yuan and still gets 5,000 yuan now. I really don't understand how they survive.</p>
<p>He also told me that he loves to look at paintings and read books, but he has absolutely no free time to do so. Finally, he said very pessimistically, "I am an uneducated person, so I can only be a beast of burden for the rest of my life. That's just my fate! "For the sake of life, what can one say?</p>
<p>This is a social problem. Nowadays, tens of thousands of children and young people are forced to drop out of school and live miserable lives because of the pressures of survival. I believe there are many people who are even more miserable than this apprentice!</p>
<h3>Don't Just Use Your Mouth, Use Your Eyes More Often</h3>
<p>— Lingren</p>
<p>Many years ago, in a theater in Chicago, USA, there was a speaker. During his speech, only the stage lights were on, and the lights in the audience were all off. At first, he heard a lot of noise from the audience, but after a while, the noise decreased. He thought his speech was having a good effect, so he spoke more energetically and with more animation. Half an hour passed, and the noise gradually decreased. An hour passed, and there was almost no sound from the audience. After an hour and a half, he finished his speech and the lights were turned on. Only then did he realize that the audience had all slipped away. However, miraculously, he saw one person remaining in the front row. He was surprised and asked the person why he didn't leave with the others. The person replied, "Because after you finish speaking, it's my turn."</p>

<h3>How Ruthless! Eating the Blood of Dancers and Profiteering from the Refugees</h3>
<p>— Chongzheng</p>
<p>The urgent problem that needs to be solved is rescuing the three million refugees from Northern Jiangsu. Now, various regions are responding to this great charitable relief movement. Even the dancers who lead a life of embracing for survival are generously holding charity dances for disaster relief.</p>
<p>However, some people have come up with extremely despicable ideas and used extremely ruthless means in such a solemn act of charity, eating the blood of dancers and profiteering from the refugees. Their behavior is hateful, and their hearts are deserving of punishment.</p>
<p>According to reports, a dancer named Li Zhenzhen in a certain dance hall had a customer buy her dance tickets for one million yuan, but the dance hall manager deducted 700,000 yuan from it. I feel that 700,000 yuan is a small matter, but with the lives of three million people at stake, this gentleman is too ruthless.</p>
<p>In fact, the dancers themselves are forced to smile for a living. Their income is the crystallization of their bodies and souls, and they are also exploited by the big bosses. They themselves are already miserable enough. But today, they resolutely give up a day's earnings to participate in the charity dance, donating the money earned from forcing smiles to the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Unexpectedly, this manager deducted 700,000 yuan from the one million yuan earned by a dancer. After taking advantage of this opportunity, I wonder how he can sleep peacefully at night?</p>

<h3>An Old Man's Heart (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Why have the Chinese people fallen into such a state? I can only find such an unsatisfactory answer, which is "the trend of the times, nothing can be done about it." Today, the three million refugees in Northern Jiangsu refuse to participate in the "struggle" under the call of Zhu and Mao, which is to go against the trend, to be counter-revolutionary, to be non-revolutionary. Their displacement and death in ditches, the countless innocent children who are starving and dying of disease, in the eyes of those progressive elements who have climbed to the forefront of the times, who are standing at the forefront, and washing away the "revolution," are they worthy of death? Therefore, Mr. Yuan's hunger strike telegram, Mr. Huang Yanpei's "conscience words," and Dr. Hu Shi's sympathy for the refugees in Northern Jiangsu will not receive good criticism from a group of progressive elements and revolutionaries. I predict that Mr. Yanpei will inevitably be criticized by his allies in his noble alliance! As for the heads of Mr. Yuan and Dr. Hu, including this small district, I dare to say that they have already made several hats for them, such as "corrupt, stubborn, declining, unprogressive, used by the government, unversed in the times..." etc., etc.</p>
<p>The Chinese people also have a special characteristic, which is that they only seek to satisfy their own desires, and they never care about the lives and deaths of others. At this moment, in the "barren land" of culture, such cruel facts are still prevalent, that is, when a boat capsizes and sinks, and countless drowning people are calling for help, those lucky ones who row many wooden boats and come downstream, only care about robbing things, and usually ignore them. If there are refugees who can swim and desperately climb onto their rudders, these lucky ones will still desperately beat them into the water. According to those lucky ones, "The drowning of these people is because the drowning ghosts are asking for replacements, it's all destined, they should die. If you save their lives, the drowning ghosts will replace them." Such a cruel mentality cannot be sympathized with by civilization; but cultured people also often commit the same cruel mentality, turning a blind eye to the imminent death of the three million refugees in Northern Jiangsu, ignoring them. To this day, we only hear a few words of conscience from Mr. Huang Yanpei, Dr. Hu's light sigh, and Mr. Yuan's hunger strike telegram, which is just one example.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan! You are already seventy-one years old this year! In such a terrible country as China, to live to your old age is truly a "human treasure" worth celebrating! Alas! Respectable "old man's heart!"</p>
<p>This small district has always been independent, discerning right and wrong, and seeking justice. Knowing that in this era, it is not the way to "protect oneself wisely," I cannot help but often feel reminiscent of Emperor Xian of Han's words: "I also don't know when my life will end!"</p>
<p>A Collection of Brief Comments</p>
<h3>The Full Rong Case Detective Secrets Revealed</h3>
<p>— Wulingren</p>
<p>It is reported that there was malpractice in the dance hall, and a dance hall girl named Li Zhenzhen had one million yuan in dance tickets, which was deducted by the dance hall manager for 700,000. Therefore, the Dance Hall Industry Association stated that it would thoroughly investigate. Of course, the general public is very resentful of this manager's "ruthlessness." Jin believes that the dance hall authorities are also too negligent. Why didn't they ask her to hold a grand "swearing-in" ceremony at the beginning of her employment?</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters has publicly released the entire process of solving the kidnapping case of Rong Desheng. The report is tens of thousands of words long, and many newspapers are sparing no effort to publish it, even at the expense of valuable space. This was not an easy task to accomplish in the concession era before the war. It seems that even cases more valuable than Rong Desheng's kidnapping have never had such a public and detailed report after the entire case was concluded. Was it that the foreigners deliberately buried the merits of the many Chinese officers who contributed, or did they look down on the press? Or did they think that it was inappropriate to publicly divulge the secrets of detective skills, so as not to increase the difficulty of solving the next case?</p>
<p>British Miss Samoskir wants to lick her fingers after eating chocolate, according to her, the only reason is that it is currently rare to taste this flavor. From the perspective of Shanghai ladies, they only feel that Miss Sa is too shabby and "poor." Isn't it true that Shanghai has plenty of foreign candies that can be bought along the way and are very cheap, so even the beggar Li Zhongsheng eats a tea-gray empty stomach?</p>
<p>The authorities are said to have raised the housing rent standard, calculated as 1,000 times the rent in 1937. At the same time, there is also the saying that rents will be allowed to increase. Residential houses will increase by 500 times the amount in 1937, and commercial houses will increase by 1,000 times. Many people who already have residences are clamoring that they "can't afford it," but there are also many people who think they "can afford it" but have no place to live.</p>
