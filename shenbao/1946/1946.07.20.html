<p>〔本市訊〕差不多第一個記者都有這麼一個經騐：「在朝的要人要比在野的難見得多」。假使每一位要人都是難見的話，那麼中委潘公展先生該是例外。</p>
<p>十九日上午他穿了一件白綢長衫在私寓接見了記者，花白的短髪下是一副慈祥而和悅的面孔，使記者忘了他是一個要人。他從善如流地對記者發表了一些對政治和經濟等問題的意見，他將中國政治的僵持，比作一個盲腸炎患者，亟須找良醫診治，而且已潰爛的必須割掉，才能使生命不致墮入險境，他以為翻開中國的廿四史看只有平內亂。所謂內戰，美國之南北戰爭方可稱之，在蘇北之共軍，雖已答應撤退原駐該地之軍隊，而政權不能交出，則政府之軍政「如何能統一」。國內的和平統一，不能實現，完全是因為共產黨沒有談判的誠意</p>
<p>關於黃炎培先生致共黨毛澤東先生的一封信，潘先生認為黃行銷生為什麼不將該信公開發表。蘇北的難民如此之多，黃先生為什麼沒有蘇北之行，潘先生唏噓地說，「延安歸來」一書，不知害了多少人。民盟的中執委李公樸，聞一多二氏，昆明遇害的眞相未透　之前，記者們不可即作為是政治性暗殺的報導，政府對此　　事件必須澈查。</p>

<h3 id="c29">不可解的兩件事 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>大槪天氣熱了，人們心理上都有些煩躁，加以國內外許多事情，往往出人意外，所以這幾天來報載的新聞，每有使常人不可解者。姑舉兩事，證實吾說。但我們還是希望大家心平氣和，恢復理智，切莫讓感情衝動，心思旁驚，更加弄糟了國家事。</p>
<p>第一，我們最奇怪的是周恩來氏前天在滬招待記者的談話，竟公然指稱陳立夫氏來滬的任務是「加強特務，佈置新的政治暗殺」，甚至誣稱「黑單之上，民主人士之名字已多，彼等性命早在陳氏之手，故昆明事件隨時可在京滬等地發生。」這種恙黨領袖之口，不僅是失態，簡直是觸犯刑章。在大庭廣眾中，向中外記者六七十人公然如此宣布，對怪陳氏要函質周氏，要其負侮辱誹謗的法律責任。不過為什麼周氏感情衝動到如此？想來想去，殊不可解。有些人以為，從中共最近的秘密文件中，可以看出各地正在佈置製造慘案的陰謀，周氏說這番話，是否他們自己想動手，犧牲幾個已經利用過的「民主人士」，再作為攻計政府的藉口，這種想法，按照中共所持「人人是工具，事事是過程」的敎條，以及中共已往自己要打先喊人家要打的作風，加以推斷，也許是可能的事情。但憑人性來測度，我們還是不願相信而且不敢相信。因為中共如果眞這樣做，大家祇供給他們做工具，還有誰願和他們誠信相孚的做朋友？所以我們聽了周恩來感情激越的談話，終究不了解他的眞意所在。</p>
<p>第二，我們也很奇怪的是「聯總」署長賴伽第亞停運來華物資的輕舉妄動。聯總是各國所共同組織，中國是參加的主要國家，中國抗戰八年，有待救濟至切，誰都知道。聯總為什麼輕信中國分署若干人的不實報告，就有這樣魯莽舉措？尤其好笑的，連呈訴的二百二十五人的姓名，職位，國籍，賴氏自己都還沒有弄明白，就突然憑他個人的主觀來發這意外的命令！最近我們聽見負責任的高級長官說過，聯總以往供給許多中國人不需要的物資，甚至「假貨」「壞貨」都夾在裏面，我們不解聯總為什麼不先自己來一個澈底淸查？而且，聯總一船一船運來的物資，事前並不徵詢中國意見，也不通知中國政府，等到船靠埠了，還拿不出一張貨單來，天下竟有這樣的救濟機關，這那裏可以責怪人家配運得慢？至於「聯總」分署在中國一批一批來了這許多外國朋友，是否必需，姑且不說，而他們來了，先要弄好起居飮食，然後參加中國的政治作用，與中共裏應外合，破壞中國行政系統的統一，這又豈是救濟的本意？我們想來想去，想不出「聯總」這批外國朋友為什麼要如此做法？賴伽第亞說，他不喜歡那一個外國人，却為宋院長聘戀情了。難道他為了這點意氣，就可和一次受救濟的中國人民為難嗎？更不可解的，在中國的「聯總」過去這樣腐敗，「聯總」這樣侮辱中國，「聯總分署」這一部份外國人這樣妄報，而我們「行總」署長事前豈竟毫無知悉？如果知道，為什麼不向政府和社會報告？為什麼不事前向各國解釋眞相？事後在遠東區委員會會議裏，他又為什麼不據理力爭，反而贊同他國代表的意見，以為賴伽第亞的政策並不完全錯誤？也有人說，這些時蔣署長心無二用，更有要事待理，怪不得他，果爾，我們又有什麼話可說！</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕斯達林已在高級軍官中，實行肅軍工作，將蘇聯之第一號戰時英雄巨哥夫將軍貶　為地方司令官。關於改繃一事，雖未曾有官方公報發表，據悉此種改組工作業已着手進行。迄今所知者主要犧牲人物為巨哥夫，渠曾於三月前調任蘇聯地上軍司令，並昇列為最高蘇維埃主席團之一員，現則調任奧特薩區司令。據聞巨哥夫並非為此次改組中之唯一犧牲者，惟關於其他更動，則尚未獲悉，據聞實質上此次肅軍運動，已在進行中，惟不若一九三七年肅淸運動之嚴重，當時紅軍高級軍官均予以革職，並控以與托洛斯基及其他政敵合作之罪名，處以極刑。巨哥夫似非因政見不同致被貶官，諒係因有對國家不忠之嫌疑，當渠任柏林同盟國管制委員會蘇代表時，已為艾森臺威爾之友人。蘇聯地上軍司公之繼任人選，尚未發表渠，仍為蘇共黨最高機關政治局之一員。按奧特薩軍司令區，管轄南俄及巴爾幹國境地帶，戰前奧特薩為西俄一重要軍區。紅軍機關報「紅星報」最近曾發起整肅紅軍紀律大宣傳運動，尤注重蘇聯之安全。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕歐洲「鐵幕」能否予以揭開，或將更加深厚，數日內可見分曉，消息靈通人士頃談稱，英政府正在倫敦與蘇聯進行談話，同時又與美國在柏林進行談判，冀有以改善現行局勢。英國現有兩種途徑可循，一即努力與蘇聯樹立較為密切之關係，一即與蘇聯對立，而將德國裂而為二，從而將歐洲乃至全世界裂而為二。關於此事，英商務大臣克里浦斯現在倫敦與蘇代表克闌索夫進行談判，準備成立商業協定，以之作為澄淸雙方一般關係之基礎。此外，英代表又在柏林與美方進行談話，冀在英美爾軍佔領區為德國經濟統一進行籌備工作，此種工作茍非蘇聯完全贊同，即將不顧蘇聯之異議而付諸實施，以上兩項談話，風吹日曬在秘密中進行，但據可靠消息，自去歲以來，英蘇兩國商務關係，已因蘇聯方面拒不准許，英貨物輸入而告中斷，此項貨物約值一千一百萬鎊，業已準備付運，迄至本年四月底，英國廠商約一百四十人名括汽車業紡織業在內，又向英商務部與供應部建議，擬與蘇聯恢復商業，幷以五千萬鎊信用貸款界予蘇聯，而以十年為期，倫敦方面現所進行之談話，即以此項建議為基礎，但蘇聯方面認為各項貨物價值太昻，未允接受，好在蘇聯已將大批金條運入英國，此可成為十年信用貸款之保證，亦未可必。至以英美兩國專家在柏林所進行之談話而論，且標所在乃將德東西兩部隔離，其要點為（一）英美應充分利用其佔領區內所有資產，不得自蘇聯輸入貨物；（二）英美兩國小組委會應為各該國佔領區擬定計劃，用以鼓勵生產確定物價；（三）英美兩國如不能與蘇聯成立協議，即當互相商定物價水準，幷以馬克為交換之工具；（四）談話進行至最後階段時，當請法國參加。至此消息靈通人士作一總結云，倫敦方面現所進行之談話相當樂觀，似欲成立一種合理的協定。柏林方面所進行之談話，則可使西歐與東歐互相離異。其性質逈不相同。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：今日比基尼島舉行原子彈演習時，所用之假彈鎂光彈於預定時刻前五十一分，突然爆炸。雖因爆炸過早及天氣惡劣，迫使多數飛機返基地，但另一顆假彈於規定時間爆炸，演習並未受阻。據白朗第稱：爆發過早之原因不詳。據參謀部人員之解釋，因電道路綫發生錯誤，突然於八時十四分爆炸。白朗第謂爆發過早，與眞實原子彈試騐無甚關係，因發動炸彈之電路防範未臻周密之故。並謂舉行眞實原子彈水面以下爆炸時，對於爆發時刻保證其正確。當鎂光彈爆發時，上空發生劇烈激動，參加演習之飛機四十七架被迫退回，祇留九架觀測氣候。</p>

<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹淸　（績完）</p>
<p>較林肯前一任的郵政局長赫爾，他是從新澤西州來的；卸任郵政局後，自己蓋了一幢『兩層樓』的木板小屋，而且設立了一個小商店，販賣各咱雜貨。據說：赫爾當年在紐塞冷村中，是相當「大享」的人物。林肯卸任郵政局長後，也走赫爾的路，開一個「林肯雜貨店」，林肯雜貨店在一顆大槐樹下，是全村十幾幢陋屋中最後建造的一幢。門前是泥路，大槪下雨天泥濘路滑，林肯舖了幾塊零露落的石塊，但是石塊大光，我担心林肯當年，一定在下雨天　交。</p>
<p>林肯雜貨店中有各種簡單的，美國一百年以前的日用品，還有林肯自己做的木器。雜貨店對面，是林肯的家。林肯於一八四二年在村中結婚，而且育了子嗣，這在林肯的書札中可以見及。林肯的子女中，有一個是夭死在那個村子中的。在林肯的所謂「家」裏，有「自鳴鍾」，有廚房，有極簡單的冬天生火的壁爐。也有好幾架雙層的床，這些床是村中每家都有的。導遊的說：雙架床上面睡父母，下層睡嬰孩。村子中有兩家醫生，醫生的家比較稍稍「闊綽」。後來林肯當選總統以後，醫生也就搬離了這座村子。美國是一個太年輕的國家，但年輕國普爾人民，也一樣「懷古」，他們的懷古勁是可佩的，他們要保線一樣特件的「逼眞」，這是在其他國家所少見的。全村之中祇有一幢房子是近代式的，那是林肯紀念博士館。博物館中陳列林肯送致家鄭父老的書信，那是林肯當選大總統以後，從白宮寫來的。信內說上許多懷念那座小村的話，另外還有謀剌林肯總統的兇手的利器，有叛徒後來企圖盜竊林肯屍體用的挖土刀鏟同，釘錘也陳列有林肯結婚時所用的鋼琴，以及林肯親筆加批的圖書。林肯在紐塞冷村住了六年以後，便搬到春田城裏去了，那是林肯結婚後的事，春田城裏有所謂林肯的家，那是我要說的第二件可看之處。那是一幢現代化的西式小屋，距離現在伊利諾亞的州議會不遠，現在也由州政府管理作為公園，四週聞有白牆。林肯的小屋，在一個轉灣角上，兩邊都臨馬路。小屋兩層，後面另有一塊極小的花園，屋是白色的，窗檻是綠色的，內部一共五間，樓上不准參觀，樓下有政府的管理員，參觀翥和須寫明姓名履歷，然後入內。第一間是客室，有一夲年前的沙發設略去。管理員說：那是林肯夫人的坐起室。雖然老舊，但較之紐塞冷村的農家陋屋，已不可同日而語了。林肯的書室中有美孚牌煤油燈，有油畫和花瓶，有舊式的璧爐，有兒童坐椅，還有林肯曾經用過的用絹。這座屋子林肯曾經住過十七年，（一八四四—一八六一），故稱之為「林肯的家。一屋子的大門上，有兩塊銅牌，一塊寫：「林肯的家」；一塊寫維希·林得賽的一首詩，描寫林肯當年瘦長的身軀，如何出入於此一屋子，描寫一大羣兒童在門前遊要。這首詩在美國是非常有名的，摘錄自林得賽的詩葉：「林肯的半夜工作。」伊利諾亞政府在紐　准村及城內的「林肯的家」，都有保存古貴的堂皇佈告，並挿有大幅的美國國旗，國旗上面的　的數目是不同的，代表當年美國有多少州。看過林肯之家以後，好像已經回到一八六一年以後。林肯當選了總統，為解放黑奴，南北戰事爆發了。打了四年，林肯功成　死，林肯於一八六五年被叛黨刺死，運回春田城安葬，林肯的肉體死了，但林肯的精神却永生了！沒有人不感嘆林肯的偉大，特別是當你憑吊了林肯的墓地以後。墓的建築非常簡雅而莊嚴，全部都是花崗石造成了，墓穴在花崗石下面。參觀者簽名後可以進入，墓穴的牆上有林肯的書續，文告，以及最著名的一八六三年十一月十九日葛茨堡演講。墓穴的正中，是林肯的棺　，上面寫「如今他屬於上蒼。」墓穴前面石壁上，刻有林肯家必的姓名，及各人的生死年代。墓園在春田城郊附近，遠　便可以看見大塊草坪，綠蔭，以及高聲著的花崗石墓塔。墓塔四週刋有四十八州的州名，四角裝有銅像，都是南北戰爭時代的士兵裝京；步兵　砲兵等等殉難的無名將士，這些人等等殉難的無名將士，這些人是追隨着林肯總統，替美國奠立國家基礎的一批英雄。林肯總統的大銅像　立在墓前，每天有許多美國的男男女女，他們來自東南西北，瞻仰他們歷史上最偉大的一代的完人林肯總墓園也是公墓園。四週盡是填墓，那是美國死了的老百姓。林肯給美國人的印象是深刻的，沒有林肯，美國的統一不會奠立得那麼完整；沒有傈肯，美國的工業化也許會延遲幾十年。南北戰爭不是林肯的目的，林肯給美國的貢獻是強須力的統一，和加速度的工業化，這兩件法寶，正是美國以後用來打敗西班牙，兩次打敗德國，一次打敗了日本的重要素。林肯替今日美國的世界領袖地位，奠立了不拔的基礎，誰說林肯總統業已死去。林肯正永生着啊！（寄自伊利諾亞州傑克遜維爾）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南京國民參政會駐會委員會，昨晨舉行常會時，駐會委員吳貽芳女士（金陵女子大學校長）提出檢舉現任上海市政府秘書長何德奎有漢奸嫌疑，並謂有照片爲證等情，本市各界聞訊，無不驚異。昨午五時，即有各報記者赴市政府分訪何秘書長德奎，時何氏正自善後救濟總署之審議會歸來，當即招待記者等於市府會議室，何氏衣白夏布長衫，執黑紙扇，態度極爲從容，笑語記者稱：對於此意外消息之傳來，本人願發表三點事實：（一）民國三十年十二月八日珍珠港事件發生後，上海公共租界工部局英美籍之總董，董事·總辦·財務處長以及大小職員，根據美當局之意旨，全體繼續於工部局服務，故本人自亦當繼續服務。（二）本人在工部局與英美人共同服務，日敵對留任英美人及德奎等從未加委，因爲工部局乃國際性之機構。（三）後來南京傀儡組辦要接收上海公共租界工部局之風聲傳來，本人立即提出辭職，故當奸逆陳公博來接收時，本人亦已早溜。當時敵僞雖盡力拉攏，但本人一概予以拒絕，故出處光明磊落。又欲附帶聲明者，本人素來無黨無派，在上海公共租界工部局時代，民國廿一年六月一日受上海公共租界工部局華董之推薦，擔任會辦，歷六載後，升爲副總辦，爲時亦近六載。於淪陷時期，僅任華商實業界如銀行紗廠等顧問名義，籍取生活費，以維持生活。光復後，即任三民主義靑年團聯合各界招待盟邦集中營僑民委員會主任委員，又任上海市房地產處理委員會委員，房屋租賃管理委員會副主任委員，上海市政府副市長，後因副市長制度取消，故改稱秘書長。迄今十餘年來，奉公守法，廉潔自持，絕無虛心之處，然偶而不免有因公而開罪於人，則全屬爲公，毫　私見。</p>
<p>何氏旋即以方型週刋「吉普」所鬧之笑話相吿，謂數月前，「吉普」刋物中，登載「何副市長力保丁濟萬」消息一則，一時謠言紛起，甚至有人向蔣主席，行政院及監察院吿發，事實上無絲毫根據，而該刋物於肇事後，立即於次期刋載更正之消息，無稽謠言，亦不攻自破矣·故對於昨日被檢舉漢奸嫌疑之消息，表示並不十分嚴重僅謂可證諸事實。</p>
<p>何氏又稱：渠與吳貽芳素不相熟，「八一三」之前，曾一度於船上相遇，對彼印象極爲良好，且相信吳貽芳對本人亦不致有惡感，此次之檢舉，恐係受人鼓動。對於報載有照片作證，則完全不得而知，亦無法懸揣。淪陷期間，與中央一直保持連絡，所做之愛國工作，現任交通部上海電信局長郁秉堅知之甚詳　且十餘年來，始終未曾離滬，一舉一動，在滬中外人士，類多知之，毋待累述也。</p>
<p>按何氏係浙江金華人，前在北京大學肄業，名列前茅，民國六年經教育部考取第一名派赴美國留學，一九一九年得威斯康星大學學士，一九二一年得哈佛大學工商管理科碩士，回國後，曾任上海大同大學南洋大學教授，光華大學商科主任，審查公共租界工部局經濟委員會及上海租界納稅華人會英文秘書等職，研究上海公共租界市政歷有年所，故由工部局董事會議決，一致贊同聘爲會辦。何氏之涉足實業界，爲淪陷後開始，其中一度曾輔導新聞報館辦理淸寒貸學金，嗣聞漢奸陳日平將加入新聞報，乃即辭職。</p>
<h3 id="c50">張知本談調查接收工作　歡迎人民密告但須列舉事實　違法凟職者決秉公處斷 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區接收工作調查　團長張知本氏，十八日晨由京抵滬，昨在私邸接見中央社記者秀稱：本團係由中央監察委員會，監察院，國民參政會三機關組成，爲便利調查工作起見，現分滬杭，南京，安微三組，京滬組由本人及程中行，范爭波，吳望伋及秘書徐隆川五人負責，程范二人均在滬，吳徐日內亦來此，即可開始工作，本團辦公地點，決定暫假江蘇監察使署，工作期定爲五十天，上海接收工作自去年八月開始，迄今瞬已一年，欲在五十天中淸查一年之接收工作，時間至感迫促，加以上海區敵僞產業接收工作最繁，情形亦較複雜，故不得不採取最經濟最有效之步驟，積極辦理，希望本市黨政機關民衆團體及新聞界與本團取得聯繫協助調查，提供具體材料，以供本團參考。同時本團希望不僅有「收音機」且需要「播音機」，以便在淸查工作開始後，隨時將材料公諸國人，此點實有賴於新聞界同人多予協助。記者叩詢張氏是否接受人民「密吿」，渠稱：「密吿」自然甚好，但需要「密吿人」能有負責精神，據聞過去本市設置密吿箱，所接收之「密告」函件中，竟有具名「東南西北人」「國民一份子」之事，且密吿內容，常攻擊個人，不能提供正確證據，未免失去「密吿」意義，今後如有列舉事實，負責具名之密吿函件，本團至表歡迎。</p>
<p>談及上海敵僞產業過去接收情形，張氏稱，余確曾聽到若干傳聞，所謂「接收物資」「失却人心」之事，不乏指摘，且聞倉庫中竟有若干可食可用之物資，坐視糜爛，不加處理，祗知「接收物資」，不知「利用物資」，凡此均爲責任上之過失表現，本團自當澈底查究，如有假借職權違法凟職，或疏忽處理之情形，祗需有正確證明，本團無不秉公處斷，彷彿法官判案一般，如原吿有證件提出，法官即可根據條文，審訊判決，自無困難。</p>
<p>對於如何肅淸貪汚一點，張氏稱：貪汚自爲不良現象，但一方面大聲疾呼「公務員不能生活」，一方面又說「公務員貪汚」，未免矛盾，余以爲貪汚者究屬少數，不能將此種「穢名」，普遍冠於公務員頭上，使潔身自愛者亦有黑白難分之感，乃致造成「好人不做公務員」，「做公務員必貪汚」之籠統心理，須知眞正貪污凟職之輩，國家自有法律制裁，祇需提出證據，政府無不立時懲辦，而不應籠統指摘，徒使友邦人士見疑，此種觀念，吾人必須切實科正，至於公務員待遇之改善，自亦爲當前應急之要務云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局自十八日開始第二次擴大防疫運動後，據統計現已經注射者已超過一百五十三萬人，防疫委員會鑒於浦東區患霍亂者頗多，救濟困難，現在東昌路市立第三醫院收容醫治，有病床卅只。又徐家滙方面，由廠家商店自動捐助物質，設徐滙臨時時疫醫院一所，有病床廿五只，完全免費。防疫委員會爲推進環境衛生，希望直接减少疫病，定有淸潔區制，分期淸除宿積垃圾，利用蘇北難民一百五十人，及漕河涇游民習藝所三百餘人，於昨日黎明前三時集合，會同原有淸道夫分隊出發，並訂定市民淸潔公約，請各區各保勸導市民一體注意。</p>
<p>昨日息霍亂者六十一人，死三人，連前共計二，三六一人，死一七〇人。</p>
<p>上海時疫醫院　播音籌募經費</p>
<p>際此時疫猖獗，上海時疫醫院因上次所經募之二千萬元，業已用罄，特由該院董事劉鴻生，朱子奎等，發起播音募捐籌備委員會，并假湖社招待記者，到有該院董事王曉籟，鄧靑山，竇耀庭，黃振世，王允康，包小蝶，唐寳琪，委員龔兆熊，盧繼影，徐警庸，周一星，嚴孝方，陸錦榮等。據竇耀庭語記者：該院　辦迄令二九載，歷史悠久，素以服務社會，救濟貧病爲職旨，每年夏秋時疫流行期間，停診普通病症，專治霍亂痢疾時疫諸症，不分晝夜，無論貧富，一律施診給藥·貧病須住院醫療者，所需醫藥針膳等，亦概不收費，並擴充免費病床，儘量收容，以利貧病。除特等頭等二等病房收費外，三等病床一百只及門診醫藥，完全免費。現在藥費成本大，一切費用每天須三百萬元，爲籌募經費，以資救濟，特自本月廿五廿六兩日假座建成電臺（呼號XGSH週率八四〇）於上午十時至下午十二時，請名票者伶播唱平劇，又廿七日假座民聲電臺（呼號XPOC週率一〇四〇），廿八日假座建設電台（呼號XACS）週率九四〇）上午十時至下午十二時，播送滑稽申曲越劇。希望各界人士屆時多多慷慨解囊，爲病人造福，將來匪特時疫得以戢止，且社會可免蔓延危險。送請上海市商會理監事聯席會議，討論通過，轉呈中常會，國民政府最高國防會議，行政院，立法院暨財經兩部分別採納實施。</p>
<p>急則治標　不務高遠</p>
<p>據召集人駱淸華氏表示，六人小組，係歸納各方意見，以當前經濟危機爲中心，本急則台票之原則，立論務切實際，不務高遠，至於基本經濟大計，則</p>
<p>國父遺教三民主義的經濟政策，實爲近世紀最崇高最進步之指針，蔣主席「中國之命運」一書中，更有極詳盡之啓示。聞最高國防會議與中央設計局，亦早經制定中國工業化五年計劃等各種具體方案，計劃已極美備，只須俟政府主管部門切實遵照執行，毋待贅論。此次本會研擬急救方案，進行殊爲審愼。同人等均深切瞭解政府目前困難實情，不敢苛求與奢望，故方案內容，卑之無甚高論，凡所指陳，皆爲政府力所能行而責無旁貸者。僉認爲先決問題，希望政府現行財政政策，必須重加體認，而於整個經濟政策與金融措施，則必須以最大之決心，亟起作澈底之革新，而農工商各界，必須一致擁護政策，勉渡難關，重建經濟基礎</p>
<p>最後關頭　一致奮起</p>
<p>目前誠爲最嚴重之時期，但亦尙不失爲最後一個機會，希望政府與人民，一致奮起，緊　此最後機會，勿青瞻顧「拖」延，否則機會稍縱即逝，一旦經濟總崩潰，國家民族均成萬刦不復，覆巢之下，無一人能獲倖免云云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美方贈我的八艘軍艦，載運在美受訓的中國海軍官兵數百人，於昨日晨光曦微中駛抵吳淞口。記者等於黎明時趕到吳淞口砲臺灣海岸巡防處，與郭處長，唐參謀邱營長等乘小型汽艇至吳淞口外，歡迎學成榮歸的中國海軍官兵及友邦贈我的新式軍艦。（新護航驅逐艦二艘，佈雷及掃雷艦四艘。防潛艦二艘）記者等分乘兩艇。掠過蒼蒼海天·駛向八艦周圍巡迥參觀。艦上靑年揮手歡呼，並放燈號與歡迎者致意。彼等遙望別近九載的上海。無限歡欣，旋駐滬海軍官員登太康艦，記者等跟隨而上，但即被拒絕參觀，據謂此係此間海軍辦事處之命令。記者等請求稍加逗留作外表之參觀，亦遭嚴拒，只得遵命下艦。</p>
<p>艦上士兵·爭閱滬報</p>
<p>此時艦上回國兵員仍表示其依衣熱情，爭閱記者等所携帶登艦之報紙。渠等謂「許久已不看祖國報紙」。游泳名將徐亨現任永寗艦艦長，昨日曾下艦與記者談話。徐君神采依然，對重建祖國新海軍極感興趣。渠極盼望國內報界多多促使國人對海軍的認識及興趣。據吿記者稱：。「我們在馬爾　訓練後，本來準備即行參加抗戰，因戰爭結束較預期更早，以致失去機會。不過此次歸來，曾在東京灣及太平洋掃了一雷，聊答心願。我們於去年八月離美後，曾到古巴美國軍港（關托拿麼）試航並演習，常時一起演習的有著名的米蘇里艦和羅斯福艦。在那里共計逗留了三個月。直到去去年十月六日又到美國西岸聖比亞哥訪問華僑，他們的熱情眞令我們慚愧！後來又到占巴及墨西哥京城訪問當地情形，曾受他們當局的檢閱。接着再到美國西岸修艦，然後轉赴珍珠港加裝給養，經檀香山，中途島等地駛赴日本，在橫須賀躭擱了三天，就回到上海」。</p>
<p>八艦在吳淞口外列成一條直綫，記者等參觀時，該艦等徐徐前這，輕風微浪，一望無際。　　　林運中校亦於艦上接受記者之攝影。據悉：林氏定今晨四時率領該艦隊駛赴南京。廿四日左右再返上海。</p>
<p>裝載給養·菜單豐盛</p>
<p>八艦此次過滬，係傅遵命令並裝載給養。記者間得該項給養之統計數字如下：牛肉三千斤，猪肉三千斤，白米五千斤，蛋五百五十個，香焦三千斤，桔子五千隻，檸檬三千個，西瓜三千斤，捲心菜五千斤，洋葱二千，蕃茄二千斤，洋山芋五千斤，豆五千斤，魚四百條，葱　千斤，黃瓜三千斤。此項給養　備爲留京時之用。據謂　在美受訓時期，一切給養與美軍無異，至生活津貼，則士兵每人每月約三十元至六十元美金　今後待遇尙未完全決定。</p>

<p>市財政局以筵席館商代徵稅款，時有隱匿偸漏，經緝獲賬册者，則按漏稅總額補徵，惟往往僅能緝獲一部份發票，核之各賬册，則又漏不登載，顯係逃避稅款，若僅憑查獲之漏稅發票，數目甚小，縱予議處，不足以禁刁頑。昨經市政會議決定，即以查獲偷漏發票之日數，按日補稅議罰，幷依照最大一個月之平均營業額爲計算處罰襟準，庶足以整飭筵席稅收。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地方法院昨日審理第一件中英國際民事訴訟案，該案原吿爲中元輪船公司，被吿爲英商馬勒行（即賚賜洋行），緣去年十一月二十八日中元輪船公司向英商馬勒洋行購買「威尼弗雷馬勒」輪船一艘，訂明該輪到達上海時交貨，全部價金七萬五千英鎊，不料分期付款後，原告忽於本年三月八日　接被告方面通知，要求解約，並將定銀五萬二千英鎊及利息二十五鎊五先令六便士退還。中元公司乃根據民法第二六〇條，要求被吿賠償不履行契約所受之損失，計法幣七億七千四百七十九萬九千九百四十四元及英金一萬三千零八十八鎊。被告方面對此　稱：「威尼弗雷馬勒」輪船之出賣人原爲英國馬勒有限公司，地址在倫敦·惟原吿從被吿來函之信件上，證明倫敦與上海之馬勒洋行原爲一家。且契約上言明第二次付款時，即需交貨，今被吿雖收第二次款，不但不將輪船交出，反退還貨款，可知存心毀約。被告答稱：因英國戰時運輸局對各項交通器具下有禁止移轉令，輪船不準出售，關於此點，被告實出於不得已，且已有函致原告聲明，故請駁圓原訴。準原高堅決以爲契約上載明有第二次付款時即係交貨之期，故該船之主權無異已屬於原告，被告今旣毀約，當然請求賠償損失。至此庭諭辯論終結，定二十四日上午宣判。如被告敗訴，再定期審理賠償金之數目。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市商會以據本市造紙工業同業公會提議，擬請政府變更接收敵偽產　處理原則，特於日前以代電一件，寄送行政院，全文如下：南京行政院鈞鑒，廠會於六廿三日，召集第九屆會員大會，據本市造紙工業同業公會提議，擬請政府變更接收敵偽產業處理原則案，其理由內開，查收復區各工廠被敵偽強力佔奪，淪陷八年，廠房機械，被其佔用，原料成品，遭其劫奪，（中略）</p>
<p>損失太重無從生產</p>
<p>各廠接收以後，欲國恢復生產，正須煞費經營，以劫後餘生，百孔千瘡之局，在政府為謀經濟復興促進生產計，應如何加以維助獎掖，以達建國目的，乃聞經濟部及敵偽產業處理局處理應發還之民營工廠，祇以工廠未被損壞之機器設備為限，其所接收之原存廠內之原料成品材料等品，均須收歸國有，甚至被敵人將原有設備折毀改造之廠房設備，亦須作為敵人增設新設，責令原主作價承受。</p>
<p>名為發還僅存軀殻</p>
<p>似比情形，民營工廠名為發還，實則祇存軀殻，非從新添置原料材料，無從實施開工，以維持其生產，（中略）就事理而論，廠基與機器設備，為生產之母，敵人因佔領民營工廠，乃有添置之原料，製成之商品，及改造之設備，皆屬子母相生，不可分割，換言之，有民營工廠被佔之因，乃有上述產生之果，自應廳於被佔領之原廠主所享有，不得視為國家之戰利品，其中且有被佔時存廠原料成品等物資，一併被敵刧奪之廠，如照現議辦法辦理，損失則歸人民自負其責，名為將來可向日本秦賠，而實則產遙無期，等於望梅止渴，利益則歸國家享受，且從人民損失中分割其一部，以為國家獨享之利，揆諸國家與人民原屬一體，憂樂與共之旨，未免南轅北轍。擬請大會建議政府，將接收敵偽產業處理原則，予以變更。</p>
<p>正當辦法　建議施行</p>
<p>凡接收被佔民營工廠之原料材料成品，及增設成改造之設備，應全部發交原廠估定價值，移作該廠被敵佔奪破壞之損失，如有餘存，方可作為國有，收款入庫，但亦應酌給期限，分期拔還，以利復與而利生產，（中略）等語，查此案前曾轉請國民參政會提議，經鈞院函　參政會秘書處，以此事據收復區全國性事業接收委員會核議，有如照市商會原代電所稱，不獨各處理局已處理之被佔工廠，均須重行淸算，即於將來對日淸算索償工作，亦不免共割裂支離。是否准如所請，抑或於辦理對日賠償時，酌予各該被佔工廠以優先請求及給償之權，呈請核示等語，經鈞院依據該議各節駁復，由參政會秘書處轉函知照在案。是接收委員會議復各節，祇從公家手續上之困難立論，而於對原代電所謂「有民營工廠被佔之因，乃有上述產生之果，自應歸於被佔領之原廠主所享有，不得視為國家之戰利品。」以及「民營工廠名為發還，實則祇存軀殻」，「如照現議辦法，損失則歸人民自負其責」。</p>
<p>向日索償　遙遙無期</p>
<p>名為將來可向日本索賠，而實則遙遙無期」。各節，該會核議之理字第四四五號呈中同，均未一為計及。祇知從公家利益上打算，實非國家應以人民為本位之立場所應有，理合依據工業界之公意，重行請求，仰祈鈞院鑒核俯准施行。（下略）</p>

<p>翻開中國地力來，在東南的邊緣有一塊像桃子形的地方，地的面積小過於任何一方土地，這就是浙江省。浙江省的全面積計為一億五千三百九十六萬八千四百二十四市畝。雖然面積不算大，但她擁有二千一百七十六萬二千二百四十八個人民。平均每個人民有七，七市畝的土地。誠如沈鴻烈氏說：「浙江是個健康的人，人民知識水准相當高，生活也相當的好。」是的，浙江土地盟腴，農產品富足，加之因為鄰掃大海的地理因素所以人才輩出。</p>
<p>溫暖之鄕：浙江</p>
<p>一個健全的省，她人口統計的男女數字一定相差不很大，浙江男有一千一百七十五萬八千一百九十四人，女的有一千萬〇四千〇五十四人，其問僅相左一百多萬人，其比例的數字不太遠。因着男女比例數字的不太遠，所以始張維緊着一種古樸的風尚，很少輕佻的女子，也很少浮薄的男人。而且全境皆為可以耕種的圭地，其農地有三千七百九十萬六千〇九十七市畝，其山地有一億〇九百十二萬九千主百〇四市畝。並無濯濯的童山，都是森林茂木，可資生產的山林。祇要能一舉手之勞，便能得着溫飽的。境內交通又很發達，計道路有三十萬一千七百九十一市畝，河道湖流有三百五十七萬八千六百五十三市畝，我通工具，陸地火車汽車之外，另有各種以人力推動的車輛，水路輪船汽划子之外，另有各種不同的大小船隻，所以很多人從遠道來到浙江，很留連於這豐衣足食的溫暖之鄕。</p>
<p>墮入了苦痛深淵</p>
<p>八九年來，戰爭的烽火也燃遍了整個的浙江省，三十年淪陷子十個縣，克復了九個縣，三十一年又淪陷了二十二個縣，克復了十五個縣，三十二年淪陷了三十九個縣，拼了血肉頭顱，收復了二十九個縣，這樣地淪陷與收復，使整個生產停滯，人民逃離了原來的崗位，又加敵偽時的層層剝削，使一個錦繍的浙江，變成千孔百創破爛不堪了。巴巴地望到勝利來臨，掃收的人們「自私」與「疏忽」，使浙江再度墜入了苦能的深淵。浙江的老百姓們，他們　是夢寐以求好官的治理比什麼都迫切着了。是的今日的浙江，各縣縣城里儘多着殘牆頹壁，鄕村間，儘多着荒蕪的田地，人民不能生活，挺而走險的也比比皆是。</p>
<p>劃時代重要會議</p>
<p>浙不處主席學鴻烈氏，在下車伊始，就去視察海塘，督促搶修，接着就巡視各縣，以求民隱，當回來後，又說明復員的重要，他揭示本年着重要治安，其次救濟，再次為交通，明年要做到各縣切實負起管衛的責任，鄕鎭則做到敎養的目標，並且廣泛的舉力水利貸款。同時他認為今天造成天災的原因，是由於森林漸被砍伐之所致，所以他又擬偏重農男生產於浙西平原方面，偏重造林生產於浙東山地方面，將疏溶各條河道江流，免今後災荒之重演。他又不主空談，力求實際，今年將就一般現實的善良情形，使他量固起來，再求發展，不在立即有好看的數字與報告，而解霸實際的內容。沈鴻烈氏的確在做，而且毫不懈怠的做。我曾訪晤卓著中正的浙省臨時參議會議長朱獻文老先生，他告訴我：「像沈主席這樣，可算是勤政愛民了」。我們歡迎一位勤政愛民的好官，相反的，我們反對一個「疏忽」「自私」的污吏。我們願意看沈氏積極的乾下去。本月二十日，沈氏又召開全省行政會議於杭垣，這也可以主是浙江省政治上劃時代的一個重要會議，往者已矣，我們願勉勵來者！</p>
<p>治安·吏治·救濟</p>
<p>依據沈主席的揭示：浙省本年處重治安，因為治安問題得到解決後，才能使人民眞正的復員，這這在是賢明的見地，但記者還以為在治安的時候，更須兼及吏治的澄淸，因為吏治如果不澄淸，則除了有形的盜匪，却還存在着無形的盜匪，無形的盜匪，又能釀成有形的盜匪。沈主席標榜不用私人，到現在止，確未用什麼私人，我們相信這澄淸吏治的一點，沈主席也有決心的。不過澄淸吏治的先愉條件，就是要提高公務人員的待遇。現在縣級高級公務員，薪津月僅五萬元，如何維持一家大小，關於這，我們希望在這次行政會議中有具體的議決案。</p>
<p>沈主席復揭示本年另一重要目標為救濟，如千縣普遍的衣食住問題的解決，如果衣食住問題不能解決，所有治安的設施還是空的，這也實在是切要之圖，不過衣食住問題的解決，實在並不是一件易事，我們希望各區各縣都有一具體的計劃，提出來供給大家研究，我們知道這救濟的計劃，首先必須要錢，浙江省現在眞是窮困萬狀提際見肘之際，何來這龐大的款項？如果各區各縣有縝密的計劃，或者以工代賑，或者加緊造產，這也未始沒有成功的希望，所以我人願意在這次行政會議中能夠知道可以實施的救濟計劃。</p>
<p>外銷產品不景氣</p>
<p>本省本來是農產豐富的社會，就地理言，浙省不適於工業而適於農業，她農業的產品除榖麥大　外，其他大宗的桐油，茶葉，　都是外銷的產品，這許多外銷的產口，現在也已瀕臨不景氣的境地，應該如何改良？如何增產？如何使生產這許多產品的人能夠安居樂業，這實在也是當前很重要的課題。我們知道這許多產品也可以使它進入工業化的，即是把朱始的農產品，經過工業的過程，再行銷國外，不過這些計劃要有大魄力遠眼光的人始能做的，我們希望各區各縣，對於這外銷有過成績的特產品，加以研究而提供具體的意見，因為這外銷的結果也是增加浙江的財富的。</p>
<p>行政會議，出席人員除省府委員　處長及各區專員縣長各廳處科長以上人員一百三十餘人舉行十天，在這十天的光陰中，我們相信一定有很好的決議案，尤其沈主席事先就有適切的提示，循着這提示，一定有很好的意見。「浙江是個健康的人」，不過現在是患着嚴重的傷寒病，官吏本來就是醫生，行政會議就等於是醫師會議，看這醫師會議，有什麼良藥來醫沼這嚴重的病人？有什麼好的藥方來施行起死回生之術？</p>

<p>下筆之始，記者欲特別解釋一下「奸」的意義：因為這個「奸」字，在香港的涵義和在國內的涵義也許各有不同。而這個差別就是本文作意的所在。在香港，「奸」者所背叛的對象，有（一）盟國（包括中英在內），（二）英國和（三）中國之分。第一種稱中「戰犯」，第二種叫做「附敵分子」，第三種，才叫「漢奸」——我國懲治漢奸條例所指的漢奸，即指這一種。本文亦就這個區別，試談香港肅奸的經過。</p>
<p>戰犯受審</p>
<p>據香港英國陸軍總部宣佈，現囚於赤拉監獄的戰犯共有二百餘人。香港方面對「戰犯」作何解釋？據香港陸軍軍事法庭公審第一批戰犯時，主控官說：國際法規定佔領者最重要之舉，歐為對當地人民生活，須予尊重，其安居樂業不愛騷擾，其宗敎信仰不受干涉，對彼等不得加以威脅，非法及刑案。凡未遵守此項法則者，屬於違法背乎戰爭慣例，而跑旱船視為最重要　大戰爭罪犯。」屬於這一類的人物，都是日本軍人。</p>
<p>從三月二十八日公審首批戰犯起，至屬稿的現在止，已審判了六批，共計戰犯二十三人，計判死刑者五人，其餘分別判監，多則八年，少則兩年。</p>
<p>公審戰犯和公審其他犯人一樣，准許平民觀審、但戰犯祇經軍事法庭一度審訊。即可判決。而「附亂份子」却經裁判署——軍政時期呌簡易法庭——和高級法庭兩重審訊，雖同有證人作供和辦護律師申辯，但手續比較快捷，由提堂之日至判決，至多不過一月，故一百天內，便審判了六批。而附敵分子，雖有四批提堂，但首批六人，因個別審訊，到了現在，尚未戰事。茲將各批戰犯公審經過，簡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）首批戰犯十五人，被控於一九四五年八月十八日至八月二十六日，虐待及殺戮大嶼山銀鑛灣居民，三月二十八日開審，至四月二十五日判結：岸保夫中尉（駐守日軍中隊隊長），松本中尉和內田軍曹三人被判死刑。柳澤准尉，神城下士，監禁十年。吉川士監禁八年，兒玉軍曹監禁五年，肅藤中士，准竹中士，西澤下士，植村下士，岡本下士，監禁兩年，安藤准士，城森軍曹，高橋一等兵，無罪釋放。</p>
<p>（二）戰犯日憲　兵松田賢一上士，綽號「老虎仔」，五月十日被判虐待華人李錦滿以致斃命，十四日判決，監禁八年。</p>
<p>（三）戰犯日憲兵通譯井上金尾，綽號「揂人王」，五月廿二日被控虐待戰俘和平民，廿七日判決死刑。</p>
<p>（四）戰犯日憲兵四名，五月卅日被控虐待華人七名，六月十一日判決：佐野伍長監禁八年，黑澤准尉監禁六年，飯田軍曹（綽號華南灌水王）監禁三年，坂本軍曹無罪。</p>
<p>（五）戰犯日憲兵大村淸准尉，七月二日被控虐待華人六名，四日判決監禁七年。</p>
<p>（六）戰犯日憲兵川本軍曹，七月九日被控虐待英人一名致死，十日判死刑。</p>
<p>昔日香港日憲兵隊長野問賢之助，代表香港日軍投降的岡田少將，指揮日軍進攻香港的酒井隆中將等，亦經列為香港戰犯。香港陸軍軍事法庭現正蒐集證據，除酒井隆已由我國在南京審訊外，其他各犯，日內將可陸續提訊。</p>
<p>附敵份子</p>
<p>港府二月七日曾正式宣佈：凡「在日人佔領期內曾歸附或協助日人；或行動國對盟國作戰目標不利；或曾干犯香港政府的防禦法例；或對本港刑事法律犯重大罪惡」；都一律當作戰犯War　Oriminale如此說法，則戰犯與我國所指的「漢奸」無甚分別。當第一號附敵分子黃佐治公這審時，主控官便正式替附敵分子High　Treason下了一個定義，那是「達背一三五一年通敵法案（愛德華第五次第三章）而犯有在本港及屬土通敵叛逆罪」的人。換句話說，那是對英皇不忠或「當英皇及臣民方與日本軍民公開作戰時作賣國之行為」的人。所以附敵分子有一個先決條件，他或她必須是英國人，或入了英籍的人，或至少是曾經宣誓對英皇效忠的人。因為有這個關鍵，黃佐治的辯護律　便洋洋灑灑的申辯：黃是中國人，不應受英國法律管理。又說，香港在淪陷後已非英屬土而為日佔領地，其居民無須效忠英皇。另一個附敵分子徐國楨的辯護律師也說：「被告非英國籍人，凡華人皆可自由來往中國香港間，可主在港之華人，不一定要盡忠皇室」。</p>
<p>當戰犯提審的前夕，當局為了蒐集廣大民衆的證據，特將戰犯的照片一百六十八個，分作兩批，陳列於交通中心地點。以中英文寫道：「君認識彼否」又道：「如君有關係彼等內之某一人犯有戰罪，如殘暴行為，酷刑虐待等消息者，請記者照片號數，到來匯豐銀行大厦四樓三零五號房為盼」。但提審附敵分子，却沒有這個手續。出庭指證附敵分子過去附敵行為的證人，大半都是受附敵分子摩折過的英方諜報人員及其家屬，其中一個，甚至是現在法庭上但任政府主控律師的人。附敵分子之一的黎傑被判死刑後，曾在公堂上憤然作辨說：「余對判決極感不公平，因各證人所供口詞，甚多錯誤，且多為串成者。現在余雖被判死刑，然余非一怕死者，惟極欲將是案之始末，公諸社會，使社會有理智之人士，自為公道之評判，余覺更不公平者，為現在本港有不少更重要之叛逆人，仍得逍遙法外，或已被捕而卒得放釋，而如我之不重要之人，竟愛嚴厲裁判云云。</p>
<p>第一號附敵分子黃佐治被判死刑後，已於七月十日在赤柱監獄內受了絞刑。——他是英軍重入香港後第二個受絞刑的人，第一個是一個殺了養母的螟蛉子。據港府發表第一批附敵分子的名單，共有六人。除黃佐治外，尚有蘇良，徐國楨，黎傑，李傑士（葡人）和基寗（瑞典人）。自二月十九日提堂後，即個別公審。黃被控共犯了卅一款罪名。徐自供稱前任廣州市市長「陳策為其間接上司」，主月廿七日被判死刑。蘇良還在審訊中。黎傑綽號「九龍第一號密偵」，「其殘暴行為比敵寇尤甚」，五月卅日被判死刑。被控包括協敵將西安輪由澳駛港」的李蔡士，現尚在押候審訊中。被控包括「在九龍指示敵人砲兵以本港為射擊目標」的基寗，四月十七日公審時，其辯護律師因「根據英國政府寬限措施，凡對於被指為有助敵之疑犯，而查悉其無殘暴行為者，則不能提出控訴」，而獲赦免釋放這個寬限措施便宜了不少其他尚未公佈的「附敵分子」！但基寗最後由港府終身驅逐出境。</p>
<p>第二批附亂分子，計有印人五名，華人二名。第三批計有西人三名，印人一名，華人五名。第四批華人九名，華人五名。第四批華人九名，都已先後提堂，除西人三名業已繳保釋出外，其他犯人，迄未有任何一個已判決者。據五月四日報載，當局已準備將一批附敵分子遞解出境，內有西人四名，印人一名，華人十名。那些被押在獄的，到了本月，已有人喊出請求法官從速判決的呼聲。</p>

<p>在自治領會議中，有一趣事：英首相艾德禮在下院宣布，英國準備完全撤退竢及境內的駐軍時，反對黨領袖邱吉爾起來質問政策這項決策，事先有否徴求過各自治領同意。還是造成旣成事實後要他們認可。答稱事先徴得同意。但實際並非如此，加拿大首先抗議，未事先徴得同意，澳門亦發牢騷，謂當此各　自治領正在討論如何增強其對帝國決策之參加時，政府有發中此重要決定，竟未事先徴得自治領同意。于是下院中又是一場口舌風波，經過多少解釋後方了事。同時各自治領對母國外交政策方面，似頗效旁敲側擊之勞。（雪岩卅日寄自敦倫）</p>

<p>編者先生：我們的學校—敎育部特設上海臨時大學補習班附設大學先修班，於本月七日第二學期考試完畢，也可說臨大先修班將與世永別了，回憶先修班開學迄今已有四個餘月，在此時中，溫習了中學全部之課程，工經過兩次嚴之學期筆試，我們這班學生們雖來自四方，然我們的目標是同一方針的—希望保送國立大學。現學期結束，敎育部與學校當局未見有佈告關於我們先修班學生的升學問題。想到這點，羨慕在偽時跳級之學生，從前和我們同級者及較低者，現已在大二大三等肄業，而敎育部對於此輩學生很原諒，從甄審辦法可證明。現上海敎育局奉部令開始舉辦收復區中等學校畢業生甄審，未知我們是否也要同樣甄審？我們要求敎育部對上海臨大附設先修班學生保送國立大學和甄審兩大問題，早日公告，以，免學生們久等，誤過大學入學考試之日期！（汪伯民·蔡中正，劉大圭）</p>

<p>主筆先生：滬江，東吳等大學，都設有夜班，純為職業靑年而設，但却需要高中畢業證書。本人是一小學畢業者，理應再去升學，乃因環境所迫，不得不使我業學就商。但我對於求學仍不能忘懷。雖然在補習夜校中補民。但補習的却是一所沒有系統的學校。與本人同等遭遇者，一定不在少數。故我希望各大學夜班中另附完全中學夜班。在夜班中學中所畢業者，能升入大學班，而讓我們一般小學畢業者亦能苦學而得到學士之位。未知各校執事先生可能採納否？（羅嘉未　上）</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們是做工的人，我們在安達路廿號，同濟機織印染廠做工，兩月以來，無不早到而遲退，以盡職責，而今來貨不乏，進出甚湧，該廠突於七月二日上午九時，向我等解僱四十餘人，當時我們即推委代表一人，問伊解僱之理由，彼謂本廠係有規則例，凡進廠工人，三個月後，升為長工，現在你們才有兩個多月，所以亦在臨時工之例，本廠可以隨時解訣。</p>
<p>但是，依社會局規則，臨時工的待遇，須超過長工人，百分之卅五，但是我們臨時工的待遇，祇有長工五分之四，而日廠方不是沒有生意，倘若沒有生意，而全部閉息，我們決不無理要求，這好走到失業的路上去。</p>
<p>又我們當時即請，第三區染織業產業公會，派員向廠方要求復工，承工會派會員徐文華，李司勳兩位，至廠再度要求復工，該廠長何裕棠，即向工會會員，提出這樣的條件說，這批工人，他們是在六月卅日以前進廠的，現在要他們過去做的兩個多月，實行沖消，不得繼續後來日期，而升長工，否則，定予解僱。</p>
<p>我們謹請各界人士措敎，他這道理對不對？我們失業後將何以為生。　（同濟新工人）</p>

<p>我們是蘇北流亡的一羣，我們的家鄕，從勝利後就先後為共產軍佔據，而被稱為所謂「解放區」了。經過了共產軍的「三資」「三平」「三光」……等的政策，數千萬的同胞正處於水深火熱之中，我們不願聽受他們的蹂躪（根本不容許存在），相率的先後流亡南來，鹿集於京滬一帶已不下三百餘萬人。斷斷續續的停戰協談，如蘇北地區，容許中共駐軍兩師，駐於准安及其以北，我們堅決反對。因為這不是像敵偽時代一樣麽？從淮安分成「華中」「華北」之區別，來分化整個再在共黨轄治下而還鄕，我們要求政府保全江蘇省的軍政令的統一；不但蘇北，全國各地也都應有軍政軍令統一之權能。我們流亡同胞，目前雖然得到政府的黨視與救濟，各方的同情與勸募，來作暫時的安慰，但終不是長久之計。我們畢竟要還鄕的，頋政府和公正人士協助。（淮淮漣泗宿沐等縣流亡浦東難民鄭淸·沈其才·徐燦文等同啟</p>

<p>抗戰期間，「軍事第一；建國期間，敎育第一。」許多敎育價都已發出了緊急的呼籲，爲了趕快恢復國家的元氣，他們要求加緊當前教育界的復員，要求當局撥付更多的敎育經費，全國人士一致起來努力救濟失學兒童。</p>
<p>誠然，兒童們做了多少工作？</p>

<h3 id="c121">文學的敏感 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 凱音</p>
<p>文藝工作者永遠是走在時代的最前面的，創作的事業是一件靈魂探險的工作。我們說文藝工作者要又異於常人的的敏感，其意義即在於敏感是一種先知先覺的表徵，沒有敏感，不能使一個作家在廣大的生活裏抓住最誘惑的東西，表現最重要的東西，敏感是文藝工作者的智慧的觸角。</p>
<p>敏感與所謂「神經過敏」絕不相同。前者是根據正確的立塲對於未被發現的事物之一種預感，而後者則是一種自我意識，是一種病態的錯覺。通常自我意識發展得太畸形的時候，就形成了神經過敏的徵象。我們的所說文學的敏感，應該是通過主觀的冷靜的觀察而認識了客觀的必然性。因為敏感，所以作家的題材是不會枯竭的，他決不是渾渾然地再羣眾中間生活，而是隨時隨地保留着一份深切的關心，如果文藝工作者本身麻木不仁，對事物以無所謂得淡然態度，則其敏感決不是健全的。</p>
<p>次之有人把敏感與靈感的意義混同，這是錯誤。靈感之為物，是極抽象的，它只是情緒發展到與寫作慾望的諧和，其主要意義在於因為寫作慾的燃燒而成功一篇創作。敏感可是不同了，這是存在與未來之間的具體事物之追求，是在生活的觀察上，而不在寫作的實踐上。強調靈感的大抵是浪漫主義的寫作者，他們以為靈感一來，文思便如泉湧，於是乎偉大的作品產生；但敏感卻不這樣，這像新聞記者的鼻子一樣，對尙在醞釀的事情也能推測其可能的發展，或者因此而獲得採訪新聞的綫路，敏感是在日常生活中隨時起作用的，要觀察得深刻，沒有敏感的導引難免於失敗。</p>
<p>譬如說牛頓，因為看見蘋菓樹上掉下來，在常人大槪不會去注意，他卻驚奇不置，因此而硏究其原因，這可說是一種對自然現象的敏感，是可珍貴的。</p>
<p>作家與社會自然科學家一樣，需要冷靜的頭腦觀察事物，分析現象，需要謹慎而小心的硏究態度，敏感不過是條件之一吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c122">背影（小說）（下） <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 中一</p>
<p>如驥噴出一大口濃煙，從煙層裏睨視着小石，默默不答一語。接着，又吸了四五口煙纔有氣無力地說：</p>
<p>「我知道，我知道我不應這樣做，然而環境却不允許我不！我覺得有一股強烈的力量在驅策我；我極度地需要着，那背影！」說着，很堅決地點點頭。</p>
<p>「……」小石現在開始覺得他的確用不到在規勸了；因為他已經說明他「需要」那背影！他需要吃飯，你能勸他不吃嗎？多勸，非但不能動移他的主張，說不定反會使他的信心更鞏固,更牢不可拔的！於是他闔上了眼皮，靜靜地思索，額角上一條條佈滿了皺紋。暫時地，他好似已經忘了室內尙坐着一個朋友，他祗自顧自專心地動着腦筋。</p>
<p>如驥又看了一次手錶，懶懶地拿起帽子，露出欲去的樣子，他把剩下短短的煙捲塞在嘴裏努力地吸着，低聲說：「很抱歉地害你平白浪費掉許多光陰，小石，我現在覺得相當暢快，因為心胸中　積着的煩悶都已傾吐出來，發洩掉了！唉，但不知以後得進展又是怎樣？假使你不嫌麻煩的話，我想——我仍想借你的耳朶作為滌除我煩惱的工具！此刻，我要——」</p>
<p>小石在沈思的狀態裏，對於如驥的話語一句也不曾入耳，直到如驥口中吐出「我要」兩字，纔像從夢中醒來一樣，輕快地走到如驥身邊，把手按在他肩上，怡然地說：</p>
<p>「嗨，如驥，我找到辦法了！我可以解救你！我可以使你快樂！」</p>
<p>如驥的頭抬得高高地，不動聲色仍舊玩着煙霧，等了一會纔漠不關心地問道：</p>
<p>「是嗎？」</p>
<p>「喔，難道我還哄你？」</p>
<p>「那末請問你有甚麼辦法呢？說啊。」</p>
<p>小石撚了撚鼻子，揑住如驥的手道：</p>
<p>「這……暫且還不便發表，因為，你太執拗了，如若告訴了你，或許會鬧不贊成，不願意，這一套，所以，我想還是不宣布來得穩妥！總之如驥，我立誓盡力幫你解決這個難題就是了！至於採取怎麼樣的步驟，你可以不用管！」</p>
<p>「不，請你告訴我！」</p>
<p>「不，不能告訴你！你太缺乏忍耐心了！此刻時間的的確不早，你快同府龍，過兩天通電話跟你接洽好了！」</p>
<p>小石的所謂「辦法」，其實並非甚麼出奇的妙計，他不過計劃着把如驥的思想從閔玉和背影的圈子裏轉移到別處去，使他忘去背影，而到其他事物裏去尋覓快樂，尋覓意趣！這樣的一個辦法假使能够實現，當然是極圓滿的；事實上除了它，也沒有其他方法可以減除如驥的痛苦了！不過，如驥自己似乎也曾試騐過這辦法，而結果是失敗的，例如他讓工作和讀書來佔去他的時間，他到無錫去等等，但是結果總是不能解脫，總是跳不出痛苦的回憶所築成的圍牆！</p>
<p>那末這樣看來，這個辦法並無甚麼成効嘛，怎麼小石竟會很有把握地對他說有辦法解救他呢？原來小石在沉思的時候，把這件事仔細地分析過後，已發覺了如驥失敗的癥結所在！他以為如驥的辦法——其實也就是他自己的辦法，在原則上是絕對無暇可擊的，他的所以失敗，完全是由於他轉移思想的目標選擇得不妥，以為書籍·工作，新環境等等，都是沒有生命的東西，沒有生命的東西，其吸引人注意力的効能，當然難免要比有生命，有活力的東西薄弱得多！所以小石準備把如驥的思想引導到一個有生命有活力的目標上去！</p>
<p>他記得他訂婚的那天，賓客中曾經有一位年輕美麗的小姐，名呌孫芸，十分引起了在座各個來賓的注意！這位孫小姐是他未婚妻的很親密的同學，若論她的面貌，她的體態，實在够稱得上一個「美」字！施小姐——他的未婚妻，也是堪稱美的，不過施小姐的美是恬靜，淑嫻的美，而孫小姐的美却是活潑　輕盈的美！這樣一位活潑，聰明，美貌的小姐，無論誰見了，都會禁不住羡慕不置的！所以小石認為要是介紹她與如驥認識了，如驥必定不能抗拒她的誘惑力！同時如驥本身也是個相當英俊的靑年；孫小姐的豔麗，配上如驥的英俊，似乎是適合也沒有了！</p>
<p>不過如驥沒有看見她以前，沒有忘掉閔玉以前，恐怕是不會贊成這項提議的，因為非常固執。所以唯一的辦法是不讓他預先知道，而在突如其來的介紹以後看他的反應如何？倒底還是閔玉的魔力大呢，還是孫小姐的誘惑力強？假使是前者，那末他當然仍舊繼續地去懷念他失去了的閔玉，如果是後者，那末他就能回頭是岸來接近孫小姐了！依據小石的估計，如驥雖然鍾情閔玉，但是終究她對他巳經毫無情感可言，所以他的計劃一定能得到勝利！</p>
<p>施小姐是寄宿在學校裏的，每星期祗有兩天住在家裏。本來她訂了婚以後預備不寄宿了，不過她認為家中環境太鬧，對於讀書方面不大適宜，所以仍舊決定宿在校內　。每逢星期六她返家的時候，小石便到施家去和她敍談，星期日則是施小姐到小石家來，或是到外面去玩。</p>
<p>這一個星期日，小石便同施小姐約定了邀請孫小姐和如驥一塊兒去看電影，小石的計劃，施小姐自然表示贊成，他倆預料在電影院裏，進去的時候是一個雙擋和兩個單擋，出來的時候却會二二得四，變成兩個雙擋了！</p>
<p>如驥到達電影院時，其餘三人已經等了好久了，施小姐和孫小姐因為嫌戲院門口塵埃飛揚，所以等在裏面扶梯旁邊，但是小石怕如驥來了找不到他們，所以獨白　立在門口等候。</p>
<p>「對不起，對不起，我來遲了！」如驥喘息着。</p>
<p>「嗯，没有關係，」小石嬉皮笑臉地回答，「你向我道歉是用不着的，待會兒向她們道歉一聲倒是真的！」</p>
<p>「他（她）們？誰？」如驥笑着說，「唔，我懂了，施小姐也來的是不是？」</p>
<p>「嗯，對……等一會你自然會明白的，我們進去吧！」</p>
<p>推開玻璃門，如驥的目光向四處巡視了一周，忽然低聲呼喊道：</p>
<p>「背影！背影！」</p>
<p>小石起先愕了一愕，接着看看如骥的臉，恍然說：</p>
<p>「你又憶起了那背影？」</p>
<p>「不，小石，在這裏！背影在這裏，我與她重逢了！」</p>
<p>「哪兒？那兒？」小石性急地問。</p>
<p>「站在扶梯旁邊，穿粉紅色短大衣的！……唉，我要上去！我要……」</p>
<p>小石聽着他的话聽呆了！他拉住了如驥的衣袖，嘴唇抖呀抖的祗是說不出話來！半　纔費了九牛二虎之力，迸出一句：</p>
<p>「那，那是我的未婚妻　」　三五，三，二九。（完）</p>

<p>「小華，我來給你介紹這位我們學校得國文教員董劭凌先生，」劉子雲指着那男子說。「他的學問很好，將來你可以向他多領教，他不但學問好，而且多才；能吹能拉；會彈會唱！他差不多天天去看你的戲。他對於你的藝術非常贊賞。」</p>
<p>聽見這話張弦鼓着眼睛邪瞟董劭凌，不屑地「哼」了一聲　冷冷地說：</p>
<p>「董先生這樣博學多才的人，我們小華可是高攀不上。」</p>
<p>「師父！」置華正顏地走向張弦子。「時候不早了，你可以回去了。」說龍，並示意呌他退出。</p>
<p>「什麽？」張弦很忿然的樣子，獰笑着說！「時候不早了，可客人不還沒有走嗎？」</p>
<p>麗華簡直氣了嚴厲地喊了一聲：</p>
<p>「師父！」</p>
<p>「好了，我的墨老板！別着急，我這就走。旣是你討厭我，我上外間去坐，跟我來給小　吊吊嗓子。」說　，張弦拿起胡琴又向董劭凌積了一眼，然後索着蹬　走出去了。</p>
<p>「媽，師父像這樣沒禮貌，以後不能再呌他往咱們家裏來了！」　華氣咻咻地向墨太太說。</p>
<p>「嘖嘖嘖，他不就是這麼個人，別理他得了。」墨太太勸慰着麗華，然後也走出去。</p>
<p>這時外面胡琴響了，麗雲唱着：「賣馬」。劉子雲和董劭凌相視默然　董劭凌有些不定的樣子，直使眼色呌劉子雲走，可劉子雲偏不動，並示意制止董劭凌。</p>
<p>「劉先生！這，這就是我所以不願告訴　我的身份的原因。」麗華沉默了一會，戚然地說。</p>
<p>「小華，我早想到心裏一定有許多苦衷，趕明兒，到學校來跟我談談，不要緊直這樣憂鬱，當心會悶壞身體的。」劉子雲同情地走過去撫着麗華安慰地說。</p>
<p>「嗨！」董劭凌長嘆了一口氣，沒有說什麽，帶起帽就預備走。</p>
<p>「董先生！」麗華抬起頭，含淚地着他說：「眞對不起您！」</p>
<p>「沒什麼！」董劭凌也有些　然了。又向劉子雲催促着。「我們走吧！」</p>
<p>劉子雲這才點了點頭，把雨衣被起來。一面拍了拍麗華。</p>
<p>「不要難過，明兒到學校來玩！」說罷，劉子雲便走出去。</p>

<p>上海的交通情況，照這樣下去，那是一個可怕的未來。</p>
<p>從北四川路底乘一路電車到山西路，平均總得花費五十分鐘，而等車的時間，自十分鐘至半點鐘，得看你的運氣了。</p>

<h3 id="c127">起死回生 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 東方荆</p>
<p>「蘇聯科學家試驗結果已有五十一各平民，死了又活過來。」</p>
<p>在過去，人是分成兩大類的：活的和死的。在生與死之間，有一個顯著的界限，一旦走入了「另一個世界」，就再也回不到人間了——除非有一種不可思議的奇蹟發生。</p>
<p>其中多數人，復生德時期很短促，不過數小時或數天而已。他們吃，喝，談天，甚至寫信，但重要器官所受到的損傷，終致不救。</p>
<p>五十一個人中，有十二個人迄今還活着，過着常人的生活。</p>
<p>這些蘇聯科學家所用的方法很簡單，死掉之後，儘可能快地施救，注射溫暖的血液，混合着肾上腺化合物，及葡萄糖，到支動脈中——到達心臟的捷徑。在高度的壓力下，這種混合物能夠引起心臟的收縮，使得血液從動脈流入靜脈中去。</p>
<p>同時，醫師使用人工呼吸法，恢復死人的呼吸，這往往要繼續較久，或許要繼續到恢復生命後一小時，直至病人能夠自由呼吸。</p>
<p>蘇聯醫學界試驗結果告訴我們，人體中最軟弱的部份，不是心臟，而是神經系統。它是長期貧血，最先死亡的。</p>
<p>尼哥夫斯基醫師，向全世界的一聲宣佈道：「我們不能因病人心臟和呼吸的停止，而放棄自己的努力，仍當繼續爭取病人的生命，尤其那些暴卒的病人。……停止跳動的心臟，有時會重新跳動的。」</p>
<p>現在，科學對於生死有了不同的解說。生與死之間，並沒有一個斷然的距離，旣使一個人踏入了死亡的領域，他也還有機會，回到活的世界來。</p>
<p>這就是說，在你死了以後，你還有機會活過來。這並非僅是聳人聽聞的理論，已經有五十一個人，使用這種新方法，從死亡中救活。</p>
<p>在目前，救活一個死的人，死亡的時間不能太長，大約是五分鐘左右。但，重要的是，死人是可以救活的。那些因昏厥，流血過其他能治愈病症而死的人，獲得了新的生機。</p>
<p>這種起死回生的技術，是蘇聯健康部的尼哥夫斯基博士和他的副手們硏究出來的。最初他們施用這種技術，救活陣亡的士兵，現在施用於民間。他們並把一切資料和技術，供給美國及其他各國的醫師。</p>
<p>從生到死　幾個階段</p>
<p>尼哥夫斯基起死回生技術的根據，是人體各部份，並非同時死亡的。他發現：「死亡並不是生命的突然中止；從生到死，包括好幾個過渡的階段。」</p>
<p>所以，心臟雖然停止，身體中的其他各部份，可能仍舊活着，醫師可以宣佈這個人死了，並不是「生物學上的死」（人體中各部份全都死亡），他往往還有復活的可能。</p>
<p>紅軍中有一個小兵，呌齊里滿諾夫，臀部受了重傷，搬到醫院時，巳經完全失掉了知覺。把他扛到了手術檯上，但情形愈來愈糟。最後，心臟停了，呼吸斷了，神經反應消失了。</p>
<p>外科醫師照例報吿：「昏厥及流血過多致死。」</p>
<p>就在這時，尼哥夫斯基醫師走了進來。三分鐘以後，他開始工作。過了一分鐘以後，他開始工作。過了一分鐘，齊里潘諾夫的心臟開始跳動；過了三分鐘，他開始呼吸；一小時以內，他恢復了知覺。</p>
<p>不久以後，他睡着了。呌到他的名字，他睜開了眼睛，回答問題。他要水喝。他的呼吸是平時勻的，脈搏也正常。</p>
<p>到了今天，齊里潘諾夫活得很好，他簡直不能相信，他是死過一次的人。</p>
<p>死後世界究竟如何</p>
<p>有一個新聞記者問他，在另一個世界中，看沒看見什麽有趣的事物。抓抓頭皮，抱歉地答道：「實際上，我沒看見甚麼，在死去的一刹那，我已失去了知覺，直到動過手術以後，才恢復了知覺。像是受過了一次麻醉。」</p>
<p>尼哥夫斯基博士說，死人首先失掉的是知覺；起死回生，最後恢復的知覺。病人並不知道死亡的開始，所以對死後的一切也茫無所知。</p>
<p>齊里潘諾夫是尼氏救活的五十一個死人之一。所以這些人。全是由於內臟或四肢受了重傷，普通施救方法無效而死的。</p>

<p>勝利后的許多接收人，似乎都向大處着眼，因此忽略了小的，就像本文所記之全市這大批自警團員的鋼盔竟被大眾忘記得一乾二淨，不亦悲乎。</p>
<p>而且這種鋼盔，現在是成為廢物，那麼物何不利用？何況凡是公家的東西，不論一草一木，應該涓滴歸公，我的意思是，這大批的鋼盔，應由本市軍事機關，責成保甲長追究，着令藏匿者獻出，倘有巴遺失者須照市價賠償，因為對於佔有者毫無用塲可派，而許多軍隊的同志們，鋼盔的配備則尙付缺如收回歸公，並且手續並不麻煩，那何樂而不為咧。</p>

<p>你那份勸於服務和體恤下人的精神，是任何家庭主婦所沒有的；每天黎明即起，往往搶在葉媽的前頭，先掃除了臥房，就下樓到廚房裏去，把煤球爐生號，接着　水煮粥，讓兒女們一一起身盥洗早餐，可以不誤時間的去教書唸書或辦事；葉媽上小菜塲去時，你又忙着揀米淘米，把甚麼都預備好了，然後自己用早餐，有時竟忘俄了，俄上一頓。我見你食少事繁，他辛苦了，總勸你節勞；你回說；「葉媽一個人忙不過來，孩子們要回來吃中飯的，我趁早預備好了，也可放心。」我多說也沒用，只得由你。午後間了一些，你又忙着做針綫，戴起了眼鏡，做一個無休無歇，還得縫補我們破了的衣袴，綻了的鞋襪；孩子們雖然都已長大，出外都穿皮鞋，而在家中所穿的布底鞋，都由你一手製成。廿九年來，連同母親的在內，不知巳做了幾千百雙了；做鞋面還不算難，而那細針密　的鞋底，都是既費力，又費時，連那　針的兩指之間也起了繭了。總之你是處處在　我節省開支，替我打算盤，廿九年如一日。至於娛樂，在這九年國難期間，可說是等於零:有時因為我的母親和你的母親嬸母都愛打牌，便勉強的　上一脚，在你簡直是義務，算不得娛樂。</p>
<p>去冬，我家已決定遷回蘇州故　了，我幾次三番邀你出去看一本五彩電影，吃一頓你所愛吃的西餐，你卻推三阻四的沒有應允，說：「爺，省省吧，還是讓我在家裏休息，你獨個兒去好了。」你有時出外，最遠的地方就是到迪化路母家去，連靜安寺一帶也不肯涉足，說是「一到那邊，看了商店中光怪陸離的櫥窗，免不得又要化你的錢了。」有一次，繳報館送來了幾千塊錢的稿費，我隨手交給了你，你接在手中，竟洞下眼淚來，抱抱咽咽的說：「爺，這是你一個月來把心血換來的，我怎麼忍心化用呢？」我忙說：「寫這種文章是很容易的，不用費甚麼心血；何況像你這樣能體恤我，就是嘔盡心血，我也心甘情願的啊！」當下你推了好一會，方始接受了。</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] According to information received: Chairman Chiang will issue a proclamation within the next two to three days, the contents of which are extremely important and aimed at the current situation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] It is learned that Chairman Chiang has cancelled his planned inspection of Nanchang. After listening to the report from Chairman Wang Ling-chi, the Chairman gave instructions in person on all matters.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] According to reliable information: Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to leave here by plane at 12:30 tomorrow afternoon to return to Nanjing. Marshall will not descend the mountain for another two or three days. At 4:30 this afternoon, Chairman Chiang and the Ambassador held a one-hour discussion, the content of which was not released. At 7:30 in the evening, Ambassador Stuart received reporters from this newspaper for a ten-minute conversation. The reporter asked three questions, which the Ambassador answered one by one: (1) What is the Ambassador's impression of Lushan? (Answer) Very good, very good. The trees have grown up and are much better than they were twenty years ago. (2) What are the Ambassador's views on the UNRRA's order to suspend the shipment of some relief supplies to China? (Answer) China's most serious problem at present is transportation. Given this undeniable fact, I hope all parties will be patient regarding the UNRRA's aforementioned measures. (3) What is the Ambassador's view of the situation in China? (Answer) I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic. However, I will do my best with the greatest enthusiasm to fulfill my responsibilities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Hu Dingfen, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] "Important developments in the current situation are expected in the next two or three days." This hint was given to reporters by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart Leighton, today at the creek near his residence. The Ambassador visited Chairman Chiang at 4:30 PM on the 19th for his first meeting since taking office, and left after more than an hour. The Ambassador, suffering from a cold, did not accompany Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall to see the moonrise over 向鄱口. After returning to his residence, he took a walk by the creek. The reporter approached him to exchange greetings and ask questions amid the gurgling water. Besides asking the reporter to pay attention to the important developments in the situation in the next two or three days, the Ambassador also felt that the future of the situation was particularly optimistic because China's current difficulties were not external threats but domestic personnel issues. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could put themselves in each other's shoes and understand each other, various problems could be gradually resolved. When the reporter asked about the "content of today's conversation between the Ambassador and the Chairman," the Ambassador replied, "The Chairman and I have been old friends for many years, so the conversation was very relaxed and pleasant." When the reporter asked, "How long does the Ambassador plan to stay here?" he replied, "I will fly back to Nanjing tomorrow noon."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] According to reliable information: Stuart Leiden will present Chairman Chiang with a letter from President Truman.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] Chen Cheng and Bai Chongxi will come to Lushan together in the next few days. Chen will stay at No. 101 Hedong Road, and Bai will stay at No. 197-2 in the Lion Forest. The houses have been cleaned and prepared.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] It is widely rumored here that Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng will go to Lushan together tomorrow.

Since you call on the people with democracy, constitutionalism, peace, and unity, may I ask what your intention is in such rhetoric? This kind of propaganda constitutes open defamation and insult to individuals. I hereby send a special letter requesting you to formally correct this statement and ask you to pay attention to the political and legal responsibilities of such remarks.

<h3 id="e19">Chen Cheng Talks About the Conflict in Northern Jiangsu; The National Army Was Forced to Defend Itself; The Communist Army Forged Orders Before the Attack <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, met with reporters from this newspaper alone at his private residence at 8:30 PM tonight to talk about the current situation in Northern Jiangsu. It is said that the National Army in Northern Jiangsu was completely forced to take self-defense actions and never attacked the Communist army. The situation in the three areas of Datong, Jinan, and Xinyang is the same. Chief of Staff Chen also told reporters that before launching an offensive in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army forged an "order" claiming that it was obtained from the National Army and presented this "order" to Special Envoy Marshall in an attempt to reverse black and white and cover up its crimes. The content of the "order" stated that the National Army, in coordination with the Navy and Air Force, would launch an offensive against the Communist army on the 15th of this month, including (1) the Eighth Army of the Army, directly commanded by the Ministry of National Defense, (2) the Navy, which was in charge of the Second Fleet. Marshal Marshall, a world-renowned military expert, smiled at this naive forgery "order". Chief of Staff Chen said with a smile that the National Army has never had the number of the Eighth Army in Northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the Ministry of National Defense has a machine to command the national army, so why bother to directly command an Eighth Army. As for the Chinese Navy, it has never had the name "Second Fleet," and the coast of Northern Jiangsu is all sandy beaches, so the Navy cannot be used at all. From this analysis, the Communist army's inferior means of forging documents have been self-defeating. But the Communist army, with this ridiculous forged order, launched an offensive in Northern Jiangsu on the 13th, claiming "preemptive strike," which is clearly a planned conspiracy. Chief of Staff Chen finally said that facts speak louder than words, and the people of the whole country are the best judges. I certainly don't want to say more.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Reverend Allen, a missionary in China, said at a meeting of the China Aid Committee today: "It is expected that the food problem in China will be resolved by the end of August.

<h3 id="e23">Central Committee Member Pan Gongzhan Meets with Reporters; Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation; Chinese Politics is Like a Burst Appendix - Urgently Needs a Doctor to Cut Away the Rotten Part <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[This City News] Almost every reporter has this experience: "Important figures in power are much harder to see than those out of power." If every important figure is difficult to see, then Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan is an exception.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, he received reporters at his private residence wearing a white silk long gown. Beneath his graying short hair was a kind and amiable face, making the reporter forget that he was an important figure. He readily expressed some views on political and economic issues to the reporters. He compared the stalemate in Chinese politics to a patient with a burst appendix, urgently needing a good doctor to diagnose and treat, and the rotten part must be cut away in order to prevent the patient's life from falling into danger. He believed that looking at the Twenty-Four Histories of China, there was only suppression of internal chaos. The so-called civil war, only the American Civil War could be called that. The communist troops in northern Jiangsu, although they have agreed to withdraw the troops originally stationed in the area, but the government cannot hand over the regime, then how can the government's military administration be unified? The peaceful unification of the country cannot be realized entirely because the Communist Party does not have the sincerity to negotiate.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Huang Yanpei's letter to the Communist Mao Zedong, Mr. Pan believes that why did Mr. Huang not publicly publish the letter? There are so many refugees in northern Jiangsu, why did Mr. Huang not go to northern Jiangsu? Mr. Pan said with a sigh, "Return from Yan'an" has harmed many people. Before the truth about the murder of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, members of the Central Executive Committee of the Democratic League, in Kunming is revealed, reporters should not immediately report it as a political assassination. The government must thoroughly investigate this incident.</p>
<p>On China's current economic situation, Mr. Pan believes that politics and economics are intertwined. Unless politics returns to normal, China's economy cannot be fully improved.</p>
<p>He also said: "Although American goods are flooding China now, however, at present, before China's industry and commerce have recovered, the import of American goods can also delay the rise in domestic prices, but we must distinguish between the need for imported goods."</p>
<h3 id="e24">The National Flag of the Kuomintang: Never a Specially Licensed Monopoly <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department stated that the manufacture of the national flag of the Kuomintang is freely manufactured and sold by merchants in various places in accordance with the specifications and sizes determined by the Central Government. No merchant has ever been specially licensed to operate it exclusively. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous people have set up a China Kuomintang Political Flag Manufacturing and Sales Office in Shanghai, claiming national patent rights, and setting up branches in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, advertising themselves in newspapers. Such illegal organizations have also been discovered in places such as Wuxi. The personnel they send impersonate the name and force people everywhere to purchase at high prices. The Central Propaganda Department has specially sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to strictly ban such illegal organizations, and investigate and deal with such swindlers. If people in various places encounter the above situation, they can send them to the local authorities for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Zhang Jia'ao Talks About the Northeast: The Takeover Problem Still Has a Considerable Difficult Period; Reorganizing the Currency System Must Be After the Military and Political Situation Has Come to an End <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 19th] A reporter visited Zhang Jia'ao, who came to Peiping the night before, and asked a few questions. He replied as follows: (1) Regarding the unified takeover of the Northeast, it is still in the takeover period. After the various economic institutions are taken over, they will be assigned to various departments for operation according to their nature. The first priority is to resume work, but due to the limited power supply, there are still many difficulties. The Xiaofengman Power Plant is still in the hands of the communist troops on the way to Shenyang, so it cannot be used. As for the takeover situation, it is difficult to say whether it is more chaotic than within the Guannei (inside the Pass), because the situation in the Northeast is special, and there are many military units, so it is not as easy as in Peiping, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai. However, inspection work can be done without problems. There will still be a considerable difficult period in the future. Zhang replied to the question of whether "military decisions determine politics" and "politics determine economics" is putting the cart before the horse, "This is the problem of whether the hybrid egg comes first or the egg comes first. It is really difficult to say." As for how to operate the entire Northeast in the future, Zhang said that it is only in the academic research of all parties. (2) On the currency system, Zhang said that it can only be reorganized after the political work has come to an end. The issuance of banknotes will also depend on the need, and there is no need to change the exchange rate with legal tender. More than 13 billion counterfeit Manchukuo currencies were issued. (3) On the transportation problem, the transportation controlled by our side is less than one-third. Air and water transportation are out of the question. In the area controlled by us, no one participates in the Changchun Railway, except for a few Soviets in Shenyang. It is rumored that the Soviets have made new demands on us, or it is said that the Soviets have "no work to do." Therefore, the situation on the Changchun Railway from Hailar in the west to Manzhouli and from the east to Suifenhe is unknown. (4) The takeover of Lushun and Dalian is indefinite. (5) The cause of death of some of the Soviets who were killed in Changchun has been found. (6) Korean residents have also begun to be repatriated, and the Japanese residents are planned to be repatriated before the severe winter.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] Since the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in the Northeast area began, about 400,000 people have been repatriated to the area where the new army is stationed. As for the large number of Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area, the result of the repatriation plan has not yet been negotiated.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Nanjing High Court Publicly Trials Zhou Zuoren, a Traitor; His Confessions Are Evasive and Without Solid Evidence; Former Manchukuo Ambassador to Japan Sentenced to Twelve Years <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The trial of the traitor Zhou Zuoren began at 10:00 a.m. on the 19th in the High Court of the capital. It lasted two hours. Because the evidence still needs to be investigated, the court ruled that the trial would be held again on August 9th. Zhou Zuoren was slightly famous as a young man. Today, there were many young men and women in the audience. In the first part of the trial, the defendant replied to his experience before surrendering to the enemy. He was quite proud of his long tenure as a professor of arts at Peking University for 20 years. He cunningly claimed that his motive for surrendering to the enemy was to "maintain education and resist enslavement." The presiding judge reprimanded him for losing his integrity as a teacher. Zhou Zuoren replied, "The first and second-class educators have all left. People like me, who are third and fourth-class, have to come out to do their best, so that they don't read bad people of the fifth and sixth-class." He also said that he stayed in Beiping in the autumn of the 26th because he was old and was entrusted by Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, to be one of the "four professors staying in Beiping" to take care of Peking University. However, he stammered about his appointment as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the Puppet Peking University in the 28th year, the employment of puppet professors, the appointment as the Standing Committee member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee and the Director of the Department of Education in January of the 30th year, as well as the President of the East Asia Cultural Association, the Deputy Director of the North China Comprehensive Research Institute, the member of the Puppet Xinmin Association, and the Director of the Puppet North China Xinbao Newspaper, etc. He felt quite embarrassed in his answers. However, he still tried to prove that he was conducive to the War of Resistance by citing the assassination on New Year's Day in the 28th year, the debate on the "Problem of Chinese Central Thought," and the feelings of North China after the victory that he had lost his home as the president of the university. The court instructed that the evidence must be accurate and powerful, and he was given a three-week extension to collect it before the public trial. Zhou Zuoren was escorted back to prison in a fluster with sweat all over his body.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Wang Yunqing, the former ambassador of the Puppet Manchukuo to Japan, was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the High Court of the capital today, with 10 years of deprivation of civil rights, and his property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Sun Shiqing, who served as the Director of the Education Bureau of Beijing during the enemy's occupation, was sentenced by the Hebei High Court to 10 years of imprisonment, with 6 years of deprivation of civil rights, and his property was confiscated.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] Zhang Mengqi, the newly appointed Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, arrived in Hangzhou by express train on the morning of the 19th. After getting off the train, he went to the Provincial Party Department to rest. It is heard that Zhang will participate in the Provincial Administrative Conference on the 20th. The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference is scheduled to open at 8:00 a.m. on the 20th in the auditorium of the Provincial Government. Thirty-one special commissioners and county magistrates from various districts, and the director of the Land and Food Department, have already reported on the 19th. It is expected that all of them will report by the 20th. The Provincial Government also held a pre-meeting at 5:00 p.m. on the 19th to discuss all the facilities and central proposals during the conference. This newspaper believes that the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference is of great significance, so the Hangzhou office will host all the attendees at the British Dahua Restaurant on Yanling Road in Hangzhou at noon on the 20th, and will not invite the press in Hangzhou to attend.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen has repeatedly convened the heads of various departments and bureaus for secret discussions and research on proposals for half a month in order to convene the Provincial Administrative Conference. Currently, the central proposals of the conference have been held twice in the review meeting and four times in the discussion meeting. The Provincial Government has roughly put forward ten major proposals: (1) Suppressing bandits and pacifying the people. (2) Simplifying and improving the organization at all levels below the county, and improving the treatment of personnel at the county and township levels.

<h3 id="e29">Two Inexplicable Things <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps because the weather is hot, people are psychologically irritable. In addition, many things at home and abroad are often unexpected. Therefore, the news reported in the past few days often makes ordinary people incomprehensible. Let's take two things to prove my point. But we still hope that everyone can calm down, restore their senses, and not let their emotions run wild and their minds be frightened, which will only make national affairs worse.</p>
<p>First, what we find most strange is that Mr. Zhou Enlai openly stated in his speech to reporters in Shanghai the day before yesterday that Mr. Chen Lifu's mission to Shanghai was to "strengthen secret agents and arrange new political assassinations." He even falsely accused that "the names of many democratic people are already on the black list, and their lives are already in Mr. Chen's hands, so the Kunming incident can happen at any time in Beijing, Shanghai and other places." This kind of statement from the mouth of the leader of the Communist Party is not only a faux pas, but simply violates criminal law. Announcing this publicly to 60 or 70 Chinese and foreign reporters, no wonder Mr. Chen wants to send a letter to question Mr. Zhou and ask him to bear the legal responsibility for insults and defamation. But why is Mr. Zhou's emotions so agitated? Thinking about it, it is incomprehensible. Some people believe that from the recent secret documents of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be seen that they are arranging to create massacres in various places. Is Mr. Zhou saying these words because they themselves want to do it, sacrifice a few "democratic people" who have already been used, and then use them as an excuse to attack the government? According to the Chinese Communist Party's doctrine that "everyone is a tool and everything is a process," and the Chinese Communist Party's past practice of shouting that others are going to attack before they do, it may be possible to infer that this is the case. But judging from human nature, we are still unwilling to believe it and dare not believe it. Because if the Chinese Communist Party really does this, everyone will only provide them with tools. Who else would be willing to be friends with them in good faith? Therefore, after hearing Zhou Enlai's emotionally激越 (stirring) speech, we still don't understand what he really meant.</p>
<p>Second, what we also find strange is the rash action of LaGuardia, the director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), to suspend the transportation of materials to China. UNRRA is an organization jointly organized by various countries, and China is a major participating country. Everyone knows that China's eight years of resistance against Japan is in dire need of relief. Why did UNRRA lightly believe the false reports of some people in the China Branch and take such a reckless action? What is especially ridiculous is that LaGuardia himself has not even figured out the names, positions, and nationalities of the 225 people who filed the complaint, and suddenly issued this unexpected order based on his personal subjectivity! Recently, we heard a responsible senior official say that UNRRA used to supply many Chinese people with unnecessary materials, and even "fake goods" and "bad goods" were mixed in. We don't understand why UNRRA doesn't conduct a thorough investigation itself first? Moreover, UNRRA ships materials to China ship by ship without consulting China's opinions in advance, nor notifying the Chinese government. When the ship arrives at the port, it still can't produce a manifest. There is actually such a relief agency in the world. How can we blame people for distributing it slowly? As for whether it is necessary for so many foreign friends from the "UNRRA" branch in China to come to China batch by batch, let alone say, they must first take care of their food and lodging before participating in China's political role, colluding with the Chinese Communist Party from the inside and outside, and destroying the unity of China's administrative system. Is this really the original intention of relief? We think about it, think about it, and can't figure out why these foreign friends from "UNRRA" want to do this? LaGuardia said that he didn't like any foreigner, but he was hired by President Song because of his love affair. Could it be that he can make things difficult for the Chinese people who are being relieved because of this bit of spite? What is even more incomprehensible is that the "UNRRA" in China has been so corrupt in the past, the "UNRRA" has insulted China so much, and this part of the foreigners in the "UNRRA branch" has reported so recklessly, but the director of our "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (行總) didn't know anything about it beforehand? If he knew, why didn't he report it to the government and the society? Why didn't he explain the truth to various countries in advance? Why didn't he argue according to reason at the Far East Commission meeting afterwards, but instead agreed with the opinions of the representatives of other countries, thinking that LaGuardia's policy was not entirely wrong? Some people also said that Director Jiang is wholeheartedly dealing with more important matters these days, so no wonder him. If so, what else can we say!</p>

<p>The Huai River Rises and Floods</p>
<p>Affecting the Reconstruction of the Huai River Embankment; Bengbu City Intensifies Flood Prevention</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Bengbu Correspondence] Anhui Province is now in the major flood season. The clouds and rain are transporting cotton. The water levels of the Huai River upstream and downstream are rising continuously, which has greatly affected the reconstruction of the Huai River embankment undertaken by the Guidance Committee. The section from the Over-the-River Mouth on the left bank of the Huai River to Shaojia Avenue is basically completed, with a total length of 29.8 kilometers. The section from Zhengyangguan to Sanhejian cannot be constructed due to the overflowing river water, and has been temporarily suspended. A part of the Huai River embankment in Fengtai has been forced to stop construction due to the surging floods, but a part is still being processed and rushed to repair. Although the embankment from Huaiyuan to Linhuai has not been fully completed, the built embankment has reached the high level of major floodwaters. It can be used for flood prevention and will not overflow. However, the water level of the Huai River has been rising continuously in recent days. According to the observation report here on the 15th: the Huai River water level in Bengbu was 18.81 meters at 7:00 a.m., 18.82 meters at 1:00 p.m., and 18.825 meters at 7:00 p.m. If it continues to rise, the Huai River embankment may inevitably be submerged. The flood prevention agencies in Bengbu City have intensified prevention.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) of Fengxian County</p>
<p>The Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) of this county held a meeting of the Standing Committee at 3:00 p.m. on the 16th. The head of the County Land and Food Department was invited to attend. The meeting was chaired by Speaker He to discuss the issue of grain requisition in this year's land tax. Considering that the main agricultural products of this county are cotton and wool (70% cotton and 30% rice), all grain requisition in this county should be based on the standard of 70% cotton and 30% rice to show fairness and relieve the people's difficulties. It was decided that the council would submit a special report to the higher authorities for adoption, and compile statistics on the annual crop yields, grain tax, and rural economic situation of this county for provincial reference.</p>
<p>Soldier of the Songjiang Jinshan Team Executed for Drug Trafficking</p>
<p>Jiang Caihe, a soldier of the Jinshan County Security Team, was arrested by the Songjiang Water Police Headquarters in Mishidu for trafficking in heroin. A large bag of heroin was found on the spot. He was immediately escorted to the Third District Security Command for interrogation. Later, the prisoner confessed to drug trafficking without denial. He was sentenced to death according to law. At noon on the 18th, the unit took the prisoner to Yanjiatan, Maluqiao to verify his identity and execute him by shooting.</p>
<p>Changshu County Government Thoroughly Investigates Two Cases of Malpractice</p>
<p>The two major malpractice cases of the County Tenant Rent Committee and the Hupu Branch of the Autonomous Tax Department have been thoroughly investigated separately for severe punishment. Yan Shen, the former director of the Tenant Rent Committee, was decided by the Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) to be escorted for handling, and the county magistrate immediately ordered his arrest at the police station. Gu Xia, the director of the Hupu Branch of the Tax Department, abused his power for personal gain and altered tax tickets. After the county government sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts, it ordered an investigation. Magistrate Pan also stated at the morning meeting that malpractices by tax personnel must be punished and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Wuxi River Water Has Receded and Rice Prices Have Fallen</p>
<p>In early this month, there were several days of heavy rain in the county, and the river water rose by two feet. Low-lying fields were about to become marshes, and farmers were extremely anxious. The weather was clear with strong winds, and the river water has receded. The danger of low-lying fields has been lifted. On the 17th, the market price of white rice fell. High-quality white japonica rice was 56,000 yuan per stone, japonica rice was 23,500 yuan, and foreign indica rice was 21,000 yuan. The prices of other items such as Du wheat, foreign wheat, warship brand flour, and southern river soybeans also fell.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Stalin Intensifies Purge of the Military; Reorganization of the Soviet High Command; Wartime Hero Zhukov Demoted <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 19th (Broadcast): The highest Soviet authorities have implemented a military purge. Georgy Zhukov, the commander of the Soviet forces that captured Berlin, has been transferred to a less important military post. Furthermore, other highly prominent military leaders have been dismissed. The purpose of the purge is to eliminate pro-British and American elements. The British side is paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Stalin has implemented a purge among high-ranking military officers, demoting General Georgy Zhukov, the Soviet Union's number one wartime hero, to a regional commander. While no official announcement has been made regarding the reorganization, it is understood that such a reorganization is already underway. So far, the main casualty known is Zhukov, who was transferred to the post of Commander of Soviet Ground Forces three months ago and also elevated to membership in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. He is now being transferred to the Odessa Military District. It is rumored that Zhukov is not the only casualty of this reorganization. However, no other changes are yet known. It is rumored that, in essence, this military purge is already underway, although not as severe as the 1937 purge, when high-ranking Red Army officers were all dismissed and accused of collaborating with Trotsky and other political enemies, and subjected to the death penalty. Zhukov's demotion does not seem to be due to differences in political views, but rather suspicion of disloyalty to the country. While serving as the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Council in Berlin, he became a friend of Eisenhower. The successor to the post of Commander of Soviet Ground Forces has not yet been announced. He remains a member of the Politburo, the highest organ of the Soviet Communist Party. The Odessa Military District is in charge of southern Russia and the Balkan border area. Before the war, Odessa was an important military district in western Russia. The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" recently launched a major propaganda campaign to rectify Red Army discipline, with particular emphasis on the security of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Under the European "Iron Curtain"; Britain Pursues Dual Diplomacy; On One Hand, Considers Granting the Soviets Huge Loans to Restore Trade; On the Other Hand, Agrees with the US to Unify the German Economy <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Whether the European "Iron Curtain" can be lifted, or whether it will deepen further, will be known within a few days. Well-informed sources have recently said that the British government is holding talks with the Soviet Union in London, while also conducting negotiations with the United States in Berlin, hoping to improve the current situation. Britain now has two paths to follow: one is to strive to establish a closer relationship with the Soviet Union, and the other is to stand in opposition to the Soviet Union and divide Germany in two, thereby dividing Europe and even the entire world. Regarding this matter, the British Minister of Commerce, Cripps, is currently in London negotiating with the Soviet representative, Kransov, preparing to establish a commercial agreement as a basis for clarifying the general relationship between the two sides. In addition, British representatives are also in Berlin holding talks with the US side, hoping to prepare for the economic unification of Germany in the British, American, and French occupation zones. If the Soviet Union does not fully agree, it will be implemented regardless of Soviet objections. The above two talks are taking place in secret, but according to reliable sources, since last year, commercial relations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been interrupted due to the Soviet side's refusal to allow the import of British goods. These goods are worth about 11 million pounds and are ready for shipment. As of the end of April this year, about 140 British manufacturers, including the automobile and textile industries, have suggested to the British Ministry of Commerce and Supply that they plan to restore commerce with the Soviet Union and grant the Soviet Union a 50 million pound credit loan for a term of ten years. The talks currently underway in London are based on this suggestion. However, the Soviet side believes that the value of the various goods is too high and has not agreed to accept them. Fortunately, the Soviet Union has transported a large number of gold bars into Britain, which may serve as a guarantee for the ten-year credit loan. As for the talks being conducted by British and American experts in Berlin, their primary goal is to separate the eastern and western parts of Germany. The main points are: (1) The UK and the US should make full use of all assets in their occupation zones and should not import goods from the Soviet Union; (2) The UK and the US subcommittees should formulate plans for their respective occupation zones to encourage production and determine prices; (3) If the UK and the US are unable to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, they should mutually agree on price levels and use the Mark as an exchange tool; (4) When the talks reach the final stage, France should be invited to participate. To this end, well-informed sources concluded that the talks currently underway in London are quite optimistic and seem to want to establish a reasonable agreement. The talks being conducted in Berlin, on the other hand, could separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe. Their nature is completely different.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Atomic Bomb Test Exercise; Explodes Fifty Minutes Earlier Than Scheduled; Power Equivalent to 400,000 Depth Charges <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Broadcast): During the atomic bomb exercise held on Bikini Atoll today, the dummy bomb, a magnesium flash bomb, exploded suddenly fifty-one minutes before the scheduled time. Although the premature explosion and bad weather forced most of the aircraft to return to base, another dummy bomb exploded at the specified time, and the exercise was not disrupted. According to Blandy, the cause of the premature explosion is unknown. According to the explanation of staff officers, it was caused by an error in the electrical circuitry, and it suddenly exploded at 8:14 AM. Blandy said that the premature explosion has little to do with the actual atomic bomb test, because the electrical circuit for initiating the bomb was not adequately protected. He also said that when conducting the real underwater atomic bomb explosion, the accuracy of the explosion time is guaranteed. When the magnesium flash bomb exploded, a violent shock occurred in the air above, and forty-seven aircraft participating in the exercise were forced to retreat, leaving only nine to observe the weather.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency Reporter Song Dehe aboard the USS Appalachian en route to Bikini, 18th] The second atomic bomb test at Bikini, as far as the reporter is concerned, will be more spectacular and more dramatic than the one held on July 1st. According to the current plan, when the atomic bomb is tested on the 25th of this month, the reporter will be able to observe it from a closer location. This explosion is expected to inflict greater damage on the target ships. US Navy officials today told reporters that this second atomic bomb test will be an underwater explosion. It is estimated that its impact on the ships will be four times stronger than the previous air explosion. According to their rough estimate, the atomic bomb exploded on that day will be equivalent to 400,000 depth charges. It is understood that the test bomb will be placed between 18 feet below the surface of the water and the bottom of the lagoon (about 120 feet). This fifth atomic bomb placed underwater will be like an underwater-controlled mine.</p>
<p>[United Press dispatch from the USS Appalachian, the viewing ship for the atomic bomb test, 18th] On the 25th of this month, its mechanism is based on the speed of sound. This speed is about every five seconds in the air; but in the lagoon it is about two miles per second. Vibrations in the water and lagoon travel at the same extraordinary speed as the explosion. The bomb's entire atomic energy enters the water, and just as an aerial explosion dissipates into the air, the Bikini coral reef may suffer a catastrophe. But not all of the atomic energy enters the Bikini water. The exact proportion is a military secret and a point of contention among scientists. These vibrations are expected to touch the bottom of the Bikini coral reef.</p>
<p>The Soviets Send More Personnel to Observe the Test</p>
<p>[United Press reporter's special dispatch from a ship en route to Bikini] In addition to the two scientists previously designated, the Soviet Union has added one more person, Lieutenant Commander Kokarov, as a "news representative" to observe the underwater explosion test of the atomic bomb at Bikini. With the exception of the United Kingdom, all other invited countries have sent two people. China has also sent two scientists to participate.</p>

<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi declared today that Italy had lost 600,000 people in defending Trieste during World War II. If the port is placed under international trusteeship according to the decision of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the new Italian Republic will collapse. Italy hopes that the future Paris Peace Conference will reject the international trusteeship plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] The nationwide labor unrest in Italy continued to spread today. The Prime Minister believes that the development of the petroleum workers' strike has become a national emergency and has ordered the military and police to stop it. At the same time, the general strike in Turin began yesterday and has spread to public utilities.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The Foreign Office announced today that Britain has protested to the Soviet Union over its excessive interference in Hungary's internal affairs. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, the Soviet Union has requested the Hungarian government to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice and to cancel the privileges of three anti-Soviet parliamentarians.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The Army Department announced today that five union leaders, some of whom are physicists and chemists, have been fired from the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland for national security reasons. This move proves that rocket missiles and other new weapons are being manufactured at the plant. According to the department's news office, one of the five employees is a woman and has been fired. This is still in accordance with the Army National Defense Regulations. Of the approximately two million employees hired by the Army during the war, only dozens have been fired for violating these regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Cripps Reports on His Mission to India in the British House of Commons; He Met with Representatives of Various Indian Factions with Sincerity; Helping Them Narrow Their Differences and Complete the Constitution as Soon as Possible <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Cripps, one of the British cabinet representatives to India, recently stated in the House of Commons that the situation of this cabinet delegation to India was very different from when he was ordered to go to India in 1942. He said that the whole world is now politically aware, and so are the people of India. The House of Commons should know that the situation in the spring of 1946 is very different from that in 1942 or 1939. India is now deeply politically aware after the war, and the pressure that could be applied before the war is no longer appropriate. The steadfastness of delegation leader Lawrence in handling negotiations in India is commendable and has led to the current outcome. Some people criticize our talks as a waste of time, but in fact, this is very valuable to our mission. Contacting the various factions of 400 million Indians is very helpful in determining the direction of negotiations. We are not overly optimistic about the agreement reached at the round table conference held by the delegation with the Muslim League and the Congress Party in Simla. In Simla, we failed to bring them closer, and the meeting ended after two weeks. We returned to New Delhi and announced our views. We did indeed make every effort in Simla to generate a plan suitable for negotiation, so that we were able to issue a statement on May 16 after returning to New Delhi. Although we failed to announce a plan to prove our identity as the Indians had hoped, the purpose of our trip was not to implement a plan on India, but to help the Indians reach an agreement among themselves. We do not want to interfere in the organization of India's future constitution, but want to invite representatives of various factions in India to organize a constitutional assembly to discuss major plans together, because this is entirely a matter for the Indians themselves. Therefore, our basic policy is only to make suggestions to enable Indians to reach an agreement themselves and organize a constitutional assembly. That is why. This suggestion has been highly praised by all parties. Before we left India, representatives of all parties expressed their desire to promote the work of the constitutional assembly and provided suggestions on how to make it work, but it must be based on the conditions of the May 16 statement in order not to harm the interests of other relevant parties.</p>

<p>Truman Says Not Being Considered</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] President Truman said at a press conference today that the government will not ask Congress to allocate funds for loans to foreign countries. When Congress meets next time, the case of increasing the capital of the Export-Import Bank by 1.25 billion will be automatically brought up for discussion, but I approve the Treasury Department's allocation of 100 million to the Philippines to help the country start rebuilding commerce. When asked about the possibility of the US granting loans to the Soviet Union, the President replied that, to my knowledge, any plans for such loans have not been considered.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] After French former Prime Minister Daladier was elected as a deputy to the Constituent Assembly, the Communist Party raised an objection, saying that his election should be invalid. Daladier immediately replied at length, involving many contradictions in the Communist Party and the use of French foreign policy at that time. He said, "Some say that I am a Munich traitor who offered France to Hitler. In fact, France was ready to help Czechoslovakia in April 1938. At that time, the Soviet Union was not trusted by Czechoslovakia, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain and the government took a reserved attitude and did not believe that Hitler had any malice towards Czechoslovakia, which was contrary to what France saw. Without large-scale aid from Britain, France was unable to fight Germany. After the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union were openly negotiating, the Soviet Union secretly negotiated with Germany and established a non-aggression pact. According to the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, this move by the Soviet Union was decided in April 1938.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing (Concluded)</p>
<p>Hall, Lincoln's predecessor as postmaster, came from New Jersey. After resigning from the post office, he built a "two-story" wooden house and set up a small store selling various groceries. It is said that Hall was a rather "important" figure in New Salem Village at the time. After Lincoln resigned as postmaster, he followed Hall's path and opened a "Lincoln Grocery Store." The Lincoln Grocery Store was built under a large locust tree and was the last of the dozen or so humble houses in the village to be built. In front of the door was a dirt road, and presumably muddy and slippery on rainy days, Lincoln paved a few scattered stones, but the stones were very smooth. I worry that Lincoln must have fallen on rainy days.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Grocery Store contains various simple daily necessities from the United States a hundred years ago, as well as woodwork made by Lincoln himself. Opposite the grocery store is Lincoln's home. Lincoln married and had children in the village in 1842, which can be seen in Lincoln's letters. One of Lincoln's children died young in that village. In Lincoln's so-called "home," there is a "grandfather clock," a kitchen, and a very simple fireplace for heating in winter. There are also several double-decker beds, which every family in the village has. The tour guide said: Parents sleep on the upper bunk, and babies sleep on the lower bunk. There were two doctors in the village, and the doctor's house was slightly more "spacious." Later, after Lincoln was elected president, the doctor moved away from the village. The United States is a very young country, but the people of the young country also "yearn for the past." Their enthusiasm for yearning for the past is admirable, and they want to maintain the "realism" of the objects, which is rare in other countries. Only one house in the entire village is modern, and that is the Lincoln Memorial Museum. The museum displays letters that Lincoln sent to his family elders, written from the White House after Lincoln was elected president. The letters contain many words of nostalgia for that small village. In addition, there are weapons used by the assassin who murdered President Lincoln, and digging tools and hammers used by traitors who later attempted to steal Lincoln's body. Also on display is the piano used by Lincoln at his wedding, as well as books with Lincoln's handwritten annotations. Lincoln lived in New Salem Village for six years before moving to Springfield. That was after Lincoln's marriage. There is a so-called Lincoln Home in Springfield, which is the second noteworthy place I want to talk about. It is a modern Western-style house, not far from the current Illinois State Capitol. It is now managed by the state government as a park, surrounded by white walls. Lincoln's house is on a street corner, bordering roads on both sides. The house has two floors, and there is a very small garden in the back. The house is white, and the window sills are green. There are five rooms inside. The upstairs is not open to the public. There is a government administrator downstairs. Visitors must write down their names and resumes before entering. The first room is a parlor, with an old sofa. The administrator said: That was Mrs. Lincoln's sitting room. Although old, it is incomparable to the humble farmhouses in New Salem Village. In Lincoln's study, there is a Mobil kerosene lamp, oil paintings and vases, an old-fashioned fireplace, a child's seat, and the silk that Lincoln once used. Lincoln lived in this house for seventeen years (1844-1861), so it is called "Lincoln's Home." On the door of the house, there are two bronze plaques. One says "Lincoln's Home," and the other contains a poem by Vachel Lindsay, describing Lincoln's tall, thin figure, how he entered and exited this house, and describing a large group of children playing in front of the door. This poem is very famous in the United States, excerpted from Lindsay's "Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight." The Illinois government has grand notices in New Salem Village and the "Lincoln's Home" in the city, preserving the antique charm, and inserting large American flags. The number of stars on the flag is different, representing how many states the United States had at that time. After seeing the Lincoln Home, it seems like we have returned to after 1861. Lincoln was elected president, and the North-South war broke out to liberate black slaves. After four years of fighting, Lincoln succeeded and died. Lincoln was assassinated by rebel forces in 1865 and transported back to Springfield for burial. Lincoln's physical body died, but Lincoln's spirit lives on forever! No one does not admire Lincoln's greatness, especially after you visit Lincoln's tomb. The tomb's architecture is very simple and solemn, all made of granite. The burial chamber is under the granite. Visitors can enter after signing their names. On the walls of the burial chamber are Lincoln's writings, proclamations, and the most famous Gettysburg Address of November 19, 1863. In the center of the burial chamber is Lincoln's coffin, on which is written "Now he belongs to the ages." On the stone wall in front of the burial chamber are engraved the names of Lincoln's family and their dates of birth and death. The cemetery is near the suburbs of Springfield. From afar, you can see large lawns, green shade, and the tall granite tomb tower. The names of the forty-eight states are engraved around the tomb tower, and bronze statues are installed at the four corners, all in the uniforms of soldiers from the North-South War era; infantry, artillery, and other unnamed martyrs, these people followed President Lincoln and laid the national foundation for the United States. A large bronze statue of President Lincoln stands in front of the tomb. Every day, many American men and women come from all directions to pay their respects to Lincoln, the most outstanding figure of their history. The Lincoln Cemetery is also a public cemetery. All around are filled tombs, which are the American people who have died. Lincoln's impression on the American people is profound. Without Lincoln, the unification of the United States would not have been established so completely; without Lincoln, the industrialization of the United States might have been delayed for decades. The Civil War was not Lincoln's goal. Lincoln's contribution to the United States was a strong unified state, and accelerated industrialization. These two magic weapons were precisely the important factors that the United States later used to defeat Spain, defeat Germany twice, and defeat Japan once. Lincoln laid an unshakeable foundation for the United States' current position as a world leader. Who says President Lincoln has died? Lincoln is living forever!

<h3 id="e49">He DeKui Responds to the Case of Senator Wu Yifang's Accusation: Asks Himself if His Actions Are Upright and Open, Regarding His Relationship with the Enemy and Puppets <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] When the Standing Committee of the National Senate of Nanjing held its regular meeting yesterday morning, Standing Committee Member Ms. Wu Yifang (President of Jinling Women's University) accused He DeKui, the current Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, of being a suspected traitor, and said that she had photos as evidence. All sectors of the city were shocked upon hearing the news. At 5 p.m. yesterday, reporters from various newspapers went to the municipal government to interview Secretary-General He DeKui. At that time, He had just returned from the review meeting of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He immediately received the reporters in the conference room of the municipal government. He, wearing a white summer cloth long shirt and holding a black paper fan, was very calm. He smiled and told the reporters: Regarding the transmission of this unexpected news, I would like to state three facts: (1) After the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 8, 1941, the British and American General Manager, directors, director-general, head of the finance department, and staff of all ranks of the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to serve in the Municipal Council in accordance with the intentions of the US authorities. Therefore, I should also continue to serve. (2) I served in the Municipal Council with the British and Americans. The Japanese enemy did not appoint the retained British and Americans, nor did they appoint DeKui and others, because the Municipal Council was an international organization. (3) Later, rumors spread that the puppet regime in Nanjing was going to take over the Shanghai Municipal Council. I immediately resigned. Therefore, when the traitor Chen Gongbo came to take over, I had already left. At that time, the enemy and puppets tried their best to win me over, but I refused them all. Therefore, my actions were upright and open. I would also like to state that I have never belonged to any party or faction. During the Shanghai Municipal Council era, on June 1, 1932, I was recommended by the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council to serve as a co-manager. After six years, I was promoted to deputy director-general, also for nearly six years. During the period of the city's occupation, I only served as a consultant to Chinese commercial and industrial circles, such as banks and spinning mills, to earn a living. After the restoration, I served as the chairman of the Committee for the United Allied Forces Reception of Compatriots in Concentration Camps of the Three People's Principles Youth League, as well as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Management Committee, deputy director of the Housing Rental Management Committee, and deputy mayor of Shanghai. Later, the deputy mayor system was abolished, so I was renamed Secretary-General. For more than ten years, I have been dedicated to my duty, law-abiding, and clean, without any hypocrisy. However, I may occasionally offend people due to official duties, but all of them are for the public good, without any personal prejudice.</p>
<p>He then told the reporters about the joke made by the square weekly "Jeep," saying that a few months ago, "Jeep" published a news item that "Deputy Mayor He tried his best to protect Ding Jiwan." For a while, rumors abounded, and some people even reported to Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan. In fact, there was no basis at all, and the publication immediately published a correction in the next issue after the incident. The unfounded rumors also broke down on their own. Therefore, he said that he did not take the news of being accused of being a suspected traitor very seriously, and said that it could be verified by the facts.</p>
<p>He also said: He and Wu Yifang were not familiar with each other. Before August 13, they met once on a ship, and he had a very good impression of her, and he believed that Wu Yifang would not have any ill feelings towards him. This accusation was probably instigated by others. As for the report that there were photos as evidence, he had no idea and could not guess. During the occupation period, he maintained contact with the central government all along. Yu Bingjian, the current director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, knew very well about the patriotic work he did. Moreover, he had never left Shanghai for more than ten years. His every move was known to Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai, so there was no need to repeat them.</p>
<p>According to reports, He is from Jinhua, Zhejiang Province. He studied at Peking University and was at the top of his class. In 1917, he was sent to the United States for further study, ranking first in the Ministry of Education's examination. In 1919, he obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin, and in 1921, he obtained a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University. After returning to China, he served as a professor at Shanghai Datong University and Nanyang University, director of the business department of Guanghua University, and English secretary of the Economic Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association. He studied the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. Therefore, the board of directors of the Municipal Council decided to unanimously approve his appointment as co-manager. He's involvement in commercial and industrial circles began after the occupation. During that time, he once assisted the Xinwen Bao newspaper in handling student loans for the poor. Later, he heard that the traitor Chen Riping was going to join the Xinwen Bao, so he immediately resigned.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Zhang Zhiben Talks About Investigation and Reception Work: Welcomes the People's Secret Reports but Requires Listing Facts - Those Who Violate the Law and Neglect Their Duties Will Be Dealt with Impartially <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, the head of the Investigation Team for the Reception Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. Yesterday, he received reporters from the Central News Agency at his private residence and said: This team is composed of the Central Supervisory Committee, the Control Yuan, and the National Senate. In order to facilitate the investigation work, it is now divided into three groups: Shanghai-Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Anhui. The Beijing-Shanghai group is responsible for me and Cheng Zhongxing, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Wangji, and Secretary Xu Longchuan. Cheng and Fan are both in Shanghai. Wu and Xu will also come here in a few days and can start work. The location of the team's office has been temporarily decided to be at the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office. The working period is set at fifty days. The Shanghai reception work began in August of last year. It has been a year in the blink of an eye. To investigate the reception work of one year in fifty days, the time is very tight. In addition, the enemy and puppet property reception work in the Shanghai area is the most complicated. Therefore, we must take the most economical and effective steps to actively handle it. We hope that the city's party and government agencies, mass organizations, and the press will contact this team to assist in the investigation and provide specific materials for this team to refer to. At the same time, this team hopes to have not only a "radio receiver" but also a "radio transmitter" so that it can publicize the materials to the people of the country at any time after the investigation work begins. This point really depends on the assistance of the press. When reporters asked Zhang whether he accepted the people's "secret reports," he said: "Secret reports" are naturally very good, but the "secret reporters" need to have a responsible spirit. It is said that in the past, the city set up secret report boxes. Among the "secret report" letters received, there were actually names such as "People from the Southeast, Northwest, East, and West" and "A Member of the Nation," and the content of the secret reports often attacked individuals and could not provide correct evidence, which would inevitably lose the meaning of "secret reports." In the future, if there are secret report letters that list the facts and are responsibly signed, this team will welcome them very much.</p>
<p>Talking about the past reception of enemy and puppet property in Shanghai, Zhang said, "I have indeed heard some rumors, and there are many accusations about 'receiving materials' and 'losing people's hearts.' It is also said that there are some edible and usable materials in the warehouse that are being watched to rot without being processed. They only know how to 'receive materials' but do not know how to 'use materials.' All of these are manifestations of dereliction of duty. This team will thoroughly investigate them. If there are situations of abusing power, violating the law, neglecting duties, or being negligent in handling, as long as there is correct proof, this team will deal with them impartially, just like a judge trying a case. If the plaintiff submits evidence, the judge can make a judgment based on the articles of law, without any difficulty."</p>
<p>Regarding how to eliminate corruption, Zhang said: "Corruption is naturally a bad phenomenon, but on the one hand, we shout loudly that 'civil servants cannot live,' and on the other hand, we say that 'civil servants are corrupt,' which is somewhat contradictory. I think that corrupt people are ultimately a minority. We cannot universally apply this kind of 'shameful name' to civil servants, so that those who cherish their own reputation will also have a sense of black and white being difficult to distinguish, leading to a general psychology of 'good people do not become civil servants' and 'civil servants must be corrupt.' It must be known that the country has its own laws to punish those who are truly corrupt and neglect their duties. Just submit the evidence, and the government will punish them immediately. We should not make general accusations, which will only cause suspicion among foreign friends. We must correct this kind of concept. As for the improvement of the treatment of civil servants, it is also an urgent task at hand."</p>
<h3 id="e51">Mobilizing Northern Jiangsu Refugees to Clear Accumulated Garbage <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the Health Bureau started the second expanded epidemic prevention campaign on the 18th, according to statistics, more than 1.53 million people have been vaccinated. The Epidemic Prevention Committee, in view of the fact that there are many cholera patients in the Pudong area and it is difficult to provide relief, is now accommodating and treating them at the Municipal Third Hospital on Dongchang Road, which has 30 beds. In the Xujiahui area, factories and shops voluntarily donated materials to set up the Xuhui Temporary Epidemic Hospital, which has 25 beds and is completely free of charge. The Epidemic Prevention Committee, in order to promote environmental hygiene and hope to directly reduce the epidemic, has set up a cleaning zone system, clearing accumulated garbage in phases, and using 150 northern Jiangsu refugees and more than 300 vagrants from the Caohejing Work-Study Institute. They gathered at 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning and set off with the original cleaning team, and formulated a citizen's cleaning agreement, asking various districts and guarantees to persuade citizens to pay attention to it together.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 61 people were infected with cholera and 3 died. Including the previous cases, there are a total of 2,361 people infected and 170 deaths.</p>
<p>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds</p>
<p>At this time of rampant epidemics, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has exhausted the 20 million yuan it previously raised. The hospital's directors Liu Hongsheng and Zhu Zikui and others have initiated a broadcast fundraising preparation committee, and invited reporters to the Lake Society. Wang Xiaolai, Deng Qingshan, Dou Yaoting, Huang Zhensheng, Wang Yunkang, Bao Xiaodie, Tang Baoqi, and committee members Gong Zhaoxiong, Lu Jiying, Xu Jingyong, Zhou Yixing, Yan Xiaofang, Lu Jinrong, and others attended. According to Dou Yaoting, the hospital has been in operation for 29 years, with a long history, and has always taken serving society and helping the poor and sick as its mission. During the epidemic season of summer and autumn every year, it suspends the diagnosis of ordinary diseases and specializes in treating cholera, dysentery, and other epidemic diseases, day and night, regardless of the poor or the rich, providing diagnosis and medicine free of charge. For poor patients who need to be hospitalized for medical treatment, the required medicine and meals are also free of charge, and the number of free beds is expanded as much as possible to accommodate the poor and sick. In addition to the special, first-class, and second-class wards that charge fees, 100 third-class beds and outpatient medicine are completely free. Now, the cost of medicine is high, and all expenses require 3 million yuan per day. In order to raise funds to provide relief, from the 25th and 26th of this month, they will perform Peking Opera on the Jiancheng Radio Station (call sign XGSH, frequency 840) from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and on the 27th, they will broadcast comic Shanghai Opera and Yue Opera on the Minsheng Radio Station (call sign XPOC, frequency 1040), and on the 28th, they will broadcast on the Jianshe Radio Station (call sign XACS, frequency 940) from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be generous in donating money to benefit the patients, so that not only can the epidemic be curbed, but society can also avoid the danger of spreading. It was submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for discussion and approval, and then submitted to the Standing Committee, the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the two financial and economic departments for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>Treat the Symptoms Urgently, Do Not Pursue Lofty Goals</p>
<p>According to convener Luo Qinghua, the six-person group summarized opinions from all parties and focused on the current economic crisis. Based on the principle of treating the symptoms urgently, they made practical arguments without pursuing lofty goals. As for the basic economic plan, the economic policies of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the most noble and progressive guidelines of the near century, and Chairman Chiang's book "The Destiny of China" has extremely detailed enlightenment. It is heard that the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Central Design Bureau have also formulated various specific plans such as China's five-year industrialization plan, and the plans are already very beautiful. We only need to wait for the government departments in charge to earnestly follow and implement them, without further discussion. This time, the committee's research on emergency rescue plans was very cautious. The colleagues all deeply understand the government's current difficult situation and dare not make excessive demands or extravagant hopes. Therefore, the content of the plan is humble and without lofty arguments. All the points mentioned are what the government can and should do. They all believe that the prerequisite problem is that the government's current financial policy must be re-recognized, and the entire economic policy and financial measures must be thoroughly reformed with the greatest determination. All sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce must unanimously support the policies, try to overcome the difficulties, and rebuild the economic foundation.</p>
<p>The Last Moment, Rise Up Together</p>
<p>The current moment is the most critical period, but it is also the last opportunity. It is hoped that the government and the people will rise up together, seize this last opportunity, and not procrastinate or delay. Otherwise, the opportunity will be fleeting. Once the economy collapses, the country and the nation will be doomed, and no one under the overturned nest will be spared.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the 17th, at noon, Zhu Changhua, police officer No. 1662 of the Hongkou Police Bureau, was patrolling through the shantytowns in Shunxing Lane, Qiujiang Road, when he discovered Xu Jinwen and Tan Bingrong smoking morphine. He also found five small bags of morphine in Xu's pocket, so he took them to the bureau for interrogation. According to their confession, the drugs were purchased from Koreans Wu Quan and Zheng Yizhe, whose location was in Room 32, Taifu Lane, Qiujiang Branch Road. The section member Jiang Tianfu, led by police chief Xu Daren, police officers Li Chunhe, Zhu Changhua, and Yang Weiguang, went to the address. They found a bag of morphine weighing about five maces and two scales in the quilt. Wu and Zheng were arrested on the spot. After questioning, they initially denied it, but after several hours of preliminary interrogation, they finally told the truth. They confessed that there was also a large trafficker, Korean Hong Qishan, living in the pavilion room at No. 12, Lane 173, Qiujiang Road. The original handler rushed to break in at midnight. At that time, Hong was out and his wife was home. He was allowed to search the room, and as a result, 38 small bags of morphine, a large bag weighing five maces, a bag of white powder, a bag of lime, and a bag of fragrant powder were found in a small closet. They were all taken to the bureau for filing. The fugitive Hong Qishan is still being hunted down.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The eight warships gifted to us by the United States, carrying several hundred Chinese naval officers and soldiers who received training in the U.S., arrived at Wusongkou at dawn yesterday. Reporters and others rushed to the Coastal Defense Command Post of the Taiwan Garrison at Wusongkou at dawn. Together with Director Guo, Staff Officer Tang, Battalion Commander Qiu, and others, they boarded a small motorboat to welcome the Chinese naval officers and soldiers who had returned triumphantly after completing their studies, as well as the new-style warships gifted to us by our friendly nation (two new escort destroyers, four mine-laying and mine-sweeping ships, and two anti-submarine ships). The reporters and others boarded two boats separately, skimming across the vast expanse of sea and sky, and circled around the eight warships for inspection. The young men on board waved and cheered, also using signal lamps to greet the welcomers. They gazed at Shanghai, which they had been away from for nearly nine years, filled with boundless joy. Subsequently, naval officers stationed in Shanghai boarded the Taikang warship, and the reporters followed suit, but were immediately refused entry. It was said that this was an order from the local naval office. The reporters requested to stay a little longer for an exterior inspection, but were sternly refused, and had no choice but to disembark.</p>
<p>Soldiers Aboard Eager to Read Shanghai Newspapers</p>
<p>At this time, the returning soldiers on board still expressed their passionate enthusiasm, eagerly reading the newspapers that the reporters brought aboard. They said, "It's been a long time since we've read newspapers from our homeland." Xu Heng, a famous swimmer, is currently the captain of the Yongning warship. He disembarked yesterday to talk with reporters. Mr. Xu's spirit remains strong, and he is extremely interested in rebuilding our nation's new navy. He earnestly hopes that the domestic press will do more to promote the understanding and interest of the Chinese people in the navy. He told the reporter: "After our training in Malta, we were originally prepared to participate in the War of Resistance, but the war ended earlier than expected, causing us to miss the opportunity. However, upon our return this time, we swept a mine in Tokyo Bay and the Pacific Ocean, as a token of our desire. After leaving the United States last August, we went to the U.S. naval base in Cuba (Guantanamo) for sea trials and exercises. The famous Missouri and Roosevelt warships often participated in the exercises together. We stayed there for a total of three months. Until October 6th of last year, we again visited overseas Chinese in San Diego on the west coast of the United States. Their enthusiasm truly made us feel ashamed! Later, we also visited the local situations in Zhanba and Mexico City, and were inspected by their authorities. Then we went back to the west coast of the United States to repair the ships, and then transferred to Pearl Harbor to load supplies, passing through Honolulu, Midway Island, and other places before heading to Japan. We stayed in Yokosuka for three days before returning to Shanghai."</p>
<p>The eight warships were lined up in a straight line outside Wusongkou. When the reporters were inspecting them, the warships slowly advanced, with a gentle breeze and slight waves, stretching out endlessly. Lieutenant Colonel Lin Yun also accepted the reporter's photography on the warship. It is reported that Mr. Lin will lead the fleet to Nanjing at 4:00 AM this morning, and will return to Shanghai around the 24th.</p>
<p>Loading Supplies: Sumptuous Menu</p>
<p>The eight warships passed through Shanghai this time to follow orders and load supplies. Reporters learned the statistical figures of the supplies as follows: 3,000 catties of beef, 3,000 catties of pork, 5,000 catties of white rice, 550 eggs, 3,000 catties of bananas, 5,000 oranges, 3,000 lemons, 3,000 catties of watermelons, 5,000 catties of cabbage, 2,000 onions, 2,000 catties of tomatoes, 5,000 catties of potatoes, 5,000 catties of beans, 400 fish, 1,000 catties of green onions, and 3,000 catties of cucumbers. These supplies are prepared for use during their stay in Nanjing. It is said that during their training in the United States, all supplies were the same as those of the U.S. military. As for living allowances, the soldiers received about 30 to 60 U.S. dollars per month. Future treatments have not been fully determined.</p>
<p>As for the number of officers on each warship, there are approximately eight officers and one hundred soldiers. They are all energetic and physically strong and will be the new force of the Chinese navy!</p>

<h3 id="e54">Rules for Managing Restaurants in This City Revised and Passed; Penalties for Tax Evasion and Banquet Levies Re-Established <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Municipal Council revised and passed 23 articles of the rules for managing restaurants in this city. The main points are as follows: (1) The scope of management includes hotels, Western restaurants, tea houses, Chinese-style wine shops for on-site consumption, beer for consumption inside and outside the premises, foreign liquor for off-site consumption, temporary bars, Western-style hotels, coffee rooms, noodle shops, dim sum shops, and places that sell food and beverages in public entertainment venues and hotels. (2) Anyone opening a restaurant must obtain a permit according to the procedures before opening. Those established before the promulgation of these rules should apply for the procedures within one month after the promulgation of these rules. (3) The permits are renewed once a year, and the permit will be revoked if the business has not started within one month of obtaining the permit. (4) Restaurants should have appropriate facilities for garbage disposal and drainage, wire mesh disinfection, and stoves should not be installed in the store. (5) Employees and shop assistants must undergo a physical examination once a year.</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau discovered that banquet hall merchants often conceal and evade tax payments when collecting taxes on behalf of the government. Those who are caught with account books will be required to pay the total amount of evaded taxes. However, often only a portion of the invoices can be seized. Upon reviewing the account books, it is found that the amounts are not recorded, which is obviously to evade taxes. If only the discovered tax-evading invoices are used, the amount is very small. Even if they are prosecuted, it is not enough to deter the stubborn. Yesterday, the Municipal Council decided to calculate the tax based on the number of days on which the evasion was discovered, and fine them accordingly. The standard for calculating the punishment will be based on the average turnover of the largest month to rectify the banquet tax revenue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to crack down on the unauthorized construction of sheds in the city, it was resolved that the police bureau should instruct each branch and police station to pay attention to outdoor patrols. Anyone constructing sheds without a license should be banned.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xue Gengxin, who was once prominent during the enemy-puppet period, originally served as a translator in the French Concession Police Department before the war. During the war, he was once promoted to Chief Inspector of the Political Department, and later transferred to the position of Chief of the Huangpu Branch of the Police Bureau. After the establishment of the puppet secret service headquarters, Xue served as the leader of the intelligence group in "76," using his special power to arrest and kill patriotic heroes on a large scale and hinder our underground work. After the victory, knowing that his crimes were monstrous, he hid in North China. After multi-faceted searches by the relevant authorities, he could not escape the law and was finally escorted to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning, under strict guard, he was escorted to the High Court in Tilanqiao. After the year, age, and origin were asked, he was ordered to be detained in the Zhongzi Jail. The High Procuratorate will open a court to investigate his crimes in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Yangshan, from Henan, is 45 years old this year. He was formerly a member of the Kuomintang, but later joined the puppet government. He successively served as Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Puppet Central Headquarters, Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Dedication Machine Movement Committee, Chief Supervisor of Training of the Puppet Youth League, and Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Party Department. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities and transferred to the court. He has been interrogated several times on record. Yesterday morning, the collegiate panel re-examined the case. Liu argued that he had led the "Youth League" to promote the "anti-gambling, anti-dancing, and anti-drug" movement, which dealt a significant blow to the enemy and puppet's poisoning policy. After the victory, he also assisted in the takeover matters, so he asked himself to contribute to the party and the country. The trial of the case concluded, and the court ordered the sentence to be pronounced at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>On the same day, the enemy collusion cases of Qian Xiaomin, acting director of the Wuxi Station of the Puppet Political Security Bureau, and two Italians, Kang Sidan Dingni and Qie Erxi Ai, were concluded, and it was decided that they would be sentenced on the morning of the 26th.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the vicinity of Zhoujiaqiao Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, two robbers robbed a hawker of more than 9,000 national currency, and headed north along Zhongshan Road towards Zhenru. After receiving the report, the Zhoujia Police Station of the Xinjing Police Bureau sent a patrol officer to pursue them. At the same time, sentries from the 435th Regiment of the National Army stationed in Zhenru assisted in the pursuit and arrest.

<h3 id="e61">Zhongyuan Shipping Company Sues Maersk for Breach of Contract in Purchasing a Ship and Demands Compensation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The first Sino-British international civil lawsuit was heard in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff in the case was Zhongyuan Shipping Company, and the defendant was the British merchant Maersk (i.e., Laisi Shipping Company). On November 28th of last year, Zhongyuan Shipping Company purchased the "Wenifu Lei Maersk" ship from the British merchant Maersk, stipulating that the ship would be delivered when it arrived in Shanghai, with a total price of 75,000 pounds. Unexpectedly, after paying in installments, the plaintiff suddenly received a notice from the defendant on March 8th of this year, requesting to terminate the contract and return the deposit of 52,000 pounds and interest of 25 pounds, 5 shillings, and 6 pence. Zhongyuan Company then requested the defendant to compensate for the losses suffered due to the failure to perform the contract in accordance with Article 260 of the Civil Code, amounting to 774,479,944 yuan in legal tender and 13,088 pounds in British currency. The defendant stated that the seller of the "Wenifu Lei Maersk" ship was originally British Maersk Co., Ltd., located in London. However, the plaintiff proved from the defendant's letters that the Maersk shipping companies in London and Shanghai were originally one company. Moreover, the contract stated that delivery was required upon the second payment. Although the defendant received the second payment, it did not deliver the ship but returned the payment, which shows the intention to terminate the contract. The defendant replied: Because the British Wartime Transportation Bureau issued a ban on the transfer of various means of transportation, the ship was not allowed to be sold. Regarding this point, the defendant was forced to do so and had sent a letter to the plaintiff stating this, so please reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff firmly believed that the contract stated that the delivery date was the second payment, so the sovereignty of the ship undoubtedly belonged to the plaintiff. Since the defendant had breached the contract, it was natural to request compensation for losses. At this point, the court ordered the debate to end, and the sentence was set for the morning of the 24th. If the defendant loses the case, the amount of compensation will be determined in due course.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Members of the Shanghai Warehousing Industry Association increased the warehouse rental fee by one time from June 1 this year due to the high expenses of each item, which is 160 yuan of national currency per cubic foot. Yesterday, the person in charge of the association told reporters: This regulation also varies slightly depending on the warehouse buildings and equipment of the members, but the highest fee may not exceed this book. Up to the month before, the association had registered about 70 members, with capital ranging from 500,000 yuan to tens of millions of yuan. However, due to the sharp increase in imported goods in the city, most of the warehouses are full, but the actual situation cannot compensate for the monthly losses. Because the enemy-puppet materials sealed and stored in the warehouses after the victory have not yet been processed by the authorities, and the monthly warehouse rental fee paid for these sealed materials is only 25 yuan of national currency per cubic foot, resulting in the recent inability of a few members to continue operating. Therefore, the association, from the standpoint of the industry, sincerely hopes that the authorities will consider the difficulties of the business, expedite the clearance of sealed materials, and reduce their responsibilities.</p>

<p>Under the direct jurisdiction of the Four Joint Offices, the Shanghai Salt Loan Syndicate, represented by the Bank of China, was officially established yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Bank of China Building, and a meeting was convened. Attendees included representatives from the Four Joint Branches, the four banks, the two bureaus, and various commercial banks and shops. Xu Weiming (China) was elected as the director, and Lu Tingkui (Transportation) as the deputy director. Zhou Jiyao (China Farmers), Zhong Long (China Trust Bureau), Shen Shuping (Postal Savings Bureau), Xu Guomao (Commercial Bank Representative), and Xu Wenqing (Money Shop Representative) were elected as members, and Jiang Jinren and Cen Lisan were hired as secretaries of the syndicate.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Liu Hongsheng, the executive director of the "Administration Headquarters", recently reorganized the agency, his authority has greatly increased. The most urgent task among his newly added tasks is to speed up the inland transportation of materials so that the director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration," La Guardia, can withdraw his order soon. The LST and LSM ships managed by China Merchants Bureau, totaling about 21,000 tons, will independently bear the transportation task. According to statistics from the "Administration Headquarters," if the ban is lifted and the quantity of materials coming to China remains unchanged, then 175,000 tons of ships per month will be needed for transportation, which is far from the total tonnage currently owned by China Merchants Bureau. Therefore, some related parties are not optimistic about whether the transportation tools will be sufficient in the future and whether La Guardia's ban can be lifted soon, because these ships must also send refugees in addition to transporting materials.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 19th] Peiping Normal College has decided to reinstate the graduate school, adding a department of education in addition to the existing departments of Chinese Studies and History.

<h3 id="e73">Yanjing University's Restoration to its Former Grandeur: Not Easily Achieved in the Short Term; Acting President Lu Zhigong Tells Reporter <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 19th] Yanjing University, which is reopening in Peiping, is currently facing financial difficulties. According to Acting President Lu Zhigong, who told a reporter: Yanjing University's funding relies heavily on American donations, but due to high inflation, one US dollar is currently worth less than thirty cents in pre-war Chinese currency, so the school's income only covers one-third of its expenses, with the remaining two-thirds needing to be found domestically. The engineering college that Yanjing University planned to add this year will remain merged with the science college due to financial difficulties, with engineering courses being added to the physics and chemistry departments. Most of the school's equipment was lost after the Pacific War and has yet to be recovered. The equipment currently in use is mostly borrowed from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. There is also a significant shortage of professors, especially in the Journalism and Economics departments, which have the largest number of students. Several American professors that Provost Stuart was planning to hire have been unable to come to China due to transportation and domestic order problems. The restoration of Yanjing University to its former grandeur will likely take one or two years to achieve.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The National Jiangsu Medical College, formerly the Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College, moved west in response to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. In 1938, it was ordered by the Ministry of Education to merge with the medical department of Nantong College and was reorganized as a national institution. In 1939, it moved to northern Sichuan. In 1941, it continued to run a senior nursing school, with one class already graduated. Since the year before last, it has also offered a medical specialization program and a health education specialization program. There are currently over 400 students. Hundreds of graduates serve in medical institutions in various provinces and cities. Fortunately, most of the college's buildings remained intact during the Anti-Japanese War, but the hospital was damaged and needs to be repaired. It is reported that 20 outpatient clinics have already been built, and the remaining classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, and affiliated hospitals will be actively repaired during the reconstruction period so that they can be used. The campus is located at the foot of Beigu Mountain in Zhenjiang, covering an area of over 180 acres. Classes are expected to begin in the fall after the complete reconstruction.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, in order to safeguard the opportunity for further education for graduates of schools above the specialization level during the period of occupation, has issued certificates temporarily allowing them to take the study abroad examination. It is now reported that the case has been submitted to the Ministry of Education and approved by instruction No. 7666 of the Liu character dated July 10. The text of the Zhu instruction is as follows: "It is noted that graduates of national, enemy puppet universities and enemy puppet independent colleges are temporarily allowed to apply for the exam with the review registration certificate, but after passing the examination, they must submit a review qualification certificate before they can receive a study abroad certificate. Graduates of enemy puppet vocational schools who have not served are not allowed to apply. Please take note." It was previously reported that graduates of enemy puppet schools above the specialization level who have not been reviewed may also apply for study abroad exams directly. This must have been a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="e87">The South China Football Team's Visit to Shanghai: Sports Association Issues Statement: Recounts the Welfare Foundation's Negotiation Process <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The City Sports Association yesterday issued a statement regarding Li Huitang leading the South China team to Shanghai at the invitation of the China Welfare Fund to participate in charity matches. The statement recounts the negotiation process between the Welfare Association and the City Sports Association as follows:</p>
<p>"On the 17th, various newspapers in this city published reports that Mr. Li Huitang was invited by the China Welfare Fund Committee to lead the South China Football Team to Shanghai to participate in charity football matches. In order to be cautious, the association deems it necessary to recount the negotiation process. In late June, a sports news report in a certain newspaper stated that Mrs. Sun had initiated the invitation to Mr. Li Huitang to lead the team to Shanghai to hold charity football matches, and the preparations were reported in the newspapers from time to time. On the 2nd of this month, the China Welfare Fund Committee sent a representative, Ms. Tan Liuqingxuan, with a letter to Zhou Jiaqi of the Football Committee, stating that they planned to hold charity football matches in mid-month in order to raise funds for disaster relief, and they had invited Mr. Li Huitang of the South China Football Team to preside over the matches. They requested assistance in inviting the participating teams, referees, and organizing the match schedule. Mr. Zhou Jiaqi replied with the reasons for holding the matches in late August, citing that the football season had ended and the various difficulties of holding them at an unsuitable time. On the 12th of this month, the Football Committee received a second letter from the China Welfare Fund Committee, which briefly stated: "Disaster relief is as urgent as putting out a fire. The South China team has decided to come to Shanghai and is preparing to depart. In order to alleviate the various difficulties of your association (Football Committee), the Welfare Foundation has contacted various teams and related parties and has been kindly promised support and assistance. Therefore, as soon as the South China team arrives in port in the coming days, our association will decide on the match date and ask for your guidance and full assistance." The Football Committee of the Sports Association, because this matter concerned the duties of the association, submitted it to the Council of Directors for discussion. At the meeting held at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month, the two letters sent by the China Welfare Fund Committee to the Football Committee regarding the proposed hosting of the South China football team's visit to Shanghai to participate in charity matches were submitted. The decision was made that: (1) According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Sports Competitions Organized by Municipal Mass Organizations established by this association, "Municipal mass organizations that wish to raise charitable funds by holding public competitions and issuing tickets must obtain prior approval from this association before publicly selling tickets." (2) The football season has passed. Based on the above two points, it is difficult to comply. The aforementioned decision was sent to the Welfare Foundation for their review on the 15th of this month. After Li Huitang and others arrived in Shanghai, the association also notified the South China Football Team of the resolution of the Council of Directors at noon on the 17th, and because the team members are all amateur athletes, the association hoped that they would respect the resolution of the association's Council of Directors. Fearing that various circles are not aware of the true situation of the negotiations, this is specially declared as above, in the hope that all parties will be aware."</p>

<p>The traffic between Wusong Town, which belongs to the jurisdiction of the 23rd District (Wusong) of this city, and Shanghai used to be maintained by the railway. Since the road was destroyed by the enemy, it has been cut off. After the victory, although local gentry and merchants have repeatedly appealed to the two road management express runs to restore the route, the bureau has been unable to realize it due to a lack of materials, and it is still blocked, causing inconvenience to merchants and travelers. Yin Gongtian, chairman of the District People's Congress of the district, and others, in view of the need to restore transportation in order to prosper the market, initiated the organization of the Wusong Transportation Promotion Association, and have negotiated with the Directorate General of Public Roads of the Ministry of Communications to sign a contract to dispatch a number of buses to run on the Wusong-Shanghai public bus line to maintain transportation. It will be stopped once the railway is restored. The district office has been asked to submit it to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District Appeals for Refugees <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The refugees from northern Jiangsu residing between Datong Road and Gonghe Road in the Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District of this city previously faced the imminent demolition of their thatched huts due to the Railway Bureau's road property reorganization, causing widespread fear. They jointly submitted a request for a delay last month. The Railway Bureau distributed a method requiring them to demolish the houses occupying road property themselves within one month. The refugees, still with nowhere to go, gathered at the local Bao office, requesting assistance in appealing to the Railway Bureau to convey their plight and postpone the demolition of the thatched huts. The Bao heads, Feng Dianbao and Xu Peixin, specially invited district representatives to draft a proposal, requesting the Railway Bureau to postpone the unconditional demolition for two years. They are currently awaiting a reply.</p>

<h3 id="e96">City Chamber of Commerce Petitions Government to Improve the Method of Returning Factories: Losses Borne by the People, Benefits Fully Enjoyed by the Nation <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a proposal from the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, intends to request the government to change the principles for taking over enemy and puppet assets. It sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan a few days ago. The full text is as follows: To the esteemed Executive Yuan of Nanjing, the Chamber of Commerce convened the ninth members' meeting on June 23. According to the proposal of the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, it is intended to request the government to change the principles for taking over enemy and puppet industries. The reasons stated within are: upon investigation, each factory in the recovered areas was forcibly seized by the enemy and puppet regimes, occupied for eight years. The factory buildings and machinery were occupied, and the raw materials and finished products were plundered. (Omission)</p>
<p>Heavy Losses Make Production Impossible</p>
<p>After the factories are taken over, resuming production requires painstaking management. Given the post-disaster situation, with a hundred holes and thousands of wounds, for the sake of economic recovery and promoting production, the government should provide assistance and encouragement to achieve the goal of national construction. However, it is heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau are handling the return of private factories based on the condition that only the undamaged machinery and equipment are returned. The raw materials, finished products, and materials stored in the factory when it was taken over must be nationalized. Even the factory buildings and equipment that were dismantled and transformed by the enemy must be considered as newly added or installed by the enemy, and the original owners must be charged for them.</p>
<p>Nominal Return, Only the Shell Remains</p>
<p>Under this situation, the nominal return of private factories only leaves the shell. Without newly adding raw materials and materials, it is impossible to start work and maintain production. (Omission) Logically speaking, the factory land and machinery and equipment are the mother of production. Because the enemy occupied private factories, the added raw materials, manufactured goods, and transformed equipment are all interdependent, like mother and child, and cannot be separated. In other words, the occupation of private factories is the cause, and the aforementioned products are the result. They should naturally be enjoyed by the original factory owners who were occupied, and should not be regarded as war trophies of the state. Among them, there are factories whose raw materials and finished products stored in the factory when they were occupied were also plundered by the enemy. If the current proposed method is followed, the losses will be borne by the people, and while it is nominally possible to claim compensation from Japan in the future, it is actually far off and amounts to quenching thirst with plums. The benefits will be enjoyed by the state, and a part of the people's losses will be divided as the state's exclusive benefit. Considering that the state and the people originally belong to one body, sharing weal and woe, this is completely contrary. It is proposed that the general assembly suggest that the government change the principles for handling the takeover of enemy and puppet properties.</p>
<p>Proper Method, Recommended for Implementation</p>
<p>All raw materials, materials, finished products, and newly added or transformed equipment taken over from occupied private factories should be handed over to the original factory for valuation and used to offset the losses caused by the enemy's occupation, seizure, and destruction. If there is any surplus, it can be nationalized and deposited in the treasury, but a reasonable deadline should be given for phased repayment to benefit recovery and production. (Omission) It is found that this case was previously forwarded to the National Political Council for a proposal. The Executive Yuan replied to the Secretariat of the National Political Council, stating that the Nationwide Enterprise Takeover Committee in the recovered areas had reviewed and decided that if the original telegram from the City Chamber of Commerce was followed, not only would the occupied factories that had already been processed by various administrations have to be re-liquidated, but the future work of clearing and claiming compensation from Japan would also be fragmented. It requested instructions on whether to approve the request, or to give each occupied factory the right to prioritize claims and compensation when handling compensation from Japan. The Executive Yuan rejected the matter based on the council's decision, and the Secretariat of the National Political Council forwarded the reply to the City Chamber of Commerce. The council's reply only focused on the difficulties in official procedures, and did not consider the points in the original telegram that "the occupation of private factories is the cause, and the aforementioned products are the result, they should naturally be enjoyed by the original factory owners who were occupied, and should not be regarded as war trophies of the state," and "the nominal return of private factories only leaves the shell," and "if the current proposed method is followed, the losses will be borne by the people."</p>
<p>Claims from Japan are Distant and Uncertain</p>
<p>"While it is nominally possible to claim compensation from Japan in the future, it is actually far off." In the council's reply, Item 445, these were not taken into account at all. It only knows how to plan from the perspective of public interest, which is not the position that a country should have, with the people as the basis. In accordance with the public opinion of the industry, a renewed request is made, hoping that the esteemed Executive Yuan will review, approve, and implement it. (Omission)</p>
<h3 id="e97">After the Diversion of Floating Capital, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Soar, Both Gold and Foreign Currencies Become Dull <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The gold market declined from stability yesterday, securities were active, floating capital shifted, and the gold market became dull again. From the morning's initial circling of 1.98 million, it fell. After 10 o'clock, the central government allocated 28 bars at a price of 1.9575 million, making it even harder to recover after entering the market. Major players were on the sidelines, and it fell to 1.94 million near noon. In the afternoon, it initially stabilized and then rose back to around 1.96 million. As a result, it closed down by 18,000 compared to the previous day. Gold ornaments of 10,000 were all sold. Informal short-term financing was flat, with interest rates ranging from 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>The US dollar was initially stable but trended flat. Initially, there were sales at 2540 yuan, and although a high price of 2560 yuan was seen after the opening, it soon declined due to the decline in the gold market. At noon, it retreated to within 2500 yuan. There was a slight rebound in the afternoon. As a result, it closed down slightly by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Due to reports of the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar rose slightly upon entering the market. It was slightly flat at noon, and the result was the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar was sold at 565 yuan, the Indian rupee at around 670 yuan, the British pound at 8900 yuan, and the US dollar was nominally flat but informally dull.</p>
<p>Government bonds remained stagnant. Both buyers and sellers were waiting for an opportunity. From an initial level of around 900 yuan in the morning, Tong Bing fell to around 800 yuan before slightly stabilizing. There were not many transactions. At noon, it hovered around 850 yuan. As a result, it closed down slightly compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi were the same. Tong Ding rose slightly, and Wu was flat. Chinese stocks presented a spectacular speculative scene. Before 11 o'clock, they were still in a flat state, but after 11 o'clock, a large amount of buying emerged. Major players rushed to cover their positions, and in half an hour, they rebounded by 15% to 20%, which was shocking. The speed of the change was unprecedented. The low prices in the morning were 570 yuan for Yongsha, 3800 yuan for Meiya, 255 yuan for Jingfu, 260 for Xinguang, and 195 yuan for Qinxing. The high prices near noon were 670 yuan for Yongsha, 4750 yuan for Meiya, 315 yuan for Jingfu, 310 yuan for Xinguang, and 235 yuan for Qinxing. In the second half of the time, Jingfu was again raised above Xinguang, with each showing its own abilities. As a result, Yongsha and Jingfu each rose by 15%, Meiya rose sharply by more than 20%, and Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by 10%. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks saw a 70% increase. Veteran stocks were stable. Bids after the close were initially low and then improved, with erratic pricing.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were flourishing, with the bullish trend starting earlier than Chinese stocks. Securities firms were actively involved, and the buying trend intensified. Yisha rose from 9200 yuan to 10,800 yuan, and Yinglian rose from 9500 yuan to 11,000 yuan. Other stocks were also affected and rose quite a bit. Steel and pharmaceuticals had strong buying interest and high bids. Near noon, it entered a consolidation phase. As a result, the steel industry rebounded by 20%, and Yisha, Yinglian, and Huidifeng each did well by 10%. The rest also rose by about 5%.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yarn Market Declines in a Straight Line, Cotton Prices Rise by 3,000 to 4,000 Yuan, Opening Prices for Textile Construction Also Increase <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined in a straight line. At the opening in the morning, selling pressure was strong. Traders from all over felt that the local yarn price was stagnant and could not rise sharply along with Shanghai, so they stopped buying. The decline was significant, with 20-count yarn falling by 30,000 to 80,000, and fine yarn also falling by 80,000. The number of transactions was extremely small, and sentiment turned weak. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual. The opening price for 20-count yarn was higher than Wednesday, because the yarn sold in the previous period was Lima, and the yarn sold in this period was Fengnian.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a New York American cotton telegram suddenly soared by 95 to 100 points per pound, with the recent price being US$35.65 and the forward price being US$35.82. The current price of Metring spot cotton also reached an unprecedented new high of US$36.25. The trading of current cotton in this city was still good. Shenxin First, Second, and Ninety-third factories all made purchases. In addition, Textile Construction and other factories had no transactions due to difficult negotiations. The market price was purely stimulated by the rise in American cotton, and rose by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>

<p>White tung oil is gradually stabilizing, and exports remain the same. Although there are rumors of price increases in the US market, the export sales in this city have not improved. However, domestic sales are slightly more active during the summer season. Wholesale sales in various industries are still at 76,000 to 77,000 yuan. The sales of Hongjiang tung oil are in full season, and there is a great need for it in various rural towns inland. Buyers from Shanghai are constantly arriving, resulting in a gradual improvement in the market. The current wholesale price for various brands of western deputy is 84,000 to 85,000 yuan at the highest, and 80,000 yuan at the lowest. The price for those manufactured in this factory is between 72,000 and 73,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] Recently, the supply of rice has become increasingly abundant, and market prices continue to fall. Yesterday, the lowest price for Wuhu Xian rice reached 48,000 yuan, and white japonica rice was only 63,000 yuan. The third batch of Jiangxi brown rice, totaling 11,630 bags, was distributed yesterday, but sales were sluggish.

<p>Refusing to Buy Brown Rice Means No Allocation of White Rice</p>
<p>It is heard that Mayor Wu instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to mark the household registration of citizens who buy brown rice. If good-quality white rice arrives later and is sold at a fair price, citizens who have purchased brown rice will have priority in purchasing white rice. If they have not purchased brown rice, they will not have the right to purchase white rice in the future. Regarding the sale of brown rice after milling it into white rice, the municipal government has not yet approved the request. It is heard that Mayor Wu solemnly stated that those who secretly mill brown rice into white rice for sale in the hope of making huge profits without approval will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<p>Arrivals are Abundant, Flour is Stable</p>
<p>The registration of rice arrivals at the north and south markets totaled 7,937.5 shi. Including the 1,424 shi transported and sold by the rice shops themselves, plus 114 bags, the total arrival of rice was 9,061 shi and 5 dou, mostly of medium and lower grades. High-grade rice was scarce, and the market trend was still to increase the price of rice husks. Shops picked up high-grade rice, and transactions of medium and lower grades were still ongoing. The flour market was temporarily stable, bran was stable, soybean sales were sluggish, and prices continued to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybeans were still scarce and there were few transactions.

Sesame was strong, and soybean cake sales were sluggish in rural areas. Shipments to other ports were halted, and prices fell by 300 to 400 yuan. Loose wheat remained slack among retail households, and prices were sluggish. Factory purchases remained unchanged, and oil prices were firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Allocated oil will continue to be distributed.</p>

<p>Upon investigation of the foreign tea market, after a period of silence among white-collar professionals, it suddenly revived yesterday. The Indian merchant Yulong Foreign Company launched an auction, purchasing about 800 boxes of Chenci Gongxi from Dadi Tea Factory at a price of 32,500 yuan per dan. The trend is still flat. According to news from the company, there is also a trend of increasing activity in Taiwan black tea in the coming days. As for the Wuyuan Chente Gong absorbed by the Tea Company in recent days, the inventory has remained unchanged. The market sentiment is firm and the future looks high. Domestic sales in shops and other places on the street continue to be strong. However, the supply of goods is also strong, which has kept the market price stable and prevented it from rising.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Report from Zhejiang Administrative Conference - Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Dispatch, 12th Day - Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Unfolding China's landmass, on the southeastern edge lies a peach-shaped area, smaller in area than any other piece of land; this is Zhejiang Province. The total area of Zhejiang Province is 153,968,424 *shi mu*. Although the area isn't large, it has 21,762,248 people. On average, each person has 7.7 *shi mu* of land. As Shen Honglie said, "Zhejiang is a healthy person. The people have a relatively high level of knowledge, and their lives are quite good." Indeed, Zhejiang's land is fertile, its agricultural products are abundant, and coupled with its geographical proximity to the sea, it produces many outstanding talents.</p>
<p>Warm Hometown: Zhejiang</p>
<p>In a healthy province, the male and female population statistics should not differ greatly. Zhejiang has 11,758,194 men and 10,004,054 women, a difference of just over a million. The proportions are not far apart. Due to the relatively similar male and female ratios, a simple and unadorned social custom prevails. There are few frivolous women and few shallow men. Moreover, the entire territory consists of arable land, with 37,790,697 *shi mu* of farmland and 100,912,934 *shi mu* of mountainous land. There are no barren, deforested mountains; instead, there are lush forests, providing resources for production. With just a little effort, one can obtain enough to be fed and clothed. The transportation within the province is also very developed, with 301,791 *shi mu* of roads and 3,578,653 *shi mu* of rivers and lakes. Besides trains and automobiles on land, there are various human-powered vehicles. Besides steamers and motorized boats on waterways, there are various boats of different sizes. Therefore, many people come to Zhejiang from afar, lingering in this warm hometown of abundant food and clothing.</p>
<p>Fallen into an Abyss of Suffering</p>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, the flames of war have spread throughout Zhejiang Province. Thirty counties fell into enemy hands, and nine were recovered. In the thirty-first year, twenty-two counties fell, and fifteen were recovered. In the thirty-second year, thirty-nine counties fell. After bloody struggles, twenty-nine counties were recovered. This repeated falling and recovery brought the entire production to a standstill. People fled their original posts, and coupled with the layers of exploitation by the enemy and puppet regimes, a beautiful Zhejiang was transformed into a tattered ruin riddled with holes. Eagerly awaiting the arrival of victory, the "selfishness" and "negligence" of the officials caused Zhejiang to fall into an abyss of suffering once again. The people of Zhejiang urgently long for good governance by officials more than anything else. Indeed, in the county seats of Zhejiang today, there are many dilapidated walls and ruins. In the countryside, there are many barren fields. The people cannot make a living, and those who resort to desperate measures are everywhere.</p>
<p>A Landmark Important Conference</p>
<p>Chairman Shen Honglie of Zhejiang, upon taking office, inspected the seawalls and urged their urgent repair. Then, he inspected various counties to learn about the people's suffering. Upon returning, he explained the importance of recovery. He revealed that this year's priorities were public security, followed by relief, and then transportation. Next year, he aimed to have each county effectively assume its responsibility for security, and each township to achieve the goal of education. He also broadly promoted water conservancy loans. At the same time, he believed that the current natural disasters were caused by the gradual deforestation, so he planned to focus on agricultural production in the western Zhejiang plains and on afforestation in the eastern Zhejiang mountains, dredging various rivers and streams to prevent a recurrence of future disasters. He also did not advocate empty talk, striving for practicality. This year, he would consolidate the generally good situation and then seek development, rather than focusing on immediate attractive figures and reports, but rather on practical content. Shen Honglie is indeed doing this, and doing it tirelessly. I interviewed the respected and upright Mr. Zhu Xianwen, the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly, who told me, "Chairman Shen can be considered diligent in his duties and loving to the people." We welcome a good official who is diligent in his duties and loves the people. Conversely, we oppose a "negligent" and "selfish" corrupt official. We want to see Mr. Shen continue to work actively. On the 20th of this month, Mr. Shen will convene a provincial administrative conference in Hangzhou, which can be considered a landmark and important conference in Zhejiang's politics. The past is gone; we wish to encourage those who come after!</p>
<p>Public Security, Officialdom, Relief</p>
<p>According to Chairman Shen's disclosure: Zhejiang Province prioritizes public security this year, because only after the public security problem is resolved can the people truly recover. This is indeed an enlightened view. However, this reporter believes that during the maintenance of public security, it is even more necessary to concurrently address the clarification of officialdom. Because if officialdom is not clarified, then in addition to visible bandits, there will still be invisible bandits. Invisible bandits can lead to visible bandits. Chairman Shen has declared that he will not use personal connections, and up to now, he has indeed not used any personal connections. We believe that Chairman Shen is determined to clarify officialdom. However, the prerequisite for clarifying officialdom is to improve the treatment of public officials. Currently, senior county-level officials receive only 50,000 yuan per month. How can they support a family? Regarding this, we hope that there will be a concrete resolution in this administrative conference.</p>
<p>Chairman Shen also revealed that another important goal this year is relief, such as solving the universal problems of food, clothing, and shelter in thousands of counties. If the problems of food, clothing, and shelter cannot be solved, all public security measures are empty. This is also a crucial plan. However, solving the problems of food, clothing, and shelter is indeed not an easy task. We hope that each district and county will have a concrete plan to submit for everyone to study. We know that this relief plan must first have money. Zhejiang Province is now truly in dire straits, with its finances stretched to the limit. Where will this huge sum of money come from? If each district and county has a meticulous plan, perhaps using work as relief, or intensifying production, there may be a chance of success. Therefore, we are willing to learn of feasible relief plans in this administrative conference.</p>
<p>Sluggish Export Products</p>
<p>This province was originally a society with abundant agricultural products. Geographically speaking, Zhejiang is not suitable for industry but suitable for agriculture. Its agricultural products, in addition to grains, wheat, and beans, also include tung oil and tea leaves, which are all major export products. These many export products are now on the verge of stagnation. How should they be improved? How should production be increased? How can people who produce these many products live and work in peace? This is indeed a very important issue at present. We know that these many products can also be industrialized, that is, the original agricultural products can be processed through industry and then sold abroad. However, these plans require people with great courage and foresight to implement them. We hope that each district and county will study these special products with past export achievements and provide concrete opinions, because the result of these exports is also to increase the wealth of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The administrative conference will be attended by more than 130 people, including provincial government members, department heads, district commissioners, county magistrates, and section chiefs and above from various departments and bureaus, for ten days. During these ten days, we believe that there will be very good resolutions, especially since Chairman Shen has provided appropriate suggestions in advance. Following these suggestions, there will definitely be good opinions. "Zhejiang is a healthy person," but now it is suffering from a serious typhoid fever.

<h3 id="e105">Anti-Treason Work in Hong Kong <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan, Hong Kong Dispatch, 13th Day of This Month</p>
<p>At the beginning of this article, the reporter would like to specifically explain the meaning of "traitor" (奸): Because the connotation of this word "traitor" may be different in Hong Kong and in the mainland. This difference is precisely the point of this article. In Hong Kong, the objects betrayed by a "traitor" are divided into (1) the Allied nations (including China and Britain), (2) Britain, and (3) China. The first type is called a "war criminal," the second is called an "enemy collaborator," and the third is called a "Han traitor" (漢奸) - the Han traitor referred to in our country's regulations for punishing Han traitors refers to this type. This article will also discuss the progress of the anti-traitor campaign in Hong Kong based on this distinction.</p>
<p>War Criminals on Trial</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the British Army Headquarters in Hong Kong, there are currently more than 200 war criminals imprisoned in Chi Ma Wan Prison. How does Hong Kong interpret "war criminal"? According to the chief prosecutor at the public trial of the first batch of war criminals by the Hong Kong Army Military Tribunal, international law stipulates that the most important actions of an occupier should be to respect the lives of the local people, not to disturb their peaceful lives, not to interfere with their religious beliefs, and not to threaten them with illegal or criminal charges. Anyone who fails to comply with these rules is in violation of the law and against the customs of war, and is regarded as the most important major war criminal. All the people belonging to this category are Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>From the public trial of the first batch of war criminals on March 28 to the present date of the draft, six batches have been tried, totaling 23 war criminals. Five were sentenced to death, and the rest were sentenced to imprisonment, ranging from eight years to as little as two years.</p>
<p>The public trial of war criminals is the same as the public trial of other criminals, allowing civilians to observe. However, war criminals are only tried once by a military tribunal, and a judgment can be made immediately. "Enemy collaborators," however, are tried twice, first by the magistrate's court - called the Summary Court during the military administration - and then by the High Court. Although there are witnesses giving testimony and defense lawyers making arguments, the procedure is relatively fast. From the day of arraignment to the day of judgment, it takes no more than a month, so six batches were tried within 100 days. Although four batches of enemy collaborators have been brought to court, the first batch of six people has not been adjudicated yet, due to individual trials. The public trials of the various batches of war criminals are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) The first batch of 15 war criminals was charged with torturing and killing residents of Silvermine Bay, Lantau Island, from August 18 to August 26, 1945. The trial began on March 28 and ended on April 25: Lieutenant Abo Yasuo (commander of the Japanese army squadron stationed there), Lieutenant Matsumoto, and Sergeant Uchida were sentenced to death. Warrant Officer Yanagisawa and Corporal Kamishiro were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Sergeant Yoshikawa was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Sergeant Kodama was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Sergeant Sukito, Corporal Jun Take, Corporal Nishizawa, and Corporal Uemura and Corporal Okamoto were sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Warrant Officer Ando, Sergeant Shiromori, and Private First Class Takahashi were acquitted and released.</p>
<p>(2) War criminal Matsuda Kenichi, a sergeant in the Japanese military police, nicknamed "Tiger Boy," was sentenced on May 10 to eight years' imprisonment for torturing a Chinese man, Li Jinman, to death. The verdict was on May 14.</p>
<p>(3) War criminal Inoue Kinio, an interpreter for the Japanese military police, nicknamed "King of Torture," was charged on May 22 with torturing prisoners of war and civilians and sentenced to death on May 27.</p>
<p>(4) Four war criminals, Japanese military police, were charged on May 30 with torturing seven Chinese people. On June 11, the verdicts were: Corporal Sano sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, Warrant Officer Kurosawa sentenced to six years' imprisonment, Sergeant Iida (nicknamed "Watering King of South China") sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and Sergeant Sakamoto acquitted.</p>
<p>(5) War criminal Omura Kiyoshi, a warrant officer in the Japanese military police, was charged on July 2 with torturing six Chinese people and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on July 4.</p>
<p>(6) War criminal Sergeant Kawamoto of the Japanese military police was charged on July 9 with torturing a British man to death and sentenced to death on July 10.</p>
<p>Nono Kenosuke, the former commander of the Japanese military police in Hong Kong, Major General Okada, who represented the Japanese army in Hong Kong in the surrender, and Lieutenant General Sakai Takashi, who commanded the Japanese army's attack on Hong Kong, have also been listed as war criminals in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Army Military Tribunal is currently collecting evidence. Except for Sakai Takashi, who is being tried in Nanjing by our country, the other criminals will be brought to trial one after another in the coming days.</p>
<p>Enemy Collaborators</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government formally announced on February 7: All those who "during the Japanese occupation, adhered to or assisted the Japanese; or acted in a way that was detrimental to the war aims of the Allied nations; or who committed offenses against the defense laws of the Hong Kong government; or who committed serious crimes against the criminal laws of Hong Kong" shall all be treated as war criminals (War Criminals). In this way, war criminals are no different from what our country refers to as "Han traitors." When the first enemy collaborator, Huang Zuo, was publicly tried, the chief prosecutor formally defined High Treason for enemy collaborators as "committing treason against the 1351 Treason Act (Edward III, Chapter 2) within the territory of Hong Kong and its dependencies." In other words, those who were disloyal to the British Crown or "who acted as traitors when the British Crown and its subjects were openly at war with the Japanese military and civilians." Therefore, there is a prerequisite for enemy collaborators: he or she must be British, or have British nationality, or at least have sworn allegiance to the British Crown. Because of this key point, Huang Zuo's defense lawyer made a lengthy argument: Huang is Chinese and should not be governed by British law. He also said that Hong Kong was no longer a British territory after its fall, but a Japanese-occupied territory, and its residents were not required to be loyal to the British Crown. Xu Guozhen's defense lawyer, another enemy collaborator, also said: "The defendant is not a British citizen. All Chinese people are free to travel between China and Hong Kong. It can be argued that Chinese people in Hong Kong do not have to be loyal to the British Crown."</p>
<p>On the eve of the war criminals' trial, the authorities specially displayed 168 photographs of war criminals in two batches in central locations in order to collect evidence from the general public. In Chinese and English, it said: "Do you know him?" and "If you have information about any of them committing war crimes, such as brutal acts, torture, etc., please write down the photograph number and come to Room 305, 4th Floor, HSBC Building." However, there was no such procedure for the trial of enemy collaborators. Most of the witnesses who testified in court about the past enemy collaboration activities of the enemy collaborators were British intelligence agents and their families who had been tortured by the enemy collaborators. One of them was even the government prosecutor who is now serving in court. After Li Jie, one of the enemy collaborators, was sentenced to death, he angrily defended himself in court: "I feel extremely unfair about the verdict, because the statements made by the various witnesses contain many errors and are mostly fabricated. Although I am now sentenced to death, I am not afraid of death. However, I am extremely eager to make the whole story of this case public to society, so that people of reason in society can make a fair judgment. What I find even more unfair is that there are many more important traitors in Hong Kong who are still at large, or have been arrested but ultimately released, while insignificant people like me are being severely punished."</p>
<p>Huang Zuo, the first enemy collaborator, was hanged at Stanley Prison on July 10. - He was the second person to be hanged after the British army re-entered Hong Kong. The first was an adopted son who killed his adoptive mother. According to the list of the first batch of enemy collaborators published by the Hong Kong government, there are six in total. In addition to Huang Zuo, there are also Su Liang, Xu Guozhen, Li Jie, Li Caishi (Portuguese), and Jining (Swedish). Since being brought to court on February 19, they have been individually tried in public. Huang was charged with a total of thirty-one counts of crimes. Xu confessed that the former Mayor of Guangzhou, "Chen Ce, was his indirect superior" and was sentenced to death on July 27. Su Liang is still on trial. Li Jie, nicknamed "Number One Secret Agent of Kowloon," "whose brutal behavior was even worse than the enemy's," was sentenced to death on May 30. Li Caishi, who was accused of "colluding with the enemy to bring the Xian ship from Australia to Hong Kong," is still in custody awaiting trial. Jining, who was accused of "directing the enemy artillery in Kowloon to use Hong Kong as a target for shooting," was acquitted at the public trial on April 17 because his defense lawyer argued that "according to the British government's grace measures, those suspected of assisting the enemy, but found to have no brutal behavior, cannot be prosecuted." This grace measure has benefited many other "enemy collaborators" who have not yet been announced! But Jining was ultimately deported from Hong Kong for life by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>The second batch of enemy collaborators consists of five Indians and two Chinese. The third batch consists of three Westerners, one Indian, and five Chinese. The fourth batch consists of nine Chinese. All of these have been brought to court one after another. Except for the three Westerners who have been released on bail, none of the other prisoners have been convicted. According to a report on May 4, the authorities were preparing to deport a batch of enemy collaborators, including four Westerners, one Indian, and ten Chinese. Some of those who are being held in prison have already shouted out to request that the judge make a speedy judgment this month.</p>
<h3 id="e106">An Interesting Episode at the British Commonwealth Conference <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>There was an interesting episode at the Commonwealth Conference: When British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain was preparing to completely withdraw its troops stationed in India, opposition leader Churchill questioned whether the consent of the Commonwealth nations had been sought in advance for this policy decision, or whether they were being asked to approve it after it had become a *fait accompli*. Attlee replied that consent had been obtained in advance. But this was not actually the case. Canada protested first, saying that consent had not been obtained in advance. Australia also complained, saying that at a time when the Commonwealth nations were discussing how to strengthen their participation in imperial decision-making, the government had made this important decision without first obtaining the consent of the Commonwealth nations. Thus, there was another verbal storm in the House of Commons, which was resolved only after much explanation. At the same time, it seems that the Commonwealth nations are exerting considerable indirect influence on the mother country's foreign policy. (Xueyan, dispatch from London, 30th)</p>

<p>Editor: Our school - the Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class Attached to the Special Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class of the Ministry of Education - completed its second semester exams on the 7th of this month. It can also be said that the Provisional University Preparatory Class will be eternally gone. Recalling the four months since the opening of the preparatory class, we have reviewed the entire middle school curriculum, and undergone two rigorous semester written exams. Although we students come from all directions, our goals are the same - hoping to be recommended to a national university. Now that the semester has ended, the Ministry of Education and the school authorities have not announced anything regarding the further education of our preparatory class students. Thinking of this, we envy the students who skipped grades during the puppet regime. Those who were in the same grade as us or lower in the past are now studying in their second or third year of university, and the Ministry of Education is very forgiving of these students, as evidenced by the screening measures. Now, the Shanghai Education Bureau has begun to conduct screening for graduates of secondary schools in the recovered areas, according to the order of the Ministry. We do not know if we will also have to undergo the same screening? We request that the Ministry of Education announce the two major issues of the recommendation of students from the Provisional University Preparatory Class Attached to the Shanghai Provisional University and the screening as soon as possible, so as to avoid students waiting too long and missing the date of the university entrance examination!

<h3 id="e109">Hoping for Middle School Evening Classes <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Editor: Universities such as Shanghai University and Soochow University have evening classes, purely for working youth, but they require a high school diploma. I am a primary school graduate, and I should go on to further education, but due to circumstances, I had to abandon my studies and go into business. But I still cannot forget my desire for education. Although I am supplementing my education in a tutoring night school, it is a school without a system. There must be many others with the same situation as me. Therefore, I hope that each university's evening classes will have a complete middle school evening class attached. Those who graduate from the middle school in the evening class can enter the university class, so that we, the general primary school graduates, can also study hard and obtain a bachelor's degree. I wonder if the school authorities can adopt this? (Luo Jiawei, Shanghai)</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Dispute Between Long-Term and Short-Term Workers <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>We are laborers working at the Tongji Textile and Dyeing Factory at 20 Anda Road. For the past two months, we have consistently arrived early and left late, fulfilling our duties. Now, the factory has no shortage of goods, with vigorous imports and exports. However, on the morning of July 2nd at 9:00 AM, the factory suddenly dismissed over forty of us. At that time, we immediately appointed a representative to ask for the reason for the dismissal. They said that the factory has rules stipulating that workers who have been at the factory for three months are promoted to long-term workers. Since you have only been here for a little over two months, you are still considered temporary workers, and the factory can terminate your employment at any time.</p>
<p>However, according to the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, the compensation for temporary workers must exceed that of long-term workers by 35%. Yet, our compensation as temporary workers is only four-fifths of that of long-term workers. Furthermore, the factory is not lacking business. If it were lacking business and completely shut down, we would not make unreasonable demands, preferring to face unemployment.</p>
<p>At the time, we immediately requested the Third District Dyeing and Weaving Industry Labor Union to send representatives to demand reinstatement from the factory. The labor union sent members Xu Wenhua and Li Sixun to the factory to demand reinstatement again. The factory director, He Yutang, presented the following conditions to the labor union members: this group of workers, who entered the factory before June 30th, must have their past two months of work nullified, and they cannot continue from the later date to be promoted to long-term workers. Otherwise, they will definitely be dismissed.</p>
<p>We respectfully ask people from all walks of life for guidance. Is this reasoning correct? What will we do to survive after losing our jobs? (Tongji New Workers)</p>

<p>We are a group of refugees from Northern Jiangsu. Our hometowns have been occupied by the Communist army since the victory and are now called the "Liberated Areas." After experiencing the Communist army's policies of "three resources," "three equalizations," and "three clearances," tens of millions of our compatriots are in dire straits. We are unwilling to endure their oppression (which is fundamentally not allowed to exist) and have successively fled south, gathering in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, numbering no less than three million people. The intermittent ceasefire negotiations, such as allowing the CCP to station two divisions in the Northern Jiangsu region, stationed in Huai'an and north of it, we firmly oppose. Because isn't this just like the era of the enemy puppets? Separating Huai'an into "Central China" and "North China" regions, to divide the whole and then return to the Communist Party's jurisdiction, we demand that the government preserve the unity of military and administrative orders in Jiangsu Province; not only Northern Jiangsu, but all parts of the country should also have the power to unify military and administrative orders. Although we refugees are currently receiving the government's attention and relief, as well as sympathy and donations from all sides, providing temporary comfort, it is not a long-term solution. We must eventually return home, and we ask the government and fair-minded people to assist us.

<h3 id="e112">The Voices of Public Toilet Management Workers <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been reports that public toilets have increased the price of defecation three times in a row, increasing the burden on citizens. We, the workers managing public toilets, would like to offer an explanation and appeal to the authorities for assistance: (1) We workers purchase toilet paper for defecation from contractors, and after paying the contract price, what remains is barely enough to maintain our families. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and mistakenly believe that public toilets are absolutely free. This is a misunderstanding. (2) In the past few months, the cleaning department was responsible for assessing and paying sales fees, which were paid according to the actual situation. However, starting in June, the authorities changed their policy to focus on increasing revenue, contracting the public toilet department to merchants at a price about ten times higher. Merchants, whose purpose is to make a profit, pass on the contract price to the workers. Therefore, each public toilet pays tens of thousands of yuan, and it is difficult to bear this huge compensation without increasing the price of defecation. Therefore, we have made a slight increase. (3) From this day forward, all of us workers have been ordered by the Lei Bureau to reduce sales by 20 yuan each time. Not only can we not maintain our livelihoods with this, but we must also compensate with huge amounts of money. We are forced to appeal to the authorities and request: (1) Please adjust the selling price to 40 yuan. (2) Reduce the contract price by four-tenths. (3) Fix the long-term contract price and limit price changes within one year. In summary, we hope that the relevant authorities will adopt our requests. We are extremely grateful!

<p>(1) Gao Junyong asks: My friend A lived with his adopted daughter-in-law B in the winter of 1927. Without marriage, they cohabited for five years and had a son. Later, in 1933, they became enemies because of economic pressure, causing B to abandon her husband and son and leave home without a trace. Later, in 1939, she cohabited with a pseudo-squad leader C and has been living together for seven years, without having any children. My friend A is very honest, but although he knows about this, he is afraid of C's power, so he has not dared to sue in court until now. Now, B is homesick (the son is already seventeen years old), has repented of the past, and is willing to reconcile. However, C is obstructing her from the middle, threatening her verbally, causing A great mental pain. Therefore, I am asking the following questions on his behalf, hoping that you can answer them in your column. I would be very grateful! 1. Although A and B were not formally married and there is no evidence (such as betrothal cards), they cohabited for five years and had a son. Can they be considered husband and wife in law? 2. A and B have not gone through the procedures for ending cohabitation and have been separated for fourteen years. Can the name of husband and wife still be established? 3. Is C guilty of occupying another man's wife? What kind of crime is it? However, they have been cohabiting for seven years. Can it be said that A has tacitly approved and obtained legal cohabitation? 4. Can A formally sue C for hindering the family?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu answers] 1. They cannot be considered husband and wife. 2. There is no name of husband and wife. 3. B is not a married woman. 4. A cannot sue C for hindering the family. 5. B cannot be charged with bigamy or adultery.</p>
<p>(2) Huang Yao asks: Zhang Jun's family has lived in a traditional single-story house (a total of three rooms) at No. X Changping Road for generations. From April 1940, he rented it to Jiang Jun for a term of four years (without a lease agreement). He had collected rent monthly for four years. In April 1944, Zhang Jun's children increased in number, and his own residence was not enough. He asked Jiang Jun to move out and take it back for his own use, not collecting rent until now for two years. However, Jiang Jun still makes excuses and refuses to move out, and repeated reminders have been ineffective. He had no choice but to apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Management Committee for mediation, which was also unsuccessful. Now there are several questions: 1. Which articles of law has Jiang Jun violated in this case? Is there any conflict between Zhang Jun's facts and the law? 2. What evidence should Zhang Jun present to the court when he sues to take it back for his own use? 3. How should we deal with Jiang Jun's lies? 4. Is it possible for the court to rule that "the defendant continues to live there"? What is the reason? I have asked for your advice and would be grateful if you could provide a public reply.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] 1. Jiang Jun violated Article 450, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code. 2, 4. Taking back for personal use requires proof from the police, self-governing organization, or housing lease management committee. 3. If Jiang Jun is lying, you must present evidence.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Lide asks: A owns a large foreign-style house. During the enemy-puppet period, it was sold to a Japanese company. Because foreigners cannot obtain ownership of real estate in China, a Chinese B was used as the nominal buyer. The sales contract was kept by the company. After the victory, before the Japanese residents were sent to the concentration camp, A repurchased the house and sales contract from B at the original price and gave B a considerable reward, stipulating that if a problem occurred, B would claim to be the actual buyer. Now A has sold the house to a certain organization. (1) Is this property enemy property? (2) What is B's legal responsibility? (3) Is the sales contract between A and the organization valid? (4) Is the price obtained by A unjustly enriched? If it is unjustly enriched, who should it be returned to? (5) If A cannot hand over the price, what should be done?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] (1) Since it was purchased with funds from an enemy Japanese company, it is enemy property. (2) B has no right to dispose of the property. (3) The sales contract between A and the organization is not legally valid. (4) The price received by A from the organization should be returned to the original owner. If it cannot be returned, there is no choice but to seek a court decision.</p>

<p>During the War of Resistance, "Military Affairs First"; during the period of national reconstruction, "Education First." Many educators have issued urgent appeals, calling for speeding up the restoration of the education sector, demanding that the authorities allocate more education funds, and people across the country have united to make efforts to relieve out-of-school children.</p>
<p>Indeed, how much work have the children done?</p>
<p>Tuition fees are so expensive that the majority of parents with meager incomes feel overwhelmed, and how many school authorities are truly teaching children well? Teachers' lives are difficult, and they have no choice but to exert their best efforts to teach part-time everywhere, so they are mentally exhausted during class, and revising homework is even more exhausting.</p>
<p>We sympathize with the teachers. We forgive their difficulties. But we also cannot deny a fact, which is that, under the current circumstances, children can really learn very little in school. We do not approve of turning innocent and lively children into hunchbacked and nearsighted little scholars. All we ask is that the school give them a healthy life, a pure atmosphere. The purpose of publishing these photos here is to draw everyone's attention - please take a look, is this kind of life healthy? Is it pure?</p>
<p>These are all innocent children! But on the streets, they learn to play cards and fight crickets. They don't have books that suit their tastes, so they sit quietly in front of small bookstores, calmly accepting the toxins of gods, monsters, superstitions, and pornography in those small books. They don't have appropriate places to exercise, so they kick soccer balls and play games on the crowded and messy street corners, and how many speeding cars in Shanghai threaten these small, lovely lives every day!</p>

<h3 id="e122">Literary Sensitivity <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Kai Yin</p>
<p>Literary workers are always at the forefront of the times, and the creation is a soul adventure. We say that literary workers must have a sensitivity different from ordinary people, and its significance lies in the fact that sensitivity is a sign of prescience. Without sensitivity, a writer cannot grasp the most tempting things in the vast life and express the most important things. Sensitivity is the intellectual antenna of literary workers.</p>
<p>Sensitivity and so-called "nervousness" are absolutely different. The former is a premonition of undiscovered things based on the correct position, while the latter is a kind of self-consciousness, a kind of morbid illusion. Usually, when self-consciousness develops too abnormally, it forms signs of nervousness. The literary sensitivity we are talking about should be the recognition of objective necessity through subjective and calm observation. Because of sensitivity, the writer's subject matter will never be exhausted. He will never live in the crowd in a muddled way, but will always retain a deep concern. If the literary worker himself is numb and indifferent to things, then his sensitivity is definitely not healthy.</p>
<p>Secondly, some people confuse the meaning of sensitivity with inspiration, which is wrong. Inspiration is extremely abstract. It is only the harmony of emotional development with the desire to write. Its main significance lies in the success of a creation because of the burning of the desire to write. But sensitivity is different. It is the pursuit of concrete things between the present and the future. It is in the observation of life, not in the practice of writing. Those who emphasize inspiration are mostly romantic writers. They think that when inspiration comes, ideas will flow like a spring, and then a great work is produced; but sensitivity is not like this. It is like a news reporter's nose. It can also predict the possible development of things that are still brewing, or it can obtain a line for interviewing news. Sensitivity works at any time in daily life. It requires profound observation, and without the guidance of sensitivity, failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>For example, Newton, because he saw an apple falling from a tree, most people would not pay attention to it, but he was surprised and researched the reason. This can be said to be a kind of sensitivity to natural phenomena, which is precious.</p>
<p>Writers, like social natural scientists, need a calm mind to observe things, analyze phenomena, and need a cautious and careful research attitude. Sensitivity is just one of the conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Silhouette (Novel) (Part 2) <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>Ru Ji exhaled a large mouthful of thick smoke, peering at Xiao Shi from within the smoke, remaining silent. Then, after taking four or five more puffs, he said weakly,</p>
<p>"I know, I know I shouldn't do this, but the environment doesn't allow me not to! I feel a strong force driving me; I desperately need that silhouette!" As he spoke, he nodded resolutely.</p>
<p>"..." Xiao Shi now began to feel that it was useless to try and dissuade him; because he had already stated that he "needed" that silhouette! He needed to eat; could you persuade him not to? More persuasion would not only fail to change his mind but might even strengthen his conviction, making it even more unshakable! So, he closed his eyes and pondered quietly, his forehead crisscrossed with wrinkles. For the moment, he seemed to have forgotten that a friend was sitting in the room, he was only concerned with engaging his own mind.</p>
<p>Ru Ji looked at his watch again, lazily picked up his hat, and seemed about to leave. He stuck the remaining short cigarette in his mouth, puffing it diligently, and said softly, "I'm sorry to have made you waste so much time for nothing, Xiao Shi. I feel quite relieved now, because the frustrations accumulated in my heart have been poured out and vented! Alas, but who knows what the future holds? If you don't mind the trouble, I think—I still want to borrow your ears as a tool to wash away my troubles! At this moment, I want to—"</p>
<p>Xiao Shi, in his state of contemplation, hadn't heard a word of Ru Ji's until Ru Ji uttered the words "I want," and then he awoke as if from a dream, quickly walking to Ru Ji's side, placing his hand on his shoulder, and said cheerfully,</p>
<p>"Hey, Ru Ji, I've found a solution! I can save you! I can make you happy!"</p>
<p>Ru Ji held his head high, playing with the smoke as usual, waiting a while before asking indifferently,</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Oh, would I lie to you?"</p>
<p>"Then please, what's your solution? Tell me."</p>
<p>Xiao Shi twitched his nose, holding Ru Ji's hand and saying,</p>
<p>"This... it's not convenient to reveal just yet, because you're too stubborn. If I told you, you might disagree, or be unwilling, and all that, so I think it's safer not to announce it! In short, Ru Ji, I vow to do my best to help you solve this problem! As for what steps to take, you don't need to worry about that!"</p>
<p>"No, please tell me!"</p>
<p>"No, I can't tell you! You lack patience! It's really late now, you should go home. I'll call you in a couple of days to discuss things!"</p>
<p>Xiao Shi's so-called "solution" was not really a clever plan. He was simply planning to shift Ru Ji's thoughts from Min Yu and the silhouette to somewhere else, to make him forget the silhouette and seek happiness and interest in other things! If such a solution could be realized, it would of course be extremely satisfactory; in fact, there was no other way to alleviate Ru Ji's pain! However, Ru Ji himself seemed to have tried this method before, and the result was failure. For example, he let work and reading occupy his time, he went to Wuxi, and so on, but the result was always an inability to break free, always unable to jump out of the walls built by painful memories!</p>
<p>Then, looking at it this way, this method has no effect, so how can Xiao Shi be so confident in telling him that he has a solution to save him? It turns out that Xiao Shi, while contemplating, carefully analyzed the matter and discovered the crux of Ru Ji's failure! He believed that Ru Ji's method—which was actually his own method—was absolutely flawless in principle. The reason for his failure was entirely due to the inappropriate choice of goals for shifting his thoughts, thinking that books, work, new environments, and so on, were lifeless things. Things without life, their ability to attract attention, was of course inevitably weaker than things with life and vitality! So, Xiao Shi was prepared to guide Ru Ji's thoughts towards a goal with life and vitality!</p>
<p>He remembered that on the day of his engagement, there was a young and beautiful Miss Sun Yun among the guests, who attracted the attention of all the guests present! This Miss Sun was a very close classmate of his fiancée. As for her appearance and figure, she was indeed worthy of the word "beautiful"! Miss Shi—his fiancée—was also beautiful, but Miss Shi's beauty was quiet, gentle, and virtuous, while Miss Sun's beauty was lively and light! Such a lively, intelligent, and beautiful Miss, no matter who saw her, could not help but envy her! So, Xiao Shi believed that if he introduced her to Ru Ji, Ru Ji would definitely not be able to resist her allure! At the same time, Ru Ji himself was also a fairly handsome young man; Miss Sun's beauty, paired with Ru Ji's handsomeness, seemed to be a perfect match!</p>
<p>However, before Ru Ji had seen her, before he had forgotten Min Yu, he was probably not going to agree to this proposal, because he was very stubborn. So, the only way was not to let him know in advance, and to see how he reacted after a sudden introduction? Was Min Yu's magic stronger, or was Miss Sun's temptation stronger? If it was the former, then of course he would continue to miss his lost Min Yu, if it was the latter, then he could turn back to the shore and approach Miss Sun! According to Xiao Shi's estimation, although Ru Ji was fond of Min Yu, she ultimately had no feelings for him, so his plan would definitely be victorious!</p>
<p>Miss Shi lived in a school dormitory, and only stayed at home two days a week. Originally, she was prepared not to live in the dormitory after she got engaged, but she thought that the home environment was too noisy and not suitable for studying, so she still decided to stay at school. Whenever she returned home on Saturday, Xiao Shi would go to the Shi's house to chat with her, and on Sunday, Miss Shi would come to Xiao Shi's house, or go out to play.</p>
<p>This Sunday, Xiao Shi agreed with Miss Shi to invite Miss Sun and Ru Ji to go to the movies together. Miss Shi naturally expressed her support for Xiao Shi's plan. They expected that in the cinema, going in would be two couples and two singles, but coming out would be two couples!</p>
<p>When Ru Ji arrived at the cinema, the other three had been waiting for a long time. Miss Shi and Miss Sun were waiting by the escalator inside because they disliked the dust at the entrance of the cinema, but Xiao Shi was afraid that Ru Ji would not be able to find them when he arrived, so he stood alone at the entrance waiting.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sorry, I'm late!" Ru Ji panted.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," Xiao Shi replied with a smile. "You don't need to apologize to me. It's true that you should apologize to them later!"</p>
<p>"Them? Who?" Ru Ji said with a smile, "Oh, I see, Miss Shi is here too, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"Yes... you'll understand in a moment, let's go in!"</p>
<p>Pushing open the glass door, Ru Ji's eyes scanned around, and suddenly he shouted softly,</p>
<p>"Silhouette! Silhouette!"</p>
<p>Xiao Shi was taken aback at first, then looked at Ru Ji's face and suddenly said,</p>
<p>"You remembered that silhouette again?"</p>
<p>"No, Xiao Shi, it's here! The silhouette is here, I've reunited with her!"</p>
<p>"Where? Where?" Xiao Shi asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Standing by the escalator, wearing a pink short coat!... Alas, I want to go up! I want to..."</p>
<p>Xiao Shi was stunned listening to his words! He grabbed Ru Ji's sleeve, his lips trembling, unable to speak! After half a moment, he managed to squeeze out a sentence with great effort:</p>
<p>"That, that's my fiancée!" 3/5, 3/29. (The End)</p>

<p>"Xiao Hua, let me introduce you to Mr. Dong Shaoling, the Chinese teacher at our school," Liu Ziyun said, pointing to the man. "His knowledge is very good, and you can learn a lot from him in the future. He is not only knowledgeable but also talented; he can play instruments, sing, and act! He goes to see your plays almost every day. He greatly admires your art."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Zhang Xuan widened his eyes, glared at Dong Shaoling, sneered, and said coldly,</p>
<p>"Mr. Dong is so knowledgeable and talented that our Xiao Hua is simply too good for him."</p>
<p>"Master!" Li Hua walked towards Zhang Xuan with a stern face. "It's getting late, you can go back." Saying this, she gestured for him to leave.</p>
<p>"What?" Zhang Xuan looked very resentful, and said with a sneer! "It's getting late, but the guest hasn't left yet, has he?"</p>
<p>Li Hua was simply furious and shouted sternly,</p>
<p>"Master!"</p>
<p>"Okay, my Ink Boss! Don't worry, I'm leaving now. Since you hate me, I'll go sit in the outer room, come on, let's warm up the voice for Little..." Saying this, Zhang Xuan picked up his Erhu and glared at Dong Shaoling again, then stumbled out.</p>
<p>"Mom, my master is so rude, I can't let him come to our house again!" Li Hua said angrily to Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>"Tsk, tsk, tsk, that's just him, don't pay attention to him." Mrs. Mo comforted Li Hua, and then went out as well.</p>
<p>At this time, the Erhu sounded outside, and Li Yun sang: "Selling the Horse". Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling looked at each other silently. Dong Shaoling looked a little uncertain and kept gesturing for Liu Ziyun to leave, but Liu Ziyun refused to move, and gestured to stop Dong Shaoling.</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu! This, this is why I didn't want to tell... my identity," Li Hua said sadly after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua, I expected that you must have many difficulties in your heart. Come to school tomorrow and talk to me. Don't be so depressed, be careful you'll ruin your health." Liu Ziyun went over sympathetically, stroked Li Hua, and said comfortingly.</p>
<p>"Sigh!" Dong Shaoling sighed deeply, said nothing, put on his hat, and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dong!" Li Hua looked up, with tears in her eyes, and said to him: "I'm really sorry!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing!" Dong Shaoling was also a little embarrassed. He urged Liu Ziyun again. "Let's go!"</p>
<p>Liu Ziyun then nodded, picked up his raincoat, and patted Li Hua.</p>
<p>"Don't be sad, come to school to play tomorrow!" After saying that, Liu Ziyun went out.</p>

<p>The traffic situation in Shanghai, if it continues like this, will be a terrible future.</p>
<p>Taking the Route 1 trolleybus from the end of North Sichuan Road to Shanxi Road takes an average of 50 minutes, and the waiting time, from 10 minutes to half an hour, depends on your luck.</p>
<p>The chaotic, disorderly state of the roads is fully demonstrated on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road, making one suspect that they are fleeing or that enemy planes are attacking, otherwise how could there be such a hurried look.</p>
<p>Military trucks and jeeps crash around; three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws weave around in the gaps;… we can't help but admire the bravery of these drivers, and even more admire their skills.</p>
<p>Many drivers are very proud, they don't take traffic violations seriously, they say, even if you drive a car without a license now, it's no big deal to be fined 1,000 yuan? Yes, compared to the old days when the concession would arrest you and put you in the Western prison for two days, it's really no big deal. Just two hours before I wrote this article, the rickshaw I was in crossed the Nanjing Road and Chengdu Road intersection under a red light, passing through two policemen without any trouble.</p>
<p>Shanghai makes newcomers dizzy, and traffic chaos is a major reason. It would be shameless of us to say that this is the face of urban prosperity!</p>
<p>Some people suggest banning three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws, and we absolutely agree, but we hope that before the ban, transportation tools for millions of citizens to travel must be arranged first: and before this step, traffic management must be strict and thorough, don't just hold a few meetings, issue a declaration, post a few slogans, and have a few conductors decorating the intersections during the "movement" days, and then everything is back to normal.</p>
<p>We citizens silently pray that the municipal authorities will immediately take the most appropriate measures!</p>
<h3 id="e128">Resurrection <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>"Soviet scientists have found that 51 civilians who died have come back to life as a result of experiments."</p>
<p>In the past, people were divided into two major categories: living and dead. Between life and death, there is a clear boundary. Once you enter the "other world," you can never return to the human world—unless an incredible miracle occurs.</p>
<p>For most of them, the period of revival was very short, only a few hours or days. They eat, drink, talk, and even write letters, but the damage to vital organs ultimately cannot be saved.</p>
<p>Of the 51 people, 12 are still alive, living normal lives.</p>
<p>The method used by these Soviet scientists is very simple: after death, rescue as quickly as possible, injecting warm blood, mixed with adrenal compounds and glucose, into the brachial artery—the shortcut to the heart. Under high pressure, this mixture can cause the heart to contract, causing blood to flow from the arteries into the veins.</p>
<p>At the same time, doctors use artificial respiration to restore the dead person's breathing, which often needs to be continued for a long time, perhaps up to an hour after life is restored, until the patient can breathe freely.</p>
<p>The results of Soviet medical experiments tell us that the weakest part of the human body is not the heart, but the nervous system. It is the first to die from long-term anemia.</p>
<p>Dr. Negovsky announced to the world: "We cannot give up our efforts because the patient's heart and breathing have stopped, we should continue to fight for the patient's life, especially those who die suddenly… Hearts that have stopped beating can sometimes beat again."</p>
<p>Now, science has a different explanation for life and death. There is no definite distance between life and death. Even if a person enters the realm of death, he still has a chance to return to the living world.</p>
<p>This means that after you die, you still have a chance to come back to life. This is not just a sensational theory, but 51 people have already been saved from death using this new method.</p>
<p>Currently, to save a dead person, the time of death cannot be too long, about five minutes or so. But, the important thing is that dead people can be saved. Those who die from fainting, excessive bleeding, or other curable diseases have gained new life.</p>
<p>This resurrection technique was researched by Dr. Negovsky of the Soviet Ministry of Health and his deputies. Initially, they used this technique to save fallen soldiers, and now it is used on civilians. They also provide all data and technology to doctors in the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>From Life to Death in Several Stages</p>
<p>The basis of Negovsky's resurrection technique is that the various parts of the human body do not die at the same time. He discovered: "Death is not the sudden cessation of life; from life to death, there are several transitional stages."</p>
<p>Therefore, although the heart stops, other parts of the body may still be alive. A doctor can declare this person dead, but it is not "biological death" (all parts of the human body are dead), and he often has a chance to be resurrected.</p>
<p>There was a private in the Red Army named Zhirimanov who was seriously injured in the hip and had completely lost consciousness when he was taken to the hospital. He was carried to the operating table, but the situation was getting worse and worse. Finally, the heart stopped, breathing stopped, and nerve reflexes disappeared.</p>
<p>The surgeon routinely reported: "Death due to syncope and excessive bleeding."</p>
<p>At this time, Dr. Negovsky walked in. Three minutes later, he started working. One minute later, he started working. One minute later, Zhirimanov's heart began to beat; three minutes later, he began to breathe; within an hour, he regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Soon after, he fell asleep. Called his name, he opened his eyes and answered questions. He wanted water to drink. His breathing was normal and even, and his pulse was normal.</p>
<p>Today, Zhirimanov is doing very well, and he simply cannot believe that he is a person who has died once.</p>
<p>What Is the Afterlife Like?</p>
<p>A reporter asked him if he had seen anything interesting in the other world. Scratching his head, he apologized and replied: "Actually, I didn't see anything. At the moment of death, I had already lost consciousness, and I didn't regain consciousness until after the surgery. It was like having been anesthetized."</p>
<p>Dr. Negovsky said that the first thing dead people lose is consciousness; and the last thing to recover after resurrection is consciousness. The patient does not know the beginning of death, so he knows nothing about everything after death.</p>
<p>Zhirimanov is one of the 51 dead people saved by Dr. Negovsky. So these people all died because their internal organs or limbs were seriously injured, and ordinary rescue methods were ineffective.</p>

<p>During the period of occupation in this city, all the poor Shanghai citizens, in addition to bearing all kinds of exorbitant taxes, had to pay a "Baojia donation," and within the Baojia column, there were countless inexplicable donations. In short, nothing was spared, and everything from air defense and fire fighting to the tools used for mines, self-defense kiosks, and corps uniforms, all this was scraped from the people's heads, causing the people to be bruised and bleeding, and complaints were endless.</p>
<p>Many of the receivers after the victory seemed to focus on the big picture, thus ignoring the small things, just like the large number of self-defense corps helmets in the city mentioned in this article, which the public has completely forgotten, is this not sad?</p>
<p>Moreover, these helmets are now becoming waste, so why not use them? Besides, everything belonging to the public, whether it's a blade of grass or a tree, should be returned to the public without exception. What I mean is that this large number of helmets should be investigated by the military organs of this city, tasking the Baojia chiefs to pursue them, ordering those who hide them to hand them over, and those who have lost them must compensate according to the market price, because they are useless to the possessors, and many comrades in the army are still lacking helmets, so taking them back and returning them to the public is not troublesome, so why not do it?</p>

<p>The High Court recently pronounced judgments on many traitor cases, with many sentences ranging from two to three years, which may have made many people feel relieved, but it must also have made many people feel chilled.</p>
<p>Boy Scouts at the North Railway Station persuade travelers to get vaccinations, even begging, which shows the low level of knowledge of the general public. Some people are afraid of trouble and small pain, but they are not afraid of life-threatening dangers, and some people are probably even unaware of the meaning of vaccination, which is even more pitiful.</p>
<p>The previous few hurricanes in the Pacific were fortunately extinguished, allowing Shanghai to avoid being attacked, but as soon as one wind disappears, another wind rises. Whether Shanghai can always be safe is still unknown. The news of hurricanes existing for one more day means that the people of Shanghai will have one more day of worry.</p>
<p>Regarding the materials involved in Jiang Gongmei's case, many of them have already rotted. According to reports, the authorities concerned "will draw up detailed methods in the coming days and present them to the commander for approval before unsealing and selling them." The news of the rot of Jiang's case materials seems to have been seen as early as two months ago, and now we are only hearing about the submission of the application for unsealing and sale, but "in the coming days," "will," "draw up," "present for approval"... it seems that it will have to go through several stages, and even if "approval is granted for sale," I am afraid that this batch of materials will have reached the stage of "waste utilization."</p>
<p>The wife of Wu Shibao, the demon of "No. 76," defended her deceased husband in court, saying that Wu had never fired a gun or killed anyone. Indeed, I also believe that Wu Shibao would not go to the execution ground to personally shoot "criminals."</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Your spirit of urging me to work hard and showing consideration for the servants was something no ordinary housewife possessed. Every day you would rise before dawn, often ahead of Auntie Ye, first sweeping the bedroom. Then you would go downstairs to the kitchen, light the briquette stove, and then boil water to cook porridge, so that the children could get up, wash, and have breakfast without being late for teaching, studying, or work. When Auntie Ye went to the market for groceries, you would busy yourself selecting and washing rice, preparing everything in advance, and then have your own breakfast, sometimes even forgetting it and skipping a meal. Seeing that you ate little and had so much to do, and that you were working so hard, I always advised you to rest more. You would reply, "Auntie Ye can't manage everything alone. The children will be back for lunch, so I want to prepare everything early, so I can feel at ease." I couldn't convince you otherwise, so I had to let you be. After a short rest in the afternoon, you would busy yourself with needlework, putting on your glasses and working tirelessly, even mending our torn clothes and unraveling shoes and socks. Although the children had all grown up and wore leather shoes outside, the cloth-soled shoes they wore at home were all made by you. Over the past twenty-nine years, including those for my mother, you must have made thousands of pairs. Making the uppers was not considered difficult, but the fine, dense stitching of the soles was both laborious and time-consuming, even causing calluses to form between the two fingers that held the needle. In short, you were always trying to save me money and plan for me, day in and day out for twenty-nine years. As for entertainment, during these nine years of national crisis, it was practically nonexistent. Sometimes, because my mother, your mother, and your aunt all loved to play mahjong, you would reluctantly join in, which for you was simply an obligation and not entertainment.</p>
<p>Last winter, our family had already decided to move back to our old home in Suzhou. I repeatedly invited you to go out and see a technicolor movie and have a Western meal that you loved, but you declined time and again, saying, "Dear, save your money. Let me rest at home; you go by yourself." When you did go out, the farthest you would go was to your mother's house on Dihua Road. You wouldn't even venture into the Jing'an Temple area, saying, "Once I go there and see the dazzling shop windows, I can't help but spend your money." Once, the newspaper office sent over several thousand dollars in manuscript fees. I casually handed them to you, and you took them in your hands, and tears welled up in your eyes. You sobbed, "Dear, this is what you earned with your heart's blood over the past month. How can I bear to spend it?" I quickly said, "Writing this kind of article is easy, it doesn't take much effort. Besides, since you are so considerate of me, I would be willing to pour out my heart's blood!" After much persuasion, you finally accepted.</p>
