<h3>憲草審查加速進行　各審委會同時舉行會議　新憲法明年元旦可公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國大對憲草修正問題，一俟商妥，即可順利完成，大會預定十三日再開，十九日如尙不能討論完竣，則再延長十天，至廿九日閉幕，新憲法或將於卅六年元旦公布。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國民大會各憲草審査會，九日會議時及地點，業經決定，茲分誌如後：第一審委會召集人會議，四時，地址行政司法院。第二審委會召集人會議，二時，全體會三時地址大會堂第二休息室。第三審委會十時至十二時，下午三時至六時，地址第一休息室。第四審委會九時至十二時，下午三時至六時，地址公餘聯歡社文化會堂，第五審委會三時至六時，地址公餘聯歡社二樓。第六寨委會三時至六時，地址華僑招待所，第七審委會十時至十二時，下午三時至六時，地址大會會塲，第八審委會繼續休息。又憲草各審委會，將加速進行審査，俾大會於十九日如期結束。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕憲草第二審委會召集人第二次會，於八日下午二時假大會堂二樓第一休息室舉行，決定九日之會議後，並就該會秘書整理歸納後之提案及意見加以硏討，至下午三時五十分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕社會部長谷正綱氏，日昨抵滬，記者向渠叩詢對憲草修正案之意見，渠稱：本人認爲，憲法中除規定普通選舉外，應兼採職業代表制，並主增列社會安全章。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕國民大會代表報到者八日續有職業代表干汝洲，靑年黨代表譚護二人，連前已報到代表總計一六七五人。國府明令公佈之代表爲一七四四人，未報到者僅六十九人，故報到出席大會之代表，已達百分之九十六。</p>

<h3>國大主席團舉行茶會　招待審會召集人　請加速審查憲草俾十三日提大會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國大主席團招待各審委會召集人之茶會，八日四時十五分假大會堂二樓第一休息室舉行，到孫科，鄒魯，王寵惠，白崇禧，吳鐵城，張厲生，左舜生，陳啓天，蔣均田（盧毅安代）胡適，于斌，傅斯年，白雲梯，白海風，黃正清，陳逸雲，任培遜，洪蘭友，雷震等六十八人，首由孫科致詞謂，此次茶會之目的，乃在商討會議進行之程序，繼並報告十三次主席團會議之決定事項如下：</p>
<p>（一）請各審委會召集人依大會之議事日程表，於九日至十二日四天內，上下午開會，積極進行審查工作，俾可於十三日之大會開始一讀，至十九日結束，如期閉會。</p>
<p>（二）審委會法定人數，定爲參加各該會總人數之十分之一。</p>
<p>（三）提案約四百餘種，編印八本，隨印隨送各審委會。</p>
<p>（四）各審委會成立「初步整理小組」由九召集人及審委會公推之十位代表組成，將提案及廣泛意見歸納列舉，並擬定修正之具體條文後與憲章逐條比較提出審委會。重大或涉及原則之變更，應同時通知主席團轉綜合審委會。召集人對審委會之情形，每晚得集會檢討。</p>
<p>（五）關於新聞記者參加審查會採訪之問題，召集人可斟酌情形，於必要時開秘密會請各記者暫時離塲。</p>
<p>（六）各審委會無須俟提案及廣泛意見全部送達，即可開始整理，排列提出討論。</p>
<p>孫氏辭畢，洪蘭友接稱，接受提案之期限，雖定於九日午夜截止，乃時至今日，猶源源而至，預定全部編爲八册，另總論一册，均正積極趕印，陸續送達各代一表。至各代表於大會上提出之口頭及書面廣泛意見，共的數十萬言，整理分類，殊爲不易，而鉛一印之生產效力已達邊際，決先以一油印分送各關係審委會。</p>
<p>旋國民黨代表鄒魯，任卓宣，及民社黨代表李俊伴就代表於審查會上之發言及臨時意見提出意見，經孫科答覆謂，審査會上仍可商量臨時意見亦可提出，唯如發言時間過長，或意見與大會上已發表而雷同時，審委會主席自可運用其應有之權力，權衡處理，以免耗誤時間。</p>
<p>國民黨代表黃少谷，就提案之分配技術與審委會之性質職權提出問題，亦經洪蘭友·孫科，雷震分別答復：（一）提案及廣泛意見，由秘書處作概括之分類歸納，以書面目錄提出，各審委會有關各組，對某一問題可隨時取得聯絡，（二）第一至八審委會之工作，乃以提案爲主，參考廣泛意見，將各項修正評議後，決定一最適合者提出大會爲負責之審査（三）第九（綜合）審委會之工作，爲對各重要或茲本之修正意見與牽掣較多之問題，有所商決。至此，國民黨代表鍾天心提議，取消議事日程表由聯合審委會及綜一合審委會二會期之規定，主張遇必要時臨時決定召集，而與各審委會以充分之時間開會討論。</p>
<p>彥棻提議，以提案及意見之整理歸納，乃事務工作，並非審査，初步整理小組實無必要，推選之舉徒耗光陰。</p>
<p>林彬亦報吿第二審委會已由召集人及各秘書從事此項工作，進度頗速，均主張無庸更設初步整理小組。</p>
<p>經討論後，決定將此兩問題提出九日晨主席團會議重行考慮。最後由洪蘭友宣讀九日各審委會開會時間及地點後，於六時四十分散會。</p>

<h3>陸空演習觀戰側寫　本報記者張明　白部長說人民代表檢閱人民武力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕白部長和陳總長都穿了高統的皮靴，前者是黃的，後者是黑的，在演習地點解脫村廣塲上，以主人的姿態出現，隨時與來賓握手招呼，和解釋一切，滿面春風。雖然是一身戎裝，却冲淡了不少嚴肅之氣。參觀者的座次佈置得很別緻”雖然是席地而坐，但是把大地鏟成斜　，每一層放有軍用呢毯，坐下後和體育場的看台相同，何况人手點心一盒，可謂皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>白部長講演時，是在來賓對面司令台上，但是轉播器却在來賓的背後，聽到聲音，大家不的而同的轉向後面，而說話的人，却在前面。</p>
<p>救濟總署送來大批配給品，於是領配給品的潮浪，掀動了會塲的「和平·秩序」。</p>
<p>演習開始，轟炸機三架成一小隊，計兩隊排空而來，參謀長沈莊宇報吿這是「敵」機來襲，才一轉回來，左前方，三前二後，五架飛機迎面而來，於是「敵」機開始投彈，參謀長的報吿：『魚貫而入，一架一架的投彈』。聽的人都發笑了。步砲協同的節目裏，砲聲，機槍聲，響澈山岳，儼然置身戰塲，但是反應却是一陣輕鬆的笑聲。砲彈在山坡上爆炸，而且起火了，那熊熊的火光，蔓燒着野草。</p>
<p>在傘兵演習的時候，烟幕放得特別美，有紫，有紅，有黃，有綠，遮蓋了半個天，恰似漫天大霧。傘兵降落開始，朶朵美麗的黑白花從機身壯裏吐出來，晴空裏織繡出點點花朵，色調美麗，正似一幅活動的圖案畫。</p>

<h3>聯總署長發表聲明　解除對華停運令　並逐月規定運華供應品</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日電〕聯總署長賴伽第亞今日發表聲明稱：由於我國境內聯總供應品分配改進之結果，渠實已解聊停止物資運華之命令。賴氏前提辭呈，將於十二月十日生效。上項聲明，於其辭戰前二日發表此乃我行總副署長李卓敏在醫府與聯總協商，及行總駐華府辦事處主任鄭實南，在此間與賴伽第亞協商之結果。賴氏已　定一種制度，使聯總能按共對中國分配能力之估計，運送供應品至中國。鄭氏對記者發表關於此事之談話稱：目前我國分發物資之能力，估計爲每月十七萬五千噸，在我國內地運輸及港口設備改進時，分發能力，可再增加。賴氏聲明全文如次：鑒於中國國內特資分發率不斷改進，尤其港口壓積物資目前已完全出清，至　滿意，如本署中國分署署長艾格頓所報告者，余已解除停止物資運華之命令，惟中國尙未準備接受之若干項物資爲例外，茲已完成一種制度，規定本署中國分團將根據中國分發物資之能力，逐月規定供應品之運量。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕聯總署長賴伽第亞今日在聯合國大會經濟委員會，以嚴厲與議剌口吻，大聲疾呼：「和平不能存在於飢餓之世界」。並邀請英美至少應接受國際救濟折衷辦法。賴氏並主張由加拿大草擬此項折衷方案。賴氏稱：世界主要捐輸糧食國家，對於未來救濟步驟意見分歧，實爲最不幸之事，救助濟工作非意見一致不爲功。</p>
<h3>加拿大主設專委會　以代替聯總之地位　聯大經財委會一致通過</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖七日電〕關於加拿大所提出之建議，主張於來年內設立一專家委員會，以代替聯總之地位，頃由聯合國大會經濟財政委員會開會，提出討論，當即獲得一致通過。按美國前此曾提出一項計劃，主張救濟事宜，應由「有」的國家與「無」的國家直接商定。聯總署長賴伽第亞亦曾提出一項建議，主張設立一國際救助濟機構，目下加拿大之計劃，實爲一種折衷解決辦法，其中規定任命專家八人，組織專家委員會，自本年十二月卅一日起，開始代理聯總在歐洲所負之責任，自來年三月卅一日起，開始接收聯總在亞洲所負之責任。該項計劃若能獲得聯合國機構之最後批准，則專家委員會將負担下列各項責任：即（一）確定匱乏國家在一九四七年內所必需進口之最少限度之食糧，及其他主要物品，俾防止其經濟崩潰；（二）確定各該國家繳付其進口貨物所必需之外匯；（三）起草一項報告書，提出適當之方法，以供給各該國家充分之基金，用以償付其該國家充分之基金，用以償付其進口貨物。至於英美兩國，曾單獨供給聯總救濟物資百分之九十二，故截至目前爲止，仍堅決拒絕參加賴伽第署他說所提議之國際救濟機構，蓋以英美兩國希望能自行決定對於何種國家將予以救濟故也。此在另一方面，賴伽第亞要求新的國際救濟機構，應僅僅以匱乏國家之需要與食糧剩餘國家之能力爲其決議之基礎，而分配救濟物資。據經濟財政委員會英國代表威爾斯，於該會散會後，語法國新聞社記者稱：英國對於加拿大所提出之折衷計劃，願爲其後盾，此在美國代表團某代表則謂：專家委員會若能僅以顧問團體之資格而行事，則美國政府對之並不表示異議，經濟財政委員會定於九日將加拿大所提出之計劃正式提付表決，目下似已獲得聯合國機構五下四公員國全體之擁護。</p>
<h3>英黎明號巡艦　將移交我國</h3>

<h3>深圳血案前前後後　英軍藐視人命損害我主權</h3>
<p>— 本報廣州特派員　梁風</p>
<p>這又是一椿使香港英政府「深覺遺憾」的事情。在王永祥被踢斃的事件還未有結果，十二月三日下午二時左右，在粵港邊境中英交界深圳附近的文錦渡，又發生了英軍越入華界並殺死我農民張添祥的血案，這誠然是最不幸的事件。雖然中英當局，素稱親睦，可惜其屬下的英軍，竟數次違背當局意旨，而亂作妄爲，自勝利以還，彼些間不愉快的事件，已發生不知凡搜，這次英軍越入華界，已屬不合，何况殺人？這對人命還屬事小，而損害我國主權事體實大，這些事件如沒有有一個圓滿解決的辦法，則將來居留在香港，佔香港人口百分之九十八的僑胞的安全，便恐怕更無以保障了。</p>
<p>中英交界血漬斑爛</p>
<p>當事件發生的次晨，記者曾赴當地調查，時郷民雲集，紛紛談着事件的經過，每人都是憤慨激昂，溢於言表。那地方即爲中英分界之處，以深圳河相隔，南爲英界，北爲華界（深圳），中架一木橋，即爲文錦渡橋；橋頭以南，有英軍砲壘二座，時正警戒森嚴，橋側架有機關槍，並停有上架機槍之小型裝甲車一架，均北向華界，聞英軍人數，亦較平時增加，其他軍車往來更覺頻繁，彷彿如臨大敵；惟華界方面，則除三二審警維持秩序，其他並無戒備象徵。距離深圳河北岸三十九·五公尺處，即爲出事之地點，此地距英界過境約八十公尺，死者張添祥之屍身，尙橫陳道左，景象凄凉！那裏恰爲廣九公路旁中國海關木牌之後，木牌上有「停車由海關檢查」等中英文字樣。死者衣黑嗶嘰短衣褲，黃帆布面膠鞋，白襪，頭側有一呢帽，臉上則血漬斑爛，右咀角已厔裂，因子彈是由咀角射入，而從右耳旁穿出的。</p>
<p>母姊痛述死者身世</p>
<p>當時有兩老婦正環坐尺旁失聲痛哭，原來是死者之母姊及姊弟，後來從她們的口裏，說出了一此死者的身包：</p>
<p>死者張添祥，年二十九歲，是深圳河附近的向西村人·父名張才，營鮮魚和鹹魚買賣，當張添祥十六歲時，即以積勞成疾棄世，從此便要他負起家庭的重担；他家裏有五十五歲的老母，和大姊阿娥，妹子張合，還有一個十六歲的弟弟張有，都靠他一人做些小買賣來過活；他幼時也曾在深圳墟一所蒙館唸過兩年書，到父親死了便輟學，日軍侵進深圳進，人們居住的房屋都給放火燒掉，他携老帶幼到元朗山下村蓋起茅屋暫居，因爲憤於日軍的殘暴，便瞞着母親投到游擊隊裏去，過了四年的槍林彈雨生活，把敵人騷擾得疲於奔命，到勝利後才搬回他們的家鄉；誰又想到幾年來的危險日子都可以平安渡過，到今天才會這樣來寃枉犧牲掉呢？今天後他們這數口之家，更不知向誰倚靠了！</p>
<p>英軍兇蠻令人髪指</p>
<p>關於這事件的發生經過是這樣：三日下午二時，有約十三四歲之小童二名，携有約二斤重之白糖二包（有謂係麺粉）自新界步回深圳，行經英軍檢查哨位前，英軍竟謂其爲「走私」，小童見了英國大兵，心中懼怕，便自文錦渡橋，拔足向深圳狂奔，詎該英軍究追不捨，竟携械越橋入華境內，將兩小童抓着痛歐一頓，當時在旁之鄉民睹狀，鼓噪不已，因此引起爭執，變方言語隔閡，誤會益深；後來中國海關的江君聞訊，因他諳熟英語，便上前調整解，知該英軍名麥羅拔（Mac　Robart）少尉階級，係駐守邊境之四十五營金冕多隊小隊長；江上前調解時，初亦遭驅逐，後悉爲海關人員始不爲已甚，江即責其不應携械越界，然該英軍竟謂：「沿深圳河以北一百碼之地，皆英國領土，余不特可隨時來此，且可……」一時我民衆越聚越多，見其兇蠻之狀，均極髪指；而該英軍更老羞成怒，立即奔回英界兵房，一會兒即聞槍聲砰砰，彈自英界方面飛來，連發六七響，於是羣集橋頭之鄉民，即紛紛奔避，張添祥因躲避不及，遂應聲倒斃；此一不幸事件，亦即由此而開始。</p>
<p>當地長官提出交涉</p>
<p>事發後當地深圳鎭長袁志超，警察所長林萬年及憲兵團十六團連長魯愼等，均聞訊先後馳至，並向英駐軍提出交涉及。但麥羅拔竟極力否認其人爲英軍擊斃，謂英軍曾放槍二響，爲三〇三號子彈，如死者中此種子彈始足爲證；我方即答以子彈已脫屍身而出，何由辨認，大可集合全體英兵一騐其槍，即知槍爲誰發，麥斯時無詞以對。其後英警司此地路及一英軍上校亦已趕至，我方遂續與交涉，英方初仍欲推諉，後經指證，始承認謂「此事不幸發生，我等應負全責，惟宜各報上峯，聽候判奪」。我方以其旣已承認責任，乃可除圖交涉，遂即退回華界，這是當時最初交涉之情形。</p>
<p>民衆團體　緊急會議</p>
<p>是時當地鄉民紳耆及各民衆團體領袖，聞悉此事，咸爲憤激；即在深圳小學內召開一緊急鉣議，並即成立了「深圳各界反對英軍越境慘殺張添祥後援會」，以當地十三個社團爲該會委員。記者曾訪晤該會主委張振英氏，據謂：「此次英兵橫蠻無理，竟持槍越境殺人，匪特我鄉民張添祥無辜慘死，且實對我國體絕大之侮辱，茍不將兇懲處，則今天後無以保障我國人之生命財產，故彼等代表全縣十萬民衆，誓爲後盾，竭其全力，務求達到勝利爲止。」該會當日議決之重要案有數則：（一）籨請政府向英當局交涉，將行兇隊兵交我政府嚴辦懲處（二）撫卹死者遺族（三）促請政府收回九龍香港（四）在該案未獲完滿解決前，請政府交涉駐守文錦渡英軍撤離邊界五英里。該會當日便即派出主課煦華（實安縣臨參會秘書）鄭啓昌（實安縣建設科長）二人爲代表，連夜趕至香港向我兩廣外交特派員郭德華報告事件經過。並於四日來穗，分別報告此間黨政軍當局及參議會等，籲請當局採取有效辦法保護人民生命。現此間民衆團體已決議一致聲援。有廿六團體於五日聯名發出通電：籲請國大代表向大會提出，請國民政府積極交涉收回香港，九龍，澳門，以維領土主權。而粵省民衆，更無不充滿悲憤激昂之情緒。</p>
<p>港方公報　前後互異</p>
<p>至於香港當局，在事件發生之後，次日香港官方發表消息稱：「五日下午四時，新界邊境文錦渡橋脚華界地方，有便衣華人十餘名，在該處攔截交通施行檢查，其背後站立武裝中國軍警，但無行動，英界主面守軍一士兵，過橋擬探問眞相，但被喝逐退回，該士兵退守英崗位後，不知因何誤扳槍機，槍聲一響，即見對岸發生騷動，繼聞有人受傷，華方警官隨即到英界交涉，該士兵未奉開槍，英軍當局於事發後即將該士兵扣留，予以嚴辦。」同日期港英陸軍總部四日公布稱：「三日九龍新界邊境守軍士兵一名，開槍射出三〇三子彈一枚，當時調查證實其係誤發。據華方當局報告：該彈擊殺一站在華界方面之中國平民，此事件刻由軍事當局澈查中，同時英軍當局對該死者之慘死，完全負責，並深感遺憾。」祇此兩個英官方消息，已前後略有出入。現此事件經我兩廣外交特派員郭德華之交涉，已由港英陸軍司令費斯丁將軍答復，除作口頭道歉以外，並提出三項保證：（一）賠償損失，（二）嚴懲兇手，（三）保證今後再無同樣栆年發生。現敦特派員爲審愼起見，正詳細調查全案情形，並搜集資料向中央報告後，然後再向港府當局提出書面正式交涉。（編者按：郭特派員之報告已寄至外交部，我方之正式照會亦已於七日送達港方，消息均見八日本報。又關於本案，另有本報香港特約記者通訊稿一篇，將在明日第九版刋載。）</p>
<p>論專</p>
<h3>首都教育</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>這一年來，我們極留心各市的教育，綜合各方的報導，只有二可以形容，一爲「退」，一爲「亂」。後方的市教育是退，退步得不像樣子，收復區的市教育是亂，淆亂得可怕。我們不禁在「教育第一」的口號下戰慄。大家知道國家前途寄託下一代身上，而建國棟樑的培養則完全仰賴於各級教育，可是實際上無法，也無人來改善當前的退步和淆亂的局面。</p>
<p>南京市教育當然也逃不出亂，天天在　兒童換學，教員失業，放了校長開不出學校，開了學校區公所硬不肯搬塲等等現象。然而南京市教育局，畢竟是首都的教育局，他們在這種局面下，尙能有什么麼生機，儘量加以培養；有什麼瘡疤，更快快加以修補；最近咬緊牙關，草擬了一册三年計劃書，以期普及國民教育，掃除全市文肓，並改進各級教育素質，作整個教育的合理設施，前天邀請了當地專家，討論了足足半天，確是空谷佳音，值得注意的一件事。因爲首都教育不是練粹市的教育，而有全國性的教育，同時它的影響也不僅及於南京一市。</p>
<p>南京現爲政治中心地位，我們希望南京不祇是政治中心地位，同時還該成爲教育專業中心地位，這不但爲與東南教育，乃爲東南教育建中心。北平向有「文化市」「學生市」之稱，學校和學生之外，圖書館等設備豐富，全國各都會，無出其右。不久的南京至少該比得上北平，目前東南教育中心還在上海，但上海係一個通商口岸，究非教育中心之地。</p>
<p>一旦南京成爲新教育區，新文化市，其利甚多，南京山川雄傳龍蹯虎踞，爲帝皇建都之地，富於史跡，教育要發揚愛國意識，提介民族團結，是則河山之愛好，歷史之迴顧，最爲重要。上海浸潤歐化，市儈氣太重，俗傾享樂，倘入窮苦京市，過大多數同胞的簡樸生活，雖欲頹廉奢侈而不能。南京爲國府所在，政治中心，政治本身即是教育，早夕沐化其間，自能習染民主風度，并知國是的難難，何况京市枕大江，城廓廣大，腥地遼闊，地位適中，交通便利，在「東南財賦地，江浙人文蔽」的情况下，儘有自由擴展建設教育的機會。</p>
<p>首都教育最不易辦，實在也最易辦，欲實現教育事業中心地位，不是地方所能負担，但也不是中央所獨能經營，必須彼此聯緊合作才克成功。大規模的教育機構如天文館，水族館，圖書館，博物館，藝術院專科以上學校等，槪歸中央辦，一般的社會教育學校教育當然讓地方負責，可是地方稅收有限，象現在的情形，拿南京整個的收入維持目前每月四億八千餘元的教育費，已是捉襟露肘的窮相，怎能談得上改進＝善或發展，勢非國庫大量補助不可，事實上南京市教育的對象不是眞南京人，不要說別的，中央公務員子弟便佔很多，籍貫遍全國，中央應拿錢出來是天經地義。否則又要馬兒跑得好，又要馬兒不吃草，天下沒有這樣便宜的事。</p>
<p>據局長報告：現有國民學校一一六所，一〇二〇班，學童約六一二〇〇，私立小學三二所，約一六五班，學童九〇〇，實際上所需二一六校，二四二〇班，三年經費要四九·七八八·五〇〇·四八〇元，該市文肓三六四·八六九人，需要初級成人班初級婦女班五·四〇〇，高級的要六四〇〇班，三年所需經費共八·九二一·一八二·二四〇元。該市有二歲以上未滿六歲的幼兒約五〇·〇〇〇，假定三分之一入學，則要幼兒班和嬰兒班各一二二三班，需經費三年內共一九·一〇九·〇二五·六八〇元。初級中學十一所二四〇班，高中九所一〇八班。三年經費共一五·五七五·九二四·四八〇元。此外再加幼教民教育機構·職校·研究和行政等費，勢非三萬八千六百萬以上不辦。</p>
<p>計進的數字除慮及可靠性和可變性外，我們覺得與其嫌多，不如嫌少，人口，幣值，市面，學校收費等都屬問題。這計劃對我們很感興趣，因爲它是全國性且具有示範性，不妨一論。該計劃涉及物質的多精神的少，所謂精神，即是哲學，即是理想。京市有它的通性，有它的個性，更有它的特性，固然，教育亦必切合於實際始，不致流於空談，但教育有適應地方的深刻哲學和遠大理想，庶可引導實施活動於最高境域。</p>
<p>學前兒童的强調創辦，眞是難能可貴，這就是教育進步的地方。戰前全世界有七萬萬人口中已滿五歲的兒童共一四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇，他們還沒有强迫教育的法令，已有法令而失敗的達三五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人口，五歲以下規定强迫教育的要讓羅馬亞·比國三歲至六歲兒童入學的佔百分之六六，法佔百分之五二，瑞士爲百分之五〇，意爲百分之三〇，美國幼稚園共五〇〇·〇〇〇所，幼兒院在一九三二年祇十二所，隔了二年，一躍而爲三千所，現在更不知多少了。計劃中嬰兒班幼兒班，是不是託兒班和幼兒班的分別，因爲嬰兒學校是同一年齡的學校，不過前者爲英國所樂道，後者係美國所常稱，初無什麼區別。再若能以班改爲獨立的院所等，則列爲上策了。這種教育的師資應特別在保育方面培養，非一般教師所能勝任的。</p>
<p>三年內所佈置的中學數量還嫌少，如果能做到新教育區，中學生應大量增設。各國義務教育的年限，大教超過了初等教育而進展到中等教育階段。英已延長到十五歲，并擬提高至十六歲。法爲十四歲。蘇聯在第三次五年計劃開始時，即擬在城市普及十年義教。日自一九四一年起，亦將義教由六年改爲倣年，凡此情形對於中等教育的普及，供給一個有利條件。中等教育的門戶開放，自然會吸收大量的平民子弟，我們普及中等教育，硬是要着眼邱吉爾一句話：「將來的世界屬於受了高等教育的種族，祇有他們能掌握新科學的工具」。</p>
<p>康樂園和療養學校等確實急需，而且不能囿於一種，簡單的露天學校，林間學校，夏令營，假期營，都可省錢的辦理。家事學校對女子太重要了，該校注重「公共衛生」的一點，不如改爲「各種衛生」，因爲家庭中孕婦的胎養，嬰兒和兒童的衛生，以及營養，較公共衛生更切要，更實際。並通師資訓練應側重生活教育和技能教育，務使授教即是授業，小學每個級任要人人會教體育，會辦衛生教育，會自製標本，會修電燈收音機等等。道德薰陶，處人心陷溺的今天世，尤其不可少，荀子修身篇曰：「夫師以身爲正儀而貴自安者也」，勸學篇又曰，「是故權利不能傾也，羣衆不能移也，天下不能蕩也，生乎由是，死乎由是」：必須要這樣才配稱爲教師。至於視導，萬不能全賴督學視察或中心學校，絕對絕對要由校長多負責任，校長百分之七十的時間應作　導。爲民族子弟選校長，當然是一件隆重嚴肅的大事，而行政簡化，讓校長少跑跑教育衙門，多走走課室，亦未始厞爲教育上作一椿革命的事。</p>

<h3>蘇省大江南北公路橋梁狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江訊〕蘇省大江南北公路，自復員後一年來，其整個概况，尙少有系統之報道，記者以各方對此事殊極關懷，特走訪省公路局工務科長　宗周，暢談　一小時許始畢，茲將江南及江北兩方面公路橋樑狀况，綜合叙述於後：</p>
<p>江南</p>
<p>由句容至武進，江陰·無錫·蘇州·崑山·太倉·上海·係分兩個階段辦理，由句容至武進一段橋樑壞的甚多，其間一共有橋樑三十幾座　，惟尙可勉强通車，所有橋樑擬改建洋灰橋面。由江陰至無錫一段甚好，由句容至鎭江有六座橋樑，其長的五十幾公尺，現有兩橋正在開始動工，約二十幾公尺，其他四橋擬改建永久式。由鎭江至武進間共有橋樑廿二座，計畏二百零一十公尺，現準備將十七個橋做永久式，短期內即將開工，其他五橋用木式做。武進至江陰一段，計共十三橋，原是木橋，破壞甚厲害，現車子經過時非常困難，目前因經費關係，擬整個全部重新改做木面。江陰至武進一段，係由商家專營辦理，其養路護路工秘，在局方監督下成績尙好。由無錫至蘇州·崑山·太倉一段，最近正積極着手趕修，無錫至善人橋一段有五橋將開工，其長有七十四公尺，全部橋面之修理，在最近十天內可以完工。蘇州至崑山間有兩座橋，計長九十六公尺，現已開工，短期內可以完成。崑山至太倉間有九座橋樑，約長一百公尺，現有五座橋已開始興修。由句容至鎭江之路面，現亦準備重新開始興築。由金壇至天王寺·溧水等一帶，計共有十九座橋樑，目前均需要從頭做起，材料已準備齊全，即將動工，的於二三月內即可修好。武進至漕橋間有三座橋，即將開工。據劉科長鄭重表示謂：江蘇在八年抗戰期中，遭受破壞極大，以今日江蘇經濟環境言，只能逐一舉辦，而江蘇省河流縱橫，當視其急迫需要，分別去做。</p>
<p>江北</p>
<p>浦口至六合·儀征·揚州·泰興·南通·呂四港等地，原屬國道，前因配合軍車進展，曾由本局隨時組織搶修隊前往搶修沿路破壞橋樑路面，因軍事關係，顧及到迅速，就難以顧及到好，最近泰興到靖江·石莊，因其軍事尙朱停止，故尙未通，另外由南通到如　海安，由海安到泰縣仙女廟，再由泰縣到口岸，泰興到黃　間有十幾座橋樑，近將開始重新建造，由仙女廟到實應一段，計共有三座橋，現正開始建造，短期內可興工。最後據渠表示，蘇北的公路橋樑，離現實理想尙遠。</p>

<h3>如何剷除二房東</h3>
<p>本市屋荒，政府已在積極籌劃，而市參議會亦在盡力探討，以求澈底解決，關心民瘼，殊深欽佩。筆者不諳法律，今就以觀感所及討論之。</p>
<p>我國治外法權及租界尙未收回之前，上海工部局，因市民五方雜處，一室數家，爲圖管理上之便利，（如捐稅之徵收等）始有二房東三房客之名義。其時房租不昻，二房東均不注重分租利益，乃得久安。迨本市爲敵倭侵陷，仍沿舊習，令一房東爲戶長，負責監視三房客，以防制反動，加以難民至滬日衆，房租隨生活漸高，屋少人多，二房東以有勢可借，有利可牟，其乘機崛起者，樓上架閣，露臺築屋，弄底搭棚，以及客堂廚房一律招租，高抬租價，强索頂費小租，無微不至。但受此實惠者，係二房東，業主則無權干涉焉。未幾，敵僞限制二房東利益爲原租金百分之二十，當懾於淫威，稍歛其翼，房租雖未能盡如　限制，因所加不多，糾紛尙少，然強索頂費小租，則如故也。至勝利後，政府深知民隱，於民三十四年十二月五日有上海市房屋租賃管理規則之公布，其第十一條五項；「承租人（二房東）未爲改良裝置而分程房屋，其所取租金，超過原租金之比例百分之三十者，出租人（即業主）有權終止其租賃。」（筆者按政府規定二房東利益，以爲有房捐，修理，與電之補貼等支出，顧二房東絕未負担也，試觀將本求利者，其號稱駭人之暗息，猶不過一角五分。而二房東不費一文，可得三角厚息。「百分之三十，適等於暗息三角。」尙不知足，假使减爲百分之五，已較銀行活存爲大矣。）則業主理應推行法令，以解三房客之倒懸，而自闢增租之途徑。（三房客如能不受二房東之重重剝削，業主或欲增租似較容易。）捨此不岡，時機竟爲二房東所操縱，視法令爲具文，置而不顧。依吾目睹耳聞，其能適應環境，不貪此法定利益，與三房客平均分担支出者固有之，惜如鳳毛麟角寥寥無幾，其不遵法令而惟利是圖者，實繁有徒。（須佔百分之九十以上，均不負捐電修理資任。）於分租部分所取之租金，比原租金超過百分之一百，或二百，甚至有五六百倍者，洵屬駭人聽聞。於是業主爲收支不能平衡而呼籲增租，三房客以不勝担負而求减租，祇有二房東透視業主之無能爲，大膽做去。旣收優越租金，復　鉅大頂費，運籌自若，左右逢源，社會上之能不勞而獲，坐享厚利者，其惟現代化之二房東矣，然亦業主之權旁落，有以造成之也。</p>
<p>我國戶籍法，各戶均由家長各自負責，本市戶口調査鑼制，及複査戶籍登記，已經完成，絕不如租界與敵僞時代之欲二房東爲領袖，而負如何責任。故二房東於政府，於人民（三房客）已無地位可言，且房屋之租賃糾紛，咎旣不在業主，更不在三房客，實由二房東之居奇重利，障礙於其間。以此二房東一日不剷除，房屋租賃糾紛亦一日不能解決，則握　有包辦制租賃權者之亟須取銷，豈惟不容或緩，且爲低减市民生活之一要素也。筆者乃於公餘草擬管見焉：</p>
<p>（一）房租亟待糾正　二房東之收取房租，須如業主塡填給房票。（房票可分承租分租兩種，房票註明路里弄號，與區保甲戶，以及月租數目，承租人姓，名等，由管理機關製售之。）規定其利益爲百分之五，更由管理機關嚴定罰則，製造房租調査表，委托保田發給二房東，（無分租者不發）限令與三房客分別實塡，再經業主蓋章，（二房東所填，與業主房票金額是否相符。）然後送請保甲轉達管理機關審査，（該表經過一次塡報，每於房租重行調整後，限十日內再塡報之。）若其利益有超過規定者，該管機關應即通知業主終止其租賃權，直接管理，但仍許其租住，對於所收超過之租金返還外；並視其超過數量之多寡，分等處罰，三房客如有虛報亦罰之。</p>
<p>（二）私頂嚴厲制止據三十五年八月十日報載「房屋租賃兩項法規第四條，「出租人除收租金外，不得以任何名義　，收取頂費小租，違反者，經査實後，委員會得令出租人將不法之費用返還之，並得對出租人處罰鍰」，云云。於情於法，自應處罰出租人。（法規所指出租人，或係包括業主與二房東）。但本市舊空屋甚少，業主之收取頂費者，僅新屋，容或有之，數亦寥寥，且政府因屋荒獎勵建築，故係另一問題。而一般出頂者，均爲二房東，（即承租人）其頂費皆係金條現鈔，由何而能査實之，况出頂人他遝後，鴻飛冥冥，弋者何慕？以此科罰，必須側重於受頂人，或與出頂人共同處罰。如出項人無從傳訊，應限令受頂人追尋到案，若不依限追到，受頂人須受併科。然業主或經租人收受過戶費用，而不檢舉，則縱有法規，亦等具文，是以制止之道。不在科罰，而在公證焉。</p>
<p>凡二房東三房客之欲全家他遷者，須於十五日前，聲請遷出，並附函申報遷出確定日期，一併送達保甲，由保甲通知業主或二房東，至該管辦公處解的。（如係二房東遷出，即由業主直接管理，）同時業主或二房東，應即預先公吿招租。（載明空屋閱數，面積，押租與租金數自，地址，及該管保甲辦公處塲所等。）如有自願租賃者，可先覓舖保，（即保租人）同至該管保田處登記，（租賃權以先登記者得之。）代辦租的，（租的及租屋登記册，由管理機關製售，並限期公吿，私訂租的在限期以後者無效。）介至業主或二房東處繳款，完成租賃手續。並須依照保田規則，聲請遷入後，始得遷居。（筆者按鄉間田畝房屋之買賣，均經過保甲公證，酌收相當手續費；查本市保甲編制雖已完成，過半因絀於經濟，碍難推進，今盍仿行，以充實保甲經費。）而辦理房屋租賃人員，若私索款項，査明後，依法嚴究。（筆者按旣係公吿招租，賃屋者自不願例外耗費，則代辦租賃人員，亦不能强索費用不遂。而拒絕登記，加以重重監視，即欲行賄，恐亦無受之者矣。）</p>
<p>（三）管理務求簡易　業主直接管理，若嫌多造房票，收租費時等麻煩，則於押租及保租人外，可令租客用連環保租方式，按月輪舉代表收租，至業主處自繳。如遇屋空並負帮問招租責任。若以自繳爲不妥，或添雇人負辦理，酌加房票材料及收租手續費，想租客旣免二房東之重重剝削，似無不允之理，且日後屋荒解決，而無二房東窒碍。決不致全屋皆空，與業主亦有利焉。（直道）</p>

<h3>魯易斯顧全國家大局　美煤礦工潮結束　準備與政府及礦主商訂新合同　杜魯門臨時取消廣播</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕礦工聯合會主席魯易斯今日突然結束烟煤礦工潮，屈服於最高法院與總統所將採取之行動。魯氏已通知四十萬礦工，依照政府合同規定之工資及其他條件立即復工，並要求談判新合同。拖延十七日之工潮一旦終止，美國岌岌可危之經濟，因之得有喘息之餘地。魯易斯怱促召集新聞記者，以其慣用之戲劇性作風，宣讀對礦工之通吿，宣布立即復工，其時期至少至明年三月爲止。魯氏事前聲明將親向礦工宣讀通吿，俾使各記者得知，「此乃余今日本善良信念自動出此。至其動機如何，純屬揣測。若干哲學家嘗謂追求動機，爲世界上最不可能捉摸之事」。</p>
<p>但有兩項事實頗爲明顯：（一）杜魯門廣播演說，似超越魯易斯而向礦工直接呼籲，同時又傳若　干礦工業已復工。（二）魯易斯之蔑視法令案，已向最高法院上訴，最高法院如維持原判，則礦工聯會繼續蔑視法令，有加重處罰之可能。魯易斯宣布取消罷工前三小時，政府與工會雙方律師曾與最高法院首席法官文森秘密會談。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約七日電〕美國煤礦罷工以來，紐約市與全國廿一州實行節電運動，减少燈光，全國頓時一片黯淡景象。礦工聯合會主席魯易斯今日午後宣布工潮結束後，全國燈光限制取消。紐約市長宣布：百老匯大街又可燈炬通明，民用生產管理局亦通令廿一州州長立即取消　燈光限制辦法。同時，鐵路貨運客運之限制均已撤銷，煤斤出口令亦可取消。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統原定八日廣播演說，直接呼召礦工復工，但今日午後工潮突然結束，故總統演說臨時作罷。今日午前白宮發言人猶稱，總統忙於準備演說無暇見客。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕魯易斯結束工潮於珍珠港事變第五週年之日，尤爲巧合。罷工結束消息爲下午二時發表，珍珠港事變消息之傳播亦於一九四一年十二月七日下午二時開始，魯易斯宣布所以採取此種行動，志在使最高法院自由審理，不受經濟危機所促成之公共壓力之影響　。魯氏要求依照最高法院判決，與政府或礦主談判新合同。</p>
<p>歐洲大爲興奮</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕美國煤礦工潮結束，消息傳來，歐洲大爲興奮。因罷工影響所及，足使美國對歐洲之食物，燃料與機械工具出口陷於停頓。英國方面已警吿减少食物配給，德國方面多數人均在半飢餓狀態。深恐配給再减少。</p>
<h3>德國問題開始討論　美蘇兩國各提建議　任命專任代表聆取他國見解　限制佔領軍額意見未趨一致</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約七日電〕四强外長今日曾討論有關德國問題之兩項主要問題，即在本屆外長會議與下屆外長會議間，任命專任代表審議德國問題，及聆取他國之意見。每一外長均就如何討論德國問題一點，提出意見。莫洛托夫與其他三外長就是否應於目前即設立專任代表委員會以聆取意見，或待諸下屆外長會譏舉行以後始行設立一點，意見不能一致。貝爾納斯及貝文均認小國已因在討論德附庸國和的時於外長會議成立基本決議後始允彼等發表意見而不滿，故此次若接受莫洛托夫之建議，使專任代表於獲得外長會之指令後始行聆取他國意見，不免招致他國同樣之不滿，貝文外相須早退前赴華盛頓，故今日之會談就任命專任代表委員會之問題，仍未成立協議常於星斯一繼續討論。</p>
<p>美國建議</p>
<p>貝爾納斯所提下屆外長會議之建議案如下：（一）外長會議應任命專任代表，審議德國問題。（二）專任代表在外長會議成立任何決議前，應聆取荷·比·丹·捷·波蘭·南斯拉夫·盧森堡及其他願意陳述意見各國之見解，作爲外長會議正式向各國徵詢以前之初步陳述。（三）柏林盟國管制委員會應就下列諸點向外長會議提出報吿：（甲）德國臨時政府之形式及範圍，（乙）在盟管會下有關德國未來政治經濟之各項問題。（四）對奧和的。（五）限制駐歐佔領軍。（六）下屆會議之時期及地點。下屆會議議程應包括：（甲）德國未來之疆界，包括薩爾區之處置，（乙）德國之繼續解除武裝，美國建議以條約及其他必要措施以規定德國未來之經濟及軍事管制，（丙）設立中央機構，（丁）德臨時政府，（戊）對德和的槪要，（已）對奧和的，（庚）限制佔領軍，（辛）其他已議定之事項。</p>
<p>蘇聯建議</p>
<p>莫洛托夫所提建議如下：（一）屆外長會議應討論德奧和的，（渠未曾指出日期惟在討論時曾建議於二月下半月在莫斯科舉行）。（二）該會議程應爲：（甲）柏林盟管會就自波茨坦會議以來關於解除武裝實施民主，經濟原則及賠款等部份工作之報告。（乙）德國之中央行政機構及有關未來德政府之問題。（丙）德國和約之準備，討論程序，專任代表之任命，外長會議對各該代表所發之基本指令。（丁）對奧和的之準備。（戊）普魯土之淸理，由盟管會提出報告。（己）煤礦專家委員會之報告。（庚）請盟管會於下屆外長會議開會前之兩星期提出有關議徎各項之報吿。</p>
<p>在討論時貝爾納斯表示願同意將煤礦專家報吿及普魯士之淸理等兩項列入議程，美蘇兩草案大體均相同，唯一之例外，即爲限制佔領軍之問題，貝爾納斯關於限制歐洲佔領軍之建議，有謂爲便於恢復歐洲和平起見，俟與德國附庸國之條約簽訂後，盟國駐歐軍應有數量上之限制。貝氏主張自明年四月一日起，歐洲方面各國駐軍最高額如下：德國方面，美軍不得超過十四萬人，英軍十四萬人，法軍七萬人，蘇軍二十萬人。奧國方面，美英蘇法各不得超過二萬人。蘇聯並得在波蘭駐二萬人，在匈牙利駐五千人，並在羅馬尼亞駐五千人。</p>

<h3>截軍小組遭遇難關</h3>
<p>癥結仍在否決權</p>
<p>〔聯　社成功湖七日電〕裁軍問題小組會今日因軍備管制機關獨立問題，巳吿擱淺。蘇聯代表維辛斯基堅持兩個管制機關應在安全理事會下直接活動，適用否決權條文。美國代表康納利則堅持管制機關應獨立。蘇聯原已同意在管制機關內部不使用否決權，但堅持任何事件由安理會考慮時適用否決權。此一問題經四小時辯論後，交由起草委員會審議，於九日提出報吿。</p>
<h3>聯大辯論印度申訴　歷時之久出意外</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕聯合國大會星期六討論印度申訴南非虐待印僑事，歷時之久，出乎意外，猶無結論，致英國企圖爭取大會核准國際監察　，調査各國軍隊報吿是否確實，已因此展延至星期日討論。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於晚間始偕主要隨員三人到達弗魯辛草地出席大會，時英方已宣佈其提出上項建議之新舉動。印度之申訴，顯將有長期辯論，莫洛托夫乃提出決議案，謂此申訴於星期六夜大會中，不能辯論終結。</p>

<h3>美重申對西政策　拒與弗朗哥絕交　聯大政治委會小組通過決議　不準其參加聯合國任何機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播：美代表康納利今日在政治小組會議中鄭重聲明：美國在任何情形下，決不與弗朗哥斷　絕外交關係，用時亦不贊同對西班牙實施經濟制裁。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖七日電〕聯大政治委會小組會頃通過美國修正後之建議案，促聯合國全體大會建議，不使弗朗哥政府參加由聯合國機構所設或與其有關之機構，並不許該政府參加聯合國機構或其所屬機構之會議或其他活動，直至西班牙成立可被接受之新政府爲止。</p>

<h3>蒂托向英國要求勿收留國王彼得</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦七日電〕政界消息靈通人士頃談稱：南斯拉夫總理蒂托元帥，業已要求英政府拒絕南國王彼得留居英境之權。南斯拉夫法庭將宣布彼得王爲戰爭罪犯，衆信蒂托元帥殆亦已向法國及瑞士兩國提出同樣要求，但南國君主派人士對於此等傳說，尙不能予以證實。外交界人士認爲英政府函覆蒂托元帥時，將說明各國政治逃亡者在傳統上有留居英國之權利。</p>
<h3>我向聯大提議永禁日本製毒　遠東設管制毒品國際機構</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖七日電〕聯合國社經理事會所設麻醉品委會今日開會，討論永遠禁止日本製毒辦法，以免其再度毒害東方人民。中國代表謝博士提議在遠東設立麻醉品國際倉庫，在聯合國管制下，但任麻醉劑之製造與分配。日本如欲輸入麻醉品，非經由該倉庫不可，關於此點，必須包括在未來對日和平條約之內。埃及代表提出補充案，主張在其他地點尤其是近東，另設倉庫一處。美代表亦提議設立國際機關，由聯合國社經理事會草成特別憲章。荷代表發表意見，反對上述各項計劃，主張僅在日本本土設置聯合國監督處，監督麻醉品進口。麻醉品出產國家領得監督處執照，即可以麻醉品運入日本。中國代表同意埃及與美國之　意見，但不贊成荷蘭之提議，認爲不足以有效抵抗毒禍。</p>
<h3>倫敦圓桌會議失敗　英軍不擬撤離印度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦七日電〕英印回三方面圓桌會議宣吿失敗之後，頃據英國軍界人士談稱：除非印度有充分之軍隊足以保護其邊界，防止任何侵略，否則英國軍隊即不能自印度撤退。英軍在　緊急時期，且得在印度登陸，母需等待英印兩國政府談判之結果。此在英國政界人士則謂：英國軍隊在印度未召開國民議會保障印度各民族所有份子之權利以前，決不自印度撤退。英國竭誠盼望印回雙方能成立協議，但其他少數民族之權利，在英軍一旦撤退之後，均應予以保護。保守黨將以此一問題提交下議院討論。至於印度基督教徒問題，則勢將更受重視，　因約克　大主教（英國國教最高權威之一）對於英軍自印度撤退，認爲時機尚未成熟，故已表示抗議。下議院現定於下星期討論印度問題，日期可能爲本月廿一日。</p>

<h3>法參院舉行複選　人民共和黨地位或可增強</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎七日電〕法國定於明日由最近選出之選舉人的八萬九千名，選舉參議院三百十五席議員中之三百席。此一選舉，不免又爲共黨與人民共和黨之競爭。共黨自謂在三百席中，可獲六十至七十席，而人民共和黨則信在若千省之右翼黨，將放棄彼等之候選人而選人民共和黨，故後者所獲席數可望超過共黨。選舉於晨八時開始，至下午四時截止，結果均須至深夜始能獲悉。</p>
<h3>史達林臥病　謎底仍未揭曉</h3>
<p>蘇駐英使館鄭重否認</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦特派員八日電〕蘇聯駐英大使館今對英報所傳史達林已病逝或將病逝，鄭重予以否認。據稱史氏現仍康健如常。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕今日倫敦各報均在顯著地位登載蘇聯元首史達林病重之傳說，但無一報紙能負責說明史氏在何處生病及所患何病。惟史達林目前並不參加莫斯科或其他地點之任何　官方活動，已有相當時日。此一事實，爲各報所注意與評論。「星期紀事報」昨夜用電話詢問此問蘇聯大使館，要求證實或否認蘇聯元首逝世之傳說。答復電話之官員稱：渠聽得此項傳說，但不能加以證實。</p>

<h3>十五層大廈充滿人肉焦味　美旅館大火　百餘人葬身火窟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社喬奇亞洲亞倫蒂亞七日電〕此間鬧市桃樹街溫考夫旅館十五層大厦，今晨黎明前發生大火旅客二百八十五人中，至少有一百廿人葬身火窟。男女客人與兒童聞警失聲呌喊，或被灼死，或跳棋跌死，亦有因窒息而死者受傷者至少一百人。起火處在第三或第四層樓，經由扶梯與電梯迅速向上延燒，樓上旅客陷於火圈。多數人立於陽台，待救不及，冒險躍下，一部份跌入救火會所張之網中，但因高處落下力量過重，網均脫手，一部份住客，緊閉房門，不使烟火穿入，竟免於難。亦有用被單結成繩索，沿窗而下。有一婦女自六層樓陽臺跳下，跌入黑弄而死。火熄後入內參觀，三層樓以上屍體狼　藉，臥床與傢具均燒焦，充滿濃厚人肉焦味。</p>

<h3>艾帥率直否認原子彈出國　未來戰爭爲「超閃電戰」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約七日電〕陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾今日招待報界時，有人發問稱，聯大會美代表康納利最近聲明英國與加拿大得悉原子彈之秘密，是否確實？艾帥遲疑甚久後答稱，美國從未以原子彈或其材料運往英國或其他國家。但艾帥對於英國與加拿大是否能自造原子炸彈一點，則不加說明。艾帥概述新戰爭所將給予全世界之恐怖，略謂，今後數年之武裝衝突，將爲遠距離控制武器之大規模掙扎，此種武器足以瞬息消滅工業中心。在達到此種「超閃電戰時代」以前，參謀部職責所在，必須準備萬一。美參謀部已設立各特別部門，由科學家主持，一切計劃均由彼等設想。聯合國機構若不消滅此種地獄戰爭之恐怖，則全體國家不得不疏散並掩護其一切工業巾心，以避免被一擊摧毀云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕美國名記者皮爾森今日復稱，確有原子彈若干已運至英國北部布儲，惟英國並無爆炸機鈕，故不能使其爆炸。至於不以爆炸機鈕運英，或係爲避免空運途中之危險，或則尙有其他原因。</p>

<h3>江灣爆炸聲未斷　體育塲一部建築傾圯　全庫毀二分之一　損失尙難估計運輸兵死傷失蹤十人　富司令呈報國防部各機會商善後</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後勤總司令部江灣第二軍械備庫第一分庫，自有日下午發生爆炸後，轟轟巨響，夜以繼日，至昨日上午，市區仍清晰可聞。第一補給區司令富文率同該部路副參謀長毛處長等，於昨日上午九時三十分，再往出事地點勘察，市長吳國柏及淞滬警備司令宣　吾等，亦均先後蒞巡視。消防人員更努力施救，爆炸聲至下午已逐漸稀落，因庫內砲彈經一週夜之爆炸，當已大部炸完，僅餘一小部份壓於磚木什物下之底層，當溫度增高至相當程度，仍斷續爆發。消防人員爲避免危險，未敢迫近清除，僅能用救火車不斷以水龍皮帶，引水內灌，俾溫度減底，使剩餘彈藥不再受熱爆炸。</p>
<h3>繞牆巡視一步一驚</h3>
<p>記者於昨日下午二時，再驅車前往出事地點巡視。時天朗氣清，冬陽和煦，倉庫附近一切已復常態，警戒綫亦已完全撤除。四週民房，除玻璃窗受碎裂外，並未見有嚴重損失。離爆炸處數十步爲空軍第二大隊營房，屋頂被彈片轟穿兩洞，室內玻璃窗全部震碎，國和路上後勤部衛生中隊亦落有彈片甚多。</p>
<p>倉庫</p>
<p>所在地前市立運動塲爲橢圓形建築，炸毀部份係自南部滬路正門至國和路體育塲東門之半圓形建築約爲全庫二分之一。據悉庫中北部尙存有巨量彈藥，幸前日開始爆炸時，風向西南，故得未波及，誠爲大幸。炸燬處正門已成頹垣殘壁，破洞櫐櫐，倍極凄凉，右旁圍牆傾圯，看台亦已折斷分離。門前有鐵絲綱隔離，遙望瓦礫堆中仍有白裊裊而起，俄而又聞轟然一聲，又一砲彈爆炸矣。時記者繞牆巡視，繼續又聞兩度爆炸聲，惟炸力均不大，並無火光，僅見濃烟渳漫而已。旋記者又於附近地面抬獲彈片數枚，其一刻有「昭和十五年」字樣。</p>
<h3>逃出十餘傷兵　嚴加審究</h3>
<p>爆炸起因，據出事倉庫附近兵士傳說，在手榴彈搬運之際，正值中午時有一庫兵喊一聲「吃飯了」搬夫聽聞吃飯，心不在焉，即將所負整箱手榴彈任意傾卸，因此與地面撞擊而釀成巨禍。至個傳爆炸尙有其他複雜原因，且有捕獲嫌疑犯之說，則未能證實。記者曾一再向筆勤司令部詢問，仍稱係由於手榴彈爆炸所引起。當時逃出之十餘倉兵，昨日下午已由第一補給區當事令親自嚴加審詰，迄深晚仍在繼續中。</p>
<p>毛森奉令來滬調查</p>
<p>爆炸之聲，迄今晨一時，尙時有所聞。現本市軍警機關正會商善後辦法，補給區富司令並對此次事變眞相繼續調查，一面將詳情呈報國防部請示。據悉首都衛成司令部已派毛森處長於昨晚來滬協助調查云。</p>
<p>五六日後方可入內</p>
<p>至此次軍械彈業究竟被燬若干，現仍無法估計，泰燬庫間，至少亦需五六日之後，始可入內，因恐尙有若干未爆炸之彈築爆炸也。</p>
<h3>庫長失踪　其妻逢人泣訴</h3>
<p>江灣爆炸案之死傷人數，外傳有庫兵一百三十餘人生死不明，茲據記者自後勤司令部方面證實不確。據稱該部駐庫倉兵共有一連，但因庫肉宿舍不够分配，一部份士兵宿兵於離爆炸處相當距離之另一營房內，出事時間因適值中午，當時有兩排士兵已在該營房內用飯，故爆炸處所附近僅兵士一排而已，且因彈葉係逐漸爆炸，故大部份均已逃出，現已查明者，該部死運輸兵一人，傷四人，失蹤五人。此外搬運之挑夫當有數人死亡，另有附近部隊士兵或在營救時或因流彈波及而受傷者數人，至庫長王仁山則迄今下落不明，是否已葬身彈窟，恐非俟爆炸塲清理後，無法分曉。但其妻昨曾在運動塲旁泣訴，謂其夫必已罹難無疑云。</p>

<h3>縮瑟在西北風裏　流浪兒得了救　難童收容所和行總兒童福利股　第一次寒流襲滬搶救二百餘名</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕正當第一次寒流襲擊上海的時候，難童收容所所長周祖望，與「行總」上海分署的兒童福利股負責人，在夜半人靜以後，開出一輛大卡車，到落寞的街頭巷尾，去搜集縮瑟在西北風裏的流浪兒。</p>
<p>橋頭上，牆脚下，汽車旁，弄巷中，垃圾桶裏……這些都是他們棲身的所在。圍着一張草席，整夜與朔風苦鬥！熬不住了。就這樣默默地死去，誰也不會知道。</p>
<p>五個子夜，人們搶救了二百多個兒童，（其中發現已斷氣而送普善山莊的還沒算在裏面）。這許多苦命的孩子，聽說可以到收容所中避風雨時，是跪着連連磕頭謝恩的。</p>
<p>大多數孩子，當他們被載到收容所裏的時候，已經凍剩了一口氣。必須用熱水全身澆淋後，才漸漸後活過來。於是，讓他吃一點東西，洗一個澡，剃去了頭髪，穿上所中的制服，立刻便成了整齊乾凈，有精神，張笑臉的孩子了！</p>
<p>一個月以前，當該所過去受過訓練的難童，列隊向市府獻旗時，吳市長曾經流着淚對他們重複的說：「國家對不起你們！國家對不起你們」！克里浦斯夫人參觀了收容所以後，異常感動，立時答應回到英國以後，爲他們籌募一所學校，和一個工廠！</p>
<p>我們該做些什麼呢？二百餘名的數目，眞是太微小的。當第二次寒流襲擊上海時，將不知會有多少無辜的孩子，在街頭活活地凍死啊！（圖爲得了救以後的許多流浪兒童）</p>

<h3>坦其隆事件後　華僑待遇改善</h3>

<h3>中正東路子彈橫飛　黃浦區中警匪格鬥　羣盜持械刦棉織織廠　職員外歸窺狀生疑報警包圍　原臟奪回三盜逸去兩盜就擒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中正東路三一二號新聲棉織廠，於昨晚六時五十分許，由後門侵入盜匪五名，一持手榴彈，一執快慢機，一握手槍。其中二人在後門把風，餘三盜闖入賬房間，出槍恫嚇，先將賬房手上之金戒一只捋下，繼在賬桌上搜得法幣一百二十萬，置一旅行袋內，交一望風匪徒提携。餘盜正擬登樓洗刧其他物件時，適該廠有一職員由外歸來，甫至後門弄口如側，睹見有二人徘徊門傍，知非善類，遂外出奔報對門黃浦分局。杜王正副分局長據報後，親偕股長李蔭民率領全體便衣幹警，馳往包壓，將把守後門之二盜逮捕，並奪獲　臟。屋中三盜聞警察到來，即攀登屋頂。恐警察跟蹤追捕，爲先發制人計，竟拔槍開放十五槍。警方亦還槍五響。雙方相持約十分鐘後，三盜向西逃逸。匪越屋至三十二號德泰　號上層晒台，翻上灶披間時，被該號老司務張日進將其拘獲。孰知該匪狡猾異常竟僞稱係捕盜之警員。張見其服裝齊整，信以爲眞，乃將其釋放。該盜遂從容離去。至被捕之兩盜帶局偵訊，據供，各張少川·袁榮。張犯前曾　盜自由軍三次，曾被拘入該分局，有案可稽在逃之同黨三盜現由警方跴緝中。</p>

<h3>人力車改裝三輪　未完成酌予展期</h3>
<p>市府批復五項</p>
<p>本市人力車商同業公會，前以本屆淘汰之人力車改裝單人後座三輪車，因時期迫促，及車架尺寸與規定不符，曾向市府請願。茲悉市府對該業提出之前請求五項已逐一批復如後：</p>
<p>（一）改裝車輛因材料及裝置不及，要求延期撤銷已淘汰之人力車牌照一項，爲體恤計，如已在裝配而未完成者，酌予展期，並非槪指一般改裝車輛，均准延期之謂。（二）三輪車之天心一點，必須仍用雙天心，本府爲求行車轉灣安全起見，未使通融。（三）車架中心長度，不超過六十四英寸一點，係指已造成之車架而言，其有現在業已造成之車架，如超過六十英寸而未逾六十四英寸者，經公用局滛員騐明後，始准通融。共未製成者，槪須依照規定尺寸裝造，倘確有困難之處，可隨時着承製商向公用局洽商。（四）關於保證不發新車牌照一點，本市公用局自七月五日起，已早有通告停止三輪車新車登記在案，自毋庸議。（五）取締無照一點，查無照行車，事屬警局經常工作，已由該局隨時取締。</p>
<h3>修復破損道路　增加交通路綫　積極積劃　繁榮南市</h3>
<p>關於繁榮南市恢復戰前市容，公用局及工務局已會商擬訂詳細辦法。據悉：南市破損道路，除由工務局積極修復外，并用公用局增加南市交通路綫，交通工具及路燈。目前中華路及民國路環城之公共汽車車輛稀少，乘客擁擠不堪，該局現在計劃增加車輛，待物資供應局之車輛抵埠後，即可實行。其次江邊磚顧濟渡口至南洋橋一段，中經斜橋唐家　復興東路等熱鬧地帶，決予增關公共汽車。最近南市外馬路，正由工務局修理道路中，一經修復，公用局亦擬增購公共汽車行駛路綫。現擬自東昌路輸渡碼頭起，向南經南碼頭過國貨路，折北經車站路轉入中華路至南洋橋爲止。此外擬於南市各街道普遍裝置路燈，務期恢復至戰前狀况。</p>
<h3>公務員無力製寒衣　服裝店大都不景氣</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕入冬未久，已有兩次寒流襲滬。據天文台預測，未來的幾天中，還有第三次寒流過境，而且這次寒流的期間比較過往兩次都要來得長。這消息在沒有冬衣的人們看來，眞感到有一種說不出的威脅，正發愁如何來打發這一連串的冷峭的日子。一般小公務員整日悶鎖在辦公室裏，除了籌劃一天能吃一碗飲飯外，還得爲一家活口安排幾件可以抵禦寒流的冬衣。打開報上公佈的生活指數一看，衣著依然是商踞首位，做一件最普通的呢大衣也要二十幾萬元。有的人以爲可以在舊服店裏買件舊衣服或到聯合商塲內買件美國現成貨來加以　改。可是手工太貴，修改一件舊衣的工價，比原衣的價錢還要來得多，於是人們便宜咀咒服裝店的老　了。</p>
<p>但服裝店的老　却大呌冤枉，打開一個門而，能够維持已經很不容易，尤其在這不景氣的年頭，賺得的幾個錢，包括了無限的辛酸和眼淚。今年生意蕭條比戰前的情形不差得多。國貨原料成本高貨色差，外國貨來路少，栽縫司務的工價隨時增加。老　在應得之外，還得負担店員的伙食薪金及一切營業上必需的開支，所以有很多的服裝店已經辭退一半的司務，覺得吃了飯，沒有生意做。還有的是爲了遷就主顧，只好抑低工資，接得生意後，由學徒來代蓄大司務的職務，結果把顧主的定衣做壞了，只得重做或者退定洋。</p>
<p>最使老　頭痛而不得不勉强敷衍的是境內若干與營業有關的「頂頭上司」，他們常常是沒有理由的要求减價，至少打個八五折，老　心裏實在不願意，嘴裏還得說「請帮忙」這眞是啞吧吃黃蓮，說不出的苦。</p>
<h3>扶植勞工組織　促進勞資協調　谷部長談勞工政策</h3>
<p>社會部谷部長正綱，昨日抵滬，參加全國海員代表大會，並於昨晚六時歡宴全體海員代表，邀楊特派員謝書記長等作陪，宴後接見記者稱：今後吾人當前之任務，亟應扶植勞工組織，改善勞工生活，提高勞工地位，促進勞資協調，與提高勞工效能。今日之中國勞工，應向鞏固國家統一，維護生產上努力云云。記者又詢以對本市各工廠職工要求年賞有何意見，谷氏謂：關於年終賞金問題，昔年雖有此例，但現時各廠商困難，亦屬事實，本人曾與吳市長研究，由市府訂一辦法，分別決定。總之，必須要勞資雙方互相諒解，互相體卹。</p>
<h3>皮革工業壓力重重　大部陷半停頓狀態　廿六家倒閉千餘工人失業</h3>
<p>據皮革品製造業界人士談：全滬中小規模之皮革品製造廠共三百五十餘家，上月份受高利貸壓迫而不　支持致倒閉者達二十六家，年關帶緊，預料屆時將有一小半皮革品工廠不能安然渡過。考其原因爲：（一）玻璃皮品傾銷，充斥市塲，以其價廉物美，國貨皮革品無法與之競爭。（二）高利貸利息已大至三角，增加生產成本，且產品不銷，週轉呆滯。（三）工資增高，工人膳食隨物價高漲。（四）外埠運輪困難，戰前原有之運銷地無法暢通，本埠購買力薄弱。據悉：目前各皮革品製造廠大部陷入半停頓狀態中，僅以十數工人以製大件皮箱維持殘局，至小件皮革品，以生產率高，供過於求，故工人因此已有千餘人停歇，際此冬令時節，彼等均有不能溫飽之虞。</p>

<h3>上海的皮貨業</h3>
<p>皮貨的產區在北方，平津一帶，爲皮貨業的集中地。上海經營皮貨業者亦不少，普通稱皮貨局。現在，如「天發祥」「大集成」等均稱爲大伺行，大都集中於河南路一帶，大大小小的皮貨店，現在祇剩十一家，和戰前相比，已减少三分之二。其他尙有谷地販賣的皮貨行。大的時裝店像「鴻翔」等也出售皮貨，但都是已經做好的大衣了。至於許多洋商所經營的皮貨商店，則均在南京路靜安寺路及霞飛路一帶，營業對象以外僑爲主。</p>
<p>皮貨依來源，分有西口北口兩帮，西口貨來自陝甘一帶，北口貨來自東北及熱察冀北各地，張家口爲其集散地。滬地皮貨，全部由皮貨商人販賣而來。此種流動的皮貨商人稱爲皮客人，是介乎皮貨行和產地廠塲之間的。每年秋風初起，他們在產地收購了皮貨，結隊啓程南下，抵達江南，正當秋氣未深，皮貨生意初上市的時候。皮客人到滬後，即投奔他的老主顧，皮貨行中去躭擱，各皮貨行大都設宴相待。皮客人俟所帶貨物由丹車運到後，即訂定日期，召集全體皮貨行的負資人，將所備貨樣，當衆傳觀，以定價目之高下，等貨物賣完後，在春風吹動的當兒，便整裝北返。歸去時，他們得向各皮貨行預支貨款，往往成千累萬，他們就拿這錢向產區辦貨，所以他們阪運，全憑信用兩字。</p>
<p>皮貨是一種季節性的商業，每年營業時間，祇有冬令三個月，一年營業的得失全看這三個月如何，要添置新裘的人，大都在舊曆年前備好，一過新年，任你怎樣春寒料峭，總是乏人問津。亦有在夏季兼營夏布扇子等買賣的。自從抗戰以後，皮貨來源受阻，勝利以來，又因張垣發生戰事，仍不能源源而至。加以市面不景氣，每襲數十萬以至幾百萬的新裘，能有多人少買得起呢。</p>
<p>目前皮貨，以製成女大衣者爲多，先生們的長袍，不及十之一二。最暢銷的，爲獾皮，貓皮，白楣，羊皮等幾種，男人袍統則以白羊皮，灰鼠，狐皮較多，價格自二三十萬元至百餘萬元不等。較名貴之黃狼皮，玄狐，灰背，豹皮等，均在一二百萬元以上，銷數是有限得很。至於稀有的紫貂，大家都當作古董，買進賣出，市價有員至千萬元者。</p>
<h3>皮貨叢談</h3>
<p>— 本報特稿</p>
<p>西伯利亞的寒流，已侵襲到上海。在寒冷的西北風裏，冬裘成爲應時的服飾，女子們披上了狐皮或灰背大衣，充分地顯示出她們的高貴的身份。可是她們那會知道獵戶們在冰天雪</p>
<p>地中巡狩的苦況？須知千金之裘，並非一狐之腋所能製成的呀！</p>
<p>漁獵時代的人，早知道獸皮是禦寒妙品。而社會進化，皮衣亦成爲貴族的專利品，在過去帝制時代，皮裘是不能隨便穿着的，所謂「一品玄狐二品貂，三品四品穿烏刀」。某一階級的人只准穿某一種皮，越級不僅爲社會所訕笑，亦爲政令所不許。不過歐風東漸以後，男子改穿西裝者日多，即不穿西服，亦多穿絲棉袍子。婦女們嫌皮衣太臃腫，會遮掩了她們苗條約身材，更不喜穿着。素被人視爲華貴服飾之皮衣，已爲大家所摒棄。直至近幾年來，婦女們流行穿皮大衣，皮衣得到美人的靑睞，始稍稍恢復其昔日的身價。</p>
<p>因歷代認皮衣爲衣服中的珍品（圖爲盛行英美之波斯羊皮大衣）　，經營皮貨的人也莫不利市三倍。在大家不穿皮衣的幾年中，皮貨業一落千丈，過去珍貴的皮貨，要作爲傳家之寶，現在已被人認爲笑話。所幸女式皮大衣盛行，雖可失之東隅，收之桑楡，但終不及昔日全盛之時。補救危局，應着眼在出口方面。</p>
<h3>羊皮出口大宗　每年銷海外　數近千萬張</h3>
<p>我國爲世界養羊國家之一，羊皮爲輸出大宗，每年運銷海外者近千萬張，平衡國際收支，不無小補。東北蒙古等地，一片平原，乃天然之大牧塲，牛羊極多。南方四川一省，產量特豐。此項羊皮，以張垣漢口爲集中地，而由津滬出口。</p>
<p>羊皮之的製作程序，分（一）殺（二）剝（三）整（四）晒四步驟。殺羊普通以鐵錘擊其頭，使失知覺，然後割斷喉管，放淸血液。亦有縛羊於木板之上面殺之者，稱爲縛殺，易汚皮毛，故成劣板。川陝有殺跑羊一法，殺者騎羊背，用手抉羊頭使起，刀刺其喉，然後放去，羊乃奔躍，血流滿地，以至氣絕身死，爲狀至慘。</p>
<p>羊旣殺死，即須剖剝。剝皮技術，頗有高下，影響皮質甚大。純用刀剝，往往易傷皮板。內江成都等地剝皮之法最妙，一面用拳按揉，一面用手扯皮，扯皮時盡量少用氣力。剝皮切忌身首分離，頸部亦不能狹過五公分，因美國歡迎全張羊皮也。</p>
<p>剝下之羊皮，在晒前，尙須修整。凡留存於皮板上之脂肪·肉層·泥灰等均須除凈，膝部之皮，完全除去，頭部凸出處面積極小，亦須修除。修正時，切勿傷及皮板，或皮上留有刀痕，亦不可用水洗，凡經水洗者，油潤光澤盡失，毛衣結澀，成爲「水漿板」矣。</p>
<p>羊皮晒乾，半由風吹，半藉日光曝晒，毛衣方臻完美。一般收買羊皮之行號，皆有「晒壩」，天雨則置於「風乾塲」上，亦有因急於交貨，以火烤皮者，稱爲「火坑板」。普通在產地殺剝之羊皮，經晒乾後，運至集散地，再加修整複晒，使皮質能符合出口標準也。</p>
<p>浙江嘉興·吳興·長興·平湖一帶，產小羊皮一種，每年出口量亦不小。其地農家，大率養羊兩三只，母羊懷孕足月者售之，或俟母羊分娩後，出售羔羊，亦農家副業之一。小羊皮分出胎與肚剝二類，前者即剝初生之羔羊，後者將懷孕之母羊擊斃，取出胎羊，而剝其皮，至爲慘酷。宰殺胎羊，本於禁例，但商人利之所在，無復顧忌，禁者自禁，而殺者自殺也。</p>
<p>輸出羊皮，均爲生坯，銷路以美國爲大宗，英國·法國·坎拿大·澳洲·印度各地，亦有銷路。價格視底板之厚薄毛鋒之長短，色澤之鮮暗爲轉移。現在上海經營羊皮出口之行號，的有十餘家。今年一月至九月，九個月問輸出羊皮一·一〇六·二七九張，共値法幣二·九五六·七一〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>皮衣三部曲　狩獵·養殖·製作</h3>
<p>狩獵是獲取皮毛的第一步。西北東北谷地的農民，都以狩獵爲副業。每年秋高馬肥，正是行獵之時。獵戶們携帶獵犬，結隊入山，先焚枯草，使野獸無所掩蔽，然後圍擊。經騐豐富的獵手，他們有充分的獸類知識。知道某一種野獸潛伏在那一地區，某一種野獸在什麽時候出來，更能觀察泥土上所留着的蹄痕，便知道野獸們的來踪去跡。他們是剛毅勇敢，而又十分細心，在深山叢林間，度過那寒冷的冬天。　獵手大都以土銃射擊動物，然亦有因動物之習性，而改用其他方法者，如捕灰鼠則張網，一網可得數百只。按行獵本有時間和區域之規定，同時又不可貪得無厭，我國獵戶並不注意及此，以致動物愈捕愈少，其未長成者，皮小而毛短，品質因之降低，幾種稀少的野獸，獵取一濫，甚至有滅種之虞，土銃射擊，更易損壞皮質，故有所謂「劣板」，此皆應注意者也。</p>
<p>野生動物，捕捉不易，且生殖一任自然，不能恣意獵取，於是設立人工養殖之歡囿，然野獸飼於籠中，不僅不能繁殖，即毛色光澤，亦不若天然生長者之佳。故必須　廣大之牧塲，仿原野山林之佈置，飼養其中，則與在天然環境中無異。近來又經科學改良，亦有幾種動物，能在籠中飼養。故人工養殖方法盛行後，許多珍貴動物之皮毛，產量可以大增矣。　皮毛獸之養殖，始於德國之養兎業。兎本家畜，飼養較易。野生動物經人工飼養者，則美國實開其端。阿拉斯加原爲良好之皮毛產地，因皮毛進口日增，乃在該地設塲，試行飼養水貂，不數年而產量大增。貂皮本作黃褐色，改用遺傳原理，人工交配，故又產生新種，其中以純白色及暗藍色兩種，在市塲上更受人歡迎。</p>
<p>西伯利亞之廣大森林，多野獸踪跡，俄國皮貨，早已馳名歐洲，光澤的灰鼠，輕暖的貂皮，皆爲世所珍重。自美國人工飼獸成功後，蘇聯亦接踵而起、西伯利亞各地，凡適於獸類生活之區，均關爲飼獸園，或捕捉雛獸，飼養以助生長，或用人工方法，加以繁殖。尤以近北冰洋之海濱，設塲飼養海狗，足與阿拉斯加之水貂相媲美。試觀他國方日趨改進，而我國獵戶，往知捕捉，不知保護財源，一且野獸絕跡，更從何取其皮毛，實殺鷄取卵之下策也。</p>
<p>獵戶們獲得了野獸，剝取其皮，載至市塲出售，在張家口包頭一帶一隊一隊的駱駝，一輛一輛的大車，滿載着臭味難聞的獸皮，這都是獵戶們辛勤所獲得的。那裏有許多皮作坊，製作皮貨，以供應來自內地的皮貨商人，皮作坊規模極小，全用手工製作。他們將原皮買來之後，先刮除皮內附着的腐肉，再經過了鹽硝，整理一番，即算完成。皮作坊裏，原皮和鹽硝的氣味混合着，刺激得十分難受。據說：皮作坊裏的工人，很少能活到五十歲以上的，就是因爲那惡臭之氣，摧毀了他們的生命。　一件皮衣，不是一張獸皮所能製成的，這剪配工作，實在不是一件容易的事。毛之鬆密，鋒之長短，以及顏色光澤，均須十分相似，然後可以配合成裘。同時尺寸大小，隻數多寡，都會影響到價格。一襲皮衣的完成，眞不知要費幾許心血，這是穿皮衣的人們所不會想到的。</p>
<p>土法製皮，很容易損及皮毛的色澤。過去我國所出口的皮件，有一部份在海外加以精製，重新輸到中國來，一轉手問，漏扈不知幾許。今美國人工養殖事業發達後，原皮出口减少，精製皮毛進口日增，更使該業一落千丈，不知將來如何能挽救這頽勢？</p>
<h3>皮裘種種</h3>
<p>我國不愧爲地大物博的國家，就是皮裘種類，熱帶之虎豹，寒帶之貂狐，都有產品。當你選購皮貨的時候，夥計們會如數家珍地吿訴你。</p>
<p>貂皮爲皮貨中之珍品，過去不僅貂裘不能輕易穿着，即一頂貂冠，也是欽賜中極貴重的東西。據說服貂裘而立風雪中，較在屋內爲暖，這是他所以名貴之處。貂乃一種很小的食肉動物，長的二尺五寸，短耳尖吻，形狀像鼠，毛黃黑中帶紫，亦有純白者曰銀貂，黑者曰紫貂。產於遼東敦化延吉一帶，及牡丹嶺三姓各地，而以哈爾巴嶺所產者爲佳。白晝棲伏森林中，至夜始出，覓烏鼠等充飢。獵者佇立林間，屛息悄聲而射之。一貂之皮，方不盈尺，積六十餘貂僅成一裘，其難得如此，目下貂裘一襲，總須六七百萬元。</p>
<p>狐皮</p>
<p>狐皮亦爲上品，其禦寒溫體之功，略遜於貂，而輕柔則與貂相彷彿。狐產於北方，爲較普通之動物，身長三四尺形如犬而略瘦，毛作黃赤色。性狡猾多疑，穴居林中，晝伏夜出。東北之吉林三姓各地及蒙古之庫倫一帶均有之，品種多，貴賤亦相懸殊。市上所風行者，以玄狐爲最珍貴，作純黑色，營黃狐，白狐亦爲上品，前者毛鋒頗厚，色黃而亮，後者毛色潔白，細軟而有光澤。其他如紅狐，烏刀狐，以及長城以南之隔山狐，陝甘之西路狐，亦頗流行。草狐品質最低，產於浙江溫台一帶。狐裘之價，貴者每襲二三百萬元，草狐亦須四五十萬元。狐腋之毛白色，集以爲裘，最輕暖，故亦爲名品，史稱孟嘗君有狐白裘一襲，價値千金，珍貴可以想見。</p>
<p>鼠皮</p>
<p>亦裘中上品，不减狐皮。鼠本普通動物，但皮可製裘之鼠，則非通常所習見。說文所謂：「　鼠出丁零胡，皮可作裘。」即俗稱灰鼠者是，產於黑龍江吉林一帶田野中，興安嶺嫩江附近所產者更佳。毛豐厚，呈靑黑色，腹部色白。以之製裘，成黑地白斑圖案。今婦女製大衣，嫌白色斑紋不稱，僅取背部，稱曰灰背，較用全張製成者更貴，目下灰背大衣每襲須三百萬元左右。</p>
<p>另有一種銀鼠，毛色潔白，其皮亦可製裘。銀鼠產於外蒙古及西伯利亞一帶，形較灰鼠稍大，毛羢甚密，白而光澤。銀鼠銷路，不若灰鼠之受人歡迎，過去僅以銀鼠作衣服上之裝飾品——名曰「出風」。西洋婦女，却喜銀鼠，結婚時更喜用銀鼠製爲禮服，取其純潔之意。市上大都以兔皮作銀鼠，但毛羢色澤終不如。</p>
<p>目前市上流行一種白楣，亦鼠皮之類產於江，浙，皖，贛一帶　，色灰毛湧，白色羢底，長一尺有餘。過去專銷英美，作女大衣之用。年來國內士女亦多服用，大衣一襲，自數十萬至百餘萬。</p>
<p>羊皮</p>
<p>羊皮在皮貨中，應列次品，其實羊皮之毛色品質，大有分別，貴賤亦極懸殊。羊　皮以綿羊爲主，羔羊一皮輕毛嫩，故允勝。浙湖一帶，宰殺胎羊以取其皮，爲農家副業。陝甘一帶所產者，黑毛，稱黑紫羔，其價更貴。豫魯燕晋諸省，好宰殺初生小羊，稱爲猾皮，專做褥墊，價亦不賤。</p>
<p>宰羊多在冬季，取其毛長而絨實。品質最佳者稱爲難皮，毛鬈　曲長三寸許，翻覆轉側皆順勢，有光澤，細軟而輕。以甘陝靑寗一帶所產者爲佳，難皮袍子，的値二三十萬元。尙有一種稱爲充灘者，毛粗而無底絨，故次於灘皮。</p>
<p>靑種羊產於甘肅境內，毛面甚白，根梢帶靑，細長而柔。珍珠皮則羊皮中之毛短而鬈曲者，絨甚厚，以似珍珠而得名，亦產陝甘一帶。二者均爲羊皮中之　品。</p>
<p>黃狼皮</p>
<p>黃狼皮產於長江下游各地，人冬以後，農民捕而宰之，毛呈黃色，贛省所產者最深，山東產者最淡，雄者毛豐而皮版薄，雌者皮版厚而毛鋒細。過去輸至外洋，每年爲數不小。戰時國外銷路斷絕，津滬製皮作實行自硝自染，製爲皮大衣，頗爲女界所樂用。</p>
<p>猞猁皮</p>
<p>猞猁皮亦極珍貴，大衣一襲，在二百萬元之譜。猞猁爲水中動物，形如貍貓，週身長毛，背部　淺灰，胸腹作白色，間以黑色之圓點，成葡萄形。產於　藏東北各地，蒙古產者最爲上品，東北所產者色微黃，故品質略次，西藏產者毛細而無力，更在其次，製成之裘，有肩。肷。腿之別，亦有以數整只猞猁，混合製成者，鑲前後兩袖成六條形，名曰「六條脊」肷乃以胸腹部之皮製成，最名貴。</p>
<p>獺形如鼬鼠，長三尺餘，頭扁眼大，肢短有蹼，穴居水中，捕魚而食。全體被細長毛，夏日呈黑色，冬則稍赤。其皮亦可爲裘，有江獺，關獺，藏獺之別。江獺產於湘蜀雲貴各地，以湖南寳慶之江獺爲最佳，關獺產於東北，毛結實而鋒甚短，藏獺指西藏產品，毛極濃厚，長六七分，爲獺皮中之上品。</p>
<p>犴</p>
<p>犴爲一種野犬，長毛厚絨，呈褐黑色，爲禦寒妙品。東北各地，年產甚多，浙之於潛，昌化，蘇之溧陽，金壇，均有之。在英美諸國，亦有銷路。</p>
<p>虎豹與兔皮</p>
<p>虎豹之皮，乃顯貴家中床楊沙發問之陳飾品，亦有用以製衣者。虎豹均產於多山之區，東北之江大嶺牡丹嶺，西南之滇黔川康諸省，均爲產地。然以捕提不易，故產量甚少，市上恒以山貓皮充之，毛色較淡，但黑斑頗相似。</p>
<p>兎皮有家兎野兎之別。野兎以東北各　所產者爲上，毛色略　　，長三寸許，極柔軟，嫩江所產者更好。江浙皖一帶湖沼蘆薈問，亦有野兎，毛作蘆花色，僅銷海外，供製帽之用，罕有作裘者。家兔則取毛色純白者，乃四川之特產，其他各省，產量極少，亦以外銷爲主，每年輸出約二百萬張。</p>

<h3>年關迫近　廠商危機深刻　亟望政府救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來因高利貸壓迫及外貨傾銷，一般工商業俱受嚴重影響，開支旣增高，營業尤蕭條，倒閉淸理之聲，時有傳聞。當此節近年關，危機更深。記者特走訪本市工商界某著名領袖，據談本市工商業之困難，已爲週知之事實。自七月間市商會代表晋京請願，已將所遭受之痛苦，暴露社會，公開呼籲。其後市參議會亦有請願團赴京，上月初全國商聯會在京開會，更有具體之要求，據本人所知，上海工廠方面，除少數之棉紗織廠外，一般廠家，俱難維持，目前之阢隉不安，方聞其端耳，在新舊年關，政府如不再予以切實援助，恐有大半必將擱淺。査本市工廠工人，的有三十萬人，除國營民營紗贓工人，的佔三分之一外，其他工廠，如有倒閉，則立即有大批工人遭受失業，對於社會安寗，影饗殊大。回憶數月前僅數千復員工友，因無工作，大鬧市府，此番攤販失業，又成巨波，年終如有大批工人失菜，則羣情激動，上海秩序更將不堪設想矣。加以閉廠後之債務整理問題，亦爲關係甚大之社會事件。蓋目前一般廠家多賴高利貸款維持，此項資金，非來自銀行，而係向社會各階層拆來，如普遍發生呆滯，則一倒百倒，牽涉甚廣。故爲社會安寗計，深感工商業倒不得，甚望政府能及早預籌對策，從速拆放低利貸款，使獲轉機，以免破產，則社會安寗，庶幾得以保全。</p>
<h3>金價上漲的原因　某觀察家分析爲十點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金價節節上漲，連日疊見新高價。據某觀察家分析原因，不外下列十端。（一）最近各地金價趨勢堅挺，以香港金價言，如以目前港匯折算，合三百四五十萬元。他如天津金價，亦達三百廿萬元。（二）外埠客商運貨來滬銷售後，大多喜以所得價款，收購黃金返里。（三）時局不靖，傳共軍之「解放區」，一切賦捐，均需以黃金繳付。（四）外匯再度調整之說，仍醖釀不散。（五）過去大批美鈔之持有者，今以修正進口貿易辦法頒行，美鈔或將失去效用，故咸出鈔進金。（六）款收息，近因受工商不景氣影響，趨勢漸吿不穩。而黃金節節上漲之程度，亦不下於所得利息，故咸將放款收回，搜購黃金，以資保障。（七）通貨趨勢，仍屬膨脹。（八）中央銀行拋售黃金數額不多，故未能控制金市。（九）股市長期盤檔，奄奄無生氣中，股市資金，遂亦轉向黃金。（十）小錢莊近亦羣起經營黃金對敲交易，一敲五十條一百條者，已不足爲奇。且更做開黃金期貨交易，一般投機者，更趨之若鶩。</p>

<h3>美國購買絲綢　首批爲五萬疋　但買價僅合我市價七成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近傳美國方面經由中美實業公司之介紹，將向我國購買絲綢二十萬疋。記者頃以此訊詢之中美公司當局及有關方面，悉此項接洽尚在繼續中，美國首批購買數量爲五萬疋，而其願出之買價，僅爲我國市價之七成，現綢廠方面，正向中央信托局請求將該局收購之生絲，以每磅六元五角美金之成本價格，售與各織　廠，藉使綢之成本减低，能適合美方之需要。同時指出生絲在美，因日絲競爭關係，銷路至爲不暢，不如加工製造爲有利；且以品質最佳之生絲輸出國外，而以劣質之絲供本國織綢之用，使國產綢失去海外市塲，亦非上策。現悉中信局經一再請求後，已同意廉價供給生絲，每疋綢需用絲的十六磅，預計供給量甚爲巨大。本市絲綢業正靜待在美談判之結果，一俟合同訂立，將集會商討各廠承製量之分配。據有關人士表示：有一都份設備較小之廠家，因技術關係，恐不能承製；同時希望央行及中一信局方面，能以最迅速之步驟供給原料，使各廠能在被高利貸逼倒之前，即能開工承造，渡過危機。</p>

<h3>商品檢驗工作近來漸次減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕商品檢騐局自勝利復員以來，即在蔡局長無忌領導之下，積極從事於商品之檢騐，意在審査商品之品質，增高我國商品在國際市塲上之信用，勝利之初，因國內積存商品之待運外洋者甚夥，且因成本價格關係送局請騐者極爲踴躍，該局復員伊始，工作甚感繁重，近數月以來，因國內積存之商品多已運銷外洋，而國內產品亦以成本及外匯等關係，大都不願出口，除由國家經營之商品外，商人之送局請檢者已極微少，該局檢騐商品，共分五處：（一）農作物品檢騐處，包括豆類及茶葉，（二）畜產品檢騐處，包括猪鬃，腸衣，火腿，毛革等，（三）化工品檢驗處，包括肥料及植物油，（四）植物病蟲害檢驗處，包括蔬菜水菓，（五）蠶絲檢驗處，包括蠶種及生絲，此外並設總務處，統理內部組織，檢騐步驟，依商品之類別品質而異，大的豆類撿騐着重摻雜物，茶葉以色香味爲斷，畜產品則視其品質之良窳新陳，化工品審査其成份含量，植物病蟲害，以是否消毒蛀蝕而斷其可吾，蠶種蠶絲着重品質重量，或則呈揆樣品，或則拆卸檢騐，總期出口以後，不致影饗我國商品之信用，其整個程序爲：申請檢騐，塡寫請騐書，經調査審査後，其合格者，發給許可證，憑許可證始得報關云。</p>

<h3>玻璃絲襪暢銷聲中　針織業岌岌可危</h3>

<p>商品解說</p>
<h3>酸與碱</h3>
<p>— 章柏菴</p>
<p>最近原料市塲，酸與碱，都一齊激起了猛烈的漲風，這其間，大半是屬於投機，小半是屬於實銷。</p>
<p>一個國家工業之發達與吾，亦可以說是國家之强弱，只要看其酸碱用途之比例，就能辨別得出來，如果酸的消耗量比碱大，那末道個國家一定是强國；反之碱之消耗量比酸爲大，那一定是弱國。可是在中國酸碱是英雄無用武之地，所以也就談不到工業，但是聰明的中國人，却拿酸碱來作投機物看待，那也是一種別出心裁的作風。</p>
<p>酸碱爲工業上最重要的居間化合物，所以凡是工業就離不了酸碱。</p>
<p>我國自產之酸廠，在本市規模最大者，爲開誠，戰後則未聞生產，永利雖亦產出硫酸，但僅能供給其本身產製之硫酸錏，故當前製酸工業，可謂默默無聞；至於自產之碱，亦只有永利製造之純碱，戰前永利亦造燒緘，因爲度分稍差，且色澤發紅，終敵不過月牌，現在則尙無燒碱出產。</p>
<p>談起卜內門的月牌碱，在戰前可說是獨覇全中國，牠的存量是非常豐富，在滬地一角來講，自從太平洋戰興後，一直到勝利爲止，還存有三五萬桶，足足有了三年的消耗量，這眞使你感到英商的傾銷力量之偉大。勝利前後，燒碱價格，爲儲幣三四千萬一桶，二百作一以後，每桶價格亦不過十三四萬元，及至上年斯時，則大起波動，每桶起伏甚大，高出卅餘者亦有，最高時簡直不講法幣價値，而代以烚赤十二兩一桶。後以美商開始訂貨，訂貨價格，每噸爲十二萬元，每桶三百公斤，僅合四萬元，到了本年一月間，貨已到埠，但因美貨廠商均未用過，品質如何，又無從知悉，且初次訂貨，冒險者甚少，經第一批到貨之後，用戶用了以後，咸認滿意，於是本市行商紛紛大量定貨，到了本年三四月間，各項定貨，均由馬尼刺轉道來滬，總數的有五六萬噸之多，因之價格由每桶一百萬跌至每桶十八萬元，但美貨價格總較月牌低廉五六萬一桶。</p>
<p>美貸燒碱旣已壓塌了市塲，而實銷又屬微細，有時候雖然亦有小波動，但不旋踵仍復回至原位，中秋前後，每桶價値的爲四十二三萬元。</p>
<p>自七月間美菲禁止燒碱出口後，本市以存底充沛，價格一直沒有飛升，實銷亦並不甚多，客帮亦甚少來辦，雖美菲禁止出口，但香港轉口來貨，仍源源不絕，數雖不多，惟隨到隨銷，存底沒有枯竭，中秋節以後，港貨來源因受美國海員罷工影響亦呈稀落，客帮間亦有動辦，價格徐步上升，以迄十月底，每桶已達八十萬元，後以北帮來滬搜購，本市印染。紗廠亦適於此時吸進大批美貨燒碱，總數的二三千桶，按之本市存底，亦並無多大空虛，但因價格上漲得快，於是引起投機者之埀涎，掀風作浪，大佈空形賣買，市價由八十萬激漲至一百三十萬元，旋因實銷停滯，價又一度回跌至每桶一百十萬至一百十五萬元，但投機者，野心未泯，同時所吸多頭，若一湧出勢必壓塌，一再哄抬，日漲達四五十萬元，最高曾達二百四十萬元一桶，惟一般用戶，以本月份外輸到埠，共在二百餘艘，而裝運燒碱來滬者，也並不在少，故除必需者，購買少量外，預計漲風必可壓倒。</p>
<p>繼燒碱爾後，第二種是三酸——硫酸，鹽酸，硝酸——亦起了猛烈之上漲，尤其是硫酸，、漲勢格外起勁，因爲有了硫酸，還有兩酸，就可改裝，硫酸市貨奇缺，所以亦無大量交易，這裏不多縷述。還有一種呌做石炭酸，隔了一夜，竟然價格漲起十倍，石炭酸是煤焦油分溜至1750c時產出者，爲醫藥，染料之重要化合物。</p>
<p>進口統計　（一月至十月）</p>
<p>名稱　數量（公担）　總值（千元）</p>

<p>笛聲饗處，雙方戰將，聚神會神，開始作戰。約翰猛將，諸德輝首先扣門，爲秦鼎新滿懷抱住，交大同學驚喜交集，三分鐘時交大得一角球，望洪書發來高球，落於禁區，鄧鏡彤憑空躍起，頭上開花，首建奇功。交大啦啦隊吶喊之聲，與雙響炮，齊澈雲霄。雙方繼續混戰，二十七分時，交大陳紹元由門左傳高球至門右，望洪書追上續扣，又建一功，前半時，交大遂以二比〇佔先。</p>
<p>再接再厲連中三元</p>
<p>休息再戰，聖約翰重振士氣，攻勢頻頻，惜無戰略，且射球脚力太軟，每爲秦鼎新從容接住。五分鐘時，交大陳紹元帶球由左方直進，險些出境，觀衆正爲之可惜，豈知劉竟將球鈎回，擦門前而過，望洪書飛起一脚，破門而入。</p>
<p>十二碼球得免全敗</p>
<p>交大以三比〇領先，爆竹一之聲大作，交大旣佔絕對優勢，遂多取守勢，雙方成拉鋸形勢。酣戰卅餘分鐘，至最後二分鐘時，交大沈崇動禁禁區內犯手球，的翰遂得一十二碼球之佳機，諸德輝一射鵠中，拔回一球，再至中場開球時，僅數秒鐘，即吿終結，約翰得幸未吃鴨蛋。</p>
<p>昨啦啦隊秩序極好</p>
<p>昨賽以雙方之形勢來說，均爲聯絡較差，以個人技術來說，交大健將多於約翰，以聲勢來說，交大遠非約翰所能比擬。的翰昨所得之扣門機會，不減於交大，唯脚頭太差，徒勞無功，當爲缺少練習之故。致於聯絡較差，此則爲目前各大學足球隊通病，相信當可逐漸改善。交大後衛，身高力大，球門泰鼎新，經騐豐當，加以何增·劉隆馨之巧妙帶球，是其優點，唯左翼太弱，守門每喜衝出取球，殊欠穩健。昨日交大助威啦啦隊，秩序極好，希望交大對復旦時，勿因以往誤會，再起爭端，是則寄予深切之期望。</p>

<h3>法政勝市體專</h3>
<p>昨日另塲專科組，法政學院對市立體專，下午二時半在交大舉行，由陳良琛任裁判，觀衆近千，球場秩序良好，兩隊亦充分表現運動精神，接觸後，雙方相特不下，直至前半終場前一分鐘，市體專凌雲雁遠射破網，乃以一對零佔光。休息再鬥，十五分鐘時，法政經靈桂足傷隊場，十人應戰，陣容調動，乃順風進攻，但毫無建樹，豈知最後五分鐘，法政福至心靈，劉體寅顧國璋連中二球，故終塲時，法政以二對一反敗爲勝。</p>

<h3>甲組足球第二循環東華昨再勝龍傑　六比一小將下半時連失五球</h3>
<p>東華對龍傑之甲組足球聯賽第二循環，昨日下午二時半在逸園舉行，東華繼續保特常勝紀錄，以六比一大勝龍傑，上半時龍傑力守，東華屢攻不入，戰成各一平手，下半時龍傑防綫，一再被突破，東華攻勢大盛，一連獲中五球，結果雛鳳究不敵老將，東華以六比一大勝。</p>
<p>各一和局</p>
<p>逸園觀衆，四千餘人，情况殊盛，蔣吟僧執行裁判，鳴笛開賽，龍傑先攻，見阻於韓龍海，明哲高弔中央，龍海飛步趕上，吳凱敏不及防備，球入網內，一比零東一華紀錄先開，時距開賽僅一分鐘。龍傑反攻，金祿生單騎深入，邦倫衝出，彼此相撞，球爲邦綸撲住，化險爲夷。東華反裝，韓龍海再度衝刺，盛彼得擅離職守，幸趙承芳解圍，廿分鐘時，谷迪榮脚傷離場，王麟入補，未幾龍海亦傷，惟稍休即重登場，距上半時終場前七分鐘，龍波禁區犯手球，高秀淸主罰中的，一此一龍傑扳成和局。</p>
<p>連中五球</p>
<p>休息過後，兩陣再圓，東華進攻，八分鐘時，幼良頭上擺渡，鐵脚離門十四碼處射門命中，二比一東華再度領前、未幾幼良力叩，又建大功，成三比一，時龍傑猶圖振作奈東華無懈可擊，十分鐘時，阿孫頭項，龍海湊上　一脚球進龍傑網窠，四比一後，龍海獲老孫傳遞，劉郎再度，比數成五對一，龍傑氣沮，一籌莫一展，至終場前十分鐘，林紹鈞，被栽判十二碼，阿孫操刀撥出界一外，不爲已甚也，最後六分鐘，一林文上代進功，替出陳明哲，龍海再破三關，成六比一，完畢。</p>

<h3>優游克合羣</h3>

<h3>江西的西北角（一）</h3>
<p>— 南昌三日航訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>江西的西北角，——贛浙國道以北，南澤鐵路機以西的安義，奉新，靖安，永修，武寗，德安，星子，九江，瑞昌，以及雄踞鄱湖之濱的牯嶺地區，在戰時是江西戰區的主要戰場。此一地區的人們，嚐盡了戰禍的慘害，成了個「殘廢」之區。記者這次得了一個良好的機　，遍進各縣鄉鎭，深入民間，看到戰後農村的實景，與人民生活的艱困。</p>
<p>我們跨過破爛浮　的馮川河浮橋，踏北上岸沙地，倒還看到一條新的安義市街，這是職時被敵人由南岸驅假在這塊沙地上，指爲「人民交易」的場所，現在是安義城區唯一的街市，那兒有糧食，雜貨，和竹木，生意，依然保持鄉鎭市場的原形，南昌，九江的時髦，這裏很少看到。</p>
<p>風，淫戲，吹遍了安義，人們的心緒與時先，都被這些惡習所侵奪，有些地方的賭戲，是土劣把持，有的是勾結包庇，若是一且分贓不勻，該死的依然是該死，曹門捉賭案，就是勾結包庇的現形，當時被捉的賭徒，生意客，看戲的男男女女，有的倖運逃開，有的與捉賭的保警隊，結不解之緣，戲台上雪亮的汽燈被提到掛在大路旁邊的大樹上，作了行刧者的亮光，金戒于，關金票，都裝上了他們的腰包，一聲「滾蛋」，脫了法網，身無財物的看戲客和賭徒，一併帶案法辦。</p>
<h3>鴨鷄壠鷄鴨不留</h3>
<p>安義是熊式輝將軍的故鄉，他的原籍、在安義縣屬的實騐鄉鴨鷄塘，熊氏主續時，有人向他建議將鴨鷄瓏劃爲鄉鎭實驗區，省府於民國廿二年正式將原有的萬埠鄉，改名爲實騐區，另設機構，從事鄉村建設的試騐，熊氏原籍的鴨鷄瓏就是在這個時候，披上了一件鄉村當騐的外衣，——村房一律修建爲新型，有農塲，有學校，……雖然比不上河北正定，在江西的農村中，總算是「出主席」的地方。　現在的實騐區怎樣呢。除了在安囊的鄉鎭，可以找到「當騐鄉」的名詞以外，在鴨鷄壠的一堆瓦礫上，運鴨鷄亦找不到一隻，——新的農村，新的事業，完全被敵人摧燬！</p>
<p>安義的縣城，現在仍然披着一件荒蕪殘破的外衣，原有的城區，一片荒涼，除了有一所由敵僞建築的縣衙門以外，找不到幾棟完整的房屋，歸來的人們看到這樣悽慘景象，亦想重整舊業，無奈資金難籌，徒呼奈何！</p>
<h3>靖安一座甜密的柑子園全貌</h3>
<p>靖安是一座甜密的柑子園，走近城廂，就是一片望無止境的紅綠天景，走到任何一家，柑于是招待客人的佳品，每年的生產收入，在幾萬萬元，有助於農村經濟實在不少，可惜柑園的主人，多是不甚注意改種與培植，今後若要扶持這種特產的收入，必須加以改善，有一舒姓，他就是種植一塊柑園起家，今年收入在千萬，人間的樂事，都在柑于園裏。　舒姓是靖安的大族，現在全縣的人口，有六萬，舒姓要佔十分之二强，他們有家詞，家法，和祖訓，人情惇樸，風習良善，假如族中有不肖之徒，家法使他就範，不但舒姓受到祖訓的敎誨，並且在靖安的社會裏，發生着感化作用，所以地方上很少奸惡狡詐的歹徒，亦不常有挺而走險的距類，他們都各自樂業，相安無事，這裏是較西北地區的一塊樂土。外來的人們，多對靖安的「美景」而戀棧，舒姓的始祖，就是來到那兒創業的一個。</p>
<p>迷信神佛，是現階段的農村社會中一種不易破除的現象，靖安的人們，多少被「迷神」而傷命，有一家患痛疾的人家，乞佛求藥，結果是無餞買藥，而病者上吊，他們有病去問神，缺兒少女亦去問神，田園乾學，家小細事，……一切認爲不能滿足，或是無法解決的事情，都求之於种，所以靖安農村中的「奇神怪佛」，遍地皆是，但是，社會設備與縣政建殼的簡陋，又有什麼較好的方法，替鄉下才百姓，解決困難呢？譬如，有病是應該就醫，衛生院連一粒奎寗沒有，一滴紅秉亦難找，他們的企望，不放在「萬能的神」的肩膀上，誰去給他們想辦法？</p>
<p>海寗小學教員，紛紛參加修理塘堤工作，以期獲取救濟麪粉。圖示：彼等從事沉輥情形。　（諸道元攝）</p>
<h3>奉新縣一鏡頭　死屍陳列館</h3>
<p>我們跨上了奉新城郊馮川河上的大石橋，就連想到北洋軍閥張勳在當時的威風與詭謀，這二座石橋，—土人稱之爲上橋，下橋，是張勳修建的，工程相當偉大，因戰時而破壞的橋墩與橋面，現在由於經費的關係，無法恢復舊觀，僅以木樁學板，來維持馮江兩岸的交通。</p>
<p>舉新縣城遭到敵人破壞，房屋損失，達百分之九十五以上，一片荒草與參天大樹，充分看出它的創傷，原有的縣政府，現在僅剩下一截破牆，城區是變成廢墟，新興的市堪，亦是在馮江南岸當地的人們，不但信神，而且講求「風水」，踏進奉新的縣界，在蓑草蔓野的農村中，看到無數的土地廟似的矮屋，當時以爲是戰後復員歸來的人們，用以棲身之所，走近一看旣無門戶，亦無窓葉，四牆鞏封在矮屋裘面的，是死屍，有的用棺材陳放到百數十年，有的並將死者的官銜年歲，塗寫在牆壁上，考據的結果，才曉得是死者的後裔，爲了乞求後代的發達，而待擇穴以葬，在道種迷信「風永」的惡習下，瓦椽　接的矮屋，是死屍的陳列館，使得生者看到可怕，死者不得入土而安，成爲奉新社會中的一個特別鏡頭。</p>
<p>奉新前任縣長王邦範，對於先任的交代，首先將張任負責辦交代手續的經征處長下獄看管，而張任後因與挖取銀窖案有關，經法院判處徒刑十二年，以致辦交代的無人負責，而王邦範現在又被撤職，被熊現任以「冬防保護」而予以監視，在這種交代擱淺的情况下，有的替王邦範「洗寃」，有的代熊現任頌德，在奉新看到一幕滑稽的官場故事。—險惡，狡詐。</p>
<h3>豪紳剝削　苦了永修老百姓</h3>
<p>戰時敵我在修江兩岸的戰門，苦了永修的老百姓，現在的縣政府與一條由東至西，不到五十家內容空虛的市街，充分的看到永修的人們，是在飢餓綫上掙扎，那兒，不但沒有書店，新聞紙，連一張此較好點的毛邊紙，亦買不到，店舖裏的唯一商品，是油一鹽雜貨更看不到一家米店，住戶們每日的食米，須要在「日中面市」的米市上，打衝鋒似的搶購，原因是饑糧！太窮！</p>
<p>地方上的豪紳勢力相當大，王　二派的門號，迄無止境，爲了一官半職的細故，他們很可能引起械門，縣參議畏的選舉就是一個例子，</p>
<p>窮苦無吿的老百姓，他們在邊地荒蕪的死亡國上，不但遭到生活的壓迫，更不斷被豪紳的剝削，幾至頻於絕境，他們終年辛勞所得，要供應地方機關的捐稅，攤派，和豪紳的「請酒」，「睹博」，……花樣百出的「出抖派」，「送濟禮」，秋收的數子，魷在這些剝削的廣掌下，花僩精光，顆粒無存。</p>
<p>涂家埠，是永修精華之鄉，樣跨在修江之上的南潯大鐵橋，現在依然無恙，但是，車站附近的店房，則被戰火的破壞，一無所存！我們在涂家埠的市衛上，隨地可以看到社會上一些惡習—嫖，賭，娼。</p>
<h3>永武道上　旅人寒心</h3>
<p>永修縣治，過分的偏東，縣境西部的山岳地帶，是今日贛北地區的一塊「不靖之土」，永修至武寗的公路上，白槎附近的山谷裏，有一部份失業軍人，和散兵游勇，在那裏掛着副官，排長的官銜，强買强賣，爲非作歹，匪警的來源；就是這些「老總」的化身，他們不但打刧行路的客人，—掏腰句，刧貨担，有時新娘子的嫁裝，被他們「强迫借用」，更有包天的賊胆，打刧掠奪歸來，逍遙坐在白槎的酒館裏豪飲飽餐，安然無恙。</p>
<p>我們到達白槎的前夕，當地的老百姓在外爲了躲警匪面露宿了一夜，就是護送我們的大隊人馬到了白槎，相距一里之遙的山背，亦傳出　人的匪訊，他們的惡勞力，不但在山岳的永武路上，而且伸展到修江下游的吳城，和南濤公路的沿綫，最近幾次在張公渡附近的刧車案，聽說就是這些「老總」幹的新生意，水路方面，他們強迫對用才百姓的船包裝商貨，保鑣式的護運，否則，此路「不通」，尤其是大帮的木客，非得拜門「老總」手下，就呌你哭笑皆非。</p>
<p>他們在此一地區的人數，大的祇有百餘，幸好沒有什麼政治背景，僅是一股爲合之衆的匪徒，經常在水陸交通綫上滋擾者不過五六十人，槍不齊，但是，永修縣屬的地方武力，有槍二百多枝，現有的實力，超出匪徒數倍，因係分住四鄉，未能集中使用，有的地方，倒被匪徒打算，</p>
<p>當地的老百姓說：「假若你家有萬金，保證有人在夜深人靜時來替你請安」，這正是永武道上的治安寫眞。</p>
<h3>英國教友在華的友誼組織　FAU在河南</h3>
<p>解消後另組友誼服務隊　總部將由鄭州遷至上海　二日航訊　本報鄭州特約記者范世勤</p>
<p>英國有一種敎友，根本反對戰爭，自稱爲和平主義者。當一九三九年，希脫勒向英國開戰的時候，這些英國敎友，在其宗敎觀念上應該反對戰爭，在其國家法律上應該參加戰爭，弄得他們抓苜爲難，結果他們組織一個Friends　Ambuiance　Unit，（友誼救護隊）這樣一方面對得起上帝，一方面也對得起國家。</p>
<p>工作目的</p>
<p>遠在西班牙與法國聯合同英國打仗的時候，那時美國還沒有完全脫離英國，英國國王向在美國的教友徵收軍費，那些教友也是因爲反對戰爭同時又不能反對英王的命令，所以出了錢，只說是「獻給英王用的」，但永遠也不問這錢是怎麼用的。有一天英王因爲沒有火藥，要向那些教友出錢，教友出了錢，說是給政府買糧食的，那也就心照不宣了。</p>
<p>FAW在第一次世界大戰中就有，一九三九年是第二次的組織。他們的目的：救濟受戰爭禍害的人。他們的工作，在歐洲，在近東，在非洲，在印度，一直到了中國。</p>
<p>來到中國</p>
<p>他們到中國來，是一九四一年的事。開始的四個年頭，者在西南各省工作。他們的總部起初在連山，後來搬到重慶。從FAU的手裏運進來的醫藥，相當可觀，有一個時期百分之九十，平民所用的醫藥，是得力於他們運進來的。他們的醫療隊與外科巡迴醫療隊，曾經與中國紅十字會合作，在雲南及印緬邊境工作連山，騰衝等地的醫院，曾經受過他們的支持。貴州以南各縣，他們向平民醫過病，還做過其他的敎濟工作。</p>
<p>深入河南</p>
<p>FAU在今年六月就結束了的，但是他們在中國還繼續着工作，這並不是因爲中國仍舊還在戰禍裏的關係。他們在去年戰爭結束的時候，想集中力量，在受戰爭最慘烈的地方，再服務一個時間，於是他們就選擇到河南。他們的總部由重慶搬到了鄭州。鄭州，衛輝安陽一些敎會醫院，他們接收了過來，帮助了他們復員，一直到了他們自己能够支持他們自己爲止。幾個醫療隊，在河南各地服務，主要的是對付黑熱病，因爲這病特別在河南流行。其中有十五個醫院，是由於他們的帮助，增設了各種醫藥設備，開班了一個醫學工程的訓練班，有十五個學生是從各醫院選來受訓的，使他們能够裝置發電機，修理電話，與裝置其他小型的裝備。</p>

<p>在中牟的黃泛區，特別有意義的，實行了一個鄉村善後的計劃，製梳，畜牧，以及消費等合作社被組織了，診所，學校被成立了。行總的救濟牛奶，衣服，由他們散發了，獸醫示範工作在進行中，而且還在建立一個機構耕種中心。對於黃河堵口復堤的工人，他們也給以一種福利的協助。國際救濟委員會的醫藥用品，也由他們在重慶的工作人員源源的運了過來。他們在上海，漢口，開封，都有辦事處。FAU全部八百人，多半是英國人。在中國是一百二十一火：其中英人五十四人，美人二十七人，加拿大人十四人，紐西蘭人十人，其他十六人是中國人。他們除了派在光山，安陽，衛輝，中牟等地工作外，還有十個人專門在研究黑熱病的治療，有十二個人派到國際救濟委員會，中國工業合作協會，及行總等團體協助工作。</p>
<p>經費來源</p>
<p>他們經費的來源，主要是由美國援華會供給，還種過美國友誼委員會，加拿大的中國戰時救濟公債，以及最近英國政府的帮助。其醫藥及救濟物品是由美國紅十字會與美國睦軍方面供給。食糧，衣服，機械設備是美軍剩餘物資項下撥送他們的。</p>
<p>這次克利浦斯夫人特地到了鄭州，就是因爲有FAU在這裏。始到中牟去了一次，也是爲看看他們對黃泛區着後農村的工作。</p>
<p>促進合作</p>
<p>FAW的李維林先生，是主席。他說他們對於中國人民面上對這艱難與疾苦所表示的緊忍剛毅興奮的精神非常感動。問他們一起工作的中國人，與曾接觸過的中國人，都與他們建立了友誼的關係。雖然因爲語言，習慣等不同，但他們相信對道偉大的工作是能合作而且會有成就的。他們認爲他們對於中國人民貢獻是太需要，但也覺得太有限了，但他們希望東西方人民的瞭解，由此可以促進一部份。</p>
<p>說起他們的困難，也是與其他的人所感覺的一樣，就是中國交通情形太不好，以及通貨太不穩定，使他們顧慮到醫院的發展及一般預算的編製的困難。</p>
<p>總部東遷</p>
<p>FAW是個戰時組織，他們已決定在明年三月底結來，可是有一個友誼服務隊（Friends　Service　Unit），出而代之。FAW的總部，　在本月初由鄭州搬到上海去，以後他們將有一個相當長的時期工作，而且範圍也不限於河南了。FAW就變爲FSW了。</p>
<p>FAW在英國被人議爲「良心反戰者」，而他們現在可以反　人爲「良心主和者」了。</p>
<h3>浙江水利工程</h3>
<p>— 毛起</p>
<p>浙省水利，過去向以海塘工程爲主，晨田水利爲轉，抗戰期內爲配合糧食增產計劃，積極興修農田水利工程，八年間，在浙南各縣推行，尙著成效，復員以後，海塘工程之修復與農田水利工程之興修，均關重要，同時計劃進行，現正積極推展中。茲將本年一月份至十月份止工程進行情形，節陳如次，以備我旅居京滬各地同鄉關懷本省經建工作者之參考：</p>
<p>錢江海塘工程</p>
<p>錢塘江南北兩岸海塘，爲浙西各縣及浙東蕭紹兩縣農田廬舍之屏障。戰時失修，傾圯被多，尤以海寗八堡一帶，暨聞家堰臣伏字號最爲危急，茲將最近搶修情形略述如下：</p>
<p>三十三，三十四兩年間由海寗縣政府組織搶修工程處，搶堵八堡附近一帶決口，奈當時環境不良，購料不易，僅先搶修柴塘，捍禦潮浪，非長久之計。</p>
<p>復員後，即派工程師二人，沿塘查勘，擬具兩岸修復工程計劃，預草計急要部份需款的六十億元，决要部份的需六十三億元，呈報中央，請求撥款興辦。</p>
<p>本年度開始之時，奉中央核撥三十三年呈請補發之搶修海塘經費六千二百萬元，到省當將該款分配北岸搶修經費五千六百萬元，於一月五日邀請地方人士會商組織錢塘江北岸海塘緊念搶修委員會暨工程處，從事擇要搶修，另以六百萬元交由蕭山縣政府，設立南岸海塘搶修工程辦事處，從事搶修聞家堰臣伏字號決口。終以經費有限，及天時多雨。工程無法開展。計自二月份施工起至四月中旬止，北岸完成挑塡石塘附土四千七百餘公方，理砌檔土石二，七五六公尺，購運工地木料一萬八千餘支，輸運條柴一千四百担，南岸亦僅完竣塘面整理工程。</p>
<p>四月下旬，奉中央核定急要部份工程經費六十億元，由中央撥補二十億元，浙閩分署撥補物資二十億元，餘二十億由地方自籌，並先撥匯十億元，到省時以秋潮期迫，欲於短期內將所有決口搶修完成，必需將兩岸原設機構合併改組，以收指臂之效，乃於四月廿七日邀請省級黨政民意機關首長會商決定組織浙江省海塘工程緊急搶修委員會，暨浙江省海塘緊急搶修臨時工程處，統籌辦理，並參照水利局劃分杭海鹽平紹蕭三段工程處原案分段組設工程處，分別施工。自五月一日起至八月底止，所擬各段搶修工程，均告完成，共用材料木樁二萬四千八百九十二支，條柴八萬另五百担，蔴袋二千只，塊石九百公方，洋灰二千袋，共做十四萬四千餘工，用去工款四億七千餘萬元，麺粉九百十餘噸。</p>
<p>七月十三日，遵照中央命令成立浙江省塘工委員會，八月一日成立浙江省錢塘江海塘工程局，接續辦理搶修，並修復永久石塘工程，原設之緊急搶修委員會及臨時工程處，均即結束。</p>
<p>辦理防洪工程</p>
<p>本省各主要河流，年久失治，河牀淤澱，堤埂潰坍，兼以山林砍伐過甚，喪失調節雨水之功能，因戰時積極增加生產，墾種雜糧，接濟民食，不及限制，一遇天雨，往往山洪暴發，浸盈成災。本年夏間，金華江與浦陽江沿河各縣，田禾浸沒，影響秋收·即其明徵·本年除通令各縣厲行造林保林限制梯田耕種，以免表土冲涮淤澱河床外，並擬乘冬令農間，辦理防洪工程，所擬舉辦防洪各河流，及其的需經費，列述如下：</p>
<p>（子）曹娥江緊要防洪工程，已經水利局派員查勘，設計竣事，估需工程費二十三一億零四百九十四萬餘元，現仍派測量隊繼續詳細施測。以作治本計劃之設計。</p>
<p>（丑）東西苕溪及南北湖防洪工程·業經查勘·應在東苕建攔水壩三座，南苕中苕各建一座，並在南北湖各建節制閘一座，並加高培厚其四局塘堤，估需經費三十六億元，水利局已籌組測量隊，前往施測。</p>

<h3>再論「我們所主張的地方制度」</h3>
<p>— 孔大充</p>
<p>「我們所主張的地方制度」一文，已於十一月三十日在本報發表了：但以篇幅所限；未盡其要，現在再補充說明一下：我們談到地方政治制度，就不能捨開地方自治，地方自治是西洋來的一種制度，他有他的一貫理論，我們如果不把他的理論爬梳得淸淸楚楚，訂起法規章則來，總是驢頭不對馬嘴。</p>
<p>怎樣才合於地方自治的基本理論？這要從頭說起，我們不妨把西洋一般人民早經共同認識的幾點，報道出來，這些話，在西洋爲老生常談；然以民國以後所訂的若干自治法規作一種水準去佔量，或者在中國說不定還是新穎的介紹。</p>
<p>第一·什麼是地方自治？地方政治制度，並不一定非自治不可，如果外人管治，則有殯民的地方制度，如果是軍管理，則有軍治的地方制度，如果是一黨獨栽，則有黨治的地方制度，在非民主國家，地方制度是縱式的官治，現代潮流，只談民主，民主的地方政治，就是地方自治，「地方」一面是橫的，因爲同時可有若干「地方」，一面又是縱的，因篇一地方」之內，還可以有「地方」，什麼是「自治」？「自治」是自己管理自己的事，自己的事即巾山先生所說的「衆人之事」，因此，我們得到地方自治的定義，「地方自治」是一定區域內的居民，在法律範圍內，自己組織法人團體並自己管理居民全體之事的一種方式。假使地方自治無「在法律範圍內」的條件，便是一個民主的國家，那就是說：有了主權的地方自治。</p>
<p>第二·要宣行地方自治，必先確定單位。凡是實行地方自治的國家，沒有不把地方單位首先以法律來確定的，地方單位又有基本單位與階層單位的分別，如省下有縣，縣下再有市鄉鎭，市鄉鎭爲基本地方單位，因爲市鄉鎭以下並無其他地方單位，相反的，省縣便是定階層地方單位，因爲省下還有縣市，縣下還有市鄉鎭，保甲不是地方單位，他只是市鄉鎭所由組成的細胞。</p>
<p>第三·地方單位的組織，就是地方政府在地方上的政府機關，並不盡是地方自治政府例如：（一）中央政府在地方上的分支機構；（二）中央政府的代理人；—在省爲省政府，在縣爲縣政府，代理人具有中央政府的職權。（三）中央政府的代辦人，代辦是接受中央政府辦理指定事項，例如省政府奉中央的命令在省境內建築飛機場。</p>
<p>所以，所謂地方政府，包括三個機體，其一是地方自治政府，其二是中央政府代理人的機體，其三三是中央政府（暨各上級政府）代辦人的機體，第一重資格爲地方主體，第二第三重資格爲中央的代表，在尙未實行地方自治的國家，各級地方政府只具有中央政府代表的資格，換句話說，他魷是中央政府的分支機構。</p>
<p>第四·地方自治政府做什麼？地方自治政府應該管理居民全體之事，凡是地方上有關居民生活的政治經濟文化等事，都可以由地方自治政府來管，這就是他的業務，或說功用，或說功能，或說職權，以行政術語來說，就是地方自治行政。與地方自治行政相對的，是國家行政，國家行政就是由中央政府及其代理人所管理的有關人民全體的事，兩個方面管理同探的事，自然發生劃分的問題，法治的國家，沒有不把國家行政與地方自治行政，分得淸淸楚楚的。</p>
<p>由此我們也就知道，世所流行的「地方行政」實在包括三項：（一）中央政府代理人的行政（即國家行政在地方上的一部份）（二）中央政府（暨各上級政府）代辦人的行政（也是國家行政在地方上的一部份）（三）地方自治行政（簡稱自治行政）地方自治行政，劃歸地方自治政府以後，如地方自治政府，有各階層單位存在，再以立法程序，作合理的分配，惟有一原則，階層單位分配宜少，基本單位，分配宜多，理由也很簡單，基本單位，與居民有直接切身利害關係，自治團體，旣然旨在管理居民全體之事，惟有由最貼近居民的自治團體管理最爲切實有效</p>
<p>第五，行政命令與自治監督，省縣的身份與市鄉鎭的身份不同。省縣一面爲中央政府代理人及代辦人，一面爲自治團體，是項代理的職權，包括監督下級地方自治一項在內。市鄉鎭一面爲中央政府代理人及代辦人，一面爲自治團體。是項代理的職權，不包括監督下級地方自治一項在內。中央政府可以行政命令指揮省市政府，然命令對象是中央政府的代理人或代辦人。省政府可以行政命令指揮縣市政府，對象也是中央政府的代理人。縣對鄉鎭，理由也是這樣。但自治團體性質的省政府，與縣市政府無隸屬的關係，當然也無權指揮，自治團體性質的縣政府，無權指揮鄉鎭公所的理肉，也是這樣因是，自治團體性質的省市縣政府及鄉鎭公所，不受任何人的指揮，只受中央政府或中央政府代理人的監督。自治團體是直接對居民負責的。</p>
<p>第六，地方政府預算國家稅源與自治稅源劃分以後，國家稅源，由中央政府徽收取用，自治稅源，由地方自治政府徵收取用，省級地力政府的預算，必分兩種：（一）中央政府代理代辦部門，爲國家預算的一部份，與地方居民無涉，（二）自治部門，是收的自治捐稅，用在地方自治行政上面，上級監督機關只有核准之權，至於如何收支，如何動用，如何審核決算，都是自治團體本身的事，上級監督機關，不必干涉。</p>
<p>第七，中央集權與地方分權從上面種種分析，在地方自治觀點上，因而我們可以確定中央集權與地方分權的涵義：（一）中央集權：甲，國家行政事項多，乙，地方自治行政首長及地方自治的立法人員由選舉而產生者少，丙，監督地方自治之權强或及於干涉。丁，國家稅源多。（二）地方分權：甲，地方自治行政事項多。乙，地方自治行政首長及地方自浩的立法人員由選舉而龍生者多。丙，監餐地方自治之權弱，丁，自治稅源多。</p>
<p>第八，中央政府與地方自治政府爭起權來又怎樣？關於這一點，在英美是普通法院的事，在大陸國家以及其他法治的國家，多由行政法院去解決，上級監督機關不能以命令栽決這種糾紛　因爲他就是中央政府，以中央政府自身爲一造的糾紛案件，怎能自已去裁定？</p>
<p>第九，地方自治政府有什麼治權？他們有：（一）執行經，（二）立法權（三）司法權，但司法權只在美國地方自治制度下存在，大陸制度以及世界其他各國制度，都不容納司法權在地方自治範疇以內。</p>
<p>第十，地方自治政府怎樣配合並行使執行權與立法權？概要言之，可分三種：（一）執行機構與立法機構分立制，（二）執行機構與立法機構混合制。（三）經理制。</p>
<p>第十一，地方自治政府的首長是什麼？這當然各國不同，歸納起來說，也不外：（一）是執行機構的首長，（二）是執行機構的首長兼立法機構的苜長。（三）是執行立法混合機構的首長。（四）是與其他執行首長並立的首長—如美國的一種市。（五）（無首長）—如美國的縣。</p>
<p>第十二，地方自治政府的議會是什麼？歸納起來說，也不外：（一）是立法的性質，（二）是立法兼執行的性質，（三）是諮詢的性質，（其決議案無拘東執行機關的效力）</p>
<p>第十三，中央機構與自治機構的關聯省市縣政府暨市鄉鎭公所分開兩個機構以後—首長有雙重身份，他在中央政府代理及代辦機稱上，爲中央的代表，接受中央的指揮，使用中央的經費，絕對對中央負責，此外，幷代表中央監督下級地方自治。（市鄉鎭除外）。</p>
<p>但他在自治機構上，爲地方的公僕，一面遵從自治機構的決議，使用自治經費，一面受上級機關的監督，絕對對選民負責</p>
<p>上可的十三點是地方自治的基本理論，就此基本理論，反觀我們的地方制度；</p>
<p>第一，單位。　（一）省—省是否爲地方單位，事實上在動盪中。（二）市（院屬市及省屬市）—事實上認爲也方單立。（三）行政督察專員區—事實上不認爲地方單位，但也沒有明自規定爲中央政府（及省）的代理人。（四）縣—確認爲地方單位。（五）區—是否爲地方單位，幷不明瞭。（六）鄉鎭—朱完全認爲地方單位。（七）保—好像也認爲是地方單位。</p>
<p>第二，組織　依照現實情形說，在地方上承辦國家行政的機構與辦理地方自治行政的自治團體，幷不劃分，下級政府一味接受上級政府的無限度的監督，事實上監察權與指揮權又分不開來，上級政府命令怎樣做就怎樣去做，幷且，執行的首長是一貫的委任職務，立法機構，雖有各級參議會及保民大會，事實上均是諮詢的性質。　第三，業務。國家行政與地方自治行政，從未劃分，因未劃分，中央政府管什麼事，好像省，市，縣，鄉，鎭也可管着，而事實上，則中央向省市奪權，凡是有利可圖或是易於辦理的事，中央政府每每從省市手裏奪取過來，省對中央，無可奈何，轉而向縣及省屬市奪取縣市所管的事，最後到了鄉鎭，鄉鎭是受層層剝削的單位。於是鄉鎭便無地方向治行政事項可辦，事實上所辦的全是縣政府辦不了的微兵催糧以及募集國債等一類的國家行政的事。省，市，縣，鄉，鎭一直到現在幷沒有嚴格正確的預算，間或有的，也多是上新政府所代編，動用預算，幾乎完全要聽從上級政府的命令。</p>
<p>關於稅源　過去所劃分的二級制。幷未嚴格實行，現在所劃分的三三級制，稅源也編重在中央方面。</p>
<p>就上面所說的三點觀察，我們可以得到現在中國地方政治制度的結論，現在中國地方制度，實在不是自治，幷目是極端中央集權的官治。但政治協商會議憲法草案決議，對於地方制度，重心置之於省幷規定省長民選，這種說法，已趨於極端的地方分權。果如政協決議，若干年後的中國，必然有春秋時代的中央，也必然有變態的美國的各州，此制行之中國，危險實被。不偏於中央集權，也不偏於地方分權，實在是「我們所主張的地方制度。」</p>

<h3>國人與國貨</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>本刊編者曾以「用國貨最光榮」爲號召，促醒國人注意。購用國貨是愛護國家的光榮行爲。要使民族工業站得穩，要使國家不致淪爲外國的消費市塲，要使國民血汗膏脂不爲列强所吸吮吞噬，吾人就必須以購用國貨爲原則，謹機所知，略加申論。</p>
<p>檢閱近半年來的進出口貨的統計數字，吾人眞不寒而慄，外貨如潮般的湧進，出口貨就稀如鳳毛麟角，人超的數字實在大得驚人！以前認爲爭取外國市塲最可靠的本錢如桐油，茶葉，絲等又以成本過高無利可圖，而致躊躇不前，無法換取外匯。如此下去，我們除了舉債塡塞進出口之不平衡外，又有什麼辦法？從民族工業一方面看，基於國內政局不安定，交通不能恢復，物價漲風極盛，入超過甚，產品不能外銷，致大部分廠家皆瀕於難以維持的困境。加以國人一意崇拜洋貨的壤心理，以用洋貨爲時髦，以用洋貨爲高尙，使寶貴的外匯白白的浪費，予民族工業以銷路黯淡的當頭一棒的打擊。某嚴重的後果便是民族工業的總崩潰，國家經濟的總崩潰。</p>
<p>其實，洋貨雖有價廉物美之美各，但許多却不見得名符其實，它吃香的大部分原因還是撑着USA或British　Made的洋照牌。而且充塞市面的洋貨皆是一些不必需的用品如裝飾品，娛樂品，食用品等，最富吸引力，使人流於奢華糜費而不自覺，進而產生蔑視鄙視國貨之心理，國貨價格雖極低而適合於一般人的經濟能力，亦至漸趨無人間津之境，本來國貨市場的象對是各地城市與廣大的農村，如東能够將此唯一可銷納國貨的龐大市塲把握住，那國貨自然會暢銷，民族工業自然會興路。不過目前復員未竣，交通阻梗，國貨由工廠裏吐出來，其活動的範圍尙離不了就地銷售，以便暫時維持至環境的改善後再行拓展。就上海市來說，上海是全國工業的中樞，密度之高，數量之大，種類之多皆爲全國之冠，在目前此種工業業亦大部分以上海爲消費市場，但是上海却是洋船卸貨的主要港口，上海市民也就先成爲洋貨推銷的對象，道樣一來，洋貨要體取上海市場，加上，市民崇拜洋貨的心理，那脆弱的民族工業就被置於奄奄一息毫無立足點的地位了。</p>
<p>上海機製國貨工廠聯合會曾發起變用國貨運動，大聲疾呼，請國人在不　反經濟原理下，儘可能購用國貨，以糾正奢華，時髦，聯矜的心理，在精神上予民族工業以鼓舞，在實質上予民族工業以延續及度過嚴重危櫗的活力，使其在環境轉佳後得以發芽成長，這是很值得愛國的人們深省的！</p>
<p>記得，筆者剛到上海之時，曾聽到一位市民親口說過一件千眞萬確的事，魷是在勝利以前，日僑以住在虹口較多，那裏有他們的商店，銷售從日本運來的日本貨，那時住在前法租界區域的日僑主婦就經常在早上拿着一個醬油瓶，軋上電車到虹口買本國的醬油去，機說她們並不是因爲住屋附近沒有醬油店，或中國的醬油不好，不合口味；而是她們認爲本國貨有得賣，就應先買本國貨；這是一件很微小的事情，極富意義，柩有價値，這種精神是值得我們取法的。</p>
<h3>工業合理化之起源</h3>
<p>— 紹裘</p>
<p>工業合理化，即「科學的管理法。」美國產業先進，早汪意於此。一九二〇年美國工業聯合協會發起官民協同「驅逐浪費運動」，特就製服·印刷·建築·纖維·製靴·金屬等六大工業爲祥細調查，調查之目的，乃在節省由工業機構之不完全（即現今工業組織容易誘致投機及生產過剩），勞動者之移動，勞資之反目，燃料及動力供給之中斷，財貨需給及生產事情之季節的變動，商品規模之不統一，以及生產工程及原料處理等所發生之若干浪費。</p>
<p>據所發表之調查報吿，浪費可得排除之比例，製服業爲六四％，印刷業五八％，建築工業五三％，織維工業四九％，製靴業四一％，金屬工業二九％，美國全工業平均爲四九％。</p>
<p>至於浪費驅逐運動，以美國商務部所決定之十一項方針爲準繩，而爲有組織的實行。試述其十一項方針於下：</p>
<p>一·排除鐵路輸送上之空耗，講求利用適當設備，及更好方法之積極政策。</p>
<p>二·爲謀經濟的輸送散亂堆積之大量貨物，對於內地河川之交通連絡須大加改良。</p>
<p>三·實行全國電化以行燃料·動力，及勞動之大節的。</p>
<p>四·應緩和由經濟循環所致之盛衰而發生之季節的失業，講求其適當的手段方法。</p>
<p>五·對於政府之統計事務須加以改善，而蒐集綿亘內外關於生產·販賣·存貨·物價等之統計，以爲除去商業上之危險，且抑制懵憤投機之豫測買賣之資料</p>
<p>六·建築工程，採煤業及其他事業，因季節之繁閑，對於勞動者之需要供給有顯著的變化，對此應務求其減輕。</p>
<p>七·規定商品之格式，大小形狀之標準，以排除製造及販賣上之浪費，同時又應將製造方法書，貨物運搬之運單，提單等改爲一定之樣式。</p>
<p>八·爲發見勞動節約及更進步之製造販賣方法起見，應發達工業經濟之科學的調查研究機關</p>
<p>九·以减少附隨於農產物售　之浪費爲目的，實行共同販賣法，同時改良農產物裝卸碼頭之設備。</p>
<p>十·爲謀節省訴訟之耗費起見，應發達商業仲裁制度。</p>
<p>十一·由勞資協調以排除由雙方爭執所發生之耗費。</p>
<p>工業合理化運動展開後，美國行之最力，如魷美國全工業之綜合的生產力之進展觀之，在一九三八年已提高至九八·二％，至一九四〇年已升到一一〇·九％矣。</p>
<h3>加拿大一造紙工業用之水閘</h3>
<p>按類此水閘在魁北克區頗多，一方面調整水位，將造紙用之木材衝至工作場，一方面亦可作原動力。（紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<p>美國</p>
<h3>工廠保健設施</h3>
<p>— 加另</p>
<p>工人的健康直接有關生產能力，故工廠中的保健設施亦屬不可忽略。茲將美國工業保健處於去年調查新裘賽州（New　Jersey）全州工廠一千二百三十七家的保健設施統計節譯出來以供谷界參考。</p>
<p>此一千多家工廠計共有工人六十七萬四千一百零六人。其中以鋼鐵，化工和機械業規模最大，而雇用工人最多的要算運輸，電器和化學工業。雇用工人數在一千人以上的工廠的點全數十分之一，雇用人數在二百五十名以下的工廠數占有三分之二。男女工人總數的比例約爲二對一（二個男工對一個女工）。</p>
<p>（一）廠醫——廠方聘有醫師常駐廠中或每日到廠診療數小時的工廠有一百七十六家，占總數的百分之十四。</p>
<p>（二）護士——廠中聘有護士的計有三百六十四家，占全數的百分之三十。</p>
<p>大的規模較大的工廠都聘有醬師和護士，而小廠均無此設施，故工友能獲得免費醫療的人數的爲總數的百分之六十到八十。廠中護土小姐總數九百七十七名中，約百分之八十爲正式護士學校畢業者，其餘大都爲非畢業坐工唯工作如護士而已。</p>
<p>（三）體格檢查——約有三分之一的工廠（百分之三十五）全體工友均受體格檢查，八分之一的工廠工友部分受檢騐，其他大半均不舉行體格檢查。</p>
<p>（四）藥房間——工廠中備有一室或多室作藥房之用者的全歡占的三分之二。</p>
<h3>美國的失業者</h3>
<p>— 費交</p>
<p>六百萬人領政府津貼</p>
<p>美國失業情况因爲公佈數字的矛盾而形成一種秘密。矛盾的數字是——</p>
<p>據「人口調查局」估計，本年二月全國有二百七十一萬人在找尋職業。這個估計是根據二萬五千個家庭的調查實况加以推測一而得的。</p>
<p>其他的政府機構報吿，在同期中美國全國人民因未得適當工作而領取失業律貼者，的計三百五十萬人，其中一百二十八萬一千人爲退伍軍人。</p>
<p>這兩種統計的相差是八十萬。把其他的因素考慮在內，實際的相差也許更大。所以美國的失業情况大致如次。</p>
<p>最近退伍的軍人，的有二百萬人尙未進入「勞工市塲」，他們有的正在擇業，有的正在休假，有的正在遊胡。這二百萬人如加上過去的三百五十萬人，那末美國領取失業津貼的人數，將共達五百五十萬人。</p>
<p>美國的失業工人大約五人之中只有三人有資格領取失業津貼，其他的或因工作年限太少，或因其他緣故不能領取津貼。有些工人至明年將被取消津貼。這樣一來，實際上的失業人數，將較現有統計再增加五十萬。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說目前全美國的失業工人總數，是六百萬人。</p>
<h3>互商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（一）男工和女工</p>
<p>關於男工和女工之間服務時期方面，在美國曾經有過統計，據說男工在一個工廠裏的最長的時期是二十年至三十年，但女工最長的服務期是五年至八年，國爲有一部份女工在結婚以後，就不願再做工了，這樣看來，似乎女工不及男工，但事實上女工也有她們的優點，那就是一個男工時常喜歡更換他的職業，有時候竟然一年要更換幾次，一個女工，那末可以安心地做上三四年，所以雇用女工，實際上也有利益的，祇不過需要較多的訓練時期而已。</p>
<p>（二）額外工作和夜工</p>
<p>有許多工廠裏，因爲工作繁忙，日間的工人不能應付，於是就有二個辦法；一個就是由日間的工人連做夜工，另一個辦法就是另招一批做夜工的工人，但一般工人都是喜歡日間工作的。如果不是爲了收人的關係，他們不願意在晚上工作，如果在一個工廠裏有兩班工人的話，那末往往有許多工人希望能够做日工，但在一個製造廠的立場看來，如果所製造的貨品，確爲市上所需要，那末用日夜兩班工人，是比較上算的，通常做夜工的工資，比日工較大，但所希望於夜工的工作，可以比日工較少，因爲在晚上做事，終究沒有日間容易，又因爲監督的忽略，往往有許多損壤的貨品，是在晚上造成的，所以要免除損壞，促進工作效能，在做夜工的時候，應該要有完善的監督方法。</p>
<p>（三）工人對企業的興趣</p>
<p>在以前，雇用工人，無非是從企業組織的立場上着想，並不爲工人的利益着想，到了現在，就應該轉變目光，對於工人的福利方面，也應該顧到，在一個企業組織之中，無論做一個股東或董事，或職員或工人，都希望主管當局經營得法，能够獲得利潤，在獲得利潤之之俊，那末希望這利潤能够分佈到每一個人的身上，工人也應該享受這利潤的一部份，工人們得到了這種利益，自然能够對於所服務的工廠產生興趣，努力工作，這個方法，在中國各企業組織向來是實行的，不過就是一個分配得多少的問題罷了。</p>
<p>另外還是一個方法，就是徵求工人的意見，使他們對於製造部份的改良方面，也可以有所貢獻，這在一般情形之下，可以成立一個委員會，如同人福利委員會等，經費方面，由每一工人每月扣付一部份薪金作爲會費，同時再由企業組織方面劃出一點錢來，經費更爲充實，這一個委員會，除了辦理各項福利事業之外，更可以接受工人的對於工作改進的建議，在接到建議之後，那末應該詳加考慮，如果是能够實施的，試驗成功就應該給予工人以相當的酬報，這樣可以使他們對於企業組織發生與趣，工人和企業組織的關係愈密切，感情愈濃厚，那末工作效率也可以增進，這種心理方面的建設，是應該加以考慮的。</p>

<h3>迎着雨季—旅滇小記之一—</h3>
<p>— 林咏泉</p>
<p>由於問行者的介紹，由於那美好的名字—翠湖的令人綢往；到這兒時首先把臨時住所選擇在一家濱湖的小旅館裏—翠湖招待所。爲了想多賞覽些湖上的物事，以及藉湖上的美氛，湖上的翠色，洗浴道一身旅途上的塵灰—多屬精神上的；便把第三樓一間可以望到兩個方向的房間租下。「您瞧啊！」當我被一種貧婪地更是好奇心的支配，忽忙地開開那所有的窗子時；便情不自禁地這樣喊着，時常這樣喊着。</p>
<p>窗外緊沿着長街，緊沿着那一條純用石坂舖成的路—翠湖東路。路對面便是茸綠地翠湖底草坪；湛綠地翠湖底湖水；柔綠地分披於路之兩側的翠湖底斜柳；以及爲這些翠色綠色所互映的每一所亭台與小嶼；橋洞與灣堤都展覽在眼前，影綽在眼前。</p>
<p>因爲正常雨季—這兒的夏季呼爲雨季，冬季爲風季—所以便時常賞覽到湖上的雨景，往往一個大晴天，忽的由不知所自的一縷雲霧中，灑下一注長長的雨髮來，耀眼的陽光，却從四週明鏡似地照射着，勻齊的雨絡，淸晰地斜扯向地面。更從莫名處所的空中，召來一隊小風手，趁熱鬧般把雲吹走着；把雨底庫室推移着，而雲也漸變成黑色，更集成一大塊，如黑幔，如多樹的黑色的山巒。雨便在飄飄灑灑遊戲般時急時歇地落着。</p>
<p>行路人是時常被雨突襲的，當你偶感到一陣小風吹來，而許多的路人在急急忙忙奔跑時，便知道雨來了，同樣每個奔跑人也會很自然地以其激情呼呌着：「雨來了！雨來了！」但迅捷的雨粒，却早已亳不遲疑流星般著落在他們底髮綹上，面額上以及向雨的衣裙上。但有時當他們奔跑到家門，到一所避雨的地方，吁吁喘喘方慶幸可免雨淋時，空中的雲陣，却正好散盡而不知去向。炎熱的陽光又普照着大地。他們忙手忙脚地擦試着雨粒後再擦拭着汗流。</p>
<p>有時也會由一朶薄雲，由於長於張羅的風羣的協助，即刻舖成漫天的陰霾，而落着激情的雨；在情的雨；大面積的雨，幾盡夜的雨，使地面匯成無數河流與沼澤，隔絕了鄉村與城市。</p>
<p>尤其在月夜，在皓潔的月光下，竟時常垂下一大縷明潔地銀鍊般的雨錢。如疏簾，如微務中的春晨一排排纖弱的柳絲後，隱現着園亭與台榭，所不同的，道更有着晰晰之聲，嘩嘩之聲，常予月夜賞雨的人，以無窮幻妙的想像。</p>
<p>這兒的夏季是如此地可愛，如此活潑而多變啊！「您曾到過這兒嗎？曾被這時備的暑天的淸涼迎接過嗎？」</p>
<h3>中膳</h3>
<p>— 更煜</p>
<p>一個秋天的下午，梅芳的家裏來了兩位客人：一位是姨母，一位是姨母的女兒蕙芳，她們面塗脂粉，打扮入時。平時不相往來的表姊妹倆，起始你看看我，我看看你，後來總着母親與姨母之間的談話，不知怎的也就從小事情上談起話來，繼之則互相握手，攀肩，搭背，一同向門外看着，玩着，以至由梅芳領着到附近小學校裏去參觀，便親暱得什麼似的。</p>
<p>「我們那裏的學校有更大的校舍，敎室也不如我們那裏的舒服！」從學校回來的時候蕙芳這樣說。</p>
<p>「那末，你們有沒有操場？」</p>
<p>「我們用不着操場。」</p>
<p>她們都誇說自己的學校好，但都不曾想到有此自己學校更優美的天地，姨母便是爲着女兒入學的問題想來和姊夫商量一下。</p>
<p>姊夫！梅芳的爹是敎害的，在平時，「百無一用是書生」，敎書的人任憑你品格如何淸高，學問如何淵富，終究不容易使人瞧得起他，現在，也許是否極泰來，敎書的老師，雖然繼續在痛苦生活中忍受着，但精神上却漸漸被人尊敬了。「不是麼？這學期的學校大多擠得很，蕙芳還沒有選定學校呢？……」蕙芳的媽便興冲冲地跑到姊姊家來。</p>
<p>吃中飯的時候，姊夫從附近的學校回來，聽說外甥女想要入學，就一口答應替她設法安插，同時因爲來回不便，想在學校裏寄一餐巾膳，照理這一餐中膳該在姊姊家裏吃的，但道不是一兩天的事，蕙芳的媽不好意思出口，而終於談到這個問題。</p>
<p>「學校裏寄中膳的人是有，可是飯菜實在淡薄，恐怕吃不慣吧：」姊失爲事實着想，這樣爽直的說。</p>
<p>「那末，可不可跟姨爹一同吃呢？飯錢，我們照學校一樣的算法，好在只多蕙芳一個人。」蕙勞的媽以爲姊夫是可以答應的。</p>
<p>「不，並不是錢的問題，老實說，我們這裏沒有傭人，人手實在忙不過來，有時發風下雨，沒有人到菜塲去買新鮮小菜，吃飯時祇仗一些　乾菜，呌孩子如何吃得下去？」姊夫熟織蕙芳家裏的生活情形，恐怕沒有好東西給蕙芳吃，引得別人見笑。</p>
<p>「……」蕙芳的媽料不到自己的話會碰了壁，一時沒有話說，兩　嘴　有些聾然，她心裏想：「讀書人的心理眞難捉摸，說話老是一吞一吐的！」</p>
<p>姊夫知道蕙芳的媽生了氣，同時想：「旣是親戚，如果一意推托，也有給鄰居們私議的可能」魷向蕙芳的媽說：「這樣吧，現在天氣熱，就在我們家裏吃着，一待天氣涼快，再想辦法吧。」</p>
<p>「好的，我們一樣出錢包飯。」事情商得了結果，回家的時候，蕙芳的媽心裏想：「尊師，尊師我們爲敎師們都得意得像暴浚戶一樣，原來還是那麼的寒酸！」</p>
<p>第二天，梅芳的媽特地上菜場買菜，蕙芳魷開始在姨爹家裏中膳，道是第一餐的包飯，蕙芳在桌子上掃射了一回，覺得菜餚比昨天的簡單。自然，昨天是客菜，現在是家常菜了，不過，雖然是家常菜，加入了　芳以後，這家常菜比較平日已經是不相同了。</p>
<p>姨爹想：「卽是家常便飯，應該給孩子們學學吃飯的規矩。」自己坐了上首，妻坐在左側，梅芳的年齡長，坐在右側，呌蕙芳坐了下首，蕙芳見到姨爹的態度和昨天不同，她心裏想：「自己是出錢包飯的，莫非表姊是姨爹親生的吧？」她生了氣。</p>
<p>菜是兩葷兩素一湯，湯在中間，兩葷和兩素成了對角綫，　得非常調勻，而黃魚算得最好的菜，蕙芳不待姨爹動筷，早已看中了它，她撩起小手遠遠地專柑黃魚吃，好像要一口裝在肚子裏，姨爹素來不主張孩子搬動自己愛吃的菜餚，也不好意思開口就說，他祇是向她望着，　着，而蕙芳却不以爲意，「我們是出錢的」她心裏道麼想。</p>
<p>第三天，姨母沒有上菜場，因爲昨天買了兩條黃魚，還剩一條，搭些園蔬，桌面上也就湊足了，可是蕙芳的舌尖很敏感，一嚐嘴就覺得貨魚不是新鮮燒的，她向梅芳耳邊砌砌咄咄的耳語，梅芳聽不出，她也魷不說了，姨母看懂了她的意思，可是沒有什麼辦法，蕙芳因爲小菜不配胃口，就少吃了一碗，姨爹說？「吃飯不該太多或太少，每餐有刻板的份量，才是好的衛生習慣』她不懂姨爹說的意思，以爲姨爹說她的飯吃得多了。『我們是出錢的，』她心裏這麼想。</p>
<p>星期六下午，梅芳跟着蕙芳到姨母家去玩，姨母說：「梅芳！好！你來我們家裏吃餐飯去，我們雖然窮苦，却不計較吃多吃少的，』梅芳不明白姨母說的意思，但懂得話裏似乎裏着骨鯁。</p>
<p>「梅芳！你們吃飯的時候，讓臭黃魚給客人吃，請客人坐在末位，到底你們讀書人家裏講規矩！」姨母以爲梅芳不懂，索性明白地戳穿了它。</p>
<p>梅芳不懂究竟怎麼回答是好，讓姨母自己說去，吃完了晚餐，向姨母吿辭而回，一到家裏，便把姨母說的話，吿訴了母親，母親的肚子裏也生了氣，可是因爲自己至親的緣故，沒有表示，讓梅芳自己說去。</p>
<p>星期六的晚上，是姨爹休閑的時間，一聽到了這話，愉快的瞼色立時變成嚴肅。</p>
<p>「梅芳！誰呌你到她們家去？」梅芳沒有回答，姨爹在室內踱着不停。</p>
<p>星期一早晨，梅芳的媽又親上榮塲，準備外甥女的中膳，她的意思是面子第一，既然妹子有這種意思，終得盡量忍氣，不使她們見笑着，那天正午時分，榮　已經擺佈舒齊，梅芳的媽端上了一碟姨爹愛吃的監　葡，重又縮了回去姨爹說：</p>
<p>「監　葡？很好，怎麼端回去呢？」</p>
<p>『蕙芳見了，不又要說臭東西了吧？』梅芳的媽說。</p>
<p>『怕什麼！素富貴行乎當貴，素貧賤行乎貧賤，要好吃天天上館子！』姨爹似乎有些牢騷。</p>
<p>『今天的小菜不是很好嗎？』梅芳也插上一句。</p>
<p>『小孩子不要多說話，我們吃魚肉，你們也吃魚肉；我們咬菜根，你們也咬菜根，把話搬來搬去，播弄是非，有什麼意想呢？』姨爹哼斷了梅芳的話，兩眼狠狠的釘住了她，蕙芳也偷眼向姨爹望着，覺得姨爹眼力的威嚴，她想說話，但有些佰，終於靜穆地吃完了飯，臨走的時候，向姨母輕聲地說：</p>
<p>『媽說過，我們用得起女傭，明天起每天呌女傭送飯來吃，這裏我不再來吃飯了。』說完魷跑到學校裏去，梅芳的媽心裏感到輕鬆，又感到無名的苦痛。</p>
<p>一月以後的一個星期五，是外祖母的忌”，因爲外祖母沒有兒子，祭祀全由女兒承辦，那一天，梅芳的媽把外祖母的遺像供奉起來，她和蕙芳體拜以後，還到學校裏去叫蕙芳來，蕙芳不知道是什麼事，冲冲地跑來，一見到外祖母的像片，呆來地望着，她心裏想：</p>
<p>「這個和靄慈祥的老太太，是自己的外祖母啊！何以梅芳的家裏也供奉着呢？」</p>
<p>「蕙芳！你該向外祖母敬禮！原來你和梅芳是一個外祖母啊！」梅芳的媽這樣解釋着。</p>
<p>蕙芳向外祖母遺　立正鞠躬以後，兩腿一步步退出，想回學校裏去。</p>
<p>『蕙芳！你今天該在這裏中膳！』</p>
<p>蕙芳望着外祖母的遺像，兩腿自然地停住，兩眼也不知不覺地潤濕着了。</p>

<h3>就美學觀點論「比喻」</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如</p>
<p>臧克家先生在「文藝作品中的比喻」一文中舉了許多生動而有興味的例證，說明了比喻在文藝作品中的重要性。此文決不止如臧先生所說對於「看見蝴蝶呼妹妹，望見月亮喊姐姐，把比喻的身價弄得太下賤了的人」「有一點用處」，對於從事文藝創作的靑年們，也誠然是一個南針。</p>
<p>比喻在修辭學上，在文藝創作的技術上，確有其重要的地位，但從美墨的觀點看來，「比喻」却是一個意義暧昧的名詞。一般人對於比喻的解釋，只及於經驗的，常識的意義，未能理論地科學地加以分析與研究。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>且就臧先生所舉的例子來看：「手如柔黃，膚如凝脂」是比喻，這是以一件東西來表現另一件東西；「好似誰欠了你二百錢」是比喻，這是以一個事實來表現一種表情；「左右手食拇指那麼湊成一個圓圈」是比喻，這是以一種手指的姿式來表現一個心裏的事物。不論這些例于是以什麼來表現什麼，但總是以一個爲大家所共同習知的事物來表現某個人心裏所見的特定的事物（由直觀所產生的心象）。</p>
<p>每個人都有他的生活歷史和個性，於是對於同一事物也必然各有不同的心象。例知，對於共同的時間的直觀，在你是「日月如梭」，在他是「光陰如白駒過隙」，在另一個常與寂寞同在的人却是「度日如年」。</p>
<p>比喻是心象的表現，也魷是直觀的表現。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>爲什麼要用比喻？</p>
<p>是爲了使自己有更明確的直觀與心象（即是表現），尤其是爲了使自己的直觀與心象能感染別人（即是傳達）。</p>
<p>而文藝作品的目的便在於表現與傳達，因此，比喻的任務也就是文藝創作的任務。比喻，就是文藝創作。談比喻，就是談文藝創作的基本原理，也就是談文藝創作的全體。</p>
<p>劇本「日出」（曹禺著）是文藝作品，也是一個比喻，它比喻的是陰暗面的都市生活；詩「罪惡的黑手」（臧克家著）是文藝作品，也是一個比喻，它此喻的是腐敗的宗敎的眞面目。就外延言，比喻之大，可至如此。</p>
<p>「花」是一個單字，也是一個比喻，它比喻的是一種植物的器官；「痛苦」是一個名詞，也是一個比喻，坩比喻的是一種生物因受某種刺激而有的特殊感覺。「恰似一江春水向東流」是一句詞，也是一個比喻，它比喻的是一種情緒的性質與量。就外延言，比喻之小，可至如此。</p>
<p>就外延言，文藝作品與比喻自然不能無別，苟就內包而言，文藝作品魷是比喻，比喻就是文藝作品，兩者之間不能有所差別。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>比喻，也可以用「形象性」來代替，形象地表現，也就是用比喻來表現。「看見過嗎，夜里把住雞　捉雞，他們被捉來魷是這樣。」是形象化的手法，也是比喻的手法。比喻，也可以用「典型性」來代替，阿Q是一個典型，同時也不能不是一個比喻，他比喻的是近似這一型的中國人全體。</p>
<p>比喻，形象，典型，這一串文藝理論上習用的名詞都只是對文藝作品的片面的看法。文藝作品就某一側面看來，就是比喻，就是形象，就是典型，但魷全體來看，就不外是表現與傳達。</p>
<p>把文藝作品的二個片面的性質提出來研究不是無益的事，但如僅局限於道個片面的研究則會不免陷於謬誤。盲人之「捫盤扣燭」，便是錯失於片面的觀察。因此，當我們研究到「比喻」這側面時，我們千萬不要忽略了對全體的研究，不要忽略了最基本的「表現」與「傳達」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　117</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見三個鞠躬，行禮如儀之後，又照日人風俗，問候幾句，這才把書接下，捧在手裏，原來近術剛才所念一大段正是「國語」卷第六，桓公與管子，討論南伐北討，東征西勦的侵略計劃。那「轟鷄脚」等等，大的就是「桓公日」等等。他爲什麼要選出這一段書來誦續呢？其用意大槪魷是要呌元老派叫瞭，他們這次不顧一切，發動侵略，預備征服世界，乃是根據聖典上「五覇」之一，齊桓公的侵略政策。如今萍子沒有捉來，也只好讓鶴見去轉達了。</p>
<p>他們要把侵略計劃傳達給元老派，難道還怕沒有人正式的代表說話？這就說明了日人行動，一切皆「詭」。他這一番舉動，可說是一個小小苦肉計，也可說是「君子欺以共方」的辦法，所以開接掄揚比直接游說有效得多。而日西園寺年齡已高，又是超然派，只要知道有人傳說他們這羣東西，還能守住聖經的敎訓，也就不來認眞了。</p>
<p>鶴見把道一段書，逐字看完；大意雖有些明白，苦於中國古文上，沒下功夫，竟有一大堆字不認得，而文句又是那麼蒼老間賅，竟有些「山東人吃麥冬」的意思，就是不懂。當時只能向近　說明，書上文字古奧，祇能明白一點大意。那近衛聽了，竟描摹古劇角色的動作，拈鬚呵呵大笑。這裏「拈」字用的不妥，因他那一條綫的小仁丹鬍鬚，短的無法可拈，只能空做一個拈的表情而已。</p>
<p>「鶴見君」，他這才瞧了鶴見一眼，「爲軍人之道，不讀「賽典」，不能成大器！……本人知道你是一個有用的人才，所以良言奉勸，往後一邊建功立業，一邊也要多聖賢書籍；……像本人現在「日理萬機」公餘之暇，也要逐日誦讀一兩篇賽典，這就是孟夫子說的，「吾善養吾浩然之氣」的一個法門。」……</p>
<p>近衡的話，這裏只能簡單的記下了這幾句。其實，在當日鶴見所聽的，百倍之多也不止，他竟囉囉哆哆，說了半個鐘頭，而且所用語句，大半文言。所謂文言，乃是中國唐宋以前，山中國搬運過去，日太式的古體語句，當中不知加上了多少個「之乎也者」的虛字眼，賣弄他的文學。這一段戲劇式的塲面，弄過之後，這才問着鶴見，何時從大陸回來？因何回來？因何要參加黑能會？等等。最後才同到正文，呌鶴見把這天半夜在「新綠」舞　，過見萍子的事，據實說明。</p>
<p>鶴見是個什麼脚色，何等機警，聽了近衛口氣，早就知道他在舞廳的一舉一動，和萍子的一問一答，必已被人探攝了去，道時答對，絕對不能說謊，也不能增多或减少一字，只將烟匣的秘密，和車中的電訊，隱了下來，把其餘前前後後的事，一一說出。不過心下十分奇怪，這些德國的第五縱隊人物，何以如此厲害。回想當時，他同萍子的言談動作，似乎絕對愼密，而且當時似乎時時提備，在近身邊可能的距離以內，並無一人來往哩。</p>
<p>鶴見一邊說着話，近衛一邊閉目養神，側耳靜聽。鶴見說畢，只見近衛一點手，招了一個侍妾來，輕輕說了一句，那侍妾立即從圖門側邊轉過去，幾分鐘後，取出一疊文件來。奉給近衛，近衛接過，翻了幾頁，就把那蠱文件，呌侍妾遞給鶴見。一面又對鶴見說，「你倒是一個誠實而又機警的靑年，在本人而前，沒有欺僞，很可嘉獎，只是據這報吿，那烟匣中的小紙，上面並無看得見的字跡，是用特制墨水寫的，從這剛才補上來的報吿，說明紙形變了，並且又有活動鉛筆字跡，不像中村萍子的筆跡，鉛筆墨色，粗細，與係所用的，一式一樣，你對這個問題，如何解釋？而且紙上的文字，好像並無深意，是否你的僞造？……你且先把這些報吿看看明白，再據實回答！」</p>

<h3>打風</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>生活不安定，物價日漲，政治上也待澄淸，各地烽火未息，勝利來已一年餘，在這樣的局面下，人人苦悶煩燥，不免肝火旺，脾氣暴，打風之所以盛行，可說良有以也。</p>
<p>至於運動塲上的全木武行，逮在戰前，即已屢見不鮮，這真是中國體育史上可恥的一頁。外國人講Sport　manship，而我們却非打個明白不可，像十這樣的運動方式，不如乾脆就打架門毆，何必還用球賽來魄幌子呢？</p>
<p>上海七大學足球聯賽，前天復旦對滬江第，一塲，便發生了拳傘交加混打人的一幕，以後是否還繼續比賽，假使繼續的話，球員，觀衆，恐怕都得全副鋼盔鋼甲，否則難免沒有頭破血流的無妄之災。</p>
<p>球賽的目的在運動，在鍜鍊體格，勝負並不是目的，勝負也不應該看得比什麼都重的，倘使大家能有此認識，就不會再發生這一類不愉快的事件了。其實這道理誰都懂得，但誰也不肯淡泊勝負，求勝心切，自然往往會流於越軌行動。</p>
<p>上海爲全國觀瞻所繫，七大學能不能在這點上特別加以約束，發揮球場上的道德，以作各地的表率呢？</p>
<p>活劇</p>
<h3>原來如此</h3>
<p>— 安</p>
<p>在十五路無軌電車中，突然一個尖銳的聲音呌了起來。</p>
<p>「掱手！摸袋袋！」</p>
<p>喊的人是一個年約十八九歲的學徒。</p>
<p>「儂講啥末事？小赤　，常心吃耳光！」</p>
<p>說這話的是一個身穿馬褲呢大衣的人，年的三四十歲，高個子，險上露着兇相。</p>
<p>你還要賴，鈔界已經給你摸一出來了，手給我抓住了，還要想賴？</p>
<p>「滾你的蛋，瞎三話四，要敲你耳光了！」那男子舉起了手，做着要打人的樣子。</p>
<p>這時全車的人，都注意到他們兩人。</p>
<p>「這般掱手，眞是可惡，專門在人多時摸人家袋袋。」一個靑年說。</p>
<p>這時，一個穿西裝的靑年，指着那個男子問道：</p>
<p>「你做啥生意？呌啥名字？」</p>
<p>「我要你管，你啥人？好管我？」那男子答道。</p>
<p>「我怎樣不能管你？你做啥生意？」穿西裝的走上前一步，加緊追問着。</p>
<p>「我做皮，皮生意的。」那男子開始躡蠕的回答着。</p>
<p>「身份證有哦？拿出來看」。</p>
<p>「我忘—忘記帶出來了。」</p>
<p>「到行裏去。」西裝靑年用手提着那男子的領子，一面回過頭來問那學徒：</p>
<p>「你袋袋裏有多少錢？」</p>
<p>「有六七萬。」</p>
<p>在這時候，電車已經到了龍門路車站，停了下來，賣票隨手開門。</p>
<p>「行裏去，行裏去。」西裝背年提着那男子的領子，一面又對那學徒說：</p>
<p>「你也一齊去。還有那位願意做見證，一齊去哦？」</p>
<p>全車的人，你看看我，我看看你，沒有一個人回答，也沒有一點聲音。</p>
<p>西裝靑年抓着那男子和學徒一齊下了車，我因爲到了目的地，也隨着下車。</p>
<p>這時西裝靑年仍是聲勢洶洶，拉着那男子及那個學徒模樣的人緊跟在後面。</p>
<p>走不多步，只見那男子扭了扭身子，說道：</p>
<p>「老三，好啦！好敖手了。」</p>
<p>西裝青年向後面看了一看，便放了手。而那學徒更上前了一步，三人走在一排。</p>
<p>我感到奇怪，便跟在他們後面，往東走去。</p>
<p>走不了多遠，只見前面有兩個人，跑得很快的走過來，看見他們三人，打了一個招呼，一面說道：</p>
<p>「今天生意不錯，很得手。」</p>
<p>同時五個人走在一起了。我一認：原來道兩個人就是剛才在電車上罵掱手的兩個人。</p>
<p>我仔細一想，原來道五個人都是混蛋，在在電軍串演一幕趣劇，故弄玄虛，引起乘客的注意，而乘機另行下手摸竊的。</p>
<p>原來如此。手段愈來愈高明了！</p>

<p>印捕之所以被稱爲「阿三」，或「紅頭阿三」，據筆者所知，在往昔租界時代，警察局俗稱巡捕房，裏面管理印捕的捕頭，大率由英籍的西捕祖任，對印捕用英語說話，第一句話常用I　saay……大意說「喂」—引人注意開始談話的表示，在當初英語不一十分普遍的時候，一般居住租界內的市民，不諳英語，聽見西補與印捕談話，開口就是“I　say”，誤以爲印捕名字，I　say音與一阿三雷同，於是以誤傳訛，大家看見印捕，戲呼「阿三」。</p>
<p>現在租界收回，警權統一，不同國籍的印捕·越捕……等等，相繼辭退。印捕「阿三」的稱呼，亦已成爲歷史的名詞。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織　10</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>南郭先生</p>
<p>西樂隊是隨　風東漸而來的新產物，上海人家辦婚喪大事，都免不了中西樂隊並用，因由樂多係絲竹細樂，而西樂却聲調雄壯，在紅白儀仗中夾雜地敲打起來，雖是不倫不類。但却造成了熱鬧異常的氣氛。這於排闊的人家是認爲頗中下懷的，在上月有許多西樂隊是隨時受僱的。他們都有一式的制服制帽，這是　中樂隊整齊的地方。至於奏調的是否「中聽」，事賞上却無人過問了。</p>
<p>爲了婚喪禮式都得擇日，在同一吉日中大家都需要西樂隊，頓時有應接不暇之慨。樂隊中人抱定來者不拒生義而生意接下來之後又歡人數有限，不數分配；於是便異想天開，將原有的兩班分爲三班，其所缺欠的名額，却招僱老弟兄丐流濫竽充數，於是原有的三班可擴充而爲五班，原有四班的可擴充而爲六班。通常每班隊員八九人，現在却以基本隊伍六人作爲一隊，所缺的二三人由丐流充數。後來此種風氣日漸流行，丐幫中人居然有一部份專做此項臨時短工的，此輩必須年靑而身而齊整，決非吾人所想像的衣服襤褸的丐流可比。所以穿起樂隊制服來，居然也可魚目混珠，再分配給他們各種不三不四的樂器，參加行列出發，自然誰也看不出破綻來了。</p>
<p>這種滑稽劇的演出，自然完全是騙錢的勾當，喪喜人家按照樂隊人數給錢，僱用丐流自可給付較少的代價。這當中的利潤自歸樂隊負責人所得，而此輩年靑丐流雖終年跟踪吹打，可是永遠沒有機會學會一種吹奏的技能。他們永遠是「南郭先生」，想起了這樣的人生，着實是够無聊的了。幫中人業此者稱爲「擺炮」。凡充「擺炮」者因此類短工時有時無，一曝十寒，故生活十分潦倒。但賴之以免凍餒，又無其他門路可走，棄之終覺可惜，事負昂藏七尺軀，也算是丐幫中的可憐蟲了！</p>
<h3>怒髮衝冠並無其事</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>「怒髮衝冠」已成了一句極通俗的形容詞。但是誰曾處的看見過人類的頭髮因情感的衝動而直　起來呢？科學地講起來，「怒髮衝冠」僅是一句形容詞而已。其實，一隻憤怒的狗或猫倒眞的會毛髮直暨。但是這是一種自動的動作，因爲在牠們的毛根的四週，都環繞着一小圈不隨意筋肉，（魷是活動力非動物本身所能控制的筋肉，如人類的心，胃等的肌肉，都屬此頻）。當他們憤怒或受驚時，血液內的副腎分泌液便增多了，刺激毛根下的不隨意筋肉收縮起來，於是他們的毛便根根朝天了。人類的髮根的四週，並無此種筋肉，所以無法表演「怒髮衝冠」。但是人類的頭髮偶而也會豎直起來，那便是靜電相吸的結果，可是這種情形，碰到的機會非常之少。</p>
<p>頭頂上的頭髮並無生機，有生繼的部份是埋在頭皮下長的八分之一吋的髮根。所以你要使頭髮生長得好一點，在頭上用功夫是無效力的。必須要設法促進髮根的健康與活力。</p>
<p>頭髮的壽命，平均的四年到七年。當髮很四週的腺胞停止活動時，這根頭髮的生命就終止了。可是短時間內腺胞就會重新活動，再生一根新的頭髮以代之。如果，腺胞永久停止活動了，那末，便造成了不雅觀的禿頂。</p>
<p>有的人認爲剃頭曾使頭髮長得快，有的人認爲剃頭是禿頂的原因之一——他們的「證據」是：女子很少是禿頂，禿頂的男子却很多。這就是因爲：男子一生剃頭的次數太多，而女子割棄靑絲的機會則無。懷有這種錯誤觀念的人，他們未曾際解：掌握頭髮生機的部份是髮根而非外露之髮。剃頭當然影響不到髮根，所以頭髮的生長或死亡，與剪髮是無關的。至於男子的禿頂，除了前述的腺胞停止活動的原因之外，原有一個遺傳的原因。禿頂是遺傳的因子，與色賈同屬於性連遺傳。男子所受的禿頂遺傳要比女子大一倍，所以禿頂的男子就比女子爲多了。</p>
<p>中國稗史記載伍子胥過昭關，說他一夜裏憂慮得頭髮完全變白。這當然也是一種誇大的形容。但是憂慮確能影響頭髮的生長。憂慮對於全身的健康都有影響，且可能使內分泌腺阻塞，影響到頭髮的生長。同樣的，憂慮也會使頭髮逐漸灰白。</p>
<p>許多關於鬼怪的傳說，都說人死後，頭髮和髭鬚都仍舊能够繼續生長。這種傳說是不確實的，人一死，體內各種組織便完全立即停止活動了。最先停頓的是心臟身體的其他各部份可能延遲半小時或稍多的時間，但是都短促得很。有時候，人死之後，耽擱了幾天才入殮，這時，我們確實看到：死人的髭鬚好像此彌留時長了些。其實，這是一種錯覺，由於死人的筋肉與皮膚的收縮，使髭鬚顯得特別突出，於是便造成「長一些」的錯覺。</p>

<h3>慨乎言之</h3>
<p>— WW</p>
<p>生不用封萬戶侯，但願金條一笆斗，某公到任，如跳加官之先則手示「廉潔」，繼則「無私」，後則「爲國」，手示旣罷，也魷收回擱在一邊，迨面具一脫，眞相畢露。阿舅，小姨，外甥，內僅，……甚至奶媽的兒子都先後安插，公事「公」辦，一帆風順，公嘗謂諸親曰：撈吾撈，以及人之撈，誠慨乎言之矣。</p>
<h3>一兩黃金四兩福</h3>
<p>— 肅亢石</p>
<p>金價又在跳了，其所得的後果，當然又要剌激物價！</p>
<p>在中國的古諺說：「一兩黃金四兩福」，這是形容黃金多麼的「貴重」，有福氣的人，才能「藏黃金」，「戴金器」，反之沒有福氣的人，會有「抬到黃金變爲銅」的神話，所以黃金之身價確然是高貴的！</p>
<p>可是在勝利後的今年，各種物價在跳，而居爲老大的黃金，尙不至像物價的瘋在，所以在勝利前的一兩黃金，還給人「重視」，可是在今年呢，一兩黃金，連一套西裝都不夠買，尤其是車夫娘姨，都戴着極大的戒指飾物，那麼這句「一兩黃金四兩福」的古諺，在這年頭早已「打破」掉了！</p>
<p>上海的投機市塲，做黃金，做股票，做公債，做食糧，隨時隨地，掀風作浪，確有獨到之能，然而今年的投機市場，獨感黃金乏味工這不能不歸功於官方的拋售抑制，然而一般的物價，允以「衣食」兩件事，瘋狂的高漲，卻沒法「抵制」，所以金價和物價得不到戰前的「比例」。</p>
<p>現在商人方面，因爲戰亂的頻仍，物價的太高，生產的不够，實銷的呆滯，游資的充斥，法幣的貶值，在種種因素之下，大衆的心理之中，還是以黃金過廉，在「存錢存貨不如存金」的觀念下，黃金怎不發生搜購的騷動呢？雖然有「拋售」，予「抑制」，但是一句的「歸咎」，就是「金價和物價不得平衡」的所趨！</p>
<p>可是最可怕的，是金價跳了之後，「物價」會跟上在竄，眞使人感到十分的頭痛，芸芸芸衆生，眞象係行者截了金　帽，越戰越緊，頭也痛得要爆裂了呢！</p>

<p>杭州之虎，汶川熊貓，雖是一害一寶，但他們不能再度其山中悠遊之歲月則一也。</p>

<h3>幸與不幸</h3>
<p>— 懋英</p>
<p>攤販風潮，弄得人心不安，暴徒無法無天，到處搗毀店舖的玻璃窗，而致玻璃商乘「機」抬價，倍上加倍；在被害店家說：這是一筆意外的「損失」，在破璃商人說；這是一筆意外的「收穫」！上海地方就多的是這種意外！</p>
<h3>奚足詬病</h3>
<p>— 方來</p>
<p>國營事業，與民爭利，與論時加責難，其實民主政治，理應以人民之意志爲意志。今日中國人民，頗多志在發財，政府自當遵照民意，以發財爲國策，仿陶朱之遺風，孳孳爲利，與民同發，坆不失爲民主政治，奚足詬病？</p>
<h3>大英國旗</h3>
<p>— 介生</p>
<p>深圳事件中，英軍竟「越界」，「亂毆」，機槍亂掃」，而港督及警備司令費斯丁將軍則答謂「該士兵當時並未奉到命令放搶，僅係誤觸槍機而發。」我們對於英軍的嚴守命令，固已欣佩之至，但還得請問將軍：「亂掃」是吾爲一誤再誤所致？</p>
<p>又該英軍曾謂：「英邊一百碼都算英界！」不錯，「越界」以後，這一百碼是「旣成事實」，「邊外」仍然有個一百碼。一百碼，一百碼……於是，太英帝國的國旗就日夜不落了。</p>

<p>B，照樣也放出二氣化碳氣呢？</p>
<p>C，抑或並不放出二氣化碳氣呢？</p>
<p>（七）說來說去，似乎一切暖房用暖爐中，還是以電暖爐最爲乾淨，合衛生，雖然化費一點。但想請問一下：從那灼熱得發紅發白的發熱金屬絲，與我們朝着它而感覺溫暖的面龐之間，主要的是憑那一種傳熱方法呢？</p>

<h3>Accelerated Progress in Constitution Draft Review: All Review Committees Hold Simultaneous Meetings; New Constitution Expected to be Promulgated on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Once the National Assembly reaches an agreement on amendments to the draft constitution, it will be smoothly completed. The Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on the 13th. If discussions are not completed by the 19th, the session will be extended by ten days, closing on the 29th. The new constitution may be promulgated on New Year's Day of the 36th year [1947].</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Presidium of the National Assembly has scheduled its 14th meeting for 10:00 AM on the 9th to discuss the following issues: (1) Establishment of preliminary subgroups within the Review Committees; (2) Scope and agenda of the Joint Review Committee and the Comprehensive Review Committee; (3) Procedures for each Review Committee to handle proposals, written opinions, verbal opinions, and extensive feedback.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The time and location for the meetings of the various Constitution Draft Review Committees of the National Assembly on the 9th have been decided, and are listed below: First Review Committee Conveners Meeting, 4:00 PM, Administrative Yuan.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The second meeting of the conveners of the Second Constitution Draft Review Committee was held at 2:00 PM on the 8th in the First Lounge of the second floor of the Assembly Hall. After deciding on the meeting schedule for the 9th, the proposals and opinions collated and summarized by the committee secretary were discussed. The meeting adjourned at 3:50 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in Shanghai yesterday. When reporters inquired about his views on the constitutional amendment proposal, he stated: "I believe that in addition to stipulating general elections, the constitution should also adopt a system of occupational representation, and I advocate adding a chapter on social security."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] On the 8th, two more National Assembly representatives registered: Gan Ruzhou, representing occupational groups, and Tan Hu, representing the Youth Party. Including previous registrations, the total number of representatives registered has reached 1,675. The National Government officially announced 1,744 representatives, with only 69 unregistered. Therefore, the number of representatives registered and attending the Assembly has reached 96 percent.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The National Government issued an order on the 8th stating that Yang Aiyuan, the military representative to the National Assembly, is unable to attend due to illness. His vacancy will be filled by Zhu Shouguang. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Presidium Holds Tea Party to Host Review Committee Conveners, Requesting Accelerated Review of Constitution Draft so that it Can Be Submitted to the Assembly on the 13th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The National Assembly Presidium hosted a tea party for the conveners of the various Review Committees at 4:15 PM on the 8th in the First Lounge on the second floor of the Assembly Hall. Attendees included Sun Ke, Zou Lu, Wang Chonghui, Bai Chongxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Jiang Juntian (represented by Lu Yi'an), Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Fu Sinian, Bai Yunti, Bai Haifeng, Huang Zhengqing, Chen Yiyun, Ren Peixun, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen, and 68 others. Sun Ke delivered a speech stating that the purpose of the tea party was to discuss the procedures for the meeting. He then reported the decisions made at the 13th Presidium meeting as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The conveners of each Review Committee are requested to actively conduct review work during the four days from the 9th to the 12th, holding meetings in the morning and afternoon, in accordance with the Assembly's agenda, so that the first reading can begin at the Assembly on the 13th and conclude on the 19th, closing the session as scheduled.</p>
<p>(2) The quorum for the Review Committees is set at one-tenth of the total number of members in each committee.</p>
<p>(3) Approximately 400 proposals have been compiled into eight volumes, which will be printed and distributed to each Review Committee as they are completed.</p>
<p>(4) Each Review Committee will establish a "Preliminary Organization Group" composed of the nine conveners and ten representatives publicly elected by the Review Committee. This group will summarize and list the proposals and extensive opinions, formulate specific amended clauses, compare them with the Constitution chapter by chapter, and submit them to the Review Committee. Major or fundamental changes should be simultaneously notified to the Presidium for transfer to the Comprehensive Review Committee. The conveners may meet every evening to review the progress of the Review Committee.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the issue of journalists attending the review sessions for reporting, the conveners may, at their discretion, hold closed meetings when necessary and ask the journalists to temporarily leave the venue.</p>
<p>(6) Each Review Committee does not need to wait for all proposals and extensive opinions to be delivered before starting to organize, arrange, and submit them for discussion.</p>
<p>After Sun Ke finished speaking, Hong Lanyou continued, saying that although the deadline for accepting proposals was set at midnight on the 9th, they are still arriving in a continuous stream. It is planned to compile all of them into eight volumes, plus a general introduction, all of which are being printed as quickly as possible and will be delivered to each representative. As for the oral and written extensive opinions submitted by the representatives at the Assembly, totaling hundreds of thousands of words, organizing and classifying them is particularly difficult. The production efficiency of the printing press has reached its limit, so it has been decided to first distribute copies to the relevant Review Committees by mimeograph.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Kuomintang representatives Zou Lu, Ren Zhuoxuan, and Social Democratic Party representative Li Junban raised opinions regarding the speeches and impromptu opinions of the representatives at the Review Committee. Sun Ke replied that impromptu opinions can still be discussed and submitted at the Review Committee. However, if the speaking time is too long, or if the opinions are the same as those already expressed at the Assembly, the chairman of the Review Committee can exercise their due authority to weigh and handle the situation to avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>Kuomintang representative Huang Shaogu raised questions regarding the technical aspects of proposal allocation and the nature and authority of the Review Committee. Hong Lanyou, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen responded separately: (1) The Secretariat will provide a general classification and summary of the proposals and extensive opinions, presented as a written catalog. Each Review Committee can contact the relevant groups at any time regarding a particular issue. (2) The work of the First to Eighth Review Committees is primarily based on the proposals, referring to extensive opinions, to evaluate each amendment and decide on the most suitable one to be submitted to the Assembly for responsible review. (3) The work of the Ninth (Comprehensive) Review Committee is to discuss and resolve important or fundamental amendment opinions and issues with more constraints. At this point, Kuomintang representative Zhong Tianxin proposed canceling the provisions for the two sessions of the Joint Review Committee and the Comprehensive Review Committee in the agenda, advocating that they be convened ad hoc when necessary, and that the Review Committees be given sufficient time to meet and discuss.</p>
<p>Yan Fen suggested that organizing and summarizing proposals and opinions is administrative work, not review, and that it is unnecessary to form a Preliminary Organization Group, as electing members would only waste time.</p>
<p>Lin Bin also reported that the Second Review Committee had already been carrying out this task by the conveners and secretaries, and the progress was quite rapid, all advocating that there was no need to establish a Preliminary Organization Group.</p>
<p>After discussion, it was decided to submit these two issues to the Presidium meeting on the morning of the 9th for reconsideration. Finally, Hong Lanyou announced the meeting times and locations for each Review Committee on the 9th, and the meeting adjourned at 6:40 PM.</p>

<h3>Army Joint Grand Exercises: Infantry, Artillery, and Paratrooper Performances are All Extremely Realistic; National Assembly Representatives from All Regions are Delighted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The joint army-air grand exercises were held at 9:00 AM on the 8th at Jietuo Village outside Zhongshan Gate in the suburbs of Nanjing to welcome the National Assembly representatives. The General Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense for the Army and Air Force were extremely busy with preparations and exercises beforehand, and even conducted rehearsals all day on the 7th, rushing to handle various related reception matters at night. Therefore, when people arrived at the exercise site this morning, they saw that the arrangements were well-organized and orderly. The seats for the audience were all on the ground, with a box of snacks for each person for a picnic. Today, the capital's weather was clear and sunny, and thousands of people bathed in the sunshine to watch this realistic exercise. First, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense gave a speech, followed by Chief of Staff Shen Zhuangyu reporting on the exercise items. The exercise began at 10:00 AM, with Tang Enbo serving as the supervisor, Liu Zhenqing as the commander-in-chief, Mao Yingchu and Luo Yingde as the Air Force commanders, Ma Shigong as the paratrooper instructor, Jin Zhen as the artillery instructor, and Li Ziliang and Tan Zhenduo as the infantry commanders. The exercise programs were: (1) Army-Air Coordination; (2) Infantry-Artillery Coordination; (3) Paratrooper Team landing behind enemy lines and attacking enemy airfields. The participating units were the 5th Group of the Air Force, an infantry battalion, an artillery battalion, a signal platoon, and the paratrooper corps. The army-air coordination and infantry-artillery coordination exercises were completed at 11:30 AM. The parachute jumping exercise was held at Minggugong Airfield. After the audience arrived one after another, it began immediately, completing from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. All the exercises were extremely realistic, earning endless praise from representatives from all regions. Minister Bai, Chief of Staff Chen, and Commanders Zhou and Tang were all on hand to receive guests, explain, and clarify. They dispersed around 2:00 PM. Minister Bai's speech was approximately as follows: "Today, the Ministry of National Defense is holding army-air exercises here to welcome the National Assembly representatives. You representatives are the representatives of all the people, and the army is the armed force of the people, the army of the people. Therefore, inviting you here today can be said to be inviting you to inspect your own armed forces, your own army. The National Assembly began in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], and after several twists and turns, it was not realized. It is only now that it can be held, and soon we will have a constitution. If we want to guarantee that the constitution can be implemented, we must first establish a strong military force to consolidate national defense, so that we can resist foreign aggression. The evolution of military affairs has now reached the atomic energy era. The Ministry of National Defense has a National Defense Science Research Association that is constantly conducting research, and we hope that scientific national defense can be realized soon."</p>
<h3>National Army Recaptures Tangji in Huaiyin</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The National Army north of Huaiyin, after defeating the Communist army at Xujiazibo on the evening of the 6th, continued to advance. At the same time, they advanced west from Huaiyin and recaptured Tangji. The Communist army transferred more than three regiments of troops from Lianshui, Shuyang, and Siyang to re-invade Lianghuai, but ultimately failed. It is reported that the Communist army within Lianshui is wavering.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Crosses Songhua River: 4,000 Flee to Liaoyang</h3>

<h3>Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui Leave Beiping for Shanghai This Morning to Discuss the Social Democratic Party's Organizational Structure</h3>

Liang read a written statement, first saying: "We are going to Shanghai this time because Zhang Junmai and Wu Xianzi sent urgent telegrams today urging us to discuss everything in person. Generally speaking, Shanghai knows that we have the intention to withdraw from the party, and deeply feels that this matter is entirely due to the unsoundness of the party, and there is an intention to reorganize it. Because of our many years of friendship, we are very willing to contribute some ideas on reorganization."</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] Hu Haimen said: The Social Democratic Party's organizations at all levels are still in the preparatory stage, and this trip to Shanghai will discuss the establishment of a formal party organization.

<p>Overseas Chinese Merchants May Build Their Own Markets</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 7th] Although the Philippine Ministry of Finance's Filipinization of Markets Bill was strongly opposed by our embassy, the bill still gives Filipinos priority in renting market stalls, which will effectively eliminate overseas Chinese from markets throughout the Philippines. According to the embassy, overseas Chinese merchants will ultimately have to build their own markets, and all overseas Chinese merchants will continue to occupy market stalls, deliberately resisting the bill to test whether the bill has any constitutional validity when it is implemented next year.</p>

The National Army was forced to fight back. The Communist army launched several assaults, all of which were repelled. At dawn, the Communist army occupied the high ground in the East and West Huicun, forming an encirclement. The National Army, due to the disparity in numbers, withdrew to Shanxian north of the village. The Communist army increased its support and launched several fierce attacks, but failed. By about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, the main force of the Communist army turned east again, attempting to bypass Bai Shui Jing and Zhangjia Ling. The National Army, in addition to occupying the high ground in Zhangjia Ling, withdrew to Shangpanshi.</p>

<h3>On-the-Spot Account of the Army and Air Force Exercises: Our Reporter Zhang Ming; Minister Bai Says People's Representatives Inspect People's Armed Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Bai and General Chen both wore high-top leather boots, the former yellow and the latter black, appearing in the plaza of Jietuo Village at the exercise site in the guise of hosts, shaking hands and greeting guests at any time, and explaining everything, full of spring breeze. Although he was in military uniform, it diluted a lot of the solemn atmosphere. The seats for the audience were arranged very delicately. Although they were sitting on the ground, the ground was sloped, with a military blanket on each level. After sitting down, it was the same as the grandstand of a stadium, and everyone had a box of snacks, which could be described as everyone being happy.</p>
<p>When Minister Bai gave his speech, he was on the rostrum opposite the guests, but the broadcasting equipment was behind the guests. When they heard the sound, everyone turned to the back, while the speaker was in front.</p>
<p>The Relief Administration sent a large number of rations, so the tide of receiving rations stirred up "peace and order" in the venue.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the exercise, three bombers formed a small team, totaling two teams, coming from the sky. Chief of Staff Shen Zhuangyu reported that these were "enemy" planes attacking. Only when he turned around, five planes, three in front and two in the back, were coming head-on. Then the "enemy" planes began to drop bombs. The Chief of Staff's report: "Entering one by one, dropping bombs one by one." The listeners laughed. In the infantry-artillery coordination program, the sound of artillery and machine guns resounded through the mountains, as if they were on the battlefield, but the reaction was a burst of relaxed laughter. The shells exploded on the hillside and caught fire, the raging fire burning the weeds.</p>
<p>During the paratrooper exercise, the smoke screens were particularly beautiful, with purple, red, yellow, and green, covering half the sky, like a vast fog. When the paratroopers began to descend, beautiful black and white flowers spit out from the strong fuselage, weaving out spots of flowers in the clear sky, the colors beautiful, just like a moving pattern painting.</p>
<p>On the ground, Minister Bai specially introduced the identity of Commander Tang to reporters, saying: "Today, he is the only one singing the opera."</p>
<p>After the exercise, the reporter interviewed Secretary-General Hong, who said: "I think Minister Bai's words were the best: People's representatives inspect people's armed forces."</p>
<p>Jietuo Village is in the suburbs of Nanjing, a 40-minute car ride from Zhongshan Gate. So today the road to Jietuo Village was crowded with cars, a collection of the best cars in Beijing. (December 8)</p>

<h3>UNRRA Director Issues Statement: Lifts Suspension of Shipments to China, and Stipulates Monthly Shipments of Supplies to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia issued a statement today saying that as a result of improved distribution of UNRRA supplies within China, he has lifted the order to suspend shipments of supplies to China. LaGuardia's previous resignation will take effect on December 10. The above statement was issued two days before his resignation. This is the result of negotiations between our Executive Director Li Zhuomin and UNRRA in the medical government, and between Zheng Shinan, director of the Executive Yuan's office in Washington, and LaGuardia here. LaGuardia has established a system that stipulates that UNRRA China Mission will stipulate the amount of supplies to be shipped each month based on its estimate of China's distribution capacity. Zheng told reporters regarding this matter: It is currently estimated that our country's capacity to distribute supplies is 175,000 tons per month. When inland transportation and port facilities in our country are improved, the distribution capacity can be further increased. LaGuardia's full statement is as follows: In view of the continuous improvement in the distribution rate of special supplies in China, especially the complete clearing of accumulated materials in the ports, which is satisfactory, as reported by Mr. Eggerton, director of our China Mission, I have lifted the order to suspend shipments of supplies to China, with the exception of certain supplies that China is not yet prepared to accept. A system has now been completed that stipulates that the UNRRA China Mission will stipulate the volume of supplies to be shipped each month based on its capacity to distribute supplies in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia loudly shouted in the Economic Committee of the United Nations General Assembly today in a stern and sarcastic tone: "Peace cannot exist in a hungry world." He also invited the United Kingdom and the United States to at least accept the compromise of international relief. LaGuardia also advocated that Canada draft this compromise plan. LaGuardia said: "It is most unfortunate that the major food-donating countries in the world disagree on future relief steps. Relief work cannot succeed without consensus."</p>
<h3>Canada Proposes Special Committee to Replace UNRRA, UN Economic and Financial Committee Unanimously Approves</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 7th] Regarding Canada's proposal to establish a committee of experts next year to replace the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Economic and Financial Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened and unanimously approved it after discussion. Previously, the United States had proposed a plan for relief matters to be directly negotiated between "have" and "have-not" nations. UNRRA Director La Guardia also proposed establishing an international relief organization. Canada's plan is a compromise, stipulating the appointment of eight experts to form a committee to take over UNRRA's responsibilities in Europe from December 31st of this year and in Asia from March 31st of next year. If the plan receives final approval from the United Nations, the committee will be responsible for: (1) determining the minimum amount of food and other essential goods that needy countries must import in 1947 to prevent economic collapse; (2) determining the foreign exchange required for these countries to pay for their imports; and (3) drafting a report proposing appropriate methods to provide sufficient funds for these countries to pay for their imports. The United Kingdom and the United States, which have independently supplied 92% of UNRRA's relief materials, remain firmly opposed to joining the proposed international relief organization, as they wish to decide which countries to assist. La Guardia, on the other hand, insists that the new international relief organization should base its decisions solely on the needs of needy countries and the capacity of food-surplus countries when allocating relief supplies. The British representative to the Economic and Financial Committee, Mr. Welles, told Agence France-Presse after the meeting that the United Kingdom supports the Canadian compromise. A representative of the US delegation stated that if the committee of experts acts solely in an advisory capacity, the US government would not object. The Economic and Financial Committee is scheduled to formally vote on the Canadian proposal on the 9th, and it appears to have the full support of all member states of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>British Cruiser "Dawn" to be Transferred to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 7th] The British government will formally transfer the cruiser "Dawn," leased to China, as soon as the Chinese naval personnel training in London are ready to receive the ship. This was announced by Mr. Dugdale, Parliamentary Secretary to the British Admiralty, in response to a question in the House of Commons. He said, "Britain's decision to lease several warships to China was made in response to China's request in 1944 for Britain to lease them to assist the Chinese Navy in actively engaging in the war against Japan. Now that the war has ended, Mr. Dugdale hopes that these British warships can assist China in its naval reconstruction and consolidate the close ties between the Chinese and British navies that have lasted for over seventy years."</p>
<h3>Siberian Cold Front Reaches Tianjin and Beijing</h3>
<p>Temperature Drops to Over Ten Degrees Below Zero</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 8th] The Siberian cold front reached the northeast of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union at 2:00 PM on the 6th. It was estimated that the front edge of this cold front would reach the vicinity of Beijing by the afternoon of the 7th. Therefore, a general forecast on the 6th predicted an increase in wind force on the afternoon of the 7th (cold fronts are often accompanied by strong winds). As a result, the front edge of this cold front reached the vicinity of Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 7th, with the wind gradually strengthening and the temperature dropping simultaneously. The wind force peaked at 11:45 AM on the 8th, reaching 72 kilometers per hour. The lowest temperature was -11.6 degrees Celsius, and the highest temperature dropped to -6.4 degrees Celsius. This is the first strong wind in North China since the beginning of winter this year. The highest temperature dropping below zero degrees and the lowest temperature dropping below ten degrees below zero are both firsts for Beijing this winter. The center of this cold front was still in northern Mongolia on the afternoon of the 8th, so North China will need to endure another two or three days of cold weather. The wind force may gradually decrease on the 9th. This afternoon, the front edge of this cold front has reached eastern Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] Since last night, gale-force winds have been howling here, and the weather has become extremely cold. The wind has not stopped roaring all day today, and the cold has intensified. The Baihe River is freezing, and the temperature has dropped to -5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h3>Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou Flight Almost Caused Disaster Due to Misidentification of Direction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou flight arrived in Lanzhou on the 7th and returned to Shanghai on the 8th. The aircraft took off from Chongqing at 3:00 PM on the 6th for Lanzhou. When flying over Wushan, the pilot mistakenly identified the direction and flew towards Qinghai. Fortunately, the aircraft maintained contact with the ground and finally arrived in Xi'an at 10:00 PM that night. However, due to the excessive flight time and the imminent depletion of fuel en route from Qinghai to Shaanxi, it had to jettison its cargo, luggage, and mail to reduce the load in order to reach Xi'an. The items jettisoned included 50 sets of automobile tires, several pieces of luggage and cargo, and 14 bags of mail. This is the second time recently that Central Air Transport Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou flights have jettisoned mail, cargo, etc., due to flight obstructions, the first time being two weeks ago.</p>

<h3>Ancient Han and Jin Tombs Discovered in Zhangshu Town, Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Ancient Han and Jin tombs were recently discovered in Zhangshu Town, Jiangxi.

<h3>UNRRA Sells Various Agricultural Implements to China at Low Prices, Negotiations Began Last Week</h3>
<p>[Our City News] In order to assist in the restoration of agricultural engineering in China, UNRRA will sell various farming implements to approximately 3,000 blacksmiths in 19 provinces of China at the lowest possible prices. This plan is being discussed and implemented jointly by the Agricultural Engineering Team of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and UNRRA. These discussions were conducted in Shanghai last week by relevant personnel. The plan involves UNRRA assisting China in setting up an agricultural implement factory that can produce 20 million agricultural implements, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will manage the agricultural implement store loans so that iron shops destroyed by gunfire can resume work. Blacksmiths in cities and villages can purchase various agricultural implements at the lowest possible prices. An organization established in Yangshupu, Shanghai (near Fuxing Island), supplies 200 to 250 agricultural implements daily at extremely low prices. Similar organizations will soon be established in Zhengzhou, Henan, and Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>The Whole Story of the Shenzhen Bloodshed: British Troops Disregard Human Life and Damage Our Sovereignty</h3>
<p>— Our Guangzhou Correspondent, Liang Feng</p>
<p>This is another incident that the Hong Kong British government "deeply regrets." Before the Wang Yongxiang kicking death incident has been resolved, at around 2:00 PM on December 3rd, another bloody incident occurred at Man Kam To near Shenzhen on the border between Guangdong and Hong Kong, where British troops crossed into Chinese territory and killed our farmer Zhang Tianxiang. This is truly the most unfortunate event. Although the Chinese and British authorities have always been friendly, unfortunately, the British troops under their command have repeatedly violated the wishes of the authorities and acted recklessly. Since the victory, countless unpleasant incidents have occurred between them. This time, the British troops crossed into Chinese territory, which is already inappropriate, let alone killing someone. Damaging human life is a small matter, but damaging our national sovereignty is a big deal. If these incidents are not resolved satisfactorily, then the safety of the overseas Chinese residing in Hong Kong, who account for 98% of Hong Kong's population, will be even more difficult to guarantee in the future.</p>
<p>Blood-Stained Border Between China and Britain</p>
<p>The day after the incident, the reporter went to the scene to investigate. Villagers gathered, talking about what happened, and everyone was indignant. The place is the border between China and Britain, separated by the Shenzhen River. The south is British territory, and the north is Chinese territory (Shenzhen). A wooden bridge, the Man Kam To Bridge, spans the river. To the south of the bridgehead, there are two British military forts, which were heavily guarded at the time. A machine gun was set up on the side of the bridge, and a small armored vehicle with a machine gun mounted on it was parked there, all facing north towards Chinese territory. It was heard that the number of British troops had also increased compared to usual, and the movement of other military vehicles was more frequent, as if facing a formidable enemy. However, on the Chinese side, in addition to the police maintaining order, there was no sign of alert. The location of the incident was 39.5 meters from the north bank of the Shenzhen River, about 80 meters from the British border crossing. The body of the deceased Zhang Tianxiang was still lying on the side of the road, a desolate sight! The place was right behind the Chinese customs wooden sign next to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, which had Chinese and English words such as "Stop for Customs Inspection." The deceased was wearing a black serge short jacket and pants, yellow canvas-faced rubber shoes, white socks, and a woolen hat to the side of his head. His face was covered in blood, and the right corner of his mouth was torn because the bullet entered from the corner of his mouth and exited from his right ear.</p>
<p>Mother and Sister Painfully Recount the Deceased's Life</p>
<p>At the time, two old women were sitting around crying, who turned out to be the deceased's mother, older sister, and siblings. Later, from their mouths, they told the story of the deceased's life:</p>
<p>The deceased, Zhang Tianxiang, was 29 years old and came from Xiangxi Village near the Shenzhen River. His father, Zhang Cai, traded in fresh and salted fish. When Zhang Tianxiang was sixteen years old, his father died of overwork, and from then on, he had to shoulder the burden of the family. His family included his 55-year-old mother, his older sister A'e, his younger sister Zhang He, and a 16-year-old younger brother Zhang You, all of whom relied on him to make a living by doing small businesses. He had also studied in a private school in Shenzhen for two years when he was young, but dropped out after his father died. When the Japanese army invaded Shenzhen, the houses where people lived were burned down. He took his family and temporarily lived in a thatched hut under the Yuen Long Mountains. Because he was angered by the brutality of the Japanese army, he hid it from his mother and joined the guerrillas, spending four years in a hail of bullets, harassing the enemy until they were exhausted. He only moved back to his hometown after the victory. Who would have thought that he could safely pass through the dangerous days of the past few years, only to be sacrificed unjustly today? From today onwards, they don't know who this family of several people will rely on!</p>
<p>British Troops' Brutality is Hair-Raising</p>
<p>The events unfolded as follows: At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, two children, about thirteen or fourteen years old, carried two packages of about two pounds of white sugar (some say it was flour) from the New Territories back to Shenzhen. When they passed in front of the British military checkpoint, the British troops claimed that they were "smuggling." The children, frightened by the British soldiers, ran wildly from the Man Kam To Bridge towards Shenzhen. However, the British troops chased after them relentlessly, crossing the bridge into Chinese territory with weapons and grabbing the two children, beating them severely. When the villagers nearby saw this, they protested loudly, which led to a dispute. Because of language barriers, the misunderstanding deepened. Later, Mr. Jiang of the Chinese customs heard the news. Because he was fluent in English, he stepped forward to mediate. He learned that the British soldier's name was Lieutenant Mac Robart, the leader of the Gold Medal team of the 45th Battalion stationed on the border. When Mr. Jiang stepped forward to mediate, he was initially expelled. Later, when he was identified as a customs official, he stopped. Mr. Jiang immediately reprimanded him for not crossing the border with weapons, but the British soldier said, "The area 100 yards north of the Shenzhen River is British territory. I can not only come here at any time, but also..." At that time, more and more of our people gathered, and seeing his brutality, they were all extremely angry. The British soldier became even more angry and immediately ran back to the British barracks. After a while, gunshots were heard, and bullets flew from the British side, firing six or seven shots in a row. As a result, the villagers gathered at the bridgehead ran away in droves, and Zhang Tianxiang was unable to avoid them and fell to the ground. This unfortunate incident thus began.</p>
<p>Local Officials Lodge Protests</p>
<p>After the incident, Yuan Zhichao, the town chief of Shenzhen, Lin Wannian, the chief of police, and Lu Shen, the company commander of the 16th Regiment of the Military Police, all rushed to the scene after hearing the news and lodged protests with the British troops stationed there. However, Mac Robart vehemently denied that the person was killed by British troops, saying that the British troops had fired two shots with .303 bullets, and that it would be proof if the deceased was hit by this type of bullet. Our side replied that the bullet had already come out of the body, so how could it be identified? It would be best to gather all the British soldiers to check their guns to find out who fired the gun. Mac Robart was speechless at that time. Later, British Police Chief Ruddy and a British colonel also arrived. Our side continued to negotiate with them. The British side initially wanted to shirk responsibility, but after being identified, they admitted that "This incident is unfortunate, and we should take full responsibility. However, we should report it to our superiors and wait for their judgment." Since our side believed that they had already admitted responsibility, they could continue to negotiate and immediately returned to Chinese territory. This was the initial situation of the negotiation.</p>
<p>Public Organizations Hold Emergency Meetings</p>
<p>At that time, the local villagers, gentry, and leaders of various public organizations were all indignant after hearing about the incident. They immediately convened an emergency meeting at Shenzhen Elementary School and established the "Shenzhen All-Circles Support Association for Opposing the British Troops' Killing of Zhang Tianxiang by Crossing the Border," with thirteen local organizations serving as members of the association. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Zhenying, chairman of the association, who said, "This time, the British soldiers were unreasonable and barbaric, and they actually crossed the border with guns and killed people. Not only did our villager Zhang Tianxiang die innocently, but it was also a great insult to our national dignity. If the perpetrators are not punished, there will be no way to protect the lives and property of our people in the future. Therefore, they represent the 100,000 people of the county and vow to be their support and do their best to achieve victory." Several important resolutions were made by the association that day: (1) Request the government to negotiate with the British authorities to hand over the soldiers who committed the crime to our government for strict punishment; (2) Provide compensation to the deceased's family; (3) Urge the government to recover Kowloon and Hong Kong; and (4) Before the case is completely resolved, request the government to negotiate the withdrawal of the British troops stationed at Man Kam To from the border for five miles. That day, the association immediately sent Xu Hua (secretary of the Linchuan County Provisional Council) and Zheng Qichang (head of the Construction Section of Linchuan County) as representatives to Hong Kong overnight to report the incident to Guo Dehua, our diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi. They also came to Guangzhou on the 4th to report to the local party, government, and military authorities and the Senate, urging the authorities to take effective measures to protect the lives of the people. Currently, public organizations here have unanimously resolved to support them. Twenty-six organizations jointly issued a telegram on the 5th, calling on the National Assembly representatives to propose to the conference that the National Government actively negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau in order to safeguard territorial sovereignty. Moreover, the people of Guangdong Province are all filled with grief, indignation, and excitement.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Official Announcements Differ</p>
<p>As for the Hong Kong authorities, after the incident, the official Hong Kong announced the next day that "At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, more than a dozen plainclothes Chinese were intercepting traffic and conducting inspections at the foot of the Man Kam To Bridge in the Chinese territory of the New Territories. Armed Chinese military police stood behind them, but took no action. A soldier of the garrison on the British side crossed the bridge to inquire about the truth, but was driven back. After the soldier retreated to the British post, he accidentally pulled the trigger for some reason. A gunshot rang out, and unrest was seen on the opposite bank. Later, it was heard that someone was injured. The Chinese police officer immediately went to the British side to negotiate. The soldier was not ordered to fire. The British military authorities immediately detained the soldier after the incident and dealt with him severely." On the same day, the Hong Kong British Army Headquarters announced on the 4th that "On the 3rd, a soldier of the garrison on the border of Kowloon and the New Territories fired a .303 bullet. The investigation at the time confirmed that it was a misfire. According to a report from the Chinese authorities, the bullet killed a Chinese civilian standing on the Chinese side. The military authorities are thoroughly investigating this incident. At the same time, the British military authorities take full responsibility for the death of the deceased and express their deep regret." These two British official announcements alone already have slight discrepancies. Currently, after negotiations by Guo Dehua, our diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi, General Festing, Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong, has replied, in addition to making a verbal apology, he has proposed three guarantees: (1) Compensation for losses; (2) Severe punishment of the perpetrator; and (3) Guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future. Currently, the special envoy is carefully investigating the entire case and collecting materials to report to the Central Government before formally lodging a written protest with the Hong Kong government. (Editor's Note: Special Envoy Guo's report has been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and our official note has also been delivered to the Hong Kong side on the 7th. The news can be found in the newspaper on the 8th. In addition, there is another article by our Hong Kong special correspondent regarding this case, which will be published on page 9 tomorrow.)</p>
<p>On Special Topics</p>
<h3>Capital Education</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>This past year, we have paid close attention to education in various cities. Summarizing reports from all sides, only two words can describe it: "decline" and "chaos." The education in cities in the rear is in decline, declining beyond recognition. The education in the recovered areas is chaotic, disturbingly chaotic. We cannot help but tremble under the slogan of "Education First." Everyone knows that the nation's future rests on the next generation, and the cultivation of nation-building pillars relies entirely on education at all levels. However, in reality, it is impossible, and no one is coming forward to improve the current situation of decline and chaos.</p>
<p>Naturally, Nanjing's education cannot escape the chaos either. Everyday, children are changing schools, teachers are losing their jobs, principals are dismissed and schools cannot open, and when schools do open, district offices refuse to move out, and other such phenomena occur. However, the Nanjing Education Bureau is, after all, the education bureau of the capital. Under these circumstances, they are still trying to cultivate whatever vitality they can find; they are quickly repairing whatever sores appear. Recently, they have gritted their teeth and drafted a three-year plan, hoping to popularize national education, eliminate illiteracy throughout the city, improve the quality of education at all levels, and make reasonable arrangements for the entire education system. The other day, they invited local experts to discuss it for half a day, which is indeed a welcome sign and something worth paying attention to. This is because the education of the capital is not just the education of Nanjing, but has national implications, and its influence extends beyond Nanjing.</p>
<p>Nanjing is now the political center. We hope that Nanjing will not only be the political center but also become a center of educational expertise. This is not only for the education of the Southeast region but also to build a center for Southeast education. Beiping (Beijing) has long been known as a "cultural city" and a "student city." In addition to schools and students, it has abundant facilities such as libraries, unmatched by any other major city in the country. Before long, Nanjing should at least be comparable to Beiping. Currently, the education center of the Southeast region is still in Shanghai, but Shanghai is a commercial port and not a place for an education center.</p>
<p>Once Nanjing becomes a new education district and a new cultural city, the benefits will be numerous. Nanjing's mountains and rivers are majestic, a place where emperors built their capitals, rich in historical sites. If education is to promote patriotism and national unity, love for the rivers and mountains and recalling history are of utmost importance. Shanghai is immersed in Europeanization, with a strong mercantile atmosphere and a penchant for pleasure. If one enters a poor capital city and lives the simple lives of most compatriots, one will not be able to indulge in decadence and extravagance even if one wants to. Nanjing is where the National Government is located, the political center. Politics itself is education. Being immersed in it day and night, one can naturally become accustomed to a democratic demeanor and understand the difficulties of national policy. Moreover, Nanjing is located by the Yangtze River, with vast city walls and expansive territory, a central location, and convenient transportation. Under the circumstances of "the Southeast being a land of wealth and the Jiangzhe region being a repository of culture," there are plenty of opportunities to freely expand and build education.</p>
<p>The education of the capital is the most difficult to manage, but in reality, it is also the easiest. To realize the central position of educational undertakings cannot be borne by the local government alone, but it also cannot be managed solely by the central government. Success can only be achieved through close cooperation between the two. Large-scale educational institutions such as planetariums, aquariums, libraries, museums, art institutes, and colleges should all be managed by the central government. General social education and school education should, of course, be the responsibility of the local government. However, local tax revenue is limited. As it stands now, taking Nanjing's entire revenue to maintain the current monthly education expenditure of over 480 million yuan is already a desperate situation. How can one talk about improvement, betterment, or development? A large subsidy from the national treasury is essential. In fact, the target audience of Nanjing's education is not truly Nanjing natives. Not to mention anything else, the children of central government employees account for a large number, with origins all over the country. It is only right that the central government should contribute money. Otherwise, expecting the horse to run well without feeding it is not how things work.</p>
<p>According to the director's report: there are currently 116 national schools, 1020 classes, with approximately 61,200 students; 32 private primary schools, approximately 165 classes, with 900 students. In reality, 216 schools and 2420 classes are needed. The three-year budget requires 49,788,500,480 yuan. The city has 364,869 illiterate people, requiring 5,400 elementary adult classes and elementary women's classes, and 6,400 advanced classes. The three-year budget requires a total of 8,921,182,240 yuan. The city has approximately 50,000 children aged two to under six. Assuming one-third of them attend school, 1223 nursery classes and infant classes are needed, requiring a budget of 19,109,025,680 yuan over three years. There are eleven junior high schools with 240 classes, and nine high schools with 108 classes. The three-year budget requires a total of 15,575,924,480 yuan. In addition, adding the costs of early childhood education institutions, vocational schools, research, and administration, it is impossible to manage without over 38.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Considering the reliability and variability of the estimated figures, we feel that it is better to underestimate than to overestimate. Population, currency value, market conditions, and school fees are all problems. We are very interested in this plan because it is national in scope and has exemplary value. It is worth discussing. The plan involves more material aspects and fewer spiritual aspects. By spiritual, we mean philosophy, we mean ideals. Nanjing has its commonality, its individuality, and even more so, its uniqueness. Of course, education must be practical to avoid becoming empty talk. However, education should have a profound philosophy and far-reaching ideals that are adapted to the local conditions, so that it can guide the implementation of activities to the highest level.</p>
<p>The emphasis on creating preschools for children is truly commendable. This is where education is progressing. Before the war, out of the world's 700 million people, there were 14 million children over the age of five who did not have compulsory education laws. There were 350 million people who had laws but failed to implement them. Countries that require compulsory education for children under five include Romania and Belgium, where 66% of children aged three to six attend school, France (52%), Switzerland (50%), and Italy (30%). The United States has 500,000 kindergartens. Nursery schools only numbered twelve in 1932, but two years later, they jumped to 3,000. We do not know how many there are now. In the plan, is the distinction between infant classes and nursery classes the same as the distinction between daycares and kindergartens? Because infant schools are schools for the same age group, although the former is favored by the British and the latter is commonly used in the United States, there is no real difference. Furthermore, if classes can be changed into independent institutions, etc., then it would be the best approach. The teachers for this type of education should be specially trained in childcare, which is beyond the capabilities of general teachers.</p>
<p>The number of middle schools planned within three years is still too few. If a new education district can be created, the number of middle school students should be greatly increased. The duration of compulsory education in various countries has largely exceeded primary education and progressed to the secondary education stage. England has extended it to fifteen years old and plans to raise it to sixteen. France is fourteen years old. When the Soviet Union began its third five-year plan, it planned to popularize ten years of compulsory education in cities. Japan also changed compulsory education from six years to nine years starting in 1941. All of these circumstances provide favorable conditions for the popularization of secondary education. Opening the doors of secondary education will naturally absorb a large number of commoner children. We should focus on popularizing secondary education, keeping in mind Winston Churchill's words: "The future world belongs to the races that have received higher education. Only they can master the tools of new science."</p>
<p>Recreational parks and convalescent schools are indeed urgently needed, and they should not be limited to one type. Simple open-air schools, forest schools, summer camps, and holiday camps can all be established economically. Home economics schools are too important for women. The school's emphasis on "public health" should be changed to "various health," because prenatal care for pregnant women, hygiene for infants and children, and nutrition are more essential and practical than public health in the home. Teacher training should focus on life education and skills education, so that teaching is learning. Every primary school teacher should be able to teach physical education, conduct health education, make specimens, and repair electric lights and radios. Moral cultivation is especially indispensable in today's world where people's hearts are easily corrupted. Xunzi's "Self-Cultivation" says, "The teacher uses his body as a model of correctness and values self-stability." The "Encouragement of Learning" also says, "Therefore, power and profit cannot sway him, the masses cannot move him, and the world cannot shake him. Live according to this and die according to this." Only in this way can one be called a teacher. As for supervision, one cannot rely entirely on educational inspectors or central schools. Principals must absolutely take more responsibility. Principals should spend 70% of their time supervising. Selecting principals for the nation's children is, of course, a solemn and serious matter, but simplifying administration and allowing principals to spend less time running to the education authorities and more time in the classrooms may not be a revolutionary thing for education.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Military Control District Headquarters Telegraphic Order: Strictly Prohibit Maltreatment of Conscripted Strong Laborers; Binding and Escorting Causes Distress to the People</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] The Zhejiang Military Control District Headquarters recently telegraphed all counties and cities, stating: Recently, various townships and towns have been sending strong laborers to the county, some of whom are being bound with hemp rope, with pistols drawn, escorted before and behind, as if they were major criminals. It has been repeatedly ordered that the conscription and escort of strong laborers must be treated with respect and that binding is strictly prohibited. However, such situations still occur recently, even escalating, with individuals tied together in a string, driven under armed guard, resembling prisoners. The people are distressed. Years of conscription propaganda have been swept away. This hinders the future and is deeply abhorrent. Hereafter, if such situations occur again, once verified, the escorting personnel will be severely punished according to the law. If the supervising authorities at all levels are unaware, they will also be severely punished.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] The exemption and deferment review for Hangzhou's strong laborers was completed on the afternoon of the 4th. The Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Government has marked the names of those approved for exemption and deferment in the national militia rosters and strong laborer rosters sent by the various Bao offices. The strong laborers to be drawn by lot have been numbered and will be drawn at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th in the Municipal Government Auditorium, presided over by the Mayor and Conscription Officer.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Pinghu] Regarding this county's temporary conscription for the 34th year, the provincial order stipulates the drawing of 353 eligible strong laborers. In addition to the 120 volunteer soldiers who were successively conscripted from various townships and towns, inspected, and accepted by personnel sent by the Jiaxing National Control District, there is still a shortage of 233 strong laborers. On the 6th, the county government solemnly held a public lottery ceremony in the county government auditorium. County Magistrate Zhong personally presided over the ceremony until 10:00 p.m., when all the drawn lots were sequenced and all the numbering was completed. The official drawing was held on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chuansha] The settlement allowance for this county's conscripted strong laborers has been issued by the higher authorities, totaling 20,000 yuan per person. It is learned that the county government has sent personnel to various townships and towns to distribute the allowance by name in conjunction with the township and town heads.</p>
<h3>Winter Defense Implemented in Siming Mountain; Jiangnan Suppression Campaign Completed; Garrison Headquarters Rewards and Punishes Commanders</h3>
<p>[Yuyao] Since Commander Zheng returned to the Siming Mountain Pacification Headquarters, he has attached great importance to the suppression campaign. Chief of Military Affairs Section Zhang has personally led subordinates to search the mountains and forests several times. The banditry in the mountainous area has now been slightly suppressed. Commander Zheng, in order to prevent bandits from becoming active during the winter season, has implemented winter defense since the 1st. The troops' stationing has been further tightened, and patrols are dispatched to the mountains and forests at night.</p>
<p>[Ningbo] Siming Pacification Headquarters Commander Zheng Xiaoyin went from Liangnong to Zhiling in the rain on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. That night, he stayed at the Nanfeng Township Office. The next day, he convened a discussion meeting with the leaders of the Zhejiang Security Corps and local township and Bao heads to discuss the suppression issue in detail. Because the climate in Siming Mountain is cold and it has snowed, and transportation is quite inconvenient, the supply of staple and non-staple foods for the troops is facing difficulties. For this reason, the headquarters remains stationed in Liangnong and will not advance to Zhiling for the time being.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou] The suppression work in the Jiangnan area has now been largely completed. The Capital Garrison Headquarters has rewarded those who have contributed. Yangcheng Suppression District Commander Ma Shigong has been awarded a major merit. Parachute Corps Third Battalion Commander Guo Zhichi, Fourth Battalion Commander Liu Zheng, Ninth Company Commander Gu Weijun, Fifteenth Company Commander Yang Chunbai, Seventeenth Company Commander Zhou Yiqun, Nineteenth Company Commander Ma Xincan, Fifteenth Platoon Commander Yin Sheng, and Xicheng Joint Defense District Commander Kong Qinggui have each been awarded a merit. Pudong Joint Defense District Commander Xu Quan, Chief of Staff Chen Ang, and Headquarters Intelligence Section Chief Han Kai have been commended. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Area Suppression Commander Lü Shiyang has been reprimanded.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Lake Tai Inspection; Mao Sen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigating the Jiangwan Arsenal Explosion</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] General Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Wuxi Command Post, stayed overnight in Mu Du on the evening of the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Liu Hongde, Deputy Commander of the Lake Tai Suppression District, he sailed to Xukou by boat to inspect the terrain of Lake Tai. He originally intended to go deeper into the water area, but due to a telegram ordering him to investigate the Jiangwan Arsenal explosion, he changed his plans and returned to Suzhou at 12:00, taking a special train to Shanghai on the Qiantang.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Reduces the Number of Townships by Two-Thirds</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Pinghu] The county government is now reducing the number of townships in the county. The county government has now reduced the number of townships in the county from 53 to 19, based on six criteria: population, area, terrain, history, transportation, and wealth. The final plan is as follows: (1) The original Danghu, Yongfeng, and Qiyuan Towns are merged into Danghu Town. (2) Donghu and Shengtang Towns are merged into Donghu Town. (3) Hantang and Sifu Townships are merged into Hantang Township. (4) Nandun and Zhaogu Townships are merged into Nangu Township. (5) Qijun and Lianzhu Townships are merged into Qilian Township. (6) Zhapu, Sizhuang, and Dongqiao Towns are merged into Zhapu Town. (7) Dating, Hongshu, and Waxi Townships are merged into Wating Township. (8) Xudai, Qingxi, and Haoxu Townships are merged into Qingxi Township. (9) Huanggu, Dayan, Dushan, and Liangzhuang Townships are merged into Huanggu Town.

<h3>Chuansha Labor Service: Road Construction and Harbor Dredging</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chuansha] The county's 35th year of national labor service has begun during the slack farming season. The main tasks are the construction of the Shangchuan Highway and the dredging of the Bailong Harbor. The county government's construction technology personnel have all been dispatched to supervise, and the work is quite tense.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Songjiang Boundary Dispute</h3>
<p>Songjiang Deputy Speaker Provides Opinions</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Songjiang] A boundary dispute has occurred between Xin Zhuang and other places in this county and Shanghai. After a joint survey by two members of the Ministry of Interior and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, County Magistrate Xu, Shanghai representatives, the Songjiang Senate, and the County Party Headquarters, Deputy Speaker Zhang Huanzhi of the Provisional Senate specially provided a written opinion for the survey's reference: (1) Before the war, Xin Zhuang, Qi Bao, and part of Chang Qiao belonged to the Third District of Songjiang. The enemy and puppet regime arbitrarily changed the administrative divisions for the purpose of undermining our administrative areas and facilitating the Qingxiang campaign. Now that they have been recovered, they should be under the jurisdiction of Songjiang. (2) Although it was planned before the war that part of Da Qiao would be under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, this was originally aimed at the concessions. Now that all the concessions have been recovered, the Greater Shanghai Plan is clearly not suitable for the current needs. (3) The Greater Shanghai Plan was never implemented until 1937, which shows that it could not be implemented at that time. Now that the concessions have been recovered and Shanghai has expanded considerably, there is no need to expand further. (4) Even if the Greater Shanghai Plan is to be implemented, it should be delineated by the Ministry of Interior of the Executive Yuan. Since there is no previous document, the Executive Yuan should not arbitrarily overstep and cause disputes and difficulties in the exercise of administrative power, in accordance with the principle that the Executive Yuan should not arbitrarily overstep and cause disputes and difficulties in the exercise of administrative power.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Provisional Senate Second Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Qingpu] The county's Provisional Senate held its second meeting on the morning of the 8th to review the county's 36th year of local general budget, and to discuss and supervise the implementation of the land tax, etc. The agenda was also set for the heads of various departments to report on their work, and for various parties to question them.</p>
<h3>Xibei Town Tieshi Bridge Repaired</h3>
<p>[Nantong] The Tieshi Bridge in Xibei Town is an important passage for city-port transportation, with many vehicles passing through. However, due to years of disrepair, it was about to collapse. Now, local enthusiastic people Sun Jinzhang, Ma Qianzai, Tang Gangzhou, Lu Qian'an, Ji Guren, Sun Zubei, Huang Sanli, etc., have raised funds to rebuild it. The project was contracted to the Xintai Construction Company and has now been completed, which is convenient for all pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Status of Highways and Bridges in Jiangsu Province, North and South of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang] Since the restoration a year ago, there has been little systematic reporting on the overall situation of highways in Jiangsu Province, both north and south of the Yangtze River. The reporter, in view of the great concern of all parties on this matter, specially visited Mr. Zong Zhou, the chief of the engineering section of the Provincial Highway Bureau, and had a long talk with him for more than an hour. The status of highways and bridges in both the south and north of the Yangtze River is summarized below:</p>
<p>South of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>From Jurong to Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, and Shanghai, the matter is being handled in two stages. The bridges in the section from Jurong to Wujin are badly damaged, with more than thirty bridges in total. However, traffic can still pass through with difficulty. All bridges are planned to be rebuilt with concrete surfaces. The section from Jiangyin to Wuxi is very good. From Jurong to Zhenjiang, there are six bridges, the longest of which is more than 50 meters. Construction on two bridges, about 20 meters long, is currently underway. The other four bridges are planned to be rebuilt as permanent structures. From Zhenjiang to Wujin, there are a total of 22 bridges, totaling 210 meters. It is now planned to make 17 of the bridges permanent structures, and construction will begin soon. The other five bridges will be made of wood. From Wujin to Jiangyin, there are a total of 13 bridges, which were originally wooden bridges and have been severely damaged. Currently, it is very difficult for vehicles to pass through. Due to funding constraints, it is planned to rebuild the entire surface with wood. The section from Jiangyin to Wujin is operated by a private business, and the road maintenance work is good under the supervision of the bureau. From Wuxi to Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang, work is currently underway to actively repair the roads. Construction on five bridges from Wuxi to Shanren Bridge, with a total length of 74 meters, will begin. The repair of all bridge surfaces can be completed within the next ten days. There are two bridges between Suzhou and Kunshan, totaling 96 meters in length, and construction has now begun and can be completed in a short period of time. There are nine bridges between Kunshan and Taicang, totaling about 100 meters in length. Construction on five of the bridges has already begun. The road surface from Jurong to Zhenjiang is also being prepared for reconstruction. In the area from Jintan to Tianwangsi and Lishui, there are a total of 19 bridges, which currently need to be rebuilt from scratch. The materials have been prepared and construction will begin soon, and they will be repaired within two or three months. There are three bridges between Wujin and Caoqiao, and construction will begin soon. According to Chief of the Engineering Section Liu, Jiangsu suffered enormous damage during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. In light of Jiangsu's current economic environment, projects can only be carried out one by one. Given that Jiangsu Province has a network of rivers, the urgent needs must be considered and projects must be carried out accordingly.</p>
<p>North of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>From Pukou to Liuhe, Yizheng, Yangzhou, Taixing, Nantong, and Lvsigang, these areas originally belonged to national highways. In the past, in order to cooperate with the advancement of military vehicles, the bureau organized emergency repair teams to repair the damaged bridges and road surfaces along the way. Due to military considerations, speed was prioritized, and quality was difficult to ensure. Recently, the section from Taixing to Jingjiang and Shizhuang has not yet been opened due to the ongoing military operations. In addition, from Nantong to Rudong and Haian, from Haian to Xiannv Temple in Taixian County, and then from Taixian to the port, there are more than a dozen bridges between Taixing and Huangqiao, and construction will begin soon. There are a total of three bridges from Xiannv Temple to Shiying, and construction has now begun and can be completed in a short period of time. Finally, according to him, the highways and bridges in northern Jiangsu are still far from ideal.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Second District Commissioner's Office Organizes Land Tax Supervision and Anti-Corruption Team</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Groups to Complete Ten Tasks</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuxing] The Second District Commissioner's Office was ordered to organize a Land Tax Supervision and Anti-Corruption Team, with the Commissioner concurrently serving as the team leader. The team has four to seven supervisors, with one assigned by the Provincial Land and Food Office and the rest transferred from the Commissioner's Office. Chen Heting and Zhou Jianfei were assigned as supervisors for the Wu-Chang group; Li Yan and Shi Shoufan were assigned as supervisors for the Wu-De group; and Wu Yuyi and Lin Junmao were assigned as supervisors for the An-Xiao group.

<h3>The Subei Canal Project Will Be Completed Before the Flood Season Next Year; Three Departments Agree on Implementation Methods</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] The Subei Canal, Yi River, and Shu River dikes, as well as the repair of culverts and sluices on the east and west banks of the canal, which concern the lives and properties of tens of millions of people, have now moved from the theoretical stage to the active implementation stage. The Huai River Guidance Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Xingzheng Yuan (Executive Yuan) Suning Branch have agreed on the implementation methods. It is expected that the entire project will be completed before the flood season next year to alleviate the water troubles in Subei. The details of the methods are as follows: (1) The repair of breaches in the Subei Canal, Yi River, and Shu River dikes, and the repair of culverts and sluices on the east and west banks of the canal, will be handled by the Huai River Guidance Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Guidance Committee") after consulting with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which will entrust the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the "Engineering Bureau") to carry out the work, with the assistance of the Canal Dyke Restoration Engineering Bureau of the Huai River Guidance Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Dyke Restoration Bureau"). (2) The repair of movable dams and ship locks in the lower reaches of the Huai River, the repair of various dams along the Inner Canal leading to the sea, and the Zhongshan River dike restoration project will still be mainly handled by the Dyke Restoration Bureau, with the assistance of the Engineering Bureau.

The budget and personnel of each department will be paid and appointed by the Engineering Bureau. If there is a shortage of personnel, they may be transferred from the Dyke Restoration Bureau. (7) The survey reports, cost budgets, construction plans, project reports, and various military regulations for the projects undertaken by the Engineering Bureau shall be sent by the Engineering Bureau to the Guidance Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Suning Branch on time for review. (8) The accounting reports for the projects undertaken by the Engineering Bureau shall be sent directly by the Engineering Bureau to the Guidance Committee for verification. (9) The above projects are tentatively scheduled to be completed before the flood season of the 36th year (1947). If necessary, the completion date may be extended, but it shall not exceed the end of the 36th year. (10) These methods shall be implemented after being agreed upon by the Guidance Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Suning Branch, and after being reported to the Water Conservancy Committee for record.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Business Taxpayers Are Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Yangzhou by this newspaper] The Jiangdu County Tax Collection Office, in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, strives for fairness and rationality in the assessment of business tax for the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of this year for various businesses in the county. The assessed tax amount is determined after careful investigation based on the actual situation of each business. Therefore, businesses have been very enthusiastic in paying this tax recently.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Number of Passenger Cars on Both Railways; Freight Cars Converted into Third-Class Cars; New American-Made Cars Still Awaiting Arrival</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The two railway bureaus are using all available cars, but they are still insufficient to meet the demand. The new cars ordered from the United States will not arrive until next year. To meet the current urgent needs, the Qibiyan Locomotive Factory of the bureau is converting several freight cars into third-class passenger cars. At the same time, all damaged third-class passenger cars are being completely repaired. Once the repairs are completed, they will be used to replace the damaged passenger cars currently in service.</p>
<h3>100,000 People in Various Towns and Villages of Taixing Await Urgent Relief; Recovered Areas Are Devastated, and Compatriots Cry Out for Food and Warmth</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Taixing by this newspaper] Urgent relief for disaster victims in Huangqiao, Taixing, has been repeatedly reported by the county's Relief Association. The Subei Refugee Relief Association and the Suning Branch have allocated cash and large quantities of winter clothing and flour for investigation and distribution. Recently, with the development of pacification work, Tianxingqiao, Xiamuwei, Dajiashi, Xuanjiabao, Zhangjiaqiao, and other places under the county's jurisdiction have been successively recovered. The association sent personnel to investigate the disaster situation in various areas. According to reports, all areas are devastated, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. Many refugees lack food and clothing, numbering over 100,000. The association has repeatedly received letters from the county government and various district offices requesting assistance. Although the association is sympathetic, it lacks the resources. Therefore, it has telegraphed the Suning Branch, requesting the allocation of a large amount of relief supplies to Taixing for urgent relief to save the refugees.</p>

<h3>Fish Theft Leads to Murder in Luodian</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Luodian by this newspaper] On the night of the 6th, Gu Jinrong, Ma Amao, Jin Amao, Tao Xiaodi, and others, ten farmers from Maqiao Township, Luodian, brought fishing gear to the Bailai Alley area to steal fish from the fish ponds raised by Jin Xin, Qian Zhenting, Wang Xingsheng, and other local farmers. That night, Qian Zhenting and Wang Xingsheng were on night watch and saw someone stealing fish. They immediately stepped forward to stop them, but Wang Xingsheng was beaten. Qian was shocked and ran back to sound the gong and gather a crowd to search for the thieves. As a result, Tao Xiaodi and Wang Xingsheng both fell into the water and drowned. Except for Jin Amao, Ma Amao, and one other, who were captured, the rest escaped. The township head then sent them to the Xuhang Police Station, which transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The trial opened on the 6th. Witness Wang Xirong was subpoenaed, and all the defendants were brought to court. According to Gu Lingrong's statement, he is 35 years old, from Shishan, fishes for a living, and lives in Taojia Village, Maqiao. He went to Bailai Alley to fish that night. Because the pond had no markings, he did not know that it contained farmed fish, resulting in accidental fishing. About half an hour later, Qian Zhenting and 20-30 others came after them with hoes and carrying poles. They fled north, but Tao Xiaodi and Wang Xingsheng both drowned. According to Qian Zhenting, Wang Xingsheng was on night watch that night and was choked, and there were also injuries on his neck, indicating that he was beaten to death and pushed into the river. Judge Zhou said that the case involved murder and would be investigated further before the trial.</p>
<h3>Quzhou Cigarette Industry Collapses</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Quzhou by this newspaper] Since the widespread sale of machine-made cigarettes from Shanghai and Hangzhou, the handmade cigarette industry in the county has not only suffered poor business but also the sales prices are far out of proportion with various commodity prices. The various factories have been trying hard to maintain their operations, hoping that business in each season would improve. Since the beginning of winter, this hope has vanished. As a result, Xin'an, Dale, Quancheng, and three other companies have already closed down one after another because they could not maintain their operations. The remaining five companies, including Zhedong, are also in danger and may close at any time.</p>

However, because there are two major faults between Quanjiao and Jiangxia, the repair project requires a large amount of funds. In order to save financial resources, the Highway Bureau now plans to reroute the highway from Xujiadian in Quanjiao County, through Jieshou, Wuyi, and Xige in Chuxian, to Pukou. The project is easier and the length is the same. Construction is currently being accelerated in order to open the road as soon as possible. It is reported that after the road is opened, it will be possible to reach Nanjing from Hefei within six hours, without having to detour through Bengbu or Wuhu.</p>

<h3>Suzhou County Magistrate Replaced; Construction Departments of Six Counties, Including Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu, Changed to Bureaus; Ministry of Interior Sends Personnel to Suzhou to Inspect Police Administration</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th of this month by this newspaper] Lu Jianhua, the county magistrate of Suzhou, has been transferred to the province for other assignments as decided by the 73rd Provincial Committee meeting. Shen Chenglong, director of the Provincial Finance Department, will take over the vacancy. Shen is a qualified county magistrate from Central University and will take office in Suzhou soon. In addition, the Provincial Government has decided to expand the organization and reorganize the construction departments of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Wujin, Nantong, and Jiangdu counties into construction bureaus.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th of this month by this newspaper] In order to understand the police administration of various provinces and cities, the Police General Administration of the Ministry of Interior has dispatched officers to Taiwan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai for inspection. Commissioner Liu Guoxian, after completing his inspection tasks in Wuhu and other places, arrived in Zhenjiang a few days ago. Accompanied by He Chaoran, police administration supervisor of the Department of Civil Affairs, he went to Wuxi and other counties. He arrived in Suzhou at around 4 p.m. on the 8th and stayed at the Lexiang Hotel. He met with reporters from this newspaper and made the following remarks: China's police administration has always been characterized by each department acting on its own, without unified management, guidance, and control, which has greatly affected the progress of police efficiency. In the future, the implementation of party and government policies and the maintenance of local security will depend entirely on the police. Therefore, the police have a very important task. In order to adapt to this trend, the Ministry of Interior has decided to formulate police regulations to seek unified management and control. Therefore, it has dispatched officers to various places for inspection. The task is to examine the current police administration system in various provinces and cities, to prepare to eliminate the dross and retain the essence, learn from each other's strengths, and create an ideal and perfect new police regulation. I was dispatched to Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and have visited Hefei, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Mingguang, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, and other places. The observation results show that police funding is too low, resulting in substandard facilities. The Ministry of Interior will plan to improve this. It is learned that Liu will stay in Suzhou for about two or three days before going to Kunshan.</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate Second-Hand Landlords</h3>
<p>The city is facing a housing shortage, and the government is actively planning and the city council is working hard to explore thorough solutions. I deeply admire their concern for the people's livelihood. As I am not familiar with the law, I will discuss it based on my observations.</p>
<p>Before the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions in China, the Shanghai Municipal Council had the names of second-hand landlords and third-hand tenants because citizens of all walks of life were mixed together, with several families in one room, for the convenience of management (such as tax collection). At that time, rents were not high, and second-hand landlords did not pay attention to subletting profits, so they could maintain stability for a long time. When the city was occupied by Japanese invaders, the old practice was still followed, with the first-hand landlord serving as the head of the household, responsible for monitoring the third-hand tenants to prevent reactionaries. In addition, the number of refugees arriving in Shanghai increased daily, and rents gradually increased with the cost of living. With few houses and many people, the second-hand landlords took advantage of their power to make profits. They built attics on the upper floors, houses on the rooftops, sheds at the bottom of the alleys, and rented out the living rooms and kitchens at high rents, demanding exorbitant key money and petty rents in every possible way. However, the beneficiaries of this were the second-hand landlords, and the property owners had no right to interfere. Soon after, the enemy puppets limited the profits of the second-hand landlords to 20% of the original rent. Fearing their power, they slightly restrained themselves. Although the rent could not be completely restricted, there were few disputes because the increase was not much. However, they still demanded key money and petty rents as before. After the victory, the government knew the people's suffering and promulgated the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Regulations on December 5, 1945. Article 11, Paragraph 5 states: "If the lessee (second-hand landlord) sublets the house without making improvements and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent, the lessor (i.e., the property owner) has the right to terminate the lease." (According to me, the government believes that the profits of second-hand landlords include subsidies for housing tax, repairs, and electricity expenses, but second-hand landlords never bear these expenses. Looking at those who seek profit from their capital, even their shockingly high secret interest rates are only 15%. Second-hand landlords can get a profit of 30% without spending a penny. "30% is equal to a secret interest rate of 30%." They are still not satisfied. Even if it is reduced to 5%, it is still higher than the bank's current deposit rate.) Therefore, property owners should implement the law to relieve the suffering of third-hand tenants and open up avenues for rent increases. (If third-hand tenants are not subject to the heavy exploitation of second-hand landlords, it seems easier for property owners to increase rents.) Abandoning this path, the opportunity is manipulated by the second-hand landlords, who regard the law as a dead letter and ignore it. In my observations, there are indeed some who can adapt to the environment, not greedy for this legal profit, and share expenses equally with third-hand tenants, but they are as rare as phoenix feathers. Those who do not comply with the law and only seek profit are numerous. (They account for more than 90% and do not bear the responsibility for taxes, electricity, or repairs.) The rent charged for the sublet part exceeds 100%, 200%, or even 500 or 600 times the original rent, which is truly shocking. Therefore, property owners call for rent increases because they cannot balance their income and expenditure, and third-hand tenants seek rent reductions because they cannot afford it. Only the second-hand landlords see the incompetence of the property owners and act boldly. They collect high rents and demand huge key money, operating freely and smoothly. Those who can gain without labor in society and enjoy high profits are only the modernized second-hand landlords. However, this is also due to the loss of power by the property owners.</p>
<p>According to China's household registration law, each household is responsible for itself. The city's household registration survey and re-registration have been completed. It is no longer like the concession and enemy puppet era, which wanted second-hand landlords to be leaders and bear any responsibility. Therefore, second-hand landlords have no status in the government or the people (third-hand tenants). The housing rental dispute is not the fault of the property owner or the third-hand tenant, but is caused by the second-hand landlord's hoarding and profiteering, which obstructs it. Therefore, if the second-hand landlords are not eliminated, the housing rental dispute cannot be resolved. The power to hold the package rental right must be revoked immediately, which is not only necessary but also an essential element in reducing the living expenses of citizens. I have drafted my humble opinions in my spare time:</p>
<p>(1) Rents need to be corrected urgently. Second-hand landlords must issue rent tickets as property owners do. (Rent tickets can be divided into two types: lease and sublease. The rent ticket should indicate the road, lane, number, district, Bao-Jia household, and the monthly rent amount, as well as the name of the lessee. It should be produced and sold by the management agency.) Their profit should be limited to 5%, and the management agency should strictly stipulate penalties. The management agency should create a rent survey form and entrust the Bao-Jia to issue it to the second-hand landlords (not issued to those who do not sublet). They should be required to fill it out separately with the third-hand tenants and then have it stamped by the property owner (to check whether the amount filled in by the second-hand landlord is consistent with the amount on the property owner's rent ticket). Then, they should be sent to the Bao-Jia to be forwarded to the management agency for review. (This form should be filled out once and then refilled within 10 days after each rent adjustment.) If their profits exceed the regulations, the competent agency should immediately notify the property owner to terminate their lease right and manage it directly, but they should still be allowed to rent. In addition to returning the rent collected in excess, they should also be punished according to the amount of the excess. Third-hand tenants who falsely report should also be punished.</p>
<p>(2) Private key money should be strictly prohibited. According to the report on August 10, 1946, "Article 4 of the two housing rental regulations states that 'The lessor shall not collect key money or petty rent in any name other than rent. If violated, the committee may order the lessor to return the illegal fees after verification, and may also impose a fine on the lessor.'" In terms of both reason and law, the lessor should be punished. (The lessor mentioned in the regulations may include both property owners and second-hand landlords.) However, there are very few old empty houses in the city. Property owners only collect key money for new houses, which is rare, and the government is encouraging construction because of the housing shortage, so this is another issue. Generally, those who sublet are second-hand landlords (i.e., lessees). The key money is all in gold bars and cash. How can it be verified? Moreover, after the sublessor leaves, they disappear without a trace. Whom can you pursue? Therefore, the penalty must focus on the sublessee or be jointly punished with the sublessor. If the sublessor cannot be summoned, the sublessee should be ordered to track them down within a time limit. If they fail to track them down within the time limit, the sublessee should be jointly and severally liable. However, if the property owner or agent receives a transfer fee and does not report it, then even if there are regulations, they are useless. Therefore, the way to stop it is not in penalties, but in notarization.</p>
<p>Anyone, whether a second-hand landlord or a third-hand tenant, who wants to move out of the house with their family, must apply for a move-out 15 days in advance and send a letter reporting the confirmed date of the move-out to the Bao-Jia, and the Bao-Jia shall notify the property owner or second-hand landlord to cancel the lease at the relevant office. (If it is a second-hand landlord moving out, the property owner will directly manage it.) At the same time, the property owner or second-hand landlord should announce the vacancy in advance (stating the number of empty rooms, area, deposit, rent amount, address, and location of the relevant Bao-Jia office). If there are people who want to rent, they can first find a guarantor (i.e., a rent guarantor) and register together at the relevant Bao-Tian office (the rental right will be given to the first registered person). Handle the lease (the lease and housing registration book should be produced and sold by the management agency and announced within a time limit. Private leases are invalid after the time limit). Go to the property owner or second-hand landlord to pay the fee and complete the lease procedures. And they must apply for moving in according to the Bao-Tian regulations before they can move in. (According to me, the sale of farmland and houses in the countryside is notarized by the Bao-Jia, and a corresponding handling fee is charged. Although the Bao-Jia system in the city has been completed, more than half of them are unable to proceed due to economic difficulties. Now, why not imitate it to enrich the Bao-Jia funds.) And if the staff who handle housing rentals privately solicit money, they will be investigated according to the law after verification. (According to me, since the vacancy is announced, the renter will naturally be unwilling to spend extra money. The staff who handle rentals will also not be able to force them to pay fees. With heavy supervision, even if you want to bribe, I am afraid that no one will accept it.)</p>
<p>(3) Management should be simple. If the property owner directly manages it and finds it troublesome to make too many rent tickets and collect rent, then in addition to the deposit and guarantor, tenants can be required to use a chain guarantee method, monthly rotating representatives to collect rent and pay it to the property owner themselves. If the house is vacant, they are also responsible for helping to find tenants. If self-payment is not appropriate, or if someone is hired to handle it, a material fee and a handling fee for rent collection can be added. I think that since the tenants are exempt from the heavy exploitation of the second-hand landlords, there is no reason why they would not agree. And when the housing shortage is solved in the future, there will be no second-hand landlord obstacles. It will never happen that the whole house is empty, which is also beneficial to the property owner. (Zhi Dao)</p>

<h3>Lewis Considers the Overall National Interest; US Coal Miners' Strike Ends; Preparing to Negotiate New Contract with Government and Mine Owners; Truman Temporarily Cancels Broadcast</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] United Mine Workers President Lewis today suddenly ended the bituminous coal miners' strike, yielding to the actions the Supreme Court and the President were about to take. Lewis has notified 400,000 miners to immediately return to work in accordance with the wages and other conditions stipulated in the government contract, and has requested negotiations for a new contract. The 17-day-long strike, once it ends, will give the precarious US economy a chance to breathe. Lewis hastily summoned reporters, and in his usual dramatic style, read the notice to the miners, announcing the immediate resumption of work, for a period of at least until March of next year. Lewis stated beforehand that he would personally read the notice to the miners, so that all reporters would know that "This is entirely of my own volition today, out of good faith. As for the motivation, it is purely speculation. Some philosophers have said that pursuing motivation is the most elusive thing in the world."</p>
<p>However, two facts are quite obvious: (1) Truman's broadcast address seemed to bypass Lewis and appeal directly to the miners, and at the same time, news was spreading that some mining industries had already resumed work. (2) Lewis's contempt of court case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, and if the Supreme Court upholds the original verdict, the Mine Workers Union will continue to be in contempt of court, with the possibility of heavier penalties. Three hours before Lewis announced the cancellation of the strike, lawyers from both the government and the union secretly met with Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Since the US coal mine strike began, New York City and 21 states across the country have implemented electricity conservation measures, reducing lighting, and the entire country was plunged into a dim scene. After Mine Workers Union President Lewis announced the end of the strike this afternoon, nationwide lighting restrictions were lifted. The Mayor of New York announced that Broadway Avenue could once again be brightly lit, and the Civilian Production Administration also ordered the governors of 21 states to immediately cancel the lighting restrictions. At the same time, restrictions on railway freight and passenger transport have been lifted, and coal export orders can also be cancelled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] President Truman had originally scheduled a broadcast address for the 8th to directly call on the miners to return to work, but since the strike suddenly ended this afternoon, the President's speech was temporarily cancelled. This morning, the White House spokesman still said that the President was busy preparing for his speech and had no time to see guests.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] It is particularly coincidental that Lewis ended the strike on the fifth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. The news of the end of the strike was announced at 2:00 PM, and the news of the Pearl Harbor attack also began to spread at 2:00 PM on December 7, 1941. Lewis announced that the reason for taking this action was to allow the Supreme Court to freely deliberate, free from the influence of public pressure caused by the economic crisis. Lewis requested to negotiate a new contract with the government or mine owners in accordance with the Supreme Court's ruling.</p>
<p>Europe is Greatly Excited</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 7th] The news of the end of the US coal mine strike has greatly excited Europe. The impact of the strike was such that it brought US exports of food, fuel, and machinery to Europe to a standstill. The UK has warned of reduced food rations, and most people in Germany are in a state of semi-starvation, fearing further reductions in rations.</p>
<h3>German Question Begins Discussion; US and Soviet Union Each Offer Proposals; Appointing Dedicated Representatives to Listen to the Views of Other Countries; Opinions on Limiting Occupation Troop Levels Remain Divided</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] The Four Foreign Ministers today discussed two major issues related to the German question, namely, appointing dedicated representatives to deliberate on the German question between this Foreign Ministers Conference and the next, and to listen to the opinions of other countries. Each Foreign Minister offered opinions on how to discuss the German question. Molotov and the other three Foreign Ministers disagreed on whether to establish a dedicated representatives committee immediately to listen to opinions, or to wait until after the next Foreign Ministers Conference is held. Byrnes and Bevin both believed that smaller countries were dissatisfied because they were only allowed to express their views after the Foreign Ministers Conference had established basic resolutions when discussing treaties with German vassal states. Therefore, if Molotov's suggestion is accepted this time, allowing dedicated representatives to listen to the views of other countries only after obtaining instructions from the Foreign Ministers Conference, it would inevitably invite the same dissatisfaction from other countries. Foreign Minister Bevin had to leave early to go to Washington, so today's talks did not reach an agreement on the issue of appointing a dedicated representatives committee and will continue to be discussed on Monday.</p>
<p>US Suggestions</p>
<p>Byrnes's proposed recommendation for the next Foreign Ministers Conference is as follows: (1) The Foreign Ministers Conference should appoint dedicated representatives to deliberate on the German question. (2) Before the dedicated representatives establish any resolutions at the Foreign Ministers Conference, they should listen to the views of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Luxembourg, and other countries willing to express their views, as a preliminary statement before the Foreign Ministers Conference formally consults with the countries. (3) The Berlin Allied Control Council should submit reports to the Foreign Ministers Conference on the following points: (A) The form and scope of the German interim government, (B) Various issues related to the future political economy of Germany under the Allied Control Council. (4) Treaty with Austria. (5) Limiting the number of occupation troops stationed in Europe. (6) The timing and location of the next conference. The agenda for the next conference should include: (A) The future borders of Germany, including the disposition of the Saar region, (B) The continued disarmament of Germany. The United States suggests using treaties and other necessary measures to regulate Germany's future economic and military control, (C) Establishing central institutions, (D) The German interim government, (E) An overview of the Treaty with Germany, (F) Treaty with Austria, (G) Limiting the number of occupation troops, (H) Other agreed-upon matters.</p>
<p>Soviet Suggestions</p>
<p>Molotov's proposed recommendations are as follows: (1) The next Foreign Ministers Conference should discuss the Treaty with Germany and Austria (he did not indicate a date but suggested during the discussion that it be held in Moscow in the second half of February). (2) The agenda for the conference should be: (A) The Berlin Allied Control Council's report on the work done since the Potsdam Conference on disarmament, implementation of democratic and economic principles, and reparations, etc. (B) The central administrative institutions of Germany and issues related to the future German government. (C) The preparation of the German Peace Treaty, discussion procedures, appointment of dedicated representatives, and the basic instructions issued by the Foreign Ministers Conference to the representatives. (D) The preparation of the Treaty with Austria. (E) The liquidation of Prussia, with a report submitted by the Allied Control Council. (F) The report of the Coal Mine Experts Committee. (G) Please ask the Allied Control Council to submit reports on all items on the agenda two weeks before the next Foreign Ministers Conference is convened.</p>
<p>During the discussion, Byrnes expressed his willingness to agree to include the Coal Mine Experts Report and the liquidation of Prussia on the agenda. The US and Soviet drafts are largely the same, with the only exception being the issue of limiting occupation troops. Byrnes's recommendation on limiting the number of occupation troops in Europe stated that, in order to facilitate the restoration of peace in Europe, the allied forces stationed in Europe should have numerical limitations after the treaties with German vassal states are signed. Byrnes advocated that, starting from April 1 of next year, the maximum number of troops stationed in Europe should be as follows: In Germany, the US military should not exceed 140,000, the British military 140,000, the French military 70,000, and the Soviet military 200,000. In Austria, the US, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France should each not exceed 20,000. The Soviet Union may also station 20,000 in Poland, 5,000 in Hungary, and 5,000 in Romania.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bern, Switzerland, 7th] The Director of Information of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Grosz, stated here that the Polish government will soon submit its views on the German question to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Committee Encounters Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Crux Remains the Veto Power</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 7th] The disarmament committee has been stalled today due to the issue of the independence of the arms control agency. Soviet representative Vyshinsky insisted that the two control agencies should operate directly under the Security Council and be subject to the veto power provisions. US representative Connally insisted that the control agencies should be independent. The Soviet Union had originally agreed not to use the veto power within the control agencies, but insisted that the veto power should apply when any event is considered by the Security Council. After four hours of debate on this issue, it was referred to the drafting committee for review, and a report will be submitted on the 9th.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Debates India's Complaint; Lengthy Duration Exceeds Expectations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's discussion on Saturday of India's complaint against South Africa's mistreatment of Indian nationals lasted longer than expected and has not yet reached a conclusion, causing Britain's attempt to seek General Assembly approval for international inspection to investigate whether military reports from various countries are accurate to be postponed until Sunday for discussion. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only arrived at Flushing Meadow to attend the General Assembly in the evening with his three main aides, at which time the British side had already announced its new move to propose the above-mentioned proposal. India's complaint is expected to have a long debate, and Molotov proposed a resolution stating that this complaint cannot be debated to the end at the Saturday night's General Assembly.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 8th Radio Broadcast: US Representative Connally solemnly declared today at a meeting of the Political Committee that the United States will never sever diplomatic relations with Franco under any circumstances, nor will it support economic sanctions against Spain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 7th] The subcommittee of the Political Committee of the General Assembly has passed the US-amended proposal, urging the United Nations General Assembly to recommend that the Franco government not participate in institutions established by or related to United Nations agencies, and not allow the government to participate in meetings or other activities of United Nations agencies or their affiliated institutions, until a new government acceptable to Spain is established.</p>

<h3>Tito Asks Britain Not to Accommodate King Peter</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Well-informed political sources have recently stated that Yugoslav Premier Marshal Tito has already requested the British government to refuse King Peter of South's right to reside in British territory. The Yugoslav court will declare King Peter a war criminal, and it is widely believed that Marshal Tito has also made the same request to France and Switzerland, but monarchists of South have not been able to confirm these rumors. Diplomats believe that when the British government replies to Marshal Tito, it will explain that political refugees from various countries traditionally have the right to reside in the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>China Proposes to the General Assembly to Permanently Ban Japan from Manufacturing Poisons; Establishing an International Drug Control Agency in the Far East</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 7th] The Narcotics Committee established by the United Nations Economic and Social Council met today to discuss ways to permanently ban Japan from manufacturing poisons to prevent it from poisoning the people of the East again. Chinese Representative Dr. Xie proposed establishing an international narcotics warehouse in the Far East, under the control of the United Nations, but allowing the manufacture and distribution of narcotics. If Japan wants to import narcotics, it must go through this warehouse, and this point must be included in the future peace treaty with Japan. The Egyptian representative proposed a supplementary proposal, advocating the establishment of another warehouse in other locations, especially the Near East. The US representative also proposed establishing an international agency, with a special charter drafted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The Dutch representative expressed his opinion, opposing the above-mentioned plans, advocating only setting up a United Nations supervisory office on Japanese territory to supervise the import of narcotics. Countries producing narcotics can transport narcotics into Japan if they obtain a license from the supervisory office. The Chinese representative agreed with the opinions of Egypt and the United States, but did not agree with the proposal of the Netherlands, believing that it was not enough to effectively resist the scourge of drugs.</p>
<h3>London Round Table Conference Fails; British Troops Do Not Intend to Withdraw from India</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] After the Anglo-Indian-Muslim Round Table Conference was declared a failure, it was recently reported by British military sources that unless India has sufficient troops to protect its borders and prevent any aggression, the British troops cannot withdraw from India. British troops must be able to land in India in an emergency, without waiting for the results of negotiations between the British and Indian governments. British political sources said that the British troops will not withdraw from India until the National Assembly has been convened to protect the rights of all elements of all ethnic groups in India. Britain sincerely hopes that India and the Muslim community can reach an agreement, but the rights of other minorities should be protected once the British troops withdraw. The Conservative Party will submit this issue to the House of Commons for discussion. As for the issue of Indian Christians, it is bound to receive even more attention, because the Archbishop of York (one of the highest authorities in the Church of England) has protested that the time is not yet ripe for British troops to withdraw from India. The House of Commons is now scheduled to discuss the Indian issue next week, possibly on the 21st of this month.</p>

As for the policy adopted by the British government, it is to assist Greece in controlling the entire country without the intervention of British troops.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 7th] Deputy Prime Minister Gonatas said that the British military authorities on the Dodecanese Islands have begun to transfer the administration of the islands to Greek officials. Greece has not yet sent police to take over the actual reception until after the Treaty with Italy is signed.

The "Sunday Chronicle" inquired by telephone to the Soviet Embassy last night, requesting confirmation or denial of the rumor of the death of the Soviet leader.

<h3>Fifteen-Story Building Filled with the Smell of Burning Flesh, American Hotel Fire, Over 100 People Buried in the Flames</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Atlanta, Georgia, 7th] A fire broke out in the 15-story Winecoff Hotel on Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta before dawn this morning. At least 120 of the 285 guests were buried in the flames. Men, women, and children screamed in terror, or were burned to death, or fell to their deaths, or died of suffocation. At least 100 people were injured. The fire started on the third or fourth floor and quickly spread upward via the escalators and elevators, trapping the guests on the upper floors in the flames. Most people stood on the balconies, unable to be rescued in time, and jumped down at risk. Some fell into the nets held by the fire department, but the nets were released due to the excessive force of the fall from a high place. Some residents closed their doors tightly to prevent smoke and fire from entering, and were spared from the disaster. Others used sheets to tie ropes and descended along the windows. A woman jumped from the balcony on the sixth floor, fell into a black alley and died. After the fire was extinguished, a visit inside revealed that the bodies above the third floor were scattered everywhere, the beds and furniture were burned, and the air was filled with the strong smell of burning flesh.</p>
<h3>International News Briefs</h3>

<h3>Eisenhower Straightforwardly Denies Atomic Bombs Leaving the Country, Future War is "Super Blitzkrieg"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] When Chief of Staff of the Army Eisenhower met with the press today, someone asked whether the recent statement by US representative to the UN Connally that Britain and Canada knew the secrets of the atomic bomb was true. After hesitating for a long time, Eisenhower replied that the United States had never transported atomic bombs or their materials to the United Kingdom or other countries. However, Eisenhower did not comment on whether Britain and Canada could build atomic bombs themselves. Eisenhower outlined the terror that a new war would bring to the world, saying that armed conflicts in the coming years would be a large-scale struggle for long-distance controlled weapons, which could destroy industrial centers in an instant. Before reaching this "super blitzkrieg era," it is the duty of the General Staff to prepare for any eventuality. The US General Staff has established special departments, headed by scientists, and all plans are conceived by them. If the United Nations does not eliminate the terror of this kind of hellish war, then all countries will have to evacuate and cover up all their industrial centers to avoid being destroyed by a single blow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] American reporter Pearson reiterated today that some atomic bombs have indeed been transported to storage in northern Britain, but Britain does not have detonators, so they cannot be detonated. As for not transporting detonators to the UK, it may be to avoid the danger during air transport, or there may be other reasons.</p>

<h3>Explosions Continue at Jiangwan, Part of Stadium Collapses, Half of Entire Depot Destroyed, Losses Difficult to Estimate, Ten Transportation Soldiers Killed, Injured, or Missing, Commander Fu Reports to the Ministry of National Defense, Various Agencies Confer on Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The No. 1 Branch of the No. 2 Ordnance Depot of the Jiangwan Logistics Command Headquarters has been experiencing loud explosions day and night since the afternoon of the incident. Yesterday morning, the explosions could still be clearly heard in the city. Fu Wen, commander of the First Supply Zone, along with Deputy Chief of Staff Mao, went to the scene of the accident again at 9:30 a.m. yesterday to inspect. Mayor Wu Guobai and Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Wu also arrived for inspection one after another. Firefighters worked hard to rescue the situation. The explosions gradually subsided by the afternoon, as most of the shells in the depot had been detonated after a week of explosions. Only a small portion remained at the bottom layer, buried under bricks, wood, and miscellaneous items. When the temperature increased to a certain level, explosions continued intermittently. Firefighters, to avoid danger, dared not approach to clear the area. They could only use fire trucks to continuously pump water into the area to reduce the temperature and prevent the remaining ammunition from exploding due to heat.</p>
<h3>Patrol Around the Wall, Every Step a Fright</h3>
<p>A reporter drove to the scene of the accident again at 2 p.m. yesterday to inspect. The weather was clear, the winter sun was warm, and everything near the warehouse had returned to normal. The cordon had also been completely removed. Except for the shattered glass windows, no serious damage was seen to the surrounding civilian houses. The barracks of the Second Air Force Squadron were a few dozen steps away from the explosion site. The roof was pierced by shrapnel in two places, and all the glass windows in the room were shattered. Many shrapnel also landed on the hygiene squadron of the Logistics Department on Guohua Road.</p>
<p>The warehouse</p>
<p>The location of the warehouse is the former municipal stadium, which is an oval building. The destroyed part is about half of the entire depot, which is the semi-circular building from the south entrance of Humin Road to the east gate of Guohua Road Stadium. It is reported that a huge amount of ammunition is still stored in the northern part of the depot. Fortunately, the wind was blowing southwest when the explosion started the day before yesterday, so it did not spread, which was a great stroke of luck. The main entrance of the destroyed area has become ruins and broken walls, which is extremely desolate. The surrounding wall on the right has collapsed, and the stands have also been broken and separated. There is a wire mesh barrier in front of the gate. From a distance, white smoke can still be seen rising from the rubble. Suddenly, another loud bang was heard, and another shell exploded. The reporter patrolled around the wall and heard two more explosions. However, the explosive force was not great, there was no fire, only thick smoke was seen. The reporter then found several pieces of shrapnel on the ground nearby, one of which was engraved with the words "Showa 15th Year" (1940).</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Escaped Wounded Soldiers, Strictly Investigated</h3>
<p>The cause of the explosion, according to soldiers near the warehouse where the accident occurred, was that during the transportation of grenades, a warehouse soldier shouted "Dinner is ready!" at noon. The porters, hearing the call for dinner, were absent-minded and arbitrarily dumped the entire box of grenades they were carrying, which collided with the ground and caused a major disaster. As for the rumors that there were other complicated reasons for the explosion and that suspects had been captured, they could not be confirmed. The reporter repeatedly inquired from the Logistics Command Headquarters, which still stated that it was caused by the explosion of grenades. The more than ten warehouse soldiers who escaped at the time were personally interrogated by the commander of the First Supply Zone yesterday afternoon, and the interrogation was still continuing late into the night.</p>
<p>Mao Sen Ordered to Come to Shanghai to Investigate</p>
<p>The sound of the explosion could still be heard from time to time until 1 a.m. this morning. The military and police agencies in the city are currently discussing the aftermath. Commander Fu of the Supply Zone is continuing to investigate the truth of the incident and has reported the details to the Ministry of National Defense for instructions. It is reported that the Capital Garrison Command has sent Director Mao Sen to Shanghai last night to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>It Will Not Be Possible to Enter for Five or Six Days</p>
<p>It is still impossible to estimate how much military ordnance has been destroyed in this incident. It will take at least five or six days before it can be entered, as there are fears that there may still be some unexploded bombs.</p>
<h3>Depot Chief Missing, His Wife Cries to Everyone</h3>
<p>The number of casualties in the Jiangwan explosion case is rumored to be more than 130 warehouse soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown. According to reporters' confirmation from the Logistics Command Headquarters, this is inaccurate. It is said that there is a company of warehouse soldiers stationed in the depot, but because there is not enough dormitory space in the depot, some soldiers are billeted in another barracks a considerable distance from the explosion site. The incident occurred at noon, and two platoons of soldiers were already eating in the barracks at that time. Therefore, there was only one platoon of soldiers near the explosion site, and most of them had escaped because the shells exploded gradually. It has now been confirmed that one transportation soldier was killed, four were injured, and five were missing. In addition, several porters must have died. There were also several soldiers from nearby troops who were injured during the rescue or by stray bullets. As for the depot chief, Wang Renshan, his whereabouts are still unknown. It is feared that it will not be possible to determine whether he has been buried in the bomb crater until the explosion site has been cleared. However, his wife cried next to the stadium yesterday, saying that her husband must have died.</p>

<h3>Huddling in the Northwest Wind: A Stray Child is Rescued - The Relief Center for Child Refugees and the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Child Welfare Division Rescue Over 200 During Shanghai's First Cold Snap</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] As the first cold snap hit Shanghai, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Relief Center for Child Refugees, and the head of the Child Welfare Division of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Shanghai branch, drove a large truck out into the desolate streets and alleys after midnight to collect stray children huddling in the northwest wind.</p>
<p>Under bridges, at the foot of walls, beside cars, in alleyways, in garbage cans... these were their shelters. Wrapped in a straw mat, they struggled against the bitter wind all night! Unable to endure it, they would simply die silently, and no one would know.</p>
<p>Over five nights, people rescued more than two hundred children (not including those found already lifeless and sent to the Pushan Villa). These many unfortunate children, upon hearing that they could find shelter from the wind and rain in the Relief Center, knelt and repeatedly kowtowed in gratitude.</p>
<p>Most of the children were barely alive when they were brought to the Relief Center. They had to be completely doused with hot water to gradually revive. Then, they were given something to eat, a bath, their hair was shaved, and they were dressed in the center's uniform. Immediately, they became tidy, clean, energetic, smiling children!</p>
<p>A month ago, when the child refugees who had been trained at the center paraded and presented a flag to the city government, Mayor Wu repeatedly said to them with tears in his eyes: "The nation has failed you! The nation has failed you!" After Mrs. Cripps visited the Relief Center, she was deeply moved and immediately promised to raise funds in England for a school and a factory for them!</p>
<p>What should we do? The number of over two hundred is truly too small. When the second cold snap hits Shanghai, how many innocent children will freeze to death on the streets! (The picture shows many stray children after being rescued.)</p>
<h3>Bao Huaguo Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business to Discuss Industrial and Mining Inspection Work</h3>
<p>Bao Huaguo, Director of the Industrial and Mining Inspection Department of the Accounting and Statistics Department, arrived in Shanghai on official business. This reporter specifically inquired about the situation of the Shanghai branch. I was told that the Shanghai branch has already been preparing an office location, which has been fixed at 308 Wuchang Road, and will actively promote the work after the funding is approved. When asked how the future inspectors will be trained, it was said that the training of inspectors is also in the plan. It is intended to recruit graduates from civil engineering or mechanical engineering and other departments of universities at home and abroad after the funding is approved, and train them to take on this task. The reporter also asked what impact the implementation of industrial and mining inspections would have on industry. It was said that industrial and mining inspections are active and are pre-emptive work, not passive preventive work. This work is still in its infancy in our country, and all countries in Europe and the United States have this system.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Overseas Chinese Treatment after the Tanjong Malim Incident</h3>
<p>Chen Derong, consultant to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently returned to Shanghai from Kuala Lumpur. According to reports, since the Tanjong Malim massacre, the British side has improved the treatment of local overseas Chinese. In addition, the Communist Party had organized the so-called "Kuala Lumpur Communist Party Central Local Committee" in the area and carried out extensive activities. It is reported that the British side has expressed strong opposition to this name and has recently changed it to the "Office" organization, but the British side is still paying close attention to its various activities.</p>
<h3>Gunfire on Zhongzheng East Road: Police Fight with Bandits in Huangpu District - Gang of Thieves Rob Cotton Weaving Factory at Gunpoint - Employee Returning Home Suspects Something and Reports to Police, Who Surround the Factory - Stolen Goods Recovered, Three Thieves Escape, Two Thieves Captured</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At about 6:50 p.m. yesterday, five thieves broke into the Xinsheng Cotton Weaving Factory at 312 Zhongzheng East Road through the back door. One was carrying a grenade, one had a semi-automatic weapon, and one held a pistol. Two of them were guarding the back door, while the other three broke into the accounting room, threatening with guns. They first snatched a gold ring from the accountant's hand, and then found 1.2 million legal currency on the accounting table, which they placed in a travel bag and handed to a lookout thief. As the other thieves were preparing to go upstairs to loot other items, an employee of the factory returned from outside. As soon as he reached the alley at the back door, he saw two people lingering near the door. Realizing that they were not good people, he went out and reported to the Huangpu Branch across the street. After receiving the report, Deputy Chief Du Wang personally led the section chief Li Yinmin and all the plainclothes police officers to rush to surround the area, arresting the two thieves guarding the back door and recovering the stolen goods. The three thieves in the house heard the police arriving and climbed onto the roof. Fearing that the police would follow and arrest them, they fired fifteen shots first. The police also returned five shots. After a standoff of about ten minutes, the three thieves fled west. The thieves crossed the roofs to the sun deck on the upper floor of 32 Detai &amp; Co., and when they climbed onto the stove room, they were detained by the old steward Zhang Rijin. Who knew that the thief was extremely cunning and falsely claimed to be a police officer arresting thieves. Zhang saw that his clothes were neat and tidy and believed him to be true, so he released him. The thief then left calmly. The two thieves who were arrested were taken to the police station for interrogation. According to their confessions, they were Zhang Shaochuan and Yuan Rong. Zhang had previously robbed the Freedom Army three times and had been detained in the branch, with a record on file. The police are currently tracking down the three accomplices who escaped.</p>
<h3>Five U.S. Congressmen Left Shanghai Yesterday - They Greatly Praised "Meng Meinu" After Watching It</h3>
<p>Isaac, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, and House Representatives Herley and Mansfield, arrived in Shanghai from Beiping on the afternoon of the 6th to inspect U.S. military cemeteries in the Pacific. Yesterday morning, they left Shanghai to go to Iwo Jima. The night before their departure, Mayor Wu and Admiral Kirk accompanied them to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the musical drama "Meng Jiangnu." The stage and audience were extremely excited, and the performance that night was particularly brilliant. The five Congressmen praised it highly. It is reported that Huang Renlin, the director of the Lizi Society, said that Meng Jiangnu intended to perform in the United States, and they unanimously expressed their welcome. At the end of the entire play, the five Congressmen and Admiral Kirk, Mayor Wu, and others happily left.</p>
<h3>Relief Supplies Transported to Communist-Controlled Areas - Wanmin Ship Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Shiliang, director of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Yantai Office, returned to Shanghai from Yantai in late last month to plan the third shipment of relief supplies to Yantai. Yesterday morning, the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's transport ship Wanmin left Shanghai for Yantai, carrying 1,500 tons of supplies to be used for relief in the Communist-controlled areas. The fourth shipment of supplies will also be carried out within this week.</p>
<h3>Conversion of Pedicabs to Three-Wheelers - Extension Granted for Uncompleted Conversions</h3>
<p>Five Items Approved by the City Government</p>
<p>The city's Pedicab Business Association previously petitioned the city government because the conversion of pedicabs to single-seat three-wheelers that were eliminated this year was rushed and the frame sizes did not meet the regulations. It is now known that the city government has responded to the five requests previously made by the industry one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the request for an extension of the revocation of the licenses of the eliminated pedicabs due to insufficient materials and equipment for the conversion of vehicles, out of consideration for compassion, an appropriate extension will be granted if the assembly has already started but is not completed. This does not mean that an extension is granted to all converted vehicles in general. (2) The center point of the three-wheeler must still use a double center. The government will not allow any flexibility in this regard for the sake of driving safety. (3) The 64-inch maximum length of the frame center refers to the already-made frame. The existing frames that exceed 60 inches but do not exceed 64 inches will be allowed if they have been verified by the Public Works Bureau. Those that have not been made must be manufactured according to the specified dimensions. If there are indeed difficulties, the manufacturers can always contact the Public Works Bureau for consultation. (4) Regarding the guarantee that no new vehicle licenses will be issued, the city's Public Works Bureau had already issued a notice on July 5 to stop the registration of new three-wheelers, so there is no need to discuss it. (5) Regarding the crackdown on unlicensed vehicles, it is the police局's regular job to investigate and deal with unlicensed vehicles, and the局has already been cracking down on them at any time.</p>
<h3>Repair Damaged Roads - Increase Traffic Routes - Active Planning - Prosperity in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Regarding the prosperity of Nanshi and the restoration of the pre-war city appearance, the Public Utilities Bureau and the Public Works Bureau have discussed and formulated detailed measures. It is reported that in addition to the Public Works Bureau actively repairing the damaged roads in Nanshi, the Public Utilities Bureau will increase traffic routes, transportation, and street lights in Nanshi. At present, there are few buses on Zhonghua Road and the Republic of China Road Ring Road, and passengers are extremely crowded. The bureau is now planning to increase the number of vehicles, which will be implemented after the vehicles of the Materials Supply Bureau arrive. Secondly, the section from Jiangbian Brick Guji Ferry to Nanyang Bridge, passing through the bustling areas of Xiejiao Tangjia Fuxing East Road, etc., will be added to the bus service. Recently, the Outer Nanshi Road is being repaired by the Public Works Bureau, and once it is repaired, the Public Utilities Bureau also intends to purchase more buses to run on the route. It is currently planned to start from the Dongchang Road Ferry Terminal, go south through Nanmatou, pass Guohuo Road, turn north through Chezhan Road, and enter Zhonghua Road to Nanyang Bridge. In addition, it is planned to install street lights in all streets of Nanshi to restore the pre-war situation.</p>
<h3>Civil Servants Unable to Make Winter Clothes - Most Clothing Stores are in a Slump</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Not long after winter began, there have already been two cold snaps in Shanghai. According to the observatory's forecast, there will be a third cold snap in the next few days, and this one will last longer than the previous two. This news feels like an unspeakable threat to people who don't have winter clothes, and they are worrying about how to get through these cold days. Most small civil servants are locked in their offices all day, and in addition to planning how to eat a bowl of rice a day, they also have to arrange a few winter clothes for their families to keep out the cold. Looking at the published cost-of-living index, clothing is still at the top. It costs more than 200,000 yuan to make even the most ordinary woolen coat. Some people think they can buy a used piece of clothing at a second-hand store or buy an American ready-made item at a joint market and alter it. However, the labor is too expensive, and the labor cost of altering a used piece of clothing is more than the price of the original clothing, so people scold the owners of clothing stores in private.</p>
<p>But the owners of clothing stores complain a lot, saying that it is already very difficult to keep a store open, especially in this sluggish year. The money they earn includes endless hardships and tears. This year's business is more sluggish than before the war. The cost of domestic raw materials is high and the quality is poor, there are few sources of foreign goods, and the wages of tailors increase at any time. In addition to what the boss should earn, they also have to bear the cost of food and salaries for the employees and all necessary operating expenses, so many clothing stores have already dismissed half of their staff, feeling that they have no business to do after eating. There are also some who have to lower their wages to accommodate customers, and after receiving business, apprentices are used to replace the positions of senior tailors, resulting in the customers' clothes being ruined, so they have to redo them or refund the deposit.</p>
<p>What makes the boss most headache and have to perfunctorily deal with is the fact that some "superiors" in the territory who are related to the business often unreasonably demand price reductions, at least 15% off. The boss really doesn't want to, but still has to say "please help." This is really a bitter pill to swallow, an unspeakable pain.</p>
<h3>Support Labor Organizations - Promote Labor-Management Coordination - Minister Gu Discusses Labor Policy</h3>
<p>Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang arrived in Shanghai yesterday to attend the National Seafarers' Congress. He also hosted a banquet for all the seafarers' representatives at 6 p.m. yesterday, inviting Special Commissioner Yang, Secretary-General Xie, and others to accompany him. After the banquet, he met with reporters and said: "Our current task should be to support labor organizations, improve the lives of workers, raise the status of workers, promote labor-management coordination, and improve labor efficiency. Today's Chinese workers should strive to consolidate national unity and maintain production." When asked about his opinion on the request of workers in various factories in the city for year-end bonuses, Gu said: "Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses, although there was this practice in the past, the difficulties faced by various manufacturers are also a fact. I have discussed this with Mayor Wu, and the city government will formulate a method to decide separately. In short, labor and management must understand and sympathize with each other."</p>
<h3>The Leather Industry is Under Heavy Pressure - Most are in a State of Semi-Stagnation - Twenty-Six Companies Bankrupt, Thousands of Workers Unemployed</h3>
<p>According to people in the leather goods manufacturing industry: There are more than 350 small and medium-sized leather goods manufacturing factories in Shanghai. Last month, 26 of them went bankrupt due to the pressure of high-interest loans and were unable to support themselves. As the end of the year approaches, it is expected that a small half of the leather goods factories will not be able to get through it safely. The reasons are: (1) Plastic leather goods are dumped on the market and are filled with the market. Because of their cheap prices and good quality, domestic leather goods cannot compete with them. (2) High-interest loans have reached 30%, increasing production costs, and the products are not sold, resulting in sluggish turnover. (3) Wages are increasing, and workers' meals are rising with prices. (4) Transportation from other places is difficult, and the original sales areas before the war cannot be unblocked, and the purchasing power of the local area is weak. It is reported that most of the leather goods manufacturing factories are currently in a state of semi-stagnation, with only a dozen workers making large leather suitcases to maintain the situation. As for small leather goods, the production rate is high and the supply exceeds the demand, so thousands of workers have been suspended. At this time of winter, they all have the risk of not being able to keep warm and fed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Nursery to Expand</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nursery at 114 Zhongzheng South Second Road has a beautiful environment and good facilities, and pays great attention to children's nutrition and physical and mental education. Recently, in response to the demands of working women from all walks of life, the nursery plans to expand its site and will recruit day and night childcare from next month.</p>
<h3>Two Car Accidents Injure Pedestrians</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At 6:20 p.m. yesterday, in front of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road, a young woman named Xiong Zhuang was hit in the foot by car number 50763. The driver of the accident, Qu Pincheng, was taken to the police station by the traffic police for questioning. At 7 p.m., a bus (car number 217) at the intersection of Republic of China Road and Fangbang Road injured Zhou Taoren (20 years old, from Zhenjiang, a tailor) due to careless driving. The wheel ran over Zhou's abdomen. The injured person was rushed to Renji Hospital by the nearby police, but because the injury was too serious, his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Lover of the Protagonist in the Seductive Corpse Case Arrested for Stealing on Jianguo Road</h3>
<p>At about 4 p.m. yesterday, a theft occurred at 6, Lane 336, Jianguo West Road. A thief took the opportunity to enter and intended to steal. At that time, he was discovered by Luo Biying, the owner of the house, who arrested the thief and copied out the original item. She then called the police to the scene and took him to the局for questioning. After interrogation by the handling officer Yang Jingwen, the suspect confessed without denial. Afterwards, fingerprint identification revealed that the suspect had repeatedly committed theft in the Taishan Branch and was the lover of Lao Qi (Chen Huifang), the protagonist in the seductive corpse case at the Taishan Apartment. The interrogation has now been completed and he will be transferred to the court for legal proceedings today.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Dies After Jumping Off a Moving Vehicle</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Cao Chuan, a 22-year-old apprentice carpenter from Ningbo at 48 Hongqiao Road, took bus number 35449 from the front of Jiaotong University in Xujiahui to the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Maclaud Road at about 10 a.m. on the 7th. Unexpectedly, the car had not stopped, and Cao jumped down, suffering serious injuries to his head, face, and arms. The police at the Xingjing Branch rushed to the scene and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Huashan Road for treatment. Unfortunately, due to a broken skull and excessive bleeding, he died in the hospital yesterday morning. The body was transported to the autopsy office for examination.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiting "Resistance Currency" Case - Court to Hold Public Trial This Afternoon</h3>

<h3>Shanghai's Fur Trade</h3>
<p>The fur production areas are in the north, with Tianjin and Beijing as the central hubs for the fur trade. Many businesses in Shanghai also engage in the fur trade, commonly known as fur trading companies. Currently, companies like "Tian Fa Xiang" and "Da Ji Cheng" are considered major players, mostly concentrated around Henan Road. The number of fur stores, large and small, has dwindled to just eleven, a two-thirds decrease compared to pre-war times. Additionally, there are fur businesses that wholesale grain. Large fashion stores like "Hong Xiang" also sell fur items, but these are primarily ready-made coats. As for the fur shops operated by many foreign merchants, they are mainly located along Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Avenue Joffre, catering primarily to foreign customers.</p>
<p>Fur is categorized into two groups based on its origin: "West Pass" and "North Pass." West Pass furs come from the Shaanxi and Gansu regions, while North Pass furs come from the Northeast and the Jehol, Chahar, and northern Hebei areas, with Zhangjiakou serving as their distribution center. All furs in Shanghai are brought in by fur merchants. These traveling fur merchants are called "fur guests" and act as intermediaries between the fur companies and the production areas. Every year, as the autumn winds begin, they purchase furs in the production areas and set off south in groups. By the time they arrive in Jiangnan, the autumn season is not yet deep, and the fur business is just starting to pick up. Upon arriving in Shanghai, the fur guests immediately seek out their regular customers, lodging with fur companies. The fur companies generally host them with banquets. After the goods arrive by cart, a date is set to gather the heads of all the fur companies to view the samples and determine the price levels. Once the goods are sold, they prepare to return north as the spring breeze blows. When they depart, they obtain advance payments from the fur companies, often amounting to tens of thousands. They use this money to purchase goods in the production areas, so their transportation relies entirely on trust.</p>
<p>The fur trade is a seasonal business. The operating period is only three months in the winter. The success or failure of the entire year's business depends on these three months. Those who want to add new fur garments usually prepare before the Lunar New Year. Once the New Year is over, no matter how chilling the late spring, few people inquire about furs. Some also engage in selling summer cloth fans and other items during the summer. Since the War of Resistance, fur supplies have been disrupted. Since the victory, the war in Zhangjiakou has prevented the flow of goods. Coupled with the sluggish market, how many people can afford new fur coats costing hundreds of thousands or even millions?</p>
<p>Currently, most furs are made into women's coats, with men's long robes accounting for less than one-tenth. The most popular are badger fur, cat fur, white-fronted muskrat, and sheepskin. Men's robes are mostly made of white sheepskin, gray squirrel, and fox fur, with prices ranging from 200,000 to over 1 million. More expensive yellow weasel fur, black fox, gray-backed squirrel, and leopard skin are all priced at over 1 to 2 million, and their sales are very limited. As for rare sable, everyone treats it as an antique, buying and selling it at prices reaching tens of millions.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Fur</h3>
<p>— Special Article from This Newspaper</p>
<p>The Siberian cold wave has swept into Shanghai. In the cold northwest wind, winter fur garments have become the seasonal attire. Women don fox or gray-backed squirrel coats, fully displaying their noble status. But how would they know the hardships of the hunters patrolling the ice and snow? It must be known that a coat worth a thousand pieces of gold cannot be made from the fur of a single fox!</p>
<p>People in the hunting and fishing era knew that animal skins were excellent for keeping warm. As society evolved, fur clothing became the exclusive domain of the nobility. In the past imperial era, fur coats could not be worn casually. There was a saying: "First-rank officials wear black fox, second-rank officials wear sable, third- and fourth-rank officials wear black otter." People of a certain class were only allowed to wear a certain type of fur. Wearing something above one's rank was not only ridiculed by society but also forbidden by law. However, after the influence of Western fashion spread eastward, more men began to wear Western suits, or even silk and cotton robes if not wearing Western suits. Women disliked fur coats for being too bulky, obscuring their slender figures, and disliked wearing them even more. Fur clothing, once considered a luxurious garment, was abandoned by everyone. It was not until recent years, when women began to wear fur coats, that fur clothing, favored by beauties, slightly recovered its former status.</p>
<p>Because fur clothing has been regarded as a treasure among clothes throughout the ages (pictured is a Persian lamb coat popular in the United States and Britain), those engaged in the fur trade have always made a threefold profit. During the years when no one wore fur coats, the fur trade plummeted. In the past, valuable fur items were treasured as heirlooms, but now they are considered a joke. Fortunately, women's fur coats are popular, so even though they may lose in one area, they gain in another, but it is still not as prosperous as in its heyday. To remedy the crisis, the focus should be on exports.</p>
<h3>Large Exports of Sheepskin, Nearly Ten Million Pieces Sold Overseas Annually</h3>
<p>China is one of the world's sheep-raising countries, and sheepskin is a major export. Nearly ten million pieces are sold overseas each year, providing a small contribution to balancing international payments. The Northeast and Mongolia are vast plains, natural pastures with a large number of cattle and sheep. Sichuan Province in the south has a particularly rich output. This sheepskin is concentrated in Zhangjiakou and Hankou, and exported from Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The production process of sheepskin is divided into four steps: (1) slaughtering, (2) skinning, (3) trimming, and (4) drying. Sheep are usually killed by hitting their heads with an iron hammer to make them lose consciousness, then cutting their throats to release the blood. Some also tie the sheep to a wooden board and kill them, called "tied slaughter," which easily contaminates the fur, resulting in inferior boards. In Sichuan and Shaanxi, there is a method of killing running sheep. The slaughterer rides on the sheep's back, uses his hand to lift the sheep's head, stabs its throat with a knife, then releases it. The sheep runs and jumps, blood flowing all over the ground, until it is exhausted and dies, a very tragic scene.</p>
<p>Once the sheep is killed, it must be skinned. The skill of skinning varies greatly, significantly affecting the quality of the leather. Purely using a knife to skin often damages the leather. The skinning method in Neijiang and Chengdu is the most ingenious. One side is massaged with fists, while the other side is pulled with hands, using as little force as possible. When skinning, avoid separating the head from the body, and the neck should not be narrower than five centimeters, because the United States welcomes whole sheepskins.</p>
<p>The peeled sheepskin still needs to be trimmed before drying. All the fat, meat layer, mud, ash, etc., remaining on the leather must be removed. The skin on the knees should be completely removed, and the protruding area on the head should be minimized and also trimmed. When trimming, do not damage the leather or leave knife marks on the skin. Also, do not wash with water. Washing with water will remove the oily luster, and the fur will become stiff and astringent, becoming a "water-soaked board."</p>
<p>Sheepskin is dried, partly by wind and partly by sunlight, to perfect the fur. Generally, companies that buy sheepskin have "drying grounds." When it rains, they place the skins in "air-drying yards." Some also bake the skins with fire because they are in a hurry to deliver the goods, called "fire pit boards." Generally, sheepskin slaughtered and skinned in the production area is dried and transported to the distribution center, where it is trimmed and re-dried to ensure that the leather meets export standards.</p>
<p>In the Jiaxing, Wuxing, Changxing, and Pinghu areas of Zhejiang, a small lambskin is produced, and the annual export volume is also not small. Farmers in the area generally raise two or three sheep. Pregnant ewes are sold when they are full-term, or lambs are sold after the ewes give birth, which is also one of the farmers' side businesses. Small lambskin is divided into two types: fetal and belly-peeled. The former is skinned from newborn lambs, while the latter involves killing pregnant ewes, taking out the fetal lambs, and skinning them, which is extremely cruel. Slaughtering fetal lambs is prohibited, but merchants are driven by profit and disregard the restrictions. Those who prohibit do so, while those who kill do so regardless.</p>
<p>Exported sheepskin is all raw hide. The largest market is the United States, but there are also sales in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, and India. Prices vary depending on the thickness of the base, the length of the fur tips, and the brightness of the color. Currently, there are more than ten companies in Shanghai engaged in sheepskin exports. From January to September this year, 1,106,279 sheepskins were exported in nine months, worth a total of 2,956,710,000 legal currency.</p>
<h3>Three Movements of Fur Clothing: Hunting, Breeding, Production</h3>
<p>Hunting is the first step in obtaining fur. Farmers in the northwest and northeast valleys engage in hunting as a side business. Every year, when the autumn is high and the horses are fat, it is the time for hunting. Hunters carry hunting dogs and go into the mountains in groups. They first burn dry grass to deprive the wild animals of hiding places, and then surround and attack them. Experienced hunters have ample knowledge of animals. They know which kind of wild animals lurk in which area, which kind of wild animals come out at what time, and they can also observe the hoof prints left on the soil to know the whereabouts of the wild animals. They are resolute and brave, and very careful, spending the cold winter in deep mountains and forests. Hunters mostly shoot animals with earth guns, but they also use other methods depending on the habits of the animals. For example, they set nets to catch gray squirrels, and one net can catch hundreds of them. Hunting is supposed to have time and area regulations, and one should not be greedy. However, Chinese hunters do not pay attention to this, so the animals are caught less and less. Those that have not grown up have small skins and short fur, and the quality is reduced. Some rare wild animals are hunted indiscriminately, even to the point of extinction. Earth gun shooting is more likely to damage the quality of the fur, so there are so-called "inferior boards." All of this should be noted.</p>
<p>Wild animals are difficult to catch, and their reproduction is left to nature. They cannot be hunted wantonly, so joyful enclosures for artificial breeding have been established. However, wild animals raised in cages not only cannot reproduce, but their fur color and luster are also not as good as those grown naturally. Therefore, large pastures must be used, imitating the layout of the wilderness and mountains for raising them, which is no different from the natural environment. Recently, after scientific improvement, there are also several animals that can be raised in cages. Therefore, after the prevalence of artificial breeding methods, the output of fur from many precious animals can be greatly increased. The breeding of fur animals began with rabbit farming in Germany. Rabbits are domestic animals and are easier to raise. The United States was the first to artificially breed wild animals. Alaska was originally a good fur-producing area. Because fur imports increased day by day, farms were established there to try to raise mink, and the output increased greatly in a few years. Mink fur was originally yellow-brown. The genetic principle was changed, and artificial mating was used, so new species were produced. Among them, pure white and dark blue are more popular in the market.</p>
<p>The vast forests of Siberia are full of wild animal tracks. Russian fur has long been famous in Europe. The glossy gray squirrel and the light and warm sable are all treasured by the world. After the success of artificial animal breeding in the United States, the Soviet Union followed suit. In various parts of Siberia, all areas suitable for animal life have been turned into animal breeding gardens, either capturing young animals and raising them to help them grow, or using artificial methods to breed them. Especially on the coast near the Arctic Ocean, farms are set up to raise sea dogs, which can compete with the mink of Alaska. Looking at other countries, they are becoming more and more advanced, while Chinese hunters only know how to catch animals and do not know how to protect the source of wealth. Once the wild animals disappear, where will they get their fur? This is really a short-sighted strategy of killing the chicken to get the eggs.</p>
<p>Hunters obtain wild animals, peel off their skins, and carry them to the market for sale. In the Zhangjiakou and Baotou areas, teams of camels and carts are loaded with smelly animal skins, all obtained by the hard work of the hunters. There are many fur workshops there that make fur goods to supply the fur merchants from the mainland. The scale of the fur workshops is very small, and everything is made by hand. After buying the raw hides, they first scrape off the rotten meat attached to the inside of the leather, and then treat it with saltpeter and tidy it up, which is considered complete. The smell of raw hides and saltpeter mixed in the fur workshop is very irritating. It is said that workers in fur workshops rarely live past the age of fifty, because the foul smell destroys their lives. A fur coat cannot be made from a single animal skin. This cutting and matching work is not an easy task. The density of the fur, the length of the fur tips, and the color and luster must be very similar before they can be matched into a fur coat. At the same time, the size and number of pieces will affect the price. The completion of a fur coat really takes a lot of effort, which is something that people who wear fur coats would not think of.</p>
<p>The traditional method of leather making easily damages the color and luster of the fur. In the past, some of the leather goods exported by China were refined overseas and re-imported into China. In one turn of the hand, the profits were unknown. Now, after the development of artificial breeding in the United States, the export of raw hides has decreased, and the import of refined fur has increased, further causing the industry to plummet. I don't know how to save this decline in the future?</p>
<h3>Various Kinds of Fur Clothing</h3>
<p>China is worthy of being a country with vast land and abundant resources. Even the types of fur clothing, from the tigers and leopards of the tropics to the sables and foxes of the frigid zone, have products. When you choose to buy fur, the shop assistants will tell you like a family treasure.</p>
<p>Sable fur is a treasure among fur goods. In the past, not only could sable fur coats not be worn casually, but even a sable fur hat was a very precious thing given by the emperor. It is said that wearing a sable fur coat and standing in the wind and snow is warmer than being indoors, which is why it is so precious. Sable is a very small carnivorous animal, two feet and five inches long, with short ears and a pointed snout, shaped like a rat, with yellow-black fur with purple, and pure white ones called silver sable, and black ones called purple sable. It is produced in the Dunhua and Yanji areas of eastern Liaoning, and in the Mudanling and Sanxing areas, and the ones produced in the Harba Ridge are the best. It lives in the forest during the day and comes out at night to find black rats and other animals to eat. Hunters stand in the forest, hold their breath and shoot it quietly. The fur of one sable is not even a foot square. It takes sixty sables to make a fur coat, which is so difficult to obtain. A sable fur coat currently costs six or seven million.</p>
<p>Fox Fur</p>
<p>Fox fur is also a top-grade product. Its ability to keep out the cold and warm the body is slightly inferior to sable, but its lightness and softness are similar to sable. Foxes are produced in the north and are relatively common animals, three or four feet long, shaped like dogs but slightly thinner, with reddish-yellow fur. They are cunning and suspicious, live in holes in the forest, and hide during the day and come out at night. They are found in the Sanxing area of Jilin in the northeast and the Kulun area of Mongolia. There are many varieties, and the prices vary greatly. The most popular on the market is the black fox, which is the most precious, with pure black fur, followed by yellow fox and white fox, which are also top-grade products. The former has thicker fur tips, yellow and bright color, and the latter has pure white fur, fine, soft and shiny. Other popular ones include red fox, black otter fox, and the Geshan fox south of the Great Wall, and the Xilu fox of Shaanxi and Gansu. The lowest quality is the grass fox, produced in the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas of Zhejiang. The price of a fox fur coat ranges from two or three million for the expensive ones to forty or fifty thousand for the grass fox. The fur of the fox armpit is white and is collected to make a fur coat, which is the lightest and warmest, so it is also a famous product. History says that Lord Mengchang had a white fox fur coat worth a thousand pieces of gold, which shows how precious it was.</p>
<p>Rat Fur</p>
<p>Rat fur is also a top-grade fur, no less than fox fur. Rats are common animals, but rats whose fur can be made into fur coats are not the ones we usually see. The "Shuowen" says: "The ... rat comes from the Dingling Hu, and its fur can be made into a fur coat." This is the commonly known gray squirrel, which is produced in the fields of Heilongjiang and Jilin, and the ones produced near the Xing'an Mountains and Nenjiang are even better. The fur is thick, blackish-blue, and the abdomen is white. Making fur coats with it results in a black background with white spots. Today, women make coats, disliking the white spots, and only take the back, called the gray back, which is more expensive than the ones made from the whole sheet. A gray back coat currently costs around three million.</p>
<p>There is also a silver rat, whose fur is pure white, and its fur can also be made into fur coats. Silver rats are produced in Outer Mongolia and Siberia, and are slightly larger than gray squirrels, with dense fur that is white and shiny. The sales of silver rats are not as popular as gray squirrels. In the past, they were only used as decorations on clothes - called "wind vents". Western women, however, like silver rats and like to use silver rats to make wedding dresses, taking their purity. Most of the rabbits on the market are made of silver rats, but the fur color is not as good.</p>
<p>Currently, a white-fronted muskrat is popular on the market. It is also a type of rat fur produced in the Jiang, Zhe, Wan, and Gan areas, with gray color and hairy fur, with a white fur bottom, more than one foot long. In the past, it was sold exclusively to the United Kingdom and the United States for making women's coats. In recent years, many domestic women have also used it, and a coat costs from hundreds of thousands to more than one million.</p>
<p>Sheepskin</p>
<p>Sheepskin should be listed as a second-class product in fur goods. In fact, the fur color and quality of sheepskin vary greatly, and the prices are also very different. Sheepskin is mainly made of sheep, and lambskin is light and tender, so it is better. In the Zhehu area, fetal sheep are slaughtered to obtain their skins, which is a side business for farmers. The ones produced in the Shaanxi and Gansu areas are black fur, called black purple lamb, and their price is even more expensive. The provinces of Yu, Lu, Yan, and Jin like to slaughter newborn lambs, called slippery skins, which are used exclusively for making mattress pads, and the price is not cheap.</p>
<p>Sheep are mostly slaughtered in winter, taking their long fur and velvet. The best quality is called Nan skin, with curly hair about three inches long, which is smooth when turned over, shiny, soft and light. The ones produced in the Gansu, Shaanxi, Qing, and Ning areas are the best. A Nan skin robe is worth two or three hundred thousand. There is also a type called Chongtan, whose fur is thick and has no bottom velvet, so it is second to Nan skin.</p>
<p>Qing sheep are produced in Gansu, with white fur and greenish roots, fine, long and soft. Pearl skin is sheepskin with short and curly fur, with thick velvet, named for its pearl-like appearance, and is also produced in the Shaanxi and Gansu areas. Both are top-grade products of sheepskin.</p>
<p>Yellow Weasel Skin</p>
<p>Yellow weasel skin is produced in various parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. After winter, farmers catch and slaughter them. The fur is yellow. The ones produced in Jiangxi Province are the deepest, and the ones produced in Shandong Province are the lightest. The male ones have abundant fur and thin leather, and the female ones have thick leather and fine fur tips. In the past, they were exported to foreign countries in large numbers every year. During the war, foreign sales were cut off, and the Tianjin and Shanghai leather factories carried out self-nitrification and self-dyeing, making leather coats, which were very popular with women.</p>
<p>Lynx Skin</p>
<p>Lynx skin is also extremely precious. A coat costs two million. The Lynx is an aquatic animal, shaped like a civet cat, with long fur all over its body, light gray on the back, and white on the chest and abdomen, interspersed with black round spots, forming a grape shape. Produced in Tibet and the northeast, the ones produced in Mongolia are the best, the ones produced in the northeast are slightly yellow, so the quality is slightly lower, and the ones produced in Tibet have fine fur and no strength, even less. The finished fur has shoulders. There are separate parts for the thighs and legs. There are also those made by mixing several whole lynxes, inlaid with the front and back sleeves into six strips, called "six ridge spines". The armpits are made of the skin of the chest and abdomen and are the most valuable.</p>
<p>Otter</p>
<p>Otters are shaped like weasels, more than three feet long, with flat heads, large eyes, short limbs, and webbed feet. They live in holes in the water and eat fish. The whole body is covered with fine, long hair. In summer, it is black, and in winter, it is slightly red. Its skin can also be made into a fur coat. There are river otters, Guan otters, and Tibetan otters. River otters are produced in Xiang, Shu, Yunnan, and Guizhou. The river otters in Baoqing, Hunan are the best. Guan otters are produced in the northeast, with firm fur and very short tips. Tibetan otters refer to products from Tibet, with extremely thick hair, six or seven minutes long, and are the top grade of otter skin.</p>
<p>Elk</p>
<p>Elk is a type of wild dog, with long fur and thick velvet, brownish-black, and is a good product for keeping out the cold. Many are produced in the northeast, as well as Yuqian, Changhua in Zhejiang, and Liyang and Jintan in Jiangsu. There are also sales in the UK and the US.</p>
<p>Tiger, Leopard and Rabbit Skin</p>
<p>The skin of tigers and leopards is a decorative item in the beds and sofas of wealthy families, and some are used to make clothes. Tigers and leopards are produced in mountainous areas. The Jiangda Mountains and Mudanling in the northeast, and the provinces of Dian, Qian, Chuan, and Kang in the southwest are all producing areas. However, they are difficult to catch, so the output is very small. The market is often filled with mountain cat skin, which is lighter in color, but the black spots are quite similar.</p>
<p>Rabbit skin is divided into domestic rabbits and wild rabbits. The wild rabbits produced in the northeast are the best, with slightly ... fur, about three inches long, extremely soft, and the ones produced in Nenjiang are even better. There are also wild rabbits in the lakes and marshes of Jiang, Zhe, and Wan, with fur that is reed-colored, and are only sold overseas for making hats, and rarely for making fur coats. Domestic rabbits take those with pure white fur and are special products of Sichuan. The output of other provinces is very small and is mainly for export, with an annual export of about 2 million sheets.</p>

<h3>Year-End Approaching, Manufacturers' Crisis Deepening, Eagerly Hoping for Government Relief</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, due to the oppression of high-interest loans and the dumping of foreign goods, general industry and commerce have been severely affected. Expenditures have increased, and business has been sluggish. Rumors of bankruptcy and liquidation are often heard. As the year-end approaches, the crisis deepens. This reporter specially visited a prominent leader of the industrial and commercial circles in this city. According to him, the difficulties faced by industry and commerce in this city are well-known facts. Since the municipal chamber of commerce sent representatives to Beijing in July to petition, the suffering they have endured has been exposed to society, openly appealing for help. Later, the municipal council also sent a petition delegation to Beijing. At the beginning of last month, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry held a meeting in Beijing, with more concrete demands. As far as I know, except for a few cotton yarn weaving factories, most manufacturers in Shanghai are struggling to maintain operations. The current precarious situation is only the beginning. If the government does not provide practical assistance before the New Year, I am afraid that most of them will be stranded. It is estimated that there are 300,000 workers in the factories of this city. In addition to the workers in state-owned and private yarn factories, who account for one-third, if other factories close down, a large number of workers will immediately suffer unemployment, which will have a significant impact on social stability. Recalling a few months ago, only a few thousand laid-off workers rioted in the municipal government due to lack of work. This time, the unemployment of stallholders has also caused a huge wave. If a large number of workers are unemployed at the end of the year, the public will be agitated, and the order of Shanghai will be even more unimaginable. In addition, the debt settlement problem after the closure of factories is also a major social event. Currently, most manufacturers rely on high-interest loans to maintain their operations. This funding does not come from banks but is borrowed from all levels of society. If widespread stagnation occurs, it will cause a chain reaction, involving a wide range of people. Therefore, for the sake of social stability, I deeply feel that industry and commerce cannot be allowed to collapse. I hope that the government can plan countermeasures as soon as possible and quickly release low-interest loans to allow them to turn around and avoid bankruptcy, so that social stability can be preserved.</p>
<h3>Ten Reasons for the Rise in Gold Prices Analyzed by an Observer</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Gold prices have been rising steadily, with new highs seen every day. According to an analysis by an observer, the reasons are nothing more than the following ten points. (1) Recently, gold prices in various regions have been trending strongly. Taking Hong Kong gold prices as an example, if calculated at the current Hong Kong exchange rate, it is equivalent to 3.45 million. Gold prices in Tianjin, for example, have also reached 3.2 million. (2) After foreign merchants transport goods to Shanghai for sale, most of them like to use the proceeds to purchase gold and return to their hometown. (3) The situation is unstable, and it is rumored that all taxes and donations in the "liberated areas" of the Communist army must be paid in gold. (4) The rumor that foreign exchange will be adjusted again is still brewing. (5) In the past, holders of large amounts of US dollars, now that the revised import trade regulations have been promulgated, US dollars may lose their effectiveness, so they are rushing to exchange dollars for gold. (6) The trend of loan interest rates has been gradually unstable recently due to the impact of the sluggish economy. And the degree to which gold prices have risen is no less than the interest earned, so they are withdrawing loans and buying gold to protect themselves. (7) The trend of currency is still inflation. (8) The amount of gold sold by the Central Bank is not large, so it has failed to control the gold market. (9) The stock market has been consolidating for a long time and is lifeless, so the funds in the stock market have also turned to gold. (10) Small money houses have also started to engage in gold trading, and it is not uncommon for them to trade fifty or one hundred bars at a time. Moreover, they have started gold futures trading, and general speculators are flocking to it.</p>
<h3>November Tung Oil Export Totals 4,200 Tons, Production Target for Next Year is 1,658,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Tung oil exports have always been a matter of concern to various parties. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai office of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the total amount of tung oil exported in November was 4,200 tons, of which 2,200 tons were transported and sold by the factory, and the remaining 2,000 tons were transported and sold directly by various tung oil merchants. In order to generally increase the production of tung oil in various regions and reach the pre-war level, the factory has specially stipulated the production targets for tung oil in various regions for the 36th year as follows: (1) Sichuan Region: 488,000 dan, including Wanxian, Chongqing, Yunyang, Fengjie, Kaixian, Fuling and other areas. (2) Hubei Region: 450,000 dan, including Hankou, Laohekou, Yichang, Xiangyang and other areas. (3) Hunan Region: 400,000 dan, including Changsha, Changde, Yuanling and other areas. (4) Zhejiang Region: 170,000 dan, including Hangzhou, Lanxi, Wenzhou and other areas. (5) Guangxi Region: 150,000 dan, including Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Yongning and other areas. The total for the above five regions is 1,658,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Revision of the Weights and Measures Business Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has recently received an order from the Executive Yuan, instructing the National Government to revise Articles 3 and 4 of the Weights and Measures Business Regulations. The revised content of the articles is extracted as follows: Article 3: Applicants engaged in manufacturing shall pay a license fee in accordance with the following items. (1) Those using powered machinery and employing 30 or more workers on a regular basis: 10,000 yuan. (2) Those using powered machinery and employing less than 30 workers on a regular basis: 6,000 yuan. (3) Those using manual manufacturing and employing 30 or more workers on a regular basis: 4,000 yuan. (4) Those using manual manufacturing and employing 10 or more workers on a regular basis: 2,000 yuan. (5) Those using manual manufacturing and employing less than 10 workers on a regular basis: 1,000 yuan. Article 4: Applicants engaged in sales or repair shall pay a license fee in accordance with the following items: (1) Sellers: 4,000 yuan, (2) Repairers: 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lack of Coal Briquette Raw Materials, Mud Coal Briquettes Revived</h3>
<p>During the enemy-puppet period, due to the interruption of coal dust supply, coal merchants in this city mixed mud into coal dust to make coal briquettes and sold them indiscriminately in the market. It is recently learned that due to the sudden increase in coal briquette prices and the shortage of coal dust, these coal briquettes containing a large amount of mud have reappeared on the market. Some coal merchants are taking the opportunity to repeat the old tune, indiscriminately manufacturing and supplying them to the market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Northeast Soybean Exports Expected to Increase Next Year</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] According to an announcement here: Soybean exports from the nine provinces of Northeast China will reach 220,000 tons next year. This was only 10,000 tons in 1946. The British trade delegation to China is currently inspecting China and hopes to purchase a large quantity of soybeans for the manufacture of artificial cheese.</p>
<h3>United States Purchases Silk, First Batch is 50,000 Pieces, But Purchase Price is Only 70% of Our City Price</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It was recently reported that the United States will purchase 200,000 pieces of silk from China through the introduction of Sino-American Industrial Corporation. The reporter recently inquired about this information from the authorities of Sino-American Corporation and relevant parties. It is learned that this negotiation is still in progress. The first batch of purchases by the United States is 50,000 pieces, and the purchase price they are willing to pay is only 70% of the market price in our country. Silk factories are now requesting the Central Trust Bureau to sell the raw silk purchased by the Bureau to various weaving factories at a cost price of US$6.50 per pound, so as to reduce the cost of silk and meet the needs of the United States. At the same time, it is pointed out that the sales of raw silk in the United States are very sluggish due to the competition from Japanese silk. It is better to process and manufacture it. Furthermore, exporting the best quality raw silk to foreign countries and using inferior silk for weaving silk in our own country will cause the domestically produced silk to lose its overseas market, which is not a good policy. It is now learned that after repeated requests, the Central Trust Bureau has agreed to supply raw silk at a low price. Each piece of silk requires 16 pounds of silk, and the estimated supply is very large. The silk industry in this city is waiting for the results of the negotiations in the United States. Once the contract is signed, a meeting will be held to discuss the allocation of production volume to each factory. According to relevant people, some factories with smaller equipment may not be able to undertake the production due to technical reasons. At the same time, it is hoped that the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau can supply raw materials in the fastest possible steps, so that the factories can start production and overcome the crisis before being forced to collapse by high-interest loans.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Prevents Capital Flight, Prohibits Establishing Banks Abroad, Those Without Approval Must Withdraw Within Five Days</h3>
<p>The outflow of funds from our country is quite serious. The reasons are: the domestic situation is unstable, the industry and commerce are in recession, and the taxes are heavy. Therefore, people who have no national concept and only seek personal gain are engaged in transferring their private property abroad. According to financial circles, the funds flowing into Hong Kong alone have reached more than 3 million yuan. At the same time, more than 40 shops and factories run by Chinese industrialists and businessmen have been approved by the Hong Kong authorities. The government authorities have paid attention to the development of this matter. The Ministry of Finance's first step is to ban domestic financial institutions from establishing branches abroad without prior approval. It has already ordered the Shanghai Bankers' Association to inform its members that if there is any of the above situation, they should immediately cancel and report to the Ministry within five days of receiving the document. If there is any delay, they will be severely punished once they are found out. The Banking and Currency Association has notified the respective banks and firms to comply with the order.</p>
<h3>Salted Fish Also Purchased from the United States, Fishery Organizations Prepare to Form an Aquatic Education Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The current winter season is a prosperous period for the fishery market. The fishery industry in this city recently ordered more than 50 tons of salted fish from the United States to meet the needs of this city and surrounding areas. They will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month successively. These fish are all in barrels, and the price per ton is 54,000 yuan in legal tender at the legal exchange rate. Upon arrival, the fish will be sold by the joint office of the National Fisheries Corporation. In order to increase the production of fresh and salted fish in our country, the four fishery companies of Jiangzhe, China, Southeast, and Jiangsu have departed to the Shengsi Islands and near Chongming Island to catch hairtail, and will return by the middle of the first month of next year. At present, the daily sales of fish in the fishery market and the 16th Pier are 500,000 catties, or 250 tons. The fishing technology in our country is far from meeting the required quantity. Therefore, the National Fisheries Corporation has prepared to form the National Aquatic Education Promotion Association to promote fishery education.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Yarn Allocation, Textile Control Commission Will Decide</h3>
<p>The first yarn allocation for the fourth period of the textile industry was originally scheduled to be allocated to the six reproduction industry associations, a total of 4,775 pieces, the day before yesterday according to the scheduled method. As for the yarn number industry, due to the yarn wholesalers' request for fair distribution of 1,500 pieces of yarn, a dispute arose with the association and the fight sellers, and the allocation was temporarily suspended.

<h3>2,000 Yuan Counterfeit Notes of the 34th Year Edition</h3>
<p>Exquisitely Printed, Difficult to Distinguish</p>
<p>Recently, 2,000 yuan counterfeit banknotes of the 34th year edition of the Central Bank have been discovered in the market in this city. The number is quite large. Moreover, the counterfeit banknotes are exquisitely printed. It is difficult to distinguish the authenticity without careful identification. The Central Bank and the Garrison Command have paid close attention and have begun to investigate the source of the counterfeit banknotes. It is reported that the differences between genuine and counterfeit banknotes are as follows: The area of ​​the banknotes is 4 cun 8 fen and a half (city feet) long and 2 cun (city feet) wide, which is the same for both genuine and counterfeit. The genuine banknote paper is rougher and darker, while the counterfeit banknote paper is smooth and white. The color of the genuine banknote is purplish brown, while the counterfeit banknote is purplish red. The distinguishable place on the front of the banknote is the eyebrows of Sun Yat-sen's portrait. The genuine banknote is clear and obvious, while the counterfeit banknote is blurred. The color of the president and vice president of the Central Bank and the numbers on the left and right sides are red for the genuine banknote and orange-yellow for the counterfeit banknote. Moreover, the font of the genuine banknote number is thicker and smaller, while the font of the counterfeit banknote number is longer and thinner. The English letters at the beginning of the counterfeit banknote number are mostly "BE". There is not much difference on the reverse of the banknote. Only the color of the genuine banknote is clear and obvious, while the counterfeit banknote is blurred.</p>

<h3>Commodity Inspection Work Gradually Decreases Recently</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the victory and restoration, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, under the leadership of Director Cai Wuji, has been actively engaged in commodity inspection, intending to examine the quality of commodities and increase the credibility of our country's commodities in the international market. At the beginning of the victory, there were many commodities accumulated in the country waiting to be shipped overseas, and those who sent them to the bureau for inspection due to cost prices were very enthusiastic. The bureau felt very burdened when it was restored. In recent months, most of the commodities accumulated in the country have been shipped overseas, and domestic products are mostly unwilling to export due to costs and foreign exchange issues. Except for commodities operated by the state, very few merchants send them to the bureau for inspection. The commodity inspection bureau divides commodity inspection into five offices: (1) Agricultural Products Inspection Office, including beans and tea, (2) Livestock Products Inspection Office, including bristles, casings, ham, wool, etc., (3) Chemical Products Inspection Office, including fertilizers and vegetable oils, (4) Plant Pest Inspection Office, including vegetables and fruits, (5) Silk Inspection Office, including silkworm seeds and raw silk. In addition, a general affairs office is set up to manage the internal organization. The inspection steps vary according to the type and quality of the commodity. Large beans inspection focuses on adulterants, tea is judged by color, aroma, and taste, livestock products are judged by their quality, freshness, and age, chemical products are examined for their component content, plant pests are judged by whether they are disinfected and corroded, and silkworm seeds and raw silk focus on quality and weight, or present sample inspections, or dismantle inspections, always ensuring that the credit of our country's commodities is not affected after export. The entire procedure is: apply for inspection, fill in the application form, after investigation and review, those who are qualified will be issued a permit, and only with the permit can they declare customs.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank to Hold Shengsi Islands Fishery Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shengsi Islands are the richest fish-producing area along the coast of Jiangsu Province, especially hairtail. It is learned that the Shanghai Branch of the Farmers Bank of China is holding material loans in order to regulate the finances of fishermen in the area. When capturing hairtail, a pair of fishing boats often cooperate. Therefore, this loan is based on a pair of boats as a unit, and the principle is to issue a loan of 1 million yuan worth of materials per unit. It is reported that each unit of materials includes eight stones of rice, and daily necessities for fishermen such as cigarettes, pig blood, and wine.</p>
<p>In addition, the branch will hold a three-day agricultural loan discussion meeting from today to the 9th. Participating units include representatives from the 22 county and city offices under the jurisdiction of the branch. Wang Botian, manager of the branch, will serve as chairman. It is reported that the meeting will not only review the past agricultural loan situation in the jurisdiction area, but also plan future agricultural loan plans.</p>
<h3>Amidst Brisk Sales of Glass Stockings, the Knitting Industry is in Peril</h3>
<p>The knitting factories in this city, which have been struggling to support themselves for several months, are now facing a crisis due to the brisk sales of American knitted goods. According to the reporter, more than a dozen have already closed down. According to those familiar with the inside story, in the past, the industry's products were mainly sold to other cities. Due to the internal turmoil in the past year, the transportation has been sluggish, making it impossible to produce in large quantities. If the factory reduces workers and lowers wages, the labor side will not understand and will easily cause labor disputes. Although it was possible to barely support in the first half of the year, since July, due to the continuous arrival of American "Nylon" glass stockings, the domestic knitting market has been almost seized, leading to a slump in the knitting industry. It is expected that by the end of this year, at least one-third will declare liquidation.</p>
<p>Commodity Explanation</p>
<h3>Acids and Alkalis</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>Recently, in the raw material market, acids and alkalis have simultaneously triggered a violent surge. The majority of this is speculation, and a small part is actual sales.</p>
<p>The development of a country's industry and me, can also be said to be the strength of the country. Just look at the ratio of the use of acids and alkalis, and you can tell. If the consumption of acids is greater than that of alkalis, then that country must be a strong country; conversely, if the consumption of alkalis is greater than that of acids, it must be a weak country. But in China, acids and alkalis have no place to use their abilities, so there is no talk of industry. However, the clever Chinese take acids and alkalis as speculative objects, which is also a unique style.</p>
<p>Acids and alkalis are the most important intermediate compounds in industry, so all industries cannot do without acids and alkalis.</p>
<p>The largest acid factory in our country is Kaicheng in this city. It has not been heard of producing after the war. Although Yongli also produces sulfuric acid, it can only supply the ammonium sulfate produced by itself. Therefore, the current acid manufacturing industry can be said to be unknown. As for alkali produced in our country, only Yongli manufactures soda ash. Before the war, Yongli also made caustic soda. Because the degree was slightly different and the color was red, it could not compete with Yuepai (Moon Brand). Now there is no caustic soda produced.</p>
<p>Speaking of Bu Neimen's Yuepai (Moon Brand) alkali, it can be said to have dominated the whole of China before the war. Its stock was very abundant. From the perspective of Shanghai, from the outbreak of the Pacific War until the victory, there were still 35,000 barrels in stock, which was enough for three years of consumption. This really makes you feel the greatness of the British merchants' dumping power. Before and after the victory, the price of caustic soda was 30 to 40 million yuan per barrel. After 200 yuan per share, the price per barrel was only 130 to 140,000 yuan. By this time last year, the price fluctuated greatly, and some were more than 30 yuan higher. At the highest, it simply did not talk about the value of legal tender, but replaced it with 12 taels of red silver per barrel. Later, when American merchants began to order goods, the order price was 120,000 yuan per ton, and 300 kilograms per barrel, which was only 40,000 yuan. By January of this year, the goods had arrived in port, but because the American manufacturers had never used them, there was no way to know what the quality was like, and there were very few risk takers for the first order. After the first batch of goods arrived, users were satisfied after using them, so the merchants in this city ordered a large number of goods. By March and April of this year, all orders were transferred to Shanghai via Manila, totaling as many as 50,000 to 60,000 tons. Therefore, the price fell from 1 million yuan per barrel to 180,000 yuan per barrel, but the price of American goods was always 50 to 60,000 yuan lower than that of Yuepai (Moon Brand) per barrel.</p>
<p>Since the American loan of caustic soda has overwhelmed the market, and actual sales are also very small, although there are small fluctuations sometimes, they will still return to their original position soon. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price per barrel was 420 to 430,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the United States and the Philippines banned the export of caustic soda in July, the price in this city has not skyrocketed due to abundant inventory. Actual sales are not very large, and few customers come to handle it. Although the United States and the Philippines banned exports, the goods transferred from Hong Kong are still coming in continuously. Although the number is not large, they are sold as soon as they arrive, and the inventory has not been exhausted. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the source of goods in Hong Kong was scarce due to the impact of the American seamen's strike, and there were also customers moving to handle it. The price rose slowly, and by the end of October, it had reached 800,000 yuan per barrel. Later, because the northern gang came to Shanghai to search for purchases, the dyeing and weaving factories in this city also happened to absorb a large number of American caustic soda at this time, totaling 2,000 to 3,000 barrels. According to the inventory in this city, there is not much emptiness, but because the price has risen quickly, speculators have been greedy, stirring up trouble and spreading empty sales. The market price has soared from 800,000 yuan to 1.3 million yuan. Then, due to the stagnation of actual sales, the price once again fell back to 1.1 million to 1.15 million yuan per barrel, but the speculators have not lost their ambition. At the same time, the multiple they have absorbed will inevitably collapse if they rush out. They have repeatedly hyped it up, and the daily increase has reached 400 to 500,000 yuan. The highest has reached 2.4 million yuan per barrel. However, the general users believe that more than 200 foreign shipments will arrive this month, and the number of shipments of caustic soda to Shanghai is also not small. Therefore, except for those who need it, they purchase a small amount, and it is expected that the surge can be suppressed.</p>
<p>Following caustic soda, the second type is triacid - sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid - which has also risen sharply, especially sulfuric acid, the rise is particularly strong. Because with sulfuric acid, there are two acids, which can be repackaged. Sulfuric acid is extremely scarce in the market, so there is no large amount of transactions. I won't go into details here. There is also a kind called carbolic acid, which suddenly rose in price tenfold overnight. Carbolic acid is produced when coal tar is distilled to 1750c, and is an important compound for medicine and dyes.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Appropriately Allocate a Large Number of Instruments to Middle Schools, 868 Sets of Physics Experiment Instruments, 177 Sets of Chemistry Demonstration Instruments</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Education ordered a large number of physics and chemistry instruments for secondary schools from the Academia Sinica in the 25th year. Later, due to the outbreak of war, some of them were transported and distributed to secondary schools in Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places in the 28th year. Most of them were stored in Xiangxing Company, a British merchant in Shanghai. At the end of the war last autumn, the Ministry of Education, together with the Academia Sinica, negotiated with the British merchant, and the Ministry paid the rent and insurance costs for storage over the years. The Ministry entrusted the Academia Sinica to take out all the instruments, including: 865 sets of physics experiment instruments for junior high schools, 40 sets of chemistry demonstration instruments for senior high schools, and 137 sets of chemistry demonstration instruments for junior high schools, totaling 1,042 sets. The Ministry has distributed them to national secondary schools after consulting the needs of all parties, and has ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to appropriately distribute them to provincial and municipal secondary schools for application.</p>
<h3>National Textbook Supply Problem in Spring, Director Wu Yan'yin Gave Practical Instructions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] National primary and secondary school textbooks were once rumored to be opened, so the Seven-League Supply Office did not dare to print them boldly and intended to wait and see, which will affect the spring supply. Upon hearing this, the Ministry of Education specially sent Director Wu Yan'yin of the National Education Department and Section Chief Wei Bingxin to Shanghai a few days ago to give instructions on the textbook supply problem for the spring season of the Seven-League Office. The Seven-League Office held a meeting at Fuhualou yesterday (8th) at noon and welcomed Director Wu Yan'yin and Section Chief Wei Bingxin. First, Wu Bingchang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seven-League Office, gave a welcome speech, followed by Director Wu and Section Chief Wei, who delivered speeches one after another and gave practical instructions, saying that the Seven-League Office had made special contributions to the supply of textbooks during the war and hoped that it would now fully supply the spring textbooks in accordance with the contract. The Ministry of Education has recently issued an order to all provinces and cities to strictly prohibit piracy, so the Seven-League is even more responsible and must print a large number of them as soon as possible and distribute them to various places as soon as possible. All Shanghai autumn sales stock books can be loaded and transported first. The paper illustrations and binding should be exquisite. The Four-League loans cannot be used for other purposes. The original professor's books must also be published as soon as possible. External piracy, regardless of the background, should be banned uniformly, but if there are unscrupulous elements within each family who steal and print, they should be severely punished in accordance with the contract. All old textbooks approved by each family that have been published in various subjects in the national edition, such as elementary school Chinese, common sense, arithmetic, etc., are not allowed to be sold again in accordance with the regulations, so that the supply situation can reach a perfect state. Subsequently, Gu Shusen, Zhang Yiqu, Li Bojia, Ye Suzhong, and others expressed their opinions separately. They all believed that since the Ministry of Education has given instructions on the spring supply plan and maintained the original intention, they should actively print and transport them, indicating that all the instructions have been accepted. The revised version of the professor's book, the first to fourth volumes of elementary school national common sense, has recently been submitted by the Translation and Compilation Office and will be printed immediately. Efforts have been made to print the textbooks using a reel machine. The loan is still audited by the Four-League, and there will be no misappropriation. The two sides exchanged many opinions, which was quite harmonious. It is heard that Director Wu and others will stay in Shanghai for one or two days and then return to Beijing.</p>

Schools at all levels who wish to try it out can purchase it from Mr. Zhu at No. 1, 2nd Floor, No. 470 Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>University Football: Second Act, Jiaotong Wins Over St. John's, 3-1, Jiaotong Controls the Overall Situation, St. John's Avoids a Shutout with a Penalty Kick</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the second act of the university football league, St. John's played against Jiaotong University at 2:30 p.m. yesterday at the Aurora University Stadium. As a result, Jiaotong University regained its former glory, defeating St. John's by a score of 3-1. Jiaotong University took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-0. More than 4,000 spectators attended the game. Jiaotong University students were transported by free school buses, and more than 1,000 people came to cheer, led by President Wu Baofeng, who personally led the expedition and set off firecrackers to boost morale. St. John's had only a small number of people in one corner. Although Zhu Dehui got a penalty kick opportunity before the end of the game and scored a goal, the overall situation was gone, and it was fortunate to avoid a shutout.</p>
<p>Jiaotong Takes the Lead 2-0</p>
<p>At the sound of the whistle, the players on both sides gathered their energy and began to fight. St. John's player Zhu Dehui first attacked the goal, but was held by Qin Dingxin. Jiaotong University students were overjoyed. After three minutes, Jiaotong University got a corner kick. Wang Hongshu sent a high ball, which landed in the penalty area. Deng Jingtong jumped up and scored the first goal. The cheers of the Jiaotong University cheerleaders and the double-barreled firecrackers resounded through the sky. The two sides continued to fight. At 27 minutes, Chen Shaoyuan of Jiaotong University passed a high ball from the left side of the goal to the right side of the goal. Wang Hongshu chased up and continued to attack, scoring another goal. In the first half, Jiaotong University took the lead with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Situation, He Scored Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After a break, St. John's regained its morale and launched frequent attacks, but lacked strategy, and the shooting power was too soft, and Qin Dingxin easily caught every shot. After five minutes, Chen Shaoyuan of Jiaotong University dribbled the ball straight in from the left, almost going out of bounds. The audience was lamenting it, but unexpectedly Liu Jing hooked the ball back, passed in front of the goal, and Wang Hongshu flew up and kicked the ball into the goal.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Avoids Complete Defeat</p>
<p>Jiaotong University led 3-0, and the sound of firecrackers was loud. Jiaotong University had an absolute advantage, so it took more defensive positions, and the two sides became a seesaw situation. After more than 30 minutes of fierce battle, in the last two minutes, Shen Chongdong of Jiaotong University committed a handball in the penalty area, and St. John's got a good opportunity for a penalty kick. Zhu Dehui shot and scored, pulling back a goal. When the kickoff was made in the midfield again, only a few seconds were left, and the game ended. St. John's was lucky to avoid a shutout.</p>
<p>The Cheerleaders Had Very Good Order Yesterday</p>
<p>Judging from the situation of both sides in yesterday's game, the coordination was poor. In terms of personal skills, Jiaotong University players were more skilled than St. John's. In terms of momentum, Jiaotong University was far superior to St. John's. St. John's had no fewer opportunities to attack the goal than Jiaotong University, but the shooting was too poor, and all efforts were in vain, which was due to lack of practice. The poor coordination is a common problem for university football teams, which is believed to be gradually improved. Jiaotong University's defenders are tall and strong, the goalkeeper Tai Dingxin is experienced, and the skillful dribbling of He Zeng and Liu Longxing is its advantage, but the left wing is too weak, and the goalkeeper likes to rush out to take the ball, which is not stable enough. Yesterday, the Jiaotong University cheerleaders had very good order. It is hoped that Jiaotong University will not cause disputes again due to past misunderstandings when playing against Fudan University. This is a deep expectation.</p>

<h3>Fazen Wins Over Municipal Vocational School of Physical Education</h3>
<p>In another specialist group match yesterday, Fazen College played against the Municipal Vocational School of Physical Education. The match was held at Jiaotong University at 2:30 p.m., with Chen Liangchen as the referee. Nearly a thousand spectators attended the game, and the order of the stadium was good. The two teams also fully demonstrated the spirit of sports. After the contact, the two sides were evenly matched. Until one minute before the end of the first half, Ling Yunyan of the Municipal Vocational School of Physical Education broke the net with a long shot, taking the lead with a score of 1-0. After a break, in the 15th minute, Ling Gui of Fazen was injured and left the field. Ten people played. The lineup was adjusted, and they attacked smoothly, but made no achievements. Unexpectedly, in the last five minutes, Fazen's fortune came to the heart, and Liu Tiyin and Gu Guozhang scored two goals in a row. Therefore, at the end of the game, Fazen reversed the defeat and won with a score of 2-1.</p>

<h3>Group A Football: Second Round, Donghua Wins Over Longjie Again Yesterday, 6-1, Young Players Concede Five Goals in the Second Half</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Group A football league between Donghua and Longjie, Donghua continued to maintain its winning record with a 6-1 victory over Longjie at Yiyuan at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. In the first half, Longjie defended strongly, and Donghua failed to score repeatedly, resulting in a 1-1 draw. In the second half, Longjie's defense was repeatedly broken, Donghua's offensive was great, and they scored five goals in a row. As a result, the young phoenixes were no match for the old generals, and Donghua won by a large margin of 6-1.</p>
<p>1-1 Draw</p>
<p>More than 4,000 spectators attended Yiyuan, and the situation was very grand. Jiang Yinseng executed the referee, and the whistle sounded to start the game. Longjie attacked first, but was blocked by Han Longhai. Ming Zhe lobbed the ball high to the center, and Longhai rushed up. Wu Kaimin was unprepared, and the ball went into the net. Donghua took the lead with a score of 1-0, only one minute away from the start of the game. Longjie counterattacked, and Jin Lusheng went deep alone. Bang Lun rushed out and collided with each other. The ball was saved by Bang Lun, turning danger into safety. Donghua counterattacked, and Han Longhai rushed again. Sheng Peter left his post without authorization. Fortunately, Zhao Chengfang cleared the siege. After 20 minutes, Gu Dirong was injured and left the field. Wang Lin came on as a substitute. Not long after, Longhai was also injured, but he returned to the field after a short rest. Seven minutes before the end of the first half, Long Bo committed a handball in the penalty area. Gao Xiuqing took the penalty and scored, tying the score for Longjie.</p>
<p>Scored Five Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After a break, the two teams reunited. Donghua attacked. After eight minutes, Youliang headed the ball over, and the iron leg shot the goal from fourteen yards away, scoring a goal. Donghua took the lead again with a score of 2-1. Not long after, Youliang scored another goal, making the score 3-1. At that time, Longjie still tried to cheer up, but Donghua was impeccable. After ten minutes, A Sun headed the ball, Longhai added a kick, and the ball went into Longjie's net, making the score 4-1. Longjie was frustrated and at a loss. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Lin Shaojun was planted by the referee at the twelve-yard marker. A Sun took the penalty and bounced the ball out of bounds. It was not too much. In the last six minutes, Lin Wen came on as a substitute for Chen Mingzhe. Longhai broke through three levels again, making the score 6-1.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>The Judicial Yuan Unifies the Doubt About the Concubine's Son as the Head of the Family, and the Ministry of Interior Elects the Municipal Government to Investigate the Registration of the Son Born by the Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior approved the request of the Shaanxi Provincial Government to explain the case where the wife of Tian wanted to establish the son of the concubine as the head of the family. How should the title and identity registration of this head of the family for the wife of a certain A and her biological mother be filled out? After being submitted to the Executive Yuan and transferred to the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation, it was reopened: "The unanimous interpretation of the Law Conference has been resolved by this court. If a certain A dies in a certain year, leaving a wife, a concubine, and a son born to the concubine, if there are no other relatives in the family, and both the wife and concubine recommend the son born to the concubine to be the head of the family, who has been raised by a certain A, then according to Article 1124 of the Civil Code, the son born to the concubine is the head of the family, and the wife of a certain A is the direct relative of the head of the family by marriage, and the concubine of a certain A is the mother of the head of the family," and so on. In addition, how should the household registration of the son born by the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law be handled, and it was explained that, "The son born to a certain A's daughter-in-law during the continuation of the marriage relationship with a certain A's son should be regarded as a legitimate son of a certain A's son according to Article 1063 of the Civil Code before a certain A's son files a lawsuit to deny it and obtains a final judgment. Even if this son is born by a certain A and his daughter-in-law's adultery, he cannot be recognized by a certain A. After a certain A's son files a lawsuit to deny it and obtains a final judgment, and is recognized by a certain A, he cannot be regarded as a legitimate son of a certain A according to Paragraph 1 of Article 1065 of the Civil Code," and so on. The Ministry of Interior has separately telegraphed the municipal government to investigate and ordered it to inform.</p>

<h3>The Northwest Corner of Jiangxi (One)</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Nanchang by Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>The northwest corner of Jiangxi—north of the Gan-Zhe National Highway and west of the Nanze Railway—including Anyi, Fengxin, Jing’an, Yongxiu, Wuning, Dean, Xingzi, Jiujiang, Ruichang, and the Guling area perched on the shores of Poyang Lake, was the main battlefield of the Jiangxi war zone during the war. The people of this area tasted the horrors of war and became a “disabled” zone. The reporter had a good opportunity this time to travel throughout the counties and towns, and go deep into the people, to see the real situation of the countryside after the war and the difficulties of the people's lives.</p>
<p>We crossed the broken and floating Fengchuan River pontoon bridge and stepped onto the sandy land to the north. We still saw a new Anyi market street. This was a place where the enemy drove people from the south bank during the occupation, designated as a place for "people's transactions." Now it is the only market in Anyi town, where there is still grain, groceries, and bamboo and wood businesses, maintaining the original form of a rural market. The fashion of Nanchang and Jiujiang is rarely seen here.</p>
<p>The wind and lewd operas have swept through Anyi. People's minds and times have been invaded by these bad habits. Some of the gambling games are controlled by local bullies, and some are colluding and sheltering them. If the spoils are not evenly distributed, those who deserve to die still die. The Cao Men gambling bust case is a manifestation of collusion and protection. At that time, some of the gamblers, business people, and men and women watching the opera who were caught managed to escape, while others formed an inseparable bond with the police team that caught the gamblers. The bright carbide lamps on the stage were taken down and hung on the big trees beside the road, providing light for the robbers. Gold rings and customs gold certificates were all stuffed into their pockets. With a "get out," they escaped the law. The opera goers and gamblers who had no money were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Not Even a Chicken or Duck Left at Ya Ji Long</h3>
<p>Anyi is the hometown of General Xiong Shihui. His ancestral home is Ya Ji Tang in Shiyan Township, Anyi County. When Xiong Shihui was in charge, someone suggested that Ya Ji Long be designated as a township experimental zone. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the provincial government officially renamed the original Wanbu Township as Shiyan District, and established a separate institution to carry out rural construction experiments. It was at this time that Ya Ji Long, Xiong's ancestral home, put on the cloak of a rural experiment—all the village houses were rebuilt in a new style, with farms and schools... Although it was not as good as Zhengding in Hebei, it was considered the place that "produced the chairman" in the countryside of Jiangxi. What is the experimental zone like now? Apart from finding the term "experimental township" in the archives of Anyi, you can't find a single chicken or duck on the pile of rubble in Ya Ji Long—the new countryside and new business have been completely destroyed by the enemy!</p>
<p>The county seat of Anyi is still shrouded in desolation and dilapidation. The original urban area is desolate. Apart from a county government building built by the enemy and puppets, it is difficult to find a few complete houses. People who have returned to their homes want to rebuild their old businesses, but they can't raise funds, and they can only sigh in vain!</p>
<h3>Jing’an: A Full View of a Sweet Tangerine Orchard</h3>
<p>Jing’an is a sweet tangerine orchard. Approaching the town, there is an endless red and green landscape. Going to any family, tangerines are the best treat for guests. The annual production income is tens of millions of yuan, which helps the rural economy a lot. It is a pity that the owners of the tangerine orchards do not pay much attention to replanting and cultivation. If we want to support the income of this special product in the future, we must improve it. There is a family named Shu who started by planting a tangerine orchard, and this year their income is in the millions. The joys of life are all in the tangerine orchard. The Shu family is a large clan in Jing’an. The current population of the county is 60,000, and the Shu family accounts for more than two-tenths of it. They have family rules, family laws, and ancestral instructions. People are honest and simple, and customs are good. If there are unruly people in the clan, family laws will make them obey. Not only is the Shu family educated by ancestral instructions, but it also has a moral influence in the society of Jing’an. Therefore, there are few treacherous and cunning villains in the locality, and there are not often desperate bandits. They all work happily and live in peace. This is a happy land compared to the northwest region. People from outside are mostly infatuated with the "beautiful scenery" of Jing’an. The ancestor of the Shu family was one of those who came there to start a business.</p>
<p>Superstition in gods and Buddhas is a phenomenon that is not easy to eliminate in the rural society at this stage. The people of Jing’an have been hurt by "superstitious beliefs." A family with a painful illness begged the Buddha for medicine, but as a result, they had no money to buy medicine, and the patient hanged himself. They go to ask the gods when they are sick, and they also go to ask the gods when they lack children. When the fields are dry and there are minor family matters, … everything that is considered unsatisfactory or unsolvable is sought from the gods. Therefore, "strange gods and Buddhas" are everywhere in the rural areas of Jing’an. However, given the simplicity of social facilities and county administration, what better way is there to solve the difficulties for the villagers? For example, when you are sick, you should see a doctor, but the health center does not even have a grain of quinine, and it is difficult to find a drop of red potion. If their hope is not placed on the shoulders of the "omnipotent god," who will find a solution for them?</p>

<h3>A Snapshot of Fengxin County: A Museum of Corpses</h3>
<p>When we stepped onto the large stone bridge over the Fengchuan River on the outskirts of Fengxin, we thought of the power and conspiracy of Zhang Xun, the warlord of the Beiyang government. These two stone bridges—called the Upper Bridge and the Lower Bridge by the locals—were built by Zhang Xun. The engineering was quite grand, but the bridge piers and bridge decks were damaged during the war. Now, due to financial constraints, it is impossible to restore them to their original state. Only wooden stakes and planks are used to maintain traffic on both sides of the Fengjiang River.</p>
<p>The county seat of Juxin was destroyed by the enemy, and the loss of houses reached more than 95 percent. The weeds and towering trees fully reveal its wounds. The original county government now only has a broken wall left. The urban area has become a ruin, and the newly emerging market is also on the south bank of the Fengjiang River. The local people not only believe in gods, but also pay attention to "feng shui." Stepping into the boundary of Fengxin County, in the countryside overgrown with grass and weeds, we saw countless low houses like land temples. At that time, we thought that they were the residences of people who had returned after the war, but upon closer inspection, there were no doors or windows. The four walls were sealed up. What was in the low houses was corpses. Some of them had been placed in coffins for hundreds of years, and some of them had the deceased's official titles and ages painted on the walls. After investigation, we learned that the descendants of the deceased were waiting to choose a burial site in order to beg for the prosperity of future generations. Under this kind of superstitious "feng shui," the low houses connected with tiles and eaves are museums of corpses, which makes the living feel terrible and the dead cannot be buried in peace, becoming a special snapshot in the society of Fengxin.</p>
<p>The former county magistrate of Fengxin, Wang Bangfan, first put Zhang Ren, the director of the economic and tax office who was responsible for handling the handover procedures, in jail for custody. Later, Zhang Ren was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the court for his involvement in the silver vault digging case, so no one was responsible for handling the handover. Wang Bangfan is now being dismissed and monitored by Xiong, the current magistrate, for "winter defense protection." Under this kind of stalled handover situation, some people are "exonerating" Wang Bangfan, while others are praising Xiong, the current magistrate. In Fengxin, we saw a farce of officialdom—dangerous and cunning.</p>
<h3>Local Gentry Exploitation Makes Yongxiu People Suffer</h3>
<p>During the war, the fighting between the enemy and us on both sides of the Xiujiang River made the people of Yongxiu suffer. The current county government and a street running from east to west with less than 50 empty shops fully show that the people of Yongxiu are struggling on the hunger line. There, not only are there no bookstores or newspapers, but even a slightly better piece of mao bian paper cannot be bought. The only commodity in the shops is oil, salt, and groceries. Even one rice store cannot be seen. The residents have to rush to buy rice at the "midday market," like a charge, because of hunger and poverty!</p>
<p>The power of the local gentry is quite large. The factions of Wang and Er have endless disputes. For the sake of a small official position, they may cause armed conflicts. The election of county councilors is an example.</p>
<p>The poor and helpless people in the barren land on the edge of death are not only oppressed by life, but also constantly exploited by the gentry, almost to the point of despair. The income they have earned from hard work all year round has to supply the local government's donations, apportionments, and the gentry's "invitations to wine" and "gambling," … countless kinds of "demands" and "gifts." The money from the autumn harvest is squandered under the control of these exploitations, and there is nothing left.</p>
<p>Tujia Port is the essence of Yongxiu. The Naxun Grand Iron Bridge spanning the Xiujiang River is still intact, but the shops near the railway station have been destroyed by the war and nothing is left! On the streets of Tujia Port, we can see some of the bad habits of society everywhere—prostitution, gambling, and brothels.</p>
<h3>Travelers Feel Cold on the Yongwu Road</h3>
<p>The county seat of Yongxiu is excessively eastward. The mountainous area in the western part of the county is a "turbulent land" in northern Jiangxi today. On the highway from Yongxiu to Wuning, in the valley near Baicha, there are some unemployed soldiers and scattered soldiers, hanging the official titles of adjutants and platoon leaders, forcing buying and selling, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. These "old bosses" are the source of the bandits. They not only rob passing guests—taking out their wallets and robbing goods—but sometimes even the bride's dowry is "forcibly borrowed." They even have the guts to rob and plunder, and then sit leisurely in the Baicha tavern, drinking and eating their fill, safe and sound.</p>
<p>On the eve of our arrival in Baicha, the local people spent the night in the open air to avoid the police and bandits. Even when the large team escorting us arrived in Baicha, the bandit information was still heard from the mountain behind, only one mile away. Their evil forces are not only on the mountainous Yongwu Road, but also extend to Wucheng downstream of the Xiujiang River and along the Nantao Highway. It is said that the recent car robbery cases near Zhanggongdu were the new business of these "old bosses." In terms of waterways, they force the people to pack their goods on boats and provide bodyguard-style transportation, otherwise, this road is "impassable." Especially large gangs of wood merchants have to pay homage to the "old boss," otherwise they will make you cry and laugh.</p>
<p>The number of them in this area is only a hundred or so. Fortunately, they have no political background. They are just a gang of bandits who often harass the water and land transportation lines. There are only 50 or 60 of them. Their guns are not complete, but the local armed forces of Yongxiu County have more than 200 guns. Their current strength is several times that of the bandits. Because they are scattered in four townships, they cannot be used in a concentrated manner. Some places are even being calculated by the bandits.</p>
<p>The local people said: "If you have ten thousand gold, someone will come to greet you in the dead of night." This is a true picture of the public security on the Yongwu Road.</p>
<h3>British Quakers' Friendship Organization in China: FAU in Henan</h3>
<p>Disbanded and Reorganized into a Friendship Service Team; Headquarters to Move from Zhengzhou to Shanghai; Second Day Dispatch; Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Fan Shiqin in Zhengzhou</p>
<p>There is a kind of Quaker in England who fundamentally oppose war and call themselves pacifists. When Hitler declared war on England in 1939, these British Quakers, in their religious beliefs, should oppose war, and in their national laws, should participate in war, which made them scratch their heads in difficulty. As a result, they organized a Friends Ambulance Unit (FAU), so that on the one hand, they could be worthy of God, and on the other hand, they could be worthy of the country.</p>
<p>Purpose of Work</p>
<p>As far back as when Spain and France joined forces to fight England, when the United States had not yet completely separated from England, the King of England levied military expenses from the Quakers in the United States. Those Quakers also opposed war and could not oppose the King's orders, so they paid the money, only saying that it was "dedicated to the King," but never asked how the money was used. One day, because the King of England had no gunpowder, he asked those Quakers for money. The Quakers paid the money, saying that it was for the government to buy food, which was tacitly understood.</p>
<p>The FAU existed in World War I, and 1939 was the second organization. Their purpose: to relieve people who have suffered from the scourge of war. Their work has been in Europe, the Near East, Africa, India, and all the way to China.</p>
<p>Coming to China</p>
<p>They came to China in 1941. For the first four years, they worked in the southwestern provinces. Their headquarters were initially in Lianshan, and later moved to Chongqing. The medicines imported by the FAU were quite considerable. At one point, 90 percent of the medicines used by civilians were thanks to their import. Their medical teams and surgical mobile medical teams cooperated with the Chinese Red Cross and worked in hospitals in Yunnan and the border areas of India and Myanmar, such as Lianshan and Tengchong, which had been supported by them. In the counties south of Guizhou, they treated civilians and did other relief work.</p>
<p>Going Deep into Henan</p>
<p>The FAU ended in June this year, but they are still continuing their work in China, which is not because China is still in the scourge of war. When the war ended last year, they wanted to concentrate their efforts and serve for a period of time in the most severely affected areas, so they chose to go to Henan. Their headquarters moved from Chongqing to Zhengzhou. They took over some church hospitals in Zhengzhou, Weihui, and Anyang, and helped them recover until they were able to support themselves. Several medical teams serve in various parts of Henan, mainly to deal with black fever, because this disease is particularly prevalent in Henan. Among them, 15 hospitals have added various medical equipment with their help, and opened a training class for medical engineering, with 15 students selected from various hospitals to receive training, so that they can install generators, repair telephones, and install other small equipment.</p>
<p>In the Yellow River Flood Area</p>
<p>In the Yellow River flood area of Zhongmu, a rural reconstruction plan was implemented, which was particularly meaningful. Knitting, animal husbandry, and consumer cooperatives were organized, and clinics and schools were established. The relief milk and clothing of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) were distributed by them, veterinary demonstration work was in progress, and an agricultural cultivation center was also being established. They also provided welfare assistance to the workers who repaired the Yellow River breach. The medical supplies of the International Relief Committee were also continuously transported from their staff in Chongqing. They have offices in Shanghai, Hankou, and Kaifeng. The FAU has a total of 800 people, most of whom are British. In China, there are 121: 54 British, 27 Americans, 14 Canadians, 10 New Zealanders, and 16 Chinese. In addition to those who are dispatched to work in Guangshan, Anyang, Weihui, Zhongmu, etc., there are 10 people who specialize in studying the treatment of black fever, and 12 people who are dispatched to the International Relief Committee, the China Industrial Cooperatives Association, and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) to assist in their work.</p>

<p>The source of their funding is mainly supplied by the United China Relief, as well as the American Friends Service Committee, the Canadian War Relief Fund for China, and the recent assistance from the British government. Their medicines and relief supplies are supplied by the American Red Cross and the U.S. military. Food, clothing, and mechanical equipment are allocated to them from the surplus materials of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>This time, Mrs. Cripps specially came to Zhengzhou because the FAU was here. She also went to Zhongmu once to see their work in rural reconstruction in the Yellow River flood area.</p>
<p>Promote Cooperation</p>
<p>Mr. Livling of the FAU is the chairman. He said that they were very moved by the Chinese people's forbearance and resilience in the face of difficulties and hardships. The Chinese people who work with them and those who have been in contact with them have established friendly relations with them. Although there are differences in language and customs, they believe that they can cooperate and achieve great things. They believe that their contribution to the Chinese people is too necessary, but they also feel that it is too limited, but they hope that the understanding between the people of the East and the West can promote a part of it.</p>
<p>Speaking of their difficulties, they are the same as what other people feel, that is, the traffic situation in China is too bad, and the currency is too unstable, which makes them worry about the development of hospitals and the difficulty of general budget preparation.</p>
<p>Headquarters Move Eastward</p>
<p>The FAU is a wartime organization. They have decided to conclude at the end of March next year, but a Friends Service Unit will replace it. The headquarters of the FAU will be moved from Zhengzhou to Shanghai at the beginning of this month. In the future, they will have a fairly long period of work, and the scope is not limited to Henan. The FAU will become the FSW.</p>
<p>The FAU is considered in England to be "conscientious objectors," and they can now be called "conscientious peacemakers" by others.</p>
<h3>Water Conservancy Projects in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Mao Qi</p>
<p>In the past, water conservancy in Zhejiang Province mainly focused on seawall projects, followed by farmland water conservancy. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to cooperate with the food production increase plan, it actively built farmland water conservancy projects. In the past eight years, it has been promoted in various counties in southern Zhejiang and has achieved considerable results. After the restoration, the repair of seawall projects and the construction of farmland water conservancy projects are both important and planned to be carried out at the same time. The progress of the project from January to October of this year is briefly described as follows for the reference of our fellow villagers living in Beijing and Shanghai who are concerned about the economic construction of our province:</p>
<p>Qiantang Seawall Project</p>
<p>The seawalls on the north and south banks of the Qiantang River are the barrier for the farmland and houses in the counties of western Zhejiang and the counties of Xiaoshao in eastern Zhejiang. They were in disrepair during the war, and many were collapsed, especially the Bapu area of Haining and the Wenjia Dam Chenfu Zihao were the most dangerous. The recent rush repair situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>In the 33rd and 34th years of the Republic (1944 and 1945), the Haining County Government organized a rush repair project office to rush to block the breaches near Bapu. However, due to the poor environment at that time, it was not easy to purchase materials, so only the firewood embankments were rushed to repair to defend against the tide, which was not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>After the restoration, two engineers were sent to survey along the embankment and prepare a plan for the restoration project on both sides, and drafted an estimate of 6 billion yuan for the urgently needed part and 6.3 billion yuan for the crucial part, and reported to the central government, requesting an appropriation for the project.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the central government approved the 62 million yuan for the rush repair of the seawall submitted in the 33rd year of the Republic. When the money arrived in the province, 56 million yuan was allocated to the north bank for rush repair, and on January 5th, local people were invited to discuss the organization of the Qiantang River North Bank Seawall Emergency Rush Repair Committee and Project Office to carry out the selective rush repair. Another 6 million yuan was handed over to the Xiaoshan County Government to establish the South Bank Seawall Rush Repair Project Office to carry out the rush repair of the Wenjia Dam Chenfu Zihao breach. Due to limited funds and rainy weather, the project could not be carried out. From the start of construction in February to mid-April, the north bank completed more than 4,700 cubic meters of earth filling of the stone embankment, 2,756 meters of stone facing, purchased and transported more than 18,000 pieces of wood to the construction site, and transported 1,400 bundles of wood. The south bank also only completed the embankment surface finishing project.</p>
<p>In late April, the central government approved 6 billion yuan for the urgently needed part of the project, of which 2 billion yuan was allocated by the central government, 2 billion yuan was allocated by the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch Office, and the remaining 2 billion yuan was raised locally. And first allocated 1 billion yuan, when arriving in the province, due to the approaching autumn tide, in order to complete the rush repair of all the breaches in a short period of time, it was necessary to merge and reorganize the original institutions on both sides to achieve the effect of the arm and finger. Therefore, on April 27, the heads of the provincial party, government and public opinion organs were invited to discuss and decide to organize the Zhejiang Province Seawall Project Emergency Rush Repair Committee and the Zhejiang Province Seawall Emergency Rush Repair Temporary Project Office to coordinate the handling, and to set up project offices in sections according to the original plan of the Water Conservancy Bureau to divide the three sections of Hanghai, Yanping, Shaoshao, and to carry out construction separately. From May 1st to the end of August, all the rush repair projects that were planned were completed, using a total of 24,892 wooden piles, 80,500 bundles of wood, 2,000 hemp bags, 900 cubic meters of rubble, and 2,000 bags of cement, with a total of more than 144,000 workdays, and a cost of more than 470 million yuan and 910 tons of flour.</p>
<p>On July 13, in accordance with the order of the central government, the Zhejiang Province Embankment Works Committee was established, and on August 1, the Zhejiang Province Qiantang River Seawall Project Bureau was established to continue the rush repair and repair the permanent stone embankment project. The original emergency rush repair committee and temporary project office were both closed.</p>
<p>Handling Flood Control Projects</p>
<p>The main rivers in this province have been in disrepair for many years, with silted riverbeds and collapsed embankments. In addition, excessive felling of mountain forests has lost the function of regulating rainwater. Due to the active increase in production and the cultivation of miscellaneous grains during the war to supply food for the people, there was no time to limit it. Once it rained, mountain floods often broke out and flooded into disasters. This summer, the counties along the Jinhua River and Pujiang River were flooded with fields and crops, which affected the autumn harvest. In addition to issuing a notice to all counties to strictly implement afforestation and forest protection and to limit the cultivation of terraced fields to avoid topsoil erosion and silting of the riverbed, it is also planned to carry out flood control projects during the winter slack season. The planned rivers for flood control and their required funds are listed below:</p>
<p>(Zi) The emergency flood control project of the Cao'e River has been surveyed and designed by the Water Conservancy Bureau and completed. The estimated cost of the project is more than 23.1 billion yuan and 4.94 million yuan. The surveying team is still being sent to continue detailed measurement for the design of a fundamental plan.</p>
<p>(Chou) Flood control projects for the East and West Tiaoxi Rivers and South and North Lakes have been surveyed. It is necessary to build three dams in the East Tiaoxi, one each in the South Tiaoxi and Middle Tiaoxi, and one control gate each in the South and North Lakes, and to raise and thicken their four bureau dikes. The estimated cost is 3.6 billion yuan. The Water Conservancy Bureau has set up a surveying team to go to the site for measurement.</p>

<h3>Re-discussing "Our Proposed Local System"</h3>
<p>— Kong Dachong</p>
<p>My article "Our Proposed Local System" was published in this newspaper on November 30th. However, due to space limitations, it was not exhaustive. Now, I will supplement and explain it further. When we talk about local political systems, we cannot abandon local autonomy. Local autonomy is a Western system with its consistent theories. If we do not clearly understand these theories and draft regulations accordingly, we will inevitably create a mismatch.</p>
<p>What aligns with the fundamental theories of local autonomy? We must start from the beginning. We might as well report on several points already commonly understood by Western people. These are commonplace in the West. However, judging by some local autonomy regulations enacted after the Republic of China, they might still be novel introductions in China.</p>
<p>First, what is local autonomy? A local political system does not necessarily have to be autonomous. If foreigners rule, there is a colonial local system. If the military governs, there is a military-controlled local system. If one party is in power, there is a party-led local system. In non-democratic countries, the local system is a vertical form of bureaucratic governance. The modern trend focuses only on democracy. A democratic local political system is local autonomy. "Local" is horizontal because several "locals" can exist simultaneously. It is also vertical because within one "local," there can be other "locals." What is "autonomy"? "Autonomy" is managing one's own affairs. One's own affairs are what Mr. Sun Yat-sen called "the affairs of the people." Therefore, we arrive at the definition of local autonomy: "Local autonomy" is a way for residents within a defined area to organize legal entities and manage all resident affairs within the scope of the law. If local autonomy lacked the condition "within the scope of the law," it would be a democratic country, meaning local autonomy with sovereignty.</p>
<p>Second, to implement local autonomy, units must first be defined. Every country that implements local autonomy first legally defines local units. Local units are divided into basic units and hierarchical units. For example, under a province is a county, and under a county are cities, townships, and towns. Cities, townships, and towns are basic local units because there are no other local units below them. Conversely, provinces and counties are hierarchical local units because provinces have counties and cities under them, and counties have cities, townships, and towns under them. Baojia (neighborhood watch system) is not a local unit; it is merely the cell that makes up a city, township, or town.</p>
<p>Third, the organization of local units is the local government's agencies in that locality. They are not entirely local autonomous governments. For example: (1) branches of the central government in the locality; (2) agents of the central government—the provincial government in a province and the county government in a county. Agents possess the powers of the central government. (3) representatives of the central government, representatives are responsible for handling specified matters on behalf of the central government, such as the provincial government constructing an airport within the province under the order of the central government.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called local government includes three bodies: one is the local autonomous government, the second is the body of agents of the central government, and the third is the body of representatives of the central government (and all higher-level governments). The first type qualifies as a local principal, while the second and third types qualify as representatives of the central government. In countries that have not yet implemented local autonomy, local governments at all levels only possess the qualifications of representatives of the central government. In other words, they are branches of the central government.</p>
<p>Fourth, what does a local autonomous government do? A local autonomous government should manage all matters concerning the residents. All political, economic, and cultural matters related to the lives of residents in the locality can be managed by the local autonomous government. This is its business, or function, or power. In administrative terms, it is local autonomous administration. Opposite to local autonomous administration is national administration, which is the management of matters concerning all the people by the central government and its agents. When both sides manage the same things, a division naturally occurs. In countries ruled by law, national administration and local autonomous administration are clearly separated.</p>
<p>From this, we also know that the popular "local administration" actually includes three items: (1) the administration of agents of the central government (i.e., a part of national administration in the locality); (2) the administration of representatives of the central government (and all higher-level governments) (also a part of national administration in the locality); (3) local autonomous administration (referred to as autonomous administration). After local autonomous administration is assigned to the local autonomous government, if there are hierarchical units in the local autonomous government, a reasonable distribution should be made through legislative procedures. However, one principle is that hierarchical units should be assigned fewer tasks, while basic units should be assigned more. The reason is simple: basic units have a direct and close relationship with the residents. Since the purpose of an autonomous organization is to manage all matters concerning the residents, it is most practical and effective to have the autonomous organization closest to the residents manage it.</p>
<p>Fifth, administrative orders and autonomous supervision. The identities of provinces and counties are different from those of cities, townships, and towns. Provinces and counties are both agents and representatives of the central government, and autonomous organizations. The authority of this agency includes supervising lower-level local autonomy. Cities, townships, and towns are both agents and representatives of the central government and autonomous organizations. The authority of this agency does not include supervising lower-level local autonomy. The central government can use administrative orders to direct provincial and municipal governments, but the target of the order is the agent or representative of the central government. The provincial government can use administrative orders to direct county and municipal governments, and the target is also the agent of the central government. The same applies to counties and townships. However, a provincial government with the nature of an autonomous organization has no subordinate relationship with county and municipal governments and, of course, has no right to direct them. A county government with the nature of an autonomous organization has no right to direct the affairs of township offices. Therefore, provincial, municipal, and county governments and township offices with the nature of autonomous organizations are not directed by anyone but are only supervised by the central government or its agents. Autonomous organizations are directly responsible to the residents.</p>
<p>Sixth, after the budgets, national tax sources, and autonomous tax sources of local governments are divided, the national tax sources are levied and used by the central government, and the autonomous tax sources are levied and used by the local autonomous governments. The budget of provincial local governments must be divided into two types: (1) the central government's agency and representative departments, which are a part of the national budget and have nothing to do with local residents; (2) the autonomous departments, which collect autonomous taxes and use them for local autonomous administration. Higher-level supervisory bodies only have the right to approve. As for how to collect and spend, how to use, and how to audit the final accounts, it is all the affair of the autonomous organization itself, and higher-level supervisory bodies do not need to interfere.</p>
<p>Seventh, centralism and decentralization. From the above analysis, from the perspective of local autonomy, we can determine the meaning of centralism and decentralization: (1) Centralism: A, many national administrative matters; B, fewer local autonomous administrative heads and local autonomous legislators are elected; C, strong supervision of local autonomy or even intervention; D, many national tax sources. (2) Decentralization: A, many local autonomous administrative matters; B, more local autonomous administrative heads and local autonomous legislators are elected; C, weak supervision of local autonomy; D, many autonomous tax sources.</p>
<p>Eighth, what happens when the central government and local autonomous governments dispute power? Regarding this point, in the United Kingdom and the United States, it is a matter for ordinary courts. In continental countries and other countries ruled by law, it is mostly resolved by administrative courts. Higher-level supervisory bodies cannot make decisions on such disputes by order because they are the central government. How can the central government arbitrate disputes in which it is a party?</p>
<p>Ninth, what governing powers do local autonomous governments have? They have: (1) executive power; (2) legislative power; (3) judicial power. However, judicial power only exists under the local autonomy system in the United States. The continental system and the systems of other countries in the world do not allow judicial power within the scope of local autonomy.</p>
<p>Tenth, how do local autonomous governments coordinate and exercise executive and legislative powers? In general, there are three types: (1) separation of executive and legislative institutions; (2) a mixed executive and legislative system; (3) the manager system.</p>
<p>Eleventh, what is the head of a local autonomous government? This certainly varies from country to country. In summary, it is nothing more than: (1) the head of the executive body; (2) the head of the executive body and the head of the legislative body; (3) the head of a mixed executive and legislative body; (4) a head standing side by side with other executive heads—such as some cities in the United States; (5) (no head)—such as counties in the United States.</p>
<p>Twelfth, what is the council of a local autonomous government? In summary, it is nothing more than: (1) of a legislative nature; (2) of a legislative and executive nature; (3) of an advisory nature (its resolutions are not binding on the executive body).</p>
<p>Thirteenth, the relationship between central and autonomous institutions. After the provincial, municipal, county governments and township offices are separated into two institutions—the heads have dual identities. In the capacity of agents and representatives of the central government, they are representatives of the central government, accept the command of the central government, use the funds of the central government, and are absolutely responsible to the central government. In addition, they represent the central government in supervising lower-level local autonomy (except for cities, townships, and towns).</p>
<p>But in the autonomous institution, they are public servants of the locality, complying with the resolutions of the autonomous institution, using autonomous funds, and being supervised by higher-level institutions, absolutely responsible to the voters.</p>
<p>The above thirteen points are the basic theories of local autonomy. Based on these basic theories, let's look at our local system:</p>
<p>First, Units. (1) Province—Whether a province is a local unit is, in fact, in flux. (2) City (city under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and city under the jurisdiction of the province)—In fact, it is recognized as an independent local unit. (3) Administrative Inspectorate District—In fact, it is not recognized as a local unit, but it is not explicitly stipulated as an agent of the central government (and province). (4) County—Confirmed as a local unit. (5) District—Whether it is a local unit is unclear. (6) Township—Not fully recognized as a local unit. (7) Bao (neighborhood)—Seems to be recognized as a local unit.</p>
<p>Second, Organization. According to the current situation, the institutions that handle national administration and the autonomous organizations that handle local autonomous administration are not divided. Lower-level governments blindly accept unlimited supervision from higher-level governments. In fact, supervisory power and command power are inseparable. Lower-level governments do whatever the upper level orders. Moreover, the heads of the executive bodies are consistently appointed. Although there are councils at all levels and bao citizens' assemblies, they are, in fact, of an advisory nature. Third, Business. National administration and local autonomous administration have never been divided. Because they have not been divided, the central government seems to manage everything that provinces, cities, counties, townships, and towns can also manage. In fact, the central government seizes power from the provinces and cities. Whenever there is a profit to be made or something easy to handle, the central government often seizes it from the provinces and cities. Provinces are helpless against the central government and, in turn, seize what counties and cities under provincial jurisdiction manage. Finally, it reaches the townships. Townships are units that are exploited at every level. Therefore, townships have no local autonomous administrative matters to handle. In fact, all they handle are national administrative matters that the county government cannot handle, such as urging the collection of grain and raising national debt. Provinces, cities, counties, townships, and towns have never had strict and accurate budgets. Occasionally, there are some that are mostly drafted by higher-level governments. The use of the budget almost entirely depends on the orders of higher-level governments.</p>
<p>Regarding tax sources, the previously divided two-level system was not strictly implemented. The currently divided three-level system also places the tax burden heavily on the central government.</p>
<p>From the above three points, we can draw a conclusion about the current Chinese local political system. The current Chinese local system is, in fact, not autonomous but is an extremely centralized bureaucratic governance. However, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on the draft constitution place the focus on the province and stipulate that the provincial governor be elected. This view tends toward extreme local decentralization. If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are followed, China will inevitably have a central government like that of the Spring and Autumn period and the distorted states of America in a few years. Implementing this system in China is truly dangerous. Not leaning toward centralism nor leaning toward decentralization is truly "Our Proposed Local System."</p>

<h3>Nationals and National Products</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>The editors of this publication once used "Using National Products is Most Glorious" as a slogan to awaken national awareness. Purchasing and using national products is a glorious act of patriotism. To ensure that domestic industries stand firm, that the country does not become a consumer market for foreign countries, and that the blood and sweat of the people are not absorbed and devoured by the great powers, we must, as a principle, purchase and use national products. With what I know, I will briefly elaborate on this.</p>
<p>Reviewing the statistics of import and export goods for the past six months, we cannot help but shudder. Foreign goods are pouring in like a tide, while export goods are as rare as phoenix feathers. The numbers in the deficit are truly staggering! Previously, what we considered the most reliable capital for competing in foreign markets, such as tung oil, tea, and silk, is now unprofitable due to high costs, leading to hesitation and an inability to obtain foreign exchange. If this continues, what can we do except borrow to fill the imbalance of imports and exports? From the perspective of domestic industries, due to domestic political instability, the inability to restore transportation, soaring prices, and excessive imports, products cannot be exported, resulting in most factories being on the verge of unsustainable difficulties. In addition, the Chinese people wholeheartedly worship foreign goods, considering using foreign goods to be fashionable and noble, causing valuable foreign exchange to be wasted in vain, and striking a blow to domestic industries, whose sales are bleak. The most serious consequence is the total collapse of domestic industries and the total collapse of the national economy.</p>
<p>In fact, although foreign goods have the merits of being cheap and of good quality, many are not as good as their reputation. The main reason they are popular is the foreign brand labeled "USA" or "British Made." Moreover, the foreign goods that flood the market are mostly unnecessary items such as decorations, entertainment products, and food products, which are most attractive, leading people to extravagance and waste without realizing it, and further generating a psychology of despising and looking down on national products. Although the prices of national products are extremely low and suitable for the economic capabilities of ordinary people, they are gradually becoming unwanted. Originally, the target market for national products was the cities and vast rural areas. If we can grasp this only large market that can absorb national products, then national products will naturally sell well, and domestic industries will naturally prosper. However, at present, the rehabilitation has not been completed, and transportation is obstructed. National products that are produced from factories can only be sold locally to temporarily maintain them until the environment improves and they can be expanded. Take Shanghai as an example. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country, with the highest density, the largest quantity, and the most types. At present, most of this industry also uses Shanghai as a consumer market. However, Shanghai is also the main port for foreign ships to unload goods, and Shanghai citizens are also the first to become the targets of foreign goods sales. In this way, if foreign goods want to seize the Shanghai market, coupled with the citizens' psychology of worshiping foreign goods, the fragile domestic industry will be placed in a position of being on its last breath and having no foothold.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Association once launched a campaign to use national products, calling on the people to purchase and use national products as much as possible under the premise of not violating economic principles, in order to correct the psychology of extravagance, fashion, and arrogance, to encourage domestic industries in spirit, and to give domestic industries the vitality to continue and overcome serious crises in substance, so that they can sprout and grow after the environment improves. This is worthy of deep reflection by patriotic people!</p>
<p>I remember that when I first arrived in Shanghai, I heard a citizen say something that was absolutely true. That is, before the victory, Japanese expatriates lived mostly in Hongkou, where they had their stores selling Japanese goods shipped from Japan. At that time, the Japanese housewives living in the former French Concession area often took a soy sauce bottle in the morning, took the tram to Hongkou to buy domestic soy sauce. It is said that they did not do it because there were no soy sauce shops near their homes or because Chinese soy sauce was not good and did not suit their taste, but because they believed that if domestic goods were available, they should buy domestic goods first. This is a very small thing, but it is very meaningful and valuable. This spirit is worthy of our emulation.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Industrial Rationalization</h3>
<p>— Shao Qiu</p>
<p>Industrial rationalization is "scientific management." The United States, an advanced industrial country, noticed this early. In 1920, the American Industrial Association initiated a joint public-private "Waste Elimination Movement," specifically conducting detailed surveys on six major industries: clothing, printing, construction, textiles, shoemaking, and metals. The purpose of the survey was to save on some of the waste that occurred in the incomplete industrial organizations (i.e., current industrial organizations are prone to speculation and overproduction), labor mobility, labor-management conflicts, interruptions in fuel and power supply, seasonal changes in the supply and demand of goods and production, the lack of standardization of product sizes, and production processes and raw material handling.</p>
<p>According to the published survey reports, the proportion of waste that can be eliminated is 64% for the clothing industry, 58% for the printing industry, 53% for the construction industry, 49% for the textile industry, 41% for the shoemaking industry, and 29% for the metal industry, with an average of 49% for all American industries.</p>
<p>As for the Waste Elimination Movement, it was implemented in an organized manner based on the eleven guidelines determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The eleven guidelines are described below:</p>
<p>1. Eliminate waste in railway transportation, and actively seek policies to utilize appropriate equipment and better methods.</p>
<p>2. In order to economically transport large quantities of scattered goods, the transportation links between inland rivers must be greatly improved.</p>
<p>3. Implement nationwide electrification to achieve great savings in fuel, power, and labor.</p>
<p>4. Efforts should be made to alleviate the seasonal unemployment caused by the economic cycle and find appropriate means and methods.</p>
<p>5. The government's statistical work must be improved, and statistics on production, sales, inventory, and prices should be collected both domestically and abroad in order to eliminate commercial risks and suppress speculative buying and selling based on reckless predictions.</p>
<p>6. The need for and supply of labor in construction projects, the coal mining industry, and other industries change significantly due to seasonal prosperity and idleness, and efforts should be made to reduce this.</p>
<p>7. Standardize the formats, sizes, and shapes of commodities to eliminate waste in manufacturing and sales. At the same time, manufacturing methods, freight bills, bills of lading, etc. should be changed to a fixed format.</p>
<p>8. In order to discover labor savings and more advanced manufacturing and sales methods, scientific research institutions for industrial economics should be developed.</p>
<p>9. In order to reduce the waste associated with the sale of agricultural products, implement a joint sales method and improve the equipment of agricultural product loading and unloading docks.</p>
<p>10. In order to save litigation costs, a commercial arbitration system should be developed.</p>
<p>11. Labor-management coordination should be used to eliminate the waste caused by disputes between the two parties.</p>
<p>After the Industrial Rationalization Movement was launched, the United States implemented it most vigorously. From the perspective of the comprehensive progress of production capacity of the entire American industry, it had increased to 98.2% in 1938 and to 110.9% in 1940.</p>
<h3>Water Gate Used in a Canadian Paper Mill</h3>
<p>It is said that there are many water gates like this in the Quebec area. On the one hand, it adjusts the water level and transports the wood used for paper making to the workshop, and on the other hand, it can also be used as motive power. (Photo taken and sent by the New York Times)</p>

<h3>Factory Health Facilities</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>
<p>The health of workers is directly related to productivity, so health facilities in factories cannot be ignored. The statistics of health facilities in 1,237 factories in New Jersey, which were investigated by the U.S. Industrial Health Office last year, are translated and excerpted below for the reference of the industry.</p>
<p>These 1,000+ factories have a total of 674,106 workers. Among them, the steel, chemical, and machinery industries are the largest in scale, and the transportation, electrical, and chemical industries employ the most workers. Factories with more than 1,000 employees account for one-tenth of the total, and factories with less than 250 employees account for two-thirds. The ratio of the total number of male and female workers is about two to one (two male workers to one female worker).</p>
<p>(1) Factory Doctors—176 factories, accounting for 14% of the total, have doctors who are stationed in the factory or come to the factory for several hours of consultation every day.</p>
<p>(2) Nurses—There are 364 factories that employ nurses, accounting for 30% of the total.</p>
<p>Large and large-scale factories employ doctors and nurses, while small factories do not have these facilities. Therefore, the number of workers who can receive free medical care accounts for 60% to 80% of the total. Among the total of 977 nurses in the factories, about 80% are graduates of formal nursing schools, and the rest are mostly non-graduates who only work as nurses.</p>
<p>(3) Physical Examination—About one-third of the factories (35%) have all workers undergo physical examinations, one-eighth of the factories have some workers undergo examinations, and most of the others do not conduct physical examinations.</p>
<p>(4) Pharmacies—Factories with one or more rooms used as pharmacies account for two-thirds of the total.</p>
<h3>The Unemployed in the United States</h3>
<p>— Fei Jiao</p>
<p>Six Million People Receive Government Subsidies</p>
<p>The unemployment situation in the United States has become a mystery due to the contradictory figures released. The contradictory figures are—</p>
<p>According to estimates by the "Bureau of the Census," there were 2.71 million people in the country looking for jobs in February of this year. This estimate is based on a survey of 25,000 households.</p>
<p>Other government agencies reported that during the same period, a total of 3.5 million people across the country received unemployment subsidies because they did not have suitable jobs, of which 1.281 million were veterans.</p>
<p>The difference between these two statistics is 800,000. Taking other factors into account, the actual difference may be even greater. Therefore, the unemployment situation in the United States is roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Of the veterans who have recently retired, 2 million have not yet entered the "labor market." Some of them are choosing a career, some are on vacation, and some are vacationing. If these 2 million people are added to the previous 3.5 million people, then the number of people in the United States receiving unemployment benefits will total 5.5 million.</p>
<p>Only three out of about five unemployed workers in the United States are eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Others are not eligible for benefits because they have worked for too few years or for other reasons. Some workers will have their benefits canceled next year. In this way, the actual number of unemployed will increase by another 500,000 compared to the existing statistics.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the total number of unemployed workers in the United States is currently 6 million.</p>

<p>Regarding the length of service between male and female workers, statistics in the United States show that the longest period a male worker stays in a factory is twenty to thirty years, while for female workers, the longest is five to eight years. This is because some female workers are unwilling to continue working after marriage. From this perspective, it seems female workers are inferior to male workers. However, in fact, female workers also have their advantages. A male worker often likes to change his occupation, sometimes several times a year. A female worker, on the other hand, can steadily work for three to four years. Therefore, employing female workers also has its benefits, although it requires a longer training period.</p>
<p>(2) Overtime and Night Work</p>
<p>In many factories, due to the heavy workload, daytime workers cannot cope. Therefore, there are two solutions: one is for daytime workers to work overtime at night, and the other is to hire another group of workers to do night work. However, most workers prefer daytime work. If it were not for income reasons, they would not be willing to work at night. If there are two shifts of workers in a factory, many workers would hope to work during the day. But from the perspective of a manufacturer, if the goods produced are indeed needed in the market, then using both day and night shifts is more cost-effective. Usually, wages for night work are higher than those for day work, but the expected output for night work can be less than that for day work because working at night is not as easy as during the day. Also, due to the negligence of supervision, many damaged goods are often produced at night. Therefore, to avoid damage and improve work efficiency, there should be perfect supervision methods during night work.</p>
<p>(3) Workers' Interest in the Enterprise</p>
<p>In the past, employing workers was solely based on the perspective of the enterprise organization, without considering the interests of the workers. Now, the focus should shift, and the welfare of the workers should also be taken into account. In an enterprise organization, whether one is a shareholder, director, staff member, or worker, everyone hopes that the management can operate effectively and generate profits. After profits are obtained, they hope that these profits can be distributed to everyone, and workers should also enjoy a portion of these profits. When workers receive these benefits, they will naturally develop an interest in the factory they serve and work hard. This method has always been practiced in Chinese enterprises, but the only question is the amount of distribution.</p>
<p>Another method is to solicit workers' opinions so that they can also contribute to improvements in the manufacturing process. In general, a committee can be established, such as a welfare committee, with funding from a portion of each worker's monthly salary as membership fees, and additional funds allocated by the enterprise organization to enrich the funds. In addition to handling various welfare activities, this committee can also accept workers' suggestions for work improvement. After receiving the suggestions, they should be carefully considered, and if they can be implemented and proven successful, the workers should be given appropriate compensation. This can make them develop an interest in the enterprise organization. The closer the relationship and the stronger the emotional ties between workers and the enterprise organization, the more work efficiency can be improved. This kind of psychological construction should be considered.</p>

<h3>Facing the Rainy Season—Notes from a Trip to Yunnan—Part 1</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>Due to the introduction of a fellow traveler, and due to the beautiful name—Cui Lake's enchanting allure; upon arriving here, I first chose a temporary residence in a small lakeside hotel—the Cui Lake Hotel. Wanting to admire more of the lake's objects and borrowing the lake's beautiful ambiance and verdant color to cleanse the dust of the journey—mostly spiritual; I rented a room on the third floor that could overlook two directions. "Look!" When, driven by a kind of insatiable and even more curious desire, I hurriedly opened all the windows; I couldn't help but shout like this, often shouting like this.</p>
<p>Outside the window, along the long street, along the road paved purely with stone slabs—East Cui Lake Road. Across the road is the Cui Lake's verdant lawn; the Cui Lake's deep green water; the Cui Lake's soft green weeping willows draped on both sides of the road; and each pavilion and islet that mutually reflect these hues of green; bridge arches and bay embankments are all displayed before your eyes, looming before your eyes.</p>
<p>Because it is the normal rainy season—summer here is called the rainy season, and winter is called the windy season—so I often admire the rainy scenery on the lake. Often, on a clear sunny day, suddenly from an unknown wisp of cloud, a long stream of rain pours down. The dazzling sunlight, however, shines like a mirror from all around. The even rain threads clearly slant towards the ground. Even from an unknown place in the sky, a team of small wind musicians is summoned, cheerfully blowing the clouds away; shifting the rain's vault, and the clouds gradually turn black, forming a large mass, like a black curtain, like a black mountain range with many trees. The rain falls in a fluttering, playful, sometimes urgent, sometimes intermittent manner.</p>
<p>Pedestrians are often ambushed by the rain. When you occasionally feel a gust of wind blowing and many pedestrians are running hurriedly, you know that the rain is coming. Similarly, every running person will naturally shout with passion: "The rain is coming! The rain is coming!" But the swift raindrops have already fallen without hesitation like shooting stars on their hair, foreheads, and rain-soaked clothes. But sometimes, when they run to their door, to a place to shelter from the rain, panting and congratulating themselves on avoiding the rain, the cloud formation in the sky has just dissipated and disappeared. The hot sun shines again on the earth. They busily wipe away the raindrops and then wipe away the sweat.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a thin cloud, with the assistance of a bustling wind group, immediately spreads into a sky-covering haze, and passionate rain falls; affectionate rain; large-scale rain, almost like rain at night, causes the ground to converge into countless rivers and swamps, isolating the countryside from the city.</p>
<p>Especially on moonlit nights, under the pure, bright moonlight, a large strand of clear, silvery rain money often hangs down. Like a sparse curtain, like rows of slender willow branches in the misty spring morning, hiding garden pavilions and terraces, the difference being that there is also the sound of rustling and gurgling, often giving those who enjoy the rain on moonlit nights endless and wonderful imaginations.</p>
<p>The summer here is so lovely, so lively, and so changeable! "Have you ever been here? Have you ever been greeted by the coolness of the hot summer here?"</p>
<h3>Midday Meal</h3>
<p>— Geng Yu</p>
<p>One autumn afternoon, two guests came to Mei Fang's house: one was her aunt, and the other was her aunt's daughter, Hui Fang. They were wearing makeup and dressed fashionably. The cousins, who usually didn't interact much, initially looked at each other, but then, following the conversation between their mothers and aunts, they somehow started talking about small things. Then, they shook hands, put their arms around each other's shoulders, and looked and played outside together, becoming very intimate. Mei Fang even led them to visit a nearby small school, becoming as close as could be.</p>
<p>"The school there has bigger school buildings, and the classrooms aren't as comfortable as ours!" Hui Fang said when they returned from the school.</p>
<p>"Well, do you have a playground?"</p>
<p>"We don't need a playground."</p>
<p>They both boasted about how good their own schools were, but neither of them had thought that there was a more beautiful place than their own schools. The aunt wanted to discuss her daughter's admission problem with her brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Brother-in-law! Mei Fang's father was a teacher. In ordinary times, "scholars are useless," and no matter how noble a teacher's character or how profound his learning, it was still not easy for him to be respected. Now, perhaps it was the turning of the tide. Although teachers continue to endure painful lives, they are gradually being respected in spirit. "Isn't that so? Most schools are very crowded this semester. Hui Fang hasn't chosen a school yet..." Hui Fang's mother ran excitedly to her sister's house.</p>
<p>When it was time for lunch, the brother-in-law returned from a nearby school. Hearing that his niece wanted to enroll, he readily agreed to find a way to arrange it for her. At the same time, because it was inconvenient to go back and forth, she wanted to have lunch at the school. In principle, this midday meal should be eaten at her sister's house, but it wasn't just for a day or two. Hui Fang's mother was embarrassed to bring it up, but finally talked about this issue.</p>
<p>"There are people who have lunch at the school, but the food is really bland. I'm afraid she won't be used to it," the sister said frankly, thinking of the facts.</p>
<p>"Then, can she eat with her uncle? We'll pay for the meal at the same rate as the school. Fortunately, it's just one more person, Hui Fang," Hui Fang's mother thought that her brother-in-law could agree.</p>
<p>"No, it's not a matter of money. To be honest, we don't have servants here, and we're really too busy. Sometimes when it's windy or raining, no one goes to the market to buy fresh vegetables. We rely on some dried vegetables at mealtimes. How can a child eat that?" The brother-in-law knew Hui Fang's family's living situation and was afraid that he wouldn't have good things for Hui Fang to eat, making others laugh.</p>
<p>"..." Hui Fang's mother didn't expect that her words would be rejected and was speechless for a moment. Her mouth was a little dazed. She thought to herself: "It's really hard to figure out the psychology of scholars. They always talk in a hesitant way!"</p>
<p>The brother-in-law knew that Hui Fang's mother was angry and thought: "Since we are relatives, if I refuse outright, the neighbors may gossip." So he said to Hui Fang's mother: "Let's do this. It's hot now, so she can eat at our house. When the weather cools down, we'll think of another way."</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll pay for the meals in the same way." After the matter was discussed and a result was reached, Hui Fang's mother thought on the way home: "Respect teachers, respect teachers! We've all become as proud as upstarts because of the teachers. It turns out they're still so poor!"</p>
<p>The next day, Mei Fang's mother went to the market to buy groceries, and Hui Fang started having lunch at her uncle's house. It was the first meal that she was paying for. Hui Fang looked around the table and felt that the dishes were simpler than yesterday's. Naturally, yesterday was a guest meal, and today it was a home-style meal. However, although it was a home-style meal, after Hui Fang joined, this home-style meal was different from usual.</p>
<p>The uncle thought: "Even if it's a home-style meal, I should teach the children the rules of eating." He sat at the head of the table, his wife sat on the left, Mei Fang was older and sat on the right, and he asked Hui Fang to sit at the foot of the table. Hui Fang saw that her uncle's attitude was different from yesterday's. She thought: "I'm paying for the meal. Could it be that my cousin is my uncle's biological daughter?" She got angry.</p>
<p>The dishes were two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup. The soup was in the middle, and the two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes were diagonally opposite each other, arranged very evenly. The yellow croaker was considered the best dish. Before her uncle could pick up his chopsticks, Hui Fang had already set her sights on it. She raised her small hand and reached far to eat the yellow croaker exclusively, as if she wanted to stuff it all into her stomach in one bite. The uncle never advocated that children move the dishes they like to eat and was embarrassed to speak out, he just looked at her, glaring at her, but Hui Fang didn't care. "We're paying for it," she thought.</p>
<p>On the third day, the aunt didn't go to the market because there were still some of the two yellow croakers she had bought yesterday, mixed with some garden vegetables, which was enough to make up the dishes on the table. However, Hui Fang's taste buds were very sensitive. As soon as she tasted it, she felt that the yellow croaker wasn't freshly cooked. She whispered in Mei Fang's ear, but Mei Fang couldn't hear it, so she didn't say anything. The aunt understood what she meant, but there was nothing she could do. Because the dishes didn't suit her taste, Hui Fang ate one less bowl of rice. The uncle said: "Eating shouldn't be too much or too little. Having a fixed amount for each meal is a good hygienic habit." She didn't understand what her uncle meant and thought that her uncle was saying that she ate too much. "We're paying for it," she thought.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Mei Fang followed Hui Fang to her aunt's house to play. The aunt said: "Mei Fang! Good! Come eat a meal at our house. Although we're poor, we don't care about eating more or less." Mei Fang didn't understand what her aunt meant, but she understood that there seemed to be a hidden barb in her words.</p>
<p>"Mei Fang! When you eat, you give the stinky yellow croaker to the guests and ask them to sit at the end of the table. After all, you scholars pay attention to etiquette!" The aunt thought that Mei Fang didn't understand, so she simply revealed it plainly.</p>
<p>Mei Fang didn't know how to answer, so she let her aunt say it herself. After finishing dinner, she bid farewell to her aunt and returned home. As soon as she got home, she told her mother what her aunt had said. Her mother was also angry, but because they were close relatives, she didn't express it and let Mei Fang say it herself.</p>
<p>Saturday evening was the uncle's leisure time. As soon as he heard these words, his pleasant face immediately turned serious.</p>
<p>"Mei Fang! Who told you to go to their house?" Mei Fang didn't answer. The uncle paced back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, Mei Fang's mother went to the market again to prepare her niece's midday meal. Her idea was that face was the most important thing. Since her younger sister had this kind of thinking, she had to endure as much as possible so that they wouldn't laugh at her. That noon, the dishes had been arranged comfortably. Mei Fang's mother brought up a dish of preserved grapes that her uncle liked to eat and then shrank back. The uncle said:</p>
<p>"Preserved grapes? Very good, why are you taking them back?"</p>
<p>"If Hui Fang sees them, won't she say they're stinky again?" Mei Fang's mother said.</p>
<p>"What are you afraid of! In wealth, act according to wealth; in poverty, act according to poverty. If you want to eat good things, go to a restaurant every day!" The uncle seemed to have some complaints.</p>
<p>"Aren't the dishes good today?" Mei Fang also interjected.</p>
<p>"Children shouldn't talk too much. We eat fish and meat, and you also eat fish and meat; we chew on vegetable roots, and you also chew on vegetable roots. What's the point of carrying words back and forth and stirring up trouble?" The uncle interrupted Mei Fang's words and stared at her fiercely. Hui Fang also stole a glance at her uncle, feeling the majesty of her uncle's eyes. She wanted to speak, but was a little afraid, and finally finished the meal in silence. As she was leaving, she said softly to her aunt:</p>
<p>"Mom said that we can afford a maid. Starting tomorrow, we'll have the maid deliver meals to eat every day. I won't come here to eat anymore." After speaking, she ran to school. Mei Fang's mother felt relieved and also felt an nameless pain.</p>
<p>One Friday a month later was the anniversary of the grandmother's death. Because the grandmother had no sons, the sacrificial rites were all handled by her daughters. That day, Mei Fang's mother enshrined the grandmother's portrait. After she and Hui Fang bowed, she also went to school to call Hui Fang. Hui Fang didn't know what was happening and ran over excitedly. When she saw the grandmother's picture, she stared blankly. She thought:</p>
<p>"This kind and amiable old lady is my grandmother! Why is Mei Fang's house also enshrining her?"</p>
<p>"Hui Fang! You should pay your respects to your grandmother! It turns out that you and Mei Fang have the same grandmother!" Mei Fang's mother explained.</p>
<p>After Hui Fang stood at attention and bowed to her grandmother's portrait, she retreated step by step, wanting to return to school.</p>
<p>"Hui Fang! You should have lunch here today!"</p>
<p>Hui Fang looked at her grandmother's portrait, her legs naturally stopped, and her eyes also unconsciously became wet.</p>
<h3>Child</h3>
<p>— Fang Dike</p>
<p>Fang Dike (Van Dyck 1599—1641) was a student of Rubens. At the age of thirty, he was hired by the British government as a court painter, creating many portraits and can be called an excellent painter of Flanders. The style is gentle and simple, which can also be seen in this simple quick sketch. (Lion)</p>
<h3>On "Metaphor" from an Aesthetic Point of View</h3>
<p>— Shusun Ru</p>
<p>Mr. Zang Kejia, in his article "Metaphor in Literary Works," cited many vivid and interesting examples, illustrating the importance of metaphor in literary works. This article is certainly not only, as Mr. Zang said, "a little useful" for those who "call butterflies sisters and greet the moon as an older sister, degrading the value of metaphor too much." For young people engaged in literary creation, it is indeed a compass.</p>
<p>Metaphor, in rhetoric and in the technique of literary creation, does have its important place, but from the aesthetic point of view, "metaphor" is an ambiguously meaningful term. The general understanding of metaphor only extends to the experiential and common-sense meanings, failing to analyze and study it theoretically and scientifically.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Let's look at the examples cited by Mr. Zang: "Hands like tender scallions, skin like condensed fat" is a metaphor, which uses one thing to express another thing; "As if someone owes you two hundred coins" is a metaphor, which uses a fact to express an expression; "Using the thumb and forefinger of the left and right hands to make a circle" is a metaphor, which uses a hand gesture to express something in the mind. Regardless of what these examples use to express what, they all use something that is commonly known to express a specific thing seen in someone's mind (an image in the mind produced by intuition).</p>
<p>Everyone has his own life history and personality, so he will inevitably have different mental images for the same thing. For example, for the common intuition of time, to you it is "time flies like an arrow," to him it is "time flies like a white colt passing through a crack," and to another person who is often alone, it is "days are like years."</p>
<p>Metaphor is the expression of mental images, which is the expression of intuition.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Why use metaphor?</p>
<p>It is to have a clearer intuition and mental image (that is, expression), especially to make one's intuition and mental image infect others (that is, communication).</p>
<p>And the purpose of literary works is to express and communicate. Therefore, the task of metaphor is also the task of literary creation. Metaphor is literary creation. To talk about metaphor is to talk about the basic principles of literary creation, that is, to talk about the entirety of literary creation.</p>
<p>The play "Sunrise" (by Cao Yu) is a literary work and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the dark side of urban life. The poem "The Black Hand of Sin" (by Zang Kejia) is a literary work and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the true face of corrupt religion. In terms of extension, the greatness of metaphor can reach this extent.</p>
<p>"Flower" is a single word and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes an organ of a plant. "Pain" is a noun and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes a special feeling that a living thing has due to a certain stimulus. "Just like a river of spring water flowing eastward" is a sentence and also a metaphor. It metaphorically describes the nature and quantity of an emotion. In terms of extension, the smallness of metaphor can reach this extent.</p>
<p>In terms of extension, literary works and metaphor naturally cannot be the same, but in terms of connotation, literary works are metaphor, and metaphor is literary works. There can be no difference between the two.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Metaphor can also be replaced by "imagery." To express something with imagery is to express it with metaphor. "Have you seen how those who catch chickens at night grab the chicken by the feet? They are caught like that." This is an image-based technique and also a metaphor technique. Metaphor can also be replaced by "typicality." Ah Q is a typical character and also cannot not be a metaphor. He metaphorically describes the entirety of Chinese people who are similar to this type.</p>
<p>Metaphor, imagery, typicality—this series of commonly used terms in literary theory are just one-sided views of literary works. From a certain aspect, a literary work is a metaphor, is imagery, is typicality, but from the whole, it is nothing more than expression and communication.</p>
<p>It is not useless to study the one-sided nature of literary works, but if one is limited to this one-sided study, one will inevitably fall into error. The blind men "feeling the plate and examining the candle" are mistaken in their one-sided observations. Therefore, when we study the aspect of "metaphor," we must not neglect the study of the whole, and we must not neglect the most basic "expression" and "communication."</p>
<h3>A Drop of Blood for Every Inch of Our Land 117</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>He Jian bowed three times, performing the ritual, and then, according to Japanese custom, offered a few words of greeting before accepting the book. He held it in his hands, and it turned out that what Jinshu had just recited at length was precisely Volume Six of the "National Language," where Duke Huan of Qi and Guan Zhong discussed their plans for invading the south, attacking the north, conquering the east, and pacifying the west. The "boom ji jiao" and so on were simply "Duke Huan said," and so on. Why did he choose this particular passage to recite? The intention was likely to tell the elder statesmen that their current all-out invasion, their preparation to conquer the world, was based on the aggressive policies of Duke Huan of Qi, one of the "Five Hegemons," as recorded in the classics. Now that Pingzi had not been captured, he could only let He Jian relay the message.</p>
<p>They wanted to convey their invasion plans to the elder statesmen; did they still fear that no one would officially speak on their behalf? This illustrates that all Japanese actions are "deceptive." His gesture could be considered a minor self-inflicted hardship tactic or a "using frankness to deceive gentlemen" strategy, making an open discussion more effective than direct lobbying. Moreover, since Saionji was elderly and an independent figure, knowing that someone was spreading the word that their group could still uphold the teachings of the classics would be enough to satisfy him without requiring him to take matters too seriously.</p>
<p>He Jian read the entire passage word by word. Although he understood the general meaning, his lack of effort in studying classical Chinese meant that he didn't recognize a large number of characters, and the writing was so ancient and concise that it was like "a Shandong man eating wheat in winter" – incomprehensible. At the time, he could only explain to Jinwei that the writing in the book was ancient and profound, and he could only understand a general meaning. Upon hearing this, Jinwei even mimicked the gestures of characters in ancient dramas, stroking his whiskers and laughing heartily. The word "stroking" isn't quite appropriate here, as his small "Ren Dan" mustache was too short to stroke; he could only make a stroking expression.</p>
<p>"He Jian-kun," he finally glanced at He Jian, "To truly walk the path of a soldier, one must read the 'Sacred Texts' to achieve greatness!... I know you are a useful talent, so I offer this sincere advice: While establishing merit and building a career, you must also study more books of sages;... Like me, who am now occupied with 'ten thousand matters daily,' I still find time to recite one or two chapters of the Sacred Texts every day. This is one method, as Mencius said, 'to nourish my vast, righteous spirit.'"…</p>
<p>I can only briefly record a few of Jinwei's words here. In reality, what He Jian heard that day was more than a hundred times as much. He babbled on for half an hour, and most of the phrases he used were in classical Chinese. The so-called classical Chinese was the ancient style of language transported from China before the Tang and Song dynasties, a Japanese-style ancient language with countless empty words like "zhi hu ye zhe" added to show off his literary knowledge. After this dramatic scene played out, he then asked He Jian when he returned from the mainland, why he returned, and why he wanted to join the Black Dragon Society, and so on. Finally, he got to the main point, instructing He Jian to describe truthfully what happened that night at the "Xinlv" dance hall when he met Pingzi.</p>
<p>He Jian was a clever and alert character. Hearing Jinwei's tone, he already knew that his every move in the dance hall and Pingzi's questions and answers must have been investigated and recorded. When answering, he absolutely couldn't lie, nor could he add or subtract a single word. He hid the secret of the cigarette case and the telegram in the car, and told everything else that happened, start to finish. However, he was very surprised at how powerful these German fifth columnists were. Thinking back, his words and actions with Pingzi seemed absolutely cautious, and he seemed to have been constantly vigilant, and no one had come near him within a possible distance.</p>
<p>While He Jian was speaking, Jinwei closed his eyes to rest and listened attentively. After He Jian finished speaking, Jinwei simply gestured, beckoning a concubine to come over and whispering a sentence. The concubine immediately turned and went to the side of the gallery. A few minutes later, she brought out a stack of documents and offered them to Jinwei. Jinwei took them, flipped through a few pages, and then had the concubine hand the documents to He Jian. At the same time, he said to He Jian, "You are an honest and alert young man, and you didn't deceive me. That's commendable. However, according to this report, the small paper in the cigarette case had no visible writing on it. It was written with special ink. According to this newly added report, the shape of the paper has changed, and there are traces of active pencil writing, which does not resemble Nakamura Pingzi's handwriting. The pencil's ink color and thickness are exactly the same as those used by the Department. How do you explain this problem? Moreover, the words on the paper don't seem to have any deep meaning. Did you forge them?... You should first read these reports carefully and then answer truthfully!"</p>

<h3>Fighting</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Life is unstable, prices are rising daily, the political situation needs to be clarified, and the flames of war have not ceased in various places. More than a year has passed since the victory. In such a situation, everyone is distressed and irritable, inevitably suffering from liver fire and a bad temper. The prevalence of fighting can be said to have good reason.</p>
<p>As for the all-out martial arts battles on the sports field, they were already common before the war, which is truly a shameful page in the history of Chinese sports. Foreigners value sportsmanship, while we must have a fight to settle things. This kind of sporting event is better replaced by simple brawls, why still use ball games as a facade?</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Seven University Football League, on the first day, Fudan played against Hujiang, and a scene of mixed punches and umbrellas occurred. Whether the competition will continue is yet to be seen. If it does, players and spectators alike will probably have to wear full steel helmets and armor, otherwise, a head-bashing disaster will be hard to avoid.</p>
<p>The purpose of a ball game is to exercise, to strengthen the body. Winning and losing are not the goal, and they shouldn't be valued above all else. If everyone could recognize this, these unpleasant events would not happen again. In fact, everyone understands this principle, but no one is willing to be indifferent to winning or losing, and the desire to win naturally often leads to transgressions.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the focus of national attention. Can the Seven Universities especially restrain themselves in this regard and demonstrate morality on the playing field, setting an example for other places?</p>
<p>Living Drama</p>
<h3>So That's How It Is</h3>
<p>— An</p>
<p>In a Route 15 trolleybus, a sharp voice suddenly cried out.</p>
<p>"Pickpocket! Touching pockets!"</p>
<p>The person shouting was an apprentice, about eighteen or nineteen years old.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Little rascal, looking for a slap in the face!"</p>
<p>The person who said this was a man in his thirties or forties, wearing a woolen overcoat and jodhpurs, tall and with a fierce look on his face.</p>
<p>"You still want to deny it? The bill has already been taken out by you. I grabbed your hand. You still want to deny it?"</p>
<p>"Get out of here with your nonsense, or I'll slap you!" The man raised his hand, making a gesture as if to hit someone.</p>
<p>At this point, everyone on the bus noticed the two of them.</p>
<p>"These pickpockets are really hateful, specializing in touching people's pockets when there are many people," a young man said.</p>
<p>At this time, a young man in a suit pointed at the man and asked:</p>
<p>"What business do you do? What's your name?"</p>
<p>"It's none of your business. Who are you? What gives you the right to question me?" the man replied.</p>
<p>"Why can't I question you? What business do you do?" The man in the suit took a step forward, pressing the question harder.</p>
<p>"I... I sell leather. I'm in the leather business," the man began to answer hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Do you have an ID card? Take it out and let's see."</p>
<p>"I forgot... I forgot to bring it."</p>
<p>"Let's go to the station." The young man in the suit grabbed the man by the collar, and then turned around and asked the apprentice:</p>
<p>"How much money do you have in your pocket?"</p>
<p>"About sixty or seventy thousand."</p>
<p>At this moment, the trolleybus had arrived at the Longmen Road station and stopped. The ticket seller casually opened the door.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the station. Let's go to the station." The young man in the suit, grabbing the man by the collar, also said to the apprentice:</p>
<p>"You come along too. Is there anyone willing to be a witness? Come along too!"</p>
<p>Everyone on the bus looked at each other. No one answered, and there was not a sound.</p>
<p>The young man in the suit took the man and the apprentice off the bus together. I also got off the bus because I had reached my destination.</p>
<p>At this time, the young man in the suit was still aggressive, pulling the man and the apprentice-like person closely behind him.</p>
<p>After walking a few steps, the man twisted his body and said:</p>
<p>"Third Brother, that's enough! My hand hurts."</p>
<p>The young man in the suit looked behind him and let go. And the apprentice took a step forward, and the three walked in a row.</p>
<p>I felt strange and followed them, walking east.</p>
<p>Before long, I saw two people in front, running very fast, and seeing the three of them, they greeted them, saying:</p>
<p>"Business is good today, very successful."</p>
<p>At the same time, the five walked together. I recognized them: the two people were the ones who had just been cursing the pickpocket on the trolleybus.</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, it turned out that all five of them were scoundrels, staging an amusing drama on the trolleybus, deliberately creating a scene to attract the attention of passengers, and taking the opportunity to pick pockets.</p>
<p>So that's how it is. The methods are getting more and more sophisticated!</p>

<h3>The Origin of "Ah San"</h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>On page 6 of the December 2nd edition of Shen Bao, there was a feature article on police administration in the winter defense, which included a passage stating that the former Indian constables were all burly men with full beards and red turbans, which contrasted with their brown-black skin... "Ah San" became a synonym for Indian constables, but its origin is unknown.</p>
<p>As far as the author knows, the reason why Indian constables are called "Ah San" or "Red-Headed Ah San" is that in the past, during the concession era, police stations were commonly called patrol rooms, and the head of the Indian constables was usually a Western police officer of British nationality. They spoke to the Indian constables in English, and the first sentence they often used was "I say..." meaning "Hey"—a way to get someone's attention before starting a conversation. In the early days, when English was not very common, the average citizen living in the concession did not know English, and when they heard Western police officers talking to Indian constables, the opening was always "I say," and they mistakenly thought it was the Indian constable's name. The sound of "I say" was similar to "Ah San," so the rumor spread, and everyone called the Indian constables "Ah San."</p>
<p>Now that the concessions have been recovered and police power unified, Indian constables and Vietnamese constables of different nationalities have resigned one after another. The name "Ah San" for Indian constables has also become a historical term.</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 10</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Mr. Nanguo</p>
<p>Western bands are a new product that has come east with the wind. Shanghai families inevitably use both Chinese and Western bands for weddings and funerals. Because Chinese music is mostly silk and bamboo music, while Western music has a majestic sound, it creates a very lively atmosphere when mixed together in red and white ceremonial processions, even if it is incongruous. This is considered quite satisfactory to extravagant families. Last month, there were many Western bands available for hire at any time. They all had the same uniforms and hats, which is where they were neater than Chinese bands. As for whether the played melodies were "pleasant to the ear," no one cared.</p>
<p>Because wedding and funeral ceremonies had to be scheduled on auspicious days, everyone needed Western bands on the same auspicious day, suddenly creating a sense of being overwhelmed. The people in the bands embraced the philosophy of "accepting all comers." After accepting business, they realized that the number of people was limited and difficult to distribute. Therefore, they had a wild idea to divide the original two bands into three, and the missing members were filled by recruiting old beggar brothers to play the sheng, thus expanding the original three bands into five, and the original four bands into six. Usually, each band had eight or nine members, but now they used a basic team of six people as a band, with the two or three missing members being filled by beggars. Later, this trend became increasingly popular, and a portion of the beggar gangs actually specialized in this kind of temporary short-term work. These people had to be young, well-built, and neat, certainly not the ragged beggars that we imagine. So when they put on the band uniforms, they could actually pass as real band members, and they were given various nondescript instruments to join the procession, and naturally no one could see the flaw.</p>
<p>The performance of this farce was naturally a complete money-making scam. The families holding the ceremonies paid according to the number of people in the band, and hiring beggars could be paid a smaller price. The profit in the middle naturally went to the band leader, and these young beggars, although they followed the band all year round, never had the chance to learn a musical skill. They are forever "Mr. Nanguo," and thinking of this kind of life is really boring enough. Those who work in this field in the gang are called "bai pao." Those who work as "bai pao" have intermittent short-term work, with many days of idleness, so their lives are very destitute. But they rely on it to avoid freezing and starving, and there is no other way to go. It is a pity to give it up, so they bear their seven-foot bodies and can be considered the pitiful insects of the beggar gang!</p>
<h3>"Flying into a Rage" Isn't Real</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>"Flying into a rage" has become an extremely common adjective. But who has ever seen a human's hair stand on end due to emotional excitement? Scientifically speaking, "flying into a rage" is just an adjective. In fact, an angry dog or cat really can have its fur stand on end. But this is an automatic action, because around the roots of their fur, there is a small circle of involuntary muscles (that is, muscles whose activity cannot be controlled by the animal itself, such as the muscles of the human heart, stomach, etc., all belong to this category). When they are angry or frightened, the amount of adrenal secretions in the blood increases, stimulating the involuntary muscles under the hair roots to contract, so their fur stands on end. The roots of human hair do not have this kind of muscle, so they cannot perform "flying into a rage." But human hair can occasionally stand up, which is the result of static electricity, but this situation is very rare.</p>
<p>The hair on the top of the head has no vitality, the part with vitality is the hair root buried one-eighth of an inch under the scalp. So if you want to make your hair grow better, it is ineffective to put effort into the hair on the head. You must find a way to promote the health and vitality of the hair roots.</p>
<p>The lifespan of hair averages four to seven years. When the glands around the hair roots stop working, the life of that hair ends. But the glands will soon reactivate and regrow a new hair to replace it. If the glands permanently stop working, then an unsightly bald spot is created.</p>
<p>Some people believe that shaving makes hair grow faster, and some people believe that shaving is one of the causes of baldness—their "evidence" being that women rarely go bald, while many men do. This is because men shave too many times in their lives, while women rarely have the opportunity to cut off their hair. People with this misconception have not understood that the part that controls hair growth is the hair root, not the exposed hair. Shaving naturally does not affect the hair root, so the growth or death of hair is unrelated to haircuts. As for male baldness, in addition to the aforementioned reason of gland cessation, there is also a hereditary cause. Baldness is a hereditary factor, and like color blindness, it belongs to sex-linked inheritance. Men are twice as likely to inherit baldness as women, so there are more bald men than women.</p>
<p>Chinese unofficial history records that when Wu Zixu passed the Zhaoguan Pass, his hair turned completely white in one night due to worry. This is of course an exaggerated description. But worry can affect hair growth. Worry affects overall health and can cause endocrine glands to be blocked, affecting hair growth. Similarly, worry can also make hair gradually gray.</p>
<p>Many legends about ghosts and monsters say that after a person dies, their hair and beard can still continue to grow. This rumor is untrue. Once a person dies, all tissues in the body immediately and completely stop functioning. The heart is the first to stop, and other parts of the body may be delayed for half an hour or a little longer, but it is very brief. Sometimes, after a person dies, they are not put in a coffin for several days. At this time, we do see that the dead person's beard seems to be a little longer than when they were dying. In fact, this is an illusion. Due to the contraction of the dead person's muscles and skin, the beard appears particularly prominent, thus creating the illusion that it is "a little longer."</p>
<p>A scene from the movie "Waterloo Bridge"</p>
<h3>A Sigh</h3>
<p>— WW</p>
<p>I don't need to be enfeoffed as a marquis of ten thousand households, I just want a basket full of gold bars. When a certain official takes office, like the first character in a Chinese play, he first shows "integrity," then "selflessness," and then "serving the country." Once the demonstration is over, it is taken back and put aside, and when the mask is removed, the truth is revealed. Uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces... even the wet nurse's son are placed in positions one after another. Public affairs are handled "publicly," and everything goes smoothly. The official once said to his relatives: "If I get rich, you will all get rich," truly a heartfelt sentiment.</p>
<h3>An Ounce of Gold, Four Ounces of Fortune</h3>
<p>— Su Kangshi</p>
<p>The price of gold is jumping again, and the resulting consequences will naturally stimulate prices again!</p>
<p>In the ancient Chinese proverb, it is said: "An ounce of gold, four ounces of fortune." This describes how "precious" gold is. Only people with good fortune can "store gold" and "wear gold jewelry." On the contrary, people without good fortune will have the myth of "carrying gold turning into copper," so the status of gold is indeed noble!</p>
<p>But in this year after victory, various prices are jumping, and gold, as the leader, has not gone as crazy as prices. So before victory, an ounce of gold was still "valued," but in this year, an ounce of gold is not enough to buy even a suit, especially since rickshaw pullers and amahs are wearing extremely large rings and jewelry. So the ancient proverb "an ounce of gold, four ounces of fortune" has long been "broken" in this year!</p>
<p>Shanghai's speculative market, doing gold, stocks, public bonds, food, is able to stir up waves at any time and place, indeed having a unique ability. However, this year's speculative market uniquely feels that gold is dull and tasteless, which cannot but be attributed to the official suppression of sales. However, the general prices, mainly "food and clothing," have risen crazily, but there is no way to "resist" them, so the price of gold and the price of goods cannot obtain the "ratio" of pre-war.</p>
<p>Now, because of the frequent wars, the high prices, insufficient production, sluggish sales, the abundance of floating capital, and the devaluation of the legal tender, under all these factors, in the minds of the public, gold is still considered too cheap. Under the concept that "saving money and goods is not as good as saving gold," how can gold not cause a purchasing craze? Although there are "sales" and "suppression," the "attribution" is simply the trend that "the price of gold and the price of goods are not balanced"!</p>
<p>But the most terrible thing is that after the price of gold jumps, the "prices" will follow in the string, which really makes people feel very headache. The masses, the common people, are really like the pilgrims who have been caught with the golden hoop, the more they struggle, the tighter it gets, and their heads hurt so much that they are about to explode!</p>
<h3>Poor Sigh</h3>
<p>— He Ge</p>
<p>A pair of pants and a rope, two sleeves empty, cold and icy; even three-foot-tall children laugh at me! All four elements are empty, repaying a life. With no way to go, I pretend to be a public teacher, ending up putting on airs in an old robe. I find satisfaction in seven holes and eight cracks, salvaging garbage to relieve suffering!</p>
<h3>Feeling</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>Near the Liuhe Pagoda, in the Qinwang Mountains, the roar of tigers was heard at night, alarming the residents. Now, teachers and students of Zhijiang University are trying to capture them to eliminate the tiger threat.</p>
<p>Students of the Biology Department of Sichuan University, in order to study the national treasure, have not only telegraphed the Wenchuan County Government to step up the capture of pandas, but have also specially built panda residences, sweeping and preparing to welcome the arrival of national guests.</p>
<p>The tigers of Hangzhou and the pandas of Wenchuan, although one is a pest and the other is a treasure, are united in that they cannot spend their leisurely years in the mountains again.</p>
<p>Low Key</p>
<h3>Fortune and Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Mao Ying</p>
<p>The stall vendor movement has made people uneasy. Thugs are lawless, destroying the glass windows of shops everywhere, causing glass merchants to take the "opportunity" to raise prices, doubling and redoubling them. The victimized store owner says: this is an unexpected "loss," and the glass merchant says: this is an unexpected "gain"! There are many such accidents in Shanghai!</p>
<h3>Not Worthy of Blame</h3>
<p>— Fang Lai</p>
<p>State-owned enterprises compete with the people for profit, and criticism is often added to the theory. In fact, democratic politics should take the will of the people as its will. Today, the Chinese people mostly aspire to make a fortune, and the government should follow the will of the people, taking making a fortune as a national policy, emulating the legacy of Tao Zhu, diligently seeking profit, and developing together with the people, which is no less than democratic politics, so why is it worthy of blame?</p>
<h3>The British Flag</h3>
<p>— Jiesheng</p>
<p>In the Shenzhen incident, the British army actually "crossed the border," "beat people indiscriminately," and "swept with machine guns indiscriminately," while Hong Kong Governor and Commander-in-Chief Fisting replied, "The soldier did not receive an order to fire at the time, and only accidentally touched the trigger." We already admire the British army's strict adherence to orders, but we still have to ask the general: Was the "indiscriminate sweeping" caused by one mistake after another?</p>
<p>The British soldier said: "One hundred yards from the British border is considered British territory!" That's right, after "crossing the border," these one hundred yards are a "fait accompli," and outside the "border" there is still one hundred yards. One hundred yards, one hundred yards... Thus, the flag of the British Empire will never fall day or night.</p>
<h3>Same Winter Clothes</h3>
<p>— Fei Ran</p>
<p>One radio station reported that a fashion company has women's coats made of American wolf fur for 40 to 50 million yuan each, while another radio station reported donating sets of cotton clothes and socks to refugees for 25,000 yuan per set.</p>
<h3>Extremely Terrible!</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Nothing is more immoral than dangling people's appetites, especially when the appetites being dangled are those of public teachers!</p>
<p>This "wool blanket" empty soup is really dangling enough! In addition to laughing and crying, we cannot help but scold the distribution authorities: extremely terrible!</p>
<p>Common Sense Quiz</p>
<h3>The Science of Heaters</h3>
<p>— Ding Yi Factory</p>
<p>You Might As Well Try to Answer</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder day by day, and we always need a heater in the room, right? Just the various kinds of heaters contain many questions of scientific common sense. This time, let's take this as the central theme.</p>
<p>People with average scientific knowledge should be able to answer seven or more questions without much effort. It would be best if my classmates and colleagues gathered together to guess. This way, you will know whether your common sense is inferior to or surpasses others in this circle. The answers will be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>(1) When the same charcoal is burned in a stove, it burns faster than when it is burned on a "fire pot"; and the charcoal on the "fire pot" burns faster than the remaining charcoal in the ashes. This difference arises from:</p>
<p>A, The trace or excess of "carbon gas" (methane)?</p>
<p>B, The sufficient or insufficient supply of oxygen?</p>
<p>C, Or, the presence or absence of carbon monoxide?</p>
<p>(2) If the room is not well ventilated, in order to keep warm, whether burning a charcoal stove or a coal stove, after a long time, the air we breathe in will change a bit. Among the following three components, which one do you think will continue to increase, and which one will continue to decrease?</p>
<p>A, Oxygen</p>
<p>B, Carbon Dioxide</p>
<p>C, Moisture</p>
<p>(3) Large "charcoal pots," "fire pots," or coke stoves without chimneys leading outside often have bluish flames above the fire. This is because of the presence of which of the following three gases?</p>
<p>A, Oxygen</p>
<p>B, Carbon Monoxide</p>
<p>C, Hydrogen</p>
<p>(4) For coal stoves with tinplate pipes as chimneys, according to the most reasonable design, when the length of the horizontal pipe is increased, the length of the vertical pipe should:</p>
<p>A, Remain the same, without any increase or decrease?</p>
<p>B, Also be increased?</p>
<p>C, Or should it be shortened?</p>
<p>(5) For the driest "hot water radiators" used for indoor heating, the steam temperature inside the radiator pipe, according to the Celsius scale, do you think it is:</p>
<p>A, Below 100 degrees?</p>
<p>B, Above 100 degrees?</p>
<p>C, Or must it be exactly 100 degrees?</p>
<p>(6) Gas stoves are also very clean, convenient, and economical, but when they ignite, do you think they:</p>
<p>A, Release water gas?</p>
<p>B, Still release carbon dioxide gas?</p>
<p>C, Or do not release carbon dioxide gas at all?</p>
<p>(7) After all is said and done, it seems that electric heaters are the cleanest and most hygienic among all heating stoves, although they cost a bit more. But I would like to ask: between the red-hot heating wire and our faces that feel warm when facing it, what is the main method of heat transfer?</p>
<p>A, Radiation?</p>
<p>B, Conduction?</p>
<p>C, Or the emission of electromagnetic waves?</p>
<p>(8) The heating part of an electric heater is the metal wire in the middle. To increase the heat, do you think we should:</p>
<p>A, Increase the voltage and increase the resistance of the metal wire?</p>
<p>B, Decrease the voltage and resistance?</p>
<p>C, Or, just decrease the resistance?</p>
<p>(9) Recently, Shanghai's electrical appliance stores have been selling a new type of so-called "infrared lamp," which is said to be able to dry hair, keep warm, and also be used for treatment. The special reason it can generate heat, you think, is:</p>
<p>A, Utilizing "infrared light" invisible to the naked eye?</p>
<p>B, Utilizing the bright light of white heat?</p>
<p>C, Or utilizing ultraviolet light?</p>
<p>(10) Imagine putting a rubber hot water bottle in a quilt (note: "imagine" only). Suppose the quilt is very tight and thick, and no heat leaks out at all. Then, if boiling water is poured in before going to bed, the water temperature when you wake up tomorrow morning should be:</p>
<p>A, 100 degrees Celsius?</p>
<p>B, Close to the indoor room temperature?</p>
<p>C, Or, close to the human body temperature, which is about 37 degrees Celsius, but slightly lower?</p>
