<p>〔本報北平十日電〕北平官民今在四周硝烟瀰漫中慶祝國慶，火熾的外表，不能掩蓋人民因戰爭所受的痛苦，北平行轅上午有慶祝鷄尾酒會，到者外人多於中國人，女人多於男人，負責指揮作戰者，多未露面，北平行轅參謀長王鴻韶與空軍副總司令王叔銘，未及與其他來賓周旋，即同進側室，借地談話，新聞記者則追踪打聽戰報，興緻較濃的，倒是許多不同國籍的外賓。</p>

<h3>陳總長發表廣播勉官兵努力建國　在主席領導下忠勇奮門</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕陳參謀總長於雙十節晚在軍中廣播電臺，對全國官兵廣播致詞，略稱：今天是我們抗戰勝利國府還　後的第一個國慶紀念日，舉國上下莫不歡欣鼓舞，同仲慶祝，而尤可慶慰者，則是今日上午中常會曾有決議，以現在國府主席蔣先生任期屆滿，茲因國民大會召開在即，經決議蔣先生之任期延至　法實施後，依法當選總統就職之日止，故我全體官兵仍可在主席英明領導之下，忠勇奮鬥，救國救民，以維護國家民族的獨立自由，加速統一和平建設成功。昨晚主席對全國同胞播講，想我全體官兵亦均聆悉，茲再略舉三點，以資說明：</p>
<h3>軍令必須統一</h3>
<p>（一）主席的一貫主張，就是和平統一與建設。誠然，我們國民革命的目標是在實行三民主義，建立平等獨立自由的中華民國，而建國的基本條件，首在國家的統一與社會的安定，所以政府當前對時局方針，是以保障國家的統一爲第一，並循和平的途徑以求統一，故必須實行整編方案，使軍隊國家化，建立全國性的軍隊，以求軍令的統一，同時並袪除地方的割據，令國家的法令制度能推行於全國，以求政令的統一，即希我全體官兵，篤實踐履。共同遵守。</p>
<h3>剷除建設障礙</h3>
<p>（二）現階段革命的主要任務是在切實實行民權主義與民生主義，以加緊完成建國大業。</p>
<p>（三）關於全體官兵的生活間題，我們主席對此非常注意，並且不斷的求改善，惟因國內政治不能安定，致　濟始終失　，物價日在飛漲，　　雖迭經提高，終非根本辦法，我全體官兵，過去已飽受生活威脅，現雖還都，而生活仍甚困苦，尤其復員兵的生計，主席更所關切，計劃早經擬訂，而實施則因生產建設尙未開始，故轉業時被阻礙，想我們全體官兵亦能諒察。惟本席以職　所在，仍當悉力以赴，軍人以捍衛國家爲天職，原不較量一時的苦樂，試思一般民衆，老弱轉乎溝壑，少壯流亡各地，苦樂縣殊，何　霄壤，因此本席以爲凡祇知增加個人的財富而不顧國家民族的安危者，非惟眼光短淺，亦是燕巢幕上。故今日之事，決非枝校節節所能解決，必須從速澈底剷除建設障礙，肅淸貪汚，土劣，並改革整個經濟制度，以發展民族工業，改進國民經濟，才是根本辦法。</p>
<h3>安定社會生活</h3>
<p>過去的八年抗戰，旣賴我全體官兵的忠勇犧牲而獲得光榮的勝利，今後的建國工作，仍須我全體官兵齊心一德，掃除和平的障礙，鞏固國家的統一，過去八年抗戰抵禦外患，其目的是在救國，今後掃除和平的障礙，以安定社會的生活，其目的則在救民，希各互相勗勉，共向建國的大道邁進。</p>
<h3>何應欽致書王陵基列述在美觀感</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌九日電〕聯合國軍事參謀團我國團長何應欽飛美後，日昨致函本省主席王陵基，列述在美觀感。略謂：到美兩　，對於美國情形，尙不能有　　之硏究，惟觀感所及，覺美國可謂一富强康樂之國家。國民生活一般均甚安適，生活水準不僅較高，且甚平衡，城市鄕村生活亦無多大之軒輕，合理之生活幾於人人都能享受，就衣言：無論城鄕，平民均着淸潔整齊之衣服，就食言：平民每餐一菜一湯，每日可吃牛奶，具備其所需之營養，富人亦不澠如此；就住言：因非大家庭制度，每家均甚簡單，必需之臥室，客室，餐室，浴室，廚房，則皆具備，工人，農人亦可自有房屋；就行言：平均每三人至五人有汽車一輛，工人　人亦可自有汽車，簡言之，頗少有奢侈豪華與貧無立錐之懸殊現象，其富人多致力於如何發展生產建設之事業，並不專　個人之享受，一般婦女，除同樣各有職業外，歸家仍須烹飪洗衣，並作家庭一切瑣事，因平常人家鮮有能僱用　人者。</p>
<p>至公共建築，公共娛樂，福利事業，則規模極爲宏大。凡此種種，均爲我國所應借　，其所以能至此之由，自係工業發達，交通便利，敎育普及之故，但所以能收此成效者，愚以爲實由於官吏服務之精神，與國民守法之精神，無論何級之官吏，皆以全副精神，盡其職責，其前提爲國家與人民，其目標爲國防與民生，即如何促國家之　盛與國民之福利而已。吾人所見，政府一切設施，莫不以此爲目標，而　收成效，絕無爲官吏而只做官不做事，爲私不爲公者。</p>
<p>至於守法精神，無論何項規定，人民均能自動遵守，例如交通路口之紅綠燈、均係機械自動管制，車行　紅燈處，雖前面並無車輛橫過，亦停車待綠燈開啓時始前行。故各街口完全無交通警察，而車行井井有序。又各地道　人口處，並無收票人員，乘客自動繳費五分於所設箱內後人內乘車，而並無！購者。諸如此類，皆足表現國民守法之精神，此爲一切能有秩序上軌道之基礎。吾國一切事業，不能成功或進步迴緩之原因，即爲缺乏此兩種精神。近年雖均有進步，但猶遠不及此。愚意吾國尙應竭力提倡建立此兩種精神，然後一切良好計劃，良好法則，始能推行盡利，否則空言建築，實難則其實效。</p>
<p>美人生活在辦公時極爲認眞公畢則生活極爲活潑，或作運動，或作其他正當娛樂，感覺生氣勃勃，星期日則大半驅車郊外，渡其快樂之假期，一切設備亦足以適應人民此項正當需要，即以上所述政府之設施，以人民福利爲目標也。</p>
<p>美國國民對於軍人極爲尊視，政府　　官兵之福利　極注意，無論部隊或軍事　關，均設有軍官俱樂部及士兵但樂部，有各種正當娛樂之設備，使官兵身心愉快，　　有所寄託，有合作社，使官兵生活上得各種之便利，對於有眷　之官兵，其生活及居住並定有補助辦法，至對於復員官兵，亦訂有種種優待辦法，除　給外，給予免費入學校讀書之機會，對其婚姻或已有之家庭，亦有相當之輔助，一切辦法，使無論現役或復員退役之官兵，皆能安心，此實爲維　軍隊紀律，增强軍隊力量之重要措施。愚意吾國建軍之始，對於此點實有注意之必要。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>但願喜訊得能證實</h3>
<p>蔣主席的國慶廣排詞，一則說：「我主張三人會議與五人會議應同時召開，…協議改組國民政府，…解決實施整軍統編方案有關的問題，一俟獲得協議，只要共產黨能够停止他軍事行動，不再攻擊國軍，則政府立即發佈停止衝突的命令」，再則說，「政府對於共產黨，在任何情勢之下，始終不放棄開誠商談的期待。」這表示政府決不關閉和平之門，更顯然指出，只要有協議，不但休戰十天，而且可以永久停戰。這是我們昨天在國慶日所獲得的一個重大喜訊。</p>
<p>昨日上午，上海各界慶祝國慶大會，市民代表呼籲敦促中共代表周恩來氏入京商談，同時張君勸氏等政協代表訪孫院長，請其赴京斡旋，下午又訪周氏，促其進京。此外並聞司徒大使將以調人資格，繼馬歇爾特使之後來滬一行，而梁漱溟氏除有新建議外，亦將於今晨來滬，促周氏回京，進行和談。這都是表示中外人士渴望和平，不容拖宕。而昨天外傳周恩來氏有允於下週返京繼續商談之一說，尤其是我們所樂聞的喜訊。</p>
<p>今天我們惟一的希望，就是：千萬不可讓這些接二連三的喜訊到頭來仍是落空。本報昨日社論曾盼望「使我們度此沉鬱憂惶的國慶以後，居然獲得天外飛來的喜訊，」而今喜訊居然已有飛來的風聲了，但願其得能證實。機會不可再失，和平之門不可再堵。</p>
<p>昨天中央當會臨時會議，決議　「蔣主席任期延至憲法實施後依法當選之總統就職之日爲止。」這更充分表示政府期望早日實施憲政，還政於民的決心。我們歡喜讚頌這一決議；同時，我們祈禱各黨各派，趕快開誠布公，貫澈和平商談，鞏固國家統一，實施民主憲政，奠定建國基礎。但我們人民這個一致的願望，今後能否實現，就看中共領袖們的良知此時能否發見了！</p>
<h3>銀根壓得倒物價嗎？</h3>
<p>金融政策目前應該峯迴路轉了！</p>
<p>物價上漲的原因很多，簡單地說起來，却不外三種：（一）通貨膨脹，（二）生產减少，和（三）成本昂貴。如果要抑平物價，自然以分途並進，從根本上設法，最爲有力。萬一祗知側重一點，而忽視其他，非但不易生效，有時或竟會招致相反的結果。試有目前物價與金融的變動情形，這就是一個很明顯的實例。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，由於通貨膨脹的結果，造成了空前的高物價。當局爲釜底抽薪起見，竭力地平衡預算，减少發行額，這本不失爲極正當的一種辦法。且據當局宣佈，自本年七月份起，已經停止增發新鈔，倘所言不虛，這也可說是財政上的一種大收穫，値得我們贊佩。但是物價方面，究竟如何呢？照上海生活費指數說，七月份是四四九，四二〇·二八，八月份是四五三，六七四·六二，九月份是四九六，七三九·七〇，似乎還相當的穩定。但一般躉售物價的漲勢，却十分明顯，拿各種主要商品來說，通常些已漲至一二倍。旬日以來，漲風愈熾，如紗，布，人造絲，毛絨綫等，皆見過空前的新高價。我們不管牠的原因是甚麼，實銷也罷，投機也罷，走私也罷，但新高價到底是新高價。如果說，這還是由於通貨膨脹的結果，那麽，這兩個月來，當局的發行政策，似乎並沒有變動過，而且相反地正在努力抽緊銀根，緊縮通貨。不聽見目前的拆息，又回到了二角以上嗎？各種生產貸款，不是已經宣吿了停頓嗎？又不聽見商業行莊的頭寸，也都十分拮据嗎？可知物價的上漲，還有其他的原因，單是减少通貨，緊縮信用，並不能得到預期的效果。</p>
<p>所謂其地的原因，就是上面所說的生產和成本問題了。這兩個問題，初看似乎是各別的，其實却又是互相關聯的。因爲在高利貸之下，無法减輕成本，在高利貸之下，又怎樣可以促進生產？現在工商業最感痛苦的，不是無法得到及時的和適量的融通資金嗎？各團體歷次的呼籲和請願，無不以發放生產低利貸欵爲主要目標之一。地們也决不會不知道通貨增加，要影響到一般物價的，，但是盲目的緊縮銀根，結果便是减少生產，减少生逢的結果也是刺激物價。而且缺乏物資，其最後結果，恐怕連願出高價，也有無法獲得供給的一日。而減工停業，失業增加，又必然地會相隨而來。本來很簡單的經濟問題，很可能地會牽引到社會問題和政治問題。所以兩害相權，到底還是走那一條路比較有利，應該値得愼重考慮的。</p>
<p>不幸得很，這個問題，似乎始終沒有引起只打算盤的當局的注意。當局的一貫政策，在最近這幾個月來，似乎老是盲目地釘住在收縮通貨這一點上，而且物價愈漲，他們的態度也愈堅決，好像通貨膨脹乃是物價上漲的唯一原因似的，除了緊縮而外，沒有他法。工商各界要求解散四聯的呼聲，固然不値得堂高簾遠者的一顧，便是發放貸款，簡化手續，放寬抵押品等等，也始終無切實的辦法。一面則應繳中央銀行的有款準備金，嚴格地徵收，五千萬以上的貸款，依舊須經過重重的核准乎續，透支戶頭，加緊箝制，各種接收物資和國營生產的標賣，配售，所得的價款，儘量回籠，新增各稅收又粉紛地展開。結果是：一切工商業吿貸無門，固然透不過氣來，而一般商業行莊，對於中央銀行，旣要繳存準備金，對於聯合準備庫，又要繳存抵押品，公債尙未上市，所執各種債票，無法變作現款，道契及土地執業證等地產，又不許轉相抵押。據說，商業行莊所收存款，除掉留備隨時提用者之外，只有四成可供活用。在這種情形之下，可留充工商貸款的能有幾何？要靠這少許資金來派付利息及一切開支，高利貸又如何壓得下去？這幾日來，因爲銀根逾抽愈緊了，便是第一流的行莊，也都不肯輕易放款，甚有收回放款，以自站穩步的。因爲他們都有一種印像，以爲萬一有些疏失，恐怕不易得到援助。所以營業方針，不能不極端愼重，對於工商業的困難，簡直有愛莫能助的模樣。</p>
<p>那麽，工商業的危機，眞個讓牠一天一天地深刻化嗎？等到商店一齊關了門，工廠一齊停了工，於物價政策，通貨政策，財政政策，還會有補益嗎？假如肯進一步加以考慮，那末狠明顯地，現行的金融方針，目前應已到了峰迴路轉的地步了！歸納起來，我們願作下列貢獻，備當局採擇：</p>
<p>（一）了解一味地膠着於抽緊銀根，並不能達到抑平物價的目的。</p>
<p>（二）要認淸對象，寬放低利生產貸款，以解救垂危的商業。</p>
<p>（三）國家行局對於商業行莊的生產放款，應即儘量承做轉抵押和重貼現。</p>
<p>（四）一切可靠的地產等押品，應按照上海向來習慣，儘量承受。限制。</p>
<p>（五）商業行莊的放款，不應予以無理的</p>
<p>（六）國營與民營事業，在金融上，應予以平等待遇。</p>
<p>（七）通貨可收縮，信用則不宜收縮。</p>
<p>（八）國家行莊，實行專業化，使各行局對它自己的存放業務負責任，不當加以重重的箝制；中央銀行則應確實做到銀行之銀行。</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州訊〕本縣臨時參議會以接收淸査團京蘇組蒞蘇後，雖積極展開淸査工作，惟因限於時間，除僅催令各接收機關提呈原始淸册外，對各工廠倉庫，以及其他所接收之十產業，縱即一一前往視察，亦屬走馬看花，徒具形式而已，爲表達民意，提供意見，俾能協助淸査起見，特定七日下午二時茶會招待淸査團，事先柬邀，忽奉覆謂時間寳貴，謝絕出席，消息傳出後，本邑輿論譁然，以該組曾抽暇於六日游覽名勝，當亦應抽暇出席臨參會茶會，遂一致敦請聽取民意，臨參議會方面，更派范副議長公任親趨旅邸，專誠邀約始獲允諾，此一茶會始幸未流產。</p>
<p>七日下午二時，參議員雲集會址中山堂，鵠候至三時許，淸査團始由組長范予遂領導，姗姗蒞塲，省府主任秘書許聞天列席，茶會於焉熱烈展開。首由議長單束　致歡迎詞，幷希望對日來淸査工作之結果，能坦白公開發表，俾便轉達民衆。繼由參議員顏益生·范君博·朱貫一·朱家積，先後提出接收痛心史報吿，大致歸納六點：</p>
<p>（一）省黨政接收委會接收僞省府所在地之拙政園，係蘇邑唯一名園，當省府還治鎭江，非惟蔣僞公有傢具搬走一空，抑且將原有古玩陳　亦席捲而去，即地板應堂花框亦未伴免。</p>
<p>（二）僞省黨都所在地之中山堂，係戰前蘇州商民集　建築，經省黨政接收委會接收後，將一切應用器具掃數運回鎭江，甚至區額亦被　括。</p>
<p>（三）早報社係顏益生於戰前私人創辦，戰時　赴渝，早報機器材料即爲敵僞佔用，發行僞江蘇日報，勝利後經呈准中宣部咨照省府，轉飭蘇縣府保管，詎顏返蘇後，該項機器材料，已由省黨政接收委會撥交蘇報社應用，　請發還未果。</p>
<p>（四）國貨公司創於戰時，純係商辦抵制日貨之企業組織，因有張一鵬小部份股本，敵產處藉口逆股，遲不發還，現內部破壞殊甚，再不修理，已有全部傾圯可能。</p>
<p>（五）縣　第二區本凟，曾被敵寇圈佔大量民田，建築飛機塲，當時農民，因之傾家不知凡幾，勝利後爲軍事機關接收，曾一再　請發還未果，現農民不惟不能運用生產，抑且每年賠貼糧租。</p>
<p>（六）倉庫時閙失竊，損害鉅重，決非竊賊單純所可爲，應請澈底調査，絕不能爲之任意矇蔽。</p>
<p>參議員報吿完畢，省府代表許聞天秘書　起立，對指責省黨政接收委員會各點，逐條辯論，一時唇槍舌劍，備形激烈，最後經淸査團范組長起立答復，略謂：「所提接牧工作各項痛心事實，本組當儘可能代爲解決，或報請中央處理。物資處理問題，因尙有中央直屬接收機構，延不移交，故至今仍未能付　實施。吾人來　數日，見軍事接牧倉庫，糧　堆積如山，日益　　，　此　國　饉之秋，此種矛盾現象，言之間不勝痛心，當爲轉陳中央，　遠完成處理工作，至於本組淸査工作，因人簡地廣，僅能稍獲頭　，臨行之前，自當有詳細報吿」，茶會至五時卅分，宣吿散會。</p>

<h3>實行公教待遇標準</h3>
<p>編輯先生！</p>
<p>我是一個浦東南滙鄕村裏的一個小學敎員，因目前待遇的菲薄，不得不陷在苦悶的深淵裏，我幾次想脫離敎育界而另謀途徑，終於被「待遇不久或可改善，「一念中輟了，但照目前的情形看起來，改善待遇的希望，完全成爲泡影，我決計拋棄敎鞭另謀發展了。</p>
<p>我們鄕村敎員的待遇，說來很慚愧，一個月的叫跳，僅六萬九千四百元，還要扣去膳費，有時請了假，還要出代課費，如果生了病，那更糟糕，唉！這區區的待遇，在生活程度這樣高漲的當兒，一個人的生活尙難維持，那能談得到養家活口呢！</p>
<p>政府方面雖屢次調整公教人員的待遇，但我們鄕村裏的小敎得不到一些好處，六月份起政府調整江蘇省公敎人員待遇爲生活津貼五萬五千元，底薪二百四十倍，依底薪六十元計算，共六萬九千四百元，但我們所得到的六七兩月僅每月二萬八千四百元。八月份起又調整了，規定生活津貼七萬五千元，底薪四百四十倍，依底薪六十元計算，共十萬一千四百元，但我們所拿到的八九兩月，僅六萬九千四百元。我眞不解，政府所定的公敎人員待遇標準，地方政府爲什麽不照他去實行，如果說是省令還沒有接到，標準無從根據，省政府爲什麽至今還不發出命令？如果說是田賦還沒有征收，地方經費無着，何不請省府撥給？如果說是省經費也無着，何不請政府撥給？我想政府旣調整公敎人員待遇，必有縝密的經費支出決算，不致使公敎人員空歡喜吧！如果說是政府也沒有辦法，地方政府爲什麼不負籌措維持之責，難道坐視教育破產，敎師逃避嗎？</p>
<p>最後我的呼籲，希望教育當局，體諒小敎們的苦衷，照新標準發給，六七兩月補發，使小敎們安心做事，替天眞活潑的兒童造福。（一帆）</p>

<h3>美英土結成堅強陣綫　抵抗蘇聯控制海峽　英美決以經濟援助土耳其</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕此間外交當局今日披露：美英土三國現正結成堅强陣綫，抵抗蘇聯對韃靼尼爾海峽重新提出之要求，惟三國仍願詳細討論蘇方在該海峽之權利。同時美國務院宣佈：以信用放款二千五百萬美元貸了希臘，採購美陸軍海外剩餘物資。此與三週前希臘發生內戰危機時，英美兩國政府所商獲之非正式結論相符合，即美國當以巨大經濟協助支援希臘現政府是。聞英美政府對於土耳其亦有幾似之決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕外交界稱，美政府再度照會蘇聯，聲明美國反對蘇土聯防韃靻尼爾海峽。復悉土政府致蘇覆牒，將斷然拒絕聯防建議，但並不拒絕就海峽未來地位作直接談判。</p>
<p>〔路透社安加拉十日電〕英駐土大使，美駐土代辦。昨與土外交部秘書長，就韃靻尼爾海峽問題，作半小時之談話。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕關於美國將以蘇聯要求管理韃靼海峽問題提出聯合國機構申訴一說，頃由消息靈通人士加以評論。略謂美政府曾考慮此舉之可能性，果爲事實，但經審愼研究之後，發現尙有種種困難不易克服，至少暫時不致提出。同時美政府將於今後四十八小時之內，公佈美國關於海峽問題致蒙德婁公約簽字各國之兩次照會，並重申美國對於海峽之立塲。</p>
<h3>和會討論對羅和約　英要求與列強平等待遇　美主張多瑙河自由通航</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十日廣播：和會大會今日下午三時四十分開會，莫洛托夫主席，繼續討論對羅和約，貝文首先登壇發言。謂苟聯合王國不能獲得與其他强國平等之待遇，則英國難於接受對羅和約。例如羅馬尼亞之石油問題，貝文稱官方所訂石油售價，低於其成本，盟國在羅所有之石油權益組織不能繼續以自己之金錢自行支付。關於多瑙河自由通航問題，貝文表示支持法方建議，按法國建議在六個月期限內召開會議，以解決是項問題，爲免躭誤時間起見，比利時之代表乃放棄發言。繼之莫洛托夫於掌聲由登壇發言。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕和會全體會議今日上午九時續開檢討對羅和約仍由莫洛托夫主席，美代表即參議員范登堡發言，堅決要求多瑙河自由通航，及巴爾幹半島全境之自由貿易稱，「欲求中歐之經濟健全與和平，多瑙河非自由通航不可。該河若不開放，將成悲慘而反動的錯誤」。依照四國規定之討論時間，和會今日必須最後通過對羅和約草案。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十日廣播：維辛斯基對於美方所提多瑙河自由通航問題竭力攻擊，並提出反問云：美國是否願意將聖勞倫斯河國際化？維氏指出英帝國內部有貿易優先制度，美國在古巴及菲律濱等國有特殊貿易櫬利，則蘇聯在巴爾幹方面亦應有貿易優先權云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕前總統戴高樂今日重行發表聲明，批評法蘭西第四共和國新憲章，謂其將首致政府孱　無力，繼陷入無政府狀態，最後則成爲獨裁制，因此熱誠希望法國人民於本月十三日舉行公民複決時，將此項新憲法與以否決。此項聲明已使戴氏與人民共和黨間之裂痕加深，因人民共和黨曾與共產，社會兩黨在制憲議會中聯合起草此項新憲法。</p>

<h3>中東英軍總司令　抵希臘檢閱駐軍　希擬訓練國民兵戡亂</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典九日電〕中東英陸軍總司令鄧浦賽中將抵此後，將與英軍將領晤談。若干觀察家相信，鄧氏來希後，將引起政治上之重大反響。鄧氏將赴薩隆尼加檢閱馬基頓境內之英軍，並視察英軍事團訓練希軍之情形。民衆原定今日在雅典示威，抗議巴黎和會決議，臨時經公安部長下令禁止。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦九日電〕據可靠方面消息：「馬基頓解放陣錢」所屬部隊及其他游擊隊，刻正在希臘境內到處活動。內閣總理蔡爾達重斯爰乃提出一項計劃，擬訓練國民兵與其作戰。英政府對此亦將表示贊同，並願以輕兵器供結之。據英外部接近人士談稱，希臘政府要求英國供結武器，唯一目的乃在增强其本國之安全，英國對此是否同意，尙須俟至陸軍部工業生產部曁外務部會同討論之後始能決定。希臘決定動員若干級後備兵，在事前並未與英政府磋商，但此項決定僅與希臘政府有關，該國政府不與他人磋商自屬正當云。</p>

<h3>第五縱隊在美活躍　美國商會發出警告</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕美國商會今日發表四十頁之報吿書，指摘第三國際雖稱業已解散，但在世界各地依然活躍如故。該報吿指責美國共黨爲第五縱隊，在同情共黨人士之支持下，控制紐約州之美國勞工黨。該報告稱，「彼等足以控制紐約州之勢力，而該州之投票在總統選舉中殊關重要。共黨人數雖不多，但力量並不薄弱，故吾人爲自衛計，最低限度應將共黨黨員名單及經費來源予以公開的檢查，同時司法部應搜集暴露該黨眞相之情報。」該報吿謂，「共產主義倘在中國得勢，則數萬萬人將被利用「遵從蘇聯計劃」，從事勞役及軍役。英美在雅爾達會議中，曾以中國東北及他處之廣大權利讓與蘇聯，足以威脅國民政府對於此等富庶區域之繼續統治權。」</p>
<h3>流星雨奇觀　美天文家目覩談</h3>

<h3>美以象徵武力支持外交政策</h3>
<p>環球飛行計劃意義重大</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日電〕現有一項跡象日益明顯，即美國決以象徵之武力，支持其外交政策。一週以前，海長福萊斯特曾宣佈航空母艦羅斯號駛往地中海之眞正任務，昨陸軍部負責航空事宜之次長薛明敦宣佈：擬以大隊超空堡壘作環繞世界之飛行，作爲支持外交政策之另一「工具」，絕不願在國際方面究將機和抑或增加恐懼。薛氏稱：渠希望國務院能准許該項飛行計劃，薛氏宣佈上項計劃後，不久國務院發言人即點首宣稱：該院「並不反對」。薛氏吿報界稱：該機隊將有超空堡壘八至廿四架，飛行之主要目的爲表示轟炸機之力量，足以在世界任何地點完成任務。並稱：超空堡壘可能成爲聯合國使用之工具。</p>
<h3>義大利擾攘不寗　失業羣流血暴動　暴徒衝入總理辦公室搗毀傢具　政府公報稱疑有政治背景</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬九日電〕工人數千名今日在政府公署前舉行示威運動，反對解雇，結集羣衆至二三萬人，與警察發生衝突。警察獲得軍隊增援，經三小時半紛擾後，始將羣衆驅散。官方公報稱，一人殞命，示威者五十人及警察廿九人受傷。暴徒數十名曾衝入維米那爾宮直至加斯貝利總理辦公室，一路搗毀傢具。公報中指責搗亂份子有意使示威運動化爲暴動，警察利用木棍武器及警備車兩輛，驅散宮前羣衆，宮內旋由軍警嚴密戒備。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬九日電〕政府大厦前今日發生流血暴動，乃爲近月來騷擾之高潮。此種騷擾由於失業而起，赤貧之農民强佔土地，對於政府担保之農田改革進行遲緩，深表不滿。失業者在全國各地，强佔市政府及稅收機關。回國軍人則企圖剝奪女子之工作。義大利爲被征服國，需要原料始能生產，暫時又不能大批移民，若干觀察家認爲目前局勢之嚴重，與一九三〇年時代相等，當時勞工擾攘至向羅馬大進攻之地步。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬九日電〕政府門前發生流血暴動後，加斯貝利總理令日向報界發表談話，略謂：政治勢力正岡利用失業搗亂，任何政府對於此種情形必加對抗。示威者以爲佔據政府即有辦法乎？共和派報紙稱，此種流血事件係帝制派及墨索里尼之黨徒所煽動。反對派報紙則以大字標題登載消息，謂工人正在全城游行，追究何人下令開槍。</p>
<h3>攻西伯里亞計劃　日皇曾批閱核準</h3>
<p>東條律師淸潮劣跡昭彰</p>
<p>〔路透社東京十日電〕蘇檢察官向遠東戰犯法庭提出證件，證明日皇曾批閱並同意一九三五年日進攻西伯里亞之秘密計劃。美籍辯護律師表示此項蹬件不能適用，因日皇並非被吿之一，然庭長魏勃仍裁定採納該一供辭作爲證件。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京九日電〕日第一戰犯東條之辯護人淸瀨一郞，老奸巨滑，曾指責遠東國際法庭之組織法，多方作梗，剛使日戰犯審判延宕。昨經蘇聯檢察官提出證件，證明淸瀨曾爲國策協會會員，該會受財閥與政府津貼，草擬侵略計劃。其計劃之一，即保持日本種族之純粹血統，此與德人保持日耳曼種族血統如出一轍。計劃中擬將西伯里亞俄人，盡行遷移，代以武裝日本農民，並以留居之俄人作爲奴雜，供日本役使，完成日本所謂「東亞共榮」之目標。</p>

<p>昨日爲我中華民國三十五年國慶日，且係勝利後第二屆雙十節，全市懸旗熱烈慶祝，本市各界並於昨日上午九時，假南京西路大光朋大戲院，舉行慶祝大會，由吳國楨，方治，吳開先，潘公展，杜月笙，馮有眞等任主席團，計到孔祥熙，程滄波，謝仁劍，俞叔平，及各界代表凡二千餘人，會塲佈置整潔肅穆，中懸國父遺像及國黨旗外，並豎一電燈紥製之雙十，光耀奪目，塲內左右側書有「鞏固統一，保障和平，實行憲政，努力建國」十六大字，大會於悠揚樂聲中開始，由吳市長國楨主席，領導行禮後，即席報吿稱：</p>
<p>昊市長詞</p>
<p>今日爲勝利後第二屆國慶日，除追憶辛亥革命之輝煌史蹟外，尤當感佩蔣主席之賢明領導，血戰八年，而獲得眞正之勝利，今日與諸君共聚一堂，感觸萬端，目下侵略者雖早經打倒，而我國之建國統一工作，仍不能達到理想階段，如我人虛心自省，必可發覺我民族之弱點，正如做事做人方面，均有若干欠缺之處，第一，欠缺責任心，我賢朋領袖，無時無刻不注意責任，而我人工作，應以國族社會爲前提，一切事情，均應負起責任，努力做去，第二，欠缺守法精神，目下到處均喊民主，若干人士，實不知民主何解，凡國家法令，在歐西諸國，舉國上下莫不一體奉行，而我國家人民，對於國家法令，似尙未能遵守，例如本市之交通管制，屢遭不守者之破壞。第三，缺少同情心，關於此點，本人曾親睹一人力車被焚，車夫痛哭失聲，而旁觀者竟然大笑，足證明我人同情心之缺少。上海爲一大都市，國際觀感所繫，我人必需剷除自私自利，共同建國，以達成主席對建設新中國之願望云云。</p>
<p>孔祥熙詞</p>
<p>繼開始演講，首由孔祥熙致詞，孔氏首對十字加以解釋，並引證西文稱：十字實包涵有宗敎，犧牲，慈善等意義。繼則述及我國雖已獲得勝利，而離理想建國階段，尙屬太遠，我人實應奮發努力，「人必自侮，然後人侮之，」「自大」爲「臭，」「止戈爲「武，」我人應犧牲小我，完成大我，今日之製十節，雖似走向十字路口，亦似背負十字架，尤需認淸目標，共謀和平統一，則中國前途自極光明燦爛。</p>
<p>方主委詞</p>
<p>方主委治繼孔祥熙之後演說，略謂：今日在此慶祝國慶，特別興奮，去歲在陪都參加勝利後首次慶祝大會，今日本人來到全國經濟文化中心之上海，眼見國旗飄揚，衰心至感愉快，全市五百萬市民，與全國四萬五千萬同胞，當均同具此感，中華民國建立已卅五年，即已長至卅五歲，凡人逢生辰，每多回憶過去，瞻望將米，國家亦必如此，故當此國慶之日，人人對國事必有回憶過去，策勵將來之感想，中華民國艱難肇造，流革命之血，結民主之花，于慶祝辛亥建立，但辛亥之後，破壞革命者有之，盜竊國權者有之，外侮侵略者有之，奮鬥多年，大難已過，今日之得能在此共慶國慶，完成獨立復興之大業，這是我國父遺敎三民主義之力量，也是蔣主席賢明領導之力量，更是全國人民萬衆一心，愛國家，愛民族之力量，吾人今日不僅回憶過去，尤應策勵將來，此即應鞏固統一，保障和平，並加緊發揚民主精神，但勝利一年，國內交通未復，社會經濟動盪，人民生活不安，我人深知惟有加緊統一保障和平，乃能符合人民之意志，再進而實施憲政，努力建國，我人因而一致希望國大如期召開，使建國之百年大計奠定，三民主義新中國得以建立，此爲建國之基本任務，尤爲我上海與全國同胞所應共同努力者，要和平要建國，必須發揮民主精神，始能得之，古人說：「民之所好者好之，民之所惡者惡之，今日吾人不僅如此，尤應要好之者行之，惡之者去之，」如好之不能行，惡之不能去，此實爲反民主，今日全國人民要求和平，要求統一，要求民主，但偏有少數人背道而馳，要倡亂，要分裂，不願和平，不願建設，不願實行眞正的民主，此乃違反民主，反抗時代，倒行逆施，本人希望我全市五百萬同胞，一德一心，在吳市長·潘議長·徐副議長之領導下，共同努力，發抓眞正之民主之精神，以建設新上海，與三民主義的新中國。</p>
<p>潘議長詞</p>
<p>繼由潘公展氏演說，潘氏對新中國的建設，提出補充意見，並對前晚蔣主席廣播，昭吿全國，凡有良心的中國人，未忘國家民族的同胞，都應懺悔每人的過去，來參加和平統一建國的工作，今日我一面歡笑慶祝，然國是如此，一面却感到沉痛，希望中共代表周恩來即赴南京，參加會商，重啓和平之門，否則乃違反全上海市民之希望云云。詞畢，即由吳市長宣讀大會致主席致敬電文，及慰問抗戰陣亡將土家屬致敬電文，一致通過，最後呼口號散會，其原文如后：</p>
<p>上主席電</p>
<p>（一）上主席電：「主席鈞鑒，勝利經年，建國肇始，欣逢國慶，薄海同歡，鈞座領導羣倫，河山再造，成復興之偉業，奠百年之大計，仰念効勤，同深愛載，肅電致敬，伏乞鈞察，上海市各界慶祝三十五年國慶紀念大會謹叩。」（二）致陣亡將士遺屬電：「全國抗戰陣亡將士家屬均鑒，勝利經年，欣逢國慶，當復興之肇始，慶禹甸之重光，惟念此壯麗河山，皆諸將士鮮血之結果，英魂雖逝，浩氣長存，緬懷壯烈，感奮曷已，而諸家屬爲國家受慘痛之犧牲，對民族盡偉大之貢獻，全國國民尤深級佩，專電致敬，諸惟亮察，上海市各界慶祝三十五年國慶紀念大會叩」。</p>

<h3>陳納德空運隊改隸行總</h3>
<p>協助行總運輸救濟物資之陳納德空運隊，已遵有關當局之意，改爲行總空遝隊，該空運隊組識有日，但因種種困難，至今未能正式開始工作，陳納德將軍昨日接見中央社記者稱：日前赴京，即爲與有關當局洽商空運事宜，曾謁風朱院長，周主委至柔，交通部俞部長等，商談結果，頗爲圓滿。陳氏又稱：渠此度來華，組織空運隊，全爲中國人民服務，協助行總善救工作之加速進行，故該機構乃行總之一部份，各方不明真相，以爲該空運隊亦是商營性質，實則該空運隊之首要工作，厥爲運輸行總之救濟物資。</p>

<p>昨日國慶，全市商店機關國旗飄揚，懸燈結彩，頗有新年氣象。馬路上人山人海，電車公共汽車搭客比沙丁魚還擠，三輪車人力車乘機抬價，短短路程，索價常在二千元以上。</p>

<p>會場中，多數要人均爲新聞記者所包圍，但最不願意發表意見的是孔祥熙，此外，沈鈞儒不斷地答覆各報記者關於時局的問話。</p>
<p>當潘公展和吳市長夫婦談話時，各報記者羣相攝影，吳市長夫人說：「把太太請來同拍」。於是潘公展夫婦及吳市長夫婦即合拍照相一幀，拍照時吳市長夫人說：「不必站得必恭必整，說說笑笑隨便點」。吳市長接着說：「自然，自然，在參議會裏我們還吵架呢」！</p>
<p>五時許，吳市長高舉酒杯，踏上音樂台，向全體來賓歡呼：「爲中華民國乾杯！爲蔣主席乾杯！」其時，由許綿淸領導之交響樂隊即合奏我國國歌，在莊嚴之樂聲中，全體肅立致敬。時夕陽西下，天空中一片紅色，光芒萬丈，象徵着中華民國的前程燦爛舞疆！</p>

<p>匪魁顧友良</p>
<h3>裕盈棧刦案破獲　捕獲大批從犯追回一部份原贓　匪魁在浦東竟有自建洋房</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市機廠街裕盈堆棧，上月廿六日夜被大批匪盜刦去呢絨七疋，馬立斯，吉而喜香烟百五十九箱，歷兩小時始去。是案發生後，經蓬萊警分局長姚啓洪，副分局長陸更生，親率股員楊冕之，警長張書生馳往察勘，認爲盜匪搶刦方法極爲笨拙，似爲扛夫與船夫串同所爲。遺偵騎　出查探，同時宣局長對此案頗爲重視，於本月二日限令，必須於十天內破案。七日午夜得密報，謂關橋碼頭菊花理髮店主陶金元，有收藏是案贓物等情。遂由承辦警長張書生報吿上峯，夤夜出發搜查，果在陶之店內，抄得原贓呢絨二疋，幷將店主逮捕帶局。經姚分局長親自偵訊，得悉盜黨搶刧之後，曾在關橋大利輪船公司碼頭起岸。當時由預謀匪魁顧友良，（綽號小裕實，在浦東有自建洋房，手下黨羽甚衆）偕綽號大獅子，大李順子等三人親自指揮，將貨物分裝兩卡車，運往北京西路某烟紙店，卸下一部份贓物。繼又駛至普安路常德里一五二號。因該屋狹小，乃又轉運至山海關路某豆腐店暫行寄藏。約三小時後，將該贓物脫售與山東中路七號陳萬興烟紙店。嗣由分局長派原辦人員，於昨晨秘密渡浦，先將匪魁顧友良（五十歲，見岡）逮捕。繼又將銷贓烟紙店主及涉嫌之掮運扛夫許實海，周木龍，杭彭德，金三小，金元福，周阿三暨共犯大獅子，大李順子等，先後捕獲主從犯及嫌犯約二十餘名。追回原贓香烟數十小條，及已被剪碎之呢絨三疋。刻正聲請寄押，聽候偵查，續緝餘黨中。</p>

<h3>方治發表時局意見　國大爲憲政階梯　希望各黨派以國家爲重　集中制憲討論勿逞意氣</h3>
<p>記者頃走訪市黨部新任主任委員方治氏，詢以時局問題，承見吿如下：</p>
<p>一，國民大會期前準備事項有何意見？</p>
<p>答：國民大會召開之前，希望各黨派以國家利益爲重，早日促成實施民主黨政，奠定國家長治久安之基礎。切勿以其他枝節問題，而使國家之根本大法無法制定。至於期前準備事項，端在各方意見融洽，集中於制憲的討論，絕對站在國家利益的立塲，不逞絲毫意氣。即使憲草內容有所爭執，亦須由國民大會最後決定．</p>
<p>二，對憲政憲法有何意見？</p>
<p>答：國家統一與政治民主實爲今日全國人民一致的要求，所以推行憲政爲今日急不容緩之事，而開國民大會，實爲國家進入民主憲政的階梯。憲政之開創，首須制定國家根本大法，保障人民自由。一切政黨均可在憲法之下，作政治之活動。憲法是國家之根本大法，必須外合國際潮流，內適人民需要。憲法的最高精神，在於實現牽制與均衡的原則，亦即權能分開的理論。使人民有權，政府有能。國家大政，悉以民意爲依歸，今日對憲法爭執之點，不在憲法之根本原則，而在運用三權與五權之方式，與總統制和內閣制之異同。但衡以國家需要與歷史體騐，股各國行政之利弊而言，五權憲法實爲中國最適宜之政制。而行使權能分開原則與美國行政之實效，互相比較，自以總統制爲最適當。</p>
<p>三，對大局有何意見？</p>
<p>答：今日國際需要和平，國內需要統一，這是天經地義，任何人不能否認。國際間能實現和平，則慘痛的第三次世界大戰不至發生；國內能實現統一，則實施民主憲政，乃能有望。本黨五十年的革命奮鬭，業已奠定國家獨立統一的强固基礎。任何國民皆不願再起紛亂，以動搖民族的獨立，國家的統一。共產黨人如仍採取革命手段，企圖以武力奪取政權，不僅違反全國國民的意志，抑且影響國際的和平，決非中國人民乃至世界人類的期望。大戰之後，療痍未復，國家經不起戰禍，人民受不了犧牲，而且事實上亦等不得共產革命。主席一再宣示：以政治方法解決國內紛爭。只要共產黨人能忠實執行政協決議，參加政府實行　編，以黨人論政風度，在國民大會與各級民意機關公開討論，放棄戰塲上之流血，則國家之長治久安，政治上之民主自由，不難獲致。是誠國家之大幸，世界和平之大幸。</p>
<h3>上海青年館昨揭幕　盛大體育活動表演</h3>

<p>團體表演</p>
<p>體育活動，計有球類賽，團體表演，及田徑賽等，團體表演上午有現代體育館及上海健身學院之鐵槓鈴運動法，與健美體格表演等，靑年會之西洋拳擊，精武體育會之摔角比賽，與雙槓表演，均極精彩，下午一時起，賡續有格致中學之健美操，疊羅漢，紹興中學之雙槓，及疊羅漢，澄衷中學之跳箱，及市立體專之墊上運動，及女生戈舞，表演精彩，博得掌聲不少。靑年練比賽，參加者七校，結果第一緝槻，第二南洋模範，第三紹興中學，大家努力（即拔河）比賽結果，第一育才，第二澄衷，第三民立。</p>

<p>十時起，男籃表演，綠林對V隊，V隊前半以十一對九領前，結果綠林以廿四對廿反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>田徑項目</p>
<p>下午二時田徑賽，項目七種，六分團談清獲百米及四百米雙料冠軍，因跑道關係，成績未見出色，千五百米啞吧獨佔鰲頭，四分卅四秒二。跳高南洋模範藍健壓倒張邦倫得第一，一米五九。標槍參加者僅三人，六分國王學武五十二米三五之成績，奪得首席。</p>

<h3>答復讀者</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）巧取　奪</p>
<p>浦時之間　某業三十三年春季創設以來，巧立名目，向職員收取定職金，每名收僞券五千元，（當時約値白米兩石餘）全體職工之定職金幾達該廠全部資本五分之一，言明三個月後即可歸還，在保管期內給息五厘，屆期延不發還。直至去年八月初，廠主藉敵僞勢力仍以五千元發　，且不計息（約值大餅五枚）當時因格於情勢，忍痛收回，茲者天日重光，正義得伸，全體職工擬向資方提出賠償要求以交納時之米價作偽標準，並追返利息，是否合法，又侍應生是否能列爲該業全體職員之一？該業在三十三年度獲利僞幣數萬萬元，照該廠章提出紅利百廿分之八爲全體職員之獎勵金，但侍應生並未分得此項獎勵金，是否可以追索。</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）當時收回如保留賠償損害之請求，可依復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條辦理，（二三）侍應生亦係職工性質，職工如可分配紅利，則侍應生亦得請求。</p>
<p>（二）劣紳肆虐</p>
<p>尙卓立間　我父在民國十五年因生活困難，將自己的房屋一幢，以白洋四百元當於本地劣紳，期滿後該紳拒絕回贖，我們無法在三十一年向當地法院控吿，結果判令以六千五百元回贖，但該紳仍用遷延政策拒絕贖取，至本年三月，我們又請求原判法院强制執行，結果我們向法院交了六千五百元，在強制執行後收回房屋，而該紳不服，提起上訴，於五月底判決，「原判決撤銷被吿應以六十五萬元向原吿贖房，」讀者雖略知法律，但不懂這神妙的判決，請先生賜以解釋，有無挽救的方法？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕所詢增加贖價，或係依司法院二十五年院解字第三一二五號解釋及復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條請求法院判決，如不服，可於法定期間內提起上訴。</p>

<h3>促進僑匯　擬准以原幣匯兌　黑市不消滅發生了阻礙　紐約爲最多南洋已稅減</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪中國銀行，探詢該行辦理僑匯業務情形。據悉：近來僑匯情形，並無顯著進境。蓋因官價匯率，與外幣黑市價格，發生差額。而一般人心理，對外幣價格，又多看好。故均望能以原幣匯返祖國。惟如經由該行承匯，其匯款多在匯出地即予折合法幣數額。故各地僑匯，遂多以原幣匯往香港。現該行有鑒及此，正考慮舉辦原幣匯款辦法，期因此而挽回鉅額之僑匯資金。惟此一辦法施行時，對中央銀行之外匯管理，不無相當窒礙。刻正研究其克服之方案，以便及時施行。</p>
<p>在本年三月外匯市場開放以前，僑匯業務之經營，全集中該行一家。外匯開放後，各指定經營處匯業務之銀行，亦得同時經營，惟數額不多。據估計：該行所承匯之僑胞匯款，至少佔全國僑匯總額二分之一。在復員初期，該行辦理僑匯，曾因電信交通未復常態，且由紐約匯交廣東四邑之款項，尚須經重慶或上海總行承轉，故匯款費時，在所不免。惟自本年起，信匯已可不由總行承轉。又自本年六月廿八日起，已恢復紐約電匯。故現由紐約來電，兩三日即可抵達該。收款人自匯出日起，三四日即可收款。即以紐約與廣東四邑各地之電匯言，計時亦僅八日左右可到。</p>
<h3>匯款統計</h3>
<p>至各地僑匯數額，戰前向以南洋各屬居首位。茲以英屬南洋呼地，對僑匯限制甚嚴。荷屬南洋名地，因受戰事影響，僑匯幾全停頓。復以南洋各地多受軍事影響，僑胞損失慘重，幾瀕於破產階段。故復員後該一地區之匯款，遂告銳減。本年八月來，各地僑匯數額，以紐約（包括加拿大及美洲本部）居首位，約占該行僑匯總額百分之八十強。次爲倫敦（包括英國本部），古巴，奧洲，菲律賓，印度，緬甸，新加坡，吉隆坡，檳榔嶼，河內等地。茲將該行本年八月來逐月承匯</p>
<p>僑匯數額，分誌於後：</p>
<p>一月份　二、一八一、八三二、五五四元</p>
<p>二月份　一、〇六五、二八〇、四九七</p>

<p>本年度會計年度即將終了，全國稅收情形良好，關稅一項，原定一千億，今可收達三千億，其他各種稅收亦可足額，入超問題，外匯更變後已好轉，八月底入超已經減少云。</p>

<h3>窰府觀光</h3>
<p>— 九月廿八日浮梁訊　本報特約記者俞寧頗擄</p>
<p>乍臨窰府，驟視外貌，是繁榮與富庶；但如果一窺繁榮背後的篳路藍縷，却已深藏着衰退頹敗的暗影。</p>
<p>景德爲吾國四大鎭之一，隸治贛北浮梁，亦爲江西內地唯一的鉅埠，自民廿一年經五區專署督飭大規模的修整後，街面的繁榮，遠過九江，奢靡的風，市容的壯，均足比屑省會的南昌。記者由靜穆蕭條約農村，乍　此地，意境爲之一新。烟囪矗立，繚繞如雲，示它　廠的多；市屋　比，衢人肩摩，示它戶口的衆，娛樂塲所，飲食館肆，無不是座客常滿，暄　達旦，又明示瓷鎭人士揮霍的豪華。</p>
<p>城郭猶是人事已非</p>
<p>記者在民十一年駐景承辦滬報推銷，對往識的珠山面目，渴別了已二十多年，這次觀光窰府，大有丁令威化鶴歸來，城郭猶是，人民巳非之概。但是鎭無城郭，僅於接連鎭郊的里村，剩有荒凉其有城門式的雉堞磚堡半座，其他原有民房，大部都變了洋房，泥濘傾斜的街路，也都變了寬闊洋灰的馬路，昔時輪廓，今巳不復存在。</p>
<p>陌生人乍臨窰府，　觀外貌的繁榮，沒有不羨說是特產富庶之區，如果一去窺它繁榮背後的　路藍縷，却已深藏着衰退頹敗的不少事實，這江西腹地唯一的重鎭，所賴以滋養生發的惟瓷器，說起瓷器兩字，無論是國內外人土，都知道景德瓷器爲最著名，以名聞天下的景瓷，又爲一地獨有的特產品，供全國及歐美諸邦的需要，當然是求過於供，業務自成蒸蒸日上，何至於還愁銷路上的滯塞，返退走入頹敗的衰途呢？這裏面又含蘊了多種複雜致衰的原因在，記者不敢自詡作明朗的透視，只可當走馬看花式的掠察一過，而摭拾過去和現在的情狀，大概寫在下面：</p>
<p>景瓷產運全面探溯</p>
<p>陶瓷是由礦土制作燒煉而成，我國製造陶瓷，濫觴於上古，通鑑有：「黃帝命寗封爲陶正」之事；史記有：「舞陶於河濱」。的記載，漢代鄒陽賦有云：「醪釀既成。綠瓷是啓。」因知漢代已有釉彩之飾。景德瓷器，是濫臨於何代，是很難以稽考，據浮梁縣志云：「新平冶陶，始於漢世，」六朝時代，陳至德二年，大建富殿於建康，詔新平以陶礎貢，雕巧而弗堅。考新平即景德鎭，可知景瓷在技術上，六朝已有可觀。</p>
<p>瓷土的種類有十三（一）東港釉果，（二）明砂高嶺，（三）星子高嶺，（四）祁門瓷土，（五）壽溪瓷土，（六）樂平瓷土，（七）貴溪瓷土，（八）餘干瓷土，（九）安仁瓷土，（十）臨川瓷土，（十一）三實蓬瓷土，（十二）銀坑塢瓷土，（十三）陳灣瓷土，（子）東港釉果。產於浮梁屬的東鄕窰里，距鎭一百十華里，（丑）明砂高嶺，產於浮梁東鄉高嶺，距鎮九十華里，（寅）星子瓷土，產於星子縣，距鎭四百餘里，（卯）祁門資土，產於安徽祁門東南西三路，距鎭四五十里不等，（辰）壽溪瓷土產浮梁東鄕壽溪，距鎭六十華里，（已）樂平瓷土產樂平南鄕黑林　村水路，距鎭三百五十華里，（午）貴溪瓷土產貴溪縣，距鎭三百四十里，（未）餘干瓷土產餘干縣，距鎭二百八十里，（辛）安仁瓷土產餘江縣距鎭三百華里，（酉）臨川資土和貴溪，餘干，安仁，瓷土，都屬做坯的用，（戊）三寳蓬，銀坑塢，陳灣，三處瓷土，均產浮梁，距鎭三五十里至七八十里，產量甚豐。</p>
<p>景鎭位居江西的東北，浮梁的西南，民國五年，縣治始遷鎭，北通秋浦，祁門，東鄰婺源，南連樂平，西接鄱陽，水道僅有昌江，發源於皖屬祁門縣北的大洪山，西南流經景鎭轉入鄱湖，惟山河水源太小，不通輪舶：衹賴帆船和小劃駁載，在民二十年前公路未闢的時候，全鎭出產瓷器輸出，完全用舟車運輸，險阻艱難，實爲景瓷推鎖的隘障。到了民二十一年後景湖，屯景，南浮，婺景，公路，先後通車，陸路運輸，漸臻便利，民二十三年京黔幹綫景德至黃金埠一段通車與浙贛路銜接後，旅運益便，如此路全綫完成通車，於景瓷運輸和推銷，自然暢通無阻。</p>
<p>瓷器暢銷　出口總值</p>
<p>景德瓷器的銷場因爲是國內無與倫比的最著名的特產品，自不虞銷路的滯積，各方需要的，近遍本國各省，遠及南洋歐美諸邦，各瓷廠製出產品，向來不自行運銷於各地，全賴各地客帮駐鎭採辦，各埠常川駐鎭辦瓷的有天津，廣州，關東，同信，同慶，黃麻，馬口，三邑，良子，孝感，過山，湖南，河南，寗紹，川湘，桐城，豐西，北平，揚州，金斗，南昌，九江，內河，康山，靑島，山東，新加坡，暹羅等在二十餘帮。</p>
<p>最盛的時期，全鎭有窰廠三千餘座，從業瓷工達十餘萬人，瓷器輸出總値，年有六七千萬兩以上，淸同治三年，瓷器輸出量，有六萬六千餘担，光緒三年只有一萬一千三百餘担，宣統三年，復增五萬九千七百餘担，民國三年，又增至六萬六千六百餘担，至民十八年，更增至十二萬七千八百六十餘担，二十二年又降至五萬四千七百餘担，輸出總値，不足四百萬元，二十二年以後雖略有增加，仍無多大起色，抗戰八年中，因途運的艱阻，整個瓷業，幾陷停頓，抗戰勝利一年來，窰廠雖曾一度恢復舊觀，努力生產，不久又趨於靜閑休止的狀態，珠山高處不勝寒，也被深秋的凉風吹得懶洋洋地似帶有肅瑟的秋意和懨　的倦容。</p>
<p>降至淸代，設景德鎭御器廠，乾隆時內務府員外郞唐英督造御窰廠，鳩工萃能，研精抉巧，當時各廠競技鬥美，日異月新，國內和南洋各埠，銷行極暢，遂成景瓷的鼎盛時代。</p>
<p>瓷窰廠家門類複雜</p>
<p>瓷器窰廠，門類複雜，就它工塲的簡稱區別，有窰廠店三種，製造瓷坏厘缽的日廠，司燒煉瓷器的稱窰，飾彩瓷器花色的稱紅店，再就它營業性質區分，有製瓷·燒窰·彩繪·匣缽·絞草五業，其中（甲）屬於圓器類的有（一）四大器業（二）二白釉業（三）脫胎業（四）飯閉業（五）四冬小器業（六）可器灰渣器業（七）古器業（八）酒合盅業（九）七五寸業，（乙）屬於琢器類的有（一）大件業（二）粉定業（三）雕削業（四）官蓋業（五）淡描業（六）滑石業（七）針匙業（八）湯匙業（九）古壜業（十）燈盞業（十一）博古器業。（丙）屬於燒窰業的，（一）柴窰業（二）槎窰業（丁）屬於彩繪類的（一）寫意彩業（二）粉古彩業（三）美術彩業（四）黃家洲飾瓷業（戊）（一）大器匣缽業（二）小器匣缽業。</p>
<p>各行的職工，（子）屬於圓器類的有司事，打雜·做坯·利坯·上釉·副坯·藝徒·伙夫，（丑）屬於燒窰的，有把莊·挖坏·架抄·收兜脚·　匣·小火手·三夫半·二夫半·一夫半·車匣·屑工·挑夫·管事，（寅）屬於燒槎窰廠的，有把莊·做重·打大搥·收砂帽·　匣缽·小火手·紅半股·黑半股·打雜·管事·藝徒·數槎·挑槎·管窰，（卯）屬於彩繪的，有職工·畫工·施色，（辰）屬於匣缽的，有推工·配土·做匣匠，（己）屬於紋草業的，有整艸·包裝·採藍·打雜·挑運，總共以上諸業，在民廿二年前，有二千八百餘家，廿三年以後降至一千零六十家。</p>
<p>至關製瓷·施釉·及飾彩的經過手續至夥，如（甲）製瓷方法，（子）坯土配製·（一）配合（二）練泥·（丑）製坯·（一）陶車做坯（二）印坏（三）利坏（四）上釉（五）鷥坏（六）補水（七）雕鑲製坏（八）模形製坏（九）鑄入製坏（十）防燥·（寅）匣缽燒窰·製缽有煉泥·切片·陶東編型·耐火分度·燒窰有堆砌·排列·配火·搶火·溜火·緊火·緩燒大小·出窰。（乙）施釉有二種·（一）白釉（二）顏色釉·施釉方法·又分（一）蘸釉（二）盪釉（三）澆釉（四）塗釉（五）吹釉·（丙）飾彩有二種·（一）靑花（二）彩花·靑花有霽靑·豆靑冬靑數種，彩花有　紅·胭脂紅·頂紅·中紅·廣翠·頂翠·金翠·翡翠·爐均翠·玻璃白·老黃·上黃·大綠·苦綠·烏金·古大綠·本地綠·膠水料·細粉料·珠明料。本金·古銅·補白·雪白·甘靑·黑料·赫色·洋金·西洋赤·西洋紅·等三十餘種，施彩方法，又分（一）圈塡法（二）繪描法（三）貼花法（四）印花法（五）劃花法（六）吹色法（七）拍色法。</p>
<p>製窰原料需要孔多</p>
<p>製瓷的原料，有窰柴和瓷土兩種，景鎭窰柴，完全以松柴和茅柴爲燃料，松柴需要極多，茅柴較少，松柴的來源，（一）由　源祁門等處採伐沿昌江下運，自山裝鎭，（二）由餘江·餘干·樂平·星子·都昌·彭澤·湖口·臨川·導處自運往鄱陽溯昌江而上，近的百餘里，遠的數百里，有保柴公所，專帮密戶協辦柴料。</p>
<p>瓷業頹勢尚難挽回</p>
<p>國內唯一特產的瓷器，有年輸出六七千萬兩以上的總値，有十餘萬從業的瓷工，更引入了不遠千里而來的各帮瓷客，窰廠店分門行業，又各是的繁夥，完全是一無管理業務自由的分組手工業，總合起來，範圍不能算是狹隘，營業不能算是稀微，這種分工合作的大企業，在有組織，有管理，有技術，有辦法的公司工廠，常有勞資糾紛的傾軋，甚至罷工職業的事件發生，何况這裏面的無經濟組織，牢守陋規不樂遷善，不予客便，不廣招徠，不求改進的分組手工業呢？勞資傾軋，同業鬥爭，還是當然的事實，然因爲瓷業，是無管理的自由工業，它的衰敗危機，亦就暗藏在裏面，諸般不合理不適時足以致本業的弱點，俱亦裸裸的曝顯出來了！</p>
<p>此其咎並不在原有的瓷商瓷工，整個瓷業的頹勢，又非一般瓷商瓷工的力量所能挽回的，以記者的視察所得，現在瓷業的失敗，歸結說起來，有下面各點：（一）缺乏政府力量的帮助，（二）缺乏指導管理機關，（三）資力過於薄弱，（四）技術方面的幼稚，（五）交通運輸的不便，（六）人事的不適宜，（七）瓷工太流動，生活不安定，（八）急功近利，求效太速，（九）陋習太深，引人厭亞，（十）無一定標準的正常市價，有此十因，致景德瓷業，祇有日趨於狹隘的側徑上踽行，自難轉步光明坦途的希望了。</p>
<h3>秋到南國</h3>
<p>— 六日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>秋至矣！在溫暖的南國，雖然晚上也吹起了陣陣的秋風，但白天還是酷日當空，有如夏末。祇有對季節最敏感的小姐們，却早已換上各式的秋季旗袍，披上了薄薄的小外套，這彷彿是秋天降臨人間的警號；而商人們對季節的嗅覺也不見得遲鈍，他們早已爲秋來而準備好一切：百貨商店的玻璃窗櫉上，陳列着不少毛線，手套，薄呢衣料之類應時的日用品；洋服店亦將「沙士堅」除下面換上了從大洋船運到的各式各樣的秋呢；飲冰室更早已改行買餛飩麵了！連黃金和港幣都好像受到節令的轉變而影響一般，不斷的掀起浪潮；港紙在一週間從七五零跳到九三零，黃金也從二十七萬而至二十八萬幾，因而牽動了物價都跟着尾賽跑，使人們感受到秋的降臨，是有着一番新的刺激，加上一重新的威脅。</p>
<p>也許由於金融波動而使物價牽動增高的緣故吧，一般人的生活，都達到一天困難比一天；又由於生活困難，社會秩序便日形混亂。廣州復員已一年多了！照理，一切都應該漸上軌道，且慢說要大衆能够得到休養生息，大概最低限度也不應該如目前這樣困難了吧！在復員初期，市政當局的一連串計劃，雖然還未實現，但大家總算得到精神的安慰，寄予無限的期望；可是這柴計劃今天却已變成「空頭支票」，市民都感到失望了！不是嗎？我們極目現在的廣州，眞是無一是處，先談治安吧：雖然警察當局已盡到最大的努力，每天都加派大隊的警察巡邏，公共汽車也隨時搜查，可是搶劫案依然不斷的發生；每天報章上的社會新聞版，如「持械强搶」「剝死牛」「入屋行刧」「斯文賊搶手袋」之類的刺眼的題目，起碼有三段至五段。現在祇不過是秋天，治安已是如此；很快的冬天便要降臨，冬天是治安最難維持的季節，何况在這生活日艱，難免有些人會經不起凍餒壓迫而挺而走險，那時搶劫案更多，市民的生命財產，更難得到保障了！</p>
<p>在「交通安全運動」聲中，汽車肇事幾乎成爲廣州日常的課題。汽車輾死人還不算，竟然有不少駛上行人路和撞毀交通警察的崗亭。最高紀錄的汽車肇事，在一天之內發生達四宗之多，而且肇事後司機多數是被逃的；市民走在路上無不人人自危，報章上的紛紛呼籲當局採取有效辦法，但當局仍未有正式表示，大概「交通安全運動」，祇是一張標語而已！所以有一位記者建議，爲策市民安全計，馬路兩旁，應該加築短牆，或把行車道劃定挖深一二尺，以防汽車超越。這建議雖屬幽默論調，但照目前廣州交通很亂的情形，似乎舍此實無其他辦法了。</p>
<p>有人說，汽車失事之多，馬路不平未嘗不是原因之一；那你也許會問，馬路爲什麼不把它修好呢？這問題已由本市的工務局長陳國機明白的答覆了。他說：「由於經費無措，卅五年度本局之計劃，到現在大部份仍未舉辦，如陳市長（前市長陳策）親自計劃開闢之環市馬路等大計劃，空成泡影，其次則有歷史性之海珠大橋，其破爛程度已屆危險時期，蓋橋基已有傾斜狀態，若本年底不能全部修補時，則短期內將禁一切車輛行駛，以免發生危險，最近歐陽市長曾商港方，請借用修理器具，已蒙答允，但仍待經費有着，方能興工。」所以要將馬路修築，當然有待於經費有着了。</p>

<h3>現代醫學上的消化性潰瘍治療（一）</h3>
<p>— 薛邦祺</p>
<p>提到消化性潰瘍這個名詞（包括胃潰痬和十一一指腸潰瘍），誰都曉得是一個不易根治的慢性疾病。由於消化器官機構上和功能上的特殊，它是日夜不斷的工作，日夜不斷的分泌，外加對於神經，精神，或任何外界的刺激特別敏感，因此消化性潰瘍的浩療，決非一般人所想像的那樣簡單。在治療之前，我們要看到病人的環境，要明瞭病人的心緒，要探研疾病的根源，還要詳察病人體內其他各部各系統的現狀，對症發藥，或先根洽病源，或先支柱體力；或先平息徵象，按其重要，依理據情，一步一步的處理着。主治的醫生，不但要有豐富的學識，還要很機敏的顧到各種因素，循之入範。所以機械式的刻板治療方法，往往難付實際應用。不過醫學上有公諷的原理，我們必須要認淸原理，握住要着，按個別病情的不同，給它適當的治療方法。</p>
<p>消化性潰瘍的治療原則，可以分作下面幾類討論：</p>
<p>（甲）一般治療</p>
<p>一般治療是任何疾病都需要的。消化性潰瘍是慢性疾病，更占着重要的地位。它是治療成功之先決條件，應該列在首頁，先作檢討：</p>
<p>（一）身心休養</p>
<p>治療之道，休息第一。這是古今中外醫界的經律。不過休息這個名詞；是指身心兩方面而論；體力上的保養是外形的，比較容易辦到；惟心神休養，是精神心理上的，往往難以實行。病人必須抱着樂觀的信念；因爲精神上的不安定，挹　，和刺激，很容易波及敏感的胃腸，使它受着嚴重的反嚮。舉一個明顯的例子：我們在吃飯的時候，如果忽然來了一個不幸的消息，我們就會之刻感覺胃部呆　，食慾消失，這是胃腸波及　力　　刺激後的反嚮。</p>
<p>（二）局部休息</p>
<p>這個休息，包括避免外界對胃腸局部的顚動，寒冷，或其他物理刺激，以及設法减少或規節胃　之分泌及收縮工作，給一個有病的器官，多些歇息機會。這個需要是很明顯的，可以無庸贅述。</p>
<p>（三）消絕體內病　傳染</p>
<p>體內任何部份之病竃傳染及其不斷的毒素散佈，可以引起消化性潰痬之發生或增加其病狀之嚴重性。所以我們在治療期間，必須詳細檢查其他系統有無病竃傳染之存在。無論是扁桃腺發炎，　炎，慢性闌尾炎或婦女骨盆內種種發炎症，及其他各系統之慢性症候，均須在可能範圍內一一根治，以免貽害。</p>
<p>（四）排除體內各種毒素</p>
<p>體內任何部位如有毒素發現，譬如便閉所致的腸內毒素，務必隨時設法排除之，不可忽略。病人之大便，宜每日通暢，便閉時可以用灌腸等方法排出之。對於個人感敏或易起不良反應之飲食，如螃蟹等時鮮食品，亦宜忌却爲妙。</p>
<p>（五）個人衛生</p>
<p>個人之日常生活，應有規節。起居寒暖，陽光空氣，及其他淸潔衛生諸問題，亦宜注意，它們對於病程都有密切的影饗。</p>
<p>（乙）胃酸中和治療及飮食調理</p>
<p>（薛佩氏Sippy療法）</p>
<p>胃酸中和，是近代消化性潰瘍最普遍應用之治療方法。首創者薛佩氏（Dr．Berteam　W．Sppy）他認爲消化性潰瘍痊愈的障碍。主因在胃酸對於胃黏膜或十二指腸粘膜，起有分解及消化作用。胃酸首先損毀胃腸局部粘膜之血液循環，然後營養斷絕，抵抗力消失，致發生潰蝕情形。我們若能控制胃酸，使之中和，則胃腸之潰痬，亦能漸漸愈合。</p>
<p>薛佩氏根據以上原理，他策劃了治療消化性潰瘍的三大原則：（一）胃酸中和（二）飲食調理（三）胃積灌洗。在這個原則下治療，他確信潰痬可以漸漸愈合，生理功能可以漸漸復元。</p>
<p>近二十餘年來：各國醫界對於消化性潰瘍之療法，曾努力作大規模研究。所得結果，雖見解有異，惟綜合一般而論，大體均與薛佩氏之理論及療法相符。是故薛佩氏療法，仍爲今日醫界所取法，僅依病情之不同，略作更改而矣。</p>
<p>（一）胃酸中和</p>
<p>許佩氏以檢性粉劑，作胃酸中和之主要藥品。此類粉劑有兩種：第一種爲重質氧化鎂〇·六公分及重炭酸鈉〇·六公分之混合分劑，第二種爲炭酸　（或炭酸鈣）〇·六公分及重炭酸鈉一·二至一·〇公分之混合粉劑。服法於兩餐之間，輸流服第一種或第二稱粉各一劑量。</p>
<p>薛佩氏粉劑對於中和作用甚有效騐。其中之氧化　炭酸　，可以用作調節大便之用，前者通便，後者止瀉。</p>
<p>關於消化性潰痬鹼性藥物的選擇，現代醫界亦有很詳細的研究。歷來認爲最理想最標準的鹼性樂物，應具有下列條件：（一）胃液內不能溶解（二）對於腸胃無刺激性（三）成混懸勻液時保持中和性，但可以中和酸液（四）對於體內之酸　平衡無改變影響（五）日常所服用之劑量，不致將尿轉成强烈　性而使燐屬結晶體沈澱於腎臟或尿道各處（六）無便閑或腸瀉作用（七）無轉變其他新陳代謝作用。</p>
<p>在這種條件之下，我們認爲薛佩氏應用之重炭酸鈉未能完全滿意。它能溶解於水，服之過多或過久能發生酸中毒之危險，並且如Chamberlin及Lookwood氏之報吿，謂服重炭酸鈉以後，可以續發生胃酸分泌作用。由於以上的種種事實，我們可以詳察個別病情，酌量以炭酸鈣代出重炭酸納，避免一部份的不良反應。</p>
<p>（二）飲食調理</p>
<p>消化性潰瘍之飲食調理，大多亦取法於薛佩氏。它的主要條件，是給病人以豐足之營養而無胃腸刺激性。所以有規則的多餐少量，是一個理想的方法。食物的選擇，以滋補，柔軟而無刺激性者爲限。同時並須輸流服用鹼性藥物，使胃酸中和。</p>
<p>我們祗可以策劃一個很簡單的食譜綱。至於飲食品類及份量的詳細分配或增减之速度，只可視病人之症狀，酌情辦理。嚴格的飲食調節，至少應該有三個至六個星期的時期。</p>
<p>消化性潰瘍診斷確定以後。起初兩天可以飲三兩左右生奶及乳酪各半之混合飲料。從早上七時起至晚上七時止，每小時一次。在前後飲食之間，必須以薛貝氏之兩種粉劑，輸流各服一劑量。兩天以後，如經過情形良好，則於上午飲食時，可以酌加沙打餅干或土司一次。於下午飲食時，可加少量稀粥或麥片一次。從此可按照病情，續日酌加柔軟單純而無刺激性之飮食少許。滿一星期後，病人之飲食，除每次三兩之牛奶乳酪以外，每天可加雞蛋二三只（冲蛋或各式嫩蛋均可），稀粥或麥片或煨麵二三次，惟每次以二三兩爲限。不慣飲牛乳的病人，可以用豆腐漿或其他滋補流汁間隔替代。如是再隔一二星期後，病人之飲食，每日可以分作五餐或六餐。許多食物，如麵包。白麵饅頭，泥碎之魚，雞，或菜葉，粥，麵，及煮過之水菓等，均可列入食譜矣。</p>
<p>（三）胃積灌洗</p>
<p>胃積灌洗法對於幽門阻寒而呈飲食潴留情形之病例最爲有益。每天臨睡時灌洗一次，可以出清當天胃中潴留之一切酸性積食而减少潰痬接觸胃酸之時間。醫務上我們可以把潴留物做一個酸性試騐，作爲鹼性藥物劑量增减之參考。在病人方面，經過灌洗以後，當晚可以很舒適的睡息。</p>
<h3>談狂犬病</h3>
<p>— 蕭文炳</p>
<p>適當預防可使此病絕跡</p>
<p>狂犬病又名瘓咬病或恐水病，是一種熱血動物的傳染病。此病犬類最易傳染，其他如狼，狐狸，貓等亦可感染；人類被瘋狗（瘋貓或瘋狼等）咬後，可得此病。據一般統計，人類被瘋狗咬後，並非盡得此症。百名之中，約占十六人左右，孩童却比成人易於傳染。此病歐美各國均有，但至今公共衛生先進國家，處以適當預防，已幾乎絕跡，我國患者尙多，足見預防方法，尙未盡力推行，茲將狂犬病之病原，傳染途徑，病理，病狀及診斷，略加討論，並詳述預防方法，以供參考：</p>
<p>（一）病原及其傳染途徑：其病原爲一種濾過性病毒，存在於患者之神經系統及睡腺內，唾液即爲此病傳染之媒介，由創口或粘膜傳至神經系統所致。該濾過性毒，易爲消毒藥品，陽光及高溫殺死。</p>
<p>（二）病理：其重要病理變化，均在神經系統；腦部及育髓膜常現充血現象及出血點，在小腦，大腦，橋腦，脊髓及唾腺內，可以找到內基氏體（Negri），並且在血管及神經細胞之周圍，有很多白血球增積，尤其在動神經節之細胞四周爲更多。</p>
<p>（三）症狀：潛伏期（由接觸傳染至病狀發生之期謂之潛伏期）之長短，與下列幾點有關係：</p>
<p>（Ａ）創傷之位置　凡創傷距離腦部愈近者，其潛伏期愈短。普通頭面部最短，上肢次之，下　更次之。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）毒質的量與强度　凡毒量愈多和毒質愈强，其潛伏期愈短，反是，則潛伏期愈長。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）創口的大小和深淺凡傷口愈大或愈深，其潛伏期愈短；倘創口僅傷及表面，或有衣服遮蔽之處，其潛伏期愈長。</p>
<p>人類被瘋狗咬後，大都在　星期至八星期之間發病，最短者爲八日，最取長者爲一二年不等。其主要症狀有二：（一）意識錯亂，（二）麻痺。臨床上可分篇三期：</p>
<p>（Ａ）第一期爲先兆期　毒素入體處之創傷，大半迅速痊愈，且所生瘢痕，並無不舒適的感覺。在先兆期創傷處常有麻木或痛癢的感覺。患者時感煩躁，神志不安，易怒，頭痛，失眠，喉緊，聲普變啞及下嚥困難，體溫略高，一二日後即入興奮期。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）第二期爲興奮期患者極度不安，呈恐怖狀態。咽喉肌特別過敏，患者雖渴，每次試飲，咽喉部肌肉即發生痙攣，不能下嚥。有時見到飲料，或聽到流水的聲音，咽喉肌即發生痙攣，似怕水狀，故名恐水病。外界輕度的刺激，亦可發生局部或全身痙攣。不在痙攣時期，患者神志，還是淸醒，痛苦萬分。體溫常較第一期爲高，有高至攝氏四十度以上者，偶而亦有不發熱者。在此時期，患者常因精力衰竭而死亡，不然，二三日後，即至麻痺期。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）第三期爲麻痺期患者漸趨安定，痙攣終止，漸入昏迷及全身麻痺狀態，數小時內，終因心臟衰竭而死亡，病的全程，約共四五日。</p>
<p>（四）診斷　此病診斷，在病發作後，並不困難；患者有被狗咬的歷史及咽喉肌陣攣性症狀，即可確定。倘若該犬在十日內無其他原因而死亡，更可無疑。</p>
<p>（五）治療病發後，患者必歸死亡，無一倖免，故一切治療，注重在症狀方面，給以多量之　靜劑，以改少患之痛苦，同時將患者隔離，以免傷及旁人。故患者被瘋狗咬後，千萬不可相信各稱士法及草藥治療，以生命爲兒戲，應速送醫院，加以預防注射，可免發病而死之虞。</p>
<p>（六）預防　預防可分爲積極與消極預防，在推行積極預防之國家，該病早已絕跡，施行消極預防，可免疾病發生而减少死亡率。</p>
<p>（Ａ）積極預防　我國各地野犬充斥，不僅妨礙交通，而且爲狂犬病的媒介，傷害人命，所以對于無主的野犬，應當從速捕殺；對于有主的家犬，要令犬主向地方公安局請領牌照，掛在犬的頭頸上，便與野犬區別。家犬出外的時候，要帶嘴套，以免咬人，若家犬不掛牌照出外，也要捕捉。家犬發生了狂犬病，應即刻把牠殺死。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）消極預防人被犬咬後，務須設法把犬捉住，證明該犬是否瘋狗；同時局部創傷之處，施行急救治療，倘使該狗有瘋犬可能，應立即注射巴斯德（Pasteur）預防菌苗。</p>
<p>瘋狗之鑑別法有二：</p>
<p>（Ａ）將該犬隔離，　之數日，以觀察有無此病，倘犬患有此病，普通在十天內即死亡。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）將該狗殺死，檢查其腦內有無內基氏體，倘若發現，即可證明該狗患有此病。或者將狗之延體液接種于荷蘭豚之大腦內，如爲瘋狗，則荷蘭豚于九至十二日即現病象。</p>
<p>局部治療　將咬傷處消毒，以熱鐵燒灼或濃硝酸烙灼傷口，或用純石炭酸腐蝕被咬處之組織，以殺死濾過性毒。</p>
<p>巴斯脫氏（Pasteur）預防注射，凡咬人之狗，有瘋狗嫌疑，應立即之射預防菌苗。此法係巴斯脫氏于民國廿九年前發明，用含毒而經特製之免脊髓按期注射之。其法係將菌苗一劑，每日在皮下注射，共十四日至二十一日，普通應用十四日。經注射後其病發數由百分之十六減至百分之一以下，其注射無效者，大部因注射太晚，或傷處太近腦部，蓋免疫力須于末次注射二星期後始能發生也。</p>
<h3>對話</h3>
<p>— 耆</p>
<p>醫生：你生什麼病？</p>
<p>病人：原不知道什麼病，所以來請敎醫生……</p>
<p>醫生：你不能適合環境，因此心理變態而患精神病。</p>
<p>病人：環境惡劣，無從適合。變態的及患精神病的該是環境吧！</p>
<p>病人：醫生應有割股之心。</p>
<p>醫生：割股之心尙可說。要是眞的割股，我們當醫生的，那來那麼多股受宰割呢？</p>
<p>醫生：依我看來，這病並不要緊。</p>
<p>病人家屬：怎麼不要緊？他是全家的財源供給者，豈可生病？</p>
<p>醫生：你生的病是URI。</p>
<p>病人：這個年頭怪病多，可是從沒有聽見過「你是我」的病症。</p>
<p>醫生：URI是U　pper　Respiratory　Infection，，即上呼吸感染，多麼嚕囌。你不曾聽見過UNRRA，CNRRA，ABMAC嗎？堪稱簡潔順口。</p>
<h3>人與病菌之戰（六）</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>摘自〔傳染病管理〕</p>
<p>（四）流行之發生與停止</p>
<p>多數人體內抵抗力降低之普通情形有三：</p>
<p>Ａ一般羣衆抵抗力之降低——此固與羣衆之營養狀况，年齡，性別，種族，職業等組合情形，有密切關係，而尤以重大的社會動態，如災荒，飢謹，戰爭等，爲最有影響。</p>
<p>Ｂ免疫人口之减少——一切流行發生後，病愈及幸免於難的人口，大都皆對此病具有相當免疫力。但人體除對少數幾種傳染病，有終身持久的免疫力外，大多逐漸消失，與時俱退。又有由於免疫人口的自然死亡或移出，以致該人羣內免疫人口的比例降低，流行即易於發生矣。</p>
<p>Ｃ具有感受性人口之增加——Topley及Greenwood等氏，嘗以動物實騐證明：移入具有感受性之動物於流行已吿停止之動物羣中，可以激發流行之再度發生。人類亦如是也：吾人在現有之環境中成長活動，多於不知不覺間，已罹染過若干臨床上所未能察覺之輕微傳染病，因而對於此等傳染病具有相當的免疫力。若一且移入新的環境中，則對於過去所未嘗經歷的傳染病，大多毫無免疫力，而極易感受。移民過衆，每足以釀成流行者，蓋此故也。又人口的自然出生，其影響亦如是。蓋初生兒並無罹染疾病的經歷，而多具有感受性也。</p>
<p>二　流行之停止</p>
<p>流行之停止，其因素質與發生者相反。茲略舉數端於後：</p>
<p>（一）關於病原及病源方面：</p>
<p>Ａ病原體毒力之降低——有若干病原體之毒力，在流行的過程中，逐漸降低，卒致不足以繼續維持其流行。</p>
<p>Ｂ病原體數量之减少——傳染病播散之速度，與病原體之數量多寡，顯有密切關係。病原體數量减少至相當限度以下，流行即可停止。如患者之死亡而掩埋，或隔離而消毒，皆大足减少病原體之數量者也</p>
<p>（二）關於傳染途徑及方法方面</p>
<p>Ａ傳播傳染病的　介物之减少</p>
<p>Ｂ傳染途徑之切斷——以上二點或由於人工所致，或由於自然的結果，要皆足使流行停止。</p>
<p>（三）關於人體抵抗力方面</p>
<p>Ａ具有感受性的人口之減少——富傳染病流行之際，病者病而死者死。其結果：具有免疫力的人口日增，而具有感受性的人口乃日减，卒致流行終於停止。</p>
<p>Ｂ一般羣衆抵抗力之增進——或由於公共衛生之推行，或由於社會意識之覺悟，營養改良，住屋改進，以及其他足以增進抵抗力之步驟的實施，流行乃吿中斷。</p>
<p>由是以觀，流行之發生也，決非偶然；流行之停止也，亦非無故。惟是傳染病之各因素，錯綜複雜，變動不定，世有研究流行之週期性及其波潮起伏者，茲不備論。姑假定病原及病源爲固定不變，則傳染途徑及人體抵抗力兩者之變動，足以決定流行之成立與否者，粗此下表：</p>
<p>傳染途徑人體抵抗力疾病情形</p>
<p>易　高　地方病</p>
<p>難　高　散發病</p>
<p>難　低　散發病</p>
<p>易　低　流行病</p>
<p>易　不定　地方病及</p>
<p>流行病相更替</p>
<p>不定　低　間或形成流行病</p>
<p>附註：此表列難易高低字眼，皆爲相對性的，幷無精確數字可列。</p>

<h3>談世界上的幾種文學獎金</h3>
<p>— 紫玉</p>
<p>在古代的希臘羅馬給與詩人最高的榮譽是月桂冠；中世紀文人，也祇由王室或貴族看中以後，予以收養，成爲御用文人；英國皇家的「桂冠詩人」，也僅不過賜以田舍。而直接以金錢給予作家作爲一種獎勵或榮譽的表現，那實在還是到二十世紀商業資本社會才產生。</p>
<p>出現在當代文壇上的文藝獎金，如瑞典的諾貝爾獎金，法國的龔果爾文學獎金，英國的霍桑文學獎金，美國的普列茲文學獎金，雖然在對於作家的年齡，國籍和作品的題材上都有特殊的限制；但以現金爲獎品則一。而其中的獎額最大，且有世界聲譽的則是諾貝爾獎金。</p>
<p>諾貝爾獎金是瑞典化學家亞菲列特，彭哈斯，諾貝爾所設立的。說起來，這眞是一件絕好的諷刺，諾貝爾是無烟火藥的發明人，是拙毀世界文明建設的大軍火製造商，可是他却又同時是獎金的設立者。也許他自知對世界罪孽太大，才爲了贖回這已成的罪惡而創設這獎金的吧！他的遺命是將他的財產撥充提倡學術的基金。諾貝爾的獎金額共五種，一名獎給物理學，一名獎給化學，一名獎給醫藥學，一名獎給有貢獻於世界和平者，一名獎給交學。關於文學獎金的標準是：「獎給文學領域內產生一種有理想傾向的最出色的作品的作家。」獎金每年頒發一次，得獎者的國籍是沒有限制的，由瑞典皇家學院決定人選，每年獎金價目按基金投資利益的多寡而定，大約總在美金四萬至五萬之間。</p>
<p>諾貝爾文學獎金的獲得，是能奠定一位作家的世界聲譽的。不過近年因在政治紛歧意見上對蘇聯的作家總含有一種成見，這也是事實。又如美國賽珍珠的獲得文學獎金，一般人也多有批評其　望不够的。</p>
<p>諾貝爾文學獎金的頒發約在每年十月間，其間審閱作品的時間也相富長。</p>
<p>法國的著名的龔果爾文學獎金，是由襲果爾兄弟遺囑用他們的遣產所設立的。因他們兄弟倆靑年時受盡法蘭西學士院的閒氣，所以決意用他們的私財組織一個襲果爾學院，專門提拔新進的作家；同時向保守的腐化的法蘭西學士院對抗。龔果爾學院是由十個委員組織成的，每年頒發文學獎金一次。他不像法蘭西學士院那樣，必須要作者自動申請作爲獎金候選人。這樣便容易弊端百出。他們的方法是從上一年的新出版物中，選出一本最好的來給獎。</p>
<p>凡是得兩龔果爾獎金的作家，他的前途很少會使人失望的。如現代法國作家巴比塞，普洛斯特，杜哈美爾，瑪爾洛等人，都是龔果爾獎金的得獎者。</p>
<p>法國還有一九〇四年由兩個婦女刋物設立的婦女文學獎金，獎額是五千法郞，獎給「法國文學中每年最佳的想像的作品」，得獎者不一定是女作家，不過給獎委員會却是完全由女性組織主持的，這是一個特點。</p>
<p>法國的文學獎金到後來就未免流於過濫，甚至大大小小，不勝枚舉。據佔計最少有八十種以上，如足球協會有什麼足球小說獎金，防止虐待生物會有動物小說獎金，大規模農場又有「葡萄獎金」或「水果獎金」等等，這一切漸漸失了文藝獎金原有的意義，成爲商品化的廣吿招徠術了。</p>
<p>英國的霍桑文學獎金，是紀念美國作家霍桑的，霍桑曾在一八五三年任美國駐利物浦的領事，是名作〔紅字〕的作者，獎金也是英國文學界對他的紀念，獎金是限制給四十一歲以下的英國作家的。</p>
<p>普列茲獎金是美國著名的文學獎金，是限給美國作家的，給獎的標準是：「這一年美國出版的能代表美國風度和品格的最完整氣概的小說」。但因爲這一種限制，却使普列茲獎金委員會碰了一次意外的釘子，一九二六年五月間，普列茲委員會發表這年的獎金獲得者是「愛羅斯密斯」長篇小說的作者辛克萊·列易士，當時的辛克萊思想正很激進，痛恨主持這獎金委員會的美國文藝學院的腐敗，他立時發表了一篇公開信，拒絕接受獎金。他說他的小說並不適合他們的標準，他們的標準也根本不足衡量一部作品的優劣，他號召同時代的作家們一致拒絕承認他們的選擇，他說只有這樣始能推進美國文學作品的品質。</p>
<p>辛克萊的信立刻哄動當時的美國女　，同時也使普列茲獎金委員會不得不將他們給獎的標準改爲「給予一年來出版的美國作家最佳的一本小說，特別是有關美國生活的。」這是世界文壇上一件很有意義的事。</p>
<p>世界上的著名的文藝獎金的情形，扼要的說，已如上述的了。返顧中國雖也曾有過幾個獎金之創設，但是這些獎金，第一獎金額少得可憐，第二主持的人選根本不適宜，脫不了一種官僚作風或者是敷衍了事。所以非使不能裨益於作家之生活或聲譽，不能達到獎披新進作家的功效；而且簡直對於文學界一點也沒有引起興趣；看了外國的獎金設立的猗盛隆東情形，中國的作家們祗有抱憾而已。</p>

<h3>川北農家</h3>
<p>— 莫宗</p>
<h3>記張恨水</h3>
<p>— 天行</p>
<p>文人小記之一</p>
<p>張恨水，是一位現代著名的章回小說家。</p>
<p>說起章回小說，是民間長普遍的讀物，最近聽說丁玲，也用了章回體寫成一部「紅鞋女妖精」，因爲牠是通俗，民衆最容易消化。</p>
<p>國內愛讀張恨水小說的，可說是很多很多，因着愛讀他的小說，同時就很想知道他的歷史，我雖沒有和他有深切的交情，可是他的身世却知通着一二，這裏，我就來簡單地介紹一下吧！</p>
<p>這位小說家今年已有五十二歲了，我於十五年前在南京會過他幾次，他有着圓圓的臉孔，適當的身材，穿着一件藍布長衫，長衫上面還添上一件馬褂，對人滿面春風，怪和氣的，談起話來聲音很宏亮，正合着一句古文『能驚四座』！</p>
<p>他是安徽潛山縣人，因着他的父親在江西做武官就遷居贛省了。幼小就死了父親，家境很窮，民國初年曾在蘇州殖邊學校讀書，終究因着貧而輟學。一度加入當時稱爲文明戲的新劇班，奔走上海漢口等地，有空寫些短文投登各報，得資聊充家用，這種生活，差不多過了五六年。</p>
<p>民國七年他進蕪湖「皖江日報」作編輯，民國九年北上入「益世報」，這以後，他在北平世界和聯合等通訊社都當過記者。十三年任「世界晚報」編輯，開始寫其處女作的「春明外史」，這部著作刋出後，就得到現在幽居息烙的張學良氏的贊當，北方靑年男女，更是熱烈的愛讀。可是他在南方，那時還不有名氣，後來錢芥塵介紹他的「啼笑因綠」在「新聞報」的「快活林」上刋登，（那時該刋還叫快活林，不叫新園林），不料却一舉而成名。從此他的小說，就風靡了全國。</p>
<p>廿四年起，他就到上海來，除爲各報擔任寫長篇外，同時編「立報」副刋的「花果山」。廿五年到南京，自辦「南京人報」。抗戰後赴渝，任「新民報」主筆。去年抗戰勝利，他重回北平，一直到現在，主持着「新民報」北平版編務，而對於國內各大報的撰著，仍是不輟。</p>
<p>他的寫作很勤，現在已出版的長篇小說有五十餘種之多，還在各報未完篇的，也有六七種，聽說他的寫稿，不擇時，不擇地，偶有小病，能在床上趕稿，許多朋友在他座中坐談時，他也依然能够寫稿不息，這種精神，是普通人所不能做到的。</p>
<p>關於他的文學修養，完全得力於「自修大學」，英文一項，也曾下過一番苦功，據一位朋友吿我，他在北平任職報社時，夜工完畢後，尙須朋誦英文，後被主持的人聽到，以別人都須入睡，不能有此舉動，他纔停止。</p>
<p>對美術，他也有極深刻的愛好，曾與其弟牧野，在北平辦過華北美術專科學校，他自己能寫山水花卉，但非知友不能見到。</p>
<p>他歡喜抽抽紙烟，不喝酒，平時也高興唱幾句平劇，更高興約幾個朋友品茗閒談。母親尙健在，年已七十多了，他事之很孝，母親沒有吃過的東西，他是不吃的。</p>
<p>最近他常用「舊燕」或「打油詩人」的筆名寫了很多的詩詞，而且還出了「山窗」和「旅行」的二册小品文，同樣地淸新流麗，使人發生愛好。</p>
<h3>舟子</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>月初昇時，湖上被撒下了薄薄的銀光，於是夜的湖上是透明了。</p>
<p>幼年的舟子，輕輕的搖着槳，輕輕的，船從水面悄悄的滑過，風是多末細微，我看着　　的漣漪上晶晶的波光，恬靜的湖上一切聲音都沉睡了，只有着那有節奏的槳，輕輕的敲擊着湖水，那低低的像是夢裏的聲音。</p>
<p>這是一隻載夢的船嗎？</p>
<p>在月光底下舟子的臉是慘白的顏色，小小的年紀，該正是接受陽光與露珠的嫩草；然而爲了生活，爲了二頓吃不飽的麥屑飯，將童年賣給了這把寂寞的槳，搖着，搖着，永遠的，在月色中，在陽光裏，在風吹的時候，在雨打的時候，永遠這樣的搖。…</p>
<p>沉默的，不說一句話，也不唱一首歌，年華偸偸的從槳聲裏逝去。對這岑寂的湖上，已經是太膩了，再沒有悠閒的心情來領略這湖上的風光；且看疲倦的眼睛吧，已沉墜於那遼遠的夢幻裏。</p>
<p>該是做着那星星的夢吧！還是做那水藻的夢呢？也許連這一點閒情也沒有，因爲明天的現實是艱難的啊！明天肚子還是依然會餓的。……</p>
<p>在疲倦的眼睛裏，我也許是比較幸福的，眞的我幸福嗎？旅人的夢也一樣凄淸，像是萎謝的花朶，也受過多少風雨的吹打，雖然能倫閒一日，而路程却跑得够多的啊！</p>
<p>吿訴我，這是一隻載夢的船嗎？假使是的，幼年的舟子你搖我回家吧！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　59</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「「通縣爲河北一害，不行根治，將如毒癌，一俟發展，後患無窮。近知貴部已有人在該地活動愚認爲該縣僞軍及僞保安隊，應爲活動對象：兩種團體中，不乏血性男兒，亦在待機行動；若輩多長白山產，性雖粗野，惟頗明大義，所惜者，貴部下多南方健兒，與彼等，路綫不同，匪特難以合作，恐兩者間誤會尤多；此愚所以介紹耀羣女士　着虎城之一大原因也……蕭虎城雖僅屆童年，北地四十餘大小寨子，與不知有小老虎其人……此二人設能受命赴通，担任聯絡，必能事半功倍……」」</p>
<p>Ｗ君念到這裏，很得意似的，瞧着我點了點頭說，「老兄，您這可明白他們兩人的重要性了吧？」說着立即又縐攏盲尖，嘆了一口氣，「沒有想到他們把聯絡的大功吿成，沒有等到大事成功忽然失踪，眞有些呌人氣悶……不過，我想他們决無危險，也許……」</p>
<p>室內那位電訊收發員，這時匆匆走了過來，把剛牧到的一張情報，遞給Ｗ君。Ｗ君顧不了說話，立刻集中注意力到情報上。</p>
<p>「岳兄，瞧，這是第三次報吿」，說着徵微展開了笑容，把電稿滬給了我。</p>
<p>「平十六號，通，進行已達成功程度，冀察自治軍十二團全團，保安大隊全體一千五百名，同時舉事，晚六時二十分至十時正，日與亞雜軍，　探，特工，全體解决，現由十六號專及保安隊長張硯田，張慶餘，薛覺，第十二團長杜軍飛等，率其部下等，在郊外與日軍作戰。股逆及其黨部幹部人員等，斬除殆盡，偽公府亦已燒燬，紀蕭二位同志，迄發電時止，仍無消息。二十八，特，平，十六號等」</p>
<p>時間已到十一點十五分，我把應用的幾件東西整理齊備，又由Ｗ君給我介紹了兩位同行的同志，我便與Ｗ君握手吿別。</p>
<p>我們的車子仍由正陽門川城，通過了戒嚴哨崗，沿着鐵道公路，向通縣出伐。到了二道口，離開我方陣地數百碼，在敵方火錢下，岔到支路，向北繞着大彎進行。出了敵方射擊圈外，在一個冷僻地方，我把準備好的一張通行車證，貼在車子遮塵玻璃上，沿着小路，折向東南，朝平通公道行去，這時，愈向前進，日方的警戒，哨愈密，因爲已經進了他們的警戒封鎖綫了。爲便利計，我已經拿出了看家本領，搖身一變，成了一個道地的日方特工人物。再前，不到一小時，我們已經安抵通縣北郊，可是南郊外的砲火槍聲，仍舊猛烈的轟擊着。離城不到一里，我們穿過了日人最後一層封鎖，到了一層「無人境地」，便把車上通行證取下。在這種混亂塲上，也只有我們這一類的人，行動上才有這種自由。</p>
<p>因爲還未曾看見我方臨時哨崗，我們不敢驟馳，只好把速度减得極低。直到離開通城北門不到一里，才發現入城大路被轟斷了，車子無法再前。我們剛要下車探索，突然聽得槍聲一響，砰，嘶的一聲，子彈從我們頭上飛過，同時聰得有人吆喝「口號！」</p>

<h3>克里浦斯夫人來華</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>克里浦斯夫人已到達我們的首都了，我們歡迎這位中國之友，不僅願她旅途愉快，更希望她在中國遊覽各地時所見所聞，能獲得誠樸，親切，和平，友愛，我們中國人所具有的這些德性的接觸。</p>
<p>夫人是英國援華會會長，過去她給與我們的帮助，確實不少，但作爲我們中國人所感激她的，倒並不是在若干若干英鎊的援華基金，而是她所領導的這一運動的意義，這一運動是發揮了人類最高貴的同情心，更鞏固了人類社會的道德基礎。</p>
<p>人類的相處，倘使都能相親相愛，患難相助，疾、病相扶持，則世界今日又何致於如此之擾攘不已，詐　爭奪？更何致於盈野盈城的殺伐呢？</p>
<p>在克里浦斯先生訪華返英之前，夫人對於中國的認識和了解，可以說決不超過一個普通的英國人，但她較深刻地明瞭以後，最近這幾年來在全英各地奔走呼籲的熱情，令我們感泣。她成爲我們的友人，由於她的原故更增加了我們許多英國的友人，這一收穫，是遠在那些援華基金之上的。</p>
<p>英國人的性格一向深沉，不容易交朋友，但決不輕諾寡信，結交以後，可以終身做好朋友，這和我們中國人之好友，以及「寗人負我，決不負人」的傳統道德觀，頗能投合。所以，我們敢信克里浦斯夫人將永遠地愛我們，將永遠地做我們的好朋友。</p>
<p>國慶的首都，有這位嘉賓自海外蒞臨，確是我們的光榮。</p>

<h3>我是〔伊索風〕</h3>
<p>— 朱平譯自Life　（Sept．2，1946）第五〇頁</p>
<p>「我是伊索風。這裏是××公司，某先生不在，有什麼話可對我說。請準備——現在——請說吧」。</p>
<p>你可有給電話機看住的感覺？你怕這黑東西會在你走出辦公室閒散片刻的時候鬧起來？你想溜出去玩一會球——存心讓它不住的響——可又有些不放必？請別着急，這裏吿訴你一件新奇的東西，能替你解決那些問題。當你外出而有人打電話給你時，你的電話便會發出一種柔和的聲音替你回答：「我是伊索風。這裏是某某公司。某先生不在，有什麼話可對我說。請準備——境在——請說吧」。</p>
<p>廣吿上登着：「伊索風能爲你收發電話」。眞的，許多通信專家研究了近五十年的目的物，竟因伊索風的發明而獲得了。當你外出之前，祗要把它和電話綫連接起來就可以。回來時可拿起電話聽筒，再把伊索風上的機鈕一技，要是有人打過電話來，它便會原原本本的吿訴你。</p>
<p>原理</p>
<p>伊索風的基本原理是相當簡單的，包括一具普通電話機和一具記錄言語的鋼絲錄音機。如果你外出而有人打電話來，在鈴聲響了四次以後，伊索風就會自動的發出上述錄音：「我是伊索風……等等。」（別的辭句亦可由你自已選定。）然後等待着記錄對方的發言。倘使你給這新奇的東西　駭得啞口無言，它會等上你半小時，甚至到你說了爲止。可是說完以後，別忘掉報上你自已的姓名，然後再把電話掛斷。同時，它又可等待第二次有人打電話來了。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰時，瑞士受立　地方一家以製造航空用加農砲聞名世界的奧列根。蒲萊公司從一個名叫摩勒的德國人那裏，長得了伊索風的專利權；又委托該公司的設計部主任——一位　　的青年物理學家和火器專家——凱勒，設法改進，俾適於問　，境在瑞士國內公開使用的伊索風，已有八十具。其他各國可　於短期內有該項機器應市。</p>
<p>真妙</p>
<p>伊索風機件構造之精妙，足使瑞士之鐘錶匠自嘆不如，因爲它的妙用，還不止上面所說的一種。如果你在外面玩球時，恐怕會有人打電話給你；那你不妨利用近便的電話，打一個回去，你就可以聽到伊索風替你記錄下來的一切。</p>
<p>那還不算奇妙，最奇妙是它還能保守你的秘密。否則，不是任何人都可以撥了你的電話號碼去偸聽你的伊索風的錄音？表面上，伊索風不過是一架普通的電話機，裝在一具較大的金屬箱上，箱面上有四排（每排五枚）撳鈕和十枚符號，其中二排撳鈕上印着一至〇十個數字。當你外出以前，先把鑰匙插入箱旁的鎖孔內，向右下方旋轉四分之一周，然後在印有數字的撳鈕中閱，隨意挑幾個撳下去。譬如說，撳下三·五·七·三個數字，然後把鑰匙　　　出，　下　　　自動復原。這親，像已　成了你的密碼——三五七。</p>
<p>呼呌</p>
<p>你從外出打電話回去時，等伊索風說到「　　　」時，　須朗　呼叫：「喂！喂！」。爲樣一來，伊索風不再繼續說：「現在—請說吧」。它會說出一連串的數字，從一至〇，每字間隔二秒鐘。這時，你須牢記着你的密碼—三五七，　它說到三時，你又須像剛纔一　的呼呌：「喂！喂！」，跟着它說到五和七時，也是這樣。祇要你沒曾把密碼數字弄錯；它一定會把它錄下來的電話全部告訴你。</p>
<p>要是你把自己編就的密碼遺忘而想胡說瞎猜，它便會不客氣地發出一種不理的聲音。你想，這不是一種極好的保守秘密的方法？因爲這十個數字的編排方式，竟有一千〇二十三種之多。任何人想把這些方式逐一試遍，非八小時不可。同時你却可以隨時變換你的密碼。眞可以說是安如泰山。</p>
<p>也許你聽取伊索風報吿後，想把錄音取消。這也不是什麼難事，祗要在它把錄音放送完畢而發出嗡嗡聲時，你可跟着說：「擦去！擦去！」。錄音便會從此消逝，踪跡全無。</p>
<p>假使你自已想錄下些什麼話，可以在它把錄音送完而發出第一次嗡嗡聲時，你再呼呌：「喂！喂！」，然後說你所要說的話，它會一字不遺的替你記錄下來</p>
<p>你想到外埠去一次嗎？譬如說；你現住紐約，想到支加哥去接洽一件重要買賣。同時你的合夥人爲了業務，要到紐奧林去。你得知道，旅館客滿在現在是家常便飯，所以你們倆誰都沒有把握，能在那一家指定的旅館裏找到一間住房。</p>
<p>密碼</p>
<p>在出門以前，你們可以共同約定一個密碼。然後儘管鎖上了門，各奔前程，担保你毫無問題。你到了支加哥以後，你能住到那裏就可以住在那裏，當然不會要你住在露天的，第二天的生意經，也順利談妥。可是你怎樣通知你的合夥人？別忙，很簡單的，你可以就近打一個長途電話回紐約辨事處，讓伊索風錄下你現在何處和談判經過如何。你的合夥人也打電話回去的時候，便可利用你們共擬的密碼，聽到你的錄音。</p>
<p>倘使你因第一次聽到伊索風而驚奇不止，竟忘掉發言，它會在等待十二秒鐘後，再把開塲自重述一遍。即使你忘了你想說的話，需要到日記簿裏去找尋，這十二秒鐘的時間，也足够有餘了。</p>
<p>要製造一具混成一體的電話錄音機，到現在爲止，尙毫無辦法。目今所使用的，都是分作二部份：一部份爲一長方型的金屬匣（約如二隻打字機桌面那樣大），另一部份就是普通的電話機。金屬匣可以安放在辦公室內任何處所，匣內裝置着全部錄音儀器。</p>
<p>出租</p>
<p>在瑞士，伊索風是出租而並不出售的，租約五年一期，按月租金一五〇瑞士法郞（約合美金三五元）。美國在短期內，恐難於有伊索風問世。因爲這並不是裝了機件就可使用的，必須於事先廣事宣傳，使一般人對於這新奇的怪東西，有相當的認識，方不致於聽到伊索風的開塲白而手足無措。</p>
<p>其次是因爲美國政府對於曾於戰時以軍火售於德國之奧列根公司之關係，甚表冷淡。奧列根之主持人瀟萊是瑞士最富的軍火製造商——從前是德國公民。他動盡腦筋，設法控訴美國政府，追償一筆三千萬至五千萬元美金的廠租，那是美國軍隊借了他的軍火廠製造軍火用的。同時因爲伊索風的來路不明，恐怕蒲萊也難於確保他的專利權。據奧列根公司的宣稱是他們從德人摩勒那裏獲得的。</p>
<p>現在德國美佔領軍當局正在調查這事，如果浦萊所持的理由法律根據不足，那麼美國公民將可自由製造。不用說，那時蒲萊先生的被擯門外，是毫無問題的。</p>

<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>一個純粹的學者，參加政治。</p>
<p>以純粹的學者，投身入政治舞台的，現任外交部長王世杰先生，便是其中一個。他是勝利後和平談判中的新聞人物。</p>
<p>當五四運動時代，王氏是新文化運動的一員健將，時常在新靑年，新潮等雜誌上，發表著作見解，和胡適·傳斯年·羅家倫等齊名。</p>
<p>王氏是湖北崇陽人，字雪　，現年五十六歲。在天津北洋大學畢業後，在民國三年。赴英國留學，六年，得倫敦大學政治經濟學士後，隨即轉入法國巴黎大學，於民國十年，取得法學博士學位。歸國後，任國立北京大學憲法敎授，法律系主任。這時，華北由北京政府黨政。王氏利用敎學餘暇，創辨「現代評論」，對當時　敗政治，施以嚴厲的抨擊，該刊逐被查封，王氏也不得不南下，另謀出路。</p>
<p>民國十六年，初任國民政府法制局局長，是爲王氏轉入仕途的開始，十七年，海牙國際法庭耳聞王氏的大名，特地恥爲裁判員。十八年回國，任武漢大學校長，二十二年，任敎育部長，在任凡六年之多。二十六年，任中央宣傳部長，直至去年，轉任外交部長。</p>

<p>關於訂立條約，出席會議，有不少的國人，對王氏含有責難與不諒解，關於這一層，我不願加以主觀的批評，但是我們應該知道，中國要爭取國際上的地位，必須全體國民一致團結奮起，方才可以換得他國的尊重，單憑一位外交代表去折衝樽俎，任濕他如何能言善辯，是不克奏功的。何况外長上面還有政府。</p>
<p>王氏有一個美滿和諧的家庭，夫人是蕭德華女士，育有兩子兩女，兩位女公子—雪華，秋華，都已經畢業中央大學，而且都是技術人材，一位學醫，一位習工。</p>
<p>王世杰的樣子，有人說與上海市長吳國楨極相像，不過，王氏却比吳國楨嚴肅多了，他沒有吳國楨那樣談笑風生的丰度。新聞記者是更歡迎吳國楨的。</p>

<h3>Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway to Undergo Partial Withdrawal Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is understood that the withdrawal of Soviet employees from the China Changchun Railway (CCR) will be partial rather than total. At the beginning of the withdrawal, the Soviet side formally notified Mr. Zhang Jia'ao that the personnel being withdrawn were those who were weak and needed long-term recuperation and those who had urgent matters requiring them to return to their country. Whether or not someone would replace them later was not mentioned. As of this point, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a formal note from the Soviet side regarding this matter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] The first group of Soviet employees withdrawing from the China Changchun Railway will fly to Dalian after the Double Tenth Festival. Our side is currently preparing the planes. After the first plane arrives in Dalian, it will carry Soviet Consul Petrov stationed in Dalian to Shenyang. It is said that he is coming to see the Soviet僑民 in Shenyang. There are about 280 Soviet侨民 in Shenyang, plus more than 600 former White Russians who are now Soviet citizens or who have not been listed as Soviet citizens. The bureau believes that the Soviet withdrawal of CCR employees is in response to the requests of Soviet employees, because in their minds the treatment is too low and they feel inconvenienced. In fact, the salaries of our employees are even lower than theirs. The general public has different views on this matter.</p>
<h3>Situation in Chahar Province to Take a Sharp Turn for the Worse: Fu Zuoyi's Troops Pressing on Zhangjiakou; Communist Troops Near Baoding Gradually Moving North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The situation in Chahar Province is about to take a sharp turn for the worse. Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, told reporters that the National Army could recover Zhangjiakou within three to five days. Wang said: He had not yet received a formal report on whether Huailai had been recovered. The battle is currently still raging in the Huailai and Yanqing areas. The central position of the Communist troops in that area has been breached, and further assistance is needed. The first to recover Zhangjiakou may be Fu Zuoyi's troops, which are continuing south from Zhangbei. This unit is very close to Zhangjiakou and can quickly recover it. He also said that once the Communist troops lose Zhangjiakou, they may abandon the positions in the Huailai or Xiahuayuan area and retreat south. The strength of the Communist troops on the Pinghan Railway is not great, but their harassment is strong, but it is not enough to affect the war situation in Chahar Province, and can only play a role in containing some troops. The Communist troops' tactic of attacking weakly and defending strongly is temporary and cannot last long, and will eventually be defeated.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] News from the transportation sector: There were no major changes in the war situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway last night and this morning. Communist troops near Baoding are gradually moving north to prevent the National Army from advancing south. A connected report in the afternoon said that four regiments of Communist troops had moved to Matou Town southeast of Liulihe and were building fortifications.</p>
<h3>Smoke of Gunfire Permeates the Outskirts of Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, declared at the National Day celebration meeting of various agencies on the 10th: At a time when government orders cannot be implemented, bad elements are wantonly causing trouble, and the people are suffering immensely, we must adhere to the revolutionary spirit of the past, remove all obstacles, and relieve the pain of the people. I believe that in the near future, these bad elements will be wiped out.</p>

Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and Wang Shuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, went to a side room together to talk.

<h3>Mao Zedong Flew to Harbin</h3>
<p>Communist Party Focus Intends to Shift to Northeast</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] Mao Zedong once flew to Harbin to convene a meeting with Lin Biao and other personnel. In view of the relief of the siege of Datong, the emergency in Zhangjiakou, and the abandonment of Chengde, the Communist troops intend to shift the focus of the Communist Party to the Northeast to establish a "United Democratic Government" to confront the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] The Communist troops outside Harbin are preparing for war quite urgently, with the appearance of preparing for trench warfare.

The vanguard forces have now exceeded San Duo and arrived at the estuary (the estuary is 25 miles from Xinghua).

According to a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party, Zhang Junmai praised the National Assembly for being held as scheduled, but it must be a unified National Assembly. Also, Zeng Qi arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but is still claiming illness and refusing visitors. After arriving in Shanghai, Zeng had lengthy discussions with Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Chen Qitian and other leaders of the Youth Party in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Meets with Representatives of the Political Consultative Conference to Discuss National Affairs</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] With the situation still not progressing, figures from the Third Force suddenly became active on the 10th. Li Huang, a leader of the Youth Party, arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 9th and visited Liang Shuming on the morning of the 10th, expressing agreement with the compromise opinions put forward by Liang. The two then jointly visited US Ambassador Stuart, talking about the opinions, and heard that the ambassador expressed his hope that everyone would work hard to promote peace in China. The two then visited Shao Lizi to exchange views. At noon, they called Zhang Junmai, who was staying in Shanghai, and asked Zhang to also come to Beijing to discuss national affairs. At 6:00 PM, Liang visited Dong Biwu, and at 7:30 PM, he visited Li Huang. After leaving, he went to Xiaguan Station. Liang's visit to Shanghai aimed to urge Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing and to meet with representatives of the Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai to discuss national affairs. Li visited Mo Dehui again at 8:15 PM. According to Li, Liang's compromise opinions are very good, and his spirit of running around is also admirable. He is also extremely willing for peace to be realized as soon as possible, so if people from various parties come to Beijing immediately, he will stay in Beijing temporarily. As for Chairman Chiang's public statement, he believed that the attitude was very moderate. When a reporter asked about the Youth Party's list of delegates to the National Assembly, it was said that the list had not yet been submitted, but it would be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the number of government committee members had not yet been discussed.</p>

<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Issues Broadcast, Encouraging Officers and Soldiers to Strive to Build the Nation; Loyal and Brave Striving Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] On the evening of the Double Tenth Festival, Chief of General Staff Chen broadcasted a speech to officers and soldiers nationwide on the military radio station, stating: Today is the first National Day commemoration after our victory in the War of Resistance and the return of the National Government to the capital. The whole country is rejoicing and celebrating together. What is particularly gratifying is that the Central Executive Committee made a resolution this morning that Chairman Chiang's term is expiring, and because the National Assembly is about to convene, it was resolved that Chairman Chiang's term be extended until the day that a President is legally elected after the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, all of our officers and soldiers can still be loyal and brave in fighting to save the country and the people, to maintain the independence and freedom of the nation and the nation, and to accelerate the success of unified and peaceful construction under the wise leadership of the Chairman. Last night, the Chairman broadcasted a speech to compatriots across the country, and I believe that all of our officers and soldiers have also heard it. Now I will briefly mention three points to explain:</p>
<h3>Military Orders Must Be Unified</h3>
<p>(1) The Chairman's consistent position is peaceful unification and construction. Indeed, the goal of our National Revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unification and social stability. Therefore, the government's current policy on the situation is to safeguard national unification first, and to seek unification through peaceful means. It is necessary to implement the reorganization plan, to nationalize the military, and to establish a national army in order to achieve unified military orders. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate local separatism so that the nation's laws and regulations can be implemented throughout the country to achieve unified political orders. It is hoped that all our officers and soldiers will faithfully practice and jointly abide by this.</p>
<h3>Remove Obstacles to Construction</h3>
<p>(2) The main task of the current stage of the revolution is to earnestly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood to accelerate the completion of the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the livelihood of all officers and soldiers, our Chairman pays great attention to this and constantly seeks improvement. However, due to the instability of domestic politics, the economy has always been in disarray, and prices are soaring daily. Although salaries have been repeatedly raised, it is not a fundamental solution. All our officers and soldiers have suffered greatly from the threat to their livelihoods in the past. Even after returning to the capital, life is still very difficult, especially the livelihoods of demobilized soldiers, which the Chairman is even more concerned about. Plans have long been drafted, but implementation is hindered because production and construction have not yet begun, thus hindering job transfers. We believe that all our officers and soldiers can understand this. However, in my official capacity, I must still do my best. Soldiers have a sacred duty to defend the nation, and they do not compare temporary joys and sorrows. Think of the general public, the old and weak abandoned in ditches, the young and strong wandering everywhere, the disparity in joy and sorrow is as great as heaven and earth. Therefore, I believe that those who only know how to increase their personal wealth and do not care about the safety of the nation and the people are not only short-sighted but also building nests on curtains. Therefore, today's matters cannot be solved by piecemeal measures. It is necessary to thoroughly remove the obstacles to construction, eliminate corruption and local bullies, and reform the entire economic system in order to develop national industry and improve the national economy. This is the fundamental solution.</p>
<h3>Stabilize Social Life</h3>
<p>The glorious victory of the past eight years of resistance against Japan relied on the loyalty and sacrifice of all our officers and soldiers. The nation-building work in the future still requires all our officers and soldiers to work together with one heart and one mind to remove obstacles to peace and consolidate national unification. The purpose of resisting foreign aggression during the past eight years of war was to save the country. The purpose of removing obstacles to peace in the future to stabilize social life is to save the people. It is hoped that we will encourage each other and move forward together on the road to nation-building.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Writes to Wang Lingji, Recounting His Impressions in the United States</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanchang, 9th] He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, after flying to the United States, recently wrote to Wang Lingji, chairman of this province, recounting his impressions in the United States. He said: "After arriving in the United States for two weeks, I have not yet been able to conduct thorough research on the situation in the United States. However, from what I have observed, the United States can be described as a wealthy, strong, healthy, and happy nation. The general standard of living of the people is very comfortable. The standard of living is not only high but also very balanced. There is not much difference between urban and rural life. A reasonable life can be enjoyed by almost everyone. In terms of clothing: Whether in cities or villages, ordinary people wear clean and tidy clothes. In terms of food: Ordinary people have one dish and one soup per meal and can drink milk every day, which provides the necessary nutrition. The rich do not overindulge in this regard. In terms of housing: Because it is not a large family system, every home is very simple. The necessary bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, bathrooms, and kitchens are all equipped. Workers and farmers can also own their own houses. In terms of transportation: On average, there is one car for every three to five people. Workers can also own their own cars. In short, there are very few extreme disparities between luxury and destitution. The rich mostly devote themselves to developing production and construction and do not specialize in personal enjoyment. In addition to having their own professions, most women still have to cook, do laundry, and do all the trivial things at home because ordinary families rarely hire servants."</p>
<p>"As for public buildings, public entertainment, and welfare undertakings, they are extremely large in scale. All of these are things that our country should learn from. The reason why they can achieve this is naturally due to the development of industry, convenient transportation, and the popularity of education. However, I believe that the reason why they can achieve this is actually due to the spirit of service of officials and the spirit of law-abiding of the people. Officials of all levels devote all their energy to fulfilling their responsibilities. The premise is the country and the people, and the goal is national defense and the people's livelihood, that is, how to promote the prosperity of the country and the welfare of the people. We have seen that all government facilities are aimed at this goal, and they have achieved results. There is absolutely no such thing as officials only being officials and not doing things, or working for personal gain rather than public good."</p>
<p>"As for the spirit of law-abiding, people can automatically abide by any regulations. For example, traffic lights at intersections are automatically controlled by machinery. When a car approaches a red light, even if there are no vehicles crossing in front, it will stop and wait for the green light to turn on before proceeding. Therefore, there are no traffic police at all intersections, and traffic is orderly. Also, at the entrances and exits of roads, there are no ticket collectors. Passengers automatically pay five cents into the box provided before entering the car, and there are no fare evaders. Things like this are all enough to show the spirit of law-abiding of the people. This is the basis for everything to be orderly and on track. The reason why our country's undertakings cannot succeed or progress slowly is the lack of these two spirits. Although there has been progress in recent years, it is still far from this. I believe that our country should vigorously promote and establish these two spirits, and then all good plans and good laws can be implemented and fully utilized. Otherwise, empty talk about construction will be difficult to achieve in reality."</p>
<p>"Americans live very seriously when working and very lively after work, either exercising or engaging in other legitimate entertainment, feeling energetic. On Sundays, most drive to the suburbs to spend their happy holidays. All facilities are also sufficient to meet the people's legitimate needs in this regard, which is the government's facilities mentioned above, with the people's welfare as the goal."</p>
<p>"American citizens have great respect for soldiers, and the government pays great attention to the welfare of officers and soldiers. Whether it is a troop or a military institution, there are officers' clubs and soldiers' clubs, with various legitimate entertainment facilities to make officers and soldiers happy and have a place to entrust their minds. There are cooperatives to provide officers and soldiers with various conveniences in life. For officers and soldiers with families, there are subsidies for their lives and residences. As for demobilized officers and soldiers, there are also various preferential measures, in addition to pensions, giving them the opportunity to enter schools for free. There is also considerable assistance for their marriages or existing families. All measures are designed to ensure that officers and soldiers, whether on active duty or demobilized, can rest assured. This is actually an important measure to maintain military discipline and enhance military strength. I believe that our country should pay attention to this point at the beginning of building the army."</p>

<h3>Mrs. Cripps Pays Respects at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Mrs. Cripps went to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 10 a.m. on the 10th, accompanied by Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huang Yimei, Section Chief, and Mrs. Liu, Vice Minister. Her daughter, Miss Peggy, Secretary Mrs. Clouse, and Mrs. Miller, Secretary-General of the China Relief Association, accompanied Mrs. Cripps. Mrs. Cripps was energetic and happy. Thousands of people on the tomb path were watching this distinguished guest. When Mrs. Cripps and others slowly climbed hundreds of stone steps, they often greeted Mrs. Liu, who was petite and following behind. When they reached the memorial hall, the crowd surged, so they rested in a small room. It was originally planned to offer flowers at the mausoleum, but it was cancelled due to the overcrowding. At 11 a.m., they stepped down from the mausoleum and went to the Mayor and Mrs. Ma's banquet at noon. At 3 p.m., they visited a mass wedding at the Lizi Society. At 5 p.m., they went to the National Government Chairman Chiang and his wife's grand National Day cocktail party. In the evening, they attended a dinner hosted by Minister Zhu.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>We Hope that the Good News Can Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>In Chairman Chiang's National Day address, he said, "I propose that the Three-Person Meeting and the Five-Person Meeting should be convened at the same time... to discuss the reorganization of the National Government... to resolve issues related to the implementation of the military consolidation and integration plan. Once an agreement is reached, as long as the Communist Party can cease its military actions and no longer attack the National Army, the government will immediately issue an order to cease the conflict." He also said, "The government has never abandoned the expectation of sincere negotiation with the Communist Party under any circumstances." This indicates that the government will never close the door to peace and clearly points out that as long as there is an agreement, not only a ten-day ceasefire but also a permanent ceasefire is possible. This is a major piece of good news that we received yesterday on National Day.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the National Day celebration held by all sectors of Shanghai, representatives of the citizens called on Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, to go to Nanjing to negotiate. At the same time, Zhang Junmai and other representatives of the Political Consultative Conference visited President Sun, asking him to go to Nanjing to mediate. In the afternoon, they visited Zhou Enlai again, urging him to go to Nanjing. In addition, it was heard that Ambassador Stuart will follow Special Envoy Marshall as a mediator to Shanghai. Liang Shuming, in addition to having new suggestions, will also come to Shanghai this morning to urge Zhou Enlai to return to Nanjing for peace talks. All of these indicate that Chinese and foreign figures desire peace and do not want it to be delayed. Especially the rumored news yesterday that Zhou Enlai agreed to return to Nanjing next week to continue negotiations is good news that we are happy to hear.</p>
<p>Today, our only hope is that we must not let these successive pieces of good news ultimately fall through. This newspaper's editorial yesterday hoped that "after we spend this gloomy and anxious National Day, we would unexpectedly receive good news from out of the blue." Now, there is already a rumor of good news flying in. We hope that it can be confirmed. The opportunity cannot be lost again, and the door to peace cannot be blocked again.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Committee's ad hoc meeting resolved to "extend Chairman Chiang's term until the day the president is elected in accordance with the law after the constitution is implemented." This fully expresses the government's determination to implement constitutional government as soon as possible and return power to the people. We are happy to praise this resolution; at the same time, we pray that all parties and factions will quickly be open and honest, implement peaceful negotiations, consolidate national unity, implement democratic constitutionalism, and lay the foundation for nation-building. But whether this unanimous wish of our people can be realized in the future depends on whether the conscience of the CCP leaders can be discovered at this moment!</p>
<h3>Can Monetary Tightening Control Prices?</h3>
<p>Monetary policy should make a U-turn now!</p>
<p>There are many reasons for rising prices, but they can be simply divided into three types: (1) inflation, (2) reduced production, and (3) high costs. If you want to suppress prices, it is naturally most effective to proceed in multiple ways and fundamentally find solutions. If you only focus on one point and ignore others, not only will it be difficult to take effect, but sometimes it may even lead to the opposite result. The current changes in prices and finance are a very obvious example of this.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, inflation has resulted in unprecedented high prices. In order to tackle the problem at its root, the authorities have tried their best to balance the budget and reduce the amount of issuance, which is a very proper method. According to the authorities, the issuance of new banknotes has been stopped since July of this year. If this is true, it can be said to be a major achievement in finance and worthy of our admiration. But what about prices? According to the Shanghai cost of living index, it was 449,420.28 in July, 453,674.62 in August, and 496,739.70 in September, which seems to be fairly stable. However, the rise in general wholesale prices is very obvious. Taking various major commodities as an example, they have usually risen to 1 or 2 times their original price. In recent days, the rising trend has become more intense. Yarn, cloth, rayon, and wool yarn have all seen unprecedented new highs. We don't care what the reason is, whether it is actual sales, speculation, or smuggling, but the new high price is still the new high price. If we say that this is still due to the result of inflation, then the authorities' issuance policy does not seem to have changed in the past two months, and on the contrary, they are working hard to tighten credit and reduce currency. Haven't you heard that current interbank lending rates have returned to over 20%? Haven't all production loans been announced to have been suspended? And haven't you heard that the positions of commercial banks are also very tight? It can be seen that there are other reasons for the rise in prices. Simply reducing currency and tightening credit cannot achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>The so-called other reasons are the production and cost issues mentioned above. At first glance, these two issues seem to be separate, but in reality, they are also interrelated. Because under high interest rates, it is impossible to reduce costs, and under high interest rates, how can production be promoted? What industrial and commercial enterprises feel most painful now is the inability to obtain timely and adequate financing. The repeated appeals and petitions of various groups all aim to issue low-interest production loans as one of their main goals. They will certainly not fail to know that increasing the currency supply will affect general prices, but blindly tightening credit will result in reduced production, and the result of reduced production will also stimulate prices. Moreover, the lack of materials will ultimately result in a situation where even if you are willing to pay a high price, you will not be able to obtain a supply. And reduced working hours, business closure, and increased unemployment will inevitably follow. Very simple economic problems may very likely lead to social and political problems. Therefore, when weighing the pros and cons, which path is more beneficial should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this issue does not seem to have attracted the attention of the authorities, who only plan. The authorities' consistent policy in recent months seems to have been blindly fixated on the point of reducing currency, and the more prices rise, the more determined they become, as if inflation is the only reason for rising prices and there is no other way but to tighten. The calls from industrial and commercial circles to disband the Four Joint Offices are, of course, not worthy of the attention of those in high places, and there are still no practical ways to issue loans, simplify procedures, and relax collateral requirements. On the one hand, the cash reserve to be paid to the Central Bank is strictly collected, and loans of more than 50 million still have to go through multiple approval procedures. Overdraft accounts are tightened, and the proceeds from the bidding and allocation of various received materials and state-owned production are recovered as much as possible. New tax revenues are also being rolled out one after another. The result is that all industrial and commercial enterprises have no access to loans and cannot breathe, while general commercial banks have to pay reserves to the Central Bank and collateral to the Joint Reserve Bank. Government bonds have not yet been listed, and the various bonds they hold cannot be converted into cash. Deeds and land occupation permits for real estate are not allowed to be transferred as collateral. It is said that commercial banks can only use 40% of the deposits they receive, after deducting those reserved for immediate withdrawal. Under these circumstances, how much can be used for industrial and commercial loans? How can high interest rates be reduced by relying on this small amount of funds to pay interest and all expenses? In recent days, because credit has become tighter and tighter, even first-class banks are unwilling to easily extend loans, and some have even withdrawn loans to stabilize themselves. Because they all have an impression that if there are any oversights, it may be difficult to get help. Therefore, business policies must be extremely cautious, and they simply cannot help with the difficulties of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>So, should the industrial and commercial crisis be allowed to deepen day by day? When the stores close and the factories shut down, will there still be any benefit to price policies, currency policies, and fiscal policies? If we are willing to consider it further, then it is very clear that the current financial policy has reached a turning point! In summary, we are willing to make the following contributions for the authorities to adopt:</p>
<p>(1) Understand that sticking to tightening credit alone will not achieve the goal of suppressing prices.</p>
<p>(2) Recognize the targets and release low-interest production loans to save struggling businesses.</p>
<p>(3) National banks should immediately undertake mortgage transfers and rediscounts for commercial banks' production loans as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) All reliable collateral, such as real estate, should be accepted as much as possible in accordance with Shanghai's usual practice. Restriction.</p>
<p>(5) Unreasonable restrictions should not be placed on commercial banks' loans.</p>
<p>(6) State-owned and private enterprises should be treated equally in finance.</p>
<p>(7) Currency can be tightened, but credit should not be tightened.</p>
<p>(8) National banks should implement specialization, so that each bank is responsible for its own deposit and loan business and should not be subject to heavy control; the Central Bank should truly become a bank of banks.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Embargo Gradually Lifted, 500 Tons of Steel Rails Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] UNRRA officials defended today in the U.S. House of Representatives' Surplus Property Investigation Committee on the matter of rerouting railway steel rails destined for China to southern countries. Wilder, Director of the Industrial Division of the Agency, and Svenson, Director of the Procurement Division, told the Committee that the rerouting order was issued after UNRRA was forced to suspend the shipment of goods to China. In the future, the shipment of railway steel rails from Australia and Canada to China will more than compensate for the number rerouted last time. Wilder also said that UNRRA has canceled the embargo on steel rails to China a few days ago, and 500 tons of steel rails are currently being shipped from Australia to China. UNRRA also announced that it will gradually remove restrictions on the shipment of goods in the future, but it does not intend to issue an order to cancel the entire embargo.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Vigorously Promotes Water Conservancy and Transportation: Dredging Rivers, Constructing Seawalls, and Carrying Out Qianjiang Free Ferry Projects Simultaneously; Provincial Transportation and Water Conservancy Conference to Open Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to hold a provincial transportation and water conservancy conference on the 16th. Commissioners from all districts will attend. Chairman Shen has been meeting with Yang Jian, Director of the Transportation Department, and Sun Shoupei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, for several days, instructing them to draft plans for discussion at the conference. According to Yang Jian, Director of the Transportation Department, ten highways are planned for repair, but funding is difficult and the future is uncertain. Furthermore, according to Sun Shoupei, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, plans include dredging the Jinhua River, Cao'e River, and Puyang River in sections. Once the Executive Yuan's flour arrives and the provincial engineering management fees are released, work can begin.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The First District Water Conservancy Council of Zhejiang Province convened its first grand meeting after the victory in Hangzhou to discuss future water conservancy matters in various counties in western Zhejiang. It has now concluded. Resolutions include first repairing the Hangzhou Pond River and opening up the riverbed from Maiyu to Guanyin Bridge, requiring 60 million yuan. Negotiations for construction should be handled. The meeting also passed regulations for setting up fishing restrictions and registering fish farming in lakes, rivers, streams, and ponds in various counties in western Zhejiang, and stipulated that the annual meeting will open on March 9th each year.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] Our reporter recently visited Dr. Tang Zhenxu, a specialist at the Design Office of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, to inquire about the engineering plan and its current progress. According to Dr. Tang, the project should adopt drainage and water diversion dams, with the water flow controlled within a specific range for both rising and falling tides. The entire plan is divided into two phases, each requiring two years to implement. The estimated cost for the first phase of temporary measures is 12.715285 billion yuan, including four projects: (1) Reconstructing 5,000 meters of stone seawall; (2) Repairing 6,000 meters of partially damaged stone seawall and eroded foundations; (3) Adding 22 protective foundations where the seawall is close to the water source; (4) Repairing sluice gates and culverts along the seawall. The estimated cost for the second phase of permanent construction is 28.95585 billion yuan, including the construction of twelve drainage dams and eight water diversion dams. After the entire project is completed, the cost of annual seawall maintenance can be saved, navigation will be smooth, and 100 square kilometers (300,000 mu) of fertile land can be reclaimed. At the current selling price, this land could yield 45 billion yuan. Therefore, managing the Qiantang River not only eliminates disasters but also creates a wealth-generating enterprise.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Honglie, accompanied by Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Department of Construction, and Jin Runquan and Chen Cheng, went to Shanghai to raise funds from Zhejiang natives for the construction of Qianjiang free ferries and the Xixing Wharf. It is understood that this work is progressing smoothly due to the enthusiasm of Zhejiang natives in Shanghai for public welfare. Currently, over 800 million yuan has been raised, and a "Qianjiang Free Ferry Restoration Committee" has been established. Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Qiang, Jin Runquan, and Wang ________ and six others have been elected as the presidium, with four groups under it: design (i.e., engineering), general affairs, finance, and fundraising.

The number of standing committee members has increased from over 30 to 50.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Investigates Disaster-Stricken Pixian County: No Grass Grows in the Northeast; Severe Flooding; Relief Efforts Launched in 24 Counties in Northeastern Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that although the climate and rainfall have been harmonious in the province this year, resulting in mostly good harvests, some low-lying areas have suffered flooding. In addition to the extensive disaster areas formed by the Communist army breaching the Huai River, the Grand Canal, and the Shu River in northern Jiangsu, cultivation has been delayed due to the impact of war, or harvests have been affected by the lack of draught animals and seeds. In order to thoroughly understand the disaster situation in various places and carry out relief efforts, the Provincial Department of Land and Food was specifically ordered on the 6th to quickly formulate the implementation rules for the provincial survey and reporting of disasters. The order was issued to various counties for compliance.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] The Su-Ning Branch and the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference simultaneously telegraphed the Xuzhou Third Working Team and Song Zixin, a specialist from the Ministry of Social Affairs, to investigate the flooding in Pixian County. Wang Xianzhu, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, Feng Ziqi, Chairman of the Pixian Good Samaritan Association, and more than ten gentry, including Wang Lantian, traveled by car from Xuzhou to Bayi ________ area on the 5th to inspect. Looking out from Manshanting, the ground was still damp, and no grass grew. The water in the northeastern depressions, Gongjia Lake, Jiangjia Lake, and Pengjia Lake, was a vast expanse, with the water reflecting the sky and no end in sight. According to County Magistrate Xin Yutang, the water level in Huangdun Lake, east of Gupi, and Zhangjiadawa has not yet receded. Villagers said, "This year's flood is the worst in over twenty years. Not a single grain of autumn harvest has been collected, and we will become starving ghosts. We urgently hope that the government will provide relief quickly to save us, like fish stranded in a dried-up pond."</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 9th] Zhang Yihong, Deputy Director-General of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, led a team of health personnel on the morning of the 9th, carrying 10 million yuan in cash and essential medicines to Yangzhou to join the Yangzhou Office and proceed to Shaobo to comfort, provide medical treatment, and distribute relief.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch] Since the beginning of autumn, the disaster situation in 24 counties and cities in northeastern Anhui has become increasingly severe. The Anhui Provincial Government has already decided on the following principles for rescuing disaster victims: (1) Start with the areas where disaster victims are concentrated and the safe areas in the flood zone, gradually extending to the partial scope of various places affected by floods and bandits, and then to the entire area; (2) In the early stages, emergency relief and work relief should be equally emphasized. After that, the emergency relief portion should be gradually reduced and the work relief portion gradually increased; (3) The main target of emergency relief is women, the disabled, and disaster victims over 60 years old and under 14 years old; (4) Temporary prevention and control should be carried out in areas where epidemics are prevalent; (5) Work relief projects should be adapted to local conditions. In bandit-affected areas, the focus should be on building houses, repairing roads, setting up telephones, and constructing fortresses. In flood-affected areas, the focus should be on rebuilding houses, dredging ditches, repairing levees, and building roads. The relief period is from October 1st to the end of June next year. It is estimated that 1.2 billion yuan is needed for emergency relief, work relief, flour, clothing, and emergency farmer loans for disaster victims. Requests for allocation are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Stabilizes Prices: White Rice Limited to 43,000</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently noted that commodity prices in various places have fluctuated greatly. In addition to personally going to the Su-Xi-Kun area to convene representatives from chambers of commerce and various industries to discuss ways to suppress and stabilize prices, he has paid special attention to Zhenjiang. He specially instructed the Department of Social Affairs to be responsible for convening local industries as soon as possible to hold a discussion meeting and decide on measures. The meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM on the 8th, and the following resolutions were decided: (1) The highest price for top-quality white rice should not exceed 43,000 yuan per stone, lard should not exceed 2,200 yuan per catty, and pure soybean oil should not exceed 1,280 yuan per catty. The Chamber of Commerce should negotiate with the guilds to set reasonable prices for other daily necessities and report them to the competent authorities; (2) In the future, price increases and decreases will be adjusted separately by the competent authorities in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds; (3) As the canal line has been gradually recovered recently, the provincial government will assist merchants in purchasing food from various places in Jiangbei to facilitate the flow of supplies; (4) The crisis in local industries is pressing. It is proposed to ask the provincial government to transfer the matter to the National Bank to simplify procedures and provide loans for relief; (5) Regarding the arbitrary sealing of ships, which affects the source of rice and coal, it is requested that the provincial government consult with the Pacification Zone Command to organize a regulatory agency to eliminate the abuse of ship sealing.</p>
<h3>Special Accommodation for Conscription in Suzhou, a Region of Culture and Elegance; Refugees and Vagrants Can Be Used to Fill the Quota</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] In order to establish a new standing army system and consolidate the foundation of national defense, the Ministry of National Defense has promulgated a new Conscription Law, ordering the command headquarters of each division and regimental district to be responsible for the compilation and training, and the governments of each province, city, and county to be responsible for the conscription in layers. Currently, this work has already begun. Our county has been approved by the provincial order to conscript 980 soldiers, which must be completed before the end of October. However, Suzhou is a region of culture and elegance, with a gentle atmosphere, and the time is tight, so it may be difficult to promote. Therefore, special accommodations have been made. All able-bodied men in the county who are refugees, scattered soldiers, vagrants, or coolies, aged between 18 and 35, and whose physical condition meets the requirements, can be conscripted, without strictly limiting the conscription to able-bodied men of the county, in order to avoid disturbing the neighborhood and confusing people. It is understood that the service period for the first batch of recruits is set at two years. In addition to issuing a settlement allowance of 20,000 yuan to each recruit, their family's daily life will also be borne by the local area, so there is no need to worry about the future. The Suzhou County Government has decided to set up a new recruit conscription office immediately, to send officers to manage the food and lodging of the recruits, and to transfer them for compilation and training. A meeting of district chiefs will be convened on the 9th to discuss all measures.</p>
<h3>Siyang Rice Prices Expensive: 150,000 per Load</h3>
<p>Lack of Supplies in Newly Recovered Areas</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] There is a lack of supplies and rising prices in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu, especially in Siyang, where the price of rice per load has reached 150,000 yuan. Poor people can only fill their stomachs with a small amount of miscellaneous grains and need active relief.</p>
<h3>Senators Express Heartbreak as They Ask the Investigation Team to Listen to the Takeover Situation; Six Examples of Takeover Abuses in Suzhou Summarized</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Provisional Senate of our county believes that after the Nanjing-Suzhou group of the Takeover Investigation Team arrived in Suzhou, although they actively carried out the investigation work, due to time constraints, in addition to merely urging various takeover agencies to submit original inventories, they did not go to inspect each factory, warehouse, and other properties taken over. It was just a cursory look and a mere formality. In order to express public opinion and provide opinions so as to assist the investigation, a tea party was specifically arranged to entertain the Investigation Team at 2:00 PM on the 7th. After sending an invitation in advance, we received a reply saying that time was precious and declined to attend. After the news spread, public opinion in our county was in an uproar, believing that since the group had taken time on the 6th to visit scenic spots, they should also take time to attend the tea party of the Provisional Senate. Therefore, they unanimously urged them to listen to public opinion. The Provisional Senate sent Vice-Speaker Fan Gongren to the residence to invite them, and finally, they agreed, and this tea party was fortunately not aborted.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 7th, the senators gathered at the meeting place, Zhongshan Hall, and waited until after 3:00 PM before the Investigation Team, led by Team Leader Fan Yizui, arrived late. Xu Wentian, Chief Secretary of the Provincial Government, attended. The tea party then began enthusiastically. First, Speaker Shan Shuzhuang delivered a welcome speech, hoping that the results of the recent investigation work could be openly and frankly announced so that they could be conveyed to the public. Subsequently, Senators Yan Yisheng, Fan Junbo, Zhu Guanyi, and Zhu Jiaji successively presented reports of the heartbreaking history of the takeover, which can be roughly summarized into six points:</p>
<p>(1) The Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee took over Zhuozheng Garden, the only famous garden in Suzhou, which was the location of the pseudo-provincial government. When the provincial government returned to Zhenjiang, not only were all the furniture of the pseudo-Jiang taken away, but also the original antiques and furnishings were swept away, even the floorboards, hall frames, and flower frames were not spared.</p>
<p>(2) Zhongshan Hall, the location of the pseudo-provincial party headquarters, was built before the war by Suzhou merchants. After it was taken over by the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee, all the application equipment was transported back to Zhenjiang, even the sign was taken away.</p>
<p>(3) Zaobao News Agency was founded by Yan Yisheng before the war. During the war, he went to Chongqing. The Zaobao's machines and materials were occupied by the enemy and pseudo-regimes and used to publish the pseudo-Jiangsu Daily. After the victory, with the approval of the Central Propaganda Department, the provincial government was instructed to order the Suzhou County Government to keep them in custody. However, after Yan returned to Suzhou, the machines and materials had been transferred by the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee to the Suzhou News Agency for use, and the request for their return was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(4) The Guohuo Company was founded during the war and was purely a merchant-run enterprise to boycott Japanese goods. Because Zhang Yipeng had a small share of capital, the enemy property office used the excuse of enemy shares to delay its return. The internal damage is very serious, and if it is not repaired, it may collapse completely.</p>
<p>(5) In the second district of the county, the enemy occupied a large amount of farmland to build an airfield. At that time, many farmers were ruined. After the victory, it was taken over by the military organs, and the request for its return was repeatedly unsuccessful. Now, not only can farmers not use it for production, but they also have to pay land rent every year.</p>
<p>(6) The warehouse is often stolen, and the damage is huge, which is by no means something that thieves alone can do. A thorough investigation should be conducted, and it should not be arbitrarily concealed.</p>
<p>After the senators finished their reports, Xu Wentian, Secretary of the Provincial Government, stood up and debated each point criticizing the Provincial Party and Government Takeover Committee. For a time, the debate was fierce. Finally, Fan, the head of the Investigation Team, stood up and replied, saying, "The various heartbreaking facts of the takeover work that have been raised, our group will do our best to solve them or report them to the central government for processing. The problem of material disposal is that there are still takeover agencies directly under the central government that have delayed the transfer, so it has not yet been implemented. We have seen in the military warehouses mountains of grain piled up, which is becoming increasingly moldy. In this time of national famine, this contradictory phenomenon is heartbreaking to speak of and should be reported to the central government to complete the processing work as soon as possible. As for our group's investigation work, due to the limited number of people and the vast area, we can only get a little head start. Before leaving, we will have a detailed report." The tea party was adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Jeep Accident in Suzhou: First Fatality; A Young Girl Tragically Dies Under the Wheels of Former Mayor Qian's Car</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] At approximately 7:00 AM on the 8th, a case occurred at the intersection of Shalipi Alley, Hulong Street, inside Pingmen, where a jeep ran over and killed a female student who was only a few years old. It has been found that although jeep accidents have occurred from time to time in Suzhou after the victory, this is the first time that a fatality has occurred. It is reported that Xiao Mei, the daughter of Lu Dongliang, the owner of Lu Yuanxing Weaving Shop at 579 Hulong Street, was eight years old and attended the second grade of Huimin Primary School in nearby Shalipi Alley. At approximately 7:00 AM on the 8th, Xiao Mei, as usual, carried her schoolbag to school. As she was approaching the intersection and crossing the street, suddenly a jeep with the license plate number Guohu 211076, traveling from north to south (i.e., from Pingmen Road towards Guanqian), with the driver and two women aboard, sped past at a high speed. Xiao Mei was unable to avoid it, and the car was traveling too fast to brake in time, breaking Lu's right calf and crushing her right skull, causing brain matter to flow out. Seeing that an accident had occurred, the driver immediately took the injured person to the nearby Dagong Hospital. The hospital immediately instructed them to send her to Boxi Hospital in Tiansizhuang. After arriving at the hospital, the driver, who claimed to be surnamed Shen, asked the hospital's doctors to administer emergency treatment quickly. Dr. Zhou injected painkillers, etc. Because Lu was unconscious, she finally died at 12:30 PM. The body's relatives received the news around 10:00 AM when the girl was already dying, bleeding from her nose and mouth. She died soon after. Later, the car owner (former Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun) sent someone to the hospital to mediate with the family of the deceased. In addition to providing generous clothing, a coffin, and funeral expenses, they also compensated for the loss.</p>

<h3>Wang Maogong Visits Suzhou Again</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Jiangsu Province Chairman Wang Maogong and his entourage visited Suzhou again from Yu at approximately 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th and stayed at the Garden Hotel. Wang met with our reporter alone and made a statement, saying, "This tour of the counties took four days, covering six counties: Xi, Su, Wu, Kun, Tai, and Yu. I will go to Danyang again at 12:00 tonight and can return to the provincial capital on the afternoon of the 10th. The main task of the inspection is to suppress grain prices, and secondly to assess the progress of the bandit suppression work in various counties. The impression I got regarding grain prices, except for Su and Xi, the new rice in other counties of Kun, Tai, Yu, and Wu had already fallen to below 54,000 yuan when I arrived. I have already ordered them to refer to the market conditions of Su and Xi at any time and to suppress prices further in light of the actual situation in various places. In the future, there should be no excessive fluctuations in grain prices in Jinghu. Regarding the bandit suppression work, when I arrived in various counties in Tai, the local military and political leaders were personally leading their troops in designated locations, which shows that various units can still effectively promote the work. In addition to earnestly advising them that governance lies in practical action and overcoming the difficulties of the environment and the lack of conditions with a spirit of creation, other instructions are roughly the same as the instructions given in Suzhou."</p>

<h3>Many Massacres by the Japanese in Changshu; People Often Buried Alive on Xiaoshan Mountain; Letter from Reader Huang Deren Provides Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, our newspaper disclosed that the military court had sent people to excavate the remains of patriots who had been killed by the enemy's Constitution outside the North Gate of Changshu. That evening, a reader named "Huang Deren" sent a letter, the original text of which is as follows: "I saw in your newspaper that the remains of loyal _____ were unearthed at the foot of _____ Mountain. I once lived in the northwest of Changshu and remember that around the 31st year (the exact year cannot be remembered), I often heard farmers talk about the small hill on Changfu Zhong (about one li from Da_____), where enemies often murdered and buried people alive in the evening, three or two at a time. However, I never witnessed it, and I didn't dare to go and see it afterward. Once, I accidentally passed by the place, and someone pointed me and said, 'This is the mud pit used by our 87th Division for target practice. A few days ago, it was the place where our patriots were killed by the enemy. There are at least five or six other places in the vicinity with about a dozen people.' If you want to understand this place and the facts, you can ask people in nearby small villages who understand national affairs to help you, and you will definitely be able to obtain accurate new evidence. Once, I remember that around the 29th year, in Xiaoshi Bridge Town, three li north of Dayi Bridge Town, an innocent person from the local area was taken by the enemy, put in a sack, and subjected to inhuman acts such as stabbing with bayonets, boiling water, and cold water, until the bones were not returned. I also heard that _____ Yuanne or Tangqiao, I can't remember which place, was captured by the enemy for two or thirty people and shot with machine guns. Only one person pretended to be dead and survived. For the above three points, please go to the local teahouses to interview the locals, and you will definitely find new discoveries." The letter was sent from this _____, but the address was not specified. It should be forwarded to the military court for reference.</p>

<h3>Implementing Uniform Standards for Teachers' Pay</h3>
<p>Dear Editor!</p>
<p>I am a primary school teacher in a rural village in Nanhui, Pudong. Due to the meager salary I currently receive, I cannot help but feel depressed. Several times I wanted to leave the education field and seek another path, but I was finally interrupted by the thought that "the salary may be improved soon." But looking at the current situation, the hope of improving the salary has completely become a bubble, and I have decided to abandon the teaching profession and seek another development.</p>
<p>The salary of our rural teachers is very shameful to say. A month's hard work is only 69,400 yuan, and food expenses must be deducted. Sometimes, if you take leave, you have to pay substitute fees. If you get sick, it's even worse! Alas! This meager salary, in this time of high cost of living, is difficult to maintain even for one person, let alone support a family!</p>
<p>Although the government has repeatedly adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers, we small teachers in the countryside do not get any benefits. From June, the government adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers in Jiangsu Province to a living allowance of 55,000 yuan, and a base salary of 240 times, calculated at a base salary of 60 yuan, totaling 69,400 yuan. But what we got in June and July was only 28,400 yuan per month. From August, it was adjusted again, stipulating a living allowance of 75,000 yuan and a base salary of 440 times, calculated at a base salary of 60 yuan, totaling 101,400 yuan. But what we got in August and September was only 69,400 yuan. I really don't understand why the local government does not implement the standards set by the government for the salaries of civil servants and teachers. If it is said that the provincial order has not yet been received and there is no basis for the standards, why has the provincial government not issued an order yet? If it is said that the land tax has not yet been collected and the local funds are not available, why not ask the provincial government to allocate them? If it is said that the provincial funds are also unavailable, why not ask the government to allocate them? I think that since the government has adjusted the salaries of civil servants and teachers, there must be a meticulous budget for expenditure, so as not to make civil servants and teachers happy for nothing! If it is said that the government has no way to do it, why doesn't the local government take the responsibility of raising funds to maintain it? Is it going to sit back and watch education go bankrupt and teachers run away?</p>
<p>Finally, I appeal to the education authorities to understand the difficulties of the small teachers, issue the salary according to the new standards, and reissue the salary for June and July, so that the small teachers can work with peace of mind and benefit the innocent and lively children. (Yifan)</p>
<h3>Picture Book Stalls Should Improve and Be Regulated</h3>
<p>The newspaper industry has the effect of promoting culture and assisting propaganda, which is of great benefit to the country and society. Therefore, before the crackdown on vendors in the city, the city government had indicated that it would allow newspaper vendors to set up stalls on the roadside. When the crackdown was implemented, the city government's documents reiterated that newspapers were exempt. That is to say, newspaper stalls can be freely sold anywhere, as long as they do not sell prohibited publications and do not harm traffic management. Recently, I heard that many police officers are cracking down on our industry when performing their duties, regardless of whether they obstruct traffic or not. I hope that the wise officials will constantly admonish and improve the crackdown, and implement it separately to facilitate newspaper sales and maintain the livelihoods of vendors.

<h3>Constructing a New Wuxi: Demolishing the City Wall to Build Roads and Expand the Urban Area</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Office] The County Construction Committee of this county held its first meeting on the 6th to discuss the issue of demolishing the city wall to build roads. The following resolutions were made: (1) Demolish the section of the city wall from Jixiang Bridge to the West Gate first. Jiang Yinglin and others were appointed as members of the committee to study the funding for demolishing the city wall; (2) Widen the main roads in the urban area, from the East Gate to the West Gate, and from the South Gate to the North Gate, to a width of 12 meters. This will be forcibly implemented after approval from the provincial government. County Magistrate of this county, Xu Yuanruo, in order to prosper the commercial market of this county and expand the scope of the industrial and commercial area, plans to open up a new urban area near the suburbs. The aim is to build an ideal, modern city. It is said that the location of the new urban area will be selected from the area along the Xiyi Highway from the West Gate to Huishan, to the North Gate, and then to the West Gate, along the outside of the city wall. First, main roads with a width of more than 30 meters and other auxiliary transportation routes will be built. Then, plots will be opened up for merchants to build houses. The above plan has been handed over to the design team of the committee for detailed study and will be submitted to the next general meeting for discussion. In the future, after the completion of the new urban area, the county government also plans to move to that area, using the stone from the demolished city wall to build the new county government.</p>

<h3>USA, Britain and Turkey Form a Strong Front to Resist Soviet Control of the Straits - US and UK Decide to Give Economic Aid to Turkey</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Diplomatic authorities here revealed today: the United States, Britain, and Turkey are now forming a strong front to resist the Soviet Union's renewed demands on the Dardanelles Straits. However, the three countries are still willing to discuss the Soviet Union's rights in the Straits in detail. At the same time, the U.S. State Department announced that it has lent Greece $25 million in credit to purchase surplus U.S. Army overseas supplies. This is in line with the informal conclusion reached by the British and American governments three weeks ago during the Greek civil war crisis: the United States should support the current Greek government with huge economic assistance. It is said that the British and American governments have similar decisions regarding Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Diplomatic circles say that the U.S. government has sent another note to the Soviet Union, stating that the United States opposes the Soviet-Turkish joint defense of the Dardanelles. It is further learned that the Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union will resolutely reject the joint defense proposal but will not refuse direct negotiations on the future status of the Straits.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 10th] The British Ambassador to Turkey and the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Turkey held a half-hour talk with the Secretary-General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday on the issue of the Dardanelles Straits.</p>
<p>[French Press Agency, Washington, 9th] Regarding the statement that the United States will file a complaint with the United Nations organization regarding the Soviet Union's request to manage the Dardanelles Straits, informed sources have commented. It is briefly stated that the U.S. government has considered the possibility of this move. If it were true, after careful study, it was found that there are various difficulties that are not easy to overcome, and at least it will not be proposed for the time being. At the same time, the U.S. government will, within the next 48 hours, publish the two notes sent by the United States to the signatory countries of the Montreux Convention on the Straits issue and reiterate the U.S. position on the Straits.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Discusses Treaty with Romania - Britain Demands Equal Treatment with Major Powers - US Advocates Freedom of Navigation on the Danube</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 10th Radio: The Peace Conference General Assembly convened at 3:40 pm today. Chairman Molotov continued to discuss the treaty with Romania. Bevin took the stage first and stated that if the United Kingdom cannot obtain equal treatment with other major powers, it will be difficult for Britain to accept the treaty with Romania. Regarding the Romanian oil issue, for example, Bevin stated that the officially set oil price is lower than its cost, and the Allied powers' oil interests organization in Romania cannot continue to pay for itself with its own money. Regarding the issue of free navigation on the Danube River, Bevin expressed support for the French proposal to convene a meeting within a six-month period to resolve this issue. To avoid delaying time, the representative of Belgium gave up speaking. Then, Molotov took the stage amidst applause to speak.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Peace Conference Plenary Session continued at 9:00 am today to review the treaty with Romania, chaired by Molotov. The U.S. representative, Senator Vandenberg, spoke and firmly demanded freedom of navigation on the Danube River and free trade throughout the Balkan Peninsula, saying, "To seek economic health and peace in Central Europe, the Danube River must be free to navigate. If the river is not open, it will become a tragic and reactionary mistake." According to the discussion time stipulated by the four countries, the Peace Conference must finally pass the draft treaty with Romania today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 10th Radio: Vyshinsky vehemently attacked the U.S. proposal for free navigation on the Danube River and asked in return: Is the United States willing to internationalize the St. Lawrence River? Vyshinsky pointed out that there is a trade preference system within the British Empire, and the United States has special trade privileges in Cuba and the Philippines, etc. Therefore, the Soviet Union should also have trade preferences in the Balkans.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] Former President De Gaulle today re-issued a statement criticizing the new charter of the French Fourth Republic, saying that it will first lead to a weak and powerless government, then fall into anarchy, and finally become a dictatorship. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the French people will reject this new constitution in the public referendum held on the 13th of this month.

<h3>British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East Arrives in Greece to Inspect Troops - Greece Plans to Train National Guard to Suppress Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 9th] After Lieutenant General Dempsey, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, arrived here, he will meet with British generals. Some observers believe that Dempsey's arrival in Greece will cause a major political reaction. Dempsey will go to Thessaloniki to inspect the British troops in the Macedonian region and inspect the British military mission's training of Greek troops. The public originally planned to demonstrate in Athens today to protest the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference, but it was temporarily banned by order of the Minister of Public Security.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 9th] According to reliable sources: troops belonging to the "Macedonian Liberation Front" and other guerrillas are currently active throughout Greece. Prime Minister Tsaldaris has proposed a plan to train the National Guard to fight them. The British government will also express its support for this and is willing to provide light weapons. According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, the only purpose of the Greek government's request for Britain to provide weapons is to enhance its national security. Whether Britain agrees to this will have to wait until the Ministry of War, the Ministry of Industrial Production, and the Foreign Office discuss it together before a decision can be made. Greece decided to mobilize several levels of reserve troops without consulting with the British government in advance, but this decision is only related to the Greek government, and it is only right for the government to not consult with others.</p>

<h3>US Orders Military and Civilian Aircraft Prohibited from Flying into Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania - Pan American Central European Route Temporarily Ends in Brussels</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 10th] The U.S. Army Air Forces Headquarters in Europe announced today: U.S. senior authorities have prohibited U.S. military and civilian aircraft from flying into Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania.</p>

<h3>Fifth Column Active in the United States - U.S. Chamber of Commerce Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Chamber of Commerce today released a 40-page report accusing the Third International of remaining active around the world, even though it claims to have been dissolved. The report accuses the American Communist Party of being a fifth column that, with the support of sympathizers, controls the American Labor Party in New York State. The report states, "They are powerful enough to control New York State, and the voting in that state is of great importance in the presidential election. Although the number of communists is not large, their strength is not weak. Therefore, for self-defense, we should at least make the list of Communist Party members and the source of funding subject to public inspection. At the same time, the Department of Justice should collect information that exposes the truth about the party." The report said, "If communism gains power in China, hundreds of millions of people will be used to 'obey the Soviet plan' and engage in labor and military service. The United Kingdom and the United States, at the Yalta Conference, granted the Soviet Union vast rights in Northeast China and elsewhere, which is enough to threaten the National Government's continued rule over these wealthy areas."</p>
<h3>Meteor Shower Spectacular - American Astronomer Witnesses and Talks About It</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Last night, in the American sky, meteors flew wildly behind the Giacobini-Zinner comet, like natural fireworks. Scientists mostly say that such a spectacle has never been seen before. Army and government scientists in some cloudy areas said that they had used radar to contact the meteors. Astronomers and physicists boarded airplanes to the top of the clouds to admire the spectacle. Dr. Nasu of the Case School of Applied Science said: The meteors flew most densely at 3:45 am standard time, with hundreds of meteors per minute. Dr. Shinsinger, President of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, said: During the meteor shower, about 149 meteors were counted in ten minutes. Because the Earth advanced to within 131,000 miles of where the comet passed eight days ago, the comet shed meteors, forming the tail of the comet, causing this spectacle.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the World Women's Democratic Federation Meets in the Soviet Union</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: The U.S. Department of the Army announced today that the number of Americans volunteering for military service in the past year has broken all previous records, with a total of 992,648 people.

<h3>US Uses Symbolic Military Force to Support Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Round-the-World Flight Plan is of Great Significance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] There is a growing indication that the United States is determined to use symbolic military force to support its diplomatic policy. A week ago, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal announced the true mission of the aircraft carrier Roosevelt's voyage to the Mediterranean. Yesterday, Under Secretary of the Army for Air Symington announced that he plans to use a large squadron of Superfortresses to fly around the world as another "tool" to support diplomatic policy. He does not want to examine whether the machine will cause harmony or increase fear internationally. Symington said: He hopes that the State Department can approve the flight plan. Soon after Symington announced the above plan, a spokesman for the State Department nodded and declared: The department "does not object." Symington told reporters: The fleet will have 8 to 24 Superfortresses. The main purpose of the flight is to show the power of bombers, enough to complete missions anywhere in the world. He also said: Superfortresses may become a tool for the United Nations to use.</p>
<h3>Italy in Turmoil and Unrest - Unemployed Crowd's Bloody Riot - Rioters Break into Prime Minister's Office and Destroy Furniture - Government Gazette Claims Suspected Political Background</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 9th] Thousands of workers held a demonstration in front of the government offices today to protest layoffs, gathering a crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 people and clashing with the police. The police received reinforcements from the army and dispersed the crowd after three and a half hours of turmoil. Official gazettes said that one person died, 50 protesters and 29 police officers were injured. Dozens of rioters broke into the Viminal Palace all the way to Prime Minister Gasperi's office, destroying furniture along the way. The gazette accused the rioters of deliberately turning the demonstration into a riot. The police used clubs, weapons, and two police cars to disperse the crowd in front of the palace. The palace was immediately under strict guard by the military police.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 9th] The bloody riot in front of the government building today is the climax of the turmoil in recent months. This kind of harassment is caused by unemployment. The impoverished farmers who forcibly occupied the land are deeply dissatisfied with the slow progress of the land reform guaranteed by the government. The unemployed have forcibly occupied city halls and tax authorities throughout the country. Returning soldiers are trying to deprive women of their jobs. Italy is a conquered country that needs raw materials to produce and cannot temporarily immigrate in large numbers. Some observers believe that the severity of the current situation is equal to the 1930s, when labor turmoil led to a march on Rome.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 9th] After the bloody riot in front of the government, Prime Minister Gasperi ordered the press to make a statement, briefly stating: Political forces are using unemployment to cause trouble. Any government must confront this situation. Do the demonstrators think that occupying the government will solve the problem? Republican newspapers said that this bloody incident was instigated by imperialists and Mussolini's followers. Opposition newspapers published news with large headlines saying that workers are marching throughout the city to investigate who ordered the shooting.</p>
<h3>Plan to Attack Siberia - Japanese Emperor Had Approved and Endorsed It</h3>
<p>Tojo's Lawyer Kiyose's Notorious Past Revealed</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] Soviet prosecutors presented documents to the Far East War Crimes Tribunal proving that the Japanese Emperor had approved and agreed to the secret plan to attack Siberia in 1935. American defense lawyers said that this document was not applicable because the Japanese Emperor was not one of the defendants. However, Presiding Judge Webb still ruled to adopt the testimony as evidence.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Kiyose Ichiro, the shrewd and cunning defender of Japanese Class A war criminal Tojo, had accused the organizational law of the Far East International Military Tribunal and created many obstacles, just to delay the trial of Japanese war criminals. Yesterday, the Soviet prosecutor presented evidence proving that Kiyose had been a member of the National Policy Association, which was subsidized by financial groups and the government to draft plans for aggression. One of the plans was to maintain the pure bloodline of the Japanese race, which was the same as the Germans maintaining the Aryan bloodline. The plan proposed to relocate all Russians in Siberia, replace them with armed Japanese farmers, and use the remaining Russians as slaves to serve the Japanese, completing Japan's so-called "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>

<h3>Victory After Years of War, Nation-Building Begins: Celebrating National Day, the Whole World Rejoices; This City's Various Circles Held a Grand Celebration Yesterday, Jointly Seeking to Realize Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 35th National Day of the Republic of China and the second Double Tenth Festival after the victory. The whole city celebrated enthusiastically with flags flying. Various circles in this city held a celebration rally at the Daguanpeng Grand Theater on Nanjing West Road at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Wu Guozhen, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Feng Youzhen, and others served as the presidium. More than 2,000 people attended, including Kong Xiangxi, Cheng Cangbo, Xie Renjian, Yu Shuping, and representatives from all walks of life. The venue was neatly and solemnly decorated. In the center hung a portrait of the Father of the Nation and the flags of the Kuomintang Party. A brightly lit "Double Tenth" made of electric lights was also erected. On the left and right sides of the venue were written sixteen large characters: "Consolidate Unification, Guarantee Peace, Implement Constitutional Government, and Strive for National Construction." The rally began amidst melodious music. After Chairman Wu Guozhen led the salute, he gave a report on the spot, stating:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Today is the second National Day after the victory. In addition to recalling the glorious historical achievements of the Xinhai Revolution, we should especially admire President Chiang's wise leadership in fighting bloody battles for eight years and achieving genuine victory. Today, as we gather here, we are filled with emotions. Although the aggressors have long been defeated, our country's nation-building and unification work has not yet reached the ideal stage. If we humbly examine ourselves, we will surely discover the weaknesses of our nation. Just like in doing things and being a person, there are certain shortcomings. First, there is a lack of a sense of responsibility. Our virtuous friends and leaders are constantly paying attention to responsibility, and our work should be based on the nation and society as a prerequisite. We should take responsibility for everything and work hard to do it. Second, there is a lack of a spirit of abiding by the law. Now everyone is shouting about democracy, but some people really don't know what democracy means. In Western countries, the laws of the country are followed by everyone from top to bottom. However, the people of our country seem to be unable to abide by the laws of the country. For example, the traffic control in this city has been repeatedly sabotaged by those who do not comply. Third, there is a lack of compassion. Regarding this point, I personally witnessed a rickshaw being burned, and the rickshaw puller cried bitterly, but the onlookers laughed. This proves our lack of compassion. Shanghai is a big city, and international perception is crucial. We must eliminate selfishness and build the nation together to achieve the President's vision of building a new China.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi's Speech</p>
<p>Following this, speeches began. First, Kong Xiangxi gave a speech. Kong first explained the meaning of the cross, citing Western texts, saying that the cross actually contains meanings such as religion, sacrifice, and charity. Then, he mentioned that although our country has achieved victory, it is still too far from the ideal stage of nation-building. We must strive hard. "People must insult themselves before others insult them." "Self-aggrandizement" is "stinky," "stopping the lance is 'martial.'" We should sacrifice our small selves to complete our great selves. Today's Double Tenth Festival seems like walking to a crossroads, and it also seems like carrying a cross. We especially need to identify our goals and jointly seek peaceful unification, then China's future will naturally be extremely bright and splendid.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Fang Zhi spoke after Kong Xiangxi, briefly stating: It is particularly exciting to celebrate National Day here today. Last year, I attended the first celebration rally after the victory in the wartime capital. Today, I have come to Shanghai, the economic and cultural center of the country, and I am very happy to see the national flag flying. The five million citizens of the city and the 450 million compatriots across the country must share this feeling. The Republic of China has been established for 35 years, that is, it has grown to 35 years old. Whenever people have a birthday, they often recall the past and look forward to the future. The country must also do the same. Therefore, on this National Day, everyone must have memories of the past and reflections on the future regarding national affairs. The Republic of China was built with difficulty, shedding revolutionary blood and bearing the fruits of democracy. The Xinhai Revolution was celebrated and established, but after the Xinhai Revolution, there were those who destroyed the revolution, those who stole national power, and those who invaded and oppressed from abroad. After many years of struggle, the great disaster has passed. Today, we can celebrate National Day together and complete the great task of independence and rejuvenation. This is the power of the Three Principles of the People taught by the Father of the Nation, the power of President Chiang's wise leadership, and the power of the unity of the people of the whole country, loving the country and loving the nation. Today, we should not only recall the past, but also encourage the future. This is to consolidate unification, guarantee peace, and accelerate the promotion of the spirit of democracy. However, one year after the victory, domestic transportation has not recovered, the social economy is turbulent, and people's lives are unstable. We deeply know that only by strengthening unification and guaranteeing peace can we meet the people's will. Furthermore, we must implement constitutional government and strive for national construction. Therefore, we unanimously hope that the National Assembly will be convened as scheduled so that the century-old plan of nation-building can be laid and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People can be established. This is the basic task of nation-building, and it is what Shanghai and the compatriots across the country should work together to achieve. To have peace and to build the nation, we must develop the spirit of democracy to obtain it. The ancients said: "What the people like, like it; what the people hate, hate it." Today, we should not only do this, but also do what is liked and remove what is hated. If what is liked cannot be done and what is hated cannot be removed, this is actually anti-democratic. Today, the people of the whole country demand peace, demand unification, and demand democracy, but some people go against the trend, want to advocate chaos, want to split, do not want peace, do not want construction, and do not want to implement genuine democracy. This is against democracy, resisting the times, and going against the current. I hope that the five million compatriots in our city, with one heart and one mind, under the leadership of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Deputy Speaker Xu, will work together to develop the spirit of genuine democracy to build a new Shanghai and a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Following this, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech. Pan put forward supplementary opinions on the construction of the new China. He also said that President Chiang broadcast to the whole country the night before, announcing that all conscientious Chinese people and compatriots who have not forgotten the nation should repent of everyone's past and participate in the work of peaceful unification and nation-building. Today, we celebrate with laughter, but the country is like this, and we feel sad. I hope that the CCP representative Zhou Enlai will go to Nanjing to participate in consultations and reopen the door to peace, otherwise, it will be against the wishes of all the citizens of Shanghai. After the speech, Mayor Wu read out the telegram of the assembly to the President and the telegram of condolences to the families of the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance. Both were unanimously passed. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the President</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the President: "President, Victory has been achieved after years of war, and nation-building has begun. As we joyfully celebrate National Day, the whole world rejoices. Your Excellency leads the masses, rebuilding the country and creating a great cause of revival and laying a century-long plan. We admire your diligence and share our love. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We beg your examination. The Shanghai City All Circles Celebrating the 35th National Day Commemoration Assembly respectfully kowtows." (2) Telegram to the Families of the War Dead: "To the families of the war dead across the country, Victory has been achieved after years of war. As we joyfully celebrate National Day, we are at the beginning of revival, celebrating the restoration of China. We remember that this magnificent country is the result of the blood of all the soldiers. Although the heroic souls have passed away, their heroic spirit will last forever. We commemorate their bravery and are greatly inspired. Your families have made painful sacrifices for the country and great contributions to the nation. The people of the whole country deeply admire you. We send this telegram to express our respect. We hope you understand. The Shanghai City All Circles Celebrating the 35th National Day Commemoration Assembly kowtows."</p>
<h3>The Chinese Seamen's Party Department Jointly Holds a Commemorative Meeting</h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on Double Tenth Day, the Chinese Seamen's Party Department and the Chinese Seamen's Union jointly held an expanded celebration and commemoration meeting of National Day.

<h3>Chennault's Air Transport Team Reassigned to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA)</h3>
<p>Chennault's air transport team, which assisted the ERRRA in transporting relief supplies, has been changed to the ERRRA Air Transport Team in accordance with the wishes of the relevant authorities. The air transport team has been organized for some time, but due to various difficulties, it has not yet officially started work. General Chennault told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday: He went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss air transport matters with the relevant authorities. He met with President Sun Fo of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Zhou Zhirou, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, and others. The results of the discussions were quite satisfactory. Chen also said that he came to China this time to organize an air transport team to serve the Chinese people and assist in accelerating the relief work of the ERRRA. Therefore, the organization is part of the ERRRA. Some people do not understand the truth and think that the air transport team is also a commercial operation. In fact, the primary task of the air transport team is to transport the relief supplies of the ERRRA.</p>

<h3>Double Tenth Anecdotes: Lion Dance in Front of the Rising Sun Building, Shy Bride Near the Racecourse</h3>
<p>Yesterday was National Day, and national flags flew over stores and agencies throughout the city, decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, creating a New Year atmosphere. The streets were crowded with people, and passengers on trams and buses were more crowded than sardines. Rickshaws and pedicabs took the opportunity to raise prices, and a short trip often cost more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In front of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, Cantonese compatriots performed a lively lion dance, with firecrackers and gongs and drums, attracting a crowd of citizens and blocking traffic for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>A cigarette company used a truck to carry young girls wearing high hats, dressed like the "Miss America" in the newspaper, as a mobile advertisement. A trumpet player played music on the truck, touring the downtown area.</p>

<p>Many people proposed, got engaged, or got married. It was common to see flower cars decorated with colored ribbons passing by on the street. The reporter saw newly married couples entering a photo studio at the same time within a quarter of an hour in front of a photo shop. At the Datong Photo Studio near the racecourse on Nanjing Road, a newly married couple who had finished taking pictures walked out of the door. Because the car was parked on the opposite side, they could not cross the road due to traffic regulations, so they stood still for a long time. More and more passersby gathered to watch. The bride was extremely embarrassed and angry, and she stormed back into the studio. For a while, the groom was at a loss. Later, he managed to move the car a little closer, went back inside to invite the bride out, and crossed half the road to get into the car and leave.</p>
<p>Restaurants and hotels were crowded with guests, and theaters were sold out. Old managers couldn't stop smiling.</p>

<h3>China Electric Company Actively Preparing for Power Generation</h3>
<p>The power generation equipment of the China Electric Company was completely dismantled by the enemy. All the electricity supplied to Nanshi is temporarily purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company at a high price. Recently, because the road money has reached the highest load, it is often restricted. It is learned that the company is actively planning to build a 30,000-kilowatt power plant at the original new plant site in Pudong. It has already ordered 15,000-kilowatt generator parts from well-known British and American factories. In order to solve the current power shortage, it is also planning other emergency measures, which can be gradually realized in two or three months.</p>

<h3>Yu Ying Stack Robbery Case Solved, A Large Number of Accomplices Arrested and Part of the Original Loot Recovered, the Gang Leader Actually Built a Western-Style House in Pudong</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yu Ying Stack on Jichang Street, Nanshi, was robbed of seven bolts of wool and 159 boxes of Morris Gilhi cigarettes by a large number of bandits on the night of September 26th, which lasted for two hours. After the case occurred, Yao Qihong, the chief of the Penglai Police Station, and Lu Gengsheng, the deputy chief of the station, personally led officers Yang Mianzhi and police chief Zhang Shusheng to investigate the scene. They believed that the methods of robbery by the bandits were extremely clumsy, and it seemed that the coolies and boatmen were in collusion. They left investigators to investigate and inquire. At the same time, Director Xuan attached great importance to the case and ordered it to be solved within ten days on October 2nd. At midnight on the 7th, they received a secret report that Tao Jinyuan, the owner of the Juhua Barber Shop at Guanqiao Pier, was hiding the stolen goods from the case. Then, police chief Zhang Shusheng, who was handling the case, reported to his superiors and set off to search at night. As a result, two bolts of the original stolen wool were found in Tao's shop, and the shop owner was arrested and taken to the bureau. After Yao, the chief of the station, personally interrogated him, he learned that after the robbery, the gang had landed at the Guanqiao Dali Steamship Company Pier. At that time, Gu Youliang, the premeditated gang leader (nicknamed Xiao Yushi, who built a Western-style house in Pudong, with many henchmen), personally directed the operation with three people nicknamed Da Shizi and Da Li Shunzi. They loaded the goods into two trucks and transported them to a certain cigarette paper shop on Beijing West Road, unloading part of the stolen goods. Then, they drove to No. 152 Changde Lane on Puan Road. Because the house was small, they were transferred to a certain tofu shop on Shanhaiguan Road for temporary storage. About three hours later, the stolen goods were sold to Chen Wanxing Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 7 Shandong Middle Road. Subsequently, the chief of the station sent the original officers to secretly cross the river to Pudong yesterday morning and first arrested Gu Youliang, the gang leader (50 years old, see Gang). Then, they arrested the owner of the cigarette paper shop who sold the stolen goods and the suspected porters Xu Shihai, Zhou Mulong, Hang Pengde, Jin Sanxiao, Jin Yuanfu, Zhou Asan, and accomplices Da Shizi, Da Li Shunzi, and others, totaling more than 20 main and accessory offenders and suspects. Dozens of small cigarettes of the original stolen goods were recovered, as well as three bolts of wool that had been cut into pieces. They are currently applying for detention and awaiting investigation to continue the arrest of the remaining gang members.</p>

<h3>Fang Zhi Expresses Views on the Current Situation: The National Assembly as a Stepping Stone to Constitutionalism; Hopes All Parties Prioritize the Nation, Focus on Constitution-Making Discussions, and Avoid Emotional Impulses</h3>
<p>A reporter recently visited Mr. Fang Zhi, the newly appointed chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to inquire about the current situation. Mr. Fang provided the following information:</p>
<p>1. What are your opinions on the preparatory matters for the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: Before the convening of the National Assembly, I hope that all parties will prioritize the interests of the nation and expedite the implementation of democratic politics to lay the foundation for the long-term stability of the country. They should not allow other minor issues to prevent the establishment of the fundamental law of the country. As for the preparatory matters, the key lies in the reconciliation of opinions from all sides, focusing on the discussion of constitution-making, absolutely standing on the position of national interests, and not indulging in any emotional impulses. Even if there are disputes over the content of the draft constitution, the final decision must be made by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>2. What are your opinions on constitutionalism and the constitution?</p>
<p>Answer: National unity and political democracy are indeed the consistent demands of the people of the country today. Therefore, promoting constitutionalism is an urgent matter today, and convening the National Assembly is a stepping stone for the country to enter democratic constitutionalism. The creation of constitutionalism must first establish the fundamental law of the country to protect the freedom of the people. All political parties can carry out political activities under the constitution. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country and must conform to international trends and meet the needs of the people. The highest spirit of the constitution lies in the realization of the principle of checks and balances, that is, the theory of separation of powers and functions, so that the people have power and the government has ability. All major national policies are based on public opinion. Today's points of contention over the constitution are not in the fundamental principles of the constitution, but in the way of exercising the three powers and five powers, and the differences between the presidential system and the cabinet system. However, weighing the needs of the country and historical experience, and considering the advantages and disadvantages of the administration of various countries, the five-power constitution is the most suitable political system for China. Comparing the effectiveness of exercising the principle of separation of powers and functions with the actual results of American administration, the presidential system is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>3. What are your opinions on the overall situation?</p>
<p>Answer: Today, the international community needs peace, and the country needs unity. This is self-evident, and no one can deny it. If peace can be achieved internationally, the tragic Third World War will not occur; if unity can be achieved domestically, the implementation of democratic constitutionalism will be hopeful. The fifty years of revolutionary struggle of our party have laid a solid foundation for the independence and unification of the country. No citizen wants to see chaos again to shake the independence of the nation and the unification of the country. If the Communists continue to adopt revolutionary means and attempt to seize power by force, they will not only violate the will of the people of the country, but also affect international peace, which is definitely not the expectation of the Chinese people or even the people of the world. After the war, the wounds have not yet healed. The country cannot withstand the ravages of war, and the people cannot bear the sacrifices. Moreover, in fact, it cannot wait for a Communist revolution. Chairman has repeatedly declared that domestic disputes should be resolved by political means. As long as the Communists can faithfully implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, participate in the government and implement reorganization, and discuss politics with the demeanor of party members in the National Assembly and at all levels of people's congresses, giving up the bloodshed on the battlefield, the long-term stability of the country and the democratic freedom of politics can be easily achieved. This is truly a great fortune for the country and a great fortune for world peace.</p>

<h3>Dispute Arises Between Cadets and Sailors Over Seats on Tram</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 2:20 p.m. yesterday at the Xiejiao 18th Road tram stop in Nanshi, Jiang Tinghua, the captain of a naval academy battalion, led dozens of cadets onto a tram. At the same time, Peng Yuanjia and Zheng Cibin, five sailors in white uniforms from the Taiping warship, came to take the tram. Due to a dispute over seats, an argument broke out with the cadets. Captain Mei forbade the cadets from arguing, saying that they were all comrades. However, Peng Yuanjia and others refused to obey and retorted. As a result, they beat Jiang severely. Dozens of naval cadets also participated in the attack. On the sailors' side, due to the disparity in numbers, Peng Yuanzhu and Zheng Wenbin escaped to the nearby Shuncheng Road police station for protection. The cadets pressed closely. The police officer at the police station, seeing the seriousness of the situation, persuaded the cadets on the one hand and urgently telegraphed the Taishan Police Bureau on the other hand. After receiving the report, Sub-bureau Chief Song Tingjun, accompanied by Section Chief Zhang Rou, led a large number of police officers to the scene of the incident to mediate. Before long, Wang Dui, an adjunct officer of the Shanghai Naval Command, also arrived with a team and took both parties away to investigate the cause of the incident for review.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Commits Suicide: Female Photos Found on Person</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A traveler named Yang Yan (25 years old), who worked at the Capital Nanjing Bank, was found in Room 419 of the Yangshi Hotel on Hankou Road. Having just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, he committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills at 10:30 a.m. yesterday, for reasons unknown.

<h3>Evaluation of Cotton Cloth Prices: Further Discussion of Methods Today</h3>
<p>A reporter from the East China News Agency visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about whether the city government had any measures to suppress the recent surge in prices in the city. According to Mayor Wu, although the price surge is extremely serious, it can be suppressed in the short term. At present, the city has sufficient reserves of essential commodities such as rice, oil, and sugar, so there is no need to worry about shortages. As for the sharp rise in flour prices, the industry association has been ordered to automatically suppress them. In the coming days, representatives from relevant manufacturers in the industry and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be convened to discuss the joint establishment of a price evaluation committee. Although the Cotton Cloth Industry Evaluation Council was formally established on the afternoon of the 9th, it has not yet formally evaluated prices. With the weather getting colder, the sales of cotton cloth are bound to be brisk. If no measures are taken to stop it, it will not be a good solution. The city government decided to convene a discussion meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 11th, inviting responsible persons from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the Sixth District Textile Industry Association, and the China Textile Company to discuss price stabilization measures.</p>
<h3>Registration of Rickshaw Pullers Begins Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in view of the imminent deadline for the ban on rickshaws, has decided to begin registering rickshaw pullers today and issue owner certificates and rickshaw puller survey forms to ensure the smooth implementation of this work. The application period runs from today until the 25th of this month, and any applications submitted after this date will be considered abandoned. Owners of private rickshaws should bring their rickshaw licenses to the original vehicle registration office to obtain a rickshaw puller survey form, one for each rickshaw, fill it out in accordance with the instructions within three days, and return it to the original registration office. Owners of commercial rickshaws should obtain owner certificates and rickshaw puller survey forms, two for each rickshaw, fill them out in accordance with the instructions within three days, and submit them to the original registration office along with three photos of the owner, for review.</p>
<h3>Lively Streets on National Day: Three Traffic Accidents</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Double Ten National Day, and the traffic arteries were even more crowded than before, resulting in three traffic accidents in one day: (1) At 11:20 a.m., at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, a pedicab carrying two passengers was traveling east when it was suddenly overturned by a jeep. The rickshaw puller Wan Xingxian and passengers Liu Jianhua and Wu Shilin were all seriously injured. The police officer at the nearby post arrived and sent the three injured people to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. (2) At 7:45 a.m., schoolchildren Xu Caiqing (15 years old, from Shandong, residing at No. 16 Yuqing Lane, Yunnan South Road) and Han Changgen (13 years old, residing at No. 9 of the same lane) borrowed a bicycle because school was closed and were learning to ride in the Xizang Road Sanma Road area. Suddenly, a truck with license plate number 35471 sped by, and the two schoolchildren, who were not familiar with riding skills, collided with the truck, both suffering serious injuries. The police officer at the post stopped the driver Xia Qi and took him to the police station for questioning. At the same time, he summoned a car to rush the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. Xu Caiqing suffered internal injuries, which may be life-threatening. (3) At the south end of Zhapu Road Bridge, at 11:20 a.m., a transportation truck with license plate number Guo Hu 36144 injured pedestrians Chen Yicai (29 years old, residing at No. 25 Chenxiang Pavilion, Xinbeimen) and Shen Guobin (21 years old, residing at No. 201 Mingo Road, Hongkou), causing them to bleed from their heads. The police officer at the post arrested the driver involved in the accident and brought him to the Huangpu Police Bureau for investigation. The injured were taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Careless Fire in Bamboo House on Pushan Road</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A bamboo house at a certain number in Pushan Village, Pushan Road, Zhabei, caught fire at 11:30 a.m. yesterday due to carelessness. The bamboo houses in the surrounding area were burned down. Later, the Zhabei Fire Department rushed to the scene and put out the fire at around 12:00 p.m. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It is reported that the fire was caused by careless cooking. The person who started the fire was summoned by the Zhabei Police Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Passenger Dies After Jumping from Car</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:00 p.m. yesterday, a passenger on Guanghua Transportation Company's passenger truck No. 12637 jumped from the truck while it was traveling on Lujiabang Road near Daxing Street. As the truck was moving forward at high speed, the passenger fell to the ground and lost consciousness, bleeding profusely from the head. The truck driver Qin Jianxiang hired a pedicab to rush the passenger to the nearby Penglai Hospital for emergency treatment. Due to the severe impact, the lungs and brain were severely injured, and the passenger died despite all efforts to save him. A naval cadet school student on the same truck reported the incident to the Penglai Road Police Sub-bureau and requested that officers be sent to the scene of the accident for inspection. In the deceased's pocket, they found his photo and salary slips, with the name Chen Zhaoxiang written on them. They also found a Jiangxi Youth Army Homecoming Commemorative Badge, with the name Ao De written on it, making it unclear what his real name was. The body was sent to the Dongxinqiao Morgue for examination yesterday afternoon. The Penglai Sub-bureau questioned the truck driver. Passengers testified that the deceased did not ask the truck to stop before jumping, so it has been determined that the truck was not responsible. However, it was discovered that the truck did not have a license. Therefore, the truck has been impounded, and the owner has been summoned for questioning.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Queries</p>
<p>(1) Clever Seizure and Deprivation</p>
<p>Puzzled from Shanghai: Since its establishment in the spring of 1944, a certain industry has cleverly established various names and charged employees a fixed employment fee of 5,000 puppet currency per person (equivalent to more than two stones of white rice at the time). The fixed employment fees of all employees amounted to almost one-fifth of the entire capital of the factory. It was stated that it would be returned after three months, with interest of 5% during the custody period. However, it was not returned upon maturity. Until the beginning of August last year, the factory owner, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, still returned the 5,000 yuan, but did not calculate interest (equivalent to about five pancakes). At that time, due to the situation, they reluctantly took it back. Now that the sun shines again and justice can be done, all employees intend to make a claim for compensation from the employer, using the rice price at the time of payment as the standard, and to recover the interest. Is this legal? Can waiters be listed as one of the full employees of the industry? The industry earned tens of thousands of yuan in puppet currency in 1944. According to the factory's regulations, 8% of the profit should be given as a bonus to all employees, but waiters did not receive this bonus. Can they claim it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) If the right to claim damages was reserved when the payment was accepted, it can be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery. (2 &amp; 3) Waiters are also employees. If employees can distribute bonuses, then waiters can also claim them.</p>
<p>(2) Local Tyrants Run Rampant</p>
<p>Perplexed from Shangzhuoli: My father mortgaged a house to a local tyrant for 400 silver yuan in 1926 due to financial difficulties. After the expiration of the mortgage period, the tyrant refused to allow the redemption. We were unable to sue the tyrant in the local court in 1942. As a result, the court ordered us to redeem the house for 6,500 yuan. However, the tyrant still used delaying tactics to refuse the redemption. In March of this year, we again requested the original court to enforce the judgment. As a result, we paid 6,500 yuan to the court and recovered the house after compulsory execution. However, the tyrant refused to accept this and filed an appeal. At the end of May, the court ruled that "the original judgment is revoked, and the defendant should redeem the house from the plaintiff for 650,000 yuan." The reader has some knowledge of the law, but does not understand this miraculous judgment. Please explain this. Is there any way to save the situation?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui] The increased redemption price you inquired about may be based on the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3125 of 1936 and Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, requesting the court to make a judgment. If you are not satisfied with this, you can file an appeal within the statutory period.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Students Lack Warm Clothing: Biting Wind, Still Wearing Summer Clothes; Executive Yuan Relief Committee Provides 2,000 Packages of Old Clothes for Temporary Relief</h3>
<p>[Reported from Shenyang, October 10th by This Newspaper] Autumn has passed, and the biting wind is severe. The problem of warm clothing for students in universities and middle schools in the Northeast is extremely serious. The Executive Yuan Relief Committee has decided to provide relief by using 2,000 large packages of old clothes that have been shipped to the Northeast Branch, with each package containing between 150 and 160 items, for temporary relief for students. However, the materials of these old clothes are very mixed, and the sizes do not fit students. Therefore, it has been decided that within the week, the United Relief Administration and the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Committee will send people to organize an auction committee to purchase cotton cloth with the proceeds from the auction and weave new clothes for distribution to students. Among these old clothes, there are leather clothes in very good condition, and there are also clothes that are very tattered. Many students in the preparatory class of Northeastern University are still wearing summer clothes. They told reporters: "We are worried day and night about the problem of warm clothing," with great pain.</p>

<h3>Promoting Overseas Remittances - Proposed Approval for Exchange in Original Currency - Obstacles Arise Due to Failure to Eliminate the Black Market - New York Has the Most, Taxes Reduced in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This reporter recently visited the Bank of China to inquire about the bank's handling of overseas remittance business. It is understood that the recent overseas remittance situation has not seen significant progress. This is because there is a difference between the official exchange rate and the black market price of foreign currency. Furthermore, the general public's perception of foreign currency prices is mostly optimistic. Therefore, they all hope to be able to remit their money back to their home country in the original currency. However, if the remittance is handled through the bank, the amount is mostly converted into legal tender at the place of remittance. Therefore, overseas remittances from various places are mostly remitted to Hong Kong in the original currency. Recognizing this, the bank is considering implementing a method of remitting in the original currency, hoping to recover a large amount of overseas remittance funds. However, the implementation of this method will inevitably hinder the central bank's foreign exchange management to a considerable extent. It is currently studying solutions to overcome this problem in order to implement it in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the foreign exchange market in March of this year, the operation of overseas remittance business was entirely concentrated in this bank. After the opening of foreign exchange, designated banks operating remittance business may also operate at the same time, but the amount is not large. It is estimated that the overseas remittances handled by the bank account for at least one-half of the total amount of overseas remittances in the country. In the early days of restoration, the bank's handling of overseas remittances was hampered by the fact that telecommunications and transportation had not returned to normal, and remittances from New York to the Siyi region of Guangdong had to be transferred through the Chongqing or Shanghai head office. As a result, remittances took time. However, since this year, telegraphic transfers no longer need to be transferred through the head office. Also, since June 28th of this year, New York telegraphic transfers have been restored. Therefore, telegrams from New York can arrive in two or three days. The recipient can receive the money in three or four days from the date of remittance. Even telegraphic transfers between New York and various parts of the Siyi region of Guangdong take only about eight days.</p>
<h3>Remittance Statistics</h3>
<p>In terms of the amount of overseas remittances from various places, the Southeast Asian regions used to be in the leading position before the war. Now, the restrictions on overseas remittances in the British Southeast Asian region are very strict. Overseas remittances from the Dutch Southeast Asian region have almost completely stopped due to the impact of the war. Furthermore, many parts of Southeast Asia have been affected by military operations, and overseas Chinese have suffered heavy losses, almost bordering on bankruptcy. Therefore, remittances from this region have sharply declined after the restoration. Since August of this year, the amount of overseas remittances from various places, New York (including Canada and the American mainland) has been in the leading position, accounting for about 80% of the bank's total overseas remittances. Next are London (including the British mainland), Cuba, Australia, the Philippines, India, Burma, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Hanoi and other places. The bank's monthly overseas remittance amounts since August of this year are listed below:</p>
<p>January 2,181,832,554 yuan</p>
<p>February 1,065,280,497 yuan</p>
<p>(The above is calculated at 500 yuan per US dollar national currency.)</p>
<p>March 4,748,490,000</p>
<p>April 8,619,609,930</p>
<p>May 6,288,944,581</p>
<p>June 5,790,334,839</p>
<p>July 4,061,720,261</p>
<p>August 8,300,993,615</p>
<p>(The above is calculated at 2,020 yuan per US dollar national currency before August 19th. From this day onwards, it is calculated at 3,350 yuan per US dollar national currency.)</p>
<h3>Taiwan Rice and Coal Awaiting Shipment - Rice Quality Similar to Changshu and Wuxi Goods</h3>
<p>[Taiwan 9th] This year's harvest in Taiwan Province is abundant, and the late rice harvest is excellent. The quality of the Ponlai rice produced is excellent, with large grains and a shiny color, comparable to rice from Vietnam and other places, and even better than top-quality rice from Changshu and Wuxi. A batch has already been concentrated in the Keelung warehouse, awaiting shipment to Shanghai. Also, the production of Taiwan coal has increased greatly in recent days, exceeding self-sufficiency figures. There is also a large amount of inventory awaiting shipment to Shanghai. According to relevant sources, Taiwan Province's abundant rice harvest and increased coal production will not be a problem to transport and sell. However, the main task of transporting grain out of the country for sale is how to stabilize rice prices on the island and strictly prevent hoarding and smuggling.</p>
<h3>Wool Scarves Obtained from Australia</h3>
<p>Yihe Company at 45 Changxing Lane, Henan Middle Road, this city, recently obtained a large number of pure wool scarves from Australia, priced affordably. Many major department stores both locally and from other places have purchased them, and the current inventory is said to be running low.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Business Conference Opens Today in Beijing - Conference is Scheduled for One Week</h3>

It is reported that the Central Bank's business conference this time has more than 400 proposals, mostly related to business and treasury aspects. It is also heard that important discussions will be held on financial strategies after the conference. Therefore, today's conference will first organize small group meetings to study the proposals separately, merge them for preliminary review, and then submit them to the general meeting for discussion. The conference will last for a week, and Bei will return to Shanghai after the conference closes.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the provisions of the Industrial Association Law, the Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered that important industrial associations in Shanghai should be reorganized in accordance with the standards set by the central government.

<h3>窰府觀光</h3>
<p>— September 28th, Fuliang Dispatch. Special Correspondent Yu Ning quite thoroughly</p>
<p>At first glance of the Kiln Prefecture, the outward appearance is one of prosperity and affluence. However, if one delves into the arduous journey behind the prosperity, one will find deeply hidden shadows of decline and decay.</p>
<p>Jingde is one of the four great towns of our country, under the jurisdiction of Fuliang in northern Jiangxi, and also the only major port in the interior of Jiangxi. Since the large-scale renovation overseen by the Fifth District Commissioner in the 21st year of the Republic, the prosperity of the streets far exceeds that of Jiujiang. The extravagance of the atmosphere and the grandeur of the city's appearance are comparable to Nanchang, the provincial capital. The reporter, having abruptly arrived in this place from a quiet and desolate rural area, felt a refreshing change of scenery. The towering chimneys, swirling like clouds, indicate the abundance of factories. The closely packed city houses and the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds suggest the large population. The entertainment venues and restaurants are always filled with guests, bustling until dawn, further demonstrating the extravagant spending habits of the people in this porcelain town.</p>
<p>The City Walls Remain, But the People Have Changed</p>
<p>In the eleventh year of the Republic, the reporter was stationed in Jingde to promote the sales of the Shanghai newspaper. I had a strong impression of Zhushan, and had been away for more than twenty years. This time, visiting the Kiln Prefecture again, I felt like Ding Lingwei returning as a crane. The city walls remained, but the people had changed. However, the town has no city walls. Only in the villages bordering the town's outskirts, half a fortress-like brick bastion with battlements remains. Most of the original residential houses have been transformed into Western-style buildings. The muddy and sloped streets have also been transformed into wide concrete roads. The former outline no longer exists.</p>
<p>A stranger who suddenly arrives at the Kiln Prefecture cannot help but admire the prosperity of the outward appearance and envy it as an area rich in special products. However, if one goes to explore the arduous journey behind its prosperity, one will find many deeply hidden facts of decline and decay. This only important town in the Jiangxi hinterland relies on porcelain for its sustenance and prosperity. Speaking of porcelain, whether domestic or foreign, everyone knows that Jingde porcelain is the most famous. Jingde porcelain, famous throughout the world, is also a unique product of this area, supplying the needs of the entire country and the European and American countries. Of course, demand exceeds supply, and business is naturally booming. Why should one worry about sluggish sales, retreating into a declining path? There are many complex reasons for this decline hidden within. The reporter dares not claim to have a clear and insightful view, but can only take a superficial look, like a fleeting glimpse while riding a horse, and gather information about the past and present conditions. I will roughly write them down below:</p>
<p>A Comprehensive Exploration of Jingde Porcelain Production and Transportation</p>
<p>Ceramics are made from mineral soil that is processed and fired. The creation of ceramics in our country began in ancient times. The Tongjian mentions the event of "The Yellow Emperor ordering Ning Feng to be the Ceramic Administrator." The Historical Records mention "Dancing with pottery on the riverbank." Zou Yang's poem in the Han Dynasty says, "The mellow brew is complete, the green porcelain is opened." From this, it can be known that there were glaze decorations in the Han Dynasty. It is difficult to examine in which era Jingde porcelain began. According to the Fuliang County Chronicle, "Xinping started smelting pottery in the Han Dynasty." During the Six Dynasties period, in the second year of Zhi De during the Chen Dynasty, the Fuguo Hall was built in Jiankang, and Xinping was ordered to contribute pottery bases, which were intricately carved but not strong. Xinping is Jingde Town, so it can be known that Jingde porcelain already had considerable technology in the Six Dynasties.</p>
<p>There are thirteen types of porcelain clay: (1) Donggang Glaze Fruit, (2) Mingsha Kaolin, (3) Xingzi Kaolin, (4) Qimen Porcelain Clay, (5) Shouxi Porcelain Clay, (6) Leping Porcelain Clay, (7) Guixi Porcelain Clay, (8) Yugan Porcelain Clay, (9) Anren Porcelain Clay, (10) Linchuan Porcelain Clay, (11) Sanbaopeng Porcelain Clay, (12) Yinkengwu Porcelain Clay, (13) Chenwan Porcelain Clay. (1) Donggang Glaze Fruit is produced in Yaoli, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 110 li from the town. (2) Mingsha Kaolin is produced in Gaoling, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 90 li from the town. (3) Xingzi Porcelain Clay is produced in Xingzi County, more than 400 li from the town. (4) Qimen Porcelain Clay is produced in the southeast and west of Qimen, Anhui, varying from 40 to 50 li from the town. (5) Shouxi Porcelain Clay is produced in Shouxi, Dongxiang, Fuliang, 60 li from the town. (6) Leping Porcelain Clay is produced in the Heilin Village, Nancheng, Leping, 350 li from the town by waterway. (7) Guixi Porcelain Clay is produced in Guixi County, 340 li from the town. (8) Yugan Porcelain Clay is produced in Yugan County, 280 li from the town. (9) Anren Porcelain Clay is produced in Yujiang County, 300 li from the town. (10) Linchuan Porcelain Clay, like Guixi, Yugan, and Anren Porcelain Clay, is used for making blanks. (11) Sanbaopeng, Yinkengwu, and Chenwan Porcelain Clay are all produced in Fuliang, from 30 to 50 li to 70 to 80 li from the town, with abundant production.</p>
<p>Jingde Town is located in the northeast of Jiangxi and the southwest of Fuliang. In the fifth year of the Republic, the county seat was moved to the town. To the north, it connects to Qiupu and Qimen; to the east, it borders Wuyuan; to the south, it connects to Leping; and to the west, it connects to Poyang. The only waterway is the Chang River, which originates from the Dahong Mountain in northern Qimen County, Anhui, and flows southwest through Jingde Town into Poyang Lake. However, the mountains, rivers, and water sources are too small to accommodate steamships. It relies solely on sailboats and small sculling barges for transportation. Before the construction of highways in the twentieth year of the Republic, the export of all porcelain produced in the town relied entirely on transportation by boats and carts. The risks and difficulties were a major obstacle to the promotion of Jingde porcelain. After the Jinghu, Tunjing, Nanfu, and Wujing highways were opened to traffic one after another in the 21st year of the Republic, land transportation gradually became more convenient. After the Jingde to Huangjinbu section of the Beijing-Guizhou trunk line was opened to traffic and connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in the 23rd year of the Republic, travel became even more convenient. If this road is fully completed and opened to traffic, the transportation and promotion of Jingde porcelain will naturally be smooth and unimpeded.</p>
<p>Porcelain Sales and Export Value</p>
<p>The sales market of Jingde porcelain is the most famous and unparalleled special product in the country. There is no need to worry about sluggish sales. The needs of various parties extend to all provinces of the country and as far as the Nanyang and European and American countries. The various porcelain factories do not directly transport and sell their products to various places. They rely entirely on merchants from various places stationed in the town to purchase. There are often more than twenty merchant guilds stationed in the town, including Tianjin, Guangzhou, Guandong, Tongxin, Tongqing, Huangma, Makou, Sanyi, Liangzi, Xiaogan, Guoshan, Hunan, Henan, Ningshao, Chuanxiang, Tongcheng, Fengxi, Beiping, Yangzhou, Jindou, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Neihe, Kangshan, Qingdao, Shandong, Singapore, and Siam.</p>
<p>During the most prosperous period, there were more than 3,000 kiln factories in the town, and more than 100,000 porcelain workers were employed. The total value of porcelain exports was more than six or seven million taels per year. In the third year of the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, the export volume of porcelain was more than 66,000 dan. In the third year of the Guangxu period, it was only more than 11,300 dan. In the third year of the Xuantong period, it increased again to more than 59,700 dan. In the third year of the Republic, it increased again to more than 66,600 dan. By the 18th year of the Republic, it had further increased to more than 127,860 dan. In the 22nd year, it dropped again to more than 54,700 dan. The total export value was less than 4 million yuan. Although there was a slight increase after the 22nd year, there was still no significant improvement. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the difficulty of transportation, the entire porcelain industry almost came to a standstill. In the year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the kiln factories once restored their former appearance and worked hard to produce, but soon returned to a state of quiet idleness. The high places of Zhushan could not withstand the cold, and were blown by the cool autumn wind in a lazy manner, seemingly with a bleak autumn atmosphere and a listless, tired look.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, the Jingde Town Imperial Kiln Factory was established. During the Qianlong period, Tang Ying, an official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, supervised the construction of the Imperial Kiln Factory, gathering craftsmen and talents, studying and refining skills. At that time, various factories competed to show their beauty, innovating every day. Sales were very smooth in the country and in the Nanyang ports, and Jingde porcelain became a golden age.</p>
<p>Complex Categories of Porcelain Kiln Factories</p>
<p>Porcelain kiln factories are divided into complex categories. Based on the abbreviation of the workshops, there are three types: kiln factory store. The factory that manufactures porcelain blanks and refractory boxes is called the day factory. The place that manages the firing of porcelain is called the kiln. The place that decorates the colors of porcelain is called the red shop. Furthermore, based on the nature of the business, there are five industries: porcelain making, kiln firing, painting, refractory box making, and straw binding. Among them, (A) the categories belonging to round wares are (1) Four Major Wares Industry (2) Two White Glaze Industry (3) Bodiless Wares Industry (4) Rice Bowl Industry (5) Four Winter Small Wares Industry (6) Ke Ware Ash Slag Ware Industry (7) Antique Ware Industry (8) Wine Set Cup Industry (9) Seven-Five Inch Industry, (B) the categories belonging to carved wares are (1) Large Piece Industry (2) Powder Setting Industry (3) Carving Industry (4) Official Cover Industry (5) Light Sketching Industry (6) Soapstone Industry (7) Needle Spoon Industry (8) Spoon Industry (9) Antique Jar Industry (10) Lamp Industry (11) Antique Ware Industry. (C) The categories belonging to kiln firing are (1) Wood Kiln Industry (2) Raft Kiln Industry (D) The categories belonging to painting are (1) Freehand Painting Industry (2) Powder Ancient Painting Industry (3) Fine Arts Painting Industry (4) Huangjia Zhou Porcelain Decoration Industry (E) (1) Large Ware Refractory Box Industry (2) Small Ware Refractory Box Industry.</p>
<p>The workers in each trade, (1) those belonging to the round ware category include stewards, odd job workers, blank makers, blank finishers, glaziers, assistant blank makers, apprentices, cooks, (2) those belonging to kiln firing include kiln masters, blank diggers, frame carriers, residue removers, refractory box loaders, small fire hands, three-and-a-half workers, two-and-a-half workers, one-and-a-half workers, box carriers, scraping workers, porters, supervisors, (3) those belonging to raft kiln factories include kiln masters, weight makers, big hammer strikers, sand cap removers, refractory box loaders, small fire hands, red half-share workers, black half-share workers, odd job workers, supervisors, apprentices, raft counters, raft carriers, kiln supervisors, (4) those belonging to painting include workers, painters, color applicators, (5) those belonging to refractory box making include pushing workers, soil mixers, refractory box makers, (6) those belonging to straw binding include trimming straw, packaging, indigo dyeing, odd job workers, porters. In total, before the 22nd year of the Republic, there were more than 2,800 companies in the above industries. After the 23rd year, it decreased to 1,060 companies.</p>
<p>The procedures for porcelain making, glazing, and decorating are extremely numerous. For example, (A) porcelain making methods, (1) blank clay preparation, (i) mixing, (ii) clay kneading, (2) blank making, (i) potter's wheel blank making, (ii) mold pressing, (iii) blank finishing, (iv) glazing, (v) egret blanking, (vi) water replenishing, (vii) carving blank making, (viii) mold blank making, (ix) casting blank making, (x) drying prevention, (3) refractory box kiln firing, refractory box making includes clay refining, slicing, pottery eastward forming, fire resistance grading, kiln firing includes stacking, arranging, fire matching, fire seizing, fire sliding, fire tightening, slow firing large and small, kiln unloading. (B) There are two types of glazing: (1) white glaze, (2) colored glaze. Glazing methods are also divided into (1) dipping glaze, (2) pouring glaze, (3) pouring glaze, (4) coating glaze, (5) blowing glaze. (C) There are two types of decoration: (1) blue and white, (2) colored flowers. Blue and white includes sky blue, bean green, winter green and several others. Colored flowers include rouge red, carmine red, top red, middle red, Guangcui, top green, gold green, emerald green, furnace jun green, glass white, old yellow, top yellow, big green, bitter green, black gold, ancient big green, local green, glue material, fine powder material, pearl material. Real gold, ancient bronze, white filling, snow white, sweet blue, black material, ochre, foreign gold, Western red, Western red, and more than thirty other kinds. Coloring methods are also divided into (1) circle filling method, (2) drawing method, (3) applique method, (4) printing method, (5) scratching method, (6) blowing color method, (7) patting color method.</p>
<p>Many Raw Materials Needed for Kiln Manufacturing</p>
<p>The raw materials for porcelain making are kiln firewood and porcelain clay. Jingde Town kiln firewood completely uses pine firewood and thatch firewood as fuel. Pine firewood is needed extremely much, thatch firewood is less. The source of pine firewood (1) is from mining and logging in Qiyuan and Qimen and other places, transported down the Chang River, self-mountain-mounted town, (2) is from Yujiang, Yugan, Leping, Xingzi, Duchang, Pengze, Hukou, Linchuan, guide office self-transport to Poyang, sailing up the Chang River, close to more than a hundred miles, far to hundreds of miles, there are firewood protection public offices, specializing in helping secret households cooperate to handle firewood materials.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Reverse the Decline of the Porcelain Industry</p>
<p>The unique porcelain products in the country have a total export value of more than sixty or seventy million taels per year, and more than 100,000 employed porcelain workers. Furthermore, porcelain merchants from various places come from afar. The kiln factory stores are divided into categories, and each is prosperous and numerous. It is entirely a decentralized handicraft industry with unrestricted management and operations. In total, the scope cannot be considered narrow, and the business cannot be considered small. In this kind of large-scale enterprise with division of labor and cooperation, in companies and factories with organization, management, technology, and methods, there are often labor-capital disputes, and even strikes and occupational incidents occur. How much more so in this decentralized handicraft industry without economic organization, clinging to outdated rules and unwilling to improve, unwilling to accommodate customers, unwilling to broaden recruitment, and unwilling to seek improvement? Labor-capital conflicts and intra-industry struggles are, of course, natural facts. However, because the porcelain industry is a free industry without management, its crisis of decline is hidden within. Various unreasonable and untimely weaknesses that can lead to the decline of the industry are also nakedly exposed!</p>
<p>The blame does not lie with the original porcelain merchants and porcelain workers. The decline of the entire porcelain industry cannot be reversed by the efforts of ordinary porcelain merchants and porcelain workers. According to the reporter's observations, the failure of the porcelain industry can be summarized as follows: (1) lack of government support, (2) lack of guidance and management organizations, (3) excessively weak financial resources, (4) immaturity in technical aspects, (5) inconvenience in transportation, (6) inappropriateness of personnel, (7) excessive mobility of porcelain workers, unstable life, (8) eagerness for quick success and instant benefits, seeking effects too quickly, (9) deeply ingrained bad habits, causing disgust, (10) lack of a fixed standard normal market price. With these ten causes, the Jingde porcelain industry can only walk on the narrow side path, and it is difficult to turn to the hope of a bright and smooth future.</p>
<h3>Autumn Arrives in the South</h3>
<p>— 6th Guangzhou Aerial Dispatch. Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived! In the warm south, although the autumn wind blows in gusts at night, the scorching sun still shines during the day, as if it were the end of summer. Only the ladies who are most sensitive to the seasons have already changed into various autumn cheongsams and put on thin jackets. This seems to be the warning sign of autumn's arrival. The merchants' sense of smell for the seasons is not slow either. They have already prepared everything for the arrival of autumn. The glass windows of department stores display many seasonal daily necessities such as wool, gloves, and thin woolen fabrics. Western clothing stores have also removed "Summer Suitings" and replaced them with various autumn wools shipped from ocean liners. Ice rooms have also changed to selling wonton noodles long ago! Even gold and Hong Kong dollars seem to be affected by the change of seasons, constantly creating waves. Hong Kong dollars jumped from 750 to 930 in a week, and gold also rose from 270,000 to over 280,000, thereby driving up prices to follow suit, making people feel that the arrival of autumn has a new stimulation and a new threat.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is due to the increased prices caused by financial fluctuations that the lives of ordinary people are becoming more difficult day by day. Because of the difficulty of life, social order is becoming more and more chaotic. Guangzhou has been restored for more than a year! In theory, everything should be gradually getting on track. Not to mention that the public should be able to recuperate and rest, at the very least, it should not be as difficult as it is now! In the early stages of restoration, the municipal authorities' series of plans, although not yet realized, at least gave everyone spiritual comfort and infinite expectations. However, this "pie in the sky" has now become a bad check, and the citizens are disappointed! Isn't it? When we look at Guangzhou now, there is really nothing good about it. Let's talk about public security first. Although the police authorities have made their best efforts, sending large teams of police to patrol every day, and searching public buses at any time, robbery cases still occur continuously. Every day, the social news section of the newspaper has at least three to five eye-catching titles such as "Armed Robbery," "Peeling Dead Cows," "Burglary," and "Civilized Thief Stealing Handbags." Now it is only autumn, and public security is already like this. Soon winter will come, and winter is the season when public security is most difficult to maintain. What's more, in this increasingly difficult life, some people will inevitably be unable to withstand the pressure of cold and hunger and take risks. At that time, there will be more robbery cases, and the lives and property of citizens will be even more difficult to protect!</p>
<p>In the midst of the "Traffic Safety Movement," car accidents have almost become a daily issue in Guangzhou. It's not just that cars run over people. There are even many cases of cars driving onto sidewalks and smashing traffic police booths. The highest record of car accidents is as many as four cases in one day, and in most cases, the drivers flee after the accident. Citizens walking on the road are all in danger, and newspapers are calling on the authorities to take effective measures, but the authorities have not yet made a formal statement. It is likely that the "Traffic Safety Movement" is just a slogan! Therefore, one reporter suggested that, for the sake of citizen safety, short walls should be built on both sides of the road, or the traffic lanes should be dug one or two feet deep to prevent cars from going over. Although this suggestion is humorous, given the current chaotic traffic situation in Guangzhou, it seems that there is no other way.</p>
<p>Some people say that one of the reasons for the high number of car accidents is that the roads are uneven. Then you may ask, why don't they repair the roads? This question has already been answered clearly by Chen Guoji, the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. He said, "Due to lack of funds, most of the bureau's plans for the 35th year have not yet been implemented. For example, the major plans for the ring road personally planned by Mayor Chen (former Mayor Chen Ce) have become empty bubbles. Secondly, there is the historical Haizhu Bridge, whose dilapidated condition has reached a dangerous stage. The bridge foundation is already tilted. If it cannot be fully repaired by the end of this year, all vehicles will be prohibited from traveling on it in the short term to avoid danger. Recently, Mayor Ouyang has consulted with the port authorities and requested to borrow repair equipment, which has been agreed to, but work can only begin when funds are available." Therefore, the repair of the roads depends on the availability of funds.</p>

<h3>Modern Medical Treatment of Peptic Ulcers (1)</h3>
<p>— Xue Bangqi</p>
<p>When the term "peptic ulcer" (including gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers) is mentioned, everyone knows it is a chronic disease that is not easily cured. Due to the special nature of the structure and function of the digestive organs, which work and secrete constantly day and night, coupled with their particular sensitivity to nerves, emotions, or any external stimuli, the treatment of peptic ulcers is by no means as simple as most people imagine. Before treatment, we must consider the patient's environment, understand the patient's mood, explore the root of the disease, and carefully examine the condition of other parts and systems of the patient's body. We must prescribe medication according to the symptoms, either treating the source of the disease first, or supporting the patient's physical strength first, or calming the symptoms first, handling them step by step according to their importance, based on reason and emotion. The attending physician must not only have a wealth of knowledge but also be very alert to various factors, following the proper procedures. Therefore, mechanical and rigid treatment methods are often difficult to apply in practice. However, there are generally recognized principles in medicine that we must understand clearly, grasp the essentials, and provide appropriate treatment methods according to the different individual conditions.</p>
<p>The principles of treatment for peptic ulcers can be discussed under the following categories:</p>
<p>(A) General Treatment</p>
<p>General treatment is necessary for any disease. Peptic ulcer is a chronic disease, which occupies a more important position. It is a prerequisite for successful treatment and should be listed on the first page for review:</p>
<p>(1) Physical and Mental Rest</p>
<p>Rest is the most important thing in treatment. This is a medical canon in both ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. However, the term "rest" refers to both physical and mental aspects. Physical rest is external and relatively easy to achieve, while mental rest is mental and psychological and often difficult to implement. Patients must maintain an optimistic belief because mental instability, depression, and stimulation can easily affect the sensitive gastrointestinal tract, causing serious reactions. To give a clear example: if we suddenly receive bad news while eating, we will immediately feel a dullness in the stomach and a loss of appetite. This is the reaction of the gastrointestinal tract after being affected by stimulation.</p>
<p>(2) Local Rest</p>
<p>This rest includes avoiding external shaking, cold, or other physical stimuli to the local area of the gastrointestinal tract, and finding ways to reduce or regulate the secretion and contraction work of the stomach, giving a diseased organ more opportunities to rest. This need is obvious and need not be elaborated.</p>
<p>(3) Eliminate Internal Foci of Infection</p>
<p>The spread of infection from any part of the body and its constant dissemination of toxins can cause the occurrence of peptic ulcers or increase the severity of their symptoms. Therefore, during the treatment period, we must carefully examine other systems for the existence of foci of infection. Whether it is tonsillitis, sinusitis, chronic appendicitis, various inflammatory conditions in the female pelvis, or chronic symptoms of other systems, they must be treated radically as much as possible to avoid causing harm.</p>
<p>(4) Eliminate Various Toxins in the Body</p>
<p>If toxins are found in any part of the body, such as intestinal toxins caused by constipation, it is essential to find ways to eliminate them at any time and not ignore them. The patient's bowel movements should be smooth every day. When constipated, enemas and other methods can be used to eliminate them. It is also best to avoid foods to which individuals are sensitive or prone to adverse reactions, such as crabs and other seasonal foods.</p>
<p>(5) Personal Hygiene</p>
<p>Personal daily life should be regular. Attention should also be paid to issues such as daily living, warmth and cold, sunshine and air, and other cleanliness and hygiene issues, as they have a close impact on the course of the disease.</p>
<p>(B) Gastric Acid Neutralization Treatment and Dietary Regulation</p>
<p>(Sippy Therapy)</p>
<p>Gastric acid neutralization is the most commonly used treatment method for peptic ulcers in modern times. It was pioneered by Dr. Bertram W. Sippy, who believed that the main obstacle to the healing of peptic ulcers is that gastric acid has a decomposition and digestive effect on the gastric mucosa or duodenal mucosa. Gastric acid first damages the blood circulation of the local gastric and intestinal mucosa, and then the nutrition is cut off, the resistance disappears, resulting in ulceration. If we can control gastric acid and neutralize it, the ulcers in the stomach and intestines can gradually heal.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, Sippy devised three major principles for treating peptic ulcers: (1) gastric acid neutralization, (2) dietary regulation, and (3) gastric lavage. He firmly believed that ulcers could gradually heal and physiological functions could gradually recover under this principle of treatment.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, the medical community in various countries has worked hard to conduct large-scale research on the treatment of peptic ulcers. Although the results obtained have different views, on the whole, they generally conform to Sippy's theory and treatment methods. Therefore, Sippy's therapy is still adopted by the medical community today, with only slight modifications depending on the condition of the disease.</p>
<p>(1) Gastric Acid Neutralization</p>
<p>Sippy used alkaline powders as the main medicine for gastric acid neutralization. There are two types of these powders: the first type is a mixed powder of 0.6 grams of heavy magnesium oxide and 0.6 grams of sodium bicarbonate, and the second type is a mixed powder of 0.6 grams of calcium carbonate (or calcium carbonate) and 1.2 to 1.0 grams of sodium bicarbonate. The method of administration is to take one dose of the first or second type of powder in rotation between meals.</p>
<p>Sippy's powder is very effective for neutralization. The magnesium oxide and calcium carbonate in it can be used to regulate bowel movements, the former for laxative purposes, and the latter for anti-diarrheal purposes.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of alkaline drugs for peptic ulcers, the modern medical community also has very detailed research. It has always been believed that the most ideal and standard alkaline drug should have the following conditions: (1) insoluble in gastric juice; (2) non-irritating to the gastrointestinal tract; (3) maintains neutrality when made into a uniform suspension, but can neutralize acidic liquids; (4) does not change the acid-base balance in the body; (5) the daily dose does not turn the urine into a strong alkaline state, causing phosphorus crystals to precipitate in the kidneys or urethra; (6) no constipation or diarrhea effect; (7) no change in other metabolic processes.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, we believe that the sodium bicarbonate used by Sippy is not completely satisfactory. It is soluble in water, and taking too much or too long can cause the risk of acidosis. Furthermore, as reported by Chamberlin and Lookwood, sodium bicarbonate can continue to cause gastric acid secretion after taking it. Based on the above facts, we can carefully examine the individual condition and consider replacing sodium bicarbonate with calcium carbonate to avoid some of the adverse reactions.</p>
<p>(2) Dietary Regulation</p>
<p>Dietary regulation for peptic ulcers mostly also follows Sippy's method. Its main condition is to provide patients with sufficient nutrition without gastrointestinal irritation. Therefore, regular, small, frequent meals are an ideal method. The choice of food is limited to those that are nourishing, soft, and non-irritating. At the same time, alkaline drugs must be taken in rotation to neutralize gastric acid.</p>
<p>We can only devise a very simple dietary outline. As for the detailed allocation or the speed of increase or decrease in the type and amount of food, it can only be handled at the discretion of the patient's symptoms. Strict dietary regulation should last for at least three to six weeks.</p>
<p>After a peptic ulcer is diagnosed, for the first two days, the patient can drink about three ounces of a mixed drink of half fresh milk and half yogurt. From 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., once an hour. Between the diets before and after, one dose of each of the two Sippy's powders must be taken in rotation. After two days, if the situation is good, a soda cracker or toast can be added to the diet in the morning. A small amount of thin porridge or oatmeal can be added to the diet in the afternoon. From then on, according to the condition of the disease, a small amount of soft, simple, and non-irritating diet can be added daily. After a full week, in addition to three ounces of milk and yogurt each time, the patient's diet can be supplemented with two or three eggs a day (scrambled eggs or various tender eggs are acceptable), and two or three times of thin porridge or oatmeal or stewed noodles, but limited to two or three ounces each time. Patients who are not accustomed to drinking milk can use soybean milk or other nourishing liquid intermittently instead. After another week or two, the patient's diet can be divided into five or six meals a day. Many foods, such as bread, white steamed buns, mashed fish, chicken, or vegetable leaves, porridge, noodles, and cooked fruits, can be included in the diet.</p>
<p>(3) Gastric Lavage</p>
<p>Gastric lavage is most beneficial for cases with pyloric obstruction and food retention. Washing once every day before going to bed can remove all acidic food retention in the stomach that day and reduce the time the ulcer is exposed to gastric acid. Medically, we can perform an acidity test on the retention to serve as a reference for increasing or decreasing the dosage of alkaline drugs. On the patient's side, after irrigation, they can sleep very comfortably that night.</p>
<h3>Talking About Rabies</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wenbing</p>
<p>Proper Prevention Can Eradicate This Disease</p>
<p>Rabies, also known as hydrophobia or mad dog disease, is an infectious disease of warm-blooded animals. This disease is most easily transmitted by dogs, but other animals such as wolves, foxes, and cats can also be infected. Humans can contract this disease after being bitten by a mad dog (mad cat or mad wolf, etc.). According to general statistics, not everyone bitten by a mad dog will contract this disease. About sixteen out of a hundred people are infected, and children are more easily infected than adults. This disease exists in various European and American countries, but so far, advanced public health countries, with proper prevention, have almost eradicated it. There are still many patients in our country, indicating that preventive measures have not been fully implemented. The etiology, transmission route, pathology, symptoms, and diagnosis of rabies will be briefly discussed below, and the prevention methods will be described in detail for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Etiology and Transmission Route: The pathogen is a filterable virus, which exists in the nervous system and salivary glands of the patient. Saliva is the medium for the transmission of this disease, which is transmitted to the nervous system through wounds or mucous membranes. This filterable toxin is easily killed by disinfectants, sunlight, and high temperatures.</p>
<p>(2) Pathology: The important pathological changes are all in the nervous system; the brain and spinal cord membranes often show congestion and bleeding points. Negri bodies can be found in the cerebellum, cerebrum, pons, spinal cord, and salivary glands, and there are many white blood cell accumulations around the blood vessels and nerve cells, especially around the cells of the motor nerve ganglia.</p>
<p>(3) Symptoms: The length of the incubation period (the period from contact with the infection to the onset of symptoms is called the incubation period) is related to the following points:</p>
<p>(A) Location of the Wound: The closer the wound is to the brain, the shorter the incubation period. Generally, the head and face have the shortest incubation period, followed by the upper limbs, and then the lower limbs.</p>
<p>(B) Amount and Strength of the Toxin: The greater the amount of toxin and the stronger the toxin, the shorter the incubation period; conversely, the longer the incubation period.</p>
<p>(C) Size and Depth of the Wound: The larger or deeper the wound, the shorter the incubation period; if the wound only affects the surface, or is covered by clothing, the longer the incubation period.</p>
<p>After being bitten by a mad dog, humans usually develop the disease between three weeks and eight weeks, with the shortest being eight days and the longest being one or two years. The main symptoms are two: (1) mental confusion, (2) paralysis. Clinically, it can be divided into three stages:</p>
<p>(A) The First Stage is the Prodromal Period: The wound where the toxin enters the body mostly heals quickly, and the resulting scar has no uncomfortable feeling. During the prodromal period, the wound often has numbness or itching sensations. The patient often feels irritable, uneasy, irritable, headache, insomnia, throat tightness, hoarseness, and difficulty swallowing, with a slightly elevated body temperature. After one or two days, the patient enters the excitement period.</p>
<p>(B) The Second Stage is the Excitement Period: The patient is extremely uneasy and in a state of terror. The pharyngeal muscles are particularly sensitive. Although the patient is thirsty, each attempt to drink causes spasms in the pharyngeal muscles, making it impossible to swallow. Sometimes seeing a drink or hearing the sound of flowing water causes spasms in the pharyngeal muscles, resembling a fear of water, hence the name hydrophobia. Minor external stimuli can also cause local or systemic spasms. During the non-spasm period, the patient is still conscious and in great pain. The body temperature is often higher than in the first stage, sometimes rising above 40 degrees Celsius, and occasionally there is no fever. During this period, the patient often dies from exhaustion; otherwise, after two or three days, the patient reaches the paralysis period.</p>
<p>(C) The Third Stage is the Paralysis Period: The patient gradually becomes stable, the spasms cease, and the patient gradually enters a coma and a state of systemic paralysis. Within a few hours, the patient dies of heart failure. The entire course of the disease is about four to five days.</p>
<p>(4) Diagnosis: The diagnosis of this disease is not difficult after the onset of the disease; the patient has a history of being bitten by a dog and has spasmodic symptoms of the pharyngeal muscles, which can be confirmed. If the dog dies for no other reason within ten days, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>(5) Treatment: After the onset of the disease, the patient is destined to die, without a single survivor. Therefore, all treatments focus on symptomatic aspects, giving a large amount of sedatives to reduce the patient's pain. At the same time, the patient should be isolated to avoid harming others. Therefore, after being bitten by a mad dog, the patient must never believe in various folk remedies and herbal treatments, trifling with life. They should be sent to the hospital immediately for preventive injections to avoid the danger of developing the disease and dying.</p>
<p>(6) Prevention: Prevention can be divided into active and passive prevention. In countries that implement active prevention, the disease has long been eradicated. Implementing passive prevention can avoid the occurrence of the disease and reduce the mortality rate.</p>
<p>(A) Active Prevention: Stray dogs abound in various parts of our country, which not only hinder traffic but also serve as a medium for rabies, harming human lives. Therefore, stray dogs without owners should be captured and killed as soon as possible; dog owners should be required to obtain licenses from the local public security bureau for their owned dogs, hanging them on the dog's head and neck to distinguish them from stray dogs. Dogs should be muzzled when going out to avoid biting people. Dogs that go out without licenses should also be captured. If a dog develops rabies, it should be killed immediately.</p>
<p>(B) Passive Prevention: After a person is bitten by a dog, they must try to catch the dog to prove whether the dog is mad; at the same time, first aid treatment should be given to the local wound. If the dog is suspected of being mad, Pasteur vaccine should be injected immediately.</p>
<p>There are two ways to identify a mad dog:</p>
<p>(A) Isolate the dog for several days to observe whether it has this disease. If the dog has this disease, it usually dies within ten days.</p>
<p>(B) Kill the dog and examine its brain for Negri bodies. If found, it can be proved that the dog has this disease. Alternatively, the dog's medullary fluid can be inoculated into the brains of guinea pigs. If it is a mad dog, the guinea pigs will show symptoms within nine to twelve days.</p>
<p>Local Treatment: Disinfect the bite wound and cauterize the wound with a hot iron or concentrated nitric acid, or corrode the tissue of the bitten area with pure carbolic acid to kill the filterable toxin.</p>
<p>Pasteur Preventive Injection: If the dog that bites a person is suspected of being mad, preventive vaccine should be injected immediately. This method was invented by Pasteur before 1940, using toxin-containing specially prepared rabbit spinal cord injected on a regular basis. The method is to inject one dose of vaccine subcutaneously every day for a total of fourteen to twenty-one days, usually fourteen days. After injection, the number of outbreaks is reduced from 16% to below 1%. Most of those for whom the injection is ineffective are due to the injection being too late, or the wound being too close to the brain, because immunity must occur two weeks after the last injection.</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Doctor: What is your illness?</p>
<p>Patient: I didn't know what was wrong, so I came to ask the doctor…</p>
<p>Doctor: You can't adapt to the environment, so you have a mental illness due to psychological distortion.</p>
<p>Patient: The environment is bad, and there is no way to adapt. Shouldn't it be the environment that is distorted and mentally ill!</p>
<p>Patient: Doctors should have the heart to cut a thigh.</p>
<p>Doctor: The heart to cut a thigh is okay to say. If we really cut a thigh, how many thighs would we doctors have to be slaughtered?</p>
<p>Doctor: In my opinion, this disease is not serious.</p>
<p>Patient's Family Member: How can it not be serious? He is the family's source of income, how can he be sick?</p>
<p>Doctor: The disease you have is URI.</p>
<p>Patient: There are many strange diseases this year, but I have never heard of the disease "You are I".</p>
<p>Doctor: URI is Upper Respiratory Infection, how verbose. Haven't you heard of UNRRA, CNRRA, ABMAC? They can be called concise and smooth.</p>
<h3>The Battle Between Humans and Germs (6)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Excerpted from [Infectious Disease Management]</p>
<p>(IV) Occurrence and Cessation of Epidemics</p>
<p>There are three common situations in which the resistance of most people's bodies decreases:</p>
<p>A. Decrease in the Resistance of the General Population - This is closely related to the combination of nutritional status, age, gender, race, occupation, etc. of the population, and is especially affected by major social dynamics, such as disasters, famines, wars, etc.</p>
<p>B. Reduction of Immune Population - After all epidemics occur, the population that has recovered from the disease and survived mostly has considerable immunity to this disease. However, in addition to a few infectious diseases for which the human body has lifelong immunity, most of them gradually disappear over time. In addition, due to the natural death or emigration of the immune population, the proportion of the immune population in the group decreases, and epidemics are prone to occur.</p>
<p>C. Increase in the Population with Susceptibility - Topley and Greenwood et al. have proven through animal experiments that introducing susceptible animals into a group of animals where the epidemic has stopped can stimulate the recurrence of the epidemic. The same is true for humans: growing and moving in the existing environment, we have unknowingly contracted some minor infectious diseases that have not been detected clinically, and therefore have considerable immunity to these infectious diseases. If we move into a new environment, we mostly have no immunity to infectious diseases that we have never experienced in the past, and are extremely susceptible. Overcrowding of immigrants often leads to epidemics, for this reason. The natural birth of the population has the same effect. Newborns have no experience of contracting diseases and are mostly susceptible.</p>
<p>II. Cessation of Epidemics</p>
<p>The factors for the cessation of epidemics are opposite to those for the occurrence. A few points are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Pathogens and Sources of Infection:</p>
<p>A. Reduction of Pathogen Virulence - The virulence of some pathogens gradually decreases during the epidemic process, eventually becoming insufficient to continue to maintain its epidemic.</p>
<p>B. Reduction in the Number of Pathogens - The speed of spread of infectious diseases is closely related to the number of pathogens. When the number of pathogens is reduced to a considerable limit, the epidemic can stop. For example, the death and burial of patients, or isolation and disinfection, can greatly reduce the number of pathogens.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Transmission Routes and Methods</p>
<p>A. Reduction of Intermediaries Transmitting Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>B. Cutting off Transmission Routes - The above two points may be caused by artificial means or by natural results, all of which are sufficient to stop the epidemic.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Human Resistance</p>
<p>A. Reduction of the Population with Susceptibility - During the epidemic of infectious diseases, those who are sick die, and those who die, die. As a result, the population with immunity increases day by day, while the population with susceptibility decreases day by day, eventually leading to the cessation of the epidemic.</p>
<p>B. Improvement of the Resistance of the General Population - Or due to the implementation of public health, or due to the awareness of social consciousness, nutritional improvement, housing improvement, and the implementation of other measures to improve resistance, the epidemic is interrupted.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the occurrence of an epidemic is by no means accidental; the cessation of an epidemic is not without reason. However, the various factors of infectious diseases are complex, volatile, and uncertain. There are studies on the periodicity of epidemics and their ups and downs, which will not be discussed here. Assuming that the pathogens and sources of infection are fixed and unchanged, the changes in the transmission route and human resistance are sufficient to determine the establishment of an epidemic. The following table roughly illustrates this:</p>
<p>Transmission Route Human Resistance Disease Situation</p>
<p>Easy High Endemic</p>
<p>Difficult High Sporadic</p>
<p>Difficult Low Sporadic</p>
<p>Easy Low Epidemic</p>
<p>Easy Uncertain Endemic and</p>
<p>Epidemic alternate</p>
<p>Uncertain Low Occasionally forms an epidemic</p>
<p>Note: The words "easy", "difficult", "high", and "low" in this table are all relative and have no precise numbers to list.</p>

<h3>On Several Literary Prizes in the World</h3>
<p>— Ziyu</p>
<p>In ancient Greece and Rome, the highest honor given to poets was the laurel wreath; in the Middle Ages, men of letters were only fostered by royalty or nobles after being favored, becoming court literati; the British royal "Poet Laureate" was merely granted a country estate.  Directly giving writers money as a reward or an expression of honor, that truly only arose in the 20th century commercial capitalist society.</p>
<p>Literary prizes appearing in the contemporary literary world, such as the Swedish Nobel Prize, the French Prix Goncourt, the British Hawthornden Prize, and the American Pulitzer Prize, although they have special restrictions on the age and nationality of writers, and the subject matter of their works; they all agree in using cash as the prize.  Among them, the largest prize amount and the one with worldwide reputation is the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize was established by Swedish chemist Alfred Bernhard Nobel.  Speaking of it, this is truly an excellent irony.  Nobel was the inventor of smokeless gunpowder, a major munitions manufacturer who clumsily destroyed world civilization's construction, yet he was also the founder of the prize.  Perhaps he knew that his sins against the world were too great, so he created this prize in order to redeem this accomplished evil!  His will stipulated that his property be used to promote academic research.  The Nobel Prize consists of five categories: one is awarded for physics, one for chemistry, one for medicine, one for contributing to world peace, and one for literature.  The criteria for the literary prize are: "awarded to the writer who, in the field of literature, produces the most outstanding work with an idealistic tendency."  The prize is awarded once a year, and there is no restriction on the nationality of the winner.  The selection is determined by the Swedish Academy.  The annual prize amount depends on the amount of investment income from the foundation, but is generally between US$40,000 and US$50,000.</p>
<p>Winning the Nobel Prize for Literature can establish a writer's world reputation. However, in recent years, it is also a fact that there has been a prejudice against Soviet writers on political divergent opinions.  Also, for example, regarding Pearl S. Buck's winning the literary prize, many people generally criticize it as not being worthy enough.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize for Literature is awarded around October each year, and the time for reviewing the works is also quite long.</p>
<p>The famous French Prix Goncourt was established by the Goncourt brothers' will, using their legacy. Because the two brothers suffered from the cold reception of the Académie Française in their youth, they decided to use their private wealth to organize a Goncourt Academy, specializing in promoting new writers; at the same time, to fight against the conservative and corrupt Académie Française. The Goncourt Academy is organized by ten committee members and awards a literary prize once a year. Unlike the Académie Française, it does not require the author to automatically apply as a candidate for the prize. This easily leads to various malpractices. Their method is to select the best book from the new publications of the previous year to award.</p>
<p>Writers who have won the Prix Goncourt rarely disappoint in their future. For example, modern French writers Barbusse, Proust, Duhamel, and Malraux are all winners of the Prix Goncourt.</p>
<p>France also has the Prix Fémina, established in 1904 by two women's magazines, with a prize of 5,000 francs, awarded to the "best work of imagination in French literature each year." The winner does not necessarily have to be a female writer, but the awarding committee is entirely organized and chaired by women, which is a special feature.</p>
<p>Later on, literary prizes in France inevitably became excessive, even countless, both large and small. It is estimated that there are at least eighty types or more, such as the Football Association's football novel prize, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Society's animal novel prize, and large-scale farms' "Grape Prize" or "Fruit Prize," etc. All of this gradually lost the original meaning of literary prizes, becoming a commercialized advertising gimmick.</p>
<p>The British Hawthornden Prize is in memory of the American writer Hawthorne. Hawthorne served as the American Consul in Liverpool in 1853 and is the author of the famous work *The Scarlet Letter*. The prize is also a commemoration of him by the British literary world. The prize is restricted to British writers under the age of forty-one.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer Prize is a famous American literary prize, which is limited to American writers. The criteria for awarding the prize are: "the most complete and spirited novel published in the United States this year that can represent the American style and character." However, because of this restriction, the Pulitzer Prize Committee unexpectedly ran into a snag. In May 1926, the Pulitzer Committee announced that the winner of this year's prize was Sinclair Lewis, the author of the novel *Arrowsmith*. At that time, Sinclair's thinking was very radical, and he hated the corruption of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which chaired the prize committee. He immediately published an open letter, refusing to accept the prize. He said that his novel was not suitable for their standards, and their standards were simply not sufficient to measure the merits of a work. He called on contemporary writers to unanimously refuse to recognize their selection, saying that only in this way could the quality of American literary works be improved.</p>
<p>Sinclair's letter immediately caused a sensation among American women, and also forced the Pulitzer Prize Committee to change their criteria for awarding the prize to "giving the best novel by an American writer published in the past year, especially those related to American life." This is a very significant event in the world literary scene.</p>
<p>The situation of the world's famous literary prizes, in summary, has been described as above. Looking back at China, although there have been several prize establishments, firstly, the prize amount is pitifully small, and secondly, the selected chairpersons are simply unsuitable, inevitably having a bureaucratic style or just going through the motions. Therefore, it is not only unable to benefit the writers' lives or reputations, and unable to achieve the effect of rewarding new writers; but also simply does not arouse any interest in the literary world. Seeing the flourishing situation of foreign prize establishments, Chinese writers can only feel regret.</p>

<h3>Remembering Zhang Henshui</h3>
<p>— Tianxing</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes, Part One</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui is a famous modern novelist of the *zhanghui* (chapter-sequence) style.</p>
<p>Speaking of *zhanghui* novels, they are widespread reading material among the people. I recently heard that Ding Ling also used the *zhanghui* style to write a "Red Shoes Fairy," because it is popular and easiest for the masses to digest.</p>
<p>There are many, many people in China who love to read Zhang Henshui's novels. Because they love to read his novels, they also want to know his history. Although I don't have a deep friendship with him, I do know a thing or two about his life. Here, I will briefly introduce him!</p>
<p>This novelist is already fifty-two years old this year. I met him a few times in Nanjing fifteen years ago. He has a round face, a moderate figure, wearing a blue cloth long gown, with a mandarin jacket added on top. He is full of smiles and very amiable. When he speaks, his voice is very loud, exactly matching the ancient saying "able to startle the whole room"!</p>
<p>He is from Qianshan County, Anhui Province. Because his father was a military officer in Jiangxi, he moved to Jiangxi Province. He lost his father when he was young, and his family was very poor. In the early years of the Republic of China, he studied at the Suzhou Colonial Border School, but eventually dropped out due to poverty. He once joined a new drama troupe called "Civilized Drama" at the time, traveling to Shanghai, Hankou, and other places. In his spare time, he wrote short articles and submitted them to various newspapers, earning money to make ends meet. This kind of life lasted for almost five or six years.</p>
<p>In 1918, he joined the *Wanjiang Daily* in Wuhu as an editor. In 1920, he went north to join the *Yishi Daily*. After that, he worked as a reporter in the World and United news agencies in Beiping. In 1924, he became the editor of the *World Evening News* and began writing his debut work, *Chunming Outer History*. After this work was published, it was praised by Zhang Xueliang, who is now living in seclusion. Young men and women in the north loved to read it. But he was not famous in the south at that time. Later, Qian Jiechen introduced his *Fate in Tears and Laughter* to be published in the "Happy Forest" of the *Xinwen Daily* (at that time, that section was still called Happy Forest, not Xin Yuanlin), unexpectedly becoming famous in one fell swoop. From then on, his novels swept the country.</p>
<p>From 1935, he came to Shanghai. In addition to writing long novels for various newspapers, he also edited the "Huaguoshan" supplement of the *Li Bao*. In 1936, he went to Nanjing and started his own *Nanjing Renbao*. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Chongqing and served as the chief writer for the *Xinmin Daily*. Last year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to Beiping and has been in charge of the editorial affairs of the Beiping edition of the *Xinmin Daily*. He still writes for major newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>He writes very diligently. He has now published more than fifty long novels, and there are still six or seven unfinished novels in various newspapers. It is said that he does not choose the time or place for writing. Even if he has a minor illness, he can rush to write on the bed. When many friends sit and talk with him, he can still write non-stop. This kind of spirit is something that ordinary people cannot do.</p>
<p>His literary cultivation is entirely due to his "self-study university." He has also put in a lot of hard work in English. According to a friend, when he was working in a newspaper in Beiping, he still had to recite English after finishing his night shift. Later, the person in charge heard about it and said that everyone else needed to sleep and could not do this, so he stopped.</p>
<p>He also has a very deep love for art. He and his brother Muyu once ran the North China Academy of Fine Arts in Beiping. He can write landscapes and flowers, but only close friends can see them.</p>
<p>He likes to smoke cigarettes, does not drink alcohol, usually likes to sing a few Peking Opera lines, and even more likes to invite a few friends to taste tea and chat. His mother is still alive, and she is over seventy years old. He is very filial to her. He does not eat anything that his mother has not eaten.</p>
<p>Recently, he has used the pen names "Old Swallow" or "Poet of Doggerel" to write many poems and lyrics, and he has also published two volumes of essays, "Mountain Window" and "Travel," which are equally fresh and fluent, making people fond of them.</p>
<h3>Boatman</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>When the moon rises at the beginning of the month, a thin layer of silver light is sprinkled on the lake, so the lake at night is transparent.</p>
<p>The young boatman gently rows the oars, gently, the boat quietly glides across the water. The wind is so subtle, I watch the shimmering waves on the ripples, everything is asleep on the tranquil lake, only the rhythmic oars gently tapping the lake water, that low sound like a dream.</p>
<p>Is this a boat carrying dreams?</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, the boatman's face is a pale color. At his young age, he should be the tender grass receiving sunlight and dew; but for the sake of life, for the sake of two meager meals of wheat bran, he has sold his childhood to this lonely oar, rowing, rowing, forever, in the moonlight, in the sunlight, when the wind blows, when the rain falls, always rowing like this...</p>
<p>Silent, not saying a word, not singing a song, time quietly slips away from the sound of the oars. He is already too tired of this quiet lake, and no longer has the leisurely mood to appreciate the scenery on the lake; look at his tired eyes, already sinking into that distant dream.</p>
<p>He should be dreaming of the stars! Or is he dreaming of the seaweed? Perhaps he doesn't even have this bit of leisure, because tomorrow's reality is difficult! Tomorrow's stomach will still be hungry...</p>
<p>In his tired eyes, I may be relatively happy, am I really happy? The traveler's dream is also equally desolate, like a withered flower, also having endured much wind and rain. Although able to rest for a day, the journey is enough long!</p>
<p>Tell me, is this a boat carrying dreams? If so, young boatman, row me home!</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 59</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Tong County is a pest to Hebei. If it is not eradicated, it will be like a poisonous cancer. Once it develops, the consequences will be endless. Recently, I learned that some members of your department are already active in that area. I believe that the puppet army and puppet security team in that county should be the targets of activity: among these two groups, there are no lack of heroic men who are also waiting for an opportunity to act; most of these people are from Changbai Mountain. Although they are rough in nature, they are quite clear about righteousness. The unfortunate thing is that most of your department's personnel are strong men from the south, and their lines are different from theirs. Not only is it difficult to cooperate, but there may be even more misunderstandings between the two parties; this is why I introduced Ms. Yaoqun to Hu Cheng... Although Xiao Hucheng is only a child, the forty or so large and small fortresses in the north do not know of Little Tiger's existence... If these two people can be ordered to go to Tong County to be responsible for liaison, they will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort..."</p>
<p>Mr. W read to this point, looking very pleased, looked at me and nodded, saying, "Brother, you now understand the importance of these two people, right?" Saying this, he immediately frowned, sighed, and said, "I didn't expect them to have completed the great task of liaison, but before the big event could succeed, they suddenly disappeared. It's really frustrating... However, I think they are definitely not in danger, maybe..."</p>
<p>The telegraph operator in the room, at this time, hurried over and handed a piece of intelligence that he had just received to Mr. W. Mr. W couldn't bother to speak, and immediately focused his attention on the intelligence.</p>
<p>"Brother Yue, look, this is the third report," saying this, he faintly smiled and handed the telegram to me.</p>
<p>"Ping 16, Tong, progress has reached the point of success, the entire 12th Regiment of the Ji-Cha Autonomous Army, and the entire security brigade of 1,500 men, revolted at the same time. From 6:20 PM to 10:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet armies, spies, and special agents were all resolved. Currently, Shao Sixteen and Security Brigade leaders Zhang Yantian, Zhang Qingyu, Xue Jue, and 12th Regiment leader Du Junfei, etc., are leading their subordinates to fight against the Japanese army in the suburbs. The rebel leader and his party cadres, etc., have been almost completely eliminated, and the puppet government office has also been burned down. Comrades Ji and Xiao have not been heard from as of the time of dispatch. 28, Special, Ping, 16, etc."</p>
<p>The time had reached 11:15 PM. I packed the necessary items, and Mr. W introduced me to two fellow comrades. I shook hands with Mr. W to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Our car still passed through the front gate of Zhengyangmen, through the martial law sentry post, and set off towards Tong County along the railway highway. Upon reaching Erdaokou, hundreds of yards away from our position, under enemy fire, we diverged onto a side road, making a large curve to the north. After exiting the enemy's firing range, in a remote place, I affixed a prepared vehicle pass to the car's dustproof glass, and followed the small road, turning southeast, towards the Ping-Tong highway. At this time, the further we advanced, the denser the Japanese checkpoints and sentries became, because we had already entered their cordon. For convenience, I had already taken out my home-spun skill, transforming into a proper Japanese special agent character. Further on, in less than an hour, we had safely arrived in the northern suburbs of Tong County, but the cannon fire and gunfire outside the southern suburbs was still fiercely bombarding. Less than a mile from the city, we passed through the last layer of Japanese blockade and reached a layer of "no man's land", and then removed the car's pass. In this chaotic situation, only people like us have this kind of freedom in action.</p>
<p>Because we had not yet seen our temporary sentry post, we dared not rush forward, and had to reduce our speed to the lowest. It wasn't until less than a mile from the north gate of Tongcheng that we discovered that the main road into the city had been bombed and cut off, and the car could no longer proceed. Just as we were about to get out of the car to explore, we suddenly heard a gunshot, BANG, with a hissing sound, a bullet flew over our heads, and at the same time, we heard someone shout "Password!"</p>

<h3>Mrs. Cripps' Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Mrs. Cripps has arrived in our capital. We welcome this friend of China, not only wishing her a pleasant journey, but also hoping that what she sees and hears during her travels in China will allow her to have contact with the honesty, sincerity, peace, and friendship that we Chinese possess.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cripps is the president of the British Aid to China Fund. In the past, she gave us a lot of help, but what we Chinese are grateful to her for is not so much the amount of aid in pounds sterling, but rather the meaning of this movement she leads, a movement that has promoted the noblest human compassion and further consolidated the moral foundation of human society.</p>
<p>If human beings could all treat each other with love, help each other in times of difficulty, and support each other in sickness, would the world today be so turbulent, with so much fraud and strife? Would there be so much killing and slaughter filling the fields and cities?</p>
<p>Before Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to China and return to England, Mrs. Cripps' knowledge and understanding of China could be said to be no more than that of an ordinary Briton. However, after understanding it more deeply, her enthusiasm in running around and appealing throughout Britain in recent years has moved us to tears. She became our friend, and due to her, we have gained many more British friends. This harvest is far above those aid funds.</p>
<p>The British character has always been deep and it is not easy to make friends, but they never make promises lightly and are faithful. Once they make friends, they can be good friends for life. This is quite in line with the traditional moral values of us Chinese, good friends and "I would rather wrong myself than wrong others." Therefore, we dare to believe that Mrs. Cripps will always love us and will always be our good friend.</p>
<p>It is truly an honor for our National Day capital to have this distinguished guest from overseas.</p>

<h3>I am [Ipso-Phone]</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhu Ping from Life (Sept. 2, 1946), page 50</p>
<p>"I am Ipso-Phone. This is XX Company. Mr. So-and-so is not here. What would you like to say to me? Please prepare—now—please speak."</p>
<p>Have you ever felt watched by your telephone? Are you afraid that this black thing will start ringing when you step out of the office for a moment of leisure? Do you want to slip out and play ball for a while—intending to let it ring incessantly—but are also a little hesitant? Don't worry, here's something new to tell you that can solve those problems. When you are out and someone calls you, your phone will emit a soft voice to answer for you: "I am Ipso-Phone. This is such-and-such company. Mr. So-and-so is not here. What would you like to say to me? Please prepare—now—please speak."</p>
<p>The advertisement says: "Ipso-Phone can receive and send phone calls for you." Indeed, the objective that many communications experts have studied for nearly fifty years has finally been achieved with the invention of Ipso-Phone. Before you go out, just connect it to the phone line. When you come back, you can pick up the phone receiver and turn on the button on the Ipso-Phone. If someone has called, it will tell you exactly what they said.</p>
<p>Principle</p>
<p>The basic principle of Ipso-Phone is quite simple, including an ordinary telephone and a steel wire recorder for recording speech. If you are out and someone calls, after the bell rings four times, Ipso-Phone will automatically emit the above recording: "I am Ipso-Phone...etc." (You can choose other phrases yourself.) Then it waits to record the other party's speech. If you are so shocked by this novel thing that you are speechless, it will wait for you for half an hour, or even until you speak. But after you finish speaking, don't forget to report your own name, and then hang up the phone. At the same time, it can wait for someone to call a second time.</p>
<p>During World War II, Oerlikon, a company famous for manufacturing aircraft cannons, located in a region of Switzerland, obtained the patent right of Ipso-Phone from a German named Moller; and entrusted the company's design department director—a brilliant young physicist and firearm expert—Keller, to improve it so that it could be used in the market. There are currently eighty Ipso-Phones in public use within Switzerland. Other countries may have this machine available in the market in the short term.</p>
<p>Wonderful</p>
<p>The exquisite construction of the Ipso-Phone is enough to make Swiss watchmakers sigh with admiration, because its wonderful use is not limited to the one mentioned above. If you are playing ball outside and are afraid that someone will call you, you may wish to use a nearby phone to call back, and you can hear everything that Ipso-Phone has recorded for you.</p>
<p>That's not the most amazing thing. The most amazing thing is that it can also keep your secrets. Otherwise, wouldn't anyone be able to dial your phone number and eavesdrop on your Ipso-Phone's recording? On the surface, Ipso-Phone is just an ordinary telephone, installed in a larger metal box. There are four rows (five in each row) of buttons and ten symbols on the box, with numbers from 1 to 0 printed on two rows of buttons. Before you go out, first insert the key into the lock hole next to the box, rotate it a quarter turn to the lower right, and then browse through the buttons printed with numbers, and press a few at random. For example, press the numbers three, five, and seven. Then take out the key, and the pressed buttons will automatically return to their original position. In this way, it seems to have become your password—three, five, seven.</p>
<p>Calling</p>
<p>When you call back from outside, when Ipso-Phone says "[ ]", you must loudly shout: "Hello! Hello!". In this way, Ipso-Phone will no longer continue to say: "Now—please speak." It will say a series of numbers, from one to zero, with a two-second interval between each word. At this time, you must firmly remember your password—three, five, seven. When it says three, you must shout like just now: "Hello! Hello!", and the same when it says five and seven. As long as you haven't made a mistake in the password numbers, it will definitely tell you all the calls it has recorded.</p>
<p>If you forget the password you have created and want to guess randomly, it will politely emit an ignoring sound. Don't you think this is an excellent way to keep secrets? Because there are as many as one thousand and twenty-three ways to arrange these ten numbers. It would take anyone eight hours to try all these methods one by one. At the same time, you can change your password at any time. It can truly be said to be as safe as Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Perhaps after listening to Ipso-Phone's report, you want to cancel the recording. This is not a difficult task either. Just when it has finished broadcasting the recording and emits a buzzing sound, you can follow it by saying: "Erase! Erase!". The recording will then disappear, without a trace.</p>
<p>If you want to record something yourself, you can call out "Hello! Hello!" after it has finished sending the recording and emits the first buzzing sound, and then say what you want to say, and it will record it for you without missing a word.</p>
<p>Are you planning to go on a business trip to another city? For example, you currently live in New York and want to go to Chicago to negotiate an important deal. At the same time, your partner needs to go to New Orleans for business. You need to know that hotels are fully booked is commonplace nowadays, so neither of you is sure that you can find a room in that designated hotel.</p>
<p>Password</p>
<p>Before leaving, you can jointly agree on a password. Then, feel free to lock the door and go your separate ways, guaranteed that you will have no problems. After you arrive in Chicago, you can live wherever you can, of course, we won't ask you to live outdoors, and the business negotiation the next day will also go smoothly. But how do you notify your partner? Don't worry, it's very simple. You can make a long-distance call to the New York office nearby and let Ipso-Phone record where you are now and how the negotiations are going. When your partner calls back, they can use the password you jointly agreed upon to hear your recording.</p>
<p>If you are surprised by hearing Ipso-Phone for the first time and forget to speak, it will repeat the opening speech after waiting for twelve seconds. Even if you forget what you wanted to say and need to look it up in your diary, these twelve seconds are more than enough.</p>
<p>So far, there is no way to manufacture an integrated telephone recorder. What is currently used is divided into two parts: one part is a rectangular metal box (about the size of two typewriter desktops), and the other part is an ordinary telephone. The metal box can be placed anywhere in the office, and the box is equipped with all the recording equipment.</p>
<p>Rental</p>
<p>In Switzerland, Ipso-Phone is rented and not sold. The lease term is five years, with a monthly rent of 150 Swiss francs (approximately US$35). In the short term, it may be difficult for Ipso-Phone to appear in the United States. Because it is not something that can be used just by installing the components, it is necessary to promote it widely in advance so that the general public has a considerable understanding of this novel and strange thing, so as not to be at a loss when hearing Ipso-Phone's opening speech.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the U.S. government is very cold towards the Oerlikon company because it sold munitions to Germany during the war. Oerlikon's host, Mr. Shawley, is Switzerland's richest arms manufacturer—formerly a German citizen. He racked his brains to try to sue the U.S. government to recover a factory rent of 30 million to 50 million U.S. dollars, which was the amount the U.S. military borrowed his arms factory to manufacture munitions. At the same time, because the origin of Ipso-Phone is unknown, I am afraid that Pla will also find it difficult to secure his patent rights. According to Oerlikon's claim, they obtained it from the German Moller.</p>
<p>The U.S. occupying forces in Germany are now investigating this matter. If Pla's legal basis is insufficient, then U.S. citizens will be free to manufacture it. Needless to say, there is no question that Mr. Pla will be barred from the door.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: "Ipso-phone" was originally named Ipso-phone)</p>

<p>Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, secretly signed up to take the county magistrate examination in order to organize local county administration. Surprisingly, he was among the top candidates. The chief examiner initially thought it was someone with the same name and did not recognize him as Chairman Huang's father. He was appointed as the acting magistrate of Guiping County. However, many people thought he was using his son's influence to become a county magistrate. He frankly said, "At home, we are father and son; in office, we are superiors and subordinates. This is called handling public affairs impartially." It is said that this Mr. Huang Sr. would occasionally go to the provincial government to report to his son, but the son was embarrassed to meet his father and had to send the secretary-general to meet him on his behalf. Later, after much persuasion from relatives and friends, Mr. Huang Sr. submitted his resignation. This matter not only serves as a warning to officials but also sets an example of not using private connections!</p>
<p>Two "spider news" items have recently been discovered: one in the north and one in Hong Kong. The former has a large round ball growing on its back, bulging up like a human head, complete with eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth. The latter can recognize English letters, and its intelligence is almost on par with that of humans. Do you think it's amazing or not? The spider is like the appearance of humans and no less than the inner world of human beings. Can it almost be called the human being among insects? If you allow me to quote a cliché, then you might as well call it: Can you be a human being and not be as good as a spider?</p>
<p>Since the "Pickpocketing Brigade" entered the "Fanzi," the pests in this city have been reduced a lot. According to those familiar with the pickpocketing life, this single pickpocket always likes to hold a newspaper in his hand, using the opportunity of pretending to read the newspaper to shift your attention. Furthermore, he uses the newspaper itself and the posture of reading the newspaper to conceal his pickpocketing actions.</p>
<p>From this point of view, today's newspapers have more new wonderful uses: First, they have become the treasures of pickpockets' "magic tricks"; second, they have become good tools for hiding stolen goods.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Shijie, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs, is one of those who entered the political arena as a pure scholar. He is a news figure in the post-victory peace negotiations.</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, Wang was a strong member of the New Culture Movement, often publishing writings and opinions in magazines such as New Youth and New Tide, and was as famous as Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, and Luo Jialun.</p>
<p>Wang is a native of Chongyang, Hubei, with the courtesy name Xue Ting, and is currently fifty-six years old. After graduating from Tianjin Beiyang University, he went to study in the United Kingdom in the third year of the Republic of China. In the sixth year, he obtained a Bachelor of Political Economy from the University of London, and then transferred to the University of Paris in France. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he obtained a Doctorate in Law. After returning to China, he served as a professor of constitutional law and head of the law department at Peking University. At this time, North China was governed by the Beijing government. Wang used his spare time from teaching to found "Modern Review," severely criticizing the corrupt politics of the time. The publication was subsequently sealed, and Wang had no choice but to go south to seek another way out.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he first served as the Director of the Bureau of Legislation of the National Government, which was the beginning of Wang's entry into officialdom. In the seventeenth year, the International Court of Justice in The Hague heard of Wang's fame and specially appointed him as a judge. In the eighteenth year, he returned to China and served as the president of Wuhan University. In the twenty-second year, he served as the Minister of Education, a position he held for as long as six years. In the twenty-sixth year, he served as the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee until last year, when he was transferred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Wang is a legal expert and has authored many books, including "Comparative Constitutional Law," "The Chinese Slave System," and "A Brief Discussion on the Shanghai Concession." The book "Comparative Constitutional Law" has greatly increased his worth.</p>
<p>Since taking office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang has moved from a domestic politician to an international figure. The "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship," the "Sino-French Treaty of Equality," and the "Five Foreign Ministers Conference" were all signed by Wang with a brush produced in Anhui.</p>
<p>Regarding the conclusion of treaties and attendance at meetings, many Chinese people have criticized and misunderstood Wang. Regarding this level, I am unwilling to add subjective criticism, but we should know that if China wants to strive for international status, all the people must unite and rise up in unison, so that we can exchange for the respect of other countries. It is impossible to succeed relying solely on a diplomatic representative to negotiate, no matter how eloquent he may be. What's more, there is a government above the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Wang has a happy and harmonious family. His wife is Ms. Xiao Dehua, and they have two sons and two daughters. The two daughters—Xuehua and Qiuhua—have both graduated from National Central University, and both are technical talents, one studying medicine and one studying engineering.</p>
<p>Some people say that Wang Shijie's appearance is very similar to that of Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen. However, Wang is much more serious than Wu Guozhen. He does not have Wu Guozhen's demeanor of talking and laughing. News reporters are more welcome by Wu Guozhen.</p>
