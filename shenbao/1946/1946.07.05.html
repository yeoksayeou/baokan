<h3 id="c1">馬使將於日內飛平　國共繼續直接談判　經兩次會商已稍獲進步 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國共直接商談，今日中午十二時起，在普陀路八號陳誠公館正式舉行。到邵力子、王世杰、周恩來、董必武，先進餐後開始會談，首由政府代表將昨日國防最高委員會決定十一月十二日召開國民大會一事，吿知中共代表，當時中共代表曾表示國大之延期，乃係政協會議之決定，今茲定期舉行，亦應經政協會議通過。嗣據邵力子表示，昨日國防最高委員會議決，定期召開國民大會一事，乃因因民參政會不能延期過久，故決定召開國民大會，此可顯示政府忠實履行政協決議，實行憲政之決心，至於政協之重開，爲期亦近，一俟目前各項問題商談，獲致協議後，即可召集。又關於今日會談之成果，據邵氏稱：余等直接商談今日爲第二次，其待決之問題，即爲馬歇爾過去個別商談時所遺留之困難而不易解決諸問題，自不能於今茲一兩次直接會談中即刻獲有結果；至今日雙方交換之意見。尙待會後雙方自行考慮商討後，再爲會談商決，預計今晚及明晨尙不及　續舉行會談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕據關心國共直接商談之某權威人士談：國共兩次會談已稍獲進步，五人會談如能於明日下午　續舉行，屆時可能獲得一部份協議，其最先解決之地區，可能爲蘇北或哈爾濱，因前者中共曾自承爲尙未做好之新「解放區」，後者聞杜聿明與林彪即將會面，並聞蔣主席對蘇北現狀極表關懷，對蘇北流亡在外之三百餘萬難民之苦况，軫念尤殷。又聞共車如能自動退出蘇北，人民將節食買絲以繡周恩來像。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕據中共發言人稱：國共談判無甚進展。又悉：蔣主席今日曾召集各重要部長，商談有關國民磊會事宜，歷兩小時。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕聞今日中午國共代表二次直接會談，其討論之中心問題，仍爲共軍佔領區撤軍後之行政問題，其會談內容，雙方曾鄭重約定互不發表。但據消息靈通者言：今日雙方曾廣泛談及哈爾濱、膠東、皖北、蘇北各地共軍撤退後，當地行政組織，塈由政府派往維持治安之保安隊問題，惟未作任何決定。現中共雖堅持己見，但因其所提之保留行政權要求，不啻非武裝佔領，不僅無充分理由，且以缺乏法律根據，形同草寇式之政治割據，一旦共軍撤退後，立成無政府狀態，中共如不事先安排地下組織，則凡此中共佔領區內之所謂行政權，中共能否憑其少數共軍即能如意控制，雖中共本身恐亦不敢自信。因此比較中立之明智人士，咸望中共不必作此冒險嘗試，徒苦人民，乾脆從哈爾濱、膠東、皖北、蘇北各地撤退，共方開誠與政府商討中共佔領區　軍後，保留中共黨務活動問題，及如何收回抗幣問題，則尙不失一旣成政黨之黨務。</p>

<h3 id="c31">討論　但願政局從此開郎 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>國防最高委員會前大決議，國民大會定於本年十一月十二日　國父誕辰召開，並確認政協決議案繼續有效。這是中國政局半年來陰霾重重中透露的一綫光明，但願從此豁然開朗，不再爲濃雲暴雨所籠罩。</p>
<p>中國政局從表面看，似乎很複雜，其實簡單之至。只要現在的國民政府，眞能努力向着「政治民主化」和「軍隊國家化」這條大道邁進，一切難題均可迎刃而解。「軍隊國家化」這個題目，事實上要牽涉到共軍的統編，也許要比較費些脣舌商討；至於「政治民主化，」則是否兌現，全看政府之決心如何，實在沒有其他理由可以作爲推託延宕的藉口。</p>
<p>召集國民大會，制定憲法，是政治民主化的必由途徑。國民黨歷年來的一貫主張是如此，國父孫中山先生規定由訓政而憲政的程序更是如此；而且遠在抗戰以前早有充分準備，並且頒布了五五憲草。我們最不可解的，何以勝利十個月了，政府還是一再展期？以前，因爲日寇侵略，全面抗戰，國民大會延期，猶可說也；但國民黨旣决議去年十一月十二日召開，其時抗戰又已勝利，理應如期兌現，而何以政府遷就共黨，竟再展期？此本爲國民黨執政期間分內應爲之事，何其自信心缺乏一致於此！然退一步猶可說是爲了要爭取和平，不得不與各黨派共同協商，此種苦心，容可爲國人所共諒。但國民大會旣經政治協商會決定於本年五月五日召開，並規定（一）第一届國民大會之職權爲制定憲法，（二）增加黨派及社會賢達代表，那末，老百姓望穿秋水的國民大會，總該如期召集的了。詎知政府又突然於會期前十天下令，宣吿五月五日的國民大會延期召集，而且沒有規定延展的日期，這不啻向一般熱望民主憲政的人民，當頭澆了一盆冷水！在政府當時的想法，大槪因爲共產黨拒不提出國大代表名單，故不能不再行展期，留有繼續商談的餘地。殊不知共黨的本意並不要解决問題，而只在拖時間，故雖延期，而所爭執的問題却仍未解決。大公報批評共黨「事事皆過程，一切無結論，」實在道着了他們的心事。老實講，國民政府，現在只要自動自發的交付政權於國民，走向民主憲政的大道，有誰能阻止它？何况老百姓久已要求召開，政府也早己有諾言在先，豈容少數黨派從中作梗，妨碍憲政的早日實現，民主的早日成功？</p>
<p>本報一日社論，早就說過，共黨的阻撓破壞是一回事，而政府表示「天下爲公」之誠意是又一回事。現在政府又決定十一月十二日召開國民大會了，這是政府自動走向民主憲政的表示，也是國民黨增强自信的象徵。我們希望，當局要看得淸，把得穩，萬不可舉棋不定。政府此次决定了日期，如果爲了少數政客的意見所影響，漠視人民的期望，將來再失一次大信，則「民無信不立」，以後恐也不能有什麼方法再使人民來相信政府了。</p>
<p>政府旣已大澈大悟，决心要還政於民，這眞是中國政局趨於光明的朕兆。我們深望共產黨和其他黨派，趕緊推出代表來，參加國大，萬萬不能拖到十一月國民大會召開的前後，再來橫生枝節、使國大開不成功會。</p>
<p>據昨日南京電訊，共產黨與民主同盟對此事的反響，尙不一致。共產黨表示政府决定召開國大日期，在事前未有所聞，在國民政府未改組以前，國防最高委員會之决定，中共不受任何約束。而在所謂「民主同盟」方面，則竟謂「政府未經會商而决定國大會期，有背政協會議的精神」。即此可知共產黨與「民盟」對於政府的苦心，似乎還沒有完全了解。政府之所以召開國民大會，在政府是表示它要實行政協決議的萬分誠意，是表示它實施憲政的决心。各黨各派倘存心鬧別　則已，否則如果也有同樣的誠意與决心，就該開出代表名單來，準備參加大會，共同制憲，那纔有功於中國的民主運動。我們要敬吿各黨各派的賢達：國民大會本來是國民代表的大會，國民代表己經等候了十年，不能再讓任何一方面推託延宕的了。政府現在旣順從民意尊重民意而定期召開，國民代表也準備如期出席，那時諸公被推爲黨派代表與否，出席共議與否，實在不干我們國民的事。我們老百姓祇指望我們所選舉的代表，能够在本年國父誕辰集會於首都，誠心誠意制定國家的根本大法。這是中國政局開朗的惟一希望！</p>

<h3 id="c60">路局大舞弊案中一封信　「女律師」爲夫洗刷　郁香嚴不愧爲「賢內助」　表示病愈即可投案免被誣吿事實俱在當局正嚴密跴緝中 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕這次路局一萬萬餘元大舞弊案中，最受人注意的一點是：據說這次舞弊案的主角是一個女人——材料處處長張鴻圖的妻子郁香嚴。</p>
<p>前天晚上，本報突然接到了一封離奇的信，信封上寫着「北四川路永　坊五十三號嚴緘」，兩　信牋上寫滿了匆忙潦草的鋼筆字跡，原來竟就是這位處長太太寫的！</p>
<p>下面，是那封信的原文：</p>
<p>「申報主筆先生鈞鑒，閱報得悉路局大舞弊案另指嚴（記者按郁香嚴自稱）爲處長之妻　逃，舞弊總數逾一億元　情。你想嚴係一弱女子，鴻圖爲公務員，數十年奉公守法，爲歷任長官與同僚所共知，不知說話，只知做事之一專門技術人才，請主筆先生維持正義，培養只知做事之專門人才，採訪確實材料，以明眞相。外子鴻圖旣不參加，嚴更無參加之理。又該事報吿陳局長者，爲外子張鴻圖，係在農歷五月初，向陳局長請求將全處重要人事調整，初步着手將張伯康更調，請局長即日派人，局長答無人，外子鴻圖說如局長實在沒有，材料處要鴻圖負責，我保薦材料司老同人　　（原文）當將履歷送上，請局長爭取時間，最後決定。彼答今日有事無暇，况該事太大，容考慮後答復。翌日即下令張伯康停止辦公。自即日起，一切由材料處處長秉承候副局長辦理。主筆先生，外子鴻圖是密商及密吿局長，此事均有簽呈可查，如何事過許久，反說到我的頭上了。總之不做壞事不怕，世上明眼人極多，以及一切，均有道理。况數月以來，我在滬時極少，眞相是有明白一天。嚴候病稍愈，立即投案，請求依法查明眞相，免被誣吿。嚴因病字不成體，語無倫次，請諒，此請公安」</p>
<p>本報記者馬上趕到了信封上寫着的地址。老實說，去的時候本來就想大槪未必會找到這個人，但是，却沒有想到那裏竟早就警探密佈，戒備森嚴！原來這的確是張鴻圖的住宅，他們正在等候着有沒有從犯來。</p>
<p>路局裏，承辦本案警備處處長王兆槐氏一看到那個郁香嚴寫的那個信封，詳細研究了一下，吿訴記者說：「的確是郁香嚴的親筆！」</p>
<p>王處長說，「郁香嚴即使不能說是主犯，但是旣和本案主犯張鴻圖是夫婦關係，當然是正犯之一。信中所謂簽呈揭發舞弊，好像推得很乾净，但郁香嚴旣然居心無他，何以又　不見面？本處當然有事實根據，然後才檢舉他們」！</p>
<p>郁香嚴是一個受過相當敎育，思想也相當周密的人。她是嘉善人，今年四十多歲，抗戰開始，曾跟張鴻圖到重慶。勝利之前二年，她又獨自回到了上海，掛牌做僞律師。她爲人非常幹練，據說那位張處長竟是處處唯　命是聽的，這次費盡心機弄來的兩千四百萬元，現在也還在他這位「賢內助」手裏。</p>
<p>何以說郁香嚴思想周密呢？她是有烟癮的，而在不久以前戒烟的時候即化了個假名叫趙文采。她是在六月二十日到林森路四明里偉光醫院去戒烟的，那時候，路局已經得到舞弊的密報了，張鴻圖曾去找過她。她一連在醫院裏住到了六月二十五日，明明烟癮還沒有戒絕，却又突然出院了——就在這一天，舞弊案給路局陳局長翻了出來！</p>
<p>然而，郁香嚴還是沒有銷聲匿跡——在六月二十八那天，她還到過陝西路五百六十九弄六十四號朱勞聖醫師處檢查了一次身體，據說，這位朱醫師是她的親戚。從那一天之後，郁香嚴就失踪了，唯一的綫索就是給本報的一封信。</p>
<p>這次舞弊案的全部贓款是一億二千一百七十萬元，路局在案發時　得三千萬，後來陳局長限期四十八小時由各關係人將款子全部交出，到昨天爲止，又收到二千六百多萬，正確的數字目前還在核計——不過，郁香嚴的身邊却還是帶着張鴻圖名下「分到」的二千四百萬的。全部有關人犯十七名，已經由路局送到地檢處，但地檢處却仍舊請路局密切合作，繼續緝捕，其中最主要的一個目標也就是這位郁香嚴！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「七七」紀念籌備　員會，昨晨在社會局召開會議，決定抗戰殉難軍民追悼會暨忠烈士公祭事宜，均定七日上午九時在天蟾舞台舉行。關於慰勞烈士家族及傷病將士辦法，決議如下：（一）慰勞方式側車精神慰勞，具體辦法由慰勞組決定之。（二）慰勞對象以蒙難同志會及軍之友社有案可　者之烈士家族及傷病官兵爲範圍，美英法蘇盟軍亦在慰勞之列。（三）關於誌哀事宜，決定當日全市下半旗，停止娛樂宴會，正午放警報長聲，全市人民即須各就本位立正一分鐘。又全市基督徒並定七日舉行和平祈禱大會</p>
<p>「又訊」記者於昨日下午三時細雨霏霏中登巡洋艦「洛杉磯」號參觀，海關美軍碼頭之渡輪每半小時一次，登艦後由士兵領導參觀。該艦有砲位十餘尊，最大口徑八吋，艦首載水上飛機兩架，船尾鐵錨粗大如臂，艦頂並有雷達裝置，艙房設備均甚齊全，閱讀室四壁圖書林立，十餘士兵，正埋首於文字中。廚房鍋鑪巨大，新出籠之麵包香味四溢，服裝室中且有我國成衣匠四五人忙於縫　。詢諸彼輩待遇，據云除供膳外，月薪七十元美金，尙有「外快」，狀頗滿意。記者巡視全艦一週，所見担任勤務之士兵均仍專心於工作，固不因佳節當前而有所鬆懈也。</p>

<p>自從勝利以後，汽油身價一落千丈。當我們看到遍佈市區的汽車加油站上每加侖七百四十元的價目時，回想起抗戰期間「一滴汽油一滴血」的辛酸口號，眞有「白雲蒼狗」之感。在汽油價格這樣便宜的今日，無疑的洗車階級正步入了他們的黃金時代。舒適，快捷，威風，且又便宜，汽車眞可以說全是十十美的代步工具。</p>
<p>不過「不如意事常八九」，汽油的價格便宜了，汽車的供給却並不能有求必應。如果你僅僅是一個「暴發戶，」你也許會因爲買不到一輛一九四六年的福特而傷腦筋，或者你在「非買不可」的決心之下終於達到了目的，那末你一定也已化去了可觀的代價。</p>
<p>最大的原因在於目前美國汽車製造廠裏的出品數量還有限，因此在出口與分配方面就有了很嚴格的限制。美國規模較大的汽車製造廠有克雷斯勒，通用，福特三家，他何現在對於國外經售商採用分期供貨的辦法，把一年分成四期，在華較大的經售商每期大槪供給一百五十輛，較小的衹有五十輛左右。</p>
<p>遠在戰爭剛結束的時候，許多「目光遠大」的主顧就紛紛定貨，當時定價普通的都不到美金三千元，所付定洋不過七百元至一千元而已。現在車子到了，因爲求過於供，產生了非常驚人的黑市。這種黑市價格，也像房屋一樣用金條計算。例如克雷斯勒的定價每輛美金二千九百五十元，黑市賣到二十一條，順風牌的定價二千三百五十元，黑市賣到十五條，派克定價二千九百五十元，黑市要賣到二十五條。經售商爲維持信用仍照原來定價售與最先定貨的主顧，而這些獲得新車的「倖運兒」，有許多却就在黑市中轉售出去，他們所獲的巨利，如果衡諸循規蹈距的工作酬報，也許辛勞一生還不能獲得此數呢。</p>
<p>目前已經抵滬的新車不過幾十輛而已，不久聽說有一批福特可到，另有一種地蘇土，月內可在市上出現，還有一種意大利出品的飛愛脫牌子，也已在裝船啓程。如果上海碼頭的擁擠情形可以改善，八月以後，當有大批可到。盼望最新式享受的「有福的」人們，你們耐心地等着吧！（飛鴻）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲菲律賓獨立紀念日，上午十時半，菲僑二百除，在蒲石路敎堂舉行感恩禮拜，由美神父麥克格萊，立浦門，及菲列浦斯等主持，至十一時半始散。菲僑各執小旗，冒雨登卡車，沿途大呼「麥布哈」，意即「菲律賓萬歲」。</p>
<p>下午四時，假國際飯店二樓舉行慶祝會，到吳市長夫婦，美總領事台維斯夫婦，吉倫中將，美副總領事崔華德，美軍駐華副司令路加斯上校，外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉夫婦，財政局長谷春帆，工務局副局長王繩善，及菲僑等約二百五十人。升旗儀式開始，奏樂後，由菲律賓獨立紀念委員會副主席維拉宣讀菲總統羅哈斯來電，略稱：「今日余願祝賀上海菲同胞，並深信汝等能明瞭一自由國家公民之責任，此外對美國慷慨賜予吾等之自由，應予感謝。」繼即由台維斯夫人雙手捧菲國旗一面，由四菲律賓女士陪同至樂台，將旗授與代表，奏樂升旗。維拉氏敘述菲國旗歷史謂：此旗乃麥其倫氏於一五二一年創立，以前各酋各旗並不統一，此旗之白色乃表示純潔與和平，藍色示愛國熱忱，紅色示勇敢，三角示平等，三星代表呂宋，明大奴及維撒稚斯三島，八道光芒代表八省。</p>
<p>樂隊奏菲國歌後，即由獨立紀念會主席羅白哥致詞略稱：四百餘年前，菲律賓爲西班牙所統治，一八九九年六月二十三日，美國戰勝西班牙接管菲律賓，四十餘年來，從未發生流血事件，美國以友誼態度對待菲人，至今使吾等以獨立自由，吾人衷心感激，並將繼續光烈，負起責任。羅氏詞畢，在塲菲人又高呼「麥布哈」不已。</p>
<p>奏畢美國國歌後，台維斯氏起立表示菲律賓與美國數十年來不僅互相戰勝疫疾，並在經濟，政治，社會上共同合作，而今菲島獨立，以後仍希望維持密切聯繫，並代表美國慶賀全滬菲人健康及幸福。</p>
<p>繼奏中國國歌後，吳市長因要公遲到，先由陳國廉氏發表祝辭，後吳市長暨夫人趕到，即致詞略謂：菲律賓獨立可爲其他國家之榜樣。中菲兩國爲隣國，在血統上有密切關係，美國尤爲中國盟友，以後三國當更趨合作之途，茲代表本市人民敬祝菲國友人前途光明。</p>
<p>最後由菲僑十餘人表演土風舞，極爲精采，菲女均穿彩色禮服，鮮豔奪目。此外尙有跳舞餘興。</p>

<p>絲價最低時期　民廿三廿四年絲　到最低價，（民廿四年土種　僅十一二元一擔，改良種亦衹十七八元一擔，絲價20/22到過三百元關口，）農民育蠶興趣，逐漸減少，雖經政府竭力提倡，改良製種，培育秋蠶，檢騐品質，推銷外洋，然產最終難　增加，迨八一三以後，農民鑒於外銷之阻塞，糧食之步漲，遂將蠶桑搗伐，改種糧食，年復一年，至去年止，僅產五六千擔，大有不堪回首之慨。</p>
<p>美國絲價低落　勝利以後，中蠶公司，抱絕大努力，領導絲商，本年春雨時期，因日本存絲大量傾銷，美國生絲市塲，遂由每磅十一元之市價，降至每磅九元，恐尚有續降可能，我國方面，因外匯膠滯，售價不高，不利出口，而農民育蠶成本高昂，又不能以賤價售繭，（農民不售繭，可於　土絲或自烘乾繭見之）絲廠商處此地位，惟有繞室徬徨而已，故繭賤則害農，繭貴則病商，政府既不願廠商以賤價採購，使農民虧耗，而中蠶公司又以鼓勵農民育蠶興趣，亦不願以低價收辦，使農民感覺失望，一面督促廠商，須以相當價格收入，一面以低利貸款，給予廠商，以資補苴，法良意美，實可欽佩，至現下止，各處結束，已大致就緒。</p>
<p>本年之繭產額　計本年，江浙二省貸款廠商，共收土種鮮繭市秤三四，五〇〇擔，改良鮮繭市秤一一六，〇〇〇擔，約可繅絲一萬餘擔，尚有合作社繭八，〇〇〇擔，廠商未貸款者，約四，〇〇〇擔，可繅絲一千餘擔，計總產量約一萬一千擔，較去年增加一倍，較民十六最高峯，僅十分之一。</p>
<p>售價不够繭本　收繭完畢，廠商困難開始，查照本年成本，改種鮮繭約需十四萬元一擔，（市秤）加　支每擔六萬元，計需廿萬元一擔，假令以鮮繭市秤十三擔，繅成廠絲一擔，即需繭本二百六十萬元，外加繅工每擔一百三十萬元，（工一百五十萬除下腳廿萬）已在四百萬左右，所有借款利息，墊款利息，保險棧租種種，尚不在內，　顧國外，僅售九元一磅，每擔絲以一百三十三磅計，僅合美金一千一百九十七元，以二千元匯價折合，每擔絲僅值二百三十九萬四千元，（按以上之價，係美國交貨，尚須除去費用每擔十餘萬，）現在以繭本售絲價，尚需虧折四十萬元一擔，繅工則完全無着。</p>
<p>繅工昂貴原因　至繅工需費如是之鉅，一由工資龐大，二爲燃料高昂，三爲運輸不暢，以前每一擔絲繭本九百元，繅工衹四五十元，（浙江繭有不貼繅工，繭本即絲本者，）衹合百分之五，現在繭本二百六十萬，繅工一百三十萬，合百分之五十，繅工已加十倍，而工人管理尤較前困難，工人取得商工資後，又絕對不肯服從管理，故廠商之困難，實達焦點。</p>
<p>農困愈於商艱　總之，本年繭收情形，核計起來，農民每擔繭售十五萬元，尚可購米三擔，以視民廿四年之繭價，每擔售十七八元，而米價亦需八九元一擔，衹有兩擔米可購者，差勝一籌，而絲業之危機，則爲空前未有，繭子收畢，已屬筋疲力竭，再無餘力可以開工繅絲，長此停頓，商工交受其敝，農民目睹情況，將不敢復爲育蠶之舉，故此種危險情形，已臨極點，如不積極補救，則商人破產，工人失業，農人絕望。</p>
<p>惟一救急辦法　惟有　請政府先行借給繅工，俾便早日繅製成絲，一面由中蠶公司考核各廠成本，定一中心價格，由政府予以收購，並給商民以應得之微利，如是，則廠商垂絕之生機，可以挽救，此後廠商對於政府之力圖報稱，自亦有其應盡之職責，政府方面，對此號稱第一種之出口事業，維持不敝，轉而易取外匯，於國家亦有相當補助，此後農民樂於育蠶，商人樂於經營，則工人生計自可維持，福國利民實利賴之。</p>

<p>— 趙曾玨</p>
<p>廻顧與前瞻　（續）</p>
<p>供電方面</p>
<p>據四月份統計，全市發電量爲五千三百四十二萬度，售電量爲五千零七十二萬度，平均每一市民，用電約十四度強，比諸去年十月份之售電總量一千三百十五萬度，平均每人用電衹四度者，已經增加二倍有半。上海電力公司（目前滬市電　除法商發電一小部份外，全賴該公司供應）二月份的最高負荷，爲十一萬一千六百瓩，已超過該公司現有機力。（現有發電機總量爲十二萬三千瓩，除留一機作備用外，實際衹十萬三千瓩）此後的負荷，預計本年八月可達十三萬瓩，十月可達十四萬八千瓩，明年一月可達十六萬四千瓩。</p>
<p>本局爲解決困難起見，早就設法補救，照目前可能增加的機量約略估計，閘北水電公司壞機的修復，大約八月間可以發電五千瓩，永安第四紗廠舊有發電機一具已飭其修整使用，七月間即可發電，總量爲四千瓩，除自用二千瓩外，餘二千瓩，可供給市民應用；上海電力公司有一具一萬五千瓩之高壓蒸汽機，預計十月間可以修復；其戰時受損之十六號渦輪機一具，發電量爲二萬二千五百瓩，早已運美修理，約本年底可以修復運回，江南電力局新購之二萬五千瓩浮電機一具，現正洽購，如購就亦可於本年底運到發電，再加法商電　電燈公司之現有柴油發電機量一萬三千五百瓩及上海電力公司之現有機量十萬三千瓩，本年年底時，全滬可共有發電機容量十七萬六千瓩。又上海電力公司曾向美國新訂二萬五千瓩發電機一具，約明年夏季中可以運到，則明年本市發電機總量可達二十萬一千瓩，全市用電，亦大致可以應付了。</p>
<p>在增加機量未能實現以前本局爲防止無限制接電以致供求不能相應影響整個市民起見特組織一　供電審查委員會，限制接電，這是一種緊急處置的權宜辦法。</p>
<p>至治本計劃全市應當成立一個完整的健全的電氣網，此電氣網大致以楊樹浦的上海電力公司爲一個發電廠，閘北水電公司爲一個發電廠，江南電力局在龍華成立一個發電廠，浦東方面亦在適當地點建立一個發電廠輸電電壓照經濟部規定應一律爲三萬三千伏，配電電壓應6600伏綫端電壓應爲380及220伏這國個發電廠的綫路，也應相互接通成爲一個完整的上海都市電力供應網（Power　Gird）彼此密切聯繫，各公司雖相互獨立，實際亦無異一個整個的大機構了。</p>
<p>陸上交通</p>
<p>目前上海市民最感痛苦的一件事，莫如車輛擁擠交通阻塞。我們要明瞭其據結所在，而加以適當的糾正，請先看下面一張簡單的統計表。</p>
<p>戰前車輛與戰後車輛數與質的比較：</p>
<p>時期　汽車　卡車　公共汽車　電車　人力車　腳踏車　三輪車</p>
<p>戰前　七、二九八　三、六六九　二七六　四五二　一八、四五二　一二二、〇四八　——</p>
<p>戰後　六、六六八　四、三九四　五六　三九一　二五、〇〇〇　九〇、〇〇〇　一一、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（其中二一四四輛軍用）　（其中二四三九輛軍用）</p>
<p>照上面統計所示，戰前公共運輸的車輛，如公共汽車減少了二百二十輛，軍車減少了六一輛，小汽車減少了四三〇輛，卡車增加了七二五輛，人力車增加了六·五四七輛，三輪車增加了一一·〇〇〇輛。換言之，個人低速的車輛增加很多，集體高速的車輛反大大減少，實際的運輸量大量減低，交通情形反較戰前擁擠。擁擠的最大原因，還在車輛速度的不一律。速度不同的車輛種類一多，疏通便不容易。戰前速率不同的主要車輛，衹有機動車和人力車，現在又加了一種三輪車，其速率介在機動車和人力車之間，而且數量不少。這種情形是世界上任何其他各都市所沒有的。</p>
<p>目前我們救治這一缺憾的辦法：</p>
<p>第一增加公共交通的車輛，此事本局已在接收敵人車輛中設法修復公共汽車四十餘輛，開關一路二路三路臨時公共汽車。最近又向行政院物資供應局購到T-234車五十輛，正在打造車身，準備開關四五六路臨時公共汽車。法商的二十二路，現已增加到二十六輛，其二十一路亦已責令購置新車二十輛，恢復行駛。英商電車公司，尚有無軌電車七十輛，亦經責令購置車胎，從事修理，最近將來亦可恢復行駛。據本局確實的統計，在本年一月份各項公共交通工具，每日載客總數爲五十九萬七千一百八十六人，本年六月增至每日八十五萬五千四百七十七人，計每日增加二十四萬八千二百九十一人，較諸一月份每日乘車人數，增加百分之四十強。</p>
<p>第二訂立管理臨時長途客車營業辦法，暫准領有執照之汽車行或運輸行以營業運貨汽車加裝客座作臨時長途營業客車。（未完）</p>

<p>（四）青年軍之復員：青年軍及其他各部隊（憲兵，輜汽團，汽車技術訓練班）之從軍學生，除駐日佔領部隊及其他任務重大之部隊，延緩復員外，其餘統限於本年五月底完成，預備軍官教育經結業考試，成績及格者，授予陸軍兵科少尉，預備軍官不及格者，則授予預備軍士，業已按照各項規定，已一律辦理完畢。</p>

<p>最後說到吾人今後努力的途徑亦即是如何去建立與健全新制度，就誠所知，當從下列四點力求自勉互勉。</p>
<p>（一）舊觀念的打破，大凡一個舊機構的改組，從舊的轉向新的，從落後的轉向進步的，總不免有一種舊觀念，舊積習所形成的反動力量，以爲阻碍，古今中外，多少良法美意，得不到順利的推行與良好的結果，無非都是這種舊觀念從中作祟的緣故。就我國目前情形言之，所謂舊觀念，其最顯著者約有下列三種：（一）拘泥現實，不求進步，有這種觀念的人，總是畏難茍安，認爲多一事不如少一事，他們雖不致作積極的反對，但消極的阻碍與冷淡的態度，無形中的影響，也是很大的。（二）注重表面，不顧實際，具有這種觀念的人，其主要着眼在於如何保持地位與如何敷衍公文，至於實際上究竟解決過多少問題，與實際問題是否解決，則非其本意，如果要和具有這種觀念的人商談改制變法，自然更非其所樂聞了。（三）感情用事，不問是非，這種觀念，在我國今日的社會上，也是非常的普遍，他們對於興革的事情，本身原無主見，但對於興革的人，却成見甚深，同一應與應革的事情，只要主持的人不是出於他們的贊成，他們即不惜從中破壞，使之無法進行，這種觀念，實在最要不得，對人事小，誤國事大，如不澈底革除，國家就永遠不會有進步。</p>
<p>（二）現有困難的克服，任何良法美意，當進行之初，都是不會沒有困難的，尤其中國今日的環境，情形特別複雜，其有賴於我全國各級官兵同志，共同克服之處，自然也特別之多。如（一）反動份子有計劃的破壞，想大家都能看得清楚，反動份子陰謀，即在破壞政府的威信，離間政府與人民的感情，倘如他們深知主席求治心切，即不惜到處製造變亂，使之無法施治，他們深知國軍如果建設成功，一切便可步上軌道，即不惜到處發動軍事衝突，意圖阻撓，我們目前所遭遇的困難，尚無逾於此。（二）自身無意識的阻碍，除了反動份子，有計劃的破壞外，而自己本身，亦不免有許多無意識的阻碍，譬如怠者不能修，忌者畏人修，與衹求一事一時之方便等心理，往往都是出於不自覺的，而其結果，亦足以使興革大業，遭受不少無理的阻碍。（三）環境上各種條件的不够，這種困難，可以說是無法避免的，因爲中國本是一個落後的國家，生產不足，科學落後，而今日世界潮流之所趨，又不能不勉力適應迎頭趕上，所以不得不拿「人一能之已百之人十能之已千之」的精神來應付，這種地方，告人一方面固須互相諒解，而一方面，尤須互相策勉。</p>
<p>（三）新制度的建立，打破舊觀念，克服新困難，其目的即在於建立新制度，新制度的基本精神有二：（一）要有法治的精神，新制的建立，首在培養法治精神，這一點，主席亦曾一再剴切訓示過。所謂法治，簡言之，就是遵照法規來辦事，破除情面，一秉大公，而其要養有二：（子）分層負責，（丑）層層節制，如此則權責既可明確劃分，業務亦可分配得宜。（二）要有科學的方法，所謂科學方法，質言之，即是分工與合作，因爲業務門類至繁，一人所知有限，故不可不分工，以便各盡所能，但分工決不是將工作作機械的劃分，仍須保持密切的聯繫，庶各個部門，不致形成孤立，失去整個靈活的運用，所以分工與合作，必須相互爲用，不可偏廢。</p>
<p>（四）新使命的達成，上述各點，既經明瞭之後，吾人還須進一步研究如何才能打破舊的觀念，克服現有的困難與建立新的制度，誠以爲要達成這一使命，必須具備下列三個條件：（一）有認識與決心，這亦是擇善固執的意思，對於反動力量與各種困難，也有明確認識，即須立定決心，去加以打破與克服。（二）有勇氣與恒心，有面對現實的勇氣，並持之以恒心，夙夜匪懈，不達目的不止，（三）有毅力與信心，俗語說：「天下無難事，只怕有心人」。又說：「有志者事竟成」，只要大家皆能有毅力與堅定不移的信念，事無鉅細，終必有成功的一日。</p>
<p>現在新制度業已創立，規範粗具尚待充實，此後應如何改進健全，以確立三百年不拔的基礎，其有賴於我全國各級袍澤，共同努力之處正多，值此奉命就職之日，即是臨深履薄之時，整軍建軍，責無旁貸，羣策羣力，還希共勉。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c123">你疰夏嗎？ <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 伊凡</p>
<p>所謂疰夏，並不是一種疾病，而是夏令生活失調後發生的一個綜合現象，那就是胃口體重精神一般的減退。所以雖然不是疾病，也就憑空大大削弱了身體內的自然抵抗力和積存的本綫。因此疾病容易侵襲，有了病時比平時更加經受不起。夏天一般人胃口不好，普通有四種理由：第一就是天熱本身；第二是由怕熱而減少戶外活動和體力勞動，因此而影響胃口；第三則因天熱出汗，以致體內缺乏　份，因缺　而損失胃口，第四種理由，是體內一種維生素的缺乏，飲食減少，就減少了乙一種維生素的攝入量，乙一種維生素的缺乏，嚴重在可以致脚氣病（即賴脚病），輕微的繳候則有胃口減退精神萎頹等等。</p>
<p>普通都把「疰夏」看做無可避免的健康缺陷。到了夏天，本人先　氣：「糟了，糟了又是夏天，我又要消瘦沒有精神了！是年年疰夏的。」家裏的人則格外小心的提醒他：「你是一向疰夏的。夏天又來了，多休息休息，東西吃得淸潔些罷。」結果疰夏的還是疰夏。</p>
<p>其實，只要對準上而所說夏季一般人胃口不好的幾種理由而解决，就是解决「疰夏」的法子。一，天熱沒法子，只好還是讓它熱去。二，戶外活動和體力勞動仍舊應該繼續，（農忙的農夫不怕疰夏），汗儘管讓它痛快的流好了。三，體內缺乏的鹽份水份應該補足·大戰中北非的美軍每人每餐都服一片鹽片，就爲是此。不一定要鹽片，每餐把小半茶匙鹽當補藥服下去就好。四，體內缺之的乙一種雜生素也該補足，多吃豆類和花生，吃糙米，不要吃碾得過分精細的白米，吃精猪肉，（據營養學家在北平做的調查，城市人食物中，猪肉是乙一種維生素的重要來源）。夏天多吃油膩固然敗胃，但是「六月素」是吃不得的。若是吃得起情猪肉，我勸你還是吃吃罷。</p>
<p>你的孩子如果已經開始疰夏，不要心疼他，嬌養他，把他達到球塲上去出一身臭汗，再拋到水裏去游泳個痛快，再把又　又富於乙一種維生素的食物餵他吃一個飽，才許他休息，你看他還敢不敢疰夏！</p>

<p>— 陳悅書</p>
<p>夏季已臨，可畏之諸傳染病亦隨之而來，對衛生稍不經意，即有罹疾之虞，喪財害命，危險曷甚，今謹與讀者一檢討個人應如何注意夏令衛生。</p>
<p>虎疫一症，爲夏季流行病，顧名思義，其兇惡可知，雖在現代設備完美之醫院，仍不免相當高死亡率，蓋該症侵襲兇猛，病重者甚或數小時內死亡，救治頗不易也。預防方法如飲食店之檢查，市民飲水來源之有效消毒，病人之隔離及病人糞便嘔吐物之適當處置等項，皆爲衛生當局之責任，茲不贅述。個人應注意者有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）「病由口入」此諺用於虎疫，至爲確切『蓋虎疫之弧菌係直接或間接汚染食品飲料，而後得進人人體，引起疾病。倘個人對飲食特別注意，食品飲料皆經煮沸或可靠消毒後入口，則該症實無由發生。街頭巷尾所販之冷飲陳食，已削皮殼之瓜果，傳遞於攤販不潔手中，皆爲傳染媒介，愼勿貪一時口福，自貽伊戚。（二）奮　來往於　便食品間，實為可怕之散　使者，飯應食堂中，尤應多方驅除消滅之，蠅己釘食之食品應再度消毒或捨棄之。防　可用紗面紗罩等，減　可用提　缸，捕蛹紙　拍，最近發明新藥DDT有遺跡減　之偉效，宜其溶劑　或刷於房間壁上，並與他法相輔而行。（三）應注射虎疫防疫針，免疫性可持久四五月，故應每年注射，不可因去年已注射，今年即霍免也。（四）有虎疫嫌疑者，即應迅速通知衛生當局，以便隔離消毒，不可因揗延誤，害己害人。</p>
<p>傷寒及副傷寒亦爲夏季常見之症，病者臥床呻吟一二月之久，不幸者更可併發腸出血，腸　破，腹膜炎，贍襄炎諸險症而致喪命。該症之傳染及預防方法如飲食衛生，防　及打防疫針諸項，皆與虎疫相似。近年來醫家有主張防疫針改用皮內注射法者，據云該法較以往之皮下注射法更爲有效，且引起之反應較微。</p>
<p>痢疾及夏季腹瀉皆爲夏季流行惡症，於嬰孩，老年及體弱者，尤易致命。其預防方法亦與虎疫相似。帶菌者（即病已痊癒而糞中仍帶細菌之人）之存在，爲該症流行之一重要原因，近年來歐美醫家試用磺胺胍及琥珀醯磺胺噻唑於治療帶菌者，結果甚佳，將來或可有助於阻止該症之流行。又有試用該藥於預防者，似亦有效。</p>
<p>夏季蚊蟲繁死殖，瘧疾自屬常見，間日瘧及三日瘧雖不一定致人於死，然使病者體力大虧因而引起他症。至於惡性瘧，則常極兇驗。防　之方，首　付蚊　，方法可分消極與積極，消極者如利用紗窗蚊帳以防蚊接近人體，塡　無用池沼，除去盛水器皿以免蚊幼蟲發育等法，積極者如用油類巴黎綠殺蚊幼蟲，以除蚊菊DDT殺蚊等法。美國衛生及軍事當局會以飛機散佈DDT於蚊蟲繁殖之處以預防瘧疾、結果圓滿。用藥物預防，至今尚無理想之藥劑，在第二次世界大戰中，英美軍隊曾廣用阿的平（每日〇·一公分，每週服藥六日）結果尚屬圓滿。普通入民倘有需要，亦不妨試用，惟此方並非治本，且服者皮膚變黃，頗不美觀也。</p>
<p>脊隨灰白質炎亦爲暑期疾病，患者多孩童，其後果常爲肢體某部瘓攤。國人對此症尚不熱知，故羅斯福總統之不良於行，即此症後果，該症之傳染方法，尚未確知，除鼻腔一途外，腸胃道近年亦被認爲重要病原侵入途徑。爲父母者當任意以下數項：</p>
<p>（一）當該症流行期聞，小兒有發熱，頭疼，頸背强直，肌肉疼痛等症象者，應速請醫師診斷治療並使其臥床休息至少一週。（二）注意飲食及減　，因蒼　亦為該症可能媒介。（三）應禁止兒童游泳於可能被糞便汚染之河池中。（四）該症流行期間，非急需之小手術如扁桃腺割除術等皆應避免，因手術常能引起該症並增加其嚴重性。</p>

<h3 id="c126">防治民族病：肺癆 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 楊郁生</p>
<p>抗戰旣勝，建設爲先，講到眞正建設，還是從民衆的健康上做起！健字從人從建拚成，則建設人材，是以健康爲要着。</p>
<p>此次世界戰爭，中國勝利了，然三等的體格，不能胃充頭等的國民，必須講求社會衛生，檢討民族的他康。中國民族健康上最大的問題之一，是防治肺癆，經此戰劫之後，生活困苦，營養不良，一般靑年以及各階層的民衆，患肺結核—即肺癆，幾爲各醫院及各醫師所最常見之病患，殊堪憂念。</p>
<p>肺結核自古認爲不治之病，當時醫學未進步，視肺結核患者，大多數皆難治，醫藥鮮效而歸於死亡；或倖能生存，亦不能服勞社會種種工作，形同廢人。然肺結核實非絕症，自醫學進步之後，如能早期診斷，亦不難治愈，據各專家詳細之考證，在中國社會衛生向不注意，人人有接觸傳染之機會，其已感染此病，不知不覺間有一小部分自然治愈，更有一部分病機進行，以致於不治者不乏其例。肺結核的死亡率爲百病之第一位，對於國家民族的投害更大，而我國民智未開，有病濫投醫，徒耗光陰和金錢，並延誤其療養之時機，很爲歎惜，爲社會衛生方面，特將防治要點分述如次：</p>
<p>（甲）肺癆的早期診斷在一九二五年以前，各國肺病專家，以爲肺結核之早期診斷，應注意肺尖部，以爲病變之進行，由上而下，殊不知肺門部之傳染亦甚多。肺癆越早治療，越易奏效。</p>
<p>（乙）肺癆的治療</p>
<p>（一）靜養　凡住居城市　鬧之區，應遷移至郊外或鄕村，進絕人事之繁，如病屬嚴重，更應嚴格靜養，並嚴守醫師之指示。每見患病之靑年，不肯恬靜休養，而急躁好動，以致病勢轉深不救者甚多，不勝悼惜。</p>
<p>（二）營養　人體生活一天，即不能一天不飲食，以供新陳代謝而維持生命，然飲食必須注重營養，肺癆患者每因營養不良，妨礙病體復原。兒童營養不良，每致發育阻滯，亦易慛染癆病（結核病），至營養方面，注重蛋白質，脂肪，各種維生素之充分供給外，更應注意其易於消化，以補給人體之活力。</p>
<p>（三）樂觀　患病決不能樂觀，然樂觀正可使病勢减輕，每見肺病患者，鬱鬱不樂，開始整夜失眠，胃納大减，則不久即骨瘦如柴，精血消竭，雖有良醫，亦告束手。懊態與恐懼，無補於病，反有加速病機之進行。倘能悟徹人生，齊生死之觀，不怕病，而有勇氣和決心療養，與結核菌相周旋，並抱有信念，深信肺癆非絕症，爲可治之病，不限時日，常以愉快之心理療養，則我人之身體細胞的活動與精神狀態，亦大爲活躍，體力亦增强，病亦易漸漸治愈。</p>
<p>（丙）肺癆的預防</p>
<p>（一）注重衛生，保持個人的健康。早起，早睡，每日須有八小時安眠。</p>
<p>（二）常在郊外散步，不做太勞劇運動。</p>
<p>（三）工作有定時，勞逸得其平均。</p>
<p>（四）每日飲食有定時，有定量，不遜飽不忍　，食品注重營養。</p>
<p>（五）床位宜高燥，應各人獨居一室。陽光應求充足，空氣應求流通。</p>
<p>（六）每年應請尊師施行健康檢騐。</p>
<p>（七）病者飲食所用碗，筷，不皿等，用開水煮沸，並嚴格實行分貪制</p>
<p>（八）室內肩痰盂，不許隨地涕吐。病人咳嗽，以手帕掩住口鼻。</p>
<p>（九）肺癆病人以離開家庭，隔別療養爲宜。</p>
<p>（十）勿到擁擠的塲所去。</p>
<h3 id="c127">孕婦常識 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 唐淑之</p>
<p>婦女在妊娠初期，即需注意衛生。食物方面，須營養豐富，含足量之蛋白質，每日最好飲牛奶一磅，鷄蛋一二枚，肉類三四兩，稍進維生素甲·乙·丙·丁·以補食物之不足。五個月後，宜加鈣片，以助胎兒，骨骼之生長，且可防孕婦　齒與骨質軟化病及嬰兒軟骨病。身體方面須保持淸潔，因皮膚除其他功用外，尚有排泄作用。故每日最好洗浴一次，冬天至少每星期兩次。八個月後，則不宜坐浴，因汚水易從陰道入內，可致產褥熱。睡眠方面須充足，午後最好休息一二小時。精神須愉快與安靜。衣服方面，宜柔軟寬適，使胎兒發育不受阻礙。大小便須暢通，惟忌服劇烈瀉劑。在產前一個月，禁忌房事，以防產褥熱等弊。</p>
<p>自懷孕第一月始，每月應至產科醫師處檢查一次。七個月後，每兩星期一次。產前檢查包括（一）測定產婦骨盤之大小。（二）診查胎兒位置及其他狀况。（三）檢查孕婦全身有無疾病，最好每一孕婦，能經X光透視肺部。如發現有肺病或心臟病重者，可在妊娠早期用人工流產。輕者在妊娠期，可予以特別保養之指導。（四）檢查血液，血壓，及小便等。孕婦血中如查出有梅毒，胎見常於妊娠後期死於腹中。故每一產婦懷孕初期就醫時，須檢查血液。倘發現有梅毒，應予以適當治療。遇有血壓或小便不正常時，亦須及早處置。因妊娠毒血症（Toxaemia　of　Pregnancy）主要症象爲高血壓，蛋白尿，與水腫，如不及早治療，孕婦及胎兒之生命均有危險。總之產前檢查之主要目的：在保障孕婦及胎兒健康，並减低臨產時之危險。</p>
<p>在生產時，須送正式醫院生產。決不能由產婆收生，因此輩產婆，旣不諳習解剖生理，對於消毒知識，更完全缺乏，使之收生，萬分危險。</p>
<p>產後四星期至六星期間，應至醫生處檢查，視產道傷處與子宮復原否等等。因產後最易有子宮後傾，子宮頸被裂或發炎等症。倘有上述諸症，須即治療，免日後發生不孕等症。</p>
<p>附帶稍述關於哺乳之當識。嬰兒最完善之食物，莫若母乳，因其營養豐富，濃度適宜，易於消化。且母乳中，含有數種免疫體，可使嬰兒對於數種傳染病之抵抗力增强。哺乳應有定時，最好每四小時一次。三個月後，夜間可停止哺乳。常見普通家庭，或因長輩溺愛，或出於無知，每當孩兒啼哭，便喂以奶。結果乳腺因過度疲勞，無相當之休息，致奶水稀少，因而嬰兒營養大受影響。嬰兒哺乳期，至多不宜超過一年，嬰兒八個月至十個月後，可逐漸代以牛奶，鷄蛋·麥片·餅乾·菓汁等物，以應嬰兒身體之需要。</p>
<p>母親卯萬不獲已時，不宣僱用乳娘，因彼等之乳，多係過時（產後一年以上者）。且若　缺乏　育嬰兒之知識，影響嬰孩前途甚大。</p>
<p>懷孕有時並不在子宮內者。所謂「宮外孕」是。最常見者，爲輸卵管受孕。其主因係受精之卵停留而生長於輸卵管中，普通六星期至八星期後，輸卵管破裂致內出血。出血過多危及生命。</p>
<h3 id="c128">上海的梅毒及其代價 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 董賓機</p>
<p>梅毒是一種使人上當的慢性傳染病，這種病在初發時，往往很溫和，病人祗感到一點點痛苦，有時甚至沒有痛苦，因此病人往往不加注意，失去早期治愈的機會，以後病入深處，雖即醫治，而功效甚少了，加以一般對於梅毒治療不很明瞭，以爲梅毒一病，幾針即可了事，多打砒針反認爲無需，以致患者之受合理治法不足十分之一，於是增加隱伏性與晚期病例，　　傳染，爲害殊深，此種情形皆爲梅毒病率增加的主要因素，</p>
<p>上海市民的梅毒病率，雖暫時不能有一準確數字，但可由各方搜集，約略作爲參考：一，難民—根據一九四〇年上海國際紅十字會第</p>
<p>一難民醫院住院病人報吿：血淸康氏反應（梅毒）陽性者佔……百分之三一·二二·中等階級（有能力自費或低費住院者）——由上海紅十字會第一醫院住院病人自一九四五年一月至六月間一般檢騐結果統計而得：</p>
<p>血淸康氏反應陽性者……百分一五·〇新生嬰孩臍帶血淸康氏反應陽性者……百分之四·〇</p>
<p>三，妓女—根據本市衛生局性病防治所本年五月底娼妓檢騐報吿：血淸康民反應陽性者……百分之六·二舞女侍女（經該所勸吿而受檢者）康氏反應陽性者……百分之四〇左右四，全市市民中梅毒病率（以上作參考）估計至少在……百分之一〇左右依現在人口計算，全市梅毒患者估計至少當在三十萬人左右其次依據現代公認的合理醫治梅毒方法，將時間和余錢的消耗檢討一下：甲，早期梅毒（初期及二期）乙晚期梅毒，其治療不能一槪而論，所需時間與金錢較早期者多一倍至三四倍，因破壞已深，不能挽救者甚多，</p>
<p>最後讓我們估計上海梅毒病人的醫療人力和物力：假定每位醫生和一位護士每星期能當心六百個病人，那末，倘使要立刻醫治全市三十萬病人，我們要動員至少五百位醫生和五百位護士，以每位病人耗費二十五萬元計算，共需至少七百五十萬萬元。</p>
<p>諸位，請想一想：如此浩大費用；如此大批人員；在如此社會經濟環境之下，應該有怎樣的一種感想？</p>
<p>現代醫學已漸漸而進入預防方面，這是應有的現象，同時梅毒絕對可以防止的疾病，只要個人講究衛生，自己抑制性慾，這是大家都知道的，那末，上海的市民甚至全國的國民是不是再應該讓這種病魔繼續爲害下去？我以爲這是們大家應負的責任，理應立刻開始和菌　爭！</p>

<p>— 顧毓琦</p>
<p>時値夏令，疫癘叢生，任何人皆應有衛生常識，藉可避免疫癘，以保健康。爲使吾人注意預防，茲將衛生常識，擇其要而易行者分列於後：</p>
<p>（一）飲食須愼：病從口入，古訓昭然，所以食品必須新鮮，飲料必須煮沸，杯碗食具，最好每次煮沸消毒，凡一切生冷不潔之食物及腐爛之水菓，切開多時之西瓜等切忌服食，瓜菓之類，宜用消毒藥水或火酒洗滌之後，再去皮食之，庶可避免陽胃傳染病。</p>
<p>（二）早期注射防疫針：爲預防傷寒，霍亂等病之傳染，最好及早注防疫針，並須每星期注射一次，連續注射三次。</p>
<p>（三）居處淸潔：夏季氣候炎熱，蚊蚋　虫，隨處飛集，最易爲各種傳染病之媒介，是以里弄庭院，均應隨時用水冲洗，廚房尤須注意，如有積水之處，宜速以泥沙塡平，並用DDT等殺虫藥水噴酒，庶可免病菌之傳播。</p>

<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>諸民館以信保全總理藏腑與遺善為理由，要求覆察，雖然已獲准許，但其最後命運如何，仍在未定之天；而冠生園主人忽亦呈文蘇州喬等法院，證明褚曾營救該公司重要職員多人。有利證據固不嫌其多，不過以情理揣度，恐怕營救幾位糖莫公司職員，未必就能減輕罪名。或謂這是一個好兆，因為該公司一切出品的商標，不是一個「生」字麼？這就可以說是暗示褚民誼已有一綫「生」機。</p>
<p>家裏來電話告急，據說華總路華盛路　　定過米店多家，却買不到一粒米，真的到了「巧婦難為無米之炊」的境地。我沒有辦法，惟有請問當局，市府每天已有幾千担米配給各米店，為何還是買不到，而且買不到米的不僅吾一家。那末配給的米又從那裏去了呢？</p>
<p>白水手傷　　水手案中，有美商船船長等證人七名，被法院扣留在滬，計凡七天，其在滬之一切調食費用，概由吾政府負擔；於是地方法院便支付了廿五萬六千餘元。此案為不平等條約取銷後吾大中華民國法院受理的第一件外人犯罪案，而法院負擔證人的生活費用，似乎亦屬鮮見。</p>

<p>黃金美鈔昨日小跌，許多做做的朋友，免不了都哭喪着臉，雖然好不自在，但想到扶搖直上之日，甜迷迷仍在心頭。翻雲覆雨，投機行當就是要跟斗，老做手是山人自有道理的。</p>
<p>造字的人（有人考據並非倉頡，）當初的確煞費苦心。以「跌」字而言，為「失」「足」所拼合。</p>
<p>失足為跌，假使跌下來立刻爬起，至多破層皮流點血，如果一跌便跌斷腿，那真是一失足似成千古恨了。</p>
<p>奇怪的事，米不但不跌，反而無處可買。一個同事三日未回家，昨天太太打電話到報館裏向她的先生告急，說家裏顆粒無存，跑了三家米店，還是空手而回，怎麼辦？同事回答說：怎麼辦，祇有買麪吃。</p>
<p>不是有八千擔米交給各米店配售的嗎？而且規定每人可以買一斗的嗎？</p>
<p>等到這位同事和別人談起這事時，一位老門檻的朋友告訴他，你呌你的太太走進米店時，就聲明願意出七萬元一擔，包可以買到米。</p>
<p>然而，表面上米價是四萬五千元一擔，生活指數統計中也是四萬五千元一擔米，然而實際上沒有方法買到米。</p>
<p>米到哪里去了？</p>
<p>中央銀行源源拋售黃金，金價才跌；如果源源供給白米，如果沒有奸商藏匿，米價才跌。單是硬要它跌，不會跌的。</p>
<h3 id="c132">人間的悲劇 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 庭譯</p>
<p>——真實的故事，真實的愛情。</p>
<p>這是一齣人間的悲劇。偉大的愛情寫給我們一個生離死聚的斷腸故事。這故事係洛山基新聞報編輯查克，福斯泰根據真實的報告寫成而登載於他的報紙上的。這一齣悲劇是這樣展開的：</p>
<p>這是差不多午夜了！丹伐爾地方發行的洛山基新聞報本埠編輯羅維爾舉起電話筒，打到一個新聞記者，桑頓，那邊去，說：「喂！這裏有一宗精采的汽車失事案。開車的傢伙已經死掉了。快些把這宗事情調查一下。寫下來給最後一版。」</p>
<p>桑頓接到電話之後，便回答：「我知道這件事情了。死者名字呌做興頓，三十歲，建築師。他的汽車在晚上撞進唐寗街八號一所學校的圍墻裏。速度每小時七十英里。唔！他於十一時三十一分便與世長辭了。這件事的原委便是這樣。」</p>
<p>說完之後，他立刻跑到檢屍所去視察一番，在那個死屍的身旁找出一個滿佈灰塵的信封，上面寫着「建築師興頓」。回來根據這名字去翻人名錄，把死者的經歷每一個要點都寫下來：「耶魯大學畢業生。在巴黎研究建築術。丹伐爾地方有幾個最華麗的房屋是由他經手建築的。青年交際界裏的佼佼者。已婚。」</p>
<p>桑頓繼續把人名錄所着附的新聞斷片仔細地看下去，尤其是關於他的結婚生活方面。那斷片裏寫着他度過蜜月歸來的情景。他的妻子是一個美麗的攝影模特兒，名字呌唐納。</p>
<p>那張報紙的交際欄編輯這樣記錄着：「興頓夫人本人比照片還要可愛。她告訴我，他倆在蜜月旅行的時候一同居住在克里斯托夫島上一個小小的市鎮，呌做聖布帝諾。他倆住在築在山頂上的一所攝影室，望下來便是一個滿佈着棕樹的山谷。興頓夫人說：這是一個多麼美麗的蜜月旅行啊！」</p>
<p>桑頓把那些新聞斷片立即插入那信封裏。這確是扣動人們心弦的材料呢。但這個故事還未完結。他繼續閱讀其他新聞斷片，一段一段地記載着他倆的社交生活，宴會，以及興頓事業的成就。最後看到他倆於兩年後仳離的故事：興頓夫人後來以精神上的虐待與遺棄的原因控告她的丈夫。她宣稱，興頓日夕致力於其事業，連和她消遣一個晚上的社交生活的時間都沒有。</p>
<p>桑頓於是草率地把那平凡的死亡報告寫了出來，然後將草稿扔到編輯的檯上。</p>
<p>羅維爾把像獵犬一樣銳利的眼睛看了一下，便問：「興頓是什麼時候死的呀？」</p>
<p>桑頓把草稿略為翻了一下，說：「他是十一時三十一分死掉的」。</p>
<p>羅維爾又問：「興頓駛車的速度為什麼這樣快呢？他到底駛到什麼地方去呀？桑頓，你的報告還是不完備的。他的妻子到底怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>桑頓答：「他們已經離婚了呀！」</p>
<p>「那末，他已經離了婚的妻子呢？把她找來，問問她對於這事件有什麼感想。她或者會流淚，或者會悲泣。也許她會告訴你一些悲楚動人的故事亦未可知。總而言之，這樣的補筆將使你的故事成為十全十美的了。」</p>
<p>桑頓聽了，帶着不愉快的情緒尋找唐納私寓的電話號碼，然後搖過去。數分鐘之後，對方拖着無精打采的聲音回答：「先生，唐納女士不在這裏。她生病，送到醫院去了。她在聖約瑟醫院。」</p>
<p>桑頓認識聖約瑟醫院的一個實習醫師。便立刻給一個電話，詢問究竟。</p>
<p>「的確，我知道那個女人，」那個實習醫師說，「但她現在已經不在這裏，她已經死掉了。」</p>
<p>「啊！原來是這樣！」</p>
<p>「是的，她起初是生着盲腸炎的，」那實習醫師繼續說，「後來變症而成腹膜炎，一直到咽最後的一口氣的時候，她還是不斷的喚着她前夫的名字。興頓，興頓……她不斷的敲着床，不斷的呼喚。所以，我立刻打電話通知他。他說馬上就來，但他終於沒有來。」</p>
<p>「讓我告訴你為什麼他沒有來的原因罷」，桑頓插嘴說，「他的汽車撞起唐寗街的圍墻裏去了。」</p>
<p>「啊！原來如此」那個實習醫師驚愕的叫起來，這是奇怪了！或者他見不到他的妻子也好。我對於這種事情從來都不覺得怎樣，但是這一次可不同了，我一直難過到她的呼吸完全停止了才罷。她於彌留講及一塊地方，叫做聖布魯諾。同時也哭泣地談到一所攝影室和一個滿佈棕樹的山谷，插在她的頭上的花朵，白鴿在她的手掌上啄食……等等。</p>
<p>「啊！桑頓，那是可怕極了！」她於咽氣這前忽然面露笑容，喃喃的說：「啊！我的愛！我們終於回到聖布魯諾去了……請握緊我的手，我的愛。讓我靠着你。那裏，你是你，我是我，終於再結合在一起了……我倆又去沒一個蜜月旅行了。這是她所說的話，桑頓。啊，那是多麼可怕啊！」</p>
<p>那時羅維爾靠着桑頓的檯邊，急急要看他寫下的草稿。桑頓一面握着電話筒，一面告訴羅維爾這件事情的經過。</p>
<p>「這才是真正的新聞啊！這是的確偉大極了」，羅維爾嚷着，「現在你可以問他，她在什麼時候死去的。」</p>
<p>當電話回答過來的時候，桑頓立即寫下了那個時間。羅維爾看了一下，火速的關照那新聞編輯，說：</p>
<p>「喂！在頭一版留下三欄的地位。一個美麗的女人。和她的有名的前夫。一齣扣人心弦的愛情悲劇啊！」</p>
<p>唐納死去的時間正是是：那天晚上十一時三十一分。</p>

<p>— 溪居</p>
<p>淞滬鐵路為我國敷設最早之鐵路綫，首次通車係於一八七六年六月三十日，（光緒二年丙子閏五月初十日）至今適為七十週年。該綫起於上海，終於吳淞，縱長三十里。興築原因，乃見於黃浦江尚無濬浦局，喫水較深之大輪船無法駛入港，擬用鐵路求溝通之便。歷經談判，迄清同治五年，由英商怡和洋行進行開築，光緒初年，令兩江總督沈葆禎以銀廿八萬五千兩購回。該路最初通至江灣，其後因故又加拆毀。迨光緒廿四年，復撥官欵重築，成為我國最先完成之鐵路綫。其後清廷以鐵路有利交通，迨滬寗路完成後，乃將淞滬鐵路接軌，使之成為該路支綫。</p>
<p>七十年以前，中國海運業已暢通，怡和太古之英輪早已行駛於內河各通商口岸，火車對於中國，復興電車相同，皆為新奇事物。當西商興築淞滬綫之日，彼等尚名火車為「火輪車」，蓋喻其用火用輪推進之車輛也。是年六月底，該路使能通至江灣為止，距預定目的地吳淞猶有數里之遙。</p>
<p>關於該綫首次通車情形，七十年前七月一日之申報，記述頗為詳盡，其文曰：</p>
<p>「昨（六月三十日）為「火輪車」開行之第一日。五點鐘時，西國官員暨士女均陸續而至。尚有在旁閑觀不登車者不計焉。」</p>
<p>一至五點半鐘，客車六輛，分上中下三等；西國官商女士均登車。前面之「機器車」（註：指火車頭）發動，客車即隨之而行。計一刻零二分之久，即到江灣。衆皆出車，游覽江灣風景，並各聚飲。俄即乘車回滬。今日為華人乘坐之日，想必更形濟濟焉。</p>
<p>「至下星期一日起，每日客車搭坐，其價目則自有自動控制刊於本報內（註：據吳淞路有限公司所刊之廣告稱：「火輪車於閏五月十二日則禮拜一起首實行，由上海至江灣往來。車價：上座：每客收洋半元，來回一元。中座：每客收洋二角五分，或收足制錢三百文，來回半元，或收足六百文。下座：每客收足制錢一百二十文，每元十張，來回二百文，每元六張），不多述也。又：昨當開行時，有一西人身帶「拍相機」為拍一照」。</p>
<p>又據七月三日申報載稱：「本埠有限公司所築之「火輪車」已過江灣鎮，去吳淞僅數里矣。公司謂有得工程之半，故上禮拜五先請西國官商試乘，次日禮拜六即初十日又請華客乘坐。凡各行號均送「照會」（註：是即車票）數張，隨人隨時一任執此以作登查之據。」</p>
<p>「余於一點鐘偕褚君陳君至虹口，斯時人猶未多，見車客共五輛，中等者一，下等者四。其上等這一輛，是日未至。」</p>
<p>「華客即持「照會」紛紛上車，並有婦女小孩等，更有妓館中之「娘姨」「大姐」，滿頭遍插珠蘭，桅子花，香氣四溢。」</p>
<p>「余與褚陳二友，在中等車廂內，計每輛車長約丈四五尺，寬約五丈，高約七尺，兩旁有百葉窗可以啓閉。所坐之長椅，有羽紗軟墊，窗洞上左右，有籐紮之梅花眼架，備客置小帽等件也。下等車祇少坐墊與籐架，餘皆相同。」</p>
<p>「車以外國木造成，內外金漆殊潤澤。上有圓天窗二，大約風雨日，兩面百葉窗關閉，俾上可透氣，面放光耳。車之前後，俱有玻璃門，無首尾之異，有大鐵鈕可以互相鈎連，在前者則機器車也。數西人司其事，俄聞放氣聲，在旁之西人亦吹口號，車即搖搖前行，初猶遲，嗣即逐漸迅速，但聞轍軌摩蕩聲甚厲，而人已如電掣飆馳隨之以去矣，乘者觀者一齊笑容可掬，嘖嘖稱嘆，而以為得未曾有。計一刻五分之久，行至江灣，彼處人已衆多，余偕二友出車，登酒樓小飲鄉村風景，亦復可人。」</p>
<p>「至三點半鐘，仍乘之而回，比到虹口，則人已雜亂，蓋皆欲往江灣也。頃刻間五車坐滿，並有中立於車廂內者，然來者尚無休息，西人悉揮之使去，故儘有掃興而歸者，然益見好新奇者之多也。日後築至吳淞，每日間或當往來如織歟？」</p>
<p>據謂斯時主持通車者為西人請帖甚為講究，由公司董事具名簽發，邀請上海各國領事眷屬及各巨商試乘，華人方面包括重要官吏及巨商。西人請帖發出一百五十份，華人請帖計一千一百份，計大車七輛，可載人一百五十。當時申報記述此事，其中有謂「身在車上者，不啻有羽翼，足登烟雲矣」之句，亦可想見彼等對於火車之新奇感覺矣。</p>

<h3 id="c137">維護學術界的獨立與尊嚴 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>學術可以影響到政治的改革，與社會的變遷。但是政治的勢力，不能侵犯學術界的尊嚴，不能障碍學術界的進步。文化的團體與學會，要專門學者，資格最老學識最優秀的人物來領導。歐美學者，要從事政治活動，則失去學術界的地位！所以大學教授，要加入政府的組織，他永遠不能回復他原有的地位！今日中國學術界的獨立與尊嚴，必須維護，學術界專家，也要自尊自重，保障自己的人格與道義！</p>
<p>今後中國入於憲政時期，首要尊崇學術，始能開始建設，不容許任何的政治勢力，利用學術團體來活動。中國素來是學而優則仕，憑藉學術為昇榮的捷徑！因此文人學者，也就被人輕視。再讓世界文化史，意大利復興時代的文士藝人，是何等愛國與熱情，想挽救世界的厄運。但是厭惡權勢，澹泊名利，那種獨立高超的人格，支撐着不傾的大廈，使世界永保留着正義存在！</p>
<p>法國浪跡文人盧梭，反對人為的虛偽而歌頌自然，詩人囂俄反抗拿破崙第三，而留居孤島。還有許多熱烈勇的戰士，與惡劣社會奮鬥。經濟學家蒲魯東，大呼財產是盜贜！生物學家克魯泡特金，謂生存要互助！文化學術，是領導人類進步的！瓦特發明蒸汽機，世界改革了，巴斯德發明微生學，醫學界革命了。從古以來，那有任何極權國家，可以統制世界，不許學術界自由發明，推動人類進步呢？</p>
<p>民主政治，最尊崇的，是文化學術。一國最高的位置，不是大總統與各部首長，而大學教授，與各種學術專家！世界進化，誰也不能包辦，只有專家發明的新學說，可以轉移世界。誰有力量把地球縮小？我們不能推崇凱薩與拿破崙的武力，真能縮小地球，只能說發明電信，與發明飛機的工業專家，他們才能改變了人類的環境，發現了一個新世界！</p>
<p>維護學術界的獨立與尊嚴，這是民主國家的光明運動！政治受了新學術的影響，才能有進步，意大利神經病學家研究理的龍蒲肅，他的著作，影響到各國政府，有了廢除死刑的動議！此其一例，我將此意貢獻到文化界，質諸熱情愛國家愛人類的諸君子之前！</p>

<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>黃昏的涼風，將初夏的暑氣驅走了，尤其是這精緻陶深的院子裏，白天停留的暑氣，早就沒有了。</p>
<p>院子中間的屋子旁邊，有兩株並窗高的白玉蘭，那如碗一般大的花朵，當涼風吹來，便展開了潔白玉擘般的苑瓣，散放出一股透人心肺的芳香；濃綠的葉子，合歡相抱地搖曳着，好像在向這屋子裏的主人，獻盡千嬌百媚似的，還有幾株夾竹桃，正在滿樹紅花綠葉，因為牠枝柔矮細，正好作白玉蘭的陪襯品。</p>
<p>這一間兩層樓的房子，站在這些花木中間，倒反見得格外低矮的樣子，但是就因為有花木蔭蔽，和有寬敞空地的緣故，即使是在深夏炎熱的天氣裏，此地仍能保持清涼舒適，像一個得天獨厚的樂園。</p>
<p>窗裏深綠的窗幔，緩緩的被人拉開了，這就是屋子的女主人徐太太，她在窗前，朝外凝望；打了一個呵欠，好像是剛剛睡起，還帶倦怠神色的模樣。她已是過了三十歲的人了，但由於華貴的打扮，和過着無憂無慮的生活，臉上毫無年華催老的痕跡，看起來仍像二址四五歲的少奶。</p>
<p>「媽媽！我回來了，」這是她十五歲的女兒文珍，散學回來，正跑過院門外的鐵欄柵，瞥見了她站在窗口的媽媽，便很輕捷地揚起手叫着。今天是禮拜六，學校早已散學了，文珍愛和別的孩子在學校裏玩，延遲了回家的時間，可是徐太太平日並不怎樣關心女兒的生活，所以只應了一聲便算了。</p>
<p>文珍跑進與母親隔壁的自己的房間裏，放置好書包，坐在琴邊彈她未練熟的歌譜；鍵盤逐漸地彈得快起來，樂聲悠揚開去了。每天黃昏的時分，只有這琴音，與這院子裏美麗黃昏的情調，能配合在一起。</p>
<p>這時候已經是吃過晚飯了，室內的電燈光照得全屋子通亮；墻上掛的油畫，和書架上零亂的幾本書，都看得很清楚。這房間，原是徐先生的書房，但人上中年，且因職務的忙碌，他已很少到書房裏來坐，現在成了徐太太的休息室。</p>
<p>徐太太坐在沙發裏，好似就將整個身體埋下去了一般，她吸着香烟，昂起头，入神地望着從嘴角裏吹出的烟圈；但是一陣從窗外吹來的晚風，便立刻將那一縷烟圈，吹得無影無踪了，她轉望去窗外，懊惱地又似很隨意地自言自語着：</p>
<p>「昨晚搓了通宵麻將，倒霉就全落在我一個人身上，輸了十四萬，別人說上海的米價最高到了七萬元，便呌做什麼七萬大關，那我倒是十四萬大關了……今天晚上非把它打回不可！」說後像對着伸頭到窗邊來的白平痴笑一陣，把烟屁股率然擲到啖盂去，便挺起豐滿的胸部，伸了兩隻手往頸後，托托披在肩上的捲髮，望着李媽正商了一杯茶到她的面前。</p>
<p>「真的，十四萬洋，在我們鄉下，盡可够花一年啦！」李媽有點替主人惋惜，也想打破這屋子的寂寞。</p>
<p>「不是今天早上再連來了八圈，那我不祇輸這個數目哩。說來也好笑，今早的八圈，倒霉又差不多全是歸姑媽一人，……」不待說完了話，便咭咭的接連笑了一串；接了李媽面過來的茶，沒有喝，放到茶几上去。</p>
<p>「二奶奶倒贏了十萬多，我想，這也要講點人運牌運吧。好像這些年頭，二奶奶男人在外賺得錢了，她也少年發福哪！……是的，是的，太太你也一定不會輸到底的。」李媽總愛拉短拉長的說一套，平時會和主人捧場湊趣，所以徐太太倒歡喜了她這樣的人。</p>
<p>「啊！八點鐘啦！啥夏季時間，天剛黑就八點了，真不像話。」徐太太你在責備什麼人，憤憤地從沙法上起來，去拿了一枝香烟，李媽給她點燃了，便另坐到靠門的長沙發上去，較緩和地說：</p>
<p>「李媽，你把麻將和茶几都攫好吧，姑媽她們快要來了。」</p>
<p>李媽笑吟吟的照常例的移動了檯椅，把雪白的檯布縛緊，將箱子裏的麻將牌攤到檯面，又另去拿了一個裝籌碼的小箱子，把紅綠黃三種顏色的圓圓滑滑的籌碼，按數分配豎立在檯子四個邊緣，因為她是小脚的，人也老了，一切動作都顯得遲滯而穩當，轉來轉去，只有她忙着。</p>
<p>隔壁的房間裏，文珍單獨地在那邊按琴，可是這單純的琴音與這邊徐太太的情調，是完全不相稱的，這不相稱的空氣，很久就存在着了，因為文珍在家裏，除了讀讀書寫寫字之外，彈琴成了她唯一的功課，母親不大理會她，也不知道她從什麼時候起，就養成了這樣的習慣，老是不喜歡去接近她母親的集團，雖然在她的心靈中，或許不是憎恨那種不夜天的糜爛生活，但是她顯然是對那些生活有幾分討厭的。</p>
<p>她停了按琴，側頭向窗外唱着：</p>
<p>「夜來香，我為你歌唱……」</p>
<p>這院落裏沒有夜來香，但四週的花草，也足有夜來香那麼一股馥郁的清香。文珍懂得愛這裏的地方，她常幻想着，用那繩緊的心，給這裏的夜色，舖上一層可愛的錦繡。但是她沒有那樣的力量，所以每天她都是寂寞的睡了。</p>
<p>李媽在徐太太的休息室裏，已將東西弄好了，聽見了樓下的門鈴在響，便踉蹌的走下樓去，一面應着「喲！來了！來了！」也不問啥人，因為她知道一定是姑媽來的。</p>
<p>一開門，果然是肥胖的姑媽，和一個中年的黃師母來了。</p>
<p>「喲！正等着你們。」李媽說着，把門帶上，回頭打量黃師母的晚裝。姑媽和黃師母，不大去理會李媽，便走上樓去。</p>
<p>「今晚我們來得遲了點，」她剛上完樓梯，姑媽望見走出房門的徐太太說。</p>
<p>「好好，我也正在做衛生——休息。」徐太太拉着姑媽的手，拖長聲說得真高興。</p>
<p>「怎麼？那裏什麼衛生休息吓？」黃師母聽見衛生休息的幾個陌生字眼，特別感覺有趣。</p>
<p>「就是阿珍的爸爸說的，他說他不造成我們搓夜牌，要是飯後偶耳搓搓作玩，便叫做「衛生麻將」，他倒是同意這個，哪我飯後沒有事做，坐着休息休息，不也是叫做「衛生休息」嗎？」說後嘻哈嘻哈的笑，幾乎站不住要撲到黃師母的身上去。</p>
<p>「他就是有那麼多怪名堂。」姑媽說着自己坐到麻將檯邊的椅子上了。看看屋子裏只有三個人，她緊接說：「怎麼二奶奶還不來嗎？」</p>
<p>「我以為你們來時順便叫她一聲來的，那麼叫李媽去喊她來好了。」又繼續說下去「往天她倒是來得最早的。」徐太太似替二奶奶辯護一樣。</p>
<p>不待李媽媽出去，二奶奶便在外面叫門了。</p>
<p>二奶奶是住在隔壁的，過來很方便；今晚她穿着雪白的旗袍，修長的身材，窈窕多姿；她上樓走進徐太太的房間，明亮的室內，更添一層光彩。她是在這房間裏年紀最輕的女人，夜裏的臉上，常像從新整容過一次似的，紅灼灼的嘴唇，對她們說：</p>
<p>「累了你們等了。若我不來的話，那麼三缺一，倒使你們吊起來了！」她是俏皮厲害的，說着笑，稍移動椅子入座。</p>
<p>一陣麻將聲響起來，壁上的時鐘正指着八點半，這就是屋子裏夜生活的開始，外面夜風吹響樹葉的聲音，遠處傳來收音機的歌聲，和汽車聲，……都被掩沒在麻將檯的呎撒呎撕的鬧聲裏了，接着便是斷續的肆意的拍拍聲。剛才搓作一團的聲音，像表示了每人的心胸，是多麼的磊落放任，但是到了這拍拍聲，又像將她們的心，收束得多麼緊來，如聲聲咒罵一般去攻擊對方：有時為了計算利局，彼此又像爭吵，又像相讓地鬧着，她們就是在這樣複雜的刺激中，搓着拍着。</p>
<p>起初，二奶奶對過去旺盛的牌運，很能保持舊紀錄，便是到了第六圈以後，姑媽已有起色了，她內心在暗暗地道：「你這少奶心還狠嗎？」</p>
<p>李媽為了照應侍候煙茶，她沒有離開房間一步，她同情徐太太和姑媽，因為昨天夜裏輸的是她們倆個人，現在心坎一張一弛，都為了她們。</p>
<p>時間已過了午夜，是上午一時半了。</p>
<p>李媽到廚房裏替她們下了幾碗鷄絲麺，端到樓上，因和局還未到，她們靜默地顧着換牌湊牌，沒有放下手吃麺。碗裏白霧一樣的蒸氣，搖搖擺擺地上昇，像替她們緊張的空氣，梳開一些謂劑的曲線一般。</p>
<p>吃麺時，她們並不放鬆了神經，眼睛望着各人檯面的籌碼，計算着自己的成績，再想出一些新花樣，好得能出奇制勝，這樣的事情傷她們的腦根，所以大家很少說話。</p>
<p>繼續着搓下去，時間已到了五點鐘購了。</p>
<p>晨曦的微光，漸漸來到這院子裏，外面的車聲又漸漸熱鬧起來。白玉蘭像伴了主人一夜。</p>
<p>「呵！你們算呵！我是和十三檯！」年老的姑媽，突然叫得很響亮，但不一會，便沉靜下去，剩下一些擲籌碼聲音。</p>
<p>呎撒呎撒的牌聲，復響起來，黎明的光線，像無數的小手，悄悄地伸進窗內，和這些人的纖手，搓攪作一團。……</p>
<p>「拍！」一聲，把隔壁房裏的文珍驚醒了，她睜開眼，看外面的陽光，像一條條的金黃，從窗子照進來，她想爬起來，正起了半身，又倒了下去。聽着母親房裏的聲音，腦子裏被一堆雜亂的思想纏繞着，她也不知究竟想的是什麼。發呆了一會，茫然對着窗外，她終於似嘆非嘆般說：「呵！黎明——這就是都市裏的黎明！」</p>

<p>「小華，記得你剛到北京的那天，我隨便說了一句玩話，誰知就把你真地帶進了我們這一行來！如今，我覺得對你抱歉。」</p>
<p>「我不那麼想，石叔叔！我明白這是我媽很久就有的念頭，不然，他不會死七八賴把我帶到北京來，把我帶到北京來，便是為的這個用心！所以，我一點也不怨您。」麗華說。她也確是這樣想。她從來沒有覺得她的唱戲一條路，是石玉樓導引的，自然，石玉樓也是一個客觀促成的原因，如果石玉樓不是唱戲的，墨太太也便無從想到要她學戲。</p>
<p>「你自己呢？你自己是不是很懊悔？」石玉樓很是注意地問她。</p>
<p>「不！」麗華搖頭說。</p>
<p>「你不懊悔？真的！」石玉樓詫異地睜大了眼睛又問她。</p>
<p>「真的！石叔叔！您想吧，我學戲又不是自動的，壓根兒我就不樂意，所以如今怎麼說是懊悔呢？只能說是討厭！對不對？石叔叔！」麗華用文字的修辭法，糾正了石玉樓的語義。</p>
<p>「對！對！你沒有「樂意」過，就不能說是「懊悔！」不像我，我曾經樂意過，所以如今懊悔。」石玉樓頻頻頷首。沉鬰地噴了幾口烟。忽然又向麗華憤慨地說：「小華，你想，我怎麼會不懊悔？我卅年如一日地認真唱戲，把唱戲看作比什麼都重要，可是如今，如今落到這般光景！我得着的是什麼呢？是羞辱，是譏笑！要要從前我不唱戲，把三十年的光陰栽幾棵樹吧，如今也結了不少果子了！幹什麼都可以成家立業呀，只有唱戲，唱戲的結局，是潦倒，是讓你變成一個瘋子！」</p>
<p>「石叔叔，不要想這些等你，身體好，再唱——那時候就沒有人再譏笑您了！」麗華安慰地說。但背過身去，偷偷拭着同情的眼淚。</p>
<p>「再唱？」石玉樓苦笑了笑。「誰還要我？你乾爸爸已經替我去奔走了幾個園子了，他們都搖搖頭說：「金殿裝瘋」，唱成了金殿真瘋，趕明兒唱起「打漁殺家」的時候，再來個打漁殺人，豈不叫我們戲園子關門？這不是玩兒的。」嘻嘻中！他們都把我看成了瘋子！瘋子！嘻嘻……哈哈……」</p>
<p>「石叔叔！」麗華制止地喊了一聲。她幾乎禁不住要哭了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">General Marshall to Fly to Beiping Within Days; Kuomintang and Communist Parties to Continue Direct Negotiations; Slight Progress Made After Two Rounds of Consultations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] The direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party officially commenced at 12:00 noon today at Chen Cheng's residence, No. 8 Putuo Road. Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zhou Enlai, and Dong Biwu arrived, had lunch first, and then began the talks. Initially, the government representatives informed the Communist Party representatives about the National Defense Supreme Council's decision yesterday to convene the National Assembly on November 12. At that time, the Communist Party representatives stated that the postponement of the National Assembly was a decision of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and its scheduled convening now should also be approved by the PCC. Subsequently, Shao Lizi stated that the National Defense Supreme Council's decision yesterday to schedule the National Assembly was because the People's Political Council could not be postponed for too long. Therefore, the decision was made to convene the National Assembly, which demonstrates the government's faithful commitment to implementing the PCC resolutions and enacting constitutional government. As for the reopening of the PCC, it is also approaching soon. Once agreements are reached on the various issues currently under discussion, it can be convened. Regarding the results of today's talks, Shao stated: "Our direct negotiations today are the second time. The issues to be resolved are the difficult problems left over from Marshall's past individual consultations, which cannot be resolved immediately in one or two direct talks. As for the opinions exchanged between the two sides today, they still need to be considered and discussed by both sides after the meeting before further consultations and decisions can be made. It is expected that there will be no time to continue the talks tonight and tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to an authoritative source concerned about the direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party: "The two rounds of talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have made slight progress. If the five-person talks can continue tomorrow afternoon, it may be possible to reach some agreements. The first areas to be resolved may be northern Jiangsu or Harbin. The former is because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has admitted that it is a newly 'liberated area' that is not yet well established, and the latter is because Du Yuming and Lin Biao are reportedly about to meet. It is also said that Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the current situation in northern Jiangsu and is particularly concerned about the plight of the more than three million refugees displaced from northern Jiangsu. It is also heard that if the CCP can voluntarily withdraw from northern Jiangsu, the people will save on food to buy silk to embroider portraits of Zhou Enlai."</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to the CCP spokesman: "The Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have made little progress." It is also learned that Chairman Chiang convened a meeting of important ministers today to discuss matters related to the National Assembly, which lasted two hours.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping 4th Dispatch] According to the Xinmin Pao today: "General Marshall may fly to Beiping within a few days." It is predicted here that the purpose of his trip is to adopt new steps to promote peace in Northeast China and North China.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Both Sides Solemnly Agree Not to Disclose Content <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] It is learned that the central issue discussed in the second direct talks between the Kuomintang and Communist Party representatives at noon today was still the administrative issues after the withdrawal of the Communist forces from the occupied areas. Both sides solemnly agreed not to disclose the content of the talks. However, according to informed sources, both sides broadly discussed the local administrative organization after the withdrawal of the Communist forces from Harbin, Jiaodong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, as well as the issue of security teams sent by the government to maintain order. However, no decision was made. Although the CCP insists on its own views, its proposed request to retain administrative power is tantamount to non-military occupation, which not only lacks sufficient justification but also legal basis, resembling a bandit-style political division. Once the Communist forces withdraw, it will immediately become a state of anarchy. Unless the CCP arranges underground organizations in advance, whether the CCP can readily control the so-called administrative power in these CCP-occupied areas with its small number of Communist troops is something that even the CCP itself may not be confident in. Therefore, more neutral and wise people hope that the CCP will not make this risky attempt, which only brings suffering to the people, and simply withdraw from Harbin, Jiaodong, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. The CCP should openly discuss with the government the issue of retaining CCP party affairs activities after the military withdraws from the CCP-occupied areas, and how to recover the Anti-Japanese currency, which would still be consistent with the party affairs of an established political party.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Economic Planning Conference Day 4: Two Issues Resolved <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Price Control Policy Should Continue to be Implemented; State-Owned and Private Enterprises Should Stand on Equal Footing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Economic Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its sixth and seventh meetings today, morning and afternoon. The morning session, chaired by Wang Yun-wu, continued to discuss the "Price Issues," and reached the following conclusions: (1) Under the principle of correcting the defects of past methods, price control should continue to be implemented, but the scope of control should be reduced, and control over physical goods should be strengthened; (2) Limited rationing can be implemented first in large cities; (3) Emergency industrial loans that have not been completed in the past should be resolved as soon as possible. The afternoon meeting, chaired by Ji Xulun, discussed the "Coordinated Development of State-Owned and Private Enterprises," and reached the following conclusions: (1) The demarcation between state-owned and private enterprises already has government regulations to follow, but in practice, it should be allocated to private enterprises as much as possible; (2) State-owned and private enterprises should stand on equal footing, learning from and competing with each other; (3) State-owned enterprises that are poorly managed must be rectified first; (4) The government should concentrate on running several large-scale state-owned enterprises in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Chu Ni Minyi's Claim of Escorting the National Father's Remains is Entirely Fabricated to Reduce Punishment, Says Bao Wen, Head of Peiping Union Medical College <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Regarding whether the remains of the National Father were, as Chu Ni Minyi claimed in his request for retrial, escorted back by the puppet government in the 31st year of the Republic after negotiating with the Japanese army in Peiping and enshrined in the Mausoleum, or as some say, cremated by electric fire long ago, this reporter inquired about this issue with Bao Wen, a member of the Union Medical College. According to Bao, Chu's statement is far from the truth and is completely fabricated to reduce his punishment. Union Medical College has absolutely no reason to secretly store the remains of the National Father. However, according to this reporter's investigation, Chu Ni did make this trip and held a welcoming ceremony with the Japanese army. At that time, the Japanese army claimed that after they occupied Union Medical College, they discovered the remains of the National Father and handed them back. However, it is impossible to know whether this was fabricated by the Japanese army. It is also learned that the residence of Gu Weijun in Tieshizi Hutong, where the National Father passed away, has been recovered by Gu during his previous visit to Peiping. Recently, Pei Deshi, the principal of the Peiping American Mandarin School, visited the site and discovered that the inscription inlaid on the wall commemorating the National Father's passing, "Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away here at 9:25 a.m. on March 12th, the 14th year of the Republic of China," carved in shaded gold letters on a white marble tablet, was missing. After searching, it was learned that before the Japanese invaders occupied the area, an old man guarding the house had plastered it over with white ash along with the wall to prevent theft. The white ash was removed and the tablet was found to be intact; however, the old man's whereabouts are unknown. It is reported that the house has been occupied by the Chief of Staff of the North China Dispatch Army of the Japanese Army for years, and the scenery is now completely changed.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Discussion: Hopes for a Brighter Political Situation from Now On <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council made a major resolution that the National Assembly would be convened on November 12th this year, the birthday of the National Father, and confirmed that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference would continue to be effective. This is a glimmer of light in the heavy cloud of China's political situation over the past six months. Hopefully, it will be bright and clear from now on, and no longer shrouded in heavy clouds and storms.</p>
<p>China's political situation, from the surface, seems very complicated, but it is actually very simple. As long as the current National Government can truly strive towards the "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army," all difficulties can be solved easily. The topic of "nationalization of the army" will actually involve the unified compilation of the Communist army, which may require more discussion; as for "political democratization," whether it is realized depends entirely on the government's determination, and there is really no other reason that can be used as an excuse for procrastination.</p>
<p>Convening the National Assembly and formulating a constitution is the only way to political democratization. This has been the consistent proposition of the Kuomintang over the years, and the procedure prescribed by the National Father Sun Yat-sen of going from political tutelage to constitutional government is even more so; and preparations were fully made long before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the May 5th Draft Constitution was promulgated. What we find most incomprehensible is why, after ten months of victory, the government has repeatedly postponed it? In the past, because of the Japanese invasion and the full-scale War of Resistance, the postponement of the National Assembly could be justified; but since the Kuomintang resolved to convene it on November 12th last year, the War of Resistance had already been won, and it should have been realized as scheduled, but why did the government accommodate the Communist Party and postpone it again? This was originally something that should have been done by the Kuomintang during its tenure, how lacking is confidence to this extent! However, it can be said that in order to strive for peace, it was necessary to consult with various parties, and this kind of painstaking effort can be understood by the people. But since the Political Consultative Conference decided that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5th this year, and stipulated (1) that the powers of the first National Assembly would be to formulate a constitution, and (2) to increase the number of representatives from parties and social elites, then the National Assembly, which the people had been waiting for with eager eyes, should have been convened as scheduled. Unexpectedly, the government suddenly issued an order ten days before the meeting, announcing the postponement of the May 5th National Assembly, and without specifying a date of postponement, which was tantamount to pouring a bucket of cold water on the heads of the people who were eagerly hoping for a democratic constitutional government! In the government's thinking at that time, it was probably because the Communist Party refused to submit a list of National Assembly representatives, so it had to postpone it again, leaving room for continued negotiations. However, the original intention of the Communist Party was not to solve the problem, but only to delay it, so although it was postponed, the disputed issues were still not resolved. The Dagongbao criticized the Communist Party for "everything is a process, and everything has no conclusion," which really revealed their inner thoughts. To be honest, the National Government, now as long as it automatically and voluntarily transfers power to the people and moves towards the road of democratic constitutional government, who can stop it? Moreover, the people have long demanded it to be convened, and the government has already made promises, how can a small number of parties obstruct it and hinder the early realization of constitutional government and the early success of democracy?</p>
<p>This newspaper's editorial on the 1st of this month said long ago that the Communist Party's obstruction and sabotage is one thing, and the government's expression of sincerity in "the world is for the public" is another. Now the government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th, which is the government's expression of its intention to automatically move towards democratic constitutional government, and also a symbol of the Kuomintang's enhanced self-confidence. We hope that the authorities will see it clearly and hold it steady, and must not vacillate. If the government changes its mind again due to the opinions of a small number of politicians, disregarding the expectations of the people, and loses faith again, then "the people will not stand without faith," and in the future, there may be no way to make the people believe in the government again.</p>
<p>Since the government has realized the truth and is determined to return power to the people, this is truly a sign of China's political situation turning towards brightness. We deeply hope that the Communist Party and other parties will quickly send out representatives to participate in the National Assembly, and must not drag it on until before and after the convening of the National Assembly in November, and then create problems, so that the National Assembly cannot be successfully convened.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Nanjing telecommunication, the reactions of the Communist Party and the Democratic League to this matter are still inconsistent. The Communist Party stated that it had not heard of the government's decision to convene the National Assembly in advance, and that before the reorganization of the National Government, the Communist Party was not bound by any decision of the Supreme National Defense Council. On the other hand, the so-called "Democratic League" even said that "the government's decision on the date of the National Assembly without consultation is contrary to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference." From this, it can be seen that the Communist Party and the "Democratic League" do not seem to fully understand the government's painstaking efforts. The reason why the government convened the National Assembly is to show its utmost sincerity in implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and to show its determination to implement constitutional government. If all parties have the same sincerity and determination, they should send out a list of representatives to prepare to participate in the conference and jointly formulate a constitution, which will contribute to China's democratic movement. We want to respectfully tell the elites of all parties: The National Assembly is originally a conference of national representatives. The national representatives have been waiting for ten years, and no party can be allowed to procrastinate any longer. The government is now following the people's will and respecting public opinion by setting a date for the convening, and the national representatives are also preparing to attend as scheduled. Whether you are elected as party representatives or not, and whether you attend the joint conference or not, really has nothing to do with our people. We, the ordinary people, only hope that the representatives we elected can gather in the capital on the National Father's birthday this year and sincerely formulate the fundamental law of the country. This is the only hope for a bright future for China's political situation!</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou Express Dispatch] The silk reeling industry associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, because the silk factories in the southeast region, after receiving cocoons, are unable to start work due to high reeling costs and huge funding needs, specially telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for assistance, stating: The silk industry this year is facing a crisis. The original accumulated funds have been used to repair factory buildings and add machinery. Although loans were received during the spring cocoon collection, the stipulation that 30% of the down payment must be paid first has already exhausted all resources. In addition, factory properties, etc., are all used as second guarantees. If silk reeling is to begin, it is necessary to pre-purchase fuel, hire workers, and incur huge expenses. The situation is extremely difficult. Without further large loans from the government, it will inevitably lead to a standstill. However, the silk industry is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The manufacturers are extremely anxious and unable to start reeling. They urge you to quickly order the Four Joint Offices to continue lending 12 billion yuan for reeling work. And exempt the down payment and the payment of the guarantee deposit, so that after the silk is produced, it will be handed over to the China Silk Company for unified export management.</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, broadcast on the 4th: The meeting of the four foreign ministers continued in Paris today (1:00 AM Shanghai time on the 5th), discussing the date of the peace conference. The Trieste port issue has now been resolved, and the only remaining issue is Italy's reparations. It is rumored that the four powers may also reach a compromise on this.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd] The four foreign ministers decided today to grant the port of Trieste the legal status of a "free territory." It seems that the biggest obstacle encountered by the foreign ministers' meeting has been removed. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the four foreign ministers have also reached an agreement. Regarding the date of the convocation of the 21-nation peace conference, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes requested that July 22nd be the date of convocation, while Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed September 1st and insisted that the issue of reparations should be discussed before deciding the date of the peace conference, thus failing to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 3rd] Yesterday's meeting of the four foreign ministers, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, lasted for four hours. Regarding the issue of the affiliation of the Trieste region, it was decided to accept the suggestion put forward by the U.S. delegation, which stated, "The four foreign ministers hereby agree on the following points: (1) All land east of the boundary suggested by France should be ceded by Italy to Yugoslavia, and the port of Trieste should be designated as a free territory, extending north from Udine to the boundary suggested by France. (2) The integrity and independence of the port should be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council. (3) The four powers should immediately establish a special committee and appoint members to consult with representatives from the two governments of Italy and Yugoslavia on the entire border issue and make recommendations to the peace conference. (4) The 21-nation peace conference should, in accordance with the procedures decided by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, make recommendations for the free territory, organize a provisional government, and determine its permanent legal status. (5) The permanent legal status of the free territory should be approved by the United Nations Security Council, and the Security Council should submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Charter. (6) The provisional government and permanent legal status should be based on the following principles: (a) The head of the administration should be appointed by the Security Council after consulting with the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia; (b) Legislative and executive powers should be based on democracy, especially universal suffrage; (c) Civil rights related to human rights and fundamental freedoms should be guaranteed, and the local government should submit a report to the Security Council once a year. (Note that the fourth item was added at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, meaning that after the 21-nation peace conference expresses its agreement on the legal status of the free territory, the four foreign ministers can still make revisions, and it will only become final after being approved by the four foreign ministers' meeting. Since it is called final, it will not be limited to ten years, as previously proposed, but will become the permanent legal status.)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the four foreign ministers decided to include the following articles in the treaty with Italy: (1) Regarding African colonies, Italy renounces all rights and all claims. (2) Before the final distribution of the colonies, they should still be placed under the current administrative system and administration. (3) The four powers should decide on the method of distributing the colonies within one year from the date of implementation of the treaty with Italy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 3rd] The Italian Foreign Ministry announced that if the compromise proposal put forward by the French Foreign Minister regarding the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia is agreed to by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, then Italy will lose 783 square kilometers of territory and a population of 276,000, of which 180,000 will [revert] to Yugoslavia. In addition, Italy will only be able to retain the areas of [Gorizia] (an area of 655 square kilometers) and [Trieste] (an area of 332 square kilometers), which it obtained in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The prospect of the Paris Peace Conference being convened before the end of this month has raised the possibility that the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled to be held in New York on September 3rd, may have to change its plans.

However, the final draft constitution will likely be a compromise between the Popular Republican Movement and the Socialist Party, with the latter advocating for a two-house constitutional system. The two sides are currently negotiating.</p>

<p>[British Information Services, London, 4th] The use of aerial photography to map unmapped areas, which was once used in Burma, has become more accurate with the help of radar. Radar, first used to aim bombing in Germany, can now guide photographic aircraft along specified routes over specified areas to take the required photos. Britain has already experimented in some areas, proving the thoroughness and accuracy of this method. Much of the world has not yet been fully mapped. If this can be completed, the geographical survey, engineering, and mining development of these areas can be promoted, especially in areas with large mineral deposits, such as China. The new invention of mapping can save time and laborious treks.</p>

<p>Eyewitness Account by Chauffeur</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 2nd] Hitler's former chauffeur, Kempka, testified at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal today that on the day the Red Army captured Berlin, the Chancellery was crowded with about 500 people, all wanting to escape. Hitler died between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on April 30th last year. He also stated, "Eva Braun was Hitler's wife." Hitler's body was wrapped in a blanket, revealing one leg, "He was no longer the Hitler of those years." "I can assert that he died between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on April 30th. Although I did not personally witness his death, I personally carried his body out of the underground bunker for cremation. I also carried out Hitler's wife." The people left in the underground bunker had split into small groups. Kempka bid farewell to Bormann and Goebbels at around 9:00 PM. At around 2:00 AM, Bormann, wearing a party military general's uniform, near the Friedrichstrasse station, tried to break through the encirclement behind armored units. Suddenly, a shell struck a tank. Kempka was two or three meters behind the tank, and Bormann was next to it. Kempka witnessed Bormann's body being swept away. Kempka fainted but soon recovered. After that, he never saw Bormann again. Based on the force of the explosion, it is certain that Bormann died. U.S. prosecutor Schat stated that Kempka is the only person who can prove the circumstances of Hitler and Bormann's deaths, and this matter is thus settled.</p>

<h3 id="e60">A Letter in the Road Bureau's Major Embezzlement Case: "Female Lawyer" Exonerates Husband. Yu Xiangyan Proves Herself a "Virtuous Helper." She States She Will Surrender Once Recovered to Avoid False Accusations. Facts Remain with Authorities Conducting Rigorous Pursuit. <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The most noteworthy aspect of the Road Bureau's massive embezzlement case involving over one hundred million yuan is that the central figure is rumored to be a woman – Yu Xiangyan, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, head of the Materials Department.</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, this newspaper unexpectedly received a bizarre letter. The envelope was addressed "Yan, to be opened personally, No. 53, Yongfang, North Sichuan Road." Two letter sheets were filled with hurried, scrawled penmanship, and it turned out to be from none other than the Department Head's wife!</p>
<p>Below is the original text of the letter:</p>
<p>"To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao: Upon reading the newspaper, I learned that I, Yan (note: Yu Xiangyan refers to herself), was designated as the absconding wife of the Department Head in the Road Bureau's major embezzlement case, involving over one hundred million yuan. You must realize that Yan is a frail woman, and Hongtu is a civil servant who has served diligently and lawfully for decades, as known by successive superiors and colleagues. He is a specialized technical talent who knows only how to work, not how to speak. I implore the esteemed editor to uphold justice, nurture specialized talents who know only how to work, gather accurate materials, and reveal the truth. My husband, Hongtu, did not participate, and even less so did I. Furthermore, my husband, Zhang Hongtu, reported this matter to Director Chen in early May of the lunar calendar, requesting that all important personnel in the department be adjusted and initially moving to reassign Zhang Bokang. He asked the Director to dispatch someone immediately, but the Director replied that there was no one available. My husband, Hongtu, said that if the Director truly had no one, the Materials Department would have to be Hongtu's responsibility. I recommended an old colleague from the Materials Division (original text), and his resume was submitted to the Director, asking him to seize the time and make a final decision. He replied that he was busy that day and had no time, and besides, the matter was too big and needed further consideration before replying. The next day, he ordered Zhang Bokang to cease working. From that day forward, everything was to be handled by the Deputy Director, with the Department Head of the Materials Department in charge. Esteemed Editor, my husband, Hongtu, secretly consulted and secretly reported to the Director. All of this is documented in signed reports that can be investigated. How can it be that after so much time has passed, it is being blamed on me? In short, there is no fear in doing no wrong, and there are many discerning people in the world. Everything makes sense. Moreover, I have been in Shanghai very little in recent months. The truth will be revealed one day. Yan will surrender to the authorities immediately upon recovering from her illness, requesting a legal investigation to clarify the truth and avoid false accusations. Yan's handwriting is illegible due to illness, and her words are incoherent. Please forgive me. I appeal for public safety."</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter immediately went to the address written on the envelope. Frankly speaking, we originally thought that we might not find this person, but we did not expect to find detectives densely deployed and heavily guarded! It turned out that this was indeed Zhang Hongtu's residence, and they were waiting for accomplices to appear.</p>
<p>In the Road Bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, the Director of the Security Department in charge of this case, carefully studied the envelope written by Yu Xiangyan and told reporters, "It is indeed Yu Xiangyan's handwriting!"</p>
<p>Director Wang said, "Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be considered the principal offender, since she is in a marital relationship with the principal offender, Zhang Hongtu, she is certainly one of the offenders. The letter claims to have exposed the embezzlement, seemingly absolving her of guilt, but if Yu Xiangyan had no ulterior motives, why is she still avoiding meetings? This department certainly has factual basis before prosecuting them!"</p>
<p>Yu Xiangyan is a person who has received considerable education and whose thinking is quite meticulous. She is from Jiashan and is in her forties this year. She followed Zhang Hongtu to Chongqing when the war began. Two years before the victory, she returned to Shanghai alone and registered as a fake lawyer. She is said to be very capable. Reportedly, Department Head Zhang obeys her every command. The twenty-four million yuan that was painstakingly obtained this time is still in the hands of this "virtuous helper."</p>
<p>Why is it said that Yu Xiangyan's thinking is meticulous? She is addicted to smoking, and not long ago, when she quit smoking, she used a false name, Zhao Wencai. She went to Weiguang Hospital in Simingli, Linsen Road, on June 20 to quit smoking. At that time, the Road Bureau had already received secret reports of embezzlement, and Zhang Hongtu had gone to see her. She stayed in the hospital continuously until June 25, but although her smoking addiction had not been completely broken, she suddenly left the hospital - on the very day that Director Chen of the Road Bureau exposed the embezzlement case!</p>
<p>However, Yu Xiangyan did not disappear - on June 28, she went to Dr. Zhu Laosheng's clinic at No. 64, Lane 569, Shaanxi Road for a medical checkup. It is said that Dr. Zhu is one of her relatives. Since that day, Yu Xiangyan has disappeared. The only clue is a letter to this newspaper.</p>
<p>The total amount of stolen money in this embezzlement case is 121.7 million yuan. The Road Bureau seized 30 million yuan when the case was discovered. Later, Director Chen gave a deadline of 48 hours for all parties involved to return the funds. As of yesterday, another 26 million yuan had been received. The accurate figures are still being verified - however, Yu Xiangyan is still carrying the 24 million yuan "allocated" under Zhang Hongtu's name. All seventeen involved have been sent by the Road Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office, but the District Prosecutor's Office is still asking the Road Bureau to cooperate closely and continue the arrest, with the most important target being this Yu Xiangyan!</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The "July 7th" Commemoration Preparatory Committee convened a meeting yesterday morning at the Bureau of Social Affairs, deciding that the memorial service for military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, as well as the public memorial service for martyrs, will be held at the Tianchan Theater at 9 AM on the 7th.

(2) The targets of consolation will be limited to the families of martyrs and wounded soldiers who are on record with the Bereaved Comrades Association and the Military Friends Association. Allied forces from the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will also be included in the consolation efforts. (3) Regarding matters of mourning, it was decided that the entire city will fly flags at half-mast on that day, entertainment and banquets will be suspended, and at noon, the air raid siren will sound for a long period, and all citizens must stand at attention in their respective positions for one minute. Furthermore, Christians throughout the city have scheduled a peace prayer conference for the 7th.</p>
<p>"Another Report" Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, a reporter visited the cruiser "Los Angeles" in light rain. Ferries at the U.S. Navy pier at the Customs Wharf depart every half hour. After boarding, soldiers led the tour. The ship has more than a dozen gun emplacements, with the largest caliber being eight inches. The bow carries two seaplanes, and the anchor at the stern is as thick as an arm. The top of the ship also has radar equipment. The cabin facilities are very complete. The walls of the reading room are lined with books, and more than a dozen soldiers are engrossed in reading. The kitchen stoves are huge, and the aroma of freshly baked bread permeates the air. The clothing room has four or five Chinese tailors busy sewing. When asked about their treatment, they said that in addition to meals, they receive a monthly salary of seventy U.S. dollars, plus "extra income," and they seemed quite satisfied. The reporter toured the entire ship and saw that all the soldiers on duty were still focused on their work, not slacking off because of the upcoming holiday.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Authorized Dealers Grin from Ear to Ear, New Cars Will Arrive After August: Astonishing Black Market for Cars, Each Car Worth Twenty-Five Gold Bars <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the victory, the price of gasoline has plummeted. When we see the price of 740 yuan per gallon at the gas stations throughout the city, and recall the poignant slogan during the War of Resistance, "a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood," it truly feels like "white clouds turning into gray dogs." With gasoline prices so low today, it is undoubtedly the golden age for the car-owning class. Comfortable, fast, prestigious, and cheap, cars can truly be said to be the perfect mode of transportation.</p>
<p>However, "things rarely go as one wishes." The price of gasoline has become cheaper, but the supply of cars cannot meet the demand. If you are merely a "nouveau riche," you may be scratching your head because you cannot buy a 1946 Ford. Or, if you finally achieve your goal under the determination of "must buy," then you must have spent a considerable price.</p>
<p>The biggest reason is that the output of American automobile factories is still limited, so there are very strict restrictions on exports and distribution. The three largest automobile manufacturers in the United States are Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford. They are now using a phased supply method for overseas dealers, dividing the year into four phases. Larger dealers in China receive approximately one hundred and fifty vehicles per phase, and smaller dealers receive only about fifty.</p>
<p>As early as when the war just ended, many "visionary" customers placed orders. At that time, the list price was usually less than 3,000 U.S. dollars, and the deposit paid was only 700 to 1,000 U.S. dollars. Now that the cars have arrived, because demand exceeds supply, a very astonishing black market has emerged. These black market prices, like housing, are calculated in gold bars. For example, the list price of a Chrysler is 2,950 U.S. dollars, but it sells for twenty-one gold bars on the black market. The list price of a Studebaker is 2,350 U.S. dollars, but it sells for fifteen gold bars on the black market. The list price of a Packard is 2,950 U.S. dollars, but it sells for twenty-five gold bars on the black market. In order to maintain their reputation, the authorized dealers still sell the cars to the customers who placed orders first at the original list price, and many of these "lucky dogs" who obtained new cars resell them on the black market. The huge profits they earn may be more than they could earn in a lifetime of diligent work.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few dozen new cars have arrived in Shanghai. It is said that a batch of Fords may arrive soon, and another type, the DeSoto, may appear on the market within the month. There is also an Italian-made Fiat, which has already been loaded onto a ship and departed. If the congestion at the Shanghai docks can be improved, a large batch will arrive after August. Hopeful people who look forward to enjoying the latest styles, please wait patiently! (Feihong)</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the first American Independence Day after the victory. American officials and civilians in the city held grand celebrations, but due to the heavy rain in recent days, the grounds were wet, causing various ball games and outdoor activities to be postponed indefinitely. At 11 AM, Fuzhou Road was bustling with traffic. The Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, Mr. and Mrs. Davis, hosted officers of the army and navy and expatriates on the second floor of the American Club. Hundreds of guests were present, creating a lively scene. Mayor Wu Guozhen and his wife, as well as Secretary-General He Dehui, personally went to offer congratulations. At exactly 12 PM, Mr. Davis read the President's message, and the entire audience raised their glasses to wish the President good health. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. From 1 PM to 5 PM, the cruiser "Los Angeles" was open to welcome guests. The ship was decorated with colorful flags, creating a fresh and new atmosphere. Unfortunately, due to the continuous drizzle, there were few visitors. At 9 PM, naval vessels emitted searchlights, and silver snakes danced on the Huangpu River, with dazzling light. Under the strong light, the fog on the river seemed to be covered with a layer of blue gauze, and the lights repeatedly illuminated the towering buildings along the river, creating a spectacle of alternating light and dark. The French Club on Route de Mayers, and the Army and Navy Club on Route Tenant de la Tour and at the Racecourse held grand dances, with revelry lasting until late at night.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Philippine Independence Day: Filipino Expatriates in This City Hold Grand Celebrations; Singing, Dancing, and Shouting "Mabuhay" <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was Philippine Independence Day. At 10:30 AM, more than two hundred Filipino expatriates held a thanksgiving mass at the Cathedral on Route Ghisi, presided over by American priests McGreil, Lippman, and Phillips, which lasted until 11:30 AM. Filipino expatriates held small flags and braved the rain to board trucks, shouting "Mabuhay" along the way, which means "Long live the Philippines."</p>
<p>At 4 PM, a celebration was held on the second floor of the International Hotel. Approximately 250 people attended, including Mayor Wu and his wife, U.S. Consul General Davis and his wife, Lieutenant General Gillen, U.S. Deputy Consul General Trevor, U.S. Deputy Commander of the China Theater Colonel Lucas, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Guolian and his wife, Director of the Bureau of Finance Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Public Works Wang Shengsheng, and Filipino expatriates. The flag-raising ceremony began. After the music was played, Vera, the Vice-Chairman of the Philippine Independence Day Committee, read a cable from Philippine President Roxas, which stated: "Today, I wish to congratulate Filipino compatriots in Shanghai, and I deeply believe that you will understand the responsibilities of citizens of a free nation. Furthermore, we should be grateful for the freedom generously granted to us by the United States." Following this, Mrs. Davis presented a Philippine flag with both hands, accompanied by four Filipino ladies, to the bandstand and handed the flag to the representative, and the music was played to raise the flag. Mr. Vera narrated the history of the Philippine flag, stating: This flag was created by MacKinley in 1521. Previously, each chief had a different flag, and they were not unified. The white color of this flag represents purity and peace, the blue represents patriotic enthusiasm, the red represents bravery, the triangle represents equality, the three stars represent the three islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Visayas, and the eight rays of light represent eight provinces.</p>
<p>After the band played the Philippine national anthem, the Chairman of the Independence Day Committee, Robert Ago, delivered a speech, stating: More than four hundred years ago, the Philippines was ruled by Spain. On June 23, 1899, the United States defeated Spain and took over the Philippines. For more than forty years, no bloodshed has occurred. The United States has treated Filipinos with a friendly attitude, and today they are independent and free. We are sincerely grateful and will continue to carry on our responsibilities. After Mr. Robert Ago finished his speech, the Filipino expatriates present shouted "Mabuhay" repeatedly.</p>
<p>After the American national anthem was played, Mr. Davis stood up and said that the Philippines and the United States have not only mutually overcome epidemics for decades, but have also cooperated in the economic, political, and social spheres. Now that the Philippine Islands are independent, they still hope to maintain close ties in the future and represent the United States in congratulating all Filipino expatriates in Shanghai on their health and happiness.</p>
<p>After the Chinese national anthem was played, Mayor Wu was late due to official business, so Chen Guolian first delivered a congratulatory speech. Later, Mayor Wu and his wife arrived and delivered a speech, stating: Philippine independence can be an example for other countries. China and the Philippines are neighboring countries and have close blood ties. The United States is also an ally of China. In the future, the three countries should move towards greater cooperation. I represent the people of this city in wishing Filipino friends a bright future.</p>
<p>Finally, more than a dozen Filipino expatriates performed folk dances, which were very exciting. The Filipino women were all wearing colorful dresses, which were bright and dazzling. In addition, there were dancing and other entertainment.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Police Training School Faces Economic Difficulties; Cadets and Staff Receive Only 16,000 Yuan Per Month <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Deputy Director Yu of the Police Bureau recently visited the city's Police Training School, and this reporter also accompanied him for a tour. The school is located on Yulin Road in Yangpu, on the former site of the Shanghai Municipal Council's police academy. The buildings are magnificent, and the facilities are quite perfect. The Director of Education, Wang Junzhou, formerly studied in Germany, majoring in police administration at the Berlin Police Academy. He was a instructor in the Special Police Training Class at the Central Police Academy and is considered a rare expert in police administration in our country. Wang told the reporter that the school currently has 363 staff and students, including 60 female students. There have been three graduating classes, totaling more than 2,000 people, accounting for a quarter of the city's total police force of more than 8,000. The training period is three months. In addition to practical subjects, the first month focuses on instilling political and military knowledge; the second month focuses on specialized skills, divided into six groups: traffic, criminal, foreign affairs, household registration, administration, and female police; the third phase focuses on various combat exercises such as street fighting. The school's biggest difficulty at present is insufficient funds. Each staff member and student receives a monthly stipend of only 16,000 yuan, which includes food and pocket money. The school is truly struggling to make ends meet. The educational level of the police officers being trained is very high, with a minimum of junior high school graduation, and some have even received university education.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Cooperative Factory Planning Group, organized by the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee to establish cooperative factories, held a meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning, determining the principles of the cooperative factories as follows: (1) The government will allocate the factory site; (2) Industrialists will provide the funds; (3) Workers' wages will be slightly discounted based on the current cost of living index; (4) It is planned to first establish machinery, textile, and chemical factories.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Shipping Industry Conference; Firm Attitude to Protect Rights; French Freighter Prevented from Shipping Goods from Shanghai to Guangzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Du Yuesheng, the Chairman of the Shipping Industry Association, and others paid a visit to Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, proposing seven emergency measures to protect the shipping industry. Premier Song gave instructions on each item. It is learned that the Shipping Industry Association specially convened a standing council meeting at 11 AM yesterday morning to report in detail. It was generally agreed that the matter of requesting the revocation of the opening of the Yangtze River ports for inland navigation rights is of great importance to the rights and interests of the national shipping industry. This has been unanimously resolved by the members' congress, as well as joint meetings of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Drivers' Union, the Marine Engineers' Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the Chinese Pilot's Association. Imported relief materials and exported local goods, with the consent of the shipping industry, may be specially permitted for direct shipping. As for the import of large quantities of foreign goods other than relief materials, it is harmful and unprofitable to the national economy. If efforts are made to reduce its costs and encourage its domestic transport, foreign goods will inevitably flood the market, hindering domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce. It is hoped that the government will carefully consider such measures.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the case of the British ship "Newchwang" carrying a large quantity of commercial goods under the guise of transporting relief materials was discovered by society, the government and the people have paid close attention to the attempts of foreign ships to infringe on navigation rights. A few days ago, the French postal ship "Yixing" (Aradell) prepared to transport a large quantity of commercial goods from Shanghai to Guangzhou. Upon receiving the news, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to stop it and has notified the customs, forbidding them to report the commercial goods.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jin Xiong Bai, the president of the puppet Ping Bao newspaper, was questioned for the first time yesterday morning at 11:30 AM by Judge Qiu of the High Court's Criminal Division. Jin is from Qingpu, 43 years old, and has served as an editor for the Shanghai Times, the Shi Shi Xin Bao, etc., as a war correspondent for the Central Daily News, and as president of the Da Bai News Agency. Due to his familiarity with Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang, he was sent to Nanjing in October of the 28th year of the Republic to prepare for the "Zhong Bao," serving as deputy president. The following year, he also served as manager and deputy president of the puppet Ping Bao newspaper. Soon after, he founded the puppet Nanjing Xingye Bank, serving as chairman and general manager. In October of the 32nd year, the bank established a Shanghai branch, where he also served as a director. Since the puppet government returned to Nanjing in the 29th year, he served as a standing committee member of the puppet Frontier Committee, deputy director of the Legal System Committee of the puppet Central Political Council, a reserve member of the puppet Central Committee, and a consultant to the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. On October 2nd of last year, he surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau. According to his confession, he assisted in the war of resistance and rescued Central personnel during his tenure in the puppet position, which is supported by evidence. However, the prosecutor believed that this could only be used as a reference for sentencing and still filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. During the questioning yesterday, Jin wore a long blue-gray silk gown and straight-striped spun silk pants. His hair was already gray, and his face was very thin. He did not deny the puppet positions he held but insisted that he had assisted in the war of resistance and had contributed to the country. Subsequently, defense lawyers Chen Tingrui, Luo Jiaheng, and Huang Jiyuan submitted supporting documents, including: (1) Wu Shaoshu, the president of Zhengyan Bao, provided a letter proving that when the newspaper took over "Ping Bao," the equipment transferred was very complete, his attitude was sincere, and he secretly hid more than a thousand reams of white paper in the walls to avoid detection by the Japanese army. (2) Jiang Bocheng, the representative of the Chairman's Office stationed in Shanghai, wrote a certificate to Jin on August 22nd of last year, stating that Jin "has been running around to make connections and protect and rescue party and outside comrades working over the years, which is commendable. Comrades who come to Shanghai to work from the rear may not be fully aware, please ask him to explain directly or ask them to come to the office for consultation." (3) Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping, proved that Jin Xiong Bai "usually tried his best to rescue Central underground comrades." (4) Mao Zipei fled from the occupied area to the inland and was given a pass from "Ping Bao" by Jin, which allowed him to escape. And a certificate from Yan Fuzhou and many other people in the press, proving that Jin had indeed rescued Central personnel. Yan Fuzhou and others were also in court yesterday to listen. Judge Qiu stated that the case still needed investigation and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gan Deyun, a puppet legislator, was previously sentenced to seven years by the High Court and appealed for a review. The Supreme Court approved it, and the case was retried yesterday morning, also ordering a postponement for further questioning.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Xiaofang, a 45-year-old man from Yuyao, runs the Zhang Zhenji Oil Barrel Shop on Chengdu Road. Because his wife was seduced by Shen Yange (72 years old), who runs a smoking den, and became addicted to opium, she disappeared. On the evening of April 1st of this year at 9:00 PM, accompanied by Wang Beike, who also runs a smoking shop, he went to look for his wife but was unsuccessful. At that time, Shen Yange demanded payment for the opium owed by Zhang Xiaofang's wife. In anger, Zhang forcibly dragged the old man Shen to the police station. Shen refused, and during the entanglement, Shen fell to the ground and died. Shen's daughter, A Dong, filed a complaint with the court, with an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting compensation of 20 million yuan. During the trial yesterday, Zhang Xiaofang testified that he went to Shen's house to look for his wife and had an argument with him, but he never pushed Shen over. In reality, because Shen was old and sick, he accidentally fell and died, which had nothing to do with him. After questioning the witness Wang Beike, it was decided that the trial would resume on the 11th. Zhang Xiaofang knelt down in court and pleaded bitterly, "The Honorable Magistrate, please have mercy. I was going to look for my wife. He corrupted my wife. He died because he wasn't careful. It was Heaven's punishment for him. I didn't push him. I am being wrongly accused. Please, Honorable Magistrate, let me be released on bail." Judge Cao did not approve his request. Zhang immediately took out a bottle of sleeping pills from his pocket and swallowed them, intending to commit suicide in court. The court police and bailiffs were unable to stop him in time. The court ordered the judicial police to quickly send him to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the amount taken was not large, and he should be fine. The case ended temporarily in a tense atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association issued a fundraising appeal for the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu: "The 20 million compatriots in 31 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu suffered greatly from the trampling of the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the victory, they were happy that things would turn around and the sun would shine again, but they were once again devastated by the Communist Party, which carried out the so-called 'three assets and three all' struggles. Every household was broken, and everyone was in danger. The pain was several times greater than before. In recent months, millions of people have fled to Xu, Hai, Tong, Yang, Zhen, Jing, Shanghai, and other places in Jiangnan. Most of them are ordinary people without party affiliation, honest and upright people, who fled in a hurry with nothing. Our association colleagues, out of human sympathy and concern for the disaster in our hometown, are trying to promote mutual assistance and find it unbearable to sit idly by. We are appealing to all parties to generously donate and extend the lives of the refugees without endangering their lives. Gentlemen, please show concern and work together to do good deeds, which will not only be a blessing for our hometown but also for humanity. We sincerely appeal and await your orders."</p>

<p>Enrollment in September, Classes Begin in October</p>
<p>[Xinhua Agency, Hankou News] Regarding the rehabilitation of National Wuhan University, President Zhou Gengsheng said: The school moved to Leshan, Sichuan Province, in the 27th year because of the Anti-Japanese War. Most of the books and instruments were moved west with the school and are still relatively complete. However, the Luojia Mountain campus in Wuchang was loaned to the Central Government to run the Officers' Training Corps. All the school equipment was left for the use of the corps and was not transported to Leshan, resulting in the complete capture by the enemy. After the victory, the equipment was wantonly dismantled and removed. Although the exterior of the school building is still intact, the interior has been severely damaged. After the Ministry approved the rehabilitation fee in mid-April of this year, the repair and equipment work began. The student dormitory has been planned and arranged by the Rehabilitation Committee to accommodate 1,600 to 1,700 people, which is barely enough to live in. The faculty and staff residences will borrow the entire school building of Donghu Middle School to meet the urgent needs. The school's own water and electricity and modern sanitary facilities also need to be restored, but it will take time. As for the school's relocation order, the Ministry originally arranged it in the last batch, but most of the staff and students were eager to return home and requested to be issued travel expenses first. However, they were not allocated transportation and could only go east along the highway. School administrative staff are also starting from the highway. By the end of this month, the school's institutions will be formally established on Luojia Mountain and will begin to operate. New students will be enrolled in Luojia Mountain and Beijing and Shanghai in mid-September, and classes will begin in early October.</p>

<p>Regarding the Hong Kong South China Football Team's visit to Shanghai for matches, a person in charge of the Football Committee stated that they have not received any formal communication from any party. It has been learned that the matter is being initiated by the China Welfare Fund Committee, under the leadership of Madam Sun Yat-sen. Due to the organizers' lack of familiarity with sports affairs, preparations have not been fully perfected. Yesterday afternoon, the China Welfare Fund Committee specially dispatched representatives Ms. Liu Qingxuan and Mr. Fan Yiwei, bearing a letter from Madam Sun, to visit Zhou Jiaqi, chairman of the Football Committee. They explained the preparation process and requested possible assistance from the Football Committee. Zhou informed them that the football season has already been declared closed, and holding matches at this time presents various untimely difficulties. He advised them to hold the matches in late August, at which time the Football Committee and the Physical Education Association authorities would definitely provide full assistance to support Madam Sun's benevolent initiative for charitable relief. After Zhou's extensive explanation, the two representatives from Tan Fan expressed their deep agreement with the Football Committee's opinion and great sympathy. They will report to Madam Sun today for a final decision.</p>

<p>French and Australian Players to Compete for Championship; Only Four Players Remain in Women's Singles</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 3rd] In the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships, after today's semi-finals in the men's singles, only France's Berthet and Australia's Geoff Brown remain. Berthet, the fifth-seeded player, defeated the last remaining American player, Tom Brown, today with a score of 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 8-6. Tom Brown was not a seeded player but gave a remarkable performance, repeatedly putting the robust Berthet in precarious situations. The match lasted two hours, and the intensity of the competition was unprecedented. Tom Brown is only twenty-three years old and lacks experience, making him slightly nervous facing a formidable opponent for the first time. It is expected that with further experience, he will become a famous player. During the first set of their match, an unprecedented event occurred at Wimbledon when a small hole suddenly appeared in the net, forcing the replacement of a new net. It is suspected that this was caused by Berthet's cannonball serves. In another men's singles match, Geoff Brown defeated the famous left-handed player Troloni with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. Geoff, the third-seeded player, seemed to win relatively easily.</p>
<p>Women's Singles</p>
<p>After repeated eliminations, only four players remain in the women's singles, which is practically an American affair. Today, British player Miss Cooley lost to America's Miss Betz with a score of 0-6, 3-6. The final four are Betz, Ponti, Osmond, and Blue.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>In addition, the results of the mixed doubles are as follows: Hopman (Australia) and Miss Osmond (USA) defeated Hartweigu (England) and Miss Hart (USA) with a score of 6-2, 6-2. Geoff Brown (Australia) and Miss Ponti (USA) defeated Destramo (France) and Mrs. Dutt (USA) with a score of 6-2, 6——. Behres (Australia) and Mrs. Menzies (England) defeated Birelli (France) and Miss Ingbert (France) with a score of 6-1, 6-4. In the men's doubles, Bati (USA) and Segura (Ecuador) defeated Linger (Netherlands) and Slawer (Netherlands) with a score of 6-2, 6-4, 5-7, 8-6.</p>

<p>The household registration survey in this city has long been completed and has successively handled four types of registrations: birth, death, immigration, and emigration. However, according to the new Household Registration Law, after the household registration survey, the information should be transcribed from the household registration survey forms into the original and duplicate copies of the corresponding household registration books, in order to be considered formal household registration. It is learned that the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department, recognizing the heavy workload of transcription, which is related to the determination of the people's domicile and proof of identity, and must be handled with utmost caution, has decided to conduct district-based centralized training for household registration personnel to ensure accurate transcription and facilitate future household administration. The district-based method involves convening the heads of the household registration sections from each district office, as well as the assistant staff and the baojia cadres, for short-term training. The urban area will be concentrated in five locations, while the suburban areas, due to their vastness, inconvenient transportation, and accommodation difficulties, will be trained in one unit per district. The training time is four days for the urban area (two days for lectures and two days for practical exercises) and one day for the suburban area. All personnel required to be trained must not evade the training for any reason, or they will be severely punished. It is also learned that the district offices at each concentration location have been ordered to actively find suitable venues and begin preparations, and the training will begin soon.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Ministry of Food Orders Shanghai General Warehouse to Immediately Allocate Relief Rice: Grain Depot Has Discussed Delivery Procedures with the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Xu Kan, Minister of Food, recently telegraphed the Shanghai General Warehouse, instructing Director Ye of the warehouse to immediately allocate 50,000 dan of food rice, which was previously decided to be used for relieving the food shortage of Shanghai citizens, and hand it over to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. Xu also stated in the telegram that 1,700 tons of the rice had been shipped to Shanghai by the Cai E Wheel, 300 tons by the Min Wan Wheel, 590 tons by the Changxing Wheel, which set sail for Shanghai on the 1st of this month, and 490 tons by the China Merchants Bureau's No. 460 iron steamship, which set sail on the 3rd (yesterday), and should arrive within a few days. In addition, the shortfall will be supplemented by 710 tons of Annam rice, which arrived earlier. After receiving the telegram, Director Ye of the grain depot has contacted the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle the procedures for paying for the rice. The Cai E Wheel and Min Wan Wheel have begun handling the delivery of goods upon arrival, and foreign rice can also be picked up tomorrow. It is expected that the Social Affairs Bureau will distribute the rice to various retail rice shops for widespread sale at a fair price tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Few Customer Goods Registered in the Market: Black Market Rice Stalls Gradually Becoming Active <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday saw slightly more business in the North Market, but there was no increase in the registration of customer goods. The market situation remained largely unchanged, with the original prices of goods at each stall unchanged. There was no trading in the South Market, and the future of the grain market is difficult to predict. It has been three days since trading resumed in the North and South markets, but the trend has not yet turned around. The crux of the problem lies in the scarcity of customer goods registration. Because rice shops have received low-priced rice for distribution, they have begun retail sales, but white rice is nowhere to be found. In the Xujiahui, West Shanghai, and the vicinity of various vegetable markets in the bustling city, rice stalls selling white japonica rice have been discovered everywhere, with prices exceeding the low-priced rice by more than 45%.</p>
<p>Flour is sluggish, down 200 to 300 yuan. Oil prices are still exceeding demand, continuing to fall gradually. Soybean cake sales are sluggish, plunging 500 to 600 yuan, and few buyers are available. There are many yellow beans available for sale in small quantities, with prices down slightly by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans are lackluster, sesame and mung beans are so-so. Wheat flour prices continue to decline, with slack sales from various ports, down another 1,000 yuan. Factories are reluctant to buy wheat due to the declining flour prices.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yarn Market Remains Weak: Cotton Cloth Sales Sluggish <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remained lackluster yesterday. At the beginning of the morning, Shuangma yarn once called for a high of 1.44 million, but the market closed down to 1.41 million. Only Hongren yarn went up by 70,000, while the remaining 20 counts also fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Old brands from Japanese factories in Fujian, such as Fengnian and Shuiyue, were sought after by traders from Henan, so their prices did not fall. Retail sales on the street were also sluggish due to the rain. Therefore, most of the colleagues who were squeezed by silver funds were depreciating their prices in order to sell.</p>
<p>The market is still tight on silver funds, while customers are waiting and not moving forward. Sales are sluggish, and the market price has fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. However, the Textile Construction Company is selling very few grey fabrics. Only Yanghe and blue V-word serge are not supplied. The afternoon market saw a turnaround in sales, but the base of the market remained stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Spot Cotton Transactions Suddenly Brisk <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telex prices continued to fall by 3 to 9 points, with the recent price at 31.00, the forward price at 31.25, and the spot price of middling at 31.67. Spot cotton transactions in this port suddenly became brisk. The reason is that the Textile Construction Company had not purchased for four weeks and had an urgent need. They briskly purchased middling and Uruguayan brands of middle grade, a total of 5,000 bales. The Shenxin No. 1 Factory also purchased middling and Indian NT 600 bales, with prices about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Financial Turmoil Gradually Subsiding: Collapse Trend Weakened: Hidden Interest Rates Remain High at Two Jiao and a Half <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>At the opening yesterday morning, the price of red [currency name omitted] was 1.938 million. The financial panic was still very strong, and bounced checks piled up. Holders continued to cut their losses, and the price continued to fall. The centrally allocated price of 1.88 was 1.925 million. After 10 o'clock, it was still difficult to support, and the low price once fell to 1.91 million before turning stable. Near noon, those with capital were absorbing it in an attempt to protect themselves. At noon, the price hovered around 1.93 million. In the afternoon, the turmoil in the banking industry came to an end, and buying interest was slightly stronger. Deferred delivery once rose above 1.95 million before falling back slightly. The result was a further drop of 15,000 compared to the previous closing. Jewelry, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. Hidden interest rates were tight in name only, with interest rates ranging from two jiao to two jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange was relatively calm, and American banks slightly absorbed it, which helped to reverse the downward trend. At the beginning of the morning, it hovered around 2,520 yuan. At noon, it struggled around 2,530 yuan, and the situation gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, the gold market revived, and American currency was also pulled up slightly. The result was a slight drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially weak and then stabilized, and the result was an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous rally. The Guangbang [Cantonese] side's willingness to sell has faded, and Hong Kong has reported a slight increase. There were transactions at 545 yuan yesterday. Indian exchange rate was 675 yuan, and British exchange rate was around 9,000 yuan, both of which were more stable than the previous day. The American exchange rate was nominally flat and secretly sluggish, remaining the same as before.</p>
<h3 id="e110">On the Past and Present of Silk <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Heng Chang</p>
<p>The silk industry has always been the foremost export of our country. Since the 10th year of the Republic [1921], Japan has been aggressively producing silk, taking over our country's original position. Thus, even in China's highest production year (that is, 100,000 piculs of silk in the 16th year of the Republic [1927]), it only reached one-sixth of Japan's regular annual production (Japan's annual production is over 600,000 piculs). Because Japanese silk is of uniform quality and sold at low prices, not only is the American market occupied by them, but even England, France, and other places are penetrated everywhere. After the 16th year of the Republic, various countries in the world, due to preparing for war, encountered economic recession. Production increased, consumption decreased, leading to the general collapse of the silk industry in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic [1930 and 1931].</p>
<p>The lowest period for silk prices was in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic [1934 and 1935], when silk prices reached the lowest point (in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], local varieties were only eleven or twelve yuan per picul, improved varieties were only seventeen or eighteen yuan per picul, and 20/22 silk once reached the 300 yuan mark). Farmers' interest in raising silkworms gradually decreased. Although the government exerted great effort to promote improved breeding, cultivate autumn silkworms, inspect quality, and promote sales overseas, it was ultimately difficult to increase production. After August 13th [the start of the Battle of Shanghai in 1937], farmers, seeing the obstruction of foreign sales and the increasing price of grain, then destroyed mulberry trees and planted grain instead. Year after year, up to last year, only five or six thousand piculs were produced, a truly lamentable situation.</p>
<p>After the victory, the China Silk Corporation put in tremendous effort to lead silk merchants. During the spring silkworm season this year, due to Japan dumping large quantities of stored silk, the American raw silk market dropped from a market price of eleven dollars per pound to nine dollars per pound, with the possibility of further decline. On our side, due to foreign exchange stagnation, sales prices are not high, which is unfavorable for export. Furthermore, farmers' costs for raising silkworms are high, and they cannot sell cocoons at low prices (farmers not selling cocoons can be seen in the practice of making local silk or drying cocoons themselves). Silk merchants, facing this situation, can only pace around anxiously. Therefore, cheap cocoons harm farmers, while expensive cocoons harm merchants. The government does not want merchants to purchase at low prices, causing losses to farmers, and the China Silk Corporation, in order to encourage farmers' interest in raising silkworms, is also unwilling to purchase at low prices, causing farmers to feel disappointed. On one hand, they urge merchants to purchase at a reasonable price, and on the other hand, they provide low-interest loans to merchants to subsidize them. The method is good and the intention is beautiful, truly admirable. As of now, preparations in various places are largely complete.</p>
<p>Estimates for this year show that loan recipient merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces purchased a total of 34,500 piculs (market weight) of local fresh cocoons, and 116,000 piculs (market weight) of improved fresh cocoons, which can produce approximately 10,000 piculs of silk. There are also 8,000 piculs of cooperative cocoons and approximately 4,000 piculs from merchants who did not receive loans, which can produce over 1,000 piculs of silk. The total production is estimated at approximately 11,000 piculs, double that of last year, but only one-tenth of the peak in the 16th year of the Republic [1927].</p>
<p>After completing the purchase of cocoons, merchants' difficulties begin. According to this year's costs, improved fresh cocoons require approximately 140,000 yuan per picul (market weight). Adding other expenses of 60,000 yuan per picul, the total is 200,000 yuan per picul. Assuming that 13 piculs of fresh cocoons (market weight) are needed to produce one picul of factory silk, the cost of cocoons alone is 2.6 million yuan. Adding the cost of silk reeling at 1.3 million yuan per picul (1.5 million less 200,000 yuan for by-products), the total is already around 4 million yuan. All loan interest, advance payment interest, insurance warehouse rent, and other expenses are not included. Looking at foreign markets, the selling price is only nine dollars per pound, and with each picul of silk weighing 133 pounds, the total is only 1,197 US dollars. Converting at an exchange rate of 2,000 yuan per dollar, each picul of silk is only worth 2,394,000 yuan (according to the above prices, this is the price delivered in the United States, and expenses of over 100,000 yuan per picul must still be deducted). Currently, selling silk at the cost of cocoons still incurs a loss of 400,000 yuan per picul, and the reeling cost is completely uncovered.</p>
<p>The high cost of silk reeling is due to three reasons: Firstly, high wages; secondly, expensive fuel; and thirdly, disrupted transportation. Previously, the cost of cocoons for each picul of silk was 900 yuan, and the reeling cost was only forty or fifty yuan (some Zhejiang cocoons did not include a reeling cost, where the cost of the cocoons was the cost of the silk), only accounting for 5%. Now, the cost of cocoons is 2.6 million, and the reeling cost is 1.3 million, accounting for 50%. The reeling cost has increased tenfold, and the management of workers is even more difficult than before. After workers receive their wages, they absolutely refuse to obey management. Therefore, the merchants' difficulties have truly reached a critical point.</p>
<p>In short, based on the current situation of cocoon purchases, each picul of cocoons sold by farmers at 150,000 yuan can still purchase three piculs of rice. Compared to the 24th year of the Republic [1935], when the price of cocoons was seventeen or eighteen yuan per picul, but the price of rice was also eight or nine yuan per picul, allowing for the purchase of only two piculs of rice, the current situation is slightly better. However, the crisis in the silk industry is unprecedented. After the cocoon harvest is complete, merchants are already exhausted and have no remaining strength to start silk reeling. If operations are suspended for a long time, both merchants and workers will suffer. Seeing this situation, farmers will not dare to raise silkworms again. Therefore, this dangerous situation has reached a critical point. If active remedies are not taken, merchants will go bankrupt, workers will lose their jobs, and farmers will lose hope.</p>
<p>The only emergency solution is to request that the government first loan reeling costs to facilitate the early reeling of silk. At the same time, the China Silk Corporation should assess the costs of each factory, set a central price, and the government should purchase the silk at that price, providing merchants and farmers with the small profit they deserve. If this is done, the dying vitality of merchants can be saved. Afterwards, merchants will naturally have a duty to repay the government's efforts. On the government side, maintaining this so-called first export industry will not only prevent its collapse but also facilitate foreign exchange earnings, providing considerable assistance to the country. Subsequently, farmers will be happy to raise silkworms, merchants will be happy to operate, and workers' livelihoods can be maintained, truly benefiting the country and the people.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Striving to Revitalize Silk - Japan Sets Five-Year Plan - Monthly Production of Rayon at 500,000 Pounds <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently instructed various government allocation agencies and factories to re-inspect the 133 million yards of silk fabrics they possess in order to select suitable export items. It is expected that 40% of these will be approved for export.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] The Raw Silk Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is currently undertaking preliminary considerations for a five-year plan for the Japanese raw silk industry. If it can be realized, the production in 1950 will reach 247,000 bales, and approximately 190,000 bales will be available for export. According to the plan, the area of mulberry trees will also increase by 25%, reaching 500,000 acres.</p>
<p>In April, the production of Japanese rayon was 500,000 pounds, but there has been no production of rayon pulp for several months due to a severe shortage of wood for pulp. Therefore, factories have had to conserve their inventories. Whether rayon can maintain its rising production levels depends entirely on whether there can be a sufficient production of silk pulp.</p>

<p>The trend for woolen fabrics last week, Thursday, was stable and flat. Except for summer goods, which saw both explicit and implicit declines due to seasonal sales and environmental factors, the rest generally had a good outlook. Fine wool fabrics were much more dominant than coarse wool fabrics, mainly because both the market and factories were quite short of stock. Most of the American goods that arrived lacked formal high-grade woolen fabrics. No British goods have arrived since the victory, but some are being unloaded in Hong Kong. Therefore, the general consensus is that woolen fabric prices will not fall until a large quantity of British products arrive in Shanghai. Merchants from Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Changsha, Nanjing, and other places have been making purchases recently. Autumn suiting flannels, grass green and navy blue broadcloth, gabardine, original tribute satin, and vicuna are gradually gaining momentum.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Raw Material and Labor Costs Too High - Caustic Soda Production Difficult <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Domestic caustic soda manufacturers find it impossible to produce due to excessively high raw material and labor costs. The production of each ton of ordinary caustic soda requires three bags of soda ash, which currently costs 52,000 yuan per bag (80 market catties). Adding glass sand, coal, and labor, the cost is approximately 350 yuan per pound. All caustic soda currently on the market is newly arrived from America. According to the person in charge of a certain import and export firm, when these caustic soda items were ordered from the United States before April, each pound only cost 80 yuan in legal currency, plus tariffs and shipping costs. By the time the goods arrived, it exceeded 100 yuan per pound. The current market price is 130 yuan for 40-degree and 150 yuan for 50-degree, so there is not much profit. It is reported that 500 tons of 62-degree American caustic soda have recently arrived.</p>

<p>Public bonds continued to be stable. Unified Bonds C hovered around 500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands have stood firm beyond the 400 yuan mark. The price difference between various bonds has narrowed again. Unified Bonds C initially rose to 520 yuan in the morning, but briefly fell back to around 450 yuan before stabilizing. In the end, compared to the previous closing, Unified Bonds A, B, C, and D all rose slightly, while Type E fell slightly.</p>

<p>In addition to being distributed from Shanghai to the interior, imported goods have recently been pouring into Guangzhou in large quantities from Hong Kong, and then transported by water to Guixian in Guangxi, from where they are transported by road directly to Guiyang. As a result, Guixian is crowded with merchants and goods. The Guiyang branch of the No. 3 Transportation Department of the Highway Administration has been urging the dispatch of vehicles from this area. This time, the imported goods include various daily necessities, luxury goods, and fabrics, which will soon reach Chongqing, Kunming, and other places. This transportation route is entirely used by imported goods and has not yet been noticed by exporters.</p>

<h3 id="e118">War-Time Seized Debt Bonds - Ministry of Finance Announces Handling Measures <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, responsible for various domestic debts, has announced that from July 1st, normal payments for all debts will be universally restored, as previously reported. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance: The Ministry has completed the investigation of debt bonds seized by the enemy and puppet regimes from banks in the recovered areas during the war, and has drafted ten handling measures, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry publicly announced and implemented these measures on June 26th and notified provincial and municipal governments to make public announcements and also sent telegrams to relevant banks to investigate and handle the matter. The number of debt bonds seized by the enemy and puppet regimes from banks in various places during the war was substantial, and the situation was extremely complicated. Some were mortgaged or deposited by the Ministry in various banks, some were purchased by the banks themselves or used as reserves, some were mutually mortgaged between various banks, and some were mortgaged or deposited by bond purchasers. These cases were previously reported to the Ministry or announced as invalid. After the end of the war, there were continued reports and registrations. However, since the recovery of various places, most of the seized debt bonds have been recovered by the banks one after another. The number of those that had been sold by the enemy and puppet regimes but could not be recovered was only slightly more than 100 million yuan in national currency. The Ministry compiled and reviewed the seized debt bonds themselves and, in the spirit of leniency and by adopting a simple method, drafted the following measures, which were submitted for approval and announced for separate handling.</p>
<p>(1) For already-recovered debt bonds that have been punched, if they were originally deposited by the government in the bank, they should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. If they were originally mortgaged by the government to the bank, they should be exchanged for national treasury bills for cancellation. If they were owned by the bank itself or mutually mortgaged between various banks, or used as reserve for the Central Bank's bill issuance and savings guarantees, the Ministry of Finance, together with the bank, should affix specially made hidden seals and stamp them with a hard seal for continued use. Those that have not been affixed with hidden seals or stamped with a hard seal should be reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification.</p>
<p>(2) For already-recovered debt bonds that have not been punched, if they have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record and have been announced as invalid, the Ministry will revoke the original record and declare them valid. If they have been reported to the Ministry of Finance for record but have not been announced as invalid, they will all continue to be valid.</p>
<p>(3) For unrecovered debt bonds, principal and interest will be paid according to the bond, and the Ministry of Finance will compile the total amount and seek compensation from the enemy.</p>
<p>As for debt bonds lost during the war due to postal transportation or bandit robbery, the Ministry had previously announced their invalidation as they were reported. It is now heard that the Ministry has compiled and classified the numbers of these invalidated debt bonds, together with the winning numbers of various bonds over the past nine years, and printed them into a booklet, which has been distributed to managing banks and relevant agencies for reference in order to facilitate the payment process.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks continued to weaken at the opening yesterday due to lingering panic. Afterwards, due to the financial community's surplus funds being used to absorb at low prices, they all rebounded near noon. However, the trend was still somewhat erratic. At the initial low prices in the morning, Wing On Textile was seen at 395 yuan, American Asiatic at 2300 yuan, King Fook at 173 yuan, Sun Kwong at 182 yuan, and China Emporium at 145 yuan. At the noon highs, Wing On Textile was at 450 yuan, American Asiatic at 2700 yuan, King Fook at 205 yuan, Sun Kwong at 220 yuan, and China Emporium at 185 yuan. Finally, they slightly fell back again. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the popular large stocks rose slightly, while the small stocks rebounded by half to one tenth. Cold small and medium-sized stocks were all slightly positive, veteran stocks were also balanced, and after the closing the asking prices were erratic. Wing On Company had few transactions and did not rebound after weakening.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially stable but then weakened. Popular stocks like Ewo Yarns fell from 8600 yuan to 8200 yuan, Union Insurance fell from 8300 yuan to 7800 yuan, and then changed course. Because Steel Asia had not fallen on the previous day, it experienced a greater fall yesterday. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Steel Asia fell by one and a half tenths, while the rise and fall of other stocks were all slight.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize the local financial situation, the financial community initiated the organization of a United Reserve of Banking Institutions to replenish market funds. A preparatory meeting was convened at the beginning of last month, and a request was submitted to the Ministry for instructions. It is now learned that on the 2nd of this month, an approval order for the establishment was received from the Ministry of Finance. The preparatory committee is intensifying its efforts, and the articles of association and various regulations are being drafted. It is expected to be formally established soon. Members of both banking and money businesses are members of the Joint Reserve Committee. The fund of the reserve will be set at 2 billion and will issue public bonds as a means of liquidity. All members can offer public bonds, stocks, and various securities and real estate as collateral to borrow from the reserve for a maximum of one month.</p>

<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>Review and Prospect (Continued)</p>
<p>Electricity Supply</p>
<p>According to the April statistics, the total electricity generation in the city was 53.42 million kilowatt-hours, and the electricity sold was 50.72 million kilowatt-hours. On average, each citizen used approximately 14 kilowatt-hours, more than two and a half times the total electricity sold in October of last year, which was 13.15 million kilowatt-hours, averaging only 4 kilowatt-hours per person. The maximum load of the Shanghai Electric Power Company in February (currently, the power supply in Shanghai, except for a small portion generated by French-owned power plants, relies entirely on this company) was 111,600 kilowatts, which has exceeded the company's existing capacity. (The total capacity of existing generators is 123,000 kilowatts, but only 103,000 kilowatts are actually available, as one unit is kept as a backup). The subsequent load is projected to reach 130,000 kilowatts in August of this year, 148,000 kilowatts in October, and 164,000 kilowatts in January of next year.</p>
<p>In order to resolve the difficulties, this Bureau has long been finding ways to remedy the situation. Based on the currently possible increase in capacity, it is roughly estimated that the repair of the damaged generator at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company can generate 5,000 kilowatts around August. The old generator at the Wing On No. 4 Cotton Mill has been ordered to be repaired and used, and it can generate electricity in July, with a total capacity of 4,000 kilowatts. In addition to the 2,000 kilowatts for self-use, the remaining 2,000 kilowatts can be supplied to citizens for use. The Shanghai Electric Power Company has a 15,000-kilowatt high-pressure steam turbine, which is expected to be repaired in October. Turbine No. 16, which was damaged during the war and has a capacity of 22,500 kilowatts, has already been shipped to the United States for repair and is expected to be repaired and returned by the end of this year. The Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau has newly purchased a 25,000-kilowatt floating generator, which is currently being negotiated for purchase. If purchased, it can also be shipped and generate electricity by the end of this year. Adding the existing 13,500 kilowatt capacity of diesel generators at the French Electric Light Company and the 103,000 kilowatt capacity of existing generators at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the total generator capacity in Shanghai by the end of this year can reach 176,000 kilowatts. Furthermore, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has newly ordered a 25,000-kilowatt generator from the United States, which is expected to arrive in the middle of next summer. Then, the total generator capacity in the city next year can reach 201,000 kilowatts, and the city's electricity consumption can be largely met.</p>
<p>Before the increase in capacity is realized, in order to prevent unlimited electricity connections that would lead to a supply-demand imbalance and affect the entire city, this Bureau has organized an Electricity Supply Review Committee to restrict electricity connections. This is an emergency and expedient measure.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental solution, the city should establish a complete and sound electricity grid. This electricity grid should roughly have the Shanghai Electric Power Company in Yangshupu as one power plant, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company as one power plant, the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau establishing a power plant in Longhua, and a power plant also being established in a suitable location in Pudong. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the transmission voltage should be uniformly 33,000 volts, the distribution voltage should be 6600 volts, and the line voltage should be 380 and 220 volts. The lines of these power plants should also be interconnected to form a complete Shanghai urban power supply network (Power Grid), closely linked to each other. Although the companies are independent of each other, they are practically no different from one large organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Land Transportation</p>
<p>Currently, one of the most painful things for Shanghai citizens is crowded vehicles and traffic congestion. We need to understand the root cause and make appropriate corrections. Please first look at the following simple statistical table.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Number and Quality of Vehicles Before and After the War:</p>
<p>Time | Cars | Trucks | Buses | Trams | Rickshaws | Bicycles | Tricycles</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Pre-war | 7,298 | 3,669 | 276 | 452 | 18,452 | 122,048 | ——</p>
<p>Post-war | 6,668 | 4,394 | 56 | 391 | 25,000 | 90,000 | 11,000</p>
<p>(Including 2,144 military) | (Including 2,439 military)</p>
<p>As the above statistics show, before the war, the number of public transport vehicles, such as buses, decreased by 220, military vehicles decreased by 61, cars decreased by 430, trucks increased by 725, rickshaws increased by 6,547, and tricycles increased by 11,000. In other words, the number of personal low-speed vehicles has increased a lot, while the number of collective high-speed vehicles has greatly decreased. The actual transportation volume has been greatly reduced, and the traffic situation is more congested than before the war. The biggest reason for the congestion is the inconsistency of vehicle speeds. When there are many types of vehicles with different speeds, it is not easy to clear the traffic. Before the war, the main vehicles with different speeds were motorized vehicles and rickshaws, but now there is also the addition of tricycles, whose speed is between motorized vehicles and rickshaws, and there are quite a few of them. This situation does not exist in any other city in the world.</p>
<p>Our current methods of remedying this deficiency:</p>
<p>First, increase the number of public transport vehicles. This Bureau has been trying to repair more than 40 buses from the enemy vehicles that have been received and opened Temporary Bus Routes 1, 2, and 3. Recently, we purchased 50 T-234 vehicles from the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau and are currently building the bodies to prepare for the opening of Temporary Bus Routes 4, 5, and 6. The French company's Route 22 has now increased to 26 vehicles, and its Route 21 has also been ordered to purchase 20 new vehicles to resume operation. The British tram company still has 70 trolleybuses, and it has also been ordered to purchase tires and engage in repairs, which will also be able to resume operation in the near future. According to this Bureau's accurate statistics, the total number of passengers carried by various public transport vehicles in January of this year was 597,186 per day, which increased to 855,477 per day in June of this year, an increase of 248,291 per day, which is more than 40% higher than the number of passengers per day in January.</p>
<p>Second, establish temporary management methods for long-distance buses, temporarily allowing licensed automobile companies or transportation companies to add passenger seats to commercial freight vehicles to serve as temporary long-distance passenger vehicles. (To be continued)</p>

(3) Improve the conscription system: (a) Improve conscription administrative personnel and systems. (b) Unify conscription administration. (4) Improve the supply system: (a) Implement joint services and establish supply procedures. (b) Improve the treatment of officers and soldiers. (d) Ensure the implementation of in-kind supply.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the effectiveness of military-political coordination, there are two key items: (1) Use national defense policy as the basis, link various administrative departments, and cooperate closely. (2) Complete the system of all matters related to general mobilization, and coordinate and prepare with relevant agencies.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the promotion and strengthening of national defense science, there are three key items: (1) Strengthen the scientific research institutions of the Ministry of National Defense and promote the development of work. (2) Promote and assist the research and development of national defense science. (3) Establish a policy to guide national defense science, focusing on increasing productivity, improving technology, and improving and inventing weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the path of our future efforts, that is, how to establish and improve the new system, as far as I know, we should strive to encourage ourselves and each other in the following four points.</p>
<p>(1) Breaking old concepts. In general, the reorganization of an old institution, from the old to the new, from the backward to the progressive, inevitably has a reactionary force formed by old concepts and old habits as an obstacle. Throughout history, both at home and abroad, many good laws and good intentions have failed to be implemented smoothly and achieve good results, all because of these old concepts at work. As far as the current situation in our country is concerned, the most prominent of these so-called old concepts are roughly the following three: (1) Being constrained by reality and not seeking progress. People with this concept always fear difficulties and seek ease, thinking that doing less is better than doing more. Although they do not actively oppose, the invisible influence of passive obstruction and indifferent attitude is also great. (2) Focusing on the surface and ignoring the actual. The main focus of people with this concept is on how to maintain their position and how to perfunctorily deal with official documents. As for how many problems have actually been solved and whether the actual problems have been solved, it is not their original intention. If you want to discuss reform and change with people who have this concept, it is naturally not what they like to hear. (3) Being emotional and not asking right from wrong. This concept is also very common in today's society in our country. They originally have no opinion on reforms, but they have deep prejudices against those who advocate reforms. For the same things that should be done and should be reformed, as long as the person in charge is not one they approve of, they will not hesitate to sabotage them, making it impossible to proceed. This concept is really the most undesirable. It is a small matter for personnel affairs and a big matter for the country. If it is not thoroughly eliminated, the country will never make progress.</p>
<p>(2) Overcoming existing difficulties. Any good laws and good intentions will inevitably have difficulties at the beginning of their implementation. Especially in today's environment in China, the situation is particularly complicated. There are naturally many places where we rely on officers and soldiers at all levels across the country to overcome them together. For example, (1) the planned sabotage of reactionary elements. I think everyone can see clearly that the conspiracy of reactionary elements is to undermine the credibility of the government and alienate the relationship between the government and the people. If they know that the chairman is eager to govern, they will not hesitate to create chaos everywhere, making it impossible for him to govern. They know that if the national army is successfully built, everything will be on the right track, so they will not hesitate to launch military conflicts everywhere in an attempt to obstruct it. The difficulties we are currently encountering are no greater than this. (2) Unconscious obstruction. In addition to the planned sabotage of reactionary elements, there are also many unconscious obstructions within ourselves. For example, the psychology that the lazy cannot improve, the jealous fear others improving, and only seeking convenience for one thing and one time are often unconscious, and the result is enough to cause many unreasonable obstructions to the great cause of reform. (3) Insufficient various conditions in the environment. This kind of difficulty can be said to be unavoidable, because China is originally a backward country, with insufficient production and backward science. However, the trend of the world today is that we must strive to adapt and catch up. Therefore, we have to deal with it with the spirit of "if others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." In this area, we must ask people to understand each other on the one hand, and encourage each other on the other hand.</p>
<p>(3) The establishment of a new system. Breaking old concepts and overcoming new difficulties, the purpose is to establish a new system. The basic spirit of the new system is two: (1) It must have the spirit of the rule of law. The establishment of a new system is first and foremost to cultivate the spirit of the rule of law. The chairman has also repeatedly instructed this point sincerely. The so-called rule of law, in short, is to handle affairs in accordance with laws and regulations, breaking favoritism and upholding impartiality, and there are two key points to cultivating it: (a) Assign responsibility at each level. (b) Layer-by-layer control. In this way, powers and responsibilities can be clearly divided, and tasks can be properly allocated. (2) It must have scientific methods. The so-called scientific method, in essence, is division of labor and cooperation. Because there are so many categories of business and one person's knowledge is limited, it is necessary to divide the labor so that each can do his best. However, division of labor is by no means a mechanical division of work. Close contact must still be maintained so that each department does not become isolated and lose the overall flexible application. Therefore, division of labor and cooperation must be used in conjunction with each other, and neither can be abandoned.</p>
<p>(4) Achieving a new mission. After the above points have been clarified, we must further study how to break old concepts, overcome existing difficulties, and establish new systems. I sincerely believe that to achieve this mission, we must have the following three conditions: (1) Have awareness and determination. This is also the meaning of choosing the good and holding fast to it. We must also have a clear understanding of reactionary forces and various difficulties, and we must make up our minds to break and overcome them. (2) Have courage and perseverance. Have the courage to face reality and persevere. Work tirelessly day and night, and do not stop until the goal is achieved. (3) Have perseverance and confidence. As the saying goes: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." It also says: "Where there is a will, there is a way." As long as everyone can have perseverance and unwavering belief, no matter how big or small the matter is, there will eventually be a day of success.</p>
<p>Now that the new system has been established and the norms are roughly in place but still need to be enriched, how should it be improved and perfected in the future to establish a foundation that will last for three hundred years? There are many places where we rely on the joint efforts of our comrades at all levels across the country. On the day when I am ordered to take office, it is a time of walking on thin ice. Reorganizing the army and building the army is our unshirkable responsibility. Let us work together to encourage each other. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e123">Are You Suffering from Summer Fatigue? <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ivan</p>
<p>The so-called "summer fatigue" is not a disease, but a comprehensive phenomenon that occurs after a disruption of summer life. That is, a general decline in appetite, weight, and spirit. So, although it is not a disease, it greatly weakens the body's natural resistance and accumulated strength for nothing. Therefore, diseases are easy to attack, and when you get sick, you are less able to withstand it than usual. Generally, people have poor appetites in the summer for four reasons: First, it is the heat itself; second, it is the reduction of outdoor activities and physical labor due to fear of the heat, which affects the appetite; third, it is the loss of salts in the body due to sweating in the heat, and the loss of salts leads to loss of appetite; the fourth reason is a deficiency of vitamin B1 in the body. Reduced food intake reduces the intake of vitamin B1. A deficiency of vitamin B1 can seriously cause beriberi (i.e., paralysis), and mild symptoms include loss of appetite, mental fatigue, and so on.</p>
<p>Usually, "summer fatigue" is regarded as an unavoidable health defect. When summer comes, people first sigh: "Oh no, here comes summer again, I'm going to lose weight and lose my energy! I suffer from summer fatigue every year." The family members then remind him particularly carefully: "You have always suffered from summer fatigue. Summer is here again, rest more, and eat cleaner things." As a result, those who suffer from summer fatigue still suffer from summer fatigue.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as you solve the reasons for the general decline in people's appetite in summer as mentioned above, you can solve the problem of "summer fatigue." First, there is nothing you can do about the heat, so you just have to let it be hot. Second, outdoor activities and physical labor should still be continued (farmers busy with farming are not afraid of summer fatigue), and let the sweat flow happily. Third, the salts and water that are lacking in the body should be replenished. During the war, the American soldiers in North Africa took a salt tablet with every meal, just for this reason. You don't necessarily need salt tablets, just take half a teaspoon of salt as a tonic with each meal. Fourth, vitamin B1 that is lacking in the body should also be replenished. Eat more beans and peanuts, eat brown rice, don't eat white rice that is milled too finely, and eat lean pork (according to a survey done by nutritionists in Beiping, pork is an important source of vitamin B1 in the diet of urban people). Eating too much oily food in the summer will certainly ruin the appetite, but "vegetarian food in June" is not to be eaten. If you can afford lean pork, I advise you to eat it.</p>
<p>If your child has already started to suffer from summer fatigue, don't feel sorry for him and pamper him. Take him to the playground to sweat it out, then throw him into the water to swim happily, and then feed him food that is both salty and rich in vitamin B1 until he is full, and then allow him to rest. See if he dares to suffer from summer fatigue!</p>
<h3 id="e124">Prevention of Common Summer Diseases <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yueshu</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and the dreaded infectious diseases have also arrived with it. If you are a little careless about hygiene, you may be in danger of getting sick, losing money and life, which is very dangerous. Now, I would like to discuss with readers how individuals should pay attention to summer hygiene.</p>
<p>Cholera is a prevalent disease in summer. As the name suggests, its ferocity is evident. Even in modern hospitals with perfect facilities, a considerable mortality rate is still inevitable. This is because the disease attacks fiercely. Seriously ill patients may even die within a few hours, making treatment very difficult. Preventive measures such as inspection of restaurants, effective disinfection of the city's drinking water sources, isolation of patients, and proper disposal of patient feces and vomit are all the responsibility of the health authorities and will not be repeated here. Individuals should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>(1) "Disease enters through the mouth." This proverb applies to cholera very well. The cholera bacillus directly or indirectly contaminates food and beverages, and then enters the human body, causing disease. If individuals pay special attention to their diet and all food and beverages are boiled or reliably disinfected before entering the mouth, then the disease will not occur. Cold drinks and stale food sold on the streets and alleys, and peeled fruits that are passed through the unclean hands of vendors are all transmission media. Be careful not to be greedy for a moment's pleasure and bring suffering upon yourself. (2) Flies coming and going between feces and food are terrible disseminators of disease. Meals should be eaten in the dining hall, and flies should be driven away and eliminated as much as possible. Food that has been fed on by flies should be disinfected again or discarded. Fly screens, fly hoods, etc. can be used for fly prevention. Fly traps, flypaper, and fly swatters can be used to reduce flies. Recently, the new drug DDT has been invented, which has a great effect on reducing flies. It is advisable to dissolve it in solvent and spread it or brush it on the walls of the room, and use it in conjunction with other methods. (3) Cholera vaccinations should be given. Immunity can last for four or five months, so vaccinations should be given every year. Do not assume that you are exempt this year because you were vaccinated last year. (4) Anyone suspected of having cholera should be notified to the health authorities as soon as possible for isolation and disinfection. Do not delay and harm yourself and others.</p>
<p>Typhoid and paratyphoid are also common diseases in summer. Patients lie in bed moaning for one or two months. Unfortunately, they may also develop dangerous complications such as intestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and cholecystitis, which can lead to death. The transmission and prevention methods of this disease, such as food hygiene, fly prevention, and vaccinations, are similar to those of cholera. In recent years, medical experts have advocated using intradermal injection for typhoid vaccination. It is said that this method is more effective than the previous subcutaneous injection method, and the reaction it causes is milder.</p>
<p>Dysentery and summer diarrhea are both prevalent and serious diseases in summer, and are especially likely to be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the weak. The prevention methods are also similar to those of cholera. The existence of carriers (i.e., people who have recovered from the disease but still carry bacteria in their feces) is an important cause of the spread of the disease. In recent years, European and American medical experts have tried using sulfaguanidine and succinylsulfathiazole in the treatment of carriers, and the results have been very good, which may help to prevent the spread of the disease in the future. There have also been trials of using this drug for prevention, which also seem to be effective.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes multiply rapidly in the summer, and malaria is common. Although tertian malaria and quartan malaria do not necessarily kill people, they cause patients to lose a lot of physical strength and thus cause other diseases. As for malignant malaria, it is often extremely dangerous. The way to prevent mosquitoes is to first eliminate mosquitoes. The methods can be divided into passive and active. Passive methods include using screens and mosquito nets to prevent mosquitoes from approaching the human body, filling in useless ponds and swamps, and removing containers that hold water to prevent mosquito larvae from developing. Active methods include using oil and Paris green to kill mosquito larvae, and using pyrethrum and DDT to kill mosquitoes. The American health and military authorities once used aircraft to spread DDT in mosquito breeding grounds to prevent malaria, and the results were satisfactory. There is still no ideal drug for preventing malaria. During World War II, the British and American armies widely used Atabrine (0.1 gram per day, taking the drug six days a week), and the results were satisfactory. Ordinary people may also try it if necessary. However, this method is not a radical cure, and the skin of those who take it turns yellow, which is quite unsightly.</p>
<p>Poliomyelitis is also a summer disease, and patients are mostly children. The consequences are often paralysis of some part of the limbs. Chinese people are not yet familiar with this disease. Therefore, President Roosevelt's disability was the result of this disease. The method of transmission of this disease is not yet known. In addition to the nasal cavity, the gastrointestinal tract has recently been recognized as an important route of pathogen invasion. Parents should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>(1) During the epidemic period of the disease, if children have symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff neck, and muscle pain, they should be quickly diagnosed and treated by a doctor and made to rest in bed for at least one week. (2) Pay attention to diet and reduce flies, because flies are also a possible medium for the disease. (3) Children should be prohibited from swimming in rivers and ponds that may be contaminated by feces. (4) During the epidemic period of the disease, non-urgent minor surgeries such as tonsillectomies should be avoided, because surgery can often cause the disease and increase its severity.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Preventing National Diseases: Tuberculosis <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Now that the war of resistance is won, construction should be prioritized, but genuine construction must start with the health of the people! The character "健" (health) is composed of "人" (person) and "建" (build), so building talent depends on health as the key.</p>
<p>In this world war, China was victorious, but a third-rate physique cannot be the foundation of a first-rate nation. We must emphasize social hygiene and examine the health of the nation. One of the biggest health problems in the Chinese nation is the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. After this war, due to hardship and malnutrition, the young people and the general population of all levels suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis - that is, tuberculosis. It is the most common disease seen by hospitals and doctors, which is extremely worrying.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis has been regarded as an incurable disease since ancient times. At that time, medicine was not advanced, and most tuberculosis patients were considered difficult to treat. Medical treatment was ineffective, and patients often died. Even those who survived were unable to perform various tasks for society, becoming like useless people. However, tuberculosis is not an incurable disease. Since the advancement of medicine, it can be cured if diagnosed early. According to detailed studies by experts, in Chinese society, where social hygiene is not emphasized, everyone has the opportunity to be exposed to infection. Some of those who have been infected recover naturally without knowing it, while others progress to an incurable state. The mortality rate of tuberculosis is the highest of all diseases, causing greater harm to the nation. The people are not well-informed, and they seek medical treatment indiscriminately, wasting time and money, and delaying treatment, which is regrettable. For social hygiene, the key points of prevention and treatment are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Early Diagnosis of Tuberculosis: Before 1925, tuberculosis experts in various countries believed that early diagnosis of tuberculosis should focus on the apex of the lung, as the disease progressed from top to bottom. However, infections in the hilum of the lung are also common. The earlier tuberculosis is treated, the more effective it will be.</p>
<p>(B) Treatment of Tuberculosis:</p>
<p>(1) Rest: Those living in noisy urban areas should move to the suburbs or countryside, avoiding social affairs. If the disease is serious, strict rest is required, and the doctor's instructions must be followed. It is often seen that young people with the disease are unwilling to rest quietly, but are impatient and active, which leads to the deepening of the disease, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>(2) Nutrition: People need to eat every day to maintain metabolism and life. However, diet must focus on nutrition. Tuberculosis patients often have malnutrition, which hinders the recovery of the body. Malnutrition in children often leads to stunted development, making them prone to tuberculosis. In terms of nutrition, in addition to providing sufficient protein, fat, and various vitamins, attention should also be paid to easy digestion to replenish the body's vitality.</p>
<p>(3) Optimism: It is impossible to be optimistic when sick, but optimism can reduce the severity of the disease. It is often seen that tuberculosis patients are depressed, starting with insomnia all night and a greatly reduced appetite. Soon, they become emaciated, and their essence and blood are exhausted. Even good doctors are helpless. Regret and fear do not help the disease but accelerate its progression. If one can understand life, have a view on life and death, not be afraid of the disease, and have the courage and determination to receive treatment, deal with the tuberculosis bacteria, and have faith that tuberculosis is not an incurable disease but a curable one, regardless of the time limit, and always receive treatment with a happy attitude, then the activity of our body cells and mental state will also be greatly enhanced, our physical strength will also be enhanced, and the disease will be easier to cure.</p>
<p>(C) Prevention of Tuberculosis:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasize hygiene and maintain personal health. Get up early, go to bed early, and get eight hours of sleep every day.</p>
<p>(2) Take regular walks in the suburbs and avoid strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>(3) Have fixed working hours and balance work and rest.</p>
<p>(4) Eat at fixed times every day, in fixed amounts, do not eat too much or go hungry, and pay attention to nutrition in food.</p>
<p>(5) The bed should be high and dry, and each person should live in a separate room. There should be ample sunlight and good air circulation.</p>
<p>(6) Have a health examination performed by a respected doctor every year.</p>
<p>(7) Bowls, chopsticks, and dishes used by patients should be boiled in boiling water, and the practice of separate serving should be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>(8) There should be sputum containers indoors, and spitting on the ground is not allowed. Patients should cover their mouths and noses with a handkerchief when coughing.</p>
<p>(9) Tuberculosis patients should leave their families and receive isolated treatment.</p>
<p>(10) Do not go to crowded places.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Common Knowledge for Pregnant Women <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Shuzhi</p>
<p>Women should pay attention to hygiene in the early stages of pregnancy. In terms of food, it must be nutritious and contain sufficient protein. It is best to drink one pound of milk, one or two eggs, and three or four ounces of meat every day. Supplement with vitamins A, B, C, and D to compensate for the lack of food. After five months, add calcium tablets to help the fetus's bones grow and prevent tooth and osteomalacia in pregnant women and rickets in infants. Keep the body clean, as the skin has excretory functions in addition to other functions. Therefore, it is best to take a bath once a day, and at least twice a week in winter. After eight months, sitz baths are not advisable, as dirty water can easily enter the vagina and cause puerperal fever. Get enough sleep, and it is best to rest for one or two hours in the afternoon. Keep the mind happy and quiet. Clothes should be soft and loose so that fetal development is not hindered. Keep bowel movements regular, but avoid taking strong laxatives. Refrain from sexual activity one month before delivery to prevent puerperal fever and other problems.</p>
<p>Starting from the first month of pregnancy, check with an obstetrician once a month. After seven months, check every two weeks. Prenatal examinations include: (1) measuring the size of the mother's pelvis; (2) examining the position of the fetus and other conditions; (3) checking the pregnant woman's body for diseases. It is best for every pregnant woman to have an X-ray examination of the lungs. If lung disease or severe heart disease is found, artificial abortion can be performed in the early stages of pregnancy. Those with mild conditions can be given special care guidance during pregnancy. (4) Checking blood, blood pressure, and urine. If syphilis is found in the blood of pregnant women, the fetus often dies in the womb in the later stages of pregnancy. Therefore, every pregnant woman should have her blood checked when she seeks medical attention in the early stages of pregnancy. If syphilis is found, appropriate treatment should be given. If blood pressure or urine is abnormal, treatment should be given as soon as possible. Because the main symptoms of toxemia of pregnancy are high blood pressure, proteinuria, and edema, if treatment is not given early, the lives of the pregnant woman and the fetus are in danger. In short, the main purpose of prenatal examination is to protect the health of pregnant women and fetuses and reduce the risk during childbirth.</p>
<p>During childbirth, one must go to a formal hospital for delivery. Never use a midwife for delivery, because these midwives are not familiar with anatomy and physiology and lack knowledge of disinfection, making it extremely dangerous for them to deliver babies.</p>
<p>Four to six weeks after delivery, one should go to the doctor for examination to see if the birth canal wounds and uterus have recovered. Because uterine retroversion, cervical laceration, or inflammation are most likely to occur after delivery. If there are any of the above symptoms, treatment should be given immediately to avoid infertility and other problems in the future.</p>
<p>A brief discussion of breastfeeding knowledge: The most complete food for infants is breast milk because it is nutritious, has the right concentration, and is easy to digest. Moreover, breast milk contains several immune bodies that can enhance the infant's resistance to several infectious diseases. Breastfeeding should be at fixed times, preferably every four hours. After three months, breastfeeding can be stopped at night. It is common for ordinary families to feed their children milk whenever they cry, either because of doting by elders or out of ignorance. As a result, the mammary glands are overworked and do not have enough rest, resulting in less milk, which greatly affects the baby's nutrition. The breastfeeding period for infants should not exceed one year at most. After eight to ten months, infants can gradually be replaced with milk, eggs, oatmeal, biscuits, fruit juice, etc. to meet the needs of the infant's body.</p>
<p>Mothers should not hire wet nurses unless absolutely necessary, because their milk is mostly outdated (more than one year after delivery). Moreover, if they lack knowledge of infant care, it will greatly affect the baby's future.</p>
<p>Pregnancy sometimes does not occur in the uterus. This is called "ectopic pregnancy." The most common is tubal pregnancy. The main reason is that the fertilized egg stays and grows in the fallopian tube. Usually, after six to eight weeks, the fallopian tube ruptures, causing internal bleeding. Excessive bleeding endangers life.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Syphilis in Shanghai and Its Cost <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Binji</p>
<p>Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease that tricks people. The disease is often mild at the beginning, and the patient only feels a little pain, or even no pain at all. Therefore, the patient often does not pay attention to it and loses the opportunity for early cure. Later, the disease goes deep, and even if treatment is given, the effect is very small. In addition, the general understanding of syphilis treatment is not very clear. It is believed that syphilis can be cured with a few injections. It is considered unnecessary to get more arsenic injections, so less than one-tenth of patients receive reasonable treatment. As a result, the number of latent and late-stage cases increases, which is very harmful to transmission. These situations are the main factors for the increase in the syphilis rate.</p>
<p>Although there is no accurate figure for the syphilis rate in Shanghai citizens for the time being, it can be collected from various sources for reference: 1. Refugees - according to the report of the First Refugee Hospital of the Shanghai International Red Cross in 1940: those with positive serum Wassermann reaction (syphilis) accounted for...31.22%. 2. Middle class (those who can afford to be hospitalized at their own expense or at a low cost) - obtained from the general examination results of hospitalized patients at the First Hospital of the Shanghai Red Cross from January to June 1945:</p>
<p>Those with positive serum Wassermann reaction...15.0%. Those with positive serum Wassermann reaction in umbilical cord serum of newborn infants...4.0%</p>
<p>3. Prostitutes - according to the report of the venereal disease prevention and treatment center of the Municipal Health Bureau at the end of May this year: those with positive serum Wassermann reaction...6.2%. Dancers and maids (who were persuaded by the center to undergo examination) with positive Wassermann reaction...about 40%. 4. The syphilis rate among the citizens of the city (the above is for reference) is estimated to be at least...about 10%. Based on the current population, the estimated number of syphilis patients in the city is at least about 300,000. Secondly, based on the modern recognized reasonable method of treating syphilis, let us examine the consumption of time and money: A. Early syphilis (initial and secondary stages) B. Late-stage syphilis, the treatment cannot be generalized, and the time and money required are one to three or four times more than that of the early stage, because the damage is too deep, and there are many that cannot be saved.</p>
<p>Finally, let us estimate the medical manpower and resources for syphilis patients in Shanghai: Assuming that each doctor and nurse can carefully care for 600 patients per week, then, if we want to immediately treat 300,000 patients in the city, we need to mobilize at least 500 doctors and 500 nurses. Calculating that each patient costs 250,000 yuan, the total cost is at least 7.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Everyone, please think about it: such huge expenses; such a large number of personnel; under such a social and economic environment, what kind of feelings should you have?</p>
<p>Modern medicine has gradually entered the field of prevention, which is a natural phenomenon. At the same time, syphilis is an absolutely preventable disease. As long as individuals pay attention to hygiene and restrain their sexual desires, everyone knows this. Then, should the citizens of Shanghai and even the people of the whole country continue to allow this disease to harm them? I think this is our shared responsibility, and we should immediately start fighting the bacteria!</p>
<h3 id="e129">Summer Family Hygiene <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yuqi</p>
<p>It is now summer, and epidemics are rampant. Everyone should have hygiene knowledge to avoid epidemics and maintain health. To make us pay attention to prevention, the essential and easy-to-implement hygiene knowledge is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Be careful with diet: "Disease enters through the mouth," as the ancient saying goes. Therefore, food must be fresh, and drinks must be boiled. Cups, bowls, and tableware should be boiled and disinfected every time. All raw, cold, unclean food and rotten fruits, and watermelons that have been cut open for a long time must not be eaten. Fruits should be washed with disinfectant or alcohol before peeling them to avoid gastrointestinal infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(2) Get vaccinated early: To prevent the spread of typhoid fever, cholera, and other diseases, it is best to get vaccinated early and get vaccinated once a week for three consecutive times.</p>
<p>(3) Keep the residence clean: The climate is hot in summer, and mosquitoes and insects fly around, which are most likely to be the media for various infectious diseases. Therefore, the alleyways and courtyards should be washed with water at any time, and special attention should be paid to the kitchen. If there is standing water, it should be quickly filled with mud and sand, and insecticides such as DDT should be sprayed to avoid the spread of germs.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<p>A Collection of Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e130">Where Did the Rationed Rice Go? <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The Folk Museum requested a re-examination on the grounds of preserving Premier Sun's organs and legacy. Although it has been approved, its final fate is still uncertain. Suddenly, the owner of Guanshengyuan also submitted a document to the Suzhou Qiao and other courts to prove that Chu had rescued many important employees of the company. Favorable evidence is not too much, but based on reason and logic, I am afraid that rescuing a few employees of the sugar company may not reduce the crime. Some say this is a good sign because isn't the trademark of all the company's products the character "生" (life)? This can be said to be an implication that Chu Minyi has a glimmer of "生" (life).</p>
<p>A phone call came home urgently, saying that many rice shops on Huazhong Road and Huasheng Road could not buy a grain of rice. It really came to the point where "even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." I have no choice but to ask the authorities. The municipal government has allocated several thousand dan of rice to each rice shop every day. Why can't I still buy it, and it's not just my family that can't buy rice. So where did the rationed rice go?</p>
<p>The White Waterman Injured In the waterman case, seven witnesses, including the captain of an American merchant ship, were detained by the court in Shanghai for seven days. All their expenses in Shanghai were borne by our government. As a result, the local court paid more than 256,000 yuan. This case is the first foreign criminal case accepted by the court of the Great Republic of China after the abolition of unequal treaties, and it seems rare for the court to bear the living expenses of witnesses.</p>
<p>Gaoshiman Dance Hall was ordered to suspend business for three days and fined 1,000 yuan because it did not comply with the registration. In fact, three days of suspension is enough. Why come up with this fine, which is only equivalent to the price of a pack of Camel cigarettes?</p>
<h3 id="e131">Fall <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The price of gold and US dollars fell slightly yesterday. Many friends who are doing business can't help but look sad. Although they are very uncomfortable, they still feel sweet when they think of the day when they will rise sharply. Reversing and overturning, the speculative industry is about somersaults, and the old hand has his own reason.</p>
<p>The person who created the character (some people have researched that it was not Cangjie) did spend a lot of effort in the first place. Taking the character "跌" (fall) as an example, it is combined with "失" (lose) and "足" (foot).</p>
<p>Losing your footing is a fall. If you get up immediately after falling, you will at most break a layer of skin and bleed a little. If you break your leg in one fall, then it is really a thousand years of regret for one misstep.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that rice not only does not fall, but there is no place to buy it. A colleague has not been home for three days. Yesterday, his wife called the newspaper to report to her husband urgently, saying that there was no grain left at home. She ran to three rice shops, but still came back empty-handed. What to do? The colleague replied: What to do, just buy noodles to eat.</p>
<p>Isn't there 8,000 dan of rice delivered to each rice shop for rationing? And isn't it stipulated that each person can buy one dou?</p>
<p>When this colleague talked about this matter with others, an old acquaintance told him that when your wife walks into the rice shop, she should state that she is willing to pay 70,000 yuan per dan, and she will be able to buy rice.</p>
<p>However, on the surface, the price of rice is 45,000 yuan per dan, and the cost of living statistics is also 45,000 yuan per dan, but in reality, there is no way to buy rice.</p>
<p>Where did the rice go?</p>
<p>The central bank is selling gold in large quantities, and the price of gold is falling; if white rice is supplied in large quantities, if there are no unscrupulous merchants hiding it, the price of rice will fall. Just forcing it to fall will not make it fall.</p>

<p>— Translated by Ting</p>
<p>——A True Story, True Love.</p>
<p>This is a human tragedy. Great love writes for us a heartbreaking story of parting in life and reunion in death. This story was written by Chuck Foster, the editor of the Los Angeles News, based on true reports and published in his newspaper. This tragedy unfolds as follows:</p>
<p>It was almost midnight! Lowell, the local editor of the Los Angeles News published in Denver, picked up the telephone and called Thornton, a news reporter, saying, "Hey! There's a spectacular car accident here. The driver is dead. Quickly investigate this matter. Write it up for the last edition."</p>
<p>After receiving the call, Thornton replied, "I know about this. The deceased is named Hinton, thirty years old, an architect. His car crashed into the wall of a school at 8 Downing Street in the evening. The speed was seventy miles per hour. Uh! He passed away at eleven thirty-one. That's the gist of it."</p>
<p>After speaking, he immediately rushed to the coroner's office to inspect the body, finding a dusty envelope next to the corpse, which read "Architect Hinton." He returned and used this name to search the directory, writing down every key point of the deceased's life: "Yale University graduate. Studied architecture in Paris. Several of the most magnificent houses in Denver were built by him. A leader in young social circles. Married."</p>
<p>Thornton continued to read the news clippings attached to the directory carefully, especially those concerning his married life. The clippings described the scene of their return from their honeymoon. His wife was a beautiful photography model named Donna.</p>
<p>The society column editor of the newspaper recorded: "Mrs. Hinton is even more lovely in person than in photographs. She told me that during their honeymoon trip, they lived together in a small town on the island of Christopher, called Saint Bruno. They lived in a photography studio built on a mountaintop, overlooking a valley filled with palm trees. Mrs. Hinton said: What a beautiful honeymoon trip it was!"</p>
<p>Thornton immediately inserted those news clippings into the envelope. This was indeed heart-wrenching material. But the story was not yet over. He continued to read other news clippings, one by one recording their social life, banquets, and Hinton's career achievements. Finally, he saw the story of their divorce two years later: Mrs. Hinton later accused her husband of mental abuse and abandonment. She claimed that Hinton devoted himself to his career day and night, not even having time to spend an evening of social life with her.</p>
<p>Thornton then hastily wrote up the commonplace death report and threw the draft onto the editor's desk.</p>
<p>Lowell looked with eyes as sharp as a hunting dog and asked, "When did Hinton die?"</p>
<p>Thornton flipped through the draft and said, "He died at eleven thirty-one."</p>
<p>Lowell asked again, "Why was Hinton driving so fast? Where was he going? Thornton, your report is still incomplete. What about his wife?"</p>
<p>Thornton replied, "They're divorced!"</p>
<p>"Then, what about his divorced wife? Find her, ask her what she thinks about this incident. Maybe she will shed tears, or maybe she will sob. Maybe she will tell you some tragic and moving story, who knows. In short, such an addition will make your story perfect."</p>
<p>Thornton listened and, with unpleasant emotions, searched for Donna's private residence's phone number, then dialed it. After a few minutes, a listless voice on the other end replied, "Sir, Ms. Donna is not here. She is sick and has been sent to the hospital. She is at St. Joseph's Hospital."</p>
<p>Thornton knew an intern at St. Joseph's Hospital. He immediately called to inquire.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I know that woman," the intern said, "but she is no longer here, she has died."</p>
<p>"Ah! So that's how it is!"</p>
<p>"Yes, she initially had appendicitis," the intern continued, "which later developed into peritonitis. Until her last breath, she kept calling her ex-husband's name. Hinton, Hinton... She kept knocking on the bed and calling. So, I immediately called him. He said he would come right away, but he never came."</p>
<p>"Let me tell you why he didn't come," Thornton interjected, "his car crashed into the wall of Downing Street."</p>
<p>"Ah! That's how it is," the intern exclaimed in astonishment, "That's strange! Maybe it's just as well he didn't see his wife. I've never really felt anything about this kind of thing, but this time it's different. I was sad until her breathing completely stopped. In her dying moments, she spoke of a place called Saint Bruno. She also talked tearfully about a photography studio and a valley filled with palm trees, flowers inserted in her hair, doves pecking at her palms... and so on."</p>
<p>"Ah! Thornton, it was terrible!" Just before she passed away, a smile suddenly appeared on her face, and she murmured, "Ah! My love! We have finally returned to Saint Bruno... Please hold my hand, my love. Let me lean on you. There, you are you, and I am me, finally reunited... We are going on a honeymoon trip again." This is what she said, Thornton. Ah, that was so terrible!"</p>
<p>At that time, Lowell leaned against Thornton's desk, eager to see the draft he had written. Thornton, while holding the telephone receiver, told Lowell the whole story.</p>
<p>"This is real news! This is truly great!" Lowell shouted, "Now you can ask him when she died."</p>
<p>When the phone answered, Thornton immediately wrote down the time. Lowell looked at it and quickly instructed the news editor, saying:</p>
<p>"Hey! Leave three columns of space on the front page. A beautiful woman. And her famous ex-husband. A heart-wrenching love tragedy!"</p>
<p>Donna died at exactly: eleven thirty-one that night.</p>

<p>— Xi Ju</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wusong Railway was the earliest railway line laid in our country. The first train ran on June 30, 1876 (the tenth day of the intercalary fifth month of the second year of Guangxu), which is now seventy years ago. This line starts in Shanghai and ends in Wusong, with a length of thirty *li*. The reason for its construction was that the Huangpu River did not yet have a dredging bureau, and large steamships with deeper drafts could not enter the port, so it was proposed to use the railway to facilitate communication. After negotiations, it was finally built by Jardine Matheson, a British firm, in the fifth year of Tongzhi. In the early years of Guangxu, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Shen Baozhen, was ordered to buy it back for 285,000 taels of silver. The road initially extended to Jiangwan, but was later demolished for some reason. By the 24th year of Guangxu, government funds were re-allocated for reconstruction, making it the first completed railway line in our country. Later, the Qing government believed that the railway was beneficial to transportation, so after the completion of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Shanghai-Wusong Railway was connected, making it a branch line of that road.</p>
<p>Seventy years ago, China's maritime transport industry was already smooth, and British ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo had already sailed to various treaty ports in the inland rivers. For China, trains were like electric cars, both being novelties. When Western merchants built the Shanghai-Wusong line, they still called trains "firewheel cars," meaning vehicles propelled by fire and wheels. At the end of June of that year, the road was able to reach Jiangwan, several *li* away from the intended destination of Wusong.</p>
<p>Regarding the first train running on this line, the *Shen Bao* of July 1, seventy years ago, described it in great detail, saying:</p>
<p>"Yesterday (June 30) was the first day of the 'firewheel car' running. At five o'clock, Western officials and gentry arrived one after another. There were also many people watching from the side who did not board the train."</p>
<p>"At half-past five, six passenger cars, divided into first, second, and third class, were filled with Western officials, merchants, and ladies. The 'machine car' (note: referring to the locomotive) started, and the passenger cars followed. In one quarter and two minutes, they arrived at Jiangwan. Everyone got out of the car, toured the scenery of Jiangwan, and gathered to drink. Soon, they boarded the train back to Shanghai. Today is the day for the Chinese to ride, and it is expected to be even more crowded."</p>
<p>"From Monday of next week, the passenger cars will run daily, and the fares will be published in this newspaper (note: according to the advertisement published by the Wusong Road Co., Ltd., 'The firewheel car will be implemented from the twelfth day of the intercalary fifth month, starting on Monday, running between Shanghai and Jiangwan. Fares: First class: half a dollar per passenger, one dollar round trip. Second class: 25 cents per passenger, or 300 cash coins, half a dollar round trip, or 600 cash coins. Third class: 120 cash coins per passenger, 10 tickets per dollar, 200 cash coins round trip, 6 tickets per dollar'), no need to elaborate. Also: When the train ran yesterday, a Westerner took a photo with a 'photo camera'."</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* of July 3 stated: "The 'firewheel car' built by the local limited company has passed Jiangwan Town and is only a few *li* away from Wusong. The company said that half of the project has been completed, so last Friday, Western officials and merchants were invited to ride first, and the next day, Saturday, the tenth day, Chinese guests were invited to ride. Various firms sent several 'invitations' (note: i.e., tickets), allowing people to use them at any time as proof of boarding."</p>
<p>"I went to Hongkou at one o'clock with my friends Chu and Chen. At that time, there were not many people. I saw five passenger cars, one second class and four third class. The first class car was not there that day."</p>
<p>"Chinese guests took the 'invitations' and boarded the cars one after another, including women and children, and even 'nannies' and 'older sisters' from brothels, their heads covered with jasmine and gardenias, emitting a strong fragrance."</p>
<p>"My two friends, Chu and Chen, and I were in the second-class car. Each car was about fourteen or five feet long, about five feet wide, and about seven feet high. There were louvers on both sides that could be opened and closed. The long chairs we sat on had feather gauze cushions, and there were rattan plum blossom frames above and to the left and right of the window openings, for guests to place small hats and other items. The third-class cars lacked only the cushions and rattan frames, and the rest was the same."</p>
<p>"The cars were made of foreign wood, with shiny gold paint inside and out. There were two round skylights above, presumably to allow air to circulate and light to enter when the louvers on both sides were closed on rainy days. The front and rear of the cars both had glass doors, with no difference between the ends, and large iron buttons could be used to connect them to each other. The one in front was the machine car. Several Westerners were in charge, and soon we heard the sound of releasing air, and the Westerners next to us also blew horns. The car shook and moved forward, initially slowly, but then gradually faster. We only heard the sound of the wheels grinding against the tracks, and people were already racing along like lightning. The passengers and onlookers all smiled and praised, thinking it was something that had never been seen before. In one quarter and five minutes, we arrived at Jiangwan. There were already many people there. My two friends and I got out of the car, went to a restaurant for a drink, and the rural scenery was also very pleasant."</p>
<p>"At half-past three, we still rode back. When we arrived at Hongkou, the people were already mixed up, because they all wanted to go to Jiangwan. In a moment, the five cars were full, and some people were standing in the cars, but there was no rest for those who came later. The Westerners all waved them away, causing many to return disappointed, but showing even more the many who liked new things. In the future, when it is built to Wusong, there may be a constant stream of people going back and forth every day?"</p>
<p>It is said that the Westerners who were in charge of the opening of the line at that time were very particular about the invitations, which were signed by the directors of the company, inviting the consuls and families of various countries in Shanghai and the major merchants to ride. 150 invitations were issued to Westerners, and 1,100 invitations were issued to Chinese, for a total of seven large cars, which could carry 150 people. The *Shen Bao* described this event at the time, saying that "those who are on the car feel as if they have wings and are treading on clouds," which shows how novel the train felt to them.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Engraving with a Graver <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>The people of the world carve seals mostly with knives, but according to archaeological research, people of ancient times carved characters with a pen-shaped graver. The method of graver-engraving is to collect many dots to form a stroke. Through many years of research, I believe that if one cannot complete it in one breath, how can there be charm? So, I pinch the graver like a pen, charging horizontally and vertically, trying to make a seal. I deeply think it is full of ancient charm, and very different from knife carving. Where the graver reaches, it naturally enters antiquity, it is the music of nature. As for thickness, it is even more impossible for knives to express, from the collections of ancient seals from the Zhou and Qin dynasties, there is almost a feeling of being indistinguishable. I humbly record this for fellow practitioners at home and abroad to discuss.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Safeguarding the Independence and Dignity of the Academic World <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Scholarship can influence political reform and social change. But the forces of politics cannot infringe upon the dignity of the academic world, nor can they hinder the progress of the academic world. Cultural organizations and societies should be led by specialist scholars, the most senior and most knowledgeable figures. If European and American scholars engage in political activities, they lose their position in the academic world! So if a university professor joins the government organization, he can never regain his original position! Today, the independence and dignity of the Chinese academic world must be safeguarded, and academic experts must also respect and value themselves, and protect their own integrity and morality!</p>
<p>In the future, when China enters the constitutional era, the most important thing is to respect scholarship, so that construction can begin, and no political force should be allowed to use academic organizations to conduct activities. China has always been a place where those who excel in learning become officials, relying on scholarship as a shortcut to promotion! Therefore, men of letters and scholars are also despised. Look at the men of letters and artists of the Italian Renaissance in world cultural history, how patriotic and enthusiastic they were, wanting to save the world from misfortune. But their aversion to power, their indifference to fame and wealth, that independent and transcendent personality, supported the undiminished mansion, so that the world will forever preserve the existence of justice!</p>
<p>The French wandering writer Rousseau opposed artificial hypocrisy and praised nature. The poet Hugo resisted Napoleon III and stayed on an isolated island. There were also many ardent and brave warriors who fought against a bad society. The economist Proudhon exclaimed that property is theft! The biologist Kropotkin said that survival requires mutual assistance! Culture and scholarship are leading mankind to progress! Watt invented the steam engine, and the world was reformed. Pasteur invented microbiology, and the medical world was revolutionized. Since ancient times, has there ever been any totalitarian country that could control the world and not allow the academic world to freely invent and promote human progress?</p>
<p>Democratic politics most respects culture and scholarship. The highest positions in a country are not the President and the heads of various departments, but university professors and various academic experts! No one can monopolize the evolution of the world, only the new theories invented by experts can shift the world. Who has the power to shrink the earth? We cannot promote the military force of Caesar and Napoleon, they truly cannot shrink the earth, we can only say that the industrial experts who invented the telegraph and invented the airplane, they can change the human environment and discover a new world!</p>
<p>Safeguarding the independence and dignity of the academic world is the shining movement of democratic countries! Politics can only progress when it is influenced by new scholarship. The research of the Italian neurologist Lombroso on the brain influenced governments in various countries, leading to motions to abolish the death penalty! This is one example, and I offer this idea to the cultural world, to all the gentlemen who passionately love the country and love mankind!</p>

<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>The cool evening breeze drove away the summer heat, especially in this exquisitely deep courtyard, where the heat of the day had long dissipated.</p>
<p>Next to the house in the middle of the courtyard, there were two magnolia trees as tall as the windows. When the cool breeze blew, their bowl-sized blossoms unfolded their pure white, jade-like petals, releasing a fragrance that penetrated the heart and lungs. The dense green leaves swayed together, as if offering their beauty to the master of the house. Several oleander bushes, covered in red flowers and green leaves, served as a perfect complement to the white magnolias due to their soft, short branches.</p>
<p>This two-story house, standing amidst the flowers and trees, appeared particularly short and low. However, because of the shade provided by the flowers and trees, and the spacious open area, it remained cool and comfortable even in the hot summer weather, like a uniquely blessed paradise.</p>
<p>The deep green curtains in the window were slowly drawn aside. This was Mrs. Xu, the mistress of the house. She stood at the window, gazing outward, yawning as if she had just woken up, still with a weary look. Although she was over thirty years old, her luxurious attire and carefree life had left no trace of aging on her face, making her still look like a young lady in her early twenties.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm back!" This was her fifteen-year-old daughter, Wenzhen, returning from school. She ran past the iron railings outside the courtyard gate, catching sight of her mother standing in the window, and cheerfully called out. Today was Saturday, and school had been dismissed early. Wenzhen loved to play with other children at school, delaying her return home. However, Mrs. Xu rarely paid attention to her daughter's life, so she simply responded with a single word.</p>
<p>Wenzhen ran into her own room, next to her mother's, placed her schoolbag down, and sat at the piano to play a song she hadn't fully mastered. The keyboard gradually played faster, and the music flowed out. Every evening, only this piano music, combined with the beautiful twilight mood of the courtyard, felt right.</p>
<p>It was already after dinner, and the electric lights illuminated the entire room. The oil paintings on the wall and the scattered books on the bookshelf were clearly visible. This room was originally Mr. Xu's study, but as he had reached middle age and was busy with work, he rarely sat in the study anymore, and it had now become Mrs. Xu's lounge.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu sat on the sofa, seeming to bury her entire body into it. She smoked a cigarette, lifting her head and gazing intently at the smoke rings she blew from her lips. However, a gust of evening wind from the window quickly dispersed the smoke, leaving no trace. She turned to look out the window, annoyed, and almost casually muttered to herself:</p>
<p>"Last night I played mahjong all night, and the bad luck fell entirely on me. I lost one hundred and forty thousand. People say that the price of rice in Shanghai is at most seventy thousand, which they call the 'seventy thousand mark,' but I'm at the 'one hundred and forty thousand mark'... Tonight I must win it all back!" After saying this, she smiled foolishly at the white magnolia reaching towards the window, and abruptly threw the cigarette butt into the spittoon. Then she straightened her full chest, reached both hands behind her neck, and adjusted the curls draped over her shoulders, watching as Li Ma brought a cup of tea to her.</p>
<p>"Really, one hundred and forty thousand yuan, in our hometown, it would be enough to spend for a year!" Li Ma felt a little sorry for her master, and also wanted to break the silence of the room.</p>
<p>"If I hadn't played another eight rounds this morning, I would have lost more than that. It's funny, almost all the bad luck in this morning's eight rounds fell on my aunt... " Before she finished speaking, she giggled a series of laughs. She took the tea from Li Ma, but didn't drink it, placing it on the coffee table instead.</p>
<p>"Second Madam has won more than one hundred thousand. I think it also depends on luck. It seems that in recent years, Second Madam's husband has been earning money outside, and she has also prospered in her youth! ... Yes, yes, Madam, you will certainly not lose forever." Li Ma always loved to tell long, drawn-out stories, flattering and humoring her mistress, so Mrs. Xu liked her kind of person.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's eight o'clock! This summer time, it's only just dark and it's already eight, it's outrageous." Mrs. Xu, as if blaming someone, got up angrily from the sofa, took a cigarette, and Li Ma lit it for her. She then sat down on the long sofa near the door, and said more calmly:</p>
<p>"Li Ma, you should set up the mahjong and coffee table, Aunt and them are coming soon."</p>
<p>Li Ma smiled and moved the tables and chairs as usual, tightened the snow-white tablecloth, spread the mahjong tiles from the box onto the table, and took another small box filled with chips, arranging the red, green, and yellow round and smooth chips in numerical order along the four edges of the table. Because she had bound feet and was old, all her movements seemed slow and steady. Back and forth, she was the only one busy.</p>
<p>In the next room, Wenzhen was playing the piano alone, but the simple piano music was completely out of sync with Mrs. Xu's mood. This mismatched atmosphere had been present for a long time, because Wenzhen, besides reading and writing, played the piano as her only task. Her mother didn't pay much attention to her, and didn't know when she developed such a habit, always disliking to approach her mother's group. Although in her heart, she might not hate that kind of decadent life, she clearly felt somewhat disgusted by those activities.</p>
<p>She stopped playing the piano, tilted her head towards the window, and sang:</p>
<p>"Night-blooming jasmine, I sing for you..."</p>
<p>There were no night-blooming jasmine in this courtyard, but the surrounding flowers and plants had a rich, sweet fragrance like night-blooming jasmine. Wenzhen understood how to love this place. She often imagined using her tightly held heart to cover the night here with a layer of lovely brocade. But she didn't have that power, so she went to sleep lonely every day.</p>
<p>Li Ma had already prepared everything in Mrs. Xu's lounge, and heard the doorbell ringing downstairs. She staggered down the stairs, responding with "Oh! They're here! They're here!" without asking who it was, because she knew it must be the aunt.</p>
<p>As soon as she opened the door, it was indeed the plump aunt and a middle-aged Mrs. Huang.</p>
<p>"Oh! We were just waiting for you," Li Ma said, closing the door and turning to look at Mrs. Huang's evening dress. The aunt and Mrs. Huang didn't pay much attention to Li Ma, and walked upstairs.</p>
<p>"We're a little late tonight," she said, just as she finished climbing the stairs. The aunt saw Mrs. Xu walking out of the room and said.</p>
<p>"It's alright, I was just doing some health -- resting." Mrs. Xu held the aunt's hand and said with a prolonged voice, sounding very happy.</p>
<p>"What? What kind of health rest is that?" Mrs. Huang found the unfamiliar words "health rest" particularly interesting.</p>
<p>"It's what Azhen's father said. He said he wouldn't object to us playing mahjong at night, as long as we play casually for fun after dinner, which he calls 'health mahjong'. If I have nothing to do after dinner, sitting and resting, isn't that also called 'health rest'?" After saying this, she giggled and laughed, almost unable to stand and about to fall onto Mrs. Huang.</p>
<p>"He always has so many strange names," the aunt said, sitting down in the chair at the mahjong table. Seeing that there were only three people in the room, she immediately added: "Why isn't Second Madam here yet?"</p>
<p>"I thought you would call her when you came. Well, then I'll have Li Ma call her." She continued, "She always comes the earliest." Mrs. Xu seemed to be defending Second Madam.</p>
<p>Before Li Ma could go out, Second Madam called at the door outside.</p>
<p>Second Madam lived next door, so it was very convenient to come over. Tonight, she wore a snow-white cheongsam, and her slender figure was graceful and charming. She walked upstairs and into Mrs. Xu's room, and the bright interior added another layer of radiance. She was the youngest woman in the room, and her face at night always seemed to have been freshly made up. Her bright red lips said to them:</p>
<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting. If I didn't come, then you would be one short, leaving you hanging!" She was playful and sharp, saying with a smile, moving her chair slightly to sit down.</p>
<p>The sound of mahjong tiles rose up, and the clock on the wall pointed to half-past eight. This was the beginning of the nightlife in the house. Outside, the sound of the night wind blowing through the leaves, the singing from a radio in the distance, and the sound of cars... were all drowned out by the noisy sound of the mahjong tiles. Just now the sound of everyone squeezing together, like a declaration that everyone's hearts are so open and indulgent, but now with this pat pat sound, it is as if their hearts are tightened up a lot, like attacking the other party like a curse: sometimes for the calculation of profit-making bureau, and each other like arguing, like giving way to the noisy, they are in such a complex stimulus, rubbing patting.</p>
<p>Initially, Second Madam was able to maintain her old record with her past strong luck in mahjong. However, after the sixth round, the aunt began to improve, and she secretly thought to herself: "Is your young lady's heart still ruthless?"</p>
<p>Li Ma didn't leave the room for a step in order to attend to smoke and tea. She sympathized with Mrs. Xu and the aunt, because they were the two who had lost the night before, and now their hearts were expanding and contracting, all for them.</p>
<p>The time had passed midnight, and it was half-past one in the morning.</p>
<p>Li Ma went to the kitchen to make a few bowls of chicken noodle soup for them, and brought them upstairs. Because the game hadn't ended yet, they silently concentrated on changing and putting together their tiles, without putting down their hands to eat the noodles. The white mist-like steam in the bowls rose and swayed, like combing out some gentle curves for their tense air.</p>
<p>When eating the noodles, they didn't relax their nerves, watching the chips on each person's table, calculating their own scores, and trying to come up with some new tricks to win unexpectedly. Such things hurt their brains, so everyone rarely spoke.</p>
<p>Continuing to play, the time had reached five o'clock.</p>
<p>The faint light of dawn gradually came into this courtyard, and the sound of cars outside gradually became lively again. The white magnolias seemed to have accompanied their master all night.</p>
<p>"Ah! You calculate! I have won with thirteen tiles!" The elderly aunt suddenly shouted very loudly, but after a while, she calmed down, leaving only the sound of throwing chips.</p>
<p>The sound of mahjong tiles resumed, and the light of dawn, like countless small hands, quietly reached into the window, mixing with the slender hands of these people, stirring together...</p>
<p>"Bang!" A sound woke Wenzhen in the next room. She opened her eyes, saw the sunlight outside, like golden streaks, shining in from the window. She wanted to get up, just raised half of her body, and then fell back down. Listening to the sound in her mother's room, her brain was tangled with a pile of messy thoughts, and she didn't know exactly what she was thinking. After staring blankly for a while, she looked out the window, and finally said, almost like a sigh: "Ah! Dawn - this is the dawn in the city!"</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua, remember the day you first arrived in Beijing, I casually said something in jest, who knew it would actually lead you into our profession! Now, I feel apologetic to you."</p>
<p>"I don't think so, Uncle Shi! I understand that this was a thought my mother had for a long time, otherwise, she wouldn't have stubbornly brought me to Beijing. Bringing me to Beijing was for this purpose! So, I don't blame you at all." Lihua said. She indeed thought this way. She never felt that her path to acting was guided by Shi Yulou. Naturally, Shi Yulou was also an objective cause. If Shi Yulou was not an actor, Mrs. Mo would not have thought of having her learn acting.</p>
<p>"What about yourself? Do you yourself feel regretful?" Shi Yulou asked her very attentively.</p>
<p>"No!" Lihua shook her head and said.</p>
<p>"You don't regret it? Really!" Shi Yulou widened his eyes in surprise and asked her again.</p>
<p>"Really! Uncle Shi! Think about it, my learning acting was not voluntary, I didn't want to at all, so how can you say I regret it now? I can only say I dislike it! Right? Uncle Shi!" Lihua corrected Shi Yulou's semantics using literary rhetoric.</p>
<p>"Right! Right! You never 'wanted to,' so you can't say you 'regret it!' Unlike me, I once wanted to, so now I regret it!" Shi Yulou nodded frequently. He puffed out a few mouthfuls of smoke gloomily. Suddenly, he said to Lihua indignantly: "Xiao Hua, think about it, how can I not regret it? I have been acting seriously for thirty years as if it were the most important thing. But now, now I have fallen to this state! What have I gained? It is humiliation, it is ridicule! If I hadn't acted before, and planted a few trees with thirty years of time, now there would be a lot of fruits! You can start a family and build a career by doing anything, but only acting, the end of acting, is failure, is letting you become a madman!"</p>
<p>"Uncle Shi, don't think about these, just wait until you are well, and then sing again -- then no one will ridicule you anymore!" Lihua said soothingly. But turning her back, she secretly wiped away tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>"Sing again?" Shi Yulou smiled bitterly. "Who wants me anymore? Your godfather has already tried to find some theaters for me, but they all shook their heads and said: 'Golden Palace Feigning Madness' has become Golden Palace Real Madness, if he sings "Killing the Fishermen" tomorrow, he will come up with "Killing the Fishermen", wouldn't that shut down our theatre? This is not a joke." Hee hee! They all regard me as a madman! Madman! Hee hee... haha..."</p>
<p>"Uncle Shi!" Lihua called out to stop him. She almost couldn't help but cry!</p>
