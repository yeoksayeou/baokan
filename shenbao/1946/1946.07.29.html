<h3>國軍已採緊急戒備　共軍三路圍靖江　盱眙及甘泉鎮均收復</h3>

<h3>關於整軍問題　政府決本旣定方針　續與中共開誠商談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕半年來國共政治商談過程中之癥結問題頃據某權威人士語記者，自一月十日頒布停戰令後，政府方面始終遵行停戰，然共產黨則在一月十日以後繼續進佔大的城市，其間雖有六月七日之二度休戰令，惟共軍今置而不顧，並大肆進襲，政府每在不得已之情勢下，爲自衛計，方予以還擊。記者又詢以在蘇北各地進行之戰事，共產黨方面曾稱係爲肅淸僞軍，此說是否屬實，某氏答稱，請問共軍一度攻佔之泰興，眞有偽軍否，共產黨之作此言，顯爲製造進襲之藉口耳。旋記者再詢以關於蘇北共軍設若撤退後之行政權問題、共產黨曾稱可以人民選舉方式決定之，政府對此是否可能接受，某氏稱：目前撤兵問題，最困鄭者即在於此，因共方堅持保留行政權，故在停戰令後仍不斷進攻，其目的即在於每佔一城後，即改變其行政制度，使其範圍日有擴展，若謂在其撤退後施行人民選舉之政府，則試問在其攻佔之初，何不採取人民選舉之方式，讓人民決定其是否保留原有政府，抑或改變，故今日共產黨如退出各地區，則其地方行政權應恢復國軍撤退時之原態，易言之，即共產然實應撤退其行政權。某氏旋再稱，關於整編軍隊問題，原應自七月一日始，且其數量爲：政府軍第一期縮編爲九十個師，第二期縮編爲五十個師，共產黨則第一期應縮編爲十八個師，第二期縮編爲十個師，此項整編經過，須隨時公吿美方，然試觀今日政府方面（到處軍官大隊遍地編餘軍官）業已從原有之三百個師縮編成九十個師，而共產黨則迄今其番號及整編情形均未能予以公吿，此實爲共產黨不能實行政協決議之最大明證，至於所稱防區制，其實並無此名稱，乃爲一簡單之駐地問題，如今後共軍縮編為十八個師，其應駐有之地區，應爲若干，且能否與現有地區相配合，凡此自應有所商討。某民最後並稱，有若干人士所稱，目前各方正溯待主席頒發停戰令一事，其實停戰令並非政府單方所可頒發，而共產黨之肆意歪曲宣傳，對談判實一無益處、今後政府仍當在旣定之方針下，以最大詩意與之商談，保持靜定態度，不欲單方宣傳，亦不爲任何宣傳所動搖。</p>

<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿八日電〕遼瀋各地用電，向賴小豐滿水電廠供給，自蘇軍撤退，遂吿斷絕，迄未能對瀋恢輸電，董市長爲此問題，曾與來瀋之共方代表李敏然磋商兩次，業已擬有具體辦法，在共方控制下梅河口至南離木一段，長約百餘公里之輸電路，商定由政府派技術員工兩隊，自八月一日起自兩端開始對修，工程術員工之安全，由共方負完全責任，電路修通後，共軍負責保護，不再破壞。政府方面須供給哈爾濱·淸源·柳河·金川各地電流，哈爾濱之輸送電路，由雙方派員勘察各自區域內之電路，自負修理責任，俟一切修竣後，各地域同時恢復輸電，據估計，如電路破壞不鉅，兩週內或可修竣。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人的廬山生活儉樸清雅且不放棄工作</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺特派記者謝寶珠</p>
<p>差不多在每天早餐以後，中午時刻，和夕陽西下，華燈初上，在廬上雲霧縹渺中，如果你踏上那兩勞綠蔭叢叢，中隔泉流淙淙、富有詩意的建國路的時候，你常常會見到主席和夫人，有時還有馬歇爾夫人姗姗散步的倩影，或是乘轎出遊，或是遊罷歸來，或是在馬公館花園內乘涼的一幕。每次見到流露在夫人險上愉快的情緒，使我們更覺得這仙境的美麗，蔣夫人在山上的生活，可說是和主席同樣的儉樸清雅，但同樣地，她也沒有放棄工作。每天早晨七時左右，夫人必和主席一同起床作禱吿半小時，有時候如果夫人身體稍感不適，或睡眠不足，那末在作禱吿以後再休息一會。她的早餐也很簡單，普通是兩個鷄蛋，一兩片土司，一些水果和一杯可可，夫人是不大愛吃牛奶的。和主席有着同樣的習慣、就是在早餐時必須看報，早點後或和主席一起在附近散步，或到對門和馬夫人下棋。然後進她私人的辦公室，處理有關婦女界各種要公。平時逢到英文公事，就由夫人親自撰擬文件，交秘書陳純廉女士整理打字，如果是中文公事，就由一位劉同縝秘書辦理。這次因爲山上公務稍暇，僅來了陳女士一位。除了料理公事外，夫人還常常寫作，著作品多數寄往國外發表。</p>
<p>十一時左右，夫人往往到花園內親自監督圍丁佈置花木。夫人對鮮花的愛好，眞是無以復加、無論走過什麽園子，如果看見美麗可愛的花朶，她一定要駐足欣賞一番，要如能設法帶一點　　的話，必定歡喜萬分。而她尤其注意插花的藝術，她絕對不喜歡把一扎花呆板板的塞在瓶內，因此公館內所有的花，都是由一個具有美術天才的侍從所佈置的。</p>
<p>有時候，夫人就利用這時間（十一時以後）見客，常被召見的，有黄總幹事仁霖，皮參軍宗敢，還有婦女界方面的代表等，美駐天津總領事施麥斯夫婦也是她的坐上客。可是，來到山上以後，夫人最親近的朋友就要算是馬歇爾夫人了。夫人對馬夫人招待之週到和懇切，眞是不可多見，不但把自己身邊的西菜大司務到她那裏給她作菜，而且差不多每天中午都到馬公館陪馬夫人午餐。夫人吃西菜的時候，比較多些，她頂不愛吃腺氣太重的菜肴。晚餐時主席除了吃二個半碗的飯外，有時也吃些稀飯，但夫人並不怎樣愛吃稀飯。夫人平時總喝淸茶，同時茶中必放黛黛花二朶。除了請客時的必需外，她也不常喝酒。有時，她在中午會到名勝地去野餐。</p>
<p>中餐以後，她並不一定每天都要午睡，有時和馬夫人兩人談談天，下下棋，或在街上逛逛。上街時候，很喜歡看看商店櫉窗內擺的物品，問問價錢。誰都知道夫人的衣着用品是不會比任何一個太太小姐們缺少的，可是大概很少人知道她節儉的程度，甚至一雙絲襪破了，也得補一補再穿。公館內上上下下的開支，都必須經過她的尤許後方可辦理。</p>
<p>當她走在街上時，不論貧富小孩，她必定上前去拍拍他們的肩膀，摸摸他們的頭，問他們姓作麼，呌什麼，那裏人，幾歲等等。看見他們一身骯髒時，就呌他們回去洗乾凈，夫人慈愛的心腸，由此可見。散步的時候，逢到鄕下人田裏種着的新鮮玉蜀黍之類的東西，常會使隨從人員買些帶回家去。</p>
<p>下午到傍晚，有時會客，有時參加集會，如果生席接見外賓時，就由她担任翻譯。晚飯前，再和主席或馬夫人出外散步。爲了馬夫人一人在此非常寂寞，晚飯總是由夫人請她來邸同進，要是主席有生客需要在席間談談的話，夫人就和馬夫人另行進餐。</p>
<p>晚餐後，假如天晴，月光高照時，或在宅外，或在花園內漫步片刻。夫人愛好音樂，公館內鋼鋼琴一架，夫人興緻好時，就自己奏上一曲。無綫電內的音樂也常收聽。到十一時左右安寢，睡前還要入辦公室工作一些時候。</p>
<p>夫人在山上所穿的服裝，有時是長旗袍，有時穿西裝褲。夏天比較喜歡的顏色是淡綠色或藍白花樣，上山後很少穿高跟鞋，散步時都已經換上半高跟的了。（七月二十五日寄自廬山）</p>
<h3>美大使因勞致疾　馬歇爾等昨曾親往探訪</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿八日電〕司徒雷登大使廿七日上山後，即感不適，但仍與馬帥三度會談，並擬將談話結果呈告主席。據有關方面稱：大使在京與周恩來之會談，並無新發展，周氏僅向司徒大使報吿昆明事件，欲取得司徒大使之同情，並未談及政治問題，大使對李聞二氏之慘死，甚表悼惜。（圖為司徒大使抵牯嶺嵵本報記者謝寶珠攝影）</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿八日電〕司徒雷登大使抵牯後，因旅途勞頓，略感疲乏，廿八日在旅邸休息，下午四時稍覺畏寒發熱，馬歇爾及蔣夢麟均往探訪，並由國府侍衛醫官爲其診斷，發覺大使體溫略高，大使原定廿八晚七時與蔣主席同進晚餐，亦因不適，未能赴約。據隨大使來牯之顧問傅涇波吿記者，大使因拜新命以來，工作甚忙，即以在京接見賓客而論，每日常在八十人以上，兼之僕僕京牯道上，尤可見其辛勞，休養數日後，即可康復。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>祝歐洲和會成功！</h3>
<p>歐洲和平會議，今天在巴黎盧森堡宮開幕，到廿一國代表，由法國內閣總理兼外長致開會辭，我國外長王世杰及駐外使節，亦前往參加。這是戰後第一次和平會議，其主旨在收拾戰後歐洲的殘局。全世界喁喁望治的人士，莫不以愉快的心情，對於這次歐洲和會，表示深切的期望。這次和會的最大任務，乃在簽字對義·芬·羅·匈·保五國媾和條約，使戰亂已久的歐洲，一部份能早日獲得平靜的歸趨。所以，這次和會的意義重大，決非尋常國際會議所可比擬。美國國務卿貝爾納斯在華府乘坐專機飛往巴黎之際，杜魯門總統特別為其舉行送別式，預祝這次和會成功，并殷勤叮囑：「美國全國人民決以全力擁護基於大西洋憲章及聯合國憲章之公允合理的和平」，這使貝爾納斯出席和會討論歐洲問題，不僅有了一個可以恪守的最高原則，而且將來與他國代表發生爭議時，也有了一個可靠的後盾。</p>
<p>從納粹德國無條件投降之日起，歐洲戰事即告終了，迄今已一年有餘。在此期間，各國的政治外交家，雖曾竭智盡能，一再召集國際會議，如波茨坦三巨頭會議，倫敦五國外長會議，莫斯科三國外長會議，巴黎四國外長會議等等，無非欲使戰後的歐洲各國得早日恢復平時的正常狀態，一般身受戰禍洗刧的人民，也可以早些出水火而登袵席。但是，波瀾迭起，舌敝唇焦，經過一年多的努力，始能召開這次歐洲和會。締造世界和平的艱難，實在不下於戰時的爭取勝利。</p>
<p>今天展望歐洲和會的前途，我們不能因為締造和平之不易，而就不敢樂觀。天下事得來越艱難，纔越可覺得寶貴。我們相信人類的良知，對於爭取和平，必能克服種種難關而獲得最後的成功。戰後世界各國的人民，在大難之餘，痛定思痛，喁喁望治，真可說是人同此心，心同此理。只要世界上沒有再像希特勒·墨索里尼·東條之流，大發其「主宰世界」的神經病，則我們敢說世界戰禍，不致再起，永久和平必有實現的一天，此際實在沒有「灰心」和「失望」的理由。只要人人有決心，人人有正義感，對於這次和會，「只許成功，不許失敗」，則此次和會的結果，一定會替歐洲播種下許多和平的種子，對於整個的世界和平，也必能有相當的貢獻。</p>
<p>然而，締造和平是大家共同的目的，如何達到和平的目的，却有不可或少的先決條件：</p>
<p>第一，締造世界和平，應採民主的方法，因為戰後世界各國的人民，莫不期望戰後的世界能步入和平民主的新時代，且一致公認，國際的民主一天不能實現，則眞正的世界和平即一天不能締成。翻閱近代歷史，國際戰爭的爆發，無一次不是國際強權政治的惡果。而默察最近一年來國與國之間，依然只有「力」的再平衡，一切問題均取決於「力」的因素。英美與蘇聯互相爭霸，尤其是蘇聯與美國各有其主觀的世界政策，而英國則依違於兩者之間，希望在「力」的再平衡中保持其舉足重輕的強國態勢。此次歐洲和會，也許就是強權政治大獻神通的絕好機會。如果這種作風不能改變，大家只認識「力」而忽略了「理」，依然認為「力即是理」，心目中祗把和會作為請客式的宴會，一切問題都取決於少數的強國手裹，甚至連議程也不讓大家商討來決定，而一般弱國小國的代表，不過藉此機會到巴黎觀光跳舞或出席酒會茶會，則和會的前途恐未必就能副世人的期望。要實現國際的民主原則，我們以為那少數控制多數的「否決權」，為免得濫用起見，更有撤消的必要。</p>
<p>第二，和會討論任何問題，各國代表發表意見，均應以國際正義為準繩，不存絲毫報復的惡劣心理，然後可以謀得合理公允的解決。唯有如此，自然一勞永逸。否則只求目前，不顧將來；或只求自己痛快，不想人家受不了；或只知暫時妥協，就不惜拋棄原則，這都不是澈底根本的辦法，更不能為人類和平建立百年大計。杜魯門總統說，美國擁護基於兩大憲章的公允和平，這句話含義深長，値得出席和會的廿一國代表共同三思。第一次世界大戰後的和約，就是我們的前車之鑒。</p>
<p>要之，締造世界和平，固然不易，但積聚人類的共同努力，必能成功。這次和會的召開，就是走向和平又進一步。我們應以愉快的心情來預祝和會成功，同時並堅持以國際民主與正義為締造和平的最高原則，籲請各國代表一致信守，使這個世界眞能步入和平民主的新時代。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英外相貝文因政躬違和，不能赴巴黎出席和會開幕典禮，當改由艾德禮首相親自前往，其他出席代表爲海相亞歷山大·外次麥克尼爾·財部財政秘書霍爾。貝文遵醫囑，至少須休息一星期，在首相缺席期間，由樞密院長莫理遜代行首相職務。據本社外交記者稱，巴黎和會開幕階段內，或不致發生需要貝文之特殊經騐之問題。五國和約大致均已議妥，英國態度亦早已有明晰之表示，惟德奧及巴勒斯坦問題，或當同時在會外討論，而於討論德國問題時，貝文之豐富經騐，似尤不可缺少。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕英外部發言人今日聲稱，外次會議已決定不發表對義·芬·保·羅·匈五國和約全文，推測其故，必爲美英蘇法對「何者應予公佈，何者不應公佈，未能商獲同意」。按和約全文中已經四國同意各部份，昨日交予報界，約定今日午後十一時發表，是項許可，現已撤消。</p>
<h3>願各國推誠相見奠定全世界和平　貝爾納斯臨行發表宣言</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕國務鄕貝爾納斯本日午後啓程赴巴黎前，在飛機塲向歡迎之二千羣衆致辭，申言美國決不回復孤立政策。渠稱，今日局勢已與第一次大戰結束時完全不同，我國內部已不再見政府各部之衝突情形，所見者爲同心協力一致工作之狀况。世界不能信賴分裂狀態下美國，余希望此次和會結束時，即能簽訂第一組之和約。和平必須發自人類之內心，始能有效。杜魯門總統祝貝氐此去成功，並吿以美國決爲聯合國後盾，期建立以大西洋憲章及聯合國憲章爲基礎之和平。英法大使亦在機塲歡送貝爾納斯。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕參院外委會主席康納利廣播宣讀國務卿貝爾納　參加巴黎和會前之宣言，表示美國決使此次和會，成爲和平努力之開端，決不使成爲和平工作之末頁。復謂避免恐怖新戰爭之希望，繫於是否能消除戰後所遺下之摩擦原因。其言有謂，經數月之努力後，余覺吾人已步入和平之途。在各國以妬忌之心理，力保其主權之世界上，實無眞正之和平製造程序，製造和平必須覓取妥協，目前所獲之進展，亦爲妥協之結果。在完成任務以前，猶須繼續妥協，但此所謂妥協者，係指調和誠實之意見衝突而言，並非爲本身或他人獲取自私之利益。今茲吾人不但應協助製造和平，且當使其成有效之和平，吾人當與各國合作，建立和平，發展和平。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿七日電〕澳外長即出席和會代表團團長伊瓦特，頃自紐約行抵英國南亞普頓城，發表談話稱，澳洲代表團之目標，乃在獲得一合理的民主的和平，並須確定締造和平應採取民主的方法，不僅以巴黎和會爲限。其後對德奧日三國關係，亦應採取民主的方法，澳洲代表將竭智盡能，以盡其對於和平之貢獻，俾能與渙洲海陸空三軍在此次大戰各戰區所表現之功績，等量齊觀。澳洲與英國因有「同王同種」，不可分離之關係，相依爲命，在第一第二兩次世界大戰中，業獲得充分表現。職是之故，吾人對於歐洲問題，實有直接利害關係。要而言之，澳洲基於正義與民主，獲得一勞永逸之解決，主要利益因應在太平洋，但因澳洲又爲英國構成之一份子，永遠不能置身歐洲之外。</p>
<h3>鄭大使抵英履新　促進中英邦交為己任</h3>

<h3>大會議程</h3>
<p>首先討論對義和約</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕紐約時報今日載巴黎電稱，義大利和約或於大會議程中列爲第一案，此約可以證明四國外長在許多要點雖已獲得同意，而於其他各點則並未一致，或尚待決定，將請和會指示。約文之內容，決然爲一草案而非條約。四強對於義邊界已大體協定，但尚另有提議，如　　提出之義大利與南斯拉夫邊界綫，及義大利奧特里埃斯特自由領導。義大利對蘇聯之賠償雖經四張同意，但對法國·希臘·南斯拉夫·阿　巴尼亞及阿比西尼亞應給與何種賠償，則未議定。特港雖同意由國際管理，但其政府之地位如何，並未決定，對於北非及東非之義殖民地雖同意展緩一年決定，但其解決方式，在草約中顯未聲明。</p>
<h3>國際法庭日辯護律師　擬提出密電一件　證明羅斯福早知決裂</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿八日電〕合衆社記者今日獨得消息：此間審判日本戰犯期間，日辯護律師方面可能運用日本秘密電報一件，以謀證明故羅斯福總統及前國務鄕赫爾早在一九四一年十一月廿八日，即知日本已確定使和平談判趨於破裂。此項消息，係由某辯護律師單獨向合衆社露透，但不願宣佈其名字。辯護律師方面所以有此計劃，目的乃在證明美國高級官吏對於日攻擊珠港一點，不應大驚小怪。此人並謂：美軍官曾截獲日本於一九四一年十一月廿八日自東京發往華盛頓之密碼電報，並加以譯出，其中日政府方面吿派往華府之「和平使節」稱：談判將於二三日內破裂。據云此項電報係於截獲之後當日譯出。苟此一電訊曾予以運用，則必然用作防禦工作之基礎，因美日兩國均知戰爭即將來臨，而羅斯福及赫爾佯作不知，使日本首先採取此一行動。合衆社記者復探悉：此項電報曾對日本派往華府谷代表爲獲致和平而作之「超人努力」表示欽佩；但指出美國之反建議對日過份屈辱，故不能予以接受。日本派往華府之外交代表自此一電訊中得悉，彼等不久即將接到帝國政府對於美建議之見解，日期爲二三日，談判至此，事實上將吿破裂。據稱：該電文曾謂，此種局勢乃無可避免者，但在官方照會到達之前，警吿各代表不能造成談判已吿破裂之印象。</p>

<h3>老懷悲愴　大聲疾呼　袁希洛絕食三日　提倡節食救濟蘇北難胞　並擬飛延安作最後諍諫</h3>
<p>蘇省耆紳，敎育界前輩袁希洛，最近赴鎭江出席救濟蘇北難民募捐會議，並參觀難民救濟所歸來後、老懷悲愴，決絕食三日，以此三日之食，捐救蘇北難胞，並向江南各縣父老呼籲，請抱已飢已溺之懷，踴躍捐救，同時致電毛澤東·朱德兩氏，懇以民命爲重，民意爲歸，迅即撤退蘇北共軍，俾琉亡同胞得早日返鄉，並擬於日內商借飛機逕飛延安，以絕食作最後諍諫，茲將袁氏親筆函電兩通，原文錄後：</p>
<p>致電朱毛請速撤兵</p>
<p>上海中央社各報館轉延安毛澤東先生朱德先生均鑒，去歲十一月微日，希洛與上海父老十四人聯名通電，勸國共兩方息兵爭、且以貴軍破壞鐵路，致使物資不能交流，其爲患將使人民不得衣食，凍餓而死，擬乘飛機飛涎安，以絕食勸阻貴軍勿破壞鐵路。蔣主席以洛年老，不允派飛機送我去延安，故朱成行，去今已達八閱月矣。國共談判協商迄未成功，衝突不已，我蘇省江北三十一縣市，兩千萬人民，在抗戰期間，備受敵僞之蹂躪，水深火熱，痛苦已達極點。勝利以後，十一個月來，又受貴黨軍政人員厲行「鬥爭」「坦白」徴集壯丁，以供黨爭、至戶戶家破，人人自危。數月以來，避難流亡徐·海·通·泰·揚·鎭·京·滬及江南各地者，達數百萬人。希洛前日赴鎭江，曾至此等難民救濟所參觀，雖有政府及好善人士，捐貲救濟，但百萬流亡，日需食米萬石，又豈能爲力，故難民所無異人間地獄，人人骨瘦如柴，衣不掩體，一有疾病，無資醫治，每至死亡，慘不忍睹，現決定不食三日，以所食之費捐救難民，並通吿蘇南各縣市人士，勸其贊同此舉，各不食一日，以此食救濟流亡難民，爲此電懇兩先生，從速將蘇北貴軍撤退，俾流亡之數百萬同胞，得在秋間，回返鄕井，不致凍餓而死，勿使民怨日深，貴黨終爲國民所棄。現在武器日精，世界已入原子時代，如逞兵以禍國，必致亡國而滅種。國民黨與中國共產黨，皆係炎黄子孫，同爲一祖之兄弟，若以兵爭地方，使人民或則被砲火而死，或則流離各地，窮餓而死，實爲骨肉相殘。本年二月間，希洛曾寫孔子　運大同一節，交周恩來先生送致兩先生，請先生雅誦，此爲中國聖人公天下救人類之金玉良言，望先生奉此主義，與全國人民共救中國，共救世界。希洛擬在日內商借飛機，飛延安，以絕食與兩先生周旋，先此電達，袁希洛感代電。</p>
<p>呼籲父老廣大同情</p>
<p>江蘇省江南各縣父老兄弟暨京滬兩市父老兄弟均鑒，希洛在七月二十日赴鎭江，二十一日下午出席救濟蘇北難民募捐會議，幷參觀難民救濟所，聽難民代表之報吿，覺蘇北人民爲共產軍政人士之非常舉動，家產已盡，生命不保，不能不離鄕背井，向徐州南通鎭江及蘇寗上海一帶避難，在難民救濟所者，救濟米麵，需量鉅大，一百二十萬人，一日須有米六千石，或麵粉六十萬斤，雖由政府撥濟，及社會熱心人士之捐助，數量時感不足，故救濟所無異人間地獄，難民骨瘦如柴，衣服更感不足，幸在暑天，尚不至凍死，然小孩則儘可赤身，大人不能不遮蔽其下體，故以破爛之棉夾襖褲遮體，無一較完好之夏衣，若有疾病，更乏醫藥之資，祇好聽其死亡。現在難民有姓名經調查所得之數，爲徐州六十萬人，此中有山東河南逃來者，鎭江及京滬綫各市縣爲五十萬人，南通十萬人，其他不在避難所而寄居於親友，及賃屋而居，散在鄕間求乞度日者，约在三百萬人以上。希洛目擊耳聞，對此避共難之同胞，實覺傷心已極，憶去年十一月五日，爲共產黨軍阻止國軍奉政府命令接收失地，解除投降日軍武裝，將鐵路破壞，恐不但國軍不能接收失地，且使物炎不能交流，至使人民餓死，與上海父老十四人，通電重慶延安，勸止國共內爭。希洛“電老友吳稚暉先生，請蔣主席派飛機來上海，載我赴延安，以絕食勸阻毛澤東朱德兩先生之非常舉動，吳稚老不贊同我絕食之舉，不派飛機來，致未能實現我在延安絕食之舉。現在希洛決定三日不食，以此三日之食，捐救蘇北避難同胞。希洛敬求我蘇南各縣京滬兩市父老兄弟姊妹，贊成此舉，皆不食一日，以此一日之食，救濟蘇北避難同胞。此一日食品，可折成現款，交附近銀行，匯交銀江蘇北難民救濟協會，此等功德將百倍於燒香念佛也。此上謹頌善安。七十一老人袁希洛謹啓，七月二十六日。</p>
<h3>蘇北難民協會救濟流亡學生</h3>
<p>蘇北難民救濟協會上海辦事處，二十六日召開救濟流亡靑年會議，通過重要議案四項：（一）救濟學生款項，發放程序，決由校方查明蘇北籍之某班級學生造具名册三份，並推代表一人，會同有關機關人員監發，學生亦須推代表一人，幫同辦理領發事項，其於領款時，必須携帶學生證及圖章等，按照規定手續辦理，學生受款用途，以維持伙食爲限，其款彙交伙食房或銀行者，悉由校方處理（二）救濟學生款項數字，在暑期內，每月每名學生，發給補助費兩萬元，以維持伙食爲主。（三）學生遇有疾病之醫藥等費，由辦事處負責設法辦理。（四）組設「蘇北難民救濟協會上海辦事處學生臨時救濟委員會」，辦理今後救濟學生事項。公推：胡審徵，符海秋、陸鐵乘等十三人為委員，以陸鐵乘為召集人，該會必要辦公費用，由辦事處籌撥。</p>
<h3>全市薪給收入者能否捐一日所得</h3>
<p>蘇北難民救濟協會上海市籌募委員會，昨接熱心人士來函，提議籲請全市公務員，及其他薪給收入之同胞們，捐助一日所得，（凡有額定每月收入者皆屬之）據統計該項薪給收入，當在一百萬人左右，每人一日所得平均最少三千元，總數則達卅億以上。該會對此項提議，正在考慮中。</p>

<h3>濟部長在招待會中　勉歸國技術人員　應體認國內困難準備應付　將寶貴經驗用以協助復員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部長王雲五，與次長備錚，潘序倫等，昨日下午三時，假銀行俱樂部舉行茶會，招待經濟部遣送赴美實習歸國第一批技術人員共一百十四人。經濟部蘇浙皖特派員張茲間，及主任秘書郭可說等，亦列席參加。首由王部長致詞，略稱：今日能與諸位舉行茶話會，殊感欣幸。諸位期定一年，學成回國，原擬參予各項戰時生產工作。茲者我國業已抗戰勝利，諸位回國後，將參予戰後復興工作。此次勝利之突然光降，殊使萬民欣感然勝利前我國對戰後各項復員工作。準備不够充份，故勝利後，頗多不協調之現象。單以工業而言，其不景氣情况，似尤甚於戰時，然此爲由戰時步入和平一階段所不可避免之現象。蓋由和平步入戰時，一般心理都趨向克苦耐勞，故一切困難，本不易解決，亦能迎刃而解。然由戰時步入和平則不然，一般心理均趨於過份樂觀之途。遂使本來應加倍努力應付付之復員工作，忽吿鬆懈，故失望亦爲意料中事，可不必因此而悲觀。諸位在國外實習一年，熟習國外工業設施情形，驟然歸國，或覺國內工業之一切設施，均不協調，致不能將所學和盤托出。然諸位在出國前，已多在工業界服務有年，當與普通留學生不同，切望勿視事過於簡便，免致偶遭挫折，即感失望。故現在期望於諸位者有二點：（一）深望諸位要體認我國國內種種困難，先研究困難之底細、準備應付困難，才不致感到失望。（二）諸位在國外實習一年，正看到美國工業由戰時步入和平時期。美國對戰後復員工作，早有準備，且富於經騐。听以希望諸位把這些</p>
<p>寶貴經驗　配合國情</p>
<p>施行到我國的復員工作上來。至於諸位回國後的服務問題，在此復員時期，各機關需要技術人員孔殷之時，當能各得其所，各盡所長。茲查此次派遣人員中，依實習科目言，共分九組。希望每組都推一代表，報吿此次出國實習經過。旋由次長蕭錚起立致詞，略稱：願補充適才王部長之意見，略陳數語。期望各位，爲建設中國成一富强國家而努力。我國過去爲一經濟被侵略之國家。此次戰後，由次殖民地一躍而爲世界一等强國。茲姑撇開此次戰塲之勝利與否不談，實際之經濟工業勝利，都未獲得。八年抗戰敎訓所昭示於吾人者，即我國如圖富强，非努力於經濟工業基礎之建設不爲功。試觀英美諸國，經濟有基礎，工業有地位，惟經過一次戰爭磨折，尚須經過相當時期，方能復員完成。而我國</p>
<p>經濟基礎　向來脆弱</p>
<p>復員工作當非一朝一夕所能完成。故中央在勝利前，已議就五年復興計劃，期以最迅捷的時間，建設我國之經濟力量。此計劃未曾全部公諸社會，不過爲一初步之計劃，替我國定好經濟的路綫。諸位分九組出國實習，都是配合此計劃之需要。此計劃建設的基礎有二：（一）建設全國交通，（二）建設基本工業。此二部門如吿完成，即能陸續談到其他輕工業之發展。然就此二部而言，已需幾萬個專門人材。政府因鑒於過去留學制度放任之弊端，故諸位出國，均係根據此五年計劃而派遺者。故希望：（一）如何有計劃把諸位配合於原定之計劃下，出而服務。使諸位能各　所長，爲國效勞。（二）希望諸位本織家遣送之初意，在整個國家之前提下，堅守各自崗位努力。配合國家之需要，以完成此建設計劃。晚近各國經濟制度，已從自由主義趨於計劃經濟之途。英美各國咸感有以政治及國家的力量，以協助一國經濟建設之必要。我國經濟制度，以民生主義爲中心，對經濟建設，亦係從有組織·有計劃之途邁進。故國營與民營事業，不致有競爭，而應有相互配合之發展。深望諸位能本此原則，共同配合努力，則我國經濟之發展，始有厚望。綱由　　學員代表　黃振勳氏</p>
<p>致答詞，黄氏首代表各學員向王部長及蕭潘兩次長茶會招待盛意致謝。並稱：此次回國後，有諸位長官指導，當不致徬徨莫措。若輩此次出國，頗感我國人員之智慧，並不下於外人。惟美國工人，大多領導有方，管理嚴密，，且生活極爲安定，故能安心工作。亟望政府對此次學成回國工作之各人員，應使生活安定，則各人員當然盡最大之努力，協助國家建設云。</p>
<p>最後由電力組蔡家鯉，機械組馮子佩，電機組孟希潛，民生組化工組烏統昭，管理組王量，紡織組蘇先劼，煉油粗盧元鎔等分別報吿各該組出國實習經過。茲擇其犖犖大者，摘錄如後：美國各工廠之優點：（一）分工精細，合作週密，組織靈活，而易於配合運用。（二）人事制度，極有規則。（三）生產控制，極爲完善。（四）管理技術，頗具歷史。（五）生產成本，極受注意。（六）工資頗爲低廉，例如棉紡工人工資，每小時爲七角，生活極爲安定。（七）工人敎育及智識，日見改進。除上述優點外，各員所感苦悶者，即有若干大型工廠，因產品性質、及對外貿易關係，頗有不願公開者。並希望此後政府派遣人員出國留學，各方面均應配合齊全云。</p>

<h3>潘公展李石曾等聯名呈請　定八月八日為父親節　凡屬子女是日均應分偑紅白花紀念</h3>

<p>謹呈者：竊以上海各界領袖，顏惠慶，袁希濂，史致富，梅蘭芳，費穆，張一渠，陳靑士，陸幹臣，嚴獨鶴，富文壽等十人，於民國三十四年八月八日，發起父親節，並發表緣起云：「憶昔第一次歐戰吿終時，美國笳維絲女士，發起母親節、旨在慰陣亡者之母，嗣世界各國有職之士，積極推行，轉而爲紀念本身之母</p>
<p>地無中外時無古今錫類之思，蓋無二致。然父以生我，母以鞠我，張横渠銘父乾母坤之恩，劉梅簫詰父憂母難之德，惟父惟母，並稱並重。知有父而不知有母，固失人情之常，知有母而不知有父，寗非痛心之事！同人等値茲第二次歐戰結束之際，聯想及此，爰聯名發起父親節，定每年八月八日，敬謹舉行，故亦稱八八節。</p>

<h3>介紹杭州新羣中學　歸來勝利弦歌續　無恙湖山好讀書</h3>
<p>「黄梅睜節家家雨」，在這勝利後第一次暑假，青年學子們都帶着一顆輕鬆的心，準備回家去舒暢地消度這一段長長的夏日。但是正届畢業的學生，也許爲了升學問題，心裏有些徬徨。自己究竟應該進那個學校呢？這裏筆者願將本年秋季在杭州復課的新羣高級中學給讀者們作一個簡單的報導。</p>
<p>創辦小史</p>
<p>新舉高中，創辦於民國廿九年。那時因爲戰爭的烽火，使浙西原有中學，都受了極大的打擊，一時難以全部恢復。而陷區靑年，懷着熱烈的心情來到內地，却苦無求學之所。浙江省民政應廳長阮毅成先生等，便在那時發起籌設新羣高中。幾經策劃，纔於那年秋季，在當時的浙江臨時省會永康柿后，正式開課。這一所中學開辦以後，對陷區學生特予救濟，敎課也很認眞，因此頗得社會好評。到了三十一年夏季，已有班級六級，學生三百餘人·不幸那年戰局急轉，浙東各地多遭蹂躪。新羣在一個月之中，後遷六百里，沿途所遭艱困，一言難盡。所有設備，除圖書外，全部損失，因此暫吿停課。原有學生，分別介紹，轉入省立學校續學。</p>
<p>復校經過</p>
<p>去年抗戰勝利之後，新羣校董會，即派員到杭州，籌備復校，暫借雷峯塔七號爲校舍。雷峯塔爲杭州名勝之一，面湖背山，風景秀麗，距湖濱只三華里，水陸交通，均可直達。而且「雷峯之遺跡宛然，南　之鐘聲不絕，花木扶疏，庭園寬廣，」實爲讀書佳境。原有房屋，爲了曾經迭駐敵偽軍隊，多遭破壞，校董會即撥巨款，加以修復，大致已復舊觀。圖書部份，現有一萬五千册，仍在繼續多方搜購中。理化生物儀　標本，已照美國中等學校設備標準，向美國定購，計已付款一千六百餘萬元，大約本年十月底，可運抵上海。</p>

<h3>外貨傾注·燃料缺乏　水泥工業岌岌可危　進口水泥每包祇售五千元存煤將罄配售煤寥寥無幾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在外貨水泥傾銷之下，國產水泥工業已瀕于即將破產之境地、據海關方面可靠統計，自本年一月起至六月止，洋貨水泥進口的達五十餘萬包，每包五十公斤之市價以國幣五千元計，半年來外流資金達二十五萬萬元之巨。國產廠商上海水泥公司中國水泥公司　新水泥公司及資源委員會新近成立之台灣水泥公司等爲挽救常前危機起見，已於最近組織中華水泥工業聯合會，商討辦法。昨據該會秘書奚正修氏語記者，第一步擬先呈請政府提高洋貨水泥之進口稅。蓋目前國產水泥由於工資及原料燃料等運輸費用之昂貴，每包六十餘公斤之成太的需九千餘元，而外貨每包五十公斤之市價僅爲五千元爲挽回國家利權計，祇得忍痛以每包六千元之代價出售，但長此以往，何堪虧蝕？勢將有被迫停工之一天，現成本方而由於種種因素旣無法可以減低，則惟有希望政府提高進口關稅以謀補救。其次，水泥爲國防上建築上極需要之材料，戰前我國水泥工業已有極佳之成績，如上海永泥公司之象牌，中國水泥公司之泰山牌，啓新公司之馬牌等，其品質甚至超越洋貨，故國內各界極爲樂用。但勝利以來，迷信洋貨之風氣又趨濃厚，甚且政府機關亦然，　之至堪痛心，故擬呈請政府設法獎勵國民採用國貨。再則燃料煤斤之來源極感困難，以上海水泥公司而論，月需煤斤約四千噸，而燃料支配委員會所能供給者僅百噸左右，現所賴以維持者尚係接收所得，日方留下之煤，但即將用罄，故關於此點亦須亟謀解决云。</p>

<h3>怎樣消滅高利貸？</h3>
<p>— 雙紅</p>
<p>的確，助長投機擾亂金融的高利貸，已成爲當今最普遍而又無法取締的一個嚴重問題了！輿論界屢次有義正詞嚴的文章評盤過，財政當局也非常注意，查禁所謂「地下錢莊」和「貼票公司」。但高利貸終於沒有消滅！</p>
<p>高利貸果眞是無法取締嗎？這也並不。但是倘使把各地工商業實際的經濟狀况，和當地的金融機構來綜合的檢討一下，我們就可知道，如果要打倒高利貸，決不是用查禁或取締的方法就會生效的，我們要硏究怎樣）用別的方式來使這高利貸自然的消戚。</p>
<p>在硏討怎樣來消滅高利貸之前，我們得先來硏究這高利貸是如何會普遍到造成今天的局面。</p>
<p>從前的所謂高利貸，就是放印子錢，而借這印子錢的人，大多數是連當當頭也沒有東西的窮人們，才來幹這飲酖止渴的勾當，普通的工廠和商店自有銀行錢莊可以往來，絕對不需要借印子錢，反之，放印子錢的人，也決沒有偌大的資余來供給普遍的工業百業的，所以從前的所謂高利貸，——印子錢——是僅僅是社會的最黑暗底層的一小角落的事，決不會影響到助長投機，擾亂金融。</p>
<p>自從淪陷之後，由於僞幣一天一天的儘量濫發，物價便一天一天的拼命在漲，一般人的心理，惟有囤貨可以發財，於是不惜出了重利借了錢來囤貨。自然，有求必有供，銀行錢莊推說頭寸緊，一天一天的把利息抬高，以致造成比印子錢還高的高利貸。但是結果眞寃枉，淪陷八年之中，放利息的人與囤貨的人比起來，據說還是放利息的人吃了大虧。</p>
<p>勝利以來，大家的心理以爲一切都改觀了，決沒有這樣的怪現狀了，誰知第一記生活，就是二百作一，再繼之各收復區銀行錢莊一律停業淸理，旣不准復業，又不許新設。</p>
<p>二百作一所造成的果是很明顯的物價普遍的刺激着上漲，於是一般商人們囤虎們，還是忘不了囤積貨物，還是不惜出了重利把借來的錢囤貨。</p>
<p>收復區銀行錢莊一律停業後，旣不准復業，許多的行莊從業員，一無出路，於是集合了少數資本，放放利息，運也是原因之一，而最大的問題還是國家銀行不能普遍的調劑工商業，小工廠小商店需要金融周轉的臨時小額借款，感到不得其門而入，除了向所謂貼票公司臨時移借之外，竟是吿貸無門！</p>
<p>另一方面是省市縣銀行的存息太低，如果有人信仰法幣，規規矩矩不做投機，不囤貨物，把現金存進銀行裏去收些週息幾機或週息一分的利息，在當今的生活程度之下，是決沒有運種呆鳥的，因爲這個緣故，無論公務人員，商店小職員，甚至婦人女子，都知道一個出路，如果不囤貨物，那末所有的餘資只有存進貼票公司去收些高利，這一來，無形中就增加了貼票公司的實力。</p>
<p>高利貸的會造成今天普遍到如此的局面，不外乎上述的幾種緣由，我們根據了這緣由，就很容易的得到了怎樣消滅高利貸的辦法。</p>
<p>（一）嚴防官僚資本衝入奸商隊裏投機操縱，（二）切實抑平物價，（三）提高銀行存息，（四）迅速開放各地新設銀行錢莊。</p>
<p>總之，高利貸決不是單方面的事，有借始有放，如果沒有需要，那高利貸就無用武之地，關於（一）（二）兩點，是有連帶關係　，沒有官僚資本從中作祟，我們相信抑平物價，是容易見效的，物價穩定之後，試問誰還願意去囤貨，更談不到借了高利貸去囤貨，（三）提高了銀行存息，可使游資納入正軌，減少投機性，至少可以使一般小職員和婦人們，不致盲目的存入貼票公司，（四）如果各地開放新設銀行錢莊，使一般工商業普遍的得到金融的調劑，那末誰運願意向貼票公司去借高利貸呢？</p>
<p>二百作一的事，已經過去了，我們希望財政當局趕快來幹猶可挽救的事！不要再緊閉着新設行莊的門，使工商業吿貸無門，逼到向貼票公司去借高利貸，而目前的一般情形，可說是除了上海以外，各省市縣鎭的金融活動權威，竟操在貼票公司手裹，這並不是筆者過分誇大其詞，普遍的事實是如此，希望財政當局再不要用官樣文章的方式，僅僅來查禁或取締，這是在事實上可說決沒有效的，我們急切地期望着財政當局採納我們的意見，不要說「何不食肉糜」隔靴搔癢之類的話，而要實地來俯察民間工商百業的需要是什麽？眞實地來救救弱小工商各業！這方才是消滅高利貸的治本辦法。</p>

<h3>「白象國」暴風雨之一幕　暹羅王猝斃前後</h3>
<p>— 曼谷十一日航訊　潔蓀寄</p>
<p>暹羅自鑾巴立（即乃比里）重任總理，人皆岌岌於獨裁政治之勢將復活。國會舉行大選，社尼巴莫及乃寬領導之民主黨宣吿失敗，鑾巴立之憲法黨獲得勝利，鑾披汶時代之人物，幾皆全部重登政治舞台，獨裁色彩，更見濃厚。第八世王馬希道爾（即亞南他瑪希倫）自幼求學歐陸，沾染歐美思想，歸國之後，常與社尼巴莫及乃寬有所往還，對華，對美，皆表好感，早遭獨裁者之忌。此次暴崩，舉世注目，暹羅民衆，尤多疑慮；國會議員亦曾一再提出質問。民衆及議員，因此被捕者，爲數至爲不少。鑾巴立政府雖然加以種種掩飾，且任用鑾亞倫爲陸軍總司令，以資彈壓。</p>
<p>綜合民間議論，類皆不承認故王之死，係出意外。較爲敢言之暹文報紙，除列舉事實，反駁當局之宣言，且斷定故王確爲被弒。在民意之强烈督促下，鑾巴立不得不俯順興情，組設特別審查委員會，審查此亘古未有之奇案。</p>
<p>故王保姆　陳訴慘案經過</p>
<p>除公開傳訊接近故王之宮中侍要，並另立一小組委員會，聘請國內及英美醫師，從事開棺剖驗及在素里叨醫院，實騐射擊屍體首級，以便對證證槍彈傷口。據故王之保姆娘囊稱：彼現年六十歲，昔與現王太后同校肄業，出任看護職，彼此感情融洽，嘗隨王父出國。故王出生德國，後移居巴黎，時故王年甫三月，復又轉赴美國。現王蒲眉篷即生於美國。王父性燥易怒，偶因細故，即欲自毁其身，如跳河跳樓之類。故王個性，與其王父，適正相反：彼沉默寡言，雖有感觸，亦不表諸形色；間亦不免因受刺激，鬱鬱不樂，然不常見。依照平日習慣，須待故王今王及王太后入其寢室後，彼始下樓，歸其臥房休息。事件發生之前一晚，並未發現任何不同之跡象，故王亦與平日無異。翌晨七時許，照例登樓服侍王太后；抵樓後，見王太后及現王皆已起床，因無他事，乃即轉往探視故王，即在此時，突聞槍聲一饗，彼驚惶不知所措，且聞「噯，媽媽……」之呼喊聲。及進寢室，王太后及現王已光彼入內，王太后在床上擁抱故王，現工則立於床前抱王太王后，母子皆涕淚交流，情境至爲悽慘。故王係仰面而臥，姿態一如平日熟睡者然。前額血流不止，手槍一支置於故王左手肘間。按其故王脈搏，跳動力甚微，週身則仍溫暖。故王此次歸國，有事常垂詢於彼，蓋認彼爲至親也。其間曾有一次、向彼表示，應如何始能促使民衆獲得安居，亦可見其故王對民間疾苦開懷之一斑。故王係一英明之主，深明是非，良　悉辨，富於道德觀念。</p>
<p>名醫廿位　專司驗屍工作</p>
<p>至於剖騐故王遺體，係由著名醫生二十名專司其事。第一步，先將頭部用X光拍攝，然後剖開頭壳，用鐵條自前額之傷口插入，穿出於後腦部之後頭骨，作斜直形，再以X光拍攝，繼將前額傷口部位之皮膚割出一正方形，作爲檢騐。另在腹部開刀、取出胃及大腸，交由化騐廳化騐，結果其中並無毒素存在。在素里叨醫院所實騐射擊之死人頭級，共有七個，六個頭級概以手槍在前額射擊，距離遠近皆有，祗有一個爲自後腦射擊者。頭級射擊後全用X光拍攝存案。經過縝密之檢騐及實騐後，參加之各醫生隨即召開會議，討論其所獲得之結論。會議中規定，以警方所定之三原則，做爲討論之繩準。三原則：即（一）意外，（二）自殺，（三）被殺。</p>
<p>暴崩前夕　未受任何刺激</p>
<p>會議開始後，先由心理學方面之醫生宣佈其意見，據稱：經過縝密之檢騐實騐，包括故王寢室之實地視察後，絕不發現有足可促使故王自殺之原因。此外，復調查故王在生前，尤其在事件發生之前夜，並未受過何種刺激。與王太后、王弟旣無意見上之衝突，雖最親近之保姆、故王亦不一現不豫或不樂之神色，所言者祗屬於應覓取何種途經，可使民衆安居樂業而已。</p>
<p>骨骼專家　驗明射擊情形</p>
<p>依照骨骼專家稱：頭蓋骨破裂及洞穿，實由子彈在最近部位射擊所致。子彈之穿過頗爲迅速，以及子彈之爆射力，結果使頭蓋骨呈現裂痕。根據X光及顯微鏡專家之報吿稱：所割下之前額四方形皮膚，經縝密之檢騐後，發現傷口處下凹呈圓孔，此現象由於受槍管之力壓。後以十一公厘口徑之手槍套於傷口之皮膚，適相符合。在下凹處之週圍，復查出有火藥，充分證明，子彈係由前額而進，在後腦部之後頭骨下端穿出。察其情形，係在床頭受擊，子彈始在後頭骨穿出。再檢騐其死屍首級，在前額所射擊之子彈途徑係平直，明言之，即前額進而在後腦之後頭骨上端穿出。至於由後腦發彈之實騐，則彈出之前額，其傷口實較後腦之入口爲大。</p>
<p>誰是兇手　議論至為紛紜</p>
<p>至是，會議遂一致同意，故王之死，確係被殺。且一致認爲故王被殺時係熟睡於床上，兇手自床頭入，以槍管描貼於前額皮膚，然後攀動槍機而發彈者。至是，亞南他瑪希倫之死，由於被殺，業已成爲確切不移之定論，而殺者爲誰，爲何竟至被殺，可分兩方而加以解答之：有人謂爲暹羅國內反動派所下之毒手。因爲亞南他瑪希倫年紀雖輕，然受高等敎育，思想淸新，與國內新派，極爲接近。此次預備出國，擬先訪美，不欲直往歐洲，當其行程已決之時，社尼巴莫復因法兵犯境，自吿奮勇，願充暹羅代表，同赴美國求援。此與暹王訪美，節奏相符，反動派疑其含有政治作川。另一足以引起反動派之憎恨者爲在出國之前，巡視華僑各區域及各團體機關，接受華僑之熱烈歡迎，與各華僑代表會餐，發表親華談話。</p>
<p>案情復雜　謂有國際背景</p>
<p>有人謂邊境紛爭，情勢嚴重，駐暹英軍復又舉行演習，假想佔據暹羅重要地區及其政府機關、與法兵遙相呼應。繼而大批英軍由馬來亞開入暹羅南部，揚言剿匪。此一連串之事實，似皆說明國際之暴風雨正向黃金半島之白象國襲來！處此凶險情勢下，突然發生國王暴死之不幸事件，似有理由認爲不無出自國際背景，企圖造成暹羅內亂，坐收漁人之利。月餘以來，暹羅國內，已多騷動：鑾巴立本人，亦於日前親自發表談話，已往數次動亂，皆屬兵不血刃，觀察目前情勢，流血則在所不免。</p>
<p>僑胞揮淚　聯合舉行公祭</p>
<p>一九三五年，暹羅發生革命，政制由君主專制改爲君主立憲第七世王亡命英國，下詔遜位，讓由其姪繼承，其姪即亞南他瑪希倫。一九三八年亞南他瑪希倫自歐洲返國登基，约時年甫十三歲，未幾再赴瑞士求學。在鑾披汶當權期內，皇室備受控制，財產且有被其宣佈沒收者，第七世王亦於是時身亡異域。此次大戰停止後，亞南他瑪希倫於去年十二月五日重返故國，本擬稍留，即行赴歐，因新憲法一時未及草就，暹暹其行，直至簽署公佈後，始決定接受杜魯門總統之邀，專程訪美。彼對暹羅執政老之所行所施，深爲不滿，惟以大權尚非已屬，究亦無能爲力。巡視華僑商業區時，在歡迎會上答詞曾有「中暹兩民族在歷史上已有深切之關係，此後更須親善合作」之句，予我僑胞以極好印象。此次横遭慘死，無異中國失一良友，僑胞至爲悼惜。中華總商會及潮州，海南，廣肇，客屬，福建，江浙等六會館聯合舉行公祭，潮州會館輓聯云：</p>
<p>「繼位逾十年，岐山鳳鳴，黎庶謳歌頌聖主；</p>
<p>歸　甫半載、鼎湖龍去，潮僑揮淚痛明君。」</p>
<p>現據官方報道：暹羅新王與警察當局均證明馬希道爾之死，係出偶然，一塲暴風雨於焉吿終。</p>

<h3>從四外長會議到巴黎和會</h3>
<p>— 本報十一日倫敦航訊　特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>多災多難的巴黎和會，現在總算可以召開了。在和約的草擬期間，所有難題，雖多半是蘇聯提出，但目前和约草案之能完成，也多半是由於蘇聯的讓步。</p>
<p>當六月十五日四國外長在巴黎第二次集議時，其代表承命所製備的表格，列舉四外長所已同意及未同意諸點，各有二十餘條，洋洋大觀。但會議席上眞正爭執的，僅爲義大利和約中的三個問題：（一）賠款問題，（二）義大利殖民問題，（三）特里埃斯脫問題。就中賠款數額和原則，四外長於四月間第一次會議時已經決定，義大利應賠蘇聯一億美元。這次四外長所爭的是賠款的來源問題，和一部分折付賠款的資財的佔價問題。凡在蘇聯境內，東歐蘇聯勢力範圍內及德國蘇軍駐區內的義大利財產，全部佔價，由蘇聯接收，抵償賠款。不過這些財產總價値的估計，美國的與蘇聯的專家意見不同，因此在會塲上亦曾稍費唇舌；但這究竟是專家問題，可以客觀硏究的，結果仍交給專家去重估。此外義大利的一部分軍需工廠和船隻數艘，亦交給蘇聯，作爲賠款。如果仍不足一億美金之數時，再由義大利今後生產的物品運拾蘇聯，作價抵補。關於最後一個項目下的物產種類和淸償年限，亦曾發生爭執，但最後決定，爲在和約生效後三年內開始付給，從始付日算起，六年內付淸。至於種類的決定，則由蘇義二國政府商定。</p>
<h3>沉悶的北國</h3>
<p>— 本報十八日天津航訊　特約記者李紹林</p>
<p>北國的氣候正熟得厲害，雖然時有陣雨帶來些凉意，但轉瞬即逝，解不脫悶人的炎熟，時局在陰霾下到處起着槍聲，更增加了人們的煩悶，人心所反映的，已不是如何去尋求和平，而祗是夢一樣的瞭望着和平在甚麽時候可以到臨，大家似乎已消失了積極的呼喚和平的勇氣，變成消極的無可奈何的期待。</p>
<p>從重慶直開到南京的和平談判，由無限希望演變為渺茫的無限希望，於是多少人又掉轉頭來，注意那些一地一區的枝節談判，總期望一地的談判成功，另一地也跟着會有希望，但是陳毅不肯去靑島，林彪暫緩赴長春，又使民衆的希冀成了空，期望變成泡，現在所剩下的，除了無比的苦悶外，祗有盲目的等待，氣候熱成這種樣子，多少人竟在期待着來一陣頃盆大雨，天上確是濃雲密佈，這雨眞的會落下來嗎？</p>
<p>津浦北段在本月上旬的三天大戰，是光復以來前所未有的大規模衝突，當時共軍的目標有兩個，一是靑縣，一是滄縣，靑縣方面，共軍使用的兵力有第三十三團，三十五團，六十三團，保定大隊，新樂大隊，津南支隊，野炮兵連，及民兵一部，滄縣方面，有共軍第二十四團，七十八團，十七團，十八團，滄縣大隊等，全部兵力约兩萬餘，衝突之初，從天津到滄的鐵路線，每一個重要車站都遭到共軍攻擊和破壞，繼之共軍的主力指向靑縣，這一仗打了三日三夜，共軍於八日被擊退，靑縣遂吿解圍，結果是共軍被殲一千五百餘人，而吃苦最大、受損最甚的是沿線的民衆，誰能說共軍的目的就在於此，近幾日津浦北寗兩線都大致平靜，但是聽聽周恩來先生的談話，似乎難保牠就如此平靜下去。</p>
<p>顧祝同，熊式輝，張嘉璈，盧漢等一行，十七日下午過天津北去，在車站停留未足一刻鐘，即忽忽去平，熊氏表示此行並沒有甚麼任務，但許多人意味着這不是一個普通的旅行，假使要證明他們此來是爲消夏的話，那便是天津市杜副市長曾於前一日由津去北戴河替他們準備行邸，但是顧氏等並未在北戴河停留，熊氏在車中曾分別答復記者的詢問，第一個問題當然是東北衝突的情形，熊氏說，近來尙稱平靜，又問杜林的會晤何以未能成功，他說，因爲林彪不到長春去，至於林彪爲甚麽不去，那就不得而知了，記者曾單獨的與張嘉璈談了數分鐘，關於東北工礦的接收和整頓，張氏表示正在逐步擴展和整頓，張氏說東北工礦的恢復，主要問題是電力，我問：我們有無力量把所需的電力恢復起來，張氏稍微頓了一下說，總可以的。</p>
<p>專車離津之後，新聞記者立刻接到一項通知：此項新聞不能發表，但翌日平津各報一律都登出來了，新聞檢查取消後，新聞界確是有了自由了。</p>
<p>今天來觀察北方大局，實在還看不出所以然來，因爲整個的大局還在混沌中，天津的軍車當局，曾一再堅决的表示，津市治安是極爲鞏固，這一點確已取得民衆的信賴，雖然數十里之外就是共軍的區域，人心却是異常的安定，本月十六日起，天津市當局開始訓練市民，最初曾引起一些市民的疑惑，經當局正面表示是爲補助警察之不足，而從事地方警衛，人們的心理也漸漸安定下來了。</p>
<p>再過幾天，便是靑紗帳起的時候，能否把牠太平的度過去，這要事實來答復了，倘若農民的血汗被珍視的話，那些莊稼應該不再受到傷害，倘若我們的物力被認爲極度貧乏，约也可以瞭然於攻進來退出去的戰爭是無益的，看一個近例：靑縣之役，被俘獲的數十名共軍，他們就要被編入地方團隊去，這些人算是解放人的呢，還是被解放的呢，壓根兒他們不曉得是怎麽回事。</p>
<h3>特港問題成立折衷案</h3>
<p>特里埃斯脫因住民種族的複雜，且爲巴爾幹半島商貨的出入口，所以一向是國際糾紛問題之一。四外長第一次在巴黎聚會時，一談到義大利在非洲的領土，總說：「顧念到義大利或將在其他地區傷失領土，」即階示蘇聯的用意，必欲使特港完全脫離義大利，而併於南斯拉夫。實際上第二次四外長會議中，爭論最劇的問題，即是特港問題。最後居然能大收依照法國建議，成立折衷案，可謂是第二次四外長會議中成就最大的一點。現在把已同意的草案，譯錄如次：</p>
<p>（一）四外長同意建立特里埃斯脫自由領土，其區域包括法國所建議界綫杜諾（Duino）以西，及西達奴伐（Cittanuova）以南的全部領域。</p>
<p>（二）此自由領土之完整與獨立，由聯合國安全理事會保證。</p>
<p>（三）由安理會委派代表（包括四强代表），組織特種委員會，於咨商南斯拉夫及義大利政府的意見後，向廿一國和平會議提出，關於該領土行政組織的建議。</p>
<p>（四）此自由領土之法規，經安理會核准後，依照聯合國約章第十五條，向聯合國大會提出報吿。</p>
<p>（五）關於此領土臨時政府及永久法規之制定，由廿一國和平會議提出建議。</p>
<p>（六）其臨時政府及永久法規之制定，應依左列原則：</p>
<p>甲，此領土行政首長，應由安理會商詢南義代表意見後委派。　乙，臨時政府中之立法及司法機構，應依民主方式建立。</p>
<p>丙，其公民所享關於語言，宗敎，報章，敎育及服務公職權利，應受尊重。</p>
<p>丁，其行政首長，應每年向安理會提出報吿。</p>
<h3>義殖民地訂立新協議</h3>
<p>處理義大利殖民地問題，也有好幾點意外的進展，杜特坎尼斯歸併於希臘，其在非洲的領土，目前暫維現狀，待一年後再作最後決定。其協議的全文如左：</p>
<p>（一）義大利放棄其在非洲一切領土的所有權與名義。</p>
<p>（二）在獲得最後決定前，上述領土，仍由現在的行政機構統治。</p>
<p>（三）上一述領土的最後一處置應由四强於和約生效後一年內，依照四强所發聯合宣言之原則決定之。</p>
<p>至於聯合宣言的草案則有下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）四强同意於義大利和約生效後一年內，共同決定義大利非洲領土的最後處置。</p>
<p>（二）四强於最後處置上述領土時，應依照左例決議之一，或一條以上。至於其是否適用於全部領土或其中十部分領土，應視當地住民志願及有關各國政府之意見決定之。</p>
<p>甲，獨立。</p>
<p>乙，合併入鄰近領土內。</p>
<p>丙，由聯合國集體或其中一國託治。</p>
<p>（三）四强如不能依照上項決議成立協議時，應提交聯合國大會，要求提出建議，四强因以同意接受，並採適當步驟實行之。惟須顧及英政府於戰時所給予塞敏西（Senussi）之諾言。</p>
<p>（四）外長代表，繼續商討處置義大利非洲殖民地的問題，並得對上述各地或任何一地，派遣調查團，搜尋於建議外長會議最後解決上項問題有關之材料。</p>
<h3>美英合作蘇聯陷孤立</h3>
<p>義大利殖民地問題，雖未完全解決，祗是拖延一年，但就各方初意的紛歧及其發展過程來看，進展已很可觀了，我們知道蘇聯原意，要佔有杜特坎尼斯；或單獨託治屈里波立坦尼亞（Tripoliatnia）的，但在第一次四外長會議中，蘇聯知道自己的提案，不能通過，轉血贊成由聯合國託治或仍由義國託治一部分，這和美國意見幾乎一致。英國對于擴大帝國勢力，興趣本濃，何况義大利在非洲的領土，本在它佔領之下，自然更想據爲已有。最初是想把處置殖民地問題與和約本身分開，這在第一次四外長會議中幾乎不可能，所以提出體意見，欲把昔爾尼加（Cyrenaica）受英國託治，而于里比亞（Libya），則以英政府曾于戰時，許諾塞奴西，保證其戰後獨立寫由，主張畀予獨立。英國之所謂獨立，自然是以埃及外约但等國爲藍本的，成爲大英帝國勢力範圍內的另一環。蘇聯于此，攻擊最爲沉痛。所以在第一次四外長會議時，關于殖民地問題，英國意見甚爲孤立，熒蘇法相接近。但在這次（第二次）四外長會議中，美國不再反對英國，所以處置殖民地的問題，實際上完全依照貝文的建議通過，英國終未完全貫澈，至少也很接近它原來的計劃了。這種轉變似發生于第一次四外長會議後，及第二次四外長會議前。英美之間，是否有諒解，不得而知，但英國的外交，向以機靈見稱，利用他國的矛盾對之，謀取本身的利益，這是英國外交的一貫方針。又在第二次四外長會議中，英美合作，亳無間隙，遠較第一次會議時爲佳。英美密切合作，蘇聯澈底孤立，這是這次四外長會議有成就的主因之一。</p>
<h3>美國撒手蘇聯即讓步</h3>
<p>四外長會議中，除有關於和约本身的爭執外，對於和會方面，也有問題，如日期的決定，及在請柬上附以議事規程，及邀請國問題等。其中最後一次、關係中國，蘇聯反對中國亦列爲邀請國之一，美國代表，說此舉等於侮辱中國。而英國代表說，蘇聯祗要不是意在侮辱中國，中國是否列爲邀請國之一，他無成見。莫洛托夫於此，雖未發明，無意侮辱中國，但也不欲說明有意侮辱中國，這案子也就無人堅持了。</p>
<p>這次會議中，秘密商談，應用頗廣，因此，避免了許多因面子問題而造成的僵局，許多小問題，都在事先商成妥協，會議中順利通過。最有效促成蘇聯讓步的方法，自然是英美威脅直接提交聯合國大會及分別議訂和約。在大的國際會議中，蘇聯常是少數派，已經一再領敎過了。而義大利則現在英美勢力之下，蘇聯如與英美分手，單獨去與義大利訂立和约，則所得恐更少，自然寗願讓步。所以每次美國表示寗願撤手時，蘇聯就肯讓步，這是會議有成績的主要原因之一。</p>

<h3>勞作藝術的意義</h3>
<p>— 姜丹書</p>
<p>「勞作」是藝術的一種，民國二十一，二年間，敎育部修正課程標準中，定爲課程的名詞。以後頗爲敎育家所重視，甚至部章有勞作不及格亦須留級的規定。因爲勞作是人類天生具有的一種藝術本能。</p>
<p>有人以爲勞作是授與技術的，此非完全中肯之說，須知他關於敎育的意義，實重於技術的意義。即以小學而論，兒童的天性，沒有一個不歡喜勞，不歡喜作，換句話說，就是個個歡喜動，歡喜攪，（讀若稿，杭州話）。只要有得攪，不問　什麽都好；</p>
<p>人有勞動根性　且不論是官家之子或平民之子，城裏人或鄉下人，都憂一樣的，此乃人類同具的「勞動根性」。此根性，便是「生活的源泉藝術的本能」，人不勞動，不能生活，也不應該生活，所以這個根性，非常實貴的，在敎育的手段上和機會上，亟須加以培養發達，不可抹殺减退。中庸曰：「天命之謂性，率性之謂道，修道之謂敎」。吾人旣有這個好天性，當然應該依着這個自然的道理，因勢利導地來教練他，而所謂因勢利導的方法，便是勞作課，此乃「勞作」所以成爲一種「敎育」的重要原理。</p>
<p>小學校內的勞作課，是養成勞動習慣的，不是授與各種按術的，中學校內的勞作課，固然要並重些技術，但也不是授與專門</p>
<p>勞作能夠醫治時髦病　技術，仍應偏重在養成勞動習慣和工作興趣的。說得明白些，注重在「醫　病」，「醫　　病」，這些病如能根本上醫好，才可踏進「　實」，「勤儉」，「節約」，「廉潔」，「堅貞」，諸道德圈內。當此人欲横流，奢靡成俗之時，舊紈袴，一變而爲新滑頭，頭上膏沐，身上筆挺，衣上噴香，足上放光，伸手端碗，縮手放筷，此種人，滔滔皆是。尤其有些新式太太們，脂粉而外，　首血爪，手鐲而外，脚鐲如鐐，他們固然不曾勞動，不肯勞動，且欲瞧不起對方的勞動家，笑爲曲辮子，鄙夷他人勤僕的美德，而自詡爲漂亮，更將自己寳貝的小國民，裝飾得如洋囡囡一般，嬌慣得與賈寳玉無二，包車接送學校，汽車接送公園，有時還要帶到紅燈綠幕之下，吃吃珍羞，看看跳舞，從小便養成一股嬌嬾奢浮之習，使他成爲不良的第二天性，眞是不可救藥！勞作藝術對此病根，恰好痛下針砭，偏要叫你的洋囡囡來掃地，抹桌，倒痰盂，拌爛泥，學做小木匠，小裁縫，還要到園場裏去學種蔬菜，花木，澆水，澆糞，使你的洋囡囡和小徒弟，小牧童一樣，正因如此如此，乃引起不明藝術教育的家庭反對。小孩回來了，衣裳弄髒了，娘問幹嗎？兒說做勞作，於是乎勞作先生的耳朶，要遠遠的發熱了吧？其實小孩予自己，倒是一不怕勞，二不怕作，三不怕髒，四不自以爲少爺小姐，來得價喜歡做勞作，這便可見勞動的根性，確是天生的，敎育應該順天性，不可逆天性，關於此點，希望家庭的見解，要與學校一致，方能養成平民化和平等化的第二代國民。</p>
<p>我很相信一個人，如能從小到大，受着家庭和學校一貫的有系統的良好的勞作藝術，可能養成這樣的「品型」。——如無現成飯吃，能自炊；衣裳破了，能自打布釘；　了，能自洗，如被朋友看見做這些事，不自以爲難爲情；</p>
<p>勞作可能培養成好品型　凳脚壞了，能自裝；電燈壞了，能自修；出門防雨，能拿紙傘或破洋傘；半途遇雨，能赤脚；平日能種菜養雞，臨時能樵柴捉魚；倒老爺罷工了，能目倒馬桶；黄包車夫敲竹檟，能拔起脚來自走；生活指數過於高了，同時生活費收入過於低了，不足以養廉了，也能做些小工藝品賣錢或自利用；……但是如能一旦飛黄騰達起來，同樣可以做好官；因爲旣有這樣能耐，處常當然淸廉，處變不致失節，貧賤能自安，富貴不驕淫，你若不信，請翻開歷史來看：大政治家的舜、是農夫，漁夫，兼燒窯司務出身；伊尹是農夫出身；我們的姜太公，也是漁夫出身；後生小子的朱買臣是樵夫出身；陶淵明，諸葛亮之流，也實行種過田；還有許多僕學大師，都能自做生活，自奉生活；他們都是腦筋複雜，生活簡單，肚裏有貨色，面上沒架子，換句話說，就是能文能武，能粗能細的典型人物，未做官時或未發財時，並不天天想做官，夜夜想發財，旣做官後，自然能拿出苦幹的精神來，代公家做事，不像後世人尤其現代人這樣處處擺架子，時時想撈錢啦；可見勞動與知識，非但不相背，而且互相成，所以希望賢明的家庭和一般人士，莫說勞作亳無價値，來反對。</p>
<h3>文人畫的創始作家　宗炳和王微</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>一般人以爲中國的文人畫是創始於唐朝的王維，王洽等，明代的董其昌，還硬把歷代畫家分成南宗北宗兩大派，並用「黄袍加身」的辦法，尊崇王維是南宗畫的開山祖師·這眞未免有點「數典忘祖」因爲眞正的文人畫創始者，却是較王維早到三百多年的宗炳和王微。</p>
<p>宗炳字少文，南陽湼陽人，生在東晋孝武帝寗康二年（西曆三七四）死在宋文帝元嘉二十年（西曆四四三）年六十九，和頭愷之同時，他的死約後顧氏三十年。王微字景玄，臨沂人，生在東晋安帝義熙十一年，（西曆四一五）死在宋文帝元嘉二十年，僅僅活了二十九歲。他生在顧愷之死的那一年，而死又和宗炳同年，可謂凑巧之極，特壽夭不同罷了。</p>
<p>宗炳王微二人不特生在同一時代，而且他們的性情，學問，藝術和著作，都有很多相同的地方。炳「居喪過禮，鄉閭所稱，」「妻羅氏亦有高情，與少文協趣羅氏歿，少文哀之過甚。」他對於二兄的遺孤，極盡贍義之職，可見是一位篤行君子。王微也是篤於手足之情的人，他的弟弟僧謙有才學，遇疾，微自處治，僧謙因爲服藥不合法而死，微深自咎恨發病，在僧謙死後的四旬，他便以二十九年的妙齡竟殉弟而終。</p>
<p>宗炳是「妙善琴書，精言理的」，王微是「少好學，無不通覽，善屬文，能書畫，兼解音律醫方，陰陽術數」的，可以說都是多才多藝的藝術家。</p>
<p>宗炳家境雖然很窮，但不爲利錄所誘，宋武帝想招他做主簿，他辭而不就，問其故，他說「炳栖丘領谷三十年，」武帝善其對而止，他請願優游山林作栖丘領谷的隱士，却不肯作趨炎赴勢的主簿，人品之高，也就可以想見，他又好「閒居無事，」以修義心性。至於王微也是「常居一室，讀書玩古，不出十餘年」，世祖因爲他貞栖絕俗，贈秘書監，也是一位不樂仕進的雅士。他兩人這種態度在現代看來，似乎太消極，太灰色，沒有拯世濟民的積極精神，但是一個藝術家却需要貞介絕俗的個性，才能不爲利誘，不爲威屈，神遊於天地靈虛之境而不爲外物所　，這種鄙廉懦立的一塵不染，一介不取的精神，從巢父許由伯夷叔　老子莊子，一直傳到宗炳王微，實是中國哲學上，倫理上，藝術上，一種超世的態度，而且形成了中國藝術的原始生命。「人品不高，用墨無法，」藝術家要是沒有崇高的人品，他的作品也就沒有永恒的價値。可惜現在有許多自命爲藝術家的人忘記了（或者根本不曉得）中國藝術家根本的立脚點，在平日隨波逐流的製作，迎合富商大賈所喜歡的東西。在國運兀臬的時代，又不惜奴顏婢膝的媚敵事仇，像這種人根本沒有骨氣，沒有人品，縱然他的技巧很純熟，色彩很豓麗，所有作品被一般以耳代目的人爭先購買，其實是亳無價値，只有軀壳，缺乏靈魂的虛偽作品，不足以傳世的。</p>
<p>宗炳有「畫山水序」王微有「叙畫」等著作。同是中國畫論裏最早最妙的瑰寳。不但文辭高妙，而闡發繪畫的原理，却有獨到的見解，他的要旨，在於將繪畫從實用方面解放出來，而與以自由活潑，虛靈理想的境界，從此便成了文人畫的濫觴，而使中國藝術。具備了一種「迥不猶人」的異彩。</p>

<p>美術中心站，這名稱似乎很生疏。說得誇張些，是中國教育史上的創舉；說得淺就一點，爲了目前敎育文化經費的支絀，才有這簡易的美術敎育機構的建立。</p>
<p>中國推行新敎育，已有近四十年的歷史，而美術敎育，猶未能普及，任何優美的美術品，不爲一般人的愛好，任何有價値的美術展覽會，得不到一般人的重視，好像美術和社會是亳無關係。過去，敎育當局沒有注意到這問題，學校不重視這問題，因此；社會上沒有一點美術機構如美術館，畫廓等設立、社會民衆得不到高尚的調濟精神的工具。學校裏美術科成爲不生不死有名無實的科目，一切設備，師資，都是空虛而極不完整。學生家長瞧不起美術，認爲無裨實用，學生們也就亳不認眞的去接受美術敎</p>
<p>本市復員後，敎育當局首先注意到這美術敎育問題。於是便產生了這美術中心站，牠的目的，扼要地講：除了推廣民衆美術敎育以外，還要解決本市各學校美術敎育的設施和師資的困難。希望使一般人瞭解美術和人生的關係，進而向美術方面去追求合理的精神生活；同時，使本市美術敎育可以認真推行。茲就美術中心站的工作目標，約略介紹：美兩中心站的工作目標有二</p>
<p>（一）倡導社會民衆美術的欣賞和硏究；</p>
<p>（二）輔助學校美術敎育的實施。</p>
<p>第一項可分五項辦法實施：</p>
<p>（一）舉行各種美術展覽會；（二）辦理美術講座；（三）設置巡廻畫廓；（四）召集美術界座談會。（五）舉辦業餘美術研究班。</p>
<p>第二項可分四項辦法去實施：（一）硏究美術敎材與敎法；（二）供應美術敎具和設備；（美術中心站附近學校，排定日期，可以到站實習）。（三）輔導美術敎師進修；（舉行美術敎育示範）。（四）增進美術敎育效能。（對於藝術天才兒童，特別予以訓練）</p>
<p>根據這兩大目標去進行，工作是十分的艱重，希望國內的美術敎育家和美術家多方協助，使本市美術敎育得有相當的成就。</p>
<h3>山水畫的布置法（上）</h3>
<p>— 承名世</p>
<p>學山水畫的人，只要天分不十分低劣，對於用筆用墨法的了解，是比較容易的，至於畫樹畫石等實際技術，更不難學會。惟獨對於章法——即布置法，——初學不但運用困難，便是了解其原理，也不十分容易。現在我們專就這一點來加以較詳細的說明，這樣才能打破專門臨摹不能創稿的弊病。</p>
<p>要說明山水畫的布置，先得說明山水畫的構圖原理。原來山水畫的構圖，不是對景實寫，而是用鳥瞰的方法，將眞景縮小，然後加以描寫的。譬如我們到郊外去看眞山水，眼睛中所能看到的，本來只有一層山或一重水，像這樣簡單的景物，是不容易構成山水畫面的。我們非得走入山水的深處，遍觀所有的風景，回到家裏，把所經歴的地方，像畫地圖似的縮寫出來，作畫的人，把自己放得很大，把風景縮得很小，好像看似山似的，所以能構成「咫尺千里」的畫面。明白了這一點，我們便能知道「透視」的原理，所以不能完全應用於中國山水畫的道理了。</p>
<p>不過話又說回來，中國山水畫也有很像真景的，如宋代的米芾，馬遠，夏珪。明末淸初的石溝，石谿，　半千，梅瞿山等人的畫，往往與眞景相去不遠。不過這祗是中國山水畫裏的變格，而不能代表中國山水畫的正統畫法。我們普通所看見的山水畫，總是重山複嶺，深遠無際，這種風景，祗可用腦子去想像，或者在畫裏看到，在眞的自然界裏我們看不到全部。</p>
<p>有人說：中國山水畫所代表的是由上看下的景緻，這句話固然也有相當的理由，因爲人的立足點愈高，所見便愈廣，所見的東西也愈小，所謂「孔子登東而山小魯，登泰山而小天下」，就是這個道理。不過中國山水畫如果眞是寫的由上看下的景緻，那末山脚下的東西便不能看得十分大而淸楚。現在普通的山，畫，總是以山脚下面的景物爲主的，所謂主樹主石水往往描寫得十分到家，而上面的山峯，却多是描寫其大意的。這依舊不合透視的原理，所以說中國山水畫所描寫的是由上看下的景緻，理由仍不十分圓滿，不過似乎有這棵的趨勢罷了。</p>
<p>總而言之，中國山水畫所畫的是詩，所畫的是經過詩人剪裁的材料，不是原來的呆山笨水。所以繁的布景，千山萬壑，極雄偉之致；簡的布景，一樹一石，又極高曠之趣。它是抽象的，文學的，甚至於是哲學的，不能用科學的學理來解釋，這是它的短處，同時也是它的長處。</p>
<p>中國山水畫的布景，普通有三種法則：第一種是平遠——是由近看遠的景緻，布置宜平坦曠遠，而不宜高峻重疊。第二種是高遠——是由下看上的景緻，布置宜高危峻峭，而不宜平曠深隔。第三種是深遠——是由外看內的景緻，布置宜深邃渺遠，而不宜淺露板實。也有平遠而兼高遠或深遠的，高遠而兼深遠或平遠的，深遠而兼平遠或高遠的。不過種種布局之法，難然千變萬化，但其原則，終不外乎「三遠」的道理。（小幅和横幅宜用平遠，横幅亦宜用深遠，大幅和直幅宜用高遠和深遠，直幅尤宜用高遠）。</p>
<p>平遠的布景，多用坡脚和沙，水表現；高遠的布景，多用路徑和瀑泉表現；深遠的布景，多用層　和雲烟表現。這也是學山水的人所應知道的。</p>
<p>無論平遠高遠和深遠，布置樹石山巒的層次、祗有一個秘訣，便是「人字排列法」。所調「人字」是倒寫的人字。譬如偏左畫一叢樹石，算作一層，偏右再畫一叢樹石，又是一層，偏左的左面高，向右斜下，偏右的右面高，向左斜下，這兩層的結構，便成一個倒人字。再偏左畫一座山峯，偏右畫一座山峯，又成一個倒人字，如此重疊上去，便成無數個倒人字了（平遠的層次少。高遠和深遠的層次多，尤其是深遠，層次不多，便乏幽邃的趣味）。不過每一層所佔面積的大小，不可一律，第一層面積大，第二層面積便應該較小，第三層面積小，第四層面積便應該較大，如此參差變換，布局便不會呆板了。還有一點三個大「人字」的當中，往往包含着許多小「人字」；總之無處不參差，無處不變化，方盡能事。</p>

<h3>藝術漫談</h3>
<p>— 黃涵秋譯　Takarmura著</p>
<p>藝術的意義，不可當做世俗所說的「寫意」來看待。世閱上在實際社會生活疲勞的人們，到了晚上靜待晚餐的時候，得到了一杯藏在拿破崙時代的葡萄酒的這種神氣來比做藝術，便會發生錯誤。然世間以這樣來比做藝術成爲普遍的事情，又能使世間的人得到了那樣的東西，便算是藝術家的能事，果然不作這樣想的亦不乏其人，但在事實上有許多是作這樣想的。藝術使人得到安慰，使人增加興味，其結果使嘗到實際社會的苦味的人們，好像得到了一種寳貴的換味品，凡作這樣想的是現在世間的常識。</p>
<p>照這樣的現世是把世間原來的調子降低，所以在這樣的現世的人們是沒有顧到自己本來的虛弱，這不能顧到的一點完全是病態。</p>
<p>從前一德國詩人，有以藝術是從人們的遊戲本能而發生之說，而迷信於此說的學者亦復不少。此雖可以把人們的生活所剩餘之力以趨向藝術來解說，如果就以人們的娛樂慾與藝術慾同一看待，那好像是很大的錯誤。</p>
<p>藝術不是慰安人們而是加强人們的意志；不是增加興味而是使得有所考慮。使人們向上，使人們進步，又使人們更滿意。不是以姑息的手段來撫慰日常的苦味，而是給與能堪忍之苦味的—這根蒂之力。在實際的社會生活中，不是用來慰安吭唷吭唷的更新　，而是給與消去吭唷吭唷的營養劑。好比一種敎人以肉體雖然困憊而靈魂不疲的，不可思議的魔術。着眼於藝術的事，即是爲人們開光明的世界的事。藝術是顯示人們及圍繞人們森羅萬象的實相，使人們覺悟到這浮沉而不常住的，並流轉於現世的相之底的眞實的「美」。使人們偏從限於同志爲對象的生活，常使人們以上的東西保持於心中，使生活向上。而使把握人世的意義。不須思辯而使之直接得到。在世人往往以明於世故，通於人情之機徴，而洞悉於人事之紆迴曲折的人們來飽嘗人世的意義，是常有的事。然這不外乎是一種字典。雖然可貴，但光是如此則不過是爲擁有集積材料的人們以外無所得了。爲何而定欲保持這可貴的材料，則還不得而知之。從不得而知之地方起，大都陷於低級的悟道，或竟繼續於這種惡辣的游戲而渡過了一生。藝術爲對於這種病人狀態的世界，是可以使牠恢復健康。</p>
<p>反之，沒有那樣有力的藝術，那是十分低級的藝術。被玩弄或被愛撫方面的藝術，本來不得稱之謂藝術。</p>
<p>生產建設</p>
<h3>自信的心理</h3>
<p>— 王鸎</p>
<p>每星期一出版</p>
<p>在產業界中，自信的心理，非常重要，尤其在目前工業已頻險境的時候。很有許多工廠的負責人，以爲中國工業，照這種情形下去，可以說是沒有希望，這種心理，就是因爲缺乏自信的心理。</p>
<p>事實上，祇需埋頭苦幹，改進品質，努力建設，中國工業的產物，也可以和先進國家所製造的貨品相等。所以，我們應該由努力而造成自信的心理，由自信的心理出發而有事實的表現。等到貨品的品質提高以後，不但能够立足，更可以迅速發展。</p>
<h3>紡織工業建設的重點</h3>
<p>— 鄭健</p>
<p>紡織工業，爲民生首要工業。凡日常衣着用品所需，無不爺求於此。茲就管理所及，將今後我國編織工業建設重點，列舉於後，尙希同業先進，予以指正。</p>
<p>（A）建設紡織工業基礎先決問題：</p>
<p>（一）第一要求政府竭力解決當前政治嚴重癥結，停止內戰，使人民安居業業。</p>
<p>（二）從速恢復全國水陸交通，以暢物資吐納。使生產得以保持常態。並添購新式紡織機器，及自行仿造以增產量。</p>
<p>（三）提高外滙，能自行製織之紡織品應盡量减少進口，免受威脅。</p>
<p>（四）勵有關紡織工業之改良發明及熱心進展者。</p>
<p>（五）努力恢復海外原有紡織市塲，基礎，諸如南洋羣島等地。</p>
<p>（六）勞資通力合作，消弭工潮，從事努力增加生產，以達水準，與各國競爭，到那時依照蔣主席手編之「中國命運」一書，對今後全國應設千萬錠紡機當可及時擴充，然後能使全國人民衣被自給自足，以上爲先決問題。</p>
<p>（B）改進建設之重點：第一人的心理建設，要糾正它：</p>
<p>大戰勝利，河山重光，物質方面故須建設的，應從速行，心理精神方面建設的，也不容或緩，在今日艱巨建國時代，我們心理精神應以爲國效勞，爲社會服務，的基點上事事要實地求是，埋頭苦幹，肩起這光榮勝利後的艱巨工作。始終以「效勞服務」爲目的，尤望從車斯業之同志共同努力，澈底改革目前錯綜的心理和精神建設。</p>
<p>（C）運用科學方法，使理論與實踐並用；科學至理明言，工業之進步如何，尤賴科學運用恰當與否。譬如某紡織工廠操作工塲之負工，有的學識頗高，但對實踐經騐尚感不足多多，反之有經騐缺學識者故常有「知其然，而不知其所以然。」前者以憑其學識，後者以憑其經騐，不能並用，故其落後之一因也。筆者以爲廠中應附設員工養成所，及技術訓練班，以求員工學術與技術增加，以半工半讀之方法訓練之使一般員工得以理論與實踐並用之，對於科學之運用有淸楚認識。</p>
<p>（D）機械保全與人事管理：「工欲善其事，必先利其器」器利則善事成。此乃古今不易之理也。紡織機械構造複雜，若器械精良，而後生產能率可以增高；保全者即對機械保養增進壽命，可發揮機械效率，達到最大量最優良產品目的。查我國紡織機械，幾完全購自國外，形式錯雜，往往一廠之使用機械有六七稱之多，因此機構之相差，管理使用上，尤感不便，因機件之互異，偶缺其一即不能修配。以致曠日費時，因機構相差，使用工具亦難通用。保全不便，精於各種機械之保全人才亦難羅致，筆者以爲今後紡織應用機械須精選劃一，然後國人自行仿造，此不僅對保全上收益多多，則整個紡織業欲圖發展，其不可不致力於斯。（三）增設學校，培植紡織人才：我國具有文化歷史已有四五千年了！遠較歐美各國爲早，惜對科學工程教育未予重視，故對整個國家工業發展難以水準。英美各國之强盛，其紡織工業進步不已，皆以人民受到相當敎育，尤對科學工程敎育更予重視，英美人之富於創造發明，日人之善於模仿精神，其一切基礎，均賴於科學工程敎育有高度進展。我們談不上創利發明，但祗少亦得有模仿他人、應該戰戰兢兢的埋頭苦幹做去。同時並盼望政府，應增設專門學校培植紡織人才，如國營紡織廠應在短期積極籌備增設紡織學校：使旣從業學識欠缺者得以求進機綠。以及隨時培植今後所需之大量紡織人才缺乏諸問題得以解决。</p>
<h3>新麻醉劑</h3>
<p>加利福尼亞州立醫科大學最近發明一種麻醉劑，使得割治胸部的外科手術今後也能用電（Eectric　Knife），如醚和丙烷等麻醉劑都有爆炸性，用電力的時候要以電花來封閉很多小的靜脈管和動脈管，否則醚和丙烷將使這電花在病人的肺裏引起爆炸。這種新的麻醉劑是兩種極猛烈的毒物，笑氣一氧化氮和箭毒（Curare南美土人用來塗箭頭的一種毒藥，由某種植物製成，）笑氣使病人人睡，箭毒則痳痺病人的呼吸肌肉。</p>
<p>九萬基羅伏特的巨大發電機，正在美裝配，準備運往蘇聯南馬克蘭特尼泊河發電廠。該機係紐约通用電氣公司，特爲蘇聯設計者。共計三座，運往馬克蘭以代替戰時被德軍所毁壞者。（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<h3>愛用國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>愛用國貨運動，已由各方面發起，開始宣傳，這在上期本刋，曾經詳加說明，是一個糾正心理的運動，對於今後的影饗很大。</p>
<p>中國工業，實在逢着空前難關，但如果能够把社會大衆的錯誤心理糾正過來，由愛用國貨而使中國工業的產品銷路增進，即未復興中國工業，也許可以由愛用國貨運動，作爲一個起點。</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>第三·原料的品質，必須始終如一，不宜更變：</p>
<p>製售貨品，最忌的事情，就是貨品質料的减退。在最初發行的時候，品質很好，到了後來，遂漸减退，對於品質减退的原因，往往是一時不能購買與第一批相同的原料（因爲被別人搜羅了去，一時買不到，或者是原料價格增高以後，不得不改用次一號的原料）而品質减退後的結果，往往是銷路每况愈下，甚至於貨品不能銷行。</p>
<p>有許多製造廠，如藥廠等，在購買原料的時候，先要加以化騐，化騐合格，方能接受。有許多原裝的原料，不能啓封化騐，那末只有向可靠的行家購買可靠的製造廠的出品了。</p>
<p>由於上述三點，可以證明原料對於貨品的銷行和公司的前途都有極大的關係，購買原料，自然不可不愼。</p>
<p>這裏所說的原料，包括製造廠裏所用的各種原料，貨品的裝璜。如玻璃瓶等，也可以應用，這裏所說的原則，根據專家研究的結果，一個製造廠，不宜把貨品的種類做得太多，不妨先製造幾種，待銷路暢達，基礎穩定以後，再行增添新的出品，如果同時製造許多貨品，就需要有許多不同的原料和裝璜，把資金分散開來，萬一貨品不能暢銷，就要使資金呆住，尤其是裝璜品，很難出售，金錢付出以後，沒有收回的希望了。</p>
<p>購料的工作</p>
<p>原料對於貨品的關係，已經在上面說過，現在要談到購料的方法了。</p>
<p>担任購料工作的，或者是購料委員會，或者是一個購料主任，由他專司其事，但購料的原則是相同的。</p>
<p>一個担任購料工作的人，要使他的購料工作發生優良的效果，必須其備下列條件：一·熟悉市場情形：各種原料，在市面有多少存底（就是市面上總共有多少數量）牠們的消耗量，以致市價的漲落，都是應該詳加調查的。所以一個負責購料工作的人，應不時與有關係的各方面取得聯絡，使能得到比較迅速而可靠的情報，可以在購料工作上，得到不少便利。</p>
<p>二·堅強的判斷力：在得到情報以後是否應立即購買，應購買多少數量，都應該立時取決，所以一個主持的人，要有堅强的判斷力。福特汽車廠之大熔爐，鐵液傾出時，火光四射，由於鋼鐵供應之不足，福特煉鋼廠日夜開工，增加生產，以應需要。（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>

<h3>要苦幹</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「我們應當研究我們的缺點究竟在什麼地方，是人才嗎？學問嗎？然後努力加以克服。也許我們要再吃五年或十年苦，但是如果紙吃苦而不作探討和研究，那麽吃苦的時間祗會更延長。我們文化界，敎育界，應當在這五年十年之間，咬緊牙關……」</p>
<p>以上是胡適之先生離國九年，回到上海來後，第一次公開說話時所作的一個結論。</p>
<p>九一八以後，那時上海的罷課罷工風起雲湧，大家都無心讀書，記得一位敎幾何的德國敎授曾勸我們不必亂嚷亂呌，這種呌囂，不但不是愛國，反是害國。他說：我們德國在第一次大戰戰敗以後，舉國上下沒有一個人在喊呌，大家都沉默着埋頭苦幹，學生拚命讀書研究，工人拚命做工，平常工作八小時，這時幾乎工作十二小時，十五年的苦幹，使國力又恢復了，不再怕任何國外的侵侮了。</p>
<p>今日，我們的抗戰勝利了，我們恭爲四强之一，憑心說，太慚愧了！用任何本物和人家比較，都要羞赧無地。日本現在是戰敗國，從東京回來的朋友說，他們並未有如喪考妣的情緒，他們對一切工作都打疊起精神來做，絲出口已經恢復，許多工廠逐漸開工，糧食恐慌則縮緊肚皮節省，同時加緊生產，發明各種代用品以補助。讀書的風氣越發濃郁，無論政治上的任何黨派，沒有不從恢復國力着手。決不是危言聳聽，倘使我們這一代不爭氣，打定基礎，十年廿年以後，中日戰爭說不定還有一次，那個時候，我們很難再遭遇到現在這樣的好運氣了。所以爲我們的兒孫着想，誠如胡適先生所說，在這五年十年之內，應當咬緊牙關，埋頭苦幹！</p>
<h3>「炒黑市」　香港近事</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>公價二字似乎是這次戰爭的產物，與配給二字同時在世界上露臉。黑市則古已有之，蓋不自今始了。但盛行於前次世界大戰，而猖獗於這次戰爭。猖獗的程度，厲害過瘟疫，不特通都大邑，是普遍地染上這種疾苦，即窮鄕僻壤，也都毒菌徧佈，漫長滋生，　至今日，其風仍未稍戢。</p>
<p>香港也和其它的城市一樣，幾乎連空氣都變成了黑市。黑市控制整個市塲，黑市滲透了每個市民的血液；每個市民從早上睜開眼起，到晚上再瞌上眼爲止，如其這天不在黑市裏打了一個廻旋，他的生活便有若干的缺憾，也許，其中有的是生活中不可或少的缺憾。</p>
<p>香港在淪陷的時候，黑市歸日本人操縱，黑得像一羣烏鴉，也黑得暗無天日。及至日本人給關進了赤柱，中國人和英國人抄了日本人一套舊文章，又加上些天才的創造，香港黑市便由帝國主義而變爲民主的黑市，也蓬勃了許多，有軍艦載來的舶來品，舶來品幾乎包括了生活所需的一切。然也不過是些軍用品而已。後來連商品的英國貨美國貨都成了黑市了。黑市主宰着人羣，黑市也繁榮了今日的香港。</p>
<p>於是便有了公價，政府說，「超公價便是黑市」。漸漸，就由米糧擴展了它的統制。</p>
<p>——如今港政府聲言，要向黑市進攻，要向黑市決戰。</p>
<p>進攻或者決戰的第一步驟，就是出　「衝鋒車」，大捕黑市小販，小販滿街飛，飛了又復集，復集有黑市，便益發成其爲黑市。第二步驟是處罰黑市商店，商店之　黑市貨者，政府授權法庭或者法官，執行取締黑市條例，賣黑市貨物的商店，初次罰封門停止營業一個月，再則六個月，但以香烟和酒水爲對象，而金城酒家第一個被處罰，然祗是罰款而不封門，爲的它的犯罪在條例公佈之前，法官或者法庭尚未曾得到政府所授予的權限。</p>
<p>但，黑市對於這似乎滿不在乎，進攻是它的進攻，而黑市，到今日還是黑市。</p>
<p>黑市是有組織的，據政府的調查而且公開地說，黑市的組織有間諜網，探知來港貨物的種類，直接向進口商或批發商採辦貨物，但不是强買而是有威脅性的公平交易，公平交易的程度可以使進口商或者批發商得到相當的利潤。黑市黨得到了貨物之後即交給小販去兜售，小販又付黑市黨相當的利潤，而小販取於顧客的又要相當的利潤。這利潤的層層相加，祇有銷費者才感到擔負過重了。</p>
<p>黑市的組織是嚴密而有大力的潛在的，有時公價物品也會給他們控制，那便是公價物品給他們搶光，銷費者祗好求之於黑市。</p>
<p>黑市佔有了香港全部的領域，甚至於領空。在香港的人是從黑市裏透進生活的一切。但香港人有些是漠然的，有些還不知道怎呌做黑市，更有些則去吃黑市。</p>
<p>——吃黑市可就威風了。</p>
<p>更有從黑市裏而去製造另一黑市或者雙料黑貨的，這便是「炒黑市」。</p>
<p>於是世界現在就有兩個象徵，一是「黑市」，另一便是「原子」。</p>
<h3>連環漫畫　三毛從軍紀（六六）</h3>
<p>— 張樂評作</p>
<h3>獃子</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>「所謂獃子」思想家　川白村曾經這樣解　過：「踢開利害打算，而專　不僞不飾的自己本心而動的人，決不是茍且偷安，苟日敷衍就算完事的人，而是能够本質的，澈底地去思紫每一件事物，並且能把答案實現於自己環境的人。能够在燃燒着的生命火焰裏，不斷地在加添着新　的人，所以他也是不意於自我充實的。「像　樣的獃子，在這唯利是圖的社會中，我想一定很少有人願意去做；可是仔細地一想，世界却總是　獃子的獃力量而被不斷的改進的；人類的能够進化到今天這地步，也就因爲有許多大大小小的獃子在拚命幹的緣故，要不，世界眞不知會變成甚麽樣子！</p>
<p>假如世上沒有哥白尼·達爾文以及許多孜孜不倦的獃子，也許世界到現在還在迷信的勢力下被統治着，假如沒有　　這個不怕威權的獃子起來創說民約論、也許老百姓到現在還在封建的勢力下過着非人的生活。假如中國沒有在屢次失敗的革命中犧牲掉的許多獃子，也許我國到現在還不是個民國。不過時代已經變更了，這樣的獃都已成了歷史上的人物了，我們也不必再去期望他們似幽　般的再現，應該大家各自打定主意去從自巴做去，縱然大的獃子够不上，小的獃子總要做，一百分的獃子够不上，六十分的總要。不過千萬不要去做一百二十分的聰明人，你看那些聰明人如汪精衛，如投機的奸商，　能說他們不聰明呀，可是他們對中國對人類個底貢獻了些甚麽？他們的後果又是怎樣？所以我願再尊重的說一遍：「希望大家都能够做個有用的獃子。」獃子越多，中國越有救了，人類也就越進化！</p>
<h3>請英商電車公司　看看人家！</h3>
<p>— 夏健生</p>
<p>在今日紛紛責難及不滿意電車聲中，筆者並不意故意出冷門，誇讚法商電軍，平心而論，確有下列優點：</p>
<p>關於車輛方面：法商二路（一，五，十）電車，在任何站，除了特別原因外，電車一定不出三分鐘就到的，並且三路是順次而來的，除了偶因路途長短之差而參差，但不出十分鐘，你所需要的一路，自會駛來。駛到站後，必定開門，但因車輛容量有限，自有一部乘客被摒除門外，但勿心急，不出十分鐘，必又有你需要的一路來了。</p>
<p>又售票員道德方面：法商也較規矩，從不揩油，但在人十分擁擠或忽忙之間，偶然遺忘，也有的。但經你一提，他立刻找給你，筆者有了多次經騐，決不錯誤。</p>
<p>法商電車的優點，不外由於車子多，調配得當，辦事認眞：我們希望英商電車公司當局：看看人家！</p>
<h3>顧影自憐</h3>
<p>— 長弓</p>
<p>莉莉是位美麗，未婚的護士。自來舍間三次後，我就發現她對鏡子頗有興趣。我擺出「視若無睹」的姿態，暗地裏作了一次有趣的記錄：</p>
<p>我家客堂的一角安置了一只老式的梳妝台，頂中間嵌一面鵝蛋形的鏡子，可以照出半個身子。莉莉一進門，照倒皮包要送到這只台上，然後而對鏡子，邊與房裏的人打招呼，邊用手攏攏撣在兩肩的柔髮。</p>
<p>第二次照鏡子，大約望了十分鐘後。跑到台前，一面伸手從皮包裏摸出一包消治龍，一面望一眼鏡子裏的莉莉，</p>
<p>以後的時間，長短不一；因爲客堂面積太小，我們的莉莉又不慣於長坐。苗條的身子一站，稍移動，就和那面可愛的鏡子拉成了平行綫。莉莉以「臨風楊柳」的姿勢站着撩天，約有三分鐘，而側首斜睨鏡子，就有三次之多。</p>
<p>我的姊姊忽然談到頭髮樣式的種種，當然引起莉莉高度的興趣，索性立到鏡前，比擬足有三分半鐘之久。</p>
<p>姊姊忙着去廚房煮飯，我也悄然走到終日不見亮光的後房去摸索一陣，客堂間祗留莉莉一人了。猛抬頭，從那扇對準鏡台的小窗口望見莉莉正俯身在台上，極盡「顧盼自如」的樂趣。記得在高爾基的一段文章裏讀到：一個人獨處一室時，會縱性發洩一切最天眞可笑的動作，這是一種人類本性的解放。因此我想到這時候的莉莉一定獲得了此種「本性解放」的樂趣。可恨不到二分鐘，姊姊的拖鞋從走廊鞋上饗了過來，莉莉也只得惆悵地重新　進人間的束縛，趕快離開了鏡子。</p>
<p>飯後，洗過臉，莉莉面上的脂粉斑駁不均了，這次是公開而光明的對準鏡面，大施塗抹一番。臨走，當然要拿台上的皮包。拿皮包必然得正視前方，作最後一度親近那面可謂艷福不淺的鏡子，然後姗姗而去。</p>
<p>莉莉來去之間，在舍下一共躭了兩個半小時。</p>
<p>寫到道裏，筆者的記錄責任也算吿一段落。假如讀者有興趣的話，不妨勞神計算一下：莉莉在這兩個半小時內總共照了幾次鏡子？平均幾分鐘一次？如果她這樣繼續下去，總計起來，一生的光陰消磨在鏡子上的，有多少呢？</p>

<h3>邂逅郎靜山先生</h3>
<p>— 凡土</p>
<p>一個炎熱的下午，在新雅二樓會見了名攝影家郎靜山先生。</p>
<p>高高的個子，甯靜的態度，穿一件灰綢的長褂，說話時不露聲色，充分表現出一個有修養的藝術家的風度。</p>
<p>坐定之後記者就問他：「聽說郎先生最近要出國」？</p>
<p>「有這麼一回事，」他微笑着說。「一位美國朋友寫信來請我去演講攝影藝術，對象是他們的P．S．A．就是攝影同志組織的協會，還有許多婦女團體。最近又有榖牌火油公司等預備在十月五日聯合舉辦一次航空攝影的國際比賽，也寫信來請我去做評判員，不過要辦理護照等手續時間上已經來不及，大槪要到明春才能出國。那時候還預備帶一點個人的最新作品去開一次展覽會。」</p>
<p>郎先生拿出幾封他們的來信給記者看，又說他的作品在美國已經展覽過三十幾次了。</p>
<p>對於中國的攝影界，他說缺少的是組織。</p>
<p>「這稱組織無論在國際間的宣傳上，或聯絡感情上都是很需要的。譬如說日本人在這一點上就比我們聰明，他們盡量用照片宣傳他們在戰時所受的損失，因此所得的救濟就比我們優厚得多。反之我們自己呢，却很少有作品在國際間起作用，倒是有些外國人在中國拍了許多照片替我們宣傳！」他拿出一本倫敦出版的中國畫集來，裏面都是些外國攝影家的作品。</p>
<p>他又吿訴記者最近美國方面也有人寫信來向他要關於中國的各方面的照片，他已在設法搜集並且準備聯合攝影界組織成一種學術性的團體。</p>
<p>「最後，」郎先生特別着重的說，「照相材料我們自己不能製造，這是一個很嚴重的問題，尤其過去在抗戰期間，更感到很大的痛苦，所以關於這一點我也在想辦法，至少是不是可以請外商先來幫我們合資經營，然後逐步逐步的達到自力更生。」</p>
<p>記者吿辭的時候，蒙他送了一張最近的作品，是在動物圍攝的一頭雄獅，以峨眉山的背景配合起來。</p>

<h3>National Army Already on Emergency Alert; Communist Army Encircles Jingjiang on Three Routes; Xuyi and Ganquan Town Both Recaptured</h3>

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Military Reorganization; the Government Determines Its Established Policy; Continues to Negotiate Openly with the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] An authoritative source informed our reporter about the crux of the issues in the KMT-CPC political negotiations over the past six months. Since the issuance of the ceasefire order on January 10th, the government has consistently adhered to the ceasefire. However, the Communist Party continued to occupy major cities after January 10th. Although there was a second ceasefire order on June 7th, the Communist army disregarded it and launched large-scale attacks. The government was forced to retaliate in self-defense under unavoidable circumstances. When the reporter inquired about the battles taking place in various parts of Northern Jiangsu, the Communist Party claimed that they were suppressing puppet troops. When asked whether this claim was true, the source replied, "May I ask, were there really puppet troops in Taixing, which the Communist army once occupied?" The Communist Party's statement is clearly a pretext for launching attacks. The reporter further inquired about the issue of administrative power after the Communist army withdraws from Northern Jiangsu. The Communist Party has stated that it can be decided by popular election. The reporter asked whether the government could accept this. The source stated, "The most difficult point in the troop withdrawal issue lies here. Because the Communist side insists on retaining administrative power, it has continued to attack after the ceasefire order. Its purpose is to change the administrative system of each city it occupies, so that its scope expands daily. If it is said that a government elected by the people will be implemented after its withdrawal, then why did it not adopt a method of popular election at the beginning of its occupation, allowing the people to decide whether to retain the original government or change it? Therefore, if the Communist Party withdraws from various regions today, its local administrative power should be restored to the original state when the National Army withdrew. In other words, the Communist Party should actually withdraw its administrative power." The source then stated, "Regarding the issue of military reorganization, it should have started on July 1st, and the numbers were as follows: the government army would be reduced to 90 divisions in the first phase and 50 divisions in the second phase. The Communist Party would be reduced to 18 divisions in the first phase and 10 divisions in the second phase. The progress of this reorganization must be announced to the American side at any time. However, if we look at the government side today (with officer corps everywhere and surplus officers everywhere), it has already reduced its forces from the original 300 divisions to 90 divisions, while the Communist Party has not yet announced its designations and reorganization status. This is the biggest proof that the Communist Party cannot implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. As for the so-called defense zone system, there is actually no such name. It is simply a matter of garrison locations. If the Communist army is reduced to 18 divisions in the future, how many areas should they be garrisoned in, and can it be coordinated with the existing areas? All of this should be discussed." The source finally stated, "Some people have said that all parties are waiting for the Chairman to issue a ceasefire order. In fact, a ceasefire order cannot be issued unilaterally by the government. The Communist Party's willful distortion and propaganda are of no benefit to the negotiations. In the future, the government should continue to negotiate with the greatest sincerity under the established policy, maintain a calm attitude, and not engage in unilateral propaganda, nor be swayed by any propaganda."</p>

<h3>Li Minran Visits Du Zhang Again; Restores the Xiaofengman Power Transmission Line to Shenyang; Li Signs an Agreement with Mayor Dong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 28th Dispatch] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran, visited Chief Du again today for a three-hour discussion. Li also visited Zhang Jia'ao for a discussion of about two hours, and signed an agreement with Mayor Dong on restoring the Xiaofengman power transmission line to Shenyang. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Chief Du.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 28th Dispatch] The electricity supply for Liaoning and Shenyang relied on the Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant. After the Soviet army withdrew, the supply was cut off and the electricity has not been restored to Shenyang. Mayor Dong has discussed this issue twice with Li Minran, the representative of the Communist Party who came to Shenyang, and a concrete solution has been drafted. The power transmission line from Meihekou to Nanlimu, a section of about one hundred kilometers under the control of the Communist Party, has been agreed to be repaired by two teams of technical personnel sent by the government, starting from both ends on August 1st. The safety of the engineering personnel is the sole responsibility of the Communist Party. After the power line is repaired, the Communist army will be responsible for protecting it and will not damage it again. The government will supply electricity to Harbin, Qingyuan, Liuhe, and Jinchuan. The transmission lines to Harbin will be surveyed by personnel from both sides in their respective areas, who will be responsible for repairing them. After all the repairs are completed, electricity transmission will be restored simultaneously in each area. It is estimated that if the damage to the power lines is not significant, the repairs can be completed within two weeks.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping 28th Dispatch] The KMT and CPC representatives of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun Forward Branch have accepted the US representative's proposal to establish a buffer zone in the Songhua River and Hailong areas, with both armies withdrawing to temporarily avoid conflict and facilitate negotiations. It is heard that the establishment of the buffer zone is not intended to be the basis for dividing the garrison areas of the KMT and CPC armies in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Decides to Allocate Supplies to Relieve the Yellow River Disaster in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 28th Dispatch] The Yellow River dikes near the Hetao area of Suiyuan recently breached, causing the river to overflow and flood the surrounding villages, resulting in a severe disaster. It is learned that Fu Zuoyi telegraphed the Executive Yuan requesting relief. As a result, the Executive Yuan decided to allocate relief supplies and medicines for relief. After the supplies are transported by plane, in addition to the supplies, each adult in the disaster area will receive 30,000 yuan in relief money, and each child will receive 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>"Tedious, Tedious"</h3>
<p>Jiang Menglin Tells a Joke; Relieves Reporters from Surrounding Him</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guling 28th Dispatch] Jiang Menglin arrived in Guling this time and was immediately surrounded by reporters, feeling overwhelmed by the endless questions. Therefore, he told the reporters a joke. Jiang said, "Zhu Xi went to see Confucius and wrote on his business card, 'Disciple Zhu Xi Bows a Hundred Times,' adding the explanation, 'Zhu is the surname, Xi is the name, disciple is the student, bowing a hundred times means bowing the head a hundred times.'" Confucius looked at it and kept saying, "Tedious, tedious." Amidst a burst of laughter from the reporters, the interview ended.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang's Life in Lushan is Simple, Elegant, and She Does Not Give Up Work</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu from Our Newspaper in Guling</p>
<p>Almost every day after breakfast, at noon, and as the sun sets and the lights come on, in the misty clouds of Lushan, if you step onto the poetic Jianguo Road, lined with verdant trees and divided by a flowing spring, you will often see the Chairman and Madame, and sometimes Madame Marshall, leisurely strolling, or going out for a ride in a sedan chair, or returning after a tour, or a scene of relaxing in the garden of the Ma Gongguan. Every time I see the happy mood revealed on Madame's face, I feel even more the beauty of this fairyland. Madame Chiang's life on the mountain can be said to be as simple and elegant as the Chairman's, but equally, she has not given up work. Every morning around 7:00 AM, Madame and the Chairman get up together to pray for half an hour. Sometimes, if Madame feels a little unwell or lacks sleep, she will rest for a while after praying. Her breakfast is also very simple, usually two eggs, one or two slices of toast, some fruit, and a cup of cocoa. Madame does not like to drink milk very much. Like the Chairman, she has the same habit of reading the newspaper at breakfast. After breakfast, she either takes a walk with the Chairman nearby, or goes to the opposite door to play chess with Madame Marshall. Then she goes to her private office to handle various important matters related to the women's community. Usually, when there are official English matters, Madame personally drafts the documents and gives them to her secretary, Ms. Chen Chunlian, to organize and type. If it is a Chinese official matter, it is handled by a secretary named Liu Tongzhen. This time, because there is a little free time from official duties on the mountain, only Ms. Chen came. In addition to handling official business, Madame also often writes, and most of her works are sent abroad for publication.</p>
<p>Around 11:00 AM, Madame often goes to the garden to personally supervise the gardeners in arranging flowers and trees. Madame's love for flowers is truly unparalleled. No matter what garden she passes by, if she sees beautiful and lovely flowers, she must stop to admire them. If she can find a way to bring some home, she will be very happy. And she especially pays attention to the art of flower arrangement. She absolutely does not like to stuff a bunch of flowers stiffly into a vase. Therefore, all the flowers in the official residence are arranged by an attendant with artistic talent.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Madame uses this time (after 11:00 AM) to receive guests. The people who are often summoned include Chief Executive Huang Renlin, Military Aide Pi Zonggan, and representatives from the women's community. Mr. and Mrs. Smice, the US Consul General in Tianjin, are also her guests. However, after coming to the mountain, Madame's closest friend is Madame Marshall. Madame's hospitality and sincerity towards Madame Marshall are truly remarkable. Not only did she send her own Western cuisine chef to her place to cook for her, but she also went to the Ma Gongguan almost every noon to have lunch with Madame Marshall. Madame eats more Western food, and she dislikes dishes with a strong fishy smell. At dinner, the Chairman eats two and a half bowls of rice, and sometimes some porridge, but Madame does not like to eat porridge very much. Madame usually drinks clear tea, and always puts two daisies in her tea. She does not drink alcohol often, except when it is necessary to entertain guests. Sometimes, she will go for a picnic to scenic spots at noon.</p>
<p>After lunch, she does not necessarily take a nap every day. Sometimes she talks with Madame Marshall, plays chess, or strolls on the street. When she goes to the street, she likes to look at the items displayed in the shop windows and ask about the prices. Everyone knows that Madame's clothing and supplies are not lacking compared to any lady or miss, but probably few people know the extent of her thrift. Even if a pair of silk stockings is torn, she has to mend it before wearing it again. All the expenses of the official residence, up and down, must be approved by her before they can be processed.</p>
<p>When she walks on the street, she will definitely go up to pat the shoulders, touch the heads of the children, regardless of whether they are poor or rich, and ask them their surnames, what they are called, where they are from, and how old they are. When she sees them dirty, she tells them to go back and wash clean. Madame's loving heart can be seen from this. When strolling, if she comes across fresh corn or other things planted in the fields by the villagers, she will often have the attendants buy some to take home.</p>
<p>From afternoon to evening, she sometimes receives guests, sometimes attends gatherings. If she happens to receive foreign guests, she will serve as the translator. Before dinner, she goes out for a walk with the Chairman or Madame Marshall again. Because Madame Marshall is very lonely here alone, Madame always invites her to dine at her residence together. If the Chairman has guests who need to be talked to at the table, Madame and Madame Marshall will dine separately.</p>
<p>After dinner, if the weather is clear and the moonlight is bright, she will stroll for a while outside the house or in the garden. Madame loves music. There is a piano in the official residence, and when Madame is in a good mood, she will play a piece herself. Music on the radio is also often listened to. She goes to bed around 11:00 PM, and still goes to the office to work for a while before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Madame's clothing on the mountain is sometimes a long cheongsam and sometimes Western trousers. In summer, her preferred colors are light green or blue and white patterns. She rarely wears high heels after going up the mountain, and has already switched to half-high heels for walking. (Sent from Lushan on July 25th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Falls Ill Due to Fatigue; Marshall and Others Visited Him Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guling 28th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart arrived on the mountain on the 27th and immediately felt unwell, but still held three talks with Marshal Marshall and plans to report the results of the talks to the Chairman. According to relevant sources, there was no new development in the ambassador's talks with Zhou Enlai in Nanjing. Zhou only reported the Kunming incident to Ambassador Stuart, wanting to gain Ambassador Stuart's sympathy, and did not discuss political issues. The ambassador expressed his condolences for the tragic deaths of Li and Wen. (The picture shows Ambassador Stuart arriving in Guling. Photo by our reporter Xie Baozhu)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guling 28th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart felt slightly tired after arriving in Guling due to the fatigue of the journey. He rested at the hotel on the 28th and felt a little chilly and feverish at 4 PM. Marshall and Jiang Menglin both visited him, and a government medical officer diagnosed him and found that the ambassador's temperature was slightly high. The ambassador was originally scheduled to have dinner with Chairman Chiang at 7 PM on the 28th, but was unable to attend due to illness. According to Fu Jingbo, an advisor who came to Guling with the ambassador, the ambassador has been very busy since taking office. Just in terms of receiving guests in Nanjing, he receives more than 80 people every day. In addition, he has been traveling back and forth between Nanjing and Guling, which shows how hard he has been working. He will recover after a few days of rest.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Kunming 28th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about and attaches great importance to the murder of Li and Wen in Kunming. After sending Tang Zong, Director of the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior, to Kunming to investigate, he specially sent Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and others to Kunming on a special plane to handle the matter with full authority. After Commander-in-Chief Gu arrived in Kunming, he immediately listened to reports from all sides, made a detailed review, and emphasized that Yunnan Province made great contributions to the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the period of recovery and nation-building, local order needs to be stabilized. He issued a strict order to the military and political organs of Yunnan to be truly responsible for handling the case as soon as possible in order to uphold the law. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Gu plans to inspect the troops stationed in the Southwest along the way after the case is completed.</p>

<h3>共產軍隊在河北北部決堤　楊村各地被淹沒　河北省政府電軍事調處執行部請求制止</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Tianjin, 28th] With the flood season approaching its peak, the Communist army in Hebei Province is widely exploiting the season by digging up riverbanks. Several dikes along the Grand Canal in Wuqing County and near Yangcun have already been breached by Communist forces. The National Army's defense area in Xincheng County along the Daqing River has also been flooded due to the Communist army's deliberate breach of the dikes. Rivers are overflowing incessantly. The Hebei Provincial Government has sent a telegram to the Military Mediation Department, requesting them to intervene and stop these actions.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Beiping, 28th] Sources in transportation circles have learned that the Communist army breached the southern bank of the Majiaqiao dam, located thirteen *li* north of Yangcun west of Tianjin, at 3:00 AM this morning. The floodwaters are flowing south, already inundating several villages. Furthermore, Lutai on the Beining Railway is currently under threat from the Communist army, which has deployed 3,000 troops ten *li* to the north and over 600 troops six *li* to the west.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 27th] Reliable sources confirm that the Communist army east of the Pingbao Line, in order to hinder the restoration of county administration, is taking advantage of the heavy flooding of the Daqing and Fu Rivers to breach their dikes. Detailed information obtained from relevant sources is as follows: (1) The Baigou Town (70 *hua li* southeast of Gaobeidian Station) area, located between Xincheng and Rongcheng counties on the east bank of the Daqing River, has long been occupied by Communist forces. Recently, due to heavy flooding, the Xincheng County Brigade of the Chinese Communist Party led local laborers to breach the eastern bank of the river one *li* north of the town. The water is spreading southeast, intending to obstruct the military and administrative restoration work in Xiong County. Currently, dozens of villages in the Biantang area southeast of Xincheng, the northern and eastern districts of Xiong County, and the southwestern part of the county are completely submerged, resulting in widespread misery and crop failure. (2) The Communist Brigade stationed inside Anxin County City supervised local laborers to breach the northern dike of the Fu River. The breach is located at the Laohetou Village in Anxin County. The water flow is significant, and the area north and east of Dongan Town (30 *li* east of Baoding) in Qingyuan County, as well as villages and towns in northern Anxin, are now a vast expanse of water. Autumn crops have been destroyed, houses have collapsed, and villagers are homeless, creating a truly tragic situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 27th] The water level in the old course of the Yellow River within Xuzhou City is rising sharply. Investigation reveals this is due to mountain torrents. Jinpu Town has already been flooded. The city government and police department are actively supervising the construction of dikes.</p>
<h3>A Legendary News Story: The Disappearance of Sun Zhongyuan – Abducted but then Calling the Garrison Command Himself – Police Found Sun at the Address Given in a Private Residence</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Beiping, 28th] Regarding the disappearance of Sun Zhongyuan, a member and spokesperson of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, this reporter has learned from reliable sources the following account of this legendary event: Sun Zhongyuan went out with his sister at 4:00 PM on the 18th and was abducted by a car that came up from behind. Subsequently, the Beiping branch of the Democratic League reported the case, requesting the Beiping City authorities to investigate. Zhang Dongsun intended to host a press conference to explain the situation, but this did not materialize. Then, the Beiping Garrison Command suddenly received a phone call. The caller said, "I am Sun Zhongyuan. Please come to a certain location to protect me." The Garrison Command immediately dispatched personnel, who indeed found Sun in a private residence with three or four women present. Upon questioning, Sun first asked, "Can you guarantee my safety?" The reply was: "Yes!" Sun then produced two letters he had written in advance, one addressed to a certain news agency and the other to a certain newspaper. The letter to the newspaper also included a letter for the Beiping负责人 (person in charge) of the Democratic League. The letter to the news agency stated that, having seen reports that the Democratic League seemed to be using him as a propaganda tool, he wished to declare that "I (Sun referring to himself) am not a member of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic League. I only participated in the Democratic League in order to strive for democracy, peace, and unification." The letter to the newspaper was similar in content. The letter to the Beiping负责人 of the Democratic League expressed dissatisfaction with the Democratic League's advocacy for the Communist Party. At this point, Sun still did not explain the reasons for the incident but repeatedly questioned the Garrison Command personnel in a tense tone: "How can you guarantee my safety?" The Garrison Command personnel replied that, to ensure absolute safety, he (Sun) should petition Director Li Zongren. Upon hearing this, Sun was greatly alarmed, believing that the individuals who came to protect him were not specifically guaranteeing his safety, and promptly fainted, losing consciousness. The Garrison Command personnel have already requested a doctor to administer a stimulant injection and are providing protection. Further developments will depend on Sun's recovery. The letters to the news agency and newspaper will only be released after a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Luo Longji Discusses "Neutrality," Saying Zhang Lan Misunderstood Its Meaning</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Regarding the internal disputes within the Democratic League, Luo Longji stated: "Zhang Lan has misunderstood the meaning of my 'neutrality.' In terms of the party's position, the Democratic League should remain neutral between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, what I mean by not being able to be neutral is in relation to the civil war.

<h3>Whereabouts of Former Manchukuo Empress Qiuhong Unknown</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 27th] Since the Japanese surrender, the whereabouts of the former Manchukuo Empress Qiuhong have been unknown. A former attendant of Puyi from 通化 (Tonghua) claims that, following the Soviet air raid on Puyi, the family and servants fled to Dali Village in Linjiang County, then to Tonghua. He claims that Qiuhong has always been nearby since then. It is said that three days before the Japanese surrender, on August 12th, Puyi fled with his family and about sixty palace attendants to Dali Village in Linjiang County after Soviet planes bombed 通化. Puyi then flew to the northeast but was captured by the Soviet army midway. At that time, Qiuhong and others remained in Linjiang. In January of this year, when the Communist army captured Linjiang, they were detained and stripped of their jewelry, Tang and Song calligraphy, and various jade and precious stones. These jewels were worth about 200 million流通劵 (circulation notes). After being imprisoned in Linjiang for two months, they were sent to 通化, but many of the attendants had been scattered. Only seventeen people went to 通化. After the Communist army captured Changchun, a certain political commissar took them to Changchun on April 29th, but three days later they were transferred to Yongji. At this time, only Qiuhong, Puyi's sister-in-law, and their children were traveling together. A few days before the National Army entered Yongji, they were sent back to 通化, but dispersed on the way. Their whereabouts are now unknown. The attendant also said that Qiuhong and Puyi had a poor relationship. Qiuhong was thin and addicted to opium, and her nerves were often unstable.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Wishing the European Peace Conference Success!</h3>
<p>The European Peace Conference opens today at the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. Representatives from twenty-one countries are attending. The opening address will be given by the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Our country’s Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and diplomatic envoys stationed abroad are also participating. This is the first peace conference after the war, and its main purpose is to clean up the aftermath of the war in Europe. People all over the world who yearn for peace are expressing their deep expectations for this European Peace Conference with joy. The biggest task of this conference is to sign peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, so that a part of war-torn Europe can return to peace as soon as possible. Therefore, the significance of this conference is significant and cannot be compared to ordinary international conferences. When U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes boarded a special plane in Washington to fly to Paris, President Truman held a farewell ceremony for him, wishing the conference success, and earnestly urged: "The American people are determined to fully support a just and reasonable peace based on the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter." This gives Byrnes not only a supreme principle to adhere to when attending the conference to discuss European issues but also a reliable backing in case of disputes with representatives from other countries.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since the European war ended with the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. During this period, politicians and diplomats from various countries have exhausted their wisdom and ability to repeatedly convene international conferences, such as the Potsdam Big Three Conference, the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, all in order to enable the European countries after the war to return to their normal state as soon as possible, and the people who have suffered from the war can also escape from the fire and water and ascend to a comfortable seat as soon as possible. However, after twists and turns and exhaustive efforts for more than a year, this European Peace Conference could finally be convened. The difficulty of creating world peace is really no less than striving for victory in wartime.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future of the European Peace Conference today, we must not be pessimistic just because it is not easy to create peace. The more difficult it is to obtain something in the world, the more precious it feels. We believe that human conscience will overcome various difficulties and achieve final success in striving for peace. After the great disaster, the people of all countries in the post-war world deeply reflect on the pain and yearn for peace. It can be said that everyone has the same heart and the same principle. As long as there are no more Hitlers, Mussolinis, or Tojos who suffer from the delusion of "ruling the world", then we dare to say that the scourge of world war will not rise again, and permanent peace will surely be realized one day. There is really no reason to be "discouraged" or "disappointed" at this moment. As long as everyone has determination and a sense of justice, and for this conference, "only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed," then the outcome of this conference will surely sow many seeds of peace in Europe and will also make a considerable contribution to the entire world peace.</p>
<p>However, creating peace is everyone's common goal, but how to achieve the goal of peace has indispensable preconditions:</p>
<p>First, the creation of world peace should adopt democratic methods, because the people of all countries in the post-war world hope that the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy, and they all agree that true world peace cannot be achieved until international democracy is realized. Looking back at modern history, the outbreak of international wars has always been the result of the evil of international power politics. And observing the relations between countries in the past year, there is still only a rebalancing of "power," and all issues are determined by "power" factors. Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union are competing for hegemony, especially the Soviet Union and the United States each have their subjective world policies, while Britain vacillates between the two, hoping to maintain its important status as a powerful country in the rebalancing of "power." This European Peace Conference may be an excellent opportunity for power politics to display its magical powers. If this style cannot be changed, and everyone only recognizes "power" and ignores "reason," and still believes that "power is reason," and only regards the conference as a banquet for entertaining guests, and all issues are determined by a few powerful countries, and even the agenda is not allowed to be discussed and decided by everyone, and the representatives of general weak and small countries only take this opportunity to visit Paris, dance, or attend cocktail parties and tea parties, then the future of the conference may not live up to the expectations of the world. To realize the principle of international democracy, we believe that the "veto power" of the minority controlling the majority should be abolished to avoid abuse.</p>
<p>Second, when discussing any issue at the conference, the representatives of all countries should base their opinions on international justice, without any malicious intent of revenge, and then a reasonable and fair solution can be sought. Only in this way can it be done once and for all. Otherwise, only seeking the present and ignoring the future; or only seeking one's own pleasure and not thinking about whether others can bear it; or only knowing temporary compromise and abandoning principles, these are not thorough and fundamental solutions, and they cannot establish a century-long plan for human peace. President Truman said that the United States supports a fair peace based on the two major charters. This sentence has profound meaning and deserves the common consideration of the twenty-one national representatives attending the conference. The peace treaty after the First World War is our lesson.</p>
<p>In short, it is certainly not easy to create world peace, but by accumulating the common efforts of mankind, it will surely succeed. The convening of this conference is another step towards peace. We should happily wish the conference success, and at the same time insist on international democracy and justice as the supreme principles for creating peace, and urge the representatives of all countries to abide by them so that this world can truly enter a new era of peace and democracy.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th Special Dispatch] The Peace Conference with the participation of twenty-one countries will open at the Luxembourg Palace at 4 p.m. tomorrow, writing the first chapter of peace after World War II. Its task is strictly limited to discussing the draft treaties with the former German allies Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. This conference will not discuss the issues of Germany, Austria, or Japan. Several country peace conferences will be opened later for discussion. The general public attaches great importance to this Paris Peace Conference, as this will be a precedent for future peace conferences.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is unable to attend the opening ceremony of the Peace Conference in Paris due to health reasons. Prime Minister Attlee will personally attend instead. Other attending representatives include Sea Minister Alexander, Foreign Secretary McNeil, and Treasury Financial Secretary Hall. Bevin has been ordered by his doctor to rest for at least one week. During the Prime Minister's absence, Lord President Morrison will act as Prime Minister. According to the agency's diplomatic correspondent, the opening phase of the Paris Peace Conference may not involve issues that require Bevin's special experience. The treaties of the five countries have been largely agreed upon, and Britain's attitude has already been clearly expressed. However, the issues of Germany, Austria, and Palestine may be discussed outside the conference at the same time, and Bevin's rich experience seems especially indispensable when discussing the German issue.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: According to the London Foreign Office, the directive regarding the indefinite cancellation of the publication of the clauses of the draft treaties of the five countries Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria will be issued from London this afternoon, stating that any part of the treaty must be published from Paris. The Soviet Union had previously agreed to publish the parts of the treaty that had been agreed upon, but suddenly overturned the previous agreement last night.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that the Council of Foreign Ministers has decided not to publish the full text of the treaties of the five countries Italy, Finland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, speculating that the reason must be that the U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and France "failed to reach an agreement on what should be published and what should not be published." The parts of the full text of the treaty that have been agreed upon by the four countries were handed over to the press yesterday, scheduled to be published at 11 p.m. today. This permission has now been revoked.</p>
<h3>Wishing That All Countries Show Sincerity to Establish World Peace Byrnes Issues Statement Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Byrnes addressed a crowd of 2,000 welcomers at the airport this afternoon before departing for Paris, stating that the United States will never return to a policy of isolation. He said that the situation today is completely different from when World War I ended. There are no longer conflicts between government departments within our country, but rather a state of working together with one heart. The world cannot trust a divided United States. I hope that the first set of treaties can be signed at the end of this conference. Peace must come from the heart of mankind to be effective. President Truman wished Byrnes success on this trip and told him that the United States will be the backing of the United Nations, hoping to establish peace based on the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. The British and French ambassadors also saw Byrnes off at the airport.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast a declaration by Secretary of State Byrnes before attending the Paris Peace Conference, stating that the United States is determined to make this conference the beginning of peace efforts and will never let it be the end of peace work. He also said that the hope of avoiding a new war of terror depends on whether the causes of friction left over from the war can be eliminated. He said, after months of effort, I feel that we have stepped onto the path of peace. In a world where countries jealously safeguard their sovereignty, there is no real peace-making process. Making peace requires seeking compromise, and the progress made so far is also the result of compromise. Before the task is completed, compromise must continue, but this so-called compromise refers to reconciling honest conflicts of opinion, not obtaining selfish benefits for oneself or others. Today, we should not only help make peace but also make it an effective peace. We should cooperate with various countries to establish peace and develop peace.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Speaks in London</h3>
<p>Creating World Peace</p>
<p>Should Adopt Democratic Methods</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, the head of the delegation attending the Peace Conference, arrived in Southampton, England, from New York and said that the goal of the Australian delegation is to obtain a reasonable and democratic peace, and it must be determined that democratic methods should be adopted to create peace, not only limited to the Paris Peace Conference. Afterwards, democratic methods should also be adopted in the relationship between Germany, Austria, and Japan. The Australian representatives will do their best to contribute to peace, so that they can be on par with the achievements of the Australian army, navy, and air force in various war zones during this war. Australia and Britain have an inseparable relationship because they share the same king and the same race, and they depend on each other for life. This has been fully demonstrated in the first and second world wars. For this reason, we have a direct interest in European issues. In short, Australia's main interest lies in the Pacific because it seeks a lasting solution based on justice and democracy.

<h3>Conference Agenda</h3>
<p>First Discuss the Treaty of Italy</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] The New York Times today carried a dispatch from Paris stating that the Treaty of Italy may be listed as the first item on the conference agenda. This treaty can prove that although the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached an agreement on many important points, it is not unanimous on other points or remains to be decided, and will ask the conference for instructions. The content of the treaty is definitely a draft rather than a treaty. The four powers have largely agreed on the Italian border, but there are still other proposals, such as the Italian-Yugoslav border line proposed by Yugoslavia and the free leadership of Italian Autriche Trieste. Although the four powers have agreed to Italy's reparations to the Soviet Union, they have not agreed on what kind of reparations should be given to France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Abyssinia. Although the special port has agreed to be managed internationally, the status of its government has not been determined. Although it has been agreed to postpone the decision on the Italian colonies in North Africa and East Africa for one year, the solution is not clearly stated in the draft.</p>
<h3>Japanese Defense Lawyer of the International Court Plans to Submit a Secret Telegram Proving Roosevelt Knew of the Breakup Early</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] A United Press reporter exclusively learned today that during the trial of Japanese war criminals here, the Japanese defense lawyers may use a Japanese secret telegram to prove that President Roosevelt and former Secretary of State Hull knew as early as November 28, 1941, that Japan had determined to make the peace talks break down. This news was revealed to the United Press alone by a defense lawyer, but he was unwilling to announce his name. The purpose of the defense lawyers' plan is to prove that senior U.S. officials should not be too surprised by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This person also said that U.S. military officers intercepted and deciphered a coded telegram sent by Japan from Tokyo to Washington on November 28, 1941, in which the Japanese government told the "peace envoys" sent to Washington that the negotiations would break down in two or three days. It is said that this telegram was deciphered on the same day after it was intercepted. If this telegram had been used, it would have been used as the basis for defensive work, because both the U.S. and Japan knew that war was coming, and Roosevelt and Hull pretended not to know, so that Japan took this action first. The United Press reporter further learned that this telegram expressed admiration for the "superhuman efforts" made by the Japanese representative sent to Washington, Mr. Gu, to achieve peace; but pointed out that the U.S. counter-proposal was too humiliating to Japan and could not be accepted. The Japanese diplomatic representatives sent to Washington learned from this telegram that they would soon receive the Imperial Government's views on the U.S. proposal in two or three days. The negotiations to this point will in fact be broken. It is said that the telegram stated that this situation was inevitable, but warned the representatives not to create the impression that the negotiations had broken down before the official note arrived.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vatican, 27th] The "Italian Daily" published a news story today with a large headline, saying that Pope Pius XII plans to contact the Paris Peace Conference and appeal to the future peace treaty to be inspired by Christian doctrines. Former Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI also interfered in the same way in 1917. Officials here do not believe that the Pope will take this action at present, because the Pope has repeatedly called attention to investigating the responsibility of those who are not inspired by Christian doctrines and put the fate of mankind in danger. At the same time, according to the "Evening News," the Papal Secretariat of State has been reorganized and a Papal Secretary of State has been appointed. Officials pointed out that this matter has been mentioned some time ago, and the reorganization is within expectations.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th Special Dispatch Delayed] The Siamese Ministry of Interior recently issued an order stating that overseas Chinese who were accused of participating in anti-Japanese activities under the Siamese dictator Phibul government in 1939 should be formally given a decision not to prosecute. This order affects more than 2,000 overseas Chinese, most of whom are wealthy businessmen. The reasons for the declaration of innocence are: (1) The case has been shelved for several years, and according to Siamese criminal law, it can be regarded as overdue, so it cannot be prosecuted. (2) Since the Japanese surrendered last year, all cases related to anti-Japanese activities have been abolished.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The Far East correspondent of the Sunday Observer said that the establishment of the Republic of the Philippines is only two weeks old, while the U.S. military is launching a large-scale suppression of guerrillas in central Luzon Island. This is a bad start for the Philippine Republic. There are about 10,000 of these guerrillas, and their weapons were obtained from the U.S. military during the war of resistance.

<h3>Old Man's Lament: Loudly Exhorting: Yuan Xiluo Fasts for Three Days: Advocates Dietary Restrictions to Aid Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: Plans to Fly to Yan'an for Final Admonition</h3>
<p>Yuan Xiluo, a respected elder and educational pioneer in Jiangsu Province, recently went to Zhenjiang to attend a fundraising meeting for refugees in northern Jiangsu and visited refugee relief centers. Deeply saddened, he decided to fast for three days, donating the food saved during those three days to aid the refugees in northern Jiangsu. He also appealed to the elders in the counties south of the Yangtze River to embrace a compassionate spirit and actively donate to help. At the same time, he sent a telegram to Mao Zedong and Zhu De, imploring them to prioritize the people's lives and respect public opinion by promptly withdrawing the communist forces from northern Jiangsu, so that displaced compatriots could return to their hometowns as soon as possible. He also plans to borrow a plane in the coming days to fly directly to Yan'an and offer a final admonition through fasting. The original text of Yuan's handwritten letter and telegram are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhu and Mao Requesting a Prompt Withdrawal of Troops</p>
<p>Shanghai Central News Agency and all newspaper offices forward to Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhu De in Yan'an: Last November, Xiluo and fourteen elders in Shanghai jointly sent a telegram urging both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease hostilities. They pointed out that your army's destruction of railways was disrupting the flow of goods, leading to the suffering of the people who were without food and clothing and freezing to death. They planned to fly to Yan'an to dissuade your army from destroying the railways through fasting. Chairman Chiang did not allow the dispatch of a plane to send me to Yan'an because I was old, so Zhu Chengxing did not go. It has been eight months since then. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not succeeded, and conflicts continue. The 31 counties and cities of northern Jiangsu Province, with a population of 20 million, have suffered immensely from the enemy and puppet regimes during the War of Resistance, enduring extreme pain. In the eleven months since the victory, they have been subjected to the "struggle" and "confession" campaigns carried out by your party's military and political personnel, as well as the conscription of young men for the party's conflicts, leading to the destruction of families and widespread fear. In recent months, hundreds of thousands of people have fled to Xuzhou, Haizhou, Nantong, Taizhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and areas south of the Yangtze River. Xiluo went to Zhenjiang the other day and visited these refugee relief centers. Although the government and charitable people have donated money for relief, with millions of refugees, the daily need for rice is ten thousand stones, which is beyond their capacity. Therefore, the refugee camps are no different from hell on earth, where everyone is emaciated, barely clothed, and without resources for medical treatment when ill. Deaths are a common and unbearable sight. I have now decided to abstain from food for three days, donating the money saved to aid the refugees, and I am informing people in the counties south of the Yangtze River to join in this effort, fasting for one day each and using the money to aid the refugees. I earnestly request the two gentlemen to promptly withdraw your army from northern Jiangsu, so that the millions of displaced compatriots can return to their hometowns in the autumn and not freeze or starve to death. Do not let the people's resentment deepen, leading to your party's ultimate abandonment by the people. Nowadays, weapons are becoming more sophisticated, and the world has entered the atomic age. If you indulge in war to harm the country, it will inevitably lead to national demise and extinction. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, brothers from the same ancestor. If you fight for territory, causing people to die in the crossfire or be displaced and starve to death, it is truly fratricide. In February of this year, Xiluo wrote about Confucius's "Great Unity" and gave it to Mr. Zhou Enlai to send to the two gentlemen. Please read it carefully, as it contains the golden words of Chinese sages for saving humanity through public ownership. I hope you will adopt this principle and work with the people of the whole country to save China and the world. Xiluo plans to borrow a plane in the coming days to fly to Yan'an and engage with the two gentlemen through fasting. This telegram is sent in advance. Yuan Xiluo sends this telegram with deep emotion.</p>
<p>Appeal to the Elders for Widespread Sympathy</p>
<p>To the elders, brothers, and sisters in the counties south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and to the elders, brothers, and sisters in Nanjing and Shanghai: On July 20th, Xiluo went to Zhenjiang. On the afternoon of July 21st, he attended a fundraising meeting for refugees in northern Jiangsu and visited refugee relief centers. He listened to the reports of refugee representatives and realized that the people of northern Jiangsu, due to the extraordinary actions of the communist military and political personnel, had lost all their property and could not guarantee their lives, forcing them to leave their homes and seek refuge in Xuzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and surrounding areas. The relief of refugees in the refugee relief centers requires a massive amount of rice and flour. For 1.2 million people, 6,000 stones of rice or 600,000 catties of flour are needed daily. Although the government allocates funds and enthusiastic people donate, the amount is often insufficient. Therefore, the refugee camps are no different from hell on earth. The refugees are emaciated, and clothing is even more scarce. Fortunately, it is summer, so they will not freeze to death, but children are mostly naked, while adults must cover their lower bodies, using tattered cotton-padded jackets and trousers for covering, with no summer clothes in good condition. If they are sick, they lack medical resources and can only wait for death. Currently, the number of refugees whose names have been investigated is 600,000 in Xuzhou, including those who fled from Shandong and Henan, 500,000 in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and surrounding counties and cities, 100,000 in Nantong, and an estimated 3 million or more who are not in refugee centers but live with relatives and friends, or rent houses and live by begging in the countryside. Xiluo has witnessed and heard this and feels extremely saddened for these compatriots who have fled from communism. Recalling November 5th of last year, when the communist army prevented the National Army from carrying out the government's orders to take over lost territories and disarm the surrendered Japanese army, they destroyed the railways, fearing that not only would the National Army not be able to take over the lost territories, but also that the flow of goods would be disrupted, leading to the starvation of the people. Xiluo and fourteen elders in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chongqing and Yan'an, urging them to stop the internal conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Xiluo telegraphed his old friend Wu Zhihui, asking Chairman Chiang to send a plane to Shanghai to take me to Yan'an to dissuade Mao Zedong and Zhu De's extraordinary actions through fasting. Wu Zhilao did not agree with my fasting and did not send a plane, so I could not realize my plan to fast in Yan'an. Now, Xiluo has decided not to eat for three days, donating the food saved during those three days to aid the refugees from northern Jiangsu. Xiluo respectfully requests the elders, brothers, and sisters in the counties south of the Yangtze River, Nanjing, and Shanghai to support this effort, abstaining from food for one day each and using the food saved to aid the refugees from northern Jiangsu. The value of one day's food can be converted into cash and deposited in a nearby bank, which can be remitted to the Jiangsu Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Such merit will be a hundred times greater than burning incense and chanting Buddha's name. I humbly wish you all good health. Seventy-one-year-old Yuan Xiluo respectfully declares, July 26th.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association Provides Relief to Displaced Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association convened a meeting on the 26th to provide relief to displaced youth, passing four important resolutions: (1) The procedure for distributing funds to students will be as follows: The school will identify students from northern Jiangsu in each class, create three copies of the roster, and appoint a representative to oversee the distribution together with personnel from relevant authorities. Students must also appoint a representative to assist in the handling of the disbursement. When receiving funds, students must bring their student ID card and seal, and follow the prescribed procedures. The use of funds received by students is limited to maintaining meals. Funds transferred to the cafeteria or bank will be handled by the school. (2) The amount of funds for student relief during the summer vacation will be 20,000 yuan per student per month, mainly to maintain meals. (3) Medical and other expenses for students who become ill will be handled by the office. (4) A "Temporary Student Relief Committee of the Shanghai Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association" will be established to handle future student relief matters. Hu Shenzheng, Fu Haiqiu, Lu Ticheng, and thirteen others were elected as committee members, with Lu Ticheng as the convener. Necessary office expenses for the committee will be allocated by the office.</p>
<h3>Can All Salaried Individuals in the City Donate One Day's Income?</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association received a letter yesterday from an enthusiastic person, proposing to appeal to all civil servants and other salaried compatriots in the city to donate one day's income (applicable to all those with a fixed monthly income). According to statistics, there are approximately one million such salaried individuals, and the average daily income per person is at least 3,000 yuan, totaling over 3 billion yuan. The committee is currently considering this proposal.</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs Encourages Returning Technical Personnel at Reception: Should Acknowledge Domestic Difficulties and Prepare to Cope: Use Valuable Experience to Assist in Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Vice Minister Bei Zheng, Pan Xulun, and others held a tea party at the Bank Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to receive a total of 114 members of the first batch of technical personnel sent to the United States by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for internships. Zhang Zijian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and Chief Secretary Guo Keshu, among others, also attended. Minister Wang delivered a speech, stating: "I am very pleased to hold this tea party with you today. You were scheduled for a year to return home after completing your studies and participate in various wartime production tasks. Now that our country has won the War of Resistance, you will participate in postwar reconstruction work. The sudden arrival of this victory has made the people feel happy, but our country's preparation for postwar reconstruction was not sufficient. Therefore, there have been many uncoordinated phenomena after the victory. Taking industry as an example, the recession seems to be even more severe than during the war. However, this is an inevitable phenomenon of transitioning from wartime to a stage of peace. Generally, when transitioning from peace to wartime, people's minds tend towards hard work and endurance. Therefore, all difficulties, which are not easy to solve in the first place, can also be solved. However, transitioning from wartime to peace is different. People's minds generally tend towards excessive optimism. As a result, the reconstruction work that should have been done with redoubled efforts has suddenly been relaxed. Therefore, disappointment is expected and there is no need to be pessimistic. You have spent a year interning abroad, familiarizing yourself with the industrial facilities in foreign countries. Upon suddenly returning home, you may feel that all the facilities of domestic industry are uncoordinated, making it impossible to fully utilize what you have learned. However, before going abroad, you had been working in the industrial sector for many years, so you should be different from ordinary students studying abroad. I hope you will not view things too simplistically, lest you feel disappointed if you encounter setbacks. Therefore, there are two points that I expect from you now: (1) I deeply hope that you will recognize the various difficulties in our country, first study the details of the difficulties, and prepare to cope with them, so that you will not feel disappointed. (2) You have spent a year interning abroad and have seen how American industry transitioned from wartime to peacetime. The United States had prepared for postwar reconstruction early on and has rich experience. Therefore, I hope you will take these</p>
<p>Valuable Experience: Combine with National Conditions</p>
<p>Implement it into our country's reconstruction work. As for the issue of your service after returning home, during this reconstruction period, when various agencies need technical personnel, you should be able to find your place and do your best. According to the internship subjects, the dispatched personnel are divided into nine groups. I hope each group will elect a representative to report on the experience of going abroad for the internship." Subsequently, Vice Minister Xiao Zheng stood up and gave a speech, stating: "I would like to supplement Minister Wang's comments with a few words. I hope everyone will work hard to build China into a prosperous and strong country. In the past, our country was an economically invaded country. After this war, it jumped from a semi-colony to a world-class power. For the time being, let's put aside the victory or defeat on this battlefield, but the actual economic and industrial victory has not been achieved. The lessons of the eight-year War of Resistance show us that if our country wants to become prosperous and strong, we must work hard to build the foundation of economic and industrial development. Looking at countries like Britain and the United States, with economic foundations and industrial positions, they still need to go through a considerable period of time to complete reconstruction after a war. And our country</p>
<p>Economic Foundation: Always Fragile</p>
<p>Reconstruction work cannot be completed overnight. Therefore, the Central Government has already discussed a five-year reconstruction plan before the victory, aiming to build our country's economic strength in the fastest possible time. This plan has not been fully disclosed to society, but it is a preliminary plan to set a good economic path for our country. You are divided into nine groups to go abroad for internships, all in line with the needs of this plan. The foundation of this plan has two parts: (1) Build national transportation, (2) Build basic industries. Once these two departments are completed, we can gradually talk about the development of other light industries. However, even for these two departments, tens of thousands of specialized talents are needed. The government, in view of the drawbacks of the past laissez-faire study abroad system, has dispatched you based on this five-year plan. Therefore, I hope: (1) How to systematically coordinate you under the original plan, so that you can all use your strengths and serve the country. (2) I hope you will adhere to your respective positions and work hard under the premise of the entire country, in accordance with the original intention of the weaving family to send you, and cooperate with the needs of the country to complete this construction plan. In recent years, the economic systems of various countries have shifted from liberalism to planned economies. Britain and the United States all feel the need to assist a country's economic construction with the strength of politics and the state. Our country's economic system is centered on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and economic construction is also advancing in an organized and planned manner. Therefore, there should be no competition between state-owned and private enterprises, but mutual cooperation and development. I deeply hope that everyone can work together in accordance with this principle, then the development of our country's economy will have great prospects." The representative of the students, Mr. Huang Zhenxun</p>
<p>Delivered a response, Huang thanked Minister Wang and Vice Ministers Xiao and Pan on behalf of all the students for their kind invitation to the tea party. He also stated: "After returning home this time, with the guidance of the officials, we will not be at a loss. We feel that the wisdom of our people is no less than that of foreigners. However, American workers are mostly well-led, strictly managed, and live very stable lives, so they can work with peace of mind. We urge the government to ensure a stable life for all personnel who have completed their studies and returned home, so that they will of course do their best to assist in national construction."</p>
<p>Finally, Cai Jiali of the Electricity Group, Feng Zipei of the Mechanical Group, Meng Xiqian of the Electrical Group, Wu Tongzhao of the People's Livelihood Chemical Group, Wang Liang of the Management Group, Su Xianjie of the Textile Group, and Lu Yuanyong of the Oil Refining Group respectively reported on the internship experiences of their respective groups. The following are excerpts of the major points: Advantages of American Factories: (1) Detailed division of labor, close cooperation, flexible organization, and easy coordination and application. (2) Personnel system is very regular. (3) Production control is very perfect. (4) Management technology has a long history. (5) Production costs are highly concerned. (6) Wages are very low, for example, cotton textile workers earn 70 cents per hour, and their lives are very stable. (7) Workers' education and knowledge are improving day by day. In addition to the above advantages, the members felt that there were some large factories that were reluctant to disclose information due to the nature of their products and foreign trade relations. It is hoped that in the future, when the government sends personnel abroad to study, all aspects should be coordinated and complete.</p>

<h3>The Alarm Rang for a Long Time: Citizens Were Startled: It Turned Out the Wire Was Broken</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 6:45 PM yesterday, the alarms in the Taishan and Huangpu districts of the city suddenly rang for a continuous ten minutes. The general public had not heard this mournful sound for a long time, and its sudden arrival startled everyone. At that time, a civilian airliner happened to fly over the city, making nervous people even more imaginative. Later, the police station notified Xinhua Merchant Bank to investigate the cause. It was reported that underground wire No. 108 in the Jiangxi Road area was damaged due to accumulated water and humidity, causing the alarms in the two districts to ring on their own. Personnel were immediately dispatched to repair it.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, and Others Jointly Petition to Designate August 8th as Father's Day; All Children Should Wear Red and White Flowers on This Day in Remembrance</h3>
<p>The establishment of Father's Day in China truly began on August 8th of last year, initiated by ten Shanghai leaders: Yan Huiqing, Yuan Xilian, Shi Zhifu, Mei Lanfang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yiqu, Chen Qingshi, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhhe, and Fu Wenshou. At that time, it was during the final battle of the Far East, with the enemy rampant and the environment perilous. Their resolute initiative to establish Father's Day was, in reality, an implicit commemoration of the motherland. People in Shanghai responded unanimously, holding enthusiastic celebrations that were deeply inspiring. Recently, ten prominent figures from various circles, including Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, Song Hanzhang, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Zhihui, Li Denghui, and Qian Yongming, felt that this initiative represented a pure expression of national righteousness during the war of resistance and deserved to be widely promoted. Furthermore, just as the United States initiated Mother's Day after World War I, our country initiated Father's Day after World War II. This parallel brilliance, especially at a time of amicable Sino-American relations, felt deeply meaningful. Therefore, based on the original proposal, they jointly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to forward the request to the central government, seeking approval to designate August 8th as Father's Day and issue a nationwide circular for its implementation. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau issued a response, stating: "Received the petition, approval granted to proceed accordingly, and permission is granted to forward the petition to the Ministry of Social Affairs for nationwide circulation and compliance. Be informed accordingly, this is the order." The original petition is now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted: It is hereby noted that ten leaders from various circles in Shanghai, including Yan Huiqing, Yuan Xilian, Shi Zhifu, Mei Lanfang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yiqu, Chen Qingshi, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhhe, and Fu Wenshou, initiated Father's Day on August 8th of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic (1945) and issued a statement of origin, stating: "Recalling that at the end of the First European War, Ms. Jarvis of the United States initiated Mother's Day, aiming to comfort the mothers of those who died in battle. Subsequently, capable people from countries around the world actively promoted it, transforming it into a commemoration of one's own mother.</p>
<p>Regardless of place, time, or culture, the idea of cherishing one's elders is the same. However, the father gave me life, and the mother nurtured me. Zhang Hengqu inscribed the father's heaven and the mother's earth with gratitude, and Liu Meixiao explored the father's worries and the mother's hardships. Father and mother should be equally esteemed and regarded. Knowing only the father and not the mother goes against the common feelings of humanity. Knowing only the mother and not the father is a truly heartbreaking matter! We, the undersigned, as the Second European War comes to an end, are reminded of this and hereby jointly initiate Father's Day, designating every August 8th for respectful celebrations, also known as the Double Eighth Festival.</p>
<p>The double eighths connected resemble the Chinese character for 'father' (父), and the pronunciation is similar to 'baba' (爸爸), making it easy to remember. The ceremony imitates the precedent of Mother's Day. All children wear flowers in remembrance. Those with living fathers wear a red flower, while those whose fathers have passed away wear a white flower, showing respect and performing rituals to the fullest extent. The love of the red sun will shine forever, and the grief of losing one's protector will preserve the pure family tradition. Who does not have parents? Who does not have children? Hearing of this initiative will surely evoke empathy. It is hoped that social leaders will promote and implement it, from one family to one village, to one county, to one province, to one country, and to the entire world. May the gratitude to one's parents be universally unified. This is what we all earnestly and sincerely wish for." These words have been published in various Shanghai newspapers. However, the enemy publication "New Shenbao" refused to publish them, precisely because the initiation of Father's Day was an expression of national consciousness, and the initiators, such as Yan Huiqing, were all known for their unwavering loyalty. It was natural for them to be suspected by the violent enemy. At that time, the violent enemy occupied Shanghai and spared no effort to numb the national consciousness of the people, using nets and restraints to suppress those with ideals. Even the wise could barely protect themselves. However, the initiators did not avoid the perilous environment and resolutely initiated Father's Day, ostensibly as a way to bless their fathers, but implicitly to commemorate the motherland. Even after the Eastern Territory had fallen, the people still longed for Shu. Even with the Southern Crown unchanged, the three households could still overthrow Qin. Their actions are commendable, and their deeds are praiseworthy. This national righteousness should be exemplified by the nation. Moreover, the red and white flowers used to commemorate Father's Day at that time represented the red and white plum blossoms of the motherland, both as a reminder of the concept of the motherland and to strengthen the spirit of perseverance in adversity. At that time, the initiators also donated over 20 million yuan to help with loan funds for primary and secondary schools. This was intended to revive education in the motherland and cultivate national seedlings. Based on these two facts, it is even more evident that the initiation of Father's Day was purely a genuine expression of national self-awareness during the war of resistance, which is perfectly compatible with the Mother's Day initiated by the United States after the First European War and shines with mutual brilliance. For the sake of commemorating the historical traces of the war of resistance and for the sake of promoting national morality, the central government should issue an explicit decree to designate it as a permanent festival. Therefore, we now jointly petition your bureau to review and promptly forward the request to the central government, granting approval to designate August 8th as Father's Day and issue a nationwide circular for its uniform implementation. This would be a truly virtuous deed. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Petitioners: Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, Song Hanzhang, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Jingheng, Li Denghui, Qian Yongming.</p>

<h3>Three Heads of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Answer Reporters' Questions; Current Economic Measures Aim to Resolve Difficulties for Factories in the Rear; Enemy-Puppet Factories Will be Transferred to Private Operation</h3>
<p>Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xiao, and Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs met with reporters yesterday to answer questions about current economic measures: (Question) Representatives of factories in the rear have petitioned in Beijing, proposing a "Plan for the Resumption of Work at Enemy-Puppet Factories," hoping to be treated favorably through joint ventures or delegated management. What is the Ministry's response? (Answer) The Ministry attaches great importance to factories in the rear that have made special contributions. As for what method will be adopted to solve the current difficulties of each factory, we are currently exchanging opinions with all parties. (Question) It is rumored that the government has decided to allocate thirteen of the enemy-puppet factories taken over in Shanghai to factories in the rear, giving them priority in purchasing them. Is this true? (Answer) This is being handled by the Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property. Detailed procedures have not yet been learned, but the number of factories that will be sold to private factories in the rear will be more than this number. (Question) It was originally stipulated that the textile industry would be transferred to private operation in two or three years. What method will be adopted in the future? Will the China Textile Company also be subject to this principle and be transferred to private operation on a fixed schedule? (Answer) The government's takeover of enemy-puppet factories for resumption of work through state-owned operation is temporary in nature. When production is back on track, they will be immediately transferred to private operation. The China Textile Construction Company is also included in this. When it is transferred to private operation in the future, it may adopt a company organizational method, selling stocks and allowing the people to invest and take over. (Question) More than one-third of the spindles in the country use American cotton as raw material. How will the sales of domestic cotton be remedied? (Answer) The Ministry attaches great importance to promoting domestic cotton. Where domestic cotton can be used, we will try to use it as much as possible. However, due to current transportation difficulties, factories have no choice but to replace it with American cotton. (Question) The factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have resumed work are currently headed by factory directors who are responsible for their management. Will this system be maintained for a long time? (Answer) The factory directors were temporarily dispatched to take charge of the factories for the needs of resumption of work. After the factories have been reorganized, separate handling methods will be formulated. (Question) The factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have resumed work are experiencing great difficulties in the turnover of funds. Are there any remedial measures? (Answer) The government has no budgetary funds to allocate to the factories that have resumed work. In principle, we hope that each factory can maintain production with its products. No other measures are currently being considered. (Question) The prices of domestic manufactured products are several times higher than those of similar products abroad. Has the government considered remedial measures? (Answer) This issue is very broad and cannot be answered in a few words. However, most of it is still affected by the exchange rate. (Question) What is the situation regarding the government's review of the takeover and handling of factories across the country? (Answer) Regarding the technical aspects of the takeover, because it involves various parties and is more complicated, it is not easy to make a judgment immediately. However, we are constantly investigating and improving it.</p>

Moreover, the authorities have no follow-up measures for the banned radio stations. For example, the radio station equipment is left unused, and it is susceptible to moisture, mold, and damage. For these reasons, it is planned to send representatives to Beijing to petition and request four points: (1) Request the Ministry of Communications to select competent personnel to come to Shanghai to conduct a general review. (2) Request the Ministry of Communications to increase the weekly rate or allow the same industry to operate jointly for relief.

(4) After the review, if it is determined that there is indeed non-compliance with the regulations, the government should fund the purchase or order the relocation to the mainland for establishment.</p>
<h3>Solving the City's Traffic Problems Requires Development in the Air and Underground</h3>

<h3>Introducing the New Qun Middle School in Hangzhou, Returning Victorious, Continuing the Songs, Studying Well in the Scenery</h3>
<p>"The plum rain season opens with rain in every household." In this first summer vacation after the victory, young students are all preparing to go home with a light heart to enjoy this long summer. However, graduating students may feel somewhat apprehensive about the issue of further education. Which school should they go to? Here, the author would like to give readers a brief report on the New Qun Senior Middle School, which will resume classes in Hangzhou this autumn.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the Founding</p>
<p>New Qun Senior High School was founded in 1940. At that time, the flames of war had severely impacted the original middle schools in western Zhejiang, making it difficult to fully restore them for a time. However, young people in the occupied areas, with enthusiastic hearts, came to the interior but had no place to study. Mr. Ruan Yicheng, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department, and others then initiated the establishment of New Qun Senior High School. After several plans, classes officially began in the autumn of that year in Shishi, Yongkang, the temporary provincial capital of Zhejiang at the time. After the opening of this middle school, it provided special relief to students from the occupied areas, and the teaching was also very conscientious, so it gained a good reputation in society. By the summer of 1942, there were six grades and more than 300 students. Unfortunately, the war situation changed rapidly that year, and many places in eastern Zhejiang were devastated. New Qun moved six hundred miles in one month, and the difficulties encountered along the way were beyond description. All equipment, except for books, was completely lost, so classes were temporarily suspended. The original students were introduced separately and transferred to provincial schools to continue their studies.</p>
<p>The Process of Resuming School</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, the New Qun School Board sent personnel to Hangzhou to prepare for the resumption of school, temporarily borrowing No. 7 Leifeng Pagoda as the school building. Leifeng Pagoda is one of the famous scenic spots in Hangzhou, facing the lake and backing the mountain, with beautiful scenery. It is only three li away from the lakeside, and both water and land transportation can reach it directly. Moreover, "the ruins of Leifeng are still visible, the sound of the Southern Bell is endless, and the flowers and trees are lush, and the garden is wide," making it a good place to study. The original houses, having been stationed by enemy and puppet troops, were mostly damaged. The School Board allocated huge sums of money to repair them, and they have generally been restored to their original appearance. The library currently has 15,000 volumes, and it is still being actively purchased from various sources. Physical, chemical, and biological instruments and specimens have been ordered from the United States according to the equipment standards of American secondary schools. It is estimated that more than 16 million yuan has been paid, and they can be shipped to Shanghai around the end of October this year.</p>
<p>Enrollment Steps</p>
<p>The school has now been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to resume classes starting this autumn. Mr. Zhu Yiqing has been appointed as principal. Mr. Zhu has served in the education sector for more than 20 years and was originally the principal of Wenzhou Middle School in Zhejiang Province. He was recently granted permission to resign in order to take over as the head of New Qun. Regarding the faculty, the appointed include Cui Dongbo, the former principal of Hangzhou High School in Zhejiang Province, and Pan Xijiu, the former principal of Shaoxing Middle School in Zhejiang Province, all of whom are well-known figures in the Zhejiang education sector. In the future, the academic standards and the style of learning will certainly be able to get a satisfactory answer, and answer the enthusiastic expectations of the social people. It is heard that the school will enroll four classes (200 students) of first-year high school students next semester, with entrance examinations to be held in Hangzhou around mid-August. Students from Shanghai or other places who come to Hangzhou to take the examination can ask the school to temporarily arrange accommodation. Detailed enrollment information is sent by Mr. Lin Renzhe of the school at No. 7 Leifeng Pagoda, Hangzhou, and anyone can request it by letter.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Personnel Who Participated in the War of Resistance and Were Dismissed Should Be Given Priority in Employment by Various Agencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a directive from the Executive Yuan approving a public letter from the Control Yuan, stating that, according to a report by Control Committee Member Li Xiaoting, the former Central Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for Refugees had registered dismissed civil servants returning to their hometowns. Recently, many of the personnel who have come from various directions are mostly scantily clad, suffering from exposure and wind, and wandering without recourse. The voices of complaint are loud, and many think of taking risks. At a time when the country urgently needs construction and people are urgently needed, it is regrettable to leave those who participated in the War of Resistance, faced difficulties, and were loyal to the country idle. Therefore, it is suggested to forward it to the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan, respectively ordering the recovered areas, provincial, municipal, and county governments, and security police bureaus to give priority to employing personnel who participated in the War of Resistance and were dismissed, allowing them to hold certificates or letters from superiors to apply for employment at the local agencies, which should immediately employ them according to their level, and not refuse or reject them, in order to encourage loyalty and quell disturbances. The letter requested verification and handling, which was approved. In addition to distribution, the order was issued to be followed and forwarded for compliance. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has issued an order to its subordinate agencies to comply.</p>
<h3>Academic Qualifications from Unregistered Schools</h3>
<p>Treated as Non-School Backgrounds</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior approved a letter from the Fujian Provincial Government, stating that civil servants applying to change their names or surnames, or to add a surname, should be handled in accordance with the regulations on the review of name changes and surname additions and additions of the Ministry of Interior, Article 12. However, how should it be handled if the person is not from a school, or the original school has been closed for a long time, and the local educational administrative agency has no record to verify and does not provide proof? It is approved to investigate that the academic qualifications referred to in Article 12 of the regulations on the review of name changes and surname additions and additions of the Ministry of Interior refer to schools that have been registered by the Ministry of Education or local educational administrative agencies. If the original school has been closed for a long time, and the local educational administrative agency has no record to verify and does not provide proof, it is naturally an unregistered school. This type of academic qualification is the same as a non-school background and should be handled according to the general procedures for people to apply, and is not restricted by the provisions of that article.</p>
<h3>Government Agencies at All Levels in Need of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate</h3>
<p>Should Participate in Bidding and Report to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government received an instruction from the Executive Yuan: Enemy and puppet houses and land should be sold by auction in accordance with regulations, and people and business groups should be given priority to purchase them in order to enrich the national treasury. Government agencies at all levels in need of houses and land should follow the general practice. Requests to allocate these houses and land are not in accordance with regulations. However, at a time when the housing shortage is serious, the lack of offices for government agencies will affect the implementation of public affairs. It should be handled flexibly. In the future, if government agencies urgently need to allocate enemy and puppet real estate, they should still participate in the bidding at the local enemy and puppet property disposal agency in accordance with regulations. The bidding agency should present the proportional bid price to the Executive Yuan for approval. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued an order to its subordinate agencies to comply.</p>
<h3>Elections in the Thirty-Second District</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Office Sends Personnel</p>
<p>The thirty-second district is actively preparing for the election of municipal councilors. The Municipal Government has sent Zhou Qizhong, an official from the Civil Affairs Office, to the district to supervise the matters to be handled for the election of municipal councilors, and Yang Wenduo, director of the district's cultural section, accompanied him to inspect the polling places.</p>
<p>In addition, Tong Zhengmin, the chief of the first bao in the district (Zhenru), has resigned due to other employment, which has been approved. The vacancy has been filled by Hu Bin, the chief of the eighth bao transferred from the district office. The vacancy left by the eighth bao chief is temporarily filled by Cheng Jianzhou. In addition, Xu Da, the chief of the second bao, was found to be ineffective and absent from his post without permission. He never attended the weekly bao chief meetings, which delayed important public matters. He was dismissed. The vacancy is temporarily filled by Song Shaochu, appointed by the district office on a trial basis, and a report has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Medical Care and Medicine in the Twenty-Third District</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the District People's Congress of the Twenty-Third District (Wusong) in this city, Yin Gongtian, and more than ten local gentry jointly organized the Wusong Summer Temporary Medical and Medicine Distribution Center with the medical community of the district. The medical community is responsible for free diagnosis and treatment, and the initiators are responsible for the Chinese capital. It began operations on the 26th of this month. Any poor people suffering from illness who seek medical treatment can bring their national identity card and register at the Wusong Fire Brigade for diagnosis and treatment from 9:00 to 11:00 AM every day. The District Office has ordered the bao to notify each household.</p>

<h3>Foreign Goods Pouring In, Fuel Shortage, Cement Industry in Jeopardy, Imported Cement Sold for Only 5,000 Yuan Per Bag, Coal Inventory Dwindling, Few Coal Allocations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Under the dumping of foreign cement, the domestic cement industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. According to reliable statistics from the customs, from January to June of this year, imports of foreign cement reached more than 500,000 bags. With a market price of 5,000 yuan per bag of 50 kilograms, the outflow of funds in half a year reached 250 billion yuan. Shanghai Cement Company, China Cement Company, Zhe新 Cement Company, and Taiwan Cement Company recently established by the Resources Committee have organized the China Cement Industry Federation to discuss solutions in order to save the current crisis. Yesterday, Mr. Xi Zhengxiu, secretary of the federation, told reporters that the first step is to request the government to increase the import tax on foreign cement. Currently, the production cost of domestic cement is more than 9,000 yuan per bag of more than 60 kilograms due to the high cost of wages, raw materials, fuel, and transportation. However, the market price of foreign goods is only 5,000 yuan per bag of 50 kilograms. In order to recover national interests, they have to sell it at a price of 6,000 yuan per bag, but how can they bear the loss in the long run? They will be forced to stop work one day. Now that the cost side cannot be reduced due to various factors, they can only hope that the government will increase import tariffs to seek remedy. Secondly, cement is a very necessary material for national defense and construction. Before the war, my country's cement industry had excellent achievements, such as the Elephant brand of Shanghai Yongni Company, the Taishan brand of China Cement Company, and the Horse brand of Qixin Company. Their quality even surpassed foreign goods, so all sectors of the country were very happy to use them. However, since the victory, the trend of blindly believing in foreign goods has become stronger, and even government agencies are doing so, which is extremely painful. Therefore, it is planned to request the government to find ways to encourage the people to use domestic goods. Furthermore, the source of fuel coal is extremely difficult. Taking Shanghai Cement Company as an example, it needs about 4,000 tons of coal per month, but the Fuel Allocation Committee can only supply about 100 tons. What it currently relies on to maintain is the coal left by the Japanese after the reception, but it is about to run out, so this point also needs to be urgently resolved.</p>
<h3>The Farmers Still Hold a Lot of Silk Cocoons; Failure to Purchase Them Soon Will Affect the Autumn Cocoons</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper visited a responsible person from the China Silk Company to inquire about the company's stance on China's silk industry. According to this person, the company hopes to provide a comprehensive solution for the Chinese silk industry. Regarding manufacturers, they hope to raise silk prices, maintain manufacturers' costs, and provide them with a small profit, so that the silk industry can be sustained. At the same time, the interests of silkworm farmers should be guaranteed. For example, there are still three to four thousand *dan* of silk cocoons held by various silkworm farmers. It is hoped that manufacturers will purchase them, so that the farmers will still have the interest to raise autumn silkworms. Regarding price, the production costs of silkworm farmers should be maintained and reasonable profits should be given. Ultimately, it is hoped that both government and the people can thoroughly improve China's silk industry, reduce production costs, increase production volume, and ensure a large quantity of uniform quality, so that the Chinese silk industry can be expected to recover. The responsible person concluded by saying: I deeply hope that after receiving government relief, manufacturers will not abandon the silk industry due to temporary low profits, but should maintain the spirit of persistent efforts, strive hard, and overcome this difficult stage, so that there is hope for a bright future.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Financial Institutions in Seven Major Cities Nationwide: Total of 912</h3>
<p>According to the latest statistics released by the Central Bank, there are a total of 912 financial institutions in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. Specifically, Shanghai has 359, Tianjin 105, Nanjing 52, Beiping 48, Guangzhou 13, Hankou 84, and Chongqing 251. These figures include all financial institutions in these areas, such as state-owned, provincial, municipal, and private banks, as well as silver shops, native banks, trust companies, insurance companies, and cooperative treasuries.</p>
<h3>Curbing Hoarding by Banks and Native Banks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Account Books. Due to the abundance of floating capital in this city, many banks and native banks are using this capital to buy up goods. Some are also using investment in factories as a pretext to hoard goods, which is greatly stimulating prices. To prevent this from happening, the financial authorities have not only issued strict orders to prohibit this, but have also dispatched personnel to investigate the transaction records of various banks and native banks. Anyone found to have committed the above-mentioned acts will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Imbalance in Silk Supply and Demand; Uniformly Weak Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Last week, rayon 120 from the Tianqiao brand was priced at 1.7 million yuan. Subsequently, due to the imbalance in supply and demand, the market price gradually declined. By the end of the week, the transaction price was 1.61 million yuan, a total decrease of 100,000 yuan. The 120 brand of bright yarn from miscellaneous factories was still selling well, so the price was more stable than Tianqiao. For example, Jin Sanma was priced at 1.63 million yuan on Monday and 1.57 million yuan at the end of the week, a decrease of 60,000 yuan. The 75 semi-matte yarn was selling very well in Hangzhou, with a shortage of 40,000 yuan last week. Factory-reeled silk was also weak. Grade 81 high uniformity was priced at 2.4 million yuan at the beginning of the week and 2.35 million yuan at the end of the week. Grade 78 was priced at 2.25 million yuan at the beginning of the week and 2.2 million yuan at the end of the week. The price of silk for ordinary users decreased by about 50,000 yuan during the week. Dried reeled silk received little attention, with a decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the beginning of last week. The price of Meiya silk damask for quilt covers was generally between 1.43 and 1.44 million yuan at the beginning of last week, but decreased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan each day from Thursday, for a total decrease of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Dacheng checkered crepe has been phased out and very little trading is taking place. The price decreased by more than 200 yuan starting from Thursday last week. However, Huajin crepe, purchased by customers, sold particularly well. The highest price on Wednesday was 2.15 million yuan, but due to the abundance of spot goods and uneven quality, the price returned to 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taiwan Shipping Costs Reduced to 48,000 Yuan per Ton</h3>
<p>Trade between Shanghai and Taiwan is gradually flourishing. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently adjusted the shipping costs for its vessels sailing between Shanghai and Keelung, Taiwan, and implemented a reduction starting yesterday. The original shipping cost was 72,000 yuan per ton, which has now been reduced to 48,000 yuan per ton. A general flat rate is charged for all kinds of goods, regardless of whether they are valuable items such as ginseng and woolen cloth, or ordinary items such as fertilizer and soybean cakes.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Ore Exports Begin; A Glimpse into Import-Export Merchants' Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Zhongkai wheel is scheduled to sail directly to Guangdong yesterday, fully loaded with cotton yarn, totaling more than 6,400 bales. Tungsten ore exports have begun. The Aeteward, managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., left Shanghai the day before yesterday and returned to Vancouver, carrying 100 tons of tungsten ore to Australia. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard &amp; Engineering Company's Hanyang wheel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, bringing more than 5,000 pieces of bananas and 7,000 pieces of general merchandise, as well as 1,500 tons of cotton, which is scheduled to be transported to Qingdao and Tianjin by the same vessel at noon today. It is reported that the cotton is relief goods. The Gordon, managed by the Runde President Lines, left Shanghai yesterday for Bombay, carrying more than 1,500 bales of factory-reeled silk from this city.</p>
<h3>Hardware Transactions Dull</h3>
<p>Transactions of steel plates were average last week. Pipes remained strong. Due to Nanjing merchants' procurement, man-made fiber and gauze prices were raised by 10-20%. As the season is about to end, many users are releasing green iron wire mesh, but buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a drop of 30,000-40,000 yuan. The second batch of files has been decided and will be transported soon, but only by five or six major companies, so prices are not expected to collapse. Due to competitive bidding, there is not much dog-brand door locks currently in stock.</p>
<h3>U.S. Lacks Cast Iron; Automobile Production Will Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The Civilian Production Administration announced today that automobile production may decline within the next three months due to a shortage of raw materials and parts. It is said that the main reason for the decline is a severe shortage of cast iron. In August and September, the Bureau will give priority to the allocation of cast iron to producers of agricultural machinery and housing materials, at which time the reduction in automobile production will be even more acute.</p>
<h3>Investigation of New Enterprises in Shanghai</h3>
<p>New China Scientific Instruments Manufacturing Factory, Co., Ltd., with a capital of 50 million yuan, has been approved for establishment by the Social Affairs Bureau and started operations at the beginning of this month. It specializes in the manufacture of scientific instruments, focusing on models of animals, plants and pathology, and also produces advertising tools, etc. The chairman is Chen Caifu, the general manager is Li Xianying, and the assistant managers are Zhou Huachen and Ding Peiqiang. The factory is located on North Shaanxi Road.</p>
<p>Da Shanghai Native Products Co., Ltd., located at 189 Dagu Road, with a capital of 13 million yuan, has been fully subscribed by the promoters Zhu Yuanxi and others.</p>
<p>Southeast Industries Co., Ltd., located at 8 Bulin Lane, Jinling Road, with a capital of 50 million yuan, has been fully subscribed by the promoters Wang Nanshan and others, and engages in the business of cloth, silk, cotton yarn, hardware, dyes, timber, industrial raw materials, medicines, and daily necessities.</p>
<p>Huaqiang Textile Factory, Co., Ltd., with a capital of 10 million yuan, has had half of its shares first subscribed by the promoters Xia Xingfang and others, with the remainder being raised, and engages in the weaving of Red Leaf brand towels and handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>Youai Underwear and Children's Wear Co., Ltd., with a capital of 12 million yuan, has had its shares fully subscribed and paid, and has elected Feng Mojun and others as directors. The location is at 18 Lane 6, Jiangsu Road.</p>

<h3>Grey Serge Revived</h3>
<p>White Serge Declines Alone</p>
<p>White serge has recently declined, and there are no accurate price quotes at tea parties. The supply and demand for raw serge is low, and because it is not a popular item, its price is often below that of other colors. Navy blue serge, regardless of thickness, sells well in all seasons. During the peak period of customer purchases, the market price rose sharply, and most are on par with grass green. Grass green serge is essential for military and government circles, and sales have been even smoother after the victory. Purchases from all over are extremely popular, and the production and inventory in Shanghai are scarce. The genuinely domestically produced Yinfeng and Zhanghua brands are particularly profitable. Recently, actual sales have gradually increased, and it is also the time when China Textile Corporation has no shipments, and the auction of enemy property inventories is about to end. The market sentiment for grass green and navy blue thick, all-wool serge is even stronger. Grey serge, which was popular more than ten years ago, has now been revived, and its price is higher than all other colors of serge, which also shows that things reach their extreme and then return, and that scarce goods are valuable.</p>
<h3>Company Managers Must Register Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>Failure to Comply Will Result in Legal Action</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of company managers, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to notify members of various trade associations through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to register in accordance with the law before the end of this year. Those who have previously appointed managers but have not yet registered must be ordered to apply for registration retroactively. Those who appoint managers in the future must report and register in a timely manner in accordance with the law. Failure to comply will be handled in accordance with Article 352, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law, and will still be ordered to register and report the handling situation for verification.</p>
<h3>"Underground Banks" in the Beijing-Shanghai Area Secretly Engage in Illegal Discounting</h3>
<p>A large number of banks and native banks that were active during the enemy and puppet period and have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance have emerged in the form of "underground banks" since they were ordered to suspend operations and liquidate. They secretly engage in illegal discounting, fueling usury, causing legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises to be unable to bear the pressure of high interest rates. The financial authorities have taken steps to crack down on them. According to reporters, these "underground banks" are scattered throughout the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line and in this city, and there are many of them. However, it is quite difficult to eliminate them thoroughly, because their discounting deducts interest first, leaving no traces on the bills. Moreover, they often have no public fixed offices, but conduct private transactions based solely on personal friendships. Furthermore, according to reliable information obtained by reporters, these "underground banks" suffered heavy losses in the recent collapse of the national public debt, estimating losses of at least 5 billion yuan or more. The disputes over returned checks have not yet been fully resolved.</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate Usury?</h3>
<p>— Shuang Hong</p>
<p>Indeed, usury, which promotes speculation and disrupts finance, has become the most widespread and uncontrollable serious problem today! The media has repeatedly published righteous and stern articles criticizing it, and the financial authorities have also paid close attention, investigating and banning so-called "underground banks" and "discounting companies." But usury has not been eliminated!</p>
<p>Is usury really impossible to eliminate? Not necessarily. But if we comprehensively review the actual economic conditions of industries and businesses in various regions and the local financial institutions, we can see that if we want to defeat usury, it will not be effective to use methods of investigation or banning. We need to study how to use other methods to make this usury disappear naturally.</p>
<p>Before discussing how to eliminate usury, we must first study how this usury has become so widespread as to create today's situation.</p>
<p>The so-called usury in the past was lending at exorbitant interest rates, and most of the people who borrowed this money were poor people who had nothing to pawn. Only then did they engage in this act of drinking poison to quench their thirst. Ordinary factories and shops had banks and native banks to deal with, and absolutely did not need to borrow money at exorbitant interest rates. Conversely, people who lent money at exorbitant interest rates certainly did not have such large assets to supply the widespread industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the so-called usury of the past—exorbitant interest rates—was only a small corner of the darkest bottom of society, and would certainly not affect or promote speculation and disrupt finance.</p>
<p>Since the fall of China to the enemy, due to the rampant issuance of counterfeit currency day by day, prices have been soaring madly day by day. The mentality of the general public is that hoarding goods is the only way to get rich, so they borrowed money at high interest rates to hoard goods at any cost. Naturally, supply meets demand. Banks and native banks claimed that funds were tight and raised interest rates day by day, resulting in usury even higher than exorbitant interest rates. But the result was really wronged. During the eight years of enemy occupation, compared to the people hoarding goods, it is said that the people lending money at high interest rates suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Since the victory, everyone thought that everything had changed, and that there would be no such strange phenomenon. Who knew that the first event in life was two hundred being treated as one, followed by the closure and liquidation of all banks and native banks in the recovered areas. They were neither allowed to resume operations nor allowed to establish new ones.</p>
<p>The result of two hundred being treated as one was a clearly visible, widespread stimulus to rising prices. Thus, the merchants and hoarders still could not forget hoarding goods, and they still borrowed money at high interest rates to hoard goods at any cost.</p>
<p>After all the banks and native banks in the recovered areas were closed, many practitioners had no way out, so they pooled a small amount of capital and lent money at high interest rates. This is also one of the reasons. But the biggest problem is that national banks cannot universally regulate industry and commerce. Small factories and shops feel that they have no access to temporary small loans for financial turnover. Besides temporarily borrowing from so-called discounting companies, they have no way to obtain loans!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the deposit interest rates of provincial, municipal, and county banks are too low. If someone believes in legal tender and regularly avoids speculation and hoarding goods, depositing cash in a bank to receive weekly interest rates of several fractions of a percent or one percent per week, they are certainly not such naive birds under the current standard of living. Because of this reason, whether it is public officials, shop clerks, or even women, they all know one way out: if they do not hoard goods, then all surplus funds can only be deposited in discounting companies to receive high interest rates. This has invisibly increased the strength of discounting companies.</p>
<p>The reason why usury has caused such a widespread situation today is nothing more than the above-mentioned reasons. Based on these reasons, we can easily obtain methods to eliminate usury.</p>
<p>(1) Strictly prevent bureaucratic capital from rushing into the ranks of unscrupulous merchants to speculate and manipulate. (2) Effectively suppress prices. (3) Increase bank deposit interest rates. (4) Quickly open up the establishment of new banks and native banks in various regions.</p>
<p>In short, usury is certainly not a one-sided affair. Lending begins with borrowing. If there is no need, then usury has no use. Points (1) and (2) are related. Without bureaucratic capital meddling in it, we believe that suppressing prices is easily effective. After prices stabilize, who would be willing to hoard goods, let alone borrow money at high interest rates to hoard goods? (3) Increasing bank deposit interest rates can bring floating capital into the right track and reduce speculation, and at least prevent ordinary clerks and women from blindly depositing into discounting companies. (4) If various regions open up the establishment of new banks and native banks, so that the general industrial and commercial sectors can universally obtain financial regulation, then who would be willing to borrow money at high interest rates from discounting companies?</p>
<p>The event of two hundred being treated as one has already passed. We hope that the financial authorities will quickly do things that can still be saved! Do not continue to keep the doors of new banks and native banks tightly closed, forcing industries and businesses to have no way to obtain loans and forcing them to borrow money at high interest rates from discounting companies. The current general situation can be said that the authority of financial activities in the provinces, cities, counties, and towns, except for Shanghai, is actually in the hands of discounting companies. This is not an exaggeration on my part. The general facts are like this. I hope that the financial authorities will no longer use official language and merely investigate or ban them, which can be said to be completely ineffective in reality. We urgently hope that the financial authorities will adopt our opinions, not to say things like "Why don't they eat meat porridge?" which are irrelevant and miss the point, but to come to the ground and observe the needs of the people's industry and commerce. Truly save the weak industries and businesses! This is the fundamental solution to eliminate usury.</p>
<h3>"White Elephant Country" A Scene of Storm: The Sudden Death of the King of Siam Before and After</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Bangkok, November 11th, from Jie Sun</p>
<p>Ever since Luang Phibunsongkhram (i.e., Nai Biri) resumed the position of Prime Minister of Siam, people have been apprehensive that the forces of dictatorial politics will be revived. In the general election of the National Assembly, the Democratic Party led by Seni Pramoj and Nai Khuang Apaiwongse declared defeat. Luang Phibunsongkhram's Constitutional Party was victorious, and almost all the figures from the Luang Phibunsongkhram era have returned to the political stage, making the dictatorial atmosphere even stronger. King Rama VIII, Mahidol Adulyadej (i.e., Ananda Mahidol), studied in Europe from a young age and was influenced by European and American thought. After returning to his country, he often interacted with Seni Pramoj and Nai Khuang, expressing goodwill towards China and the United States, which made him a target of the dictator's early suspicion. His sudden death this time has attracted worldwide attention, and the Siamese people, in particular, have many doubts. Members of the National Assembly have also repeatedly raised questions. A considerable number of people and members of the Assembly have been arrested as a result. Although the Luang Phibunsongkhram government has tried to cover up the truth in various ways and appointed Luang Arrun as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army for suppression.</p>
<p>According to general public discussion, almost all do not believe that the late King's death was accidental. The more outspoken Siamese newspapers, in addition to listing facts to refute the authorities' statement, also determined that the late King was indeed assassinated. Under the strong pressure of public opinion, Luang Phibunsongkhram had no choice but to comply with public sentiment and set up a special investigation committee to investigate this unprecedented case.</p>
<p>The Late King's Nanny Relates the Tragic Story</p>
<p>In addition to publicly summoning palace attendants who were close to the late King, a small committee was also established, inviting domestic, British, and American doctors to conduct an autopsy and experiment with shooting corpses in the head at Surithao Hospital in order to verify the gunshot wounds. According to the late King's nanny, Mae Nang, she is now sixty years old. She studied at the same school as the current Queen Mother in the past, and their relationship was harmonious when she served as a nurse. She often accompanied the King's father abroad. The late King was born in Germany and later moved to Paris when he was only three months old, and then moved to the United States again. The current King Bhumibol was born in the United States. The King's father was irritable and easily angered, and would occasionally try to harm himself over minor matters, such as jumping into rivers or off buildings. The late King's personality was exactly the opposite of his father: he was quiet and taciturn, and did not express his feelings, even if he was touched. Occasionally, he would become depressed and unhappy due to stimulation, but this was not common. According to daily habits, she would wait until the late King, the current King, and the Queen Mother had entered his bedroom before she went downstairs to rest in her bedroom. The night before the incident occurred, she did not notice any signs of difference, and the late King was no different from usual. At about 7:00 AM the next morning, she went upstairs as usual to serve the Queen Mother. After arriving upstairs, she saw that the Queen Mother and the current King were already up. Since there was nothing else to do, she went to visit the late King. At this time, she suddenly heard a gunshot. She was panicked and did not know what to do and heard a cry of "Ah, Mama..." When she entered the bedroom, the Queen Mother and the current King had already entered. The Queen Mother was embracing the late King in bed, and the current King was standing in front of the bed, embracing the Queen Mother. Both mother and son were crying, and the situation was very tragic. The late King was lying on his back, in a posture like someone sleeping soundly. Blood was flowing from his forehead, and a pistol was placed between the late King's left elbow. According to her, the late King's pulse was very weak, but his whole body was still warm. The late King often consulted her on matters after returning to the country, because he regarded her as his closest relative. On one occasion, he expressed to her how to enable the people to live in peace, which also shows the late King's concern for the suffering of the people. The late King was a wise ruler, who knew right from wrong, and was rich in moral concepts.</p>
<p>Twenty Famous Doctors Specializing in Autopsy Work</p>
<p>As for the autopsy of the late King's body, it was carried out by twenty famous doctors. The first step was to take an X-ray of the head, then open the skull, insert an iron bar from the wound on the forehead, pierce through the skull at the back of the head, making an oblique straight line, and then take an X-ray. Next, a square of skin was cut out from the wound on the forehead for examination. Another incision was made in the abdomen, and the stomach and large intestine were taken out and sent to the chemical laboratory for testing, and the results showed that there were no toxins present. A total of seven dead human heads were used for shooting experiments at Surithao Hospital. Six heads were shot in the forehead with pistols at varying distances, and only one was shot from the back of the head. All heads were X-rayed after being shot for record-keeping. After careful examination and experimentation, the participating doctors immediately convened a meeting to discuss their findings. The meeting stipulated that the three principles set by the police should be used as the criteria for discussion. The three principles are: (1) Accident, (2) Suicide, (3) Murder.</p>
<p>No Stimulation Before the Sudden Death</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the doctors specializing in psychology announced their opinions. According to them, after careful examination and experimentation, including an on-the-spot inspection of the late King's bedroom, there was absolutely no reason to believe that the late King had committed suicide. In addition, it was also investigated that the late King had not been subjected to any stimulation during his lifetime, especially on the night before the incident. There was no conflict of opinion with the Queen Mother and the King's brother. Even the closest nanny did not see any signs of unhappiness or displeasure on the late King's face. He only spoke of how to find a way to enable the people to live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Bone Expert Verifies Shooting Situation</p>
<p>According to the bone experts, the fracture and penetration of the skull was caused by a bullet shot at close range. The bullet passed through very quickly, and the explosive force of the bullet resulted in cracks in the skull. According to the reports of X-ray and microscopic experts, after careful examination of the square skin cut from the forehead, the wound was found to be concave and round, which was due to the pressure of the gun barrel. A 11 mm caliber pistol was then placed on the skin of the wound, which fit perfectly. Gunpowder was also found around the depression, which fully proved that the bullet entered from the forehead and exited from the lower end of the skull at the back of the head. It was observed that the shot was fired at the head of the bed, and the bullet penetrated the skull at the back of the head. When the head of the corpse was examined again, the path of the bullet shot in the forehead was straight, which means that the bullet entered from the forehead and exited from the upper end of the skull at the back of the head. As for the experiment of firing from the back of the head, the wound on the forehead where the bullet exited was larger than the entrance wound on the back of the head.</p>
<p>Who is the Murderer? Discussions are Very Diverse</p>
<p>At this point, the meeting unanimously agreed that the late King's death was indeed a murder. It was also unanimously believed that the late King was asleep in bed when he was murdered, and the murderer entered from the head of the bed, placed the gun barrel against the skin of the forehead, and then pulled the trigger. Thus, the death of Ananda Mahidol due to murder has become a definite conclusion, and who the murderer is and why he was murdered can be answered from two perspectives: Some say that it was the reactionary faction in Siam who committed the crime. Because although Ananda Mahidol was young, he was highly educated and had fresh ideas, and was very close to the new faction in the country. This time, he was preparing to go abroad, intending to visit the United States first, instead of going directly to Europe. When his itinerary was decided, Seni Pramoj volunteered to serve as the Siamese representative and go to the United States for assistance because French troops had invaded the border. This coincided with the Siamese King's visit to the United States, and the reactionary faction suspected that it contained political intentions. Another thing that aroused the hatred of the reactionary faction was that before going abroad, he inspected the Chinese business districts and various group organizations, accepted the warm welcome of the Chinese, had dinner with the representatives of the Chinese, and made pro-China remarks.</p>
<p>Complex Case, Said to Have International Background</p>
<p>Some say that the border disputes are serious, and the British troops stationed in Siam are also conducting exercises, simulating the occupation of important areas of Siam and its government agencies, echoing the French troops from afar. Then, a large number of British troops entered southern Siam from Malaya, claiming to suppress bandits. All these series of facts seem to indicate that an international storm is coming to the White Elephant Country on the Golden Peninsula! Under such dangerous circumstances, the sudden death of the king is considered to have an international background, attempting to create internal turmoil in Siam and reap the benefits. For more than a month, Siam has been turbulent. Luang Phibunsongkhram himself also made a statement a few days ago, saying that the previous disturbances were all bloodless, and that judging from the current situation, bloodshed is inevitable.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Wipe Tears and Hold Joint Public Memorial</p>
<p>In 1935, Siam underwent a revolution, and the political system changed from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. King Rama VII fled to England, abdicated, and let his nephew inherit the throne, that is, Ananda Mahidol. In 1938, Ananda Mahidol returned to Siam from Europe and ascended the throne at the age of about thirteen. Soon after, he went to Switzerland to study. During the reign of Luang Phibunsongkhram, the royal family was severely controlled, and its property was even declared confiscated. King Rama VII also died in a foreign land at that time. After the end of this war, Ananda Mahidol returned to his homeland on December 5 last year. He originally planned to stay for a while and then go to Europe, but because the new constitution had not been drafted in time, he delayed his trip until after the signing and promulgation of the constitution before deciding to accept President Truman's invitation to visit the United States. He was deeply dissatisfied with the actions of the Siamese rulers, but because the power was not yet in his hands, he was unable to do anything. When inspecting the Chinese business district, he replied at the welcoming meeting with the sentence "The two nations of China and Siam have had a deep relationship in history, and they must cooperate closely in the future," which gave a very good impression to our overseas Chinese. His tragic death is tantamount to China losing a good friend, and the overseas Chinese are deeply saddened. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Chaozhou, Hainan, Guangzhao, Hakka, Fujian, and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Associations jointly held a public memorial service. The Chaozhou Association's elegiac couplet reads:</p>
<p>"Ascending the throne for more than ten years, Qishan phoenixes sing, the people praise the holy king;</p>
<p>Returning for only half a year, Dinghu dragons leave, Chaozhou overseas Chinese wipe tears and mourn the wise king."</p>
<p>According to official reports, the new King of Siam and the police authorities have all proved that Mahidol's death was accidental, and a storm has come to an end.</p>

<h3>From the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to the Paris Peace Conference</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xue Yan, London Dispatch, November 11th</p>
<p>The ill-fated Paris Peace Conference can finally be convened. During the drafting of the treaty, although most of the difficulties were raised by the Soviet Union, the completion of the current draft treaty is also largely due to the Soviet Union's concessions.</p>
<p>When the four foreign ministers held their second meeting in Paris on June 15, the forms prepared by their representatives listed more than twenty points that the four foreign ministers had agreed to and disagreed with, which was a grand sight. However, the real disputes at the meeting were only three issues in the Italian treaty: (1) Reparations, (2) Italian colonies, and (3) Trieste. Among them, the amount and principles of reparations had already been decided by the four foreign ministers at the first meeting in April, and Italy should pay the Soviet Union 100 million US dollars. This time, the four foreign ministers argued about the source of reparations and the valuation of some of the assets used to offset the reparations. All Italian properties within the Soviet Union, the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, and the Soviet military zone in Germany were all valued and taken over by the Soviet Union to offset the reparations. However, the estimated total value of these properties differed between the American and Soviet experts, so there was some debate on the spot. However, this was ultimately an expert issue that could be studied objectively, and the results were still handed over to the experts for re-evaluation. In addition, some of Italy's military factories and several ships were also handed over to the Soviet Union as reparations. If the number is still less than 100 million US dollars, then the goods produced by Italy in the future will be transported to the Soviet Union and used as a substitute for the price. There was also a dispute over the types of products under the last item and the repayment period, but it was finally decided that payment should begin within three years after the treaty takes effect, and be paid off within six years from the date of first payment. As for the determination of the types, it will be agreed upon by the governments of the Soviet Union and Italy.</p>
<h3>The Depressing North</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Shaolin, Tianjin Dispatch, November 18th</p>
<p>The climate in the north is becoming increasingly hot. Although occasional showers bring some coolness, they are fleeting and cannot relieve the suffocating heat. The current situation is shrouded in haze, with gunfire erupting everywhere, further increasing people's depression. What people are reflecting on is no longer how to seek peace, but just dreaming of when peace can come. Everyone seems to have lost the courage to actively call for peace and has become passively and helplessly waiting.</p>
<p>The peace talks that went directly from Chongqing to Nanjing have evolved from infinite hope to a vague hope. So many people turned their attention to the local and regional negotiations, always hoping that the success of negotiations in one place would bring hope to another place. However, Chen Yi's refusal to go to Qingdao and Lin Biao's postponement of going to Changchun have made the people's hopes come to nothing, and expectations have turned into bubbles. What is left now, besides unparalleled depression, is only blind waiting. The weather is so hot that many people are expecting a downpour. The sky is indeed covered with thick clouds. Will this rain really fall?</p>
<p>The three-day war in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway in the early part of this month was an unprecedented large-scale conflict since the restoration. At that time, the common army's goals were two: one was Qingxian, and the other was Cangxian. In Qingxian, the common army used the 33rd Regiment, 35th Regiment, 63rd Regiment, Baoding Brigade, Xinle Brigade, Jinnan Detachment, field artillery company, and part of the militia. In Cangxian, there were the 24th Regiment, 78th Regiment, 17th Regiment, 18th Regiment, and Cangxian Brigade of the common army, etc., with a total force of about 20,000. At the beginning of the conflict, every important station on the railway line from Tianjin to Cang was attacked and destroyed by the common army. Then, the main force of the common army pointed to Qingxian. This battle lasted for three days and three nights. The common army was repulsed on the 8th, and Qingxian was relieved. As a result, more than 1,500 common army soldiers were annihilated, and the people along the line suffered the most. Who can say that the purpose of the common army was just this? In recent days, the Jinpu and Beijing-Nanjing lines have been generally calm, but listening to Mr. Zhou Enlai's remarks, it seems difficult to guarantee that it will remain so calm.</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Xiong Shihui, Zhang Jiaao, Lu Han, and others passed through Tianjin on the afternoon of the 17th and headed north. They stayed at the station for less than a quarter of an hour before hurrying to Ping. Xiong said that this trip did not have any mission, but many people meant that this was not an ordinary trip. If they wanted to prove that they were here for a summer vacation, then the Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, Du, had gone to Beidaihe from Tianjin the day before to prepare their residence for them. However, Gu and others did not stay in Beidaihe. Xiong answered reporters' questions separately in the car. The first question was of course the situation of the conflict in the Northeast. Xiong said that it had been relatively calm recently. When asked why the meeting with Du Lin had not been successful, he said that it was because Lin Biao did not go to Changchun. As for why Lin Biao did not go, he did not know. The reporter had a separate conversation with Zhang Jiaao for a few minutes. Regarding the takeover and reorganization of the Northeast industry and mines, Zhang said that he was gradually expanding and reorganizing. Zhang said that the main problem in the restoration of Northeast industry and mines was electricity. I asked: Do we have the strength to restore the required electricity? Zhang paused slightly and said, "It is always possible."</p>
<p>After the special train left Tianjin, the news reporters immediately received a notice: this news cannot be published, but the next day, all the newspapers in Pingjin published it. After the abolition of news censorship, the press has indeed gained freedom.</p>
<p>Today, observing the overall situation in the north, it is really impossible to see the reason. Because the whole situation is still in chaos. The Tianjin military vehicle authorities have repeatedly and firmly stated that the security of Tianjin is extremely solid. This point has indeed gained the trust of the people. Although the common army's area is only a few dozen miles away, the people's hearts are unusually stable. Starting from the 16th of this month, the Tianjin authorities began to train citizens. At first, it caused some doubts among the citizens. After the authorities positively stated that it was to supplement the shortage of police and engage in local security, people's psychology gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>In a few days, it will be the time when the green gauze tent rises. Whether it can be passed peacefully will be answered by the facts. If the peasants' blood and sweat are cherished, then those crops should no longer be harmed. If our material resources are considered extremely scarce, then it can also be clearly understood that the war of attacking in and retreating is useless. Look at a recent example: in the Qingxian battle, the dozens of common army soldiers captured were about to be incorporated into the local teams. Are these people considered liberators, or are they being liberated? Basically, they don't know what's going on.</p>
<h3>Trieste Issue Establishes Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>Trieste has always been one of the international disputes because of the complexity of the ethnic groups of the inhabitants and as a commercial import and export point for the Balkan Peninsula. When the four foreign ministers met for the first time in Paris, every time they talked about Italy's territory in Africa, they always said: "Considering that Italy may lose territory in other areas," they hinted at the Soviet Union's intention to completely separate Trieste from Italy and merge it into Yugoslavia. In fact, the most heatedly debated issue at the second four foreign ministers' conference was the Trieste issue. In the end, it was a great achievement to adopt the compromise plan proposed by France, which can be said to be the greatest achievement of the second four foreign ministers' conference. Now, the agreed draft is translated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The four foreign ministers agreed to establish the Free Territory of Trieste, the area of which includes the entire territory west of the Duino line and south of Cittanuova, as suggested by France.</p>
<p>(2) The integrity and independence of this free territory shall be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>(3) A special committee shall be organized by representatives appointed by the Security Council (including representatives of the four powers), after consulting the governments of Yugoslavia and Italy, to submit recommendations on the administrative organization of the territory to the twenty-one-nation peace conference.</p>
<p>(4) The regulations of this free territory, after being approved by the Security Council, shall be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15 of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>(5) Recommendations on the establishment of the interim government and permanent regulations of this territory shall be submitted by the twenty-one-nation peace conference.</p>
<p>(6) The establishment of its interim government and permanent regulations shall be in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p>A. The chief executive of this territory shall be appointed by the Security Council after consulting the representatives of South Italy. B. The legislative and judicial institutions of the interim government shall be established in a democratic manner.</p>
<p>C. The rights enjoyed by its citizens regarding language, religion, newspapers, education, and public service shall be respected.</p>
<p>D. Its chief executive shall submit a report to the Security Council annually.</p>
<h3>Italian Colonies Reach New Agreement</h3>
<p>There were also several unexpected developments in dealing with the issue of Italian colonies. The Dodecanese Islands were merged into Greece, and the status of its territory in Africa will remain as it is for the time being, and a final decision will be made in a year. The full text of the agreement is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Italy renounces all ownership and title to its territory in Africa.</p>
<p>(2) Before a final decision is obtained, the above-mentioned territory shall continue to be governed by the current administrative agencies.</p>
<p>(3) The final disposal of the above-mentioned territory shall be determined by the four powers within one year after the treaty takes effect, in accordance with the principles of the joint declaration issued by the four powers.</p>
<p>The draft of the joint declaration has the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The four powers agree to jointly determine the final disposal of Italian African territory within one year after the Italian treaty takes effect.</p>
<p>(2) When the four powers finally dispose of the above-mentioned territory, they shall make decisions in accordance with one or more of the following resolutions. As for whether it applies to the entire territory or ten parts of it, it shall be decided based on the wishes of the local residents and the opinions of the governments concerned.</p>
<p>A. Independence.</p>
<p>B. Merge into neighboring territory.</p>
<p>C. Trusteeship by the United Nations collectively or by one of the countries.</p>
<p>(3) If the four powers cannot reach an agreement in accordance with the above resolution, they shall submit it to the United Nations General Assembly and request recommendations, which the four powers agree to accept and take appropriate steps to implement. However, the promise given by the British government to Senussi during the war must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>(4) The foreign ministers' representatives shall continue to discuss the issue of the disposal of Italian African colonies, and may send investigation teams to the above-mentioned places or any one place to search for materials related to the foreign ministers' meeting finally resolving the above issue.</p>
<h3>US-UK Cooperation Isolates the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Although the Italian colonial issue has not been completely resolved, only postponed for a year, the progress has been considerable, considering the initial differences among all parties and their development. We know that the Soviet Union originally intended to occupy the Dodecanese or to administer Tripolitania (Tripoliatnia) alone. However, in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the Soviet Union realized that its proposal would not pass and instead supported the United Nations' trusteeship or Italy's continued trusteeship of a portion of the territory, which was almost in line with the US opinion. Britain, with its strong interest in expanding its imperial power, especially considering that the Italian territories in Africa were already under its occupation, naturally wanted to take them for itself. Initially, it wanted to separate the handling of the colonial issue from the peace treaty itself, which was almost impossible in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers. Therefore, it proposed to have Cyrenaica under British trusteeship and Libya granted independence, citing the British government's wartime promise to the Senussi. The British idea of independence was naturally modeled after countries like Egypt and Transjordan, making it another link in the sphere of influence of the British Empire. The Soviet Union attacked this most vehemently. Therefore, in the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the British opinion on the colonial issue was very isolated, while being close to the French. However, in this (second) meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the United States no longer opposed Britain, so the handling of the colonial issue actually passed completely according to Bevin's suggestion. Britain ultimately did not completely achieve its goals, but it was at least very close to its original plan. This shift seemed to have occurred after the first meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers and before the second meeting. Whether there was an understanding between Britain and the United States is unknown, but British diplomacy has always been known for its cleverness, exploiting the contradictions of other countries to seek its own interests, which is a consistent policy of British diplomacy. Also, in the second meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers, the cooperation between Britain and the United States was seamless, far better than in the first meeting. Close cooperation between Britain and the United States and the complete isolation of the Soviet Union was one of the main reasons for the success of this meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers.</p>
<h3>US Withdrawals Lead to Soviet Concessions</h3>
<p>In the Four Foreign Ministers meeting, in addition to the disputes regarding the peace treaty itself, there were also issues regarding the conference itself, such as the determination of the date, the inclusion of rules of procedure on the invitation, and the issue of inviting countries. Among these, the last one, related to China, involved the Soviet Union opposing China's inclusion as one of the invited countries. The US representative said that this action was tantamount to insulting China. The British representative said that he had no preconceptions about whether China should be included as one of the invited countries, as long as the Soviet Union did not intend to insult China. Molotov did not explicitly state that he did not intend to insult China, but also did not state that he did, so no one insisted on the matter.</p>
<p>In this meeting, secret negotiations were used extensively, thus avoiding many deadlocks caused by face-saving issues. Many small problems were compromised in advance, and passed smoothly in the meeting. The most effective way to prompt Soviet concessions was naturally the threat from Britain and the United States to directly submit the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and to separately negotiate a peace treaty. In large international conferences, the Soviet Union is often in the minority, which it has repeatedly experienced. And Italy is now under the influence of Britain and the United States. If the Soviet Union were to break with Britain and the United States and negotiate a peace treaty with Italy alone, it would probably gain even less, so it naturally preferred to make concessions. Therefore, every time the United States indicated that it was willing to withdraw, the Soviet Union was willing to make concessions, which was one of the main reasons for the success of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Answering Reporters: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) Question from Wang: My sister is 38 years old. She has been married for 20 years. The relationship between her and her husband was initially harmonious. Now, they have children. Although their family life is not wealthy, they have enough to eat and wear. However, good times don't last. My sister's husband has been seeking new romance since two years ago. He resents the family and often quarrels with them. Initially, my sister was unaware of this. After his behavior changed, she investigated and found out the truth, but her repeated劝劝劝 were ineffective. Now, my sister is suffering from mental breakdown and sometimes goes mad. If we take legal action, and the other party knowingly marries a married man, is there a crime of disrupting the family? Can the court rule for divorce? Otherwise, can the legal wife request a one-time payment of alimony and live separately?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanlin:] According to the criminal law, a woman who has an affair with a married man commits the crime of disrupting the family. She can sue the other party in court and have them punished according to the relevant laws. If the legal wife does not pursue prosecution and wishes to live separately, she can request a one-time payment or monthly payment of lifelong alimony from her husband.</p>
<p>(2) Question from Luo Jiamo: My best friend, Mr. Mao, at the age of 17, through a matchmaker and his parents' decision, entered into a marriage contract with a woman who graduated from elementary school. Because of circumstances, I did not participate in the decision. Three years have passed since. My friend has the desire to terminate the contract and is often unhappy because of this. Now he is of legal age and should have the right to make his own decisions about marriage. However, it is impossible to directly negotiate a termination. My friend is afraid of delaying the woman's youth and wants to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the marriage contract invalid. However, he does not know if there are any legal conflicts. Please have your legal expert advise.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Chuan Kuanlin:] According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, a marriage contract should be entered into by the man and woman themselves. Since Mr. Mao does not agree to the non-autonomous marriage contract, he can notify the woman in writing, stating that the marriage contract is invalid. If the woman does not agree, he can file a lawsuit in court to terminate the marriage contract.</p>
<p>(3) Question from Chang Dongliang: Your column has long been reputable. I have a question, please provide an answer. I am 23 years old this year. Three years ago, through a matchmaker's introduction, I became engaged to a 19-year-old woman and obtained the consent of both sets of parents. It was stated that the marriage contract would be fulfilled in three years. Now, I have suddenly received a letter of termination of the marriage contract. How should I respond? (1) Is this letter of termination of the marriage contract valid? (2) How should I proceed with the protest procedures? (3) How can I recover all the expenses and gifts from the engagement?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuanlin:] According to Article 975 of the Civil Code, the performance of a marriage contract cannot be enforced. Since the woman has decided to request the termination of the marriage contract, you can request compensation from her for all losses incurred during the engagement. If the woman refuses, you can file a lawsuit in court to claim damages.</p>

<h3>Pharmaceutical Factories Note the Expiration Dates on Injections</h3>
<p>To Avoid Patient Suffering from Reactions</p>
<p>Recently, many "glucose injections" sold on the market are of poor quality due to prolonged storage. Patients are unaware of this. Within half an hour after injection, they experience chills, like a malaria attack, and gradually recover after 45 minutes, followed by fever. Doctors say this is a reaction caused by deterioration, which affects the patient's health. Therefore, I urge all pharmaceutical factories to affix "expiration dates" to each box so that buyers can know it at a glance. If pharmacies know that the goods have been stored for too long, please do not sell them. It is also an act of accumulating virtue. From Huang Aolin, who has been affected</p>

<h3>The Significance of Manual Arts</h3>
<p>— Jiang Danshu</p>
<p>"Manual Arts" is a type of art. In the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic of China (1932-1933), the Ministry of Education revised the curriculum standards and designated it as a course term. Since then, it has been highly valued by educators. Even the Ministry regulations stipulate that students who fail in manual arts must repeat a grade because manual arts is an artistic instinct inherent in human beings.</p>
<p>Some people think that manual arts is about teaching skills, but this is not entirely accurate. It should be known that its educational significance outweighs its technical significance. Taking primary school as an example, children's nature is that none of them do not like to labor, do not like to make, in other words, everyone likes to move, likes to tinker, (pronounced gǎo, in Hangzhou dialect). As long as there is something to tinker with, anything is fine.</p>
<p>People Have an Innate Laboring Nature Regardless of whether they are the sons of officials or commoners, city dwellers or rural people, they are all the same. This is the "innate laboring nature" common to all human beings. This nature is the "source of life and the instinct of art." People cannot live without labor, nor should they live without it. Therefore, this nature is very precious and should be cultivated and developed in educational methods and opportunities, and should not be obliterated or diminished. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What Heaven imparts to man is called his nature; an accordance with this nature is called the Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction." Since we have this good nature, we should naturally follow this natural principle and train him according to the situation. The so-called method of guiding the situation is the manual arts class. This is the important principle for "manual arts" to become a type of "education."</p>
<p>The manual arts class in primary schools is to cultivate laboring habits, not to impart various skills. The manual arts class in middle schools certainly needs to attach importance to some skills, but it is not to impart specialized</p>
<p>Manual Arts Can Cure Fashionable Diseases skills, but still focus on cultivating laboring habits and working interests. To put it more clearly, focus on "curing diseases," "curing diseases." If these diseases can be fundamentally cured, then you can step into the "reality," "diligence," "frugality," "integrity," and "chastity" moral circles. At this time when human desires are rampant and extravagance has become a custom, the old dandies have transformed into new slickers, with hair greased, bodies upright, clothes scented, and feet shining. These people are everywhere. Especially some modern wives, besides cosmetics, use blood-red nail polish, besides bracelets, wear anklets like shackles. They certainly have not labored, are unwilling to labor, and even want to look down on the other party's laborers, laugh at them for wearing queues, and despise the virtue of others' diligence, while boasting about their beauty and dressing up their precious little citizens like foreign dolls, indulging them like Jia Baoyu, hiring cars to pick them up from school and cars to pick them up from the park. Sometimes they even take them to red-light green-screen places to eat delicacies and watch dances, cultivating a habit of daintiness, laziness, extravagance, and superficiality from a young age, making it an incurable second nature! The art of manual labor is a painful针砭 for this root of the disease. You must have your foreign doll sweep the floor, wipe the table, pour out the chamber pot, mix mud, learn to be a little carpenter, a little tailor, and also go to the garden to learn how to grow vegetables, flowers, and trees, water, and fertilize, making your foreign doll like a little apprentice and a little shepherd boy. It is precisely because of this that families who do not understand art education object. The child comes back, and his clothes are dirty. The mother asks what he is doing. The child says he is doing manual arts. So the ears of the manual arts teacher must be burning hot from afar, right? In fact, the children themselves are not afraid of labor, not afraid of work, not afraid of getting dirty, and do not think of themselves as young masters and young ladies. They like to do manual arts very much, which shows that the nature of labor is indeed innate. Education should follow nature and not go against it. On this point, it is hoped that the family's views will be consistent with the school so that the second generation of citizens who are democratic and equal can be cultivated.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that a person who has received consistent, systematic, and good manual arts education from family and school from childhood to adulthood can cultivate such a "character model." - If there is no ready-made food to eat, they can cook for themselves; if clothes are torn, they can mend them; if they are dirty, they can wash themselves, and if they are seen doing these things by friends, they do not feel embarrassed;</p>
<p>Manual Arts Can Cultivate Good Character Types if the legs of a stool are broken, they can fix them; if a light bulb is broken, they can repair it; when going out to prevent rain, they can take a paper umbrella or a broken foreign umbrella; if they encounter rain halfway, they can walk barefoot; they can usually grow vegetables and raise chickens, and they can chop firewood and catch fish temporarily; if the old master goes on strike, they can倒目倒 the toilet; if the rickshaw puller knocks on the bamboo clapper, they can lift their feet and walk by themselves; if the cost of living is too high and the income is too low, and it is not enough to maintain integrity, they can also make small crafts to sell for money or use themselves;... But if they can suddenly rise to prominence, they can also be good officials; because they have such abilities, they are naturally honest in ordinary times and will not lose their integrity in times of change, can be content in poverty, and will not be arrogant and lustful in wealth. If you don't believe it, please open history and look: the great statesman Shun was born as a farmer, fisherman, and kiln worker; Yi Yin was born as a farmer; our Jiang Taigong was also born as a fisherman; the young Zhu Maichen was born as a woodcutter; Tao Yuanming and Zhuge Liang also practiced farming; and many great masters were able to live by themselves and provide for themselves; they all have complex minds, simple lives, goods in their stomachs, and no airs on their faces. In other words, they are typical figures who are both civil and military, both rough and fine. When they were not officials or not rich, they did not think about being officials every day or think about getting rich every night. After they became officials, they could naturally take out the spirit of hard work to do things for the public, unlike later generations, especially modern people, who put on airs everywhere and always want to make money; it can be seen that labor and knowledge are not only not contrary to each other, but also complement each other, so I hope that wise families and the general public will not say that labor is worthless and oppose it.</p>
<h3>The Founding Writers of Literati Painting: Zong Bing and Wang Wei</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Most people believe that Chinese literati painting was founded by Wang Wei and Wang Qia in the Tang Dynasty. Dong Qichang in the Ming Dynasty even divided the painters of past dynasties into two major schools, the Southern School and the Northern School, and used the method of "yellow robe adding body" to honor Wang Wei as the founder of the Southern School. This is really a bit of "forgetting one's ancestors" because the real founders of literati painting were Zong Bing and Wang Wei, who were more than three hundred years earlier than Wang Wei.</p>
<p>Zong Bing, courtesy name Shaowen, was a native of Nieyang, Nanyang. He was born in the second year of Emperor Xiaowu's Ningkang of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (374 AD) and died in the twentieth year of Emperor Wen's Yuanjia of the Song Dynasty (443 AD) at the age of sixty-nine. He was contemporary with Gu Kaizhi, and his death was about thirty years after Gu's. Wang Wei, courtesy name Jingxuan, was a native of Linyi. He was born in the eleventh year of Emperor An's Yixi of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (415 AD) and died in the twentieth year of Emperor Wen's Yuanjia of the Song Dynasty at the age of only twenty-nine. He was born in the year of Gu Kaizhi's death, and died in the same year as Zong Bing, which can be said to be extremely coincidental, but their lifespans were different.</p>
<p>Zong Bing and Wang Wei not only lived in the same era, but their personalities, learning, art, and writings had many similarities. Bing "lived in mourning excessively, and was praised by the villages," "his wife, Luo, also had high sentiments and shared interests with Shaowen. After Luo died, Shaowen was excessively grieved." He did his best to support the orphans of his two elder brothers, which shows that he was a virtuous gentleman. Wang Wei was also a person who was devoted to his siblings. His younger brother, Sengqian, had talent and learning. When he fell ill, Wei treated him himself. Sengqian died because he took medicine improperly. Wei deeply blamed himself and fell ill. Forty days after Sengqian's death, he died at the young age of twenty-nine.</p>
<p>Zong Bing was "skilled in Qin books and refined in reasoning," while Wang Wei was "fond of learning since childhood and had read everything, was good at writing, calligraphy, and painting, and also understood music, medicine, Yin-Yang techniques, and divination." It can be said that both were versatile artists.</p>
<p>Although Zong Bing's family was very poor, he was not seduced by profits. Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty wanted to recruit him as a secretary, but he declined. When asked why, he said, "Bing has lived in the hills and valleys for thirty years." Emperor Wu appreciated his answer and stopped. He asked to be a hermit who could roam the mountains and forests and live in the hills and valleys, but he was unwilling to be a secretary who would follow the trend and fawn on others. His high character can also be imagined. He also liked to "live in leisure and tranquility" to cultivate his moral character. As for Wang Wei, he also "often lived in a room, reading books and playing with antiques, without going out for more than ten years." Emperor Shizu gave him the title of Secretary because he was chaste and reclusive, and he was also a noble who did not like to be an official. These two people's attitude seems too passive and too grey in modern times, without the active spirit of saving the world and helping the people. However, an artist needs a chaste and reclusive personality in order to not be lured by profits, not be subdued by power, and be able to roam freely in the spiritual realm of heaven and earth without being touched by external things. This spirit of despising corruption and standing upright, not taking anything, has been passed down from Chao Fu, Xu You, Boyi, Shuqi, Lao Tzu, and Zhuang Zhou to Zong Bing and Wang Wei. It is a kind of transcendent attitude in Chinese philosophy, ethics, and art, and it has formed the original life of Chinese art. "If a person's character is not high, the ink cannot be used properly." If an artist does not have a noble character, his works will not have eternal value. It is a pity that many people who call themselves artists now forget (or simply do not know) the fundamental starting point of Chinese artists. They follow the trend in their daily production, catering to what wealthy merchants like. In the era of precarious national fortune, they do not hesitate to fawn on the enemy and serve the enemy. Such people have no backbone, no character. Even if their skills are very pure and the colors are very gorgeous, and all their works are bought by people who see with their ears instead of their eyes, they are actually worthless. They are false works with only shells and lacking souls, and are not enough to pass on to future generations.</p>
<p>Zong Bing had "Preface to Painting Landscape" and Wang Wei had "Preface to Painting" and other writings. They are the earliest and most wonderful treasures in Chinese painting theory. Not only are the words high and wonderful, but their elaboration of the principles of painting has unique insights. The main point is to liberate painting from the practical aspects and give it a free, lively, ethereal, and ideal realm. From then on, it became the source of literati painting, and made Chinese art. Possess a "distinctly different" style.</p>
<h3>About the Art Center Station</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The Art Center Station – this name seems quite unfamiliar. To put it grandly, it's an unprecedented initiative in the history of Chinese education; to put it simply, it's the establishment of this simple art education institution due to the current financial constraints in education and culture.</p>
<p>It has been nearly forty years since China began implementing new education, but art education has yet to be popularized. Any beautiful works of art are not appreciated by the general public, and any valuable art exhibitions do not receive the attention of the general public, as if art has no relation to society. In the past, educational authorities did not pay attention to this issue, and schools did not value this issue. Therefore, there are no art institutions such as art galleries or painting galleries established in society, and the general public cannot obtain tools for lofty spiritual adjustment. Art classes in schools have become nominal subjects that are neither alive nor dead, and all equipment and teachers are empty and extremely incomplete. Students' parents look down on art, believing it to be of no practical use, and students do not take art education seriously.</p>
<p>After the restoration of this city, the educational authorities first noticed the issue of art education. Thus, the Art Center Station was born. Its purpose, to put it succinctly, is to promote public art education and to solve the difficulties of art education facilities and teachers in various schools in this city. It is hoped that the general public will understand the relationship between art and life, and then pursue a rational spiritual life in the direction of art; at the same time, to enable the serious implementation of art education in this city. The work goals of the Art Center Station are briefly introduced below: The work goals of the Art Center Station are two:</p>
<p>(1) To promote the appreciation and research of art among the general public;</p>
<p>(2) To assist in the implementation of art education in schools.</p>
<p>The first item can be implemented through five methods:</p>
<p>(1) Hold various art exhibitions; (2) Organize art lectures; (3) Set up mobile painting galleries; (4) Convene symposiums for the art community; (5) Organize amateur art research classes.</p>
<p>The second item can be implemented through four methods: (1) Research art teaching materials and teaching methods; (2) Supply art teaching tools and equipment; (Schools near the Art Center Station can schedule dates to come to the station for practice). (3) Guide art teachers in further study; (Hold art education demonstrations). (4) Enhance the effectiveness of art education. (Special training will be given to children with artistic talent.)</p>
<p>Proceeding according to these two major goals, the work is very difficult. It is hoped that domestic art educators and artists will provide assistance in various ways so that art education in this city can achieve considerable success.</p>
<h3>Methods of Arranging Landscape Paintings (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Mingshi</p>
<p>For those who study landscape painting, as long as their talent is not particularly low, understanding the methods of using the brush and ink is relatively easy. As for the actual techniques of painting trees and rocks, they are even easier to learn. However, for composition—that is, the method of arrangement—beginners not only find it difficult to apply, but also find it not very easy to understand the principles. Now we will focus on explaining this point in more detail, so that we can break the bad habit of only being able to copy but not create drafts.</p>
<p>To explain the arrangement of landscape paintings, we must first explain the principles of composition in landscape paintings. Originally, the composition of landscape paintings is not a realistic depiction of the scenery, but a reduction of the real scenery using a bird's-eye view, and then a depiction of it. For example, when we go to the countryside to see real landscapes, what we can see with our eyes is only a layer of mountains or a stretch of water. Such simple scenery is not easy to constitute a landscape painting. We have to go deep into the landscape, view all the scenery, and then return home and reduce what we have experienced like drawing a map. The painter makes himself very large and the scenery very small, as if he is looking down on the mountains, so that he can form a "thousand miles within a foot" picture. Once we understand this point, we can know the principle of "perspective," so we cannot fully apply it to Chinese landscape painting.</p>
<p>However, having said that, some Chinese landscape paintings are very similar to real scenes, such as those by Mi Fu, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui in the Song Dynasty; and Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Bada Shanren, and Mei Qing in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. However, these are just variations in Chinese landscape painting and cannot represent the orthodox painting method of Chinese landscape painting. The landscape paintings we usually see are always characterized by layers of mountains and distant landscapes, which can only be imagined in the mind or seen in paintings. We cannot see them all in the real natural world.</p>
<p>Some people say that Chinese landscape paintings represent the scenery seen from above. This statement does have considerable reason, because the higher a person stands, the wider the view, and the smaller the things seen. As the saying goes, "Confucius climbed Mount Dongshan and found Lu small, climbed Mount Tai and found the world small," which is the same principle. However, if Chinese landscape paintings were really writing the scenery seen from above, then the things at the foot of the mountain could not be seen very large and clear. Now, ordinary mountains and paintings always focus on the scenery at the foot of the mountain. The so-called main trees, main rocks, and water are often described in great detail, while the mountain peaks above are mostly described in general terms. This is still not in line with the principle of perspective, so the reason that Chinese landscape paintings depict the scenery seen from above is still not very satisfactory, but it seems to have this trend.</p>
<p>In short, Chinese landscape painting paints poetry, paints materials that have been cut by poets, not the original dull mountains and clumsy water. Therefore, the complex scenery, thousands of mountains and valleys, is extremely majestic; the simple scenery, one tree and one rock, is extremely open and spacious. It is abstract, literary, and even philosophical, and cannot be explained by scientific theories. This is its shortcoming, and it is also its strength.</p>
<p>There are usually three rules for the scenery in Chinese landscape paintings: The first is Pingyuan (level distance)—the scenery seen from near to far, the arrangement should be flat and open, not high and steep. The second is Gaoyuan (high distance)—the scenery seen from below to above, the arrangement should be high, dangerous, and steep, not flat and deep. The third is Shenyuan (deep distance)—the scenery seen from the outside to the inside, the arrangement should be deep and distant, not shallow and solid. There are also Pingyuan that combines Gaoyuan or Shenyuan, Gaoyuan that combines Shenyuan or Pingyuan, and Shenyuan that combines Pingyuan or Gaoyuan. However, the various layout methods are ever-changing, but their principles are ultimately nothing more than the principle of "three distances." (Small and horizontal paintings are suitable for Pingyuan, horizontal paintings are also suitable for Shenyuan, large and vertical paintings are suitable for Gaoyuan and Shenyuan, and vertical paintings are especially suitable for Gaoyuan).</p>
<p>The Pingyuan scenery often uses slopes and sand and water to express; the Gaoyuan scenery often uses paths and waterfalls to express; the Shenyuan scenery often uses layers and clouds and smoke to express. This is also something that those who study landscape painting should know.</p>
<p>Regardless of Pingyuan, Gaoyuan, and Shenyuan, there is only one secret to arranging the layers of trees, rocks, and mountains: the "inverted V arrangement method." The so-called "inverted V" is an inverted V. For example, if you draw a clump of trees and rocks on the left, count it as one layer, and then draw a clump of trees and rocks on the right, it is another layer. The left side of the left is high and slopes downward to the right, and the right side of the right is high and slopes downward to the left. The structure of these two layers becomes an inverted V. Then draw a mountain peak on the left and a mountain peak on the right, and it becomes an inverted V again. Repeatedly superimposed in this way, it becomes countless inverted V's (Pingyuan has fewer layers. Gaoyuan and Shenyuan have more layers, especially Shenyuan, if there are not many layers, it lacks the fun of secludedness). However, the size of the area occupied by each layer should not be uniform. The first layer has a large area, the second layer should be smaller, the third layer has a small area, and the fourth layer should be larger. By changing in this way, the layout will not be rigid. Also, in the middle of the three large "V"s, there are often many small "V"s; in short, there is no place that is not different, no place that does not change, so that all abilities can be exhausted.</p>

<h3>Artistic Musings</h3>
<p>— Translated by Huang Hanqiu, written by Takarmura</p>
<p>The meaning of art should not be regarded as the "freehand" expression that the world usually talks about. It would be a mistake to compare the feeling of tired people in the actual social life who, when waiting quietly for dinner in the evening, are presented with a glass of wine hidden from the Napoleonic era to art. However, it has become a common thing in the world to compare it to art, and it can enable people in the world to obtain such things, which is considered the ability of an artist. Of course, there are not a few people who do not think this way, but in fact, there are many who think this way. Art brings comfort to people, increases interest, and as a result, people who have tasted the bitterness of actual society seem to have obtained a valuable flavor enhancer. It is now common sense in the world to think in this way.</p>
<p>According to such a reality, the original tone of the world is lowered, so people in such a reality do not pay attention to their original weakness, and this failure to pay attention is completely pathological.</p>
<p>In the past, a German poet had a theory that art originated from people's play instinct, and many scholars were superstitious about this theory. Although this can be explained by using the remaining power of people's lives to tend towards art, it seems like a big mistake to treat people's entertainment desire and artistic desire as the same thing.</p>
<p>Art is not to comfort people but to strengthen people's will; it is not to increase interest but to make people think. It makes people go upward, makes people progress, and makes people more satisfied. It is not to soothe the bitterness of daily life with palliative means, but to give the strength of the root that can endure bitterness. In actual social life, it is not used to comfort the groaning and moaning updating, but to give the nutrients to eliminate the groaning and moaning. It is like a kind of incredible magic that teaches people that although the body is tired, the soul is not tired. Focusing on art is to open up a bright world for people. Art is to show people and the true picture of the myriad phenomena surrounding people, so that people can realize the true "beauty" at the bottom of this floating and impermanent phase that flows in the present world. It makes people deviate from the life limited to comrades as objects, and always keeps things above in their hearts, and makes life go upward. And it makes people grasp the meaning of the world. It does not require speculation, but makes it directly obtained. In the world, it is often the case that people who are clear about the ways of the world, who are well versed in human relationships, and who are insightful into the twists and turns of human affairs fully savor the meaning of the world. However, this is nothing more than a dictionary. Although it is valuable, it is only useful for people who own accumulated materials. The reason for wanting to keep this valuable material is still unknown. Starting from the unknown place, most people fall into low-level enlightenment, or simply continue this evil game and spend their lives. Art is a way to restore health to a world in this pathological state.</p>
<p>Conversely, there is no such powerful art, it is very low-level art. Art that is played with or caressed should not be called art.</p>
<p>Production and Construction</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>Published every Monday</p>
<p>In the industrial world, the psychology of self-confidence is very important, especially when the current industry is in a dangerous situation. Many people in charge of factories believe that Chinese industry, in this situation, can be said to have no hope. This psychology is because of a lack of self-confidence.</p>
<p>In fact, as long as we work hard, improve quality, and strive for construction, the products of Chinese industry can also be equal to the goods manufactured by advanced countries. Therefore, we should create a psychology of self-confidence through hard work, and start from the psychology of self-confidence to have a practical expression. After the quality of goods is improved, not only can they gain a foothold, but they can also develop rapidly.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Textile Industry Construction</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jian</p>
<p>The textile industry is the most important industry for people's livelihood. All daily clothing and supplies are required from this industry. Now, based on what the management office knows, the key points of my country's textile industry construction in the future are listed below, and I hope that industry leaders will give their corrections.</p>
<p>(A) Essential prerequisites for building the textile industry:</p>
<p>(1) First, require the government to do its best to resolve the current serious political problems, stop the civil war, and allow people to live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
<p>(2) Restore national water and land transportation as soon as possible to facilitate the exchange of materials. So that production can remain normal. And purchase new textile machines, and imitate them to increase production.</p>
<p>(3) Increase foreign exchange, and the import of textiles that can be woven independently should be reduced as much as possible to avoid threats.</p>
<p>(4) Encourage those who improve and invent in the textile industry and those who are enthusiastic about progress.</p>
<p>(5) Strive to restore the original overseas textile market and foundation, such as the Nanyang Islands.</p>
<p>(6) Labor and management work together to eliminate labor disputes, and strive to increase production to reach the standard and compete with other countries. At that time, according to the book "China's Destiny" compiled by Chairman Chiang, it will be possible to expand the 10 million spindles of textile machines that should be set up throughout the country in the future in a timely manner, so that the people of the whole country can be self-sufficient in clothing. The above are prerequisites.</p>
<p>(B) Key points of improvement and construction: The first is the psychological construction of people, which must be corrected:</p>
<p>After the victory of the Great War and the restoration of the country, material construction must be carried out as soon as possible, and psychological and spiritual construction must not be delayed. In today's arduous era of nation-building, our psychology and spirit should be based on serving the country and serving the society. Everything must be realistic and hardworking, and we must shoulder the arduous work after this glorious victory. Always with the purpose of "serving and serving," I especially hope that comrades who are engaged in this career will work together to thoroughly reform the current complicated psychological and spiritual construction.</p>
<p>(C) Use scientific methods to combine theory and practice; The theory of science clearly states that the progress of industry depends on the proper application of science. For example, some workers in a textile factory have a high level of education, but they still feel insufficient in practical experience, while others have experience but lack knowledge, so there is often "knowing what it is, but not knowing why it is." The former relies on their knowledge, and the latter relies on their experience, but they cannot be used together, so this is one of the reasons for their backwardness. The author believes that factories should attach employee training centers and technical training classes to increase the academic and technical skills of employees, and train them using the method of part-time work and part-time study so that general employees can combine theory and practice and have a clear understanding of the application of science.</p>
<p>(D) Mechanical maintenance and personnel management: "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If the tools are sharp, the job will be done well. This is an unchanging truth from ancient times to the present. The structure of textile machinery is complex. If the machinery is sophisticated, the production efficiency can be increased; maintenance is to maintain the machinery to increase its life, can give play to the efficiency of the machinery, and achieve the maximum amount of the best products. It is found that my country's textile machinery is almost entirely purchased from abroad, and the forms are complex and varied. Often, the machinery used in one factory has as many as six or seven names. Therefore, the difference in the organization makes management and use particularly inconvenient. Due to the difference in the components, if one is missing, it cannot be repaired. As a result, it takes a long time. Due to the difference in the organization, the use of tools is also difficult to generalize. Maintenance is inconvenient, and it is also difficult to attract maintenance talents who are proficient in various machines. The author believes that the machinery used in textiles in the future must be carefully selected and unified, and then the Chinese will imitate them themselves. This will not only benefit a lot from maintenance, but the entire textile industry wants to develop, and it must devote itself to this. (3) Increase the number of schools to cultivate textile talents: My country has a cultural history of four or five thousand years! It is much earlier than European and American countries, but it has not paid attention to science and engineering education, so it is difficult for the development of the entire national industry to reach a high level. The prosperity of the United Kingdom and the United States and the continuous progress of their textile industries are all because the people have received considerable education, especially paying more attention to science and engineering education. The creativity and invention of the British and Americans, and the spirit of the Japanese in being good at imitation, are all based on the high progress of science and engineering education. We cannot talk about creating profits and inventions, but at least we must have the ability to imitate others, and we should be cautious and work hard. At the same time, I hope that the government should increase the number of specialized schools to cultivate textile talents, such as state-owned textile factories should actively prepare to increase the number of textile schools in the short term so that those who are already employed but lack knowledge can seek opportunities for advancement. And at any time to cultivate the large number of textile talents needed in the future to solve the problem of lack.</p>
<h3>New Anesthetic</h3>
<p>The California State Medical University recently invented an anesthetic that allows chest surgery to be performed with an electric knife in the future. Anesthetics such as ether and propane are explosive. When using electricity, an electric spark must be used to close many small veins and arteries. Otherwise, ether and propane will cause the electric spark to explode in the patient's lungs. This new anesthetic is two extremely potent poisons, nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide) and curare (a poison used by South American natives to coat arrowheads, made from a certain plant). Nitrous oxide puts the patient to sleep, and curare paralyzes the patient's respiratory muscles.</p>
<p>A huge 90,000 kilovolt generator is being assembled in the United States in preparation for shipment to the South Markland Dnieper power plant in the Soviet Union. The machine was specially designed for the Soviet Union by the New York General Electric Company. A total of three units will be transported to Markland to replace those destroyed by the German army during the war. (Special correspondent of this newspaper from the New York Times)</p>
<h3>The Movement to Love National Products</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The movement to love national products has been launched by all parties and has begun to be promoted. This was explained in detail in the previous issue of this journal, and it is a movement to correct psychology, which will have a great impact on the future.</p>
<p>Chinese industry is really facing unprecedented difficulties, but if we can correct the wrong psychology of the public, and increase the sales of Chinese industrial products through the love of national products, even if we do not revive Chinese industry, we may be able to take the movement to love national products as a starting point.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Third, the quality of raw materials must always be consistent and should not be changed:</p>
<p>The most taboo thing in manufacturing and selling goods is the decline in the quality of goods. At the beginning of the first issue, the quality was very good, but later, it gradually declined. The reason for the decline in quality is often that it is impossible to purchase the same raw materials as the first batch for a while (because they were collected by others and could not be bought for a while, or because the price of raw materials increased, they had to use the next grade of raw materials). The result of the decline in quality is often that sales are getting worse and worse, and even the goods cannot be sold.</p>
<p>Many manufacturing plants, such as pharmaceutical factories, must first perform chemical tests when purchasing raw materials, and only accept them if the chemical tests are qualified. Many original raw materials cannot be unsealed for chemical testing, so they can only be purchased from reliable experts and reliable manufacturers.</p>
<p>Due to the above three points, it can be proved that raw materials have a great relationship with the sales of goods and the future of the company, so it is natural to be cautious when purchasing raw materials.</p>
<p>The raw materials mentioned here include various raw materials used in manufacturing plants, and the decoration of goods. Such as glass bottles, etc., can also be applied. The principle mentioned here, according to the results of expert research, a manufacturing plant should not make too many types of goods. It may be better to manufacture a few types first, and then add new products after the sales are smooth and the foundation is stable. If many goods are manufactured at the same time, it will require many different raw materials and decorations, and the funds will be scattered. In case the goods cannot be sold well, the funds will be trapped, especially the decorations, which are difficult to sell, and there is no hope of recovering the money after it is paid out.</p>
<p>The Work of Purchasing Materials</p>
<p>The relationship between raw materials and goods has been mentioned above, and now we will talk about the method of purchasing materials.</p>
<p>Those who are in charge of purchasing materials may be a purchasing committee, or a purchasing director, who is responsible for the matter, but the principle of purchasing materials is the same.</p>
<p>A person in charge of purchasing materials must possess the following conditions in order to make his purchasing work produce excellent results: 1. Familiar with the market situation: How much inventory is there in the market for various raw materials (that is, how much quantity is there in the market in total)? Their consumption and the rise and fall of market prices should be investigated in detail. Therefore, a person in charge of purchasing materials should frequently contact all relevant parties so that he can obtain relatively rapid and reliable information, which can provide a lot of convenience in the purchasing work.</p>
<p>2. Strong judgment: After obtaining information, whether to purchase immediately and how much to purchase should be decided immediately, so a person in charge must have strong judgment. When the molten iron of the large furnace of the Ford Motor Factory is poured out, sparks fly in all directions. Due to the shortage of steel supply, the Ford steel plant is working day and night to increase production to meet the needs. (Special correspondent of this newspaper from the New York Times)</p>

<h3>The Need for Hard Work</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>"We should investigate where our shortcomings lie. Is it talent? Knowledge? Then, we should strive to overcome them. Perhaps we will need to endure five or ten more years of hardship, but if we only endure hardship without exploration and research, the period of hardship will only be prolonged. Our cultural and educational circles should clench their teeth during these five or ten years…"</p>
<p>The above is a conclusion drawn by Mr. Hu Shih, upon his return to Shanghai after nine years abroad, during his first public speech.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the student strikes and worker strikes in Shanghai were surging. Everyone was in no mood to study. I remember a German geometry professor advising us not to shout and clamor乱嚷乱呌. He said that such clamoring was not only not patriotic but harmful to the country. He said: After Germany was defeated in the First World War, the whole country, from top to bottom, did not shout or clamor. Everyone silently buried themselves in hard work. Students studied and researched desperately, and workers worked desperately. They usually worked eight hours a day, but at that time, they worked almost twelve hours. Fifteen years of hard work restored the country's strength, and we were no longer afraid of any foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Today, our war of resistance has been won, and we are respectfully one of the four major powers. But honestly, we are so ashamed! Comparing anything with others, we are ashamed beyond words. Japan is now a defeated country. Friends who have returned from Tokyo say that they do not have the emotions of mourning their parents. They have rallied their spirits to do all kinds of work. Silk exports have already recovered, many factories have gradually started operating, and food shortages are addressed by tightening their belts and saving, while also stepping up production and inventing various substitutes to supplement it. The atmosphere of studying is even more intense. No matter what political party, all are starting with restoring national strength. It is not alarmist to say that if our generation does not strive and lay a solid foundation, another Sino-Japanese war might occur in ten or twenty years. At that time, it will be difficult for us to encounter such good luck as we have now. Therefore, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, as Mr. Hu Shih said, we should clench our teeth and bury ourselves in hard work during these five or ten years!</p>
<h3>"Speculating on the Black Market" - Recent Events in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>The term "official price" 公價 seems to be a product of this war, appearing in the world at the same time as the term "rationing" 配給. Black markets, however, have existed since ancient times and did not begin today. But they flourished during the previous World War and were rampant during this war. The degree of rampancy was worse than the plague. Not only were large cities universally infected with this suffering, but even remote rural areas were also widely covered with poisonous bacteria and growing slowly. To this day, its influence has not diminished slightly.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, like other cities, has almost turned even the air into a black market. The black market controls the entire market, and the black market has permeated the blood of every citizen; from the moment each citizen opens their eyes in the morning until they close them again at night, if they haven't made a circuit in the black market that day, their life will have some imperfections, perhaps some indispensable imperfections.</p>
<p>When Hong Kong was occupied, the black market was controlled by the Japanese, as black as a flock of crows, and as dark as the darkest night. After the Japanese were locked up in Stanley, the Chinese and British copied a set of old articles from the Japanese, added some genius creations, and the Hong Kong black market changed from an imperialist black market to a democratic black market. It also flourished a lot, with imported goods brought in by warships, and imported goods almost included everything needed for life. But they were only military supplies. Later, even British and American goods became black market goods. The black market dominates the people, and the black market also prospers today's Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Then there was the official price 公價, and the government said, "Anything exceeding the official price is the black market." Gradually, the government expanded its control from rice and grain.</p>
<p>——Now, the Hong Kong government declares that it will attack the black market and have a decisive battle with the black market.</p>
<p>The first step in the attack or decisive battle is to send out "assault vehicles" 衝鋒車 to arrest black market hawkers. The hawkers fly all over the streets, fly away and then gather again. Reassembling, there is a black market, which makes it even more of a black market. The second step is to punish black market shops. The government authorizes courts or judges to enforce the black market regulations against shops selling black market goods. The first time a shop sells black market goods, it is punished with a month of closure and suspension of business, then six months, but only targeting cigarettes and alcohol. The Jin Cheng Restaurant was the first to be punished, but it was only fined and not closed, because its crime occurred before the regulations were announced, and the judge or court had not yet received the authority granted by the government.</p>
<p>But the black market doesn't seem to care about this at all. The government is launching its attack, but the black market is still the black market today.</p>
<p>The black market is organized. According to government investigations and public statements, the black market organization has a spy network to find out the types of goods arriving in Hong Kong, and directly purchase goods from importers or wholesalers, but not by forced purchases, but by threatening fair transactions. The fairness of the transaction can allow importers or wholesalers to obtain considerable profits. After the black market gang gets the goods, they hand them over to hawkers to sell. The hawkers then pay the black market gang considerable profits, and the hawkers charge customers considerable profits. With the layers of added profits, only consumers feel that the burden is too heavy.</p>
<p>The black market organization is tight-knit and has great latent power. Sometimes, even goods with official prices are controlled by them, which means that goods with official prices are snatched up, and consumers have no choice but to seek them from the black market.</p>
<p>The black market occupies the entire territory of Hong Kong, even the airspace. People in Hong Kong are getting everything they need from the black market. But some people in Hong Kong are indifferent, some don't even know what a black market is, and some go to "eat" the black market.</p>
<p>——Eating the black market can be quite impressive.</p>
<p>There are even those who use the black market to create another black market or double black market goods, and this is called "speculating on the black market".</p>
<p>So, the world now has two symbols: one is the "black market" and the other is the "atom".</p>
<h3>Comic Strip - Sanmao Joins the Army (66)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>The Fool</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>"The so-called fool" thinker Chuan Baikun once explained it this way: "A person who kicks aside considerations of personal gain and loss, and acts solely according to their own pure and unadorned heart, is definitely not someone who seeks temporary ease or just gets by. Instead, they are able to think fundamentally and thoroughly about everything, and can implement the answer in their own environment. They are able to constantly add new things to the burning flame of life, so they are also unwilling to be self-satisfied."</p>
<p>It seems that "similar fools" are rarely found in this profit-driven society, I think few people are willing to be that; but thinking carefully, the world is always being constantly improved by the "fool's" strength; humankind's ability to evolve to this point today is because there are many fools, big and small, working hard. If not, who knows what the world would be like!</p>
<p>If there were no Copernicus, Darwin, and many tireless fools, perhaps the world would still be ruled by the forces of superstition. If it weren't for 　　this fool who was not afraid of authority and created the theory of the social contract, perhaps the common people would still be living an inhuman life under feudal power. If China had not sacrificed many fools in the repeatedly failed revolutions, perhaps our country would not be a republic today. However, times have changed, and such fools have become historical figures. We don't need to expect them to reappear like ghosts 幽　. Everyone should make up their mind to start from themselves. Even if we can't be a big fool, we should still be a small fool. If we can't be a hundred-point fool, we should at least be a sixty-point fool. But don't ever try to be a one hundred and twenty-point smart person. Look at those smart people like Wang Jingwei, like speculative profiteers, who 　can say they aren't smart? But what have they contributed to China and to mankind? What are their consequences? So, I would like to respectfully say it again: "I hope everyone can be a useful fool." The more fools, the more hope there is for China, and the more humankind will evolve!</p>
<h3>Please, British Tram Company, Take a Look at Others!</h3>
<p>— Xia Jiansheng</p>
<p>Amidst the voices of criticism and dissatisfaction with the tram today, I do not intend to deliberately go against the grain and praise the French Tram. Frankly speaking, it does have the following advantages:</p>
<p>Regarding vehicles: French Line 2 (1, 5, 10) trams, at any station, except for special reasons, the tram will definitely arrive within three minutes, and the three lines come in sequence. Except for occasional differences due to the length of the journey, within ten minutes, the line you need will arrive. After arriving at the station, the door will definitely open, but because the vehicle capacity is limited, some passengers will inevitably be excluded from the door, but don't worry, within ten minutes, the line you need will come again.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the morality of conductors: the French are also more disciplined and never pocket money. However, in crowded or rushed situations, there may be occasional forgetfulness. But if you mention it, they will immediately find it for you. I have had this experience many times and it is definitely correct.</p>
<p>The advantages of the French tram are nothing more than the large number of cars, proper allocation, and serious operation. We hope that the British Tram Company authorities will: take a look at others!</p>
<h3>Looking at One's Reflection and Feeling Sorry for Oneself</h3>
<p>— Chang Gong</p>
<p>Lily is a beautiful, unmarried nurse. After she came to my house three times, I found that she was quite interested in the mirror. I put on a "seeing nothing" pose and secretly made an interesting record:</p>
<p>In a corner of my living room is an old-fashioned dressing table with an oval mirror in the middle that can reflect half of the body. As soon as Lily entered the door, she took her purse to this table, and then faced the mirror, greeting the people in the room while brushing her soft hair on her shoulders.</p>
<p>The second time she looked in the mirror was about ten minutes later. She ran to the table, reached into her purse to take out a package of "Xiao Zhi Long" 消治龍 pills, and glanced at Lily in the mirror.</p>
<p>The subsequent times varied in length because the living room was too small, and our Lily was not used to sitting for long. Her slender body stood up, and after moving slightly, she and that lovely mirror formed parallel lines. Lily stood in the posture of a "willow in the wind", chatting for about three minutes, and glancing sideways at the mirror no less than three times.</p>
<p>My sister suddenly talked about the various hair styles, which naturally aroused Lily's high interest. She simply stood in front of the mirror and compared them for a full three and a half minutes.</p>
<p>My sister was busy going to the kitchen to cook, and I also quietly went to the back room, which was not lit all day, to fumble around for a while. Lily was left alone in the living room. Suddenly, I looked up and saw Lily leaning over the table through the small window facing the dressing table, enjoying the pleasure of "looking around freely". I remember reading in a passage by Gorky: when a person is alone in a room, they will let out all the most innocent and ridiculous movements, which is a kind of liberation of human nature. Therefore, I thought that Lily must have obtained this kind of "liberation of nature" at this time. It was hateful that in less than two minutes, my sister's slippers came Xiang'ed from the hallway, and Lily had to sadly re-enter the restraints of the human world and quickly left the mirror.</p>
<p>After the meal, after washing her face, the脂粉 powder on Lily's face was patchy and uneven. This time, she openly and clearly aligned herself with the mirror and applied it extensively. When she left, she had to take the purse on the table. Taking the purse inevitably meant facing forward and getting one last close look at the mirror, which could be said to be quite fortunate, before leaving gracefully.</p>
<p>Lily stayed at my house for a total of two and a half hours between coming and going.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, my recording responsibility can be considered complete. If readers are interested, you may wish to take the trouble to calculate: How many times did Lily look in the mirror in these two and a half hours? On average, how many minutes was it per time? If she continues like this, in total, how much of her life will be spent on the mirror?</p>
<h3>New Interpretations of Old Phrases</h3>
<p>— Liu Qi</p>
<p>"Scholars have no conduct" 文人無行—Scholars are weak and refined, and cannot squeeze onto the tram. Scholars are shy and timid, and cannot afford to ride a rickshaw. Therefore, the "conduct" 行 of scholars is a problem. Hence, "scholars have no conduct."</p>
<p>"Press forward courageously" 勇往直前—This refers to the tram passing the station without stopping.</p>
<p>"Aiming at the highest, one only attains the average; aiming at the average, one attains the below." 取法乎上，僅得乎中；取法乎中；則得乎下。—One must desperately squeeze to get into the tram; if one is squeezed into the crowd, then one has no choice but to wait for the next tram.</p>
<p>"If you don't do it, don't stop." 一不做，二不休—Trams on Route 2 come in an endless stream; Route 1 seems to have stopped altogether. This is what is meant by "If you don't do it, don't stop."</p>
<p>"The wise go beyond, the foolish fall short." 知者過之，愚者不及也—Knowledgeable people drive the bus past the bus stop before stopping, thus the fools can't catch up.</p>
<p>"The gain does not compensate for the loss" 得不償失—This refers to getting on the tram but discovering that your wallet is gone.</p>
<p>"Seizing the initiative by making a statement" 先聲奪人—The tram conductor first declares to the passengers, "Pay your fare slowly!" before collecting the money and leaving.</p>
<h3>An Encounter with Mr. Lang Jingshan</h3>
<p>— Fan Tu</p>
<p>One hot afternoon, I met the famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan on the second floor of the Xin Ya Restaurant.</p>
<p>Tall, with a calm demeanor, wearing a long gray silk gown, he spoke without revealing his emotions, fully demonstrating the demeanor of a cultivated artist.</p>
<p>After sitting down, the reporter asked him: "I heard that Mr. Lang is going abroad recently"?</p>
<p>"There is such a thing," he said with a smile. "An American friend wrote to invite me to give lectures on photographic art, aimed at their P.S.A., which is an association of photographic comrades, as well as many women's groups. Recently, Gu Brand Petroleum Company and others are preparing to jointly hold an international aviation photography competition on October 5th and have also written to invite me to be a judge. However, the time to handle passport procedures is already too late, and I probably won't be able to go abroad until next spring. At that time, I also plan to bring some of my latest works to hold an exhibition."</p>
<p>Mr. Lang took out several letters from them to show the reporter and said that his works had already been exhibited in the United States more than thirty times.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese photography community, he said that what is lacking is organization.</p>
<p>"This organization is very necessary for international publicity or for connecting emotions. For example, the Japanese are smarter than us in this regard. They try their best to use photos to publicize the losses they suffered during the war, so the relief they received is much more generous than ours. On the contrary, we ourselves have very few works that play a role internationally. Instead, some foreigners have taken many photos in China to publicize for us!" He took out a Chinese painting collection published in London, which was full of works by foreign photographers.</p>
<p>He also told the reporter that someone in the United States recently wrote to him asking for photos of various aspects of China. He is trying to collect them and is preparing to unite the photography community to form a kind of academic group.</p>
<p>"Finally," Mr. Lang especially emphasized, "We cannot manufacture photographic materials ourselves, which is a very serious problem, especially in the past during the War of Resistance, we felt great pain. Therefore, I am also thinking about ways to address this, at least to see if we can ask foreign companies to help us invest and operate together, and then gradually achieve self-reliance."</p>
<p>When the reporter bid farewell, he kindly gave me a recent work, which was a male lion photographed in an animal enclosure, combined with the background of Mount Emei.</p>
