<h3 id="c1">國大討論議事規則　第一二三章已順利今晨舉行 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕大會主席團廿五日晚開第三次會議，通過兩事，（一）關於第二次大會日期案，決議定於十一月廿六日上午九時舉行，並推定于代表右任担任大會主席。（二）關於民主社會黨推定李大明，徐傅霖兩代表爲主席團案，決議提出第二次大會報吿。至於廿五日大會關於議事規則草案第四章之修正意見至深大，猶在分口頭與書面兩類歸納中，以期於廿六日晨第二决大會中提出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕廿五日下午三時廿分，國大續開大會，仍由蔣主席主持，洪友蘭報吿在塲人數一〇七〇人後，蔣主席即請主席團推選之主席胡適報吿午間主席團會議之決定稱：「對討論議事規則之方式，第二次主席團會議後，曾再舉行一談話會，認爲如另組審查委員會召集費時，運用困難，前次討論主席團候選人產生方式，審查小組多爲年高德劭之代表，不喜多發言，故主張逕由大會分章討論，本日上午大會，旣決議先付審查，經主席團於中午臨時集會討論後，以另組審委會有事實上之困難，決定向大會建議，由全體審查會先予審查，當吾請公決」。胡氏報吿畢，豫區代表何佛情等相繼發言，略謂：主席團之決議，不能推翻大會決議，應維持大會上午決議，由各單位推舉代表審查，至此，蔣主席起立解釋稱：「主席團之建議，並非推翻大會之決議，僅係以主席團之意見，徴求大會意見，大會開會，一方固應廣徵意見，一方亦應顧及時間，以全體審查會代替小組審查會，大家發言之機會更多，此項建議實乃絕對民主者，可吾再以此項意見表一次」，當經會衆鼓堂贊成，表決結果，贊成者七五七人多數通過，乃於下午三時四十分開始全體審查會，進行分章討論，請求發言者又紛紛上主席台，第一章「總則」，提出意見者，有請將代表在會內言論對外不負責任一點在議事規則中加列者，有提議大會代表席决不必再加調整，請將第五條取銷或修定者，前者因大會組織法中已有聲明，後者依主席團意見，調整座次，有事實之需要，均未成立，第一章依原文通過。第二章「代表資格之審查」，僅於二一代表建議對代表之有附逆行爲者，應加以嚴格辯解之審查後，順利通過·第三章「開會」，亦僅關於第十四條代表退席，對法定人數不影響一點，有請對憲法表決之法定人數，作特別之規定者，因大會組織法已有明文，經表決以七二九人贊成（在塲一二四九人）通過維持原案。</p>
<p>討論「提案」一章　各代表踴躍發言</p>
<p>至此，第四章「提案」開始討論，會場形勢　見緊張，各代表醬面提出意見或口頭表達意見者，達八十餘人，踴躍發言，慷慨陳詞，全章十一條中除第廿一·廿三·廿五·廿七·廿八等五條外，均多修正意見，歸納各代表發言大意，略爲第十八條對議案之性質不應加以狹隘之限制，應改爲議案可由各代表自由提出，第十九條憲法施行日期之議案，依組織法應由大會代表提出，政府提出憲草之程序，應作詳盡合法之規定，以尊重全國最高政權機關國民大會之權力，觀諸世界各民主國制憲史，憲草不以國民政府提出者爲限，第廿條關於憲草及行憲日期修正案，再提出不必如此特別規定，第廿二條憲草之審查雖云分章設組，其組別應予明列，第廿四條對提出憲草修正案之連署人數應減少及參加審查各組代表對本組審查結果不得再提修正案一點，旣不民主，又不合理，蓋小組中之少數意見，可能爲大會中之多數意見，應將此項限制取銷，或爲有條件之修正，使各審查小組中持少數意見者，有保留意見在大會中發抒之機曾，第廿六條臨時動議須爲書面者，並須徵得一百人以上之連署一點，未顧及事實，不合理，臨時動議應不限於書面，一百人應減至最少數目，關於此章，各代表提出之意見達百餘項，大會於下午四時四十五分至五時十五分曾一度休息，直至六時十分，討論方吿結束，蔣主席宣佈「關於第四章之多項意見，於散會後由主席團開會加以歸納，提出廿六日大會」。最後，洪蘭友報吿：「會後請主席團全體主席至主席台後休息室集會，第二次大會時間，由主席團決定後，再行通知」，至六時十五分散會，時方暮色蒼茫，大雨滂沱，此充滿民主作風之首次大會，於焉結束。</p>
<h3 id="c2">上午大會詳情 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國民大會首决大會，廿五日上午十時十五分開始舉行，岑寂兩日之國府大道及國民大會堂，又形熱閙。十時十二分，蔣主席步入主席台就坐，洪蘭友秘書長報吿報到代表一六〇四人，出席代表一二四八人，已足法定人數，宣吿開會，全體肅立，由蔣主席領導行禮如儀，並爲開國先烈及抗戰陣亡將士，死難同胞默禱致敬後，即由報吿員宣讀第四次預備會議紀錄及代表請假函電，洪秘書長報吿第二次主席團會議決定事項：（一）主席團分組辦法及名單（見二十五日本報，僅第一組周雍能及第五組丁惟汾互調，餘無更動）。（二）國民大會旁聽規則。（三）據孫代表慕迦等五十一人暨國民大會候補人聯誼會及重慶分會，四川分會，河南等國民大會候補人李定等請求允許代表侯補人列席，經查本大會組織法並無此項規定，且會塲席次有限，所請應無庸議。</p>
<h3 id="c3">滬團管區司令　短期內可產生 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕兵役當局對滬市役政主管人員之遴選，極爲鄭重。現第二期兵役人員訓練班已結業，滬團管區司令人選，短期即可產生。</p>
<h3 id="c4">武肇煦意見 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>旋蔣主席起立，請主席團第一組各主席登台，至此，樓廂一七七六座晋區代表武肇煦起立發言，申述意見兩點：「（一）廿三日蔣主席與民社黨張君勱先生正式交換之函件巾，『政協憲草審議會所修改之憲草，在國大之內，各方應負責使其通過」一點，實達反民主原則，任何黨派不能以其所屬意之憲草强迫國民大會接受，（二）議事規則草案中民主成分很少，尤其『提案』一章，限制吾人意見之自由發揮，影響舉國期望之五權憲法，三民主義之憲章之制訂，請大會同人注意此重要之程序法以免發言機會被剝奪」。武詞畢，蔣主席起謂：「對余與張先生之信件交換，乃另外一回事，移時當有說明，現依議事“程，將議事規則草案宣讀一過後，開始討論」。報吿員宣讀草案畢，洪秘書長復對草案加以說明：「（一）程序法乃根據母法訂定母法運用之具體要點者，國大組織法中已規定，本規則　案不重列，亦不更改，（二）規則草案係列舉重點，以免繁瑣，（三）規則草案孫依據民權初步，參酌各國議事規則擬訂，（四）對發言申請之限制規定，乃因會塲大，代表多，爲避免秩序混亂，並保障發言機會均等，故明列法內」。繼對各章重點用意加以闡明，此際爲十一時十分，請求發言雪片般飛上主席台，蔣主席宣吿休息。</p>
<h3 id="c5">蔣主席答復 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>十一時三十分繼續開會，首由蔣主席答覆武代表肇煦之意見謂：「余與張先生交換函件乃會外之事，與大會事務無關，政協閉幕之際，余即曾聲明，關於修正憲草之成立一事，對黨員可予約束，對國大則無權過問（鼓掌），此次交換函件，余係以國民黨總裁名義行文，並僅限於國民黨與民社黨兩黨之間，對大會並無的束力，至於議事規則之中民主成分太少一點，大家可儘量討論修正，但民主必須在法律之下始得成立，國父亦曾如是昭示吾人，希諸位代表對所有付諸討論者，於合法範圍內熱烈發抒意見，以期盡善盡　（大鼓掌）」。繼由豫區代表孫劍岷發言請「制定憲法不能閉門造車，須聽取各地代表報吿民意及政府各部之施政報告，但亦不能感情用事，執拗成見，必須具熱心，憑良心，爲國爲民，制定百年大法」。至此，蔣主席宣吿「如今只討論議事規則草案之討論方式，請就此發言，勿出題外」。一時意見紛紜，展開熱烈辯論，最後付諸表決，鄂區代表孔庚「先付審查後再行討論」之意見，以七三一粟通過，蔣主席起謂：「審查之辦法，係主席團決定後，下午報吿」，洪秘書長乃起立報吿，請各主席團代表集台會議室開會，下午三時繼續舉行大會，十二時正散會。</p>
<h3 id="c6">議事規則一二三章　國大首次會議通過之全文 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕安東方面連繫中韓交通之鴨緣江鐵橋，被雙方封鎖後，已無國際性來往。廿三日朝鮮北部蘇聯佔領軍最高司令部派遣代表過江至安東，訪晤趙公武司令，作非正式招待會，幷談及當地各項問題，趙氏對可能協力方面，已慨然允之，蘇使者滿意而返。趙氏幷擬最近派警備司令部參謀長雷克文代表，至鮮北作正式之訪問。蘇方當局表示：中共問題屬於中國內部事，決不因中共而絲毫影響中蘇邦交。</p>
<h3 id="c8">王寵惠談新憲章　係根據政協原則擬成者　行政制度一章最關重要 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日雷〕中華民國憲草修正案整理人王寵惠，廿五日語本報記者，國家之憲法愈能得大多數人民接受愈好，至少亦須爲多數人民所滿意。在民主制度下，各人皆可發表其意見，討論憲法，尤其如此，有好意見，可儘量提出，惟盼討論者有結果，旣經多數決定後，更盼各方能予遵行。此次憲草修正案，係根據政協原則擬成者，爲一種綜合性產品，與依據總理遺敎擬成之五五憲草當有不同，惟有一點須指出，即各國之憲法大多爲折衷各方意見擬成者，欲求一個能爲一種思想所貫澈之憲法實非易事。美國制憲時，爭執頗烈，其憲法即爲折衷各方意見擬成者。法國新憲法之制定，亦非僅根據一黨之主張。王氏談及新憲草中最受人注意之行政對立法負責問題稱：新的制度，爲介乎總統制與內閣制間之一種新創制度，良以內閣制時時倒閣，對需要安定之中國，似不相宜，而實行總統制，又恐執政者隨意行事，二者折中，乃有新制之擬議。此章關係重要，蓋政治能否推動與如何推動，與之皆有關係。關於地方與中央一章，亦有一種新擬議，此章係根據均權原則而草擬，中央與地方權限，經明白規定後，除介乎兩可之間始有爭執發生，惟此種情形到底不多。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕中華民國憲草修正案之提出國大，恐須俟議事規則在國大通過以後。</p>
<h3 id="c9">張君勳從事著述 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>民社黨代表數人抵京</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勱氏來滬後，深居簡出，往訪之客，僅接見新自九江歸來之陳光甫氏一人，範園寓所，亦已重門深鎖，並下百華窗，令人不禁回憶一月之車馬盈門，張氏決從事著述，去北平之期未定。</p>
<p>民主社會黨發言孫寳毅昨稱：民主同盟廿四日在京記者招待會上，旣已明白宣稱民社黨考慮退盟，則民社黨亦惟有即作退盟之考慮而已。君勱先生曾告彼稱：如民主與和平得同時宣現，自屬最佳，如和平一時不能實現，而民主仍能向前一步，則民社黨仍不願放棄促民主前進一步之機會，民社黨有民社黨之立塲，故決定有條件的參加國大。關於憲草修正案，孫氏稱：各界見仁見智，批評自所不免，大公報曾對基本國策一章譏爲口號，殊不知此一章實皆根據周恩來氏之意見，當時係周氏口述，由人逐字筆錄者。至第一章第一條稱：「中華民國基於三民主義，爲民有民治民享之民主共和國」其中「民有民治民享」一語，有人批評爲係多餘，實則亦係根據當年協議而來，並非起草者杜撰也。記者詢以民盟不日將在滬開會，張瀾並將來滬主持，屆時民社黨之地位如何？孫氏答稱：開會時民社黨能否接獲請柬，目前亦正復難說。昔年靑年黨脫離民盟時，形式上亦祇民盟於開會時不加邀請而已。孫氏並稱：民社黨當不致發表若何答覆民盟之文吿。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠</p>
<p>首次大會零星紀實</p>
<p>二十五日國大首次大會，由蔣主席親自主持，他穿着草黃色軍裝，坐在主席台正中底高背椅上，領章上的金星，國大代表的金徽，和朱紅色主席團佩條上的金字，在水銀燈的强光下閃鑠着，會程中幾次緊張的塲面，都賴蔣主席的鎭定堅決和坐在他左邊的洪秘書長的靈活處理，順利過去，全會經過充滿了民主的成份，在不同中求大同。蔣主席請主席團第一組各位主席登主席台時，洪秘書長一再重述，第一批上去的是坐在樓下的，第一個上去的是藍袍玄褂金邊眼鏡的胡適，第二批是坐在樓上的面團體碩穿灰西裝的孔祥熈走在前面，谷正綱和黃國書在後面謙讓着，最後一個上去的是頭戴絲絨小帽，着一身藏靑色　式西裝，年靑精幹的阿哈買提江，丁惟汾請辭了，沒上去。</p>
<p>王立文，費俠，包德明三位女代表，坐在一道兒閑聊天，王對費說：「還是少講話吧」，包說：「得一個發言機會，員不容易」。</p>
<p>在參政會就以敢說話，會說話著稱的武和　（　煦），第一個　　，放了兩砲，一砲質問蔣主席，一砲提醒會衆，蔣主席坐在那兒拈　　後，站起來和和氣氣地加以解　，却博得了不少掌聲。</p>
<p>某代表穿着整齊的海軍制服，在休息時間碰到陳誠，恭恭敬敬地打一個四十五度的鞠躬，陳誠還　後，笑了笑。</p>
<p>休息時間：孫科和王　惠坐在休息室裏吃茶點，大講廣東話，有一個記者在旁邊問他的同業：「孫院長來沒有」？</p>
<p>白崇　永遠是記者競爭的對象，休息時間，又被外埠到京的新聞記者包圍了題字簽各，「請寫上報名」！「請敎貴報」？</p>
<p>關於對議事規則革案討論方式一點，大家紛紛發言，銀髯　的孔庚，第一次走上發言台，主席請他把「請求發當」繳上去，按秩序等候發言。休息後，輪到他發言了，他主張請各單位推代表一二人先開會，予以審查歸納意見後，再由大會討論「這是我七入年來在參政會得的經騐，不然車發言，西發言，把會場弄亂了，同時是國家元首的蔣主席太不敬了」。</p>
<p>童山灌溉的段劍岷，得到發言機會時，慷慨陳述意見，時間已到，洪秘書長却忘了撳鈴，蔣主席看看錶，招呼一下，才丁鈴鈴……。</p>
<p>表決討論方式時，一共有三個意見，贊成分章討論的六九八人，差半張票不及出席人數「一三九七」之半，孔祥熈添一張，過了半數，但會衆還要求把另兩個意見繼續表決，結果，贊成大體討論的一四六人，表決器上的燈火疏疏朗朗，贊成先付審查的七三一，表決器上密繁繁滿天星斗，孔老先生終於獲勝了。</p>
<p>國大午後續開大會，胡適代表主席國，報告午間集會決定建議後，一時衆議紛紛，不可開交，蔣主席立起來說：「慢慢來讓我先說明一下，請等會兒再說」，等他入情人理地說明後，也就風平浪靜了。</p>
<p>議事規則草案順利通過三章後，第四章一開始，便覺不凡，閩工代表陳彤洲站起來，「主席，四六五號請求發言」，「精等一等」，「這是審查會，我的話要在草案第三四章中間講，請准許我說」，「不是不准你發會請等宣讀草案原文後再說」，主席的和藹鎭定，使他又坐了下去。</p>
<p>關於第四章，發言者多至不可勝數，洪秘書長兩次報吿「請求發言太多，能代讀者，請不要說了，如有補充，也請依次序來」，後來大家疲勞了，講話的人少了，只聽洪秘書長以沉着的聲音打着揚州官話，在宣讀書面意見。</p>
<p>許多代表喉嚨特別大，把擴音器震得哇哇呌，洪秘書長無奈，加以講解說：「使用擴音器，遠近距離要適中，高低位置要調節，聲音大小尤其要能控制，請谷位注意」。但過了不久，某某代表又大喊大呌，全塲聽不淸他說些什麼，哭笑不得。洪秘書長等他喊過後，又謙和的說：「各位注意：聲音不好，太大，太高，太大，太高，不好聽」！</p>
<p>下午休息時間，羅術代表拿了一張紙，到處找人簽名，記者跑上去問：「羅先生一定有什麼高見」？他運忙說：「沒有，沒有，這是參政會的事；吿訴你一個消息：參政員聯誼會下星期可以成立」。</p>
<p>鬚髮眉雪白的山西區代表劉懷　，對十八十九兩條發言，語氣和平，有條不紊，取譬確切近情，娓娓道來，博得一致讚佳，　「都說此老有道理」。</p>
<p>主席台左面梯階上，滿是記者，男的女的，紅的綠的，瘦的胖的，坐的靠的，是大會場里排列　最複雜，頂自然的一角。</p>
<p>大會至天黑下來才散，會堂外面大雨如注，大家塞在大門口和走廊下，大有「行不得也」之概，一位同集說「疲勞轟炸開始了，吃不消」！</p>

<h3 id="c15">闡明中美商約精神　司使特發表聲明　對中國之主權無順害 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美駐華大使司徒雷登，昨日上午十時在漢彌登大厦美新聞處記者招待會席間，對中美商約引起誤會事，發表重要聲明如次二　中國報紙對最近成立之中美友好通商航海條約的討論，顯示他們對於條約所給予中美兩國的權利與特權的性質與範圍，誤會頗多，若干中國報紙不合理的指出美國已將不平等條件加諸中國，這條約決不是這樣的。自一九四三年在華治外法權條約取消後，巳產生一種空隙，這條約就是用來塡補這空隙的。</p>
<p>針對關　對國係</p>
<p>爲了規定這兩主權國家人民在彼此領土內所應享的便利，這種約條是需要的；目前在國與國之間，有很多同樣性質的條約存在，它們成立了一種法律上的組織，而在逍組織內，國與國之間很正常的維持友好的接觸和貿易上的活動。一九四三年的中美條約規定了締結這一次的條約，因爲在華治外法權的廢止，需要一稱基本條約來代替，針對兩國業巳變更的關係，並且，調整兩國人民在彼此領土內所需要實行的日常生活。舉一個例子，這條約准許兩國任何一國的人民，在彼此領土內游歷與居住，以及進行商業·敎育·宗敎·和慈善工作。這條約對於包括多方面用途的土地租借與所有權，也有規定。</p>
<p>如果沒有這樣的一個條約，那末兩國人民彼此就沒有進行這麼許多活動的基礎。這個條約有這樣的基本重要性。這個條約對於中國和中國的公民，如同對於美國和美國的公民一樣重要。無疑的，中國對於她希望進行有利交易的其他各國也須訂立類似的條約。</p>
<p>不確預　正的言</p>
<p>一部份中國報紙，對於條約裏面的條件，尤其關於最惠國一款，發生了誤會，因而引起了不正確的預言：以爲這個條約是一速串新的不平等條約的開始，道是不正確的。事實是最惠國這一個條規是包括在近代兩個平等地位國家的一切通商條約裏面的。</p>
<p>例如：一個予對方以最惠國待遇的國家，關於關稅或航海權方面，並沒有另定特種稅則的義務，也沒有允許外國船隻無限制駛入內地與沿海水道的義務。在中美條約之下，中國並下喪失其關稅自主或控制航運及對外貿易的權限，中國政府最近頒佈的對外貿易章程就是這一事實的最充分的證明。</p>
<p>美國並不期望中國犧牲其主權或妥協，而條約中也絕對沒有這樣的規定，但條約內確切規定在華的美國人和在美的中國人不得受歧視的待遇，彼此在對方的國內，都享受合理的和必要的權利和便利。</p>
<p>美國並不想要，也沒有得到，在華的特殊權利。</p>

<p>〔本報天津廿五日電〕馬帥來，津經三盤桓後，廿五日下午二時飛平。馬帥此行顯甚愉快，渠曾謂：常重遊於廿年前所寓之街區時，舊日景色宛在目前，殊感欣然。馬帥於某茶會中表示：年來斯作努力已吿失敗，對和談前途則未加推論，且無一語關涉政治，渠希望國人認淸現實，導國家於康途。據悉：曾有一語述及「宣傳」，謂美國對宣傳極爲鄭重。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕據傳，馬特使即自平返京，可能將由京赴延安一行，藉與毛澤東見面，作政府與中共間商談之最後努力。日前外傳毛將赴佳木斯及中共總部亦將遷移等說，據中共發言人表示，此爲不可能之事，蓋中共本身現無飛機，且延安遷移將使政治上失却重心也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二十五日電〕中法談判正式進行已逾兩週，各界人士對其進度均極重視。記者爲明瞭眞象，特走訪外交部發言人情報司長何鳳山，詢以若千問題，承答頗詳，茲誌問答如后：</p>
<p>問：此次中法談判係根據何種條約？</p>
<p>答：係根據本年二月廿八日簽訂之中法關於中越關係之協定。</p>
<p>問：此次談判範圍，及內容爲何？</p>
<p>答：爲實施協定固有許多技術問題，須經雙方協議，主要者爲滇越鐵路之滇段由中國收回，其估價之原則與標準，應與原經營該路之法商公司商量；其次；如海防劃區設關，其碼頭倉庫，棧房等之需要容量，須有一劃定之範圍，並須注意中越貿易之實况以達中越通運之目的。中國將來在海防設立稅關，僅爲通過越南之中國進出口貨物之管理，外傳海防劃爲自由港，實有誤會。</p>
<p>問：此次談判，何以越南政府未參加？</p>
<p>答：此次談判，純係依照中法協定所發之拔術問題，俾與中國以通運之各種便利辦法，並不涉及越南主機領土內政問題，且越方未參加此次談判，是法越內部問題，中國未便作何主張。</p>
<p>問：滇越路之滇段，由中國收回後，該路之經營方式若何？</p>
<p>答：滇段經中國收回後，其主權屬於我國，自應先設法修復壞路段，並與越段辦理聯運上之合作，使雲南出口貿易得以恢復。</p>
<p>問：我國官商物資損失，係由法方以滇段估價償還，如果路價不敷補償我方該項損失時，是否以越北日產爲補償？</p>
<p>答：是。至將來該項官商物資損失之補償如何分配，乃爲我國內部問題，常由各有關機關另行辦理。</p>

<h3 id="c33">僑務政策應該入憲 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>憲法草案訂正稿，已經立法院完成程序，國民大會即將開始討論。我們覺得應該注意研討的問題太多了，今天姑先述其一點。</p>
<p>我們將此次修正案從頭至尾讀了，却找不到「僑務」字樣，但見第三章第二十六條第二四項倒有規定僑民選出的代表，道不過是參加組織國民大會的辦法，至第十章第一〇八條第十三項，有移民及墾殖，規定由中央立法並執行或交由省執行之，這又分明指的是國內移民墾殖，與海外無關。</p>
<p>憲法是國家大法，僑民是祖國人民。憲法草案上對國內人民的權利義務似已應有盡有，而獨對飄流海外孤苦零丁的一千二百萬僑胞却一句話也不提，不無遣憾。深盼此次國民大會制憲時莫忘掉他們，同時海外代表乃至僑務主持人常此良機，也千萬勿輕輕放過。</p>
<p>僑務政策如不能另立專章，至少也應列入憲草中第十三章「基本國策」內。它的條交大概　爲一中華民國之僑務應主議移殖保育事宜，以議僑民之發展。」移殖是人類遷徙的現象。遷徙的狀况普通可分四種，曰侵犯，曰征服，曰殖民、曰移民。「侵犯」是指文化較低而强悍粗獷的民族有組織地掠刧開化較早的區械的有動。峨特人和匈奴人是歷史上著名的例子。這决無沐我中華文化的日本，「封豕長蛇，荐食上國」，就是最近的侵犯行爲。「征服」常指某種文化較高的民族向較洛後的民族用武力進攻，使後者淪爲其附庸，藉以斯加權威，擴張領土，並攫取經濟利益。古羅馬帝國便是這種做汰。</p>
<p>「殖民」是指國家遣送人民至新領土內居留，藉以應展該國的政治勢力，並獲得經濟利益，由移居者的本國取得對移居地的統治權。其進有往往利用商業團體的活動，如東印度公司等，武力是做它的背景，却非赤裸裸地訴諸武力。十七八世紀發生歷史上最大的殖民運動，各國競爭海外勢力，即以殖民行動爲奪取海外領土和利源的武器，先有葡萄牙，西班牙的發動，繼有荷英法的崛起，而後來居上。炎本主議發展的結果，農村人口，流向都市，同時也流向殖民地；商品生產的增加須賴殖民地爲市塲；生產的原料仰賴殖民地供給；獨占資本的高度發展更需要殖民地爲過剩資本的投資地。</p>
<p>「移民」定義，照斐氏（Faichild）所說是一羣個人或家族的遷徙，由他們自動，他們自己負責進行，從一個國家至另一個國家。移民的動機是基於個人的利益，並且是採取和平的手段，以達到其所希異的目的。海外的華僑方式。麥氏（MaeNair）在華僑志一書上說明了，「華僑非殖民」者也。其來也不以羣，故無武力奪取土地之事；其移居也，爲　濟而非爲政治。故但爲消極抵制，而從不積極活動，致其所　痛苦較任何民族爲大。」</p>
<p>吾國移民始自漢面著於唐，稱國人爲「唐人」，呌國人聚居的地方爲「唐人街」，可見當時華僑的盛况。等到明季，西力東侵，中西勢力接觸以後，我無組織而人有野心，列强遂瓜分了南洋。這充分說明了我國僑胞是「移民」而不是殖民，更不是侵犯和征服。他們强凌弱，優奴劣，實　反我們的王道精神。我們三民主義認爲文化較高的民族有扶助文化落後民族的　務，而不主張用武力征服。</p>
<p>移民固不成問題，而我們所提的殖民並無政治領土野心，實際與移民相同，不過移殖二字說來順口而已。日人小島辦爲殖民兩字下定義，他認爲是「某一國的國民永久的或長期的移居於殖民地，經營經濟的或軍事的設施」，而我們的觀念不如此。因爲華僑家鄕觀念重，「樹高千丈，葉落歸根」，即使活時不　，死了也要歸正首邱，決無永久移居之念，同時更無軍事做背景，幾千年來的事實老早可以證明。像我們這樣的移殖政策，並無刺激外國人的地方，初不必懼外而不入憲。</p>
<p>保僑育僑更是天經地義，那一國家的僑民不要　國的保護？那一國家的僑民不要　國的敎育？視僑民爲「莠民一，　僑民自生自滅的時代，應該讓抗戰的火燄化爲灰燼了。保僑在國際法雖無明文規定，然而習慣法和事實需要，早已實施。中國人吃外國人保僑的苦，假使有靈魂的人，大家總不　得這樣快吧!</p>
<p>羅馬帝國時代，純粹用屬人法，簡　之，羅馬市民皆受法律上的保　，而外國人無此權利。中世紀，人民居住，漸形固定，各族又互通婚姻，所以適用屬人法漸感困難，屬地法乃取而代之。法國革命，人權說盛行，即人類有失賦權，無論居住本國或外國，皆不能侵犯，保護僑民的理論於是更爲確立。歐洲各國自法革命後，對僑民的保護不遺餘力，都認爲國家的責任，往往因一二僑民遭遇侵害，不惜犧牲其他人民的生命而爲之聲援。吾國旣有大量的人口在國外，憲法上應該一提保護的責任。</p>
<p>僑民敎育是建僑富僑的基礎，僑民敎育是使僑民不變成外國人而始終愛護祖國的方法，又怎麼可以忽略？人家惡刻的苛例禁止我們華僑敎育人家想了積極方法普設免費學校招收華僑，所爲何事？我們要再敎育日德人民，我們要有國聯敎育科學文化會議，所爲又何事？而我們自己對於國外的黃帝子孫，至今竟似理不理，似管不管，到底是智是　？</p>
<p>華僑對於祖國的貢獻，實在太大了！自贊襄革命以還，抗戰建國，無役不與，獻身轍財，何可數計？若我們在憲法上連僑務政策都不提一個字，如何對得起他們？</p>
<p>推進國際文教合作</p>
<p>聯合國文敎機構近正集會於巴黎，除我國首席代表趙元任博士膺選大會主席外，我國代表陳源敎授又與其它十七國代表當選爲該機構執行委員。此一會議之召開，在謀促進國際文化之合作，實在値得世人的注意。國與國交，以及民族間的彼此交往，雖有各方面的關係，要以文化關係最爲基本。當人類進入原子能的時代，航空以及無棧電的發明，縮短了空間的距離，使整個地球成爲一個極小單位的時候，居住於這地球上的各民族，允應有更密切的文化關係，以增進彼此間的相互了解。所以在這個時候，我們應盡我們的可能來推進國際間的文化關係。聯合國文教機構，在此際召開大會於巴黎，可以說滿足了國際間一個緊迫的需要；此後會議如何展開，各代表出席參加旣以促進國際協調爲職志，相信必有重要的議決；對於促進國際文敎合作上，有很重要的貢獻。</p>
<p>我們覺得遺憾的是：像這樣一種重要的國際集會而竟沒有蘇聯代表的參加，且連旁聽員亦並不派遣，總不免有點美中不足。蘇聯自十月革命以來，則致力於社會主義文化的建設，國家對於學術文化之提倡，不遺餘力；且又創立對外文化協會，謀與蘇聯以外的各民族加緊對於蘇聯的文化關係，我國的名數學家華羅庚敎授，以研究殷商文字出名的考古學家郭沫若氏，以及最近即將訪問蘇聯的名小說家沈雁冰氏（茅盾）據說都是受了蘇聯對外文化協會的邀請而　蘇聯訪問。可蘇聯對於國際文化關係的推進一並不是不關心；而此次聯合國文敎機構的大會竟連旁聽員也不加派遣，終不免令人有點失望。紐約時報前於論到聯合國文敎科學組織首屆大會時，對此曾有所論列，認爲：『蘇聯人士躊躇不前之原因，吾人不難了解；彼等不願其人民投入彼等認爲非正統思想之懷抱中。」我們不欲追　蘇聯拒絕參加的動機；但願蘇聯如果這次會議不派代表出席，下次會議一定有從蘇聯來的代表來替這樣一國際　會生色。</p>
<p>「文化」這個名詞的使用，同時也令人想起不一定是一種具有好感的記憶。從英文上的Cutr　成德上的Kuetuy，是一種令人　惡的記憶。這一樊將文化的意義全變了。德國軍閥的侵略主義與這個字結着深　，在他們的眼裏，德國陸軍負有一種傳佈文化的神聖使命。自中古世以迄希特勒，這種思想深印在每個德國侵略者心裏，我們隣邦的日本不幸也中了這種日耳曼思想的毒。現在希特勒的黨羽是擊潰了，「文化」作爲一種軍閥侵略武器的時代是過去了。然而在今日，普魯士及日本軍閥雖經已被打倒，却依舊看見有多少同樣的情形僞裝在一種動人的外衣下。文化之眞正的價値不在被利用爲一種武器，一種工具，而在其自然的發展。它是超政治而存在並發展着的，如果將它作爲一種工具，不論是否落在像普魯士或日本那樣的軍閥手裏，其結果將是相同的。立陶宛，波蘭，斯洛伐古等地在過去均有燦爛的文化；而現在却在痛苦的深淵。波蘭亡國，却阻止不了偉大的波蘭民族文學的產生，和不朽音樂傑作的創制。凡此，均是我們所得於人類歷史的一點敎訓。</p>
<p>國際文敎合作可以有多方面的活動，然而其最基本的莫若思想的溝通。我們講到關稅壁壘，可是令人最可怕的倒還是思想上的壁壘。政治上的紛爭，　其本原還是一個思想間題。在社會主義的國家，其全部思想均爲一種公式主議所支配，「言一動都逃不出這種思想上公式主義的牢籠；在非社會主義的國家，其思想系統亦自名有（淵源。環顧今日的世界，我們看見有社會主義的文化領域，所謂「西方」文化的領械，伊斯關敎文化的領域，中國文化的領域；彼此之間，雖不無交往，然其間壁壘，依然森嚴如故。如何使彼此間的壁　消除，使整個世界產生一種世界文化，要爲各民族此後努力的鵠的。</p>
<p>就我們中國言，我們在此方面的努力，尤其繁重，。們向以文化古國自號，而我們道分文化遺產的全貌，猶不爲世人所共曉。站在現階段中國人民的立塲，今日我們而言國際文化合作，有輸人與　出的兩面：我們對於其它民族的文化生活必須有充分的了解；對於我們自己民族的文化生活必須使其它民族能够有充分的了解。我們這分賓貴的民族文化遺產，必須使其它民族也有充分了解乃至李受的機會。人類文化的發育，其間原有交互影響的作用；人類文化史上最燦斕的時期，也是這種交互影響最顯著的時候。我們民族歷史上的唐宋乃至明末淸初固不必說，就是在世界其它各處，情形亦復如是。所以在今天，我們一面應該吸收外國文化的精華，一面應將我國固有文化的精華有計劃地和有組織地介紹於國外，以收文化交流之實效。目前蘇聯旣有對外文化協會之組織，英國亦有英國文化委員會的機構，即在美國，在國務院下亦有專司國際文化合作的職掌，可見對於促進國際文化合作，各國如何重視。我們在國際文化合作方面所負使命特別重大，似亦有事　構，以司其事。</p>
<p>海防華僑區邊界　遭法海陸軍砲轟</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿五日電〕法國砲隊與艦隊今日轟擊海防華僑區域邊界，該地有多數房屋被越盟共和國軍隊所佔，但法軍於　毀飛機塲油池後，即行撤退。法國官方稱：越盟軍隊强佔華僑區域冬數房屋，其他越盟軍隊集中於海防南面及東面，法軍曾要求越軍自海防法人及華僑區域撤退，以避免新衝突，此項要求被拒絕，今晨戰事又起，越軍建築新障碍物，其武裝隊伍則開入華僑區，法國軍事前哨站附近均被埋置地雷，法國裝車於巡邏時在障碍物附近受攻擊。法軍爲報復起見，乃向華僑區域邊界砲轟，同時法艦亦開砲，截至發電時止，未知戰事是否停止。</p>

<p>在此大局嚴重的關頭，人民應明辨是非，此乃中國安危所繫見機知微之說，目下的上海社會，潛伏着一個與明辨是非有關的問題，希望政府當局的注意。</p>
<p>今日的上海，巳成爲各地中下流的附逆份子或稱有漢奸嫌疑的人的逋逃之藪，他們或化名，或隱匿，身雖不人囹圄，一樣受到精神上的懲罰，沒有機會爲國家社會服務，遭社會所鄙棄。但是生活的壓迫，並不因人而異，他們因爲不事生產，或許所受較人民更深，而且他們亦有智識份子，對於時局嚴重的感覺，也比人民來得敏銳，這一羣人是意志薄弱而無氣節之流，在這樣動盪的環境中，最容易爲異端邪說所蠱惑，於是最後增加了國家的亂</p>
<p>巨奸大憝，或已伏誅，或已定讞，剩下這批巾下附逆份子，政府應加以賢明的處理，因爲在建國的階段中，人才是可貴的資本，他們雖非人才，總比無才者稍勝一籌，而且他們過去也够不上稱反抗政府，政府一有機會許以自新，恐怕他們來不及的從善如流，以解脫精神上的懲罰吧。</p>
<p>我的建議：政府應於京滬等地大都市中，設立反省院，公開的希望他們自投，用感化的方法，糾正他們的思想，再造他們的國家觀。視他們受毒之深淺，隨時酌定反省期間之長短，將來由政府指定他們的工作，從最下層做起，以成績與效果來抵消他們的前愆，則他們於對自已前途存一新生希望之念，一定肯努力報國，無形中增添了一批中下級人才。</p>

<h3 id="c61">高考在洛陽 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者范鴻</p>
<p>因爲考銓處遷回洛陽的關係，洛陽竟然成了高普考的考區，給洛陽添增不少的地位和色彩，更給上進的或鬱鬱宦途沒有門路的一個光明的希望，這不能不算是洛陽，河南，晋南，陝西的一個喜訊。記者希望這個喜訊能給將來的國家選拔出很多的人才，能給地方人民造點更大的福利？</p>
<p>考試照例是和其他十處同時於十月廿日舉行的。地點在考銓處的所在地距城極遠的周公廟，考試種類，報名手續，考試辦法，考試科目，也完全和他地相同。不過人數不大踴躍，或爲其他地方不能比擬，這當然限於以下的幾種原因：（一）交通不便，道路維艱，報考未能如期趕到，（二）洛陽地方高等機關不多，存留專科以上學校的學生也太少，（三）有志投考者或限於環境不能脫離，或限於經濟不能遠來，所以截止報名日期，遠近報名者第一次高等考試特種考試廿六種類中，僅共一百五十二各，至考試日如期趕赴考塲者一百廿八名，第二次中醫師及司法官考試僅一百十二名，參加考塲者八十六名，兩次體格不合者第一次二人，第二次一人。這已經說明這次的考試，並沒有引起太多人的注意，自然也沒有達到我們預期的希望。</p>
<p>考試雖然人數不多，辦理得却十分嚴格，試卷完全彌封，試題油印，尤其特別愼重，寫蟠版及印製者，均整日夜關在密室，直至試題發後才准出塲，所以他們相常痛苦。考銓處的幾十個職員爲着道百餘人的考試，報名啦，製卷啦，借傢具啦，編號啦，……忙得將近一個月沒有休息，可是他們的待遇並不因工作的繁重而提增，也沒有一般機關裏的趕工費，他們只是爲了國家的選取眞材。</p>
<p>爲了考生的便利，他們供給考生的住處，辦考生膳食，解決考生的食宿困難，伙食早晚二餐，每餐菅飽七百元，考生均可憑准考證買券就食，考生個個稱便。</p>
<p>提到考試經費，一共一百二十萬元，却使考銓處大爲其難。據他們用過的分配數約略如下：試卷費約四十餘萬元，郵費約四十萬元，借傢具搬運費十萬元，監考及考試費約三十萬元，其他約二十萬元，總計一百二十萬元絕對不够兩次考試的應用。然而考試已經順利的舉行完畢了，這不能不佩服國人的服務精神。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約廿五日電〕蘇聯與西方各國之裂縫昨夜似更擴大，一切妥協均歸無效。五大國間之分岐旣因蘇聯反對英美中法限制安理會否決權之使用而增劇，即對世界駐軍調查與裁軍提案，意兌亦不能一致。此外，四國外長對義大利和的，亦無進展，懸而未決之問題，爲數尙有卅五項。昨夜會議進行遲緩，聞夫國務卿貝爾納斯曾慨乎言之日，各外長應決定是否欲擬成和約，依照目前速度，無一和約可於一儿五〇年以前完成。蘇外長莫洛托夫當即答稱，本人並不如此悲觀。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿四日電〕美國各專家今日忙碌整日，試謀調和英蘇關於軍隊調查與裁軍題目之爭執。四十八小時以來，各代表團間雖舉行非正式談話，但其結果非至明日聯大政治安全小組會開會時不能分曉。聞英代表幽倘自倫敦接獲新訓令，即當提出新建議，以答覆蘇外長莫洛托夫之若干指責。英政府之訓令不出三點：第一，以國外駐軍調查與裁軍問題聯緊；第二，以國外駐軍調查與國內駐軍調查相聯緊；第三，樹立一種監督或管理制度。不論出以何項訓令，英代表巴克將答復蘇聯之　難則無疑義。同時，美國方面留出今晚時間作爲技術上的討論，以謀調和此兩題目，草成折衷草案，爲英蘇共同接受。美專家指出此兩題　右數點共通之處，故努力使其密切聯繫。英國對於蘇聯調查國外駐軍之提案所引爲憂懼者，並非因蘇聯代表團未曾正式保證調查之要求，僅爲謀聯合國夾謀會議之便利。接近參謀會議人十承認，　機構工作遲遲不進，即因缺乏關於聯合國各會員國軍隊實力的情報之故。</p>

<p>〔又電〕法國共黨在參議院初選獲勝後，又要求在新政府中取得總理一席。共黨領袖之一龐德語記者稱：共黨在此次選舉中，比人民共和黨多出五十萬票，居各黨之冠，法國人民擁護共黨甚於一切其他政黨，絕無疑義。人民明白表示願意組織民主聯合政府，由國民大會中最大黨之最有資格的代表任首揆。人民共和黨領袖蓋埃對於選舉結果亦表滿意，謂人民共和黨時刻在進步之中。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕聯邦法庭今日　庭，　　國四十萬烟煤礦工領袖魯易斯，旁聽記者爲數之多，當爲　白幼子被綁案以來所未有。魯易斯今日　陳述理由，說明渠雖未遵法院命令撤回終止礦工與政府所訂合同之通知，但亦不應受　處；若魯氏對此不能有　　答覆，推事戈　斯　魯將於星期三或較　之日會同陪審團正式予以審判。今日之開庭乃一長期法律戰之開端，官司可能打至前高法院。華盛頓郵報昨謂：政府擬請法庭判礦工聯會日繳罰金廿萬元，對魯易斯則處以徒刑。六十歲之魯易斯則將援用已有廿年歷史之法律，以證政府無强制禁止怠工之稱。煤礦工潮發生已有五日，政府已向各州州長呼籲　節川煤，民用生產局長史黑爾昨並呼籲人民合作。</p>

<p>— 俞　晶譯自「亞洲與美國」</p>
<p>作者考特里係南非印度消極抵抗委員會駐美代表。現爲使外人瞭解南非之排印運動實况起見，特撰是文，向世界各國呼籲，以博取同情。</p>
<p>我們印度人，像世界上任何民族一樣，有不可放棄的「人權」。自從世界大戰爆發後，我們二百萬印度同胞也曾爲同一目標而奮鬥；成千的印胞在北非及別處爲戰爭而捐軀，但這種犧牲，至少就南非這一個地械來說，是完全白費了。八十六年前，印度人來到南非，是由於邀請而移殖過來的。我就是出生在南非，我的祖先也在三輩之前遷移來的，但我們在名義上算是南非的公民。印度同胞到南非來，都很能刻苦耐勞，他們在煤礦裏，鐵路上作苦工，有的在植種糖甘蔗。他們把汗血來造成目前南非的繁榮。他們爲了南非一帶的富庶纔定居下來，成爲土著。他們也享有國家和地方的投票權。沒有人來阻礙他們的進步，南非人民都認爲他們是良好的公民。但是—近幾年以來我們目擊着南非印度人民的地位，被人攘奪了。每年通過一些新的法律來破壞我們的自由，我們的國家和地方投票選舉權都已經被剝奪了；限制我們經商權利的法律也通過了；火車和汽車上我們須要另外分開坐，公園裏有特製給我們的位子；郵政局設一個我們的櫃臺，在國家政府，地方政府，和法院裏面，我們都只能坐分開的位子。直到現在爲止，已經有六十種法律專司束縛我們的自由運動，阻礙我們經濟和社會的發展。現在更變本加厲，制定了二件給印人打擊極深的法律：一件是亞洲土地期限條列，一件是印度代表一九四六的行政法令。這兩件法律是根本排擠印度人走出南非的社會，而且剝奪了我們的自由所有權及地產權。甘地和尼赫魯大聲疾呼反對這些法律；中國也曾提出抗議。蕭伯納說：「英國的南非聯那是頹廢而勢利的。他們因爲在智慧上趕不及印度人的機敏和點智，於是就用鞭子來迫害印度人民。那些制定的法律簡直與德國迫害猶太人的手段並無二致」！新制定法律不僅是悔辱印度人民而已，已經在傷害印度人民了。二百萬的歐洲移民在國會中佔一五〇席，廿五萬印度人只有權利選舉三個代表，而仍須坐在另外的席上。最近索性制定了法律，取銷了這種少數的代表，連這三個代表都已改成歐洲人了。這就是南非給我們的三等公民權。在九月裏聯合國大會的時候，南非曾對印度的怨言，毫無理由的解釋說：「這全是南非內部的問題，南非政府對於其臣民的政策，並不需要聯合國過問」。希特勒對待猶太人的迫害，不是這般托辭的嗎？在印度方面對於南非虐待他們的子孫深表痛恨，現在已經由最高官吏切斷對南非的貿易，給予以經濟的制裁。我們的祖先雖是印度種族，但我們已經很深地濡染着西方的文明。我們如果有充足的機會，我們就會擔當起國家的責任來。南非是我們的家！南菲是我們誕生的地方，我們曁然是她的土地所培植起來的，我們就要請求同樣有發展她的機會！我們爲對付虐待，卅五年前甘地在南非對付反印法律的老法子就被我們採用了。現在南非的印度人民正在運用消極的抵抗，和政府抗爭。爲了反對新制定的土地法，他們幾百個印度男女繼續不斷地坐在市政府所屬的空地上，這塊空地法律上是不准印人入內的。南非政府每天將這些印度人帶走關起來，現在監獄要大的有四百三十餘人被判做苦工。　南非政府必須對世界輿論的指斥有一個解答。民主不能祗遺漏了南非的印度人呀，民主是全世界人民都應該有的。</p>

<p>據江海關發表：上月份我國對外貿易，進口貨物總值法幣二千零廿七億〇〇六十四萬五千元，出口貨物總便法幣一百七十五億八千七百十七萬二千元，進口貨物總值較九月份總値二千二百廿六億〇六百十七萬元，雖减少一百九十九億〇五百五十二萬五千元，但出口貨物總値較九月份總値五百卅五億二千〇十六萬三千元。其差額則爲三百五十九億三千二百九十九萬一千元。換言之，上月份進口貨與出口貨比値，約爲十二對一，再上月份出口貨値與九月份比較，又爲一對三之比。據悉：上月份進口比九月份稍减之原因，係基於八月十九日政府實施新匯率之效果，至出口不振，除國內物價高漲，生產不旺外，其他如美國船員工潮，影響我國物資不能按照旣定時間裝運，亦爲重大原因之一。至上月份進口，仍以原棉（與九月份同）爲大宗，次爲船隻，再次爲羊毛，更次則爲化學用品及書籍紙張等。出口貨物，以油脂居首位，（與九月份同），猪鬃次之，茶葉再次之，皮革居第四位。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕警察局消防處爲提高人民對火災之警覺性，以求防患未然計，特發動防火運動宣傳週，普遍灌輸市民防火常識。昨日爲宣傳第一日，上午九時半起，舉行消防車輛大遊行，參加單位計有中央，虹口，新閘，靜安，楊樹浦，宜昌路，泰山路，吳興路等九個消防區之各類救火車十七種，計四十輛。由消防處處長周兆祥任總指揮，第二課課長葉斌勇副之。行列自愚園路迪化路口出發，以「防火宣傳週」藍布橫額前導，軍樂隊，巨型油畫，標語等繼之，沿途並以擴音機向市民廣播，路人皆駐足而觀。</p>
<p>昨午三時，市府消防處特假河南路二八〇號該處會議室舉行記者招待會，計到警察局長宣鐵吾，副局長兪叔平，消防處處長周兆祥，總隊長夏國樑，第二課課長葉斌勇，及各報記者等百餘人。當由宣局長主席，並發表三點意見稱：</p>
<p>精神彌補物資缺陷</p>
<p>（一）邇來上海火災所以嚴重之原因，爲戰後人口增加，民廿六年前，上海人口總數不過三百餘萬，現已增至四百餘萬。而南　閘北一帶之住宅多吿毀壞，故居住問題極形擁擠，馬路里弄，比比皆設爈竃，燃燒極爲容易。加以人民對於消防，不加市視、星呈之火，每釀鉅災。回憶前祖界時代，外人處理消防工作，署　設立消防處，極爲重視，經　之支出，恒在百分之五以上，而現時則爲百分之一　。故一年以來、消防處實已担負逾份之責任，輙以「人」之精神，以彌補物質上之缺陷，得使年餘內本市尙無巨災之釀成。</p>
<p>革新設備整飭紀律</p>
<p>（二）現時本椒消防處所用之器具車輛，均接收自偽組織時代，而僞組織則接收自前工部局時期，故多數均已達五十年歷史。若在國外，則早經革新。由於消防工具之過於陳舊，如皮帶上之漏洞等，均足以减低工作上之效率。予以修正與補充，實屬刻不容緩，但在經濟拮据之目前，一時自難如願。</p>
<p>（三）關於消防人員之紀律問題在前租界時代，傳言紛起，弊端百出，諸如：救火必先講價錢等。自本人接手後，雖未敢祖保個個消防人員皆能潔身自好，但至少可保證不敢公然乘人之危，意圖敲詐，否則允許市民據實報吿，本人必予嚴辦。</p>
<p>公開展覽消防設備</p>
<p>最後，宣局長謂消防處有兩種工作——「消」與「防」。「消」是火災釀成後積極的去消滅它。「防」是在火災未發生時先作有效之防備。</p>
<p>宣局長詞畢，乃由課長葉斌勇，區隊長徐立人等率領，赴三樓參觀，該處有各種最新式之消防設備公開展覽，並陳列最合理想之戲院倉庫建築模型。五時許，並放映「火災的化學作用」影片，該片係亞細亞火油公司攝製，內分「火從何處來？」：「如何防火」等數片段，長的二十分鐘，招待會迄六時許始散。</p>
<p>昨晚七時，吳市長並在警察廣播電台講述防火之意義及常識。於本週間，各電影院於上映前，均先行放映防火的幻燈片，各街道一律張貼防火標語，預定之各項節目，均將按决分別進行。</p>

<p>〔木報特寫〕中央信託局地產處，最近爲了解決公敎人員的居住問題，曾擬了一個「建築公敎人員居作房屋墊款辦法」，而且已經四聯總處批准。房荒聲中，這不啻是公敎人員們的一個福音！</p>
<p>據中信局地產處的負責人吿訴記者：這種墊款造屋辦法，擬先在京滬兩地試辦，總額是二百億元。現在正在推動組織墊款銀團，設法　款。同時池行籌備建築材料，和造屋所需的基地。</p>
<p>照這個計劃的草案看起來，各式房屋共分甲，乙，丙，丁，戊五種。價格也分一千萬，二千萬，三千萬，三千五百萬，及四千萬元（速基地價在內）等五種。二百億的墊款總額，預計可造各式大小的房屋的近千幢。據說各項計劃安排就緒後，明年二月間，就可動工，佔計四月個內，可全部竣工。</p>
<p>動工前，中信局將在京滬兩地登報公開預約承遺。承購預約人，以在政府機關及學校，文化，敎育等團體服務的公敎人員爲限。預約時，先付房屋造價（連基地價在內）百分之三十。其餘百分之七十，按月息二分半計息，自房屋造竣交住之日起，分十二個月平均攤還。舉一個例子：拿戊種一千萬元的房屋說（連基地價在內），預約時先付造價三成，就是三百萬元，其餘七百萬元，按月計息ｆｇ　分半，自交屋日起，分十二個月平均攤還，每月不過機到六十萬元左右，一年期滿，造屋價銀拔淸後，中信局會把土塊所有權狀交給你，你就是自己的地主和房東，豈非一勞永逸！</p>
<p>理想地點四處</p>
<p>也許讀者急於要曉得這些房子坐落的地段，開間，式樣和設備種種。記者所以從草案中摘取了一個梗概，分別報道如後：</p>
<p>上海方面浩屋的基地，現在正由中信局向敵僞產業處理局給購中，該批敵僞地產總而積共的三百畝，分散十處，計開：</p>
<p>江灣路六三花園　一四·五二三畝</p>
<p>北四卅路（近江灣路）　九·二一九畝</p>
<p>山陰路四達路　二九·〇四八畝</p>
<p>周家嘴路　二三·一九六畝</p>
<p>海格路丁香花園　一四·五二三畝</p>
<p>新閘路一四二三號　六·三七三畝</p>
<p>東體育會路六四八號　三二·六七四畝</p>
<p>歡陽路四九〇號　五·三二八畝</p>
<p>蒲石路海格路口　六·一九二畝</p>
<p>虹橋路一〇〇號　一四〇·〇〇〇畝</p>
<p>以上十處基地，以地段合式，和交通便利言，中信局認爲以首列的四處，嬝屬理想。這批公敎人員的房屋，將億先在這四塊基地上蓋起來·中信局購這批敵僞地產的公事，已經送陳敵僞產　建理局一俟敵產局接到行政院批示，就可照辦</p>
<p>五種不同式樣</p>
<p>五種房子的開間，各有大小，建築材料，也有差別，間數也有多少。茲分述如次：</p>
<p>甲種又分AB兩種，建築材料却都一樣，水泥粉刷外牆，永泥平頂屋而，洋松地板，柳安夾板內門和鋼窗。</p>
<p>甲A種是單開間三層洋房住宅式，基地面積一三七〇平方呎。底層有起居室，廚房，僕役間各一·二層有大臥室，小臥室，浴室各一。三層也有大小臥室各一，和平合一方。這種房屋的浩價述基地，估計四千萬元。</p>
<p>甲B種是雙開間三層公寓式，基地面積三千平方呎。底層有起居室，餐室，書室，備菜間，廚房各一·二層和三層各有臥室二間，起居徨，廚房，浴室各一·這種房屋造價連基地，估計一萬一千萬元。價格比較高昂，不過每層可自成單位，分層出售。</p>
<p>乙丙兩種的建築材料，是粉毛水泥外牆，紅瓦屋面，杉木地板，次板內門，洋松窗戶。</p>
<p>乙種是一間半兩層住宅式，基地面積一〇五〇平方呎。底層有餐室附帶起居室一火間，廚房，僕役室各一間。二層有大小臥室共三間，浴室一間。這種房屋造價連基地，估計三千五百萬元。</p>
<p>丙種是單開間兩層住宅式，基地面積七八二平方呎。底層有起居室，廚房，僕役室各一。二層有大小臥室二間，浴室一間。這種房屋造價連基地，估計三千萬元。</p>
<p>丁戊兩種的建築材料，是石灰粉刷外牆，紅瓦屋面，永泥及杉木地板，杉木門窗。</p>
<p>丁種是單開間兩層住宅式，基地而積七百平方呎。底層有起居室，廚房各一。二層有臥室，浴室，及小間各一。這種房屋造價連基地，佔計二千萬元。</p>
<p>戊種是單開間假兩層住宅式，基地面積三八四平方呎。底層有起居室，廚房，厠室各一。二層有臥室一大間。這種房屋造價連基地，估計一千萬元。</p>
<p>利潤卻等於零</p>
<p>記者看到這批房屋的建築成本表，利潤一攔，都劃成零字。這表示中信局承造道批房屋時，根木沒把利潤打進去，而純粹是以服務公敎人員爲「的。這些造屋價銀的估計，還是一個月前編造好的。現在時過境遷，道估計說不定會有些變動。但中信局地產處負責人，對這批房屋的興建，是具有充份把握的。他說：要是一般銀錢業對這筆二百億的造屋墊款，感到利息太薄，而無興參加銀團時，中信局決定單獨墊款舉辦，所以資金可望不發生問題。至於建築材料，中仃局有接收敵產的磚瓦窰，可以大量生產磚瓦。他如木材，鋼鐵，洋灰，水泥，衛生器具等等，中信局也有充份的供應。所以建築材料，無虞匱乏。現在就等待着洽購這批敵僞地產，洽購就緒後，就可開始計劃興建新屋了。</p>
<p>公敎人員們，耐心地等着新屋住吧！</p>

<p>被吿楊錫志，男，年三十七歲，重慶人，住林森中路六二二弄二六號，業糧食部上海糧政特派員。李崇年，男，年四十一歲，淮陰人，住古拔路五十號，業糧食部田賦署長　長江區糧食儲運委員會主任委員。</p>
<p>右開被吿因貪汚嫌疑一案，（三五年度偵申第二四四三號）經本檢察官偵查終結，認爲應不起訴。茲叙述理由如後：</p>

<p>被吿楊錫志，於本年二月間因上海前市長錢大鈞在市府召集各機關首長會議時，咸以各糧商經敵偽摧殘，數年以來組織旣不健全，資金亦復有限，滬市人口稠密，糧食消耗全賴各地運濟，經會議一致主張，建議政府舉辦糧貸，以裕民食，該被吿遂將各機關首長之意見，轉呈糧食部，惟查政府是吾同意舉辦，及舉辦方法如何，皆非該被吿所能取決，且行政院宋院長於三月初蒞滬時，面諭其出國赴美，另有任務，被吿即於三月七日飛渝，向糧食部報吿，三月十日返滬，三月十四日上午九時搭乘美軍用機飛美，時糧貸辦法政府尙未核定，外界謂其舉辦糧貸之決定，及各種運用，均爲該被吿出國前所預籌與事實不符，此外又無其他證據足以證明其有犯罪情形，殊難論以貪汚罪責。</p>
<p>李崇年</p>
<p>查被吿李崇年，當糧貸辦法實施時，曾隨糧食部長徐堪到滬協助修改貸款辦法條文，並介紹江北通益兩公司參與承貸，固經被吿供認不諱，然糧貸事務，非其主管，隨同長官視察，奉命參與修訂條文，亦屬常事，殊難謂有存心便於他人作奸情事，至其向萬墨林所介紹之通益江北兩公司雖經貸予糧款，然據被吿弁解，認爲僅知該兩公司組織强資本大，辦事好，故在談話時向萬墨林提出作爲參考，核與事實，尙屬相符，且該通益江北兩公司旣無犯罪情事，則該被吿之介紹，即難指爲有勾串謀利，被吿旣乏犯罪證據，自難構成任何罪責。</p>
<p>綜上所述，被吿楊錫志李崇年，於上海糧貸案中犯罪嫌疑不足，合依刑事訴訟法第二百三十一條第十款處分不起訴。上海地方法院檢察官吳啓華。中華民國三十五年十一月二十三日。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近立法院通過新稅法，規定筵席捐採分等課稅，並定以起征點。娛榮捐規定最高不得超過百分之二十五。此外如房捐及使用牌照稅等之征收，亦予普遍之减低。市政當局以該項決定，關係本市收入極爲重大，已電行政院，請予從長考慮。（曾誌昨報）。現據財局負責人談，各項改變之新稅法，尤以使用牌照稅與本市現行辦法差團特大，一旦實行，則本市稅攻，更將不堪設想。故財政局長谷春帆，特於日昨晋京，親問中央有關當局解　並請求重加考慮，至於本市今後之稅收應如何辦理，須俟谷局長回滬後，始可決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺似乎向來多事，道大的和它整厚的寺產頗有關係吧！這兩天又鬧了一齣接收的好戲，現在還沒有收塲。事情是醞釀了好久，近一點設起吧，就在二十三日晚上，六根佾柬邀本市各報記者於福州路京華酒家，席間報吿稱：他要回任靜安寺住持，整肅寺規，淸理寺產。</p>
<p>第二天的報上，就有了「靜安寺護法施主擁護僧六根回寺復職公啓」，「上海佛敎剃度派寺院公啓」，「靜安寺鄰近商家公啓」，公啓的內容，都是請六根和尙回寺復職。</p>
<p>就在這一天下午一點鐘左右，有十幾位護法施主陪了六根和尙到靜安寺回任，但遭到了靜安寺僧衆和佛敎會上海市分會代表的拒絕。鬧到四點多鐘，六根等人又都回去了。</p>
<p>據白聖及育枚兩位和尙吿記者稱：六根想來接收寺產，實在沒有理由。他們異口同聲的說，六根回任靜安寺住持，是完全不合法的，而巨他也沒有資格擔任靜安寺的住持。</p>
<p>但是，六根和尙是否就肯這樣罷休呢？靜安寺的爭奪戰，是否能够這樣容易的結束呢，答案恐怕是一個「不」字。其實出家人那裏還存什麼名利心呢，這眞也是一種現世的諷刺。</p>

<p>該處並設有實業投資部，設計實施工業上之各種投資·中美實業公司總公司設本市，分公司設各大埠，長沙漢口兩地之分公司現已成立，重慶廣州桂林在籌備中。用人採經濟原則，力求支出之節省，故總公司人員現在不過廿餘人，分公司僅十人左右。現公司正向政府辦理立案手續，業務已在積極準備，一切採「做而後說」「穩打穩紮」之方式。俟業務正式開展時，再公開與社會見面。</p>
<p>中美實業公司目標以進口之利潤，補貼出口之虧蝕，進口商品中，注重大小五金西藥農工機器，出口品着重桐油猪鬃等。目前已推動之業務，爲由該公司之介紹，使成都市政府與美國兩大公司訂立契的，由後者供給資本技術，建設成都之自來水，電燈，電話，公共汽車，下水道，醫院病床設備，六大工程。工程經費總額在法幣一百億元以上。美方所供給之物資及服務，作爲借款而不作爲投資，由四川省政府在五至十年內還淸，利息的爲四至六厘。原則上已得雙方同意，此舉成功，公司方面擬再介紹美國之物力與技術，重建我國在戰時破壞最烈之城市，如長沙衡陽桂林柳州等。</p>
<p>中美實業公司對於目前之房荒問題，亦擬有所貢獻。但其努力之範圍，不願限於沿海之都市，擬普及內地及鄉村。現正與美國某公司接洽，將活動房屋製造廠一家搬來我國，利用本國木材，就地製造，如此可省去運輸上之不經濟。此製造廠之機器，每日可出產一萬五千呎之木板，以供建築之用。該公司已派專人硏究其性能，不久可望成交。</p>
<p>該公司之長期計劃，完全着重於工業及水利之建設。在工業部門，希望能在漢口建立一大規模之紗廠，並在華中區成立一大煉油廠，精煉桐油，使其便於出口，在水利部門，則雄心更大，目下已在接洽訂購五百至一千個抽水機，然後選擇適當地區成立農村服務處，代農民灌溉。估計每一灌溉機能灌田一千畝之多，一千部機器能灌田一百萬畝，於民生必有裨益。該公司主持人並一再强調：願以民營事業之地位，介紹友邦之資本技術，協助政府進行建設工作。</p>

<p>黑白女子籃球隊，昨晚在滬初次使用男子規則出戰，果然雪白不經一擊，黑白以三十五比十分大勝，上半時十九此三分。黑白在全賽中，暢所欲爲，雪白奔跑體力投擲俱見不如，祗能屈服於黑白之下。女子隊獲勝，男子組則受挫於巨人，三十四比三十七，相差僅三分上半時各得十二分平手，上半時甚見接近，下半時巨人分數激增，黑白奮勇追趕，惜乎功虧一簣，黑白表演，似已見進步。</p>
<p>黑白女將暢所欲爲</p>
<p>首塲女組黑白女再逢雪白，乃客軍在滬首次採用男子規則，由陳寳琳任裁判”黑白以黃如蘭，陳玉潤，蕭番冷，歐陽美蘭，吳玉物出塲，雪白以張秀麗，王慧琳，任寬萍，朱家珍，黃如玉應戰。黑白陳玉潤首開紀錄，黃如蘭妙中，玉物一托，連得六分，雪白對男子規則，極不習慣，一籌莫展，直至九比〇時，始由張秀麗投入一球，第一節終，十五此二。再戰聲起，雪白僅由黃如玉罰入一分，上半時終了，十九對三，黑白佔先。休息之後，黑白又大調人馬，陳玉潤梅開二度，盧淑惠一投破籃，雪白王慧琳遠射得點，黑白以廿六對七遙領於第三節，最後一節，仍爲黑白天下，雪白張秀麗扳回二分，法定時間完畢，黑白以卅五對十，再克雪白。</p>
<p>黑白男子功虧一簣</p>
<p>繼之黑白男登場，與茂人交兵，番軍得美將皮谷奈助陣，黑白亦奮發有爲，减少無謂調人，故前半戰來，頗爲精彩。裁判瞿鴻律，吳效堤，黑白以林子儀，葉克熙，許因珍，施榮螺，莊玉豐五人出戰，巨人則先以沙司金昆仲，耶龍，皮谷奈，强杜萊上塲，A沙司金首開紀錄，葉克熙罰球獲一分，相持甚久，第一節巨人以五對三小勝。二節開始，林子　一射，扳成平手，黑白以傅隊長永信替代莊玉　，皮谷奈單臂破籃，永信還以顏色，耶龍擲入後，黑白沈仁壽入代林子儀，黑白窮追，形勢殊緊，前半告終，各十二平手。</p>
<p>休息再戰，陶勃林基罰球得點，許因珍一投，黑白以十四比十三抬頭，繼復成各十六平手，此時黑白又頻頻調人，巨人乘虛而入，皮谷奈一氣連中五球，三節完了，黑白十九，巨人廿七。末了一節，皮谷奈又建殊勳，相差十分，黑白乃亟起直追，葉克熙林子儀傅永信等連取八分，故比數又見接近，最後曾成卅三對卅五之局面，僅少一球，觀衆大呼加油，奈浮尼克籃下托中，爲巨人奠定勝局，迨葉克熙罰入，時間已屆，黑白乃以卅四對卅七受挫於巨人。</p>

<h3 id="c168">西安市況在動蕩中漲價限價黑價無價 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 十七日航訊　本報駐西安記者李馳</p>
<p>記者今夏七月爲木報寫過一篇通訊，說長安物價平賤，所以戰爭雖結束一年，而人口反而有增無减。當時西安市物價之低，在全國四十幾個省會及都市中，使列入第四·五等，想不到事不出三四個月，在最近四十天內，以米·麥·麵三者爲首的漲風，有如狂飆中一股烈火般前火着千分之九百九十九的市民日常生活，目前的食糧問題分明不在歉收或存糧薄，而在乎操縱下售價，無理暴騰與配給技術尚待改善。西安糧價刻下已達到「金字塔」之巓，比諸本省境內他縣甚至有高出三·四倍者。據從東邊隴海鐵路西來的旅客說，西安物價甚至是沿綫最高峯。過了這「最高頂點」再往西就一路斜坡而下。西安與寳鷄之間近來亦有「單帮客」出現了，一個人雖販運三幾斗的也有利可圖，在這段鐵路上可算件空前的事。西安市民不得已求諸黑市的三萬多元一袋麵和七萬多一祖米，分明已逍越京滬地區的價格了。市民們對於「限政」當局措施，毀譽不一，然而大家都好像想問一問：這千分之一的「某種人物」操縱糧價，旣然並非無法可取締，那末，他們的「特殊利潤」將要繼續到何時？</p>
<p>季節波動</p>
<p>筆者打開了民國廿六年起西安物價各種紀錄，首先擱下因通貨膨脹而物價漸揚這種總的趨向，再除去因戰爭（失利和勝利），政治。等人爲的突然的因素，與乎水災旱災等非人爲因素，就很快的看到每年農曆歲幕必有一度季節的波動，這或許各地都有的現象，而其理由亦極明顯，但値得注意的却是這種季節波動始自每年那一個月份，照戰前平年而論，大抵在舊曆年年關前一個月開始。然西安近四五年則有愈來愈早的傾向，其始尚在每年新曆十二月，慢慢的挪前到十一月。十月，今年更提早到九月間就升起物價的「紅燈籠」來了。今回的漲風恐怕要過了明年一月，才有平息下來喘一口氣的機會。</p>
<p>物價騰揚</p>
<p>游資與囤積，先天的結下不解之緣·然而今秋西安的「頭寸」，托京滬地帶更高拆息之「福」（？），大量資金早已流往長江口三角地帶，此間一週前拆息居然達到一角四分，實屬近來少見的高利率。另據政府公布，七月份以降的通貨增加額亦比過去來得少。由此可知，今回物價之騰揚，不能把通貨額與游資作爲首要的因子　說起來有點令人難以置信，西安這次以糧價暴騰來領導這股漲風，却是有人拿「三三五」新外匯率的餘波，和九月初上海謠傳匯率再度調整來「借題發揮」，大做文章！我們很難理解，種在三秦黃土層的麥子和穀子，與紐約華爾街的金圓之間，竟有如此密切的聯繫！</p>
<p>粉廠生產</p>
<p>今年米麥雖然說不上很豐收，但總好於平年。而且糧賦已比去年减·說到市內磨粉工廠的出產率，據專家劉友琛氏統計：全市目前每月最低限度可磨三十萬袋。（另據警局較高的估計則每月可磨六十萬袋。）這數字足供全市每月消費量廿五萬袋而有餘。（因半數市民吃米和土麵也·）雖說從八月起粉廠藉口無煤或毫無藉口而像瘧疾的時停時磨，談不到全力增產，但看十月初市面開始鬧麵荒的當兒，每天黃昏未明，就有無數車好麵粉拉出城下鄉『逃匿」誰說是眞正的「匱乏」？抑或已盡了人事的補救？</p>
<p>糧價在四十天內漲了百分之百是事實！九月底麵（每袋）賣一　萬六千元到十一月第二次評價說二萬而實際黑市超出三萬，米（每斗合十五市斤）同期中由六千四　至黑市一萬三，麥子（每斗（由三千躍至五千五·其時平價麵也有些「裝飾市容」，二十個官定的供應站每天二百張購買體就供給二百五十萬吃麵的市民的「民食」了！這樣，我們還有理由怪黑市之跋扈跳梁麽？排長班，站一天或三五天，軋人堆，演全武行，到頭來還是空手空腹而回。在這樣情景之下，儘管某報說：一供應站已無人問津」，而同日另一家「×××報」却記述站上搶購者「宛若飢餓者搶食然！」</p>
<p>的確是「搶」，而且另外一種「搶」則在入城近郊，由特殊的「有力者」來「搶購」任何進城的食糧，木炭也如此，五十天前賣兩萬元一担的賣到六萬元了！「搶」的若是他們生活必需品，或許情有可原，而這種分明屬於「特殊權益」，「法豈可恕」？</p>
<p>怕管愛管</p>
<p>當局對於物價狂漲，當然有所處置。省府在九月間奉令開始施行限價，十月成立物俱評議會，然而這許議會成立當天的首决　決，却是面謁省府主席請求取消限價！（有人挖苦的說，難道禁烟協會也敢主張鴉片公賣的麽？（祝主席對此當然不能接納，相反的加强限政，而且受限價的還有花紗，肉類，工資等等。在這時期，市民眼看着限政收效而額手稱慶。猖在一時的花紗價壓下來了，並且成爲限價中圾成功的一項，中小型布廠從此可以按價配到花紗。牛肉羊肉雖然一度停宰，終而停不了幾天又自動復業了。照相業漲了一倍價，但生意銳减反而「拍一送一」，令人「啼笑皆非」。……</p>
<p>可惜的到十一月初旬，奮限價終被漲價壓倒了；而目前的新限價却被「黑市」「黑價」和「無貨無價」威脅着。財廳和田糧處打算撥售賦糧，不過技術上尚待解決。</p>
<p>五十萬市民生活所托的新限價能繼續下去而戰勝「黑價」，平抑「漲價」麽？這是給施政者當前的一試鍊。「不怕官，祗怕管」這種看法是錯的。官若能實施以人民利益爲前提的限政，必受人民擁護，人民愛受他們來「管」，不過從「怕管」而到「愛管」，尚有一條悠長而彎曲的路，也就是施政作風從「舊」到「新」的分水嶺。</p>
<h3 id="c169">印京七日 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 本報駐印記者周祥光十三日德里航訊</p>
<p>德里Delhi爲印度帝國之故都，在印歷史上，亦是一個極可紀念之地，牠曾被印度各王朝，作爲京都，最古時候，據印度史彼詩大戰書Maha-Bharata所載，當年宙迪斯王Yudbister曾都於此，時當公元前四千餘年也。迄回族征印，莫臥兒Mughal　Empire帝國各王朝，無不都此，繼而英人侵入印度，一度設都於加爾各答，迄一九一一年，英皇喬治第五宣佈將印京加爾各答遷移新德里New　Delhi離德里祇二哩之差。今日新德里不但爲政治重錢，亦爲交通工中心，凡東印，西北，孟買，中央諸鐵路幹綫，無不匯集於此，英印間航空綫，亦自英倫抵達此間，至於工業方面，若棉織，鋼鐵等，亦極繁盛，所以，來印人士·除遨遊所謂三大管區，加爾各答Calcutta孟買Bombey及馬特拉斯Madres外，印京亦爲必遊之地。</p>
<p>紅堡印象</p>
<p>記者在今夏，自遊海特拉巴藩邦後，即搭車到此，一觀印京風一物，我初時原住在一間旁遮普的一回敎旅社，嗣覺膳食方面，頗不一合味，被因該社設備不佳，乃於一同日間，遷往帝國旅社，日付租金印幣三盾，膳食在外，以目前印京生活程度言之，可算便宜。我到印京的第二日，早上去訪印友，穆克濟先生，相談半小時，並承渠遣其姪古沙爾君陪我至中國專員公署，其時，原任專員已調職返國，署務由一等秘書代理；該署隨員賴良良君，畢業於中央政校，少年英俊，服務於此，我們相談，備覺歡洽。新德里爲英人在印新建之都市，到處林木成蔭，街市建設，具有現代圖案方式，往往由一圓形草地，分出若干條市街，初來之人，若訪友走路，有迷失路途之苦。</p>
<p>下午三時，我遊觀德里紅堡ReoFort此堡原由莫臥兒王朝之沙迦汗Sha　janhan（在位時間自一六二七年—一六五八年）所建，堡中王宮，用白色大理石砌城，雕有精細花紋，充份表現着莫臥兒派建築的藝術，其中沙迦汗的議廳Diwan-I-has允覺巍峨富麗，憶當年沙皇常坐在一孔雀寳座於此廳中，開庭審判案件，或召羣臣，訓誡一切，該孔雀寳座，後在一七九三年，被侵入印度的波斯王那迪爾沙Nadir　Shah所據去，但宮廳却完好如初，每當夕陽西下，其大理石製天棚上的金飾，及方柱上所嵌的寳石，相映成輝，誠大觀也。墻上刻有波斯文的對句云：『天下若有極樂國，，除卻此地無處尋」。</p>
<p>斯時，有一美國新聞記者，到此遊歷，與余相遇，備覺親熱，彼更爲我拍攝一影，以留紀念。堡中有博物館，回敎禮拜堂等，旁駐有英國軍隊，去秋印度之民族軍，即飽斯S．C．Bose在日德保護下，於新加坡所組設印度臨時政府之軍隊，迄盟國抗戰勝利，臨時政府瓦解，此批民族高級軍官，由英軍俘至印度，處以不忠英王，背判大不列顚帝國之罪，係在此紅堡中，開庭審問，當日尼赫魯先生，還穿上律師衣服，出庭辯護，結果，民族軍之三領袖，皆被審判官判以極刑，但判決書送到英駐印度軍隊總司令奧欽勒克將軍手中時，立批大赦，無罪釋放，故奧氏此點，頗爲印人所佩。紅堡計長三千二百英尺，廣的一千八百英尺，高的一百英尺左右，外邊全用紅石砌成，位於河旁，遊人須購參觀券，每張二安，惟因駐軍關係，故紅堡開放時間，每日限於下午三時至五時，並不全日開放也。</p>
<p>迦麥回廟</p>
<p>遊紅堡畢，乃往觀迦麥回廟，Jams　Masjid廟離紅堡半哩許，亦用紅石砌成，廟之面積長二百呎，廣一百二十呎，中間圓頂，高約一百三十呎，廟有三個大門，分建東南北三方，東門較大，遊人都自此入，此一回廟，亦爲沙迦汗王所建，當日回王駐節德里時，每逢星期五早晨，必循例到廟禱拜也。我匆匆遊畢，即赴專署應賴君良良晚宴，其時，中政校留印公費生盧君浩然，及甫自伊朗來印之武建功君均在，萬里相逢，把晤至歡，晚九時興盡而散。</p>
<p>第三日晨，我驅車赴印度斯坦時報The　Hindustan　Times晤柯令邦迪先生Mr．Krinpandhi他是該報社論主筆，該報爲印度工業家弟琪比拉先生所創，由甘地先生之子任總編輯，實際上小甘地常不在此，主其事者，柯君也。我到報社時，適値柯君養病家中，旋由報社職員，派人陪我前往，我們相見時，有一種說不出的高興，可惜他的健康未恢復，不能作長談也。下午赴拉克須彌奈能廟拜訪，此廟建於西曆一九三八年，費款印幣三百多萬盾，由錢克比拉先生K．K．Birla出資建立，供東印度神祗拉克須彌及克立須那等旁另建有佛廟一所，供佛陀像，現由錫蘭摩訶菩提會派人管理。查印度有兩位大工業家，　爲達達先生，今日印度臨時政府的供應部長馬太與工鎖部長巴浦，他們二人原都是達達公司經理之一；一爲比拉先生，他是國民大會黨的後台經濟老　，比拉有四兄弟，關於工業組織方面者，係其第三弟D．G．Birla所爲，比拉大哥J．K．Birla則爲一宗敎信仰者，專門行善，佈施爲事，中國僧尼在印者，比拉皆按時予以濟助，或施以錢，或惠以物，我到該廟時，曾晤到比拉大哥，此時，他正在廟中，監工鑿石，彼看見我，至感高興，可惜他祗知印文，不懂英文，故我們談話時，還請他的私人秘書沈先生從旁譯述，他要我去見他的第三個弟弟，他說，一九四二年間，蔣介石將軍訪印時，曾住在他的加爾各答寓所，蔣將軍並請其弟弟前往中國遊訪，等語，同時，他堅囑我住在他的廟裏，我當即答復因明日須前赴中印度，不能在此久留，俟回來時，定當小住此間，靜聽梵鐘，涵養數日也。彼日諾，乃告辭。嗣至岡那市塲Canaught　Place觀訪，此地爲印政府規定之市塲，如加城之新街市然。所有各類商店，集中於此，蓋新德里其他各街道，均係住家所在，無商舖也。</p>
<p>古篤高塔</p>
<p>印京之另一古蹟，則爲古篤高一塔Kutab　Miner爲印度偉大建築物之一，離德里西南的十一哩許，據傳在公元前，此塔即已建成，嗣至第八世紀，由阿難巴爾氏Anangpal重修，到第十二世紀，又經周漢拉迦浦族人重建，當時修築此一古蹟，並無何種目的在也。惟據史家考證，則此古篤高塔，實由印度敎統治印度時代的一個最後皇帝羅琪PrithviRaj爲其愛妻每日欲在高處，眺望宙那河Junna而築者也。在公元第十二世紀，由古篤烏定王Kutab-ud-Din重修，當時，高塔建築祇有一層。迄公元一二一〇一一二三六年間，始經阿爾德麻沙Shams-Ud-Din　Altamash建成五層樓之塔，復於一三五一年一一三五八年間，塔之第四層與第五層，經杜格拉王Firoz　Shah　Tughlak再建，才有今日之狀。塔高二百三十八呎，塔基直徑的四十七呎，塔頂計四呎直徑，第一層高九十四呎十一吋，第二層計五十呎八吋半，第三層四十呎三吋半，第四層廿五呎四吋，第五層則有二十二呎四吋。各層均用紅石砌成，並嵌以大理石，石上圖案，至爲精細美麗。各層刻有經文，如第一曆所刻詩句：</p>
<p>「若人能造塔舉獻於天帝也，則天帝亦必依樣於天庭造屋，以賜萬民」。</p>
<p>參觀畢，遂偕印友柯爾沙Kholsha訪蘇楊先生Soloo並承彼招待晚餐，其女沙恭達羆病初愈，亦出來在旁侍候相談片刻，備見溫順。晚返寓休息。</p>
<p>德里大學　第四日內擬訪德里大學，我先到印度敎學院晤白德拉敎授，嗣偕同不德里大學遊覽，白教授昔就學於加爾各答大學沙倫坡學院Serampore　College與我有先後同學之誼，故彼此相見，有恨晚之感。德里大學學舍，原係總督官邸，頗爲精緻，我承白敎授介紹，乃與該校文科敎務主任柯來曦Dr．Qureshi相見，彼此相談，亦極相得，他問起我中國的大學情形，我都一一回答，中印兩國大學制度所不同者，蓋印度採英國制，我則模仿美國，所以，在印度現行敎育制度中，小學十年，學院四年，及研究院二年，吾國則中小學一共十二年，而大學四年，故中國大學畢業學生，等於印度研究院之畢業學生，不過課程方面，略有不同耳。德里大學校長照例由印度總督魏非爾兼任，現任副校長則聘前英帝國最高法院院長伊洛担任，實際負校務之責者，則由文，法，理科三主任耳。德里大學在印度各大學中，要算最優之一個，且經英，法，美各國大學承認，故程度相當高，該校現除有五個學院，內有婦女學院，商學院，及法學院，其餘兩個學院，則文理科也。中午並訪德里英文部主任杜德博士，他今年已五十來歲，，曾任大學羅摩迦斯學院院長，彼在大學硏究院任敎浪漫主義文學，但他對於佛學相當研究，曾著有印度第五世紀時代之佛敎一書，銷行於英美出版界，他同我談起關於玄奘與中國佛學問題，他知道玄奘曾譯述佛經百多種，但不知其內容如何，蓋印度自回敎入侵後，若干梵文經典原本，均已遺失故也。他對於中國，備感興趣，他曾在德里大學講述「中國與印度」一題，引起極大多數人大大興趣。他祗想來中國觀光，更願考察中國佛敎狀况。我同他相談，足足談了數小時，因晚間我應阿及梅爾敎育局秘書長Mr．Varm維爾曼之邀，須搭八時火車，故我匆匆辭出返寓，準備一切。</p>
<p>在界坡士邦Jajpur　State及阿及梅爾專員區，Ajmer　Commissioner　Province住了三天，記者復匆匆返回德里，，乃應比拉大哥盛意，住於他的廟中，他供給膳宿外，還每逢晨晚更囑侍者送來牛奶咖啡，招待備至。我因參觀中央立法會議事，曾先後訪晤印友楊迦敎授，英人在印之三大建築，除中央立法會議大　外，還有總督官邸Vlcegal　Lodge佔地三百三十英畝，其中花園佔地十二英畝，官邸有三百四十房間，曾費款百萬盾，裝置電話設備，官邸成於一九二九年，首决居此屋者，則爲愛爾文公爵Lord　Irwin每當夜間電光照耀，有如白晝，益見輝煌。次爲秘書　，即是印度中央政府辦公地方，位在官邸旁，一切建築，猶比美國白宮爲麗，奠基於公元一九一一年，完成於一九三〇年。內有辦公室一千間左右，各處都繪有印度古代壁畫，殊屬富麗堂皇，我在晚間，晤比拉大哥，幷的定於次日下午往晤其三弟D．G．Birla看看當代印度之大工業。</p>
<p>訪晤比拉</p>
<p>到了次日下午四時，比拉大哥特地差徠他的秘書沈先生陪余往見三弟比拉，他們四個兄弟都住在一起，其家靠近總督官邸不遠，兩座洋房，前面房屋則爲比拉先生辦事人員所住之處，第二座則爲其家人所居；我到他家裏時，先由比拉大哥介紹其三兄弟相見，旋弟琪比拉引我到他私人會客室中相談，他今年五十來歲，戴着一副灰色玳瑁眼鏡，態度雍容，大有政治家風度，會客室中放着一張寫字台，及四張沙發外，壁上掛着西洋及印度古畫，頗覺雅緻。我們開始談話時。除了寒暄一番外，我就直截了當的問他：「你有否願意去中國一行」？他很明快的回答着「當一九四二年蔣主席到印度時，他曾囑我到中國一遊，觀察各種工業近况，不過目前瑣事太忙，不能動身，縱使要去，亦在下年了」。我於是再同他說：「若時間許可的話，你能早日到中國考察工業，自屬甚佳，况重工業方面，却很落後，還望你多多相助」。這時，他答復我的話中，音調頗形沉重，「。我們目己祖國的印度，還沒有完全自由獨立，那裏有餘力去帮助你們呵」！愛國之情，溢於言表；他對於我所辦的加城中華學校，亦頗關心。我同他相談，一直談了半小時以上，後來，他特別地派一輛汽車，送我回萬。我住在比拉廟中，頗覺舒適，日夕聞梵鐘佛音爲之淸快。</p>
<p>新德里爲新建都市，人口不多，地面曠大，富有現代建築，人覺此間，甚覺淸爽。老德里城中，仍如往昔之狀，市街狹小，喧鬧已極，却與新京相反，老德里爲印度八朝之京城，新德里則是今後現代印度之政治經濟中心。</p>

<p>— 十六日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>幾乎全世界的人士都知這我們中國工業已到了最危險的時機，我們國內工業界人士的呼籲，呌喊，使是一絲微弱的聲浪，激不起怎樣大的傳昔，因此，着實有奄奄一息，困憊待斃的神氣。</p>
<p>一般工廠普遍的病象，厥爲外貨傾銷，成本過高，資金不足銷路呆滯·記者曾走訪好幾個廠家，都有如此感覺。日用品的廠家當然不能與外貨匹敵，即是一些中國原先特有的產品，也不能與之抗衡·我們曾去嘉興參觀一個民豐紙廠和一個中蠶公司的絹絲廠，就可瞭見今日山國工業的面貌·</p>
<p>民豐紙廠，規模相當偉大，在全國的紙廠中也可在數一數二之列。這廠已有二十年的歷史，所有一切工房，宿舍，辦公廳等都是以鋼骨水泥建建築的現代房屋，在整個紙廠內，還有一個作爲職工遊息的憇園，佈置成一座西式花園，精致美麗。</p>
<p>現在廠內有八百多工人，有泥水，木，銅匠，理髮，等工人，舉凡社會上一切生活上必需的，這裏應有盡有，形同一個小小的社會，可說是極其完備的一個工廠。廠中目前的產品，爲捲烟紙與馬糞紙兩種，它們都經過蔴和稻草的原料，切成細小的片斷，然後經過搗爛，經過足足可以睡得下一百多人的滾漿球，再把漿流上十幾丈長大的造紙機，成爲一頁頁的紙張。他們可以造其他各種紙張，如白報紙之類，可惜因爲成本過高無人問津。現在這潔白細嫩的捲烟紙也是在困苦中掙扎着它的出路了。在勝利不久時，渝，昆，滬，京，漢，各地，都到嘉興的民豐紙廠來採辦捲烟紙，他們包了飛機各自運回自己所需要的數世。但是自從美國貨捲烟紙來了後，這國產的捲烟紙日就衰落，並不是美國貨比中國　好，據一位專家言，民豐紙廠的捲烟紙要比美國貨强一些，但因爲價格高於美國貨，一般人在不習慣用中國貨和捲烟廠也想减低成本的觀念下，當然因着利誘而採用美國的捲烟紙了。</p>
<p>普通一箱捲烟紙，有三十盤，一盤可以做一箱捲烟，則一箱紙可以做三十箱捲烟，以嘉興這樣的物價，生活指數形成的成本加利潤計算，要一百萬元一箱，但是美國貨從成功紙後又由遙遠的美洲，涉重洋而至中國，透過了海關的手續到達需要的各地，僅需八十萬元一箱。所以嘉興民豐紙廠的盛景，只是曇花一現，目下已在走向下坡路了。比較還能維持原有銷路的要算馬糞紙，美國不願將面積大份量重的馬糞紙運到中國來，所以香烟的匣子紙，多半還是採用中國貨的，但是誰能保證以後不再遝來呢？在關稅政策失效下，馬糞紙一樣可以運進來的。</p>
<p>據廠方負責人談：「現在這種不景氣的慘象，本來早可停工了，效是因爲顧算到這八百多工人也有將近四千多人的生活，所以才勉强的維持着的。」</p>
<p>他又說：「幸虧我們是民營工廠，如果戰後讓政府來接收，恐怕現在根本不能復工了。「這句話眞可謂一針見血，這樣大的一個工廠，照政府的接收程序上講起來，自然要慢得多了。我們去參觀時正値星期日，他們却每一間廠房都有人輪値辦公的人，雖然機器沒有動，而輪値守護機器的，還有人在。所以可以知道一個梗槪。</p>
<p>我們又上中國蠶絲公司的絹絲廠，他本來的面目爲緯成絲廠，我們去時，僅有幾個職員在辦公室裏，我們要求見負責人，他們說負責人出去了，我們要求參觀，他們說鑰匙人家帶着走了，我們問概况，他們也瞠目不知所對。我們僅見那一幢幢雄偉的建築，而其內容一些也不知道。據嚮導我們去參觀的人說：「他們氣派要比民豐紙廠大得多了。動不動都掮出宋院長道塊大牌子來。」是的，我們才了然官營與民營的不同，才了然民豐紙廠負責人告訴我們這一句話：「幸虧我們是民營工廠，如果戰後讓政府來接收，恐怕現在根本不能復工了。」</p>
<p>基於以上所述，雖然僅是兩個工廠的介紹，但可以看出其中的大槪”我們可以知道工廠普遍的病象果爲外貨傾銷，成本過高，資金不足，銷路呆需。但有一種現象，即爲官營與民營之關鍵所在，今天官營的有人維持，有人撑腰，但在做官而不做工廠。民營的雖然盡心竭力想維持，但缺乏了官的力量的支持，仍舊只有衰退下來。</p>
<p>要維護今天中國這一點點脆弱不堪的工業，第一就要剷除工廠衙門化，第二就要採行保護關稅政策。如果我們的工廠衙門化了，一切祗知道辦公事，養辦公事的人，而不知道生產，不知道養技術人才，那麼，生產沒辦法，只能流爲次殖民地的經濟現狀。如果我們不以關稅來保護，則外貨如此傾銷中國，中國的一切工業盡將摧毀殆盡，中國眞的變成了商塲，沒有工業，將淪爲次殖民地的經濟地位。</p>
<p>我們的國家，缺乏生動活潑的熱力！我們國家的工廠，實在也需要生動活潑的熟力啊沒有熱，沒有力，機器是動不起來的。機器動不起來，工業休想繁榮滋長。</p>

<p>— 鄭孝威</p>
<p>現在你已進入一個新底環境，有一個自己主持底家庭，你將要永遠伴着它前進，興盛或是我亡。新家庭底命運是根據你底措施而決定的，在道裏我願供獻幾點値得注意的事：</p>
<p>（一）要使丈夫覺得你不僅是一位溫柔賢良的主婦，同時仍舊是他底愛人。許多人結了婚便忽略了這一點，時常因此而演成家庭的不幸。你應當保持婚前容貌的修飾，和以前一樣地熱情，關心他底一切。尤其在丈夫辦公完畢回家的時候，不要把日常瑣事麻煩他，使他在疲乏的心神上再蒙上一層陰霾，這樣在無形巾他會感到家庭才是他底歸宿地。</p>
<p>（二）家庭底預算和設計。在物價高昻的今天，家庭一切日用開銷，都要靠你丈夫一點微薄的收入來支持·如果用度沒有預算，很快地經濟來源便感到枯竭。這樣便會引起夫妻間的爭吵·妻子怨丈夫無能，丈夫說妻子浪費。你應當先有個預算照比例支出，即或你自己想添置些什麼，也不要獨斷獨行，最好能暗示丈夫，兩人同意一道去買，這樣就是將來錢不够用，他也不便單獨怨你了。</p>
<p>在現在都市裏，很不容易找到合理的居處，但也必須維持整齊和淸潔。一切傢俱的佈置，都要設法使牠實用，美觀，儘可能地維持美的條件，至少也要使人有一種淸新的感覺。</p>
<p>（三）孩子來的時候。結婚總免不了有孩子，他們是愛的象徵和結晶。沒有一位做父母的不愛他底孩子。人生底目的便是先充實自己再求現社會的進步，然後便交給後一代——孩子們。使他們繼續自己的願望永遠棉續下去。因此今日的孩子便是他年國家的主人翁。你得好好地敎育他，使他們有一顆向上的心和一個健全的體格。</p>
<p>最後，我得提醒你在看顧孩子的時候，不要忘記了丈夫。這樣有時也會引起家庭糾紛的。</p>
<h3 id="c172">怎樣養育嬰孩？供獻給做母親的人 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 韞鈺</p>
<p>筆者在沒有寫正文以前，須要告訴全國已做母親的人們，孩子入世，他沒有罪惡，誰殺害了他，就是誰有了罪，一般家庭經濟富裕而不懂育兒的方法，以致常常半途夭折的，正同貧困人家無法撫育而溺嬰一樣的不人道，所以筆者願在這衷告訴你怎樣養育你的孩子。</p>
<p>年靑的主婦們，中國人得天獨厚，厚在那裏？告訴您吧，厚在嬰兒入世都有人奶吃，（沒有的是少數）人奶，尤其是親娘的奶，是嬰兒自己帶來的食糧。嬰兒吃下去不須消化，直接入血，簡直比輸血的功力還捷，不但營養力至爲無上，還給嬰兒身體上以無限的抵抗力，抵抗一切疾病。但若母親無奶而雇奶媽，這也是一個合於衛生的良法，因爲人奶究竟高於一切，但是切勿雇用有遺傳病的奶媽，這是做母親的應注意的。在嬰孩得不到母親的時候，主婦們常常用牛奶或羊奶代替，這幾乎是各民族所共有的見解，可是牛奶中的蛋白質和脂肪，都是嬰兒不易消化的，所以非稀薄不可，但稀薄營養就差了，反能作潟。此地可以告訴你一個好方法，就是加入米湯，可以得到牛奶的營養而不腹瀉。因爲米湯旣能維持天然乳的膠性狀，又能補助腸內良性兩叉菌的發育，所以牛奶加米湯反能使嬰兒肥壯。</p>
<p>新鮮綠棄蔬菜，是每個乳嬰必須的副食料。嬰兒到二三個月大，就該用綠葉湯喂他。再大點就可每日吃菜泥，還有水菓泥，橘子汁，西瓜湯，都是好的。我們知道奶油的確是一樣好東西，就是西康同胞吃的酥油，可是舶來品太不經濟；還有魚肝油也是洋貨。我們的嬰兒須要補充脂肪及維他命甲等，能有自產的酪油喫最好，否則用蛋亦佳，嬰兒的胃不能消化蛋白，但能消化蛋黃，一天給乳嬰三個蛋，蛋白給母親吃，蛋黃給孩子吃，一舉而二得，犯不着把錢送給美麗的包裝。</p>
<p>還有就是肝了，道東西中間維他命，可以說色色俱全，還有許多未經發現的要素，別看輕了他，事實上肝可治乳嬰營養不足，體重減輕，貧血，皮膚乾燥，腹瀉不止種種惡症，新鮮的肝應當多給兒童吃。</p>
<p>其决我們要知道的，就是要使嬰孩多到室外享曠野的空氣。雖然在上海這繁華的都市中，淸曠的地方極少，那末也可以到附近的公園中去，多呼吸新鮮空氣。人的皮膚是一個富於感應的器管，皮膚受日光燥氣的鼓盪，能引起有力的反應，那便是紅血球的增加，新陳代謝的旺盛，體力活潑，精神愉快，顯而易起的就是胃口大開，食慾增進，因此體重增加。兒童常在外面，可以鍜鍊皮膚，增進肺的耐寒耐風，以減少傷風等。都市兒竄較鄉村兒童容易感受傷風，就這個原因</p>
<p>兒童的體格是從小訓練起來的。中國有句古語。「要得小兒安，常帶三分飢與寒。」這三分飢與寒，便合有鍜鍊的意思。嬰兒飲乳須有定量，一哭便吃，及任意多吃，總非好事。至於衣服，要乾燥寬鬆，不包紮過緊，並須常常洗澡，多在室外生活，則長大來必定强健。</p>
<p>嬰兒的尿布，要用能吸水能煮能消毒不傷兒童皮膚爲宜，尿布應當屬於兒童衣服的一部分，須勤換，用白色製成，以便檢查嬰兒的大便。</p>
<p>此外，嬰兒的哭並不是要人抱。往往嬰兒一哭，大人即去抱他，這樣反而使嬰兒知道哭就是要人抱的方法。只要按時哺乳，按時洗浴，按時換尿布，按時飲開水，嬰兒自然不會哭了。實騐人生敎育，從嬰兒就開始了。</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們，嬰兒的睡眠是最重要的，但睡眠要有定時，初坐的嬰兒當然是例外，大槪到七八個月的嬰兒，必須規定時間，令其睡覺，在夜間必須要得到全夜的睡覺，方才算好，夜間不可授乳，孩子一定要養成全夜睡眠的現象。較大的兒童，中餐後必定强迫睡午睡，切不可跟隨着大人們昏天黑地的深夜不睡。還有乳兒的飲食，要有一定的規定，請讀者閱十月廿九日本欄乳兒飲食單一文。</p>
<p>孩子有病的時候，做母親的一定要速請醫醫治，如遇朋友親戚家有生，病的小孩，最好自己的小孩不要去走動，因爲小孩的感染性很大。還有百日咳，不但能致成肺病，還可能將孩子致死。所以小孩的病是不可忽略的。</p>
<p>總之，一個年靑的主婦，若能依照上述的方佚去看育你的孩子，這樣可以保證您的孩子，一定會强健體壯的。</p>

<p>— 靜淑</p>
<p>昨天下午在朋友家裏吃到了一種很精美的點心，當時我就問她這種點心是在那裏買的？怎麼這樣的香甜可口。她笑着告訴我說：「這不是買的，是我家中自己做的葡萄奇鬆糕。」她知道我喜食這種蛋糕，便把它的製法告訴了我，現在我把它寫在下面，讀者們假使高興的話，不妨也做一些試試看。</p>
<p>（原料）：麵粉半磅，牛乳油一杯，藕粉一杯，鷄蛋四枚，白糖四兩，葡萄乾一小碗，燥米麵半調羹。</p>
<p>（製法）：用一淺缸，將牛乳油與白糖傾入拌和，再加麵粉，藕粉，燥米麵一同攪勻，欖好後將缸內之物倒入篩器，在篩器下面，用一大盆盛之，篩動的時候，粉屑漸次落入盆內，大塊粉糰存在篩器上者，以手搓碎後再篩，節下的粉要愈細愈好。再將鷄蛋一一打破，與葡萄一齊傾入盆內。用手揉之，的二十分鐘。如天氣發燥，麵粉易乾，可略加些水。盆內混和之物調勻後，便取起放在平板上，捺成一大圓餅，放在蒸籠內入鍋蒸之。的一點一刻鐘，待熟取起，再置於塗油烘糕織板上，用微溫鑪火烘之烘至半點鐘後糕之全部蒸氣已乾，如貼近鐵板處之麵粉，已變淡黃色，即可取起，俟其冷透，用刀切成小方塊，以碟盛之，食之味甚香甜，美不勝言，用以請客，極爲雅緻。</p>

<p>— 紹</p>
<p>如果你將羊毛衫羊毛褲用顯微鏡來仔細看上一看，你就可以發現它一塊塊積壘起來的交曆的組織，好像魚鱗片一般無二。所以，主婦們！你們假使洗羊毛衫褲。不得法和一時大意的話，那末羊毛衫褲上的魚鱗就要脫落，而且又會縮縐硬化，形狀歪斜；即使是一件新的羊毛衫，從此旣不適用，又不雅觀，也祇好算了，這里，我來告訴你洗滌羊毛衫褲有效的方法：</p>
<p>在洗滌新的羊毛衫褲的時候是最困難的，因爲初次沒水的羊毛衫，水里大部份的肥皂溶液，都被羊毛吸收，如果快快的洗，那末羊毛衫所吸收的肥皂溶液一時不容易洗凈。所以你最好在漂凈以前，先將羊毛衫浸二三小時，或者在水里再加一些阿摩尼亞，那末效力更大，（每加侖水放阿摩尼亞兩匙）因爲阿摩尼亞是含有揮發性的，不過浸的時間也只要二十分鐘左右就够了。因爲浸得太長久，羊毛又庶起縮縐了。在洗時着手要輕，越少摩擦越好，因爲摩擦得多，「魚鱗」就要脫落了。同時也不可用肥皂應擦，最好用皂片或先將肥皂切碎溶化在水里，所用的水不可太冷，也不可太熱，前後溫度尤需一樣。羊毛衫褲洗好後，曬時，須要掛得整齊，四面拉挺，不然羊毛衫曬乾後，形狀歪斜，不容易矯正，穿起來旣不舒服，又不美觀了。</p>
<p>這一種方法，不獨是適用於羊毛衫褲，只要是毛織品及絨錢的衣着，都應該這樣洗滌。你不要看了上面這方法怕厭煩，打算拿到洗衣作去，我勸你不妨先試試我上面說的方法，因爲上洗衣作去洗羊毛衫褲，那還是自己媽媽虎虎的算了吧。</p>

<p>— 咸</p>
<p>我們吃了東西之後，有時感到特別容易餓，有時又覺得鯁塞在胃中，這實在是食物消化的時間問題。下面是一張食物消化時間表，管家的主婦亦可以作爲做菜的參考：</p>
<p>米——一小時（消化時間下同，）</p>
<p>燒猪肉——一小時半</p>
<p>洋米，蘋果，海帶，葡萄——一時三刻</p>
<p>炙牛肝，生雞蛋，蠶豆，大，麥，菠菜——二小時</p>
<p>牛乳，橘子——二時零五分生牛乳，燒鷄蛋—二時一刻</p>
<p>雞蛋糕，洋蔥，黃瓜，西瓜，枇杷——二時半</p>
<p>煮雞肉，南瓜，蔥，甜瓜，——二時三刻</p>
<p>半熟雞蛋，珍珠米，香菌——三小時</p>
<p>炙牛肉，醃豬肉，煮羅葡——三時一刻</p>
<p>香腸，玉蜀黍麫包——三時廿分</p>
<p>牛油，炙雞肉，　，蛤蜊，山薯——三時卅分</p>
<p>煮牛肉——三時五十分</p>
<p>炙猪肉，生煎牛肉——四時二十分</p>
<p>從以上各項食物看起來最易消化，生煎的和火炙的都不易消化，不易常食。</p>

<p>一，洗面　（一）熱水洗面，（二）用上等牙粉擦面，（三）以熱毛巾拭去積粉。（四）乘面部濕潤時，將雪花膏先從面頰下部敷起，逆行而上敷鼻樑，以及眼部等的凹處。再輕輕撲粉。（五）然後以絲巾輕拭多餘的粉痕，面容便能顯得均勻，細膩光潔了。但是香粉在可能避免下，還是不用爲妙，否則也不宜多敷。因爲它的原料總不出鉛粉，滑石粉的混合物，一旦多敷了，便能阻塞面部汗脂腺的排泄工作，使體內的廢料和炭氣集結在面部諸汗腺口，日久便會漸漸蘊結而成黑點。所謂雀斑的成因，其一部分的成因是由於汗脂腺排泄不流鴨所致的。</p>
<p>二，面色　（一）用薄燒酒或紹酒，混以去皮的蘋菓，共同放在瓶內，相隔二三天，再放些蕎麥進去，再過三四天，然後以潔淨的紗布或脫脂棉花蘸這種混合溶液，每天在面上搽擦幾决，日久而色自能紅潤。（二）熱水潤面之後，塗以蘋菓露，待其乾燥，再用礬石浸水，輕擦面部。日久亦能紅潤，（三）水芹內含有多量營養料，多食水芹，日久亦能使面部轉色。（四）日用蘋菓酸擦面，也可收效。</p>
<p>三，皮膚，（一）用冷水洗去面部，頸項，四肢等的塵垢，以刺激皮膚，然後用乾毛巾摩擦之，到覺得紅熱爲止。如此天天摩擦而不輟，就能使肌膚嬌柔且不生皺紋。（三）冷水洗刷之後，即搽以植物性化粧水，日漸也可使肌膚不致粗糙，而保持天麗。（三）如欲肌膚由粗糙而變成白嫩，每天早晨可用嫩荳腐和以蘋菓皮，加以糜擦，月餘便能使肌膚嬌嫩。（四）欲除面部皺紋的，可以用牛奶和以蜂蜜而搽擦之，日漸即可使皮膚由鬆弛而緊縮。（六）要除面部斑痕者，可用茄子，切成碎末，用以摩擦面部，日久便可消除。</p>
<p>四，頭髮　（一）頭髮不一定要電燙。電燙並不能增加美觀·（二）式樣毋須複雜，因爲很費時間，而且還須不時整理。（三）頭髮但求順光澤不求式樣。新奇如頭髮不十分柔順，你必須勤於洗梳。</p>
<p>五，嘴唇　塗嘴唇膏是有礙衛生的。它將阻礙局部血液的流通，更將隔離和空中養氣的接觸，日久了，股紅的嘴唇逐漸會變成淡灰色了。有三個簡而且便利的方法：（一）用新鮮的靑橄欖，咬破了每日去擦唇幾次，久之自能使嘴唇紅潤鮮豔。（二）用玫瑰水與冷開水調和，再加入亞摩民亞水十餘滴，拌勻。每日塗於唇上，的一句後，便能使嘴唇殷紅可愛·（三）冬天的嘴唇因乾燥而很易破裂或起皺紋，可用牛乳加硼酸少許，過一天，塗在唇上，即可以防止裂唇的痛苦了。</p>
<p>至於其他染指甲等，恕不在這裏多說。總之，我們要天然美，要健康美。我們最好能摒棄一切人工的化妝術，因爲化妝的美是不足以長久的呀！</p>

<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>抗戰時期，在內地的智識份子吃盡了苦，而精神食糧的缺乏勝似現實食糧的缺乏。民以食爲天，政府發給公敎人員的「實物米」，誠然陳而黃，發過熱，有時甚至霉了；可是，米總是米，不管好壞，其作用能塞飽肚皮。精神食糧便不同了：米糙，米陳，揑着鼻孔，直着　子，還嚥得下去；惡劣的著作，趣味太低的文章，或繪畫，或曲子，「硬是」（四川土語）不敢領敎！何况我們這批敎外國文學的人，積年與國外著作界絕了緣，不單對於新的著作成了亮眼的瞎子，就是舊事重提，要想「溫故」，也不可能，因爲誰帶了參老書逃難啊！於是我們由單調而感覺沉悶，由沉悶而掉入痛苦的深淵。</p>
<p>復員歸來，除了少數有辦法的人做官發財而外，其餘的弄筆榫朋友大都，「窮」而「忙」，愈窮愈忙，接着便是愈忙愈窮。添置書籍幾乎成爲不可能；——但是，如果僥天之倖，淪陷區家中的醫沒有失掉，或者沒有完全失掉，那麽，可以全部「溫故」，至少也能「溫」一部份，以待夢想中的「知新」！</p>
<p>中央大學圖書館裏有相當數目的法文書：文，哲，社，語言，科學，都有；可惜爲數始終不多，新書完全沒有，舊書也沒有系統。比較有計劃，有選擇的，還是老友凌夢痕博士的一套，共五千册。可是，他是社會學博士，所以他的藏書中硏究社會科學的書最精，其它的——例如文學書——退而爲「陪襯」；再則這套書是他死後，由他的夫人捐出來紀念他的，更無從選擇，也不應當有所選擇。這種情形的養成，我應當負全責：因爲我在中央大學敎了十五年的法國文學和法文，關於購置法文書籍，我理應貢獻意見。譬如各位教英美文學和英文的敎授們，人數最多，集思廣益，各開或合開書單，購置英美書籍最爲完備。又如德文書，在商章孫敎授督導之下，雖則爲數不多。却頗有條理。惟有我　曾盡我的責任！爲何呢？因爲：（一）我自己有相常數目的藏書，尤其關於當代小說，搜羅頗富；（二）那時我南克上海兩頭跑，上海有個藏書十數萬册的法文協會圖書館，我是該會會員，可去借書。可是，一到重慶，我就自食其果了！倘使當時駐紥在重慶領事巷內的法國大使館不予我以方便，我決計寫不出篇輻相常長，後來收入「法國文學的主要思潮」（商務印書館）中的：「四十年來的法國文學」，「納粹鐵蹄下的法國文學」，「巴黎解放前的法國文學」三篇含有報導性的論文。</p>
<p>我是如何眷念遺留在土海家中的中法文書啊！而眷念之情，更因我放在南京中央大學的法文書——內中包括我歷年在巴黎，或里昂，或比京，或瑞士，所發表的文章——被炸，而深切化了！這次復員歸來，我急乎要整理這些書：不但爲了九年未見，却也因爲在淪陷時代，家中替我燒去了不少「取厭」於敵僞的書。整理的工作進行很慢：不是因爲書太多，却因爲我一面整理，一面瀏覽。復次，每當我寫作倦了，我就去整理。然而這項工作並未能給我以休息：我工作「過」子夜不算什麽一回事，甚至某次我到淸農三時半纔睡覺！</p>
<p>哦！故紙，忠實的朋友！在這個混亂的時代，世態炎凉變成天經地義；惟有你們，不因我得意——我曾經得意過麽？——而趨奉我，也不因我失意而瞧不起我！哦！故紙，你們也是我的明鏡：你們很坦白把我以前寫的文章展陳於我面前，使我得以和我現在的作品比較；進步麽？退步麼？抑是故步自封呢？哦！故紙，你們更是淸濁的分水嶺：多少人，他們的文章留在此地，他們在抗戰時忠貞不二的行爲證明了他們言行的一致；也有些人，——幸而是少數，——雖則當年信誓旦旦，說得天花亂墜，到頭來，狐狸尾巴顯原身，經不起大時代的鍛鍊，跌入了漢奸的糞坑！</p>
<p>哦！故紙，我將如何感激你們？你們解除了「時間」的束縛；不，你們賜給我上遡「以往」的神通，逼我不忠的「記憶」俯首就範。賴藉了你們，哦！故紙，我想起了不少的事情；尤其我查着了第一次「文藝茶話會」舉行的日期，——那是民國廿一年六月十九日，星期日，——使我轉瞬間减輕了十四年翅你們也使我憶及很多滑稽的事情。我旣然提起「文藝茶話會」，就談談它的滑稽黨故：孫春苔和章衣萍都是很熱心的老茶友，當初我們的月刋「文藝茶話」由他們兩位發行。不料出到第五期（廿一年十二月），兩人發生齟齬：雜誌改由春苔一人經理；衣萍創刊「文藝春秋」（廿二年七月），以示抵抗。又不知道爲了什麽緣故，直延至廿二年四月廿三日，「文藝茶話」在「時事新報」上登了一個緊要啓事；九月一日，在第一卷第三期「文藝春秋」裏頁，也載了一個「章衣萍啓事」：各人陳述各人的理由。今日觀之，事情小得小無可小，而當年必然吵得面紅耳赤：正眞有趣！</p>
<p>但是，故紙，我也要埋怨你們幾聲，因爲你們爲我帶來了銀灰色的惆悵。我在你們中間找到了我當彻出洋留學時的照相：廿六年的光陰使我變成了半老頭子！在倖存的各故信中，我發現法國諾雅綺伯爵夫人（Mme　la　comtesse　de　Noailles）和阿根廷島　波伯爵夫人（Mtme　la　comtesse　Victoria　Q＇Campo）寫給我的信：這個發現使我想起一九三〇年五月初旬，泰谷雨（Sir　Rabindranath　Tagore）在巴黎開書展。預展那天攝影：泰谷爾皓髪銀髯，立在正中；諾雅綺夫人混身桃紅，烏剛波夫人混身杏絲，分立左右：三個國家，三位天才詩人！泰谷爾還向我問起徐志摩咧！現今確知當年三人中巳經死去兩位，我和烏剛波夫人也斷絕音訊十多年了！唉！（三五，十一，廿一，晚。）</p>

<h3 id="c180">散曲家黃大痴 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 振元</p>
<p>散曲在元代，通行於各階層，上至達官貴人，下至敎坊色長，妓女之流，都善於作曲，鍾嗣成錄鬼簿所載散曲作家，有學士，參政，元帥，巾丞，憲使及知州府判等；太平樂府靑樓集，輟耕錄所收有不少妓女之作，如大都王氏，順时秀等人；至於一般戲曲作家兼作散曲的更是難以枚舉。足徵元散曲流傳之廣和作者之多，只有宋人小詞，明代俗曲可以和它先後媲美。它們所以能盛極一時的緣故，曲詞平易，人人能解，固然是一個原因；但主要的還是由於曲調的簡易，人人會唱，人人會作，一經撰就，隨時可以被之管弦，傳播於世。這情形和現在歌譜略有相似之處。當時的樂曲和文詞旣是合一的，所以雖下至倡優之流也可作曲。至於文人，更不問可知。元代戲曲作者大抵是浮沉下僚的文士和書會先生之流，但散曲作者却有不少文人。這原因是由於；戲曲是代言體，其中有科，白，曲三項，又要注意結構，非專業者不易作得好；散曲可以敍事更便於抒情，無科白，結構等顧慮，小令又十分簡單，雖非專業者也可從事。這樣就造成散曲的黃金時代，一般文人頗多致力於此。畫家黃公望便是這班非專業的曲家之一，他在當時似作不少的散曲，所以鍾嗣成把他作爲曲家，記於錄鬼簿中。他的生平，畫籍中有不少記載，至於作曲則僅見於鍾氏的記述。錄鬼簿的作者和大痴關係並不深，故置於「已死才人不相知者」之列。錄鬼簿記火痴云：</p>
<p>「公望字子久，乃陸神堂之次弟也，係姑蘇琴川子游巷居，鬆齡時螟蛉溫州黃氏爲嗣，因而姓焉。其父年九句時方立嗣，見子久乃云「黃公望子久矣」。先充浙西憲令，以事論經理田糧，獲直。後在京爲權　所中。改號一峯。原居淞江，以下術閒居自命，棄人間事，易姓名爲苦行凈聲，又號大痴翁。公望之學問，不待文飾；至於天下之士，無所不知，下至薄技小藝，無所不能，長詞短曲，落筆即成，人皆師尊之，允能作畫」。</p>
<p>上面所錄是工國維校通行本錄鬼簿，明四明范氏天一閣鈔本錄鬼簿（此書原本近爲鄭振鐸先生所得）和通行本頗多差異，如開首作：「名公望，松江人」，無「陸神堂」至「子久矣」一段，「憲令」作「憲史」等等（就黃公望傳論，通行本較鈔本通順），但事跡却無不全。</p>
<p>元人散曲總集流傳於現在的有楊朝英輯太平樂府，陽春白雪，無名氏樂府新聲，樂府羣珠，樂府羣玉，自然集等書，但其中並無大痴的散曲，明人曲選中也沒有收錄，似他的散曲久已散佚了。</p>
<p>不料無意中，却在曲選以外覓到一首小令，那是收在「涵芬樓秘笈」第三集「孫氏書畫鈔」中的。「書畫鈔」是明代裝潢者孫鳳就其所見輯錄而成。題作「李嵩髑髏紈扇」，曲云：</p>
<p>〔沒半點皮和肉，有一石苦和愁，傀儡兒這將絲綫抽，弄一個小樣子把寃家逗，識破箇羞那不羞？呆兀自五里已單堠」。末題：「至正甲午春三月十日大痴道人作弟子休休王玄眞書右寄醉中天」。</p>
<p>這支小令置之元散曲中雖非上乘，但却是大痴的「碩果僅存」之作了。元代畫家兼作散曲者，除黃氏外，還有倪雲林，明賈仲名績錄鬼簿嘗賞其水仙子，歷代詩餘錄他的小令五支，其餘作品也不多見。兩家散曲文獻中旣不可多得，書書題跋中或有倖存，倘能輯錄，亦元散曲輯佚的別開生面的工作。</p>

<p>到杭州</p>
<p>减克家引詩經之比而說的怎樣運用形容詞去美化句子，我想起時常有把「電掣風馳」來比一種東西的速度的｛同時這四字的實質形容也很切合。譬如我們乘電車，不是眞正的「電掣」嗎？在火車上，我聯想到這四字了，可是，火車不是電車，不能說電掣，該是「火掣」，「汽掣」。</p>
<p>火掣千輪，或跨着橫越田野的巨獸，望得見杭州城的山色了。這中國第一占有湖山名勝的都會，數分鐘後又可以重瞻它的丰儀。十年闊別，它是在空前的浩刧裏艱困奮鬥着而雄壯了起來。</p>
<p>「看！我們的飛機！」大家熱情地歡呼着，是筧橋飛機塲，我們新生的飛將軍在不斷練習。</p>
<p>接着，大家亂哄哄的重復提起安放的行李，我還呆坐着，因爲我和杭州一個朋友姓陳的的好，過他那兒結伴回鄉去。他是民政廳的視察，現在正忙着辦理縣長考試，而是我的幼年朋友。呆坐的原因，就爲我的面前像已浮現出他那堅毅的面龐。</p>
<p>這時車窗外掠進寒風，下起雨來了。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見聽了她這句突擊方式的問話，心下一震，表面却依然很鎭定的，替她把那杯「勝利飲」端正了一下，借着這一個閒閒的小動作，輕輕把脳想裏翻騰鼎沸一般的思潮，暫時壓了一壓，不讓牠流露到外表上來。那些思潮，統計一下，大概是一串不大合邏輯的點滴：「奇怪，我在邢裏見過她？」「這到底是怎麼一回事？搗的什麽鬼？」「瞧那如怨如訴的樣子，這傢伙表情不錯……不，簡直是表情的聖手。」「不，哪裏及得耀羣那們天眞？」「她是在白天說鬼話咧……敢拿這話來試探老爺！」……「奇怪她爲什麽有這種怨對的表情？」「莫非我出國以前在那裏見過面？」「或是很年幼時的玩伴……米子？……菊子？……靑子？……要不就是芳子？」「不能！她們不能脫胎換骨，十來年長得這麽美！決不可能，而且眉目間完全沒有一點舊的印象·」「那麽，哪裏見過？……倒底是不是初次見面？……</p>
<p>「不……」鶴見壓下了起伏着的思潮，「不能算初次見面吧！」也用一個「吧」的疑問。</p>
<p>她笑了，笑得那麼嬌饑，那麽頑皮，笑裏好像含有諷刺的意味。</p>
<p>「失禮得很，鶴見君，！」因爲　覺得笑得越了界限，「可是，我們在哪　見過的呢？」</p>
<p>這一問，未免有些露骨的惡作劇了，逼得鶴見似乎沒有退步的餘地了。</p>
<p>「對於小姐方面，我不敢隨意說，在我一方面，至少這是第二次！」</p>
<p>「那麽，第一次是在……」她頑皮得過頭了。</p>
<p>「就是小姐一進門的那一　……我已經是傾誠的仰慕過了！」鶴見把「油」上加了一個「滑」，來對付她過分的惡作劇。見她玫瑰的雙頰上，立時浮起了兩朶紅　，便感覺自己也有些滑過了分，然而嘴角仍舊毫不保留的溜出了「不但如此，而且……」下面的話，有點近乎輕薄，覺得得沒有勇氣，一口說出。</p>
<p>「而且？……」妙要求聽他的下文，雖說有些報然含羞，同時還有些怨他只顧逞一時口齒痛快，不管人家的窘迫。</p>
<p>「而且在魂夢裏，常常有着小姐這樣美麗的情影，天外飛來，給我無限的安慰，就像今晚這樣。」</p>
<p>「謝謝！」她徹底　　歐美女子的說話方式，謝謝人家稱讚她美麗，而實際上，她東方本色的天性，呌她連鬢脚一片都飛紅了，頭也快要低下了。幸虧一眼看見自己面前那杯「勝利飲」，上面浮着一片橘心，橘心上面，嵌着一粒鮮紅的外國櫻桃，好像在招呼她說：「快飲」口罷，你還有勝利的機會哩！」</p>
<p>「鶴見君，」她從麥管裏，吸了一口橘汁後，覺得沁人脾裏，果然提起了新的勇氣；把鶴見那近乎輕薄的語調，從心理上，顚倒過來，作爲誠意的讚美。她自己也站在受之無愧的立塲上，把剛才那個機械的，勉强的「謝謝」，重新用比較自然而擾美的聲謁，重複了一句「謝謝你的誇獎……除了我的母親和鏡子外面的我本人以外，今天還是第一次，聽見人這麽誠意的誇焚我咧。不過……」</p>

<p>洽老一生致力於振興實業，致力於社會福利事業，特別對於上海社會的貢獻，幾無人不知，我們再看他生前的志願中，所欲舉辦的事業，還有四明大學，四明中學，洽卿醫院，水產學校等，就知道這個人在如何地殫精竭慮在爲公衆謀福利。</p>

<p>前數日、在本刊上看到問眞君一篇『勿忘「本埠」』的文章；因爲我是郵局中的一個揀信員，我覺得現在有很多人，對於寫在信封上的寄件人和收件人的姓名地址，都不能按照習慣的格式寫。如間眞君所說寫「本埠」信，在路名上冠以「本埠」兩字，固須注意；但今天我提出一件須請各界格外注意的事，就是現在有人往往寫信封上的寄件人和收件人姓名地址混寫倒置，這對於我們揀信員的揀信時的速度和準確，有很大的影一響。譬如最近在市上出售的美國製航空信封箋；因其一紙可作二用，（反面可寫信，正面印有信封格式，信寫好後，只要照正面所印格式摺疊後，便成一信了）故用此箋寫信的人很多。這種航空信箋，在美國人是專用作　航空信的，但到了我們國人手裏，却連寫平信，也用這種航空信封箋了，這可不論。但按照正面上所印信封格式，在左上角有橫處線處，係備書寄件人姓名地址。右上角空白處，係貼郵票者，中間大空白方格內，係書收件人姓名地址的而現在有很多人却任意亂書。在虛線處寫收件人姓名地址，在大空白內反寫着寄件人姓名地址；有的則在貼郵票的空白內寫寄件人姓名地址，在虛線處寫收件人姓名地址，而在中間大空白內却貼上多枚的另數郵票；有的則在大空白內同時寫上寄件人和收件人的姓名地址；有的直寫，有的橫寫。像這樣橫直，上下，左右不分的亂寫，眞使我們揀信員見了頭痛，因爲揀信時務求迅速準確。若遇到這種亂寫的信，却需化上半分或一分鐘的時間，來替它辦淸寄件人和收件人的姓名地址。有時在寄件人末不寫一個「緘」字，因分不淸寄件人和收人的姓名地址；還得看郵局日戳上的地名，來分判它何者是寄件人姓名地址，何者是收件人姓名地址。假使每封信都要這樣仔細細地看，那我們怎能在有限的時間內趕着揀淸成堆的信呢？</p>
<p>還有一點，有幾家商號所用的中式店名信封，每將店名印在信封左下角，將該店的地址却印在右上角，這亦是要不得的。</p>
<p>所以各界如要求信件的寄遞迅速，這還在乎寫信時務請將寄件人和收件人的姓名地址，按照習慣分寫淸楚。最後還有一點，亦請各界注意，寫地址時，不要將地名寫錯。譬如要寄「南市夢花街」的，而寫成了寄「南京夢花街」。這種寫法，我們明知是筆誤，但他寫了「南京」，我們又不能替他改，或許「南京」亦有「夢花街」呢？如果他本意的確欲寄至「南市夢花街」，但因一字之錯，我們也只好給它到「南京」去兜上一個來回六百二十餘公里的大圈子了！</p>
<h3 id="c189">你可能答得出：世界共有多少國？ <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>

<p>『世界上究竟有多少國家？『這實在是一個很有趣的問題，許多人想知道它，但是我相信絕大多數的人回答不出這個問題。原因是：世界之大，地面之廣，除了那些舉足輕重，名氣嚮亮的大國如美，英·蘇，法等自然是決不會忘記外，還有那些僻處一隅，『與世無爭』的小國，就不大很『了然』了。臀如說吧，『沙馬瑞諾』San　Marina在什麼地方？『利克頓斯泰恩』Liectenstein有多少人口？大多數人會『瞪目結舌』起來，不知所對。平時好像也沒有看到過一本關於世界各國統計的書籍，因此，『全世界有多少國？』一直是一般人心目中的謎。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我來告訴你吧：世界上現在共有六十九國，（朝鮮及外蒙古共和國尚未算入。）</p>
<p>這六十九國名單，地圖上全有，這里不便抄襲，下面是些不常見的國家『芳名』，如果你覺得陌生，就察一察地圖吧：</p>

<h3 id="c190">和平之鑰 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 向之</p>
<p>在這國際風雲變幻莫測，國內糾紛益趨複雜的時期中，世界上的每一個角落都發出了和平的呼聲。十月廿七日下午，我去靑年會，聽到了政治學者顧政書先生的演講，講題爲「和平之鑰」。顧先生對國內這不和平的局面，在其語氣中極沉痛地表示惋惜，對國際間的明爭暗鬥深爲憂慮。他解說和平癥結，分析和平內容，詳盡透闢，聽者動容。今將其演詞大意，略記如决：</p>
<p>「我們需要和平，因爲我們怕懼戰爭。戰爭是集體的殺戳，戰爭是人類歡性的表現，戰爭是大規模的破壞，戰爭是人類文明的毀滅。美國杜魯門總統曾表示過，第三次世界大戰不發生則已，如果發生的話，世界即臨末日。因爲這次大戰如果發生的話，原子能宇宙光等科學殺人利器，將被大量地應用，全世界人類可以在短時期中宣告毀滅，你我都將化爲塵土，烟霧。因之，我們盼望和平，全世界和平，永久的和平。</p>
<p>但我們怎能得到永久的和平呢？我們不必遠求，祇要研究「和平」一詞，便可得到和平的關鍵。和平一詞，英文是Peace，這字的中文註釋可有三種譯法：（一）和平，（二）平安，（三）太平。</p>
<p>現在我們先看和平的「和」字。「和」乃由「禾」「口」合成。「禾」者米也，「口」者人也。人人口裏有飯吃，那不是萬事和好了嗎？這是一個經濟的問題。</p>
<p>决看平安的「安」字。「安」乃由「宀」「女」合成。「宀」者「家宅」也，「女」者主婦也。家家有人管理，秩序井然，這不是成了個理想社會嗎？同時，在「宀」底下，造字者祇放一個「女」字，意思是說一家若有了二個主婦，家宅即將感受不安。總之，必使人人各得其所，以臻「老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，鰥寡孤獨廢疾者皆有所養，」的境地。這是一個社會的間題。</p>
<p>再看太平的「平」字。「平」乃由「二」「半」合成。這可解爲「二人站在同一平面上」或「二人一心」的意思。也就是說人人平等，和平相處，共同追求和平的意思。如能這樣，不是離我們的理想社會很近了嗎？這是一個道德的問題。</p>
<p>如說這三個基本原則，能深印在全世界偉大政治家的心目中，列入社會改造家的計劃中，滲透進聯合國機構中，那末，我們必能免去第三次大戰的浩劫，而確保世界的永久和平。』</p>
<p>最後，顧先生引基督敎聖經中的一段話，警告說：</p>
<p>「凡一國自相分爭，就成爲荒塲，一城一家自相分爭，必站立不住！」</p>
<h3 id="c191">政府聲言提倡國貨官方配給麥爾登呢 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>原來當局嘉惠公敎人員，實施「配給」，配給的物品，都是道地的美國貨！</p>
<p>自從　貨傾銷以來，國產貨品因成本過重，以致乏人問津，造成國貨工商業界的危機，甚至於工廠關閉！在掙扎中的廠商，爲前途計，遂聯合起來，大聲疾呼，希望人民愛用國貨，以「用國貨最光榮」爲口號；籍此挽救頽風。</p>
<p>政府各級人員，也焦心操思的爲國貨界謀出路，像放長外匯啊！工商貸款啊！在上海又有取締美貨攤販啊……等等、直接間接的扶助國貨工商，不能說不出力。</p>
<p>然而有一件奇怪的事，在提倡國貨和挽救工商的熱烈聲中出現，大衆也安之若素，各無異言。其實無異是强有力的諷刺，眞是笑煞外國人！</p>
<p>公務人員穿了麥爾登呢的中山裝，還要獎勵人民「愛用　貨最光榮」。老百姓們還肯領敎嗎？所以如果當局眞的要提倡國貨，至少要在配給物品中增加國貨，减少美貨，否則有些自打耳光了。</p>

<p>— 言者</p>
<p>「丘八持票空興歎，時間訂得不適當；十二點鐘正吃飯，吃完去看戲已散！」</p>
<p>一到了星期五，每個爲着公務繁纏人的腦子中都在準備過「週末」，在學校，工廠中都有「週會」，「週末茶會」，「週末晚會」的舉行，以很快樂的情緒，來恢復一週間辛勞疲乏的精神，</p>
<p>今日在「兵」的集團中，週末當然也循例有消遣的舉動，在滬市的「兵」機關，還有各大戲院贈送週末招待劵之舉，這眞是眼福不淺，使得「丘八先生『笑遂顏開。</p>
<p>星期五下午，招待券來了，紅綠花紙一大紮，黃后，黃金，大光明，國際，平劇，電影，紹劇，巾曲是配得多麼的合調，隨情所欲，欣賞娛樂，可是美中不足，招待時間是在中午，適爲「丘八先生」作息表上上飯時間—十二時—若遙遠的跑去，不負『招待之情」準時到達，這一餐中飯就得　牲，若要「　了眼睛」僅有「害了肚皮」。</p>
<p>有些人情願肚皮受罪，不負厚情，準時到達，但是「心驚肉跳」，「片刻不安」，爲的是週末下午並無放假規定，照常辦公，若一不巧，主辦的公事來了，待你返來，官腔牌頭早己降到身上！</p>
<p>何苦，何苦！在苦中作樂來度週末，爲了「樂」中有「苦」，所以都「望票興嘆「！</p>
<p>特別爲了盛情招待國軍所印好的紅綠券，丟在抽屜角落不知凡幾？棄之可惜，取之無用，僅有將每次贈給的招待券，用一本簿子粘貼起來，作成一本上海各戲院票探大觀，彙了數百數千張，還可在好奇心的身上賺了一筆錢呢！</p>
<p>「丘八先生」的紀律一天整　一天，娛樂塲所秩序隨之增進，每人的心裏，都希望「招待國車」的時間，改在星期天不妨礙「營菜」情况下舉行，那麽，主客雙方，皆大歡喜！</p>
<p>附打油詩一首，敬致戲院老板：</p>
<p>辛勞五天週末到，承謝老闆送戲票，</p>
<p>紅綠花紙一大堆，印刷之費吃了虧，</p>
<p>丘八持票空興嘆，時間訂得不適當，</p>
<p>十二點　正吃飯，吃完去看戲己散，</p>
<p>若不吃飯肚皮空，匆匆返部要辦公；</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Assembly Discusses Rules of Procedure; Chapters 1, 2, and 3 Completed Smoothly This Morning <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Presidium of the General Assembly held its third meeting on the evening of the 25th and passed two resolutions: (1) Regarding the date of the second General Assembly, it was resolved to hold it at 9:00 AM on November 26th, and Representative Yu Youren was appointed as the Chairman of the Assembly. (2) Regarding the Democratic Socialist Party's nomination of Representatives Li Daming and Xu Fulin as members of the Presidium, it was resolved to present this to the second General Assembly for reporting. As for the amendments proposed during the General Assembly on the 25th regarding Chapter 4 of the draft rules of procedure, the suggestions were extensive and profound, and they are still being categorized into oral and written forms, with the aim of presenting them at the second General Assembly on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] At 3:20 PM on the 25th, the National Assembly continued its meeting, still presided over by Chairman Chiang. After Hong Youlan reported that there were 1,070 people present, Chairman Chiang requested Hu Shi, the Chairman elected by the Presidium, to report on the decisions of the Presidium meeting held at noon, stating: "Regarding the method of discussing the rules of procedure, after the second Presidium meeting, another discussion was held. It was considered that forming another review committee would be time-consuming and difficult to manage. In the previous discussion on how to generate candidates for the Presidium, most of the review committee members were senior and respected representatives who were reluctant to speak much. Therefore, it was proposed that the General Assembly directly discuss each chapter. This morning, the General Assembly resolved to first submit it for review. After the Presidium held an ad hoc meeting at noon to discuss, considering the practical difficulties of forming another review committee, it was decided to recommend to the General Assembly that the entire body act as the review committee for preliminary review. Now, I ask for your decision." After Hu's report, representatives such as He Foqing from the Henan region spoke successively, generally stating: The Presidium's resolution cannot overturn the General Assembly's resolution. The General Assembly's resolution from the morning should be maintained, and representatives should be nominated by each unit to review. At this point, Chairman Chiang stood up to explain, saying: "The Presidium's suggestion is not to overturn the General Assembly's resolution, but merely to seek the General Assembly's opinion based on the Presidium's view. When the General Assembly is in session, on the one hand, opinions should be widely solicited, and on the other hand, time should also be considered. Replacing the small group review committee with a review committee of the whole allows everyone to have more opportunities to speak. This suggestion is truly absolutely democratic. May I take a vote on this suggestion again?" The proposal was approved by the audience with enthusiastic applause. The vote resulted in 757 votes in favor, passing by a majority. Thus, the entire review committee began its work at 3:40 PM, proceeding with chapter-by-chapter discussion. Those requesting to speak flocked to the podium. For Chapter 1, "General Provisions," some suggested adding a clause to the rules of procedure stating that representatives should not be held responsible for their speeches within the Assembly, while others proposed that there was no need to readjust the seating of the General Assembly representatives and requested that Article 5 be repealed or revised. The former was not established because the General Assembly Organization Law already had a statement on the matter, and the latter was not established because the Presidium believed that there was a practical need to adjust the seating. Chapter 1 was passed as originally worded. In Chapter 2, "Review of Representative Qualifications," it was smoothly passed after Representative Er Yi suggested that a strict investigation should be conducted into representatives who had engaged in acts of betrayal. In Chapter 3, "Meetings," regarding Article 14, the point that a representative's withdrawal would not affect the quorum, some requested that a special provision be made for the quorum for voting on the Constitution. Because the General Assembly Organization Law already stipulated this, a vote was taken with 729 people in favor (out of 1,249 people present), and the original proposal was maintained.</p>
<p>Discussion on "Motions" Chapter - Representatives Speak Enthusiastically</p>
<p>At this point, discussion began on Chapter 4, "Motions," and the atmosphere in the venue became tense. More than eighty representatives presented opinions or expressed them orally. They spoke enthusiastically and delivered impassioned speeches. In the eleven articles of the chapter, except for Articles 21, 23, 25, 27, and 28, there were many proposed amendments. Summarizing the main points of the representatives' speeches, they were roughly as follows: In Article 18, the nature of motions should not be narrowly restricted, and it should be changed to "motions may be freely proposed by all representatives." In Article 19, the motion on the date of implementation of the Constitution should be proposed by the General Assembly representatives according to the Organization Law, and detailed and legal procedures should be made for the government to propose the draft Constitution in order to respect the power of the National Assembly, the highest political organ in the country. Looking at the constitutional history of democratic countries around the world, the draft Constitution is not limited to being proposed by the National Government. In Article 20, there is no need for such special provisions regarding amendments to the draft Constitution and the date of constitutional implementation when they are resubmitted. In Article 22, although the review of the draft Constitution is said to be divided into chapters and groups, the groups should be clearly listed. In Article 24, reducing the number of co-signers required to propose amendments to the draft Constitution and the point that representatives participating in each review group should not propose amendments to the results of their group's review are undemocratic and unreasonable. The minority opinions in the small group may be the majority opinions in the General Assembly. This restriction should be removed or conditionally amended so that those holding minority opinions in each review group have the opportunity to express their reserved opinions in the General Assembly. In Article 26, the point that temporary motions must be in writing and must be co-signed by more than one hundred people does not consider the facts and is unreasonable. Temporary motions should not be limited to writing, and one hundred people should be reduced to the minimum number. Regarding this chapter, the representatives put forward more than one hundred opinions. The General Assembly took a break from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM. The discussion finally concluded at 6:10 PM. Chairman Chiang announced: "The Presidium will hold a meeting after the adjournment to summarize the many opinions on Chapter 4 and present them to the General Assembly on the 26th." Finally, Hong Lanyou reported: "After the meeting, please ask all the Chairmen of the Presidium to gather in the Presidium's lounge. The time for the second General Assembly will be notified after the Presidium decides." The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM, just as dusk was falling and heavy rain was pouring down. This first General Assembly, full of democratic spirit, thus came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Details of the Morning Session <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The first General Assembly of the National Assembly began at 10:15 AM on the 25th. The Guofu Road and National Assembly Hall, which had been quiet for two days, became lively again. At 10:12 AM, Chairman Chiang stepped onto the podium and took his seat. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 1,604 representatives had registered and 1,248 representatives were present, which was sufficient for a quorum. He announced the opening of the meeting. Everyone stood at attention, and Chairman Chiang led the customary salute and observed a moment of silence to pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs and the soldiers and compatriots who died in the War of Resistance. Then, the reporter read the minutes of the fourth preparatory meeting and letters and telegrams of leave from representatives. Secretary-General Hong reported on the decisions of the second Presidium meeting: (1) The methods and list of Presidium subgroups (see today's newspaper, only Zhou Yongneng of the first group and Ding Weifen of the fifth group were swapped, with no other changes). (2) Rules for attending the National Assembly. (3) According to Representative Sun Mujia et al., fifty-one people, along with the National Assembly Candidate Association and the Chongqing Branch, Sichuan Branch, Henan, and other National Assembly candidates such as Li Ding et al., requested permission for representative candidates to attend the meeting. After investigation, there is no such provision in the Organization Law of this General Assembly, and the seating in the meeting place is limited. The request should not be discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Shanghai Garrison Commander May Be Appointed Soon <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The military service authorities are taking the selection of the person in charge of military administration in Shanghai very seriously. The second class of military service personnel training has now graduated, and the selection of the Shanghai Garrison Commander can be made in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wu Zhaoxu's Opinion <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang then stood up and invited the chairmen of the first group of the Presidium to the stage. At this point, Wu Zhaoxu, a representative from the Shanxi region in the 1,776-seat gallery, stood up to speak, stating two opinions: "(1) In the letters officially exchanged between Chairman Chiang and Mr. Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 23rd, the point that 'all parties should be responsible for passing the revised draft Constitution of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) within the National Assembly' is a violation of democratic principles. No party can force the National Assembly to accept the Constitution that it intends. (2) There are few democratic elements in the draft rules of procedure, especially in the chapter on 'Motions,' which restricts our freedom to express our opinions and affects the formulation of the Five-Power Constitution and the Three Principles of the People charter that the whole country expects. Please pay attention to this important procedural law to avoid being deprived of the opportunity to speak." After Wu finished speaking, Chairman Chiang said: "The exchange of letters between myself and Mr. Zhang is another matter and will be explained later. Now, according to the agenda, the draft rules of procedure will be read once before we begin the discussion." After the reporter finished reading the draft, Secretary-General Hong further explained the draft: "(1) The procedural law is based on the parent law and specifies the concrete points for applying the parent law. The National Assembly Organization Law has already stipulated this, so this draft will not be relisted or changed. (2) The draft rules list the key points to avoid being cumbersome. (3) The draft rules are based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 'Preliminary Steps to Democracy' and refer to the rules of procedure of various countries. (4) The restrictions on applying for speaking are because the meeting place is large, there are many representatives, and to avoid confusion and ensure equal opportunities to speak, the regulations are clearly listed." He then clarified the key points and intentions of each chapter. At this point, it was 11:10 AM, and requests to speak were flying to the podium like snowflakes. Chairman Chiang announced a recess.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chairman Chiang's Reply <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 11:30 AM. First, Chairman Chiang replied to Representative Wu Zhaoxu's opinion, saying: "The exchange of letters between myself and Mr. Zhang is a matter outside the meeting and has nothing to do with the affairs of the General Assembly. When the PCC closed, I stated that the establishment of the revised Constitution could bind party members, but I had no right to interfere with the National Assembly." (Applause) This exchange of letters was made by me in the name of the Kuomintang Director-General and was limited to the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party. It has no binding force on the General Assembly. As for the point that there are too few democratic elements in the rules of procedure, everyone can discuss and amend them as much as possible. However, democracy must be established under the law. The Founding Father also showed us this. I hope that all representatives will enthusiastically express their opinions within the legal scope for everything submitted for discussion to achieve perfection." (Loud applause) Then, Sun Jianmin, a representative from the Henan region, spoke, requesting that "the drafting of the Constitution should not be done behind closed doors. We must listen to the reports of public opinion from representatives from all regions and the policy reports from various government departments. However, we must not be emotional or stubborn. We must be enthusiastic, conscientious, and work for the country and the people to formulate a century-long law." At this point, Chairman Chiang announced, "Now we will only discuss the method of discussing the draft rules of procedure. Please speak on this topic and do not go off-topic." Opinions were divided, and a heated debate unfolded. Finally, it was put to a vote. Kong Geng, a representative from the Hubei region, said that the opinion of "submitting it for review before further discussion" passed with 731 votes. Chairman Chiang said, "The method of review will be decided by the Presidium and reported in the afternoon." Secretary-General Hong then stood up and reported, asking all Presidium representatives to gather in the meeting room to hold a meeting. The General Assembly will continue at 3:00 PM. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] After the Yalu River Railway Bridge, which connects Andong with transportation in Korea, was blockaded by both sides, there has been no international traffic. On the 23rd, the Supreme Command of the Soviet occupation forces in northern Korea dispatched representatives across the river to Andong to meet Commander Zhao Gongwu for an informal reception and discussed various local issues. Zhao readily agreed to provide assistance where possible, and the Soviet envoys returned satisfied. Zhao also plans to send Lei Kewen, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, as a representative to northern Korea for a formal visit soon. The Soviet authorities stated that the CCP issue is an internal affair of China and will not affect Sino-Soviet relations in any way due to the CCP.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Wang Chonghui Discusses the New Constitution - Based on Principles Formulated by the PCC - The Chapter on the Administrative System Is the Most Important <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Wang Chonghui, the compiler of the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, told our reporter on the 25th that the more the constitution of a country is accepted by the majority of the people, the better. At the very least, it must be satisfactory to the majority of the people. In a democratic system, everyone can express their opinions, especially when discussing the Constitution. Good opinions can be put forward as much as possible. However, I hope that the discussion will have results. After a majority decision is made, I hope that all parties can comply with it. This draft amendment to the Constitution is based on the principles formulated by the PCC and is a comprehensive product, which is different from the Five-Five Draft Constitution based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. However, one point must be pointed out, that the constitutions of most countries are mostly formulated by compromising the opinions of all parties. It is not easy to seek a constitution that can be implemented by one ideology. When the United States drafted its constitution, there were fierce disputes, and its constitution was formulated by compromising the opinions of all parties. The formulation of the new French constitution is not based solely on the claims of one party. Wang said that the most noteworthy issue in the new draft constitution is the responsibility of the administration to the legislature, saying: The new system is a new system between the presidential system and the cabinet system, because the cabinet system frequently collapses, which seems unsuitable for China, which needs stability. However, if the presidential system is implemented, there are concerns that the ruling party may act arbitrarily. The new system was proposed by compromising the two. This chapter is important, because whether and how politics can be promoted is related to it. There is also a new proposal for the chapter on local and central governments. This chapter is drafted based on the principle of balanced power. After the powers of the central and local governments are clearly defined, disputes will only arise when there is ambiguity between the two. However, this situation is not common after all.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The submission of the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China to the National Assembly may have to wait until the rules of procedure are passed by the National Assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Zhang Junmai Engages in Writing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Several representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party arrive in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Mr. Zhang Junmai came to Shanghai, he lived in seclusion and received only one guest, Mr. Chen Guangfu, who had just returned from Jiujiang. The Fan Yuan residence has also been heavily guarded, with the shutters down, which reminds people of the busy visits a month ago. Zhang has decided to engage in writing, and the date of his departure to Peiping has not been determined.</p>
<p>Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, said yesterday that since the Democratic League had clearly announced at a press conference in Nanjing on the 24th that the Democratic Socialist Party was considering withdrawing from the League, the Democratic Socialist Party would have to consider withdrawing from the League. Mr. Junmai told him that it would be best if democracy and peace could be achieved simultaneously. If peace cannot be achieved for a while, but democracy can still move forward one step, the Democratic Socialist Party is still unwilling to give up the opportunity to promote democracy. The Democratic Socialist Party has its own position, so it decided to participate in the National Assembly with conditions. Regarding the draft amendment to the Constitution, Sun said that opinions vary from all walks of life, and criticism is inevitable. Ta Kung Pao ridiculed the chapter on basic national policy as a slogan. However, it is not known that this chapter is actually based on the opinions of Mr. Zhou Enlai. At that time, it was dictated by Zhou and recorded word by word by someone. As for the first article of the first chapter, which states: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people," some people criticized the phrase "owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people" as superfluous. In fact, it is also based on the agreement of that year and was not invented by the drafters. When asked by reporters how the Democratic Socialist Party would be positioned when the Democratic League would be holding a meeting in Shanghai in the next few days and Zhang Lan would come to Shanghai to preside over it, Sun replied: It is difficult to say at present whether the Democratic Socialist Party will receive an invitation to the meeting. When the Youth Party left the Democratic League in the past, the Democratic League formally did not invite them to the meeting. Sun also said that the Democratic Socialist Party would not issue any statement replying to the Democratic League.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Xianzi and Hong Shaozhi, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party to the National Assembly, arrived in Nanjing from Hong Kong at 5:00 PM on the 25th. After disembarking, they visited Jiang Yuntian and Xu Chuanlin, etc. It is reported that Wu et al. plan to decide on the date of registration after meeting with Zhang Junmai, and it is also heard that Zhang Junmai will return to Nanjing from Shanghai in the next few days. In addition, Luo Jingxuan, a female representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 25th and went to Shanghai for business. She will come to Nanjing for registration in the next few days. In addition, several representatives of the party in Peiping are scheduled to come to Nanjing from Peiping on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Shi Zhiquan, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, will fly to Nanjing with Ji Yiqiao on a China Aviation flight on the morning of the 26th. Another representative, Wang Zhihai, is waiting for a flight in Peiping and is expected to travel in a day or two.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Due to the issue of participating in the National Assembly, the internal rift in the Democratic Socialist Party is becoming increasingly apparent. Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, important members of the Democratic Socialist Party in Peiping, issued a letter to Zhang Junmai today, stating their opposition to participating in the National Assembly. If the headquarters cannot reverse this move, the three of them will withdraw from the Democratic Socialist Party. Hu Haimen also had a private letter stating that he was instructed to return to Peiping to explain the participation in the National Assembly to his colleagues, but his colleagues here still cannot understand it. He hoped that his brother would come to Peiping in person, otherwise the party would be split. Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui exchanged opinions at Hu's residence yesterday and finally made this decision.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Under the active activities of the Communist Army in Shanxi, Datong is again in danger. The Communist Army is attacking the outlying strongholds of Datong. Rencun in the south has fallen again. Jilugang in the west has also fallen again after days of fierce attacks by the Communist Army. Kouquanxiaoling is still under fierce attack.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] At 10:00 PM on the 24th, a unit of the Communist Army's Police 1st Brigade and more than 5,000 militiamen from Licheng County launched a fierce attack on the Ninth Slave Mountain and Black Peak Pass defense line of the National Army 20 kilometers south of Jinan City. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist Army suffered heavy casualties. At dawn on the 25th, the Communist Army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. Another unit of more than 3,000 of its backbone regiment has arrived at Heishan to the southwest of Mingshui on the 25th to harass Mingshui. According to reports, the Police 1st Brigade was previously moved from Taian. This attack on the outskirts of Jinan City is the fifth offensive by the Communist Army in Shandong after the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] The Communist Army has decided to launch a major war in southeastern Shandong Province. Because the National Army holds the Jiaoji Railway, the Communist Army has no corridor to Jiaodong, so it is the focus of the Communist Army's desperate fight. Recently, senior generals of the Communist Army held a secret meeting and decided to use the Muling Pass at the border of Yishui and Linqu, the Tongling Pass at the border of Linqu and Boshan, the Jinyang Pass at the border of Xintai and Laiwu, and the Tianmen Pass at the border of Zhangqiu and Taian as its last base in Shandong. Once the deployment is completed, it will begin to attack the National Army. It is expected that everything east of the Jinpu Road and south of the Jiaoji Road will be spared from becoming war zones in the future. More than 40,000 people from the Communist Army's New Fourth Army moved from Zhucheng to Ducun, 10 kilometers southwest of Jiaoxian, on the 22nd. There have been no changes north of the Jiaoji Road recently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] More than 15,000 people from the Communist Army's New Fourth Army's Third Column have been collecting more than 200 boats in the area 40 li north of Suqian in recent days, attempting to cross the Grand Canal and attack the west. More than 10,000 Communist troops in southern Shandong have been wandering around Zouwudongxiji and other places more than 30 li east of Lincheng in recent days, destroying many sections of the tracks, bridges, and power lines of the Linzao branch line. They have now retreated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] The Communist Army in the northern section of Pinghan has become more active. Wangdu County has again fallen into the hands of the Communist Army. The situation in Yi County is still at a stalemate. Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 53rd Army, came to Peiping from the Northeast. After visiting Sun Lianzhong yesterday, he went to the command post in Baoding to command his troops. The defense of the area will be the responsibility of the 53rd Army. The 94th Army is still in the Zhuoxian area.</p>

<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>First Session of the National Assembly: Scattered Notes</p>
<p>At the first session of the National Assembly on the 25th, Chairman Chiang personally presided. He was wearing a khaki military uniform and sat in the center of the rostrum on a high-backed chair. The gold stars on his collar tabs, the gold badges of the National Assembly representatives, and the gold lettering on the vermilion sashes of the presidium shimmered under the bright mercury lights. Several tense moments during the proceedings were smoothly overcome thanks to Chairman Chiang's composure and decisiveness, and the agile handling of Secretary-General Hong, who was seated to his left. The entire session was imbued with democratic elements, seeking common ground amidst differences. When Chairman Chiang invited the members of the first group of the presidium to ascend the rostrum, Secretary-General Hong repeatedly announced that the first group to go up were those seated downstairs, the first to go up was Hu Shih in a blue robe, black jacket, and gold-rimmed glasses. The second group were those seated upstairs, with the corpulent Kong Xiangxi in a gray suit leading the way. Gu Zhenggang and Huang Guoshu deferred to each other behind him. The last to go up was Ahamadjan, a young and capable man wearing a velvet cap and a dark cyan Mao-style suit. Ding Weifen resigned and did not go up.</p>
<p>Wang Liwen, Fei Xia, and Bao Deming, three female representatives, sat together chatting idly. Wang said to Fei, "It's better to speak less," and Bao said, "It's not easy to get a chance to speak."</p>
<p>Wu He (Wu Xu), who was known in the Political Council for being bold and eloquent, was the first to express opinions and fired two cannons: one questioning Chairman Chiang, and the other reminding the assembly. Chairman Chiang, after sitting there twirling his beard, stood up and explained amicably, which won him a lot of applause.</p>
<p>One representative, wearing a neat naval uniform, ran into Chen Cheng during the break and gave a respectful forty-five-degree bow. Chen Cheng returned the greeting and smiled.</p>
<p>During the break: Sun Ke and Wang Yunhui sat in the lounge drinking tea and speaking Cantonese fluently. A reporter next to them asked his colleague, "Has President Sun arrived?"</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi is always the target of reporters' competition. During the break, he was again surrounded by newspaper reporters from out of town who were asking for inscriptions and autographs. "Please write down the newspaper's name!" "Please advise our newspaper!"</p>
<p>Regarding the method of discussing the revision of the rules of procedure, everyone spoke one after another. Kong Geng, with his silver beard, stepped onto the podium for the first time. The chairman asked him to submit his "request to speak" and wait his turn. After the break, it was his turn to speak. He advocated that each unit should nominate one or two representatives to meet first, review and summarize opinions, and then the assembly would discuss them. "This is the experience I have gained in the Political Council for seven years. Otherwise, one person speaks east and another speaks west, and the meeting will be thrown into chaos. At the same time, it is too disrespectful to Chairman Chiang, the head of state."</p>
<p>Duan Jianmin from Tongshan Irrigation, when he got the opportunity to speak, generously stated his views. The time was up, but Secretary-General Hong forgot to ring the bell. Chairman Chiang looked at his watch and gave a reminder, and then the bell rang...</p>
<p>When voting on the method of discussion, there were a total of three opinions. 698 people supported discussing it chapter by chapter, which was half a vote short of half of the number of attendees "1397". Kong Xiangxi added one vote, which passed half. However, the assembly still requested that the other two opinions be voted on. As a result, 146 people supported general discussion, and the lights on the voting machine were sparse. 731 people supported submitting it for review first, and the voting machine was densely filled with stars. Mr. Kong finally won.</p>
<p>The National Assembly continued its session in the afternoon. After Representative Hu Shih, as the chairman, reported on the decision suggested at the midday meeting, the opinions were divided and it became impossible to proceed. Chairman Chiang stood up and said, "Slow down, let me explain first, please wait a moment before speaking." After he explained reasonably and empathetically, the situation calmed down.</p>
<p>After the first three chapters of the draft rules of procedure were successfully passed, the fourth chapter began with a special feel. Representative Chen Tongzhou from Fujian stood up, "Chairman, number 465 requests to speak." "Wait a moment." "This is the review meeting, and I want to speak between the third and fourth chapters of the draft, please allow me to speak." "It's not that you're not allowed to speak, please wait until the original text of the draft is read out before speaking." The chairman's amiability and composure made him sit down again.</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth chapter, the number of speakers was innumerable. Secretary-General Hong reported twice, "There are too many requests to speak. Those who can have their remarks read out, please do not speak. If there are any additions, please come in order." Later, everyone became tired, and fewer people spoke. Only Secretary-General Hong was heard reading out written opinions in a calm voice with a Yangzhou accent.</p>
<p>Many representatives had particularly loud voices, which caused the loudspeakers to squeak. Secretary-General Hong helplessly explained, "When using the loudspeaker, the distance should be moderate, the height should be adjusted, and the volume should be especially controlled, please pay attention." But not long after, a certain representative shouted loudly again, and the whole audience could not hear what he was saying, making them both cry and laugh. Secretary-General Hong waited for him to shout, and then said humbly, "Please pay attention: the sound is not good, too loud, too high, too loud, too high, unpleasant to listen to!"</p>
<p>During the afternoon break, Representative Luo Shu took a piece of paper and went around looking for people to sign. The reporter ran up and asked, "Mr. Luo must have some brilliant ideas?" He said busily, "No, no, this is a matter for the Political Council; let me tell you a piece of news: the Political Council Friendship Association can be established next week."</p>
<p>Liu Huai, a Shanxi district representative with white hair and eyebrows, spoke on Articles 18 and 19 in a peaceful and orderly tone, using precise and relatable examples. His speech won unanimous praise, and everyone said "This old man makes sense."</p>
<p>The steps to the left of the rostrum were full of reporters, men and women, red and green, thin and fat, sitting and leaning. It was the most complicated and natural corner in the assembly hall.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned when it got dark. Outside the hall, it was raining heavily, and everyone was crowded at the gate and under the corridor, with a sense of "unable to proceed." A colleague said, "The fatigue bombing has begun, I can't take it!"</p>

The Chairman expressed his gratification with the progress of the National Assembly during the ten days since its opening. He then stated that all representatives bear a major responsibility for formulating the fundamental law of the country and determining the national political system, especially the representatives of this party, who must live up to the spirits of the late Premier and all the martyrs in heaven and complete the great task of constitution-making. The Chairman also encouraged the representatives of this party to trust each other in the party and among comrades, jointly follow the teachings of the Founding Father, implement the Three Principles of the People, and complete the revolutionary mission.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Clarifying the Spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty, U.S. Ambassador Issues Special Statement: No Harm to China's Sovereignty <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, issued an important statement on the misunderstanding caused by the Sino-U.S. Treaty at a press conference held by the U.S. Information Office at Hamilton House at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Chinese newspapers' discussions on the recently established Sino-U.S. Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation reveal that they have many misunderstandings about the nature and scope of the rights and privileges granted to the two countries, and some Chinese newspapers unreasonably point out that the United States has imposed unequal conditions on China. This treaty is definitely not like that. Since the abolition of extraterritoriality in China in 1943, a gap has arisen, and this treaty is used to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Targeting Relevant National Relations</p>
<p>In order to stipulate the conveniences that the people of these two sovereign countries should enjoy in each other's territories, such treaty provisions are necessary; at present, there are many treaties of the same nature between countries, which form a legal organization, and within this organization, countries normally maintain friendly contacts and trade activities. The Sino-U.S. Treaty of 1943 stipulated the conclusion of this treaty, because the abolition of extraterritoriality in China required a basic treaty to replace it, targeting the changed relations between the two countries, and adjusting the daily life that the people of the two countries need to implement in each other's territories. For example, this treaty allows the people of any country to travel and reside in each other's territories, as well as to conduct commercial, educational, religious, and charitable work. This treaty also provides for the leasing and ownership of land for various purposes.</p>
<p>Without such a treaty, the people of the two countries would not have the basis to carry out so many activities with each other. This treaty is of such fundamental importance. This treaty is as important to China and Chinese citizens as it is to the United States and American citizens. Undoubtedly, China must also conclude similar treaties with other countries with which she hopes to conduct mutually beneficial transactions.</p>
<p>Inaccurate Predictions and Justifications</p>
<p>Some Chinese newspapers have misunderstood the terms of the treaty, especially the most-favored-nation clause, which has led to inaccurate predictions that this treaty is the beginning of a series of new unequal treaties, which is incorrect. The fact is that the most-favored-nation clause is included in all modern commercial treaties between countries of equal status.</p>
<p>For example, a country that grants most-favored-nation treatment to the other party is not obliged to set special tax rules for tariffs or navigation rights, nor is it obliged to allow foreign ships to enter inland and coastal waterways without restriction. Under the Sino-U.S. Treaty, China does not lose its tariff autonomy or its right to control shipping and foreign trade. The foreign trade regulations recently promulgated by the Chinese government are the most sufficient proof of this fact.</p>
<p>The United States does not expect China to sacrifice its sovereignty or compromise, and there is absolutely no such provision in the treaty, but the treaty specifically stipulates that Americans in China and Chinese in the United States must not be treated with discrimination, and they all enjoy reasonable and necessary rights and conveniences in each other's countries.</p>
<p>The United States does not want, nor has it obtained, special rights in China.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At 7:00 p.m. last night, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and others from the Weekend Forum hosted a dinner for Ambassador Stuart at the World Society site on Linsen Road. Guests included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, U.S. Consul General Davis and his wife, etc. At around 8:00 p.m., Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for Ambassador Stuart at his official residence. In addition to the ambassador, those invited also included Consul General Davis and his wife and several friends of the ambassador in Shanghai. The atmosphere was very cheerful. Today at 5:00 p.m., the Yanjing University Alumni Association held a tea party at the Customs Club (Tongyi Lane, Chengdu Road, Jing'an Temple Road) to entertain the ambassador. The ambassador is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning with his spokesman, Connors, and political advisor Fu Jingbo on a special plane to return to Beijing. According to the talks, Brazil-China relations are good.</p>

<p>According to the talks, Brazil-China relations are good.</p>
<p>[This City News] Ambassador to Brazil Cheng Tianguo returned to China on the 22nd and arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, he took the night express train to Beijing to pay respects to the central authorities and report on the situation in Brazil. Before leaving Shanghai, reporters interviewed the ambassador at his hotel. According to the talks: Brazil has a vast territory and abundant resources, which is similar to our country. It has been actively engaged in construction after the war, and its achievements are quite impressive. In the past, under the dictatorial political system, there was no lack of disturbances in domestic politics. However, after the promulgation of the constitution this year and the organization of a mixed government of various parties by the new president, politics has gradually become on track, and it is rapidly becoming a model country for advocating democratic politics in Latin America. There are a total of 20 Latin American nations in South America, which have always been dominated by pro-Americanism. Their foreign policy is led by Brazil. The countries are united with each other due to their common race and culture, and their position in the United Nations organization is very important. Our country's diplomacy should pay special attention to South America in the future. He also said: Brazil's relations with our country are very good. This is because Brazil specifically gifted Chairman Chiang a first-class Grand Cordon medal, which is enough to express its respect for our country's leader; also, since the signing of the China-Brazil Cultural Agreement this year, overseas Chinese in Brazil have gained the protection of equal treatment.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Beiping at 2:10 p.m. on the 25th on a large blue plane, flying amidst cloudy skies. Mrs. Marshall, General Gillem and his wife, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, He Siyuan, Cai Wenzhi, Ye Jianying's representative Xue Yuyan, and more than 30 reporters all went to Nanyuan Airport to welcome him. After Marshall got off the plane and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one, he kissed his wife, who had come to greet him in a car and was seated due to illness. Then he was surrounded by reporters. When reporters asked Marshall if he would go to Yan'an, he replied, "Not sure." He also declined to explain his length of stay in Beiping. Then he drove to the residence of the chairman at Yu'en Temple to rest. Gillem, Sun Lianzhong, and Chen Jicheng also accompanied him. Sun, Chen, and Gillem left successively at 3:20 p.m. It is said that Mr. and Mrs. Marshall will have a Chinese dinner at the residence, which has been prepared in advance by the Ninth Reception Office of the Lizhi Society. According to news from the Foreign Affairs Office of the Headquarters, Marshall will stay in Beiping on the 26th and will visit the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills and other places.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] Marshal Marshall came, and after a brief stay in Tianjin, he flew to Beiping at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th. Marshal Marshall seemed very happy on this trip. He once said that when he revisited the streets where he had lived 20 years ago, the old scenery was still vivid, and he felt very happy. Marshal Marshall said at a tea party that his efforts over the years had failed, and he did not speculate on the prospects of peace talks, nor did he say a word about politics. He hoped that the people of the country would recognize reality and guide the country on the road to prosperity. It is reported that he once mentioned "propaganda" and said that the United States attaches great importance to propaganda.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] According to reports, Special Envoy Marshall will return to Beijing from Beiping, and may go to Yan'an from Beijing to meet with Mao Zedong and make a final effort to negotiate between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the rumors that Mao will go to Jiamusi and the CCP headquarters will also move, the CCP spokesperson said that this is impossible, because the CCP itself does not have airplanes, and the move of Yan'an will cause a loss of political center.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Director of the Information Department Explains the Truth About Sino-French Negotiations: We Will Set Up Customs in Haiphong <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Sino-French negotiations have been formally underway for more than two weeks, and people from all walks of life attach great importance to their progress. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited He Fengshan, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Information Department, and inquired about some questions. The answers were quite detailed. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What treaty is the Sino-French negotiation based on?</p>
<p>A: It is based on the Sino-French agreement on Sino-Vietnamese relations signed on February 28 this year.</p>
<p>Q: What is the scope and content of this negotiation?</p>
<p>A: In order to implement the agreement, there are many technical issues that need to be agreed upon by both parties. The main ones are that China will recover the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the principles and standards for its valuation should be discussed with the French company that originally operated the railway; secondly, if customs are set up in Haiphong, the required capacity of the docks, warehouses, and sheds must have a defined scope, and attention must be paid to the actual situation of Sino-Vietnamese trade to achieve the purpose of Sino-Vietnamese transportation. China will set up customs in Haiphong in the future only for the management of Chinese import and export goods passing through Vietnam. There is a misunderstanding that Haiphong will be designated as a free port.</p>
<p>Q: Why didn't the Vietnamese government participate in this negotiation?</p>
<p>A: This negotiation is purely a technical issue issued in accordance with the Sino-French agreement, so as to provide China with various convenient methods of transportation. It does not involve the internal affairs of the Vietnamese mainframe territory, and the Vietnamese side did not participate in this negotiation. It is an internal issue between France and Vietnam, and China is not in a position to make any claims.</p>
<p>Q: After China recovers the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, how will the railway be operated?</p>
<p>A: After China recovers the Yunnan section, its sovereignty belongs to our country. We should first try to repair the damaged sections and cooperate with the Vietnamese section on joint transportation so that Yunnan's export trade can be restored.</p>
<p>Q: The losses of our country's officials and businesses are compensated by the French side with the valuation of the Yunnan section. If the price of the road is not enough to compensate our country for the losses, will the Japanese assets in northern Vietnam be used as compensation?</p>
<p>A: Yes. As for how the compensation for the losses of officials and businesses will be distributed in the future, it is an internal matter for our country and will be handled separately by the relevant agencies.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The new Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship will be signed in the near future. Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping told reporters on the 25th that the differences of opinion between the two sides in the new Sino-Philippine Treaty have been approached, and it is expected that an agreement can be reached after he returns to the Philippines within the week. According to this new agreement, overseas Chinese in the Philippines will enjoy most-favored-nation treatment. He continued that after the new treaty is signed, the second step will be to contact for a commercial treaty, and he believes that communication and negotiation with the Philippines will be more convenient in the future. He can assert that the friendship between China and the Philippines will definitely increase day by day. The Philippine President has also repeatedly assured that the friendship between China and the Philippines will be strengthened day by day. When explaining the Filipinization Act, Chen said: The Filipinization Act rumored by foreign countries refers to the recent Labor Nationalization Act signed by the President. The act stipulates that 60% of the employees of any enterprise must be Filipinos. Overseas Chinese are subject to considerable influence. For other cases such as the priority of Filipinos for market stalls and the Filipinization of retail sales that are brewing, which are very unfavorable to overseas Chinese businessmen, the government has taken into account the preparations to take appropriate measures. Chen is scheduled to return to the Philippines within days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] The Qingdao-Gaomi section of the Jiaoji Railway was reopened to traffic on the 25th, carrying more than 1,500 passengers, with domestic goods accounting for one-third. In addition, the Qingdao-Jiaoxian section has been open to traffic for a month without major disruptions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 25th] Xi Shungeng, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, returned on the 24th after inspecting the repairs on the Jiaoji Line. According to the talks: The eastern section of Jiaoji has now been repaired to between Kangjiazhuang and Gaomi, and the western section to between Huangqibao and Zuoshan. There are still 50 kilometers that have not been repaired in the middle. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic by mid-December. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The damaged sections of the Ping-Zhang section of the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway have been repaired and are open to traffic as usual today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] A railway official stated this morning when discussing the current state of railway transportation in North China that the transportation efficiency is low due to the improper establishment of trunk line institutions, which prevents the various lines from effectively cooperating. The separation of Guannei and Guanwai on the Beining Railway makes it impossible to fully allocate vehicles. He believes that this kind of treatment is a step backward, so there is consideration. In the past, the Japanese adopted the method of setting up a general institution to unify the operation. In addition, Guannei and Guanwai and the northern provinces each govern themselves, only seeking convenience for their own management, and imposing arbitrary controls on various special products, prohibiting them from leaving the country, which also hinders the people's livelihood. Although there is a shortage of train cars now, and the railways are often damaged, the vehicles on many lines often cannot be effectively utilized and return empty due to local restrictions on the export of materials.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou dispatch from the 25th] Following the signing of the Sino-American commercial treaty, American businesses have actively begun commercial activities in China. It has been learned that an American business group has rented over a dozen shops on Jiufang Road in Wuzhou, Guangxi, specifically to procure local products such as tung oil and star anise oil for direct shipment to the United States. This also serves as a base for promoting American goods. They have also established warehouses in Huangpu, Guangzhou, and acquired two hundred steamships of up to 800 tons each to transport goods between Guangzhou and Wuzhou. This move undoubtedly marks the beginning of American businesses penetrating the mainland for economic activities, and American goods will inevitably flow throughout the country.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e33">Overseas Chinese Affairs Policy Should Be Included in the Constitution <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The revised draft of the constitution has completed its procedures in the Legislative Yuan, and the National Assembly is about to begin discussions. We feel that there are too many issues that deserve careful study, and today we will first discuss one of them.</p>
<p>We have read the current amendment from beginning to end, but we cannot find the term "Overseas Chinese Affairs." However, item 24 of Article 26 in Chapter 3 stipulates the method of representatives elected by Overseas Chinese participating in the organization of the National Assembly. As for item 13 of Article 108 in Chapter 10, which concerns immigration and land reclamation, it clearly refers to domestic immigration and land reclamation and is unrelated to Overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and Overseas Chinese are citizens of the motherland. The draft constitution seems to have covered all the rights and obligations of domestic citizens, but it does not mention a word about the twelve million Overseas Chinese who are scattered overseas and living in isolation. This is truly regrettable. We sincerely hope that the National Assembly will not forget them when drafting the constitution this time. At the same time, representatives from overseas and those in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs should not let this good opportunity pass lightly.</p>
<p>If Overseas Chinese affairs policy cannot be established as a separate chapter, it should at least be included in Chapter 13, "Fundamental National Policies," of the draft constitution. Its articles could be roughly worded as follows: "The Overseas Chinese affairs of the Republic of China shall focus on migration, colonization, conservation, and development of Overseas Chinese." Migration is a phenomenon of human movement. The conditions of migration can generally be divided into four types: invasion, conquest, colonization, and immigration. "Invasion" refers to the organized plundering of more civilized areas by culturally inferior but strong and rugged peoples. The Goths and Huns are famous historical examples. This is absolutely unlike the Japanese, who invaded our Chinese culture. "The boar and the serpent are long, recommending food to the upper country," which is the most recent act of invasion. "Conquest" often refers to a culturally more advanced nation using military force to attack a relatively backward nation, making the latter its dependency, thereby increasing its authority, expanding its territory, and seizing economic benefits. The ancient Roman Empire was such an example.</p>
<p>"Colonization" refers to a country sending its people to reside in a new territory, thereby expanding the country's political influence and obtaining economic benefits. The country of the migrants obtains control over the place of migration. This process often utilizes the activities of commercial groups, such as the East India Company, with military force as its backdrop, but not relying on naked military force. The largest colonial movement in history occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries. Countries competed for overseas influence, using colonial actions as weapons to seize overseas territories and resources. Portugal and Spain initiated this, followed by the rise of the Netherlands, England, and France, who later surpassed them. As a result of Japan's emphasis on development, the rural population flowed to the cities and also to the colonies. The increase in commodity production depended on the colonies as markets; the raw materials for production relied on the colonies for supply; and the high degree of development of monopoly capital required the colonies as places to invest surplus capital.</p>
<p>According to Fairchild's definition, "immigration" refers to the migration of a group of individuals or families who move from one country to another voluntarily and on their own responsibility. The motivation for immigration is based on personal interests and peaceful means are used to achieve the desired goals. Overseas Chinese follow this pattern. McNair explains in his book "The Overseas Chinese," "The Overseas Chinese are not colonizers." They do not come as a group, so there is no forceful seizure of land; their migration is for economic reasons rather than political ones. Therefore, they only passively resist and never actively engage, resulting in greater suffering than any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>Our country's immigration began in the Han Dynasty and flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Calling Chinese people "Tang people" and calling the places where Chinese people live "Chinatowns" shows the prosperity of the Overseas Chinese at that time. By the late Ming Dynasty, Western powers invaded the East. After the contact between Chinese and Western forces, foreigners were organized and had ambition, and the great powers divided up Southeast Asia. This fully illustrates that our Overseas Chinese are "immigrants" rather than colonizers, and certainly not invaders or conquerors. They bullied the weak and enslaved the inferior, which is truly contrary to our spirit of benevolence. Our Three Principles of the People hold that culturally advanced nations have the obligation to assist culturally backward nations, but do not advocate conquest by force.</p>
<p>Immigration is not a problem, and the colonization we propose has no political or territorial ambitions, and is actually the same as immigration, except that the word "colonization" is easier to say. The Japanese, Kojima, define the word "colonization" as "nationals of a country permanently or long-term migrating to a colony to engage in economic or military facilities," but our concept is not like this. Because Overseas Chinese have a strong sense of home, "trees are thousands of feet tall, but the leaves fall back to their roots." Even if they are not buried alive, they must return to Zhengshou Qiu after death. There is no thought of permanent migration, and there is no military background. The facts of thousands of years ago can prove this. Our colonization policy does not stimulate foreigners, so there is no need to fear foreigners and not include it in the constitution.</p>
<p>Protecting and educating Overseas Chinese is even more righteous. Which country's Overseas Chinese do not need the protection of their home country? Which country's Overseas Chinese do not need the education of their home country? Considering Overseas Chinese as "bad people" and letting them survive on their own should be put to ashes by the flames of the Anti-Japanese War. Although there is no explicit provision for the protection of Overseas Chinese in international law, customary law and factual needs have long been implemented. Chinese people have suffered from the protection of Overseas Chinese by foreigners. If there are souls, everyone will never forget it so quickly!</p>
<p>In the era of the Roman Empire, the law of personality was used purely. In short, Roman citizens were protected by law, while foreigners did not have this right. In the Middle Ages, people's residences gradually became fixed, and various ethnic groups intermarried with each other, so it gradually became difficult to apply the law of personality, and the law of the place replaced it. After the French Revolution, the theory of human rights prevailed, that is, human beings have the right to lose their assigned rights, and no matter whether they live in their own country or abroad, they cannot be violated, and the theory of protecting overseas Chinese was further established. Since the French Revolution, European countries have spared no effort to protect Overseas Chinese, and they all believe that it is the responsibility of the country, and often sacrifice the lives of other people for the sake of one or two Overseas Chinese who have been infringed upon. Since our country has a large number of people abroad, the responsibility for protection should be mentioned in the constitution.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese education is the foundation for building a prosperous Overseas Chinese community. Overseas Chinese education is a way to prevent Overseas Chinese from becoming foreigners and always loving their motherland. How can it be ignored? People maliciously prohibit our Overseas Chinese from educating people and have actively developed methods to set up free schools to recruit Overseas Chinese. What is the purpose? We must re-educate the people of Japan and Germany, we must have the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference, what is the purpose? And we ourselves seem to ignore the descendants of the Yellow Emperor abroad, whether to manage or not to manage, is it wisdom or stupidity?</p>
<p>The contribution of Overseas Chinese to the motherland is really too great! Since the Revolution, the Anti-Japanese War and the construction of the country, there is no battle that they have not participated in. How can we count the dedication of our lives and wealth? If we do not mention a word about Overseas Chinese affairs policy in the constitution, how can we be worthy of them?</p>
<p>Promoting International Cultural and Educational Cooperation</p>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is currently meeting in Paris. In addition to the election of Dr. Zhao Yuanren, our country's chief representative, as chairman of the General Assembly, Professor Chen Yuan, our country's representative, has also been elected as a member of the Executive Board of the organization with representatives from 17 other countries. The convening of this conference to promote international cultural cooperation is worthy of the attention of the world. Relations between countries and interactions between nations, although there are relations in various aspects, cultural relations are the most fundamental. As mankind enters the age of atomic energy, the invention of aviation and wireless electricity has shortened the distance of space, making the entire earth a very small unit. The various nations living on this earth should have closer cultural relations to enhance mutual understanding between them. Therefore, at this time, we should do our best to promote international cultural relations. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization convened a conference in Paris at this moment, which can be said to meet an urgent need between countries. After this, how the meeting will be held, the representatives who attend and participate have the promotion of international coordination as their ambition, and it is believed that there will be important resolutions; For the promotion of international cultural and educational cooperation, there will be very important contributions.</p>
<p>What we find regrettable is that such an important international gathering did not have the participation of the Soviet representatives, and even the observers were not sent, which is a little bit unsatisfactory. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has been devoted to the construction of socialist culture, and the country has spared no effort in promoting academic culture; and it has also established the Foreign Culture Association to seek to strengthen the cultural relations of the Soviet Union with various nations other than the Soviet Union. Professor Hua Luogeng, a famous mathematician in our country, and archaeologist Guo Moruo, who is famous for his research on Yin and Shang characters, and the famous novelist Shen Yanbing (Mao Dun), who is about to visit the Soviet Union recently, are said to have been invited by the Soviet Foreign Culture Association to visit the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is not unconcerned about the promotion of international cultural relations; However, the UNESCO General Assembly did not even send observers, which is inevitably a little disappointing. The New York Times commented on the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and said: "It is not difficult for us to understand the reason why the Soviet people are hesitant to move forward; they do not want their people to be thrown into the embrace of what they consider to be unorthodox ideas." We do not want to trace the motives of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate; But I hope that if the Soviet Union does not send representatives to this meeting, there will be representatives from the Soviet Union to add color to this international conference.</p>
<p>The use of the term "culture" also reminds people of memories that are not necessarily pleasant. From the English Cutr to the German Kuetuy, it is a disturbing memory. This Fan changed the meaning of culture. The aggressiveness of the German warlords is deeply connected with this word. In their eyes, the German army has a sacred mission to spread culture. From the Middle Ages to Hitler, this idea was deeply imprinted in the hearts of every German invader. Our neighbor, Japan, was unfortunately poisoned by this Germanic thought. Now that Hitler's party has been defeated, the era of "culture" as a weapon of warlord aggression is over. However, today, although the Prussian and Japanese warlords have been overthrown, we still see how many of the same situations are disguised under a moving coat. The true value of culture lies not in being used as a weapon, a tool, but in its natural development. It exists and develops beyond politics. If it is used as a tool, whether it falls into the hands of warlords like Prussia or Japan, the result will be the same. Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and other places all had brilliant cultures in the past; But now in the abyss of pain. The fall of Poland could not stop the production of great Polish national literature and the creation of immortal musical masterpieces. All of this is a lesson we have learned from human history.</p>
<p>International cultural and educational cooperation can have many aspects of activity, but the most basic is the communication of ideas. We talk about tariff barriers, but what is most frightening is ideological barriers. Political disputes, and its origin, is still an ideological issue. In socialist countries, all thoughts are dominated by a kind of formulaic agenda. "Words and deeds cannot escape the cage of this ideological formalism." In non-socialist countries, their ideological systems also have their own origins. Looking around the world today, we see socialist cultural fields, the so-called "Western" cultural fields, the Islamic cultural fields, and the Chinese cultural fields; Although there are not no exchanges between each other, the barriers between them are still as strict as ever. How to eliminate the barriers between each other and create a world culture in the whole world should be the goal of all nations to strive for in the future.</p>
<p>As far as we Chinese are concerned, our efforts in this regard are particularly heavy. We have always called ourselves an ancient country of culture, and the whole picture of our cultural heritage is still not known to the world. Standing on the position of the Chinese people at the present stage, today we talk about international cultural cooperation, there are two aspects of input and output: we must have a full understanding of the cultural life of other nations; We must enable other nations to have a full understanding of the cultural life of our own nation. We must enable other nations to have a full understanding and even acceptance of this expensive national cultural heritage. The development of human culture originally had the effect of mutual influence; The most brilliant period in human cultural history was also the time when this mutual influence was most obvious. In our national history, the Tang, Song and even the late Ming and early Qing dynasties need not be said, but the situation is also the same in other parts of the world. Therefore, today, we should absorb the essence of foreign cultures on the one hand, and introduce the essence of our own culture to foreign countries in a planned and organized manner on the other hand, in order to achieve the practical effect of cultural exchange. At present, the Soviet Union has an organization of foreign cultural associations, and the United Kingdom also has a British Cultural Committee. Even in the United States, there is a special office for international cultural cooperation under the State Department, which shows how much countries attach importance to promoting international cultural cooperation. Our mission in international cultural cooperation is particularly important, and it also seems that something must be structured to handle it.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Area on the Haiphong Border Bombed by French Naval and Land Forces</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 25th] French artillery and fleets today bombarded the border area of the Overseas Chinese area in Haiphong, where a number of houses were occupied by Viet Minh Republic forces. However, the French army retreated after destroying the airfield and oil depot. French officials said that Viet Minh forces had forcibly occupied a number of houses in the Overseas Chinese area, and other Viet Minh forces were concentrated south and east of Haiphong. The French army had demanded that the Viet Minh forces withdraw from the French and Overseas Chinese areas in Haiphong to avoid new conflicts. This request was rejected. Fighting broke out again this morning, and the Viet Minh forces built new obstacles. Their armed forces entered the Overseas Chinese area, and landmines were placed near French military outposts. French armored vehicles were attacked near obstacles during patrols. In retaliation, the French army shelled the border area of the Overseas Chinese area, and French warships also opened fire. As of the time of transmission, it is not known whether the war has stopped.</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou dispatch] The case of corruption by Xin Yutang, the magistrate of Pi County, has been concluded by the Tongshan District Court Procuratorate, which believes that a public prosecution should be filed. The defendant's criminal facts, evidence, and applicable laws are recorded as follows: The defendant Xin Yutang, the magistrate of Pi County, and Tang Mingyuan, Wen Huaiyun, Li Ruiwu, etc., failed to establish a Pi County Receiving Enemy and Puppet Food Management Committee in accordance with legal procedures when Japan surrendered last year. The defendant, Xin Yutang, appointed Tang Mingyuan as the director of the committee and established an office in Pao Che Town. When a Japanese officer (name unknown) and interpreter Zhao Yizhao escorted a military train through Pao Che Station, Tang Mingyuan received the goods. The enemy train was loaded with 50,000 sets of Japanese officers' and soldiers' uniforms, 10,000 boxes of 7.9 and 6.5 type rifle ammunition (totaling 10 million rounds), 8 military vehicles, 30,000 bags of wheat flour, leather belts, leather cartridge boxes, leather rings, canned food, and 6.5 rifles and mortar shells. In addition, the enemy's abandoned supplies were received in Pao Che Town, including 500,000 packages of millet, 70,000 packages of sesame seeds, 100,000 packages of white rice, 80,000 packages of castor beans, 90,000 packages of corn, 250,000 packages of peas, 330,000 packages of red sorghum, 150,000 packages of dried sweet potatoes, 280,000 pieces of soybean cake, 100,000 catties of white and red sugar, 5,000 bolts of white, blue, and colored miscellaneous cloth, and 230,000 packages of tobacco. In addition, a large-scale warehouse was built near Yunhe Town, and Li Ruiwu, his confidant, was appointed as the director of the Yunhe Town branch. It received 1.5 million packages of enemy wheat, 300,000 packages of dried sweet potatoes, 170,000 packages of corn, 160,000 packages of white rice, 130,000 packages of sesame seeds, 340,000 packages of soybeans, 130,000 packages of castor beans, 350,000 packages of peas, 460,000 packages of red sorghum, 490,000 pieces of soybean cake, 300,000 packages of tobacco leaves, and enemy coal, higher than the mountains. Wen Huaiyou, a staff member of the county government, was the receiving committee member and was responsible for handling it. In addition to daily retail sales, merchants sold it to other places (such as Huai, Si, and Gao counties) for resale. Thousands of vehicles were used every day, and it took more than a month to sell out. In addition, the exact number of supplies in Bayi Ji, Nianzhuang, Zhaodun, Caoqiao and other places is difficult to know in detail due to the rapid sale. However, the number of supplies abandoned by the enemy in Pao Che Town and Yunhe Town and other places is known in more detail because the accuser was the intelligence director of the Ninth Column of the Fifth Sub-district of the Ludong Military Region at that time. However, it is obvious that the defendants sold the received enemy and puppet supplies at low prices, and large grain merchants scrambled to buy them. After Feng Zhiqin filed a request for investigation, the investigation has now been concluded. In accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1, Section 2, of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, and Article 3, Paragraph 2, of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, the crimes are based on Article 1 of the Regulations on Special Criminal Cases, Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and a public prosecution is filed.</p>

<p>[Our Wuhu dispatch]程祥麟, the former head of the criminal investigation team of the Wuhu Police Department, who had just been dismissed three months ago, was suddenly arrested and sent to the court by the police department on the evening of the 22nd, which has attracted much attention from the community. 程 is from Hefei. He took office at the beginning of the takeover. 程 claimed to have worked as a secret agent during the war, and still had a lot of potential after his dismissal. Therefore, Tang Shengxuan, the current police chief, was very cautious when he was ordered to arrest him. He first notified the local court and sent six armed bailiffs, who were ambushed near Tang's private residence. He also prepared a grand banquet to entertain 程祥麟, so that he could be captured safely. The bailiffs immediately escorted him to the court in a rickshaw, with strict precautions along the way, and he was sent to the court for detention. In addition to being summoned to Beijing this morning to make a statement, Director Tang also announced the arrest process. He received a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior, which was forwarded to the acting President of the National Government, Chiang. It was reported that Cheng Xianglin, the head of the criminal investigation team of the Wuhu Police Department, had extorted a total of 50 million yuan from Ding Zhi San, the director of the Jiufeng Rice Mill in the county, 100 million yuan from Lou Jingui, the owner of the Yifeng Rice Shop, and 40 million yuan from Hu Shouqing, the president of the Barge Association. Sun Kekuan, a consultant to the Ministry of the Interior, also reinvestigated and found that Cheng Xianglin had indeed extorted and embezzled money. He was ordered to be responsible for arresting and sending him to the court for investigation. In addition, 23 Japanese war criminals, including Tanaka Taro, were escorted to Wuhu on the 22nd from Anqing. They were captured from Jiangxi and other places and will be transferred to Beijing for interrogation within a few days.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou dispatch, 25th] The Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate today issued arrest warrants for two traitors.

The details are as follows: (1) Lu Xipeng, secret agent of the enemy Shanghai team and pseudo-town mayor of Jiang, (2) Zhou Wenbin, deputy commander of the Yixing pseudo-self-defense regiment, repeatedly guided the enemy army to ambush and kill our underground troops, totaling more than one regiment, and also produced counterfeit money and raped women.

<p>[Our Wuxi dispatch] Gu Xieyuan, a resident of Zhujia Lane in Beixiang, 36 years old, married into the Zhang Jigen family in Wangjia Lane nearby in 1919 through an introduction. He married Jigen's daughter, Guidi. At first, the two had a very good relationship, and they had a son and a daughter. However, Gu was addicted to gambling, so the relationship between the husband and wife deteriorated day by day. Guidi was also not used to loneliness, and had an affair with Zhang Jinbao, a fellow villager. The two were very passionate, but they regarded Xieyuan as a thorn in their side. At about 3 a.m. on the 22nd, Jinbao sneaked into Gu's house in order to strike first, and used brute force to press Xieyuan, causing him to suffocate to death. By the time the neighbors discovered it and knocked on the door to enter, it was too late, and the murderer Zhang Jinbao had already fled in fear of punishment. On the morning of the 21st, Gu Yunxiong, the township head of the township, and Cheng Yizhou, the head of the township, escorted the corpse's wife, Zhang Guidi, and the suspect, Gu Shundi, to the procuratorate of the local court to report the case and request an autopsy. Prosecutor Chu opened the interrogation and ordered Zhang Guidi and Gu Shundi to be detained. At 8 a.m. on the 24th, Prosecutor Chu, together with the coroner, went to the countryside to conduct an autopsy, confirming that he had been murdered. However, his wife, Zhang Guidi, was suspected of murdering her husband. The court is stepping up its efforts to arrest the principal offender, Zhang Jinbao, and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu have established five concentration camps for refugee families in Yancheng, where they have concentrated 21,000 arrested refugee family members from the six counties of Suqian, Siyang, Huai'an, Sihong, Haizhou, and Shuyang, and are subjecting them to communist indoctrination.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Laowei area of the fifth district of Xinghua, northern Jiangsu, was renamed Jincheng Township after the Communist troops moved in, and Communist instructors Xu Guixing and Xu Xueli, and assassination team leader Xu Guofu, arbitrarily harassed and massacred wealthy households, intellectuals, and senior Central Government personnel there, implementing the so-called land reform policy, forcibly dividing landlords' land. If good citizens slightly resisted, they were labeled as reactionaries and brutally killed. Xu Guomin, a resident of the township, 28 years old, had more than 40 mu of self-cultivated land in his family, all of which was divided up, leaving only six mu for living expenses. Every night, Xu Guomin was forced to patrol and deliver messages. Xu did not dare to resist under their tyranny. However, the Communist troops feared that Xu was suffering grievances and wanted to contact the Nationalist army, so on the morning of the 20th day of the ninth lunar month, Zhang Maolin, Xu Guixing, Xu Guofan, Xu Guofu, Sun Fushi, and others swarmed to Xu's house, tied up Xu Guomin, and took him away. In Sujiazhuang, about two li away from his home, he was hacked to death with broadswords and axes. Xu's wife, Cao, went to search for him and found six corpses at the site, blood and flesh blurred, a tragic sight. The Communist troops prohibited publicizing the matter and hastily collected the bodies. Later, Xu Cao could not bear the oppression of the Communist troops, so she and her brother-in-law, Xu Guoshu, disguised themselves as beggars and fled to Wuxi, living in the home of a relative in Xibing Town in the city. Recently, Xinghua was recovered by the Nationalist army, and the local Communists mixed into refugee ships, fleeing to Jiangnan. Ten refugee ships from northern Jiangsu arrived at Xidiaqiao in this county in the past few days. The murderers Xu Guixing, Xu Xueli, and Xu Guidao also mixed among them and were identified by Xu Cao, who reported it to the first squadron of the police, and all three were arrested and sent to the general bureau. According to Xu Guixing, as a Communist instructor, he watched the murder of Xu Guomin at the scene but did not do it himself. It was all done by Zhang Maolin, Wang Fuquan, and others. On that night, they killed Su Yuesong and his son and seven others, including Zhu Fenghua. Xu Xueli said that he joined the Communist army in February of last year and was promoted to squadron leader this year. He categorically denied killing people and only admitted to holding struggle meetings and dividing Xu Guomin's land. Xu Guidao claimed that he had been a soldier in the Communist army for three years and knew nothing about the killing of people. After the police bureau took their statements, considering that the case concerned the Communist army's murder and fell under the jurisdiction of military law, they presented the case to the county government on the 24th to await legal proceedings.</p>

<p>I read in your newspaper's news column that the Health Bureau has decided to move the accumulated coffins in funeral parlors and coffin storage places in various districts of the city within a limited time to improve the city's environmental hygiene. I believe that this matter is indeed a task that the health authorities should undertake. However, while promoting official orders, it is also necessary to provide convenience to those moving coffins to be practical. Currently, the annual storage fees charged by various coffin storage places and funeral parlors are shockingly high. They use the excuse of the rising cost of living, but since annual fees have already been paid, if the coffin is moved out during this paid period, they extort huge "exit hall fees," sometimes exceeding or equaling the annual fee, which is difficult to understand. There must be quite a few coffin families who are hesitant to move due to economic constraints. It is advisable for the municipal authorities to promptly issue a notice strictly prohibiting the extortion of "exit hall fees" and allow people to report violations to eradicate bad practices. As for coffins transported to other locations, it is necessary to apply for a permit from the police station and find a guarantor. Although the permit fee is not high, the running around and waiting for the permit, and the humble requests, make people see it as a daunting task. In fact, if the goal is to disperse accumulated coffins, the permit application is also redundant. These are my limited opinions, and I respectfully request the municipal authorities to adopt and implement them. (Zhang Wuben)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Vegetable Market Stallholders Plead for Sympathy <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>We are stallholders from the Changyang Road Qiqihar Road small vegetable market. When the Japanese devils occupied Shanghai, the vegetable market was closed, prohibiting us from operating inside, resulting in over 300 families and over 2,000 people of all ages being displaced and unemployed, suffering from hunger and cold. Under the iron heel of the invaders, there was no light, and we could only endure. After victory, we celebrated seeing the light of day again, hoping to resume our old business to maintain our livelihoods. Who would have thought that the Maotai Foreign Company would take over, claiming that they had purchased it for use as a warehouse and prohibiting its reopening, forcing stallholders to set up in the middle of the road, causing traffic congestion, frequent disputes, and increasing danger? We have repeatedly petitioned various authorities, but without satisfactory results. At this time of howling north winds, the poor people without clothes or food, with sunken faces and emaciated bodies, are in an indescribable state! In the future, when rain and snow come, there is little hope that they will not freeze or starve to death! As the saying goes, sitting and waiting for death is worse than taking a desperate risk. Now, the stallholders, driven by the danger to their lives, have been forced to automatically dismantle the bamboo fences left by the Japanese devils at the vegetable market on the morning of the 17th of this month to seek survival for thousands of people. Although they know that it will inevitably cause interference, they cannot afford to worry about it. As expected, on the morning of the 19th, more than ten police officers suddenly arrived and arrested more than 19 stallholders. The stallholders went to the Jianlin Road branch to appeal, but without results. Now, the families of those arrested are all crying and starving all day long, a tragic sight. In addition to separately submitting petitions to relevant authorities, knowing that your newspaper is the voice of the people, we specifically request that you grant us publication, respectfully hoping that social figures and fair-minded people will uphold justice and provide assistance to save lives!

<h3 id="e59">How to Influence Petty Traitors <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>At this critical juncture, the people should clearly distinguish right from wrong, for the safety and security of China depends on it. There is a matter related to the clear differentiation of right and wrong in the current Shanghai society that I hope the government authorities will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai has become a haven for middle and lower-class collaborators from various places, or people suspected of being traitors. They either use aliases or hide their identities. Although they are not in prison, they still suffer mental punishment, have no opportunity to serve the country and society, and are despised by society. However, the pressure of life does not discriminate. Because they do not engage in production, perhaps they suffer more deeply than the people. Moreover, some of them are intellectuals, who are more sensitive to the severity of the current situation than the people. This group of people are weak-willed and without integrity. In such a turbulent environment, they are most easily seduced by heterodox ideas, which ultimately increases the chaos of the country.</p>
<p>Major traitors have either been executed or sentenced. The government should deal with the remaining group of middle and lower-class collaborators wisely, because in the nation-building phase, talent is a valuable resource. Although they are not talented, they are still slightly better than those without talent. Moreover, they did not really oppose the government in the past. If the government gives them an opportunity to reform, they would probably be eager to do good and get rid of the mental punishment.</p>
<p>My suggestion is: The government should establish repentance centers in major cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, openly hoping that they will turn themselves in, use persuasive methods to correct their thinking, and rebuild their national outlook. Depending on the depth of their indoctrination, the length of the repentance period should be adjusted accordingly. In the future, the government should assign them jobs, starting from the lowest level, and use their achievements and effectiveness to offset their past transgressions. Then, they will have a new hope for their future and will definitely be willing to work hard to serve the country, invisibly adding a group of middle and lower-level talents.</p>
<p>This is to eliminate hidden dangers before they emerge, and to transform dross into something useful. I wonder if people from all walks of life can forgive them? (Shi Lai)</p>

Chief Ruan and Yu Shaosong and others, eight in total, also travelled to Shanghai on the same train. Ruan and Yu are National Assembly representatives and came to Hangzhou for the county magistrate examination, now returning to the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Higher Examinations in Luoyang <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fan Hong</p>
<p>Because the Examination Yuan moved back to Luoyang, Luoyang unexpectedly became an examination area for the higher and ordinary examinations, adding a lot of status and color to Luoyang, and also giving those who are progressive or those who are frustrated in their careers without access a bright hope. This cannot but be regarded as good news for Luoyang, Henan, southern Shanxi, and Shaanxi. The reporter hopes that this good news can select many talents for the country in the future and create greater benefits for the local people.</p>
<p>As usual, the examinations were held simultaneously with the other ten places on October 20th. The location was the Zhougong Temple, far from the city, where the Examination Yuan is located. The examination types, registration procedures, examination methods, and examination subjects were also exactly the same as in other places. However, the number of applicants was not very enthusiastic, and it cannot be compared with other places. This is of course limited to the following reasons: (1) Inconvenient transportation, difficult roads, and applicants could not arrive on time. (2) There are not many higher education institutions in Luoyang, and there are too few students remaining in colleges and above. (3) Those who are interested in taking the examination are either unable to leave due to environmental limitations or unable to come from afar due to economic limitations. Therefore, by the deadline for registration, for the first higher examination special examination of 26 types, there were only a total of 152 applicants. On the examination day, 128 people arrived at the examination venue as scheduled. For the second Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor and Judicial Officer examinations, there were only 112 applicants, and 86 people participated in the examination. Those who failed the physical examination twice were two people in the first examination and one person in the second examination. This has already shown that this examination did not attract too much attention, and naturally did not achieve our expected hope.</p>
<p>Although the number of examinees was not large, the management was very strict. The examination papers were completely sealed, and the test questions were mimeographed. In particular, those who wrote the wax plate and printed them were locked in a secret room day and night until the test questions were distributed before they were allowed to leave the venue, so they were quite miserable. Dozens of employees of the Examination Yuan were busy for nearly a month without rest for the examination of over a hundred people, registration, making examination papers, borrowing furniture, numbering, etc. However, their compensation did not increase due to the heavy workload, nor was there any overtime pay like in general agencies. They were simply selecting true talents for the country.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the examinees, they provided accommodations and meals, solving the examinees' food and lodging difficulties. The meals were provided twice in the morning and evening, costing 700 yuan per meal, and the examinees could purchase tickets for meals with their admission tickets. The examinees all found it convenient.</p>
<p>Speaking of the examination expenses, a total of 1.2 million yuan, which made the Examination Yuan very difficult. According to their approximate allocation of expenses, the cost of examination papers was about 400,000 yuan, postage was about 400,000 yuan, furniture borrowing and transportation costs were 100,000 yuan, invigilation and examination fees were about 300,000 yuan, and other expenses were about 200,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan, which was definitely not enough for the application of the two examinations. However, the examination has already been successfully completed, and one cannot but admire the service spirit of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Regarding the Two Proposals on Troop Inspection and Disarmament: US Attempts to Reconcile British and Soviet Disputes; British Delegation Awaits New Instructions from London <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] The rift between the Soviet Union and the Western powers appeared to widen further last night, with all compromises proving ineffective. The division among the five major powers has intensified due to the Soviet Union's opposition to the restrictions proposed by the US, Britain, China, and France on the use of the veto power in the Security Council. There is also no consensus on the proposals for troop inspection and disarmament. In addition, the four foreign ministers have made no progress on the Italian and issues, with 35 outstanding issues. Last night's meeting proceeded slowly, and it was reported that Secretary of State Byrnes lamented that the foreign ministers should decide whether they want to draft peace treaties, and at the current rate, no treaty can be completed before 1950. Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union immediately replied that he was not so pessimistic.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 24th] American experts were busy all day today, trying to reconcile the British and Soviet disputes on the topic of troop inspection and disarmament. Although informal talks have been held between the delegations for 48 hours, the results will not be known until the meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly tomorrow. It is reported that if the British delegation receives new instructions from London, it will propose new suggestions to answer some of the accusations made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The instructions of the British government will not go beyond three points: First, to closely link the issue of inspection of foreign troops with disarmament; Second, to closely link the inspection of foreign troops with the inspection of domestic troops; Third, to establish a supervision or management system. No matter what instructions are given, British representative Buck will undoubtedly answer the difficulties of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the American side left tonight as a time for technical discussions in order to reconcile these two topics and draft a compromise proposal that will be jointly accepted by Britain and the Soviet Union. American experts pointed out several commonalities between these two topics, so they are working hard to link them closely. The British concern about the Soviet proposal to inspect foreign troops is not because the Soviet delegation has not formally guaranteed the request for inspection, but only for the convenience of conspiracy meetings of the United Nations. People close to the Joint Chiefs of Staff admit that the slow progress of the agency's work is due to the lack of information on the strength of the armed forces of the member states of the United Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Obstructing India's Unification and Progress: Nehru Condemns the Muslim League; Congress Party Reaffirms Adherence to Non-Violence <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Our London Correspondent, 25th] The Indian interim government has been in existence for two months, during which time the situation has been precarious, reaching a point today that is on the verge of collapse. London officials believe the crux of the problem lies in the Muslim League leader Jinnah's resolute refusal to participate in the Constituent Assembly. As the assembly convenes in the next two weeks, the constitutional issue will face a serious crisis. Official opinion is that unless Jinnah changes the Muslim League's uncooperative attitude, Governor-General Wavell will be forced to remove the five Muslim League ministers from the interim government. If Jinnah refuses to guarantee that the five Muslim League ministers will attend the Constituent Assembly scheduled for December 9th, there will be no solution other than for the Indian Governor to act with full authority.</p>
<p>[Reuter's, Meerut, 24th] The Vice-President of the Indian interim government, Nehru, stated to representatives of the Indian states at the close of the Congress Party conference today that although some states are still hesitant about the Indian Constituent Assembly, the Congress Party will make full use of this assembly to make India a republic. Nehru then condemned the Muslim League's "fascist methods" and its attitude of hatred towards the Congress Party, saying that such policies have produced another Hindu fascism, with both factions using religion as a pretext, but both being enemies of India's unification and progress.</p>
<p>[Reuter's, Meerut, 25th] The Chairman of the Congress Party, Kripalani, today reaffirmed the Congress Party's determination to adhere to Gandhi's non-violent principles. He pointed out that India has too many factions, and if violence is used against foreign countries, it will ultimately be used against each other. The world is in a state of bloodshed and turmoil, and there will never be peace, he said.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Meerut, 24th] The newly appointed Chairman of the Congress Party, Kripalani, stated in his speech at the 54th Congress Party conference that the sincere relationship between China and India should be further strengthened, and transportation between the two countries should be improved. While we must develop and maintain equal and friendly relations with our allies, our neighbors in Asia, Australia should also be closer to us. We have a long history and cultural connection with China. Today, we still maintain a sincere relationship with China. This is the achievement of our competent Foreign Minister Nehru, and we should thank him for it. However, we are so far apart from our neighbors that we cannot directly receive telegrams from China here. Chinese telegrams must be forwarded through London, which always takes more than 24 hours. This urgently needs improvement.</p>

<p>Iranian Army Ordered to Go to Supervise Elections</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 25th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh declared martial law in Renjen, the city recently occupied, to prevent the rumored "terrorist acts" of Azerbaijan, and ordered the central army to enter Azerbaijan Province to monitor the elections to be held there on December 7th. Renjen is located forty miles south of the Azerbaijan border, and is the northernmost point conquered by government troops since the Azerbaijan rebellion last year. According to news received today, fighting has occurred in the city, and Azerbaijan reinforcements are heading south. The Iranian King met with Prime Minister Sultaneh and the Commander of the Army, advocating the continued implementation of a "iron-fisted policy" towards the semi-autonomous government of Azerbaijan Province.</p>
<p>[Reuter's, Tehran, 24th] The Tabriz radio station broadcast an urgent appeal for help last night, saying that 5,000 armed men had entered the city of Renjen, killing 20 people, surrounding government offices, and attacking a police station and members of the government party. It is said that after the government troops entered the city of Renjen, they took retaliatory actions against the local residents.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh told the Governor of Azerbaijan Province, Javid, that his statement issued on Thursday, declaring that troops and police will be sent to all parts of the country to maintain peace and order during the election of members of parliament, also includes Azerbaijan Province. Therefore, the election in Azerbaijan will also be controlled by the supervisors and troops sent by the government.</p>

<p>Citizens' Referendum Shows Overwhelming Support</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 25th] The US military government announced today that the referendum held on Sunday regarding whether Germans agree with the initial democratic constitution of the Hutenberg-Baden Province in the US occupation zone of Germany resulted in 1.25 million Germans (approximately 70% of all eligible voters) casting an overwhelming majority of "yes" votes. After official approval of the results of this vote, the newly formed legislative assembly will take over the government and elect a speaker within sixteen days. At that time, the US military government will transfer its governing power to the Germans and act as a supervisor. However, if the Germans fail to eliminate the Nazis, the US military government will continue to control the right to reparations and the elimination of Nazism. Similar elections will be held next Sunday in Bavaria and Greater Hesse, in which 5 million Germans will participate in the vote. After the constitutional referendum is passed, German officials are preparing to hang the red, black, and yellow national flag, which is the first time since the war.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Brussels, 24th] Municipal council elections were held in Belgium today, and women will participate in the voting, which is the first time since the liberation of Belgium. The Catholic Party, which supports the exiled King Leopold, hopes to gain women's support and increase its strength. In the parliamentary elections this year, women did not have the right to vote, and although the Catholic Party won the majority of votes among all parties, it was not enough to overwhelm the government formed by various parties. As a result, the left-wing party formed a coalition government.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] Judging from the current situation, in the second election in France, the Communist Party seems to have surpassed President Bidault's Popular Republican Movement. However, the number of votes obtained by the two parties is very close, or it may still be the Popular Republican Movement that wins when the final statistics are announced. This time, 83,751 candidates from various parties were elected, and those elected will be re-elected to the Upper House of the National Assembly, that is, the members of the Republican Council, in two weeks. The recent statistics on the number of candidates elected by various parties are as follows: Communist Party 24,721, Popular Republican Movement 24,446, Socialist Party 14,280, Radical Socialist Party 8,381, Right-wing Group 11,742.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Yesterday's election of senators in mainland France and Corsica resulted in the Communist Party still dominating. The Ministry of Interior announced the number of seats obtained by various parties as follows: Communist Party 24,291, Popular Republican Movement 24,151, Socialist Party 14,393, Radical Socialist Party 8,089.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] After the French Communist Party won the first round of the Senate elections, it again demanded to obtain the position of Prime Minister in the new government. Bond, one of the leaders of the Communist Party, told reporters that the Communist Party received 500,000 more votes than the Popular Republican Movement in this election, ranking first among all parties. There is no doubt that the French people support the Communist Party more than any other political party. The people have clearly expressed their willingness to form a democratic coalition government, with the most qualified representative of the largest party in the National Assembly serving as Prime Minister. Gaillard, the leader of the Popular Republican Movement, also expressed satisfaction with the election results, saying that the Popular Republican Movement is constantly progressing.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Tracking Station Between Australia and South Africa; Preparing to Test Rockets <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Sydney, 24th] Britain is now developing a rocket test range that passes through the barren lands of western Australia and over the Indian Ocean. Finally, unmanned aircraft will travel at supersonic speeds on the world's longest range. According to people close to the Australian government, radar equipment will be installed at various observation stations along the desert line to track the rocket's whereabouts. The initial goal is to develop and test rocket boosters, but radio-controlled flight and landing will occupy an important part of the test. The launch site is probably Ankara, west of the border between Australia and South Africa. The 200-mile-wide range will extend northwest to the airspace above Christmas Island. The first section of the range is 300 miles long, and the total length will reach 3,000 miles. There is no sign when the range will be used, but preliminary actions have already begun before the Australian government approves it.</p>

<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Washington, 25th] The Army Department is preparing to fight for the move by the Republican Congress to cut defense spending. According to well-informed sources, the Army Department will warn Congress that abruptly reducing defense spending in this turbulent world situation may cause serious consequences.

<h3 id="e75">US Federal Court Summoned Lewis Yesterday; Wartime Laws Not Lifted, Strikes Violate Prohibitions <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Reuter's, Washington, 25th] The Federal Court convened today. The number of reporters listening to the trial of Lewis, the leader of 400,000 bituminous coal miners, was unprecedented since the kidnapping case of the White toddler. Lewis presented reasons today explaining why he should not be punished even though he did not comply with the court order to withdraw the notice terminating the contract between the miners and the government. If Lewis cannot provide satisfactory answers to this, Judge Goldsborough will formally try him with a jury on Wednesday or an earlier date. Today's hearing marks the beginning of a long legal battle, and the lawsuit may reach the former Supreme Court. The Washington Post reported yesterday that the government plans to ask the court to fine the miners' union $200,000 a day and sentence Lewis to imprisonment. The 60-year-old Lewis will invoke a 20-year-old law to prove that the government has no right to forcibly prohibit strikes. The coal mine strike has been going on for five days, and the government has appealed to the governors of various states to conserve coal. Director Steel of the Civilian Production Administration also called on the people to cooperate yesterday.</p>
<p>Widespread Industrial Shutdown</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The bituminous coal strike entered a critical week today, which could cause a widespread shutdown of national industries. The government hopes that when the court summons the chairman of the Miners' Union, Lewis, on the 25th, it can make him yield. If Federal Judge Goldsborough finds Lewis and his union guilty of contempt of court, he will severely punish the union and lightly punish Lewis, without sentencing him to imprisonment. If Lewis goes to jail, it will fulfill his wish and create a bad impression on public psychology. Except for waiting for the court hearing tomorrow, everything is temporarily suspended, and agencies have stopped working. Coal-burning railway passenger transport has been reduced by a quarter and will be implemented from midnight today. The emergency power conservation campaign in 21 states will begin tomorrow night.</p>
<p>State of War Not Over</p>
<p>[Reuter's, Washington, 25th] The United States is still in a state of war today. The fact is that the US President and Congress have not formally announced the end of the war, and many wartime emergency powers are still in effect. The formal announcement of the end of the war this time may not be faster than after the last war. The main purpose of maintaining this legal state of war is to maintain certain wartime emergency decrees. The revocation of the price control law this time may be a prelude to the termination of other emergency decrees. However, the outbreak of the coal mine strike has allowed another emergency decree to take effect, namely the order prohibiting strikes. The reason why the chairman of the Miners' Union, Lewis, is considered to have violated the law is based on this. The transition from a wartime state to a peacetime state requires careful handling. A sudden termination of wartime powers can easily lead to abnormal situations. Today, the maintenance of overseas troops, the reorganization of the army and navy, the continuation of counter-espionage work, and the control of experts are still affected by 300 to 400 kinds of wartime emergency measures.</p>
<p>[Reuter's, New York, 24th] Since the US government called for emergency austerity measures to deal with the situation caused by the coal mine strike, the acting Governor of New York State, Hanley, has declared a state of emergency.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese provisional parliament convened today, but the labor unrest is spreading across the country and has not subsided slightly. In addition, the recent expansion of the scope of the purge has caused deep anxiety in political, economic, and public opinion circles. The government's measures are not sufficient to satisfy public expectations. There seems to be a subtle shadow in Japanese political circles. During this session of parliament, the dissolution of parliament may occur. The current government is not prepared to submit important amendment bills such as the House of Representatives election law, the labor adjustment law, the labor standards law, and the wage standards law. If the Socialist Party firmly demands that the government submit them, the parliament will fall into chaos, and the government's position will inevitably be shaken. The bills prepared by the government are the "Imperial Household Code Amendment" bill, the Imperial Household Economic Law bill, the Cabinet Law bill, the National Assembly Law bill, and the Court Law bill.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] With the provisional parliament already convened, the Japanese Socialist Party convened a general meeting of Socialist Party members today to discuss attitudes and countermeasures, and elected Mizutani Chozaburo as the chairman of the "Parliamentary Countermeasures" committee. Mizutani then said that the Socialist Party will take a purely opposition stance towards this provisional parliament, severely criticizing the government's fragility and incompetence, and demanding the dissolution of parliament.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bethune, France, 24th] A horrific tragedy was discovered here this morning. Nine bodies were hoisted from a nearby canal, tied together with ropes. The deceased were the miner Dumortier and his wife, their four sons and three daughters. The clues to the tragedy were discovered last night, when two pairs of pants and a headband were found on the shore, presumably belonging to the children who drowned. The oldest was 15 years old, and the youngest was two years old. The reason for the suicide is said to be that the court decided to remove five of the miner's children to be raised by a public orphanage, because the miner was a weak-willed drunkard who could not educate his children. However, the miner was stubborn and said that he would rather kill all seven children than have five of them taken away.</p>

<p>We Indians, like any other people in the world, have inalienable "human rights." Since the outbreak of World War II, our two million Indian compatriots have also fought for the same goals. Thousands of Indians sacrificed their lives in North Africa and elsewhere for the war effort. However, this sacrifice, at least in South Africa, has been completely in vain. Eighty-six years ago, Indians came to South Africa as invited immigrants. I was born in South Africa, and my ancestors migrated three generations ago. Yet, we are nominally considered citizens of South Africa.  Indian compatriots who came to South Africa were very hardworking and able to endure hardship. They toiled in coal mines, on railways, and in sugarcane plantations. They created the current prosperity of South Africa with their sweat and blood. They settled in South Africa for its wealth and became natives.  They also enjoyed national and local voting rights. No one hindered their progress, and the people of South Africa considered them good citizens. But—in recent years, we have witnessed the status of the Indian people in South Africa being snatched away.  New laws are passed every year to undermine our freedom. Our national and local voting rights have been deprived. Laws restricting our business rights have also been passed.  On trains and buses, we must sit separately; in parks, there are designated seats for us; post offices have separate counters for us; in national government, local government, and courts, we can only sit in separate seats. Up until now, there have been sixty laws specifically designed to restrict our freedom of movement and hinder our economic and social development. Now, things are getting worse. Two laws have been enacted that are extremely damaging to Indians: the Asiatic Land Tenure Act and the Indian Representation Act of 1946. These two laws fundamentally exclude Indians from South African society and deprive us of our freehold and property rights. Gandhi and Nehru have vociferously protested these laws, and China has also lodged a protest. George Bernard Shaw said: "The Union of South Africa is decadent and snobbish. Because they cannot keep up with the intelligence and shrewdness of the Indians, they persecute the Indian people with whips. The laws they have enacted are no different from the methods used by the Germans to persecute the Jews!" The newly enacted laws are not only humiliating to the Indian people but are already harming them. Two million European immigrants occupy 150 seats in Parliament, while 250,000 Indians only have the right to elect three representatives, who must still sit in separate seats. Recently, they simply enacted a law to abolish these few representatives, and even these three representatives have been replaced by Europeans. This is the third-class citizenship that South Africa gives us. In September, at the United Nations General Assembly, South Africa unreasonably explained India's grievances by saying: "This is entirely an internal matter of South Africa, and the South African government's policies towards its citizens do not require the intervention of the United Nations." Isn't this the same excuse that Hitler used to justify the persecution of the Jews? India deeply resents South Africa's mistreatment of their descendants and has now cut off trade with South Africa through its highest officials, imposing economic sanctions. Although our ancestors were of Indian ethnicity, we have been deeply influenced by Western civilization. If we have sufficient opportunity, we will take on national responsibilities. South Africa is our home! South Africa is where we were born. Since we are nurtured by her land, we ask for the same opportunity to develop her! To deal with the abuse, the old methods used by Gandhi in South Africa thirty-five years ago to combat anti-Indian laws have been adopted by us. Now, the Indian people of South Africa are using passive resistance to fight against the government. In protest against the newly enacted land law, hundreds of Indian men and women continue to sit on vacant land belonging to the city government, which is legally forbidden to Indians. The South African government takes these Indians away and locks them up every day. Now, the prisons hold more than 430 people who have been sentenced to hard labor. The South African government must provide an answer to the condemnation of world opinion. Democracy cannot exclude the Indians of South Africa, democracy should be for all the people of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Customs Releases Trade Statistics: Last Month's Import-Export Ratio Was Twelve to One <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs: Last month, China's foreign trade saw imports totaling 202.700645 billion Legal Tender (法幣), while exports totaled 17.587172 billion Legal Tender.  Although the value of imports decreased by 19.905525 billion Legal Tender compared to September's total of 222.600617 billion Legal Tender, the value of exports decreased by 35.932991 billion Legal Tender compared to September's total of 53.520163 billion Legal Tender. In other words, the ratio of import value to export value last month was approximately twelve to one, and the ratio of last month's export value to September's was one to three. It is understood that the slight decrease in imports compared to September is due to the effect of the government's implementation of the new exchange rate on August 19th. The sluggishness of exports, besides the high domestic prices and weak production, other factors such as the U.S. maritime worker strike also greatly affected the shipment of our country's goods according to the established schedule. As for last month's imports, raw cotton still accounted for the largest portion (same as in September), followed by ships, then wool, and then chemical products and books/paper.  Among exports, oils and fats ranked first (same as in September), followed by pig bristles, then tea, and leather in fourth place.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Fire Prevention Propaganda Day: A Convoy of Fire Trucks Slowly Moves Through the City Center; Fire Department Hosts Reporters to Tour Facilities <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] To raise public awareness of fire hazards and prevent them from occurring, the Police Department's Fire Department has launched a Fire Prevention Campaign Week to universally instill fire prevention knowledge among citizens. Yesterday was the first day of the campaign. Starting at 9:30 AM, a parade of fire vehicles was held. Participating units included 17 types of fire trucks from nine fire districts, including Central, Hongkou, Xinzha, Jing'an, Yangshupu, Yichang Road, Taishan Road, and Wuxing Road, totaling 40 vehicles. The parade was under the overall command of Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Fire Department, with Ye Binyong, Chief of the Second Division, as his deputy. The procession started from the intersection of Yu Garden Road and Dihua Road, led by a blue banner with the words "Fire Prevention Campaign Week," followed by a military band, giant oil paintings, slogans, etc.  Along the way, loudspeakers broadcast messages to the public, and passersby stopped to watch.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Fire Department hosted a press conference at the department's conference room at 280 Henan Road. Those in attendance numbered over a hundred people, including Police Chief Xuan Tiewu, Deputy Chief Yu Shuping, Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Chief Captain Xia Guoliang, Chief of the Second Division Ye Binyong, and reporters from various newspapers. The conference was chaired by Chief Xuan, who gave a three-point statement:</p>
<p>Using Spirit to Compensate for Material Deficiencies</p>
<p>(1) The reason why fires in Shanghai have been so serious lately is due to the increased population after the war. Before 1937, the total population of Shanghai was only over three million, but now it has increased to over four million. The residential areas in Nanshi and Zhabei have been largely destroyed, so the housing problem is extremely crowded. Stoves are set up everywhere on roads and in alleys, making ignition very easy. In addition, people do not pay attention to fire prevention; a small spark can lead to a major disaster. Recalling the era of the former foreign concessions, foreigners paid great attention to fire prevention, establishing a fire department and attaching great importance to it. Their expenditures were always above 5%, while now it is only 1%. Therefore, the fire department has been shouldering an excessive responsibility for more than a year, using the "spirit" of the people to compensate for material deficiencies, so that no major disasters have occurred in the city for more than a year.</p>
<p>Renovating Equipment and Rectifying Discipline</p>
<p>(2) The current equipment and vehicles used by the fire department were taken over from the puppet government era, and the puppet government took them over from the former Municipal Council period, so most of them are already fifty years old. If they were abroad, they would have been renovated long ago. Because the fire-fighting equipment is too old, defects such as holes in the hoses can reduce the efficiency of the work. Revision and supplementation are urgently needed, but this is difficult to achieve at present due to economic constraints.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the discipline of firefighters, rumors arose and malpractices abounded in the former concession era, such as firefighters demanding prices before putting out fires. Since I took over, although I dare not guarantee that every firefighter can be clean and self-disciplined, I can at least guarantee that they dare not openly take advantage of people's misfortune with the intention of extortion; otherwise, citizens are allowed to report the facts, and I will punish them severely.</p>
<p>Public Exhibition of Firefighting Equipment</p>
<p>Finally, Chief Xuan said that the fire department has two tasks——"extinguishing" and "prevention." "Extinguishing" is actively putting out a fire after it has broken out. "Prevention" is taking effective precautions before a fire occurs.</p>
<p>After Chief Xuan finished speaking, Chief Ye Binyong and District Captain Xu Liren led the reporters to visit the third floor, where various state-of-the-art firefighting equipment were on public display, along with the most ideal architectural models of theaters and warehouses. At around 5:00 PM, a film entitled "The Chemistry of Fire" was shown. The film was produced by the Asia Petroleum Company and was divided into several segments such as "Where Does Fire Come From?" and "How to Prevent Fire?" The film was about twenty minutes long, and the reception ended around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Last night at 7:00 PM, Mayor Wu also gave a speech on the meaning and knowledge of fire prevention on the police radio station. During this week, all movie theaters will show fire prevention slides before the films, fire prevention slogans will be posted on all streets, and all scheduled programs will be carried out separately as decided.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Fuxing Island Fisheries Administration's Scope Expanding; Owns Latest American Fishing Vessels, Fears No Wind or Waves; 570,000 Pounds of Fresh Fish Caught in Two Months <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Fuxing Island Fisheries Administration, jointly operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), has seen its scope of work expand since its establishment. Recently, it began utilizing CRRRA materials to build 10,000 wooden boats, which will be used to supply Chinese fishermen in the future.</p>
<p>The Administration currently has 34 of the latest American fishing vessels. By the end of this year, 16 more will be added, and more will continue to come to China in the future. These fishing vessels were built in 1944 by the California shipbuilding company in Coleburg. They are equipped with the latest type of echo sounders and radio telephones, which can be used to direct the vessels in the sea and communicate with other vessels regardless of distance. Most of the fishing vessels have a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour, a fishing capacity of 135 tons, an engine power of 400 horsepower per hour, a gasoline capacity of 6,000 gallons, and a water capacity of 1,500 gallons. Each voyage does not require refueling or water and can travel directly for 2,000 nautical miles. The fishing nets are 114 feet long and 120 feet wide. These fishing vessels are safe in the ocean even in the event of strong winds and waves. When coming to China from the United States, each vessel is assigned five to seven American fishing crew members. Their compensation is paid by the Fisheries Administration, and each crew member's service contract is for six months. Their main task is to train Chinese fishery personnel in the use of new machinery. Currently, there are over 100 foreign personnel. The fish caught during the trial period of these vessels are sold at low prices in the fish market, and the proceeds are used to fund the Fisheries Administration. The amount of fish caught is extremely surprising. From September 11th to October 31st, 17 vessels were dispatched, catching 197,259.5 pounds of fish. From November 1st to the 14th, only 12 vessels were dispatched, catching 374,574 pounds of fish. The Fisheries Administration has also established a reception center on Fuxing Island, headed by Li Zongdao. The reception center is fully equipped and can accommodate 200 people. It will be expanded in the future.</p>

<p>Nineteen Detained for Observation, One Already Has a Fever</p>
<p>Recently, smallpox has been prevalent in Hong Kong, with a particularly high mortality rate. According to a telegram from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Quarantine Station, from October 10th to 20th, 217 smallpox cases have been discovered in Hong Kong, resulting in 137 deaths, a mortality rate of 63%. Yesterday afternoon, the Yong Sheng Wheel, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai, brought 388 passengers. The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station discovered that 19 passengers, including domestic and foreign individuals, did not carry vaccination certificates. All were detained for observation and were vaccinated. One passenger already had a fever, and it could not be determined what disease they had. They were sent to the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital for isolation and treatment by the Quarantine Station. The Yong Sheng Wheel must wait until the passenger's diagnosis is confirmed before it can determine its next steps. The patient is named Chen Zhentang, male, 38 years old, from Wuchuan, Guangdong, and is a civil servant. The attending physician is currently engaged in various diagnostic work, and confirmation is still pending. The Health Bureau has ordered all health offices and hospitals/clinics to step up vaccinations.</p>

<p>Mr. Du Weixin, the fourth son of Shanghai social leader Du Yuesheng, recently returned from studying in the United States. Yesterday noon, he was formally engaged to Miss Dorothy, a member of the New York banking community, at the Du residence in Shanghai.  Du did not want to be extravagant about this Sino-American marriage, and very few people outside knew about it. Only a few dozen relatives and friends, such as Qian Xinzhi, were invited to witness the ceremony. The ceremony was extremely simple. The officiant exchanged Chinese and English marriage vows, and the atmosphere was very joyful. It was temporarily circulated as a good story.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Gruesome Case of Dismembered Body in a Box; Head Found at Yokohama Bridge, Body at Wuhua Road; Thirteen Knife Wounds to the Head, Ears and Nose Cut Off, Right Eye Wounded About an Inch, Legs Cut into Four Pieces <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 8:00 AM yesterday, another bizarre case of a body in a box occurred in the city. The location was in a small bay near Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road. At the time, a passerby saw a medium-sized brown leather travel bag left on the beach and approached it to investigate. He found bloodstains on the box, and half of the bag was submerged in the water. He immediately reported it to the nearby police officer, who relayed it to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. The station dispatched Judicial Section Chief Zhou Nan and police officer Zhang Decai to investigate. They retrieved the box and opened it. Inside, there was oil paper, and inside the oil paper, there was a rectangular object wrapped in a gray military blanket. After opening it, they shockingly found a male head and two legs and two feet that had been dismembered, a bloody and unbearable sight. They immediately telegraphed the Criminal Investigation Division of the General Police Station and photographed the body box for the record. Before long, police officers from the No. 12499 Security Team of the Hongzhen police substation of the Ti Lan Qiao Police Station, while passing through the wasteland at the intersection of Wuhua Road and Tianbao Road, also discovered a section of a headless and footless male corpse wrapped in a bed sheet. They immediately reported it to the substation. Station Chief Zhang immediately ordered Judicial Section Chief Ma to rush to investigate and telegraphed the General Police Station for the record. When the Yokohama Bridge box with the body parts was discovered, the General Police Station, after receiving the report, immediately ordered the two bodies to be moved to the Ti Lan Qiao substation. At 11:00 AM, the General Police Station dispatched personnel to examine the bodies. The head and body matched, and the skin color was the same. The deceased was forty years old, had hair, and had a total of thirteen knife wounds to the head. The left ear and nose had been cut off, and there was a one-inch deep knife wound to the right eye. The fatal wound was on the head, presumably the victim was first stabbed to death by the murderer while sleeping, and then dismembered. The legs were cut into four sections, and one leg had two black marks. The body was wearing a white cotton undershirt and a pajama top, and looked like a businessman. After the examination, the body was transported to the autopsy center on Changde Road. As of late last night, the police station was still conducting a strict investigation.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Council needed to find a new meeting place because the former Japanese Association's original site on Dith Avenue would only be received via transfer after the US military's agreed deadline, February 14th, next year. The Council had repeatedly contacted and inspected meeting places everywhere, but none were suitable. Yesterday, Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan accompanied Secretary-General Xiang Changquan to inspect the auditorium of Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road. It was quite suitable for meetings. After contacting the school, it was decided that the second Municipal Council meeting would be held at the school, and Zhengshi Middle School agreed to lend it free of charge. The Municipal Council Secretariat is responsible for all arrangements. The issue of the meeting place for the second meeting has finally been resolved, but the meeting date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Resolving the Surplus Materials Entanglement; Lida Trading Proposes a Suggestion; Sell All Remaining Pharmaceuticals Back to the US at Original Price; Three US Implementing Agencies Discuss Methods <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Among the surplus pharmaceutical materials sold by the US Materials Clearance Committee to Lida International Trading Company, following blood plasma, the US also intended to retrieve anesthetics, surgical instruments, and other items. The merchants felt extremely troubled by this, and the details have been reported in previous issues. It is now known that Lida Trading Company (in fact, Chengxin Trading Company, because Lida has already transferred ownership of the batch of pharmaceuticals) has formally suggested to the Materials Clearance Committee to sell all the remaining pharmaceuticals, including blood plasma, back to the US at the original purchase price plus the loading, unloading, warehousing, and other fees paid by the company, in order to avoid future troubles and seek a thorough resolution. Yesterday morning, Mr. Fang Fushu, a lawyer representing the company, contacted Mr. Davis of the Materials Clearance Committee by telephone and then expressed this suggestion in a formal letter. In the afternoon, the US Materials Clearance Committee and the three implementing agencies of the US Navy and Marine Corps held a meeting to discuss how to compensate for the price of blood plasma, retrieve the anesthetics, or accept Lida Trading's suggestion to buy back all the pharmaceuticals with cash for the whole discussion. The meeting had not finished by evening. It is expected that a decision will be made today on which method to adopt.</p>
<p>The original purchase price of all the pharmaceuticals was US$1.65 million. Among them, there were over 39,000 units of blood plasma, which would be worth US$975,000 if calculated at the market price of US$25 per unit. However, when the two parties initially negotiated, Lida requested that the US pay only US$520,000 for the blood plasma.</p>

<p>Four Hundred Stores on Nanjing Road to Discuss Petitioning Methods This Afternoon</p>
<p>Over four hundred businesses on Nanjing Road believe that the deposit interest income tax and employee salary tax levied by the Direct Tax Bureau are unbearable for shop owners and employees. They plan to petition the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau to request reductions or exemptions.

Yesterday, a reporter visited the Direct Tax Bureau to inquire about the bureau's attitude towards this matter. It was stated that all taxes stipulated by the state are very reasonable, and paying taxes is the duty of the people. If all taxes were reduced or exempted, how would the state's finances be maintained? Therefore, they intend to guide and consult with the merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Fook Kee Construction Factory Concealment of Enemy Property Case - Zhang Ganquan, Chi and Others Suspected of Corruption, Handled Concurrently by the District Procuratorate <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Fook Kee Construction Factory concealing enemy property, which President Song instructed the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer to the Shanghai District Procuratorate for investigation, has been handled by Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao since the end of last month. It has been almost a month, but due to the complexity of the case, it is difficult to conclude the investigation in a short time, and further collection of materials is needed. Sun Qinchi, Shen Zhenjia, Shen Wenyuan, Guo Dasheng, and other four people from the former General Affairs Office of the Municipal Government are implicated in the case, suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. They were impeached by Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy Cheng Zhonghang and transferred to the Jiangsu Higher Court for handling by the Disciplinary Committee. Because the two cases are inseparable, they are being handled concurrently by the Shanghai District Procuratorate. At the same time, the District Procuratorate is preparing to review the files related to the case from the Supervisory Envoy's office for reference. Yesterday, Prosecutor Gu again summoned Zhou Fushan, the factory owner, Chen Shaoting, the original informant, and Zhang Ganquan, a hardware merchant suspected of purchasing enemy property, for questioning. Because Zhang's crime is more serious, he was ordered to provide a written guarantee of 20 million yuan. Zhou retained the original guarantee, while Chen was ordered to leave after being admonished.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Organizing a Syndicate to Build Housing for Public School and Government Employees - Base Sites Are Being Negotiated, and Material Shortages Are Not a Concern - The Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau Has Full Confidence <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from this newspaper] The Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau recently drafted a "Measures for Subsidizing the Construction of Housing for Public and Education Personnel" to solve the housing problem for public and education personnel, and it has been approved by the Four Joint Offices. Amid the housing shortage, this is undoubtedly good news for public and education personnel!</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau, this subsidy-based house building plan is planned to be piloted in Nanjing and Shanghai, with a total amount of 20 billion yuan. Currently, efforts are being made to promote the organization of a subsidy syndicate to raise funds. At the same time, preparations are being made for building materials and base sites required for house construction.</p>
<p>According to the draft of this plan, houses are divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. The prices are also divided into five types: 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, 35 million, and 40 million yuan (including the base price). The total subsidy amount of 20 billion yuan is expected to build nearly a thousand houses of various sizes. It is said that after all the plans are arranged, construction can begin in February next year, and it is estimated that it can be completed in four months.</p>
<p>Before construction begins, the China Trust Bureau will publicly announce reservations in newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. Reservation applicants are limited to public and education personnel serving in government agencies, schools, cultural, and educational organizations. When making a reservation, 30% of the house price (including the base price) must be paid in advance. The remaining 70% will be charged interest at a monthly rate of 2.5%, and will be amortized equally over 12 months from the date the house is completed and occupied. As an example: taking an E-type house worth 10 million yuan (including the base price), 30% of the construction cost, which is 3 million yuan, must be paid in advance when making a reservation. The remaining 7 million yuan will be charged interest at a monthly rate of 2.5%, and will be amortized equally over 12 months from the date of occupancy. This is no more than approximately 600,000 yuan per month. After the one-year period expires and the construction cost is paid off, the China Trust Bureau will hand over the land ownership certificate to you, and you will be your own landlord and house owner, which is a permanent solution!</p>
<p>Four Ideal Locations</p>
<p>Perhaps readers are eager to know the location, layout, style, and equipment of these houses. Therefore, the reporter extracted a summary from the draft and reported it separately as follows:</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the base sites for the houses are currently being purchased by the China Trust Bureau from the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries. The total area of this batch of enemy and puppet properties is 300 mu, scattered in ten locations, including:</p>
<p>No. 63, Jiangwan Road Flower Garden - 14.523 mu</p>
<p>North Fourth Avenue (near Jiangwan Road) - 9.219 mu</p>
<p>Shanyin Road, Sida Road - 29.048 mu</p>
<p>Zhoujiazui Road - 23.196 mu</p>
<p>Haig Road, Lilac Garden - 14.523 mu</p>
<p>No. 1423, Xinzha Road - 6.373 mu</p>
<p>No. 648, East Sports Club Road - 32.674 mu</p>
<p>No. 490, Huanyang Road - 5.328 mu</p>
<p>Intersection of Pushi Road and Haig Road - 6.192 mu</p>
<p>No. 100, Hongqiao Road - 140.000 mu</p>
<p>Among the above ten base sites, the China Trust Bureau believes that the first four listed are ideal in terms of location suitability and transportation convenience. These houses for public and education personnel will be built on these four base sites first. The China Trust Bureau has submitted the official business of purchasing this batch of enemy and puppet properties to the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Industries. It will be processed as soon as the Bureau of Enemy Properties receives the approval from the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Five Different Styles</p>
<p>The layout, size, building materials, and number of rooms vary for the five types of houses. They are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Type A is further divided into types A and B, but the building materials are the same: cement plaster exterior walls, reinforced concrete flat roof, foreign pine flooring, Liu'an plywood interior doors, and steel windows.</p>
<p>Type A is a single-bay three-story Western-style house, with a base area of 1,370 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has a large bedroom, a small bedroom, and a bathroom. The third floor also has a large and small bedroom, and a flat roof area. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 40 million yuan.</p>
<p>Type B is a double-bay three-story apartment, with a base area of 3,000 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a dining room, a study room, a preparation room, and a kitchen. The second and third floors each have two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 110 million yuan. The price is relatively high, but each floor can form a separate unit and be sold separately.</p>
<p>The building materials for types B and C are cement plaster exterior walls, red tile roofs, fir flooring, secondary wood interior doors, and foreign pine windows.</p>
<p>Type B is a one-and-a-half-bay two-story house, with a base area of 1,050 square feet. The ground floor has a dining room with an attached living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has three bedrooms of different sizes and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 35 million yuan.</p>
<p>Type C is a single-bay two-story house, with a base area of 782 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a servant's room. The second floor has two bedrooms of different sizes and a bathroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>The building materials for types D and E are lime plaster exterior walls, red tile roofs, reinforced concrete and fir flooring, and fir doors and windows.</p>
<p>Type D is a single-bay two-story house, with a base area of 700 square feet. The ground floor has a living room and a kitchen. The second floor has a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small room. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Type E is a single-bay pseudo-two-story house, with a base area of 384 square feet. The ground floor has a living room, a kitchen, and a toilet. The second floor has one large bedroom. The construction cost of this type of house, including the base, is estimated at 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Profits are Equal to Zero</p>
<p>The reporter saw that the "profit" column of the construction cost sheet for this batch of houses was marked with a zero. This indicates that the China Trust Bureau did not include any profits when constructing this batch of houses and was purely "aiming" to serve public and education personnel. The estimated construction costs were compiled a month ago. Now that time has passed, these estimates may have changed somewhat. However, the person in charge of the Real Estate Department of the China Trust Bureau is fully confident in the construction of this batch of houses. He said: If general financial institutions feel that the interest rate on the 20 billion yuan construction subsidy is too low and are not interested in participating in the syndicate, the China Trust Bureau has decided to provide the subsidy independently, so funding is not expected to be a problem. As for building materials, the China Trust Bureau has brick and tile kilns that received enemy property and can produce bricks and tiles in large quantities. The China Trust Bureau also has a sufficient supply of other materials such as wood, steel, cement, and sanitary ware. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a shortage of building materials. Now, all that remains is to negotiate the purchase of this batch of enemy and puppet properties. Once the purchase is completed, planning for the construction of the new houses can begin.</p>
<p>Public and education personnel, patiently wait for your new houses!</p>

<h3 id="e109">Grain and Goods Case - Truth Will Come Out - Wang Daren and Eight Others - Indicted by the District Procuratorate - Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian Not Prosecuted <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The grain and goods fraud case, which shook the whole country and attracted the attention of all parties, and which involves nearly half of the personnel, has been concluded by the District Court Procuratorate. Of the ten defendants, eight, including Wang Daren, have been indicted. Two people have not been prosecuted: Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Department, and Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Tax Department of the Grain Department. Prosecutor Wu Qihua has successively completed the indictments and non-prosecution decisions, and after they are printed, they will be sent to the defendants who are in custody or have posted bail. The entire case will then be transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court. It is said that the District Court may adopt a joint trial to hear the case, in accordance with the Court Organization Law. The original text of the non-prosecution decision No. 3881 of the Shanghai District Court for the year 35 is copied below:</p>
<p>Defendant Yang Xizhi, male, 37 years old, from Chongqing, residing at No. 26, Lane 622, Linsen Middle Road, working as the Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner of the Grain Department. Li Chongnian, male, 41 years old, from Huaiyin, residing at No. 50, Guba Road, working as the Director of the Field Tax Department of the Grain Department, Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee.</p>
<p>In the case of the above-mentioned defendants being suspected of corruption (Case No. 2443 of the 35th year of the investigation application), after the investigation by this prosecutor, it is considered that non-prosecution should be applied. The reasons are stated as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Zhixi</p>
<p>Defendant Yang Xizhi, in February of this year, because the former Mayor of Shanghai, Qian Dajun, convened a meeting of heads of various agencies in the Municipal Government. They all believed that the grain merchants had been destroyed by the enemy puppets and their organizations had been unsound and their funds limited for many years. The population of Shanghai was dense, and the grain consumption depended entirely on transportation from various places. After unanimous agreement at the meeting, they suggested that the government should provide grain loans to enrich the people's food supply. The defendant then forwarded the opinions of the heads of the various agencies to the Grain Department. However, whether the government agreed to provide the loan and how to do so was not something that the defendant could decide. Moreover, when President Song of the Executive Yuan came to Shanghai in early March, he instructed him to go to the United States for another mission. The defendant flew to Chongqing on March 7 to report to the Grain Department, returned to Shanghai on March 10, and flew to the United States on a US military plane at 9:00 AM on March 14. At that time, the government had not approved the grain loan method. External reports said that the decision to provide the grain loan and various uses were all planned by the defendant before going abroad, which is not consistent with the facts. In addition, there is no other evidence to prove that he committed a crime, and it is difficult to hold him responsible for corruption.</p>
<p>Li Chongnian</p>
<p>When the grain loan method was implemented, defendant Li Chongnian accompanied Xu Kan, the Minister of Grain, to Shanghai to assist in revising the clauses of the loan method and introduced Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu to participate in the loan undertaking. Defendant admitted to this. However, the grain loan affairs were not under his jurisdiction. Accompanying the superior officer on inspections and participating in the revision of the clauses was a normal matter, and it is difficult to say that he had the intention of facilitating others' misconduct. Although the Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu, which he introduced to Wan Molin, were granted grain loans, the defendant argued that he only knew that the two companies had strong organizations, large capital, and were good at doing things, so he mentioned them to Wan Molin as a reference during the conversation. This is consistent with the facts, and since the Tongyi and Jiangbei companies in northern Jiangsu did not commit any crimes, the defendant's introduction cannot be said to have been collusion for profit. Since the defendant lacks criminal evidence, it is difficult to constitute any criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>In summary, the criminal suspicion of defendant Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian in the Shanghai grain loan case is insufficient. In accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, non-prosecution is ordered. Prosecutor Wu Qihua, Shanghai District Court. November 23, 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The High Court is scheduled to hold a preliminary trial of Wei Te Le Elly Widler's case of colluding with the enemy at 2:30 PM today. Wei is a Swiss national, 58 years old. He was previously accused of forging US dollars, but after investigation by the US military headquarters, it was believed that the evidence was insufficient and the case was withdrawn. However, the Songhu Garrison Command believed that he had other crimes of colluding with the enemy and transferred the case to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate for investigation, which filed a public prosecution. The indictment lists seven crimes committed by the defendant: before the Pacific War, he sold a large amount of copper to the Japanese. After the concession fell, he obtained a special pass due to special relations and had a secret code booklet, which was obviously suspected of being a spy. In addition, he also possessed printing machinery and counterfeited US dollars and Chinese stamps. Wei Te Le is currently detained in Shanghai Prison and has hired lawyer Tang Huaiyu to defend him.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Wu addressed the meeting, stating that the prohibition of opium and narcotics is the government's most important national policy. The public is well aware that the prohibition of opium and narcotics has a significant impact on the nation and a substantial effect on national health. It cannot be achieved solely by a government decree. The mission of the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics is to achieve the goal of eliminating opium and narcotics through publicity and reporting. He expressed hope that all sectors of society would work hard to advance this cause and complete the mission of banning narcotics. This was followed by a speech by Liu Xuehai, which stated, "The prohibition of opium and narcotics has been actively promoted by the municipal government in the past and has had a great effect. However, due to the complexity of Shanghai's environment, the desired goal has not been achieved. Mayor Wu has always advocated for being practical and realistic. Now, he calls on all sectors of society to organize the Committee for Eliminating Opium and Narcotics to take responsibility for providing advice and guidance. In the future, all sectors will also organize the Shanghai Anti-Narcotics Association. Various public opinion organizations and legal entities will stand from the people's perspective to assist the government in implementing the anti-narcotics policy, uphold the national policy of banning opium and narcotics, eliminate obstacles to construction, and promote it as much as possible, with the hope of completing the century-long plan to ban narcotics." After Liu's speech, the following proposals were discussed:</p>

The municipal authorities believe that this decision has a significant impact on the city's revenue and have telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request further consideration. (Reported in yesterday's newspaper). According to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau, the new tax law with various changes, especially the vehicle license tax, differs greatly from the city's current method. Once implemented, the city's tax revenue will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to the capital yesterday to personally consult with the relevant central authorities for an explanation and request a reconsideration. How to handle the city's future tax revenue will be decided after Director Gu returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Shanghai Commercial Association of Cigarettes, Soaps, Candles, and Matches has reported that both wholesalers and retailers have meager profits. Moreover, they are unbearable under the pressure of high-interest loans. The number of forced closures is increasing daily. However, if profits are increased and prices are raised, it will be difficult to compete with general cigarette vendors, creating a dilemma of raising or lowering prices. Currently, the profit margin for wholesalers who distribute goods from factories to retailers is less than 0.5%. If the business tax is calculated based on the total business volume at 1.5%, plus stamp tax and loan interest, there will be no profit, and losses will be incurred. Therefore, the association submitted a request to the Municipal Council yesterday to forward it to the relevant authorities, requesting a simplified method for levying business tax on cigarette merchants. It is learned that the association is scheduled to submit it to the Finance Committee today for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Three Tax Issues to be Discussed by the Municipal Council Today <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At the first meeting of the Municipal Council, the entertainment tax rate in this city was approved to be increased by 50%, and the Finance Bureau was requested to implement it accordingly. Various relevant entertainment groups repeatedly requested a reduction to 40%, but this was not allowed. After one month of collection by the Finance Bureau, it was felt that in the current situation of economic depression in all industries, the entertainment industry is also depressed and unable to bear the 50% tax. In order to consider the difficulties of the people, the Finance Bureau plans to temporarily reduce the tax rate to 40% to show consideration. A special submission has been made to the Municipal Council for approval. It is learned that the Municipal Council has submitted it to the Finance Committee for discussion and decision at its fifth meeting today. It is also learned that the matters to be discussed by the committee today include adjusting the slaughter tax rate, reducing the profit tax of pig farmers, and requesting the allocation of part of the Japanese reparations and enemy and puppet materials to carry out construction projects in this city.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Post Office recently received an order from the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications to carry out staff reductions. As the post office's affairs are quite complicated, there is a feeling that there is no way to start reducing staff. However, the instructions from the Ministry must be followed, and the post office's finances are also very tight. It is learned that in order to reduce the number of staff, the post office plans to start from the following points: 1. Simplify procedures, 2. Increase agencies, 3. Utilize machines. Within this year, the post office plans to add 100 agencies in various districts to handle the consignment of postal millet and the collection of registered mail. At the same time, it will use machine bicycles to collect mail and specially make mailboxes for sale to the public to facilitate postal delivery.</p>
<p>The population of this city has doubled compared to before the war, and the postal service has also become more complicated than before the war. Airmail has increased sevenfold compared to before the war, express mail has increased fivefold, and registered mail has increased twofold. However, the number of staff at the Shanghai Post Office is still less than before the war. The post office receives 300,000 letters daily and delivers 700,000 letters daily. The number of transit letters is about 260,000 daily.</p>

<p>Zhu Yicai, 64 years old, from Wuxi, is the chairman of the Yangzhou Zhenyang Electric Company. After the victory, he was reported, accusing Zhu of cooperating with the enemy after the fall of Yangzhou, reusing Japanese nationals Sanben and several ronin, and selling more than 200 tons of steel to the enemy Xinye Company. In addition, he also served as a supervisor of the enemy Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. The defendant Wu Ren once served as a supervisor of the project and stated that after the fall of Yangzhou, the Zhenyang Company was not taken over by the Japanese, but was still handled by the Chinese, which was no different from before the war. Sanben was a section chief in the company and was only responsible for purchasing coal. The sale of scrap iron was handled by manager Zhu Hanfu, and the defendant did not know the details. Moreover, the Xin Aluminum Factory was not opened by the Japanese. The case was retried yesterday afternoon, and Zhu Hanfu and Yin Baoshu, the Chinese merchant who purchased the scrap iron, were brought to court. After questioning, the court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Many Troubles at Jing'an Temple; Disputes over Temple Property; Rejection of Six Roots' Takeover; Struggle Not Easily Ended <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Jing'an Temple seems to have always been fraught with troubles, perhaps related to the enormous temple property! These two days have seen another good show of takeover, which has not yet ended. The matter has been brewing for a long time. Recently, on the evening of the 23rd, Six Roots invited reporters from various newspapers in the city to the Jinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. During the dinner, he reported that he would return to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple, rectify the temple rules, and liquidate the temple property.</p>
<p>The next day, the newspapers featured "Public Announcement by Jing'an Temple Dharma Protectors and Patrons Supporting Monk Six Roots' Return to the Temple to Resume His Position," "Public Announcement by Shanghai Buddhist Tonsure Sect Temples," and "Public Announcement by Merchants Near Jing'an Temple." The content of the public announcements all requested Monk Six Roots to return to the temple to resume his position.</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM on this day, more than a dozen Dharma protectors and patrons accompanied Monk Six Roots to Jing'an Temple to resume his position, but they were rejected by the monks of Jing'an Temple and representatives of the Shanghai Branch of the Buddhist Association. After a disturbance lasting more than four hours, Six Roots and others returned.</p>
<p>Monks Bai Sheng and Yu Mei told reporters that Six Roots had no reason to try to take over the temple property. They unanimously stated that Six Roots' return to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple was completely illegal, and he was not qualified to serve as the abbot of Jing'an Temple.</p>
<p>However, will Monk Six Roots simply give up like this? Can the struggle for Jing'an Temple be ended so easily? The answer is probably a "no." In fact, what fame and fortune are there for monks to pursue? This is truly a kind of worldly irony.</p>

<p>Young Zhu, 34 years old, from Luodian, usually makes a meager profit by transporting passengers and goods between various towns and villages by bicycle. Yesterday morning, he came to Shanghai by bicycle. When he passed near Xujiahui Town, due to traffic congestion, young Zhu panicked and overturned his bicycle onto a tiger cart. The cart was full of paper-cutting steel knives, which were extremely sharp, causing young Zhu's right index finger to be cut off immediately. Blood flowed like a river, and he fainted immediately. At that time, a passerby, Mr. Wang, passed by and saw the situation. He hired a pedicab to accompany him to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment! According to the doctor, the injured person needs surgery to remove the severed finger completely. Young Zhu, being a poor man, cannot afford the medical expenses. He applied for the emergency aid organized by this newspaper and has been approved. The girl Wang Qingfang, 6 years old, resides at her uncle's house at No. 148 Kangping Road. Her parents both work as helpers in this city and make a meager income, barely enough to make ends meet. At the beginning of this month, Qingfang contracted severe malaria. Due to a lack of funds for treatment, her condition worsened day by day. She suffered from alternating chills and fever and extreme pain. Her old edema also broke out at the same time, making the situation even more critical. After her family sent her to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital on Xujiahui Road for treatment, she gradually recovered. She applied for the emergency aid of this newspaper and has been approved for 130,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Compliance with Negotiated Prices; Oil Market Resumes Yesterday; Factories Continue to Allocate 1,300 Dan; Pudong District Should Pay and Pick Up Goods Today <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The oil market was suspended for several days. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the oil and grain industry delegated Zhang Chao to submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to resume oil market transactions. Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, forwarded the request to Mayor Wu and obtained his approval. However, there were conditions: the market transaction price must be within the negotiated price and must not engage in black market trading. In addition, the names of customers and brokers for future oil market transactions must be filled out on triplicate forms and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau on a daily basis for verification. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered edible oil vendors, retailers, middlemen, and brokers to send five or six representatives each to supervise transactions in the market. The oil market officially resumed yesterday. 256 dan of Qingdao raw oil were opened at 135,000 yuan per dan. A batch of Jipu barrel raw oil (including barrels) one-week futures was opened at 145,000 yuan per dan. The transactions were able to comply with the negotiated price regulations, and the situation was considered good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, various private factories continued to allocate 500 dan of oil, including 80 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, 100 dan of Dachang new soybean oil, 80 dan of Dade new rapeseed oil, 60 dan of Shunyu soybean oil, 80 dan of Changde soybean oil, 20 dan of sesame oil, 40 dan of Dasheng sesame oil, and 40 dan of Weimin sesame oil. Among them, 100 dan of sesame oil were returned to the factories because the need for sesame oil in this city was less. The shortfall will be made up tomorrow. The oil allocated yesterday was allocated to 146 retail stores in Pudong, and each store can be allocated 3.5 dan. Retail stores in the Pudong district can go to the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office today to pay for the goods and facilitate delivery.</p>
<p>In addition to allocating soybean, rapeseed, and sesame oil, various factories also allocated 800 dan of Qing oil yesterday, which has been properly allocated by the Joint Allocation Office.</p>
<p>According to people in the oil industry, the market price of Qingdao raw oil has been trending downward in recent days, with each dan being 108,000 yuan. The price upon arrival in Shanghai should be within 140,000 yuan, with the hope of further decline. Zhaoshangju's Haihuanghai and Shouxing vessels will transport the oil in batches from Qingdao. In addition to the China Edible Oil Company having a large shipment, transportation companies will also have several thousand barrels arriving one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Although the Central Bank is Trying to Stabilize the Gold Market, the Rise is Still Fierce; Speculative Atmosphere for US Dollars is Lighter <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The buying frenzy was even stronger yesterday, and the Central Bank was once again in a difficult battle. It opened at 2.63 million in the morning. With pressure from the Central Bank, sellers appeared intermittently during the week. It once fell to 2.61 million, but was chased by buyers and gradually rebounded. The Central Bank allocated 300 bars at a price of 2.6475 million. After 10:00 AM, those who exchanged stocks for gold came to participate, and the rise became even greater, breaking through the 2.7 million mark. The Central Bank suppressed it again at high prices, and it slightly returned to around 2.675 million near noon. It continued to rise in the afternoon, hovering between 2.68 million and 2.69 million. As a result, it rose by another 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was raised to 284,000. Silver ingots were flat, while silver dollars were slightly better. The shadow interest rate remained at around 12 to 15%.</p>
<p>The rise in foreign currency prices was not as good as the price of gold. The shadow market for US dollars opened at 4,800 yuan to 4,830 yuan in the morning. After opening, the buying price once fell to 4,780 yuan. Later, the surge in the gold market boosted buying sentiment, but the speculative atmosphere was lighter. Although it rose, transactions were not widespread. Therefore, 4,900 yuan was the highest price. At noon, it struggled between 4,820 yuan and 4,870 yuan. In the afternoon, there were slightly fewer buyers, and the price rose slightly again to between 4,830 yuan and 4,880 yuan. As a result, it was slightly better by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars were also passively raised by 10 yuan. The US exchange rate remained the same, while the Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly to between 940 yuan and 950 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was between 1,130 yuan and 1,150 yuan, and the British exchange rate was between 1,500 yuan and 1,520 yuan.</p>

<p>The bond market was extremely mediocre yesterday. Tongbing opened at 1,380 yuan in the morning, and the low price fell below 1,350 yuan. Two major players on the 5th floor were selling, but a certain player on the 8th floor and major players such as Fuyuan were still accepting, and it rebounded to above 1,400 yuan at the close. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Jiayi and Jiyi were flat, while Tongding fell by 50 yuan and Tongwu fell by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Tea Market Transactions Sluggish <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In the Zhuang tea market, some cargo owners adjusting capital are still selling off their goods, while buyers continue to seize the opportunity to suppress prices. Transactions are quite sluggish, and prices are evidently flat or declining. According to industry insiders, although there is demand for Chinese tea in foreign countries, the disparity in overseas selling prices makes it difficult to promote sales. At the same time, the scarcity of ships also makes exports doubly difficult. As for domestic sales, they are all narrow and the situation is ordinary and unremarkable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tea Export Association of the China Tea Industry Association, and representatives of tea petitioners from various provinces, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian, held a joint meeting at the China Tea Industry Association yesterday at 3:00 PM. Shou Jingwei was elected as chairman. Shou gave a speech, stating that tea merchants in Shanghai and tea farmers in various provinces are all affected by high-interest loans and are in dire straits. Therefore, the issues to be discussed today are: (1) the tea purchase problem for this year, and (2) the fundamental problem of tea export trade. Subsequently, the representatives firmly requested Shou to serve as the head of the petition delegation, and drafted measures for tea purchases this year. It is expected that after discussion at a meeting to be held at the China Tea Industry Association at 3:00 PM on the 28th of this month (Thursday), the date for the delegation's trip to Beijing can be determined.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Silk Mills Appeal for Relief, Costs Double Selling Prices <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>More than fifty silk reeling mills in this city are suffering heavy losses. In addition to making an urgent appeal to the authorities, they are also requesting relevant agencies such as the China Trust Bureau and the China Silk Corporation to raise the purchase price of raw silk. According to the cost calculation for autumn cocoon reeling, each dan of raw silk reaches 6,395,000 yuan, plus interest on expenses (silk merchants need to invest 20 million yuan for every 100 million yuan loan to purchase cocoons and produce silk, and the monthly interest reaches 3 million yuan), each dan costs around 7 million yuan. Therefore, the industry hopes to raise the price to 7 million yuan per dan, a difference of almost double the current purchase price of 3.8 million yuan per dan. It is said that if the price is not raised, all operations will be stranded within the year, and there is no hope of starting work next year. According to the person in charge of the China Silk Corporation, the current stock of cocoons can only be reeled until the end of the lunar year, and there is no supply for next spring.</p>

Among them, old stock serge, such as "Four Gentlemen," "Yuan Gong Ni," "Jumping Carp," and "Electric Light Twill," are in great demand on this street, and the market price has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The grey cloth market is extremely mediocre. The total transaction volume is 92,000 yuan for "Dragon Head" fine cloth, 91,000 yuan for "Five Blessings" fine cloth, and 89,000 yuan for "Colored Ball" fine cloth.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau's twelfth allocation of viscose rayon maintained the original price for all colors. However, there were more patterned colors allocated. "Great Wealth" was 2.77 million yuan per case, "High Mountain" was 2.75 million yuan per case, and the price of "Early Sun" was the same as "High Mountain." In addition to the allocation to the electrical machinery industry, the applications for the monthly consumption of the weaving, dyeing, and knitting industries have all been approved. Seventy-five weaving companies were allocated 123 cases, and 105 dyeing companies were allocated 187 cases. The knitting and electrical machinery industries will be allocated after the purchase volume for this period is submitted to the bureau. The bureau stated that since all manufacturers have been allocated, and there is no need in the market, the allocation of viscose rayon to viscose merchants will be temporarily suspended. The bureau requires each industry to submit a list of the quantity needed for December before the 27th of this month for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fine Yarn Still Has Black Market, Outport Allocation to be Discussed This Thursday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to Liu Wenteng, director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Commission, the dyeing and weaving industries in Changzhou, Wuxian, Wuxi, and Jiangyin have recently submitted requests for yarn allocation. According to the report from the Changzhou Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, there are a total of 69 dyeing and weaving factories in the area, with a total of 4,423 looms, requiring a total of 8,539 pieces of yarn of various counts per month. However, according to the investigation by the Changzhou Three People's Principles Youth League branch, there are 91 dyeing and weaving factories, with a total of 3,500 looms, requiring a total of 6,000 pieces of yarn of various counts per month. According to the report from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, there are 42 cloth factories, and according to the current operating situation, they need 150 pieces of 42-count yarn, 150 pieces of 32-count yarn, and 400 pieces of 20-count yarn per month. Wuxi and Jiangyin only submitted requests for yarn allocation, without providing the required quantity. The proposals will be made into motions and submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Textile Control Commission this Thursday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became more active because the Shenxin Yarn Factory had 100 pieces each of 16-count Guangming and 10-count Shuangxi yarns, which were specially allocated to yarn trading companies. In addition, the amount sold by Fangjian Yongan last week made the chips on the market slightly more abundant, and the transaction volume increased compared to last week. All transactions are carried out in accordance with the new regulations of the authorities, and both parties immediately report to the association, which forwards them to the Textile Control Commission. However, those who generally seek spot goods for yarn threads above 20 counts still have to find ways to obtain them through the black market.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Textile Control Authorities Talk About Yarn Prices: Raw Cotton Prices Have Not Risen, Wages Have Increased Slightly <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] When the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a meeting a few days ago, it stated that the price of raw cotton had changed, and the production cost of cotton yarn had increased. It was proposed that the Price Negotiation Committee re-adjust the previously negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. The reporter consulted the person in charge of the Textile Control Commission on this matter. It was answered that the Textile Control Commission had not yet received the Cotton Spinning Association's request to adjust the negotiated price of cotton yarn. If there is a request in the future, the Textile Control Commission will consider it. However, it was reported that when the negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn was set, the CIF price of American cotton in Shanghai was 36 cents per pound. At present, the CIF price of American cotton in Shanghai is 32 cents per pound. Therefore, in terms of the cost of raw cotton, it has decreased compared to before. However, the cost of living for workers is indeed slightly higher than the standard when the price of 1.75 million yuan was agreed upon.</p>

<p>The Leather and Raw Materials Industry Association in this city currently has about 250 members, divided into shop owners and household owners.

<p>According to its import company, the first batch of caustic soda shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai will arrive in three or four days, and the volume arriving within the year could reach around 5,000 barrels.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market price fell sharply because 600 new barrels of Hong Kong goods were available for sale on the market, priced at only 1.4 million yuan per barrel, while buyers bid 1.2 million yuan, a drop of 1 million yuan per barrel compared to Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e145">War Losses Too Severe, Insufficient Power, Wuxi's Industry Not Easy to Restore to Former Glory <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Qian Zhonghan, the executive director of the Wuxi Four District Flour Industry Association, recently returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. According to his report, Wuxi's industry has not yet recovered its former glory due to war losses and insufficient power. Taking the most prosperous yarn factory as an example, the production volume is only half of that before the war. As for the flour industry, the Maofu factory, which was large-scale before the war, was burned down during the war, and the Jiuyan factory has not yet resumed work. In terms of the number of factories that have started work, it accounts for 60% of all flour factories; however, due to insufficient power, they only operate for 12 hours a day and take a break every other day, so the production volume cannot be compared with the past. As for silk factories, the three largest factories, Yongtai, Huaxin, and Dingchang, have all failed to resume work due to war losses, and the production volume is less than half of that before the war. Insufficient power is the main reason why Wuxi's industry cannot recover. If the industry in the area is to develop, the power supply needs to be increased three times. The machinery of the local power plant was damaged during the war, and the supply of coal is insufficient, so it cannot meet the needs of the local industry.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks were still one-sidedly down yesterday. The so-called multi-head organization was powerless and suddenly collapsed. The sharp decline was even more severe near noon. Except for the slight increase in Xianxin at the opening, the rest suddenly appeared weak. After the opening, panic set in, and many closed out their positions and were unable to support themselves. Although there was a slight rebound, it was only temporary. Then, there was a rush to short sell. With little supply and deep demand, the market outside was extremely eager, which caused the multiple heads of a certain company to be cut off, and people became even more panic. Although the sellers were scattered, the buyers were timid, and the source of supply was continuous. Floating more temporarily sold near noon, and new lows were seen near noon. The afternoon closing rebounded slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongshen, Xianxin, and Jingfu fell by half a percent, and Meiya, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about 10%. Although the Chinese stock market did not fall too much, the unpopular stocks Xinya, Yonggong, and Nei Yi each fell by about 10%. Zhongfang, Lian'an, Cement, and Jinglun were flat, and the rest fell slightly. In the futures market, Yongshen, Xianxin, and Jingfu fell by half a percent, Huashan fell slightly by less than half a percent, Meiya, Qinxing, and Xinguang fell by 10%, and Yonggong went short at the opening. In the afternoon, there were still some big traders on the market, but the market was dominated by short sellers. The "38" stock was on sale, and finally, another tragic plunge occurred. Now, Yongshen has broken the 500 yuan mark, and the futures Meiya has tragically fallen to the limit down. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongshen and Xianxin fell by 8%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about 15%. Huashan fell by half a percent. Among the unpopular stocks, except for Wuhe, Lian'an, Youfang, and Jinglun, which were flat, the rest fell by 15% to 10%. In the futures market, Yongshen, Xianxin, Jingfu, and Qinxing fell by 10%, Meiya and Xinguang fell by 15%, and Huashan also fell by half a percent. All stocks outside the market fell sharply.</p>

As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha, Yinglian, Ye Guang, Qia Pi fell slightly, the steel industry fell by slightly less than half a percent, the paper and shipping industries rose slightly, and Jardine Matheson was flat.</p>

<p>The rice market arrived with about 17,000 shi of rice from the north and south, mainly japonica rice. Southern japonica fell by 2,000 yuan, and northern japonica fell by 1,000 yuan. Sales were still sluggish. Baiyuan and Yinyuan both fell by slightly more than 1,000 yuan. However, the market was brisk due to the shortage of Yangxian and Buxian rice. Japonica and indica rice diverged. Duxian rice was flat and weak. Flour prices continued to decline step by step. Miscellaneous brands of flour continued to fall by a small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat remained flat. The oil market was allocated a total of 800 dan, and the trend was soft.

Red grain fell by a small amount of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Sino-American Industrial Corporation Emphasizes Industry and Water Conservancy Uses Import Profits to Make Up for Export Losses and Builds Various Public Utilities in Chengdu <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] A key person in charge of Sino-American Industrial Corporation told reporters: "The company is a business jointly organized by Chinese and American people. It hopes to serve as a bridge between the two countries so that American manpower and materials can be used for the reconstruction and construction of our country." The company's current capital is set at 3 billion yuan in national currency. In terms of organization and personnel, the board of directors has 25 directors, with Mr. Li Mingyang, a Chinese national, as the chairman, and the famous Flying Tiger General Chennault as the managing director; there are nine supervisors, and under the board of directors, there is a design committee. The rest of the personnel configuration is: one general manager, one deputy general manager, and three departments: general affairs, accounting, and business, all of which are headed by Chinese nationals.</p>
<p>The department also has an industrial investment department that designs and implements various industrial investments. The head office of the Sino-American Industrial Corporation is located in this city, and branches are located in major ports. The branches in Changsha and Hankou have now been established, and the ones in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Guilin are under preparation. The principle of economy is adopted in the employment of people, and efforts are made to save expenses. Therefore, the head office currently has only more than 20 people, and the branch offices have only about 10 people. The company is currently going through registration procedures with the government, and business is being actively prepared. Everything is done in a "do before you say" and "steady and steady" manner. The company will publicly meet the public when the business is officially launched.</p>
<p>The goal of the Sino-American Industrial Corporation is to use the profits from imports to subsidize the losses from exports. Among the imported goods, emphasis is placed on large and small hardware, western medicines, and agricultural and industrial machinery. The exported products focus on tung oil, hog bristles, etc. The current business that has been promoted is the introduction by the company to enable the Chengdu Municipal Government to sign contracts with two major American companies, whereby the latter will provide capital and technology to build Chengdu's tap water, electricity, telephone, public transportation, sewerage, and hospital bed equipment, six major projects. The total amount of project funding is more than 10 billion yuan in legal currency. The materials and services provided by the American side are regarded as loans rather than investments, which will be repaid by the Sichuan Provincial Government within five to ten years, with an interest rate of 4% to 6%. The principles have been agreed upon by both parties. If this move is successful, the company plans to introduce American resources and technology to rebuild the cities in our country that were most severely damaged during the war, such as Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou.</p>
<p>The Sino-American Industrial Corporation also intends to contribute to the current housing shortage problem. However, the scope of its efforts is not willing to be limited to coastal cities and plans to popularize it in the interior and rural areas. It is currently in contact with an American company to move a mobile home manufacturing plant to our country, use domestic timber, and manufacture locally, so as to save the uneconomical transportation. The machinery of this manufacturing plant can produce 15,000 square feet of wood panels per day for construction purposes. The company has sent someone to study its performance and hopes to close the deal soon.</p>
<p>The company's long-term plan focuses entirely on the construction of industry and water conservancy. In the industrial sector, it hopes to build a large-scale yarn factory in Hankou and establish a large oil refinery in the central China region to refine tung oil, making it easier to export. In the water conservancy sector, it has even greater ambitions. It is currently in contact to order 500 to 1,000 water pumps, and then select appropriate areas to establish rural service stations to irrigate for farmers. It is estimated that each irrigation machine can irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land, and 1,000 machines can irrigate 1 million mu of land, which will definitely benefit people's livelihoods. The person in charge of the company repeatedly emphasized that it is willing to introduce the capital and technology of friendly countries in the position of a private enterprise to assist the government in carrying out construction work.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Tangshan] The professors at Tangshan Institute of Technology are striking because their salaries are meager and they cannot maintain their livelihoods. This semester, they asked the education authorities to change the salary structure to the level of professors in the Tianjin-Beijing area. Since their request was not met, they are still on strike. The weather is getting colder, and there is no coal or rice. The students have been out of school for half a year and are about to freeze and starve. They are very anxious. When meeting with the reporter, they showed a petition, which is transcribed below for the authorities: "The students of Tangshan Institute of Technology, who have been idle for half a year, are still not attending classes due to the strike by the professors who asked the authorities to issue salaries at the level of the Tianjin-Beijing area. They can only stare blankly at the desks arranged in the classroom and the repaired water heaters. The reply from the Ministry of Education is delayed. Some people say: Perhaps the Ministry of Education is busy holding the National Congress these days and has no time to pay attention to the strike by the professors of Tangshan Institute of Technology. Then, when will we be able to attend classes? It is also pitiful to say that the salary of a professor is no more than 300,000 yuan at most, while the prices in Tangshan, taking rice as an example, are 800 yuan per catty, and that is still substandard goods. In Shanghai, one liter is only 600 yuan. Other items are all shipped from Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and other places. Tangshan, except for coal production, has nothing else. Recently, due to the unrest in the surrounding areas, grain prices are rising every day. Even coal is not easy to buy. This winter, the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology in the coal-producing area still have no coal to rely on. They cannot afford to buy it on the black market, and they cannot buy it on the official market. Although the weather this year has been particularly variable, and the cold god has arrived late, it is a strange omen of extreme cold. The shadow of hunger and cold has enveloped the teachers and students of Tangshan Institute of Technology. They were not killed by artillery fire during the war, but they will freeze and starve to death this year. It is really unexpected! I hope the Ministry of Education will have some compassion and solve the problem as soon as possible, so that the good time will not be spent in idleness, and the students will be anxious all day long!</p>

<p>Introducing Services to Overseas Chinese Schools</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] In order to train and improve the quality of teachers for overseas Chinese education, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has successively held teacher training courses and overseas Chinese normal schools. Later, due to the impact of the war, most of them were not sent to serve overseas. Now, more than a year after the recovery, only more than half of the overseas Chinese schools in various places have been restored. Most of them have been unable to re-establish schools due to economic difficulties and lack of teachers. The quality of teachers employed in the schools that have been restored is also mostly low. Now, in order to send or introduce teachers to serve in overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools and facilitate management, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has specially formulated regulations for sending teachers abroad to serve. The regulations have been announced and implemented.</p>

<p>Xie En'gao, director of the Secondary Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, reported on the general situation of secondary education in Shanghai in the past year at the City Government Memorial Week at 9:00 am yesterday, divided into three points: (1) Current situation: There are currently 225 secondary schools in this city, with a total of 619 classes in senior high schools and 24,377 students, and 1,079 classes in junior high schools and 52,199 students. Among the 225 schools, 21 are municipal, 201 are private, 2 are national, and 1 is provincial. Among the municipal middle schools, 16 are general middle schools with 10,047 students, 4 are normal schools with 625 students, and 1 is a vocational school with 132 students. In terms of quantity, municipal schools account for 9%, classes account for 16%, and students account for 15%. (2) Past facilities: After the restoration of this city, many of the original municipal middle schools were destroyed by war. Middle schools such as Wuben and Jingye were restored one after another, and six schools such as Gaoqiao, Zhenru, City West, Fuxing, Yangsi, and Luxing were established successively. Private schools were actively reorganized, registered, and inspected, and audited. The organization of the school board was improved, the schools were urged to establish economic audit committees, and the qualifications of teachers were verified, and the academic performance and student status were reviewed. These tasks must be continued next year. (3) Future guidelines: For the future development of secondary education, improving quality is the most important thing. Expanding existing schools and increasing classes will make management easier, and more vocational middle schools should be established to meet the needs of this city. In order to thoroughly transform the environment and coordinate with urban design, it is most ideal to use public land and move middle schools in the urban area to the suburbs and manage them in a centralized manner.</p>

<p>Decision to Rectify Service Efficiency</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Referees Association held a monthly meeting a few days ago, with more than 20 new and old members attending. Chairman Zhou Jiaqi presided over the meeting, discussing association affairs, rules, and refereeing methods. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning.

Members should prepare and submit opinions on amending the constitution or improving association affairs in advance. (2) Members should prepare a uniform when serving as referees. The association will find funds to tailor and distribute them in the near future. The distribution list is limited to current serving members. (3) Members who accept a refereeing appointment but fail to appear at the game hinder the progress of the match.

<h3 id="e156">Women's Basketball Initially Uses Men's Rules, "Snow White" Women Unable to Withstand a Single Blow, "Black and White" Achieves a Great Victory Last Night, "Black and White" Men Suffer Defeat in a Fierce Battle Against "Giants" <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The "Black and White" women's basketball team played their first game last night in Shanghai using men's rules. As expected, the "Snow White" team was unable to withstand a single blow, and "Black and White" won a great victory by a score of 35 to 10. The halftime score was 19 to 3. "Black and White" did whatever they wanted throughout the game. "Snow White" appeared inferior in running stamina and throwing ability, and could only submit to "Black and White." While the women's team won, the men's team suffered a defeat against the "Giants," 34 to 37. The difference was only three points. The halftime score was tied at 12 points each. The first half was very close. In the second half, the "Giants" scored sharply. "Black and White" bravely tried to catch up, but unfortunately, they fell short. The "Black and White" performance seemed to have improved.</p>
<p>"Black and White" Women's Team Does Whatever They Want</p>
<p>In the first game, the "Black and White" women's team faced "Snow White" again. It was the visiting team's first time using men's rules in Shanghai. Chen Baolin was the referee. "Black and White" started with Huang Rulan, Chen Yurun, Xiao Fanleng, Ouyang Meilan, and Wu Yuwu. "Snow White" responded with Zhang Xiuli, Wang Huilin, Ren Kuanping, Zhu Jiazhen, and Huang Ruyu. Chen Yurun of "Black and White" opened the scoring. Huang Rulan made a beautiful shot, and Yuwu tossed the ball in, scoring six consecutive points. "Snow White" was very unaccustomed to the men's rules and was at a loss. It wasn't until the score was 9 to 0 that Zhang Xiuli scored a basket. The first quarter ended with 15 to 2. When the second quarter began, "Snow White" only scored one point on a free throw by Huang Ruyu. The first half ended with 19 to 3, "Black and White" leading. After the break, "Black and White" made major substitutions. Chen Yurun scored twice, and Lu Shuhui made a basket. Wang Huilin of "Snow White" scored a long-range shot. "Black and White" led comfortably in the third quarter with a score of 26 to 7. The final quarter was still dominated by "Black and White." Zhang Xiuli of "Snow White" pulled back two points. When the regulation time expired, "Black and White" defeated "Snow White" again with a score of 35 to 10.</p>
<p>"Black and White" Men Fall Short</p>
<p>Following that, the "Black and White" men's team took the stage and faced Maoren. The visiting team had the American player Pete Gurney assisting them. "Black and White" also worked hard to reduce unnecessary substitutions, so the first half was quite exciting. The referees were Qu Honglu and Wu Xiaodi. "Black and White" started with Lin Ziyi, Ye Kexi, Xu Yinzhen, Shi Rongluo, and Zhuang Yufeng. The "Giants" started with the Saas King brothers, Yelong, Pete Gurney, and Qiang Dulai. A. Saas King opened the scoring. Ye Kexi scored one point on a free throw. After a long period of contention, the "Giants" won the first quarter by a small margin of 5 to 3. At the beginning of the second quarter, Lin Ziyi made a shot, tying the score. "Black and White" replaced Zhuang Yufeng with Captain Fu Yongxin. Pete Gurney made a one-handed basket, and Yongxin responded in kind. After Yelong threw the ball in, Shen Renshou replaced Lin Ziyi for "Black and White." "Black and White" chased hard, and the situation was very tense. The first half ended in a 12-12 tie.</p>
<p>After the break, Tao Bolinji scored on a free throw. Xu Yinzhen made a shot, and "Black and White" took the lead 14 to 13. Then the score became tied again at 16 each. At this time, "Black and White" frequently made substitutions. The "Giants" took advantage of this weakness. Pete Gurney scored five consecutive baskets in one breath. After the third quarter, "Black and White" had 19, and the "Giants" had 27. In the last quarter, Pete Gurney made more great contributions. The difference was ten points. "Black and White" then quickly chased directly. Ye Kexi, Lin Ziyi, Fu Yongxin, and others scored eight consecutive points, so the score became closer again. In the end, the score was 33 to 35, only one basket behind. The audience shouted encouragement, but Neff Knicks tossed the ball in under the basket, sealing the victory for the "Giants." By the time Ye Kexi scored on a free throw, time had run out. "Black and White" was defeated by the "Giants" with a score of 34 to 37.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch on the 25th] More than 180 returning students from Normal College, Chaoyang, Yanjing and other schools arrived in Peiping on the evening of the 21st after a long trek of four months. According to their statement: They traveled via the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou, then northward along the Pinghan Line, sometimes walking and sometimes taking the train. They passed through the communist areas several times, and some of the students were taken away by the communist army, and several were shot and wounded. When they arrived in Shijiazhuang, the northern section of the Pinghan Line was heavily damaged by the communist army, and they stayed in Shijiazhuang for forty days. Later, because there was no hope of restoring traffic, they walked north again. When they arrived south of Baoding, they encountered the communist army again, who persuaded them to go to the "North China United University" which had been relocated from Zhangjiakou to Hejian, Hebei, but they politely declined. Fortunately, they were not harassed and finally arrived in Baoding. After staying in Baoding for two days, they continued north and took a train on the Pinghan Road to Peiping at Gaobeidian. They suffered greatly along the way.</p>

<p>Regarding the doubts about the time limit for various clauses of Article 9 of the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination Law, which stipulates that one shall not be allowed to take the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination, the Examination Committee explained that, except for Clause 4 "Has been punished for embezzlement and private gain", which has been interpreted as being limited to those who have been subject to criminal punishment and has no time limit, and Clause 7 "Subject to the restrictions of Article 9 or Article 18 of the Nationality Law, and has not been lifted", the time limit of the original articles of the Nationality Law has been clearly stipulated. For the time limits of the remaining clauses, one shall be allowed to participate in the examination as soon as the relevant restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>It has also been reported to the Examination Yuan for explanation, roughly as follows: "The investigation of embezzlement and private gain should be strictly restricted. Those who have been punished for embezzlement and private gain should never be allowed to take the public office candidate examination. As for Clauses 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, whenever the reasons for exclusion are eliminated, such as the arrest warrant has been revoked, the deprivation of civil rights has been restored, (the fixed-term deprivation has expired; the indefinite deprivation has been ordered to be restored), the public funds owed have been repaid, the declaration of prohibition of property management has been revoked, and the use of opium has been quit, the examination shall be allowed according to the interpretation", etc. The Examination Committee has sent separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments for verification.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior believes that unhealthy folk customs, such as worshiping divine power and superstition, foot-binding of women, raising maids, child brides, abortion, and infanticide, urgently need to be investigated, prohibited, and improved. It has formulated a "Measures for Investigating and Prohibiting Unhealthy Folk Customs." It is reported that in these measures, those who offer obscene gods to collect money, use spells and evil techniques to treat diseases, engage in other illegal activities under the guise of divine power and superstition, and form secret societies will be forced to change to other normal occupations. For women's foot-binding, raising maids, and child brides, measures such as advising liberation, terminating contracts, and compulsory liberation and termination of contracts will be adopted. For abortion and infanticide, measures such as propaganda and guidance, relief, and referral to judicial organs for handling will be used to investigate and prohibit them. The above measures have been approved by the Ministry of Interior, and the municipal government has been instructed to check and implement them. The municipal government has also issued orders to the relevant bureaus and offices to follow the original measures and jointly formulate and submit for approval detailed rules for the implementation of the investigation and prohibition of unhealthy folk customs in this city.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Xi'an City Conditions: Price Hikes, Price Limits, Black Market Prices, and Pricelessness Amidst Turmoil <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Air Dispatch on the 17th, by Li Chi, our correspondent in Xi'an</p>
<p>This summer, in July, I wrote a dispatch for this newspaper saying that the prices in Chang'an were low and cheap. Therefore, although the war ended a year ago, the population has instead increased. At that time, the low prices in Xi'an ranked it in the fourth or fifth tier among the forty-odd provincial capitals and cities in the country. Unexpectedly, in just three or four months, within the last forty days, the price surge led by rice, wheat, and flour has been like a raging fire in a whirlwind, igniting the daily lives of 999 out of 1,000 citizens. The current food problem is clearly not due to a poor harvest or thin reserves, but rather due to manipulated sales prices and unreasonably soaring prices, as well as the need to improve allocation technology. The price of grain in Xi'an has now reached the pinnacle of the "pyramid," even three or four times higher than in other counties within the province. According to travelers coming west from the Longhai Railway in the east, the prices in Xi'an are even the highest along the line. After passing this "highest peak," the road slopes downward all the way westward. Recently, "single carriers" have also appeared between Xi'an and Baoji. Even if a person transports only three or five dou, they can make a profit. This is an unprecedented event on this railway line. The citizens of Xi'an have no choice but to turn to the black market for flour at more than 30,000 yuan per bag and rice at more than 70,000 yuan per zu, which are clearly higher than the prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Citizens have mixed opinions on the measures taken by the "price-limiting" authorities. However, everyone seems to want to ask: Since it is not impossible to crack down on this 1/1000th of "certain people" who are manipulating grain prices, then how long will their "special profits" continue?</p>
<p>Seasonal Fluctuations</p>
<p>I opened up various price records in Xi'an dating back to 1937. First, I set aside the general trend of gradually increasing prices due to inflation. Then, I removed the sudden factors caused by war (defeat and victory) and politics, as well as non-man-made factors such as floods and droughts. I quickly saw a seasonal fluctuation every year at the end of the lunar year. This phenomenon may exist everywhere, and the reason is very obvious. However, it is worth noting which month of each year this seasonal fluctuation begins. According to the normal years before the war, it generally started one month before the end of the lunar year. However, Xi'an has tended to start earlier and earlier in the last four or five years. It initially started in December of each new year, and gradually moved forward to November and October. This year, the "red lantern" of rising prices was raised as early as September. The current price surge will probably not subside and breathe a sigh of relief until after January next year.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Floating capital and hoarding are innately inseparable. However, this autumn, Xi'an's "funds" have been flowing in large quantities to the Yangtze River Delta region, thanks to the higher interbank lending rates in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The interbank lending rate here reached as high as 14% a week ago, which is a rare high interest rate in recent times. According to government announcements, the increase in currency in circulation since July has also been less than in the past. From this, it can be seen that the surge in prices this time cannot be attributed primarily to the amount of currency in circulation and floating capital. It may seem a bit hard to believe, but this time in Xi'an, the surge in grain prices has led this price surge. Some people are taking advantage of the aftermath of the new "335" foreign exchange rate and the rumors of another exchange rate adjustment in Shanghai in early September to make a big fuss! It is difficult for us to understand how the wheat and grain planted in the loess soil of Shaanxi can have such a close connection with the gold yuan on Wall Street in New York!</p>
<p>Flour Mill Production</p>
<p>Although this year's rice and wheat harvests were not very abundant, they were generally better than in an average year. Moreover, the grain tax has been reduced compared to last year. As for the output rate of flour mills in the city, according to expert Liu Youchen's statistics: the city's current monthly production capacity is at least 300,000 bags. (According to the police bureau's higher estimate, the monthly production capacity is 600,000 bags.) This figure is sufficient to meet the city's monthly consumption of 250,000 bags. (Because half of the citizens eat rice and local flour.) Although the flour mills have been suspending production from time to time since August under the pretext of no coal or without any pretext, like malaria, and there is no talk of increasing production with all their strength, in the early days of October, when the city began to experience a flour shortage, countless vehicles loaded with good flour were pulled out of the city into the countryside to "escape." Who says there is a real "shortage"? Or has everything been done to remedy the situation?</p>
<p>The fact is that the price of grain has risen by 100% in forty days! At the end of September, flour (per bag) sold for 16,000 yuan. By the time of the second evaluation in November, it was said to be 20,000 yuan, but the actual black market price exceeded 30,000 yuan. Rice (per dou, equivalent to 15 city catties) rose from 6,400 yuan to 13,000 yuan in the black market during the same period. Wheat (per dou) jumped from 3,000 yuan to 5,500 yuan. At that time, the official price flour also had some "decoration of the city." The twenty officially designated supply stations provided "civilian food" to the 2.5 million flour-eating citizens with two hundred purchase vouchers every day! In this way, do we still have reason to blame the rampant activities of the black market? Standing in long lines, standing for a day or three or five days, crowding in the pile, performing martial arts, and in the end, returning empty-handed and hungry. In such a situation, even though a certain newspaper said: "A supply station is unattended," another newspaper "XXX Newspaper" wrote on the same day that "those who are snapping up on the station are like starving people grabbing food!"</p>
<p>It is indeed "snapping up," and another kind of "snapping up" is in the near suburbs entering the city, by special "powerful people" to "snap up" any food entering the city, and the same is true for charcoal. Fifty days ago, a dan was sold for 20,000 yuan, and it is now sold for 60,000 yuan! If what is "snapped up" is their necessities of life, perhaps it is excusable, but this clearly belongs to "special rights and interests," "how can the law be forgiven"?</p>
<p>Afraid to Manage and Love to Manage</p>
<p>The authorities, of course, have taken measures to deal with the skyrocketing prices. The provincial government was ordered to start implementing price limits in September, and the Commodity Price Review Council was established in October. However, the first resolution of this council on the day of its establishment was to meet with the chairman of the provincial government to request the cancellation of the price limits! (Some people sarcastically said, "Would the Anti-Smoking Association dare to advocate the public sale of opium?" (Chairman Zhu of course could not accept this. On the contrary, he strengthened the price limit policy, and the prices of cotton yarn, meat, wages, etc. were also limited. During this period, citizens watched the price limits take effect and rejoiced. The rampant cotton yarn price was suppressed and became the most successful item in the price limit. Small and medium-sized cloth factories could now be allocated cotton yarn at the limited price. Although the slaughter of beef and mutton was once suspended, it could not be stopped after a few days and automatically resumed business. The photography industry increased the price by 100%, but the business declined sharply and instead "take one get one free," which is "laughable and non-laughable."…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in early November, the price limit was finally overwhelmed by the price increase; and the current new price limit is threatened by "black market," "black prices," and "no goods, no prices." The Department of Finance and the Department of Food intend to allocate and sell food taxes, but the technology is still to be resolved.</p>
<p>Can the new price limit, which is entrusted to the lives of 500,000 citizens, continue to win against the "black price" and suppress the "price increase"? This is a test for the policymakers. The view that "it is not afraid of officials, but only afraid of management" is wrong. If officials can implement a price limit policy that takes the interests of the people as the premise, they will definitely be supported by the people, and the people love to be "managed" by them. However, there is a long and winding road from "afraid to manage" to "love to manage," which is also the watershed between the policymaking style from "old" to "new."</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Zhou Xiangguang, Delhi Airmail, 13th</p>
<p>Delhi is the former capital of the Indian Empire and a historically significant place. It was the capital for various Indian dynasties. According to the Maha-Bharata, in ancient times, King Yudbister made it his capital around 4,000 years BC. Later, during the Muslim conquest of India, the Mughal Empire and its various dynasties all made it their capital. Subsequently, the British invaded India and temporarily established the capital in Calcutta. In 1911, King George V of England declared the capital would be moved from Calcutta to New Delhi, just two miles from Delhi. Today, New Delhi is not only a political center but also a transportation hub. Major railway lines from East, Northwest, Bombay, and Central India converge here. The air route between England and India also terminates here. Industrially, sectors like cotton weaving and steel are also highly developed. Therefore, for those coming to India, besides visiting the so-called three major districts of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, the Indian capital is also a must-see destination.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Red Fort</p>
<p>This summer, after traveling in the Hyderabad Princely State, I took a train here to see the sights of the Indian capital. Initially, I stayed in a Muslim hostel in Punjab. Later, I found the food unsuitable and the facilities inadequate, so I moved to the Imperial Hotel, paying three shields of Indian currency per day for rent, with meals taken outside. This is considered inexpensive given the current cost of living in the Indian capital. On my second day in the Indian capital, I visited Mr. Mukherjee, an Indian friend, in the morning. After a half-hour conversation, he kindly sent his nephew, Mr. Kushal, to accompany me to the Office of the Chinese Commissioner. At that time, the original commissioner had been transferred back to China, and the office affairs were being handled by a first secretary. Mr. Lai Liangliang, a staff member of the office, graduated from the Central Political School and was a handsome young man. We had a very pleasant conversation. New Delhi is a new city built by the British in India, with trees lining the streets and modern urban planning. Often, a circular lawn is used as a starting point for several streets. Newcomers may find it difficult to navigate if they are walking to visit friends.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, I visited the Delhi Red Fort (ReoFort). This fort was originally built by Shah Jahan of the Mughal Dynasty (reigned from 1627 to 1658). The palace inside the fort is built of white marble and carved with intricate patterns, fully showcasing the art of Mughal architecture. The Diwan-I-has, Shah Jahan's hall of audience, is particularly majestic and magnificent. I recall that in the past, the Shah often sat on a peacock throne in this hall, holding court to judge cases or summoning his ministers to give instructions. This peacock throne was later seized by Nadir Shah, the Persian king who invaded India in 1793, but the palace hall remains intact. Whenever the sun sets, the gold ornaments on the marble ceiling and the jewels embedded in the square pillars reflect each other, creating a truly spectacular sight. A Persian couplet is inscribed on the wall: "If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here."</p>
<p>At this time, an American journalist arrived and we became very close. He even took a photo of me as a souvenir. The fort contains museums, Muslim chapels, and is garrisoned by British troops. Last autumn, the Indian National Army, led by S.C. Bose under the protection of Japan and Germany, established a provisional Indian government in Singapore. After the Allied victory in the war and the dissolution of the provisional government, these senior officers of the National Army were captured by the British army in India and charged with disloyalty to the British King and betrayal of the British Empire. The trial was held in this Red Fort. Mr. Nehru wore his lawyer's robes and appeared in court to defend them. As a result, the three leaders of the National Army were sentenced to death by the judges. However, when the verdict was sent to General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, he immediately issued a pardon, releasing them without charge. Therefore, Auchinleck is highly respected by the Indian people for this. The Red Fort is 3,200 feet long, 1,800 feet wide, and about 100 feet high. The exterior is entirely built of red stone and is located by the river. Visitors must purchase a ticket for two annas each. However, due to the presence of the garrison, the Red Fort is only open from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, not all day.</p>
<p>Jama Masjid</p>
<p>After visiting the Red Fort, I went to see the Jama Masjid. The mosque is located about half a mile from the Red Fort and is also built of red stone. The mosque is 200 feet long and 120 feet wide, with a central dome about 130 feet high. The mosque has three large gates, built on the east, north, and south sides. The east gate is the largest, and visitors enter from here. This mosque was also built by Shah Jahan. When the Muslim King resided in Delhi, he would go to the mosque to pray every Friday morning. After a brief visit, I went to the Chinese Commissioner's Office to attend a dinner hosted by Mr. Lai Liangliang. Mr. Lu Haoran, a student studying in India at public expense from the Central Political School, and Mr. Wu Jiangong, who had just arrived in India from Iran, were also present. We met after a long journey and talked very happily. The evening ended at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>On the third morning, I drove to The Hindustan Times to meet Mr. Krinpandhi. He is the chief editorial writer of the newspaper. The newspaper was founded by Mr. D.K. Birla, an Indian industrialist, and Gandhi's son serves as the editor-in-chief. In reality, the younger Gandhi is often not present, and Mr. Krinpandhi is in charge. When I arrived at the newspaper office, Mr. Krinpandhi was unfortunately at home recuperating from an illness. However, a staff member of the newspaper sent someone to accompany me to his home. We were overjoyed to see each other, but unfortunately, he had not yet recovered his health and could not have a long conversation. In the afternoon, I visited the Lakshminarayan Temple. This temple was built in 1938 at a cost of more than 3 million shields of Indian currency. It was funded by Mr. K.K. Birla and is dedicated to the East Indian deities Lakshmi and Krishna. A Buddhist temple is also built next to it, housing a statue of Buddha. It is currently managed by the Ceylon Maha Bodhi Society. There are two great industrialists in India: Mr. Tata, whose former managers, Mr. Matthai, the current Minister of Supply of the Indian Provisional Government, and the Minister of Industry, Mr. Bapu, both held positions with Tata Company; and Mr. Birla, who is the economic backer of the National Congress Party. Birla has four brothers. His third brother, D.G. Birla, is involved in industrial organization, while Birla's eldest brother, J.K. Birla, is a religious believer who specializes in doing good deeds and giving alms. Birla regularly provides assistance to Chinese monks and nuns in India, either by giving money or providing goods. When I arrived at the temple, I met Birla's eldest brother, who was supervising the stone carving work. He was very happy to see me, but unfortunately, he only knew Indian languages and did not understand English. Therefore, we asked his personal secretary, Mr. Shen, to translate our conversation. He wanted me to meet his third brother, saying that General Chiang Kai-shek had stayed at his Calcutta residence during his visit to India in 1942, and General Chiang had invited his brother to visit China. At the same time, he strongly urged me to stay at his temple. I replied that I had to go to Central India the next day and could not stay here for long. I would definitely stay here for a while when I returned to listen to the Brahma bells and cultivate myself for a few days. He nodded in agreement and then bid me farewell. Afterwards, I visited Canaught Place, which is a market designated by the Indian government, similar to the New Market in Calcutta. All kinds of shops are concentrated here, as the other streets in New Delhi are residential areas and do not have shops.</p>
<p>Qutab Minar</p>
<p>Another historical site in the Indian capital is the Qutab Minar, one of India's great buildings, located about eleven miles southwest of Delhi. It is said that the tower was built before the Common Era, and was renovated by Anangpal in the eighth century, and rebuilt by the Chauhan Rajput in the twelfth century. There was no particular purpose for building this historical site at that time. However, according to historians, the Qutab Minar was actually built by PrithviRaj, the last emperor of the Hindu dynasty in India, for his beloved wife who wanted to look at the Junna River from a high place every day. In the twelfth century AD, Kutab-ud-Din renovated it, and at that time, the tower only had one floor. It was not until between 1210 and 1236 AD that Shams-Ud-Din Altamash built it into a five-story tower. In 1351-1358 AD, the fourth and fifth floors of the tower were rebuilt by Firoz Shah Tughlak, which is what it looks like today. The tower is 238 feet high, with a base diameter of 47 feet, and a top diameter of 4 feet. The first floor is 94 feet 11 inches high, the second floor is 50 feet 8 and a half inches, the third floor is 40 feet 3 and a half inches, the fourth floor is 25 feet 4 inches, and the fifth floor is 22 feet 4 inches. Each floor is built of red stone and inlaid with marble, and the patterns on the stone are very delicate and beautiful. Each floor is engraved with scriptures, such as the poem engraved on the first floor:</p>
<p>"If a person can build a tower to dedicate to the Heavenly Emperor, then the Heavenly Emperor will also build a house in the heavenly court in the same way to give to all people."</p>
<p>After the visit, I went with my Indian friend Kholsha to visit Mr. Soloo and was invited to dinner. His daughter, Shakuntala, who was recovering from illness, also came out to serve and chat for a while. I was very impressed by her gentleness. I returned to my residence to rest in the evening.</p>
<p>Delhi University On the fourth day, I planned to visit Delhi University. I first went to the Hindu College to meet Professor White De. Then I went to Delhi University with him for a tour. Professor White used to study at Serampore College, Calcutta University, and he and I were classmates at different times, so we felt regret that we had not met earlier. The Delhi University school building was originally the Governor's residence and is very exquisite. Through Professor White's introduction, I met Dr. Qureshi, the Director of Academic Affairs of the Faculty of Arts of the University. We had a very congenial conversation and he asked me about the situation of universities in China. I answered him one by one. The difference between the university systems of China and India is that India adopts the British system, while China imitates the United States. Therefore, in the current education system in India, there are ten years of primary school, four years of college, and two years of graduate school. In China, there are twelve years of primary and secondary school, and four years of university. Therefore, a Chinese university graduate is equivalent to an Indian graduate student, but the curriculum is slightly different. The president of Delhi University is usually held concurrently by the Indian Governor-General, Wavell. The current vice-president is Mr. Illo, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the British Empire. The actual responsibility for school affairs is borne by the three directors of the Faculties of Arts, Law, and Science. Delhi University is considered one of the best universities in India and is recognized by universities in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, so the level is quite high. The university currently has five colleges, including a women's college, a business school, and a law school. The other two colleges are liberal arts and science. At noon, I also visited Dr. Dodd, Director of the English Department of Delhi. He is already in his fifties and used to be the president of Ramjas College. He teaches Romantic literature in the graduate school of the university, but he is quite knowledgeable about Buddhism and has written a book on Buddhism in India in the fifth century, which is sold in the British and American publishing circles. He talked to me about Xuanzang and Chinese Buddhism. He knew that Xuanzang had translated more than 100 Buddhist scriptures, but he did not know their content. Since the Muslim invasion of India, some original Sanskrit classics have been lost. He is very interested in China. He once gave a lecture on "China and India" at Delhi University, which aroused great interest in most people. He just wants to visit China and is more willing to investigate the situation of Chinese Buddhism. I talked with him for several hours. Because I was invited by Mr. Varm, Secretary-General of the Education Bureau of Ajmer, and had to take the 8:00 PM train, I hurriedly said goodbye and returned to my residence to prepare everything.</p>
<p>After staying in Jajpur State and Ajmer Commissioner Province for three days, I rushed back to Delhi and stayed at Birla's temple at the invitation of Birla's eldest brother. In addition to providing food and lodging, he also instructed the waiter to send milk and coffee every morning and evening. I visited Professor Yangjia and English friends in India to attend the Central Legislative Council meeting. In addition to the Central Legislative Council building, the three major buildings of the British in India also include the Viceroy's Lodge, which occupies 330 acres, including 12 acres of gardens, and has 340 rooms, costing millions of shields. The lodge was completed in 1929, and the first to live in this house was Lord Irwin. When the electric lights shone at night, it was like daytime, which made it even more magnificent. The second is the Secretariat, which is the office of the central government of India, located next to the Governor's residence. All the buildings are more beautiful than the White House in the United States. The foundation was laid in 1911 and completed in 1930. There are about 1,000 offices inside, and ancient Indian murals are painted everywhere, which is very luxurious. In the evening, I met Birla's eldest brother and agreed to visit his third brother, D.G. Birla, the next afternoon to see the great industry of contemporary India.</p>
<p>Visiting Birla</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM the next afternoon, Birla's eldest brother specially sent his secretary, Mr. Shen, to accompany me to see his third brother Birla. The four brothers all lived together, and their home was not far from the Governor's residence. The house in front was where Birla's staff lived, and the second house was where his family lived. When I arrived at his house, Birla's eldest brother first introduced me to his three brothers, and then his brother Qi Birla led me to his private reception room to talk. He was in his fifties, wearing a pair of gray tortoiseshell glasses, with a calm attitude and a politician's demeanor. In addition to a desk and four sofas, the reception room was decorated with Western and Indian ancient paintings, which felt quite elegant. When we started talking, after exchanging greetings, I asked him bluntly: "Are you willing to go to China?" He replied very clearly: "When Chairman Chiang came to India in 1942, he asked me to go to China to observe the latest developments in various industries, but I am currently too busy with trivial matters to leave. Even if I want to go, it will be next year." So I said to him again: "If time permits, it would be great if you could go to China to investigate industry as soon as possible. Moreover, the heavy industry is very backward, and I hope you can help a lot." At this time, the tone of his reply was quite heavy. "Our own motherland, India, is not completely free and independent, how can we have the energy to help you!" His love for the country was overflowing with words. He was also quite concerned about the Chinese School in Calcutta that I run. I talked with him for more than half an hour, and later, he specially sent a car to send me back. I felt very comfortable living in the Birla Temple, and I felt refreshed by the Brahma bells and Buddhist sounds day and night.</p>
<p>New Delhi is a newly built city with a small population and a vast area. It is rich in modern architecture, and people feel very refreshed here. The old city of Delhi is still as it used to be, with narrow streets and extremely noisy, which is the opposite of the new capital. Old Delhi is the capital of the eight dynasties of India, while New Delhi is the political and economic center of modern India in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Looking at Private and Public Factories under the Cloud of Industrial Depression <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou News, 16th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the world knows that our Chinese industry has reached the most dangerous time. The appeals and shouts of our domestic industrialists are just a faint sound that cannot arouse much of a stir. Therefore, there is indeed a dying, exhausted, and waiting-to-be-killed spirit.</p>
<p>The common symptoms of general factories are the dumping of foreign goods, high costs, insufficient funds, and sluggish sales. The reporter visited several manufacturers and had this feeling. Manufacturers of daily necessities certainly cannot compete with foreign goods. Even some products that were originally unique to China cannot compete with them. We visited the Minfeng Paper Mill and the Zhongcan Company's silk mill in Jiaxing, and we could see the face of today's Shanxi industry.</p>
<p>The Minfeng Paper Mill is quite large-scale, and it can also be ranked among the top paper mills in the country. This factory has a history of 20 years, and all workshops, dormitories, and offices are modern buildings built with steel and reinforced concrete. In the entire paper mill, there is also a rest garden for employees, arranged as a Western-style garden, exquisite and beautiful.</p>
<p>There are now more than 800 workers in the factory, including plasterers, carpenters, coppersmiths, barbers, etc. Everything necessary for life in society is available here, forming a small society, which can be said to be an extremely complete factory. The current products of the factory are cigarette paper and straw board. They are both made of hemp and straw, which are cut into small pieces, and then mashed. After passing through a rolling pulp ball that can sleep more than 100 people, the pulp is poured onto a paper machine that is more than ten feet long, becoming pages of paper. They can make other kinds of paper, such as newsprint, but unfortunately no one is interested because of the high cost. Now this clean and delicate cigarette paper is also struggling to find its way out. Not long after the victory, Yu, Kun, Hu, Jing, and Han all came to the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing to purchase cigarette paper, and they chartered planes to transport the number of worlds they needed back to their respective places. But since American cigarette paper came, this domestic cigarette paper has been declining day by day. It is not that American goods are better than Chinese goods. According to an expert, the cigarette paper of Minfeng Paper Mill is better than American goods, but because the price is higher than American goods, under the concept that people are not used to using Chinese goods and cigarette factories also want to reduce costs, they will naturally adopt American cigarette paper because of the temptation of profit.</p>
<p>An ordinary box of cigarette paper has 30 plates, and one plate can make one box of cigarettes, so one box of paper can make 30 boxes of cigarettes. Calculated with the cost plus profit formed by the price and cost of living in Jiaxing, it costs 1 million yuan per box, but American goods come from Chenggong Paper and then from distant America, travel across the ocean to China, and after going through customs procedures, they only need 800,000 yuan per box to reach the places that need it. Therefore, the prosperity of the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing was only a flash in the pan, and it is now on a downward slope. Straw board is still able to maintain its original sales volume. The United States is unwilling to transport straw board, which is large in area and heavy in weight, to China, so most of the cigarette case paper is still made of Chinese goods, but who can guarantee that it will not be rushed in again in the future? If the tariff policy fails, straw board can also be transported in.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the factory: "The current bleak scene of this kind of depression could have been stopped long ago, but because we take into account that these more than 800 workers also have nearly 4,000 people to support, we are reluctantly maintaining it."</p>
<p>He also said: "Fortunately, we are a private factory. If the government had taken over after the war, I am afraid that we would not be able to resume work at all now." This sentence can be said to be on point. Such a large factory would naturally be much slower if it were taken over by the government. When we went to visit, it was a Sunday, but there were people on duty in every workshop. Although the machines were not running, there were still people on duty guarding the machines. So you can know a general idea.</p>
<p>We also went to the silk mill of the China Silk Company. Its original name was Weicheng Silk Mill. When we went, there were only a few staff members in the office. We asked to see the person in charge, and they said that the person in charge had gone out. We asked to visit, and they said that the key was taken away by someone. We asked about the general situation, and they were at a loss for words. We only saw the magnificent buildings, but we didn't know anything about the content. According to the person who guided us to visit: "Their style is much bigger than that of the Minfeng Paper Mill. They often take out Dean Song's big brand." Yes, we realized the difference between government-run and private, and we realized what the person in charge of the Minfeng Paper Mill told us: "Fortunately, we are a private factory. If the government had taken over after the war, I am afraid that we would not be able to resume work at all now."</p>
<p>Based on the above, although it is only an introduction to two factories, we can see the general idea. We can know that the common symptoms of factories are indeed the dumping of foreign goods, high costs, insufficient funds, and sluggish sales. But there is a phenomenon, which is the key to government-run and private. Today, government-run factories have someone to maintain them and someone to support them, but they are doing government work instead of factory work. Although private factories are doing their best to maintain them, they lack the support of the government and are still declining.</p>
<p>To maintain this little bit of fragile industry in China today, the first thing is to eliminate the bureaucratization of factories, and the second is to adopt a protective tariff policy. If our factories are bureaucratized, and all we know is how to do office work and support office workers, but we don't know how to produce, and we don't know how to train technical talents, then there is no way to produce, and we can only flow into the economic situation of a semi-colony. If we do not protect with tariffs, then foreign goods will be dumped into China so much that all Chinese industry will be destroyed, and China will really become a market. Without industry, it will be reduced to the economic status of a semi-colony.</p>
<p>Our country lacks lively and active enthusiasm! Our country's factories really need lively and active familiarity. Without heat, without power, the machines cannot be moved. If the machines cannot be moved, industry cannot flourish and grow.</p>

<p>Women and the Family Published Every Tuesday</p>
<h3 id="e171">For Young Housewives <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Xiaowei</p>
<p>Now you have entered a new environment and have a family of your own to manage. You will be with it forever, whether it flourishes or perishes. The fate of the new family depends on your actions. Here are a few points I would like to offer for your consideration:</p>
<p>(1) Make your husband feel that you are not only a gentle and virtuous housewife but also his lover. Many people neglect this after marriage, which often leads to unhappiness in the family. You should maintain your pre-marital appearance and be as enthusiastic and caring about everything he does as before. Especially when your husband comes home from work, do not bother him with daily chores, which will add another layer of gloom to his tired mind. In this way, he will feel that home is his final destination.</p>
<p>(2) Family budget and planning. In today's high-priced world, all daily family expenses depend on your husband's meager income. If there is no budget for spending, the source of income will soon be depleted. This will cause quarrels between husband and wife, with the wife complaining about the husband's incompetence and the husband saying the wife is wasteful. You should first have a budget and spend according to the proportion. Even if you want to add something for yourself, do not act unilaterally. It is best to suggest it to your husband and both agree to buy it together. This way, even if there is not enough money in the future, he will not complain about you alone.</p>
<p>In today's cities, it is not easy to find reasonable housing, but it must be kept tidy and clean. All furniture arrangements should be designed to be practical and beautiful. Maintain beautiful conditions as much as possible, or at least give people a refreshing feeling.</p>
<p>(3) When children come. Marriage always inevitably involves children, who are a symbol and crystallization of love. No parent does not love their children. The purpose of life is to enrich oneself first, then seek the progress of society, and then pass it on to the next generation – the children – so that they continue their wishes forever. Therefore, today's children are the masters of the country in the future. You must educate them well so that they have an upward heart and a healthy physique.</p>
<p>Finally, I must remind you not to forget your husband when taking care of your children. This can sometimes lead to family disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e172">How to Raise Infants? Dedicated to Mothers <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Yu</p>
<p>Before writing the main text, I must tell all the mothers in the country that children are innocent when they enter the world. Whoever kills them is guilty. It is just as inhumane for wealthy families who do not know how to raise children to often die halfway through as it is for poor families who cannot afford to raise them and drown their babies. Therefore, I would like to tell you how to raise your children here.</p>
<p>Young housewives, the Chinese are uniquely blessed. Where are we blessed? Let me tell you, we are blessed that babies have human milk to eat when they enter the world (those who don’t are in the minority). Human milk, especially from the baby's own mother, is the food that the baby brings with them. Babies do not need to digest it when they eat it, it goes directly into the blood, which is even faster than a blood transfusion. Not only is the nutritional power supreme, but it also gives the baby's body unlimited resistance to resist all diseases. However, if the mother has no milk and hires a wet nurse, this is also a hygienic and good method, because human milk is ultimately superior to everything. However, be sure not to hire a wet nurse with hereditary diseases. This is what mothers should pay attention to. When infants cannot get breast milk, housewives often use cow's milk or goat's milk as a substitute. This is almost a common view among all ethnic groups, but the protein and fat in cow's milk are not easily digested by infants, so it must be diluted. However, if it is diluted, the nutrition will be poor, which can cause diarrhea. Here I can tell you a good method, which is to add rice soup, which can obtain the nutrition of milk without diarrhea. Because rice soup can maintain the colloidal properties of natural milk and promote the development of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the intestines, milk with rice soup can make babies fat and strong.</p>
<p>Fresh green vegetables are an essential supplementary food for every breastfed baby. When babies are two or three months old, they should be fed green leaf soup. When they are older, they can eat vegetable puree every day, as well as fruit puree, orange juice, and watermelon soup, which are all good. We know that butter is indeed a good thing, just like the ghee eaten by our compatriots in Xikang, but imported products are too uneconomical; and cod liver oil is also a foreign product. Our babies need to supplement fat and vitamin A. It is best to have domestically produced butter to eat, otherwise eggs are also good. The baby's stomach cannot digest egg whites, but it can digest egg yolks. Give the breastfed baby three eggs a day, the egg whites for the mother to eat, and the egg yolks for the child to eat, which kills two birds with one stone, and there is no need to send money to beautiful packaging.</p>
<p>There is also liver, which can be said to be complete with vitamins, and there are many undiscovered elements. Do not underestimate it. In fact, liver can treat infant malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, dry skin, persistent diarrhea and other diseases. Fresh liver should be given to children more often.</p>
<p>The key thing we need to know is to let infants go outdoors more to enjoy the open air. Although there are very few open spaces in this bustling city of Shanghai, you can also go to nearby parks to breathe fresh air. Human skin is a sensitive organ. The skin is stimulated by sunlight and dry air, which can cause a strong reaction, which is the increase of red blood cells, the increase of metabolism, physical vitality, and mental pleasure. What is obvious is that the appetite is greatly increased, and the appetite is increased, thus increasing weight. Children are often outside, which can exercise the skin and increase the lung's cold and wind resistance to reduce colds. Urban children are more susceptible to colds than rural children for this reason.</p>
<p>Children's physique is trained from childhood. There is an ancient Chinese saying. "To keep children safe, often keep them three points hungry and cold." These three points of hunger and cold contain the meaning of exercise. Babies must have a fixed amount of milk, and it is never a good thing to eat whenever they cry or eat as much as they want. As for clothes, they should be dry and loose, not wrapped too tightly, and they must be bathed often and live outdoors more, so they will definitely be strong when they grow up.</p>
<p>Baby diapers should be made of materials that can absorb water, be boiled, disinfected, and not harm children's skin. Diapers should be part of children's clothing and should be changed frequently. They should be made of white so that the baby's stools can be checked.</p>
<p>In addition, the baby's crying does not mean that he wants to be held. Often when a baby cries, adults will go to hold him, which makes the baby know that crying is the way to be held. As long as you breastfeed on time, bathe on time, change diapers on time, and drink boiled water on time, the baby will naturally not cry. Empirical life education begins with babies.</p>
<p>Experience tells us that a baby's sleep is the most important thing, but sleep should be regular. Newborn babies are of course an exception. Generally, babies who are seven or eight months old must be given a fixed time to sleep. They must get a full night's sleep at night to be considered good. Do not breastfeed at night. Children must develop the habit of sleeping through the night. Older children must be forced to take a nap after lunch. Do not follow the adults and stay up late into the night. In addition, infants' diets must have certain regulations. Please read the article "Infant Diet Sheet" in this column on October 29.</p>
<p>When a child is sick, the mother must quickly ask a doctor for treatment. If friends and relatives have sick children, it is best not to let your own children visit, because children are very infectious. Whooping cough can not only cause lung disease, but also kill the child. Therefore, children's diseases cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In short, if a young housewife can follow the above methods to raise your children, you can guarantee that your children will definitely be strong and healthy.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Grape Sponge Cake <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Shu</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I ate a very exquisite dessert at a friend's house. At that time, I asked her where she bought this dessert? Why is it so sweet and delicious. She smiled and told me, "This is not bought, it is the grape sponge cake I made at home." She knew that I liked this kind of cake, so she told me how to make it. Now I am writing it down below. If the readers are happy, you may wish to make some and try it.</p>
<p>(Ingredients): Half a pound of flour, a cup of butter, a cup of lotus root flour, four eggs, four taels of white sugar, a small bowl of raisins, and half a spoonful of dry rice flour.</p>
<p>(Method): Use a shallow jar, pour butter and white sugar into it and mix well, then add flour, lotus root flour, and dry rice flour and mix well. After mixing well, pour the contents of the jar into a sieve. Under the sieve, use a large basin to hold it. When sieving, the powder gradually falls into the basin. Large lumps of powder that remain on the sieve should be crushed by hand and then sieved again. The remaining powder should be as fine as possible. Then break the eggs one by one and pour them into the basin with the grapes. Knead it by hand for twenty minutes. If the weather is dry and the flour is easy to dry, you can add a little water. After mixing the ingredients in the basin evenly, take it out and place it on a flat board, press it into a large round cake, put it in a steamer and steam it in a pot. After one point and one quarter of an hour, take it out when it is cooked, and then place it on an oiled cake baking board and bake it with a slightly warm stove fire. Bake it for half an hour until all the steam of the cake has dried, and the flour close to the iron plate has turned light yellow. Then you can take it out, let it cool completely, cut it into small squares with a knife, serve it on a plate, and it tastes very sweet and delicious, which is beyond words. It is very elegant to use it to entertain guests.</p>

<h3 id="e175">How to Wash Wool Sweaters <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>If you look closely at a wool sweater and wool pants with a microscope, you can find that its interlocking structure is like fish scales. So, housewives! If you wash wool sweaters and pants improperly or are careless for a while, the fish scales on the wool sweaters and pants will fall off, and they will shrink, harden, and become distorted. Even if it is a new wool sweater, it will no longer be suitable or beautiful, and you will have to give up. Here, I will tell you an effective way to wash wool sweaters and pants:</p>
<p>It is most difficult to wash new wool sweaters and pants, because the soap solution in the water is mostly absorbed by the wool for the first time. If you wash it quickly, the soap solution absorbed by the wool sweater will not be easily washed away for a while. So you should soak the wool sweater for two or three hours before rinsing, or add some ammonia to the water, which will be more effective (add two spoons of ammonia to each gallon of water). Because ammonia contains volatile substances, but the soaking time should only be about twenty minutes. Because if you soak it for too long, the wool will shrink again. Be gentle when washing, and the less friction the better, because if there is too much friction, the "fish scales" will fall off. At the same time, you should not rub it with soap. It is best to use soap flakes or dissolve the soap into the water after cutting it into pieces. The water used should not be too cold or too hot, and the temperature should be the same before and after. After washing the wool sweaters and pants, they must be hung neatly and stretched on all sides when drying, otherwise the wool sweaters will be distorted after drying, which is not easy to correct. It is not comfortable or beautiful to wear.</p>
<p>This method is not only suitable for wool sweaters and pants, but also for woolen fabrics and flannel clothing. Don't be afraid of the tediousness of the above method and plan to take it to the laundry shop. I advise you to try the method I said above first, because it is better to wash wool sweaters and pants at the laundry shop yourself.</p>

<p>— Xian</p>
<p>After we eat something, sometimes we feel particularly hungry, and sometimes we feel stuck in the stomach. This is really a matter of food digestion time. The following is a food digestion time table, which housewives can also use as a reference for cooking:</p>
<p>Rice - 1 hour (digestion time is the same below)</p>
<p>Roast pork - 1.5 hours</p>
<p>American rice, apples, kelp, grapes - 1 hour and 45 minutes</p>
<p>Broiled beef liver, raw eggs, broad beans, barley, spinach - 2 hours</p>
<p>Milk, oranges - 2 hours and 5 minutes Raw milk, scrambled eggs - 2 hours and 15 minutes</p>
<p>Cake, onions, cucumbers, watermelon, loquat - 2.5 hours</p>
<p>Boiled chicken, pumpkin, scallions, melons - 2 hours and 45 minutes</p>
<p>Soft-boiled eggs, pearl rice, mushrooms - 3 hours</p>
<p>Broiled beef, pickled pork, boiled radishes - 3 hours and 15 minutes</p>
<p>Sausages, corn bread - 3 hours and 20 minutes</p>
<p>Butter, roasted chicken, clams, yams - 3 hours and 30 minutes</p>
<p>Boiled beef - 3 hours and 50 minutes</p>
<p>Broiled pork, pan-fried beef - 4 hours and 20 minutes</p>
<p>From the above foods, the easiest to digest are raw foods, while pan-fried and broiled foods are not easy to digest and should not be eaten often.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Natural Beauty <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Su Qiu</p>
<p>Loving beauty is indeed an innate characteristic of human beings. I do not object to women's beauty, and I do not object to women using cosmetics to cover up their ugly spots. However, within the possible range, the consumption of cosmetics should be saved, which is not without benefit to the national economy. Moreover, beauty does not necessarily need to be obtained with the help of cosmetics. The so-called cosmetic techniques of the times are not necessarily perfect, and not only do they not benefit the body at all, but they also waste a lot of money and lose natural beauty. Here, I sincerely tell you a few of the most economical beauty techniques:</p>
<p>1. Washing your face (1) Wash your face with hot water, (2) Use high-quality tooth powder to rub your face, (3) Wipe off the accumulated powder with a hot towel. (4) While the face is still moist, apply snow cream from the lower part of the cheeks, going up to the bridge of the nose, and to the concave areas of the eyes. Then gently pat on powder. (5) Then gently wipe off the excess powder with a silk scarf to make the complexion even, delicate and smooth. However, it is best to avoid using scented powder if possible, otherwise it should not be applied too much. Because its raw materials are always a mixture of lead powder and talcum powder. Once applied too much, it can block the excretion work of the facial sweat and sebaceous glands, so that the waste and carbon dioxide in the body accumulate in the pores of the facial sweat glands. Over time, it will gradually accumulate and form black spots. The so-called cause of freckles is partly due to the stagnation of sweat and sebaceous gland excretion.</p>
<p>2. Complexion (1) Mix thin sake or Shaoxing wine with peeled apples and place them in a bottle. After two or three days, add some buckwheat. After another three or four days, use clean gauze or absorbent cotton to dip this mixed solution and rub it on the face several times a day. Over time, the complexion will naturally become rosy. (2) After moisturizing the face with hot water, apply apple dew and wait for it to dry. Then use alum soaked in water to gently rub the face. Over time, it can also become rosy. (3) Water celery contains a large amount of nutrients. Eating more water celery can also make the complexion change over time. (4) Rubbing the face with apple acid every day can also be effective.</p>
<p>3. Skin (1) Wash away the dirt on the face, neck, limbs, etc. with cold water to stimulate the skin, and then rub it with a dry towel until it feels red and hot. If you rub it every day without stopping, it can make the skin delicate and wrinkle-free. (3) After washing with cold water, apply vegetable lotion, which can gradually prevent the skin from becoming rough and maintain its natural beauty. (3) If you want the skin to change from rough to white and tender, you can use tender tofu mixed with apple peel to rub it every morning, which can make the skin tender in more than a month. (4) To remove facial wrinkles, you can use milk and honey to rub it, which can gradually make the skin tighter from loose. (6) To remove facial blemishes, you can use eggplant, cut it into small pieces, and use it to rub the face, which can be removed over time.</p>
<p>4. Hair (1) Hair does not necessarily need to be permed. Perming does not increase beauty. (2) The style does not need to be complicated, because it takes a lot of time and also requires constant tidying. (3) Hair only seeks to be smooth and shiny, not stylish. If your hair is not very smooth, you must wash and comb it diligently.</p>
<p>5. Lips Applying lipstick is unhygienic. It will hinder local blood circulation and isolate contact with oxygen in the air. Over time, the rosy lips will gradually turn pale gray. Here are three simple and convenient methods: (1) Bite open fresh green olives and rub the lips several times a day, which will naturally make the lips rosy and bright over time. (2) Mix rose water with cold boiled water, then add more than ten drops of ammonia water and mix well. Apply it to the lips every day and after a sentence, the lips will be bright red and lovely. (3) In winter, the lips are easily chapped or wrinkled due to dryness. You can use milk with a little boric acid and apply it to the lips every other day to prevent the pain of chapped lips.</p>
<p>As for other things such as dyeing nails, I will not say more here. In short, we want natural beauty, we want healthy beauty. We should abandon all artificial makeup techniques as much as possible, because the beauty of makeup is not long-lasting!</p>

<h3 id="e178">Old Papers <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, intellectuals in the interior suffered immensely, and the lack of spiritual sustenance was even more acute than the lack of physical food. The people regard food as heaven, and the "real rice" distributed by the government to public school teachers was indeed old and yellow, had been heated, and sometimes even moldy; however, rice is always rice, regardless of its quality, and it can fill the stomach. Spiritual sustenance is different: coarse rice, old rice, one can hold one's nose and brace oneself to swallow it; but bad works, articles with excessively low taste, or paintings, or melodies, one "simply" (Sichuan dialect) dares not accept! Moreover, we who teach foreign literature have been cut off from the foreign literary world for years, and we are not only blind to new works, but even revisiting old ones is impossible, because who would carry reference books while fleeing for their lives! Thus, we went from monotony to feeling depressed, and from depression we fell into the abyss of pain.</p>
<p>After the restoration, apart from a small number of resourceful people who became officials and made fortunes, most of the writing friends were "poor" and "busy," the poorer the busier, and then the busier the poorer. Acquiring books became almost impossible; but, if one were fortunate enough that the family's books in the occupied areas were not lost, or not completely lost, then one could completely "revisit the old," or at least "revisit" a part, waiting for the "knowing the new" in one's dreams!</p>
<p>The Central University Library has a considerable number of French books: literature, philosophy, social sciences, linguistics, science, all are there; unfortunately, the number is always small, there are no new books at all, and the old books also lack a systematic arrangement. Relatively well-planned and selective is still my old friend Dr. Ling Menghen's collection, a total of five thousand volumes. However, he is a doctor of sociology, so his collection is most refined in books on social science research, and the others—such as literary books—recede as "accessories"; furthermore, this set of books was donated by his wife after his death to commemorate him, and there was no way to choose, nor should there be any choice. I should bear full responsibility for the formation of this situation: because I taught French literature and French at Central University for fifteen years, I should have contributed opinions on the purchase of French books. For example, the professors who teach English and American literature and English, the largest in number, pooled their wisdom and opened or co-opened book lists, and the purchase of English and American books was most complete. Also, German books, under the guidance of Professor Shang Zhangsun, although small in number, were quite organized. Only I have not fulfilled my responsibility! Why? Because: (1) I myself have a considerable number of books, especially contemporary novels, collected quite richly; (2) At that time, I ran back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai, and Shanghai had a French Association Library with hundreds of thousands of French books, and I was a member of the association and could borrow books. But, once I arrived in Chongqing, I suffered the consequences! If the French Embassy stationed in Chongqing's Consulate Lane had not provided me with convenience, I would definitely not have been able to write the lengthy articles, later included in "The Main Trends of French Literature" (Commercial Press): "Forty Years of French Literature," "French Literature Under the Nazi Iron Heel," and "French Literature Before the Liberation of Paris," three reportorial essays.</p>
<p>How I miss the Chinese and French books left behind in my home in Shanghai! And the feeling of missing is even more profound because the French books I placed in Central University in Nanjing—including the articles I published in Paris, Lyon, Beijing, or Switzerland over the years—were bombed! Upon returning after the restoration, I was eager to organize these books: not only because I had not seen them for nine years, but also because during the occupation era, my family burned a lot of books that were "offensive" to the enemy and puppets for me. The sorting work proceeded very slowly: not because there were too many books, but because I browsed while sorting. Furthermore, whenever I was tired of writing, I would go to sort. However, this work did not give me rest: working past midnight was nothing, and once I even went to sleep at three-thirty in the morning!</p>
<p>Oh! Old papers, loyal friends! In this chaotic era, the warmth and coldness of the world have become the norm; only you, do not fawn on me because I am successful—have I ever been successful?—nor look down on me because I am frustrated! Oh! Old papers, you are also my mirror: you frankly display my previous writings before me, allowing me to compare them with my current works; progress? Regression? Or stagnation? Oh! Old papers, you are even more of a watershed between the pure and the turbid: many people, their articles remain here, their loyal behavior during the War of Resistance proves the consistency of their words and deeds; and some people—fortunately, a small number—although they made vows in the past, speaking eloquently, in the end, the fox's tail was revealed, unable to withstand the tempering of the great era, and fell into the cesspool of traitors!</p>
<p>Oh! Old papers, how can I thank you enough? You have freed me from the shackles of "time"; no, you have bestowed upon me the supernatural power to go back to the "past," forcing my unfaithful "memory" to submit. Thanks to you, oh! Old papers, I have remembered many things; especially I found the date of the first "Literary Tea Party" held—that was June 19, 1932, Sunday—which instantly relieved me of fourteen years. You also made me recall many funny things. Since I mentioned the "Literary Tea Party," let me talk about its funny story: Sun Chuntai and Zhang Yiping were both very enthusiastic old tea friends, and our monthly "Literary Tea Party" was initially published by them. Unexpectedly, after the fifth issue (December 1932), the two had a disagreement: the magazine was then managed by Chuntai alone; Yiping founded "Literary Spring and Autumn" (July 1933) to show resistance. Also, for some unknown reason, as late as April 23, 1933, "Literary Tea Party" published an important announcement in "Shishi Xinbao"; on September 1, a "Zhang Yiping Announcement" was also published on the inner page of the first volume, third issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn": each stated their own reasons. Looking at it today, the matter is so small that it cannot be smaller, but in those days, they must have argued red-faced: truly interesting!</p>
<p>But, old papers, I also have to complain to you a few times, because you have brought me silver-gray melancholy. Among you, I found a photo of me when I first went abroad to study: twenty-six years of time have turned me into a middle-aged man! In the surviving old letters, I found letters written to me by the French Countess de Noailles and the Argentine Countess Victoria O'Campo: this discovery reminded me of early May 1930, when Sir Rabindranath Tagore held a book exhibition in Paris. On the day of the preview, a photo was taken: Tagore with white hair and silver beard, standing in the center; Mrs. Noailles in pink, and Mrs. O'Campo in apricot silk, standing on the left and right: three countries, three genius poets! Tagore also asked me about Xu Zhimo! Now it is certain that two of the three have died, and I have lost contact with Mrs. O'Campo for more than ten years! Alas! (3/5, 11/21, Evening)</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Word on Poetry <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>Poetry is the crystallization of emotion, the embodiment of beauty, leaning on the crutch of imagination, visiting remote and novel places.</p>
<p>Poetry is the spark that bursts out in the long river of time. Days without poetry have neither light nor heat, and that would be unbearable loneliness.</p>
<p>Poetry is not far from people. On the contrary, it lies dormant in people's hearts. It is the most wonderful part of people's hearts. As long as you have not been defiled by the stinking vulgarity of merchants, you will eventually open it.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Sanqu Poet Huang Da-chi <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Yuan</p>
<p>During the Yuan Dynasty, Sanqu (a type of Chinese song) was popular in all strata of society, from high-ranking officials and nobles to officials in charge of theatrical troupes, and courtesans, all were good at composing songs. Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts" listed Sanqu writers including scholars, counselors, marshals, censors, and prefects; Taiping Yuefu Qinglou Ji and Zhu Genglu collected many works by courtesans, such as Wang of Dadu and Shunshi Xiu; as for general playwrights who also wrote Sanqu, it is even harder to enumerate them all. This is enough to show how widely Yuan Sanqu was circulated and how numerous the authors were. Only the short Ci poetry of the Song Dynasty and the popular songs of the Ming Dynasty can be compared with it before and after. The reason why they were able to flourish for a while is that the lyrics are simple and easy for everyone to understand, which is certainly one reason; but the main reason is that the tunes are simple, everyone can sing, everyone can compose, and once written, they can be performed with pipes and strings at any time and spread to the world. This situation is somewhat similar to the current musical scores. At that time, music and lyrics were integrated, so even entertainers could compose songs. As for men of letters, it goes without saying. Most playwrights of the Yuan Dynasty were scholars who floated up and down the lower ranks and teachers of calligraphy, but there were many men of letters among Sanqu writers. The reason for this is that drama is a spoken form, which includes three elements: Ke (stage directions), Bai (dialogue), and Qu (songs), and attention must be paid to the structure, which is not easy for non-professionals to do well; Sanqu can narrate events and is easier to express emotions, without the worries of Ke Bai and structure, and the Xiaoling form (a type of Sanqu) is very simple, so even non-professionals can engage in it. This created the golden age of Sanqu, and many men of letters devoted themselves to it. The painter Huang Gongwang was one of these non-professional songwriters. He seemed to have written many Sanqu in those days, so Zhong Sicheng regarded him as a songwriter and recorded him in "Record of Ghosts". There are many records of his life and paintings, but as for songwriting, it is only seen in Zhong's description. The author of "Record of Ghosts" did not have a deep relationship with Da Chi, so he was placed in the list of "dead talents who do not know each other." "Record of Ghosts" records Huo Chi saying:</p>
<p>"Gongwang, whose courtesy name is Ziju, is the second younger brother of Lu Shentang. He lived in Ziyou Lane, Qinchuan, Gusu. When he was young, he was adopted by the Huang family in Wenzhou as a posthumous son, hence the surname. When his father was ninety, he just established a heir, saw Ziju and said, "Huang Gongwang has been waiting for a long time." He first served as a judge in the Zhejiang West Circuit, and was involved in the management of farmland and grain due to some matter and was vindicated. Later, he was framed by the powerful in Beijing. He changed his name to Yifeng. Originally living in Songjiang, he called himself a recluse using divination skills, abandoned worldly affairs, changed his name to Kuxing Jingsheng, and was also known as Dachi Weng. Gongwang's learning does not need to be embellished; as for the scholars of the world, there is nothing he does not know, and even the smallest skills and arts, there is nothing he cannot do, and he can write long Ci poetry and short Qu poetry as soon as he puts his pen to paper, and everyone respects him as a teacher, and he can also paint."</p>
<p>The above is the popular version of "Record of Ghosts" collated by Wang Guowei. The Ming Dynasty Siming Fan's Tianyige manuscript of "Record of Ghosts" (the original book was recently obtained by Mr. Zheng Zhenduo) has many differences from the popular version, such as the opening sentence "His name is Gongwang, a native of Songjiang," without the passage "Lu Shentang" to "has been waiting for a long time," "circuit judge" is written as "circuit censor," etc. (judging from Huang Gongwang's biography, the popular version is more coherent than the manuscript), but the events are all complete.</p>
<p>The Yuan Dynasty Sanqu anthologies that have been passed down to the present include Yang Chaoying's Taiping Yuefu, Yangchun Baixue, Anonymous Yuefu Xinsheng, Yuefu Qunzhu, Yuefu Qunyu, and Ziran Ji, but there are no Sanqu by Da Chi among them, and no Sanqu by him are included in the Ming Dynasty Qu selections, so it seems that his Sanqu have been scattered and lost for a long time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I found a Xiaoling poem outside the Qu selections, which is collected in the third collection of "Hanfenlou Secret Books" "Sun's Calligraphy and Painting Notes". "Calligraphy and Painting Notes" was compiled by Sun Feng, a Ming Dynasty mounter, based on what he saw. It is titled "Li Song's Skull Fan", and the poem says:</p>
<p>[No bit of skin or flesh, only a stone of bitterness and sorrow, this puppet pulls the silk threads, playing a small trick to tease the enemy, recognize the shame, shouldn't you be ashamed? Stupidly going alone for five miles]. At the end it is written: "Made by Dachi Daoren on the tenth day of the third month of the spring of Zhizheng Jiawu, written by his disciple Xiu Xiu Wang Xuanzhen on the right, to 'Zuizhongtian'."</p>
<p>Although this Xiaoling poem is not top-notch in Yuan Sanqu, it is Da Chi's "only remaining" work. In addition to Huang, other Yuan Dynasty painters who also wrote Sanqu include Ni Yunlin, Ming Jia Zhongming Ji recorded his "Shuixianzi" in "Record of Ghosts", and "Lidai Shiyu" recorded five of his Xiaoling poems, and there are not many other works. Since the Sanqu of the two families are rare in the literature, there may be surviving ones in the colophons of books, and if they can be collected, it will also be a groundbreaking work for collecting lost Yuan Sanqu.</p>

<p>— Lv Baihua</p>
<p>Arriving in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Reducing Kejia quoted the simile of the Book of Songs and talked about how to use adjectives to beautify sentences. I thought of often using "lightning and wind" to compare the speed of something {at the same time, the actual description of these four words is also very appropriate. For example, when we take the tram, isn't it really "lightning"? On the train, I thought of these four words, but the train is not a tram, so you can't say "lightning," it should be "fire" or "steam."</p>
<p>Fire-propelled wheels, or straddling giant beasts that cross the fields, one can see the mountain scenery of Hangzhou. This metropolis that occupies the most famous lake and mountain scenery in China will soon be able to re-examine its elegance in a few minutes. After ten years of separation, it has struggled arduously in the unprecedented catastrophe and become magnificent.</p>
<p>"Look! Our plane!" Everyone enthusiastically cheered, it was Jianqiao Airport, and our newborn flying generals were constantly practicing.</p>
<p>Then, everyone repeated the luggage they had placed in a chaotic manner, and I still sat there blankly, because I had a good friend in Hangzhou surnamed Chen, and I was going to his place to go back to my hometown together. He is an inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, and now he is busy handling the county magistrate examination, and he is also my childhood friend. The reason for sitting blankly is that his firm face seems to have appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>At this time, a cold wind swept in from the train window, and it started to rain.</p>
<p>How many stops have the fire-propelled wheels traveled,</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers have not changed, recognizing the returning person;</p>

<p>— Mei</p>
<p>The statue of Li Tongmin, Duke of Huxin, Shanghai, was established in the City Temple, recalling the couplets on the Yu Dunhui Memorial Stele Pavilion in the public sports field. One was written by the village gentleman Yao Gongjing: "Filial piety and friendship can be modeled in the family, and education can be extended to the village, and it is really far to relieve hunger in thousands of miles. Good deeds are not slack, day by day Dun, diligent application is selfless, called Hui, the two words are privately given, I hope everyone is convinced." One was written by Mr. Shen Xinqing: "Only the good people can bless their village, and those who come later take it as a model. If the whole country is like this old man, the world is not enough to be peaceful." Reading this, one can imagine the gentleman's character. Now the pavilion and the stele are said to have been destroyed by thieves. I record this as an aid to those who care about local history.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>He Jian heard her sudden question, his heart was shocked, but his face was still very calm. He straightened the glass of "Victory Drink" for her, and used this leisurely little action to gently suppress the surging thoughts in his mind, not letting them show on the outside. The thoughts, statistically, are probably a string of illogical fragments: "Strange, have I seen her in Xingli?" "What exactly is going on here? What kind of trick is this?" "Looking at her resentful look, this guy's expression is not bad... No, she is simply the master of expression." "No, how can she be as innocent as Yaoqun?" "She is talking nonsense in broad daylight... Dare to use these words to test the master!" ... "Strange, why does she have this resentful expression?" "Could it be that I met her there before going abroad?" "Or a playmate when I was very young... Mizi? ... Kikuko? ... Aoko? ... Or Fangzi?" "Impossible! They can't be reborn, growing so beautiful in ten years! Absolutely impossible, and there is not a trace of the old impression between her eyebrows and eyes." "Then, where have I seen her? ... Is this really the first time we have met? ..."</p>
<p>"No..." He Jian suppressed the rising thoughts, "It can't be considered the first time we have met!" He also used a question with "吧".</p>
<p>She smiled, smiling so娇饥, so mischievously, the smile seemed to contain a sarcastic meaning.</p>
<p>"I'm very rude, Mr. He Jian!" Because I felt that I was laughing beyond the limits, "But, where have we met?"</p>
<p>This question is inevitably a bit of a naked prank, forcing He Jian to seem to have no room for retreat.</p>
<p>"Regarding Miss, I dare not say casually, on my part, at least this is the second time!"</p>
<p>"Then, the first time was..." She was overly playful.</p>
<p>"It was the moment Miss walked in... I have already admired you sincerely!" He Jian added a "slippery" to the "oil" to deal with her excessive prank. Seeing two red colors immediately appear on her rosy cheeks, I felt that I was also a bit too slippery, but the corners of my mouth still slipped out without reservation, "Not only that, but..." The words below were a bit close to frivolous, and I felt that I didn't have the courage to say them.</p>
<p>"And?" Miao asked to hear what he said next, although he was somewhat shy, but also resented him for only caring about the pleasure of his tongue, regardless of the predicament of others.</p>
<p>"And in my dreams, there are often beautiful images of Miss like this, flying from the sky, giving me infinite comfort, just like tonight."</p>
<p>"Thank you!" She thoroughly uses the way European and American women speak, thanking people for praising her beauty, but in fact, her Eastern nature makes her red even to the sideburns, and her head is about to drop. Fortunately, I caught a glimpse of the glass of "Victory Drink" in front of me, with a slice of orange heart floating on it, and a bright red foreign cherry inlaid on the orange heart, as if to greet her and say: "Drink quickly, you still have a chance to win!"</p>
<p>"Mr. He Jian," she took a sip of orange juice from the straw, feeling refreshed, and indeed gained new courage; she reversed He Jian's almost frivolous tone from a psychological point of view, as a sincere compliment. She also stood on the position of being worthy of it, and repeated the mechanical and reluctant "thank you" just now in a more natural and beautiful voice, "Thank you for your praise... Apart from my mother and myself in the mirror, today is the first time I have heard someone sincerely praise me like this. However..."</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's coffin was escorted yesterday in this city. The funeral procession was nearly a mile long. The posthumous honors were evident in general. In the midst of life and death, it is commonly said that there is a great difference, but in reality, it is still determined by the person's true contribution and true impact on society and the masses. Human feelings may be very thin, but after all, it is impossible to erase those true contributions.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu devoted his life to revitalizing industry and to social welfare undertakings. Especially for the contribution of Shanghai society, almost everyone knows. We can see from his pre-death aspirations that he wanted to run Siming University, Siming Middle School, Qiaqing Hospital, and Aquatic School, etc., so we know how much this person is exhausting his efforts to seek welfare for the public.</p>
<p>It is said that at the memorial service, Mr. Wang Xiaolai proposed to restore Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road in order to commemorate this practical entrepreneur. This method is very appropriate. What's more, during the concession period, this road was renamed with this name. The concession authorities used it to show respect during his lifetime. Can't we use it to express our condolences after his death?</p>
<p>We think that the municipal authorities will definitely consider this issue carefully.</p>

<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>In the elevator of the building, a Western woman who could speak some Chinese asked the driver: "Which floor is Lawyer Gu on?" The driver asked: "What does he do?" Answer: "Lawyer" The driver said: "I don't know". Someone next to him said: "He's a lawyer!" The driver suddenly realized: "Oh! On floor ×". After the Western woman left, the driver said: "Why is a lawyer called 'Master'?"</p>
<h3 id="e188">Please Do Not Scribble Randomly on Post Office Workers' Concerns <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bingcan</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw an article by Wen Zhenjun, "Don't Forget 'Local,'" in this publication. As a letter sorter in the post office, I feel that many people now do not follow the customary format when writing the sender's and recipient's names and addresses on envelopes. As Wen Zhenjun said, writing "Local" on letters in "Local" areas and adding the word "Local" to street names requires attention. But today, I want to bring up a matter that requires extra attention from all sectors: Nowadays, some people often mix up and reverse the sender's and recipient's names and addresses on envelopes, which greatly affects the speed and accuracy of our letter sorting. For example, American-made airmail letter sheets, recently sold on the market, can be used for two purposes (the back can be used to write the letter, and the front is printed with an envelope format; after writing the letter, simply fold it according to the format printed on the front to form a letter). Therefore, many people use these sheets to write letters. In America, these airmail letter sheets are specifically used for airmail, but in the hands of our countrymen, they are even used for regular mail, which is a separate matter. However, according to the envelope format printed on the front, there is a horizontal dotted line in the upper left corner, which is for writing the sender's name and address. The blank space in the upper right corner is for sticking stamps, and the large blank square in the middle is for writing the recipient's name and address. But now, many people write arbitrarily. They write the recipient's name and address on the dotted line and the sender's name and address in the large blank space. Some write the sender's name and address in the blank space for sticking stamps and the recipient's name and address on the dotted line, while sticking multiple other stamps in the large blank space in the middle. Some write both the sender's and recipient's names and addresses in the large blank space at the same time; some write vertically, some horizontally. Such random writing, without regard to horizontal, vertical, up, down, left, and right, truly gives us letter sorters a headache, because we strive for speed and accuracy when sorting letters. When we encounter such randomly written letters, we have to spend half a minute or a minute to clarify the sender's and recipient's names and addresses. Sometimes, the sender doesn't write "Sealed" at the end, making it difficult to distinguish the sender's and recipient's names and addresses. We even have to look at the place name on the post office stamp to determine which is the sender's name and address and which is the recipient's name and address. If we have to look at each letter so carefully, how can we sort through the piles of letters in a limited amount of time?</p>
<p>Another point is that some Chinese-style store name envelopes used by several businesses have the store name printed in the lower left corner of the envelope, while the store's address is printed in the upper right corner, which is also unacceptable.</p>
<p>Therefore, if all sectors want letters to be delivered quickly, it depends on writing the sender's and recipient's names and addresses clearly and separately according to custom when writing the letter. Finally, one more point, please also pay attention to not writing the place name incorrectly when writing the address. For example, if you want to send to "Nanshi Menghua Street" but write it as "Nanjing Menghua Street." We know that this kind of writing is a typo, but since they wrote "Nanjing," we can't change it for them. Perhaps "Nanjing" also has a "Menghua Street"? If their original intention was indeed to send it to "Nanshi Menghua Street," but because of one wrong word, we can only send it to "Nanjing" for a round trip of more than 620 kilometers!</p>
<h3 id="e189">### Can You Answer: How Many Countries Are There in the World? <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Zhengfan</p>
<p>"How many countries are there in the world?" This is indeed a very interesting question that many people want to know, but I believe the vast majority of people cannot answer this question. The reason is: the world is so big and the land is so vast that, apart from those important and well-known major countries such as the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, which are naturally never forgotten, there are also those small countries in remote corners that "do not compete with the world," which are not very "well-known." For example, where is "San Marino"? How many people live in "Liechtenstein"? Most people will be "tongue-tied" and not know what to say. Normally, it seems that there are no books about the statistics of countries around the world. Therefore, "How many countries are there in the world?" has always been a mystery in the minds of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Here, let me tell you: there are currently sixty-nine countries in the world (North Korea and the Republic of Outer Mongolia are not included).</p>
<p>The names of these sixty-nine countries are all on the map. It is inconvenient to copy them here. The following are some uncommon country "nicknames." If you find them unfamiliar, please check the map:</p>
<p>(1) Venezuela (2) Yemen (3) Guatemala (4) Ecuador (5) Haiti (6) El Salvador (7) Dominican Republic (8) Honduras (9) Nicaragua (10) San Marino (11) Liechtenstein.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Key to Peace <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Xiangzhi</p>
<p>In this era of unpredictable international winds and clouds and increasingly complex domestic disputes, every corner of the world is issuing calls for peace. On the afternoon of October 27th, I went to the YMCA and listened to a lecture by political scientist Mr. Gu Zhengshu, entitled "The Key to Peace." Mr. Gu expressed his deep regret in his tone for the unpeaceful situation in the country and was deeply worried about the open and secret struggles between countries. He explained the crux of peace, analyzed the content of peace, and was thorough and insightful, moving the audience. Now, I will briefly record the main points of his speech as follows:</p>
<p>"We need peace because we fear war. War is collective killing, war is the expression of human depravity, war is large-scale destruction, and war is the destruction of human civilization. US President Truman once said that if the Third World War does not happen, then fine, but if it does happen, the world will face its end. Because if this war happens, scientific killing weapons such as atomic energy and cosmic rays will be used extensively, and all mankind can be declared destroyed in a short period of time. You and I will all be turned into dust and smoke. Therefore, we hope for peace, world peace, and lasting peace.</p>
<p>But how can we obtain lasting peace? We don't have to seek far away; as long as we study the word "peace," we can obtain the key to peace. The English word for peace is "Peace," and this word can be translated into Chinese in three ways: (1) 和平 (hé píng, peace), (2) 平安 (píng ān, safety), and (3) 太平 (tài píng, great peace).</p>
<p>Now, let's first look at the "和" (hé) in 和平 (hé píng). "和" is composed of "禾" (hé, grain) and "口" (kǒu, mouth). "禾" means rice, and "口" means people. If everyone has food to eat, wouldn't everything be harmonious? This is an economic issue.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the "安" (ān) in 平安 (píng ān). "安" is composed of "宀" (mián, roof) and "女" (nǚ, woman). "宀" means "home," and "女" means housewife. If every family is managed and in good order, wouldn't that become an ideal society? At the same time, the creator of the character only put one "女" under "宀," meaning that if a family has two housewives, the home will feel uneasy. In short, it is necessary to ensure that everyone gets what they need, so as to achieve the state of "the old are cared for until their end, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all provided for." This is a social issue.</p>
<p>Let's look at the "平" (píng) in 太平 (tài píng). "平" is composed of "二" (èr, two) and "半" (bàn, half). This can be interpreted as "two people standing on the same plane" or "two people with one heart." That is to say, everyone is equal, lives in peace, and jointly pursues peace. If we can do this, wouldn't we be very close to our ideal society? This is a moral issue.</p>
<p>If these three basic principles can be deeply imprinted in the minds of all the world's great politicians, included in the plans of social reformers, and permeated into the United Nations, then we will surely be able to avoid the catastrophe of the Third World War and ensure lasting world peace."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Gu quoted a passage from the Christian Bible, warning:</p>
<p>"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand!"</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Government Claims to Promote National Products, But Officials are Given Imported Melton Cloth as Ration <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Lisheng</p>
<p>It turns out that the authorities are benefiting public school personnel by implementing "rationing," and the rationed items are all genuine American goods!</p>
<p>Since the dumping of foreign goods, domestic products have been neglected due to heavy costs, resulting in a crisis in the domestic industry and commerce, and even factory closures! Manufacturers struggling for their future have united and called for people to use domestic products, using "Using domestic products is the most glorious" as a slogan to save the decline.</p>
<p>Government personnel at all levels are also anxiously thinking about ways out for the domestic industry and commerce, such as releasing foreign exchange and providing industrial and commercial loans. In Shanghai, they have also cracked down on American goods stalls... etc., directly and indirectly supporting domestic industry and commerce, which cannot be said to be without effort.</p>
<p>However, there is a strange thing that has appeared in the midst of the enthusiastic promotion of national products and the rescue of industry and commerce, which the public has accepted calmly without any different opinions. In fact, it is a powerful irony that makes foreigners laugh!</p>
<p>Civil servants wear Zhongshan suits made of Melton cloth and still encourage the people to "love and use national products as the most glorious." Are the common people still willing to learn? Therefore, if the authorities really want to promote national products, they should at least increase domestic products and reduce American goods in the rationed items; otherwise, it will be like slapping themselves in the face.</p>
<h3 id="e192">It is Best to Change the Time for Inviting Mr. Soldiers to See a Show to Sunday <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Speaker</p>
<p>"Soldiers sigh in vain with tickets, the time is set inappropriately; twelve o'clock is the meal time, after eating and going to the show, it's already over!"</p>
<p>Once it comes to Friday, everyone who is busy with official duties is preparing for the "weekend." Schools and factories all have "weekly meetings," "weekend tea parties," and "weekend evening parties" to restore the tired and exhausted spirit of the week with a happy mood.</p>
<p>Today, in the "soldier" group, there are of course recreational activities following the usual practice on weekends. In Shanghai's "soldier" organizations, major theaters also give away weekend invitation tickets, which is truly a feast for the eyes, making "Mr. Soldier" smile happily.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, the invitation tickets came, a large bundle of red and green floral paper. The Grand Theater, Golden Theater, Great Light Theater, International Theater, Peking Opera, Movies, Shaoxing Opera, and Kunqu Opera are matched so harmoniously, enjoying entertainment as you wish. However, the fly in the ointment is that the invitation time is at noon, which is the meal time on the "soldier's" schedule—twelve o'clock—If you rush to the remote place to arrive on time without betraying the "invitation," this lunch must be sacrificed. If you want to "please your eyes," you can only "hurt your stomach."</p>
<p>Some people are willing to suffer their stomachs and not betray the good intentions, arriving on time, but they are "nervous" and "uneasy" because there are no holiday regulations on weekend afternoons, and they still work as usual. If, unfortunately, the official business in charge comes, by the time you return, the official rank has already been lowered on you!</p>
<p>Why, why! Spend the weekend having fun in suffering. Because there is "suffering" in "fun," everyone "sighs in vain looking at the ticket"!</p>
<p>The red and green tickets specially printed for the grand invitation to the National Army are thrown in the corner of the drawer. It is a pity to discard them, but useless to take them. You can only stick the invitation tickets given each time in a book to make a book of Shanghai theater ticket explorations, which can earn you a sum of money on the curious mind!</p>
<p>The discipline of "Mr. Soldier" is becoming more and more orderly every day, and the order of entertainment venues is also increasing. Everyone hopes that the time for "inviting the National Army" can be changed to Sunday when it does not interfere with "meal arrangements." In that case, both the host and the guest will be happy!</p>
<p>Attached is a limerick, respectfully addressed to the theater owners:</p>
<p>Working hard for five days, the weekend arrives, Thank you, boss, for sending theater tickets,</p>
<p>A large pile of red and green floral paper, The printing cost is eaten at a loss,</p>
<p>Soldiers sigh in vain with tickets, The time is set inappropriately,</p>
<p>Twelve o'clock is the meal time, After eating and going to the show, it's already over,</p>
<p>If you don't eat, your stomach is empty, Hurry back to the department to work;</p>
<p>If you happen to meet a superior, The official tone beats you like a sample,</p>
<p>Watching or not watching is difficult, But I hate the poor soldier,</p>
<p>Thank you very much, big boss, For the free spirit and labor,</p>
<p>If you are sincerely treating us, Why not change the date to Sunday!</p>
<p>A Soldier's Request</p>
