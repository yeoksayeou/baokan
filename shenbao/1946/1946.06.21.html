<h3 id="c1">停戰期限雖僅餘一日　和平前途仍未絕望俞大維周恩來分訪馬帥 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕截至今晚十二時止，停戰期限凈餘三十六小時，惟和平談判確未至完全無望之絕境。今晨沈寂兩日之寗海路五號，已臻顯活躍，上午九時，交通部長兪大維首赴馬歇爾官邸，與馬使作二小時半之長談，聞俞氏曾以關內外各地最近一週之各種動態報吿，提供馬使參考，並就恢復交通新方案中所列有關交通安全劃一鐵道警權一節，重復交換意見，據某權威人士談：政府與馬使對恢復交通一事，均具有極大之熱忱。並謂：政府已於此一方案中，作最大讓步，一俟整軍談判成功，届時恢復交通之協議亦將完成，此因依照整軍新方案指定駐區統編共軍，與恢復交通統一路政，兩者之間，關係甚大，且有其連環性，外傳政府與中共對「整軍」「復路」兩方案，曾互求保證，作相對性之同意，要求衡情度理，容有此意，但截至今晚止，尙未聞任何一方提出正式要求，不過三日前，兪部長曾談及恢復交通之商談，可望於三日後揭曉，若是，則今日馬兪之會談，當已作決定性之商討矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕中共代表周恩來，今下午四時前曾赴馬歇爾官邸，與馬使長談達一小時許，談話內容未發表。周氏已否接獲延安復電，尙無所悉，但周氏今日曾向中共自辦之新華社記者發表宣傳性之談話，略謂：舉國矚目之和平談判問題，發表兩點主張如下：（一）不分關內關外，沒有時間限制停止一切衝突，靜候調處；（二）如果國共爭端需要友邦調解的話，那只有依照杜魯門總統去年十二月十五日聲明，及莫斯科三國公告所同意的原則辦事。周氏談話發表後，據有資格之觀察家談，距停戰限期不足兩天之今日，不談實際，而談及杜魯門去年十二月十五日之聲明及莫斯科三國公吿，其姿態雖新，其企圖仍舊，其最終目的則在「拖」。　〔本報南京廿日電〕馬歇爾與周恩來氏會談後，旋赴蔣主席官邸，有所商談。據第三方面人士透露，本日蔣主席曾以仲裁權之補充方案，託由馬歇爾轉致中共，並傳馬使當晚業轉交周恩來。果爾，則據今日第三方面人士所傳關於馬使公斷　，可望以另一方式，於日內作決定性之商討一說，不爲無因。　〔聯合社南京廿日電〕周恩來今日斷然拒絕馬歇爾特使公斷中國問題之建議。　〔聯合社南京廿日電〕國府人士今日聲稱：蔣主席最近建議，要求共軍退出濱江及華北各省連重要海口在內，中共若予接受，國府即可簽訂恢復交通協定。同時，中共人士披露，如果政府軍退出一月十日停戰協定以後所佔地點，則共軍亦將退出六月七日宣佈東北十五天停戰以後所佔城市云。自蔣主席提出整編軍隊補充建議後，談判陷於僵局，迄今已歷二日，周恩來始有聲明書提交馬歇爾特使，但公衆在此極度危急時間之緊張情緒，並未因此而趨寬弛，民主同盟現力主無限制繼續和平談判。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕今日下午二時至三時，民盟代表黃炎培，張君勱，羅隆基三氏，往訪周恩來，對於仲裁權事，有所商談。三時許，周恩來應約往寗海路訪晤馬歇爾特使。聞周氏係將中共對停戰，整軍，恢復交通之最近主張，提交馬使，五時始返。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕據熱望和平之某觀察家吿本報記者云：局勢已明告國人，以隨便之方式，希望無限期停戰或有限期繼續停戰，或放寬數日停戰限期，恐不可能，因國無信心則亡，民無信不立，一政黨言而無信，則其本身之黨德即蕩然無存，一切均成欺騙矣。渠意如能在今後之二十餘小時內，做出一點成績，使和平談判之前途有實踐之希望，或可望在究成談判之手續一理由上，展開數日限期，但爲期絕不能長，此因全國國民亦不難如此糊裏糊塗拖下去也。又據邵力子。莫德惠。雷震諸先生吿本報記者，停戰限期雖迫，但和平前途仍可樂觀，吾人應以樂觀之情緒，爲民族國家前途祈福，以悲天憫八之胸懷，蔪求和平。邵力子並　語本報記者云：早則明日，遲則後天上午，即有好消息出來，望少安毋躁。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕今下午四時許，民主同盟·靑年黨·曁社會賢達在京諸人，於國民大會堂二棋茶會，招待政府代表。到孫科·吳鐵城·邵力子·雷震·及王雲五，當由政府代表報吿，自「六六」停戰公吿發佈後，雙方就蔣主席提示有關東北停戰，恢復交通，整編統編軍隊三項，曁馬使公斷權談判經過，歷二小時許始畢。第三方面人士於聆聽政府代表報吿後，曾提出下述三點希望，託由政府代表轉呈蔣主席；（一）望繼續和平商談，永絕內爭；（二）望澈底明瞭雙方商談經過，及解決方案：（三）望由軍事方式進而爲政治解決方式，實行政協決誠。聞第三方面人士定明日下午三時，在藍家莊十五號舉行聯席會議。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿電〕記者頃以關於公斷權名詞，頗有爭論，特訪問中宣部彭部長，承谷如下：公斷爲中國名詞，仲裁爲日太譯語，仲者中人之謂，吾國鄕俗兄弟有爭，請鄰居杯酒公斷。近代國際之爭，當請海牙法庭公斷，無損主權，日人譯爲最後決定權，亦殊不符。近來公文輾轉翻鐸，報紙耙載紛歧，難免訛誤，應請各報注意，以後槪用公斷二字。現在各大問題，政府正直接間接與共方商議公斷，似將行使於實施上之問題。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜本日在衆院外交委員會誦讀總統駐華特使馬歇爾將軍之來電，力主美國繼續對華軍事協助，以保持中國之統一與安定。艾克遜·陸長柏德遜，及海軍作戰部副部長雷姆賽大將，均出席該委員會，爲軍事援華之議案作證，使中國之武裝部隊成爲近代化，並使中國能履行其對聯合國之義務。馬歇爾之電文稱：此一議案中所制定對中國地面部隊之協助，將依照國共代表所同意之國共兩軍整編計劃實行。馬帥稱：此一議案之通過，將「使促進中國國共兩黨和平與統一之努力，容易成功」。電文內並稱：該議案將支持美國之計劃，促成一友善而安定之中國。馬帥續稱：對華軍事協助一事，擬之已久，起原於戰時美國對中國抗日戰爭之協助。艾克遜遜強調此一立法之雙重目標：（一）協助國共兩軍之合併，（二）發展一種有效之勢力，俾聯合國安全理事會得藉以保持遠東之和平。</p>
<p>各軍亟應歸一</p>
<p>艾克遜宣讀文吿檢討中國團結之畏期鬥爭及戰時美國援華經過。渠稱：馬歇爾將軍認爲中國各軍部隊亟應歸併爲一，此爲馬歇爾將軍工作之主要目標，渠現正爲謀取如次錯綜複雜問題之解決而工作，吾人亦希望渠將獲得完滿結果。共軍將爲無黨派國家軍隊之一部分，惟迄今共軍仍無充足之組織，訓練及配備，是以共軍領袖曾要求（馬歇爾將軍亦已同意）於合併前領受短期之美化訓練及最低數量之配備，未來數月間任何有關此項決定之協助，對整軍計劃均將有所貢獻。艾克一遜復指陳稱：按照馬歇爾將軍之計劃，中國整軍工作意在「爲善後重建工作獲致龐大之急切需要之人力，並從而撙節中國政府維持龐大及組織不良軍隊之糜費」。艾克遜繼謂此項工作如未克完成，吾人難期中國政府將有一「著有成效及秩序之行政」。按照馬歇爾將軍之計劃，目前中國各種部隊總數約爲三百二十五師，整軍後將減縮至六十師，其中五十師爲國軍，十師爲共軍，美方軍事顧問團（約有團員一千名）將爲實行馬歇爾將軍計劃之主幹人員。艾克遜作結稱：考慮中之法案一經通過，美國政府根據一九四五年十二月十五日杜魯門總統吿中所　述之計劃即將實現，此一計劃亦即「協助中國建立一足能克盡維持中國國內及國際和平及秩序職責之軍專機構』。杜魯門總總統於一九四五年十二月十五日之文吿中，並謂：「無組織及分裂之中國，將波及世界和平並招致外來干涉」。</p>
<p>仿照美國組織</p>
<p>柏德遜强調稱：中國曾特別要求美國協助改組中國軍隊，及仿照美國陸軍部組織方式，改組中國軍政部，柏德遜指出目前根據租借法案　予中國之軍事援助，將於本月月底終止渠謂陸軍部可自日本及其他遠東地點獲取巨量剩餘武器，可供實施擬議中之中國整軍方案時應用。柏德遜於答覆某一問題之時稱：目下尙未估計此項援助之範圍若何，而全部計劃，須視遠東方面最後宣判爲剩餘武器之數量多寡，及中國之需要如何而定。渠謂：統一後之中國陸軍，中國共黨部隊，僅於成爲統一政府與陸軍之一部時，始能接受援助。上述法案授權美國總統得斟酌情形，以出售，交換，租借，贈送或讓渡方式，處置政府所有供應品，唯海軍用品則不在此限。蘭西代表海軍部贊同此案，該部曾與陸軍部及國務院合作提出此項法案。海軍部且將供給擬議中之美國軍事顧問團四分之一人員，衆院已通過另一法案，規定以海軍援助畀予中國，該項法案現正靜待參院表決。</p>

<h3 id="c33">社論　政治家與批評家 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>宋院長十九日下午，首次出席中宣部中外記者兩次招待會，有很明快而幽默的談話。宋院長和記者們的問答，具見於各報，大體離不了財政和經濟。宋院畏說吃政治飯不能使大家完全滿意；這是我們可以承認的。他對於美國「時代」週刋最近「壞政府』一文的指摘，則認爲是吹毛朮疵；我們也有若干同感。宋院長並且表示，以前他因職責繁重，不事宣傳，今後願於各種集會中，盡情答復外界的詢問；關於這一點，我們尤其</p>
<p>我們讀了各報記者的專電，他們描寫宋院長前天兩次談話時的神情，宛然在目。我們雖未親　欬，而宋院長的談吐畢竟是宋院長的口氣。不問他答復的內容如何，宋院長此次的風度是値得讚許的。本來民主政治的基本精神，就在容許批評。一個政治家，身負國家重任，他的政策，他的揹施，一舉一動，一言一語，在在與國計民生有關，如果要眞心使國家走上民主的大道，政治家沒有不竭力設法接近民衆，聽取人民的意見的。尤其是新聞記者，他們是人民與政府間的橋樑或傳聲筒。政洽家如果怕見記者，避之惟恐不及，則等於渡河而無橋樑。記者們要探問政情的眞相，却不容易會到一個負實際責任的當局，則縱欲傳聲，亦必空洞無物。如此，試問怎麼會不隔閡？這在記者固然感到痛苦煩悶，而在政治家也未嘗不是大大的損失。只要常常看到美國故羅斯福總統接見新聞記者莊諧雜出的故事，我們敢說，一個政治家修養好他接見新聞記者的脾氣，實在是民主風度的起碼條件。一般人往往說宋院長有外國人氣派，不容易接近；我們却炒爲只要他有英美等民主國家政治家的脾氣，常常能像前天一樣，爽快幽默的和記者們接談，那就大有造於中國的政治了！</p>
<p>宋院長　爲現在外界的指摘，足以證明言論是自由了，批評不足爲奇了。這點認識是很有價値的！民主政治，就是經得起大家批評的政治。所謂批評政治，原含有兩方面的看法：在批評者一方面，要有不避情面的勇氣，要有探求事實的誠意，同時更要嚴守尊重自己和尊重對方的繩墨。必如此，纔可稱爲批評，政治，而不是誹謗個人。在言論自由的國家裏，如英國者，新聞自由的大帽子，並不能取消了誹謗律，就是由於批評與誹謗自有其間嚴格的界限的。在政治家一方面，要有聽取批評的耐心，要有解釋批評的智慧，而最重要者，必須有充分容納批評的雅量。政治家應該知道，批評者情感激越時的衝動，往往有言之過火的地方，更難免有涉及人身攻訐之處。政治家是否有「能容」的雅量，就是批評政治的風氣能否養成的原因。羅斯福總統在做地方官的時候，某次有一部份市民遊行示威，高呼口號要打倒他，他却站在樓上洋台看他們遊行，一笑置之，若無其事。他在總統任內，施行新政，更不知先後受到多少人的反對攻擊，他却除了宣布他的政策，執行他的政策以外，絕對沒有怪怨什麽人的批評和攻擊。羅斯福總統之所以偉大，美國政府之所以成爲民主的典型，就在這些地方表現出來。牙院長「言論是自由了，批許不足爲奇」的認識，不但批評者聽了應該歡欣鼓舞，就是有志爲政治家者也當爲中國確漸走上民主大道而興奮。政治家个一時的成敗，是小事；中國政治培養民主風氣的成敗，却是大事。我們不但歡迎宋院長有這種風度，而且希望一切政務官乃至有「一官半職」的公務員都有這種雅量，萬萬不可睚眦必報，悻悻然有「小丈夫」態。</p>
<p>最後，我們要乘便提到讀了「時代」「週刋」「壞政府」一文後的感想。魯斯主編的時代週判，原是美國不偏不倚的刋物。它對中國政局的批評，數年來多少能講幾句公道話，而在某些左傾的美國記者看來，也許還要責駡「時代」是右傾，袒護國民黨的。英文大美晚報十七日社論就在說，現在「時代」却偏到左邊去了！我們姑且不管「時代」的偏右與偏左，但「時代」週刋這篇文字裏有一句話，値得我們重視而感歎着的，就是：「除了好政府以外，沒有東西可以阻止中國共產黨走上革命的路綫！」其實，豈但中國爲然？任何政府，只要確是好的，那裏會再有革命？我們當然不希望中國在八年大戰之後再來一次暴力革命，我們尤其絕不願見中國共產黨掛羊頭賣狗肉的硬在中國再來一次武裝暴動而號稱之爲共產革命。然而阻止這絕不需要的革命，最好的方法，的確只有建立起一個「好政府」來。「時代」週刋記者喊出這呼聲，也許並不與中國人民的呼聲十分相遠。所謂「好政府」者，在今天的中國，極其簡單，第一要廉潔，第二要效率，第三要高瞻遠囑，爲國家辦大事，不與人民爭小利。「時代」的批評也許過火，尤其是它只寫到黑暗面，沒有看到光明面；然而中國今天的政府，是否已經完全做好，朝野上下一定有公評。即使宋院長也曾在參政會和中央全會裏公開說過，他對於目前的財政經濟狀况自己也不滿意，而這次他會見記者也含笑的問大家有沒有好辦法，希望能提出討論，可見他並不諱言目前的政府應該再求進步，以達到眞正「好政府」的地步。「時代」記者的吹毛求疵不必怕，最怕的我們當局的政治家不肯正視這現實。現在宋院長能坦白的承認這現實，那麽只要勇於負責，勇於檢討，徴詢民意，從頭幹起，「好政府」自可立地湧現。只要能够下大決心，先來一個激底的肅清貪汚，「好政府」就有了開始。放下屠刀，立地成佛，」建立「好政府」也不過如此。且看我們的政治家，有沒有這勇氣，有沒有這毅力！</p>

<p>〔合衆社己黎十九日電〕皮杜爾當選臨時政府總統後，法國離開左傾，已更遠一步，彼由制憲會議選爲總統已爲組成新閣闢一途徑，總理一職將由渠兼任，或另委他人充任。政治觀察家認爲情勢之發展，將以採取前一方法爲有利。</p>

<p>皮杜爾是一位幹練新人物。一八九九年十月五日生於摩蘭城，現年四十六歲，在四强外長中年紀最輕。一九一八年第一次世界大戰結束時，開始應徴服兵役，大戰後脫離軍隊生活，繼續讀書，並參加天主敎靑年運動，憑他卓異的才具，他終於成爲人民共和黨的領袖。其後歷任巴黎大學歷史敎授和新聞記者。這時以人民民主黨員的立塲，在報紙上竭力宣揚他的政見，著有「德奧合併」，「西班牙內戰」，「慕尼黑協定」等文章，傳誦一時，他堅決反對法西斯主義和納粹主義，在法國的三個左翼政黨中，他代表着新左派。</p>
<p>一九四〇年他加入軍隊服役，同年五月被敵俘獲，至一九四一年被視爲退伍軍人而釋放。恢復自由以後，便在法國南部參加抗敵工作，後加入國民抗敵委員會，被推爲主席。在法國淪陷期間領導秘秘抗敵組織，頗著功績。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕出身新聞記者戰後第一届內閣文部大臣前田多聞，今日在遠東國際法庭作證，指日本黷武者企岡使侵略合理起見，視滿洲爲「防禦蘇聯之緩衝國」。前田稱，一九二八年軍閥發動宣傳計劃，預示一九三一年瀋陽事變之來臨，此事已不能記憶。惟田中內閣之組織，乃在對滿洲採取更積極的侵略政策。一九三〇年初問，政府開始在國內宣傳，謂滿洲乃日本之生命線，必須採取更強硬之政策。其初各報反對此項大陸政策之言論，尙無明白之取締辦法，當局方面希望報紙演說家及其他人士擁護政府此項國策。厥後日本言論限制　嚴，日人乃噤若寒蟬，不敢議論國策矣。日本之宣傳計劃具有雙重目標，即企岡抵消國內之批評是也。各種報紙，，出版家，作家，演說家，事實上凡可資宣傳之途徑，均高唱滿洲爲日本之生命線，日本必須向該方而擴張勢力，開發其經濟與實業，使成爲對蘇之緩衝國。日本宣傳更曲解若干條約，謂日本有權控制滿洲，情感方面之宣傳，則以日俄戰爭時日軍曾在滿洲流血一項事實作爲基礎，因此日人有權加以控制，生享其成。其次有中佐級軍官兩人訪余，對余反對防共條約之言論表示不滿，命余今後改變論調，雖未對余出以實際威脅，但是佩刀鏘鏘，絕無辨白餘地云。助理檢察官漢莫克宣讀「順民之路」一書中數節，據前田稱，此書係一九四一年三月文部省出版，書中述及「帝國之神聖性」及「西方思想之邪惡」，慫恿日本人放棄個人主義觀念。天皇順民之最大目標，乃爲國效力。書中稱歐洲世界爲物質主義的冒險，英美軍隊企圖壟斷世界，必須解放遠東各國使脫離白人統治云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕海內外各大埠之洪門致公堂代表五十餘人，近數日來，正在上海集議各項改堂為黨之籌備事宜，並起草各有關章則。該黨成立之後。最高負責人將為「中國洪門致公黨總部主席」司徒美堂·上海方面之負責人為現任「中國致公總堂總理」之趙昱，聞該黨總部將設於首都。</p>
<p>據該黨各領袖宣稱，彼等組黨之目的，不在做官發財，而在團結洪門兄弟，協助國家建設。彼等仍當信奉洪門之傳統三大信條，即：（一）以義氣團結，（二）以忠誠救國，（三）以義俠除奸，彼等堅決表示，絕對不受任何黨派利用，一切舉措，以謀全國民衆之福利為前提。至於該黨黨員人數，據云在本市當可有十餘萬人之多，惟確數則須經將來登記之後始可統計。海外華僑之中，該黨力量特强，目前在加拿大各埠，已成立致公分堂四十一處，此外在紐約，舊金山，波斯登，檀香山，古巴，巴拿馬，新西蘭，南非，墨西哥等地，亦有類似組織十二處，加拿大尙有所調達權社（Dart　Coon　Club）十七處，亦係該堂機關，並有機關報四種，無論財力人力，均極可觀。又致公堂之歷史亦頗悠久，對孫總理創建民國，貢獻尤多，陳烱明一度曾欲以該堂為基本力量，作政治活動，但卒未得逞。該堂組黨之後，將於七月十五日在滬開會，海外各代表須俟會後始行重赴國外。</p>

<p>貨放分生產運輸打包三階段</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：四聯總處上海分處近來貨款方針，偏重於能爭取外匯物資之途。關於該方面之貨款，大致可分三階段。一係生產階段之貨款，例如最近之茶葉貸款七十億，春繭貸款二百億，使各項農產品，得以生產製造完成。二係運蝓途中之抓匯貸款，例如東南區之茶絲，四川漢口等地之皮革·藥材·猪鬃·桐油等，必須予以押匯貸款之便利，則農村物資，能源源運至都市，以備出口。三係打包階段之放款，例如物資旣已齊集都巿，且已與國外商家成立訂購契約，則在該項物資打包時，予以押款或透支之便利，使出口商能繳納出口稅及運費等。除此之外，該處對固有之放款方針，亦非一成不變，要視物價，巿塲動態，國府政策，及一般之需要，而具伸縮性。至工鑛貸款，開始辦理時，因復工工廠甚衆，故貸出款額亦較多。近因大部工廠業已恢復就緒，故貸出數額較少，惟一般工商貸款，仍視實際情形，而繼續辦理。</p>

<h3 id="c108">螢 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>在鄕間的夜裏，現在該是輕扇撲流螢的時候了，但是住在這大城市的中心區，不易看見那如點點星光的夏夜使者。</p>
<p>因為天氣悶熱，他拿了一把乳靑色的宮扇，跑到露台上去納凉。靜靜地躺着，讓心懷抒放得渺無邊際；他不去望四週城市裏的霓虹，或者那眩目的電燈。仰着臉躺下，他看着遠空裏稀落的小星；漸漸被一縷稀薄的回憶，籠罩了他的視綫：他看見了一綫綫的流螢光帶，想起了現在失去了消息的螢。</p>
<p>螢是瘦小白晰的姑娘，一副外柔內剛的性格，常常愛寫抒情細膩的短詩；她說她從小就歡喜螢光，所以在她所有寫好了的詩篇裏，都書着「螢」的筆名，別人也便呌她做螢。</p>
<p>四年前，他因為病住在南方一個離城市不遠的鄕間休養。螢因為隨着一家親戚，從城裏搬到鄕下住。那時候是暑期，他正過着很靜適安親的生活，除了稍看些書外，不做別的工作，也沒有人來打擾，於是病漸的好起來了。</p>
<p>有一次偶然的機緣，他認識了螢，這或許因為他們所住的地方，只是隔着一個園子之故。原來他們也是先後在一間學校裏的同學，所以藉校友的情誼，他們不久便除去陌生感了。</p>
<p>白天炎熱長夏的時光，緩緩地過去，黃昏的時刻也很長；傍晚的紅霞，掛在園子裏的樹梢上，好像留戀什麼似的，久久沒有移動。這時候只有鄉間小屋頂上，飄起一些嬝嬝上昇的晚炊烟影，和一些倦了還巢的飛鳥；這一切像單調而柔和的綫條，繪成一幅鄕居美麗的晚景圖；使人生寧隱靜居的心情，同時也覺得寂寞中的安祥。便在這樣的時間，他常常和螢相遇在屋後的園子裏，繞過園子，他們一同去散步，或坐在樹下聊天；彼此間的情感，隨日子而增長了，可以　無拘束的談心。</p>
<p>鄕間的黑夜，如浸入一層淸凉的絲幕裏一般，他和螢坐在離開樹下的石板上。園子的籬笆下，幾隻螢虫巡迥地飛着，一閃閃的螢光，在探照着黑夜裏的神秘；穿插往來，沒有一刻的停歇，他們的眼睛隨螢光轉動。起初他們是沉默的，像對着這螢光，各有無窮的心思待於傾訴一樣。</p>
<p>「你愛這螢光嗎？」終於她側着頭，遲遲地開始問他。</p>
<p>「這些，我不大感到興趣。」他隨意回答，但又緊接着說：「哦，我想起來了，你的筆名原來是螢，那倒是不錯」他說完了最後一句話，反覺得有點摸不淸頭腦。</p>
<p>「你不要因我亂寫的筆名，而牽連到螢光上，我只問你歡喜不歡喜螢光？」她有些不好意思，覺得羞澀起來。</p>
<p>「螢光不是太微弱了嗎？在世界上她是沒有力量的。」</p>
<p>「雖然他是這般微小的東西，可是牠不怕黑暗，也不怕暴風雨裏的狂夜；牠要飛，要放射出光亮；縱然牠被別人踏死了，在屍身上還留着牠的光芒，」她說得有些急促，被輕微的嗆咳停止了說話。</p>
<p>「可是你得當心牠的毁滅喲！」他靜靜地說。</p>
<p>「不，牠有勇氣，——這也就象徵着人生。」</p>
<p>「世間的路，坎坷多得很呢！人類走的路，不會像螢虫遊逸在無邊的夜裏那麼自由自在喲！」他的聲音就像一個病人的病態聲調。</p>
<p>「夜裏的黑暗，就像世間的坎坷，那樣可怕陰險，况且現實的社會不正是黑暗的一團嗎？在廣大的宇宙裏，人類就像一個一個的螢兒，他們要給人間帶來光明，雖然是可憐的一小點，也仍是他的任務！」</p>
<p>「那是事實，不過幻想多是完美可愛的，像一隻羽毛未滿的鳥兒，還沒有離巢學飛的時候，賴着牠母親現成的撫養，躱在安樂窩子裏，便想着自己的壯志，想着外面的藍天是多美多高，然而當牠的巢後，那便是兩樣了。」他像是專門與她為難的說。</p>
<p>「這樣，你說我是沒有勇氣嗎？」</p>
<p>「不！」</p>
<p>「那麼你是怕，怕現實的生活？」</p>
<p>「不見得。」其實她的追問，無意間已觸着他的內心，和他在女孩子面前，顯得怯懦的情緒。</p>
<p>「你是厭倦……」她還是一直追問下去，她本來是想說你是厭倦生活的，但說到厭倦兩個字後，便突然停下了。</p>
<p>很久他沒有回答，後來他似困倦地搖搖頭。</p>
<p>這夜裏，雖然是淡淡的半月，但月光從樹葉的空隙間，能照到他們的身上，彼此的臉孔也可以看得淸楚。但是隊沒有去看她，對她的問話搖搖頭後；將頭慢慢的沉到他放在膝上的兩隻手裏。突然間他站起來，茫然地望着那屋角邊簇黑的地方。</p>
<p>她也站了起來，走近他身邊說：</p>
<p>「不好過嗎？」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，仍是沉默下去。</p>
<p>「夜深了不要再受凉，回去睡吧，我也要回去了。」她拉拉他的手，便走出園子回去。</p>
<p>他望着她的背景，並且看見那遠遠的幾隻螢虫，帶着比平　更亮的光，態飛愈高起來，過了一刻他才進屋子裏去。</p>
<p>一個月的時光，很快地　走了，每當傍晚的時候，他們也常常在園邊散步，和坐在樹下納凉。他的病已經痊愈了，不幸那時候，南方的戰事突告緊張，各人已經打算在逃難，準備離開了這個鄕村，到別的地方去。</p>
<p>他為了進城去料理一些事情，逗留了一星期才回到鄕間，那時他知道螢已經隨親戚離開了這裏。他回到家後，僕人　給他一封信，這是螢寫給他的；他拆開了看，裏面只是一張潔白的紙，寫着一首「螢」為題目的小詩，在題下簽着螢的名字，詩是這樣寫着：</p>
<p>是失落了什麼？</p>
<p>在這輕寒的夜裏，</p>
<p>你仍獨自點着幽光</p>
<p>往還搜覓。</p>
<p>欲與繁星爭輝灼麼？</p>
<p>星星是終宵的閃礫，</p>
<p>而你</p>
<p>只不過瞬息明滅；</p>
<p>螢呵！</p>
<p>當你來回於我底耳鬢邊，</p>
<p>是否訴說着：</p>
<p>「縱使生命如曇花，</p>
<p>自己的路</p>
<p>還不是自己照澈？」</p>
<p>第二天，他也愴惶的離開了鄕間，因為大家都是在動盪中流浪，所以一別數年了，除了自己過着顚沛的生活外，再無法得到知螢的消息了。</p>
<p>現在他又流落在這近海濱的鬧市，夜的誘惑，和夾在凉風裏吹送來的收　機的樂曲，這些他好像都沒有聽見，他沉醉在鄕間寗謐寂穆的夏夜裏。</p>
<p>今晚夜已深了，他還是沒有下樓去，呆望着遠空的小星；他想着這些星星，就像是螢所說的螢光喲！</p>
<p>螢，螢光，人生，他連串地想着想着。</p>
<p>六，十，夜深</p>
<p>牧馬歸來，荒烟刻。</p>

<p>— 中原</p>
<p>母親是個美麗的女人。她有一張淸秀的臉孔，一頭柔軟的黑髮，一雙玲瓏的小手。她常常穿着淺灰色的衣裙，徘徊在臘梅樹下，右手抱着我，左手牽着阿姊，輕輕的說：</p>
<p>「寳寳，彌陀，媽媽的心肝，媽媽的寶貝！媽媽多苦惱，你們總要聽媽媽的話呀！……」</p>
<p>母親的聲音像深山的淸泉，潺潺地從無限的高處流下，母親的愛也從無限的高處流下，　　了，應在牀上，喘息，呻吟，痛楚和疲乏困纏着全身。然而一陣輕微的小風在窗外吹過，她立刻掙扎着坐起，伸出一隻枯乾的手，摸摸我，摸摸阿姊，成串的淚珠滴下來了：</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子！天這樣冷，棉襖還沒有做。媽媽的病不知什麼時候才會好，什麼時候才可以給你們做棉襖啊！……」</p>
<p>母親的眼淚是晶亮的明珠，照澈了我幼稚懵懂的心曲，照明了我愚昧無知的靈魂。像一頭馴服的小羊，我俯伏在母親的牀前，用小小的手掌按着母親發燒的瘦臉，默默地祝福：「願媽媽的病快快好！願媽媽給我們做新棉襖！」</p>
<p>然而，母親終於離我而去了！</p>
<p>甚至，阿姊也離我而去了！</p>
<p>許多許多年來，如一片小小的浮萍，我孤零地飄泊在茫茫的人間！……</p>
<p>許多許多年了，我在冷酷的人間，渴想着母親，渴想着母親的愛！……</p>
<p>母親啊！到什麼時候，我能回到遙遠的故鄕，俯伏在你的墓前，用瘦薄的手掌按着你墓頭的荒草，再低低的呌你一聲「媽媽」呢？</p>

<p>『唉！有什麼「理」可講？』小紅深深嘆了口氣說。</p>
<p>水熱了，小紅站起來盛了一盆，坐到屋角去脫襪子。但是脚已經凍腫了，任怎樣用力，襪子脫不下來。沒辦法叫寳鈴去替她拿了把剪刀來，這才好容易把襪子剪開了，兩隻脚紅得像染過。</p>
<p>『疼吧？』寳鈴關懷地問。</p>
<p>『不。』小紅縐着眉搖搖頭說。『只漲得難受！』</p>
<p>就在這時候，老闆娘漩風似的到了廚房，觸目看見寳鈴蹲在小紅身旁，小紅坐在熱氣騰騰的一盆水前面，狀甚親暱的樣子。這一下可讓老闆娘抓住了罪柄，大聲叱問：</p>
<p>『你們在乾什麼？』</p>
<p>『小紅剛剛檢柴回來，她的脚凍壞了，預備用熱水洗洗。我來替她燒飯。』寳鈴說着，站起來，把米下到鍋裏。心裏着實惱老闆娘那種侮辱的口吻，但又不好和她爭吵。</p>
<p>小紅被老闆娘問得羞窘萬般，低下頭面紅耳赤。同時也畏懼得發抖，這比冷還要難受以！她怕老闆娘，超過了怕嚴寒！</p>
<p>『這是你今天檢的柴嗎？』老闆娘用脚不屑地踢了踢那捆濕柴說：『這麼晚才回來，你幹嗎去了？』</p>
<p>『下着雪，看不見柴，好容易用扁槓撥的積雪，才檢了這點兒。眞的，娘！我一會兒也沒有偷閒。』小紅低聲下氣地說。心裏喊着寃枉！</p>
<p>『哼，我看你呀！也是人大心大，想打什麼歪主意了，是不是？眞他媽的天生的賤貨，伏不上墻來，才當幾天童養媳婦？就急着找漢了？』老闆娘一面駡着，一面用眼睛惡意向寳鈴和小紅掃視了一下。</p>
<p>『沒有，娘！我沒有！』小紅委屈地嚷着。</p>
<p>『老闆娘！』寳铃正色地走向老闆娘。他明白她的意思，他气得恨不打那胖女人。</p>
<p>但是老闆娘不待寳鈴講下去，但厲聲吼着：</p>
<p>『这裏沒有你的話，你還不到舖子裏去嗎？』說罷，走出廚房，狠狠釘了小紅一眼，嘟嚕地。『不要臉的小娼婦，這麼一把年紀就會勾引男人！」</p>
<p>寳鈴看見老闆娘走了，低聲回駡了一句：</p>
<p>『老不死的母夜叉！』</p>
<p>小紅氣得說不出話來，半響，向寳鈴說：</p>
<p>『寳鈴哥，你上前面去吧！別為我叫你受寃枉氣』</p>
<p>『不要緊，我才不怕她哩！你直管洗你的脚，我把飯燒好就走。』寳鈴說罷依舊到灶前去。</p>
<p>小紅嘆了口氣，擦擦眼淚，摸摸盆裏的水還熱的很，便把雙脚放進去，忽然，她覺得一陣刺心的疼痛，使她的週身像要分解了似的，她大叫一聲，便猝然倒下去了。</p>

<h3 id="c126">做過兩次傷寒病人 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 張長浩</p>
<p>我，做過兩次傷竅病人。</p>
<p>傷竅有所謂終身免疫性，一個人得過一次傷寒後，普通不再得第二次。當然也有例外。我却不一定是例外。</p>
<p>第一次傷寒是經過細菌學的檢査證明了的。第二次却是一種莫明其妙的長期　症，經過一切可能的檢査，却査不出他的病原，所以自始至終沒有診斷他是什麽病。可是照聲院規矩，凡是病原不明的熱症，往往當他傷寒治療。因此我做了兩次傷寒病人。</p>
<p>說到傷寒的治療，實在可憐。直到現在，傷寒還沒有什麼特效的藥物，特效的治療。傷寒病人睡在床上，天天在發着燒，等到病人身體裏發生相當的免疫力量，戰勝了病菌，才得停止。到現在為止，還沒有一種藥確確實實能够縮短傷竅的病程。所以做傷寒病人，必須要忍耐，忍耐，第三件還是忍耐。</p>
<p>可是沒有特效藥，並不是說治療毫無用處。相反的，因為沒有特效藥，治療尤其重要。治療的主要目的在維持病人的體力，使他在與細菌的持久戰中獲得最後的勝利，使他在獲得最後勝利以前不致體力不濟而「出師未捷身先死」，或發生什麽危險的併發症而死。</p>
<p>飲食是治療中最重要的一項，因為飲食與培養體力與預防危險併發症兩事都有關係。我做過兩次傷竅病人，對於這項得到兩次經騐。</p>
<p>傷竅的主要病狀在發熱與腸內潰瘍。發熱消耗體內養料很多，所以為補救此額外消耗起見，飲食必須十分富於營養，尤須增加供給熱力的養料·腸內潰瘍不能忍受粗糙的食物，因為粗糙的食物能刺激腸管的運動，增加腸出血與腸穿孔的危險。</p>
<p>在三四十年以前歐美各國對於傷寒病人一律採用牛乳飲食，因為大家承認牛乳營養好，而容易消化，可是在一九〇九年兩個美國醫生分析研究許多傷寒病人的經過，發現牛乳飲食缺點甚多，不合傷寒病人飲食的兩個必備條件。第一，牛乳的營　價値確是很好但是百分之九十以上是水，能供給的熱力很少，所以儘管多飲幾磅也不够補充體內養分的消耗。如此治療的病人到病好的時候都變成皮包骨顯，消瘦不堪，須經長時間的調養，才能恢復。第二，牛乳固然容易消化，但多飲後容易在胃內結成小塊，到腸不能完全消化，因此不僅能刺激腸管，也能產生氣體而使腸管膨脹，增加腸出血與腸穿孔的危險。因此，他們主張一種易消化的混合飲食，除牛乳類食物外，加入種種澱粉質與脂肪質的食物，以增加熱力的供給。自採用這種混合飲食後，傷寒病人發燒一月左右後，體重可以毫不減少，並　危險的併發症也減少了。</p>
<p>在二十二年以前我第一次做傷寒病人，那時我已經是醫科學生。可是那位新從德國回來的內科醫生還不知道這種混合飲食的辦法。他給我處方牛乳飲食，一天到晚是牛乳，牛乳，牛乳。胃口本來已　，這樣一來更是倒胃，弄到後來看到牛乳就皺眉。肚子也氣脹得很不舒服，幸虧運氣好，沒有發生什麼亂子。可是到退燒的時候，已經瘦得像一個猴子，休養了好久才算復元。</p>
<p>第二次做傷寒病人，自己早已醫科畢業，混會飲食也是病房中規定的傷寒飲食。太太自己到病房裏照料我的飲食，牛乳，鷄蛋，麵條，烤麵包，奶油，牛肉等一天吃六頓，因為味道多變化，所以頓頓能勉强吃下。雖然這次燒了三個多月，比第一次的發燒時間加了三倍·病好的時候體重並沒有顯著的變化。知道我第一次傷寒時情形的家人，看見我　次離院時的情形簡直做一種奇蹟。</p>
<h3 id="c127">傷寒之病原診斷 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 林兆耆</p>
<p>傷寒又名腸熱症，「腸熱症」這個名詞，似欠妥當；因為傷寒桿菌之侵襲及病理變化，並不限於腸部；雖然腸部的變化最顯著，並因之引起嚴重的併發症，如腸穿破，腸出血及鼓腸等。</p>
<p>傷寒桿菌從飲食帶進腸部，由胸管侵入循環系統，再由血液分佈於全身組織，尤其是網狀內皮　——如骨髓腸孤立與集合淋巴結，腸系膜淋巴腺，脾及肝等。在上列各塲合，展開傷寒桿菌及身體抵抗力的殊死戰，一方面是桿菌的繁殖滋長，另一方面是網狀內皮細胞的呑噬及撲滅；會戰的結果，決定病人的命運。</p>
<p>診斷可分為「病原診斷」「解剖診斷」「病理診斷」「生理診斷」等。在細菌性傳染病中，首推「病原診斷」。無論症狀病徵如何的典型化，如找不出傷寒桿菌，診斷仍嫌殘缺不全。反之，如骨髓血液或便尿中培養出傷寒　菌，則不論症狀病徵如何撲朔迷離，診斷穩若磐石矣。</p>
<p>欲求傷害之「病原診斷」，可使用兩種化騐方法：（一）直接的由體內找出致病的桿菌，如骨髓血液膽汁腸內　物大便及小便的細菌培養；（二）間接的應用血淸學搜査，因全身傷寒桿菌傳染而產生的凝集素，所謂肥達氏反應是</p>
<p>用骨髓培養來尋覓傷寒　菌，是最近六年來的新方法。有些醫生與病人，對於此法，尙覺生疏。其實，用沙立氏針抽出胸骨骨髓來培養，是簡而易舉毫無危險的診斷手術；對於病人，也不比靜脈穿刺術來得痛苦。茲將骨髓培養的優點簡述如次：（一）自骨髓中培養傷寒桿菌，遠較血液中容易；且無論疾病的前期或後期，甚至病人體溫已正常，只要　菌還生存於組織中，都可以找到。這顯著的發現，不但對於傷寒的「病原診斷」，帮助不少；並且對於傷寒復發性的病理解說，獲得具體的解答。（二）用同量的骨髓及血液培養，因骨髓所含的桿菌數量較多，生長繁盛，故用骨髓培養來診斷病源，可早日確定。（三）肥胖女人及小孩，往往靜脈微細或為脂肪所藏匿，以致不易施行靜脈穿刺術取血培養，在此種情况下，欲從身體組織內找出傷寒桿菌，唯骨髓培養是賴；因為胸骨穿刺術是不會失敗的。</p>
<p>有一部份人是帶菌者，以致在膽汁腸內含物大便及小便中找出傷寒桿菌，其診斷的準確性，不能與在骨髓或血液中找出相比擬。肥達氏反應更有它的缺點：（一）如上所述，血淸凝集作用充其量是間接證據，遠不及直接證據之直截明朗。（二）在多數傷寒病人中，直至疾病後期，始顯示陽性反應。是時臨床現象及其他檢騐，早足以確定診斷無疑矣。（三）過去曾患傷寒的人，他們的血淸中，遺留着凝集素；因之陽性肥達氏反應，不一定指示正在進行中的傳染病就是傷竅。傷寒類似天花麻疹等，一次感染，可產生終身免疫性。（四）晚近公共衛生學逐漸推廣，注射偽寒預防針者，與日俱增，是為民族健康之曙光，誠可慶幸。但注射傷寒預防針後，血淸中同樣地產生凝集素。尤其是在患非傷竅性高熱症時，凝集素分量增多，即所謂Anamnestic　Reaction是也。倘僅用肥達氏反應診斷，結果則不少病人將誤診為傷寒，豈不危險？</p>
<p>用嚴格的科學眼光及客觀的經騐來評判，就各種病原診斷方法中；首推骨髓與血液培養，小便培養次之·膽汁腸內含物及大便陪養又次之，肥達氏反應更次之。雖然，醫學乃活的科學；傷寒由病人及桿菌雙重「活的因素」形成活的病案。傷寒病案之不同，一若人類面貌之各異；病人對於各種化騐方法之反應，亦大有出入。是以欲力求傷寒之「病原診斷」，必廣採上述之各種方法。蓋證據越多，診斷越精密，有精密之診斷，病家與醫生，均可有所準繩矣。</p>
<h3 id="c128">傷害之病理 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 顧綏嶽</p>
<p>傷寒，因傷寒桿菌隨水或乳或他種飲食，侵入消化管內而起，由是而生殖於小腸，而入血液，致起菌血症。其潛伏期約一至二星期。局部起特狀變化者，為腸淋巴組織，腸系膜淋巴腺，脾，及骨髓等。茲分述之：</p>
<p>腸部組織變化見于腸之孤立及集合淋巴結，而集合淋巴結尤甚。先為廻腸下段之孤立及集合淋巴結受累，復為廻腸上段及空腸之淋巴結受累，闌腸及大腸或亦然。正型傷寒之經過中可分為四期：（一）第一期為髓樣腫脹，此為第一星期之變化。淋巴結充血，紅而腫，及後充血消退，呈灰色，而腫仍凸出，此為淋巴組織增生之現象。內有多數小淋巴細胞，並有含赤血球及桿菌之單核大細胞，圍繞于淋巴」結之粘膜。（二）第二期為壞死，此為第二星期之變化。腫脹之集合淋巴結及孤立淋巴結之中心，軟化而壞死，呈黃色。三）第三期為潰痬構成，此為第三星期之變化，壞死組織脫落，成為潰痬。脫落自邊緣始，漸次構成潰痬。潰痬底之小結，或有不脫落者，故其面不平。孤立淋巴結之潰痬，小而圓；集合淋巴結之潰痬，大而橢圓，其長徑大抵順腸之直軸。有時淋巴結僅腫脹而不潰爛，惟此較少。有時潰瘍頗深，致血管潰爛而出血，或致腸　穿通，而腹膜發生劇烈急性炎。（四）第四期為癒合時期，此為第四第五星期之變化，潰痬處長結締組織，成為瘢痕。此瘢痕平滑無萎縮之傾向，是以腸狹窄之貽後症，亦絕少也。</p>
<p>中腸系膜淋巴腺亦發生腫脹，有時出血，其淋巴組織，呈與腸集合淋巴結同樣變化，其竇內有甚多單核大細胞，桿菌可見于淋巴組織及其　內。</p>
<p>脾呈急性充血　大，脾　中有極多之赤血球及噬血球之單核大細　。腸集合淋巴結及腸系膜之壞死，亦見于此脾臟。</p>
<p>骨髓內亦見甚多之岸核大　胞，單淋巴細胞及似　細胞。惟粒狀髓細胞之發育，似若停止。</p>
<p>他處之捐害：傷寒經過中，其他臟器往往同起變化，如心，腎，肝，之變性或壞死。呼吸器系統之卡他性變化，腹壁及其處肌肉之透明性變化。他若中耳炎，以及腦膜炎，心內膜炎，則較罕見也。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>兩大在街頭，常常看見有掛着斜皮帶的警官在監督指揮交通，因之，交通的確改善多了，十分可喜！</p>
<p>不過我們還有一點擔心，擔心這些指揮交通的警官是否常任職？抑是臨時職？倘是常任職，應　話頭；不然，過去的那些雜　情狀，難免不再恢復。</p>
<p>除此而外，還有一點大不解處，那就是上午南京路禁止人力享和三輪　，而北京路九江路為何不禁止汽車，這不僅是公平不公平的問題，而是市政當局的一大笑話。</p>
<p>難道我們祗是要南京路舉行無阻，十分暢通，看起來非常順眼，以及有壯觀瞻而已嗎？難道我們　北京路九江路擁塞於途，車人混作一團嗎？倘使是如此，那叫做粉飾的巿政，那叫做官僚的市政！倘使不是如此，那辦法就得改正：北京路九江路禁止汽車通行，或是南京路不禁止人力車三輪車通行</p>
<p>看起來是很小的一件事，但關係到「行」，我們有要求「行」的合理之自由；也許這段話很冒凟，但我們還是提出來，有效與否，悉聽尊便！</p>

<p>— 陳循介</p>
<p>中國需要建設，需要振興實業，絕對缺少不了工程師。</p>
<p>留法工程師郝貴林的自殺新聞，我想，看到這新聞的人，不　一點都沒有感想吧！至少，在衣，我流着同情之淚。</p>
<p>我自已也是個讀工的人，當我看完這段消息時，我眼中充滿着熱淚，腦中盤旋着黑影，內心充滿着無限的憤怒，不平，和悲痛。郝先生的死，工程界少去了一個伴！</p>
<p>郝貴林光生，於民二年畢業於北京兵工學校，留法三十年，時間不可謂不長。研究汽車工業，及製造飛機坦克，畢業於漢魯機械工業學校，並曾任巴黎比斯紐斯兵工廠工程師有年，造詣不可謂不深，機械經騐也不可謂不豐富。他在法國，娶有妻子，育有子女，假使他自私一點，即使政府命令他　來，他可以有理由加以拒絕。然而受了愛國心的驅使，他離開了妻子子女，毅然回到祖國，他要看看勝利後的山河，為祖國服務。在返國之初，未始不抱着信心，以為一定可以安身，一定可以發展，那料竟會自殺！這豈是他初意所能料及的！</p>
<p>回國後，因為沒有人事關係，找不到工作，每月領二萬塊錢，那能維持生活？又悉父母兄弟在抗戰期間已全部犧牲，一時憂鬱悲憤，乃致自殺，其內心的慘痛也可想而知了！</p>
<p>雖然，郝先生是因自殺而死的，但是，試問他為什麼要自殺？他好好的生活在法國，如果沒有政府的命令，他不會回國來。他回來了，如果政府派給他工作，他也會很愉快的工作下去。然而，他竟為了沒有工作，受不住生活的壓迫和憂鬱不再願意生活下去而自殺了！</p>
<p>郝先生是死了，郝光生的死　反映出中國整個組織機構的不健全，同時也引起了工程界人士的疑　和傷心。今後的工程師中，誰能保證不會遭遇到像郝先生同樣的命運？</p>
<p>中國需要建設，需要振興　業，絕對缺少不了工程師、但工程師的地位，並沒有因為建設的需要而提高。</p>
<p>目下中國雖缺乏建設人才，但並不是完全沒有，從國外召回米的人才，不能好好利用，派給工作，這樣，即使全國皆人才，也會嘆少的！</p>
<p>中國今後將走上建設的大道，需要建設方面的各項人才，假如再如此下去，前途是不堪設想的！</p>
<p>郝先生的自殺，至少將引起工程界人士無限的同情和傷悼，以及心情上的不安寗，郝先生的死，不但是工程界的損失，而且也是國家的一大損失！</p>
<p>我們高呼；改善工程師的待遇，提高工程師的地位，希望以後不會再發生此類之事，則郝先生雖死，在九泉也快慰了。</p>

<p>— 維立</p>
<p>在上海一般的家庭中，少不了僱用一個傭人，來幫助料理家事。可是在道「勞工至上」的聲浪中，僱用一個忠厚的傭人是非常地麻煩，同時亦要招受很多的閒氣。許多主婦們一談起傭人，十之八九要皺眉搖頭，就像「談虎變色」一樣地恐懼和嚴重。</p>
<p>我家最近因母親身體不好，費了九牛二虎的力氣託鄰居介紹了一個年紀三十九歲的婦人。在每月三萬元的條件下，她做了我家的傭人。</p>
<p>起先幾天中，母親比平常更加忙碌，敎導這傭人一切家事。因為她做事很能幹，所以一敎就會。母親非常高興，大加讚美。於是造成了她的驕傲，架子亦漸漸的大了起來。</p>
<p>這傭人最恨我們叫她娘姨，她認為娘姨二個字是很丟面十的。她要我們叫她「阿三娘」，阿三是她前夫的兒十。最近她姘識了另外一個賣菜的男人，每逢星期六的晚上她就藉了看兒子的名義，回去和那姘夫幽會。一直到星期一的早晨方姍姍來遲。於是我家每逢星期日就得自己動手燒飯。阿三娘倒也很懂西洋習慣，她自作主張地造成了「星期日傭人休假」的風氣！</p>
<p>不僅如此，　還要每天晚上聽二小時的申曲才能睡覺。於是我家的那只無線電便被阿三娘佔有了。母親為了「僱傭人難」的原因就不加干涉，我亦只有忍氣呑聲。不過在暗中却和她發生無線電節目爭奪戰。我愛聽音樂，她却要聽申曲。當她聽不着時，就咕嚕：「樂有什麽好聽？貓叫狗叫似的，還是申曲有味道！」</p>
<p>阿三娘漸漸地在抱怨我家工錢少，又沒有「外快」，事情太忙，人頭太多。並且她時常把米偸帶回去，衣服亦時常缺少。因此母親就鄙視了她。而把她辭退了。臨去時大駡我母親沒有良心。於是母親就發誓以後絕對不僱用傭人，我亦極力贊同！</p>
<p>自從這狡猾的阿三娘去了後，我家變得更和睦更融洽了。無線電亦解放了；米亦沒有偸掉過。雖然母親辛苦一點，她老人家到也比以前火天受閒氣時快樂得多了。</p>
<p>我覺得在家庭中只要時間允許，一切的家事還是自己動手的好。傭人並不會帶給你舒適的，相反地間接會破壞家庭中和睦的空氣。我們每個人都有一變相同的手，為什麽要出錢僱傭人呢？</p>
<p>假使傭人們組織了一個工會，而發生罷工的風潮，那末，對於那些依賴傭人而自己不肯動手做事的主婦們，將要產生許多不堪設想的困難！</p>
<p>懶惰的主婦們！我為你担憂！</p>

<p>— 方君</p>
<p>戰爭帶來了盟國的勝利，戰爭也帶來了世界的饑饉。據說　饉是戰後必然發生的現象，但也是無可避免的事實。是以同盟國有救濟總署之設，而中國也有好幾千萬待斃的人羣。這幾千萬的人羣都是從戰爭底死神的手裏逃出來的，不想獲睹勝利之後，仍是待「斃」，則中國人底命運的悲哀，還是要從不得好死那一方求一個一了百了的解決。中國人之可為而不可為，結論就在這麽一個死字上了。然而你不必發愁，另一中國人之羣正嫌肉糜不大配他們的胃口。這幾天報上的經濟新聞不是載着大翅暢銷嗎？北菇之類的東西價格還是挺硬。說饑饉，我可在這兒看不見面有菜色的人，除非是自己，反之、茶樓酒館的生意好極了，去遲一步便無法找到一個空位，街邊飯攤却祗有蒼蠅是顧客。情形顯然與戰時不同，戰時的市民惟有向飯攤祭一下子五臟廟。由於上面的說法，可以知道中國人自有他的「優生」，僅僅是不爭氣（？）的人　會迫到死亡綫上去。——我真不是在這兒說輕鬆的話兒。</p>
<p>但，饑饉在世界上已成了普遍的現象實是毌庸否認的，所以外國的闊人們都張大們在呼號，要大家節食。這兒今日各色各樣的報紙都跟着在社　上或特稿上做了一回應聲虫，大家還規定今日是節食日，節食下來的米糧防止眼前利未來的饑饉，不過，這些節食下來的米糧要火家存放在自己的家裏呢？還是捐給一個散賑的機關去？大家都沒有提議，報紙也沒有下文。想來是要大家節食存糧了，待斃的人們讓他去待斃。因　待斃的人們不祗「待斃」呢，而且簡直是該死！？</p>
<p>從實地的觀察，這兒的節食日到底節下多少來？誰也不能吿訴誰的，為的是巿場擁擠的情形並不曾有一分一毫的减少，早午晚三巿的茶樓，餐室和菜館照例仍是座無隙地，除了跟在人們身後的呌化，任誰也是腹滿腸肥，連一滴水也不曾節省下來，可知今日的節食日怕祗有提倡者省下兩塊麵包，其餘的芸衆生總不有减低一下他們「食色性也」了，這眞寃枉了各報做了這一回應聲虫，聲應了出來人家常他是狗吠。</p>

<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>香港星東足球隊與靑白比賽的背後，還有一段秘聞。星東隊這次來上海，除了比賽之外、還想拉攏幾個角色、同到澳洲去遠征一番。因　上海靑白隊，過去在香港都是東方隊人物，說起來原是自家人，所以運次兩隊頗有重新合流的意思。經過幾次談判，雙方以意見各異，始終未能合拍。原來星東隊以來滬四戰，無往不利，認為該居主動地位，祗想在靑白隊中挑選四人，做做配角。而靑白　認為自身實力强硬，堅持要參加六人。在局外人看起來，四人與六人似乎沒有大分別，原來在他們的黨思，此中却大有道理，因為一個足球隊的正式陣容、祗有十一人，如果靑白隊能够佔居六席，無形中佔居了主動地位；所以星東隊當時不肯答應，原因亦就在此。同時主角與配角，對於整個支配方面，不論比賽與經費，明知道此中大有進出、自然誰亦不想吃虧。雙方旣然都是「寡婦養孩子」——「老手」，常然很容易成了僵局。可是事情的進展、亦並不像理想中的那樣就此「拆台」，到底遠征澳洲去的好事情，大家都感到濃厚興趣。因此最後的談判，就决定以是青大戰，作為分配人數的標準。即是說：青白　了，　　　　出席，否。則去四人。所以前天的比賽，　方都特別賣命，就有那麽一點小道理在。結果青白果然以三比一壓倒星東，造成絕對優勢，故由此預料，今後遠征漢洲的名單，靑白隊將可佔居一個比較優異的地位，亦可以說，這是靑白隊的汗水勞力換來的勝利。</p>

<p>最近中央銀行大竊案，因為警務當局四出偵査，歷久未獲主犯、連日該行便在各報大登通緝廣吿，這一筆費用，相當可觀；雖然銀行方面有理由出帳，可以作正開支，但此案旣已報由治安當局辦理，那末這一筆可觀的廣吿費支出，究竟應由那一方面負責比較最合理？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Despite Only One Day Remaining in the Ceasefire, Hope for Peace Remains: Yu Ta-wei and Zhou Enlai Separately Visit Marshal <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] As of 12:00 midnight tonight, only thirty-six hours remain in the ceasefire period, but peace negotiations have not reached a completely hopeless situation. This morning, No. 5 Ninghai Road, which had been quiet for two days, showed significant activity. At 9:00 a.m., Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei first visited Marshal Marshall's residence for a two-and-a-half-hour discussion. It is reported that Mr. Yu provided Marshal Marshall with reports on various developments in and outside the Pass (關內關外) over the past week for reference, and reiterated the exchange of views on the clause regarding the unified railway police authority in the new transportation restoration plan concerning transportation safety. According to an authoritative source, both the government and Marshal Marshall are very enthusiastic about restoring transportation. It is also said that the government has made the greatest concessions in this plan. Once the troop reorganization negotiations are successful, the agreement on restoring transportation will also be completed. This is because designating garrison areas for the reorganized and integrated Communist troops in accordance with the new troop reorganization plan and unifying road administration for transportation restoration are closely related and have a chain reaction. It is rumored that the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had sought mutual guarantees for the "troop reorganization" and "road restoration" plans, seeking relative agreement. It is possible that there was such intent. However, as of tonight, there has been no formal request from either side. However, three days ago, Minister Yu mentioned that the negotiations on restoring transportation were expected to be announced in three days. If so, then today's meeting between Marshall and Yu must have made a decisive discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Marshall's residence before 4:00 p.m. today for a lengthy discussion of about one hour. The content of the conversation was not released. It is not yet known whether Mr. Zhou has received a reply telegram from Yan'an, but Mr. Zhou today issued a propagandistic statement to the CCP's own Xinhua News Agency, stating briefly: Regarding the peace negotiation issue that is attracting national attention, two propositions are put forward as follows: (1) Regardless of inside or outside the Pass, all conflicts should cease without time limit, pending mediation; (2) If the Kuomintang-Communist dispute requires mediation by friendly nations, it should only be handled in accordance with President Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the principles agreed upon in the Moscow Three-Nation Announcement. After Mr. Zhou's statement was released, qualified observers stated that today, less than two days before the ceasefire deadline, he did not talk about practicalities but about Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the Moscow Three-Nation Announcement. Although his posture is new, his intentions remain the same, and his ultimate goal is to "delay". [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] After the meeting with Mr. Zhou Enlai, Marshal Marshall went to Chairman Chiang's residence for discussions. According to sources from the Third Party, Chairman Chiang entrusted Marshal Marshall today with a supplementary plan for the arbitration right to be forwarded to the CCP, and it is said that Marshal Marshall delivered it to Zhou Enlai that evening. If so, then the saying circulating among Third Party figures today that Marshal Marshall's arbitration can be expected to be decided decisively within a few days in another way is not without cause. [United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Zhou Enlai today flatly rejected Special Envoy Marshall's suggestion to arbitrate the China issue. [United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Government officials stated today that Chairman Chiang recently suggested that the Communist troops withdraw from Binjiang and important seaports in the provinces of North China. If the CCP accepts this, the government can sign an agreement to restore transportation. At the same time, CCP officials disclosed that if government troops withdraw from the locations occupied after the January 10th ceasefire agreement, then the Communist troops will also withdraw from the cities occupied after the June 7th announcement of the fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast. Since Chairman Chiang put forward supplementary suggestions for reorganizing the army, the negotiations have been in a deadlock for two days. Zhou Enlai finally submitted a statement to Special Envoy Marshall, but the public's tense mood at this extremely critical time has not been eased as a result. The Democratic League is now advocating for the continuation of peace talks without restrictions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] From 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. today, Democratic League representatives Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai, and Luo Longji visited Zhou Enlai to discuss the issue of arbitration rights. Around 3:00 p.m., Zhou Enlai went to Ninghai Road to meet with Special Envoy Marshall by appointment. It is said that Mr. Zhou submitted to Marshal Marshall the CCP's latest propositions on ceasefire, troop reorganization, and transportation restoration and returned at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Shao Lizi Tells Reporters: Good News Must Come Today or Tomorrow; Democratic League Youth and Social Figures Hosted Government Representatives in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] According to an observer who is eager for peace, who told our reporter: The situation has clearly told the people that it is impossible to hope for an indefinite ceasefire or a limited extension of the ceasefire, or to relax the ceasefire deadline by a few days in a casual manner, because a country without faith will perish, and people without faith cannot stand. If a political party is untrustworthy, then its own party morality will be lost, and everything will become deception. In his opinion, if some progress can be made in the next twenty-odd hours to give practical hope for the future of peace negotiations, it may be possible to extend the deadline for a few days on the grounds of completing the negotiation procedures, but the period must not be long, because the national people will not easily drag on in such a muddled way. Furthermore, according to Mr. Shao Lizi, Mo Dehui, and Lei Zhen, who told our reporter that although the ceasefire deadline is approaching, the prospect of peace is still optimistic. We should pray for the future of the nation and the country with an optimistic mood, and seek peace with a compassionate heart. Shao Lizi also told our reporter: Good news will come out as early as tomorrow, and as late as the morning after tomorrow. Please be patient.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] At about 4:00 p.m. today, the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures in Nanjing hosted government representatives at a tea party in the National Assembly Hall. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and Wang Yunwu attended. The government representatives reported on the negotiations on the three items suggested by Chairman Chiang related to the Northeast ceasefire, transportation restoration, and troop reorganization and integration, as well as Marshal Marshall's arbitration rights, which lasted for about two hours. After listening to the report of the government representatives, third-party figures put forward the following three hopes, entrusted to the government representatives to submit to Chairman Chiang: (1) Hope to continue peace negotiations and eliminate internal strife forever; (2) Hope to thoroughly understand the negotiation process and solutions between the two parties; (3) Hope to move from military methods to political solutions and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). It is said that third-party figures are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at No. 15 Lanjiazhuang at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.</p>

<p>[United Press Peiping Dispatch, 20th] The Peiping Office of the Central Propaganda Department announced today that Guo Zheyuan (transliteration), a major and the government representative of the tenth executive group of the Military Mediation Executive Department, was killed by the Communist Party yesterday en route from Xinxiang to Xiuwu.

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Recently, regarding the term arbitration right, there has been considerable controversy. The reporter specially visited Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department, who explained as follows: Public judgment is a Chinese term, while arbitration is a Japanese translation. "Zhong" means a middleman. In our country's customs, when brothers have a dispute, they ask neighbors to settle the matter with a drink and public judgment. In modern international disputes, the Hague Tribunal should be asked for public judgment, which does not harm sovereignty. The Japanese translated it as the final decision-making power, which is also inconsistent. Recently, official documents have been translated back and forth, and newspaper reports have been inconsistent, which inevitably leads to errors. All newspapers should pay attention and use the term "public judgment" from now on. Currently, the government is directly and indirectly discussing public judgment with the Communist Party on major issues, which seems to be the issue of implementation.</p>

<p>[United Press Peiping Dispatch, 20th] The government group of the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department requested appropriate punishment for the illegal fabrication of propaganda by Kuang Hua (transliteration), the head of the Communist Party News Release Group of the department.

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department answered reporters' inquiries on the current situation of peace negotiations on the 20th as follows: "Various issues have been fully exchanged, and are quite detailed, but several important issues have not been resolved. Marshal Marshall and government representatives will make special efforts today and tomorrow to obtain the consent of the Joint Communist Party. The transportation issue seems easier to resolve, but the issue of troop reorganization and integration, and the garrison areas of the Communist troops has not yet been decided. The ceasefire period is about to expire. We sincerely hope that the Communist Party will respond to the government's concessions so that an agreement can be reached to comfort the public's expectations."</p>

<p>[US News Agency Washington, 19th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson read a cable from President's Special Envoy to China General Marshall to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, vigorously advocating that the United States continue to provide military assistance to China to maintain China's unity and stability. Acheson, Army Secretary Patterson, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ramsey all attended the committee to testify on the military aid to China bill to modernize China's armed forces and enable China to fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. Marshall's cable stated that the assistance to China's ground forces stipulated in this bill will be implemented in accordance with the troop reorganization plan agreed upon by the Kuomintang and Communist Party representatives. Marshall said that the passage of this bill will "make efforts to promote peace and unification between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China easier to succeed". The cable also stated that the bill will support the US plan to promote a friendly and stable China. Marshall continued that military assistance to China has been planned for a long time, originating from the US assistance to China in the War of Resistance Against Japan during the war. Acheson emphasized the dual objectives of this legislation: (1) to assist the merger of the Kuomintang and Communist armies, and (2) to develop an effective force so that the United Nations Security Council can use it to maintain peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>All Armies Should Urgently Be Unified</p>
<p>Acheson read a statement reviewing China's difficult struggle for unity and the wartime US aid to China. He said that General Marshall believes that all Chinese army units should urgently be merged into one. This is the main goal of General Marshall's work. He is currently working to seek solutions to such complex problems, and we hope that he will achieve satisfactory results. The Communist army will be part of a non-partisan national army, but so far the Communist army still lacks sufficient organization, training and equipment. Therefore, the Communist army leaders have requested (and General Marshall has also agreed) to receive short-term US training and a minimum amount of equipment before the merger. Any assistance related to this decision in the coming months will contribute to the troop reorganization plan. Acheson further pointed out that according to General Marshall's plan, China's troop reorganization work is intended to "obtain the vast and urgent manpower needed for post-reconstruction work, and thereby save the Chinese government from maintaining the waste of a huge and poorly organized army". Acheson continued that if this work cannot be completed, we can hardly expect the Chinese government to have an "effective and orderly administration". According to General Marshall's plan, the total number of various troops in China is currently about 325 divisions. After the troop reorganization, it will be reduced to 60 divisions, of which 50 divisions will be the National Army and 10 divisions will be the Communist Army. The US military advisory group (with about 1,000 members) will be the main personnel for implementing General Marshall's plan. Acheson concluded that once the bill under consideration is passed, the US government will implement the plan mentioned in President Truman's statement on December 15, 1945. This plan is also "to assist China in establishing a military agency capable of fulfilling its responsibilities for maintaining domestic and international peace and order in China." In his statement on December 15, 1945, President Truman also said: "An unorganized and divided China will affect world peace and invite foreign interference."</p>
<p>Organized Like the United States</p>
<p>Patterson emphasized that China has specifically requested the United States to assist in reorganizing the Chinese army and reorganizing the Chinese Ministry of Military Affairs in accordance with the organization of the US Army Department. Patterson pointed out that the military assistance currently provided to China under the Lend-Lease Act will end at the end of this month. He said that the Army Department can obtain a large amount of surplus weapons from Japan and other Far East locations, which can be used for the implementation of the proposed China troop reorganization plan. Patterson said in response to a question that the scope of this assistance has not yet been estimated, and the entire plan depends on the quantity of surplus weapons finally declared in the Far East and China's needs. He said that the unified Chinese army and the Chinese Communist troops can only receive assistance when they become part of the unified government and army. The above bill authorizes the President of the United States to dispose of government-owned supplies by means of sale, exchange, lease, gift, or transfer, as he deems appropriate, except for naval supplies. Lanxi, representing the Navy Department, agreed to the proposal. The department had cooperated with the Army Department and the State Council to propose the bill. The Navy Department will also provide one-fourth of the personnel of the proposed US military advisory group. The House has passed another bill stipulating naval aid to China, which is currently awaiting a vote in the Senate.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming arrived in Beijing on the 20th at 1:30 p.m. by the Beijing-Shanghai train and is scheduled to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang within days to report on the situation. The reporter visited Ambassador Wei at his residence. Wei said: The US-China loan issue is not yet at the stage of announcement. Regarding the US government and public's views on our country, he said: Most are friendly, but criticism is unavoidable. A small number of criticisms are also due to lack of clear understanding of the facts. Regarding the current international situation, the ambassador emphasized that the Four-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference currently being held in Paris is very important and is the key to resolving current international disputes. When the reporter asked about the rumors that he would take up a new position, Wei replied in a humorous tone: Various rumors are still news to me.

<h3 id="e12">Bell Nas Once Proposed a Bill to Help Our Country Train Troops <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 19th] US Secretary of State Bell Nas submitted a bill to Congress before his trip to Paris to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which will have a significant impact on China. The bill proposed by Bell stipulated that the United States would assist China in forming a modern army of one million people. According to the agreement of January 10 this year, there will be 50 divisions of the National Army and 10 divisions of the Communist Army. At that time, an agreement was also reached on a ceasefire, but it has been broken. This bill will implement the US side's obligations in the agreement, which was originally based on the possibility of complying with the ceasefire. However, according to United Press reporter Hai Taohua's telegram from Washington: "Officials here expect the plan to build a modern Chinese army to be implemented regardless of whether peaceful negotiations are successful. Generally, it is believed that if negotiations fail, the United States will have no other way than to fully support Chairman Chiang in building a strong China."</p>
<h3 id="e13">Communist Army Resorts to All Means to Create Terrorist Incidents: Deputy Commissioner of the Communist Party Security Bureau Discloses Conspiracy in an Open Letter <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] A month ago, the Peiping Garrison Command received a letter from Ye Jianying of the Chinese Communist Party, saying that the car of CCP representative Song Shilun was shot. Generally, people have doubts about the inside story of this incident. Recently, relevant parties suddenly received a confidential letter. The sender was Song Chun, deputy commissioner of the Communist Party (Security) Bureau. The place of dispatch was No. 11 Qianjingji Road, Peiping. Song explained in the letter that he joined the Communist Party in 1931. In March of this year, he was ordered by the Central Political Security Bureau of the Communist Party to work in Peiping with Teng Daiyuan, Ye Jianying's military advisor. He was then instructed by the Chinese Communist Party in May to create terrorist incidents in Peiping. He did not think so. On Labor Day, he sent letters exposing such terrorist conspiracies of the Chinese Communist Party to the World Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Tianjin Minguo Daily, and China New Northern Daily, requesting disclosure. However, none of the newspapers published them. When the incident of Song Shilun's car being shot was reported, he then sent a confidential letter to relevant parties on May 19, requesting that the letters previously sent to various newspapers be examined and published. In his letter to various newspapers, he said: "The purpose of my publicizing this matter is for the peace and stability of the Chinese people, and for the revolutionary interests of my party, my army, and the proletariat. I am not violating the party, nor am I surrendering to other classes. I am still willing to be a Bolshevik, but objectively, I may not be understood by the party. I am willing to sacrifice myself for this and realize my correct position. After arriving in Peiping, I did see what the people are asking for. The people are asking for peace, democracy, and stability. And my party's policy is also moving in this direction, but I encountered difficulties. In such a calm Peiping environment, we felt that the progress of our work was slow and difficult. Therefore, I was instructed to create a serious incident to stimulate society and create a tense and active situation, so that we could take the opportunity to carry out our work. The higher authorities ordered that we should arrange a few terrorist activities in various gatherings, that is, kill a few comrades of our party and social celebrities, and create a massacre so that we could frame others (Comrade Li Zhaolin was sacrificed under this strategy). But I firmly oppose this practice. I believe that the current international and domestic situation is favorable to us. If we firmly support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and unite with the democratic government, it is possible to achieve it. Why use such improper tactics? Why sacrifice a few comrades who have struggled hard without cause? I raised my objections to the higher authorities, but the higher authorities were unwilling to accept them and strictly criticized me, saying that I was right-leaning. I am not opposed to the entire line of the party, but I want to correct the erroneous style of some leaders." (His second letter, which was sent on May 19) said: "Do you know what happened to the shooting of CCP representative Song Shilun? I think you stupid guys will never know. Such things are just the beginning, and they will continue to happen in the future. Why don't you go and explore? I once sacrificed my position and revealed this matter in advance on May 1. On May 1, I wrote an open letter and sent it to the World Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Tianjin Minguo Daily, and North China Daily to publicize the political reasons for the assassination to the society. I thought it could prevent this kind of thing from happening, but unexpectedly, the newspapers were too prejudiced and unwilling to publish a letter from a Communist. As a result, the Song Shilun incident still occurred. Looking at the above, the contents of the two letters are enough to prove the Communist Party's despicable and shamelessness, resorting to all means to create terrorist incidents in an attempt to frame others. And the truth about the Song Shilun shooting incident can be fully revealed to the public.</p>

<p>[Taiyuan, 20th] Today marks the twelfth day of the ceasefire. The period of peace in the Northeast only has thirty-six hours remaining. However, at the Peiping Union Medical College, the command center for peace negotiations, there is still not a single piece of good news to offer solace. Today, this reporter visited an official in charge and inquired about whether any agreement had been received from Nanjing, and about six or seven different questions, including whether the ceasefire would be extended. All the replies received were "Unknown!" However, the spokesperson emphasized that the communist forces' offensive in North China has almost fully commenced recently. The offensive in Shandong started on June 6th. The offensive in Shanxi started on June 10th. Currently, the Niangziguan Tunnel on the Zhengtai Railway has been blown up, and the railway leading to Shouyang has also been destroyed. After the communist forces in northern Shanxi occupied Shuoxian, they severed the Datong-Taiyuan Railway. In southern Shanxi, it is reported that Wenxi has fallen, Quwo and Jiangxian are besieged, and the railway between Linfen and Wenxi has also been destroyed. The provincial capital Taiyuan is now isolated. In Rehe, the communist forces in Lingyuan and Yebaishou have also launched an offensive. This reporter visited the CCP News Office of the Executive Headquarters. They showed me a telegram of over four thousand words from all members of the CCP groups of the Executive Headquarters (protesting the arrest and abuse of CCP personnel by local government troops). They did not make any further comments on the current situation. From nightfall, huge transport planes passed frequently overhead, seemingly without stopping for a moment. The red and green lights on the wings of the night-flying planes were almost indistinguishable from the scattered stars. The people of the ancient capital looked up to the sky in melancholy, and no one could predict whether the visitor in thirty-six hours would be the god of war or a white dove of peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th] For the past week, Jinan has been filled with a wartime atmosphere. This is the inevitable result of the communist forces gradually approaching Jinan and beginning to besiege it. At midnight and in the early morning, citizens can listen intently to the faint sounds of artillery fire coming from the suburbs, sometimes mixed with continuous gunfire. The garrison troops at the bridgeheads are directing civilians to rush to build defensive fortifications and erect barbed wire fences. This measure is more akin to preparing for urban unrest than preparing for street fighting, because the suburban defenses are extremely solid. However, due to the ceasefire agreement, there are probably some dangerous elements lurking in the area. Citizens do not seem surprised by these preparations. A curfew is imposed every night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 20th] The second phase of the government's military reorganization will be completed by the end of this month. By then, eighteen armies will have been reorganized. The military reorganization in the Peiping and Tianjin area is included in the second phase. If the conflicts in North China do not stop completely, it may be difficult to proceed as scheduled. When the entire military reorganization is completed in the future, after all the armies are reorganized into divisions, the government will abolish all high-level command headquarters above the army level. They will all be under the direct command of the Chief of the General Staff. As for local military administration, it will be handled by military regions. The authorities previously planned to divide the entire country into forty-two military regions, representing the Ministry of National Defense to implement conscription, training, and supply matters.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense believes that the established plan for military reorganization and demobilization should be implemented quickly to demonstrate the government's determination to seek peaceful unification. Considering that various troops have moved around to various places due to the War of Resistance, and that there are many cases of substitutes filling in, in order to improve conscription and protect conscripted soldiers, Military Affairs Officer Ouyang of the Military Affairs Bureau was specially dispatched to various places to verify the stationed troops. After completing the verification work of the Kunshan garrison, Ouyang, accompanied by Section Chief Zhou Shuwu of the Military Affairs Section, arrived in Suzhou yesterday and has now begun the verification work of the 145th Brigade. This reporter made a special visit to him and was told about the mission. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Those who are old and infirm should be discharged and returned to their hometowns. (2) Demobilization and retirement: All volunteers who have been approved to return to their hometowns and who have the conditions for changing careers should be allowed to change careers. (3) The names and registrations of soldiers retained in the camp must be accurate as a basis for improving conscription. (4) In addition to receiving a retirement allowance based on their years of service, all travel expenses and rations for demobilized and retired soldiers will be borne by the government.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Hoping the CCP Will Change Its Style to Achieve Peaceful Unification; Chu Fucheng Discusses His Views on the Current Situation <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Councilor Chu Fucheng has been working tirelessly for national affairs for many years, calling for peaceful unification. This reporter made a special trip to his private residence yesterday to inquire about his views on the current situation. He said: Although the fifteen-day deadline for the ceasefire is approaching, all issues can still be discussed and continued through negotiations. Currently, everyone should be mindful of the suffering of the people and the economic crisis, so that all parties can have the opportunity to reach a peaceful resolution, rather than resorting to armed conflict. Speaking of the Northeast and Southern Shandong incidents, Chu believes that the Northeast issue arose because the government failed to immediately incorporate the local armed forces at the beginning of the takeover, which allowed the CCP to take advantage of it. Most of the 400,000 troops claimed by the CCP in the Northeast were actually puppet troops and underground armed forces such as the Northeast Volunteer Army. If the government had properly dealt with these armed forces in advance, the takeover of the Northeast would not have had so many complications. However, even so, in the future, the Northeast will still have unified administrative power like other provinces and will not be divided in its organization. As for the Southern Shandong incident, I believe that the CCP army would never disregard the feelings of the American army and attack Jinan and Qingdao. When the reporter asked about his opinions on relieving the suffering of the people in the "Soviet-Lu-Wan Border Region" and other CCP "liberated areas," Chu said: In the above-mentioned areas, the displaced people are indeed full of complaints and unable to return to their hometowns. For example, the [original text] policy in the "liberated areas" of northern Jiangsu really makes it impossible for the common people to survive. But based on my speculation, the "Soviet-Lu-Wan" troops of the CCP may be untrained troops, resulting in this. If peace is achieved, no matter what, third-party figures must ask the CCP to make practical changes to the style of the "liberated areas" so that the common people will no longer be displaced. When the National Assembly is convened in the future, I will also faithfully advise the CCP to change its style. Finally, when the reporter asked about his opinions on the nationalization of the military, he said: The fact that the CCP has its own army is a temporary phenomenon. In the future, the CCP must completely give up its armed forces in order to achieve thorough democratic politics. The first step is to reorganize the troops. Both the government and the CCP have armed forces. The second step is to achieve a unified reorganization, and the national army will be completely unified under unified command. The CCP will not have privately owned armed forces. Cooperating with the CCP's proposed "political democratization" proposal and discussing a detailed plan will lead to the successful achievement of the hope of unification and democracy.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] This reporter recently visited Director Jiang of the Executive Headquarters and inquired about the transportation of relief supplies to various places. According to him, from December of last year to May of this year, the distribution of supplies in both the CCP-occupied areas and the National Government areas has been excellent. However, it has been repeatedly obstructed since May. Furthermore, now that foreign ships can sail directly into inland rivers, it is extremely convenient for transporting supplies. He then recounted his efforts to promote shipping because transportation is the most severe problem in our country.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the relief to the CCP area in northern Jiangsu, the first batch of 300 tons of flour, old clothes, and medicine was sent by Zhang Renji, a special commissioner of the Su-Ning Branch, to Huaiyin on April 29th to be distributed. According to Zhang's report on May 3rd, the goods had arrived in Huaiyin for distribution, which proves that the relief supplies have entered the CCP area.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Given that the Confucius Temples of the former Qiantang and Renhe counties within the provincial capital were destroyed by the enemy during the period of occupation, leaving only vacant land, while the old Prefectural School Confucius Temple on Labor Road has miraculously survived after the victory, albeit with some ritual utensils stolen, and as customs and rituals are now being restored, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially ordered the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Hang County Government to jointly invite learned scholars from the province and city, as well as respected elders from the local community, to form a Provincial Government Confucius Temple Property Clearing Committee. Representatives designated by both the Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus will participate to be responsible for clearing up, repairing, and safeguarding the property.

<p>Kunshan: Yurong Steamer Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>The Yurong steamer, belonging to the Shenxi Steam Navigation Joint Association, was towing eleven cargo ships from Wuxi to Shanghai on the 16th. However, upon entering the Jiapaigang area within Kunshan, it was suddenly intercepted by eight bandits. Although the crew members managed to collect 771,500 yuan in national currency, it was still not enough to satisfy the bandits' greed. They proceeded to search and rob all the cargo ships and passengers, with no one spared. The total loss is estimated to be around 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Mobilizing Voluntary Labor to Repair Roads</p>
<p>Commander Tang of the First Pacification Zone, recognizing that the roads and bridges both inside and outside the city of Wuxi have been damaged, significantly impacting transportation, has launched a voluntary labor campaign, assigning various military and police organizations to be responsible for repairs. Currently, the highways near the city suburbs are being repaired by the headquarters and its directly subordinate units, with some sections already completed. The road surfaces have been repaired and leveled, to the convenience of vehicles and pedestrians. The repair of bridges, due to the larger scale, is currently in the planning and surveying stage.</p>

They were transported to Taixing on the evening of the 15th. After inspection by the work team sent by the Suning Branch Office, they will be distributed. Clothing for primary school teachers and journalists will continue to be distributed. It is learned that the amount of flour claimed by the Relief Association this time differs greatly from the originally agreed amount, with a shortage of more than 8,000 bags, causing much speculation among local residents. According to the person in charge of the Association, the total number of people in need of relief, including local poor and displaced refugees, exceeds 20,000. Even after repeated reductions by the work team, there are still more than 10,000 people. The existing flour is insufficient to provide even one full meal per person.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Editorial: Politicians and Critics <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>President Song attended two receptions for Chinese and foreign journalists held by the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 19th, and delivered very clear and humorous remarks. The Q&amp;A between President Song and the journalists has appeared in various newspapers, and generally revolved around finance and economy. President Song said that engaging in politics cannot completely satisfy everyone; this is something we can acknowledge. Regarding the recent criticism from "Time" magazine's article "Bad Government," he believes it is nitpicking; we share some of the same sentiment. President Song also stated that he had previously been too busy with his duties to engage in publicity, but from now on, he is willing to fully answer questions from the outside world at various gatherings; regarding this point, we are particularly pleased.</p>
<p>Having read the special dispatches from reporters in various newspapers, we can vividly imagine President Song's demeanor during the two talks the day before yesterday. Although we did not personally witness his coughs, President Song's words were indeed in his tone. Regardless of the content of his answers, President Song's demeanor this time is worthy of praise. The fundamental spirit of democracy lies in allowing criticism. A politician, bearing the heavy responsibility of the country, his policies, his measures, every move and every word, are all related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If he sincerely wants to lead the country onto the path of democracy, the politician must make every effort to approach the people and listen to their opinions. Especially news reporters, they are the bridge or megaphone between the people and the government. If a politician is afraid of meeting reporters, avoiding them like the plague, it is like crossing a river without a bridge. If reporters want to find out the truth of the political situation, but cannot easily reach an authority with actual responsibility, then even if they want to transmit the voice of the people, it will inevitably be empty and meaningless. In this case, how can there not be estrangement? This is painful and frustrating for the reporters, but it is also a great loss for the politicians. As long as we often see the stories of the late President Roosevelt of the United States meeting with news reporters, displaying both humor and seriousness, we dare say that a politician's cultivation of his temperament in receiving news reporters is really the basic condition of democratic demeanor. Generally, people often say that President Song has a foreign air and is not easy to approach; however, we believe that as long as he has the temperament of politicians in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, and can often engage with reporters as frankly and humorously as he did the day before yesterday, it will be of great benefit to China's politics!</p>
<p>President Song believes that the current criticisms from the outside world are sufficient to prove that freedom of speech exists, and that criticism is not surprising. This understanding is very valuable! Democratic politics is politics that can withstand everyone's criticism. The so-called criticizing politics originally contains two aspects of consideration: on the part of the critic, there must be the courage to avoid being sentimental, the sincerity to seek the facts, and at the same time, must strictly adhere to the principles of respecting oneself and respecting the other party. Only in this way can it be called criticizing politics, rather than defaming individuals. In countries with freedom of speech, such as Britain, the big hat of freedom of the press cannot cancel the defamation law, which is due to the strict boundary between criticism and defamation. On the part of the politician, there must be the patience to listen to criticism, the wisdom to explain criticism, and most importantly, there must be ample tolerance for criticism. Politicians should know that the impulse of critics when their emotions are agitated often leads to exaggeration, and it is inevitable that they will engage in personal attacks. Whether politicians have the tolerance is the reason whether the atmosphere of criticizing politics can be cultivated. When President Roosevelt was a local official, once a group of citizens marched and protested, shouting slogans to overthrow him, but he stood on the balcony upstairs to watch their march, dismissing it with a smile, as if nothing had happened. During his presidency, he implemented the New Deal, and he did not know how many people opposed and attacked him before and after, but he absolutely did not blame anyone's criticism and attack, except for announcing his policies and implementing his policies. The greatness of President Roosevelt and the reason why the American government has become a model of democracy are manifested in these places. President Song's recognition that "freedom of speech exists, and criticism is not surprising" should not only be cheered by critics, but also by those who aspire to be politicians, who should be excited that China is indeed gradually embarking on the road to democracy. The temporary success or failure of a politician is a small matter; the success or failure of cultivating a democratic atmosphere in Chinese politics is a major matter. We not only welcome President Song's demeanor, but also hope that all government officials and even civil servants with "a post and a half" have this tolerance, and never repay grievances with grudges, behaving like a petty man.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to take the opportunity to mention our feelings after reading "Time" magazine's "Bad Government" article. "Time" magazine, edited by Luce, is originally an impartial publication in the United States. Its criticism of China's political situation has been able to say a few fair words over the years, and in the eyes of some leftist American reporters, it may even be accused of being right-leaning and protecting the Kuomintang. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" editorial on the 17th said that "Time" has now leaned to the left! We will leave aside whether "Time" is leaning to the right or to the left for the moment, but there is a sentence in this article in "Time" magazine that is worth our attention and sighing over, namely: "Nothing but a good government can stop the Chinese Communist Party from embarking on the path of revolution!" In fact, how can this not be true for China? Any government, as long as it is indeed good, where will there be revolution again? We certainly do not want China to have another violent revolution after the eight-year war, and we especially do not want to see the Chinese Communist Party hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat, insisting on having another armed rebellion in China and calling it a communist revolution. However, the best way to prevent this unnecessary revolution is indeed to establish a "good government." "Time" magazine reporters' call may not be very far from the call of the Chinese people. The so-called "good government," in today's China, is extremely simple: first, it must be clean and honest; second, it must be efficient; third, it must have a long-term vision, doing big things for the country and not competing with the people for small profits. "Time's" criticism may be excessive, especially since it only writes about the dark side and does not see the bright side; however, whether today's government has done a perfect job, there must be public opinion both in the government and among the people. Even President Song has publicly said in the Political Consultative Conference and the Central Plenary Session that he himself is not satisfied with the current financial and economic situation, and this time he met with reporters and asked everyone with a smile if they had any good ideas, hoping to propose them for discussion, which shows that he does not shy away from the fact that the current government should strive for further progress to reach the level of a truly "good government." There is no need to be afraid of "Time's" reporters' nitpicking; the most fearful thing is that our officials in charge are unwilling to face this reality squarely. Now that President Song can frankly admit this reality, then as long as he is brave enough to take responsibility, brave enough to reflect, and solicit public opinion, starting from scratch, a "good government" can emerge on the spot. As long as we can make a great determination and first carry out a thorough purge of corruption, the "good government" will have a beginning. "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." Establishing a "good government" is just like that. Let's see if our politicians have this courage and this perseverance!</p>

<h3 id="e34">Current French Foreign Minister Bidault Elected President of the Provisional Government; Communist Party Abstains from Voting; France Takes a Further Step Away from Left-Leaning <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The National Constituent Assembly met today, and the Provisional President and Prime Minister Gouin gave a speech, praising General de Gaulle highly, to which the members responded with enthusiastic applause. Immediately afterwards, a vote was held to elect the President of the Provisional Government. Georges Bidault, one of the leaders of the Popular Republican Movement, and the current Foreign Minister, was elected with 384 votes (out of a total of 545 votes). Bidault had received the support of the Socialist Party, while the Communist Party abstained, and the Unified Resistance Movement and eleven Christian Democrats also abstained.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] After Foreign Minister Bidault, leader of the Popular Republican Movement, was elected as the President of the Provisional Government of France today, the Socialist Party officially announced that five of their members who originally intended to vote in favor temporarily did not vote and should be counted as voting in favor. Therefore, President Bidault received a total of 389 votes. Previously, Communist Party member Croizat declared that the party was prepared to make considerable concessions on the new constitution, meaning that the party could approve a certain form of House of Representatives in a bicameral parliament, and could also increase the power of the President so that he would not become a puppet. Observers believe that this statement is a prelude to the Communist Party's preparation to compromise and participate in the government. The Socialist Party also expressed its willingness to accept a compromise in accordance with de Gaulle's wishes regarding the bicameral parliament and presidential powers.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] After Bidault was elected President of the Provisional Government, France has taken a further step away from left-leaning. His election as president by the Constituent Assembly has paved the way for the formation of a new cabinet. He will serve as Prime Minister concurrently, or another person will be appointed to fill the post. Political observers believe that the development of the situation will be advantageous to adopting the former method.</p>
<h3 id="e35">A Brief Biography of Bidault <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Bidault is a capable new figure. Born in Moulins on October 5, 1899, he is currently 46 years old, the youngest of the four major foreign ministers. He began his military service at the end of the First World War in 1918. After the war, he left the army to continue his studies and participate in the Catholic Youth Movement. With his extraordinary talent, he finally became the leader of the Popular Republican Movement. Later, he served as a history professor at the University of Paris and a journalist. At this time, as a member of the People's Democratic Party, he vigorously promoted his political views in newspapers, and his articles such as "The Annexation of Austria," "The Spanish Civil War," and "The Munich Agreement" were widely circulated. He firmly opposed fascism and Nazism. Among the three left-wing parties in France, he represented the new left.</p>
<p>In 1940, he joined the army and served, but was captured by the enemy in May of the same year. He was released in 1941 as a veteran. After regaining his freedom, he participated in anti-enemy work in southern France and later joined the National Resistance Committee, where he was elected as chairman. He led secret anti-enemy organizations during the French occupation and achieved great success.</p>
<p>Bidault's diplomatic experience is not rich. He took office as French Foreign Minister in September 1944 and accompanied de Gaulle to Moscow to sign the Franco-Soviet Treaty. The important international conferences he has attended include the San Francisco Conference, the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, the First Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the most recent Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th dispatch] Anti-Communist demonstrators attacked the headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris at 1:30 this morning, shouting "De Gaulle should retake power" and "Burn Thorez at the stake" (note: Thorez is the leader of the French Communist Party). The incident occurred after a parade was held on the evening of the second anniversary of the anti-German resistance. The demonstrators broke the doors and windows of the Communist Party headquarters, took away propaganda pamphlets and slogans, and burned them publicly in the streets. The French Ministry of the Interior has launched an investigation into the incident and arrested several people. Today, when Communist Party representatives attended the Constituent Assembly, they issued a public condemnation of the riot. The Paris District Trade Union, led by the Communist Party, has issued a notice asking all workers in Paris to go on strike from 5:00 PM tomorrow and hold a demonstration in front of the Communist Party headquarters to protest this morning's incident.</p>

(2) Stop the conflict, with both sides' troops holding their original defenses.

<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] Soviet representative Gromyko today proposed to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission the establishment of an international agreement banning the manufacture and use of atomic bombs. It is said that the manufacture of atomic bombs can only have negative consequences for world peace. Scientific inventions cannot become the exclusive domain of one country, and will eventually be obtained by other countries. British representative Cadogan promised that Britain would do its best to fully cooperate in assisting the establishment of an international organization to ban atomic bombs and punish those who violate this international control mechanism. Cadogan warmly welcomed the plan put forward by the United States to the Atomic Energy Commission, saying that the British government fully agreed with the US position that those who violated the international control mechanism "must be immediately given appropriate and effective punishment, and the most valuable weapon to prevent such violators is to make people deeply aware that punishment is inevitable and irresistible." The US proposal was put forward by Baruch last Friday, advocating the establishment of an international control mechanism for atomic energy, and then the United States would destroy its existing atomic bombs and stop manufacturing new bombs. All development of atomic energy would be used to benefit mankind. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi spoke immediately, saying that the proposal made by US representative Baruch could serve as the basis for the establishment of an atomic energy control mechanism, and that small countries should participate as much as possible. The Canadian representative also agreed with the US plan.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Maeda Tamon, a former newspaper reporter and Minister of Education in the first post-war cabinet, testified today at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, stating that Japanese warmongers, in an attempt to justify aggression, regarded Manchuria as a "buffer state to defend against the Soviet Union." Maeda said that in 1928, the militarists launched a propaganda campaign foreshadowing the Mukden Incident of 1931, but he could not recall the details. However, the formation of the Tanaka Cabinet was to adopt a more aggressive policy towards Manchuria. In early 1930, the government began to promote domestically that Manchuria was Japan's "lifeline" and that a stronger policy must be adopted. Initially, there were no clear measures to suppress newspapers opposing this continental policy, and the authorities hoped that newspapers, speakers, and other individuals would support the government's national policy. Subsequently, restrictions on speech in Japan became strict, and the Japanese people became silent as cicadas in winter, afraid to discuss national policy. Japan's propaganda plan had a dual purpose, namely to counter domestic criticism. Various newspapers, publishers, writers, speakers, and virtually all available channels of propaganda, extolled Manchuria as Japan's lifeline, and that Japan must expand its influence in that direction, develop its economy and industry, and make it a buffer state against the Soviet Union. Japanese propaganda further distorted certain treaties, claiming that Japan had the right to control Manchuria. Emotional propaganda was based on the fact that Japanese soldiers had shed blood in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War, therefore the Japanese people had the right to control it and enjoy its fruits. Furthermore, two lieutenant colonels visited me, expressing dissatisfaction with my opposition to the Anti-Comintern Pact, and ordering me to change my tune in the future. Although they did not make any actual threats, the clanging of their swords left no room for rebuttal. Assistant Prosecutor Hamerick read several sections from the book "The Path of the Subject," which Maeda said was published by the Ministry of Education in March 1941. The book described the "sacredness of the empire" and the "evil of Western thought," and encouraged the Japanese people to abandon individualistic ideas. The greatest goal of the Emperor's subjects was to serve the nation. The book called the European world a materialistic adventure, and claimed that the British and American armies were attempting to monopolize the world, and that it was necessary to liberate the countries of the Far East from white rule.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 20th, United Press] Communist Party members Okano Susumu, Tagikuichi Yoshio, and two others (the first Communist Party members elected to parliament in Japanese history) unanimously refused to attend the opening ceremony of the 90th extraordinary session of parliament, because the meeting was a joint session of both houses, inaugurated by the Emperor in the House of Peers, and the Communist Party opposes the Emperor system. In his short inaugural speech, the Emperor announced the formal opening of the 90th extraordinary session of parliament and instructed both houses to cooperate in discussions to pass the new constitution, budget, and other "important" bills. Thirty-eight female members of parliament attended the inauguration ceremony, a first in Japanese history.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] London, 20th Broadcast: There has been a startling development in India today. Nehru, the leader of the Congress Party, was stabbed by a British bayonet and then arrested. The Congress Working Committee has announced an indefinite postponement. According to the British, Nehru was arrested because he disobeyed orders and entered the province of Kashmir without permission. Kashmir is the center of recent labor disputes, and the British have ordered Nehru not to enter the area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New Delhi, 20th] Yesterday, Nehru clashed with armed police guards when he entered Kashmir, resulting in minor bayonet wounds to his face. Nehru's actions were a challenge to the government's ban on his entry into the territory. Nehru led a large crowd, initially walking four miles before traveling by car to a point fifty miles inside Kashmir, where they stayed overnight. He was accompanied by a member of the Central Legislative Assembly and a member of the Congress Working Committee, the former of whom also sustained minor injuries. Nehru said that his purpose in going to Kashmir was to negotiate the release of Abdullah. According to the India United Press, the recent riots in Kashmir were orchestrated behind the scenes by the British Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency New York, 20th] The International Health Conference is being held here today to study various plans for the establishment of a global health organization. UN Economic and Social Council President Mudalier was appointed chairman. Truman sent a message stating: The health problems we face do not originate from war, but war has exacerbated these problems. Modern transportation has made it impossible for countries to quarantine and prevent the spread of disease. Therefore, countries must develop cooperative health organizations and international action must be coordinated. International scientific cooperation played a critical role in the victory in this war, so international health cooperation will also play a critical role in the fight against disease. The President's message was read by American representative to the Economic and Social Council, Weinant. Representatives from the 51 member states of the United Nations attended, as well as representatives from 16 non-member states and representatives from the Allied Control Commissions for Germany, Japan, and Korea. UN Secretary-General Lie gave the opening address, urging all representatives not to waste any time or energy on useless and aimless debates, but to concentrate our efforts on saving the lives of millions of people and improving the lives of tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 20th] In addition to member countries of the United Nations organization, the other countries participating in the International Health Conference include: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland, and Transjordan.</p>

<p>General Assembly Scheduled for July 15</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Over 50 representatives from Hongmen Zhigongtang from major ports at home and abroad have been gathering in Shanghai in recent days to deliberate on various preparatory matters for reorganizing the association into a political party, and to draft relevant charters and regulations. After the party is established, the highest responsible person will be Situ Meitang, "Chairman of the China Hongmen Zhigong Party Headquarters." The person in charge in Shanghai will be Zhao Yu, the current "Director General of the China Zhigong General Hall." It is reported that the party headquarters will be located in the capital.</p>
<p>According to the leaders of the party, their purpose in forming the party is not to seek official positions or wealth, but to unite Hongmen brothers and assist in national reconstruction. They will still adhere to the three traditional tenets of Hongmen, namely: (1) uniting with loyalty, (2) saving the country with sincerity, and (3) eliminating the wicked with chivalry. They firmly stated that they will never be exploited by any party, and that all actions will be premised on the welfare of the people of the country. As for the number of party members, it is said that there may be more than 100,000 in this city alone, but the exact number can only be counted after future registration. Among overseas Chinese, the party has a particularly strong presence. Currently, 41 Zhigong branches have been established in various ports in Canada. In addition, there are 12 similar organizations in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Honolulu, Cuba, Panama, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico, and other places. There are also 17 so-called Dart Coon Clubs in Canada, which are also affiliated with the association, and there are four types of news media. The financial and human resources are considerable. Furthermore, the Zhigongtang has a long history and made many contributions to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's founding of the Republic. Chen Jiongming once attempted to use the association as a basic force for political activities, but ultimately failed. After the association is reorganized into a political party, a meeting will be held in Shanghai on July 15. Overseas representatives will return to their respective countries after the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Focus of Four Banks Joint Office Loans: Securing Foreign Exchange and Materials <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Loans Divided into Three Stages: Production, Transportation, and Packaging</p>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that the recent loan policy of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Joint Office emphasizes securing foreign exchange and materials. Loans in this area can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage involves loans for production, such as the recent tea loan of 7 billion yuan and the spring silk cocoon loan of 20 billion yuan, to enable the completion of the production and manufacturing of various agricultural products. The second stage involves foreign exchange loans during transportation. For example, tea and silk from the Southeast region and leather, medicinal materials, pig bristles, and tung oil from Sichuan and Hankou need to be provided with convenient foreign exchange loans. This will ensure that rural materials can be continuously transported to cities for export. The third stage involves loans for packaging. For example, once materials have been collected in cities and purchase contracts have been established with foreign merchants, loans or overdrafts will be provided during the packaging of these materials, enabling exporters to pay export taxes and transportation costs. In addition to this, the office's existing loan policies are not immutable. They are adjusted based on price levels, market dynamics, government policies, and general needs. As for loans to industrial and mining enterprises, more loans were issued at the beginning when many factories were resuming operations. Recently, as most factories have already resumed operations, fewer loans have been issued. However, general industrial and commercial loans continue to be processed based on the actual situation.</p>

<p>Over 2,300 Dance Hostesses in the City: Police Bureau to Close Registration on the 24th</p>
<p>The registration of dance hostesses, which began on the 17th of this month, has been progressing well. As of yesterday, a total of 1,500 dance hostesses have registered. According to police statistics, there are over 2,300 dance hostesses in the city, and all of them must register. The registration deadline is the 24th of this month. Dance halls that employ dance hostesses must register with the police bureau based on their business licenses and submit three photographs. Before starting work, dance hostesses must also register with the police bureau to obtain permits. The employer must accompany the dance hostess to the police bureau to fill out an application form and submit the employment contract for verification. After approval by the police bureau, a permit will be issued, which is valid for six months. It is learned that foreign dance hostesses must also register with the police bureau to operate legally. As of yesterday, no foreign dance hostesses had registered with the police bureau. Most of the dance hostesses are between 16 and 22 or 23 years old, while very few are between 30 and 40 years old. Foreign dance hostesses tend to be older. These dance hostesses mainly dance because of financial difficulties. There are very few exceptions. Yesterday, about one hundred dance hostesses from the Paramount, New Xianlin, and Metropolis dance halls registered.

<h3 id="e69">Counterfeit $50 U.S. Bills Discovered in the Market: Exquisite Printing Makes Identification Difficult <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the number of counterfeit U.S. dollars discovered in the market has been increasing. Yesterday, a reporter visited the U.S. Army Headquarters Crime Investigation Department in Hongkou New Asia Restaurant, where they were received by Captain Marist, the director of the department, and Captain Pullotin, the deputy director. They informed the reporter that the counterfeit bills discovered are all $50 bills. The differences are as follows: 1. Front: There is a "2" in the middle of the "Serial Number" on the right side. The letter "B" in the bank name is particularly large. There are "A4" and other characters on the bottom right and top left. 2. Back: Printed with the number "106". These counterfeit bills are all printed with the words "Printed in 1934". Furthermore, the printing technique is extremely sophisticated, and it is impossible for non-experts to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit bills. The reporter then inquired about what effective measures the U.S. military authorities plan to adopt. They were informed that in addition to issuing an emergency notice, informing all relevant authorities to refuse to accept any suspicious $50 bills, investigators and detectives have been specially selected and dispatched to investigate. Captain Ma emphasized that the rampant counterfeit bills not only affect Shanghai's finances but also damage the credibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. The authorities will do everything possible to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>[Additional News] It is reported that after hearing that the U.S. military authorities are refusing to accept $50 U.S. bills, currency exchange shops have started offering discounts, ranging from 10% to 4%.</p>
<h3 id="e70">After Further Interrogation by the District Procuratorate: Wang Daren Was Taken Back by the Garrison Command; Wang's Family Was Also Placed Under Surveillance <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Ren Xingya Claims He Has Not Committed Any Crimes</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning, the District Court Procuratorate interrogated Wang Daren and Ren Xingya, two grain officials, and grain merchant Shao Jigao again at about 10:00 AM. The interrogation ended at about 2:00 PM, and they were taken back to the garrison command for detention. Ren and Shao remained in custody at the District Court Detention Center. Ren had his head shaved and was still wearing a beige Zhongshan suit. His leather belt had been replaced with a plain white belt used by prisoners, and his shoelaces had also been removed. According to his statement to the reporter: (1) The "Grain Goods Regulations" stipulate that anyone with the ability to purchase grain can apply for a loan. As for grain merchants purchasing grain from various places, they are often detained due to the ban on grain exports in various counties, so they usually transport grain once a month. (2) Grain merchants have their own capital in addition to loans, and their stockpiling of grain may be done using their own capital. (3) After the grain arrives, he immediately orders that it not be stored in warehouses but sold to the market as soon as possible to suppress grain prices. As for whether the grain merchants comply, he does not know. Therefore, the so-called corruption and malfeasance have nothing to do with him. If there is any, he requests that it be strictly dealt with. According to Prosecutor Wu's statement to the reporter, both Wang and Ren have good attitudes during the investigation and answered questions clearly. Unless there is unexpected new evidence, the investigation of this case can be concluded before the end of the month, and a decision will be made on whether to file a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the District Procuratorate sent bailiffs to the Garrison Command to transfer Rong Yongming, but because Commander Xuan and the director of the military law department were both out on official business, the transfer had not been completed by the evening. Wang Xunzhi, the manager of the Yangtze River Company who is in custody, was interrogated again by the military law department yesterday. All the account books of the grain merchants were also closely inspected by the department.</p>
<p>According to inquiries from our reporter, Wang Daren's family has been placed under surveillance by the Garrison Command starting yesterday.</p>

<p>Friends, if you want to rent a house, pick one any size!</p>

There are plenty of opportunities, and besides, aren't gold bar transfer fees supposed to be strictly prohibited? So you pick up the phone, patiently wait for the dial tone, and call the phone numbers listed in the advertisements to inquire.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Traitorous Puppet Regime's Special Agent Bigwig: Pan Da on Trial <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A Third Pretentious, Entirely Acting Like a Fool</p>
<p>Claims Mr. Dai Invited Him to Dinner: Judge Qiu Gets Angry and Reprimands Him</p>
<p>[Our Report] Pan Da, a traitorous special agent bigwig of the puppet regime, dominated the western Shanghai area when Shanghai was under enemy occupation, harming the country and the people. His crimes are well-known. Pan is from Guangdong and graduated from Guanghua University. He joined the puppet regime in 1940 and served as the director of the Fourth Division of the Special Agent Headquarters. Later, he also served as the director of the Preparatory Office for the Recovery of the Road Beyond the Settlement of the Puppet Regime, a councilor of the puppet municipal government, the director of the West Shanghai Special Police Headquarters, and the director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau. Yesterday, when he was interrogated by the High Court, Pan was wearing a lotus-colored long gown, still with a third of false politeness. He completely denied the crimes alleged by the prosecutor, such as using the power of the enemy puppet regime to oppress the people. When asked about the internal organization of No. 76, Pan hesitated and avoided giving a direct answer. Judge Qiu became very angry and rebuked him for pretending to be a fool and trying to evade responsibility. He also asked why he had seized the house at No. 40 Cisfell Road owned by the Tao family. Pan claimed that the house was rented from Pan Sansheng, and he paid a monthly rent of 1,000 yuan for a total of two months. He cunningly claimed that he was a third-level tenant, not a second-level landlord, so how could he have seized the house? The court also asked about the bombing case in Zhaofeng Park and rebuked his special police headquarters for using this major event to frame underground workers. Pan defended that the Special Agent Headquarters was for suppressing opium, gambling, and correcting bad local customs. Judge Qiu also asked whether he had colluded with the traitor Wu Shibaobao during his tenure as the district chief of the Fourth District to harm young people and kill compatriots. Pan also denied this in every possible way. He also claimed: "Because I knew that I was doing a bad job, I deeply regretted it, so after 1943, I participated in underground work and contacted the central government. On September 20th of last year, Mr. Dai Li even invited me to dinner. Who knew that he would arrest me after the meal." Judge Qiu immediately rebuked him: "You are really powerful. Even Mr. Dai Li had to invite you to dinner to arrest you. Your skills are really not small!" After further detailed questioning, he was ordered to be detained and the interrogation was postponed.</p>
<p>Also, Qu Bin, the head of the General Affairs Section of the puppet China Electric Company, Zhou Wenrui, the chairman of the board of the puppet Racecourse Sports School, Qian Xiaomin, the acting director of the Information Section of the Wuxi Station of the Second Bureau of the puppet Political Security Department in the Southern Jiangsu District, and Huang Qinwen and Hong Wenjiang, who manipulated the sale of fresh pork in the Northern Jiangsu Company, harming merchants and people, were also interrogated and their cases were postponed.</p>

However, Joe Louis ultimately won with a quick victory.

<p>The Hongkou Dangtian Swimming Pool is now one of the branches of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Field. It was never repaired during the enemy puppet regime, and the interior has been severely damaged, especially the machine room filtration system. If it is not renovated, the pool water will inevitably become turbid, which would not only reduce swimmers' interest, but also affect hygiene. In addition, the entire building leaks almost everywhere, and the showerheads and electrical wiring are also incomplete. Repairs will take a considerable amount of time. The Bureau of Public Works engineers estimated that repairs would cost 30 million yuan. After Jiang Xiangqing, director of the sports field, took over the pool, he immediately began work. The repair costs were agreed upon with the responsible leaders and will be borne by the sports field itself. It is scheduled to open in early next month.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Fireflies <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>In the countryside at night, it's now the time to lightly fan and chase fireflies, but living in the heart of this big city, it's not easy to see those summer night messengers like little stars.</p>
<p>Because of the muggy weather, he took a milky green palace fan and went to the balcony to cool off. He lay quietly, letting his mind wander infinitely; he didn't look at the neon lights of the city around him, or the dazzling electric lights. Lying face up, he looked at the sparse little stars in the distant sky; gradually, a wisp of thin memories enveloped his vision: he saw a line of firefly light bands, and remembered the firefly he had lost contact with.</p>
<p>Firefly was a slender, fair-skinned girl with a personality that was outwardly gentle but inwardly strong, who often loved to write lyrical and delicate short poems; she said that she had liked firefly light since she was a child, so in all her finished poems, she wrote the pen name "Firefly," and others called her Firefly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, he was living in the countryside not far from the city to recuperate from an illness. Firefly moved from the city to the countryside with a relative's family. It was summer vacation at that time, and he was living a very quiet and comfortable life, doing nothing but reading a few books, and no one came to bother him, so his illness gradually improved.</p>
<p>Once, by chance, he met Firefly, perhaps because they lived only across a garden from each other. It turned out that they were classmates in the same school, so on the basis of school friendship, they soon got rid of their unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>The hot and long days of summer slowly passed, and the twilight hours were also very long; the evening glow hung on the treetops in the garden, as if reluctant to leave, not moving for a long time. At this time, only wisps of rising smoke from evening cooking drifted from the roofs of the country houses, and some tired birds flew back to their nests; all of this, like monotonous and soft lines, painted a beautiful picture of the evening scenery of rural life; it gave people a feeling of tranquility and seclusion, and at the same time, a sense of peace in solitude. It was at such times that he often met Firefly in the garden behind the house, and they would walk around the garden together, or sit under the trees and chat; their feelings for each other grew with each passing day, and they could confide in each other without restraint.</p>
<p>The black night in the countryside was like being immersed in a layer of cool silk; he and Firefly sat on the stone slab away from the trees. Under the fence of the garden, several fireflies flew around, flashing their light, probing the mysteries of the dark night; crisscrossing back and forth, without a moment's rest, their eyes followed the firefly light. At first, they were silent, as if facing the firefly light, each had endless thoughts waiting to be poured out.</p>
<p>"Do you love this firefly light?" Finally, she tilted her head and slowly began to ask him.</p>
<p>"I'm not very interested in these." He replied casually, but then immediately said, "Oh, I remember, your pen name is Firefly, that's not bad." After he finished the last sentence, he felt a little confused.</p>
<p>"Don't associate the firefly light with my messy pen name, I'm just asking if you like firefly light?" She was a little embarrassed and felt shy.</p>
<p>"Isn't firefly light too weak? It has no power in the world."</p>
<p>"Although it is such a small thing, it is not afraid of darkness, nor is it afraid of the raging night in a storm; it wants to fly, it wants to emit light; even if it is trampled to death by others, its light still remains on its corpse," she said a little hastily, and stopped speaking because of a slight cough.</p>
<p>"But you have to be careful of its destruction!" He said quietly.</p>
<p>"No, it has courage - this also symbolizes life."</p>
<p>"The roads in the world are full of bumps and twists! The road that humans walk will not be as free as the fireflies traveling in the boundless night!" His voice was like the morbid tone of a sick person.</p>
<p>"The darkness of the night is like the bumps and twists in the world, so terrible and sinister, and isn't the real society a mass of darkness? In the vast universe, humans are like fireflies, they want to bring light to the world, even if it is a pitiful little bit, it is still their task!"</p>
<p>"That's a fact, but fantasies are mostly perfect and lovely, like a bird with incomplete feathers, before it leaves the nest to learn to fly, relying on the ready-made nurture of its mother, hiding in a comfortable nest, it thinks about its ambitions, thinking about how beautiful and high the outside blue sky is, but when it leaves the nest, it will be different." He seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for her.</p>
<p>"So, are you saying that I don't have courage?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Then are you afraid, afraid of real life?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily." In fact, her questioning had unintentionally touched his heart, and his timidity in front of girls.</p>
<p>"You are tired..." She continued to question, she originally wanted to say you are tired of life, but after saying the word tired, she suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>He didn't answer for a long time, and then he shook his head as if he was tired.</p>
<p>That night, although it was a faint half-moon, the moonlight could shine on them through the gaps in the leaves, and their faces could be seen clearly. But he didn't look at her, and after shaking his head to her question, he slowly sank his head into his hands on his knees. Suddenly he stood up, staring blankly at the dark corner of the house.</p>
<p>She also stood up, walked to his side and said:</p>
<p>"Not feeling well?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, still silent.</p>
<p>"It's late, don't catch a cold anymore, go back to sleep, I'm going back too." She pulled his hand and walked out of the garden.</p>
<p>He looked at her back, and saw the distant fireflies, carrying a brighter light than usual, flying higher and higher, and after a moment, he went into the house.</p>
<p>A month passed quickly, and every evening, they often walked in the garden and sat under the trees to cool off. His illness had recovered, but unfortunately at that time, the war in the south suddenly became tense, and everyone was planning to flee, preparing to leave this village and go to another place.</p>
<p>He stayed in the city for a week to take care of some things before returning to the countryside, and then he knew that Firefly had already left here with her relatives. After he returned home, the servant gave him a letter, which was written to him by Firefly; he opened it and saw that it was just a blank piece of paper, with a short poem entitled "Firefly" written on it, with Firefly's name signed under the title. The poem was written like this:</p>
<p>What is lost?</p>
<p>In this lightly cold night,</p>
<p>You still light your faint light alone</p>
<p>Searching back and forth.</p>
<p>Wanting to compete with the stars for brilliance?</p>
<p>The stars are sparkling all night long,</p>
<p>But you</p>
<p>Are just a fleeting glimmer;</p>
<p>Firefly!</p>
<p>When you come and go by my ears,</p>
<p>Are you telling me:</p>
<p>"Even if life is like a昙花,</p>
<p>My own road</p>
<p>Is still lit by myself?"</p>
<p>The next day, he also left the countryside in a panic, because everyone was wandering in turmoil, so after a few years of separation, in addition to living a precarious life, he could no longer get any news of Firefly.</p>
<p>Now he is wandering in this noisy city near the coast, the temptation of the night, and the music of the radio blowing in the cool wind, he seems to have not heard any of these, he is immersed in the quiet and silent summer night in the countryside.</p>
<p>Tonight it is late, but he still did not go downstairs, staring blankly at the small stars in the distant sky; he thought that these stars are like the firefly light that Firefly said!</p>
<p>Firefly, firefly light, life, he thought about it in a series of thoughts.</p>
<p>6, 10, late at night</p>
<p>Herding horses return, desolate smoke carved.</p>

<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Mother was a beautiful woman. She had a delicate face, soft black hair, and a pair of exquisite small hands. She often wore light gray dresses, wandering under the wintersweet trees, holding me in her right arm, and holding my older sister's hand in her left hand, gently saying:</p>
<p>"Baby, Amitabha, Mommy's darling, Mommy's treasure! Mommy is so distressed, you must always listen to Mommy, oh!..."</p>
<p>Mother's voice was like a clear spring in the deep mountains, gurgling down from infinite heights, and mother's love also flowed down from infinite heights, but she was on the bed, panting, groaning, pain and fatigue trapped her whole body. However, a light breeze blew outside the window, and she immediately struggled to sit up, stretched out a withered hand, touched me, touched my older sister, and a string of tears dripped down:</p>
<p>"Poor children! It's so cold, the cotton-padded coats haven't been made yet. I don't know when Mommy's illness will get better, when can I make cotton-padded coats for you!..."</p>
<p>Mother's tears were crystal bright pearls, illuminating my childish and ignorant heart, illuminating my ignorant and ignorant soul. Like a tamed little lamb, I prostrated myself in front of my mother's bed, pressing my mother's feverish and thin face with my small palms, silently blessing: "May Mommy's illness get better soon! May Mommy make new cotton-padded coats for us!"</p>
<p>However, Mother finally left me!</p>
<p>Even, my older sister also left me!</p>
<p>For many, many years, like a small duckweed, I have been drifting alone in the vast world!..."</p>
<p>For many, many years, in the cold world, I have been yearning for my mother, yearning for my mother's love!..."</p>
<p>Mother! When will I be able to return to my distant hometown, prostrate myself in front of your grave, press the weeds on your tomb with my thin palms, and call you softly again "Mommy"?</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"Alas! What 'reason' can be spoken of?" Little Red sighed deeply.</p>
<p>The water was hot, Little Red stood up and filled a basin, sat down in the corner of the room to take off her socks. But her feet were already swollen from the cold, no matter how hard she tried, the socks would not come off. Helpless, she asked Bao Ling to bring her a pair of scissors, and only then could she barely cut the socks open, her two feet as red as if they had been dyed.</p>
<p>"Does it hurt?" Bao Ling asked with concern.</p>
<p>"No." Little Red shook her head with a frown. "It just feels swollen and uncomfortable!"</p>
<p>Just then, the landlady arrived in the kitchen like a whirlwind, and when she saw Bao Ling squatting beside Little Red, Little Red sitting in front of a steaming basin of water, looking very intimate. This time, the landlady caught a handle, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Little Red just came back from collecting firewood, her feet were frozen, preparing to wash them with hot water. I'll cook for her." Bao Ling said, stood up, and put the rice into the pot. In her heart, she was really annoyed by the landlady's insulting tone, but she didn't want to argue with her.</p>
<p>Little Red was asked by the landlady to be extremely embarrassed, lowered her head, her face red. At the same time, she was also trembling with fear, which was even more uncomfortable than the cold! She was more afraid of the landlady than she was of the severe cold!</p>
<p>"Is this the firewood you collected today?" The landlady kicked the bundle of wet firewood with her foot disdainfully and said: "Why did you come back so late, what did you do?"</p>
<p>"It was snowing, I couldn't see the firewood, I barely used a flat bar to pry off the snow to collect this little bit. Really, Mommy! I didn't slack off for a moment." Little Red said in a low voice. She was shouting injustice in her heart!</p>
<p>"Hmph, I see you! You're also growing up, thinking big, thinking of playing some crooked tricks, aren't you? Really a natural cheap货, you can't even stick to the wall, and you've only been a child bride for a few days? You're already eager to find a man?" The landlady scolded, while maliciously glancing at Bao Ling and Little Red.</p>
<p>"No, Mommy! I didn't!" Little Red cried out aggrievedly.</p>
<p>"Landlady!" Bao Ling walked towards the landlady with a stern face. He understood what she meant, and he was so angry that he wanted to beat the fat woman.</p>
<p>But the landlady didn't wait for Bao Ling to speak, but shouted sharply:</p>
<p>"This is none of your business, aren't you going to the store?" After saying that, she walked out of the kitchen, glared fiercely at Little Red, and muttered: "Shameless little prostitute, you're already trying to seduce men at such a young age!"</p>
<p>Bao Ling saw the landlady leave, and muttered in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Old undead hag!"</p>
<p>Little Red was so angry that she couldn't speak, and after a while, she said to Bao Ling:</p>
<p>"Brother Bao Ling, you should go to the front! Don't let me cause you to suffer injustice."</p>
<p>"It's okay, I'm not afraid of her! You just wash your feet, I'll leave after I finish cooking." Bao Ling said and went to the stove again.</p>
<p>Little Red sighed, wiped her tears, touched the water in the basin, it was still very hot, so she put her feet in, suddenly, she felt a piercing pain, as if her whole body was about to fall apart, she screamed, and then suddenly fell down.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>

<h3 id="e113">Registered Rice and Grain Distributed as Much as Possible, Rice Shops Not Allowed to Stop Selling Without Permission, Otherwise It Will Be Considered Disrupting the Market <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the municipal authorities have made every effort to suppress the price of rice and grain, the rice market has not fluctuated much in the past two weeks, but the amount of transactions has been abnormally light. Recently, however, retail rice shops throughout the city have restricted the quantity of door-to-door sales. Yesterday, rice shops in the Shanghai West District publicly stopped door-to-door sales, and the general public felt even more uneasy. According to the rice industry, the reason for the suspension of retail by retail rice shops is the difficulty in purchasing goods. It is heard that the authorities have decided to continue to distribute the registered stored rice to rice shops as much as possible to meet the needs of retail sales. If there is any suspension of business, it will be investigated and dealt with according to law for disrupting the market. Yesterday, the registration of rice arriving in the city included eight types such as white japonica, totaling more than 2,000 piculs. The types and number of piculs are as follows: White japonica 870 piculs, thin rice 194 piculs, sheep indica 215 piculs, Wuxi indica 94 piculs, white yuan 65 piculs, milled indica 320 piculs, coarse white japonica 100 piculs, coarse Wuxi indica 184 piculs.</p>

<p>Flour has not gained or lost much, soybeans have been arriving continuously, and the trend is softening. The oil market has seen a surge in supply, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Broad beans have been arriving from all directions one after another, sales are sluggish, falling by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw kernels are dull and falling by 1,000 yuan. Wheat is moving but not prosperous in Ningbo, and the market is stable. Red beans continue to fall slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bean cake is normal in rural sales, and remains in a mediocre trend.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Enemy and Puppet Grain Uniformly Distributed <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The uses of the enemy and puppet grain received by the Ministry of Food, whether to supply military rations or to sell for civilian consumption, are determined according to the actual situation of each place, so as to allocate and use them appropriately. The sales portion is handled jointly with the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property. The proceeds from the sale are deposited into the special account of the Bureau in the Central Bank at any time. As for the portion allocated for military rations, because the price of military rations is lower, and most of them are first allocated by local troops or stations, in fact, it is impossible to pay the money at the market price at any time and place in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau. Now, in order to take into account both the law and the facts, the Ministry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. All received grain (including raw materials and finished products in factories), except for those approved for auction, should be handled jointly with the Bureau, and the proceeds should be turned over to the Bureau at any time for remittance to the national treasury. As for the portion of military rations that have been allocated and reserved for allocation, they should also be settled at the market price at the time of receipt and transferred from the treasury. In addition, the grain directly received and allocated by various troops or stations should be investigated by the Ministry of Military Administration and notified to the Ministry of Food for deduction within the approved military ration quota, and the transfer procedures should still be handled in accordance with the above regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Silk Factories Cannot Start Work, High Costs Make Export Difficult <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The spring cocoon season has passed, but there are still very few silk factories starting work. According to people in the silk cocoon industry, the reason why silk factories are delayed in starting work is that Japanese raw silk is currently being dumped at low prices, which affects the export market of our country's raw silk. The main reason is the soaring prices. In the past, wages accounted for only 5% of the production cost, but now they account for 20%. Now, based on the calculation of 200 cars starting, more than one million yuan will be lost every day. Silk manufacturers are all watching and waiting at this point. According to people in the silk factory industry, the silk industry has now reached the most important juncture. They urgently hope that the government can purchase raw silk at a reasonable price, allocate fuel at a flat price, and reduce loan interest rates. It is still possible to save the industry in the event of an emergency. If the silk industry receives the above assistance, then all of them will reluctantly start work.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Is There Also Embezzlement of Cocoon Loans? The Management Office Sends Personnel to Conduct Detailed Investigations in Various Places <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Cocoon Loan Management Office has recently heard that some silk manufacturers have transferred loans for other purposes. It is sending personnel to conduct detailed investigations in various places. If any are found, they will be severely punished to prevent malpractices. In addition, since the spring cocoon market has all ended, and there are still many loan procedures that have not been completed, the office has formulated measures to inform all loan manufacturers to comply with them. (1) The expenses of each loan factory shall not exceed 30% of the purchase price of fresh cocoons, and the loans received shall never be transferred for other purposes. (2) All the remaining funds shall be returned to the management office for verification and then returned to the loan bank. (3) The dry cocoons received by each manufacturer shall be stored in the Farmers Bank warehouse designated by the manufacturer. If the silk manufacturer needs to store the cocoons freely, the management office shall send personnel to the factory for supervision. (4) When the loan manufacturer stores dry cocoons in a private warehouse, the warehouse receipt shall be handed over to the management office for safekeeping.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Disputes Over Warehouse Receipts for Lun Chang Printed Cloth <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Remaining goods successively discovered in various warehouses, customers and manufacturers compete to demand extraction</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The various printed cloths produced by the British Lun Chang Factory have been selling for a long time. During the period of the fall, the factory's stored goods were seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the seized goods that were not taken away by the enemy and puppets have continued to be discovered in various warehouses. The people holding the receipts for the goods have requested the Cotton Cloth Association to forward them to the factory for negotiation and extraction, and have submitted them to the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui for approval. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Association, the receipts for the goods registered in the association amount to more than 2,600 pieces, and the number of pieces contained in each piece ranges from 20 pieces to 60 pieces, and the total number of pieces should be around 100,000 pieces. As of the latest date, the Lun Chang goods that have been discovered in various warehouses have reached more than 36,000 pieces. The goods that were forcibly purchased by the puppet merchant Tonghui from cotton cloth merchants and are still stored in various warehouses have also been discovered in tens of thousands of pieces, but the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property has not approved their return, and even the Lun Chang Factory has no right to take them back. The Cotton Cloth Association is still discussing other methods for this. As for the above-mentioned 36,000 pieces of stored goods, the factory claimed that the factory also had 4,000 pieces of stored goods at that time, which were seized by the enemy and puppets together, and advocated proportional sharing with the customer goods. The association required the receipt holders to extract the goods first, and the two sides have not yet agreed on a method. According to news from the receipt holders, the reason why the customer goods could not be extracted at that time was not due to the negligence of the customers. Now that the stored goods have been discovered, the receipt holders should extract them from the factory. They also claimed that the factory had already disposed of a part of the stored goods without authorization, which was actually damaging the rights and interests of the receipt holders. The customers will collect evidence and reason with them. (Peng)</p>

<h3 id="e121">Taiwan's Transition Period, Large Loss of Stored Sugar, Valued at Approximately 300 Billion, Authorities Are Thoroughly Investigating <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to extremely relevant sources in the sugar industry of this province, the total amount of sugar stored in Taiwan last year was 840,000 metric tons, of which approximately 330,000 metric tons were destroyed by bombing, leaving 520,000 metric tons. The amount of stored sugar gradually decreased thereafter. When the Taiwan Advanced Command Post was established before Japan surrendered, the amount of stored sugar was 300,000 metric tons. During the period when the Bureau of Industry and Mining took over, there were only 150,000 metric tons remaining. The price of sugar is one million 法幣 per metric ton. At 520,000 metric tons, the value is 520 billion 法幣. At 150,000 metric tons, the value is only 150 billion 法幣. The huge loss of stored sugar is staggering. Relevant authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. (Muyun)</p>
<h3 id="e122">Unequal Hardships and Joys in Cotton Yarn, Product Manufacturing Becomes Even More Difficult <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Industry associations in this city, including the dyeing industry, underwear industry, knitting industry, handkerchief industry, hand-woven cotton fabric industry, and towel and blanket industry, all share concerns about the difficulty of sustaining manufacturing due to the soaring price of yarn. They have gathered repeatedly to discuss ways to salvage the situation, believing that yarn mills' profits are excessively high. For the sake of the common survival of industry and the stability of society and people's livelihood, they aim to suppress yarn prices to reduce the cost of manufactured goods. It is reported that they have prepared a document to petition the Ministry of Economic Affairs for effective measures. According to sources in the yarn mill industry, the recent arrival of foreign cotton raw material has been weak, but most factories have sufficient raw cotton reserves for several months, and those with thicker reserves can use them for eight or nine months. As a result, the price of American cotton in the Shanghai market, calculated at the exchange rate, has fallen to nearly the same level as in the New York market. Moreover, all yarn spindles in yarn mills, except for the Textile Construction Company, are almost fully operational. Therefore, it is questionable whether a large amount of cotton raw material needs to be imported in the future. Although India has restricted cotton exports, it has no impact on the supply of raw materials to yarn mills here. However, currently, yarn mills are accustomed to using foreign cotton, and domestic cotton is rarely inquired about. According to people in the cotton raw material industry, each harvest of our country's cotton fields can yield three loads of seed cotton, with each load currently priced at 30,000 yuan, totaling around 90,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the current price of one load of foreign cotton (three loads of seed cotton can also be ginned into one load of lint cotton). The cost for cotton farmers, including seeds, fertilizer, and labor, is at least 100,000 yuan per mu per harvest. Amidst the rising prices of food, cotton farmers are switching to other crops. In the future, domestic cotton production will obviously decrease due to the pressure from foreign cotton. If this is the case, in the cotton industry, apart from yarn mills exclusively obtaining high profits, cotton farmers and cotton product manufacturers will both be unable to stand their ground. According to informed sources in the yarn mill industry, the rise in yarn prices is not due to the yarn mills' intentional raising of prices, but rather due to supply not meeting demand, and the Textile Construction Company's need to maintain its profits to supplement national finances. If there are appropriate measures, yarn mills are very willing to lower their selling prices. According to sources in the cotton yarn and cloth merchant industry, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are very eager to purchase domestic goods. Lian Jun, Chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, and other prominent overseas Chinese figures have petitioned the central government to open up the export of cotton products, because the current import and export trade regulations still include cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the list of prohibited export items in Schedule C. Regarding this point, the Municipal Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has met with Lian Jun and others several times, and has jointly petitioned the government with the yarn and cloth commercial associations and various cotton manufacturing industry associations to open up exports to Southeast Asia, in response to the requests of overseas Chinese. A proposal has also been put forward in this year's Chamber of Commerce members' congress, and it is said that the Chamber of Commerce is quite sympathetic to it. (Peng)</p>

<p>Rosin prices cannot be suppressed at the production site, and transportation costs are also higher than other goods because it is classified as a dangerous item during shipment. 客帮 (traveling merchants/peddlers) who transport it to Shanghai for sale have repeatedly had their prices cut by merchants, so recent arrivals have been quite scarce, and prices have slightly increased, with the market price per standard unit rising from 20,000 yuan to 22,000-23,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association held a pricing session. The morning started calmly, with 20 medium white sugar priced at 96,000 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Later, rumors spread that the company would hold another sales session, so people waited patiently. When the company's staff arrived at the association and saw the price set at 96,000 yuan, they set an opening price of 98,000 yuan. Most in the trade were dissatisfied, with some offering 90,000 yuan, but in the end, a deal was reached at 98,000 yuan. However, the more formal firms largely did not participate, so only over 3,000 bags were traded. There were complaints in the market, with someone writing on the association's blackboard "Only Profit Matters" followed by the name of a certain company with two crosses (XX company). After this fluctuation, the market revived and went upward. Number 20 medium white sugar was priced at 100,000 yuan for double bags and 100,345 yuan for single bags, closing up 4,000 yuan. Fourth period warehouse receipts for number 20 were 100,300 yuan and number 22 were 100,400 yuan, a rise of 6,000 yuan. Brand goods also followed suit with price increases, with brand white opening at 115,000 yuan, followed by 112,000 yuan to 108,000-109,000 yuan, brand red at 96,000 yuan to 99,000 yuan. Over 300 baskets of Diao Qing were priced at 80,000 yuan due to the scarcity of Shantou Qing, which had been transferred to Tianjin. Traders offered 82,000 yuan, and the brand side later raised the price by another 2,000-3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chongqing Branch of the Joint Treasury Determines Measures for Verifying and Exchanging US Dollar Savings Certificates or Drafts <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the procedures for verifying and exchanging US dollar savings certificates, the Chongqing branch of the Joint Treasury has held multiple meetings to discuss and synthesize opinions from all parties, and has formulated "Measures for Verifying and Exchanging US Dollar Savings Certificates or Drafts," which have been sent to all branches for consistent implementation. The details are as follows: (1) When applying for payment, the certificate holder or draft holder must find a reputable business to fill out a surety bond in duplicate, guaranteeing that there is no enemy or puppet relationship, and after verification, payment will be made. (2) If the certificate holder entrusts a bank to handle the verification of certificates in other locations, they must fill out an application form for entrusting the bank to handle the verification of certificates. (3) If the certificate holder needs to exchange for national currency, after verification that there is no enemy or puppet suspicion, regardless of the amount, they do not need to apply for approval from the Central Bank before processing. (4) If the certificate holder needs to designate a bank to apply for foreign exchange to offset positions or use it for compliant purposes, in addition to filling out application form CBC28, they must also fill out application form CBbba or bbca and submit it to the Central Bank for approval. (5) After the accepting bank redeems the US dollar savings certificate and verifies that it is correct, it will issue a draft payable to "Central Bank for the Account of Bank X". This draft can only be entrusted to the Shanghai head office for transfer based on the regulation "designated banks are temporarily limited to Shanghai". When other designated banks in the local area request it, it should be entrusted to the Shanghai branches for transfer. If it cannot issue a draft, the back of the certificate should be stamped with the words "Certificate of genuineness and no loss reported, and has been transferred to the account of Bank X" and a note. (6) The accepting bank should issue a temporary receipt to the customer and must not return the stamped savings certificate to the certificate holder to prevent it from circulating on the market again. (7) The accepting bank redeems US dollar savings certificates (and must stamp the certificate with the phrase "Void if picked up by someone else after transfer by Bank X"). (8) US dollar savings certificate drafts (referring to those that have already been issued) may be purchased and endorsed by the original issuing bank or designated bank (the endorsement procedure is the same as for checks), and then sent to the Central Bank for collection on its behalf. After collection, the account of the designated bank will be collected. (9) When each branch redeems US dollar savings certificates or drafts, the redeeming branch is responsible for verifying whether the certificate has any enemy or puppet suspicion. (10) Certificate holders applying for the issuance of drafts payable to designated banks other than the original issuing bank should request the designated bank to handle it on their behalf.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Having Typhoid Twice <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changhao</p>
<p>I have had typhoid fever twice.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is said to have lifelong immunity. Once a person has had typhoid fever, they usually don't get it a second time. Of course, there are exceptions. I am not necessarily an exception.</p>
<p>My first case of typhoid fever was confirmed by bacteriological examination. The second time was a mysterious long-term fever that went through all possible examinations, but no pathogen was found, so it was never diagnosed as any specific disease from beginning to end. However, according to hospital rules, any fever of unknown origin is often treated as typhoid fever. Therefore, I was treated as a typhoid fever patient twice.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of typhoid fever, it is really pitiful. Even now, there are no specific drugs or effective treatments for typhoid fever. Typhoid fever patients lie in bed, constantly having a fever, until the body develops sufficient immunity to defeat the bacteria and stop the fever. To this day, there is no drug that can truly shorten the course of typhoid fever. So being a typhoid fever patient requires patience, patience, and the third thing is still patience.</p>
<p>But not having a specific drug doesn't mean that treatment is useless. On the contrary, because there is no specific drug, treatment is especially important. The main purpose of treatment is to maintain the patient's physical strength, so that he can win the final victory in the long battle against bacteria, and so that he doesn't "die before he succeeds" due to lack of physical strength before winning the final victory, or develop any dangerous complications and die.</p>
<p>Diet is the most important part of treatment, because diet is related to both cultivating physical strength and preventing dangerous complications. I have been a typhoid fever patient twice, and I have gained experience in this area twice.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of typhoid fever are fever and intestinal ulcers. Fever consumes a lot of nutrients in the body, so in order to make up for this extra consumption, the diet must be very nutritious, especially increasing the supply of energy-providing nutrients. Intestinal ulcers cannot tolerate rough food, because rough food can stimulate intestinal movement and increase the risk of intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty years ago, European and American countries uniformly adopted milk diets for typhoid fever patients, because everyone recognized that milk is nutritious and easy to digest, but in 1909, two American doctors analyzed and studied the course of many typhoid fever patients and found that milk diets had many shortcomings and did not meet the two necessary conditions for the diet of typhoid fever patients. First, the nutritional value of milk is indeed very good, but more than 90% is water, which can provide very little energy, so no matter how many pounds you drink, it is not enough to supplement the consumption of nutrients in the body. Patients treated in this way all became skin and bones when they got better, emaciated and不堪 (unable to bear), and had to undergo a long period of recuperation to recover. Second, although milk is easy to digest, drinking too much can easily form small lumps in the stomach, which cannot be completely digested in the intestine, thus not only stimulating the intestinal tract, but also producing gas and causing the intestinal tract to swell, increasing the risk of intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation. Therefore, they advocated an easily digestible mixed diet, in addition to milk foods, adding various starch and fat foods to increase the supply of energy. Since adopting this mixed diet, typhoid fever patients can maintain their weight without any reduction after having a fever for about a month, and the dangerous complications have also been reduced.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years ago, I had typhoid fever for the first time, and at that time I was already a medical student. However, the internist who had just returned from Germany did not know about this mixed diet method. He prescribed me a milk diet, milk, milk, milk all day long. My appetite was already poor, and this made it even worse. In the end, I frowned when I saw milk. My stomach was also very bloated and uncomfortable. Fortunately, I was lucky and nothing went wrong. But when the fever subsided, I was as thin as a monkey, and it took a long time to recover.</p>
<p>The second time I had typhoid fever, I had already graduated from medical school, and the mixed diet was also the prescribed typhoid fever diet in the ward. My wife took care of my diet in the ward herself. Milk, eggs, noodles, toast, butter, beef, etc. were eaten six times a day. Because the taste was varied, I could barely eat each meal. Although this time I had a fever for more than three months, three times longer than the first fever, my weight did not change significantly when I got better. My family, who knew about my first typhoid fever, saw my condition when I was discharged from the hospital this time and simply saw it as a miracle.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Diagnosis of the Cause of Typhoid Fever <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Zhaoqi</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is also known as enteric fever. The term "enteric fever" seems inappropriate because the invasion and pathological changes of typhoid bacilli are not limited to the intestinal tract. Although the changes in the intestinal tract are the most significant, and they cause serious complications such as intestinal perforation, intestinal bleeding, and bloating.</p>
<p>Typhoid bacilli enter the intestinal tract through food and drink, invade the circulatory system through the thoracic duct, and then are distributed throughout the body via the blood, especially the reticuloendothelial system—such as bone marrow, solitary and aggregated lymph nodes of the intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. In each of the above places, a life-and-death battle unfolds between the typhoid bacilli and the body's resistance. On one hand, it is the reproduction and growth of the bacilli, and on the other hand, it is the phagocytosis and destruction by reticuloendothelial cells. The outcome of the battle determines the patient's fate.</p>
<p>Diagnosis can be divided into "etiological diagnosis," "anatomical diagnosis," "pathological diagnosis," "physiological diagnosis," etc. In bacterial infectious diseases, "etiological diagnosis" is the most important. No matter how typical the symptoms and signs are, if typhoid bacilli cannot be found, the diagnosis is still incomplete. Conversely, if typhoid bacilli are cultured from bone marrow, blood, or stool, regardless of how confusing the symptoms and signs may be, the diagnosis is as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>To seek the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, two types of chemical tests can be used: (1) Directly find the causative bacilli in the body, such as bacterial cultures of bone marrow, blood, bile, intestinal contents, stool, and urine; (2) Indirectly use serology to search for agglutinins produced by systemic typhoid bacillus infection, the so-called Widal reaction.</p>
<p>Using bone marrow culture to find typhoid bacilli is a new method in the past six years. Some doctors and patients are still unfamiliar with this method. In fact, extracting bone marrow from the sternum with a Sahli's needle for culture is a simple, easy, and harmless diagnostic procedure. It is no more painful for the patient than venipuncture. The advantages of bone marrow culture are briefly described as follows: (1) It is much easier to culture typhoid bacilli from bone marrow than from blood; and whether it is in the early or late stages of the disease, or even if the patient's body temperature is normal, as long as the bacilli are still alive in the tissues, they can be found. This significant discovery not only helps a lot with the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, but also provides a concrete answer to the pathological explanation of typhoid fever recurrence. (2) Using the same amount of bone marrow and blood for culture, because the bone marrow contains more bacilli, they grow more vigorously, so using bone marrow culture to diagnose the source of the disease can be determined earlier. (3) In obese women and children, veins are often thin or hidden by fat, making it difficult to perform venipuncture for blood culture. In this case, bone marrow culture is the only way to find typhoid bacilli in the body tissues, because sternal puncture will not fail.</p>
<p>Some people are carriers, so finding typhoid bacilli in bile, intestinal contents, stool, and urine is not as accurate as finding them in bone marrow or blood. The Widal reaction has its shortcomings: (1) As mentioned above, serological agglutination is at best indirect evidence, far less straightforward than direct evidence. (2) In most typhoid fever patients, a positive reaction only appears in the late stages of the disease. By this time, clinical phenomena and other tests are already sufficient to confirm the diagnosis without a doubt. (3) People who have had typhoid fever in the past have agglutinins left in their blood. Therefore, a positive Widal reaction does not necessarily indicate that the current infectious disease is typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is similar to smallpox, measles, etc. Once infected, lifelong immunity can be produced. (4) Public health science has been gradually promoting typhoid fever vaccination in recent years, which is a dawn for national health and is truly gratifying. However, agglutinins are also produced in the blood after typhoid fever vaccination. Especially when suffering from non-typhoid high fever, the amount of agglutinins increases, the so-called Anamnestic Reaction. If only the Widal reaction is used for diagnosis, the result will be that many patients will be misdiagnosed as typhoid fever, which would be dangerous.</p>
<p>Using strict scientific eyes and objective experience to evaluate, among various etiological diagnostic methods, bone marrow and blood culture are the most important, followed by urine culture, followed by bile, intestinal contents, and stool culture, and the Widal reaction is even less important. Although, medicine is a living science; typhoid fever is formed by the double "living factors" of the patient and the bacilli to form a living case. The difference in typhoid fever cases is like the difference in human faces. The patient's reaction to various chemical tests also varies greatly. Therefore, to strive for the "etiological diagnosis" of typhoid fever, it is necessary to adopt various methods mentioned above extensively. The more evidence, the more precise the diagnosis. With a precise diagnosis, both the patient and the doctor can have a standard.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Pathology of Typhoid Fever <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Suiyue</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is caused by typhoid bacilli invading the digestive tract with water, milk, or other food. It multiplies in the small intestine and enters the blood, leading to bacteremia. Its incubation period is about one to two weeks. Local characteristic changes occur in the intestinal lymphatic tissue, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>Changes in the intestinal tissue are seen in the solitary and aggregated lymph nodes of the intestine, especially the aggregated lymph nodes. First, the solitary and aggregated lymph nodes in the lower segment of the ileum are affected, then the lymph nodes in the upper segment of the ileum and jejunum are affected. The cecum and large intestine may also be affected. The course of typical typhoid fever can be divided into four stages: (1) The first stage is medullary swelling, which is the change in the first week. The lymph nodes are congested, red and swollen, and then the congestion subsides, appearing gray, while the swelling remains protruding. This is the phenomenon of lymphatic tissue hyperplasia. There are many small lymphocytes inside, as well as mononuclear macrophages containing red blood cells and bacilli, surrounding the mucous membrane of the lymph node. (2) The second stage is necrosis, which is the change in the second week. The center of the swollen aggregated lymph nodes and solitary lymph nodes softens and necroses, appearing yellow. (3) The third stage is ulcer formation, which is the change in the third week. The necrotic tissue falls off, forming an ulcer. The shedding starts from the edges and gradually forms an ulcer. Small nodules at the bottom of the ulcer may not fall off, so its surface is uneven. The ulcers of solitary lymph nodes are small and round; the ulcers of aggregated lymph nodes are large and oval, with the long axis generally along the longitudinal axis of the intestine. Sometimes the lymph nodes only swell and do not ulcerate, but this is rare. Sometimes the ulcers are quite deep, causing the blood vessels to ulcerate and bleed, or causing intestinal perforation, leading to severe acute peritonitis. (4) The fourth stage is the healing period, which is the change in the fourth and fifth weeks. Connective tissue grows at the ulcer site, becoming a scar. This scar is smooth and does not tend to contract, so intestinal stenosis as a sequelae is also very rare.</p>
<p>The mesenteric lymph nodes also swell, sometimes bleeding. Their lymphatic tissue presents the same changes as the intestinal aggregated lymph nodes. The sinuses contain many mononuclear macrophages, and bacilli can be seen in the lymphatic tissue and its contents.</p>
<p>The spleen is acutely congested and enlarged. The spleen pulp contains a large number of red blood cells and phagocytic mononuclear macrophages. Necrosis of intestinal aggregated lymph nodes and mesentery is also seen in this spleen.</p>
<p>Many littoral cells, mononuclear lymphocytes, and plasmacytes are also seen in the bone marrow. However, the development of granulocytic myeloid cells seems to stop.</p>
<p>Damage elsewhere: During the course of typhoid fever, other organs often undergo changes, such as degeneration or necrosis of the heart, kidney, and liver. Catarrhal changes in the respiratory system, transparent changes in the abdominal wall and its muscles. Other conditions such as otitis media, meningitis, and endocarditis are rarer.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>On the streets of the two major districts, one often sees police officers with slanted leather belts supervising and directing traffic, and as a result, traffic has indeed improved a lot, which is very gratifying!</p>
<p>However, we still have a little worry, wondering if these traffic officers are permanent? Or temporary? If they are permanent, they should be given the **word**; otherwise, the past messy **situation** will inevitably return.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is still a great puzzle, that is, why Nanjing Road prohibits rickshaws and pedicabs in the morning, while Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road do not prohibit cars? This is not only a matter of fairness, but also a big joke of the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Do we just want Nanjing Road to be unimpeded, very smooth, and look very pleasing to the eye, and have a magnificent view? Do we **want** Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road to be congested with cars and people mixed together? If so, that's called a superficial municipality, that's called a bureaucratic municipality! If not, then the method must be corrected: prohibit cars from passing through Beijing Road and Jiujiang Road, or do not prohibit rickshaws and pedicabs from passing through Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>It seems like a very small matter, but it is related to "travel," and we have the reasonable freedom to demand "travel"; perhaps these words are very presumptuous, but we still put them forward, whether they are effective or not, it is up to you!</p>
<h3 id="e131">In Memory of Engineer Hao Guilin <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xunjie</p>
<p>China needs construction, needs to revitalize industry, and absolutely cannot do without engineers.</p>
<p>The news of the suicide of French-educated engineer Hao Guilin, I think, people who see this news cannot possibly have no feelings! At least, in clothing, I shed tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>I myself am also an engineering student. When I finished reading this news, my eyes were filled with tears, dark shadows swirled in my mind, and my heart was filled with infinite anger, injustice, and grief. Mr. Hao's death means the engineering world has lost a companion!</p>
<p>Hao Guilin was born in **Year** 2 of the Republic of China and graduated from Beijing Ordnance School. He stayed in France for thirty years, which is not a short time. He studied the automotive industry and manufactured airplanes and tanks, graduated from Hanlu Mechanical Industrial School, and served as an engineer at the Paris Bisneux Ordnance Factory for many years. His accomplishments cannot be said to be not deep, and his mechanical experience cannot be said to be not rich. In France, he married a wife and had children. If he were a little selfish, even if the government ordered him **to return**, he could have a reason to refuse. However, driven by patriotism, he left his wife and children and resolutely returned to the motherland. He wanted to see the mountains and rivers after the victory and serve the motherland. At the beginning of his return to China, he was not without confidence, thinking that he would be able to settle down and develop. He did not expect to commit suicide! This was something he could not have foreseen in the beginning!</p>
<p>After returning to China, because he had no personal connections, he could not find a job, and he received only 20,000 yuan a month, which was not enough to maintain his life. He also learned that his parents and brothers had all sacrificed during the Anti-Japanese War. For a time, he was depressed, grieved, and indignant, leading to his suicide. The pain in his heart can be imagined!</p>
<p>Although Mr. Hao died by suicide, I ask, why did he commit suicide? He lived a good life in France. If there had been no government order, he would not have returned to China. He returned, and if the government had assigned him a job, he would have worked happily. However, he committed suicide because he had no job, could not bear the pressure of life, and was no longer willing to live!</p>
<p>Mr. Hao is dead. Hao Guilin's death reflects the imperfection of China's entire organizational structure, and at the same time arouses doubts and sadness among engineers. In the future, who among engineers can guarantee that they will not encounter the same fate as Mr. Hao?</p>
<p>China needs construction, needs to revitalize **industry**, and absolutely cannot do without engineers. However, the status of engineers has not been improved because of the need for construction.</p>
<p>Although China currently lacks construction talent, it is not completely without it. Talent recalled from abroad cannot be used well and assigned to jobs. In this way, even if the whole country is full of talent, there will still be a lament of scarcity!</p>
<p>China will embark on the road of construction in the future and needs various talents in construction. If things continue like this, the future is unimaginable!</p>
<p>Mr. Hao's suicide will at least arouse infinite sympathy and sorrow among engineers, as well as emotional unease. Mr. Hao's death is not only a loss to the engineering world, but also a great loss to the country!</p>
<p>We shout: Improve the treatment of engineers, raise the status of engineers, and hope that such things will not happen again in the future. Then Mr. Hao, though dead, will be happy in the afterlife.</p>

<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>President Truman's daughter, Miss Margaret, recently graduated from the History Department of Washington University with a Bachelor of Arts degree; at the same time, her father received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Margaret said, "Dad, I studied hard for four years to get a diploma, but you got it effortlessly."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Talking About Servants <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>In ordinary families in Shanghai, it is indispensable to hire a servant to help with housework. However, in the wave of "labor supreme," hiring a loyal servant is very troublesome, and at the same time, one must also endure a lot of idleness. When many housewives talk about servants, eight or nine out of ten will frown and shake their heads, just like being "terrified at the mention of a tiger."</p>
<p>My family recently hired a 39-year-old woman through a neighbor's introduction because my mother was not feeling well. Under the condition of 30,000 yuan per month, she became my family's servant.</p>
<p>In the first few days, my mother was busier than usual, teaching this servant all the housework. Because she was very capable, she learned everything after being taught once. My mother was very happy and praised her greatly. This caused her to become proud, and her airs gradually grew.</p>
<p>This servant hates us calling her "Niang Yi" (a common term for a female servant). She thinks the word "Niang Yi" is very shameful. She wants us to call her "A San Niang," A San is the **son** of her ex-husband. Recently, she became acquainted with another vegetable vendor, and every Saturday night she would use the excuse of seeing her son to go back and have a rendezvous with that lover. She would only arrive late on Monday morning. So my family had to cook our own meals every Sunday. A San Niang also understood Western customs very well, and she took it upon herself to create a trend of "Sunday off for servants"!</p>
<p>Not only that, **we** also had to listen to two hours of Shanghai opera every night before she could sleep. So my family's radio was occupied by A San Niang. My mother did not interfere because "it's hard to hire a servant," and I could only swallow my anger. However, secretly, I had a war of radio program contention with her. I loved to listen to music, but she wanted to listen to Shanghai opera. When she couldn't hear it, she would grumble: "What's so good about music? It sounds like cats and dogs calling, Shanghai opera is more flavorful!"</p>
<p>A San Niang gradually complained that my family's wages were low, there was no "extra income," things were too busy, and there were too many people. Moreover, she often secretly took rice back, and clothes were often missing. Therefore, my mother despised her and fired her. When she left, she scolded my mother for having no conscience. So my mother vowed to never hire a servant again, and I strongly agreed!</p>
<p>Since that cunning A San Niang left, my family has become more harmonious and more harmonious. The radio has also been liberated; the rice has not been stolen. Although my mother is a little more tired, she is much happier than before when she was angry.</p>
<p>I feel that as long as time permits, it is better to do all the housework yourself. Servants will not bring you comfort; on the contrary, they will indirectly destroy the harmonious atmosphere in the family. Everyone has a pair of hands, why spend money to hire servants?</p>
<p>If the servants form a union and a strike occurs, then for those housewives who rely on servants and are unwilling to do anything themselves, many unimaginable difficulties will arise!</p>
<p>Lazy housewives! I worry about you!</p>
<h3 id="e134">Diet Day <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>The war brought victory to the Allies, and the war also brought famine to the world. It is said that famine is an inevitable phenomenon after the war, but it is also an unavoidable fact. Therefore, the Allied countries have the establishment of the Relief Administration, and China also has tens of millions of people waiting to die. These tens of millions of people have all escaped from the hands of the god of death of the war. I don't want to see that after the victory, they are still waiting to "die," then the tragedy of the fate of the Chinese people still needs to seek a final solution from the side of not being able to die well. What the Chinese people can and cannot do, the conclusion lies in this word "death." However, you don't have to worry, another group of Chinese people are complaining that the minced meat is not worthy of their appetite. Haven't the economic news in the newspapers these days been reporting that large wings are selling well? The price of things like North Mushrooms is still quite firm. Speaking of famine, I can't see anyone with a haggard face here, unless it's myself. On the contrary, the business of teahouses and restaurants is extremely good. If you go one step late, you can't find an empty seat, but only flies are customers at street food stalls. The situation is obviously different from wartime. During wartime, the citizens could only sacrifice to the five internal organs at the food stalls. According to the above statement, it can be known that the Chinese people have their own "eugenics," and only those who are uncompetitive (?) will be forced to the line of death. — I'm really not saying something lightly here.</p>
<p>However, it is undeniable that famine has become a universal phenomenon in the world, so the rich people in foreign countries are opening their mouths and shouting, asking everyone to go on a diet. Here today, all kinds of newspapers are following up with an echo in the social or feature articles. Everyone also stipulates that today is Diet Day, and the rice and grain saved from the diet are to prevent the current and future famine. However, should these rice and grains saved from the diet be stored at **home** by the households? Or donated to a relief organization? Everyone did not propose, and the newspaper did not have any follow-up. I think it is to ask everyone to save food, and let the people waiting to die wait to die. Because the people waiting to die are not only "waiting to die," but also simply deserve to die!</p>
<p>From practical observation, how much has been saved here on Diet Day? No one can tell anyone, because the crowded situation in the market has not been reduced by a single point. The teahouses, restaurants, and restaurants in the three markets of morning, noon, and evening are still crowded, and except for the beggars following people, anyone is full and fat, and even a drop of water has not been saved. It can be known that today's Diet Day is afraid that only the promoters have saved two pieces of bread, and the rest of the sentient beings have not reduced their "food and sex" at all. This really wrongs the newspapers for making this echo, and people often treat his voice as a dog bark.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Letter from Fan Jiping, Leader of the Star East Football Team <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Yesterday, your newspaper's "Free Talk" section in "News Small World" stated that after expenses for our team's matches in Shanghai, each team member could receive over five million yuan in rewards, which is greatly different from the facts. After checking, our team prepared for a month in Hong Kong before coming to Shanghai for sightseeing and to learn. In addition, the expenses for purchasing luggage, round-trip travel expenses, and expenses while staying in Shanghai are all considerable. We would be content if we did not lose money. How could we have extravagant hopes for further income?</p>
<p>What your newspaper published may be a joke based on hearsay, but a joke is a small matter, a misunderstanding is a big matter. If this causes misunderstandings among outsiders towards our team or among the players towards the organizers of our team, then it will be very difficult to explain and clarify. Therefore, I am writing this special letter to request</p>
<p>a correction. This is my sincere request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fan Jiping, Leader of the Star East Football Team, June 20th</p>
<p>Addressed to:</p>

<h3 id="e137">Eastern-Youth Match Decides the Australian Expedition List <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>There is also a secret behind the match between the Hong Kong Star East Football Team and the Qingbai team. In addition to the matches, the Star East team also wanted to win over a few players to go on an expedition to Australia. Because the Shanghai Qingbai team used to be members of the Eastern team in Hong Kong, and speaking of it, they were originally family, so the two teams had a considerable intention of re-joining forces. After several negotiations, the two sides could not agree because of different opinions. Originally, the Star East team had been invincible in its four matches in Shanghai and believed that it should take the initiative, only wanting to select four people from the Qingbai team to play supporting roles. The Qingbai team, on the other hand, believed that its own strength was strong and insisted on participating with six people. To outsiders, four people and six people may not seem to be very different, but in their minds, there is a great reason for this, because the official lineup of a football team is only eleven people. If the Qingbai team can occupy six seats, it will be in a dominant position. Therefore, the Star East team was unwilling to agree at that time, and the reason lies in this. At the same time, the main character and the supporting role, for the entire control aspect, whether it is the match or the funding, clearly know that there is a lot of room for profit, naturally no one wants to suffer losses. Since both sides are "widows raising children" - "old hands", it is naturally easy to become a deadlock. However, the progress of the matter did not "break up" as ideal, and everyone felt a strong interest in the good thing of going on an expedition to Australia after all. Therefore, the final negotiation decided to use the Qingbai match as the standard for allocating the number of people. That is to say: If Qingbai **wins**, **six people** will attend, otherwise, four people will go. So in the match the other day, **both** sides were particularly diligent, and there was a little reason for that. As a result, Qingbai unexpectedly overwhelmed Star East 3-1, creating an absolute advantage, so it is expected that the list of names for the expedition to Australia will be dominated by Qingbai, it can also be said that this is the victory that Qingbai's sweat and labor have earned.</p>

<p>Senior naval veteran Admiral Sa Zhenbing, having reached a great age, still labors for the country, and his spirit is vigorous. He uses poetry to pass the time after official duties, showing his elegance and refinement. Earlier, my old friend Qin Bowei, after reading Admiral Sa's "Gems of Leisure", composed three poems in the five-character-regular-verse style, which I sent to Fujian. Admiral Sa replied, stating that **Mr.** Qin is skilled in medicine, possessing three perfections, and has a heroic reputation. Now I will record Admiral Sa's reply poems:</p>
<p>Having served in the military for fifty years, I am ashamed of my meager contribution.</p>
<p>In my old age, I am particularly worried about the country, and I always uphold fairness when discussing talent.</p>
<p>Neighboring soldiers still oppress the border, and border officials rarely call themselves heroes.</p>
<p>When will the struggle for land end? The battlefield is dyed red with blood.</p>
<p>Battles near and far are raging, teachers and students have labored for ten years.</p>
<p>What we seek is to secure the nation, not to acquire grapes.</p>
<p>Decisively win over a thousand miles, and resolve the complexities with a single stroke.</p>
<p>Let us take advantage of this day to revitalize the country, and work together with our compatriots.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Central Bank Heist: Who Pays for the Advertising Fee? <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>I was very pleased to see the headline in a certain newspaper: "Central Printing Plant Stops Printing Banknotes." But when I saw a small headline in the next line, "Will Be Printed in the United States and **Returned** Later," I was despondent again.</p>
<p>The suppression of opium is carried out with great force and vigor. It is said that after this month, anyone who is arrested will be severely punished. People on the blacklist are mostly uneasy. However, there are also those who hope to get away with it and remain optimistic. Their view is that "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no road, there is another village with shady willows and bright flowers," and they will find a way out of desperation at that time.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the Central Bank's large theft case, the police authorities have been investigating everywhere for a long time without capturing the main culprit. The bank has been running wanted advertisements in various newspapers for days, and this expense is quite considerable. Although the bank has a reason to pay for it and can list it as a proper expense, since this case has been reported to the public security authorities for handling, then which party should be responsible for this considerable advertising fee?</p>
<p>The public bond market has recently experienced extreme volatility. Securities and stocks have fallen sharply in a straight line. It is rumored that sixteen securities firms have gone bankrupt one after another, with a total debt of 2.6 billion. This is a major blow to speculators, but among these 2.6 billion, there are many ordinary citizens who covet high interest loans. It is always the ordinary citizens who suffer, unfairly and in vain.</p>
<p>It is said that Mayor Wu has paid close attention to the solicitation advertisements in the newspapers. It is expected that playing-card-style solicitation advertisements will soon disappear. However, Shanghainese are best at adapting to circumstances and playing tricks. Let's see what new tricks will appear.</p>

<p>We earnestly appeal to people from all walks of life to actively promote and promote righteousness in disaster relief, as if saving from fire. The sooner the better, the merit is immeasurable.</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Xiang Disaster Relief Committee says:</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Since the establishment of our committee, we have been actively preparing to launch a Xiang Disaster Relief campaign. In addition to distributing donation booklets and raising funds, we will also hold a joint charity performance for the Xiang disaster in northern Jiangsu and invite **Qing** and other four teams to hold a football charity match in the coming days, hoping to raise huge sums of money in a short period of time to urgently help the disaster-stricken people. We have long admired your newspaper for advocating **righteousness** and always being a social leader in the state. We hereby sincerely request you to raise your pen and call for donations to help millions of victims out of famine. Those who are grateful will not only be the suffering people, but also, sincerely ask, to the Zhong Bao.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The drought in Hunan Province has been prolonged and has not rained, and the disaster situation is very serious. Starving people are everywhere and cannot guarantee the evening! This newspaper has repeatedly used photos and text to make urgent appeals, hoping that people on the coast can save on disaster relief and donate more to fulfill the grand aspiration of "doing good is the most **important**". Now that we have accepted the entrustment of the Xiang Disaster Relief Committee, we will do our best to handle it. Starting today, we will start accepting donations from all walks of life to send urgent aid to the disaster area. The names of all donors, whether organizations or individuals, will be published to show credibility. This newspaper has always attached great importance to social justice. It has been like this in the past and will continue to be so in the future. At this difficult time, it is precisely to fulfill the duty of humanity, to serve the country and the people, and to serve the society. We do not want to use this as a slogan. We hope that our vast readers will work together to advocate and promote and enthusiastically promote and promote this **sincere and** great righteous act. We pay our respects to the victims nine times!</p>

<p>(1) Huang **asks** Mr. Editor: Please show some mercy, answer a few questions, and save me from my suffering! I have only been in Shanghai for more than 20 days. I am unfamiliar with the place and I am a worker. Due to limited money and time, I cannot solve my problems. Because your newspaper has a service **corner**, please give me an answer, I am very grateful. (Symptoms) There is a polyp in my nasal cavity, which some people call a nasal polyp, or **mushroom**. It is slowly growing, making both **nostrils** blocked and unable to breathe. I breathe through my mouth and often have yellow nasal discharge. My head often hurts. I have had it surgically removed once, but it relapsed two or three years later. May I ask: (1) Which hospital or private doctor is the best in Shanghai? (2) Can this disease be cured completely without recurring? (3) Is this disease dangerous? (4) What should I pay attention to usually?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] (1) The otolaryngology departments of Shanghai Municipal Hospitals have specialized doctors in charge of treatment (such as the Fourth Hospital) near Hongkou, which is close to your factory. (2) It must be treated surgically. (3) This disease is not dangerous for the time being. If it is not treated, it may develop **pus** in the future. (4) You must follow the doctor's instructions.</p>
<p>(2) Wang Haoran asks: I often play basketball in the summer, and I feel a heavy heartbeat after exercise. Recently, even if I don’t play basketball, I feel the same way, and I sometimes have stabbing pains. My heart feels swollen and painful. When I am a little nervous, such as watching a play or gambling, my heartbeat will shake my whole body. Sometimes I am awakened by a heartbeat at night. Please give me an answer and a good way to treat it. I will be grateful and never forget it.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] Please go to the Department of Internal Medicine of a municipal hospital for a detailed examination to see if you have heart disease or beriberi (i.e., lack of vitamin B).</p>
<p>(3) Shi Hao asks: Since the beginning of spring, my right leg has suddenly felt severe pain. At first, I thought it was a muscle strain. After consulting a doctor, it was said to be sciatica. I took oral and injected Hovalgin, and although the severe pain has stopped after two months, there is still a slight ache and a feeling of numbness, from my foot up. It is even worse when I sit, which is quite painful. I don't know if there is any way to recover quickly? Please ask your doctor to give detailed instructions.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] In addition to oral medication and injections for sciatica, shortwave electrotherapy can be used. It is best to check the pressure and urine, and check for cavities.</p>

<p>Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution: The Shanghai East Community Center, located at 1509 Yangshupu Road and established by Shanghai University, has served the community and labor compatriots for over thirty years. During the War of Resistance, it particularly distinguished itself in relief efforts. Now, with the weather being hot and many impoverished people in the area, the Center has specially partnered with local enthusiastic individuals to offer free clinics and medicine distribution at the Center from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, starting from the 24th of this month. All impoverished patients are welcome to seek medical attention. Local Chinese pharmacies will also sell medicine at affordable prices, which is truly a blessing for the poor and sick during this time of high medical costs.</p>
<p>Lost NT Dollars: To the Editor, The other day, my wife found over three thousand NT dollars on the road at the intersection of Avenue Road and Wenzhou Road. Fearing that the loser would have nowhere to look, I am writing to your newspaper to help find the owner. If no one claims it within three days, the money will be donated to Xiang disaster relief, benefiting the loser. Respectfully, Jin Ruheng.</p>
<p>Lost Watch: Our theater found a men's watch in the theater during the first show on the 10th. We have been waiting for three days, but no one has claimed it.
