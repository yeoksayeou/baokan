<p>〔本報南京七日電〕共軍在山西方面發動之猛烈攻勢，現已陷大同於危急中，共軍發動兵力，達三十餘萬，分由賀龍蕭克指揮，四日攻陷大同西二十公里之口泉鎭煤礦，並繼續猛攻大同東郊五公里之明福權飛機塲，當被其攻陷，平旺之發電廠亦被佔，大同城內電源斷絕，共軍實有不顧一切犧牲，而奪取大同之決心，故大同實已危急萬分。</p>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕大同緊急聲中，今日上午記者特訪馬占山將軍於其北平私邸，據稱昨日下午，曾得電報，大同西南口泉被佔後，平旺發電廠亦被共軍攻陷，現大同電源已斷，入夜一片黑暗，城北孤山現正激戰中，城東曹福樓朱家莊海動村沙嶺等十餘據點，俱在激戰中，大同城東之飛機塲，現在威脅下，難於降落飛機，故軍事接濟，已感困難，守軍糧食燃料稍有儲存，尚可支持一時，惟十數萬人民的食糧燃料，則甚成問題，圍攻之共軍，據報約達三十個團，守軍則東北挺進軍二師及若干地方團隊，實力頗嫌單薄。</p>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕爲配合晋北之攻勢，共軍已向山西與平津惟一紐帶之正太鐵路發動全綫攻擊，該路前日起已不通，石家莊西行車僅通微水，共軍攻擊係於三日夜開始，攻擊上湖白羊墅，陽泉，段廷，盧家莊，馬首，亂流，下盤石，東趙等車站俱被猛攻，其中白羊站業已陷落，若干處橋梁，已被破壞。</p>
<p>〔中社北平七日電〕軍息，大同週圍戰事，仍在猛烈進行，城東海力村朱家莊遭夫樓及沙嶺等十餘據點，仍在激戰，飛機塲附近之水泊寺，已於日前被共產軍攻佔，目前共軍最切迫之企圖，似在破壞及佔領大同飛機塲。又山西懷仁縣城，及辛泉，已被共軍第六團攻佔。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原七日電〕共軍於改向大同西南之口泉鎭進犯，經國軍奪勇堵擊，將其擊退，五日共軍復大量增援猛犯，激戰終日，國軍因眾寡懸殊，略向東北轉移，該鎭遂被共軍攻陷，大同情况，至爲緊張。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原六日電〕關於共軍連日在正太綫襲擊國軍，攻佔車站事，此間當局六日晨十時半分在軍調部太原中心小組三方代表例會時，由小組政府代表正式向小組提出，聞小組對此已交付雙方指揮官代表，予以直接商談，然雙方指揮官代表今又未行集議。又據記者獲悉，小組定八日晨十時三十分邀請雙方代表舉行聯席會議，屆時將聽取日來雙方直接商談之經過。</p>
<h3 id="c2">蘇北共軍走下策　武力比賽不澈底　國軍不被襲决不反擊　陳總長招待記者說明眞相 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺七日電〕「和平商談無成效，　結在共產黨不履行諾言，今日共產黨高唱之全面停戰，局部停戰，及改組政府，如共黨担保不再背信棄約，余仍可代表政府與之再簽協定。」此爲參謀總長陳誠七日下午五時半在牯嶺首次記者招待會中所宣示者。陳總長今日曾就牯嶺記者共同提出之問題，作詳盡解答，關於和平商談，總長除宣示前述意見外，並謂，退出蘇北，實施整軍，恢復交通，仍爲繼續和平商談中急須實現之主題，並先就蘇北軍事形勢作一槪括說明，國軍爲防再被襲擊，現攻守調整後之揚州海安一綫國軍，仍恪遵命令，不被襲不反擊，亦不出擊，惟共軍遲遲不由蘇北向隴海以北地區撤退，所予京滬威脅甚大，余與共產黨代表會議中，對蘇北一案，曾獻三計，上策爲共軍退出，中策爲國府遷都，下策爲武力決賽。上策共軍不願履行，中策國府甫於五五還都，未便再遷，結果走下策，又未走到底，衹有共軍打人，國軍挨打，並未眞正決賽。依空軍視察報告，共軍在蘇北將運沭兩河決堤，後蘇北已有五個地區盡成澤國，人民多攀登樹根屋頂逃生，慘不忍睹。記者提問曰：然則政府坐視不救乎？陳總笑答曰：余當尊重民主，請諸位公議。繼謂：余半生戎馬，在八年抗戰中，未出風頭，豈願打自己來出風頭，即以餘爲參謀總長而言，果眞發生戰事，則給養，彈藥，療傷，恤死種種麻煩，紛至沓來，余之體力，實難勝任，所謂「兵兇戰危」，並非反戰主義之喜言，故政府爲解除京滬威脅，爲拯救蘇北人民，仍不惜盡最後人事，請共產黨遵令退出蘇北，撤至隴海以北地區。至實施整軍，爲建軍建國必由之路，恢復交通爲生產建設先決條件，共產黨亦必須切實履行其諾言。</p>
<p>某記者詢以共軍又有開決運河五壩之議，不識確否？總長答謂：周恩來先生以運河漲水，曾向行政院提出備忘錄，要求開放運河五壩，余意值茲長江洪澤湖均告水漲，開放運河五壩後能否容納其排泄流量，應由雙方及專家會勘。陳總長又謂：余與周恩來先生私交甚篤，向不作攻擊性之中傷，共軍在蘇北決堤殃民，恐非恩來先生所能預知，亦非恩來先生所能結束，易言之，恩來先生今日之言行，能否代表整個共產黨，能否爲共產黨所信守，殊成疑問。</p>
<p>陳總長結束此一答案後，復答記者詢問多起：（問）總長今日與馬帥晤談內容可得告乎？（答）馬帥對政府實施整軍進度，開懷甚誠，余告以現有五十九個師整編完竣，其他時間所談之一課，餘知諸位未能料到，即余亦未料到，蓋馬帥以電影教育垂詢甚詳也。（問）共產黨反美意義如何？（答）余以私人資格發言，共產黨製造類似義和團性質之安平事件以反美，旣失中國人人格，又不懂做人道理，共產黨一面求人幫助，一面加以殺傷，出爾反爾，前後矛盾，實不敢茍同，（問）偵查李聞案有無進展？（答）余敢斷言此案非高級知識份子所爲，將來破案以後，不論主兇何人政府必予嚴懲。</p>
<p>今日之記者招待會，陳總長極感愉快輕鬆，國防部新聞局長亦在座，並備有豐富茶點。</p>

<p>〔本報南京七日電〕司徒大使昨晚與周恩來作五小時之長談後，今日並無何活動。司徒大使上午除以外交慣例拜會墨西哥大使外。下午曾接見共產黨代表團之王炳南，談半小時，旋於下午五時半招待外國記者，並聞軍事參議院院長龍雲，將於明日上午往訪。頃據有關方面人士談稱：安平事件曾爲昨日司徒與周恩來會談中之重要主題，周恩來表示爲一不幸事件外，僅作强詞之解釋，惟司徒大使目前正靜待美國輿論之反響，且不欲以正事而影響於國共間之和平談判。司徒大使以宗教信徒之虔誠心理，始終祈求不久可能重來之光明。又對於改組政府一事，政府現正就目前之情形，予以考慮中。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕司徒雷登大使六日晚與中共代表周恩來歷五小時之長談，據與大使接近人士談稱，昨夜談話，多爲舊事重提，曾就政治協商會以來停止軍事衝突，恢復交通，改組政府等有關問題之　結，逐一檢討，並交換意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕據某權威人士稱：共方曾迭提苛刻之要求，然已爲政府拒絕，而過去商談迄無結果之整編與軍隊駐地數問題，政府方面最近聞亦曾有一新的意見提出，然共產黨以旣定方針不容改變，堅不接受，故就目前情况觀之，實已陷於僵局，無商談之可能。至若共產黨一再强調之美軍必須撤退一節，有識人士認爲即使在華美軍全部撤退，其對現局亦不致發生任何影響，且美方人士決不願以國共間之問題轉變爲中美之邦交問題。據聞：司徒大使除一面報呈美國務院不使事態擴大外，現正靜待白宮方面之訓示，以定決策。</p>

<p>〔本報特派員華盛頓七日專電〕安平事件發生後，美國輿論尚相當鎭靜，自美國務院發言人五日宣布美國對華政策並無變更後，紐約前鋒論壇報及華盛頓郵報均有社論，擁護美軍繼續駐華，謂美軍一旦撤退，中國必更混亂，美軍固不應用於參加中國「內戰」，但美軍駐華，多少可以促成中國從事於擴大政府，容納自由份子參加政權。記者默察美國輿論，雖不贊成改變對華政策，但要求政府再闡明其政策，使之更明朗化，而不致被人誤解。大槪，美國報紙及無綫電廣播評論家，對中國問題，意見原非一致，反對共產黨者有之，反對國民黨者有之，主張美國應始終調解國共爭端者有之，主張美國完全退出中國者亦有之。例如（一）紐約時報所代表的穩健派，認爲國民政府乃中國唯一合法政府，故美國應以全力支持國民政府，造成和平安定局面，使其　負雜繁遠東和平之任務。（二）紐約前鋒論壇報所代表的自由，則主張美國應用其全力，　成中國建立一「聯合政府」，使國民黨內外之自由份子有掌握政權之機會。（三）斯克里浦斯霍華德系各報，堅持美國不應受人恫嚇即撤手不管中國問題，而任憑蘇聯假共產黨之手以宰割中國，因而危及整個太平洋區域之和平。（四）代表最左路綫之美國共產黨及其同路人，如每日工人報等，醜詆國民政府爲「腐化政權」，故美軍應早撤退，援華物資應早停運，以促成國民政府之崩潰，便利共產黨取而代之。（五）代表最右路綫之份子，如反對共產主義之教徒，素以專論反蘇反共之赫斯特系報紙及孤立派，國家主義派報紙如芝加哥論壇報及紐約每日新聞等，一方面大唱反蘇論調，一方面又主張美國應閉關自守，不管他國閒事。由此可知極端的左右派均主撤退美軍，而溫和自由的中間派均反對撤兵。最可注意者，美國各報，各通訊社駐華記者之報道，往往足以影響美國一部份人民之意見，我政府及社會各界，應隨時以充分資料供給於彼輩，使彼輩能以中國政局之眞相及眞正人民之希望，報告美國朝野。比較美國報紙有影響力量者，目前爲紐約時報及紐約前鋒論壇報，後者認爲中共在軍事上將遭遇失敗，而被迫採取游擊戰，如國民黨能將其以前在宣言及決議案中所作之各種改革諾言切實執行，則對消除中國共產主義之威脅，必較武力更有成功之希望。美國對華政策協會，亦爲美國深明中國情况人士最近發動之組織，彼等不以美國政府過分抬高中共地位，一味强迫國民政府接受共黨條件作無限制之讓步爲然。其贊助人中有美國勞工同盟協會會長葛林，前美國駐華紅十字會會長貝克等人。</p>

<p>〔本報南京七日電〕宣傳部彭部長及國防部白部長，應外記者之請，將備一專機，載各記者飛往蘇北·皖北共軍破壞河堤，釀成水災地區上空視察，此舉定九日上午實現。</p>
<p>蘇北豫鄂</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防部白部長崇禧，今日在中宣部外記者招待會席上，報告各地軍事現况，據稱：蘇北沿津浦綫戰事，自收復如皋·天長·旴眙各地以後，共軍以攻勢頓挫，趁黃河淮河夏季泛濫暴漲，在隴海綫南淮陰以北地區決口四處，此一片汪洋，除陷百萬民眾別其家園於水深之中外，共軍之進攻擾亂及國軍之行動均受其影響，蘇北各綫因之已略行緩和；至豫鄂邊區方面，李先令部五萬餘，於月前分爲四股向豫西陝南竄犯，但以豫西地方民團制度夙稱健全，共軍未能盤據任何城鎭，此五萬眾經團軍堵擊之後，多潰散或被俘，僅餘七千餘，其中一千五百人由李先念率領，現逃至陝南泰嶺之山陽縣境。</p>
<p>東北情形</p>
<p>關於東北情形，白部長稱，東北自停戰後，已寗靜多時，蓋共軍自山海關。本溪湖及四平街三次大會戰失敗後，已知其實力單薄，乃一方組織民眾加緊訓練，一方自山東運軍隊前往，擴充勢力，故前次杜建明長官邀晤林彪之際，林氏僅遣李立三爲代表，携來政府不能考慮之苛求條件，不使談判護致任何成就，藉以宕延時日，而圖遂其上述之企圖，但東北地區富庶無比，人民多可安居樂業，獨立生活，共產思想實難發生任何效果也。</p>
<p>共黨陰謀</p>
<p>關於國軍派飛機炸毀在延安郊外被防軍扣留之飛機一事，並未引起人民生命財產之任何損失，故此乃無足注意之事；至於安平伏兵襲擊美海軍人員，爲共產黨處心積慮之謀略，欲以迷惑美國輿論，迫使美政府撤退駐華美軍，美海軍之無端被襲，此與各處國軍之被襲事出一轍，此事顯明指出共產黨對於和平商談，實毫不措意，商談之繼續與成功，受此暴行之損失甚大，吾人讀八月五日美國國務院發言人之聲明，至爲愉快，蓋此聲明證明美國政府對於中國局勢情報正確，而不受迷惑。</p>
<p>共方藉口</p>
<p>紐約時報記者李普曼，詢問共產黨方而於七月十日在蘇北發動攻勢之際，曾謂政府已計劃在蘇北猛攻，故而先發制人，是否確實？白部長答稱：此完全不確，共產黨是項聲明實係一强辭奪理之藉口，政府方面從未計劃進攻共軍，但政府爲保障人民，維護社會治安，自不能不採有效之行動，抑止共軍之攻擊。</p>
<p>調整待遇</p>
<p>又據彭部長在外記者招待會上宣佈，今晨政府決定調整公務員待遇增加百分之五十以上，此次自動而提早調整之理由，一因本年七月法幣發行已無增加，此爲抗戰以來未有之現象，表示國家財政已日臻健全；二因近來除輸入品普遍跌價之外，以秋季豐收關係，各省糧價已普遍下跌，故提高待遇，不致影響物價，此次提高固尚不能解決公務員待遇問題，然亦可說明公務員之生活，固無日不在政府當局焦慮之中也</p>

<h3 id="c26">美國對華政策不變 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>美國國務院發言人本月五日聲稱：目前美國對華政策，仍一如代理國務卿艾克遜六月廿八日所宣布者，並無變更。又謂南京傳來美總統已訓令計劃撤退在華美軍之謠諑，並不正確。這是很關重要的一種聲明。</p>
<p>自從安平的「不幸事件」發生以後，盛傳美國對華政策將有變更。中共對安平事件一方面自承爲「遺憾」，而另一方面却反向美軍部提出抗議，謂根本辦法在於美軍自華撤退。不消說，一般爲中共宣傳所麻醉的朋友，不問在中國在美國，也會如響斯應地鼓吹美國改變對華政策，撤軍離華，不再過問中國的事。好像中共半年以來所計劃着的「驅逐美國勢力於中國之外」，行將成熟，可以如他們之所願。現在經美國務院發言人的鄭重聲明，當中使局勢爲之澄淸。</p>
<p>的確，我們看得出：美國朝野正爲中國問題而感覺困擾。但我們敢向美國盟友坦白地指陳：美國在戰時與中國併肩作戰，在戰後這樣協助中國作和平統一的努力，無非希望中國能成爲一個統一，民主，强盛的國家，在遠東能擔負起聯合國一員的任務，共同維持世界和平，我們中國的政府和人民，無論如何，一定向這個目標努力，決不會辜負自己，更不會辜負美國以及其他盟國的好意。中國目前正在過渡時期，正在學習民主，而且正在向民主政治的大道前進。所不幸的，就是有一個武裝的共產黨，還自恃其武裝，而不願遵循政協的決議，以及停止衝突，恢復交通，整編軍隊等方案，逐一實行，以致和平統一的局面，還要待相當時日，但是，正如馬帥和司徒大使之所見，只要「不以變態影響常態」，大家不受「安平事件」的刺激，始終向着原定目標努力，我們還是相信中國大局是有希望的。</p>
<p>世界和平不可分割，美國已經不能再孤立了！這是舉世周知的大勢，也是美國朝野有識之士的共同認識，國務卿貝爾納斯最近就有這樣顯明的宣告。因此，美國對中國大局決不能袖手旁觀；然亦惟其如此，美國鑒於馬帥半年以上的努力尚未能完滿達成其任務，不免深感焦慮。美國前副國務卿威爾斯七月二十八日的談話，率直指出中共領袖對於彼等與中央政府間之爭執，所以拒絕同意採取平等而具建設性之解決辦法的原因；這正是美國眞正感到困擾的焦點所在。大槪言之，美國輿論對中國問題的主張，恰如本報昨日華盛頓專電所傳，也頗不一致，有的反對共產黨，有的反對國民黨，有的主張美國應始終爲國共雙方調解，有的主張美國應速完全退出中國。我們深知道，美國朝野對中國存有一種期望，即由國早日統一民主而强盛，完全是一片好意，故不論他們的主張如何，不過是他們看法或有所不同，而並非對中國懷有絲毫惡感。但無論如何，我們中國報人有使美國眞正瞭解中國局勢的義務。我們敢說：世界的戰亂，往往起因於國際的隔閡，而國際的隔閡，則一半由於若十好戰之徙的挑撥離間，一半由於國與國間新聞報道之未盡確實，以及純正輿論之未能充分交換。所以我們在深信美國對華政策不變的大前提下，仍認爲中國的知識份子，不論其爲報人，爲教育界，爲企業家，在此時應該直率坦白　供其對國事的正當意見，以備美國與其他盟國瞭解中國局勢之一助。</p>
<p>我們的意見，簡單說來，只有下列幾點：（一）中國需要統一，更需要和平。衹有在統一和平的局面下，中國纔可走上民主强盛的大道，纔可使國力與民生復蘇，纔可確　聯合國一員所應負的任務。我們相信中國人民這種希望，國民政府的當局看得很真切，而日寇投降以來，國民政府也確在向着這目標努力。外面所傳國民黨中有若干反動份子或頑固派與美國反動份子勾結，阻撓着和平統一，我們以爲這是中共若干年來歪曲宣傳的一慣技倆，而絕非事實。國民黨的建國計劃，分軍政訓政專政三時期，而今天的程序，已經到了由訓政而進於憲政的階段。國民黨素來不主張「一黨專政」到底的，在今天更無排斥他黨的企圖。只要看國民政府先　容納無黨無派的賢達，以及切望早日召集國民大會還政於民，就可知道頑固派阻碍民主這種說法之無稽。</p>
<p>（二）中國和平統一之成功，決不是靠單方面的努力所能獲得。國民政府固切望和平統一，但武裝的共產黨究竟怎樣呢？時人往往喜以中決兩國相比擬，以爲法國戰後如何團結，如何一躍而爲歐洲的均衡力量，乃歎息於中國之不爭氣。不過我們要請回憶去年日寇投降以後不久密勒氏評論報所披露鮑威爾的一篇論文，中國有與法國情形不盡相同之處。法國沒有一個武裝的共產黨，此其一。法國共產黨願意在和平環境下作政爭的競選，而不倚賴游擊隊或地下軍，明揭叛亂的旗幟，此其二。法國爲共同佔領德國的四强之一，而法國國境並不與蘇聯壤地相接，更沒有像外蒙獨立以及新疆東北等事件的發生，此其三。總之，中國與法國處境不盡同，而中國政府在中蘇同盟友好條約簽訂之後，無時無地不願恪守條約，與蘇聯成爲三十年友好相處的盟國，尤其願意在遠東問題上能够成爲美蘇兩盟邦携手共維世界和平的橋樑。這是有目共覩的事實，然而欲達成此崇高之任務，必須使中共顧到國家民族的立塲，實行整編統編的方案，將軍隊完全交給國家，將它自己改成一個普通政黨，然後中國纔眞能負起此項任務。這一點如做不到，中共倘仍處處挾有異圖，始終想造成一個分裂騷亂的中國，那末中國的不能早日和平統一，責任誰屬，不辨自明了。</p>
<p>（三）在中共沒有改變它的態度以前，我們預料中共的反對國民政府，甚至反對美國遣將層出不窮。而美國爲其所激，一旦撤兵，就將鑄成大錯。中共本來是切望着：由於它的歪曲宣傳，可能使美國極端用壓力加諸國民政府，接受中共一切不合情理的要求。故當馬帥來華之初，稱之爲「和平天使」，當司徒大使發表新任命之際，也表示異常歡迎。但一旦感覺美國的對華政策是公正而不偏袒的，就反對美國代表的公斷權了，就綁架天津的美兵了，就襲擊經過安平的美海軍陸戰隊了，就大叫大嚷美國反動份子幫助中國「內戰」了，就到處鼓吹美國必須從速撤退駐華軍隊了。換言之，美國如能偏助中共，中共就歡迎；反之，美國如公正不偏，中共就反美。他們希望美軍撤退以後，就可在東北，華北，乃至全中國開始其「全面叛亂」，而中國可能成爲一個分裂的局面。只要看這幾天山西大同的圍攻，熱河境內的騷動，以及淮陰的華中新華日報煸動全面性游擊戰爭的社論，就可窺見中共企圖的一斑。故紐約前鋒論壇報與華盛頓郵報六日的社論，指出駐華美軍此時不能撤退的理由，在於防止中國政治軍事與經濟的混亂，防止各交通線的切斷，實在是中肯的話。</p>
<p>總之，我們以爲中國確實需要和平，而第一自然要使目前中共所揑造的戰亂不再擴大。美軍的駐華，就可協助中國完成這任務。我們固然不希望美軍永久駐在中國，尤其不願因中國的問題而長此連累美國，但此時美軍駐華，猶負有其協助中國遣送敵俘亂僑，以及恢復和平秩序的任務。　中國和平計，爲世界和平計，我們同意美國貫澈其公允而具有建設性的對華政策。</p>
<h3 id="c27">勝利後首屆父親節 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>中國之有父親節，不是今日始；但今日是勝利後的首屆父親節，自父親節的誕生到它的被世界各國所採行的一個重要日子。回憶中國之有父親節，實始於民國三十四年八月八日，發起者爲上海各界領袖顏惠盛袁希濂等十人，其時正當遠東最後決戰，敵寇倡狂，環境險惡，此一父親節的發起，實爲懷念和國之暗示；故而各領袖登高一呼，羣眾響應，當時在上海曾經有熱烈的父親節的舉行。其後河山光復，各界名流潘公展，李石曾，宋漢章等十人，以父親節之舉行爲抗戰期間民族正氣之純正表示，大有提倡必要，爰乃呈請本市當局轉呈中央，准予規定八月八日爲父親節，通令全國遵行，其呈文中句云：「…父親節之發起，純係抗戰期間民族自覺之一種純正表示，足與美國第一次歐戰後發起之母親節，並行不悖，映帶生輝，爲紀念抗戰史　計，爲纍尚民族道德計，自應由中央明令規定，永爲令節」。如今又逢這意義深長的父親節，雖中央的明令未　，而人民對於這紀念父恩的父親節，其情緒郤更爲欣奮。此父親節的發動雖在上海，然以其意義深長，深信全國人民定必聞風共起，即世界其它各地的人民，亦必能相率繼起，以熱烈的情緒來紀念父親節，以與第一次世界大戰後所發起的母親節後先輝映，來發揚人類崇高的至愛。</p>
<p>就中國人民的立塲來說，爲我們八年長期的苦鬥，留下一　永恒的紀念，實莫善於父親節的舉行。兵是凶事，兩國構兵，不一定全是人民的意向，中國受日本軍閥的侵略，雖歷時最久，爲害最烈，但我們郤不能以此而認爲日本全部人民均懷侵華之意；在他們之中，何嘗不也有攝於軍閥的　威，故乃供軍閥的役使。我們如欲爲這次中日戰事留一永恒的紀念，必使這紀念同爲中日人民所樂受。在我們八年的苦鬥中雖不乏英烈的日子，可爲我們這一民族戰爭留下永恒的紀念；但只有這父親節的舉行，纔能把握住中國人民的情意，日本人民的情意，而成爲中日兩國人民共同可紀念的令節。中國人有父親，日本人也有父親；父親節誕生於中日戰爭期內，使中國人民可以聯想到抗戰期內所遭逢的苦難，使日本人民可以聯想到他們當年如何供軍閥的役使，發動侵華，以致有今日的敗亡。這一令節的舉行，應該可以使中日兩國人民有更進一層的認識；所以我們以父親節來作爲我們八年長期苦鬥的紀念，實在最爲相宜。</p>
<p>但父親節的舉行，自然不完全在紀念抗戰；這裏還具有發揚光大我國固有美德的至意。自從「打倒孔家店」，提倡「非孝」之說起，我國固有的倫理道德，頻遭打擊，致使我國民道德的水準日趨低落。一個國家之所以有立，論其終極，必賴道德以爲維繫。西歐以及蘇聯其它各地，雖沒有如我們這樣的倫理制度，其人民所受基督教的影響却極深，而基督教的教條與我國傳統的倫理觀念實極爲接近。基督教裏所說的「愛」，原包括有我們的「孝」。「孝」與「愛」本是二而一的東西。西歐各國，它們的物質文明極爲發達，若使沒有基督教的精神文明來做它們的骨幹，眞不曉得將變成怎樣一個世界。我們的長期抗戰如今旣已結束，國家正向建國的大道中邁進，在這個時候，尤應將我國固有而善良的傳統道德恢復過來，使我們的建國大業能够有一種優良的精神基礎。在恢復我國固有道德的努力上，這個父親節的舉行，無疑地，必將有裨益於世道人心。風氣所樹，可以一新國人耳目，以一種新的姿態，新的風格，將我國的傳統美德表揚出來。</p>
<p>父親節之定在八月八日，不僅因爲八八連綫，形同父字，而音又與爸爸二字近似，這裏或另其一番深義。八月天氣，正在盛夏，烈日當空，父母之揮汗終日，辛勤工作不懈者，原有望於其子女；而爲子女者在長夏炎炎之中，倘一念及父母之辛勤，當更思所以答報之道。八月是學年的歲尾年頭，轉瞬秋凉，莘莘學子，又將紛紛入學。我們於此際來紀念我們的父親，思所以報答之道，莫善於助學金的捐募。助人成材，實是最大的快樂。這次抗戰勝利後首屆父親節的舉行，同時，尚擬舉行助學金的徴募，我們希望「孝親」之志，能够踴躍有所捐輸，這是紀念父親答報父親深恩的最好方法。</p>
<p>末了，由於我們有父親節的舉行，我們希望我們這種精神，能够感召西歐及各國人士，也於同日能有父親節的舉行。母親節的發起在世界第一次戰後，如今第二次世界大戰終了，在世界各處有多少父親不能見他的愛子，有多少子女不能見他們慈祥的父親回來。他們或者在太平洋的荒島上，在非洲的沙漠上，或是在遼遠的各處，以累累靑塚對着曉風殘月。我們要紀念他們，這是他們的死，纔有我們的活。這個父親節發動在受侵略之害最深的中國，這是中國人民答報盟邦協助的一種禮物；我們希望此後第二第三代乃至以後各代的父親，能够沒有像我們這一代所遭逢到的遭遇。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日緊急廣播：規程委會主席史巴克頃宣佈：有關表決程序之修正案，業經會議一致通過。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日廣播：規程委會今日下午開會時，南斯拉夫所提修正建議竟未遭反對，主席史巴克對此表示驚異。南斯拉夫提議凡有關國家之建議未能在和會內獲得採納者，可逕提交四强外長會議，該項修正建議，刻己一致在會中通過。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日廣播：今日和會開會時，澳代表伊瓦特表示願將澳洲所提表決程序修正案案撤回。荷蘭代表史達根堡亦作同樣申明。英外次麥克尼爾立即祝頌主席史巴克所作促進妥協之成功。會場內氣氛轉趨和緩，各代表亦充份表現其偉大之妥協精神。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕規程委會昨日　夜會議三次，最後一次會議於翌晨二時半始行結束。當將英國對於和會表決規則之修正案，以十五票對六票通過。該項修正案規定和會議案分為兩類：一類由過半數通過，另一類由三分之二多數通過，兩類議案均須提交四外長會議審核。先是法代表提出附帶修正案，被以十三票對八票否決。又荷蘭代表提議規程委會之表決應採過半多數制，亦被以十票對九票否決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕和會規程委會昨夜經四小時會議後，將議程中最棘手之問題，即表決規則問題予以解決。和會各代表今晨胸襟為之一暢。昨日午前會議時，美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫爭辯甚烈，和會公開破裂之危機有擴大之勢。</p>
<p>裂痕益見擴大　主席促成妥協</p>
<p>迨至午後會議時貝爾納斯與南斯拉夫代表卡特吉，又作唇槍舌劍之爭，裂痕益見擴大。所幸委會主席即此外長史巴克勇敢以赴，卒能促成妥協。史氏在晚間會議前，曾與各首席代表商談十五分鐘，史氏認識一時難以成立協議，爰決定晚間會議恢復公開討論。史氏在整整兩個小時中，竭力謀求妥協，但均被一連串之問題，干涉·建議·要求·及說明所包圍，辯論非但無進展反而呈倒退之勢。尤其可注意者，即午前會議時美國與蘇聯代表之始終敵對態度，至晚間會議時，演化而為英國與蘇聯代表團間之尖銳對立。英國兩主要代表即海相亞歷山大與外次麥克尼爾出辭嚴峻，但蘇代表莫洛托夫與維辛斯基亦以牙還牙。貝爾納斯躺在椅中，以好奇之態度注視英蘇代表之舌戰。</p>
<p>英擺動獅子尾　結果獲得勝利</p>
<p>惟是當全場表決各小國「反叛性」的修正案時，三大國忽又團結一致，協力擊敗紐西蘭之修正案。蘇聯對於重要之一點，因而獲得滿意，良以該修正案主張過半多數制，而蘇聯之整日開火，目的在支持三分之二多數規則故也。但真正之試驗，乃在英國修正案提付表決之時，該案規定過半數制及三分之二多數制兼容並納，蘇代表團力圖擊敗此一修正案，惟該案之一部份亦與蘇方意見相符。英國獅子之尾，於是急連擺動，英代表斷然拒絕任何妥協，英國卒獲勝利，一如蘇聯在表決紐西蘭修正安時獲得勝利然。現可充分預料規程委員會今後可一帆風順，於八日午後結束工作。届時和會即可轉變方向而開始考慮四强外長會議所提出之各項和平草約矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日廣播：蘇聯集團與西方列强間，業己發生嚴重之制裂痕，足以威脅廿一國和平會議之成功。大會代表鑒於規程委員會中由爭議而產生之敵意，深覺焦慮，預料大會在討論和約草案時，將引起激烈之辯駁，巧詐之手腕，與延宕政策。因一週以來連續不斷之辯論，各代表均感聲嘶力竭，致規程委員會今晨並未照常開會，而僅於下午舉行會議。觀察家對於法國之忠於西方列强及中國之公然擁護西方集團，認為殊　重視。　　託夫與維辛斯基於昨日長時間之辯論中，共發言十三次之多，雖唇槍舌劍，巧施手腕，但在每次具有決定性之表決時，均慘遭失敗</p>

<p>「路透社巴黎六日電」巴黎和會規程委員會今晨開會，空氣緊張，歷西小時之久，美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫發生劇烈爭辯。當規程委會恢復辯論三分之二票數，或單以最多數票表決議案一事時，</p>
<p>貝爾納斯　即抨擊莫洛托夫，斥其誤解美國代表團之態度。貝爾納斯並時時手指蘇聯代表團，而反駁莫洛托夫昨日所稱美拒絕蘇聯所提在巴黎和會期內應召開四國外長會議一項建議之言。略謂：莫洛托夫主張召開四國外長會議之目的，乃欲操縱主持各委員會之會議，其意即欲由四國外長會議考慮各項建議，但渠亦自知乃與事實不相符合，此即誤解美國之立場，余望各與會會員國能知此事實。蘇代表不獲其意時，每對與會同僚之動機，肆意　難，但此種策略，並不對其有所幫助，甚至最能忍耐之人，亦終必表示憤怒，且美國注視蘇聯之決意，常欲限制有少數國家締結和平大業，而美代表團則常主張由廿一國廣泛參加，如去秋倫敦四國外長會議及兩次巴黎會議時，美國皆曾為法國與中國參加各項討論之權利而作辯護，當美代表團動議程序規則之修正案，美代表團加以擁護之時，莫洛托夫又屬言行不符。如上週蘇代表則曾建議修改所己擬定之和約草案，以便波蘭可參加討論匈牙利問題之委會會議。又如決定邀請各國參加和會之時，當時對於程序問題並無一言，而莫洛托夫於次日堅持需附發程序條例之草案，始可發出請柬，余對此則己一再表示，倘四國外長會議向和會提出程序草案，美國當保留擁護與會各國所提合理建議之權利，但此項程序條例不得束縛和會，應由和會自訂其程序條例。此項申明己載於四國外長會議之議事錄中，見文亦曾發表多次同樣意義之談話，莫洛托夫歷次參加各項會議，當己耳聞此項申明，想渠當能同意其昨所發表之談話，自將引起吾之詫異。徵此而論，莫洛托夫所能言者，必僅為當同意擁護四國外長會議所提出之程序條例，美國代表決信守所言。余適所述及之紀錄，可由諸位及與論判明其是非。吾人在美國有言論自由之報章，故蘇代表可知其所作非難美代表團動機之言，必將見諸報端。余信任蘇聯人民，余要求莫洛托夫將余今晨所發表之談話，刋　蘇聯報端。當美國允予援助之時，蘇聯人民並不懷疑美國，吾人亦竭盡所能，予以援助。吾人敬仰蘇聯人民，今雖抨擊莫洛托夫，但並不滅弱吾人敬仰蘇聯人民之心云。當貝爾納斯演說之時，</p>
<p>莫洛托夫　屢側其首，傾聽其通譯之譯語。渠繼即起立致答詞，會場空氣騷動。莫洛托夫發言時，仍不減其平靜之語調，惟時時揮舞其臂，略謂：蘇聯代表團曾建議召開四國外長會議，討論某某數項問題，包括主席委員會在內，此屬事實，但此舉有何可以指責之慮？豈非尚有妨礙吾人工作進行之事件在乎？蘇代表團曾欲開會之前先訂程序，亦屬事實，且準確言之程序業己擬成，吾人討論此程序問題，歷時一週，但在開此和會之前，吾人尚未論及主要問題，倘不先行預定程序，則將再費時一週，——第三週——始可獲得決議，此亦屬事實，余認為預定程序乃一極正當之過程，但此程序條例草案，絕非操縱和會之謂僅供其參考而己。吾人所主張在和會期內，四國外長時時集議一點，乃欲便利四國外長會議討論和會所研究之各項問題，並可交換意見，當開始辯論此事之初，四國即有數國撤回其保留權，但事實上此項程序草案己由四國外長會議一致採納，今有數國在和會中似己走入歧途，惟蘇聯與法國仍遵四國外長會議之成議行事，英美代表團則在談論其保留權，此舉亦不能視為言行一致。吾人不必在此爭執是非，惟請諸君就事實加以判斷之。蘇聯所提之修正案己得四國外長同意，吾人之意乃欲防止可能發生之反對，倘有反對此項修正案者，則吾人可再加討論，但此項修正案之目的并不欲推翻四國外長會議之聯合決議，亦不容廢棄此決議，貝爾納斯之意，須申明程序條例不能束縛小國，吾人認為不必多此一言，蓋此為四國所己同意，亦為參加和會各國所擁護，貝爾納斯作此建議，吾人予以擁護，問題則己解決。關於尚未協議之問題，吾人可自由加以判斷，自由發表意見，蘇聯代表團當留意聽取各國之意見，加以週密之考慮，并當注意有益於和會及和平之任何建議。貝爾納斯因余昨日所發表之演說業經美國報章刊登，故要求蘇聯報章刊登其演說，此議吾人可予接受，其演詞全文當由蘇聯報章刊登，供蘇聯人民閱讀。所謂言論自由，則有人曾聞美國報業有控制美國大部份報章之組織，如英國檢察長蕭克洛斯近曾抨擊英國某部份報章，而主張英國報章應在首面刊登「本報係何人所辦」，「紀載與事實相符與否，不作保證」等語，吾人與有同感。對其不獲閱讀公正言論之報章一事，亦表同情，蘇代表團現希望能保證蘇聯報章持論公正，以孚眾望」云。莫洛托夫說誠時，全場皆注意傾聽莫洛托夫譏刺之言。蘇聯代表團曾偶發笑聲，貝爾納斯亦諦聽其譏刺之言。主席史巴克　宣佈關於三分之二票數一事之各項修正案，今日下午四時再行討論，遂即散會。</p>

<p>〔合眾社東京七日電〕據麥帥總部今日宣稱：傀儡皇帝溥儀將於審判戰犯時出庭作證，此係國際辯護團向蘇聯所提出者，但日期並未透露。蘇聯己同意將溥儀及前關東軍和田中將等四人（姓名未宣佈）引渡至日出庭作證。浦儀現由蘇聯看管於海參崴，在日期間將居留於蘇聯大使館中，「繼續由蘇聯加以看管」。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京七日電〕國際法庭今晨開庭後，首由日籍林辯護人反問前宛平縣長王冷齋，（問）根據松室秦德純協定，日方於七月卄六日要求中國軍隊移動，中國軍隊非拒絕此項要求乎？（答）中國方面雖希望和平，但日方不覆行協定，終因七月廿六日之最後通牒希望全失，不得己實行全面反抗，由廿九軍長下令奪回豐台·（問）綜合證人所言，該事件本能以外交交涉解決，而將該事件拖入大戰爭者，非中國方面之責任乎？（答）責任完全在日本方面。王氏證述畢，因中國證人張廷芳上尉急需返國，提前出庭作證，渠稱：「本人任職陸軍軍醫部，南京為日軍佔領後，仍留居該處看護中國傷兵。我等因知紅十字徽章毫無效用，乃着民服入難民收容所。六日，我等被押赴下關隊列長達四分之三哩，人數在五千人以上。及抵下關，見該處有日軍官約八百人，機槍掃射達四小時，余即躍入河中　逃，但肩部自背後為槍擊中，余乃給稱苦力得免。繼張上尉之後，前退役陸軍大將多田駿着和服登證人台，其口供錄稱：一九三七年八月至一九三八年十二月間，任參謀次長。一九三七年十一月十二日占領上海，十二月十三日占領南京，一九三八年十月廿七日計劃日軍攻略漢口之作戰計劃。占領上海之計劃係上海發生事變時所樹立，淞滬戰役進行時，樹立占領南京之計劃，占領漢口之計劃係一九三八年六月或七月間樹立。八一三之戰，係海軍方面來援於陸軍，乃急行計劃，一切均無準備，不得不以軍艦運送兵力。當時計劃，並無暫時或永久性質，只以占領南京後可望和平為目的而計劃。繼多田之後，上海美孚火油公司經理德蘭出庭作證，陳述日軍占領漢口時之暴行。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據不報記者獲悉，有韓人孫田昌植，（勝利後改名孫昌植）於抗戰　內，在本市　　敵僞勢力，設立大規模兵工廠，替日軍製造銳利軍火、勝利後、經人向三方面軍密吿，其工廠物資，曾被査封、後敵偽產業處理局成立，該案由三方面軍移交處理局。三十四年底　忽將査封之物資發還。密吿人對此處理不服，近又向接收淸査團中訴，昨日淸査團特傳申訴人來該　　間，對該案十分注意，全　詳情，輕採　如下；韓人孫田昌植，　居本市有年、向在南京路哈同大樓設立一小規模之工　社，經濟並不富裕，專以修理打字機，照担機爲生。因其妻（日人）之關係，結識日海軍省上海第一海軍經理部都長　谷大佐，遂被指派承製及修理各種軍火、並得澀谷之助，得向敵漢口銀行貸得鉅款。孫得款後·大車擴充榮務，遷廠至北四川路八〇七號、名稱爲「上海精密機械工藝社」。當時敵寇向我淪陷區收購各種硬幣（銀幣，銅幣，鋁幣，鎳幣等）及各種軍用五金原料，皆由孫承辦。又曾於民國三十年間，接受敵陸軍部之邀，乘機飛京，承包修理金陵兵工廠（首都最大兵工廠淪陷後被敵刦持）內全部機　·民國三十一年九月間，日軍部以奪自英商謀得利琴行之培開爾路九二七號總廠，交孫使用，並訂立契約，以軍管理名義經營，而專門修理及製造軍械，供給軍部。孫遂將北四川路八〇七號社址改爲產品陳列所，謀得利琴行總廠改稱爲「大日本軍管理謀得利洋行上海精密機械工藝社，」專門製洗軍用器械，如飛機零件，機關槍零件，衝鋒噴火機，刺刀，槍彈，銅幫浦等，並修理小型戰車，坦克車，迫繫砲等銳利武器。孫與日軍部隊交往最密者，爲登第一六二七部隊，該部隊所有軍火及任何工程，皆委託孫製造承辦，民國卅一年間，孫爲獻媚日寇，曾呈獻戰鬥機五架，當時日首相東條英機特頒予感謝狀。該社業務由於日酋之支持，範圍甚廣，僱用華工二百餘名，及日本·朝鮮·猶太·白俄等技工數十名。抗戰後期，爲應付盟機轟炸，該社屋頂架設高射砲保護，附近居民皆曾目睹。勝利後，孫即將該廠閉歇，將大批軍用物資移匿於西摩路一三五〇號。經人密吿於第三方面軍第二處，毛處長曾派員前往視察，卅四年十月二十三日，又派員前往，抄獲軍用五金及製成品達數千噸之多，並在南京路六十號謀得利事務所査獲重要賬册。又在貝當路孫之庽所查獲大批　鋁銅等溶塊，又在秘密地下室發現汽油十六桶，及汽車零件百餘箱，金條四十五根（四百五十兩），當經三方面軍查封後，移交敵偽產業處理局。於三十四年十二月下旬，敵偽產業處理局認為證據不足，故將說查封物資發還孫昌植。原密告人不服，故向清查團申訴，請求清查眞相，使有戰犯嫌疑之敵軍火商，無法遁形。</p>

<p>大會開始序樂後，就唱「父親頌」，——「勞苦勞苦父親苦，我愛我父肺與腑·羊跪乳，鳥反哺，愛我母，愛我父；爲我拿起鎚與斧，爲我拿起弓與弩；荆棘山林耕與耡，綠野千里田與圃。蒼蒼古樹根與土，世世勞苦父與祖，點點汗，粒粒榖，父與祖，子與父；風風雨雨愁與苦，子子孫孫歌與舞；勞苦勞苦父親苦，我愛我父肺與腑。」　歌由費　作詞，黃貽鈞譜曲，誠　廻旋，發人省思。</p>
<p>父親節前夕錢士湧接受其子獻花　（本報顧廷鵬攝）</p>
<p>父親的意義</p>
<p>主席陸幹臣報吿父親節發起經過後，就由顏惠慶致詞·他從父親兩字的意義旁徵博引的說到「天父」「國父」，應該受到最祟高的尊愛·他談起他在美國讀書的時候，學校裏的先生對學生非常關切，像家人一樣無微不至，中國的學生沒有這稱好福氣，祇有希望做父親的能担負起責任來，每一個父親每天應該抽出一部份時間來敎導他們的兒女；但是現在大多數做父親的都忙碌於酒色財氣。「所以」他說：「父親節的意義是雙重的。一方面做子女的要懂得愛他們的父親，一方面做父親的也要懂得修身齊家，把目光放遠一點敎導他們的子女，這對於國家對於種族都有極大的益處。」</p>
<p>涵養與啓發</p>
<p>皮禹繼起致詞，他講的是父親節的涵義與啓發。他說：「父親節在去年尙未勝利時敵僞壓迫下由幾位忠貞不貳的人士發起，以佩帶梅花形的國花來暗示對於祖國的懐念，把忠與孝連在一起，並且舉辦救濟淸寒學生的捐款等等。這一切都是民族意識的發揮，民族正氣的表現，和民族道德的發揚。而父親節對於我們的啓發有三點：一是由於這次抗戰，使我們認識淸楚祇要民族意識存在，國家前途是絕對有希望的。其次是使我們瞭解自已在家庭社會中的地位以及承上啓下的責任。是後父親節的紀念可以作爲我們一身的指針，由於想到父親對我們的關切而隨時自覺自節。」</p>
<p>演講過後，靑年會的「國語禮拜聖樂團」表演音樂節目，一曲女高音獨唱「叫我如何不想他」，和一首男高音獨唱”Who　isSylvia＂都博得淸脆的掌聲。</p>
<p>一位好父親</p>
<p>天父頌的　亠讀過後，慶祝會主辦人韓文藻起來介紹一位「好父親」錢士湧。錢氏令年五十八歲，有五子二女，他是滬北浸信會堂的董事，開設一家湧利水管工程材料行，對於公益非常熱心。靑年會發起的茶水推廣會，錢先生捐了不少茶缸茶具，而他對於兒女的敎導尤爲盡力。他的兩位公子錢元富和錢元貴也被請到台上來，元貴拿了鮮花，元富向聽衆報吿他父親的德行，他們在掌聲中把鮮花獻給他們的父親，也代表了千千萬萬做子女的對於父親的敬意。</p>
<p>慶祝會在「國語禮拜聖樂團」的另一個節目男女合唱”Duetfrom　Season＂的餘音中結束。主席陸幹臣最後報吿：父親節推行委員會與上海學生救濟委員會　，明天（即今日）將在本市　個熱鬧的地方養　紀念花，所得款項完全用來濟助淸寒學生。</p>
<p>規定紀念式</p>
<p>（一）父親是在，子女左襟上各佩就梅花，向父親敬禮，獻　父親平　喜愛的紀念品，並致感恩詞。（三）父親遠游，子女左襟上各佩紅梅花，發家書遵祝並獻呈父親平索喜愛的紀念品。（三）父親逝世，子女左襟上各佩白梅花，向遺像敬禮獻花默念致哀。（四）數代同居，各代子女以各該代父親健在與否，分別在左襟上佩帶紅梅花或白梅花，並分別獻　紀念品敬致感恩詞，依輩次向遺像敬禮，獻花，默念誌哀。（五）父親節不採用公共開　式，由全國各地每一家庭個別舉行紀念。（六）父　節最有　　的紀念，　捐助「助學金」救濟失學青年。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕潘仰堯現年五十四歲，嘉定人，勝利後軍統局上海辦事處因其有漢奸嫌疑·加以逮捕，解送高等法院檢察處偵査，提起公訴。該案昨日下午在高院由曹駿推事升座審訊、潘衣白紡綢長衫，灰襪黑布鞋，手執紙扇，平頭，髮已班白。由法官問明姓各年歲籍貫後，即供稱：戰前一向在四行　蓄會任秘書之職，戰時去過內地幾次，考察實業，後因此爲「七十六號」所忌，在四行儲蓄會門前被放一槍，幸而未中。後又被敵憲兵隊捉去過兩次，後即亡命香港。在港時遇周祥耕欲在滬組繼永豐銀行，邀我投資加入，該行曾向重慶實業部註册，並領得財政部之執照，我因覺其正當，遂亦投資三四千元，並被推爲董事，當時全部資余約五十萬元，至勝利時已增至僞幣三千萬元。地址在寗波路六十八號，今已奉財政部令宣吿淸理，董事長原爲趙鎭山，後因病亡故，乃准我暫代。該行全由工商界人士組織，與敵僞一無往來，全部股東共一千餘人，董監會中無一僞官在內·當時因係公開招股，而我又在香港，故王永康項康元等加入，事前不知·該行純粹爲商業銀行，舉辦小額工商貸款，並未有囤積居奇擾亂金融等事。至言所發表之文章，「如何增加生產」，係因敵僞將國貨工廠摧殘殆盡，民生困苦，故大聲疾呼·「自主自尊的生存要求」，即害中華民族與其他民族一樣應自主自尊，獨立平等，其眞意即爲使日人知道中國人不是隨便可欺，當時我大胆冒險，實因一顆熱心，無法抑制，才寫此文章，至今郤爲檢察官斷章取義，竟因此而吃官司，被吿無論如何是不承認有罪云云。並由姜屏藩俞恩良兩律師辯護。曹推事繼問潘是否黨員答稱不是。又問參加其他別的黨嗎，答稱沒有·曹推事即言這一點沒有關係，你說好了·潘仍答稱：被吿爲一書生，祇做做生意，不担任什麼政治上的職務·庭上乃諭押候改期再訊，潘即要求稱：被吿拘押至今，已近半年，連日在獄中臥病發燒·今日係勉强出庭，能否申請保釋，停止羈押。庭論按照法律程序，應遞狀申請，聽候裁定。潘遂仍由法警押回獄中。</p>

<p>茶會上，首由王先靑報吿選舉「上海小姐之意義」聲明並非閒情逸致之舉，其動機唯在本人類互助精神救助災黎等語。繼由吳局長致詞，略謂：此次籌募目標爲二十億元，除實業界金融界已分別認定十五億元外，餘額之募集頗費心力，爰發動此項選舉，以冀動員全滬市民，羣策羣力，救助三百萬難胞，吳局長亦一再表示選舉之事，純爲救災，絕非閒情逸致，望各界熱烈擁護。嗣忽有電台業公會理事長陸錦榮起立，謂請越劇組袁雪芬發言，袁當塲即表示，願盡他種義務，唯不擬參加競選語·陸再起立代袁補充稱越劇組不願參加，原因在於「人言可畏」，嗣後尚望新聞界多多「筆下超生」云云，王先靑氏當即聲明袁之意見僅係代表其個人，吳局長亦以陸某語近失態，當起立再度發言，對新聞界之熱心協助表深切感謝，並稱「人言可畏」一語，應改爲人言可愛。如此可以更熱誠親切，而募款救災之目標，方能容易達成也。會後據悉：名媛組參加者今又增章雪楓小姐一人，章係紹興人，十九歲，曉明女中高材生，故連前第一位報名參加之高淸漪小姐，已有二位·並聞尙有六位，正辦理登記手續中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿七日上午十時閘北西光復路一號祟信紗廠發生之二千萬元鉅刦案，當時匪徒十餘名各携快慢機槍且均富有巷戰經騐，故雖由該廠請願警及志仁邨分駐所巡官徐森甫等開槍射擊，然匪方亦不甘示弱，還槍拒捕，雙方相持達廿五分鐘之久，卒被匪徒在且戰且走下，携款逃逸，沿途並兩次刦奪路過卡車，各情已誌廿八日本報。茲據果，所有重要主犯及從犯已有九名先後落網，除六名在本市逮掩外，餘係追踪至蘇州及嘉興等地捕獲。茲誌破案經過如次：</p>
<p>偵騎四出遠及蘇嘉</p>
<p>査是日匪徒在第一次刦車後，因車行過速，行至中山路時，有一匪徒自車上拌下，致頭部重傷，即經餘匪另刦一十輸大卡車勒令司機下車後，將該匪扶上車中，繼續前進，惟在此匆忙時間中，匪徒遺落一公事皮包，旋即爲普陀路分局檢獲，內中抄出蘇州防疫證明書一紙，姓名爲李再揚，遂即根據此項綫索，着手偵査，得知李再揚現任閔行江蘇水警總隊第四大隊分隊長，於七月十一日向總隊長蘇晋請假一星期，採購分隊軍糖及軍服，經批准爲四天，惟到期李即音訊杳然，警同遂即依據調査報吿，另派幹員分赴松江及蘇州偵査（因李一度曾在松江充任大在隊長），旋在蘇州縣前街同德里十五號寓所拘獲其姊李素英，據供李並未來蘇，經在其家搜査結果，在一木箱底下發現信封一紙，上寫嘉興柴草塲四十八號江靜波收，是時警員已得知李妻名江靜波，而檢騐舉跡，尙屬新鮮，故確定江已逃匿嘉興無疑·</p>
<p>小村莊中船娘就擒</p>
<p>當時遂將李素英先行押解來滬，一面繼續赴嘉興柴草塲四十六號偵査，該處係一貧民窟，住戶衆多，雖經探詢，均不知江靜波其人，後經警員吿知面貌以及特徵等等始知即爲二年前在南湖紅極一時之船娘，最近由滬返此，現住離此約三里之小村內，警員當按址前往，果見江與另一男子綽號小東洋之楊鳳祥方同坐說笑，見警員突至，束手就擒，惟堅不吐露其夫行踪，僅供認其夫在刦款中，確曾與夏坤，小東洋，分得贓款六百十萬元。</p>
<p>上海方面續獲六名</p>
<p>其時上海方面亦於廿九日起接獲眼綫報吿，先於獲是案要犯趙小老漢，廿七歲，江北人，該匪槍法精明，此次分得贓款一百廿五萬元後，爲避人耳目仍在西康路隆慶里二七〇號　設大餅攤，根據其口供，復　獲從犯李萬根（又名小　子）及　　傳兩名，並在卞住處（其美路張家宅一六〇號）抄出快機二枝，轉輪一支，子彈卅發，經　訊後供　是案，係其弟金龍及夏坤李再　等所發動，惟其弟因是日　車受傷，現已離滬赴蘇治療云云·同時普陀路分局亦於是時拘獲從犯　麒麟（又名其林）一名，得悉主犯下金龍尚未離滬，逐即會同長甯路分局派員四出偵查，於卅日在橫浜嘉興路橋附近將下逮捕，時卞已僱就小舟一隻，擬自橫浜經浦江西蘇州河逃往蘇州治療，船資計五萬元　，惟當逮捕時，卞傷勢甚重，故警局即送警察醫院醫治，一而嚴詢口供，復在康家橋六十三號將另一主犯夏坤拘獲，至此全案人犯，除李再揚在逃外，幾已全部落網。聞此次匪徒事前佈置均由自稱「參謀」之夏坤策劃，而卞金龍「因公」受傷，故贜款中特提二百十萬元作爲治傷費云。</p>

<p>李熙謀致詞</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，李副局長致詞，略謂：在民國二十六年夏上海四大學，與市敎育局合辦中學敎師著期講習會，各中學敎師參加人數，非常踴躍。又謂：歐美各大學，每年暑期學校中，都設有中學敎師進修班。天氣實在太熱，李副局長搖搖紙扇，接着說：我們這個講習會，也是爲促進各位進修，提高中學敎育的效能而舉辦的。這次承交通大學的帮忙，將圖書館，物理實騐室，化學實騐室等全部設備，供給我們參考和實習。各科講師，都是全國全世界知名的大學敎授，我們應表示滿意與感謝。最後李副局長希望此次兩星期的講習，各位以所得的新的知識，用實騐的精神，共謀本市中學敎育的改進。</p>
<p>陳選善致詞</p>
<p>繼由陳處長選善致詞，略謂：上海在勝利後，對於新出版的圖書雜誌，如外國原本雜誌，內地出版物等，一到上海，便銷售一空，這是上海人知識　荒的現象，也就是上海人知識落後。這次我們舉辦中學敎師講習會，是想彌補這個缺陷的。陳處長又謂：在十年前，國聯敎育考察團的報吿裏，有句話說，我國敎育，頗受美國敎育的影響，就是說，僅注意教學方法的討論，而忽略敎材內容的研究，其實敎學法，也很要緊，我國中學各科敎學方法，很少有人在實驗研究。本會頗注意這一點，聘請講師，大量斟酌，務使敎材研究，與敎法討論，雙方並重。</p>
<p>王達剛致詞</p>
<p>最後王專員達剛，報告教務，及籌備經過，並謂：曾接蘇州無錫等地中學敎師來函，要求加入聽講，因本會未備膳宿，無法招待，只好謝絕。王專員又謂：，本會地點　交通極爲　利，五路公共汽車停在交大門口，一路電車下站，不數步即達，加之交大樹木滿園，淺草平舖，凉風吹來，不知溽暑，我們一面避暑，一面進修，不啻身入神仙世界，希望各位將此意轉吿同仁，踴躍參加，本會十分歡迎。又訊：該會今日正式講習，講師蔣竹莊，華羅庚，錢鍾靑等，均於第一日蒞會講授。</p>

<p>（三十一）問：凡權利行使，與義務履行，應依本籍或寄籍爲準？</p>
<p>答：寄籍之規定，所以濟本籍之窮，倘已在寄籍地居住，應即在審籍地行使權利，履行義務，但權利義務所由賦予之法令，另有規定者，則從其規定。</p>
<p>（三十二）問：判處無期從刑者，是否編入戶籍？</p>
<p>答：仍應編入戶籍，並在備考欄內詳予註明。</p>
<p>（三十三）問：逃荒之戶，係短期離家性質，調査時應如何辦理？</p>
<p>答：調査時遇此項情形，其戶號應予保留，暫不列入戶籍册。</p>
<p>（三十四）問：福音堂內住有外國教友數戶，又有公務員數戶時，應如何編戶？</p>
<p>答：按外僑戶普通戶分別編填</p>
<p>（三十五）問：戶籍登記簿，係以戶籍管轄區域爲單位，其編號係按照先後順次編列，如是則保甲之次序殊不整齊，檢查統計亦多不便，應如何補救？</p>
<p>答：可加一活頁戶籍冊，其內容項目及編號與戶籍登記簿相同，經初次戶籍篇登記後，如有設籍轉籍除籍時，除於有關簿册作變更登記處，可於此活頁戶籍册，隨時按保甲次序加入或抽出，其編訂方法，並依照保甲次序裝訂，以便檢査登記，而利統計。</p>
<p>（三六）問：關於本寄籍及暫居戶口之登記，如有外省或外縣來此縣市區域內，居住已歷數代，或數十年，或居住未滿三年，而男無本籍者，應如何辦理？</p>
<p>答：應令誤請爲本籍登記，若不願爲本籍登記，而願作寄籍登記者，可暫照准，但俟其原籍之省縣市辦理戶籍登記，六個月後，該戶應　出設有本籍登記，以减少無本籍之寄籍戶口，而符合戶籍法第四條一項之規定。</p>
<p>（三七）問：某人有一　二妾分居三　，三地同時辦理戶籍登記時，其家長應如何　填？辦理統計時如何始免重複？</p>

<p>（三八）問：保與保間之遷徙距離甚遠者，戶籍登記簿之次序，可否隨之而變更？</p>
<p>答：爲顧及保甲戶之次序，與戶籍登記海之次序起見，可暫就遷徙後之次序排列之。</p>
<p>（三九）問：戶籍登記簿，規定每本一百頁，逐頁編號，倘一次登記以後，發生設籍事項，應如何加入？</p>
<p>答：戶籍及人事登記，今旣以縣之鄕鎭及市之區爲其管轄區域，並應按保編號，就各保內之轄戶數目，自第一號起，順序編塡於每戶用紙之首號數欄內「第號」二字之空白中。新增之戶，聲請設籍時，仍應啣接編塡，其作用在記明戶數，每保爲起訖。至修正戶籍法施行細則第六條規定，由縣市政府或設治局所編之號，係指頁數而言，應塡於登記簿尾「第頁」二字之空白中，其作用在記明頁次，每簿各爲起訖。　戶號與頁號逈不相同，一在用紙之首，一在用紙之尾，一由鄉鎮區按保編填，一由縣市局按簿編填，明瞭此點，設籍事項目易辦理矣。</p>

<h3 id="c95">父親節　在教育上的意義 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>紀念父親節，在今天還是第二届呢！歷史雖然這麽短，意義却很深長；尤其在敎育上的價値，更屬偉大！</p>
<p>在每年的五月裏第二個星期日，我們很熱烈地紀念「母親節」·那是一個自幼失去母親的美國女子，在一九〇七年提倡的，現在已經成爲國際母親節了。但是我國自古以來，對於孝親，父母並重，古人說：「父兮生我，母兮鞠我。」現在有了一個母親節，怎好沒有一個紀念父親的日子呢？所以，在去年抗戰最緊張，勝利將降臨的時候，有顏惠慶等發起以八月八日定爲父親節，取其「八八」與「爸爸」諧音，便於記憶。今年舉行第二届父親節時，又有潘公展等請求中央明令規定，成爲國定的紀念日。同時有父親節推行委員會函請美英蘇法等國，共同提倡推行，不久將成爲國際父親節了。</p>
<p>孝親原是我國的一種固有道德，也是現代敎育上重要訓練之一，靑年守則中有「孝順」的規定，中心訓練亦有「孝親週」的實施。現在有了父親節的提倡，正可以加强這種訓練，達成敎育的目的。而且孝親的意義，並不限於奉親養體，順從親意；如果子女不能敦品勵學，努力上進，便辜負了父母撫養的苦心，不能算全盡了孝道。所以父親節的推行，直接的，間接的，在增加敎育效率。</p>
<p>做父親的，最重要的責任是敎育子女，使成爲一個健全獨立的人。古人說過：「養不敎，父之過。」這父親節的提倡，足以促使一般爲父親者重視自己的責任，免得兒童失學。國民敎育，將不普及而自普及了。最近，父親節推行委員會爲减輕父親負祖，救濟失學兒童起見，積極籌募助學金。希望這一個富有意義的運動，能够普遍地展開，獲得宏大的成果，也是本届父親節對於敎育上的一大貢獻。</p>

<h3 id="c96">工商請願團之課題　銀根暗緊……動力不足　生產低落……歇業相望 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會及全國工業協會上海分會因工商業危機日益嚴重，已推定代表，於今日夜車連衭晋京，向當局建議挽救方法，促其實施，上海商社特邀集各主要各業領袖，於今日下午四時，在市商會爲代表團送行，各方對此，頗表重視，據關係方面表示意見，邇來停廠關店，日益增多，不特工業瀕於沒落，商業亦難以支持，如綢緞業·棉布業·棉紗業等，旬日來每日有教家歇業，故此次請願，情非得已云，據熟悉金融市塲情形者談稱，去年抗戰勝利，政府復員，利率爲月息八分左右，其後逐步上漲，今年五六月份，竟達二角四五分之巨，終釀成六底之風潮，近又下跌，普通在一角二三分之問，而工商業之情景，則萎頓益甚，依共觀察，在五六月份高利貸活躍之時，實係工商業飲酖止渴，決非其營業利潤堪以勝此負担。</p>
<p>高利壓殺　不敢借債</p>
<p>及共利息堅殺，元氣傷盡，始悟借款之終非辦法，穩健者寗關門而不願再背債，客幫之在上海者，又以內地實銷稀少，將其滙申辦貨之款，先行拆放，因之生意愈淸，拆息愈無人敢吃，其局面危殆，不惜高利吃進客款以苟延殘喘者，則放款者又不敢下手，以故表面上利息降低，而工商業之資金，則愈見枯緊云，據紗布等業消息，各客幫所設之申莊，</p>
<p>實銷不振　申荘套息</p>
<p>近來確多以刮息子爲事，其手段先將款寄存廠號，情商貼息，廠號因貪圖其日後之生意，無不應命，及其接電辦貨，則又挨至船期，且再講貨款期頭五日或十日不等，以俟其所放拆息款子之能延長日期，其原因終屬生意寥落，廠號牽就之所致云，工業界權威方面透露消息，比來銀根明鬆暗緊，廠家生產率，</p>
<p>重要生產　率大低落</p>
<p>平均已降至十分之三四，其中如絲織業，針織業，手帕織造業，染織業，毛紡織業，繅絲工業，化學工業，機器工業等景况尤慘，捲烟業本稱黃金事業，近亦家家蝕本，電器及化粧品工業轉盈爲虧，更難立足，火柴，造紙，製藥等廠家，表面上雖在勉强維持，而成本日高，售價日削，終難爲繼，紗廠號稱天之驕子，但人人屬目，剝削在各業之上，業中人深恐好景不常，不無倦意，故就工業界全般觀察，銀根明鬆暗緊，於廠家祇有增加打擊，且國際貿易未有一定之方針，工人生活指數只聞報漲之訊，崩潰之境地，已經到臨矣，</p>
<p>電力不足　遷廠為難</p>
<p>査本市電力公司之發電設備，戰時損失渝三分之一，浦東及南市電氣公司至今未能發電，閘北水電公司最近雖經種種努力，可發電一部份，而以視戰前，不過五分之一，據上海電力公司之統計，各主要工業之用電，目下不及戰前百分之三十，全市工廠開工率之弱，可以槪見，有一部份廠家，戰時借租界爲避難之地，現擬就市郊廢墟，復建廠房，以爲將來發展之地步，而南市，閘北及浦東，現俱無法加添電流新綫，此於將來之工業復興，阻礙至大，據接近主管機關者談稱」。</p>
<p>修改稅則　不無牽制</p>
<p>十月間倫敦將有國際貿易會議，各國主張撤除關稅壁壘及其他貿易上之障礙，中樞雖有修改進出口稅則之議，而保護意義恐仍屬有限云，此問各工業公會對此，將有所表示云，請願代表團方面透露消息，此行將作扼要而應急之請求，工業危機，尤所注意，上開種種情形，均在籌劃應付之中云。</p>

<p>據棉業權威方面稱，本市民營紡織廠所存美棉已可應付至明年二月，此後所需美棉，聞最近曾向外商洋行定購，總數已達十萬包有奇，於明年一二月份即可裝船，届時若外匯聲請不准，擬以美鈔結匯，惟自中央銀行通吿各指定外匯銀行對國內交易及租金等不得以外幣支付及未經核准之棉花進口不得售與外匯後，民營舫織廠最近向外商洋行定購美棉十萬包之合同，　將發生問題。</p>
<p>該行此項措置，對國棉產銷，殊爲有利，予本市棉業帶助尤多，嗣後各廠商勢非採購國棉不可，國棉價格亦可提高，據農林部棉產改進處預計，明年國棉產量可達一千萬担，但照目前全國紡織廠需要而論，八百萬担已可應付。</p>
<p>美棉供不應求　新棉看到四角</p>
<p>査世界各國棉花產量，當以美國佔第一位，印度第二，中國第三，但蘇聯最近數年來產量亦頗可觀，惟數字迄未發表，據最近美國私家估計，本年新花收成可有九百四十四萬五千至九百七十六萬八千件。又據美國棉業交易所四十五家經紀人估計此項新花收成大致爲九百五十六萬四千件·因各國採購美棉頗湧，華盛頓出口銀行曾請政府將貸款增加至四萬萬美金，以備裝運澳洲及葡萄牙等各地。又西班牙最近亦成立二萬萬元銀關備購美棉之用，印度最近亦限制出口，美棉幾有供不應求之勢，價亦逐步上漲，聞新花價目，美農民有堅持每磅四角之說。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會局爲抑平糖價，使一般市民，均能購得平價食糖起見，曾商請臺糖公司於第七期起以台灣中砂，直接配售後，一般市民實際仍不能沾惠。然聞一般不決商號，更多以配到之平價食糖，大做後門交易，一轉手之間，坐收鉅利，殊可扼腕，茲第九期配售食糖，昨日起已開始接受申請，至明日截止。聞此次配售辦法，已有變更。即除南貨茶食兩業公會會員外，尙有糖商公會所屬各會員。以期較前更爲普遍。至配售價格，仍與第八期相同。</p>
<p>記者昨以一般市民，無法購得平價食糖之事，詢諸社會局吳局長，叩問該局對於此事，是否將採取有效措置。承吿：迄目前爲止，尙未接到有確擊事實之檢舉，故對此事，尙在密査中，惟據吿：自第九期配糖後，社會局爲加强監視各配得之南貨號門售情形起見，將商請各復員靑年軍合作。届時每店門口，均將派一靑年軍駐守監視，以杜流弊。同時，市民如發現各配得之南貨號有拒購情事時，均望列舉事實，儘量向社會局或臺糖公司檢舉，以憑査辦取締。</p>
<p>又本報記者爲明瞭台糖公司第七八兩期配售本市平價食糖經過情形，昨特趨訪該公司負責人，承吿：第七期曁第八期配糖經過情形如下：第七期配糖於七月二十六日，由社會局核准，二十七日由南貨業茶食業公會等至台糖公司交款，二十九日開始出貨，三十一日均已提淸，並於八月一日由台糖公司將各商號地址及購糖數量，分別公吿。總計配售一萬一千七百六十六包，配價每百市斤規定七萬四千元，整包發售似每百市斤八萬一千元，另售價每市斤八百六十元。第八期共配一萬五千三百七十八包，配價每百市斤規定七萬元，整包發售價每百市斤七萬七千元，另售價每市斤八百二十元，係於八月二日由社會局核准分配，三日交款，五日開始出貨，七日已如數出齊云。</p>

<h3 id="c110">出版與郵航 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>現在要出版一種刋物實在是不容易。普通的刋物除了流行的方型週報之外在經濟上是很難維持的，因爲刋物的維持要靠銷路，而現在的銷路大部分是地域限制的。例如上海出版的刋物現在祇能銷上海，最多是沿京滬和滬杭兩綫的地方。其他的地方由於交通的阻礙無法推銷。照一般有發行經騐的人們的估計，一種刋物假使在上海能銷一千份，它在全國便能銷四五千份。假使一種出版物光靠上海的銷路雖不能維持，但靠全國便可以維持了。這裏，我們可以看得很淸楚對於推銷刊物，傳播文化，郵航是負有重大使命。</p>
<p>最近有一位署名「苦悶的出版者」給出版界編者一封信，他說：「信不信由你，現在勝利已經快一年了，可是令人不解的，是上海郵政管理局對於航寄書刋限制的嚴格。根據郵局的規定，祇有普通信件日報和週刋，才能由上海用航空寄出。其餘的書籍和期刋，不論大小厚薄，不論重要性如何，不論寄到甚麼地方去，一概不能航寄。」雖然發行者格於郵局的規定不能將所發行的刋物用郵航向外埠寄，可是事實上在外埠的書局裏或報攤上却很快，就已經在出售這個刋物了。這又似乎證明航空郵寄並非絕對的不可能。</p>
<p>因此，本人爲愛護我國脆弱的出版界計特懇切的向郵政當局要求兩件事情。第一，請查一査看對於刋物的郵航有沒有「走私」的情形，假使有的話，請嚴厲的防止，「化私爲公」，公開的接受刋物的郵航。假使因爲航空的工具不够，不妨在數量上予以適當的限制。第二，假使沒有「走私」的淸形，郵政當局能否考慮對於各種出版物的郵航代爲設法放寬限度，因爲傳播文化的種子在郵政方面也是値得担負的一種工作。</p>

<p>作者　孫科</p>
<p>出版　商務印書館</p>
<p>日期　卅五年六月上海版</p>
<p>頁數　一七〇頁</p>
<p>關於中國出路問題的書，我們近來時常可以在坊間看到。我們覺得這是一個可喜的現象。戰後我們到底希望中國成功一個甚麽樣子？這是每一個中國人都應該問的。我們不能任憑這個國家在事實上自然的演變下去，我們還應該有理論上的研究。這種研究可以使大家對於國家的前途有一個明確的認識。孫哲生先生以一位實際的從政者對於中國的前途更作一種學理上的檢討，把他的經騐和理論融貫一氣，這實在是一件難能可貴的事。我們近來讀到了他的三本著作：（一）中國之前途；（二）中國與戰後世界；（三）三民主義新中國。這三本書都是由商務出版的。它們包括了哲生先生近幾年來對於中國出路問題的論文和講稿。「中國的前途」有二十二篇，附綠二篇，書末有吳經態先生的題跋於哲生先生的人生哲學多所關發。「中國與戰後世界」共爲十七篇，末附司徒德先生的跋。「三民主義新中國」也是十七篇，附錄有（一）國民政府建國大綱，（二）中華民國憲法草案（三）第一期經濟建設原則等三篇。</p>
<p>在孫光生的講述中我們找不到感情用事的宣傳和抽象空洞的口號。他是以一種學者的風度來研究問題。其間有爲主義而辯護的地方，但也有嚴肅的自我批判。例如他說：「現在我們檢討下來，覺得總理遺敎裏面許多地方，我們都沒有做到，因爲沒有做到，以致我們國家的困難天天增加，國家的建設也不易完成。」又說：「過去我們的黨和政府常常有很好的決黨案，但是頒發下去，剛到了中層，便已經推不動了。中下層都是不負責任，不能貫澈命令的執行。他的工作都是書面報告，事情做不通就停下來，或者根本不做便往旁邊一擱，到上面催促或期限已滿的時候，就來一個畫面報吿……中央靠省，省靠縣，一層一層下去，都沒有人考察糾正他們的錯誤。一切因錯就錯，結果便弄到政治毫無進步。「這許多都是針對時弊，一針見血的話。</p>
<p>哲生先生對於中國出路的看法可以用一句話來代表——「民主世界中的民主中國」。在三十三年的國慶日他說：「世界在朝着民主的方向走。儘管反民主的法西斯暴力尙未完全消滅，然而這種反動的力量今天已無法阻擋這個巨流了。」所以在他的看法，戰後的世界應該是一個民主的世界。不過「要建立國際民主，必須有兩個起碼的條件：一·必須容許每一個民族根據它自己人民的意志，決定他的政治形式。組織它自己的生活。二·必須在戰後的國際合作，容許一切大小國家一律平等。沒有這兩個前提，國際的民主是談不到的」。此地，他反對耶魯大學敎授斯派克曼的「新均勢主義」，因爲這種均勢主義的精義就是「一切以自已的利害得失來權衡」，需要制甲時，當然可以聯乙；需要制乙時也不妨回頭聯甲。這種辦法能保證戰後世界的和平麼？不能！因爲這是納粹德國地理政治學派理論的重唱。反之孫先生希望戰後中美英蘇各盟邦能够永久保持團結一致，無保留地應用大西洋憲章的精神來樹立遠東各國的和善關係。因此，戰後的世界必須建立在民族平等和人類普遍的幸福生活兩個基礎上。關於全人類的幸福又必須做到兩件事：第一，普遍的提高各國人民的生活水準；第二，重視生產和分配兩方面的合理化，以避免不均等的發展和民族間的掠奪。</p>
<p>關於如何處理日本以締造遠東和平一點，孫先生主張一定要（一）澈底摧毁日本的軍事機構；（二）解除日本的工業武裝。關於澈底摧毁日本的軍事機構，第一要根本消滅日本的黷武主義敎育，第二要消滅日本的軍事幹部。關於解除日本的工業武裝，第一要摧毁日本殘餘的軍事工業，重工業和機械工業，第二要限制日本的輕工業使日本沒有重整軍備的機會。在政治制度方面，他主張一定要取消天皇，推倒帝國，而必須建立一個眞正民主的日本民國。</p>
<p>在民主的世界中我們又怎樣來締造一個民主的中國呢？在答覆道個問題的時候孫先生又提出了三個問題：（一）怎樣的中國總算民主的呢？（二）在甚麽條件之下後能建立這個民主的中國？（三）要經過如何的程序繼可以實現這個民主的中國？</p>
<p>所謂民主的國家就是一個「民有民治民享」的現代國家。中山先生說過：「這個民有民治民事的意思，就是國家是人民所共有，政治是人民所共管，利益是人民所共享」。「國家是人民所共有」就是說，在這個國家裏而不管憫人間有甚麼種族上的分別，他們都是一律平等的，這個國家不屬於某一個人或某一部分人的，而是全民所共有的。他們之所以可能共有這個國家，這是因爲在文化的發展過程中各民族遂漸的同化與合流而有了共同的民族意識。在一個民主的國家中各個人之間一定要保持有這個共同的民族意識。這便是中山先生的民族主義。「政治是人民所共管」，這就是說人民有共同管理國家之權，再從這個民權中產生一個有效能的政府來執行他們的公意。這便是中山先生的民權主義。「利益爲人民所共享」，這裏面一方面是以工業化的方式來增進人民所能共享的利益，另一方面是用平均地權和節制資本的方法來使利益在人民間有公平的分配。道便是中山先生的民生主義。所以照哲生先生的意思，民主的中國就是三民主義的中國。不過這個三民主義大家不要把它當作是國民黨所獨有的主義，而是中華民國在文化，政治，經濟的建設上所應共有的最高原則。這一點在近幾年來共產黨，國　黨，靑年黨各方面都是同意的。</p>
<p>要建立這個民主中國，孫先生認為要有四個最低的條件：（一）人民基本自由的法律保障；（二）民間政治關體的合法存在；（三）軍隊武力的絕對國家化；（四）國家行政的完整無缺。</p>
<p>至於如何實現這個民主中國，孫先生主張：「提早結束訓政，召開國民大會，制頒憲法，改組政府，實施　政。使全國人民都能循着法治的軌道來負担國事的責任。」關於實施憲政中的許多重要問題均詳孫先生「三民主義新中國」一書，從略。</p>
<p>中國是世界一部分。戰後我們固然希望要有一個民主的中國，同時也希望要有一個民主的世界。全世界是一個完整的有機體。中國的實現民主有繫於國際的民主精神，而有了民主的中國方始能够建立一個完美的民主世界。所以孫先生說：「在民族文化建設的高潮當中，我們的任務是發揚民族文化，……同時亦是促進大同，改造世界主要因素。」</p>

<p>— 老舍著</p>
<p>惠羣出版社　三十五年八月出版　朱力</p>
<p>凡是讀過老舍的著作的，大槪都有一種感覺·在輕鬆的故事中有着沉滿的諷刺；假使不能體味到這點沉痛的諷刺而把他寫作笑話，那實在是不能了解作者的本意了。一般人把幽默和諷刺當作笑料，不僅是寃枉了作品的價値而且還誣蔑了作者的苦心。</p>
<p>創造一個典型，要在若干具體事象中攝取特性，而並不是在若干事象中任意取樣。老舍這本「我這一輩子」，是描寫一個巡警的一生，是描寫巡警的典型，不是描寫一個姓什麽名什麽的巡警。我們讀完「我這一輩子」。使我仍對　騷些所謂社會的渣滓發生了同情，但也使我們想到一個問題，爲什麼社會有這些渣滓？誰使他們成爲渣滓呢？</p>
<p>一個在幼年也讓過書，雖然　的不多，也足够看看「七俠五義」和「三國演義」什麽的，由於社會環境的限制，最初他只能去學些手藝來糊口，學的是裱糊匠，在當時倒也吃香，更因他懂得人情，肯頭從，順順經經地三年滿了師。滿了師，他便成了街面上的人，年輕·利落，懂得塲面，在他本行很吃得開。但是，厄運來了，年輕的妻子跟別人跑了。傷心，再加上別人的　　，他消沉了：喝酒，抽烟，改了行。改行，當巡警。那時的巡警和洋車，是大城裏頭給苦人們安好的兩條火車道，大字不識而什麼手藝也沒有的，只好去拉車，有手藝而掙不上飯的，只好去當巡警。那時的巡警，每月六塊錢，一身制服；挑巡警也用不着多大的人情。安分守己的巡警，不論冬夏，不論晴雨，在路上管管車馬行人，打架吵嘴，沒有什麼「外找兒」，一個月死賺六塊錢·但是，這六塊錢也不好賺的，一天到晚在街面上，能說會道，見機而作，大事化小，小事化無，不給官面上惹麻煩，又讓大家都過得去，眞眞假假，就算是本事。他在學手藝時學會的一副忍耐，利落的本領，使他安安穩穩地每月得到六塊錢，不久，變故來了，「大淸國」改爲「中華民國」了。他聽說：「一改民國，凡事就由人民主管了。」但是，他沒有看見事實，他由街面上的巡警升任給官兒看門的三等警了。他覺得時代變了，民國的確自由，在滿淸國的時候，凡事都有個準譜兒，穿藍布大掛的就得穿藍布大掛，有錢也不行，一到民國來，宅們里有了自由，只要有錢，愛穿什麽就穿什麽。不久，他有了好機會，在馮大人那裏當警衛，作了馮大人的跟班，有馬騎有黑呢制服穿。在馮大人那裏祇有短短三個月，因爲馮大人下台，他調到總局裏去當差，還得了一面銅片的獎章，彷彿是請他在宅門裏立了什麼功勞。當了十年差，他才升到頭等警，每月掙大洋九元。他挨到四十歲，大運亨通，補了巡長。當了兩年巡長，他的頭上見了白頭髮；沒有母親的兒子和女兒都長大了。兒子要作事，也當了差；女兒要給人，給了當差的。他自己要到外面活絡活絡，又到馮大人那里找機會，機會有了，命令下來是衛隊長，因爲馮火人倒運，他也沒有上任，回頭調防疫處當守衛。有了年紀，也娶了兒媳婦，他想應當留　子，於是留了鬍子。但是，新任的總局局長不能了解他，在檢閱的時候發現了這些老朽，開革了。閒了半年，才弄到個事，到河南去當　務緝私隊的　兵，後來升了排長。兒子生了孫子，但是兒子死了。他要照顧年輕的兒媳婦和小孫子，又不能在家鄕找到一份事，他只有去打雜，他去看守空房，他去幫人賣菜，他去作泥水小工，他去給人搬家……。五十多歲的老頭兒做出二十歲小伙子的力氣，肚子里只有點稀粥與窩窩頭。饑餓與過份的辛勞，還有五十年來的遭遇，使他領悟到：「我對得住一切的人，我心里沒毛病，還說什麼呢？我等着餓死，死後必定沒有棺材，兒媳婦和孫子也得跟着餓死，那只好就這樣吧！誰敎我是巡警呢！我的眼前常發黑，我彷彿已摸到死。哼！我還笑，笑我道一輩的聰明本事，笑這出奇不公平的世界，希望等我笑到末一聲，這世界就換個樣兒吧！」</p>
<p>老舍的描寫是非常輕鬆的，只讀故事的就認爲是一個故事，仔細辨味起來，就有一種沉重的感覺，社會安排給這一輩子的就只有這點狹窄的活路嗎？</p>
<p>老舍對於這問題沒有解答，他只提出問題，也提出希望，「希望等我笑到末一聲，這世界就換個樣兒吧！」</p>
<p>老舍採用的題材，依時間而論，是滿淸末年到民國現在；依地點而論，是樸實的北方古城；依人物而論，是天性純厚帶點奴性的善良的人們·全書用自述體裁，用自己的嘴吧來述說他的一生，所以名之爲，「我這一輩子」。</p>

<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>孩子：</p>
<p>歷史不是重演的，但是權利和義務，却必需循環地要你享受，要你負擔。我的父親曾經諄諄告誡過我，現在，是輪到我要告誡你了。我只曾想到工作，工作，可從沒有想到老，但是，回首前塵，不期而然地知道我的時代也已經遠去了。</p>
<p>我的心情，你一定很明白。但是你明白的，只是在你　方面的看法。</p>
<p>孩子和我是不可分的。我用血液培植，我用汗滴滋潤，我可不曾想到過要有收穫。孩子是我畢生最大的希望，最大的寄託，就是因為，孩子在我生命上的價值，是沒有方法可以估計的。</p>
<p>年累時候，我卜盡卜夜的工作，為的是我不想使你們失望，也不希望你們得不到你們應有的享受。天下有許多富的爸爸，也有許多窮的爸爸，他們的心却是一致的，都用全心靈在培植孩子，都用全生命奉獻孩子。為了你們，我不想說化了多少精神，因為這是必然的責任，但是我的的確確多受了許多次的白眼，為了你們，我懂得了容忍。</p>
<p>父親培植孩子。因為不僅孩子是他們的兒子，孩子就是希望，孩子就是將來。</p>
<p>你們孩子，只要望着自己的希望，自己的將來，邁步向前，你們勇敢地向前，就是怎樣地在鼓舞你們的父親。生活再苦，父親也不想在孩子身上取得報償，對於孩子，父親從不曾打着算盤，雖然，父親常會代孩子打着算盤。</p>
<p>我也曉得，你們幼小的時候，是怎樣的聽話。但是，你們長大了，就多少地把我的話作為累贅了。我很高興，你們有自己的決斷，自己的思想，自己的時代，但是我依然說，因為多少地可以提供我的經騐。我相信你們有偉大的開展，可不是，我決不希望我把孩子只塑成了一個像我一樣的人。你們，至少要比父親偉大一千倍，一萬倍。</p>
<p>我還能够工作，我還要工作。</p>
<p>我要管你們，我要把眼睛老放在你們身上，我的心靈跟着你們跳動；但是，我要你們不要管我，要忘記我，努力地勇敢地向前。</p>
<p>人生的經歷是苦的，飽歷滄桑，我不斤斤於你們物質上的供養。你們只要在精神上使我得到滿足和安慰，這就是你們對我最大的供養。</p>
<p>你們的生命要開花，你們的生命要結實。—我的血，我的汗，我的生命都滲透在你們的生命裏，我的生命也借着你們的生命，要長遠地燦爛！</p>

<h3 id="c115">李太太的煩惱 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 張沐么</p>
<p>李太太這兩天很是煩惱。就拿這點來證明：整整三天沒有去大光明了！</p>
<p>李先生這一週來總是神色慌張地到家轉一轉，那種坐不住立不穩的姿勢，活像一頭龍裏的狗熊。那張胖得發油的臉頓時瘦了一片；一對細眼也凹下去有半寸的深。她知道證券股票一落脈的跌，李先生搶的「帽子」，（買空賣空的意思）將要硬戴在自己頭上了。這一下，李先生頂愛吃的紅燒蹄子只好原封不動擱在橱裏；飯也不需要燒，娘姨可以到隔壁王太太家裏暫借幾頓就行。自己呢，喝點牛奶汽水儘够。</p>
<p>回想一年半前剛生下小玲的時候，住在武定路那間亭子間裏，那時候李先生還在偽什麽稅局當個辦事員，自己冒着風雨擠在福康米店門口伸出手像搶刧般領點配給米的情形。整日担了米呀柴呀的寒心；小玲也為了吸不出奶汁，糟蹋得活像一只瘦皮猴。好容易李先生把結上他的主任，借了點資本，介紹進證券交易所做點實進拋出的生意，托天之福，就此居然一帆風順，生活逐漸趨向日精月美了！唉，才一年半哪！眼看這一份辛苦掙來的家務—包括　　洋房一幢，　如的田基三百畝，三輪車一架，等等—　在風雨裏飄搖，叫我們李太太怎不着急呢！</p>
<p>剛才穿好一套鴻翔新製的夏裝。整天悶在家裏也不行；有了煩惱的人，家彷彿是煩惱的繁殖所了，倒不如到外面散散心。但到什麽地方去呢？李太太開始在腦穴中追尋清除煩惱的對象。趕大光明六點半一場正好，片子是什麽大西洋的戰事片，可是李太太一想到銀幕上千篇一律的那些男女就作嘔了。那末去新開的××夜花園坐坐聽聽音樂，啊，不行，一個人去枯坐還不如在家裏躺躺，况且一想到音樂兩字，頭裏就轟轟地像馬達般響起來了。那末還是到一〇四號去看看李先生吧，打聽一下今天的消息；那也不行哪：他是不是在呢？即使在，那張陰慘慘的臉就像貼在眼前了，她委實有些怕。這怎麼辦呢？一向使她醉心的大上海竟沒有她跑的地方了！那末，還不如到董太太那兒去抹四圈，可是一張張「筒」，「條」，「萬」，像長了刺，她的一雙十指尖尖的嫩掌還敢去摸！喔，提起董太太不禁使她聯想起昨晚的一段對話。董太太挾了一陣粉香連跑帶跳衝進屋來喊着：</p>
<p>「李太太·你兩天不來打牌了，為點啥呢？去，來四圈。」</p>
<p>「嗯，我啊，我一點心思也沒有！」</p>
<p>「看你愁眉苦臉的樣子，哈哈！又是李先生在外胡來了，是不是？」</p>
<p>「不……這倒不是！」</p>
<p>「嗨，你也不要瞞我了！管他的，他會玩你也玩呀，他今天化十萬八千的，你就化他個廿萬。哼，對付男人就這個方法。來，我們去……」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>門呀的一聲開了，娘姨抱着小玲進來。小玲嘴裏吚跑來跑唔呀的張開了兩只滾圓的臂膀要媽抱。小脚一下碰着李太太那件雪克司汀大衣，她趕緊退後一步，拿手拍拍豐滿可愛的小臉。小玲得不到預期的欲望，垂落了小臂膀，睜大圓都都的眼，瑟縮着小嘴，好像隨時準備放聲一哭的樣子。李太太忙着轉身，輕輕說：</p>
<p>「王媽，抱他出去玩。」</p>
<p>黃昏的影子像一只大翅膀柔和地蓋上窗洞。初夏的凉風打窗子裏跳進來，宛如一位不速之客想給主人一個驚怵。李太太下意識地順手合上窗門。不遠處飄蕩着收音機的尖聲音，　和了馬路上疾馳的汽車聲，給黃昏帶來一種空虛和匆遽的悲哀。李太太的心裏誠然想快樂起來，然而　然脫下大衣往床上一甩頹然倒到沙發上兀然沉思起來……</p>
<p>……一切都死寂了！一切都黑下來了！身子像坐吊桶似往上一步一步昇，昇，昇，猛地，　斷人從半空中驚　似落到地板上；李太太正欲摸摸心口，噓一口氣的時候，門呀的移開了一半，一個黑影擠了進來；逐漸地，逐漸地大了，高了！活像「夜半歌聲」裏那幕恐怖　頭。李太太　起臉，拼命想喊王媽，但嘴裏像有一塊濕綿堵着。身子彷彿被黑影越韱越緊，差點兒透不過氣來。倒下了！倒下了！李太太握緊拳想拒搥那個壓在她身上的黑影，於是勇敢地睜開眼，房裏一片雪亮，她看見一張蓬鬆着頭髪，赤紅了眼，蒼白的臉。……這臉多陌生啊！喂，又多熟悉啊！她下細地端詳了一息，啊呀，這不是為她每分每秒躭心着的李先生嗎！怎麼一夜不見變成這個樣子？她張開臂想撲過去，但李先生弛緩地搖搖頭，又弛緩地低垂下去，她驚慌了。望望房裏的擺設，啊呀！橱裏的西裝旗袍散滿一地，適才還好好的，這是怎麼回事？……忽然一縷悲哀的像弓弦上發出的鳴咽在她耳邊響着：</p>
<p>「素芳，完了！一切都完了！……你現在收拾收拾吧！……我們走，……小玲呢！」</p>
<p>「……」李太太木然站着，眼前亂舞着黑片，火星，耳際滾動着雪聲，崩裂聲，……牠，她無力地倒向前，哇的一聲哭出來，……</p>
<p>「太太，太太，醒醒！」王媽抱了小玲站在夢哭的李太太面前，張開了木訥的大嘴，望着這位憂鬰了幾天的主婦，好像要問：</p>
<p>「福氣的太太，你還有什麽不稱心如意的地方呢？」</p>
<p>李太太當發覺自己經過了這一場噩夢時，心所而辛酸地絞痛了。</p>
<p>「這是預兆！這是預兆……」她呢喃着反覆的字眼。</p>
<p>窗外完全黑盡了。身上濕膩膩地，眼睛也是模糊不清，她順手拉出手帕揩了揩。當她　視着小玲那一雙睜得滾圓的驚訝的小眼睛時，　地從五媽手裏奪過去，緊緊摟住，生怕別個來搶奪似的，嘴唇瘋狂地印遍了小玲的頰，　，嘴，及各部份。……</p>
<h3 id="c116">嘉陵江的憂鬰 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>嘉陵江散曲之一</p>
<p>嘉陵江的水綠了又黃。</p>
<p>當春風吹綠了嘉陵江水，夏天的雨，又給嘉陵江帶來了渾黃的顏色。生長在嘉陵江畔的孩子們，誰也會知道在什麽時候嘉陵江的水會綠，在什麽時候嘉陵江的水會變成渾濁的泥漿。他們可以很熟悉的指出，甚麽樣的船是煤船，甚麽樣的船是快艇，因為船隻的顏色和樣式，已深深地印入了他們的心裏。可是，他們却不會更深的知道，在那綠了又黃的嘉陵江水中，是埋藏着無限的眼淚和悒鬰。</p>
<p>在春水綠波的時候，嘉陵江上的船隻漸漸的多了，白色的帆影，悠揚的船伕曲，飄揚在嘉陵江上。這時，從河灣裏咿咿呀呀的划出來一隻小舟，一個青年漢子握着舵，用力地划着木槳。小船的中央放置了兩個小蘿筐，籮筐裏面是烤熟了的燒餅和一缽子拌着醬油辣椒的蘿葡絲，在一個小小的木架上，擺設着許多夾好蘿葡絲的燒餅，一個年青的婦人，憂鬰地坐在在架的旁邊。</p>
<p>他們把自己的小舟划近那從江上漂流下來的大木船，用力地拉着大木船的邊。</p>
<p>「先生，吃燒餅嘛，熟的，蘿葡絲燒餅！」年青的婦人苦笑地喊叫着。</p>
<p>大船上的乘客們都鄙屑地向她看了一眼，「太不衛生！」他們都低沉的說一句。</p>
<p>「先生，吃燒餅嘛，熟的，蘿葡絲夾的燒餅！」她的聲音漸漸的低了，失望的陰影，襲上了她的心頭。</p>
<p>「放開！你老是拉着幹啥子！」船伕們粗暴的咀罵着，她只得放開手，把小舟推離了大船，讓小舟後面的年青漢子，把小船往上流划去，划向另一隻從江上飄下來的木船的旁邊。</p>
<p>「媽的，臭貨！」船伕們還悄悄地補上這麽一句，雖然自己的船已經流下去了，江上的凉風也不會把這刻薄的咀罵帶回她的耳裏。</p>
<p>「先生，吃燒餅嘛，熟的，蘿葡絲夾的！」從江的上游，又飄揚着那陰沉的憂鬰的聲音……</p>
<p>夏天的日光，晒綠了樹木的葉，却晒黃了嘉陵江的水。江水在赤熱的陽光下奔騰着，怒吼着，用它渾黃的舌，舐蝕着江畔的岩石，在山脚下激起狂烈的浪花。</p>
<p>這時，從河灣裏，不再有咿咿呀呀的小舟划出，也不能再聽見那凄凉的叫賣聲。年青的漢子揩起那簡便的行李，悄悄地從江灣深處的茅屋中走出，走向那生活的道路。年青的婦人，倚着那將要倒塌的土墻，默默地望着那消逝在遠處的背影，晶瑩的淚珠，無聲地晒落着……。</p>
<p>嘉陵江水綠了又黃，嘉陵江的水聲永遠是那麼的憂鬰！</p>

<p>— 格魯茲作（一七二五—一八〇五）</p>
<p>陳列於倫敦國家畫廊</p>
<p>有許多藝術家及作家，對於自己的作品，往往缺乏正確的認識和評價；格羅茲（Jean　Baptiste　Greuze）就是一個極顯著的例子。他自命為歷史畫家，這種自我的誤解，使他陷於不幸。由於對風俗世態畫刻苦辛勤的研究，他被選為法國學術院的會員。因為他遲遲沒有交出自己的文憑畫，最後學術院竟不得不禁止他再展曁自己的作品，直到交出他的文憑畫。最後他繳出了自己的畫件，却是一幅極力想證實自己是歷史畫家的作品。結果大大地失敗，竟遭到學術院院長的斥責，這時格魯茲已接受了儀式上的榮譽。自此，他閉門多年，拒絕展覽自己的作品。</p>
<p>這一件事情，證明一個人倘對自己缺乏瞭解，足以影響他的成就。格魯茲的成就，是他的家庭生活景物畫，得到廣大人們的愛好。</p>
<p>由於他的勤勞，積資頗豐；但，他終於又揮霍盡了自己的錢財；到了晚年，意不能不請求自己體力不能勝任的工作。一八〇五年，他在極度貧困中，死於拉凡爾。「少女」表現蓋爾茲最愉快的作風，也是他的載譽作品。—成璐附誌。</p>
<h3 id="c118">譚刻竹 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 吳雙人</p>
<p>雕刻是藝術的一部門，在美術史上佔據很重要的地位。但治印刻竹，却是我國特有的藝術。筆者有竹石擗（石指圖書石）；因愛竹石，遂亦嗜刻。更因求人不如求己，操刀小試，愧未升堂，勉能入室。古今來紀載刻石的專書，自盛行印章之後，出版很多；日報月刋，亦有著述。惟紀載刻竹的著作，絕無僅有。祇有「竹人錄」，「竹人傳」等，薈集刻竹家，傳其概略，附以藝術的月旦，未嘗述及治竹方法。筆者不揣謭陋，一得之見，草此塵譚，聊為　引。</p>
<p>要刻竹，必須先搜集上好竹材！最適宜的材料莫過於水磨白竹；溫潤而古雅。晨夕撫摩，日久自熟，竹青（竹皮）漸轉蜜蠟黃，由黃變紅；如玩紅白漢玉，能慢慢地透明轉赤，逗人興趣。凡玩竹者切勿揩鼻頰浮油！揩了油固然容易紅熟；但與自然紅變者不同，前者帶烏黑，後者呈血紅，相去不可以道里計。欲使之自然的迅速紅變，亦有辦法；可懸置透風處，經空氣的流動飄拂，便能漸轉紅色。惟須將竹器，時時變換位置方向，俾四面同樣受風。否則向風紅而背風淺，全面顏色，永遠不能均稱了。若嫌「風吹法」太遲，可用「油漬法」，取上好菜油或花生油，熬熟，待冷，蘸敷竹面更易紅變。　每經一次漬油，呢須揩拭凈盡！否則容易發　，黃梅時節尤甚。刻竹宜待紅熟後奏刀，較新竹一團火氣者，顯分雅俗。不過用油漬法的竹材，因其透油入骨，竹筋（即竹內縷縷纖維）已　化，刻時容易「溜刀」，是其缺點。</p>
<p>選取水磨白竹材料，要注意的：（一）竹青勻潤；（二）竹筋要纖細而無深淺（三）切忌裂紋（最好預先多買竹料，經過一二年之後，檢視不見裂紋者，便合。若向店舖買來就用，每每遇到當年新貨，經霉入伏，立即開裂了）；（四）材料以粗大為貴；（五）不論竹青，竹黃（即竹肉），不可有搬痕黑點；（六）細察竹上有沒有小孔。如果有孔為內生蛀虫的徵象。趕快與　竹隔離；略一疏忽，必致傳染，全數被蛀了（凡竹器上發見細微竹　，必有蛀孔）。</p>
<p>文具中如筆筒，詩筩，擱臂，墨牀……等，大都取材於水磨白竹；因白竹多巨材，能隨意取舍之故。若扇骨，烟管，手杖，蕭，笛等，則取材較寬，例如湘妃，梅蘿，雞絲，桃絲及棕竹都可以。就中以扇骨材料，最為廣泛。若取方竹作扇骨，尤為珍貴；因其竹面平勻，不作弓背式，當其轉呈蜜蠟黃時，殆類血色象牙，令人可愛。亦有冒充方竹者，乃用巨材，縱截而選取之者。蓋巨竹粗徑，剖為狹條，不見彎形呢。</p>
<p>刻竹必請名家作書畫，方見珍貴；或臨摹金石文字，亦極古雅樸茂。但書畫宜直接作於竹面！如果以紙作粉本，貼紙於竹，然後奏刀，定多走樣。但竹而光滑，不易着墨，可用牙粉或化粧用粉，薄薄敷上一層，便可隨筆所施，圖轉如意了。此指去皮的竹黃而言。若在竹胥上寫繪，抹去油汚便得。</p>
<p>練習刻竹，先用劣竹刻畫挑剔，務至書平豎直程度，然後再練轉折鈎勒；自己覺得手腕並用，有十分把握，纔能正式刻竹了。</p>
<p>刻的方式不一：有陰文（猶印章的白文），有陽文（猶印章的朱文），有皮雕（亦稱留青，蓋留下竹青，為陽文書畫也）。最為顯明動目者，名「焦地留青」，除陽文書畫之外，其他染上一種深色顏料，使作焦黃色，格外襯托出深淺異致的花紋與地，非常美觀。惟此僅北平名家張志魚能之，今已傳授於優秀門弟子。南方刻竹家，鮮有能此者也。</p>
<p>工欲善其事，必先利其器！刻竹主腦器具，全仗一柄刀（有時亦要用針）。如果刻竹的刀，不能得心應手，影響作品匪淺。坊間現成的刻竹刀，首推北平王麻子鐵舖出品；然亦未見佳妙。宜乎自製！，以鐘錶機件內的彈性法條為第一。這種法條，是純鋼的原料；取其一段（不可太長，長則刻時用不出力），緊紮在竹柄上（劈竹一小段，裝刀作柄），便可使用。若淺刻蠅頭小字，當另用鋼針！為簡便起見，亦可用繡花針，以德國貨為佳。極小的行草，可用　塗黑竹面，即以鋼針劃成之；不用目力，全在手指的純熟技巧。</p>
<p>雕刻之前，取桑皮紙（他紙亦可）包裹全竹！欲刻某處，即撕去某部分的紙。否則偶不經意，書畫為手指揑去，或致糢糊失　了。</p>
<p>刻時兼用指力與腕力，但不可死命着力，要軟中帶硬；硬中帶軟，能放能收，欲去還留，那麼可免溜刀之病；也不會走樣，與原作書畫，不爽累黍。動刀之時，無論一筆一畫，先宜切斷上下兩面竹筋。次及左右，又次修底。而修底工夫，尤關重要，稍有疏忽，白圭生玷，功虧一簣了。</p>
<p>刻法有深刻，淺刻，深淺刻，平底刻，斛底刻等。深刻與淺刻，盡人能了解，毋待筆者說明。深淺刻則在一個畫面或字面之間，或深或淺，隨宜而施，非常美觀。平底刻使素地光平，一些沒有凹凸；非常美觀。平底刻使素地光平，一些沒有凹凸；斛底刻是陰文各邊，俱成斜面。前者令人感覺整潔，後者因斜面的反射，顯示筆觸刀法，格外動目。所以刻山水花鳥，宜酌量情形，或用平底，或用斛底，大都巖石麟峋宜乎斜，烟雲縹緲宜乎平，勾勒輪廓宜稍深，瀑布河流宜稍淺，神而明之，存乎其人，熟能生巧，著手咸宜，這些全是可以意會，不可以言語規範的呀。</p>
<p>陽文的素地，也有種種：如棗皮地，胡桃地，二者全同，但前者起伏較淺罷了。沙地如舖粉，盧席地，木賊地如其名。總而言之，統而言之，麻地，光地盡之矣。</p>
<p>刻竹告成之後，宜用松子油胡桃油，周徧地滋潤一下；既能掩飾新刻的火氣，又使得不易積垢蒙塵。此雖小道，大有用處。</p>
<p>貯藏刻竹器物，可用報紙包裹！因為報上鉛字，用油墨印刷，可以防蛀。否則置洋樟腦（納普太林）若干粒於竹器包內，亦有同樣功用。勿用三國樟腦，以其太乾燥，能减少竹面的實光呢。</p>

<h3 id="c119">抽煙從橫談 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>這裏是一些關於捲烟的常識與逸話，希望你能够化掉一支烟的時間來讀完它。</p>
<p>踱到馬路上，烟紙店裏陳列着五光十色的捲烟，那些美觀的裝璜，加上印着Camel　Philip　Morris等美國來路貨的商標，會引誘得你不自主的逗留一下。即使你並不是一個嗜烟若命的人，你也許會摸摸自己的錢袋。</p>
<p>捲烟的輸入中國，還是一八九〇年的事，當時的銷路僅限於上海，二年後遍及全國，五十年來，銷路突飛猛進，時至今日，捲烟的消耗，已達到可驚的程度。朋友酬酢，免不了掏出烟盒，請抽一支，精神苦悶的時候抽一支，工作疲憊的時候抽一支，飯後抽一支，大便時抽一支，無事可做的時候抽一支，編輯，作家們在深夜伏案寫作時，捲烟更爲產生「烟士披里純」的必要原料。即使一般原不大會抽烟的人，也效着口啣一支，烟霧繚繞，悠然自得。戲院，舞塲等公共娛樂塲所與學校團體機關的馬桶間，成爲捲烟消耗的大本營。有人這樣統計過：在大都市中，絕不抽烟的佔不到百分之五；在窮鄕僻壤，除了老人們還啣着旱烟筒或吸着水烟外，也差不多人手一支了。</p>
<p>吸煙的來歷</p>
<p>現在，請你燃一支烟，讓我先來吿訴你一些關於吸烟的小掌故：</p>
<p>據說，吸烟的起源，完然出於偶然。在古代歐洲某一次祭典中，一個祭神的敎士，無意間吸進了一口烟，覺得有刺激的異味，他吿訴了一般人，大家認爲這是上帝的意思，於是敎士們在舉行宗敎儀式時，把吸烟也列入了儀式之一。</p>
<p>隨後，希臘人發明烟浴，算用來祛除不潔。野蠻的西齊亞人也焚薪起烟，在烟的繚繞中舞蹈唱歌，引爲樂事。</p>
<p>美洲遠在未被發現以前，當地人早就有了吸烟的習慣，在中部美洲，還可以找出許多雕鐫着吸烟遺跡的古代石刻來。</p>
<p>由此可見吸烟的起源本來是一種宗敎儀式，到後來又被大家認爲治病的藥品。法人琴尼古曾說：吸烟能療治梅毒，咳嗽，喘息，頭痛，甲狀腺等症，至於捲烟的發明，那還是近百年的事。這便是吸烟的來歷。</p>
<p>幾段「吸煙學」</p>
<p>柏林大學敎授約翰，派立許博士是一個專門研究「吸烟與健康」的人，他認爲捲烟中含有許多猛烈的毒素，如尼古丁，西摩尼亞，蜻化物，砒霜等。但是他並不反對抽烟，他自己就是一個挺愛抽烟的人。只是他特別吿誠那些捲烟的嗜好者，切不要專吸同一種類的捲烟，必須時常變換，因爲各種捲煙所含的毒素並不一律，如果時常變換，那麼毒素就不會愈積愈多，碍及人體的健康了。</p>
<p>你喜職抽美國貨捲烟嗎？也許你現在拿在手裏正是一支「馬立斯」或者「吉士」。但恕我不識相地忠告你：據派立許博士化騐之下，美國出品的捲烟，所含的毒素最重。土耳其烟次之，至於中國產捲烟，就比較好得多了。</p>
<p>關於吸烟中毒的原因，根據巴德那·納格和狄格曼諸醫師的研究，平常吸烟時，人體可吸收百分之六十以上的菸草素，若是將烟吸入肺內，則人體所吸收的菸草素可達百分之九十三·普通在一千公分烟草內，約含菸草素二分至七分不等，每日抽烟四十支的，即有菸草素二百二十四公絲吸入體內，若是一個素不抽烟的，使他一次吸入二十公絲，已有致命的危險。</p>
<p>菸草素的毒害影響，呈現於心臟及血脈管內。因菸草素可以增高吸烟人的血壓，造成血管硬化的病理現象，更至造成心臟擴大症。此外，又能刺激系統，尤其消化器官，並使心臟神經中樞癱瘓。</p>
<p>但是，話說回來，健康的人，稍吸兩支捲烟，究竟並無多大害處。只是不可多吸，每日無論如何不能超過四十支。若素有心臟病，肺病的人，還以不吸爲是。</p>
<p>談含英咀華</p>
<p>打開烟盒來，一支支整齊的捲烟呈露在你的眼前，白色的紙包着金黃色的烟葉，看似製造它很簡單，其實從烟葉子切成絲，從絲捲成烟支，其中經過，却是非常麻煩。你若不嫌嚕囌，我願把捲烟的製造程序作一個簡約的叙述：</p>
<p>第一步是配葉，每一嘜頭由廠長交出後，就由副手過磅，譬如須用葉子四千磅，則用一百磅容量的籐籮四十只，每箱內盛有各種成份的烟葉，然後交蒸葉車蒸軟。蒸後山動帶運往去頭部，（ButtingDapt.）切下的葉頭交烟筋部，烟葉是入香料桶，加配香料，在木箱內再行過磅，俟二十四小時後，交切烟部切絲，以四分之三密立米爲標準。上等烟則先蒸一次，交撕葉部拆筋，再放入蒸葉車覆蒸，加香料放入箱內，於二十小時後切絲備用。至於烟筋亦須配料，軋扁切絲，另行焙乾，用篩末車節過，將長者放入焙烟筒，混入於烟絲內。</p>
<p>焙乾了的烟絲存積於烟絲房內，烟絲房備有熱氣管。潮氣管，應時而用。然後把這些烟絲交捲烟車，就有成千累萬的烟支捲出。捲出後，付錫包間裝包，然後裝箱貼花，出磅發售。</p>
<p>在你手裏的一支捲烟，便是經過了這樣繁複的歷程而製造出來的，當你在「含英咀華」的時候，可曾想到它的來處不易嗎？</p>
<p>香煙的畫片</p>
<p>從前捲烟盒中，往往放入畫片，以作招徠營業之用。它的產生是在一八九四年，英國MessrsWills發明在包內放入小畫片，這種小畫片是世界第一種香烟畫片，畫面是一百個兵士。此後大家爭相仿傚，香烟畫片就盛行起來了。有些專事收集此類畫片的人，像那些郵票收藏家一樣，盡他的一生來從事他的工作，在英國數十年前的畫片，可以値到好幾十個金鎊。有一張畫片是叙述Winston　Churchill從Pretoria逃走的故事，印在拿破崙第三的像後面，現在認爲名貴非凡，許多收藏家願以巨價收買那張畫片。</p>
<p>外國，有專門收買香烟畫片的公司，營業極爲發達，有一片收羅着數十萬不同的畫片，雇用着三千個收集員替他收集。</p>
<p>中國幾年前也有好許多人收集捲烟盒裏關於封神榜或西遊記裏的人像畫片，尤其是小孩子，對香烟畫片最是愛不忍釋。</p>
<p>一個冒昧的提議：假如香烟畫片採用好的圖書與敎材，倒也未始不是一種良好的敎育。而且收效一定很大，我想。</p>
<p>救救捲煙業</p>
<p>拉雜地寫了許多，最後要說到中國現在的捲烟工業。</p>
<p>美國貨擁到聲中，捲烟亦爲主要物品之一。由於國人認爲「來路貨一定嶄」的心理，加以價錢不貴，因此Camel　Philip　Mor-ris,　Lucky　Strike,　Raleigh等的美國捲烟，已佔有大部份中級社會的吸烟者。國產捲烟雖較便宜些，但相差只有一二百元，對顧客顯然已失却它的誘惑力，中國的捲烟工業已滿呈着不景氣－不，已達到即將崩潰的時候了。</p>
<p>看看報紙上的消息吧：——</p>
<p>「廣州市近以無稅洋姻充斥市面，土捲烟慘受打擊八十餘家廠商相率倒閉者六十餘家，形勢嚴重。捲烟工人失業，已達三萬。……」（六月五日申報）</p>
<p>「本廠因受外貨壓迫，近來銀根奇緊，加之工友索費日急，萬難維持，不得已惟有破釜沉舟，宣吿淸理。」（七月十七日明星烟廠宣言淸理賬目公吿）</p>
<p>看看你手中的捲烟吧，是不是也是外國貨？似如是的，請你想想中國烟草工業的沒落慘狀吧！請你想想中國民族工業的前途吧！請你想想國家利權外溢的天文數字吧！請你想想那無數在飢餓綫上掙孔的失業工人吧！你還忍心抽外國烟麽？（寫在國際捲姻節前夕）</p>
<h3 id="c120">捲煙工業的難關　鮑爾訪問記 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 蒼夫</p>
<p>外商資本組織的頤中烟草公司，在太平洋戰前，向以資力雄厚，規模宏大，設備完善，產品豐富等優惠的生產條件著稱。母怪它會牢牢地掌握住我國捲烟事業的牛耳。此番勝利後，頤中烟草公司對這些優惠的條件，雖並未喪失，然而隨着國內經濟環境的變遷，道龐大的外商烟草機構，業務也似乎轉趨消沉，無復當年全盛時代的姿態。記者爲了明瞭該公司目前的處境，特地去訪問該公司的業務經理鮑爾先生。鮑爾先生就該公司目前所遭遇到的困難，分四點爲記者侃侃而叙。</p>
<p>原料</p>
<p>首先，他提出捲烟原料的獲取問題。據說：目前該公司所需的主要原料，不外烟葉，捲烟紙，木材，以及捲烟機上所用到的種種配件等四項。談到烟葉，比較品質高超的，該是山東，河南，及安徽各省所產的美種烟葉。這些省份，在戰前都能大量生產。戰事爆發後，鐵路交通斷絕，煤斤，肥料，新鮮烟種等，樣樣都吿缺乏。於是烟葉生產的質量就大打折扣。不僅唯是，戰前各正當的烟商，都能直接到各產烟區，與各烟農直接購買烟葉。戰事却替一輩投機家造就了機會。他們一方面是低價向烟農收買，使烟農沒勇氣再植烟種。一方面又利用產量的减少，來造就他們龍斷操縱的機會。於是，烟葉的市價，已漲到廠商不能負担的地步。要補救這些缺點，鮑先生認爲應該設法恢復交通，帮助烟農獲取煤斤，肥料，新鮮菸種。同時，應利便正當烟商，直接與各烟農購買烟葉。才能使烟農得到合理的代價，來鼓勵他們增產。</p>
<p>紙品</p>
<p>至於捲烟業方面所應用的各種紙品，鮑先生認爲種類相當的多。可是，國內的產品，着實不易找到。而世界各國，也正鬧着缺貨，木材一項，大多是用於捲烟的打包方面的。目前的供給量很少，而價錢却驚人的高。至於捲烟機配件的獲取問題，目前更感迫切。據說：該公司所屬各廠的機器，在敵人盤踞期間，析舊和耗損率極重。需要大量的機器配件補充裝修，方能恢復到戰前全盛時代的生產效率。可是，這些配件大部是仰給於國外的。配件到達的遲緩，無形中也延緩了生產效率的恢復。</p>
<p>生產</p>
<p>第二點困難，鮑先生談到該公司目前的生產問題。據說已是不堪回首話當年了！他列舉了三點原因（一）所屬工廠，大部停工或處於半停工狀熊中。據說該公司在漢口主要的工廠，以及所屬的全部機器設備，都已燬於轟炸。　陽營口兩地分廠，全部停工。天津靑島兩地分廠，則處於半停工狀態中，這些都因爲沿海及他種交通完全斷絕之後，該公司無法供給各分廠以急需的主要原料，有以致之。上海浦東方面的工廠，在目前的處境下，也無法開工。原因是無法保證使煤斤能源源不斷的供應，而且即使有的話，這煤斤的價格，也將高得使該公司無法購買。</p>
<p>運貨</p>
<p>此外，自浦東到浦西這段駁運搬遷各費，更大得驚人。所以浦東工廠，目前也無法在經濟的條件下生產。（二）勞工成本太貴。該公司每月按照生活指數，給付勞工的工資。生活指數日漲夜高，該公司實感無法支持。（三）原料價高，而又短絀。該公司目前雖設法補充戰前各種品質高超的原料，但目前還不能立刻全部辦到，不得不摻用各種普通的品質的原料，聊資補充。可是生產效率，却因此大受影響，然單就這種普通原料而言，價格已貴得可以。特別是那筆搬運費，往往反超過了原料本身的價格。</p>
<p>基於上述的種種原因，鮑先生說：他們現在的生產情形，完全是不經濟的。他們現在生產的政策，完全是爲他們員工的福利着想。</p>
<p>煙稅</p>
<p>鮑先生所談到的第三點困難是：國內對原料和製成品的課稅太重。這樣一來，國內的捲烟事業被打倒了。而國外來的捲烟，却能在國內的市塲上暢銷。據說製成品的課稅辦法，設計得不夠週密。同時，稅率條例的施行，也並不理想。課稅標準是根據膨脹了的批發市價計算的。付稅者對這些市價計算得來的辦法，也不盡明瞭。</p>
<p>分銷</p>
<p>最後的困難，鮑先生認爲是製成品的分銷問題。他設目前的交通情形，完全一團糟！就拿上海和天津兩大商埠問的交通而言，一般廠商，就感無法獲取船位。這樣徒然替投機家造就了機會。他們想盡各種不正的勾當，設法把貨運銷。結果毋怪消費者無法以合理的價格，買到捲烟。還有暗息的高翔，使正常的分鴵機構，無法民開業務。末了，課稅辦法的不理想，正當的廠商，當然不願利用這些稅則的弱點，結果造成不法廠商儘量設法逃稅，而正當廠商，却徒負稅率重荷。</p>

<h3 id="c121">外煙傾銷　民族捲煙工業　轉入下坡路 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 寸軍</p>
<p>現在，當勝利的鐘聲響了的時候，我們這意外收穫的民族捲烟工業，却又意外地轉向衰落的下坡去了。各色各樣的「美式配備」：駱駝牌·志士牌·幸運牌·馬立斯牌等各種美製名烟，都是差不多與美軍同時免稅進口的。當我們這些勝利公民，開始悠然地吸着價廉物美的美烟時，我們的民族捲烟工業，却又面臨着一種空前的威脅！</p>
<p>跟着軍用捲烟之後，自本年年初以來，美製捲烟進口的數字，不管它如何消耗着我們寶貴的外滙，是逐月在增進中！根據上海貨物稅局納稅的標準，今年一月至七月間美烟進口的數字，大概有如下述：</p>
<p>月份　進口捲烟枝數</p>
<p>一月份　一五〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>二月份　四，五〇〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>三月份　二，一六〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>四月份　三三，〇六〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>五月份　二三，五〇〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>六月份　一五八，〇二六，七〇〇枝</p>
<p>七月份　三七，五七〇，〇〇〇枝</p>
<p>（星期一）</p>
<p>總共　三五七，九六六，七〇〇枝</p>
<p>這樣，美烟進口的數字，實已到達驚人地步了！因為時間關係，七月份的全部進口數字目前還不能得到。但根傳聞據稱七月份全部進口的美烟數字，約等於上海全部華洋商烟廠所生產的捲烟總額的四分之一！長此而往，民族捲烟工業的前途，實是不堪設想的。</p>
<h3 id="c122">國產捲烟　為什麽銷不過外烟 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>為什麽外烟能這樣在國內市場上暢銷呢？簡括言之，價廉物美而已，現在差不多人人都知道，國外的生活費用，遠較國內為廉。其實，不但如此，國外廠家規模宏大，歷史悠久，技術精良，設備完全，經騐豐富，資本充足，在在多非國廠足以相提並論。以事實論之，在今日中國的局面，內戰未停，交通不能恢復，通貨　　膨漲，生活日益高升，工潮疊見之際，政府如再不採取有效的保護政策，那不但是捲烟工業，任何民族工業都是不能生存的。</p>
<p>現在請將國內外捲烟的生產成本作一比較如下：</p>
<p>近來市上出售的一般美國紙烟，具有最考究之裝璜品，所用烟絲僅稍低於少數最上等之美國烟者，如馬立斯，駱駝牌等，其定價每千枝僅售美金一元八角八分，每五萬枝為美金九十四元（以上係在紐約交貨者）。如在上海交貨，則每千枝價為美金二元〇六分，每五萬枝為美金一百另三元。即按照上海流行之五萬枝裝箱，每箱價格折合法幣僅廿一萬元左右。如再加全部各種課稅約一百分之二百四十七，約得價法幣七十四萬元。</p>
<p>再以英國烟品質頗同於聽裝三砲台者，就其價格作一分析：每箱來價約法幣四十萬元（五萬枝裝箱）加上一百份之二百四十七的各種捐稅，共計法幣一百卅九萬元。但十枝紙裝之國產捲烟如美麗牌，五萬枝裝箱價即須一百三十萬元其品質與裝璜以此聽裝之英國烟相較，具差別當然是極大的。</p>
<p>再進，如上海國產烟廠欲製造一烟，其裝璜品質須與美製馬立斯，駱駝牌相等，則其成本須如下：</p>
<p>（一）原料及裝璜品</p>
<p>烟葉　一三五磅（每磅二千元計算）等於二七〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>捲烟紙　二〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>鋼精紙　一〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>商標　四五、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>外包透明紙　七〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>大紙盒（條盒）　一五、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>大紙盒外用封紙　一、八〇〇元</p>
<p>木箱　八、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>等於四三九、八〇〇元</p>
<p>（二）製造費用</p>
<p>燃料　五、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>電動力　四二〇元</p>
<p>膠水　二、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>管理費用　三〇、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>撕烟葉工資　八、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>包烟工資　二四、〇〇〇元</p>
<p>等於六九、四二〇元</p>
<p>兩共總計五〇九、二二〇元</p>
<p>根據現行貨物稅條例捲烟稅須值百抽百，故廠盤如須五一〇、〇〇〇元須納稅五一〇、〇〇〇元。易言之，美烟售價為七四〇、〇〇〇元，國烟（同質）則至少須售一、〇二〇、〇〇〇元。相差達二八〇、〇〇〇之巨，但如欲使裝璜與美貨完全相同更非技術上所能做到。</p>
<p>如國產商削價以事競爭，每箱與美貨同售七十四萬元。據現行稅制，每箱應付稅法幣三十四萬四千二百元（接「售價＝廠盤＋百分之百貨物稅＋百分之十五運費」計算）廠方凈得為法幣三十九萬五千八百元。如此每箱成本五十一萬元計，每箱須賠本法幣十一萬元以上。</p>
<p>由是觀之，現行外烟進口稅制為尚未能盡保護關稅之職責與機能。在此稅制之下民族捲烟工業將絕無與外烟競爭的可能。</p>
<p>然則外烟進口各種課稅相加共須課稅一百分之二百四十七，這是從何而來的呢？</p>
<p>美烟進口各種　稅如下：</p>
<p>貨價（C.I.F）＋10％（從船上嚴運至經售者之一切雜費）</p>
<p>關稅80％（貨價＋10％）</p>
<p>總共所付各種稅＝約247％（貨價）</p>
<p>綜上所述，我們當知外烟進口所行稅制係各種並行稅相加而成。至國產捲烟稅制初視之似較外烟為累，即值百抽百（外烟須值百抽二百四十七）。但此項稅制係屬稅上加稅制度。我們烟廠的原料如烟葉在未製成捲烟前即已抽稅（按現行烟葉稅，凡本國種植之烟葉從價征百分之三十，外國之進口烟葉須從價徵百分之四十一）其他各種原料亦無一不早抽稅，再加每種原料之營業稅與印花稅，總共在未製成捲烟以前，各廠早已付過　稅十餘種之多。而現行貨物稅即在這許多稅抽過以後再值百抽百。因此，事實上，國產烟所交的稅額當比外烟為重。根據現行國產烟抽稅方法，外烟統稅抽稅應如下，方稱公允。即：</p>
<p>（進口貨價＋關稅）值百抽百</p>
<p>捲烟雖係消耗品，但外國抽稅都不及中國之重。如美國對烟葉是不抽稅的，他們的廠商只付捲烟稅；英國的稅制是只抽烟葉的進口稅；英國的稅制是只抽烟葉的進口稅，對於本國產的捲烟是不抽稅的。而且他們的捲烟出口稅統是免稅的。我國製成捲烟要抽稅，烟葉不論其為國產的或進口來的一概都要抽稅。</p>
<p>中國民族捲烟廠商，宜及早注意獨力不能自存，如現在仍不能放棄成見，去組成一堅强的聯營機構，以應付未來嚴重的局面，否則今日這一點數年來辛勤得來的基礎，終有全部覆滅的危機。</p>
<h3 id="c123">上下古今談煙草 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>捲烟，可以說是人間最普遍的消遣品了。中國人在很早的時候，　有吸食青條，皮絲等國產烟的習慣。手裏托了一只水烟袋，和家屬，親戚，朋友隨便談話，其旁復佐以清茶一杯，是中國舊時代閒適生活的一種表徵。其後中外通商，捲烟也隨着到中國來，中國人為了杜寒漏巵，挽回利權起見，也就在國內廣植烟草，設廠製造，經二三十年的奮鬥之後，已經在工業落後的中國，建立相當規模。假如我國在烟草工業方面能够自給自足，那麼對於中國的經濟生活，也可能發生重大的影響。</p>
<p>現在我們把有關烟草的智識，介紹一些在後面。</p>
<p>試先說一些烟草的歷史。據一般的說法，吸食烟草的習慣，</p>
<h3 id="c124">始於美洲 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>然後再傳佈到世界各地。一四九二年十一月間，哥侖布的探險隊開到了古巴，發現當地的土人，用一根長管插在嘴裏，另一頭則用火燃燒一種草類，把烟吸到肚裏去。其後美洲大陸逐漸被開發，探險家們逐漸發現當地吸食烟草的習慣是極普遍的一件事情，並且歷史悠久，幾乎無法追溯始於何年何日。</p>
<p>誰都知道烟草這個名稱的英文字是Tobacco，但是這個字的來源似乎並不從這種植物的原來名稱產生的。以前聖多明瓦居民，在吸食烟草時使用一種Y形的管子，兩頭塞在鼻孔中，另一頭則燃點烟草，這種管子在當地就呌做Tabaco，烟草的英文名字，或許就從這個字演變而來。但是也有人說墨西哥地方先前就把Tabacco稱呌烟草這種植物的。</p>
<p>至於烟草帶到歐洲去，是在一五五八年帶的人是弗南特斯。他是一個醫生。</p>
<p>西班牙國一菲利普二世派他到墨西哥去考察物產的。第一人把烟草種子帶到歐洲去的，是法國駐葡萄牙大使尼哥，科學界為紀念他的功績起見，烟草的學術名字就呌做尼哥蒂那。當時一般人都以為烟草對於醫療疾病具有奇效，英國大詩人史本塞就在他的詩篇中把烟草呌做「神草」。後來經勞蘭爵士一提倡，吸食烟草的習慣就盛行於歐洲各國的宮廷大臣之間。在十七世紀中，烟草的銷路不脛而走，差不多是家家戶戶的東西了。</p>
<p>為了烟草的銷路激增，各國種植烟葉的事業，一天一天比擴大。目下，世界上產烟著名的國家，當推美國和土耳其，此外，如中南美各國，聯合王國，菲律濱，南洋各地，也都產烟，中國產烟草的地方，以河南和廣西為最著，當地的氣候和土壤，宜於種植烟草，將來如能用科學方法加以改良，一定能够有更好的收穫，這是國產捲烟企業家應該加以注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c125">化學成分 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>至於烟草的未發酵和已發酵的化學成分，在性質上略有差別，大致如下：</p>
<p>未發酵的　已發酵的</p>
<p>（百分率）　（百分率）</p>
<p>水　二三·五〇　二三·四〇</p>
<p>灰　一四·八九　一五·二七</p>
<p>尼哥丁　二·五〇　一·七九</p>
<p>硝酸（N2O5）　一·八九　一·七九</p>
<p>阿摩尼亞NH3　〇·六七　〇·七一</p>
<p>其他氮化物　一二·一九　一三·三一</p>
<p>纖維　七·九〇　八·七八</p>
<p>澱物質　三·二〇　三·三六</p>
<p>氮化物精夜　二九·三九　二七·九九</p>
<p>醚精　三·八七　三·四二</p>
<p>烟草的品質，以愈陳為愈佳。時間愈長，烟味就愈醇厚而無火氣。但是發酵作用，也可以使烟味改善，此外還可以加各種香料，配合得得當，味道當然可以更其美妙。為了求國產捲烟的暢銷，在製造方面必須立求精良，務使烟味芬芳，品質劃一，這在製造商方面，實在是一件不容忽視的事情。</p>
<p>在商業競爭非常激烈的世界上，優勝劣敗還是最基本的公理。為了保全我國的捲烟市場，為了保全我國工業的命脈，中國的製造商必須急起直追，尤其對於中國人在烟味方面的癖好，必須多用工夫，庶幾乎可以達到中國人吸中國烟的目的。</p>
<h3 id="c126">嗜烟若命 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>西班牙內戰時期，馬德里被圍時間極長，對外交通完全斷絕。西班牙人是嗜烟若命的，在這種情形之下，烟草的供應成了極大的問題。凡是有吸食捲烟習慣的人，可以想像得出馬德里人一種難受的滋味。適巧在這個時候，有幾個美國記者經當局特准到馬德里城內來。他們來的目的，無非是採訪消息，所以常在市街上走動。不久他們發覺背後常有人跟着，不覺大吃一驚，以為有什麽間牒在偵察他們的行動，但是日子久了，真相終告大白，原來這輩人是在等候美國人丟掉吃剩的香烟頭，想借此過一口癮！</p>
<h3 id="c127">榮蘭爵士 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>吸食烟草的習慣，歐洲人在十五世紀以前是完全不知道的。英國伊麗莎白女王時代，是宮廷中一位極有聲望的人物。有一天，他不知從什麽地方弄到了一些好烟草，就獨自坐在房間裏大吸起來，樣子非常閒適，當其時也，有僕人一名自外邊跑進來，深恐主人有何分付，身畔無人侍奉。但是不進去猶可，一進去看見了主人吞雲吐霧的情形，却使他直跳起來，立刻轉身跑去，提了一桶水來，向主人身上直澆，嘴裏還不斷地嚷着：「不對，不對，主人的肚裏着火了……。」</p>

<p>據商務部估計：一九四六年度中國烟草出產，將達十億零兩千五百萬磅，雖較戰前為少，但較一九四五年增加一倍以上。本年七月至明年七月間，全世界烟葉出產，將達六十六億五千四百萬磅</p>

<h3 id="c129">謹用此「父親頌」　紀念八八父親節　父親的責任感 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 康屯</p>
<p>大凡做父親的當然希望子女能盡孝道。可是在父親本身方面，也得時時反省，自己是否確盡了父道？此處且舉一個尋常的實例：</p>
<p>我有一個久別重逢的女親眷，在七八年前嫁了一個較長二十來歲的丈夫。我問她「是不是續絃？」「不是的」。「那末以您這般才貌，怎麼嫁個相差如許年齡的丈夫呢？」「說起這件事，便要埋怨我的父親。我父親是個商場中人物，他和我母親的婚姻，本是很美滿的。可是自從我母親生了我姊妹兩人，我從小便常見我父親因為在外荒唐，歸來虐待我母親。一言不合，便拳足交加。把女兒教育的事也竟不放在心上，以致我雖是中上家庭的女兒而老早就失學了。我看了我父親種種的不是，和母親日常受到精神上的痛苦，便立下決心，不嫁便罷，要嫁得嫁個年齡大過於我，性情和善，而能允許我負担養老我母親的，方肯嫁給他。雖然向我求婚的人，絡繹不斷結，果我便在八年前嫁了這合我條件的丈夫。……我為了我父親的不能確盡夫道，為了顯全母親的晚景，便犧牲我自己，降低我的擇大標準。」</p>
<p>「您對於父親節要不要有什麽表示？」</p>
<p>「我不預備有什麽表示，我只有個希望，希望做父親的人不要犯我父親同樣的過失。」</p>
<p>接着她又告訴我她一個女友的父親怎樣愛護他的女兒，怎樣善待他的太太，形容得幾乎使我掉下淚來。</p>
<p>我相信一切人情道理都該是相對的。像虞舜待眷　這種片面的　孝，究竟是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>像上海這個社會裏，驕奢浮　，達於極點，男子總希望女子　做「賢妻良母」，希望兒女能做「孝子淑女」，却並不約束自己做個「貞夫慈父」，又怎樣能使做子女的人竭誡盡歡於這個「父親節」而了無遺憾呢？</p>
<h3 id="c130">父親節　父親急 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 祈茶</p>
<p>八月八日是父親節。</p>
<p>做了父親，對於子女的一筆教育費，又得煞費一番苦心，親友們頌賀你子女成行，真是天倫樂事。但，「養不教，你子過」，八月轉瞬即過，學校又將開學，偌大的一筆學雜費用，到那裏去張羅呢</p>
<p>父親節，父親急！</p>
<p>「人人都有父親，人人應該紀念父親節；紀念父親，就是做人的起點。」這是父親節推行委員會所揭示的標語。</p>
<p>不知漢奸子女看了作何感想？</p>
<p>好像汪逆文悌宣判時，主審官轉諄諄地勸他道：「你要學你父親的上半世，切勿效他的後半世。」</p>
<p>父親節能令人反省一下自己，這才是父親節最崇高的意義。</p>
<h3 id="c131">上海人的心理 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 金路</p>
<p>—從「義舞」說起—</p>
<p>蘇北難民救濟協會，在「義舞」之後，又有選舉「上海小姐」來助賑的辦法。為了蘇北三百萬難民的「命」，我們對於救濟協會諸公，大動腦筋後所用的方法，祇要想得出；能多募幾個錢，多救幾條命的，自然非常贊成，無話可說。</p>
<p>不過我們看了「舞女」義舞，跟選舉上海「小姐」之後，心裏頭不由地連想到「上海人的心理」起來；為什麽此次助賑，不用古今名人書畫義賣等而用這二個「盛舉」？顯而易見，這是為了上海人的心理。實亦不能抹煞其聰明和苦心。</p>
<p>上海人終究是最乖覺的，最現實的；他們最喜做一舉兩得而名利雙收的事；最好是坐享權利，不盡義務；他們決不肯白白化錢，化錢一定要收回相當代價。以前的義演義費，廣告有云：「既可一飽眼福，又屬賑災善事，一舉兩得，何樂不為，蓋興乎來！此次義舞，並無類此廣告，大可代擬如下：「既可一摟纖腰，又麗賑災善舉……」的確，上海人就在這種「醉翁之意不在酒」的假面具幌子下生長起來的。</p>
<p>在緊接「義舞」之後而來的，却是「七十萬元的舞弊」，這真是貨真價實的「舞弊」了。「舞弊病」最近在上海流行，正像時疫一樣地蔓延着。可悲又可歎，直令人啼笑皆非！</p>
<p>記得在「八一三」後的一個中秋節晚上，有人在「舉首望明月，低頭吃月餅」。每當咬一口月餅時，就想起東北的一方失地；再咬一口時，又想起一方失地，最後把月餅吃光，抹抹嘴說：「唉！我們這大好桑葉，也要給蠶食盡了」！我真佩服這人的好胃口，那種「悲管悲，吃管吃」的安閒本領，實屬費解，令人五體投地。</p>
<p>用這種僅僅滿足個人的慾　，換來的錢去助賑，總不是好方法！因為在快樂中寄予沈痛的同情和援助，是病態的；不真實的；同時，這種不是本人類互助的同情心所出發的行為，是脆弱的，暫時的。他們的目的，却並不是賑災，他們不過化幾個錢，快樂一下自己而已；他們很少知道蘇北為什麽會有人流亡？更早忘了湘豫桂粵嚴重的災情了，真所謂：「不知有漢，無論魏晋」哩！</p>
<p>所以，上海人應該趕快把這種玩玩的病態心理，完全改變過來，越快越好。同時，本着人類互助的天性；自動地，不取償地，予以援助，有力出力，有錢出錢。那末，這種以少數人的快樂換錢來助賑的方法，不再會給人重視，更不會在報上看到：「多跳一隻舞，多救一條命」的那種不調和的廣告了！</p>
<p>諸位想想，下面的這封信，是什麽地方，什麽樣人會有的。</p>
<h3 id="c132">致父親同志的信 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>父親××同志：</p>
<p>對於你所領導的家，我們顯然不能滿意！在血統　上，你是我們的直系「　親」，但在家的組織上，你是我們的公僕；你對於我們的服務，正等於我們對於你的第三代服和一樣。基於整個家庭大衆的利益，我們有非常充分的理由和權利，請你注意：對於你的無能與反動，我們不能也不願繼續緘默。我們已經由絕對多數的決定，從即日起，廢止你對於家的領導權。換句話說，對內你應當交出經濟權，對外你不能代表我們的家！詳細辦法，見另附的備忘錄中。</p>
<p>必須請你注意：「少數服從多數，個人服從組織！」通過了民主方式的決定，我們有權命令你接受！這決定如果不能被接受，我們將考慮舉行家庭大會，大會有權公開審判任何破壞家庭民主的反動分子！</p>
<p>你對於我們在「　」方面的行為，顯然認識不够，因而作無理的干涉；我們已屢次提出嚴重抗議，請你停止這不友好的敵對態度以及取消經濟的封鎖！但你公然輕視我們的抗議。我們認為兩性的行為，是單純的個人事情，我們有充分的權利來處理，我們認為家庭經濟應當公開，對於你的收入，我們有共同處分權；但是由於你先天的頑固和後天的落伍，對於我們的權益，毫無保障！為了人權，我們五個兄妹以及你的妻子，特地聯名通知你：請你在四十八小時以內，實行備忘錄中所提出的辦法！我們將儘量使這些辦法能够用和平的方式實現！</p>
<p>我們將不考慮與你重新協商，因為你與我們之間，有着不能統一的矛盾！</p>
<p>為了家庭的和平與統一，民主與自由，我們宣佈：我們的「兄妹護家委員會」，即日執行家的統治權！致家的解放敬禮！　八月八日</p>

<p>— 羅汀澤</p>
<p>那個給戰爭困倦了的美國兵士，在歐洲留了有三十二個月，一經踏上了祖國的領土，便急忙趕到臨近的公用電話站上，興冲冲地打電話給他的妻子。同時他以同樣的心緒，也許還過一點，想聽到他兒子的聲音。當他離開家庭時，那孩子還不會說話；現在根據他母親的來信，孩子已三歲，在牙牙地學說話了。</p>
<p>他以很緊張的情緒等候接綫，然後，很興奮地聽到了他妻子久別的聲音，接着又歇止了。歇了很多時候，才聽到他的孩子含糊的拿話筒的聲音。但沒有什麽—孩子並沒有說一句。</p>
<p>「那是爸爸，孩子，知道嗎？」母親說着，「叫一聲：哈囉，爸爸」。</p>
<p>孩子並沒有說。</p>
<p>「說呀！哈囉。」母親催促着。</p>
<p>但依然靜靜的。</p>
<p>孩子的母親試了又試，想使孩子依着他說，但都沒有做到，於是他以最後一着，設法誘他說。「孩子，對爸爸說：哈囉。回頭買糖給你吃。」</p>
<p>過了很多時候，那久等的爸爸總算聽到了他孩子的一句話：「媽咪，是什麽糖？」</p>
<h3 id="c134">父親（上） <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>一個真實的故事</p>
<p>我默默地呆住了。</p>
<p>唉！叫我如何回答？</p>
<p>父親繼續問：「樑，你預備升學呢，還是去做生意？」</p>
<p>仍舊是那付懇　的。新切的聲音向我心中直刺。</p>
<p>唉！誰願意做一個　　為利的市僧？</p>
<p>回頭，我看見天真爛漫的弟妹們在嬉戲，再有，我瞧見慈母的憂鬰的，滿懷着熱望的眼光，注視着我，在期待着我回答。</p>
<p>忽然，陡的記起了付學費時那些困難，入大學的希望冷淡了，最後，從齒縫中迸出這幾個字：「做生意吧！」</p>
<p>在夜深人靜的時候，我抱枕飲泣。</p>
<p>可是，我又覺察自己的自私，父親費了許多心血將我撫養成人，當然希望我幫助他支持家庭的。</p>
<p>並且，他為了我們也曾受過許多氣，尤其是學期結束時，向人借錢時所受到的那付難堪的冷面孔，一提起父親籌劃學費時的困難，往事如銀幕般一一反映在眼前了。</p>
<p>前年，一個暑假中，我跟着父親到一家汽車行裏去，父親在事前並沒有告訴我所以到那裏去的原因，我也並沒有問。</p>
<p>那汽車行經理與父親所說的話，或許是因為我不感興趣，所以沒有完全聽進去，不過有幾句話我是始終記得的。</p>
<p>那人指着我說：「他讀書怎樣？」</p>
<p>「因為還算聰明，所以想讓他中學畢業，我想請你老人家幫……。」</p>
<p>那人不等父親說完，便搶着說：「這種人讓他去學生意吧！讀了書也沒有甚麽用的。」輕蔑，鄙視滿溢於言語中。</p>
<p>「職業在現在的時候是很難找的……」</p>
<p>「我自己近來手頭很拮据，生意也不很好，所以不能……」他面上浮起一層有些像冷嘲般的笑意，其在後面咕噥地說：「讀不起書，給他讀甚麽書。死要撐面子！」</p>
<p>我抬頭望望父親，看見父親緊咬著牙齒。</p>
<p>去年，父親賦閒在家，可是憑着他的手腕，我們一家九口沒有　炊，你要知道在這世界上立足是很難的，尤其是一個自不識丁的人。可是父親雖不識字，他卻支持了這些只知道張口吃飯的一羣。</p>
<p>也是在暑假中吧，我要去應考獎學金，父親竭力阻止我，他說學費他會設法的　為了不願使父親在炎炎的赤日下奔跑，我終於去加入了獎學金的考試。</p>
<p>結果，名落孫山！</p>
<p>我忍不住笑了一天，父親却來勸慰我。</p>
<p>我覺察到父親所以阻止我的原因，他知道我不會取，並且他不願叫我受打擊。</p>
<p>我深感激他的苦心。</p>
<p>有個人來對父親說，他肯供給父親錢用。假使父親能到他那裏去做事，不，去做「官」，偽官，一個「偽局長」的肥缺，等待着他走馬上任。</p>
<p>父親不待那人說完，便立刻回絕了。</p>
<p>父親說假使他去做這種事，雖然，我們有了學費，可是將來我們不能在社會上立足了。</p>
<p>他自己倒不怎樣，雖然，他也絕對不甘屈節的，不過他說，他無論如何不讓他的子女們有「漢奸的兒子」的稱呼。</p>
<p>父親說即使我們一家餓得將死的時候，也不應該扯白旗的。</p>
<p>後來，在開學的前一日，父親給我錢，命我去付學費。他說：「孩子，你要用些功！這錢拿去付學費，記住！這錢是用很正當的手段換來的，並且，我可以說，這錢是很神聖的」。</p>
<p>我唯唯着，便去整理學校用品，預備到學校中去，當我將走的時候，父親喚住我，輕聲的對我說：「孩子，你要好好的聽母親的話，因為這錢是用你母親惟一所有和惟一所心愛的首飾去兌換來的」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battle in Suburbs, Power Cut Off: Datong's Situation Extremely Critical; Zhengtai Railway Entirely Under Intense Attack <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The fierce offensive launched by the Communist army in Shanxi has now placed Datong in a critical situation. The Communist army has deployed over 300,000 troops, commanded by He Long and Xiao Ke. On the 4th, they captured Kouquan Town Coal Mine, 20 kilometers west of Datong, and continued to fiercely attack the Mingfuquan Airfield, 5 kilometers east of Datong, which they captured. The Pingwang power plant was also occupied, cutting off the power supply to Datong city. The Communist army is determined to capture Datong at all costs, hence Datong is now in extreme danger.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Amid the urgent calls from Datong, today a reporter specially visited General Ma Zhanshan at his private residence in Beiping. According to him, he received a telegram yesterday afternoon stating that after Kouquan, southwest of Datong, was occupied, the Pingwang power plant was also captured by the Communist army. Datong's power supply has now been cut off, and the city is plunged into darkness at night. Fierce fighting is currently underway at Gushan, north of the city. More than ten strongholds east of the city, including Caifulou, Zhujiazhuang, Haidong Village, and Shaling, are all engaged in fierce fighting. The airfield east of Datong is now under threat, making it difficult for aircraft to land, thus military supplies are becoming difficult. The defending troops have some food and fuel reserves, which can last for a while, but the food and fuel for hundreds of thousands of people are a significant problem. The besieging Communist army is reportedly about thirty regiments, while the defending troops are the 2nd Division of the Northeast Advancement Army and some local teams, whose strength is quite weak.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] To coordinate with the offensive in northern Shanxi, the Communist army has launched a full-scale attack on the Zhengtai Railway, the only link between Shanxi and Beiping-Tianjin. The railway has been out of service since the day before yesterday. Trains west of Shijiazhuang only reach Weishui. The Communist army's attack began on the night of the 3rd, attacking Shanghu, Baiyangshu, Yangquan, Duanting, Lujiazhuang, Mashou, Luanliu, Xiapanishi, Dongzhao, and other stations, all of which were fiercely attacked. Among them, Baiyang Station has already fallen, and some bridges have been destroyed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Military news: The battles around Datong are still raging. More than ten strongholds east of the city, including Haili Village, Zhujiazhuang, Caifulou, and Shaling, are still in fierce fighting. Shuibo Temple, near the airfield, was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. Currently, the most pressing attempt of the Communist army seems to be to destroy and occupy the Datong airfield. Furthermore, Huai'ren County and Xinquan in Shanxi have been captured by the 6th Regiment of the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] The Communist army shifted its offensive to Kouquan Town, southwest of Datong. After a brave counterattack by the National army, they were repelled. On the 5th, the Communist army reinforced heavily and attacked fiercely again. After a day of fierce fighting, the National army slightly shifted to the northeast due to the disparity in numbers, and the town was captured by the Communist army. The situation in Datong is extremely tense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] Regarding the Communist army's attacks on the National army and the occupation of stations on the Zhengtai Railway in recent days, the local authorities officially raised the issue at 10:30 AM on the 6th during a regular meeting of the three-party representatives of the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters. It is reported that the Executive Headquarters has handed the matter over to the representatives of the commanders of both sides for direct discussion. However, the representatives of the commanders of both sides did not convene a meeting again today. Furthermore, according to reporters, the Executive Headquarters has scheduled a joint meeting of the representatives of both sides at 10:30 AM on the 8th, at which time they will hear the progress of the direct discussions between the two sides in recent days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 7th] "Peace talks have been ineffective, concluding with the Communist Party failing to keep its promises. Today, the Communist Party's rhetoric of comprehensive ceasefire, local ceasefire, and reorganization of the government—if the Communist Party guarantees not to break its promises again, I can still represent the government and sign an agreement with them." This was declared by Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng at his first press conference in Guling at 5:30 PM on the 7th. Chief of General Staff Chen gave detailed answers to questions jointly raised by reporters in Guling today. Regarding peace talks, in addition to declaring the aforementioned opinions, the Chief also stated that withdrawing from Northern Jiangsu, implementing military reorganization, and restoring transportation remain the urgent themes to be realized in the continuing peace talks. He first gave a general overview of the military situation in Northern Jiangsu. To prevent further attacks, the National army on the Yangzhou-Hai'an line, after defensive adjustments, still strictly adheres to orders, not counterattacking unless attacked, and not attacking proactively. However, the Communist army has been slow to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu to the area north of the Longhai Railway, posing a great threat to Nanjing and Shanghai. In my meeting with the Communist Party representatives, I offered three plans for the Northern Jiangsu issue: the best plan was for the Communist army to withdraw, the middle plan was for the National Government to relocate the capital, and the worst plan was for an armed showdown. The Communist army was unwilling to implement the best plan, and the National Government had just returned the capital in May, so it was inconvenient to relocate again. As a result, they resorted to the worst plan, but did not go all the way, with only the Communist army hitting people and the National army being hit, without a real showdown. According to air force inspection reports, the Communist army has breached the dikes of the Yunshu Rivers in Northern Jiangsu, resulting in five areas in Northern Jiangsu becoming a vast expanse of water. Many people are climbing tree roots and rooftops to escape, a tragic sight to behold. A reporter asked: "Then the government is just watching without helping?" Chief Chen replied with a smile: "I will respect democracy and ask you all to discuss this." He continued: "I have spent half my life in the military, and I did not seek the limelight during the eight years of the War of Resistance, so why would I want to fight my own people to seek the limelight? Even from my perspective as Chief of General Staff, if a war really breaks out, the logistics, ammunition, medical treatment, and bereavement compensation will all be endless troubles, and my physical strength will be difficult to handle. The so-called 'war is dangerous' is not just the wishful thinking of anti-war activists. Therefore, in order to remove the threat to Nanjing and Shanghai and to save the people of Northern Jiangsu, the government will spare no effort to do its utmost to urge the Communist Party to comply with the order to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and retreat to the area north of the Longhai Railway. As for the implementation of military reorganization, it is a necessary path for building the army and building the nation, and restoring transportation is a prerequisite for production and construction. The Communist Party must also earnestly fulfill its promises."</p>
<p>A reporter asked if there was a proposal for the Communist army to breach the five dams of the Grand Canal. Chief Chen replied that Mr. Zhou Enlai had submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan stating that the Grand Canal was flooded and requesting the opening of the five dams of the Grand Canal. He believed that since both the Yangtze River and Hongze Lake were rising, whether opening the five dams of the Grand Canal could accommodate its discharge flow should be jointly investigated by both sides and experts. Chief Chen also said that he and Mr. Zhou Enlai have a very close personal relationship and never make offensive slanders. The Communist army's dike-breaking in Northern Jiangsu and harming the people was probably something that Mr. Enlai could not foresee, nor could he end. In other words, whether Mr. Enlai's words and deeds today can represent the entire Communist Party and whether they can be kept by the Communist Party is highly questionable.</p>
<p>After Chief Chen finished this answer, he answered many more questions from reporters: (Question) Can you tell us the content of your meeting with Marshal Ma today? (Answer) Marshal Ma was very happy about the progress of the government's military reorganization. I told him that 59 divisions have been reorganized. As for the other topic we discussed, I know you all did not expect it, and even I did not expect it. Marshal Ma inquired in great detail about film education. (Question) What is the significance of the Communist Party's anti-Americanism? (Answer) Speaking in my personal capacity, the Communist Party created an Anping Incident similar in nature to the Boxer Rebellion to oppose the United States, which not only loses the personality of the Chinese people but also does not understand the principles of being human. The Communist Party seeks help from others on the one hand and hurts them on the other, contradicting itself and going back on its word, which I cannot agree with. (Question) Is there any progress in the investigation of the Li-Wen case? (Answer) I dare to say that this case was not committed by senior intellectuals. After the case is solved in the future, no matter who the main culprit is, the government will severely punish them.</p>
<p>Chief Chen felt very happy and relaxed at today's press conference. The Director of the Ministry of National Defense's Information Bureau was also present, and abundant refreshments were prepared.</p>

According to regulations, the living allowance for central civil servants and teachers is adjusted every three months. The last revision was in June, and the next adjustment should have been in September.

The case was originally scheduled to be announced on the 6th, but as of the time of the telegram, it had not yet been announced. It is speculated by the general public that since Liang and Zhou have already arrived in Kunming, the announcement of the case may be postponed for a day or two.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Special Envoy Marshall will rush back to Nanjing from Guling before noon tomorrow. It is reported that Marshal Ma will conduct an in-depth study of current issues with Ambassador Stuart, and this important meeting may find a new path for the KMT-CPC negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 7th] Chief Chen Cheng visited Marshal Marshall at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 7th, and they talked under the shade of the trees in the residence, with Pi Zonggan translating, for one hour and twenty-five minutes before parting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] After Ambassador Stuart had a five-hour-long talk with Zhou Enlai last night, there was no activity today. In the morning, Ambassador Stuart paid a courtesy call on the Mexican Ambassador. In the afternoon, he received Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation for half an hour, and then hosted foreign reporters at 5:30 PM. It is reported that Military Council President Long Yun will visit tomorrow morning. According to sources, the Anping Incident was an important topic in yesterday's meeting between Stuart and Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai expressed that it was an unfortunate incident and only made a forced explanation. However, Ambassador Stuart is currently waiting quietly for the reaction of American public opinion and does not want to affect the peace talks between the KMT and the CPC due to official matters. With the devout psychology of a religious believer, Ambassador Stuart always prays for the light that may return soon. Also, regarding the reorganization of the government, the government is currently considering it in light of the current situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Ambassador Stuart Leighton had a five-hour-long talk with CPC representative Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 6th. According to sources close to the Ambassador, yesterday's talk mostly revisited old issues and reviewed and exchanged views on issues related to the political consultation meeting, such as the cessation of military conflicts, the resumption of transportation, and the reorganization of the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] According to an authoritative source, the Communist side has repeatedly made harsh demands, which have been rejected by the government. Recently, the government has also reportedly put forward a new opinion on the issues of troop reduction and garrison areas, which have not yielded results in the past negotiations. However, the Communist Party insisted on its established policy and refused to accept it, so judging from the current situation, it has indeed reached a deadlock and there is no possibility of negotiation. As for the Communist Party's repeated emphasis on the withdrawal of American troops, informed sources believe that even if all American troops in China were to withdraw, it would not have any impact on the current situation. Furthermore, American officials are unwilling to turn the issue between the KMT and the CPC into a Sino-American relations issue. It is reported that Ambassador Stuart, in addition to reporting to the U.S. State Department to prevent the situation from escalating, is currently waiting quietly for instructions from the White House to make a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Eight Warships Carrying Private Goods: All Malicious Rumors <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by the Minister of Navy</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the rumors that the eight new warships returning from the United States carried private goods such as cars, and that senior officials were punished as a result, Chief of Staff Zhou Xianzhang of the Naval Headquarters told reporters on the 7th that since a certain newspaper in Shanghai published malicious news on the 29th of last month, various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai have also published intermittent reports. Cars are not small items, and the eight warships are not very large. They are all combat vessels and there is no room for cars in the cabins. If there were cars, they would have to be placed on the deck. Hours before the eight warships arrived in Nanjing, people and reporters were waiting at the dock. After the eight warships were berthed, reporters and people rushed to the eight warships in small boats. For half a month, officials and reporters from the central military and political organs have also visited. May I ask, who has seen cars placed on the ships? The Nanjing Municipal Government has registered all the car licenses in the city. Please check with the Municipal Government to see if any new cars have been registered recently. The matter of carrying private goods is also groundless. As for being assigned to the Shanghai Fleet Command, it is a return to the Chinese organization. Commander Lin Zun was our naval attache in the United States. This mission was to lead the eight warships back to China. Now that the eight warships have arrived in the capital, his mission is over and he will soon return to his original position. No one on the eight warships has been detained. The headquarters must distribute these new talents to the entire army in order to enrich it, so there are personnel transfers for both officers and soldiers, not just a few people.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Anping Incident Investigation Procedure: US and Communist Sides Clash Fiercely; Government Representatives of the Executive Headquarters Mediate <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The special team dispatched by the Executive Headquarters to investigate the Anping Incident is still stranded on the beach of investigation procedures. The reason is that the Communist Party advocated that the team should first go to the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters for investigation, then to the Communist Party's Jidong Military Region headquarters, and finally to the accident site, Anping Daxiaosha River for investigation. The U.S. side advocated going directly to the accident site without going to the Marine Corps headquarters and the Jidong Military Region headquarters. The two sides argued fiercely over this, causing them to slam the table. In this dispute, the government representatives are acting as mediators. Although this special team has repeatedly heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs, it has not yet come downstairs, but it has changed representatives several times. The current government representative has been replaced by Major General Zhang Shuheng, and the U.S. representative has been replaced by Davis, which shows how difficult it is for the team to depart.</p>

<p>[Tianjin Dispatch from the United States Information Service, 7th] Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram to Major General Rockey, Commander of the First Marine Division of the United States Navy, expressing his deep sympathy and regret for the comrades who were killed and wounded in the recent Anping ambush. He also conveyed his condolences to the Marine Corps and the families of the deceased and wounded.</p>
<h3 id="e16">After the Anping Incident: A Glimpse of American Public Opinion; Both Moderates and Liberals Oppose Troop Withdrawal, Advocating Full Effort to Promote Stability in China <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Washington, 7th] After the Anping Incident, American public opinion remained relatively calm. Since the State Department spokesperson announced on the 5th that there was no change in the American policy towards China, the New York Herald Tribune and the Washington Post have both published editorials supporting the continued stationing of American troops in China. They stated that once American troops withdraw, China will inevitably become more chaotic. While American troops should not be used to participate in China's "civil war," their presence can, to some extent, encourage China to work towards expanding the government and allowing liberal elements to participate in the political power. The reporter observed that American public opinion, while not in favor of changing the policy towards China, demands that the government further clarify its policy to make it more transparent and not easily misunderstood. In general, American newspapers and radio commentators have differing opinions on the China issue. Some oppose the Communist Party, some oppose the Nationalist Party, some advocate that the United States should always mediate the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists, and some advocate that the United States should completely withdraw from China. For example: (1) The moderates, represented by the New York Times, believe that the Nationalist Government is the only legitimate government in China, so the United States should fully support the Nationalist Government to create a peaceful and stable situation, so that it can shoulder the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Far East. (2) The liberals, represented by the New York Herald Tribune, advocate that the United States should use its full strength to help China establish a "coalition government," so that liberal elements inside and outside the Nationalist Party have the opportunity to grasp political power. (3) The Scripps-Howard newspaper group insists that the United States should not be intimidated into withdrawing and abandoning the China issue, leaving it to the Soviet Union to use the Communist Party to dominate China, thereby endangering the peace of the entire Pacific region. (4) The American Communist Party and its fellow travelers, such as the Daily Worker, representing the furthest left line, denigrate the Nationalist Government as a "corrupt regime," so American troops should withdraw as soon as possible, and aid to China should be stopped as soon as possible, to promote the collapse of the Nationalist Government and facilitate the Communist Party's takeover. (5) Representing the furthest right line, such as anti-communist religious figures, the Hearst newspaper group, which is known for its exclusive anti-Soviet and anti-communist commentaries, and isolationist and nationalist newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News, on the one hand, loudly advocate anti-Soviet rhetoric, and on the other hand, advocate that the United States should close itself off and not interfere in the affairs of other countries. From this, it can be seen that the extreme left and right wings both advocate withdrawing American troops, while the moderate and liberal centrists all oppose troop withdrawal. Most noteworthy is that the reports of American newspapers and news agencies' correspondents in China often influence the opinions of some Americans. Our government and all sectors of society should provide them with ample information at all times, so that they can report the truth of the Chinese political situation and the genuine hopes of the people to the American government and public. Among American newspapers with influential power, the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune are currently the most important. The latter believes that the CCP will encounter military failure and be forced to adopt guerrilla warfare. If the Nationalist Party can earnestly implement the various reform promises it has made in its previous declarations and resolutions, it will be more successful in eliminating the threat of Chinese communism than military force. The American Policy Association on China, is also an organization recently launched by people in the United States who are deeply knowledgeable about the situation in China. They do not agree with the American government's excessive elevation of the status of the CCP, and the forced acceptance of the Communist Party's conditions by the Nationalist Government for unlimited concessions. Its sponsors include William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, and Ernest J. King, former chairman of the US Red Cross in China, among others.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Government Decides to Send Planes to Carry Foreign Reporters to Inspect the Truth of the Communist Army Breaching Dykes; Minister Bai Reports on the Current Situation on Various Fronts <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] In response to the request of foreign reporters, Minister Peng of the Propaganda Department and Minister Bai of the National Defense Department will prepare a special plane to carry the reporters to inspect the area above the Su-Bei and An-Bei regions where the Communist army destroyed river dykes and caused floods. This move is scheduled to be realized on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu and Henan-Hubei Borders</p>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on the current military situation in various regions at a reception for foreign reporters in the Central Propaganda Department today. According to reports, since the recovery of Rugao, Tianchang, and Xuyi along the Jinpu Railway in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army's offensive has been thwarted. Taking advantage of the summer floods of the Yellow River and Huai River, they breached the dykes in the area north of Huaiyin on the Longhai Railway in four places. This vast expanse of water, in addition to trapping millions of people in deep water away from their homes, has also affected the Communist army's offensive disruption and the National Army's movements. As a result, the lines in Northern Jiangsu have been slightly eased. As for the Henan-Hubei border area, Li Xiannian's troops, numbering over 50,000, were divided into four groups a month ago and attempted to flee to western Henan and southern Shaanxi. However, because the local militia system in western Henan has always been known to be sound, the Communist army was unable to occupy any towns. After being intercepted by the militia, most of these 50,000 troops were dispersed or captured, leaving only over 7,000. Among them, 1,500 were led by Li Xiannian and are now fleeing to the Shanyang County area of the Qinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Situation in Northeast China</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Northeast China, Minister Bai stated that the Northeast has been quiet for a long time since the ceasefire. After the Communist army's failures in the three major battles of Shanhaiguan, Benxihu, and Sipingjie, it realized its weak strength. On the one hand, it organized the masses to step up training, and on the other hand, it transported troops from Shandong to expand its power. Therefore, when Chief Du Jianming invited Lin Biao to meet last time, Lin only sent Li Lisan as a representative, bringing harsh conditions that the government could not consider, preventing the negotiations from achieving any success, in order to delay and achieve the above-mentioned attempt. However, the Northeast region is extremely rich and the people can live and work in peace and contentment, so communist ideology is really difficult to have any effect.</p>
<p>Communist Conspiracy</p>
<p>Regarding the incident in which the National Army sent a plane to bomb the plane detained by the defense army in the suburbs of Yan'an, it did not cause any loss of life or property to the people, so this is not a matter of concern. As for the ambush on American naval personnel in Anping, it was a premeditated strategy by the Communist Party to confuse American public opinion and force the American government to withdraw American troops stationed in China. The unprovoked attack on the American Navy is the same as the attacks on the National Army in various places. This clearly points out that the Communist Party has no intention of peaceful negotiations. The continuation and success of the negotiations have suffered greatly from this atrocity. We are very pleased to read the statement of the spokesperson of the United States Department of State on August 5, because this statement proves that the United States government has accurate information on the Chinese situation and is not confused.</p>
<p>Communist Excuse</p>
<p>New York Times reporter Lippmann asked whether it was true that the Communist Party launched an offensive in Northern Jiangsu on July 10, claiming that the government had planned a fierce attack in Northern Jiangsu, so they took preemptive action. Minister Bai replied: This is completely untrue. The Communist Party's statement is actually a far-fetched excuse. The government has never planned to attack the Communist army, but in order to protect the people and maintain social order, the government cannot but take effective actions to curb the Communist army's attacks.</p>
<p>Adjusting Salaries</p>
<p>According to Minister Peng's announcement at a reception for foreign reporters, the government decided this morning to adjust the salaries of civil servants by more than 50%. The reasons for this automatic and early adjustment are: First, there has been no increase in legal tender in July of this year, which is an unprecedented phenomenon since the War of Resistance, indicating that the country's finances have become increasingly sound; Second, in addition to the general decline in the price of imported goods in recent times, the price of food in various provinces has generally fallen due to the autumn harvest, so raising salaries will not affect prices. Although this increase cannot solve the salary problem of civil servants, it can also show that the lives of civil servants are always of concern to the government authorities.</p>

<p>[Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 7th] A reporter recently interviewed Minister of Communications Yu Dawei regarding the postal rate increase. According to reports, the postal service incurs losses of more than four billion yuan per month, all of which are subsidized by the national treasury.

<h3 id="e22">Hankou Direct Tax Bureau Discovers Major Embezzlement Case by Tax Collectors; Colluding with Presidents of Various Guilds to Impose Additional Handling Fees; Managers of Related Businesses Handed Over to Court for Investigation <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Hankou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 6th] The Hankou Direct Tax Bureau recently discovered a major embezzlement case in which tax collectors imposed additional "handling fees," collecting a total of more than 100 million yuan in illicit gains by charging an additional 20% handling fee on business tax. In order to simplify procedures and save time, the bureau stipulated that various trade guilds should submit collective declarations for business tax collection. The original intention was not to be faulted, but mid-level staff and tax collectors of the bureau took this opportunity to collude with the presidents of various guilds to collect handling fees under false pretenses. Huang You, section chief of the bureau's business section, discovered factual evidence, and the case was revealed layer by layer. The managers of Changchang Ginseng Shop and Sichuan Silver Ear Shop involved in the case have been handed over to the court for investigation, and other victims are also secretly reporting. According to general analysis, the most suspected masterminds of the case are Du Ban Hui Hongzhi and Business Section Chief Yang Ziduo of the bureau. Hui has denied it, while Yang has applied for resignation and returned more than one million yuan in handling fees collected from the ginseng industry guild to the guild. Afterwards, the local newspapers criticized Xu Zhifan, the director of the bureau. Xu replied, "The embezzlement was discovered by my investigation, but the newspapers revealed it too early, causing both the givers and receivers of bribes to fear crime and shirk their responsibilities, making it difficult for me to deal with. Reporters are too terrible." His words seemed full of frustration.</p>

<p>Jiangyin: Searching for Communist Troops on the Chengwu Border</p>
<p>Near the intersection of Chengwu, in the areas of Liulu, Dongqing, Xinan, and Licheng, there are scattered Communist troops from Southern Jiangsu. Most of them are natives who withdrew north last year. Together with new recruits, they are very familiar with the local situation. They are divided into groups of dozens of people, lurking in the countryside. Liu Kaisheng, the chief of the second section of the Wujin Army, believes that "nurturing evil will cause a prairie fire." For a thorough plan, he has joined forces with the pacification inspection team of the First Pacification Headquarters, the Joint Defense Committee of Chengxiwu, and the border self-defense teams to search the rural areas of Chengwu for days. Starting from Hengshan Bridge, they advanced in separate routes and searched extensively after passing through Xin'an Shiyan. The leaders of these small groups are Wu Xian, a former resident of Zhou Zun Village in Xixiang, Jiangyin, who once served as the puppet county magistrate of Danyang, and Li Shunzhi (from Licheng). They lead about two machine guns and more than thirty long and short rifles. The cadres are Zheng Qin, Zhang Beisheng, Liu Beiqian, Chen Yuanda, etc., who are rampant in various villages. The authorities have been paying close attention.</p>
<p>Changshu: Investigating the Crimes of Traitorous Father and Sons</p>
<p>Ge Qinan, Ge Zhongyuan, and Ge Bofang, residents of Cangheyan, Yingchun Bridge, outside Xiaodongmen, a family of three father and sons, all served as staff members of the puppet field tax collection office and interpreters for the Luantian Bing Three Brigade during the War of Resistance. After the victory, they were arrested and imprisoned by the authorities on charges of treason. The Jiangsu High Court is examining their crimes. Now, Ma has confirmed the crimes and ordered the local court here to notify the township office to assist in the investigation within three days in order to make a ruling.</p>
<p>Suzhou:</p>
<p>Robbery Failed, Bandit Killed</p>
<p>Yang Yanbin, the rebel general claiming to be the commander-in-chief of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army" entrenched in Taihu Lake, relied on the notorious bandit Liu Hualong as his helper. Liu hid on the shore of East Taihu Lake and often fled to rural areas around Yunze, Nanxun, and Huzhou. Recently, the Wujiang County Government discovered his whereabouts and arrested him at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the end of July. The Wujiang County Government sent armed police to Yindi, and at around 6 p.m. on the afternoon of the third, when they were passing near the Bailong Bridge, about two miles away from Bacan Town, they were suddenly encountered by more than 20 bandits who fired to stop the prisoner. The police and bandits engaged in a fierce battle lasting 30 minutes. Fortunately, the Bacan Town Self-Defense Team heard the alarm and rushed to support them, and the bandits began to falter and fled towards Taihu Lake. During the chaos, the notorious bandit Liu Hualong secretly tried to escape by crossing the shore, but was killed by stray bullets. The Wujiang County Government has now dispatched strong forces to search for the bandits around Bacan. Liu's death is tantamount to a major blow to Yang Yanbin.</p>
<p>Water Police Patrol Taihu Lake: Zhang Shaohua, the captain of the Second Detachment of Water Police, felt that the Taihu Lake, in his jurisdiction, was full of lake bandits, and that travelers viewed it with fear. So Zhang personally led his First Brigade on the 4th, equipped with machine guns and small cannons, and patrolled from Suzhou to Taihu Lake by motorboat. He arrived in Wuxi that night, and on the 5th he went to Wujin. He is scheduled to go to the key points of Taihu Lake such as Yixing and Heqiao on the 6th, and is scheduled to return to Suzhou on the 8th.</p>

<p>Kidnapping, Murder, and Destruction of Evidence</p>
<p>On the evening of the 27th of last month, more than a dozen people claiming to be members of the self-defense team from the western temple of Dangko Town, brought weapons and kidnapped Zhao Zhicheng (from Taixing), a friend of the abbot monk Jue Wu, and has not been heard from since. There is a lot of talk in the countryside, saying that after Zhao Zhicheng was arrested, he was first tortured in private and seriously injured, making him unable to move. Afterwards, he was killed, his body cut into several pieces, placed in an oil drum, and buried in a desolate tomb that night to destroy the evidence. The villagers said it with certainty. Zhao's wife, Xu, is from Jiangyin. On the 5th, she cried to the Jiangyin Township Association, recounting the details of Zhao Zhicheng's murder, and asked for justice. After receiving the report, the association decided to organize a Zhao case support committee to appeal for justice, in order to maintain humanity. It is heard that the members of the town's self-defense team are mixed, mostly former enemies and traitors. Li Zhanze, the captain of the county's security brigade, has sent staff to the countryside to investigate, and has scheduled to go to the countryside himself on the 12th to investigate the truth, so that he can pursue the case.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e26">America's China Policy Remains Unchanged <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. State Department spokesperson stated on the 5th of this month that the current U.S. policy toward China remains the same as announced by Acting Secretary of State Acheson on June 28th, with no changes. It was also stated that rumors from Nanjing that the U.S. President had instructed the planning of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China are incorrect. This is a very important statement.</p>
<p>Since the "unfortunate incident" in Anping occurred, it has been widely rumored that the U.S. policy towards China would change. On the one hand, the Chinese Communists admitted that the Anping incident was a "regret," but on the other hand, they protested to the U.S. military, saying that the fundamental solution lies in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Needless to say, friends intoxicated by Communist propaganda, whether in China or in the United States, would echo and advocate that the United States change its policy toward China, withdraw its troops from China, and no longer interfere in China's affairs. It seems that the Communist Party's plan for "expelling American influence from China," which has been planned for half a year, is about to mature and can be achieved as they wish. Now, after the solemn statement by the spokesperson of the U.S. State Department, the situation has been clarified.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can see that the American government and public are feeling troubled by the China issue. However, we dare to frankly point out to our American allies that the United States fought alongside China during the war and has been assisting China in its efforts for peaceful unification after the war, hoping that China can become a unified, democratic, and strong country, and that it can undertake the task of a member of the United Nations in the Far East and jointly maintain world peace. Our Chinese government and people, no matter what, will definitely strive towards this goal and will never let themselves down, let alone the good intentions of the United States and other allied countries. China is currently in a transitional period, learning democracy, and moving towards the road of democratic politics. Unfortunately, there is an armed Communist Party that still relies on its armed forces and is unwilling to follow the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, as well as the plans to stop conflicts, restore transportation, and reorganize the army, so that the situation of peaceful unification still has to wait for a considerable period. However, as seen by Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, as long as we "do not let abnormal conditions affect normal conditions" and everyone is not stimulated by the "Anping Incident" and continues to strive towards the original goal, we still believe that the overall situation in China is hopeful.</p>
<p>World peace is indivisible, and the United States can no longer be isolated! This is a well-known trend in the world, and it is also the common understanding of enlightened people in the American government and the public. Secretary of State Byrnes recently made such a clear announcement. Therefore, the United States cannot stand by and watch the overall situation in China; however, precisely because of this, the United States is deeply concerned that Marshal Marshall's efforts for more than half a year have not been able to fully achieve its mission. Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles's remarks on July 28th frankly pointed out the reason why the Chinese Communist leaders refuse to agree to adopt an equal and constructive solution to their disputes with the central government; this is precisely the focus of the United States' real concern. Generally speaking, the views of American public opinion on the China issue, just as reported in this newspaper's Washington dispatch yesterday, are also quite inconsistent. Some oppose the Communist Party, some oppose the Kuomintang, some advocate that the United States should always mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and some advocate that the United States should completely withdraw from China as soon as possible. We deeply know that the American government and the public have an expectation for China, that it will unify, democratize, and become strong as soon as possible, which is entirely out of good intentions. Therefore, no matter what their views are, it is just that their opinions may differ, and they do not harbor any ill will towards China. In any case, we Chinese journalists have an obligation to make the United States truly understand the situation in China. We dare to say that wars in the world often arise from international estrangement, and international estrangement is partly due to the provocations of some warmongers and partly due to the incomplete and inaccurate news reports between countries, as well as the failure to fully exchange genuine public opinion. Therefore, under the major premise that we firmly believe that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, we still believe that Chinese intellectuals, whether they are journalists, educators, or entrepreneurs, should frankly and candidly provide their legitimate opinions on national affairs at this time to help the United States and other allied countries understand the situation in China.</p>
<p>Our opinion, simply put, has only the following points: (1) China needs unity and even more peace. Only under the situation of unity and peace can China embark on the road to democracy and strength, can the national strength and people's livelihood be restored, and can it truly fulfill the tasks that a member of the United Nations should bear. We believe that the Chinese people's hope is very clear to the authorities of the National Government, and since the Japanese surrendered, the National Government has indeed been working towards this goal. The rumors that there are some reactionary elements or stubborn factions in the Kuomintang colluding with reactionary elements in the United States to obstruct peaceful unification, we believe, are a consistent trick of the Communist Party's distorted propaganda for many years and are by no means facts. The Kuomintang's nation-building plan is divided into three stages: military administration, tutelage administration, and constitutional administration, and today's procedure has reached the stage of transitioning from tutelage administration to constitutional administration. The Kuomintang has never advocated "one-party dictatorship" to the end, and today it has no intention of excluding other parties. Just look at the National Government's first accommodating of non-partisan and non-factional virtuous people, as well as its eager hope to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible to return power to the people, and you can know the absurdity of the saying that the stubborn faction is hindering democracy.</p>
<p>(2) The success of China's peaceful unification cannot be achieved by unilateral efforts. The National Government certainly hopes for peaceful unification, but what about the armed Communist Party? People often like to compare China with France, thinking about how France united after the war and how it jumped to become the balancing power in Europe, and then sighed at China's lack of ambition. However, we must recall an article by Powell published by the China Weekly Review not long after the Japanese surrendered last year, that China has something different from the situation in France. France does not have an armed Communist Party, this is one. The French Communist Party is willing to engage in political competition in a peaceful environment, rather than relying on guerrillas or underground troops, and openly raise the banner of rebellion, this is two. France is one of the four powers jointly occupying Germany, and France's border is not connected to the territory of the Soviet Union, and there has been no incident like the independence of Outer Mongolia and the events in Xinjiang and the Northeast, this is three. In short, China and France are in different situations, and the Chinese government, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance and Friendship Treaty, has been willing to abide by the treaty at all times and in all places, and become an allied country with the Soviet Union that gets along friendly for thirty years, especially willing to become a bridge in the Far East issue for the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly maintain world peace. This is an obvious fact, but in order to achieve this noble task, the Communist Party must take into account the position of the country and the nation, implement the plan of reorganization and unified compilation, completely hand over the army to the country, and turn itself into an ordinary political party, and then China can truly shoulder this task. If this cannot be done, and the Communist Party still has different intentions everywhere, and always wants to create a divided and turbulent China, then whose responsibility it is that China cannot achieve peaceful unification soon is self-evident.</p>
<p>(3) Before the Communist Party changes its attitude, we predict that the Communist Party's opposition to the National Government, and even the opposition to the United States, will emerge endlessly. And the United States, being stimulated by it, will make a big mistake if it withdraws its troops. The Communist Party originally hoped that, due to its distorted propaganda, it might cause the United States to exert extreme pressure on the National Government to accept all the Communist Party's unreasonable demands. Therefore, when Marshal Marshall came to China, he was called the "angel of peace," and when Ambassador Stuart announced his new appointment, he also expressed an unusually welcome. But once it feels that the U.S. policy toward China is fair and impartial, it opposes the U.S. representative's arbitration power, it kidnaps the American soldiers in Tianjin, it attacks the U.S. Marines passing through Anping, it shouts loudly that American reactionary elements are helping China's "civil war," and it everywhere advocates that the United States must withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible. In other words, if the United States can help the Communist Party, the Communist Party will welcome it; conversely, if the United States is fair and impartial, the Communist Party will be anti-American. They hope that after the U.S. troops withdraw, they can start their "full-scale rebellion" in the Northeast, North China, and even the whole of China, and China may become a divided situation. Just look at the siege of Datong in Shanxi these days, the turmoil in Rehe, and the editorial in the Huazhong Xinhua Daily in Huaiyin inciting a full-scale guerrilla war, and you can get a glimpse of the Communist Party's attempt. Therefore, the editorials of the New York Herald Tribune and the Washington Post on the 6th pointed out that the reason why the U.S. troops stationed in China cannot withdraw at this time is to prevent China's political, military, and economic chaos and to prevent the cutting off of various transportation lines, which is indeed a pertinent remark.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that China does need peace, and the first thing is naturally to prevent the war fabricated by the current Communist Party from expanding. The stationing of U.S. troops in China can assist China in completing this task. We certainly do not hope that U.S. troops will be stationed in China permanently, and especially do not want to implicate the United States for a long time because of China's problems, but at this time, the U.S. troops stationed in China still have the task of assisting China in repatriating enemy prisoners of war and refugees, and restoring peace and order. For the sake of China's peace and for the sake of world peace, we agree that the United States should implement its fair and constructive policy towards China.</p>
<h3 id="e27">First Father's Day After Victory <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>China's Father's Day did not start today; but today is the first Father's Day after victory, an important day from the birth of Father's Day to its adoption by various countries in the world. Recalling China's Father's Day, it actually started on August 8th, 1945, initiated by ten leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, including Yan Huisheng and Yuan Xilian. At that time, it was during the final battle in the Far East, and the enemy bandits were rampant, and the environment was dangerous. The initiation of this Father's Day was actually an implication of remembrance and national awakening; therefore, the leaders ascended and called out, and the masses responded. At that time, there was a warm Father's Day celebration in Shanghai. Later, celebrities from all walks of life, such as Pan Gongzhan, Li Shizeng, and Song Hanzhang, believed that the holding of Father's Day was a pure expression of national righteousness during the Anti-Japanese War and that it was necessary to promote it. Therefore, they submitted a request to the municipal authorities to forward it to the central government, requesting that August 8th be designated as Father's Day and that it be promulgated to the whole country for compliance. The sentence in their submission read: "...The initiation of Father's Day is purely a pure expression of national consciousness during the Anti-Japanese War, which is not incompatible with the Mother's Day initiated by the United States after the First European War, and complements each other, for the sake of commemorating the history of the Anti-Japanese War, and for the sake of accumulating national morality, it should be clearly stipulated by the central government and permanently designated as a holiday." Now, we have come across this Father's Day with profound significance again. Although the central government's explicit order has not yet arrived, the people's feelings for this Father's Day that commemorates the grace of the father are even more joyful. Although the launch of this Father's Day was in Shanghai, because of its profound significance, it is believed that the people of the whole country will definitely rise up in response, and the people of other parts of the world will also follow suit and commemorate Father's Day with enthusiasm, so as to shine after the Mother's Day initiated after the First World War and promote the lofty love of mankind.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the Chinese people, there is nothing better than the holding of Father's Day to leave a permanent memorial for our eight-year long struggle. War is an ominous event. The construction of a state by two countries is not necessarily the intention of all the people. China has been invaded by Japanese warlords for the longest time and has suffered the most severely, but we cannot use this to think that all the Japanese people harbor the intention of invading China; among them, how can there not also be those who are intimidated by the power of the warlords, so they provide service to the warlords. If we want to leave a permanent memorial for this Sino-Japanese war, we must make this memorial acceptable to both the Chinese and Japanese people. In our eight years of struggle, there is no shortage of heroic days that can leave a permanent memorial for our national war; but only the holding of this Father's Day can grasp the feelings of the Chinese people and the feelings of the Japanese people and become a holiday that can be commemorated by both the Chinese and Japanese people. Chinese people have fathers, and Japanese people also have fathers; Father's Day was born during the Sino-Japanese War, so that the Chinese people can associate it with the suffering they encountered during the Anti-Japanese War, and the Japanese people can associate it with how they were used by the warlords to launch the invasion of China, which led to today's defeat. The holding of this holiday should enable the people of China and Japan to have a deeper understanding; therefore, it is most appropriate for us to use Father's Day as a memorial for our eight-year long struggle.</p>
<p>However, the holding of Father's Day is naturally not entirely to commemorate the Anti-Japanese War; it also has the supreme intention of carrying forward and developing our country's inherent virtues. Since "Down with the Confucian Shop" and the advocacy of "anti-filial piety," our country's inherent ethics and morality have been frequently attacked, resulting in a gradual decline in the moral standards of our people. The reason why a country stands, ultimately, must rely on morality to maintain it. Although Western Europe and other parts of the Soviet Union do not have an ethical system like ours, their people are deeply influenced by Christianity, and the doctrines of Christianity are very close to our traditional ethical concepts. The "love" spoken of in Christianity originally includes our "filial piety." "Filial piety" and "love" are essentially two in one. Western European countries, their material civilization is extremely developed, if there is no spiritual civilization of Christianity to serve as their backbone, I really don't know what kind of world it will become. Our long-term Anti-Japanese War has now ended, and the country is advancing on the road to nation-building. At this time, we should especially restore our country's inherent and good traditional morality, so that our nation-building cause can have a good spiritual foundation. In the effort to restore our country's inherent morality, the holding of this Father's Day will undoubtedly benefit the world and people's hearts. The establishment of customs can refresh the people's ears and eyes, and express our country's traditional virtues with a new attitude and a new style.</p>
<p>The reason why Father's Day is set on August 8th is not only because the eight-eight connection is shaped like the character "father," and the sound is also similar to the word "dad," but there may be another profound meaning here. The weather in August is in the middle of summer, with the scorching sun in the sky. Parents sweat all day long and work hard tirelessly, originally hoping for their children; and for the children, in the long and hot summer, if they think of the hard work of their parents, they should think more about the way to repay them. August is the end and the beginning of the academic year, and in the blink of an eye, it will be cool in the autumn, and the students will be entering school one after another. At this time, when we commemorate our father, and think about how to repay him, there is nothing better than the donation of scholarships. Helping others to become talented is the greatest joy. At the same time as the holding of the first Father's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it is also planned to hold the solicitation of scholarships. We hope that the "filial piety" can enthusiastically donate, which is the best way to commemorate the father and repay his deep grace.</p>
<p>Finally, because we have the holding of Father's Day, we hope that our spirit can inspire people in Western Europe and other countries to also have the holding of Father's Day on the same day. The launch of Mother's Day was after the First World War. Now that the Second World War is over, there are many fathers in the world who cannot see their beloved children, and there are many children who cannot see their kind father return. They may be on a deserted island in the Pacific, in a desert in Africa, or in remote places, with tombs facing the Xiaofeng Canyue. We want to commemorate them. It is because of their death that we have our lives. This Father's Day was launched in China, which has been most deeply harmed by aggression. This is a gift from the Chinese people to repay the help of the allied countries; we hope that after this, the second and third generations and even the fathers of later generations can be spared the encounters that our generation has encountered.</p>

Mr. Byrnes stated: "Please have the Secretariat extend invitations to the five former enemy states - Holland, Romania, Italy, Bulgaria, and Finland - to attend the peace conference, so that they may present their views in the plenary session. This invitation was pre-determined by the Council of Foreign Ministers." Soviet representative Vyshinsky believed Mr. Byrnes' proposal was reasonable, but added that each former enemy state should not only be allowed to express its views in the plenary session, but also be allowed to attend the subcommittees, and this should be stipulated. Mr. Byrnes readily accepted the supplementary proposal. British Under-Secretary of State McNeil advocated that the invitation should be issued by the entire Regulations Committee, not just by one member state; Mr. Byrnes also agreed. The US proposal was unanimously passed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Emergency Broadcast): The Yugoslavian representative has requested permission for Albania to participate in the peace conference. Also, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi led a delegation to Paris today. A memorandum from the delegation regarding the Franco-Italian border issue was submitted to the peace conference this morning.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Emergency Broadcast): Regulations Committee Chairman Spaak has announced that the amendment concerning voting procedures has been unanimously adopted by the committee.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): During the Regulations Committee meeting this afternoon, the amendment proposed by Yugoslavia encountered no opposition, which surprised Chairman Spaak. Yugoslavia proposed that any proposal from a relevant country that is not adopted within the peace conference could be directly submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers. This amendment has now been unanimously passed by the committee.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): During today's peace conference meeting, Australian representative Evatt expressed his willingness to withdraw the Australian amendment to the voting procedure. Dutch representative Stikker also made a similar declaration. British Under-Secretary of State McNeil immediately congratulated Chairman Spaak on his successful promotion of compromise. The atmosphere in the meeting hall became more relaxed, and the representatives fully demonstrated their great spirit of compromise.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 7th) The Regulations Committee held three night meetings yesterday, with the final meeting ending at 2:30 AM the following morning. The British amendment to the peace conference voting rules was passed by a vote of fifteen to six. The amendment stipulated that peace conference proposals would be divided into two categories: one category requiring a simple majority to pass, and the other requiring a two-thirds majority to pass. Both categories of proposals must be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for review. Previously, the French representative proposed an attached amendment, which was rejected by a vote of thirteen to eight. The Dutch representative's proposal that the Regulations Committee's voting should adopt a simple majority system was also rejected by a vote of ten to nine.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 7th) After a four-hour meeting last night, the Regulations Committee of the peace conference resolved the most thorny issue on the agenda, namely the voting rules. The representatives at the peace conference felt relieved this morning. During the morning meeting yesterday, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov engaged in a fierce debate, and the crisis of a public break-up of the peace conference threatened to escalate.</p>
<p>The Rift Widens Further, Chairman Promotes Compromise</p>
<p>During the afternoon meeting, Byrnes and Yugoslavian representative Kardelj engaged in another heated exchange, further widening the rift. Fortunately, Committee Chairman and Foreign Minister Spaak bravely stepped forward and was finally able to promote a compromise. Before the evening meeting, Spaak consulted with the chief representatives for fifteen minutes. Recognizing that it was difficult to reach an agreement immediately, Spaak decided to resume open discussion during the evening meeting. For two full hours, Spaak strived for compromise, but was surrounded by a series of questions, interferences, suggestions, requests, and explanations. The debate not only made no progress, but actually regressed. Of particular note was that the consistently hostile attitude between the US and Soviet representatives during the morning meeting evolved into a sharp confrontation between the British and Soviet delegations during the evening meeting. The two main British representatives, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander and Under-Secretary of State McNeil, issued stern statements, but Soviet representatives Molotov and Vyshinsky responded in kind. Byrnes reclined in his chair, observing the verbal battle between the British and Soviet representatives with curiosity.</p>
<p>Britain Wags its Lion's Tail, Ultimately Achieves Victory</p>
<p>However, when the "rebellious" amendments of the smaller countries were put to a vote, the three major powers suddenly united and worked together to defeat the New Zealand amendment. The Soviet Union was satisfied with one important point because the amendment advocated a simple majority system, while the Soviet Union's all-day fire was aimed at supporting the two-thirds majority rule. But the real test came when the British amendment was put to a vote, which stipulated that both a simple majority system and a two-thirds majority system should be included. The Soviet delegation tried to defeat this amendment, but part of the amendment also conformed to the Soviet side's views. The British lion's tail then wagged rapidly. The British representative resolutely rejected any compromise, and Britain ultimately achieved victory, just as the Soviet Union had achieved victory when voting on the New Zealand amendment. It can now be fully expected that the Regulations Committee will proceed smoothly in the future and conclude its work on the afternoon of the 8th. At that time, the peace conference can change direction and begin to consider the various peace treaty drafts proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Clear Division Between Two Major Blocs, Many Hidden Reefs Remain in the Future of the Peace Conference <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, July 7th (Broadcast): A serious rift has developed between the Soviet bloc and the Western powers, which is enough to threaten the success of the 21-nation peace conference. Delegates to the conference, seeing the animosity arising from the disputes in the Regulations Committee, feel deeply anxious and anticipate that the conference will trigger fierce debate, cunning tactics, and delaying policies when discussing the draft peace treaties. Due to the continuous debates over the past week, the representatives all feel exhausted. As a result, the Regulations Committee did not hold its usual meeting this morning, but only held a meeting in the afternoon. Observers believe that France's loyalty to the Western powers and China's open support for the Western bloc are particularly noteworthy. Molotov and Vyshinsky spoke a total of thirteen times during yesterday's long debate. Although they engaged in heated exchanges and used clever tactics, they suffered miserable defeats in every decisive vote.</p>

<p>(United Press, London, July 6th) According to well-informed diplomatic sources, experts from the US State Department and the British Foreign Office have completed drafting the draft peace treaty with Japan. US and British experts began informal discussions several months ago and are currently studying the issues that should be included in the joint US-British draft. It is said that US and British experts are only exchanging views on technical aspects and are only drafting the outline of the peace treaty, without yet addressing the details.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, July 6th] The Palestine issue, which has reached a delicate and critical stage, will be discussed by the British Cabinet tomorrow. It is not yet known whether President Truman's resolution on the partition plan for Palestine will be delivered to London by then. It is rumored that powerful Jewish figures in the United States are applying maximum pressure to get the US President to reject the plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, July 6th] Acting US Secretary of State Acheson told reporters here that the US government has not yet decided whether to reject or accept the new plan regarding Palestine. This matter must be determined after consultation between President Truman's cabinet's Palestine committee and the US experts who drafted the plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, July 6th] According to Arab sources here, the best solution to the Palestine problem is to revoke the British mandate over the region and declare Palestine an independent state, joining the Arab League. Jews would enjoy broad autonomy, with rights completely equal to those enjoyed by Arabs. Furthermore, it is widely believed that the foreign ministers of Arab countries will hold a meeting in Alexandria from the 10th to the 15th. It is reported that this meeting will discuss various political issues, including the Anglo-Egyptian treaty.</p>

If the former approach is taken, he should ask the Muslim League and the Congress Party to simultaneously submit the names of their representatives. The Congress Party is expected to nominate six people, the Muslim League is expected to nominate five people, and ethnic minorities are expected to nominate two or three people.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Byrnes and Molotov Engage in Four-Hour Verbal Battle, Each Side Sticks to its Own Opinion and Counterattacks, Atmosphere in Meeting Hall Once Became Tense <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>"Reuters, Paris, July 6th" The Regulations Committee of the Paris Peace Conference met this morning in a tense atmosphere. For the past four hours, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov engaged in a fierce debate. When the Regulations Committee resumed debating the issue of voting on proposals by a two-thirds majority or by a simple majority,</p>
<p>Byrnes immediately criticized Molotov, accusing him of misunderstanding the attitude of the US delegation. Byrnes also pointed to the Soviet delegation from time to time, refuting Molotov's statement yesterday that the US had rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers during the Paris Peace Conference. He stated: Molotov's purpose in advocating the convening of a meeting of the four foreign ministers was to manipulate and preside over the meetings of the committees. His intention was to have the Council of Foreign Ministers consider the various proposals, but he also knew that this was not in line with the facts. This misunderstands the US position. I hope that all participating member states can understand this fact. When the Soviet representative does not get his way, he often arbitrarily attacks the motives of his colleagues, but this strategy does not help him, and even the most patient person will eventually express anger. Furthermore, the United States' resolution in paying attention to the Soviet Union is to often limit a small number of countries from concluding the great cause of peace, while the US delegation has always advocated broad participation by 21 countries. As in the London Council of Foreign Ministers last autumn and the two Paris conferences, the United States defended the rights of France and China to participate in various discussions. When the US delegation moved for an amendment to the rules of procedure, Molotov's words and deeds were inconsistent when the US delegation supported it. For example, last week, the Soviet representative suggested amending the already drafted peace treaty so that Poland could participate in the committee meeting discussing the Hungarian issue. Also, when deciding to invite various countries to participate in the peace conference, there was no mention of procedural issues at the time, but Molotov insisted the next day that a draft of the procedural rules must be attached before the invitation could be issued. I have repeatedly stated that if the Council of Foreign Ministers submits a draft procedure to the peace conference, the United States will reserve the right to support reasonable proposals from participating countries, but this procedural rule must not bind the peace conference, and the peace conference should formulate its own procedural rules. This statement has been recorded in the minutes of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and I have also made many speeches with the same meaning. Molotov has participated in various meetings many times and must have heard this statement. I think he will agree that his speech yesterday will inevitably cause my surprise. Judging from this, what Molotov can say must only be to agree to support the procedural rules put forward by the Council of Foreign Ministers. The US representative is determined to keep his word. The records I just mentioned can be judged by you and the public. We in the United States have newspapers with freedom of speech, so the Soviet representative can know that his remarks criticizing the motives of the US delegation will surely be published in the newspapers. I trust the Soviet people, and I ask Molotov to publish my speech this morning in the Soviet newspapers for the Soviet people to read. When the United States agreed to provide assistance, the Soviet people did not doubt the United States, and we did our best to provide assistance. We admire the Soviet people. Although we are criticizing Molotov today, it does not diminish our admiration for the Soviet people. When Byrnes was speaking,</p>
<p>Molotov repeatedly tilted his head, listening to the interpreter's translation. He then stood up to reply, and the atmosphere in the meeting hall was in turmoil. When Molotov spoke, he did not reduce his calm tone, but waved his arms from time to time, stating: The Soviet delegation suggested convening a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss several issues, including the chairmanship committee. This is a fact, but is there any concern that this can be criticized? Is there anything hindering our work? The Soviet delegation also wanted to set the procedure before the meeting, which is also a fact, and to be precise, the procedure has already been drafted. We discussed this procedural issue for a week, but before opening this peace conference, we have not discussed the main issues. If we do not predetermine the procedure first, it will take another week, - the third week - to obtain a resolution. This is also a fact. I believe that predetermining the procedure is an extremely proper process, but this draft procedural rules is by no means manipulating the peace conference, but only for reference. The point that we advocate that the four foreign ministers should meet from time to time during the peace conference is to facilitate the four foreign ministers' discussion of the various issues studied by the peace conference and to exchange opinions. When the debate on this matter began, several countries withdrew their reservations, but in fact this draft procedure has been unanimously adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Today, several countries seem to have gone astray in the peace conference, but the Soviet Union and France are still following the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The British and American delegations are talking about their reservations, and this cannot be regarded as consistent words and deeds. We do not need to argue right and wrong here, but please judge based on the facts. The amendment proposed by the Soviet Union has been agreed to by the four foreign ministers. Our intention is to prevent possible opposition. If there are objections to this amendment, we can discuss it further, but the purpose of this amendment is not to overthrow the joint resolution of the Council of Foreign Ministers, nor to allow this resolution to be abandoned. Byrnes means to declare that the procedural rules cannot bind small countries. We believe that this is unnecessary, because this has been agreed to by the four countries and supported by the countries participating in the peace conference. We support Byrnes' suggestion, and the problem has been solved. Regarding the issues that have not yet been agreed upon, we can freely judge them, freely express our opinions, and the Soviet delegation will pay attention to listening to the opinions of all countries, consider them carefully, and pay attention to any suggestions that are beneficial to the peace conference and peace. Byrnes requested that Soviet newspapers publish his speech because his speech yesterday has been published in American newspapers. We can accept this proposal. His full speech will be published in Soviet newspapers for the Soviet people to read. Regarding freedom of speech, some people have heard that the American press has an organization that controls most of the American newspapers. For example, British Attorney General Shawcross recently criticized some British newspapers and advocated that British newspapers should publish "This newspaper is run by whom" and "No guarantee that the records are consistent with the facts" on the front page. We have the same feeling and sympathize with the fact that they cannot read newspapers with fair opinions. The Soviet delegation now hopes to ensure that Soviet newspapers hold fair opinions to live up to expectations," Molotov said sincerely, and everyone listened attentively to Molotov's satire. The Soviet delegation occasionally laughed, and Byrnes also listened to the satire. Chairman Spaak announced that the various amendments regarding the two-thirds vote will be discussed again at 4:00 PM this afternoon, and then adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] According to a statement today by MacArthur's headquarters: The puppet emperor Puyi will appear in court as a witness during the trial of war criminals. This was proposed to the Soviet Union by the international defense team, but the date has not been revealed. The Soviet Union has agreed to extradite Puyi and four former Kwantung Army and Tanaka generals (names not announced) to Japan to testify in court. Puyi is currently under Soviet custody in Vladivostok and will reside in the Soviet embassy during his stay in Japan, "under continued Soviet supervision."</p>
<p>[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 7th] After the International Tribunal opened this morning, the first to be cross-examined by Japanese defense lawyer Lin was former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengzhai. (Question) According to the Matsumuro-Qin Dechun Agreement, did the Japanese side request the Chinese army to move on July 26th, and did the Chinese army refuse this request? (Answer) Although the Chinese side hoped for peace, the Japanese side did not fulfill the agreement, and ultimately, hope was lost due to the ultimatum on July 26th. They had no choice but to implement full-scale resistance, with the commander of the 29th Army ordering the recapture of Fengtai. (Question) Based on the testimony of the witnesses, was it not the responsibility of the Chinese side to drag the incident into a major war when the incident could have been resolved through diplomatic negotiations? (Answer) The responsibility lies entirely with the Japanese side. After Wang finished his testimony, Chinese witness Captain Zhang Tingfang, who urgently needed to return to China, testified early. He said: "I was an officer in the Army Medical Department. After Nanjing was occupied by the Japanese army, I remained there to care for the wounded Chinese soldiers. Knowing that the Red Cross emblem was ineffective, we wore civilian clothes and entered refugee camps. On the 6th, we were escorted to Xiaguan in a line a three-quarters of a mile long, with more than 5,000 people. Upon arriving at Xiaguan, we saw about 800 Japanese officers and machine guns firing for four hours. I jumped into the river and escaped, but I was shot in the shoulder from behind. I pretended to be a coolie to avoid detection." Following Captain Zhang, former retired Army General Tada Shun, wearing a kimono, took the witness stand. His testimony stated: From August 1937 to December 1938, he served as Vice Chief of Staff. Shanghai was occupied on November 12, 1937, and Nanjing was occupied on December 13, 1937. The operational plan for the Japanese army's capture of Hankou was planned on October 27, 1938. The plan to occupy Shanghai was established when the Shanghai Incident occurred. The plan to occupy Nanjing was established during the Battle of Songhu. The plan to occupy Hankou was established in June or July 1938. The Battle of August 13th was a hasty plan initiated by the navy to support the army, and everything was unprepared. They had no choice but to transport troops by warship. At that time, the plan had no temporary or permanent nature, but was planned with the goal of achieving peace after occupying Nanjing. After Tada, the manager of Standard Oil of New York in Shanghai, Delan, testified, recounting the atrocities of the Japanese army during the occupation of Hankou.</p>

<p>Promoting Friendship on the Surface, Secretly Continuing Ill Will</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] The head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that France is adopting a dual policy in Vietnam, appearing to promote friendship while actually undermining it. He also stated that the French-Vietnamese conflict in Bảo Ninh, in which twelve French soldiers were killed and forty-two wounded, was caused by French provocations. The military agreement concerning French troops in Vietnam, which was reached in April, has been repeatedly violated by the French side. France is creating incidents in Vietnam in many ways, and the Bảo Ninh incident is a clear indication of the French side's conspiracy to induce public opinion against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese delegation came to France to negotiate the country's status within the French Union.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Silver Prices Soar in London and New York <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Silver prices have recently soared in London and New York. The new official price in London is 55.5 pence per ounce, an increase of 11.5 pence from the previous price. There are two reasons for the increase. First, the pressure exerted by the American silver group, which has the support of some members of Congress and most silver producers in the United States. Second, the world's demand for silver is extremely urgent. President Truman must yield to the demands of the silver group, or at least has already yielded to a considerable extent. The group proposes increasing the silver price to $1.29 per ounce, and the price of platinum has also risen to $85 per ounce.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko today criticized the U.S. plan to control atomic energy, believing that it undermines national sovereignty, and formally declared: the Soviet Union cannot agree to establish a monitoring system. Gromyko told the UN Atomic Energy Commission: the United States asks other countries to trust the goodwill of the United States, but at the same time, the United States doubts the goodwill of other countries. China, the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Mexico immediately asked Gromyko: If there is no monitoring system, how can we discover a country that is preparing to use atomic weapons to launch an aggression? Gromyko replied with another question, namely, how can the Security Council discover aggression, regardless of the weapons used? Dutch representative 克·芬斯 (Kè Fēnsī, likely a transliteration) said: He believes that the world should prevent aggression with atomic weapons, and should not be satisfied with merely punishing those who disrupt peace, as proposed in the Soviet plan.</p>

<p>[United Press, Muroc, California, 6th] Two U.S. Army B-17 drones departed from Hilo Airport on the island of Hawaii and landed safely at the Army base here today after a non-stop flight of 2,400 miles, setting the longest flight record in aviation history completely without human pilots. Each aircraft was controlled by a mother ship, with one flight lasting 15 hours and the other 15 hours and 40 minutes. The speed at an altitude of 6,500 feet was from 150 to 165 miles per hour. When these drones take off, they are controlled by ground personnel using equipment mounted on jeeps. Once they leave the runway, they are controlled by the mother ship. Landing is also taken over by ground personnel when the aircraft is about 800 feet off the ground. During flight, the mother ship controls the drone from a distance of 200 feet to 3 miles. As the drone approached the California coast, it automatically opened and closed its bomb bay doors, dropping a practice smoke bomb. The bombing operation was also controlled by the mother ship from a distance.</p>

How Vast is the Power of Korean Son Chang-shik? <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Report by Our Correspondent] According to what our paper's reporter has learned, a Korean named Son Tian-chang-shik (孫田昌植, changed his name to Son Chang-shik 孫昌植 after the victory) established a large-scale armaments factory in this city during the War of Resistance Against Japan, serving the enemy and puppet forces, and manufacturing sharp military weapons for the Japanese army. After the victory, someone secretly reported this to the Third Front Army, and the factory's materials were confiscated. Later, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau was established, and the case was transferred to the Bureau by the Third Front Army. At the end of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the confiscated materials were suddenly returned. The informant was dissatisfied with this handling and recently appealed to the Reception and Investigation Committee. Yesterday, the Investigation Committee specially summoned the appellant to the station, paying close attention to the case. A full account of the details, simply gathered, is as follows: Korean Son Tian-chang-shik has resided in this city for many years. He established a small-scale workshop at the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road. He was not wealthy and made a living repairing typewriters and cameras. Due to his wife's (Japanese) connections, he became acquainted with Colonel 澀谷 (Shibuya) of the First Naval Supply Department of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai and was assigned to manufacture and repair various military weapons. With Shibuya's help, he obtained a large loan from the enemy Hankou Bank. After obtaining the loan, Son greatly expanded his business, moving the factory to No. 807 North Sichuan Road, under the name "Shanghai Precision Machinery Arts Society." At that time, the enemy was purchasing various hard coins (silver coins, copper coins, aluminum coins, nickel coins, etc.) and various military metal raw materials from our occupied areas, all of which were handled by Son. Also, around the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he accepted an invitation from the enemy Army Department and flew to Nanjing to contract for the repair of all the machines in the Jinling Arsenal (the largest arsenal in the capital, which was seized by the enemy after the occupation). Around September of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], the Japanese military took over the main factory at No. 927 Bubbling Well Road, originally owned by the British merchant Moutrie &amp; Co., and handed it over to Son for use, signing a contract and operating it under the name of military management, specializing in the repair and manufacture of military equipment for the military. Son then changed the address of No. 807 North Sichuan Road to a product showroom and renamed the Moutrie &amp; Co. main factory as "Dai Nippon Military Management Moutrie &amp; Co. Shanghai Precision Machinery Arts Society," specializing in the manufacture and repair of military equipment such as aircraft parts, machine gun parts, flamethrowers, bayonets, bullets, copper pumps, etc., and the repair of small tanks, armored cars, and mortars. Son's closest contact with the Japanese military was with the 登 (Deng) No. 1627 unit, whose military equipment and any projects were entrusted to Son for manufacture. During the 31st year of the Republic [1942], to curry favor with the Japanese invaders, Son presented five fighter planes, for which the then Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo specially issued a letter of gratitude. Due to the support of the Japanese chiefs, the company's business was extensive, employing more than 200 Chinese workers and dozens of Japanese, Korean, Jewish, and White Russian technicians. In the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, to cope with Allied bombing, the company had anti-aircraft guns installed on the roof for protection, which nearby residents had witnessed. After the victory, Son immediately closed down the factory and transferred a large amount of military supplies to No. 1350 Seymour Road. This was secretly reported to the Second Section of the Third Front Army, and Director Mao sent personnel to inspect. On October 23rd of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], personnel were sent again, and military hardware and manufactured products amounting to thousands of tons were seized. Important account books were also seized at the Moutrie &amp; Co. office at No. 60 Nanjing Road. A large number of aluminum and copper ingots were also seized at Son's residence on Route Pétain, and 16 barrels of gasoline and more than 100 boxes of auto parts, as well as 45 gold bars (450 taels), were found in a secret basement. After being confiscated by the Third Front Army, they were transferred to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau. In late December of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau considered the evidence insufficient and returned the confiscated materials to Son Chang-shik. The original informant was dissatisfied and appealed to the Investigation Committee, requesting an investigation into the truth to prevent the enemy arms dealer with war criminal suspicions from escaping.</p>

<p>[Report by Our Correspondent] On the eve of the August 8th Father's Day, the Shanghai YMCA held a Father's Day celebration at the auditorium between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM yesterday. More than 200 people attended. Mr. Yan Huiqing also attended, and Pan Gongzhan, suffering from a cold, sent his secretary to represent him.</p>
<p>After the opening music, the assembly sang "Ode to Father"—"Toil, toil, Father's toil, I love my father heart and soul. Lamb kneels for milk, bird feeds back, I love my mother, I love my father; For me, take up hammer and axe, for me, take up bow and crossbow; Thorns and forests plow and hoe, green fields a thousand miles field and garden. Old trees, roots and soil, generations of toil, father and ancestors, drop by drop of sweat, grain by grain of millet, father and ancestors, children and fathers; Wind and rain, worry and toil, children and grandchildren sing and dance; Toil, toil, Father's toil, I love my father heart and soul." The song was written by Fei (費) and composed by Huang Yijun (黃貽鈞), sincere and thought-provoking.</p>

<p>The Meaning of Father</p>
<p>After Chairman Lu Ganchen (陸幹臣) reported on the origins of Father's Day, Yan Huiqing gave a speech. He cited the meaning of the two characters "Father" and spoke of "Heavenly Father" and "National Father," who should receive the highest respect and love. He talked about when he was studying in the United States, the teachers in the school were very concerned about the students, as intimate as family members. Chinese students did not have such good fortune and could only hope that fathers could shoulder their responsibilities. Every father should take some time every day to teach their children, but now most fathers are busy with wine, women, wealth, and temper. "So," he said, "the meaning of Father's Day is twofold. On the one hand, children must learn to love their fathers, and on the other hand, fathers must learn to cultivate themselves, manage their families, and broaden their horizons to teach their children. This is of great benefit to the country and the race."</p>
<p>Cultivation and Enlightenment</p>
<p>Pi Yu (皮禹) then delivered a speech, talking about the meaning and enlightenment of Father's Day. He said: "Father's Day was initiated last year under the enemy puppet oppression before the victory by several loyal and unyielding people, who wore plum blossom-shaped national flowers to imply their nostalgia for their motherland, linking loyalty and filial piety together, and organized donations to help poor students, etc. All of this is the expression of national consciousness, the manifestation of national integrity, and the promotion of national morality. And Father's Day has three points of enlightenment for us: First, because of this War of Resistance Against Japan, we realize clearly that as long as national consciousness exists, the country's future is absolutely hopeful. Secondly, it makes us understand our position in the family and society and the responsibility of inheriting and leading. It is after the commemoration of Father's Day that it can serve as a guideline for our lives, and due to thinking about our father's concern for us, we should be self-conscious and self-disciplined at all times."</p>
<p>After the speeches, the YMCA's "Mandarin Worship Sacred Music Troupe" performed musical programs. A soprano solo "How Can I Not Think of Him" and a tenor solo "Who is Sylvia" both won clear applause.</p>
<p>A Good Father</p>
<p>After reading the Heavenly Father's Ode, Han Wenzao (韓文藻), the organizer of the celebration, stood up to introduce a "good father," Qian Shiyong. Mr. Qian is 58 years old, has five sons and two daughters, and is a director of the Shanghai Northern Baptist Church, running a Yongli Plumbing Engineering Materials store. He is very enthusiastic about public welfare. The YMCA initiated the tea promotion association, and Mr. Qian donated a lot of tea cups and tea sets, and he especially devoted himself to the education of his children. His two sons, Qian Yuanfu and Qian Yuangui, were also invited to the stage. Yuangui took flowers, and Yuanfu reported his father's virtues to the audience. They gave the flowers to their father amid applause, also representing the respect of millions of children for their fathers.</p>
<p>The celebration ended in the echoes of another program by the "Mandarin Worship Sacred Music Troupe," a duet "Duet from Season." Chairman Lu Ganchen finally reported: The Father's Day Promotion Committee and the Shanghai Student Relief Committee will, tomorrow (that is, today), raise commemorative flowers in [missing characters] lively places in the city, and the proceeds will be used entirely to help poor students.</p>
<p>Regulations for Commemorative Ceremony</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xiang Kangyuan, the owner of Kangyuan Canning Factory, was previously reported by employees on suspicion of being a traitor. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was formally prosecuted. Xiang himself left Shanghai for elsewhere after the victory. The case was investigated yesterday by the High Court. The defendant's defense lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Huang Jiyuan, attended and claimed to the court that Xiang himself had previously been ill in Chongqing, with a diagnosis and prescription from a local hospital as proof. However, there has been no news for two months. The lawyers pointed out that the defendant has a high reputation in the industrial sector, and the only false position he held was as a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee. If the court urgently needs to close the case, it can issue a default judgment in accordance with Article 298 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court immediately stated: The case has been delayed for a long time, and the defense lawyers can inform the defendant's family to find a way to notify the defendant to come to the court as soon as possible to settle the case. The matter of a default judgment will be decided by this court. The case is adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Pan Yangyao Underwent Trial Yesterday, Denying Guilt on All Charges and Requesting an End to Detention, Pending a Ruling on the Application <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Yangyao is 54 years old and a native of Jiading. After the victory, the Shanghai office of the Military Statistics Bureau arrested him on suspicion of being a traitor and sent him to the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court for investigation, which filed a public prosecution. The case was heard yesterday afternoon in the High Court by Judge Cao Jun. Pan wore a white silk long gown, gray socks, and black cloth shoes, holding a paper fan. His hair was cut short and was already turning white. After the judge asked about his name, age, and origin, he stated: Before the war, he had been working as a secretary at the Four Banks Joint Savings Society. During the war, he went to the interior several times to investigate industries. Later, he was resented by "No. 76" for this reason, and a shot was fired in front of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, but fortunately, it did not hit him. Later, he was arrested twice by the Japanese Kempeitai and then fled to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, he met Zhou Xianggeng, who wanted to establish a Jiyongfeng Bank in Shanghai and invited him to invest. The bank had registered with the Ministry of Industry in Chongqing and obtained a license from the Ministry of Finance. He felt it was legitimate, so he invested 3,000 to 4,000 yuan and was elected as a director. At that time, the total capital was about 500,000 yuan, which had increased to 30 million yuan in puppet currency by the time of the victory. The address was No. 68 Ningbo Road, and it has now been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be liquidated. The chairman was originally Zhao Zhendong, but he died of illness, so he was allowed to temporarily replace him. The bank was entirely organized by people from the industrial and commercial sectors and had no dealings with the enemy or puppets. All the shareholders totaled more than 1,000 people, and there were no puppet officials in the board of directors or supervisors. At that time, it was a public offering of shares, and he was in Hong Kong, so Wang Yongkang, Xiang Kangyuan, and others joined, which he did not know beforehand. The bank was purely a commercial bank that provided small industrial and commercial loans and did not hoard goods or disrupt finance. As for the articles published, "How to Increase Production" was written because the enemy and puppets had destroyed the national goods factories, and the people's livelihood was difficult, so he loudly appealed for "Self-Reliance and Dignified Survival Requirements," meaning that the Chinese nation, like other nations, should be self-reliant, dignified, independent, and equal. His true intention was to let the Japanese know that the Chinese were not easily deceived. At that time, he took a bold risk because of a passionate heart that could not be suppressed, and only then did he write this article. Now, however, the prosecutor is taking it out of context, and he is being sued for this. The defendant will not admit guilt under any circumstances. Lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Yu Enliang provided defense. Judge Cao then asked Pan if he was a party member. He replied no. He was then asked if he had joined any other party. He replied no. Judge Cao said that this was irrelevant and told him to speak freely. Pan still replied: The defendant is a scholar who only does business and does not hold any political positions. The court then ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing. Pan immediately requested: The defendant has been detained for nearly half a year, and has been sick with a fever in prison for days. He is forced to appear in court today, can he apply for bail to suspend detention? The court replied that according to legal procedures, he should submit an application and await a ruling. Pan was then escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Xizhi, the principal figure in the grain loan case, was issued a summons by the Land Prosecutor's Office after returning from the United States, ordering him to appear in court for investigation at 9:00 AM yesterday. However, Yang Xizhi did not appear in court yesterday morning. According to the prosecutor in charge of the case, the summons was sent by registered mail several days ago to the Ministry of Food in Nanjing to be forwarded to Yang Xizhi. However, due to the customs of the Chinese officialdom, the transfer was slow and time-consuming. Therefore, whether Yang's failure to appear today was because he had not yet received the notice, the Land Prosecutor's Office is currently investigating the cause. If it is resistance to the summons, the Land Prosecutor's Office will review the situation and consider issuing an arrest warrant.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Jiangsu-Northern Refugee Relief Association held a tea party at the Red Cotton Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to host the press and contestants from each group of the "Miss Shanghai" election. The tea party was hosted by Wang Xianqing, the general director of the association, and Wu Kaixian, the deputy chairman and director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also attended in person. The most enthusiastic contestants were from the dance star group and the singer group. The dance star group included Guan Minli, Gu Lihua, Zhou Lijuan, and Ye Meimei, who are all popular stars in the dance world. It is also learned that Li Zhen and Li Zhenzhen have also decided to participate, but were unable to attend due to other commitments. The singer group included Zhang Yiwen, Lang Yin, Zheng Yun, Li Rong, Bai Yun, and Dong Peipei, totaling six people. Only Yuan Xuefen and Shi Yinhua from the Yue Opera group attended; the rest did not attend.</p>
<p>At the tea party, Wang Xianqing first reported the "Significance of Electing Miss Shanghai," stating that it was not a frivolous act and that the motivation was only to help disaster victims with the spirit of human mutual aid. Then, Director Wu delivered a speech, briefly stating that the fundraising target for this time is 2 billion yuan. In addition to the 1.5 billion yuan that has been separately identified by the industrial and financial sectors, raising the remaining amount is quite difficult. Therefore, this election was launched in the hope of mobilizing all the citizens of Shanghai to work together to help 3 million refugees. Director Wu also repeatedly stated that the election is purely for disaster relief and not a frivolous act, and he hoped that all sectors would enthusiastically support it. Suddenly, Lu Jinrong, the chairman of the Radio Industry Association, stood up and asked Yuan Xuefen from the Yue Opera group to speak. Yuan immediately expressed that she was willing to fulfill other obligations but did not intend to participate in the election. Lu stood up again to supplement Yuan's statement, saying that the Yue Opera group did not want to participate because "people's words are terrible." He also hoped that the press would "show mercy in writing" in the future. Wang Xianqing immediately stated that Yuan's opinion only represented her personally. Director Wu also thought that Lu's words were close to being inappropriate, so he stood up and spoke again, expressing his deep gratitude for the enthusiastic assistance of the press and said that the phrase "people's words are terrible" should be changed to "people's words are lovely." In this way, it can be more sincere and friendly, and the goal of raising funds for disaster relief can be easily achieved. After the meeting, it was learned that another person, Miss Zhang Xuefeng, had joined the debutante group. Zhang is from Shaoxing, 19 years old, and a high-achieving student at Xiaoming Girls' High School. Therefore, including Miss Gao Qingyi, who was the first to sign up, there are now two people. It is also heard that there are still six people in the process of completing registration procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Chongxin Yarn Factory Robbery Case Solved; Gangsters Panic and Leave Behind a Briefcase, Finding Clues; Nine Major Criminals Arrested One After Another <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The huge 20 million yuan robbery that occurred at the Chongxin Yarn Factory at No. 1 Xiguangfu Road, Zhabei, at 10:00 AM on the 27th of last month involved more than ten gangsters, each carrying rapid-fire and slow-fire machine guns and all with rich experience in street fighting. Therefore, although the factory requested police assistance and patrolman Xu Senfu and others from the Zhi Ren Village Substation opened fire, the gangsters were equally unwilling to show weakness and returned fire to resist arrest. The two sides held out for as long as 25 minutes, and finally the gangsters escaped with the money while fighting and retreating. Along the way, they hijacked passing trucks twice. All the details were recorded in this newspaper on the 28th. It has now been reported that all the major principal offenders and accomplices have been arrested one after another, except for six who were arrested and hidden in this city, the rest were captured by tracking them to Suzhou and Jiaxing and other places. The following is a record of the investigation and solution of the case:</p>
<p>Detectives Dispatched as Far as Suzhou and Jiaxing</p>
<p>It was found that after the gangsters hijacked the first vehicle that day, one of the gangsters fell off the vehicle due to the vehicle traveling too fast on Zhongshan Road, causing a serious head injury. The remaining gangsters then hijacked another ten-ton truck, ordered the driver to get out of the vehicle, and helped the gangster into the vehicle to continue moving forward. However, in this hasty time, the gangsters left behind a briefcase, which was immediately seized by the Putuo Road Sub-bureau. A Suzhou epidemic prevention certificate was found inside, with the name Li Zaiyang. Therefore, based on this clue, an investigation was launched, and it was learned that Li Zaiyang is currently the Deputy Captain of the Fourth Brigade of the Minhang Jiangsu Water Police Headquarters. On July 11, he asked Su Jin, the Captain of the Headquarters, for a week's leave to purchase military sugar and uniforms for the team. After being approved for four days, Li disappeared without a trace. The police then dispatched officers to Songjiang and Suzhou based on the investigation report (because Li had once served as a major captain in Songjiang). They were arrested at the residence of his sister, Li Suying, at No. 15 Tongdeli, Qianjie, Suzhou County. According to her, Li did not come to Suzhou. After searching his home, a letter was found under a wooden box, with the address Jiang Jingbo, No. 48 Chaicao Chang, Jiaxing. At this time, the police had learned that Li's wife's name was Jiang Jingbo, and the traces of inspection were still fresh, so it was determined that Jiang had undoubtedly fled to Jiaxing.</p>
<p>Boat Girl Arrested in Small Village</p>
<p>At that time, Li Suying was first escorted to Shanghai, and another team continued to go to No. 46 Chaicao Chang, Jiaxing, to investigate. The place was a slum with many residents. Although inquiries were made, no one knew Jiang Jingbo. Later, the police officers informed them of her appearance and characteristics, etc., and they learned that she was the boat girl who was very popular in Nanhu two years ago and had recently returned here from Shanghai. She is currently living in a small village about three miles away. The police officers went to the address and found Jiang and another man nicknamed Little Dongyang, Yang Fengxiang, sitting together and talking and laughing. Seeing the police officers arrive suddenly, they surrendered. However, she firmly refused to reveal her husband's whereabouts, only admitting that her husband had indeed shared 6.1 million yuan in stolen money with Xia Kun and Little Dongyang during the robbery.</p>
<p>Six More Captured in Shanghai</p>
<p>At that time, the Shanghai side also received reports from informants starting on the 29th and first captured Zhao Xiaolaohan, a key criminal in the case, 27 years old, from Jiangbei. After the gangster divided 1.25 million yuan in stolen money, he still set up a pancake stall at No. 270 Longqingli, Xikang Road, to avoid attracting attention. According to his confession, the accomplices Li Wangen (also known as Little * Zi) and * * Chuan were re-* * obtained, and two rapid-fire machines, one revolver, and thirty rounds of bullets were seized from Bian's residence (No. 160 Zhangjiazhai, Qimei Road). After * interrogation, he confessed that the case was initiated by his brother Jinlong and Xia Kun, Li Zai * and others. However, his brother was injured on the day of * the accident and has now left Shanghai to go to Suzhou for treatment. At the same time, the Putuo Road Sub-bureau also arrested an accomplice, * Qilin (also known as Qilin), and learned that the main offender Xia Jinlong had not left Shanghai. The Changning Road Sub-bureau then sent officers to investigate in four directions and arrested him at the Jiaxing Road Bridge in Yokohama on the 30th. Bian had hired a small boat, intending to escape to Suzhou via the Yokohama, Pujiang, and Suzhou Rivers to Suzhou for treatment. The boat fee was 50,000 yuan. However, when he was arrested, Bian's injuries were very serious, so the police station immediately sent him to the police hospital for treatment. After strict interrogation, another main offender, Xia Kun, was arrested at No. 63 Kangjiaqiao. At this point, all the criminals in the case, except for Li Zaiyang who was at large, had almost all been arrested. It is heard that all the pre-arranged arrangements for this robbery were planned by Xia Kun, who claimed to be a "staff officer," and Bian Jinlong was injured "on duty," so 2.1 million yuan was specifically set aside from the stolen money as treatment expenses.</p>

<p>Hua Luogeng and Others Will Lecture Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Education Bureau's summer training session for middle school teachers held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday, in the second floor of the central building of Jiaotong University. Deputy Director Li Ximou, Section Chief Chen Xuanshan, Section Chief Xie Engao, Commissioner Wang Dagang, Inspector Ma Jingxuan, personnel in charge of the session, and teachers from various schools, totaling over a hundred people, attended. Deputy Director Li presided over the ceremony.</p>
<p>Li Ximou's Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremonial greetings, Deputy Director Li gave a speech, stating that in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the four major universities in Shanghai jointly organized a summer training session for middle school teachers with the Municipal Education Bureau, and the number of middle school teachers participating was very enthusiastic. He also mentioned that in the summer schools of various European and American universities, there are middle school teacher refresher courses. The weather is really too hot, Deputy Director Li said, waving a paper fan. Our training session is also held to promote your further studies and improve the effectiveness of middle school education. This time, thanks to the help of Jiaotong University, the entire equipment of the library, physics laboratory, and chemistry laboratory is provided for our reference and practice. The lecturers of each subject are all nationally and globally renowned university professors, and we should express our satisfaction and gratitude. Finally, Deputy Director Li hoped that during the two weeks of the training session, everyone will use the new knowledge gained and the spirit of experimentation to jointly seek the improvement of middle school education in the city.</p>
<p>Chen Xuanshan's Speech</p>
<p>Following, Section Chief Chen Xuanshan gave a speech, stating that after the victory, newly published books and magazines in Shanghai, such as foreign original magazines and publications from the mainland, were sold out as soon as they arrived in Shanghai. This is a phenomenon of Shanghai people's intellectual famine, that is, Shanghai people's knowledge lags behind. This time, we are holding a middle school teacher training session to make up for this deficiency. Section Chief Chen also said that in a report by the League of Nations education inspection team ten years ago, there was a saying that our country's education is greatly influenced by American education, that is, it only pays attention to the discussion of teaching methods, and ignores the research of teaching material content. In fact, teaching methods are also very important. Few people in our country's middle school subjects conduct experimental research on teaching methods. This session pays great attention to this point, and hires lecturers to deliberate extensively, so that the research of teaching materials and the discussion of teaching methods are equally emphasized.</p>
<p>Wang Dagang's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Commissioner Wang Dagang reported on academic affairs and the preparation process, and said that he had received letters from middle school teachers in Suzhou and Wuxi requesting to join the lectures, but because the session did not have accommodation, he had to decline. Commissioner Wang also said that the location of the session is extremely convenient for transportation. Five bus routes stop at the entrance of Jiaotong University, and one tram station is a short walk away. In addition, Jiaotong University is full of trees and the grass is flat. The cool breeze makes one forget the sultry heat. We are both avoiding the heat and studying, as if we are in a fairyland. I hope everyone will pass this message to their colleagues and participate enthusiastically. The session is very welcome. Also, it is reported that the session will officially begin today, and lecturers Jiang Zhuzhuang, Hua Luogeng, Qian Zhongqing, etc., will all attend the session on the first day to lecture.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 7:00 PM on the 6th, a fire broke out in the barracks behind No. 332 Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu, due to the carelessness of a few soldiers on duty. The fire spread rapidly, and coupled with the dry weather, the flames soared into the sky and could not be stopped, threatening to spread to the street buildings. The general residents were very panicked and the order was chaotic, and petty thieves also took the opportunity to be active. More than a hundred members of the Shanghai Boy Scout Instructor Training Class from nearby Pingliang Road, under the command of Captain Li Jiguang, were the first to arrive at the disaster scene and volunteered to disperse the onlookers, which greatly facilitated the movement of fire trucks. They also assisted the police in temporarily setting up posts to control traffic. A group of members bravely entered the disaster area to help residents move materials and assist in the fire hoses. After fifty minutes, the fire was extinguished. The class returned to the class with songs of victory. Nearby residents applauded sincerely and happily along the way to express their gratitude.

<p>(31) Question: For the exercise of rights and the performance of obligations, should the place of original residence or the place of current residence be the standard?</p>
<p>Answer: The provision for current residence is to alleviate the deficiencies of original residence. If one already resides in the place of current residence, one should exercise rights and fulfill obligations in the place of current residence. However, if the laws and regulations governing the conferral of such rights and obligations stipulate otherwise, then those regulations shall prevail.</p>
<p>(32) Question: Should those sentenced to life imprisonment be included in the household registration?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they should still be included in the household registration, with detailed notes in the remarks column.</p>
<p>(33) Question: How should households fleeing from famine, which are of a short-term departure nature, be handled during the investigation?</p>
<p>Answer: When encountering such situations during the investigation, the household number should be reserved and temporarily not included in the household registration register.</p>
<p>(34) Question: When several households of foreign church members and several households of civil servants reside in a church, how should the household registration be compiled?</p>
<p>Answer: They should be compiled separately according to foreign households and ordinary households.</p>
<p>(35) Question: The household registration book takes the area under the jurisdiction of the household registration as a unit, and its numbering is arranged sequentially in chronological order. In this case, the order of the wards and sub-wards is not very neat, and inspection and statistics are also inconvenient. How should this be remedied?</p>
<p>Answer: A loose-leaf household registration book can be added, the content items and numbering of which are the same as the household registration book. After the initial household registration, if there is establishment of household registration, transfer of household registration, or removal of household registration, in addition to making changes in the relevant books, it can be added to or extracted from this loose-leaf household registration book at any time according to the order of the wards and sub-wards. Its compilation method is also compiled and bound according to the order of the wards and sub-wards, so as to facilitate inspection and registration, and benefit statistics.</p>
<p>(36) Question: Regarding the registration of permanent and temporary residents, if there are people from other provinces or counties who have lived in this county or city for several generations, or decades, or have lived for less than three years, and the male has no original residence, how should it be handled?</p>
<p>Answer: They should be ordered to apply for registration as having original residence. If they do not wish to register as having original residence, but wish to register as having current residence, it may be temporarily approved. However, after the household registration is processed in the province, county, or city of their original residence, the household should submit a registration with original residence to reduce the number of current residents without original residence and comply with the provisions of Article 4, Item 1 of the Household Registration Law.</p>
<p>(37) Question: If someone has one wife and two concubines living in three places, and household registration is processed in three places at the same time, how should the head of the household be filled out? How can duplication be avoided when compiling statistics?</p>
<p>Answer: Registration should be done in all three places. For the same head of the household, except for the current place of residence, if it is not the current place of residence, or a place where the accommodation time is shorter, the remarks column of the form should indicate where the head of the household goes, what position he holds, and whether he has a fixed residence or domicile, and indicate that when compiling statistics, the household should be counted in the current place of residence.</p>
<p>(38) Question: If the distance between migrations between wards is very far, can the order of the household registration book be changed accordingly?</p>
<p>Answer: In order to take into account the order of the households in the wards and sub-wards and the order of the household registration sea, the order after the migration can be temporarily arranged.</p>
<p>(39) Question: The household registration book stipulates that each book has one hundred pages, and each page is numbered. If a household registration matter occurs after one-time registration, how should it be added?</p>
<p>Answer: Now that household registration and personal registration take the township and town of the county and the district of the city as their jurisdiction, and should be numbered by ward, and the number of households in each ward should be filled in sequentially from No. 1 in the blank space of the number column "No." on the first paper of each household. When a new household applies for registration, it should still be connected and filled in, the purpose of which is to record the number of households, and each ward is the beginning and end. As for Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Amended Household Registration Law, which stipulates that the number compiled by the county and city governments or the establishment bureaus refers to the number of pages, it should be filled in the blank space of the two words "page" at the end of the registration book, the purpose of which is to record the number of pages, and each book is the beginning and end. The household number and the page number are very different, one is at the beginning of the paper, one is at the end of the paper, one is compiled by the township district according to the ward, and one is compiled by the county and city bureau according to the book. When this point is clear, the matter of establishing household registration is easy to handle.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Significance of Father's Day in Education <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Today marks only the second celebration of Father's Day! Although its history is so short, its significance is profound; especially its value in education, which is even more significant!</p>
<p>Every year in May, on the second Sunday, we enthusiastically celebrate "Mother's Day". It was initiated by an American woman who lost her mother at a young age in 1907, and it has now become an international Mother's Day. However, since ancient times, our country has valued filial piety, emphasizing both parents. The ancients said, "Father gave me life, and mother nurtured me." Now that there is a Mother's Day, how can there not be a day to commemorate fathers? Therefore, last year, during the most intense period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when victory was about to arrive, Yan Huiqing and others initiated the establishment of Father's Day on August 8th, taking the "eight eight" as a homophone for "father", making it easy to remember. This year, when the second Father's Day was held, Pan Gongzhan and others requested the central government to issue a clear decree to make it a national commemorative day. At the same time, the Father's Day Promotion Committee sent letters to the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries, jointly advocating its promotion, and it will soon become an international Father's Day.</p>
<p>Filial piety is originally an inherent virtue in our country, and it is also an important training in modern education. The youth code has the provision of "filial piety", and the central training also has the implementation of "filial piety week". Now that the advocacy of Father's Day has emerged, it can strengthen this training and achieve the purpose of education. Moreover, the meaning of filial piety is not limited to serving parents, supporting them physically, and following their wishes; if children cannot cultivate their character, study diligently, and strive to improve, they will fail to live up to the parents' hard work in raising them, and cannot be considered to have fully fulfilled their filial piety. Therefore, the promotion of Father's Day directly and indirectly increases educational efficiency.</p>
<p>The most important responsibility of a father is to educate his children, making them a sound and independent person. The ancients said, "Raising without teaching is the father's fault." The advocacy of Father's Day is enough to urge the general fathers to pay attention to their responsibilities, so as to avoid children from dropping out of school. National education will be universal without being universalized. Recently, the Father's Day Promotion Committee has been actively raising scholarships in order to reduce the burden on fathers and relieve out-of-school children. It is hoped that this meaningful movement can be universally launched and achieve great results, which is also a major contribution of this Father's Day to education.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] Due to the increasingly serious industrial and commercial crisis, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association have appointed representatives to travel to Nanjing by night train today to suggest rescue methods to the authorities and urge their implementation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce specially invited leaders of various major industries to see off the delegation at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM today. All parties attach great importance to this. According to opinions expressed by related parties, the number of factory shutdowns and store closures has been increasing day by day. Not only is industry on the verge of collapse, but commerce is also difficult to sustain. For example, in the silk, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn industries, dozens of companies have been closing down every day in the past ten days. Therefore, this petition is a last resort. According to those familiar with the financial market, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan last year, when the government resumed operations, the interest rate was around 8% per month. Afterwards, it gradually increased, reaching as high as 24-25% in May and June of this year, eventually leading to the turmoil at the end of June. Recently, it has fallen again, generally between 12-13%. However, the condition of industry and commerce has become even more sluggish. According to common observation, during the period of high interest rates in May and June, industry and commerce were actually drinking poison to quench their thirst, and their operating profits could not possibly bear this burden.</p>
<p>High Interest Rates Suppress, Daring Not Borrow</p>
<p>When the common interest rates suppressed and the vitality was exhausted, they realized that borrowing was not a solution after all. Stable people would rather close their doors than take on more debt. The out-of-town merchants in Shanghai also prepaid their funds for purchasing goods, because the actual sales in the inland areas were scarce. As a result, business became clearer and clearer, and no one dared to eat the dismantling interest. The situation was precarious. Those who did not hesitate to eat out-of-town funds at high interest rates to survive, the lenders did not dare to act. Therefore, on the surface, interest rates were reduced, but the funds of industry and commerce became tighter and tighter. According to news from the yarn and cloth industries, the Shanghai Zhuang established by various out-of-town merchants</p>
<p>Actual Sales Sluggish, Shanghai Zhuang Arbitrage Interest</p>
<p>Recently, they have indeed been doing things by scraping interest. Their method is to first deposit funds in the factory number and ask for interest, and the factory number will be forced to comply, because it covets its future business. When they receive a telegram to purchase goods, they will wait until the shipping date, and then talk about the payment period for five days or ten days, in order to wait for the dismantling interest funds they have released to be able to extend the date. The reason is ultimately due to the sluggish business, and the factory number is caused by accommodation. An authoritative source in the industrial sector revealed that the current monetary policy is loose on the surface but tight in reality, and the factory's production rate,</p>
<p>The Production Rate of Important Production Has Fallen Sharply</p>
<p>On average, it has fallen to 30-40%. Among them, the situation of silk weaving, knitting, handkerchief weaving, dyeing and weaving, wool textile, silk reeling industry, chemical industry, and machinery industry is even worse. The cigarette industry, which is known as the golden industry, is now losing money in every household. The electrical appliance and cosmetics industries have turned from profit to loss, making it even more difficult to stand. Factories in matches, paper making, and pharmaceuticals are superficially maintaining, but the cost is increasing day by day and the selling price is decreasing, making it difficult to continue. Yarn mills are called the darlings of heaven, but everyone pays attention to them, and the exploitation is above all industries. People in the industry are deeply afraid that good times will not last long and are not without burnout. Therefore, from the overall observation of the industrial sector, the loose monetary policy on the surface but tight in reality only increases the strike on factories. Moreover, there is no definite policy for international trade, and the worker's living index only hears the news of rising prices. The situation of collapse has already arrived.</p>
<p>Insufficient Power, Difficult to Relocate</p>
<p>The power generation equipment of the municipal power company lost one-third during the war. The Pudong and Nanshi electric companies have not been able to generate electricity until now. Although the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has recently made various efforts, it can generate a part of the electricity, but compared with before the war, it is only one-fifth. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Power Company, the power consumption of various major industries is currently less than 30% of that before the war. The weakness of the operating rate of factories in the city can be generally seen. Some factories borrowed the concessions as shelters during the war. Now they plan to rebuild the factory buildings on the ruins of the suburbs, as a step for future development. However, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong are now unable to add new power lines. This is a great obstacle to the future industrial revival. According to those close to the competent authority.</p>
<p>Revising Tariffs, Not Without Restraints</p>
<p>The International Trade Conference will be held in London in October, and all countries advocate the removal of tariff barriers and other trade barriers. Although the central government has a proposal to revise import and export tariffs, the protective meaning is still limited. Various industrial associations will express their opinions on this issue. The petition delegation revealed that this trip will make concise and emergency requests, and the industrial crisis will be especially concerned. All the above situations are being planned to be dealt with.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Gold and Paper Money Both Retracted Slightly <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The black market yesterday was mediocre. It opened at 1.923 million in the morning. After the opening, people's hearts were stable.

<h3 id="e98">Chinese Stocks Turned to Sideways Trading at High Levels, Foreign Stocks Still Had No Improvement <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks saw sideways trading at high levels and continued to inch up, but the buying momentum was weak. It was still hovering at the close. Yongsha first saw a high price of 715 yuan, Meiya 4,200 yuan, Jingfu 245 yuan, Xinguang 250 yuan, and Qinxing 187 yuan. In the morning, Yongsha fell to 690 yuan, Meiya 3,950 yuan, Jingfu 230 yuan, Xinguang 232 yuan, and Qinxing 168 yuan. Each of the less popular small and medium-sized stocks first firmed and then retreated. The result was still stable. Large investors still entered and exited abruptly and inconsistently. Compared with the previous close, Yongsha rose by 13 yuan, Meiya was better by 170 yuan, and the three small stocks such as Jingfu were not as good. Compared with the previous examination, the less popular small and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks all made slight progress.</p>

Except for Yisha, which had a small number of transactions, the rest were all indicative prices. Yisha first saw a low price of 8,100 yuan and rebounded slightly at the close. Compared with the previous close, Yisha, British Alliance, and Deying all fell slightly, the paper industry rose slightly, and the rest were flat and unchanged.</p>
<p>Decline in the Bond Market</p>

In the afternoon, the bulls bought up, making 520,000 yuan, which was 20,000 yuan better than the previous day. The miscellaneous 120th also brought up 120,000 yuan. The rest of the semi-gloss and 150th gloss were all called for the original disk of the previous day, and there was no transaction. Factory-managed silk goods were all hovering on the tired road, and the transaction was light and difficult to improve. Huajin crepe had sales from out-of-town merchants, but they were unwilling to bid. There were many holders, and all kinds of people accommodated the transaction, so the selling price was not good.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Issue of Spring Import Cotton: Estimated World Cotton Production <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to cotton industry authorities, the American cotton stored in the private textile mills in the city can cope until February next year. Regarding the American cotton needed after that, it is rumored that recently, foreign foreign firms have been ordered to order it, and the total number has reached more than 100,000 bales, which can be shipped in January and February next year. At that time, if the foreign exchange application is not approved, it is planned to settle the exchange with US dollars. However, since the Central Bank announced that all designated foreign exchange banks should not pay for domestic transactions and rents in foreign currencies and that imports of cotton without approval should not be sold with foreign exchange, the contract for the recent order of 100,000 bales of American cotton by private textile mills from foreign foreign firms will have problems.</p>
<p>This measure of the bank is very beneficial to the production and sales of domestic cotton, and it is especially helpful to the cotton industry in the city. Afterwards, various manufacturers will have to purchase domestic cotton, and the price of domestic cotton can also be increased. According to the prediction of the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the output of domestic cotton next year can reach 10 million dans, but according to the current needs of textile factories nationwide, 8 million dans can cope.</p>
<p>American Cotton's Supply Cannot Meet Demand: The New Cotton Price Reached 40 Cents</p>
<p>The cotton production of various countries in the world is ranked first by the United States, second by India, and third by China. However, the production of the Soviet Union in recent years has also been quite impressive, but the figures have not yet been published. According to a recent private estimate in the United States, the harvest of new cotton this year can be 9,445,500 to 9,768,800 bales. According to the estimation of 45 brokers of the American Cotton Exchange, the harvest of this new cotton is roughly 9,564,000 bales. Because the purchase of American cotton from various countries is quite strong, the Washington Export Bank has asked the government to increase the loan to 400 million US dollars for shipment to Australia and Portugal. Spain has also recently established a 200 million yuan silver pass to prepare for the purchase of American cotton. India has recently restricted exports, and American cotton is almost in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The price is also gradually increasing. It is rumored that the price of new cotton, American farmers have insisted that it is 40 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the northern and southern markets received over 6,000 *shi* of rice. The market had been sluggish, and production areas were in dire straits. Shipping new *xian* and *jing* rice resulted in losses. As a result, arrivals were scarce, and shops took advantage to manipulate prices slightly. The market uniformly rose by one or two thousand *yuan*. The southern market was particularly brisk. If arrivals remain scarce, prices may continue to rise. Flour sales were lackluster, and the market remained sluggish. Wheat bran was stable. Quanzhou, Xinghua, Shantou, and Xiamen all purchased wheat. Qingdao continued to select white wheat. The Ningbo market wasn't a big buyer and supply and demand remained stable. High-grade wheat rose by two to three hundred *yuan*, while medium and lower grades remained steady. The supply of new soybeans continued, but sales were sluggish, causing a further drop of over a thousand *yuan*. Old soybeans fell slightly by four to five hundred *yuan*. After a sharp drop, arrivals of raw peanuts became scarce, and the market rebounded, rising by two to three thousand *yuan*. Oil shops were still eager to purchase. Summer consumption was high. Arrivals of oil from Qingdao were not strong. The demand for raw oil still exceeded supply, and prices rose by one to two thousand *yuan*.

<p>[Reuters, Denver, July 7th] According to a report by Mr. Panqi, director of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, to the American Petroleum Institute, current U.S. oil exports are 350,000 barrels per day. This will increase to a peak of 400,000 barrels per day by 1948, after which it will gradually decrease to about 180,000 barrels per day by 1950. However, domestic consumption of major petroleum products will increase sharply that year.</p>

<p>Chemical raw materials continue to fall due to high arrivals and weak sales. According to a certain factory, due to various factors, finished products cannot be exported. In addition, the hot weather has caused factories to shut down, so there is no demand for raw materials, resulting in a sharp decline.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Sugar Merchants are also Allowed to Apply; The Ninth Period of Sugar Allocation Closes Tomorrow; Prices are the Same as Last Period; Supervision Will Be Increased <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to suppress sugar prices so that the general public can buy sugar at affordable prices, the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to directly allocate Taiwan medium-grade sugar starting from the seventh period. However, the general public still did not benefit. It is said that unscrupulous merchants engaged in back door deals with the allocated low-priced sugar, making huge profits in a single transaction, which is regrettable. The ninth period of sugar allocation began accepting applications yesterday and will close tomorrow. It is said that the allocation method has been changed, so that in addition to members of the South Goods and Tea Food Industry Association, members of the Sugar Merchants Association will also be included, in order to be more widespread than before. The allocation price will be the same as the eighth period.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter asked Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau about the fact that ordinary citizens cannot buy sugar at affordable prices, asking whether the bureau would take effective measures to address this. He replied that so far, no concrete evidence of complaints has been received, so the matter is still under investigation. However, it is reported that starting with the ninth period of sugar allocation, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to strengthen the monitoring of the sales situation of each allocated South Goods store, will consult with various veterans' youth corps for cooperation. At that time, a youth corps member will be stationed in front of each store to monitor and prevent abuses. At the same time, if citizens discover that any of the allocated South Goods stores refuse to sell sugar, they are encouraged to report the facts to the Social Affairs Bureau or the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to clarify the process of allocating affordable sugar in this city during the seventh and eighth periods by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, this reporter visited the person in charge of the company yesterday. He reported that the process of allocating sugar during the seventh and eighth periods was as follows: The seventh period of sugar allocation was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on July 26. On July 27, the South Goods and Tea Food Industry Associations paid Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Shipments began on July 29 and were cleared on July 31. On August 1, Taiwan Sugar Corporation publicly announced the addresses and purchase quantities of each merchant. A total of 11,766 bags were allocated, and the allocated price was 74,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*. The price for whole bags was 81,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*, and the retail price was 860 *yuan* per *shi jin*. A total of 15,378 bags were allocated in the eighth period, with an allocated price of 70,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*. The price for whole bags was 77,000 *yuan* per 100 *shi jin*, and the retail price was 820 *yuan* per *shi jin*. The allocation was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on August 2, payments were made on August 3, shipments began on August 5, and all shipments were completed on August 7.</p>
<p>Southern Goods Industry Asks to Increase Profits</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the South Goods industry of this city hosted the press at the Atlantic Restaurant. Yu Rupin, the chairman of the association, reported on the allocation of sugar, saying that although the allocated sugar could yield a profit of about 10,000 *yuan* per *dan* based on cost, the actual losses from transportation, storage rent, taxes, packaging, weight differences, weighing, and retail breakdown amounted to 14,000 to 15,000 *yuan*. Therefore, selling at the limited price would not only deprive the industry of profits but also cause significant losses. Therefore, the association, in order to consider the hardships of members' losses, plans to ask the authorities to pay attention to the legal profits that should be obtained.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Publishing and Air Mail <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Words of Warning</p>
<p>It is not easy to publish a periodical now. Ordinary periodicals, apart from popular square weekly newspapers, are difficult to maintain economically, because the maintenance of periodicals depends on sales, and most current sales are limited by region. For example, periodicals published in Shanghai can now only be sold in Shanghai, or at most along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Other places cannot be sold due to transportation obstacles. According to the estimation of people with general distribution experience, if a periodical can sell 1,000 copies in Shanghai, it can sell 4,000 to 5,000 copies nationwide. If a publication can't be maintained by relying solely on sales in Shanghai, it can be maintained by relying on the whole country. Here, we can see very clearly that air mail has a major mission for promoting periodicals and spreading culture.</p>
<p>Recently, a person who signed himself "A Distressed Publisher" sent a letter to the editor of the publishing world, saying: "Believe it or not, it has been almost a year since the victory, but what is puzzling is the strict restrictions of the Shanghai Postal Administration on airmailing books and periodicals. According to the post office's regulations, only ordinary letters, daily newspapers, and weekly periodicals can be sent by air from Shanghai. All other books and periodicals, regardless of size, thickness, or importance, regardless of where they are sent, cannot be sent by air." Although the distributor cannot send the distributed periodicals to other places by air mail due to the post office's regulations, in fact, the periodical is quickly being sold in bookstores or newsstands in other places. This seems to prove that airmail is not absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of protecting my country's fragile publishing industry, I sincerely request two things from the postal authorities. First, please investigate whether there is any "smuggling" of periodicals by airmail. If there is, please strictly prevent it, "turning private into public," and openly accept the airmailing of periodicals. If there are not enough aviation tools, a suitable limit can be imposed on the quantity. Second, if there is no "smuggling," can the postal authorities consider relaxing the limits on the airmailing of various publications, because spreading the seeds of culture is also a work worth undertaking on the postal front.</p>
<h3 id="e111">China and the Post-War World <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Traditional First</p>
<p>Author: Sun Ke</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>Date: June, Year 35, Shanghai Edition</p>
<p>Pages: 170</p>
<p>Books on the issue of China's future can often be seen in bookstores lately. We think this is a gratifying phenomenon. What kind of China do we hope to succeed in after the war? This is a question that every Chinese person should ask. We cannot let this country evolve naturally in fact. We should also have theoretical research. This research can make everyone have a clear understanding of the future of the country. Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng, as a practical politician, makes a theoretical review of China's future, integrating his experience and theory, which is really commendable. We have recently read three of his works: (1) China's Future; (2) China and the Post-War World; (3) The Three Principles of the People and New China. These three books are all published by Commercial Press. They include Mr. Zhe-sheng's papers and speeches on the issue of China's future in recent years. "China's Future" has twenty-two articles, with two appendices. At the end of the book, there is a postscript by Mr. Wu Jingtai, which is closely related to Mr. Zhe-sheng's philosophy of life. "China and the Post-War World" has seventeen articles, with a postscript by Mr. Situ De at the end. "The Three Principles of the People and New China" also has seventeen articles, with three appendices: (1) The National Government's Outline for National Construction, (2) The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, and (3) The Principles of the First Phase of Economic Construction.</p>
<p>In Sun Guang-sheng's lectures, we cannot find emotional propaganda or abstract and empty slogans. He studies problems with the demeanor of a scholar. There are places where he defends his doctrine, but there is also serious self-criticism. For example, he said: "Now, after our review, we feel that in many places in the Premier's teachings, we have not done well. Because we have not done well, the difficulties of our country are increasing day by day, and the construction of the country is not easy to complete." He also said: "In the past, our party and government often had very good resolutions, but when they were issued, they could not be promoted after reaching the middle level. The middle and lower levels are irresponsible and cannot implement the execution of orders. Their work is all written reports. If things don't work, they stop or simply don't do them and put them aside. When the above urges or the deadline is up, they make a screen report… The central government relies on the provinces, the provinces rely on the counties, and layer by layer down, no one examines and corrects their mistakes. Everything is wrong on top of wrong, and the result is that politics makes no progress at all." These are all sharp words aimed at current malpractices.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhe-sheng's view on China's future can be represented by one sentence—"A Democratic China in a Democratic World." On the National Day of the 33rd year, he said: "The world is moving in the direction of democracy. Although the anti-democratic fascist violence has not been completely eliminated, this reactionary force cannot stop this huge current today." Therefore, in his view, the post-war world should be a democratic world. However, "to establish international democracy, there must be two minimum conditions: First, every nation must be allowed to determine its political form and organize its own life according to the will of its own people. Second, post-war international cooperation must allow all countries, large and small, to be equal. Without these two prerequisites, international democracy is out of the question." Here, he opposes Yale University professor Spykman's "new balance of power theory," because the essence of this balance of power theory is "to weigh everything in terms of one's own interests." When it is necessary to restrain A, one can certainly unite with B; when it is necessary to restrain B, one may as well turn around and unite with A. Can this method guarantee peace in the post-war world? No! Because this is a reprise of the theory of the Nazi German school of geopolitics. On the contrary, Mr. Sun hopes that after the war, the Allied countries of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can maintain unity forever and unreservedly apply the spirit of the Atlantic Charter to establish friendly relations with various countries in the Far East. Therefore, the post-war world must be built on two foundations: national equality and the universal happiness of mankind. Regarding the happiness of all mankind, two things must be done: First, universally improve the living standards of people in all countries; second, attach importance to the rationalization of both production and distribution to avoid unequal development and national plunder.</p>
<p>Regarding how to deal with Japan in order to create peace in the Far East, Mr. Sun argues that it is necessary to (1) completely destroy Japan's military institutions; (2) disarm Japan's industry. Regarding the complete destruction of Japan's military institutions, the first is to fundamentally eliminate Japan's militaristic education, and the second is to eliminate Japan's military cadres. Regarding the disarmament of Japan's industry, the first is to destroy Japan's remaining military industry, heavy industry, and machinery industry, and the second is to restrict Japan's light industry so that Japan has no opportunity to rearm. In terms of political system, he argues that it is necessary to abolish the Emperor, overthrow the Empire, and establish a truly democratic Japanese Republic.</p>
<p>How can we create a democratic China in a democratic world? In answering this question, Mr. Sun raised three more questions: (1) What kind of China can be considered democratic? (2) Under what conditions can this democratic China be established? (3) What procedures must be followed to realize this democratic China?</p>
<p>A so-called democratic country is a modern country that is "of the people, by the people, and for the people." Mr. Zhongshan said: "The meaning of this of the people, by the people, and for the people is that the country is owned by the people, politics is managed by the people, and the benefits are shared by the people." "The country is owned by the people" means that in this country, regardless of ethnic differences, all people are equal. This country does not belong to any one person or any one group of people, but is owned by all the people. The reason why they can jointly own this country is that, in the process of cultural development, various ethnic groups gradually assimilate and merge and have a common national consciousness. In a democratic country, each individual must maintain this common national consciousness. This is Mr. Zhongshan's nationalism. "Politics is managed by the people" means that the people have the right to jointly manage the country, and an effective government is generated from this people's power to execute their public will. This is Mr. Zhongshan's democracy. "Benefits are shared by the people." Here, on the one hand, the benefits that the people can share are increased through industrialization, and on the other hand, land equalization and capital regulation are used to ensure that the benefits are fairly distributed among the people. This is Mr. Zhongshan's people's livelihood. Therefore, according to Mr. Zhe-sheng's meaning, a democratic China is a China of the Three Principles of the People. However, everyone should not regard this Three Principles of the People as a doctrine unique to the Kuomintang, but as the highest principle that the Republic of China should jointly have in its cultural, political, and economic construction. In recent years, the Communist Party, the Kuomintang, and the Youth Party have all agreed on this point.</p>
<p>To establish this democratic China, Mr. Sun believes that there must be four minimum conditions: (1) legal guarantee of the people's basic freedoms; (2) legal existence of civil political groups; (3) absolute nationalization of the army's military power; (4) completeness of national administration.</p>
<p>As for how to realize this democratic China, Mr. Sun argues: "End the period of political tutelage early, convene the National Assembly, promulgate the constitution, reorganize the government, and implement constitutional government, so that all the people of the country can bear the responsibility of national affairs along the track of the rule of law." Many important issues in the implementation of constitutional government are detailed in Mr. Sun's book "The Three Principles of the People and New China," which will be omitted here.</p>
<p>China is part of the world. After the war, we certainly hope to have a democratic China, and at the same time, we also hope to have a democratic world. The whole world is a complete organism. China's realization of democracy depends on the international democratic spirit, and only with a democratic China can a perfect democratic world be established. Therefore, Mr. Sun said: "In the upsurge of national cultural construction, our task is to promote national culture... while also promoting great harmony and transforming the main factors of the world."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Review of the Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenda</p>
<p>Edited by Yang Jinghua et al., Published by Huan Cheng Publishing House, First Edition, February, Year 35</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has been won, and the rivers and mountains have been restored. However, the rivers and mountains of China have changed somewhat. It is no longer the image of mulberry leaves in the past. Mongolia has been cut off in the north, and Taiwan has been added in the south. The image has naturally changed. When we study geography, maps are the most necessary reference. Whether the map is drawn accurately will affect people's view of the country. During the War of Resistance and after the victory of the War of Resistance, there were many provincial maps of our country published by various bookstores. This year, Huan Cheng Publishing House published the "Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China." The drawing is more precise, and I will introduce it.</p>
<p>The terrain of the map uses contour lines and layered color grading. At a glance, you can know the elevation of various places, and add numbers to each famous mountain peak to show how much it exceeds sea level. Unfortunately, in this map, such as the altitude of Mount Song and the altitude of Mount Heng, etc., are still lacking.</p>
<p>The printing and binding of this map are better than other maps, and more maps of transportation, soil, terrain, water system, population, climate, temperature, cities, and products are added, which are very suitable for teaching. New geographical information, such as highways and railways, has also been added a lot. Although this map has been carefully planned by the editors, there are still many places to be discussed. Now, based on what I know, I provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The Xianggui Railway was opened to Laibin County in the 30th year. However, the end point of this map is still drawn to Liujiang County. See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications in April of the 35th year, and the second volume of geography for junior high schools approved by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>2. The Xukun Railway was opened to Qujing County in the 30th year, and then the Yunnan-Burma Railway tracks were rebuilt to Zhanyi County. But this map is missing. - See the same as above.</p>
<p>3. The Qian Gui Railway was opened to Dushan County in the 32nd year and reached Duyun County in the 33rd year, but the end point of this map is still drawn to Dushan. - See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>4. The Qijiang Railway from Jiangjin County in the southwest of Chongqing to Qijiang County is missing. - See the Dagong Bao on November 10, 34th year.</p>
<p>5. The railway from Xianyang County on the Longhai Railway through Jingyang County, Sanyuan County, Yaoxian County to Tongguan County. This map is missing. - See "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled and printed by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>6. The railway from Dongguan on the Tongpu Road through Qin County to Changzhi County is missing on this map. - See the same as above.</p>
<p>7. The railway from Shijiazhuang to Zhide County is also missing on this map. - See the same as above and the Geography Textbook of Chinese Geography Society issued by the Geography Society of China (edited by Tan Lian, seventh edition, April of the 30th year)</p>
<p>8. The Guisui Highway from Sansui County on the Xiangqian Highway through Tianzhu County, Jinping County into Xiang Province through Jing County, and to Guilin City in Guangxi Province. This map only has the Guilin Longsheng section in Guangxi Province. - See the second volume of geography for junior high schools approved by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>9. Huichuan County was established in the 33rd year, governing Guanbao Town, by dividing the boundaries of Lintao County, Weiyuan County, Kangle County, Longxi County, Tan County, and Min County in Gansu Province. This map is missing. See the article by Mr. Li Yunsheng in the June issue of Travel Magazine, Volume 20.</p>
<p>10. On the east bank of the Muluwusu River in the southern territory of Qinghai Province, there is Chengtuo Tusi, one of the 25 tribes of Yushu Tusi. Chengtuo County was added in the 26th year, governing Zhoujun. This map is missing. - See the National Administrative Region Brief Table compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on November 9, 27th year.</p>
<h3 id="e113">My Life <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— By Lao She</p>
<p>Published by Huiqun Publishing House, August 1946, Zhu Li</p>
<p>Everyone who has read Lao She's works probably has a feeling: there is deep irony in the lighthearted stories. If one cannot appreciate this poignant irony and treats his writing as a joke, then one truly fails to understand the author's intention. Ordinary people regard humor and satire as mere amusement, which not only wrongs the value of the works but also slanders the author's painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>Creating a typical character requires extracting specific traits from numerous concrete events, not arbitrarily sampling from them. Lao She's "My Life" depicts the life of a patrolman, a typical patrolman, not a patrolman with a specific name. After reading "My Life," I feel sympathy for these so-called dregs of society, but it also makes us think about a question: why does society have these dregs? Who makes them become dregs?</p>
<p>As a child, he had some schooling, although not much, enough to read "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and the like. Due to the limitations of the social environment, he could only learn a craft to make a living at first. He learned to be a paperhanger, which was quite popular at the time. Moreover, he understood human relationships and was willing to be subservient, so he smoothly completed his apprenticeship in three years. After completing his apprenticeship, he became a person of the streets, young, capable, and knowledgeable. He was very successful in his trade. However, misfortune came; his young wife ran away with someone else. Heartbroken, coupled with the gossip of others, he became depressed: he drank, smoked, and changed his profession. He changed his profession to become a patrolman. At that time, patrolmen and rickshaws were the two railway tracks arranged for the poor in big cities. Those who were illiterate and had no skills had to pull rickshaws, and those who had skills but could not earn a living had to become patrolmen. At that time, patrolmen earned six dollars a month and a uniform. It didn't take much connection to become a patrolman. A patrolman who was law-abiding, regardless of winter or summer, regardless of sunny or rainy days, would manage vehicles, horses, pedestrians, fights, and quarrels on the road. There was no "extra income," and he would earn six dollars a month. However, these six dollars were not easy to earn. Being on the streets all day long, one had to be eloquent, act according to circumstances, turn big problems into small ones, and small problems into nothing, so as not to cause trouble for the officials and to make everyone get by. Truth and falsehood were all considered skills. The patience and ability he learned when he was learning his craft allowed him to steadily earn six dollars a month. Soon, changes came; the "Great Qing Empire" was changed to the "Republic of China." He heard that "once the Republic is changed, everything will be managed by the people." However, he did not see the reality. He was promoted from a patrolman on the street to a third-class guard watching the door for officials. He felt that times had changed. The Republic was indeed free. In the Qing Dynasty, everything had a standard. Those who wore blue cloth gowns had to wear blue cloth gowns, even if they had money. Once the Republic came, there was freedom in the mansions. As long as you had money, you could wear whatever you wanted. Soon, he had a good opportunity to be a guard for Mr. Feng, acting as Mr. Feng's follower, with a horse to ride and a black woolen uniform to wear. He only stayed with Mr. Feng for three short months because Mr. Feng stepped down, and he was transferred to the General Bureau to work, and he even received a copper medal, as if he had made some contribution in the mansion. After working for ten years, he was promoted to first-class police, earning nine yuan a month. When he reached the age of forty, his luck came and he became a patrol leader. After being a patrol leader for two years, white hair appeared on his head; his son and daughter, who had no mother, had grown up. His son wanted to work and became a clerk; his daughter was given to a clerk. He himself wanted to be active outside and looked for opportunities with Mr. Feng again. The opportunity came, and the order was to be a guard captain. Because Mr. Feng was out of luck, he did not take office and was transferred back to the epidemic prevention office as a guard. As he got older, he also married a daughter-in-law. He thought he should keep a beard, so he kept a beard. However, the new Director-General of the General Bureau could not understand him. During the inspection, he discovered these old and decaying things and dismissed him. After being idle for half a year, he managed to get a job in Henan as a soldier in the Tax Evasion Suppression Team, and later he was promoted to platoon leader. His son had a grandson, but his son died. He had to take care of his young daughter-in-law and young grandson, and he could not find a job in his hometown, so he had to do odd jobs. He guarded empty houses, helped people sell vegetables, worked as a plasterer's helper, and helped people move... The old man in his fifties did the work of a young man in his twenties, with only thin porridge and corn bread in his stomach. Hunger and excessive hard work, as well as fifty years of experience, made him realize: "I have treated everyone well, I have no problems in my heart, so what else can I say? I am waiting to starve to death, and there will definitely be no coffin after my death, and my daughter-in-law and grandson will have to starve to death with me, so I have no choice but to do this! Who told me to be a patrolman! My eyes often turn black, and I seem to have touched death. Hmph! I still laugh, laugh at my lifetime of intelligence and ability, laugh at this extraordinarily unfair world, and hope that when I laugh to the last sound, this world will change!"</p>
<p>Lao She's description is very lighthearted. Those who only read the story think it is just a story, but when you taste it carefully, there is a heavy feeling. Is this narrow path the only way that society arranges for this lifetime?</p>
<p>Lao She did not answer this question. He only raised the question and also raised hope, "Hope that when I laugh to the last sound, this world will change!"</p>
<p>The subject matter Lao She used, in terms of time, is from the late Qing Dynasty to the present Republic of China; in terms of location, it is a simple northern ancient city; in terms of characters, it is kind people with pure nature and a bit of servility. The whole book is written in the first person, using his own mouth to tell his life, so it is named "My Life."</p>

<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Children:</p>
<p>History does not repeat itself, but rights and obligations must be circulated for you to enjoy and bear. My father once earnestly warned me, and now it is my turn to warn you. I only thought about work, work, but never thought about getting old, but looking back on the past, I unexpectedly know that my era is already far away.</p>
<p>You must understand my feelings. But what you understand is only from your perspective.</p>
<p>Children and I are inseparable. I cultivate with blood, and I nourish with sweat, but I never thought about harvesting. Children are my greatest hope and greatest sustenance, because the value of children in my life cannot be estimated.</p>
<p>Over the years, I worked day and night because I didn't want to disappoint you, nor did I want you to not get the enjoyment you deserve. There are many rich fathers in the world, and there are also many poor fathers, but their hearts are the same. They all cultivate their children with all their hearts and dedicate their whole lives to their children. For you, I don't want to say how much effort I have put in, because this is an inevitable responsibility, but I have indeed suffered many times of cold looks. For you, I have learned to tolerate.</p>
<p>Fathers cultivate children because not only are children their sons, but children are hope, and children are the future.</p>
<p>You children, just look at your own hope, your own future, and move forward. Your brave advancement is how you are encouraging your father. No matter how hard life is, fathers don't want to get rewards from their children. Fathers have never calculated for their children, although fathers often calculate for their children.</p>
<p>I also know how obedient you were when you were young. But when you grow up, you more or less regard my words as a burden. I am very happy that you have your own decisions, your own thoughts, and your own era, but I still say it because it can provide some of my experience. I believe you have great development, but I never hope that I will only shape my children into people like me. You must be a thousand times, ten thousand times greater than your father.</p>
<p>I can still work, and I will continue to work.</p>
<p>I want to manage you. I want to keep my eyes on you, and my heart beats with you, but I want you not to manage me, to forget me, and to work hard and bravely forward.</p>
<p>Life's experiences are bitter. Having experienced vicissitudes, I don't care about your material support. As long as you give me spiritual satisfaction and comfort, this is your greatest support for me.</p>
<p>Your life must bloom, and your life must bear fruit. My blood, my sweat, and my life are all permeated in your life, and my life will also be brilliant for a long time through your life!</p>

<h3 id="e115">Mrs. Li's Troubles <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Muyao</p>
<p>Mrs. Li has been very troubled these past two days. Let this be the proof: she hasn't gone to Grand Brightness Cinema for three whole days!</p>
<p>Mr. Li has been rushing home these past weeks with a flustered look on his face. His restless posture resembles a bear in a dragon costume. His fat, oily face has suddenly thinned, and his small eyes have sunken in half an inch deep. She knows that the stock market has been plummeting, and the "hat" (short selling) that Mr. Li snatched is about to be forced onto his own head. Because of this, Mr. Li's favorite braised pork knuckle had to be shelved in the cupboard untouched; no need to cook rice either, the nanny can temporarily borrow a few meals from Mrs. Wang next door. As for herself, a little milk and soda is enough.</p>
<p>Looking back to a year and a half ago when she just gave birth to Xiao Ling, they lived in that small room on Wuding Road. At that time, Mr. Li was still a clerk in some fake tax bureau, and she braved the wind and rain to squeeze in front of the Fook Hong rice store, reaching out her hand to snatch the rationed rice like a robbery. She was disheartened all day from carrying the rice and firewood; Xiao Ling also looked like a skinny monkey because she couldn't suck out any milk. It was only with great difficulty that Mr. Li hooked up with his director, borrowed some capital, and was introduced to the stock exchange to do some genuine buying and selling. Thanks to God's blessing, things actually went smoothly, and life gradually became more exquisite and beautiful! Alas, only a year and a half! Seeing this hard-earned family business—including a foreign house, three hundred mu of fertile land, a rickshaw, etc.—swaying in the wind and rain, how can Mrs. Li not be anxious!</p>
<p>She just put on a new summer dress made by Hongxiang. Staying at home all day is not an option; for someone with troubles, home seems to be a breeding ground for troubles. It's better to go out and relax. But where to go? Mrs. Li began to search for objects to clear away her troubles in her mind. Catching the 6:30 pm show at Grand Brightness would be perfect. The film is some Atlantic war film, but Mrs. Li gets nauseous at the sight of those repetitive men and women on the screen. Then, how about sitting and listening to music at the newly opened ×× Night Garden? Ah, no, sitting alone there is worse than lying at home. Moreover, the word "music" makes her head roar like a motor. Then, how about going to number 104 to see Mr. Li and inquire about today's news? But that won't work either: is he even there? Even if he is, that gloomy face is like it's pasted right in front of her; she's really a bit afraid. What to do? Even the Great Shanghai that she's always been fascinated with doesn't have a place for her to go! Then, she might as well go to Mrs. Dong's house to play four rounds of mahjong, but each "Bamboo," "Sticks," and "Characters" tile feels like it has thorns; how can her pair of delicate, tapered hands dare to touch them! Oh, mentioning Mrs. Dong couldn't help but remind her of a conversation last night. Mrs. Dong burst into the house with a gust of fragrant powder, running and jumping, shouting:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Li, you haven't come to play mahjong for two days, what's up? Come on, let's play four rounds."</p>
<p>"Well, I, I'm not in the mood at all!"</p>
<p>"Look at your frowning face, haha! Is Mr. Li messing around outside again, is it?"</p>
<p>"No… it's not that!"</p>
<p>"Hey, don't hide it from me! Screw him, he can play and you can play too. If he spends 180,000 today, you spend 200,000 on him. Hmph, that's the way to deal with men. Come on, let's go…"</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The door opened with a creak, and the nanny came in carrying Xiao Ling. Xiao Ling ran up to her, babbling and opening her two round arms to ask her mother to hold her. Her little feet accidentally touched Mrs. Li's Cheviot tweed coat. She quickly took a step back and patted Xiao Ling's plump, adorable face. Xiao Ling, not getting her expected desire, dropped her little arms, widened her round eyes, and shrank her little mouth, as if she was ready to burst into tears at any moment. Mrs. Li hurriedly turned around and said softly:</p>
<p>"Wang Ma, take her out to play."</p>
<p>The shadow of dusk gently covered the window hole like a large wing. The cool wind of early summer jumped in from the window, like an uninvited guest wanting to give the host a shock. Mrs. Li subconsciously closed the window. The sharp sound of the radio drifted from not far away, mixed with the sound of cars speeding on the road, bringing a kind of emptiness and hasty sadness to the dusk. Mrs. Li really wanted to be happy, but she unconsciously took off her coat and threw it on the bed, collapsing onto the sofa and falling into deep thought…</p>
<p>…Everything was silent! Everything went black! Her body rose up step by step like sitting in a hoist bucket, up, up, up, and suddenly, she fell onto the floor as if shocked from the air. Just as Mrs. Li was about to touch her heart and sigh, the door slid open halfway, and a dark shadow squeezed in. Gradually, gradually it became bigger, taller! Just like that terrifying head in "Phantom of the Opera." Mrs. Li raised her face, desperately trying to call Wang Ma, but her mouth was blocked by a wet cotton swab. Her body seemed to be getting tighter and tighter by the black shadow, almost unable to breathe. She fell! She fell! Mrs. Li clenched her fist, wanting to reject and push the black shadow that was pressing on her, so she bravely opened her eyes. The room was brightly lit, and she saw a disheveled head of hair, bloodshot eyes, and a pale face… How strange this face is! Hey, how familiar it is! She scrutinized it carefully for a moment, oh, isn't this Mr. Li, who worries about her every minute and second! How did he turn into this after just one night of not seeing each other? She opened her arms, wanting to pounce on him, but Mr. Li slowly shook his head and slowly lowered it again. She panicked. Looking at the furnishings in the room, ah! The suits and cheongsams in the cabinet were scattered all over the floor, which were fine just now, what's going on?… Suddenly, a wisp of sadness like the sob emitted from a bowstring rang in her ear:</p>
<p>"Sufang, it's over! Everything is over!… Pack up now!… Let's go… Where's Xiao Ling!"</p>
<p>"…" Mrs. Li stood there blankly, black patches and sparks dancing in front of her eyes, the sound of snow, the sound of collapse, rolling in her ears… She, she fell forward weakly, and cried out with a "wa"…</p>
<p>"Madam, madam, wake up!" Wang Ma stood in front of the weeping Mrs. Li in her dreams, carrying Xiao Ling, opened her dull mouth, and looked at this mistress who had been melancholic for a few days, as if she wanted to ask:</p>
<p>"Fortunate madam, what else are you dissatisfied with?"</p>
<p>When Mrs. Li realized that she had gone through this nightmare, her heart twisted with sadness and pain.</p>
<p>"This is a premonition! This is a premonition…" she murmured, repeating the words.</p>
<p>It was completely dark outside the window. Her body was sticky, and her eyes were also blurry. She reached out her hand and wiped them with a handkerchief. When she stared at Xiao Ling's pair of round, surprised little eyes, she snatched her from Wang Ma's hands, hugged her tightly, as if afraid that someone would snatch her away, and kissed Xiao Ling's cheeks, forehead, mouth, and every part frantically…</p>
<h3 id="e116">Melancholy of the Jialing River <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>One of the Jialing River Scattered Tunes</p>
<p>The water of the Jialing River turns green and then yellow.</p>
<p>When the spring breeze turns the water of the Jialing River green, the summer rain brings a turbid yellow color to the Jialing River. Children growing up on the banks of the Jialing River all know when the water of the Jialing River will turn green and when the water of the Jialing River will become turbid mud. They can very familiarly point out what kind of boat is a coal boat and what kind of boat is a speedboat, because the colors and styles of the boats have been deeply imprinted in their hearts. However, they don't know more deeply that in the green and then yellow water of the Jialing River, there are buried infinite tears and melancholy.</p>
<p>When the spring water is green, the boats on the Jialing River gradually increase, white sails, melodious boatman songs, floating on the Jialing River. At this time, a small boat creaks out of the river bend. A young man holds the rudder and paddles hard. In the center of the small boat are two small baskets, filled with baked sesame cakes and a bowl of radish shreds mixed with soy sauce and chili. On a small wooden frame, there are many sesame cakes filled with radish shreds. A young woman sits beside the frame, looking melancholy.</p>
<p>They paddle their small boat close to the large wooden boat drifting down the river, pulling hard on the side of the large wooden boat.</p>
<p>"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, radish shred sesame cakes!" the young woman shouted with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>The passengers on the big boat all glanced at her with disdain. "Too unhygienic!" they all said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, sesame cakes with radish shreds!" Her voice gradually lowered, and the shadow of disappointment struck her heart.</p>
<p>"Let go! What are you always pulling for!" the boatmen cursed rudely. She had no choice but to let go, push the small boat away from the big boat, and let the young man in the back of the small boat paddle the small boat upstream, towards another wooden boat drifting down the river.</p>
<p>"Damn, stinky thing!" the boatmen still quietly added this sentence, although their boat had already drifted down, and the cool wind on the river would not bring this harsh curse back to her ears.</p>
<p>"Sir, want to eat sesame cakes? They're cooked, filled with radish shreds!" From the upper reaches of the river, the gloomy and melancholy voice floats again…</p>
<p>The summer sun turns the leaves of the trees green, but it turns the water of the Jialing River yellow. The river water rushes under the scorching sun, roaring, licking the rocks on the riverbank with its turbid yellow tongue, stirring up wild waves at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>At this time, the creaking small boat no longer comes out of the river bend, and the sad cry can no longer be heard. The young man picks up his simple luggage and quietly walks out of the thatched cottage deep in the river bend, heading towards the road of life. The young woman leans against the crumbling earthen wall, silently watching the disappearing back in the distance, crystalline tears falling silently…</p>
<p>The water of the Jialing River turns green and then yellow, and the sound of the Jialing River is always so melancholy!</p>
<p>We want to promote world peace forever, so that all fathers in the world can be comforted.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Maiden (Selected World Famous Paintings) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— By Greuze (1725–1805)</p>
<p>Displayed at the National Gallery, London</p>
<p>Many artists and writers often lack a correct understanding and evaluation of their own works; Jean Baptiste Greuze is a very prominent example. He considered himself a history painter, and this self-misunderstanding led him to misfortune. Due to his painstaking research on customs and manners, he was elected as a member of the French Academy. Because he was slow to hand in his diploma painting, the academy finally had to prohibit him from exhibiting his works again until he handed in his diploma painting. In the end, he submitted his painting, which was a work that tried hard to prove that he was a history painter. As a result, it failed greatly and was even reprimanded by the president of the academy. At this time, Greuze had already accepted the ceremonial honor. From then on, he closed his door for many years and refused to exhibit his works.</p>
<p>This incident proves that if a person lacks understanding of himself, it is enough to affect his achievements. Greuze's achievements were his family life scenes, which were loved by a wide audience.</p>
<p>Due to his hard work, he accumulated a lot of wealth; however, he eventually squandered all his money again; in his later years, he could not help but request work that his physical strength could not handle. In 1805, he died in extreme poverty in La Ferte. "Maiden" shows Greuze's most pleasant style and is also his acclaimed work.—Cheng Lu附志.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Tan's Bamboo Carving <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shuangren</p>
<p>Carving is a branch of art, occupying a very important position in the history of fine arts. However, seal carving and bamboo carving are unique arts of our country. The author has a collection of bamboo and stone paintings (stone refers to books and stone rubbings); because of his love for bamboo and stone, he also developed a fondness for carving. Moreover, because it is better to rely on oneself than to ask others, I have tried my hand at carving, but I am ashamed that I have not yet reached the level of mastery, but I can barely be considered an initiate. Since the prevalence of seals, many specialized books recording stone carving have been published; daily and monthly publications also contain writings on the subject. However, there are hardly any works that record bamboo carving. There are only "Records of Bamboo Carvers" and "Biographies of Bamboo Carvers," which compile the biographies of bamboo carvers, providing brief accounts and artistic critiques, but never mention the methods of bamboo carving. I, despite my limited knowledge, dare to offer my humble opinion in this casual discussion, hoping it may serve as an introduction.</p>
<p>To carve bamboo, one must first collect good quality bamboo! The most suitable material is water-polished white bamboo, which is warm, smooth, and elegant. Stroking it morning and evening, it naturally matures over time, the bamboo green (bamboo skin) gradually turning to beeswax yellow, then from yellow to red; like playing with red and white Han jade, it slowly becomes transparent and red, arousing interest. Those who appreciate bamboo should never rub it with oil from their nose or cheeks! Although rubbing with oil makes it redden easily, it is different from natural reddening; the former has a blackish tinge, while the latter appears blood-red, the difference being significant. To make it redden naturally and quickly, there is also a method: it can be hung in a well-ventilated place, where the air movement allows it to gradually turn red. However, the bamboo object must be changed in position and direction from time to time, so that all sides are exposed to the wind equally. Otherwise, the side facing the wind will redden while the side facing away will remain pale, and the overall color will never be uniform. If you find the "wind blowing method" too slow, you can use the "oil soaking method," taking good quality vegetable oil or peanut oil, boiling it thoroughly, letting it cool, and then applying it to the bamboo surface, which will redden more easily. Each time after soaking in oil, the excess must be wiped clean! Otherwise, it will easily develop mold, especially during the plum rain season. It is better to carve bamboo after it has reddened, as it is more refined than newly cut bamboo, which is full of fiery energy. However, the disadvantage of bamboo treated with the oil soaking method is that the bamboo fibers (the fine fibers inside the bamboo) are softened by the oil penetrating into the core, making it easy to "slip the knife" when carving.</p>
<p>When selecting water-polished white bamboo, the following should be noted: (1) The bamboo green should be even and smooth; (2) the bamboo fibers should be fine and without varying depths; (3) avoid cracks (it is best to buy more bamboo material in advance and, after one or two years, inspect it for cracks, which indicates suitability. If you buy and use it immediately from the store, you will often encounter newly cut material that will crack immediately after the onset of the mold season); (4) thick and large material is preferred; (5) neither the bamboo green nor the bamboo yellow (bamboo flesh) should have stains or black spots; (6) carefully check the bamboo for small holes. If there are holes, it is a sign of internal woodworms. Immediately isolate it from other bamboo to prevent infection, which will lead to all the bamboo being infested (any bamboo object with tiny bamboo powder is sure to have woodworm holes).</p>
<p>Stationery items such as pen holders, poem containers, armrests, and ink beds are mostly made of water-polished white bamboo because white bamboo is available in large sizes, allowing for easy selection. For fan bones, tobacco pipes, walking sticks, xiao flutes, and dizi flutes, the material selection is wider, such as mottled bamboo, plum bamboo, chicken-wire bamboo, peach-skin bamboo, and palm bamboo. Among these, fan bones have the widest range of materials. Taking square bamboo for fan bones is particularly valuable, as its surface is flat and even, and it does not arch; when it turns beeswax yellow, it resembles blood-colored ivory, making it very lovable. Some imitations of square bamboo are made by vertically cutting and selecting from large bamboo. Thick bamboo with a large diameter can be split into narrow strips without any visible curvature.</p>
<p>Carving bamboo is more valuable if famous artists create the calligraphy and paintings, or if rubbings of inscriptions on metal and stone are used, as these are extremely antique and unadorned. However, the calligraphy and painting should be done directly on the bamboo surface! If paper is used as a draft, pasting it onto the bamboo before carving will inevitably lead to distortion. However, bamboo is smooth and not easy to take ink, so you can apply a thin layer of tooth powder or cosmetic powder, which allows you to apply the brush as desired and transfer the image as you like. This refers to the bamboo yellow that has been skinned. If writing or painting on the bamboo skin, simply wipe off the oil.</p>
<p>When practicing bamboo carving, first use inferior bamboo to carve and pick at lines, until you reach a level where the strokes are straight and vertical, and then practice turning and hooking. Only when you feel that you have mastered the use of your wrist and have full confidence can you formally carve bamboo.</p>
<p>There are different methods of carving: yin carving (like white text in seals), yang carving (like red text in seals), and skin carving (also known as "leaving green," which leaves the bamboo green as the yang carved calligraphy and painting). The most striking and eye-catching is "scorched earth leaving green," where, except for the yang carved calligraphy and painting, the rest is dyed a deep color to make it scorched yellow, further highlighting the light and dark contrasting patterns and background, which is very beautiful. However, only the famous artist Zhang Zhiyu in Peiping (Beijing) can do this, and he has now passed it on to outstanding disciples. Few bamboo carvers in the South are capable of this.</p>
<p>To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools! The main tool for bamboo carving is a knife (sometimes a needle is also needed). If the bamboo carving knife does not feel comfortable in the hand, it will greatly affect the work. Among the ready-made bamboo carving knives on the market, those made by Wang Mazi Iron Shop in Peiping are the best, but even they are not perfect. It is better to make your own! The best material is the elastic strip from the inside of a clock or watch. This strip is made of pure steel; take a section of it (not too long, otherwise it will be difficult to exert force when carving), and tightly bind it to a bamboo handle (split a small section of bamboo and attach the knife to make a handle), and then it can be used. If you are carving small characters like fly heads, you should use a steel needle! For convenience, you can also use a sewing needle, preferably a German one. For extremely small cursive script, you can apply ink to the black bamboo surface and then use a steel needle to carve it; no eyesight is needed, it all depends on the skilled technique of the fingers.</p>
<p>Before carving, wrap the entire bamboo with mulberry paper (other paper is also acceptable)! When you want to carve a certain area, tear off the paper from that area. Otherwise, inadvertently, the calligraphy and painting may be rubbed off by your fingers, or become blurred and lose their original charm.</p>
<p>Use both finger and wrist strength when carving, but do not exert too much force; it should be soft yet firm, firm yet soft, able to release and retain, wanting to remove but hesitating to leave, so as to avoid slipping the knife, and it will not be distorted, and will be consistent with the original calligraphy and painting. When moving the knife, whether it is a stroke or a line, first cut off the upper and lower bamboo fibers. Then the left and right, and then repair the bottom. The work of repairing the bottom is especially important, and the slightest negligence will blemish the jade and ruin the whole effort.</p>
<p>There are various carving methods: deep carving, shallow carving, deep and shallow carving, flat-bottom carving, and angled-bottom carving. Deep and shallow carving are easy to understand, so I will not explain them. Deep and shallow carving involves making certain parts of a picture or character deeper or shallower, as appropriate, which is very beautiful. Flat-bottom carving makes the background flat and smooth, without any unevenness, which is very beautiful. Angled-bottom carving means that the edges of the yin-carved characters are all beveled. The former gives a sense of neatness, while the latter, due to the reflection of the beveled surface, displays the brushstrokes and knife work, making it particularly eye-catching. Therefore, when carving landscapes, flowers, and birds, one should consider the situation and use either flat-bottom or angled-bottom carving. Rocks and mountains are generally suitable for angled carving, while smoky clouds are suitable for flat carving. The outlines should be slightly deeper, while waterfalls and rivers should be slightly shallower. Understand this spiritually, it depends on the individual, and skill comes from practice. These are all things that can be understood intuitively, and cannot be specified in words.</p>
<p>There are also various types of backgrounds for yang carving: jujube skin background, walnut background, the two being the same except that the former is less bumpy. Sand background is like spreading powder, mat background, horsetail background as the name suggests. In short, to put it all together, there are hemp backgrounds and smooth backgrounds.</p>
<p>After the bamboo carving is completed, it should be lubricated all over with pine seed oil or walnut oil, which can both cover up the fiery energy of the newly carved work and prevent it from accumulating dirt and dust. This is a small matter, but it is of great use.</p>
<p>To store bamboo carvings, wrap them in newspapers! Because the lead characters on the newspaper are printed with ink, which can prevent woodworms. Alternatively, place a few naphthalene mothballs inside the bamboo object's wrapping, which has the same effect. Do not use Three Kingdoms camphor, as it is too drying and can reduce the natural luster of the bamboo surface.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Random Talks About Smoking <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Here are some common knowledge and anecdotes about cigarettes, I hope you can take the time of smoking a cigarette to finish reading it.</p>
<p>Strolling down the street, the cigarette shops display colorful cigarettes. The beautiful decorations, coupled with the trademarks of American products such as Camel, Philip Morris, etc., will tempt you to linger for a while. Even if you are not an avid smoker, you may touch your purse.</p>
<p>The import of cigarettes into China began in 1890. At that time, sales were limited to Shanghai. Two years later, it spread throughout the country. In the past fifty years, sales have skyrocketed. Today, the consumption of cigarettes has reached an alarming level. When friends meet, they cannot help but take out a cigarette case and offer a cigarette. A cigarette is smoked when mentally depressed, a cigarette is smoked when tired from work, a cigarette is smoked after meals, a cigarette is smoked while defecating, and a cigarette is smoked when there is nothing to do. For editors and writers working late at night, cigarettes are even more a necessary raw material for producing "inspiration." Even ordinary people who don't usually smoke will imitate others by holding a cigarette in their mouths, surrounded by smoke, leisurely and content. Public entertainment venues such as theaters and dance halls, as well as toilet rooms in schools, organizations, and institutions, have become major bases for cigarette consumption. Some have calculated that in big cities, those who never smoke account for less than 5%; in remote rural areas, except for the elderly who still hold dry tobacco pipes or smoke water pipes, almost everyone has a cigarette in their hand.</p>
<p>The Origin of Smoking</p>
<p>Now, please light a cigarette and let me tell you some little stories about smoking first:</p>
<p>It is said that the origin of smoking was purely accidental. In an ancient European festival, a priest who sacrificed to the gods accidentally inhaled a mouthful of smoke and felt a stimulating strange smell. He told the general public, who believed that this was God's will, so priests included smoking as one of the rituals when performing religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Greeks invented smoke baths, which were used to remove impurities. The barbaric Scythians also burned firewood to create smoke, dancing and singing in the smoke, taking it as a joy.</p>
<p>Long before the Americas were discovered, the locals already had the habit of smoking. In Central America, many ancient stone carvings depicting smoking relics can still be found.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the origin of smoking was originally a religious ritual, and later it was considered a medicine for treating diseases. The Frenchman Jean Nicot once said that smoking can cure syphilis, cough, asthma, headache, thyroid and other diseases. As for the invention of cigarettes, that was only about a hundred years ago. This is the origin of smoking.</p>
<p>Several Sections of "Smoking Studies"</p>
<p>Professor John Pallache, a professor at the University of Berlin, is a person who specializes in the study of "smoking and health." He believes that cigarettes contain many powerful toxins, such as nicotine, cymonia, cyanide, arsenic, etc. However, he does not oppose smoking, and he himself is a very avid smoker. However, he especially warned those who have a fondness for cigarettes not to smoke only the same kind of cigarettes, but must change them frequently, because the toxins contained in various cigarettes are not uniform. If they are changed frequently, the toxins will not accumulate more and more, affecting human health.</p>
<p>Do you like to smoke American cigarettes? Maybe you are holding a "Marlboro" or "Chesterfield" in your hand right now. But please forgive me for giving you a blunt piece of advice: According to Dr. Pallache's examination, American-made cigarettes contain the most toxins. Turkish cigarettes are second, and Chinese cigarettes are much better.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of smoking poisoning, according to the research of Drs. Bardenhauer, Nag, and Diggmann, the human body can absorb more than 60% of the tobacco in ordinary smoking. If the smoke is inhaled into the lungs, the human body can absorb up to 93% of the tobacco. Normally, one thousand cubic centimeters of tobacco contains about two to seven parts of tobacco. Those who smoke forty cigarettes a day have 224 parts of tobacco inhaled into their bodies. If a person who does not smoke is made to inhale 20 parts at once, it is already life-threatening.</p>
<p>The toxic effects of tobacco are manifested in the heart and blood vessels. Because tobacco can increase the blood pressure of smokers, causing pathological phenomena of arteriosclerosis, and even causing cardiomegaly. In addition, it can also stimulate the system, especially the digestive organs, and paralyze the central nervous system of the heart.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, for healthy people, smoking a few cigarettes does not cause much harm after all. But you cannot smoke too much. You must not exceed forty cigarettes a day no matter what. People with heart disease or lung disease should not smoke at all.</p>
<p>Talking About Careful Chewing</p>
<p>Open the cigarette case, and the neat cigarettes are exposed in front of you. The white paper wraps the golden tobacco leaves. It seems that it is very simple to manufacture, but in fact, it is very troublesome from cutting the tobacco leaves into shreds to rolling the shreds into cigarettes. If you don’t think it’s verbose, I would like to give a brief description of the cigarette manufacturing process:</p>
<p>The first step is leaf blending. After each mark of tobacco is handed over by the factory director, it is weighed by the deputy. For example, if 4,000 pounds of leaves are required, then forty rattan baskets with a capacity of 100 pounds are used. Each box contains various ingredients of tobacco leaves, which are then steamed soft by the leaf steaming truck. After steaming, they are transported by mountain movement to the butting department, and the cut leaf heads are handed over to the tobacco stem department. The tobacco leaves are put into spice barrels, mixed with spices, and weighed again in wooden boxes. After 24 hours, they are handed over to the tobacco cutting department for shredding, with a standard of three-quarters of a millimeter. High-quality tobacco is steamed once first, handed over to the leaf splitting department to remove the stems, and then put into the leaf steaming truck for re-steaming. Spices are added and put into boxes. After 20 hours, they are shredded and prepared for use. As for the tobacco stems, they must also be mixed with ingredients, rolled flat and shredded, and dried separately. They are passed through the screen powder truck to remove the long ones and put them into the tobacco drying tube and mixed into the tobacco shreds.</p>
<p>The dried tobacco shreds are stored in the tobacco shred room, which is equipped with hot air pipes and moisture pipes, which are used as needed. Then these tobacco shreds are handed over to the cigarette rolling truck, and thousands of cigarettes are rolled out. After rolling, they are given to the tin packaging room for packing, and then boxed, labeled, weighed, and sold.</p>
<p>The cigarette in your hand has been manufactured through such a complicated process. When you are "carefully chewing", have you ever thought about how difficult it is to come by?</p>
<p>Cigarette Cards</p>
<p>In the past, cigarette cases often contained cards for business promotion. It was produced in 1894, when Messrs. Wills in England invented putting small cards in the package. This small card was the world's first cigarette card, and the picture was of a hundred soldiers. Since then, everyone has scrambled to imitate, and cigarette cards have become popular. Some people who specialize in collecting such cards, like those stamp collectors, devote their lives to their work. In England, cards from decades ago can be worth dozens of pounds. One card tells the story of Winston Churchill escaping from Pretoria, printed on the back of Napoleon III's image, and is now considered extremely valuable. Many collectors are willing to buy that card at a huge price.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, there are specialized companies that buy cigarette cards, and their business is very developed. One company collects hundreds of thousands of different cards and hires three thousand collectors to collect them for him.</p>
<p>A few years ago, many people in China also collected portraits of characters from Investiture of the Gods or Journey to the West in cigarette cases. Especially children, they loved the cigarette cards the most.</p>
<p>A presumptuous suggestion: If cigarette cards use good books and teaching materials, it may not be a good education. Moreover, the effect must be great, I think.</p>
<p>Save the Cigarette Industry</p>
<p>I have written a lot in a disorganized manner, and finally I want to talk about China's current cigarette industry.</p>
<p>Amidst the influx of American goods, cigarettes are also one of the main items. Because Chinese people think that "imported goods must be new," and the price is not expensive, American cigarettes such as Camel, Philip Morris, Lucky Strike, and Raleigh have occupied most of the middle-class smokers. Although domestic cigarettes are cheaper, the difference is only one or two hundred yuan, which has obviously lost its appeal to customers. China's cigarette industry is already full of depression—no, it has reached the point of collapse.</p>
<p>Look at the news in the newspaper:——</p>
<p>"Recently, Guangzhou City has been flooded with duty-free foreign cigarettes, and the local cigarettes have been severely hit. More than 80 manufacturers have closed down, and more than 60 have gone bankrupt. The situation is serious. The number of cigarette workers who have lost their jobs has reached 30,000...."(Shen Bao, June 5)</p>
<p>"Because this factory has been oppressed by foreign goods, the silver has been very tight recently. In addition, the workers are demanding fees every day, which is difficult to maintain. We have no choice but to break the pot and announce the liquidation." (Announcement of the liquidation of accounts by the Star Cigarette Factory, July 17)</p>
<p>Look at the cigarette in your hand, is it also a foreign product? If so, please think about the tragic decline of China's tobacco industry! Please think about the future of China's national industry! Please think about the astronomical figures of the outflow of national interests! Please think about the countless unemployed workers who are struggling on the hunger line! Can you still bear to smoke foreign cigarettes? (Written on the eve of International Cigarette Festival)</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Difficulties of the Cigarette Industry: An Interview with Bauer <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Fu</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War, the British-American Tobacco Company, organized by foreign capital, was known for its superior production conditions, including strong capital, large scale, complete equipment, and abundant products. No wonder it firmly grasped the reins of China's cigarette industry. After this victory, although the British-American Tobacco Company did not lose these advantageous conditions, with the changes in the domestic economic environment, the business of this large foreign tobacco institution seemed to have become sluggish, no longer with the posture of its heyday. In order to understand the company's current situation, the reporter made a special trip to interview Mr. Bauer, the company's business manager. Mr. Bauer eloquently described the difficulties currently encountered by the company in four points to the reporter.</p>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<p>First, he raised the issue of obtaining cigarette raw materials. It is said that the main raw materials currently needed by the company are nothing more than four items: tobacco leaves, cigarette paper, wood, and various accessories used in cigarette machines. Speaking of tobacco leaves, the better quality ones are the American tobacco leaves produced in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces. These provinces were able to produce in large quantities before the war. After the outbreak of the war, railway transportation was cut off, and coal, fertilizer, and fresh tobacco seeds were all in short supply. As a result, the quality of tobacco leaf production was greatly reduced. Not only that, before the war, all legitimate tobacco merchants could directly go to the tobacco-producing areas and directly purchase tobacco leaves from the tobacco farmers. However, the war created opportunities for a generation of speculators. On the one hand, they bought from tobacco farmers at low prices, discouraging tobacco farmers from planting tobacco seeds again. On the other hand, they took advantage of the reduction in production to create opportunities for their monopoly manipulation. As a result, the market price of tobacco leaves has risen to a level that manufacturers cannot afford. To remedy these shortcomings, Mr. Bauer believes that efforts should be made to restore transportation and help tobacco farmers obtain coal, fertilizer, and fresh tobacco seeds. At the same time, legitimate tobacco merchants should be facilitated to directly purchase tobacco leaves from tobacco farmers, so that tobacco farmers can get reasonable prices to encourage them to increase production.</p>
<p>Paper Products</p>
<p>As for the various paper products used in the cigarette industry, Mr. Bauer believes that there are quite a few types. However, domestic products are really not easy to find. And all countries in the world are also experiencing shortages. Wood is mostly used for cigarette packaging. The current supply is very small, and the price is surprisingly high. As for the problem of obtaining cigarette machine parts, it is even more urgent at present. It is said that the machines of the company's various factories have suffered extremely heavy depreciation and wear and tear during the enemy's occupation. A large number of machine parts are needed to supplement the repair in order to restore the production efficiency of the pre-war heyday. However, most of these accessories depend on foreign countries. The delay in the arrival of accessories has invisibly delayed the restoration of production efficiency.</p>
<p>Production</p>
<p>The second difficulty, Mr. Bauer talked about the company's current production problems. It is said that it is unbearable to look back on the past! He listed three reasons: (1) Most of the factories are shut down or in a semi-shutdown state. It is said that the company's main factory in Hankou, as well as all the machines and equipment, have been destroyed by bombing. The Yingkou and Yingkou branch factories have all stopped production. The Tianjin and Qingdao branch factories are in a semi-shutdown state. This is because after the coastal and other transportation routes were completely cut off, the company was unable to supply the various branch factories with the urgently needed main raw materials, which led to this. The factory in Pudong, Shanghai, is also unable to start work under the current circumstances. The reason is that it is impossible to guarantee a continuous supply of coal energy, and even if there is, the price of this coal will be too high for the company to afford.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>In addition, the various costs of transporting and relocating goods from Pudong to Puxi are even more alarming. Therefore, the Pudong factory is currently unable to produce under economic conditions. (2) Labor costs are too expensive. The company pays workers' wages every month according to the cost of living index. The cost of living index is rising day and night, and the company really feels unable to support it. (3) The price of raw materials is high and in short supply. Although the company is currently trying to replenish the various high-quality raw materials before the war, it cannot be done all at once at present, and has to mix in various ordinary-quality raw materials for supplementation. However, production efficiency has been greatly affected as a result. However, even for this ordinary raw material alone, the price is already expensive. Especially the transportation fee, which often exceeds the price of the raw material itself.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, Mr. Bauer said that their current production situation is completely uneconomical. Their current production policy is entirely for the welfare of their employees.</p>
<p>Tobacco Tax</p>
<p>The third difficulty that Mr. Bauer talked about is that the domestic taxation on raw materials and finished products is too heavy. As a result, the domestic cigarette industry has been defeated. And foreign cigarettes can sell well in the domestic market. It is said that the taxation methods for finished products are not designed closely enough. At the same time, the implementation of the tax regulations is not ideal. The tax standard is calculated based on the inflated wholesale market price. Taxpayers are also not fully aware of the methods used to calculate these market prices.</p>
<p>Distribution</p>
<p>The last difficulty, Mr. Bauer believes, is the distribution of finished products. He said that the current transportation situation is a complete mess! Taking the transportation between the two major commercial ports of Shanghai and Tianjin as an example, general manufacturers feel that they cannot obtain shipping space. This only creates opportunities for speculators. They try their best to engage in various improper activities to try to sell goods. As a result, no wonder consumers cannot buy cigarettes at reasonable prices. There is also the high soaring of black market interest rates, which makes it impossible for normal distribution agencies to conduct business. Finally, due to the imperfect taxation methods, legitimate manufacturers are naturally unwilling to use the loopholes in these tax regulations, resulting in illegal manufacturers trying their best to evade taxes, while legitimate manufacturers bear the heavy burden of tax rates in vain.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Foreign Cigarette Dumping: National Cigarette Industry Declines <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Jun</p>
<p>Now, when the bells of victory are ringing, our unexpectedly harvested national cigarette industry has unexpectedly turned to a declining downward path. All kinds of "American-equipped" cigarettes: Camel, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, Marlboro and other American-made famous cigarettes are almost imported duty-free at the same time as the American troops. When we, these victorious citizens, began to leisurely smoke cheap and good American cigarettes, our national cigarette industry was facing an unprecedented threat!</p>
<p>Following the military cigarettes, since the beginning of this year, the number of American-made cigarette imports, no matter how much it consumes our precious foreign exchange, has been increasing month by month! According to the standards of the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, the number of American cigarette imports from January to July this year is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Month Number of Cigarettes Imported</p>
<p>January 150,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>February 4,500,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>March 2,160,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>April 33,060,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>May 23,500,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>June 158,026,700 cigarettes</p>
<p>July 37,570,000 cigarettes</p>
<p>(Monday)</p>
<p>Total 357,966,700 cigarettes</p>
<p>In this way, the number of American cigarette imports has reached an alarming level! Due to time constraints, the total import figures for July are not yet available. However, according to rumors, the total number of American cigarettes imported in July is approximately equal to one-quarter of the total number of cigarettes produced by all Chinese and foreign cigarette factories in Shanghai! If this continues, the future of the national cigarette industry is really unthinkable.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Why Can't Domestic Cigarettes Sell Better Than Foreign Cigarettes? <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Why can foreign cigarettes sell so well in the domestic market? In short, they are cheap and good. Now almost everyone knows that the cost of living abroad is far cheaper than in China. In fact, not only that, foreign manufacturers are large in scale, have a long history, sophisticated technology, complete equipment, rich experience, and sufficient capital, which are all things that domestic factories cannot compare with. In fact, in today's China, with the civil war not yet stopped, transportation unable to recover, currency inflation, the cost of living rising day by day, and labor unrest occurring frequently, if the government does not take effective protective policies, it is not only the cigarette industry, but any national industry will not be able to survive.</p>
<p>Now, please compare the production costs of domestic and foreign cigarettes as follows:</p>
<p>The general American cigarettes sold on the market recently, with the most exquisite decorations, and the tobacco silk used is only slightly lower than the few best American cigarettes, such as Marlboro and Camel, are priced at only US$1.88 per thousand cigarettes, and US$94 per 50,000 cigarettes (the above is for delivery in New York). If delivered in Shanghai, the price per thousand cigarettes is US$2.06, and the price per 50,000 cigarettes is US$103. That is, according to the popular 50,000 cigarette packing in Shanghai, the price per box is only about 210,000 yuan in legal currency. If you add all kinds of taxes of about 247%, the price is about 740,000 yuan in legal currency.</p>
<p>Then, take the price of British cigarettes, which are quite similar in quality to the canned Three Castles cigarettes, for analysis: the price per box is about 400,000 yuan in legal currency (50,000 cigarettes per box), plus various taxes of 247%, totaling 1,390,000 yuan in legal currency. However, for domestic cigarettes in paper packaging, such as Beauty Brand, the price per 50,000 cigarettes is 1,300,000 yuan, and the difference in quality and decoration compared with this canned British cigarette is of course extremely large.</p>
<p>Further, if a Shanghai domestic cigarette factory wants to manufacture a cigarette with the same decoration quality as American-made Marlboro and Camel cigarettes, its cost must be as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Raw materials and decorations</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves 135 pounds (calculated at 2,000 yuan per pound) equals 270,000 yuan</p>
<p>Cigarette paper 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Steel refined paper 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>Trademark 45,000 yuan</p>
<p>Outer packaging transparent paper 70,000 yuan</p>
<p>Large cardboard box (strip box) 15,000 yuan</p>
<p>Outer sealing paper for large cardboard box 1,800 yuan</p>
<p>Wooden box 8,000 yuan</p>
<p>Equals 439,800 yuan</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing costs</p>
<p>Fuel 5,000 yuan</p>
<p>Electric power 420 yuan</p>
<p>Glue 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>Management fees 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Tobacco leaf tearing wages 8,000 yuan</p>
<p>Cigarette packaging wages 24,000 yuan</p>
<p>Equals 69,420 yuan</p>
<p>The total is 509,220 yuan</p>
<p>According to the current regulations on goods tax, cigarette tax must be 100% of the value, so if the factory price needs to be 510,000 yuan, a tax of 510,000 yuan must be paid. In other words, if the selling price of American cigarettes is 740,000 yuan, the selling price of domestic cigarettes (of the same quality) must be at least 1,020,000 yuan. The difference is as much as 280,000 yuan, but if you want the decoration to be exactly the same as American goods, it is technically impossible.</p>
<p>If domestic manufacturers cut prices to compete, each box will be sold at the same price as American goods, 740,000 yuan. According to the current tax system, each box should pay a tax of 344,200 yuan in legal currency (calculated based on "selling price = factory price + 100% goods tax + 15% freight"), and the factory will receive a net of 395,800 yuan in legal currency. If the cost per box is 510,000 yuan, each box will lose more than 110,000 yuan in legal currency.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the current import tax system for foreign cigarettes has not yet fully fulfilled the duties and functions of protecting tariffs. Under this tax system, the national cigarette industry will have no possibility of competing with foreign cigarettes.</p>
<p>Then, where does the total tax of 247% added to the various taxes on foreign cigarette imports come from?</p>
<p>The various taxes on American cigarette imports are as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo price (C.I.F) + 10% (all miscellaneous fees from strict transportation from the ship to the distributor)</p>
<p>Tariff 80% (cargo price + 10%)</p>
<p>The total various taxes paid = approximately 247% (cargo price)</p>
<p>In summary, we should know that the tax system for foreign cigarette imports is a combination of various parallel taxes. The domestic cigarette tax system initially seems to be more burdensome than foreign cigarettes, that is, 100% of the value is taxed (foreign cigarettes must be taxed 247% of the value). However, this tax system is a tax-on-tax system. Raw materials such as tobacco leaves in our cigarette factories have already been taxed before they are made into cigarettes (according to the current tobacco leaf tax, 30% of the value is levied on tobacco leaves planted in this country, and 41% of the value must be levied on imported tobacco leaves from foreign countries). None of the other raw materials are not taxed early, plus the business tax and stamp tax for each raw material, in total, each factory has already paid more than a dozen taxes before they are made into cigarettes. And the current goods tax is 100% of the value after these many taxes have been levied. Therefore, in fact, the amount of tax paid by domestic cigarettes is heavier than that of foreign cigarettes. According to the current method of taxing domestic cigarettes, foreign cigarettes should be taxed as follows to be fair:</p>
<p>(Imported cargo price + tariff) Tax 100% of the value</p>
<p>Although cigarettes are consumables, foreign countries do not levy as heavy taxes as China. For example, the United States does not tax tobacco leaves. Their manufacturers only pay cigarette tax; the British tax system only levies import tax on tobacco leaves; the British tax system only levies import tax on tobacco leaves, and does not tax cigarettes produced in their own country. And their cigarette export taxes are all tax-free. China charges tax on manufactured cigarettes, and tobacco leaves, whether they are domestically produced or imported, are all taxed.</p>
<p>Chinese national cigarette manufacturers should pay attention as soon as possible that they cannot survive independently. If they still cannot abandon their prejudices and form a strong joint operating organization to cope with the serious situation in the future, otherwise the foundation that has been worked hard for for several years today will eventually be completely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Talking About Tobacco From Past to Present <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Cigarettes can be said to be the most common pastime in the world. Chinese people, very early on, had the habit of smoking domestic tobacco such as green strips and leather silk. Holding a water pipe in their hands, casually talking with family members, relatives, and friends, accompanied by a cup of tea, was a symbol of the leisurely life of the old Chinese times. After that, with the opening of trade between China and foreign countries, cigarettes also came to China. In order to prevent leakage and restore the rights, the Chinese also widely planted tobacco domestically and set up factories to manufacture it. After twenty or thirty years of struggle, it has established a considerable scale in China, which is lagging behind in industry. If our country can be self-sufficient in the tobacco industry, it may also have a significant impact on China's economic life.</p>
<p>Now we will introduce some knowledge about tobacco in the following.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the history of tobacco. According to general saying, the habit of smoking tobacco,</p>
<h3 id="e124">Originated in the Americas <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>And then spread to all parts of the world. In November 1492, Columbus's expedition team arrived in Cuba and discovered that the local natives used a long pipe inserted in their mouths, and the other end burned a kind of grass, and sucked the smoke into their stomachs. After that, the American continent was gradually developed, and explorers gradually discovered that the habit of smoking tobacco was extremely common there, and its history was long, and it was almost impossible to trace back to what year and what day it began.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the English word for tobacco is Tobacco, but the origin of this word does not seem to originate from the original name of this plant. In the past, residents of Santo Domingo used a Y-shaped tube to smoke tobacco, with two ends plugged into the nostrils and the other end lit with tobacco. This tube was called Tabaco locally, and the English name for tobacco may have evolved from this word. However, some people also say that Mexico had previously called the plant tobacco Tabacco.</p>
<p>As for tobacco being brought to Europe, it was brought by Fernandez in 1558. He was a doctor.</p>
<p>King Philip II of Spain sent him to Mexico to investigate products. The first person to bring tobacco seeds to Europe was Nico, the French ambassador to Portugal. In order to commemorate his achievements, the scientific name of tobacco is called Nicotiana. At that time, people generally believed that tobacco had miraculous effects in treating diseases. The great British poet Spenser called tobacco "divine grass" in his poems. Later, with the advocacy of Lord Raleigh, the habit of smoking tobacco became popular among the courtiers of various European countries. In the mid-17th century, the sales of tobacco spread like wildfire, and it was almost a household item.</p>
<p>In order to increase the sales of tobacco, the business of planting tobacco leaves in various countries is expanding day by day. At present, the most famous tobacco-producing countries in the world are the United States and Turkey. In addition, countries in Central and South America, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and various parts of Southeast Asia also produce tobacco. In China, Henan and Guangxi are the most famous places for producing tobacco. The local climate and soil are suitable for planting tobacco. If scientific methods can be used to improve it in the future, there will definitely be a better harvest. This is something that domestic cigarette entrepreneurs should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Chemical Composition <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>As for the chemical composition of unfermented and fermented tobacco, there are slight differences in nature, which are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Unfermented Fermented</p>
<p>(Percentage) (Percentage)</p>
<p>Water 23.50 23.40</p>
<p>Ash 14.89 15.27</p>
<p>Nicotine 2.50 1.79</p>
<p>Nitric acid (N2O5) 1.89 1.79</p>
<p>Ammonia NH3 0.67 0.71</p>
<p>Other nitrogen compounds 12.19 13.31</p>
<p>Fiber 7.90 8.78</p>
<p>Starch material 3.20 3.36</p>
<p>Nitrogenous essence 29.39 27.99</p>
<p>Ether essence 3.87 3.42</p>
<p>The quality of tobacco is better the older it is. The longer the time, the more mellow and less fiery the tobacco taste. However, fermentation can also improve the taste of tobacco, and various spices can also be added. If the combination is appropriate, the taste can of course be more wonderful. In order to seek the best sales of domestic cigarettes, efforts must be made to achieve excellence in manufacturing, so that the tobacco taste is fragrant and the quality is consistent. This is really a matter that manufacturers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>In a world where commercial competition is very fierce, the survival of the fittest is still the most basic axiom. In order to preserve our country's cigarette market and to preserve the lifeline of our country's industry, Chinese manufacturers must catch up as soon as possible, especially for the Chinese people's preferences in tobacco taste, they must spend more effort, so that they can achieve the purpose of Chinese people smoking Chinese cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Addicted to Smoking <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>During the Spanish Civil War, Madrid was besieged for a very long time, and transportation to the outside world was completely cut off. The Spanish are addicted to smoking, and under such circumstances, the supply of tobacco has become a major problem. Anyone who has the habit of smoking cigarettes can imagine the suffering of the people of Madrid. At that time, several American reporters were specially authorized by the authorities to come to the city of Madrid. Their purpose was nothing more than to gather news, so they often walked on the streets. Soon they found that people were often following them, and they were greatly surprised, thinking that there were spies investigating their actions, but after a long time, the truth was finally revealed. It turned out that these people were waiting for the Americans to throw away the remaining cigarette butts, wanting to use them to get a puff!</p>
<h3 id="e127">Lord Raleigh <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The habit of smoking tobacco was completely unknown to Europeans before the 15th century. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England, he was a very prestigious figure in the court. One day, he somehow got some good tobacco, and sat alone in the room, smoking it greatly, looking very leisurely. At that time, a servant ran in from outside, fearing that the master had any instructions, and no one was serving him. But it was okay not to go in, but when he went in and saw the master's situation of swallowing clouds and spitting fog, it made him jump up, immediately turned around and ran away, and brought a bucket of water, and poured it straight on the master, constantly shouting: "No, no, the master's stomach is on fire..."</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's tobacco production in 1946 will reach 1.0025 billion pounds, which is less than before the war, but more than double that of 1945. From July of this year to July of next year, the world's tobacco leaf production will reach 6.654 billion pounds</p>

<h3 id="e130">In Commemoration of the August 8th Father's Day <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>

<p>— Kang Dun</p>
<p>Generally, fathers naturally hope their children will fulfill their filial duties. However, fathers themselves must constantly reflect on whether they have truly fulfilled their paternal duties. Here is a common example:</p>
<p>I have a female relative whom I hadn't seen in a long time. Seven or eight years ago, she married a man who was twenty years older than her. I asked her, "Is he a widower?" "No." "Then, with your talent and beauty, how could you marry a husband so much older?" "Speaking of this, I have to blame my father. My father is a businessman, and his marriage to my mother was originally very happy. But since my mother gave birth to my sister and me, I often saw my father mistreating my mother upon his return from indulging himself outside the home. If they disagreed, he would resort to physical violence. He also didn't care about our daughters' education, so I, a daughter from a middle-class family, dropped out of school early. Seeing all my father's faults and my mother's daily mental suffering, I resolved that if I married, I would only marry a man older than me, with a kind nature, who would allow me to take care of my mother in her old age. Although there were many suitors, I finally married this man who met my requirements eight years ago...I sacrificed myself and lowered my standards because my father failed to fully fulfill his duties as a husband, and to ensure my mother's happiness in her later years."</p>
<p>"Do you plan to do anything for Father's Day?"</p>
<p>"I don't plan to do anything. I only have one hope: that fathers will not repeat the mistakes of my father."</p>
<p>She then told me about her friend's father, how he loved his daughter and treated his wife well, describing it so vividly that it almost brought me to tears.</p>
<p>I believe all human relationships should be reciprocal. The kind of one-sided filial piety shown by Yu Shun to his parents is truly rare.</p>
<p>In a society like Shanghai, with its extreme extravagance and frivolity, men always hope that women will be "virtuous wives and good mothers" and that children will be "filial sons and virtuous daughters," yet they don't restrain themselves from being "loyal husbands and benevolent fathers." How can children wholeheartedly celebrate this "Father's Day" without any regrets?</p>
<h3 id="e132">Father's Day, Father Anxious <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Cha</p>
<p>August 8th is Father's Day.</p>
<p>As a father, one has to rack one's brains over the children's education expenses. Relatives and friends congratulate you on having a family, truly a joy of family life. But, "raising without teaching is the father's fault," August will pass in the blink of an eye, and school will start again. Where will one find such a large sum for tuition and fees?</p>
<p>Father's Day, father anxious!</p>
<p>"Everyone has a father, everyone should commemorate Father's Day; commemorating one's father is the starting point of being a person." This is the slogan revealed by the Father's Day Promotion Committee.</p>
<p>I wonder what the children of traitors think when they see this?</p>
<p>It's like when the presiding judge sentenced Wang Wen-ti, he earnestly advised him, "You should learn from the first half of your father's life, but never follow the second half."</p>
<p>If Father's Day can make people reflect on themselves, that is the most noble meaning of Father's Day.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Psychology of Shanghai People <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Lu</p>
<p>—Starting with the "Charity Dance"—</p>
<p>After the "charity dance," the North Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has another method of electing a "Miss Shanghai" to help with disaster relief. For the "lives" of the three million refugees in North Jiangsu, we naturally strongly support the methods used by the gentlemen of the relief association after racking their brains, as long as they can raise more money and save more lives. There is nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the "dancing girl" charity dance and the election of "Miss Shanghai," we can't help but think about "the psychology of Shanghai people." Why use these two "grand events" for this disaster relief instead of charity sales of calligraphy and paintings by famous people, ancient and modern? It is obvious that this is for the sake of the psychology of Shanghai people. In fact, one cannot deny their cleverness and hard work.</p>
<p>Shanghai people are ultimately the most clever and realistic. They like to do things that achieve two goals at once, gaining both fame and profit. They prefer to enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. They are determined not to spend money for nothing; they must receive a corresponding return for their money. Previous charity performances and charity fees had advertisements that said: "Not only can you feast your eyes, but it is also a disaster relief good deed, achieving two things at once, why not do it! Come and enjoy!" This charity dance did not have a similar advertisement, but it can be drafted as follows: "Not only can you embrace a slender waist, but it is also a beautiful disaster relief good deed..." Indeed, Shanghai people have grown up under this mask of "the drinker's heart is not in the wine."</p>
<p>Immediately following the "charity dance" was the "fraud of 700,000 yuan," which was a truly genuine "fraud." The "fraud disease" has recently become popular in Shanghai, spreading like an epidemic. It is both sad and lamentable, making people laugh and cry!</p>
<p>I remember one Mid-Autumn Festival evening after "August 13th," someone was "raising their head to look at the bright moon, lowering their head to eat mooncakes." Every time they took a bite of mooncake, they thought of a lost territory in the Northeast; after taking another bite, they thought of another lost territory. Finally, after eating the mooncake and wiping their mouth, they said, "Alas! Our great mulberry leaves will also be eaten up by silkworms!" I truly admire this person's good appetite and their ability to be leisurely in the midst of sorrow, which is incomprehensible and makes me prostrate myself in admiration.</p>
<p>Using money earned from merely satisfying personal desires to help with disaster relief is not a good method! Because giving sympathy and aid mixed with deep grief in happiness is morbid and untrue. At the same time, this kind of behavior that does not stem from the sympathy of human mutual aid is fragile and temporary. Their purpose is not disaster relief; they are just spending a little money to make themselves happy. They rarely know why people in North Jiangsu are displaced? They have long forgotten the serious disasters in Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. They are truly "unaware of the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin!"</p>
<p>Therefore, Shanghai people should quickly change this playful, morbid mentality completely, the sooner the better. At the same time, based on the natural instinct of human mutual aid, they should provide aid automatically and without expecting repayment, contributing their strength and money. Then, this method of using the happiness of a few people to earn money for disaster relief will no longer be valued, and we will no longer see the kind of disharmonious advertisement in the newspaper that says: "Dance one more dance, save one more life!"</p>
<p>Think about it, where and what kind of people would have the following letter?</p>
<h3 id="e134">Letter to Father Comrade <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Father Comrade ××:</p>
<p>We are clearly not satisfied with the family you lead! In terms of blood, you are our direct "parent," but in terms of the organization of the family, you are our public servant. Your service to us is equal to our service to your third generation. Based on the interests of the entire family collective, we have very sufficient reasons and rights to ask you to note: we cannot and will not continue to remain silent about your incompetence and reaction. We have already decided by an absolute majority to abolish your leadership of the family from this day forward. In other words, internally you should hand over economic power, and externally you cannot represent our family! See the attached memorandum for detailed measures.</p>
<p>You must pay attention: "The minority obeys the majority, the individual obeys the organization!" We have the right to order you to accept decisions passed through democratic means! If this decision cannot be accepted, we will consider holding a family congress, which has the right to publicly try any reactionary elements who undermine family democracy!</p>
<p>You obviously do not understand our behavior in terms of "" and therefore interfere unreasonably. We have repeatedly protested strongly, please stop this unfriendly and hostile attitude and cancel the economic blockade! But you openly despise our protests. We believe that sexual behavior is purely a personal matter, and we have full rights to handle it. We believe that family finances should be open, and we have the joint right to dispose of your income; but due to your innate stubbornness and acquired backwardness, our rights and interests are not guaranteed! For the sake of human rights, we five siblings and your wife specially notify you jointly: please implement the measures proposed in the memorandum within forty-eight hours! We will try our best to implement these measures in a peaceful manner!</p>
<p>We will not consider renegotiating with you, because there are irreconcilable contradictions between you and us!</p>
<p>For the sake of family peace and unity, democracy and freedom, we announce: our "Siblings Family Protection Committee" will immediately exercise the ruling power of the family! Greetings to the liberation of the family! August 8th</p>

<p>— Luo Tingze</p>
<p>The American soldier, weary from the war and having stayed in Europe for thirty-two months, rushed to a nearby public telephone station as soon as he set foot on the territory of his homeland, excitedly calling his wife. At the same time, he was equally, perhaps even more, eager to hear his son's voice. When he left home, the child couldn't speak yet; now, according to his mother's letters, the child was three years old and learning to speak.</p>
<p>He waited for the connection with great tension, and then, very excitedly, he heard his wife's long-lost voice, which then stopped. After a long pause, he heard the muffled sound of his child picking up the phone. But nothing—the child didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"That's Papa, honey, you know?" his mother said. "Say 'Hello, Papa.'"</p>
<p>The child didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Say it! Hello," his mother urged.</p>
<p>But it remained quiet.</p>
<p>The child's mother tried again and again to get the child to say it with her, but she couldn't. So she tried one last trick to coax him to speak. "Honey, say 'Hello' to Papa. I'll buy you candy in return."</p>
<p>After a long time, the long-waiting Papa finally heard his child's one sentence: "Mommy, what kind of candy?"</p>
<h3 id="e136">Father (Part 1) <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>A True Story</p>
<p>I fell silent.</p>
<p>Alas! How could I answer?</p>
<p>Father continued to ask, "Liang, are you planning to go to school or go into business?"</p>
<p>It was still that earnest, sincere voice piercing straight into my heart.</p>
<p>Alas! Who would want to be a money-grubbing merchant?</p>
<p>Turning around, I saw my innocent and carefree younger siblings playing. Furthermore, I saw my loving mother's worried eyes, full of hope, watching me, waiting for my answer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered the difficulties of paying tuition. The hope of entering university grew dim. Finally, I blurted out these words from between my teeth: "Let's do business!"</p>
<p>In the deep of night, I hugged my pillow and wept.</p>
<p>However, I also realized my own selfishness. Father had put in so much effort to raise me, of course he hoped that I would help him support the family.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had suffered a lot for us, especially the embarrassing cold looks he received when borrowing money at the end of the semester. Whenever I thought of the difficulties Father had in raising tuition fees, the past appeared before my eyes like a silver screen.</p>
<p>The year before last, during a summer vacation, I followed Father to a car dealership. Father didn't tell me the reason for going there beforehand, and I didn't ask.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I wasn't interested in what the car dealership manager and Father were saying, I didn't hear everything, but I always remembered a few words.</p>
<p>That man pointed at me and said, "How is he doing in school?"</p>
<p>"Because he's still considered smart, I wanted him to graduate from middle school. I wanted to ask you to help..."</p>
<p>The man interrupted Father before he could finish speaking, "Let this kind of person go into business! There's no use in studying." Contempt and disdain overflowed in his words.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult to find a job these days..."</p>
<p>"I myself have been very short on money lately, and business isn't very good, so I can't..." A layer of somewhat mocking laughter floated on his face, and he muttered behind him, "If you can't afford to study, what's the point of letting him study? Trying to save face!"</p>
<p>I looked up at Father and saw him clenching his teeth.</p>
<p>Last year, Father was unemployed at home, but relying on his abilities, our family of nine did not go hungry. You must know that it is very difficult to gain a foothold in this world, especially for someone who is illiterate. But even though Father was illiterate, he supported this group who only knew how to open their mouths to eat.</p>
<p>It was also during the summer vacation, I think, that I was going to take the scholarship exam. Father tried his best to stop me. He said he would find a way to pay the tuition. In order not to make Father run around in the scorching sun, I finally joined the scholarship exam.</p>
<p>In the end, I failed!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh all day, but Father came to comfort me.</p>
<p>I realized the reason why Father stopped me. He knew I wouldn't pass, and he didn't want me to be hurt.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for his hard work.</p>
<p>Someone came to Father and said that he would be willing to provide Father with money. If Father could go to work for him, no, to become an "official," a puppet official, a lucrative position as a "puppet bureau chief" was waiting for him to take office.</p>
<p>Father refused immediately before the man could finish speaking.</p>
<p>Father said that if he did this kind of thing, although we would have tuition fees, we would not be able to gain a foothold in society in the future.</p>
<p>As for himself, he was absolutely unwilling to compromise, but he said that he would never let his children be called "the sons of traitors" no matter what.</p>
<p>Father said that even if our family was starving to death, we should not wave the white flag.</p>
<p>Later, on the day before school started, Father gave me money and ordered me to pay the tuition. He said, "Child, you have to work hard! Take this money to pay the tuition, remember! This money was earned by very legitimate means, and I can say that this money is very sacred."</p>
<p>I respectfully agreed and went to pack my school supplies, preparing to go to school. Just as I was about to leave, Father stopped me and said softly, "Child, you must listen to your mother, because this money was exchanged for your mother's only possession and her only beloved jewelry."</p>

<p>"There is a family after there is a country."</p>
<p>When commemorating "Father's Day," of course, we cannot forget the father who gave birth to and raised us.</p>
<p>However, for all descendants of the great Republic of China, in addition to having a father of their own, we must not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who created the Republic of China. He is the founding father of the Republic of China, and can also be said to be the father of every Chinese citizen. When we commemorate our own father, we must not forget the founding father's instructions. There is a family after there is a country. If we keep this sentence in mind, then the meaning of "Father's Day" is even greater.</p>
