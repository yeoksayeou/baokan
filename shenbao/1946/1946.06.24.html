<h3 id="c1">三人會議昨繼續進行　全盤檢討交通問題　鐵路綫共軍仍不肯撤退 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕今日為星期例假，參加軍事三人會之政府與中共代表於晨十時即先後馳往寗海路馬歇爾行館，靜候開會。馬使循例至軍中敎堂做禮拜後，旋遄返行館，會議遂於十時二十五分繼續舉行。聞今日會議，對恢復交通一項問題作全盤之檢討，會議時間長達二小時另二十五分，中間曾休息兩次，會議之結果未公布。據消息靈通者稱：今日會議，對拆除碉堡，統一路政路　各節，原則上雙方意見已無大出入，惟對撤退鐵路沿綫共軍一節，因事涉共軍駐區問題，雙方辯論甚為激烈。聞此事將於明日作專案討論，俟此一問題解決，方可獲得圓滿協議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕今晨舉行之軍事人會第二次會議，仍由馬歇爾將軍主席，出席之政府代表為交長兪大維，政府列席人員為交次凌鴻勛，及石志仁局長，白宗敢參事，國防部第一處長許朗軒，及郭汝槐，中共列席人員為滕代遠副參謀長，及黃逸峯等四人。聞凌次長曾携帶各鐵路被破壞待修之詳盡報吿及各種參考圖表統計資料多件，中共方而亦携有共軍佔領區內各路段現狀報吿多種。會議開始後，馬使對各路枕木，路軌，橋樑，涵洞，站房，工廠破壞之程序，極為注意，對各路沿綫雙方軍隊駐區距離等事，詢問尤詳，且不時起立環視室內臨時張掛之各種圖表，以資參攷。當其聞悉津浦隴海等路有被破壞至數十百次之多時，曾慨然作長　，若不勝惋惜然。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕聞周恩來與兪大維會於昨日午後三時許，先後至馬歇爾官邸訪晤馬使，對馬使公斷權，曁有關停戰復路整軍三項問題及共軍駐區問題，作會外商討，並交換意見。據悉：中共對馬使公斷權亦提出新辦法，聞中共僅以認美方代表有執行權及解釋權，對最後決定方式，仍主由三方代表議定，與政府主張最後決定方式取決於多數一點，有顯著之差別，如此事不能迅速解決，可能成為會議中之重要暗礁。據某中立人十談：中共旣一再讚揚馬使為最公正之調解人，並一再表示信賴馬使，欽佩馬使，即不應口是心非，而故意藉此一難題以遂行其邊談邊打之詭謀。</p>
<p>俞大維會後謁主席</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕今日三人小組會議散後，記者曾晤兪交長火維，於其私邸。兪氏以最輕快之步履躍出汽車，丰采洒脫狀甚愉快。記者以本日會議之重點，乃在「交通」，旋趨詢兪氏意見，兪氏稱：「汝僅以余之愉快態度報吿讀者，即可知會議之一斑矣。」繼笑謂「余從未有若今日之愉快者」最後並稱：「好消息於六月卅日可以發表。」聞余氏今竟日奔忙，會後曾兩謁主席，有所商討，按三人會議明日上午將續商交通問題，據悉，今日曾獲得部份協議</p>
<p>政府代表交換意見</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿二日電〕政府代表孫科·邵力子·吳鐵城·陳立夫·王世杰及張厲生等今晨舉行會議，討論中共代表周恩來提案內容，並交換意見。會後，當以原案呈交蔣主席。會中對於提案中第四點，即關於召開政治協商會議二次會議一點，予以保留，謂該一問題可於軍事問題解決後，事問題解決後，留待各黨討論之。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國防部發言人　斥中共建議　共軍一再破壞停戰令　今又節外生枝圖拖延 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕今日國防部發言人發表重要談話：歷述自本年一月十日第一次停戰協定命令發出後，及六月六日第二次停戰公吿發佈後，共軍一再破壞停戰命令，私自擴編部隊，襲擊國軍，破壞交通，攻擊城鎭，以及扣留或戕害政府及美方小組代表人員，一切違令背信，殘民以逞之事實，並駁斥中共於第三次停戰命令公布後，上主席書中所提之四項建議，認為背信，意圖節外生枝，蓄意拖延，尤其第四項更屬空洞，如主張在軍事衝突未停止前，以重開政治協商會議，改組政府等，將政治問題與停戰急務相提並論，其為延宕政策，彰彰　甚。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕國防部發言人頃談稱：本月廿一日，政府以最火之忍讓，於届滿十五日之停止追擊前進命令限期前，再度延長八日，此舉實乃再予共黨以醒覺機會，乃中共代表又致函政府代表，提出建議，倒置是非，橫生枝節，茲可以已往舉世共知之事實，證明共黨此舉，顯然缺乏誠意，意圖拖延。查中共代表團函稱：「政府方面所提整軍方案，竟完全出人意外，企圖將中共部隊在整軍期間，排出大城市及鐵路綫、以便消滅」等語。其用意所在，顯欲將其自日本投降後被共軍非法襲佔之各大城市及鐵路綫、永久佔據，造成割據之勢，不欲遵從政府調遣，不特破壞軍令政令之統一，即對雙方同意簽定之整軍方案基本原則，亦欲橫生阻撓，幷以「無從考慮」之堅決語氣，完全表現其無和平之誠意」，該函又稱：「倘冉不立即停戰，則人民塗炭，國家糜爛，慘淡前途，誠不堪設想」。設共方此意為發於至誠，則自本年一月十日以後，共產軍之擴編部隊，襲擊國軍，破壞交通，攻據城鎭，以及扣留或戕害政府及美方小組代表人員等一切違反停戰命令之事實，不知共方代表究將何以自解，即以最近之事實而論，自六月七日第二次宣佈停戰命令後，國軍除為自衛外，各部隊均確守原防，並無追擊及進攻之情形，而共產軍反而全面發動攻勢，例如在東北方面則襲佔扶餘，陶賴昭，拉法等處，冀東方面刻正向盧龍，灤縣以北地區大量集中武力，意國切斷北寗路交通，山西方面，則襲佔繹縣，朔縣·聞喜·山東方面，尤屬積極，津浦綫上，則襲佔德州，泰安·棗莊等地膠·濟綫上則襲佔明水，龍山，周村，張店，膠州，城陽等車站，並以十萬大軍圍困濟南，六萬大軍攻擊靑島之黃埠，白河水源圍　靑島，並繼續破壞華北各重要鐵路綫，例如平漢綫自元氏以南以迄於豐樂長達二百餘公里，均為共產軍佔據，不准修復，同蒲綫上之逆城聞喜段，聞喜史村段，均係最近共軍破壞·津浦綫上除濟南附近外，南自黨家莊以迄於徐州以北之利國驛，北自桑梓店，以迄於河北之滄縣，均為共軍分段破壞，迄今不能修復，膠濟綫自經交通部盡最大之努力搶修後，幾已全部通車，如最近共產軍為切斷靑濟間之交通。除將沿綫重要車站襲佔外，再度予以破壞，共產軍於第二次停戰令後，不特仍表演其襲佔城鐵，破壞交通之故技，且公然戕害政府小組人員雷奮强少校，及新鄉小組繙譯員郭子祺等，此均係目前之事實，共方代表所謂同意休戰，仍為企圖掩蓋其自由　　攻擊國軍而使國軍被其各側擊破之一貫技倆，再查中共代表於其建議書內所提之四項，仍不免背棄事實，意岡節外生枝，蓄意拖延。（未完待續）</p>

<p>鎮江車站上一幕悲壯激昂場面</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕馬叙倫等一行，已經由治安當局護送進城。馬等在車站　受難民質問，幸未發生意外事件，惟難民情緒甚為激昻，當局俟查明馬等身份之後，再定如何處理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕自稱人民代表之馬叙倫·包達三·陳震中·蕢延芳·胡子嬰·盛丕華·張銅伯·陳立復·閻寶航·雷潔瓊·吳耀宗等十餘人，今日由滬來京，自稱為上海五十餘人民團體代表，為反對內戰來京，向政府·中共·及馬帥請願，當車至鎭江時，因難胞尙不知馬等為自拉自唱之代表，鎭江車站即聚集數千蘇北難胞，派代表五人，要求三點：（一）請馬叙倫下車談話，（二）請馬氏聽難民報吿，蘇北共軍之暴行，並請轉達蔣主席及馬帥，送他們還鄕。是時馬叙倫諉稱：彼係代表上海人民去京，不允下車。是時曾有難民，並欲以身臥車道，懇請馬氏下車，幸車站人員婉為轉達，始能開車。馬等於七時抵京，甫抵站台，即有集散車站之蘇北難民，向馬等訴苦，並謂：「你們旣是人民代表，就請你們帶我們去見周恩來，請他答覆我們，恢復交通，停止衝突的問題。」馬以羣情激昻，無以應付，答以「余等係往謁蔣主席。」羣衆大呼「如不帶我們難民去見周恩來，就不是眞代表！」於是難民高呼：「我們不要民主騙子，我們老百姓和小學生不能一輩中做你們政治的賭本。」斯時，人聲鼎沸，人羣互為擠軋，乃有人佯呼「代表被打了。」唯當本報記者在車站之一會客室中，見到馬氏僅見其疲勞而已。旋有所謂代表中之閻寶航，於臨時搭起之桌上，揮動雙手演講，招徠羣衆，是時站上羣衆，已達數千，每聞其自稱人民代表時，即高呼「取出證件來！」而白動糾織之難民代表、亦即提出要求多點如次：（一）要共軍撤川蘇北，（二）要共軍停止婦女肉體慰勞，（三）停止鬥爭，（四）不强抽壯丁，（五）要回家，要有保障，（六）停止血的鬥爭。又向民主同盟代表要求（一）不要做共產黨尾巴，（二）停止一切政團性的學校活動，（三）我們要讀書，（四）我們要和平統一，不要內亂。此時自稱人民代表之馬叙倫無辭以對，且不敢出見羣衆。此時難民於悲痛失望之餘，不免紛亂，故造成某三記者被誤打之不幸事件，　　數記者，曾往迎馬等，羣衆有所誤會，此亦表示羣情之難犯也。至夜十一時止，下關車站仍在僵持中，秩序則由路局憲警維持，此一幕「眞民主」「假民主」之鬥爭塲面，延至午夜始已。</p>

<h3 id="c20">美國務院發表　東北事變秘密文件　詳述一九三一年美外交活動情形　史汀生為當時國聯幕後强角色 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕國務院今日所發表關於一九三一年中國東北事變之秘密文件中宣露：當時之國務卿史汀生，曾不惜任何代價，與日本覓取和平相處。按史汀生於珍珠港事變發生時，係任陸軍部長。該文件中宣示，史汀生感覺日本於東北之行動，已難作「任何適當之調停」，但被以為中國對日之過度「仇視」，亦為造成東北事變之原因之一。彼並指責中國「亟欲使全世界之國家俱捲入漩渦，對日作戰」，文件中引載史汀生之語曰：「吾人當同情此事，但吾人不欲與日本作戰」。</p>
<p>該文件僅係包含東北事變最初之三個月日本於一九三一年九月十八日進襲東北，兩月以後，舊國聯理事會於巴黎二次開會，考慮事變之局勢，該文件中首次詳細宣示，史汀生於國聯之活動中，曾扮演强力之幕後角色，雖然此時美國尚並未參加國際聯盟。文件中宣示，史氏實「操縱」國聯關於東北事件之大部活動，但本身並不負責。史汀生並曾命當時之國際美國非正式聯絡代表查利大衛將軍，將國聯理事會主席法國代表白里安「攫住領口」，勿使國聯對日「操之過急」，彼恐國聯堅强之行動，將使日本「冒火」。</p>
<p>彼並反對對日經濟制裁，蓋此將為「對日作戰之前步」，彼認為必須阻止國聯勿派軍事調查團前往東北。史汀生告大衛稱：「吾人在東北惟一關心之事，即為阻止戰爭，中國與日本只要能用和平方式相商，其結果解決辦法若何，吾人並無所謂」。</p>
<p>文件宣示，史氏之勸告係受國聯理事會諸代表之鼓勵者。一九三一年末，中國政府官員責備美國「破壞」彼等認為原可獲得之國聯對日「嚴萬譴責」。文件中載稱：史汀生秘密與國聯「合作」，其程度遠超過美國人如獲知後所可能贊同者，史汀生不贊成國聯對日採取强硬行動，而主張由中日直接談判，日本復投票否決國聯促其談判，並立即將軍隊自東北撤退之建議，英國爰提議對日再作某種讓步。</p>
<p>史汀生曾設法安排與中立方面觀察家之直接談商，彼稱：「如日本拒絕，則當認彼為不合法，並於中國之有效抵制及世界各國之精神壓力下，使其感覺四面楚歌」。</p>
<p>今日發表之秘密文件中，有無數部分顯示對日本之同情，表示對彼侵略東北一事，頗為遺憾，並對中國政府對日抱怨所作之「永無休止之長篇大論」，甚感不耐。</p>
<p>日本侵入東北後一個月，其時任副國務卿之威廉加賽告日本大使稱：「若以為吾人係希望日人退出東北，此實屬完全錯誤。……吾人當然不應促使或甚至建議日本完全退出東北，因日軍之在東北，係根據條約之規定者，此乃極為顯見之事。</p>
<p>加賽並曾告日本大使曰，美國對於東北事件之意見，頗為「抑制」，蓋極多人深知「東北之日本人曾忍受極多且現亦繼續存在之煩惱也」。</p>
<p>此秘密文件中所宣示史汀生於東北事變中之所作所為，與彼自著之「遠東之危機」一書中所述者，大相逕庭。在彼所作之此書中，史汀生自叙曾努力使英國政府對日採取强硬手段，但結果由於英方回答之冷淡，彼乃不得不將自己之計劃放棄。</p>

<h3 id="c21">締結遠東四强公約 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>自日寇屈膝降，受盟軍最高統帥管制以來，將近十個月了。盟國管制日本的目的：除解除日本的武裝外，並須改革日本政治的威脅。我們檢討麥帥管制日本的工作，在這十個月內，對於肅淸日本軍閥餘孽，根除人民的侵略思想，及改革日本的政治制度各方面，確有相當的成就。但是這種管制辦法，終非長久之計。美國國務院為遠東和平建立一個百年大計起見，乃擬就了一個中美英蘇四强解除日本武裝廿五年條約，通知中英蘇三國政府，作為將來遠東四强公約的張本。在遠東和會尚未召開的今日，美國提出這個四强公約的計劃，更加値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>據美國新聞處所發表的四强公約昔案全文，歸納起來，有下列要點：（一）設立四强管制委員會，以監督日本解除武裝及國內不設防；（二）將日本所有海陸空三軍全部解除武裝，並須解散帝國大本營及參謀本部，不許設有軍事機構及半軍事機構，禁止製造及輸入軍械，暨不得設立海陸空根據地；（三）日本如有破壞或違反此項條約之行動時，簽約各國均須立即在海陸空三方面，採取必要行動，加以制止；但須將所採取之措置，報告聯合國安全理事會；（四）條約有效期限定為廿五年，應於期滿前六個月內，召開四强會議，以决定此項條約有無修正或延長之必要。</p>
<p>從這四項要點看來，其性質與美國國務卿貝爾納斯在上次四國外長會議所提出的解除德國武裝廿五年條約，大體相同；其目的顯在防制侵略勢力的再起，而為遠東和平奠定鞏固的基礎。今日的遠東形勢，雖因日本的戰敗而改觀，但是展望將來，遠東和平能不能維持長久，其關鍵還在日本。我們對於日本。我們對於戰敗的日本，不容絲毫忽視。在表面上，日本朝野雖然忍受戰敗所引起的苦果，但是在他們內心之中，似乎迄今尚未承認戰敗，並堅決相信，再隔十年廿年之後，日本必能重整旗鼓，一卜雌雄。所以遠東和平的關鍵，還在四强管區日本收效如何。我們鑒於第二次歐洲大戰的爆發，更相信和平須建立在合理的基礎上，始能維持永久。處理日本，如果訴諸理智，或一味感情用事，予以最嚴厲最苛刻的待遇，或强國間步調不一致，甚至暗中扶植日本之再起，則第一次世界大戰後的德國，可為前車之鑒。所以如何處理戰敗的日本，不是一個單純的問題，而其影響所及，尤和我們中國有切身關係。</p>
<p>美國所提出的四强公約草案，在大體上可以滿意，中英兩國政府在原則上亦已表示贊同。所成問題的，僅在蘇聯方面，迄未答覆，贊成與否，尚不可知。本報社論，指出蘇聯有參加共同防止德日再起的二十五年同盟的必要，已非一次。觀於最近國際政局的發展，為歐洲的和平計，為遠東的安全計，蘇聯更應贊助美國相繼提出的兩種四强公約草案。如何處置德國的問題，今姑置勿論，但怎樣收拾戰敗的日本，確是當前遠東最嚴重的問題。我們翻閱近代歷史，每次國際戰爭結束之後，莫不立即召開和會，以收拾戰後的國際殘局，謀得暫時的和平與安定，但是這次大戰結果後的情形，却逈然不同。在歐洲方面，德國投降迄今，將近一年，但是召集廿一國和平會議，四强還不能完全同意，尚待外長會議的決定。在遠東方面，因歐洲僵局無法打開，遠東問題亦更不易解决，而一般情勢，凌亂不堪，尤待迅速澄淸。美國的建議實為非常明智之舉，對於未來遠東形勢，將有極大的貢獻。蘇聯外交家對此，當然也知之甚稔，蘇聯如表同意，當為美蘇兩國在遠東合作的起點，同時也是世界大局由「分」而趨向「合」的轉捩點。</p>
<p>戰後的遠東形勢，因為美蘇兩國對於日本，朝鮮，暨我國東北問題，意見相左，幾有積有相容的情形，後經莫斯科三國外長會議之後，對於雙方所爭執的問題，始獲暫時的妥協，而遠東形勢亦充備了光明祥和的景象。可是最近六個月來，這些問題又都沒有獲得澈底解决，尤其是對於日本問題，蘇聯常以美國「包辦」相責，而美國對於蘇聯，亦懷有戒心，所以為正本淸源起見，由四强簽訂公約，監督日本除解武裝，以防侵略勢力的捲土重來，確實是刻不容緩的了。</p>
<p>最後，我們盼望美國所提出的兩種四强公約昔案，能够同時成立，俾為歐洲和平與遠東安全樹立兩個堅固的台柱。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日廣播：四强外長會議，已進入最後階段，明日起，各外長每日開會兩次，期在下週末前結束談判。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕四國分外長會議現正努力，擬於本年七月十五日召集歐洲廿一國和平會議，此事係由美代表團建議，經英法兩國代表在原則上表示同意，卒因蘇聯外長莫洛托夫得出異議，未能成立協議。美國務卿貝爾納斯提出上項建議時，曾指陣整和平方案，宜在本年九月間聯合國機構舉行大會之前起草竣事，幷謂德奧兩國問題宜在邀請廿一國參加和平會議之請柬發出以後，始乃提付審議。但蘇聯外長莫洛托夫不以為然，謂各種和平條約尚有許多重要問題待決，茲若立即決定和會召集日期，實乃危險之事。英外相貝文乃提議展至一星期，再作召開和會之最後決議。關於議奧兩國邊界暨義艦隊處置問題，因專家委員會所當提出之報告書尚未脫稿，未能全面加以考慮。關於杜特坎尼斯羣島隸屬問題，蘇外長莫洛托夫要求展緩討論，渠當於本日午後與希臘駐法公使會商。四國外長會議下次會議，定於本月廿四日舉行，届時當討論義奧兩國邊界問題，法義兩國邊界問題，暨義大利艦隊分配問題。依照英外相貝文所建議，四國外長幷決定每日舉行會議兩次。</p>

<p>〔聯合社比基尼珊瑚礁原子彈試騐參觀船亞帕蘭欽號上二十二日電〕本船載運記者及廣播員一百五十人以上，自檀香山出發，前往試騐地點附近。船上本日舉行首次記者例會，宣布第一次原子炸彈之試騐，將為純粹實騐性質，而非海軍作戰試騐。海軍當局於去年秋間在三種可能的原子彈試騐進行選擇，其中無一次能包括全部試騐。計（一）純粹實騐式—測量炸彈本身，使其在高空爆炸；（二）海港襲擊式—在水面或水面下襲擊；（三）攻擊艦船式—從深水瀑炸。第一路試騐預定於七月一日舉行。海港襲擊試騐定於七月二十日舉行，以淺水湖底碇泊塲中爆炸。第一次試騐，爆炸之壓力，在船上前後左右及所有甲板上等，普通炸彈及魚雷，僅向一邊施壓力，而破碎其受壓之一邊。因純係實騐性質，各船將安為佈置，以測知何船可以保存，及船與人安全之限度及距離。</p>
<p>高熱度能熔化銅鐵</p>
<p>至於此項炸彈對於吉普車·卡車，飛機及其他軍事配備之影響，非至試騐後不能斷言，此種配備當在愼密選擇之距離內置於甲板上。炸彈內部之熱力與爆風，大約為華氏溫度計一萬萬度。科學家將研究銅板砲塔外殼所受之影響，此種砲塔有融化可能。全世界從無如此巨大與高溫之火爐，可供此種試騐。</p>

<p>上海市商會昨日上午在河南北路該會會址，舉行第九屆全體會員大會，亦為勝利以來第一次全體會員大會，中央組織部長陳立夫，社會部長谷正綱，經濟部長王雲五，特自京來滬，出席致訓，本市首長到有市長吳國楨，市黨部主任委員吳紹澍，社會局長吳開先，暨該會會員（各業公會）二百餘單位，共一千五百餘人，濟濟一堂，盛況空前，大會主席團為王曉籟·杜月笙·徐寄廣·金潤庠·葛傑臣，九時半開會，行禮如儀後，首由主席團王曉籟致開會詞，略稱：抗戰開始本會先在租界苦心維持，旋被迫遷移香港，後復追隨政府移設陪都，始終擁擭抗建國策，從事抗建工作，勝利後，得重返上海，至為欣慰，本會復員後，時已十月，各公會之整理工作，大致就緒，今後之設施，千頭萬緒，祁各位共同努力，以赴事功。</p>
<p>陳立夫次由中央組織部長陳立夫致詞稱：上海是工商業中心，具有領導全國工商業之作用，抗戰之目的在建國，我們要建設一個現代化的國家，這就是要「工業化」，在座各位，對建國的使命，頗為重大，在此大時代中，政府和人民，兩方面都要努力，在人民要有健全的社會組織，在政府要有完善的經濟政策，勝利後，放在眼前的，仍有許多問題，尚待解決。政府的政策，有需要修正之處，社會的力量，也還不夠，不能配合呼應，我們要有健全的政策，和偉大的社會力量，上海工商界是全國工商界的領袖，共同努力組織一健全的商會，諸位有什麼話，儘可痛快地說出來，有什麼完善的具體意見，儘可提出來，以為政府參考，要使一個工商業的城市繁榮，第一是「交通」蔣主席在停戰的十五天中，要共產黨恢復交通，交通之恢復，與建國有密切的關係，希望共產黨顧到國家的前途，人民的痛苦，早日恢提交通。第二是「金融」要調整金融，使工商業皆受其益目前的金融政策是否有助於工商業的發展，政府應考慮及此，在民主的潮流中，希望各位儘量說話，盡量提出意見，那一個違反民主，那一個便失敗。余極願協助各位，實現各位的意見，陳氏講畢全場報以熱烈之掌聲。</p>
<p>谷正鋼繼由社會部長谷正綱致訓，谷氏首對上海工商界在抗戰初期，以機器內移，協助生產，歷盡艱辛，表示欽佩，並對市商會之由上海遷香港，而重慶，協助抗戰，表示感謝。谷氏指出建國之二大目標：（一）政治民主化，（二）經濟工業化，此為中央既定之國策。並貢獻上海工商界二點：（一）健全工商團體組織，網羅各業領袖人物，改進工商業智識技術，提高工商界道德，（二）鞏固國際統一，本人此次奉中央命，赴蘇北救濟難胞，鎭江，揚州，泰縣一帶，看到成千成萬的難胞，遍山遍野的破壞了的農村，景象至為悽慘，共產黨提出所謂「三資」鬥爭，所謂「三資」即具有「資望」，擁有「資產」，富有「資格」者，皆被殺害或被迫流亡，故蘇北難民，不乏有身份之士紳，與知識階級·工商業的危機之一，是原料缺乏，農村破產了，原料那裏來，故政治問題不能解決，經濟問題是難於解決的。谷氏最後希望工商界注意政治問題擁護國策，度過經濟難關。</p>
<p>王雲五經由經濟部長王雲五致訓，玉氏提出「開源節流」四個字，來解決經濟問題，開源即努力生產，其責任在政府與人民雙方，政府與人民共同努力。講到節流，首要提倡節約，上海奢侈之風，較戰前猶盛，希望商會領導各同業公會，提倡節約運動。</p>
<p>吳市長繼由吳市長訓話，指出目前工商界二大危機：（一）守在危機，國內工商界不能與國外工商界競爭，（二）內在的危機，國內工商業因種種問題，不能發展，並希望工商界與政府合作，以渡過難關。旋由市黨部主委吳紹澍，社會局長吳開先，相繼致詞後，十一時許全體攝影留念，並通過向　蔣主席致敬電文，（附名）末由主席團徐寄廣，金潤庠，葛傑臣報告會務後散會。下午二時繼續開會，討論章程與提案，並選舉理監事，最後臨時動議，通過組織請願團，赴京向政府請願，請政府採納大會之建議，及建立紀念石碑，以表揚本會領導各公會支持抗戰之忠貞精神等十餘案，至七時始完滿閉會。</p>

<h3 id="c68">颱風今午襲滬 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕昨日本市狂風竟日，但實際上颱風須於今午始行到達本市附近，故今日風勢之狂，必在昨日之上。據徐家匯天文台龍相齊神父告記者稱：此次颱風係由台灣附近出發，昨日下午，颱風中心在北緯廿六度，東經一百廿一度半之處，正以每小時十五哩之速度，向北北西進發，今日午刻抵上海或從上海北部掠過，其時風力，約為每小時一百六十公里，中心地區為北緯廿六至三十度，東經一百廿六度至一百三十度。按此次颱風，係於廿一日在恒春附近海上向北轉進，廿二晨到達花連港東北海岸。</p>
<p>又據氣象台天氣預報：黃海，曇有霾，清勁東風，海浪中度至局部巨暴。華中，陰，局部雨成霧，中度北風至東風。上海，陰更濕熱，有陣雨及暴風，強勁東南風。東海，北部陰，清勁東風，海浪巨暴。南部與北台灣，石垣島，陰有陣雨，旋風暴，海浪汹涌。廿三日溫度：最高八八·四度。最低七六·八度。</p>
<p>昨日外灘天文台已懸掛八號颱風危險信號黑球，夜間開放四號紅燈，以警告進出航商。又查最大之颱風，其級數至多十二級，而此次颱風之中心風力，竟達十一級，面積約五十英哩，實為本年第一次最大之颱風。照風勢發展情形觀測，台彎之北部已遭受嚴重之襲擊，其次為溫州云。</p>
<p>風力每小時百六十公里</p>

<p>〔中央社南菁廿三日電〕據中央氣象局廿三日夜十時半報告，重要颱風正進至我國東南方，廿三日晨七時重心在福州，現在向北方推進中。每小時之速率十五公里，如速率及方向不變，則廿四日晨可達浙江境內，並將到達上海及揚子江一帶，屆時速率或將增強。</p>
<h3 id="c70">囹圄生活 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>曾經有一個普通刑事犯帶着責問的口氣問獄卒：「爲什麽那些漢奸住在監牢裏仍舊逍遙自在，一無憂色，而我關在這裏，卻一天到晚可惱萬分？」獄卒的回答祗是一個神秘的微笑。要找到這個問題的答案，祗要看那些每天聚候在上海監獄門首送物的漢奸家屬，他（她）們的年裏，從裝滿了魚肉佳饌的食盒，到書報，象棋之類的消遣品，甚至光亮的銅床，嶄新的帆布椅子，都有遞進去，供他們舒適地享受。在敵人的鐵蹄之下，他們曾然要面無憂色了。可是普通囚犯的日常生恬怎樣呢？記者為此，特走訪上海地方法院看守所所長田立勛氏，承他殷殷地引導記者參觀該所，始得悉</p>
<p>勞作視同娛樂場</p>
<p>一個人如果犯了罪被押在地院看守所裏，他第一個感覺到的便是住「所」的狹窄，我們平常呼「囹圄」為「囚籠」，這個「籠」字，普通是視為一個譬如，而實際上他們的「號房」，確實祇是個二十方尺大小的籠子。說一句非常可憐的話，它們實在比復興公園動物園裏囚獅、虎的地方也相差得太遠了。就是這麼一個小籠子裏，要囚上五個犯人（照規矩是四個），他們坐下來也不覺寬大，待到晚上睡覺的時候，你想該是一副怎樣的擠軋相呢？因此每一個犯人，能夠跑出來在院子裏走幾個圈子，在他們便覺得如入天堂了。可是因為看守所的地方實在太小，現在在押的犯人數達二千一百八十七名，所以他們輪流出來遊「天堂」的機會，每天也祗有早晚各半小時。他們另外還有一種娛樂的方法，那就是勞作。「高貴」的紳士、太太們聽了我的話也許要喫驚。但看守所裏的囚犯確實是把勞作視同娛樂的，他們都希望跑出狹窄的囚籠到寬舒的作場裏去伸展一下他們麻痹的軀體，振作起頹敗的精神，暫時把嚙心的牢獄生活的思想丟在腦後，嚐一嚐生活的眞珠。可是這樣的機會也祇有四分之一，因為作場小，囚犯的流動性大，昨議僅有縫紉·印刷·裝盒·裝袋·木工·自鐵·洗衣·理髮等輕便的手工業，現役人數祇有五百餘人。由於規模小，所以盈餘也不大，四月份僅得十餘萬，五月份亦不過一百餘萬，據田所長佔計，六月份可能盈餘達四百萬元。所以在役的囚工也有一筆小小的零用錢可拿。</p>
<p>囚犯亦是外國好</p>
<p>至於他們的吃，規定早晚兩餐，本籍犯每人每餐發乾飯廿一鎊，蔬菜四兩，外籍犯則發麵包十四兩，牛肉菜湯一碗。所以那些沒有家屬每天去送小菜的囚犯，一定要白嘆：「囚犯也是外國的好」了。這也許是租界時代的遺風吧？病犯的膳食是每天發給三次得白米稀飯，外加醬菜，普通的疾病都可在所內德醫務室中治愈，較重的病犯還有看護調護，監房的內外也很清潔，最近剛噴射過二次DDT，白蟲跳蚤撲滅了不少，所以傳染病的威脅已經大大地減輕了。</p>
<p>田所長對於囚犯的教誨非常注意，每日分集體及個別的教誨二種，前者長達一小時，後者則隨時行之，並不固定。但爲了要使他們能「閉門思過」，避免外界對他們的刺激性，都側重於灌輸式的方法，不准自由閱讀書報，難怪最近押進去的糧官任星崖要大嘆：「他們連報紙也不給我看呢！」</p>
<p>由比看來，那個自嘆「苦腦萬分」的囚犯，確非故意做作，無病呻吟，而且也難免要「悔不當初狠心做漢奸」了。（行天）</p>

<p>如果把上海看成一個舞台，「房荒」是正在上演中的一幕短劇，那來這裏所要提到的「臨時棚屋」可以說是短劇中的一支小的插曲。</p>
<p>最近在閘北南市楊樹浦和徐家滙一帶的空地上，出現了許許多多　次櫛比的小木房和小草棚。住在這些棚屋裏的棚戶，大都自稱是蘇北流亡來滬的難民，他們事先沒有徵得土地業主的同意，也沒有獲得工務局營造處的許可，用「閃電」的方式，在一夜或者一天之內，七拚八湊地搭起一間間的棚屋來。先是少數人開始，接帶就像一陳風似池羣起效尤。現在差不多市區內所有的空池上都可以發現這種大小不一的棚屋，其中特別引人注意的是在福開森路霞飛路口一路電章到底的地方。因為這一個地段本來是所謂「超級」的住宅區，棚屋四週都是些美奐美輪的洋房，尤其左鄰就是一座六層高樓的大輪船形的巨廈，相形之下，形成一種很強烈的對照，令人感到非常地不調和。</p>
<p>本來呢，地皮空着，現在既有這批自稱「蘇北難民」的來自動搭屋暫作棲蔭之所，似乎也未可厚非。不過情形可並不這樣簡單因為這牽涉到許多其他的問題：第一是業主的財產所有權，這一個法律上人類最「原始」的權利顯然已受到了侵害。其次，這些棚屋的建造無不因陋就簡，所用材料不外乎易燃的蘆席木阪簾片等雷，密密層層地靠在一起，住居的人又比較瀾雜，很令人引起對於火災與衛生方面的憂慮。而最令人不滿的還在於其中另有黑幕。據說有不少具「特殊下層勞力」的人物，也假借難民的名義，用大約五十萬至八十萬的本　來「投資」於這種棚屋的建造。造成以後，以一百二十萬以上的頂費讓給別人，一轉手間就可獲致厚利。上海真是一個複雜的都市，一切五花八門的事情正在演着。</p>
<p>原先工務局在去年十一月間已訂定一種「臨時棚屋建築暫行辦法。」現在已搭成的棚屋大多數都不合乎這個規定，工務局方面老早就考慮着把那些未經許可的加以拆除，並且警察局方面也已經接到不少土地業主的訴苦呈文，所以，現在雙方正在商議着在預備短期內執行。</p>
<p>記者日前特地到福開森路去作一番實地的觀察。這一區的棚屋一共有二十多間，高低參差，大小不一。屋頂有用的紅瓦的，有用灰瓦的，有用蘆席的，有用草舖的。門牆分兩種，一種是用木板的，一種是用竹片泥巴的，裏面大多是泥地，陰暗潮濕，破爛的傢俱，一望而知是些窮苦的人家。近馬路處有一家水果店已經開張，另外有幾間比較整齊的瓦頂木房卻用鎖鎖着，不知是不是在待價而估？</p>
<p>在攝影的時候，從哪些　　　裏　　了不少的人，牢牢地跟在後面。他們正担心着房子的被拆除，對記者露着請求的目光說：</p>
<p>「先生，請你們說說好話吧！我們是蘇北米的難民，沒有辦法！」</p>
<p>杜甫詩說：「安得廣廈千萬間，大庇天下寒士盡歡顏」，詩人的熱烈情感，雖在千百年後的今日，仍能引起有心人的無限共鳴與嗟歎。然而記者除了客觀地把事實寫出之外，還有什麼話可以說呢？（飛鴻）</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕去年全國教育復員會議開會時，為救濟收復區專科以上學校學生學業，經已定甄審原則，經教部核定分區設立臨時大學補習班，收錄該項學生，先予補習，嗣因各地交通困難，遷至內地各校，未能於短期內復員，該項學生無法即行轉入正式大學肄業。教部為顧念學生學業，並應事實需要，特令各補習班依照大學科目表之規定，加授基本課程，並訂定收復區專科以上學校肄業生學業處理辦法，及各臨時大學補習班修業未滿學生結業甄試分發辦法，對最高年級學生補習期滿甄試成績及格者，由教部發給臨時大學畢業證明書。惟有一部份將屆畢業學生，仍欲入正式專科以上學校肄業，以便取得正式學校畢業證書。該項學生在班己修業期滿，如重行入學，在谷校既受容量之限制，不能普遍收錄，而該項學生重複學習，實增加其經濟之負担，耗贊光陰。為救此項事實上之困難，教部業經多次考慮研究，俾減少學校及學生之困難。聞該部最近遵奉主席指示原則，擬定各臨時大學補習班畢業學生畢業證書發給辦法，通飭施行。茲將該項辦法探誌於後：（一）各臨時大學補習畢業生畢業資格，經教部核准者，由部發給臨時大學畢業證明書。（二）各臨時大學補習班畢業生，校發給畢業證書；（三）志願參加國立專科以上學校畢業考試之各臨時大學補習班畢業生，得自行認定一校，並於該校三十六年舉行畢業考試前三個月，繕具學歷表，連同臨時大學畢業證明書，及本人二寸半身照片二張，逕向校申請報名，由校審核後，通知其應參加考試之科目；（四）前條考試科目，與各該校各該科系之畢業考試科目相同；（五）考試及格學生，由校造冊填製畢業證書，呈部騐印，並將臨時大學畢業證明書呈部註銷；（六）此項考試辦法，以呈部註銷；（六）此項考試辦法，以三十六年暑期一次為限。</p>

<p>港星東足球隊上週受挫於青白後，昨日又遭第二度之敗北，以二比三敗於華聯隊，上半時星東以二比一佔先，下半時竟一無所得，華聯隊則於十分鐘內連中二球反敗為勝。比賽過程，相當緊張，但表演似少精彩，入後漸佳，華聯守門張邦綸昨日救出險球無數，若干必中之球，竟為接得，實為華聯昨日獲勝之大功臣。球場秩序昨日並不因門票提高而改善，萬餘球迷仍四面衝破籬笆越牆而入，雖經不憲極力維持，但缺口如潮湧入，亦無法阻止，混亂不堪，深為遺憾，昨日購票入內者聞僅千六百餘人。</p>
<p>各有千秋</p>
<p>華聯陣容，昨直至比賽前數分鐘才決定，初頗有難產之勢，青白因星期三須再戰星東，為保持實力，李義臣高保正俱在休息之列，吳祺祥初亦擬列入候補，卒因後衛重要，終於登場，鐔福禎因病、仍由孟義良坐鎮中堅，韓龍海改任其老本行右前衛，惟因任前鋒已久，其位置有常介乎鋒衛之間。華聯以十一人始終，佈置尚稱得宜，各稱其職。星東以郭英祺張金海互換位置，許竟成改任左衛，費春華賈幼良卒因之活動困難，論實力各有千秋，勝負之分，華聯後防充實，星東屢攻不入，上半時雖操縱大局，僅勝一球，下半時無法反攻，亦因華聯之銅牆鐵壁也。</p>

<p>裁判何春暉鳴笛開賽，華聯順風，星東逆犯，馮景祥進襲，遭孟義良攔截，兆榮再傳碩友，碩友遙射，試投虛實，球勢峻急，吳祺祥搶救，阻成角球，未見得失。九分鐘時，兆榮東山再起，士鑫戒備森嚴，星東又未得手，未幾，鐵腿窺得左角空虛，急遞李垚，越過敵衛叩門，朱兆恒救出阿斗，化險為夷。嗣後雙方即陷於混戰，球勢雖操縱於星東，但均不得其門而入。</p>
<p>星東佔先</p>
<p>直至廿三分鐘時，郭英祺中路興師，小傳前鋒，兆榮看得正切，左腳起處，球從右角入網，邦綸撲救不及，遂吿淪陷，一比〇星東首破紀錄。客軍聲勢大增，鄧廣森底綫勾中，兆榮頭頂攻門，張邦綸左右照顧，備見忙碌，華聯反攻，李垚，得孟義良接濟，左路疾進，榕生迎阻，球入鐵腿腳廈，盤至星東門前，輕輕一發，球已人網，一對一扳成和局，之後雙方短兵相接，衝突猛烈，至上半場了前一分鐘，費春華失一必中之球，觀眾正為嘆惜，星東前鋒，已臨門前，兆榮單騎深入，至廿五碼處猛射，又告守的，星東以二對一結束上半場。</p>
<p>連中二球</p>
<p>檸檬過後，兩軍各商機密，星東候榕生舊創復發下場，羅偉權人補，華聯方面，雖列將十七，作壁上觀者六人故陳綫未變更，開球後，華聯前鋒五虎，連騎並進，左腳王看前顧後，馮紳勝協力招架，煞費氣力。七分鐘時，李堯開角球，許竟成釘住孫錦順，羅偉權麥克許交　，冷不防韓龍海竄來，劉松生以為敵將叩開，急急趕來，星東門前，頓陷混亂，幼良窺得真切，輕發破網，二比二再造和局。華聯此時氣燄高張，在客軍禁區倐出倐人。僅僅二分鐘後。龍海遙傳幼良，再遞右角，小費及時趕到，拉起一腳，應聲入網，三對二華聯後來居上。星東羣策羣力，總圍反攻，龍海永福位置互易，未能阻遏，黎兆榮如脫韁之馬，數度來犯，均為邦綸救出。卅二分鐘時，李垚離場，馮景祥再犯，球從橫木越過，迨李垚二度下場，時間亦已將終了，混戰未及數合，銀笛起處，雙方收軍，三比二華聯力搓星東。</p>

<p>昨天星東對華聯之役，表演精彩，但是觀衆的表演更是精彩絕倫，觀眾衝進球場，有如衝鋒陷陣，萬馬奔騰，越牆而入者不計其數，一萬元門票買不起，球是非看不可，結果當然是「人急跳墻」了，昨票子僅售出一千六百張，但是觀眾卻有兩萬，就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>昨日星東之敗，主要原因在守門技術的幼稚，華聯之勝應歸功門將賬邦綸，小張是昨天球賽的驕子，比賽終了，他穿了球衣，帶了一位美人（不是美國人）坐了三輪車，招搖過市，後面跟了一羣小三子小六子，竟有高呼張邦綸萬歲者，足見足球英維的受人歡迎。</p>
<p>兩位小球迷，「從天而降」，結果掛彩，救護者替他們包好之後，送他們到最好的位置看球，記者問他們傷勢怎樣，其中一位答稱：「祇要有球看，這一點小傷，勿要擺勒心浪」。</p>

<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>我和龐薰琴　差不多上十個年頭沒有看見。這次，聽見他已經由重慶飛歸滬上，使我覺得無限欣喜，終于我們是晤面了。</p>
<p>很多人要恭維我們常熟人，說常熟地方好，文化發達，每一們朝代有大藝術家產生，比如元季的黃一峰，清初的王耕煙，吳墨井和蔣南沙，現代中國畫家之中，龐薰琴也先非常有地位的。</p>
<p>其實，在政治安定，生活沒有問題的時候，我們常熟，有錦繡的盧山，艷漣的尚潮，加上了文化傳統的優越，產生幾個優秀的藝術家是非常可能的。可是抗戰以來，敵寇縱橫，兵荒馬亂，農村裏鬧的是饑饉，掠奪，勝利以後，依然到處是動蕩現象，怎談得到什麼藝術呢？</p>
<p>薰琴一看見我，首先就談起故鄉的這一種情形，使他深深地感到失望。</p>
<p>他很早就到巴黎去研究美術，研究二十世紀新興繪畫，不論在構思上，施色上，用筆上……都表現一點新鮮的氣氛。他回國已過十五年了，前一些時間，曾經下過一點功夫，做推行新藝術運動，近十年來，為了抗戰，他奔走跋涉，僅可能地使他在毛筆畫與歷代裝飾美術的研究上得到一點收穫。本來，他應該要到敦煌，古代佛教美術的寶藏去做研究工作，可是還沒有實現。不要說研究，最近運在上海想找一個比較安頓的住宅還沒有辦法。</p>
<p>決瀾社，在中國洋畫運動中是有歷史地位的，它成立于民國二十一年秋天，是薰琴所發動的，參加了倪貽德，周多，段平右，楊太陽，楊秋人，張弦……都是當時優秀的畫家，他們是要求新技法的獲得，鄙視傖俗，殘簿的學院派的藝術，在中國新興藝術運動的歷程上看，這是一個其有非常價值的團體，雖然，在當時，他們只憧憬于所謂二十世紀繪畫的形式，如狂暴的野獸主義，變形的立體主義，虛無的達迷主義，怪誕的超現實主義……這些，是否就能夠表現中國的新藝術，尚成問題，可是，在創造中國新藝術的歷程之中，實在是不可缺少的。</p>
<p>決瀾社成立時，曾經有過這樣的宣言：</p>
<p>「環繞我們的空氣太沉寂了，平凡與庸俗包圍了我們的四周。無數低能者的蠢動，無數淺薄者的叫囂。</p>
<p>「我們厭惡一切舊的形式，舊的色彩，厭惡一切平凡的低級的技巧。我們要用新的技法來表現新的時代精神。</p>
<p>「讓我們起來吧！用了狂飆一般的激情，鐵一般的理智，來創造我們色，線，形交錯的世界吧！」</p>
<p>這裏面的許多話，我們只感到一種革命的熱情，這種熱情，是創造申國新藝術的酵母，那是不可否定的。</p>
<p>薰琴的畫，近來是怎樣了？我很關心着這個問題。</p>
<p>最近，他有一幅「白描人物」的小幀給倫敦的某收藏家以一百廿五鎊購去，這是他個人的成功，但也是中國美術界國際地位增高的明證。</p>
<p>他的畫究竟是怎樣的？在前些時間的上海美術作家協會展中已經看見二幅人物畫，他表示這是不經意之作。但，我們覺得，薰琴近十年來，是在中國固有毛筆畫中的線條上做功夫，使線條本身簡潔，雋秀，美妙，再以這種線條完成中國畫中素向忽略的寫實，又可以說：從古樸，典雅中表現真實，輕視文人墨戲中的寫意。可以說：這對中國畫發展的前途上是有利的建造。</p>
<p>可惜，還沒有機會看到他的全部精心傑構。而且，薰琴是一個議慎的作家，他認為，這幾年來比較滿意的結果實在太少了。</p>
<h3 id="c105">僅有的溫情 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 君平</p>
<p>不去蘇州十年了，近來雖很想抽暇去玩玩，但咫尺天涯，結果還是沒有成行，這在我多少不免有悵惘之感。因為蘇州對於我實在不很陌生，除了虎邱、木瀆，靈岩等勝景以外，還有一段令人神往的事，使我夢寐難安，這一段往事不是戀情，不是緋色的夢幻，而是人世間僅有的一點溫情，使一個漂泊天涯的遊子第一次體驗到人情的可貴。</p>
<p>十年前的夏大，我受聘担任蘇州公園路草橋中學的教員，一方面還替上海幾家報紙經常撰稿，雖然全部收入不過八九十元，但那時物價很低，八九十元至少可買白米十担以上，而且蘇州除了日用品以外，幾乎什麼東西都比上海便宜，我那時祗要把全部收入寄三分之一到浙江的家里去，其餘三分之二都可以由自己隨便去化的，五六十元維持一個人生活，雖不見得如何富麗，但也並不感到十分狼狽。日子一久就跟同事們混得很熱悉了，大家都問我為什麼不把太太從浙江接出來？我說自己也很想把她接出來，過慣家庭生活的人，對於再過流浪者的生活確實不很習慣，而且學校里的宿舍太狹小，要培養良好的寫作情緒，自非另我房子不可。</p>
<p>全事史君曾領我去看幾處房子，結果都不很滿意，最後揀到了齊門路下塘一個姓謝的房子，房子是沿河的，上下共有十幾間，而且還有客廳，還有天井，當時言明樓上左右廂房和客堂樓租給我，客廳大家公用，房租侮月祗有十五元，我出了這些低廉的代價，可以居住三大間房子，心中自然感到非常欣慰，我一個人本來用不到住這末許多房子，但我既然準備把家眷接到蘇州來，這些房子雖然還嫌太多，但也不妨讓自己和妻住得舒服一些。</p>
<p>房東謝先生是一個六十左右的老人，說地老其實還不很適當，因為看上去他不過是一個五十左右的人，他有一妻一妾，和一個二十歲左右的女兒，除此以外，他還僱着一個老媽媽和領着一個叫娟香的丫頭，這幾個人我和他們在生活上發生接觸以後，我立刻發現他們都是非常善良的人，祗有房東的小老婆例外，因為她是一個十分低能而且還带着神經質的女人，在上海話說來她就是有些「十三點」氣氛的女人，她每天風雨無阻的到書場里去聽書，聽了回來就指天劃地的大談，「白娘娘」或「薛仁貴」，我一開始就發現他們的家庭非常正常，僅僅那個神經質的女人混在里面有些顯得反常罷了。</p>
<p>後來我同他們混得更斯熟了，我居然可以毫不顧忌的參加他們在天井中的談話，他們雖然每天叫佣人送茶送水，洗衣服，替我不遺餘力的服務，但謝太太還很關懷我，時常問我浙江的妻子什麽時候可以接出來？謝小姐因為我會寫些文章，也常常要我把貼報　上的文章給她看，因為她是有些文藝氣息的少女，對於文人是比較同情和尊重的，我從小沒有得到家庭的溫暖，現在居然在別人的家庭里享受人間難得的溫情，當時的心情實在是無法可以形容的。</p>
<p>後來我終於把妻子從浙江接出來，那時妻已經有着七個月的身孕，我本來打算趁生產以後。再接她出來，但鄉下沒有比較好的產科醫院，結果陪她到蘇州來，妻到了蘇州，謝家的人都非常高興，他們特地為她買了許多菜蔬，由謝太太親自烹調，那一夜我酒喝得太多，搖搖擺擺走上樓梯的時，還聽見他們正圍着妻在高談闊論。</p>
<p>不久妻要生產了，醫院在天賜莊博習醫院，那時我正在學校里上課，妻就由謝太太和她的小姐兩個人陪伴着到醫院里去，那一年天氣特別熱，寒暑表幾乎每天都在一百度左右，她們二個人在烈日之下陪了妻坐人力車到醫院里去，孩子　下不久就死了，妻因為是第一次生產，她很為死去的孩子傷心，後來妻告訴我，她們表面上雖勸妻不要過份傷心，但她們躲在房間外面，卻為死去的孩子暗暗地啜泣！</p>
<p>後米我带着妻終於離開蘇州了，我只間接的知道謝先生過了不久因為中風而去世了，謝家的小姐也嫁人了，世事滄桑，一切都遺精變遷了吧？我雖飄泊在外面，但我卻無時無地不在牽念着他們，因為他們是我平生難得看見的善良的人，我也難得領略到人世間僅有的一點溫情。</p>

<p>在一個風和日麗，靜靜的午日，我孤零零地踏出門口，我遇見了他，我引着他一起去公園，在柔軟的草坪上徜徉，他緊緊的依偎着我，顯得很親熱，而我　着有所思的凝視着蔚藍的渺遠的天空，我忘了他，在我走出園門跨上街道時，一眼，撇見他依舊默默的跟着我，我跨進咖啡館，抽着煙捲，一支接連着一支，清煙在眼前　繞，霧一樣夢一樣，濃郁的刺激，刺痛了我的神經，我失　地挪下錢，離開去，玻璃門在我身後輕輕闔上，我又遇見了他，「跟我走吧，」苦笑一下，他又把身子依偎着我，他跟隨着我，緊緊的跟着我。</p>

<p>關於教育，我是一竅不通，不過近來略為有一點感想。</p>
<p>一個朋友的兒子，本學期考入某某初中。開學時，好容易付清了學費，雜費，衛生費，勞作費，講義費，等等各色各樣的費，不料開學不久，校中發來通知一張，說是奉教廳之命，學生每天必須穿童子軍制服到校，否則不許1駟撫！獅，無可奈何之下，只能忍痛命兒子停學。</p>
<p>為了一套制服使青年子弟中途廢學！在報上早已見到過。我們極贊成每個學生穿規定的制服，因為非但整齊美觀，並能避免奢侈浮華。我們更極擁護政府所規定的童子軍教育，童子軍教育是要使少年們鍛鍊身體，養成一種對人對國的勞動服務精神。不過，在這百物昂貴，饑聲遍地的時候、任何事情，我們不能不面面顧到，而權衡其輕重得失。我們要搶救教育，我們要搶救文盲，那麼，那一類的「命令」。似乎不妨留一點通融的餘地。</p>
<p>教育的最大目的是要使人知書明理，說到鍛煉健身，說到勞動服務，到底也不單單在一些服裝和形式上吧！　（中原）</p>

<p>漸漸春寒過去了，氣候轉暖，加上廖老闆不遺餘力地給矛醫藥的治療，小紅的腳一天比一天好起來，但是正如大夫所說，好的非常慢，折磨得小紅已經骨瘦如柴。在小紅臥病這個期間，一切寶鈴代她做的事全代她做了。並且不斷悄悄去看望小紅。按寶鈴的意思，不如請外科洋大夫來治寮，但廖老闆絕不肯，他依然固執地反對洋大夫，反對洋藥。甚而是勢不兩立地一種「反對」！</p>
<p>就這樣小紅日以繼夜地輾轉病榻，她感激廖老闆，但她也怨廖老闆！她雖然才不過活了十五個年頭，她已經早就活得厭煩了！特別是每次聽見老闆娘在一邊「指桑罵槐」，她便覺得活下去實在是多餘的！她怕再過那未來的日子，她想，只有死才是解除痛苦的唯一出路，然而他竟死不了！黑夜似乎對於她更長了，她深深感到：她將永遠看不見天明，她將永遠陷在黑夜裏。除去廖老闆，她也感激寶鈴，而且她可憐寶鈴！為寶鈴抱屈！因為他知道寶鈴和她一樣地苦，一樣地受着磨折！世界上，只有不幸的人才同情不幸的人；所以寶鈴同情她；她同情寶鈴！不過，廖棟爲什麽就不同情她呢？廖棟不是一樣的不幸嗎？她不能明白！因此，她感激廖老闆，感激寶鈴；加上恨老闆娘之外；便是對廖棟的感情逐漸地淡漠，乃至於努力忘掉他！她也想念爹媽；怨爹媽；自從她過門以來！爹媽好像就算是丟開了她；咫尺天涯，她竟不能回家去看看他們；他們也不來看看她。她常常喃哺自語：「真是：「嫁出去的姑娘，如潑出去的水」。爹媽就這樣狠心不要我了！」一點不錯，她確是被裁縫司務像剪衣服似的，一剪刀早把父女之情剪斷了！其實這又何嘗是裁縫司務所甘願的？誰叫生了女兒，又養不了女兄呢？所以，小紅一面怨爹媽；一面還是原諒爹媽；想念爹媽！</p>
<p>在一種交錯着種種複雜矛盾的心理情緒中，小紅只有迷茫地挨歲月，一天到晚只有閉緊了眼睛，聽憑命運的裁判！有什麼辦法呢？她的週圍這般黑暗。她找不到一盞燈，因此她看不見一塊可以超度自已的彼岸！</p>

<p>本市米價，自當局加意調劑後，雖實際尚未完全平服，但大勢已見穩定，苟能不斷努力，標本兼治，或不難渡過靑黃不接時間，惟一波甫平，一波又起，米市塲剛吿安靖，證券市塲突起波瀾，因公價還本付息之正式決定，於是公債黑市向日爲投機份十狂抬渴喊之高價，乃直綫下瀉，最低曾跌進三百元，證券字號先後倒閉多家，華洋股市亦受累不淺，至週六已議決暫停交易，此外商品，大多平平，惟糖與人造絲上漲稍巨耳，茲將一週經過，摘要如后。</p>
<p>烚赤　週初開盤爲一八七萬五千元，一度退至一八七萬元爲本週之最低價，週二平穩，其後以銀根鬆弛，買氣漸盛，至週五數度迫二百萬元關，後雖略降，但終站一九九萬五千元，爲本週之最高價，週六收盤一九三萬元，較上週末漲二萬五千元。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔週初開盤二五五〇元，一度退至二五二〇元，爲本週之最低價，週二週三徘徊於二六〇〇元左右，週五以求過於供，上展至二七〇〇元，午後更拉高至二七二〇元，爲本週之最高價，週未收盤二六六〇元，港票以週一二之四六〇元，爲最低價，週五匯業中人扒補，升至五一五元，以週六之五三〇元爲最高價。</p>
<p>公債　週初統丙開盤三〇五〇元，因傳財部將於七月份開始還本付息，退至二四五〇元，週二賣風仍烈，證券號擱淺頗多，週三補空頻繁，又上揚至三一五〇元，週五以按票面償還之說業經當局明確宣示，人心沮喪曾慘落至九五〇元，週六最低已到三百元，雖有一部份補空交易，做至七八百元，但已潰不成軍，於是由同業議決暫停交易。</p>
<p>華股　週初受統債慘落之影響，人心虛怯，空方乘機活躍，各股俱呈低價，三小熱略露秀色，但好景不常，週五又軋小一成光景，週六再受債市舉跌影響，喊價紊亂，無正式交易。</p>
<p>外股　週初亦以值股俱挫，買風四起，一致軋小，週三略見回升，週五以後又因俊股俱落，人心不支，一致劇降。</p>
<p>米糧　上週米市在當局控制下，始終穩定不變但內幕仍含儘意，非有澈底辦法，恐不易期其圓滑，麵粉週初平疲，週四以後，突然回升，於是交易亦宣吿停止，雜糧初亦無甚上落，而疲面居多，週五而後始見挺秀。</p>
<p>食糖　週初以客幫及本街實　　弱，市價上揚，嗣因台糖公司有隨時拋售之說，人心見虛，但並未能實現，人心轉堅，又復銳升，週四臺糖公司反抬高售似，市勢再度趨昻，週五，週六迭創高峯，此亦最近一引八注目之事也。</p>
<p>現鈔　在上週間，粗紗俏而細紗平，廣東帮認牌紗廿支特雙馬特金鷄特大發紅人鐘採辦甚殷，天津帮採購廿支水月豐年立馬日光等紗亦不弱，市勢極形俏俐，全週以星期六之四十二支藍鳳二百〇六萬爲最高，星期一之十支織女九十萬爲最低，若以支數言，則以廿支特雙馬特金鷄特大發紅人　各比前週漲八萬至十四萬爲最鉅，卅二支藍鳳九萬次之，十六支光明漲五萬，十支　女濃五萬，四十二支成使漲一萬，紡建公司　一開紗廿六種，星三廿八種，星五廿七種，共計八十一種。</p>
<p>布市　週內情勢極平庸，蓋以市上存底充沛，客帮與門莊需路無甚特色，僅桃花女士林及大明府綢稍有去化外，各比前週漲二千，其餘各牌大都相仿，惟十六磅粗布如花蝶等反跌一二千。</p>
<p>花布　紡建公司前後已有三週未曾採辦，其餘如民營紗廠，因買花紡紗，獲利仍厚，大生大成民豐慶　蘇倫新裕等廠均有採辦，價比前週漲二三千，　外紐約美棉期現貨均漲廿餘磅音。</p>
<p>人造絲　上週一二市　　平，無甚變化，迨週三又呈俏俐，週四銀錢業休假無市、　五因中　開價提高，復因二〇號有光無貨開出，兼之多頭搜購，於是造成瘋狂上漲之局面，週六不乏乘高拋售，乃稍下挫。</p>
<p>廠經　市况堅穩，洋行納胃稀薄，用戶實銷徽有，同行交易尚熱鬧，週初七十八分高勻度做價二百三十三萬元，廠商用七十六七分新單做價二百二十萬至二十五萬元，一週內中級五擔二百十萬元至十五萬元，另擔二百萬至〇五萬元，普通另擔一百九十萬至二百萬元，干經五擔貨一百五十五萬至六十五萬，各檔俱漲起五萬至十萬元之　。</p>
<p>綢貨　美亞被面一週內做開甚稀，喊價總在一百五十萬至五十二三萬元之間，大誠格十　綢交易雖多，售價步步下降，週一·五千五百七十元，週二小二稱抬開，高一百元，週六又疲落，終做五千二百二十元，杭貨各紡羅等俱見高漲，盛貨電力紡客帮搜購，價遂挺進。</p>

<p>貴報六月廿一日商業新聞欄，「紗花苦樂不均，製品更難爲繼」，一篇大作，詳述紗廠利潤太高，洋花占奪市塲，本國花衣反乏人問津各節，頗切時宜，惟關於「花衣業中人云」一節，似乎估計失實。</p>
<p>貴報載「吾國棉田每熟可收籽花三擔，每擔現價三萬元，共得九萬元左右」云云。</p>
<p>以事實論，吾國棉田每畝產量，平均只收穫籽花一擔，能收到一百五十斤者，已屬大豐年，而歉年只有三四十斤，所以吾國籽花與米之市價，常爲三與二之比，即戰前米一石價十元，籽化一擔價十五元，此乃依據花與米之產生量而然，所調天然成本也，目下籽花一擔價三萬元，米一石價五萬元，是則花價實際比較上，跌值百分之六十，常此以往，棉農其何能堪，當前農村破產危機，堪稱嚴重，棉農尤甚，望有識者，須加以援救，是所企望，至於棉田每畝之成本，（依目下之市僅）詳開如下。</p>
<p>田租：米四斗價以五萬元計，爲二萬二千五百元。豆餅平均一張半價以一萬元計，爲一萬五千元。花種十四斤，價以一百元計，爲一千四百元。春耕（種花工）四工，價每工以五千元計，爲二萬元，中耕（脫花）十工，每工以三千元計，爲三萬元。秋收（捉花）計六千元。又（拔花棋）計五千元。共計每畝需款九萬九千九百元正。收獲籽花平均一擔計洋三萬元（目下市價）花棋柴平均二擔計洋七千元，共計每畝收獲三萬七千元。每畝棉田虧本六萬二千九百元。</p>
<p>上項估見，均依必需枯盤計算，至於農作工資，受紗廠工資超越提高之影饗，亦相當提高，已超出戰前約一倍，（戰前每工約合米四升至五升，自下每工合米一斗）范氏家庭農藝社范施桂珍</p>

<h3 id="c122">目前的中國機械工業 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧蹊</p>
<p>有人說：中國所以的不強盛，工業不發達是一重要的因素。但工業的不發達，實在還是機被工業的衰落，沒人注意提倡，投資。事到今日，中國的機械工業總是浸在嗷嗷待哺的情况下。不是嗎，美國福特汽車廠在五分鐘能够製成一輛最流綫型的汽車（這倒是事實），但環顧中國人材旣大形缺乏，而事實上能製造，不關新式的舊式的汽車又有多少呢？當然更不用說其他的，更巨大複雜的機械工具了。所以，每一年我國自美國的機械輸入量，着　龐大得驚人。</p>
<p>機械工業的範圍是相當廣泛的，小如翻砂作木工塲（製模用），大如兵工廠造船所都可統括入之。而其工作大小亦視其工廠範圍而定，小者如日用之洋釘螺旋，大件者如自由車汽車重閘，紗廠中之紡紗機梳棉機，以及戰爭用者大砲機槍等等。而像最近經濟部統計，目前中國大小機械工廠（已包括中等以上之翻砂作木工塲）不出千餘家，而其中能製造洋釘螺旋釘者，尚不足半數。以至其他各種機械不得不仰自美國等處購得。而中國各式大小機械總共約有念萬架，遠不足日本三分之一。</p>
<p>推討中國機械工業，所以至目前情勢者，其最大的癥結，是政府沒有獎勵，而資本家亦因之無人提倡而不投資，此其一。人材的缺乏，機械工人的待遇又低，此其二。舊的以前的機械工程人員又不思改進研究，成本又總較外國高出不少。所以一般主顧大多向外國承購了。更一般的機械工廠又無營業方針，大多各自爲政缺少聯絡，此其三。</p>
<p>所以在勝利後的現在，中國建設的途徑上振興工業的口號下，如何謀中國機械工業的發展，倒也是件刻不容緩的事。今以管見所及茲有三點，不嫌淺陋提出，深望國內專家不吝賜敎爲幸。</p>
<p>（一）依目前的形勢說，政府亟應提倡獎勵資本家們投資。這是一方面說的。而另一方面對於現在中國的，不論範圍大小性質的機械工廠，應首先有劃一的必要。卽如這次經濟部蘇浙皖萬機械接收組說來，其工作情形極紛歧。但自敵偽接收過來的上海數家工廠，如滬西愛工等九工廠往往弄成一混亂的局面，而且照說某工廠剛整理完竣，卽欲復工或已復工多時，忽又被行政院派員來接收了。過去等等，以至最近的上海機破工程界尚不及敵僞時統轄下，一切都顯得雜亂無章，無頭無路。而上海的機械工程是中國的最繁感區。那末現在上海弄得這樣，其他的更何從說起呢。</p>
<p>（二）人材亟應加速訓練。在中國對於機械工程人材的缺乏，是太多太多了，這次敵偽接收過來的不少機械廠中，我們這裏根本沒有比較可以盡得了職的去接任。所以直到如今，那些日本的技術人材還存用着。而據最近的敎育部公佈謂，正擬增設工程學校，而加速訓練技術人材。但要知道相反的，這批訓練的敎師，是格外的缺乏，而且對於學生實騐，也是應該注意到的。但現在建築一所不成樣的學生工廠，起碼在五萬萬元上。</p>
<p>（三）機械工程人材及機匠等的待遇應提高，至少與公務人員同等待遇。而且對於生命也應該有一些保障。像現在一位廠長，工程師的薪給差不多還在十五萬元上下，而且一且失足被機器擠成肉漿，這也常有的了，這樣又誰來肯到機械工程來做事呢？</p>
<p>據很可靠的消息，這次我國要求日本將其國內所有大小五十萬餘架機械賠償這次我國的戰爭損失，這倒是樁很可喜的事吧！</p>

<p>— 淙</p>
<p>復員以還，雜誌報章上，關於「蠶桑」事業的文字，着實不少；這證明了國人的視綫已射到「蠶桑」事業上來了！我們如歸納這些「蠶桑」文獻，除一部份係報吿性質外，很多是强調着：「蠶桑」在中國的農，工，商業中，居於特殊重要的地位，目前是振興中國「蠶絲」事業的大好時機。當局應獎勵「桑蠶」事業，普設蠶絲學校，舉辦蠶業貸欵諸如此類的有利見地。筆者披閱之餘，復有補充小見兩點，添供本界人士及當局商榷於萬一。</p>
<p>（一）普及蠶絲敎育：要澈底提高「蠶桑」敎育，非全副一套的總動員不爲功，大學蠶桑敎育除求量的增加，質的方面，更需充實，用快跑的步伐，趕上世界的水準。中學蠶桑敎育，不僅多創專門學校，即普通中學校，應在生物學課程內，多量揷入「蠶桑」敎材，適合全國性的蠶桑事業的需要。至於小學，可能範團內灌輸普通蠶桑常識，對於那多數留在農村中的小學生們，似乎才是實際的加惠。</p>
<p>（二）解决樹桑問題：這個問題，就是解决桑田，桑苗的獲得間題，如果把現有的耕地，移作桑田，當然是剜肉補瘡，捨本逐末，摧殘農村，削弱生產，要不得的辦法。應該另行開源，正好利用不毛隙地——邱陸·沙灘·內河池沼的堤坡，鄉村住宅的近旁，公墓墳園的四週…等使地盡其用，而免貨棄於地。至於桑苗常然選擇優良品種，儘量供給，不數年後，可有「蠶桑王國」的雛形了。</p>
<p>筆者在這全國生產建設高潮之中，冒味提供上述兩點，庶表關心生產建設之忱，並希識者指敎之！</p>
<h3 id="c124">橫機襪廠的前途 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>我國自有針織工業以來，不過三四十年歷史，但手搖橫機舞襪廠的發軔，却還是近年來的事</p>
<p>針織工業，包括着一切編織工業，凡是編織衣類，一槪沒有經線，穿在身上，光滑舒適，像汗衫襪子等都堤，普通襪子，小腿上和脚脛上的針數是一樣的，也就是說，脚上粗的地方和細的地方，襪十根本是一樣大小的，不過在製造的時候，靠近襪口開鬆一些，以備穿下時伸大而已，但是硬伸大的襪子，穿在脚上，究竟美中不足，尤其婦女們的長統舞襪，大腿上和脚脛上的大小，相差不帝數倍，爲此之故，橫機舞襪廠，也就應運而生了。</p>
<p>橫綫舞襪，大腿部和脚脛部針數不同，從大腿開始，照大腿之粗細比例縮小，所以穿在脚上服貼舒適，爲一般婦女所樂用。</p>
<p>戰前，織這種舞襪的機械，是美國貨電機，出數很快，上海僅德豐針織廠有四台，太平洋戰起，因爲缺少零件關係，無形停頓，所以有人發明了一種手搖的橫機，每天每機約可做舞襪半打，出數雖慢，貨色却可與電機襪相仿，不過伸縮性稍差而已，所以前幾年因爲電機旣無形停頓，又無舶來品應市，因此上海手搖橫機襪廠，如雨後春筍盛極一時，茲海運雖通，但美貨尼籠絲襪須七萬元一雙，自織之舞襪僅一萬多元一雙，凡舞襪屬於奢侈品，政府禁止進口，所以手搖舞襪仍有銷路。上海橫機襪廠，現存約有卅多家，但範圍都很小，一打半打車子的居多，範圍較大者，當推合豐針織廠，該廠有手搖橫機五打之多，且有打線等一切附屬設備，所用原料「蠶絲」，都是該廠絲廠部自製。</p>
<p>手搖橫機舞襪，論出品雖屬奢侈品。但在外貨充斥之下，亦足挽回漏巵於萬一，且在電機廠不能設立之時。不失爲一種過渡之工具也。（任衡量）</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>有時候因爲經濟的關係，不能够買了空地建立廠房，那末就有下列幾種方法：</p>
<p>甲，租地造屋　向地主租借田地，訂定年限，每年的租金和期限届滿以後的辦法。</p>
<p>乙，購買現存廠房這也有二種情形，一種是連地的一種也是租地的。</p>
<p>丙，租借廠房在這種情形之下，就要考慮到將來的設備問題，因爲租借了一個廠房，一定要加以裝修或改裝，在合同裏面往往訂定在期滿以後租戶應裝還原狀，那末所裝進去的設備和裝修都要拆除，就不免要成爲一種損失，在事前不得不加以考慮。</p>
<p>B，廠房的式樣</p>
<p>廠房的用意：一所廠房的用意，是在遮蔽機器，設備，在製造中的原料，又和製成品，一個廠房必須具備下列的幾個條件：</p>
<p>甲，對於設備是一個良好的基礎。</p>
<p>乙，對於製造工作可以順利進行。</p>
<p>丙，有良好的通風設備，乾燥，充足的光綫，使工人能够舒適地做工。</p>
<p>丁，有充分的地方，可以貯藏原料和製成品。</p>
<p>以上四點，是一個廠房的基本條件，此外所化的金錢，那末是用在裝飾上或房屋的保護上的</p>
<p>B，廠房的式樣</p>
<p>製造廠的廠房，可以分爲三種，第一種是單層的廠屋，在屋頂成爲鋸齒形，這種屋頂通常稱爲Saw-Tooh　Rood</p>
<p>第二種是在上面用玻璃棚或屋頂的，在大廠房的兩旁，有時候配上較矮的廠房。</p>
<p>第三種是整幢的房屋。</p>
<p>在上述三種廠房之中，第一。第二。兩種，在建造的時候，比較便利，尤其適合於屬於臨時性的廠房，第三種整幢房屋，那末非求其堅固不可，牆壁·柱脚·地板·處處都須考慮到，但是也有一個地方，是可以减省建造的費用的，那就是屋頂數目的减省，因爲整　的房屋，祗需要少數的屋頂，不像第一種房屋，每一層需要一個屋頂。</p>
<p>終究應該選擇那一種廠房，就要看下列各種情形而定：</p>
<p>甲，空地有多少大，可以建造那一種廠房？</p>
<p>乙，所製造的貨品需要那一種廠房？</p>
<p>丙，經濟方面能够建造那一種廠房？</p>
<p>丁，時期方面（指租地等）以建造那一種廠房最適宜？</p>
<p>廠房裏應該考慮的其他各點。</p>
<p>甲，機器的重量：在有些製造廠裏，因爲機器的重量很輕，因此對於廠房的建造，就可以比較簡省一點，祇要能够容納工人，和必要的設備，不為風雨所侵，就已經足够了，但在需用很重的機器的工廠，那末廠房常然要力求堅固，此外凡是製造精巧的東西的廠屋，如鐘錶的製造廠，那末一點也不能有震動，震動的防止，並不是單純的堅固問題，這在建築專家是可以爲製造廠們設法解決的，好在在建造廠房之前，終得要建築師商酌，那時候就要把廠中的需要吿訴他，使他們所設計的廠房，能够符合廠方的需要。</p>
<p>乙，地板：有許多人對於水門汀地有一種不良的感覺，因爲是很寒冷的，這是因爲水門汀能吸引人的脚部的熱氣，同時一個人的步行，是與習慣有相常關係的，譬如說一個人慣在泥地行走，一旦他走上現代的街道時，他就容易發生疲勞。同樣的，一個慣在城市裏行走的人，到了鄉村裏去，走不上幾時，他也要感覺疲倦了。</p>
<p>同時慣用腦力做事的人，他們的脚容易寒冷，因爲他們身上的血液大部份到頭腦部份去了。</p>
<p>現代的建築物中，大部是用水門汀地，但如果經濟力量允許或是事實上需要，在水門汀上面仍舊可以裝置地板的。</p>
<p>在普通廠房，機器並不十分重大，那末木製地板較爲相宜，在單層的廠房，那末普通都用水門汀地的。</p>
<p>丙，防火問題：一個廠房，對於火災的防止是十分重要的。</p>
<p>通常情形可以把廠房分爲下列二種：</p>
<p>A緩燃性的：那是一些外面用磚牆的廠房，用木製窗門，相當地大，地板也用木製，這些廠房是容易着火的，不過，如果立刻救火，不致於完全燬滅，當然，在經過一次火災以後，牠的外表，是要受到極大的影響的。</p>
<p>B防火的：這是用鋼骨水泥建造的，所有窗門，都用鋼製，外面來的火災可以不受影響，大都是廠房裏面的東西着火的。</p>
<p>在現代的廠房中，當建造的時候，一個企業的主持人，常然要詳加考慮，在建造廠房的本身的需要外，應該用多少錢使廠房可以得到防火的功效，應該投保多少火險，同時在廠房裏應該裝置多少防火設備，如滅火機之類，一個廠房，是一個企業的生產地，安全和持久必須考慮到。</p>
<p>丁，溫度和通風：在製造廠裏溫度的保持是非常重要的，一則對於在進行中的工作有密切的關係，二則對於工人的工作效能，也有關係，如果在一個寒冷的天氣，而沒有爐子式水門汀，二人的工作效能立刻就要减退，同時有許多貨品的製造，對於溫度是很有關係的，不能忽冷忽熱。</p>
<p>此外廠房裏面的空氣，必須流通，使空氣新鮮，如果是空氣不流通，那末工作效能一定要減退，而且工人的身體健康，也是要設法加以保護的。</p>

<p>一方面，建築公司門可羅雀、建築師唉聲嘆氣，而空地上有一批無家可歸者搭蓋一些聊蔽風雨的棚屋，却要勒令拆除。不惜出動大批警察。</p>

<p>一個周末偶然的機會，我到了這一個地方。</p>
<p>假使你正有一個愛人，假使你正欲傾吐你的衷情，而且或者你還顧到她的羞澀，你將一定要拍案驚叫起來：什麼，竟有這末一個好地方！</p>
<p>是的，這假地方不太差吧——不，太好了！全室分成念個「房間」，（說「房間」，實在僅此隔一層薄板好一些）只中間一盞半明不滅的燈，分配人每一個房同內。昏黃與國沉籠單着，音樂沒有生脚跑不到這裏來，是的，這兒沒有很好的淸調，或者簡直沉悶得透不過氣來。然而你決，曾感到這些，你能感到的是亢奮。當你手臂上挽着的正是你熱度非常之高的愛人，你的心許會　腔而出呢！</p>
<p>當你倆坐下來，當你叫了某一件茶室中最簡單的東西；「跑孩」就永不再冒失的來碰一下你所已經佔有的門，一直等你興盡意倦幾個鐘點後撳電鈴吿訴他，你應當把你們的交易——二杯咖啡的價格——吿終的時候。</p>
<p>在這小房間巾，外面射不進一絲冒失而貪婪的眼。假使你來此已有一次的經騐，那末你將更會大胆地暢所欲爲。熱情放縱的高漲與環境壓力的衝動，使你會明白這種空間設置的用意。</p>
<p>飲品的價格是破格的高昂，他處祗售九百元一杯的咖啡，這兒售一千五。然而你並不感到這兒的東西太貴，因爲你太興奮了。你會同熱戀戀你的愛人同樣的熱戀這個地方。你下次還夢來，並且你也許會支使出更多的小帳叮囑「跑孩」在次日幾點鐘再留下一個座位。</p>
<p>這個咖啡館在什麼地方？你很想知道吧！要我吿訴你？然而到這裏我一定將要使你失望，因爲非但我還沒有膺任該咖啡館的義務宣傳員之職，而且，吿訴你也是徒勞。那兒每天覓不出一個多餘的座位，除了中間的幾個太平常的座位之外。然而假使你是一個聰明人兒，你自己也一定會去找到這樣相同的一個好「地方」。在爲了供應全市四百萬人口中若干龐大人數的需要起見，這種地方此比皆是！</p>

<p>青白自戰勝星東之後，氣勢一壯，形勢大變，日前星東有拉攥靑白隊員共赴澳洲之說，因此亦由談判困難而宣吿一時擱淺。蓋靑白隊自認賣力强硬，戰勝星島尤有餘力，寄人籬下，頗有不值之意，故對星東之一番盛意，紙有表示「心領」。星東隊之最大苦悶，由於門守一角，爲全隊中之最弱一點，深覺成事不足，敗事有餘，關係整個「命運」，實深且鉅，故頗有意另外物色一人，據聞渠等曾屬意於義僑門守台爾　卡，台爲義大利出席奧林匹克大會之選手，球　精　，固一此中老手也。但細細一想，事實土又覺不大妥當，堂堂羣人球隊中，坐道中殺出一個義大利程咬金來，似乎又有些不倫不類，頗感左右爲難之苦。如退一步再與靑白相謀，則靑白以戰勝者自居，胃口已大，事實上亦殊多困難。間時此去澳洲，勁旅甚多，如不幸顯幾砲放不驚，勢非虧本不可，當亦不便涉重洋而　萬險也。又靑白隊自與星東隊之合作流產後，觀乎星島隊之跑碼頭，頗有噱頭，因此亦有單獨進行出征澳洲之　，惟靑白隊之最大困難，資本欠離厚，同時入境澳洲，一筆押款，相當可觀，雖云戰勝星東，氣勢爲之一壯，但至澳洲後，是否絕對有把握，自覺亦有疑問，故心理上亦感到十一一分之矛盾。但退一步言之，雙方陣容，實際上皆有缺點，如各管單獨進行，則勢將兩敗俱傷，故爲遠征而談實際，兩隊合併實較合宜，而今雙方旣有各自爲政之意，則赴澳洲之計劃，即使做到，恐將難望有滿意之成續。以此推測，靑白隊雖有野心，但不知後台老闆，是否能爲此放心大胆，是亦值得耐人尋味之事也。</p>
<h3 id="c129">青山寺 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>流浪香港八九年，　盡人生苦况之外，嘗盡野蠻人給與的一切之外，有兩個去處是我最喜歡留戀的地方，一是近赤柱那邊的淺水灣，一是九龍以外的靑山寺。前者是近代都市文明享受的所在，後者則爲滌蕩煩慮的淸凉之所。四年前，上述的兩個地方我每年都得去幾次的，但每次全不用自己花錢（其實我也無錢可花），而且又是坐私家車去。淺水灣現且不去說它，靑山寺就有不少好處要說一說了。</p>
<p>我以前到青山去總是好幾個人，我是這一羣人裏面的陪客。先坐車到中環的統一碼頭，由小輪連人帶車載到九龍的尖沙嘴。車上了岸，照例先到彌敦道的咖喱飯店飽餐一回，再行電製風馳向九能屈曲的山道行駛，到了靑山碼頭，乘小艇到靑山鎭，從那兒步行而上靑山。上靑山有松徑可沿，也有半山亭可憩，一羣人慢慢兒走，走至大家身上出着毛毛汗時最是有趣。及至走到！先去用葵葉和竹蓋成的大「棚」子裏休息，知客僧招呼喝茶，凉沁沁地四　都有山風吹來，「棚」子又大，又不透着一點日光，坐久了不由得不會打瞌睡。我每次到那兒去都是在「棚」裏睡上一回，然後到各處略爲游散。嚴格地說，那兒並沒有可以游散的地方，祇有幾問寺堂，跟其他寺堂沒有兩樣的佛像，偶然也可以聽得一兩下鐘聲，也可能見到緇流在大殿上做午課。然而院宇比南京的靈谷寺多，同時它又是倚在半山，氣勢就自然不同了。寺後有個不大深的岩穴，放着一條大魚骨，有好幾尺長，寺僧稱它爲能骨。另有一座小殿，由一個老尼主持，是善男信女們求簽問卜的所在。更有一塊岩石，刻上「天下第一山」五個大字，據說是韓文公的手筆。我不曾加過考據。</p>
<p>從寺遠望，很顯得雄闊，且這山命名的來由，則頗可引起人們的興趣。但這些，我不願意去說它。主持在粵僧羣中據說頗有來頭，寺產也相當豐饒，聞已爲主持的侄兒耗去了不少。知客僧是一個俗不可耐的傢伙，但他學得了幾句「麻衣」，遙着施主們老是說上兩句，也至多是兩句。信不信由你。</p>
<p>游靑山寺照例吃一頓午「齋」，（廣東人說吃素爲吃齋），在人們一到犬「棚」子時，那知客僧就來接洽的了。「齋」的味兒很是可口，尤其在吃慣了葷的人去偶然吃上一頓更是有味，那兒也有酒喝，在喝上有三分酒意時會使你更見到靑山寺的好處。</p>
<p>一句話，游靑山寺可使人渾忘俗慮”爲的是環境很幽，沒有趨炎逐臭和攘權奪利的現象。但不能使你忘懷了自已。</p>
<p>我早就想到那兒去養病，我認定它是香港最適宜養病的地方，可我沒有到那兒去養病的財力</p>
<p>四年多來我差不多對它忘懷了，原因在四年裏面在香港的人誰也沒有去靑山寺的自由，也沒有去靑山的便利，就算現在罷，人們對它還是裹足不前，這大好的名山，這大好的名剎，祗能讓樵夫牧子去享受。爲的是交通，也爲的是治安未曾恢復。</p>
<h3 id="c130">個性之謎 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>杜克大學的心理學敎授，及個性問題權威，雷蒙·卡特爾博士，最近研究成功一種新的個性制度—用簡單的數目字，來表現一個人的個性特徵。</p>
<p>爲了容易明瞭卡氏的這種新制度起見，我們姑且假定，世界上，每個人都有一個「個性號碼」，係運動員背心上的號碼一樣，你看見那個高個子背上的「二九一一一」，你立刻可以斷定，「他是一個有頭腦的人，但，別的可就沒有甚麼了」。</p>
<p>另外一個傢伙，是「八一三五四」，表示他的智力很低，但品性却很好。如果有兩個女孩子走過來，一個是「四四九八一」，一個是「四四一二九」，你可以知道，前面一個，性喜多疑，而且孤僻；後面一個，却有一顆愉快的，愛好社交的靈魂。</p>
<p>當然，這種個性號碼公開示衆，是決不可能的。不過，它可以帮助個人選擇職業，也有助於選擇適當人材，擔任公衆機關的職務。</p>
<p>卡特爾博士說，「也許有一天，需要心理學家來測定政界候選人的個性特徵。」</p>
<p>卡氏在得到這個簡單的制度之前，做過許多緊瑣的預備工作。他先從字典中選出所有指述個性的字眼，約有四千個以上，然後把相似的逐漸削去，最後减到一百七十一個。</p>
<p>第二步，以這一百七十一個個性特徵，測騐過好幾百人。從這裏可以看出，那幾種特徵常常連在一起，再度加以减削。</p>
<p>做完了最後的統計分析，卡特爾博士又完成了十二種基本個性因數，從這裏，可以測出個性的主要特徵。</p>
<p>比如，有一個人是波希米亞型，他的個性中，下列各特繳，表現得最爲強烈：歡樂，好心腸，感情豐富，不拘禮節，隨和。</p>
<p>卡特爾博士把每個人的個性，用一個數目方程式來表現，例如，有一個人，是“5w，8g，4f，1p2c”就可以知道，他是一個品性良善，智力很高，直爽，但並不十分善於交際的人。</p>
<p>「專實上，任何問題的終極，都是一個個性問題，」卡特爾博士說，「不論你是研究戰爭的原因，改良敎育，或失業問題，最後，都與個性有關。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Three-Person Meeting Continued Yesterday; A Comprehensive Review of Transportation Issues; Communist Troops Still Refuse to Withdraw from Railway Lines <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Today is a regular Sunday holiday. The government and CCP representatives participating in the military three-person meeting went separately to Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road at 10 a.m. to await the start of the meeting. Following his custom, Marshall went to the military church for worship, and then quickly returned to his residence. The meeting then continued at 10:25 a.m. It is reported that today's meeting conducted a comprehensive review of the issue of restoring transportation. The meeting lasted for two hours and twenty-five minutes, with two breaks in between. The results of the meeting have not been announced. According to well-informed sources, the two sides reached a basic consensus on the removal of bunkers and the standardization of road administration. However, the withdrawal of Communist troops from the railway lines involved the issue of Communist troop stationed areas, and the two sides debated fiercely. It is reported that this matter will be discussed as a special case tomorrow. Only when this problem is resolved can a satisfactory agreement be reached.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The second meeting of the military three-person meeting held this morning was still chaired by General Marshall. The government representative present was Minister of Communications Yu Dawei. Government attendees included Vice Minister of Communications Ling Hongxun, Director Shi Zhiren, Counselor Bai Zonggan, Director of the First Department of the Ministry of National Defense Xu Langxuan, and Guo Ruhua. CCP attendees included Deputy Chief of Staff Teng Daiyuan and Huang Yifeng and three others. It is reported that Vice Minister Ling brought detailed reports on the damage to various railways awaiting repair and various reference charts and statistical data. The CCP side also brought various reports on the current situation of various sections within the Communist army occupied areas. After the meeting began, Marshall paid close attention to the extent of damage to roadbed sleepers, rails, bridges, culverts, station buildings, and factories. He inquired in particular about the distances between the troop stationed areas of both sides along each route, and frequently stood up to survey various charts temporarily hung in the room for reference. When he learned that the Jinpu, Longhai, and other routes had been damaged dozens or even hundreds of times, he sighed at length, as if deeply saddened.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] It is reported that Zhou Enlai and Yu Dawei met yesterday afternoon around 3 p.m., and separately visited Marshall's residence to discuss the issues of Marshall's arbitration authority, the three issues related to cease-fire, road restoration, and military reorganization, and the issue of Communist army stationed areas, and to exchange opinions. It is understood that the CCP also put forward a new proposal regarding Marshall's arbitration authority. It is reported that the CCP only recognizes that the US representative has the power of execution and interpretation, and still insists that the final decision should be made by the three-party representatives. This is a significant difference from the government's position that the final decision should be determined by the majority. If this matter cannot be resolved quickly, it may become a major stumbling block in the meeting. According to a neutral person, the CCP has repeatedly praised Marshall as the most impartial mediator and has repeatedly expressed trust in and admiration for Marshall. Therefore, it should not be insincere and deliberately use this difficult problem to carry out its conspiracy of negotiating while fighting.</p>
<p>Yu Dawei Visited the Chairman After the Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] After the meeting of the three-person group adjourned today, reporters met with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei at his private residence. Mr. Yu stepped out of the car with the lightest of steps, appearing carefree and very happy. Reporters focused on the "transportation" issue, which was the focus of today's meeting, and immediately asked for Mr. Yu's opinion. Mr. Yu said, "Reporting my happy attitude to the readers is enough for them to know a glimpse of the meeting." He then laughed and said, "I have never been so happy as I am today." Finally, he added, "Good news can be announced on June 30th." It is reported that Mr. Yu was busy all day today and visited the Chairman twice after the meeting to discuss matters. It is reported that the three-person meeting will continue to discuss transportation issues tomorrow morning. It is understood that a partial agreement was reached today.</p>
<p>Government Representatives Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng held a meeting this morning to discuss the content of the proposal put forward by CCP representative Zhou Enlai and exchange opinions. After the meeting, the original proposal was submitted to Chairman Chiang. The fourth point in the proposal, regarding the convening of the second Political Consultative Conference, was reserved. It was said that this issue could be left for discussion by the various parties after the military issue is resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Ministry of National Defense Spokesman Denounces the CCP's Suggestions; Communist Troops Repeatedly Violate the Cease-Fire Order; Now They Are Creating Extraneous Issues in an Attempt to Delay <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Today, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued an important statement: Recounting how, since the first cease-fire agreement was issued on January 10th of this year, and after the second cease-fire public announcement was issued on June 6th, Communist troops have repeatedly violated the cease-fire order, expanded their troops without authorization, attacked the National Army, destroyed transportation, attacked towns, and detained or harmed government and American group representatives. All the facts of violating orders, breaking faith, and harming the people are listed. The spokesperson also refuted the four suggestions proposed by the CCP in its letter to the Chairman after the announcement of the third cease-fire order, considering them to be faithless, attempting to create extraneous issues, and deliberately delaying. In particular, the fourth item is even more empty. For example, advocating for reopening the Political Consultative Conference and reorganizing the government before military conflicts cease equates political issues with the urgent task of ceasing fire. Their delaying tactics are very obvious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense stated a moment ago: On the 21st of this month, the government, with the utmost forbearance, extended the deadline for the order to cease pursuit and advance by another eight days before the expiration of the fifteen-day period. This move was indeed giving the Communist Party another chance to awaken. However, the CCP representatives sent a letter to the government representatives, putting things upside down and creating new problems. The facts that are known to the world can prove that the CCP's move is clearly lacking sincerity and is intended to delay. The CCP delegation stated in its letter: "The military reorganization plan proposed by the government side was completely unexpected, attempting to move the CCP troops out of the major cities and railway lines during the military reorganization period in order to eliminate them," etc. Their intention is obviously to permanently occupy the major cities and railway lines that were illegally seized by the Communist troops after the Japanese surrender, creating a situation of separatism, unwilling to obey the government's dispatch. This not only undermines the unification of military and political orders, but also wants to create obstacles to the basic principles of the military reorganization plan agreed upon by both sides, and completely expresses their lack of sincerity for peace with the resolute tone of "cannot be considered." The letter also stated: "If the ceasefire is not implemented immediately, the people will suffer, the country will be devastated, and the bleak future is truly unimaginable." If the Communist Party's intention is expressed in good faith, then after January 10th of this year, the facts of the Communist army's expanding its troops, attacking the National Army, destroying transportation, attacking cities and towns, and detaining or harming government and American group representatives, etc., which all violate the cease-fire order, I wonder how the Communist Party representatives will explain themselves. Even in terms of recent facts, since the second announcement of the cease-fire order on June 7th, the National Army, except for self-defense, all units have firmly defended their original defenses and have not pursued or attacked. On the contrary, the Communist army has launched a full-scale offensive. For example, in the Northeast, they seized Fuyu, Taolaizhao, Lafa, etc. In eastern Hebei, they are currently concentrating a large amount of military force in the area north of Lulong and Luanxian, intending to cut off the traffic on the Beining Road. In Shanxi, they seized Yixian and Shuoxian. In Shandong, they are particularly active. On the Jinpu Line, they seized Dezhou, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang, etc. On the Jiaoji Line, they seized Mingshui, Longshan, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Jiaozhou, Chengyang, and other stations, and besieged Jinan with 100,000 troops and attacked Huangbu and Baihe Water Source in Qingdao with 60,000 troops, surrounding Qingdao, and continued to destroy the important railway lines in North China. For example, on the Pinghan Line, from Yuanshi in the south to Fengle, a distance of more than 200 kilometers, is occupied by the Communist army, and repair is not allowed. The Niucheng Wenxi section and the Wenxi Shicun section of the Tongpu Line have recently been destroyed by the Communist army. On the Jinpu Line, in addition to the area near Jinan, from Dangjiazhuang in the south to Liguo Station north of Xuzhou, and from Sangzidian in the north to Cangxian in Hebei, are all destroyed by the Communist army in sections and cannot be repaired to this day. After the Ministry of Communications made its best efforts to repair the Jiaoji Line, almost all of it was open to traffic. However, recently the Communist army, in order to cut off the traffic between Qingdao and Jinan, not only seized important stations along the line, but also destroyed them again. After the second ceasefire order, the Communist army not only continued to perform its old trick of seizing cities and railways and destroying transportation, but also openly harmed government group members Major Lei Fenqiang and Guo Ziqi, the translator of the Xinxiang group. These are all current facts. The so-called agreement to ceasefire by the Communist Party representatives is still an attempt to cover up its consistent trick of freely attacking the National Army and allowing the National Army to be defeated on all sides. Furthermore, the four items proposed by the CCP representatives in their recommendations cannot avoid betraying the facts, attempting to create extraneous issues, and deliberately delaying.

<h3 id="e3">Understanding the Suffering of the People in the Northeast; Hoping the CCP Acts Prudently; Wan Fulin Claims to Advocate Organizing and Training the Masses <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yang, 23rd Dispatch] Mr. Wan Fulin, a member of the Political Committee of the Northeast Xingying, told reporters that people in the Northeast currently hope that Mr. Mo Dehui will come to the Northeast as soon as possible. He has already asked General Ma Zhanshan, who is going to Beijing, to convey this intention to Mr. Mo Dehui. It is generally believed that Mr. Mo understands the situation in his hometown better than others. Mr. Wan returned to his hometown in the Northeast for the first time after the restoration of the Northeast, and many local elders and villagers were delighted to meet him. He said that in the future, he is willing to contribute his humble opinions to the authorities in order to benefit the local area. He also said: The current situation in the Northeast really needs peace, and I especially hope that the Communist Party understands the suffering of the people and acts prudently. I advocate organizing and training the masses, which has been adopted by Chairman Chiang, because the military force is limited, but the power of the masses is infinite.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The So-Called "People's Representatives" Are Accused by Refugees from Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>A Tragic and Passionate Scene at Zhenjiang Station</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Ma Xulun and his party have been escorted into the city by the security authorities. Ma and others were questioned by refugees at the station, and fortunately no accidents occurred. However, the emotions of the refugees were very agitated. The authorities will decide how to deal with Ma and others after verifying their identities.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] More than ten people, including Ma Xulun, Bao Dasan, Chen Zhenzhong, Kui Yanfang, Hu Ziying, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Tongbo, Chen Lifu, Yan Baohang, and Lei Jieqiong, who claimed to be people's representatives, came to Nanjing from Shanghai today, claiming to be representatives of more than fifty people's organizations in Shanghai, to oppose the civil war and petition the government, the CCP, and Marshal Marshall. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, because the refugees did not yet know that Ma and others were self-proclaimed representatives, thousands of refugees from northern Jiangsu gathered at Zhenjiang Station and sent five representatives to demand three points: (1) Please ask Ma Xulun to get off the train and talk. (2) Please ask Mr. Ma to listen to the refugees' reports on the atrocities of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, and please convey them to Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall, asking them to send them back to their hometowns. At that time, Ma Xulun claimed that he was representing the people of Shanghai to go to Beijing and refused to get off the train. At that time, some refugees even wanted to lie down on the railway track to beg Mr. Ma to get off the train. Fortunately, the station staff conveyed their request politely, and the train was able to leave. Ma and others arrived in Beijing at 7 o'clock. As soon as they arrived at the platform, refugees from northern Jiangsu who had gathered at the station complained to Ma and others, saying, "If you are people's representatives, please take us to see Zhou Enlai and ask him to answer our questions about restoring traffic and stopping conflicts." Ma replied that he was going to visit Chairman Chiang, since the crowd was agitated and he could not cope with it. The crowd shouted, "If you don't take us refugees to see Zhou Enlai, then you are not real representatives!" Then the refugees shouted, "We don't want democratic swindlers. We ordinary people and elementary school students cannot be your political gambling capital for a lifetime." At that time, the crowd was boiling and pushing each other. Then someone pretended to shout, "The representatives have been beaten." However, when this newspaper's reporter saw Mr. Ma in a reception room at the station, he only saw that he was tired. Then Yan Baohang, one of the so-called representatives, waved his hands and lectured on a makeshift table, attracting the crowd. At that time, the crowd at the station had reached thousands. Every time they heard him claim to be a people's representative, they shouted, "Take out your credentials!" The refugee representatives who were organized spontaneously also made several demands as follows: (1) The Communist army must withdraw from northern Jiangsu. (2) The Communist army must stop the physical consolation of women. (3) Stop the struggle. (4) Do not forcibly conscript men. (5) We want to go home and have security. (6) Stop the bloody struggle. They also made demands of the representatives of the Democratic League: (1) Do not be the tail of the Communist Party. (2) Stop all political activities in schools. (3) We want to study. (4) We want peaceful unification, not internal chaos. At this time, Ma Xulun, who claimed to be a people's representative, had nothing to say and dared not meet the crowd. At this time, the refugees could not avoid chaos due to grief and disappointment, so the unfortunate incident of some three reporters being mistakenly beaten occurred. Several reporters went to meet Ma and others, and the crowd misunderstood. This also shows that the emotions of the crowd cannot be violated. As of 11 p.m., the Xiaguan Station was still at a stalemate, and the order was maintained by the railway police. This scene of the struggle between "true democracy" and "false democracy" lasted until midnight.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Chairman Visited Linggu Temple Yesterday <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang visited Linggu Temple at 7 p.m. on the 23rd, which was the first suburban outing after the Chairman returned to the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Northeast Executive Team is Active; Representatives Depart to Prepare for Work <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] The extension of the cease-fire order has given the Northeast Executive Team an opportunity to be active. Sixteen CCP representatives in Shenyang have gone to Changchun, and another ten will go soon to prepare to work with government and American representatives in various places. Wang Tianren and others from the 30th Team will go to Haicheng, and Cai Wanyou from the 29th Team has transferred from Siping to Hailong. Another group of government personnel left Ping for Shenyang and then transferred to Changchun the night before yesterday, accompanied by Chen Gonghui and others from the 36th Team. However, it is reported that the Communist Party refused to allow government team representatives to go to Harbin, so the Northeast military authorities also refused Communist representatives to go to Haicheng, and offered to allow government representatives to go to Harbin as an exchange condition. This is the reason why the Haicheng team departed later. Du Yuming said that he had received the order to extend the cease-fire on the evening of the 21st and had ordered compliance. However, he said that he would no longer say much in the future to avoid misunderstandings, but he claimed that the authorities' determination to take over the sovereignty of the Northeast has not changed and that if there is no result after the 30th, they will continue to advance.</p>

<h3 id="e20">U.S. State Department Releases Secret Documents on the Northeast Incident, Detailing U.S. Diplomatic Activities in 1931, Stimson as a Strong Behind-the-Scenes Figure in the League of Nations at the Time <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Secret documents released by the State Department today regarding the Northeast Incident in China in 1931 reveal that then-Secretary of State Stimson spared no effort to seek peaceful coexistence with Japan. Stimson was Secretary of War when the Pearl Harbor incident occurred. The documents declare that Stimson felt that Japan's actions in the Northeast were difficult to "appropriately mediate," but believed that China's excessive "hostility" towards Japan was also one of the causes of the Northeast Incident. He also accused China of "eagerly trying to involve all the countries of the world in the whirlpool to fight against Japan." The document quotes Stimson as saying: "We should sympathize with this matter, but we do not want to fight Japan."</p>
<p>The document only covers the first three months of the Northeast Incident. Japan invaded the Northeast on September 18, 1931. Two months later, the Council of the League of Nations met twice in Paris to consider the situation of the incident. The document reveals for the first time in detail that Stimson played a strong behind-the-scenes role in the activities of the League of Nations, although the United States had not yet joined the League of Nations at this time. The document declares that Stimson actually "manipulated" most of the League of Nations' activities regarding the Northeast Incident, but was not responsible himself. Stimson also ordered General Charlie David, the informal liaison representative of the United States to the League of Nations at the time, to "grab the collar" of French representative Briand, the chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, to prevent the League of Nations from "acting too hastily" against Japan. He feared that the League of Nations' strong actions would make Japan "ignite."</p>
<p>He also opposed economic sanctions against Japan, because this would be "the first step towards war against Japan." He believed that the League of Nations must be prevented from sending a military investigation team to the Northeast. Stimson told David: "The only thing we care about in the Northeast is to prevent war. We do not care what the result of the solution is, as long as China and Japan can negotiate peacefully."</p>
<p>The document declares that Stimson's advice was encouraged by representatives of the Council of the League of Nations. At the end of 1931, Chinese government officials accused the United States of "sabotaging" what they believed could have been obtained, the League of Nations' "severe condemnation" of Japan. The document states: Stimson secretly "cooperated" with the League of Nations to a greater extent than Americans might have approved if they had known. Stimson did not approve of the League of Nations taking strong action against Japan, but advocated direct negotiations between China and Japan. Japan then voted to reject the League of Nations' proposal to urge it to negotiate and immediately withdraw its troops from the Northeast. The United Kingdom then proposed making some concessions to Japan.</p>
<p>Stimson tried to arrange direct talks with neutral observers. He said: "If Japan refuses, it should be regarded as illegal, and under the effective resistance of China and the spiritual pressure of the world, it should feel besieged on all sides."</p>
<p>In the secret documents published today, there are countless parts that show sympathy for Japan, express regret for its invasion of the Northeast, and are impatient with the Chinese government's "endless long speeches" complaining to Japan.</p>
<p>A month after Japan invaded the Northeast, William Castle, then Deputy Secretary of State, told the Japanese ambassador: "If you think that we hope that the Japanese will withdraw from the Northeast, this is completely wrong... We certainly should not urge or even suggest that Japan completely withdraw from the Northeast, because the Japanese army is in the Northeast based on the provisions of the treaty, which is very obvious."</p>
<p>Castle also told the Japanese ambassador that the United States' opinion on the Northeast Incident was quite "restrained," because many people knew that "the Japanese in the Northeast had endured a lot and continue to exist with troubles."</p>
<p>The secret documents declare that Stimson's actions in the Northeast Incident are very different from those described in his own book "The Crisis in the Far East." In this book, Stimson narrates that he tried to make the British government take strong measures against Japan, but as a result of the British side's cold response, he had to abandon his plan.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Concluding a Far East Four-Power Pact <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>It has been nearly ten months since the Japanese bandits surrendered and were under the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. The purpose of the Allied control of Japan: in addition to disarming Japan, it is also necessary to reform the threat of Japanese politics. We review General MacArthur's work in controlling Japan, and in these ten months, he has achieved considerable success in eliminating the remnants of the Japanese warlords, eradicating the people's aggressive ideology, and reforming the Japanese political system. However, this control method is not a long-term solution. In order to establish a century-old plan for peace in the Far East, the U.S. State Department has drafted a twenty-five-year treaty for the four powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to disarm Japan, and notified the governments of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union as the basis for the future Far East Four-Power Pact. Today, when the Far East Peace Conference has not yet been convened, the United States' proposal of this Four-Power Pact plan is even more worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>According to the full text of the Four-Power Pact draft released by the U.S. Information Service, summarized, there are the following key points: (1) Establish a four-power control committee to supervise Japan's disarmament and domestic non-defense; (2) Disarm all of Japan's army, navy, and air force, and dissolve the Imperial Headquarters and the General Staff Headquarters, and do not allow the establishment of military or paramilitary institutions, prohibit the manufacture and import of arms, and do not establish naval, land, or air bases; (3) If Japan takes actions that damage or violate this treaty, the signatory countries must immediately take necessary actions in the naval, land, and air forces to stop it; but the measures taken must be reported to the United Nations Security Council; (4) The validity period of the treaty is limited to twenty-five years, and a four-power conference should be convened six months before the expiration date to determine whether the treaty needs to be amended or extended.</p>
<p>From these four key points, its nature is roughly the same as the twenty-five-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes at the last Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference; its purpose is clearly to prevent the resurgence of aggressive forces and to lay a solid foundation for peace in the Far East. Although the current situation in the Far East has changed due to Japan's defeat, looking to the future, the key to whether peace in the Far East can be maintained for a long time is still in Japan. We should not ignore the defeated Japan in the slightest. On the surface, Japan is enduring the bitter fruits caused by defeat, but in their hearts, they seem to have not yet admitted defeat and firmly believe that after another ten or twenty years, Japan will be able to regroup and determine the outcome. Therefore, the key to peace in the Far East still depends on the effectiveness of the four-power control of Japan. In view of the outbreak of the Second European War, we believe even more that peace must be built on a reasonable basis to be maintained permanently. In dealing with Japan, if one appeals to reason, or relies solely on emotions, and gives the most severe and harsh treatment, or the great powers do not act in unison, or even secretly support Japan's resurgence, then the Germany after the First World War can serve as a warning. Therefore, how to deal with the defeated Japan is not a simple problem, and its impact is even more closely related to our China.</p>
<p>The Four-Power Pact draft proposed by the United States is generally satisfactory, and the governments of China and Britain have also expressed their agreement in principle. The only issue is the Soviet Union, which has not yet replied, and it is not yet known whether it agrees or not. This newspaper's editorial has pointed out more than once that the Soviet Union needs to participate in a twenty-five-year alliance to jointly prevent the resurgence of Germany and Japan. Looking at the recent developments in the international political situation, for the sake of peace in Europe and for the sake of security in the Far East, the Soviet Union should support the two Four-Power Pact drafts successively proposed by the United States. How to deal with the problem of Germany is now left aside for the time being, but how to clean up the defeated Japan is indeed the most serious problem in the Far East at present. We browse modern history, and after each international war, a peace conference is immediately convened to clean up the post-war international mess and seek temporary peace and stability, but the situation after the result of this war is very different. In Europe, Germany surrendered nearly a year ago, but the four powers cannot fully agree to convene a twenty-one-nation peace conference, which remains to be decided by the foreign ministers' conference. In the Far East, because the European stalemate cannot be broken, the Far East issue is even more difficult to resolve, and the general situation is chaotic and needs to be clarified quickly. The U.S. proposal is a very wise move and will make a great contribution to the future situation in the Far East. Soviet diplomats are of course very aware of this, and if the Soviet Union expresses its agreement, it will be the starting point for cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East, and it is also a turning point in the world situation from "division" to "unity."</p>
<p>The post-war situation in the Far East is because the United States and the Soviet Union have different opinions on Japan, Korea, and the Northeast issue in our country, and there is almost a situation of accumulating incompatibility. After the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, a temporary compromise was reached on the issues disputed by both sides, and the situation in the Far East was also full of bright and peaceful scenes. However, in the past six months, these issues have not been thoroughly resolved, especially the issue of Japan. The Soviet Union often blames the United States for "taking over," and the United States is also wary of the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to correct the source, it is indeed urgent for the four powers to sign a treaty to supervise Japan's disarmament and prevent the resurgence of aggressive forces.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the two Four-Power Pact drafts proposed by the United States can be established at the same time, so as to establish two solid pillars for European peace and Far East security.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] Xibao and Daxibao newspapers in this city were destroyed by more than 200 students from the 17th Army Officers Corps at 11:00 AM on the 23rd because they published news on the 22nd about "military-like people behaving lawlessly." The business, editorial, and printing departments of Xibao were destroyed, and two senior employees were seriously injured, with losses of more than 100 million yuan. For a time, the people of the whole city were panicked and warned each other to close the market. The society was in a chaotic state. Military police were dispatched unarmed to persuade them, but they were also beaten. A major general senior officer of the Officers Corps suppressed the scene, but not only did it not work, but he was also insulted. The situation only eased slightly at about 1:00 PM.

<p>[This City Report] Wuxi Xibao and Daxibao were suddenly wantonly destroyed by more than 200 students from the 17th Demobilized Officers Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs at about 12:00 noon yesterday (23rd).</p>
<p>Military Officer Corps Students Disturbing the People Was Published in the Newspaper</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai office of Xibao: The 17th Demobilized Officers Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs, with about 4,000 people, has been living in the Xixiang area of Wuxi. Rong Shixing, a farmer from four households in Wubao and Shisijia, Rongxiang Town, was living in the home of Wu Longbang, a member of the corps. A few days ago, due to a minor incident, he had a quarrel with Rong, and gathered more than a dozen companions to drag Rong out and beat him severely, which aroused a unanimous market strike by the villagers in the town, demanding punishment for the murderer. The reporter reported the facts truthfully, and the newspapers published it on the 22nd. Tao Liu, the commander of the Officers Corps, learned of this and summoned local people in the afternoon to inquire about the truth. Unexpectedly, more than 100 students under the command of the corps destroyed the reporter's residence, Erjia, a local store, and the town government.

<p>More than 200 People Commit Murder, Two Newspapers Are Almost Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, more than 200 students of the corps had already sneaked into the city, first went to Daxibao, and wantonly destroyed the furniture, doors and windows of the business department and editorial department. The newspaper immediately reported to the city defense department, and more than 30 armed soldiers from the department rushed to suppress it, but they were outnumbered and helpless. As a result, one inspector and one member were beaten and injured. Afterwards, the students rushed to the Xibao hall in swarms. At that time, the newspaper had closed the gate tightly. The students immediately climbed over the wall and entered, and first destroyed all the front door department, business department, editorial department, general manager's office, telecommunications room, data room, and kitchen. The students who caused the trouble said that the staff of the newspaper hall had heard the news and temporarily avoided them. Some of them turned to the county government and stated that they wanted the county magistrate to hand over the presidents and editors-in-chief of the newspapers. Because the county magistrate was not there, they could not get what they wanted, so they returned to the Xibao printing department and destroyed the typesetting room, casting equipment, and so on. Zhu Xuequan (currently a county senator), the manager of the newspaper printing department, and one worker were injured because they could not escape. Another three workers were slightly injured. It lasted for more than an hour before they left triumphantly.</p>
<p>Commander Tang Was Furious, Guaranteed to Punish the Murderers and Compensate</p>
<p>When the incident happened, the local military police were isolated and weak and could not suppress it. The local people rushed to report the incident, and the order was very chaotic. After Commander Tang was reported, he was furious and immediately drove to personally inspect the damage. At the same time, he immediately summoned the relevant leaders and the persons in charge of the victimized newspaper to talk and firmly declared: (1) Be responsible for punishing the murderers, (2) Compensate for the losses, (3) Absolutely guarantee freedom of the press, (4) Absolutely guarantee the safety of news personnel. From now on, each newspaper will send special armed soldiers to protect them. The detailed method will be discussed in detail at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The participants expressed their admiration for Commander Tang's fair measures. All the newspapers in Wuxi originally intended to suspend publication unanimously, as a rear guard, but they were touched by Commander Tang's enthusiasm for the newspaper industry and decided to continue publishing as usual. In addition to issuing a joint edition and waiting for a legal solution, the Xibao board of directors convened a meeting overnight to report to Chairman Wu Zhihui and ask for instructions on the aftermath. Daxibao also urgently telegraphed the publishers Wu Shaoshu and Yao Dongsheng to ask for instructions.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 23rd - Broadcasting: The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference has entered its final stage. Starting tomorrow, the foreign ministers will meet twice daily, hoping to conclude negotiations by the end of next week.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is currently striving to convene a peace conference of 21 European nations on July 15th of this year. This matter was suggested by the US delegation and agreed to in principle by the British and French delegations. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed dissent, preventing an agreement from being reached. When US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed the above suggestion, he pointed out that the entire peace plan should be drafted before the UN General Assembly convenes in September of this year. He also stated that the issues of Germany and Austria should be submitted for review only after the invitations to the 21-nation peace conference have been issued. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov disagreed, stating that many important issues in the various peace treaties remain to be resolved, and it would be dangerous to immediately determine the date for convening the conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then proposed postponing the final decision on convening the conference for another week. Regarding the issues of the borders of Austria and the disposition of the Italian fleet, a comprehensive consideration was not possible because the report to be submitted by the committee of experts has not yet been completed. Regarding the issue of the Dodecanese Islands' affiliation, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov requested a postponement of the discussion, stating that he would consult with the Greek Ambassador to France this afternoon. The next meeting of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled for the 24th of this month, at which time the issues of the borders of Italy and Austria, the borders of France and Italy, and the distribution of the Italian fleet will be discussed. As suggested by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Four Power Foreign Ministers also decided to hold two meetings daily.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] It was previously reported that the Four Power Foreign Ministers would prepare to accept the compromise of international co-management of Trieste, which is the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia that has stalled the Italian peace treaty. However, no decision has yet been reached on this compromise, and only preliminary opinions have been exchanged. It is expected that the Four Power Foreign Ministers will take advantage of Sunday to consult with the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia on how to resolve this compromise, and a draft is expected to be prepared in the early part of next week.</p>

In addition, the Italian government has sent a memorandum to the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris regarding the economic and financial clauses included in the new armistice agreement with Italy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Italy presented the Foreign Ministers Conference with a note protesting the decision to postpone the discussion of colonial issues for another year, during which time the peace treaty with Italy will be signed, and Italy will relinquish all sovereignty over its colonies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 22nd] Regarding the issue of Italy's western border, the Italian Socialist Party recently held a meeting and issued a communiqué protesting the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference's willingness to sacrifice a portion of the Italian people. It stated, "The Socialist Party's design committee will seek a fair peace for the Italian people. The Italian people should be considered victims of Fascism, not accomplices."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The Hungarian delegation, led by Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, concluded discussions with British officials in London after 36 hours and left for Paris today.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 22nd] Nehru, the leader of the Indian Congress Party, who was arrested in Kashmir Province a few days ago, has been released and flew here on Indian Governor-General Wavell's special plane today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 22nd] The final decision of the Congress Party Executive Committee on the proposal to establish a provisional government was postponed due to Nehru's departure from New Delhi. Governor-General Wavell originally set tomorrow as the deadline for submitting a reply. Therefore, after consulting with Gandhi, Abate telegraphed Nehru to return quickly. Nehru replied yesterday afternoon to the Congress Party Executive Committee, stating that you and the Congress Party have a long-standing relationship, and the needs of the party should be placed above all our feelings. Your honor is our honor, and your obedience to the party makes our party responsible for protecting your honor. The Executive Committee is very concerned about the welfare of Abdullah and the people of Kashmir and hopes that you will return to New Delhi to participate in the Congress Party Executive Committee's final decision on the Governor-General's proposal.

<p>Says World Peace is Indivisible</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd]</p>
<p>The United Nations Association held its first annual conference here. The association's chairman, Viscount Cecil, former chairman of the British League of Nations Union, delivered a speech stating that he did not claim to fully understand Soviet policy, but the Soviet Union had many reasons to expect peace. It is known that the Soviet government owns vast lands and must maintain peace in order to develop them. In the initial stages, it seemed to have contributed greatly to supporting international peace organizations. However, the stability of international organizations depends on appropriate compromises and the concept of the highest interests of peace, rather than the security of one country. Peace is indivisible, although it is the saying of a Soviet citizen (referring to former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov), it seems that the Soviet side has not widely recognized it, which is somewhat regrettable. In today's world, if countries cannot establish international agreements with the Soviet Union, but establish such agreements outside the Soviet Union, it would be the greatest misfortune. Personally, I hope and believe that this unfortunate event will not happen. If it does happen, our responsibility for peace will not be reduced, but rather increased. We must not relax our efforts to ensure the success of the United Nations, but rather intensify them. If we want to maintain peace, we must do so through international action, and only international action can do so.</p>

<p>[US Information Agency, Washington, 22nd] The Department of the Army announced tonight that 90 percent of the world's pre-war illegal drug trade, at its source in Japan, has been eliminated. Colonel Sams, currently in New York attending the United Nations Health Conference, Director of Public Health and Welfare under MacArthur for five years, described the US Army's activities in controlling narcotics in his report.

<h3 id="e44">Atomic Bomb Tests Purely Experimental and Harbor Attack Styles Conducted Twice Next Month <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, aboard the USS Appalanche, atomic bomb test observation ship at Bikini Atoll, 22nd] This ship carries over 150 reporters and broadcasters, departing from Honolulu to the vicinity of the test site. The first press conference was held on board today, announcing that the first atomic bomb test will be purely experimental in nature, rather than a naval warfare test. Naval authorities last fall chose from three possible atomic bomb tests, none of which could include all tests. They are: (1) Purely experimental—measuring the bomb itself, detonating it at high altitude; (2) Harbor attack style—attacking on or below the water surface; (3) Attacking ship style—detonating from deep water. The first test is scheduled to be held on July 1st. The harbor attack test is scheduled to be held on July 20th, detonating in a shallow lake bottom mooring area. The pressure of the first test will be exerted on the front, back, left, and right of the ship and on all decks, etc. Ordinary bombs and torpedoes only exert pressure on one side and crush the side under pressure. Because it is purely experimental in nature, the ships will be arranged safely to determine which ships can be preserved and the limits and distances for the safety of ships and people.</p>
<p>High Heat Can Melt Copper and Iron</p>
<p>As for the impact of this bomb on jeeps, trucks, airplanes, and other military equipment, it cannot be determined until after the test. This equipment will be placed on the deck at carefully selected distances. The internal heat and blast of the bomb are approximately 100 million degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists will study the impact on copper plate turret shells, which may melt. There has never been such a huge and high-temperature furnace in the world for this kind of test.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The flagship USS McKinley, which is conducting the atomic bomb tests, telegraphed today that due to bad weather since the atomic bomb test fleet arrived at Bikini Atoll, the atomic bomb dropping exercise has been postponed to Monday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kwajalein Island, 22nd Associated Press] The atomic bomb test is scheduled to be held on the 24th. US Army Air Force personnel who will drop, photograph, and record this historic fourth atomic bomb completed their final practice yesterday. Colonel Brancha, commander of the Flying Attack Group, said that we are ready and can drop it today. We dropped the bomb by Shen Nuo within 500 yards of the test ship USS Nevada, but I dare say that you will see on the day of the test that the bomb will land much closer than the above distance.</p>
<p>Footage Will Be 60,000 Feet Long</p>
<p>The crew of the B-29 bomber No. 354, which will drop the fourth atomic bomb, said that on the day of the test, 14 tense and extremely confident aviators will carry out this flight of only 45 miles. US Army Air Force photographers are also ready and can immediately capture footage up to 60,000 feet in length. The length of film used for ordinary films is more than what is needed for ten full-length Hollywood films. A total of 180 movie cameras and 120 ordinary cameras will be used to record the entire process of the atomic bomb test.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Tehran, 22nd] Iranian Foreign Ministry officials declared today that the Soviet Union still controls ten miles east and west of Azerbaijan province, and the airport at Pahlavi, a Black Sea summer resort, opposes the landing of planes piloted by American airmen. A regularly scheduled Iranian Airlines flight to Pahlavi was therefore canceled yesterday. Iranian Airlines is an auxiliary company of the World Air Transport Association. An official of the Iranian State Railways also mentioned two days ago that the Soviet Union still controls the Azerbaijan railway. (Note: The Soviet Union announced last month that it had completely withdrawn from Azerbaijan). U.S. Military Attaché to Tehran, Lieutenant Colonel Zanserkes, returned today from Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan, reporting that he and three adjutants had been detained for eight hours by the democrats there. According to a U.S. Embassy spokesman, a protest has been lodged with the Iranian government. Among those detained with Lieutenant Colonel Sykes was Captain Archie Roosevelt, grandson of the late U.S. President Roosevelt. This flight to Tabriz had been approved by all Iranian authorities, including customs and public security personnel, so the reason for the detention is unknown. The U.S. Consul in Tabriz, Rosha, has returned to Tehran with the others.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] A government spokesman said that the Soviet Red Cross had invited Princess Polive, sister of the Iranian King, to visit eight major Soviet cities, including Moscow, Kiev, Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kharkov. Because the Soviet delegation has not yet arrived in Tabriz, the central government has not been able to receive the Tabriz-Jolfa railway near the Soviet border from the Soviet side.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. Army today requested funding from the House Appropriations Committee for next year's research work. According to Colonel Lee Ji, acting director of the Research and Development Division, we should anticipate that other countries will develop a long-range weapon that can cross the ocean, so the overall research plan must include countermeasures. In addition, the military is planning to study a missile that can be launched from the U.S. coast and hit ships hundreds of miles away. A detailed research plan was drawn up with the Radio Corporation of America last June and will be completed soon. The second step will be to study a missile that can not only hit targets hundreds of miles away moving towards the United States, but also flies so high and fast that it is practically impossible for ships to defend against it. This weapon can be called unparalleled in modern coastal defense weaponry.</p>
<p>Electric Control</p>
<p>The military has also contracted with General Electric to study long-range, ground-controlled launchers. These large rockets can travel at speeds exceeding five times the speed of sound (the speed of sound in air is about 1,100 feet per second) and can be controlled by complex mechanisms to ascend into the sky and land on targets thousands of miles away with pinpoint accuracy. The War Department had previously announced a molten metal jet weapon that could be used to counter atomic rockets or aircraft carrying atomic bombs.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 22nd] According to unconfirmed reports here, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, has gone to Alexandria with King Farouk of Egypt.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Cairo, 22nd] The Egyptian Group Party issued a statement today demanding that the Egyptian government grant Huseini full freedom so that he can serve Palestine. The statement said that the Mufti's resumption of political activities does not violate any laws, and any restrictions on his freedom would be inhumane and would weaken Egypt's position in the Arab world. At the same time, the Muslim Brotherhood also made the same request to King Farouk of Egypt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] A Foreign Office spokesman said today that the British government has instructed its ambassador to Egypt to negotiate with the Egyptian government regarding the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem remaining in Egyptian territory. Well-informed sources here believe that British Ambassador to Egypt, Campbell, has been instructed to inquire about the Egyptian government's intentions towards the Mufti and to state that Britain wants Egypt to guarantee that he will not engage in political activities, but it is not believed that Britain will request the extradition of the Mufti.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd] The newly organized four-member Palestine Arab High Committee has notified the Palestinian government of its establishment. It is said that the position of chairman of the committee will be reserved for the Mufti Huseini, the vice-chairman is the Mufti's brother, Jamal, the secretary-general is Kalidi, and the other two members are Hilmi and Goley. The Mufti was originally the chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, which was dissolved due to the Arab riots of 1936, and was reorganized and established in 1945.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Bishop Chen, the first Bishop of Shanxi Province in China, escaped the eyes of Japanese special agents during the Anti-Japanese War, secretly went to Shanghai, and flew to London to accept offerings. He recently held a special prayer service at St. Paul's Cathedral. It is unprecedented for a Chinese bishop to speak at St. Paul's Cathedral. The Archbishop of Canterbury will present the offerings from the 29 dioceses of England to Bishop Chen to "recognize the progress of the Chinese Church during the war" and as a symbol of "friendship between the peoples of China and England." Bishop Chen will go to York City next month to accept offerings from that district.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Unprecedented Major Meteor Shower to Appear This Autumn; Astronomers' Startling Prediction <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Cambridge, 22nd] If astronomers' predictions come true, on a morning in mid-October this year, countless meteors will appear, resulting in an unprecedented major meteor shower. The reason for the meteor shower appearing on a morning in mid-October is that the Earth will pass near a comet, reaching a point 135,000 miles from the path of the Giacobini-Zinner comet. The comet passed through this point only eight days earlier, and the Earth will approach the comet's path at this point. The largest meteor shower occurred in 1933, astonishing the world. After the news spread from Europe, it constituted the front-page news of various newspapers. In a few hours, more than 400 meteors appeared every second. Because the same comet has been rediscovered, this historically significant major meteor shower will appear. However, in 1933, the Earth passed about 500,000 miles from the comet's orbit, which is three times farther than predicted this time. At that time, the comet passed through that point 80 days earlier than the Earth, not eight days, so the meteor shower that will appear in 1946 will be larger than the Giacobini meteor shower of 1933.</p>

<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 23rd] Since this week, the International Military Tribunal has begun to take evidence on specific items. First, evidence was presented on war preparation matters such as "education, propaganda, assassination, and overthrowing the cabinet," and witnesses were summoned. Each witness proved that from 1931 to after the opening of the Pacific War, "military education was increasingly strengthened, and the propaganda department also carried out propaganda on the concept of a new order in East Asia and militaristic education." The defense also raised counter-questions, and the lawyer Kiyose actually said: "This propaganda was not intended to incite war against Britain and the United States, but was the inevitable result of domestic unity and the situation at that time."</p>

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department stated on the matter: the reason for the arrest was due to their violent behavior, trespassing on houses, and obstructing current business. More than 500 employees of Yomiuri Shimbun held another meeting yesterday and pointed out that the arrest was due to a conspiracy by the company. They resolved to submit protest letters to the president, prime minister, interior minister, and police chief, and submit petitions to the Socialist Party, Communist Party, Cooperative People's Party, and other anti-Yoshida cabinet members. After the meeting, they sent representatives to visit Minister of Justice Kimura and Interior Minister Omura, accusing the prosecution authorities of sophistry in claiming in the House of Representatives yesterday that they had not trampled on human rights, hoping that the authorities would deal with the situation properly.

<h3 id="e66">General Assembly of the Chamber of Commerce; Three Central Ministers Attended and Delivered Addresses; Hoping for a Sound Organization, Requiring Unity and Solidarity to Save the Industrial Crisis, Advocating Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 9th General Assembly of all members yesterday morning at the Chamber's address on Henan North Road. It was also the first General Assembly of all members since the victory. Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization of the Central Government, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, and Wang Yunwu, Minister of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai from Beijing to attend and deliver addresses. The city's leaders present included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the City Party Department, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 1,500 people from more than 200 units (various industry guilds), gathered together, a grand occasion unprecedented. The Presidium of the General Assembly consisted of Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jigang, Jin Runxiang, and Ge Jichen. The meeting opened at 9:30 am. After performing the formalities, the Presidium Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech, stating: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chamber painstakingly maintained itself in the concessions, and was then forced to move to Hong Kong. Later, it followed the government and moved to the wartime capital, always supporting the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country, and engaging in the work of resisting Japan and building the country. After the victory, it was very gratifying to be able to return to Shanghai. The reorganization work of the guilds has been roughly completed since the Chamber resumed operations in October. In the future, there will be many facilities. Qi everyone will work together to achieve success.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu Next, Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization of the Central Government, delivered a speech, saying: Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce, and has the role of leading the country's industry and commerce. The purpose of the Anti-Japanese War is to build the country. We want to build a modern country, which is to "industrialize." Everyone present has a very important mission for building the country. In this great era, the government and the people must work hard on both sides. The people must have sound social organizations, and the government must have perfect economic policies. After the victory, there are still many problems in front of us that need to be solved. There are places where the government's policies need to be revised, and the strength of society is still not enough to cooperate and respond. We must have sound policies and great social strength. The Shanghai business community is the leader of the national business community. Work together to organize a sound chamber of commerce. You can say whatever you want frankly. You can put forward any perfect and specific opinions for the government's reference. To make an industrial and commercial city prosperous, the first is "transportation." Chairman Jiang asked the Communist Party to restore transportation during the 15 days of the ceasefire. The restoration of transportation is closely related to nation-building. I hope the Communist Party will take into account the future of the country and the suffering of the people, and restore transportation as soon as possible. The second is "finance." We must adjust finance so that industry and commerce can benefit from it. The government should consider whether the current financial policy is conducive to the development of industry and commerce. In the trend of democracy, I hope everyone will speak as much as possible and put forward as many opinions as possible. Whoever violates democracy will fail. I am very willing to assist you in realizing your opinions. After Chen finished speaking, the audience applauded warmly.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang Then, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech. Gu first expressed his admiration for the Shanghai business community's efforts to move machines inland and assist in production at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and expressed his gratitude to the City Chamber of Commerce for moving from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Chongqing to assist in the Anti-Japanese War. Gu pointed out two major goals of nation-building: (1) political democratization and (2) economic industrialization, which are the established national policies of the central government. He also contributed two points to the Shanghai business community: (1) To improve the knowledge and technology of industry and commerce and improve the ethics of the business community, we must improve the organization of industry and commerce groups and recruit leading figures in various industries. (2) Consolidate international unity. This time, I was ordered by the central government to go to northern Jiangsu to help the victims. In Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taixian and other places, I saw tens of thousands of victims and devastated villages everywhere. The scene was very miserable. The Communist Party proposed the so-called "three assets" struggle. The so-called "three assets" refers to those who have "qualifications," own "assets," and are rich in "qualifications." All were killed or forced into exile. Therefore, there are many gentry and intellectual classes and industrial and commercial crises among the victims in northern Jiangsu. One is the lack of raw materials, and the rural areas are bankrupt. Where do the raw materials come from? Therefore, if political problems cannot be solved, economic problems are difficult to solve. Gu finally hoped that the business community would pay attention to political issues, support national policies, and overcome economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu delivered a speech. Yu put forward the four words "increase revenue and reduce expenditure" to solve economic problems. Increasing revenue means striving for production. The responsibility lies with both the government and the people. The government and the people work together. Speaking of reducing expenditure, the first is to promote frugality. The extravagance in Shanghai is even more prevalent than before the war. It is hoped that the Chamber of Commerce will lead various industry associations to promote frugality.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, pointing out the two major crises in the current business community: (1) the crisis of guarding, the domestic business community cannot compete with foreign business communities, (2) the internal crisis, the domestic business community cannot develop due to various problems, and hopes that the business community will cooperate with the government to overcome the difficulties. Then Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the City Party Department, and Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, successively delivered speeches. At around 11 o'clock, everyone took a group photo and passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Jiang. (Attached names) Finally, the Presidium Xu Jigang, Jin Runxiang, and Ge Jichen reported on the Chamber's affairs and adjourned the meeting. The meeting continued at 2 pm to discuss the articles of association and proposals, and elect directors and supervisors. Finally, a temporary motion was passed to organize a petition delegation to go to Beijing to petition the government, asking the government to adopt the suggestions of the General Assembly and build a memorial stone tablet to praise the Chamber's leadership of various guilds' loyalty to supporting the Anti-Japanese War, and more than ten other cases. The meeting was successfully closed at 7 pm.</p>
<p>List of Directors and Supervisors Directors: Luo Qinghua, Xu Xiaochu, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jichen, Wang Xianqing, Xu Jigang, Yu Zuoting, Hu Xiyuan, Qian Yongming, Wu Yunchu, Pan Shihao, Tu Kaizheng, Xu Xueyu, Shou Wei, Yang Bei, Zhu Shangyi, Zhang Wenkui, Liu Jingji, Hong Fuxiang, Shen Rixin, Ye Suochu, Cai Xintao, Huang Zhongming, Lu Yinggeng, Xu Ziwei, etc. 25 people.

<p>Telegram to Chairman To Respect</p>
<p>Jiang Junjian, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government: In recent years, the whole world has been in a state of fragmentation. Our country has been in the military for the longest time, and it is extremely difficult to support the decline and revive the waste. I am pleased to hear that Jun Zuo has used great wisdom and courage to stabilize the situation and permanently stabilize the country. From now on, economic construction will be on the right track. The chaos in China has been curbed, and global peace depends on it. At this time when the business community is gathering together, the masses are hoping for relief. I respectfully send a telegram to take the place of offering help, and I only hope for your approval. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce 9th General Assembly.</p>

<p>The Municipal News Journalist Delegation, which departed from Shanghai on the 6th of this month for an inspection tour of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways, was warmly welcomed along the way. The delegation originally intended to visit the "Liberated Areas" under Communist control, but upon reaching Xuzhou, the Communist forces had just captured Zaozhuang and were pressing on Lincheng, creating a tense situation, preventing the visit. In Zheng, the Guo translator shooting incident by Communist troops from Xiuwu occurred. The Zheng Pacification Commissioner's Office, fearing a deliberate attack by the Communists, could not guarantee the safety of the Shanghai journalists, so they did not inspect the front lines either. After completing their visit in Zheng, the entire journalist delegation left Zheng on the morning of the 22nd, and returned to Shanghai via Xuzhou and Bianjing (Kaifeng), arriving in port at 8:30 last night.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Typhoon to Strike Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Taibao News] Yesterday, Shanghai experienced strong winds all day, but the typhoon is actually expected to arrive near the city this afternoon, so the wind force today will definitely be stronger than yesterday. According to Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory, this typhoon originated near Taiwan. Yesterday afternoon, the typhoon center was located at 26 degrees North latitude and 121.5 degrees East longitude, moving North-Northwest at a speed of 15 miles per hour. It is expected to reach Shanghai or pass through its northern part around noon today. At that time, the wind force will be approximately 160 kilometers per hour, and the central area will be between 26 and 30 degrees North latitude and 126 and 130 degrees East longitude. According to reports, this typhoon turned north in the sea near Hengchun on the 21st and reached the northeast coast of Hualien Harbor on the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>According to the Meteorological Observatory's weather forecast: The Yellow Sea will be cloudy with haze, clear easterly winds, and moderate to locally extremely heavy sea waves. Central China will be cloudy, with localized rain and fog, moderate northerly to easterly winds. Shanghai will be cloudy and increasingly humid, with showers and storms, and strong southeasterly winds. The East China Sea, northern part, will be cloudy, with clear easterly winds and extremely heavy sea waves. The southern part and northern Taiwan, Ishigaki Island, will be cloudy with showers, cyclones, and turbulent sea waves. Temperature for the 23rd: highest 88.4 degrees, lowest 76.8 degrees.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bund Observatory hoisted the No. 8 typhoon warning signal black ball and lit the No. 4 red light at night to warn incoming and outgoing ships. It has been found that the maximum level of a typhoon is 12, while the central wind force of this typhoon has reached level 11, with an area of about 50 miles, making it the largest typhoon of the year so far. Judging from the development of the wind force, northern Taiwan has already suffered a serious attack, followed by Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Wind Force of 160 Kilometers per Hour</p>
<h3 id="e69">Passes Taipei, Heading Towards Fuzhou <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The typhoon passed through Yilan and Taipei last night, accompanied by thunderstorms, causing damage to electrical circuits that has not yet been repaired. Taipei is still under heavy cloud cover with drizzling rain. According to the Meteorological Bureau, the typhoon is progressing northwest at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour and is expected to make landfall near Fuzhou around noon today. The typhoon warning for Taiwan Province has been lifted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] According to a report from the Central Meteorological Bureau at 10:30 p.m. on the 23rd, a major typhoon is approaching China's southeast coast. At 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd, the center was in Fuzhou, and it is now moving northward at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour. If the speed and direction remain unchanged, it could reach Zhejiang Province by the morning of the 24th and will reach the Shanghai and Yangtze River areas. At that time, the speed may increase.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Life Behind Bars <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>A common criminal once asked a jailer with a questioning tone, "Why are those traitors living comfortably and carefree in prison, while I am stuck here, annoyed all day long?" The jailer's response was just a mysterious smile. To find the answer to this question, one only needs to look at the families of the traitors who gather daily at the gates of Shanghai Prison to deliver goods. Throughout the year, from food boxes filled with fish, meat, and delicacies to books, newspapers, chess sets, and other entertainment items, even shiny brass beds and brand-new canvas chairs, are delivered inside for them to enjoy comfortably. Under the enemy's iron heel, they certainly had to appear carefree. But what about the daily lives of ordinary prisoners? To find out, the reporter visited Mr. Tian Lixun, the warden of the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center. He graciously guided the reporter on a tour of the facility, allowing us to learn about:</p>
<p>Labor Viewed as an Entertainment Venue</p>
<p>When a person commits a crime and is detained in the detention center of the local court, the first feeling they experience is the narrowness of the "place." We usually call "prison" a "cage." This "cage" is usually seen as a metaphor, but in reality, their "cell" is indeed just a cage of about twenty square feet in size. To put it very pitifully, they are actually much smaller than the places where lions and tigers are caged in the Fuxing Park Zoo. In this small cage, five prisoners must be confined (according to regulations, it is four). They do not feel spacious even when they sit down. When it comes to sleeping at night, you can imagine what a crowded scene it must be. Therefore, every prisoner feels like they are in heaven when they can run a few laps in the yard. However, because the detention center is too small and the number of prisoners currently detained is as high as 2,187, the opportunity for them to take turns visiting "heaven" is only half an hour each in the morning and evening. They also have another form of entertainment, which is labor. "Noble" gentlemen and ladies may be surprised to hear this. But prisoners in the detention center do indeed regard labor as a form of entertainment. They all hope to escape the narrow prison cage and go to the spacious workplace to stretch their paralyzed bodies, revitalize their dejected spirits, temporarily leave the gnawing thoughts of prison life behind, and taste the pearls of life. But such opportunities are only one in four, because the workplace is small and the mobility of prisoners is high. Currently, there are only about 500 people engaged in light manual labor such as sewing, printing, boxing, bagging, woodworking, ironwork, laundry, and hairdressing. Due to the small scale, the surplus is not large. In April, it was only over ten thousand, and in May it was only over one million. According to Warden Tian's estimates, the surplus in June may reach four million yuan. Therefore, the prisoner workers also have a small amount of pocket money to take.</p>
<p>Prisoners from Foreign Countries Also Have it Better</p>
<p>As for their food, it is stipulated that there are two meals in the morning and evening. Each local prisoner receives 21 ounces of dry rice and 4 ounces of vegetables per meal, while foreign prisoners receive 14 ounces of bread and a bowl of beef and vegetable soup. Therefore, those prisoners who do not have family members sending them side dishes every day must sigh, "Prisoners from foreign countries also have it better." This may be a legacy of the concession era. Sick prisoners are given three meals a day of white rice porridge with pickles. Common illnesses can be cured in the infirmary within the facility. More serious illnesses also have nurses to care for them. The inside and outside of the prison cells are also very clean. Recently, DDT has been sprayed twice, and many white worms and fleas have been eliminated, so the threat of infectious diseases has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Warden Tian pays great attention to the education of prisoners. Every day, there are two types of education: collective and individual. The former lasts for one hour, while the latter is conducted at any time and is not fixed. But in order to enable them to "reflect on their mistakes behind closed doors" and avoid external stimulation, the focus is on indoctrination methods, and they are not allowed to read books and newspapers freely. No wonder the recently arrested grain official Ren Xingya exclaimed, "They won't even let me read the newspaper!"</p>
<p>From this comparison, the prisoner who sighed that he was "extremely distressed" was indeed not deliberately acting or moaning without illness, and it is inevitable that he would "regret not being ruthless and becoming a traitor in the first place." (Xingtian)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Crowds at the North Station Shout Against "People's Representatives" Going to Beijing. Stripped Naked and Painted, Protesting Internal Strife, Beaten and Humiliated. Bizarre Play Performed at Fuxing Park <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Ma Xulun and others, claiming to be representatives of the people of this city, planned to petition in Nanjing. Although various groups have declared their denial, Ma and his party of eight still went to the North Station at around 8 a.m. yesterday to take a train to Beijing. At that time, there were nearly ten thousand people gathered at the North Station. Some were there to see them off, shouting slogans against the civil war. Others were protesting against Ma and others for misappropriating their names, shouting slogans against political brokers Lin Handa and road politician Ma Xulun, "Beware of the Communist Party's conspiracy," "Down with youth peddlers," "Oppose impostor representatives," "Oppose internal strife," etc. They also wrote large character slogans. Ma Xulun and others, seeing the chaotic situation inside the station, went into the carriage immediately after arriving at the station and did not go out again. The train departed at 11 a.m. At that time, a group of people set off from the North Station and marched. When passing near the Great World, suddenly dozens of students scattered flyers from the upper floors with slogans like "Unite the Nation, Strive for Unified Peace" and "Resolutely Demand the Government to Suppress Internal Strife." The marching crowd then gathered over a hundred workers with wooden sticks and bamboo poles and went to places like the YMCA, dragging out four students, including Yu Zhenhua and Zhang Yong, beating and humiliating them. They stripped the four students of their clothes, painted the words "Special Agent" on their backs with black paint, tied the students' hands, and forced them into the marching column to Fuxing Park for a "public trial." Fortunately, the police learned of this and rescued the students.</p>

<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Student Anti-Civil War Alliance solemnly declared his position: (1) The alliance absolutely supports the government's national policy and advocates condemning rebellion. (2) The alliance has never advocated strikes or sending representatives to Beijing to petition, because the alliance believes that striving for peace depends on the united unity of the national people to appeal to the Communist Party to stop the internal struggle with a stable attitude, and it cannot be achieved by rash or reckless actions. (3) The alliance especially hopes that citizens will collectively condemn unscrupulous elements who falsely represent public opinion, publish statements, undermine KMT-CPC unity, weaken the government's prestige, and alienate allied countries, in order to correct public opinion.</p>
<p>Message to Students from the Student Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Union, in order to call for the protection of the glorious tradition of student movements, issued a message to students throughout the city yesterday, stating: "Thugs, under the guise of public opinion, have launched ugly acts of kidnapping, treating pure students as 'special agents' and 'traitors,' openly beating and humiliating them, and even tying them up and parading them through the streets. What is the intention of this? Why should good students be treated as 'sacrifices' for 'opposing the civil war'? Why is 'opposing internal strife' considered an improper act? Such unreasonable actions can only be done by morally depraved scum. Students throughout the city should regard this unfortunate incident as an insult to the glorious tradition of student movements, and we should immediately rise up to correct it and prevent it from happening again."</p>

<p>Amidst the current housing shortage in this city, most citizens are unable to afford to rent houses with gold bars. Now that summer has arrived, many people live in small rooms in the city, which is not only unbearably hot but also detrimental to hygiene and affects people's health. According to reporter inquiries: In order to solve the suffering of the general public, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has formulated temporary measures for the construction of temporary sheds:</p>
<p>Temporary License</p>
<p>(1) These measures are specifically formulated for the purpose of adjusting citizens' housing, reducing the burden on citizens, and constructing temporary sheds in the urban area. (2) Those who need to build temporary sheds may apply to this bureau for a temporary license in accordance with these measures and construct temporary sheds outside the restricted construction areas after drawing a plan. (3) Within the former International Settlement and the former French Concession, and along asphalt roads (or important highways) within ten meters, and other areas that hinder fire prevention, hygiene, or urban appearance, temporary sheds shall not be built without approval.</p>
<p>Building Area</p>
<p>(4) For the construction of bamboo fence earthen wall bungalows, a vacant land of 2.5 meters or more must be left around the perimeter. The building area shall not exceed 70 square meters, the eaves shall not be higher than 2.5 meters above the ground, the roof frame must be constructed with solid wood or bamboo materials, and the roof must be covered with tiles or other fire-resistant materials. For the construction of mat sheds, a vacant land of 5 meters or more must be left around the perimeter. The building area shall not exceed 45 square meters.</p>

<p>In the grain loan bribery suspect case, District Prosecutor Wu Qihua will continue to open court for a second interrogation at the Seventh Investigation Office at 9:00 a.m. today in order to actively and strictly investigate the true evidence of the defendants and witnesses. Those summoned include grain officials Yang Xizhi and Wang Daren, as well as related grain loan merchants: (1) Xie Changtai Zhu Shilong, (2) Xin Chang Zhu Yongming, (3) Xie Daheng Feng Yongsheng, (4) Qian Changyu Yu Liangji, (5) Heng Taifeng Zhang Chao, (6) Tongyi Company Lu Linxun, (7) Tong Chengchuan Changyu, (8) Santai Company, (9) Huifeng Company, (10) Changjiang Company. At the same time, Wan Molin, the owner of Wanchang Rice Shop, and Xing Zhigang, the manager of Chengfeng Rice Shop, who had previously paid a cash guarantee of 10 million yuan, were also summoned, for a total of fourteen people.</p>
<p>Moreover, although it was previously reported that the council would have two "no" expressions on this matter, the reporter made a special trip to visit Mr. Xu Jiji, a member of the Municipal Provisional Council, to inquire about the council's attitude towards this case. He said that since the exposure of the grain bribery case, the council had once convened a temporary meeting requesting the authorities to take strict action on this case. However, the official council will be formally established at the beginning of July, and this council is temporary in nature and will be abolished soon. Due to the imminent end of its term and the urgency of the matter, it does not intend to make any further proposals.</p>
<p>The eaves shall not be higher than 2.5 meters above the ground, and the roof frame must be constructed with solid Mao bamboo.</p>
<p>No Selling Allowed</p>
<p>(5) Any private construction of temporary sheds that does not comply with the provisions of these measures will be ordered to be demolished and severely punished according to law once discovered. (6) Temporary sheds that have been approved for construction must be occupied by the owner himself and must not be privately transferred, sold, or used for business purposes. Otherwise, they will be immediately ordered to be demolished once verified. (7) The residential period for temporary sheds is one year, and they must be completely demolished upon expiration. However, if the construction is good and relatively safe, an application for a one-year extension may be submitted before the expiration date, but only once. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation.</p>

<p>The situation in Northern Jiangsu is unstable, and refugees are fleeing to various places, distributed in Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Hai'an, Zhenjiang, and other places. According to investigations, the number is over one million. They lack food and clothing and cannot return home. The tragic situation of their displacement is heartbreaking. Wu Zhihui, Niu Tiesheng, Leng Yuqiu, elders of Jiangsu Province, and Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Rong Desheng, local gentry of this city, were deeply concerned and responded to the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, initiating the organization of fundraising relief. Preparations are now complete.

<p>Recently, housing rental disputes have not subsided. It is reported that the main cause of the disputes is landlords forcing tenants to move out. The Wartime Housing Rental Law has been abolished, and according to the articles contained in the Civil Code: (1) If the tenant fails to pay rent for more than three months, (2) If the house must be renovated or repaired, or the owner wants to take it back for personal use, (3) If the tenant violates the lease agreement. Landlords can demand eviction if any of the above situations exist. However, the current housing shortage is severe. Although the landlord's request is legally based, the tenant has nowhere to move. As a result, lawsuits are becoming more and more common.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Reward of One Million for the Gold Brick Case: A Waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe Receives It; Chen Yuansheng's Ex-Wife Does Not Forget Old Feelings, Visits with Her Son, Says "Take Care" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] After the main culprit in the Central Bank's massive theft case, Chen Yuansheng, was arrested, he underwent a preliminary hearing once yesterday morning. His confession was very satisfactory, and after a slight interrogation, he was re-detained. The rumor that he would be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office this morning is not true, because it will take some time to obtain a confession, investigate the case, and investigate the situation. It is learned that the female singer named Bo Luoli, who first reported the crime and accompanied the police officers to Hangzhou, was the first to report the crime. However, after arriving in Hangzhou, Chen had already left and could not be located. Therefore, the breakthrough in this case was actually due to the report from Chen Miaogen, a waiter at the Xiyuan Cafe in Hangzhou. It was based on this clue that the situation after his departure from Hangzhou was obtained. According to Section Chief Zhou, the reward of one million yuan offered by the Central Bank will be given to Chen Miaogen. Chen Yuansheng's ex-wife, Ms. Ye Yuzhen, who had divorced Chen about three years ago, came to visit him yesterday morning with her son. She had a few words with him and then said "Take Care" before saying goodbye.</p>

<p>If we consider Shanghai as a stage, the "housing shortage" is a short play currently being performed. The "temporary shacks" mentioned here can be regarded as a small episode within that short play.</p>
<p>Recently, on vacant lots in Zhabei, Nanshi, Yangshupu, and Xujiahui, numerous small wooden houses and thatched huts have sprung up side by side. The residents of these shacks mostly claim to be refugees from northern Jiangsu who have fled to Shanghai. Without obtaining the consent of the landowners or the permission of the Public Works Bureau's construction department, they hastily erected shacks overnight or within a day. Initially, a few people started, and then, like a gust of wind, a crowd followed suit. Now, almost all vacant lots in the city can be found with shacks of varying sizes. Particularly noticeable are those along the Ferguson Road and Avenue Joffre intersection, all the way to the electric tram stop. This area is supposed to be a "super" residential area, surrounded by beautiful Western-style houses. Especially on the left is a huge, six-story, ship-shaped building. In contrast, it creates a very strong contrast, making people feel very unharmonious.</p>
<p>Originally, the land was vacant, and now that these self-proclaimed "refugees from northern Jiangsu" have come to build temporary shelters, it seems understandable. However, the situation is not that simple because it involves many other issues. First, the property rights of the landowners, this most "primitive" of human rights in law, have been clearly violated. Secondly, the construction of these shacks is invariably crude and makeshift. The materials used are nothing more than flammable reed mats, wooden planks, and bamboo blinds, densely packed together. The residents are also relatively mixed, causing concerns about fire and hygiene. The most dissatisfying thing is that there are hidden secrets within. It is said that many people with "special lower-class labor" status are also using the name of refugees to "invest" approximately 500,000 to 800,000 in the construction of these shacks. After completion, they charge over 1.2 million in transfer fees to others, making a huge profit in a single transaction. Shanghai is truly a complex city, where all kinds of bizarre things are happening.</p>
<p>Originally, the Public Works Bureau had already formulated a "Temporary Shack Construction Provisional Measures" in November of last year. Most of the shacks that have been built do not comply with these regulations. The Public Works Bureau has long considered demolishing those that have not been permitted, and the police have also received many complaints from landowners. Therefore, the two sides are currently discussing enforcement in the near future.</p>
<p>A reporter recently made a special trip to Ferguson Road to conduct a field observation. There are more than 20 shacks in this area, varying in height and size. The roofs are made of red tiles, gray tiles, reed mats, or thatched roofs. The walls are of two types: wooden planks or bamboo strips and mud. Inside, most are dirt floors, dark and damp, with dilapidated furniture, clearly the homes of poor people. Near the road, a fruit store has already opened. Several more orderly tiled wooden houses are locked, it's unknown if they're waiting for the right price to be assessed?</p>
<p>During the photography, from those   inside came a lot of people, who followed closely behind. They were worried about the demolition of their houses and looked at the reporter with pleading eyes, saying:</p>
<p>"Sir, please say some good words for us! We are refugees from northern Jiangsu, we have no other choice!"</p>
<p>Du Fu's poem says: "How to obtain tens of millions of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars of the world and make them happy." The poet's fervent emotion, even after thousands of years, can still arouse infinite resonance and sighing from those with a heart. However, besides objectively writing out the facts, what else can the reporter say? (Flying Goose)</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate has been receiving requests from convicts sentenced by the former Shanghai Security Command and whose sentences have not been completed, asking the Procuratorate to review their cases and conduct new investigations. All the prosecutors unanimously believe that whether these convicts can be re-investigated is a legal issue. Therefore, they cabled the higher authorities for instructions. The original text is as follows: "After the restoration, the supplementary regulations for handling criminal proceedings stipulate that cases in recovered areas that were judged or disposed of by courts or prosecutors of illegal organizations during the period of occupation, whose execution is incomplete, shall be re-investigated by the prosecutors of the court to which they are attached. However, for judgments made by illegal military judicial organs, in accordance with the current Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, cases that should be tried by ordinary courts, whose execution is incomplete, are not stipulated as to whether they should be re-investigated. Please clarify this point. Second, during the occupation of Shanghai, drug cases were all judged by the illegal Shanghai Security Command military tribunals. Now, drug offenders who are serving their sentences are requesting re-investigations. How should this office handle them? Should the post-war measures for eradicating opium and eliminating its consequences in the recovered areas be applied? Please clarify this point. As this involves legal ambiguities, we are jointly cabling you to request instructions."</p>

<h3 id="e89">Method for Issuing Graduation Certificates to Students of the Temporary University Preparatory Class; The Ministry of Education Formulates and Promulgates Principles in Accordance with the Instructions of the Chairman <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] At the National Education Restoration Conference held last year, in order to assist students of colleges and above in the recovered areas with their studies, selection principles were set, and the Ministry of Education approved the establishment of temporary university preparatory classes in various regions to enroll these students, providing them with preparatory courses. Subsequently, due to transportation difficulties in various places, the students were transferred to schools in the interior, and were unable to return to their original schools within a short period of time. These students were unable to immediately transfer to regular universities for studies. In consideration of the students' studies and in response to actual needs, the Ministry of Education specially ordered the various preparatory classes to add basic courses in accordance with the university curriculum, and formulated measures for handling the studies of students who had studied at colleges and above in the recovered areas, and measures for the final examination and distribution of students who had not completed their studies at the various temporary university preparatory classes. For students in the highest grade who passed the final examination after completing the preparatory courses, the Ministry of Education issued temporary university graduation certificates. However, some graduating students still wanted to study at regular colleges and universities in order to obtain regular school graduation certificates. These students had already completed their studies in the preparatory classes. If they re-enrolled, the capacity of the schools would be limited, preventing universal enrollment. Moreover, repeated learning would increase their financial burden and waste their time. In order to alleviate this factual difficulty, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly considered and researched ways to reduce the difficulties for schools and students. It is reported that the Ministry recently formulated methods for issuing graduation certificates to graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes in accordance with the principles instructed by the Chairman and ordered their implementation. The details of the methods are as follows: (1) The graduation qualifications of graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes shall be approved by the Ministry, and the Ministry shall issue temporary university graduation certificates. (2) The schools shall issue graduation certificates to the graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes. (3) Graduating students of the various temporary university preparatory classes who volunteer to participate in the graduation examination of national colleges and universities may independently identify a school and, three months before the graduation examination held by the school in the 36th year, submit an academic record form, together with a temporary university graduation certificate and two 2.5-inch half-length photos of themselves, directly to the school for application. After review by the school, they shall be notified of the subjects they should participate in the examination. (4) The examination subjects in the preceding article shall be the same as the graduation examination subjects of the relevant departments of the school. (5) Students who pass the examination shall have their names listed by the school, graduation certificates shall be prepared, and submitted to the Ministry for approval and printing, and the temporary university graduation certificates shall be submitted to the Ministry for cancellation. (6) This examination method shall be limited to one time in the summer of the 36th year.</p>

The school will recruit new students in Wuhan, Beiping, and other places in the autumn of this year, and is scheduled to start school in November.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu] North Sichuan is a culturally backward area of Sichuan Province. The area is now actively preparing to establish the North Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial College. According to Professor Li Jiwei, the person in charge of the college, it is planned to raise a fund of 200 million yuan. The North Sichuan Salt Affairs Department has already committed to raising 100 million yuan, and the nine counties of Santai, Suining, and Shehong have jointly committed to raising 70 million yuan. For the remaining 30 million yuan, they plan to find other ways to raise it. If the full amount is raised, the monthly interest can be as high as 12 million yuan, calculated at the lowest interest rate of 6% per month in Santai. Even if the newly set professor salaries are paid according to the Ministry of Education, the funds are still insufficient.

<h3 id="e99">Hong Kong Expeditionary Force Suffers Another Defeat: China United Defeats Star East Team 2-3; Two Consecutive Goals in the Second Half Lead to Victory; Zhang Banglun Makes Countless Saves, Deserving Credit for the Victory <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong Star East football team suffered a defeat to Qingbai last week, they suffered their second defeat yesterday, losing to the China United team by a score of 2-3. Star East led 2-1 in the first half, but failed to score in the second half, while China United scored two consecutive goals within ten minutes, reversing the defeat into victory. The game was quite tense, but the performance seemed less exciting at first, gradually improving later. China United goalkeeper Zhang Banglun made countless saves yesterday, stopping several certain goals. He was truly the hero of China United's victory yesterday. The order at the stadium yesterday did not improve despite the increased ticket prices. More than ten thousand fans still broke through the fences and climbed over the walls from all sides. Although the non-constitutional police tried their best to maintain order, the gaps were like a flood, impossible to stop, resulting in chaos and deep regret. It is said that only over sixteen hundred people purchased tickets to enter yesterday.</p>
<p>Each With Their Own Strengths</p>
<p>The China United lineup was only decided a few minutes before the game yesterday. It seemed to be a difficult birth. Qingbai needs to fight Star East again on Wednesday, so in order to maintain strength, Li Yichen and Gao Baozheng were both resting. Wu Qixiang was initially intended to be on the bench, but ultimately appeared due to the importance of the defense. Xin Fuzhen was ill, so Meng Yiliang remained in the center. Han Longhai returned to his old role as right midfielder, but because he has been a forward for a long time, his position often fluctuated between forward and defender. China United's eleven players remained consistent throughout, and the arrangement was appropriate, with each player fulfilling their duty. Star East switched the positions of Guo Yingqi and Zhang Jinhai, and Xu Jincheng was changed to left defender. Fei Chunhua and Jia Youliang found it difficult to move as a result. In terms of strength, both sides had their own strengths, but the difference in victory or defeat was that China United's defense was solid, and Star East repeatedly failed to attack. Although they controlled the overall situation in the first half, they only won by one goal, and were unable to counterattack in the second half, also due to China United's impregnable defense.</p>

<p>Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Guo Yingqi Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Repeatedly Fails to Attack</p>
<p>Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the game. China United had the wind at their backs, while Star East was against the wind. Feng Jingxiang attacked, but was intercepted by Meng Yiliang. Zhaorong passed to Shuoyou again, and Shuoyou shot from afar, testing the waters. The ball was fast and urgent, and Wu Qixiang rushed to save, blocking it into a corner kick, without any gain or loss. At nine minutes, Zhaorong made a comeback, and Shixin was on guard, but Star East still did not succeed. Not long after, "Iron Leg" spotted a gap in the left corner, and quickly passed to Li Yao, who crossed the enemy defense and knocked on the door. Zhu Zhaohang saved the shot, turning danger into safety. Afterwards, both sides fell into a melee. Although Star East controlled the ball, they could not find a way to score.</p>
<p>Star East Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Until the 23rd minute, Guo Yingqi launched an attack in the middle, passing to the forward. Zhaorong caught it perfectly, and kicked the ball into the net from the right corner. Banglun was unable to save it, and the goal was lost. Star East took the lead 1-0, breaking the record. The away team's momentum increased greatly. Deng Guangsen crossed from the baseline, and Zhaorong headed the ball, but Zhang Banglun took care of both sides, appearing very busy. China United counterattacked. Li Yao received assistance from Meng Yiliang, and advanced quickly on the left. Rongsheng met him, and the ball went into "Iron Leg's" feet, who dribbled it to the Star East goal, and lightly tapped it in. The ball went into the net, tying the score at 1-1. After that, the two sides engaged in close combat, and the conflict was fierce. Until one minute before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua missed a certain goal, and the audience was lamenting. The Star East forward was already in front of the goal. Zhaorong went deep alone, and shot hard from the 25-yard mark, but it was saved again. Star East ended the first half with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>After halftime, both teams discussed their secrets. Hou Rongsheng of Star East left the field due to the recurrence of an old injury, and Luo Weiquan came on as a substitute. On China United's side, although there were seventeen listed players, six of them were spectators, so the lineup did not change. After the kickoff, China United's five forwards advanced together. "Left Foot King" looked ahead and behind, and Feng Shengsheng cooperated to resist, expending a lot of energy. At seven minutes, Li Yao took a corner kick. Xu Jincheng marked Sun Jinshun, and Luo Weiquan marked Xu. Unexpectedly, Han Longhai suddenly appeared. Liu Songsheng thought the enemy general was opening fire, and rushed over. The front of the Star East goal fell into chaos. Youliang saw clearly, and lightly kicked the ball into the net, tying the score again at 2-2. At this time, China United's momentum was high, and they suddenly came and went in the away team's penalty area. Just two minutes later, Longhai passed to Youliang from afar, who passed it to the right corner. Xiao Fei arrived in time, lifted his foot, and the ball went into the net, making the score 3-2, with China United coming from behind. Star East worked together to counterattack, but the positions of Longhai and Yongfu were exchanged, failing to stop it. Li Zhaorong was like a horse off the reins, attacking several times, but all were saved by Banglun. At 32 minutes, Li Yao left the field, and Feng Jingxiang fouled again. The ball crossed over the crossbar. When Li Yao left the field for the second time, the time was almost up. The melee did not last long, and when the whistle sounded, both sides withdrew their troops. China United defeated Star East 3-2 with strength.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Anecdotes from Recreation Garden: A Few Wonderful Moments; People Jumped Over Walls Because They Couldn't Afford Tickets <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's game between Star East and China United was wonderful, but the audience's performance was even more spectacular. The audience rushed into the stadium like a charge, with thousands of horses galloping. Countless people climbed over the walls. They couldn't afford ten thousand yuan of tickets, but they had to watch the game. The result was, of course, "people jumped over walls in desperation." Only 1,600 tickets were sold yesterday, but there were 20,000 spectators, which is why.</p>
<p>The main reason for Star East's defeat yesterday was the immaturity of their goalkeeping technique. China United's victory should be attributed to goalkeeper Zhang Banglun. Little Zhang was the darling of yesterday's game. After the game, he wore his jersey, took a beauty (not an American) in a rickshaw, and paraded through the streets. A group of little boys followed behind, and some even shouted "Long live Zhang Banglun!" This shows how popular football heroes are.</p>
<p>Two little fans "fell from the sky," resulting in injuries. After the paramedics bandaged them, they sent them to the best seats to watch the game. The reporter asked them how their injuries were, and one of them replied, "As long as we can watch the game, this little injury doesn't matter."</p>
<p>Our compatriots are not only anxious to watch the game, but they are also "eager to return home." After the game, the audience scrambled to exit, resulting in chaos. Some rascals took the opportunity to "operate," groping young girls in the chaos. So all one could hear was the sound of "May you be killed a thousand times."</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to those who entered using the "flying eaves and walking walls" method, there were also those who rushed into the venue using the military so-called "breakthrough" method. Two locations 20 yards from the entrance were "broken through." Staff and police inside the venue held bamboo spears at the "breakers," barely holding their ground. (Shu Xun)</p>

<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>It has been almost ten years since I last saw Pang Xunqin. This time, I heard that he had flown back to Shanghai from Chongqing, which made me feel infinitely happy. Finally, we met.</p>
<p>Many people praise us Changshu people, saying that Changshu is a good place, with a developed culture, and that every dynasty produces great artists. For example, Huang Yifeng in the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Gengyan, Wu Mojing, and Jiang Nansha in the early Qing Dynasty, and Pang Xunqin, a modern Chinese painter, also holds a very important position.</p>
<p>In fact, when politics are stable and life is not a problem, Changshu, with its beautiful Lushan and beautiful Shangchao, coupled with the superiority of its cultural traditions, it is very possible to produce several excellent artists. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy has been rampant, the soldiers have been in chaos, the countryside has been plagued by famine and plunder, and after the victory, there are still turbulent phenomena everywhere. How can we talk about art?</p>
<p>As soon as Xunqin saw me, he first talked about this situation in his hometown, which made him feel deeply disappointed.</p>
<p>He went to Paris to study art very early, studying the emerging paintings of the 20th century. Whether in conception, coloring, or brushwork... he showed a fresh atmosphere. He has been back in China for more than fifteen years. Some time ago, he spent some effort to promote the new art movement. In the past ten years, for the sake of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has been running around, and has only been able to gain a little in the study of brush painting and decorative art of past dynasties. Originally, he should have gone to Dunhuang, the treasure house of ancient Buddhist art, to do research work, but he has not yet realized it. Not to mention research, he has recently been trying to find a more settled residence in Shanghai, but he has not been able to.</p>
<p>The Storm Society has a historical position in the Chinese Western painting movement. It was founded in the autumn of 1932, initiated by Xunqin. Ni Yide, Zhou Duo, Duan Pingyou, Yang Taiyang, Yang Qiuren, Zhang Xuan... all participated, all of whom were excellent painters at the time. They demanded the acquisition of new techniques and despised the vulgar and mediocre academic art. Looking at the course of the emerging art movement in China, this is a group with very valuable, although, at the time, they only yearned for the so-called forms of 20th-century painting, such as the violent Fauvism, the deformed Cubism, the nihilistic Dadaism, the bizarre Surrealism... Whether these can express China's new art is still a question, but, in the process of creating China's new art, it is indispensable.</p>
<p>When the Storm Society was founded, it had such a declaration:</p>
<p>"The air around us is too silent, and mediocrity and vulgarity surround us. Countless stupid movements of incompetent people, countless shallow shouts of shallow people.</p>
<p>"We abhor all old forms, old colors, and abhor all mediocre and low-level techniques. We want to use new techniques to express the spirit of the new era.</p>
<p>"Let us rise up! Use the passion of a hurricane, the iron-like rationality, to create our world of interlaced colors, lines, and shapes!"</p>
<p>In many of these words, we only feel a kind of revolutionary enthusiasm, and this enthusiasm is the yeast for creating Shen Guo's new art, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>What about Xunqin's paintings recently? I am very concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>Recently, a small frame of his "Line Drawing Figures" was purchased by a collector in London for one hundred and twenty-five pounds. This is his personal success, but it is also a clear proof of the increased international status of the Chinese art world.</p>
<p>What are his paintings like? I have already seen two figure paintings in the Shanghai Fine Arts Writers Association exhibition some time ago. He said that these were unintentional works. However, we feel that Xunqin has been working on the lines in traditional Chinese brush painting for the past ten years, making the lines themselves simple, exquisite, and beautiful. Then, he uses these lines to complete the realism that has always been neglected in Chinese painting. It can also be said that he expresses reality from the ancient, simple and elegant, and despises the freehand brushwork in literati ink play. It can be said that this is a beneficial construction for the future of Chinese painting development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to see all of his carefully crafted masterpieces. Moreover, Xunqin is a cautious writer. He believes that the relatively satisfactory results in recent years are too few.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Only Warmth <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Junping</p>
<p>I haven't been to Suzhou in ten years. Although I've wanted to take some time to play there recently, it's so close, yet so far. In the end, I haven't made it. I can't help but feel a little melancholy about this. Because Suzhou is not very strange to me. In addition to the scenic spots such as Tiger Hill, Mudu, and Lingyan, there is also a fascinating story that makes it hard for me to sleep. This story is not a romance, not a scarlet fantasy, but only a little warmth in the world that allows a wanderer to experience the preciousness of human feelings for the first time.</p>
<p>In the summer of ten years ago, I was hired as a teacher at Caoqiao Middle School on Gongyuan Road in Suzhou. I also regularly wrote for several newspapers in Shanghai. Although the total income was only eighty or ninety yuan, prices were very low at that time. Eighty or ninety yuan could buy at least ten dan of white rice. Moreover, everything in Suzhou was cheaper than in Shanghai, except for daily necessities. At that time, I only had to send one-third of my total income to my family in Zhejiang, and I could spend the remaining two-thirds as I pleased. Fifty or sixty yuan was enough to maintain a person's life. Although it wasn't rich, I didn't feel very embarrassed. After a long time, I became very familiar with my colleagues. Everyone asked me why I didn't bring my wife from Zhejiang? I said that I also wanted to bring her over. People who are used to family life are not very comfortable with living the life of a wanderer again. Moreover, the dormitory at the school was too small. In order to cultivate a good writing mood, I had to rent a house separately.</p>
<p>My colleague, Mr. Shi, led me to see several houses, but I wasn't very satisfied. In the end, I chose a house on Xiatang Road, Qimen Road, owned by someone named Xie. The house was along the river, with more than a dozen rooms up and down, and there was also a living room and a courtyard. At that time, it was stated that the left and right廂rooms and the living room on the upper floor would be rented to me, and the living room would be shared by everyone. The rent was only fifteen yuan per month. I paid such a low price and could live in three large rooms. I naturally felt very gratified. I didn't need to live in so many rooms by myself, but since I was preparing to bring my family to Suzhou, although these rooms were still a bit too much, it wouldn't hurt to let myself and my wife live more comfortably.</p>
<p>The landlord, Mr. Xie, was an old man of about sixty years old. It wouldn't be very appropriate to say old, because he looked like he was only about fifty years old. He had a wife, a concubine, and a daughter of about twenty years old. In addition, he also hired an old nanny and led a maid named Juanxiang. After I came into contact with these people in life, I immediately discovered that they were all very kind people, except for the landlord's concubine, because she was a very incompetent and also had a neurotic woman. In Shanghai language, she was a woman with some "thirteen o'clock" atmosphere. She went to the story-telling house every day, rain or shine, and talked about "Madam White Snake" or "Xue Rengui," pointing to the sky and drawing the earth. I immediately realized that their family was very normal, except that the neurotic woman mixed in seemed a bit abnormal.</p>
<p>Later, I became more familiar with them. I could actually participate in their conversations in the courtyard without any scruples. Although they asked the servants to send tea and water every day, wash clothes, and serve me with all their efforts, Mrs. Xie still cared about me and often asked me when my wife from Zhejiang could be brought over. Miss Xie often asked me to show her the articles pasted on the newspaper because I could write some articles, because she was a young girl with some literary atmosphere and was more sympathetic and respectful to literati. I had not received the warmth of a family since I was a child, and now I was actually enjoying the rare warmth in someone else's family. My mood at the time was indescribable.</p>
<p>Later, I finally brought my wife from Zhejiang. At that time, my wife was already seven months pregnant. I originally planned to bring her over after giving birth, but there was no better obstetrics and gynecology hospital in the countryside. As a result, I accompanied her to Suzhou. When my wife arrived in Suzhou, the Xie family was very happy. They specially bought a lot of vegetables for her, which Mrs. Xie cooked herself. That night, I drank too much wine and staggered up the stairs. I heard them still talking loudly around my wife.</p>
<p>Soon my wife was about to give birth. The hospital was at Tianci Village Boxi Hospital. At that time, I was in class at school. My wife was accompanied to the hospital by Mrs. Xie and her daughter. That year, the weather was particularly hot, and the thermometer was almost always around 100 degrees every day. The two of them accompanied my wife in a rickshaw to the hospital in the scorching sun. The child died soon after giving birth. Because it was my wife's first time giving birth, she was very sad about the dead child. Later, my wife told me that although they superficially advised my wife not to be too sad, they hid outside the room and secretly sobbed for the dead child!</p>
<p>Later, I finally left Suzhou with my wife. I only indirectly knew that Mr. Xie passed away not long after due to a stroke. Miss Xie from the Xie family also got married. The world is changing, and everything has changed, right? Although I am wandering outside, I am always thinking of them, because they are kind people that I rarely see in my life, and I have rarely experienced the only warmth in the world.</p>

<p>— Shangguan Shen</p>
<p>On a peaceful and sunny afternoon, I walked out of the door alone. I met him and led him to the park. We wandered on the soft lawn. He snuggled close to me, showing intimacy, while I, lost in thought, stared at the distant blue sky. I forgot him. As I walked out of the park gate and stepped onto the street, I glanced and saw him still silently following me. I stepped into a cafe, smoking cigarettes, one after another. Light smoke swirled before my eyes, misty and dreamlike, rich stimulation, stinging my nerves. I absentmindedly moved down money and left. The glass door closed gently behind me. I met him again, "Come with me," I smiled bitterly. He snuggled against me again. He followed me, closely following me.</p>
<p>He is my own shadow...</p>
<h3 id="e107">Talking About Education <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>I know nothing about education, but recently I have had some thoughts.</p>
<p>A friend's son was admitted to a certain junior high school this semester. At the beginning of the school year, it was difficult to pay off tuition, miscellaneous fees, hygiene fees, labor fees, lecture fees, and other various fees. Unexpectedly, not long after the start of the school year, the school sent a notice stating that students must wear Boy Scout uniforms to school every day according to the order of the Department of Education, otherwise they would not be allowed to attend school! The lion had no choice but to reluctantly order his son to drop out of school.</p>
<p>Causing young people to drop out of school halfway for a set of uniforms! I have seen it in the newspaper for a long time. We strongly support every student wearing the prescribed uniform, because it is not only neat and beautiful, but also avoids extravagance and frivolity. We also strongly support the Boy Scout education prescribed by the government. Boy Scout education is to make young people exercise their bodies and develop a spirit of labor service for people and the country. However, in this time of expensive things and widespread hunger, we cannot but take everything into consideration and weigh the pros and cons. We want to rescue education, we want to rescue illiteracy, so that kind of "order" may as well leave a little room for flexibility.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Gradually, the late spring chill passed, the weather warmed, and with Mr. Liao's relentless medical treatment, Xiaohong's foot improved day by day. However, as the doctor had said, the healing was very slow, tormenting Xiaohong until she was skin and bones. During Xiaohong's illness, Bao Ling took over all her duties entirely and constantly visited Xiaohong quietly. According to Bao Ling, it would be better to hire a foreign surgeon for treatment, but Mr. Liao absolutely refused. He stubbornly opposed foreign doctors and foreign medicine, even to the point of an irreconcilable "opposition"!</p>
<p>And so, Xiaohong tossed and turned on her sickbed day and night. She was grateful to Mr. Liao, but she also resented him! Though she had only lived for fifteen years, she was already tired of living! Especially whenever she heard the mistress scolding indirectly, she felt that living was truly superfluous! She feared facing the future days. She thought that only death was the only way to relieve the pain, yet she couldn't die! The night seemed longer for her, and she deeply felt that she would never see the dawn, that she would be forever trapped in the darkness. Besides Mr. Liao, she was also grateful to Bao Ling, and she pitied Bao Ling! She felt sorry for Bao Ling because she knew that Bao Ling was suffering just as she was, enduring the same torment! In this world, only the unfortunate sympathize with the unfortunate; so Bao Ling sympathized with her; she sympathized with Bao Ling! However, why didn't Liao Dong sympathize with her? Wasn't Liao Dong equally unfortunate? She couldn't understand! Therefore, she was grateful to Mr. Liao and grateful to Bao Ling. In addition to hating the mistress, her feelings for Liao Dong gradually faded, to the point of trying to forget him! She also missed her parents and resented them! Ever since she married into the family, it seemed as if her parents had abandoned her. Though they were so close, she couldn't go home to see them, nor did they come to see her. She often muttered to herself, "It's true: 'A married daughter is like water thrown away.' My parents are so heartless to not want me anymore!" It was true; she had been severed from her parents by the tailor's steward as if cutting clothes, cutting the ties of father-daughter love with a single snip! But was this truly what the tailor's steward willingly did? Who asked them to have daughters they couldn't support? So, while Xiaohong resented her parents, she still forgave them and missed them!</p>
<p>Amidst a jumble of complex and contradictory emotions, Xiaohong could only confusedly endure the passing of time, keeping her eyes tightly shut all day long, letting fate be the judge! What else could she do? Her surroundings were so dark. She couldn't find a lamp, so she couldn't see a shore where she could find redemption!</p>

<h3 id="e109">Rice Market Remained Unchanged Last Week; Black Market for Public Bonds Declared Over; Gold, Banknotes, and Hong Kong Dollars All Strong; Sugar and Rayon Soared <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city, after the authorities intensified adjustments, although it has not yet completely stabilized, the overall trend has stabilized. If efforts can be continued, both the symptoms and root cause can be addressed, it may not be difficult to overcome the lean season. However, just as one wave subsides, another rises. As soon as the rice market achieved tranquility, the stock market suddenly stirred up trouble. Due to the official decision to repay the principal and interest of public bonds at face value, the high price that the black market for public bonds had been wildly speculating for days plummeted. It dropped to as low as 300 yuan. Numerous Chinese and foreign brokerage firms collapsed one after another, and the Chinese and foreign stock markets were also adversely affected. A decision to temporarily suspend trading was reached on Saturday. Other commodities were mostly stable, except that sugar and rayon increased somewhat more significantly. The weekly developments are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Hemp: The opening price at the beginning of the week was 1,875,000 yuan, once retreating to 1,870,000 yuan, which was the lowest price of the week. It was stable on Tuesday. Afterwards, with the loosening of the money supply, buying interest gradually increased. By Friday, it repeatedly approached the 2,000,000 yuan mark. Although it slightly declined afterwards, it closed at 1,995,000 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. The closing price on Saturday was 1,930,000 yuan, an increase of 25,000 yuan compared to the end of last week.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies: The opening price of US dollars at the beginning of the week was 2,550 yuan, once retreating to 2,520 yuan, which was the lowest price of the week. It hovered around 2,600 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Friday, with demand exceeding supply, it rose to 2,700 yuan. In the afternoon, it further increased to 2,720 yuan, which was the highest price of the week. The closing price at the end of the week was 2,660 yuan. The lowest price for Hong Kong dollars was 460 yuan on Monday and Tuesday. On Friday, exchange dealers covered their short positions, raising the price to 515 yuan, with the highest price on Saturday at 530 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The opening price of the Unification C bonds at the beginning of the week was 3,050 yuan. Due to rumors that the Ministry of Finance would begin repaying the principal and interest in July, it retreated to 2,450 yuan. The selling pressure remained strong on Tuesday, and many securities firms were stranded. On Wednesday, short covering was frequent, and it rose again to 3,150 yuan. On Friday, with the authorities clearly announcing that repayment would be made at face value, morale was depressed and the price plummeted to 950 yuan. On Saturday, the lowest price reached 300 yuan. Although some short-covering transactions were made, reaching 700 to 800 yuan, the market had already collapsed. As a result, the industry decided to temporarily suspend trading.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: At the beginning of the week, affected by the sharp fall in Unification bonds, morale was weak, and short sellers took the opportunity to become active. All stocks were at low prices. The "Three Small" stocks showed a slight glimmer of hope, but the good times did not last long. On Friday, they were squeezed down by another 10%. On Saturday, further affected by the plunge in the bond market, quoted prices were chaotic, and there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: At the beginning of the week, all value stocks also declined, and buying interest surged, uniformly squeezing the shorts. On Wednesday, there was a slight rebound. After Friday, due to the decline in both value and growth stocks, morale collapsed, and there was a sharp decline across the board.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains: The rice market remained stable throughout last week under the control of the authorities, but the underlying situation still contained manipulation. Without thorough measures, it would be difficult to achieve smooth operation. The flour market was flat and weak at the beginning of the week. After Thursday, it suddenly rebounded, and trading was also suspended. Coarse grains also showed little fluctuation initially, with a predominantly weak trend. They only began to show strength after Friday.</p>
<p>Sugar: At the beginning of the week, with the support of out-of-town merchants and local traders, the market price rose. Later, due to rumors that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would sell at any time, morale weakened, but this did not materialize. Morale turned firm, and prices rose sharply again. On Thursday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation raised its selling price, and the market trend rose again. Friday and Saturday saw repeated peaks, which was also a recent matter of great interest.</p>
<p>Cash Yarn: In the past week, coarse yarn was strong while fine yarn was flat. Guangdong merchants were very active in purchasing branded yarns such as 20-count Special Double Horse, Special Golden Chicken, Special Dafa, and Red Man Clock. Tianjin merchants were also actively purchasing 20-count Water Moon, Fengnian, Standing Horse, and Sunlight yarns. The market trend was extremely strong. The highest price of the entire week was 2,060,000 yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix on Saturday, and the lowest was 900,000 yuan for 10-count Weaver Girl on Monday. In terms of count, the largest increases compared to the previous week were 80,000 to 140,000 yuan for 20-count Special Double Horse, Special Golden Chicken, Special Dafa, and Red Man, followed by 90,000 yuan for 32-count Blue Phoenix, 50,000 yuan for 16-count Guangming, 50,000 yuan for 10-count Weaver Girl, and 10,000 yuan for 42-count Achievement. The Textile Building Company opened bidding for 26 types of yarn on Wednesday, 28 types on Thursday, and 27 types on Friday, totaling 81 types.</p>
<p>Fabric Market: The situation within the week was extremely ordinary. The market inventory was ample, and there was little special demand from out-of-town merchants and door-to-door vendors. Only Peach Blossom, Lady Lin, and Damingfu silk had slightly more sales than the previous week, with increases of 2,000 yuan each. The remaining brands were mostly similar, but 16-pound coarse cloth such as Huadie actually fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Printed Cloth: The Textile Building Company had not made any purchases for the past three weeks. Other private yarn factories, because they made a good profit by buying cotton to spin yarn, Da Sheng, Da Cheng, Min Feng, Qing Yu, Su Lun, and Xin Yu factories all made purchases, with prices increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous week. In addition, both New York and American cotton futures and spot prices rose by more than 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Rayon: The market was flat and unchanged on Monday and Tuesday of last week. On Wednesday, it became strong again. On Thursday, the silver money industry was closed for holiday, and there was no market. On Friday, due to the increased asking prices from Chinese merchants and the lack of 20-count bright rayon, coupled with active buying by bullish traders, a situation of rampant price increases was created. On Saturday, there was no shortage of profit-taking sales, so prices fell slightly.</p>
<p>Factory By-products: The market was firm and stable. Foreign firms had little inventory. Actual sales to end-users were minimal. Transactions between fellow traders were still lively. At the beginning of the week, 78-point high-grade material was priced at 2,330,000 yuan. New orders for 76-77 point material were priced at 2,200,000 to 2,250,000 yuan. Within the week, mid-grade five-dan material was priced at 2,100,000 to 2,150,000 yuan, while other dan material was priced at 2,000,000 to 2,050,000 yuan. Ordinary other dan material was priced at 1,900,000 to 2,000,000 yuan. Five-dan dried material was priced at 1,550,000 to 1,650,000 yuan. All grades increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods: Meiya quilt covers were rarely traded within the week, with quoted prices generally ranging from 1,500,000 to 1,520,000 or 1,530,000 yuan. Although there were many transactions in Da Cheng Ge Shichou silk, selling prices gradually declined. On Monday, it was 5,570 yuan. On Tuesday, there was a slight increase, rising by 100 yuan. On Saturday, it weakened again, finally trading at 5,220 yuan. Hangzhou goods such as various spinning silks saw high increases. Sheng Huo electric spinning silk was actively purchased by out-of-town merchants, and prices rose sharply.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Ge Jingzhong Discusses: <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<h3 id="e118">Sericulture: One Load of Silk Requires a Loss of One Million; Cocoon Production Sufficient for Only Half a Year; Eastern Silkworm Cocoons of Good Quality and High Price <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Sericulture Company, told a Central News Agency reporter at his residence that this year's silkworm eggs are divided into two categories: domestically improved and Eastern varieties. The Eastern varieties are those imported by China Sericulture from Japan this year, and are the latest invention of Japan. The cocoon quality is excellent. While the price of average silkworm is sold for less than 100,000 yuan, the eastern ones can be sold for 150,000. If silkworm farmers only breed and nurture ordinary types, they will definitely lose money. Nurturning the Eastern type can cover costs, and also manufacturers are willing to pay high prices for them, because it can lower the costs of silk reeling, making it more cost effective than cheaper ones. Those outside are unaware of the reality and think that somebody is oppressing the farmers, or somebody is raising prices. All is not as it seems. This year the the China Sericulture Company is promoting the Eastern type by taking the latest and best types and producing in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yunnan, domestic types can improve. He then added that this year's silk market is facing steeply increasing rice prices, which causes the cost of drying silk to increase, and the costs of one load of silk cocoons is approximately 500,000 or more. As the cost of four loads of cocoons to make silk is approximately 2,000,000 yuan, and the cost of reeling the silk is approximately 1.2 million, based on the current price of silk, not including the burden of interest, there is a loss of approximately one million. He added that the government is promoting raw silk exports and increased production. Therefore, the national bank and China Sericulture company are working together and are aware of the losses, purely due to cost of living and the disparity in exchange ratios. In absolute support of the government, it has been decided to not let silk merchants walk on the road to destruction. Soon, there will be enlightening incentive policies so that both the silkworm farmers and silk merchants can tough out the hard times and the state can improve its exports. Regarding the ban of foreign silk imports to preserve the China Silk industry, Ge said that silk is important for the peasants and also the four provences of Jiang Zhe Chuan Yue, it is crucial for rural prosperity, it is not only about the exports. Ge thought that the solution to the crisis is that the silk production can produce 16 to 17 thousand loads in the Jiang Zhe province, but the cocoon price is too low, and some farmers only produce earth silk to await the better prices. Its quantity will be only 5 to 6 thousand loads, it is indeed a waste. Because the price of earth silk is lower than factory silk, Ge continued and said that the silk factories in Jiangzhe and Shanghai can manufacture 40 thousands loads of silk, but the cocoons can only last for 6 months. Therefore, they have asked the government to negotiate 70,000 loads of silk cocoons to Japan on loan. (Rumors of reparations are absolutely not true) If it can be done, the shortage of raw materials can be solved, and the exports of raw silk can gain 40-50 million USD.</p>

<p>[United Press, Singapore, 22nd] A British Air Force survey of harvests in Burma and Java found that the amount available for domestic needs was still short by more than 600,000 tons. However, the British Cabinet's Far East Commissioner, Sir Gilbert Rennie, announced that Burma would continue to export rice from its wartime reserves. Although there are no confirmed reports on the surplus rice in Java, the situation is expected to be the same as in Burma. According to a survey in Vietnam, the expected harvest is 3 million tons, with an estimated surplus of 104,000 tons available for export.</p>

<p>Hongjiang tung oil, of both the positive and negative grade had not been on the market for 7-8 years. Spring of this year, transportation returned and genuine western tung oil arrived in Shanghai. Counting Ji Ying Feng Da Chang Feng positive grade, Yang Heng Yuan, Xu Rong Chang, Xiao Heng Qing, Liu Qing Yuan Feng, Liu Tong Qing, Da You Feng, and Qing Yuan Feng brand of negative grades, the sales of the spring had passed, and the sales in the summer is not smooth due to the special situations in northern Yangtze. The sales place has almost disappeared, but the amount of tung oil has remained sizable. And the Hongjiang oil manufactured here has been sold for years, even if genuine tung oil comes, it cannot be completely removed, which also suppresses sales. Recently, Ji Ying Li's positive grade is selling at 90,000 yuan, Da Chang is 75,000 yuan, the prices of western negative grades are 62,000 yuan. The sales are not great and the market is weak.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Letter to the Editor: Another Estimate of Cotton Harvest; At Most 150 Jin Per Mu; Requires a Loss of Nearly 63,000 Yuan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Your newspaper's June 21st commercial news column, "Uneven Joy and Suffering for Yarn and Cotton, Products Even Harder to Sustain," provided a detailed account of the excessively high profits of yarn factories and the encroachment of foreign cotton on the market, with little interest in domestically produced cotton garments, which was quite timely. However, the section on "those in the cotton garment industry" seems to be a miscalculation.</p>
<p>Your newspaper stated that "Our country's cotton fields can yield three dan of seed cotton per mu, with each dan currently priced at 30,000 yuan, totaling approximately 90,000 yuan."</p>
<p>In reality, the average yield of cotton fields in our country is only one dan of seed cotton per mu. Receiving 150 jin is considered a bumper year, while a poor year yields only 30 to 40 jin. Therefore, the market price of seed cotton and rice in our country is often in a ratio of 3 to 2. That is, before the war, the price of one shi of rice was 10 yuan, while the price of one dan of seed cotton was 15 yuan. This is based on the production volume of cotton and rice and represents the natural cost. Currently, the price of one dan of seed cotton is 30,000 yuan, while the price of one shi of rice is 50,000 yuan. This means that the actual value of cotton has decreased by 60%. If this continues, how can cotton farmers survive? The current crisis of rural bankruptcy is severe, especially for cotton farmers. It is hoped that those with knowledge will provide assistance, which is desired. As for the cost per mu of cotton fields (based on current market prices), details are provided below.</p>
<p>Land rent: Four dou of rice, priced at 50,000 yuan per shi, is 22,500 yuan. Average bean cake, 1.5 cakes, priced at 10,000 yuan per cake, is 15,000 yuan. Cotton seeds, 14 jin, priced at 100 yuan per jin, is 1,400 yuan. Spring plowing (planting cotton), four labor days, priced at 5,000 yuan per day, is 20,000 yuan. Mid-season cultivation (thinning cotton), ten labor days, priced at 3,000 yuan per day, is 30,000 yuan. Autumn harvest (picking cotton) is 6,000 yuan. Also (pulling cotton stalks) is 5,000 yuan. In total, each mu requires 99,900 yuan. The harvest is an average of one dan of seed cotton, priced at 30,000 yuan (current market price). Cotton stalks and firewood, an average of two dan, are priced at 7,000 yuan, totaling 37,000 yuan in revenue per mu. The loss per mu of cotton field is 62,900 yuan.</p>
<p>The above estimates are based on essential calculations. The wages of agricultural workers have also increased significantly, exceeding approximately double the pre-war level (pre-war, each labor day was equivalent to approximately four to five sheng of rice, while now each labor day is equivalent to one dou of rice) due to the impact of the increased wages of factory workers.

<h3 id="e122">A Positive Mentality <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>When the environment is not favorable, those who operate businesses generally have a negative mentality, believing that there is no hope for the future. This mentality, whether among business operators or laborers, is harmful to the business itself.</p>
<p>In fact, any kind of difficulty can be overcome with effort. Many unfavorable situations can become a thing of the past after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>In the current situation, the general manufacturing industry is in a precarious state, fearing great difficulties in the future and unsure of how to cope. In reality, as long as they work diligently and put in extra effort, they can turn thorny situations into smooth ones after a certain period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Current State of China's Mechanical Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Qi</p>
<p>Some say: The reason for China's lack of strength is that its industry is undeveloped, an important factor. But the underdevelopment of industry is actually due to the decline of the mechanical industry, with no one paying attention to promoting it or investing in it. To this day, China's mechanical industry is still in a state of dire need. Isn't it? The American Ford Motor Company can manufacture a streamlined car in five minutes (which is a fact), but looking around China, there is a great lack of talent. In fact, how many cars, new or old, can be manufactured? Of course, not to mention other, larger, and more complex mechanical tools. Therefore, every year, the amount of machinery our country imports from the United States is staggeringly large.</p>
<p>The scope of the mechanical industry is quite extensive, ranging from small foundries and woodworking shops (for making molds) to large arsenals and shipyards. The size of the work also depends on the size of the factory, from small daily-use nails and screws to large items such as bicycles, automobiles, and heavy brakes, spinning machines and carding machines in textile mills, and artillery and machine guns for war. According to statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, there are currently no more than a thousand large and small mechanical factories in China (including medium and above-sized foundries and woodworking shops), and less than half of them can manufacture nails and screws. As a result, various other machines have to be purchased from the United States and other places. The total number of various sizes of machinery in China is about 200,000, far less than one-third of Japan's.</p>
<p>The biggest problem hindering China's mechanical industry is that the government has not provided incentives, and capitalists have not promoted it or invested in it as a result. This is the first point. The lack of talent and the low wages of mechanical workers is the second. The old and former mechanical engineers do not think about improvement and research, and the cost is always much higher than that of foreign countries. Therefore, most customers tend to purchase from foreign countries. More generally, mechanical factories lack business strategies, and most of them act independently and lack coordination. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the post-victory era, under the slogan of revitalizing industry on the road to China's construction, how to seek the development of China's mechanical industry is also an urgent matter. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I would like to offer three points, and I hope that domestic experts will not hesitate to give their valuable advice.</p>
<p>(1) In view of the current situation, the government should urgently promote and encourage capitalists to invest. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it is necessary to first have unified management of the existing mechanical factories in China, regardless of their size or nature. For example, the work of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Machinery Receival Group of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is extremely complicated. Several factories in Shanghai that were taken over from the enemy and puppets, such as the Huxi Aigong and other nine factories, often ended up in a chaotic situation. Moreover, just when a certain factory was said to have been completely reorganized, it was about to resume work or had been working for a long time, it was suddenly taken over by personnel sent by the Executive Yuan. Past events, up to the recent Shanghai machine repair engineering industry, are not as well-organized as under the enemy and puppets. Everything seems disorganized and without direction. And Shanghai's mechanical engineering is the most developed area in China. If Shanghai is in such a state now, what about other places?</p>
<p>(2) The training of talent should be accelerated urgently. There is a great lack of mechanical engineering talent in China. In many of the machinery factories taken over from the enemy and puppets this time, we simply do not have anyone who is qualified to take over the position. Therefore, even now, the Japanese technical personnel are still being used. According to a recent announcement by the Ministry of Education, it is planning to establish more engineering schools and accelerate the training of technical talent. But it must be understood that, conversely, there is an extreme shortage of teachers for this training, and attention should also be paid to student experimentation. But now, building a substandard student factory costs at least 50,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) The salaries of mechanical engineering talent and machinists should be increased, at least to the same level as civil servants. And there should also be some protection for their lives. For example, the salary of a factory director or engineer is still around 150,000 yuan, and it is common to be crushed into pulp by the machine if one is not careful. Who would be willing to work in mechanical engineering in this case?</p>
<p>According to very reliable sources, our country has requested Japan to compensate for our country's war losses with all of its domestic machinery, large and small, totaling more than 500,000 units. This is a very gratifying thing!</p>

<h3 id="e124">My Views on Revitalizing the Silk Industry <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Cong</p>
<p>Since the restoration, there have been many articles about the "silkworm" business in magazines and newspapers, which proves that the people of the country have turned their attention to the "silkworm" business! If we summarize these "silkworm" documents, in addition to a part that is reporting in nature, many are emphasizing that "silkworms" occupy a particularly important position in China's agriculture, industry, and commerce, and now is a great time to revitalize China's "silk" business. The authorities should encourage the "mulberry and silkworm" business, establish silk schools, and provide silk industry loans, and other such beneficial views. After reading, the author has two additional points to add for the consideration of people in this field and the authorities.</p>
<p>(1) Popularize Silk Education: To thoroughly improve "silkworm" education, nothing less than a full set of general mobilization will do. In addition to increasing the quantity of university silkworm education, the quality needs to be enriched, and we need to catch up with the world's standards at a fast pace. Middle school silkworm education should not only create more specialized schools, but also insert a large amount of "silkworm" teaching materials into the biology curriculum of ordinary middle schools to meet the needs of the national silkworm business. As for elementary schools, it is possible to instill common silkworm knowledge within the scope, which seems to be the most practical benefit for the majority of elementary school students who stay in rural areas.</p>
<p>(2) Solve the Mulberry Tree Problem: This problem is to solve the problem of obtaining mulberry fields and mulberry seedlings. If the existing cultivated land is moved to mulberry fields, it is of course cutting flesh to mend sores, abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, destroying the countryside, and weakening production, which is not a good method. We should open up new sources and make good use of barren land - the dikes and slopes of hills, beaches, inland rivers and ponds, the vicinity of rural residential houses, the four sides of cemeteries and tombs...etc. to make the best use of the land and avoid abandoning goods on the land. As for mulberry seedlings, we should naturally choose excellent varieties and supply them as much as possible. After a few years, we can have the prototype of a "Silkworm Kingdom".</p>
<p>In this national production and construction upsurge, the author ventures to provide the above two points to express his concern for production and construction, and hopes that knowledgeable people will give their advice!</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Future of Flat Knitting Hosiery Factories <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Since China has had a knitting industry, it has only been about thirty or forty years, but the beginning of hand-cranked flat knitting hosiery factories is still a recent thing.</p>
<p>The knitting industry includes all weaving industries. All woven clothing does not have warp threads, and is smooth and comfortable to wear. Sweatshirts and socks are all made in this way. Ordinary socks have the same number of stitches on the calf and ankle, that is to say, the thick and thin parts of the foot are the same size. However, when manufacturing, the sock mouth is loosened a bit to allow it to be stretched when worn. However, socks that are stretched hard are not perfect after all, especially women's long stockings, where the difference in size between the thigh and the ankle can be several times. For this reason, flat knitting hosiery factories have emerged.</p>
<p>Flat knitting stockings have different numbers of stitches in the thigh and ankle. Starting from the thigh, the size is reduced according to the thickness of the thigh, so they fit comfortably on the foot and are popular with women.</p>
<p>Before the war, the machines used to weave these stockings were American electric machines, which produced very quickly. Only the Defeng Knitting Factory in Shanghai had four machines. When the Pacific War broke out, production was suspended due to a lack of parts. Therefore, someone invented a hand-cranked flat knitting machine, which could make about half a dozen stockings per machine per day. Although the output was slow, the quality was similar to that of electric machines, but the elasticity was slightly worse. Therefore, in the past few years, because electric machines were suspended and there were no imported products on the market, hand-cranked flat knitting hosiery factories in Shanghai sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Although sea transportation is now open, American nylon stockings cost 70,000 yuan per pair, while self-woven stockings cost only 10,000 yuan per pair. Since stockings are a luxury item, the government prohibits imports, so hand-cranked stockings still have a market. There are currently about 30 flat knitting hosiery factories in Shanghai, but they are all small in scale. Most of them have one and a half machines. The larger scale is the Hefeng Knitting Factory, which has more than five machines and all the necessary auxiliary equipment such as spinning machines. The raw material, "silk," is made by the factory's silk factory department.</p>
<p>Hand-cranked flat knitting stockings are a luxury item in terms of output. However, in the face of foreign goods flooding the market, it is enough to recover leakage. It is also a transitional tool when electric machine factories cannot be established. (Ren Hengliang)</p>
<h3 id="e126">An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Sometimes, due to economic reasons, it is not possible to buy vacant land to build a factory building. In that case, there are several methods:</p>
<p>A. Rent Land to Build a House. Lease land from the landlord, stipulate a term, the annual rent, and the method after the expiration of the term.</p>
<p>B. Purchase Existing Factory Buildings. There are two situations here, one is with the land, and the other is also renting the land.</p>
<p>C. Rent a Factory Building. In this situation, the future equipment issues must be considered. Because after renting a factory building, it is necessary to renovate or remodel it. The contract often stipulates that after the expiration of the term, the tenant should restore the original state, then the equipment and renovations installed will have to be removed, which will inevitably become a loss and must be considered in advance.</p>
<p>B. Factory Building Style</p>
<p>The Purpose of a Factory Building: The purpose of a factory building is to shelter machines, equipment, raw materials in manufacturing, and finished products. A factory building must have the following conditions:</p>
<p>A. A good foundation for the equipment.</p>
<p>B. Manufacturing work can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>C. Good ventilation, dryness, and sufficient light, so that workers can work comfortably.</p>
<p>D. Sufficient space to store raw materials and finished products.</p>
<p>The above four points are the basic conditions of a factory building. In addition, the money spent is for decoration or protection of the building.</p>
<p>B. Factory Building Style</p>
<p>Factory buildings can be divided into three types. The first type is a single-story factory building, with the roof in a sawtooth shape. This type of roof is usually called a Saw-Tooth Roof.</p>
<p>The second type is one with glass sheds or roofs on top. On both sides of the large factory building, there are sometimes lower factory buildings.</p>
<p>The third type is a whole building.</p>
<p>Among the above three types of factory buildings, the first and second types are more convenient to build, especially suitable for temporary factory buildings. The third type of whole building must be strong. Walls, pillars, and floors must all be considered. However, there is also one place where the construction cost can be reduced, and that is the reduction in the number of roofs, because the whole building only needs a small number of roofs, unlike the first type of building, which needs a roof for each floor.</p>
<p>Ultimately, which type of factory building should be chosen depends on the following circumstances:</p>
<p>A. How much land is available to build which type of factory building?</p>
<p>B. Which type of factory building is needed for the goods being manufactured?</p>
<p>C. Which type of factory building can be built economically?</p>
<p>D. Which type of factory building is most suitable in terms of the time period (referring to renting land, etc.)?</p>
<p>Other Points to Consider in the Factory Building.</p>
<p>A. Machine Weight: In some factories, because the weight of the machines is very light, the construction of the factory building can be simpler. As long as it can accommodate workers and the necessary equipment and is not invaded by wind and rain, it is sufficient. However, in factories that require very heavy machines, the factory building must naturally be strong. In addition, factories that manufacture sophisticated items, such as clock factories, must not have any vibration. Vibration prevention is not simply a matter of firmness. Construction experts can find ways to solve this for manufacturers. Fortunately, before building a factory building, it is necessary to consult with an architect. At that time, it is necessary to tell them the needs of the factory so that the factory building they design can meet the needs of the factory.</p>
<p>B. Flooring: Many people have a bad feeling about concrete floors because they are very cold. This is because concrete can absorb the heat from people's feet. At the same time, a person's walking is related to habit. For example, a person who is accustomed to walking on dirt roads is prone to fatigue once he walks on modern streets. Similarly, a person who is accustomed to walking in the city will feel tired after walking for a while in the countryside.</p>
<p>At the same time, people who are accustomed to doing mental work have cold feet because most of the blood in their body goes to the brain.</p>
<p>Most modern buildings use concrete floors, but if economic resources permit or if it is practically necessary, flooring can still be installed on top of the concrete.</p>
<p>In ordinary factory buildings, where the machines are not very heavy, wooden floors are more suitable. In single-story factory buildings, concrete floors are commonly used.</p>
<p>C. Fire Prevention: Fire prevention is very important for a factory building.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, factory buildings can be divided into the following two types:</p>
<p>A. Slow-Burning: These are factory buildings with brick walls on the outside, wooden windows and doors that are quite large, and wooden floors. These factory buildings are easy to catch fire, but if the fire is extinguished immediately, they will not be completely destroyed. Of course, after a fire, the appearance will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>B. Fireproof: These are built with steel and concrete. All windows and doors are made of steel. External fires will not be affected. Mostly, the things inside the factory building catch fire.</p>
<p>In modern factory buildings, when building, the head of an enterprise naturally needs to consider carefully how much money should be spent to make the factory building fireproof, how much fire insurance should be purchased, and how much fire prevention equipment should be installed in the factory building, such as fire extinguishers. A factory building is the production site of an enterprise, and safety and durability must be considered.</p>
<p>D. Temperature and Ventilation: Maintaining the temperature in the factory is very important. Firstly, it is closely related to the work in progress, and secondly, it is related to the work efficiency of the workers. If there is cold weather and no furnace or concrete, the work efficiency of the two will immediately decrease. At the same time, the manufacture of many goods is very sensitive to temperature, and it cannot be hot and cold.</p>
<p>In addition, the air inside the factory building must circulate to keep the air fresh. If the air is not circulating, the work efficiency will definitely decrease, and the health of the workers must also be protected.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Shanghai has all sorts of bizarre contradictions. Let's talk about one of them first:</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is a housing shortage. Everyone is using the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau as a hypothetical enemy, clamoring and clamoring, clamoring until it is unsatisfactory, and clamoring even more if it is unsuccessful. From the Management Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, the Municipal Government, to the Executive Yuan Housing Allocation Committee, everyone is dizzy. The bone is still the same, and they bite each other until the fur falls off.</p>
<p>On the other hand, construction companies are empty, architects are sighing, and on the open space, a group of homeless people build some sheds to barely shelter from the wind and rain, but they are ordered to demolish them. Large numbers of police are dispatched at all costs.</p>
<p>What kind of world is this?</p>
<p>In the Subei area, the local area is uneasy, and the people are fleeing one after another, and the number of people who come to Shanghai is particularly large. It can be said that these people have exhausted their family property and are in a very difficult situation. It is already their last effort to barely scrape together some money to build one or two thatched huts. How can they withstand such a blow now?</p>
<p>We are clamoring about the housing shortage every day, and even turning to the idea of ​​active houses in the United States;</p>
<p>We are calling for relief for the Subei refugees every day;</p>
<p>This is something that cannot be explained.</p>
<p>Why let the open space remain empty? (If the landlord really builds a house, then that's another matter.) Why do the police have the right to demolish people's houses?</p>
<p>Wise municipal authorities, please answer these questions for us!</p>

<p>— Bian Shan</p>
<p>A place so dark you can't see anything.</p>
<p>One weekend, by chance, I came to this place.</p>
<p>If you have a lover, if you want to pour out your heart, and if you are still mindful of her shyness, you will definitely exclaim: What, there is such a good place!</p>
<p>Yes, this fake place is not bad - no, it's too good! The entire room is divided into 20 "rooms" (saying "rooms" is really just a thin partition). Only a dim light in the middle is distributed to each room. Dimness and darkness envelop each other, and music has no legs to run here. Yes, there is no good tune here, or it is simply suffocating. However, you definitely haven't felt these things. What you can feel is excitement. When the person you are holding on your arm is your lover with a very high temperature, your heart may burst out!</p>
<p>When you two sit down, when you order something simple in the tea room, the "waiter" will never rudely touch the door you have occupied again, until you are tired of having fun after a few hours and press the doorbell to tell him that you should end your transaction - the price of two cups of coffee.</p>
<p>In this small room, not a trace of impudent and greedy eyes can be shot in from the outside. If you have had the experience of coming here once, then you will be bolder and do whatever you want. The high tide of passionate indulgence and the impulse of environmental pressure will make you understand the intention of this space setting.</p>
<p>The price of drinks is exceptionally high. Coffee that only sells for 900 yuan a cup elsewhere sells for 1,500 yuan here. However, you don't feel that things are too expensive here because you are too excited. You will love this place as much as you love your lover. You will dream of coming again next time, and you may even instruct the "waiter" to reserve a seat for you at a certain time the next day.</p>
<p>Where is this café? You really want to know, right! Do you want me to tell you? However, I will definitely disappoint you here, because not only have I not yet been appointed as the café's publicity officer, but also, telling you is in vain. There are no extra seats to be found there every day, except for the few ordinary seats in the middle. However, if you are a smart person, you will definitely find such a good "place" yourself. In order to meet the needs of a considerable number of the city's four million people, there are such places everywhere!</p>

<h3 id="e129">Blue White Ambition: Intending to Independently Conquer Australia <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huai</p>
<p>Since defeating Xingdong, Blue White's momentum has surged, and the situation has greatly changed. It was previously said that Xingdong intended to pull Blue White players to Australia together, but negotiations have stalled for the time being due to difficulties. Blue White believes it is strong and capable, more than capable of defeating Xingdao (Singapore), and is unwilling to be dependent on others. Therefore, it only expressed "appreciation" for Xingdong's good intentions. Xingdong's biggest distress lies in its goalkeeper, the weakest point in the entire team, deeply feeling that it is more likely to fail than succeed, which greatly impacts the entire "fate." Therefore, it intends to find another suitable person. It is rumored that they had considered the Italian immigrant goalkeeper, Tair Ka, an Italian player who participated in the Olympic Games and is an expert in soccer. However, upon further reflection, it felt inappropriate to suddenly introduce an Italian into a Chinese soccer team, which seemed out of place, causing much dilemma. If they were to negotiate with Blue White again, Blue White, as the victor, would have high demands, making it practically very difficult. This trip to Australia will involve many strong teams, and if they fail to impress, they will inevitably lose money, making it inconvenient to venture across the ocean and risk everything. Furthermore, after the cooperation between Blue White and Xingdong fell through, seeing Xingdao's successful tour, Blue White also has the idea of independently embarking on an expedition to Australia. However, Blue White's biggest difficulty is the lack of substantial capital. At the same time, entering Australia requires a considerable deposit. Although defeating Xingdong boosted their morale, they are unsure if they can be absolutely confident after arriving in Australia, causing a great psychological conflict. But on the other hand, both teams actually have shortcomings. If each goes its own way, it will likely lead to mutual harm. Therefore, for the sake of a successful expedition, merging the two teams is more suitable. However, since both sides intend to act independently, even if the plan to go to Australia is realized, it is unlikely to achieve satisfactory results. From this, we can speculate that although Blue White has ambition, it is unknown whether the backstage boss can confidently support this venture, which is worth pondering.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Qingshan Temple <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>After wandering in Hong Kong for eight or nine years, experiencing all the hardships of life and enduring everything given by barbarians, there are two places I most like to linger: one is Repulse Bay near Stanley, and the other is Qingshan Temple outside Kowloon. The former is a place to enjoy modern urban civilization, while the latter is a cool place to wash away worries. Four years ago, I used to visit these two places several times a year, but I never had to spend any money myself (in fact, I had no money to spend), and I always went by private car. Let's leave Repulse Bay for now; there are many good things to say about Qingshan Temple.</p>
<p>I used to visit Qingshan with several people, and I was the accompanying guest in this group. We would first take a car to the United Ferry Pier in Central, and a ferry would carry us and the car to Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon. After landing, we would usually go to a curry restaurant on Nathan Road for a hearty meal, and then speed along the winding mountain road to Qingshan Pier. From there, we would take a small boat to Qingshan Town and walk up to Qingshan. There is a pine path to follow up Qingshan, and there are pavilions halfway up the mountain to rest. It is most interesting to walk slowly with the group until everyone is covered in fine sweat. Upon arriving, we would first rest in a large "shed" made of sunflower leaves and bamboo, where the welcoming monk would serve tea. A cool mountain breeze blows from all directions, and the "shed" is large and does not let in any sunlight, so it is impossible not to doze off after sitting for a long time. Every time I went there, I would sleep in the "shed" and then wander around a bit. Strictly speaking, there is no place to wander around; there are only a few temple halls with Buddhist statues no different from other temples. Occasionally, you might hear a bell ringing once or twice, and you might see monks performing midday services in the main hall. However, the courtyards are more numerous than those of Linggu Temple in Nanjing, and since it is nestled halfway up the mountain, the atmosphere is naturally different. Behind the temple is a shallow cave with a large fish bone, several feet long, which the monks call the "Neng Bone" (miraculous bone). There is also a small hall presided over by an old nun, where devout men and women seek fortune and divination. There is also a rock inscribed with the five large characters "The First Mountain Under Heaven," said to be written by Han Yu (Han Wengong). I have never verified this.</p>
<p>Looking out from the temple, it appears very majestic, and the origin of the mountain's name is quite intriguing. But I don't want to talk about that. The abbot is said to be quite influential among Cantonese monks, and the temple's property is quite abundant, but it is said that the abbot's nephew has spent a lot of it. The welcoming monk is a vulgar fellow, but he has learned a few phrases of "fortune-telling" and always says a couple of lines to the patrons, at most two lines. Believe it or not.</p>
<p>Visiting Qingshan Temple usually involves eating a vegetarian lunch ("zhai" in Cantonese). When people arrive at the "shed," the welcoming monk comes to arrange it. The "zhai" tastes very delicious, especially for those who are used to eating meat and occasionally have a vegetarian meal. There is also wine to drink, and having a slight buzz makes you appreciate the goodness of Qingshan Temple even more.</p>
<p>In a word, visiting Qingshan Temple can make people completely forget worldly worries because the environment is very secluded, without the phenomena of sycophancy and power struggles. But it cannot make you forget yourself.</p>
<p>I have long thought of going there to recuperate. I believe it is the most suitable place for recuperation in Hong Kong, but I do not have the financial resources to do so.</p>
<p>For more than four years, I have almost forgotten about it because no one in Hong Kong has had the freedom or convenience to go to Qingshan Temple in the past four years. Even now, people are still hesitant to go there. This great famous mountain and this great famous temple can only be enjoyed by woodcutters and shepherds. This is because of the transportation and the fact that public order has not been restored.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Mystery of Personality <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Dr. Raymond Cattell, a psychology professor at Duke University and an authority on personality issues, has recently successfully researched a new personality system—using simple numbers to represent a person's personality traits.</p>
<p>To easily understand Cattell's new system, let's assume that everyone in the world has a "personality number," like the number on an athlete's jersey. When you see "29111" on the back of that tall guy, you can immediately determine that "he is a person with brains, but that's about it."</p>
<p>Another fellow is "81354," indicating that his intelligence is very low, but his character is very good. If two girls walk by, one is "44981" and the other is "44129," you can know that the first one is suspicious and reclusive; the second one has a cheerful, sociable soul.</p>
<p>Of course, making these personality numbers public is impossible. However, it can help individuals choose careers and select suitable talent for public office.</p>
<p>Dr. Cattell said, "Perhaps one day, psychologists will be needed to measure the personality traits of political candidates."</p>
<p>Before arriving at this simple system, Cattell did a lot of meticulous preparatory work. He first selected all the words describing personality from the dictionary, about four thousand or more, and then gradually eliminated similar ones, finally reducing them to one hundred and seventy-one.</p>
<p>The second step was to test these one hundred and seventy-one personality traits on hundreds of people. From this, it could be seen which traits often occurred together, and they were reduced again.</p>
<p>After completing the final statistical analysis, Dr. Cattell completed twelve basic personality factors, from which the main characteristics of personality can be measured.</p>
<p>For example, if a person is bohemian, the following characteristics are most strongly expressed in their personality: joy, kindness, rich emotions, informality, and sociability.</p>
<p>Dr. Cattell represents each person's personality with a numerical equation. For example, if a person is "5w, 8g, 4f, 1p2c," it can be known that he is a person of good character, high intelligence, straightforward, but not very good at socializing.</p>
<p>"In fact, the ultimate nature of any problem is a personality problem," said Dr. Cattell. "Whether you are studying the causes of war, improving education, or the problem of unemployment, in the end, it is all related to personality."</p>

<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Li Zicui asks: My friend, Mr. Jia, knew Miss Yi in his early years. Both parties had deep feelings, but were separated for several years due to the war. Recently, they met again in Shanghai, and Yi told Jia that she had been betrothed to Bing three years ago by her aunt, who acted as her guardian and hired a matchmaker. However, they have not yet married, and Yi and Bing are fundamentally different in character and difficult to grow old together. Yi wants to cancel the engagement with Bing (and her aunt also agrees) and reunite with Jia. Fortunately, Jia has never married. 1. Will Jia be punished by law? 2. Can Yi automatically cancel the engagement with Bing? 3. Does Bing have the legal right to interfere with Jia and Yi? 4. Is the union of Jia and Yi in accordance with the law? 5. If Bing is lazy and pretends to ignore it, can Yi have the right to publish an automatic public announcement to make it valid? I would appreciate it if you could provide instructions on the above five questions.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] 1. No. 2. Yes, but only if she is of legal age (20 years old). 3. After the engagement is terminated, he has no right to interfere. 4. Both must be of legal age, or if they are not of legal age, they must have the consent of their legal representative to comply with the law. 5. Invalid. If the engagement was not made by the party themselves and they never agreed to it, then they may sue for termination after reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>(2) Zhao Yangxu asks: I was engaged to Miss Cha last year through a matchmaker, with her guardians, her aunt and uncle, acting as principals. After five months, the woman left without saying goodbye, and there has been no news for a year now. 1. Can I unilaterally terminate the engagement, and what kind of procedure is effective? 2. If the woman interferes when I remarry or get engaged after the termination, what legal method should I use to resolve it? 3. Before the termination, if I can find the woman or the original matchmaker and I ask to marry, but the other party is not sincere or deliberately cunning, and therefore inevitably leads to the termination, can I demand the return of the ornaments and engagement fees at the time of the engagement, and the loss of the termination fee, or be jointly responsible for it.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Liu Yaxia] 1. If the woman's whereabouts are unknown for more than a year, you can unilaterally sue for termination of the engagement based on this. 2. The woman cannot interfere. 3. If the marriage date is far away, the engagement can also be terminated according to the law. The non-defaulting party can request compensation from the defaulting party for the damages suffered as a result.</p>

Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and the enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens for public welfare has always been the best in the country. Your newspaper is advocating charitable acts and immediately collecting donations, which is commendable. In Yongyu's opinion, disaster relief is like putting out a fire, the sooner the better. Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Accumulating small efforts will surely achieve great results. I hope your newspaper will raise the call and widely promote it, which is a great convenience to the public. I am now sending 6,000 yuan in cash as a donation for the Hunan disaster from Yongyu and my father, Yunshan, my wife, Taishu, and my young children, Chunga, Chunrong, and Chunchong, 1,000 yuan each. I hope all sectors of society will actively donate and contribute to charitable acts. Respectfully, Ying Yongyu, to Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Hunan Disaster Donations: 92 employees of the First Factory of Datong Bookstore, 151,500 yuan; Kang Society of Jiaotong University, 50,000 yuan; Dunhoutang Shen, 50,000 yuan; Fan Fuliang and 20 others, 28,000 yuan; Rixin Porcelain Shop, 30,000 yuan; Xian Guangsheng, 10,000 yuan; Guo Qifang, 10,000 yuan; Ying Yongyu, 6,000 yuan. Total amount received above: 345,500 yuan.</p>
