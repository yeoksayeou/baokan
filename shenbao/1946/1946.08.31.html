<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕馬歇爾特使卅日下午二時半飛潯轉牯，國府參軍皮宗敢隨行。馬特使行前，於十時半接見俞大維，談半小時。馬特使六上廬山後，不擬久留，約二日後返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕五人小組會議政府方面代表吳秘書長鐵城及張部長厲生，卅日晨九時聯袂飛潯後，馬歇爾特使偕助理柯義上校，繼於午後二時半自京飛　。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅日電〕馬歇爾特使卅日下午七時六登牯嶺，度週末，馬夫人携鮮花往小天池歡迎，然後同返河西路四十號。據消息靈通人士稱：馬特使此次所提先談改組國府委員會，以打開僵局，無異爲和平商談前途投一試金石。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕馬歇爾特使卅日晚六上廬山，據接近馬使者談：馬使鑒於渠與司使共同主張組織五人會議，改組政府，以打開目前僵局之建議，已蒙雙方接受，甚表欣慰。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕吳鐵城，張厲生，吳忠信，洪蘭友，谷正鼎，張九如，卅日下午四時一刻由京抵牯，吳文官長曾親至日高峯迎接。</p>

<h3>吳張在嶺談話　五人商談定下周開始　盼雙方和諧完成任務</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺卅日電〕吳鐵城，張厲生，洪蘭友三氏，今日下午五時在牯嶺中路一一七號態式輝公館接見在牯記者團。據吳張兩氏談：（一）此次抵牯，係向主席請示有關國府委員會改組事宜。（二）商談改組國府委員會之五人會議或五人小組會議之名稱，現尚未定，此會之組織與任務，顯爲臨時約，單純的，決不談及其他問題。（三）報載國府委緘名額除國民黨應佔二十名外，其餘各黨各派及無黨無派之社會賢達各佔四名，並非政協決議，因各黨各派無法求得合理之分派，乃由無黨無派之社會賢達商請政府代爲主張，應有上列之配合。（四）將來會商之有無困難，現尚不知，但渠等決以坦白直率之態度，必誠必信之願望，竭力以赴，並希望雙方開誠協商，對改組國政委會一事，迅速完成。（五）此次改組國府委會，增加國府委員名額，即爲擴大政府基礎。（六）改組之國府委員會，將代替國防最高委員會，爲國防最高決策機關。（七）渠等甚望此一會議能於和諧甯靜之氣氛中，順利完成，以消弭國內糾紛，俾解除民衆痛苦。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅日電〕吳鐵城·張厲生兩氏，卅日在熊式輝公館聯合接見牯嶺記者，態度異常平和，國大籌委會秘書長洪蘭友亦在座。吳張宣布，下週內即將開始舉行之五人商談，乃一臨時性之單純組織。兩氏並謂：余等二人奉主席指派，任政府代表參加，另由中共代表二人及美方代表一人所組成之商談，其名稱爲五人會議抑爲五人小組會議或更另有其他稱呼，余等尚難武斷。五人商談主要任務，在求「八一四」文吿中六項方針之一之實現，’即擴大政府基礎是也。所謂擴大政府基礎，亦即奉行政協決議，改組國民政府委員會，以代替現行之國防最高委員會，而爲國家行政最高指導決策機關。兩氏繼又回溯政協閉幕以後，中共不如約如期推　候選國委之慘痛回憶，致擴大政府基礎一誤再誤。記者提問曰：此次商談改組國府委會，仍係以八。四。四。四爲藍本乎？兩氏答曰：過去因各黨派推　應出之人數候選國委難得其衡，乃由社會賢達代爲排解，社會賢達排解未成，又有請政府公正處置之議，並有人主張以八、四、四、四、爲分配標準、此次商談是否仍按「八、四、四·四」舊調重彈，應候公議。記者又問；此次五人商談，能吾在國大煎獲得協議？答：政府但願如此，並望雙方在友好和諧中能謀擴大政府基礎之實現，俾其他問題皆可迎刃而解。問：如有人以超出改組國府委員會範圍以外之問題提交五人商談，將如何處理？答：相信大家都會考慮議程之範圍。間：中共代表究係何人參加，答：尚未見其正式發表，或爲周恩來，董必武兩先生，亦未可知。問：何以改組國府委會祗與中共商談？答：過去擴大政府基礎不能實現，僅因中共一關不能通過，現係再來通過。張厲生氏並謂：余爲人老實坦白，允不擅談話技術，實不宜充任與中共商談之政府代表，惟有本主席所示，用政治方法解決國內紛爭之原則，勉爲其難。</p>

<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕周恩來於三十日下午七時半偕王炳南赴美使館訪司徒大使，並同進晚餐，旋談至九時半辭出。據共產黨代表團消息，周對司徒之表示，係根據報載吳文官長及彭部長談話對於五項要求之吾定，認爲在此非正式小組會議前，必須弄淸兩項前提，即共產黨仍堅持政府必須保證改組政府後能立即停戰，及政府必須撒回五項要求，談判始能繼續，並盼政府對此兩點能作正式答覆，如不能獲得解決，周表示前途仍極悲觀，且強調如不能辦到此先決條件，則不能談到改組政府。按際此和平談判微露一綫曙光之時，周氏此種偏激表示，實足爲夜航中之暗礁也</p>

<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕東北傳來消息，國軍已於昨日（廿九日）下午八時進入承德，第二區綏靖司令官即可入城，今日執行部官方對此消息，持緘默態度，鄭介民委員以執行部爲和平機關，不談戰事」爲辭，婉避記者所提問題，記者詢以政府致共方請停攻大同之備　錄，共方有無答覆，　答「沒有」記者追問刻國軍進入承德，是否即實施該備忘錄國軍將進攻承德等地之警告」，鄭答「我非指揮官」，渠僅稱執行部對承德執行小組，極爲關懷。聞該小組已隨共軍撇往承德以北百餘里之山中，其電台與執行部失去聯絡，已逾三四日，執行部擬派飛機前在探親彼等，並補充無綫電器材，惟不知小組所在地，飛機能否降羅，葉劍英已允電詢該處共軍，並於今日午後廿四小時內答覆執行部。共產黨方面今日對國軍進入承德消息，未加批評，僅謂未接電報。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平三十日電〕記者特走訪軍事當局，據負責方面答稱，共軍圍攻大同，已近一月，政府方面雖一再向共方代表提出抗議，而共軍奪取大同之企圖，迄未稍懈，國軍旣不能向大同增援，只有以圍魏救趙之法，進軍承德云。</p>

<h3>中美民用航空談判　正根據平等互惠精神進行　英法菲等國亦與我談商中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕交部某負責人稱：刻在此間進行之中美民用航空磋商，完全根據平等互惠精神進行。同時，目前與我進行此類交談者，尚有英·法·菲等國家、若干國家與我商談，且在美國之前，因之，外傳我將以航空主權與美交換剩餘物資之談，顯不確實。另據熟悉交通情形者談：我國爲便利各國飛機在我境內條落計，會依照國際慣例，在國內若干地點設有國際航空站，此當不專限於美機着陸之用。且根據外國航空器飛航國境統一辦法，任何國家飛機飛臨我國境，事先咸須獲得我允准，主權固仍操之在我，稍有國際常識者，當不難明瞭。至中美民航談判，現仍在「探討階段且爲一種例行之事，雙方曾談及互相允許對方若干航空公司得在所定之若干地點降落等問題，聞或將有三個美國航空公司之飛機，獲准在我境內降落。至陳納德將軍之組織曾吾在內，則不可知。根據談判，美或將助我建造並改進若干機塲設備，此事係純爲美機之安全計，蓋美國專航程客機，常較普通飛機爲重，惟機塲造成後，得以使用者，亦不專限於美國飛機，此點亦應特別指出。</p>

<h3>財部顧問楊格發表聲明論我國經濟建設</h3>
<p>必須裁减軍費始得集中資源和平與工作尤為人民所需要</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中央銀行秘書處昨日發表稱：財部美籍顧問楊格博土，日內乘海格司將軍號返美，並發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>本人擔任中國政府財政顧問，在華服務逾十七年，今因體力不支，不得不離棄返國，作長時期之休養，撫今追者，不勝依戀。</p>
<p>中國目前嚴重之困難，乃八年苦戰之結果，人所共知，吾人欲判斷月前情况，必需顧及八年戰爭與破壞，對財政經濟及精神方面之影響。在此八年之中，生產銳减，交通毀壞，公私機關橫遭摧殘，輪運損失，在百分之九十以上，鐵路運輸多被破壞，飢荒水災，為害至廣。</p>
<p>然自抗戰勝利以還，中國已有不少進步，進口貿易幾已全部恢復，出口貿易及僑匯，亦在日益增進，豐收之後，國內飢荒災害可以大部得救，工業生產，正在逐步增進，輪運損失，正在迅速補充，陸路運輸亦在漸次改進中。</p>
<p>在金融方面，則物價已較前趨穩，外匯及黃金價格，則維持穩定，已達相當有效程度。政府財政收支不敷之數，自本年春季以來，已漸次减少，歲入亦在增加中，發行速率已在减少，通貨膨脹雖未阻過，然其程度則遠較一般人想像為輕，比之第一次及此次大戰期間暨戰後各國之通貨膨脹，則中國通貨膨脹之情况，尚不得稱為惡劣。</p>
<p>然而嚴重之問題仍屬存在，目前首要問題，長期受苦之中國人民，需要和平及工作，與生活之機會，苟無和平，鮮有獲致休養生息與經濟進步之機會，不幸由於和平之未能來臨，中國於英勇抗日中所贏得之國際地位，亦將因此而不能迅速鞏固。</p>
<p>當前最基本之經濟及財政問題，厥為裁减軍費，目前數百萬不事生產之軍隊，正在消耗大部份之中國剩餘生產物齊，故中國經濟進步之關鍵，即在設法减少軍隊。必如是始得集中資源，用之於經濟建設，蓋中國並無充分之剩餘生產物資可以同時維持大量之軍隊，並從事經濟建設故也。</p>
<p>欲求中國經濟與財政之進步，則第一步必須力求財政之穩定，一切可延期之支出，儘量减少。收入方面，尚須恢復財源，在此過渡時期，中國幸有大批外幣資產存在國外及國內敵偽物資，此外，尚有聯總協助及國外借款等，以往九年中，累積而成之不均衡狀態，自不能遽然加以改正，但在此種特殊資源尚可隨時動用期間，務需力求經濟均衡之恢復。</p>
<p>本人得於戰前十年之中國經濟進步期間，參加中國政府工作，並將親身經歷中國之艱苦抗戰期間及戰後建設之初期，深覺十分榮幸，所有蔣主席，宋院長，孔祥熙博士，俞部長，貝總裁及其他各位，對於本人之關係，尤所銘感，謹祝中國人民及其諸領袖，咸能排難前進，完成建國之大業。</p>
<h3>丁超五等報告行總在閩工作</h3>
<p>林榮森貪污說係誤會</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕福建省參議會議長兼福建省善後救濟審議委員會主任委員丁超五，閩省建設廳廳長朱代杰，最近自榕抵滬，昨午聯合招待記者，報告行總在閩工作，要點有三：</p>
<p>（一）最近報載行總閩浙分署副署長林榮森貪污案，引起各方面之注意，查此案實出於誤會，林以工程師而從政，對終手續方面未盡妥善，致啟外人非議，嗣經詳細調查審覈後，誤會冰釋，今後該區善後工作，可順利進行。</p>
<p>（二）閩省在戰時破壞普大，榕（福州）廈公路為交通孔道，戰時奉命全路破壞，現正計劃搶修中，該路沿途經十縣。長三百分里。戰前由華僑捐資築成，破壞後淪為水田，現由聯總工程師計劃，以機械築路法重修，除機件器材之費用外，尚須款廿七億元强，今次來滬業與蔣署長商妥，已計劃開始興修，大約需時四月至六月，方可完工。</p>
<p>（三）閩省人民在戰時貢獻甚大，沿海區受損情形頗嚴重，現有一千二百萬人亟待救濟，以醫藥（該地鼠疫流行），農田水利之器材為最急切，此行除向蔣署長報告外，並商討擴大浙閩區之善救工作，丁朱二氏定明日晋京，日內即返閩。</p>

<h3>日戰犯酒井隆死刑呈主席最後裁定　石庭長稱俟核准即執行</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州卅日電〕日戰犯酒井隆，前於八月廿七日經國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭宣判死刑，本報駐蘇記者特於卅日午後二時許趨訪主審該案之庭長石美瑜少將，承石氏出示判決書正本，並告以該案判決死刑之法條，係根據巴黎非戰公約，華盛頓九國公約，海牙陸戰規例，日內瓦公約，陸海空軍刑法而定讞，現已齋呈蔣主席作最後裁走，一俟核准，即行執行，預計至多十天，此侵略中國之魔首必可伏法矣，石氏繼稱：軍事法庭將擴充組織，庭長官階以中將簡派，本人因蘇高院工作繁重，已提辭呈，惟當局一再挽留，或將蟬聯。石氏並鄭重告記者謂：酒井隆未審訊前，英國大使館曾數度要求讓予英當局以香港戰犯身份受英國法律制裁，惟本人以酒井隆侵華元兇之一，較在香港之罪行尤為重大，故未充讓渡，結果遂由英當局供給罪證，由我軍事法庭併案辦理，是以酒井隆實係一國際性之戰犯也。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國府改組與否决權</h3>
<p>這幾天，中國政局似乎又有了一綫和平的希望。商談國府改組的五人委員會即可組成，並且政府代表吳鐵城張厲生兩氏和馬帥昨天又先後飛赴廬山磋商去了。這一綫的希望，是否從此可以豁然開期，還是要看中共的誠意如何。</p>
<p>蔣主席在廬山發表了那具有歷史意味的文告以來，已經顯示中共雖依舊作風未改，而政府為愛護人民，仍然主張政治問題應以政治方式來解決，故談判的途徑未絕，和平的希望仍濃。於此，馬司兩使復不以高齡溽暑，往返於京牯之間，奔走斡旋，幾經商談，我們終於看見有關於改組國府委員會小組人選的決定。據報傳消息，此五人小組的任務，雖以討論國府委員會改組事宜為限，絕不牽涉軍事問題及行政院等其它問題，但多少能給國人以新的興奮，因為國府委員會如能改組就緒，則其他一切問題此後均可在此決策的會議機構裏「坐而論道，」從容決定，不必取決於戰場，終是一件可以慶幸的事。所惜共黨又稱此舉或為烟幕，可見他們依然未必有什麽誠意。</p>
<p>本來關終國府的改組，使它能够包羅國民黨以外的各黨各派人士，成為一個最高的決策機關，原是現政府一貫的期望。如今有此五人小租的決定，我們人民總希望對於國府的改組，不但能够獲致協議，並且能够早日實行。然而報載中共表示，此五人小組的成立，其議題應為（一）國府委員會名額之分配，及（二）關於三分一否決權之研討，誠不免令我們又感到惋惜。因為所謂否決權，原是國府委員會開會時關於議事的一種程序問題，應該是個不成問題的問題，祗要國府委員會成立以後，委員會本身即可决定，本不必記為一個嚴重的問題而被提出。然而這次所成立的五人小組，如外傳研討「否決權」果為主要課題之一，則當該項小組即將成立之際，我們願先略述我們的觀感。</p>
<p>第一，嚴格地說，所謂「否決權」這個名稱，其意義極為含混。在美國的憲法裏，因為受了三權鼎立及制衡學說的影響，立法機關國會所通過的法案，行政長官的大總統得予以「否决」（Veto）這纔表現了三權鼎立及均衡與抑制的精神。但總統所「否决」的法案，如經國會覆議時再通過，那時總統就不能再「否决。」所以關於「否决，」原是一種美國制度，其目的在對於政府的立法與行政兩部門有所調節。至於國會的議員本身，在議事時，並沒有所謂「否决，」而只有「表决」。議案的「表决」如不能得到法定人數，就不能通過成為法律；但這却不是「否决。」國府委員會是一個最高決策機關，這裏只有「表決」的問題，而沒有所謂「否決」的問題。如果講到「否決」，只有在立法院通過的議案，如有違背最高國策的時候，國府委員會得以「表決」來決定「否決」（Veto）或不「否決」的問題，國府委員會本身議事，嚴格地說，實在不應該有所謂「否決權」的問題。</p>
<p>第二，「否決權」之提出，旨在少數控制多數，實在違背民主政治的精神。現在會議上所提出的關於否決權的使用，實非「否決」權原來的本意，而是一種蓄意破壞的行為，此即等於所謂Sabotage。何以言之？多數應該尊重少數，而少數尤須服從多數，本是民主政治的精髓。此項「否決權」的使用，却使少數控制多數，使多數不能不遷就少數。假如一個會議的會員為三十人，有三分一以上的反對，就可「否決，」是即十一人的少數，可以「否決」十九人的多數。假如說這是民主，那我們將見以後各民主國家的選舉競爭，大可不必爭取多數黨的地位了吧！</p>
<p>第三，在聯合國安全理事會及國際重要會議，如此次的巴黎和會，原也有關於「否決權」的提出及使用。在巴黎和會蘇聯代表所提的三分一否決權，還有英國所提的折衷案來補救；在聯合國機構，亦是蘇聯代表斤斤於「否決權」的提出及使用。但聯合國機構及巴黎和會終究是國際的會議，此其性質與國府委員會之為一國最高決策機關，何能相提並論？徜若在一個國家的最高決策機關內，而有否決權的使用，則事事受到牽制，只要三分一的否決，什麽事都不能決定，不但國家大計必將耽誤，且在事實上，倘有此三分一否決權的認許，是直無異於嬰兒誕生以前即已瀕於死亡。如果希望國府的改組能够加强政府力量的話，那麽這種制度所獲的結果却適得其反。</p>
<p>我們的希望是國府如果改組，則改組後的國府委員會必須是一個具有權力的機關；我們應該從積極方面來充實國府委員會的權力，而不應該祇從消極方面着想，以「否決權」來牽制國府委員會的權力。中共如果一方面真有誠意參加政府，而另一方面却堅持三分一「再決櫂」的規定，我們真不知他們要玩的什麽花樣。為了民族，我們再籲請中共拋棄它的成見；使這個改組萬一成功後的國府委員會的權力，能不因三分一否決權的存在而遭到凍結。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>義和團與清談</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>義和團於清代光緒二十六年（一九〇〇年），在平津一帶，焚教堂，戕教士，毀鐵路電綫，殺德國公使克林德。端王載漪諸親貴利用之，以圍攻使館，致引起八國聯軍之役。辛丑和約，賠款鉅萬，國家元氣大傷，並因此引起俄軍之入駐東三省，其後因撤兵問題，又引起日俄戰爭，以至九一八，釀成偽滿成立，皆由於義和國事件。</p>
<p>現在共產軍隊，在山東，河北，河南，東北九省，拆鐵路，挖枕木，炸鐵橋，破壞工廠，復在蘇　邊界及河北決堤，造成空前水災，安平事件，又有美國軍人死傷若干名，最近更在山東山西各地驅逐壓迫教土，不一而足。少數黨派復附和之。俘戰一再延期，修路駐軍整編諸問題，久久不能解決。長此拖下去，必至發生長期內戰，甚而至於引起第三次世界大戰。</p>
<p>義和團之旗號為扶清滅洋，其所信仰為白蓮教；共產黨之旗號為「新民主」，其所信仰為馬克斯主義。一為殺盡一切洋人，一為聽命某國洋人，而排斥他國洋人，其結果則同為中國人民之痛苦。老弱轉乎溝壑，壯者散而之四方，如現在揚鎮京滬一帶蘇北難民，可以見之。</p>
<p>在晋代，有一班士大夫，崇信老莊，蔑棄禮教，終日以清談為事，不知有國家。在今日，有國共協商，有各黨派協商，自本年一月十日停戰令下，以至今日，協商復協商，談判再談判，半年多仍不能解決。在晋代清談時，佐以揮慶，在今日協商時，輔以飛機。其結果，則截至今日為先，商談與清談無異，同為空談，於國無補。歷史家言晋之亡國，由於清談，將來歷史家又或將言中華民國之危亡，由於商談！</p>
<p>實際上，義和團雖是妄舉暴動，然只限於少數親貴和愚民，在清廷有袁昶許景澄諸人之攻擊，在地方有東南各督之互保，是非劃若鴻溝。所以義和團事件，可以亡國而猶未至於亡國。今日之情勢則不然，中共在其佔領區內，厲行所謂土地政策，自發鈔票，自印郵票，儼然為一獨立國，毀路決堤，殺人破廠，乃政府仍與談判，社會未見正論，解放區與水火區，內戰與內亂，永遠分別不清，國家已無是非可言。似今日之嚴重情形，更甚於義和團時代。</p>
<p>晋代清談、雖有人稱之誤國，然考之歷史，所謂清談，不過何晏王衍諸人，養成頹廢氣氛，雖無補於國，而要亦無損於國，雖無益於民，而亦未見有害於民。今日之協商則不同，拖延一日，全國便有傷亡者千萬人，流離者千萬人，工廠鐵路破壞者無數，財產物資損失者無數。是則今日毫無誠意商談，其有害於國家民族，更甚於晋之清談。</p>
<p>現在，馬帥司徒大使發表聯合聲明，警告大家調處瀕於失敗，而十四日蔣生席發表告同胞書，仍謂民族前途始終光明遠大，任何阻力不能阻我復興。人民在惶惑，在悲觀，而政府仍相信可以「政治方式」解決糾紛。當然，我們小民很樂意的聽着，但是究竟要等到何時始能解決呢？我以為為政府計，最要緊的在澄清政治，提高效率，一切漢奸案貧污案件，必須重辦速辦，絕不可因循姑息，政治上果能做到真正清明廉德，則失去的人心就可漸漸收回。然後秉天下為公之心，行救民水火之政，召集國大，頒行憲法，其收效大，將如孟子所言「民歸之，如水之就下，沛然莫能禦之」了。勝利已近一年，謹以此點為政府貢獻。（卅五，八，卅，）</p>

<h3>安理會波瀾迭起　蘇聯提人建議　要求各國報告國外駐軍配置　外蒙申請入會已遭棄</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約成功湖廿九日電〕安全理事會今日開會時，蘇聯突作驚人建議，主張各聯合國應於兩星期內向安理會提出八月一日時該國駐於外國軍隊數量及地區之詳細報吿，但駐於前敵國領土內者除外。蘇代表葛羅米柯係於新會員入會問題之表決結束以後即行提出者，並不顧大會之議事規程，未先將提議以書面送達大會列入議程，而即直接起立宣讀、英代表亞歷山大爵士大爲震憤，激烈反對，主席波蘭代表朗琪亦認爲葛羅米柯不合會議規程，宣佈於正式列入議程前，不必加以討論。</p>
<p>葛羅米柯之建議，主張各聯合國應即於兩週內向安理會提出關於下列兩事之報吿：（一）該國駐於外國（前敵國除外）之軍隊數目及其分配情形，（二）各該區內海空軍基地之情形，及防區之範圍、葛羅米柯攻擊「戰事結束已久，而盟國軍隊仍在他國領土內駐紮，且並非爲作戰之需要者。」渠稱，世界輿論俱正以「不能掩飾之憂慮心情，注意此種軍隊之發展。」按蘇聯此項提議，當涉及英國在希臘與埃及之軍隊，以及美國在中國與冰島之軍隊。</p>

<h3>日糧荒嚴重　本報東京特派員廿八日專電</h3>
<p>如何解決糧荒，爲目前日本經濟問題的中心話題，生產的困難，及犯罪增加，都因食糧困難而起。據衆院食糧對策委員的調查：與食糧有關的犯罪佔全國檢舉案中百分之七六，因食糧困難，在若干生產事業部門，勞動力發生了減退的傾向。據每日新聞八月廿一日載稱：因食糧情形惡化，各紡織工廠勞動糾紛頻發，致生產力大爲減退。日本的糧食，在平時本不能自給自足，多仰給於台灣與朝鮮的輸入，自昭和八迄昭和十二年（一九三五）期間，每年自台灣及朝鮮輸入的一千二百八十三萬石，按六、六石等於一噸。自昭和十四年後，朝鮮發生旱災，且朝鮮及台灣本身，在中日戰爭以後，米的消費也大爲增加，向日本所輸出的數量，於昭和十八年激减爲六百萬。在太平洋戰爭以前，並自越南暹羅緬甸，輸入外米八百萬石或一千萬石，但太平洋戰爭後，日本船舶减少，外米的輸入幾吿斷絕，因之不得不仰給於東三省雜糧的輸入，但亦因船舶不足，及戰局不利的影響，逐漸减少，所以日本除了主要食糧米以外，不得不將麥類及薯類作爲主要食糧的對象，一面再增加早稻的消費。同時在另一方面，蛋的食料亦吿激减，所以自昭和十六年度起對於一般消費者，實行定量分配同時並限制用米造酒，在實行足穀分配當時，僅只二合三勺。昭和十七年以後，並滲人雜　，迄昭和　年七月，再將配給糧減少一成。現行的配給量，在東京僅只二合一勺。本年四五六月間，糧食問題最爲嚴重，幾無配給發下，幸經麥帥自美國輸入大批麵粉及罐頭等，發與日人，糧荒乃略見減輕；但在一九四七年間，日本是否仍受糧荒的威脅，現仍爲日本民衆最關心的問題。今年因氣溫較高，預料所產米量，較往年爲高，但人工施助仍感不足，並因颱風及洪水種種關係，故本年度（一九四七）所能產之米量，的爲五千五百萬石，此種數字仍與實際需要相差甚遠，並須　食雜糧。去年四月的日本全國人口調查爲七千四百萬人，如加入遺歸日人數字，則人口總數將達七千八百廿萬人，如每年產米六千八百廿萬石，則每人每年的配給量爲〇、九一石，每日配給量爲〇、〇〇二五石，（二合五勺，）似此配給量，仍較戰前之平均消費量每杜一、一石，減少百分之二十，且此種配給量並滲有馬鈴薯在內，所具有的熱量價値較小。在此種情形之下，如無外米輸入，日人食糧仍感不足，以目前此種飢餓配給的糧食視之，一般日人自不能保持一定的熱量。城市的住民從須下鄕購買食糧，致造成一種黑市，促進食糧價格的上漲。此不僅影響重要產品的生產，且食糧價格上漲，工資亦隨受波動，對於通貨膨脹不啻火上加油現在配給的分量僅不過佔食糧保有總額百分之三十。日本食糧的來源，百分之七十均依存於黑市，都市中一般民衆出賣傢具。衣服。及一切生活必需品，以掉換食糧，在農村中遂造成一種非正式的景氣現象，而農產品價格高過工業品；換言之，高過於日常物資的價格，此中原因，由於現行配給制度欠佳，且農民交納食米制度頗不公平所致。固然解決糧荒的唯一途徑，在擴張耕地面積，日本有大量適於耕種的土地，迄未開墾，但據學者幾點視察的意見：此土地全部改爲耕土地，需時六十五年，日本農業生產能力也未達到世界生產水準，並所需肥料甚多，每人一日勞力所得的收穫量，僅小麥一斗，（日斗）而美國農民於數分鐘間即可取得此數。是以解決日本糧荒的方法，除擴張耕地外，並須提高農業生產能力，但此等方法並非一件輕而易舉之事，在目前唯一的辦法，惟有依靠國外輸入，甚至家畜的飼料也不能達到自給自足的境地，亦惟有依靠輸入之一途。美國方面的意見，認爲世界糧荒即可渡過，日本可自國外轍入較多糧食，主張增加生絲的生產，以之輸出國外，交換糧食。麥師資源部生產組組長布瓦爾中校，曾於名古屋生絲業公會中發表演說，作如是主張。綜合以上所述，日本的糧食問題雖尙未根本解決，惟經美方的施與，並因本年豐收情勢，巳峻前緩和，早稻現已着手收割，據聞：在北產地山形縣之收穫量，較去年倍增。和田農相於廿一日衆院食糧措置法令委員會中言明，本年十一月新米登塲後，現行配給量將酌予增加。食糧營國聯合會曾要求將現行配給量增爲二合八勺，近日來黑市價格亦漸吿低落，所以一般的結論，認爲日人當可渡過目前糧食難關。</p>

<h3>攤販的「末日」夕陽無限好　只是近黃昏</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕今天是攤販最後的一日了，從明日起，原本在街頭路側隨處可見的美國貨攤販，將不再存在。上海的主婦們素來敏感，這次也並未例外，當她們一聽得市長說要決心取締撇販，便深恐今後再也買不到便宜的洋貨，爭光恐後趕着大批採購—土反而使攤販們的賣買呈放最後的異彩。</p>
<p>昨天一早，美國貨攤販最大集中地點之一的朱　保三路，九點一敲，人便漸漸多起來，短短的一段馬路，竟像一所露天的百貨商店，又像是鄉下人趕廟會。馬路兩側人行道上密密排着大小不等的活動玻璃貨櫃，大多還放着　陽的大傘。路上更擁擠，摩肩接踵的盡是買客。整個一條朱葆三路擁塞得水洩不通。</p>
<p>這裏的貨品也實在多，全放射着眩耀的光彩。軍用罐頭食品最多，玻璃貨次的，你若要買點吃的，有罐頭的蕃茄湯，牛肉淸湯，大罐的乳酪，小罐的咖啡精，橘子汁，葡萄汁。你若想買點日常應用的，那就更多了，從衣着，玻璃皮包，玻璃鈔票夾，玻璃香烟盒等等起，到軍用毛氈，皮鞋止，眞稱得起一聲應有蓋有。其中甚至還有一攤竟是賣呢羢的，他的資本諒來不少。</p>
<p>最受人歡迎的大槪得推罐頭和化妝品有個青年人曾一氣買了十五罐蕃茄湯，擺攤的回說「沒有了，全在這裏了。」化妝品也擁有最大的主顧，大多數愛美的太太們多多少少買一點。有一位帶着個大旅行包，滿滿裝的全是固靈玉牙膏，史瓜勃牙膏，香粉等等。一面她還在買着一打白色小瓶裝的旁氏白正霜。玻璃皮包的交易也還不錯，有一個紅女伶也特地趕上這兒來了。有幾個學生在買派克五十一型鋼筆，七萬一枝的價錢，也還算便宜。</p>
<p>全市美貨攤販市集，不祗朱葆三路一地，諒來其他六合路，天主堂街，河南路，天津路一帶，也會同樣地擁着一堆一堆的買客。但是，過了今天，這最後的一天，他們怎樣呢？有的攤販說：「我們改行了，道一點貨色賣完爲止。有的却還抱着僥倖的幻想說：「他們還在請求呢。」可是最大多數的已很明瞭這種最後的無可奈何的局勢，儘量的「脫貨求現。只要等着明天，市長取締攤販的決心，便要像柄大掃帚，掃淸這些傾售美國私貨妨礙交通的市集。</p>

<p>雙馬一百四十萬　廠商派貨之紅盤　核準六千數百件　紡建掛牌昨仍維持原盤　　〔本報訊〕千呼萬喚之民營紗廠集中平價派紗一事，於昨日傍晚做開紅盤計雙馬標準一百四十萬，其他牌子依品叛滅減，廠號及客帮向各紗廠申請，經由公會核準派售者，共達六千數百件之巨，廣帮吃胃，依然不弱，在盤子做開前，紗市場空氣，竟日在糢糊中，迨傍晚開出，未發生若何刺激，因昨日紡建亦值開紗，掛牌未動，而前者雙馬廠盤本已做至一百卅餘萬，雖黑市曾高至一百六七十萬，業中有識者多預料此次平價，不致超過一百四十萬也，盤子之做開，係於紡建經濟部特派員辦事處民營紗廠代表合組之委員會協議下決定，措置尚屬周密，惟貨係期貨，包裝又係四百磅新裝，實用廠家及實銷客戶，終覺意有未滿耳，昨有若干紗廠，提前截止收單，則可見紗廠對此，要不無犧牲，紡建負責人吳味經表示決喚起同情，并希望受派之廠號及客帮，能予以合作，并稱派貨數量決不勉強限止，而交貨之遲早，則須視各廠實際情形云，言外之音，仍有「機動」骨子，據觀察家稱：如期貨之定期派貨未得具體辦法，第二批派貨時，申請者當見減少，而向紡建開貨者，仍不免擁擠云。其他各廠如崇信之大發，統益之金雞，聞均定為一百四十萬，與雙馬同，至申新一廠之紅人鐘，為一百三十六萬，二廠之天女散花為一百三十四萬，六廠之雙喜為一百三十二萬，均由各廠號及客帮申請，今日當可照此開派。臨收形勢突轉　華股均現高價　　華股上場卻遭出熱進冷套賣所壓迫，銀根未鬆，自高而低，高價時獲利者了結，人心不易樂觀，中途各股者呈低價，永紗見六四三元，美亞三六五〇元，景福二二五元，新光二五五元，勤興一七〇元，無如冷股堅定異常，於是雜行游資吸收小型股，首先加油，熱門大股低後呈盤，臨收時十分鐘內，突起買風，大戶爭先扖轉，近午反現高價，永紗達六七三元，美亞四〇五〇元，景福二五三元，新光二八五元，勤興二〇五元，結果較前收計永紗微升，美亞景福勤興各升半成以上，新光漲一成，較冷各中小型股微升半成左右，元老股亦稍上進。　　外股除曾德豐仍受殷實大戶吸納，祥泰木行亦繼續遭受爭購，兩者見秀，餘者略受銀根逼迫，稍受阻遏，而告微回，怡紗自九三〇〇元退至八七〇〇元，英聯自一〇〇〇〇元退至九七〇〇元，但結果仍升至一〇二〇〇元，臨收大事盤旋，結果較前收計怡紗英聯鋼業亞洲均告微挫，怡啤業廣平平，曾德豐紙業微升，祥泰木行哄高一萬三成交。金鈔平庸　　烚赤昨欲漲乏勁，逢高壓力頻仍，晨開二〇七萬，開後雖尚穩定，央行隨市供售自二〇八萬起，逐步盤小，十時後央行以二〇六萬之價，配售一四二條，低價曾降至二〇五萬，始稍見定，午刻在二〇六萬左右盤旋、午後續告微升，結果較前收微挫少許，對美鈔比價軋攏至六一八元對十兩，銀樓飾金掛低至念一萬九，紋銀平，銀元略低，喑拆仍因紡建開出大批棉紗，銀根見緊，息價自一角三至一角半不等。　　外幣平庸而盤，美鈔晨開三三五〇元有供，後隨金市同跌，低至三三一〇元，始告平和，入後套買稍起，午刻微升至三三三〇元左右掙扎，午後續有套買，略告上升，結果較前收無甚變化，港票平疲，申電升至一四〇元，七一〇元內成交甚多，結果較前收跌落十元，港匯七一〇元及七一五元，頗有成交，印匯八七〇元有售，英匯一一五〇〇元有供，美匯仍站牌價。　　檯面帮活動下　債市高後轉盤　　公債純由檯面帮活動，高後多盤，統丙晨開二七〇〇元，多頭欲出先進，高價哄抬至二八五〇元，於是前日大買戶五樓某號獲利斬售，中途回小至二二三〇元，最後又回升至二四五〇元掙扎，結果較前收計甲乙回小一五〇元，丙種跌二〇〇元，丁種小一〇〇元，戊降二五〇元，成交達票面五百餘萬元。歐美考察團　十月初可成行　　〔本報訊〕本市市商會所主辦之歐美商業考察團，組織將竣，現已派定各業所推舉之正式團員，十月初，可由飛機起程，團長以商會常務理事葛傑臣氏之呼聲為最高。遠期外匯利息　　中央銀行并不變更　　近來指定銀行遠期外匯利息，與中央銀行規定稍有出入，茲查中央銀行紐約遠期外匯利息仍為三分，每月照加百元，即電匯匯率三三五〇元，一月後為三四五〇元，二月後為三五五〇元，三月後為三六五〇元，英鎊遠期月加四百元。雙馬黑市不動　中小型紗續跌　　昨日紗市銷淡價疲，晨初同行均忙於紗廠開紗登記事，買賣無形中減遜，雙馬仍屹立一百六十萬關外，然中小型紗續搊軟化，約跌一二萬之譜，細紗并無上落，人心似在觀望，靜待紗廠首次派售情形之發展也，大生紗廠昨開出廿支特紅魁一百卅五萬，廿支紅魁一百卅萬，廿支彩魁一百廿三萬，凡老交易之客戶，每家配售二件，又訊紡建昨日上午十時掛牌開紗，價仍照舊，并無增減。　　閩蜀漢等處，對於嗶嘰，收羅殷切，因之情況帶緊，據市場上云，上日紡建配給之貨不旺藍V細布獨配染廠，同業未獲，現貨根子帶俏。食糖不斷上升　　昨糖市漲風依然未熄，實以現貨稀缺而環境使然，終非空言所能制止，如中砂白又升二三千元，其他土糖亦拾級而登，汕帮提青為十三萬五千五百元至五千元，沖提青十三萬二千元，成交三百包之譜，棉赤高十五萬三四千元，普通十四萬四五千元，刁青開過十三萬元，後叫十三萬二千元，興化白十七萬三四千元，興赤十四萬二千元。煤斤供應無問題　困難在南運交通受阻礙　　〔本報訊〕記者為明瞭近來本市煤斤供銷情形起見，特趨訪燃料管理委員會某負責人，承告：本市煤斤主要來源，為開灤及臺灣產區。最近兩地到滬煤斤，每月約達十六萬噸。此中開灤煤礦約佔十二萬噸，臺灣產區約佔四萬噸。而本市每月經常耗用，不過十三萬噸，故調劑尚不感困難。惟目前北寗路又有中斷之訊，對開灤煤之南運，不無相當影響。所幸本市現尚有存煤七八萬噸，故煤斤一時尚不致發生恐慌。現因北方煤斤來源受阻，故行政院特訓令將國外輸入之煤斤，統由該會收買分配，以謀抑平煤價。該會平日配售煤斤，以公用事業，鐵路及輪船交通事業，最佔優先。次及各生產工廠及各煤商。平均每月配售煤斤情形，計公用事業約三萬噸，鐵路輪船交通事業約五萬噸，滬寗線一帶之公用事業約二萬噸，各生產工廠約三萬噸，各煤商約一萬噸。　　又據本市煤商業同業公會負責人語記者稱：該會所屬會員，雖達一千餘家。惟十九皆兼營柴炭為業。蓋煤斤缺乏後，已不能專恃販煤為業矣。進出口銀行　　擬聘王寵惠主持　　據悉：本市進出口業發起組織之中國進出口銀行，近設籌備處於溪口路十二號四樓，籌備主任為進出口業公會理事長張煥章氏，并擬邀請外交界名宿王寵惠博士為該行主持人，資金暫定二十億元，聞業已開始招股。但據財政部錢幣司司長戴銘禮稱，財部尚未接有該業申請登記之呈文，惟新設銀行一律不準設立，政府早有規定，不能破壞法規，關於新銀行法，現尚在立法院審議中云。陳茶趨勢仍俏　　紅綠茶本街店莊銷場，仍未稍衰，至于洋莊茶市，陳貨花色，一致趨俏，臺灣細紅茶，到存均涸，粗紅及祁門花香脫手愈益順利，據同業消息，摩洛哥，埃及兩地，對華茶，亦有需要，惜因船隻關係，未能運銷，聞目前正在設法籌措中。中美電影技術合作　貝而浩派代表來華　　〔本報訊〕美國芝加哥貝而浩廠，為美國最著名之電影材料製造廠，近因電影技術設備之進步，攸關中國電化教育之推展，故對於中美電影技術合作問題，極端注意，除已委託中國電影器材供應公司，為在華獨家經理外，特派電化教育專家柯蘭夫人為該廠駐遠東總代表，關於在華設廠及電影技術合作問題，該總代表已與國防部電影製片廠廠長羅靜予，曁中國電影照相器材供應公司總經理壽景偉及京滬兩地之電化教育專家極詳盡討論，一俟中國時局好轉，此項中美電影技術合作之計劃，即可具體實現。美國人的意見　中美貿易不易推進　匯價不與物價并管　雖經調整亦屬徒然　　〔合眾社紐約二十九日電〕著名經濟雜誌「商業週刋」最近登載評論，謂美國商人發展對華貿易之計劃可以「無限期擱置」，又稱中國調整匯價而不勵行物價管制，實屬徒然。中國政府最近貶低法幣之價值，目的為減輕中國出口貨之成本。結果物價高漲，美貨較前騰貴百分之四十該雜誌於檢討與美國進出口業前途有關之整個國外貿易時稱：「世界各地現正發生戰事，致使戰後商業及海外發展之範圍日益縮小。」寶大祥老店新張　　〔本報訊〕綢布門售字號巨擘寶大祥原設總店於小東門，通稱老店，戰後始收歇，而移其重心於八仙橋今址，現以市面漸趨正常，秋銷又將上市，正在積極籌備，將老店復業，日期當在中秋月滿之時云。賡豐經銷生油　係受中食委托　　〔本報訊〕昨據賡豐行負責人語記者稱：該行自本年二月份起，受中國食油公司之委託，開始代售該公司之生油。通常售價，常較市價每担低廉三四千元。該行純係代理性質，從未向零售商店收取佣金。該項生油，一經成交，款項亦由零售商號，直接繳付中國食油公司。至其他各油廠，亦均由各該廠派員駐公會自理買賣，并不純限該行獨家經理云斛司制度恢復　　本市戰前原有斛司制度，戰時中止，茲經斛司業工會要求，社會局已允於九月十六日起恢復，該斛司工會并與米業工會簽訂協定，（一）斛司之膳宿由資方供給，（二）斛司抽取千分之三之斛費，不得有其它勒索，資方亦不能隨意尅扣，（三）斛司所得之斛費，如不足以維持生活時，得由資方酌予補助。米市店胃不健　中下貨續回小　　昨南北米市到消兩平，陳貨漸成零落，均將以新貨為主，早色新粳秈逐步到申，中色正在收割時，中秋左右，亦可抵申，市化店方揀高進取，中下等少神乏交，回小一二千元，白元來貨雖乏，而為價太高，消路轉形呆滯，兩市客貨登記，共五千餘石，麺粉廠盤照舊，但開出不多，場外市價早市尚可，午時轉懈，略回小一二百元，小麥油廈泉州均選高貨，油市開價均照審議價格，菜油略軟，豆油緊俏，豆餅油頭雖微有去化，但已落令，故反下挫二三百元，麩皮鄉消不惡，再加一二百元。第一批日本茶　下月初可抵美　　〔路透社紐約廿九日電〕戰事結束以來之第一批日本茶葉，九月初即可運達美國西岸，該批茶葉計共一，五〇〇，〇〇〇磅，第二批茶葉，十月中亦可抵達紐約，在此後五個月中，約五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅之茶葉將自日本運來美國。物價管制局對於茶葉限價，尚未確定。銀根日緊　　傳節前不易鬆動　　最近本市銀根頗緊暗息日高，其原因由於（一）中央銀行無限制拋售黃金吸收通貨，（二）紡建公司拋售巨額紗布，（三）中央信託局代理出售政府物資委員會敵偽產業處理局，中國植物油料廠，市政府物資接管處，江海關等各機構，均奉令加強拋售物資，（四）證券交易市場核準之經紀人二三四名，奉令每人繳納保證金二千萬元，總數達四十六億八千萬元，故在中秋節以前銀根不易趨鬆云。匯率調整後　豬鬃出口仍乏起色　　自外匯調整後，豬鬃外銷，并未轉佳，一般產商，均隨匯率變動將價格提高，上海鬃在外匯未變更前，售價每箱約三十五萬至四十萬元之間，迨新匯率公佈後，跟蹤外匯上升，每箱漲至五十五萬元，但美國市場，售價相反下跌，由每磅一元八角五分，降至一元七角，經營此業者，均徘徊觀望，頗感困難，政府提高匯率之本旨，原為鼓勵土產出口，今一般產地商人只顧牟利，致主要出口品之豬鬃，并未因外匯之調整而改善，實違當局之本意。　　又訊，美因有拋售豬鬃存貨之消息，我豬鬃外銷略受影響，截至目前為止，美商仍多存觀望，胃口不大，本月份出口數量大為減少，四川畜產公司等出口商僅運出九百担，較上月減二分之一，日來美國市價，仍未穩定，尚在下跌，川鬃由每磅三角二分，下跌三角一分五，漢口鬃由四角三，跌至四角一。收購絲價已核定　每担為三百八十萬元　　我絲業自外匯調整後，因為外絲價之低落，政府決以貼補政策救濟，并決定生絲，由中央信託局收購，茲悉收購絲價，業經經濟農林兩部斟酌各廠之生產成本，審慎核議，定為每担三百八十萬元，此次之絲價，係由兩部主管人根據各廠業務管理，所購原料燃料工價核定，自較合理，有利廠商，惟廠商方面以外匯調整後，其他物價上漲，生產成本已在四百萬元以上，希望增為每担四百萬元，聞政府方面決不再予考慮。生絲本月出口二千担　　我國絲業此次未因外匯調整而轉好，此中原因，係遭美國絲價低落之打擊，本月份我出口業均未敢運美交易，我D級絲價，曾由每磅九元跌至六元六角三分，雖曾一度回漲至七元五，本日（三十日）據中蠶公司所接美國電報，美又有拍賣日本絲五千包之消息，復趨下跌，D級絲跌至七元，A級絲為八元，以目前之外匯來計算，D級絲每担為三百萬元，但除運費，保險費，美火車裝費等，約計四十萬元外，祗二百六十萬元，故我出口業，對美市場，均裹足不前，目前我絲業之銷場，以印度為最大，其次為歐洲英·法·瑞士諸國，其價均高於美國，印度每磅價為三千七百元盧比，折合國幣三百一十餘萬，本月出口廠絲及土絲計二千担，十分之九，均屬印度，英·法等國不過二百担，印度刻以日本絲低價之誘惑，今後我在印之市場，難免不受打擊。</p>

<p>邵伯大戰目擊記  本報廿七日揚州航訊　特派員杭舟　　蘇北行之五　　八月廿三日起，蘇北第二階段的戰事展開了。　　第一階段戰事從共軍進犯揚泰起，至國軍反擊打通揚泰，海泰，揚天路爲止。其結果是：共軍的主力遭受挫傷，國軍確保了大江的安全，晦暗的蘇北局勢現出了幾分光明。　　第二階段戰事展開之間，有一個沉悶的過程。在這過程中，國軍雖佔有軍事的優勢，仍期望共黨覺悟，和平談判成功，故沒有主動去進攻共軍。但共軍獲得了這一段空隙，却積極地調兵遣將，作新的部署。在山東作戰的徐向前部三萬多人（或許還不止），調到了蘇北，佈置在與國軍對峙的前綫上。這一批兵力，頗有作戰經騐，不比烏合之衆，可謂是共軍的「老本錢」，拿到蘇北來，很有孤注一擲之勢。　　面具的揭開　　暴露共黨猙獰面目的是它自己所下的總動員令，這消息，蘇北將士聽了冷笑幾聲。事實上，共黨早就以全力向國民政府作戰了。不過，過去它還有一套紙糊的面具，現在，則像戲台上的花臉一樣是「露了臉了」。一位少校警長對記者說：「中國人參加了共產黨，就好像變做外國人了。」記者說：「不是這樣，共產黨自己知道沒有它政治的生命」。　　在這種情勢下，國軍不能不有所準備。於是，當共軍企圖由邵伯·橋墅·丁溝再犯揚泰時，國軍發動還擊。大戰的幕拉開了！　　大戰的前夕，－八月廿二日，記者已隨軍至仙女廟。這裏是揚泰·仙邵·揚靖（至靖江）三條公路的交叉點。運河經由這裏靜靜地流到揚州，正如它美麗的名字，這是一個風景幽美的鎮市，以往商賈雲集，運河裏白帆點點，北上南下，熙來攘往，臻成了這鎮市的繁榮。現在，在這個大戰的第一個節目中，它擔當了主要的角色　　仙女廟距揚州十八華里，距邵伯亦是十八華里，人們走着前十八里路時，便想着後十八里路。揚州和仙女廟的人民最關心的莫過於邵伯了：共軍佔有邵伯，好像扼住了他們的咽喉，使他們不能暢快地透氣，不能安心地睡眠。當國軍大批地來到了這鎮市，麻木了的公路上又掀起了巨大的塵灰，敏感的居民們便笑了。他們自動地貢獻出了軍事行動需要的一切，他們期待着喝一次痛快的酒。　　戰鬥的號角　　廿三日清晨五點半鐘，天剛剛亮，雄雞的一聲長啼，像是戰鬥的號角，前方正式接觸了，國軍是分三路還擊共軍的：第一路以橋墅爲最先目樣，再會攻邵伯；第二路直取邵伯；第三路係水面進攻，亦以邵伯爲目標物。這三路都是由仙女廟出發的。另外，還有從宜陵出發的一路，爲前三路之助攻擔當這任務的是番號「武德」的黃百韜師長所部。這部隊是共產黨的「冤家」；當共軍在江西作流寇式的　擾時期，黃師便是給予最大打擊的一個；現在經過八年對日戰爭以後，又相逢在蘇北的原野上。「知己知彼」，黃師長說：「爲作戰要訣」。他以「穩紮穩打」著稱，這次被迫的還擊，他在部署上就根據「穩紮穩打」。　　至於共軍的兵力，在數量上較國軍爲多。邵伯原有一個團，後來增至二個團，到戰事最激烈時增至三個團；橋墅附近原有一個團，後來增至二個團，橋墅以北五汶港，楊家莊等地還有二個團，在高郵則有七團之衆，待機而動。其中，有些是徐向前部，有些是張鼎臣部，有些是地方團隊改編爲正規軍的。　　廿三日一天中國軍獲得的戰果是鉅大的：第一路於上午十一時半邵佔領橋墅，分兵迂迴邵伯；第二路在進兵時又分爲二路：一路於上午十時佔領六閘，一路向沙江壩挺進。兩路如一雙鐵鉗，把邵伯緊緊夾住，水上一路自邵伯湖向岸上轟擊，亦給共軍以重大威脅。　　下午五點鐘，前方　戰正烈，國軍集中砲火，準備一舉攻入邵伯，忽然天色變化，大雨傾盆，戰塲上一片泥潭，記者正自劉家莊師部乘吉普車返仙女廟，被大雨刮得像落湯雞一樣。我豎起耳朵聽前方的砲火，沉寂下來了。　　大戰第二天　　廿四日是——大戰第二天，記者一早便趕到沙江壩最前綫去。記者獲悉這一天國軍準備從沙江壩渡沙河；河那邊便是邵伯。在離開火綫二里的地方，我下了吉普車，徒步前進。戰地的交　樂熱烈地演奏着：砲聲隆隆，機槍格格，步槍聲「劈」，或者是「絲」，這音樂令人驚心動魄的！我躺在大砲旁邊的草地上，和將士們撩天：他們鎮定極了，把打仗當遊戲一樣，他們已有一天一夜沒有睡覺，但精神好極了，「他奶奶的，這一砲打去一定是頭彩」！一位射擊手發過一砲後，見到砲彈落下去的地方，黑烟起來了，他這樣說。我站在一個土墩上用望遠鏡瞭望，邵伯的一房一屋都瞭如指掌，只看不到人。人都躲在工事裏面。「對方的火力被壓住不能發揮，曾經發過幾砲，砲彈只有手榴彈太少，落地亦不爆炸」。一位尉官這樣告訴我，他吐了口痰。　　蘇北到處是河流，在邵伯，更是河流交錯，它的西邊是運河，及邵伯湖，只有一條狹得不能三個人並走的運河堤，它的南邊有大小三道河作爲天然的屏障，東邊，更隔着一個愛　湖。有這樣險要的地形，再加上工事：一道運河堤上，由六閘至邵伯入口處的南大王廟便有七道工事，沿鎮河更是工事密佈，在僞政府時代，和平軍在這兒已經建築了不少工事，共軍又把它加強。工事都做得很低，簡直不易發現。每一道工事，均有地下道可通，工事裏一半是水。　　國軍採取的方法是「敵前強渡」。一聲號令下，廿四日下午五點鐘，國軍有一個連衝過河去了。這捷報，傳到揚州，傳到鎮江，報館都發了號外。可是因爲天晚的關係，國軍爲避免犧牲計，衝入鎮內的又退了回來。這一仗，已使共軍胆顫心裂，當時便由高郵增到了援軍千餘人。　　這千餘人，據所獲情報，大半是被共軍利用的日俘，所以戰鬥技術較佳。日軍作戰的習慣是看不見人不打，任何大砲轟擊，他都一動不動。廿五日——大戰第三日，國軍遭遇的便是這樣。　　這一天，戰事的中心在南大王廟。記者乘砲艇到六閘，前方砲火較昨日尤熾，我在一所民房內休憇，一位中年婦人給我倒了一杯白開水，我問她：「你們怕不怕」？　　「你們不來我們怕，你們來了我們不怕了」！她答得很巧妙，坐在一旁的弟兄們聽了都笑了。　　可能的變化　　戰爭激烈進行着，劉清昶團長率領他的部隊一步步推進，破了一道鐵絲網，又破了一道鐵絲網，越過一個戰壕，再越過一個戰壕，……昔日關雲長破五關斬六將，現在劉團的弟兄們一直破了七道關，使那些受命於暴徒的遺屍遍野，直衝到工事最堅固折大王廟。下午六點鍾，大王廟收復了！一聲歡呼，壯士氣振，繼之邵伯巷戰在夜幕下展開了，記者歸去時，和士兵們相約明日在邵伯午餐。　　可是，當天晚上十二點鍾，傳來兩泰告急的警報，這是一個突變。密集於兩泰附近之共軍爲挽救邵伯的頹勢，於廿五日向黃橋，搬涇鎮發動突擊。該地國軍兵力單薄，遭受包圍。廿六日，國軍援兵開到，才解了圍。因此之故，邵伯爭奪戰轉趨沉寂。戰局的重心或許要移到右邊去了。　　到目前爲止，邵伯鎮內尚有共軍約三千人，此後戰局可能再有新變化。據悉：東台共軍聚集甚衆，有發動大規模攻勢模樣。如果此訊屬實，那末，蘇北第二階段戰事的第二節目就要上演了！（上）本報特派員（右起第一人）與首先攻入南大王廟之一二〇團團長劉清昶（右起第三人）等合影。（下）運河中之國軍砲艇。（杭舟攝）</p>

<p>春秋談木刻藝術  只良黻　　木刻藝術在戰時曾風行而轟動在自由區的每一個角落裏，這美果的獲得，一方面是一般作者的創作作風得到大眾的喜悅，一方面是客觀環境的迫切需要。由於主觀與客觀互相的，於是它就形成了戰時藝術運動中最活躍的一環，當時，各地木研分會的的蜂起，各種木藝刊物的出版，全國性的木刻作品在各地流動展覽，處處都呈現着木刻的輝煌成就與光明的前途。　　然而，目前的情形呢？已大不同了——慢慢的在鑽牛角尖了！我不是一個悲觀主義者，但是檢討一下目前的形勢，我對它的前途已經減少了像過去那樣一股的熱望！　　這有因可以分兩點申述：　　第一，就木藝的本身講：過去的作品，作者除了注意刀味和木味以外，對於構圖也重視着幽美的情調。近來來一班作家過分的講究「刀法」及修改的發展。致使作品變成了只能供作家們欣賞，普通一班人看不懂，（如作家中的潘仁·阿楊諸先生作品常有　種情形，最近出版的新一號「木刻藝術」裏的作品也有如此者）事實上這是一個作家造詣走上高深的境域的必然現象，也是未可抑止的現象，而一班新進作者，影響所及，爭相模仿，創造了一種風氣。於是「看不懂」的這一問題也就更嚴重，這一問題的更嚴重，它民必然的如同未來派達達派一樣的在不懂中漸趨沒落。　　第二，就客觀的環境講：木藝作家戰時都遍佈在國內各地；無論在木運的推行上，工作的連擊上，都起着全國性的作用與深入民間的作用。而京滬一帶的客觀環境是怎麼樣呢？由於木刻畫的畫面比不過金屬版的「美」甚而至於看不懂而減少了它的客觀需要。同時海上人士過去對於木刻作品印象不深，現在也沒有把它克服過來！　　基於主觀與客觀的都不能納入正軌，我不禁對木運的前途，起着懷疑和焦慮！也壓制不住的要向木藝作家們高喊着：「改變你們的作風吧，不能再鑽牛角了！」珍珠花  胡朔　　不見母親已有好幾個年頭了，翹首雲天，想起遠方受難的母親，內心就會勾起深切的懷念。尤其使我不能忘記的，是母親為了她兒子繳納學費，曾經賣去珍珠花的那個故事。　　呵，珍珠花！現在我以嚴肅痛切的心情，寫下「珍珠花」三個字，握着禿筆的右手不禁顫憟起來，我有些鼻酸眼漲！彷佛母親慈祥的衰老的面影又在我的眼前幌動了。　　珍珠花纖長的柄尖，刺痛我的心，戳着我的靈魂。想起母親鮮明的記憶搖曳在腦際，我不能忘記那個生動眞切的故事。　　那是十五年前故事——　　那一年夏天，家鄉鬧旱，鄉間的田禾多半給炎陽的流火燒枯了，為了防荒，家中春季收穫的幾石麥子要留着做口糧，不能變賣。父親為了我秋季的學費，想盡了方法，奔走了幾天，結果一點路子也沒有。母親不肯讓我中途輟學，一定要我完成最後一年的中學課程，在一個初秋的晚上，她用顫巍巍的手從箱子裏取出她年靑插在頭上的裝飾品——那一枝赤金柄　的，用纖細的銅絲穿紥成的約摸一百多粒的珍珠花，她決定賣掉她心愛的飾品，湊足兒子應　學費。　　「媽！你不能……為了我，賣掉你珍貴的東西。……」我望着父親瘦削的面龐，一把拖住母親的手，我感動得說不出別的話來。　　父親站在一旁，抽着煙，彷佛相信什麼似的沉默着。母親卻急躁的向我說了：「你不要跟我糾纏！快些放手！……為了你求學，我已經打定主意，決定賣掉它……」。　　我無可如何的縮回手，母親上氣不接下氣地喘息着。　　沉默了半響，她忽然想起了什麼似的壓低了嗓子：　　學校只剩兩天就開學了，你今晚上早些去睡覺。你放心，行李和衣服用物都替你弄好了。……明天一早我和你趕早班汽車上城，我決定送你進校。不，為了賣掉珍珠花，我非本人跑一趟不可，這些事你們男人是不會細心的。……你們不好意思和人家較量呢！……　　我絲聽着母親的話，一陣莫名的悲哀黏住了我。隔着室內瀰漫的煙霧，再偷偷地瞟了父親和母親一眼，我彷佛發現兩個老人的眼眶都有什麼亮晶晶的東西在燈光下閃爍着。……　　第二天一早，母親教人先挑運行李箱子，送上車站。她把珍珠花小心地包藏好，塞在內衣袋裏，便拐着小脚和我一齊走出家門。　　我那裡已有十七八歲，在N城讀書多年，那裏的每條街道，都很熟悉，自信拿一枝珍珠花向銀樓求售的能力總還有，我好幾次哀求母親把珍珠花交給我，請她老人家不必陪我去，可是母親總是那麼固執，一定要自家去辦理才算放心。　　我沒有辦法阻止她，一種偉大的愛的潛力激動了我，壓制了我，使我第一次體味到人間母愛的甜暖。在路上，我三五次的向母親說：「媽！把你的珍珠花賣去來付我的學費，已經太對不起你了。……你放心你的兒子，就把那個交給我，你本人可以不必去，趁早往返有一百多里，太累了你！……」　　可是母親態度一直那麼堅決，執拗：「不，這是我應該做的事，我非本人去不可！賣一枝珍珠花完成你的讀書，在我是件愉快的事情。……」　　就是這麼着，我們一路嘮叨着，一直到N城。　　到了N城，母親先和我坐黃包車把行李雜物寄存在學校傳達室，接着母子倆便一齊找銀樓去，這時已經下午一時左右。　　走進一家最大的銀樓，母親便把身邊的珍珠花取出來，伸出一隻顫巍巍的手遞給那個麻皮夥計。　　母親喘着氣，冒著汗，然而卻強作鎭靜的樣子微笑着：「先生，你看看，這枝金柄的珍珠花賣給你値幾個錢」？　　那個麻皮傲慢地接過去，拿在手裏摸了又摸，看了又看，過了半響，才吞吞吐吐的說：「珍珠是頂括的，不過光澤有些凝滯，柄是赤金的，我們照牌價算錢，……珍珠我們店裏賣出的多，收進的少，……你一定要脫手，價錢要照高價打折扣，……」麻皮不屑地望着母親一笑，露出二顆金牙，更顯出他市僧的狡詐和卑劣的態度來，我傾聽這塲「交易」的談話，一陣不可遏止的憤懣擒住了我，我挨近母親的身邊，打算向她建議再跑第二家，但母親卻搶先開口了：「你說價錢吧！只要差不多，就可以賣給你。請你客氣些，老實說，賣掉這枝珍珠花，是為了……」　　我伸出一隻手拉了拉她的衣角，這才打斷她下面要吐出的話。憤怒的火，在我的心里燃燒，我有些埋怨母親說話太缺乏藝術，可是另一種愛的力量卻又把我制服住不能動彈了。　　我和母親像罪犯似的立在櫃台邊，彼此沉默着，又彷佛兩段木頭。聽憑那個麻皮宣吿珍珠花的價格。……麻皮說了：珍珠花一共是百二十粒，每粒四角五分。金柄三錢五分，照每兩八十元進價計算，値二十八元。珍珠値五十四元，共計八十二元。他末了還斬釘截鐵地來一句：「要賣就是這價錢」！　　我回過頭去望母親，她在苦笑着。……她低下頭，沉思了一會，像考慮什麼似的。最後她說：　　「呵，四角五分一粒！我的珍珠花祇値四角五分嗎？……你瞧，粒粒都是渾圓的，現在我來得直爽，金柄　照牌價算，可是珍珠的價錢要請你加一點，最少也要五角錢！五角錢，一分也不能少」！　　母親像辦理一件重大的交涉似的，向那個麻皮抗議着。　　可是，麻皮卻搖着光滑滑的腦袋。　　嘮叨了一陣子，交易依舊沒結果。　　最後，母親終於讓步了：「那麼就照四角八分一粒算吧」！　　母親的「較量」總算獲致了成功——麻皮點頭答應了。　　我呆呆地望着麻皮把母親的珍珠花送進裏面去，隨着又看見他拿出一疊薄薄的鈔票遞到母親顫巍巍的手中，一陣痛楚像一枝火煎似的射穿了我的心靈！……　　拖着學生的腳步隨着母親走出銀樓，回到學校門口，母親把那疊鈔票塞到我手里，拍拍我的肩膀：「這里一共有八十五元六角，除去繳校六十幾元外，還有十幾塊錢，買書，零用，目前大槪可夠了。……孩子，只要將來能做一個有用的結實的人，我什麼都願意……以後無錢用，侭可寫信回來，家中這些年經濟雖窘，加之今年年成又壞，……不過，你放心，只要是正當用途，我無論如何總得設法，……」　　我點點頭，母親的話一字一句的響在我的耳邊，我的心被震撼得忐忑跳躍，母愛深深地感動了我，愛的溫流從心坎的深處溢出，又沿眼角　　地滴下來。……　　「不要難過！不要記念父母，在外面身體要保重，記着，只要在學校里努力讀書，就算報答我們了。……」母親撫摩着我的肩，微笑着。末了她又說：「你現在可以進校了，……時候已經不早，我還得趕車回家。你進去罷，記着，把自己的床鋪整理好，晚上不要受涼。……」好慈祥地瞟我一眼，這才艱難地搬動着小脚，慢慢地向對面一條街道走去。　　我睜開給淚水模糊了的眼睛，望着那個瘦矮的背影慢慢地消失在遠處的煙塵里。……　　我流着澄清的淚水衷心地感激母親：那一年鄉下鬧荒，因了她的一枝珍珠花，我才沒有輟學。我更感激母親，因了她的一枝珍珠花，使人從那一次以的，澈悟了應該怎樣堅苦地做人!可是，珍珠花的鮮明的記憶，卻不知怎麼的像永遠在我的心靈上黏上一層悲哀，使我時常痛苦！　　十五年了，一串悠長的煙一樣的日子。……時光　輪軸的飛轉，帶走了我年靑時的好夢似的光陰，結束了我的學生生活，九年前，我跨出學校的門檻，投入社會服務了。　　八九年來，為了做人，為了生活，不辭勞苦的在烽煙中東奔西走，總算沒有完全教母親失望！但生活的鐵鎚，卻殘酷鞭答着我的肩，痛擊着我的靈魂，窮困一直纏繞着我，使我不能得到片刻的休息，而燎原的烽火，漫天的毒煙，更使我沒有機緣能探望一下年老的母親！每當風雨晨昏，一個人給孤寂圍繞着的時候，相信遠方受難的年老的母親，珍珠花的故事就驀地浮起心頭。母親的愛子之心太使我感動了，想起珍珠花，內心就充滿了歉疚。　　天下的母親都是疼愛着她們的兒子的，都希望她們的兒子做一個堅實有用的人，為了兒子的成長，她們忍受一切的苦難，甚至犧牲一切，只要兒子不負她們的期待，她們認為在精神上就獲致了寄託我報酬。母親曾以愛的蜜汁溫暖過我，不，她犧牲了自己，把自己的珍貴的血液灌輸給了我，哺育並且教養了我，她曾抱着那麼熱切的期望，像教徒祝禱似的希冀着她的兒子能夠做一個堅實有用的人，和天下的母親一樣。……　　可是，做兒子的我，太對不起她老人家了。十五年前，母親變賣了她的飾品珍珠花，為的是兒子的前途！可是我到現在一直沒有堪足教人滿意的成就來報答老人的期待。這些年來，母親在淪陷區裏，嘗遍了酸辛，受盡了驚唬，我連一次的探省都沒有！因了窮困生活的磨折，甚至連買一枝珍珠花補償給母親的能力也沒有！……想到這裏，我彷彿聽到遠方老人的痛苦而又失望的嘆息，我的良心受着嚴酷的責罰！　　慈愛的年老的母親喲！這些年來，你的兒子遭受的痛苦太深了！想有那麼一天，讓我從遼遠的天涯奔到遼闊的海角，跪在你的面前，沉痛地懺悔罷！眺望着沒有熄滅的烽火，現在，我謹以嚴肅誠摯的默禱，祝福你平安健康！秋  鄭震刻嚼  楊謀　　我把一顆心咀嚼，　　我要辨它的苦味，我要把它磨滅，　　也不知是什麼力量，我的心，老痛楚地發着痙，空閑襲到時間的領域來的時候，它便是不可恕的內線，把歷史重新映演一遍。　　人類是多麼矛盾。幸福和舒服放在脚邊，往往敝屣地去棄，卻又遙遠地找覓痛苦。人類都願意替自己佈下了陷穽，卻又讓自己去拚着生命探索。　　生命是沒有答案的，恁是咀嚼也只是雞零狗碎的拚湊。　　當你為自己的生命求得了答案時，你只能把它長埋在黃土中了。人生是不可解的，也正因不可解，每個人都在自作聰明地解着。　　最怎麼的是人，最豪爽的又何嘗不是？　　錙銖必較的是人，奉獻生命甘受痛苦的，卻也是人。——人真是一個謎。　　咀嚼，咀嚼，把心挖了出來，再咀嚼了下去，依然是一無所得，除了帶給你更多的悵惘。似的，向那個麻皮抗議着。一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風19　　「差不了多少——以前跟我大伯打游擊，老是我領路，放警哨，我能看到一里開外的小雀鳥。」一里相當於五百米遠。　　我的腦筋中裝潢了科學的條件，和傳奇神秘現實的矛盾。譬如這麼一點年紀的孩子，怎麼可以徒手就能殺人，而且是那樣的猛烈。爽利；好像擺枯拉朽似的？　　想起從前中學時代，一位姓黃的江西同學。他的同鄉說他能「點穴」衹要手指一戳，就能致人死命，小說裏面常有這樣的記載。這件事，大槪我的同學都能記得。最奇怪的，雖然沒看見他施展點穴手段，可是無論白天默認，你問他幾點鍾，他總能說得相當準確。據他說，人身血流，固然每分鐘要週流全身兩轉，（以馬體每廿八秒鍾週流一轉為根據。）然而另外有一種氣，去是按　夜二十四小時流轉全身穴道一週。祇要知道這氣在何時，走到那一穴道，也祇要用他練過功夫的手指一戳，就能把穴道閉了，於是麻煩就來了；死，或是殘廢。　　又想到某雜誌裏報導過，紐約特別警察G—Man提人的時候，如對方相當利害，警察用手掌在對方後頸一砍，對方就能週身麻木，束手待縛；並且說這個手法，是日本傳過去的。我也問過同事西人，一位專教體育的拳術家，他承認這是事實。　　「你會點穴嗎……還是另外的手上功夫？」我想到那兩個傢伙的傷痕。　　「不，我練「陰陽掌」，同紅沙手黑沙手差不多，可是我這手不帶毒；」孩子很天眞的說。　　這種種傳奇式的現實，似乎暫時剋服了我的科學知識。我也明白鶴兄在計劃上北平去接洽耀　和特務機構方面的事，再三主張讓小老虎來陪伴我。一方面固然有其他關係，一方面恐怕就是為了他這驚人的手脚。　　「咱們現在又得上道哪，」我想到時間已經不早了。　　「嗌，」—江南蘇州人念「愛」字的聲調—這是北地人表示服從或造成的口氣；「我知道怎麼走，要是沒打攪，大槪一小時多一點，可以趕到，單怕前門都關上哪——你想，打的這們熱門？」他一邊吃麥　，一邊說着。　　「到了那裏再說吧」。計劃的時候，沒想到會這們大範圍打起來的　　他現在又實任編導的職務了。不僅眼睛好，耳朵也極靈，這大槪是在關外訓練出來的。他有時叫我停，有時扒在地上，有時急走，有時走一步探一步；好像獵人在追尋野獸，或野獸在躲避獵人，有時從包米田，或從森林穿過去，有時還得涉過不大深的溪水。他時時還　　到我動作和走路的低能。</p>

<p>自由談生活指數  少夫　　八月份工人生活總指數昨天已發表了，為四五三·六七四·六二，公布內文載較上月份略漲〇·九四七〇。按七月份為四四九·四二〇·　二八，實際上僅漲四·二五四·三四，茲列表如下：　　七月份　四四九，四二〇·二八　　八月份　四五三，六七四·六二　　實漲　四，二五四·三四　　幾乎百分之一還不到。這頗令人納罕！因為我們知道，以來，油，糖，小菜……等等而論，七月份與八月份的比較，決不止增加百分之一。我們對於生活指數的計算方法是外行，但開門七件事，柴米油鹽醬醋菜的價格我們是曉得的。　　市府統計室可以不可以將計算的方法和根據什麽資料公開發表一下哩！因為這樣可以增加市民一種經濟學上的常識，同時更可以祛除一般人對於這數字是否正確的懷疑。天堂裏有地獄　衣食住行　在上海  　　身居上海，對於上海人的生活情形，不可不知。　　順照次序，先談衣：　　衣冠世界　　繁華都市，虛榮塲所，衣服裝飾，處處遭人注意，假如穿的是撲素衣裳，走入高貴的消費塲地，準定受人白眼。反過來說：寒風凜冽之中，遇見一位披「灰背」，衣「紫貂」的淑女，紳士，不知有多少人，投以羨慕的目光。　　第一流的「時裝公司」，分佈在四個地點：（一）南京西路，跑馬廳一帶，（二）南京路浙江路以東，（三）大新街附近，（四）林森路中段。富家的老爺，太太，少爺，小姐，是他們的常年主顧。一襲新衣，往往可抵貧戶半年糧。　　吳淞路和林森路東首，結集了好幾家舊西裝店，雖然名義上是舊衣肆，可是登門的顧客，多是衣冠整齊的少年，一次交易，時常在十數萬以上。　　一般平民，解決衣的問題，大都喜歡到石路去，那兒有十幾家面對着面的佔衣莊，出售衣服，春，夏，秋，冬皆備，來源盡是滿期的原當貨，由他們收買得來的，每件陳列出來的衣服，都有紙籤標明價格，　一不二，開口還價，便要自討沒趣。　　寗波路一帶，有幾家專做中式短衫褲的成衣店，進出的多為土頭獃腦的鄉下人。　　口福不淺　　輪到了食：　　上海人的口福不壞，各地方的飲食，如：蘇州幫，當錫幫，湖州幫，寗波幫，杭州幫，粵菜，閩菜，川菜，西菜，俄國大菜，色色俱全。祇要袋裏有錢，你儘可以吃到蘇州幫最拿手的「炒蝦仁」，或者寗波菜中最著名的槽八斗。　　從車夫，苦力到鉅商名流，都有供給他們飲食的所在，從貴族的大飯店數到街邊的飯攤，中間簡直不知道分多少階級。　　用幾個統計數字來說明上海人的「食量」吧，上海目前共有菜塲二十餘處，肉肆七百幾十家，平均每天殺豬二千五百頭。　　上海人每日所需的食物，除了蔬菜由近郊的閔行，龍華，浦東，高橋，吳淞，江灣供給以外，牛隻是來自潮南，湖北，山東，安徽，浙江和蘇北，羊隻來自湖州。豬隻來自東台，南通，如皋，海州和泰興一帶。　　眼前上海，屋荒成災，有錢還覓不到合意的房屋，一個小房間，頂費數百萬，令人憶起二十五年的時候，「法租界」的空屋無人居，全市六百餘家旅館貶價出租的情形，當時開一日房間，小的祇需四五角錢，而且還有折扣。　　談到上海的住屋，令人起了「天堂·地獄」的感慨。　　觸目驚心　　以下是「國際飯店」開業時向外界的公告，一字未易：「這裏有的是：窮人們從沒看到過的華貴傢倶，這裏更有的是：窮人們從沒有想到過的巧妙的設備，而且一切採用最新式的，立體的，精緻的，不是說一句過份的話：人睡其中，宛如睡在迷人的仙宮，或如在前世紀皇后的寢宮」。　　再看一看下面；二十六年的統計，上海共有棚戶四千家，人數五十萬人。所謂棚戶，就是那些貧苦無吿的苦力小販之流，集合起來，在無主的空地上，用蘆蓆柴草廢木鉛皮，搭成豬圈羊欄似的的棚舍，底下便是泥土，昏暗霉腐的氣味，衝人欲嘔，遇有大風雨，頂漏地濕，疾病死亡更免不了。　　天堂·地獄，視比何異？　　最後說上海人的行：　　上海最早的交通工具是人力車和汽車。　　　　　淸同治十年，由法人米拉從日本輸入人力車。　　「光緒二十七年匈牙利人李恩時將汽車運入「公共租界〕。　　馬車漸為淘汰。光緒三十四年元月，「法租界」開始行駛有軌電車。　　上海市塲繁榮，一日千里，交通器具，供不應求，中華民國十三年十月九日，第一輛公共汽車在上海「租界」出現。　　全盛時代的上海交通情形，計有電車二十五路，公共汽車十五路，單以英商電車公司而言，已有電車一〇七輛及拖車一〇七輛，自備汽車五五八一輛，營業汽車五八九輛，人力車二萬輛。　　人人自危　　根據二十七·八兩年的兩「租界」車輛肇事統計：廿七年共」五一八三起，死傷五一六六人。廿八年共一三八九二起，死傷五一六四人。勝利以後，軍車目中無人，電車目中無客，往難行亦不易？尤其軍車闖禍，造成畢勛路一類慘案，真使全市市民人人自危！（甘來）勸募人語　推銷國貨券  　　國貨代價券只能向商號推銷，不能入娛樂塲所，或向行人推銷，真是一大苦事。跑遍半個上海，二日間不曾捐着一錢，只捐了十包沒人要的力士牙粉三瓶紅藥水。　　國貨市塲一半為提倡國貨，一半為助學，因而推銷代價券，比以前的助學章困難百倍。不是學生本身想出的方法，總不能體諒學生為學生着想。　　有人說二十號已有人在推銷代價券。時至今日，肯熱心慷慨解囊的早已捐過，也不會作第二次的解囊；不肯的至今仍是不肯　　吾們一小隊中有人打趣着說：「如周方白先生肯捐一軸百萬的畫給本隊，我們就可坐享這學期的貸金了。國畫不也可列入國貨市塲內義賣嗎？」（彜郭）補白  愛斯　　肥胖而粗俗的主婦：「我怕一輩子不容易穿得好看吧？」　　時裝專家：「不過，夫人，你懂得笑的功用，你不是能使人家快樂嗎？」　　教授：「我有二十年教學的經騐，怎麽沒有照情加薪？」　　校長：「朋友呵！實在你沒有二十年的經騐的，你祇是把一年的經騐重複了二十次罷了。」取締人力車  史渢　　甲：我有一個最新科學化的取締人力車的辦法。　　乙：倒要請教。　　甲：報上不是載有一輛十輪大卡車在凓陽路上連着撞壞人力車十餘輛，撞傷人力車夫十餘人的消息嗎？多開幾輛十輪卡車幾天一來，不就解決了嗎。長壽的人：紐約州紐布地方馬克爾太太，年一〇二歲，與其年僅二歲之重孫女合影。二人年紀相差適為一世紀連環漫畫　三毛從軍記　（九〇）  張樂平作福爾摩斯從那里來（３）  斯道哀著　郁強譯　　對於驚訝的年靑醫生們，這一切確是非常奇異的。　　坐在他的南海的起居室中吸着煙，等候着極少來的病人，年靑的柯南。道爾又聽到了他從前的良師的粗糙的聲音，對那些愛丁堡醫學院的笨拙的學生們高聲演講。有一段熟悉而常重覆的格言，也就是新偵探的本質：　　「從精密的觀察與推論中，諸位，可能得到對任何和每種病症的正確的診斷。無論如何，你們不能忽略用聽胸器和其他一切公認的和日常的方法去確定你的推論與證實你的診斷。」　　他在對約瑟夫·拜耳的記憶中，已為大偵探小說，勾好了輪廓。　　福爾摩斯問世　　歇洛克·福爾摩斯這姓名是一個靈感。有人如此空想，用任何其他的姓名來想及歇洛克·福爾摩斯，這是似是而非。這件事，很明顯的，祇供作者稍為考慮。顯然的，他的偵探不會叫「夏潑司先生」或是「法拉茲先生」；良好的鑑賞力是厭恶如此單純的一種命名。他對美國論文家福爾摩斯的愛好，——也是一位醫生——使他選定了他的姓。「我從未」他後來寫着：「如此深交和愛好一個人，而他是我從未見面過的。」但是，歇洛克的出現比較晚，從柯南道爾的舊的筆記薄中，我們看到，作者最初採用的是「歇林福特·福爾摩斯」這名字；華生則是「奧曼德·　克」。無論如何，最後終成了歇洛克·福爾摩斯，到今天還是歇洛克·福爾摩斯——近代英國小說中最熟悉的名字。這名字已成為英國語文中永恒的一部份。　　一八八〇年歲尾，或是說一八八一年初，福爾摩斯和華生碰到了，並且發覺他們當時有一個共同的需要，就是一套租金適宜設備舒適的房間，一八八一年三月四日福爾摩斯向他的同居者洩露了自己的職業。這件事記載在最先出版的「血書的研究」中（Astudy　in　Scarlet）。　　年靑的斯塔姆福特介紹了他們，隨着從故事中消失了，他的生存就此完結。次日，他們到培克街去看房子，他們住在那裏了。　　第一次的聚面，創設了故事的傳統的風格——一段對白，如同一篇序言一樣，然後故事隨而展開。華生醫生的記錄，非常簡潔：　　「華生醫生，歇洛克·福爾摩斯先生」，斯塔姆福特向我們介紹。　　「你好」！他熱誠的說，用力的緊握着我的手。「你曾在阿富汗住過，我覺察到。」　　「你怎麽會知道」？我（華生）驚訝的問。　　福爾摩斯承認他是一個私人偵探後，勞立斯頓花園的秘密（The　Louriston　Sardeno　Myatery）接踵而來。這案件完全發生在早晨——「是一個雲霧的早晨，一層黃褐色的幕　在屋頂上，看起來如同是下面泥色街道的反照」。有一個名叫安諾區，屈拉保的美國克利夫蘭州的男子，在恐怖的環境中死去，地點是勞立斯頓花園三號。　　於是，傑弗遜，厚柏的奇異的案件展開了。蘇格蘭塲警局的格拉格生和拉斯屈雷德受命探訪，但是被培光街的歇洛克·福爾摩斯先生破案了。後來，由記載全部事實在日記中的他的朋友兼夥伴約翰·華生醫生發表出來。</p>

<h3>Marshall Special Envoy Climbs Mountain for Sixth Time; Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng Hasten to Meet Chairman; Request Instructions on Discussion Content of the Five-Person Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall flew to Xun at 2:30 PM on the 30th, then transferred to Guling, accompanied by National Government Adjutant Pi Zonggan. Before departing, Special Envoy Marshall met with Yu Dawei at 10:30 AM for half an hour. After Special Envoy Marshall's sixth trip to Lushan, he does not intend to stay long and will return to Nanjing in about two days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Government representatives to the Five-Person Group Meeting, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister Zhang Lisheng, flew to Xun together at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Special Envoy Marshall, accompanied by Assistant Colonel Ke Yi, followed, flying from Nanjing at 2:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall climbed Guling for the sixth time at 7:00 PM on the 30th, to spend the weekend. Mrs. Marshall brought flowers to welcome him at Little Tianchi, then they returned to No. 40 Hexi Road together. According to well-informed sources, Special Envoy Marshall's proposal to first discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee to break the deadlock is no different than testing the waters for the future of peace negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall climbed Lushan for the sixth time on the evening of the 30th. According to those close to the Special Envoy, he is very pleased that both sides have accepted his and Ambassador Stuart's joint proposal to organize a five-person meeting and reorganize the government to break the current deadlock.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The name of the Five-Person Group Meeting has now been finalized as the Informal Group Meeting, convened by Ambassador Stuart. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to Guling at 9:00 AM on the 30th to meet with Chairman Jiang, requesting instructions on the content of the discussions at the small meeting. The capital is placing great hopes on this meeting. As for the Communist Party spokesman's claim that the meeting will still have no optimistic prospects if the government does not give a concrete answer to the unconditional ceasefire and the withdrawal of the five demands, it is learned that another sensational figure from the Communist Party, Wang Bingnan, said that he has extremely optimistic views on the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 30th] Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Zhongxin, Hong Lanyou, Gu Zhengding, and Zhang Jiuru arrived in Guling at 4:15 PM on the 30th, and Chief Secretary Wu personally went to welcome them at Rigo Peak.</p>

<h3>Wu and Zhang Hold Talks in Guling; Five-Person Talks Scheduled to Begin Next Week; Hope for Harmonious Completion of Task by Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 30th] Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Hong Lanyou met with the press corps in Guling at the residence of Mr. Xiong Shihui, No. 117 Guling Middle Road, at 5:00 PM today. According to Wu and Zhang, (1) the purpose of their arrival in Guling this time is to request instructions from the Chairman on matters related to the reorganization of the National Government Committee. (2) The name of the Five-Person Meeting or Five-Person Group Meeting for discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee has not yet been determined. The organization and tasks of this meeting are clearly temporary and simple, and no other issues will be discussed. (3) The newspaper report that in addition to the 20 seats that the Kuomintang should occupy in the National Government Committee, the remaining parties and factions and non-partisan social figures each occupy four seats is not a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference. Because the various parties and factions could not obtain a reasonable distribution, non-partisan social figures requested the government to advocate on their behalf that the above-mentioned allocation should be made. (4) It is not yet known whether there will be any difficulties in future consultations, but they are determined to do their utmost with a frank and straightforward attitude and a sincere and trustworthy desire, and hope that both sides will conduct open and honest consultations and quickly complete the reorganization of the National Government Committee. (5) The expansion of the number of members of the National Government Committee in this reorganization is to broaden the foundation of the government. (6) The reorganized National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council as the highest decision-making body for national defense. (7) They very much hope that this meeting can be successfully completed in an atmosphere of harmony and tranquility in order to eliminate domestic disputes and alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling Dispatch, 30th] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng jointly met with reporters in Guling at Xiong Shihui's residence on the 30th, with an exceptionally peaceful attitude. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, was also present. Wu and Zhang announced that the five-person talks, which will begin next week, are a temporary and simple organization. The two also said: The two of us are appointed by the Chairman to participate as government representatives. The talks are composed of two representatives from the Chinese Communist Party and one representative from the United States. Whether the name is the Five-Person Meeting or the Five-Person Group Meeting, or whether there is another name, we cannot yet say for sure. The main task of the five-person talks is to seek the realization of one of the six principles in the "August 14" document, which is to expand the base of the government. The so-called expansion of the base of the government is to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, reorganize the National Government Committee to replace the current Supreme National Defense Council, and serve as the highest guiding and decision-making body for national administration. The two then looked back on the painful memories of the CCP's failure to recommend candidates for the National Government Committee on schedule after the Political Consultative Conference closed, which caused the expansion of the government base to be delayed again and again. A reporter asked: Will the current talks on the reorganization of the National Government Committee still be based on the 8.4.4.4 model? The two replied: In the past, because it was difficult to balance the number of candidates for the National Government Committee recommended by various parties, social figures came forward to mediate. If the social figures failed to mediate, there were proposals to ask the government to handle the matter fairly, and some people advocated using 8, 4, 4, 4 as the allocation standard. Whether the current negotiations will still repeat the old tune of "8, 4, 4, 4" should be subject to public discussion. The reporter also asked: Can this five-person talks achieve an agreement at the National Assembly? Answer: The government hopes so and hopes that both sides can seek the realization of expanding the government base in a friendly and harmonious manner, so that other problems can be easily solved. Asked: If someone submits issues beyond the scope of the reorganization of the National Government Committee to the five-person talks, how will it be handled? Answer: I believe everyone will consider the scope of the agenda. Question: Who will the CCP representatives be? Answer: It has not been formally announced yet, perhaps Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Dong Biwu, it is not yet known. Question: Why is the reorganization of the National Government Committee only being discussed with the CCP? Answer: The expansion of the government base could not be realized in the past only because the CCP could not pass it. Now we are coming again to pass it. Zhang Lisheng also said: I am an honest and straightforward person, and I am not good at speaking techniques. It is really not suitable for me to serve as the government representative in negotiations with the CCP. I only have to follow the principle of resolving domestic disputes by political means shown by the Chairman and reluctantly do my best.</p>
<h3>Complete List of National Assembly Delegates to Be Announced One Month Before the Meeting</h3>
<p>Hong Lanyou Arrives in Guling to Meet with the Chairman</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, said: The complete list of delegates to the National Assembly will be announced one month before the meeting (around Double Tenth Festival). The Preparatory Committee has now completed the preparation of 2,400 seats (including officials and reporters attending) in the upper and lower auditoriums of the National Assembly Hall. Delegates from various regions now hope that the government can restore domestic transportation before the National Assembly convenes so that they can conveniently visit the post-war situation along the way, but the Preparatory Committee still intends to overcome difficulties at any time to facilitate the transportation of delegates from various regions.</p>

<h3>CCP Again Attacks American Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today again vehemently attacked American policy toward China and relayed the message from Yan'an for broadcast. It is claimed that if the United States sells surplus materials from the Western Pacific to China, it will be enough to support the government in continuing the civil war for two years. If the transaction is successful, it will only demonstrate the cruelty, falsity, and imperialist nature of the American policy toward China. The CCP office in Nanjing believes that any assistance given to the government at this time, even if it is not military supplies, can "fuel" the aggressors.</p>
<h3>Many Hidden Reefs in the Future of Peace; Zhou Enlai Makes Radical Statements During Visit to Ambassador Stuart Yesterday; Says Two Prerequisites Must Be Clarified Before Group Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, visited the US Embassy at 7:30 PM on the 30th and had dinner with Ambassador Stuart, leaving at 9:30 PM. According to sources from the Communist Party delegation, Zhou's remarks to Stuart were based on the uncertain stance of Chief Secretary Wu and Minister Peng on the five demands as reported in the newspapers. He believes that two prerequisites must be clarified before this informal group meeting, that is, the Communist Party still insists that the government must guarantee an immediate ceasefire after the government is reorganized, and that the government must withdraw the five demands before negotiations can continue, and hopes that the government can give a formal reply on these two points. If a solution cannot be obtained, Zhou expressed that the future is still extremely pessimistic and emphasized that if these prerequisites cannot be met, then it is impossible to talk about reorganizing the government. At a time when the peace talks are showing a glimmer of hope, Zhou's radical statements are truly hidden reefs in the night voyage.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart had no major contacts with the outside world on the 30th.

<h3>National Army Enters Chengde; Continues to Advance and Recapture Longhua County Seat; Communist Army Retreats Toward Weichang Tianbaoshan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou Urgent Telegram, 30th] The National Army entered Chengde on the morning of the 19th and has approached Chifeng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chaoyang Dispatch, 30th] The National Army recaptured Chengde and continued to advance northwest. Today, they entered Longhua County, more than 120 li from Chengde. The Communist army retreated toward Weichang Tianbaoshan area.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] News from the Northeast says that the National Army entered Chengde yesterday (29th) at 8:00 PM. The Commanding Officer of the Second District Pacification Office will enter the city today. Officials of the Executive Headquarters are keeping silent about this news. Committee Member Zheng Jiemin declined to answer reporters' questions, saying that "the Executive Headquarters is a peace organization and does not discuss warfare." When reporters asked if the Communist side had replied to the government's memorandum requesting them to stop attacking Datong, he replied, "No." Reporters pressed, asking if the National Army's entry into Chengde was the implementation of the warning in the memorandum that the National Army would attack Chengde and other places. Zheng replied, "I am not the commander." He only said that the Executive Headquarters is extremely concerned about the Chengde Executive Group. It is reported that the group has been abandoned by the Communist army in the mountains more than a hundred li north of Chengde. Its radio station has lost contact with the Executive Headquarters for more than three or four days. The Executive Headquarters plans to send a plane to search for them and replenish radio equipment, but it does not know the location of the group, and it is uncertain whether the plane can land. Ye Jianying has agreed to inquire about the Communist army there and reply to the Executive Headquarters within 24 hours this afternoon. The Communist Party did not criticize the news of the National Army's entry into Chengde today, only saying that they had not received a telegram.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Reporters made a special visit to military authorities. According to responsible officials, the Communist army has been besieging Datong for nearly a month. Although the government has repeatedly protested to the Communist side, the Communist army's attempt to capture Datong has not diminished. Since the National Army cannot reinforce Datong, it can only use the method of besieging Wei to rescue Zhao, and advance on Chengde.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Changchun News: Commander Liao of the New Sixth Army and his headquarters left Changchun today for the defense area of southern Liaoning.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] The Northeast military authorities have formed a committee to prepare winter clothing for hundreds of thousands of troops, ordering leather merchants in various places to report their inventory and prohibiting the export of leather goods, with severe penalties for violators.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A dispatch from North China stated: Communist General Lin Biao held a meeting of generals in Harbin to discuss new plans and new goals.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 30th] It is reported that a dispatch from Shenyang stated: The headquarters of Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast Communist Army, has moved from Harbin to Jiamusi, but this news has not yet been confirmed by other sources. It is rumored that there are 400,000 Communist troops in Jiamusi. It is also learned that the Northeast National Army has recovered Faku without a fight.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] In order to coordinate with the Rehe battle, the Communist army in the Far East launched an offensive in the Anshan-Haicheng area, with a force of 50,000 men, and brought more than 100 spies disguised and sneaked into Anshan, and the situation in the Far East suddenly became tense.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Civil Aviation Negotiations are Proceeding in Accordance with the Spirit of Equality and Mutual Benefit; Britain, France, the Philippines and Other Countries are Also in Negotiations with Us</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] An official of the Ministry of Communications said: The Sino-American civil aviation consultations currently underway here are proceeding entirely in accordance with the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, there are also countries such as Britain, France, and the Philippines that are currently conducting similar talks with us. Some countries are negotiating with us, even before the United States. Therefore, rumors that we will exchange aviation sovereignty with the United States for surplus materials are clearly inaccurate. According to those familiar with the transportation situation: In order to facilitate the landing of aircraft from various countries in our territory, our country will, in accordance with international practice, set up international airports in certain locations in the country. This should not be limited to the use of American aircraft landing. Moreover, according to the Unified Measures for Foreign Aircraft Flying Over National Borders, any country's aircraft flying into our territory must obtain our permission in advance. Sovereignty is still in our hands. Anyone with a little international common sense will not find it difficult to understand. As for the Sino-American civil aviation negotiations, they are still in the "exploratory stage" and are a routine matter. The two sides have talked about mutually allowing several airlines of the other side to land at certain designated locations. It is rumored that the aircraft of perhaps three American airlines will be allowed to land in our territory. As for whether General Chennault's organization is included, it is not known. According to the negotiations, the United States may help us build and improve some airport equipment. This matter is purely for the safety of American aircraft, because American long-haul passenger aircraft are often heavier than ordinary aircraft. However, after the airport is built, those who can use it are not limited to American aircraft. This point should also be particularly pointed out.</p>

<h3>Resident Committee of the Political Council Passes Resolution Calling for Peace; Urges Government to Speed Up Trial of He Dekui Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, State News Agency, 30th] The Resident Committee of the Political Council held its seventh meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Wang Yunwu, Chu Fucheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Fan Yuzui, Wu Chunwu, and Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen and others totaling twenty people attended. Thirteen proposals were passed. At today's meeting, the proposal submitted by Councilors Fan Yuzui, Luo Heng, Wu Chunwu, Xi Zhenduo, Yin Shuxian, and Wang Puquan calling on the government and the CCP to immediately stop military conflicts and resume consultations to achieve China's peaceful unification underwent nearly three hours of heated discussion before finally being passed. This proposal was raised at the group discussion meeting of the Council on the 23rd of this month and was referred to a subcommittee for review. At today's meeting, the review report submitted by the subcommittee was studied in detail. All Councilors believe that the military conflicts in various places are increasingly expanding and the situation is very serious, but the people are all praying for peace and unification. Therefore, standing in the position of the Council representing the people, they issued this sincere and painful call to the government and the Communist Party in the hope of immediately stopping the internal strife and restoring peace. The Councilors were extremely cautious in their speeches, but some Councilors believed that the content of the proposal was still too vague and advocated supplementing concrete opinions. After repeated discussions and careful revisions, it was finally resolved to pass the proposal and send it to the government and Councilor Bi Wu for transmittal to the Communist Party. In addition, the following proposals were all successfully passed. Finally, Councilor Wang Baohuan made a temporary motion stating that a month ago, this Council filed a report accusing He Dekui, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, of betraying the country, but the government has not yet replied, and He Dekui openly received reporters in Shanghai, defending his reasons for betraying the country. Wang continued: Ordinary people report traitors, and the judicial organs should still be involved, but this report filed by the Council has been more than a month, and there has been no follow-up, which is incomprehensible. It should be asked of the government for the reasons. The councilors resolved to urge the government to promptly hand over the case to the judicial organs for trial and give a reply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling Dispatch, 30th] Shao Lizi ascended Guling at 9:15 PM on the 30th. It is said that this trip is specifically to request instructions from the Chairman on the date of the Political Council.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Resolution Calling for Peace</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Resident Committee of the National Political Council, at its seventh meeting today, revised and passed the proposal submitted by Councilors Fan Yuzui and others urging the government and the CCP to immediately stop military conflicts and resume consultations to achieve China's peaceful unification. The main points are as follows: Although military conflicts have become increasingly fierce recently, the government is still determined to resolve political disputes by political means, and the Communist Party has also stated that it has no intention of overthrowing the National Government by force. Then, stopping armed conflicts, resuming peace talks, and seeking national unification have not yet reached the point of despair. We, as members of the Council, stand in the position of the people and firmly support the resolution of political disputes by political methods and should urgently make efforts for peace. The two major principles for resolving political problems, namely the nationalization of the army and political democratization, have been recognized by both the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Unless one or both parties have no sincerity to implement them, it seems that there is no reason why an agreement cannot be reached through consultations. Therefore, we call on the government and the Chinese Communist Party to immediately stop the conflict, resume consultations, and in the discussion of the reorganization and unified organization of the army, in addition to solving the problem according to the military reorganization plan, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will respect national unity and eliminate future troubles. Regarding the reorganization of the government and the National Assembly and local political power issues, in addition to following the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, we also hope that the government will respect the opinions of the people and strive for political renewal. Regarding the restoration of national transportation and the cessation of comprehensive conflicts, they should be carried out simultaneously without regard to urgency. The reorganization of the government and the unified organization of the army should also be implemented simultaneously without regard to priority. We are humble representatives of the people and believe that China must not engage in internal strife again after the eight-year War of Resistance. If unfortunately the war is prolonged and expanded, in addition to leading the country and the nation to eternal disaster, no party will have any results or other significance. We feel in our hearts that it is dangerous and have no choice but to make this sincere and painful call to the government and the Chinese Communist Party, urging them to immediately stop the conflict and restore peace to comfort the people of the whole country.

<h3>Statement by Yang Ge, Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, on China's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>Military Expenditure Must Be Cut to Concentrate Resources; Peace and Work Are What the People Need Most</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The Secretariat of the Central Bank announced yesterday: Dr. Yang Ge, an American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, will return to the United States on the General Hughes in the coming days and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>I have served as a financial advisor to the Chinese government for over seventeen years. Now, due to physical exhaustion, I must leave and return home for a long period of rest. Looking back on the past, I am filled with attachment.</p>
<p>China's current severe difficulties are the result of eight years of bitter war, as everyone knows. To judge the situation of the past month, we must consider the impact of eight years of war and destruction on finance, economy, and morale. During these eight years, production has sharply declined, transportation has been destroyed, public and private institutions have been devastated, and shipping losses are over 90%. Railway transportation has been largely destroyed, and famines and floods have caused widespread damage.</p>
<p>However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, China has made considerable progress. Import trade has almost fully recovered, and export trade and overseas remittances are also increasing day by day. After a good harvest, the famine and disasters in the country can be largely alleviated. Industrial production is gradually increasing, shipping losses are being rapidly replenished, and land transportation is also gradually improving.</p>
<p>In the financial sector, prices have become more stable than before, and exchange rates and gold prices have remained stable, reaching a considerable level of effectiveness. The deficit in government revenue and expenditure has gradually decreased since the spring of this year, and revenue is also increasing. The rate of issuance of currency has decreased. Although inflation has not been completely stopped, its extent is much lighter than generally imagined. Compared to the inflation during and after the First and Second World Wars in various countries, China's inflation situation cannot be called severe.</p>
<p>However, serious problems still exist. The most important issue at present is that the long-suffering Chinese people need peace and work and the opportunity to live. Without peace, there is little opportunity to obtain rest and economic progress. Unfortunately, due to the failure of peace to arrive, China's international position, won in the heroic resistance against Japan, will not be able to be consolidated quickly.</p>
<p>The most fundamental economic and financial problem at present is the reduction of military expenditure. The millions of unproductive troops are consuming the majority of China's surplus production. Therefore, the key to China's economic progress lies in finding ways to reduce the military. Only in this way can resources be concentrated for economic construction, because China does not have sufficient surplus production to simultaneously maintain a large military and engage in economic construction.</p>
<p>To seek progress in China's economy and finance, the first step must be to strive for financial stability and reduce all postponable expenditures as much as possible. On the revenue side, it is still necessary to restore sources of revenue. During this transitional period, China is fortunate to have a large amount of foreign currency assets existing abroad and domestic enemy and puppet assets. In addition, there is UNRRA assistance and foreign loans. The imbalances accumulated over the past nine years cannot be corrected suddenly. However, during the period when these special resources can still be used at any time, efforts must be made to restore economic equilibrium.</p>
<p>I am very honored to have participated in the work of the Chinese government during the decade of China's economic progress before the war, and to have personally experienced China's arduous War of Resistance and the initial stage of post-war construction. I am especially grateful to President Chiang, President Song, Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Minister Yu, President Bei, and all the others for their relationship with me. I sincerely wish the Chinese people and their leaders to overcome difficulties and advance to complete the great task of national construction.</p>
<h3>Ding Chao-wu and Others Report on UNRRA's Work in Fujian</h3>
<p>The Allegations of Corruption Against Lin Rongsen Were a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Ding Chao-wu, Speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly and Chairman of the Fujian Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Review Committee, and Zhu Daijie, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Construction, recently arrived in Shanghai from Fuzhou. Yesterday afternoon, they jointly hosted reporters to report on UNRRA's work in Fujian. The main points are three:</p>
<p>(1) The recent reports of corruption involving Lin Rongsen, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Fujian-Zhejiang Branch, have attracted attention from all sides. It was found that this case was actually due to a misunderstanding. Lin, as an engineer who entered politics, did not complete the final procedures properly, which led to criticism from outsiders. After detailed investigation and review, the misunderstanding was cleared up, and the relief work in the area can proceed smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Fujian Province suffered widespread destruction during the war. The Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway is a vital transportation artery. During the war, it was ordered to be completely destroyed. It is now planned to be repaired urgently. The road passes through ten counties and is 300 *li* long. It was built by overseas Chinese before the war. After the destruction, it became paddy fields. Now, UNRRA engineers are planning to rebuild it using mechanical road construction methods. In addition to the cost of machinery and equipment, it still requires 2.7 billion yuan. This time, they came to Shanghai to discuss it with Director-General Chiang, and it has been planned to start construction, which will take approximately four to six months to complete.</p>
<p>(3) The people of Fujian Province made great contributions during the war. The coastal areas suffered severe damage. There are now 12 million people in urgent need of relief, with medicine (due to the prevalence of plague) and agricultural water conservancy equipment being the most urgent. In addition to reporting to Director-General Chiang, this trip also discussed expanding the relief work in the Zhejiang-Fujian area. Ding and Zhu are scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow and will return to Fujian in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Assets in Wuhan Valued at 30 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 30th] Regarding the handling of enemy and puppet assets received in the Wuhan area, according to sources in charge, the total value of the assets is approximately 30 billion yuan. Over 6 billion yuan has been obtained through auctions and deposited into the treasury. Among them, daily necessities auctioned by the Jianghan Customs amounted to approximately 3 billion yuan, and industrial and mining equipment auctioned by the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs amounted to over 2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Another Private Residence of Liu Naiyi, Involved in Embezzlement Case in Tianjin, Is Discovered</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 29th] The Liu Naiyi case continues to develop. On the 29th, another private residence of Liu was discovered, which is the fourth one. However, the items have been moved away, leaving only heavy furniture inside. Liu was transferred to Ping in the morning of the 29th. (Another dispatch) Wang Xijun, Director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau, has been implicated in the case of Zhang Xiaochun, Director of the Transportation Department of the bureau, who was found to have embezzled 200 million yuan, and was arrested by the court on the 29th.</p>

He said at a tea party hosted by the Beiping press circles today: He wants to have a long conversation with the three members of the Military Mediation Team on "One World" and make a recording to take back to the United States for broadcast to Americans and the world.

<h3>Ma Lianliang Granted Bail; Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office Interrogated Him Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Ma Lianliang was interrogated by the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Ma, dressed in a costume similar to Hong Yangdong, wearing a straw hat and holding a cane, was supported by his son Chongyi into the court. Because Wang Yitang was also scheduled for a public trial on the morning of the 30th, the audience was crowded, which startled him. He took a detour to enter the court. After entering the court, Prosecutor Sun Xianxi interrogated him in detail about his performance in the puppet regime. After the interrogation, Ma repeatedly requested bail on the grounds of heart disease and was granted bail with a written guarantee of 50 million yuan and three joint guarantors, who were required to be available upon call. It is confirmed that Ma Lianliang will be "treated leniently" because a certain important person is strongly pleading on his behalf.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 30th] The major traitor Wang Yitang was originally scheduled for a public trial on the 30th. However, the court suddenly announced a postponement, and those who went to observe the trial were disappointed.</p>
<h3>Death Sentence for Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi Submitted to the Chairman for Final Decision; Chief Judge Shi Said Execution Will Be Carried Out Upon Approval</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 30th] Japanese war criminal Sakai Takashi was sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on August 27. Our reporter stationed in Suzhou visited Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Major General, at around 2:00 PM on the 30th. Shi showed the original copy of the judgment and informed that the legal articles on which the death sentence was based were the Paris Pact, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare, the Geneva Convention, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. It has now been submitted to Chairman Chiang for final decision. Once approved, the execution will be carried out, and it is expected that the chief demon who invaded China will be brought to justice within ten days at most. Shi continued: The Military Tribunal will expand its organization, and the chief judge will be a lieutenant general. He himself has submitted his resignation due to the heavy workload of the Suzhou High Court, but the authorities have repeatedly asked him to stay, and he may continue to hold the position. Shi solemnly told the reporter: Before Sakai Takashi was tried, the British Embassy had repeatedly requested to hand him over to the British authorities to be tried under British law as a war criminal in Hong Kong. However, he believed that Sakai Takashi was one of the main culprits in the invasion of China, and his crimes were more serious than those in Hong Kong, so he did not agree to the transfer. As a result, the British authorities provided evidence, and our Military Tribunal handled the case jointly. Therefore, Sakai Takashi is truly an international war criminal.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Judgment</h3>
<p>The original text of the judgment is copied below:</p>
<p>Main text Sakai Takashi participated in the war of aggression, massacred prisoners, wounded soldiers, and non-combatants, and raped, robbed, exiled civilians, abused torture, and destroyed property. He is sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Facts Sakai Takashi graduated from the Japanese Army University and was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant general, being a young and promising officer in the Japanese army. Since being ordered to come to China, he has successively served as the infantry captain and chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison, commander of the 28th Infantry Brigade, attached to the headquarters of the Mongolian Garrison, chief of the Liaison Department of the Xingya Yuan in Zhangjiakou, and commander of the 23rd Army stationed in Guangdong. He has been in China for over 20 years and is familiar with China's national conditions. He, Doihara Kenji, and Umezu Yoshijiro are the main figures who came to China to implement Japan's aggressive policy. After the September 18 Incident, he instigated traitors such as Li Jichun in North China to organize plainclothes teams to disrupt Tianjin and Beiping and incited party members in the Japanese concession in Tianjin to assassinate important party and government officials. Among those assassinated were Li Mingyue, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and Zhu Xiaofu, a reporter stationed in Tianjin for Shen Bao. In February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he again conspired to assassinate General Ma Zhanshan and former Hebei Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong in the British concession in Tianjin. In May of the same year, on the pretext of the assassination of Han traitor reporters Bai and Hu Shi , he threatened Tianjin and Beiping with artillery and air force, forcing our military and political authorities to dismiss Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and Zhang Ting , Mayor of Tianjin, to withdraw the Hebei garrison, and advocated that the five provinces of North China should secede from the central government and exercise independent political power. Later, while serving as the commander of the 23rd Army of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in South China, he ordered his subordinates Yazaki to support the puppet regime, organize the Peace Preservation Army, and increase the power of the Nanjing puppet organization in order to achieve his conspiracy to subvert our country's government. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, he has followed the Doihara Kenji Division, serving as the commander of the 28th Infantry Brigade, and led his troops to China, landing first in Tanggu and then fighting in Xuzhou, Guangdong, and other places. He repeatedly violated international laws of war, recklessly committed atrocities, and caused countless deaths and injuries wherever his iron hoofs went.

<h3>Local News Exemption from Owed Taxes in Counties Infested by Enemy Bandits Approved by Zhejiang Provincial Grain Office</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly previously requested the Grain Department to ask the Ministry of Food to exempt people in counties that had been occupied or infested by enemy bandits from paying the old land tax owed before the 33rd year of the Republic of China, and to request a one-year reduction or recovery of the old debts in the rear counties. After Director Chen Yi Jinjing repeatedly requested Minister Xu , the exemption from payment was approved for counties that had been occupied or infested by enemy bandits. The old debts in the rear counties should be fully collected, but if the people cannot pay in kind, they are allowed to pay in legal tender. In addition, regarding the reduction of the land tax levy rate, the central government, mindful of the people's hardships, has approved Zhejiang Province to reduce the borrowing levy from five dou per dou to one dou, and the county-level public grain levied with it from one dou to nine sheng, so the total levy rate can be reduced to six sheng per yuan.</p>

The preliminary work has now been completed, and according to the agreement made by the two counties in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the area south of Shadutang is under the jurisdiction of this county, while Sujia Wood Bridge and other places are under the jurisdiction of Tongxiang County, and the Tongxiang County authorities have agreed. The handover procedures can be carried out once approved by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the National Government and the Veto Power</h3>
<p>In recent days, there seems to be a glimmer of hope for peace in the Chinese political situation. The five-person committee to discuss the reorganization of the National Government is about to be formed, and government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng and Marshal Ma flew to Lushan yesterday to discuss it. Whether this glimmer of hope can open up completely depends on the sincerity of the CCP.</p>
<p>Since President Chiang issued the historically significant proclamation in Lushan, it has shown that although the CCP's style remains unchanged, the government, out of love for the people, still advocates that political issues should be resolved by political means. Therefore, the path of negotiation has not been cut off, and the hope for peace remains strong. At this time, the two envoys Ma and Si disregarded their old age and the sweltering heat, shuttled between Nanjing and Guling, and mediated. After several discussions, we finally saw a decision on the selection of candidates for the small committee on the reorganization of the National Government. According to reports, the task of this five-person committee is limited to discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee and does not involve military issues or the Executive Yuan and other issues. However, it can give the people a new excitement, because if the reorganization of the National Government Committee can be completed, then all other issues can be "discussed in conference" in this policy-making body and decided calmly, without having to be decided on the battlefield. This is a cause for celebration. It is a pity that the Communist Party again claims that this move may be a smokescreen, which shows that they still may not have any sincerity.</p>
<p>Originally, it was the consistent expectation of the current government to reorganize the National Government so that it could include people from various parties and factions other than the Kuomintang and become the highest decision-making body. Now that there is a decision on this five-person small committee, we the people hope that an agreement can be reached on the reorganization of the National Government and that it can be implemented as soon as possible. However, according to reports, the CCP stated that the agenda of the establishment of this five-person committee should be (1) the allocation of seats on the National Government Committee, and (2) the discussion on the one-third veto power. This inevitably makes us feel regret again. Because the so-called veto power is originally a procedural issue concerning the proceedings of the National Government Committee meeting, it should be a non-issue. As long as the National Government Committee is established, the committee itself can decide, and it does not need to be recorded as a serious issue and raised. However, if the discussion of "veto power" is indeed one of the main topics of the five-person committee established this time, we would like to briefly state our views when the committee is about to be established.</p>
<p>First, strictly speaking, the meaning of the term "veto power" is very ambiguous. In the US Constitution, due to the influence of the doctrine of the separation of powers and checks and balances, the president, the chief executive, can "veto" a bill passed by the legislative body, Congress. This shows the spirit of the separation of powers and balance and restraint. However, if a bill "vetoed" by the president is passed again by Congress during reconsideration, then the president cannot "veto" it again. Therefore, "veto" is originally an American system, the purpose of which is to adjust the legislative and executive branches of the government. As for the members of Congress themselves, in the proceedings, there is no so-called "veto," but only "vote." The "vote" on a bill cannot be passed into law if it does not obtain the legal quorum; but this is not a "veto." The National Government Committee is the highest decision-making body, where there is only the issue of "voting" and no so-called "veto." If we talk about "veto," only when a bill passed by the Legislative Yuan violates the supreme national policy can the National Government Committee decide by "voting" whether to "veto" or not. Strictly speaking, the National Government Committee itself should not have the issue of "veto power" in its proceedings.</p>
<p>Second, the proposal of "veto power" aims to control the majority with the minority, which is really against the spirit of democratic politics. The use of veto power proposed at the meeting is not the original meaning of "veto" power, but an act of deliberate sabotage, which is equivalent to the so-called sabotage. Why do we say this? The majority should respect the minority, and the minority must obey the majority, which is the essence of democratic politics. The use of this "veto power" allows the minority to control the majority, so that the majority cannot but accommodate the minority. If the members of a meeting are 30, and more than one-third object, they can "veto," which means that a minority of 11 people can "veto" a majority of 19 people. If this is said to be democracy, then we will see that in the future election competitions in various democratic countries, it is not necessary to strive for the status of the majority party!</p>
<p>Third, the United Nations Security Council and important international conferences, such as the Paris Peace Conference, originally also had the proposal and use of "veto power." At the Paris Peace Conference, the Soviet representative proposed a one-third veto power, and the UK also proposed a compromise plan to remedy it. In the United Nations organization, the Soviet representative was also concerned about the proposal and use of "veto power." But the United Nations organization and the Paris Peace Conference are ultimately international conferences. How can their nature be compared with that of the National Government Committee as the highest decision-making body of a country? If there is the use of veto power in the highest decision-making body of a country, then everything will be restricted. As long as one-third vetoes, nothing can be decided. Not only will the country's major plans be delayed, but in fact, if this one-third veto power is recognized, it is tantamount to being on the verge of death before the birth of the baby. If it is hoped that the reorganization of the National Government can strengthen the government's power, then the result of this system will be the opposite.</p>
<p>Our hope is that if the National Government is reorganized, the reorganized National Government Committee must be a powerful body. We should enrich the power of the National Government Committee from a positive perspective, and we should not only think from a negative perspective and use the "veto power" to restrict the power of the National Government Committee. If the CCP is sincerely willing to participate in the government on the one hand, but insists on the provision of one-third "veto power" on the other hand, we really do not know what tricks they are playing. For the sake of the nation, we once again urge the CCP to abandon its prejudices so that the power of the National Government Committee, which may be successfully reorganized, can be free from being frozen by the existence of one-third veto power.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Yihetuan and Empty Talk</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty (1900), the Yihetuan (Boxers) burned churches, killed missionaries, destroyed railways and telegraph lines, and assassinated the German minister Ketteler in the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) area. Prince Duan Zaiyi and other powerful nobles exploited them to besiege embassies, leading to the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion. The Boxer Protocol resulted in huge reparations, severely damaging the nation's vitality, and triggered the Russian occupation of the three northeastern provinces. Subsequently, disputes over troop withdrawal led to the Russo-Japanese War, and eventually the September 18th Incident, culminating in the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo—all stemming from the Yihetuan incident.</p>
<p>Currently, the Communist army in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and the nine northeastern provinces is dismantling railways, digging up sleepers, blowing up railway bridges, and destroying factories. Furthermore, they have breached dikes on the Jiangsu border and in Hebei, causing unprecedented floods. In the Anping Incident, several American soldiers were killed or injured. Recently, they have been expelling and oppressing missionaries in various parts of Shandong and Shanxi, and the list goes on. A few political factions are also echoing them. Ceasefire keeps being postponed, and problems regarding road repair, troop stationing, and reorganization have long remained unresolved. If this drags on, it will inevitably lead to a prolonged civil war, and may even trigger a third world war.</p>
<p>The Yihetuan's slogan was "Support the Qing, Destroy the Foreign," and their belief was in the White Lotus sect. The Communist Party's slogan is "New Democracy," and their belief is in Marxism. One sought to kill all foreigners, while the other obeys the orders of a certain foreign country and excludes other foreign countries, but the result is the same: suffering for the Chinese people. The old and weak perish in the ditches, and the strong scatter in all directions, as can be seen from the refugees from northern Jiangsu in the Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai areas.</p>
<p>During the Jin Dynasty, there was a group of scholar-officials who revered Lao-Zhuang philosophy and scorned ritual propriety, spending their days engaging in "empty talk," oblivious to the state of the nation. Today, there is KMT-CCP negotiation, and negotiation among various parties. From the issuance of the ceasefire order on January 10th of this year to the present, negotiation after negotiation, talks after talks, more than half a year has passed, yet no resolution has been reached. In the Jin Dynasty, "empty talk" was accompanied by whisk waving; today's negotiations are accompanied by airplanes. The result, as of today, is that the negotiations are no different from the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty—mere verbiage, of no benefit to the country. Historians say that the Jin Dynasty fell due to "empty talk." Future historians may say that the demise of the Republic of China was due to negotiation!</p>
<p>In reality, although the Yihetuan was a reckless and violent uprising, it was limited to a few powerful nobles and ignorant commoners. In the Qing court, there were attacks from figures such as Yuan Chang and Xu Jingcheng; in the localities, there was the mutual protection of the southeastern governors. Right and wrong were clearly defined. Therefore, the Yihetuan incident could have led to national destruction but did not. The situation today is different. Within its occupied areas, the CCP vigorously implements its so-called land policy, issues its own currency, and prints its own postage stamps, acting like an independent nation. Roads are destroyed, dikes are breached, people are killed, and factories are ruined, yet the government still negotiates with them, and society has not voiced a strong opinion. The "liberated areas" and the disaster areas, internal war and internal chaos, are forever indistinguishable. The nation has lost all sense of right and wrong. The severity of the situation today is even greater than during the Yihetuan era.</p>
<p>Although some have blamed the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty for national ruin, historical examination reveals that this "empty talk," limited to figures such as He Yan and Wang Bi, fostered a decadent atmosphere. While it did not benefit the country, it also did not harm it; while it did not benefit the people, it also did not harm them. Today's negotiations are different. With each passing day of delay, millions across the country are injured or killed, millions are displaced, countless factories and railways are destroyed, and countless properties and materials are lost. Therefore, today's insincere negotiations are even more harmful to the nation and the people than the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>Currently, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have issued a joint statement warning that mediation is on the verge of failure, while Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the compatriots on the 14th, still stating that the nation's future remains bright and promising, and that no obstacle can hinder our restoration. The people are bewildered and pessimistic, yet the government still believes that the disputes can be resolved through "political means." Of course, we ordinary people are happy to listen, but how long must we wait for a resolution? I believe that for the sake of the government, the most important thing is to clarify politics, improve efficiency, and resolutely and swiftly re-examine all cases of traitors and corruption, without any indulgence or leniency. If the government can truly achieve integrity and incorruptibility in politics, then the lost hearts of the people can gradually be won back. Then, with a spirit of impartiality, implement policies that save the people from fire and water, convene the National Assembly, and promulgate the Constitution. The effect will be as Mencius said, "The people will flock to them like water flowing downwards, irresistibly." Victory is nearly a year past, I respectfully offer this to the government.

<p>According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 29th, order continues to deteriorate within Greece. According to a government bulletin, one person was killed, eight were injured, and 19 were arrested. Disturbances have occurred throughout the country. Minister of Public Security Leodokis stated that the government is studying methods to restore law and order.</p>
<p>Another report from Paris on the 30th, quoting Athens, states that terrorists under the direction of Bulgaria have repeatedly attacked Greek gendarmes, causing many deaths and injuries. Near Chalcis, a gendarmerie vehicle was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of three gendarmes and the kidnapping of two. A similar ambush occurred in Larissa, where 11 soldiers were killed.

According to a Greek newspaper, King George of Greece will thank King Farouk of Egypt for his hospitality before returning to Athens on a British warship.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Athens, Greek authorities banned the left-wing EAM party from holding a meeting in a theater on the night of the 29th, but at the same time, 100,000 royalists held a demonstration in Constitution Square in Athens, supporting the return of the King, and reading a message from the royalist leader, Prime Minister Tsaldaris.</p>
<h3>Ups and Downs in the Security Council; Soviet Union Proposes That All Countries Report on the Deployment of Troops Abroad; Mongolia's Application for Membership Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press International, Lake Success, New York, 29th] At today's Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union made a surprising proposal that all United Nations members submit a detailed report to the Security Council within two weeks regarding the number and location of their troops stationed abroad as of August 1, excluding those stationed in the territories of former enemy states. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, made this proposal immediately after the vote on the new membership issue, disregarding the General Assembly's rules of procedure by not submitting the proposal in writing for inclusion on the agenda. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative, was greatly angered and vehemently opposed it. The chairman, Polish representative Lange, also believed that Gromyko's proposal did not comply with the rules of procedure and declared that it need not be discussed until it was formally included on the agenda.</p>
<p>Gromyko's proposal called for all United Nations members to submit reports to the Security Council within two weeks on the following two matters: (1) the number and distribution of their troops stationed abroad (excluding former enemy states), and (2) the situation of naval and air bases in each area, and the scope of the defense zones. Gromyko attacked the fact that "the war has been over for a long time, but Allied troops are still stationed in the territories of other countries, and not for operational needs." He claimed that world public opinion is paying "attention to the development of such troops with undisguised concern." It is understood that this Soviet proposal involves British troops in Greece and Egypt, as well as American troops in China and Iceland.</p>
<h3>Membership Applications; Final Voting Results; Only Three Countries Pass</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] The Security Council continued its meeting on the 29th to discuss the membership applications of eight countries. Heated debates ensued, lasting for eight hours. Both the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union used their veto power. In the end, only Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden were approved, while the rest were rejected. According to United Nations regulations, a country's application for membership must be approved by seven votes in the Security Council (i.e., two-thirds), and all five permanent members of the Security Council (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France) must vote in favor. The results of today's votes are as follows:</p>
<p>"Albania": Votes in favor: Soviet Union, Brazil, France, Mexico, Poland. Votes against: United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands. Abstentions: Australia, China, Egypt. "Outer Mongolia": Votes in favor: Soviet Union, Brazil, Mexico, China, France, Poland. Votes against: United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands. "Afghanistan": All voted in favor except Australia, which did not vote. "Transjordan": Eight countries voted in favor, but the Soviet Union and Poland voted against. "Southern Ireland": Nine countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power, and Australia did not vote. "Portugal": Eight countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union and Poland voted against, and Australia abstained. "Iceland": All voted in favor, except Australia, which abstained. "Sweden": All voted in favor, except Australia, which abstained.</p>
<p>Australia's representative did not vote this time, abstaining in all cases, because he argued that the application process should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly first, and then transferred to the Security Council for comments.</p>

<h3>Results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting; Agreed on Procedures for Handling Treaties and Amendments; Unagreed Portions Can Be Voted on Freely</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press International, Paris, 29th] At the first meeting of the four foreign ministers since the opening of the Paris Peace Conference, procedures were agreed upon on the 29th for handling draft treaties and approximately 300 amendments in the various committees of the conference. According to the French side, the four foreign ministers reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining the agreed-upon portions of the drafts, opposing amendments from the seventeen nations, but at the same time agreed to examine all amendments and support those that are mutually acceptable in the committees. Regarding amendments that the four powers cannot accept, the foreign ministers have the right to vote against their passage.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers' meeting also discussed Foreign Minister Molotov's request to postpone the United Nations General Assembly until the end of December or early January of next year, but no agreement was reached. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin opposed this proposal, saying that the United Nations General Assembly could convene as scheduled on September 23.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers' meeting drafted a joint statement regarding the resolution on handling amendments, which also stipulated that the four powers could freely vote on portions of the treaty on which they had not yet agreed. The foreign ministers' meeting instructed the representatives of the four countries to begin reviewing the amendments proposed by the other seventeen countries this Friday, in accordance with the joint statement. The meeting was then adjourned and is expected to reconvene next Monday.</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative Speaks at the Peace Conference Plenary Session, Opposing the Continued Stationing of British Troops in Greece; Greek-Albanian Dispute to Be Discussed at the Next General Assembly; Iranian Representative Attended Yesterday to State His Views</h3>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The Peace Conference held a plenary session today, chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie. First, the proposal by the Iranian government to request to present its views to the conference was discussed and unanimously approved without objection. The Iranian representative then recounted the country's contributions to the country's claims. Then, the proposal by Greece to include the Greek-Albanian border dispute in the Peace Conference agenda was discussed. Soviet Representative Molotov took the lead in opposing it, strongly criticizing the current Greek regime as a regime of terror and arguing that the continued stationing of British troops in Greece would lead to permanent chaos in the Balkans. Molotov said that Greece wanted to restore the monarchy under the guise of a referendum and disrupt the security of the Balkans. Ukraine has filed a complaint with the Security Council, and now Greece wants to divert attention and create a smokescreen at the Peace Conference. The Soviet delegation refused to use the Peace Conference as a cover for the regime of terror and refused to allow British troops to remain in Greece, causing permanent chaos in the Balkans. He asked the conference to reject the Greek proposal and asked the Greek representatives to adopt ordinary diplomatic methods to resolve their dispute with Albania.

<h3>Severe Grain Shortage: Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 28th</h3>
<p>How to solve the grain shortage is currently the central topic of Japan's economic problems. Production difficulties and increased crime are all caused by the food shortage. According to a survey by the House of Representatives' Food Countermeasures Committee, crimes related to food account for 76% of all cases investigated nationwide. Due to the food shortage, there has been a tendency for labor force reduction in some production sectors. According to a report in the Mainichi Shimbun on August 21, frequent labor disputes in various textile factories due to the deteriorating food situation have greatly reduced productivity. Japan's food supply has never been self-sufficient in normal times, relying heavily on imports from Taiwan and Korea. From Showa 8 to Showa 12 (1935), the annual imports from Taiwan and Korea were 12.83 million koku (6.6 koku equals one ton). After Showa 14, Korea experienced a drought, and the consumption of rice in Korea and Taiwan themselves greatly increased after the Sino-Japanese War. The amount exported to Japan sharply decreased to 6 million koku in Showa 18. Before the Pacific War, 8 to 10 million koku of foreign rice were imported from Vietnam, Siam, and Burma. However, after the Pacific War, the number of Japanese ships decreased, and the import of foreign rice was almost completely cut off. Therefore, Japan had to rely on the import of miscellaneous grains from Manchuria, but this also gradually decreased due to insufficient ships and the unfavorable war situation. Therefore, Japan had to make wheat and potatoes the main food source in addition to rice, the main staple, while also increasing the consumption of early rice. At the same time, the supply of eggs also decreased sharply. Therefore, from Showa 16 onwards, a quantitative distribution was implemented for general consumers, while restricting the use of rice for sake production. At the time of implementing grain distribution, only 2.3 go (合勺, a Japanese unit of volume) were allotted. After Showa 17, miscellaneous grains were mixed in, and in July Showa [unclear character, likely 19], the ration was reduced by another 10%. The current ration in Tokyo is only 2.1 go. The food problem was most serious in April, May, and June of this year, with almost no rations distributed. Fortunately, General MacArthur imported a large amount of flour and canned goods from the United States and distributed them to the Japanese people, which slightly alleviated the grain shortage. However, whether Japan will still be threatened by a grain shortage in 1947 is still the most concerning issue for the Japanese people. This year, due to the higher temperature, the expected rice production is higher than in previous years, but the artificial assistance is still insufficient. Furthermore, due to typhoons and floods, the rice production for this year (1947) is expected to be 55 million koku. This figure is still far from the actual needs, and miscellaneous grains must be used. Last April, the national population survey in Japan was 74 million. If the number of repatriated Japanese is added, the total population will reach 78.2 million. If the annual rice production is 68.2 million koku, then the per capita ration will be 0.91 koku per year, and the daily ration will be 0.0025 koku (2.5 go). This ration is still 20% less than the pre-war average consumption of 1.1 koku per person, and this ration also includes potatoes, which have a lower caloric value. Under these circumstances, the Japanese food supply will still be insufficient without foreign rice imports. Considering the current starvation-level rations, the general Japanese people cannot maintain a certain amount of calories. Urban residents must go to the countryside to buy food, creating a black market and promoting the rise in food prices. This not only affects the production of important products, but also causes wages to fluctuate with the rise in food prices, which only adds fuel to the fire of inflation. The currently distributed portion only accounts for 30% of the total food holdings. 70% of Japan's food sources depend on the black market. In cities, ordinary people sell furniture, clothing, and all daily necessities in exchange for food, creating an informal economic boom in rural areas, where agricultural product prices are higher than industrial products; in other words, higher than the prices of daily necessities. This is due to the poor current ration system and the unfairness of the farmers' rice delivery system. Of course, the only way to solve the grain shortage is to expand the cultivated area. Japan has a large amount of land suitable for cultivation that has not yet been reclaimed. However, according to the opinions of scholars' several inspections, it would take 65 years to convert all this land into cultivated land. Japan's agricultural production capacity has not reached the world's production level, and a large amount of fertilizer is needed. The amount of harvest obtained from one day's labor per person is only one to (斗, a Chinese unit of volume) of wheat (Japanese to), while American farmers can obtain this amount in a few minutes. Therefore, in addition to expanding the cultivated area, the method to solve Japan's grain shortage is to improve agricultural production capacity, but these methods are not easy tasks. At present, the only way is to rely on foreign imports. Even livestock feed cannot be self-sufficient and must rely on imports. The American side believes that the world grain shortage can be overcome, and Japan can import more food from abroad, advocating increasing silk production to export abroad in exchange for food. Lieutenant Colonel Bwal, head of the Production Group of the MacArthur Resources Department, made a speech at the Nagoya Silk Industry Association, advocating this view. In summary, although Japan's food problem has not been fundamentally solved, it has been eased compared to before due to American aid and the good harvest this year. The harvesting of early rice has already started. It is reported that the harvest in Yamagata Prefecture, a northern production area, has doubled compared to last year. Agriculture and Forestry Minister Wada stated at the House of Representatives' Food Measures Law Committee on the 21st that the current ration will be appropriately increased after the new rice comes on the market in November this year. The Food Management National Federation has requested that the current ration be increased to 2.8 go. The black market price has also gradually decreased recently. Therefore, the general conclusion is that the Japanese people can overcome the current food crisis.</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang and his Wife Deliver Speeches One After Another at the Women's Circle Farewell Party, Politeness Brings Laughter Throughout the Audience</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Women's Circle held a farewell party yesterday for Feng Yuxiang and his wife at the YMCA. Deng Yingchao, the chairwoman, introduced Feng, saying that the success of Yu the Great in controlling the floods was due to his ability to understand the nature of the water. He then used the method of water control to govern, achieving great success. Feng has always been able to understand the people's opinions, and if he uses this to investigate water conservancy, he will surely achieve the same success as Yu the Great. She then invited Feng to speak, but unexpectedly, Feng smiled and insisted that Mrs. Feng speak first. The two humbly yielded to each other for a long time, causing laughter throughout the audience. As a result, the chairwoman said, "Today is a gathering of women, so we respect men, so please Mr. Feng speak first." Feng then began by saying that he was very happy to come to Shanghai this time. Recalling the Battle of Shanghai, which began on August 13th, he was ordered in Nanjing on August 14th to be the commander of the Third War Zone, which was responsible for directing the fighting in Shanghai. On August 15th, he set up a headquarters on a mountain near Suzhou, and on August 16th, he went to the front to discuss strategy with senior generals. At that time, gentlemen such as Zhang Yili and Li Genyuan from Shanghai came to the front to comfort the troops. The generals gathered included Zhang Fakui, Zhang Zhizhong, Yang Hu, Chen Cheng, and Gu Zhutong. The war situation was extremely tragic. Often, three divisions would go up, and only two or three hundred people would come down, and they would be limping and missing arms. Although I dare not say "we fought well," when our army died two or thirty men, the Japanese army would also die two or three men. Millions of soldiers have exchanged for hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers. I am mentioning this battle now because I feel very sorry for the people of Shanghai, for the elders, brothers, and sisters of Shanghai, because our army ultimately had to retreat, abandoning the people of Shanghai behind us, resulting in them being subjected to the trampling of the Japanese. Thinking of this today, I still feel ashamed of my duty and deeply guilty. During the eight years, fortunately, with the assistance of the Allied countries, we achieved victory. Today, I have come back and first want to confess my sins to the people and ask for their forgiveness. This time, I was ordered to investigate water conservancy, which I find very pleasant, because if water conservancy is done well, everyone will have work to do, and everything will be solved. As for my position, it is very [unclear character] clear. On November 1st, I was invited by President Chiang to Nanjing. Old friends such as Zhan Liming came to greet me and told me that there was a major news story that day, which was that Wang Jingwei was shot three times at the [unclear characters] Central Committee meeting that afternoon. My position has always been to stand on the position of the Three Principles of the People during the War of Resistance, unite all parties and factions, support the government, support President Chiang, and resolutely resist the war. After the victory, I still hold the same position, uniting all parties and factions, supporting the government, supporting President Chiang, and working hard to build the country. I only wish for peace in the country and do not desire to be promoted or get rich. Then, Mrs. Feng spoke, briefly describing her experience of leaving Shanghai in August, going to Beiping, then to Xi'an, and then returning to Shanghai. She expressed great respect for the principal of Peiman Girls' High School for being loyal to the country and engaging in education during the enemy-puppet period, and was also very concerned about the establishment of nurseries in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Puppet Nanjing Mayor Zhou Xuechang Conceals Assets, Exposed</h3>
<p>His Estranged Wife Requests a Reward, Petitions Investigation Team to Conduct Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing, was arrested in Nanjing after the victory. His first wife, Yan Zhonglu, recently submitted a document to the investigation team, accusing Zhou of concealing assets under an assumed name. It roughly stated: On July 14th and August 5th of this year, she had successively petitioned the First Inspection Team of the Control Yuan to forward a request to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to seal off the hidden traitorous assets and legally apply for a reward. She also recounted that after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, she followed Zhou to Sichuan. In 1940, Zhou secretly went to the puppet capital, betraying the party and the country, which she deeply resented. She published a notice in the newspaper to sever their marital relationship. For six years, she supported herself through labor, raising three sons and two daughters, striving for an independent personality to redeem the shame of her family. This time, she came to Shanghai from Sichuan to complete the legal formalities.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] During the Anti-Japanese War, many freshmen enrolled in colleges and universities could not obtain formal secondary school graduation certificates due to the impact of the war, and their student registration has not been approved.

The student registration of students in colleges and universities that remained open in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Beijing during the Anti-Japanese War should still be handled and reported to the ministry for record in accordance with the regulations. Transfer students and students who change from auditing students to formal students should still send the transfer certificate and transcripts issued by the original school to the ministry for verification in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>#### Fundraising Nature</p>
<p>This performance is jointly organized by the Sports Institute and the Hunan Disaster Relief Committee, with the help of the Youth Swimming Team. It is entirely of a fundraising nature, so the free tickets issued by the Sports Institute are not valid. Admission is only allowed with a badge and a 10,000 yuan ticket. Even the athletes participating in the performance, or if they bring direct relatives, must purchase tickets. In addition to dispatching large trucks to transport athletes between the Sichuan Road Youth Association and the swimming pool at the specified times (a truck from the Sichuan Road Youth Association departs at 1:00 PM), there will be no splitting of ticket fees, nor any subsidies. Only an elegant commemorative badge will be given as a spiritual reward. This plan was unanimously passed and enthusiastically supported at the New Life Club the night before last. Therefore, the athletes not only have no personal gain, but also have to pay for their own transportation. In addition to donating manpower, water, electricity, and chemical supplies, the Sports Institute will donate all of its regular income for both days to the Hunan disaster relief.</p>
<p>#### Ticket Sales Situation</p>
<p>A total of 4,000 tickets were printed, 2,000 each day, more than double the original plan. Because many benevolent people who bought tickets may not all go to the pool to watch, as of yesterday, ticket sales have been very enthusiastic. Mrs. He is taking the bus every day to promote sales, which is the most effective. The remaining tickets that can be sold at the door are only a few hundred each day. If all 2,000 people come to the swimming pool, it will definitely feel crowded. If this happens, please understand.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Problems in Improving Shanghai Secondary Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Xie En</p>
<p>Shanghai's secondary schools are progressing in terms of quantity, but compared to the speed of quantitative progress, the quality seems to be lagging behind. Secondary education has its special mission, and if it fails to fulfill its function and exert its effectiveness, even high-speed development will be in vain. If we don't talk about improving secondary education, that's fine, but if we do, I think we shouldn't only seek expansion in terms of quantity. Improving quality and promoting effectiveness should be given special attention.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of Shanghai secondary schools in the second semester of 1945, there were 19 public secondary schools and 207 private secondary schools (more in the previous semester). The number of public secondary schools accounts for less than 10% of the number of private secondary schools. In terms of grades, public secondary schools have a total of 208 senior and junior high school grades, while private secondary schools have a total of 1,355 senior and junior high school grades. The number of grades in public secondary schools accounts for only about 15% of the number of grades in private secondary schools. In terms of students, public secondary schools have a total of 7,845 senior and junior high school students, while private secondary schools have a total of 61,248 senior and junior high school students. The number of students in public secondary schools accounts for less than 13% of the number of students in private secondary schools. Judging from the history and performance of the schools, private secondary schools such as Biwen Girls' Middle School and Qingxin Middle School have been established for more than 90 years, and no public secondary school has surpassed them. As for performance, although there are no accurate figures for comparison between public and private secondary schools, the special and outstanding talents achieved by private secondary schools over the years are often above those of public secondary schools, which is also a common fact we see. Based on this, the center of gravity of Shanghai's secondary education is obviously on the private schools. Why private secondary schools have formed such a development in Shanghai, there are certainly more than one reason, but this issue is not within the scope of this article, so I will not discuss it for the time being. However, although private secondary schools occupy an important position, a detailed examination of their quality reveals that they are extremely uneven, and there seems to be much room for improvement. Now that we are talking about improving Shanghai's secondary education, it is not easy to achieve the goal if we only know how to focus our efforts on public secondary schools and do not provide real support and practical guidance to the absolutely majority of private secondary schools, adjust their steps, standardize their facilities, assist their material construction, and improve the level of their teachers. In other words, education has no public or private distinction. The difference between public and private schools is only the source of funding is slightly different. They are both responsible for training useful young people for the country and society. The country and society cannot treat young people differently, and the country and society should naturally not discriminate against the secondary education that young people receive. Education is holistic, and youth education is also indivisible. When the government does not have the power and it is not necessary to take over all private secondary schools, it seems that it should concentrate its efforts on supporting and enriching private secondary schools, which is the most urgent task to improve today's secondary education, allowing it in Shanghai where private secondary schools have reached an extreme degree of development. My meaning is that, unless there is a special need, it seems that it is not necessary to add a large number of public secondary schools for the time being. The already-run public secondary schools must first enrich their content, improve their quality, and make them models for secondary education, just like the central national schools in national education, and earnestly undertake the work of demonstrating, connecting, researching, and guiding private secondary schools. If there is an increase in secondary education funding in the future, since no new public secondary schools will be created, it can be transferred to subsidize the development of private secondary schools, so that all private secondary schools can reach the standard on the horizontal line in terms of material equipment or educational effectiveness. It is the most economical and most effective way to use the funds to run a public secondary school to improve the facilities of several private secondary schools.</p>

<h3>Shuangma 1.4 Million, Factories Ship Goods in Red-Hot Market, Approved Six Thousand Hundreds of Pieces, Spinning and Construction Listing Yesterday Still Maintained Original Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The centralized fair-price distribution of yarn from private cotton mills, which has been clamoring for a long time, started yesterday evening with a red-hot market of 1.4 million for Shuangma standard. Other brands were reduced according to grade. The factory numbers and customer groups applied to the yarn mills and were approved for distribution by the association, reaching a huge number of six thousand hundreds of pieces. The Guangbang consumption was still not weak. Before the market opened, the atmosphere in the yarn market was muddled all day. When it opened in the evening, there was no significant stimulation. Because Spinning and Construction also opened yarn yesterday, the listing did not move. And the former Shuangma factory price had already reached more than 1.3 million. Although the black market had reached as high as 1.67 million, many knowledgeable people in the industry predicted that this fair price would not exceed 1.4 million. The opening of the market was decided under the agreement of the committee jointly formed by the representatives of the private yarn mills at the Spinning and Construction Ministry of Economic Affairs Special Commissioner's Office. The measures were quite thorough. However, the goods are futures, and the packaging is new packaging of 400 pounds. The practical factories and actual sales customers ultimately feel unsatisfied. Yesterday, some yarn mills stopped collecting orders in advance, which shows that the yarn mills have sacrifices to make. Wu Weijing, the person in charge of Spinning and Construction, expressed his determination to arouse sympathy and hoped that the factory numbers and customer groups who received the distribution could cooperate. He also said that the amount of goods distributed would not be forced and limited, but the time of delivery would depend on the actual situation of each factory. The implication is that there is still "flexibility." According to observers, if there is no concrete method for the regular distribution of futures, the number of applicants will decrease when the second batch of goods is distributed, and those who open goods to Spinning and Construction will still be crowded. Other factories such as Chongxin's Dafa and Tongyi's Golden Rooster are said to be set at 1.4 million, the same as Shuangma. As for Shenxin No. 1 Factory's Red Bell, it is 1.36 million, No. 2 Factory's Heavenly Girl Scattering Flowers is 1.34 million, and No. 6 Factory's Double Happiness is 1.32 million. The factory numbers and customer groups are applying, and today they should be able to open and distribute according to this.</p>
<h3>Situation Suddenly Changed Before Closing, All Chinese Stocks Show High Prices</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were suppressed by hot money entering and cold money exiting, and the money market was not loose. From high to low, those who made profits at high prices settled. People's hearts are not easy to be optimistic. In the middle of the session, the stocks showed low prices. Yongsao saw 643 yuan, Meiya 3,650 yuan, Jingfu 225 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Qinxing 170 yuan. However, the cold stocks were unusually firm, so miscellaneous firms and floating funds absorbed small stocks and first added fuel. The popular large stocks showed a consolidation after falling. Near the close, there was a sudden buying trend within ten minutes. Large investors rushed to turn around, and high prices reappeared near noon. Yongsao reached 673 yuan, Meiya 4,050 yuan, Jingfu 253 yuan, Xinguang 285 yuan, and Qinxing 205 yuan.

<h3>The Street Vendors' "Last Day": The Setting Sun is Infinitely Beautiful, But It's Only Near Dusk</h3>
<p>[Our Special Report] Today is the last day for street vendors. From tomorrow onwards, the American goods street vendors, which were originally visible everywhere on the streets and roadsides, will no longer exist. The housewives of Shanghai have always been sensitive, and this time was no exception. As soon as they heard the mayor said he was determined to crack down on street vendors, they feared that they would no longer be able to buy cheap foreign goods in the future, and rushed to purchase in large quantities—on the contrary, making the street vendors' business show its final splendor.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at Zhu Bao San Road, one of the largest concentration points of American goods street vendors, people gradually became more numerous starting at nine o'clock. The short section of the road was like an open-air department store, and also like people from the countryside attending a temple fair. On the sidewalks on both sides of the road were densely packed with mobile glass display cases of various sizes, most of which were still equipped with large parasols providing shade. The road was even more crowded, with shoulder-to-shoulder buyers. The entire Zhu Bao San Road was jam-packed.</p>
<p>The goods here were also really plentiful, all radiating dazzling brilliance. Military canned foods were the most numerous. In the glass displays, if you wanted to buy something to eat, there were canned tomato soup, beef consommé, large cans of cheese, small cans of coffee extract, orange juice, and grape juice. If you wanted to buy some daily necessities, there were even more, from clothing, glass leather bags, glass wallets, glass cigarette cases, etc., to military blankets and leather shoes, truly deserving the description of "everything you need." Among them, there was even one stall selling woolen fabric, suggesting that he had a considerable amount of capital.</p>
<p>The most popular were probably canned goods and cosmetics. A young man once bought fifteen cans of tomato soup in one go. The stallholder replied, "There are no more, that's all there are here." Cosmetics also had the largest clientele, with most beauty-loving ladies buying a little bit. One woman was carrying a large travel bag, filled with Colgate toothpaste, Squibb toothpaste, face powder, etc. At the same time, she was still buying a dozen small white bottles of Pond's Cold Cream. The trade in glass leather bags was also not bad, and a certain red actress had also made a special trip to come here. Some students were buying Parker 51 fountain pens, which were still relatively cheap at a price of 70,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>The American goods street vendor market throughout the city was not limited to Zhu Bao San Road alone. Presumably, the areas around Liuhe Road, Tianzhutang Street, Henan Road, and Tianjin Road were also similarly crowded with hordes of buyers. However, after today, this last day, what will happen to them? Some vendors said, "We are changing careers, and will continue to sell these goods until they are all sold out." However, some still harbored a lucky illusion, saying, "They are still petitioning." But the vast majority have clearly understood this final helpless situation and are doing their best to "dispose of goods for cash." Just wait for tomorrow, when the mayor's determination to crack down on street vendors will be like a large broom, sweeping away these markets that dump American smuggled goods and obstruct traffic.</p>
