<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕經濟部計劃委會二日上下午分別續開第二第三次會議。上午王主委雲五主席，討論主題仍為昨日之「卅六年度經濟部施政綱領」下午蕭副主委錚主席，討論主題為「挽救工業危機」，各委員發言之無烈，一如昨日，至下午六時散會前，當由主席宣佈「挽救工業危機」一題硏討猶有未盡，定明日上午繼續討論。上午施政綱領繼續討論時，發言者一致集中於省營企業及接收敵廠處理兩大問題，前一問題曾有正反兩方面意見，一度辯論激烈，但最後僉認省營企業等運用不當，因有演成經濟割據之弊，但設以省營為手段而不以為目的，則仍有倡導推進經濟建設之功。至接收敵廠處理問題，各委員多有謂政府應以經濟觀點為重，改善目前標賣辦法，且迅速實現租賃等方式，合理分配於抗戰期閒有貢獻之各工廠。潘副主委序倫旋乃報吿渠參加蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理審議會之經騐，對處理為難情形，有所說明。下午討論「挽救工業危機」，各委員非為經濟學者即為產業界主持人物，故討論時每人心中均有異常沉重之感，自三時直至六時，僅對限制外貨進。及外匯匯率兩支目尚有未盡欲言之慨。若干委員對提倡國貨一點，尤多慨乎言之，而對限制　人，亦有具體而寶貴之建議。休會前，農林部列席代表皮作　並特別請准發言，希望各委員能兼顧當前農產品內外銷之危機，一如對工業之硏討有效對策。</p>
<p>〔又電〕經濟部負責人今日語記者，此次該部召開之經濟計劃委員會首届會議，旨在集思廣益，溝通各方意見，故會議完全採取座談方式，而一切討論亦不一定求得結論，更不作任何決議，此與一般所稱為「會議」者性質梢有不同。</p>

<h3>社論　原子彈試騐後的世界</h3>
<p>美國超級空中堡壘「台芙之夢」號，前大淸晨在比基尼島投下了這第四顆原子炸彈，全世界的人們都提心吊膽，為着世界的前途祖憂，並迫切地要知道：經這次試驗，原子彈對於海軍究有何種威力？美國人稱這次試驗為「十字街演習」意謂世界的前途不和平即毀滅，在這次試驗之後就可分曉。所以美國海陸兩軍此次的試驗，確有深長的意義，不僅這一聲爆炸的巨響將撼動整個世界，而且人類歷史上也將紀錄下來這聲巨響的回音。</p>
<p>美國舉行這一塲大試驗，準備已久。在比基尼珊瑚羣島附近海面，把大小艦艇七十餘艘，環列如城，作為原子炸彈的靶子，四面部署更加週密若網。美國為了這一塲大試驗，直接消費七千萬美元，間接開支更在五萬萬美元以上。美國雖是黃金之國，但畢竟糜費這一筆鉅款，決不會出之兒戲，恣意浪費的。其餘各國對此，也莫不異常重視，尤其是不知原子彈奧妙的國家，更加要知道這次試驗的結果。所以前往參觀試驗的，有各國的政治家。外交家·科學家·以及新聞記者·攝影記者，沒有一個不想目睹這第四顆原子彈在人世間所造成的奇蹟。可是當他們興高彩烈地前往太平洋比基尼珊瑚島的時候，不識相的科學家和地震學家，忽然向他們發出駭人聽聞的警吿，不是說，原子炸彈在海中爆炸足使地球外壳分裂為二，恐將無一人生還報吿這次試驗的結果，就是說，海中的魚類均將遭受浩劫，無一倖免，甚至還有人說，世界的氣候亦將因此發生變化。這些雖然都是危詞聳聽，但是這次試驗對於整個世界，總含有非常重大的意義，足使今後的世界政局為之改觀。</p>
<p>今天尙祗第四顆原子彈爆炸後的第三天，欲知這一塲大試驗的全部結果，還不可能。據負責指揮原子炸彈試驗的白朗第海軍中將報吿稱：「十字街演習已經眞正成功了！」各靶子軍艦所受的損傷情形，還在調查中。所以截至執筆為止，原子炸彈對於海軍究有何種威力，仍未便妄加臆測。各外國通訊社所發表的消息，其實不免都是皮相之談，原子專家與實際負責試驗的人員，對於這一塲大試驗，決不會輕易發表意見的。何况原子炸彈此時似乎看做美國維持世界和平唯一的法寳，美國對於試驗結果，未必即肯公開發表的。白朗第中將所謂「眞正成功」，仍是一個時代的啞謎，可信而亦不可信。但不問這次試驗的結果如何，原子炸彈問題依然是美蘇兩國互相猜疑的核心，也是世界和平與毀滅的關鍵。誠如美國衆議院軍事委員會主席梅氏所說，「不論比基尼試驗的結果如何，原子能管制委員會的態度終是不改變的」。</p>
<p>蘇聯所最不滿意美國的地方，莫過於美國不肯把原子能的秘密公開出來，迭次指謫美國以原子炸彈相威脅，並稱美國外交為原子外交，甚至把戰後所有國際會議的失敗，均歸咎於美國保持原子能秘密。最近蘇聯輿論界更進一步，嘲笑美國人民大半患了「原子病」。這次美國試驗原子炸彈，對於蘇聯不啻又添一重剌激，更加重了蘇聯人民的「原子恐懼病」。以目前的國際局勢而論，為消除美蘇兩國間的猜疑計，為打開目前的國際僵局計，解決原子能問題，確實是刻不容緩的事了。最近聯合國原子能委員會開會，美國代表巴魯樞提議，主張將原子能交國際機構管制，並聲明美國在國際機構成立後，願將所有原子炸彈交出銷毀，並從此不再製造。前天該委員會已指定美蘇英法墨澳六國組織小組委員會，草擬原子彈管理方案。我們以為巴魯樞的提議不失為世界和平的福音，各國應該趕快草擬管理方案出來。可惜蘇聯代表葛羅米柯仍表示異議，而另外提出一個建議，又未為美國所能同意。兩國爭執不下的、，乃在「否決權」問題。雙方為了否决權的存廢，意見相左，又使這個當前最嚴重的問題擱淺了。好事多磨，誠使一般渴望世界和平的人們，為之氣短。</p>
<p>科學家發明原子炸彈，使第二次世界大戰得以提早結束，確有極大的貢獻，且使這個世界步入原子時代，如能將原子能應用於工業生產，則對於全人類的幸福尤必有莫大之裨益。所憾的，現今原子能這樣怪物，還只停留在殺人利器的階段，以致美蘇兩國為此互相猜疑。所以我們深望比基尼這一塲大試驗，能給全人類一個驚心動魄的敎訓，從此大澈大悟，在各國之間，不復互相疑忌，而能推誠合作，使殺人的凶器一變而為人類的福音。如此，戰後的世界也就可以步人和平繁榮的新時代了。</p>

<h3>蘇聯代表接受折衷案　特港劃為自治地帶　義南邊界綫成立協議　四外長會議急轉直下</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：四强外長會議，今日急轉直下，蘇聯已接受法方所提之折衷案，將特里埃斯特港劃為自治地帶。</p>

<h3>菲律賓獨立前夕　羅合斯總統宣言　願與美及盟邦保持合作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺一日電〕菲律賓總統羅哈斯，今日囑聯合社發表宣言稱：余茲以菲律賓總統身份聲明對美國之外交政策，尤其對遠東及聯合國家所行政策深願開誠佈公與之合作。承認美國在遠東居領導地位，對美國高尚之目標及其利人精神，發生極大信任。余敢斷言美國之對外政策，將常以此種高尙理想為其出發點。美國固不欲在遠東任何一地獲取利益，余不僅堅欲對美國在菲所行政策表示合作，且更欲盡菲政府之所能，使美國欲在此間建立之陸海空軍永久基地獲得保障。</p>
<p>軍事經濟　緊密聯擊</p>
<p>此外，余亦擬定防衛菲賓律辦法，俾使與美國保衛菲律賓基地之計劃，發生緊密聯繫。吾人並將以全力組織菲律賓陸軍，使其與此間美駐軍通力合作，余更將鼓勵美國資金流入菲律賓。非島飽受戰禍，經濟上實已成價空狀態，初無充分資金以供　興之用，以故美國如不來投資，勢將另外仰給其他國家。為避免將來引起政治糾紛而陷菲律賓於極度危險境地，余願對此先事聲明。大多數菲人對美國人民幾均表示異常親切與感激，無一例外。</p>
<p>駢肩作戰　無上光榮</p>
<p>美國有偉大之歷史與傳統，吾人受其薰陶殆已甚深，菲人獨立後，將繼續衋力與美國保持友好關係。吾人客或不能與美國維持親密之政治關係，惟與美國各種制度各種團體之友善關係，必將保持不衰。余至誠希望此後永無戰爭，但如不幸事與願違，美國再度為保護自由與人權而使用武力，則余深信菲律賓人民將與美國駢肩作戰。美菲共同作戰，不僅為一種光榮，且亦為應衋之責任。</p>

<p>〔聯合社阿派拉欽號二日電〕據試騐司令白朗第預測：欲查明試騐結果，須數月之久。航艦及驅逐艦雖受損毀，但尙不能謂其已至末日。前此對日作戰時，曾有航艦及驅逐艦被擊沉，但吾人並未因而停造。「獨立」號雖被燒甚烈，但美艦前遭日神風攻擊隊轟炸，損害更甚於此者有之。許多視察　雖認此次試驗大失所望，惟轟炸損害亦殊驚人，即受損較輕之軍艦如留有人類，則中死光喪生恐不可計數。</p>
<p>損害較輕原因有二</p>

<h3>遠東國際法庭　美檢察官開始論告　日侵華陰謀史實　荒木土肥原等為本案戎首　國聯李頓報告書同時宣讀</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京二日電〕遠東國際法庭昨於提訊後藤文夫後，改變預定程序，由美檢察官達西提議暫停審理日本在戰前改變其政治及與論之事項，而從事審理日對中國之武力侵略事件，於是對武力侵略東北作重要論吿稱；吾人於此欲提示日對東北計劃，刺激並實行侵略戰爭之全貌。至一九二八年止，日本自侵略戰爭所得權利計有：遼東半島之九十九年租借，南滿鐵路之九十九年租借，東北其他鐵路之經營權，在安東，瀋陽，營。設立之租界權，聘用特別官吏之優先權，設立郵局，經營電報局電話事業權利，關於礦山及森林之優先權。其中尤要者為鐵路，領事及守備兵之駐屯權，由此可集中大軍於東北。及一九二七年田中內閣出現，關東軍乃擁護政府對東北採取所謂積極政策，意即在東北全體極度擴張其權利，並維持安寗秩序。一九二七年五月以後，日軍大量增派中國，有計劃引起事件，作為武奘佔領之口實，一直發展至樹立聽命日本之傀儡政府。其經過事實如次：</p>
<p>瀋陽事件</p>
<p>（一）一九三一年九月十八日夜，東京及關東軍參謀，陸軍將校及一部官民創造瀋陽事件。（二）彼等以武力佔領熱河，內蒙及東北，樹立傀儡政府，由關東軍損操縱，於一九三二年九月正式加以承認。（三）直統治至一九四五年九月。於此期間利用東北作侵略鄰接中國地區之根據地。一九三一年九月十八日夜，陰謀者等在瀋陽北方近處炸毀「南滿鐵道」，將責任嫁於中國。鐵路雖受損害，但程度輕微，未至妨害爆炸後不久即行通達之火車。為實行此項計劃，該年初會有砲兵自日開來，備伺機向駐紮鄰近之中國兵營進擊。九一八事端一起，該砲兵即向中國兵營開砲。東北日軍自翌日即採取一致行動。駐朝鮮日軍亦擅自渡鴨綠江參加行動，此即有名之越境事件是也。在國聯調查團尙未得結論之前，日本已將東北完全佔領。一九三二年三月以溥儀為首之傀儡政府成立，全受日軍與佔要職過半數之日人操縱。關東軍決定該政府之人事與政策。在財政經濟政策上，日本與偽滿被作為「一個經濟體」。</p>
<p>偽滿洲國</p>
<p>當「滿州國」被承認之時，關東軍會發出訓令，表示：「滿州國」政策必須由關東軍司令官決定，由日人施政；溥儀為名義上之統治者，日本不承認其權能；任何政治團體均不許參與政治。偽滿經濟在關稅壁壘上與日本居於同等地位。日對開發東北逐年繼續決定更急進之新政策，通過關東軍實行。內蒙滿河之政府與人民究全不響應，不妥協。日軍之侵略，續由熱河越過長城向南方推進，一九三三年，簽訂塘沽協定，以長城為其北方之境界，於河北省北部設置中立地帶。民國廿四年，日本梅津大將對中國政府要求將河北省國民黨勢力撤至中國中部，並撤換排日之中國官吏。日在華北推行此種政策，不遺餘力。關東軍司令官南大將，天津軍司令官梅津大將及陸軍上校土肥原等，實為此種運動之先鋒。彼等為强化擴張日在華軍事政治勢力，設立　治政府於華北，</p>
<p>冀東防共</p>
<p>卒至設置所謂「冀東防共自治委員會」。一九三五年內蒙古僅有一小部分不與東北傀儡政府合作。日本天津守備軍實際上一再增强。常時日軍在東北，蒙古及西伯利亞國境，曾引起甚多軍事事變，藉岡政治經濟上之操縱與統制。中國政府為應付此種局勢，於民國廿四年十二月間設立冀東政務委員會，民國廿五年復強化蒙古政務委員會，在此種情況之下，此等地方對中國政府保有自由政策，同時蘇聯與外蒙古簽訂互助同盟條約，因此蒙古自治政府乃大受其妨害，遂展開向西方及南方之進展政策。日本於一九三六年十一月廿五日與德國簽訂反共同盟。</p>
<p>七七事變</p>
<p>一九三七年七月七日揪起盧溝橋事變，此等公然行動，完全違背國際公約。如海牙條約，凡爾賽條約，九國公約，巴黎和約，莫不明白規定國際間如發生糾紛，不得訴諸武力以求解決，然日在東北之積極軍事行動，繼續不已，但猶向全世界宣稱此實為冀示和平之行動。一九三一年九月，日本開始佔領東北時，曾向美國聲明絕無佔領中國東北之意，又稱。對中國決無領土野心。但是年十月八日，錦州被炸，二月一日齊齊哈爾被佔領矣。十一月廿四日日本會向美國聲方關東軍進擊錦州西北部之報導，絕非事實；但翌年一月錦州又被佔領。一九三一年十二月廿二日日本向美國聲稱決不侵害中國主權，是年及翌年之間，日會向國際聯盟發表甚多聲明，但一九三二年二月哈爾濱彼奪，確定佔領東北而樹立傀儡政權。上述一切行動，吾人依據日政府之正式報吿，被吿之承認，共謀者之承認，日當時之政治家及一般官吏之證言予以證實，吾人行將提出於起訴書中。關於此部分曾積極參與之被吿為荒木貞夫，土肥原賢二，橋本欣五郞，廣田弘毅，坂垣征四郞，松岡洋右，南次郞，及大川周明</p>
<h3>張作霖被日軍謀害　崗田啟介已予證實</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京二日電〕張作霖被日軍謀害，今午戰犯審判法庭中，已由出庭作證之前日首相及海相岡田啓介證實，確為日陸軍所害。且為關東軍併吞東北陰謀之一部分。</p>
<p>〔聯合社二日電〕國際法庭今日續審日戰犯，前外相岡田到庭作證。供稱，關於日本因「人口過剩」而向滿洲擴展一事，聞日美間曾成立「君子協定」，已得「默許」，首席法官魏勃稱，岡田此語，實使全庭「震驚」。岡田係於一九三四至三六年任日首相，為一反軍國主義者。東條辯護律師淸瀨一郞曾就田中奏摺一事，質問岡田，岡田答稱，一九二七至二九年田中任首相時，日本人口過剩，因受美國一九二四年限制遠東人民移居美國之束縛，無法向美發展，故始決定以滿洲為移民對象。田中原擬實行其「逐步」和平向滿洲移民之計劃，但激烈之少壯軍人，違背日皇及政府意旨，終使日本陷人戰事狀態。淸瀨旋即詢以所云田中計劃，是否即指田中奏摺，答稱，從未見有此項奏摺，並深信亦決無此項奏摺。岡田於第一次供詞中稱，曾於兩內閣中任海相，此外並會任最高軍顧問及首相，故以地位而言，對當時日本一切問題，及發生事件，均能知之甚詳。滿洲經日本佔據後，關東軍司令部實際上即成為滿洲政府，予曾反對侵路計劃，結果於一九三六年二月，遭人行刺，次年予所領導之內閣，終於被迫辭職。</p>
<p>木戶日記</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕國際軍事法庭今上午績審日戰犯，檢察官提出日皇親信顧問木戶幸一之日記，文長一百十五頁，揭露日本十五年侵略史之詳細內幕。被吿辯萬律師提出抗議，謂檢察官對於木戶日記之兩種譯文完全不同。審判長魏勃稱：此項譯文矛盾，顯示檢察官方面之弱點，被吿自將衋量加以利用。據被告律師謂文件甚長，在接到檢察官所交與之新譯本前，尙未能完全讀竟，因此須重行開始準備就木戶日記所載各點作辯護。雙方爭辯歷一小時，繼即由檢察官宣讀「滿洲事變」之李頓調查團報吿。檢察官提出文件，證明日本於九一八事變前三年，即一九二八年五月八日，曾正式警吿中國政府，若不能維持國內和平，日將取强硬步驟，但保證審愼行事，勿令有何不公平之結果。日方曾向中國提出抗議，謂外僑以大局「極不安靜」，殊為煩擾，必須立謀補救。並稱：東京政府恐「滿洲治安」還愛威脅，或將不得不採取適當有效之步驟，以維持秩序。</p>

<h3>市府昨召各機關米糧團體代表　舉行糧食會議　當局已有重大決定　七八兩月決無恐慌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市當前最嚴重之糧食問題，經行政院宋院長，糧食部徐部長暨吳南長等　度會席後，已有重大之決定。吳巿長特於昨午後五時，其巿府會議常召開糧食會議？參加者有何福驚長德奎　自社會局長吳開先，中央銀行廳總裁陳行，中國銀行外涵部經　陳長桐，中國紡織公司經理束　　（章兆　代），中國糧食工業公司經理江漢羅，米號業同業公會蔣振華，萬　林，陳少廉，場　　，豆米業同業公會刑志剛、　益生、朱承明；經售米糧業同業公會查實三等。由吳市長主持，首先報吿　宋院長徐部長　　結果，並提出具體意見，　由社會產業局長詳細說明關於食米之分配及審議價格辦法，後由經售米業同業公會邢志剛及米號業公會　振軍先後陳述米業當前之　　。並幫政府保障正常米商之合法利潤。經詳密硏討後，已有具體決定。</p>
<p>下午六時，吳巿長於巿府會議室復召開新聞會議、首由吳帀長報吿糧食會議之經過，　稱：自與宋院長徐部長商討後，認為本巿之糧食，在七八兩月之內，決不至發生恐慌。目前米價高漲及當成黑巿之原因，純為上海人愛食白米，其實糙米價錢較廉、日滋　　當，於今災荒　　時，希望巿民多多提　吃糙米。糧食會議中一致認為解決本巿糧食問題，除疏通食米來滬外，同時並須嚴應取締黑巿，已決定具體辦法二項；（一）限制食米之憂價為每担四萬六千元，成色較差者並須降價，由社會局糧食科直接分配予各米號。經加運輸費及應得利潤後，每担售價約為五萬一千元左右。規定各米號須將各種米之價格標出，由社會局隨時派員暗中檢查，並望巿民亦可隨時檢舉。（二）准許米行業採購白米。然其價格不在限價之列，而由糧食部，社會局，豆米業公會等組織糧食價格審議委員會決定之。此後若白米之價格昂貴，而限價之糙米能源源供應。則黑市即可自趨消滅。最後吳巿長優稱：七八兩月之中，米糧確較　難，然巿府現已有解決辦法，今日莭有大批江西米運到，日內即可開始　售。九月中新　登場後，本市糧食更　對不會　生問題。</p>
<p>總聯運滬六千餘噸</p>

制坊　制及鄉　制等等，拿上海來說，上海是工商業都市，是通問碼頭，社會情形當然與鄉村不同，然而吾人研究，拿基爾特的工團制度來做自治的基層組織嗎？工　主意見不是舍於中國的國情，姑且不論，但全上海有大部份的市民是不屬於工團性質的；我們黨外國的以個人爲中心的自由主義，來建立基層的地方自治組織嗎？可是我國人對於家　觀念是很濃厚的；我們拿　　高壓的方式，加綠聯一樣蘇　埃的類　機構來做地方自治的蓋　組織嗎？可是我們中國人傳統的思想是要求自由的，不願意有極端的政治和經濟機構的實現：我們用上海人的馬路商界聯合會的方式來代表自治制度嗎？我相信馬路商界聯合會的組織，不能包涵着各階層人的意見；我們照過去外國人在中國的方法，恢復工部局巡捕房的辦法，來做地方自治的機構嗎？我相信全上海的市民過去吃外國人的苦頭，已經受夠了罪，他們不願意開倒車去重做次殖民地的奴隸的。上面所舉這種種方式，都不舍於自治的組織，而我們的保甲制度，旣具民主性，又具組織性，只要運用得法，實在切合於作地方自治的　　機構。蔣主度在這一次致北平市參議會大會的一篇訓詞中，其中第二點，即說明要嚴密保甲組織，北平是市，上海也是市，保甲制度可適用於彼，自亦可適用於此，吾人實無懷疑疑慮之必要。一種政治制度之實施，要求其得到效率，不是多飜花樣，你來一套，我也來一套，全視乎上下的一心一德，加以運用之而已。　　從前顧炎武先生說過：凡是小官多的時候，必爲盛平之世，大官多的時候，必爲亂離之世。我們這一次抗戰勝利之後，正是自廢待與，力求進步的時候，我們不希望大衙門大官僚　緊到上海來翻各種花樣，弄各種　頭，使得老百姓眼花繚亂，有「一國三公，吾誰適從」之苦。我們希望能把地方自治的蓋層保甲人員，能選拔出好的人來，我們不好高驚遠，要求一日千裏的進步，我們要求按步就班脚踏實地，逐漸地把自治的基礎　建設起來。户籍法施行細則（三）　　（第十條）編組保甲應依自然形勢，及歷史關係，劃分保甲之管轄範圍。由甲之一端設定標準起點，按戶順序向兩帝或四週伸延編組，依次組甲編保。　　保甲名稱及戶之次第，以數字定之。各保就全鄉鎭所轄甲數，各戶就全甲所轄戶數，依序編稱。　　（第十一條）戶之分別如左：　　一·共同生活戶，凡普通住房，及陸上無一定住所以船爲家之船戶均屬之。　　二·共同事業戶，凡商店·寺廟·公署·學校·及其他公共處所均屬之。　　前項所列之戶內，如有性質不同之戶附屬者，應依其性質分別立戶。共同事業戶有名稱者，應標明其名稱。</p>

<p>公祭憲兵烈士  廿九日南京通訊　本報記者毛樹奎　　憲兵司令部爲追懷無數爲抗戰而陣亡及爲淪陷區地下工作而犧牲之殉難將士，於二十九日在首都司令部的大禮堂舉行公祭典禮。蔣主席特　以「以死勤事」四字，縣於靈堂中央，給後死的人無限的警惕與鼓勵。祭桌上供　保衛南京戰役中殉國的蕭副司令山令、及西安事變時殉職的楊團長　亞兩遺像。靈堂四周遍縣　聯、花園、佈　　　　莊電。　　志勵忠貞　視死如歸　　八時正，祭禮於哀樂中開始，由憲兵司令張　中將主祭，吳副司令天　，政治部主任潘砥中陪祭，殉難將士遺族百餘人，及該部官兵三百餘人，共同參加祭禮。行禮，獻花，默哀，績祭文。張司令的祭文是：「雜中華民國三十五年六月二十九日，憲兵司令張　恭李全體官兵，　以清酌庶　花果之奠，致祭於憲兵諸烈士之靈曰：國民革命，險阻環生，倭媽耽視，伏芥橫行，障礙統一，相繼稱兵，　　還起，激怒全民總裁領導，誓掃胡塵，旣寇極滬，優逼國　，赫赫蕭君，養憤塡膺，統率　警，力竭股肱，陣地移轉，殉國一陵，惟我楊君，先駐西京，盡忠　　，壯烈犧牲，成仁取義，憲兵之　，抑有多士，爲國鬥爭，後方剿匪，並　專征，深入　　，謊報軍情，凡與之役，志　出　，視　　勵，衆志成城，神聖義戰，獲助同豐。茲慶勝利，灃都南京，　　節烈，涕泗　橫，　　不味，來格來歆！　　軍政育長前往祭奠的有黃　球，馬超後，韓文煥，　秀　，賀　祖，前憲兵司令谷正偷亦派王志文代表往祭。各軍政機關，各報記者社會法團，同業公會，前往致祭者終日絡繹不絕。白巴素車。至晚仍極擁擠，告祭忠魂，備極哀切。　　剿匪殺敵　勳蹟卓著　　張司令在二十八日執行記者　上說：「憲兵從來沒有向外界宣傳過，執行新聞界，今天還是第一次」。的確，我們對於憲兵是太生練了些，趁這次舉行沉痛的祭禮後，不妨追憶一番我國憲兵光榮史轄。　　我國憲兵歷史不很長，牝一次　　頭角，是在西安事變中爲衛　元首而壯烈犧牲的一百餘人，第一團團長楊　亞就在此役中殉職。憲兵平時即配合國軍服務。「八一三」滬戰開始，駐防當地的憲兵第一團九連，即參加作戰，連長上官定期，首於此役被俘下屬，從容就義於南翔車站，同時陣亡的將士有五十餘名。其後，日寇於攻佔淞滬後繼續攻陷我蘇·錫·常·鎭各地，大軍直逼我部門，憲兵副司令蕭令山奉命統率憲兵警察擔任京幾內綫防衛，與敵苦門多日，陷敵重圍，輾圍突圍，犧牲達三千七百餘人。蕭副司令竟於此役中殉國。其餘如無錫防守，武漢會戰，浙贛綫爭奪戰，長沙四次會戰，衝陽守衛，中原會載，以及遠征緬甸各著名戰役，無不有憲兵參加，且均有難苦卓絕的功績。　　緩靖工作　足堪自豪　　民國二十七全三十年　西嚴重匪患的緩靖，更是憲兵值得自豪的偉大功績。當時川·黔·湘·鄂四省邊區的業山峻嶺中，隱藏蓋數十萬出沒無常的頭類，攻城略地，打家劫舍，抗役秔稅，阻　交通，妨害政令，聲勢十分浩大。當局屢派大軍進　，總難奏效，結果決定派憲兵第九，第七，第十一，三國，兵力約五千人，（　團一千五百人）担任撫　緩靖工作，憲兵上山下鄉，用政治與軍事並進，撫剿兼施，奮鬥了三年，卒將全部匪類肅清，黃岩一役，爲我國憲採用政治緩靖辦法最成功的一次，（詳情見照片）共計殺戮俘虜，擊潰匪衆，達二十餘萬，繳獲槍枝二萬餘，捕慶大小匪百三百多名。以五千人的力量，克服了二十多萬土匪，不能不算爲奇蹟。事後，政府認爲憲兵紀律嚴明，以不擾民不　匪而取信於匪，實爲今後中國治理文化落後腐敗，偏僻地區之對症良藥。就這個例子言，足以說明憲兵的能力興質素了。　　五萬憲兵　寄以厚望　　在我國建軍工作尙未完成的今天，一般重隊的素質沒有達到理想的目標，縣級政治腐化，鄉保長作威作幅，基本政治未改進前，我們更要寄厚望於我親愛的憲兵。憲兵令第一條上說：憲兵勢導軍事警察，兼堂行政警察，司法警察，並其他各院部省市政府指定之事項。你看：他們的責任多麼繁重，過去他們要上山剿匪，要下鄉清鄉，要保護倉庫，要保護軍機，維持軍風紀，確保社會治安，有時當不免對於任何人的越軋行爲予以糾正，或干涉制壓，因此又不免要引起一部不肖份子的厭惡，甚至有人誤爲憲兵就是「特工」，這更應該鄭重指出這是一種嚴重的錯誤觀念。張懷念報告我國現有憲兵共卅個團及五個獨立營，總計約五萬人，全部是知識青年，但他們現在的嶄餉是如何的呢？上等兵每月不過二萬元。這菲薄的二萬元是否能維持目下的生活，是否爲他們繁重工作的代價？這是太困難的事，但他們深明本身職務關係整個國家社會的安危，在國家至上的前提下，嚴守崗位，終於博得了全國軍民的協助，同情，和敬愛。社會服務義校學生讀書不忘救災　殷實商人更當慷槪解囊盡力捐輸　　編輯先生：我們是一羣３　苦的學童，我們的學校是由仁　紡織公司，　光生獨力負換的一所義務小學，因爲我們家境困苦，因此尊師運動，在我校是沒有舉行過，可是前　天看到貴報刋　着湖南廣西一帶，災民的慘象和在紀念週時聽到老師的報告，想不到勝利後的中國，會有那麼多的同胞，在　着樹皮草根，喘延於　餓綫上和處神搏鬥，和我們這裏的人比起來何異天堂地獄！我們想惆隱之心，每個人都有，我們豈能坐視不救？敝校由學生自治會發起賑災運動，請各位小朋友們自動捐出一些零用錢來，救濟我那苦難的小同胞，雖然這次捐的數目很小，派不了甚麼用塲，但是綫算蓋了一份愛護同胞應有的責任。同時我們希望在上海的學生，人人都能夠捐出一些糖果錢來，那麼這個數目就很可觀了。款送貴報館，謹請代爲轉交，這是我們非常感謝的。祝你撰安。私立光裕第一小學校學生自治會謹啓。六月卅日湘災捐款　　私立光裕第一小學學生自治會二十萬元，　　印刷公司同人十萬元，南天　二萬元，蔡玉庭五千元，老太太·李崇德合五千元，以上共收三十三萬元，連前共收二百九十四萬四千一百元。申請救濟金注意　　本綱自坡靈睛霞老人協助孤寡貧病之消息後，連日來函申請者頗不乏人，細察之下，都係　　而非「孤寡」　與定章不符，而應有手續如舖保及甲長證明亦皆未辦妥，殊屬不合。希以後申請者能符合四項章則辦理爲要。讀者意見蘇北連窮人也要逃　規約　　（一）本　絕對公開，文責自負，但切忘長。（切）切勿攻訏私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本　稿件槪不致　。（五）對來稿本報有刪節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　編輯先生：我們四人，是想代表蘇北泰屬揚屬通屬流亡江南難民，向我政府及社會各界哭訴的。我蘇北自上年夏間，敵僞屈膝，多數地方由新四軍佔領，叫做「解放區」，人人歡天喜地，以爲從此可以出地獄升天堂了。不料共產黨執政半年，蘇北人民已完全墮落到十八層底下的阿鼻地獄了。新四軍是極端的專制，道地的假民主，明明的攤定了一鄉担任若干，總要美其名叫做「獻」，例如什麼「獻鞋」「獻綿衣」「獻糧」。有產業的，就加他一個頭銜「國特」，但如能「獻出」，就可了事。今年春問又來了一個懲奸運動。當時他的江海導報上有一篇社論，說的「悠奸要八面開花，」就是借這個懲奸的名目，使地方上任何人牽入漩渦。明明是一個與僞組織毫不相關的人也可隨便加他一個罪名，叫做「隱奸」或叫「幕後漢奸，」往往深夜招集地痞流氓，開秘密會議，勒令他要「指奸爲奸」。凡富有之家當然久經確定死刑，我們且不管他了，就是我們僅三二十畝的小戶，也要加一個罪名，先把人抓起了，　鼓一敲，用繩子牽到游莊，然後把家中的口糧沒收。起初，一般窮民總稅天亮了，我們窮人有飯吃，有衣穿，有由種了，大家想快活一番。不料新四軍所吸收的是當人的錢，窮人的血。各鄉在十八歲以上的人都是民兵，高一等叫做幹部，還有縣自衛團區自衛團。每一次佔領一座城池，先把民兵換子彈，等到屍山血海，等到對方的子彈水碓盡了，或不忍再打了，然後他的主力軍一湧而上。上年血職興化城，如阜城，城河中民兵的屍體無數！我們老百姓何罪，要遭這樣的犧牲。今年四月間，新四軍攻南通小海鎭，民兵死去六七千人，這又是何罪？現在新四軍幹部說「解放區」是根據地，大家要出來一致把全中國打下來，才完成共黨的使命。照這樣看，我們蘇北的壯丁，結果將一個也沒得剩了。你看今年三四月間逃亡人還是富戶及士紳等，五六月間逃亡的眞是難民了，皆是窮苦的壯丁了。他們爲顧全性命，逃到江南來，舉目無親，眞是萬分。現在上海有許多有學問的人，向中央呼籲和平，要求停戰。我只想問：究竟是那個打那個的呢？例如四月間南通小海鎭觀音山，國防軍一團陣亡了，一江之隔，大家皆看見的，究竟是那一個先動手呢？照上海各位受國的先生意思，就是要國軍自動先把武器放下來，聽憑共黨怎樣的打，打倒不能做聲，這就叫做「無條件的停戰。」彷佛要我們蘇北幾百萬難民，一個個跳到長江一了百清，還有家鄉千百萬壯了，一個個供給他當砲灰，這才叫做「愛好和平」。奉請上海各位有名望的先生，請你們一方面切實調查我們蘇北人民的地獄生活，一方面請大家早晨摸摸自己的良心，發表的言論對不起。總之，我們是一般窮苦的難民。我們的中央政府，能澈底救濟我們的，我們當然是喜出望外，能發槍給我們，編成隊伍，打回家去也好。我們死也好，活也好，惟有堂堂的上海大人物，不談正義，這眞痛心萬分了！蘇北泰屬難民張元德，揚屬難民劉長壽　顧德才，通屬難民蘇必貴仝上。六月二十九日聲嘶力竭　滿塲雄辯滔滔　　大會在十日早上開幕，要說話的人循例說完話後，選舉戰便正式開始，橫豎大家是胸有成竹，一會兒便告了當，唱票當見，眞是緊張萬分，黑板上永遠都是「陳錫不珖」，「李任仁」兩個人的名字，一會兒這邊多了一劃，「正」字一個一個的加下去，大家永遠都是相去無已，弄到參議員先生們的面孔一會兒青一會兒白，坐在　下面，沒有一個不是一頭大汗，張大嘴巴，等待下文分解，一直唱下去，唱到票匣空空如也了，一看，陳錫　剛剛四十三票，李任仁才四十票，看來似乎陳錫珖已經壓倒了李任仁而登上議長的　座。但是，問題來了：陳錫不珖的票子有兩票把「錫」字寫成「　」字，又有一票把票子弄糊塗了，這樣一來，爭執大起，雙方引法據典，拚命力爭，一方面要把這三票當廢票，一方面拿出參議員選舉法辯護不能作廢，濟濟一堂，變成嘩啦嘩啦，沒有一個不爭得聲斯力竭，面紅耳赤，請問監選人，監選人不敢說話，結果是議決將情形呈報內政部核奪，一塲風波，方才小停下來，至於應該如何呈請，又是一塲爭端，記者執等時候，正是參議員雄辯滔滔的當兒，寫不到那一頭了。議長擱淺　副議長也流產　　末了，記者願意報告的是人民利與論對議長人選的時期　：沒有一個人對言語的鴻溝發生興趣，也沒有一個人會滿意不　人民說話的啞子，尤其憎恨那些滿口民主，而事實却替破壞國家和平安定之徒作傳聲筒的人，由於這一次的選舉的結果，也總多少可以看到一點人心的向背。雖然議長擱淺了，副議長也因不足法定票數而流產，正副議長究應如何產生，內政部會有明確的指導，人民也一定會起來抉擇，小錯誤也許不會造成大錯誤的。密鑼緊鼓·傾山倒海！　廣西議長宣告難產  本報十一日桂林航訊　特約記者梁小中　　六月是收穫的季節。「民主」的種子從培植到發芽，從風雨裏一個一個地結下「茁壯」的果實。寂寞的廣西，人民的意志和呼聲並不寂寞，雖然一片選舉的高潮，不知來自何方，亦不知去自何所，靜靜地產出一批省參議員，一縣一個，都是人民的代表。「大運動」下商產出的健兒，儘管未必個個都能夠爲民主找到一座光輝的綿標，然而選舉過了，參議員出來了，參議會成立了，老實的老百姓，那裏還理會得那末長遠？能夠替他們說一兩句話也就好了。語言各殊　形成兩大壁壘　　桂林就這麼地一天一天地開會開得那末熱鬧，青年團廣西支團的第二屆代表開過了，全省保安會議開過了，緊接着便是省參議會正式成立的日子—六月十日到來，開會只不過是一塲雨，只有山雨欲來前那一幕爭議長的密雲才緊張到萬分，事情如何，且聽在下道來：　　原來言語的環境把廣西人成兩大區域：一個是普通話區，一個是白話區，參議員使從言語裏形成兩個壁壘，說普通話的要爲　通話的着想，說白話的要爲說白話的打算。前者以桂林爲大本營，後者以南　爲主體，普通話的拉出了一個李任仁來競選義長，白話的推舉了一個陳錫珖來做競選人，未開會前的一個星期，雙方便早已橡煞有介事的密　緊鼓，擦掌　拳，準備大演「鐵公雞」。中南路中北路的旅館，分成了兩個龍門陣，整天的「小組會義」，一面是「老兄幫忙」，一面是「大佬

<p>春秋心情  叔孫如瑩　　有些時候，自己很快樂，對什麽都有典緻，見了好朋友們，便笑着說：「這些時心情很好！」可也有些時候，突然感到悲觀，對生活毫無興緻，見了熟人免不了垂頭喪氣地申訴：「唉，這些時心情太壞！」　　我不明白，我是被心情支配了生活，還是讓生活支配着心情。然而我確可斷定，他們之間是有着密切的相互關聯的。當我無慮於衣食而優遊自在的時候，我也會有憂鬱的心情；當我在困難之中掙扎，苦鬥，甚至於流血的時候，我也可能依舊樂觀。因此，我相信，支配我的心情的，決不單是我體外的一切，就是說，不單是我所處的環境。　　我憑直覺的認識，相信那支配我心情的是我的精神狀態與所處環境的一種綜合的力量。心情的決定，一方面是我的個體，一方面是外在環境。當我的心靈順適於環境，或是馴馭了環境，或是無懼於環境的時候，我勇往了，我樂觀了，我有了好的心情。當我的心靈在環境裏感到窒息，改造不了環境，又不能依從它，於是我痛苦，我拉扯我的頭髮，搥擊我的胸膛，於是我痛苦，我的心情便不好，便憂　。　　心情，眞太像天氣，無常，多變。不是有時下雨，有時晴朗嗎？我們的心情也時有陰晴的。在你心情晴朗的日子，你忠實於生活，發揮你生命的力量，做你想做的與你認為値得做的事。在你心情陰雨的日子，你什麽也不做，你浪費着你的生命，你的靑春，你看着太陽升起來又降下去，而你，只是感到幻滅，空虛，和永恒無極的痛苦。在我們一生當中，你能計算得出你好心情的日子，與壞心情的日子的多少嗎？　　無論如何，對於一個人，好心情的日子是一個莫大的愉快。甚而至於，過這好心情的生活，便是生活的目的。如果我們在六十年的生命中只可能有三十年好心情的日子的話，那麽，我只要活三十年便滿足了。心情壤的日子比起死滅還要痛苦多多的。然而，我們依舊常常陷失在壞心情的苦惱當中。我們忍受着這痛苦，沒有申訴，也沒有終極。而且，對於大多數人，這痛苦比他所能有的歡快要超出許多。　　與其我們要企圖獲得長生的秘訣，那我們寗願去尋找使心情快樂的法子吧。秦始皇是一個笨蛋，正因為他不知道云找快樂的心情。唐明皇是智慧過人，他歡快過了，他有了快樂的心情過了。　　因此，我勸你設法創造快樂的心情。讓我吿訴你——　　訓練一個堅强的意志，培養一個善於審美的心靈，以你最大的自信去處理你的環境，以你最大的寬容來消融你所遭逢的不幸，你使你記過與快樂的心情結合在一起，那麼，生命縱然的短促，你也可以算得不虛此生了。戰士  潘仁從趙景深先生寫起  游池沼　　讀了趙景深先生底「略談中國女小說家」以後，勾起了我對趙先生的懷舊和一些新感。　　十六年前，我在江灣立達學園讀書時，趙先生是我底老師，可是，我寫本文的動機，並不是為了和他有過師生關係，而互相標榜；却因趙先生對文藝觀感曾給予我一種啓示，在十六年後的今日，他對創作態度還是一樣，更給予我一種默契。　　當一九二九年抽作短短篇小說集「誰是幸福者」出的時候，趙先生替它寫了一篇序，序文裏大約有過這樣一段說話：「我喜歡讀「什麼問題」那篇文章，一來固然由於這是一篇學生生活的寫眞，……二來也因為這或許是作者最眞切的經騐。……我希望我能常常看到「什麽問題」之類的作品。」　　今天，趙先生在「略談」羅洪女士的小說說：「羅洪寫小說，似乎由拘謹到灑脫，由工筆到寫意，由堆砌到白描。說老實話，有過一個短時期，我不喜歡她的小說，那就是那些拘謹的，工筆和堆砌的……」。　　趙先生是個最和氣不過的人，他說話或寫文章也像自己的脾氣一樣，向來是婉婉轉轉沒有過火的。可是我們從上面那兩段文字看來，也可以看出趙先生對文藝寫作的立場，他是主張—雖然他自己沒有那麼說—寫實·寫意·白描·灑脫。對於那些工筆，堆砌·拘謹·雜亂的作品，是反對的，連那些無病呻吟的抒情文也不能例外。　　這或許是我對趕先生那種文藝寫作立塲的一種猜測或曲解。可是，我自己確像趙先生給予過我這種啓示，而成今日的默契。而引起我下文所要抒發的感想。　　這也許是我國的傳統關係，一般人多中了「學而優則仕」那句話的毒，同時許多人都把學問的範圍看得太狹窄了，把「學問」當是「文學」，只要會寫文章就是有「學問」，像科舉時代一樣，若能寫得好「八股」，上京考試就可中狀元做大官。　　因此，在中學校裏，喜愛學習文藝寫作的靑年特別多，在大學裏入文學院文學系攻讀的同學也佔絕對多數。　　照理，中國有這許多從事文藝的知識靑年，而中國新文學運動也有許多年的歷史，中國文壇上該是開放出多少的奇花異卉。　　可是，單就我個人對文學發生認識的十多年來，在文學界上出名的還是那些熟習的名字，要是歸咎於出版界的不能獎掖後進，但我還以為有一個從事文藝者的不長進的理由在內。　　我也當過好幾年的國文敎師，我對從事文學寫作的靑年的熱心很贊佩，可是他們的作品却貧乏得空虛得令人讀了感覺到「不知所云」。不是向壁虛構就是無病呻吟，外形是「文藝腔」得可以，事事句子的雕琢堆砌，假使問他們，你這文章所要表達的是什麼，他們却會茫然不知所答。我有時會對他們說：「這種文章好像石膏美人中看不中用的。」我對他們的批評，同感不是沒有，反感的却佔多數。　　我也看過不少文藝的刋物，而編者所錄登的也多是上段所述的那種文章，我才領悟到，一般從事文學寫作的靑年，多是受了這種感染性的。　　凡讀過文學史的人，都知道文學上有許多派別，但本文却不是討論文學派別的問題，也不必「引經據典」。只不過寫一些個人對文學上的感想。至少我認為：「言之無物」「虛有其表」的文學創作，是學不得寫不得，要不得，尤其是在今日擾攘的社會上，睡夢中的人們裏，我們要使他們覺醒，我們要寫出它的醜亞，我們更要認識文學的偉大力量，不要當它是「過眼舒服」，給人們茶餘酒後消遣的。　　我默契着趙景深先生的文藝寫作立塲，我們寫作品時，應該是：寫實，白描……要好像白居易的詩一樣：「老嫗都解」。長篇連載雙宿雙飛（七三）  趙清閣　　　「怎麼？小華！」墨太太吃了一驚。「你想趁早不唱了，你難道打算不叫媽活了？」　　墨太太作夢也沒有想到麗華會向她講出這樣的話！幾年以來，麗華順從地學戲；後來又登台唱戲；一向沒有怨尤過。這使墨太太誤會麗華也像她似的，對自己的藝術抱着遠大的期望。誰知道今天忽然麗華要不唱了，墨太太簡直覺得是一個晴天霹靂！她很氣，氣麗華不懂事；可又不敢太責備她；因為墨太太是曉得麗華的脾氣的，惹急了她；就許會眞的一撒手不唱了。於是，墨太太少不得只好又用情感的話去打動麗華，她明白麗華是一個孝順的孩子。也許這就是被墨太太所抓住的麗華的一個弱點。　　「我的兒！媽為了培植你，所有的一點積蓄，都花在你身上了！你若是現在不唱了，豈不是要了媽的老命嗎？」墨太太說着說着，鼻子有些塞了。　　「我並不是指的現在，我是想再唱三兩年就不唱了。」麗華具體地說出自己的意見。　　「那也要等聲譽大了；手頭寬了；才能談得上不唱。如今還早的很，怎麽就想到這些呢？」墨太太重由前議地說。　　麗華不再作聲了！這次的不得要領的談話，只徒然更增加她一些煩惱。她只有回復她以往的思想：忘了自己，忘了自己的利益；祗為着墨太太；為着墨太太的利益；唱下去，唱下去！理論的鬥爭  傅統先　　人類何以會有思想，又何以要把思想有系統的組織起來成功二種理論呢？我們不是理性主義者，以為人類從先天就帶有思想來的。我們以為思想是人類行為的符號化和理想化。人類在生活的過程中要不斷的採取行動以滿足需要。其他的動物也是如此。因為它們始終只能以遲鈍笨重的行為來滿足它們的慾望，所以它們也只能始終處於一種原始的野蠻狀態之下。人類的生活之所以能够進步，人類之所以有文化，就是因為人類的行為已經符號化和理想化。我們在許多地方是用思想來代表行為，因此，這使我們避免了許多無謂的動作，使我們的需要更能經濟而迅速的得到滿足。當這些思想有系統的組織成功了理論之後，它能指導我們的行動趨向於更有意義的目標。所以理論是行為的結晶品，也是行為指導者。　　行動好比是在地上走路，思想好比是乘飛機旅行。飛機是從地面上起飛的，它非但帶我們走得快，而且使我們對於地面的途徑看得很明白，前進的方向也認識得很淸楚。但是我們乘飛機幷不是要永久在天空中飄浮着，我們還要使它在我們的目的地着陸。因此，理論雖是行為的抽象化，但它還是要能够實際指導行為，還要是能够實際應用到行為上去。　　自從人類有了思想之後，他們的需要也複雜了。有些行為是受慾望所推動的。這些慾望是比較偏向於生理上的需要，它們是盲目的，是以個體的生存與繁榮為出發的，所以是比較自私的。有些行為是受思范理論所推動的，這種行為的原動力是比較偏向於社會性的需要，它們是理智的，是以團體的生存與繁榮為前提的，所以是比較的注重共同福利的。我說是比較的注重共同福利，這意思是說，有的理論指導行為時是着重於範圍較小的團體，有的是着重於較大的團體。愈比較注重於個體自身利益的理論愈容易被人接受實行，愈比較注重於較大團體的共同福利的理論，愈不容易被人接受實行。　　因此，行為與理論之間有衝突，理論與理論之間也有衝突。這種衝突的原因或由於理論和行為的脫節，或由於私慾與公共福利的矛盾。例如有些人根本沒有理論而只有行為。這種人的行為是盲從的，迷信的。當然這也並不是沒有選擇的，不過他們選擇的標準乃是「適其所欲」。換句話說，他們聽憑私慾的推動。最好的結果也只是一架優良的機器。第二種人是雖有理論，而沒有在行動中發生作用。這就是說，理論自理論，行為自行為，兩不相關。這時候理論只不過是一個幌子，一種空洞的形式，其實際的行為還是受私慾所推動的。再不然就是理論超越實際生活太遠，行為無法追隨理論。前者是行為方面的錯誤，後者是理論方面的錯誤。第三種人是嘴裏所談的是一種理論，而實際的行為所根據的又是另一種理論。產生這種現象的原因或者由於嘴裏所談的理論不符合實際生活而又不能不繼續的談，暗中實行的時候只好又另外找一套的理論，這只有圈內的人心裏有數而不足為外人道也。又或者是由於嘴裏所談的理論實為現時公共所需要的，但實行的人又不願意放棄自己的私慾。於是不能不樹立兩重理論。　　但是在這許多的衝突矛盾之中又不能不各是其所是，各非其所非。於是便產生了理論的鬥爭。理論鬥爭的目標本來是要樹立一個健全而配合現實的理論以求利用這個理論來指導行為，使其更能增進共同福利。但是目前的理論鬥爭，往往是流於黨同伐異，有的人甚至於是為辯論而辯論。結果陷入了幾個邏輯上的錯誤，希望從事於理論鬥爭的先生加以注意。　　現在最流行的第一種邏輯上的錯誤就是「投合衆好」，他們以為凡是大衆所贊成的論調便是眞理。所以當兩派發生爭論的時候有人不惜發動較大的有組織的羣衆來捧塲，由聽衆的掌聲來證明他的理論。我們幷不反對把真理大衆化，但是我們不要忘了耶穌是被羣衆釘在十字架的；當科學家第一次說地球是圍繞太陽旋轉的時候大衆都是驚惶懷疑，不肯相信的。美國第一次行駛火車的時候本地人民是竭力阻撓破壞的。何以呢？羣衆往往受目前的利害關係所約束、而一般領袖們郤應是有透智（Insight）有先見（Forsight）有遠識（Farsight）；他們不應衹是牽就羣衆一時的擁護，而放棄了他比羣衆看得更淸楚的先知遠見。我們一方面固然要適應他們的需要，另一方面還要喚起他們更高的驚覺。假使只有大衆的需要是真理的標準，那末上海一切黃色刊物都應有其最高的存在價値。　　第二個流行的錯誤就是「因人廢言」和「亂引權威」。「因人廢言」就是說凡我信仰的人所說的話完全是對的，而凡我不信仰的人所說的話完全都是錯的。對不對，要理論的本身，而不能因人廢言。宗敎家最容易犯這個毛病，凡聖經上的話就是絕對的眞理。假使要證明我這個理論是對的，我祗要引錄一段聖經就够了。現在的政治理論家往往也犯這個毛病。但是我們要知道一段名著的引語不能證明我的話就是眞理。「亂引權威」是「因人廢言」的擴充。我信仰某人，也許他對於國學上有特長，但是因為我信仰他的原故，無論關於政治經濟社會問題，我都去請敎他，幷且引用他的話來證明我的話。這是錯誤的。因為某人假定在這方面是權威，但在另方面郤也許是一個外行，我們怎可拿他做百靈機呢！　　第三個流行的邏輯上的錯誤就是「以敵入之非蹬明自己之是。」這就是說，當我和對方發生爭論的時候我盡量揭發對方的短處，批評得體無完　，然後躊躇滿志，以為自己得到了勝利。但是我們要知道對方的不對並不等於我自己的對。我應該積極提出我自己的理論，拿出自己正面的貢獻，來爭取自己的地位。從理論上講起來，即使我們證明了對方之非，這也不能證明自己的是。破壞的理論家們同時也應做一點樹立的工作！相反的，有人自己無所樹立，或所樹立的有應受人批評的地方而怕別人的攻擊，這也應該加以反省，因為只要是真金就不怕火燒了。　　　　　三十五年六月廿六日國際知識每星期三出版美國的前途　美國獨立紀念日　　本報編譯室特輯　　七月四日．是美國獨立紀念日。自從在獨立宣言中首次揭示出了「人類生存，自由，與幸福的追求」的理想，美國即曾一直領導着它的人民，以其蓬勃的朝氣，向着這個崇高的目標邁進。尤其是這次大戰中，美國成了民主國家的兵工廠，西面擊破了德國，東面降服了日本，它在軍力，人力，物力，和財力各方面的領導地位，已再無人否認。但在精神上，美國是否亦將領導世界，向着「生存，自由，與幸福的追求」前進？而且，它將如何領導？全世界的人民望之旣深，期之亦切，下面這篇文章，是一位加拿大作家對於美國的希望和忠告，適逢美國獨立紀念，爰特譯出，當為一切關心美國前途的讀者們所希望讀到的。　　五世紀時代的羅馬人，如果今天從墳裏爬起來，到華盛頓一看他一定會大吃一驚，這美國首都的情形，竟和羅馬帝國衰亡前夕的景象如此相似：財富集中在少數人的手裏，到處都湧起各種各樣的複雜問題，人民沉醉於燈紅酒綠的歡娛之中，這一切都極像羅馬帝國覆亡前夕的社會。但華盛頓究竟不能代表美國全部，因為在另一方面，我們也看到一切都正在開始，一種新的力量正在成長。而人類的文明是要依倚着這一種新的力量的。　　人類能够似人樣地生活，而不像野獸似地生活，這全靠是有着一種「人的文明」。這種文明，源起於希臘，傳播到羅馬，在羅馬人手裏弄得一團稀糟，到中世紀時代完全隱入了地下，然後又在英國出現，而後跟着移民，到了美洲。在雅典所燃起的火炬，現在是正在美國人的手裏了。這是我們這時代最重要的一個政治史實。　　美國人在這件事情上的責任雖然重大，但其實，這只不過是美國的一個傳統的信念。簡單地說，這就是當初諦造美國的祖先們所倡導的，人類生存，自由，和追求幸福的權利。我們看見美國人正在調整他們的政治機構，經濟組織，和內心的思想，來適應這一個新的責任。自從原子彈發明以來，美國人已更懍然感覺到自己責任的重大。世界究竟是應該和平相處呢，還是讓原子彈來整個毀滅？如果要和平相處，缺少美國的領導幾乎是不可能的。它的軍事力量，經濟財富，工業技術，尤其是，政治思想，在在都使它有此資格。　　資格是有的，但問題是，它能不能够去應用？而且是為了怎麼樣的目標去應用？　　這是十分重要的。顯然的美國可以走兩種路：它可以走過去其他强大帝國所曾走過的路，就是統治世界，佔為己有。它也可以走別的完全不同的一條路，去為世界盡力，拯救世界，而同時也就是為了自己盡力，拯救自己。即使美國是走了第二條路，那末也還有着一個問題，就是，它有的應該是怎麼樣的一種道德水準？因為人性的最高表現不是政治或者經濟的成就，而是道德水準的表現。　　目前的情形是怎麼樣呢？美國最初的政治原則，原是和一種深切的宗敎信念以及個人生活的道德水準不可分的。但近數百年來，發生了一件最最危險的事情。立國的祖先舞所說的「幸福的追求」，是已完全被歪曲了。他們所追求的已不是一種內心的幸福，而是一種感官的享受，奢侈，浪費，物質的快樂。目前，美國生活和政治的主要動力，似乎只是在創造更多的東西，以為如此便會造就成更好的人。每一個政黨成功的政治家和事業家所散佈的思想就是只要足够的貨物生產出來了，分配出去了，那末一切人類的問題也就都解决了。國家收入的巨大數目，成了國家心理力量的衡量標準。眞理的追求變成了新式浴缸的追求。正像是羅馬時代的貴族一樣。黃金被人頂禮膜拜，正如羅馬時代的天神一樣。　　難道這就是美國準備傳佈給世界的哲學和生活方式嗎？　　難道美國昔日高瞻遠矚的政治理想，只不過是曇花一現嗎？　　生活的水準原只不過是生命的水準的一個開始而已。物質的繁榮除非是能培養心靈的快樂，這才能眞正有用。但過去的歷史顯示，物質的繁榮一開始，這一種心靈的快樂也就開始消逝了。　　所以，美國將來的問題，並不在那些目前所爭執着的政治，經濟，或者國際問題，而只是在於一般美國人民的生活方式的途徑。主要的問題只是，美國人民能不能藝維持從前時代的生的活完整，而不致於被物質享樂的沉醉　上歧途？如果能够，那末美國就不會走上毀滅之途，世界也會引向和平，安定，幸福。但這個問題的解答，在華盛頓是找不到的，這要到全美國人民的生活中去找尋。（原載加拿大麥克倫雜誌，君默節譯）美國獨立元勛華盛頓總統現任總統杜魯門華盛頓總統博物館新光　堪與太陽匹敵　　紐約西聯電報局最近從事一種試驗，發見一個微細的光點，它的光度等于太陽光度的十六分之一，這光度可又很快的發展到太陽光度的一半。這微細的光點是從一個直徑衹有千分之三吋的镕化金屬的坑穴中發出的。所有的儀器衹有收間機中最小的真空管那么大，所發光線之強烈，須載最黑的眼鏡　能對它逼視。　　這種極大的光度可能解決光學顯微鏡研究的困難，確定電影明暗度的新標準，并使照片放大更加清晰。發明者稱之為「凝聚弧光燈」。普通人造光係由真空中的加熱燈絲，電弧或易烯物質的燃燒而發生，但是這種「凝聚」作為發生體。尋常光源的發生力是受著金屬絲或其他物質的熔點的限制的。但是這種新光，當發光體—鋯—發光時使其繼續數位化，籍此可增加它的光度。　　發現者用這種新光作種種試驗。第一種試驗把這種光照射在四十呎闊的房間內，使物體通過這光而投影於幕上，結果保外就醫的邊緣光而無鋸齒狀毛邊。第二種攝影放大，半張用尋常的方法放大，半張用這種新光放大。結果後面半張放大照片異常清晰，連樹上的每片葉子都歷歷可數。　　　據主持此項試驗的工程師說，此項新燈所發光線其亮度十倍於普通的鎢絲白熱電燈，即每方時六萬五千燭光。用些新燈放映電影，可使電力減少，而映象清晰。因此將來在電視放映上必有極大貢獻。此外，應用此種鋯燈的凝聚光絲，可又增加顯微鏡的放大度。　　　這新燈的基本構造是兩個印發電極裝置於一隻玻璃球內，抽去空氣以后，裝入如氬氣等不呆定的氣體，電極的一端塗有微量的氧化鋯。通電以后，鋯镕化而發光，溫度愈增加，光量亦隨之增強。這種燈發生的熱量較小，而光量而較大，電能轉變成光的部份多於轉變成熱的部份，因此這種燈少電而光強。此外這種光絲應用於光學工作，可減少透鏡的缺點，增加光的傳送力和放大度。這種新光的發明將在未來光學界放一異彩。應付細菌戰爭美國已有準備  家南譯自柯里亞雜誌　　據報紙消息，美國已經發現了一種白色而尖銳的細菌結晶體，毒性非常猛烈，每盎斯可又殺死兩萬萬人。假如事實真相確然如此，那么，在現代軍備中首屈一指的原子彈，也不得不甘拜下風了！　　六月十五日出版的一期「柯里亞」雜志上，載有一篇有關「細菌戰爭」的文章，作者夏萊德，把這種新戰爭的情形，構成一幅極可怕的想像圖，現在把其中的要點，節譯在后面：　　假定在一九五八年十二月五日清晨，有一個名字叫做史密斯的美國人突然在紐約一家醫院中病逝，臨死前的情形非常痛苦，咳嗆中嘔出大量的血液，醫生診斷的結果，認為是在十四世紀時代流傳極廣殺人如麻的「黑死病」。但是十五年來美國從沒有發生過這種疾病，這真把美國的醫學家怔住了！　　再假定就在這個時期，國際的局勢發生了激變。新軸心國的使節，為了和國務院談判演成僵局而方才回國。若干觀察家以為戰爭隨時可以發生，敵國將用原子火箭之類的武器發動攻擊，另一部份觀察家則認為這是不可能的，因為在聯合國嚴密監督之下，已經沒有一個國家可以利用放射性物　于戰爭了。　　就在那一天，紐約又有一人死于黑死病，同時各醫院中的病人都發現有黑死病的徵象。下一天又有六個人莫明其妙地死去，同時邁亞米，舊金山和狄脫洛等地也有類似的噩耗傳來。　　　　間，美國全境都發生了各色各樣的疫病，來勢洶洶。政府費了一百萬萬美金在新墨西哥州沙漠之下建築的地下實驗室和軍火廠中，工人們都患著危險的傳染病而病倒了。　　假如在一九五八年真的發生了這種情形，意思就是說第三意世界大戰業已開始。事態的發展，出乎一般軍事專家的意料之外，原來第一個出來一獻身手的，並不是原子彈而是細菌戰爭。　　敵人並不需要原子彈。當進攻的于戰事發生後的第七天在美國兩海岸登陸時，他們會發現美國的軍隊正在嘔吐腹瀉，城中的平民也軟弱得不能起而保衛他們的家庭，橋頭堡就此成立起來了。　　上面所說的一切，是一幅想像的圖畫，描寫假如第三次世界大戰爭發生，美國可能遭遇的慘禍，所幸美國在第二次世界大戰期間，為了預防敵人的暗算，早已對于細菌的性質具有豐富的知識，從使敵人想用細菌來攻擊我們，但是一想到後果的嚴重以及美國的報復之後，也不得不加以考慮。　　細菌戰爭是比較緩慢的一種東西，它不能立刻置一國於死命，假如被襲擊的國家是有準備的話，她也可以「以牙還牙」。美國是有準備的，對於細菌戰爭肯有更豐富的知識，不但可以防禦而在必要時還可以發動攻擊。用更厲害的手段來對付。　　　但是大多數人都同意細菌戰爭是一種真正嚴重的威脅。這種東西。任何「無」的小國家都可以秘密製造，把大學實驗室甚至釀酒所變成培養毒菌的工廠。　　　然則，細菌戰爭真的會發生麼？美國連軍醫處主任史密斯海軍少將認為細菌戰爭實在太超出人類控制的範圍，對於侵略者和被侵略者同樣具有危險性，如非敵人在絕望的時候，或許不致於出此下策。　　　但是有一點極值得考　，就是細菌戰爭的成本比較輕，譬如為了製造原子彈美國曾經費二十萬萬美金，但是研究細菌起來，是不必需要如此巨款的。所以在造不起原子彈的國家，頗有加以一試的可能性。</p>

<p>自由談空中停留  少夫　　前些時飛機不斷地出事，潘小夢一家乘中航公司的飛機火蹤，至今尙無下文；戴笠一行乘軍用機撞山，人機供燬；因此，若干人搭上飛機，不免都揑住一把汗。有幾個要人，指定非四引掣的飛機不乘，理由在：即使壞了兩個引擎還有兩個可飛。　　空軍裏的朋友常常說：除非必要，飛機還是少坐為妙，也許你乘一百次無事，一次有事那就一切都完了。道理當然很對。古語的「千金之子，坐不垂堂。」雖不能和這比擬，但保身則一。我並不是一個反科學的頑固份子，而飛行失事的紀錄，在今日也不過千分之四五。不過因為飛機遨遊於浩渺無邊的大空，無着無落，無倚無靠，一分鐘一秒鐘可以無影無蹤，似乎總覺得危險性很大。　　記得有一個名人，他是科學家，而且留學國外，他從不乘飛機，人家問其故，他答說：除非飛機能在空中停留。當時這種答語好像開玩笑，好像神話，仔細一想，飛機的確還應該有進步。　　曾幾何時，却證明這位先生的話決非不可能的空想了，請看——　　〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕據海軍部宣布：美國新造戰鬥機一種，即將問世，能在直綫地位停留空中，其模型與現有各種飛機絕然不同，兩冀長度與骨架相等，極富流動性，僅須駕駛員兩人，即可使飛機停留空中不墜。　　再過幾年，飛機在空中，覺不像汽軍在馬路上一樣，出了手病，拋錨下來修理好了再飛，那還有什麼危險可言哩！　　科學的本身就代表着進步，不可想像這個字將來一定會絕跡的罷！自卑  葛尚德　　「自卑」，像是一條鎖鍊，緊緊的束縛着我，使我絲毫動彈不得，在翻騰着巨濤的大海面前，我就覺得自己的渺小；在孜孜硏究的學者面前，我就覺得自己的空虛；生機蓬勃的靑年面前，我就覺得自己的呆鈍。總之，我是自慚形穢，自知己身在大自然和大社會中，一點沒有値得驕傲的地方。於是，我就不得不自卑了。　　說到驕傲，眞的，我在好幾年前，也曾有過自驕自傲的一個時期。我曾經因為著過和譯過幾本單行本而感到驕傲，曾經因為坐了皇后號和總統號吃過海水而感到驕傲，曾經因為踏上了大學的講蓋而感到驕傲，甚至因為娶到了一個柔和的妻組成了一個美滿的小家庭而感到驕做。但是。不知道什麽時候起，「自卑』開始闖進了我的心田，而且不斷拓展它的地盤。現在，我的整個心田，已經完全成為「自卑」所佔有的領域。當然，「自卑」的拓展過程和「驕傲」的消減過程。這二者的發展的速度，是成為正比例的——一方面是「自卑」的迅速滋大，另一方面也就是「驕傲」的迅速消逝。　　這就是說：我和別人，在性格上，有一個頗為顯著的差異。（當然，這或許僅是我的臆斷，世間或許也有甚至很多和我的性格相同的人。）別人的腦海中，都有着甜蜜的美麗的回憶。縱使這種回憶的「題材」，即是所謂「住事」，是辛酸的，醜惡的，但他們會在「懷舊」的意緒下，把它改變為甜蜜和美麗。至於我，天就沒有賦與我這種特長。而且，相反的，當年自鳴得意的種種「成就」，現在，在回憶中，一切都變成了虛幻。　　我明白我的譯著僅是經過排植的沒靈魂的鉛字的累積，我明白吃海水並不就是學問之探求的代名詞，我明白踏上大學的謠　僅是留聲機的開放，我明白沒有經濟基礎的小家庭終難逃避貧困的襲擊。於是，我就成為「自卑」的俘虜了。　　現在，不僅我自己覺得是一個自卑者，就是知己的朋友也覺得我是一個自卑者了。（必須註明的是他和我分袂過十餘年，他沒有見到過我的自驕傲者顯落為自卑者的過程。）　　有一天，朋友介紹我去拜防一位　往已久的先進，經過了十餘分鐘的談話之後，我和朋友一同興辭而出。在途中，朋友這樣的對我說：　　「剛才你的態度太偏促了。你祗坐上了半個沙發，身體太向臆傾側，而且還時常搔頭。」　　朋友的批評是深中肯　的。他的話，就是一面明澈的鏡子。在這面鏡子中，淸晰地反映出了我這個自卑者的一副自卑的姿態。我禁不住要向我的形子喝問：「喂！你就是我嗎？」　　到今天，我才發現了謙　和自卑的嚴格的界限：謙虛會博得人家的尊敬，而自卑，最多也祗能博得人家的憐憫。　　我要掙脫「自卑」的枷鎖。需要刺激  楊謀　　一杯濃濃的紅茶，或者，一客冷冷的冰淇淋，這够多麽回味。精神，可也不是為之一爽麽？但是，一杯白開水，尤其是混混吞吞的，即使在最渴的時候，也往往覺得好像這是一種浪費。沒有刺瀲，也永遠引不起愛戀的懷念，剛嚥過喉　，一切也似乎結束。　　我是這麼想的，這也許僅是我一人的偏見。但是，一個人生活在世界上，又從何而能好好惡惡呢？明知這是一杯毒藥，也許有時要皺着眉喝它。永遠扯着順風的蓬，像一隻帆船般的航行在海裏，我想也不十分可能的吧。　　因此，我討厭，我恨，溫吞的白開水，也只是一種感情的抗議而已，可不是我還老喝着它嗎？有什麽法子呢？我想，　　我也恨溫吞的白開水式的生活。　　但是，在周近的伙伴裏，好像都已經染着了白開水性的傳染病。他們好像以白開水為生活的中心，來發展他們的人生哲學。　　營如說，你有事找着他，他不斷然的拒絕，也不滿口的承諾，只是唯唯否否，是是非非，說了一天，也沒有一個結果。接下來是辦手續，行公事，拖拖宕宕，或者再拉出些七紛八歧的關係來，總使盡量遠水救近火，非慢好像不足以表示他的身份和地位。　　他有事找你，也是轉灣抹角，一忽兒許願，一忽兒稱謝，纏個不休，好不容易兜上幾個大圈把本意說了出來。你答應了，又是唯恐其不牢的千可萬囑。你認為難辦到，却又苦苦的擾不停。——他們的生活中，就永遠沒有痛快二個字。　　白開水，白開水，淡淡的生活。雖不向後退，但也永遠滯留在停點，左也徬徨，右也徘徊，踟躇不能進，在時代潮流的映演下，不是一天天的倒車麽？　　濃醇，激起上進的奮鬥心，　　——我想，這才是生活的本質。中國古書逃難　影寫工作四年完成　等候船隻運回北平  影呆　　不久之前，紐約講壇報曾刋戰一文，述及中國古書於一九四一年，運往美國逃難，託彼邦國會圖書館代為保管，美國人士，咸認此種古書，為稀世珍本，故在美之時，曾用影寫考貝，以廣流傳，而溝通中西文化。今者戰事結束，重見和平，所有古書，正待船運回，送歸北平國立圖書館。惟篇帙浩繁，所佔艙位，當極巨大云。　　戰爭期內，海外各國，曾有不少圖書，運往美國，誓託保管。以彼邦獨處北美，似較安全。而最近美國會圖書館工作人員，將英國託管之書籍，在加緊工作下提早歸還後，接着就進行送回中國古書一事，總共為三千本。據談館東方圖書部主任奧賽赫曼爾語人，謂該批古書，當初由中國圖書館專家，北平國立圖書館職員王忠敏氏，於珍珠港事件前一月，設法運往美國。戰爭期內，始終安全，惟並非靜止不動，因逐一影印之故。　　美人咸認三千古書，皆為稀世珍本，有關世界文化，當初得胡適博士代表中國政府，同意美國設法刋行影寫本。而使世界各地，今後皆有此種古書流傳，此為學術家所極端歡迎者。館內職員，從事影寫工作，歷時有四年之久，每一古霄，事前加以審閱，再行影寫，務使與原本不稍走樣。書成之後，無一為美國所早經蒐得者。自一九四二年開始後，到去歲十一月，工作才完，影寫之書，凡二千五百五十八册，費軟片一千零四十五卷，每卷冲晒一千到一千三百次，總共有二百五十萬頁。十世紀左右的中國古本，前此各國學生未嘗一見者，今後得能閱讀了。　　此三千古本之中，大多為宮中所藏，即中國民衆，亦不得閱看。到一九一二年時，淸室推翻，方始陳列於北平國立圖書館，民衆得以借閱。有關王室之古書，如北齊諸誌，原初由宋代刋印。而明元古本佔數更多，其中如明史四百卷，世上並無仿本，無從獲得。早期風行之小說，短篇故事及戲曲等，以往為中國學者所忽略者，今日也極度注意了。故此種書籍，設法影寫，美人亦視為極有價値。今後美國的譯述家，對於明代歷史，可因以多得不少知識。　　美國作家，更確認中國未來歷史之發輝光大，都可由此種古本中推究而得到斷案。有關明代歷史者，如「洪武誌」一書，總共四卷，繪有圖表，可證明彼時中國每十年整理人丁册一次。另有古史一部，共四十卷，而目前所存者僅三十四卷，亦為珍本。其他述及明代帝皇之書，種類甚多，大部有影寫本了。這樣一來，三千古書的一次逃難，不啻是使中國一部分古代文化得到流傳世界的機會。三個早晨  孫乃康　　第一個早晨，他穿着淡翠的西裝，黃色的革履，戴着火帽，握着司的克。認識他的人遇着他，對他點點頭，堆着虛偽的諛論的笑臉。　　第二個早晨，他換上長衫，穿上布鞋，諷識他的人遇着他，對他點點頭，裝着嚴肅的收歛的正臉。　　第三個早晨，他換上土布短衫褲。拖着破鞋，認識他的人遇着他。側着頭向他瞥了半瞥，匆匆地閃去了！　　他沒有移胎，沒有換骨。一切均未改變。然而認識他的人，在三個早晨上換了三副不同的面目！連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（五十二）  張樂平作上海人在台灣  乃藩　　上海人在台灣，美國兵在上海一樣。上海貨在台灣，也好像美國貨在上海一樣。　　上海人的衣　入時，容貌映麗，風度洒落，比起台灣同胞，頗有不可同日而語之感。台灣的物價，一般都比上海便宜、而且台幣的幣值高，買東西都是以幾元幾角為單位，一張百元票，就須鄭重其事了。上海人用慣大票面，所以在台灣人看來，就揮金如土了。　　在台灣買東西，向來是劃一不二價的，可是還價是上海人的天性，什麽東西都得還一下價。折扣打得愈大，愈覺得滿意。於是，台灣人迎合了上海人的心理，把物價　外的提高，憑你用眼光去還僅。　　商店昨廣吿，都以「上海製品」為號召，價格也高上幾倍。可是有些是冒充上海貨，有些則是上海的　脚貨。好貨到台灣來，當地人不識貨，也買不起。粗紗的汗衫和細紗的汗衫標同樣的價錢，商店批棉織品用秤來秤斤量，那一樣重那一樣就値錢。　　香烟也是一樣，這裏的街頭都充斥着上海的捲烟，可是這些　烟都是「八級」「九級」品，牌名都是上海不曾見過的。但在這裏已經非常吃香。因為本地的捲烟來，一股靑草味就叫人無法下咽。好烟到這裏來是沒有銷路的，因為沒有人買得起。就是　腳烟，也只有上海人吸，台灣人這是吸他們三塊錢一包的「祖　牌」和「光復牌」。　　上海的出版物也有一部份販到這裏來的，薄薄的週刋得賣二三十塊錢一本，厚一些的月刋就在百元左右。這在台灣人是可望而不可即的。上海人也無意於此，於是這些新刊乃成櫥窗中的裝飾品了。　　上海人趨之若驚的電影，在這裏却大倒胃口，雖然座位舒適，價目便宜（每次八元），但映的片子都是「泰香運」「碧玉　」一類，似乎只有宅而却步了。　　在日本人「晨民化」政策下的台灣人，向來抱着「日本人第一」「日本貨第一」的觀念，現在因為上海人在此的「紮台型」，據說已經漸漸的「服貼」了。名小說家賽珍珠女士榮任印度飢饉急賑會主席，由美啓程赴印。此為其在紐約機塲與會中同人握別之情形。中立者為芝加哥大學經濟學部主任許斯，與之握手者即賽珍珠女士。作家幽默  忠祈　　一個作家完成了他的第一部著作，他在書本上題寫；獻給我的親愛的妻子，如果沒有她的缺席，我將不能完成它。（San　Fiancisco　Chronicle）　　埃佛林，華甫從未與人合著一部創作，他說：「我不懂兩個人怎麼能合作一部書，依我看來，這等於三個人合養一個兒子。」（Leonard　Lyons）　　著名學者麥沙卒利的家，有一次遭盜賊光臨，他一反普通人感覺悲哀的性情，竟寫了一頁感恩的話在他的日記中：　　「讓我感謝神恩，因為：（一）我以前從未被偸盜過。（二）雖然他們搶了我的金錢，但未剝奪我的生命。（三）我的資財沒有被完全搶光。（四）我是被偸盜，而不是偸盜別人。」（P．Ｊ．Cleveland）印話石印與牙日翠瑙  高甜心　　石印，最好刻，發揮自如，刻石印，樂事也。欣賞刻印藝術，非石質莫辦，作信印尤宜，絕難作偽，牙印下刀光，故欲求古雅甚難。余學刻二十年，寢　其間，不能一刀而過；蓋刀不能走，不能指揮如意，縱勉求之，遠不若石印自然也。票友印人，當更苦矣，故刻牙印苦本也。　　刻水晶，弱翠，瑪瑙，須鑽子　，車匠車電刻電，以金銅讚刻，數十百下始成一　，故刻晶翠瑙印為金石家所不屑。</p>

<h3>Chairman Met Zhou Enlai Yesterday Morning, Reaffirmed the Position of Seeking Peace, and Clearly Expressed the Principles for Handling the Northern Jiangsu Issue, Appointed Shao, Chen, and Wang as Government Representatives</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received Zhou Enlai, the central representative, in the reception room of the National Government Office Building at 10:00 this morning, accompanied by Shao Lizi. Those present and participating in the talks included Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, Wang Shijie himself, and the meeting lasted about 45 minutes. After receiving the notification from Special Envoy Marshall yesterday, Zhou decided to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang this morning. It is said that Chairman Chiang's solemn and peaceful attitude towards Zhou's visit today was as usual; however, during the talks, his benevolent and kind intentions were evident in his words, deeply moving the other party. Zhou's demeanor during today's visit to the Chairman was also exceptionally respectful and courteous. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang designated Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, and Wang Shijie today to regularly exchange views with Zhou on behalf of the government, in order to facilitate the greatest possible understanding between the two sides during the talks and to shorten the negotiation time.</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" When Chairman Chiang met with Zhou Enlai this morning, he reiterated the government's position of seeking peace and elaborated on the government's consistent sincerity in using political solutions to negotiate a ceasefire and troop reorganization with the Communist Party. He hoped that the Communist Party would also make similar concessions to the government to promote national peace and unity and alleviate the suffering of the people. It is said that Zhou Enlai at the time elaborated on the Communist Party's attitude and put forward the following opinions regarding the future negotiation methods for military and political matters: (1) Regarding military or other issues involving military affairs, it is hoped that they will be discussed and resolved by a military three-person conference; (2) Regarding political issues, it is hoped that they will be discussed and resolved by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group meeting. The Chairman immediately replied generously, saying: "The meetings between the two sides have lasted for years without much progress. The people's desire for peace and unity is extremely urgent. It is best to first resolve the issues on which discussions have yielded results and that are urgently awaiting resolution, and seek their implementation, in order to complete a stage of tasks. By making this achievement of mutual trust and reliance known to the people, we can then convene the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting." Zhou Enlai considered this to be merely a matter of meeting procedures and, without any hesitation, happily agreed.</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" It is reported that when Chairman Chiang met with Zhou Enlai this morning, he directly expressed the government's principles for handling the general administrative issues in Northern Jiangsu and other areas after the Communist troops withdraw: (1) All administrative personnel should be selected and appointed by the government; (2) The government should send security teams to various places to maintain law and order; (3) In addition to the above two matters that must be the responsibility of the government, the Communist Party can discuss any opinions they may have. From this, it can be seen that the solution to the Northern Jiangsu issue has become clearer.</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" In addition to visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the National Government this morning for his first visit since returning to the capital and exchanging views, Zhou Enlai had other activities. In the evening, Stuart Lei Deng, the president of Yenching University, visited Zhou and had a morning talk. Zhou then hosted Stuart at the Meiyuan New Village.</p>
<h3>KMT and CCP Representatives Negotiate Twice, Rao Shushi Changes Flight to Yan'an to Today</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Today was the first day of direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Marshall notified the representatives of both sides. The government representatives were Chen Cheng, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, while the Communist Party representatives were Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu. In addition to the morning meeting, a meeting continued at the Chief of Staff Chen's office at 9:30 tonight, ending at 12:30. The content of the meeting was still a broad exchange of views, with the focus still on the issue of troop stationing. Today's meeting had no main topic, no staff, and no recording secretary. The meeting method will still be direct talks, notified by Marshal Marshall.</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd" Rao Shushi, the Communist representative of the Northeast Executive Group Changchun Executive Department, originally planned to fly to Yan'an on Marshal Marshall's plane at 8:00 this morning. However, due to bad weather, he flew back after one hour and is scheduled to be sent to Yan'an by the same plane at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer May Come to China, Marshall May Return Home</h3>
<p>"United Press, 2nd, This City" It is said that Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. military in the China theater, may return to China. Many observers believe this is a prelude to Special Envoy Marshall's return to his country. Since there are not many U.S. troops stationed in China, Wedemeyer's arrival will certainly not be limited to serving as commander. It is said that if Marshall does return to his country, Lieutenant General Wedemeyer will take over the mission to seek China's peaceful reunification. Wedemeyer has extensive experience as the commander of the U.S. military in the China theater and is friendly with Chairman Chiang and other important figures in the KMT, as well as Zhou Enlai and others in the CCP. If he were to take over Marshall's delicate and complex work, or assist in everything during Marshall's stay in China, there would hardly be anyone more capable than Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>"This City" According to a senior official from the U.S. side participating in the formulation of the troop reorganization plan, he told reporters yesterday: "Special Envoy Marshall is now persuading both parties to bring their views closer together. During the nearly one-month negotiations, the demands of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are too far apart. The U.S. side is doing its best to help China achieve peace as soon as possible, regardless of all difficulties. Special Envoy Marshall is running around all day and is in good spirits. He is still exchanging views with both parties individually.

<h3>Difficulties in Repairing Roads in the Northeast, Equipment Emptied</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd" Chen Yan, a member of the Ministry of Communications, reported to reporters this afternoon on the difficulties in the railway repair work in various parts of the Northeast in recent months and the difficulties that may be expected in the future. He said: "The total length of the railway in Northeast China is more than 10,000 kilometers. The Kuomintang army received about 3,000 kilometers. The equipment in the surrounding villages within this range has been completely emptied. Of the several machine repair factories in the Northeast, only the Huanggu Tun factory, originally belonging to the Beining Railway, is barely in use. In the past, the factory could repair 25 locomotives at the same time. Now, because 71 good machines have been removed, its efficiency is less than one-third of what it used to be. Repair work is even more difficult, and there is a lack of equipment. Today, the railway equipment being repaired is entirely taken from one place to make up for another. To repair bridges, they must be transported to Shanhaiguan for repair and then pulled back to the place of use. The permanent bridges in the Shenyang Shanhaiguan section, except for Suizhong, have been largely completed today. Originally, there were about 3,000 locomotives, but now there are only about 100 left. Of the tens of thousands of freight cars, there are only 800 freight cars and 141 passenger cars left."</p>

<h3>Issues Regarding the Deportation of German Nationals, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement, Deportation List Determined by the Government, Outside Rumors Under Investigation</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd" Regarding the final decision on the list of deported German nationals, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement in response to questions from various parties: "The Chinese government has always decided to deport German nationals with Nazi Party membership or engaged in Nazi activities. However, for some German nationals whose Nazi Party membership is not very clear and who have been investigated and found to have no behavior that harms China or the Allied nations, deportation may be delayed. When approving the delay, special consideration may be given to technical personnel employed by Chinese public and private institutions and organizations whose work is currently necessary. The above policy is the criterion for determining the deportation and delay of deportation of German nationals. As for who should be deported and who should be delayed, the decision is based on facts. However, there are many discrepancies in the reports from various parties on individual cases. The Chinese government must carefully review the information provided by its own country and the Allied nations. Although various parties have different opinions on certain cases, the final decision on the list of deportations and delayed deportations is entirely the responsibility of the Chinese government. There have been rumors that some German nationals, fearing deportation, have attempted to bribe Chinese organizations and individuals in Shanghai to seek exemption. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has long been aware of this. However, the Chinese government has already taken measures to prevent the responsible parties from being influenced by evil forces. The government has ordered the local authorities in charge of deporting German nationals to thoroughly investigate the above-mentioned rumors. The Shanghai authorities have also been ordered to thoroughly investigate the above-mentioned rumors and prevent any attempts by German nationals to evade deportation."</p>
<p>"United States Information Service, Washington, 1st" A State Department spokesman revealed today that China will deport a large number of Nazi Party members who have been active in China and have been listed as dangerous and undesirable elements by the United States. Many of them have already boarded ships awaiting departure, and another group will depart on July 7. Of the list submitted by the United States to the Chinese government, 40 names have not yet been seen on the two lists.</p>

<h3>Economic Planning Conference Day 2 Discussing Salvaging the Industrial Crisis Concrete Suggestions for Restricting Foreign Goods Imports Conference Adopts a Roundtable Format Without Any Resolutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Economic Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs continued its second and third meetings on the 2nd, morning and afternoon respectively. In the morning, Chairman Wang Yunwu presided over the discussion, with the theme remaining "Administrative Outline of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th Year" from yesterday. In the afternoon, Deputy Chairman Xiao Zheng presided, with the theme being "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis". The enthusiasm of the committee members' speeches was as intense as yesterday. Before adjourning at 6 PM, the chairman announced that the discussion on "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis" was not yet exhausted and would continue tomorrow morning. During the continued discussion of the Administrative Outline in the morning, speakers unanimously focused on two major issues: provincial enterprises and the handling of enemy-occupied factories. The former issue had opposing viewpoints, leading to heated debate, but ultimately, it was agreed that improper management of provincial enterprises could lead to economic fragmentation. However, if provincial operation was a means and not an end, it could still promote economic construction. Regarding the handling of enemy-occupied factories, many committee members stated that the government should prioritize economic considerations, improve the current bidding process, and quickly implement leasing and other methods to rationally distribute factories to those who contributed during the war. Deputy Chairman Pan Xulun then reported on his experience participating in the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region, explaining the difficulties in the handling process. In the afternoon's discussion of "Salvaging the Industrial Crisis," the committee members were either economic scholars or leading figures in the industry, so everyone felt a heavy sense of concern. From 3 PM to 6 PM, only the issues of restricting imports of foreign goods and foreign exchange rates were discussed, with a lingering desire to say more. Several committee members spoke with particular fervor about promoting domestic goods and also made concrete and valuable suggestions for restricting imports. Before the adjournment, Pi Zuoqiong, a representative from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, was granted special permission to speak, hoping that the committee members could also address the crisis of domestic and foreign sales of agricultural products, just as they were discussing effective countermeasures for industry.</p>

<h3>Editorial The World After the Atomic Bomb Test</h3>
<p>The American Super Fortress "Dave's Dream" dropped the fourth atomic bomb over Bikini Atoll early yesterday morning. People around the world are worried about the future of the world and are eager to know: After this test, what is the power of the atomic bomb against the Navy? The Americans call this test "Crossroads," meaning that the future of the world is either peace or destruction, and it will be clear after this test. Therefore, this test by the US Army and Navy has profound significance. Not only will the huge sound of this explosion shake the entire world, but human history will also record the echo of this huge sound.</p>
<p>The United States has been preparing for this large-scale test for a long time. In the waters near Bikini Atoll, more than 70 ships of various sizes were arranged in a circle, acting as targets for the atomic bomb, and the surrounding deployment was even more meticulous like a net. The United States directly spent 70 million US dollars for this test, and indirect expenses are more than 500 million US dollars. Although the United States is a country of gold, it will not waste this huge sum of money lightly. Other countries also attach great importance to this, especially those countries that do not know the mystery of the atomic bomb, and want to know the results of this test. Therefore, politicians, diplomats, scientists, news reporters, and photographers from various countries have gone to visit the test. No one does not want to witness the miracle created by the fourth atomic bomb in the world. However, when they happily went to Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, scientists and seismologists, who did not know the situation, suddenly issued alarming warnings to them. Some said that the explosion of an atomic bomb in the sea would split the earth's crust into two, and no one would survive to report the results of this test. Others said that all the fish in the sea would suffer a catastrophe, and none would be spared. Some even said that the world's climate would also change as a result. Although these are all alarming words, this test has a very important meaning for the entire world and will change the future world situation.</p>
<p>Today is only the third day after the fourth atomic bomb exploded, and it is impossible to know the full results of this large-scale test. According to Vice Admiral Blandy, who is in charge of the atomic bomb test, "Operation Crossroads has been truly successful!" The extent of the damage to the target warships is still under investigation. Therefore, as of this writing, it is still not appropriate to speculate on the power of the atomic bomb against the Navy. The news released by various foreign news agencies is actually only superficial. Atomic experts and personnel actually responsible for the test will not easily express their opinions on this large-scale test. Moreover, the atomic bomb seems to be regarded as the only magic weapon for the United States to maintain world peace, and the United States may not be willing to publicly release the test results immediately. What Vice Admiral Blandy called "true success" is still an era of silent mysteries, both believable and unbelievable. But no matter what the results of this test are, the atomic bomb issue is still the core of mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is also the key to world peace and destruction. As Mr. May, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said, "No matter what the results of the Bikini test are, the attitude of the Atomic Energy Control Commission will not change."</p>
<p>What the Soviet Union is most dissatisfied with in the United States is that the United States is unwilling to make the secret of atomic energy public, and has repeatedly accused the United States of threatening with atomic bombs, calling US diplomacy atomic diplomacy, and even attributing the failure of all international conferences after the war to the United States' keeping the secret of atomic energy. Recently, Soviet public opinion has gone a step further, ridiculing that most Americans suffer from "atomic disease." This US atomic bomb test has added another stimulus to the Soviet Union, further exacerbating the Soviet people's "atomic fear disease." In terms of the current international situation, in order to eliminate the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union, and to break the current international deadlock, solving the atomic energy issue is indeed a matter of urgency. Recently, at a meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, US representative Baruch proposed that atomic energy should be controlled by international organizations, and declared that the United States would hand over and destroy all atomic bombs after the establishment of international organizations, and would no longer manufacture them. The committee has designated the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, and Australia to form a subcommittee to draft an atomic bomb management plan. We believe that Baruch's proposal is a gospel for world peace, and countries should quickly draft a management plan. Unfortunately, Soviet representative Gromyko still expressed his disagreement and put forward another proposal, which was not agreed by the United States. The dispute between the two countries lies in the issue of the "veto." The two sides have different opinions on the existence of the veto, which has once again stalled this most serious issue. Good things take time, which really makes people who desire world peace feel discouraged.</p>
<p>Scientists invented the atomic bomb, which made a great contribution to the early end of World War II, and brought this world into the atomic age. If atomic energy can be applied to industrial production, it will be of great benefit to the happiness of all mankind. Unfortunately, this monster of atomic energy is still only at the stage of a deadly weapon, which has led to mutual suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, we deeply hope that this large-scale experiment in Bikini can give all mankind a shocking lesson, and from then on, achieve a great understanding, no longer suspect each other between countries, but be able to cooperate sincerely, and turn the deadly weapon into a blessing for mankind. In this way, the world after the war can also step into a new era of peace and prosperity.</p>
<h3>Local Communications Communist Army Attacks Garrison in Taixing Fierce Fighting for Two Days Before Fleeing East</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taixing Communication] The Communist army in the suburbs of Taixing County has been constantly moving outward during the extended ceasefire period. Recently, when the garrison battalion ×× in Shili Temple in the east of the city was conducting field combat exercises, more than 1,000 members of the Taixing Independent Regiment of the Communist army took advantage of our unpreparedness, adopted an encirclement formation, and launched a fierce attack on our army, and also increased a large number of troops from the Huangqiao area to assist in the battle. Although our army was outnumbered, it was able to resist calmly, and the fierce fighting lasted for two days, with neither side giving in. Upon receiving the news, Battalion Commander Liu of Regiment ×× in the city immediately sent a team to rescue them, and the Communist army began to flee east.

<p>Wuxi Cholera Rampant in Urban and Rural Areas Recently, the weather has been hot, and cholera has been rampant, with successive deaths. On the 30th, the Sanitary Hospital admitted 10 patients, and 2 died. The Tongren and Brothers Hospitals reported a total of 76 patients, with 7 deaths, breaking the previous record. The sales of saline solution in various pharmacies are very popular. The prevalence of cholera has been unprecedented in decades. The spread is wide, affecting the entire county. Cases have also been found in rural areas such as Qianzhou, Wangqi, Lishe, and Ganlu. Due to the lack of hospitals, many people die in their beds.</p>
<p>Pinghu A Large Group of Bandits Robbed the West Gate</p>
<p>After the Lao Yuan Xingxiang Silver Shop in the downtown area of the county was robbed on the morning of June 26, Xu Po Bridge to the West Mengjia Bridge outside the West Gate was robbed again at about 11 PM on the 28th. More than 30 bandits, all armed with weapons, including 2 light machine guns and 14 or 15 short guns, seemed to be organized, and went to the town chief's residence in an attempt to kill him. The robbery lasted for about an hour. The Taiyuan Bamboo Shop lost more than 2 million yuan in cash, the Xidingfeng Sauce Garden lost more than 600,000 yuan in gold rings, clothing, and cash, Wang Wanchang Rice Shop, Feng Shunxing Medical Clinic, Yuankang, Zhenchang, Gongji, Shengxie and other rice shops, Zhengxing Department Store, Xun Chang Fruit Shop, and the residence of Wang Qiuchuan, the owner of Shengxie Rice Shop, each lost about 100 yuan. After the robbery, they fired their guns and headed northwest. The reporter visited the victims and learned that the bandits were mostly from Anhui and Jiangbei, with dark complexions. They must have served in the army. At about 8 AM on the 29th, the county magistrate personally went to investigate. On the afternoon of the same day, he convened an emergency security meeting. Robberies have occurred in the past three or four days, and residents are uneasy and eager for the authorities to quickly suppress them.</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative Accepts Compromise: Trieste Port Designated Autonomous Zone; Agreement Reached on Yugoslav-Italian Border; Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Takes Dramatic Turn</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 2nd (Radio Broadcast): The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference took a dramatic turn today. The Soviet Union has accepted the French-proposed compromise to designate the Port of Trieste as an autonomous zone.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 2nd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the western Yugoslav border line, from Taizitsiou to Gorizia, and then descending a few miles east of Trieste, directly south to the coast at Kabardiskuria. This border will cause Yugoslavia to lose the Tevia railway from Austria to the coast, and the Monfalcone shipyard will remain Italian property. Molotov's acceptance of this border, along with his acceptance of the French plan for international control of Trieste, represents a significant concession on the part of the Soviet Union. Molotov had previously proposed an international control plan for Trieste that would have placed it completely within Yugoslav encirclement, which was rejected by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Returns to Manila; Attends Philippine Independence Ceremony; Celebrations of Unprecedented Scale</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 2nd] General MacArthur, accompanied by his wife and son, arrived here from Japan today aboard his personal transport aircraft, the "Bataan," to attend the Philippine Independence Ceremony on July 4th. MacArthur received a grand welcome upon arrival at Nichols Field. Philippine President Roxas and U.S. High Commissioner McNutt were both at the airport. After disembarking, MacArthur reviewed the 68th Division honor guard, and a 19-gun salute was fired in his honor. This is MacArthur's first visit to the Philippines since leaving Manila when Japan surrendered last August.</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 2nd] The war-torn Philippine capital is today preparing to celebrate the July 4th Independence Ceremony on a scale unprecedented since the landing of Spanish troops four hundred years ago. Philippine independence will mark the culmination of three hundred years of Spanish feudal rule, the bloody struggle against Japanese aggression, and forty-five years of political progress under American protection. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country, led by 116 official representatives, are flocking to the capital to participate in the grand ceremony, causing traffic congestion. The city's population is at least one million, and it is expected to double when the independence ceremony is held. U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, McNutt, will host a banquet tomorrow to entertain Philippine dignitaries and prominent figures visiting the capital. President Roxas will also hold a formal banquet at the same time to entertain guests from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of Philippine Independence: President Roxas' Declaration: Willing to Maintain Cooperation with the United States and Allied Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 1st] Philippine President Roxas today instructed United Press to publish a declaration stating: "In my capacity as President of the Philippines, I hereby declare my sincere willingness to cooperate openly with the foreign policy of the United States, especially with the policies pursued in the Far East and by the United Nations. I acknowledge the United States' leading position in the Far East and have great confidence in its noble objectives and altruistic spirit. I dare say that the foreign policy of the United States will always be based on such noble ideals. The United States certainly does not seek to gain any benefit in any part of the Far East. I not only firmly desire to express cooperation with the policies pursued by the United States in the Philippines, but I also want to do everything possible to ensure that the permanent land, sea, and air force bases that the United States wants to establish here are secured."</p>
<p>Close Military and Economic Ties</p>
<p>"In addition, I also intend to formulate methods for defending the Philippines so that they are closely linked to the U.S. plan to defend Philippine bases. We will also do our best to organize the Philippine Army so that it can cooperate fully with the U.S. troops stationed here. Furthermore, I will encourage American capital to flow into the Philippines. The islands have suffered greatly from the war and are economically in a state of collapse. There is insufficient capital to fund reconstruction. Therefore, if the United States does not invest, we will inevitably have to rely on other countries. To avoid future political disputes and to prevent the Philippines from being placed in an extremely dangerous situation, I would like to declare this in advance. The majority of Filipinos express exceptional affection and gratitude to the American people, without exception."</p>
<p>Shoulder-to-Shoulder Combat: Supreme Honor</p>
<p>"The United States has a great history and tradition, and we have been deeply influenced by it. After independence, the Filipinos will continue to strive to maintain friendly relations with the United States. We may not be able to maintain close political relations with the United States, but the friendly relations with various U.S. institutions and organizations will certainly remain unchanged. I sincerely hope that there will be no more wars in the future, but if, unfortunately, things do not go as we wish and the United States once again uses force to protect freedom and human rights, then I firmly believe that the Filipino people will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States. Fighting alongside the United States is not only an honor, but also a responsibility to be undertaken."</p>

<h3>British Policy on Palestine Provokes Domestic Reaction; Jewish Secret Armory Uncovered in Haifa</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 2nd] Since British troops arrested 2,718 Jews in Palestine last weekend, British parliamentarians have received a deluge of protest telegrams. Last night, hundreds of men and women in London's East End went to the House of Commons to protest the government's Palestine policy. British Prime Minister Attlee defended the British Palestine policy in the House of Commons in response to questions from Labour Party members. It is said that he hopes to resolve the Palestine issue in accordance with the recommendations of the Anglo-American Investigation Committee and is currently negotiating with the United States on ways to restore peace in Palestine. However, Britain will reject any peace plan that is unacceptable to all parties or that must be implemented by force. During the debate, committee representative Crossman declared that the government's policy would only result in us going to war first with the Jews and then with the Arabs. Only by implementing liberation can the resistance movement be eliminated. Liberal Party member Scheer said that the arrest of Jews last weekend was "obviously a siege of the Jewish homeland." The House of Commons adjourned without expressing its opinion on the government's Palestine policy.</p>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 1st] British military authorities announced today that an armory was discovered in the basement of a Jewish colony near Haifa.

<h3>Atomic Bomb's Power Thus: Damage to Targets Less Than Expected; Second Test to be Held Within Four Weeks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse San Francisco, 2nd] Test Commander Lieutenant General Blandy announced today that the second atomic bomb test will be held within four weeks in the Bikini Lagoon. Underwater detonation will be used this time.</p>
<p>[United Press USS Appalachian, 2nd] According to predictions by Test Commander Blandy, it will take months to determine the results of the test. Although aircraft carriers and destroyers were damaged, they cannot be said to have reached their end. In the past, during the war against Japan, aircraft carriers and destroyers were sunk, but we did not stop building them because of this. Although the USS Independence was badly burned, there were U.S. ships that suffered even more damage from Japanese kamikaze attacks. Although many inspectors believe that this test was a major disappointment, the bombing damage was still quite astonishing. Even for warships that suffered less damage, if there were humans on board, the number of deaths and injuries from radiation would be incalculable.</p>
<p>Two Reasons for Lighter Damage</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd (Radio Broadcast): Scientists believe that the first reason for the lighter damage is that the targets were different. The second reason, according to Lieutenant General Blandy, who is in charge of this test, is probably that this bomb was not as powerful as the bomb that fell on Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Blandy's Broadcast After Inspection</p>
<p>[Reuters USS Appalachian, 1st] Lieutenant General Blandy confirmed that the atomic bomb fell on the stern of the USS Nevada and did not hit the bullseye. He told reporters today that the atomic bomb test was not as moving as the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The damage to the ships was far less than expected. During this test, the mushroom cloud rose to 35,000 feet, only half as high as the mushroom cloud that rose when Nagasaki was bombed, but it is not yet possible to determine whether the height of the mushroom cloud is related to the effectiveness of the bombing. Some of the pigs and sheep used for the test also did not die, but they were all far from the center of the explosion. Lieutenant General Blandy broadcast again after entering the coral reef for inspection: All of our personnel completed an excellent and accurate performance. The only casualty was an unmanned fighter jet controlled by radio, which lost control and fell into the sea before dropping the bomb. The remaining unmanned aircraft safely entered and exited the mushroom cloud and returned to base to await inspection. There is still radio wave activity on the sea surface around the atoll, so only a rough investigation can be carried out at present.</p>
<h3>Prices Rising in U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd] Prices have been rising since the Office of Price Administration legally ceased to exist at midnight on June 30th. According to the Department of Labor, the index of basic commodities increased from 177 to 206 in one day, 95 percent higher than in September 1939. Domestic agricultural products in the general price index increased to 285.3 in part. It has also been learned from various sources that rents in some areas have increased from 15 percent to 33.3 percent. Some states have taken emergency measures to freeze rents at the price administration's defined standards. The price of milk in Dallas and Texas rose by three and a half cents per quart, and by two cents in other areas. The Western Meat Packers Association announced that meat prices have increased by an average of 20 percent, and livestock prices are the highest since 1919, with Chicago cattle prices reaching $22 per hundred pounds.</p>

<h3>Far East International Tribunal: US Prosecutor Begins Arguments: Historical Facts of Japan's Invasion of China: Araki, Doihara, and Others Are the Ringleaders in This Case: The League of Nations Lytton Report Is Also Read Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 2nd] Yesterday, after questioning Gotō Fumio, the Far East International Tribunal changed its planned procedure. US Prosecutor Darcy proposed temporarily suspending the hearing of matters related to Japan's alteration of its politics and public opinion before the war and proceeding with the trial of Japan's armed aggression against China. He then presented an important argument regarding the armed invasion of Manchuria, stating: We wish to present here the entire picture of Japan's plan for Manchuria, its stimulation and execution of the war of aggression. Up to 1928, the rights Japan obtained from the war of aggression included: a 99-year lease of the Liaodong Peninsula, a 99-year lease of the South Manchurian Railway, the right to operate other railways in Manchuria, the right to establish settlements in Andong, Shenyang, and Yingkou, the priority right to employ special officials, the right to establish post offices and operate telegraph and telephone businesses, and priority rights concerning mines and forests. Of particular importance were the rights to station railways, consuls, and garrison troops, which allowed the concentration of large forces in Manchuria. With the emergence of the Tanaka cabinet in 1927, the Kwantung Army supported the government's so-called active policy towards Manchuria, meaning the extreme expansion of its rights throughout Manchuria and the maintenance of order. After May 1927, Japanese troops were dispatched to China in large numbers, planning to provoke incidents as a pretext for armed occupation, ultimately developing into the establishment of a puppet government that would obey Japan. The facts of this process are as follows:</p>
<p>The Mukden Incident</p>
<p>(1) On the night of September 18, 1931, the staff of the Tokyo and Kwantung Armies, army officers, and some officials and civilians created the Mukden Incident. (2) They occupied Jehol, Inner Mongolia, and Manchuria by force, establishing a puppet government, which was manipulated by the Kwantung Army and formally recognized in September 1932. (3) They ruled directly until September 1945. During this period, they used Manchuria as a base for invading neighboring Chinese areas. On the night of September 18, 1931, the conspirators detonated explosives near the "South Manchurian Railway" north of Shenyang and blamed it on China. Although the railway was damaged, the extent was minor and did not prevent trains from running soon after the explosion. To implement this plan, artillery had been brought from Japan earlier that year, prepared to seize the opportunity to attack the nearby Chinese barracks. As soon as the September 18th Incident occurred, the artillery immediately opened fire on the Chinese barracks. The Japanese troops in Manchuria took unified action from the next day. The Japanese troops stationed in Korea also crossed the Yalu River without authorization to participate in the action, which is the well-known border crossing incident. Before the League of Nations investigation team could reach a conclusion, Japan had completely occupied Manchuria. In March 1932, a puppet government headed by Puyi was established, entirely controlled by the Japanese army and with Japanese occupying more than half of the key positions. The Kwantung Army determined the government's personnel and policies. In terms of financial and economic policies, Japan and Manchukuo were regarded as "one economic entity."</p>
<p>The Puppet State of Manchukuo</p>
<p>When "Manchukuo" was recognized, the Kwantung Army issued instructions stating that "Manchukuo's" policies must be decided by the commander of the Kwantung Army, with the Japanese administering the government; Puyi was the nominal ruler, and Japan did not recognize his authority; no political groups were allowed to participate in politics. The puppet state of Manchukuo had the same status as Japan in terms of tariff barriers. Japan continued to decide on more radical new policies for the development of Manchuria year by year, implemented through the Kwantung Army. The governments and people of Inner Mongolia and Manhe did not respond or compromise at all. The Japanese army's invasion continued southwards across the Great Wall from Jehol. In 1933, the Tanggu Truce was signed, using the Great Wall as its northern boundary, and a neutral zone was established in northern Hebei Province. In 1935, General Umezu of Japan demanded that the Chinese government withdraw the Kuomintang forces in Hebei Province to central China and replace anti-Japanese Chinese officials. Japan spared no effort in promoting this policy in North China. Kwantung Army Commander General Minami, Tianjin Army Commander General Umezu, and Colonel Doihara were the vanguards of this movement. In order to strengthen and expand Japan's military and political power in China, they established a political government in North China,</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Autonomous Government of Eastern Hebei</p>
<p>Finally, the so-called "Anti-Communist Autonomous Government of Eastern Hebei" was established. In 1935, only a small part of Inner Mongolia did not cooperate with the puppet government of Manchuria. The Japanese garrison in Tianjin was repeatedly strengthened in reality. Japanese troops often caused many military incidents on the borders of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Siberia, using political and economic manipulation and control. In order to cope with this situation, the Chinese government established the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in December 1935, and strengthened the Mongolian Political Council in 1936. Under these circumstances, these places maintained a free policy towards the Chinese government. At the same time, the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signed a mutual assistance alliance treaty, which greatly hindered the Mongolian autonomous government and led to the expansion of its policies to the west and south. Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany on November 25, 1936.</p>
<p>The July 7th Incident</p>
<p>The Lugouqiao Incident was triggered on July 7, 1937. These open actions completely violated international conventions. Treaties such as the Hague Convention, the Treaty of Versailles, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Treaty of Paris all clearly stipulated that international disputes should not be resolved by resorting to force. However, Japan's active military actions in Manchuria continued, but it still declared to the world that this was an action to show peace. When Japan began to occupy Manchuria in September 1931, it declared to the United States that it had no intention of occupying Northeast China and that it had no territorial ambitions towards China. However, on October 8 of the same year, Jinzhou was bombed, and on February 1, Qiqihar was occupied. On November 24, Japan informed the United States that the report of the Kwantung Army attacking northwest of Jinzhou was not true; but Jinzhou was occupied again the following January. On December 22, 1931, Japan declared to the United States that it would not infringe on Chinese sovereignty. Between that year and the following year, Japan made many statements to the League of Nations, but in February 1932, Harbin was seized, confirming the occupation of Manchuria and the establishment of a puppet regime. All of the above actions, we confirm based on the official reports of the Japanese government, the confessions of the defendants, the confessions of the conspirators, and the testimony of Japanese politicians and general officials at the time. We will present them in the indictment. The defendants who actively participated in this part were Araki Sadao, Doihara Kenji, Hashimoto Kingoro, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Matsuoka Yosuke, Minami Jiro, and Okawa Shumei.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zuolin Was Murdered by the Japanese Army: Okada Keisuke Has Confirmed It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Zhang Zuolin was murdered by the Japanese army. This afternoon, in the war crimes trial court, it has been confirmed by former Japanese Prime Minister and Navy Minister Okada Keisuke, who testified that it was indeed murdered by the Japanese army. It was also part of the Kwantung Army's conspiracy to annex Manchuria.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, 2nd] The International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Former Foreign Minister Okada appeared in court to testify. He stated that regarding Japan's expansion into Manchuria due to "overpopulation," he had heard that a "gentleman's agreement" had been reached between Japan and the United States, which had been "tacitly approved." Chief Justice Webb said that Okada's words had "shocked" the entire court. Okada served as Japanese Prime Minister from 1934 to 1936 and was an anti-militarist. Tojo's defense lawyer Kiyose Ichiro questioned Okada about the Tanaka Memorial. Okada replied that when Tanaka was Prime Minister from 1927 to 1929, Japan was overpopulated and could not develop towards the United States due to the restrictions imposed by the United States in 1924 on the migration of Far Eastern people to the United States. Therefore, he decided to use Manchuria as a destination for immigrants. Tanaka originally intended to implement his plan for "gradual" peaceful immigration to Manchuria, but radical young officers, contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and the government, ultimately plunged Japan into a state of war. Kiyose immediately asked whether the Tanaka plan he mentioned referred to the Tanaka Memorial. Okada replied that he had never seen this memorial and firmly believed that there was no such memorial. In his first testimony, Okada stated that he had served as Navy Minister in two cabinets, and had also served as a top military advisor and Prime Minister. Therefore, in terms of his position, he knew very well about all the issues in Japan at that time and the events that occurred. After Manchuria was occupied by Japan, the Kwantung Army headquarters actually became the Manchurian government. He had opposed the invasion plan, and as a result, he was assassinated in February 1936. The cabinet he led was finally forced to resign the following year.</p>
<p>Kido's Diary</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The International Military Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals this morning. The prosecutor presented the diary of Kido Koichi, a close advisor to the Emperor, which was 115 pages long and revealed detailed inside stories of Japan's 15-year history of aggression. The defense lawyer protested, saying that the prosecutor's two translations of Kido's diary were completely different. Chief Justice Webb said: This contradiction in the translation shows the weakness of the prosecutor's side, and the defendant will naturally take advantage of it. According to the defendant's lawyer, the document was very long, and before receiving the new translation submitted by the prosecutor, they had not been able to read it completely. Therefore, they had to start preparing again to defend against the points recorded in Kido's diary. After an hour of debate between the two sides, the prosecutor read out the League of Nations Lytton Commission Report on the "Manchurian Incident." The prosecutor presented documents proving that three years before the September 18th Incident, on May 8, 1928, Japan had formally warned the Chinese government that if it could not maintain domestic peace, Japan would take tough steps, but guaranteed to act cautiously so as not to cause any unfair results. The Japanese side had protested to China, saying that foreigners were greatly disturbed by the "extremely unstable" situation and that a remedy must be found immediately. It also stated that the Tokyo government feared that the "Manchurian security" would be threatened and might have to take appropriate and effective steps to maintain order.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Convened a Meeting of Representatives from Various Agencies and Grain Organizations Yesterday: A Food Conference Was Held: The Authorities Have Made Major Decisions: There Will Be No Panic in July and August</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The most serious food problem currently facing the city, after meetings between Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Xu of the Food Ministry, and Wu Nanchang, has resulted in major decisions. Mayor Wu specially convened a food conference at the City Hall meeting room at 5 PM yesterday. Attendees included He Fuji, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Zhang DeKui, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Wu Kaixian, Director of the Central Bank Office; Chen Hang, President of the Bank of China's Foreign Trade Department; Chen Changtong, Manager of the China Textile Company (representing Zhang Zhaoji); Jiang Hanluo, Manager of the China Food Industry Company; Jiang Zhenhua of the Rice Industry Trade Association; Wan Lin; Chen Shaolian; Chang; Xing Zhigang, Yi Yisheng, and Zhu Chengming of the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association; and Cha Shisan of the Consignment Rice Industry Trade Association, among others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting and first reported on the results of the discussions with Premier Song and Minister Xu, and then put forward specific opinions. The Director of the Social Affairs and Industry Bureau explained in detail the allocation of rice and the review of price methods. Afterwards, Xing Zhigang of the Consignment Rice Industry Trade Association and Jiang Zhenhua of the Rice Industry Trade Association successively stated the current difficulties of the rice industry, and asked the government to protect the legitimate profits of normal rice merchants. After detailed discussion, concrete decisions were made.</p>
<p>At 6 PM, Mayor Wu convened a press conference in the City Hall meeting room. First, Mayor Wu reported on the progress of the food conference, stating: After discussions with Premier Song and Minister Xu, it was believed that there would be no panic regarding food in the city within July and August. The current high rice prices and the emergence of black markets are purely because people in Shanghai love to eat white rice. In fact, brown rice is cheaper and more nutritious. In this time of disaster, he hoped that citizens would eat more brown rice. The food conference unanimously agreed that to solve the city's food problem, in addition to unblocking the flow of rice into Shanghai, it was also necessary to strictly crack down on black markets. Two concrete measures have been decided: (1) The worrying price of rice is limited to 46,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg), and lower quality rice must be reduced in price. The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau will directly allocate it to various rice shops. After adding transportation costs and the deserved profit, the selling price will be approximately 51,000 yuan per dan. It is stipulated that each rice shop must mark the prices of various types of rice, and the Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to check secretly at any time. Citizens are also welcome to report any violations at any time. (2) Rice merchants are allowed to purchase white rice. However, its price is not included in the limited price and will be decided by the Food Price Review Committee organized by the Food Ministry, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association. In the future, if the price of white rice is expensive and the brown rice with limited price can be supplied continuously, the black market can be eliminated by itself. Finally, Mayor Wu euphemistically said: Rice and grain are indeed more difficult to obtain in July and August, but the City Government now has solutions. Today, a large amount of Jiangxi rice has been shipped to Shanghai, and it will start to be sold soon. After the new rice comes on the market in mid-September, the city's food situation will definitely not be a problem.</p>
<p>The Joint Relief Transportation Totals Over 6,000 Tons to Shanghai</p>

Among the above-mentioned rice, 8,210 tons were donated by overseas Chinese in Thailand to the disaster-stricken compatriots in the motherland. According to recent news, a large amount of rice will continue to flow in from overseas in the short term.</p>

<h3>Tomita Toku, a War Criminal Who Massacred Our Patriots, Was Indicted Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Military Court, Tomita Toku (28 years old, from Aichi Prefecture), a former sergeant of the Shenyang Japanese Garrison, was indicted yesterday on suspicion of intentionally murdering under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law after an investigation by the court. The origin of the trial was that Di Weicheng, a graduate of the fifth class of Huangpu, served as the chief of staff of the 6th detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army in the spring of 1945, and was later transferred to the headquarters of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army as a colonel instructor. He was sent to Piaoyang to instigate the defection of the puppet army, but was detected by enemy agent Ma Lixing, who informed the Japanese side. The defendant, Tomita Toku, then a sergeant of the Piaoyang Japanese Gendarmerie, learned of this and led many Japanese gendarmes on March 26, 1945, to arrest Di and widely arrest the staff who went to Piaoyang with Di. After Di was arrested, he was unyielding and refused to confess. He was resented by the defendant, who led six soldiers on the evening of June 4 last year to tie Di's eyes and lower jaw with grass and tightly bind his mouth with cloth to prevent him from making a sound. Then, he repeatedly lifted him up and slammed him to the ground until he died. Then, he put him in a straw bag and used a fishing boat to transport him to the wasteland of Sanguangzhu on the opposite bank of Piaoyang. He dug a hole to take out the body. Because the hole was too small to fit the body, he first cut off Di's head with a bayonet, then cut off his hands and feet, and then slashed his waist. Later, Di Fangdexian, the brother of the deceased, heard about it and asked someone to intercede to dig out the body for burial. The body was covered with mud and was unbearable to look at, but the defendant still did not allow Di to be buried and drove him away with a gun. After the Japanese army surrendered, Di reported the case to the War Prisoner Administration of this city to arrest Tomita Toku for trial.</p>
<h3>The Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case: The Investigation Process Will Be Announced: The Mastermind Will Definitely Be Unexpected: Part of the Ransom Money in US Dollars Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the kidnapping of cotton yarn and flour tycoon Rong Desheng occurred, all parties have paid great attention. There has been much speculation and conjecture about the inside story of the case. It is learned that since the case was solved by the Songhu Garrison Command, it is under strict investigation. The commander Xuan will personally invite the press to announce the process of solving the case soon.

They were deeply afraid that the publication of the newspaper would affect the overall situation. Now, with the hard work of the capable personnel of the Ministry, the truth is about to come to light. Approximately 400,000 US dollars of the ransom paid to the kidnappers by the Le family has also been recovered, and the police will return all of it to the Rong family. As for who the mastermind of the Rong case is, it is believed that the announcement will definitely be unexpected.</p>

<p>Foreign Ships Attempt to Continue Manipulating China's Navigation Rights Under the Names of Chinese Businesses</p>
<p>Opinions expressed by Navigation Industry Leaders</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire continuing to navigate China's inland rivers and coastal waters under the names of Chinese businesses, our reporter paid a special visit to various leaders in the city's navigation industry to solicit their opinions.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing on Baoding and Jia Zhang Xiaosong</p>
<p>Our organization of Baoding and Jia in Shanghai is based on the city organization law. At the beginning of the organization, a few people opposed it, and to this day, a few people still have doubts about the Baoding and Jia system. This is due to a lack of understanding of the content of the current Baoding and Jia system. The reasons for their doubts can be summarized into four points:</p>
<p>First: They believe that during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppet organized Baoding and Jia to monitor our patriotic activities and levy materials for the enemy's use. Therefore, Baoding and Jia is a legacy of the enemy and puppet. We should not do the same as the enemy and puppet and organize Baoding and Jia after the victory; however, they admit that the enemy and puppet's use of Baoding and Jia in Shanghai did have an effect on public security.</p>
<p>Second: They believe that the Baoding and Jia system does not exist in foreign countries. Since foreign countries do not have it, why should we set it up? An article in a foreign newspaper said: "If the Baoding and Jia system were proposed in the US Congress, there would be no room for discussion." Another Chinese newspaper said: "Cars drive on the right, and there are such rules in foreign countries, so we approve of it. There is no Baoding and Jia in foreign countries, so we do not approve of it."</p>
<p>Third: They admit that Baoding and Jia is a Chinese state-owned system, but they are worried that this system is a tool for monitoring the people,剥削 freedom, and anti-democracy, such as Shang Gong during the Qin Xiaogong era, which is an example of self-inflicted harm.</p>
<p>Fourth: They believe that it is appropriate to use Baoding and Jia in the provinces and counties of the interior, but there are still doubts about whether the Baoding and Jia system should be used in the industrial and commercial society of Shanghai.</p>
<p>I will now explain the above four doubts and explain the content of the current Baoding and Jia system.</p>
<p>First: Baoding and Jia is our country's inherent system, which has been practiced for a long time. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the Japanese used the Baoding and Jia system to control Taiwan. Therefore, the Japanese plagiarized our Baoding and Jia organization, not just starting in Shanghai during the occupation, and the Baoding and Jia system they implemented in Taiwan and Shanghai, its method and essence, are different from our current Baoding and Jia, that is, different from our past ones.</p>
<p>Second: Social science is different from natural science. For example, the United States invented the atomic bomb and dropped it on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, causing destructive power. If it were dropped on London in the United Kingdom or Marseilles in France, it would also cause destructive power; The movie invented by Edison can see various colors and movements on the screen in the United States, and what is seen on the screen in China is the same. When it comes to social science, it is different. Whether it is law, education, or political system, it is necessary to formulate its articles and systems according to the national culture, living habits, and traditional spirit of each country, and cannot blindly learn the methods of other countries, cutting off one's feet to fit the shoes, and messing up the system. If we forget that we are Chinese, forget that our motherland has a traditional good law and excellent system that suits the national conditions, and think that what the United States and Britain do not have is not good, and that what the United States and Britain have is all good, then, to put it nicely, our country's name is not called the Republic of China, but becomes the Republic of China and the United States or the Republic of China and Britain, so the second kind of skeptical view is really unreasonable.</p>
<p>The third type of doubt, they admit that Baoding and Jia is something inherent in China, but they only understand half of it and have not studied the entire current Baoding and Jia system. It must be known that since the promulgation of the new county system in the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Baoding and Jia system has been changed from a passive focus on the nature of prevention to a progressive democratic spirit; such as the 甲设户长会议, 保设保民大大会, not only is the 保甲长 elected by this meeting, but also the 保甲长 can be dismissed. It is not only to suggest matters related to the entire Bao and Jia that should be done and should be abolished, but also to supervise the execution of the 保甲长. If the 保甲长 has illegal acts that violate the people, the household head meeting and the 保民大会 can take him to复决 or dismiss him, how can the 保甲长 be willful and arbitrarily市民? Moreover, it is necessary to understand that the Baoding and Jia system is a kind of organization for implementing local autonomy. It cannot interfere at all with the citizens' beliefs in religion and doctrines. Therefore, the 保甲长 not only cannot influence whether citizens participate or not in the legal activities of the party, but also has no right to interfere. Therefore, you can rest assured that the Baoding and Jia system will not be anti-democratic, nor will it be a tool for the people.</p>
<p>Fourth: We are going to talk about whether the Baoding and Jia system should be implemented in the city area in the same way as in the provinces and counties. Since ancient times, our country has talked about local autonomy systems, no more than village and neighborhood systems, 坊 　systems and township 　systems. Taking Shanghai as an example, Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city, and it is a gateway to information. The social situation is of course different from the countryside. However, we study, and take Kielter's industrial group system as the grassroots organization of autonomy? The views of工　master are</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Sentiments – by Uncle Sun Ruying</p>
<p>Sometimes, I am very happy and find everything delightful. Upon seeing good friends, I smile and say, "I've been in a great mood lately!" But other times, I suddenly feel pessimistic and have no interest in life. When I meet acquaintances, I can't help but complain dejectedly, "Alas, I've been in such a bad mood lately!"</p>
<p>I don't understand whether I am allowing my mood to dictate my life or letting life control my mood. However, I am certain that there is a close interrelationship between them. When I am free from worries about food and clothing and at ease, I can still have melancholy feelings. Even when I am struggling, fighting hard, and even bleeding amidst difficulties, I may still remain optimistic. Therefore, I believe that what governs my mood is not solely external factors, meaning not just the environment I am in.</p>
<p>Based on my intuition, I believe that what governs my mood is a combined force of my mental state and the environment I am in. The decision of my mood comes from both my individuality and the external environment. When my heart is comfortable with the environment, or when I tame the environment, or when I am not afraid of the environment, I am courageous, optimistic, and in a good mood. When my heart feels suffocated in the environment, unable to change it, and unable to conform to it, then I am in pain. I pull my hair and beat my chest, and then I am in pain, and my mood is bad and melancholy.</p>
<p>Mood is truly like the weather, impermanent and changeable. Doesn't it sometimes rain and sometimes shine? Our moods also have sunny and cloudy days. On the sunny days of your mood, you are faithful to life, exert the power of your life, and do what you want to do and what you think is worth doing. On the rainy days of your mood, you do nothing, you waste your life, your youth, you watch the sun rise and set, and you just feel disillusioned, empty, and eternally infinitely painful. In our lifetime, can you calculate how many good mood days and bad mood days you have?</p>
<p>In any case, for a person, good mood days are a great pleasure. To the extent that living a life in a good mood is the purpose of life. If we can only have thirty years of good mood days in sixty years of life, then I will be satisfied with living for only thirty years. Bad mood days are much more painful than death. However, we still often get trapped in the distress of bad moods. We endure this pain without complaint and without an end. Moreover, for most people, this pain far outweighs the joy they can have.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to obtain the secret to longevity, we would rather look for ways to make our moods happy. Qin Shi Huang was a fool, precisely because he did not know how to find a happy mood. Emperor Tang Ming was extremely intelligent; he had joy, he had a happy mood.</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise you to find ways to create happy moods. Let me tell you—</p>
<p>Train a strong will, cultivate a mind good at aesthetics, handle your environment with your greatest confidence, and dissolve the misfortunes you encounter with your greatest tolerance. Combine your memories with a happy mood, so that even if life is short, you can be considered to have lived a worthwhile life.</p>
<h3>The Warrior - Starting with Mr. Zhao Jingshen – By Pan Ren</h3>
<h3>Wandering in the Pool - By Zhao Jing Shen</h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Zhao Jingshen's "A Brief Discussion on Chinese Female Novelists," it stirred up my nostalgia for Mr. Zhao and some new feelings.</p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, when I was studying at Lida Academy in Jiangwan, Mr. Zhao was my teacher. However, my motivation for writing this article is not to boast about our teacher-student relationship but because Mr. Zhao's views on literature once gave me an inspiration. Even today, sixteen years later, his attitude towards creation is still the same, giving me a kind of tacit understanding.</p>
<p>When the short story collection "Who is the Happy One" was published in 1929, Mr. Zhao wrote a preface for it. In the preface, there was roughly a passage that said: "I like reading the article 'What's the Problem?' Firstly, because it is a true reflection of student life... Secondly, perhaps because it is the author's most genuine experience... I hope I can often see works like 'What's the Problem?'"</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Zhao says about Ms. Luo Hong's novels in "A Brief Discussion": "Luo Hong's writing seems to have evolved from restraint to freedom, from meticulous brushwork to freehand, and from piling up words to plain description. To be honest, there was a brief period when I didn't like her novels, namely those restrained, meticulously crafted, and piled-up ones..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao is the most amiable person. His speech and writing are like his temperament, always gentle and never excessive. However, from the above two passages, we can also see Mr. Zhao's stance on literary writing. He advocates—although he himself did not say so—realism, freehand, plain description, and freedom. He opposes those meticulous, piled-up, restrained, and chaotic works, even those sentimental writings that moan without illness are no exception.</p>
<p>This may be my speculation or misinterpretation of Mr. Zhao's literary writing stance. However, I do feel that Mr. Zhao has given me this kind of inspiration, leading to today's tacit understanding. This understanding has aroused the feelings I want to express below.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to our country's traditional values, many people have been poisoned by the phrase "excel in learning and then become an official." At the same time, many people view the scope of knowledge too narrowly, equating "learning" with "literature." They believe that being able to write articles is having "knowledge," just like in the imperial examination era, where being able to write good "eight-legged essays" could lead to becoming a top scholar and a high-ranking official.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are many young people in middle schools who love to learn literary writing, and the number of students who enter the literature department of the liberal arts college in universities also accounts for an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Logically, with so many knowledgeable young people engaged in literature in China, and with the New Literature Movement in China having a history of many years, the Chinese literary scene should be blooming with numerous exotic flowers and rare herbs.</p>
<p>However, just based on my personal understanding of literature for more than ten years, the famous names in the literary world are still those familiar ones. If it is attributed to the publishing industry's inability to support emerging talents, I still believe that there is a reason for the lack of progress among those engaged in literature.</p>
<p>I have also been a Chinese language teacher for several years. I admire the enthusiasm of young people engaged in literary writing, but their works are so poor and empty that reading them gives me a feeling of "not knowing what they are talking about." Either they are baseless fabrications or moans without illness. The outward form is very "literary," with every sentence being carved and piled up. If you ask them what their article wants to express, they will be at a loss for an answer. I sometimes tell them, "This kind of article is like a plaster beauty—good-looking but useless." I feel not sympathy but repulsion towards their criticisms.</p>
<p>I have also read many literary publications, and what the editors record and publish is mostly the kind of articles mentioned in the previous paragraph. I then realized that most young people engaged in literary writing are influenced by this kind of infectious style.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read literary history knows that there are many schools of thought in literature, but this article is not discussing the problem of literary schools, nor is it necessary to "cite classics and allusions." It is just writing some personal feelings about literature. At least I believe that literary creations that "lack substance" and are "empty in appearance" are not to be learned, written, or desired, especially in today's turbulent society and among people in their dreams. We must awaken them, we must write about its ugliness, and we must recognize the great power of literature. We must not regard it as "fleeting comfort" for people to pass the time after tea and wine.</p>
<p>I agree with Mr. Zhao Jingshen's literary writing stance. When we write works, we should be realistic, use plain descriptions... and make it like Bai Juyi's poems: "Even old women can understand."</p>
<h3>Long Serial Novel - Flying Together (73) - By Zhao Qingge</h3>
<p>"What? Xiao Hua!" Madam Mo exclaimed in surprise. "You want to stop singing so early? Do you plan to stop your mother from living?"</p>
<p>Madam Mo never dreamed that Lihua would say such a thing to her! For years, Lihua had obediently studied opera and then performed on stage, never complaining. This made Madam Mo mistakenly believe that Lihua, like her, had great expectations for her art. Who knew that today, Lihua suddenly wanted to stop singing? Madam Mo felt as if a bolt from the blue had struck! She was angry, angry at Lihua for being inconsiderate, but she didn't dare to scold her too much because Madam Mo knew Lihua's temper. If she provoked her, she might really quit singing. Therefore, Madam Mo had no choice but to use emotional words to move Lihua. She knew that Lihua was a filial child. Perhaps this was the weakness of Lihua that Madam Mo had grasped.</p>
<p>"My child! Mother has spent all her savings to cultivate you! If you stop singing now, wouldn't that take Mother's life?" Madam Mo said, her nose becoming congested.</p>
<p>"I'm not referring to now. I want to sing for another two or three years and then stop," Lihua said specifically, stating her opinion.</p>
<p>"That will also have to wait until your reputation is greater and your finances are more comfortable before you can talk about not singing. It's still too early now. Why are you thinking about these things?" Madam Mo said, resuming her previous argument.</p>
<p>Lihua said nothing more! This unsuccessful conversation only added to her worries. She could only return to her previous thoughts: forget herself, forget her own interests; only for Madam Mo; for Madam Mo's benefit; keep singing, keep singing!</p>
<h3>The Struggle of Theories - By Fu Tongxian</h3>
<p>Why do humans have thoughts, and why do they systematically organize thoughts to form theories? We are not rationalists who believe that humans are born with thoughts. We believe that thoughts are the symbolization and idealization of human behavior. In the process of life, humans must constantly take actions to meet their needs. Other animals do the same. Because they can only use slow and clumsy behaviors to satisfy their desires, they can only remain in a primitive and savage state. The reason why human life can progress and the reason why humans have culture is that human behavior has been symbolized and idealized. In many places, we use thoughts to represent behavior, which allows us to avoid many unnecessary actions and allows our needs to be met more economically and quickly. When these thoughts are systematically organized into theories, they can guide our actions towards more meaningful goals. Therefore, theory is the crystallization of behavior and also the guide of behavior.</p>
<p>Action is like walking on the ground, and thought is like traveling by airplane. An airplane takes off from the ground. It not only takes us faster but also makes us see the path on the ground very clearly, and the direction of progress is also very clear. But we don't take an airplane to float in the sky permanently; we also want to make it land at our destination. Therefore, although theory is the abstraction of behavior, it must still be able to practically guide behavior and be practically applied to behavior.</p>
<p>Since humans have had thoughts, their needs have also become more complex. Some behaviors are driven by desires. These desires are more inclined towards physiological needs. They are blind and based on the survival and prosperity of the individual, so they are relatively selfish. Some behaviors are driven by thoughtful theories. The driving force of this kind of behavior is more inclined towards social needs. They are rational and based on the survival and prosperity of the group, so they are relatively focused on common welfare. I say relatively focused on common welfare, which means that some theories guide behavior with a focus on smaller groups, while others focus on larger groups. The more a theory focuses on the interests of the individual, the easier it is for people to accept and implement. The more a theory focuses on the common welfare of larger groups, the more difficult it is for people to accept and implement.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are conflicts between behavior and theory, and there are also conflicts between theories. The reason for this conflict may be due to the disconnection between theory and behavior or the contradiction between selfish desires and public welfare. For example, some people have no theory at all and only have behavior. This kind of person's behavior is blind and superstitious. Of course, this is not without choice, but the standard they choose is "to suit their desires." In other words, they listen to the promotion of selfish desires. The best result is just a good machine. The second type of person is one who has a theory but it does not play a role in action. That is to say, theory is theory, and behavior is behavior, and the two are not related. At this time, the theory is just a guise, a hollow form, and the actual behavior is still driven by selfish desires. Otherwise, the theory is too far beyond actual life, and behavior cannot follow the theory. The former is an error in behavior, and the latter is an error in theory. The third type of person is one who talks about one theory but whose actual behavior is based on another theory. The reason for this phenomenon may be that the theory talked about does not conform to actual life and must continue to be talked about. When secretly implementing it, they have to find another set of theories. Only those inside the circle know this and it cannot be expressed to outsiders. Or it may be that the theory talked about is actually needed by the public at the moment, but the person who implements it is unwilling to give up their own selfish desires. Thus, they have to establish two sets of theories.</p>
<p>But in these many conflicts and contradictions, one cannot but affirm what is right and deny what is wrong. Thus, the struggle of theories arises. The goal of the struggle of theories is originally to establish a sound and realistic theory in order to use this theory to guide behavior so that it can better enhance common welfare. However, the current struggle of theories often degenerates into partisanship and suppression of dissent. Some people even argue for the sake of arguing. As a result, they fall into several logical errors. I hope that gentlemen engaged in the struggle of theories will pay attention.</p>
<p>The first and most popular logical error now is "appealing to the masses." They believe that any argument that is approved by the public is the truth. Therefore, when two parties are in dispute, some people do not hesitate to mobilize larger and more organized masses to support the situation, and prove their theory with the applause of the audience. We do not oppose popularizing the truth, but we must not forget that Jesus was nailed to the cross by the masses. When scientists first said that the earth revolves around the sun, the masses were alarmed, doubted, and refused to believe it. When the United States first operated trains, the local people tried their best to obstruct and sabotage them. Why? The masses are often bound by their current interests, while general leaders should have insight, foresight, and vision. They should not only cater to the temporary support of the masses but also abandon their prophetic vision that they see more clearly than the masses. On the one hand, we must adapt to their needs, and on the other hand, we must awaken them to a higher awareness. If only the needs of the masses are the standard of truth, then all the yellow publications in Shanghai should have their highest value of existence.</p>
<p>The second popular mistake is "dismissing words because of the person" and "randomly citing authority." "Dismissing words because of the person" means that everything said by the people I believe in is completely right, and everything said by the people I don't believe in is completely wrong. Whether it is right or wrong depends on the theory itself, and one cannot dismiss words because of the person. Religious people are most likely to make this mistake. Everything said in the Bible is absolute truth. If I want to prove that my theory is right, I just need to quote a passage from the Bible. Current political theorists also often make this mistake. But we must know that a quote from a famous work cannot prove that my words are the truth. "Randomly citing authority" is an extension of "dismissing words because of the person." I believe in someone. Maybe he has expertise in Chinese studies, but because I believe in him, I will consult him on political, economic, and social issues, and quote his words to prove my words. This is wrong. Because someone is assumed to be an authority in this area, but in another area, he may be an amateur. How can we use him as a panacea!</p>
<p>The third popular logical error is "using the other party's wrong to prove one's own right." That is to say, when I am in a dispute with the other party, I try my best to expose the other party's shortcomings and criticize them completely, and then smugly think that I have won. But we must know that the other party's wrong does not equal my own right. I should actively put forward my own theory and come up with my own positive contributions to fight for my own position. Theoretically speaking, even if we prove the other party's wrong, this cannot prove one's own right. Destructive theorists should also do some constructive work! Conversely, some people have nothing to establish themselves, or what they have established has places that should be criticized and are afraid of others' attacks, which should also be reflected on, because as long as it is real gold, it is not afraid of fire.</p>

<h3>The Future of America - American Independence Day</h3>
<h3>Special Compilation by the Newsroom of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>July 4th is American Independence Day. Since the Declaration of Independence first revealed the ideals of "human survival, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness," the United States has been leading its people with vigorous energy toward this lofty goal. Especially during this war, the United States became the arsenal of democratic countries, defeating Germany in the West and subduing Japan in the East. Its leading position in terms of military power, human resources, material resources, and financial resources is undeniable. But spiritually, will the United States also lead the world toward the "pursuit of survival, freedom, and happiness"? And how will it lead? The people of the world have deep hopes and high expectations. The following article is a Canadian writer's hope and advice for the United States. It is specially translated and published on the occasion of American Independence Day, which should be what all readers who care about the future of the United States hope to read.</p>
<p>If a Roman from the fifth century could crawl out of his grave today and take a look at Washington, he would be very surprised. The situation in the American capital is so similar to the scene on the eve of the Roman Empire's decline: wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, various complex problems are emerging everywhere, and people are immersed in the pleasures of luxury. All this is very similar to the society on the eve of the Roman Empire's demise. But Washington cannot represent the entire United States, because on the other hand, we also see that everything is just beginning, and a new force is growing. And human civilization is going to rely on this new force.</p>
<p>Humans can live like humans instead of like beasts, all because of a kind of "human civilization." This civilization originated in Greece, spread to Rome, was messed up by the Romans, completely disappeared underground in the Middle Ages, and then appeared in England, and then followed the immigrants to America. The torch lit in Athens is now in the hands of the Americans. This is the most important political historical fact of our time.</p>
<p>Although the responsibility of the Americans in this matter is great, in fact, this is just a traditional belief of the United States. Simply put, this is the right to human survival, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness advocated by the ancestors who created the United States. We see that Americans are adjusting their political institutions, economic organizations, and inner thoughts to adapt to this new responsibility. Since the invention of the atomic bomb, Americans have felt even more keenly the importance of their responsibility. Should the world live in peace, or should the atomic bomb destroy everything? If we want to live in peace, it is almost impossible to lack American leadership. Its military strength, economic wealth, industrial technology, and especially its political ideas, all qualify it for this.</p>
<p>It has the qualifications, but the question is, can it apply them? And for what kind of goals will it apply them?</p>
<p>This is very important. Obviously, the United States can take two paths: it can take the path that other powerful empires have taken in the past, which is to rule the world and occupy it for itself. It can also take a completely different path, which is to do its best for the world and save the world, and at the same time, do its best for itself and save itself. Even if the United States takes the second path, there is still a question of what kind of moral standards it should have? Because the highest expression of human nature is not political or economic achievements but the expression of moral standards.</p>
<p>What is the current situation? The original political principles of the United States were inseparable from a deep religious belief and the moral standards of individual life. But in recent centuries, the most dangerous thing has happened. The "pursuit of happiness" that the founding fathers spoke of has been completely distorted. What they pursue is no longer an inner happiness but a sensory enjoyment, luxury, waste, and material pleasure. At present, the main driving force of American life and politics seems to be just creating more things, thinking that this will create better people. The idea spread by every successful politician and entrepreneur is that as long as enough goods are produced and distributed, all human problems will be solved. The huge number of national income has become the measure of the nation's psychological strength. The pursuit of truth has become the pursuit of new-style bathtubs, just like the nobles of the Roman era. Gold is worshipped, just like the gods of the Roman era.</p>
<p>Is this the philosophy and way of life that the United States is preparing to spread to the world?</p>
<p>Are the lofty political ideals of the United States in the past just a flash in the pan?</p>
<p>The standard of living is just the beginning of the standard of life. Material prosperity is only truly useful if it can cultivate spiritual happiness. But past history shows that once material prosperity begins, this spiritual happiness also begins to disappear.</p>
<p>Therefore, the future problems of the United States are not in those political, economic, or international issues that are currently being debated but only in the path of the American people's way of life. The main question is whether the American people can maintain the integrity of the previous era of life without being led astray by the intoxication of material enjoyment. If so, then the United States will not embark on the path of destruction, and the world will also lead to peace, stability, and happiness. But the answer to this question cannot be found in Washington. It must be found in the lives of the American people.

<h3>New Light - Comparable to the Sun</h3>
<p>New York, Western Union Telegraph Agency – Recently, the Western Union Telegraph Agency in New York conducted an experiment and found a tiny spot of light whose luminosity is equal to one-sixteenth of the sun's luminosity, and this luminosity can quickly develop to half of the sun's luminosity. This tiny spot of light is emitted from a molten metal crater only three-thousandths of an inch in diameter. All the instruments are only as large as the smallest vacuum tube in a receiver, and the intensity of the emitted light is so strong that the darkest glasses must be worn to look at it directly.</p>
<p>This extremely high luminosity may solve the difficulties in optical microscope research, determine new standards for movie brightness, and make photo enlargements clearer. The inventor calls it the "condensed arc lamp." Ordinary artificial light is generated by heating filaments, arcs, or combustion of easily flammable substances in a vacuum, but this "condensation" acts as a generator. The generating power of ordinary light sources is limited by the melting point of metal wires or other substances. But this new light, when the illuminant—zirconium—emits light, makes it continue to be digitized, thereby increasing its luminosity.</p>
<p>The discoverers used this new light for various experiments. The first experiment shone this light in a 40-foot-wide room, allowing objects to pass through this light and project onto a screen. As a result, the outer edge of the light was medically paroled without jagged edges. The second was photographic magnification. Half of the photo was enlarged using ordinary methods, and half was enlarged using this new light. As a result, the back half of the enlarged photo was extremely clear, and even every leaf on the tree could be counted.</p>
<p>According to the engineer in charge of this experiment, the light emitted by this new lamp is ten times brighter than ordinary tungsten incandescent lamps, i.e., 65,000 candlepower per square foot. Using these new lamps to project movies can reduce power consumption and make the image clearer. Therefore, it will definitely make a great contribution to television broadcasting in the future. In addition, using this condensed light wire of the zirconium lamp can also increase the magnification of the microscope.</p>
<p>The basic structure of this new lamp is two inductive electrode devices installed in a glass bulb. After the air is evacuated, inert gases such as argon are introduced. One end of the electrode is coated with a small amount of zirconium oxide. After the power is turned on, the zirconium melts and emits light. As the temperature increases, the amount of light also increases. This lamp generates less heat, but the amount of light is greater. The part of electrical energy converted into light is more than the part converted into heat. Therefore, this lamp uses less electricity and has strong light. In addition, the application of this light wire to optical work can reduce the shortcomings of lenses and increase light transmission and magnification. The invention of this new light will add a unique brilliance to the future optical world.</p>
<h3>The United States is Prepared to Deal with Bacterial Warfare - Translated from Collier's Magazine by Jia Nan</h3>
<p>According to newspaper reports, the United States has discovered a white and sharp bacterial crystal that is extremely toxic, and every ounce can kill 200 million people. If the truth is indeed so, then the atomic bomb, which is second to none in modern military equipment, will have to give way!</p>
<p>The June 15th issue of "Collier's" magazine contained an article about "bacterial warfare." The author, Xia Leide, constructed an extremely terrible imaginary picture of this new war. Now, I will abridge the main points below:</p>
<p>Suppose that on the morning of December 5, 1958, an American named Smith suddenly died in a New York hospital. The situation before his death was very painful. He coughed up a lot of blood in his cough. The doctor diagnosed him as suffering from the "Black Death," which was extremely widespread and killed countless people in the 14th century. But the United States has not had this disease for fifteen years. This really stunned American medical scientists!</p>
<p>Suppose again that during this period, the international situation has undergone drastic changes. The envoys of the new Axis countries have just returned home because negotiations with the State Department have become deadlocked. Some observers believe that war may break out at any time, and the enemy country will launch an attack with weapons such as atomic rockets. Other observers believe that this is impossible because no country can use radioactive materials for war under the strict supervision of the United Nations.</p>
<p>On that day, another person in New York died of the Black Death, and patients in various hospitals were found to have symptoms of the Black Death. The next day, six more people died inexplicably, and similar bad news came from Miami, San Francisco, and Detroit.</p>
<p>In an instant, all kinds of epidemics broke out in the United States, coming on fiercely. Workers in the underground laboratories and arsenals built by the government at a cost of 100 million US dollars under the New Mexico desert were falling ill with dangerous infectious diseases.</p>
<p>If this really happened in 1958, it would mean that the Third World War has already begun. The development of the situation exceeded the expectations of ordinary military experts. It turned out that the first thing to come out and dedicate itself was not the atomic bomb but bacterial warfare.</p>
<p>The enemy does not need atomic bombs. When the offensive lands on the two coasts of the United States on the seventh day after the war, they will find that the American troops are vomiting and having diarrhea, and the civilians in the city are too weak to rise up and defend their families. The bridgehead is thus established.</p>
<p>Everything mentioned above is an imaginary picture, describing the misfortune that the United States may encounter if the Third World War breaks out. Fortunately, during World War II, the United States had a wealth of knowledge about the nature of bacteria in order to prevent enemy ambushes. Even if the enemy wanted to use bacteria to attack us, they would have to consider the seriousness of the consequences and the revenge of the United States.</p>
<p>Bacterial warfare is a relatively slow thing. It cannot immediately put a country to death. If the attacked country is prepared, she can also "fight back with tooth and nail." The United States is prepared and has more abundant knowledge of bacterial warfare. Not only can it defend itself, but it can also launch an attack when necessary, dealing with it with more severe measures.</p>
<p>However, most people agree that bacterial warfare is a truly serious threat. This thing, any "small" country can secretly manufacture, turning university laboratories and even wineries into factories for cultivating toxic bacteria.</p>
<p>So, will bacterial warfare really happen? Rear Admiral Smith, Director of the U.S. Military Medical Department, believes that bacterial warfare is really beyond the scope of human control and is equally dangerous to both aggressors and those who are invaded. Unless the enemy is desperate, they may not resort to this tactic.</p>
<p>However, one point is extremely worthy of consideration, that is, the cost of bacterial warfare is relatively low. For example, the United States once spent 200 million US dollars to manufacture atomic bombs, but studying bacteria does not require such a huge amount of money. Therefore, countries that cannot afford atomic bombs have the possibility of trying it out.</p>

<h3>Free Talk - Remaining in the Air - By Shao Fu</h3>
<p>Some time ago, plane accidents happened constantly. The Pan Xiaomeng family took a China National Aviation Corporation plane and disappeared without a trace, and there is still no news. Dai Li and his party took a military plane and crashed into a mountain, and the people and plane were destroyed. Therefore, some people who board planes cannot help but hold their breath in fear. Several important people specify that they will only take four-engine planes, reasoning that even if two engines break down, there are still two that can fly.</p>
<p>Friends in the air force often say: Unless necessary, it is best to fly as little as possible. Maybe you fly a hundred times without incident, but once something happens, it's all over. The reasoning is of course very correct. The ancient saying "A son of a wealthy family does not sit under a leaning hall" cannot be compared to this, but self-preservation is the same. I am not an anti-science diehard, and the record of flight accidents today is only about four or five per thousand. However, because airplanes travel in the vast and boundless sky, without any support or reliance, and can disappear without a trace in a minute or a second, it always seems that the risk is very high.</p>
<p>I remember that there was a celebrity who was a scientist and studied abroad. He never took airplanes. When people asked him why, he replied: Unless the airplane can stay in the air. At the time, this answer seemed like a joke, like a myth. On closer thought, airplanes should indeed make progress.</p>
<p>Not long ago, it was proven that this gentleman's words were by no means impossible fantasy. Please see—</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 27th] According to the Department of the Navy, a new type of American fighter jet is about to be launched that can stay in the air in a straight line. Its model is completely different from existing airplanes. The length of the wings is equal to the frame, and it is extremely fluid. Only two pilots are needed to keep the airplane in the air without falling.</p>
<p>In a few more years, flying in the air will be just like cars on the road. If there is a problem, you can stop and repair it before flying again. What danger is there then!</p>
<p>Science itself represents progress, and the word "unimaginable" will definitely disappear in the future!</p>
<h3>Inferiority - By Ge Shangde</h3>
<p>"Inferiority" is like a chain, tightly binding me, making me unable to move at all. In the face of the churning waves, I feel my insignificance. In the face of dedicated scholars, I feel my emptiness. In the face of vigorous young people, I feel my dullness. In short, I am ashamed of my appearance and know that in nature and society, there is nothing to be proud of. Therefore, I have no choice but to feel inferior.</p>
<p>Speaking of pride, really, I also had a period of self-pride several years ago. I was once proud of having written and translated several single-volume books, proud of having sat on the Queen and President and eaten seawater, proud of having stepped on the lecture hall of the university, and even proud of having married a gentle wife and formed a happy little family. But, I don't know when, "inferiority" began to break into my heart and constantly expand its territory. Now, my entire heart has become the realm occupied by "inferiority." Of course, the expansion process of "inferiority" and the reduction process of "pride" are directly proportional—on the one hand, the rapid growth of "inferiority," and on the other hand, the rapid disappearance of "pride."</p>
<p>That is to say, I have a rather significant difference in character from others. (Of course, this may just be my assumption. There may be, or even many, people in the world with the same character as me.) Others have sweet and beautiful memories in their minds. Even if the "subject matter" of this memory, that is, the so-called "past," is bitter and ugly, they will change it into sweetness and beauty under the mood of "nostalgia." As for me, Heaven did not give me this special talent. On the contrary, the various "achievements" that I used to be proud of have now become illusory in retrospect.</p>
<p>I understand that my translations are only the accumulation of soulless lead words that have been rearranged. I understand that eating seawater is not a synonym for the pursuit of knowledge. I understand that stepping on the lecture hall of the university is only the opening of a phonograph. I understand that a small family without an economic foundation will eventually be attacked by poverty. Therefore, I have become a prisoner of "inferiority."</p>
<p>Now, not only do I think of myself as an inferior person, but even close friends think of me as an inferior person. (It must be noted that he and I have been separated for more than ten years. He has not seen the process of my self-pride turning into self-inferiority.)</p>
<p>One day, a friend introduced me to visit a senior I had long admired. After more than ten minutes of conversation, my friend and I excused ourselves and left together. On the way, my friend said to me like this:</p>
<p>"Your attitude just now was too cramped. You only sat on half of the sofa, your body was leaning too much, and you were constantly scratching your head."</p>
<p>My friend's criticism was very pertinent. His words were like a clear mirror. In this mirror, a clear image of my inferior self and my inferior posture was reflected. I couldn't help but ask my image, "Hey! Is that you, me?"</p>
<p>Today, I finally discovered the strict boundary between humility and inferiority: humility can win people's respect, while inferiority, at most, can only win people's pity.</p>
<p>I want to break free from the shackles of "inferiority."</p>
<h3>Needs Stimulation - By Yang Mou</h3>
<p>A cup of strong black tea, or a cold ice cream, how much is that worth savoring? Wouldn't the spirit also be refreshed by it? However, a cup of plain boiled water, especially when swallowed in a daze, even when you are most thirsty, often feels like a waste. Without stimulation, it will never arouse love and nostalgia. Once swallowed, everything seems to be over.</p>
<p>That's what I think, and maybe it's just my prejudice. But how can a person living in the world have likes and dislikes? Knowing that it is a poison, you may have to drink it with a frown sometimes. Always pulling the sail with the wind, like a sailing boat sailing in the sea, I don't think it's very possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hate, I hate, lukewarm boiled water, it is just an emotional protest, but don't I still drink it all the time? What can I do? I think,</p>
<p>I also hate a lukewarm, boiled-water-like life.</p>
<p>However, among the partners around me, it seems that they have all been infected with the infectious disease of boiled water. They seem to take boiled water as the center of their lives to develop their philosophy of life.</p>
<p>For example, if you have something to find him for, he will not refuse categorically, nor will he fully promise, just vaguely affirming and denying, saying yes and no, and after talking for a day, there is no result. Next is handling procedures, doing official business, procrastinating, or pulling out some seven-pointed and eight-branching relationships, always trying to put out a fire with water from afar, as if slow movement is not</p>
<h3>Piteous Pleas and Desperate Bows: Hospital Doors Swamped with Crowds; Be Cautious in Daily Diet, Lest You Cling to Buddha's Feet at the Last Moment</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Due to the recent intense heat in the city, the epidemic is increasingly rampant, spreading at a speed unseen since the Anti-Japanese War. All infectious disease hospitals in the city are experiencing overcrowding, with latecomers finding no room. Until ten days ago, those suffering were mostly from the lower classes, but in recent days, it is not uncommon to see middle and upper-class families infected. Yesterday, when reporters visited various epidemic hospitals, they witnessed each hospital working with extreme tension, with patients being sent in like a tidal wave, day and night, resembling frontline battlefield hospitals. Not only were all wards long since full, but also the corridors and waiting rooms were filled with canvas beds and rattan chairs, sleeping with patients. The West Tibet Road Epidemic Hospital was particularly busy, unable to cope. According to the hospital's doctors, the hospital has received more than four or five times the number of original beds, and the other hospitals are also overflowing. If the government and local figures do not immediately find ways to respond, there is a real fear that the epidemic will become unmanageable. At one o'clock last night, reporters personally witnessed several critically ill patients being sent to the hospital, but within an hour, because the doctors and nurses were too busy, they could not be immediately accommodated for diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, there were even those who were sent to other epidemic hospitals, but due to lack of space, they were sent back to the west and pleaded desperately, begging to be admitted and treated, a situation of misery unprecedented. It is understood that currently, there are as many as seven or eight public and private hospitals in Shanghai that are accepting epidemic patients, but they are still unable to cope. The Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan, in order to help the authorities to eliminate the cholera epidemic, has partnered with the Municipal Health Bureau to add 400 temporary beds in the Zhongshan Hospital in the area. In addition to a small number of canvas beds provided by the Health Bureau, the remaining beds and all the necessary supplies will be provided by the office. It is expected that the beds will be open to receive patients within this week. At the same time, the Health Bureau, in view of the intensity of the epidemic, is also planning other emergency response measures to ensure the public safety of the city.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Approves Epidemic Prevention Funds</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Epidemic Prevention Committee issued a public notice: yesterday, there were 76 new cases of cholera, with 8 deaths, bringing the total to 966 cases and 74 deaths.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has approved a temporary epidemic prevention fund of over 440 million yuan for the period of July to October, which will be paid by emergency order. The funds for July, over 240 million yuan, will be allocated tomorrow for water well disinfection teams, fly eradication teams, the establishment of additional isolation beds, and the construction of mobile wooden houses.</p>
<p>The Nan Shi People's Hospital at 775 Minguo Road will begin accepting epidemic patients from July 1st. The extremely poor will receive completely free medical treatment, hospitalization, etc., with consultations available day and night. Telephone: (02) 70213.</p>
<p>Wang Shengchang, a local notable from Xujiahui, is organizing free clinics and medicine distribution, starting July 3rd. Poor patients from near and far are welcome to seek medical attention.</p>
<h3>Dramatic Prison Escapee Captured: Flown to the Capital Under Escort</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Zheng Changqu, Chief of the Lower Pudong Investigation Office of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, led his staff to Shanghai the day before yesterday to cooperate with the military and police authorities of this city in apprehending Zhang Rongqing and other dramatic prison escapees from Nanjing. Finally, at dawn yesterday morning, Huang Xinfa (aka Xinghai), Xie Ronghua (aka Zhang Rongqing), and Chen Yunqing were arrested successively at No. 128 Zhaofang Lane in South Shanghai and other locations. Two Mauser pistols were also found in Zhang's residence and confiscated immediately. Two hours later, Shen Deheng, Chief of the Yimiao Sub-bureau, received a tip-off that there were illegally hidden firearms at No. 128 Police Lane. He led Section Chief Guo, Officer Cui, and Chen Wanfu and Chen Yuzhi to search the premises. They happened to find Zhang's wife, Zhou Jinfeng, searching between the toilet for two gun parts and a Mauser pistol, along with 73 bullets. She was just about to report to the authorities, so the witness was taken to the bureau, and Chief Zheng was notified to confiscate the firearms. It was found that Zhang and others were originally company and platoon leaders of the Central Tax Police Regiment of the puppet regime, and later joined the Danyang Security Team. After escaping from Nanjing, they specialized in robbing passengers and merchants of their belongings on trains and automobiles along the Nanjing-Wuhu highway. After being recaptured this time, it is reported that they were flown to the capital under escort by the authorities last night for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ke Credited for Contributions: Sentence Reduced by Two and a Half Years</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Zhang Ke, who once served as the Vice Minister of Propaganda and later founded the "Daguang" Weekly after leaving office, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the judgment stated: "Zhang Ke colluded with enemy countries and conspired to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment with deprivation of public rights for two years. All property will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Presiding Judge Liu Yugui explained that because the defendant founded "Daguang" Weekly after leaving office and disseminated ideas of resistance against Japan, he made contributions to the country, so the sentence was reduced by two and a half years. In addition, Ni Suofu, who opened a machine manufacturing plant, Lin Yifu (aka Lin Yifu), who manufactured firearms for use by enemy troops, and enemy spies Wang Mingqian, Jin Liansheng, Wu Quangen, and Lin Han, who were suspected of being traitors, are scheduled to be sentenced on July 9.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] Fu Qiangeng, Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Grain Trade Association, was tried yesterday. Fu, during his tenure as a standing committee member and accountant of the puppet Oil and Grain Control Association, borrowed huge sums of money from the puppet Central Reserve Bank, Mitsubishi, Zhengjin, Sumitomo banks to purchase miscellaneous grains from Anqing, Bengbu, and other places in collaboration with the enemy Kurimoto Toraji, with seven or eight tenths of the grain being used by the enemy military to manufacture alcohol. However, Fu denied participating in Kurimoto's grain purchase and tried his best to evade responsibility. In addition, Chen Fenghao, the puppet Taizhou chief, was accused of using his power to oppress the people; Cao Rong, a police officer of the Puppet Nanshi Police Sub-bureau, was accused of spying on military and political news and providing it to the enemy puppets; Yu Yiming, the consultant of the Puppet Central China Tobacco Allocation Group, and Li Chunrong and Huang Qingzhong, the inspectors of the Puppet Shanghai North Station Guard, were also suspected of being traitors. They were interrogated separately and their cases were adjourned for further interrogation.</p>
