<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕日來平市煤價如飛，黑市中煤塊每噸已漲至十五萬元，煤　黑市每百斤漲至四千元，此種飛漲現象，乃為來源不暢，及商人囤集居奇所造成·據悉，月前兩度大雨，門頭溝大部煤窰，均爲水淹，致每日僅產煤二百噸，較通常產　減少五分之四。而山西并陘煤礦，因渭河橋破壞，陽泉煤亦因正太路阻，雖煤積如山，亦無由運出，此外如後勤部在平儲集煤斤，亦當爲原因之一。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿八日電〕程潛上將談：武漢行轅管轄區內所有國軍，悉已遵照中央計劃，如期整編完竣。李先念所部不守和平協定信的，自本年六月廿七日開始暴動，經時兩月，殺人無數，鄂豫邊區民衆發出最慘痛之呼聲，嗣調集部隊，予以有效制止，各縣人民武力亦羣起自衛，李部業已全部瓦解。共軍竄擾災害最重之地區，業經加緊辦理急振，已蒙主席發給接收敵僞之剩餘物品及各兵站存糧，舊衣，分配於被災各縣。</p>
<h3>共軍加緊破壞鐵路　北寗路煤車出軌</h3>
<p>津浦平古各綫均有事故發生</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕交通界息：戰火擴大中，共軍破壞鐵路似亦加緊。昨夜今晨北寗，津浦，平古各錢均有事故，北寗路唐山南之田莊採莊間，與茶淀漢沽間之路基，皆被破壞甚劇，由唐山南開之煤車八輛，因此出軌，鐵甲車亦出軌，同時有共軍三百餘攻田莊，其北之唐坊車站附近集結共軍三千餘，似有毀路進攻企岡，津浦路之馬廠，今晨再遭共軍千餘之猛攻，其後尚無報吿。平津路勞之安次縣昨晚起被共軍攻擊甚烈，其後即情况不明。平古路之懷柔東南十八里，仙茶之國軍兩個　，昨晚亦　共軍包圍，迄今晨九時尚激　中。</p>
<p>〔中央社石家莊廿八日電〕石太路娘子　至陽泉間被共軍破壞之鐵路，自經路局飭工星夜搶修，廿七日已全部修復，原定二十八日試車，惟二十七日晨娘子關東共軍又將井陘南峪間二十四公里七百米處橋梁一座破壞，六十五公里處長達八十米之山洞一座炸塌，二十八日晨石家莊開出之客車，至井陘即行折返。</p>

<h3>司使接見周恩來　交換國府委會問題意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕馬歇爾特使廿七日返京後，即與司徒雷登大使長談，轉吿在牯與蔣主席交換之意見，　大使與周恩來談話之參考。廿八日下午四時，周恩來往訪大使，談一時半。據聞政府方面係　酌馬，司調處之意見，首先研討國府委員會問題，其在名額之分配方面，政府意見為國民黨佔　席，共產黨佔八席，民盟·靑年黨·社會賢達各佔四席，惟聞共產黨方面原堅持十席，並佔四十席之名額中有十四席為共產黨所控制，亦即足以保留三分之一否決權。司使與周恩來會　時，即以此意轉達周氏，藉作繼續商談之根據。廿八日晚據共黨代表團發言人稱：本日司。　　，僅就一般性問題交換意見。並稱：政府方面對周氏前提兩項意見未作具體答覆，至國府　　會一節，目前尚無法談及名額問題，且謂目前業已再陷入「拖的局面」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕馬使廿八日晨接見俞大維，談約一小時，定廿九日接見周恩來。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕此間　　英大使施　文，英首相軍事代表魏亞特將軍與加大使歐德倫少將，將參加　　工作，為中國和平而努力，惟記者向各有關權威方面探聽對上述傳說，咸未能予以證實。基　國權威人士廿八日接見記者時，竭力否認此說。渠以為英使來華不久，對中國情勢尚不頂　，似不致參與此項斡旋工作。至魏亞特與歐德倫，確曾與蔣主席晤談多次，但出而擔任調處工　，上述傳說或即由於此種建議所引起，渠並認爲：中國和平若有望，則有馬帥·司使之調處已足，無須再挽其他第三者上塲。（馬特使與美陸次商談處理美剩餘物資問題消息，請閱第二　）</p>

<p>問：部長　　馬·司新建議改組國民政府委員會，包含中共份子，此事成功之希望如何？國民政府委員會是否代替國防最高委員會？</p>
<p>彭部長答：擴大政府基礎，包容各黨派及無黨派分子，業經蔣主席於八月十四日宣布，國民政府委員會即代替國防最高委員會，但此事必須於和諧空氣中始能實現，且須中共積極合作，而不以談判爲拖延之工具。</p>
<p>問：部長是否認爲府委會改組可引導長久之和平？</p>
<p>彭部長答：政府不惜一切努力，以奠定永久之和平，國府委員會如能改組，將為達此目的之前進一步。</p>
<p>需要並非條件</p>
<p>問：政府是否可望撤回或減輕其五項條件？</p>
<p>彭部長答：所謂條件，僅爲因中共之攻擊行動與擴大地盤引起新局勢之後，爲恢復治安秩序之各種需要　此等需要，不能認爲政府之條件或要求，例如共軍最近突然在　海路發動大規模攻勢，佔據許多重要城市，在此種情形下，爲恢復常地之秩序，共軍之撤退，自屬需要，然中共　又宣傳爲政府之新條件或要求矣。</p>
<p>停戰須有誠意</p>
<p>問：關於中共書面宣布要求全面停戰及重開政治協商會議，尊見如何？</p>
<p>彭部長答：（一）關於全面停戰，自從正月下停戰令後，政府未曾下過攻擊令，此數月來只有中共不遵協議，不尊重調處，到處發動攻擊，擴大侵佔地區，以致禍亂蔓延，此可就今日共軍侵佔地區與一月間下停戰令時之情形兩相對照，即可證明，試觀中共最近正式發表之全而動員令，更可明瞭誰爲攻擊者，訛不停戰，是以今日停止衝突之關鍵，在乎中共是吾眞有誠意，是否願意撤回共全面動負令，並撤退若干已經構成和平威脅或阻碍交通之地區。中共一念轉移，即可立致和平，吾則任何宣傳不能掩盡天下人之耳目。</p>
<p>努力實施決議</p>
<p>（二）關於重開政協會議，政協對各項間題，不僅原則有所決定，即方案步驟，均已有詳盡之決議，現在問題祗在將已決議者見諸實行。蔣主席在八一四文吿中，宣示政府方針，甚爲明確，政府現時正在盡一切努力，使政協決議見諸實施，故目前問題在誠意實行，而不在無期談論。（三）關於擴大政府，八一四文吿已明示，擴大政府基礎，務須從速實現，此即表示國民政府之改組，務期依照原議，於國民大會舉行以前完成。此事一經實現，則各黨派共在政府機構之內，各種問題，不難於和諧精神下求得解決。（四）關於憲草，八一四日文吿中，關于憲草曾有薈萃各方而更好的意見一語，此點曾於政協閉會時即已有口頭聲明，憲草審議委員會之交換意見，亦即基於此種精神。</p>
<p>促成　大召開</p>
<p>（五）關於結束訓政，政府切望結束訓政，貫澈　政之決心，業已再四宣示，並在實際上盡力進行，只望某些黨派勿誤解曲解國家爲重，黨派爲輕，共矢精誠，促成國民大會之召開，則民主與和平兩大目標必可完成。</p>

<h3>米契爾式轟炸機　十一架已成廢鐵　江灣美軍人員昨予拆毀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在最近盛傳美國國外剩餘物資淸算委員會上海辦事處違法出售轟炸機的時候，駐屯江灣機塲之美國陸軍人員，突於昨晨將原已售與中央航空公可之8-25型米契爾式轟炸機十一架拆毀。據中央航空公司機航組主任陳文寬於親自赴江灣機埸視察後吿記者稱：「該項轟炸機原已不能飛翔，美方人員爲使其確實不能飛翔，復於廿八日晨將其用電火解割爲二，首尾不能相連。唯機中零件·無綫電·儀器等件，按合同戰明，仍完整可用，將由本公司派員陸續拆除，而廢機亦仍可作爲廢鐵應用。」</p>
<p>中央航空公司爲使外界明瞭購機眞相，並明示所購飛機已不適用於軍事任務計，原定昨晨十時招待各報記者往江灣實地觀察。詎知記者十餘人乘中央公司卡車到達後，忽爲守衛機塲之憲兵所阻止，未許人內。其理由爲「會獲緊急命令」。唯據陳文寬主任之解釋，此項誤會起因於事前未有充分之接洽。陳之原意係將集合於大陸報館之各報記者接往龍華，由龍華機塲搭飛機飛往江灣，以免門前繁衛美憲兵未明原由，遽予阻止。乃卡車司機誤將記者等直接送往江灣，遂仍被阻擋於機塲外首。陳文寬於午後獲悉後，當即親自駕機飛赴江灣機塲，經用無綫電訊交涉。獲得許可後，降陸視察。據陳探詢結果，該處美軍方面警衛負責人謂，事實上極願記者參觀，前情諒係門崗之誤會等語。常時陳所見者即爲轟炸機之殘骸一堆。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國對華政策要改變嗎？</h3>
<p>美國以剩餘物資售於中國，竟引起中共的叫囂與抗議，並稱在這些剩餘物資內，「包括美國現存儲琉球菲律賓等地的作戰武器，彈藥，無綫電交通器材，以及其他各種配備。」道種虛構的「美麗謊言，」本來不値得一辯；但是美國是一個民主的國家，對此不得不發表聲明，予以否認。美國陸决裴特森與國務院國外淸理專員麥克布，昨天發表的聲明，已把環繞在這個問題四週的疑雲完全消除了。他們鄭重聲明，在售與中國政府的物資內，絕無軍火，武器，飛機以及其他軍用品；而此項剩餘物資，都是純粹民間使用之物品，對於中國之復與及和平時期的經濟，必大有裨益。中共聽了這個嚴正的聲明之後，不知還有什麽話好說？</p>
<p>戰後美國的國際政策，很明顯的建立在兩大基礎之上：第一是佔領德日兩國，以肅淸法西斯的餘孽，使其侵略勢力不復能東山再起；第二是擁護聯合國機購，使其成爲維持世界和平有效的工具，對於忠實履行聯合國憲章所規定之義務的國家，均願予以協助。論理美國在大戰結束之後，本不應該再以軍械售與他國，但是美國當周根據了上述的理由，仍舊以軍械售與英·法·中·菲律賓以及若干拉丁美洲各國。準此而論，在這一些售與中國的剩餘物資內，即使有軍械彈藥，和美國國際政策的基調，並無抵觸的地方。中共的叫囂及抗議，決不會左右美國的對華政策。所以美國代理國務卿艾契遜昨天用外交家的口吻說：「美國現行對華政策，是否將有所變更？此際尚不能發表。』</p>
<p>美國國務院中，頗多眼光遠大的外交家，一切政策與計劃，都是經過　密研究之後決定的，在推行政策的過程中，不論遭遇到何種困難與障礙，只有加倍努力貫激初衷，很少知難而改變的。以其對華政策而論，自從去年十二月間杜魯門總統發表聲明以來，迄無變化。不諭派遣馬歇爾特使來華調處國共爭議，或任命司徒雷登爲駐華大使，美國一貫的政策，乃在希望中國成爲統一的民主的强大的國家，可爲遠東唯一的安定力？對於維持遠東和平多盡些力，所以美國將西太平洋的剩餘物資售與中國，其眞正的用意，乃在協助中國的復興，但在別有心腸的中共，却認美國另有作用，乃發動宣傳攻勢，到處煽動人民起來反美，幸虧中國老百姓的眼睛雪亮，對於善惡，眞僞是非，黑白，以及利害，得失，却分別得很淸楚。所以我們站在老百姓的立場，再奉吿美國朝野，中共的叫囂反美，決不是我國四萬五千萬人民的公意；而全國人民對於美國以剩餘物資售與中國，協助我國復興建國，只知衷心感激，並希望此事早日完成，豈有反對之理！</p>
<p>伊斯蘭世界的動盪</p>
<p>在歐洲局勢動盪不寗，列强間關係一再緊張的今日，在近東方面亦復有烏製四合，山雨欲來的情勢。　　尼爾海峽問題，甫經提出，而鳥克蘭代表又有希臘危害巴爾幹和平的指斥，美南關係因美國一度有哀的美敦書的提出，幾使動盪不寗的歐局瀕於爆炸。現在這一聯串的歐洲問題迄未解決，而近東方面却又有新事態發展的黴象。將來這些新事態果將如何發展，我們雖不必臆測；但從近東方面傳來的消息，却頗使人隱慮。舊金山二十八日廣播，說伊朗內戰有於二周內爆發之可能，政府與阿日爾貝珍之談判已成僵局，由中東經近東至遠東全團民地區，無一片安樂土；由埃及至印度，全充滿火藥氣味，到處均有宗敎鬥爭與英蘇衝突。在伊朗的北部，蘇聯大軍雲集，同時英軍却進據南境，以其艦隊遊弋或停泊於波斯灣上·同時，伊拉克的寇特族，正與蘇方商談即擬成立寇特國，圖打通近東走廊，得由土耳其的韃靻尼爾打通到中東出海的白斯拉·</p>
<p>正在這個時候，英政府發表定九月儿日，與阿拉伯及猶太代表，在倫敦舉行會議，討論巴勒斯坦問題。英外部的宣布，謂已向阿族各國政府，巴勒斯坦猶太公會，及巴勒斯坦阿高級執委發出請柬，是此次會議雖爲討論巴勒斯坦問題，因阿族各國的均被邀請，無疑地，也可乖便討論一下近東的局勢·這裏値得我們注意的是據聯合社電訊，耶路撒冷大主敎戰時曾與希特勒等沆瀣一氣，爲英國所憎惡，英官方前曾公開聲明不願邀其參加；而巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級委員會却以爲該會主席耶路撒冷大主敎赫賽尼應爲代表之一，此項先決條件仍屬有效。這裏的所謂大主敎是伊斯蘭敎的一種　號，所謂「麻府第」（Mufti）此人是有各的赫賽尼（Haj　Amin　El　Husseini）在第一次世界大戰中，曾與英軍相呼應，樹起反抗土耳其的阿拉伯民族運動，到了第二次世界大戰，却對處反英。現在近東阿拉伯世界多事之會，說不定會得要像「麻府第」這種人物來聲援英國希望近東安定的企圖，更何况他在第一次世界大戰對於英國還有相當的貢獻。</p>
<p>從上面的記述，我們不難看出近東局勢是怎樣動盪不安。阿日爾貝珍及寇特族的建國運動，要與蘇聯商談，是其背後得莫斯科的　援，自不待言。旣然支持了寇特族，自必削弱以阿拉伯族爲中心的伊拉克；而伊拉克又是在英國的支持下而得到獨立的。在這個時候而有阿族各國代表集議於倫敦的邀請，當能增强阿族各國與英國關係·從而可知，在近東伊斯蘭世界裏，英蘇兩國如何在鈎心鬥角運用他們的智慧與手段來增强他們各自的地位。這種鬥爭，其實並不局限於近東伊朗，伊朗，伊拉克，土耳其，希臘，南斯拉夫，這些都是相聯貫的一串。</p>
<p>在過去莫索裏面尼曾經自命為「伊斯蘭的保護者；」希特勒也未能忘懷居住在富饒油區裏的阿拉伯人，且曾派他的副國務總理巴本爲駐土大使，以便與伊斯蘭世界裏的阿拉伯人發生更親密的關係，九如莫索里尼及希特勒都被擊潰了；但近東伊斯蘭世界裏的阿族國家還有富饒的油田，在蘇聯中央亞細亞存在有許多加盟於蘇聯的信奉伊斯蘭敎的民族國家。伊斯蘭世界，自印度以至北非，此後的局勢如何發展，實在値得我們的注意。</p>
<p>在印度，因爲眞納所領導的回敎聯盟拒絕參加尼赫魯所領導的臨時政府，此後回敎聯盟的態度如何，印度局勢如何發展，當爲關心印度局勢的人所注意·在伊朗，局勢的忽緊忽馳，也已有了相當的時候，這裏的問題終究還沒有解決；在伊拉克，有寇特族的建國運動；在土耳其，有韃靻尼爾海峽問題，在北非有義大利舊屬地的讓與問題，就是在突尼斯也有所謂「泛阿拉伯」運動份子的騷動。整個伊斯蘭世界是在動盪不安中，而在這動盪不安中，我們看見有伊朗內戰於二周內爆發的報導，英國有召開伯勒斯會議於倫敦，對阿族各國發出邀請的報導，將這些事件併合在一起，就可以看出它們背後國際關係的微妙複雜·這是在伊斯蘭世界我們看見有所謂「西歐集團」的利益與「反西歐集國」的利益的正面衝突。動　的伊斯蘭世界能够安定下來，整個世界纔能够安定·</p>

<h3>加速巴黎和平會議工作　四強外長今日會商　貝交外相昨自倫敦返巴黎</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕巴黎廿八日廣播：明日下午四時，美·蘇·英·法四强外長：貝爾納斯，莫洛托夫，貝文，及皮杜爾，將就和會目前所呈局面舉行會商。對美英方面之邀請，法國已於今晨以邀請三强在法外部會議之方式答覆，蘇聯之答覆已於週二提出。會議性質係「非正式」，此後應否再有同樣性質之集會則將由四强外長決定之。</p>
<p>倫敦廿八日廣播：英外相貝文今日下午抵達巴黎，佈置四强外長會議，因此次會議之召開，係由英國方面發動。會議地點將在英大使館或法國外交部。據聯合社電，四國外長會議之召集，係英外相員文徇加拿大總理之要求，乃向美國務卿貝爾納斯提出者。</p>
<p>據合衆社巴黎廿八日電、蘇外畏莫洛托夫已接受召開四强外長會議之建議，惟規定此次會義爲非正式性質，每一外長僅得隨帶專家二人。猶憶上次四强外長會議開會時，亦曾使用此種比較緊漢之方法，而使特里埃斯特問題，獲得妥協方案。此項會議對報界並不公開，但由於貝爾納斯之堅持，決定一切決議事後立即予以發表。</p>
<h3>審核對義和約草案　和會獲具體進展　義大利邊境數地區割讓與法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕今日和會在審核和約方面，獲得一月來第一個具體進展，對義政治委員會一致通過對義和的第一節，將阿爾卑斯山之聖貝那特山隘讓予法國。義國對於此點亦表同意。義代表薩拉蓋特聲稱，義國已正式同意將邊境四小地區割讓予法國，包登達與勃里茄在內。惟對於西尼斯高地，則要求大會修正四强之決議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕義代表團長薩拉蓋特，今日在和會中陳述意見，謂義國與聯合國共同作戰兩年，亦可功過相抵，義國竭力與法國恢復友誼，惟依照和平草的，修正法義籩界將使義國喪失西尼斯山·夏裴頓山·及洛夏流域，此在經濟及種族觀點上均不合理。薩氏致詞畢即離開會塲。</p>
<h3>澳洲代表撤回　設兩委會建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕今日美法英三國與蘇聯採取同一立塲，反對澳洲主張設立賠償委員會與國土變更特別審查委員會之建議，但三國對蘇聯代表團攻擊澳洲代表團以及責詢澳洲代表團動機之態度，加以斥責。澳洲代表鑒於上述建議必遭失敗，故將其撤回。因此四强對賠償與領土變革之協定，依然照原來形式保存於和的草案中。惟澳洲代表團保留將來詢問每一前敵國總共賠償若干之權利。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹阢隉不安聲中　美艦隊將訪希臘　駐泊愛琴海遙望土耳其　蘇駐希大使突奉召返國</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據路透社華盛頓電，美航空母艦「羅斯福」，將於九月五日至九日至希腦之埃庇魯斯港，作禮儀之訪問，隨行者萬噸巡艦「小石頭」號·　逐艦「康號紐」號及「柯里」號，同時美驅逐艦「諾亞」號及「華林頓」號，將訪問薩洛尼加。訪問希海港之美海軍指揮官，爲大西洋艦隊之母艦隊長卡賽第少將。「羅斯福」號於今日駛抵那不勒斯。又據聯合社電，美國已決定派遣艦隊訪問希腦，該處現爲蘇聯外交新攻勢之焦點。此種海軍實力之眩耀，官方仍名之爲「體義的訪問」，但外交界以爲此項美艦隊將駐泊愛琴海，遙望土耳其，與蘇聯所覬　共同保護之韃靻尼爾海峽人口，亦使一彈之遙。此舉又緊隨烏克蘭在聯合國安理會指控希腦爲巴爾幹和平危害者之後，其意義自益　然。</p>
<p>據合衆社雅典電，蘇駐希大使羅迭諾夫，廿八日請求希臘政府發給護照，俾偕同卷屬返國，據外交界解釋，此舉係奉政府召喚。希臘官方對於此項請求亦頗重視，因其適發生於星期日舉行帝國公民投票之前夕。其他方面袒白宣佈，羅迭諾夫之請求乃係蘇聯集團對希所施之一部分壓力，亦爲蘇聯可能不承認將由星期日公民投票產生之希臘帝制政府之先聲。</p>

<h3>土肥原曾陰謀佈置一切　將溥儀劫往東北　檢察官昨提出有關證件　紀爾出庭述日軍在滬毒化工作　浦東電力公司經理亦應傳作證</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿八日電〕今日國際法庭檢察官提出有關溥儀各謀。一九三一年十一月三日，天津總領事桑島致外相幣原電，報吿土肥原之談話，謂土肥原於二日夜晤見浦儀，吿以關東軍決擁立溥儀為　　皇帝，與日方締結攻守同盟，並吿以日皇室亦歡迎　義再起。溥儀似頗爲心動。十一月十三日，牛莊領事荒川致外相幣原密電稱：「據淡路丸船長稱：土肥原在津，秘密將溥儀由租界以汽車送往碼頭，復由携有機槍之軍隊警備，登上汽艇，開赴大沽，移乘淡路丸」。十一月十七日桑島致幣原電稱：「土肥原來津目的，係體關東軍之意，謀迅速擊出溥儀，打擊張學良之勢力，以爲滿洲獨立之前提。渠決心排除任何勸吿，即令違反國策，亦將由關東軍獨自採取自由行動」。一九三一年十一月廿六日，北平日使館參事官矢野致幣原電，報吿著名間諜川島芳子奉關東軍參謀板垣之命，秘密男裝來津，謀將「宣統皇后」帶往東北。十一月廿七日天津總領事致幣原電，報告軍方通知「宣統皇后」已於廿六日秘密脫出」，廿七日乘長山丸赴東北。各證件提供完畢，有關溥儀之審理乃吿一段落，繼傅英人佛蘭克，紀爾出庭作證。紀氏於一九三四年後任上海工部局警員，担任麻醉藥方面工作，現在上海英總領事館任職。紀氏陳述中日事變前鴉片被禁販賣，及汪逆傀儡政權成立，即破壞法令。其次傳上海浦東電力公司經理童壽民出庭作證，陳述日軍經濟侵略情形。</p>
<h3>謝米諾夫招認　曾與日勾結</h3>

<h3>澳向各關係國建議　設太平洋區會議　能否成功視美國態度而定</h3>

<h3>在蘇聯政府幕後　史達林大權獨攬　卜斯克雷皮希夫是他的耳目</h3>
<p>在最近的國際事件中，幾乎每一件事件都與蘇聯有關，這個北極之熊地位之重要，於此可見一斑，八月十九日泰晤雜誌登載一篇蘇聯國內政權概况的文章，茲特譯出，以　讀者。</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾經說過，「每一個能　能寫的人都能懂得蘇聯。」可是實際上呢？任何國家的政治組織，形式上和它的實在作風總是不同。這個分別在蘇聯，比在任何國家都大，因為蘇聯共產黨是蘇聯隱藏在背後的政府，它控制着名義上的蘇聯政府。</p>
<p>領袖握一切黨政軍大權的就是蘇聯的領袖史達林。紅軍就直接隸屬他的麾下。同時因爲有紅軍政治部的組織，共黨可以監視紅軍的行動。</p>
<p>史達林有他個人的秘書處由上月升級的卜斯克雷皮希夫將軍主持。他的職務也許最能說明蘇俄的作法。外國人去見史達林都碰到過他，因爲他就坐在史達林辦公室的外間—髮禿，身材小，看上去很像一個桶。史達林和列寗爭新的時候，組織他私人的秘書處。從此以後，這個秘書處就專事搜集，關於一般有反抗史達林可能的共產黨員的材料，在圈內的共黨，都背後叫這位將軍作「狼呑虎嚥的虱」。</p>
<p>按照蘇聯憲法權，是自下而上的，可是實際上，它却是自上向下的。所以這樣者，這隻領袖的虱正是原因之一。</p>
<p>黨目前共產黨員共六百萬人，比六年前多了三百五千萬人。他們選出全蘇共產黨大會，而由這大會產生出中央委員會，一共有七十一位委員，外加六十八名候補委員。在兩次大會的休會期間，就由此委員會指導一切黨務。屬於委員會之下的有三個機構：（一）政治局，十四人組成，一切內政外交國策都由他們決定，也許是世界土　最大的集團；（二）組織局，執行黨政的機關；（三）秘書處，主管組織局的機構。</p>
<p>國最高蘇維埃政府的兩議院是由一萬萬二百萬選民（蘇人口爲二萬萬）選定的。兩議院每年開兩次會。在開會的幾天裏，就看見這班議員鼔掌和一致　護。休會的時候他們的職務由主席團祖任執行。主席團由三十三人組成現任主席許維爾尼克爲共黨政治局會員之一</p>
<p>全蘇最高的行政管理機構則爲部長會議。現任的主席和八位副主席都是政治局的會員。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自市府佈告九月一日起取締攤版後，全市攤版五千餘人，於昨日上午九時許在溪口路（朱葆三路）集合，向市府聯合請願，至江西路經憲兵阻止，折向廣東路·河南路·民國路·中華路·方斜路·大吉路至公共體育塲集合。推代表劉儒林·蘇若非·李鴻如等三人，於十一時十五分至市府請求謁見市長，面選呈文。市長接見後，拒絕攤版之請求，認為攤販非小本經營，其資本有在千萬元以上者，且其貨物，頗多由碼頭倉庫盜竊而來，故不能考慮。下午三時，攤販代表三人又向警察局行政處請願，亦經拒絕。又市府決定取締全市攤販之前，曾接上海市商會八月二十日代電，原文稱：「查本年六月二十三日屬會召集第九居會員大會，據百貨南貨牙膏牙骨器鐵鍋陶器西服商業拍賣花樹商業等各公會聯名提出取締攤販建議，略謂：馬路設攤久在取締之列，旣失觀瞻，又碍衛生，近且以巨大資本經售走私或碼頭盜竊而來之大衆貨物品，對於營利所得各稅槪不繳納，實屬影響國家稅收，商店營業，請轉呈市政府嚴予取締各等情，經屬會據情轉呈，請予採納施行在案，迄今尚未奉批，用再電呈，仰祈鈞府准予俯准施行，實為公便，上海市商會叩號」。市府接此代電從，當即批示如下：電悉，查本市各處馬路攤販經決定於九月一日起除香烟書報零食攤販准在不妨碍交通地點擺設外，其餘一槪不准擅設，業於本月二十日佈告週知，並令警察局切實取締執行在案，合行批飭知照此批·吳市長在市政會議決定取締攤販以後，曾令警察局轉飭各分局自奉令之日起，即行逐日派員勸導該管分局內之各擻戶，限期改業，不得自誤。現據市府方面表示，對於取締本市擻販，必自九月一日起，嚴格勣行。</p>

<h3>二路公共汽車　更改路綫　經四川北路到北站</h3>
<p>本市公用局二路臨時公共汽車，原定行駛路綫係自老北門沿河南路至北火車站，但最近當局為改善中區交通，故將河南路改為單程交通，各種車輛祇准由北向南，不准由南向北。該公共汽車自不得不更改行駛路綫，即日起自老北門開車，經民國路，向北至天台路，經四川南路過四川路橋，沿四川北路革武進路，向西至河南北路，而達北火車站。如此更改以後，路錢培長不少，而欲至四川北路一帶者，亦大爲稱便，但當局為顧及趁客負担計，對車票暫不加價，全綫仍為二百元。</p>
<p>又頃自關係方而獲得確息：本市中正東舛西藏路至外灘之快慢車道，自即日起由工務局，公用局及警察局會銜公佈依照規定行駛，即機動車應在快車通上行駛，人力車，三輪車等應在慢車道上行駛。</p>
<h3>跋涉山川運來食監　衹落得虧本的下場　監商在苦悶處境中</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕俗語說得好：「走遍天下娘好，吃盡天下鹽好！」每天開門七件事中，監佔了第四位。一日三餐，都少不了監。人人吃鹽，家家用鹽，可是又有多少人，知道鹽的底細呢？</p>
<p>據若干盟商估計：本市月前每月對鹽的消耗量，是五萬祖左右。主要的消費者，是醬油坊，醃臘食品，鹹菜作等。一般電化工廠，都因外貨的傾銷而停工了。吾則，工業用鹽的數量相常的大，每月的消耗量，當也不止這邊巡的五萬担了！</p>
<p>原來，官私鹽的分別，只不過在納稅與否的一點上區別而已。納過稅的統稱官鹽。否則，就是私鹽。目前本市用的食　，大部是納過稅的官　。</p>
<p>目前官鹽主要的來源，有財政部上海鹽務處接收敵僞的一批溫台存　。據說這批鹽質地低劣，色澤黝黑，可是倉價每担也要一萬六千五百元。鹽務處的倉庫，一在浦柬，一在南市　瓜街。如果是浦東倉庫出貨的話，則每担到上海的價格，要超過一萬八千元了。據說：這批存鹽已快到配完的時候了。</p>
<p>外埠鹽的來源，有餘桃塲，表浦場，岱山場等處。此中以餘姚場的產量最豐，可惜缺少還輸工具，運銷為難。這幾個地方所產的鹽，都是細廳。進批鹽大多是就地征稅的。還有一批粗粒的淮魯流鹽，都是從山東和蘇北一帶來的。這批鹽的產區，十九在共軍的控制下。一般阪運商常採取物物交換方式掉　。通常是在鹽到了吳淞口之後，再行補稅進口。現在供應本市最多的，還是岱山和淮魯等地的來監。</p>
<p>據說餘姚表浦岱山各場產　的鹽本，每祖不過六千元。可是每担鹽稅，就要八千餘元，加上運雜費等到上海的價錢，每担已超過一萬七千元。再說淮務流鹽，鹽本的每担一萬一千元，到上海後要加稅六千餘元，每担也要合一萬七千五六百元。</p>
<p>說到私鹽，因為監警力無的不够，無快究全消滅。而且，數量也着實可觀。據說：這批私鹽，也是從各產鹽城漏稅私運出來的。可是也正因為是私鹽的關係，來滬的過程中，經過了重重「黑吃黑」的勒索敲詐。到上海的成木，每担也合到一萬二三千元。這批私鹽，大多在浦東一帶漫長的海灘邊上岸，由鹽販子收了運到市上來發賣。　向各地辦監來滬運銷的價格，旣然都站住在一萬八七千元一担的關口。而一方面上海鹽務處，又以一萬六千五百元一担的價格，無限配售。鹽商固可申請配給，醬油坊，醃臘作等，也可直接申請配給。這樣一來，却苦了　的運銷商，他們還憑什麼來盈利？跋涉山川，販來的鹽，却落得個虧木的下場。於是一個跟一個的停業不幹。在他們苦悶的處境中，他們存着一個憤憬，那就是希望　跋當局，對　價要有個合理的關整，特別是從抑抵鹽稅方面着手，使得鹽商還能吃到一口鱸飯，市民吃到一由廉價的　！</p>

<h3>兩同業公會獲密切合作</h3>
<p>又悉本市報關業同業公會理事長陳泮君，前日接到輪船業公會函請勸告各報關行勿再將本國商貨報運外國輪船，協同維護航權後，立即召集該業緊急會議，並由陳泮君偕梁冠吾，包海　，干子章，戴秉蠡等四人，同晤輪船業公會秘書李雲良，當由陳君對各報關行報裝英輪事，加以聲明，並謂各貨延滯將近一月，且大部均係糧食，北方糧荒孔亟，故急須北運接濟，報裝英輪，實屬出於無奈，並非不保護航權之謂，希望輪船業公會能與報關業公會合作，使各輪船公司予報關行以便利，自不致再裝外輪云。李氏謂對各輪船公司已屢决函告，憑密切合作，最後指示，所有貴生輪退貨，可改裝招商局貢興輪，中聯等公司國聯輪，以及復生輪，臨安輪等，月底前均可北運。至此輪船業公會與報關業同業公會之間，已獲致圓滿解決辦法，</p>

<h3>銀根奇緊環境惡劣　華洋股賣風大盛</h3>
<p>華股昨因銀根奇緊，軋多大盛，紗布帮爲應付紡建開出棉紗之頭寸起見，對華股不得不加放手，於是賣風頓起，逐漸下跌，晨初高價氷紗七三三元，美亞四四三〇元·景福二七〇元，新光二八八元，勸興二一〇元，開後賣戶紛紜，節節下降，近午都現低價，永紗六五五元，美亞三六五〇元，新光二三八元，景福二一八元，勤興一五五元，臨收稍回，各冷門中小型股亦被出籠所壓迫，述同元老股突告回跌，結果較前收計永紗回小一成弱，美亞景福新光各跌一成半，勸興亦跌二成光景，較冷各中小型股冋小一成至二成不等，元老股亦跌一成以上。</p>
<p>外股環境普遍惡劣，回跌亦多，各股開出即告慘降，供過於求，不易脫手，近午都現低價，結果較封關前計怡紗英聯亞洲回跌一成，會德　怡啤紙業各跌半成左右，鋼業業廣雖跌而不多。</p>
<h3>紡建變更配售辦法　紗布市價昨均回跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市反動而降，晨初即有當局將集中配售之傳說，是以人心發處，雙馬一度小至一百六十萬，旋以客帮收　而復升至一百六十九萬，收市廿支雜牌亦跟小十萬，十六支跌五七萬，獨四十二支狂瀉廿萬之　。午時紡雄公司照常平價　牌，承購者雖極爲踴躍，然配售額不敷甚巨，聞紡建當局爲防止有關各業囤購取巧起見，自本月廿九日起，改於上午十時掛牌，限　日繳付貸款云。</p>
<p>連日越升之布市，昨則稍有反動，因獲利者吐出，同時紡建公司自二十九日起，對於開售棉布棉紗之辦法改變方針，當日開進之紗布，限於翌日　銀提貨，延遲即當取消開貸資格，浮多一致了結，市盤乃下落，但客方銷費尚堪維持，因漸入旺銷時期，結果各布約跌一·二千元。</p>

<h3>煤市漸趨平穩</h3>
<p>煤市白煤槐漲勢已見緩和，同業通胃因連日市價上漲頗亘，無實銷者，不再購進，鴻基白煤層及烟煤等煤商業聯合營業處仍照常配售，且配價亦未變更，故市價亦始終平穩，木炭自經白煤塊及液體燃料火泊漲價後，各煤店門銷漸轉暢達，行市略見微升。</p>
<h3>麥爾登到銷兩旺</h3>

<h3>外滙率調整後　生絲出口尚難解決　浙省秋蠶飼育頗有希望</h3>
<p>本年絲廠業因本年收購春蘭製絲，成本高昂，而國外絲價反較我國產地價爲低，故絲業前途難以發展，均以外銷虧蝕甚重，不能裝　出口，多數絲廠或减少生產，即已製成之絲，亦堆存不願蝕本轍出，自政府調整外匯匯率及免除出口稅，公布實施後，對於絲廠業前途據絲綢業鉅子稱，按目前新匯率，生絲出口，相距成本尚逮，實際尚不能解決生絲之出口困難云。</p>
<p>又訊，浙省爲蠢絲區域，自外匯率變動後，生絲外銷有望，秋　即將開始，農民養蠶已有興趣，秋　九月初開開始飼育，二十日後可收繭，此次秋種，政府發有補貼，故蠶農成本减輕，本省現有秋種十八萬張，大部均由杭市，嘉興兩冷藏庫，分別領發，銷種區域浙西蠶區：佔百分之八十，浙東　區，佔百分之二十，估計　種每張收繭十五斤，共計可收鮮　二萬祖以上，每担規定以十二萬元計總値約爲二十四億元，於農村經濟，有相當裨益，聞秋期　農，多利用餘閒，飼育秋　，以數量有限，所需桑葉，多數均屬自給，成本减輕，故本届情形，與春　不同云。</p>

<h3>西北考察記</h3>
<p>— 高鍾潤</p>
<p>抗戰期間曾給我們有不少的轉變，不少的進步一　不被人們重視的問題，這次却被重視了；一向不易跨足的地方，這次也被跨足了，想不到生長在沿海地方的我，也有機會到內陸戈壁的原野裏漫遊，雖然交通百般的困難，但火時代給予我們的敎訓和認識，也能克服一切的艱巨，力求改進，做封人定勝天的地步。</p>
<p>好一個遼闊的西北！佔着个國疆土四分之一的地方，有着波流湍急滾滾不息的火河；有着綿亙千里崗　起伏的雄山·遺留着前人開發的殘跡，散布了千年古老的文化，一種說不出的純潔，混厚，偉大，開關，該受人們的欣賞和嘔歌！在這偉大的懷抱裏，又有千變萬化的蜃樓海市，牠原是虛幻的點綴，但這種虛幻，確給身歷其境的人們感到　般的安慰。在長寂的荒野中，風送着遠地裏的釘鈴聲，這原是任重致遠的駱駝，從瀚海裏安步前進·他們堅苦忍耐，以達成其爲役服勞的任務。沙漠裏的草兎，戈壁灘上的黃羊，在偉火無垠的荒漠裘，矯健而輕快的奔馳着，看來越發顯得自由，給人們有不少的激刺，可是常人們踏着那些駝馬牲畜的殘骸時，又不知覺的要憐惜起這般牲畜的身世，憑弔牠們爲人服役的辛勞。</p>
<p>西北的景色，受着自然環境的影響，自有許多和內地各省不同的地方，——人羣生活，社會動態，都表現着有奇特的樣兒，這種奇特，思來實在有興味，尤其是在事過境遷的時候，現在就公餘之暇追及往事，雖不免有今昔之感，但一個迢迢三萬多里的大西北旅行，確也不無有敍述的價値。</p>
<h3>蘭州的躍進</h3>
<p>在一個兩山夾一水的中間，圈覆着一座古老的城市——蘭州。牠雖比不過上海市這樣的金璧輝煌，但市面的繁熒，點綴得神氣活現！</p>
<p>城南的阜蘭山，雄峙而高聳，看來好似一扇屏風，山的低落處又稱五泉山，傳說是有「甘露，掏月，　子，蒙，惠」五個稱呼的泉，山間古樹扶疏，佛寺羅列，的是一個風景地區，但現在已不是一般普通人所可遊玩的塲所·同行有位軍事專家，趁機陪伴進山一遊，委實沾光不少。我們到了最高的一個亭閣裏，憑攔向北面看去，那狹長的蘭州，充滿着黃沙灰塵，沙塵在西北原屬普遍，但初次見着難免有點不慣。</p>
<p>黃河沿着蘭州城的北面走過，我們因爲來往行經的時候都是在冬寒的季節，雖滾滾洪流，也凍結如白練，這種在江南不易多見的景象，確給我們一個欣賞的機會。橫跨在黃河上的鎭遠鐵橋，便是溝通南北的唯一要津，牠好似上海的外白渡橋，用鋼架支撐着，但多年的磨折摧毁，未加修葺，已使牠慢慢的凋敝下去了。過了黃河鐵橋，便是白塔山，山上有不少的小廟，建築上較五泉山差多了。想來是在冬天，那滿山枯禿，寸草未長，呈現着一片黃枯的景色，確不能引起人們的美感。</p>
<p>新疆　頭回開的雜貨舖子倒還不少，牠們的招脾字號都含有思鄉之感。高昌·塔里木·阿爾泰·這原是新疆省的地名，在蘭州確成爲纏回較大店舖的招牌，表現着濃厚的鄉土意味的，不僅是那幾塊招脾，還有那名貴的土產，吐魯蕃的葡萄，哈密的瓜乾，庫車的包仁杏，和其他從新疆過來的洋貸。</p>
<p>甘肅的生產，受着天然的限制，棉紡織物原屬不多，但羊毛的取用便利，毛紡織在蘭州倒還發達，這是西北唯一的經濟資源，若能大量利用，未嘗不可解救人民衣着的問題，在蘭州，工業，醫藥事業和敎育等等。都好像在埋頭苦幹，向前邁進，這種力量的發揮，使古老的蘭州市，加添了不少新生的氣象，「西北重鎭」，義不容辭，蘭州，好一個古老的城市！在過去的八年抗戰中，牠已經担負起建設的責任了！</p>
<h3>甘新大道</h3>
<p>是一個帶着濃冬意味的初春淸晨，東方剛透露出一片魚肚色，大地睜開了惺忪的睡眼，崢嶸古老的蘭州，籠罩在曉風宿霧之中，原有一種不可名狀的靜肅，但不一會却被嗚鳴的汽笛聲衝破。呀！籌備已久濟濟多才的西北考察團，從這個晨光曦微的當兒，發動了事先準備的長途旅行汽車，告別蘭州，開始西行。</p>
<p>包羅着交通水利農田軍事醫藥和社會地理等方面的人才所組織的西北考察團，一行十六人，乘只長形的轎車，踏上了征塵，和甘新公路結了一年多的緣，牠原是左宗棠去新疆的火路，路旁仍可看出不少的楊柳，相傳是左公西征時所栽，有詩「大將西征尚未還，湖湘子弟滿天山，新栽楊柳三千里，引得春風度玉關」，讚美着左公的功績，後人爲紀念他的功績，稱那些楊柳爲「左公柳」，在荒枯滿目的廣漠裏，有幾株柳樹點級着，確予人們有不少的快慰和興奮。</p>
<p>這條溝通西北的唯一大道，隨着抗戰引起人們的注意，其實在兩千年前，已是中外交通命脈的所在，牠曾溝通過東西的文化，調和過各宗族的感情，交換過不少的物資……現在牠的任務仍見重要，這種含有國際性的大道，該受人們的重視，保護，扶植和開發，是一個刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>河西走廊是一個狹長的地形，東西伸長，南北因爲受着祁連山和北山的天然限制，不能舒展，形成狹窄，牠好像橫放的啞鈴，又好像一棍骨頭，兩端凸出中部細狹，甘新大道便是順應着自然環境的形勢蔓延着，這裏有不少的漢唐遺跡，雖然往事如烟，究不失爲考古上的資料·漢唐時代的西河四郡——武威（凉州），張掖（甘州），酒泉（肅州），敦煌（瓜州），便是左右於大道的二側，由武威到張被的一段，大都是天然戈壁，在建築工程上，支付的代價較少，從張掖到酒泉，路面多舖卵石，雖戈壁灘上到處都是這些材料，但能夠齊齊整整的敷設成路，該是人們的血汗壘成，據說敷路的時候，曾策動過大隊的士兵，用他們的軍帽，從遠處拾來此較大的石塊，舖設成長的大道，這種勞動服務，實在偉大，走在這大道上的人們，能不感謝！一出嘉峪關，景色更見荒凉，給養尤加困難，而用軍帽拾石敷路的功績，更見偉大了。</p>
<p>甘新公路經過的地方，不都是在平衍的戈壁上，有時也從祁連山的沖積扇面（山麓的扇形地帶）上經過，可是這些地方，一到雪融冰解，山洪暴發的時候，會把公路衝毁，這種情形在新疆天山南麓的公路上也數見不鮮，所以在一段路面上，少不得支架木橋，以便洪流從橋下通過，對於公路少受傷害，但建造橋樑的材料，大都取之於公路兩旁的「左公柳」，割前人植樹的遺愛，成當今築路的大業，雖則一方有益，一方有損，但就成就上看來，同有不朽的價値。</p>
<h3>風雪抵永登</h3>
<p>當考察團離開蘭州向西進發，正到了河口的時候，有一輛汽車的水管爆裂。幸兒我們準備着一封公函，對於車輛發生問題·可以就地向公路車站接洽修理，這確是方便得多，趁着修車的當兒，我們看出河口便是莊浪河與黃河交會的口子，河口的得名定是從此而來，在黃河的岸邊，看見那上流帶下的浮冰，一片一片的飄浮東流·近岸的水車，已早被冰雪封結不稍轉動，田野是一片枯黃，人們關門蔽戶拱手取暖，這原是初春的天氣，但在北方仍帶有凜冬的意味。</p>
<p>這時太陽懶洋洋的向西方斜下，天空已滿布暮色，風在吼，樹在動，一時沙　漲漫，昏暗莫辨，同伴有的上車靜待，有的鑽進店家取暖，當晚車抵永登縣城，天空鵝片似的雪花，正飄飄下降。</p>
<p>北方的雪好似江南的雨，說得少些，一下可三四天，我們的行程爲雪阻滯了，一天無事，向縣府借了十多匹馬來試騎，因爲西北的交通工具，是以牲畜爲主，其中最輕便更易辦到的是馬，此去西北生活，騎馬要占一部份，趁時得先練習練習。</p>
<p>在一個小型的縣城裏，戶兒家不多，市面又很冷落，忽然有十多騎行，走在窄狹的街道上，自會引人注意，騎馬不是一件容易的事，會騎馬的人不一定能保險不出岔子，何况不會騎馬哩，大家本了一個小心謹愼的原則，不圖快跑，慢慢前進，走不好遠，一位慣於騎馬的同伴不耐煩的說道，這樣慢法好像狀元遊街，和着一片笑聲，另一位不善於騎馬的同伴應聲抗辯，該罰！在這民國的時代，那來狀元，你的頭腦還有些封建遺毒……。</p>
<p>在快樂的塲合裏，總覺得時光過得太快，談笑聲，馬蹄聲，聲聲送進老滿城。原來永登縣有兩座城，一是漢城，又稱新城，商店和機關都在那裏，一是滿城又稱舊城，在淸朝是一班領恩餉的旗人所住的地方，現在城裏荒蕪不堪，僅城角一隅，住只幾家滿人，想當年他們是「皇淸世家」，現在確一貧如洗，流爲乞丐，回馬歸還處，仍不免有富貴浮雲之感。</p>
<h3>爬過鳥紗嶺</h3>
<p>—從永登西行，大的走了六十九公里，便爬行崢嶸畸嶇的山路，這是從蘭州出發以來，所經過的第一高山，山名烏紗嶺。海拔高度約三千公尺，牠原不算十分的高大，但在我們行經的時候，冬意仍濃，看得滿山積雪，不由得不想牠是一個高地·甘新公路由牠的腰間通過，汽車行駛，雖不十分困難，但宛延迤邐，盤轉曲折，確給行路人有困惱之感。</p>
<p>山頂有座破廟，據說是韓湘子廟，裏面住着幾個道士，伴着他們的是幾個士兵，士兵到這裏來不是無因的，他們若莫有特殊的任務，決不會到那高寒的山上去玩要玩要。</p>
<p>道士們實在可憐，在這高寒的山上，土地雖說不少，但無挑種的價値，他們的生活，全靠化緣吃飯，有時也能收得一點香火錢。說來奇怪，韓湘子的威靈到也够大，在那荒山之巔，居然也能博得附近鄉民的信奉，就是往來的行商，也得去燒一柱香，抽一枝籤，很虔誠的懇求韓湘子指示他們的迷津，和發財的路徑·當我們遊息在那二進共六間的破廟裏，隨便觀望的時候，看見一個汽車夫在求籤，當他看見我們的時候，他很大方的說道：「你們也來求根籤，這裏的籤是很靈的」。</p>
<p>從韓湘子廟向西行，便是下坡路，道時汽車也好似一個有知覺的動物，不費氣力似的向下坡溜着。不一會到了古浪，縣城建築在山坡上，公路沿着山腳走進。這裏的街市房屋都很簡陋。據說在民國十九年的時候，甘肅遭了一决大地震，古浪縣便是因爲那决的地震，慘遭不幸的摧毁。現在往來的行車較多。公路的兩側，添建了幾家飯舖，在那荒寂的環境中。祁連山好似一列屏風，分隔了甘靑兩省，造成了甘肅省特殊的地理位置——狹而長。從此西去，平衍千里，廣漠無垠，醒示着人們——漢唐河西四郡，便從此起點。</p>
<h3>武威</h3>
<p>— 古凉州</p>
<p>武威——古凉州，是漢時河西四郡之一，東距蘭州的二百七十公里。自別離蘭州直向西方進發以來，牠算得上是甘肅走廊裏的第一個重鎭了。全境面積東西長的一百九十來里，南北關約一百四十里。據該縣卅二年的調查，人口有卅四萬，這個數字在當時也算得上是河西各縣的首位。</p>
<p>顧名思意，武威好像是在耀武而揚威。當我們還不曾踏進牠的地盤時，聽得這個窮凶活現的名字，無不憧憬着那副面孔畢竟是怎樣的恐怖，怎樣的令人害怕，其實宣傳總是宣傳，事實才眞是事實，在我們瞧見那籠罩在光天化日之下的那座古色的城垣時，不覺對牠起了一種親切偷快的感動，牠並不像牠的名稱那樣的可怕，反倒愈發的顯得牠的秀麗繫昌，當然牠的秀麗抵不上西湖；牠的繁昌遠遜了上海，但在地　民貧的甘肅說來，算得上是一等地方。</p>
<p>城內寬敞而整潔的馬路，陪襯着有條不紊的建築，正表現着地方上的市政在進步，這裏許多較大的店鋪，都是在黑漆大門裏開設着，從大門進去，兩旁都是整整齊齊的櫃台，打門格子窗門，跳進櫃台，他們便站在崗位上，問你要買什麼，這便是交易買　的方法，當我們走過武威的時候，對於這些黑漆門高的商肆，總覺得他們是很淸閒，是很優過，好像生意做與不做，都滿不在乎。原因是他們多半僅開半天的門，做半天生意，所謂半天，又不過僅是三兩個鐘點，想來他們是何等的安閒舒適，覺得自己像優牛似的向那人烟稀少廣漠無垠的寂寞大地裏奔走，是何等的辛勞，又是爲誰去辛勞！</p>
<p>我們因爲要從武威向北進發，到民勤縣去考察，所以在此稍事兜留以作準備，因之武威城裘城外，都作過短時間的遊覽，就風景區說，北城外的平苑，到覺得淸雅，據說主人馬××，在興建的當兒，從一草一木培植起來，如今園子裘的樹木在和空間爭長，愈發顯得靑葱蒼鬱，那花兒草兒也都擺蕩在輕風之下，似乎稱耀着牠們的自由自在，但園子的主人，因爲換了新的環境，早已離開這幽美的境地走了，空留着幾座亭台，幾所房屋，和老態龍鍾的園丁，因爲沒有督促的壓力，那園子已是荒蕪了，我們雖是天涯游子，信步而至，對於牠毫無一點關係，但觸景傷感，不免有人去樓空之嘆，想來人生時時在求享受，而享受也得有機遇的，一時的享受，固然可以安慰那沉迷的靈魂，靜地裏思來，又回嘗不是富貴浮雲哩？</p>
<p>城裏靠近東門不遠，原有一個海子—湖，旁邊建有二座廟—大雲寺和慶雲寺，寺裏原有兩座塔，可惜那富有佛敎藝術的塲所·竟在民國十六年四月十二那天，遭了地震，塔是倒了，寺是毁了，海子也乾了，陪着塔寺的傾覆，喪失了許多人命，也許他們是和寺院裏的菩薩，同時升天罷！說也奇怪，在離開傾禤的寺院的模幾丈遠的一座鐘樓，地震時倒不曾波及，現在依然矗立着，尤其在那錢峨的寺院和高聳的佛塔遭了浩劫之後，越發顯得雄壯而偉大，鐘樓高有五六丈，建築的樣兒像是一個碉堡，從邊門上去，又好似攀登城樓，上了城樓，有兩層，底傍有碑一方，上層縣鐘一座，鐘上的紋彩別緻，上雕爲天女形式，若以敦煌千佛洞所見的壁畫，來測度那鐘，當爲唐代的遺物，可是看了下面暗淡模糊的碑文，又像是記載前凉王張氏用五金所鑄成，王張氏何以要鑄那座鐘，又何以用五金來鑄，這原是如烟似的往事，已飄渺無據，總之那座鐘的年代是相當的古老，這是無疑的。</p>
<p>城南的文廟，倒也宏敞壯觀，裏面藏有不少的石碑，在河西一帶比較有名的一塊西夏文碑，便在這文廟裏陳列着，可是經過了多少年代到了現在，又經過多少年代中的人們的撫弄，文跡已模糊不淸了。武威城不算過大，但四郊皆有廣大的平野，平野之上，樹木繁茂，農植豐盛，在河西一帶堪稱富庶之區，前人有金張掖，銀武威之說，這大名鼎鼎銀武威，雖比不上金張掖那樣出色，但余銀總該是被人所重視的吧！</p>

<h3>風雪中跋涉</h3>
<p>爲要腳踏實地的考察，我們得採取一種不人虎穴焉得虎子的精神，去担當我們的任務。雖然地方上的首長和各個單位的負責者，給予不少有價値的報告材料，但實地採訪更加有效、我們是這樣的想。俗說百聞不如一見，你道一見之下是何等的明朗，何等的澈底。他能帮助你解決了不少的疑團，使你增加了說不出的愉快，可是西北的行旅，不如理想的那麽自在，就以從武威向北到民勤縣的那條路說，汽車是無用武之地，牠在平野的地方，僅管如風馳電掣一般的輕快，可是到了道些地方，窘困得像是出水的游魚，動彈不得，於此我們便僱了四輛三馬拖拉的大車，在那空嚝平野風雪飄蕩的大地裏進發着。</p>
<p>一個人在從來不曾到過的地方，雖然生活的一切感覺苦痛，但好奇心的激蕩，會使你忘却了苦痛，而越發的興奮。在一望無垠風在雪舞的廣漠上，除了偶一看見十數匹駱駝行經，陪襯着我們的孤寂外，可以說飛烏已入寒林，牛羊拴在廄棚，我們坐在沒有頂蓬的大車上，被狂風襲擊着幾乎張不開眼睛，被鵝片似的大雪障住了去路，幸兒自武威出發時，請了引路的人，在那四顧茫茫銀灰一片的大千世界裏，替我們指示迷津。</p>
<p>第一天我們住了宗家大門，道是去民勤的頭一宿，想來就在那天，我們經過了兩個大灘，一個是陸家沙灘一個是南灘，車子在經行大灘的時候，輪盤摩擦着黃沙，沙沙的作響，馬蹄陷落在沙地裏，用力愈大陷落愈深，有時幾至不能自拔，有時又因爲馬車夫施展的壓力過大，鞭笞太厲害，竟使馬腿撐不着勁，忽然跪了前腿；忽而失了後腳，好容易渡過了細軟的沙地，走上較堅實的黃土地塊，這時拖車的馬已周身汗濕，大地雖是嚴寒，但馬的呼氣反顯得熱騰，可是這種熱氣，不一會變成了堅冰在馬的鬣毛間，這時的我們因爲坐在車上不曾多動，越　得塞上的寒氣銳不可當，雖然我們每個人都穿着老羊皮大　，仍舊是要擁擠成一　·</p>
<p>戈壁灘裏實在太荒凉了，間或有幾座村舍，和着稀疏的老樹，但呈現在人們眼簾的，總是一片深秋肅殺之氣，其實那是暮春的季節，還是那樣的嚴寒，想來在江南一带，巳是百花爭艷的佳期了，時髦的仕女們也許換上了輕鬆的單衫，而我們仍舊是擁着那腥臭的老羊皮大氅，過着那濃冬的生活，可是說也奇怪，當我和另外一個同伴，坐在車上這樣談講的時候，走過宗家大門不上十丈遠的地方，在一個小草棚的背後，躺臥着一個一絲不掛的人，先是前面的一輛車上的同伴發覺的，因爲我們是在第二輛車上，說時運，那時快，當我們車子走到根前的時候，看見那是一個年約十四五歲的女孩子，她彎着身子，乘着頭，伸手向我們討要，她的表情看來很像知道含羞，但爲生活所逼也難怪出此一途，從那兒我們想到河西一帶的人民是委實的窮，否則一個女子何至於赤裸裸的來抵抗嚴寒來討要哩？惻隱之心，人皆有之，我們爲要表示對她的貧苦發生同情和憐惜的意思，徵集了少許錢給她，但仔細的想來，那少數的錢，又怎能解決她的貧窮問題，而且像這樣的貧窮，又決非是她一人。你一句我一語在車上這樣的談講着，忽然聽得有人高吟道：「朱門酒肉具，路有凍死骨」。我們的話頭被打斷，注意那聲音的來處，原來那是在最後一輛車上的一位年高的同伴，向着大自然道樣的吶喊着。</p>

<p>都市屋荒聲中之怪象！　房主逼遷勢將露宿　願社會各界予以最大之同情</p>
<p>編者先生：我們是一舉將要被迫露宿街頭的房客，在道當局正努力設法解除房荒　中，竟有房主勒索老房客小租不遂，而假借勢力用武驅逐房客的怪劇出演、實堪痛心！</p>
<p>我們是西法華鎭候家弄一號的一所大院落裏分居我們五戶房客，七八年來，與房主黃某尚稱和睦，三年前房主因無法立足滬上，我們房客們自動代爲策劃籌款，或預繳房金二年一年不等藉此鉅款得赴內地任職後方。勝利後，房主亦因復員來滬，房客們正額手慶幸，預備歡迎錦衣榮歸之老房主。豈知黃某頓改昔日舊態，囑全體房客全部選讓，以便轉借新房客，可得鉅額頂費小租，如欲繼續租居者，亦須按照新房客一般重新出納小租，房客等因畏其勢力，莫不忍氣吞聲，再三與之商酌要求，結果應允五戶共出小租六十萬元及每戶每月繳納租米一斗五升並約以二年爲限，另附有種種苛刻條件，房客等恐有意外作萬一保障計請彼出具房租收據，竟因此復成僵局。詎料八月十一日黃率同類似士兵多人前來驅逐房客，聲言拆屋，其勢汹汹登堂入室隨意拆去門板窗戶擱樓牆壁，並將房客傢俱拋置門外，封釘門戶，其橫蠻無理可喻。斯時各戶壯男均出外辦公，僅存婦女弱小，見狀驚慌號哭，該種情狀慘不忍睹。最後經跪地苦苦哀求，黃始率衆恨恨而去。臨行復限房客邏讓，吾則仍須前來拆屋等語。至此房客等實感呼籲無門，求援無路，届時除被逼露宿街頭，淪爲流民之外，別無他法。</p>
<p>編者先生，現在離限期將近，我們這批無告的小民，將怎樣對付這位房主呢？所以想借貴關一角寶貴篇幅，向社會各界作迫切的呼籲，請各界賜以正義的援助，並請指導我們將如何處理道樣悲痛的事件！（西法華鎭侯家弄一號全體房客敬啓）</p>
<h3>蘇北行　揚州　流亡中心</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　杭舟</p>
<p>和第二次世界大戰時爲歐洲小國政府流亡中心的倫敦媲美，揚州有着不少的蘇北流亡縣長·最多的時候有十二個，現在還有六個：高郵，實應，淮安，淮陰，泗陽和漣水·除了流亡的縣政府之外，還有流亡的縣黨部及縣靑年團。</p>
<p>這些流亡縣長臥薪嘗膽地做着還鄉的準備工作。他們大半是蘇北「本地人」·人地是夠熟識的。但單憑熟識有什麽用？他們所有的只是一批散漫的，請領救濟品的難民，一片被蹂躪着的可望而不可即的土地。因此，他們幾乎一無所有。</p>
<p>但他們畢竟還有一個流亡縣政府。江蘇省政府規定一個流亡縣政府的組織是十三個人，一月一百萬元的經費（連職員薪俸在內），和一次撥發的一千五百萬元的復興費，還有一百支步槍，希望他們配合軍事打回去！</p>
<p>流亡縣長　只有苦笑</p>
<p>一千五百萬，聽來是一個頗動人的數字；而現在，上海的關人們連正眼亦不會瞧它一眼·被共產黨「鬥爭」的蘇北，已無異一眞空地帶，那些所謂「解放區」，日後收復過來，談復興，眞是千頭萬緒，不知從何做起！</p>
<p>萬事莫如治安急，那末，要他們把這一千五百萬元完全用在這方面吧，還不能裝備起一個像樣的自衛隊來·蘇北軍事正在開展中，軍隊的任務是抵抗對方，或者是打倒對方，治安勢必要地方當局多負責·「這責任你們能負起嗎？」流亡縣長聽了只有苦笑。不要說將來，即在自由的揚州，到目前爲止，治安還須由軍隊維持。</p>
<p>抱緊大腿　要求慢走</p>
<p>數天前，揚天路上的大儀集的部隊有別的任務要調動，遺下的防務，命自衛隊去擔任。自衛隊——一批未經適當訓練的人們，這時却畏畏縮縮，因爲他們知道，那地區附近還潛伏着共車的殘部。調防的時限到了，原先的軍隊走時，自衛隊尚未到。當地的數萬民衆頓時感到失了保障，痛哭起來，抱住士兵的腿，懇求他們慢慢走：「如果新四軍來了，我們會遭殃的」！一步一拖，那批士兵用了十個鐘頭才走了二十里路。</p>
<p>自衛隊到達之前，共軍先到了。大儀　可憐又遭了一次屠殺；尤其是那些曾經熱烈歡迎國軍的人。後來國軍另外派了一排人上去，才把共軍驅逐出去。</p>
<p>由於共軍玩的一套「看家本領」……遊擊戰，並有出沒無常的地方團隊，民兵到處騷擾，這問題是特別値得注意的·如果地方的武力不能迅速而健全地建立起來，不能以組織去抵制組織，國軍的力量勢必要受到分散。不能大量地發揮。</p>
<p>老牛破車　軍政脫節</p>
<p>問題不僅僅這一個，問題太多了，軍事要求政治密切配合，靈活得像一部機器，而政洽却如老牛破車。軍隊最簡單的要求是要民伕，要材料，要情報，要帮助解決一切的困難，並且說辦就要辦。這些要求最不過分，已使地方當局頭痛萬分，何况政治的主要工作還不在此。</p>
<p>蘇北是一個特殊的區域，共產黨把它作爲他們政治理論試騐的屠塲，因此，政治的鬥爭是更爲尖銳的。組訓民衆，爭取民衆，該是最重要的兩項。蘇北民衆恨共產黨恨透了。把握民衆這一情緒，加以有效的運用，這力量便足使共黨不能立足。但這一切似乎都沒有做，或者做得很少，做得不像樣。</p>
<p>——已流亡出來的，難道是讓他自生自滅？未流亡出來的，難道就任他在共軍的淫威下輾轉呻吟？</p>
<p>失去民心的共黨却用盡了威脅利誘的方法，活躍地從事於政治「鬥爭」。</p>
<p>滿腹經綸　如何施展</p>
<p>「政治趕不上軍事」，是一句成爲古董的老話了，至今還不折不扣地適用，足見病態的沉重。一個縣級行政人員直接與民衆發生關係，比專門發表施政方針的實在重要得多，可是今日的縣級行政人員的待遇比已經菲薄的省級公務人員還要差幾成。一個縣長的新俸是十二萬元·其餘的可想而知了·沒有錢，便如一架機器沒有油，能發生什麽效力？</p>
<p>在這樣的情形下，想做事的人空具滿腹經綸，如何施展？依照規定，一千五百萬元復興費，在回到縣境之前，只能用五百萬元，留着一千萬元回去用。不够—當然不夠—的時候，上面的指示是就地想法。但向油濟子裏榨油，恐怕是一件危險的事。軍事在開展了，流亡的人歡喜還鄉有期，流亡的縣長們却心事重重。「政治趕不上軍事」，說過一千遍了，是不是要讓急性子的武裝弟兄們儘頓腳呢？</p>
<h3>雨季中的菲律賓　馬尼剌七月廿八日航訊</h3>
<p>— 中央社記者邢光祖</p>
<p>當你巡視過馬尼刺全市以後，看見過多少莊嚴的大厦，多少熱鬧的市區，多少仕女盛集的商塲，多少金碧輝煌的夜總會，這許多二十世紀最摩登的裝點，把這馬尼刺的首邑給裝成一座富麗的都市，給譽爲「遠東海面的珍珠」，然而誰也不能否認的，在這浮彫的　榮裏，隱埋着黑暗，貧困，荒淫，汚俗，混亂及人間的七大罪惡，似乎永遠難以洗盡。繼過一番細心的觀察，你可以知道，整個島國的經濟，不過是一個嶙峋突兀的骷髏。</p>
<p>這年靑的共和國，似乎太年靑了，它在政治經濟，以及許多其他方面，正蒙上一層黑翳，需要Prome　theus那樣，能够帶來一些光明和溫暖，我相信，一般的相信，那唯有仰仗於美國——它獨立的頒予者。</p>
<p>雨季中的菲島，一切都給人一種奇異的感覺，像是幽夢，像是沮喪。</p>
<p>幾天來，直是下雨，整個的市街，全給雨水淹蓋着，雨還是落個不停，這兒島國的雨，跟我們國內不同，我們所領會過的那種三春的微雨，正可以點綴江南風光的旖旎，但決不似島國的雨，這兒的雨，有一股蠻勁兒，來得驟，它從不會輕輕地飄散幾點，也不祇似傾瀉的陣雨，而是排出倒海似地直流着，那種不徇情的樣子·叫人害怕，你感着大自然原始力量的兇暴，你懷疑是否上天的魔鬼在肆虐，那成串的大雨點，直流的長雨腳，打落在久經曝露生着黃銹的鐵皮屋頂，直是瘋狂，你躱藏在空間遼闊的房子裏，你不能談話，因爲人類紐軟的聲音全給狂暴的雨聲汨沒了去，這時候你想叫喊，因爲祇有　喊，才能够感覺你自身的存在，有時候你覺得孤力無援，整　的身子欺難似地亳無一氣力……</p>
<p>這回我倚着窗欄，隔着玻璃的雨的紗幕，遙望那片燈光輝煌的馬尼刺市區，直是發愁。</p>

<h3>關於出版教科書的幾點建議</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>暑假結束，各校都快開學了。學生們除了忙着投考學校，催着家長們趕快籌劃學費，或自己辦理申請貸學金的手續之外還有一道難關，那就是買教科書。有的教育家主張廢除教本，我們認為這是偏激之論。教本也是教育工具之一。不過關於現在的教科書，我們以為有幾點原則應該事先提出來和出版界商榷的。</p>
<p>第一，我們覺得現在的教科書，尤其是小學的教本，紙張的質地太差。這在戰時是不可厚非，因為我們要節省物力。但是教育第一的建設時期，我們再也不能因為在紙張上打算而損及兒童的目力和欣賞力。而且在經濟上也不一定合算，因為一位小朋友也許用不到一個月，那本教科書便已經是破爛不堪了。不久再去買第二本。</p>
<p>第二，在發行方面，我們希望要盡量的普遍。上學期，各校的教科書要預先申請，好像配給似的，聽說今年也有這種情形。上學期買教本，我們曾經發現黑市，有些書店裏，假使你不出到相當的代價，你就買不到書。我們但願本學期不會有這種現象。辦法就是增加印行的數量，和普遍的讓各書店代售。</p>
<p>第三，在價格方面，千萬不能漲價。在以前幾年中，我們都看見有一個現象，即在開學之前，各書店突然把許多銷路廣一點的和學校裏通用的書籍收藏了起來，隔了一兩個星期之後，這些書又出現了，可是價格是增高了百分之幾百。現在洋紙進口不少，原價也很公道，希望書店的老闆不要藉口外匯的放長而把書價放長。</p>
<p>教本是普及教育的主要工具之一，這是在精神建設上一件主要的工作，所以我們希望出版界方面的先生們特別為這件事能够規劃一個更妥當的辦法，這不僅是造福學子，而且有功於國家社會。</p>
<h3>懸崖</h3>
<p>— 路青</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>作品的價值當然可以從牠影響人生指導人生的程度來決定。然而要忠實地來批評一件作品，那麼依着牠題材的差異，批評的着眼點便需要隨時改變；因為不同的內容，對於人生的影響和指導作用也是一定不相同的。</p>
<p>鐵流，夏伯陽，或者說屠場，多數人認為是滿意的作品。這就是為了前者充分地解釋了群眾的力量與團體生活的需要，并且用希望和爭鬥來鋪出了一條路；後者則是深刻地述說了生活的苦難，揭開了那層掩住了實生活的人們對幸福的幻想。在它們不同的題材裏，它們（鐵流，夏伯陽以及屠場）都發揮了影響人生的力量，并且收穫了指導人生的效果；因此它們都有了真正的被批評的價值。而我們如果再要求評定它們之間的高下，我說這是愚蠢的思想；原因簡單得很：一支雄壯的合唱曲與一支悲憤的獨唱曲根本不能互想比較，為了兩者雖同是音樂，具有許多相同的素質，然而兩者曲式的不同，情緒的不同都足以完全否定了比較時的準確性。</p>
<p>因此，在性情的解釋上，在激情與理智的啟發上，我都不敢相信：懸崖是一本成功的著作。</p>
<p>中譯本的譯者李林告訴我們，作者岡察洛夫是俄國的文學家，在俄國的文學史上，他是僅晚於屠格涅夫和託爾斯太的。除了懸崖，他只寫了二部小說：一個平凡的故事和阿布洛莫夫。阿布洛莫夫負了很大的聲譽，克魯泡特金在俄國文學之理論與實際裏說他和屠格涅夫的父與子，託爾斯太的戰爭與和平，復活同是十九世紀後半期中最成功的作品。</p>
<p>同樣，在懸崖裏作者也流露了細膩的筆風，而更緊要的是作者曾用了最大的努力描寫出「激情」的原形，也曾用了最大的努力描寫了理智被埋葬在那個「懸崖」深底的情形。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這是帝俄時代，少數的人們擁有着錢財，僕婢與土地。萊司基：一個世家的唯一繼承人；他沒有兄弟或是姐妹，連父母也都早就死亡了。所以，他的祖姨撫養着他，管理着他應該承受的全部產業。萊司基在這裏度過了他的童年，他不常和祖姨或表妹們在一起，而每喜獨自行走在伏爾加河邊或是春天的山野裏；這種生活造成了他性情上的冷靜和孤僻漸漸地他愛好了藝術和文學。之後，他去莫斯科過了十多年放蕩的生活，終於在讀完了大學的那一年的夏天重又回到了這伏爾加河邊的家中來。現在他的二個表妹都已經長大了，出落得十分美麗。於是他住下來，在平日的交遊裏認識了一些附近的貴族們，更也認識了馬克——一個被政府第二次流放的政治犯。</p>
<p>這是一個多麼危險的怪物，馬克。然而有一次他偷喫着萊司基園中的蘋菓時，被萊司基的長表妹薇拉看見了，偶然的一二句詰問與回答後，他們竟均被對方大胆的思想與廣博的學識所傾倒了。以後他們很秘密地來往着。討論着。不過萊司基是不知道這些的，任何人都不知道這些。萊司基的心目中，薇拉是這一帶地方的珍珠，具有無上的美麗與智慧的；這是一朵微火，充滿了幽暗和閃光的神秘，更像夜一樣充滿了魅力，這魅力吸住了萊司基，使他不能離開她的身邊。薇拉感到了被偵察的苦痛，感到了十分地不自由。她對表哥開始怒惱了，更作了明白的暗示——這使萊司基嘗到了墮入情網後的苦悶。他十分急切地希望能探悉薇拉心中放的是什麼秘密；他發現薇拉收讀着用火漆封口的藍色的信件，他發現薇拉出入無常，精神恍惚。因此他漸漸地加深了疑惑和不安；他曾經明白地問祖姨說薇拉的本性是什麼？也曾經焦灼地要想知識薇拉態度改變的原因「她變得非常沉思已經有一些時候了，你注意到沒有？她該不會有戀愛吧」？然而這分心是徒然的，薇拉變得更沉思更深刻了。</p>
<p>在這片領地的盡處，是一個降下到伏爾加河去的懸崖。崖上長滿了野草和灌木叢，一條小路從林樹中間引伸到崖底。那兒有一個年久的涼亭和一個為愛情而自殺的人的墳墓。并且還有一個可怕的傳說，因此人們不會無故地走到這兒來。馬克和薇拉卻選擇了這兒作為幽會的地點；他們用槍聲作為訊號。</p>
<p>薇拉曾經讀過伏爾特爾利蒲魯東的作品，對整個人世有了反動的看法；她心中充塞了各種不同的解釋——對於社會，財產乃至生命。因此她信仰過馬克，因為在昏暗裏，馬克第一個替她點燃了燈火，指示出一條新的路途來。</p>
<p>許多天了，馬克不曾用槍聲喚叫薇拉。他倆曾經十分興趣地聚在一起，而今是為了過分忠實於自己的理想又被分了開來。在薇拉，這無異是生命的喪失；她頹喪得很，漸漸地接受了萊司基的安慰而尊重了萊司基的同情。不自主地，她把深心的不平告訴了他，在萊司基面前懺悔了自己的行動。這樣薇拉萊司基的安慰和宗教的歸依平靜地渡過了與馬克突然分手的初期中苦痛的日子滿以為以後慢慢能從矛盾的心境中解放出來，重新過着寗靜的生活了。然而第七天的傍晚，突然槍聲從懸崖那邊傳過來。一個將平復的創口，又被深深地刺傷了：自由，愛情，幸福，堅強，薇拉是什麼都記回來了。然而她立刻躊躇起來：要是去吧，馬克是一個最崛強的男性，除了爭辯，分手以外，又有什麼呢？不去吧，實在薇拉沒有這力量，她明白自己是一隻苦海的羔羊，需要水也需要奶。她心中，激情與理智開始明顯地對立，爭鬥。最後她不顧一切地跑到懸崖去，而萊司基卻像一座神像般地在路的盡處伸開了擱阻的手，第二次槍聲又傳了上來，萊司基感到自己正在把一個快被激情吞噬的女性搶救着。他用理智的聲音警告薇拉，懸崖不是逗留的地方：「這條路太陡了，你會再跌倒的」。他用理智的聲音呵責薇拉回去。然而什麼也沒有效力，第三次槍聲後，萊司基只得允許了，讓薇拉一步一步地走下懸崖去。</p>
<p>這一切，萊司基看見了。他心中突然地厭惡了自己以外的任何人，他對薇拉開始了極度的蔑視與仇視。可是不多時日，對薇拉卻又變得同情了。因為激情的驅使下，人性本來是不堅定的；何況薇拉已經陷在嚴重的自譴和病痛裏了！萊司基十分慚愧地向薇拉承認了一切自己的內疚，并且勸薇拉應該讓祖母知道這些事情。這是一幅很動人的互相信託互相了解的場面。薇拉責備着自己，反而一點也不怨天尤人，十分安靜起來。她更把事實告訴了一個很親密的男友杜斯，帶着懺悔的音調說：「你的純潔的薇拉已經葬下在那懸崖深處」。她不再把秘密放在自己心中，這樣地獲得了充分的同情來抵抗心上激情所遺下的苦痛。</p>
<p>馬克又給薇拉寫信來，提議從此實行同居，然而薇拉已經叫火燒痛了手指，再也不敢第二次來握這朵火熖了——雖然看來火熖依然是美麗的。</p>
<p>秋天來了，大夢初醒一般，萊司基開始又想起了漫遊的生活來，渡過了阿爾卑斯去。遙遙地他懷念着伏爾加河邊的生涯；懷念着祖姨塔夏娜，也懷念着被激情毀傷了的可憐的薇拉。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這裏，整個故事的穿插都是以薇拉為中心的，而從薇拉的每一個笑影，每一回沉思裏，作者卻佈置了激情與理智的無上的矛盾與爭鬥。故事的背景沒有改變：俄羅斯的一角寗謐的土地。伏爾加河靜靜地流，閃着白色的波光流過了二岸綠的田園和樹叢；這裏有萊司基的領地，美麗的園圃，然而在這地域以外，作者預先安排了吃人的懸崖。</p>
<p>薇拉是不慣生活上的優裕的，她具有了靈性的智慧；這靈性的智慧驅使她去追求不可能的理想的生活，而無望的追求終于造成了她灰黯苦悶的命運。她有強烈的求智慾，因此她蒐集了多　的新知識；這些知識促成了她對實生活的不滿，而實生活切依舊壓束着她：薇拉的苦惱是這樣形成的。現在我們明白，薇拉的認識馬克愛馬克應該是很自然的了。然而薇拉正像是一隻苦渴的小羊，她只知道馬克手中有水，卻沒有顧慮到這水是否可以當作飲料，等到她以自己的智慧和經驗斷定這水中的素質時，天哪——激情已經把她和馬克捆在一起了！萊司基發覺了這些，然而萊司基太平凡了，拉不回這個迷惑激情的表妹。「我警告過你，薇拉。我說過激情是個凶猛的狼」。然而這有什麼用？薇拉的聲音是病人的哀求：「帮助我去生活。把那種放出榮耀的光輝照射着整個生命的美麗的激情給我吧」。并且：「現在要我不再到懸崖去已經太遲了」！</p>
<p>激情，不錯——是個凶猛的狼！薇拉掙脫它的凶噬，誰又是掙得脫它的凶噬的？每一遍讀完懸崖後，我如此想。翻開三年來的日記，我清清楚楚地記轉來激情留給我的苦楚；「斷紘」「塔」，「春風容易」以及「　歌」；不講了吧！我如今含着滿心的羞慚與憂痛，當每一次我重讀舊作的時候。激情驅使我走在一條不平坦的山路上，跌倒了又爬起來，現在我發現自己二十歲的年紀，卻已有了八十歲人一樣的灰黯悲嘆的心境。</p>
<p>我承認自己處在青春期的各種矛盾與衝突裏，激情對我具了極大的支配力。我曾經盲目地憎愛一切，也曾在歡笑的時候突然哭泣起來。懸崖，畢竟用母親一樣慈愛的輕蔑告訴了我——一個悲慘的故事。明顯地在我面前畫了一隻凶猛的狼，而在狼的嘴裏，血淋淋地奪下了一顆被咬傷了的心：我認得這是薇拉的，而也是我的！不過薇拉是被犧牲了的，因為萊司基不曾澈底地拯救了她；我是幸福的了，懸崖已經有力地指示了我激情的歸宿。</p>
<p>懸崖，對一個理性判斷力稚弱的青年還不是一盞黑夜的明燈？</p>
<h3>讀「教育與人生」後</h3>
<p>— 朱家慶</p>
<p>著者　余家菊　出版　正中書局</p>
<p>余先生本書前言中，就很誠懇地告訴了我們：他曾師承杜威博士。所以全書的骨幹，雖然引用了許多儒家的經典與術語；但是還表現了「自然的經驗主義（Natural　Empiricism）」的彩色體系。好像上面這兩句話，是最為中肯的了。就是在討論「發育」的一方面，也完全根據了杜威博士的解釋；杜威博士把人格的發展分為（一）生物的（本能的）（二）社會的（習俗的），（三）理性的（批判的）這三個階段；而余先生也把他分為（一）物質我，（二）社會我，（三）精神我這三個階段。（見杜威博士著（一）“Ethics”.（二）“How　we　Think”）</p>
<p>至於論及教育的可能性時，也與杜威博士的意見相彷彿。杜威博士解釋教育的可能性為「未成熟（Immatucity）」；同時這未成熟又有兩個含義：（一）依靠性，（二）可塑性。（見杜威博士著Democracy　and　Ecucation）余先生則又把「未成熟」與「依靠性」合成一個概念，稱為「向上性」。其實因其是未成熟與需要依靠，才能向上。所以這又不過在術語上的差別而已。</p>
<p>不過余先生除了闡述自然的經驗主義教育思想體系之外，又特別強調了「意志」與「信行」這個方面。這種思想，恰又與尼采的哲學思想相吻合。因為尼采一方面承受了康德的學說，深得唯心論的奧妙。一方面確真是達爾文的信徒，力倡「超人」主義；擁護生存競爭與自然淘汰的說數，同時余先生在本書很多部份，說明信仰的重要，尤過於知識。人類所處的環境，複雜而時在變遷；若以有限的知識，應付這無限的環境，時有會覺得不夠。所以祗能憑諸信仰與意志，當然的，這樣一來，更應得勵志與信行之重要了。</p>
<p>余先生又主張極端尊重法律；這又與黑格爾的思想一致。同時他以為所能被稱為「完人」或「超人」者，恐怕僅有「國家」而已。所以他在本書中曾說：「國家者，民族文化之最高審判人，指導人，開發人也」。</p>
<h3>關於第二次世界大戰的幾部史書</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>關於第二次世界大戰史的著述，現在能見到的，大概只有幾種。在國內出版的，有儲玉坤的一部「第二次世界大戰史」，本年四月，上海永祥書館出版。作者在自序中說：「從一九三九年九月一日歐洲大戰爆發的一天開始，已開始搜集材料，化了八年的工夫，才寫成本書。」他又說：「關於國際問題的著作，大半是繙譯而成的。我立志要為我著作界開一先例。」但他又很坦白的指出兩個缺點：（1）「太平洋戰爭爆發後，幾乎無法取得真實的消息，因此便決定這本書的內容，偏重在歐洲方面，而將遠東太平洋方面，略而不詳，擬另成專冊。」（2）對於大戰的結束，不及寫大戰爆發那末詳盡，因為敵人把我平時所搜集的資料，一齊　了去，散失了，不得已只好草草地完成後半部書。</p>
<p>全書共分十二章三百另七頁，把聯合國憲章全文，作為附錄。</p>
<p>其次為「第二次世界大戰簡史」World　War　H：　A　Concise，　History徐格和第五德Roger　W.　Shugg　Ph.　D.　and　Major　H.　A.　DeWeerd合著，本年在華盛頓Washington，　The　Infantry　I　ournal，1946出版。這是一部簡略的軍事史。在紀載方面，據作者們說，力求其準確。從這部書中，我們可以檢得很多的戰役，是在什麼時候，什麼地點發生的，經過的情形，究竟怎樣。同時作者們又聲明他們并不埋沒同盟國家對於這次戰事上的貢獻，雖然美國是占據着很重要的地位。</p>
<p>這部書原是為美國軍人而編的，但文字并不「專門」，可供公眾閱讀與參考之用。全書共五百三十八頁，附地圖四十四幅甚便檢查。</p>
<p>又其次為洛脫Waverley　Root所著的「歐戰秘史」The　Secret　History　of　the　War去年在紐約Charles　Sribner's　Sons，　New　York，1945出版，全書共兩大冊。另有一冊，題名為「從喀塞白蘭加至嘉汀」Casablanca　to　Katyn：　the　Secret　History　of　the　War　雖算是第三冊，但其性質是獨立的。</p>
<p>作者的態度是公允的，能力是高強的。他在戰事的幕後，去尋求許多不曾發現的因素和事實。這部書的範圍，并不限定一個戰場，一個戰役，一個或幾個交戰的國家。有很多政治的行動，宣傳的工作，外交的折衝，和戰術的錯誤，原原本本的寫來，簡直使人看了，心裏有點不高興，甚而至於不敢置信。</p>
<p>作者是個新聞記者，從一九二七年起，即在各地擔任工作。書中材料，大都在歐洲搜集的。內幕情形，據說竭力避免感情作用，求其忠實。</p>
<p>又其次為密拉Fraucis　Trevelyan　Miller　litt.　D．，　LL.　D．所編的「第二次世界大戰史」History　of　World　War　II。在寫成這部書的時候，另有一個專門史事和軍事的編輯部Board　of　Historical　and　Military　Authorities，其人物為黑門Dr.　Curt　L.　Heymann，其研究軸心國進攻荷蘭，比利時，挪威，希臘，巴耳幹半島的史實專家，菲滋伯Benedict　Fitzpartrick研究英國專家，貝加Karl　Burger，研究中歐問題專家，墨格門Charles　Lam　Markmann研究盟軍反攻法國，北非，義國，德國各戰役專家，雷恩Victor　H.　Lawn研究遠東，中，印，菲列賓各戰役專家，哈爾司，Crerar　Harris，研究蘇聯正事軍事專家，羅勃　Werner　Loeb，研究德國納粹及青年運動專家。全書共九百六十六頁，有各種照片，地圖，重要文件等等。編者在序中說，希望這本書能成一種「標準」著作。</p>
<p>編者指出這次大戰，死傷凡二千萬人，流離失所都凡三千萬人，屠殺都凡一千萬人。耗費財力，估計約在一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美金左右。所以我們不得不分析其原因，敘述其結果，使以後不再有同樣的慘劇發生。</p>
<h3>隱士的鬍鬚</h3>
<p>— 朱力</p>
<p>賀宜著　少年出版社出版</p>
<p>賀宜是一位優秀的兒童文學家，他的創作具備了剖視現實，表現人性的特質，也具備了濃厚情趣，兒童口吻的描寫；他給兒童美滿的欣賞和良好的教育。在今天，一般早熟的色情故事和神仙鬼怪的讀物，正在麻醉和刺激幼稚的心理之時，我們是怎樣期待一些有益的兒童讀物呢！賀宜的創作已經出版的有下列幾種：</p>
<p>真實的故事（短篇集）</p>
<p>凱旋門（長篇）</p>
<p>隱士的鬍鬚（短篇集）</p>
<p>木頭人（長篇）</p>
<p>野小鬼（長篇）</p>
<p>雪人（短篇集）</p>
<p>金鈴子（長篇）</p>
<p>兒童國（長篇）</p>
<p>野旋的童話（短篇集）</p>
<p>騰雲駕霧（長篇科學故事）</p>
<p>兩兄弟（長篇）</p>
<p>地獄（長篇）</p>
<p>孩兒橋（短篇集）</p>
<p>在這些集子里面，我們沒有發現過一篇對兒童有惡劣影響的作品，誘使兒童發生崇拜權力，崇拜黃金，迷信機運的兒童文學時代已經過去了。</p>
<p>「隱士的鬍鬚」這一集子里面，包含了九個短篇：「隱士的鬍鬚」「鏡子的故事」「科學家」「兩個巨人和大野豬」「心心商場」「光頭皮」「詩人和他的兒子」「蜜蜂國」「三個問題」。這些作品產生時，正當東方的侵略者，陳兵東亞平原，也是一般人民正覺醒到要憑自己的意志去生活的時候；這些作品反映了這個時代。</p>
<p>在「隱士的鬍鬚」這一短篇中，作者用輕鬆的筆觸，描寫一個隱士，他要逃避現實和敵人，想躱到一個大森林里面，但是現實究竟是現實，活着不能不吃飯，不能不穿衣，於是隱士又跑到鎮上，遇到了敵人，就做了順民，做了敵人的苦力，漂亮的鬍鬚也給割掉了，編成一根很好的繩子繫在他自己的頸子里，給敵人牽着走。</p>
<p>在同一集子的一篇「兩個巨人和大野猪」，作者用出奇的寫法描寫一些窮人們是怎樣覺醒的，窮人們怎樣懂得反抗。一個巨人是窮人們反抗意識的象徵，一個巨人是有錢有勢的代表，正是兩種對抗的努力。兩個巨人廝打之際，腦袋上貼着膏藥標記的大野豬侵犯進來了，於是兩個巨人攜起手來，共同抵抗這隻野豬，把大野豬打倒，他們就同心合力來建設許多新的東西。</p>
<p>單就這兩個例子，我們已經可以了解作者的用心了：作者諷刺落伍與順從，作者指出團結　侮的力量，在兒童小小的心靈中將起着怎樣一種影響。</p>
<p>有人以為寫給兒童間讀的東西，一定要有點浪漫趣味，仙女王子可以引兒童到非非之境，神怪冒險可以使兒童手不釋卷。其實，并不盡然的。現實童話的題材，只要處理得好，何嘗不能吸引兒童去閱讀呢。我們給予兒童閱讀的讀物，不是給他們的消遣，而是給他們教育，孩子和大人們一樣，他們也是有血有肉的人，他們也是生長在這個世界的啊！</p>
<p>賀宜在這方面的努力是值得我們欽佩的。</p>

<h3>音樂與國界</h3>
<p>— 朱理惺</p>
<p>「一個沒有出過大作曲家的民族，他當然仍有他的權利去欣賞以至於了解音樂的。原因是樂藝的本身乃世界上任何藝術中最不應有國界分歧的一種，日耳曼民族中的每一個人，固可以把他們這個民族在有史以來輩出偉大的音樂家引以自豪，但我們非日耳受人正可以此尊重他們的光榮，又何必存下了自卑心理，活生生的把藝術本身沒有國界之分的歧視的錯誤，弄得越來越深呢！我說這是一個絕大的錯誤，我們不應有如此的偏見，因爲樂藝的本身是世界上任何藝術巾最不該有國界分歧的一種啊！」阿力克山大，派德　斯基（AlezandrePadereski）曾在他私人關於樂藝的剳記裏，特別顯明地摘下這節某年月日在一個盛大交響樂會之前的扼要「致詞」而爲它反覆的說了兩遍，他在樂壇上誰都無可否認的是蕭邦（Chopin）之後，唯一的鋼琴聖手兼一生專攻悲多汶朔拿大（BeethovensSonata）而得其神髓復創一格獨成門戶的大作曲家，同時在國際政治舞台上他是第一决世界大戰後不久的波蘭內閣總理，其後由總理而任該國的總統，他可以說是本世紀初葉世界上德高望重才智兼美的人物之一，然而他對由於戰敗而產生波蘭的日耳曼民族的中柱國家的德意志，他依舊是放棄政治上難免的偏見，譽揚日耳曼民族在歷代輩出偉大的音樂家中，他衷心表示十二萬分的敬仰不止。</p>
<p>有史以來，在事實上今天誰要編一部音樂史，慢說你不存絲毫的偏見，縱然你把「偏見」執迷不悟起來，我想你只得幹些「有終無始」的蒐集，要不然其不免寸步難行也幾希！遠迄十六世紀至於今日，够得上稱做永垂不朽的大作曲家，百分之八十五倒出在日耳曼民族的德，奧兩國裘，條頓民族只佔到百分之三，斯拉夫民族遠說到黑海以北也不過佔劉百分之五，倒總算羅馬民族高佔到百分之七，至於亞洲民族，簡直乾脆的可以說一聲百分之〇，甚且有些中國人都感覺聽這些一東西，無異於是受一種刑罰，大槪你請他研究或欣賞尚且「不得要領」，那裏還有那種由於妒嫉而生的自卑和歧峴的心理產生。</p>
<p>撇開政治不談，希特勒把他們的民族有由以來音樂人才以至偉大的作曲家的輩出，大事宣揚，當然，在我們除了捫心自問，認愧不如之外，難不成以爲他實不足引以爲豪麽？實實在在的說，堪稱萬古不朽的偉大作曲家，確是百分之八十五的出在他們的民族裏，三世紀又一葉以來，日耳曼民族中的作曲家始終爲歷代音樂史上的中柱人物，其後二百餘歷年以降，日精月異，培植了今後我們欣賞和研究的甚礎，追源溯往，有誰能對他們的「自豪」加以貶値？又有誰能對他們不捫心自問，認愧不如？</p>
<p>巴哈（JohannSebastienBach以降，世界上任何系　對日耳曼民族貢獻於人類樂藝史上的優異，早已確立其印象，及至十九世紀中葉，又由伐格納（RichardWagner）大刀闊斧之勢的「中興崛起」，就簡直把日耳受民族歷代所貢獻於人類樂藝史上的優異，更變本加厲放大光彩，這側時候匪特沒有人可對他們的「自豪」加以貶値，匪特沒有人可對他們不捫心自問，認愧不如，抑且個個叫好，甘拜下風，可是却也山此而後，終於也把樂藝上國界小我之分，一筆勾銷，因了這種來　，樂藝的光輝，始得永垂不朽。</p>
<p>正如派德勒斯基所說：「樂藝的本身是世界上任何藝術中最不該有國界分歧的一種啊！」舉世卿往樂藝的人類，理該鐲除自卑，拋棄偏見，一致的向樂藝的大道上邁進！</p>

<h3>一張信稿</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>在我的抽屜裏，藏着一張信稿。那是一張灰黃色的小紙片，上面有幾行細小的鋼筆字，字跡潦草又模糊，塗改又塗改；但是我愛這張信稿，珍視這張信稿；我已把牠小心地保藏四年了。</p>
<p>那是一九四二年一月裏的事情。在太平洋戰爭爆發的一天，我的正在患病的父親，因爲是美國教會的牧師，被當地的日本憲兵隊捉去，關了六個多星期，還不釋放。一切的辦法都已想盡，一切的門路都已走完，總是無效，最後，在無可奈何之中，有一天夜裏，我聽了幾個朋友的捉議，試試看親自寫一封信給那憲兵隊長，希望能激發起他的一點兒天良、有釋放我患病的父親。這張灰黃色的小紙片，便是我寫那一封信的底稿。</p>
<p>後來我的父親得到釋放了。當然不知道是否那封信的功勞，但我的心中，已毫不客氣地覺得自己做了一個智勇俱全的救父的英雄，我就此把那封信的底稿視作珍實，把牠用手帕包起，小心地藏進抽屜，拍拍胸膛，得意地向自己說：</p>
<p>一等到那一天，我要把這張信稿拿出來給萬人看！等到那一天，我要把這件事告訴所有從還方歸米的朋友！等到那一天，我要告訴大家，那一夜寫這信的時候，我是如何地壓抑着悲憤，忍受着恥辱，揮動着抖瑟的筆尖，……等到那一天……</p>
<p>等到那一天，……是的、我的期望太多了，我撫摸着那張信稿，熱烈地等待着！</p>
<p>我沒有失望，「那一天」果然來到了。遠方的朋友們一個個回來了。</p>
<p>第一個來看我的是素芳，來自成都，精神抖擻地跨進我房裏。我興奮地跳上去抓着她的手說：「素芳！你等得我好苦，我要告訴你一件事呀！……」說到這裏，我正想去拉開抽屜取出那信稿來給她看，却不料被她一聲阻住了：</p>
<p>「你別忙！你先看看我的手臂上有什麼改變嗎？」她說得很急很響，幾乎把一條風　僕僕的玉臂直伸到我眉上，我只得耐着性子對她的手臂看了看，回答她道：「沒有什麼改變，不過好像多了這個疤，……」</p>
<p>「正是這個疤呀！」她的又急又響的聲音又立刻搶上來：「這個疤，啊，你知道這個疤的來歷嗎？你看到這四年前在××報上登載的一段關係我的新聞嗎？……」</p>
<p>眞是了不得！向來很文雅沉靜的素芳，八年不見，竟成了一個慷慨激昂的演說家。她指手揮腳講着她到了內地，如何寗願犧牲掉醫院裏越優的護士長職位，去加入防空救護隊；如何無數次冒着危險，救護了數千數百受傷的同胞；如何在四年前一次大轟炸中，在烈火和彈片巾奔來跑去，最後自已也終於受傷了，倒在地上，血汨汨地流出來，於是，如何被同事們抬進醫院，如何受到總司令的嘉獎，如何在當天××報上把她的名字登出來，如何在手臂上留下這個永久的紀念，這個疤！………</p>
<p>她興奮地講着，重複了又重複，等到講完，天已經黑了。</p>
<p>天黑了，我只得把一隻揘在抽屜擋上的手放下來，送走了素芳。</p>
<p>我並不失望，我知道還有別的朋友要來，我等待着。</p>
<p>果然，第二位朋友又從遠方來了！是已經嫁了人的霞珍。</p>
<p>像吹進來一陣暖和的春風，霞珍煥發的容光一出現在我房門口，我這沉寂的房間，也頓時活潑而有生氣了。</p>
<p>照例微笑，握手，問候了幾句路途的辛苦，我的手又伸到抽屜邊，預備把那張珍藏了四年的信稿拿出來。</p>
<p>可是，我的手還沒有抓住那抽屜擋，一樣香噴噴的東西已塞到我那隻手心裏來了。</p>
<p>香噴噴的東西是一隻精美的洋信封，裏面有一張六寸大的照片，照片上有一架飛機，飛機前面站着幾個　貴的女人，內中也有靈珍。</p>
<p>「呵，你看這張照片，這是前年我在×地婦女協會任職時，和數位同事去歡迎×夫人，在××機塲拍的。………」</p>
<p>這位漂亮的少奶奶，從照片而婦女協會，從婦女協會而×夫人從×夫人而×要人，從×要人而她的丈夫，從她的丈夫而某雜誌，從某雜誌而她的一篇驚人的文章，…………竟如黃河決了口，一發而不可止。</p>
<p>天又黑下來了，我請外過一天再來談談，因爲我也想告訴她一些事，可是她說；（　　不能來了！找是回來望望　親！後天就要回上海的，因她在上海等我一同飛往××去」。</p>
<p>餒珍走了，我略有些掃興。但我仍不失望，我知道一定還有其他的朋友會來看我。</p>
<p>是的，其他的朋友來了·是一個二十歲的靑年！</p>
<p>我用愉快的心情歡迎這靑年，他是我五年前的學生，一個聰明　厚的孩子。他並不來自遙遠的大後方，乃是從西鄉荒僻的山野　歸來。</p>
<p>這一回我想總可以達到我的願望了。我一面笑着招呼這靑年，一面興奪地伸手去開我的抽屜，然而糟糕！</p>
<p>「先生！先生—告訴你！我現在步槍，機關槍，小鐧砲，本砲，……什麽都曾開了！………」這靑年剛坐下，就接連不斷地向我說於：「告訴你，從前有一次敵人來攻火　山，我們的部隊剛正調開剩下不多幾人，於是我們學校　幾百個學生，都臨時充了兵，那時我還不會開槍，就拼命把手溜彈向敵人擲去，結果竟然給我擲死了十幾個敵人。又有一次，………」</p>
<p>等這靑年滔滔地鬧完他殺敵的功績時，天又黑了。於是我又縮回了那隻預備去開抽屜的手，送走了他。</p>
<p>我終於有些失望了。</p>
<p>現在，我還是藏着那張價稿。我仍愛牠，珍視牠但我已不再想，將牠拿出來給任何人看，因爲我知道任何人肚子裏有一個比我更偉大的故事。</p>
<h3>神秘的門</h3>
<p>— 蒼民</p>
<p>在我住屋的窗前，有一堵斑駁的黃土牆，距離窗口頂多不過四尺遠·因而·我的屋內是如此的陰暗。</p>
<p>每當看書疲倦或心情不快的時候·我最愛憑窗眺一望，希望窗外能帶給我以什麽東西。然而，現在所能看到的、除了黃土的裂縫（據說浪漫派畫家從這上能看出圖畫，而我不能），和嵌在土中的零星的瓦礫外，別的什麼也沒有。窗外是一條圓無人聲的深巷·</p>
<p>我每次眺　的結果，得來的都只是寂寞，寂寞，多麽難堪的寂寞啊！</p>
<p>窗外難道當眞是一片寂寞的世界嗎？</p>
<p>不、我想不是的，反之；那該是一個　大的，有無數人民在掙扎，在呼號的世界，不過，這世界完全被這堵牆所蒙蔽了。</p>
<p>我凝想看窗外的牆，用上帝賦與人類特有的智慧思索着，狠久很久，室內是無比的寗靜。我伏在桌上，讓徵風吹拂着我的蓬亂的頭髪，突然，那堵牆搖幌起來，而且帶有　徵的響聲，於是，常中閃出一個門來，門上懸有透明的水晶股的簾子，從外面可以淸晰地看見那裏面的情景：彷彿是一間大屋子，又好像是在嚝野，有那麽多的人·男的·女的·老的·幼的，他們的面都是同義的蒼白·痛苦·恐怖和難堪的飢餓所燃燒的眼睛。有的背負着包袱和孩子在殘破的公路上奔跑，有的坐在田　上垂嘆息·最令人感動的是一個跪在地上的婦人，在她的面前是一個由病的　子（好像是受傷的小鳥躺着不動），她哽咽着，用慈母的手撫摩她愛兒的蒼白的面頰。而在她的背是火光冲天，空中塗滿晚霞最　麗的彩色，和流星般隕落的槍彈繪成的弧綫………</p>
<p>我注視着，久久的不動，而那神秘的門，突然又被一種不可知的力量關閉了，現在，横在眼前的依然是一堵斑駁的黃土牆·</p>
<p>我驚異地呆坐在窗前，並企圖理解牠全部的意義。</p>
<p>然而，我不能了解這夢幻般的意象，只覺得有一種細小的蟲在我的心靈中爬行着，牠使我感到愁悶與痛苦。</p>
<p>現在我的屋內又恢復先前的寗靜了，但寂寞也又從每一個角落　來，使人感到孤獨與窒息的苦痛。</p>
<p>願上帝再打開這神秘的門吧，並顯示我以更多的別的東西：</p>
<h3>小山</h3>
<p>— 景行</p>
<p>沒有攀登過崇山峻嶺的人是不容易體會到小山的美麗的，正像一個居住在都市底高樓大厦裏的人，不懂簡陋底茅屋的結構一樣。</p>
<p>高大底山如一個健壯底婦人般，具有着肥大底臀部及高聳底乳峯，粗壯底臂膀與圓渾的大腿，一切都顯得粗綫條地，小山不同於這樣，她像一個文靜底，嬌慵底少女般，以羞澀底目光偷偷地溜視着近旁底一切。</p>
<p>大山以縣崖，高峯，絕壁，深淵，稱成一幅駭人底圖畫，好像要吞噬掉世界一般，小山沒有這些叫人却步底境地，她靜靜地平臥在地面上，甘心地承受着一切動物底踐踏，如一隻溫順的綿羊般地馴服。</p>
<p>雨天，薄綰似的烟霧籠罩了她，山尖在濃淡不同底雲層裏若隱若現地浮動着，往往有一絲神秘底美意掠過人底腦際，等晴朗底天氣展開時，小山又淸晰地裸露在人底面前，一顆草，一株樹，在明媚底陽光下欣欣然顧視着周圍，小山在這時候顯示出沉靜，和穆，高貴，溫良底氣息，如典型底哀方少女所特具的一切東方情調。</p>
<p>陰天叫小山　上更寗黛底顏色，在灰暗底天幕前，小山和我底距離好像更移近了似地，一塊石頭底稜角能够更淸楚地爲我看到，這時候她完全像一個懷春底女郎般，帶着憂鬱，傷感，煩愁底表情而又嬌娼地向人間凝視。</p>
<p>我愛小山，愛她底平凡無奇，愛她底文靜柔順，更愛她沒有大山底險惡——如一個黑暗底社會裏所有底險惡。</p>
<p>我愛小山，愛她底羞澀與溫良，愛她底無私與坦白，不論晴天，陰天，雨天，小山所給予人底永遠是一個善良底感覺。</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 蘇姍</p>
<p>天際的落霞，構成了横曳着一條條藍，黃，黑，白，的圖案，眼前底五光十色，不禁重激起心頭底幻影，然而往年光澤的額上，已添了累累的皺紋。叵顧那迷迷茫茫的來路，又數不淸何處是盡頭，佇立——竟又墮入了大自然的幻夢裏。</p>
<p>「啞—啞—啞」雁陣在天邊掠過，驚醒我該是回窠的時候了，「鳥倦飛而知歸」但是何處是盡頭呢？一片凄涼的荒蕪，斷垣與殘壁。一顆未死的童心，難道想再聆聽祖父底「小孩與人魚的故事」嗎？比夢更難呵，看，剛過眼的雲烟，又在作它千層萬層的變化了</p>
<p>還是要提起蹣跚遲　的步伐，走着我那茫無目的的天涯路踏出到頭來的一天。</p>
<p>「生—死」</p>
<p>「搖籃——墳墓」何必多作躊躇。</p>
<p>當時你告訴我：「以前底心頭像古井，現在却又起了重波」，目前呢？將以古戰塲來比擬你的心境，江海來對照你的情潮，能不能把你的淚珠給我，我將用我的針和綫穿聯在一起，永遠掛在我的胸前。</p>
<p>黑暗層層的罩來，再看不見天際的笑黶，模索着前進，遍天涯我呼着你的名字。</p>
<h3>警戒　（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 溫（一八四七—一九一〇）作</p>
<p>史·藏格拉斯哥美術舘</p>
<p>以動物畫而論，史溫可謂空前之天才，無人能及。氏少年時即入華賽斯脫美術學校，二十七歲赴巴黎，習繪畫與彫刻，受貝利派之影響甚深。其作品著名者有「但丁與豹」，「喜馬拉推之幼虎」「北」等等。「警戒」一幅，極可顯露其卓越之天才</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風17</p>
<p>「不大明白閣下的意思——現在祇能走兩條路；或是回到敝原防，或是繞道到豐苔。」這傢伙的態度漸漸變了，「猪　」的眞面目也逐漸恢復了。</p>
<p>「我們斟酌一下罷！」我和小老虎一前一後的下了車，車燈的朦朧微光下，祗看見退到幾尺以外兩個傢伙的剪影，此外則是模糊一片。</p>
<p>「請上車罷！」兩個傢伙已經拔出了手槍。「在戰塲上是要嚴守命令的。」</p>
<p>「那你們得聽我的命令！」一　說：我一隻手掏出了槍，一隻手伸出去，想把小老虎撈到身後。</p>
<p>就在我說話未究的時候，他們雙槍齊舉，我覺得身體猛地一震，向車身横闖過去，正好跌坐在車子腳踏板上，手槍已經脫手，不知飛到那裏去了。</p>
<p>奇跡也就在槍聲之下發生了；小老虎這個十三歲的孩子，不知在什麽時候用什麽身法，早已飛撲過去；祗這一下，已經衝倒了一個，——正是那位半截樹椿似的猪玀——一路翻滾，跌到黑影裏去了。賸下那個駕駛員，却舉着槍，隨着小老虎，一個猴子似的黑影，左右挪動的射擊着，只見那個黑影，來往閃動了兩三回，倏地一躍，整個身體，像砲彈似的對準那駕駛員拋擲了過去，將駕駛員衝倒，只聽見哼了一聲，兩個人都不見動靜了。這種種動作的經過，也不過幾秒鐘時間吧。</p>
<p>「老伯」小老虎，一個小黑團子似的影子，　在那個倒下去的駕駛員一起，悄悄地招呼我，「您沒傷着吧？」接着就有一隻手電筒的光，閃亮了一下·就在這一亮之下，照明了地上躺着一個，旁邊站着一個搜條的身影。</p>
<p>我站起來，剛想警告小老虎什麼，只見他那搜條的影子，一閃身已經跑到一丈開外的地方，又把手電筒亮了一下。</p>
<p>「都完哪，老伯！」</p>
<p>「怎麽着？」我有些相信不過走了過去。</p>
<p>「您瞧。」他又把手電筒開了，光綫集中在那個猪玀倒地的所在。</p>
<p>這一團回形光亮，所照明的情景，似乎可以說明天下之大，儘可發生許多「信不信由你」的事跡；地上仰大八叉躺在那裘的副隊長，或說是「猪玀」，手中的槍已經不見了，四肢微微抽搐着，嘴角還流着血，口張得很大，眼珠子突在外面，增加了幾分更猙獰的丰采。</p>
<p>「這兒！」小老虎知道我正在搜尋他致命的所在，用足尖點着那傢伙的頸勃子。這樣子瞧着確也有些肉麻，因為他全部的喉管已經挪動了位子，好像有什麽忽然鈎一類的東西，鈎住之後向外一扯的情形，喉顯的皮肉臃腫墳起掛了下來，有二三寸的一張　地位；把　領　衫的領口，壓住了一隻角。</p>
<p>那個駕駛員，傷在胸口，也好像什麼鐵器，和衣服直搗進去一般，有想當的深度。</p>

<h3>敎會精神</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>在所有宗敎中，基督敎的工作生活行爲，可以說圾人世的了。基督敎徒並不想遯隱山林，更不是斤斤謀求個人的來生，他們雖有進天堂的目標，但他們却認爲必須虛心，哀慟，溫柔，飢渴慕義，憐恤，淸心，使人和睦，爲義而密受逼迫；而社會觀却是無遮攔的愛。</p>
<p>花花綠綠的大上海，甚至即在納垢藏汚的塲所當中，一座佈道所設在那裘，風雨無阻，大門開放，准時講授聖經，儘管祇有一個聽道者，儘管這唯一的聽道者並不是專心而來，却是爲了歇脚和躱雨，但台上人亳不爲異，依然娓娓闡述他那一套。有許多人或認爲這是都市的諷刺，殘酷的滑稽，但日子一久，你自然會被他那種堅毅的精神所感召。</p>
<p>敎會是以服務爲第一要義的，因爲不同凡俗之爾詐我虞爭名攘利，往往會令人從反而去看，以爲他們親切和睦的態度是虛僞，或者有什麼作用，似乎頗可悲哀，但這與他們却並無影響。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，敎會所受的損害很大，勝利後，他們精神抖擻地又重新開始了。有許多外國老牧師老敎士，集中營出來，再回到原先的崗位，像聖的翰大學校長卜芳濟先生，以九十歲的高齡，現在正準備從美國回到，上海來哩這不是一個爲個人打算的入所能理解的。</p>
<p>誠懇，愛人，謙虛，服務，堅毅，這種敎會精神，在這舉世滔滔，見利忘義的混亂社會狀態下，更應倡導。</p>
<h3>在考場裏</h3>
<p>— 史珮</p>
<p>—一個監試員的話</p>
<p>我感覺到驕傲和歡愉，當我從辦公室走出來衣襟上飄着一塊寫有「監試員」三字的紅色證章的時候！</p>
<p>踏進了敎室黑黝黝的一排排都已坐滿了來應考的新生。我在幾百隻焦急的眼光下，帶着裝出來的威嚴站在台上愼重地對他們說：</p>
<p>「字跡有看不淸的可在發下考卷後十分鐘之內問。別的問題一概不答。桌子上椅子上不許放任何的書籍和紙張，請各位注意」！</p>
<p>考卷發下了，帮着我的還有二位和我一樣佩有「監試員」的朋友。我們分站在前·中·後三個地位，並且還不時地走動着。隄購營機地注視着每一張緊張的臉，像是含有敵意似的！</p>
<p>「請注意」！我走了兩圈忽然想起了「請把准考設拿出來」！</p>
<p>於是，像審査什麼似的，我們三人在狹小的座位空隙間擠着，對着每一張照片和他們的臉是否附合！我看到每一張佈滿着汗珠緊張而又愁苦的臉色，我忽然悠到一種說不出的感覺·似乎對於這批忍了熱流了汗來考試的同學們太殘忍了一些吧！然而爲了這一槐紅色證章所引起尊嚴和責任，我不得不査！</p>
<p>題目，說眞的是難得可以，一般考大一的同學我放說很少有得到及格的希望。瞧！那一個個愛慮焦急的臉色，愁眉苦險地，也許他們心裏久懷着的憧憬就要因此而吿吹了吧？</p>
<p>我反握着兩手裝出優開的態度，不時地踱着。有時，我覺得有好幾位同學的眼睛朝我閃電似的掃了一下便又害怕地低下了。怕些什麼呢？我又不是老虎？假如大家同在一個敎室裏求學的話，我們還不是一樣的同學？想到這裏，我憂悒地噓了口氣，輕輕地坐到講台上低下頭，浸在胡思中了！</p>
<p>忽然——</p>
<p>「這怎麽可以帶」？</p>
<p>抬起了頭，祗見另一位「監試員」朝一位搜小的新生這樣地叫起來，手裏緊握着一册講義！</p>
<p>哀求，羞愧的臉色，沒有博到同情。「監試員」無表情地把他的試卷帶了過來放在講台上。</p>
<p>一個苦惱羞紅的臉從我的面前鬱鬱地走過，眼角晶瑩地閃着淚水！</p>
<p>是誰使他這樣的呢？學校？試題？還是「監試員」？在監試員，是爲了盡職，但那舞弊學生，也怪可憐！</p>
<p>爲了限制學額，考題水準特別提高，這在學校當局，目前也是出於不得已，但是學生們因此弄得不知如何是好，實也令人同情！</p>
<h3>學費</h3>
<p>— 昌麟</p>
<p>家長：「開學在即，子女學費無着，吿貸無門如何是好。」</p>
<p>商人甲：「何用多愁、出我借給你好了，拆息照市。」</p>
<p>家長：「鉅額學費，　難負担，能否待小兒學校畢業後，本利一併歸還。」</p>
<p>商人甲：「複利計算，也好……」</p>
<p>商人乙：「照市一角六分計算，借洋一百萬元，十年後本利共計一·〇二八·五七六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·元」</p>
<p>舊事重提</p>
<h3>從榮案想到　二十年來上海綁案</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>榮案主犯駱文慶·袁仲杼等八名、終於由警備司令部執行槍決了。</p>
<p>榮德生的被綁是勝利後上海第一次轟動社會的大綁架案，以五十萬美金贖綁。結果由第一綏靖區司令部第二處長毛森偵獲。其案情的曲折離奇，已散見於各報。由榮案令人通帶地想起上海從前發生的幾次鉅大綁案來。</p>
<p>最早是上海富商朱葆三的女婿魏廷榮的被綁，其次是時報主人黃伯憲的被綁，都是慼傳於於街頭巷尾，作爲撩天好資料。</p>
<p>再後來就是光華大學校長張壽　氏的公十在大西路被綁的新聞了。張氏是時正任財政部次長，照理私行贖票是不可以的，但是張氏愛子心切，終於用鉅款贖出。因此那時的報上登載得隱隱的的，但也不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。</p>
<p>前十五年左右，曾有一時期綁架之風大盛，稍有資產者都不最獨自出外。據說有某氏在馬路上散步時，突有綁匪持槍威脅隨行。走到南京路日昇樓口，某氏忽然情急智生·當衛脫褲小便，被巡捕干涉，扭到巡捕房去，却因此面脫險。</p>
<p>民國二十九年，成爲孤島的上海，變成一恐怖的世界。綁架案件，層出不窮。著名的像十一月間電影明星阮玲玉之夫粵人唐李珊在跑馬應公寓前的被綁，和僞方「中央政治委員會委員」趙叔雍兒子趙典曉的被綁。趙逆之子的被綁，曾勤索二百萬元，後被租界警局會同日憲偵獲，兇犯竟是當時的僞「滬西自衛團」的「團長」。</p>
<p>民國三十年的綁案中，如滬江製銅廠經理金華亭的被綁（此金華亭非已故名記者金華亭，）　業銀行董事張伯駒的被綁，都算是其中的「大焉者」。最受人注意的，是立法委員羅運炎在滬西極司斐而路寓所被敵軍所架。羅氏在戰後息影滬上，熱心敎育事業。綁他的目的在脅迫羅氏發表「和平」文吿，以資號召，日軍行爲卑鄙無恥的一斑，令人髮指！</p>
<p>最近　榮案後，又有福建糖商薛劍秋的綁案，於十四小時內即吿破獲，兇犯章裕燦自稱曾任「浙東游擊司令」。這次綁架，交款約在警察局，肉票竟藏在市政府，眞是膽大包天，可謂「前無古人」，別開生面！</p>
<h3>即將出國的衛立煌</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>人物素描</p>
<p>衛立煌將軍即將赴美考察軍事，並研究新戰一術及新武器。許多人對於衛將軍，都有着深刻的記憶。戰時安徽的省會—立煌，也許大家都不會忘懷，但你可知道它的由來嗎？</p>
<p>十三年前，立煌縣還是一個極荒蕪的小鎭市，當時數萬國軍曾在該鎮進行過一月餘爭奪戰，始終無法攻克，後來最高當局下了一個緊急的命令，限令一週打下，同時，誰要是先打進去，將來這個鎮就易爲縣，縣的名也就用攻入該地的部隊首長的名字。</p>
<p>當時的幾個師長，接到命令開了一個會議，計劃各路的部署，但唯有最艱難的一條路，無人敢去，結果，衛將軍自吿奮勇說：「咱去—」想不到他最先成功了。於是安徵永遠有了立煌這個城。</p>
<p>從那時起，他聞名於全國，事業也蒸蒸日上，由師長而軍長。廿四年八月，榮任蘇浙贛皖四省分區清剿指揮官，廿六年因蔣委員長西安蒙難，在陝處置陝變很有勛績，榮　了國府頒發陸海空軍甲種一等獎章。</p>
<p>抗戰爆發，衛將軍坐鎭晋南戰場，指揮第一戰區各部隊，予敵人以重大的打擊，使日寇在中原戰塲陷於泥淖之中，而簡接地保衛了大西北的心臟—西安。</p>
<p>卅二年，衛將軍奉調昆明，　轉指揮遠征軍，血戰於印緬戰場，凡三年餘；在中英美聯軍並肩作戰中，指揮所部，充分發揚了中國軍隊戰爭的精神·凡是參加印緬戰役的盟軍官兵，沒有一表，現了他那超然卓越的指揮·</p>
<p>因此，他又獲得了美國當局贈予的光榮勛章。</p>
<p>衛將軍平生欣賞兩個人，一個是蘇聯的軍事領袖伏洛希洛夫，一個是法國的福煦將軍。衛將軍之所以成名·當然受他們兩位將軍旅程康樂！</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<h3>郁香嚴投案</h3>
<p>— 重征</p>
<p>失踪兩月之郁査嚴突然挺身投案，替兩路局舞弊案打開了僵局，眞是誰也不會料到的事。我相信，並希望全案將因此而大白。</p>
<p>前兩天，本刊恰巧提到這個問題，曾提供意見兩點：一·郁香嚴應該挺身而出，二·希望聽到下文。想不到次日的報紙上，就看到了「郁香嚴投案」的消息。</p>
<p>如今，我們可以聽到水落石出的消息了，究竟誰是誰非，即將吿白社會。奉公守法的公務員應予嘉獎，貪汚舞弊之徒，必須重辦！這是天經地義？</p>
<p>據郁香嚴在投案後所述各節，牽涉頗多，似乎情節異常複雜。但是，在未得到正式的證據以前，我們不敢妄加評語，一切待法律去探索，去判定！我們除深信當局者必將執法如山，懲罰貪汚外，並希望兩點：一·郁香嚴最好不是該案的主角，而充當該案舞弊的檢舉者與見證人，以符合她自己致本報兩函丙所述各節；二·所云陳局長及警務處與該案的關係，最好不是事實！</p>
<p>報壇逸話</p>
<h3>無獨有偶</h3>
<p>— 鋼果</p>
<p>中西兩大百科全書</p>
<p>本報在英人美査兄弟（Frederic　and　ErnestMajor）經營的時代，曾於前淸光緒十一年至十四年間，用活字版將「占今圖書集成」翻印完竣。這一部一千六百二十八册的巨籍，是我國最重要的百科全書之一，西人稱之爲「康熙百科全書」（Kang　Hsi　Imperial　Encyclopedia而名本報刊印之版爲「美査版」（Major　Bros.　Eoition）</p>

<p>右老德政</p>
<p>我們拍發新聞電的記者們，以及所有的報館和通信社，都要感謝于右任先生所給予我們的便利和利益。</p>
<p>照現在交通部電訊規章的規足，拍發新聞電照尋常電四分之一收費，加急新聞常照尋常電四分之一另加四倍收費（即等於加急商電二分之一的電費）。發電人領有新聞電訊執照，可以由收電人付費。這種的利益和便利，當淸末初通國內電訊時，記者與報社是沒有得享受的。後來新聞電亦僅減收對折。</p>
<p>到民國元年，于右任先生長交通部，才將新聞電照商電減收四分之三。于先生在從政以前，本是新聞界的老前輩，曾手創神州，民呼，民吁，民立各報。他是深切知道報界疾苦的故他在長交部時，特別能顧到報界的福利。我們到現在還是受着他的利益不知還有幾多人曉得他在短期綜綰交通行政時所留下的德政否？</p>
<h3>福爾摩斯　從那裏來（1）</h3>
<p>— 史道哀著　郁強譯</p>
<p>編者按：許多人都知道福爾謂摩斯，都愛看這一類書。但你們可知道福爾歷斯從那裏來？這裏吿訴你福爾摩斯誕生的故事，你願意聽嗎？</p>
<p>一八八六年的倫敦，從表面上看來，和前些年的倫敦很相似。維多利亞女皇始終安然的坐在她的寳座上。保守黨黨魁薩立期賓利爵士再度將他的政敵格拉得斯本從首相席上趕下去。愛爾關被暴動和叛變擾動着；而皮却姆的藥丸，舉世公認爲是治療神經錯亂的特効齊。在文藝界，按作者的年齡來說，居首席的也許是司蒂文生·亨利·傑姆士和亨德（Henty）；但是一個叫王爾德的愛爾蘭人却以唯美派祭酒的身份，使自已成爲幻想時代的典範。在戲劇界席勒（Cellier）的「桃樂賽」正在快樂戲院作第九百六十八次的慶祝公演，「燈塔」在阿德爾菲劇塲明亮的發着光。在畢加地萊，馬車競賽，跑得快而危險。沒有即將爆發的戰爭，遼闊的世界在和平中。這是整潔而快樂的時代，是富足而　滿的時代。也沒有天文現象出現去表示一件紀元的事體。如世界史上不止一次的指示出，一顆藍色的月亮，是異人出世的標誌。確實的，並沒有一顆行星隕落，去吿訴一個住在林資茅斯港南海地方的貧困的鄕村醫生，他已帶領了一位新的不朽的人物，走入文學的世界。</p>
<p>歇洛克福爾摩斯在這時已經到世界上來了。陪着暫在第五諾森姆保蘭聯隊任職的華生醫生，福爾摩斯在倫敦培克街二百二十一號B，租了一棄房間，幹着他驚人的私人偵探的事業·當這世界還被人關注的時期，他便永存在那裏。</p>
<p>深懂偵探的人</p>
<p>南海業林別墅的亞塞柯南·道爾醫生·日子並不好過。這個年靑人新近才結婚，他替雜誌寫文章，獲得些微的稿費，貼補早期醫生生涯的生活。他很可能永遠寫短篇小說而得不到進步。他確信，這是必需的，假如一個人要想成爲作家，必要使自己的名字，登在一本書的封面上。他的第一本小說——格德哥斯東公司（TheFirm　of　Gudlestone　）—是一個悲慘的失敗，那手稿還放在屋子裏。但他時常想，在偵探文學中創作新鮮文體的可能性，嘉寳略作品情節的簡明使他愛好而保重精幹的業餘偵探杜萍是他孩童時代的英雄·關於這些如何？他問着自己。道爾如能將這些帶到偵探文學的園地中去，無疑的將成爲自己的了。</p>
<p>在他的門外，晚上，點着一盞紅燈，這是他的職業的標誌·在白天，那每晨擦洗，刻着他的名字的銅片，光亮的在朴資茅斯陽光中閃耀着·但這兩件標誌所招致的病人却是極少。在候診室中，擺着三把椅子，一張權子，還舖着一小方地毯，當他坐在那裏吸着烟思想時，面前觀現出以前在大學裏的一位敎授的形影—一位叫的瑟夫拜耳，消瘦，强壯，黝黑，高鼻，尖臉，聳肩，眼睛灰而銳利，走起路來很特別的敎授，的瑟夫，拜耳，愛丁堡大學的醫學博士，皇家療養院和皇家兒童醫院的外科醫生，他的音調高而不和諧，他的外科醫術很深奧，他的詭秘的診斷術是醫學院的傳奇，這件事，由等待着並沒有來的病人的年靑的醫生看起來，假如拜耳決定去做一名偵探，他會使「這幻想而無生機的事業，變成近乎完全科學的東西」。</p>
<p>拜耳，爲了道爾這學生永不會完全瞭解的理由，將他從病房裏的一羣同學中調出來，做他的門診助手。這並不是件煩重的職務，他祇需將候診的病人編好次序，記下簡單的病况，再將他們導入一間大房屋內，拜耳就安靜的坐在這屋子裏。但是年靑的道爾立即明白了一件事：拜耳祗要對病人一驚，他所知道的事，就比自已全部由發間而知道的多。</p>
<p>「他坐在他的診斷室內」，小說家時代的道爾寫着，「像一個印地安人·當病人跨進室內，尚未開口時：他就在診斷了。他會吿訴病人，他們的症候如何，甚至會說出他們過去的生活如何，但他很少會錯誤。」</p>
<p>作者吿訴我們，許多結果常是戲劇化。有一次，他觀察一個平民病人說：「噢，你在軍隊中服役吧？」</p>
<p>「是，先生」</p>
<p>「退伍不久？」</p>
<p>「不錯，先生。」</p>
<p>「屬於蘇格蘭高地兵團？」</p>
<p>「是，先生。」</p>
<p>「一位非低級的軍官？」</p>
<p>「是，先生。」</p>
<p>「駐紥在巴培突鳥？「註：英國西印度羣島的屬地。）」</p>
<p>「是，先生。」</p>
<p>「你們注意，各位，」這位醫生向環繞着他的學生和助手們解釋，「這位先生是個恭敬的人物，但是並沒脫掉他的帽子。軍隊中的人是不脫帽子的；似如他退伍已久，就該學會平民的禮節。他的氣槪很有權勢，並且顯然是個蘇格蘭人。關於巴培突島，因爲他的病症是象皮症，這病症流傳在西印度，不列頗見沒有的。</p>

<h3>Preventing the Communist Army from Crossing the Yangtze</h3>
<p>No Southern Boats Allowed North</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 28th] With the war situation in Northern Jiangsu becoming tense, in order to prevent the Communist army from taking the opportunity to cross the Yangtze River southward, the garrison in Changshu has stipulated that civilian boats on the southern bank of the Yangtze River are not allowed to sail north to the northern bank of the river. The northern bank is completely sealed off and passage is prohibited, with the exception of Liuhekou, Qiyakou, Baimaikou, Hupu Town, and Fushan Town. Navigation along the river is allowed from 5:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation Outside Rugao, Northern Jiangsu National Army Recaptures Suining, Communist Army South of Gaoyou Launches Offensive</h3>

The National Army, occupying one-third of Shaobo, was at a disadvantage fighting with their backs to the water and strategically withdrew, shifting their defense line to the area south of Dazha to Qiaoye. It is reported that the total number of Communist troops continuously moving south from Gaoyou has reached over 10,000, accompanied by over 20,000 militiamen. The Communists may use their old tactic of using militiamen as a vanguard to launch an offensive against Yangzhou. A military strategist told our reporter, "With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, we would be very happy if the Communists came bearing gifts." It is also learned that the battle for Shaobo lasted four days, with the Communist army rotating troops four times, each time with 2,000 men, resulting in casualties estimated at over 4,000.</p>

Small groups of several hundred have appeared between Zhanghuanggang and Xilai'an to intimidate the people. A "bank" has been set up in Sihuigang to absorb materials. The "county governments" of Shanghai, Yu, and Rutai are concentrated in Jingjiang, and are very active. However, according to Staff Officer Xing's observation, the future of public security is guaranteed. Rumors have been confusing people recently, and there is no need for alarm. [Another Telegram] The fighting is fierce on the Huangqiao and Rutai highways in Northern Jiangsu. The sound of cannons can be heard clearly in Southern Jiangsu. The situation in Huangqiao was very tense on the 28th, and the National Army has rushed to reinforce.</p>

Zheng Dongguo's troops have set up a command post in Chaoyang, while Zheng has set up a unit in Jinzhou. The strength of the Communist army in Chengde is very strong, but judging from the fact that the Communist army has extensively damaged transportation facilities near Chengde and transported a large amount of materials and equipment out of the city, they seem to lack confidence.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Fierce fighting has also broken out on both sides of Nankou on the Pingsui Railway. The National Army is making smooth progress, and the Communist army is reinforcing its troops between Yongzhuang and Longqiao, the vanguard of Zhangjiakou.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Wuhan Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Organizations of Various Bureaus Merged Separately</p>

<h3>Flying Coal Prices in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Coal prices in Beiping have soared recently. On the black market, coal lumps have risen to 150,000 yuan per ton, and coal powder has risen to 4,000 yuan per 100 jin. This soaring phenomenon is caused by poor supply and hoarding by merchants. It is learned that the heavy rains two months ago flooded most of the coal kilns in Mentougou, resulting in a daily output of only 200 tons, a decrease of four-fifths compared to the normal output. The Weihe Bridge on the Shanxi Bingjing coal mine was destroyed, and the Yangquan coal was also blocked due to the Zhengtai Road. Although the coal was piled up like a mountain, there was no way to transport it out. In addition, the rear service department's storage of coal in Beiping may also be one of the reasons.</p>
<h3>Hebei High Court Schedules Public Trial of Traitor Wang Yitang Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Cheng Qian Scheduled to Return to Hankou Tomorrow, Reportedly Disaster Relief Being Hastened in Hubei Province, Treatment of Officers and Soldiers to be Improved Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Correspondent, 28th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, received reporters at 3:00 PM on the 28th and reported on the western escape of the Communist army led by Li Xiannian and the suffering of the people in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan. After the report, reporters asked if Li Xiannian's troops had any possibility of escaping west. Cheng replied that the Communist army in the mountains between Zhushan and Zhuxi in Sichuan and Hubei now numbered only over 1,000. They have been blocked by the National Army and there is no possibility of them escaping again. A reporter asked if the remnants of the Communist army, if unable to escape again, could establish a new base in the mountains of Zhushan and Zhuxi. Cheng replied that they could not. During the Jiaqing period, bandits occupied the area and harassed it in all directions. At that time, transportation was inconvenient and troop movements were difficult, so that kind of phenomenon occurred. Now, transportation is convenient and it is difficult to occupy the area. Our reporter asked about the organization of the Provisional Headquarters and the treatment of officers and soldiers. Cheng replied that the new treatment will be implemented starting in September, and the lives of officers and soldiers are expected to improve. Asked why Li Xiannian's troops failed this time, Cheng replied that this was a meaningful question. The reason for the failure of the Communist army was that they harassed the people, so most of them escaped voluntarily, while the National Army did not need the local authorities to be responsible for anything. The reason for success or failure lies in this. Director Cheng will meet with the Chairman on the 29th and return to Hankou on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 28th] General Cheng Qian said that all the National Army in the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters jurisdiction had been reorganized as planned by the Central Government. Li Xiannian's troops did not abide by the peaceful agreement and started a riot on June 27th of this year. After two months, countless people were killed, and the people in the border area of Hubei and Henan issued the most tragic cries for help. Later, troops were mobilized to effectively stop them, and the people's armed forces in various counties also rose up to defend themselves. Li's troops have all collapsed. Emergency relief has been stepped up in the areas most severely affected by the Communist army's disturbances. The Chairman has issued the remaining items seized from the enemy and puppets, as well as the food, old clothes, and other supplies from the various stations, to the disaster-stricken counties.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Intensifies Destruction of Railways, Coal Cars Derailed on the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Accidents Occur on the Jinpu, Pinggu and Other Lines</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] Sources in the transportation industry report that as the war expands, the Communist army seems to be intensifying its destruction of railways. Last night and this morning, accidents occurred on the Beining, Jinpu, Pinggu, and other lines. The roadbeds between Tianzhuang Caizhuang south of Tangshan on the Beining Railway and between Chadian and Hangu were severely damaged. Eight coal cars from Tangshan South derailed as a result, and an armored train also derailed. At the same time, more than 300 Communist troops attacked Tianzhuang, and more than 3,000 Communist troops gathered near Tangfang Station to the north, seemingly intending to destroy the road and attack Qigang. Machang on the Jinpu Railway was again fiercely attacked by more than 1,000 Communist troops this morning, and there have been no reports since. Anci County on the Pingjin Road was fiercely attacked by the Communist army last night, and the situation is unclear since then. Two companies of the National Army in Xiancha, 18 li southeast of Huairou on the Pinggu Road, were also surrounded by the Communist army last night, and fierce fighting continued until 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 28th] The railway between Niangziguan and Yangquan on the Shitai Railway, which was destroyed by the Communist army, has been completely repaired since the Railway Bureau ordered workers to rush to repair it day and night. It was originally scheduled to test the train on the 28th, but on the morning of the 27th, the Communist army east of Niangziguan destroyed a bridge at 24 kilometers and 700 meters between Jingxing and Nanyu, and blew up a mountain cave 80 meters long at 65 kilometers. The passenger train that departed from Shijiazhuang on the morning of the 28th turned back at Jingxing.</p>

<h3>US Envoy Meets Zhou Enlai, Exchanges Views on the National Government Committee Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 27th] After returning to Nanjing on the 27th, Special Envoy Marshall had a long talk with Ambassador Stuart, conveying the opinions exchanged with Chairman Chiang in Guling 　 Ambassador's reference for talks with Zhou Enlai. At 4:00 PM on the 28th, Zhou Enlai visited the ambassador and talked for an hour and a half. It is learned that the government side is 　 considering the opinions of Marshall and the Mediation Department and is first discussing the issue of the National Government Committee. Regarding the allocation of seats, the government's opinion is that the Kuomintang should occupy 　 seats, the Communist Party should occupy eight seats, and the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social figures should each occupy four seats. However, it is heard that the Communist Party originally insisted on ten seats and occupied fourteen of the forty seats, which is enough to retain one-third of the veto power. The ambassador conveyed this idea to Zhou when meeting with Zhou, as a basis for continued discussions. According to the spokesman of the Communist Party delegation on the evening of the 28th, today 　 　 exchanged views on general issues only. It was also said that the government side did not give a concrete reply to the two opinions previously raised by Zhou, and that the issue of the National Government 　 　 Committee could not be discussed at present, and that it has now fallen back into a "delaying situation."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Envoy Ma met with Yu Dawei on the morning of the 28th for about an hour and scheduled to meet Zhou Enlai on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] It is said here that British Ambassador Shi 　 Wen, British Prime Minister's Military Representative General Wyatt, and Canadian Ambassador Brigadier General Odren will participate in 　 　 work and strive for peace in China. However, when reporters inquired about the above rumors from relevant authorities, they all failed to confirm them. The British 　 authority strongly denied this statement when receiving reporters on the 28th. He believed that the British ambassador had not been in China for a long time and did not know the Chinese situation very well 　, so he would not participate in this mediation work. It is true that Wyatt and Odren have met with Chairman Chiang many times, but to take on mediation work 　 , the above rumors may have been caused by this suggestion. He also believes that if there is hope for peace in China, then the mediation of Marshal Ma and Ambassador 　 is sufficient, and there is no need to bring in any other third party. (Please read the second 　 for the news of Special Envoy Ma discussing the issue of handling US surplus materials with the US Undersecretary of Commerce.)</p>
<h3>At Foreign Reporters Reception, Minister Peng Talked Freely About the Overall Situation, The Communist Party Only Needs to Shift Its Mind to Immediately Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party held a reception for foreign reporters at 3:30 PM on the 28th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main points of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Expanding the Foundation of Government</p>
<p>Q: Minister, what is the hope of success for the new suggestion of Marshall and Ambassador 　 to reorganize the National Government Committee to include Communist Party members? Will the National Government Committee replace the Supreme National Defense Council?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: Expanding the foundation of the government to include various parties and non-party members has been announced by Chairman Chiang on August 14. The National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council, but this matter must be realized in an atmosphere of harmony and requires the active cooperation of the Communist Party, and not using negotiations as a tool for delay.</p>
<p>Q: Does the Minister believe that the reorganization of the Government Committee can lead to lasting peace?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The government will spare no effort to lay the foundation for permanent peace. If the National Government Committee can be reorganized, it will be a step forward to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Needs, Not Conditions</p>
<p>Q: Can the government be expected to withdraw or reduce its five conditions?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The so-called conditions are only the various needs to restore public order after the new situation caused by the Communist Party's attacks and expansion of territory. These needs cannot be regarded as the government's conditions or requirements. For example, the Communist army recently launched a large-scale offensive by sea and land, occupying many important cities. Under this situation, the retreat of the Communist army to restore the order of Changdi is a need. However, the Communist Party 　 has again promoted it as a new condition or requirement of the government.</p>
<p>Ceasefire Must Be Sincere</p>
<p>Q: What are your views on the Communist Party's written announcement requesting a comprehensive ceasefire and the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: (1) Regarding the comprehensive ceasefire, since the ceasefire order was issued in January, the government has not issued an attack order. In recent months, only the Communist Party has not complied with the agreement, has not respected mediation, and has launched attacks everywhere, expanding the occupied areas, causing chaos to spread. This can be proven by comparing the areas occupied by the Communist army today with the situation when the ceasefire order was issued in January. By observing the full mobilization order recently officially published by the Communist Party, it is even clearer who the attacker is. It is wrong to say that there is no ceasefire. Therefore, the key to stopping the conflict today lies in whether the Communist Party is sincere, whether it is willing to withdraw its full mobilization order, and to withdraw from some areas that have constituted a threat to peace or hindered transportation. The Communist Party only needs to shift its mind to immediately achieve peace, and propaganda cannot cover the ears and eyes of the people of the world.</p>
<p>Striving to Implement Resolutions</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference, the Political Consultative Conference has made detailed resolutions on various issues, not only in principle, but also in terms of plans and steps. The current problem lies in implementing what has already been resolved. Chairman Jiang's statement on August 14 clearly stated the government's policy. The government is now making every effort to implement the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. Therefore, the current problem lies in sincere implementation, not in indefinite discussions. (3) Regarding the expansion of the government, the August 14 statement clearly stated that the expansion of the government foundation must be realized as soon as possible. This means that the reorganization of the National Government should be completed in accordance with the original plan before the National Assembly is held. Once this is realized, it will be difficult for the various parties to resolve various issues within the government in a spirit of harmony. (4) Regarding the draft constitution, the August 14 statement contained the phrase "gather better opinions from all parties" regarding the draft constitution. This point was already stated verbally at the close of the Political Consultative Conference. The exchange of opinions in the Draft Constitution Review Committee is also based on this spirit.</p>
<p>Promoting the Convening of the National Assembly</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the end of political tutelage, the government is eager to end political tutelage and implement a constitutional government. This determination has been declared repeatedly and efforts have been made in practice. It is hoped that certain parties will not misunderstand and distort the importance of the country over the party. The parties should work together with sincerity to promote the convening of the National Assembly, so that the two major goals of democracy and peace can be achieved.</p>

<h3>U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Patterson Arrives in Beijing at Invitation, Discusses Remaining Supplies with Marshall and Lucas, Acheson Denies Using Military Aircraft to Transfer to Our Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall, U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Patterson, and U.S. Military Advisory Group Leader Lucas held talks at the U.S. Military Headquarters here this afternoon, the 28th, lasting approximately one hour. It is reported that the discussions were related to the handling of remaining supplies and other issues. Mr. Patterson is scheduled to leave Beijing on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall received U.S. Assistant Secretary of War Mr. Patterson this morning, the 28th, and held discussions. Mr. Patterson flew from Shanghai to Beijing this morning, the 28th, at the invitation of Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Marshal Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 3 PM this afternoon, the 28th, and spoke for quite some time. It is said that the content of the conversation likely pertained to the U.S. remaining supplies issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th Dispatch] Acting U.S. Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that the rumor in Shanghai that the Foreign Liquidation Commission had handed over ten (B-25) aircraft to the Chinese government was considered untrue. The State Department has ordered the Foreign Liquidation Commission to investigate the responsibility for transferring remaining supplies to China in violation of regulations. He stated that the United States has transferred combat supplies to many countries with the approval of the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but this measure has been discontinued for China.</p>
<h3>Mitchell Bombers, Eleven Deemed Scrap Metal, Dismantled by U.S. Military Personnel at Jiangwan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Amidst recent widespread rumors of the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission illegally selling bombers, U.S. Army personnel stationed at Jiangwan Airfield suddenly dismantled eleven B-25 Mitchell bombers of the type originally sold to the Central Air Transport Corporation yesterday morning. Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Flight Operations Department of the Central Air Transport Corporation, after personally inspecting Jiangwan Airfield, told reporters: "These bombers were originally unable to fly. U.S. personnel, to ensure that they could not fly, cut them in two with electric torches on the morning of the 28th, severing them completely. However, the components, radios, instruments, etc. inside the aircraft, as specified in the contract, are still complete and usable, and our company will send personnel to dismantle them gradually, while the scrap aircraft can still be used as scrap metal."</p>
<p>To clarify the truth about the aircraft purchase and demonstrate that the purchased aircraft were no longer suitable for military purposes, the Central Air Transport Corporation originally planned to invite reporters from various newspapers to Jiangwan for on-site observation at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, when more than ten reporters arrived in a Central Air Transport Corporation truck, they were suddenly stopped by the military police guarding the airfield and not allowed to enter. The reason given was "urgent orders had been received." According to the explanation of Director Chen Wenkuan, this misunderstanding was due to insufficient prior communication. Chen's original intention was to gather reporters from various newspaper offices in the city and take them to Longhua, from where they would fly to Jiangwan by plane to avoid the heavily guarded U.S. military police at the entrance, who were unaware of the situation, from stopping them abruptly. However, the truck driver mistakenly took the reporters directly to Jiangwan, so they were still blocked outside the airfield. After learning of this in the afternoon, Chen Wenkuan immediately flew to Jiangwan Airfield himself and negotiated via radio. After obtaining permission, he landed and inspected the site. According to Chen's inquiry, the U.S. military security officer in charge stated that they were in fact very willing for reporters to visit, and that the previous situation was a misunderstanding on the part of the guards at the gate. What Chen saw at the time was a pile of bomber wreckage.</p>
<h3>McBride Statement</h3>

The aircraft are no longer suitable for flight. The Liquidation Commission will closely monitor whether the conditions of the contract are fully implemented."</p>

<h3>Xiao Zheng Proposes to the Central Government to Implement Land Reform with "Land to the Tiller" as the Principle</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the Chinese Land Administration Society, recently proposed to the central government the implementation of land reform to permanently consolidate unification and achieve genuine democracy. This reform is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of "land to the tiller" as its basic spirit. The main points are as follows: (1) In the future, when agricultural land is transferred (through sale, donation, inheritance, etc.), the "acquiring party" (i.e., the buyer, donee, or heir) must cultivate the land themselves as a necessary condition. Otherwise, the government or self-cultivating farmers have the right of first refusal to purchase, and land financial institutions may lend funds to purchase the land; (2) For all non-self-cultivated land, the government may, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law, implement requisition by district, compensating for the price of the land, and reorganize this requisitioned land into standard farms, which will be issued to the original cultivators with priority or to other farmers willing to cultivate the land themselves; (3) All land requisitioned and redistributed to farmers by the government should be organized into cooperative farms; (4) In pacification areas where land boundaries have not been destroyed and land rights have not undergone major changes, the original landowners may legally retain their property rights, but they may not collect rent or other demands. To realize the "land to the tiller" policy, the government may requisition this land and redistribute it to the original cultivators; (5) In pacification areas where land boundaries have been destroyed or land rights have been illegally distributed, if the original owners can provide proof of ownership and are not self-cultivating farmers, the current cultivators may continue to cultivate their land and should apply to the local land administration agency to purchase it. The purchase price will be fairly assessed by the government and paid by the cultivators over 15 to 20 years in agricultural products; (6) In pacification areas where land boundaries have been destroyed or land rights have been distributed, if the original owners can provide proof and request to reclaim the land for self-cultivation, it should be returned to them, and the value of the crops or other improvements should be assessed and compensated by the original owners to the current cultivators. This land may not be leased again, otherwise it may be confiscated; (7) In pacification areas, farmers who have no land to cultivate after land rights have been sorted out may apply to the government for land allocation, pay the land price in installments in agricultural products, and then obtain ownership of the land; (8) Ownerless and public land in pacification areas should be allocated by the government to farmers for cultivation; (9) When implementing land reform, it is necessary to simultaneously implement rural autonomy, with county and township autonomous organizations responsible for execution and supervision. In other words, to use land reform to enable farmers to actually participate in politics, and to use this as the foundation for true democracy and permanent unification of the country.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Plans to Establish Ever-Normal Granaries to Stabilize Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] In order to control grain prices and regulate supply and demand, the Ministry of Food plans to establish ever-normal granaries in major cities after the autumn harvest this year. According to the person in charge of the ministry, after the establishment of the ever-normal granaries, the government can stabilize the market at a reasonable price, releasing grain when prices are too high and purchasing grain when prices are too low, so as to reach a certain standard.</p>
<h3>Branches of the Agricultural Bank of China in Various Regions to Handle Rice and Grain Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Qiao Qiming, Director of the Agricultural Loan Office of the Agricultural Bank of China, stated that this year's harvest has been plentiful in various regions, and grain prices have fallen. If farmers sell rice and grain in large quantities at this time, they will inevitably suffer losses. Branches and offices of the Agricultural Bank of China in various regions have been ordered to handle rice and grain loans. If farmers need to turn around funds, they can deposit their grain in the bank's agricultural warehouses, borrowing 50% to 70% of the current market value, with a monthly interest rate of 0.3%.</p>
<h3>Construction of Branch Roads of the Pinghan Railway to Begin in October This Year</h3>

In order to complete the project as soon as possible, it has been decided to build the section from Huayuan to Zhangjiawan first.

<h3>Existing Judges in Various Regions Will Not Temporarily Avoid Their Native Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The issue of judicial officials avoiding their native places was previously finalized by the authorities.

The Ministry of Justice investigated that there are currently nine provinces where High Court presidents and chief justices must avoid. In order to avoid confusion, no changes have been made for the time being. In the future, when new personnel are transferred, they will resolutely comply with the order to avoid. Existing personnel can be gradually changed.</p>

<p>Seabed Accumulation Allows Walking Across the River</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the 25th, a passenger car from Haining to Changan passed through Hu Jiadou. Two passengers got on the car and said that they had walked from the opposite bank of Sanchedai after lunch, only taking a Sanban boat for about half a mile in the middle. The rest of the way, due to the excessive seabed accumulation, the boat could not travel, so they had to wade over ten miles. Walking across the Qiantang River from Sanchedai has never been heard of before, which shows one aspect of the collapse of the Qiantang seawall and seabed accumulation.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Will the United States Change Its China Policy?</h3>
<p>The United States' sale of surplus materials to China has surprisingly provoked clamor and protest from the Chinese Communists (中共), who claim that these surplus materials "include American military weapons, ammunition, wireless communications equipment, and other equipment stockpiled in places like Okinawa and the Philippines." This kind of fabricated "beautiful lie" is not worth arguing over in the first place; however, the United States is a democratic country and must issue a statement to deny it. The statements issued yesterday by U.S. Army General Peterson and State Department Foreign Clearance Commissioner McCabe have completely dispelled the doubts surrounding this issue. They solemnly declared that there are absolutely no military weapons, firearms, aircraft, or other military supplies in the materials sold to the Chinese government; and that these surplus materials are purely for civilian use and will be of great benefit to China's recovery and peacetime economy. After hearing this stern statement, what else can the Chinese Communists say?</p>
<p>The post-war international policy of the United States is clearly based on two major foundations: first, the occupation of Germany and Japan to eliminate the remnants of fascism, so that their aggressive forces can no longer rise again; second, the support of the United Nations organization, to make it an effective tool for maintaining world peace, and the willingness to assist countries that faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Logically, the United States should no longer sell armaments to other countries after the end of the war, but the United States, based on the above reasons, still sells armaments to Britain, France, China, the Philippines, and some Latin American countries. Accordingly, even if there are armaments and ammunition in these surplus materials sold to China, it does not conflict with the keynote of American international policy. The clamor and protests of the Chinese Communists will not sway the United States' China policy. Therefore, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson said yesterday in a diplomatic tone: "Whether the current U.S. China policy will change? It is not possible to announce at this time."</p>
<p>In the U.S. State Department, there are many diplomats with long-term vision. All policies and plans are decided after careful study. In the process of implementing policies, no matter what difficulties and obstacles are encountered, they only redouble their efforts to adhere to their original intentions and rarely change course when faced with difficulties. Taking its China policy as an example, there has been no change since President Truman issued a statement in December last year. Whether it is sending special envoy Marshall to China to mediate the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communists, or appointing Stuart as the ambassador to China, the consistent policy of the United States is to hope that China will become a unified, democratic, and strong country, and can be the only stabilizing force in the Far East? And do more to maintain peace in the Far East. Therefore, the true intention of the United States in selling surplus materials in the Western Pacific to China is to help China's recovery. However, the Chinese Communists, with ulterior motives, believe that the United States has other intentions, and launch a propaganda offensive, inciting people everywhere to oppose the United States. Fortunately, the eyes of the Chinese people are discerning, and they can clearly distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood, right and wrong, black and white, as well as benefits and harms, gains and losses. Therefore, standing from the standpoint of the people, we once again advise the American government and the public that the Chinese Communists' clamor against the United States is definitely not the public opinion of our 450 million people; and that the people across the country are only sincerely grateful for the United States' sale of surplus materials to China to help our country's recovery and nation-building, and hope that this matter will be completed as soon as possible. How can there be any reason to oppose it!</p>
<p>The Turmoil in the Islamic World</p>
<p>In today's situation, where the situation in Europe is turbulent and uneasy, and relations between the great powers are repeatedly strained, there is also a brewing storm in the Near East. The issue of the Dardanelles Strait has just been raised, and the Ukrainian representative has accused Greece of endangering peace in the Balkans. Relations between the United States and South America have been on the verge of explosion due to the United States' proposal of the "Act of Chapultepec." Now, this series of European problems has not yet been resolved, and new developments are emerging in the Near East. Although we do not need to speculate on how these new developments will unfold in the future, the news coming from the Near East is quite worrying. A broadcast from San Francisco on the 28th said that civil war in Iran is likely to break out within two weeks, and negotiations between the government and Azerbaijan have reached a deadlock. From the Middle East to the Near East to the Far East, the entire region is not a land of peace; from Egypt to India, it is filled with the smell of gunpowder, and there are religious struggles and Anglo-Soviet conflicts everywhere. In northern Iran, Soviet troops are concentrated, while British troops have occupied the southern border, with their fleets cruising or anchoring in the Persian Gulf. At the same time, the Kurds of Iraq are negotiating with the Soviets to establish a Kurdish state, in an attempt to open up the Near East corridor and connect to Basra in the Middle East through Turkey's Dardanelles.</p>
<p>At this time, the British government announced that it would hold a meeting in London on September 9 with Arab and Jewish representatives to discuss the Palestine issue. The British Foreign Office announced that invitations had been sent to the governments of Arab countries, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine. Although this meeting is to discuss the Palestine issue, the fact that all Arab countries have been invited undoubtedly allows for incidental discussion of the situation in the Near East. What is noteworthy here is that, according to a United Press dispatch, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem had colluded with Hitler during the war and was detested by the British. British officials had previously publicly stated that they were unwilling to invite him to participate; however, the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine believed that the committee's chairman, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin El Husseini, should be one of the representatives, and this prerequisite remains in effect. The so-called Grand Mufti is a title in Islam. This person, Haj Amin El Husseini, had echoed the British army in the First World War, launching the Arab nationalist movement against Turkey. However, in the Second World War, he was against the British. Now, at a time of turmoil in the Arab world in the Near East, it may be necessary to have someone like the Grand Mufti to support Britain's attempt to stabilize the Near East, especially since he made a considerable contribution to Britain in the First World War.</p>
<p>From the above description, it is not difficult for us to see how turbulent the situation in the Near East is. The state-building movements of Azerbaijan and the Kurds need to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and it goes without saying that they are backed by Moscow. Since it supports the Kurds, it will inevitably weaken Iraq, which is centered on the Arab people; and Iraq gained independence under the support of Britain. At this time, the invitation for representatives of Arab countries to gather in London will enhance the relationship between Arab countries and Britain. From this, it can be seen how Britain and the Soviet Union are engaging in intrigue, using their wisdom and means to enhance their respective positions in the Islamic world of the Near East. This struggle is not limited to the Near East. Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia are all interconnected.</p>
<p>In the past, Mussolini once styled himself as the "Protector of Islam;" Hitler also did not forget the Arabs living in the rich oil regions, and sent his Deputy Prime Minister von Papen as ambassador to Turkey in order to establish closer relations with the Arabs in the Islamic world. Now, both Mussolini and Hitler have been defeated; however, the Arab countries in the Islamic world of the Near East still have rich oil fields, and there are many Islamic national republics affiliated with the Soviet Union in Soviet Central Asia. What will happen to the Islamic world, from India to North Africa, in the future is really worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>In India, because the Muslim League led by Jinnah refused to participate in the interim government led by Nehru, the attitude of the Muslim League and the development of the situation in India will be of concern to those who care about the situation in India. In Iran, the situation has been tense for quite some time, and the problem has not yet been resolved; in Iraq, there is the Kurdish state-building movement; in Turkey, there is the issue of the Dardanelles Strait; in North Africa, there is the issue of the transfer of former Italian territories; and even in Tunisia, there is unrest among the so-called "Pan-Arab" activists. The entire Islamic world is in turmoil, and in this turmoil, we see reports of civil war in Iran breaking out within two weeks, and reports of Britain convening a conference in London and issuing invitations to Arab countries. Putting these events together, we can see the subtle and complex international relations behind them. In the Islamic world, we see a head-on collision between the interests of the so-called "Western European bloc" and the interests of the "anti-Western European bloc." Only when the turbulent Islamic world can be stabilized can the entire world be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Military Reception Personnel Liu Naiyi Arrested for Corruption: Concealing Over 1 Billion Yuan in Japanese Gold and Cash, Numerous Pearls and Gold Treasures Found in Residence</h3>
<p>[Report from Tianjin by this newspaper on the 28th] The main culprit in the major corruption case involving military reception personnel uncovered in Tianjin by the investigation team, Liu Naiyi, Naval Captain and Director of the North China Naval Commissioner's Office, was arrested on the 27th. It is reported that the investigation team had received secret reports in peacetime, stating that Liu had concealed 2,000 taels of gold and 100 million yuan in cash belonging to a Japanese resident named Osasa, and embezzled other materials. It is estimated that the total amount is close to 1 billion yuan. When the team arrived in Tianjin to listen to the reception reports from various units, Liu left Tianjin for Beiping, but later returned to Tianjin. After extensive investigation of this case, the investigation team determined that Liu was indeed suspected of major corruption. On the 26th, they sent a letter to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and with the instructions of Director Li, senior staff officer Lu Jiqing of the Executive Headquarters in Tianjin consulted with the team to handle the matter. On the 27th, with the cooperation of the military, police, and gendarmes, the investigation team first arrested and detained Liu Naiyi, and divided into four groups to start an investigation at his residence at 118 Dihua Road and two other houses and offices. At that time, more than 500 pearls, 17 gold ingots, 8 pairs of gold bracelets, and more than 50 leather jackets were found in his residence. There were also several safes that had not yet been opened. The investigation was temporarily suspended at about 1:00 AM on the 28th, and three groups continued the investigation after 8:00 AM. As of the time of sending the telegram, the investigation had not yet been completed. The suspect Liu was transferred to Beiping on the afternoon of the 28th, or will be transferred to the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing for trial. It is reported that the Japanese resident Xiao Sa, who owned the gold, had already been repatriated back to his country.</p>
<p>[Report from Beiping by this newspaper on the 28th] The investigation team uncovered two cases of police station corruption and dereliction of duty in Beiping. According to investigation, the Outer Second District Police Station of the Beiping Police Bureau had forged guarantees and illegally transferred enemy and puppet grain. Wu Qian, the director of the Southern Suburbs Police Station, had abused his power and used the name of investigating the property of traitors to privately accept gold, silver, jade, antiques, and other items, and had continuously defrauded a total of more than 14 million yuan, both attempted and completed. Both cases have been investigated by the investigation team, and there is solid evidence.</p>

<h3>Accelerate the Work of the Paris Peace Conference: The Four Foreign Ministers Will Meet Today; Belgian Foreign Minister Returned to Paris from London Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive news from this newspaper] Paris, 28th broadcast: Tomorrow at 4:00 PM, the foreign ministers of the four major powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France: Byrnes, Molotov, Bevin, and Bidault, will hold consultations on the current situation of the peace conference. France responded to the invitation from the United States and Britain this morning by inviting the three powers to a meeting at the French Foreign Ministry. The Soviet Union's response was submitted on Tuesday. The nature of the meeting is "informal." Whether there will be similar gatherings in the future will be decided by the four foreign ministers.</p>
<p>London, 28th broadcast: British Foreign Minister Bevin arrived in Paris this afternoon to arrange the meeting of the four foreign ministers. The convening of this meeting was initiated by the British side. The meeting will be held at the British Embassy or the French Foreign Ministry. According to a United Press dispatch, the meeting of the four foreign ministers was convened at the request of the Canadian Prime Minister by British Foreign Minister Bevin to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 28th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers, but stipulates that this meeting is of an informal nature, and each foreign minister may only bring two experts. It is recalled that when the last meeting of the four foreign ministers was held, this relatively tight method was used, and a compromise solution was reached on the Trieste issue. This meeting is not open to the press, but due to Byrnes' insistence, it was decided that all resolutions would be published immediately afterwards.</p>
<h3>Review of the Draft Treaty with Italy: The Peace Conference Achieved Concrete Progress; Several Regions on the Italian Border Were Ceded to France</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] Today, the peace conference made its first concrete progress in a month in reviewing the peace treaty. The Political Committee on Italy unanimously passed the first section of the peace treaty with Italy, ceding the Saint-Bernard Pass in the Alps to France. Italy also agreed to this. Italian representative Saragat claimed that Italy had formally agreed to cede four small border areas to France, including Tenda and Briga. However, regarding the high ground of Cenis, he requested that the conference amend the decision of the four powers.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 28th] The head of the Italian delegation, Saragat, stated his views at the peace conference today, saying that Italy and the United Nations fought together for two years, which can offset their past mistakes. Italy is making every effort to restore friendship with France, but according to the draft peace treaty, revising the French-Italian border will cause Italy to lose Mount Cenis, Mount Chaberton, and the Roia Valley, which is unreasonable from an economic and ethnic point of view. Saragat left the meeting after finishing his speech.</p>
<h3>Australian Representative Withdraws: Recommendation to Establish Two Committees</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] Today, the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union adopted the same position, opposing Australia's proposal to establish a compensation committee and a special review committee for territorial changes. However, the three countries reprimanded the Soviet delegation for attacking the Australian delegation and questioning the motives of the Australian delegation. In view of the inevitable failure of the above proposals, the Australian representative withdrew them. Therefore, the four-power agreement on compensation and territorial changes remains in its original form in the draft treaty. However, the Australian delegation reserves the right to inquire in the future how much each former enemy country will compensate in total.</p>
<h3>Political Committee on Romania: Passed the Preamble to the Treaty</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 27th] The Political Committee on Romania of the peace conference met today and passed the preamble to the draft treaty with Romania.

As for the second part of the amendment proposed by the Australian representative, which is about guaranteeing the rights of minorities, it was decided to reserve it for future discussion. A memorandum submitted by Romania, proposing to change the date of the country's entry into the war from September 12 to August 24, was rejected. The Ukrainian representative proposed an amendment, advocating that Romania be recognized as a co-belligerent and demanding that the treaty explicitly state that the country had fought against Germany and Hungary.

<h3>South Africa Will Demand the Merger of Southwest Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Johannesburg, 27th] At the UN General Assembly, South African Prime Minister Smuts will request that the mandated territory of Southwest Africa be merged into the Union of South Africa. The compelling evidence he will present will be the results of the vote by the residents of Southwest Africa in favor of the merger. It is reported that since March of this year, the South African authorities have sent people deep into various parts of Southwest Africa, asking the natives to answer the question of "whether they support merging with South Africa." The natives did not understand the meaning of this move and thought they were changing another type of ID card, so they rashly expressed their support and affixed their fingerprints. The Southwest Legislative Assembly recently formally passed the merger with South Africa. These two results will undoubtedly be powerful documents to support Smuts' request. The British government's attitude is that if the local residents do support the merger, then Britain will support Smuts' request at the UN General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Amid the Unease and Instability in the Balkans, the U.S. Fleet Will Visit Greece, Stationed in the Aegean Sea overlooking Turkey, and the Soviet Ambassador to Greece Was Suddenly Recalled</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive news from this newspaper] According to Reuters, Washington, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" will make a courtesy visit to the port of Piraeus in Greece from September 5 to 9, accompanied by the 10,000-ton cruiser "Little Rock," the destroyer "Cone," and the "Corry." At the same time, the U.S. destroyers "Noah" and "Warrington" will visit Thessaloniki. The commander of the U.S. Navy visiting Greek seaports is Rear Admiral Cassedy, commander of the carrier fleet of the Atlantic Fleet. The "Roosevelt" arrived in Naples today. According to United Press, the United States has decided to send a fleet to visit Greece, which is now the focus of a new Soviet diplomatic offensive. This display of naval power is still officially called a "courtesy visit," but diplomatic circles believe that this U.S. fleet will be stationed in the Aegean Sea, overlooking Turkey, and also making the population of the Dardanelles Strait, which the Soviet Union covets and jointly protects, just a shot away. This move also closely follows Ukraine's accusation in the UN Security Council that Greece is a danger to Balkan peace, and its significance is even more obvious.</p>
<p>According to United Press, Athens, the Soviet Ambassador to Greece, Rodionov, requested the Greek government to issue a passport on the 28th so that he could return to his country with his family. According to diplomatic circles, this move was at the government's request. Greek officials also attach great importance to this request, as it occurred on the eve of Sunday's referendum on the empire. Other parties frankly announced that Rodionov's request is part of the pressure exerted by the Soviet bloc on Greece, and it is also a prelude to the Soviet Union's possible non-recognition of the Greek imperial government that will be produced by Sunday's referendum.</p>

The United States and the United Kingdom opposed the admission of Albania and Outer Mongolia, while the Soviet Union opposed the admission of Portugal, Ireland, and South Ireland. France opposed the admission of Siam. The use of the veto power by one country immediately triggered retaliatory use by another. Paris, 28th (Emergency Broadcast from Lake Success, USA): Siam has requested that the review of its application to join the United Nations be postponed.

<h3>Heated Debate in Jewish Association Regarding Attendance at London Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 28th (Broadcast from London): A heated debate has erupted within the Jewish Association regarding participation in the London Conference, and a resolution is expected soon. According to London newspapers, the British Colonial Office may invite the World Jewish Organization "Agudath Israel" to attend the conference, an organization opposed to Jewish nationalism. A Colonial Office spokesperson declared this morning that "Agudath Israel" is in contact with the department regarding the issue of representatives attending the conference, but it seems that the only unresolved matter concerns the specific individuals involved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch]: The Palestine Conference will be convened in London's Lancaster House starting September 9. Whether the conference proceedings will be open or closed has yet to be decided, but it seems certain that the representatives of the Arab and Jewish sides will be seated separately. The British Foreign Office believes there is little possibility of journalists being allowed to attend the conference debates. The British side will act as an intermediary between the Arab and Jewish sides. It is not yet known whether the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem will personally attend the conference. The Foreign Office hinted that Azzam Pasha will be invited to attend in his personal capacity as Secretary-General of the Arab League.</p>
<h3>Doihara Secretly Planned Everything, Abducting Puyi to the Northeast, Prosecutors Presented Relevant Documents Yesterday, Gear Described the Japanese Army's Drug Operations in Shanghai, Manager of Pudong Electricity Company Also to be Summoned as Witness</h3>
<p>[Gōdō News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Today, the prosecutors at the International Tribunal presented documents related to Puyi's schemes. On November 3, 1931, the Consul-General in Tianjin, Kuwashima, sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Shidehara, reporting on a conversation with Doihara, stating that Doihara met with Puyi on the night of the 2nd and informed him that the Kwantung Army had decided to support Puyi as Emperor, forming a defensive alliance with Japan, and that the Japanese Imperial Family also welcomed the revival of the Qing Dynasty. Puyi seemed quite moved. On November 13, the Consul in Niuzhuang, Arakawa, sent a confidential telegram to Foreign Minister Shidehara, stating: "According to the captain of the Awaji Maru, Doihara secretly transported Puyi from the concession in Tianjin to the dock by car, guarded by soldiers carrying machine guns. He boarded a speedboat and headed to Dagu, then transferred to the Awaji Maru." On November 17, Kuwashima sent a telegram to Shidehara stating: "Doihara's purpose in coming to Tianjin is to fulfill the wishes of the Kwantung Army, plotting to quickly oust Puyi, striking at Zhang Xueliang's power, as a prerequisite for Manchurian independence. He is determined to disregard any advice and will take free action independently by the Kwantung Army, even if it violates national policy." On November 26, 1931, Yano, a secretary at the Japanese Legation in Beiping, sent a telegram to Shidehara, reporting that the famous spy Kawashima Yoshiko, on the orders of the Kwantung Army Staff Officer Itagaki, had secretly come to Tianjin disguised as a man, plotting to take the "Empress Dowager Xuantong" to the Northeast. On November 27, the Consul-General in Tianjin sent a telegram to Shidehara, reporting that the military had notified them that "Empress Dowager Xuantong had secretly escaped" on the 26th and would take the Changshan Maru to the Northeast on the 27th. With the presentation of these documents complete, the examination of Puyi came to an end. Next, Englishman Frank Gear testified. Gear served as a policeman in the Shanghai Municipal Council after 1934, working on narcotics issues and is currently employed at the British Consulate General in Shanghai. Gear stated that before the Sino-Japanese War, opium sales were prohibited, but the Wang puppet regime undermined the laws upon its establishment. Next, Tong Shoumin, manager of the Shanghai Pudong Electricity Company, was summoned to testify, describing the economic aggression of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Semenov Confesses, Conspired with Japan to Seize Siberia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] Semenov, a 56-year-old White Russian counter-revolutionary leader, was arrested in the nine eastern provinces of China and is being tried by a military tribunal along with seven of his accomplices. All of them are charged with espionage, terrorism, and waging war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has been waiting for an opportunity to capture Semenov for nearly thirty years. He succeeded Admiral Kolchak as the leader of the White Russian Guard, a Siberian counter-revolutionary group. The ages of the defendants vary, up to 70 years old, including 51-year-old Ukhtomsky, a former prince of the Tsarist era. During his trial before the military tribunal, Semenov confessed that he had maintained close collusion with Japan throughout World War II, established a large-scale spy network, and conspired to seize all of the Soviet Union's Asian territories for Japan. He allegedly colluded with Japan for over 25 years, aiming to launch a counter-revolution, destroy the Soviet regime, and once participated in a plot to assassinate Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders.</p>
<h3>Australia Suggests to Relevant Countries the Establishment of a Pacific Regional Conference, Success Depends on U.S. Attitude</h3>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 27th] Today, sources close to the Australian government stated that Australia has proposed to relevant countries the organization of a Pacific regional conference, with its headquarters in Australia. The British and New Zealand governments have expressed strong support. Other countries invited to participate include the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal, and perhaps China as well.

Well-informed sources say that a meeting of the British Empire's autonomous territories may be held here in January next year to discuss Pacific issues, and concrete decisions are expected to be made at that time.</p>
<h3>Behind the Soviet Government, Stalin Exerts Absolute Power, Poskrebyshev is His Eyes and Ears</h3>
<p>In recent international events, almost every event is related to the Soviet Union. The importance of this polar bear's position is evident. On August 19, Time magazine published an article on the overview of the Soviet domestic regime. This article is translated for the readers.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov once said, "Everyone who can read and write can understand the Soviet Union." But what is the reality? The political organization of any country is always different in form from its actual style. This difference is greater in the Soviet Union than in any other country, because the Soviet Communist Party is the government hidden behind the Soviet Union, and it controls the nominal Soviet government.</p>
<p>The leader who holds all party, government, and military power is the leader of the Soviet Union, Stalin. The Red Army is directly under his command. At the same time, because of the organization of the Red Army Political Department, the Communist Party can monitor the actions of the Red Army.</p>
<p>Stalin has his own personal secretariat headed by General Poskrebyshev, who was promoted last month. His duties perhaps best illustrate the Soviet approach. Foreigners who go to see Stalin have all encountered him, because he sits in the outer office of Stalin's office - bald, short, and looking like a barrel. Stalin organized his private secretariat when he competed with Lenin. Since then, this secretariat has specialized in collecting information about Communist Party members who may resist Stalin. Within the circle of the Communist Party, they all call this general "the wolf-swallowing louse" behind his back.</p>
<p>According to the Soviet Constitution, power is from the bottom up, but in reality, it is from the top down. The leader's louse is one of the reasons for this.</p>
<p>The party currently has six million members, which is 3.5 million more than six years ago. They elect the All-Soviet Communist Party Congress, and from this Congress emerges the Central Committee, which has 71 members plus 68 alternate members. During the recess between the two congresses, this committee guides all party affairs. Under the committee are three agencies: (1) the Politburo, composed of 14 people, which decides all domestic and foreign policies, perhaps the largest group in the world; (2) the Organizational Bureau, the agency that executes party policies; and (3) the Secretariat, the agency that manages the Organizational Bureau.</p>
<p>The two houses of the Supreme Soviet government are elected by 120 million voters (the Soviet population is 200 million). The two houses meet twice a year. During the days of the meeting, you can see these deputies applauding and unanimously protecting. During the recess, their duties are performed by the Presidium. The Presidium is composed of 33 people, and the current chairman, Shvernik, is a member of the Politburo.</p>
<p>The highest administrative management agency in the Soviet Union is the Council of Ministers. The current chairman and eight vice-chairmen are all members of the Politburo.</p>

<h3>Citywide Street Vendors Jointly Petition, Mayor Firmly Refuses, Believes Many of the Goods Sold are Stolen, Decides to Strictly Ban Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Since the municipal government announced that it would ban street vendors starting September 1, more than 5,000 street vendors in the city gathered at Xikou Road (Zhu Bao Road) at around 9:00 AM yesterday to jointly petition the municipal government. They were stopped by military police at Jiangxi Road and turned to Guangdong Road, Henan Road, Minguo Road, Zhonghua Road, Fangxie Road, and Daji Road to gather at the Public Sports Field. They elected three representatives, Liu Rulin, Su Ruofei, and Li Hongru, to go to the municipal government at 11:15 AM to request an audience with the mayor to personally submit a petition. After receiving them, the mayor rejected the street vendors' request, believing that the street vendors were not small businesses and that some of them had capital of more than 10 million yuan, and that many of their goods were stolen from wharves and warehouses, so they could not be considered. At 3:00 PM, the three representatives of the street vendors also petitioned the administrative office of the police bureau, but were also rejected. Before the municipal government decided to ban the city's street vendors, it received a telegram from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on August 20, which stated: "It is found that on June 23 this year, the association convened a membership meeting of the ninth district. According to the joint proposal of various guilds such as department stores, southern goods, toothpaste, tooth bone ware, iron pots, pottery, western clothing, commercial auctions, and flower and tree businesses, the suggestion to ban street vendors is roughly as follows: Setting up stalls on the road has long been on the list of bans, which not only detracts from the appearance but also hinders hygiene. Recently, huge capital has been used to sell smuggled or stolen bulk goods from the docks, and no taxes are paid on the profits, which affects national tax revenue and store business. Please forward this to the municipal government for strict banning. The association has reported the situation and requested adoption and implementation, but has not yet received approval. Therefore, we re-telegraph and request that the government approve the implementation for public convenience. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce." Upon receiving this telegram, the municipal government immediately issued the following instructions: "The telegram has been read. It has been decided that street vendors on the roads in this city, except for those selling cigarettes, newspapers, snacks, and books, who are allowed to set up stalls in places that do not obstruct traffic, will not be allowed to set up stalls without permission starting September 1st. This has been announced to the public on the 20th of this month, and the police bureau has been ordered to implement the ban in earnest. This is hereby notified." Mayor Wu decided at a municipal meeting that after banning street vendors, he ordered the police bureau to instruct each sub-bureau to send personnel to persuade the street vendors in their respective jurisdictions to change their profession within a time limit, starting from the date of the order, and not to make mistakes. According to the municipal government, it will strictly implement the ban on street vendors in this city starting on September 1.</p>

After this change, the road money has increased a lot, and it is much more convenient for those who want to go to the North Sichuan Road area, but in order to take into account the burden on passengers, the authorities will not increase the fare for the time being, and the entire line is still 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, I have obtained definite news from relevant parties: The fast and slow lanes of the East Zhongzheng Road-West Tibet Road to the Bund in this city will be announced by the Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Police Bureau for operation in accordance with regulations starting today, that is, motor vehicles should drive on the fast lane, and pedicabs, tricycles, etc. should drive on the slow lane.</p>
<h3>Trekking Through Mountains and Rivers to Transport Salt, Only to End Up Losing Money: Salt Merchants in a Distressed Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As the saying goes, "There's no place like home, and no salt like the world's best!" Salt holds the fourth position among the seven necessities of daily life. Every meal requires salt. Everyone eats salt, and every household uses salt, but how many people know the details of salt?</p>
<p>According to estimates by several salt merchant alliances: The monthly salt consumption in this city was around 50,000 *zu* a month ago. The main consumers are soy sauce workshops, preserved meat and food businesses, and pickled vegetable producers. Most electroplating factories have shut down due to the dumping of foreign goods. Otherwise, the amount of salt used for industrial purposes would be quite substantial, and the monthly consumption would certainly be more than the currently estimated 50,000 *dan*!</p>
<p>Originally, the difference between official and private salt was only whether or not taxes had been paid. Salt that has been taxed is generally called official salt. Otherwise, it is private salt. Currently, most of the edible salt used in this city is official salt that has been taxed.</p>
<p>Currently, the main source of official salt is a batch of *Wen-Tai* salt stored by the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance that was seized from enemy and puppet regimes. It is said that this batch of salt is of low quality and dark in color, but the warehouse price is still 16,500 yuan per *dan*. The Salt Affairs Office has warehouses, one in *Pudong* and one in *Nanshi* *Gua Jie*. If the goods are shipped from the *Pudong* warehouse, the price per *dan* to Shanghai would exceed 18,000 yuan. It is said that this batch of stored salt is almost completely distributed.</p>
<p>The sources of salt from other ports include *Yuyao Chang*, *Biao-Pu Chang*, and *Dai-Shan Chang*. Among them, *Yuyao Chang* has the most abundant production, but unfortunately, it lacks transportation tools, making it difficult to transport and sell. The salt produced in these places is all fine salt. Most of the salt imported is taxed locally. There is also a batch of coarse-grained *Huai-Lu* smuggled salt, which comes from *Shandong* and northern *Jiangsu*. Most of the producing areas of this batch of salt are under the control of the Communist army. General transporters often adopt a barter trade method to exchange goods. Usually, after the salt arrives at *Wusongkou*, taxes are then paid for import. Currently, the largest suppliers to this city are still *Dai-Shan* and *Huai-Lu* areas.</p>
<p>It is said that the cost of salt produced in *Yuyao*, *Biao-Pu*, and *Dai-Shan* is only 6,000 yuan per *dan*. However, the salt tax per *dan* is over 8,000 yuan, plus transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the price of each *dan* to Shanghai already exceeds 17,000 yuan. Furthermore, the cost of *Huai* smuggled salt is 11,000 yuan per *dan*, and after arriving in Shanghai, it needs to be taxed over 6,000 yuan, so each *dan* also costs 17,500 to 17,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Speaking of private salt, because the salt police force is insufficient, it has not been completely eliminated. Moreover, the quantity is indeed considerable. It is said that this batch of private salt is also smuggled out of various salt-producing cities without paying taxes. However, precisely because it is private salt, it has undergone layers of "black eats black" extortion and blackmail during the process of coming to Shanghai. The cost to Shanghai also amounts to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per *dan*. Most of this batch of private salt is landed on the long beaches of *Pudong*, collected by salt dealers, and transported to the city for sale. Since the prices of salt transported to Shanghai from various places are fixed at 17,000 to 18,000 yuan per *dan*. On the one hand, the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office is infinitely allocating and selling salt at a price of 16,500 yuan per *dan*. Salt merchants can apply for allocations, and soy sauce workshops, preserved meat shops, etc., can also directly apply for allocations. In this way, the transport merchants are suffering, and what can they rely on to make a profit? Trekking through mountains and rivers to transport salt, only to end up losing money. As a result, one after another, they stop business and quit. In their distressed situation, they harbor a resentment, which is that they hope that the salt authorities will have a reasonable adjustment to the salt price, especially starting from suppressing and reducing salt taxes, so that salt merchants can still have a bite to eat, and citizens can eat affordable salt!</p>

<h3>Victory Celebration Troop Appreciation Committee Continues to Solicit Comfort Items</h3>
<p>The General Assembly of All Circles in This City Celebrating the Victory of the United Nations and Appreciating the Troops has been scheduled to be held at the *Majestic Theatre* on the morning of September 3rd at 9 a.m. The Preparatory Committee held a second meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday morning to discuss the continued solicitation of comfort items.

<h3>The *Gui-Sheng* Ship Re-Clears Customs: Departing North Yesterday Without Loading Cargo or Passengers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The *Gui-Sheng* ship of *Jardine Matheson* re-cleared customs yesterday morning and set sail at 11:30 a.m. None of the cargo or passengers from Shanghai were loaded, and even the relief supplies dispatched by the Joint Relief Association of this city were rejected. Only 90 passengers traveling from Hong Kong to *Qingjin* and a small amount of transshipment cargo were transported to *Qingjin*.</p>
<h3>Two Trade Associations Achieve Close Cooperation</h3>
<p>It is also learned that *Chen Pan-jun*, Chairman of the Customs Brokerage Association of this city, received a letter from the Shipping Association the day before yesterday, requesting that he advise all customs brokerage firms not to report the shipment of domestic goods on foreign ships, so as to jointly maintain shipping rights. He immediately convened an emergency meeting of the industry, and *Chen Pan-jun*, together with *Liang Guan-wu*, *Bao Hai-ping*, *Gan Zi-zhang*, and *Dai Bing-li*, met with *Li Yun-liang*, Secretary of the Shipping Association. *Chen* stated that with respect to the declaration of British ships by various customs brokers, the goods had been delayed for nearly a month, and most of them were food. The famine in the north was urgent, so it was necessary to transport them north for relief. Reporting on British ships was a last resort and not a lack of protection of shipping rights. He hoped that the Shipping Association could cooperate with the Customs Brokerage Association to provide convenience to the customs brokers by various shipping companies, so that they would not report on foreign ships again. *Li* said that he had repeatedly sent letters to various shipping companies to that effect. Through close cooperation, the final instruction was that all goods returned by the *Gui-Sheng* ship could be reloaded onto the *Zhao-Shang-Ju Gong-Xing* ship, *Zhong-Lian* and other companies' *Guo-Lian* ships, as well as the *Fu-Sheng* and *Lin-An* ships, etc., which could all be transported north before the end of the month. At this point, the Shipping Association and the Customs Brokerage Association have reached a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>Improving Traffic Control to be Implemented Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>In view of the unbearable traffic congestion in this city, which often causes blockages and inconvenience to the public, the Municipal Authority has repeatedly convened traffic meetings to discuss solutions. It is learned that various traffic control measures have been decided to be implemented from September 1st. Mayor *Wu* has specifically scheduled a traffic meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow to submit the schemes and measures decided at previous meetings for final decision. Such as one-way traffic routes, strengthening traffic control, separate regulations on the driving time of various vehicles, and restrictions on the driving of trams, *lao-hu* cars, and handcarts, etc., will all be decided at that meeting. In order to make the public understand the traffic control situation, a traffic publicity week will be held from September 1st to 7th, during which the Public Utilities Bureau will post charts and regulations in various places.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Labor Situation to Begin on September 1st</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shanghai is a hub of industry and commerce, with more factories than any other part of the country. After the victory, there has been no thorough investigation and statistics on the labor situation in this city, and the government has little reasonable basis for handling labor-capital issues to provide parameters. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Government Statistics Office have therefore invited eight agencies, including the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Executive Yuan, the Central Bank, the Economic Research Office, the China Textile Corporation, and the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, to organize the Shanghai Municipal Labor Situation Investigation Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at the Social Bureau on August 17th of this year, and *Wu Kai-xian*, Director of the Social Bureau, was elected as Chairman, and *Chen Da*, Professor of *Qinghua University*, was elected as Vice Chairman. Under the Committee, a Technical Committee was established to design, research, investigate, and statistical work. It is reported that the investigation expenses are jointly subsidized by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs with 50 million yuan, and the remaining participating agencies jointly subsidize 30 million yuan. The investigation period starts from September 1st and is stipulated to be three months. Thirty investigators are separately dispatched by the participating agencies, and it is also reported that they have begun working at the Shanghai Municipal Government Statistics Office on the third floor of the Municipal Bank on *Jiujiang Road*.</p>

On the first night, the craft was anchored near *Longtan River*, 73 miles from *Wusong*. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, a burst of gunfire was heard, and the sailors on board were awakened from their dreams. Initially, it was rifle bullets, followed by light anti-aircraft artillery shells, which landed 100 yards from the ship's surface. The shells came from the north. Captain *Kwick* closed the starboard windows. The craft was attacked four times that night before dawn.</p>
<h3>Loud Alarms in *Huangpu District*: Police Officers Mobilized to Block Roads: "Capturing Three Thieves": Afterwards, a Performance Was Announced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] All the businesses, shops, and residents in the *Huangpu District* have completed the installation of alarms. The police department officially accepted the completion yesterday. Deputy Director *Du Wang*, together with the Chief of the First Division *Wang Liyan* and the Chief of the Second Division *Zhou Guanghui*, led police officers to inspect them one by one in the district last night at 8 p.m. The results were good. *Zhu Feng-xiang*, Chief of the Communications Section of the Municipal Police Department, also participated in the event, and ten volunteer police officers also enthusiastically participated. More than half an hour after the inspection was completed, the alarm at *Jinfeng Hardware Store* at No. 295 *Beijing Road* reported a theft case. The alarm rang loudly in the bureau, and the chief of the branch bureau personally led uniformed, plainclothes, and volunteer police officers to mobilize all important road intersections and strictly blocked them off. Some police officers bravely rounded up the suspects. After a search, one suspect was apprehended. According to his confession, there were two accomplices, who had fled south along the *Bund*, and described the clothing of the two criminals, one wearing a Zhongshan suit and the other wearing gray shirt and pants, both around 25 or 26 years old, one taller than the other. He then used a street telephone to report to the branch bureau, and the branch bureau chief dispatched additional reserve police officers to intercept them at *Lingling Road*. Within a few minutes, the two suspects were immediately captured. After taking them to the bureau, Branch Director *Du* announced that this was a "fake performance." The three suspects apprehended were all disguised as the branch bureau. The first purpose was to test the alarm; the second was to test the effectiveness of the street telephone; and the third was to test the agility of the police officers.</p>
<h3>US Military Tribunal Separately Trying Two War Criminals: *Watanabe* Claims Previous Confession Records Were Mistranslated</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The *Hok* case continued yesterday morning at the US military tribunal, with the questioning of the two defendants, Major *Watanabe Masamori* and Major General *Fukuchi Shunnan*. Chief Inspector *Dewey* questioned *Watanabe*, showing him a record of his confession during the interrogation in June of this year, stating that the trial of *Hok* was unfair. However, *Watanabe* claimed that it was the result of mistranslation by the translator and his own excessive nervousness. He also stated that after receiving a telephone notice from the War Crimes Office of MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, he surrendered himself because he firmly believed that there was nothing unfair about the trial of *Hok*. Otherwise, he could have absconded in Japan. Major General *Fukuchi Shunnan* testified that his order to try *Hok* was on the order of the Japanese Operations Department and again submitted a letter of request from the then-Chief Justice *Saborn Shii* to the Deputy Minister of the Tokyo Operations Department as evidence. Yesterday morning, the defendant's defense repeatedly accused the prosecutor, with Colonel *Bolding* accusing Major *Dewey* of obliterating the facts with sophistry. *Dewey* replied with a sarcastic tone: "The defense lawyers are all lawyers and not ignorant infants," and said that there was a female writer *Emily Halm*'s husband, Major *Charlie Box*, who was imprisoned by the Japanese army in *Stanley Prison*, Hong Kong. This person was proficient in Japanese, and the Japanese military court should have allowed him to defend *Hok* in order to reduce the unfairness.</p>

<h3>*Xi-Shan* Train Extended to *Changzhou Station*: Effective September 1st</h3>

In order to meet the actual needs, the bureau has decided to extend the route of the train to *Changzhou Station*. The fare for Shanghai to *Suzhou* is 7,700 yuan for first class and 3,900 yuan for second class. The fare for Shanghai to *Changzhou* is 10,100 yuan for first class and 5,100 yuan for second class.

<h3>High Tide in the *Huangpu River* Next Month: Boats Could Be Sailing on Land</h3>
<p>According to the tidal forecast released yesterday by the *Huangpu River* Dredging Bureau, a high tide will occur in the *Huangpu River* on the 11th of next month, reaching a height of 12.45 feet. According to the fact that the *Huangpu River* has been dredged less in recent years, if the tide is slightly high, the river water will flow back out of the hazard ditches on the various roads. As yesterday afternoon, the tide was not too high, but the river water had already flowed back up, and such phenomena occurred in low-lying roads such as *Guangxi Road* and *Guizhou Road*. Once a high tide occurs, the labor will be in vain.</p>
<h3>Three Threatening Letters Sent to the Catholic *Leisi* Elementary School</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The *Leisi* Elementary School, founded by the Catholic Archdiocese at No. 36 *Sichuan South Road*, suddenly received three threatening letters from the 25th to the 28th of this month, instructing the school principal, *Xu Zong-ze*, to immediately dismiss *Ye Cheng-huai* (33 years old), a teacher of more than six years, otherwise the school would be burned down with "sulfur bombs." *Ye Cheng-huai* reported the letter to the police station last night and requested an investigation. It is reported that general speculation is that it may be the mischief of naughty students, but the truth is being thoroughly investigated.</p>
<h3>Thief Outcries "Catch the Thief!" Golden Bracelet Robber Caught</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 4 p.m. yesterday, a customer came to *Zhenhe Silver Store* at No. 24 *Jinling Middle Road* carrying a paper package and placed it on the counter, claiming to want to buy a golden bracelet. The shop assistant showed four golden bracelets, weighing more than four taels. Unexpectedly, after the customer obtained the above jewelry, he turned around and ran away. The shop assistant chased after him. The thief, in desperation, came up with a clever idea and, while running away, shouted "Catch the thief!" to confuse passersby. He was eventually arrested by the sentry. The original stolen goods were found on the spot, but there were no weapons. After being detained and interrogated by the Taishan Branch Bureau, he confessed his name as *He Ren-fu*, 32 years old, from *Xiaoshan*. He was forced to take this measure due to unemployment.</p>
<h3>*Yu Xiang-yan* Makes False Accusations: Police Department Debunks Them in One Sentence</h3>
<p>*Yu Xiang-yan*, the female mastermind in the *Road Bureau Grand Embezzlement Case*, tried to threaten *Chen Bo-zhuang* unsuccessfully. After being detained, she falsely accused *Chen Bo-zhuang* of extorting 5 million from *Zhang Hong-tu* and the police department of embezzling more than 7 million in stolen goods. According to the person in charge of the police department, speaking to a reporter from *Hua-Che-She* yesterday: The truth about *Yu*'s false accusation of *Chen Bo-zhuang*'s extortion will come to light one day, so there is no need to defend it now. As for the accusation that the police department embezzled 7 million in stolen money and only handed over 3 million to the court, it is even more absurd. The department recovered more than 66.8 million in stolen goods this time. This amount of stolen money was ordered to be handed over to the Road Bureau in full, and the 15 criminals and all the files were transferred to the District Procuratorate. The stolen money was never transferred to the court, so the accusation is self-defeating. In addition, the District Procuratorate's investigation of the entire case is nearing completion and is currently drafting the indictment, which will be formally filed within a few days.</p>
<h3>Scheme to Steal Gold Bars: Clever Use of the "Golden Cicada Sheds Its Shell" Tactic</h3>
<p>At approximately 11 a.m. on the 26th, at the *Da-Dou-Cheng Silver Store* on *Nanjing Road* in this city, two customers, a man and a woman, arrived carrying a net bag containing several stacks of thousand-yuan notes. After the man entered, he first asked the clerk to show him a gold bracelet for inspection, but immediately returned it. He then asked to see a large gold bar, placed the net bag on the bench, and claimed that the light in the store was too dim. He took it to the door to inspect it, while the female customer remained seated in the store. After five minutes, the man had not returned to the store, so the employees in the store anxiously went out, but the man had already escaped without a trace. Upon closer inspection of the money brought by the man, in addition to a few thousand-yuan notes on the surface, there was actually a glass cup wrapped in white paper. The employees then realized that they had been scammed. The clerk immediately reported the situation to the Huangpu Branch Bureau and took the woman who had come with him to the bureau for questioning. According to the woman, her name is *Zhang Mei-ying*, 23 years old, from *Wusong*, and she is currently a hostess named *Wang Mei-ying* at the *Tian-Yun-Lou Night Garden*. She said that she had only met the man the night before, so she did not even know his name. Coming to *Tian-Dou-Cheng Silver Store* was also at the invitation of the man the night before, and so on. The police bureau is intensifying the pursuit of the mastermind of this scam.</p>
<h3>The Taskforce for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets Inspects Military Supply Warehouses: Preservation is Complete, No Signs of Rotting</h3>
<p>The Taskforce for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the *Su-Zhe-Wan* area held its regular meeting yesterday morning. Director *Zhang* and all the members were present, and the work of the taskforce was reviewed. Regarding the *Sun Tian-chang* case, it was decided to transfer it to the court for investigation. When a reporter asked Director *Zhang* whether the 50-day work deadline would be extended, he replied, "All the cases investigated by our taskforce will be handled as quickly as possible within the prescribed time limit. As for when we will go to *Hangzhou*, it has not been determined yet." The taskforce will immediately begin investigating the corruption case of the China Textile Corporation. At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, Director *Zhang*, together with Committee members *Wu Wang-ji*, *Zhang Qing-zhen*, *Liu Gong-yun*, Director of the Bureau for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the *Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui* Area, and Special Commissioner *Zhao Zhi-yao* of the former Ministry of Military Affairs, accompanied them to inspect the military supply warehouses. The inspections covered three parts: supply storage warehouses, medical material storage warehouses, and ordnance storage warehouses. Generally speaking: (1) The stored supplies, such as military uniforms, military clothing, grass-green fabrics, as well as cotton quilts, cotton wool, mosquito nets, mattress covers, etc., are very well preserved and there are no signs of rotting. (2) In addition to American medicines, the medical material storage also contains some medicines seized from Japan. The Military Medical Department has not yet decided how to deal with them. (3) The stored ordnance is extremely well preserved. Explosive military supplies are stored separately and are inspected regularly. The management is better than that of ordinary warehouses. Due to time constraints yesterday, the inspection could not be completed, and the inspection will continue this afternoon. Regarding some of the non-public necessary medicines seized in the medical material warehouse, the National Defense Ministry's Military Medical Department will establish a Research Association for the Disposal of Seized Japanese Goods to study the disposal methods. The Health Department of the First Supply Area Command is actively preparing for this, and the Bureau for the Recovery of Enemy and Puppet Assets will be invited to discuss the matter together. It is also reported that the relevant agencies will also discuss the disposal methods for military supplies attached to customs in the past and some non-military supplies stored by the Joint Logistics Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Female Performer Yuan Xuefen Suffers Unusual Experience, Accuses Colleagues of Prank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yuan Xuefen, the famous Yue opera star performing at the Star Grand Theater, was traveling in her private chartered car at around 10:15 AM yesterday morning. As she drove along Jing'an Temple Road into Gaoshiman Dance Response Lane, intending to reach a certain residence, a thug, lying in wait at that location, suddenly appeared. Holding a chamber pot filled with feces, he poured it over Yuan's head, leaving her soaked from head to toe and surrounded by a foul odor. The chauffeur, witnessing the scene, immediately stopped the car and gave chase, but the assailant fled towards Xieqiao Lane. Afterwards, Yuan reported the incident to the newly established Chengfen Police Station. Director Zhuo of the station personally questioned her, finding no existing grudges. She stated that she had been in Shanghai for many years and had never offended anyone. However, recently, Yue opera colleagues were planning to organize a "Yue Opera Professional Association" and invited her to initiate it. Because she was unwilling to participate, she incurred the dissatisfaction of her colleagues, perhaps leading to the hiring of a rogue to carry out this prank.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Raise Rice Prices, Eight More Found During Investigation</h3>
<p>After the foreign exchange adjustment, the city's grain market has been calm and normal due to the authorities' sale of foreign rice. However, a few unscrupulous rice merchants are still arbitrarily raising rice prices. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate and found eight shops, including Yongchang, Fulong, Zhu Hengyu, Dachang, Yongyuantai and its branches, Zhou Shixin, and Xieji, charging prices ranging from 64,000 to 68,000. The persons in charge of each store will be summoned for questioning. According to Mr. Huang Jiaju, a specialist committee member of the city government, speaking to a Dazhong News Agency reporter, "I was ordered to inspect various districts and found that a few rice shops were marking up prices unreasonably. In addition to the Social Affairs Bureau ordering corrections, I sincerely hope that the residents of this city will report any violations at any time. Anyone who raises rice prices will be severely punished."</p>

<h3>Murder Case in Pudong, Court Conducts Preliminary Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Yangsi Bridge National Self-Defense Force Punan District Third Brigade Seventh Company Third Squad headquarters was located at No. 47 Dangli Village, three miles north of Yangsi Town. It had a total of 50 members and 16 self-provided rifles. However, late at night on June 15 of this year, a group of armed thugs broke into the unit, demanding that all members hand over their weapons. However, the Self-Defense Force had already been ordered by the city government to disband its organization, and the guns had already been handed over to the Shanghai Headquarters in full. Therefore, the demand could not be met. The group did not believe this, and searched separately, but still found nothing. The thugs then tied up the squad leader, Xi Langting, and the squad leaders Zhu Miaoxiang, Xi Jielang, Tao Yi, and Pan Yuxiang, and then took them to a nearby rice field, where they were shot and killed. Two members, Xi Liangdong and Zhu Mingquan, were seriously injured. However, squad leader Ju Xilin, who was absent that night, was hiding at the home of relatives on Qiujiang Road in the city, was suspected. He was arrested by the Yangsi Bridge Police Sub-bureau. Yesterday morning, the case was given preliminary hearing at the District Procuratorate. Xi Liangdong and Zhu Mingquan, who had recovered from their injuries, both appeared in court to testify. As a result, the court adjourned for further review.</p>

<h3>First Unfortunate Incident After Teachers' Day: National School Vandalized</h3>
<p>Thousands of Elementary School Students Demand Admission, Unsuccessful</p>
<p>The No. 16 Central National School on Tanggu Road, etc., in this city, was originally a Japanese elementary school. In February of this year, the City Education Bureau ordered Ms. Jin Qijing, a native of Hangzhou, to be appointed as the principal. After Principal Jin took over the school, she devoted herself to reorganization, expanding the classrooms to 22, which could accommodate 1,000 students. After the end of the last semester, Principal Jin prepared to hand over the school due to funding problems. She was instructed by Director Gu to encourage her to continue her efforts in education, and she began to recruit new students. Recently, private school tuition fees have been high. The school stipulates that no tuition fees will be charged, so the number of new students who signed up for the examination reached more than 2,200. The school authorities, in addition to continuing with 600 old students, had a quota of only more than 300 students. Yesterday, the list of newly admitted students was announced, and more than 300 new students were admitted. There were still 1,900 students who were not on the list, so they jointly asked Principal Jin, "We all want to study, please help us, Principal"! Principal Jin was so moved to tears when she heard the innocent children's requests, but the classroom capacity and economic problems made it difficult to accept them. She gave a brief speech to the elementary school students, urging them to go home. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a few students poured in, and doors, windows, desks, and benches flew around, causing great losses. Later, Principal Jin reported to the Minhang Road Police Sub-bureau, and Director Wang ordered several police officers to go to the school to maintain order and investigate the extent of the losses in order to report them.</p>
<p>[Another News] At the Municipal Penglu Elementary School, because there were too many students applying for this year, some students could not be accommodated. When the names of the new students were announced this morning, a few students surrounded the school and demanded admission. The Education Bureau immediately sent two inspectors, Song Zijing and Xu Jintao, to rush to the school to persuade them. The police bureau also sent personnel to maintain order and notify the parents of each student. They dispersed in the evening.</p>
<p>According to an educator, this is the first unfortunate incident after Teachers' Day. Vandalizing school equipment and surrounding the school is caused by many elementary school students demanding admission but not being able to get it. This is an unprecedented scandal and a disgrace to the country. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly raise education funds, establish more national elementary schools, and accommodate as many school-age children who are eager to study as possible so that such unfortunate incidents will not happen again.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Orders All Districts to Investigate People Wounded or Killed During the Resistance Against Japan All Districts Should Investigate, Compile, Fill Out, and Transfer Reports for Review</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received a telegram from Minister Wei Shili of the Ministry of Internal Affairs: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, people in various places have been aware of the seriousness of the national crisis and the urgency of the nation's crisis, and have risen up to save the country. Some have been loyal to their duties and generously gone to their deaths. Some have assisted the national army and served in the border areas. Some have been arrested and unyielding and have resisted and completed their chastity. The various acts of loyalty, courage, and chastity are enough to move the wind and rain and move ghosts and gods. At a time when the great enemy has surrendered and lost land has been recovered, how to commend the dead and how to comfort the relatives of the loyal and martyrs must be universally investigated and handled separately in accordance with the law, in order to comfort the souls of the loyal and inspire them. The telegram attached the investigation form for people wounded or killed during the resistance against Japan. The municipal government has ordered all district offices under its jurisdiction to investigate, compile, fill out, and transfer reports to the Ministry for review. Because it has been a long time, the reports filled out by various districts have been few. Yesterday, another order was issued to urge reporting in order to transfer them.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Inspection Committee Mobilizes Public and Education Personnel to Participate in Inspection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Candidate Qualification Review Committee, in order to mobilize citizens to actively participate in the review, recently stipulated that each "Bao" (neighborhood unit) in the urban area must have 20 qualified reviewers, and each "Bao" in the suburban area must have at least 15 qualified reviewers.

Furthermore, yesterday, letters were sent to the municipal party headquarters, the Shanghai branch of the Youth League, and various bureaus and offices, urging party, league, government, school, and people's organization staff to take the lead in participating in the review.</p>
<h3>Filling Stinking Ditches in the Thirteenth District</h3>
<p>Several stinking ditches in the vicinity of Yaoshui Lane and north of Anyuan Road in western Shanghai were formed by the discharge of sewage from nearby factories and shantytowns. During the summer months, evaporation causes a foul odor to spread, and mosquitoes and gnats breed prolifically, easily leading to epidemics. Moreover, it is often heard that pedestrians accidentally fall into them at night. It is now reported that the "Bao" chiefs of the relevant 24th "Bao" and others are initiating collective measures to fill these ditches, based on the district's formulated guidelines for implementing environmental hygiene.</p>
<p>Installing Water and Electricity Pipes</p>
<p>Most residents of Yinghua Lane in western Shanghai are workers. Originally, they obtained their drinking water from water pipes installed by factories. Recently, due to factory cost-cutting measures, these small pipes were cut off. The "Bao" chiefs of the 18th and 19th "Bao", along with district people's representatives, convened a "Bao" residents' assembly to raise funds and openly tender for water and electricity projects. The district sent personnel to supervise the process. The outcome of the meeting was quite satisfactory, and it is reported that the project is now actively underway.</p>
<p>Establishing Literacy Classes</p>
<p>The district has been promoting a literacy campaign and has convened several joint meetings of school principals, "Bao" chiefs, and local education enthusiasts to discuss the implementation of the work. Many proposals have been put forward and implemented. It is recently reported that participation in the classes has been very enthusiastic, with 20 classes tentatively scheduled to begin soon.</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>

The vacant position of "Bao" chief will be temporarily filled by Sun Chengfu, the deputy "Bao" chief of the "Bao".</p>
<p>The positions of deputy "Bao" chief in the 21st "Bao" and the 30th "Bao" of the 12th District have been vacant for a long time. It is now learned that the district office has nominated Pan Zuxing and Hu Tingsheng to fill these positions, and the nominations were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval yesterday.</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers on the Household Registration Law (Continued)</h3>
<p>(46) Question: If two brothers establish new households due to separation, should the original household be canceled, and should each of them re-apply for household establishment and registration?</p>
<p>Answer: One household should remain as the head of the original household, or register changes in family members. The other household should re-apply for household establishment and registration.</p>
<p>(47) Question: When processing "Baojia" (collective responsibility system) matters, are students, soldiers, and prisoners subject to household registration investigation? If not, should they process household registration and personnel registration?</p>
<p>Answer: Temporarily, they do not need to process it.</p>
<p>(48) Question: When registering households, should all eight items specified in Article 99 of the Household Registration Law be registered?</p>
<p>Answer: During registration, the items related to the registration event should be registered according to the provisions of that article. For example, for registration of changes in the head of household, registration should be done according to the provisions of Item 1 of that article.</p>
<p>(49) Question: Does the term "collateral relatives" in Article 100 of the Household Registration Law, in addition to spouses, include other relatives by marriage?</p>
<p>Answer: Direct relatives, in addition to spouses, do not include other relatives by marriage. If relatives by marriage are also permanent members of the household, they should be included in the category of other family members.</p>
<p>(50) Question: If a civil servant or merchant residing in another county already has a permanent residence in this county and has lived here for six months, but their stay is uncertain due to work, can they establish a temporary residence?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they can establish a temporary residence.</p>
<p>(51) Question: According to the provisions of Article 93 of the Household Registration Law, when personnel registration matters cause changes in household registration, it should also be registered in the corresponding household registration book.

<p>Answer: Yes, it can be waived.</p>
<p>(52) Question: What should be the unit for the household registration of people in a Governing Bureau?</p>
<p>Answer: A Governing Bureau is a preliminary institution for preparing for the establishment of a county. Central and provincial single-item regulations refer to counties, cities, and bureaus interchangeably. Therefore, the status of a bureau is equivalent to that of a county or city, and the household registration of people within its jurisdiction should naturally be based on the bureau as the unit.</p>
<p>(53) Question: The establishment, removal, and relocation of temporary residence are not specified in the law. Should they be handled according to the provisions of Articles 45 to 50 of the Household Registration Law?</p>
<p>Answer: The transfer of temporary residence should be handled according to the procedures for transferring permanent residence as stipulated in Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Household Registration Law. Therefore, the establishment, removal, and relocation of temporary residence can be handled by referring to the aforementioned legal precedents and following the provisions of Articles 46 to 50 of the same law.</p>

This is partly because cooperation between private and state-owned mills is limited to specific yarn allocation plans, while how to supply cloth is still under consideration. Furthermore, more cotton cloth than cotton yarn is shipped to other cities. According to sources at the Textile Construction Corporation, listed prices for distributed goods will definitely be maintained, but procedures will be adjusted to benefit actual users and reduce speculation. Therefore, purchase applications received yesterday were processed separately for producers and retailers. The approved purchase quantities had to be announced by 7:00 or 8:00 PM that afternoon, and payment was required the next day. The collection agency has been changed to the Bank of China, which shows progress compared to past practices. Sources close to private cotton mills say that they have decided to assist the Textile Construction Corporation in centralized, open, and fair-priced distribution of yarn, which will be implemented the day after tomorrow. The amount is set at 20,000 pieces, allocated to each mill according to the number of spindles and looms. A specialized committee established by the guild will handle the allocation. Purchasers must first apply to the yarn mills they have dealt with in the past. After the mills approve the quantity, they will submit it to the guild, which will set the price and allocate the goods. The price must be approved by the Textile Construction Corporation and announced that afternoon. According to market sources, the total amount of yarn distributed by private mills this time will be issued in the form of forward-dated warehouse receipts. Whether these warehouse receipts can avoid becoming speculative tools is still a concern. Well-informed sources say that much of the floral cloth distributed to the yarn mills by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) a month ago has not yet been settled for foreign exchange. UNRRA has repeatedly demanded settlement based on the new exchange rate, which would inevitably increase the cost of cotton yarn. Therefore, the yarn mills are hesitant about selling at fair prices. Several mills have submitted written complaints to UNRRA, requesting settlement at the old exchange rate, but have not received a response. It is rumored that they will submit a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting continued support. They also say that if calculated at the new exchange rate, the cost of ordinary 20-count yarn, including factory depreciation, is around 1.2 million per piece.</p>
<p>[Another report] Wu Weijing, the deputy general manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, told reporters yesterday that although the yarn market has risen slightly since the exchange rate adjustment, the quantity and price of yarn and cloth allocated by the Textile Construction Corporation have remained unchanged. When Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was in Shanghai, he convened a meeting of the heads of various private yarn mills to discuss cooperation between state-owned and private yarn mills to suppress yarn prices. Recently, the heads of the relevant yarn mills have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss the establishment of a joint distribution agency. After the establishment of this agency, state-owned and private yarn mills will jointly supply cotton yarn for distribution in order to suppress yarn prices. The Textile Construction Corporation will take a leading role in suppressing prices and will strive to cooperate in distribution to stabilize yarn prices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Textile Construction Corporation's tenth auction includes various fabrics, undershirts and pants, cotton-wool undershirts and pants, cotton yarn, cotton blankets, and a batch of miscellaneous goods, divided into twelve groups. Yesterday, a notice was issued to invite tenders for purchase. The deadline for paying the deposit is 12:00 noon on August 30th. Viewing of the goods will be from 1:00 to 6:00 PM on the 30th and from 8:00 AM to 12:00 noon on the 31st. Bidding will be from 1:00 to 3:30 PM on the 31st, and it is scheduled that the bids will be opened in public one hour after the bidding deadline.</p>
<h3>Numerous Market Rumors Lead to Uniform Plunge in Gold and Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors suddenly surfaced that the government would nationalize gold, causing widespread unease. Coupled with constant pressure, prices gradually weakened. From a weak opening of 2.18 million in the morning, it was immediately surrounded by selling pressure. Although it struggled for a while, it fell to around 2.125 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank distributed 82 gold bars at a price of 2.12 million, but the market remained weak and unable to recover. Near noon, it broke through the 2.1 million mark, struggling around 2.085 million at noon. In the afternoon, it continued to fluctuate around the same level. As a result, it fell 85,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was down 22,000, silver remained unchanged, and silver dollars declined slightly. The black market exchange rate was tight due to gold and currency settlements, various taxes, and tight monetary conditions. Interest rates were around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also faced various unfavorable speculations, and the situation was bleak. US dollars opened at 3,410 yuan and gradually declined. Although there was a slight pause in the middle, the overall trend was difficult to resist, and it fell to a low price of 3,330 yuan near noon, before stabilizing. There was arbitrage activity in the afternoon, and it rose to around 3,360 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 45 yuan compared to the previous close. The ratio to gold was calculated at 620 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars fell slightly by 35 yuan due to remittances. Hong Kong exchange rate was 720 to 730 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 870 to 880 yuan, British exchange rate was 11,650 yuan, and the US exchange rate remained at the listed price.</p>
<h3>When Can the Public Bond Mystery Be Solved?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two major players, "Five-Story" and "Seven-Story," continued to be active in public bonds. The buying side was extremely excited, and trading was brisk, with a total of over 4 million yuan. "Tong Bing" bonds opened at 1,650 yuan. Although they once fell to below 1,550 yuan after the opening, buyers immediately became active and gradually pushed the price up to 1,920 yuan, at which point many closed out their positions. The price then fell back to below 1,850 yuan near the close. "Jia Yi" bonds rebounded from 900 yuan to 1,050 yuan, and "Tong Wu" bonds rose from 1,350 yuan to 1,500 yuan. Only "Tong Ding" bonds were the most sluggish. As a result, "Jia Yi Bing" bonds each rose less than 200 yuan compared to before the market closure, while "Ding Wu" bonds rose by 70-80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Forward Foreign Exchange Interest Rate</h3>
<p>Designated Banks Changed to 4.2%</p>
<p>After the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, the Central Bank reduced the interest rate on forward foreign exchange from 5% to 3%. However, the designated banks felt that this regulation was too low and were unwilling to act as agents. After negotiation among the designated banks, the rate was raised to 4.2%. Calculated at 3%, the monthly interest was 100 yuan for 3,350 yuan, making the total 3,450 yuan. Now, calculated at 4.2%, the monthly interest is 140 yuan, making the one-month forward foreign exchange rate 3,490 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu Completes Task: Taiwan Rice to Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, flew to Taiwan on the 22nd of this month on the orders of President Song to negotiate the shipment of Taiwan rice to Shanghai. He has now completed his mission and flew back to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is now learned that Xu has completed his task, and Taiwan rice will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities to provide relief. Xu has designated the "Haiyu" freighter to sail to Taiwan on September 3rd to load the rice. Subsequently, Taiwan white rice will arrive steadily, ensuring that the city's food supply is sufficient and that the people will not suffer from food shortages, and that grain prices can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Pan Xulun Discusses Government Economic Policies</h3>
<p>[Reported from Nanjing on the 27th by our newspaper] Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, when interviewed by reporters on the 27th, denied that we would take measures to prohibit the import of cotton yarn or hardware. However, he said that the government would find ways to adjust the tax rates on certain imported goods, which may be announced within a few days. He also said that the Supreme National Defense Council had discussed raising import taxes. Regarding the exchange rate adjustment, Pan believes that this will encourage the export of domestic goods. In the future, the government will continue to adopt subsidy policies for the export of raw silk and other goods. Regarding the rising price of cotton yarn in Shanghai, he said that after the exchange rate adjustment, Shanghai yarn merchants rushed to order from the Textile Construction Corporation, with orders reaching 40,000 bales in one day, almost equal to the total output of the company for several months. The authorities are paying close attention to suppressing yarn prices and have decided to invite private manufacturers to join the Cotton Textile Management Committee to unify distribution.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Stock Exchange Approved to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 27th: The North China Securities Exchange was ordered to suspend trading in April of this year. It then applied for resumption of operations, citing the example of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. As previously reported, reliable sources now report that the Tianjin Municipal Government has received an order from the Ministry approving the resumption of operations. Preparations are currently underway. The principal is Yang Liushou. It has been observed that since the suspension of trading at the Tianjin Stock Exchange, securities trading has been quite chaotic, and much of the idle capital has turned to hoarding. The resumption of operations of the exchange may bring things back to order.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Conditions and Poor Environment: Large Sell-Off of Chinese and Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a large sell-off due to tight credit conditions. The yarn and cloth industry had to release Chinese stocks in order to cope with the capital needed to open cotton yarn from the Textile Construction Corporation. As a result, a selling frenzy began, and prices gradually declined. At the high opening prices, Yong Yarn was 733 yuan, Meiya was 4,430 yuan, Jingfu was 270 yuan, Xinguang was 288 yuan, and Quanxing was 210 yuan. After the opening, sellers were numerous, and prices fell sharply. Near noon, all showed low prices: Yong Yarn was 655 yuan, Meiya was 3,650 yuan, Xinguang was 238 yuan, Jingfu was 218 yuan, and Quanxing was 155 yuan. Prices recovered slightly near the close. Smaller and mid-sized stocks in various cold sectors were also pressured by the selling wave. The veteran stocks suddenly declined. As a result, Yong Yarn fell by a little less than 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell by 15%, and Quanxing also fell by around 20%. Smaller and mid-sized stocks in colder sectors each fell by 10% to 20%. Veteran stocks also fell by more than 10%.</p>
<p>The environment for foreign stocks was generally poor, and there were also many declines. The opening prices for all stocks were dismal, with supply exceeding demand and difficulties in selling. Low prices were seen near noon. As a result, Yisha, British Union, and Asia each fell by 10% compared to before the market closure, while Huide, Yibei, Paper, and Steel each fell by about 5%. The declines in the industrial sector and Guangye were not as significant.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Corporation Changes Distribution Method; Yarn and Cloth Market Prices Both Decline Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned down. From the morning, there were rumors that the authorities would centralize distribution, causing market sentiment to become uneasy. "Double Horse" yarn once fell to as low as 1.6 million, before recovering to 1.69 million due to buying. The closing price of 20-count mixed-brand yarn also fell by 100,000, 16-count yarn fell by 50-70,000, and 42-count yarn fell by a significant 200,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Corporation listed fair prices as usual. Although purchasers were extremely enthusiastic, the allocation amount was far from sufficient. It is reported that the Textile Construction Corporation, in order to prevent speculation by related industries, will change its method of selling cotton cloth and yarn from the 29th of this month. Cotton yarn and cloth opened on that day must be paid for and picked up the next day, and the qualification for opening loans will be cancelled if delayed. With many closing out positions, the market fell. However, sales on the customer side are still sustainable, as it is gradually entering the peak season. As a result, each cloth fell by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market, which had been rising for several days, turned down slightly yesterday. This was because those who had made profits sold off their positions. At the same time, the Textile Construction Corporation changed its policy regarding the sale of cotton cloth and cotton yarn from the 29th. Yarn and cloth purchased on a given day had to be paid for and picked up the next day, and the qualification for opening loans would be cancelled if delayed. Many closed out positions, and the market fell. However, demand from customers remained sustainable, as the peak sales season was approaching. As a result, each cloth fell by about 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange to Hold Founders' Meeting to Elect First Board of Directors; Internal Organization Divided into Four Departments and One Office</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] After the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the first batch of 234 stock exchange brokers, the stock exchange yesterday sent letters to each approved broker, instructing them to first pay a cash deposit of 20 million yuan. On that day, more than 80 brokers paid in full. The brokers who have paid the deposit will draw lots at the stock exchange at 11:00 AM today to determine the order in which they will conduct transactions and to distribute telephone lines to each broker in the trading floor. The remaining brokers who have not paid are also expected to pay within a few days to avoid delays in the installation of telephone lines.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Stock Exchange will convene a full founders' meeting within one or two days to facilitate the establishment of four departments (finance, administration, investigation, and research) and one secretariat. The appointment of General Manager Wang Zhixin and Assistant Managers Gu Shanchang and Yang Sapu should not be a problem. The clearing house will also be established within a few days, and it is expected that Wang Zhixin will also serve as its manager. The supervisors sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the stock exchange are also expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month.</p>
<p>After the establishment of this stock exchange, there will be an era-defining reform compared to the old Chinese Stock Exchange. In terms of calculation methods, the old Chinese Stock Exchange often required mobilizing 120 people and working for more than 15 hours to complete the day's work. With the new methods, only 10 people are needed, and the entire process can be completed in two hours. In addition, the accounting system for brokers will also adopt a uniform format. Currently, there are two types, Chinese and Western, and they are being drafted by the accounting firms of Xu Yongzuo and Xi Yuqi. Each broker can choose one to use. In the future, the stock exchange will send auditors to each broker at any time to check their business operations.</p>
<p>The construction of the stock exchange building has been completed, and the interior design of each department has entered the final stage. It is expected that the opening can be held as scheduled on September 9th.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrival of New Rice; Mixed Grains Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw arrivals mainly from Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, and Pudong, mainly new rice. Old rice and "Bai Yuan" rice were scarce. Therefore, "Bai Geng" rice remained popular, and "Bai Yuan" rice was still fragrant and dry. New "Geng" rice was less popular, falling slightly by 1,000 yuan. New and old "Xian" rice were of average quality. 29,000 bags of Brazilian American rice continued to be distributed in the north and south markets. Flour mills released very little, and demand exceeded supply. The market outside the mills continued to rise by 300-400 yuan. Wheat from Fujian and Shantou was consumed, with white wheat still preferred in the north. High prices were active, rising by 300-500 yuan, while mid- and low-grade wheat were flat. However, the market softened slightly at noon. Wheat bran was selling well in rural areas, rising by another 200-300 yuan. Supplies of Qingdao oil were gradually becoming scarce, and stores gradually increased prices by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybeans saw an influx of supply, with some inquiries from Shantou and Quanzhou. Old beans were scarce and prices remained firm, while new beans were sluggish and prices were weak, falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Broad beans were stable. Sesame seeds continued to decline in downstream sales, falling by 1,000 yuan. New peanuts from northern Jiangsu have appeared, but transportation is inconvenient. Chaozhou has made some purchases. Prices are rising as the old and new seasons transition, rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Bean cakes are selling slowly, with no movement in other cities, falling by another 200-300 yuan. New corn arrivals continued, with small fluctuations of 500-600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Hankou Money Shops Request Registration but Are Denied</h3>
<p>Our newspaper, Hankou, 28th: Twenty-seven money shops in Hankou applied for business registration but were denied. The Ministry of Finance also ordered the Hankou Municipal Government to supervise and stop their operations to avoid affecting the financial situation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Supervise Loans; Contracts Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Area Food Salt Loan Syndicate of 21.2 billion yuan, many commercial banks and money shops have enthusiastically joined the syndicate. The banks account for 4.765 billion yuan, with Jiangsu Peasant Bank alone underwriting 2.455 billion yuan. All the money shops together contributed 535 million yuan. Together, these amount to 5.3 billion yuan. The remaining 15.9 billion yuan will be undertaken by the Three Banks and Two Bureaus. Yesterday was the day when member banks and money shops signed contracts. The syndicate's work became very busy at once. The loan targets are salt merchants and salt dealers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and factories under supervision. They must first find a guarantor, and three businesses must jointly guarantee each other. After the approval of the Supervision and Government Bureau, they can directly receive loans from the syndicate.</p>
<h3>Northeast Red Army Currency</h3>
<p>Registration Period Will Not Be Extended; Approximately 2.2 Billion Registered</p>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] After the expiration of the Northeast Red Army currency registration period, the authorities decided not to extend it. The registration amount in Shenyang, Changchun, Siping, and Yongji was over 800 million, and the total amount, including the inventory of various agencies, was over 100 million, totaling over 900 million. Shenyang had the most. The other counties and cities will end by the end of this month, but as of the 25th, the total was over 400 million. In summary, the total registered amount of Red Army currency in areas where Northeast government orders are implemented is over 2.2 billion. The detailed figures are being cleared and will be fully paid with circulating currency. As for small-denomination Red Army currency below ten yuan, many merchants still refuse to use it. The Economic Committee has therefore ordered the Northeast branches of the Central Bank to unconditionally redeem it from now on to avoid public panic. The exchange rate between the Northeast industrial and commercial exchange and the circulating currency is under negotiation. The price of circulating currency has been rising daily. According to a report from the inspection agency, the black market has reached 13.5 yuan of legal currency per yuan of circulating currency. The Northeast Branch of the Four Joint Offices now holds a joint meeting every Saturday, attended by the heads of various financial institutions to discuss the exchange situation of the week and formulate countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Between Taiwan Currency and Legal Currency</h3>
<p>Will It Be Set at One to Thirty-Seven?</p>
<p>After the government prevented the plan to set the Taiwan currency at one to forty yuan of legal currency, sources now say that the Taiwan currency will still be allowed to float, possibly changing to one Taiwan dollar to thirty-seven or thirty-eight yuan of legal currency.</p>
<h3>Soviet Gold Production</h3>
<p>Approximately 3.5 Million Ounces per Year</p>
<p>[Reuters, Basel, 27th] The International Bank recently estimated that Soviet gold production is approximately 3,500,000 ounces per year. World gold production in 1945 was approximately 27,000,000 ounces, compared to 28,000,000 ounces in 1944 and 41,000,000 ounces in 1941.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The upward trend of white coal and "Huai" coal prices in the coal market has slowed down. Traders, feeling that prices have risen too sharply in recent days, are no longer buying if they have no actual sales. The Commercial Joint Sales Office of Hongji White Coal Seam and Bituminous Coal is still distributing coal as usual, and the distribution price has not changed. Therefore, the market price has also remained stable. Since white coal blocks and liquid fuel prices rose sharply, sales at various coal shops have gradually become smoother, and the market price has slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Meltons Sell Well</h3>
<p>American "Cang Qing" (dark blue) Melton fabrics have recently been selling very well among woolen fabrics. There is a considerable amount of fabric being released daily from public tea parties and wholesale houses. Ordinary brokers and street vendors are also involved in the trade. Local businesses and customers continue to demand purchases, as the public generally believes that the fabric is cheap and of good quality. Coats, robes, and uniforms for the army, navy, government, railways, and women, men, and children of all ages are suitable. Actual sales are bound to be widespread. Therefore, although supplies continue to arrive, public confidence remains quite stable. If there is no large-scale ordering by outsiders, it would not be surprising if the price of this quality fabric rose to over 30,000 yuan per yard. The highest price has been 27,500 yuan, and the lowest has been 16,000 yuan. Yesterday, the market price was 23-24,000 yuan, with white-edged fabric being more popular than black-edged fabric.</p>
<h3>Sellers Holding Too Firmly on Prices; Old Qimen Tea Sales Have Stalled</h3>
<p>It has been observed that although British export firms in this city have been very interested in purchasing high-grade old Qimen tea, the sellers are currently holding too firm on prices, making it difficult to obtain the tea. Therefore, sales have been temporarily suspended. According to buyers, they will consider making further purchases if suppliers are willing to make concessions. Otherwise, enquiries are being made for old "Chou Zhen" and old "Zhen Mei" teas, with Wu Chang, Dadechang, Hua Tea, and Wang Qiaotai all showing interest. The market is active, and selling prices are high. However, the B.O.P. grade Taiwan fine black tea, which is being watched by Indian firms, is rarely traded due to limited arrivals and inventory. However, Qimen floral and broken black teas are selling more and more smoothly, and there is likely to be further price increases in the future. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, Suxi and other places have not stopped trading, and public confidence remains strong.</p>
<h3>United States Lifts Freeze on Deposits Made Before 1945</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The US Treasury Department announced tonight that it is lifting the freeze on foreign deposits in the United States made before October 5, 1945, with the exception of deposits made by German and Japanese nationals. This action by the Treasury Department is intended to alleviate the financial difficulties of foreign refugees in the United States.</p>
<h3>Price Limits for American Cotton Textiles - Adjustment of Changes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Price Administration Bureau recently announced that starting in September, monthly price limits for cotton textiles will be adjusted based on the average price of cotton within the previous two weeks, rather than the previous practice of adjusting based on the average monthly market price. This decision was made in response to the request of the cotton textile industry, as the price limits set in this way can better meet the actual cost needs.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Counterfeit "Sailboat" Brand Spool Thread Seized</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Xin Fu Firm of this port recently discovered that there were many imitations of the "Sailboat" brand spool thread produced by the firm on the market. They reported this to the police bureau and requested an investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the wife of the main suspect, Wei Dazeng (also known as Pei Zeng), was arrested at No. 73 Kangjia Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, above the Shanghai Socks Factory. Dazeng and the remaining accomplices are on the run. A large number of counterfeit trademark models and substandard yarn spools were also seized. It is said that the interrogation is currently underway at the Police Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Export Still Difficult to Resolve After Exchange Rate Adjustment - Promising Autumn Silkworm Rearing in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>This year, silk factories are facing difficulties in development due to the high cost of purchasing spring cocoons for silk production, while the price of silk abroad is lower than the production cost in our country. Therefore, silk businesses are suffering significant losses from foreign sales and cannot afford to export. Most silk factories are either reducing production or stockpiling already produced silk, unwilling to sell at a loss. After the government adjusted the exchange rate and exempted export taxes, silk industry giants claimed that, according to the new exchange rate, the export price of raw silk is still far from covering the cost, and the difficulty of exporting raw silk cannot be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>Further reports indicate that Zhejiang Province, as a silkworm-producing area, has promising prospects for raw silk exports after the exchange rate adjustment. The autumn season is about to begin, and farmers are already interested in silkworm rearing. Rearing will begin in early September, and cocoons can be harvested after twenty days. The government is providing subsidies for this autumn planting, which will reduce the cost for silkworm farmers. The province currently has 180,000 autumn plantings, mostly distributed from cold storage in Hangzhou and Jiaxing. The distribution area is the western Zhejiang silkworm region, accounting for 80%, and the eastern Zhejiang region, accounting for 20%. It is estimated that each planting will yield 15 catties of cocoons, totaling over 20,000 *dan* of fresh cocoons. With each *dan* valued at 120,000 yuan, the total value is approximately 2.4 billion yuan, which will significantly benefit the rural economy. It is said that autumn silkworm rearing allows farmers to utilize their spare time, and the limited quantity means that the required mulberry leaves are mostly self-supplied, reducing costs. Therefore, the current situation is different from spring silkworm rearing.</p>

<h3>Northwest Exploration Notes</h3>
<p>— Gao Zhongrun</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has brought us many changes and much progress. Problems that were once overlooked are now valued. Places that were once difficult to reach are now being explored. I, who grew up in a coastal region, never imagined that I would have the opportunity to roam the wilderness of the inland Gobi. Although transportation is extremely difficult, the lessons and understanding that the war has given us can overcome all hardships. We strive to improve and reach the point where people conquer nature.</p>
<p>What a vast Northwest! Occupying a quarter of the country's territory, it has turbulent rivers flowing without end, magnificent mountains stretching for thousands of miles, remnants of previous development, and a millennial ancient culture. It possesses an indescribable purity, magnanimity, greatness, and openness, deserving of people's appreciation and praise! In this great embrace, there are also ever-changing mirages, which are originally illusory decorations, but this illusion brings comfort to those who experience it firsthand. In the long and silent wilderness, the wind carries the sound of distant bells. These are the camels bearing heavy loads and traveling far, advancing steadily from the desert. They are enduring and patient, fulfilling their task of serving. The desert hares and Gobi antelopes gallop nimbly and lightly across the vast and boundless desert, appearing increasingly free, providing people with much inspiration. However, when ordinary people step on the remains of those camels and other livestock, they cannot help but pity the lives of these animals and lament their hard work in serving humans.</p>
<p>The scenery of the Northwest, influenced by the natural environment, has many differences from the inland provinces. The lives of the people and social dynamics all exhibit unique characteristics. These unique aspects are truly interesting to contemplate, especially when looking back on past events. Now, taking advantage of leisure time, I recall past events. Although I cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgia, a journey of over 30,000 *li* to the vast Northwest is undoubtedly worth recounting.</p>
<h3>The Leap Forward in Lanzhou</h3>
<p>In the middle of two mountains and a river lies an ancient city - Lanzhou. Although it is not as splendid as Shanghai, the prosperity of the city adds to its vibrant atmosphere!</p>
<p>Mount Fulan, south of the city, stands tall and majestic, appearing like a screen. The lower part of the mountain is also called Five Springs Mountain, said to have five springs named "Sweet Dew, Scooping the Moon, Ju Zi, Meng, Hui". Ancient trees are scattered among the mountains, and Buddhist temples are lined up, making it a scenic area. However, it is no longer a place for ordinary people to visit. A military expert accompanied me on a trip to the mountain, and I was truly honored. We reached the highest pavilion and looked north, where the long and narrow Lanzhou was filled with yellow sand and dust. Sand and dust are common in the Northwest, but it is inevitably a bit difficult to get used to at first.</p>
<p>The Yellow River flows along the north side of Lanzhou City. Because we passed by during the winter season, the rolling torrent was frozen like a white silk band. This scene, which is not often seen in Jiangnan, gave us an opportunity to appreciate it. The Zhenyuan Iron Bridge, which spans the Yellow River, is the only vital passage connecting the north and south. It is similar to the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai, supported by steel frames. However, years of wear and tear have caused it to slowly deteriorate without repair. Across the Yellow River Iron Bridge is White Pagoda Mountain, which has many small temples, but the architecture is much inferior to Five Springs Mountain. Since it was winter, the entire mountain was barren, without a single blade of grass, presenting a scene of yellow desolation that could not evoke people's aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>There are quite a few grocery stores in Lanzhou run by Uyghurs from Xinjiang, and their signs often contain a sense of homesickness. Gaochang, Tarim, and Altay are all place names in Xinjiang Province, but in Lanzhou, they have become the signs of larger Uyghur-run shops, expressing a strong local flavor. It's not just the signs, but also the precious local products, such as Turpan grapes, Hami melon dried fruits, Kuqa almond kernels, and other foreign goods from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Gansu's production is limited by natural conditions, and cotton textiles are not abundant. However, the easy access to wool has made wool textiles relatively developed in Lanzhou. This is the only economic resource in the Northwest, and if it can be utilized on a large scale, it may be able to solve the problem of people's clothing. In Lanzhou, industries, medicine, education, and other fields all seem to be working hard and moving forward. This display of strength has added a lot of new vitality to the ancient city of Lanzhou. "Northwest Stronghold," the city's responsibility cannot be shirked. Lanzhou, what an ancient city! In the past eight years of the War of Resistance, it has already taken on the responsibility of construction!</p>
<h3>The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway</h3>
<p>It was a clear morning in early spring with a strong winter feeling. The east had just revealed a fish-belly white glow, and the earth opened its sleepy eyes. The ancient and majestic Lanzhou was shrouded in morning wind and mist, originally possessing an indescribable tranquility, but it was soon broken by the sound of a wailing whistle. Ah! The Northwest Exploration Team, which had been preparing for a long time and was full of talent, set off from this dawn moment in the long-distance travel vehicles they had prepared in advance, bid farewell to Lanzhou, and began their westward journey.</p>
<p>The Northwest Exploration Team, composed of sixteen people with talents in transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, military medicine, social studies, and geography, boarded a long sedan and embarked on their journey. They formed a year-long relationship with the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, which was originally Zuo Zongtang's route to Xinjiang. Many willows can still be seen along the road, said to have been planted by Zuo Gong during his western expedition. There is a poem: "The general's western expedition has not yet returned, the sons of Hunan fill the Tianshan Mountains, three thousand miles of newly planted willows, lead the spring breeze through the Jade Gate," praising Zuo Gong's achievements. Later generations, to commemorate his achievements, called those willows "Zuo Gong Willows." In the desolate and empty wilderness, the few willows dotted the landscape, providing people with much joy and excitement.</p>
<p>This only avenue connecting the Northwest has attracted people's attention due to the War of Resistance. In fact, 2,000 years ago, it was already a vital lifeline for transportation between China and foreign countries. It once connected Eastern and Western cultures, harmonized the feelings of various ethnic groups, and exchanged many materials... Now its mission is still important. This international avenue should be valued, protected, supported, and developed as an urgent matter.</p>
<p>The Hexi Corridor is a narrow and long terrain, extending from east to west. Due to the natural restrictions of the Qilian Mountains and the Beishan Mountains in the north and south, it cannot expand, forming a narrow shape. It resembles a dumbbell placed horizontally, or a bone with protrusions at both ends and a narrow middle. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway follows the natural environmental trend, extending along it. There are many Han and Tang relics here. Although past events are like smoke, they are still valuable historical materials. The four commanderies of the Western River in the Han and Tang dynasties—Wuwei (Liangzhou), Zhangye (Ganzhou), Jiuquan (Suzhou), and Dunhuang (Guazhou)—were located on both sides of the avenue. The section from Wuwei to Zhangye is mostly natural Gobi, which required less investment in construction projects. From Zhangye to Jiuquan, the road surface is mostly paved with pebbles. Although these materials are everywhere in the Gobi Desert, it was the blood and sweat of people that made it possible to lay them neatly into a road. It is said that when paving the road, large teams of soldiers were mobilized to use their military caps to pick up the larger stones from afar and pave them into a long avenue. This kind of labor service is truly great. Those who walk on this avenue, how can they not be grateful! Once you leave Jiayuguan, the scenery becomes even more desolate, and supplies become even more difficult. The achievement of picking up stones and paving the road with military caps becomes even greater.</p>
<p>The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway does not always pass through flat Gobi Desert. Sometimes it also passes through alluvial fans (fan-shaped areas at the foot of mountains) of the Qilian Mountains. However, when the snow melts and the ice thaws, mountain torrents can destroy the highway. This situation is also common on the highway on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. Therefore, wooden bridges must be supported on a section of the road so that the torrents can pass under the bridges, minimizing damage to the highway. However, the materials for building the bridges are mostly taken from the "Zuo Gong Willows" on both sides of the highway. Cutting off the love left behind by those who planted trees in the past to achieve the great cause of building roads today, although beneficial in one aspect and harmful in another, both have immortal value in terms of achievement.</p>
<h3>Braving Wind and Snow to Reach Yongdeng</h3>
<p>When the exploration team left Lanzhou and headed west, a water pipe of a car burst when they reached He Kou. Fortunately, we had prepared an official letter stating that if there was a problem with the vehicle, we could contact the highway station on the spot for repairs. This was indeed much more convenient. While the car was being repaired, we saw that He Kou was the intersection of the Zhuanglang River and the Yellow River. The name He Kou must have come from this. On the bank of the Yellow River, we saw the ice floes brought down from the upper reaches, floating eastward piece by piece. The waterwheels near the shore had already been frozen by ice and snow and were not moving at all. The fields were yellow and withered, and people closed their doors and warmed themselves with their hands. This was still the feeling of winter in the north, even though it was early spring.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun was lazily setting in the west, and the sky was full of twilight. The wind was howling, the trees were moving, and sand and dust suddenly filled the air, making it difficult to distinguish anything. Some companions waited quietly in the car, while others went into a store to warm themselves. That night, the car reached Yongdeng County, and snow flakes like goose feathers were falling.</p>
<p>The snow in the north is like the rain in Jiangnan. It doesn't say much, but it can fall for three or four days at a time. Our journey was hindered by the snow. With nothing to do for a day, we borrowed more than a dozen horses from the county government to try riding. Because livestock is the main means of transportation in the Northwest, the most convenient and easiest to obtain is the horse. Riding a horse will be a part of life in the Northwest, so we must practice first.</p>
<p>In a small county town, there are not many households, and the market is very deserted. Suddenly, more than a dozen riders on horseback, walking on narrow streets, naturally attract attention. Riding a horse is not an easy task. Those who know how to ride a horse cannot guarantee that they will not make mistakes, let alone those who don't know how to ride. Everyone followed the principle of caution, not trying to run fast, but advancing slowly. Before we had gone too far, a companion who was accustomed to riding a horse impatiently said, "Riding this slowly is like a *zhuangyuan* parading the streets!" Amidst a burst of laughter, another companion who was not good at riding a horse retorted, "You should be fined! In this era of the Republic, where did the *zhuangyuan* come from? Your mind still has some feudal toxins…"</p>
<p>In a happy gathering, time always seems to pass too quickly. The sound of laughter and the sound of horses' hooves echoed into the old Manchu city. It turned out that Yongdeng County has two cities: one is the Han city, also known as the new city, where the shops and agencies are located; the other is the Manchu city, also known as the old city, which was the place where banner people who received salaries from the Qing Dynasty lived. Now the city is desolate and uninhabitable, with only a few Manchu families living in one corner of the city. In those days, they were "royal Qing families", but now they are destitute and have become beggars. When we returned the horses, we could not help but feel the fleeting nature of wealth and glory.</p>
<h3>Climbing over Niaosha Ridge</h3>
<p>— Traveling west from Yongdeng for 69 kilometers, we climbed a majestic and rugged mountain road, which was the first high mountain we had passed since leaving Lanzhou, named Niaosha Ridge. It is approximately 3,000 meters above sea level. It is not very tall, but when we traveled through it, winter was still strong, and we saw that the mountain was covered in snow, so we could not help but think of it as a high place. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway passes through the waist of the mountain. Although driving is not very difficult, the winding and twisting road makes travelers feel troubled.</p>
<p>There is a dilapidated temple on the top of the mountain, said to be the Han Xiangzi Temple, inhabited by several Taoists. Accompanied by them are several soldiers. The soldiers did not come here for no reason. If they did not have a special mission, they would never go to that high and cold mountain just to play around.</p>
<p>The Taoists are truly pitiful. On this high and cold mountain, although there is a lot of land, it is not worth planting. Their lives depend entirely on begging for food, and sometimes they can also receive a little incense money. Strangely, the power of Han Xiangzi is quite great. On the top of that barren mountain, he can actually win the faith of nearby villagers. Even traveling merchants have to burn incense and draw a lot, sincerely asking Han Xiangzi to guide them through their confusion and show them the path to wealth. When we rested in the dilapidated temple with two courtyards and six rooms and casually looked around, we saw a car driver drawing lots. When he saw us, he said generously, "You should also draw a lot. The lots here are very effective."</p>
<p>Traveling west from the Han Xiangzi Temple is downhill. At this time, the car is like a conscious animal, gliding downhill without effort. Before long, we reached Gulang. The county seat is built on a hillside, and the highway runs along the foot of the mountain. The streets and houses here are very simple. It is said that in 1930, Gansu suffered a major earthquake, and Gulang County was unfortunately destroyed by that earthquake. Now there are more cars traveling back and forth. Several restaurants have been added to both sides of the highway in that desolate environment. The Qilian Mountains are like a row of screens, separating Gansu and Qinghai provinces, creating the special geographical location of Gansu Province - narrow and long. From here westward, it is flat for thousands of miles, vast and boundless, reminding people - the four commanderies of the Hexi region in the Han and Tang dynasties began from here.</p>
<h3>Wuwei</h3>
<p>— Ancient Liangzhou</p>
<p>Wuwei - ancient Liangzhou, is one of the four commanderies of the Hexi region during the Han Dynasty, 270 kilometers east of Lanzhou. Since we left Lanzhou and headed directly west, it can be regarded as the first important town in the Gansu Corridor. The total area of the territory is 190 *li* long from east to west and about 140 *li* wide from north to south. According to a survey conducted by the county in 1943, the population was 340,000, which was the highest among the counties in the Hexi region at the time.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Wuwei seems to be showing off its martial prowess and flaunting its power. Before we had even stepped into its territory, hearing this fierce-sounding name, we all imagined what kind of terrifying and frightening face it would have. In fact, propaganda is just propaganda, and the reality is the true reality. When we saw that ancient city wall shrouded in broad daylight, we couldn't help but feel a sense of closeness and pleasure. It is not as scary as its name suggests, but instead appears more beautiful and prosperous. Of course, its beauty cannot compare to West Lake; its prosperity is far inferior to Shanghai. But in Gansu, where the land is barren and the people are poor, it can be considered a first-class place.</p>
<p>The wide and clean roads in the city, accompanied by orderly buildings, show the progress of local municipal administration. Many of the larger shops here are opened in black-lacquered doors. From the door you can see the counters, and if they move aside the lattice windows, they will stand at their posts and ask you what you want to buy. This is how the sales process goes. When we passed through Wuwei, we always felt that these shops with high black doors were very leisurely and comfortable, as if they didn't care whether they did business or not. The reason is that most of them only open for half a day and do business for half a day, and the so-called half a day is only three or two hours. I wondered how relaxed and comfortable they were, feeling like a hard-working ox rushing into that lonely land with sparse population and boundless expanse, how hard it was, and who was it for!</p>
<p>Because we were going north from Wuwei to Minqin County for inspection, we stayed here briefly to prepare. Therefore, we took a short tour of Wuwei both inside and outside the city. In terms of scenic spots, the Pingyuan Garden outside the north city is quite elegant. It is said that the owner, Ma XX, grew the trees and plants from scratch during the construction. Now the trees in the garden are competing for space, becoming more and more green and lush, and the flowers and plants are swaying in the light breeze, seeming to praise their freedom. However, the owner of the garden, because he changed to a new environment, has already left this beautiful place. Only a few pavilions, a few houses, and an old gardener are left. Because there is no pressure to supervise, the garden has become deserted. Although we are wanderers of the world and arrive on foot, we have nothing to do with it. However, touching the scenery makes us feel emotional, and we cannot help but sigh that the building is empty. Thinking about it, people are always seeking enjoyment, but enjoyment also depends on opportunity. Temporary enjoyment can comfort the obsessed soul, but thinking about it quietly, isn't it also fleeting wealth and glory?</p>
<p>Not far from the east gate of the city, there used to be a lake, next to which two temples were built - Dayun Temple and Qingyun Temple. There were two pagodas in the temple, but unfortunately that place rich in Buddhist art was destroyed by an earthquake on April 12, 1927. The pagodas collapsed, the temples were destroyed, and the lake dried up. Along with the collapse of the pagodas and temples, many lives were lost, perhaps they ascended to heaven with the bodhisattvas in the temples at the same time! Strangely enough, a bell tower a few feet away from the collapsed temple was not affected by the earthquake and still stands tall. Especially after the Qian'e Temple and the tall Buddhist pagoda were ravaged, it appears even more majestic and great. The bell tower is five or six *zhang* high, and the architectural style is like a bunker. Going up from the side door is like climbing a city tower. There are two floors on the city tower, with a stele on the bottom and a bell on the upper floor. The patterns on the bell are unique, with heavenly female figures carved on it. If we use the murals seen in the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang to measure the bell, it should be a relic of the Tang Dynasty. However, looking at the dim and blurry inscription below, it seems to record that King Zhang of the Former Liang Dynasty cast it with five kinds of metal. Why did King Zhang want to cast that bell, and why did he use five kinds of metal to cast it? These are all events like smoke, which have long been ethereal and unproven. In short, the age of that bell is quite old, there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>The Confucian Temple in the south of the city is also magnificent and grand, containing many stone steles. A Western Xia script stele, which is relatively famous in the Hexi area, is displayed in this Confucian Temple. However, after many years and after being touched by people over many generations, the inscriptions have become blurred. Wuwei City is not too big, but there are vast plains around the four suburbs. The plains are densely wooded and the agriculture is abundant. It can be called a rich area in the Hexi region. The ancients had the saying "Golden Zhangye, Silver Wuwei." Although the famous Silver Wuwei is not as outstanding as Golden Zhangye, the remaining silver should still be valued by people!</p>
<p>Anti-Slip Wax</p>
<p>After waxing, floors are very slippery. The illustrated engineer James is using a special machine to test the effectiveness of anti-slip waxes.</p>
<h3>Trudging Through Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>To conduct a grounded investigation, we must adopt a "no risk, no reward" spirit to undertake our task. Although local leaders and heads of various units provide valuable reports, on-site interviews are more effective; this is our belief. As the saying goes, "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." You say, what clarity and thoroughness can be achieved with a single sighting? It can help you resolve many doubts and bring indescribable pleasure. However, traveling in the Northwest is not as carefree as one might imagine. Take the road from Wuwei north to Minqin County, for instance. Cars are useless there. They can be as swift as lightning on flat ground, but in such places, they are as helpless as stranded fish, unable to move. Therefore, we hired four three-horse-drawn carts and set off across the vast, open plains swept by wind and snow.</p>
<p>In a place one has never been before, the excitement of curiosity can make one forget the pain, even though all sensations of life are bitter and painful, and instead feel even more exhilarated. On the boundless expanse where wind danced with snow, one might occasionally see a dozen or so camels passing by, accentuating our solitude. Otherwise, it could be said that birds had entered the cold forest and livestock were tethered in their sheds. We sat in open carts, assaulted by fierce winds that made it nearly impossible to open our eyes, and our path was blocked by goose feather-like snowflakes. Fortunately, when we departed from Wuwei, we hired a guide to show us the way through the vast, silver-gray world, a beacon of hope in the confusion.</p>
<p>On the first day, we stayed at the Zong Family Mansion, the first night on the way to Minqin. It was likely on that day that we crossed two large beaches: the Lu Family Beach and the South Beach. As the carts traversed the beaches, the wheels rubbed against the yellow sand, making a rustling sound. The horses' hooves sank into the sand; the harder they pulled, the deeper they sank, sometimes almost unable to free themselves. At times, the driver applied too much pressure, whipping the horses too harshly, causing their legs to give way, and they would suddenly kneel on their front legs or lose their footing on their hind legs. With great difficulty, we crossed the soft sand and reached more solid yellow soil. By this time, the horses pulling the carts were soaked in sweat. Despite the bitter cold, the horses' breath appeared hot. However, this heat quickly turned into ice in the horses' manes. As for us, sitting in the carts and not moving much, we felt the unforgiving chill of the frontier region. Even though we were all wearing old sheepskin coats, we still huddled together for warmth.</p>
<p>The Gobi Desert was truly desolate, with only a few scattered villages and sparse old trees. What met the eye was always an atmosphere of late autumn desolation. In fact, it was the season of late spring, yet it remained so bitterly cold. One could imagine that in the Jiangnan region, it was already the season for flowers to bloom in competition. Fashionable ladies might have changed into light single-layered garments, while we were still wrapped in our stinky old sheepskin coats, living a deep winter life. But strangely enough, as I and another companion were talking like this in the cart, less than ten paces from the Zong Family Mansion, behind a small straw shed, lay a naked person. It was first noticed by a companion in the front cart because we were in the second cart. In the blink of an eye, as our cart approached, we saw that it was a girl of about fourteen or fifteen years old. She bent over, propped herself up on her head, and reached out to beg from us. Her expression seemed to show shame, but driven by the need to survive, it was no wonder she had resorted to this. From this, we realized that the people in the Hexi region were indeed desperately poor, otherwise, why would a girl be naked to resist the cold and beg? A sense of compassion is innate in everyone. To show our sympathy and pity for her poverty, we collected some money for her. But upon careful reflection, how could that small amount of money solve her poverty problem, and such poverty was certainly not limited to her alone. As we were talking like this in the cart, we suddenly heard someone reciting loudly, "Behind vermillion gates, meat and wine abound, while on the road, lie corpses frozen to the ground." Our conversation was interrupted, and we paid attention to the source of the voice. It turned out to be an elderly companion in the last cart, shouting at nature in such a way.</p>

<h3>Answering Questions from Readers: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) Mortgage Loan</p>
<p>Question from Hong Dongling: I have a house left by my late father. In 1936, because a relative was short of funds for business, he borrowed from my mother. Since there was no cash available, my mother mortgaged the house to someone named Jia, receiving 700 yuan in legal tender for a term of three years. Upon expiration, Jia could freely dispose of it, and from that day on, Jia would collect rent to offset the interest. My mother and wife signed the agreement, and my father-in-law was the guarantor. Now I have the following questions and hope to receive answers:</p>
<p>(1) The mortgage loan agreement was not signed by me, and my mother and wife have since passed away. Does the agreement continue to be valid? (2) To comply with my late mother's will (oral), I have repeatedly negotiated with Jia, willing to repay 200 times the original amount. However, Jia believes there is an opportunity to exploit and insists on 500 times the amount. I believe the mortgage procedure is not legal and intend to deny it. I plan to submit a document to the land administration authorities stating that the contract is lost and request a replacement, and also publish a notice to search for it, setting a deadline for it to be invalidated. I am willing to donate the money to a charitable organization. Is this feasible? (3) If the mortgage loan agreement is considered legal, what is the procedure for redemption?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) A mother who mortgages real estate inherited by her adult son from his father, or real estate jointly inherited by her and her son from his father, without the son's consent, the adult son can deny the mortgage right. However, the debt incurred by the mother should be the responsibility of the mother's estate after her death. (2) There are no other statutory standards for how to increase payment when repaying pre-war loans, except for fair adjudication by the court. To avoid the complexity of litigation, it seems best to settle amicably. Regarding the recovery of the contract, if a settlement cannot be reached, you can file a lawsuit to deny the mortgage right and handle it together. If you falsely claim it is lost, it is not in accordance with the facts. Whether to donate to charity or not is not related to the recovery of the contract. (3) Refer to the answers in (1) and (2) for clarification.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing an Heir</p>
<p>Question from Wang Liren: I have several questions and would like your guidance: (1) My father passed away in 1929, leaving two sons and one daughter. The second daughter and youngest son were born to the stepmother. In 1933, the estate was divided into four parts according to law, with the stepmother and daughter each receiving one part. The youngest son suddenly passed away in 1939, unmarried and without children. Who inherits the youngest son's estate? (2) The stepmother is over seventy years old, and the daughter is not yet married. Now the eldest son and his wife are also approaching sixty, with only one daughter. The relatives are discussing establishing an heir, and also want to establish an heir for the deceased youngest son. Can Zhu know if this can be opposed? (3) Who inherits the stepmother's estate after her death? (4) Does the eldest son have the right to inherit the stepmother's estate?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) If a son born to the stepmother dies unmarried after the father's death, his estate is inherited by his biological mother. (2) The system of establishing an heir when there is no son was abolished on May 5, 1931, with the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code. (3) If the stepmother dies in the future, her estate is inherited by her biological daughter. (4) A son who is not her biological child has no right to inherit.</p>
<p>(3) Dissolving an Engagement</p>
<p>Question from Jin Dongshen: When I was eighteen years old, my parents arranged an engagement with a Miss Ma from the same hometown. Although I firmly opposed it, my parents insisted on their own way. Now I am twenty-one years old, and the wedding date is approaching. (1) Is an engagement without my consent valid? (2) I don't know the other party at all, and I don't know their personality. Can I file a request to dissolve the engagement? (3) I am twenty-one years old. Do I have the right to make my own decisions about marriage? (4) I have no contact with the other party. Can the other party demand compensation when the engagement is dissolved? (5) If I am unwilling to marry and am absent on the wedding date, is it a crime?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Qin Liankui] (1) If parents arrange an engagement for their minor children, and the children do not express their consent after reaching adulthood, they are not bound by the engagement not arranged by themselves. (2) If the engagement was not arranged by oneself, and there is no act of ratification, it cannot be considered legally established, so there is no question of dissolving the engagement. In order to eliminate successive entanglements, a statement of non-binding can be made. (3) The Civil Code considers the age of twenty as adulthood. Those who have reached adulthood do not need to obtain parental consent for engagement and marriage. (4) Compensation is based on damage. If there is damage, the person causing the damage is responsible. The fact that there is no contact can be used as proof that the individual did not consent, and has nothing to do with the factual responsibility of the acting party. (5) Absence on the wedding date due to unwillingness to marry is by no means a criminal act.</p>

<p>A Strange Phenomenon Amidst the Urban Housing Shortage! Landlords Force Evictions, Leading to Homelessness. We Hope That All Sectors of Society Will Show the Greatest Sympathy.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: We are tenants who are about to be forced to live on the streets. In the midst of the authorities' efforts to alleviate the housing shortage, a strange drama is unfolding where landlords extort old tenants for small rents and use their power to forcibly evict tenants. It is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>We are five tenant households living in a large courtyard at No. 1 Houjia Lane, Xifahua Town. For the past seven or eight years, we have been on relatively good terms with the landlord, Mr. Huang. Three years ago, because the landlord could not establish himself in Shanghai, we tenants voluntarily planned and raised funds on his behalf, either by prepaying rent for two years or one year, to help him go to work in the rear area with this large sum of money. After the victory, the landlord also returned to Shanghai after demobilization. We tenants were secretly rejoicing, preparing to welcome the old landlord back in glory. However, Mr. Huang suddenly changed his old ways, instructing all tenants to vacate the premises so that he could lease them to new tenants and obtain huge transfer fees and small rents. Those who wished to continue renting would have to renegotiate the rent like new tenants. Fearing his power, the tenants swallowed their anger and repeatedly negotiated with him, and as a result, they agreed to pay a total of 600,000 yuan in rent and 1.5 dou of rice per household per month for a period of two years, with various harsh conditions attached. Fearing accidents as a safeguard, the tenants requested him to issue rent receipts, which resulted in a deadlock. Unexpectedly, on August 11, Huang led many soldier-like people to evict the tenants, threatening to demolish the houses. With great force, they entered the houses and arbitrarily demolished door panels, windows, lofts, and walls, and threw the tenants' furniture outside, sealing and nailing the doors. The unreasonableness of their actions can be imagined. At that time, all the able-bodied men of each household were out on business, leaving only women and children, who were frightened and cried upon seeing this. The situation was truly unbearable. Finally, after kneeling and begging bitterly, Huang reluctantly left with his group. Before leaving, he reiterated the tenants vacate the premises, otherwise he would come back to demolish the houses. At this point, the tenants felt that they had no way to appeal and no way to seek help. When the time comes, they will have no choice but to be forced to live on the streets and become refugees.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, the deadline is approaching, and how are we, these helpless common people, going to deal with this landlord? Therefore, we would like to use a corner of your valuable publication to make an urgent appeal to all sectors of society, asking for justice and assistance, and asking for guidance on how to handle this painful situation! (Respectfully submitted by all tenants of No. 1 Houjia Lane, Xifahua Town)</p>
<h3>Journey to Northern Jiangsu: Yangzhou, A Center for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Comparable to London, which served as the center for exiled governments of small European countries during World War II, Yangzhou hosts a considerable number of Northern Jiangsu refugee county magistrates. At its peak, there were twelve, and currently, there are still six: Gaoyou, Shiying, Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, and Lianshui. In addition to the exiled county governments, there are also exiled county party headquarters and county youth leagues.</p>
<p>These exiled county magistrates are working diligently, preparing for their return home. Most of them are "locals" from Northern Jiangsu, familiar with the area. But what use is familiarity alone? All they have is a group of scattered refugees receiving relief, and a ravaged, seemingly unattainable land. As such, they possess almost nothing.</p>
<p>But they still have an exiled county government after all. The Jiangsu Provincial Government stipulates that the organization of an exiled county government consists of thirteen people, with a monthly budget of one million yuan (including staff salaries), a one-time allocation of fifteen million yuan for reconstruction, and one hundred rifles, hoping that they will cooperate with the military to fight back!</p>
<p>Exiled County Magistrates Can Only Smile Bitterly</p>
<p>Fifteen million yuan sounds like a rather impressive number. But nowadays, officials in Shanghai wouldn't even glance at it. Northern Jiangsu, which has been "struggled" by the Communist Party, is no different from a vacuum. Those so-called "liberated areas," once recovered, will require countless efforts to rebuild, and it is hard to know where to begin!</p>
<p>Nothing is more urgent than public security. If they were to use all fifteen million yuan solely for this purpose, it would still not be enough to equip a decent self-defense force. Military operations are underway in Northern Jiangsu. The military's task is to resist or defeat the enemy. Public security must be the responsibility of local authorities. "Can you take on this responsibility?" The exiled county magistrates can only smile bitterly. Not to mention the future, even in free Yangzhou, public security still needs to be maintained by the military.</p>
<p>Hugging Thighs and Begging Them to Go Slowly</p>
<p>A few days ago, the troops stationed at Dayi Market on Yangtian Road were reassigned to other tasks, and the defense was ordered to be taken over by the self-defense force. The self-defense force—a group of people who have not received proper training—were hesitant because they knew that remnants of the Communist forces were lurking near the area. The deadline for the troop transfer arrived, but the self-defense force had not yet arrived when the original troops left. Tens of thousands of local people immediately felt unprotected, broke down in tears, hugged the soldiers' legs, and begged them to leave slowly: "If the New Fourth Army comes, we will suffer!" Step by step, the soldiers took ten hours to travel twenty li.</p>
<p>Before the self-defense force arrived, the Communist forces arrived first. The pitiful Dayi Market suffered another massacre, especially those who had warmly welcomed the National Army. Later, the National Army sent another platoon to drive out the Communist forces.</p>
<p>Due to the Communist forces' "signature move"... guerrilla warfare, and the ubiquitous local teams and militias harassing everywhere, this issue deserves special attention. If the local armed forces cannot be established quickly and soundly, and if organization cannot be used to counter organization, the strength of the National Army will inevitably be dispersed and cannot be fully utilized.</p>
<p>Old Ox and Broken Cart: Military and Political Disconnect</p>
<p>The problem is not just this one; there are too many problems. The military requires close cooperation from the political side, operating as smoothly as a machine, but the political side is like an old ox pulling a broken cart. The military's simplest demands are for laborers, materials, intelligence, and assistance in resolving all difficulties, and they expect things to be done quickly. These requests are not excessive, but they already cause headaches for the local authorities, not to mention that the main work of politics is not limited to this.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is a special area. The Communist Party uses it as a testing ground for their political theories. Therefore, the political struggle is even more acute. Organizing and training the people and winning over the people are the two most important tasks. The people of Northern Jiangsu hate the Communist Party intensely. Grasping this sentiment of the people and using it effectively would be enough to prevent the Communist Party from gaining a foothold. But all of this seems to be undone, or done very little, and done poorly.</p>
<p>--Are those who have fled to be left to fend for themselves? Are those who have not fled to be left to groan under the tyrannical power of the Communist forces?</p>
<p>The Communist Party, having lost the hearts of the people, is actively engaged in political "struggle" using all means of threats and inducements.</p>
<p>Full of Learning, How to Implement?</p>
<p>"Politics cannot keep up with the military" is an old saying that has become outdated, but it still applies completely, showing the heaviness of the diseased state. A county-level administrative official's direct relationship with the people is far more important than simply issuing policy statements. However, the salary of today's county-level administrative officials is several times worse than that of the already meager provincial-level civil servants. A county magistrate's new salary is 120,000 yuan. The rest can be imagined. Without money, it is like a machine without oil; what effect can it have?</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, those who want to do things are full of learning, but how can they implement it? According to regulations, out of the fifteen million yuan reconstruction funds, only five million yuan can be used before returning to the county, leaving ten million yuan to be used after returning. Not enough—of course not enough—and the instructions from above are to find solutions on the spot. But squeezing oil from an oil-depleted seed is likely a dangerous thing. Military operations are underway, and the exiled people are happy that their return home is scheduled, but the exiled county magistrates are heavy-hearted. "Politics cannot keep up with the military" has been said a thousand times. Are we going to let the impatient armed brothers stomp their feet?</p>
<h3>The Philippines in the Rainy Season: Manila, July 28 (Airmail)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Xing Guangzu</p>
<p>After touring the entire city of Manila, you will see many magnificent buildings, bustling urban areas, shopping centers filled with fashionable ladies, and glittering nightclubs. These many 20th-century modern embellishments have transformed the capital of Manila into a splendid city, praised as the "Pearl of the Orient." However, no one can deny that hidden beneath this embossed glory are darkness, poverty, depravity, vulgarity, chaos, and the seven deadly sins, which seem eternally difficult to wash away. Upon closer observation, you can see that the economy of the entire island nation is nothing more than a gaunt and skeletal framework.</p>
<p>This young republic seems too young. It is shrouded in a layer of darkness in politics, economics, and many other aspects, and needs someone like Prometheus who can bring some light and warmth. I believe, as do many others, that it can only rely on the United States—the grantor of its independence.</p>
<p>Everything in the Philippines during the rainy season gives people a strange feeling, like a dream, like depression.</p>
<p>For several days, it has been raining incessantly. The entire city street is flooded with rainwater, and the rain continues to fall. The rain in this island nation is different from what we have in our country. The drizzle of spring can embellish the beauty of the Jiangnan scenery, but it is certainly not like the rain in this island nation. The rain here has a kind of brute force. It comes suddenly. It never drifts gently in a few drops, nor is it just a torrential downpour. Instead, it pours straight down like the sea overturning. That kind of unforgiving appearance is frightening. You feel the ferocity of the primitive forces of nature. You suspect whether the demons of heaven are wreaking havoc. The strings of large raindrops, the long, straight legs of the rain, hit the exposed, rusty tin roofs wildly. You hide in the spacious house. You can't talk because the soft sound of human voice is completely drowned out by the raging sound of rain. At this time, you want to shout, because only shouting can make you feel your own existence. Sometimes you feel helpless. Your whole body seems to be useless and without strength…</p>
<p>This time I leaned against the window railing, looking at the glittering Manila cityscape through the glass curtain of rain, and I was truly worried.</p>

<h3>A Few Suggestions Regarding Textbook Publishing</h3>
<p>— Critical Words</p>
<p>The summer vacation is over, and schools are about to start. In addition to being busy applying to schools, urging their parents to quickly arrange tuition fees, or handling loan applications themselves, students face another challenge: buying textbooks. Some educators advocate abolishing textbooks altogether, but we believe this is an extreme view. Textbooks are also one of the tools of education. However, regarding the current textbooks, we believe there are a few principles that should be proposed and discussed with the publishing industry in advance.</p>
<p>First, we feel that the quality of the paper used for current textbooks, especially elementary school textbooks, is too poor. This was excusable during wartime because we had to conserve resources. However, in this era of prioritizing education and construction, we can no longer sacrifice children's eyesight and aesthetic appreciation by scrimping on paper. Moreover, it is not necessarily cost-effective economically, because a child may use a textbook for less than a month before it is already tattered. Soon they will need to buy a second one.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of distribution, we hope it will be as widespread as possible. Last semester, schools had to pre-order textbooks, as if they were rationed. We hear that this situation may occur again this year. Last semester, when buying textbooks, we discovered a black market. In some bookstores, you could not buy a book unless you paid a considerable premium. We hope that this phenomenon will not occur this semester. The solution is to increase the number of copies printed and allow all bookstores to sell them.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of price, we must not raise prices. In previous years, we have seen a phenomenon where, before the start of the school year, bookstores suddenly hoarded many of the more popular and commonly used books in schools. After a week or two, these books would reappear, but the price would have increased by several hundred percent. Now, a significant amount of foreign paper is being imported, and the original price is also reasonable. We hope that bookstore owners will not use the excuse of extended foreign exchange rates to inflate book prices.</p>
<p>Textbooks are one of the main tools for popularizing education. This is a major task in spiritual construction. Therefore, we hope that the gentlemen in the publishing industry can plan a more appropriate solution for this matter. This will not only benefit students but also contribute to the country and society.</p>
<h3>The Cliff</h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The value of a work can certainly be determined by the extent to which it influences and guides life. However, to faithfully critique a work, the focus of the critique must change according to the differences in its subject matter; because different contents will inevitably have different influences and guidance on life.</p>
<p>*The Iron Flood*, *Chapayev*, or *The Jungle*, are considered satisfactory works by most people. This is because the former fully explains the power of the masses and the need for group life, and paves a path with hope and struggle; the latter profoundly describes the suffering of life, revealing the layer of fantasy about happiness that covers the real lives of people. In their different subjects, they (*The Iron Flood*, *Chapayev*, and *The Jungle*) all exerted the power to influence life and reaped the effect of guiding life; therefore, they all have the true value of being critiqued. And if we further demand to judge their relative merits, I say this is a foolish idea; the reason is very simple: a majestic choral piece and a sorrowful solo piece cannot be compared at all, because although both are music and have many of the same qualities, the different forms and different emotions of the two are enough to completely negate the accuracy of the comparison.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of the interpretation of temperament, and in terms of the inspiration of passion and reason, I dare not believe that *The Precipice* is a successful work.</p>
<p>The translator of the Chinese version, Li Lin, tells us that the author Goncharov was a Russian writer who, in the history of Russian literature, was only later than Turgenev and Tolstoy. Besides *The Precipice*, he only wrote two novels: *An Ordinary Story* and *Oblomov*. *Oblomov* gained a great reputation. Kropotkin said in *Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature* that it, along with Turgenev's *Fathers and Sons*, Tolstoy's *War and Peace*, and *Resurrection*, were the most successful works of the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Similarly, in *The Precipice*, the author also revealed a delicate style of writing, and more importantly, the author used his best efforts to depict the original form of "passion", and also used his best efforts to describe the situation where reason was buried deep in the "precipice".</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>This was the era of Imperial Russia, when a few people possessed wealth, servants, and land. Raisky: the sole heir of a noble family; he had no brothers or sisters, and even his parents had died long ago. Therefore, his great-aunt raised him and managed all the property he was supposed to inherit. Raisky spent his childhood here. He did not often stay with his great-aunt or cousins, but preferred to walk alone along the Volga River or in the spring countryside; this kind of life created a calm and solitary personality. Gradually, he developed a love for art and literature. Afterwards, he went to Moscow and lived a decadent life for more than ten years, finally returning to his home by the Volga River in the summer of the year he graduated from university. Now his two cousins have grown up and become very beautiful. So he settled down, and in his daily social life he met some of the nearby nobles, and also met Mark – a political prisoner who had been exiled for the second time by the government.</p>
<p>What a dangerous monster Mark was. However, one day when he was secretly eating apples in Raisky's garden, he was seen by Raisky's eldest cousin, Vera. After a few questions and answers, they were both impressed by each other's bold ideas and extensive knowledge. Afterwards, they associated and discussed secretly. But Raisky didn't know any of this, and no one else did either. In Raisky's eyes, Vera was the pearl of this area, possessing unparalleled beauty and wisdom; she was an ember, full of darkness and shining mystery, and even more like the night, full of charm. This charm attracted Raisky, making him unable to leave her side. Vera felt the pain of being spied on and felt extremely unfree. She began to be annoyed with her cousin and made clear hints – which made Raisky taste the frustration of falling in love. He was very eager to find out what secrets Vera was keeping in her heart; he discovered that Vera was receiving and reading blue letters sealed with sealing wax, and he discovered that Vera was coming and going unpredictably and was mentally distracted. Therefore, his suspicion and unease gradually deepened; he once clearly asked his great-aunt what Vera's true nature was? He was also anxiously trying to learn the reason for Vera's change in attitude "She has been very pensive for some time now, have you noticed? Could she be in love"? However, this distraction was futile, and Vera became even more pensive and profound.</p>
<p>At the end of this territory, there was a cliff that descended to the Volga River. The cliff was covered with wild grass and bushes, and a small path stretched from the middle of the trees to the bottom of the cliff. There was an old pavilion there and the tomb of a person who committed suicide for love. There was also a terrible legend, so people would not go there without reason. Mark and Vera chose this place as a meeting place; they used gunshots as a signal.</p>
<p>Vera had read the works of Voltaire and Proudhon, and had a rebellious view of the entire world; her heart was filled with various different explanations – for society, property, and even life. Therefore, she believed in Mark, because in the darkness, Mark was the first to light a lamp for her, indicating a new path.</p>
<p>For many days, Mark had not used gunshots to summon Vera. They had been very interested in getting together, but now they were separated again because of being too faithful to their ideals. For Vera, this was tantamount to the loss of life; she was very depressed and gradually accepted Raisky's comfort and respected Raisky's sympathy. Involuntarily, she told him about the grievances in her heart and confessed her actions in front of Raisky. In this way, Vera relied on Raisky's comfort and religious devotion to spend the painful days in the early stage of suddenly breaking up with Mark, thinking that she would slowly be able to free herself from her contradictory state of mind and return to a peaceful life. However, on the evening of the seventh day, a gunshot suddenly came from the cliff. A wound that was about to heal was deeply stabbed again: freedom, love, happiness, strength, Vera remembered everything. However, she immediately hesitated: if she went, Mark was a most stubborn man, what would there be besides arguing and breaking up? If she didn't go, Vera really didn't have this strength, she understood that she was a lamb in a sea of suffering, needing both water and milk. In her heart, passion and reason began to clearly oppose and fight each other. Finally, she ran to the cliff regardless of everything, while Raisky stretched out his obstructing hand at the end of the road like a statue, and the second gunshot was heard again. Raisky felt that he was rescuing a woman who was about to be swallowed by passion. He warned Vera with the voice of reason that the cliff was not a place to stay: "This road is too steep, you will fall again." He rebuked Vera with the voice of reason to go back. However, nothing worked, and after the third gunshot, Raisky had to allow Vera to walk down the cliff step by step.</p>
<p>Raisky saw all of this. He suddenly hated anyone other than himself in his heart, and he began to have extreme contempt and hatred for Vera. But after a short time, he became sympathetic to Vera again. Because driven by passion, human nature is inherently unstable; moreover, Vera was already trapped in severe self-condemnation and pain! Raisky confessed everything about his guilt to Vera very shamefully and advised Vera to let her grandmother know about these things. This was a very touching scene of mutual trust and mutual understanding. Vera blamed herself and did not blame anyone else, becoming very quiet. She also told a very close friend, Dus, about the facts, saying with a tone of repentance: "Your pure Vera has been buried deep in that cliff." She no longer kept secrets in her heart, thus gaining full sympathy to resist the pain left by the passion in her heart.</p>
<p>Mark wrote to Vera again, proposing to live together from now on, but Vera had already burned her fingers and dared not hold this flame a second time – although the flame still looked beautiful.</p>
<p>Autumn came, and like waking up from a big dream, Raisky began to think about his wandering life again, crossing the Alps. From afar, he missed his life by the Volga River; he missed his great-aunt Tatyana, and he also missed the poor Vera who was destroyed by passion.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Here, the entire story is centered on Vera, and from every smiling face and every contemplation of Vera, the author has arranged the supreme contradiction and struggle between passion and reason. The background of the story has not changed: a corner of Russia's tranquil land. The Volga River flows quietly, sparkling with white waves, flowing through green fields and groves on both banks; here is Raisky's territory, a beautiful garden, but outside this area, the author has pre-arranged a man-eating cliff.</p>
<p>Vera is not accustomed to the luxury of life, she has spiritual wisdom; this spiritual wisdom drives her to pursue an impossible ideal life, and hopeless pursuit finally creates her gloomy and distressed fate. She has a strong desire for knowledge, so she collects many new knowledge; this knowledge contributes to her dissatisfaction with real life, and real life still restricts her: Vera's distress is formed in this way. Now we understand that it should be very natural for Vera to know and love Mark. However, Vera is like a thirsty lamb, she only knows that Mark has water in his hand, but does not consider whether this water can be used as a drink. When she uses her wisdom and experience to determine the quality of the water, oh my God – passion has already tied her and Mark together! Raisky discovered these things, but Raisky was too ordinary to pull back this passion-bewildered cousin. "I warned you, Vera. I said passion is a fierce wolf." But what's the use? Vera's voice is a patient's plea: "Help me to live. Give me that beautiful passion that shines with glory and illuminates the whole of life." And: "It's too late for me to stop going to the cliff now"!</p>
<p>Passion, yes – is a fierce wolf! Vera escaped its fierce bite, who can escape its fierce bite? Every time I finish reading *The Precipice*, I think so. Opening up my diary from the past three years, I clearly remember the suffering that passion has left me; "*Interrupted Strings*", "*Pagoda*", "*Spring Breeze is Easy*", and "*Requiem*"; let's not talk about it! I now contain a heart full of shame and sorrow, every time I reread my old works. Passion drove me to walk on an uneven mountain road, falling and getting up again, and now I find that at the age of twenty, I already have the gloomy and sorrowful state of mind of an eighty-year-old man.</p>
<p>I admit that I am in the various contradictions and conflicts of adolescence, and passion has a great dominance over me. I once blindly hated and loved everything, and I also suddenly cried when I was laughing. *The Precipice*, after all, told me – a tragic story – with a mother's loving contempt. It clearly painted a fierce wolf in front of me, and in the wolf's mouth, it snatched a bitten heart with blood: I recognized that this was Vera's, and it was also mine! But Vera was sacrificed because Raisky did not thoroughly save her; I am happy because *The Precipice* has powerfully indicated the destination of my passion.</p>
<p>*The Precipice*, is it not a beacon in the night for a young person with weak rational judgment?</p>
<h3>After Reading "Education and Life"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Author: Yu Jiaju, Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>In the preface to his book, Mr. Yu very sincerely told us that he was once a student of Dr. Dewey. Therefore, although the backbone of the whole book cites many Confucian classics and terms, it still expresses the "Natural Empiricism" color system. It seems that the above two sentences are the most pertinent. Even when discussing "development", it is completely based on Dr. Dewey's explanation; Dr. Dewey divides the development of personality into three stages: (1) biological (instinctive), (2) social (customary), and (3) rational (critical); and Mr. Yu also divides it into three stages: (1) material self, (2) social self, and (3) spiritual self. (See Dr. Dewey's writings (1) “Ethics”. (2) “How we Think”)</p>
<p>As for discussing the possibility of education, it is also similar to Dr. Dewey's opinion. Dr. Dewey explains the possibility of education as "Immaturity"; at the same time, this immaturity has two meanings: (1) dependence, and (2) plasticity. (See Dr. Dewey's Democracy and Education) Mr. Yu then combines "immaturity" and "dependence" into one concept, calling it "upwardness". In fact, because it is immature and needs to rely on, it can move upward. Therefore, this is just a difference in terminology.</p>
<p>However, in addition to expounding the natural empirical educational thought system, Mr. Yu also particularly emphasized the aspect of "will" and "belief". This kind of thought happens to coincide with Nietzsche's philosophical thought. Because Nietzsche inherited Kant's theory on the one hand, and deeply understood the mysteries of idealism. On the other hand, he was truly a disciple of Darwin, vigorously advocating "superman"ism; advocating the survival of the fittest and natural selection, at the same time, Mr. Yu in many parts of this book, explained the importance of faith, even more than knowledge. The environment in which human beings live is complex and constantly changing; if we use limited knowledge to deal with this unlimited environment, we will often feel that it is not enough. Therefore, we can only rely on faith and will. Of course, in this way, we should emphasize the importance of motivation and action.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu also advocates extreme respect for the law; this is also consistent with Hegel's thought. At the same time, he believes that those who can be called "perfect" or "superman" are probably only the "nation". Therefore, he once said in this book: "The nation is the highest judge, guide, and developer of national culture".</p>
<h3>Several History Books on World War II</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Regarding the history of World War II, there are probably only a few books available now. Among those published domestically, there is *The History of World War II* by Chu Yukun, published by Shanghai Yongxiang Book Company in April of this year. The author said in the preface: "I started collecting materials from the day the European War broke out on September 1, 1939, and it took eight years to write this book." He also said: "Most of the books on international issues are translations. I am determined to set a precedent for our writing community." But he also frankly pointed out two shortcomings: (1) "After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was almost impossible to obtain real news, so I decided to focus the content of this book on Europe, and omit the Far East and the Pacific. I plan to write a separate book on this topic." (2) The ending of the war is not as detailed as the outbreak of the war, because the enemy took away all the materials I had collected, and I had to finish the second half of the book hastily.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into twelve chapters and three hundred and seven pages, with the full text of the United Nations Charter as an appendix.</p>
<p>The second one is *World War II: A Concise History* by Roger W. Shugg Ph. D. and Major H. A. DeWeerd, published in Washington, The Infantry Journal, 1946. This is a brief military history. In terms of records, the authors said that they strived for accuracy. From this book, we can find out when and where many battles took place and how they unfolded. At the same time, the authors also stated that they did not bury the contributions of the Allied countries to this war, although the United States occupied a very important position.</p>
<p>This book was originally compiled for American soldiers, but the writing is not "specialized" and can be used for public reading and reference. The whole book has five hundred and thirty-eight pages, with forty-four maps attached, which is very convenient for checking.</p>
<p>The next one is *The Secret History of the War* by Waverley Root, published last year in New York, Charles Sribner's Sons, New York, 1945. The whole book consists of two volumes. There is another volume, entitled *Casablanca to Katyn: the Secret History of the War*, which is considered the third volume, but its nature is independent.</p>
<p>The author's attitude is fair, and his ability is strong. He seeks many undiscovered factors and facts behind the scenes of the war. The scope of this book is not limited to one battlefield, one battle, one or several warring countries. There are many political actions, propaganda efforts, diplomatic compromises, and tactical errors, which are written in their original form, which simply makes people feel a little unhappy, and even dare not believe it.</p>
<p>The author is a journalist and has worked in various places since 1927. The materials in the book are mostly collected in Europe. It is said that the inside story tries to avoid emotional effects and seeks to be faithful.</p>
<p>The next one is *History of World War II*, edited by Francis Trevelyan Miller litt. D., LL. D. When writing this book, there was also a specialized historical and military editorial department, the Board of Historical and Military Authorities, whose members were Dr. Curt L. Heymann, a specialist in studying the history of Axis attacks on the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Greece, and the Balkan Peninsula, Benedict Fitzpartrick, a specialist in studying Britain, Karl Burger, a specialist in studying Central European issues, Charles Lam Markmann, a specialist in studying the Allied counterattacks in France, North Africa, Italy, and Germany, Victor H. Lawn, a specialist in studying the battles in the Far East, China, India, and the Philippines, Crerar Harris, a specialist in studying Soviet politics and military affairs, Werner Loeb, a specialist in studying German Nazis and youth movements. The whole book has nine hundred and sixty-six pages, with various photos, maps, important documents, etc. The editor said in the preface that he hopes this book can become a "standard" work.</p>
<p>The editor pointed out that this war resulted in the death and injury of 20 million people, the displacement of 30 million people, and the massacre of 10 million people. The cost of financial resources is estimated at about 1,000,000,000,000 US dollars. Therefore, we have to analyze its causes and describe its results so that the same tragedy will not happen again in the future.</p>
<h3>The Hermit's Beard</h3>
<p>— Zhu Li</p>
<p>Written by He Yi, Published by Shaonian Publishing House</p>
<p>He Yi is an excellent children's literature writer. His works possess the qualities of dissecting reality and expressing human nature, as well as rich interest and descriptions in a child's tone. He provides children with fulfilling appreciation and sound education. Today, when generally precocious erotic stories and tales of gods and monsters are anesthetizing and stimulating immature minds, how eagerly we await some beneficial children's books! He Yi's published works include the following:</p>
<h3>True Stories (short story collection)</h3>
<h3>Arch of Triumph (novel)</h3>
<h3>The Hermit's Beard (short story collection)</h3>
<h3>Wooden Man (novel)</h3>
<h3>Wild Imp (novel)</h3>
<h3>Snowman (short story collection)</h3>
<h3>Golden Bell (novel)</h3>
<h3>Children's Country (novel)</h3>
<h3>Wild Whirlwind's Fairy Tales (short story collection)</h3>
<h3>Riding the Clouds and Mist (long science story)</h3>
<h3>Two Brothers (novel)</h3>
<h3>Hell (novel)</h3>
<h3>Children's Bridge (short story collection)</h3>
<p>Within these collections, we have not discovered a single work that has a negative influence on children. The era of children's literature that induced children to worship power, worship gold, and be superstitious about luck has passed.</p>
<p>"The Hermit's Beard" collection contains nine short stories: "The Hermit's Beard," "The Story of the Mirror," "The Scientist," "Two Giants and the Great Wild Boar," "Heart to Heart Bazaar," "Baldy," "The Poet and His Son," "The Bee Kingdom," and "Three Questions." These works were created when the Eastern invaders were stationing troops on the East Asian plains, and when the general populace was awakening to the need to live by their own will. These works reflect this era.</p>
<p>In the short story "The Hermit's Beard," the author uses a light touch to describe a hermit who wants to escape reality and the enemy, wanting to hide in a large forest. But reality is, after all, reality; one cannot live without eating or wearing clothes. So the hermit runs to the town, encounters the enemy, and becomes a compliant citizen, a coolie for the enemy. His beautiful beard is cut off and woven into a fine rope tied around his neck, leading him along for the enemy.</p>
<p>In "Two Giants and the Great Wild Boar" in the same collection, the author uses an extraordinary style to describe how the poor people are awakened and how they learn to resist. One giant is a symbol of the poor people's consciousness of resistance, and the other giant is a representative of the rich and powerful. These are two opposing forces at work. As the two giants fight, a great wild boar with ointment marks on its head invades. So the two giants join hands to jointly resist this wild boar, defeat it, and then work together to build many new things.</p>
<p>From these two examples alone, we can already understand the author's intention: the author satirizes backwardness and obedience, and points out the power of unity and resistance. What kind of influence will this have on children's small minds?</p>
<p>Some people think that things written for children to read must have a bit of romantic interest. Fairies and princes can lead children into fantasy, and magical adventures can keep children engrossed. But this is not necessarily the case. Realistic fairy tale themes, as long as they are handled well, can certainly attract children to read. The reading material we give to children is not just for their amusement, but for their education. Children are just like adults; they are people with flesh and blood. They also grow up in this world!</p>
<p>He Yi's efforts in this regard are worthy of our admiration.</p>

<h3>Music and National Boundaries</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lixing</p>
<p>"A nation that has not produced great composers still has the right to appreciate and even understand music. The reason is that music itself is the least likely of all the arts in the world to have national boundaries. Every member of the Germanic nation can be proud of the great musicians that their nation has produced throughout history, but we non-Germanic people can respect their glory for this reason, so why should we harbor a sense of inferiority and make the mistake of discrimination, which has no national boundaries in art itself, get deeper and deeper! I say this is a great mistake, we should not have such prejudice, because music itself is the least likely of any art in the world to have national boundaries!" Alezandre Padereski, in his private notes on music, especially highlighted this excerpt from a brief "address" before a grand symphony concert on a certain date, and repeated it twice. No one can deny that he is the only piano virtuoso after Chopin, and he devoted his life to studying Beethoven's Sonata, attaining its essence and creating his own unique style, becoming a great composer. At the same time, on the international political stage, he was the Prime Minister of Poland shortly after the First World War, and later became the President of the country from Prime Minister. He can be said to be one of the most respected and talented figures in the world in the early years of this century. However, for Germany, the pillar country of the Germanic nation that emerged from Poland due to defeat, he still abandoned the political prejudices that are inevitable and praised the great musicians that the Germanic nation has produced throughout history. He sincerely expressed his utmost admiration.</p>
<p>Throughout history, in fact, today, whoever wants to compile a history of music, let alone if you have no bias, even if you stubbornly cling to "bias", I think you can only do some "unfinished" collection, otherwise you will inevitably be difficult to move an inch! From the 16th century to today, 85% of the great composers who deserve to be called immortal come from Germany and Austria of the Germanic nation. The Teutonic nation accounts for only 3%, and the Slavic nation, far north of the Black Sea, accounts for only 5%. The Roman nation accounts for 7%, as for the Asian nation, it can simply be said to be 0%. Some Chinese even feel that listening to these things is like suffering a kind of punishment. Probably, even if you ask him to study or appreciate it, he still "can't grasp the main points," so where is there any inferiority complex and discriminatory mentality born out of jealousy.</p>
<p>Leaving politics aside, Hitler vigorously publicized the musical talents and great composers that their nation has produced throughout history. Of course, besides asking ourselves if we recognize that we are not as good, shouldn't we think that it is something to be proud of? In fact, great composers who can be called immortal are indeed 85% from their nation. Since three centuries and one leaf, composers of the Germanic nation have always been the main pillars of music history. Over the past two hundred years, they have cultivated the foundation for us to appreciate and study in the future. Tracing back to the source, who can depreciate their "pride"? And who can not ask themselves if they recognize that they are not as good?</p>
<p>Since Johann Sebastien Bach, the excellence of any country to the Germanic nation's contribution to the history of human music has long been established. By the middle of the 19th century, Richard Wagner's bold and vigorous "revival" simply amplified the brilliance of the excellence that the Germanic nation has contributed to the history of human music throughout the ages. At this time, not only could no one depreciate their "pride", not only could no one not ask themselves if they recognized that they were not as good, but everyone applauded and surrendered, but it was also because of this that the national boundaries in music were finally erased. Because of this, the brilliance of music can be immortalized.</p>
<p>As Padereski said: "Music itself is the least likely of any art in the world to have national boundaries!" The people of the world who admire music should remove inferiority, abandon prejudice, and move forward on the road of music!</p>

<h3>A Letter Draft</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>In my drawer, there is a letter draft hidden. It is a small piece of grayish-yellow paper, with a few lines of small fountain pen handwriting on it, the handwriting is scribbled and blurred, revised and revised again; but I love this letter draft, cherish this letter draft; I have carefully preserved it for four years.</p>
<p>That was in January 1942. On the day the Pacific War broke out, my father, who was ill, was arrested by the local Japanese military police because he was a pastor of an American church, and was detained for more than six weeks without being released. All the methods had been exhausted, all the connections had been tried, but they were always ineffective. Finally, in desperation, one night, I listened to the advice of a few friends and tried to write a letter to the military police captain myself, hoping to arouse a little of his conscience and release my sick father. This grayish-yellow piece of paper is the draft of that letter I wrote.</p>
<p>Later, my father was released. Of course, I don't know if it was the merit of that letter, but in my heart, I had no hesitation in feeling that I had done a heroic deed of saving my father with both wisdom and courage. From then on, I regarded the draft of that letter as precious, wrapped it in a handkerchief, carefully hid it in the drawer, patted my chest, and said to myself triumphantly:</p>
<p>One day, I will take this letter draft out for everyone to see! One day, I will tell all my friends who have returned from the rear about this! One day, I will tell everyone how I suppressed my grief and indignation, endured the humiliation, and waved my trembling pen when I wrote this letter that night... One day...</p>
<p>One day... Yes, my expectations were too high, I caressed the letter draft and waited eagerly!</p>
<p>I was not disappointed, "that day" finally came. Friends from afar returned one by one.</p>
<p>The first to see me was Sufang, who came from Chengdu and strode into my room with vigor. I jumped up excitedly and grabbed her hand and said, "Sufang! You've made me wait so hard, I have something to tell you!... " As I said this, I was about to pull open the drawer to take out the letter draft for her to see, but unexpectedly she stopped me with a shout:</p>
<p>"Don't rush! First, look at what's changed on my arm?" She said very quickly and loudly, almost stretching a wind-swept jade arm straight to my brow. I had to patiently look at her arm and replied, "There's nothing changed, but it seems like there's this scar..."</p>
<p>"That's exactly this scar!" Her voice, both urgent and loud, immediately rushed up: "This scar, ah, do you know the origin of this scar? Did you see the news about me published in the ×× newspaper four years ago?..."</p>
<p>It's really amazing! Sufang, who has always been very gentle and calm, has become an impassioned orator after eight years of absence. She gestured and talked about how, when she arrived in the inland, she was willing to sacrifice her superior head nurse position in the hospital to join the air defense rescue team; how she risked danger countless times to rescue thousands and hundreds of injured compatriots; how, in a major bombing four years ago, she ran back and forth in the flames and shrapnel, and finally got injured herself, falling to the ground, blood gurgling out. Then, how she was carried into the hospital by her colleagues, how she was commended by the commander-in-chief, how her name was published in the ×× newspaper that day, and how this permanent memorial, this scar, was left on her arm!...</p>
<p>She spoke excitedly, repeating it over and over again. By the time she finished speaking, it was already dark.</p>
<p>It was dark, so I had to put down the hand that was grabbing the drawer and sent Sufang away.</p>
<p>I was not disappointed, I knew there were other friends who would come, I was waiting.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the second friend came from afar! It was Xiazhen, who was already married.</p>
<p>Like a warm spring breeze blowing in, the radiant glow of Xiazhen's face appeared at my doorway, and my silent room suddenly became lively and energetic.</p>
<p>As usual, I smiled, shook hands, and asked a few words about the hardships of the journey. My hand reached to the side of the drawer again, ready to take out the letter draft that had been treasured for four years.</p>
<p>However, before my hand could grab the drawer, a fragrant thing had been stuffed into the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>The fragrant thing was a beautiful foreign envelope, with a six-inch photo inside. In the photo, there was an airplane, and several noble women were standing in front of the airplane, including Lingzhen.</p>
<p>"Oh, look at this photo, this was taken at the ×× airport the year before last when I was working in the Women's Association in × place and went with several colleagues to welcome Mrs. ×..."</p>
<p>This beautiful young lady, from the photo to the Women's Association, from the Women's Association to Mrs. ×, from Mrs. × to the × important person, from the × important person to her husband, from her husband to a certain magazine, from a certain magazine to her shocking article... it was like the Yellow River bursting its banks, unstoppable.</p>
<p>It was getting dark again, so I asked her to come and talk again the next day because I also wanted to tell her something, but she said; "I can't come! I'm back to see my parents! I'm going back to Shanghai the day after tomorrow, because she's waiting for me in Shanghai to fly to ×× together."</p>
<p>Xiazhen left, and I was a little disappointed. But I was still not disappointed, I knew that there would definitely be other friends who would come to see me.</p>
<p>Yes, other friends came. It was a young man of twenty!</p>
<p>I welcomed this young man with a joyful mood. He was my student from five years ago, a smart and honest child. He did not come from the distant rear, but from the remote mountainous areas of the western countryside.</p>
<p>This time I thought I could finally achieve my wish. I greeted the young man with a smile, and excitedly reached out to open my drawer, but it was terrible!</p>
<p>"Teacher! Teacher - let me tell you! Now I've fired a rifle, a machine gun, a small cannon, a cannon... everything!" As soon as the young man sat down, he kept telling me: "Let me tell you, once when the enemy came to attack Fire Mountain, our troops had just been transferred away and there were only a few people left, so hundreds of students from our school temporarily filled the ranks. At that time, I didn't know how to shoot a gun, so I desperately threw hand grenades at the enemy, and as a result, I killed more than a dozen enemies. Another time..."</p>
<p>By the time the young man finished his achievements in killing the enemy, it was getting dark again. So I withdrew the hand that was preparing to open the drawer again and sent him away.</p>
<p>I was finally a little disappointed.</p>
<p>Now, I still keep that draft. I still love it and cherish it, but I no longer want to take it out for anyone to see, because I know that everyone has a story in their stomach that is greater than mine.</p>
<h3>The Mysterious Door</h3>
<p>— Cangmin</p>
<p>In front of the window of my dwelling, there is a mottled yellow earth wall, no more than four feet away from the window. Therefore, my room is so dark.</p>
<p>Whenever I am tired of reading or in a bad mood, I like to look out of the window, hoping that the window can bring me something. However, now all I can see is the cracks in the yellow earth (it is said that romantic painters can see pictures from this, but I cannot), and the scattered tiles embedded in the soil. Outside the window is a deep lane with no sound.</p>
<p>Every time I look out, all I get is loneliness, loneliness, how unbearable loneliness!</p>
<p>Is the world outside the window really a world of loneliness?</p>
<p>No, I don't think so. On the contrary, it should be a vast world, with countless people struggling and calling out, but this world is completely obscured by this wall.</p>
<p>I stared at the wall outside the window, thinking with the wisdom that God has given to mankind, for a long, long time. The room was incomparably quiet. I lay on the table, letting the breeze flutter my disheveled hair. Suddenly, the wall swayed, and it had a faint sound. Then, a door flashed out from the wall, and a curtain of transparent crystal beads was hanging on the door. From the outside, one could clearly see the scene inside: it seemed like a large room, or like in the wilderness. There were so many people, men, women, old, and young. Their faces were all synonymous with pale, pain, horror, and eyes burned by unbearable hunger. Some were running on the dilapidated road with burdens and children on their backs, and some were sitting on the field sighing. The most touching thing was a woman kneeling on the ground, in front of her was a sick child (seeming like a wounded bird lying motionless), she choked with sobs, stroking her beloved child's pale cheeks with a motherly hand. And behind her was fire, and the sky was filled with the most beautiful colors of the sunset glow, and the arcs drawn by the falling bullets like shooting stars...</p>
<p>I stared at it, motionless for a long time, and that mysterious door was suddenly closed by an unknown force. Now, what is in front of my eyes is still a mottled yellow earth wall.</p>
<p>I sat in front of the window in amazement and tried to understand its entire meaning.</p>
<p>However, I cannot understand this dreamlike image, I only feel that a small insect is crawling in my heart, it makes me feel depressed and painful.</p>
<p>Now my room has returned to its previous quietness, but loneliness has also come from every corner, making people feel the pain of loneliness and suffocation.</p>
<p>May God open this mysterious door again and show me more different things:</p>
<h3>Small Mountain</h3>
<p>— Jingxing</p>
<p>People who have never climbed high mountains and steep ridges are not easy to appreciate the beauty of small mountains, just like a person who lives in a tall building in a city does not understand the structure of a simple thatched hut.</p>
<p>A tall mountain is like a strong woman, with fat buttocks and towering breasts, thick arms and round thighs, everything seems to be rough-lined. A small mountain is different from this, she is like a quiet, lazy girl, secretly peeking at everything nearby with shy eyes.</p>
<p>High mountains use cliffs, peaks, precipices, and deep abysses to create a terrifying picture, as if they want to devour the world. Small mountains do not have these daunting situations, she quietly lies flat on the ground, willingly enduring the trampling of all animals, as docile as a gentle sheep.</p>
<p>On rainy days, a thin veil of smoke envelops her, and the mountain peaks float faintly in the clouds of varying shades, often a trace of mysterious beauty flashes through one's mind. When the clear weather unfolds, the small mountain is clearly exposed in front of people again, a blade of grass, a tree, happily looks at the surroundings in the bright sunlight. At this time, the small mountain shows a calm, harmonious, noble, and gentle atmosphere, such as all the oriental sentiments possessed by a typical oriental girl.</p>
<p>Cloudy days add a more beautiful color to the small mountain. In front of the gray sky, the distance between the small mountain and me seems to be closer, and the edges and corners of a stone can be seen more clearly by me. At this time, she is completely like a girl in love, gazing at the world with a melancholy, sad, worried expression and yet charmingly.</p>
<p>I love the small mountain, I love her ordinariness, I love her gentleness and docility, and I love even more that she does not have the danger of big mountains - like all the dangers in a dark society.</p>
<p>I love the small mountain, I love her shyness and gentleness, I love her selflessness and frankness. Regardless of sunny days, cloudy days, or rainy days, the small mountain always gives people a kind feeling.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Susan</p>
<p>The sunset glow on the horizon constitutes a pattern of blue, yellow, black, and white streaks, and the colorfulness in front of me cannot help but re-ignite the illusions in my heart. However, the once-glossy forehead has added many wrinkles. Looking back at the hazy path, and counting where the end is, standing still - I have fallen into the illusion of nature again.</p>
<p>"Quack - quack - quack" A flock of geese sweeps across the sky, waking me up to the time I should return to my nest. "Birds are tired of flying and know to return home," but where is the end? A desolate wasteland, broken walls and ruins. Does a still-alive childlike heart want to listen to grandpa's "story of the child and the mermaid" again? It's harder than a dream, look, the fleeting clouds are making their thousands of layers of changes again.</p>
<p>Still have to pick up the staggering pace, walking my aimless journey, stepping out to the day of the end.</p>
<p>"Life - death"</p>
<p>"Cradle - grave" Why hesitate so much.</p>
<p>At that time you told me: "The heart used to be like an ancient well, but now it has waves again." What about now? Comparing your mood to an ancient battlefield, and comparing your emotions to the rivers and seas, can you give me your tears, I will thread them together with my needle and thread and hang them on my chest forever.</p>
<p>Darkness layers on layers, and I can no longer see the smiling dimples on the horizon. Groping forward, I call out your name all over the world.</p>
<h3>Alert (Selection of World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— Wen (1847-1910)</p>
<p>Shi · Collection of Glasgow Art Gallery</p>
<p>In terms of animal painting, Shi Wen can be called an unprecedented genius, unmatched by anyone. In his youth, he entered the Huasaite Art School, and at the age of twenty-seven he went to Paris to study painting and sculpture, and was deeply influenced by the Berreists. His famous works include "Dante and the Leopard", "Young Tiger of the Himalayas", "North" and so on. The painting "Alert" is extremely revealing of his outstanding genius.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 17</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand your meaning -- now there are only two paths; either return to your original defense area, or detour to Fengtai." The fellow's attitude gradually changed, and the true face of the "pig" gradually resurfaced.</p>
<p>"Let's consider it!" Little Tiger and I got out of the car one after the other. In the hazy glow of the car lights, I could only see the silhouettes of the two fellows retreating a few feet away; everything else was blurred.</p>
<p>"Please get in the car!" The two fellows had already drawn their guns. "On the battlefield, orders must be strictly obeyed."</p>
<p>"Then you have to listen to my orders!" I said, pulling out my gun with one hand and reaching out with the other, trying to pull Little Tiger behind me.</p>
<p>Before I could finish speaking, they both raised their guns and fired. I felt a sudden jolt in my body and stumbled sideways against the car body, landing right on the footboard of the car. My gun had slipped from my hand and I didn't know where it had flown.</p>
<p>A miracle also happened under the sound of the guns; Little Tiger, this thirteen-year-old child, I don't know when or with what agility, had already pounced forward; with just this one move, he had already knocked one down - precisely that half-cut tree stump-like pig - and rolled all the way, falling into the shadows. The remaining driver, however, holding a gun, followed Little Tiger, a monkey-like black shadow, shooting left and right. I only saw that black shadow flashing back and forth two or three times, and then suddenly leaped, his whole body like a cannonball, thrown at the driver, knocking the driver down. I only heard a grunt, and then neither of them moved. The whole process of these actions probably only took a few seconds.</p>
<p>"Uncle," Little Tiger, a small black lump-like shadow, squatted beside the fallen driver, quietly calling to me, "Are you hurt?" Then there was a flash of light from a flashlight. Under this light, it illuminated one person lying on the ground and another standing beside them searching.</p>
<p>I stood up, just about to warn Little Tiger about something, when I saw his searching shadow flash and run to a place more than ten feet away, and then turn on the flashlight again.</p>
<p>"All done, Uncle!"</p>
<p>"What happened?" I was somewhat doubtful and walked over.</p>
<p>"Look." He turned on the flashlight again, the light focused on the place where the pig lay fallen.</p>
<p>The scene illuminated by this round beam of light seemed to explain that the world is so big that many "believe it or not" events can happen; the deputy captain, or "pig," lay on his back on the ground, his gun gone, his limbs twitching slightly, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth, his mouth wide open, and his eyes bulging out, adding a bit more ferocious charm.</p>
<p>"Here!" Little Tiger knew I was searching for the location of his fatal strike, and tapped the fellow's neck with his toe. Looking at it this way was indeed a bit gruesome, because his entire throat had shifted position, as if something like a hook had hooked onto it and pulled it outward, the flesh of the throat swollen and hanging down in a two or three inch flap; pressing down on one corner of the collar of his shirt.</p>
<p>The driver was injured in the chest, and it also seemed like some kind of iron weapon had plunged straight through the clothes, with considerable depth.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the Church</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Of all the religions, Christianity's work, life, and behavior can be said to be the most engaged with the world. Christians do not seek to hide in the mountains and forests, nor do they meticulously seek personal afterlife. Although they have the goal of entering heaven, they believe that they must be humble, mournful, gentle, hunger and thirst for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and persecuted for righteousness; and their social view is unreserved love.</p>
<p>In the colorful and vibrant Shanghai, even in the most dirty and filthy places, a mission station is set up there, rain or shine, the doors open, and the Bible is taught on time. Even if there is only one listener, even if this one listener is not there wholeheartedly, but is there to rest and dodge the rain, the person on the platform is not bothered by it at all, and still eloquently expounds his ideas. Many people may think this is a urban irony, a cruel farce, but after a long time, you will naturally be inspired by his perseverance.</p>
<p>The church places service as its primary importance, because unlike the ordinary world of deception and competition for fame and profit, it often leads people to see it in reverse, thinking that their kind and harmonious attitude is hypocritical, or has some purpose, which seems quite sad, but this has no impact on them.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the church suffered great damage. After the victory, they started anew with renewed vigor. Many old foreign pastors and missionaries came out of concentration camps and returned to their original positions. For example, Mr. Bu Fangji, the president of St. John's University, at the age of ninety, is now preparing to return to Shanghai from the United States! This is something that a person who only plans for themselves cannot understand.</p>
<p>Sincerity, love, humility, service, perseverance -- this spirit of the church should be advocated even more in this chaotic social state where the world is surging and people forget righteousness for profit.</p>
<h3>In the Examination Hall</h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>— A Proctor's Words</p>
<p>I felt proud and joyful when I walked out of the office with a red badge with the words "Proctor" pinned on my lapel!</p>
<p>I stepped into the classroom, and row upon row of dark heads were already filled with the incoming freshmen. Under the gaze of hundreds of anxious eyes, I stood on the platform with feigned authority and solemnly said to them:</p>
<p>"If the handwriting is illegible, you may ask within ten minutes after the exam papers are distributed. No other questions will be answered. No books or papers are allowed on the desks or chairs. Please pay attention!"</p>
<p>The exam papers were distributed, assisted by two friends who, like me, wore the "Proctor" badge. We stood at the front, middle, and back, and walked around from time to time. We were vigilant and scrutinized every tense face as if they contained hostility!</p>
<p>"Please note!" After walking around twice, I suddenly remembered, "Please take out your admission tickets!"</p>
<p>So, like examining something, the three of us squeezed through the narrow gaps between the seats, comparing each photo with their faces to see if they matched! I saw every face covered with sweat, tense and distressed. I suddenly felt an indescribable feeling. It seemed a little too cruel to these students who had endured the heat and sweated to take the exam! However, for the sake of the dignity and responsibility caused by this red badge, I had to check!</p>
<p>To be honest, the questions were so difficult that I dare say few of the freshmen could hope to pass. Look! Those anxious faces, frowning and sighing, perhaps the aspirations they had long cherished would be dashed because of this?</p>
<p>I clasped my hands behind my back and pretended to be relaxed, pacing from time to time. Sometimes, I felt several students' eyes sweep over me like lightning and then lower their heads in fear. What were they afraid of? I'm not a tiger, am I? If we were all studying in the same classroom, wouldn't we be classmates? Thinking of this, I sighed wearily, sat down lightly on the platform, lowered my head, and immersed myself in reverie!</p>
<p>Suddenly --</p>
<p>"How can you bring this?"</p>
<p>I raised my head and saw another "Proctor" shouting at a timid freshman like this, holding a booklet of lecture notes tightly in his hand!</p>
<p>A pleading, ashamed face did not elicit sympathy. The "Proctor" expressionlessly brought his exam paper over and placed it on the platform.</p>
<p>A distressed, flushed face walked past me dejectedly, tears glistening in the corners of his eyes!</p>
<p>Who made him like this? The school? The exam questions? Or the "Proctor"? As for the proctor, it was to fulfill their duty, but that cheating student was also pitiful!</p>
<p>In order to limit the number of students admitted, the exam standards have been raised especially, which is currently unavoidable for the school authorities, but the students are at a loss because of this, which is also sympathetic!</p>
<h3>Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Chang Lin</p>
<p>Parent: "School is about to start, and I have no way to pay my children's tuition fees. I have no way to borrow money. What should I do?"</p>
<p>Merchant A: "Why worry so much? I'll lend it to you. The interest will be according to the market."</p>
<p>Parent: "The tuition fees are huge and difficult to bear. Can I repay the principal and interest together after my child graduates?"</p>
<p>Merchant A: "Compound interest calculation is fine..."</p>
<p>Merchant B: "Calculated at a rate of one point six fen per dollar, borrowing one million yuan, the total principal and interest after ten years will be 1,028,576,000,000 yuan."</p>
<p>Recalling Old Events</p>
<h3>Thinking of the Rong Case -- Shanghai Kidnapping Cases in the Past Twenty Years</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Rong case's main culprit Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongzhu and other eight people, was finally executed by the garrison headquarters.</p>
<p>Rong Desheng's kidnapping was the first major kidnapping case in Shanghai after the victory, with a ransom of 500,000 US dollars. It was eventually detected by Mao Sen, the second director of the First Pacification District Headquarters. The twists and turns of the case have been scattered in various newspapers. The Rong case leads people to generally recall several major kidnapping cases that occurred in Shanghai in the past.</p>
<p>The earliest was the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, the son-in-law of Shanghai tycoon Zhu Bao San, followed by the kidnapping of Huang Boxian, the owner of the Times, both of which were spread throughout the streets and alleys as good material for chit-chat.</p>
<p>Later, there was the news of the kidnapping of Guanghua University President Zhang Shou Yong on Daxi Road. Zhang was then serving as the Deputy Minister of Finance. It was theoretically impossible to privately redeem the ransom, but Zhang was eager to save his son and finally redeemed him with a large sum of money. Therefore, the reports at that time were published vaguely, but there were still traces to be found.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, there was a period when kidnapping became very popular, and those with even a little property dared not go out alone. It is said that someone was walking on the road when suddenly kidnappers threatened them with guns. When they walked to the entrance of the Rising Sun Building on Nanjing Road, the person suddenly became desperate and urinated in their pants. The patrolmen intervened and twisted them to the patrol station, but they escaped danger because of this.</p>
<p>In 1940, Shanghai, which became an isolated island, became a world of terror. Kidnapping cases emerged endlessly. Famous examples include the kidnapping of Yue Ren Tang Li Shan, the husband of movie star Ruan Lingyu, in front of his apartment on Racecourse Road in November, and the kidnapping of Zhao Dianxiao, the son of Zhao Shuyong, a member of the "Central Political Committee" of the puppet regime. The kidnapping of Zhao's son had demanded 2 million yuan, but was later detected by the concession police in conjunction with the Japanese gendarmerie. The culprit was actually the "commander" of the puppet "Shanghai West Self-Defense Corps" at the time.</p>
<p>Among the kidnapping cases in 1941, the kidnapping of Jin Huating, the manager of the Shanghai Jiang Copper Factory (this Jin Huating is not the late famous reporter Jin Huating), and the kidnapping of Zhang Boju, the director of Yu Ye Bank, can be considered the "major ones". The most noteworthy was the kidnapping of Legislative Yuan member Luo Yunyan from his residence on Jisi Feier Road in Shanghai West by enemy troops. Luo had retired to Shanghai after the war and was enthusiastic about education. The purpose of kidnapping him was to coerce Luo to publish a "peace" communiqué in order to mobilize people. The despicable and shameless behavior of the Japanese army was infuriating!</p>
<p>Recently, after the Rong case, there was also the kidnapping case of Fujian sugar merchant Xue Jianqiu, which was solved within fourteen hours. The culprit, Zhang Yuchan, claimed to have served as the "Commander of the Zhejiang East Guerrilla." In this kidnapping, the ransom was paid at the police station, and the hostage was hidden in the city government. It was truly audacious and could be called "unprecedented," opening a new chapter!</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang is About to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>Character Sketch</p>
<p>General Wei Lihuang is about to go to the United States to inspect military affairs and study new tactics and new weapons. Many people have a deep memory of General Wei. Perhaps everyone will not forget Lihuang, the capital of Anhui Province during the war, but do you know its origin?</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago, Lihuang County was still an extremely barren town. At that time, tens of thousands of national troops fought over the town for more than a month, but they could not conquer it. Later, the highest authorities issued an emergency order, limiting them to capture it within a week. At the same time, whoever broke in first would have the town named as a county, and the county's name would be named after the commander of the troops that entered the area.</p>
<p>At that time, several division commanders received the order and held a meeting to plan the deployment of each route, but no one dared to go the most difficult route. As a result, General Wei volunteered and said, "I'll go--" Unexpectedly, he succeeded first. As a result, Anhui permanently had the city of Lihuang.</p>
<p>From then on, he became famous throughout the country, and his career flourished, from division commander to army commander. In August 1935, he was honorably appointed as the Commander of the Cleansing of the Four Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui. In 1937, because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in distress in Xi'an, he made great achievements in handling the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi, and Rong was awarded the first-class medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force by the National Government.</p>
<p>When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, General Wei was stationed on the Jinan battlefield, commanding the various units of the First War Zone, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, causing the Japanese invaders to be mired in the Central Plains battlefield and indirectly protecting the heart of the Great Northwest -- Xi'an.</p>
<p>In 1943, General Wei was transferred to Kunming, and then transferred to command the Expeditionary Force, fighting bloody battles on the India-Burma battlefield for more than three years; in the joint operations of the British and American allied forces, he commanded his troops, fully demonstrating the spirit of the Chinese army's war. All the Allied officers and soldiers who participated in the India-Burma campaign praised him for his detached and outstanding command.</p>
<p>Therefore, he also received the Medal of Honor from the American authorities.</p>
<p>General Wei admires two people in his life, one is the Soviet military leader Voroshilov, and the other is the French General Foch. The reason why General Wei became famous is of course due to their two generals.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Reflections</p>
<h3>Yu Xiangyan Surrenders</h3>
<p>— Chong Zheng</p>
<p>Yu Xiangyan, who had been missing for two months, suddenly surrendered, breaking the deadlock in the Two-Roads Bureau corruption case. It was something no one would have expected. I believe, and hope, that the whole case will be revealed because of this.</p>
<p>Two days ago, this magazine happened to mention this issue, and offered two suggestions: 1. Yu Xiangyan should step forward, 2. I hope to hear the outcome. Unexpectedly, the next day's newspaper published the news that "Yu Xiangyan surrendered."</p>
<p>Now, we can hear the truth. Who is right and who is wrong will soon be revealed to society. Civil servants who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law should be commended, and those who are corrupt and fraudulent must be severely punished! This is a matter of course?</p>
<p>According to the various points stated by Yu Xiangyan after his surrender, many people are involved, and the situation seems unusually complicated. However, before obtaining formal evidence, we dare not make any rash comments. Everything awaits legal exploration and judgment! In addition to deeply believing that the authorities will surely enforce the law like a mountain and punish corruption, we also hope for two things: 1. Yu Xiangyan is best not the protagonist of the case, but serves as the reporter and witness of the corruption in the case, so as to comply with the various points stated in her two letters to this newspaper; 2. The relationship between Director Chen and the police department with the case, as stated, is best not true!</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Newspaper World</p>
<h3>Coincidence</h3>
<p>— Gang Guo</p>
<p>Two Major Encyclopedias, East and West</p>
<p>In the era when this newspaper was run by the British Major brothers (Frederic and Ernest Major), from 1885 to 1888, the "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Illustrations and Books" was reprinted in movable type. This huge book of 1,628 volumes is one of the most important encyclopedias in our country. Westerners call it the "Kangxi Encyclopedia" (Kang Hsi Imperial Encyclopedia), and the edition printed by this newspaper is called the "Major Bros. Edition".</p>
<p>Recently, I read an article in the Christian Science Monitor commenting on the London Times, which mentioned that the Times reprinted the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1898, with each set attached with a beautifully crafted oak book box, which sold very well. The Times was experiencing financial difficulties at that time, and relied on this to tide over the difficulties. The two major newspapers in the East and West, almost at the same time, were famous for reprinting large-scale encyclopedias. It can be said that it is a coincidence.</p>
<p>Right Elder's Virtuous Governance</p>
<p>We, the reporters who send news telegrams, as well as all the newspapers and news agencies, must thank Mr. Yu Youren for the convenience and benefits he has given us.</p>
<p>According to the current regulations of the Ministry of Communications' telegraph regulations, news telegrams are charged at a quarter of the price of ordinary telegrams, and urgent news telegrams are charged at a quarter of the price of ordinary telegrams plus four times the fee (that is, equal to half the telegraph fee of urgent commercial telegrams). The sender has a news telegram license, and the fee can be paid by the recipient. This kind of benefit and convenience was not enjoyed by reporters and newspapers when domestic telegrams were first connected at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Later, news telegrams were only reduced by half.</p>
<p>It was not until 1912, when Mr. Yu Youren was the Minister of Communications, that news telegrams were reduced by three-quarters compared to commercial telegrams. Before entering politics, Mr. Yu was a senior in the newspaper industry, having founded the Shenzhou, Minhu, Minxu, and Minli newspapers. He deeply knew the hardships of the newspaper industry, so he was particularly able to take care of the welfare of the newspaper industry when he was the Minister of Communications. We are still benefiting from him to this day. I wonder how many people know about the virtuous governance he left behind during his short tenure in communications administration?</p>
<h3>Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Shi Daoai, Translated by Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Many people know Sherlock Holmes and love to read this type of book. But do you know where Sherlock Holmes came from? Here is the story of Sherlock Holmes's birth. Are you willing to listen?</p>
<p>London in 1886, on the surface, looked very similar to London in previous years. Queen Victoria continued to sit safely on her throne. Conservative Party leader Salisbury Binley once again drove his political enemy Gladestone from the Prime Minister's seat. Ireland was disturbed by riots and rebellions; and Beechum's pills were universally recognized as an effective treatment for nervous disorders. In the literary world, according to the author's age, the chief may be Stevenson, Henry James, and Henty; but an Irishman named Wilde made himself a model of the fantasy era as a priest of aesthetics. In the theater world, Cellier's "Dorothy" was celebrating its 968th performance at the Happy Theatre, and "Lighthouse" was shining brightly at the Adelphi Theatre. In Piccadilly, horse races were fast and dangerous. There was no impending war, and the vast world was at peace. This was a clean and happy era, a rich and fulfilling era. There were also no astronomical phenomena to indicate an epoch-making event. As the history of the world has indicated more than once, a blue moon is a sign of the birth of an extraordinary person. Indeed, no planet fell to tell a poor rural doctor living in Southsea, near Linzmouth Port, that he had led a new immortal character into the world of literature.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had come into the world at this time. Accompanied by Dr. Watson, who was temporarily serving in the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, Holmes rented a room at 221B Baker Street in London and engaged in his amazing private detective business. He will exist there forever when this world is still being cared about.</p>
<p>A Person Who Knows Detectives Well</p>
<p>Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle of Southsea, near Lyndhurst, was not having a good time. This young man had just married, and he supplemented his early medical career with the small fees he earned from writing articles for magazines. He was very likely to write short stories forever without making progress. He was convinced that it was necessary, if a person wanted to become a writer, to have their name on the cover of a book. His first novel—The Firm of Girdlestone—was a miserable failure, and the manuscript was still in the house. But he often thought about the possibility of creating a fresh style in detective literature. The simplicity of the plot of the works of Gabo Lio made him like and cherish the capable amateur detective Dupin, who was his childhood hero. What about these? he asked himself. If Doyle could bring these into the garden of detective literature, it would undoubtedly become his own.</p>
<p>Outside his door, at night, a red light was lit, which was the sign of his profession. During the day, the copper plate engraved with his name, which was cleaned every morning, shone brightly in the Southsea sunlight. But the patients attracted by these two signs were very few. In the waiting room, there were three chairs, a rug, and a small piece of carpet. As he sat there smoking and thinking, the figure of a professor from his university appeared before him—a professor named Joseph Bell, thin, strong, swarthy, with a high nose, sharp face, shrugged shoulders, and gray and sharp eyes, a professor who walked in a very special way, Joseph Bell, Doctor of Medicine from the University of Edinburgh, surgeon at the Royal Infirmary and the Royal Children's Hospital, his tone was high and discordant, his surgical skills were very profound, and his mysterious diagnostic skills were a legend of the medical school. This matter, as seen by the young doctor waiting for the patients who did not come, if Bell decided to become a detective, he would make "this fantastic and lifeless career become something close to a complete science."</p>
<p>Bell, for reasons that Doyle, the student, would never fully understand, took him out of a group of students in the ward to be his outpatient assistant. This was not a heavy task, he only needed to arrange the order of the patients waiting for consultation, record simple conditions, and then lead them into a large room, where Bell sat quietly. But the young Doyle immediately understood one thing: Bell only needed to glance at the patient, and he knew more than he knew from head to toe.</p>
<p>"He sat in his consulting room," Doyle, the novelist of the time, wrote, "like an Indian. When the patient stepped into the room, before he opened his mouth: he was already diagnosing. He would tell the patient what their symptoms were, and even say what their past lives were like, but he would rarely be wrong."</p>
<p>The author tells us that many results are often dramatic. Once, he observed a civilian patient say: "Oh, you served in the army, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"You haven't been discharged for long?"</p>
<p>"That's right, sir."</p>
<p>"Belonging to the Scottish Highlands Corps?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"A non-junior officer?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Stationed in Barbados? [Note: British West Indian territory.]"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Pay attention, everyone," the doctor explained to the students and assistants surrounding him, "this gentleman is a respectable figure, but he didn't take off his hat. People in the army don't take off their hats; if he had been discharged for a long time, he should have learned civilian etiquette. His demeanor is very powerful, and he is obviously a Scotsman. Regarding Barbados, because his symptoms are elephantiasis, this disease is prevalent in the West Indies, and it is not seen in Britain."</p>
