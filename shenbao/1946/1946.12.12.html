<h3>國都問題展開辯論　第一審查會中掌聲不絕　張斷發方贊成建都北平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲單中最受人注意之國都問題，十一日午於第一審委會中展開熟烈辯論，主張建都北平者，以張繼作前鋒，主張建都南京者，推劉百閔爲發言人，社會賢達仇鰲則提出第三種主張，建議建於最艱苦之西安，各逞雄辯，自四時一刻起至六時止，商討歷時幾近二小時，仍未獲最後給論，定十二日上午九時續商，屆時恐尚將有一塲激辯。張知本於討論國旗問題即宣布討論總綱第七條國都問題，全塲一致鼓掌，空氣頓由沉寂轉爲熟鬧，主張建都北平之遼寗代表張輯顏，首起發言，認此問題爲定都，應非建都問題，盼能一本良心，多爲國家民族着想，繼就歷史觀點指出建都北平之優點，以明淸爲例，說明定都北平國家可長治久安，而在南京之梁武帝及民國，皆多內憂外患，就地理而論，北平亦利於防守，不若南京勿受威脅，並說明當年日人覬覦東北，即因我政府遠在南京，無暇計及華北，當更無力兼顧東北，乃發動九一八事件。决起發言者爲仇　，渠雖爲湘籍，然爲全局打算，力主建都西安，其理由爲我人建都應擇最艱苦與最需而救濟之地點，西北日趨荒冷，人口日減，我人不應貪岡南京或北平舒服，遂遺忘西北，請勿忘生於憂患之古訓。至是，黨國元老張繼發言，全塲熱烈鼓掌，張首說明國都在全部憲法中爲最重要最具體之間題，盼勿意氣用事，此事非南北之爭，亦非黨派之爭，國民黨對此亦未有所決議，故儘有討論自由。决分析有關建都問題提案，認主張建都南京者僅絕少數，而贊成建都北平者佔絕大多數，盼勿違反眾人之意。張解釋國父主張建都南京本旨，據稱：本人可謹填謂，國父主張建都南京，係一時之事，非永久的，就環境與現實言，本人贊成建都北平，有人反對建都該地者，以該地昆連強鄰，恐不安全，惟應知生於憂患之古語，越危險越應遷往，即我國軍事權威陳誠將軍等，最近與談及時，亦有此種看法，我人若再建都南京，非亡國不可，語單，眾大鼓掌。贊成憲法中不規定國都所在地之原提案人何遂發言，認憲法爲永久性的，不應將流動性之國都問題列人在此原子彈時代，若有戰爭，南京固須遷都，北平一樣遷，不若不規定爲好。河北代表以幽默語調駁斥建都南京，據謂：國父當年建都南京，係因該地封建色彩太濃，軍閥勢力根深蒂固，且有外國勢力，目前上述種種咸己一掃而空且此次提案，蘇·浙·粵等省代表均有連署者，可見非僅係北方代表意見，芳謂房屋不數，北平谷機關皆在遷平後即可辦公，並說明即有事實困難，憲法決定後，非立即實行，仍　延遲。平代表孫純武及綏代表祁必厚，代表二萬萬人民三個民族發言，主張建都北平，吳曉道根據邊疆及國防原因，主張建都南京，並說明遷都之困難，芳謂決定後可暫不遷，此無異開一空頭支票。賀揚靈謂，憲章規定建都南京，各黨派皆予同意，並說明歷史不足爲建都北平強有力證明，而明太社，洪秀全與孫總理三革命政府，皆建都南京。任卓宣認國都爲一事，外患又爲一事，建都北平同樣曾發生喪權辱國之事，此事應指責政府，而不應批評地點。劉百閔反駁張繼理論，認國父不但一時主張建都南京，實業計劃中且有永久建都南京計劃，南京實爲革命首都，並請記住日人在南京大屠殺故事，激辯至六時，請求發言者仍踴躍，定十二日繼續討論。</p>
<h3>第二審查委會通過　確定國大職權　國大爲行駛權之最高機關</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第二審委會十一日上午九時開第四次全體會於大會會塲出席代表二五七人，張強主席首由林彬報吿提案之整理工作尚未完竣，深致歉意。繼邵力子建議爲經濟時間，請免將廣泛意見歸倂整理，並謂可即就提案加以討論俟整理工作完成，再迅速付諸表決，孔庚等立即反對，謂非惟過去之廣泛意見須併案整理，目前仍要繼續廣泛討論，於是各代表紛紛發言，至十一時五十分宣吿散會。</p>
<p>下午三時四十分繼續開會於大會會塲，出席代表二一一人，朱鴻儒主席，開始依憲草對第三章「國民大會」逐條討論，大部代表主張須規定國大之性質，雖經邵力子與陶希聖力主應據憲草討論，會眾仍通過於章首加入「國民大會爲中華民國國民行使政權之最高機關」，作爲第二十六條，原第二十六條推後爲第二十七條，並部份修改爲「國民大會以左列代表組織之（一）每縣市及其同等區域各選出代表一人，其人口逾三十萬者，增選代表一人（二）蒙古各旗西藏地方及少數民族之名額，由法律另定之」。立監委爲國大代表之規定，均被刪除，職蒙及僑民代表之規定以時間不敷，留待十二日繼續討論，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>憲草「總統」章　審查工作完成</h3>
<p>第三審委會昨續開會</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第三審委會十一日上午九時開第四一次全體會，出席代表一一二人，一史尚寬主席，繼續討論憲草「總統」章各條，除第四十四條修改爲「國家遇有緊急事變，天然災書（以下「癘疫」二字刪去），或國家財政，經濟上有重大變故，須爲急速處分時，總統於立法院休會期間，得經行政院會議之決護，依緊急命令法發布緊急命令，爲必要之處置，但須於發布命令後一個月內，提交立法院追認，如立法院不同意時，該緊急命令立即失效」。此外，第四十五至五十三等九條均通過維持原文，第四章之審查工作於以完成，至十二時正散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕憲草第三審委會十日開第三次會時，對第四章「總統」各條作詳盡之討論，除第三十六，三十七，四十，四十二，四十三等五條照原文通過外，第三十八條以內容牽運甚一行討論，第三十九條修改爲「總統依本憲法（原「第六十三條」五字刪去）之規定定，行使締結條約及宣戰媾和之權」。第四十一條修改爲「總統依法行使（原「大赦」兩字刪去（特赦，減刑，復權之權（以下第二項「前項關於特赦，減刑及復權事項由司法行政部部長依法提請總統行之」字句全刪）」，第四十四條因涉及立法院休會之問題，未及立即獲致結果。待十一日討論。</p>
<h3>政院院長出缺　由副院長代理</h3>
<p>第三審委會之決議</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第三審委會下午三時四十分繼續開會於第一休息室，出席代表一〇九人，仍由史尚寬主席。開始憲草修正案第五章「行政」部分之審查工作，第五十四，五十五兩條，均順利通過，第五十六條則於一小時之熱烈討論後，依王世杰所提之修正案通過，加入行政院副院長，於院長缺位時代理之規定，將其修改爲「行政院院長，由總統提名，經立法院同意任命之。立法院休會期閒，行政院院長辭職或出缺時，由行政院副院長代理其職務，但須於四十日內，咨請立法院召集會議，提出行政院院長人選徵求同意。行政院院長職務，在總統所提出之行政院院長人選未經立法院同意前，由行政院副院長暫行代理。」第五十七條加入副院長之任命一點，修改爲「行政院副各部會首長，及不管部會之政務委員，由行政院院長提請總統任命之。」下午五時廿分，開始第五十八條之討論會，眾對行政院就某些事項對立法院負責一點，爭執極烈，至六時散會時，猶無結論，定十二日上午九時繼續開會討論。</p>
<h3>中宣部記者會　解答制憲問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕中央宣傳部定十三日下午二時，假中山東路重慶安樂廳，舉行中外記者招待會，屆時將請靑年黨左舜生，解答有關國大制憲問題。</p>
<h3>「雙十二」紀念　臨潼西安無擴大儀式</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十一日電〕記者凌晨由臨　歸來，沿路朔風冰霜，寒氣堪與十年前今晨之飄雪相比。臨潼谷界塈軍官總隊，十二日無特殊擴大之念儀式，誌此十年前中華民族史上轉捩點，西安市十二日亦無擴大紀念儀式，想係留待廿五日一併舉行。</p>
<h3>憲草總綱第一條　中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國　經第一審委會多數通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草總綱第一條，經第一審委會十一日第四次會議再付表決，出席一五三人，以一〇七票多數通過，修改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」，惟靑年黨代表常塲聲明該案旣經以絕對多數通過，少數黨不擬再在會中發表意見，惟保留發言權，俾在大會中發言。民社黨對第一條亦保留發言權。又憲草總綱第二條原文爲：「中華民國之主權屬於人民全體」，亦以一百十六票之多數改爲「中華民國之主權屬於國民全體」。原案第三條「具有中華民國國籍者，爲中華民國國民」會中一致無異議照原案通過。</p>
<p>第一審會係十一日晨九時三刻假中央黨部舉行，張知本王席，言討論如何處理昨日會中表決而未過牛數之總綱第一條問題，當時意見可分成兩派，靑年黨閔達，周竇三等主張將昨日討論結果送綜合委會審查，江萬平等附議，惟多數代表咸主將各種意見於今日會中再付審查，蓋根據國大議事規則第五十條「經表決仍無可決之結果，如係不得廢棄之議題，應再付審查」，閔達等認二决審查不合法，堅主提交綜合會，且一度表示退出，會塲空氣相常緊張，民社黨李俊夫起而說明「會塲內外大多數人之意見」，未說畢即有若十代表起立說話，秩序極亂幸經召集人之一黃少谷高聲發言，說明情形，並謂「引起此種誤會，很爲可惜」，會塲乃復歸平靜。旋表決應吾送综合委會，當時在塲一五四人僅七十一人贊成，不滿牛數，惟爲此事棄涉政治問題，並保持會塲和諧計，再作反表決，贊成繼續討論者八十二人，乃繼續進行審查，，先決定於票數最多之兩案中表決，「中華民國爲基於三民主義之民主共和國」，僅得三十三票，遭否決，「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」以一〇七票之大多數通過，全塲一致鼓掌。</p>
<p>至此同，可北代表吳延環起而發言謂：「余爲國民黨員，願意湊合事實，不斤斤於文字之爭」。靑年黨代表閔達則鄭貢聲明謂「此一問題旣經表決，贊成者佔絕對多數，少數黨之意見不擬再在會中發表，惟保留發言權，俾在大會中發言」，與會者對此種精神，咸鼓掌表示贊同</p>
<p>此關係重大之第一條通過後，各代表乃平心靜氣繼續討論第二條，該條原文爲「中華民國之主權，屬於人民全體」，代表對該案共提出九個修正案，歸納可成大類，最重要之更動爲主張將「人民「兩字改爲「國民」。靑年黨夏爾康即認「人民」與「國民」不同，不能引爲一談，江蘇代表周　山謂：若用「人民」，即與前言及第三條前後不符，並指出民元臨時的法即規定「屬於國民」。職業代表江萬平亦認我人以國民代表資格來會，何以不用「國民」，任草宣認外國僑民來我國居住，得享人民權利，惟未取得國籍不爲我國民，故非主權來源，主權應來自取得國籍之國民。</p>
<p>陳顧遠謂：憲草所以用「人民」而不用「國民」，如有其原因，同時主權在國民，容易由人民主權說變成國家主權說，演成德國式之集權國家，希望原起草人說明。吳經熊乃起而報吿，說明約法及天壇憲法規定，謂根據後者主權屬於「人民」，並指出屬於人民與間於政府之不同點，惟認此點作爲字面上之之權，最後宜付表決，當時在場一百六十人，以一一六票之多數，通過將「人民」，改爲「國民」，全文改爲「中華民國之主權，屬於國民全體」，全塲亦一致鼓掌。</p>
<p>繼討論第三條「具有中華民國國籍者，爲中華民國國民」，全塲一致無異議贊成維持原案，修正案不予討論。</p>
<h3>憲法對領土問題　通過採概括方式</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲法對領土應如何予以規定一點，第一審查會十一日上下午開會時，曾詳加討論，並經多數表決，將原案「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域非依法律不得變更之」修改爲「中華民國領土依其固有之疆域，非經國民大會之決議，不得變更之」。第五條「中華民國各民族一律平等」及第六條一中華民國國旗定爲紅地左上角靑天白日」略經討論後，咸通過維持原案。</p>
<h3>第六審委會　開五六次會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕憲草第六審委會十一日舉行第五，六兩决會，分別由谷正鼎，方少雲担往主席，全日共通過一一四條，一一六條，一一八條，一一九條四條，一一五條則推張維，阮毅成，張伯倫，鄧翔海，李鈺，方少雲，劉中一七人整理，再交大會討論。一一七條由召集人請起草人於十二日出席說明後討論。一二〇條決定十二日繼續討論後再整理。</p>
<h3>第七審查委會　兩組工作結束</h3>

<h3>民社黨發表聲明　對國家之名稱保留意見　請待綜合委會重付表決</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕民社黨發言人蔣勻田，十一日晚發　表談話稱：今晚本黨會議，根據出席憲草各審委會召集人報告，有所決議，本人茲奉命作如下聲明：（一）今日憲草第一審委會對憲草第一章第一條修改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」，本黨代表當即書面聲明，保留少數當意見。（二）今日憲草第三審委會對憲草第四章第四十四條增加「緊急事變」四字，本黨代表當即聲明，保留少數黨意見，一倂留待綜合審委會請求軍付表決。假使少數黨意見不能獲得多數黨尊重老慮，則本黨對參加制憲工作，將考慮適常辦法。蔣氏又稱：第三方面人士消息，謂本黨少數領袖主張實行淸黨，絕無其事。</p>
<h3>審委會風浪洶湧</h3>
<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>——吵架·退席·新聞記者被擋駕</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日〕第一審委會討論第一條時，對應吾貢行討論一點，引起軒然大波，靑年黨黨員幾至退席。閔達，周竇三等戴帽携書預備走出，後爲其他代表勸止。昨日要求退席之民社黨李俊夫，今日因代表不准其報吿，又鬧退席，惟爲在旁者勸住。</p>
<p>討論主權屬於「人民」抑「國民」時，某廣東代表與吳經熊大談英女，陳顧遠大談其主權來源，說者謂今日之會有似上大學「比較憲法」課。</p>
<p>江萬平之言最妙，渠謂：「同人等係以國民代表資格出席國大，憲法中何以不用「國民」而用「人民」，言畢哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>吳延環代表謂，領土決不可變更，再有失地情形，地下列祖列宗必將罵我們「不是好小子」。</p>
<p>女代表郭昌鶴大聲疾呼，反對領土採列舉法，據稱「我們過去的土地，香港等地我們亦要收回，國家鎮士不能爲本屆國大所斷送！」</p>
<p>第二審委會開會時，又「廣泛討論」，老孔庚一講講了十幾分鐘，靑年黨代表朱瑞熙起立請主席張強注意發言時間，孔老頭子大大的冒了火，他的十幾個小集團，也一躍而起，四面入方奔到朱的座位周圍，手指口斥，大輿問罪之師，幾有動武之勢。張主席大聲疾呼「秩序」，才把這全武行的局勢壓下去。朱代表在大多數人同情下，一聲不響的坐了一會，就退席了。孔老頭子又一躍上台說：「剛才因爲某某代表予涉我的發言權，引起了秩序的混亂，這眞是『一犬吠影，百犬吠聲」……」舉座聽得坐立不安，他又搖頭擺腦的大發「宏論」起來。</p>
<p>總統章第四十五條，關於總統得召集各有關院長會商解決院間爭執一點，在政協憲草審議會裏就有爭辯，結果是民社黨讓步了。不想第三審委會裏國民黨代表之問又發生了不同的意見。王世杰，羅鼎主張刪去，潘公展主張保留，表決之後以四十四票較多數，維持原案，潘打了勝仗。</p>
<p>豫區代表何紼情又大發「預備總統」的妙論，如何，如何，冀職代表張子揚馬上站起來：「本席反對這位代表的意見，「預備總統」沒有必要，如果要選「預備總統」，那麼「名譽總統』等等也可以選了！」結果付表決，第一次贊成「預備總統」的只有何一人，第二次原領銜提案的李敬齋才笑着舉了手，「預備總統」的妙案，宣吿完畢。</p>
<p>第七審委會第一國防外交小組，今晨突然拒絕記者旁聽，記者問「是不是開秘密會？如果是，我們就不推去。「憲兵老爺答：「不知道？反正不許你們進去。」「我們去問問那個職員好不好？」「不行，新聞記者誰也不許進這個門。」「那麼是誰的命令呢？排長？營長？處長？」「都不是，是『高頭』」到他們的「高頭」一問，原來是冷欣主席的悶頭命令，打聽一下討論內容，稀鬆平常，誰也說不來是「國防秘密」？「外交秘密」？</p>
<p>孔庚發火時，賴璉從教育文化小組會議席中走出來，站在樓廳裏參觀，他一邊笑，一邊搖頭，記者望望他，他趕緊回去開會。</p>
<p>國都問題下午於第一審委會提出前，全塲先熱烈鼓掌，一若好戲開塲前情形，而張溥老演說先後博得掌聲卅餘决，似梅蘭芳之壓軸戲。至主張北平與主張南京者之爭，渾似國劇中京派與海派唱對台戲，最後又殿以某女代表退席糾紛，幾鬧全武行，從頭到底，極似一幕「大會串」。</p>
<p>討論國都問題時，各代表滿口地理名詞。歷史教訓，與上午滿口「主權」「國權」完全異趣。某代表謂上午似上憲法課，下午又似上地理，歷史課。</p>
<p>張輯顏爲北派打衝鋒，悶齒流利，地名極熟，渠認國都若無問題，可不規定，旣有間題，非予明文規定不可。並謂，有人因經濟困難反對還都，其理由之不充足與因經濟困難，不主召開國大同樣不合理。</p>
<p>湘籍社會賢達仇鱉，不主建都長沙，而生建都西安。渠認爲全局打算，應選擇最壤最苦之地點，不應應在」，飲食男女」舒服，房十闊氣的南京或北平建都。</p>
<p>當國元老張溥老演說愈一刻鐘，渠首先表明「本人非賣弄聰明」。據謂，就余所知。建都南京非國父之主張，國父主建都南京爲一時的主張，而非永久主張·最後並沉痛指出，若再建都南京，非亡國不可，演說畢掌聲歷久不息。</p>
<p>重慶代表賴健君一口四川話，希望大勿志陪都家重慶。賴氏沉痛謂，重慶爲敵轟炸入年，始終未屈，陪都兩字是用血寫成的。</p>
<p>反駁建都南京之吳延環謂：「國父今日若仍在世，亦必主張建都北平。」全塲哄然大笑。渠反對因總理寢陵在南京，遂主建都南京。據稱，「中華民族之老祖宗爲黃帝，其寢陵遠在荒涼不堪之陝西中部縣，豈我人非建都中部不可乎？有謂遷都化綫其實到廬山避暑，其所化之錢亦不在少數。」</p>
<p>劉百閔唱壓軸戲，力主建都南京，其最精彩一語，爲今日爲十一日，後日即爲日人大屠殺南京之十三日，南京有多少同胞爲首都而死，南京爲首都係用血寫成。另一代表亦指出南京在抗戰期間，雖未能久守，然北平之失，在南京之先，不能因南京曾失守，而不主建都甫京。</p>

<h3>行總豫分署長報告　黃河堵口將完成　聯總代表稱泛濫區情形可怕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總河南分署署長馬傑，聯總代表魏斯特，及河南省建設應長宋彤，昨日下午在行總聯合招待記者，報吿黃泛區修復工程情形。首由爲氏報吿，略謂；黃河堵口工程即將完成，但堵口之最後目的，乃在恢復舊道，復興黃泛區，使該區人民均能安居樂業。馬氏並述目前行總所以急於趕修決口原因有三：（一）決口乃由於戰爭而造成，現戰事結束，難民自不應再使琉亡，應速使安定；（二）若此時再不趕修，則該區若干良田將不復能生產，成爲荒蕪之地；（三）黃河兩岸土地肥沃，適於耕種，如不加補救，該區糧食供應頗成問題，整理修竣以後，該區可供機器耕種之試驗地。但此項工作進行殊非易事，如兒童福利，交通衛生等問題，均難解決。</p>
<p>又據魏斯特氏稱：黃河泛濫區情形，至爲可怕，此種大泛濫，在世界歷史上僅於羅馬時代有之，而經二千年始治理畢事。美國ＴＶＡ之複雜情形，可與黃河相比，但其社會情形，自無中國之錯　。魏氏報吿黃泛區調查結果：該區共佔地一千六百五十萬畝，其中七百五十畝在河南境內，一且有九萬畝之地已滿長荒草，須一重加整理後始可耕種。同時據調一查，該區扶溝縣於一九三八年時一有人口三十二萬人，一年半前僅剩四萬四千人，其餘人口大都係逃亡失散或遭災殃而歿。目前則已增至十四萬人，均自各地歸鄉者，每週的五百人，但返鄉後仍無法解決衣食住問題。</p>
<p>最後由宋彤報吿河南省政府對此災情極爲關懷，特維織指導委員會，協助歸省居民進行各項事務，同時設法解決地權問題。該一會自經聯總行總救濟物資後，對於堆動工作已大見進步。</p>
<h3>董必武談話</h3>
<p>指救濟物資分配不公</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕董必武十一日晚就救濟物資之分配一事，對記者談稱：（一）救濟總署全國十五個分署，與共區有關者八個，人口佔百分之六十九，然其分配救濟物資則僅爲應得者百分之十，實不公平。聯總駐華辦事處前處畏雷氏，亦曾言此，比例爲一不好看之結論，蔣廷徽與雷氏曾擬改善未果，現新處長艾格頓亦擬改進，霍竇樹亦一再表示不應因黨派關係而有所歧視，但不公平之現象已成立。報載霍竇樹一聲明三點認爲其分配與共區物資之所以較少者因運來者多爲糧食，而共區爲產區，實不符事事實，如晉察區僅產黑豆，而湘贛區爲產糧軍，但仍有救濟物資之分配，故此事應慎黨處理。（二）聯總卅餘噸之重機器不必分與中共區，其實其中仍有若干輕機器，亦未分與。（三）黃河堵口事，共區已完成之工程，聯總已察看過，但因經費無着致險工無法做。</p>
<h3>棉衣薄且爛　如何可禦寒</h3>

<h3>美在哈設領　遭中共拒絕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十一日電〕中共發言人王炳南今日下午正式通知美大使館，謂奉延安命令，中共將拒絕美國所派之哈爾濱總個事克魯勃進入哈埠，以該地爲軍事區域。又稱：如在和平時期，或己允許克氏前往。叩以延安拒絕美領事入哈埠是否與中共平時指責美國援助政府一層有關？答稱：延安並未如此答覆。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕第國務院今日證實”中國共應黨會阻撥美政府在哈爾濱設立領事館之報吿。國務院發言人稱：美總領事克拉布會靜待共黨方面准其前往哈爾濱設立領館處八月之久，但因終於不獲共方准許，故目前仍在長春執行其領事職務。</p>
<h3>憲草中有關選舉諸問題</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>（三）婦女與僑胞</p>
<p>根據憲軍第一二九條之規定，「中華民國國民年滿廿歲者，有依法選舉之權，除本憲法及法律另有規定者外，年滿廿三歲者，有依法被選舉之權」。第二章第八條亦規定「中華民國人民無男女…之分，在法律上一律平等」。惟此次提案中，有關選舉問題，仍有若干與婦女有關者。</p>
<p>陳顧遠等六十二代表，主張於一百卅條「本憲法所規定各種選舉之候選人，一律公開競選」之下，加一但書：「但關於國民大會代表及立委監委之選舉，應以法律規定女子當選之最少名額。」其所持理由爲當今父系社會，男女公開競選，勝利必　男子，故我國歷來事例，皆規定女子當選之最少名額，以免男女平等之徒成虛名，英議會亦有對女子而設之條文。衛挺生等五十二代表所提第八十六案，主張於廿六條「國大以左列國民代表組織之」之下，增加「婦女團體選出之代表一款。認如此可使女子與男子競選時，不致吃虧，並謂「婦女問題，必須婦女始能解決」。</p>
<p>最近逝世之女代表劉純一氏。生前亦會與倪桂馥等卅三代表，提出於一百卅條後增補一本黨法所規定之各項人選，其婦女名額不得少於十分之三」，此則較陳顧遠等之提案更爲具體矣。至其何以規定爲十分之三以上，則原提案並朱說明</p>
<p>此次一百提案中，另一與選舉有關者爲：僑胞是否有選舉監察委員一問題。根據憲草廿六條一項二款及九十五條各款之規定，華僑無選舉監委之　，要求增補之提案計有陳樹人等所提四件，其理由有下列數者：（一）憲草六十五條規定立委名額之分配，旣列有僑居國外之國民一款，而監委名額之分配，則缺此一款，故主增加；（二）僑胞爽直敢言，長於彈劾監察之能事，（三）依據廿六條之規定，藍委與立委同具兩種齊格，即同時具有國大代表賽格，因之其產生方法應與其他立藍委各種代表一律由人民直接選舉方爲合理，而廿六條一項二條及九十六所規定之監委覺作例外，而定由議會間接選舉，似此性質不同而法互異，故主一律由人民眞接選舉。</p>
<p>除上述各問題外，提案中所涉及之選舉問題尚有（一）直接選舉問接選舉，（二）國大代表是否有權選舉總統副本總統以外其他重要官吏問題，（三）現任實職官吏在未解職獲准以前，可吾參加國大代表競選問題，（四）選舉人與被選舉人年齡問題，（五）直轄市選舉國大代表等問題，此等問題相信審查會中，皆將有熱烈討論。（完）</p>
<h3>河內又發生事故　華僑五人被擊斃　法越不斷衝突僑胞流離失所</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內十日電〕自河內至海防之鐵路及公路交通，自上月二十三日以來，即吿中斷，從未恢復，因此運輸問題，乃成爲目前最嚴重之間題矣·擬乘坐飛機視察之結果，獲悉公路在某某數點，均已被破壞，鐵路路軋，亦多毀壞，不堪應用，故河內與海了兩城之交通工具，唯有飛機一項而已，以致重貨，歐洲人民這食物，以及甫自法國運來之行李，均不有運輸。此外又悉，河內東北約十公里之處，今晚又發生事件，聞有華僑五人爲越南人所擊斃，因此在華僑與越南人民之間，又趨緊張。</p>
<p>〔中央社河內十日電〕海防法越軍衝突　視華方中立事，截至昨日止，據調查所得，華僑死傷及失踪被捕者八百餘人，財產損一失值越幣二千九百餘萬元，流離失所，傷心慘目，殺氣所播，蔓及河內各地。法方決以武力解決越局，而越方則堅持必須法軍回復十一月廿日以前在海防諒山原駐地區，然後談判，各走極端，厲兵秣馬，一觸即發。對於我方所要求劃分中立區，切實護僑等事，仍未見有具體辦法。</p>
<h3>戰時民營工廠損失　可獲院部賠償　工協得參加對日賠償委會</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕我國民營工廠戰時損失之賠償，及工業協會派代表參加對日賠償委會兩事·已獲當局之同意，正由中國全國工業協會及上海工業協會代表該會理事長吳蘊初·常務理事胡伯翔·金潤庠·及唐續之等四人，於十一日分別謁見行政院翁副院長文灝·及經濟部吳司長承洛·徐主任秘書百齊時所決定。翁副院長面許民營工廠在戰時之損失，可獲部院之賠償，而中國全國工業協會亦可派代表參加對日賠償委員會，以便於處理日本對我之賠償工作。翁氏並委託工業協會代爲收集全國民營工廠在戰時所損失之資料，供政府參考。又該四代表因鑒於請願目的已達，除吳氏仍留京參加國大外，餘均於明日返滬。</p>

<h3>明年度的市預算</h3>
<p>本市卅六年度預算歲入列二一〇，一九三，九八一，一二五元，歲出合計五二三，六七五，九一七，九九〇元，收支不敷達三一三，四八一，九三六，七七五元，這個虧空的數字，己覺駭人聽聞。據聞市府會商結果，實際收入數字，祇有一九〇，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，其中房捐，筵席捐等項並且還照現行的稅率估計，沒有把中央所規定的作爲標準。所以據最穩健的估計，據稱祗有一千一百億元的收入。那未，不敷的數字，竟在四千一百億元以上，超過實際的收入約三倍，超過市府商定的收入一倍有餘！</p>
<p>市府應付的辦法，是採量入爲出主義，就是按照本年下半年的預算，的略加一倍計算，總計的二一四，〇一七，四三三，四七〇元，再酌量緊縮，湊上一九〇八億的假想數字，其餘應行辦理的新增事項，另編一預算，另籌擬財源。就是說：有錢即辦，無錢不辦，有多少錢，辦多少事。據聞這項新財源的目標，大部份可能是公債。</p>
<p>語云：巧婦難爲無米之炊，實際上祇有這幾個錢，那麼，自然只能辦這幾件事。市府此次並不窮思極想，百方張羅款項，却很平實地維持現狀，堅持量入爲出主義，在大體上，很值得同情。</p>
<p>現在各地的財政，都鬧着虧空，其中的原因自然很多，很複雜，而百廢具舉，儘量點綴，多方地撐持塲面這一念，實在是造成虧空，擴大虧空的主因。所以然者，各機關的主管，爲責任心所驅使，對於職掌範園的事，本來多多益善，都抱着同時並舉的雄心，加上上糾機關的指示，長意機關的議決，和各方面的建議，不能不分頭應付，兼程並進，所以財政上的重要因素，反退居於决要的地位。爲挽回這個風氣，和彌補預算的短缺起見，除掉由各部會或各地方的最高長官因時因地，權衡輕重，予以統盤籌劃外，竟沒有其他的辦法。即如這次滬市歲入，限定爲一九〇八億，而維持現狀的歲出，却須二一四〇億。在數字上看來，似乎收支依舊不敷。其實各單位當初所造的預算，（卅五年下半年度）本來不很切實。原來在編製歲出和施政計劃的時候，巴不得多辦幾椿事，多要幾個錢，等到預算案確定了，却又因種種關係，預　的工作無法展開，以至許多款項，凍結在庫，無從請支。昨據一位幕中人見吿，某機關事業費沒有動支的，達三分之一。這話如果可靠，那末，把本年下半年度的費用加一倍，即作爲明年度的歲出預算，也還須切實地打一折扣。因爲表面上這雖是維持現狀，實際還帶着幾分理想也。</p>
<p>房捐，筵席捐等，最近立法院己經分別議決，其稅率遠比本市現行的爲低。在這市財政大鬧虧空的時候，我們如果說：該照中央稅率征收，好像有點和市財政當局開玩笑，太不近人情。其實這是法治精神所繫，不是幾個錢的問題。假如依法減征以後，確實不够開文，我們的理想是：寗可另籌其他合法的新財源來抵補，不願意明目張胆地弁髦中央的法律，</p>
<p>我們還得承認：這幾個錢的出入，並不足以過分地影響市預算，將來影響市預算最厲害的是物價，不是一部份減征的捐稅。假如明年物價，依舊直錢上漲，公務員的待遇，每三個月，仍須照例調整一次，而各項工料，購置，修理等費，又必須隨時增加，那末，原定百分五的預備費，和三百六十億的調整生活補助費，恐怕還是無濟於事。</p>
<p>所以在承平時候，預算上的數字？確乎值得重視。在這個經濟上的非常時候，與其錙銖必較地謀所收支數目的相等，倒不如穩定物價，解決工商業的危機來得切實。我們打開本市的歲入表來看，營業稅，牌照稅，碼頭捐之類，固然與市面的盛衰，關係其密，便是其他屠宰稅，筵席及娛樂稅，族棧捐，一切規費，公有營業收入，房捐及公用事業附征的建設捐等等，也何一不與市面同其休戚？所以本市明年度的預算，其準確性不在於目前估計之數字，而在於物價及市面的變遷。</p>
<h3>澀谷事件判決不當　我代表提出異議　對日警責任應進行調查</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十日電〕澀谷事件中被捕之我合胞卅六人，經二月又半之鞠後，已於今日下午宣判，其中二人經判無罪開釋，一人被判服苦役三年，其他卅三人被判服苦役二年。被判有罪之臺胞，將被驅逐出境，在盟軍佔領期間不准重返日本。與其他美法官二人共同組成三人委員會負責審鞠澀谷案之國際法庭我國委員裘君，於宣判後，立即提出異議，裘氏力稱：「檢察處在超出合理懷疑之外，不能證明各被吿有罪，本委員會值可作一決定，即駁回原吿之訴，將各被吿宣判無罪」。裘氏之異議，立即引起判決是否確當之問題，蓋以三人委員會僅得三分之二票決定各被告有罪也。聞我代表團長朱世明將軍，及沈觀鼎，將訪晤美方艾其森，就澀谷案宣判事提出討論。沈氏更將就七月十九日射擊事件中有關日警察責任一點，提出，各被各始終不承認引起該項臺胞六人喪命及廿餘人受傷事件之首先放槍之責任。日警出庭作證時，把所耗於該决事件中之槍彈，達五百四十二發之多。據三人委會主委宣稱：該案將交由佔領當局審核，我駐日代表團於澀谷事件發生後，一向堅持進行完全及公正之調查，我代表　之不斷努力，欲使台胞受公正審物，並使發生摩擦之兩造責任，得以追究明白，但關查日警責任一事，迄今猶未完成。</p>

<h3>一警士投函鳴委屈</h3>
<p>第一函　我們都是站在光生門前或樓下的警察，我們的家人，都爲着所得的薪津微薄而在　寒着，在疾病着，……而我們呢？在寒風冷雨中，在冰天雪地上，在酷熱的太陽下，拼命的奔馳，忍耐地站着自己的崗位，所爲的是什麼，有了火警，有了盜匪，我們耕命的搏鬥，逮捕……所爲的是什麽？有少數陰謀者，想藉着這次攤販事件而製成慘案，我們用自己的生命去維護着八民的利益，所爲的又是什麼？</p>
<p>我們固然不敢稱功，說我們已經盡了我們的責任，而我們讓家人在挨苦在怨艾，我們自己在忍耐在拼命，實在是因爲要使自己負起一部份國民的責任，來保獲社會地方的安寗，所以雖然苦一點，精神上亦覺得稍爲安慰。</p>
<p>但有人說：「警察應是服務人民，而不應有管理人民的心理。」難道我們這就不是服務人民而是管理人民了嗎？難道我們應該服務於不良份子或少數人，由他們不顧一切的搗亂或妨書了大多數人的利益或安寗嗎？</p>
<p>我們爲淸大多數人的利益而流血，……試問那個同情了焦頭爛額的我們呢？不特沒有同情·撫慰·反而遭受了部份人士由不理解而至的謗罵？</p>
<p>先生們！試設身處地想想我們將會如何的憤恨，如何的難　所以我們要呼籲，我們要悲鳴，因爲我們受了屈辱？因爲我們受了不合理的批評，呼籲，悲鳴　要求賢明的先生們給予一點公平的慰籍！（高橋警察分局一個長警代表）</p>
<p>第二函我是一個警察，又是貴報每日必讀忠厚的讀者，在十一月份貴報登載公教人員加薪的好消息，照原薪加三倍，現在我仍舊每月只拿到十萬一千五百元。公正的先生們；我們非但未加餉，通每月應發的五斗黃糙米（十月十一月份）還未發給我們，在物價在漲的現在，十萬元的待遇，怎樣叫警察們能修維持生活呢？再公教大員配售軍毯，非但不配售而且信息全無，不知當局在計劃什麼呢？配售配給是很好聽的要爾登呢，每套須十二三萬元，請公正先生們想想，假使我們買一套的話，至少一個月不吃飯還不夥，假使真有便宜貨配售，我們那有多餘的錢去買呢？警察們是人民的公僕，保獲人民生命財產安居樂業，但是我們這樣的生話，公正先生們；給警察們一個同情啊！（李耀祥）</p>
<h3>公務員乘車應優待</h3>
<p>本年九月間，市參議會會議及公教人員免費乘軍一案，時至今日猶未實施，公教人員待遇非薄，盡人皆知，無待　述，每日上下班單靠一二輛交通車，限於時間，限於路綫，要使散居四處的公務員，都接送無遺，絕難辦到，故能享受乘坐是項交通車者，爲數極微，大多數皆自乘電車或公共汽車。在車票昂漲的今日，此一問題，每一公務員，都感到嚴重，所幸英法商電車公司都有優待公教人員乘車辦法，出售月季票，每張一萬元，使窮苦的公教人員，着實受憲不淺，但是電車路綫不能達到的地方，必須乘坐公用局公共汽車，公共車旣屬市營，照理應更優待，可是事實完全相反，市府暨所屬各局職員乘車時，一律須照章買票，絲毫不能短少，而對於同業外商電車公司員工乘車，在互惠條件下，則無　而購票‘公務員固應絕對守法，乘車當然要買票，惟目前物價在漲不已，月入僅十餘萬元，仰事俯畜，責在一身之環境下，車費之支出幾佔全部收入三分之一，如何能負担？公共汽車與外商電軍組織及性質迥不相同，更應盡可能爲公教人員謀取福利，我們不再痴心妄想參議會免費乘車的實施，祗要求公用局迅飭公共汽車公司自一月份起，援電車公司例，發售公教人員乘坐公共汽車月季票，即受賜多多！（小公務員）</p>

<h3>柯孚海峽英艦觸雷事　英致阿國最後通牒　要求道歉保證不再有同樣事件發生　兩週內無滿意答覆將向安理會申訴</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕此間今夜發表：英政府爲英艦在柯孚海峽無故被襲，因而發生生命及財產損失事，已向阿爾巴尼亞政府提出指辭強硬之最後通牒，限其於十四天內正式向英道歡，並要求賠償損害。如不獲滿意答覆，英政府將向安理會提出該事。首决事件發生在五月十五日英巡艦「奧里翁」號及超等號於經過海峽時爲阿國海岸砲台發砲射擊，幸未受損。迨至十月廿二日英驅逐艦「蘇馬萊土」號及「伏拉傑」號又在海峽觸水雷受重傷，官兵死者四十四人之多。在兩次事件之間，商輪經過該地亦時被射擊，英政府照會指出英掃雷艦於十一月間在該處掃除水雷，發見此等水雷實係英驅遂艦出事前不久始敷者。由　國海岸戒備嚴密一點觀，若在海峽黨設水雷，決無不爲阿國當局所知之理，故英政府訊爲此等水雷，或係阿國所自敷設，或則阿政府必知有數設之事。因此，阿爾巴尼亞政府實已嚴重破壞國際公法。英政府茲特要求阿國政府，爲英艦先後被襲事，正式向英政府道歉，並保證不再發生同樣事件。英政府復要求阿國政府賠償英艦於十月廿二日所受之損失，並向死亡官兵四十四名之家屬支付全部撫卹金。阿政府若不於照會送達之日起十四天內提出滿意答覆，英政府將視阿國此項行爲，爲對於國際和平與安全之嚴重威脅，而向安理會提起吿訴。該照會係於昨日遞交貝爾格勒之阿國公使館者。</p>

<h3>聯總舉行全體大會　重視今後救濟工作　賴迦第亞爲聯總工作辯護　謂分配糧食從未牽涉政治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕聯總歐洲部份本月底結束，建東部份明年三月底結束，聯總四十八國代表今日在此舉行全體會議，署長賴迦第亞竭力爲聯總分配食物事辯護，謂凡以聯總分配糧食時曾施用政治手段爲言者，絕非正確之論。余絕不知糧食分配時曾經牽涉政治一項。賴民追述聯總一切糧食之運送均係由九國管理委員會決定，據稱，余未聞任何政府因糧食分配牽涉政治而表示反對。賴氏此項聲明，係答復副國務卿艾克遜星期日之聲明，艾氏曾謂若干國家獲得接濟太多，若干國家則太少，此乃重大錯誤一云。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕聯總署長賴迦第亞，本日向聯總理事會第六屆會議撥出一九四六年第三季聯總工作之報吿，據稱迄十一月十八日爲止，聯總之工作計劃已完成百分之七十二。同時聯總運出之救濟物資前後總計約一七，八四五，〇〇〇長噸（一八，一三〇，五二〇公噸）共值二，一一七，六五三，〇〇〇美元。目下主要之問題爲聯總本年十二月三十一日對歐洲救濟及明年三月三十一日對中國教濟正式結束後之繼續計劃。</p>
<h3>調查各國軍隊案　聯大會一塲爭辯　裁軍問題商定九項原則　小組會起草報告書交大會討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕英國代表無克魯斯今日在聯合國全體大會中，促　蘇聯外長莫洛托夫贊成對於國外以及國內軍隊之調查計劃，謂吾人不妨聽任事實公開，掀起帳幕，觀看全世界各國之究竟，藉以祛除猜疑。余要求蘇聯勿進循孤立政策，造成猜疑。簫氏並稱，莫洛托夫實反對其自身之提議。按政治委會以卅四票對七票通過軍隊調查案時，蘇聯曾表示異議，謂調查國內軍隊人數問題僅與普遍裁軍案有關。　先是，，美國代表康納利亦稱，一吾人並無秘密，吾人當以全部兵一力向世界公開，希望他國亦能如一此，但康氏重行聲明反對英國提案由安理會派遣調查團，實地覆核駐軍人數之報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕聯合國大會今日繼績討論調查各國軍隊間題，蘇聯代表同意由國際機構負責調直各國軍隊惟建設必須同時調查各國軍備，包括原子彈在內，即將調查軍隊與調查軍備併爲一案。英代表「原則上」已贊成蘇聯所提辦法，如此議得獲大會通過，則美國勢必將其原子彈秘密即行付諸公開。目前主要爭執點仍爲否決權問題。英代表堅持負責調查各國軍隊及軍備之國際機構，應不受安理會中否決權之約束，蘇代表主張則與此相反。大會主席史巴克宣稱，如此議經大會通過，則調查各國軍隊及軍備之整個機構至明年一另十五日即可成立。</p>

<h3>伊朗政府軍深入亞省　攻佔米安納要城　英重甲不干涉伊內政</h3>
<p>〔合眾社德黑蘭十一日電〕據值開入亞塞爾拜然省監視選舉之政府軍隊，已佔領米安納，據來自該城在首府大不列士西南，距大不列士使二百公里。亞省前綫之電訊稱：政府軍與亞省民主軍嚴發生劇戰以後，已佔領米安納之消息，可能認爲確實。倘該城已被佔領，即政府軍已前進三十哩之謂。該電訊又稱，蘇駐伊朗大使沙契科夫對伊朗政府之軍事行動，向總理蘇丹納提出強硬抗議，指賣伊朗政府違背諾言，派遣軍隊入亞省，足以威脅蘇聯邊境。據稱伊朗總理不斷受蘇方之監力，欲其停止軍事行動。國會選舉頃巳在伊朗其他各處開始進行，但亞省一地之選舉將俟政府軍力能控制投票時，然後舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕英外交部發言人重申前言，聲明伊朋軍隊在其本國境內調動，純屬伊朗政府之內部事件。該發言人否認外傳伊中央政府派兵入亞省，係由英方供獻意見之說·記者復　以若亞省戰爭爆發，英政府是否仍認此乃內部事件？答曰，英政府當然認伊朗境內之動亂，應由伊政府解決。</p>

<h3>埃新閣困難重重　社會部長拒不就職　開羅治安不靖情形緊張　英埃談判前途難以樂觀</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十日電〕此問最近投擲炸彈及縱火等情事層出不窮，當局爲此，特於本日命令警察局，凡有任何形跡可疑之人，徘徊公共塲所，部長及高級官員官邸之前，均可開槍，格殺不論。此外又悉：諾克拉奇內閣總理領導組織之新內閣，因新任社會部長亞羅巴堅決拒絕接受部長之職，故本日未能在國王法魯克面前，宣誓就職。據亞羅巳談一人徵詢余之意見，故不能予以接受，余在前內閣常拒絕與英國簽訂協定，現仍堅持此種意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十日電〕負賣政治觀察家稱：就埃新總理諾克拉奇之就職演說觀之，英埃兩國對於蘇丹未來地位意貝之不同，勢將繼續存在。諾克拉奇曾謂其內閣將領導蘇丹人建立自治政府，並永遠在埃王治下與埃統一。此問人士認爲此乃對於貝文—薛特基所議英埃草的蘇丹部份之正式解釋。然不允蘇丹人有獨立，而使某永選與埃及合併之觀念，已先後經蘇丹總督赫特爾斯登及倫教外交部加以拒絕。英政府旣無放棄其立塲之趨勞，故料貝文—薛特基協定恐難作爲英埃修約談判之基礎。</p>

<h3>對日索取賠償計劃　美否認決定减少　日即將宣佈五年經濟計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日專電〕美國務院人員今日否認外間所傳美國要求日本賠償數量之最後計劃，較鮑萊所建機要求於日本工業者爲少。據稱：賠償討劃迄仍在預備階段，目前尚未有最後決定，較鮑萊計劃或多或少，尚不可知。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕　　日日人方面消息，關於定期在日會報吿鮑萊所提之日本賠　計劃一事，已無限期予以延期，籍以進免引起國際聞反響。據稱：日本政府誠恐因此使各國認爲日本已擬於賠償條件正將宣佈時，要求予以減輕。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十一日電〕據此間消息靈通人士稱：日政府即將公布一九四五至一九五〇年度之經濟建設五年計劃，該項計劃將以煤斤與水電發電之生憲爲很據，規定在一九五〇年出產煤斤三百五十萬噸，即等於一九三七年度之百分之八十。日本各界領袖深信日本之前途醫於工業與對外貿易，而不在於民主。目前之重大問題爲賠償計劃，鮑萊之賠償計劃，給予日本經濟前途以淸楚的概念。</p>

<h3>美艦隊司令　論未來戰爭　北極固屬重要　海岸亦應重視</h3>
<p>〔聯台社紐約十日電〕太平洋登陸戰專家第四艦隊司令巴培中將今日暢論未來戰爭之趨勢。據稱，美國將來倘遭大規模破壞武器之襲擊，數小時內或將死傷五百萬人。但敵人不能一下將我擊倒。數小時內，吾國將實施大規模之報復攻擊。美國對於大規模破壞武器之製造，至少較他國進步十年，但吾人必須買進不已。軍事上之進步，乃爲聯合國成功幕後最有力之保障，他日一旦戰爭倘再發作，絕非君子間的决鬥，而爲文明大眾之存在問題。一般人重視穿越北極前來之攻擊，下知理由何在，余以爲外國自數百哩外大西洋散處地點派遣十餘艘潛艇及原子彈至美國東海岸各城市，更有可能。火箭式之原子彈，甚至於潛艇沉沒後，仍能發射，但吾人之報復亦將敏捷，敵人無法避免，且受更大損失。</p>
<h3>中國與印度（中）</h3>
<p>— （尼赫魯著）</p>
<p>本報駐印記者　周祥光譯</p>
<p>玄奘吿訴我們很多那蘭陀大學的情形，其他紀載亦同前幾年我曾到過那蘭陀大學，見廣多遺物從遺址中有計劃的掘出來，引爲驚異今日僅有一小部份向無發掘出來，仍然是人民居留之地，但這些地方，依然包括着廣大庭園，被石製而成的莊嚴屋宇圍繞着。</p>
<p>當玄壯在中國圓寂後不久另一旅行者義淨和尚來到印度。他在公元六七一年從中國啓程，途中足足走了兩年，始到達印度的德拉立的港口，就是胡格里河的口上。因他由海路而來，並停在巴鄰旁（在蘇門答臘），研究楚文若干時月。這决海路的航行，他是具有深意的，或許由於政治局面的變動，而使中亞細亞的情狀不靖以致不能由陸路而來，若干佛教的僧舍，在途中各處，爲彼輩止步安息之所。海路或亦更能適合印度在印尼殖民地之增長，並且使印度與其他國家發生經常商業關係。從義淨及他人之紀載上表明，當此之時，在伊朗，印度，馬來亞。蘇鬥答臘與中國間，有經常航行，義凈即是乘波斯船，由廣東而初决到了蘇門答臘。</p>
<p>義凈亦曾在那蘭陀大學研究，爲時甚久，並且帶回去數千百卷之梵文經典。他的主要興趣在於佛教禮儀及規儀方面之要點，且他曾紀載這些事情非常詳盡，他復吿訴我們關於衣，食及習慣方面亦多·北印度方面之主要食品爲麥，如現在一樣，東用印度以食米爲主，肉類雖有時食之，但亦鮮見。琪油牛奶等物，則隨處可以見之，而餅干水菓等則甚多。義爭紀載着印人極重要之事，是依恃於某一種特定之宗教禮儀的淸淨「現在第一件最重要的分別，在五印度及其他國家間，就是宗教禮儀之眞誠奉行與吾。而且：「食物遺留下來，若在中國可以貯藏此却未必與印度律例相符」。</p>
<p>義淨曾談到印度。謂爲西方，但他自己吿訴我們，印度是名爲Aryadesha　Arya之意義爲爭。Desha之義土，爲爭土一各爲西方。其所以如此稱謂者，因其人之性格表現，都是尊貴淸爭，並且所有民人亦以此名而贊揚斯土。印度又名爲中土」Madhyadesha因共地處百教國家之中央。一切人民對於此名倍覺親近。北方夷族（如胡，蒙古人，突厥人）獨日呌凈土爲印度，但此畢竟不是一個普通名詞。這不過當地沿用之名，並無特殊之意義·印度人民並不知道這個名稱，對於印度最適當之名稱，則是「淨土」。</p>
<p>義凈的論到身毒，是非常有趣的。他曾說：「有些人說，印度Indu之義爲月，中國人呌India爲印度，係從此而來，雖然其義或許如此，但這非普通之名。抑若印人稱中國爲支那，道不過祇是名稱，並無特別意義」。他亦述到梵文對於高麗及其他國家所稱之名。</p>
<p>義凈對於印度至爲崇敬，並對印度之事物亦物亦然，他對於此類事情紀述詳盡，並首先給予其母國—中華。印度或係「淨土」，中國却是神州」。「五印度之人民對於自己之真誠與尊貴，頗爲自負。但祟尚思想文字涵養，雍容正態度，平中氣概，迎送禮儀，食物調羹之有味，仁慈公正之胸懷，則祇能在中國始得之，他國則吾」。針炙術之醫治及按脈感覺之巧妙，如印度任何地方所不能取而代之，藥劑之延續生命，亦祇能在中國見之…從人之性格與物之質言之中國名爲神州·在五印度中之任何一印度，能不崇敬中國乎」？</p>
<p>古代梵文對於中國帝王之稱謂爲Deva—Putra，俱確之譯義爲「天子」。</p>
<p>義淨本人就是一個梵文學者，他稱譽梵文，并且他亦說過在南北之較遠的國家，亦祟敬此種語文：更有若干神州（中國）與天堂（印度）的人們，教授這一語文的典則：梵文學者之在中國，必定普遍已極。我們覺到有趣的，有若干中國學者，想將梵文的音符用到中國語文裏去。一個最好的例子，就是中國唐朝儈人漱文，想將中國語文，按照此種方向，成爲字母拼音式。印度佛教寰微，中雖常有朝山者從中國來參訪印度的佛教聖地，但實際兩國學者之交往，已吿斷絕。當公元十一世紀間，政治革命之進行，所有佛教僧徒皆携梱經典，走向尼泊爾，或越喜馬拉雅山而至西藏。古代印度文舉之重要部份，我們先前已知道到了中國與西藏，近年來已經在那邊原本元全發現，譯本亦屬頗多。好多印度古經典，不但有關於佛教者，而且，有關於婆羅門教，天文，算學，醫慶者，仍保留於中文及藏文關於這種學者聯係之事，迄今仍存，最好例子，就是梵文，藏文及中文之佛教術語辭典。此書作於公元第九或第十世紀間，各曰大辭書Mahavyutpatti。</p>

<h3>陸京士召集紡織工人代表　商談年賞分配問題　勞方表示讓步希望仍依照往年辦法　社會局將召集工商領袖舉行談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會部組訓司司長陸京士，昨日下午會的集棉紡織業工人代表，假社會局會議室就年賞問題交換意見。陸司長吿記者：工人方面以棉紡織業利潤甚甚厚，希望能有六個月薪　之年賞；但貨方則認爲紗價已受限制，利得有限，几賬面上雖廉錢，如以物資計算，並未增加，不能接受勞方之要求。勞方經其勸吿後，已願作相當讓步，但最低希望仿照往年之辦法，將工人年賞分成全年所得百分之二十，二十五，三十三等，組工得百分之二十，管理人員得百分之三十。所謂全年所得，乃指扣去假日後之實際收人。本人相信棉紡織業勞資雙方之間，必能和衷共濟，在維持生產保護勞工之原則下，對此問題獲得協議。又據勞方人士表示：昨日之會議爲非正式交換意見，勞方巳將其觀點儘量提出，以供參考。陸氏明日即返京，定本月二十一日再來滬，屆時棉紡織業之年賞間題，當可有具體之快定。</p>

<h3>巡邏視察禁建區　婉言勸告拆棚屋　五處空地百餘畝準棚戶租用</h3>

<p>同時工務局趙局長昨日上午特價營造處處長王元康親白至長壽路，西康路，餘姚路，宜昌路及江寗路等處視察。該廠以餘姚路（即舊新加坡路）建屋者最多，中區棚戶多數係造在馬路內或弄內。趙局長今日仍將親往楊樹浦區視察。記者昨特走訪趙局長，詢渠關於處理棚戶辦法，承吿目前禁建區內尚未完工之棚戶決予取締，今其至非禁建區內蓋搭。同時根據都市計劇，業經市府核准轉飭地政局微購建造平民村之私地五處，共計一百六十三畝，計有：楊樹浦飛虹路二一畝，蒲淞區曹家渡四五畝，滬南區天鑰橋四〇·八畝，浦東楊家波一五·六畝，滬南區肇局路四〇·八畝。該項土地原擬列入明年預算中備建造平民村。但在經費無着前，空地可准棚戶擇地租用。</p>
<p>該局前在南市大木橋建造之平民村一百餘幢，現除由少數市民租住外，餘皆爲市府職員住用。又據趙局長表示如欲配合都市計劃，房屋建築必須區劃。工廠附近希望設建宿舍，則房荒間題即可減輕多少。住宅，商業各區亦常劃分。趙局長昨並視察本市瓶頸形凸出房屋，對於此項問題，將於下决市政會議內付之公議。</p>

<h3>孟姜女演出美滿　蔣夫人茶會招待贊助人　梅蘭芳批評演技　費希盛讚劇情好</h3>
<p>蔣夫人宋美齡女士，昨日下午五時，假勵志社第二招待所舉行茶會，爲籌募國民革命軍遺族母校復校基金，招待孟姜女歌劇公演上海贊助人。到外賓費希及吳市長夫婦，方治，徐寄慶，吳紹對，宣鐵吾，黃仁霖，魏景蒙，奚玉書，丁貴堂，劉攻芸，徐學禹，曹俊，梅蘭芳，王泊生，鄧士萍，郭琳爽劉靖基，章榮初，沈德爕，王兆槐，章楚等二十餘人。時值大雨滂沱，夫人準時蒞會，與來賓一一握手寒暄，情緒至爲愉快。賓主略進茶點後，夫人首向梅蘭芳博士，及國立戲劇學校校長王泊生分別徵詢對孟美女歌劇內容之批評·二氏認爲除表演技術上尚需略事改進外，劇情方面含義甚深，頗能表現中國文化之一部分。</p>
<p>繼總幹事黃仁霖報告略謂，此决孟姜女歌劇在滬公演，承各界熱心勸募，業爲感謝。就連日公演之情形觀察，全部收入可能達到四億之數，各位贊期人中，特別是杜月笙，錢新之，徐寄康三位先生協助最多。梅蘭芳，王泊生二位先生指導最動，才能獲得如此成績，誠屬機會難得。十日夜場已告滿座，本定十一日晚閉幕，爲滿足觀眾興趣起見，特在十二日加演一天，並將日塲票價減爲二千，四千，夜塲票價減爲五千，一萬，以便普通市民均能觀賞。黃氏報告畢，蔣夫人致詞</p>
<p>蔣夫人繼起致詞稱，孟姜女歌劇在滬公演成續很好，本人不但代表遺族學校對諸位爲我們的遺族子弟壽募教育基金，表示感謝，同時對於中國的文化能藉孟姜女歌劇，向國外介紹，增進國際間了解之機會，望覺意義深長，衷心至感快慰。孟姜女歌劇上演後，本人曾與委員長觀演四次，覺該劇內容，比一般舊劇，改良甚多。馬歇爾將軍對該劇亦感興趣，常常談起，足證該劇如往國外公演，亦可吸引不少觀眾。</p>
<p>贊助人意見旋由各贊助人一一申述對改良該劇之意見，歸納可得下列數點：（一）音樂須與動作配合，（二）扮演孟美女之主角，年紀嫌老，（三）神鬼混雜一起，動作零亂，（四）化裝要改良，以辨善惡。最後夫人向外賓費希徵詢意見，渠謂，劇情很好，希望能到美國華盛頓，紐約各地公演。夫人表示贊同，旋由黃總幹事作結語謂，各位如此熱心贊助，不但在文化工作上，有了很大的供獻，間時對於遺族學校的特來，也奠定了基礎，謹向各位表示極大的謝意。賓主暢談至六時許，始盡歡而散。夫人於散會後，由黃仁霖陪同，在招待所內各塲）巡視一週，始乘車返東平路官邸休息。晚八時三十分，夫人復往南京大戲院觀演孟姜女，興趣甚濱，終塔始返。</p>
<h3>劇團負責人表示出國時將減人數</h3>
<p>又據中靑音樂劇團總經理鄧士萍語記者，該劇自十一月六日起曾在京勵志社公演九日，觀眾甚多，票價分一萬，五萬二種，收入共一億餘元，十二月五日起來滬公演，票價分一萬，二萬，五萬三種。全部收入，俟演完後始可結算。成績大致不差。惟劇情內容及表演技術上缺點尚多，希望社會人士多予指導贊助。本團無不衷誠接受，切實改良。記者詢以全部演員人數共有若干，渠謂演員計三十五人，運劇務在內共的六十人左右。將來如出國公演，仍當盡量設迭減少。</p>

<h3>玉佛寺內會晤太虛　佛門戒殺法師黯然</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕寒雨中，梵唄起處，玉佛寺更見得靜蕭而莊嚴了，</p>
<p>松月師引我們走過了一條走廊，在大雄寶殿的後側面，一座靜靜的　堂前停下。他搶前走了一步，笑着吿訴我們：</p>
<p>「這位是太廠老法師」。</p>
<p>太虛老法師穿着綜黃色的佾衣，白絨襯衣的袖口伸出在袖口外面。戴上一頂絨線帽子，也是深綜色的。玳瑁開邊的眼鏡後而是一對慈祥而愉快的眼睛，含笑看着我們。他伸出了豐腴而修潔的手，歡然一握。我們在舒適的沙發上坐了下來。松月師坐在旁邊的椅子上靜靜聽着。</p>
<p>佛們戒殺，而當前正將有大規模自相殘殺的戰爭進行，當然就不期而然的談到了時局了。老法師似乎躊躇了一下，慢慢地說，「國民黨自廿六年以來，終於抗戰勝利，共實，應當是可以全國休養生息，安定一下了，誰知道——偏偏的協商又是得不到成果，弄到這樣田地！」</p>
<p>老法師俯下了頭，不禁點然。</p>
<p>佛教徒組黨</p>
<p>我們換了一個話題：「最近又盛傳佛教徒組黨的說法，大法師的看法是怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>『我在覺羣週報第一期會談過這個問題·中山洗生說，政權是全國人民的，儈侶常然也是人民，應當願問政事。我們可以參加選舉，到參議會，省議會，或者國民代表大會——不過組黨的事，我倒不大這樣主張。」</p>
<p>太虛法師對佛教教育，一向是非常關心的，在重慶，他會主持了規模開大的海藏教理院，對邊疆一帶，起了相常大的作用。</p>
<p>談到西藏的佛教，我不免就想起了密宗，因爲諾那活佛在上海的種種奇跡實在太奇怪了。法師說：密宗的確是有些奇怪，不過倒的確是大乘。有些奇怪的事情可以說是「術」，不過海藏教理院所研究的是「教義」，是「學」。</p>
<p>靜安寺事件</p>
<p>晨後，我們談起了大家很注意的靜安寺事件。</p>
<p>太廬法師搔了搔頭，已經滿頭都是銀絲了。他堅決地說：</p>
<p>「我看這件事包括兩個部份。第一個部份就是德悟密迦兩個人被檢舉爲漢奸的事情。老實說，這兩個人要算漢奸嗎，却實在還有些不够。要照這樣在敵偽時期參加過一兩次人民團體的就算是漢奸的話，恐怕淪陷區裏還有四五百萬人該被檢舉了。第二個部份是靜安寺和寺裏的一點產業，該怎樣管理的問題。我覺得以前寺院裏的管理制度，到了現代，已經不大適宜了。我在重慶辦的海藏教理院，以前本來是一座荒廟，因爲廟裏管理不善，破壞得很利書，後來教理院辦起來，成立董事會管理廟產，另請專人負責院務，便得到了成績。我以爲靜安寺的寺產，也可以組織一個董事會來管理，另外在寺地辦醫院，或者圖書館，或表學校，另請專人負責管理行政上的事務——可以辦作由佛教所辦的一種業務。這倒恐怕是比較妥善的辦法。</p>
<p>論六根和尚</p>
<p>靜安寺現在是由六根負責的，但法師顯然認爲目前的辦法並非根本解決。他說：「將來德悟他們回來，一定還會有糾紛。六根是一個朽庸無能的人，民初他也主特滿靜安寺，可是他來之後就從來沒有辦好過，訟累始終未休。所以根木上管理的辦法，要謀所以改進了。」</p>
<p>法師今年以經五十八歲了，近年來因爲血壓國高，所以文章也不能多寫，話也不能多說。不久，也許要到寗波去一次。明年在南京開的全國佛教會，也是法師主持的。</p>
<p>離開玉佛寺時，幕色在雨絲中已十分蒼茫了。</p>
<p>會見記者時之太盧法師（本報陸順興攝）</p>
<h3>薈萃各地代表舉行一週會議　基督教大會昨圓滿閉幕</h3>

<h3>煤斤供應已改善　來源積極疏通中　安南白煤將有六千噸運到</h3>
<p>據經濟部上海區燃料管委會負責人稱：爲防止本市煤斤黑市起見，自本月份對工廠配煤方法加以改善，即前按月各工廠需要數量，皆由煤業公會代會員申謂，現改爲由工廠直接將實際需要量具單申請，由該會審核後配給，一方可以配合工廠需要加緊生產，另一方則避免公會從中操縱，再則可使黑市價格自然趨降。白煤方面，預訐十五日可能由安南運到六千噸，又據有把握方面前向安南古拔煤礦廠洽定相富數量，如無意外波折，每月可有六千噸運華，月底可先到一批。塊煤方面，戰後各國缺貨，商人自由採購爲數工多，該會前已向美國洽購一萬噸，如該地船員風潮平息，即可運到。至分配方法，當另訂之。</p>
<p>解除煤荒　端賴開源</p>
<p>該負責人繼稱：爲解救目前煤球原料困難計，除保特經常供給原料外，木月份再加添白煤小塊二千噸交煤球業公會補充原料，關於消除一般黑市問題，仍盼地方政府盡力協助。該負責人末稱：解除煤荒，端賴開源，其中最主要者爲交通問題，按照過去三月至九月各處到貨，均臻理想，十月及十一月份則成績欠佳，在能力範圍之內，當儘量設法加強。除開　方面每月維持十四五萬噸，台灣五萬餘噸，分配谷地交通水電機構，及工廠等，現資委會對於煤斤生產異常注意，預計明年度東北可生產五百萬噸，并可以五分之一運供關內，一俟明春葫蘆島解涷，即可開始。至每日能出產白煤一千噸之焦作煤礦，已經國軍克復，積極生產，該地存煤的十四萬噸，惜自焦作至新鄉，鐵路未及修復，又以道路漫長，火車運輸困難，現已設法向聯總行總當局商妥，俟由產地運到新鄉後，改由卡車陸續運出。</p>

<h3>有關各方面將舉行會議　庫長失蹤增加偵查困難</h3>
<p>昨據有關方面消息：各有關機一關特派來滬調查木案之人員，可能於日內舉行一會議，互相交換意見，中央社記者昨爲此案特訪負責調查本案之某氏，據談：本案起火眞相，確切原因，迄今未明，蓋並無一人目擊當時肇事情形，雖據最後逃出之庫丁供稱，係因庫內手榴彈連續爆發而致起火，僅係根據爆炸聲響而判斷，失事情形，亦不能完全明瞭，加之分庫長王仁珊，主管庫員吳汝鏕之失踪，使本案徒增偵查上之困難，內據當時情形判斷，王仁珊等似不致於罹難，若果顯屬畏罪潛逃，如王等能挺身投案，　明常日搬運情形，當可增加調查上綫索云云。總之本案之肇事眞相，現仍繼統嚴查，以期大白。</p>

<h3>八一三戰前失蹤案醜劇主角　宮崎貞夫在日本出現　在國內經過了十年監禁才復自由</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕最近日本傳來的消息，說是宮崎貞夫這個人又出現了。</p>
<p>宮崎處夫是誰呢？</p>
<p>民國二十六年七月二十四口，那時正是七七事變發生後十七大，離八二二還有九天，上海正是空氣最擊張的時候。突然，在那天晚上十點鐘，有兩個日本軍官到狄司威路捕房報吿，說是當夜日本陸戰隊歸隊點名時，少了一個一等兵，這一等兵的名字呌做宮崎貞夫。</p>
<p>日軍一方面要求當局調查，一方面，陸戰隊立刻派士兵四出放哨，斷絕交通，檢查行人，情形非常緊張。</p>
<p>那時代理上海市長俞鴻鈞，就通知日本總領事岡本，請其鄭重行動，不要再刺激人心。</p>
<p>但是，日本太國方面怎樣呢？</p>
<p>東京各大報都用特號大字記載消條新聞。日本軍艦紛紛開進吳淞口，領導的正是「出雲」艦。</p>
<p>到二十六日，情形才安謐起來，人心漸漸定了。</p>
<p>然而宮崎貞夫的下落却仍舊不明·</p>
<p>日本領事館還在張皇失措的天天開會，可是突然之間，在靖江縣八圩港江面，忽然撈到了這個宮崎貞夫！</p>
<p>下面，是摘錄宮崎在警局裏的「自述」，他在文後還打了手印：</p>
<p>「在二十四日下午九時左右，我一人到靶子路一家妓院裏去了，到九點半，付了兩塊錢想走回去，有好像是中國人三人追來，向我再要討錢。爭了半天，我就坐人力車向和平塔走了。但是我從妓院出來的時候，會給一個日本水兵着見，他親眼看見我和這三個人爭吵，而我在爭吵的時候，因爲身穿軍服，怕給他們認出，所以把軍帽領軍都棄了才坐人力車到和平客。過了和平塔後，我用報紙把軍服包了起來，避了二夜。到二十六日淸早，就坐了英國船逃走。在船上，我是睡在甲板上的，船員說要報吿艦長，我因爲無票乘船，不勝恐懼，所以在二十六日下午一點，就跳下船去，投人長江。那時，船巳經到了靖江。二十七日，被人救了起來。」</p>
<p>靖江縣就把他送到江蘇省政府，二十八日下午，這個人被送到了外交部。外交部就把他交還給日軍當局。</p>
<p>可是，到了日軍手裏的時候，日軍覺得大大的失了面子。這場醜劇的主角立刻被捕，說是犯了什麼侵佔物賣的罪名，把他送回國去，一直監禁到最近才釋放出來。</p>
<p>宮崎貞夫在監裏過了十年，日本軍部似乎以爲已經遮了羞了。</p>
<p>這就是常常自誇爲「武士道」國家裏的「武士」行徑！</p>
<h3>失蹤兩愛子徘徊公署中　錢莊主人事業失敗　禍不單行飽受驚嚇</h3>

<h3>蕭瑟五金舊貨業　不堪回首滿庭坊　鼎盛時期已成陳迹</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「金玉里」，「滿庭坊」，這名稱是够美麗——美得近乎諷刺，走進一所牌坊式的大門，是一條骯髒黝黯的里街，沿着那潮濕的石子路走去，向西一折，穿過一　暗沈沈的茶館，「金玉里」就完了，接着是「滿庭坊」，不是滿庭芳華，而是些晦暗的，生了銹的黃銅白鐵。這兒雖稱爲坊，其實是一條狹窄的街道，西達石路，東通西上麟街，短短的一條街道裏，治門設肆，擺着許多廢銅舊鐵的攤子，這些攤子，和小銅匠挑的擔子差不多，面積比較大些，由東到西，大的有二十多個。有的人，因爲沒有生意，兩天或許休息一天。</p>
<p>設攤歷史　逾四十年</p>
<p>道兒是有歷史淵源的，據攤販說，遠在四十年以前，這兒就擺設着攤子了，起初是香燭和五金，慢慢的香燭業衰落了，五金却越來越盛，由少而多，以微致顯。有的由攤販而變成店主；有的由小攤擴充爲大攤；有的由幫傭而改成獨自經營；有的高飛遠走，變成了五金業的巨富。總之，這兒的人們，是父子相傳，師徒相授，經過了四十年時代的興衰消長，「滿庭坊」之名却確立了。那攤販從袖筒裏伸出手來，指着對面的一家五金店說：「那家店本來也是攤販，後來改成店了。」我看一看那家店，門面狹小，器物凌亂，然而比起攤販來，總算傑出的了。那店老板或許會感到驕傲，經過了多少年的努力，他總算置下了這一份家業，雖然這家業，在現在看來，依舊免不了不景氣和衰落。</p>
<p>零零碎碎　花色繁多</p>
<p>這兒的貨色大致都是零零碎碎的，譬如巨大的鋼鉗，小巧的銅鎖，鎚子，鐟子，鐵桿，銼刀等……還有機器零件，車輛材料等，因爲凌亂雜燕，由攤販來賣，比較最適合，有眼光的人，到不妨去掏掏的。一架廢置的機器，也許在這兒配到一樣廉價的零件，可以重新便用；一部破車子也許在這兒得到它所需要的東西，而再度行駛了。然而這都是過去的話了，現在這兒變成了非常冷落，那攤販對我說：「您在這兒待了半天，可看見有一家攤子做成了生意麼？」的確，不但沒有做成生意，運過問的人都沒有，即使有人買去一樣小零件，在他們也是九牛一毛，他們的希望是把所有的貨色一起出淸，改就他業，偶然賣掉一兩樣，他們並不滿意，也許倒是記者來和他們談談，他們得以藉此訴訴苦經，來得高興些！</p>
<p>勝利到來　存貨貶值</p>
<p>三十三年起，在敵人搜刮廢鐵的時期，似乎是他們的興旺時期，他們的貨色不在搜括之例，物稀爲貴，他們在那時候着實發了一筆小財，可是勝利以後，偽幣二百作一，存貨貶價，營業也就立刻衰落了！</p>
<h3>外輪來滬　勢將增多　應付碼頭倉庫擁擠　港務會決妥善準備</h3>

<h3>澈底消滅棉紗黑市　具體方案原則已定　政府供給外滙但須以紗易棉　棉紡公會今日討論實施方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宋院長爲澈底消滅棉紗黑市起見，昨日上午十時，再度召見紡管會吳兼主委，王啓宇，吳味經，榮鴻元，榮一心諸氏，共商具體方案。聞原則大致業已確定，茲探誌大要如决：（一）原料方面；（甲）組設原棉分配審核小組會，由婦管會執委會分配處處長李餘，及國民營紗廠代表各一人分任委員。（乙）在原棉許可輸入限額之內，准由各紗廠自行分配。（二）成品方面：原則上規定以紗易棉。換言之，政府供給購棉之外匯，同時按議價收回一部份之棉紗。如有餘額，仍歸各紗廠自由買賣。（三）國民營各紗廠營業一元化。除紡建公司原巳恢復掛牌制外，民營廠方面開紗事宜，應集中六區棉紡公會辦理。仍由該公會組織配銷委員會，掛牌開紗（四）每决開紗前，應將各支紗就其品質，種類。在低於市價之原則下，議定其標準價格。議價時應採機動万式，可按市面需要，及本身之存紗量，予以伸縮酌定。</p>
<p>第六區棉紡公會，當秉承宋院畏之意旨，於昨日上午十一時，召開常務理事會議。出席王啓宇，吳味經，榮鴻元，唐星海，劉靖基，郭瓊等。常將宋院畏召集會談時所決定之原則，作成方案，以便提出於十二日下午三時召開之紡管會常會上討論，同時並研究施行細則。</p>
<p>據某關係人士吿記者：政府此次開放美棉結匯，共輸入許可之申請，將分季（即三個月）辦理。照目前我國棉紗之生產量估計，每季輸入許可之限額，約爲廿萬至卅萬包。屆時爲提倡國棉計，政府當將根據申購美棉之數額，搭配一定比例之國棉。又據觀測：如以紗易棉制付諸施行，政府以能供給紡織業所需之大量原棉，則政府當亦能因此而易得大批棉紗。雖尚有餘額，供各廠自由買賣，惟究佔少數。故預料紗價前途縐勢，必穩無疑。同時今後開紗掛牌，國民營各紗廠採取同一步驟，議價又採機動方式，故預料棉紗黑市，當可因此根絕。</p>
<h3>市場傳言孔多　美鈔黑市激漲　金價亦被帶高</h3>
<p>烚赤昨平穩多盤，晨開二八五萬，開後續有殘多了結，而吿不支，逐漸下游，低價再降至二八三萬五，央行即以三八四萬之價，配給一四〇條，十時後，低後漸穩，逐步由實銷方面吸納，擁有餘資者亦有追購，供源稍止，午刻回升至二八六萬五，午後外幣劇昇，謠言助買，央行隨市有壓，是以隔日交判僅吿盤漲，最後升至二九〇萬大關，較前收漲起四萬五，飾金掛高至三〇萬四，紋銀平銀元稍低，暗拆銀根尚平，息價仍在一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外帶昨稍轉堅，港幣缺少供應，仍見秀色，美鈔暗市自五〇〇〇元起，午刻在五〇五〇元左右徘徊，午後又傳匯率更動，突起爭買，最後竟抬高至五二五〇元以上，較前收漲二百餘元，港票存底有限，經絨線帮及西商等求，急切上升，竟騰六十元，港匯一〇一〇元，英匯一六二〇〇元，印匯一二二〇元，午後均無賣價，成交極少。</p>
<h3>公債交易稀</h3>

<h3>茶銷毫無起色</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市英商出口行需求之高擋陳祁門，在吐納談判僵持下，交易依然寥落，而市勢則仍平定，他若抽珍珍眉等綠茶，品質低劣者，脫手猶極艱難，高擋貨舊價奇昂，過程均淸，茲悉午昌茶葉公司對於本年度新珠茶及新珍眉，復見垂靑，刻下已與賣戶在磋商中，至於紅綠茶內銷，續鮮起色，人心頻趨悲境云。</p>
<h3>青糖軋缺</h3>
<p>昨潮靑以號貨暫吿斷缺，故刁靑號方呌升數千元，較高開九萬八千元，次之九萬六千元，汕次赤十萬〇八千元，廣帮簿片靑八萬二三千元，興化白十三萬三千五百元，至十三萬一千元，次之十二萬四千元，興赤十三萬元至十一萬八九千元，公會劃盤現貨中砂白十三萬三千五百元，生砂赤十一萬八千元。</p>

<h3>麺粉廠難維持　因原料缺乏限價不夠成本</h3>
<p>本市麵粉工業，僅次於棉織工業，全市麵粉工廠，擁有大磨四千八百只，小磨一百零二只，馬達一百十四部，馬力一萬二百匹。目前因電力限制，產量大減。據該業鉅子談稱，該業生產一面受電力之限制，不能全部開工，一面則受原料之限制，蓋其麵粉所需麥子，我國產量不足，多賴國外輸入，月前各國均限制輸出，故來源益成問題，倘此後外麥再無輸入，則明年度恐有數廠將停止開工，此外該業製造成本甚高，而限價低廉，廠方維特亦感困難云。</p>
<h3>煤價緩步下游　唯鴻基屑獨堅</h3>

<h3>米市無甚變化　雜糧較有生氣</h3>
<p>米市南北共到一萬三千餘石，市勢依然早緊午懈，仍難生色，南粳結果無甚變化，麵粉趨勢亦頗軟化，麩皮照常萎疲，豆餅台總略有交易，回漲一二百元，黃豆本街納取，油廠揀巧拾收，市形站立，茶豆南洋去化續辦，價格步挺，再加千元，蠶豆胃呆出神，紅糧再入下游，回跌千元，苞米甚俏，無貨應市，生仁廣方動而不旺，趨市平庸，芝蔴高貨稀少，廣帮納胃甚強，形成高削决平之狀，油市近因天氣轉冷，生油大多凍結，銷路不爽，回小二三千元，市況盤旋，豆油零化尚殷，並無軒輊，蔴油已成跌定之狀，亦少榮辱。</p>

<p>在定貨方面，該業公會建議中信局所存廠絲，交由該業之工廠加工製成，運銷南洋美加等處，以開拓海外市塲。呈文中並指出：中信局配售之人造絲，每箱定價爲二百八十萬元，而政府與日本易貨之價格，照香港市價每箱僅五十餘萬元，獲利數額每箱在二百萬元以上。截至目前爲止，廠家巳購用者，有　產處理禺之五千四百滿，中信局之四千三百箱，合計政府獲利已達二百億元。故國家行局此時如能放數，實屬「取諸同業，用於同業。」股後並表示：如不蒙核准，則工廠除倒閉之外，別無他途，惟有將全部廠產機械及二萬餘工人職員，一併移呈國家，妥　着後。</p>

<h3>國大教育界代表胡適等提建議書　請政府注意教育問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕國大自由職業敎育界代表胡適，曹芻，葉溯中，葛爲　，楊展　，黃造雄，陳白，周斐成，蔣建白，周厚樞，王子玗，王義周，　通和，朱經農，陳錫芳，梁賢達·章益·阮志道等十八人，建議國民大會，請政府注意目前有關敎育之重大問題。原建議　，探誌如下：查敎育爲立國之本，亦爲施行民主政治之基礎。當今憲法正在制定之時，政府即將還政於民，尤賴敎育之普遍推行，以使人民有行憲與行使政權之能力，除憲法上對於敎育應有包涵性與適應性的規定，俾使國家基本政策得以推行無阻外，對於當前敎育上重要之事項，不能不略抒同人等之所見，以供政府在敎育設施上有所採擇，並冀社會關心教育之人士，寄予同情，一致主張，促其實現。</p>
<p>延用專才增進效率</p>
<p>第一，政府對於教育應延用專才辦理：敎育在近代已成爲專門學科，敎育事業在一般社會尤且專業性質，故辦理敎育之人員，必須具有專門之學識與經騐。目前從事敎育行政與敎學工作者，缺乏學識與經騐，一般人仍多以爲敎育行政與敎育事業人人能辦，敎員亦人人可當，故雜流並進，成績未著，而敎育遂亦不被重視，此等錯誤，必須立予糾正，政府必須愼重任用各級敎育行政人員，敎育主管當局，必須注意延用與所辦敎育有關之專才，中小學敎員，允應任用曾受師範訓練者充任之，俾敎育效率得以增進，而敎育之使命亦庶可逐漸一達成。</p>
<p>敵偽產業撥充經費</p>
<p>第二，政府對於敎育應撥巨款積極辦理：抗戰時期，敎育文化，最遭破壞，，勝利以還，敎育文化之復員則進行最爲遲緩。社會上旣未能廣泛援助，政府亦未能盡其全力，在整個經濟系統中，若干人士往往祗見敎育之消費，而忘却敎育對國家未來之供獻，致使多數被摧毀之學校，無法恢復，應添辦之學校。無法添皺，無數兒童靑年流浪街頭，無校可入，其情形至爲嚴重。中央應高瞻遠矚，視敎育復員及添辦學校、爲責無旁貸之舉，立撥巨款補助各級公私立學校復員並添辦新校，以收容失學兒童及靑年，以挽救目前之頹勢。又各地方敵偽及漢奸產業，並應撥充教育經費，蓋敵偽產業，大都由剝削人民而來，用之於敎育，最符合人民之願望。</p>
<p>縣教育局提早恢復</p>
<p>第三，政府對於地方教育應提早恢復縣敎育局並大量補助：縣以下地方敎育，以敵偽之破壞及受裁改科財政統收統支之影響，致地方敎育行政頓形紊亂，普及敎育之推行，進行亦致遲緩，原有敎育經費之獨立精神，亦破壞無遺，並經大量挪移別用，例如戰前地方敎育經費百分之四十或五十以上者，現在則降至百分之十左右，原有敎育經費本不裕餘，試觀地方敎育現狀，學校設備簡陋，不足供敎學之用，敎部待遇低落，月入四五萬元，至不能維持其個人生活，優良敎員紛紛改業，不合格人員在六十餘萬各敎師內，佔三十萬以上，甚至小學畢業即充小學敎師者，亦有八萬餘名，其嚴重情形，不言可喻。今後一面應令各省於三十六年度起，一律恢復各縣敎育局，一面應恢復地方敎育經費保障制度，務須專款專用，一面地方國民敎育經費，中央應增多補助，至少須負担四分之一，以期早日普及。</p>
<p>獎勱私校予以補助</p>
<p>第四，政府對於私人教育事業應力予扶植補助：查目前我國學校數量私人所辦渚實占公立學校三分之一以上，可見私人所辦敎育，對於國家敎育事業裨益甚大，勝利以還，私人敎育事業，政府置若罔聞，若干優良私校重建無力，政府並未有切實有力之資助，此實爲敎育上一大缺陷。私立學校敎職員，同爲國家公敎人員，而亦未享受國家同等之待遇，甚願政府對敎育事業，不分公私，同樣重視，予私立學校以獎勵補助，並予私立學校敎員以同等待遇。至在抗戰中被毀私立學校，仍欲設法復校者，允願政府予以切實有力之資助。</p>
<p>教員待遇迅即提高</p>
<p>第五政府對於教員應提高其待遇：敎育人員，不論從事國民敎育或其他各級敎育，均握國家新生之樞紐，近以物價高漲，生活艱難，各級敎員俱感痛苦，允以國民學校敎員爲甚，敎員不能溫飽，敎育效率從何而言？目前各級敎員之轉業及退避者，已成普遍現象，若不積極挽救，實可造成極嚴重之後果，至希政府具最大之毅力，下最大的決心，迅即提高敎員待遇，俾能適合當地實際生活之需要，並隨生活指數之增加，而予以增高，俾能安心而專業。</p>
<p>被佔校舍嚴令發還</p>
<p>第六政府對於被告用之校舍等應嚴切督責發還：勝利之初，秩序未定，部隊及行政機關，佔用學校及文化機關國體之房屋者甚多，迨秩序恢復，敎育應同時復員，但被佔用之校舍等，往往久假不歸，至若十學校，不能早日恢復，政府雖有通令，實未能澈底執行，甚盼政府嚴令部屬，認真辦理，立即發還，毋使教育界萌生怨望之心。</p>

<h3>大學球賽裁判問題</h3>
<p>好教師應該是好裁判</p>
<p>本星期六，大學足球聯賽，復且戰滬江，將再度角逐，而塲地與裁判，均已更改，第一次比賽時，雖然參加毆鬥的，不是球員與栽判，然而追究糾紛的起源，裁判技術的生疏，是不能諱飾的。各校體育主任首次會議時，陳陵即曾聲明，去內地十載，對足鐵裁判已不熟習，難免有錯。而出席會議的其他主任，則認爲大學體育負責人，而不能祖任裁判，是一種汚辱。復旦體育主任沈昆南，亦認爲一個好體育指導，不一定是位好裁判，反之，一位好裁判，却不見得是位好體育敎員。所以一塲球賽，對於裁判之是否稱職，廳於事前作愼重之考慮。前天記者晤復旦章益校長時，章校長亦認爲大學球賽，應該請裁判會裏的人來做裁判。但是，我們希望在大學任敎的體育負責人，除了敎導體育外，也願該注意裁判的事宜。固然「好教員不一定是好裁判」，但「好教員應該是好栽判」。在目前大學體育正在展開聲中，我們總不該有異議罷。</p>

<h3>無錫工業在不景氣逆流中邁步前進</h3>
<p>— 本報記者丁維棟</p>
<p>三個臺柱子　紗廠·麺粉廠·絲廠</p>
<p>無錫工業化的程度，在京滬綫上僅次於上海，工業用電的數字，足以證明這個事實。戚　腰的發電廠每天輸送八千匹馬力的動力給無錫工業，數量不能算低，但是電力的　饉依然是一個問題。大工業的動力是勉強有了，許多戰時興起的小工業，不得不以相當高的代價，自行裝置發電設備，而據電廠的工程師估訂：要滿足無錫工業的全部需要，恐怕再要增加每日八千匹的動力！而且這僅是目前的情形而已。以今日紗廠利潤之厚、加以錫人之勤勉務實。作擴充計劃者頗不乏人；在海外訂購紡錠者，今後一二年內將源源不絕的還來，如此生產力擴大，電力的需要更亟。我們如以此爲尺度，可以看出無錫工業化的前途，實是未可限量！</p>
<p>無鍋工業的台柱有三：紗廠，麵粉廠，絲廠。這三類工業，因爲客觀環境的關係，今日榮瘁之　，相去懸殊。記者在短促的旅程中，與三業人士均有接觸，對於各業之困難與展望，有一大槪的了解，今試依紗業麵粉業絲業的决序，作一綜合的報導。</p>
<h3>幸運的紗業　只需經營得法無不獲利豐盈</h3>
<p>棉紡業在多難的中國工業中，今日無疑是天之騙子。需要量火而生產不足，黑市價高而原料相對的便宜，不管大廠小廠，只需經營得法，沒有不大賺其錢的。無錫的棉紗沒有限價，每包售價在二百三十萬元左右，紗織業的繁榮可以想像得之。至於鍋地之紗廠，其規模較大產量較多渚，有申新三廠等各家。請參看附表如下：</p>
<p>其餘的小型紗廠，有一二千錠子者，尙有十多家。上表所列，是各廠的設備最高數字，事實上，戰爭中摧殘甚多，若干尙在修理的過程中，今日開工的沒有這樣多，全無錫今日轉動的紗錠是多少？有兩種佔計：一是十萬錠左右，一是十一萬錠左右。這就是說現在紗的生產量，不過戰前的60％左右而已。在抗戰初起時，敵人佔領無鍋，他們對於妨碍「工業日本，農榮中國」國策的中國紡織業是深深仇視的。申新三廠的七萬錠子，被有計劃的破壞，留下的不過一萬錠子而已！至於一四七八台布機，更是破壞一得一無存餘。申新的遭遇如此，其他各大廠的命運亦相類似。但抗戰勝利一年後的今天，雖然國家多難，社會經濟動盪不安，記者已能目擊申新已能恢復到五萬錠子，織布廠在燒焦的廠房中開始裝備，十二月份可能有五百台布機轉動。工人和職員在輝煌的電矩下，一樣的熱情工作；其他的廠家亦都有明日的展望和期待。過去的遭遇似乎僅是一塲惡夢，一切隨勝利而消逝了。我深深感到中國人忍耐力生命力之强，是度過一切難關的最火憑藉。　無鍋紗廠的原料，主要是美棉，亦間有一部份巴西棉。在戰前他們已能生產四十支六十支的細紗，現在則機件受損，只能紡二三十支的粗紗。工人的待遇亦較各業爲佳，大概自八萬至三十二萬，技工頭子待遇亦可至五六十萬元。他們的工資依生活指墩計算，據一位在工廠的朋友吿訴我！大概是上海工資的八折。錫地的勞炎糾紛，遠較上海爲少，原因有兩：各大紗廠的主要技工，大多服務有年，共歷甘苦，相處旣久，漸生感情，即使有所要求，亦出之善意協商方式，很少以罷工的姿態出現。二是錫地不比上海，地方的情形較單純，對於工人尙無大規模的組織和操縱的企圖，故情况較爲安定。最近錫地工人，鑒於生活費高上漲，要求將底薪提高一半，此事資方將採拒絕的態度，故將來勞資關係是否能如以往，很難預言。至於技工的效率，一位廠主說，只有職前的七八成。並不是身體衰弱，而是心理上起了變化，覺得技工到處受人歡迎，「此地不留爺，自有留爺處」，因此紀律蕩然，敎能减退。記者平時深感以目前我國工業情况而言，除畸形繁榮的棉紡業外，工資的負担實將窒息民族工業；但今日要减低工資是談不到的，因此唯一的補救辦法是如何提高工人的責任感，使他們能自發的提高工作效能。</p>
<h3>麺粉業黯澹無光</h3>
<p>和棉紗業相比之下，麵粉廠和絲廠顯得黯然無光，後者且在原料斷絕的危機中。麺粉在戰前本爲無錫的主要工業，有名的榮氏家族本以麵粉起家，當年創業時所用的石磨一片，至今尙陳列作爲傳家之竇。在抗戰九年之中，錫地因敵偽統制食糧，發生一種畸形的繫榮，一時集資開麵粉廠者，不乏其人。今日該地有規模的麵粉工廠，當推茂新廣豐振華等廠，其他規模較小者，的在十家以上。目前的不景氣，主因有三：（一）動力的供應不足，使生產力不能全部發揮，但開支却沒法節省。據此業中一位先生的估計：現在錫地每天的產粉量不過一萬包，但如果電力足的話，可以提高到二萬五千包。這話是相當可靠的。在茂新二廠中，戰前每日可產粉八千包，現在則因爲缺電關係，產量銳减，第一天出五千包，第二天出二千五百包，週而復始，其他的廠家的情形差不多。（二）原料供給，過去大部來自蘇北，因共軍的佔據，供給不暢，影響生產。（三）目前糧食業普遍的不景氣，麵粉業亦非例外；結果是原料價格上漲，而麵粉的售價不漲，無利可言。在以上三項不利條件之下，今日麵粉業的生產，只有戰前的三四成。同時，租稅的負担，亦使工業萎縮。現在每一包麵粉要抽貨物稅四百士元，至年終尙有所得稅利得稅。一家粉廠廠長吿記者二每月租稅的支出，比較員工的薪給伙食費要大得多。在目前銷路不暢的情形之下，小廠深受高利貸之　，年關時可能有一兩家宣吿淸理。</p>
<h3>絲業危機　較粉廠尤嚴重</h3>
<p>無錫的絲業，其危機較之粉廠尤爲嚴重。該地在戰前，的有四十家絲廠，在抗戰九年中，又產生了二十多家小廠，一共六十多家工廠，僱用工人兩萬餘名。其設備較多者，見下表：</p>
<p>廠名　車數</p>
<p>八達　一五六</p>
<p>中絲六廠　三〇四</p>
<p>正貿　一〇四</p>
<p>永昌　一一四</p>
<p>金城　二七二</p>
<p>美新　二九六</p>
<p>永泰　三一二</p>
<p>鼎新　二五六</p>
<p>江南第一繅絲廠　三六〇</p>
<p>所有這些絲廠，一論大小，目前均在原料恐慌之中，如日繭運華不能成爲事實，則本月底前均將停工。到明年秋絲上市時，成本又將成爲一個最嚴重的問題。目前政府的收購價格爲每担三百八十萬元（標準絲），但秋絲的成本估計在每担六百萬元以上；他們對於政府扶助絲業的德意，普遍感激；希望將來的收購價格，能够按實際成本再作調整。至於生絲外銷問題，他們有一個共同的看法：就是我們絲的生產，有兩大弱點：業種不如人，故絲之品質亦差；二爲工資大高，故絲之生產成本亦高；在短期內，我們尙難和勁敵日本競爭。</p>
<h3>一個生產的城市　〔生之者衆·食之者寡〕</h3>
<p>無錫三種主要工業的現況與展望，已經略述如上。和其他各地比較，使人帶有希望。工業如此，商業亦然。當然無錫的商業亦是不景氣，倒風亦是有，記者到錫之日，一家大藥房給高利貸逼倒了，一家有十多年歷史的米店，負了七億的債，還在掙扎奮鬥，情形是够慘的。不過，無錫有錢的人們，把錢用來辦事業，而一不索來放高利圖享受，畢竟有很好的影響。因爲事業一創立，本一身就僱用了不少的人，他業亦因一經濟學上的所謂「倍數法則」，連帶的增加了繁榮，因此無錫失一業的情形比各地好。同時，因爲是個生產之地，人民購買力較强，故雖在商業不景氣的逆流中，市況還是不錯。至於無錫的農民生活，則今不如昔，過去他們每年有兩筆收入，一筆是米，一是蠶桑，生活是不壞的。一年以來一砍桑而種稻，誰知道米價的上漲也不能和其他的物價成比例！農民一年的辛苦所得，竟做不了一兩身衣服。我國現在經濟上的大矛盾是：提高米價，則工價必漲。工廠將不能維持；反之如不提高米價，則百分之八十的農民，生活不準日益降落，購買力薄弱，商業亦不能繁榮。我把這問題問過一位無錫紗廠的朋友，他的意見是：「過去政府努力平物價，而忽略了工價；今後當努力减低工價，才能解決問題。」</p>
<p>無錫是個生產的城市，而且是游手好閒之徒甚少，「生之者衆，食之者寡」，因此不止能够自給，還有多餘的物力外輸。其所以能如此者，夭然環境是一個原因，但主要還是人爲的努力。人民的節儉務實，着於利用厚生，終把無錫造成了一個「小上海」——一個有上海長處無上海缺點的生產都市。中國如果有三分之城市，能够集中人民的聰明才智，像無錫人一樣的向生產事業上發展，記者相信改善人民生活的目標，必能提早實現。</p>
<h3>進取精神　修復戰時創傷　力求擴充業務</h3>
<p>無錫的工業界進取心甚强，他們的最大優點是生活節儉，不事奢侈，將所有的賢力用於發展事業。現在，一般工廠都有發展的計劃，不但要修復戰時的創傷，而且力求專業之擴張。以紗業而言，不論大小廠，都在海外訂貨。例如申新紗廠，戰前是七萬錠子，，戰時損失慘重，現在僅恢復到五萬錠子，但是他們現在計劃增加到十二萬六千錠子！在戰爭結束的前夕，他們就向美國廠家定貨，明春預計可以運到一部份。其餘的紗廠訂貨較慢，而美國目前只有三個廠可以製造紡機，本身的需要亦大；因此在一年之內，無錫紗廠的生產量，不致有很大的提高。以麵粉廠而論，一時的不景氣，不足以使進化的產業家灰心失望，相反的，他們亦定下遠大的發展計劃。例如茂新二廠正在計劃購買機器，在無錫設立一所日出麵粉一萬包的大廠；同時茂新一廠亦正在增置英國戰時使用的新式磨粉機，出品成績特佳。這一切，可以看出他們的進取精神。</p>
<h3>動力問題</h3>
<p>動力不足曾限制了無鍚區的工業生產，這個問題正在順利解決之中。無錫電力之所以不足，原因不一，首先是過去十年之中，誕生的小工業甚多，他們都需要用電。其次是戰前各家大廠中，都自有發電機，都在這動亂的多年中，有的發電機損失了，有的　置而不用，道部份額外的電力負擔，影響了整個供需的平衡；至於戚駁壞的供電量，因戰時機件無損，並無絲毫减少。申新紗廠的發電機，現在是由電奢借用，發電供給無錫。但這樣還是不够，許多小工廠得不到電，只好自行發電；大的廠家用電量亦有限制，超過限額時須以煤供給戚　堰電廠，作爲補償。現在經各方面努力下，各大紗廠在明春可恢復自身發電，而戚　堰電廠亦可得行總發電機和英國戰時發電機的供給，電的供應能力亦將提高。所以無錫動力不足問題，二三月後可有圓滿的解決。而在過去和現在電力的支配調度上，戚墅堰電廠確是任勞任寃，費過一番苦心的。</p>

<h3>生命綫上第一要津　長春掠影</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿八日航訊　本報長春記者方仁</p>
<p>長春，現在是一位貧血病患者，是一位左癱右瘓五癆七傷的嚴重的病人，是一灘沙漠，也有人說是一湖死水。</p>
<p>土生土長　參議員敢講話</p>
<p>記者首先要感謝長春市臨時參議會的成立，它使我這一位會場上的旁聽者，在大應之內，總那些「口若懸河」的人，報吿他們年來實際生活的感受，嚴肅點說，報吿他們年來實際工作的情形。</p>
<p>長市臨參會是十一月二十二日正式成立的。成立之後，便繼續舉行大會。現在還未閉幕。這會共有三十一位參議員，他們中有八位是來自鄕間的，因爲長春有八個區是屬於市區範圍之內，而那裏却盡住着以耕種爲生的農人。也有工會選出的代表，他們的提案與質詢，無不把工人的事强調得比任何代表所代表的利益還要神聖。而小學敎師拼命把有關小學生的事說得天花亂墜。還有兩位銀鬚飄然者，硬說雙十節市府舉辦的男女中學生五百人大合唱，爲「有失體統」，男女混雜，太不雅觀。更有幾位毛頭小伙子，在通過提案時，當討論到破除迷信一點，於是高聲大叫，把作燒紙的工廠，把紮紙人紙馬的「棚戶」，完全勒令停工，原因他們是助長迷信之存在的元兇！　記渚要特別强調出這一點：議員中確乎有好些是未見過塲面的人物，他們不僅是土生土長在東北，還是土生土長在東北的農村中，然而，却敢於大胆講話。有一件是美中不足的事情：三十一位參議員中，沒有一位是女的，說也奇怪，旁聽席上的女公民，連日以來，竟也是寥若晨星。</p>
<h3>兩句口號　造產重於稅收　開源重於節流</h3>
<p>單靠稅收是不足爲法的，所以蕭仁樹局長提出類似「口號」的兩句話，作爲今天解決長春財政問題的努力的標準，那便是：「造產重於稅收，開源重於節流」。什麼叫做造產開源呢？據蕭氏的意見是：（一）開放生產事業，因爲長春在東北生產事業所佔地位，雖非重要，但却次要；而這些大部份爲市民血汗所貢獻所建立，所以應該拿出一部份來，爲市民大衆享受。比喻說，長春紙烟廠如果爲市府經營，則市府經費便可大有辦法，但是這工廠却被吉林省政府接收了。（二）房地產租金整理下，月入兩三千萬元不成問題，但是，屬於中央的，中央接收了；而不屬於中央的，則却爲房地產管理局所接收。（三）成立一個市銀行，可以使資金活潑點，不像國家銀行那樣，受到過多的限制，而市銀行由四行轉帖現，這樣自然可以使市面繁榮，市府經費自然也受其利。（四）整頓稅收，使市稅經徵情形可以涓滴歸公，自對市府裨益綦大。（五）成立交易市塲，使牲畜糧食等稅無從逃避。（六）善於利用善後救濟物資。（七）使物資流通，儘量達成貨暢其流的要求。</p>
<h3>警政改革　當局煞費苦心</h3>
<p>在東北，由於敵偽時期的影響，「警察」總是和「特務」混在一起呌的，而提到「警察」與「特務」的東北人都不禁油然起厭惡與憤恨。因爲東北人在「發察」和「特務」的手裏，以「思想犯」「經濟犯」等名義，使不知多少人爹娘見不到了兒女，妻子見不到了丈夫。他們是日本人豢養下來的創子手，是人間生離死別悲劇的造成者，是殺人不貶眼睛的魔王，是祇知有己而不知有人的大混蛋。</p>
<p>中央接收東北之後，最感頭痛的，使是新的警政的樹立。因爲要使東北老百姓把腦十轉過來，百先得盡量把所有過去警察的惡習，完全一掃而光，讓這般親民的警察，從新的行爲上，使人民獲得新的認識。</p>
<p>長春在五月底國軍進駐之後，對於警政的整飭，可謂用了相當苦心，除過七月一日起創辦警察訓練所，到現在業已施訓三期，共得訓後警察五百四十七人外，並實行日常訓練，每日施訓兩小時，並利用紀念週及各種集會施訓。但是在譬政報吿之後，各參議員都熱烈地起立質詢，說十一月二十四日，警察在侵晨巡遲勤務中，於西陽區空房附近，將一手持洋鎬折空房地板的老百姓傅書銘給槍打死了，警察說：因見傳某持物而來，「見景不佳，乃行開槍」，這實在犯着重大的草營人命的嫌疑。此外警察還在郊區鄉間受理民刑訴訟案件，隨便打人押人，把「婚姻田地」的事情，判得一踏糊塗。</p>
<h3>大鼻子兵的業障　形成少年夫婦間的苦痛</h3>
<p>在警政報吿中，有一件特意人人注意的報吿，那報吿是一個統計數字，那統計數字係經調查蘇軍在進駐長春後，長春老百姓所不願遭受到的一些事情。那統計是姦淫二十八件，燒殺五十三件，掠奪二千八百四十二件，破壞十六件，共爲二千九百三十九件。</p>
<p>就在臨參會開會的現在，長春竟發生了這麼一件事情，可謂離奇，也可謂是上面那些統計數字中之一稱的現身說法。</p>
<p>少年夫婦兩人，感情素篤，客冬某黑夜，破門而入一大鼻子兵，不山分說，對女的强行非禮後一他去。少年丈夫覺得此種「災禍」爲不可抗拒者，對妻子依然情好，妻子本憤不欲生，見此更使愛情增加，兩人愈形「恩愛」。不幸今年十月，突生一子，身體髮膚，多有異象，經醫生檢騐結果，證明澈頭澈尾爲一混血兒。少年丈夫不禁中心納悶，是否在强迫性行爲後可以受精？醫生答覆有可能性。但此兒若在膝畔，則又足引起夫婦間不快之感，頗想置之死地。友人勸告：小生命本身無罪，大可不必殺生害命，若果眞因此兒會勾起傷心的回憶，則把此兒贈給他人，也是辦法。</p>
<p>像這樣的事情，不一而足，這也可以說明東北同胞對某些人不愉快的原因之一了。</p>
<h3>十月政績　從頭檢討一下</h3>
<p>從今年「四一四」回溯至三十四年十二月二十二日，長春市府這一個階段，是在蘇軍佔領下從事接收從事推行庶政。在這個期間有四件可說。</p>
<p>（一）組織敵偽產業保管委員會。這個機構係由地方士紳和各機關團體由市府召集組成。共同負實保管敵偽產業，編制淸册，以免損失，準備轉交中央所派負專實接收的人。</p>
<p>（二）組織房產調整委員會。這個機構旨在保管所有敵偽房屋，免爲人侵佔，問時更注意分配一部份房屋，作爲平民住宅。</p>
<p>（三）防範貧汚。接收伊始，深恐不肖員司乘機舞弊，結果查出處長一人接收人員三人凟職，均予懲處。</p>
<p>（四）整編保甲。光復之初，戶口保用均無從談起。旣經接收，遂着手辦理，計有八十餘萬人，當時辦理情形相當薯成效。</p>
<p>自「五二三」迄今這一段，則有下述各點可述：</p>
<p>（一）遣送日僑俘。長市辦理此事相當著效果。東北遺僑俘工作開始於五月十七日，而長春則在國軍進駐後開始。長市遺走共二十餘萬人。</p>
<p>（二）實施保民與警察會哨。此爲冬防期間爲使人民力量與警察合作，辦理哨務巡查及戶口清查等事務。目前正積極推動中。</p>
<p>（三）平抑物價工資房租。關於物價工資房租悉採取議價方式，由各有關團體共同議定價格，再經市府核定實行。</p>
<p>（四）扶助文化事業。遵照中央命令，市民言論出版均極自由。所以長市報紙雜誌出刋者相當多。</p>
<p>（五）安撫靑年。與長官部前進指揮所在夏間協同辦一靑年暑期訓練營，收容松花江北來歸的靑年。並曾爲受訓中一部份人解決職業問題。</p>
<p>（六）整理市財政。遵照行轅指示，簡政减員，非迫切需要均予暫緩辦理。同時對市財政，力行開源節流。</p>
<p>（七）增進公用及衛生事業。改進自來水，尤注意飲水之清潔問　。市區電車及公共汽車，在兵　中破壞無餘，但經積極整修，已能使市區行駛車輛大有增加。疫癘之防止，允不惜人力財力着手力辦。</p>
<p>（八）加强敎育。長市不僅求學生數量上之增加，同時並爲提高師資水準，曾舉行敎師講習會觀次，而且强化師範學校。</p>
<p>（九）改進警政。改變警察觀念，取締高壓作風，提高服務精神，培養愛國意識。尤其爲　成長市洽安第一之要求，所以所有警政設施，主要多在配合軍事。</p>
<p>（十）淸理房地產及地政建設。過去房地產案卷，惜燬於「四一四」大火中，而現在接收工作，尙多未完竣，敵偽產業主權尙未確定，所以新設立地政局，今後當協同財政局專責辦理地政及房地產之淸理調整等事。</p>
<p>上面全是經報吿出來的工作成續，當然也有正在着手的，不過，十月政績，從這裏總可以窺出一些端倪。</p>
<h3>展望前途　長春自有千秋</h3>
<p>長春現在正在苦難中。但正因其如此，人看到了其「落寞」的現况。不免感想特多，責際，畏春自有其「千秋」。展眼前望，長春實在還有她美麗的未來。</p>
<p>長春位於九省中心，爲東北重鎭，爲偽滿首都，爲貫通歐亞中長路上重要的據點，一句話，是中國生命綫上的第一要津。</p>
<p>不過目前嚴重的事實，則在於市經費不足，以這樣一個洋洋大觀的都市，鬧窮鬧得一踏糊塗，如果在財源上不想到根本解決的辦法，則長春人竭盡全力，恐也無法保養此都市，無法使此以東北人民血汗建設起來的都市，經久不改其舊觀。遑言重新建設，乃至其他。所以，臨參會的參議員建議，改長春爲陪都，改長春爲院轄市，請行營進一駐長春等，與其從積極方面着眼，說是在求重建長春，毋寗從消極方面去看，說是求長春市財源獲得解決辦法，方爲允當·同時，臨參會上也報吿到：上海天津雖同爲院轄市，但同時都是市經費出超得厲害的都市，故長春之請求爲院轄市，當能獲得政院核准的吧。</p>

<h3>寫作的道德</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>最近本刊收到一籥稿十講到開明二十八年出版的一本「化學計算法」近來被人用一種巧妙的方法改頭換面抄製出版，其間把兩　分析比較頗詳，可惜限於篇幅未能登載，可是因此使我想到寫作者的道德問題。寫作本是一種很　苦的事，假使有人　　文爲生，那已是末路，若再有人偷竊剝削，那簡直是太無心肝了。</p>
<p>這又使　想到若十年前有兩家書店爲兩家所出版的英文敎科書相類似而打官司的事。有人說中國人有一個毛病，就是自己不知道努力創造，看見別人在某一方面略有成就或略　利潤的時候，他便起而效允，模倣，假冒。例如在上海就沒有人知道，那一家陸　　是眞的。所奇怪的是在中國文化水準較高的出版界也會發生這種現象。爲甚麼我們不能力求上進，精益求進呢？我們要設法撲滅這種投機取巧的心理。</p>
<p>中國出版界無論在物質方面或精神方面都是非常的　乏，這無可　言，所以我們一方面希望有資本的人從事於出版事業，政府設法加以扶持（例如放出貸款和免收出版物的營業稅等），另一方面在寫作者方面多多充實自己的內容，努力於研究工作，保持高尙的人格。至少我們要維緊最低限度的寫作的道德。</p>
<h3>太平天國史事日誌介紹一本信史</h3>
<p>— 羅鴻濤</p>
<p>郭廷以著</p>
<p>商務印書館出版</p>
<p>一千四百餘頁</p>
<p>價一萬八千元</p>
<p>太平天國之天京，於公元一八六四年七月十九日（即淸同治三年六月十六日），爲淸軍所攻陰。覆亡至今，已八十餘年，而關於此一大革命運動，尙無一完善之紀錄，此眞治史者之一大恥辱。今郭君此書之出版，適足以彌補此一大缺憾，實學術界一大幸事也。案世人對於太平史實，其看法的可分四個時期。自其覆亡後，內而淸廷上下，外而英法帝國主義者，共同作惡意之反宣傳，誣蔑太平軍，竟流寇草賊之不若。同時民間復造作種種想像爲之殘暴事件，此爲第一時期。及民元前後，革命之風氣已在波動，一般人竟認太平軍爲革命先烈。從而造作種種史料，（如柳亞子先生民廿三年八月二十日書云，石達開詩鈔祖本，出亡友高天梅手輯。其中杜撰甚多，大半皆天梅所偽造，蓋當時鼓吹革命，借文字爲宣傳利器也，可爲此說作一確證。）更有憑借想像，如洪秀全爲朱九　之徒，洪大全封天德王，錢江上書等等，似是而非之事蹟之產生，此爲第二時期。民國九年劉牛晨若自不列顚博物院，鈔印太平天國有趣文件十六種，自此以後，向海外發掘太平史料者日益衆多；程演生君自巴黎東方語言學校圖書館；蕭一山君自倫敦不列顚博物院東方部；王重民君自英國劍橋大學圖書館；俞大維君自柏林普羅士國家圖書館，咸有最大之收穫。（據學者之意見，上列四家中，以蕭君所得爲最多，俞君所得爲最精，俞君部份，承張菊生先生校正，輯入拙編太平天國詩文鈔中，惜今已絕版。（而國內之故宮博物院，亦有此項原始史料之竣現，百年秘藏，一且重見於人間，助長研究實爲不少，此爲第三時期。然研究太平史實，雖成爲史學家一時之風氣，而所得皆一鱗半爪，未有人能作全面之研究。有之，自郭君此書始。書首羅家倫君序文，謂郭君在此一問題默默無聞的費了上十年的功夫，才有這偉大的收穫。而郭君自視歉然，以爲此書爲工具一類的史事記，只求爲他人作預備工作，希望具有才識德學的史家，得此便利，可以有完全紀錄的產生。道是第四個時期。平心而論，郭君的工作在目下說，是成功的。</p>
<p>此書記事，開始於嘉慶元年，結束於同治七年。除專記太平天國及捻軍史事外，同時於此大　亂之背景，亦盡量記述，如嘉這兩朝之　動，各地民變，以及大地會三合會之活動，均在紀錄範　之內。所記事實，各方並顧，惟限於材料，軍事記戰，實居其大牛，祀載事實，以時間先後爲序。所記月日，係中西歷並舉，同時太平軍所行施之新歷，荀可考見，亦加附註。月日事實，力求正確。其涉有疑難者，則博採羣　爲之考釋，眞不愧爲優美之作。同時作者對於地方志認爲有若干重要資料，爲他處所不能見者故盡量採用。這是研究太平史者新開的一條徑路。雖然他能向淸華·中央·燕京。金陵四大學，及中央政治·北平·南京國學等圖書館，借得到參考書，有着良好的憑藉，可是他治壓的精神也是令人佩服的。</p>
<p>本書正文　　値得稱許，就是所附的八個附錄也値得介紹一下。</p>
<p>第一附錄，天歷與陰陽歷對照及日曜簡表。此種工作，在郭君前己有數人。可是天歷干支與陰歷干支並不一致，彼此相　一日。而太平日曜與西洋日曜亦不相符，亦提早一日。有此兩點之差異，前人工作完全　棄。而郭君此表，却是値得引用，保無錯誤的。</p>
<p>第二附錄，太平天國人物表，這簡直是一本小規模的太平史人物傳。前有爵職解說，有詳確之考證。每表分爵銜姓名籍貫經歷生卒附註等項，紀事　富，檢查便利，合於應用。</p>
<p>第三附錄，主要戰役將帥表。每一戰役記錄其主將部屬地域對方主將等。在太平軍方面共計十八表，在淸輩方面共計七表。這二十五稱表非將全部史實，網羅胸中，實在不能下筆。這是何等難得的努力。</p>
<p>第四附錄，洪淸兩軍戰爭地圖；共計十四幅。左圖右史，古所並重。我們有了此項地圖，　起史來，更能增進興趣。羅家倫君序文，亦謂附地圖的方法，是出於近代的觀念。若非近代技術的進步，是辦不到的。</p>
<p>第五附錄，淸譽師大臣表。第六附錄，剿捻統帥表，兩表分記職　姓名任期本職駐地附註等項，有助於檢查。第七附錄，洪淸兩方將帥簡裏，搜羅宏富，記</p>
<p>第八附錄，引用書目表。所錄各書，以郭君曾經參考據以　輯者爲限。書分兩部：一爲中文。計一九七種，又地方志三八〇種，期刊八種；一爲西文，計四三種。每　之後，略加解說評述，以明其性質。引用之書，在六百種之外，然筆者所可得而言者，郭君此表，初非誇示其搜羅　宮，實際上郭君確會逐一予以引用。此其所以難能可貴也。</p>
<p>最後有須聲明者，郭君此書，實爲治太平史者，不可不備之書。蕭一山君，爲治淸史之標威，於太平史學，亦多所閘發，對於太平史籍，授羅最多，郭君此書，宜早經寓目。乃最近與之通信，知其尙以未見此書爲憾。專家尙屬如此，更　言他人，用是不避多事之識，乃爲文介紹之。</p>
<h3>人文地理學傑構中國的地理基礎</h3>
<p>— 雋之</p>
<p>葛德石著　薛貽源譯</p>
<p>開明書店卅五年九月出版</p>
<p>地理與人生閱的關係，是最密切的。我們要瞭解中國的種種人事關係，可以說是需依賴於地理的研究，因爲由於它才可理解農業，資源，氣候，區域，人生各項問題的因素。</p>
<p>這本書的作渚葛德石敎授，僑居中國很久，經歷了十餘年的研究和旅行才得完成這著作；同時，這著作也正是他十年多的心血結成。著者在中國是任美國國務院文化事務局所屬的訪華敎授　，及美國全國學術聯合會，美國全國科學院兩團體的駐華代表；由於道許多方便，進行的研究工一作，反較我太國人爲佳。我們中一國的地理學者，絕沒有機會作這一樣長時間，消費不少資金來從事一研究。因之，作者雖爲美國人，一而這本書尙是我國地理學中一册一較有成就的新地理學著作。</p>
<p>在今天，這本著作無論是否地理學家，均値得一讀，正如作者原序所說：「中國現正處於空前的社會，經濟，及政治的調整中。一個素具孤立和守舊特性的大國，現在却很快　更始其生命，而成爲世界國家的一員了。若干由演變而發生的問題，地理學誠不能自詡都能加以解決，但對此演變的一些背景，則可得而說明之。」</p>
<p>社會的地理基礎</p>
<p>這册「中國的地理基礎」，是葛德石關於中國地理著作的總論部份，分地理量觀，地形，氣候，農民，天然富源，世界往來六部份來分別說明。</p>
<p>現在，我們試看它底內容：　第一章「地理景觀」方面，它指出中國的景觀上最重要的因素，不是土壤，植物或氣候，而是人民。這一點，我們是可爲信賴的，在中國道古老的土地上，很難找到一小塊地方沒有經過人們的活動渲染了的。　同時，作者也指出中國的自然孤立性，在過去的歷史上，中國周圍都有阻隔的障碍，而未曾和世界其他部份接觸，知識的交換也就很少；道是熱帶的叢林，高大的山地，廣大的沙漠，遠闊的海洋，共同保持了中國的統一和孤立。</p>
<p>湯姆士在「社會的環境　礎」中說：「現在普遍都承認，文化進步的最重要因素，就是多種文化的接觸，而所以產生停滯，則　若孤立。某一種　境足以按觸另一環境並供給一條通路，與另一區互相往來，必能　勵人民心理的可　性和文化的進步；反之，一個孤立的環境，必將引起心理的停滯和重複。」</p>
<p>由此，我們可明白中國科學所以落後的原委。</p>
<p>本章中另述及對比性的地方，劃出南方和北方的對照表，人口的壓力；並說明新舊交通，把各地汽車與公路例表計算。</p>
<p>作者在本章的結論，「理解中的中國」一段，因寫作的年代不同，所以有幾處是不正確的。但作爲一個參考，是極有價値的</p>
<p>氣候和農地關係</p>
<p>第二軍「地形」方面，它說明地質的　礎；中國誠然沒有歐洲和北美那樣的冰川特色，作者乃把我們的特質列舉出來，這裏不能一一爲之介紹出來。</p>
<p>此外，關於山地，河流，冲積平原，邊海，及中國版圖的變遷，作者均用了很充分的材料說明；並把中國各省人口與面積的調查列表以供參考。</p>
<p>氣候——決定人類活動的因素，本書第三章就講道問題，它述出中國氣候的物理性，這是受地形和海洋關係依次轉變而來的季風運行，偶然的熱帶氣旋，和一連續大陸性風暴，才產生出來的一氣候區，氣候與人生方面，一它也充分闡述，及風向的插圖，一平均溫度與平均雨量的表格。</p>
<p>第四章是關於「四千年來的農民」，當然，中國向稱農業國家，農業問題自最爲重要。本章，作者先說明晨　景觀，次再　到農業的基礎，及中國耕地的廣表，列表解說歷代的耕地與各省耕地，更將各省耕地與作物面積詳表報吿。作物產量也有表說明。</p>
<p>中國農業問題，時至今日尚　　　。作者指出以往中國農業問題　重性之一般。中國魚　科學化，需要社會的改造，目前時局的基本　結解除之後，當可踏上這道路。</p>
<p>天然富源的間題，，在第五章中討論，它先講歷史的背景；煤的來源及世界煤儲量，伸引出這最重要的動力——煤的開礦。接着就把煤的儲藏估計，各礦塲煤產量列表加以分別說明。</p>
<p>其他動力的來源方面，如石油。鐵及其他金慶非金屬之類，說明外亦附表；章來，說出中國礦物的生產，中國實業的前瞻。</p>
<p>展望中國的貿易</p>
<p>最後一章，是「中國與世界的往來」，作者述出其歷史背景，中國最　的向西遠征和貿易，是漢武帝時才始，至十九世紀時輸出貿易漸與，它列表　說出直接輸出外國的貨物，及對外貿易商品之比較。</p>
<p>織入貿易當然遠　於輸出貿易，這是鴉片戰爭後，國際資本主義打開了中國獨立自主的　　，而造成孫總理所說次殖民地的地位。本書作者也指出：「多年來有形的進口貨　是大大的超過出口的貨値。這種所謂不利的貿易平衡，近年來逾益利害。」</p>
<p>最末，它說明中國的　易　，以及各口岸對外的貿易。至此，本書乃吿結束。</p>
<p>讀完此書後，對於中國的　理，已具有一基礎認識的輪廓。故這本書是可作　習中的靑年，一個基本的認識。</p>

<h3>重讀〔父與子〕</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>屠格涅夫著　巴金譯</p>
<p>文化牛活出版社　卅五年九月版三六五頁</p>
<p>在文藝領域裏，法國浪漫色彩的文學，是用那　麗地文筆，吸引了很廣的讀者。由此，我們想到：屠格湼夫道個著名的作家。他底小說，散文詩，都陶醉了無數靑年。屠格湼夫本身是俄國人，而且是貴族血統。但他在法國求學，因之，他的作品，逃脫不了法國浪淺主義的色彩。</p>
<p>格湼夫的作品，大都以蘇俄沙皇時代，靑年對舊勢力的抗爭作主題。但，他祗是側面地描寫，用他　練的文筆，「虛無主義」的靈魂，描繪出那些在文藝中不朽的人物。</p>
<p>「父與子」道部小說，描寫蘇俄農奴解放時代的新舊思想衝突，用他優美的筆調，通過了他底人生觀的三稜鏡而把它發展出來。</p>
<p>這部小說的內容大致講：</p>
<p>一個進步的地主，俄國貴族的後裔—尼可拉，他那由彼得堡大學回家的兒子—阿爾卡狄，這一雙父子，是中心人物。作者從他們二人的性格，發展出輝皇巨著。</p>
<p>阿爾卡狄是一個　無生義的信服者，授予他這信心的是他底同學巴札洛夫；這次他回家的時候，是同伴着巴札洛夫一起來的。因此，對於他老父尼可拉的一切行動，都是以他那虛無主義的眼光來批判。而使他老父有時感到很不痛快。</p>
<p>尼可拉有一個哥哥帕威爾，是一個十足貴族尊嚴的保持者，一個頭固的老人，因之巴扎洛夫與他常常發生爭論。</p>
<p>好些日子以後，二個志同道合的虛無主義者，在一個歡迎會上，認識　一個美麗的太太安娜；從而，不知不覺地墮入了戀愛之城裏面，他們在安娜面前一切舉止行動，似都有些與往日異樣了。</p>
<p>兩個虛無主義者，一同走入了安娜的莊園之後，巴扎洛夫獲得了勝利。而阿爾卡狄却與安娜的妹妹開的亞也十分熱情。</p>
<p>不久，他們二人覺得單鑽在戀愛的牛角尖裘，未免太不値得。於是他們脫離了戀愛的糾紛，　時同到巴扎洛夫的家裏去住。　巴扎洛夫的父親是一個　明的小農奴。他們到了那裏之後，戀愛的絆索並沒有脫離了他們；阿爾卡狄又借故跑到安娜的莊園·巴扎浴夫則想起了尼可拉　愛的一塡房」費尼，而到了尼可拉家裏，並且得到了機會與費尼接了兩次吻。</p>
<p>這一秘密却給尼可拉頑固的哥哥帕威爾知道了，怒不可遏，約好了與巴扎浴夫決鬥。決鬥的最後，那頑固的老人受了傷，由於這敎訓，老人倒改去了以前的頑固而與新潮流妥協。</p>
<p>巴扎浴夫不能再居住在尼可拉的家裏了；他離開之後，曾跑到安娜那裏把這事情吿訴阿爾卡狄，並且還與安娜見了一面，終而回到他自己老父的田莊。</p>
<p>這裏，尼可拉由於他那改變後的哥哥的相勸，打破了階級觀念與費尼正式舉行了婚禮。阿爾卡狄也與安娜的妹妹　愛成功，與他父親同一日子結婚。</p>
<p>父與子在同一吉”良辰上，結合了兩對新人；之後，父子共同經營農業，做得很順利；家庭之間，也很融洽，在那美滿幸福的環境下，他們過着那甜密的生活。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫呢？他回到了家裏之後，幹着與農民施醫的工作，可是，他某次解剖一不留心，染上了可怕的疾病，便結束了他底一生。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫的父母，在他們兒子底靈前常常　吿，哭泣着／</p>
<p>這部巨著，在這裏作了它最後一頁。</p>
<p>讀了這部作品，很明白地　出它是以戀愛的波潤起伏爲綫索，充分地表露出浪漫主義的氣氛，及其非現實性。在戀愛的糾葛中，各種思想是沉默了。</p>
<p>巴扎洛夫，原是一個前進的思想者，在這裏是到處碰壁，苦惱。結果他毀滅了自己。</p>
<p>阿爾卡狄，雖是巴扎洛夫的崇拜者，但沒有巴底桀驚不訓；受了他父親與伯父的愛護，結果也做了事業的隨從者。</p>
<p>尼可拉呢？他的牛前進的思想，與他的兒子合作，走入了粉紅色幸福的家庭裏；他底哥哥也改革了一部頑固的貴族的自尊心，而取得了妥協。</p>
<p>這部作品在文學的描寫方面，是不可否認地有它底技巧的精美。結稱方面也稱完美。唯在意識方面，前面已說過，並不能配合事實，而全有俗物主義的方式。</p>
<p>它把一個前進的靑年，用譏諷的筆寫成自己毀滅的道路，而在貴族方面，作者反其有同情心。帕威爾的妥協，尼可拉父子的甜密生活，正與巴扎洛夫相反。</p>
<p>這作品描寫的文笨很値得學習，因爲這作品在常作藝術品來　，是一件很好的精品。譯者巴金是根據英文本譯出的，譯筆方面尙稱通暢，唯興原文方面未必完全一致。總之，道是一件描繪得很美麗的藝術品！</p>
<h3>關於蘇聨人</h3>
<p>— 九章</p>
<p>A．WHITE：A　REPORT　ON　THE　RUSSIANS</p>
<p>這本書的作者，威特先生，一九四四年夏天在美蘇關係極融洽的時候到蘇聯去觀光，得到「特准」，可以「看自己所要看的，回國以後寫自己所願意寫的」。他到過蘇聯腹地馬拉爾工業區，這是一九二六五年計劃開始以後任何外國人沒有到過的地方。他進入烏克蘭剛剛收復的農村，和農夫談話，想聽到他們眞實的心坎費的話。其間當然也有一兩决，思想統治之鐵腕阻止了威特先生訪問的自由。他們到一個西伯利亞的工廠裏參觀，他和一位操德語的女工談得很投契。可是威特剛一轉身，一位秘密警察（NKVD，　名GPU）就對那和她談天，她就唯唯諾諾或默默不語了。「在蘇聯，那兒有人可以自由和外國人交談呢」？但是，大體上，威特一羣人的訪問已經很自由。尤其是他在莫斯科和一位女翻譯官辯論，他坦白地說明他以爲蘇聯不如美國的地方；那坦白的程度恐怕會使讀者驚異罷。</p>
<p>我個人特別發生興趣的是一般蘇聯人的生活到底怎樣？本書作者的觀點碰巧正是如此：他不去空泛地論蘇聯的政策，却常常要知道一個工人的目用帳。一般人的生活水準是施政的成績，而不能算軍事秘密。把這種材料當做軍事秘密，因而引起人家的懷疑，總是一種不智之舉。</p>
<p>第三章裏，作者叔述他參觀了三個莫斯科的工廠，一個飛機製造廠，一個汽車工廠，和一個餅乾廠。在第一廠他打聽一下工作時間和工資。普通工人的工作時間是每週六十六小時，所得是一千盧幣。在工廠食堂裏喫一天飯化五個慮幣，很便宜。可是剩下的每月八百或者更多的盧幣能買什麼呢？在「商店」裏火腿一千多盧幣一磅，鷄肉五百左右一磅。　衣服那就更貴了。所以這位工人先生到本工廠食堂去喫飯可以果腹，到指定的戲院去看戲可以消磨幾天晚上，但「離開了工廠他的衣食立刻成問題」，他不能如美國人似的有積蓄，威特先生說「工廠在理論上是屬于工人的其實工人是屬於工廠的」。</p>
<p>在第二個工廠，咸特先生問「經理」假使工人工作意惰怎麼辦？「其先是壁報上警吿，以後到工會去講話。威特先生立刻了然！工會已變成約束工人的組織了。另一次（第八章）威特問一個工會領袖，如果工人不滿于目前的工作，能不能到別的地方去？答案是「他必須向廠方申請」。「如果不　請而團開，他能不能在別處找到工作」？答案是「不，在全蘇聯他將很難找到工作」。威特先生還　　問：。「這不是相當于黑名單嗎」？答案是「不能算黑名單」。美國人頭惱裏的「自由」在蘇聯的字典上查不出。至於第四章中作者把蘇聯工人和美國監犯的生活比擬起來，也許嫌憤激一點龍。、，以此類推，「全　蘇聯的工人的待遇相差不多，因爲工廠全屬政府的，待遇全是政府規定的」。中國讀者也許有人贊成這種辦法，美國一般人却看不慣。</p>
<p>「在蘇聯，在業工人的生活，還不及美國經濟恐慌時期領取失業津貼的工人的生活」。這句話可靠到什麼程度，很難說。但是像書中那蘇聯女翻譯官的話也只好算「聊以解嘲」她說？「我自己很苦，但我知道別人皆苦，我一就安慰了」。有常識的人皆知道一社會主義打的旗號是要實現「人一問天堂」，不是大家一樣窮。打一的旗號和做的眞事總會有距離。一種理想，到實行的時候，總會有些變了樣子。法國革命前後是如此，俄國革命也未嘗不如此。</p>
<p>筆渚對於美蘇兩種經濟）制度沒有研究，只好就威特先生所認爲的蘇聯缺點，簡略說一下。（一）蘇政府從一個中心（克林姆宮）去計劃，去指導全國工廠的活動與發展，是一件很難的事。各個工廠的「經理」或負責人容易因循起來，少自動性（InitiatiVe），而且有些技術人才管理人才因政治路綫時有被清算之　。（二）取消了牟利的心理，競爭心减少，一般人不想改進生產方法。照威特先生看，美國的制度對於新發明的刺激力總比蘇聯制度大。史達哈諾夫運動其實是暗中恢復競爭，可是「勛章」的鼓勵並不及實利。「一般地說，資本主義社會裏有發明，社會主義模仿着。」這是威特的看法。</p>
<p>不過，書中讀到的，也就是作者看到的，蘇聯優點也很多。譬如：蘇聯人生活水池較美國低，可是沒有乞丐。在戰時，牧資總是　第一綫軍人用。以及蘇聯政府　於處理少數民族間題等。這此事作者絕未抺煞。</p>
<p>「印象記」或「回憶錄」之類的書，在英　書籍中成一重要部門。文字流利，有如小說；觀察獨到，足供專家采摘。這本書亦如此。但我們的戰後出版界一時還很少見這一類的書。</p>

<p>爲什麼要介紹這一類型的藝術呢，就政治哲學的觀點說；中國自三代以降，因爲受封建思想的影響，民族思想領域已逐漸有了無形的樊　，社會因之日趨理智，在廣大的社會中，與夫人民的心理上，已經造成了一定的態式，與信仰，因之文化的本身，兩千年來入於停滯的階段，此一無形中含有病態之社會，在近百年來，更感受國際上在經濟種種方面的壓迫，後由理智而趨於貧困，因之自然的形成了，自私自利勾心鬥角，使社會陷人崩潰粉碎一盤散沙之境地，而這也就是光總理從事革命工作的原因之一了。鼎革之後，繼之以堅苦之抗戰，亦竟已竟其全功，在戰前戰後就政治以及種種方面之改進來說，凡屬明大體的工作人員，多已在領袖的逐日督責之下盡其最大之力量，而仍不能挽救，社會之頹風於萬一者，其問題自亦別有听歸矣。</p>
<p>以管見所及，今後復興之道，一爲科學，一爲藝術，科學的重要人所共知，而藝術之重要，允重於科學，則不易爲一般人士所理解，舉例，試就自然科學的工業產品來說，凡屬找到宇宙間自然規律愈是眞實，那麼力量就愈大，對於人類的貢獻也愈多，然而任憑是原子彈也好，飛機也好，他的性能力量終於是有限的，究竟操縱宇宙，撼動宇宙的，還是人類，原因在於人類有一個微妙的靈魂，因此古人治國，對於人類的靈魂生活，以及靈魂的住宅所謂人體，的耳目口鼻，在衣食住行種抓方面，均有所養，（禮）作爲其政治　施之依據，所以其政治哲學是，禮節民心，樂和民聲，政以行之，刑以防之，禮樂刑政，四達而不悖，則王道備突，從而知道，刑政是不得已的設施，禮樂乃是其生活之要件，（禮者養也，應作時間及空問藝術之節，來看，就人事來說，是人與人間的分寸而已，請參閱史記司馬遷論禮樂作篇）</p>
<p>自然科學已經到了這樣複雜的階段，那麼培植人民心靈的藝術，也必須與自然科學的功能作平行的進展，才能產生均衡的效用，比如古人的轎子，多麼好　，再也沒人去坐，因爲同飛機火車的功用，相去太遠了，所以古代禮樂的功能，一部分應由樂劇來代替，因爲樂必入於劇，才能刺人之心，應人之節，我們實在不能因爲有一個劇字，便以爲那不過是對於人生的一種裝飾而已，因爲歌劇是一種有力量的機體，綫條色彩的運用，是人類精神上視覺科學的創造，節奏旋律是人類憲魂上聽覺科學之創造，一切進步的藝術，都是培植靈魂的科學。惟有對於靈魂有良好的培植，人與人間才能發生熱力，人的襟懷才能大起來：才能有彈力，有同情心，社會才能活躍起來，而有新的生機，因此歐美任何一個科學發　的國家，也必是　術發達的國家，因爲社會平治，科學才有　礎，精神不入正軌，社會無法望其平治，是有相互作用的。這便是應當重視這種藝術事業的原因之一了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>就時代藝術哲學的觀點來說。中國的社會，旣已陷入於理智貧困的階段，在藝術上如果再從事挑撥，或予以分歧的暗示，直接受害的乃是民衆，針對着過去封建社會所給予我們社會太形現智的史實，似乎不能不在情感藝術的創造上有所祈求因爲社會不是一味破壤所能弄的好，也不是一味鞭馳所能奏效的。</p>
<p>以下要我就創造的觀點，來說幾句話，因爲這對於孟姜女一劇的分析，是必需的，凡是一種偉大的藝術，他自身便是一種美的境界，有着不可侵犯的風格，有此格，而後能格人，一種美的境界，必有他構成的因素，就音樂來說，因爲有節奏所以能超越現實，因爲超越現實所以們人才能忘其醜惡，而一種美的境界與夫偉大的風格，就歌劇來說，其成功，往往不屬於一種，表現介體的成功，因爲他必須是各種表現介體的均衡發展，才能產生一種靈肉協和的有機組織。但是有的時候，也有例外，如果某種表現介體有牠獨具的美，亦可逐漸誘致其他表現介體與之協和，而逐漸形成一個完整之組織，例如人類的靈魂是先天的賦與，他衣　行動的配合，是受着靈魂的支配的，雖然一種粉飾，也有時候敎人眞偽難辦，所以一個歌劇藝術家，如何把握着那開務成務的法門，的確不是一件容易事，孟姜女樂舞　的　能可責處，乃在於對於這種協和的運用，立有了相當的基礎。</p>
<p>中國音樂的獨立風格究竟是什麼呢？這是首先要研究的問題，中國是一個倫理道德的社會，所以在音樂方面不是以音樂創造情感，而是以　藥創造其倫理之格，　於倫理道德的構成，所以其社會之一切藝術，遂亦有所憑藉而具有其獨立之體態，於是有首，有腹，有尾，多是超脫現實，和平，人格的表現，他的價値與其說着重在情感上，不如說是着重在人格上，即如鐘所以立武，竹所以立會，鼓所以立動，磐所以立辨是也，吾人之所以珍視吾人之打擊樂器者，其原因只在於此，就時代說，中國　樂的貧弱，己經被其時代之洪流所吞沒無遺，阿當夏羅穆夫先生，拾起了久經被人遺忘的東西，給與他豐富的情感，時代的力量，使得一種中國獨具的語言，（音樂是世界的語言）變爲世界的語言，的確是一件値得珍視的事。孟姜女樂的章如果再行加强其主調的創造，俾使其性格更形有力，或更格外鮮明了。</p>
<p>關於動作方面，我以爲藝術家的眼睛裏，對於他的一切表現介體，絕無新舊優劣之分，因爲一切新的東西，多半是從舊的變化而來，藝術家所要愼重考慮的是力量的均衡，色調的協和，尺度的遠近，節奏的快慢，就動作來說，節奏，線條是牠力的表現介體，這種節奏，能與音樂，裝置，劇文，及其他有關各方面取得一致的協和，必然是成功的。中國固有戲劇同印度的戲劇相同之點甚多，主要的是動作，前年在重農曾與甘歌利先生交換意見，他對於中　戲劇之以動作代表文字之處，深爲贊美，我以爲在戲劇上，有就己已有之長，再行作進一步發展之必要，因爲在藝搜，牠還是一種新的啓示呢。從前在岳飛的演出上，曾作動作上協和與不協和的表現，與音樂的和聲作均衡的發展，其功能有的時候超過音樂，因爲動作畢竟較音樂鮮明的多。孟姜女實際執行導演任務的是陳鍾兄，曾經費過不少的苦心，都看得出來，仍然希望他們更行努力，俾使賓主分明，有了高潮，能够使圖案的變化，再行增多，動，靜，的運用再行得體，以加強其性格之創造，那麼對於固有藝術之新的協和介紹，當可在現代劇壇上立下獨立創造之規模矣。</p>
<p>在裝置上，其風格大體亦頗協和，惟仍應加强每一幅圖畫之重心，使一切的升華作用都超越現實，都有所本。</p>
<p>在服飾上，亦頗華麗，看不出大的毛病，如能不固守史實，根據史實在線條色彩上加重性格之表現或更形鮮豔些。</p>
<p>劇文方面，全劇對話似應改爲詩體，其句讀不必就固有的在陰陽平上去入上去因襲，（舊劇如是）而應當在輕說，與重說方面，就情感去創造，至於在全劇的結構上，每一幕的高潮，以及全劇高潮，都應加强力量，使其成爲立體的格體，以容納所有的技法。</p>
<p>我想道一切問題在她已樹立了一個難能可貴的規模的現在，是很容易改動的，因爲這都是些枝節的問題了‘</p>
<p>從政治上的而要，以及藝術哲學上的觀點而論，不能不說孟姜女的演出，是一個最堪珍視的工作，因爲在同一的原則之下，我們古代偉大的史詩，與夫一切文化與藝術上之退跡，均可借此以與國內外人士有進一步表達的機會了，雖則這一種創造，在我們自己也不是不能把握，而音樂藝術的修查，畢竟是一種天才的任務，並需長時間去努力的，阿富夏羅穆夫，在中國已有三十年之歷史，他爲藝術事業來工作，是値得歡迎的，韓德爾Handel是德國人，寄居英國，而得名，其米賽亞神劇，因受英王之祟敬，傳爲世界之美談，蕭邦Chopin是波蘭人，也是寄居法國而成名，因爲藝術是人類共有的財產。一至於在戲劇的情節方面，看得出來秦始皇是個自私自利不顧一民衆饑苦，只圖達到萬世基業屬一於一家之慾望，而作此殘暴無道違背大衆的舉動，將人民的一切加以破壞，以爲一人一姓作犧性，而修建萬里長城，那麼萬喜良一孟姜女不過是全民中之一代表而已，受其害者固家家如此，如果正視現實，那麼在此次大戰之後一，全世界人民正在苦痛不堪的時候，各國均苦於再以全力去擴充軍備，則此劇對於挽救和平挽救世人不能不說是一個最有意義的貢獻了，因爲她最可珍視的地方，是以藝術之格來格人的。</p>

<h3>裸女</h3>
<p>— 戴拉克窪</p>
<p>戴拉克窪（E.Deracroin　1798-1864）是法國初期古典主義作家達維的學生中的叛徒，他不但沒有承繼他的老師，而且另樹一幟的劍立了浪漫派，使畫壇起了一個極大的革命，啓迪了後代建立了繪畫理論。作風新穎，色彩複雜，取材以傳奇神話史制爲多，「但丁渡舟」即其代表作之一。這幀裸女，是以當時宮廷中的一個婢女作模特兒的。筆調簡潔而結實（獅）</p>
<h3>琴師</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>淹冬胡同在北平西城，最詳細的地圖也不載它的名字的。僻靜的街坊，除開牆角彎幾株棗樹外，署季，只聽見售水菓的挑子——那有韻律的銅　敲打聲。冬夜，穆斯克斯悠長的呌唱着：「阿羅羊月……」</p>
<p>胡同的西向盡端，是城根，騾車道永遠那般灰撲撲的，旣深而厚；烏鴉們成　結集在電綫上，城頭的荒草間。唯有那魚白色的天，是視綫下的適宜景緻。</p>
<p>尤其在秋日，我對這環境發生依變。我時常携帶一根便於作防身武器的搽漆手杖，漫步到城根附近來遊覽。我很奇異自己不知爲了什麼動機，對這等灰色的景　房然起着遊覽的興趣。</p>
<p>中秋後一天，我循照舊路，走到城牆下面，打算再向北前進一程，找那可以上城去觀光的石級。我遇見一個穿藍布大掛的矮胖子，饅首似的頭剃得很光凈，右手托　用荷葉承住的幾片豆腐，左手提了一隻香油瓶，對我笑笑地說：</p>
<p>「六爺，你真是怪趣兒，幹嗎逛到這來啦？」</p>
<p>我可住他瞧了半嚮。</p>
<p>「你忘記我了吧，」他做出一個昻藏的樣子，給痰嗆了一下，說。「你沒聽過話區子裘面拉的什麼，多少！我就住在你大爺家斜對面。」</p>
<p>哦，是了，他姓祁，一個琴師。每天傍晚，從對面院裏發出來那幽逸的胡琴聲，就是從他手邊傳到我耳裏來的。由於對藝術所生的感應，我不禁將自己那頑　的狀態改變了，帶着些懷慕的表情，說：</p>
<p>「是您呵！我那會不知道。您的手藝，豈只現在，我從小就領略的不少。現在可怎樣？」</p>
<p>「唉，不用提了吧。現在，現在，現在是一個沒事。「</p>
<p>「沒事？您不上戲院裏拉琴了嗎？」</p>
<p>「兩年沒幹這差事啦。」</p>
<p>老祁的眼有些發陰，像一朶愁雲　地遮住他的心境。的確，我也聰人說，這一年，他只受過一處冷靜地方——賓宴華樓幾位票友的邀請，他從前的光燄不知消失到那裏去了。他成了馬路上那些「三人　」（Trio）的凡亞鈴奏手，有時，找一個伴搭也費勁了呢。是老　了？或爲了別的原因，離失了老　們的靑睞了？</p>
<p>「合不上帮了，六爺。他們新，——自家兒說新，把咱們看作舊。習的老閩也愛新，編新調，走哈爾濱，跑香港，上海。剩下我這　不變不動的，一是捨不得北平的煤麵便宜，一又是家有老母。我就這麼潦倒下來，可不活該馬？</p>
<p>「您太自謙，開班子招生就是。」</p>
<p>「那裏的話！說容易，說也不容易……」</p>
<p>老祁似乎驀地生出不愉快的念頭，托着豆腐，經我身旁走了過去，不幾步，收尾說：</p>
<p>「明兒格見！」</p>
<p>這一次離開北平是一九三三年，爲的去找幾個朋友辦一椿小事，誰知四年之後，我仍舊回到僻靜的故居來了。我仍舊住在前院——窗旁有兩株棗樹的那間房。我開始了作一種編輯工作——根據凡本原文，給近代的主要批評潮流，摘取它的大意，寫成一本册子。</p>
<p>我希望在那國淡的角落間，恢復早年的靈感，寫詩的散文。但我己聽不見那一股雅逸的胡琴聲。這在過去無日不令我發生懷舊，空想，失眠的琴聲，從茲竟沉寂，不由他猜度着——呵，老祁，你沉寂了……你不是丟棄藝術，或者他遷了？</p>
<p>僕人老田吿知我說，當一次問他之際：</p>
<p>「老祁坐牢啦，現在還沒出來。前年他開小　賣店，虧耗幾百；回老家賣地皮，又打上了官事。官事打輸，就給……嗐，可惜，那一手好西皮！」</p>

<h3>伏爾泰</h3>
<p>— 幹四</p>
<p>一七一一七年法國大文豪伏爾泰到英國的時候，發現英國人正在非常痛恨法國人，所以在倫敦街道上行走，乃是一件對於他生命都會發生危險的事。某日他正在散步，有一羣憤怒的英國人火聲呼喊道：「殺死他，吊死這個法國人！」</p>
<p>伏爾泰立定了脚，面對着　　，大聲說道：「諸位英國人！你們要殺死我，因爲我是一個法國人！可是我不幸而不能做一個英國人，這處罰不是已經够嚴重了嗎？」</p>
<p>羣衆聽了不禁發在地歡呼起來，便將幹伏爾泰安全送到他自四己的寓所裏去。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血120</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見爲什麼要到松島來？顯而易見，知道他的計劃，已經失敗了。他以爲可以利用黑龍會，一面可以消極地减輕掣肘的勢力，一面或許可以積極地獲到較多較確的消息，可以用來探取「七封秘緘」的秘密。誰知黑龍會反而給了他一個萍子，一個相當厲害的對手；而且，從這十幾小時的經過看來，如還是一個情魔，一種不易　脫的纏障。</p>
<p>從近衛府邸那裏，他看出了近衛這個貪功噬殺的魔星，沒有理想的那般容易對付。此外，他原也知道第五縱隊，相當厲害，然而却未夢想到其中竟有這等機警敏捷的人物。還有那個靑木長老，簡直是個不可思議的魔術家，竟能把握着形而上的樓力，左右我人的心理。現在還沒知道他們對於這次侵略戰的觀念如何，萬一竟是贊成吞併整個亞洲，想做世界盟主，同那些魔星一般思想，那樣，他們這種魔術團體，也是一個極大的阻力，換句話說，鶴見想要用自己和幾個同志的力量，來勾當這件揭露「秘械」的大事，却是等於緣木求魚了。</p>
<p>此外，聽聽萍子的口氣，東京的黨政軍商，派別很多，各有相當的勢力，並且把自己這小小的一個人物，來參加黑龍會的舉動，當了一篇文章，竟那麼小題大做起來；這，對於自己的計劃，　未動手，竟看得見，決定難以成功了。而且他這兩天體力上的消耗，也是叫他墮入灰心絕望的一個大因素。所以他暫時放下了一切，一溜烟跑到松島來。小源夫人和菊子，有着母親，愛人，和知己的混合溫情和瞭解，並且這地點和住宅的幽靜淸雅，足够消除心上的惡劣情境。</p>
<p>他　　了一會，呆想了一會，覺得俄了，便穿了拖鞋下樓。又是菊子首先發現鶴見下樓，她好像早早在樓梯下邊伺候着似的。她先向鶴見行了一個家常便禮，問他睡得可安穩，然後，用她不大不小，很甜脆的嗓子，向半開着的　房門內喊着，「媽，玉哥下樓來了。」小源夫人也在廚房裏答應　：「菊兒，快把佛堂的門打開。」接　就見那位六十過頭，而並不能鍾的老太太，從廚房裏趕了出來，一臉的慈祥笑容。</p>
<p>菊子當先，把佛堂門開了，側着身子讓過鶴見和母親進了佛堂。這是一間四舖栩榻米的小房間，裏面已經燃上了油燈和芝蘭香。正中小神籠上有一座佛像，下面供桌上有幾架鏡框，每一架裏有一張放大像片，其中一張是小源計多之的生前攝影，就是菊子的父親；一張是梅子的照片，鶴見的養生母親。</p>
<p>小源夫人和菊子陪着鶴見，在這佛堂裏行禮，祈福，然後才同着一路，走到起居室裏，從新大家見面，行禮，問候；却一點沒有嘮勞叨叨的瑣碎，菊子這時，拿出她的看家本領，先伺候鶴見坐下，然後照應下女上菜燙酒。這裏充滿了溫情：小源夫人跌坐在近窗口的地方，笑瞇瞇地瞧着鸛見吃酒，一邊說雨句客氣得不讓人難堪的話：「我好像有些預覺，今天無意上市裏去，也無意買了這點食品，你平日喜歡的小　魚，就不曉得你口味改了沒有……？」</p>
<p>菊子一杯一杯的　酒，偶然插進一兩句淸雅的笑話，「玉哥的口味，不大會變的；瞧他先一筷子就是魚片，第二筷子又是魚片，第三筷還是魚片哩。」</p>
<h3>贈梅蘭芳博士</h3>
<p>— 趙誠伯</p>
<p>七絕四首有序</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士，長書樂，善歌舞，爲當代菊部之雄。大戰時，陷敵中，求脫不得，蓄　拒演；去毀容吞炭，誓身報國者，不甚相遠。蓋唐樂人雷海靑之流亞歟？勝利後，開在申剃　演費宮人刺虎，一票價萬金，擦背摩肩，有若趨市。人劇雙完，其引人也宜矣！鏡張生農，每　烈女之貞；簫管空箱，更見關鄉之志。作七絕四首以美。</p>
<p>正是征人破　天，霓裳歌舞憶燈前；梨園自有傷心事，梅蛆　　已十年。</p>
<p>鬼火秋墳土萬坵，興亡如夢水長流；戰學莫謂無人老，博士如今也白頭。</p>
<p>紅粉靑衫報國情，鳩形鵠面恥偷生；善才死去龜年老，更有何人識姓名？</p>
<p>十年冷落　坊歌，今日廂樓笑語和；我乞　郞莫便老，中原仍是漢山河。</p>

<h3>哀棚戶</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>政出必行，我們竭誠擁護，當局有實幹精神，有賢明計劃，想做事，肯做事，我們也十分敬佩；而所有施政時所遭遇到的困難和阻撓，天地良心，我們更能理解而願寄以同情和支持的。不過，對於拆遷棚戶一事，我們想建議度過這個嚴冬，明春再來舉辦，就是說，延期兩個月後實行，不知這個　見，能邀淸聽否？</p>
<p>爲四百萬人的安全，犧牲四萬棚戶，即便不到這樣精確的程度，但市區建築，自有整個計劃，又何况這四萬棚戶絕非犧性，祇是請他們喬遷到非禁建區而已。所以原則上，我們絕對擁護，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>爲什麼要代請求展緩兩月實行呢？那實在茲於人道。今年一年，百業已感蕭條，中下階層，特別感到經濟上的壓迫，再加大寒地沍，殘冬臘尾，一拆一建，大興土木，不僅財力上平增負担，即人力上也感狼狽。假使你我是這四萬戶中之一，急景凋年，你我的情緒上將會蒙上一層怎樣悲楚的陰影呀！</p>
<p>人間味！我們最好能稍稍顧及一些！</p>
<p>自然，我們深知這次當局的愼重處事，又深知棚戶們必能服從功令，遵照辦理，決不致發生問題，也許我們太情感了一點，假使讓這批棚戶茍安渡過這個嚴冬，豈不更貼切人情嗎？</p>
<p>是婦人之仁罷！</p>
<h3>十年前今日在東京</h3>
<p>— 小麥</p>
<p>…記歷史上重要的一天…</p>
<p>十年前今日，蔣主席蒙難西安，事情經過十三天，才脫險返京，離陝前，蔣主席曾對張楊二氏訓話，句中有說：「此决西安事變，實爲中國五十年歷史絕續所關，亦爲中華民國存亡極火關鍵。」十年來的歷史，證實了這兩句「先知的」評語，並無誇大。</p>
<p>「雙十二」事變發生當時，筆者羈留東京，當時各方情景，歷今依稀記憶。</p>
<p>據文獻上記載，「雙十二事變」的發生時刻是在當天未明晨前五時。當晨西安電報局已被防軍監視，所以消息不能傳出。東京的第一次號外，記得是在常日晚報之前發刊過一次，那似乎是由南京發報過來的。據事後筆者所知，當時及以後各報社的電文，多有被日當局扣刪，所以剩下來的已短得無可再短。在下午五時左右晚報以後，還有某一家報社的號外。</p>
<p>仇者快</p>
<p>自此以後，一直到「十二·廿五」蔣氏脫險返京爲止，東京各大報社的駐華記者曾受總社的命令，作報導的競賽。甚至市內的外勤記者也拼命採訪外方面的反嚮。當時麻布區的中國駐日大使館及許世英大使，自然是第一個日標，但許氏守口如瓶，記者的一無所獲。據事後所知道的，日本東京的「霞個關」（外務省）與「三宅坂」（陸軍省），陸續所接獲的情報，堪與使館比美！</p>
<p>市內外勤記者寫無可寫，祀無可記時，當年東京異軍突起與「朝日」「每日」兩大霸主作「爭霸戰」的「讀賣新開」，居然採訪到留日學生的宿舍來了，某留東學生回答說：「我們所曉得的事情，和報紙上所記載的一樣多」這句話（有點像「外交辭令」，然而確是事實）想不到也刊在市聞版頭條，並且插了好幾張照片。</p>
<p>從十二日那晚上起，我淸楚地記得，東京的茶館，小飯館，和澡堂裏都以此爲話題，作爲聯天的中心。</p>
<p>日本軍政首要，對當時的情景，自然十分「關切」。筆者於十三日深夜偶然囚事坐「計時汽車」，路經日本外務省附近！看見他們尙燈火輝煌，有異於平。卞四日早上看報，才曉得常晚日本各方首要，在那裏有過四五小時的長會議，討論所謂「對策」，其貿一貫以道之二「看能否混水摸魚，趁勢撈一把」。</p>
<p>翌日日本海陸兩軍首腦且舉行聯席會議，決定如下兩個所謂「原則」：（一）必要時採取自衛之　備指置；（二）警戒面靜觀。這不是「摸魚」措置是作麼？當時的外相是有田，陸相是寺內，海相是永野。</p>
<p>事發後，許大使與日本當局之第一次正式接觸是十八日蔣鼎文氏自陝返洛以後的翌日，這一談，談了五十多分鐘。當時外相有田並且厚着臉皮的請求：「希望以私人資格，獲得關於西安事變的若干特殊消息」。</p>
<p>當年日本駐華大使是川越，但十二月五日則早因中日談判已吿一段落而離京住滬。至十九日，奉「外務省」訓令才由滬返京。不過無論川越在京在滬，東京方面在這十三天日所獲得的情報，問樣的迅速而詳細。</p>
<p>有趣的是土肥原這時務頭子所發表的觀感，他一淸二楚的說出露骨話：「日本對中國，實在應該急速從新檢討一番了」。</p>
<p>失望了</p>
<p>儘管外交辭令如何漂亮，報章社評如何滑頭，日本的軍閥當時之想大大小小也得趁勢撈一把却是不可否定的事貿。筆者還記得「雙十二」以後，東京的股票市塲，花紗布交易，和人造絲絲價之急瀉直下，就可證明日人心中想像中的是什麼。這豐不是在「如意算盤」上想兩方擴大衝突而釀成大戰嗎？</p>
<p>十二月廿五日晚，東京各報亦發號外，並且多附有蔣氏照片。當晚本係誕在歡之夜，但就在這一晚，許多財閥軍閥都大失所望了。因爲：他們所希望的已告幻滅。僅僅股票市傷上有些人撈了一把。</p>
<p>當夜許多留學生的確確狂歡了一晚，有些幾乎鬧個通宵。但他們說竟爲了慶祝什麼則成疑問。在那一夜裏，有幾個人曉得七個月以後即將開始的中日大戰，已埋下火藥綫和九年後勝利的種子呢？</p>
<h3>向孩子學習吧！</h3>
<h3>12與13</h3>
<p>— 默默</p>
<p>有人相信「十三」是個最不吉利的數目，原因是耶穌最後之晚餐，連殺耶穌的猶大在內，恰恰十三個人一席。</p>
<p>於是乎就有人說：「西安事變」當年之能和平解決，原因在乎事發日是「十二」而非「十三」。</p>
<p>但是他忘記了，從事發到解圍而至蔣公脫險飛出，所經過的日數，即自十二日到廿五日，恰恰是十三天！</p>
<p>又有人這麼說：在十一日晚上，邵元冲，楊虎城，陳誠……諸氏在西安吃的那一桌飯，是十三個人一席。於是乎十二日凌農，邵氏遭難。</p>
<p>而當晚的宴會，張學良「少帥」並沒有出席，後來不是獲請特赦了嗎？</p>
<p>邵元冲當晚住的是西安之「西京招待所」一百十三號房間。殉難地又是「十三」！</p>
<p>惟有端納氏於十三飛陝斡旋，這「十三」却是個好兆頭。</p>
<p>而今天，那「招待所」已把這染有歷史血痕的房間，改爲一百三十號了。</p>
<p>但阿拉伯字號碼寫來，仍是「十三」，不過「十三」後顯帶一個「零」，表示戾氣已消罷了！</p>
<p>〔12〕，多事之日</p>
<p>以月份而談，一年中的五月是紀念日最多的月份。但以日序而言，每月「十二日」，似是一個「多事之日」。</p>
<p>今天的十二日就是一例。十年前今天十二日，就有人鬧得天覆地翻，險些兒出大亂子。</p>
<p>其他各月份以十二日爲節日者，據筆者所知，尙有：</p>
<p>二月十二日，南北統一紀念三月十二日，孫中山先生逝世紀念。</p>
<p>四月十二日，民十三年淸黨紀念日。</p>
<p>十一月十二日孫中山先生誕生紀念。</p>
<p>十二月十二日，西安事變紀念。</p>

<p>— 陳中</p>
<p>我國一向是重男輕女，一般父母都把女兒認爲「人家」人，要是一且嫁了出去，那更是出門不認貨所謂「嫁出了的女兒，潑出了的水」。雖然我們在舊書籍上也能例外地看到重女的記載，但畢竟是例外。可喜的是近年來男女平權之說高唱以來，社會上對於女人已經側目而視，另眼相看了，尤其在都市中，最風光的還是女人，勢利的父母，重女更甚，女兒就是他們的搖錢樹，兒子才是沒有出息！</p>
<p>在上海華洋雜處的「上等」社會中，我們常常聽到「女人第一」—Ladies　First—這麼一個口號，居然中英對照，該是國際名言吧？所以信奉的人很多：抽烟要經女人許可，看見女人得脫帽，上車下軍，入室出室，都請女人佔光，連幾個大學堂裏也是女學生第一，在講堂內坐在第一排，成了不可變易的習慎法。</p>
<p>國民大會代表，並沒有以年齡爲準而另定少代表老代表，但却別成一體的有婦女代表。難道婦女配不上做社會賢達和政黨代表……嗎？難道婦女代表單是因爲本身是婦女而才作代表的嗎？想來也是受了「女人第一」的影響。「女人第一」究竟是侮辱女人還是尊敬女人？</p>
<p>「女人第一」這個風氣十足道地的來自歐美，咱們中國人不過是照樣「拷貝」却不知道「女人第一」在歐美就是一個矛盾。</p>
<p>以英文來舉例吧：除了演講的時候Ladies　and　Gentlemen一語，其中女人在先外。假如寫信給王先生和王太太，他們在信上總寫Ｍr．and　Mrs．Wang而不寫Mrs．and　Mr．Wang女人在後，此其一也。在文章上，尤其是美國人常喜歡用He　or　She或His　or　her總是男性在上，女性在下此其二也。至於「人類」一字在英文爲Mankind而不是Ｗomankind，可見男人足以代表人類，而女子則不足。稱「人」曰Human　Being而不稱Huwoman　Being也是同樣情形。語言本是代表民族國家的主要特徵，在英美（女人第一的發祥地）尙且有這許多矛盾可見；邊論其他？</p>
<h3>大可樂觀</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>甲：「聽說下一次世界大戰如果爆發，戰爭將要決勝於比原子彈更兇的細菌武器了！」</p>
<p>乙：「噢！幸運極了！在下一次世界大戰以後，中國一定是名符其實的强國了！」</p>
<p>甲：「何以見得？」</p>
<p>乙：「不是嗎？中國多的正是細菌哩！」</p>
<h3>寓言</h3>
<p>— 國鴻</p>
<p>某日，一個年輕力肚的靑年忽然生了奇症。他左手打右手，右手打左手，打得皮爛肉開，但是他仍然愈打愈有勁。旁人搖搖頭，不解。</p>
<h3>牛乳和餅乾　福薄難消受</h3>
<p>— 蕭</p>
<p>國大代表移點心費振濟南京難民，振濟物品中有着「牛乳」和「餅乾」。</p>
<p>但是很奇怪，難民倒不希罕「牛乳和餅乾」，却要求發給『大餅油條」—難道牛乳和餅乾不及大餅油條的「營養」嗎？倒也使人有些疑惑！</p>
<p>論理，飢不擇食，那有不要餅乾要大餅之理？猜想起來，恐怕是飽不飽的問題。牛乳餅乾雖然芳名可愛，但每人所得之量，未必比兩塊大餅，兩個油條更實惠呢！</p>
<h3>哭毛毯</h3>
<p>— 夢仙</p>
<p>「毛毯不知何處去？老天依舊刮西風」。已成了多數公敎人員的感嘆。但是公敎人員，寗可望穿淚眼，還是希望毛毯去而復來。</p>
<h3>羊毛毯飮泣呼冤</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>請澈查真相</p>
<p>爲公敎人員通緝羊毛毯歸案法辦一案，會佈諸八日本刊。實含寃莫伸，苦衷難宣；通緝令下，惶恐奚如！爲此不得不將下情，向公務人員等辯訴如下。伏祈垂鑒，以期沉寃大白—澈查眞相，藉明責任所在！</p>
<p>竊羊毛毯蠶身有契，議價有據；原期永作公敎人員終身陪侍，白頭偕老，以示溫存—，詎料原媒物資供應機構，心存回測，中途起意，以羊毛毯稍其姿色，價賣平康；非出自動，實乃被逼！身不由主，含此沉寃！未敢有遠信義，而生貳志！實出原媒翻戲，從中漁利！</p>
<p>今羊毛毯失身於人，白璧有玷！人言可畏，極願跳出火坑！曾數向原媒交涉，誠意從良（公敎人員），奈刁媒作祟，竟以高價贖身相誘脅！以羊毛毯弱不禁風之姿，非敢匹敵；祇得含寃飲泣，有誰矜憐？如公敎人員等眷念羊毛毯之溫存多情？不妨訴刁媒背的之嫌，拐騙羊毛毯墮入平康之罪！一旦公審有日，羊毛毯當到堂作證，藉懲奸刁，以抒羣憤，合亟泣寃如上，幸乞澈查，實爲辛甚！</p>
<p>美國毛毯謹啓</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>叫花子的組織　18</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謹</p>
<p>真假旅客</p>
<p>本地丐幫膠着在上海市面，雖努力求生，無孔不入；但終年蓬頭垢面，菜色鳩形。殊非丈夫之志。於是一般少壯之流，決意另覓蹊徑，實規其「男兒志在四方」的本色。此輩丐流，抱着遠大志願，居然遠走高飛，開始其旅行生涯。這便是丐幫中所謂「撩風箏」的新路綫。但是此種生路，仍舊不脫詐欺手法。「撩風箏」乃是走舟軍之謂。上海交通利便，水陸路綫，密如蛛綱。本幫丐流，却能利用時會，可以常川來往各處而不費分文。而且每次出門，都有「撩扒」（　錢也）的把握。非有獨當一面的真本領，怎能夠赤手成家呢？</p>
<p>船上表演</p>
<p>此輩每日　充旅客乘船，衣冠却相當整潔，不露　三本色。等到客齊船開，於是開始其哭笑兼有的本領、先向鄰座的旅客寒喧問訊，漸漸地談及己事，於是信口捏造過去的身份，如原在故鄕從商，不料突來患難，店業破產，妻亡子散。好像人生苦痛，都叢集於一身。於是問船旅客圍聚問訊，恭聆他的演說。中國人向來　厚成性，尤其是旅中多暇，好管閒事。大家萍水相逢，格外惑到親切。不久十百相傳，大家不免都引起惻隱之心。丐流認爲良機莫失，要乞求大衆佈施。這時大家便會慷慨解囊。片刻間集數已有可觀。等到查票員前來，查得無票。衆旅客便會爲他求情，予以優待。於是丐流不但免費乘船，而且滿載而歸。明天另乘一條輪船回滬，又可以依樣葫蘆，再來一次悲劇搬演了。久後不免被船員看穿伎倆，於是不得不施賄賂以塞彼輩之口。有時甚至需分配潤澤，方可無事。但是無論如何，祇需一月旅行幾次，那收入的總數，却遠勝於鄭躅街頭的同輩多多了。</p>
<p>此類「撩風箏」的活劇，以川走長江的輪船上最多。其次爲川走寗波紹興的海輪上。原來上海寗紹同鄕會，定有規章對於流落滬上的窮苦同鄉，得由同鄕會　予回里船　。丐流　充同鄉前來，但志不在船票，而在　到一封介紹信。信中註明回里後可向某處領洋兩元（戰前之實况）。而在船上又可恃精彩表演而得厚利。維想到同鄕會的優待辦法，反造成了丐流的滑頭生意呢？</p>
<p>車站活劇</p>
<p>除了水路的「海裏山」（輪船也）外，問樣還活動於火軍站上。幫中人呼火車爲「飛百脚」。但在火車上却不能回座客求助，因爲同車客的感情極爲淡薄，比不到「同舟共濟」的船上客來得親切。而且一張四等車票也決賴不掉。他們須到目的地下車後，在車站上旅客擁　　車時，再開始其哭笑的表演伎倆。要求旅客們資助。一個車站上每天有好幾班客車來往着。旅客也源源不斷，丐流可以一天在甲站上活動，次日却又乘車到乙站上去。雖然風塵僕僕，跋涉辛苦。但入款却很可觀。這便是「撩風箏」幫出碼頭的新路綫。</p>
<h3>假使我辦一個黨</h3>
<p>— 谷</p>
<p>假使我辦一個黨，首先，我一定取一個最好的名字：「平等自由民主黨。」也許有人以爲這個名字太長，但因爲要切合實際的需要，一定得如此。</p>
<p>然後，我必需發表一篇宣言，表示本黨是在民間成長起來的，所以，我們一定能代表眞正的民意。本黨的政策是基於「平等自由民主」的，所以一定處處爲人民着想。這篇宣言不必長，但「人民」兩字必需儘量多說。</p>
<p>只要稍微有了些「幹部」，那我一定聲稱本黨黨員遍佈全中國，數額大得驚人——驚如說，本黨已有黨員二萬萬零一個人。這樣，可以證明本黨是代表了「大部份」的「民意」。</p>
<p>有了這樣大數額的黨員，當然應該做些事情，因爲本黨的宗旨是「一切爲人民」呀！</p>
<p>因此，我就向政府請求在國府組織裏，　　任用我們的黨員。行政院院　要，立法院院長要，小此的姐　政　部長，也要！應多愈好。不　寫文章的時候，則應調一句話：「甘爲　　恥　二官。」</p>
<p>政府答應，那麼做了官再說；（本黨是有進取的情神的！）似使不能盡如人意，那麼，這是　政府不民主，我們自行組織可也。</p>
<p>我的黨一定飛黃騰達，黨員一定　有官做，而且，「一切爲人民」！　員「不宜」？</p>
<h3>雙十二話西安</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>西安話有許多方音成份，外地人聽來相當有趣。西安人間「什麼地方」曰一亞打」（　　），有如滬地某襯衫之商標。又西安稱那裏曰「烏打」（ua）則一如日人姓氏「宇田」之以音。他如稱「頭」曰「多啦」或「剎」，亦極有趣。</p>
<p>長安之「我」字，普通有三讀音，一曰「兀　（ngo），一如廣東語之「我」二日「兀　」（ngai），依筆者所知，珠江三角口方首亦有此讀音。三曰「×丫」（wa），與日人古語稱我曰「　」之讀作wa者完全相同。此三讀音在語音學上頗有考究之價値。</p>
<p>西安有某西藥房之電話號碼爲「六〇六」，其支店之號碼爲「九一四」。</p>
<p>西安有電影院曰「阿房宮」，有人問他老　，何哞放映「火燒阿房宮」這部影片？</p>
<p>西安秋末冬初有一價廉物美之小食，曰「杮子餅」，併用熟透之紅杮搗爛和麺粉再用滾油炸香，味美，不讓西點之「熟餅」，粵點之「　　糕」也。</p>
<p>一週前筆者在街上看到一老鄉，鼻子塗紅色，身披羊毛表而反穿，讓白羊毛露在外頭。且倒騎在　子上即以人背朝　頭，人面朝　屁股。最堪發笑者則肩際尙用紅綫掛一尿壺（當然是全新的！）。輸之前，並有數人吹吹打打及手捧敬神茶菓點心之類，聞係老夫初生兒矛酬神的風尙。但此公是按諸西安習俗，抑或他鄕移來，則未經考究，不敢妄斷。</p>
<p>西安新婚鬧房，種種惡劇，半數以上係半誘半就的讓一對新人當衆接吻，可吃知「胭脂」並非　來品也。</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」係描寫西京量物，其中不少地名寺院名至今尙存者。如實玉嫂王鳳姐外家開設之富店，書中再三提及係在「鼓樓」旁之「西大街」，此一建築物與街名，迄今尙在，且爲市中心十字馬路之一，但「　樓」無鼓者久矣。樓上僅有一巨大扁額，題曰「聲聞於天」抗戰至今，樓上裝設有空製警報器一具，不謀而合。</p>
<p>西安最低級之妓院地區，「鴨子坑」，一如他處呼妓女曰「野鷄」，粵人曰「貓窟」者無異，妓女非人而　家禽，則一也。某公作「鴨子坑吟」，茲節錄數行如左：</p>

<h3>Debate Opens on the Capital Issue; Applause Resounds in the First Review Committee; Zhang Ji Firmly Supports Establishing the Capital in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The capital issue, which has attracted the most attention in the draft constitution, unfolded into heated debate on the 11th in the First Review Committee. Zhang Ji acted as the vanguard for those advocating establishing the capital in Beiping, while Liu Baimin was put forward as the speaker for those advocating establishing the capital in Nanjing. Social notable Chou Ao put forward a third proposal, suggesting establishing it in the most challenging location of Xi'an. Each presented eloquent arguments, deliberating for nearly two hours from 4:15 PM to 6:00 PM without reaching a final conclusion. It was decided to continue the discussion at 9:00 AM on the 12th, where another fierce debate is anticipated. Zhang Zhiben announced the discussion of the seventh article of the general outline, the capital issue, immediately after the discussion of the national flag issue. The entire hall burst into applause, the atmosphere shifting from silence to enthusiastic discussion. Zhang Jiyan, the Liaoning representative advocating establishing the capital in Beiping, was the first to speak, believing this issue was about "determining the capital" rather than "establishing the capital." He hoped everyone would follow their conscience and consider the nation and people first. He then pointed out the advantages of establishing the capital in Beiping from a historical perspective, using the Ming and Qing dynasties as examples to illustrate that establishing the capital in Beiping would allow the country to enjoy long-term peace and stability. In contrast, the Liang Dynasty of Emperor Wu and the Republic of China in Nanjing faced many internal and external troubles. Geographically, Beiping is also more advantageous for defense, unlike Nanjing which is easily threatened. He also explained that the Japanese coveting the Northeast was due to our government being far away in Nanjing, unable to attend to North China, let alone take care of the Northeast, which led to the September 18th Incident. The next to speak was Chou Ao. Although he was from Hunan, he considered the overall situation and strongly advocated establishing the capital in Xi'an. His reason was that our people should choose the most challenging and needy location for the capital. The Northwest is becoming increasingly desolate, with a declining population. We should not be greedy for the comfort of Nanjing or Beiping and forget the Northwest. Please do not forget the ancient saying of "born in sorrow, die in peace." At this point, Zhang Ji, a veteran of the party and the nation, spoke, and the entire hall applauded warmly. Zhang first explained that the capital is the most important and concrete issue in the entire constitution, hoping not to act impulsively. This matter is not a North-South dispute, nor a party dispute. The Kuomintang has not made a decision on this, so there is complete freedom of discussion. He analyzed the proposals related to the capital issue, believing that only a very small number supported establishing the capital in Nanjing, while the vast majority favored establishing the capital in Beiping, hoping not to go against the will of the people. Zhang explained the original intention of Sun Yat-sen's proposal to establish the capital in Nanjing, stating: "I can say with certainty that Sun Yat-sen's proposal to establish the capital in Nanjing was a temporary matter, not permanent. In terms of environment and reality, I support establishing the capital in Beiping. Some oppose establishing the capital there because it is close to powerful neighbors, fearing it is unsafe. However, we should know the ancient saying of "born in sorrow, die in peace." The more dangerous it is, the more we should move there. Even our military authority General Chen Cheng and others recently shared this view during discussions. If we establish the capital in Nanjing again, we will inevitably perish." After these words, the audience applauded greatly. He Sui, the original proposer of not specifying the location of the capital in the constitution, spoke, believing that the constitution is permanent and should not include the fluid issue of the capital. In this atomic age, if there is a war, Nanjing must move its capital, and Beiping will have to move as well. It is better not to specify it. The Hebei representative refuted establishing the capital in Nanjing with a humorous tone, stating: "Sun Yat-sen established the capital in Nanjing because the feudal colors were too strong, the warlord forces were deeply rooted, and there were foreign forces. Currently, all of the above have been swept away. Moreover, the representatives of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces have jointly signed this proposal, which shows that it is not just the opinion of the northern representatives." He argued that there are not many houses, and government agencies can operate in Beiping after the relocation. He also explained that even if there are practical difficulties, the constitution will not be implemented immediately after the decision, but will be delayed. Sun Chunwu, the Beiping representative, and Qi Bihou, the Suiyuan representative, spoke on behalf of 200 million people of three nationalities, advocating establishing the capital in Beiping. Wu Xiaodao, based on border and national defense reasons, advocated establishing the capital in Nanjing and explained the difficulties of moving the capital, arguing that deciding but temporarily not moving is equivalent to writing a blank check. He Yangling said that the charter stipulates establishing the capital in Nanjing, and all parties have agreed, and explained that history is not a strong proof of establishing the capital in Beiping, while the three revolutionary governments of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Xiuquan, and Sun Yat-sen all established the capital in Nanjing. Ren Zhuoxuan believed that the capital is one matter, and foreign troubles are another. Establishing the capital in Beiping has also resulted in loss of power and humiliation. This matter should be blamed on the government, not on the location. Liu Baimin refuted Zhang Ji's theory, believing that Sun Yat-sen not only temporarily advocated establishing the capital in Nanjing, but also had a plan for permanently establishing the capital in Nanjing in his industrial plan. Nanjing is truly the revolutionary capital, and please remember the story of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese. The heated debate continued until 6:00 PM. Those requesting to speak were still eager, so it was decided to continue the discussion on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Second Review Committee Passes Resolution: Defining the National Assembly's Powers; The National Assembly is the Highest Organ for Exercising Political Power</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Second Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its fourth plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th in the Assembly Hall. 257 representatives attended. Chairman Zhang Qiang first reported that the work of organizing the proposals had not yet been completed and deeply apologized. Shao Lizi then suggested saving time by not compiling and organizing the extensive opinions, and proposed that the proposals be discussed immediately and voted on quickly after the organizing work was completed. Kong Geng and others immediately objected, saying that not only should the extensive opinions from the past be compiled and organized, but extensive discussions should continue. Thus, the representatives spoke one after another until the meeting was adjourned at 11:50 AM.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:40 PM in the Assembly Hall. 211 representatives attended, chaired by Zhu Hongru. They began discussing the third chapter, "National Assembly," of the constitutional draft article by article. Most representatives argued that the nature of the National Assembly must be defined. Although Shao Lizi and Tao Xisheng strongly advocated discussing the constitutional draft as it was, the assembly still passed a motion to add "The National Assembly is the highest organ for the people of the Republic of China to exercise political power" at the beginning of the chapter, as Article 26. The original Article 26 was moved to Article 27, and was partially amended to "The National Assembly shall be composed of the following representatives: (1) Each county and city, and areas of equal status, shall elect one representative, and an additional representative shall be elected for every 300,000 people. (2) The number of representatives from the Mongol leagues, Tibet, and minority nationalities shall be determined by law." The provisions for legislative and supervisory committee members to be representatives of the National Assembly were all deleted. The provisions for representatives of overseas Mongols and overseas Chinese were left for further discussion on the 12th due to insufficient time. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Review Work Completed on the "President" Chapter of the Constitutional Draft</h3>
<p>The Third Review Committee Continued its Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its forty-first plenary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th, with 112 representatives attending. Shi Shangkuan, Chairman, continued to discuss the articles of the "President" chapter of the constitutional draft. Article 44 was amended to "In the event of a national emergency, natural disaster (the words "plague and epidemic" were deleted), or a major change in national finance or economy, requiring immediate action, the President may, during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, issue emergency decrees based on the decision of the Executive Yuan Council and in accordance with the Emergency Decree Law, and take necessary measures, but must submit them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after the issuance of the order. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the emergency decree shall immediately become invalid." In addition, Articles 45 to 53, totaling nine articles, were passed to maintain the original text. The review work of the fourth chapter was completed at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] When the Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its third meeting on the 10th, it made a detailed discussion on the articles of the fourth chapter, "President." In addition to Articles 36, 37, 40, 42, and 43, totaling five articles, being passed as is, Article 38 was discussed extensively due to its broad content. Article 39 was amended to "The President shall exercise the power to conclude treaties and declare war and make peace in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution (the five characters "Article 63" were deleted)." Article 41 was amended to "The President shall exercise the power to (the two characters "amnesty" were deleted) (grant pardons, reduce sentences, and restore rights) in accordance with the law (the entire sentence "The Minister of Judicial Administration shall submit the foregoing matters regarding pardons, sentence reductions, and restorations of rights to the President in accordance with the law" in the second paragraph was deleted)." Article 44, due to the issue of the Legislative Yuan recess, did not immediately reach a result. To be discussed on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Premier of the Executive Yuan Vacant, Deputy Premier to Act as Proxy</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Third Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Third Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft continued its meeting in the First Lounge at 3:40 PM, with 109 representatives attending, still chaired by Shi Shangkuan. The review work of the fifth chapter, "Executive," of the draft constitutional amendment was started. Articles 54 and 55 were successfully passed. Article 56 was passed after an hour of heated discussion, based on the amendment proposed by Wang Shijie, adding the provision that the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act as proxy during the absence of the Premier. It was amended to "The Premier shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. During the recess of the Executive Yuan, if the Premier resigns or is absent, the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act as proxy, but the Legislative Yuan must be convened within 40 days to submit a candidate for the Premier for consent. Before the candidate for the Premier nominated by the President is approved by the Legislative Yuan, the Deputy Premier shall temporarily act as proxy." Article 57 was amended to include the appointment of the Deputy Premier, and amended to "The Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of the ministries and commissions, and the ministers without portfolio shall be appointed by the President upon the nomination of the Premier of the Executive Yuan." At 5:20 PM, the discussion of Article 58 began. There was extremely fierce dispute over the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan on certain matters. By the time the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, no conclusion had been reached. It was decided to continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th to continue the discussion.</p>
<h3>Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department: Answering Questions on Constitution-Making</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Central Propaganda Department will hold a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at 2:00 PM on the 13th at the Chongqing Anle Hall on Zhongshan East Road. Qingniantuan Zu Shunsheng will be invited to answer questions regarding the constitution-making by the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>"Double Twelfth" Anniversary: No Expanded Ceremonies in Lintong and Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 11th] This reporter returned from Lintong early this morning, along the way, the biting north wind and frost made the cold comparable to the snowfall on this morning ten years ago. The Lintong Valley Military Officers' Corps has no special plans for expanded ceremonies on the 12th to commemorate this turning point in Chinese national history ten years ago. Xi'an also has no expanded commemorative ceremonies on the 12th, presumably to be held together on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Article 1 of the General Outline of the Constitutional Draft: "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People" Passed by Majority of the First Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Article 1 of the General Outline of the Constitutional Draft was put to a vote again at the fourth meeting of the First Review Committee on the 11th. With 153 people present, it was passed by a majority of 107 votes, amended to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People." However, the Qingniantuan representative Chang stated in public that since the case had been passed by an absolute majority, the minority party did not intend to express further opinions in the meeting, but reserved the right to speak, so as to speak in the general assembly. The MinSheDang also reserved the right to speak on Article 1. Article 2 of the Constitutional Draft originally read: "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people," was also changed to "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire nation" by a majority of 116 votes. The original Article 3, "Those with the nationality of the Republic of China are citizens of the Republic of China" was passed unanimously without dissent.</p>
<p>The first review meeting was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:45 AM on the morning of the 11th. Zhang Zhiben was the chairman, discussing how to deal with the issue of Article 1 of the General Outline, which was voted on at yesterday's meeting but did not pass the majority. At that time, opinions could be divided into two factions. Qingniantuan Min Da, Zhou Dou San, and others advocated sending the results of yesterday's discussion to the Comprehensive Committee for review. Jiang Wanping and others seconded, but most representatives generally advocated re-examining various opinions at today's meeting, based on Article 50 of the National Assembly Rules of Procedure, "If the result of the vote is still inconclusive, and if it is an issue that cannot be abandoned, it should be submitted for review again." Min Da and others believed that the second review was illegal, insisted on submitting it to the Comprehensive Committee, and once expressed their intention to withdraw. The atmosphere at the meeting was quite tense. Li Junfu of the MinSheDang rose to explain "the opinions of most people inside and outside the meeting," but before he could finish, dozens of representatives stood up to speak, the order was extremely chaotic, but Huang Shaogu, one of the conveners, spoke loudly, explaining the situation, and said "It is a pity that this kind of misunderstanding has been caused," and the meeting returned to calm. The vote should send to the comprehensive committee, and only seventy-one of the one hundred and fifty-four people present at the time agreed, which was less than half. However, in order to avoid involving political issues and to maintain harmony at the meeting, a reverse vote was taken again. Eighty-two people agreed to continue the discussion, and the review continued. First, it was decided to vote on the two proposals with the most votes. "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People" received only 33 votes and was rejected. "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People" passed with a majority of 107 votes, and the entire hall applauded.</p>
<p>At this point, Wu Yanhuan, the Hebei representative, rose to speak and said: "I am a member of the Kuomintang and I am willing to reconcile with the facts and not quibble over words." Qingniantuan representative Min Da Zheng Gong stated: "Since this issue has been voted on and the supporters accounted for an absolute majority, the minority party's opinion does not intend to be expressed in the meeting, but reserves the right to speak, so that they can speak in the general assembly." Those present applauded in agreement with this spirit.</p>
<p>After the passage of this important Article 1, the representatives calmly continued to discuss Article 2. The original text of this article was "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire people." The representatives put forward a total of nine amendments to the case, which can be summarized into major categories, the most important change being the proposal to change the words "people" to "nation." Qingniantuan Xia Erkang recognized that "people" and "nation" are different and cannot be considered as one. Zhou Zhi Shan, the Jiangsu representative, said: If "people" is used, it will be inconsistent with the foregoing and Article 3, and pointed out that the provisional law of the Republic of China stipulated "belonging to the nation." Jiang Wanping, a professional representative, also recognized that we came to the meeting as national representatives, why not use "nation." Ren Zhuoxuan recognized that foreign overseas Chinese reside in our country and enjoy the rights of the people, but they have not obtained nationality and are not our citizens, so they are not a source of sovereignty, and sovereignty should come from citizens who have obtained nationality.</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan said: The constitutional draft used "people" instead of "nation" because of its reasons. At the same time, sovereignty resides in the nation, and it is easy to turn the theory of people's sovereignty into national sovereignty, and evolve into a German-style centralized country, hoping that the original drafter will explain. Wu Jingxiong rose to report, explaining the contract law and the Temple of Heaven Constitution, saying that according to the latter, sovereignty belongs to the "people," and pointed out the difference between belonging to the people and being transferred to the government, but recognized that this point should be paid to the right of the word in the end. Voting, 160 people were present at the time, and by a majority of 116 votes, the "people" was changed to "nation," and the full text was changed to "The sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the entire nation," and the entire audience also applauded unanimously.</p>
<p>After discussing Article 3, "Those who have the nationality of the Republic of China are citizens of the Republic of China", the entire audience unanimously agreed to maintain the original case without dissent, and the amendment was not discussed.</p>
<h3>The Constitution Addresses the Territory Issue: Passed Using a General Approach</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] How the constitution should address the territory issue was discussed in detail at the meeting of the First Review Committee on the 11th in the morning and afternoon, and by a majority vote, the original case "The territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed except in accordance with law based on its inherent territory" was amended to "The territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without the resolution of the National Assembly based on its inherent territory." Article 5 "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal" and Article 6 "The national flag of the Republic of China is determined to be a red background with a blue sky and white sun in the upper left corner" were briefly discussed and passed to maintain the original case.</p>
<h3>Sixth Review Committee Holds Fifth and Sixth Meetings</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Sixth Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft held its fifth and sixth meetings on the 11th, chaired by Gu Zhengding and Fang Shaoyun, respectively. A total of Articles 114, 116, 118, and 119 were passed throughout the day.

For Article 117, the convener asked the drafter to attend and explain on the 12th before discussing. Article 120 was decided to continue the discussion on the 12th and then reorganize.</p>
<h3>Seventh Review Committee: Work of Two Groups Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] In addition to the First National Defense Diplomacy and Fourth Social Security groups of the Seventh Review Committee of the Constitutional Draft having concluded their work, the Third Education and Culture Group held a reorganization group meeting at 9:00 AM, attended by Chuan Sinian, Lai Lian, and others, to summarize and reorganize the relevant proposals and various general opinions, actively carrying out the work, and only dispersing at 12:30 noon. The Second National Economic Group continued its meeting at 3:40 PM in the afternoon in addition to the morning meeting, with 88 representatives attending, still chaired by Liu Zhendong. According to the proposals of Wang Xiaolai and others, the following articles were discussed and passed to replace the provisions on agricultural land in the first half of Article 139 of the constitutional draft amendment: (1) "The land in the territory of the Republic of China belongs to all citizens. The ownership obtained by the people in accordance with the law shall be protected and restricted by law. Private land shall be taxed according to convenience, and the government may levy education according to price." (2) "Minerals attached to the land and natural forces that are economically available for public benefit belong to the state and are not affected by the ownership obtained by the people" (3) "The value of land that increases not due to the application of labor and capital shall be returned to the people for public enjoyment by collecting land appreciation tax" (4) "The state's distribution and reorganization of land shall be based on the principle of planting self-cultivating farmers and people who use land on their own." The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM. It was decided to hold a convener meeting at 10:00 AM on the 12th and a fifth group plenary meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

<h3>MinSheDang Issues Statement: Reserves Opinion on the Name of the Country: Requests the Comprehensive Committee to Resubmit for a Vote</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Jiang Yuntian, the spokesperson of the MinSheDang, issued a statement late on the 11th, saying: "At this evening's party meeting, based on the reports of the conveners of the various review committees of the constitutional draft, some resolutions were made. I am now ordered to make the following statement: (1) Today, the first review committee of the constitutional draft amended Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the constitutional draft to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and our party representative immediately made a written statement reserving the opinions of the minority. (2) Today, the third review committee of the constitutional draft added the four characters "emergency events" to Article 44 of Chapter 4 of the constitutional draft, and our party representative immediately stated that the opinions of the minority party would be reserved and submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee to request military payment for voting. If the opinions of the minority party cannot be respected and considered by the majority party, then our party will consider appropriate measures to participate in the constitution-making work." Jiang also said: "The third party people's news said that a small number of leaders of our party advocated implementing the Qing Party, which is absolutely not the case."</p>
<h3>The Stormy Waters of the Review Committee</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter</p>
<p>——Arguments, Withdrawals, and News Reporters Blocked</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] During the First Review Committee's discussion of Article One, a point raised regarding Ying Wugong's actions caused a huge uproar, with members of the Youth Party almost walking out. Min Da, Zhou Dou San, and others, wearing hats and carrying books, prepared to leave, but were dissuaded by other representatives. Li Junfu of the Democratic Socialist Party, who had requested to withdraw yesterday, again threatened to leave today because the representatives would not allow him to report, but was persuaded to stay by those nearby.</p>
<p>When discussing whether sovereignty belonged to the "people" or the "nation," a certain Guangdong representative and Wu Jingxiong had a lengthy discussion about the Queen of England, and Chen Guyuan spoke at length about the source of sovereignty, leading some to say that the meeting resembled a "Comparative Constitutional Law" class at a university.</p>
<p>Jiang Wanping's remarks were the most amusing. He said, "We are attending the National Assembly as representatives of the nation, so why does the constitution use 'people' instead of 'nation'?" The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Representative Wu Yanhuan said that territory must never be changed, and if there is any further loss of land, the ancestors in the afterlife will surely scold us for "not being good sons."</p>
<p>Female representative Guo Changhe shouted, opposing the enumerated method of defining territory, saying, "We must also recover our past lands, such as Hong Kong, and the national territory cannot be forfeited by this National Assembly!"</p>
<p>When the Second Review Committee convened, there was another "extensive discussion." Kong Geng spoke for over ten minutes, and Youth Party representative Zhu Ruixi stood up to ask Chairman Zhang Qiang to pay attention to speaking time. Old Man Kong was greatly angered, and his dozen or so cronies jumped up, rushing from all directions to surround Zhu's seat, pointing fingers and verbally attacking him, like a punitive expedition, almost resorting to violence. Chairman Zhang loudly called for "order," finally suppressing the situation of all-out fighting. With the sympathy of the majority, Representative Zhu sat silently for a while and then withdrew from the meeting. Old Man Kong again jumped onto the stage and said, "Just now, because a certain representative interfered with my right to speak, it caused chaos. This is truly a case of 'one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark in response'..." The audience listened with unease, and he began to deliver his "grand pronouncements" with head-shaking gestures.</p>
<p>Article 45 of the Presidential Chapter, regarding the President's power to convene meetings of the heads of relevant departments to resolve inter-departmental disputes, was already debated in the Political Consultative Conference's Constitution Drafting Review Committee, and the Democratic Socialist Party ultimately conceded. Unexpectedly, differing opinions arose again among the Kuomintang representatives in the Third Review Committee. Wang Shijie and Luo Ding advocated for deletion, while Pan Gongzhan advocated for retention. After a vote, the original proposal was maintained by a majority of forty-four votes, and Pan won the battle.</p>
<p>Representative He Fuqing from the Henan region again made a clever remark about a "prospective president," saying how it should be done. Representative Zhang Ziyang from Hebei immediately stood up, saying, "I oppose this representative's opinion. There is no need for a 'prospective president.' If we are going to elect a 'prospective president,' then we can also elect a 'honorary president' and so on!" As a result, it was put to a vote. The first time, only He himself voted in favor of the "prospective president." The second time, Li Jingzhai, who originally proposed the motion, smiled and raised his hand, and the clever proposal for a "prospective president" was declared over.</p>
<p>The First National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Seventh Review Committee suddenly refused reporters' attendance this morning. The reporter asked, "Is this a secret meeting? If so, we won't intrude." The "Military Police Lord" replied, "Don't you know? In any case, you are not allowed to enter." "Would it be alright for us to ask the staff?" "No, no news reporters are allowed to enter this door." "Then whose order is it? The platoon leader? The battalion commander? The section chief?" "None of them, it's the 'Higher Up'." Upon asking their "Higher Up," it turned out to be Chairman Leng Xin's silent order. After inquiring about the content of the discussion, it seemed very ordinary. No one could say it was a "national defense secret" or a "foreign affairs secret."</p>
<p>When Kong Geng was getting angry, Lai Lian came out from the Education and Culture Subcommittee meeting and stood in the lobby, observing. He smiled and shook his head. When the reporter looked at him, he quickly went back to the meeting.</p>
<p>Before the issue of the national capital was raised in the First Review Committee this afternoon, the whole audience applauded enthusiastically, as if it were before the start of a good show. Zhang Pu's long speech garnered more than thirty rounds of applause, like Mei Lanfang's final act. The dispute between those who advocated for Beijing and those who advocated for Nanjing was like a Peking opera and Shanghai opera singing against each other on the same stage, and finally, the whole thing was capped off with a dispute over a female representative leaving the meeting, almost resulting in a full-scale fight, from beginning to end, very much like a "Grand Variety Show."</p>
<p>When discussing the issue of the national capital, the representatives spoke extensively about geographical terms and historical lessons, a stark contrast to their earlier discussions about "sovereignty" and "national rights." One representative said that the morning felt like attending a constitutional law class, and the afternoon felt like attending a geography and history class.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiyan spearheaded the charge for the Beijing faction, speaking fluently and with great familiarity with place names. He believed that if there were no problems with the national capital, it would not need to be stipulated. Since there was a problem, it had to be explicitly stipulated. He also said that some people opposed returning the capital due to economic difficulties, but this reason was as insufficient as not convening the National Assembly due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Qiu Bie, a respected figure from Hunan, did not advocate for establishing the capital in Changsha but advocated for establishing the capital in Xi'an. He believed that for the sake of the overall situation, the most difficult and challenging location should be chosen, and the capital should not be established in Nanjing or Beijing, which are comfortable places for "eating, drinking, and procreation" and have spacious houses.</p>
<p>When elder statesman Zhang Pu spoke for over fifteen minutes, he first stated that "I am not trying to show off my intelligence." He said that as far as he knew, establishing the capital in Nanjing was not Dr. Sun Yat-sen's original intention. Dr. Sun's advocacy for establishing the capital in Nanjing was a temporary idea, not a permanent one. Finally, he pointed out solemnly that if the capital were to be established in Nanjing again, it would inevitably lead to national demise. The applause after his speech lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>Lai Jianjun, a representative from Chongqing, spoke in a strong Sichuan accent, hoping that people would not forget the wartime capital of Chongqing. Lai said sadly that Chongqing had been bombed by the enemy for years but never succumbed, and the words "wartime capital" were written in blood.</p>
<p>Wu Yanhuan, who opposed establishing the capital in Nanjing, said, "If Dr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive today, he would surely advocate for establishing the capital in Beijing." The whole audience burst into laughter. He opposed establishing the capital in Nanjing because Dr. Sun's mausoleum was in Nanjing. He said, "The ancestor of the Chinese nation is the Yellow Emperor, and his mausoleum is far away in a desolate county in central Shaanxi. Should we not establish the capital in central China because of that? Some say that moving the capital to Hualin is actually just to escape to Lushan for summer, and the money spent on that is not insignificant either."</p>
<p>Liu Baimin delivered the final act, strongly advocating for establishing the capital in Nanjing. His most brilliant remark was that today is the 11th, and the day after tomorrow is the 13th, the day of the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese. How many compatriots died for Nanjing to be the capital? Nanjing became the capital with blood. Another representative also pointed out that although Nanjing was not able to defend itself for long during the War of Resistance, the fall of Beijing came before the fall of Nanjing. Therefore, Nanjing should not be denied the position of capital because it was once lost.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communists Openly Launch Internal Rebellion, Lin Zuhan Calls for Mobilization of Soldiers and Civilians in Communist Areas, Communist Troops Gradually Lose Ground in Street Fighting in Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Xinhua North News Agency reports: Lin Zuhan, Chairman of the Yan'an Border Region Government, recently called on all Communist soldiers and civilians to mobilize and participate in the "Defense of Yan'an." Lin requested that the entire region enter a state of combat from a state of bloody battle, rise up together, and "defend the fortress." He urged everyone to recognize the spirit of "everything for the front line" and work hard to assist the front-line troops in annihilating Hu Zongnan's forces. Lin said that in the past month, the National Army had concentrated large forces on the border of Yan'an, constantly making probing attacks on the border region, but all had been repelled.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] After the National Army stormed into the south gate of Yancheng in northern Jiangsu, street fighting is still ongoing, and a tug-of-war situation has developed over the past 48 hours. Communist troops are still entrenched in the east and west gates, stubbornly resisting, but are gradually showing signs of collapse.</p>
<p>[Our Tiejiang Dispatch, 11th] The battle in northern Jiangsu is coming to an end. The National Army, advancing in multiple directions from Huaiyin, Suyu, Sicheng, and Dongtai, and dividing its forces to attack Suqian, Shuyang, Yancheng, and Funing, is now using its overwhelming military strength to protect the return of civilians to their hometowns in the aforementioned areas. The momentum is unprecedented. According to qualified sources in the military, the Communist forces in Yancheng and Funing have now been isolated, and the Communist forces in Lianshui and Shuyang are also vulnerable to attack. The situation in northern Jiangsu can definitely be clarified within this year. The fighting in Yancheng is still fierce today, and the Communist commander Xu Xiangqian is personally supervising the battle, attempting to defend it to the death.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 11th] The Communist troops recently drew a large number of main forces from Lianshui and concentrated them near Yancheng, harassing the National Army positions at Liuzhuang. Another part of the force crossed Liuzhuang and moved south, possibly attempting to invade Dongtai. Currently, the Communist forces in the Jianfuning area include the entire First Division, the 30th Brigade, the 31st Brigade, the 13th Brigade, the Yancheng-Funing Independent Brigade, the Central China Special Service Regiment, the Second Jiangsu Sub-Regiment, and other local troops, totaling more than 40 regiments. The National Army is on high alert.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] Military news: The National Army, which is advancing from Huaiyin towards Lianshui and Shuyang, has made further progress after recovering Xiaowuji. Another route of the National Army simultaneously cut off the connection between the Communist forces in Shuyang and Funing. The Communist forces in Yancheng, after being severely attacked by Li's unit of the National Army, no longer have any ability to resist, and the city can be recovered today or tomorrow. It is also reported that the Yancheng Party and government organs are also advancing with the army.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] It is learned that after the National Army crossed the Liutang River yesterday, it has recovered Qianjiaji, which belongs to Shuyang County, again today. In addition, Communist troops in the Haishu area have been carrying weapons and surrendering to the National Army in Xinpu one after another in recent weeks.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 11th] Political news: The Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the governments of Yancheng, Funing, Lianshui, and Shuyang counties a week ago to prepare to cooperate with the National Army's demobilization at any time, appease the displaced, and expedite relief and rehabilitation. It is reported that Yancheng and Funing counties have suffered the most damage, and there are more than 500,000 refugees awaiting rescue. There is an urgent need for 1 billion yuan in relief funds and a large amount of cotton clothing, because the cotton clothing of the people in these two counties has been requisitioned by the Communist troops, leaving the people with only hemp cloth mourning clothes to get through the winter, and their situation is extremely miserable.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Military Conference Decides on Internal Rebellion Plan, Attempting to Rebuild Six Base Areas</h3>

(2) In the Northeast region, Lin Biao will be responsible for using the name of the Democratic Allied Army to call on the masses, and then cut off the Beining Road, occupy various seaports, such as Huludao, Qinhuangdao, and their surrounding areas, to isolate the National Army in the Northeast. (3) In the North China region, every effort should be made to seal off the cities, shrink the encirclement, destroy transportation, and collect supplies, and to carry out piecemeal annihilation through mobile warfare. (4) Re-establish six base areas, including the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Region, the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Region, the Sichuan-Hunan Border Region, the Guizhou-Guangxi Border Region, and the Qiongya Island Region.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Destroy Historical Sites, Ming Tombs Dismantled and Transported Away</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Since the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming Dynasty in Beiping County were occupied by the Communist troops, the Kang Tomb, Zhao Tomb, Xian Tomb, Tai Tomb, and Mao Tomb have all had their original palaces dismantled. The nanmu pillars have been transported and sold, and the pine and cypress trees have been felled and burned. The architecture of the Ming Tombs is grand and large in scale, and they are famous historical sites. Before the war, the government repeatedly ordered their protection, and tourists from abroad also came to visit in an endless stream. Now that they have been destroyed by the Communist troops, the losses are extremely heavy. The Hebei Provincial Government has, in addition to forwarding the matter to the Beiping Military Mediation Department to request that measures be taken to stop this, also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan to request instructions on how to deal with the matter.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Weighing Scales and Weights, Embezzling Two Tons of Food, Head of Guilin Storage and Transportation Station Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 11th] The Guilin Storage and Transportation Station of the Guilin Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) counterfeited weighing scales and weights, using tin blocks to increase the size of the weights, embezzling a total of two tons of food. After reports from various parties, the person in charge, Jiang Yuancheng, has been arrested and is awaiting interrogation.</p>
<h3>Director of UNRRA Henan Branch Reports that Yellow River Closure Will Be Completed, UNRRA Representative Says Flood Area Situation is Terrible</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ma Jie, Director of the UNRRA Henan Branch, UNRRA representative Mr. West, and Song Tong, Director of Construction of Henan Province, gave a joint press conference at UNRRA yesterday afternoon to report on the progress of the Yellow River flood area restoration project. Mr. West gave the report first, saying: The Yellow River closure project is about to be completed, but the ultimate goal of the closure is to restore the old course and revive the Yellow River flood area, so that the people in the area can live and work in peace. Ma also described the three reasons why UNRRA is so eager to expedite the repair of the breach: (1) The breach was caused by the war, and now that the war is over, the refugees should no longer be displaced and should be stabilized as soon as possible; (2) If repairs are not expedited at this time, some of the good farmland in the area will no longer be able to produce and will become barren; (3) The land on both sides of the Yellow River is fertile and suitable for cultivation. If it is not remedied, the food supply in the area will be quite problematic. After the repair is completed, the area can be used as a test site for mechanized farming. However, this work is not easy, and problems such as child welfare and traffic sanitation are difficult to solve.</p>
<p>According to Mr. West, the situation in the Yellow River flood area is terrible. This kind of great flood only occurred in the Roman era in world history, and it took two thousand years to manage it. The complexity of the US TVA can be compared to the Yellow River, but its social situation is not as complicated as China's. Mr. West reported the results of the survey of the Yellow River flood area: the area covers a total of 16.5 million mu, of which 7.5 million mu are in Henan Province, and 990,000 mu of land are covered with weeds and need to be re-arranged before they can be cultivated. At the same time, according to a survey, Fugou County in the area had a population of 320,000 in 1938, but only 44,000 remained a year and a half ago. Most of the remaining population had fled, were scattered, or died in the disaster. Currently, it has increased to 140,000 people, all of whom are returning home from various places, at a rate of 500 people per week. However, there is still no way to solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter after returning home.</p>
<p>Finally, Song Tong reported that the Henan Provincial Government is extremely concerned about this disaster and has specially organized a guidance committee to assist returning residents in carrying out various affairs and to find ways to solve land ownership problems. After receiving relief supplies from UNRRA, the committee has made great progress in promoting its work.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu's Remarks</h3>
<p>Pointing Out Unfair Distribution of Relief Supplies</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Dong Biwu spoke to reporters on the evening of the 11th regarding the distribution of relief supplies: (1) Of the 15 UNRRA branches nationwide, 8 are related to Communist areas, accounting for 69% of the population, but their distribution of relief supplies is only 10% of what they should receive, which is really unfair. Mr. Ray, the former head of the UNRRA office in China, also said that this ratio is a "bad conclusion." Jiang Tingfu and Ray had intended to improve it but failed. The current new director, Eggerton, also intends to improve it, and Huo Doushu has repeatedly stated that there should be no discrimination due to party affiliation, but the unfair phenomenon has been established. The news report quoted Huo Doushu as making three points, believing that the reason why the distribution to the Communist areas is less is because most of the supplies shipped are food, while the Communist areas are producing areas, which does not correspond to the facts. For example, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei area only produces black beans, while the Hunan-Jiangxi area is a grain-producing area, but there is still a distribution of relief supplies, so this matter should be carefully handled. (2) More than 30 tons of heavy machinery from UNRRA do not need to be distributed to the Communist areas. In fact, there is still some light machinery that has not been distributed either. (3) Regarding the Yellow River closure, the Communist area has completed the project, and UNRRA has inspected it, but the dangerous parts cannot be done due to lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Cotton Clothes Thin and Rotten, How Can They Resist the Cold?</h3>
<p>Hankou Poor People March in Protest</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 11th] More than 300 poor people in Hankou protested to the relevant authorities yesterday because the winter clothes issued by the local relief branch were all thin and rotten and could not be used. They hung the torn clothes they received on the tops of bamboo poles and marched on Zhongshan Avenue with the words "Thank you to the Relief Branch" written on them. For a time, the spectators were as crowded as walls.</p>
<h3>US Establishes Consulate in Harbin, Rejected by the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan officially notified the US Embassy this afternoon that, on orders from Yan'an, the Communist Party will refuse the entry of Mr. Clubb, the US Consul General appointed to Harbin, on the grounds that the area is a military zone. He also said that if it were peacetime, Mr. Clubb would have been allowed to go. When asked if Yan'an's rejection of the US Consul's entry into Harbin was related to the Communist Party's usual accusation that the United States was aiding the government, he replied that Yan'an had not responded in that way.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The State Department today confirmed reports that the Chinese Communists would prevent the US government from establishing a consulate in Harbin. A State Department spokesman said that US Consul General Clubb had waited patiently for eight months for the Communist side to allow him to go to Harbin to establish a consulate, but because he was ultimately not granted permission by the Communist side, he is currently still performing his consular duties in Changchun.</p>
<h3>Several Issues Related to Elections in the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>(III) Women and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to Article 129 of the draft constitution, "Citizens of the Republic of China who are 20 years of age or older have the right to vote in accordance with the law. Unless otherwise stipulated in this Constitution and the law, those who are 23 years of age or older have the right to be elected in accordance with the law." Chapter 2, Article 8 also stipulates that "Citizens of the Republic of China are equal under the law regardless of gender..." However, there are still some issues related to women in the proposals regarding elections this time.</p>
<p>Representative Chen Guyuan and 62 others proposed adding a proviso to Article 130, which states that "Candidates for all elections stipulated in this Constitution shall compete openly": "However, regarding the election of representatives to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the minimum number of women to be elected should be stipulated by law." Their reasoning is that in today's patriarchal society, men will inevitably win in open competition between men and women. Therefore, in past cases in our country, the minimum number of women to be elected has been stipulated to avoid the idea of gender equality becoming a mere name. The British Parliament also has provisions for women. Representative Wei Tingsheng and 52 others proposed in Proposal No. 86 to add "representatives elected by women's organizations" under Article 26, "The National Assembly is organized by the following national representatives." They believe that this can prevent women from being disadvantaged when competing with men, and that "women's problems must be solved by women."</p>
<p>The recently deceased female representative Liu Chunyit she also proposed with Ni Guifu and 33 other representatives to add after Article 130, "In all candidate lists stipulated by party law, the number of women shall not be less than 30%." This is more concrete than Chen Guyuan's proposal. As for why it is stipulated to be 30% or more, the original proposal does not explain.</p>
<p>Another issue related to elections in the 100 proposals this time is whether overseas Chinese have the right to elect members of the Control Yuan. According to the provisions of Article 26, Item 2 and Article 95 of the draft constitution, overseas Chinese do not have the right to elect members of the Control Yuan. There are four proposals for supplementation proposed by Chen Shuren and others, and their reasons are as follows: (1) Article 65 of the draft constitution stipulates the allocation of seats in the Legislative Yuan, including the item of "citizens residing abroad," while the allocation of seats in the Control Yuan lacks this item, so it should be added; (2) Overseas Chinese are straightforward and dare to speak out, and are good at impeachment and oversight; (3) According to the provisions of Article 26, members of the Control Yuan and members of the Legislative Yuan have the same qualifications, that is, they simultaneously have the qualifications of representatives to the National Assembly. Therefore, their method of selection should be the same as that of other members of the Legislative Yuan, that is, directly elected by the people. However, the members of the Control Yuan stipulated in Article 26, Item 2 and Article 96 are exceptions, and are determined to be indirectly elected by the parliament. This is a case of different natures being treated differently by law, so it is advocated that all should be directly elected by the people.</p>
<p>In addition to the above issues, the election issues involved in the proposals also include (1) direct elections versus indirect elections, (2) whether representatives to the National Assembly have the right to elect important officials other than the president and vice president, (3) whether current officials in active duty can participate in the election of representatives to the National Assembly before being dismissed or approved, (4) the age of electors and those elected, (5) the election of representatives to the National Assembly in municipalities directly under the central government, etc. It is believed that these issues will be hotly debated in the review committee.

<h3>Another Incident Occurs in Hanoi: Five Overseas Chinese Shot Dead; Conflicts Between French and Vietnamese Continue, Causing Displacement of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 10th] Since the 23rd of last month, railway and highway traffic from Hanoi to Haiphong has been interrupted and has not yet resumed. Consequently, transportation issues have become the most critical problem at present. An aerial survey revealed that the highway has been damaged at several points, and many railway tracks are also destroyed and unusable. Therefore, the only means of transportation between Hanoi and Haiphong is by air, resulting in the inability to transport heavy goods, European food, and newly arrived luggage from France. Furthermore, it has been learned that an incident occurred again tonight approximately ten kilometers northeast of Hanoi. It is reported that five overseas Chinese were shot dead by Vietnamese, further escalating tensions between the overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] French-Vietnamese Military Conflict in Haiphong: Viewing Chinese as Neutral, as of yesterday, investigations have revealed that over 800 overseas Chinese have been killed, injured, gone missing, or been arrested. Property losses are estimated at over 29 million Vietnamese currency units. Displacement is widespread, and the situation is heartbreaking. The atmosphere of violence has spread to various parts of Hanoi. The French side is determined to resolve the Vietnamese situation by force, while the Vietnamese side insists that French troops must return to their original garrison areas in Haiphong and Lang Son as they were before November 20th before negotiations can begin. Both sides are taking extreme positions, sharpening their swords and preparing for imminent conflict. There has been no concrete solution to our request for the demarcation of a neutral zone and effective protection of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Wartime Losses of Private Factories; Industrial Associations to Participate in the Committee for Japanese Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Two matters, namely, compensation for wartime losses of private factories in our country and the participation of the Industrial Association in the Committee for Japanese Reparations, have been approved by the authorities. Representatives from the China National Federation of Industries and the Shanghai Industrial Association, including Chairman Wu Yun-chu, Executive Directors Hu Bo-xiang, Jin Run-xiang, and Tang Xu-zhi, met with Deputy Executive Yuan President Weng Wen-hao and Economic Affairs Department Director Wu Cheng-luo and Chief Secretary Xu Bai-qi on the 11th to decide on these matters. Deputy Executive Yuan President Weng Wen-hao personally assured that wartime losses of private factories would be compensated by the Executive Yuan and relevant departments. The China National Federation of Industries will also be able to send representatives to participate in the Committee for Japanese Reparations to facilitate the handling of Japanese reparations to our country. Weng Wen-hao also entrusted the Industrial Association to collect data on wartime losses of private factories nationwide for the government's reference. The four representatives, considering that the purpose of their petition had been achieved, except for Wu Yun-chu who remained in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly, all returned to Shanghai the following day.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Municipal Budget for the Next Year</h3>
<p>The revenue listed in the municipal budget for the 36th year of the Republic is 210,193,981,125 yuan. The total expenditure is 523,675,917,990 yuan, resulting in a deficit of 313,481,936,775 yuan. This deficit figure is already shocking. It is heard that after consultations between the municipal government, the actual revenue figure is only 190,800,000,000 yuan. Moreover, items such as housing tax and banquet tax are still estimated based on the current tax rates, without adopting the standards stipulated by the central government. Therefore, according to the most conservative estimate, the revenue is said to be only 110 billion yuan. In that case, the deficit would be over 410 billion yuan, exceeding the actual revenue by about three times and exceeding the revenue agreed upon by the municipal government by more than one time!</p>
<p>The municipal government's solution is to adopt the principle of living within its means, which means calculating roughly double the budget for the second half of this year, totaling 214,017,433,470 yuan, and then making appropriate cuts to reach the hypothetical figure of 190.8 billion yuan. New items that need to be handled will be included in a separate budget, and separate sources of funding will be planned. In other words, things will be done if there is money, and not done if there is no money; as much will be done as there is money. It is heard that the target of this new source of funding is likely to be government bonds.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Even a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice." With only so much money, naturally, only so many things can be done. The municipal government has not tried to find all possible ways to raise funds this time, but has very realistically maintained the status quo, adhering to the principle of living within its means, which is, on the whole, worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Currently, the finances of various regions are all suffering deficits. There are naturally many complex reasons for this, but the idea of revitalizing everything, trying to embellish as much as possible, and supporting the façade in many ways is, in fact, the main cause of the deficits and their expansion. The reason is that the heads of various departments, driven by a sense of responsibility, naturally want to do as much as possible within the scope of their responsibilities, holding the ambition of doing everything at the same time. Coupled with the instructions of superior agencies, the resolutions of long-term agencies, and the suggestions from various parties, they cannot but deal with things separately and advance on multiple fronts at the same time. Therefore, the important factor of finance is relegated to a secondary position. To reverse this trend and make up for the budget shortfall, apart from the highest officials of various ministries or localities making overall plans based on the time and place, weighing the priorities, there is no other way. For example, this time the revenue of Shanghai is limited to 190.8 billion yuan, while the expenditure required to maintain the status quo is 214 billion yuan. Looking at the figures, it seems that revenue and expenditure are still insufficient. In fact, the budgets made by various units in the first place (for the second half of the 35th year of the Republic) were not very realistic. Originally, when compiling the expenditure and policy plans, they wanted to do as many things as possible and ask for as much money as possible. However, when the budget was finalized, due to various reasons, the planned work could not be started, so many funds were frozen in the treasury and could not be withdrawn. According to someone in the know, the operational expenses of a certain agency that had not been spent amounted to one-third. If this is reliable, then doubling the expenses for the second half of this year to serve as the expenditure budget for the next year still needs to be discounted, because while this is ostensibly maintaining the status quo, it still carries some idealism.</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan recently separately discussed and resolved that the tax rates for housing tax and banquet tax, etc., are much lower than those currently in effect in this city. At a time when the city's finances are suffering a huge deficit, if we were to say that taxes should be collected according to the central government's tax rates, it would seem like we are joking with the municipal financial authorities and being too unsympathetic. In fact, this concerns the spirit of the rule of law, not just a matter of a few dollars. If revenue is indeed insufficient after reducing taxes in accordance with the law, our ideal is that we would rather seek other legitimate new sources of funding to compensate, rather than openly disregard the central government's laws.</p>
<p>We must also admit that the difference of these few dollars is not enough to excessively affect the municipal budget. What will most severely affect the municipal budget in the future is prices, not a partial reduction in taxes. If prices continue to rise sharply next year, and civil servants' salaries still need to be adjusted every three months as usual, and various construction materials, purchases, repairs, and other expenses must be increased at any time, then the originally planned 5% reserve fund and the 36 billion yuan for adjusting living allowances will probably still be insufficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, in peaceful times, the figures in the budget are indeed worthy of attention. In this extraordinary time of economic hardship, rather than meticulously calculating the equality of revenue and expenditure, it is more practical to stabilize prices and resolve the crisis in industry and commerce. Looking at the revenue table of our city, business tax, license tax, wharf dues, etc., are certainly closely related to the prosperity and decline of the market. Even other taxes such as slaughter tax, banquet and entertainment tax, stockade tax, all kinds of fees, public business income, housing tax, and construction tax levied on public utilities, etc., are all closely related to the market. Therefore, the accuracy of our city's budget for next year lies not in the estimated figures at present, but in the changes in prices and the market.</p>
<h3>Improper Verdict in the Shibuya Incident; Our Representatives Express Objections; Investigation of Responsibility of Japanese Police Should Be Conducted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The 36 compatriots arrested in the Shibuya Incident were sentenced this afternoon after two and a half months of interrogation. Among them, two were acquitted and released, one was sentenced to three years of hard labor, and the other 33 were sentenced to two years of hard labor. The Taiwanese compatriots who were convicted will be deported and will not be allowed to return to Japan during the Allied occupation. Qiu Jun, the Chinese member of the international tribunal, who formed a three-person committee with two American and French judges to be responsible for reviewing the Shibuya case, immediately raised an objection after the verdict. Qiu forcefully stated: "The prosecution has not been able to prove the guilt of the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. This committee should make a decision to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit and acquit the defendants." Qiu's objection immediately raised the question of whether the verdict was appropriate, as the three-person committee only obtained a two-thirds vote to convict the defendants. It is reported that the head of our delegation to Japan, General Zhu Shiming, and Shen Guanding will visit the American Acheson to discuss the verdict of the Shibuya case. Shen will also raise the issue of the responsibility of the Japanese police in the shooting incident on July 19, as the defendants have consistently denied the responsibility of firing the first shot in the incident that resulted in the death of six Taiwanese compatriots and the injury of more than 20. When the Japanese police testified in court, they stated that they had used as many as 542 bullets in the incident. According to the chairman of the three-person committee, the case will be submitted to the occupation authorities for review. After the Shibuya incident occurred, our delegation in Japan has consistently insisted on conducting a complete and fair investigation. The continuous efforts of our representatives are aimed at ensuring that the Taiwanese compatriots receive a fair trial and that the responsibility of both parties involved in the conflict can be clarified. However, the investigation of the responsibility of the Japanese police has not yet been completed.</p>
<h3>National Army Demobilization Plan Affected by Political Situation</h3>
<p>Huang Jie's Remarks to Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th] General Huang Jie, acting head of the Central Training Corps, which is responsible for training demobilized army officers for employment, stated today during a reception for journalists that the National Army's strength is currently about 150 divisions after completing the first phase of the demobilization plan from January to September this year. General Huang also revealed that the speed of the National Army's demobilization has been greatly reduced due to the ongoing civil war and unstable political situation. The second phase of demobilization, which was originally planned to begin after the completion of the first phase, is still in the planning stage, but has in fact been postponed indefinitely. Huang stated that according to the original plan and the provisions of the National-Communist Army Reorganization Agreement, the army should be reduced to 90 divisions after the completion of the second phase of demobilization, and finally to 60 divisions by the end of next year.</p>

<h3>Gang of Thieves Cracked Down in Bengbu; Bandits Recruit Followers Under False Pretenses, Appointing Themselves Battalion Commanders and Engaging in Fraud</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Bengbu News] Since Bengbu City implemented winter defense measures, military and police security agencies have been stepping up patrols day and night. However, robbery cases still occur frequently. Chen Yi's family in Huangshanbao, West City District, was robbed at night, and Chen's father, Zhao Hui, was strangled to death. The Lao Fengxiang and Lao Tiandou silver shops were robbed of gold jewelry in broad daylight, demonstrating the rampant nature of the bandits. Recently, during the military and police investigation of bandits, a case of falsely using names, colluding with bandits, and secretly organizing convoys was cracked. The arrest of fake regiment commander He Dongshan and more than a dozen suspects has dealt a major blow to the bandit gangs that threaten security. The following is a detailed account of the case, according to the investigation: A bandit named He Dongshan had long colluded with bandits in the Hongze area of eastern Anhui, intending to use them for his own purposes. Someone introduced him to a person named Zhu Jiannong, who claimed to be a senior advisor to the Ministry of National Defense, often wearing a major general insignia and certificate, traveling between Nanjing and Bengbu, and appearing to be a high-ranking military officer. He Dongshan, Zhu Wei, and others colluded with him, openly recruiting bandits from Tianji'an in Hongze Lake, organizing them into the 7th and 8th Regiments of the Anhui Security Force, and appointing He Dongshan as the commander of the 7th Regiment, Cao Gan-chen as the commander of the 1st Battalion, Gu Yan as the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Zhu Wei as the commander of the 3rd Battalion, Shi Shurong as the commander of the 8th Regiment, and Zhang Yun-cheng as the deputy commander. The main cadres were mostly decided internally. He and others set up a secret agency at No. 526, Er Ma Road, Bengbu. Those who were accustomed to miscellaneous troops and had relations with the authorities flocked to it, gathering in the agency from time to time, with their actions being secretive and their activities very vigorous. Li Bo-ying, who had participated in puppet organizations and served as a puppet army detachment commander during the enemy and puppet occupation, also participated in the activities. Before long, He Dongshan was arrested by the police bureau on suspicion of being a bandit. The position of commander of the puppet 7th Regiment was temporarily held by Zhang Yun-cheng. Zhang, Li, and others continued to operate secretly, boasting everywhere, attracting bandits, and claiming to organize a security regiment, plotting wrongdoing. This was learned by the intelligence team of the political department of the 8th Pacification District. They notified the Bengbu garrison to investigate. The team sent squad leader Zhang Huayu, disguised as an associate, to infiltrate the puppet battalion commander Zhu Wei's place, pretending to join in the plan. After Zhang's investigation for half a month, he fully understood the truth of the bandit gang falsely using names and numbers. So he secretly reported to the military police and cracked down on the puppet agency, arresting bandits Zhang Yun-cheng, Shi Shurong, Cao Gan-chen, Li Bo-ying, Li Xing-ya, Zhang Zhi-wu, Zhu Wei, Yan Jun-kui, Sun Jian-tang, and 19 suspects in total. They then sent a letter to the police bureau to extradite He Dongshan to the team headquarters. After three days and nights of interrogation, He and others confessed to falsely using names, colluding with bandits, organizing troops, and plotting wrongdoing. Except for the suspects who were released on bail due to their lack of involvement in the case, all the perpetrators were transferred to the headquarters of the 8th Pacification District on the 7th for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Industries Struggle to Survive the Year-End; Banks Agree to Lend 5 Billion, Making Loans with the Lowest Interest Rates as Collateral</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] The Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce, responding to the request of the Grain Industry Association, stated that as the end of the year approaches, business and the economy are as depleted as ever. If relief is not sought quickly, the wave of business closures by the end of the year will be even more severe than in the past. The current crisis is lurking on all sides and cannot be delayed. Therefore, on the 11th, it convened the chairmen of various industry associations and invited all state-owned and commercial banks in the county to discuss emergency relief measures. In an atmosphere of mutual understanding, the banking community sincerely expressed its willingness to assist. Therefore, concrete measures have been obtained, the nature of which is mortgage loans, with a total amount of 5 billion, lent at the lowest interest rate. The various industry associations will organize joint warehouses, handing them over to the banking industry for safekeeping as collateral. As for the repayment period, it is tentatively set for two months, from the twelfth lunar month to the end of the first month of the new year, so that the various businesses can obtain assistance during the two festivals and weather the year-end storm. This plan will be implemented as soon as the banking association agrees on the interest rate.</p>
<h3>Suzhou City Councilor Election; Disputes Emerge from Beneath the Surface</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] The preliminary election of city councilors from professional groups in this county has come to an end, with more than 200 candidates being produced for the runoff election. A formal election will be held at the end of this month to produce 43 county councilors. However, based on the views of various aspects of society, it is widely believed that the preliminary election preparations were insufficient and were held in haste. Therefore, there is no shortage of manipulation. Some member representatives of ten industry associations even reported in newspapers that they did not know how the winners of the preliminary election in their own groups were produced, and even did not know the date and location of the preliminary election. As a result, the tide of brewing disputes among various professional groups has become increasingly acute. Now, the Civil Shipping Industry Association has erupted, with member representatives Zhao Xiaosizi and others submitting a petition to the Provisional Council and the county government on the 11th, revealing that there was no prior notice given during the association's preliminary election. Therefore, the three runoff election candidates Wang Duanzhang, Zhu Zheng'an, and Chu Jinchun cannot be recognized as having legal qualifications. Moreover, Wang Duanzhang and others are currently being investigated by the county government for another case and are difficult to gain public trust. They requested a re-election, etc. The Provisional Council has now sent a letter to the county government for a detailed investigation to show that the election is serious.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Requests Loans to Purchase Grain to Prevent Famine</h3>
<p>[Ningbo News] The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce recently received a message from Si Chi-wen, the representative attending the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Joint Conference, stating that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) could provide loans to grain-deficient counties to purchase and store food grains to prepare for famine relief. After inviting people from all walks of life to discuss the implementation of the measures, the discussion resulted in a joint request by the Commissioner's Office, the county government, the council, the county party headquarters, and the chamber of commerce for a loan of 1 billion yuan from UNRRA. After the approval is obtained, a meeting will be convened to discuss the organization of the presiding body and all implementation matters.</p>
<h3>Many Difficulties in Jiangsu Province's Military Grain Requisition</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] There are many difficulties in Jiangsu Province's military grain requisition. In November, only 260,000 piculs of grain were requisitioned, equivalent to 130,000 piculs of rice. The Provincial Land and Food Department, due to the urgent need for grain by the central government, has telegraphed the Xuzhou, Nanjing, Nantong, and Wuxi Purchasing Stations to quickly raise and allocate funds. According to the investigation, the reasons for the difficulties are: (1) Insufficient processing and production after requisition; (2) Inconvenient transportation; (3) Insufficient transportation costs.</p>
<h3>Li Pinxian Awarded American Medal and Citation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hefei, 11th] American President Truman awarded Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian the Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm for his great contribution to the victory of the United Nations. The award has been forwarded to the province by the National Government. Truman also sent a citation, which read: "General Li Pinxian, who made significant contributions to the Allied war effort, is hereby awarded the Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm. Although his work, due to the limitations of his authority, was not a direct help to the Allied war effort, General Li Pinxian's wise leadership and personal efforts greatly contributed to the final victory of the United Nations." After receiving the medal and citation, Li Pinxian sent a letter to President Truman, the original text of which is as follows: "To His Excellency President Truman: I am deeply grateful for your bestowal of the Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm and citation. Under your wise leadership, we finally defeated our common enemy in this United Nations war. However, the common goal after the war is to seek lasting peace for the entire world. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Chinese and American people can further strengthen their ties in the future and uphold our spirit of wholehearted cooperation during the war to achieve this common goal. I wish you and your wife good health, Li Pinxian respectfully."</p>
<h3>Newly Registered Households on the Chongming North Coast Are All Abolished; Years of Disputes May Come to an End</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Chongming News] In the past ten years, many newly accreted fields have emerged along the north coast of this county, with a total area of over 2,000 mu that can be cultivated. They are all fertile fields of exceptional quality. Some people paid the provincial government during the occupation of Chongming Island to register and receive ownership. Last autumn, the Japanese surrendered, and the country was restored. They jointly organized a reclamation agency, preparing to manage the land. However, the old households residing in the newly accreted area, holding old deeds for mudflat lands, claimed that the newly accreted sand fields were originally civilian lands that had collapsed into the sea and had been taxed for decades, with seals as proof. Therefore, the property rights of the land could not disappear. The two sides engaged in fierce disputes, lasting for more than a year. They presented their cases to the provincial and central government departments, but there were no concrete results. During the summer and autumn this year, the two sides engaged in armed conflicts, resulting in bloodshed and lawsuits. It has been learned that the county government has received an order from the provincial government to abolish all newly registered households who paid for registration during the occupation and to return the fees they paid. In the midst of calls for land system reform, this major case may be quickly resolved.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silkworm Egg Investigation Team; Begins Work Simultaneously in Three Groups</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] The members of the silkworm egg manufacturing field investigation team of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been decided at a meeting held by relevant parties the day before yesterday, and it has been decided to start work in various places from tomorrow. There are two groups in Jiangsu. The first group will investigate various fields near Wuxi, gathering at the Provincial Silkworm Experiment Field in Qianqiao Town, Wuxi. The selected personnel are Cao Wu-bo, Shen Shi-hao, Cao Yi-sun, and Qian Yi. The second group will investigate various fields outside the vicinity of Wuxi, gathering at the Suzhou Sericulture Improvement Zone. The selected personnel are Zhang Quan-fen, Wang Gan-zhi, Zhou Hong-wen, and Chen Dong-lin. There is one group in Zhejiang, gathering at the Silkworm Industry Supervision Office on Dongpo Road, Hangzhou. The selected personnel are Hu Hong-jun, Lu Hui-jian, Lu Shou-ren, and Jiang Nai-bin. Each group will have two representatives from the China Silkworm Company, one from the China Farmers Bank, and the rest will be responsible personnel from the silkworm egg experiment fields and improvement zones in the two provinces.</p>
<h3>Funding for the Qiantang River Seawall Repair Project Should Be Included in the National Budget; Zhejiang Province Is Unable to Bear the Cost Due to Economic Hardship; Two Department Heads Invite Relevant Central Government Officials to Discuss</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department Director Ruan Yi-cheng and Construction Department Director Pi Zuo-qiong invited relevant central government departmental officials and representatives from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai attending the National Assembly to discuss the repair of the Qiantang River seawall. It is reported that the central government approved 6 billion yuan for the Zhejiang seawall project for the second half of this year, of which 2.1 billion yuan will be allocated by the central government, 2 billion yuan will be allocated in relief materials by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and another 2 billion yuan will be borne by the people of Zhejiang. However, after the war, Zhejiang is in economic hardship and unable to bear the cost. It is requested that it all be allocated by the central government. The 11 billion yuan needed for next year is also proposed to be included in the national budget, as the Qiantang River seawall concerns the livelihoods of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai City and is not a water conservancy project within a single province. Moreover, seawall repairs have always been funded by the state in the past, and the local people have never been required to bear the cost of the ancestors in addition to the labor force. Ruan and others also said that they hope to change the Seawall Works Bureau into a direct subordinate of the central government in order to increase efficiency and proceed actively.</p>
<h3>Thefts Involving Automobiles and Boats: Three Notorious Bandits Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent's Hot News] The Criminal Police Team here recently captured, in disguise, the notorious bandits Zhou Xing, Gao Heshang, and Chen Heting, along with four others, in Mocheng Dongshizhuang and Wuxianba, who were involved in major robberies on both land and water routes. They seized one Mauser pistol and one box magazine pistol. During interrogation, they confessed to repeatedly colluding with A Bing (already executed) and others to rob passenger cars on the Su-Chang routes. They also admitted to robbing boats such as the Xiyi, Shatou, Beiguo, Kun-Chang, Chengqin, and Su-Chang lines in the lakes during August, September, and October. Additionally, they confessed to robbing three Dahua-bound boats near Shanqian outside Ximen in a single day. The team, considering the seriousness of the case, transferred it to the Main Bureau on the 10th for submission to the County Government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Bandit Sightings Frequent in Pinghu: Joint Defense Initiated by Four Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Pinghu Correspondent] Following the change in weather, our county experienced two winter defense alarms in the past two days: (1) A kidnapping occurred in Baziqiao, where Yunping borders Jinshan County. Bandits operated at night, hiding the victim near Zhouye Temple in Xinzhi Township, which belongs to this county. The victim escaped by pushing through a wall at night and reported to the Zhangyan factory. When the team was dispatched to search, the bandits had already fled. (2) An unidentified armed team wearing military uniforms, carrying two machine guns, was spotted near Dacun Bridge in Shida Township. The next day, these soldiers suddenly removed their uniforms, changed into plain clothes, and headed towards Jinshan County with mysterious actions. Upon receiving the report, the police Criminal Investigation Team, fearing other developments, reported to the authorities for verification. In order to ensure winter security in remote rural areas, the county government will reportedly collaborate with neighboring county security authorities to initiate a joint defense involving Ping, Jia, Jin, and Song counties.</p>
<h3>Anti-Bandit Campaign in Zhejiang Province Nearing Completion: Over a Thousand Bandits Captured; Enhanced Transportation Protection During Winter Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 11th] Zhejiang Deputy Security Commander Deng Mingqing reported on the anti-bandit campaign in Zhejiang Province. A total of 1,053 bandits have been captured, 198 surrendered, 251 were wounded or killed, and 76 short guns, 2 heavy machine guns, and 3 light machine guns, along with over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, were seized. Except for the borders of Su, Zhe, An, and Min provinces and coastal bandits, there are no bandit gangs of more than ten people in areas such as Siming Mountain, Kuaiji Mountain, Jiaojiang, and Yongle. However, bandits are like weeds, disappearing only to reappear, and the practice of dispersing and hiding among the people has not been eliminated. It is estimated that there are still over a thousand bandits, and the large number of unemployed and social unrest are the main causes. Only 269 stray soldiers and vagrants have been taken in, which is insufficient. Orders have been issued to intensify efforts. During the winter defense period, transportation protection will be strengthened, with armed village police organizing villages within 20 miles on both sides of the roads to guard and patrol sections. Mobile police duties will be undertaken by the National Army, and signal flares will be used to report bandit activity. Over 70,000 civilian firearms have been registered throughout the province, and there are over 25,000 police officers. With the combined efforts of civilians and police, there is no need to fear the winter defense.</p>

<h3>Reporting Traitor Hui Xinke: Letter Sent to the Province for Investigation and Arrest</h3>
<p>Verdict on Zhu Han, the Pseudo County Magistrate of Taixian</p>

<h3>Commercial Slump and New Taxes Increase: Wuxi Business Community Requests Tax Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent] The guilds of seven industries in this county, including Chinese medicine, Western medicine, silk and cloth, printing, silver shops, food, and department stores, believe that the current commercial depression is a widespread phenomenon and that various expenses are difficult to list. Many businesses are struggling to survive, and business failures are happening one after another. Recently, the tax bureau has opened up regulations such as the collection of interest income tax, rental income tax, and salary income tax. Shops find it unbearable to bear these costs and are requesting relief. In particular, interest income tax is mostly due to merchants borrowing from households on a temporary basis for emergency needs. As for the interest already paid, it is impossible to recover the tax from households, so the merchants have to compensate for the payment. In addition, rental income tax has a similar structure with the current levy of property tax, and the tax amount is calculated on an annual basis instead of a monthly basis for this rental income tax collection, which is a very large rate. How can merchants and the public bear this loss? Furthermore, the salaries of employees in various shops are meager and far below the treatment of workers. If income tax is deducted, it will be even more difficult. Yesterday, a joint letter was sent to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to the authorities, expressing sympathy for the difficulties of merchants and requesting that the new taxes be temporarily suspended to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>

<h3>A Police Officer Writes a Letter Expressing Grievances</h3>
<p>First letter: We are all police officers standing in front of or downstairs of Guangshemen, and our families are suffering from the meager salaries we receive, suffering from cold and diseases... And what about us? Bravely running in the cold wind and rain, on icy and snowy ground, under the scorching sun, enduring and standing in our positions, what is it for? When there is a fire or bandits, we fight bravely, arresting... what is it for? A small number of conspirators want to create a tragedy using the vendor incident, and we use our own lives to protect the interests of the people, what is it for?</p>
<p>We certainly dare not claim credit, saying that we have fulfilled our responsibility, but we allow our families to suffer and complain, and we ourselves are enduring and struggling. In fact, it is because we want to take on part of the responsibility of a citizen to protect the security of society and the region, so although it is a little bitter, we feel a little comforted in spirit.</p>
<p>But some people say: "The police should serve the people, and should not have the psychology of managing the people." Is this not serving the people but managing the people? Should we serve bad elements or a small number of people, allowing them to disrupt or hinder the interests or security of the majority of people regardless of everything?</p>
<p>We shed blood for the benefit of the majority... I ask, who sympathizes with our burnt faces? Not only is there no sympathy or comfort, but we are subjected to slander from some people due to misunderstanding?</p>
<p>Gentlemen! Put yourself in our shoes and think about how angry and sad we would be, so we want to call out, we want to cry out, because we have been wronged? Because we have been subjected to unreasonable criticism, call out, cry out, and ask the wise gentlemen to give a little fair comfort! (A chief police officer representative from the Gaoqiao Police Station)</p>
<p>Second letter: I am a police officer, and also a loyal reader of your newspaper who must read it every day. In November, your newspaper published the good news of salary increases for civil servants, which tripled the original salary. But now I still only receive 101,500 yuan per month. Fair gentlemen; not only have we not received salary increases, but the five dou (a unit of volume) of yellow coarse rice that should be issued to us every month (October and November) has not been issued. With rising prices, how can a salary of 100,000 yuan allow the police to maintain their livelihoods? In addition, military blankets are distributed to high-ranking civil servants, but we have not only not received any, but we have also received no information. What is the authorities planning? The distribution is very nice to listen to, but each set requires 120,000 to 130,000 yuan. Please fair gentlemen think about it, if we buy a set, we would have to not eat for at least a month. Even if there are really cheap goods for distribution, where would we get the extra money to buy them? The police are the servants of the people, protecting the people's lives and property, allowing them to live and work in peace, but with our lives like this, fair gentlemen; give the police some sympathy! (Li Yaoxiang)</p>
<h3>Civil Servants Should Be Given Priority on Transportation</h3>
<p>In September of this year, the City Council meeting and the case of free military rides for civil servants have not been implemented to this day. It is well known that civil servants are poorly paid, there is no need to say more. With only one or two shuttle buses every day, limited by time and routes, it is impossible to pick up and drop off all civil servants scattered everywhere. Therefore, the number of people who can enjoy these shuttle buses is extremely small. Most people take streetcars or public buses themselves. In today's high bus ticket prices, every civil servant feels this problem acutely. Fortunately, the British and French streetcar companies have preferential measures for civil servants to take the bus, selling monthly tickets at 10,000 yuan each, which greatly benefits the poor civil servants. However, in places where streetcar routes cannot reach, public buses of the Public Utility Bureau must be taken. Since public buses are operated by the city, they should be even more preferential, but the opposite is true. When officials from the city government and its subordinate bureaus take the bus, they must buy tickets in accordance with the regulations, without any reduction, while employees of foreign streetcar companies in the same industry are able to board the bus without issue and without purchasing a ticket under reciprocal conditions. Civil servants should of course abide by the law absolutely and must buy a ticket to take the bus. However, with prices rising endlessly and with monthly income of only over 100,000 yuan and the burden of family support on one's shoulders, the cost of transportation accounts for nearly one-third of the total income, how can one bear it? Public buses are vastly different in organization and nature from foreign streetcar organizations. They should do everything possible to obtain welfare for civil servants. We no longer foolishly imagine the implementation of free bus rides by the Council, but we only request the Public Utility Bureau to swiftly instruct the public bus company to sell monthly tickets to civil servants taking public buses, following the example of the streetcar company, starting in January. That would be a great favor! (A small civil servant)</p>

<h3>British Ships Detonated Mines in the Corfu Strait: Britain Sends an Ultimatum to Albania, Demanding an Apology and Guaranteeing No Recurrence of the Same Incident. Will Appeal to the Security Council if No Satisfactory Response Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] It was announced here tonight: The British government has issued a strongly worded ultimatum to the Albanian government regarding the unwarranted attack on British warships in the Corfu Strait, resulting in loss of life and property, requiring it to formally apologize to Britain within fourteen days and demanding compensation for damages. If a satisfactory response is not received, the British government will submit the matter to the Security Council. The first incident occurred on May 15, when the British cruiser "Orion" and the superclass number were fired upon by Albanian coastal batteries while passing through the Strait, but fortunately, they were not damaged. Then, on October 22, the British destroyers "Saumarez" and "Volage" were severely damaged by underwater mines in the Strait, with as many as 44 officers and soldiers killed. Between the two incidents, merchant ships were also shot at while passing through the area. The British government's note pointed out that British minesweepers cleared mines in the area in November and discovered that these mines were laid shortly before the British destroyers had their accident. From the perspective of Albania's strict coastal defense, there is no way the Albanian authorities would not have known that mines were laid in the Strait. Therefore, the British government suspects that these mines were either laid by Albania itself, or that the Albanian government must have known that there were mines laid. Therefore, the Albanian government has seriously violated international law. The British government now specifically requests that the Albanian government formally apologize to the British government for the successive attacks on British warships and guarantee that the same incident will not occur again. The British government also requests that the Albanian government compensate for the damage suffered by the British warships on October 22 and pay full compensation to the families of the 44 deceased officers and soldiers. If the Albanian government does not provide a satisfactory response within fourteen days of the delivery of the note, the British government will regard Albania's actions as a serious threat to international peace and security and will file a lawsuit with the Security Council. The note was delivered to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade yesterday.</p>
<h3>Situations in the North Pacific and Mediterranean: Soviet Union Expresses Deep Concern; U.S. and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting; Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement on the Problem of the Port of Trieste</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 11th] U.S. Secretary of State James Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov held talks today, during which Molotov made extremely important statements. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union has a "direct concern" about the entire North Pacific region and the Mediterranean Sea, especially the management of islands and colonies in those areas. Molotov also proposed a method to resolve this issue, stating that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could exchange letters clarifying the Soviet side's requests and its recognized rights. In short, the Soviet Union has broken its silence and clearly expressed its deep concern about Palestine, Italy, Libya, and the islands of the North Pacific near the equator.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference temporarily stopped discussing the German problem last night while awaiting new instructions from Moscow regarding the procedures of the peace treaty, and instead discussed the Italian peace treaty. The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference is currently stepping up its work to clear outstanding matters in the coming days and adjourn before Christmas.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 10th] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference has reached an agreement on all issues related to the legal and territorial status of the Free Port of Trieste, except for one issue, which has been decided to be temporarily postponed. Experts who attended the Foreign Ministers' Conference and participated in the drafting of the Trieste plan said that if the economies of countries behind Trieste, such as Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, can be restored and a sufficient level of balance can be achieved, this step may enable the district to be self-sufficient within a few years. In short, the political system of Trieste can be summarized as follows: (1) The Port of Trieste will be opened as a free port, jointly ruled by the international community, but the political power is of an autonomous nature. (2) The free port will be ruled by the port governor, but this port governor must be nominated by the Trieste government committee and appointed by the chief executive of the district. (3) An international committee will be established, under the command of the port governor. The committee will be made up of a representative of the Trieste District, a representative each from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. The chairman will be a representative of the Trieste District.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Greek Complaint: Soviet Proposal Rejected; Discussion of Applications for Admission Extended</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council met today and discussed the issue of Siam's application for admission to the UN, deciding to postpone consideration until the next meeting. It immediately debated the Greek government's memorandum accusing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of supporting Greek guerrillas, pointing out that this situation has caused friction between Greece and its neighbors, and if not quickly rectified, may endanger international peace and security. It therefore requested a speedy investigation on the ground. Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Tsaldaris has personally come to New York to represent Greece.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] The Security Council discussed the Greek complaint today. The Soviet Union proposed inviting representatives of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to participate in the discussion immediately, but without the right to vote. The proposal was rejected. At the same time, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution inviting Greece to make a statement on the matter. It then discussed whether the Greek complaint was a "dispute" between Greece and its neighbors. It was immediately decided to postpone inviting representatives of Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the discussion until the Security Council decided on this issue. Finally, it was stipulated that Greece would participate in the discussion with Yugoslavia, but without the right to vote. The Security Council would invite Albania and Bulgaria to participate in the discussion when the Security Council determined that the issue was a "dispute."</p>
<h3>Independence for People in Trust Territories: Must Specify a Definite Date; Indian Representative Finally Withdraws Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 11th Broadcast: An Indian representative in a UN committee recently suggested that each of the eight trusteeship agreements currently under consideration specify a definite date by which the trusteeship country should relinquish all sovereignty in the trust territory. In other words, the Indian representative aimed to secure a definite period of time to allow the people of the trust territory to become independent. However, the countries in charge of the territories strongly opposed this suggestion, and the resolution was withdrawn. However, the Indian representative, Menon, stated that he would re-submit the case after the UN Trusteeship Council was formally established.</p>
<h3>The UN General Assembly Has Approved the Budget for This Year</h3>

<h3>UNRRA Holds Plenary Session, Emphasizes Future Relief Work, La Guardia Defends UNRRA Work, States Food Distribution Never Involved Politics</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] With UNRRA's European operations ending this month and East Asian operations ending in March next year, representatives from UNRRA's 48 member nations convened here today in a plenary session. Director-General La Guardia vigorously defended UNRRA's food distribution efforts, stating that any claims of political manipulation in UNRRA's food allocation are absolutely incorrect. "I am completely unaware of any political considerations in food distribution," he said. La Guardia recounted that all UNRRA food shipments were decided by a nine-nation management committee. He claimed he had never heard any government object to political influence in food allocation. La Guardia's statement was a response to Undersecretary of State Acheson's statement on Sunday, in which Acheson said some countries received too much aid while others received too little, which was a grave error.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 10th] UNRRA Director-General La Guardia today submitted a report on UNRRA's work for the third quarter of 1946 to the UNRRA Council's sixth session. According to the report, as of November 18th, UNRRA's work plan had been 72% completed. In total, UNRRA had shipped approximately 17,845,000 long tons (18,130,520 metric tons) of relief supplies, valued at $2,117,653,000. The main issue now is the continuation plan after UNRRA officially concludes relief efforts in Europe on December 31st of this year and in China on March 31st of next year.</p>
<h3>Investigation of National Armed Forces Becomes a Contentious Debate at the UN General Assembly, Nine Principles Agreed Upon Regarding Disarmament, Subcommittee Drafts Report for General Assembly Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] British representative Noel-Baker today urged Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the United Nations General Assembly to approve the investigation plan for both foreign and domestic troops, saying, "We might as well let the facts be known, lift the curtain, and see the situation in all countries around the world, thereby dispelling suspicion." "I ask the Soviet Union not to follow a policy of isolation, creating suspicion." Shaw also stated that Molotov was actually opposing his own proposal. When the Political Committee passed the troop investigation case with 34 votes to 7, the Soviet Union expressed its dissent, stating that the issue of investigating the number of domestic troops was only related to the general disarmament case. Earlier, U.S. Representative Connally also stated, "We have no secrets, we should make our entire military strength public to the world, and hope that other countries can do the same," but Connally reiterated his opposition to the British proposal for the Security Council to send an investigation team to verify the reports of troop numbers on the ground.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations General Assembly today continued to discuss the investigation of national armed forces. The Soviet representative agreed that an international organization should be responsible for investigating national armed forces, but insisted that the investigation of national armaments, including the atomic bomb, must be carried out simultaneously, merging the investigation of troops and armaments into one case. The British representative has "in principle" approved the method proposed by the Soviet Union. If this is passed by the General Assembly, the United States will inevitably have to make its atomic bomb secrets public immediately. The main point of contention at present is still the veto issue. The British representative insists that the international organization responsible for investigating national armed forces and armaments should not be bound by the veto power in the Security Council, while the Soviet representative argues the opposite. General Assembly President Spaak declared that if this motion is passed by the General Assembly, the entire organization for investigating national armed forces and armaments could be established by January 15th of next year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 10th] The drafting subcommittee of the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee is scheduled to hold its final meeting tomorrow to draft a report to be submitted to the Political and Security Committee, which, if passed, will then be submitted to the UN General Assembly for discussion. However, according to well-informed sources, agreements have been reached on all the key points to be included in the draft resolution, including: (1) Accelerating the work of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; (2) The Security Council should promptly review the reports submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission; (3) Recognizing the need to limit and reduce national armaments and armed forces; (4) Drafting agreements to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; (5) Establishing an international control agency under the jurisdiction of the Security Council, whose powers and duties will also be stipulated by the Security Council's agreement, but must be approved by all member states of the United Nations; (6) All member states of the United Nations should immediately place their necessary troops under the command of the Security Council to form an international army; (7) The troops of the United Nations member states stationed within the borders of former enemy countries should be gradually withdrawn according to progressive and proportional percentages; (8) The troops of the United Nations member states stationed within the borders of non-enemy countries should be withdrawn unless they have obtained the consent of the latter's government; (9) All countries should universally reduce their armed forces. Regarding the last point, the subcommittee discussed it for a long time, because it not only stipulated that domestic armed forces should be reduced, but also that the troops gradually withdrawn by member states from other countries should also be reduced. Finally, the British representative put forward an amendment requiring the United Nations to provide accurate information on their armaments and military strength, which was then passed by the subcommittee.</p>
<h3>The UN and the Universal Postal Union are Discussing a Draft Agreement</h3>

<h3>Iranian Government Troops Penetrate Deep into Azerbaijan Province, Capture the Important City of Mianeh, Britain Reiterates Non-Interference in Iranian Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 11th] According to reports, government troops, which entered Azerbaijan province to monitor the elections, have occupied Mianeh, southwest of Tabriz, the capital, about 200 kilometers from Tabriz. Frontline reports from Azerbaijan state that the news of the government troops occupying Mianeh after fierce fighting with the Azerbaijan Democratic Forces is likely to be true. If the city has been occupied, it means that the government troops have advanced 30 miles. The report also stated that the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sachekov, strongly protested to Prime Minister Sultaneh against the Iranian government's military actions, accusing the Iranian government of violating its promises by sending troops into Azerbaijan, which threatens the Soviet border. It is said that the Iranian Prime Minister is constantly being pressured by the Soviet side to stop military operations. Parliamentary elections have now begun in other parts of Iran, but elections in Azerbaijan will be held only when government forces are able to control the voting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated previous statements, declaring that the movement of Iranian troops within its own territory is purely an internal matter for the Iranian government. The spokesman denied rumors that the deployment of troops by the Iranian central government into Azerbaijan was based on British advice. When reporters asked whether the British government would still consider this an internal matter if war broke out in Azerbaijan, the answer was that the British government certainly believes that the turmoil within Iran should be resolved by the Iranian government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Concern</h3>

<h3>Difficulties Abound in the New Egyptian Cabinet, Minister of Social Affairs Refuses to Take Office, Cairo's Security is Unstable and Tense, Future of Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Difficult to Be Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 10th] In response to the recent bombings and arson incidents, the authorities today ordered the police to shoot and kill anyone suspicious lurking in public places, in front of the residences of ministers and senior officials. In addition, it is learned that the new cabinet organized by Prime Minister Nokrashi was unable to be sworn in before King Farouk today because the newly appointed Minister of Social Affairs, Yarobaghan, resolutely refused to accept the position of minister. According to Yarobaghan, he was not consulted, so he cannot accept it. He always refused to sign an agreement with Britain in the previous cabinet, and he still insists on this view now.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Responsible political observers say that judging from the inaugural speech of the new Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi, the differences between Britain and Egypt regarding the future status of Sudan will continue to exist. Nokrashi said that his cabinet will lead the Sudanese to establish an autonomous government and be permanently unified with Egypt under the Egyptian king. Some believe that this is a formal explanation of the Sudan portion of the Bevin-Sidky Anglo-Egyptian draft. However, the idea of not allowing the Sudanese to be independent, but of permanently merging them with Egypt, has been rejected by both the Sudanese Governor-General Huddleston and the London Foreign Office. Since the British government has no tendency to abandon its position, it is expected that the Bevin-Sidky agreement will be difficult to serve as the basis for Anglo-Egyptian treaty amendment negotiations.</p>

Vincent claimed in court that he was originally scheduled to play a certain role in a play with the Old Vic Company, but was suddenly fired, and suspected that Laurence Olivier was deliberately making things difficult for him.</p>

<h3>Difficult Birth of French Prime Minister, Third Vote Postponed Again</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The National Assembly was originally scheduled to hold a third vote to elect the Prime Minister at 3:00 PM today, but because the leaders of the various French parties failed to reach an agreement, it has been decided to postpone the vote.</p>
<h3>US Denies Decision to Reduce Compensation Plan Demanded from Japan, Japan is About to Announce Five-Year Economic Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch] US State Department personnel today denied rumors that the final plan for the amount of reparations the United States demanded from Japan was less than that requested by Pauley from Japanese industry. It is said that the reparations plan is still in the preparatory stage, and there is currently no final decision. It is not yet known whether it will be more or less than the Pauley plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] According to Japanese sources, the report on the Pauley plan for Japanese reparations, scheduled to be reported in Japan, has been postponed indefinitely in order to avoid causing international repercussions. It is said that the Japanese government is afraid that this will lead other countries to believe that Japan is planning to reduce the reparations conditions just as they are about to be announced.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese government is about to announce the Five-Year Economic Construction Plan for 1945-1950. This plan will be based on the production of coal and hydropower, stipulating that 35 million tons of coal will be produced in 1950, which is equal to 80% of the 1937 level. Leaders from all walks of life in Japan firmly believe that the future of Japan lies in industry and foreign trade, not in democracy. The major issue at present is the reparations plan, and Pauley's reparations plan gives a clear concept of Japan's economic future.</p>
<h3>Billis Awarded US Gold Medal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th United Press] Former Prime Minister of Greece, Villis, was awarded the Gold Palm Calcium Leaf Medal by US Secretary of the Army Patterson for his meritorious anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<h3>Commander of US Fleet Discusses Future Wars, Arctic is Important, Coast Should Also be Emphasized</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Lieutenant General Barber, Commander of the Fourth Fleet and expert on Pacific landing warfare, discussed the trends of future wars today. According to him, if the United States is attacked by weapons of mass destruction in the future, it may suffer 5 million casualties within a few hours. But the enemy cannot defeat us all at once. Within hours, our country will implement a large-scale retaliatory attack. The United States is at least ten years ahead of other countries in the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, but we must continue to make progress. Military progress is the most powerful guarantee behind the success of the United Nations. If war breaks out again one day, it will never be a gentleman's duel, but a question of the existence of civilized people. In general, people value attacks coming across the Arctic, but I don't know why. I think it is more likely that foreign countries will send a dozen submarines and atomic bombs from locations hundreds of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean to the cities of the US East Coast. Rocket-type atomic bombs can still be launched even after the submarine sinks, but our retaliation will also be swift, and the enemy cannot avoid it and will suffer greater losses.</p>
<h3>China and India (Middle)</h3>
<p>— (Written by Nehru)</p>
<p>Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Correspondent of this Newspaper in India</p>
<p>Xuanzang tells us a lot about Nalanda University, and other records are similar. In the past few years, I have been to Nalanda University and was amazed to see a wide range of relics systematically excavated from the ruins. Only a small part has been excavated to this day and is still inhabited by people, but these places still include vast gardens surrounded by solemn stone houses.</p>
<p>Soon after Xuanzang passed away in China, another traveler, Monk Yijing, came to India. He set off from China in 671 AD and took two full years to reach the port of Derari in India, which is the mouth of the Hooghly River. He came by sea and stopped in Palembang (in Sumatra) for several months to study Chuwen. This decision to travel by sea was of profound significance, perhaps due to changes in the political situation that made Central Asia unstable and unable to come by land. Several Buddhist monasteries along the way were places for them to stop and rest. The sea route may have also been more suitable for the growth of India's colonies in Indonesia and for India to develop regular commercial relations with other countries. Records from Yijing and others show that at this time, there was regular navigation between Iran, India, Malaya, Sumatra and China. Yijing took a Persian ship from Guangzhou and initially arrived in Sumatra.</p>
<p>Yijing also studied at Nalanda University for a long time and brought back thousands of volumes of Sanskrit classics. His main interest lies in the key points of Buddhist rituals and rules, and he recorded these matters in great detail. He also told us a lot about clothing, food, and customs. The main food in North India is wheat, as it is now, while East India mainly eats rice. Although meat is sometimes eaten, it is also rare. Ghee, milk, and other things can be seen everywhere, and there are many biscuits and fruits. What Yijing recorded as very important to the Indians is relying on the purity of a certain specific religious ritual "Now the first most important difference between the five Indias and other countries is the sincerity of religious rituals. Moreover, "Food left over, which can be stored in China, may not be in accordance with Indian regulations."</p>
<p>Yijing talked about India, calling it the West, but he himself told us that India is named Aryadesha. The meaning of Arya is competition. The meaning of Desha is soil, which is competing soil - each is the West. The reason for this name is that the character of its people is noble and pure, and all the people praise this land with this name. India is also called "Middle Land" Madhyadesha because it is located in the center of a hundred teaching countries. All the people feel very close to this name. The northern barbarians (such as the Huns, Mongols, Turks) uniquely call the Pure Land India, but this is not a common term after all. This is just a name used locally and has no special meaning. The people of India do not know this name, and the most appropriate name for India is "Pure Land".</p>
<p>Yijing's discussion of Shendu is very interesting. He said, "Some people say that the meaning of India Indu is the moon, and the Chinese call India India, which comes from this. Although its meaning may be like this, this is not a common name. Or if the Indians call China Zhina, it is just a name and has no special meaning." He also mentioned the names used in Sanskrit for Korea and other countries.</p>
<p>Yijing had the utmost respect for India, and the same was true for things in India. He described these things in detail and first gave them to his motherland - China. India may be a "Pure Land", but China is a "Divine Land". "The people of the Five Indias are very proud of their sincerity and nobility. However, the emphasis on thought, writing, cultivation, composure, correct attitude, peaceful demeanor, etiquette for welcoming and sending, the taste of food and soup, and a kind and just mind can only be obtained in China, not in other countries." The healing of acupuncture and the subtlety of feeling the pulse cannot be replaced anywhere in India, and the extension of life with medicine can only be seen in China... Judging from the character of people and the quality of things, China is called Divine Land. Can any of the Five Indias not respect China?"</p>
<p>The ancient Sanskrit term for the Chinese emperor was Deva-Putra, whose accurate translation is "Son of Heaven".</p>
<p>Yijing himself was a Sanskrit scholar, he praised Sanskrit, and he also said that in the more distant countries of the north and south, this language is also respected: there are even some people from the Divine Land (China) and Paradise (India) who teach the rules of this language: Sanskrit scholars in China must have been extremely common. We find it interesting that some Chinese scholars wanted to use Sanskrit phonemes in the Chinese language. A good example is the Tang Dynasty Chinese monk Suwen, who wanted to make the Chinese language into an alphabetic phonetic system in this direction. As Indian Buddhism waned, although there were often pilgrims from China visiting the Buddhist holy sites in India, in fact, the exchanges between scholars from the two countries had ended. When the political revolution took place in the 11th century AD, all Buddhist monks carried their scriptures and went to Nepal, or crossed the Himalayas to Tibet. We already knew that the important parts of ancient Indian literature had reached China and Tibet, and in recent years they have been found there completely in their original form, and there are quite a few translations as well. Many ancient Indian classics, not only those related to Buddhism, but also those related to Brahmanism, astronomy, arithmetic, and medicine, are still preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. The best example of this scholarly connection that still exists today is the dictionary of Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese Buddhist terms. This book was written around the 9th or 10th century AD and is called the Great Dictionary Mahavyutpatti.</p>

<h3>Lu Jingshi Convened Representatives of Textile Workers to Discuss the Distribution of Year-End Bonuses, Labor Expresses Concessions, Hoping to Still Follow Past Practices, Social Affairs Bureau Will Convene Talks with Business Leaders</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Lu Jingshi, Director of the Organization and Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, yesterday afternoon convened representatives of cotton textile workers at the meeting room of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange views on the issue of year-end bonuses. Director Lu told reporters that the workers hope to receive a year-end bonus of six months' salary because the profits of the cotton textile industry are very high; however, the business side believes that yarn prices have been restricted and profits are limited, and although the books show cheap money, they have not increased when calculated in terms of materials, and cannot accept the workers' demands. After his persuasion, the labor side is willing to make considerable concessions, but at a minimum, they hope to follow past practices and divide the workers' year-end bonuses into 20%, 25%, and 33% of their total annual income, with production workers getting 20% and management personnel getting 30%. The so-called total annual income refers to the actual income after deducting holidays. I believe that the labor and management sides of the cotton textile industry will be able to work together harmoniously and reach an agreement on this issue under the principles of maintaining production and protecting labor. Furthermore, according to labor representatives, yesterday's meeting was an informal exchange of views, and the labor side has put forward its views as much as possible for reference. Lu will return to Beijing tomorrow and will come to Shanghai again on the 21st of this month. At that time, there should be a concrete resolution on the year-end bonus issue for the cotton textile industry.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the standing directors of the city's General Labor Union, industry associations, and the City Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on the 13th of this month (Friday). Notices have already been issued, hoping that all will attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Relief for the Unemployed Postponed to Next Week</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau originally scheduled a meeting yesterday to discuss a plan to provide relief for unemployed workers, but it was temporarily unable to be held due to unforeseen circumstances and it was decided to postpone it to next Monday. According to Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the bureau, the workers' hostel was originally scheduled to accommodate more than 1,000 workers, but the actual number of people currently accommodated is more than 1,800. Due to overcrowding, environmental hygiene has been greatly affected, resulting in more than ten workers' children dying from smallpox in November. At the meeting next week, discussions will be held on how to improve the medical and health facilities of the hostel, and the issue of raising funds for this. As for the placement of unemployed workers, Li believes that the symptomatic solution is to enable factories that have already started work to maintain operations, and to enable those that have not started work to resume operations as soon as possible. The fundamental solution is to improve the entire national economy to increase employment opportunities.</p>
<h3>Patrolling and Inspecting Restricted Construction Areas, Gently Persuading Residents to Demolish Shanties, Over 100 Acres of Vacant Land in Five Locations Approved for Shantytown Residents to Rent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Municipal Council's decision to ban illegally constructed shanties within the city's restricted construction zones, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, acting under orders, commenced patrol and enforcement operations yesterday in conjunction with the Police Bureau.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the two bureaus formed a joint patrol team, led by Song Xueqin, Section Chief of the Demolition Section of the Bureau of Public Works, and Lu Xia, Section Chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau, with six police officers and six artisans. Before the patrol team set out, Zhao Shekang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, convened a briefing, instructing all personnel to persuade shantytown residents to demolish their structures with sincerity and kindness, explaining the reasons for the demolition, the public interest involved, and the resettlement measures to be taken, ensuring that residents have a way out. In the morning, the patrol team inspected along Changning Road and Kaixuan Road, and in the afternoon, they visited Yangshupu and the Suzhou Creek area. More structures were found in the Yangshupu area, while the situation on other roads was better. When the patrol team encountered a few shantytown residents constructing houses, they explained the demolition order. The residents were very cooperative and agreed to demolish their structures within two or three days. The artisans and police officers accompanying the team did not forcibly demolish any structures yesterday but issued warnings that if the structures were not demolished within the allotted time, the authorities would demolish them on their behalf.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Works, accompanied by Wang Yuankang, Director of the Construction Division, personally inspected Changshou Road, Xikang Road, Yuyao Road, Yichang Road, and Jiangning Road yesterday morning. The most construction was found on Yuyao Road (formerly Singapore Road), where most of the shanties in the central district were built on roads or in alleyways. Director Zhao will personally inspect the Yangshupu district again today. A reporter interviewed Director Zhao yesterday, inquiring about the measures for dealing with shantytowns. He stated that shanties under construction in the restricted areas would be demolished and that residents should build in non-restricted areas. Furthermore, according to urban planning, the Municipal Government has approved the transfer of instructions to the Bureau of Land Administration to purchase private land in five locations for the construction of affordable housing villages, totaling 163 acres. These locations are: 21 acres on Feihong Road in Yangshupu, 45 acres in Caojiadu in the Pusong District, 40.8 acres on Tianyaoqiao Road in the Hunan District, 15.6 acres in Yangjiapo in Pudong, and 40.8 acres on Zhaoju Road in the Hunan District. This land was originally intended to be included in next year's budget for the construction of affordable housing villages. However, before funding is secured, shantytown residents may be allowed to select and rent vacant land.</p>
<p>The Bureau previously constructed over 100 affordable housing units in Damuqiao in the Nanshi district. Currently, besides being rented by a small number of citizens, the remaining units are occupied by municipal government employees. Director Zhao also stated that to align with urban planning, building construction must be zoned. Building dormitories near factories could alleviate the housing shortage to some extent. Residential and commercial areas should also be zoned separately. Director Zhao also inspected bottle-neck shaped protruding houses in the city yesterday and will submit this issue for discussion at the next Municipal Council meeting.</p>

<h3>Road Repair Work Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the city's road repair projects, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, told reporters yesterday that the main road construction projects in the city have been completed, totaling 120,000 square meters. The repair of branch roads is also actively underway. According to the Bureau's plan, from the first day of this month to February of next year, within three months, 100,000 square meters of branch roads will be repaired. Roads that have been completed include Fansi Ferry Road, Central Lin Sen Road, and Central Fuxing Road. Roads that are about to be constructed include Yunnan Road, Shandong Road, Guangxi Road, Qiujiang Road, North Xizang Road, and Zha Pu Road. It is claimed that if the road repair funds allocated by the Municipal Government next year are sufficient, the roads in the central city, including the British and French Concession areas, can be fully repaired from April to December next year. As for all the roads in the city, including the suburbs, it is hoped that they can be repaired within two years.</p>
<h3>Launching Winter Relief Fund, Speaker Pan Takes the Lead, Municipal Council Begins Fundraising</h3>
<p>Recently, cold weather has struck Shanghai. Yesterday was an entire day of wind and rain. Impoverished people suffering from cold and hunger are dying daily. Although the Municipal Government has actively raised funds, the amount is limited and cannot benefit all the poor. In view of this, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council, believes that it is necessary to mobilize all citizens of Shanghai to assist in order to be effective. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Municipal Council instructing them to assist the government in actively launching winter relief efforts to achieve the goal of serving the people. Speaker Pan himself took the lead by donating all of the council's travel expenses of over 500,000 yuan to the relief effort. It is reported that the council has already complied and plans to start fundraising today. It is also hoped that various legal entities will participate together to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>The Opera "Meng Jiangnu" Performs Successfully, Madame Chiang Holds Tea Party to Thank Patrons, Mei Lanfang Critiques Performance, Fei Xi Praises the Plot</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, Madame Chiang Song Meiling held a tea party at the second guest house of the Lixingshe to thank the Shanghai patrons of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera, which was performed to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the school for orphans of National Revolutionary Army soldiers. Foreign guest Fei Xi, Mayor Wu and his wife, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiqing, Wu Shaodui, Xuan Tiewu, Huang Renlin, Wei Jingmeng, Xi Yushu, Ding Guitang, Liu Gongyun, Xu Xueyu, Cao Jun, Mei Lanfang, Wang Bosheng, Deng Shiping, Guo Linsuang, Liu Jingji, Zhang Rongchu, Shen Dexie, Wang Zhaohuai, Zhang Chu, and over 20 others attended. Despite the heavy rain, Madame Chiang arrived on time, shook hands and exchanged greetings with the guests, and was in a very pleasant mood. After light refreshments were served, Madame Chiang first consulted Dr. Mei Lanfang and Wang Bosheng, president of the National Academy of Drama, separately, on their criticisms of the content of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera. Both believed that apart from some minor improvements needed in the performance techniques, the plot's meaning was profound and well represented a part of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Huang Renlin, the general secretary, reported briefly that he was very grateful for the enthusiastic fundraising by all sectors of society for the Shanghai performance of the "Meng Jiangnu" opera. Based on the observations of the continuous performances, the total income may reach 400 million yuan. Among all the patrons, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Xu Jikang provided the most assistance. Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Wang Bosheng provided the most active guidance, which made such success possible, which was a rare opportunity. The performance on the 10th night was sold out. The closing night was originally scheduled for the 11th, but to satisfy the audience's interests, an additional performance was added on the 12th, and the daytime ticket prices were reduced to 2,000 and 4,000 yuan, and the evening ticket prices were reduced to 5,000 and 10,000 yuan so that ordinary citizens could enjoy the performance. After Mr. Huang finished his report, Madame Chiang gave a speech.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang then delivered a speech, saying that the "Meng Jiangnu" opera had achieved great success in Shanghai. She not only represented the orphan school in expressing her gratitude to all of you for fundraising for the education fund for our orphans, but also felt that it was deeply meaningful and heartwarming that Chinese culture could be introduced to foreign countries through the "Meng Jiangnu" opera, which would increase international understanding. After the "Meng Jiangnu" opera was performed, she and the Chairman watched it four times and felt that the content of the play was much improved compared to ordinary old plays. General Marshall was also interested in the play and often talked about it, which proved that the play could attract many audiences if it was performed abroad.</p>
<p>Patrons then expressed their opinions one by one on how to improve the play, which can be summarized as follows: (1) The music must be coordinated with the movements, (2) The actress playing Meng Jiangnu is too old, (3) Gods and ghosts are mixed together, and the movements are chaotic, (4) The makeup needs to be improved to distinguish between good and evil. Finally, Madame Chiang asked foreign guest Fei Xi for his opinion. He said that the plot was very good and hoped that it could be performed in Washington, New York, and other places in the United States. Madame Chiang expressed her agreement. Then, Huang, the general secretary, concluded by saying that everyone's enthusiastic support not only made a great contribution to cultural work, but also laid the foundation for the special nature of the orphan school. He expressed his great gratitude to everyone. The guests chatted happily until about 6:00 PM before the party broke up. After the meeting, Madame Chiang, accompanied by Huang Renlin, inspected each scene in the guest house for a week before taking a car back to her official residence on Dongping Road to rest. At 8:30 PM, Madame Chiang went to the Nanjing Grand Theater to watch the "Meng Jiangnu" performance again. She was very interested and returned home at the end of the show.</p>
<h3>Head of the Troupe Says Number of Performers will be Reduced When Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Also, Deng Shiping, general manager of the China Youth Music Troupe, told reporters that the opera had been performed at the Lixingshe in Nanjing for nine days since November 6, attracting a large audience. The ticket prices were divided into two types: 10,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan, and the total income was over 100 million yuan. The opera has been performed in Shanghai since December 5, and the ticket prices are divided into three types: 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan. The total income will be calculated after the performance is completed. The results are generally good. However, there are still many shortcomings in the plot content and performance techniques. He hopes that people from all walks of life will give more guidance and support. The troupe will sincerely accept and earnestly improve. When asked about the total number of actors, he said that there are 35 actors, and about 60 people including the opera affairs. In the future, if the opera is performed abroad, the number of people will still be reduced as much as possible.</p>
<h3>President Song Returns to Nanjing After Finishing Public Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] President Song, after coming to Shanghai to negotiate with the banking, financial, industrial, and commercial sectors to finalize the production loan and eliminate the cotton note black market plan, took a China Airlines flight back to Nanjing with his secretary and adjutant yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Meeting with Taixu in the Jade Buddha Temple, Abbot Jiasha of the Buddhist Order Looks Gloomy</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] In the cold rain, with the chanting of Buddhist scriptures, the Jade Buddha Temple looked even more quiet, solemn, and serene.</p>
<p>Master Songyue led us through a corridor, on the rear side of the Grand Hall, stopping in front of a quiet room. He stepped forward and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"This is the venerable Master Taixu."</p>
<p>Venerable Master Taixu was wearing a brownish-yellow monk's robe, with the cuffs of a white flannel shirt protruding from the sleeves. He wore a wool cap, also dark brown. Behind the tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses were a pair of kind and happy eyes, smiling at us. He extended his plump and elegant hand for a warm handshake. We sat down on the comfortable sofas. Master Songyue sat quietly on a chair nearby, listening.</p>
<p>The Buddhist order prohibits killing, and with the prospect of a large-scale fratricidal war looming, the conversation naturally turned to the current situation. The venerable master seemed to hesitate for a moment and said slowly, "Since the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the Kuomintang finally won the War of Resistance. In fact, the whole country should have been able to rest and recuperate, and things should have settled down. Who knew—that negotiations would fail to yield results, leading to this state of affairs!"</p>
<p>The venerable master lowered his head, unable to help but nod.</p>
<p>Buddhist Monks Forming a Party</p>
<p>We changed the subject: "Recently, there has been talk about Buddhist monks forming a party. What is your opinion on this, Venerable Master?"</p>
<p>"I discussed this issue in the first issue of the Juequn Weekly. Zhongshan Xisheng said that political power belongs to all the people, and monks and nuns are also people. They should ask about political affairs. We can participate in elections, go to the Senate, the Provincial Assembly, or the National Assembly—but I do not advocate forming a party."</p>
<p>Master Taixu has always been very concerned about Buddhist education. In Chongqing, he presided over the Haizang Buddhist Academy, which played a significant role in the border areas.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tibetan Buddhism, I could not help but think of Esoteric Buddhism, because the various miracles of Living Buddha Nuona in Shanghai were too strange. The master said: Esoteric Buddhism is indeed a bit strange, but it is indeed Mahayana Buddhism. Some strange things can be called "techniques," but what the Haizang Buddhist Academy studies are "teachings," are "learning."</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Incident</p>
<p>In the morning, we talked about the Jing'an Temple incident, which has attracted much attention.</p>
<p>Master Taixu scratched his head, already full of silver threads. He said firmly:</p>
<p>"I think this matter includes two parts. The first part is the matter of Dewu and Mijia being reported as traitors. To be honest, these two people cannot really be considered traitors. If anyone who participated in a people's organization once or twice during the enemy-puppet period is considered a traitor, I am afraid that there are four or five million people in the occupied areas who should be reported. The second part is the issue of how to manage Jing'an Temple and its property. I feel that the previous management system of temples is no longer suitable for modern times. The Haizang Buddhist Academy that I established in Chongqing was originally a dilapidated temple, because the management of the temple was poor and it was severely damaged. Later, when the academy was established, a board of directors was formed to manage the temple property, and a dedicated person was hired to be responsible for the academy's affairs, which led to success. I believe that the temple property of Jing'an Temple can also be managed by organizing a board of directors, and hospitals, libraries, or schools can be established on the temple grounds, and dedicated personnel can be hired to be responsible for administrative affairs—it can be operated as a business run by Buddhists. This may be a more appropriate method."</p>
<p>On Abbot Liugen</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple is currently managed by Abbot Liugen, but the master clearly believes that the current method is not a fundamental solution. He said: "In the future, when Dewu and the others return, there will definitely be disputes. Liugen is a useless and incompetent person. He also presided over Jing'an Temple in the early years of the Republic, but he has never managed it well since he came, and lawsuits have never stopped. Therefore, the fundamental management method must be improved."</p>
<p>The master is already fifty-eight years old this year. In recent years, because of high blood pressure, he cannot write too much or speak too much. Soon, he may go to Ningbo once. The National Buddhist Association meeting to be held in Nanjing next year will also be presided over by the master.</p>
<p>When leaving the Jade Buddha Temple, dusk in the rain was already very bleak.</p>

<h3>Christian Conference Concludes Successfully After Week-Long Meeting Gathering Representatives from Various Regions</h3>
<p>The 12th National Delegates Conference of the National Christian Council of China, which opened in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month, concluded successfully yesterday after a week-long session. Delegates from as far as the nine northeastern provinces attended, making it the largest gathering in more than a decade. Leading churches in England, the United States, and Canada also sent representatives to participate, discussing how to advance the plan and seeking to send one hundred newly trained specialized technical personnel to China next year to assist in all construction plans, including experts such as musicians, scientists, educators, and social workers. Many insightful proposals were made by various groups. In response to the Chairman's call to engage in spiritual construction, the council specifically decided to launch a three-year national endeavor movement starting next year, concentrating all talents and resources to promote the success of the endeavor movement and improve the spiritual life of the people. Other proposals included welcoming missionaries to China to assist in their work, intensifying the training of talents, raising the salaries of staff, improving the methods of advanced studies, strengthening cooperation in various undertakings, paying attention to assisting in the promotion of national education, developing work in border areas, and planning the publication of a Christian Daily News, totaling dozens of proposals. Before the closing ceremony, the council also elected Liang Xiaoye as president, and Jiang Changchuan, Cui Xianxiang, Zhao Zizhen, Bao Zheqing, and others as members. In addition to issuing a declaration, the conference sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang to pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply Has Improved, Sources Being Actively Developed, 6,000 Tons of Annam Anthracite Coal to Arrive</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: In order to prevent the black market for coal in the city, the method of allocating coal to factories has been improved this month. Previously, the required quantity of coal for each factory was applied for by the coal industry association on behalf of its members. Now, factories directly submit applications with the actual required quantity. The association then reviews and allocates the coal. This can help factories increase production to meet demand and avoid the association manipulating the allocation. In addition, it can naturally reduce black market prices. As for anthracite coal, it is estimated that 6,000 tons may arrive from Annam on the 15th. Furthermore, the Committee had negotiated with coal mines in the Annam and had secured agreement for a substantial quantity. Unless there are unexpected twists and turns, 6,000 tons can be shipped to China each month, with the first batch arriving by the end of the month. As for lump coal, there is a shortage in various countries after the war, and merchants are free to purchase it. The Committee had previously negotiated with the United States to purchase 10,000 tons. If the dockworkers' strike in that area is resolved, the coal can be shipped. The allocation method will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Relief of Coal Shortage Depends on Increasing Supply</p>
<p>The person in charge continued: In order to solve the current difficulty of raw materials for coal briquettes, in addition to ensuring a regular supply of raw materials, another 2,000 tons of small anthracite coal blocks will be added this month to the coal briquette industry association to supplement the raw materials. Regarding the elimination of the general black market problem, it is still hoped that the local government will do its best to assist. The person in charge finally stated: The relief of the coal shortage depends on increasing supply, the most important of which is the transportation problem. According to the past, the arrival of goods from various places was ideal from March to September, but the performance in October and November was poor. Within the scope of ability, efforts will be made to strengthen it as much as possible. In addition to maintaining 140,000 to 150,000 tons per month from opening resources and more than 50,000 tons from Taiwan, which are allocated to traffic, hydropower institutions, and factories in the valley, the National Resources Commission is paying unusual attention to coal production. It is estimated that the Northeast can produce 5 million tons next year, and one-fifth can be transported for use within the customs. As soon as Huludao thaws next spring, it can begin. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine, which can produce 1,000 tons of anthracite coal per day, has been recovered by the National Army and is actively producing. The mine has 140,000 tons of coal in stock, but unfortunately, the railway from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang has not been repaired, and the road is long and the train transportation is difficult. Arrangements have been made with the UNRRA authorities to transport the coal by truck from the producing area to Xinxiang.</p>
<h3>"Jiang Ya" Ship Repairs Boilers, "An Shun" Ship Clears Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route is operated by the "Jiang Ya" and "Jiang Jing" ships. The "Jiang Ya" ship is currently out of service for boiler repairs and is expected to be repaired within this week and resume service next week. Therefore, only the "Jiang Jing" ship operates between Shanghai and Ningbo. Other ships on this route, such as the "Da Hua" and "Jiang Su", operate as usual. The "Cai E" ship of the Beiyang Shanghai-Tianjin route returned to Shanghai last Saturday. It was originally scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 10th, but the bow cabin was damaged and is being repaired. It is scheduled to sail to Tianjin tomorrow. The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's "An Shun" ship left Shanghai on October 2, 1941 (i.e., the 30th year of the Republic), carrying cargo and passengers, via Xiamen and Hong Kong, to Singapore and Penang. A fire broke out en route and was extinguished, with some damage to the cargo. The company entrusted Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to apportion the water damage costs. At that time, each merchant paid a water damage guarantee deposit of 20%. However, the process was suspended due to the Japanese invasion of the South Seas and the tense war situation. Now that victory has been achieved, in order to clear the procedures, the company has decided that from the 16th of this month, anyone holding a water damage guarantee deposit receipt can register with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. until June 30 of next year. After the registration procedures are completed, the water damage apportionment method will be agreed upon.</p>
<h3>The City's Stadium is in Ruins, Visiting in the Rain Makes it Feel Even More Bleak, Chief of the Ordnance Department Ordered to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 10:00 AM yesterday, Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply Area of the Rear Service Headquarters, led his subordinates, together with Ling Chengxu, Deputy Director of the First Division of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Yan Zi of the Shanghai East Intelligence Office of the Garrison Headquarters, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers, to re-examine the site of the explosion at the old Jiangwan Stadium. At the time, the wind and rain were bleak, and the sky was gloomy. The four charred corpses beside the western grandstand looked even more tragic under the wash of the wind and rain. Commander Fu led the inspection of the explosion site for a week. Fearing that there might be unexpected dangers, he did not continue the excavation and drove back.</p>
<p>[Another News] Shang Jihui, Chief of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of National Defense, was ordered by Chief of Staff Chen to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth of this explosion and arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday. He immediately discussed the aftermath with Commander Chang and others in detail in the evening.</p>
<h3>Relevant Parties to Hold Meeting, Disappearance of Warehouse Manager Increases Difficulty of Investigation</h3>
<p>According to sources from relevant parties yesterday, the personnel specially sent by the relevant agencies to Shanghai to investigate the case may hold a meeting in the next few days to exchange opinions. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially interviewed someone in charge of investigating the case yesterday and was told that the truth about the fire and the exact cause of the fire are still unclear. No one witnessed the situation at the time of the incident. Although the warehouse worker who escaped last claimed that the fire was caused by a series of grenade explosions in the warehouse, this was only based on the sound of the explosions, and the situation could not be completely understood. In addition, the disappearance of the warehouse manager Wang Renshan and the warehouse staff Wu Rulin has made the investigation of the case more difficult. Based on the situation at the time, it is judged that Wang Renshan and others are unlikely to have been killed. If they are fleeing out of fear of crime, if Wang and others can come forward and surrender and explain the daily handling situation, this can add to the clues for the investigation. In short, the truth about the incident is still under strict investigation to reveal the truth.</p>
<h3>Qian Changzhao Inspects South China, Departs for Taiwan This Morning</h3>

<h3>Exemption from Transportation Business Tax, Inland River Shipping Continues to Strive</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association, previously faced with the issue of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau levying business tax on the shipping industry, which caused a strong reaction and led to repeated appeals to the authorities, has now heard that the Ministry of Finance's reply forwarded by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has been rejected. The association immediately convened an emergency meeting and unanimously decided to continue to strive for exemption to avoid the disastrous consequences of overtaxing shipping merchants, and if necessary, will unite with all relevant parties to petition the authorities in Beijing for a final effort.</p>
<h3>The Ugly Drama of the Disappearance Case Before the August 13th Incident: Miyazaki Sadao Appears in Japan After Ten Years of Imprisonment in China</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Recent news from Japan indicates that a man named Miyazaki Sadao has resurfaced.</p>
<p>Who is Miyazaki Sadao?</p>
<p>On July 24th of the 26th year of the Republic of China, just seventeen days after the July 7th Incident and nine days before August 22nd, Shanghai was at its most tense. Suddenly, at ten o'clock that night, two Japanese officers reported to the Disraeli Road Police Station that a private first class, Miyazaki Sadao, was missing during the roll call of the Japanese Marines that evening.</p>
<p>The Japanese military requested an investigation from the authorities while the Marines immediately dispatched soldiers to patrol, block traffic, and inspect pedestrians, creating a very tense situation.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of Shanghai at the time, notified the Japanese Consul General Okamoto, asking him to act cautiously and avoid further agitating the public.</p>
<p>However, how did the Japanese side react?</p>
<p>Major newspapers in Tokyo reported the news in special, large-print editions. Japanese warships, led by the "Izumo" cruiser, sailed into the Wusongkou port one after another.</p>
<p>By the 26th, the situation had calmed down, and the public was gradually reassured.</p>
<p>However, the whereabouts of Miyazaki Sadao remained unknown.</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate was still frantically holding meetings daily when, suddenly, Miyazaki Sadao was found in the river off Bazhugang in Jingjiang County!</p>
<p>What follows is an excerpt from Miyazaki's "confession" at the police station, which he also signed with his fingerprint at the end:</p>
<p>"At around nine o'clock on the afternoon of the 24th, I went alone to a brothel on Bazilu Road. At nine-thirty, after paying two dollars, I wanted to walk back, but three men, who seemed to be Chinese, chased after me, demanding more money. After arguing for a while, I took a rickshaw towards the Peace Pagoda. However, when I left the brothel, a Japanese sailor saw me arguing with these three men. Because I was wearing a military uniform and afraid of being recognized, I discarded my military cap and collar before getting into the rickshaw to go to the Peace Pagoda. After passing the Peace Pagoda, I wrapped my uniform in a newspaper and hid for two nights. On the morning of the 26th, I boarded an English ship to escape. On the ship, I slept on the deck. The crew said they would report to the captain. Because I was traveling without a ticket, I was filled with fear, so at one o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th, I jumped into the Yangtze River. At that time, the ship had already reached Jingjiang. On the 27th, I was rescued."</p>
<p>Jingjiang County sent him to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and on the afternoon of the 28th, he was handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs returned him to the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<p>However, upon receiving him, the Japanese military felt greatly humiliated. The protagonist of this farce was immediately arrested and accused of some crime of selling appropriated goods, and sent back to Japan, where he was imprisoned until recently.</p>
<p>Miyazaki Sadao spent ten years in prison, and the Japanese military seems to have thought that this covered up the shame.</p>
<p>This is the behavior of a "samurai" in a country that often boasts of "bushido"!</p>
<h3>Two Beloved Sons Missing, Lingering in Government Offices: Owner of Money Exchange Suffers Business Failure, Misfortune Comes in Pairs, Enduring Fear</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Yaotang, a 40-year-old man from Zhenjiang, opened the Xietai Money Exchange at 180 Nanjing Road and resided at 111 Zhaofeng Villa, Changning Road. He had a wife and a concubine, Ms. Gu and Ms. Wu, respectively, who got along well on weekdays. Ms. Gu gave birth to two sons, the elder named Lingdi, nine years old, and the younger named Maomao, only four years old. The family of several lived happily. Unexpectedly, Xietai Exchange suffered excessive losses recently and went bankrupt on the 9th. Rumors spread, and creditors flocked to Jiang's residence to demand payment of debts, carrying away redwood furniture as collateral. At that time, Jiang could only let them do as they pleased and voluntarily issued a written guarantee to clear the debt on time. After the creditors left, Yaotang also went out. Not long after, another group of creditors arrived, and amidst the commotion, unexpectedly, Jiang's two children, Lingdi and Maomao, disappeared at the same time. After Ms. Gu discovered this, she immediately reported to the Changning Road Branch Bureau, requesting an investigation. Police were dispatched to investigate, but no clues were found that night. By eleven o'clock yesterday morning, the two children were suddenly found in the French Park, reported by the gardener to the Lujiiawan Branch Bureau, who dispatched police to bring them back. The Changning Branch Bureau was notified and ordered the police to go and bring them back for investigation. According to the two children, two people took them into a car at that time and drove away quickly, detained them for a night, and then sent them to the French Park the next morning. This matter is quite suspicious, whether it was a prank by an enemy or there were other motives, it has not been clarified yet.</p>
<h3>Municipal Construction Donations Collected Last Month Only Exceeded 6 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Council decided to levy additional municipal construction donations during its first conference, it was handed over to the Municipal Government for implementation. The Finance Bureau started collecting the autumn municipal construction donations in November and is now nearing completion, with only over 6 billion yuan collected, a huge difference from the ideal amount. The main reason for this is that the Finance Bureau collected the donations according to the pre-war housing donation registers of the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, so there are only over 160,000 households in the city, which is less than half of the current number. It is reported that the bureau is now trying to improve so that such a phenomenon will not occur again during the winter collection.</p>
<h3>Fire Drill Postponed for the Second Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Fire Prevention Publicity Week, Fire Police Drill and Firefighting Performance, originally scheduled for November 30, was postponed due to rain and loose ground, which could not bear the weight of the fire trucks. It was originally scheduled to be held at 9:30 tomorrow morning in the Zhongzheng Park, but due to the wind and rain last night, it was decided to postpone it for the second time and will be held after the weather clears.</p>

<h3>Youth League Hosts the Last Batch of Demobilized Soldiers This Morning</h3>

Jiang Jingguo, Director of the Training Department of the Ministry of National Defense, is extremely concerned about this batch of demobilized youth soldiers and has specially sent Colonel Deng Kao to Shanghai to take care of them.

<h3>Investigation of the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Section Chief's Embezzlement of Public Funds Completed; Public Prosecution Filed: Wu Suiren's Crime of Corruption; Beijing Office States in Letter that Wu Seemed to Have Been Preparing for Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Wu Suiren, a clerk in the Disbursement Section of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), embezzling public education funds for lending at interest, has been investigated by Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi of the District Procuratorate, and a public prosecution has been filed for the crime of corruption.</p>
<p>According to the case, Wu Suiren used his position to embezzle 2.7 billion yuan of UNRRA's September funds for lending at interest. On October 28, when the department discovered the embezzlement, Wu immediately expressed remorse and returned the entire 2.7 billion yuan of public funds, along with the 14.6 million yuan in interest earned. Although UNRRA did not suffer any losses, the embezzlement of public funds violated the criminal code. Huo Doushu, the director of UNRRA, sent a letter to the District Procuratorate on November 16, requesting legal action. After accepting the case, the procuratorate issued an arrest warrant and detained Wu Suiren on the morning of the 27th. The prosecution has now been filed after investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Three Other Remittances Also Found Suspicious</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The UNRRA office in Beijing sent a letter to the UNRRA headquarters, stating that Wu Suiren seemed to have been preparing for fraud. On August 16, Wu sent a letter to the Beijing office requesting that the checks be changed to named payee checks for easy collection. Therefore, in addition to the 2.7 billion yuan embezzlement, there are also suspicions that (1) 1.8 billion yuan remitted from Beijing to Shanghai on September 13 to cover the August UNRRA funds, (2) 2 billion yuan remitted to Shanghai on October 3 to cover the August UNRRA funds, and (3) 500 million yuan remitted to Shanghai on October 24 to cover the additional allocation of the September UNRRA funds were delayed in order to obtain interest.</p>
<h3>One Folding Fan, Second Trial: Chen Mo Denies Concealment, Insists it was Purchased in Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Mo (also known as Chen Bingsi), who was accused by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of concealing a folding fan from the Qianlong era belonging to the traitor Liang Hongzhi, and is facing legal charges, had his case heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Chen's wife and witness Cai Depei were also summoned. After the hearing, the court adjourned and rescheduled the trial, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>First, Chen's wife was questioned. Chen's wife, wearing a black sea otter velvet coat, a red scarf, and yellow high-heeled leather shoes, stated that she and Chen Mo were married in 1937 and moved into 45 Yuyuanfang, Yuguo Road, last November. The sofas in the house were borrowed from Wan Molin, the mahogany tables and chairs were purchased from Cai Xingtai Furniture Store on Pushi Road, the four paintings by Wang Yiting were gifts from Qian Jingen, and the Qianlong-era folding fan was purchased from a calligraphy and painting stall outside the Wuhou Temple in the south gate of Chengdu around the tenth day of the first lunar month of 1944 for 6,000 yuan, with Cai Depei as a witness.</p>
<p>Request for Confrontation</p>
<p>Next, Chen Mo was questioned. Chen, wearing a coffee-colored camel hair robe and black leather shoes, nodded to his family when he entered the court. Standing in the defendant's dock, he showed an arrogant expression. He stated that he was originally the leader of the Vanguard Corps of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and resigned around September 10 last year. He is now doing import and export business. In August of last year, because the Vanguard Corps had no place to live, he moved into the residence of the traitor Li Tuqun through the introduction of Tang Shengming, and left the residence when the corps was ordered to go to Liuhe for assembly at the end of August. He did not go there to seal it up. This matter can be inquired of Li's wife, Ye Jiqing. He does not know where Liang Hongzhi's residence is. Chen's residence was the residence of the Military Statistics Bureau. He denied that the Qianlong-era folding fan belonged to Liang Hongzhi. He testified that the circumstances of his purchase of the folding fan were the same as those described by his wife. The court presented two letters of accusation from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization for the defendant to read. Chen argued that he did not know the accuser, Wu Yongqing, and it would be best to have him appear in court for a confrontation. At this point, the court ordered Chen Mo to sit aside and then summoned the witness, Cai Depei, to testify.</p>
<p>Merchant Testifies</p>
<p>Cai Depei testified that he used to study at West China University in Chengdu and is now doing business in Shanghai. He met the defendant in Hong Kong in 1939. Around the first month of 1944, he accompanied Chen Mo and Chen's wife to the Wuhou Temple, and witnessed him purchasing a folding fan from a calligraphy and painting stall, one side with landscape paintings and the other with calligraphy, bamboo bone, one foot long; slightly old.</p>
<p>At this point, the court announced that further investigation was needed and rescheduled the trial. A request for bail could be made in a separate application. The defendant was taken back into custody after meeting with his family.</p>
<h3>Black Hat Persistently Quibbles; Jiang Shiyan's Trial Concluded and Awaiting Sentence</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Shiyan, the "Black Hat," who was assigned as a deputy squad leader in the Central China Railway Company case, beat a female passenger, Xu Peiwen, in March 1945, causing her death due to serious injuries. The case caused a sensation in Shanghai at the time. As a result, Jiang Shiyan was sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet court. After the victory, the case was reinvestigated by the Prosecutor's Office of the Shanghai High Court, and a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. The High Court is currently hearing the case. The High Procuratorate has now filed an additional charge of treason against Jiang Shiyan, accusing him of holding a position in the puppet regime, abusing the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and killing travelers. The High Court heard the treason part of the case yesterday morning. The defendant, wearing a dark blue woolen cotton robe, gave extremely cunning testimony, only admitting to a verbal argument and denying that he beat Xu Peiwen to death. The court then presented the medical record from the Shanghai Sanatorium and the statements from the puppet police station and the local court to question him. The defendant prevaricated. After the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Yongqing, stood up to defend him, the court scheduled the sentencing for the 18th, and the defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Police Chief's Embezzlement Case: Sentenced to Three and a Half Years, Not Convinced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Nas, a Hungarian national and chief of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department, embezzled 245,000 yuan of the department's fines between April and October of this year. The matter was discovered by the department and immediately referred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in court yesterday, and the defendant pleaded guilty to embezzling public funds, but claimed to have been engaged in anti-Japanese work for many years and hoped to be leniently sentenced. The judge stood up and announced the verdict in court, granting Nas a reduced sentence due to his honest confession, sentencing him to three years and six months in prison, and depriving him of his civil rights for three years. The embezzled funds were to be recovered. The defendant expressed disagreement with the verdict and claimed he would appeal to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Youth Arrested for Extortion by Impersonation, Rui Weiyin Transferred to the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A man named Du Zhenhuai, from Taizhou, Northern Jiangsu, runs a Guanmei Soy Sauce shop at 245 Yangjiadu Garbage Pond, Pudong. On November 6th of this year, a young man came to reside there, claiming to be Rui Weiyin, the deputy chairman of the Three People's Principles Youth League and a reporter for the News Agency (which was ordered to stop publishing in September). He accused Du of coming from Northern Jiangsu and being suspected of being a Communist, and extorted 5 million yuan from him. Du refused. The next day, the young man, accompanied by two military policemen, went to threaten him again. Du dealt with them evasively while reporting the information to the Yangjiadu Police Branch Bureau, which dispatched police to bring the three back for questioning. The two military policemen were immediately transferred to the Military Police Headquarters for handling, while Rui Weiyin was transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Okinawa's Inventory is Small and Old, Supply Bureau Stops Selling Jeeps</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, went to Okinawa Island last week to inspect surplus US materials. It is reported that during this inspection, Director Jiang discovered that some materials, especially jeeps, were scarce and badly damaged, with missing parts that could not be repaired. Therefore, it is planned to return them to the US military authorities and not count them in the purchase. As a result, the bureau will stop selling jeeps. Currently, there are very few jeeps in Shanghai under repair, and they have already been pre-assigned, so the purchase orders of other applicants will be canceled.</p>
<p>In addition, the bureau currently has about 400 employees working at the surplus materials storage and processing center on Okinawa Island. All their supplies on the island need to be transported from here. As the number of hours is large, the bureau has prepared a large number of winter clothes, which will soon be sent to the island by personnel.</p>
<h3>Silt Accumulation in the Suzhou River Estuary Section Under Dredging</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Port Authority recently received reports from most inland river shipping merchants that the riverbed at the entrance of the Suzhou River estuary to the Huangpu River is rising day by day due to tidal rise and fall and silt accumulation, causing ships with heavier drafts to run aground. Therefore, dredging ships have been dispatched to dredge the section first, and it is estimated that the silt will be removed in the shortest time.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Store Robbed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Rongkang Woolen Fabric Store at 278 Guangdong Road was robbed yesterday morning around six o'clock. When a female employee opened the back door to wash the toilet, she discovered that a large number of woolen fabrics on the second floor warehouse were in disarray. After careful inspection, she found that the north-facing window was open. She shouted loudly and the shop assistants and apprentices got up to check. A piece of Sino-Textile Hailis woolen fabric and two pieces of Bee Brand camel hair woolen fabric, worth a total of 2.57 million yuan, were found to be missing. Afterwards, the person in charge, Ren Xiang, reported the theft to the police and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>The Desolate Hardware and Secondhand Goods Industry: Unbearable to Recall Mantingfang; The Prosperous Period Has Become a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Jin Yuli" (Golden Jade Lane), "Mantingfang" (Full Courtyard Lane), these names are beautiful enough—almost sarcastically. Entering through an archway-style gate, one finds a dirty, dark alley. Following the damp cobblestone road, turning west, and passing through a dimly lit teahouse, "Jin Yuli" ends, followed by "Mantingfang." It's not a full courtyard of fragrant flowers, but rather some dim, rusty yellow brass and white iron. Although this place is called a "fang" (lane), it's actually a narrow street, reaching Shilu in the west and Xishangling Street in the east. In this short street, doors are set up as shops, displaying many stalls selling scrap copper and old iron. These stalls are similar to the loads carried by small coppersmiths, but larger in area. From east to west, there are more than twenty of them. Some people, because they have no business, may rest for a day or two.</p>
<p>Stall History Exceeds Forty Years</p>
<p>The place has historical origins. According to the stall vendors, stalls have been set up here as far back as forty years ago. Initially, they sold incense candles and hardware. Slowly, the incense candle business declined, while the hardware business became increasingly prosperous, growing from small to large, from insignificant to significant. Some vendors became shop owners; some small stalls expanded into large stalls; some helpers became independent operators; some flew far away and became wealthy giants in the hardware industry. In short, the people here have passed down their trade from father to son, from teacher to disciple. After forty years of ups and downs, the name "Mantingfang" has become established. The stall vendor extended his hand from his sleeve and pointed to a hardware store across the street, saying, "That store used to be a stall, but later it became a store." I looked at the store. The storefront was small and the items were cluttered, but compared to the stalls, it was outstanding. The store owner might feel proud. After so many years of effort, he has finally acquired this family business, although this business, as it looks now, is still inevitably suffering from depression and decline.</p>
<p>Fragmentary and Numerous Varieties</p>
<p>The goods here are mostly fragmentary, such as huge steel pliers, small copper locks, hammers, drills, iron rods, files, etc... There are also machine parts and vehicle materials, etc. Because they are messy and cluttered, it is most suitable for stall vendors to sell them. People with vision may want to rummage through them. A discarded machine may be able to find a cheap part here and be reused; a broken car may be able to find what it needs here and drive again. However, these are all things of the past. Now, this place has become very desolate. The stall vendor said to me, "You've been here for half a day, have you seen a single stall make a sale?" Indeed, not only has there been no business, but there has not even been anyone asking. Even if someone buys a small part, it is just a drop in the bucket for them. Their hope is to clear out all their goods together and change to another industry. They are not satisfied with selling one or two items occasionally. Perhaps they are happier when reporters come to talk to them, allowing them to complain about their hardships!</p>
<p>Victory Arrives, Inventory Devalues</p>
<p>Starting in 1944, during the period when the enemy was scavenging scrap iron, seemed to be their prosperous period. Their goods were not subject to scavenging, and things were scarce and expensive. They really made a small fortune at that time, but after the victory, the puppet currency was converted at a rate of two hundred to one, and the inventory devalued, so the business immediately declined!</p>
<h3>More Foreign Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai; The Port Affairs Committee Decides to Prepare Properly to Cope with Congestion at Docks and Warehouses</h3>

<p>(1) Peeling Hands</p>
<p>Asked by Xu Wenkui</p>
<p>I suffer from a skin disease on my hands. The palms are red and peeling, and one joint of my fingers cannot be straightened. The skin that is not peeling is firm, thick, rough, and dry. I don't know if it is tinea manus. How should it be treated?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your condition may be tinea manus, but there are many types of skin diseases. It is advisable to consult a doctor for a diagnosis and medication.</p>
<p>(2) Many Diseases in Postpartum Women</p>
<p>Wei Jifu asked: Two months after childbirth, the woman suddenly suffered from swollen feet. A hard, movable lump appeared on the side of her neck and has been growing larger. Local doctors say it is a scrofulous neck and have repeatedly treated it without success. Recently, another lump has appeared elsewhere. Please advise: (1) What is this disease? What is the cause? (2) The woman has not had her period for nine months. Is this related to the disease? (3) What kind of doctor should be consulted for this condition? (4) The woman has suffered from this disease for a long time and is weak and emaciated. Can she take tonics? What is suitable? (5) The child is nine months old, and the fontanelle on the top of his head is not yet closed. Is this a sign of congenital deficiency? Is it beneficial to take calcium supplements, Helevita drops, and milk powder? (6) Will the hard lump on the woman's neck harm the child's health if he drinks her milk?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Zhang Zhongming] (1) This hard object is a swollen lymph node, and there are many causes, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and inflammation. (2) Women may temporarily stop menstruating while breastfeeding. (3) All public hospitals in Shanghai can treat this, and the fees are relatively low. (4) If the woman is weak and emaciated, she can take cod liver oil and other tonics. (5) The anterior fontanelle of children usually closes at the age of one year. Your son is only nine months old, and the anterior fontanelle has not yet closed, so it cannot be said to be a congenital deficiency. Calcium supplements, vitamin supplements, and milk powder are all good to take together, but avoid excessive amounts. (6) If the hard lump on the woman is infectious, it can infect the child.</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Eliminating the Black Market for Cotton Yarn; Specific Plan Principles Have Been Determined; Government Provides Foreign Exchange but Must Exchange Yarn for Cotton; Cotton Textile Association to Discuss Implementation Plan Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to thoroughly eliminate the black market for cotton yarn, Premier Song convened another meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM with Wu, the concurrent Chairman of the Textile Management Committee, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Rong Yixin, and others to discuss specific plans. It is heard that the general principles have been largely determined, and the main points are recorded as follows: (1) Raw materials: (A) Establish a review committee for the allocation of raw cotton, with Li Yu, Director of the Allocation Department of the Executive Committee of the Women's Management Committee, and one representative from national and private yarn factories each serving as members. (B) Within the permitted import quota of raw cotton, each yarn factory is allowed to allocate it themselves. (2) Finished products: In principle, it is stipulated that yarn be exchanged for cotton. In other words, the government provides foreign exchange for purchasing cotton and, at the same time, recovers a portion of the cotton yarn at a negotiated price. If there is a surplus, it will still be for the free trade of each yarn factory. (3) Unify the business operations of national and private yarn factories. In addition to the Textile Construction Company, which has already resumed the listing system, the opening of yarn by private factories should be centralized at the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association. The association will still organize a distribution committee to list and open yarn for sale. (4) Before each opening of yarn, the standard price of each type of yarn should be negotiated based on its quality and type, under the principle of being lower than the market price. Price negotiations should adopt a flexible method, which can be adjusted according to market needs and the factory's own yarn inventory.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, in accordance with the instructions of Premier Song, convened a meeting of the standing directors yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Liu Jingji, Guo Qiong, and others attended. The principles decided at the meeting convened by Premier Song were made into a plan to be submitted to the regular meeting of the Textile Management Committee, which will be held at 3:00 PM on the 12th, for discussion. At the same time, the detailed implementation rules were also studied.</p>
<p>According to a person concerned who spoke to a reporter: The government's opening of foreign exchange settlement for American cotton imports will be handled on a quarterly basis (i.e., three months). Based on the current production volume of cotton yarn in China, the permitted import quota for each quarter is estimated to be approximately 200,000 to 300,000 bales. At that time, in order to promote domestic cotton, the government will allocate a certain proportion of domestic cotton based on the number of American cotton purchase applications. Furthermore, according to observations: If the yarn-for-cotton system is implemented, the government will be able to provide the textile industry with a large amount of raw cotton and, therefore, also be able to easily obtain a large amount of cotton yarn. Although there will still be a surplus for each factory to trade freely, it will be relatively small. Therefore, it is expected that the future trend of yarn prices will undoubtedly be stable. At the same time, from now on, national and private yarn factories will take the same steps in opening yarn for sale, and price negotiations will adopt a flexible method. Therefore, it is expected that the black market for cotton yarn can be eradicated as a result.</p>

Currently, due to power restrictions, production has been greatly reduced. According to a major player in the industry, production is limited on the one hand by electricity, so that all factories cannot operate at full capacity, and on the other hand by raw materials. The wheat required for flour production is insufficient in China and relies heavily on imports. Countries have restricted exports, so the source has become more problematic. If there are no more imports of foreign wheat, then some factories may stop operating next year. In addition, the manufacturing cost of the industry is very high, and the price limit is low, so it is difficult for factories to maintain operations.</p>

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Requests Loans; Total Amount is 66 Billion Yuan; Each Loom Mortgages 12 Billion Yuan; Is Presenting a Petition to the Government Authorities for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The electric silk weaving industry in this city is in a difficult situation and has submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Banks Joint Treasury, requesting the government to provide assistance in terms of loans and orders. On the lending measures, the industry's specific requirements are:</p>
<p>I. Relax the number of loans and mortgage measures as follows:</p>
<p>A. The total amount of the loan is 66 billion yuan, and each loom is lent 12 million yuan. (The total number of looms is estimated to be 5,500)</p>
<p>B. Each loom and equipment mortgages 6 million yuan, semi-finished products on the machine mortgage 4 million yuan, and finished products on the machine mortgage 2 million yuan, totaling the above number. (If there are no semi-finished products or the number of finished products on the machine is insufficient, it will be calculated based on the actual amount)</p>
<p>C. Use of loans</p>
<p>(1) To repay old debts and high-interest loans</p>
<p>(2) To purchase raw materials</p>
<p>(3) To pay wages and other payments</p>
<p>Other than the above three items, it must not be used for other purposes</p>
<p>D. The interest rate is in accordance with the silk cocoon loan precedent, with a monthly interest rate of 2.2%.</p>
<p>II. Accepting orders from state-owned agencies will follow the same industry practice of releasing materials for weaving on behalf of the state-owned agencies. The state-owned agencies will issue raw materials to customize silk loans that meet export standards, and the detailed measures will be specified in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>In terms of ordering, the industry association recommends that the factory silk stored in the China Trust Bureau be processed by the industry's factories and transported to Nanyang, the United States, and Canada to develop overseas markets. The presentation also pointed out: The price of rayon distributed by the China Trust Bureau is 2.8 million yuan per box, while the price of the government's barter trade with Japan is only 500,000 yuan per box according to the Hong Kong market price, and the profit is more than 2 million yuan per box. As of now, the manufacturers have purchased 5,400 boxes from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and 4,300 boxes from the China Trust Bureau, for a total profit of 20 billion yuan for the government. Therefore, if the National Bureau of Travel can release a number at this time, it is really "taking from the same industry and using it in the same industry." Shareholders also expressed: If it is not approved, then the factory has no other way but to close down, and only the entire factory assets, machinery and more than 20,000 workers and staff will be transferred to the state for proper placement.</p>

However, beyond 420 yuan for forward Yong Sha, it couldn't sustain. No. 173, No. 215, No. 152, and No. 16 quickly competed to sell, dropping to around 405 yuan.

After No. 89 arbitrarily suppressed the price, spot Yong Sha immediately saw a low price of 390 yuan. No. 160, No. 215, No. 16, No. 229, No. 102, and No. 180 took advantage of the low price to buy in, causing a slight rebound. However, No. 89, No. 142, and No. 31 continued to sell, liquidating floating profits, pushing the price down again near noon. No. 180 bought in on dips, and No. 38, No. 151, and No. 44 came in to buy, stabilizing slightly before closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha and Xin He fell by half a percentage point, Mei Bing fell by a little less than one percentage point, and Jing Fu, Xin Guang, Qin Xing, and Hua Feng suffered limited losses.

No. 232, No. 233, No. 213, No. 224, No. 199, and No. 145 successively bought, and the buying sentiment was overwhelming. Outside the market, Cantonese traders bought enthusiastically, and "cross-trading" houses rushed to cover their positions in the market. Thus, news such as the abolition of price limits on yarn and cloth, the success of Sino-American loans, and changes in foreign exchange rates abounded. The buying frenzy became even more intense near the close, soaring by more than thirty yuan and ending at a high price. After the close, there were still calls for higher prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, and Jing Fu rose by half a percentage point, Mei Ya was flat, Hua Feng and Xin Guang rose by a little less than one percentage point, Qin Xing rebounded by one percentage point, and the unpopular stock, Matches, rose to the limit.

<h3>National Assembly Education Representatives Hu Shi and Others Submit Recommendations, Requesting the Government to Pay Attention to Education Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] National Assembly representatives from the liberal professions and the education sector, including Hu Shi, Cao Ju, Ye Suzhong, Ge Wei, Yang Zhan, Huang Zhaoxiong, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jianbai, Zhou Houchu, Wang Ziyu, Wang Yizhou, Xu Tonghe, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Xifang, Liang Xianda, Zhang Yi, and Ruan Zhidao, a total of eighteen people, have made suggestions to the National Assembly, requesting the government to pay attention to major issues currently related to education. The original suggestions are recorded as follows: Education is the foundation of a nation and the basis for implementing democratic politics. As the Constitution is being formulated and the government is about to return power to the people, it is especially important to promote education widely, so that the people have the ability to implement the Constitution and exercise political power. In addition to having inclusive and adaptable provisions for education in the Constitution, so that the basic policies of the country can be promoted without hindrance, we must express our views on important matters in education, so that the government can adopt them in educational facilities, and we hope that those in society who care about education will show sympathy, unanimously advocate, and promote their realization.</p>
<p>Use Specialists and Improve Efficiency</p>
<p>First, the government should employ specialists to handle education: In modern times, education has become a specialized discipline, and educational undertakings are particularly professional in general society. Therefore, those who handle education must have specialized knowledge and experience. Currently, those engaged in educational administration and teaching lack knowledge and experience. Most people still think that educational administration and educational undertakings can be done by everyone, and that anyone can be a teacher. Therefore, various elements enter together, and no achievements are made, and education is not valued. These errors must be corrected immediately. The government must carefully appoint educational administrators at all levels, and the education authorities must pay attention to employing specialists related to the education they handle. Primary and secondary school teachers should be filled by those who have received teacher training, so that educational efficiency can be improved, and the mission of education can be gradually accomplished.</p>
<p>Allocate Enemy and Puppet Industry to Fund Expenses</p>
<p>Second, the government should allocate large sums of money to actively handle education: During the War of Resistance, education and culture were most severely damaged. Since the victory, the restoration of education and culture has been most slow. The society has failed to provide widespread assistance, and the government has failed to do its best. In the entire economic system, some people often only see the consumption of education and forget the contribution of education to the future of the country, resulting in the inability of most destroyed schools to be restored, the inability of schools to be added, and countless children and youth wandering the streets with no schools to attend. The situation is extremely serious. The central government should take a long-term view and regard the restoration of education and the addition of schools as its unshirkable responsibility. It should immediately allocate large sums of money to subsidize the restoration of public and private schools at all levels and to add new schools to accommodate out-of-school children and youth and to reverse the current decline. Furthermore, the property of enemies, puppets, and traitors in various places should be allocated to educational expenses, because the property of enemies and puppets mostly comes from the exploitation of the people, and using it for education best meets the wishes of the people.</p>
<p>Restore County Education Bureaus Early</p>
<p>Third, the government should restore county education bureaus early and provide large subsidies for local education: Local education below the county level has been disrupted due to the destruction by enemies and puppets and the impact of financial centralization. The promotion of universal education has also been delayed, and the independent spirit of the original educational funding has been completely destroyed. It has also been diverted for other purposes in large quantities. For example, the original local educational funding was 40% or 50% or more before the war, but now it has dropped to about 10%. The original educational funding was already not abundant. Looking at the current situation of local education, school equipment is simple and insufficient for teaching, teachers' salaries are low, with monthly incomes of 40,000 or 50,000 yuan, which cannot even maintain their personal lives. Excellent teachers have changed careers, and unqualified personnel account for more than 300,000 of the 600,000 teachers, and even primary school graduates are employed as primary school teachers, with more than 80,000 people. The serious situation is self-evident. In the future, on the one hand, provinces should be ordered to restore county education bureaus from the 36th year, and on the other hand, the system of guaranteeing local educational funding should be restored, and it must be used for specific purposes only. On one hand, the central government should increase subsidies for local national education funding, and it should bear at least one-quarter of the cost in order to achieve universal education as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reward Private Schools and Subsidize Them</p>
<p>Fourth, the government should vigorously support and subsidize private education undertakings: Currently, the number of schools run by private individuals in China accounts for more than one-third of public schools, which shows that private education has greatly benefited the national education undertaking. Since the victory, the government has turned a deaf ear to private education undertakings. Some excellent private schools have been unable to rebuild, and the government has not provided substantial assistance. This is a major defect in education. Private school teachers and staff are also national public educators, but they have not enjoyed the same treatment as the nation. We sincerely hope that the government will attach equal importance to education undertakings, regardless of public or private, reward and subsidize private schools, and give private school teachers the same treatment. As for private schools that were destroyed in the War of Resistance and still want to restore the school, we sincerely hope that the government will provide substantial assistance.</p>
<p>Quickly Increase Teacher Salaries</p>
<p>Fifth, the government should increase teachers' salaries: Educational personnel, whether engaged in national education or other levels of education, hold the hub of the nation's new life. Recently, due to high prices and difficult living conditions, teachers at all levels have felt pain, especially primary school teachers. If teachers cannot have enough to eat, how can educational efficiency be achieved? Currently, the phenomenon of teachers at all levels changing careers and retreating has become widespread. If we do not actively reverse this, it can cause extremely serious consequences. We hope that the government will have the greatest determination, make the greatest decision, and quickly increase teachers' salaries, so that they can meet the needs of actual local life, and increase them as the cost of living increases, so that they can feel at ease and specialize.</p>
<p>Strictly Order the Return of Occupied School Buildings</p>
<p>Sixth, the government should strictly supervise and order the return of school buildings that have been occupied: At the beginning of the victory, the order was not stable, and many troops and administrative agencies occupied school buildings and the houses of national cultural institutions. When order was restored, education should be restored at the same time, but the occupied school buildings often do not return for a long time, so that ten schools cannot be restored soon. Although the government has issued orders, they have not been thoroughly implemented. We hope that the government will strictly order its subordinates to seriously handle this matter and return them immediately, so as not to cause resentment in the education community.</p>

(Article 9) After a private school is converted into a substitute national school, if the original board of directors of the private primary school is unwilling to continue operating and is willing to donate all of the school's property to the public, its substitute nature may be revoked and it may be converted into a national school. (Article 10) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

Once the official document from the Executive Yuan arrives at the Administrative Headquarters, the funds will be allocated.</p>

<h3>The First Pudong Cross-Country Race: Over 10,000 Meters, Route Announced Yesterday, Registration Very Enthusiastic</h3>

<h3>University Ball Game Referee Issues</h3>
<p>A Good Teacher Should Be a Good Referee</p>
<p>This Saturday, the University Football League will resume, and Fudan and Soochow will compete again. The venue and referee have both been changed. Although it was not the players and referees who participated in the brawls during the first game, it cannot be denied that the referee's unfamiliarity with the techniques was the source of the dispute. Chen Ling had stated at the first meeting of university sports directors that after ten years in the interior, he was no longer familiar with football refereeing and was prone to mistakes. However, the other directors present at the meeting believed that it was an insult for a university sports director not to be able to serve as a referee. Shen Kunnan, the Fudan sports director, also believed that a good sports instructor is not necessarily a good referee, and vice versa, a good referee is not necessarily a good sports teacher. Therefore, serious consideration should be given to the referee's qualifications before a game. When a reporter met with Fudan President Zhang Yi the day before yesterday, President Zhang also believed that the university ball game should invite people from the referee association to referee. However, we hope that the sports directors who teach at the university will also pay attention to refereeing in addition to teaching sports. Of course, "a good teacher is not necessarily a good referee," but "a good teacher should be a good referee." As university sports are currently unfolding, we should have no objections.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Basketball Level Is Low: Qingbai Team Can Win All</h3>
<p>Basketball Committee Chairman Qian Xucang Returns to Shanghai and Talks</p>
<p>Qian Xucang, chairman of the Shanghai Sports Association Basketball Committee, flew to Hong Kong on the same plane with the Qingbai Expedition Basketball Team on the 2nd of this month. It has been ten days since then. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Qian returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou by China Airlines plane. Due to weather conditions, it did not land at Longhua Airport until 5:05 PM. He immediately drove back to his residence. According to his conversation with reporters: Among the ball sports in Hong Kong Island, football is more active than any other sport, and the level is the highest in the country. However, the level of basketball is lower than that of Shanghai. Therefore, the Qingbai Basketball Team has won three consecutive victories as of yesterday. Based on the situation, it is expected that they will be able to return in triumph with a complete victory. The Qingbai Football Team, when he left Hong Kong, in addition to being defeated by Xingdong in the first game, there was still a game in the afternoon yesterday. It is expected that all games will be completed around the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Industry Moves Forward Against the Headwinds of Recession</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Ding Weidong</p>
<p>Three Pillars: Cotton Mills, Flour Mills, Silk Mills</p>
<p>The degree of industrialization in Wuxi is second only to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. The amount of electricity used by industry is enough to prove this fact. The Qi Yao power plant sends 8,000 horsepower of power to Wuxi industry every day. The amount cannot be considered low, but the power shortage is still a problem. Large industries have enough power with difficulty, and many small industries that arose during the war have to install their own power generation equipment at a considerable cost. According to the power plant engineers, to meet the full needs of Wuxi industry, I am afraid that another 8,000 horsepower of power will have to be added every day! And this is only the current situation. With the current high profits of cotton mills and the diligence and pragmatism of Wuxi people, there are quite a few people who are planning to expand. Those who have ordered spindles overseas will continue to come in the next year or two. As such, the production capacity will expand, and the need for electricity will be even more urgent. If we take this as a measure, we can see that the future of Wuxi's industrialization is truly limitless!</p>
<p>The three pillars of Wuxi industry are: cotton mills, flour mills, and silk mills. Due to objective environmental reasons, the prosperity and decline of these three types of industries today are vastly different. During my short journey, I had contact with people from all three industries and gained a general understanding of the difficulties and prospects of each industry. Now I will try to make a comprehensive report in the order of cotton, flour, and silk industries.</p>
<h3>Lucky Cotton Industry: No One Can Fail to Make Huge Profits as Long as They Manage Well</h3>
<p>The cotton spinning industry is undoubtedly the darling of heaven among the difficult Chinese industries today. The demand is high and production is insufficient, the black market price is high and the raw materials are relatively cheap, and regardless of whether it is a large or small factory, as long as it is well managed, there is no one that does not make a lot of money. The price of cotton yarn in Wuxi is not limited, and the selling price is about 2.3 million yuan per bale, and the prosperity of the yarn weaving industry can be imagined. As for the cotton mills in the city, the larger in scale and more in output, there are Shenxin No. 3 Factory and other companies. Please refer to the attached table below:</p>
<p>The equipment in other smaller cotton mills with one or two thousand spindles is still more than ten. The above table lists the highest number of equipment in each factory. In fact, many were destroyed during the war, and some are still in the process of being repaired. Not so many are in operation today. How many spindles are spinning in Wuxi today? There are two estimates: one is about 100,000 spindles, and the other is about 110,000 spindles. This means that the current production of yarn is only about 60% of that before the war. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, when the enemy occupied Wuxi, they deeply hated the Chinese textile industry, which hindered the national policy of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." The 70,000 spindles of Shenxin No. 3 Factory were systematically destroyed, leaving only 10,000 spindles! As for the 1,478 looms, they were all destroyed and nothing remained. Shenxin's fate was like this, and the fate of other major factories was similar. However, one year after the victory of the War of Resistance, although the country is in turmoil and the social economy is turbulent, I have been able to witness that Shenxin has been able to recover to 50,000 spindles, and the weaving factory has begun to be equipped in the burnt factory building, and there may be 500 looms running in December. Workers and staff are working with the same enthusiasm under the brilliant electric light; other factories also have the prospect and expectation of tomorrow. The past experience seems to be just a nightmare, and everything disappeared with the victory. I deeply feel that the Chinese people's endurance and vitality are the strongest reliance to overcome all difficulties. The raw materials for the cotton mills in Wuxi are mainly American cotton, and sometimes Brazilian cotton is used. Before the war, they were able to produce fine yarn of 40 counts and 60 counts, but now the machines are damaged and they can only spin coarse yarn of 20 counts and 30 counts. The treatment of workers is also better than that of other industries, generally from 80,000 to 320,000, and the treatment of skilled workers can also reach 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Their wages are calculated according to the cost of living. A friend in the factory told me! It is probably 80% of the wages in Shanghai. There are far fewer labor disputes in Wuxi than in Shanghai. There are two reasons: most of the main technicians in the major cotton mills have served for many years, shared hardships together, and have been together for a long time, gradually developing feelings. Even if they have any requests, they will come out of goodwill and negotiation, and rarely appear in the form of strikes. Second, Wuxi is not comparable to Shanghai. The local situation is simpler, and there is no large-scale organization and manipulation attempt for workers, so the situation is more stable. Recently, workers in Wuxi, in view of the high cost of living, requested to increase the basic salary by half. The capitalists will take a negative attitude on this matter, so it is difficult to predict whether the labor-capital relationship will be like before in the future. As for the efficiency of technicians, a factory owner said that it is only 70% or 80% of that before the war. It is not physical weakness, but a change in mentality, feeling that technicians are welcomed everywhere, "If this place doesn't keep me, there will be a place to keep me," so discipline is gone, and the teaching can be reduced. I usually feel deeply that in the current industrial situation in our country, in addition to the abnormally prosperous cotton spinning industry, the burden of wages will suffocate the national industry; but it is impossible to reduce wages today, so the only remedy is how to improve workers' sense of responsibility and enable them to spontaneously improve work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry Is Gloomy</h3>
<p>Compared with the cotton yarn industry, the flour mills and silk mills appear dim, and the latter is in a crisis of raw material shortage. Flour was originally the main industry in Wuxi before the war. The famous Rong family started with flour, and a piece of stone mill used when they started their business is still displayed as a family heirloom. During the nine years of the War of Resistance, due to the enemy and puppet control of food, Wuxi experienced a deformed prosperity. At that time, there were not a few people who raised funds to open flour mills. Today, the flour mills with a certain scale in the area are Maoxin, Guangfeng, and Zhenhua, among others, and there are more than ten others with smaller scales. The current recession is mainly due to three reasons: (1) Insufficient power supply makes it impossible to fully develop productivity, but expenses cannot be saved. According to an estimate by a gentleman in this industry: the current daily output of flour in Wuxi is only about 10,000 bags, but if there is enough electricity, it can be increased to 25,000 bags. This is quite reliable. In Maoxin No. 2 Factory, 8,000 bags of flour could be produced every day before the war, but now the output has been sharply reduced due to lack of electricity. 5,000 bags are produced on the first day, and 2,500 bags are produced on the second day, and the cycle repeats. The situation in other factories is similar. (2) The supply of raw materials mostly came from northern Jiangsu in the past, but due to the occupation of the area by the Communist army, the supply is not smooth, which affects production. (3) The current general recession in the grain industry is not an exception for the flour industry; the result is that the price of raw materials rises, while the selling price of flour does not rise, and there is no profit to be made. Under the above three unfavorable conditions, the current production of the flour industry is only 30% to 40% of that before the war. At the same time, the burden of taxation also makes the industry shrink. Now each bag of flour has to be taxed 400 yuan for goods tax, and there is also income tax and profit tax at the end of the year. A flour mill director told the reporter that the monthly tax expenditure is much larger than the salaries and food expenses of the employees. Under the current situation of poor sales, small factories are deeply troubled by high-interest loans, and one or two may announce liquidation at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Crisis Is More Serious Than Flour Mills</h3>
<p>The crisis of the silk industry in Wuxi is even more serious than that of the flour mills. There were 40 silk mills in the area before the war, and more than 20 small factories were established during the nine years of the War of Resistance, with a total of more than 60 factories employing more than 20,000 workers. Those with more equipment are shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Factory Name Number of Machines</p>
<p>Bada 156</p>
<p>China Silk No. 6 Factory 304</p>
<p>Zhengmao 104</p>
<p>Yongchang 114</p>
<p>Jincheng 272</p>
<p>Meixin 296</p>
<p>Yongtai 312</p>
<p>Dingxin 256</p>
<p>Jiangnan First Filature Factory 360</p>
<p>All these silk mills, regardless of size, are currently in a raw material panic. If the import of spring cocoons from Vietnam cannot become a reality, all of them will stop work before the end of this month. When autumn silk is on the market next year, cost will become the most serious problem. At present, the government's purchase price is 3.8 million yuan per dan (standard silk), but the cost of autumn silk is estimated to be more than 6 million yuan per dan; they are generally grateful for the government's intention to support the silk industry; they hope that the future purchase price can be adjusted again according to the actual cost. As for the export of raw silk, they have a common view: our silk production has two major weaknesses: the variety is not as good as others, so the quality of silk is also poor; second, the wages are too high, so the production cost of silk is also high; in the short term, we are still difficult to compete with the strong enemy Japan.</p>
<h3>A Productive City [Many Producers, Few Consumers]</h3>
<p>The current situation and prospects of the three main industries in Wuxi have been briefly described above. Compared with other places, it makes people feel hopeful. This is true of industry, and so is commerce. Of course, Wuxi's commerce is also in a recession, and closures are also happening. On the day the reporter arrived in Wuxi, a large pharmacy was forced to close by high-interest loans, and a rice shop with a history of more than ten years was struggling with a debt of 700 million yuan. The situation is terrible enough. However, the wealthy people in Wuxi use their money to run businesses instead of lending at high interest rates for enjoyment, which has a very good impact after all. Because once a business is established, it employs a lot of people, and other industries also increase prosperity due to the so-called "multiplier effect" in economics. Therefore, the unemployment situation in Wuxi is better than in other places. At the same time, because it is a productive place, the people's purchasing power is stronger, so even in the headwinds of commercial recession, the market situation is still good. As for the lives of farmers in Wuxi, they are not as good as before. In the past, they had two incomes every year, one from rice and one from sericulture, and their lives were not bad. Since the year one cut down mulberry trees and planted rice, who knows that the rise in rice prices cannot be proportional to other prices! A farmer's hard work for a year cannot even afford one or two clothes. The major economic contradiction in our country now is: if the price of rice is raised, the price of labor will inevitably rise. Factories will not be able to maintain; conversely, if the price of rice is not raised, the lives of 80% of the farmers will inevitably decline day by day, their purchasing power will be weak, and commerce will not prosper. I asked this question to a friend from a Wuxi cotton mill. His opinion is: "In the past, the government worked hard to stabilize prices, but neglected labor prices; in the future, we should work hard to reduce labor prices in order to solve the problem."</p>
<p>Wuxi is a productive city, and there are very few idlers, "many producers, few consumers," so it can not only support itself, but also export surplus materials. The reason why it can do this is because the natural environment is one reason, but the main reason is the human effort. The people's thrift, pragmatism, and focus on utilizing resources have finally made Wuxi a "Little Shanghai" - a productive city with the advantages of Shanghai but without the disadvantages of Shanghai. If one-third of the cities in China can concentrate the wisdom and talent of the people and develop in productive undertakings like the people of Wuxi, the reporter believes that the goal of improving people's lives will be achieved earlier.</p>
<h3>Enterprising Spirit: Repairing the Wounds of War and Striving to Expand Business</h3>
<p>The industrial circles in Wuxi have a very strong enterprising spirit. Their greatest advantage is that they live frugally, do not engage in extravagance, and use all their energy to develop their businesses. At present, most factories have development plans, not only to repair the wounds of war, but also to strive to expand their professions. In terms of the cotton industry, both large and small factories are placing orders overseas. For example, Shenxin Cotton Mill had 70,000 spindles before the war, and suffered heavy losses during the war. Now it has only recovered to 50,000 spindles, but they are now planning to increase to 126,000 spindles! On the eve of the end of the war, they ordered from American manufacturers, and it is expected that a part of them can be shipped in the spring. The other yarn factories ordered later, and there are only three factories in the United States that can manufacture spinning machines, and their own needs are also large; therefore, within a year, the production of yarn factories in Wuxi will not be greatly improved. In terms of flour mills, a temporary recession is not enough to discourage progressive industrialists, on the contrary, they have also set far-reaching development plans. For example, Maoxin No. 2 Factory is planning to purchase machines and establish a large factory in Wuxi with a daily output of 10,000 bags of flour; at the same time, Maoxin No. 1 Factory is also adding new British-made flour milling machines used during the war, and the output performance is particularly good. All of this shows their enterprising spirit.</p>
<h3>Power Issues</h3>
<p>Insufficient power has limited industrial production in the Wuxi area, but this problem is being successfully resolved. The reasons for the power shortage in Wuxi are varied. Firstly, many small industries have sprung up in the past decade, and they all require electricity. Secondly, before the war, major factories all had their own generators. However, during these turbulent years, some generators were lost, while others were left unused. This additional electricity burden has affected the overall supply and demand balance. As for the power supply from the Qishuyan Power Plant, it has not been reduced at all because the wartime machinery was undamaged. The Shenxin Textile Factory's generators are currently being borrowed by the power company to supply electricity to Wuxi. However, this is still not enough. Many small factories cannot get electricity and have to generate their own. Large factories also have limited electricity consumption. If they exceed the limit, they must supply coal to the Qishuyan Power Plant as compensation. Now, with the efforts of all parties, major textile factories will be able to resume their own power generation by next spring, and the Qishuyan Power Plant will also receive supplies from the Executive Yuan's generators and British wartime generators. The power supply capacity will also be increased. Therefore, the problem of insufficient power in Wuxi can be completely resolved in two or three months. In the past and present electricity distribution and dispatch, the Qishuyan Power Plant has indeed worked hard and diligently.</p>

<h3>The First Key Artery of the Lifeline: Snapshots of Changchun</h3>
<p>— November 28th Airmail Report by Our Changchun Reporter Fang Ren</p>
<p>Changchun is currently a patient suffering from anemia, a seriously ill person with paralysis on both sides and ravaged by numerous ailments, a desert, and some even say a stagnant pool.</p>
<p>Native-Born, Native-Grown: Senators Dare to Speak</p>
<p>First of all, the reporter must thank the establishment of the Changchun Provisional Senate. It allows me, as an audience member in the venue, to hear those who are "eloquent" report on their actual life experiences in recent years, or, to put it more seriously, report on their actual work situation in recent years.</p>
<p>The Changchun Provisional Senate was formally established on November 22nd. After its establishment, it continued to hold general meetings, which have not yet adjourned. There are a total of 31 senators in this assembly. Eight of them are from the countryside because there are eight districts in Changchun that fall within the city limits, but are inhabited entirely by farmers who make a living by farming. There are also representatives elected by labor unions, and their proposals and inquiries invariably emphasize the interests of workers as more sacred than the interests represented by any other representative. Elementary school teachers desperately exaggerate matters related to elementary school students. There are also two white-bearded elders who insist that the city government's five-hundred-person chorus of male and female middle school students on Double Tenth Day was "indecent" and that the mixing of sexes was too unrefined. What's more, several young lads, when discussing the proposal to eliminate superstition, shouted loudly, ordering the complete shutdown of factories that made joss paper and "shantytowns" that made paper figures of people and horses, because they were the main culprits in promoting the existence of superstition! The reporter wants to particularly emphasize this point: Indeed, some of the senators are people who have not seen much of the world. They are not only native-born and raised in Northeast China but also native-born and raised in the rural areas of Northeast China. However, they dare to speak boldly. One thing is a pity: among the 31 senators, there is not a single woman. Strangely, the female citizens in the audience have also been as rare as morning stars in recent days.</p>
<h3>Two Slogans: Production is More Important Than Taxation; Developing Resources is More Important Than Cutting Costs</h3>
<p>Relying solely on taxation is not a viable method. Therefore, Director Xiao Renshu proposed two "slogans" as the standard for today's efforts to solve Changchun's financial problems: "Production is more important than taxation; developing resources is more important than cutting costs." What does developing production and resources mean? According to Xiao's opinion: (1) Open up production enterprises, because although Changchun does not occupy an important position in the production enterprises of Northeast China, it is secondary; and most of these were contributed and established by the hard work of the citizens, so a part of it should be taken out for the enjoyment of the general public. For example, if the Changchun Cigarette Factory were operated by the city government, the city government's expenses could be greatly improved, but this factory was taken over by the Jilin Provincial Government. (2) Under the arrangement of real estate rent, a monthly income of 20 to 30 million yuan is not a problem, but what belongs to the central government has been taken over by the central government; and what does not belong to the central government has been taken over by the Real Estate Management Bureau. (3) Establishing a municipal bank can make capital more active, unlike the National Bank, which is subject to excessive restrictions. The municipal bank can transfer existing funds from the four major banks, which will naturally make the market prosper and the city government's finances will naturally benefit from it. (4) Rectify tax collection so that municipal tax revenues can be fully credited to the public, which will greatly benefit the city government. (5) Establish a trading market to prevent taxes on livestock and grain from being evaded. (6) Make good use of post-war relief supplies. (7) Promote the circulation of materials and strive to meet the requirements of smooth flow of goods.</p>
<h3>Police Reform: The Authorities Spare No Effort</h3>
<p>In Northeast China, due to the influence of the enemy and puppet regimes, "police" is always used interchangeably with "secret agents." When people mention "police" and "secret agents," people in Northeast China cannot help but feel disgusted and resentful. Because in the hands of the "police" and "secret agents," under the names of "ideological criminals" and "economic criminals," countless people were separated from their parents, children from their parents, and wives from their husbands. They were the hatchet men raised by the Japanese, the creators of human tragedies of life and death, the demons who killed without batting an eye, and the utter bastards who only knew themselves and not others.</p>
<p>After the central government took over Northeast China, the most headache-inducing thing was the establishment of a new police administration. Because to make the people of Northeast China change their minds, one must first try to completely eliminate all the bad habits of the past police and let these pro-people police officers gain new recognition from the people through new behaviors.</p>
<p>After the National Army entered Changchun at the end of May, considerable effort was put into rectifying the police administration. In addition to establishing a police training school on July 1, which has now trained three classes, totaling 547 police officers, daily training is also implemented, with two hours of training each day, as well as training during memorial weeks and various gatherings. However, after the police report, all the senators stood up enthusiastically to question, saying that on November 24, the police, while on patrol duty in the early morning, shot and killed an old man named Fu Shuming, who was holding a pickaxe and prying open the floor of an empty house near the Xiyang District. The police said that because they saw Fu approaching with an object, "the scene was not good, so they opened fire," which is indeed suspected of major negligence of human life. In addition, the police also accepted civil and criminal lawsuits in the suburban countryside, randomly beat and detained people, and judged matters of "marriage and land" in a complete mess.</p>
<h3>The Karma of the Big-Nosed Soldiers: Forming Pain Between Young Couples</h3>
<p>In the police report, there was a report that everyone paid special attention to. That report was a statistical figure, which was the result of an investigation into some of the things that the people of Changchun were unwilling to experience after the Soviet army entered Changchun. The statistics are: 28 cases of rape, 53 cases of arson and murder, 2,842 cases of looting, and 16 cases of destruction, totaling 2,939 cases.</p>
<p>Even now, while the Provisional Senate is in session, such a bizarre thing has happened in Changchun. It can be said to be an embodiment of one of those statistics mentioned above.</p>
<p>A young couple, with deep affection for each other. One dark night last winter, a big-nosed soldier broke into their house. Without saying a word, he forcibly assaulted the woman before leaving. The young husband felt that this kind of "disaster" was irresistible and still treated his wife well. The wife originally wanted to die in anger, but seeing this, her love increased, and the two became even more "affectionate." Unfortunately, in October of this year, a child was suddenly born, and his physical features were unusual. After a doctor's examination, it was proven to be a thoroughbred mixed-race child. The young husband couldn't help but wonder if conception was possible after forced intercourse. The doctor replied that it was possible. But if this child is around, it will cause unpleasant feelings between the couple, and they are thinking of putting him to death. Friends advised: The little life itself is innocent, and there is no need to kill. If this child really evokes painful memories, then giving the child away to others is also an option.</p>
<p>Incidents like this are not uncommon, which can also explain one of the reasons why the people of Northeast China have unpleasant feelings towards certain people.</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Achievements of October</h3>
<p>From "April 14th" this year, tracing back to December 22, 1945, the Changchun Municipal Government was engaged in taking over and promoting public administration under the occupation of the Soviet army. During this period, there are four things that can be said.</p>
<p>(1) Organize the Enemy and Puppet Industry Custody Committee. This organization was composed of local gentry and various agencies and organizations convened by the city government. They jointly took responsibility for the custody of enemy and puppet industries, compiled a list, so as to avoid losses, and prepared to hand them over to the people sent by the central government who were responsible for taking over.</p>
<p>(2) Organize the Property Adjustment Committee. This organization aims to take care of all enemy and puppet houses, so as to prevent them from being occupied by others. At the same time, it pays more attention to distributing some houses as civilian residences.</p>
<p>(3) Preventing corruption. At the beginning of the takeover, there were deep fears that unscrupulous officials would take the opportunity to engage in malpractice. As a result, one division chief and three takeover personnel were found to be derelict in their duties and were all punished.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganize the baojia system. At the beginning of the restoration, there was no way to talk about household registration and security. After the takeover, they started to handle it, with a total of more than 800,000 people. The situation at that time was quite effective.</p>
<p>From "May 23rd" to the present, the following points can be described:</p>
<p>(1) Sending back Japanese nationals and prisoners. Changchun has done a good job in handling this matter. The work of leaving behind Japanese nationals and prisoners in Northeast China began on May 17, while Changchun began after the National Army entered. Changchun has a total of more than 200,000 people left behind.</p>
<p>(2) Implementing baojia and police joint patrols. This is for the winter defense period, so that the people's strength can cooperate with the police to handle sentry duty, patrols, and household registration investigations. It is currently being actively promoted.</p>
<p>(3) Stabilizing commodity prices, wages, and rents. Regarding commodity prices, wages, and rents, price negotiation methods are adopted, and prices are jointly negotiated by various relevant groups, and then approved and implemented by the city government.</p>
<p>(4) Supporting cultural undertakings. In accordance with the central government's orders, citizens have extreme freedom of speech and publication. Therefore, there are quite a few newspapers and magazines published in Changchun.</p>
<p>(5) Appeasing young people. In the summer, they cooperated with the Forward Command Post of the Chief Executive's Office to run a summer training camp for young people, accommodating young people returning from the north of the Songhua River. It has also solved the employment problem for some of the trainees.</p>
<p>(6) Rectifying municipal finances. In accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, streamlining administration and reducing staff, and delaying the handling of non-urgent needs. At the same time, the city's finances are working hard to develop resources and reduce expenditure.</p>
<p>(7) Improving public utilities and health undertakings. Improving tap water, especially paying attention to the cleanliness of drinking water. City trams and buses were completely destroyed in the war, but after active repairs, the number of vehicles operating in the city has greatly increased. The prevention of epidemics will not hesitate to use human and financial resources to handle.</p>
<p>(8) Strengthening education. Changchun not only seeks to increase the number of students, but also improves the quality of teachers, has held teacher training seminars for many times, and strengthens normal schools.</p>
<p>(9) Improving police administration. Changing the police's concept, cracking down on high-pressure work styles, improving service spirit, and cultivating patriotism. Especially in order to meet the requirement of Changchun's first priority for public security, all police facilities are mainly to cooperate with the military.</p>
<p>(10) Clearing real estate and land administration construction. In the past, real estate files were unfortunately destroyed in the "April 14th" fire, and now the takeover work is still not completed, and the ownership of enemy and puppet industries has not been determined, so a new Land Administration Bureau has been established, which will cooperate with the Finance Bureau in the future to be responsible for clearing and adjusting land administration and real estate.</p>
<p>The above are all the work achievements reported, and of course, there are also ongoing ones. However, from here, one can get a glimpse of the achievements of October.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward: Changchun Has Its Own Future</h3>
<p>Changchun is currently in suffering. But precisely because of this, people see its "desolate" current situation. Inevitably, there are many feelings. In reality, Changchun has its own "future." Looking ahead, Changchun really has its beautiful future.</p>
<p>Changchun is located in the center of nine provinces, is an important town in Northeast China, is the capital of the puppet Manchuria, and is an important stronghold on the Sino-Soviet Railway connecting Europe and Asia. In a word, it is the first key artery on China's lifeline.</p>
<p>However, the serious fact at present is that the city's finances are insufficient. In such a magnificent city, it is desperately poor. If a fundamental solution to the financial resources is not considered, then the people of Changchun will not be able to maintain this city, nor will they be able to ensure that this city, built with the hard work of the people of Northeast China, will not change its old appearance for a long time. Not to mention reconstruction or anything else. Therefore, the senators of the Provisional Senate suggested that Changchun be changed to a secondary capital, Changchun be changed to a municipality directly under the central government, and that the Executive Yuan be stationed in Changchun, etc. Rather than looking at it from a positive perspective, saying that it is seeking to rebuild Changchun, it is better to look at it from a negative perspective, saying that it is seeking a solution to Changchun's financial resources. At the same time, it was also reported at the Provisional Senate: Although Shanghai and Tianjin are also municipalities directly under the central government, they are also cities with severe budget surpluses. Therefore, Changchun's request to be a municipality directly under the central government should be approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Penghu: The Key to Tainan</h3>
<p>— Report on the 4th by He Minxian</p>
<p>Harbors and Bays Intertwined, Islands Stretching Across</p>
<p>The coastline of Penghu Island is winding and tortuous, with capes and headlands interlocking. The bay forms a peninsula, with an area of ​​four square miles, and the coastline is as long as five hundred miles. Facing Yuweng Island in the west, it forms a large bay, and the water depth can accommodate thousands of ships. However, crossing the current Taiwan Strait, the situation is extremely dangerous. Ships sailing on the sea must enter Penghu to take shelter in case of a storm, so as to avoid capsizing. The main ports are: Magong, Shili, Liangwen Port, Nanliao, Tudigongqian, Shasu, Zhenhai, Chikan, Tongliang, Da'ao Ye, Zhugao Bay, Jima Creek, Neian, Waianmen, Jiangjun'ao, Budai, Shui'an, etc. Of the eighteen, the east and west bays of Magong are the largest harbors, and the anchorage west of Xiangkou is 24 to 50 feet deep, with an area of 238,000 ping. Since ancient times, the islands of Penghu have been said to be 36 islands and 72 islets, or 49, or 55. In fact, according to precise surveys, there are only 64. Although the number of large and small islands and reefs included is said to reach more than 60, only 44 of them can be called islets. All can be divided into two groups: (A) Penghu Island Group (the collective name of Penghu Island, Baisha Island, Yuweng Island, and their affiliated islands, etc.). (B) Eight-Embrace Islands (the collective name of the Eight-Embrace Port, Jiangjunyu, Dongjiyu, Xijiyu, Dongyuping, Xiyuping, Dayu, Huayu, and their affiliated islands, etc.). Penghu Islands are the collective name of Penghu Island Group and Eight-Embrace Islands. This island (Dashan Island, namely Penghu Island) is in the center, the Eight-Embrace Islands in the south, Jibeiyu in the north, and Zhapo and Zhamu and other islands in the east. In the west, Yuweng Island (Xiyu) is sparsely and densely distributed, and they are layered one upon another, guarding the key point of the Taiwan Strait. Therefore, ships sailing nearby must use this island as the standard for their routes. However, the waves in the bay are turbulent, and the feet of the islands are densely covered with hidden reefs. It is not easy to moor for those who are not familiar with the waterways. The names of the islands are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) There are 31 in the northern part of the island: (Baishayu, Nanmianguayu, Zhongdunyu, Jianyu, Junyu, Baishayu (two with the same name), Dacangyu, Yuanbeiyu, Jibeiyu, Woyu, Daxueyu, Yanqingyu, Jinyu, Maochangyu, Daoyu, Xiaoyu, Pingqiyu, Tudifengyu, Jilongyu, Baishayu (three with the same name), Caoyu (two with the same name), Xianjiaoyu, Niumujianyu, Hai'anzai, Baishadao, Tiezhenyu, Gupoyu, Maosiyu, Mudouyu, Quzhuayu, Beijiao.)</p>
<p>(B) There are 5 in the central part of the island: (Zhapoyu—Yangyu, Zhamuyu—Yinyu, Xiangjinyu, Dingdiaoyu, Jishanyu.)</p>
<p>(C) There are 20 in the southern part of the island: (Ba Zhaodao, Jinguazai, Jiangjunyao, Yuhou, Dizai, Toujin, Liyue, Ma'anshan Yu, Goushayu, Chuanfanyu, Dayu, Xiyuping, Dongyuping, Zhongzaiyu, Dongjiyu, Huayu, Xiaomaoyu, Damaoyu, Chutouyu, Caoyu (two with the same name).)</p>
<p>(D) There are 5 in the western part of the island: (Cetian Island—Xiao'anyu, Tongpanyu, Xiaomenyu, Hujingdao, Yuhua Wei Niao—Xiyu.)</p>
<p>Among the above islands, there are the most 31 in the northern part, and the least 5 each in the capital, western part. As for the area comparison, the area of ​​the main island is more than four square miles, and the combined area of ​​the 63 affiliated islands also reaches more than four square miles, which is similar to that of the main island, which is extremely coincidental. As for the origin of the island names, most of them are named after their shapes. The easternmost island is Zhamuyu, the westernmost is Huayu, the southernmost is Dayu, and the northernmost is Mudouyu.</p>

<h3>The Morality of Writing</h3>
<p>— Chuantong Xian</p>
<p>Recently, this publication received a manuscript. It mentioned that a "Chemical Calculation Method" published by Kaiming in 1939 has recently been copied and published with a clever disguise. The analysis and comparison between the two are quite detailed, but unfortunately, due to space limitations, it could not be published. However, this made me think about the morality of writers. Writing is originally a very bitter thing. If someone makes a living by writing, it is already a dead end. If someone steals and exploits, it is simply too heartless.</p>
<p>This also makes me think of the lawsuit ten years ago between two bookstores because the English textbooks published by the two were similar. Some people say that Chinese people have a problem, that is, they don't know how to work hard to create. When they see that others have achieved a little success or made a little profit in a certain area, they rise up to follow, imitate, and counterfeit. For example, in Shanghai, no one knows which is the real one. What is strange is that this phenomenon can also occur in the publishing industry, which has a higher cultural level in China. Why can't we strive for progress and strive for improvement? We must find ways to eliminate this speculative psychology.</p>
<p>The Chinese publishing industry is extremely lacking in both material and spiritual aspects. This is undeniable. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that people with capital will engage in the publishing industry, and the government will find ways to support them (such as issuing loans and exempting sales tax on publications). On the other hand, writers should enrich their own content, work hard in research, and maintain a noble personality. At the very least, we must maintain the minimum level of morality in writing.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to "Daily Chronicle of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"—A Veritable History</h3>
<p>— Luo Hongtao</p>
<p>Written by Guo Tingyi</p>
<p>Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Over 1,400 pages</p>
<p>Price: 18,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's capital, Tianjing, fell to the Qing army on July 19, 1864 (corresponding to the 16th day of the sixth month of the third year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty). More than eighty years have passed since its destruction, yet there is still no complete record of this great revolutionary movement. This is truly a great shame for historians. Now, the publication of Mr. Guo's book is sufficient to fill this major gap and is indeed a great boon to the academic community. It is observed that people's perspectives on the historical facts of the Taiping Rebellion can be divided into four periods. After its demise, both the Qing court above and the British and French imperialists from abroad jointly engaged in malicious counter-propaganda, vilifying the Taiping army to the point where they were considered worse than bandits and brigands. Simultaneously, the populace fabricated various imagined and brutal events. This constitutes the first period. Around the time of the founding of the Republic of China, the revolutionary atmosphere was already stirring, and people generally recognized the Taiping army as revolutionary martyrs. Consequently, various historical materials were fabricated (as Mr. Liu Yazi wrote on August 20th of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], the original edition of Shi Dakai's poetry collection was edited by his deceased friend Gao Tianmei. Much of it was fabricated, mostly by Tianmei himself, as the purpose at the time was to promote revolution, using writing as a tool for propaganda. This can serve as a confirmation of this claim). Moreover, based on imagination, events that were seemingly true but actually false, such as Hong Xiuquan being a disciple of Zhu Jiuyu, Hong Daquan being named the Heavenly Virtue King, and Qian Jiang submitting memorials, were created. This constitutes the second period. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], Liu Niu Chenruo copied and printed sixteen interesting documents related to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom from the British Museum. Since then, an increasing number of people have been excavating historical materials related to the Taiping Rebellion from abroad. Mr. Cheng Yansheng from the library of the School of Oriental Languages in Paris; Mr. Xiao Yishan from the Oriental Department of the British Museum in London; Mr. Wang Zhongmin from the Cambridge University Library in England; and Mr. Yu Dawei from the Prussian State Library in Berlin, all made significant discoveries. (According to scholars, among the four mentioned above, Mr. Xiao's findings were the most abundant, and Mr. Yu's were the most refined. Mr. Yu's portion was proofread by Mr. Zhang Jusheng and compiled into my humble edition of "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poetry and Prose Excerpts," which, regrettably, is now out of print.) The Palace Museum in China has also unveiled related original historical materials. These secrets, hidden for a century, are now re-emerging to the world, greatly aiding research. This constitutes the third period. However, although studying the historical facts of the Taiping Rebellion has become a trend among historians, the findings have been fragmented, and no one has been able to conduct a comprehensive study. This begins with Mr. Guo's book. In the preface, Mr. Luo Jialun stated that Mr. Guo spent over a decade silently working on this problem before achieving this great harvest. Mr. Guo himself, however, views his work modestly, considering his book a tool-like historical record, only seeking to prepare the groundwork for others, hoping that historians with talent and learning can benefit from this convenience and produce a complete record. This is said to be the fourth period. Frankly speaking, Mr. Guo's work is successful at the present time.</p>
<p>The book's chronology starts from the first year of the Jiaqing reign and ends in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In addition to specifically recording the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion, it also attempts to describe the background of this great turmoil, such as the unrest during the Jiaqing and Daoguang reigns, popular uprisings in various regions, and the activities of the Tiandihui and the Triads, all within the scope of the record. The facts recorded consider all aspects, but limited by materials, military battle records constitute a large part. The recorded facts are arranged chronologically. The dates recorded include both the Chinese and Western calendars. Additionally, the new calendar implemented by the Taiping army, if verifiable, is also appended. The facts for each date are carefully verified. Those involving ambiguities are extensively researched and explained, truly worthy of being considered an excellent work. Simultaneously, the author believes that local gazetteers contain some important information not found elsewhere and therefore extensively utilizes them. This is a new path opened for those studying the history of the Taiping Rebellion. Although he was able to borrow reference books from Tsinghua, Central, Yenching, and Jinling Universities, as well as libraries such as the Central Political Library and the Peiping and Nanjing National Studies Libraries, giving him good advantages, his dedication to research is also admirable.</p>
<p>The main text of this book deserves praise, and the eight appendices attached are also worth introducing.</p>
<p>Appendix 1: Comparison of the Heavenly Calendar with the Lunar Calendar and a simplified table of days of the week. Several people have done this kind of work before Mr. Guo. However, the Heavenly Calendar's sexagenary cycle is not consistent with the lunar calendar's sexagenary cycle, differing by one day. Similarly, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's day of the week does not correspond to the Western day of the week, also being one day earlier. Due to these two differences, previous works were completely abandoned. Mr. Guo's table, however, is worth using and guaranteed to be without error.</p>
<p>Appendix 2: Table of Figures of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. This is simply a small-scale biographical dictionary of the Taiping Rebellion. It begins with an explanation of ranks and titles, with detailed textual research. Each table is divided into ranks, names, birthplaces, experiences, birth and death dates, and annotations. The recorded events are rich, and the lookup is convenient, suitable for application.</p>
<p>Appendix 3: Table of Generals in Major Battles. Each battle records its commanders, subordinates, location, and opposing commanders. There are a total of eighteen tables on the Taiping army side and seven tables on the Qing side. These twenty-five tables could not have been written without having all the historical facts captured in one's mind. This is a truly rare effort.</p>
<p>Appendix 4: War Maps of the Hong and Qing Armies; a total of fourteen maps. "Left is the map, right is the history," as was valued in ancient times. With these maps, it will be even more interesting to study history. Mr. Luo Jialun also stated in his preface that the method of attaching maps is a modern concept. It would not have been possible without the progress of modern technology.</p>
<p>Appendix 5: Table of High Officials of the Qing Dynasty. Appendix 6: Table of Commanders in the Suppression of the Nian Rebellion. The two tables separately record positions, names, tenures, original positions, garrisons, and annotations, which helps with lookup. Appendix 7: Brief Biographies of Hong and Qing Generals. The collection is extensive, recording…</p>
<p>Appendix 8: Bibliography. The books recorded are limited to those that Mr. Guo has consulted and used as a basis for compilation. The books are divided into two parts: one is Chinese, with 197 titles, plus 380 local gazetteers, and 8 periodicals; the other is Western, with 43 titles. After each title, a brief explanation and commentary are added to clarify its nature. More than six hundred books were used. However, what the writer can say is that Mr. Guo's table is not intended to boast about his extensive collection. In reality, Mr. Guo did indeed quote each one individually. This is why it is so commendable.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stated that Mr. Guo's book is an indispensable book for those studying the history of the Taiping Rebellion. Mr. Xiao Yishan is a leading authority on the history of the Qing Dynasty and has also contributed greatly to the study of the history of the Taiping Rebellion, possessing the most historical records related to the Taiping Rebellion. Mr. Guo's book should have been seen by him long ago. However, in recent correspondence, it was learned that he still regrets not having seen this book. Experts are still like this, let alone others. Therefore, without fear of being meddlesome, I am writing this article to introduce it.</p>
<h3>A Masterpiece of Human Geography: "The Geographical Basis of China"</h3>
<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>Authored by George B. Cressey, translated by Xue Yiyuan</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore, September of the 35th year of the Republic [1946]</p>
<p>The relationship between geography and human life is the closest. It can be said that our understanding of the various human affairs in China depends on the study of geography, because only through it can we understand the factors of agriculture, resources, climate, regions, and human life.</p>
<p>Professor George B. Cressey, the author of this book, resided in China for a long time and completed this work after more than ten years of research and travel. At the same time, this work is precisely the result of his more than ten years of hard work. The author served in China as a visiting professor under the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department, and as a representative in China for both the American Council of Learned Societies and the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. Due to these many conveniences, his research was even better than that of the people of our own country. Chinese geographers have never had the opportunity to conduct such long-term research, consuming so much funding. Therefore, although the author is an American, this book is still one of the more accomplished new geographical works in Chinese geography.</p>
<p>Today, this book is worth reading whether you are a geographer or not, just as the author states in his original preface: "China is now in the midst of unprecedented social, economic, and political adjustments. A great nation, traditionally isolated and conservative, is now rapidly renewing its life and becoming a member of the family of nations. Geography cannot claim to solve all the problems arising from this transformation, but it can shed light on some of the background of this evolution."</p>
<p>The Social Geographical Basis</p>
<p>This volume, "The Geographical Basis of China," is the general discussion part of George B. Cressey's geographical works on China, divided into six parts to separately explain: Geographical Landscapes, Topography, Climate, Farmers, Natural Resources, and World Relations.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at its contents: In the first chapter, "Geographical Landscapes," it points out that the most important factor in China's landscape is not soil, vegetation, or climate, but the people. This, we can believe. It is difficult to find a small piece of land on this ancient land of China that has not been rendered by human activity. At the same time, the author also points out China's natural isolation. In the past history, China was surrounded by obstacles, and had not been in contact with other parts of the world, so there was little exchange of knowledge. That is, the tropical jungle, the tall mountains, the vast deserts, and the vast oceans together maintained China's unity and isolation.</p>
<p>In "The Foundations of Social Environment," Thomas said: "It is now generally recognized that the most important factor in cultural progress is the contact of diverse cultures, while stagnation is caused by isolation. A certain environment is sufficient to touch another environment and provide a passage, to communicate with another area, which will encourage the susceptibility of people's minds and the progress of culture; conversely, an isolated environment will inevitably lead to psychological stagnation and repetition."</p>
<p>From this, we can understand the reasons for China's backwardness in science.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes contrasting places, charting the contrast between the South and the North, the pressure of population; and explaining the new and old transportation, listing tables of cars and highways in various places.</p>
<p>The author's concluding paragraph, "Understanding China," is inaccurate in several places because of the different era in which it was written. But as a reference, it is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>The Relationship between Climate and Farmland</p>
<p>In the second chapter, "Topography," it explains the geological foundation. China certainly does not have the glacial features of Europe and North America, but the author lists our characteristics. We cannot introduce them one by one here.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding mountains, rivers, alluvial plains, coastal seas, and changes in the Chinese territory, the author uses very sufficient materials to explain; and lists the population and area surveys of Chinese provinces for reference.</p>
<p>Climate—the factor that determines human activities—is discussed in Chapter 3 of this book. It describes the physics of China's climate, which is the monsoon operation that is sequentially transformed by topography and marine relations, the occasional tropical cyclone, and a series of continental storms that produce a climate zone. It also fully elaborates on the relationship between climate and life, and includes wind direction illustrations and tables of average temperature and average rainfall.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is about "Farmers for Four Thousand Years." Of course, China is known as an agricultural country, and agricultural issues are the most important. In this chapter, the author first explains the morning landscape, and then returns to the foundation of agriculture, and the wide expression of cultivated land in China, lists and explains the cultivated land of the past dynasties and the cultivated land of various provinces, and also reports the detailed tables of cultivated land and crop area in various provinces. Crop yields are also explained in the table.</p>
<p>China's agricultural problems are still today. The author pointed out the general nature of the importance of China's agricultural problems in the past. China's fisheries can be science, and the transformation of society is needed. After the basic knots of the current situation are lifted, it can embark on this road.</p>
<p>The issue of natural resources is discussed in Chapter 5, which first discusses the historical background; the source of coal and the world's coal reserves, extending to the most important power—coal mining. Then, the storage estimates of coal and the coal production of each mine are listed and explained separately.</p>
<p>Other power sources, such as oil. The explanations of iron and other gold, non-gold, and non-metal types are also attached with tables; the chapter comes to explain China's mineral production and the prospects for China's industry.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to China's Trade</p>
<p>The last chapter is "China's Relations with the World." The author describes its historical background. China's furthest westward expedition and trade began only during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. By the 19th century, export trade gradually increased, and it lists and explains the goods directly exported to foreign countries, and the comparison of foreign trade commodities.</p>
<p>Of course, weaving trade is far beyond export trade. After the Opium War, international capitalism opened up China's independent and autonomous , and created the semi-colonial status mentioned by Sun Yat-sen. The author of this book also pointed out: "For many years, the value of tangible imports has greatly exceeded the value of exports. This so-called unfavorable trade balance has become increasingly harmful in recent years."</p>
<p>Finally, it explains China's trade and the foreign trade of various ports. So far, this book has come to an end.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we have a basic understanding of China's geography. Therefore, this book can be used as a basic understanding for young people in learning.</p>

<h3>Rereading "Fathers and Sons"</h3>
<p>— Xinjun</p>
<p>Written by Turgenev, translated by Ba Jin</p>
<p>Published by Cultural Life Press, September of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], 365 pages</p>
<p>In the field of literature and art, French romantic literature, with its gorgeous writing, has attracted a wide range of readers. From this, we think of Turgenev, a famous writer. His novels and prose poems have intoxicated countless young people. Turgenev himself was Russian and of aristocratic descent. But he studied in France, so his works cannot escape the colors of French romanticism.</p>
<p>Most of Turgenev's works take the resistance of young people against the old forces during the Tsarist era in Soviet Russia as the theme. However, he only describes it from the side, using his refined writing and the "nihilistic" soul to depict those immortal figures in literature and art.</p>
<p>The novel "Fathers and Sons" depicts the conflict between new and old ideas in the era of the emancipation of serfs in Soviet Russia, and develops it through the prism of his view of life with his beautiful style.</p>
<p>The content of this novel is roughly:</p>
<p>A progressive landlord, a descendant of Russian aristocracy—Nikolai, and his son—Arkady, who returned home from the University of St. Petersburg, are the central figures. The author developed a magnificent masterpiece from the characters of the two.</p>
<p>Arkady is a mindless believer in nihilism, and it was his classmate Bazarov who gave him this confidence; this time he came home with Bazarov. Therefore, he criticized all of his father Nikolai's actions with his nihilistic eyes. And sometimes made his old father feel very unhappy.</p>
<p>Nikolai has an older brother, Pavel, who is a full-fledged maintainer of aristocratic dignity, a stubborn old man, so Bazarov often argues with him.</p>
<p>After a few days, the two like-minded nihilists met a beautiful Mrs. Anna at a welcome party; as a result, they unknowingly fell into the city of love, and all their actions in front of Anna seemed to be different from the past.</p>
<p>After the two nihilists walked into Anna's manor together, Bazarov gained victory. But Arkady was also very passionate about Anna's sister, Katya.</p>
<p>Soon, the two of them felt that it was not worth only going into the horns of love. So they broke away from the entanglement of love, and went to Bazarov's home to live together. Bazarov's father was a bright little serf. After they arrived there, the shackles of love did not break away from them; Arkady ran to Anna's manor on the pretext of Bazarov, then thought of Nikolai's "beloved concubine" Feni, and went to Nikolai's house, and got the chance to kiss Feni twice.</p>
<p>This secret was known by Nikolai's stubborn brother Pavel, and he was furious and agreed to duel with Bazarov. In the end of the duel, the stubborn old man was injured. Because of this lesson, the old man changed his previous stubbornness and compromised with the new trend.</p>
<p>Bazarov could no longer live in Nikolai's house; after he left, he ran to Anna and told Arkady about it, and also met Anna, and finally returned to his own father's farm.</p>
<p>Here, Nikolai, because of his changed brother's persuasion, broke the concept of class and formally held a wedding with Feni. Arkady also fell in love with Anna's sister and successfully married her father on the same day.</p>
<p>Fathers and sons combined two pairs of newlyweds on the same auspicious day; afterwards, the father and son jointly managed agriculture and did very well; the families were also very harmonious, and they lived a sweet life in that beautiful and happy environment.</p>
<p>What about Bazarov? After he returned home, he was engaged in the work of providing medical treatment to farmers, but, in a certain anatomy, he carelessly contracted a terrible disease and ended his life.</p>
<p>Bazarov's parents often confessed and wept in front of their son's coffin.</p>
<p>This masterpiece has reached its last page here.</p>
<p>After reading this work, it is very clear that it uses the ups and downs of love as a clue, fully expressing the atmosphere of romanticism and its non-reality. In the entanglements of love, various ideas are silenced.</p>
<p>Bazarov, originally a forward-thinking person, is encountering obstacles and suffering everywhere here. In the end, he destroyed himself.</p>
<p>Arkady, although he is an admirer of Bazarov, does not have the rebellious training of Bazarov; he was loved by his father and uncle, and as a result, he also became a follower of the cause.</p>
<p>What about Nikolai? His advanced thinking, cooperating with his son, entered a pink and happy family; his brother also reformed a stubborn aristocratic self-esteem and achieved a compromise.</p>
<p>This work has undeniable skills in its artistic quality in terms of literary description. The structure is also considered perfect. Only in terms of consciousness, as mentioned earlier, it cannot match the facts, and it is all in the manner of philistinism.</p>
<p>It uses a satirical pen to write about a forward-thinking youth destroying himself, while on the aristocratic side, the author has sympathy. Pavel's compromise and the sweet life of Nikolai's father and son are in contrast to Bazarov.</p>
<p>The writing of this work is very worthy of learning, because this work is a very good masterpiece to it as a constant artwork. The translator Ba Jin translated it based on the English version, and the translation is fairly fluent, but it may not be completely consistent with the original version. In short, this is a very beautiful artistic work!</p>
<h3>Concerning the Soviets</h3>
<p>— Nine Chapters</p>
<p>A. WHITE: A REPORT ON THE RUSSIANS</p>
<p>The author of this book, Mr. White, visited the Soviet Union in the summer of 1944, when US-Soviet relations were extremely harmonious. He received "special permission" to "see what he wanted to see and write what he wanted to write after returning home." He visited the Malar industrial area in the heart of the Soviet Union, a place no foreigner had been to since the start of the 1926 Five-Year Plan. He entered the newly recovered rural areas of Ukraine, talking to farmers, hoping to hear their true innermost thoughts. Of course, there were one or two occasions when the iron fist of ideological control prevented Mr. White's freedom of access. They visited a factory in Siberia, where he had a very pleasant conversation with a German-speaking female worker. But as soon as White turned away, a secret policeman (NKVD, formerly GPU) spoke to her, and she became utterly submissive or silent. "In the Soviet Union, where can anyone freely talk to foreigners?" But, on the whole, Mr. White's group had a very free visit. In particular, he debated with a female translator in Moscow, frankly stating where he thought the Soviet Union was inferior to the United States; the frankness of this would probably surprise readers.</p>
<p>I am personally particularly interested in what life is like for ordinary Soviets. The author's viewpoint happens to be the same: he does not vaguely discuss Soviet policy, but often wants to know a worker's daily expenses. The standard of living of ordinary people is an achievement of governance and cannot be considered a military secret. Treating this kind of material as a military secret, thereby arousing suspicion, is always an unwise move.</p>
<p>In the third chapter, the author recounts his visit to three Moscow factories: an aircraft factory, an automobile factory, and a biscuit factory. In the first factory, he inquired about working hours and wages. Ordinary workers worked sixty-six hours a week and earned one thousand rubles. Eating one day in the factory cafeteria cost five rubles, which was very cheap. But what could you buy with the remaining eight hundred or more rubles per month? In the "store," ham cost over one thousand rubles a pound, and chicken cost around five hundred rubles a pound. Clothing was even more expensive. So this worker could fill his stomach by eating in the factory cafeteria and spend a few evenings watching plays in designated theaters, but "once he left the factory, his food and clothing immediately became a problem." He could not save money like an American. Mr. White said, "The factory is theoretically owned by the workers, but in reality, the workers belong to the factory."</p>
<p>In the second factory, Mr. White asked the "manager" what would happen if a worker was lazy at work. "First, there is a warning on the bulletin board, and then a speech at the trade union." Mr. White immediately understood! The trade union had become an organization for controlling the workers. On another occasion (Chapter 8), White asked a trade union leader if a worker could go elsewhere if he was dissatisfied with his current job. The answer was "He must apply to the factory." "If he leaves without asking permission, can he find work elsewhere?" The answer was "No, he will have a hard time finding work anywhere in the Soviet Union." Mr. White even asked: "Isn't this equivalent to a blacklist?" The answer was "It can't be considered a blacklist." The American concept of "freedom" cannot be found in the Soviet dictionary. As for the author comparing the lives of Soviet workers to those of American prisoners in the fourth chapter, it may be a bit too indignant. Similarly, "the treatment of workers throughout the Soviet Union is not much different, because all factories belong to the government, and all treatment is stipulated by the government." Some Chinese readers may agree with this approach, but most Americans are not accustomed to it.</p>
<p>"In the Soviet Union, the lives of employed workers are not as good as the lives of workers receiving unemployment benefits during the American economic depression." It is hard to say how reliable this statement is. But even the words of that Soviet female translator in the book can only be considered "comforting oneself." She said? "I myself am suffering, but I know that everyone else is suffering, so I am comforted." People with common sense all know that the banner of socialism is to realize "everyone's paradise," not everyone being equally poor. There will always be a gap between the banner and what is actually done. An ideal will always change somewhat when it is put into practice. This was true before and after the French Revolution, and it is no different with the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>The writer has not studied the economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union and can only briefly discuss what Mr. White believes are the shortcomings of the Soviet Union. (1) It is very difficult for the Soviet government to plan and guide the activities and development of factories throughout the country from one center (the Kremlin). The "managers" or people in charge of each factory tend to become complacent, lack initiative, and some technical and managerial talents are sometimes purged due to political lines. (2) The elimination of the profit motive reduces the desire to compete, and people generally do not want to improve production methods. According to Mr. White, the American system is more stimulating to new inventions than the Soviet system. The Stakhanovite movement was actually a covert restoration of competition, but the encouragement of "medals" is not as good as practical benefits. "Generally speaking, capitalism invents, and socialism imitates." This is White's view.</p>
<p>However, what is read in the book, that is, what the author saw, is that the Soviet Union also has many advantages. For example, the standard of living in the Soviet Union is lower than in the United States, but there are no beggars. During wartime, supplies are always prioritized for frontline soldiers. And the Soviet government is good at dealing with issues between ethnic minorities, etc. The author has never denied this.</p>
<p>Books like "impressions" or "memoirs" have become an important genre in English books. The writing is fluent, like a novel; the observations are insightful, sufficient for experts to extract. This book is also like this. But our post-war publishing industry rarely sees this type of book for the time being.</p>

<h3>Introducing [Meng Jiangnü]</h3>
<p>— Wang Bosheng</p>
<p>As early as twenty-one years ago, I was engaged in the research and improvement of inherent and modern drama art in Beiping. I happened to see the premiere of Mr. Afuxialomov's opera in the Zhenguang Cinema. Twelve years ago, at the Shandong Provincial Drama Academy, I was involved in the pilot performance of the opera Yue Fei. Not long ago, at the National Opera School, together with Zheng Zhisheng, Lin Gangbai, Chen Tianhe, Zhu Chongzhi, and many friends in the music and dance world, I also participated in the experimental performance of the operas Jing Ke, Zheng Chenggong, and Going to the Country. Today, Afuxialomov and Mr. Chen Zhong's Meng Jiangnü has also been performed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Some of the performers this time are former colleagues and classmates, who all told me that this time the approach is the same as our previous experiments in terms of the application of theory and techniques. Therefore, I watched it twice and made a serious introduction and explanation of its constituent principles and its influence on political philosophy and artistic philosophy.</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Why introduce this type of art? From the perspective of political philosophy, since the Three Dynasties in China, due to the influence of feudal thought, the realm of national thought has gradually had invisible constraints, and society has therefore become increasingly rational. In the vast society, a certain attitude and belief have been created in the psychology of the people, so the culture itself has entered a stage of stagnation for two thousand years. This invisibly pathological society has felt the oppression of the international community in various economic aspects in the past century. Later, it became poor due to rationality, so it naturally formed selfishness and infighting, causing the society to fall into a state of collapse, fragmentation, and disunity. This is one of the reasons why Mr. Sun Yat-sen engaged in revolutionary work. After the revolution, followed by the arduous war of resistance, it has also achieved its full success. In terms of political and various improvements before and after the war, all staff who understand the overall situation have done their best under the daily supervision of the leader, but they still cannot save the decline of society in case of emergencies. The problem must have other causes.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the way to revival in the future is science and art. The importance of science is well known, and the importance of art is more important than science, but it is not easy for the general public to understand. For example, in terms of industrial products of natural science, the more real the natural laws found in the universe, the greater the power and the more contribution to mankind. However, no matter whether it is an atomic bomb or an airplane, its performance power is ultimately limited. After all, it is mankind that manipulates the universe and shakes the universe, because mankind has a subtle soul. Therefore, the ancients governed the country and paid attention to the spiritual life of mankind, as well as the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose of the human body, the so-called residence of the soul, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. (Rites) served as the basis for its political measures, so its political philosophy was that rites regulated the people's hearts, music harmonized the people's voices, politics was used to implement them, and punishment was used to prevent them. Rites, music, punishment, and politics reached everywhere without conflict, then the royal way was fully prepared. From this, we know that punishment and politics are inevitable measures, and rites and music are essential elements of life. (Rites are nourishment, and should be seen as the rhythm of time and space art. In terms of human affairs, it is only the measure between people. Please refer to Sima Qian's discussion on rites and music in the Records of the Grand Historian)</p>
<p>Natural science has reached such a complex stage, so the art of cultivating people's hearts must also progress in parallel with the functions of natural science in order to produce a balanced effect. For example, ancient sedan chairs were so good, but no one rides them anymore, because their functions are too far from those of airplanes and trains. Therefore, some of the functions of ancient rites and music should be replaced by musical drama, because music must enter drama to prick people's hearts and respond to people's rhythms. We really cannot think that it is just a kind of decoration for life because there is a drama character, because opera is a powerful organism. The use of lines and colors is the creation of visual science in human spirit, and rhythm and melody are the creation of auditory science in human soul. All progressive arts are sciences that cultivate the soul. Only with good cultivation of the soul can heat occur between people, can people's minds be broadened, can there be elasticity and compassion, and can the society be activated and have new vitality. Therefore, any country with scientific development in Europe and the United States must also be a country with artistic development, because science has a foundation for social peace and governance, and society cannot expect peace and governance without spiritual alignment. There is mutual effect. This is one of the reasons why this kind of art career should be valued.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>From the perspective of the philosophy of contemporary art. Chinese society has fallen into a stage of rational poverty. If art is engaged in provocation or hints of divergence, it is the masses who will be directly harmed. In view of the historical facts of the feudal society that gave us too much rationalization, it seems that we cannot but ask for something in the creation of emotional art, because society cannot be improved by blindly destroying it, nor can it be effective by blindly whipping it.</p>
<p>The following I will say a few words from the point of view of creation, because this is necessary for the analysis of the Meng Jiangnü drama. All kinds of great art, he himself is a kind of beautiful realm, with an inviolable style, with this style, and then can regulate people, a kind of beautiful realm, must have his constituent factors, in music, because there is rhythm so can transcend reality, because transcend reality so people can forget its ugliness, and a kind of beautiful realm and great style, in opera, its success, often does not belong to the success of a kind of expression medium, because it must be the balanced development of various expression media, in order to produce a spiritual and fleshly harmonious organic organization. But sometimes, there are exceptions. If a certain expressive medium has its unique beauty, it can gradually induce other expressive media to cooperate with it, and gradually form a complete organization. For example, the human soul is a congenital endowment, and its clothing and action are dominated by the soul. Although a kind of embellishment sometimes makes people difficult to distinguish between true and false, so how an opera artist grasps the method of opening up and completing things is indeed not an easy thing. The most commendable part of Meng Jiangnü's music and dance is that it has a considerable foundation for the application of this kind of coordination.</p>
<p>What is the independent style of Chinese music? This is the first question to be studied. China is a society of ethics and morality, so in music, it does not create emotions with music, but uses medicine to create its ethical style, which is based on the composition of ethics and morality, so all the arts of its society also have their independent physical states with something to rely on, so there is a head, abdomen, and tail, mostly transcending reality, peace, and the expression of personality. Its value is more focused on personality than on emotions. That is, the bell is used to establish martial arts, the bamboo is used to establish meetings, the drum is used to establish movement, and the chime is used to establish辩. The reason why we cherish our percussion instruments is only for this reason. In terms of the era, the poverty of Chinese music has been swallowed up by the torrent of its era. Mr. Afuxialomov picked up things that had been forgotten for a long time, and gave him rich emotions and the power of the era, making a kind of Chinese unique language (music is the language of the world) become the language of the world, which is indeed a thing worth cherishing. If the chapter of Meng Jiangnü's music can further strengthen the creation of its main melody, so that its character is more powerful, or more extraordinarily distinct.</p>
<p>Regarding the movement, I believe that in the eyes of the artist, there is no distinction between new and old, good or bad for all his expressive media, because everything new mostly comes from the changes of the old. What the artist needs to consider carefully is the balance of power, the harmony of color, the distance of scale, and the speed of rhythm. In terms of movement, rhythm and lines are his expressive media of force. This kind of rhythm can achieve consistent harmony with music, installation, drama, and other related aspects, and it must be successful. Chinese inherent drama has many similarities with Indian drama. The main thing is movement. Two years ago, Zhongnong exchanged opinions with Mr. Gang Ge Li. He deeply praised the place where Chinese drama uses movement to represent words. I think that in drama, there is a need to make further development on the basis of what has already been achieved, because in the arts, it is still a new enlightenment. In the previous performance of Yue Fei, the expression of coordination and incoordination in movement was made, and the harmonic development with the harmony of music, its function sometimes exceeded music, because movement is after all much more distinct than music. The one who actually carried out the directing task of Meng Jiangnü was Mr. Chen Zhong, who had put in a lot of effort, which can be seen. I still hope that they will work harder to make the guests and hosts distinct, have climaxes, be able to increase the changes in patterns, and use movement and stillness more appropriately, so as to strengthen the creation of its character, then for the new harmonious introduction of inherent art, a pattern of independent creation can be established on the modern drama stage.</p>
<p>In terms of installation, its style is generally quite harmonious, but the center of gravity of each painting should still be strengthened, so that all sublimation effects transcend reality and have a basis.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, it is also quite gorgeous, and no major problems can be seen. If you can not stick to historical facts, and increase the expression of character or make it more vivid on the basis of historical facts in lines and colors.</p>
<p>In terms of the drama text, the dialogue of the whole drama should be changed to poetry, and its sentence breaks do not have to follow the inherent yin and yang flat and oblique tones (as in the old drama), but should be created in terms of light and heavy speaking, and on the basis of emotion. As for the structure of the whole drama, the climax of each act, and the climax of the whole drama, should be strengthened to make it a three-dimensional style to accommodate all the techniques.</p>
<p>I think everything is easy to change now that she has established a commendable pattern, because these are all trivial issues.</p>
<p>From the perspective of political necessity and artistic philosophy, it cannot be said that the performance of Meng Jiangnü is the most cherished work, because under the same principle, our ancient great epics, and all cultural and artistic traces, can be used to have further opportunities to express to people at home and abroad. Although this kind of creation is not impossible for us to grasp ourselves, the examination of musical art is after all a task of genius, and requires a long time to work hard. Afuxialomov has been in China for thirty years. He is welcome to work for the cause of art. Handel was a German who lived in England and became famous. His Messiah oratorio was passed down as a beautiful story in the world because it was revered by the King of England. Chopin was a Pole who also lived in France and became famous, because art is a common property of mankind. As for the plot of the drama, it can be seen that Qin Shihuang is selfish and self-interested, disregarding the hunger and suffering of the people, and only trying to achieve the desire of one family to achieve a foundation for all generations, and making this brutal and unjust act against the public, destroying everything of the people, and building the Great Wall for the sacrifice of one person and one surname, then Wan Xiliang and Meng Jiangnü are only one representative of the whole people. Those who suffer from it are all like this in every family. If we face reality squarely, then after this great war, when people all over the world are suffering, all countries are suffering from expanding their military strength again with all their strength, then this drama cannot be said to be a most meaningful contribution to saving peace and saving the world, because its most cherished place is to regulate people with the style of art.</p>
<h3>Goethe's Quotations</h3>
<p>— Stubborn Stone</p>
<p>Nature is eternally true and serious; it is never wrong. The incompetent cannot see nature, but those who are learned, pursue truth, and are pure in heart can see the mysteries of nature. Nature is constantly in progress, and it curses all lazy behavior.</p>
<p>Error is easier to see than truth, because error is on the outside. So it is easy to see, while truth is underneath, and most people are unwilling to look for it.</p>
<h3>Nude Woman</h3>
<p>— Dai拉克窪</p>
<p>Dai拉克窪 (E. Deracroin 1798-1864) was a traitor among the students of David, an early French classicalist writer. He not only did not inherit his teacher, but also established a new banner and established the Romantic school, causing a great revolution in the art world, and enlightening later generations to establish painting theory. The style is novel, the colors are complex, and the subject matter is mostly legends, myths, and history. "Dante's Boat" is one of his representative works. This nude woman was modeled after a maid in the court at that time. The brushwork is concise and solid (lion).</p>
<h3>Fiddler</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Yandong Hutong is in the western city of Beiping, and even the most detailed map does not contain its name. A secluded neighborhood, except for a few jujube trees bent at the corners of the walls, in the summer, only the rhythmic copper percussion of the water fruit peddlers is heard. On winter nights, the Muezzin chants in a long voice: "Allah Yang Yue..."</p>
<p>At the western end of the hutong is the city wall. The mule cart road is always so gray, deep and thick. Crows gather in flocks on the telephone wires and in the weeds on the city wall. Only the fish-white sky is a suitable view under the line of sight.</p>
<p>Especially in the autumn, I change with this environment. I often carry a lacquered cane that is convenient for use as a weapon for self-defense, and stroll to the vicinity of the city wall for sightseeing. I am very strange that I don't know what motive I have for taking a sightseeing interest in this gray scenery.</p>
<p>One day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, I followed the old road and walked to the bottom of the city wall, intending to go a little further north to find the stone steps that could go up the city for sightseeing. I met a short, fat man wearing a blue cloth gown. His head, like a steamed bun, was shaved very cleanly. He held a few pieces of tofu held in a lotus leaf in his right hand, and carried a bottle of sesame oil in his left hand. He smiled at me and said:</p>
<p>"Sixth Lord, you are really funny, why are you wandering around here?"</p>
<p>I looked at him for a long time.</p>
<p>"You forgot me," he made a grand gesture, choked by phlegm, and said. "Haven't you heard what Qu Ziqiu plays, how much! I live diagonally opposite your master's house."</p>
<p>Oh, yes, his surname is Qi, a fiddler. Every evening, the secluded erhu sound from the opposite courtyard came to my ears from his hands. Due to the inspiration born of art, I could not help but change my stubborn state, with some nostalgic expression, and said:</p>
<p>"It's you! How could I not know. Your craftsmanship, not only now, I have experienced a lot since I was a child. How are you doing now?"</p>
<p>"Alas, don't mention it. Now, now, now there is nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing? Aren't you playing the erhu in the theater anymore?"</p>
<p>"I haven't done this job for two years."</p>
<p>Old Qi's eyes were a little cloudy, like a cloud of sorrow obscuring his mood. Indeed, I have also heard people say that this year, he has only been invited by a few amateur performers in a cold place - Bin Yan Hua Lou. His former glory has disappeared to where he knows. He has become the violin player of those "three people (Trio)" on the road, and sometimes it is difficult to find a partner. Is it because he is old? Or for some other reason, he lost the favor of the old men?</p>
<p>"I can't join the band, Sixth Lord. They are new, - they say they are new, and they regard us as old. The old Min also loves the new, composes new tunes, goes to Harbin, runs to Hong Kong, and Shanghai. I'm left with this unchanged, unmoved one. One is reluctant to part with the cheap coal noodles in Beiping, and the other is because I have an old mother at home. I'm just so frustrated, isn't it my fault?"</p>
<p>"You are too modest, you can start a class and recruit students."</p>
<p>"That's not true! It's easy to say, but it's not easy to say..."</p>
<p>Old Qi seemed to suddenly have an unpleasant thought, holding the tofu, and walked past me. After a few steps, he finished by saying:</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>This time I left Beiping was in 1933, to find a few friends to do a small thing. Who knew that four years later, I still returned to the secluded old residence. I still live in the front courtyard - the room with two jujube trees next to the window. I started doing an editing job - according to the original text of Fan Ben, I extracted the general meaning of the main critical trends of modern times and wrote it into a booklet.</p>
<p>I hope to restore the inspiration of my early years in that light corner, writing prose poetry. But I can no longer hear that elegant erhu sound. This erhu sound, which used to make me nostalgic, fantasize, and sleepless, has now become silent, and I can't help but guess - ah, Old Qi, you are silent... You didn't abandon art, or did he move?</p>
<p>The servant Old Tian told me when I asked him once:</p>
<p>"Old Qi is in jail, and he hasn't come out yet. The year before last, he opened a small grocery store and lost hundreds of dollars. He went back to his hometown to sell land, and got into a lawsuit. He lost the lawsuit, so he was... Alas, what a pity, that good Xipi!"</p>
<p>Writer Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Voltaire</h3>
<p>— Gan Si</p>
<p>In 1717, when the great French writer Voltaire arrived in England, he discovered that the English people were extremely resentful of the French. Walking the streets of London was a dangerous matter for his life. One day, while he was strolling, a group of angry Englishmen shouted, "Kill him, hang this Frenchman!"</p>
<p>Voltaire stood firm and, facing them, said loudly, "Gentlemen of England! You want to kill me because I am a Frenchman! But am I not already severely punished by my misfortune of not being English?"</p>
<p>The crowd couldn't help but cheer and escorted Voltaire safely to his own residence.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 120</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Why did Tsurumi come to Matsushima? Obviously, he knew his plan had failed. He thought he could use the Black Dragon Society, on one hand, to passively reduce the obstructing forces, and on the other hand, perhaps actively obtain more accurate news that could be used to uncover the secret of the "Seven Sealed Letters." Who knew that the Black Dragon Society would give him Pingzi instead, a formidable opponent; moreover, judging from the past dozen hours, he seemed to be still a love-stricken devil, a kind of entanglement hard to break free from.</p>
<p>From the Konoe residence, he realized that Konoe, this glory-hungry, bloodthirsty demon, was not as easy to deal with as he had imagined. In addition, he originally knew that the Fifth Column was quite formidable, but he never dreamed that there would be such alert and agile figures among them. And that elder Aoki was simply an incredible magician, able to grasp metaphysical power and manipulate people's minds. He still didn't know their views on this war of aggression, but if they happened to advocate annexing the entire Asia and becoming world hegemon, thinking like those demons, then their magic group would also be a great obstacle. In other words, Tsurumi wanted to reveal the "secret machinery" by himself and the power of a few comrades, which was tantamount to climbing a tree to catch a fish.</p>
<p>Moreover, listening to Pingzi's tone, there were many factions in Tokyo's political, governmental, military, and business circles, each with considerable power, and they even made a big fuss about his little involvement with the Black Dragon Society. This meant that his plan, before even starting, was already seen as destined to fail. Furthermore, the physical exhaustion of these past two days was also a major factor pushing him into despair. So, he temporarily put everything aside and ran to Matsushima in a puff of smoke. Madam Koyuan and Kikuko possessed a mixed warmth and understanding of mother, lover, and confidante, and the quiet and elegant location and residence were enough to dispel the adverse mood in his heart.</p>
<p>He sat for a while, daydreamed for a while, felt hungry, and put on his slippers to go downstairs. Kikuko was the first to notice Tsurumi coming downstairs, as if she had been waiting at the bottom of the stairs. She first gave Tsurumi a casual greeting, asking if he had slept well, and then, in her sweet and crisp voice, shouted towards the half-open dining room door, "Mom, Yu-ge is coming downstairs." Madam Koyuan also responded from the kitchen, "Kiku-er, quickly open the door to the Buddha hall." Soon, the old lady, who was over sixty but did not appear old, came out of the kitchen with a kind smile on her face.</p>
<p>Kikuko took the lead in opening the door to the Buddha hall, stepping aside to let Tsurumi and her mother enter. This was a small room with four tatami mats, already lit with oil lamps and sesame orchid incense. In the center of the small shrine was a Buddha statue, and below it on the offering table were several framed enlarged photos, one of which was a photo of Koyuan Keikazu, Kikuko's father, taken during his lifetime; and another was a photo of Meizi, Tsurumi's adoptive mother.</p>
<p>Madam Koyuan and Kikuko accompanied Tsurumi in the Buddha hall to pay respects and pray for blessings, and then they walked together to the living room, where everyone met again, exchanged greetings and inquiries, without any nagging or trivialities. At this time, Kikuko showed her housekeeping skills, first serving Tsurumi to sit down, and then instructing the maid to serve dishes and heat wine. This place was filled with warmth: Madam Koyuan sat near the window, watching Tsurumi drink with a smile, saying politely without making people feel embarrassed, "I seemed to have a premonition, so I didn't go to the market today, and I unintentionally bought these snacks, including the small dried fish you usually like, I don't know if your taste has changed..."</p>
<p>Kikuko poured wine cup after cup, occasionally interjecting a few elegant jokes, "Yu-ge's taste won't change much; look, his first chopstick is for fish slices, the second chopstick is also for fish slices, and the third chopstick is still for fish slices."</p>
<h3>To Dr. Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chengbo</p>
<p>Four Seven-Character Quatrains with Preface</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang is fond of books and music, skilled in singing and dancing, and is the leading figure in the Peking Opera world of our time. During the war, he was trapped in enemy territory and sought to escape without success. He grew a mustache and refused to perform; his actions were not far from those who destroyed their appearance and swallowed charcoal to pledge their lives to the country. Is he perhaps a descendant of Lei Haiqing, a Tang musician? After the victory, he opened in Shanghai and performed "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger." Tickets cost tens of thousands of taels of gold, and people rubbed shoulders as if flocking to a market. With both the drama and the person perfect, it is fitting that he attracts so many people! Mirroring Zhang Sheng's love, he defends the chastity of a loyal woman; with an empty flute case, he further shows his determination to care for his homeland. I have written four seven-character quatrains to praise him.</p>
<p>It is when the soldiers break through the enemy's sky,</p>
<p>That the memories of lantern-lit "Rainbow Skirt Dance" arise;</p>
<p>The Peking Opera world has its own sorrowful matters,</p>
<p>Mei's grub has been suffering for ten years.</p>
<p>Ghost fires light up autumn tombs with ten thousand mounds of earth,</p>
<p>The rise and fall of dynasties are like dreams, the waters flow endlessly;</p>
<p>Do not say that no one grows old in the war-torn world,</p>
<p>Dr. Mei today also has white hair.</p>
<p>With red powder and green robe, he shows patriotism,</p>
<p>With a dove-like figure and crane-like face, he is ashamed to steal life;</p>
<p>Now that the talented one has died and Turtle Longevity has aged,</p>
<p>Who else recognizes his name?</p>
<p>Ten years of loneliness, deserted opera houses,</p>
<p>Today, laughter and cheerful words fill the decorated building;</p>
<p>I beg my old man not to age too quickly,</p>
<p>Central Plains is still the land of Han.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Lament for the Slum Dwellers</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Policies must be carried out, and we wholeheartedly support them. The authorities have a pragmatic spirit and wise plans, want to do things, and are willing to do things, and we also admire them very much; and we can even better understand and are willing to offer sympathy and support for all the difficulties and obstacles encountered during the implementation of policies. However, regarding the matter of demolishing slum dwellings, we would like to suggest that it be carried out after getting through this severe winter, in the coming spring, that is, implemented two months later. I wonder if this humble opinion can be heard?</p>
<p>For the safety of four million people, sacrificing forty thousand slum dwellers, even if it is not to such a precise extent, the urban construction has its own overall plan, not to mention that these forty thousand slum dwellers are by no means sacrifices, but are only being asked to move to non-restricted construction areas. Therefore, in principle, we absolutely support it without any doubt.</p>
<p>Why do we want to request a two-month delay in implementation on behalf of them? It is really a matter of humanity. This year, all industries have felt the economic recession, and the lower and middle classes, in particular, feel the economic pressure. Coupled with the extreme cold, the end of the year, demolishing and building, and carrying out large-scale construction will not only increase the financial burden but also make people feel embarrassed in terms of manpower. If you and I were one of these forty thousand households, in these urgent and declining times, what kind of sad shadow would be cast on our mood!</p>
<p>Human touch! We should be able to consider it a little!</p>
<p>Naturally, we are well aware of the authorities' careful handling of this matter, and we also know that the slum dwellers will be able to obey the law and follow the instructions, and there will definitely be no problems. Perhaps we are being a little too emotional, but wouldn't it be more considerate if these slum dwellers could barely manage to get through this severe winter?</p>
<p>It is the kindness of a woman!</p>
<h3>Ten Years Ago Today in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Xiaomai</p>
<p>…Remembering an important day in history…</p>
<p>Ten years ago today, Chairman Chiang suffered the Xi'an Incident. It took thirteen days for him to escape danger and return to Nanjing. Before leaving Shaanxi, Chairman Chiang addressed Zhang and Yang, saying, "This decision of the Xi'an Incident is related to the survival of China's fifty-year history and is also a critical turning point for the survival of the Republic of China." The history of the past ten years has proved that these two "prophetic" remarks were not exaggerated.</p>
<p>When the "Double Twelfth" Incident occurred, the writer was staying in Tokyo. The situation at the time is still vaguely remembered.</p>
<p>According to historical records, the "Double Twelfth Incident" occurred at 5 a.m. before dawn on that day. That morning, the Xi'an Telegraph Bureau had been monitored by the defense forces, so the news could not be transmitted. The first extra edition in Tokyo, I remember, was published before the usual evening paper, which seemed to have been sent from Nanjing. As far as I knew afterward, many of the telegrams from the newspapers at that time and later were censored and deleted by the Japanese authorities, so what was left was too short to be further shortened. After the evening paper at about 5 p.m., there was also an extra edition of a certain newspaper.</p>
<p>Enemies rejoice</p>
<p>From then until "December 25," when Chiang escaped danger and returned to Nanjing, the correspondents of the major Tokyo newspapers in China were ordered by their headquarters to compete in reporting. Even the city's on-site reporters desperately interviewed the external repercussions. At that time, the Chinese Embassy in Japan in Azabu District and Ambassador Xu Shiying were naturally the first targets, but Xu kept his mouth shut, and the reporters gained nothing. As I learned afterward, the information successively received by Japan's "Kasumigaseki" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and "Miyakezaka" (Ministry of the Army) in Tokyo was comparable to that of the embassy!</p>
<p>When the city's on-site reporters had nothing to write and nothing to record, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," which had risen suddenly in Tokyo and was competing with the two major hegemons, "Asahi" and "Mainichi," actually interviewed the dormitories of students studying in Japan. One student studying in Tokyo replied, "We know as much as what is recorded in the newspapers." This sentence (which was a bit like "diplomatic rhetoric" but was indeed the truth) was unexpectedly published on the front page of the city news section and was accompanied by several photos.</p>
<p>From the night of the twelfth, I clearly remember that Tokyo's teahouses, small restaurants, and bathhouses all used this as a topic and as the center of their chats.</p>
<p>The main figures of the Japanese military and government were naturally very "concerned" about the situation at the time. On the night of the thirteenth, I accidentally took a "metered car" for business and passed near the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs! I saw that their lights were still brightly lit, which was different from usual. It was not until I read the newspaper on the morning of the fourth that I realized that the main figures of the Japanese parties had held a long meeting there for four or five hours that evening to discuss the so-called "countermeasures," the primary goal of which was still the same: "to see if they could fish in troubled waters and take advantage of the situation."</p>
<p>The next day, the heads of the Japanese army and navy held a joint meeting and decided on the following two so-called "principles": (1) Take self-defense measures when necessary; (2) Maintain vigilance and observe quietly. Isn't this a "fishing" measure? The foreign minister at the time was Arita, the army minister was Terauchi, and the navy minister was Nagano.</p>
<p>After the incident, the first official contact between Ambassador Xu and the Japanese authorities was the day after Chiang Ting-wen returned to Luoyang from Shaanxi on the eighteenth. This conversation lasted more than fifty minutes. At that time, Foreign Minister Arita shamelessly requested: "I hope to obtain some special news about the Xi'an Incident in a private capacity."</p>
<p>The Japanese ambassador to China at the time was Kawagoe, but on December 5, he had already left Beijing and resided in Shanghai because the Sino-Japanese negotiations had come to an end. It was not until the nineteenth that he returned to Beijing from Shanghai upon the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" instruction. However, whether Kawagoe was in Beijing or Shanghai, Tokyo's information during these thirteen days was equally rapid and detailed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Toihara, the head of the intelligence division, expressed his views frankly: "Japan really should quickly re-examine China."</p>
<p>Disappointed</p>
<p>Despite the beautiful diplomatic rhetoric and the slippery newspaper editorials, the fact that the Japanese warlords at the time wanted to take advantage of the situation, no matter how big or small, is undeniable. I still remember that after the "Double Twelfth" Incident, the Tokyo stock market, cotton cloth trade, and rayon price plummeted, which proves what the Japanese were imagining in their hearts. Wasn't this trying to expand the conflict and cause a major war on the "wishful thinking" calculation?</p>
<p>On the evening of December 25, the Tokyo newspapers also issued extra editions, and many of them included photos of Chiang. That night was originally a night of Christmas celebrations, but on that night, many financial and military magnates were greatly disappointed. Because: What they hoped for had vanished. Only a few people in the stock market gained something.</p>
<p>Many students studying abroad did indeed party wildly that night, and some almost stayed up all night. But it is doubtful whether they were celebrating anything. On that night, how many people knew that the Sino-Japanese War, which would begin seven months later, had already planted the gunpowder fuse and the seeds of victory nine years later?</p>
<h3>Learn from Children!</h3>
<h3>12 and 13</h3>
<p>— Momo</p>
<p>Some people believe that "thirteen" is the most unlucky number because Jesus' Last Supper had exactly thirteen people at the table, including Judas, who killed Jesus.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say: the reason why the "Xi'an Incident" was resolved peacefully that year was that the incident occurred on the "twelfth" rather than the "thirteenth."</p>
<p>But he forgot that the number of days from the occurrence of the incident to the rescue and Chiang's escape was exactly thirteen days, from the twelfth to the twenty-fifth!</p>
<p>Some people also say: on the evening of the eleventh, Shao Yuanchong, Yang Hucheng, Chen Cheng... and other gentlemen ate at a table with thirteen people in Xi'an. Therefore, Shao was killed at dawn on the twelfth.</p>
<p>And Zhang Xueliang "Young Marshal" did not attend the banquet that night. Wasn't he later granted a special pardon?</p>
<p>Shao Yuanchong stayed in room 113 of the "Xijing Guest House" in Xi'an that night. The place of martyrdom was also "thirteen"!</p>
<p>Only Mr. Endner flew to Shaanxi on the thirteenth to mediate, and this "thirteen" was a good omen.</p>
<p>And today, that "guest house" has changed this room stained with historical bloodstains to room 130.</p>
<p>But the Arabic numeral code is still "thirteen," but after "thirteen," there is a "zero," indicating that the evil spirit has been eliminated!</p>
<p>[12], An eventful day</p>
<p>In terms of months, May is the month with the most anniversaries of the year. But in terms of day order, the "twelfth day" of each month seems to be an "eventful day."</p>
<p>Today, the twelfth, is an example. Ten years ago today, on the twelfth, someone caused chaos and almost caused a major disaster.</p>
<p>According to the author's knowledge, the following months also have festivals on the twelfth day:</p>
<p>February 12th, Commemoration of North-South Unification. March 12th, Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death.</p>
<p>April 12th, Anniversary of the Purge of the Kuomintang in 1924.</p>
<p>November 12th, Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth.</p>
<p>December 12th, Anniversary of the Xi'an Incident.</p>
<p>Also, President Chiang escaped from Xi'an and returned to Nanjing on December 25th. This day is both the Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the world-renowned "Christmas." (Ink)</p>
<h3>Women First?</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhong</p>
<p>Our country has always valued men over women. Generally, parents regard their daughters as "other people's" people, and once they are married, they are no longer recognized as their own. Although we can exceptionally see records of valuing women in old books, they are, after all, exceptions. It is gratifying that in recent years, with the rise of the theory of equal rights for men and women, society has begun to look at women with new eyes and regard them differently. Especially in cities, women are the most glamorous. Snobbish parents value daughters even more, as daughters are their money-making trees, and sons are the ones who are unpromising!</p>
<p>In Shanghai's "upper class" society, where Chinese and foreigners mix, we often hear the slogan "Women First"—Ladies First—which is even translated into both Chinese and English. Is it an international saying? Therefore, many people believe in it: smoking must be permitted by women, men must take off their hats when they see women, and women are given priority when getting on and off vehicles, entering and exiting rooms. Even in some universities, female students are first, sitting in the first row in the lecture hall, which has become an unchangeable habit.</p>
<p>National Assembly representatives are not selected based on age, with separate old and young representatives, but there are women representatives as a separate entity. Is it possible that women are not qualified to be social elites and party representatives...? Is it possible that women representatives are only representing because they are women themselves? It seems that this is also influenced by "Women First." Is "Women First" an insult to women or respect for women?</p>
<p>The "Women First" trend comes entirely from Europe and America. We Chinese are just "copying" it without knowing that "Women First" is a contradiction in Europe and America.</p>
<p>Let's take English as an example: Except for the phrase "Ladies and Gentlemen" during speeches, where women come first, if you write a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Wang, they always write Mr. and Mrs. Wang and not Mrs. and Mr. Wang, with women coming second. This is one example. In articles, especially Americans often like to use "He or She" or "His or Her," always putting men first and women second. This is the second example. As for the word "humanity" in English, it is "Mankind" rather than "Womankind," which shows that men are sufficient to represent humans, while women are not. Calling "people" "Human Being" rather than "Huwoman Being" is also the same situation. Language is the main characteristic representing a nation and a country. In the UK and the US (the birthplace of "Women First"), there are still so many contradictions; how can we discuss others?</p>
<h3>Highly Optimistic</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>A: "I heard that if the next world war breaks out, the war will be decided by bacteriological weapons that are more deadly than atomic bombs!"</p>
<p>B: "Oh! Lucky! After the next world war, China will definitely be a strong country in name and in fact!"</p>
<p>A: "How do you know?"</p>
<p>B: "Isn't it? China has plenty of bacteria!"</p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<p>— Guohong</p>
<p>One day, a young and vigorous youth suddenly developed a strange disease. His left hand hit his right hand, and his right hand hit his left hand, beating them until the skin was torn and the flesh was open, but he still beat them with more and more energy. Others shook their heads, confused.</p>
<h3>Milk and Biscuits—Blessedness Too Thin to Endure</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>National Assembly representatives transferred relief funds to Nanjing refugees, and the relief items included "milk" and "biscuits."</p>
<p>But it is strange that the refugees do not care about "milk and biscuits" but request "pancakes and fried dough sticks"—Is it possible that milk and biscuits are not as "nutritious" as pancakes and fried dough sticks? It is also a bit doubtful!</p>
<p>Logically, hunger makes one indiscriminate in food selection. There is no reason not to want biscuits but want pancakes. I guess the problem is whether they are filling or not. Although milk and biscuits have lovely names, the amount each person receives may not be more substantial than two pancakes and two fried dough sticks!</p>
<h3>Crying for a Blanket</h3>
<p>— Meng Xian</p>
<p>"Where has the blanket gone? The old days are still filled with west winds." This has become the sigh of most public school personnel. But public school personnel would rather have tear-filled eyes and still hope that the blanket will return.</p>
<h3>Woolen Blanket Sobbing and Crying for Injustice</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Please investigate the truth thoroughly</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the public school personnel's wanted woolen blanket, which was announced in the previous issue of this journal, it is actually a case of injustice that cannot be redressed, and the distress cannot be expressed; the wanted warrant has been issued, and the fear is like what! Therefore, I have no choice but to express the following to the public school personnel for defense. I hope you will take a look at it so that the unjust case can be clarified—investigate the truth thoroughly and clarify where the responsibility lies!</p>
<p>The woolen blanket has a contract of sale, and the price is based on evidence; it was originally expected to be a lifelong companion for public school personnel, growing old together, to show warmth—but the original intermediary, the material supply agency, had malicious intentions, changed its mind halfway, slightly improved the appearance of the woolen blanket, and sold it to Pingkang at a high price; it was not voluntary, but forced! The body could not be the master, and it contained this injustice! I have never dared to violate faith and produce two hearts! It was actually the original intermediary who played tricks and profited from it!</p>
<p>Now that the woolen blanket has lost its body to others and the white jade has been tarnished! Public opinion is terrible, and I am extremely willing to jump out of the fire pit! I have repeatedly negotiated with the original intermediary, sincerely hoping to be a good wife (public school personnel), but the cunning intermediary is making trouble and is even using high prices to lure and threaten me to redeem myself! With the woolen blanket's weak and frail appearance, I do not dare to compete; I can only contain my grievances and weep, who will pity me? If the public school personnel and others miss the warmth and affection of the woolen blanket, they may sue the cunning intermediary for being disloyal, deceiving, and abducting the woolen blanket into Pingkang! Once there is a day for public trial, the woolen blanket will testify in court, so as to punish the cunning and vent the public's anger. I implore you to thoroughly investigate the case, as I am truly suffering!</p>
<p>American Blanket, respectfully</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 18</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiajin</p>
<p>True and False Travelers</p>
<p>The local beggar gangs in Shanghai, although trying hard to survive and penetrating everywhere, are still unkempt and haggard year after year. This is not the ambition of a man. Therefore, the general young and strong members decided to find another way, truly fulfilling their "a man's ambition lies in all directions" nature. These beggar streams, holding lofty aspirations, actually went far away and began their traveling career. This is the new route called "flying kites" in the beggar gang. However, this kind of livelihood still does not get rid of fraudulent methods. "Flying kites" means taking a boat or vehicle. Shanghai has convenient transportation, and its land and water routes are as dense as a spider web. The beggar gang can take advantage of the times and travel to various places frequently without spending a penny. Moreover, every time they go out, they are sure to "grab a hand" (beg for money). Without the true ability to be on your own, how can you start a family from scratch?</p>
<p>Performance on the Boat</p>
<p>These people pretend to be travelers on the boat every day, and their clothes are quite neat, not revealing their beggar nature. When all the passengers are on board and the boat sets sail, they begin their crying and laughing skills. First, they greet the passengers next to them and ask about their affairs, and then gradually talk about their own affairs, and then they invent their past identity, such as originally being a merchant in their hometown, but unexpectedly encountered disaster, their store went bankrupt, their wife died, and their children were scattered. It seems that all the suffering of life has gathered on them. Then they ask the passengers on the boat, and they all gather around to ask questions, listening respectfully to his speech. Chinese people have always been thick-skinned and good-natured, especially when traveling, they have plenty of leisure time and like to meddle in other people's affairs. Everyone meets by chance and feels particularly close. Soon, it spreads from ten to one hundred, and everyone can't help but feel compassion. The beggar believes that the good opportunity must not be missed, and asks the public for donations. At this time, everyone will generously donate money. In a moment, the collected amount is already considerable. When the ticket inspector comes and finds that there is no ticket, the passengers will intercede for him and give him preferential treatment. Therefore, the beggar not only rides the boat for free but also returns fully loaded. The next day, he takes another boat back to Shanghai, and can repeat the tragedy again in the same way. After a long time, the crew will inevitably see through his tricks, so he has to bribe them to silence them. Sometimes, he even needs to distribute some of the proceeds to keep things quiet. But in any case, as long as he travels a few times a month, the total income is far better than that of his peers on the streets.</p>
<p>This kind of "flying kites" farce is most common on the ships traveling along the Yangtze River. The second most common is on the sea ships traveling to Ningbo and Shaoxing. Originally, the Shanghai Ningbo Shaoxing Association had regulations that poor fellow villagers stranded in Shanghai could be given a free boat ticket back home by the association. The beggar pretends to be a fellow villager, but his goal is not the boat ticket but to get a letter of introduction. The letter states that he can receive two yuan from a certain place after returning to his hometown (the situation before the war). And on the boat, he can rely on a wonderful performance to get a lot of profit. It is conceivable that the association's preferential treatment has instead created a slippery business for the beggar.</p>
<p>Station drama</p>
<p>In addition to the waterway "sea mountain" (ship), they also operate in the military station. People in the gang call the train "flying centipede." But on the train, they cannot ask for help from the passengers because the feelings of the passengers are very weak, not as close as the passengers on the boat who "share the same boat." Moreover, even a fourth-class ticket cannot be avoided. They have to get off the train at their destination, and then start their crying and laughing performance when the passengers are crowded and getting off the train, asking the passengers for assistance. Several passenger cars arrive and leave a station every day. The passengers are also constantly coming, and the beggar can operate in station A one day, and then take a car to station B the next day. Although they are exhausted from traveling and working hard, the income is quite considerable. This is the new route of the "flying kites" gang out of the dock.</p>
<h3>If I Were to Establish a Party</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>If I were to establish a party, first, I would certainly choose the best name: "Equality, Freedom, and Democracy Party." Perhaps some may think this name is too long, but because it must fit practical needs, it must be so.</p>
<p>Then, I must issue a declaration, stating that this party grew up among the people, therefore, we can certainly represent the true will of the people. The party's policies are based on "Equality, Freedom, and Democracy," so it must consider the people in all things. This declaration need not be long, but the words "the people" must be said as many times as possible.</p>
<p>As long as there are a few "cadres," then I would certainly claim that the party members are spread all over China, with an astonishingly large number—shocking, like saying the party already has 200,000,001 members. This way, it can be proven that the party represents the "majority" of the "will of the people."</p>
<p>With such a large number of party members, of course, some things should be done, because the party's purpose is "everything for the people"!</p>
<p>Therefore, I would request the government to appoint our party members to positions in the National Government organization. The president of the Executive Yuan is needed, the president of the Legislative Yuan is needed, and the director of a certain Ministry of Administration is also needed! The more, the better. When writing articles, then one should borrow a phrase: "Willing to be a dog and horse official."</p>
<p>If the government agrees, then we will talk about being officials later; (This party has a spirit of enterprise!) If it cannot be entirely satisfactory, then this is because the government is not democratic, we can organize ourselves.</p>
<p>My party will certainly soar, party members will certainly have official positions, and, "everything for the people"! Is there any party member "unsuitable"?</p>
<h3>Talking About Xi'an on Double Twelve</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The Xi'an dialect has many dialectal components, which sounds quite interesting to outsiders. People in Xi'an call "what place" "yi ya da" (　　), like the trademark of a certain shirt in Shanghai. Also, Xi'an calls "there" "wu da" (ua), which is like the pronunciation of the Japanese surname "Uda." Other examples such as calling "head" "duo la" or "sha," are also very interesting.</p>
<p>The word "I" in Chang'an commonly has three pronunciations. One is "wu" (兀), like the Cantonese word for "I"; the second is "ngai" (兀), as far as the author knows, the Pearl River Delta also has this pronunciation. The third is "× ya" (wa), which is completely the same as the pronunciation of "ware" (吾) in ancient Japanese when referring to oneself. These three pronunciations have considerable value in phonological research.</p>
<p>A certain Western medicine store in Xi'an has the telephone number "606," and its branch has the number "914."</p>
<p>There is a movie theater in Xi'an called "E-pang Palace," and someone asked the owner, why not show the film "Burning of the E-pang Palace"?</p>
<p>In late autumn and early winter in Xi'an, there is a cheap and delicious snack called "persimmon cake," which is made by mashing ripe red persimmons, mixing them with flour, and then frying them in hot oil until fragrant. The taste is delicious, not inferior to Western "shortbread" or Cantonese "steamed sponge cake."</p>
<p>A week ago, the author saw an old countryman on the street, his nose painted red, wearing a sheepskin coat inside out, with the white wool exposed. He was riding backwards on a donkey, with his back facing the donkey's head and his face facing the donkey's rear end. What was most laughable was that he also hung a chamber pot (of course, brand new!) on his shoulder with a red thread. Before the procession, there were several people playing music and carrying offerings such as tea, fruit, and pastries for the gods. It was said to be the custom of an old man presenting offerings for the birth of his first child. But whether this old man was following Xi'an customs or transplanted from another village, it has not been investigated, and I dare not make a reckless judgment.</p>
<p>In Xi'an, at wedding celebrations, various kinds of pranks, more than half of them involve half-forced, half-willingly making the newly married couple kiss in public. It can be known that "rouge" is not imported.</p>
<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber" describes the customs and objects of Western Capital, and many of the place names and temple names mentioned in it still exist today. For example, the wealthy store opened by Granny Liu's (實玉嫂) maternal relatives, Wang Xifeng's (王鳳姐) family, is repeatedly mentioned in the book as being on "West Street" next to the "Drum Tower." This building and street name still exist, and it is one of the crossroads in the city center, but the "Drum Tower" has not had a drum for a long time. There is only a huge plaque on the top floor, inscribed with the words "Sound Heard in Heaven." Since the Anti-Japanese War, a simulated air raid alarm has been installed on the top floor, a coincidence.</p>
<p>The lowest-grade brothel district in Xi'an, "Duck Pit," is just like calling prostitutes "wild chickens" elsewhere, or Cantonese people calling them "cat holes." The idea that prostitutes are not human but domestic fowl is the same. A certain gentleman wrote "Ode to Duck Pit," and here are a few lines excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"...</p>
<p>There are no ducks and no eggs in the pit,</p>
<p>The pit is full of pitiful people.</p>
<p>Ducks are better than people.</p>
<p>Ducks float on green water in the pond,</p>
<p>In Duck Pit, bodies are scorched by fire.</p>
<p>Ducks eat fish and shrimp, but don't eat ducks,</p>
<p>Only humans eat humans in this world!</p>
<p>..."</p>
