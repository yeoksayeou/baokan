<h3>東北問題在渝協商　馬歇爾約周恩來晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿一日電〕馬歇爾將軍返渝二日，曾與蔣主席二次會談，並與宋子文院長談判中美貸款問題，此外，無任何政治之交往。際此東北軍事衝突日益擴大之時，馬帥態度之沉靜，各方極爲注意，惟渠本日在怡園舉行茶會，邀請政府及各黨派代表參加，此係馬氏返渝後首次與中國各在野黨派方面人士之集會，將交換當前中國軍事政治諸問題之意見。馬氏除赴宴接見賓客外，其餘時間與吉倫將軍研究軍事三人小組代表赴東北調査之報告。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿一日電〕馬歇爾將軍刻已與周恩來將軍約定，於廿二日上午十時，舉行返華後初次會談。共黨私人方面承認，彼等對馬氏拒不急切置身於極端決定性之談判中一點，感覺驚奇。馬歇爾在老鷹岩之蔣主席官邸中安度週末，今晚曾與宋院長同進晚餐，明日將參加美駐華代辦之雞尾酒會。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿一日電〕美大使館代辦史邁斯，為介紹馬歇爾特使夫婦與陪都各界人士晤面，本日下午五時至七時，在嘉陵新村四號舉行雞尾酒會，柬請陪都各界人士參加。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕北平軍事調處執行部現正等候重慶方面三人小組訓令，馬歇爾等方在重慶會商覓取解決東北糾紛辦法。預料數日內三人小組將有訓令到平，使現在東北之執行小組採取行動。執行小組任務闡明後，將有更多小組派往東北，軍調部似不致於蘇軍自哈爾濱及齊齊哈爾撤退後立即派遣小組前往。</p>
<h3>國軍逼近公主嶺　共黨稱美機曾掃射四平街　軍委會發言人指明係揑造</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕傳國軍先頭部隊已逼近公主嶺，共軍已於該處集結五六萬人，準備激戰，杜諆明將軍定廿五日親至前方巡視。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕重慶訊：哈爾濱情勢突呈緊張，共軍待蘇軍撤退後，將立即進佔哈市，就形勢而乎論，國軍僅佔有點綫，共軍則從事面的發展，由瀋陽開往長春之國軍、現又遭遇困難，四平街之新一軍，亦正爲共軍威脅，因哈市之政府接收官員並無兵力，其若干人員業已離哈飛往瀋陽，政府可能放棄哈市。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社瀋陽廿日電〕負責方面報吿，哈爾濱實際在中共控制之下，是以廿五日蘇軍自該城撤退時，留居該處少數政府官員之安全，自屬可慮。楊市長爲留守崗位官員之一，準備自蘇軍手中，接收哈爾濱，並於廿一日主持餞別蘇軍之宴會。但一般人預料，哈爾濱之命運，將與長春相同，　俟蘇軍撤退，中共即將樹立其政權。昨有政府飛機一架，飛越長春上空，報吿該城交通幾已恢復常態。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕蘇軍撤離哈爾濱日期，詎今只有五日，近郊情形，頗爲緊張。中共方面消息謂，國軍一千五百人，自長春向公主嶺方面退却，正在追擊中。美記者五人曁陸軍武官列格斯傳均安然無恙。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿一日電〕共產黨之反美宣傳日趨激烈，今日復指責美機於十七十九兩日在四平街一帶攻擊共軍，十九日有飛機一架被擊落，其中有「美國兵一名「。大多數觀察家認爲，此項消息不確，因美國飛行員已奉命在共產軍區域內必須極端審愼將事，自瀋陽出發之每週飛行，業予禁止。政府發言人認爲，此項消息乃屬故意揑造。渠稱並無美國飛機進入此一地帶，美國人亦從不駕駛中國飛機，馬歇爾之代表吉倫中將透露，執行總部並未接到共產黨對於空中活動有何反對表示，但吉倫已請美空軍司令部報吿上週內美方活動，以及是否有飛機一架失踪。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿一日電〕此間美軍總部，對中共辦事處發言人稱，美機掃射四平街說，在事實未經調査前，不擬加以否認。據稱：美國飛機除載列格斯少校赴長春之一架外，並無其他美機飛往該區。中共方面自馬歇爾特使返華後，即開始對美國大肄抨擊，如（一）對國軍開赴東北，美方予以種種協助，表示反對。（二）反對以租借法案獲得物資及美軍剩餘武器，充實國軍力量。（三）仗對美軍協助訓練中國空軍，尤其反對訓練轟炸機隊此外，中共對美國及其他聯合國家在財政上援助政府，亦表反對。據稱：在此時貸款與中國，其結果僅爲維持一反動的獨裁政府，馬歇爾特使在林園度週末後，將與中國各方進行商談，惟三人小組正式舉行會議日期尙米決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿一日電〕軍委會發言人廿一日發表談話稱：中共機關報重慶新華日報本日刋載美機掃射四平街之消息，純係揑造，査東北方面，根本無美軍空軍，該報竟妄稱美機掃射四平街，並稱會有飛機一架被擊落，完全係有意造謠，淆亂聽聞。</p>
<h3>中共在東九省　設鐵路管理局</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕中共已在東九省東部自行成立東滿鐵路管理局，下設梅河口·通化·吉林·拉法·朝陽川五個分局，管轄吉瀋（撫順至吉林），梅輯（梅河口至輯安），四梅（四平街至梅河口），長圖（長春至圖們江），拉哈（拉法至哈爾濱），圖牡（圖們至牡丹江）等各幹綫，據共方宣稱：現除五常至哈爾濱，圖們至牡丹江尙未通車及撫順淸源，長春吉林兩段又吿停車外，其餘已有三千里完全通車。</p>
<h3>太原派出聯絡小組　赴平遙等縣調處　同蒲鐵路北段出遭破壞</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原廿一日電〕軍調部太原中心小組派赴平遙等縣之聯絡小組政府代表胡向離，中共代表張希欽曁隨員一行，廿一日晨九時搭車南下，將先赴平遙，繼赴介休·汾陽·孝義·靈石等縣進行調處。又候馬小組決定前往聞喜，視察被圍情况，並就地商討補給物資辦法。</p>

<h3>綏包解圍記</h3>
<p>— 特約記者　永子</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州航訊〕去秋日本投降後，第十二戰區司令長官傳作義將軍（見圖），以極敏捷的行動，在一個星期內，即由苦戰八年的緩西後套，進兵到歸綏，包頭，因爲士兵訓練有素，動作神速，不久便佔領綏遠全省各縣。同時馬副長官占山奉命率部由陝北哈拉塞挺進十一戰區轄境的熟河，鄧副長官寶　，也由坐鎭八年的楡林到了歸綏，請示機宜。</p>
<p>雙十國慶日，綏遠全省民衆熱烈慶祝抗戰勝利後的第一度佳節，兼爲　將軍收復綏土祝賀。不幸得很，就在這一度狂歡之後，惡劣的消息，紛紛傳來，接着綏省各地相繼吿警，馬占山率部至大同，前進受阻，綏　豐鎭凉城等縣，也有了接觸，十月十六日起，大戰序幕揭開了，共軍在攻，國軍在守，塞上的烽火，頓時衝破了每個人歡欣鼓舞的情緒。</p>
<p>共軍由晋北及察哈爾調來的部隊，越集越多，且係精銳，包括賀龍，蕭克，聶榮臻等部，人數约共二十萬·十二戰區的舒隊，迫不得已，先讓出了幾個縣城，退至綏東重鎭的集寗後，傅長官一面呼籲國人，制止內戰，一面却也準備萬一，作戰略上的部署，結果共軍攻勢益猛，集寗也退了出來，歸綏和包頭終於被圍了。</p>
<p>兩佩多月的綏遠戰役中，綏包兩名城，整整被圍了五十八天，共軍圍城很急速，鄧寳山將軍本要返回楡林，已來不及走出城去，只好協同傳長官死守歸綏城垣了。負責守包頭者爲董其武將軍，另外还有途徑包頭赴察哈爾的馮欽哉主席。中共軍攻城，由賀龍親自指揮，攻歸綏不下，又攻包頭，兩城俱有激烈的爭奪戰，據說歸綏舊城西郊緊急時，傅長官親至火線，振臂督戰，並厲聲喊吿將士曰：「我是傅長官，快往前衝！」以致將共軍打得潰不成軍，從此共軍乃重整旗鼓，移注目標於包頭，再作圍攻，亦吿失敗，而且賀龍本人在包頭城郊負了重傷。</p>
<p>傅長官於綏包解圍後，偕鄧副長官取道北平飛渝出席二中全會，他們歸途經過蘭州，記者都拜見過了。傳長官對於這次綏遠戰役的勝利，並不認爲是光榮，相反的他的內心却感到非常難過，他不願再有內戰發生，但他希望國人明察是非，究竟是誰在打誰。鄧副長官在北平看見了賀龍，曾笑語賀云：「在圍城時，天氣那麼冷，我們很想請您老兄進城吃一頓莜麫（「莜麫」是綏省的特產），您們總是打得不停」，賀龍聽了却無言應答。（四月十一日）</p>
<h3>調處執行部　成立整軍處</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿廿一電〕軍事調處執行部整軍處已成立，政府，美方已派定人員。</p>
<h3>陳逆公博神態沮喪　其妻在獄撰狀聲辯　遣陳子到蘇遞呈請求覆判</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿一日電〕陳述公博經蘇高法院判處死刑後，其妻李麗莊在京獄中聞悉，不服判決，乃在獄中代撰申請覆判呈文，令子陳甘來蘇，於廿日下午五時向高院呈遞轉呈最高法院。記者獲得此訊後，特於今日至道前街吳中飯店三號探訪，措悉陳甘化名陳林，曾於廿一日晨九時赴看守所探視其父，並將底稿呈閱，陳逆神態甚爲沮喪，悽然語其子日：「我死期已不遠，不必多此一舉。」陳甘聞言，淚流雙頰，經法警阻止後，始退出。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州特派記者廿一日電〕陳逆公博於受審及判決之日，曾一再聲稱不欲上訴，但前日蘇州高院突接到陳妻李麗莊在首都獄中代陳所撰之聲請覆判狀，頗出一般人意外。按該狀係陳逆之子陳甘送由高院轉呈最高法院者，文長三千餘字，其不服高院判決之理由，約分四點：（一）本案僅經六小時之審判，即宣吿辯論終結，關於本案重要關鍵及有利於被吿之證據，未能盡量調査。狀中披露，陳逆於廿九年起，即曾化名「周進」，與軍統局發生關係，表示擁護蔣主席，並秘密爲中央工作，有負責聯絡之軍統局同志徐天深，陳中平可以證明，軍統局並曾屢次密電，囑其掩護地下工作人員，保護電台，報吿汪逆與敵所訂密約內容及交涉經過，對防共事亦有所指示，該局均有案可稽。「可知被吿對國家民族之效忠，擁護主席之誠意，以及保全東南三省，促成國家統一之種種措施，爲功不可沒。」（二）公設辯護人於開審前，從未接見被吿，對案情旣不明瞭，對有利被吿之事實及證物證人，無法知悉，因之未能充分辯護，形同虛設，「法律上所賦予被吿應得之利益，悉被剝奪，尙何公平審判之可言。」（三）被告保護軍統局電台，保釋中央工作人員，軍事方面除與戴局長取得合作外，並與顧祝同何柱國等聯絡，足見並無反抗政府之意，而實係忍辱爲國，保全東南數省，奉行中央命令，「縱不敢據以爲功，實亦應援以酌量減刑。」（四）被吿離渝後，即親函蔣主席，申訴苦衷及以後補救方案，可以認爲自首之表示。二十九年後與軍統局聯絡後，往來審報甚多，更合自首條例，其後布置防共，策應反攻，保持京滬精華，程度更在自首之上，原審法庭不援引自首條例，以減刑或免刑，而竟判處以死刑，尤不甘服云云。又蘇州大華報日來竟發表同情陳逆謬論，今日此間他報已予痛駁。</p>
<h3>首都高院將裝電器　審奸情形播送各地</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>再為中國工業呼籲！</h3>
<p>本報社論，指出中國工業前途的危機，已非一次，證以近來上海工業界的情勢，我們更以爲應趕快補救，否則工業豈但艱困，簡直將自趨絕路。只要看那絢爛一時的紡織業，近來布廠染廠已經無利可圖，紗廠也漸感厚利不會長久，司見其他本來鐮錢不多的工業勢將更無立足之地，工業險象一天一天的顯著，誰也不能否認的了。工廠如逼到新開的絕無僅有，而停閉者紛紛擾擾，那末其時工人將不是要求增加工資，而變爲要求發救濟金，工人的呼聲也將不是罷工而是復工。我們試閉目設想，眼前彷彿有一片圖畫就要湧現出來：無數烟突不冒烟的工廠，一羣嗷嗷待哺的工人！</p>
<p>中國的工業何以今天弄到這般景象？原因複雜，各方面都有責任，而當局的責任尤大。</p>
<p>第一，政局不安定，交通不恢復，以致貨流不暢，物價　貴，這是最大的惡因。這惡因是誰種的？無疑的是中國共產黨　八個月來，中外人士都希望中國內部的政兼用政治方法解決。人民如此期待，政府也如此努力，友邦更如此協助。然而停戰協定雖訂，各地共軍的襲擊始終並未全停。甚至東北原不在軍事調處之列，應由國民政府派軍接收主權的，中共偏要調動大兵，利用蘇軍延期撤退的機會，發動大規模的戰事。而各地修路復礦的工作，也都爲了中共的背約阻擾，遲遲未見實現。煤產依然不旺，貨運依然不暢，這樣情况，更加以軍事緊張，人心浮動，於是正在步跌的物價又因刺激而復趨回漲。物價　漲之勢旣未遏止，工人增資的要求自將永無已時，工廠亦必終有逼到走頭無路只好停業的一天。</p>
<p>第二，平定物價，政府未嘗不努力，可是鷄零狗碎，沒有全盤計劃，縱有計劃也未必堅決貫澈，以致物價始終在大漲小回和小回大漲的循環中，繼長增高。近對工業實在是致命傷，而一般恃薪工爲生的工人尤其要談「價」色變。各種物價，在四月上旬原有一般下瀉之勢，但所惜恰巧在這時候，公用事　反有飛狂漲價的運動！上海電費旣奉准增收「煤斤附加費」，自來水也奉准每立方公尺收一百二十元（附加費二十元在外），電車公共汽車等聞不日也將加的百分之二百，電話火車或將接踵加價。我們也知道這些事業入不敷出，長此虧負，勢難爲繼，但我們不懂：如電力公司等爲什麼先要大加薪工，增加支出？我們更不懂：爲什這這些公用事業偏要和他種物價作輪流漲價的循環競賽？尤其不懂：爲什麽政府不能從大處遠處着想，暫時在物價趨降的期間，採用對公用事業忍痛補貼的政策，以免他們紛紛漲價，再來刺激其他物價的重復回漲？勝利初期因路局郵局偏偏漲價觸動商店競相漲價的瘋狂狀態，現在又來重演，何等可惜！須知此種公用事業漲價所收入者不大，政府所省補貼費為數也究屬有限，而因准許他們漲價，直接間接刺激一般物價之重漲，使四月份五月份的生活費指數本可希望不高者因此或不下降，或甚至仍趨增高，從而使政府開支更增，赤字更大，更從而使工人受生活壓迫愈重，提出要求愈高，一般工業也愈覺無法經營，祇有相率歇業，國家與社會所受的損害，將不可以數字計。爲政須識大體，尤須懂得打大算盤，然後憑其高瞻遠矚之所得，可以為整個社會策劃最有利的方案。否則如只知斤斤計較小處的利害損益，以爲這裏多一筆收入，那裏少一宗開支，即以衋責自慰，殊不知貪小失大，正是這種政策的結果。過去努力平定物價安息工潮的些微收穫，也勢將為些種近視淺見的政策所摧毀而無遺！</p>
<p>第三，投機商人掀風作浪，政府彷彿不大有認眞徵辦幾個，因此物價往往有不合理的上漲。例如本市米價在近半月來原已回跌，大致在二萬五六千元，不料鉅額米糧貸款方經核准，米價不平反漲！，產地固奇貨可居，商人又投機抬價。市面上多了這批大款，就近搜購，更刺激了米商漁利的私慾，於是不合理的米糧漲價，居然出現。我們早看出：中國目前缺糧，應該從外洋輸入糧食。這一點，無論如何必須向國際力爭。若但知貸放鉅款，在內地產區或竟在本市河下爭購食米，豈但不會平低米價，或反因產地漲價而刺激本市糧價。但是，蔣署長廷敝雖在美國聲嘶力竭的呼籲，要求接濟我國糧食，而聯總和英美加聯合糧委會却一再削減，英國且力阻暹羅餘糧的運華接濟。我們以同盟大國之一，在勝利後却落得如此國際地位，糧食只有儘在本國內地互相爭購，却從來沒見社會有力人士對友邦說過一句話，本來貸款買糧是德政，是好意，却因只在內地買米，反為商人躉戶另開發財之門，反爲小民增加束肚挨餓的痛苦，政府如果再熟視無睹，束手無策，豈非天大笑話？「民以食為天」。尤其是工人階層，食稀消耗最大，米價漲勢不平，消費指數就不會低，工潮也就不會平息，工業也就不會安定繁榮。</p>
<p>第四，我們須得提及勞工紀律問題。工人與工廠，是唇齒相依，不能視同敵對。中國現况，尤須勞資合作，方可渡過難關，復興中國的工業，奠立中國工業化的始基。但現在如絲織業工人的長期罷工，尤其如源通廠工人的兇毆廠主職員等等行爲，以及廠外工人甚至閒雜流氓非法侵入工廠·肆意搗亂·實在不僅違反了勞工應守的紀律，而且已涉及擾亂社會秩序的範兩。政府有安定社會保障企業的責任，對此種事，斷不能官樣文章，一紙了事。如果認眞要扶植工業，維護治安，則政府對於工人合法合理的要求間常予以扶助，而對於工人的非法行爲，絕不能再事徇情姑息。應助者助，應徵者懲，這纔有紀律可言，有事業可辦。或者疑爲如此未免不見諒於工人，其實，眞正明理安分的工人，並不願意毀壞中國脆弱的工業萌芽，以自掘其墳墓。除去若干「害羣之馬」，芷所以保障善良工人的安居樂業。救工廠，也就是救工人！</p>
<p>最後，我們願不避忌諱的談一談勞工運動。國民黨扶助勞工，這是合時的政策。國民黨應該有專責的人從事工運，尤爲無可置疑，更就工人本身言，應該在政府許可之下，依法組織工會，此在廠主也當深明大義，不可妄加阻止。不過我們須指出，工運的目的在為勞工謀福利。謀俱正的福利，而決不可存心用不合埋的要求，誘致工人的盲從，終至使他們自趨絕路而尙一無所知。再者，工運必須走上正軌，萬不可以工運爲各找民衆的手段，而黨團政軍之間，對此複雜的工運問題允宜密切配合，政策統一。否則政出多門，號令不一，反授蓄意破壞居心搗亂之徒以可乘之隙，這裏放一把「火」，那邊開一個「閘」，必將鬧得整個工業界「如水益深，如火益烈」，皇皇不可終日，大家沒有一天好睡，而工入們眞恃勞力謀生者也終有一天大家愁眉苦臉，喊着失業。</p>
<p>總之：中國目前的工業界，外受「匯價低，洋貨廉」的壓迫，其製成品已感勢難競爭，更加以內受「政治不安，交通不復，物價不平，工潮不息」的影響，幾有「維持乏術，停閉無法」的痛苦！只要遇到工業界人士，什之八九，都在皺眉嘆氣，走頭無路，決非少數人的危言聳聽。至於一般純正善良的工人，他們也何嘗不知道中國工業的脆弱，目前工人待遇實已相當優厚。然而究竟理智少，情感多，難　　因少數淺見自私者的煽惑，動輒怠工罷工，甚至仗勢勒索，兇毆廠主，造成工作效率一般低落，勞工紀律普遍廢弛的險象。這樣下去，我們如再噤若寒蟬，不爲中國工業前途指出危機，一任胡鬧，名爲「勞工神聖」，而結果實無異掘了陷阱，使工人隊下深淵，將來悔之已晚。聽說美國要設法使日本紗廠恢復六百萬錠子的生產能力，而大批日俘日僑回國，將來短期間日本工業回復生機，中國更必失此良機！我們必須再爲中國工業呼籲，也就是爲中國與正純良的工人呼籲，請求政府速有正當的決策，督策勞資雙方竭誠協調，尤其要使產業界在有法律有秩序有理智有情感的社會裘繁榮滋長起來。倘不此之圖，而仍惟挑撥惡感，煽動工潮是務，以爲這纔可算扶助勞工，那末南轅北轍，終必失敗，而阻止中國工業化的也就是這些人物！</p>

<h3>外長會議暗雲已佈　蘇表示強硬態度　謂世界組織無蘇參加不能獲決定　英美認與蘇有破臉可能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十日電〕莫斯科電台今日直率宣稱：有關戰後組織之重要問題，如無蘇聯參加或參加而反對，則不能有所決定。此一蘇聯官方電台在檢討蘇聯在東歐之目標與成就時，承認自芬蘭至巴爾幹正在建立一堅强之經濟政治集團，由蘇聯領導。評論員奧爾洛夫指出蘇聯與芬闌·波蘭·捷克斯洛伐克·匈牙利·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞及南斯拉夫日趨密切之關係。渠稱：此等國家承認戰爭已使大國間之關係發生激烈變化，蘇聯已成爲國際政治之一大因素，影饗全世界之動態。論及蘇聯最近決定對前敵國之停戰條件予以放寬一事時，奧爾洛夫謂：此等國家發覺履行對蘇義務深爲困難，蘇聯政府凖備採取折衷辦法。奧氏並稱：許多國家認爲與蘇聯增强政治經濟關係乃增强其國際地位之最好機會。渠折出蘇聯與鄰近國家之貿易關係，係根據「權利均等基礎」，對於第三者並無任何限制。但渠力陳蘇聯不能容忍在貿易名義之下實行政治干涉。蘇聯評論家此項言論發生於巴黎四强外長會議開會五日之前，預示苏外長莫洛托夫在此次重要會議中可能採取之路綫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕四强外長會議，下星期将在巴黎舉行，該會對於歐洲問題一致和平解決之希望，將吿成功乎？抑將失敗乎？此間外交界魚責人士對之頗表隱憂。同時益感此次會議對促成四强合作締結對義大利·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞及匈牙利和平條约之最後努力。例如美國國務卿貝爾納斯向參議院外交委員會提出之報吿，謂若干國家若不贊同對義大利和平條约，則美國或將單獨草擬條約。英美兩國承認，各該國在巴黎會議中極有與蘇聯破臉之可能。會義如欲成就，須視蘇聯準備讓步之程度。英美兩國均聲明各該國意欲堅持旣定政策，現無跡象證明蘇聯將退步，故草擬歐洲和平條約而停頓八月之僵局，並無打開之望。</p>

<h3>美國民主共和兩黨　究竟有何區別？　右翼民主黨逐漸近似共和黨　左翼共和黨則又近似民主黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕美國之民主黨與共和黨究竟有何區別？此乃外國人素所疑惑不解之問題。時至今日，美本國人民竟已逐漸感覺區別爲難，今距議院選舉之期，僅有七個月，美國人民雖自以爲能區別何者爲民主黨，何者爲共和黨，然同時亦不否認右翼之民主黨，其思想與行動，已逐漸近似共和黨，而左翼之共和黨，則又逐漸近似民主黨。一般認爲此種現象，足以預示共和黨將形成一直正之保守黨，而民主黨則將變爲一眞正之目由黨。同時，工聯領袖及左翼知識份子，則將設立一左派第三黨，常然此等演變，猶須經過數年之久，始能各樹顯明之旗幟。猶憶羅斯福故總統於一九三八年在南部諸州作巡迥演講時，曾囑投票者勿得選舉右翼之民主黨議員，應令彼等參加共和黨之陣容。人民對於此項呼籲，雖未運從，然繼續執行羅斯福「新政」之人，仍一貫此等政策。現任商務部長垂萊斯主張由杜魯門總統，兩院民主黨領袖，及民主黨全國委員會合組特種委員會，有權對投票反對政府或其重要施策之民主黨員，開除其黨籍。南部諸州之右翼民主黨議員，對於此項建議，已表示嚴重之抗議。杜魯門總統尙未公然表示支持此項建議，然渠於傑克遜節之演說中，曾謂：「余不能過於堅決支持黨內統一之說」。總統雖欲從事黨內之改革，然以選舉期近，渠又不欲喪失大部份之民主黨員，而减少本黨之實力。再就共和黨內部言：威爾基之擁護者及一九四八年可能爲共和黨候選總統之史德森等，在議院中亦不時投票贊成政府之施策，故右翼共和黨喉舌如芝加哥論壇報等，亦呼出驅逐威爾基主義史德森主義之口號。</p>

<h3>膠州公園競選演說　奚玉書聲明不是來出風頭　希望喚起人民　認識民主政治</h3>
<p>在全國一片民主呼聲中，本市參議員競選將在廿八日舉行了。爲此，當局特從昨犬起，將各公園免費開放，以作各候選人競選演講的塲所。</p>
<p>「競選演講」，這在中國一般人民，還是個新鮮名詞。但在歐美各國都早已人人知道的了。逢到大選的時候，那種到處遊說，熱烈緊張，如火如茶的表現，眞够熱鬧。</p>
<p>參加競選演講第一人的江寗區市參議員候選人奚玉書，昨天上午，特假膠州公園，對一千餘聽衆，作公開的競選演講。那時候正是風和日麗，碧天無垠，莊嚴的國旗在頭頂飄揚着，正象徵着民主中國的前途，萬里無疆。</p>
<p>他首先便說：「我不是來出風頭，面是來提侶實踐民主精神的」。</p>
<p>中國如今是民主獨立的國家了，政府爲了實行憲政，特召開國民大會。但是要如此，必先從地方自治開始，建立民主的地方政府，作爲實施憲政的基礎。民主政治必須由下而上，否　便是上層的，空洞的，官僚的，但是憲政並非一天就可達到，必須一步一步做來。選舉·罷免·創制·複決·是民權的四個階段。選舉是第一步，我們就應該謹愼的來運用它」。</p>

<h3>·漕河涇暮春雅集·　大張筵席　欣賞牡丹花</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邁天</p>
<p>同樣是百花爭艷的季節，可是今年的春天似乎比往年更加可愛。</p>
<p>漕河涇黃家花園的百年大牡丹，昨日吸引了一千以上的欣賞者。記者和錢劍秋女士等十多人走進園門，即見賓客滿堂，園主黃金榮氏親自在「四敎廳」前拱手迎客，正好像是家有喜慶一般。這幾株百年大牡丹，的確是名不虛傳，主人特用鐵絲網木栅圍護，還備了一桌祭菜，點了香燭供着。往年，每到牡丹盛放的時候，黃氏必邀至親好友會聚賞花暢飲，熱鬧一番。</p>
<p>自從黃家花國給敵人的獸蹄踐踏以後，全部別牡，包括祠堂，佛廳，和一切珍貴古董傢具，甚至動物園裏的飛禽走獸，全被鬼子們殺盡摧毀，値錢的東西，都裝運回國，連蔣主席在民國二十年題在石碑上的「文行忠信」四字，也被削毀糢　了。　　這　株牡丹，　　　多方設法，討了很大代價，才算保住。黃氏語　者。「民國卅一年，日本橡皮船隊及馬隊衝進我們的園子，住了八個多月，把我們住屋內的全部古董傢供，搬走的搬走，燒光的燒光，等到搜括一空時，就用炸藥把空屋一炸而盡，連我們的祠堂也給毀了！最後我費盡力氣和金錢，好容易把他們請了出去。今天用的桌子椅子，暹都是借米的呢！」「可是，」他慨嘆地說：「再要從新造起來，一時還不可能，現在材料建築費等等多貴呀！」</p>
<p>昨天的黃家花國，顯出了八年來第一次的空前盛况，黃氏備了比大飯店襄山珍海味更有韻味的本地菜，邀請至親好友，社會名流，地方長官，各界來賓入席，又公開任遊客們，進去參觀。席間由陳福康等任總招待，忙碌異常，還有貧兒工藝院的軍樂隊奏樂，「四敎廳」中擺了四十方桌，吃了一批又一批，一共不下一百桌，黃氏自己郤輪到最後。他今年高壽已七十九了，可是看去相當健康。他同時非常樂觀，殷勤向每一來賓招呼。他損失固然浩大，可是，現在已經勝利了，相信他老人家能够看見今天這日子，內心一定是無限安慰的。</p>

<h3>大明湖景色無恙　濟南却患腦充血</h3>
<p>— 十六日航訊　本報特派員姜軍</p>
<p>凡是〔老殘遊記〕的讀者，對於劉鶚筆下的濟南風情，特別是白妞，黑妞和大明湖，難免有點心神　往。數十年滄　，飄忽荏苒，妞兒姊妹已成歷史的陳跡，到如今，唯有大明湖景，風韻依舊。</p>
<p>三月天，正是春暖花開時節，軟風助我雅興，驅車造訪名湖。極目湖色，別具一格，艷而不膩，雅俗共賞，可惜是海右北地，春來姗姗，此時泛舟湖上，風吹水皺，猶有料峭寒意，湖周四里，綠翠疎稀，倒是北極廟頭，攀高遠矚，城郊垂楊嫩綠，大地一片回春。</p>
<p>歷下古亭　湖上第一勝景</p>
<p>濟南七十二泉，大明湖集其總匯，湖的本身，了無一泉。論湖景，首推歷下亭，亭前有何紹基題聯：「海右此亭古，濟南名士多」。不過歷下古亭，如今已是座新式建築，亭北有一間佈置精緻的會客廳，其南是餐室。據導遊的船家說：仲夏之夜，月圓良宵，此處是名士騷客設宴招妓之勝地。</p>
<p>濟南是黃河之濱的一座大城，市塵古雅而不腐朽，雖然市面略至冷落景象，但從商店的門面和陳設看去，可以想像到戰前的濟南，確是一個相當繁榮的城市。城西廓是舊商埠區域，坦平的柏油馬路，從橫雜錯，新型的巨樓巍厦，櫛比林立，風光彷彿靑島。</p>
<p>韓復榘治魯九年，一直到今天，山東人對他的印象並不算壞。我曾經遍詢地方人士對濟南建設的意見，他們一致公認韓老總是曾經勞力過一番的，據說：韓復　不貪汚，做事認眞，他的部隊，紀律嚴肅，當年在濟南的街上，你不會看到一個乘坐人力車的軍人，也沒有軍人欺凌老百姓的情事。老總就是吃了不識字的虧，做事儘管認眞能幹，有時不免糊塗。審理匪案而誤殺良民的笑話，至今哄傳遐邇。他終於因凟職誤國而被判處了死刑。</p>
<p>城外廿里　係共軍封銷區</p>
<p>就山東現時局勢論，政府控制的七城六鎭以外，濟南該算是最完整的地方。聽說是共軍原定計劃，要佔領整個長江以北的廣大地區，尤其是山東省境，不容中央軍有一兵一卒立足之地，幸賴國軍出奇致勝，始得確保今日濟南之治安。又有另一個傳說：當何思源主席率領游擊隊收復濟南，時，控制於政府手中之縣區，尙有二分之一，曾幾何時，所存者幾希？畢竟底事如何，記者不得分曉。</p>
<p>濟南城周二十里外，盡是共軍封鎖地帶，可是，居住在這座籠域裏的七十幾萬市民，人心鎭定，安度生活，一若平時。老百姓都很淸楚，王耀武將軍坐鎭濟南，他們的生命財產，已經獲得了確切的保障。他們說：可惜王將軍來得稍遲了些。</p>
<p>魯省貧血　惟濟南為例外</p>
<p>當然，老百姓的煩惱是有的，那就是：共軍封鎖物資，刺激物價上漲，加重人民的生活負扒，而且一天加重一天。濟南靑島間，雖說是公路已通，無奈貨運不暢，唯一的希望，祇有寄托在善後救濟總署的補給。</p>
<p>由於山東省百分之八十五以上的地區爲共軍所佔據，人如潮湧，紛紛奔向濟南。於是，今日之濟南，大有羣賢畢集，人才擠擠之現象。有人做這樣的比喩：濟南現在的情形，彷彿是一個患着「腦充血」的病人。而他的四肢——山東各縣，正相反的是普遍「貧血」。</p>
<p>市政工作已由主席代庖</p>
<p>除此而外，濟南的第二個史無前例的奇蹟：流亡縣府麕集，凡五十餘個，此中情景，頗似戰時的英倫，祇是這些冠蓋者流，不比在英倫到處受歡迎，一般山東人對他們深表責難，認爲他們把烏紗帽扔棄一隅，遠離工作崗位，遁跡濟南，安度其寓公生涯，顯然不是革命者應有的態度。</p>
<p>在濟南，看山東，山東的尷尬局面，實有待於迅速的解決。市長張金銘對記者說：他現在簡直毫無事事，因爲山東省府的權力，目前實際滲透了的地方，僅此一個濟南，市政工作都被主席去代庖了。當時，記者答覆他：</p>
<p>「市長先生，當閣下有事可做的時候，中國就有辦法了！』（十六日，於濟南。）</p>
<h3>健全的省：浙江　沈鴻烈談治浙基本方針</h3>
<p>— 本報杭州通訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>上杭州的當天上午，到霞飛路晤見了新任浙江省政府主席沈鴻烈先生。沈先生的身材並不高大，穿着藏靑的西裝，橢圓形的臉上，架着一副黑邊的眼睛，險色異常的紅潤。我問他對浙江的印象或意見。他告訴我：有一次從奉化經各縣返職，覺得浙江的風景美麗極了。廿一年，到過杭州一次，遊覽了許多勝蹟，蔣委員長蒙難脫險後又到過杭州一次。</p>
<p>印象極佳</p>
<p>他對於浙江的印象好極了，他說浙江是個健康的人，人民的知識水準相當高，生活也相當好。他這次就任浙省主席，是受命於匆遽之間，對於治理浙江的辦法，認爲須君人民的需要。空談許多大方針，是沒有用處的。他一再强調浙江是個健全的省份，一切都上了軌道，對健全的人總是有辦法的。</p>
<p>準備出巡</p>
<p>沈先生先預備在杭州躭一時期，然後要出巡各縣，他說以往在山東時，一百多個縣都跑遍。</p>
<p>「人民的需要！」我辭出後把這句話再四的在腦筋裘縈迥着。　踏上了滬杭綫，在車廂裏碰見很多浙江人，有的是浙東的，有的是浙西的，他們一致慨嘆着戰後的生活已遠不如戰前了。</p>
<p>閒談民生</p>
<p>一位滿腮鬍髭的紹興人說：「有幾縣，鄉下着實不太平靜呢！什麽游擊隊，新四軍，攪一個不淸，現在雖是勝利了，但這批吃慣便宜飯的人，誰肯再回老家去，辛辛苦苦的種田呢？」</p>
<p>在車廂裏的浙江人，差不多都和他們閒談過了，他們到底需要什麽呢？需要安居樂業，使他們的生活過得下去！</p>
<p>浙江本來不是一個工業繁盛的區域，但是他的農產品很豐富，現在農村不安，農民們都向城市裏跑，這是減少生產增加消費的眞原因，是浙江當前的危機。所以要使浙江能够發廣，第一要安定浙江的農村，再求工業上的發展，譬如浙江的絲，茶，是很著名的，如果我們把農村安定好，大量的種茶養蠶，開辦大規模的茶塲與紡織廠，那慶，浙江的前途就未可限量了。現在農民的基本生活還不能維持，這些辦茶塲，紡織廠的事業，實在變成了痴人說夢了。（十五日）</p>
<h3>成都文化水準低　新聞界皺眉歎息</h3>
<p>— 十四日成都航訊　郭鴻寄</p>
<p>久居在重慶的人，時常有一句頗爲感慨的話從口頭吐出來：「成都天堂重慶地獄。」成都何以是天堂而重慶又何以是地獄呢？那是由於以下的種種因素而來的。重慶的法令苛嚴，飯館中禁止售酒，賭博隨時被抓；在成都，則都可公然行之。重慶的街道高低不平，上下坡時吃力異常，且往往容易走入絕處。成都街道平坦，作井字形，不但走在上面悠然自得，且亦左右逢源。在重慶各項奢侈品都在違禁之列；在成都却觸目皆是，決不愁有錢沒處化。重慶無風景區，如南泉，北殕等地，均離市區過遠，往返不便，成都風景區頗多，如華西壩，望江樓，工部草堂，武侯祠，安步當車，即可流連觀光。總之，不論衣，食，住，行，成都遠較重慶具有優越的條件，無怪乎重慶人有天堂地獄之嘆了。</p>
<p>記者離開戰時陪都的重慶有三年之久了，對於那裏的情形已頗多隔閡。近二年來，均寓居成都，故對於這「天堂」的城市知之較詳。不過，這裏且不談它的一般概况，僅就文化事業的一門—報業爲它刻劃下一幅輪廓盡來。</p>
<p>成都的文化水準，是低得可憐的，目前連一個像樣的雜誌都沒有，如果光以這點來說，比之戰前的平，滬，戰爭期中的重慶，那它不能是天堂，而該是地獄！確切地說，是沙漠了。</p>
<p>成都的人口近八十萬。報紙有十二家，道數目也許不能算少吧，然而據調査所得，本地報紙每天銷售的總額不出三萬份，每報平均的發行數量僅得二千五百份弱。現在把各報的背景內容組織等等，一一簡述於后：</p>
<p>（一）中央日報：這是國民黨在蓉的唯一機關報。由瞿冰森任社長，瞿氏在新聞界資格甚老，二十年前即曾服務北平晟報。報紙之作風尙稱嚴謹，然失之呆板，新聞雖多而無特色，言論穩健而無魄力，其副列亦復如是。每日出對開紙一張，中間曾一度加印牛張，旋以賠累過鉅而又廢止。發行量最高額爲一萬份，現呈下降之勢。</p>
<p>（二）新中國日報：爲中國靑年黨機關報，社長原爲宋益淸，該黨中委，今春宋氏隨左舜生赴滬籌備中華新報，遣職由李璜接任。該報言論，一年前與中共，民主同盟互通聲氣，攻擊政府不遣餘力，勝利後態度轉變，對政府漸趨合作矣。自東北間題發生以來，該報本「內除國賊，外抗强權」之主張，抨擊蘇聯最烈。該報消息頗靈活，電訊通訊頗不少，日出對開張一張，銷行額曾至八千份，現降回五千份，在當地學生界具有相當力量。</p>
<p>（三）華西日報：社長劉自新，畢業於復旦大學新聞系，一反以前作風，而流於趣味。</p>
<p>（三）黃埔日報：原名黨軍日報，廿六年創辦，隸屬中央軍校，勝利後因軍隊國家化之呼聲甚囂塵上，乃改今名。現新董事長爲軍校敎育長萬耀煌將軍，社長王裕先。</p>
<p>（四）成都快報：現任社長為川省某區行政督察專員史良，去秋因內部人事問題停刋，至今春復刋</p>
<p>（五）新新新聞：牌子老，銷行廣，作風陳舊，社長陳斯孝，一留日學生，現任川省省黨部監委。該報惟地方消息獨多。</p>
<p>（六）新民報日報：無黨無派，純商業報紙。發行人爲川籍參政員陳銘德。</p>
<p>（七）西南新聞：董事長爲川康綏靖主任鄧錫侯將軍，社長蔡玉彬</p>
<p>（八）成都英文日報：爲此間唯一英文報紙，由英大使館新聞處成都分處主辦。</p>
<p>（九）新民報晚刋：發行人陳銘德。該報以副刋見長，新聞亦以趣味爲主。初曾銷至兩萬份左右，勝利后因內部主要幹部他往，已呈一蹶不振，現日銷三千份。</p>
<p>（十）成都晚報：發行人姚守先。該報於某一時期，曾因內部陣容整齊，言論有力，銷至二萬餘份，破蓉市報業界之紀錄。然爲時不久，因故改組，繼起無人，遂淪爲一黃色報紙。</p>
<p>（十一）東方夜報：幕後主持人爲川省警察局長徐中齊。</p>
<p>成都各報，備盡於此了，在抗戰期間，各報均能勉强維持，略有盈餘者亦復不少。但自從外埠報紙尤其是上海報內銷以來，銷路驟形减低。除新新新聞一家外，沒有一家不是大賠其本。目前報業中人心中都蒙上了陰影，皺眉嘆息，為自身的前途感到徬徨不安。唯一的補救辦法，祗有從改善內容上着手，不然，其前途將愈趨黯淡無疑。</p>

<h3>杭校風潮多</h3>
<p>高工學生要求校舍停課　浙大學生要求公黃懼課</p>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕杭州高級工業學校，原係浙西臨工改組而成，目上年勝利後，出昌化遷杭，經敎廳指定松木塲彌陀寺爲校舍，惟該寺駐有軍隊，迭經交涉，迄未遷讓，該校校長陳靈生，爲維持學生學業，乃設法覓得西湖郭莊房屋一所，先行上課，而以房舍過少，僅足容納學生一百餘人，致引起其餘學生之不滿，發生驅逐校長風潮，一面停課，分向省府敎廳請願。經該廳派員調査眞相後，特由主管科長洪熾昌前往該寺，商准駐軍讓出一部份房屋，作學生上課之需，一面召集全體學生訓話，對彼等行動越軌，予以訓誡，並將爲首肇事學生五人，各記大暹二次，小過二次，暫保學籍，留校察督。故十入日起，已全體照常上課，一塲風潮，已吿解決。（瘦）</p>
<p>〔又訊〕浙江大學校本部公費生，爲對敎育當局表示「衣食足而後安心求學」之決心起兌，自十七日起罷課。該校當局以罷課對學生學業損失綦重，已採用折中辦法，先行借墊膳食，不敷之數，並即電促敎部按照實際困難，宜予增加公費待遇，使與當前物價適應，學生已表滿意，於十八日復課云。（蝶）</p>

<h3>本市大學敎授與小學敎員　紛向朱部長請願　共同目的為要求改善待遇</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕敎育部朱部長，昨日上午十時，在三靑團上海支團部，接見上海國立大學敎授代表：復且大學汪禮彰，應功九，朱復；同濟大學顧葆常；曁南大學謬傑；交通大學陳石英，陳大爕，曹鶴蓀，祝百英，王達時。</p>
<p>太學敎授請願</p>
<p>交談二小時，毫無結果。朱部畏報吿大學敎員硏究費，已決定自五百元至二千元，改爲自一萬元至二萬五千元，惟在二月時已提出存案，目前且尙未實行，故實與敎授所請求者無關。當時朱部長亦表示此區區之數，並未能解決問題，僅略表示意思而已。敎授原曾一再提出改善待遇之兩個合理原則，即第一敎授待遇，應另立計算標準，第二其標準必須將一部份新津與生活指數發生關係。朱部長對此只允硏究考慮，敎授代表則要求朱部長向政府提出上述原則，且必出全力以爭取之。</p>
<p>大學學生請願</p>
<p>正値朱部長與敎授代表接談之際，交大及臨大第一分班學生代表，亦率領隊伍到塲請願，要求朱部長允諾敎授要求，以便即日復課，免荒學業。學生直立烈日之下，數小時，迄敎授代表散去時，部長尙未出見。聞臨大全體敎授已電敎部響應，亦表示若四月底前無圓滿解決，則五月一日將全體停敎，堅決要求切實改眞待遇。重慶復旦大學總校，已來函上海復大，謂已發動響應。上海各國立大學敎授代義，以請求毫無結果，擬向蔣主席請願，並準備於國大開會時，赴京請願，以維建國時期敎育第一之原則云。</p>
<p>小學敎師請願</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市小學敎師聯合進修會，於昨日上午推代表三百餘人，至中央硏究院，向朱部長請願，適朱部長他適，由匡　書，賀司長，先後接見，代表即遞送呈文，要求三點：（一）援市校敎師例，私立中學敎師，每人應發給補助金二十萬元，小學每人十五萬元，（二）敎師無公私之分，待遇應相同，（三）提高敎育經費百分此至百分之卅。最後由賀司長向衆宣佈，至遲於星期一上午，將所提要求，負責轉咨市府，令飭市敎局切實辦理。代表等認爲滿意，乃整隊散去。</p>

<p>自遷回成都以後，川大的敎授和學生立即活躍來，他們參加校外學術的，政治的各種活動。這時候，成都已有好幾個大學，有許多都是國內很有名的：在華西蜀有華西，金陵男大，女大，齊魯，中大醫學院，西外有光華，城內有後來的燕京等校。論規模沒有一校比得上川大，因此，如果有對立競爭的事情，華西各大學聯在一起共同對付川大，合作的事情，川大以國立之故，無　中站在領導地位。從卅二年到現在院系人數一年比一年增加。三十三年增設夜校，這是專爲失學的職業靑年而設立的，規定五年讀滿全部課程。照樣可以發給夜校畢業證書，已得敎部的核准。這是一種大胆的嘗試，但結果並不算壞，（以前東吳滬江也有夜校的設立，但部是敎會學校）。三十四年改理學院爲理工學院，增設航空工程系，水利土木工程系，並添設師範學院第二部。目前全校學生共計校本部三千六百四十人，夜校及升學預備約一千二百人，將及五千之數，論人數全國各大學，除中央大學外，恐怕算是最多的一個了。院系目的數計，文學院，中文，外文，史地三系；法學院，法律，政治，經濟三系及一司法組，理學院，數學，物理化學，生物，土木水利，航空工程六系及一化學專修科；農學院，農藝，森林，園藝，植病害，蠶桑，農經，農化七系；師範學院，敎育，公訓，國文，英語，史地，數學，理化七學系（本年度起除敎育公訓幷擬另設體育系外其餘皆合併文理學院）。夜校有中文，法律，商學三組，及敎育，英語，新聞選枓生。此外尙有文科研究所，理科研究所，及師範第二部。</p>
<p>這樣大的規模，這樣多的人數的學校，對於將來四川的前途，一定有重大的影響。依據主席中國之命運的佔計推算，今後十年內單是四川一省，至少需要五萬專科以上舉業的人才，這批人才的培植如果川大擔負一半，照目前每年畢業人數不到五百人計算，要五十年經能養成，如此看來。川大的前途豈有限最！</p>
<p>但問題幷沒有這樣簡單，從質的方面來講，在今日不僅川大，全國各大學沒有一固能够叫人滿意。師資缺乏，設備簡陋，經費不足，眞是百孔千瘡！論設備川大有很好的學校環境，如果以前任校長的建築計劃能够實現，可以容納一萬學生，平均每年可以造就一千以上的人林。但這筆經費，照目前的物價計算，不知要若干億元？川大總算沒有受到戰爭的重大損害，但所謂藏書二十萬，多半是五年以前的舊書，而且因為由幾個學校雜凑而來的，有的殘缺不全，有的重複過剩，要添置補充談何容易？儀器川大不能算少，但大都已經過時，當科學發展日新月異的原子時代，要追上先前國家簡直要從頭辦起。這些問題不是川大單獨的問題，是全國各大學的共同問題，要國家作全盤的解決。今日川大惟一佔便宜的。是其他各校，正忙於計劃搬遷復校的時候，它可以早一二年開始建設了。</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>上週物價又起波動　民生大受威脅　取締投機刻不容緩！</h3>
<p>本市商業金融市况，近來本已漸上軌道，金價穩定在一六〇萬左右，米價盤旋於二萬五六頗久，紗布市面，亦無復從前之飛楊浮躁，個使繼續努力，前途未始無望，乃蘊蓄多日之風浪，至上週突然爆發，公債黑市雖經警局取締，能事實上漲價如故，米貸發放以後，米價立即飛漲近萬，不許進口之外貨，商人無法結匯，羣向市塲購美紗，於是美鈔又連跳，面金價亦隨之起伏，同時電車電燈自來水以及火車客貨運，亦均於此時加價，於是似將平穩之物價，又鼓起掀大巨浪，前途如何，殊難逆料，茲分誌其梗槪如后：</p>
<p>烚赤　中行配售不間斷，上週徵有起伏，實係投機者活動套買所致，週一開時高見一六二萬，後即退至一五五萬，週二至週四徘徊一五三五萬之間，週五六又告挺秀，因證券帮套實，銀樓抵補，價由一五五萬升至一六二萬間，至週末最後價爲一五七萬五。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔交易頗旺，中行美滙雖仍掛二〇二〇元未更，但進口商結款頗多，加以游資的進出，故中間時有起伏，尤以週五六爲最俏利，頂高至二四三〇元，頂低二〇八〇元，週末最後價　至二二二〇元，或謂中行對大數之美滙申請，未能核准，但據中行方面聲稱，正當商人申請無有不准者，或謂美國出口商可將美鈔代替美滙，故一般禁止進口的貨物之輸入商以及投機份子乃在市塲大肆活動云。</p>
<p>公債　因銀根奇鬆，游責集中統一公積，市勢頓呈白熱化，高價層出不窮，週初在買氣彌漫中，丙種躍出五千大關，嗣以人造絲帮逢高吐售，退入關內，終比上週未軋升五百六七十元，其他各債亦吿躍進，週二買氣未减，丙晨自五一〇〇喊開後直上五三五〇元，午刻散戶了售回挫二百元左右，其餘均被帶升，成交頗多，週三漲風變本加厲，散戶與紗花帮力進不懈，市勢更形絢爛，丙種竟由五千二百五十元步升至五千五百元之空前高價，嗣因警局積極取締，狂飆頓息，週四統債僅有浮空抵補之零星交易，價喊高百數十元，週五仍未正式開做，僅稍有了結交易，丙種喊價曾創五七○〇元空前高價。最後削低二百餘元，週末統一公憤黑市晨開五四〇〇元，一度回小，終吿軋平，其他各債各升百元左右。</p>
<p>股票　週初華股先跌後漲，初以銀根鬆弛，欣欣向榮，嗣以財產徵稅問題，人心處弱紛吿出籠，紗廠美亞各退入五四千內，午後大戶有吸，各回昻二百餘元，三小型股升十元至卅元不一，外股因有設立分市塲之傳說，及受英商之操縱，怡和軋升一二百元，會德豐升五百元，紙業怡　各升二百元，英聯軋平，週二華股市况晨開在散戶吸收下，秒廠昻至五二〇〇元，美亞四四〇〇元，嗣以浮多吐售，俏勢頓　，下午買氣大盛，結果紗廠及景福軋平，美亞升八十元，外股因廣帮度利吐售，各吿回小，週三華股供過於求，市况平疲，午後略形好轉，紗廠美亞各降二百元左右，外股則升降不一，週四華股以川幫吐售，續吿下游，紗廠美亞各降百餘元，三小熱股除新光外，各低三五元，外股未正式做開，週五華股市况窒悶，價在大户出籠下劇降，紗廠退至四五〇〇元，景福三百八九十元，午收情形穩定，外股慶續休市，週末華股先呈疲弱，嗣以浮多趁低吸纳，遇見盤升，外股多告上塲。</p>
<p>食糧　週初食米到銷均活，但以產地故意抬升，市價躍升一五〇〇至二〇〇〇元，麵粉因汕頭幫大事搜購，亦騰昻四五百元，週二食米仍多波動，價再升二三百元至千元不等，麵粉供多求少，重進萬元關，雜糧方面，黃豆呆滯，生仁貨稀挺秀，週三食米因貨主扳持，狂灣未退，粳秈米各高三千餘元，陰元升五千元，白元更俏，劇騰七千元，麵粉連袂晋升，雜糧惟生仁獨挫，過四食米漲勢方興米艾，粳秈升五百元，糯米高千元，麵粉續俏百五十元，黃豆生仁均吿高楊，週五微回，惟白元仍站高峯，麵粉因北幫動辦，再升二三百元，黃豆參差，生仁疲千元，週末食米又升一千五百元左右，麵粉亦帶俏七百元，維糧除開封生仁外，一致躍升。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初因滬埠現紗存底有增無减，客幫現紗銷路平常，市勢完全呈徘徊狀態，迄至週末，受上日美鈔與黃金漲風之刺激，而停頓已久之天津幫突起賜辦現紗，內地如京滬路各埠亦需要頗股，於是塲上買戶踴躍，頓呈求過於供之勢，尤以十六支及廿支漲勢爲最俏，全週間以六十支漲鳳二百七十萬爲最高，十支雙牛五十一萬爲最低，若以支數言，則卅二支仙桃細紗比前週末漲廿八萬爲最鉅，十六支天馬光明各漲十二萬，廿支特雙馬漲七萬半，獨四十二支藍鳳無變動。</p>
<p>布市　因旺令時期已過，滬埠存底充沛，客幫乏大批需要，市勢無甚生氣，各牌一致較前週末無大變動，係參差之勢，上下二三千。</p>
<p>花市　始疲繼堅，廠家觀望日多，嗣後因美鈔昂騰，花商板價較高，同業大都拖進，結果各花較前週亦升二三千元。</p>
<p>燃料　至於其他各業，亦多呈堅秀局面，惟燃料因現貨供應，籌碼充斥，市塲人心疲軟，各貨一致看小，陽泉焦作每噸週初爲四十萬元，週末已降至三十六萬元，蒲包炭尤乏人問津，惟市價仍盤旋高峯，每担爲九千元云。</p>
<h3>香港封存商貸　月底一律發還</h3>
<p>〔香港訊〕當香港重光之時，香港軍政當局曾將與敵有關，或戰前存倉貨物，或曾經敵軍統制施用之工廠，貨倉等，一切交由香港產業統制官辦理，加以對用及統制，而由各商民自行搜集證件，向當局申請取回，各商民曾將申請　交產業統制局，但關於解決之消息，仍未有所聞。據悉，此等商民之倉貨，當局已繼續開放發圖，產業統制局，現已開始辦理此積請求，預料在本月底民政恢復以前，當可全部發還與各商人。</p>
<h3>不堪回首　美國貸到滬以後　西樂業生意蕭條　成本太貴工資加高　仿製品受重大打擊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國貨的維他命，磺酸胺，DDT，配尼西靈等製劑，近來在各藥房和伙食店的櫥窗裏，甚致街頭販賣美軍用品的小攤上，普遍地增加起來。論價錢，較同類的國產製齊，便宜五倍十倍，已不算是稀罕的事！「價廉物美」，這原是買主選貨不易的金料玉律。無怪一般人對美國貨的西藥，都要趨之若驚了。過去曾一度飛黃騰達的國產新藥業，似乎已遭遇到了很嚴重的厄運。</p>
<p>仿製品不差　記者曾連訪了這方面的幾位領袖人物，他們異口同聲的說：論上述的幾種新藥製劑，雖說大部份都是這次大戰過程中陸續發明的，可是國人決不甘落後，抱着迎頭趕上去的精神，一樣一樣的仿製成功。論成份除配尼西靈因爲受製造設備的限制，比較上還趕不到外貨的水準外，其他的可說沒有一樣不能跟外貨爭一日的短長。但是，一向以人工低廉見稱於世的上海，目前一個普通工人的薪津，動不動都在十幾萬元左右；拿美金折算起來，都在六七十元左右。而美國高級技工每月所能掙到的工錢，也不過爾爾。</p>
<p>工資太高了　可是比較下來，美國因爲充份利用機器的關係，往往一個工人所做的工作，可以抵到中國許多工人的工作；所以一向佔絕對優勢的勞工成本，現在已相形見絀了。論原料，上海製藥的許多基本原料，十九多是戰前的存貨。</p>
<p>原料太貴了　這些稀罕的原料，連年不是做了囤戶手裏的寵兒，就變了投機市塲裏的皮球，價錢早已給摔到峯類狀態，這更是國產新藥業生產成本上的一個致命傷！</p>
<p>說到外貨西藥原料和成藥的進口，現在因爲船運還未正常暢通，不過是少量的進口；所以普通一支十萬單位的配尼西靈，在美國的價錢不過美金四五角，一到上海，就高到法幣一萬元以外，這分明是暴利，</p>
<p>洋貸賤得多　可是，就拿這價錢，已足打倒國產同樣的製劑而有餘。要是將來貨運日暢，定貨大批湧到，而匯率仍迄立不動的話，那末，國產新藥業的前途，是相當暗淡的！據說：以將來美貨西藥的合理價格算起來，在上海，充其量，只能把它付付工銀而已，遑談其他製造成本！道決不是誇張性的悲觀論，因爲據統計：戰時上海的化工原料廠，大的二十多家，小的也有百把家；</p>
<p>華廠收歇了　可是現在這些廠家，已有百分之九十收歇了。賸下的也都踟躕不前，打着改絃更張的主意。美國一般的化工原料廠，生產磺酸胺粉劑，日以十噸廿噸計；而華商廠家的每日生產最，還是論磅計算的，相去又何啻　壤？說到本市的國產製藥廠，大小也有五十餘家。</p>
<p>吃老本過日　可是大多也營業淸淡，靠着賣存貨，吃老本，過日子！本市一家大型製藥廠的當局坦白地承認：他們最近每月的營業額，拿一半來付開支，還不够，其存貨，都是虧了本賣出去。回顧戰時國產新藥的蓬勃狀態，恍同隔世！</p>
<p>補救的途徑　國產新藥業就此絕望了麽？那也不盡然！有人說：在原料無法競爭之下，是否可使成藥以國人自製爲原則。這樣一來，政府勢必須對現行西藥原料和成藥的關稅率，略予以調整。據說：前者原定百分之廿五，後者百分之卅，兩者相差太微；是否可把原料進口稅率　低，而將成華的進口稅率提高？也有人說：原料進口，應以國人不能自製者爲原則。更有人主張：應該由政府在以濟方面予新　業以有力的支援，以便大批採購國外的設備；再拿自已的人力物力來製造所需用的原料和成藥。道些見解，都有它的理由，值得提供關心新藥業前途的人們做一參考。同時，我們也得認淸，新藥除了它服務於病人的使命外，對國防軍醫方面，也佔有舉足輕重的地位。唯其如此，才使我們更感到國產新藥，有値得扶掖和振興的必要。戰時，上海國蘇新藥業蓬勃的拋物綫，是一飛沖天；但那畢免是畸形的，虛空的，所以經不起外浪的襲擊，這拋物綫地立刻受挫劇降。毋席許言，新藥業的本身基礎，自有其缺點在。有人說是目光欠遠大，有人說是太偏重營利一途，有人說產品成份較差……好在受一次敎訓學一次乘，國產新藥業的復興，政府的帮助是需要的，而本身的加倍充實和努力，更屬首要！否則，如何足以抵抗那方與未艾的巨浪呢？（蒼龍）</p>
<h3>烟廠照常派貸　烟稅調整未實現</h3>
<p>本市捲烟業方面，前傳上海貨物稅局將有調整捲烟稅率之舉，因此有將捲烟廠盤調整新價之說，茲悉當局對捲烟稅率，尙在考慮之中，實行之期亦未有定，故近日仍按舊稅率徵收，最近頤中烟公司新自靑島運來之大量大英牌老刀牌品海牌等香烟，本應另加烟稅，暫不派貨，但現因局方尙未頒佈正式明令，故已照常派貨，而烟價亦未提高云。</p>
<h3>馬來亞物價跌　其原因有三種</h3>
<p>〔馬來亞訊〕馬來亞物價，自去年九月到現在半年中，波動很大，英軍登陸之初，物價曾恢復戰前狀態，自去年十月份起直回漲，今年一月二月之交達到了最高峯。自二月份起，又往下跌了，如黑市米已由一百廿元一担跌到卅五元左右一担，谷貨也平均跌了一倍，物價所以大跌的原因：（一）工廠未復工，各業工人失業多。購買力差。（二），土產及藥出口，而外貨輸入大，吸去大量遊資。（三），二月份起實行麵粉，麵包，肉類，牛乳，香烟配給，影賽物價下跌。但最大原因還是貿易不自由，馬來亞各種生產機構陷于停頓，致　成市塲的麻痺試態。</p>
<h3>平價鹽三萬担　每担一四，二一五元</h3>
<p>本市松江鹽務分局爲抑平食鹽價格供應民需起見，自即日起實行平價配售，其價格每担爲一四，二一五元，數量共爲三萬担，每戶購買數量，並不改制，以售究爲止，如需購該項平價鹽斤者，可逕向新閘路該局辦理領購手續。</p>
<h3>上海之新企業</h3>
<p>泰豐紗廠　股份有限公司，爲鄭耀南等所發起，資本三千萬元，已全部認足，以製造及經營毛紡織品爲業務。</p>
<p>中國紡織工程　股份有限公司，發起人張宏丁等，資本四千二百萬元，已全部認足，其業務爲（一）經理國內外紡織機械及零件，（二）代客買賣紡織原料及製成品，（三）受托管理及代客設計紡織工廠，（四）經營及投資紡織工廠，（五）其他有關事業。</p>
<p>國際蠶絲紡織　股份有限公司，發起人爲金任鈞等，資本一萬萬元，先收半數，由發起人認足四千萬元，以經營育蠶製種繅絲織綢以及絲綢之貿易爲業務。</p>
<p>精益化學廠　股份有限公司，在中正北二路四一弄七四號，初爲獨資性質，資本一百萬元，現改組爲股份有限公司，賣本五百萬元，先收二分之一，以經營化妝品之製銷爲業務。</p>
<p>東南畜植　股份有限公司，發起人爲王式園等，資本二千萬元，已全部認足，以經營畜物及農產事業爲業務。</p>
<h3>漫談金鈔套頭</h3>
<p>自勝利後，美鈔在投機市塲中，炙手可熱，其投機之活躍，超過烚赤，而行情的漲落，足以決定烚赤的動向，這在去年十·十一月間更爲顯著，然自政府將訂定外匯率之訊後，美鈔地位，即一落千丈，蓋一般對美鈔將來能否結款，未敢逆料，所以莫不爭先吐售，前一時期美鈔決定烚赤動向，茲則反轉，而由烚赤決定美鈔的變化了，本來一股對美鈔六百元對烚赤十兩的套頭比率價，至是遂吿打破，一度曾拔開至八百元許，自三月中匯率公佈後，對美匯率定二千〇廿元，美鈔在頭寸充斥的環境下，萎糜不振，同時烚赤也因中行的配售，迫使投機家無法掀風作浪，所以自匯率公佈迄前週，美鈔始終未曾騰漲，抑且一度跌落至一千九百元內，可是自前週起，美鈔的處境，宛如否極泰來，首先傳說是美匯將掛高，神經敏感者，以為美匯本來是有幅度可伸縮，提高未始不可能，於是紛紛吸收，至前週末已回升至二千元外，而上週以來這對美匯率提高傳說依然濃厚，行情再見上漲，週末”曾挺至二千四百元外，美鈔投機，又恢復白熱化，其與烚赤套頭的軋近，也日益顯著，有如下列。週一　七五六週二　七四三週三　七四一週四　七五七週五　六九三週六　七〇九</p>
<p>（註）以最後收盤賣出價計算而得。</p>
<p>這次美鈔突然活躍後，一般對烚赤的套頭，大致仍看爲六〇〇元對十兩，這一趨勢，是否可能，頗爲市塲上所密切注意，就目前美鈔情形來說，提高美匯，政府恐無此意，而且事實上也不需要，而主要的倒是近來進口商向外洋訂購的貨物，續有到埠，這許多定貨裏，不合進口規則的當然也有，到埠以後必須結款，不能得之於中央，勢非向市上搜購美鈔不可，美鈔在實需情形下，加以投機家之推波助瀾，乃造成一往直前之勢。</p>
<p>一般的觀測，對美鈔與烚赤的套頭軋近六〇〇元對十兩，在過程上或許是可能的，因爲烚赤在中央銀行無限制配售下，投機家早已知難而退，試觀近日數次穿出一百六十萬元即不再向前挺進，這是很顯明的例子，不過金鈔套頭達到六〇〇元對十兩時，投機家視烚赤便宜，集合力量來吸，衝破中央銀行配售價而向上，也是很可能的。（德惠）</p>
<h3>台灣省的物價　已與上海平價　來台客商叫苦連天</h3>
<p>〔本報台灣專訊〕此間一般物價，已與上海保持平衡狀態，以最近一月間，招商局自由輸海宇海笛海辰曁台北號相繼駛台，裝來大批物資，尤以麵粉數量最多，進多吸少紛價順趨下游，每袋自台幣七百四十餘元跌落至四百八十元左右，日來雖吿上漲，但仍在上下盤旋，白塘每斤市價十二元，批價九元，檜木每石（一百尺）九百至一千二百元，金價則在每錢七百八十元左右（老秤打八析計算），食米現亦下跌至每斤十六元，至其他日用品，來自上海之中高樂香烟每包三十元，司麥脫襯衫曁化裝品均乏人問津，一般來自上海之客商，莫不焦頭爛額，進退維谷，蓋貨價與滬相差無幾，設須裝運特產，又乏定期航輪，益以台灣公務人員及民衆生活不安，欲在本省開設大規模之百貸店餘食店，前途均感渺茫，而以過剩之游資移台發展工商業或設廠之企圖，現亦以環境關係，不能即爲運用，物質精神兩受損失，至五金類之銅鐵鋁琉璜等價格較低，似能獲利，但被列入禁止出口之例云。</p>

<p>生產建設特輯</p>
<h3>工業化與實用科學</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>誠如美國加大敎授康迪提所說：「中國不能一朝一夕即轉變爲一種運用機械的工業社會如其能之，反爲不幸；僅移用少數西方之機械秘訣與工具，即謂經濟建設可堂完成，其信念亦不容如此輕易。」這旬說話，很坦白的道出了中國工業建設的一些病態，以及工業建設所不該走的路綫；眞是一針見血，沒有人能否認其中的至理的！</p>
<p>這就是說，我們不可能在短暫的時間內做到工業化，我們若要運用機械于發展生產上，是可以做得到的，但這不能算是已經工業化，或者是已經完成經濟建設了；因爲，「機械秘訣與工具乃實用科學經過長期與痛苦之有形結果。」機械的秘訣與工具是建築在實用科學的基石上，有什麽樣的基石，便能襯托着什麽樣的樓閣，基石在日新月異的改進，樓閣也就隨着日新月異的擴展更新，其理甚明。現今，實用科學無時無刻不在進步中，因此機械秘訣與工具也就不停的在新陳代謝，我們縱使能找到了機械的秘訣與工具，而沒有實用科學做它的基礎，那眞不啻海市蜃樓，肥皂泡，暫時發生令人迷離的作用，但不久它一定要幻滅的！所以眞正的工業化與實用科學是相關而不可分的一件事。</p>
<p>在建國工作孔亟的今日，人人都喊建國，樣樣都搶第一，尤其是「工業化」被喊得振天價响，而且最引起國人的注意及興趣。不少人士爲了謀迅速的工業化而大批的洽購外國機器，外國技術；不錯，在過渡時期的中國，獲得了這批機器與技術，來作救急的用途，未盡不裨益大局，不過關係於中國眞正工業化，却須以發達科學爲急務。我們希望在政府方面能有提倡科學，提高敎育經費，獎勵進修研究，提拔專長等「迎頭趕上」的設施，更希望工業界及熱心工業人士能戳力襄助，以竟全功。</p>
<h3>當今之蠶絲業</h3>
<p>— 任衡量</p>
<p>我國自螺祖發明蠶絲以來，已有數千年之歷史，迨海禁旣開，中外通商，蠶絲遂一躍而爲我國之一大出口品，與桐油茶葉幷相媲美。江浙等省農民，咸賴此以爲副業，每年從海外收回利潤，不知凡幾，自後以我國蠶絲界墨守成法，以致出品惡劣，海外市塲，幾盡爲後起之日本所搶奪，繭價低落，市面一蹶不振，農民育蠶興緻，因之大减。但因幷無別種副業代之以興，農村故幾瀕破產，在民廿年時更臻惡化。戰前少數有志蠶絲先覺份子，大聲疾呼，若無錫永泰絲廠技師鄒景衡先生等，屢往日本研究考察，語云，「他山之石，可以攻玉」故在民廿五六年時無錫絲廠林立，大多倣傚日本之改良方法繅製，出品日見精良，幾可與日絲相埒，海外信用日佳，絲繭價格步昻，農民育蠶興會復濃，蓬勃一時，幾有中興氣像矣。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，日寇對我蠶絲事業，極盡摧殘之能事，成立所請華中公司，統制收買繭價開從來未有之低廉記錄，農民虧耗頗鉅，乃不得已紛紛將桑田棵平，改種稻麥。而各民營絲廠之機件，亦遭拆毀無遠。勝利以還，政府有鑒於蠶絲在我國出口地位之重要，乃將接收之敵僞蠶絲組織，以及絹絲。織綢廠等，成立中國蠶絲公司，扶助我國蠶絲事業之發展。而民營絲廠，若錫邑絲業巨擘永泰絲廠嘉泰絲廠等，亦均紛紛發動，但瞻望絲業前途，危機重重，不容樂觀。</p>
<p>一·美國發明之尼龍人造絲，其拉力勻度均優於天然絲，有取天然絲而代之之勢。</p>
<p>二·美國大部份絲織機械，因受戰事期內蠶絲缺少影響，均已多數改裝人造絲織物裝置，故銷路日狹。</p>
<p>三·意大利日本之蠶絲，均貶値求售。</p>
<p>四·目下外滙政策，不利於出口商，故價格低落。</p>
<p>五·目下絲價每担約二百五十萬元，但每擔絲製造時所用燃料費用，幾達一擔絲之半價，矧工價高貴，廠商無利可圖。</p>
<p>故今後之蠶絲業，對於飼育繅製，均應力求改進，若泥於目前之成法，則整個蠶絲業有漸趨沒落之危險也。</p>
<h3>兒童玩具工業的重要性</h3>
<p>— 漢明</p>
<p>提倡兒童玩具工榮，也許有人會唾責爲多餘而無聊的事；的確，在當前國家百孔千瘡，建設孔股，大者如交通運輸及生產事業之恢復及發展，小者如衣食住行的民生間題的解決與增進，可以說是千頭萬緒，百廢待舉的時候，兒童玩具工業當然會被遺忘掉的！不過在這裏，筆者可指出兩點兒童玩具工業的重要性，而證明道是一件不可忽視的事業。</p>
<p>（一）現代兒童的玩具，隨着科學的發達，物質文明的進步而日新月異，且越富有極濃厚的意義與作用。譬如說，現代兒童的玩具有飛機，氣球，火車，輪船，汽東，大砲……等等的模型，而如飛機輪船之類還配有小引擎，此種玩具，不但引起兒童的極大興趣，而且足以令其認識與了解現代進步的科學機械的梗槪，這在敎育的一方面說，眞是一個莫大的收穫呢！此外兒童用的小自行車，小皮球，乒乓球，羽毛球等玩具也都很可以使兒童們在技術上，在體格上收到良好的效果的。</p>
<p>（二）一般說來，世上沒有不愛好玩具的兒童，所以除了家境非常窮困者外，兒童們沒有不整日與玩具爲伍；因此兒童玩具的需求數目實在龐大得可觀，過去因東洋兒童玩具的傾銷而外溢的金錢，亦至足驚人；故兒童玩具的自給，不能不說是一個塞漏卮的辦法。</p>
<p>再者，從此次世界大戰所得來的教訓，使我們深佩第一次世界大戰後，德國的模型敎育的成功，更加深我們對兒童玩具的認識。筆者認爲，兒童玩具不僅是用來逗逗小孩子的笑笑哭哭，或鍛練身體而已，事實吿訴我們，兒童玩具還是一種宏效的敎育工具呢！所以發展兒童玩具工業，還有提倡的價値。</p>
<h3>互商管理概論</h3>

<p>不景氣的久暫</p>
<p>不景氣的存在，旣然對於一般工商業是一種嚴重的威脅，不景氣的久暫問題，也就是每一個管理的人員値得研究的了。這一點要看不景氣的嚴重程度怎樣，如果不景氣的造成原因包括上述四點中的每一點，那末恢復的時期就需要較長，如果祇有一點，那末恢復所需的時期，比較地短，我們可以把不景氣時期所可以看到的徵象，列舉如下：</p>
<p>一·貨品的售價起先有劇烈的傾跌，再繼以緩性的跌價。</p>
<p>二·生產停止，使許多人失業，或一般工商業實行裁員减</p>
<p>三·各種貨價上下不一，但逐漸地跌到相近的地步。</p>
<p>四·所存的原料，逐漸用罄，代以新進的原料，但價格較低。</p>
<p>五·因貨價傾跌，出售貨品，甚至沒有利潤或祇有極少的利潤。</p>
<p>六·銀行放款减少，而應付許多應付的賬款，感覺爲難。</p>
<p>七·羣衆購買都用量低限度造成隨買隨用的現象。</p>
<p>八·小規模的工商菜，因爲不能配合生存的條件而相繼停業。</p>
<p>在不景氣時期要轉爲興盛，就要經過下列的步驟：</p>
<p>一·所有的存貨，慢慢地售出。</p>
<p>二·各方對於貨品，逐漸惑覺需要。</p>
<p>三·因爲貨價逐漸穩定，大衆又逐漸開始較大數量的購買。</p>
<p>四·工商業的生產量可以逐漸增加。</p>
<p>如果照上述的步驟，那末要恢復是比較遲緩的，有時候，因爲特殊情形的發生，就可以使恢復更快，這種特殊的情形，或者是農業的收穫特別豐盛，或者是政府方面有大規模的建設計劃，或者是國外需要大量的生產品，有了這極情形，資金就可以迅速地充厚起來，於是就可以由不景氣而轉爲興盛。</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the Northeast Problem in Chongqing: Marshall Meets with Zhou Enlai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Since General Marshall's return to Chongqing two days ago, he has held two talks with Chairman Chiang and negotiated with President of the Executive Yuan, Soong Tzu-wen, on the Sino-American loan issue. Apart from these, there have been no political interactions. With military conflicts in the Northeast escalating daily, Marshall's calm demeanor is drawing much attention. However, he hosted a tea party at Yiyuan today, inviting representatives from the government and various parties. This is Marshall's first gathering with representatives of various opposition parties in China since his return to Chongqing, where they will exchange views on current military and political issues in China. Besides attending the banquet and meeting guests, Marshall spent the rest of his time studying the report of the Military Mediation Team's representatives to the Northeast with General Gillem.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] General Marshall has arranged a meeting with General Zhou Enlai for 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd, which will be their first meeting since Marshall's return to China. Communist Party sources privately admitted that they were surprised by Marshall's reluctance to immediately involve himself in decisive negotiations. Marshall spent the weekend quietly at Chairman Chiang's residence in Eagle Rock. He dined with President Soong this evening and will attend a cocktail party hosted by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in China tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] To introduce Special Envoy Marshall and his wife to people from all walks of life in the temporary capital, U.S. Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Smyth held a cocktail party at No. 4 Jialing New Village from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. today, inviting people from all walks of life in the temporary capital to attend.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 21st] The Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters is awaiting instructions from the Chongqing Three-Person Group. Marshall and others are in Chongqing discussing ways to resolve the Northeast disputes. It is expected that instructions for the Three-Person Group will arrive in Beiping within a few days, enabling the executive team in the Northeast to take action. After the executive team's tasks are clarified, more teams will be sent to the Northeast. The Military Mediation Department does not appear likely to send teams immediately after the Soviet withdrawal from Harbin and Qiqihar.</p>
<h3>National Army Closes in on Gongzhuling; Communist Party Claims American Planes Strafe Siping Street; Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Denies Fabrication</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] It is reported that the vanguard of the National Army has approached Gongzhuling. The Communist Army has assembled 50,000 to 60,000 troops there, preparing for a fierce battle. General Du Yuming is scheduled to inspect the front lines in person on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Chongqing Dispatch: The situation in Harbin has suddenly become tense. The Communist Army will immediately occupy Harbin after the Soviet withdrawal. Judging from the situation, the National Army only occupies points and lines, while the Communist Army is engaged in area development. The National Army moving from Shenyang to Changchun is now encountering difficulties, and the New First Army in Siping Street is also being threatened by the Communist Army. Because the government receiving officials in Harbin have no troops, some of them have left Harbin for Shenyang. The government may abandon Harbin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang, 20th] Responsible sources report that Harbin is effectively under Communist control. Therefore, the safety of the few government officials remaining there when the Soviet Army withdraws from the city on the 25th is questionable. Mayor Yang is one of the officials staying to hold his post, preparing to receive Harbin from the Soviet Army and hosting a farewell banquet for the Soviet Army on the 21st. However, it is generally expected that Harbin's fate will be the same as Changchun's: the Communist Party will establish its regime after the Soviet withdrawal. Yesterday, a government plane flew over Changchun, reporting that traffic in the city has almost returned to normal.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 21st] With only five days until the Soviet withdrawal from Harbin, the situation in the suburbs is quite tense. Communist sources say that 1,500 National Army troops are retreating from Changchun towards Gongzhuling and are being pursued. Five American journalists and Army Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Legas are reported to be safe and sound.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 21st] Communist anti-American propaganda is intensifying. Today, they again accused American planes of attacking Communist troops in the Siping Street area on the 17th and 19th. On the 19th, one plane was shot down, and it included "one American soldier." Most observers believe this news is inaccurate because American pilots have been ordered to be extremely cautious in Communist-held areas, and weekly flights departing from Shenyang have been prohibited. A government spokesperson believes that this news is deliberately fabricated. He stated that no American planes entered this area, and Americans never fly Chinese planes. Lieutenant General Gillem, Marshall's representative, revealed that the Executive Headquarters had not received any objections from the Communist Party regarding aerial activities. However, Gillem has asked the U.S. Air Force Command to report on U.S. activities in the past week and whether a plane has gone missing.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 21st] The U.S. military headquarters here stated that they would not deny the Communist Party's spokesperson's claim that American planes strafed Siping Street before the facts were investigated. It is claimed that, except for one American plane carrying Major Legas to Changchun, no other American planes flew to that area. Since Special Envoy Marshall returned to China, the Communist side has launched a major attack against the United States, such as: (1) Opposing U.S. assistance to the National Army in deploying to the Northeast; (2) Opposing the use of Lend-Lease Act materials and surplus U.S. military equipment to strengthen the National Army; (3) Strongly opposing U.S. assistance in training the Chinese Air Force, especially bomber squadrons. In addition, the Communist Party opposes financial aid from the United States and other Allied nations to the government. It is claimed that lending to China at this time will only maintain a reactionary dictatorial government. Special Envoy Marshall will hold discussions with all parties in China after spending the weekend in Lin Yuan, but the date for the formal meeting of the Three-Person Group has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission made a statement on the 21st, saying that the Communist Party's newspaper, Chongqing Xinhua Daily, published a report today that American planes strafed Siping Street, which is purely fabricated. Upon investigation, there are no U.S. Air Force units in the Northeast at all. The newspaper's claim that American planes strafed Siping Street and that a plane was shot down is entirely intentional rumor-mongering to confuse the public.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Establishes Railway Administration in Eastern Nine Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The Communist Party has independently established the East Manchuria Railway Administration in the eastern part of the Eastern Nine Provinces, with five branch bureaus under it: Meihekou, Tonghua, Jilin, Lafa, and Chaoyangchuan. It governs the Jilin-Shenyang (Fushun to Jilin), Mei-Ji (Meihekou to Ji'an), Si-Mei (Sipingjie to Meihekou), Chang-Tu (Changchun to Tumen River), La-Ha (Lafa to Harbin), and Tu-Mu (Tumen to Mudanjiang) main lines. According to the Communist side, except for the Wuchang to Harbin and Tumen to Mudanjiang sections, which are not yet open to traffic, and the Fushun-Qingyuan and Changchun-Jilin sections, which are suspended, the remaining 3,000 li are fully open to traffic.</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Sends Liaison Team to Pingyao and Other Counties for Mediation; Northern Section of Datong-Pukou Railway Damaged</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] The government representative Hu Xiangli, the Communist representative Zhang Xiqin, and their entourage from the Taiyuan Central Team liaison group of the Military Mediation Department departed by car at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, heading south to first go to Pingyao, then to Jiexiu, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and Lingshi counties for mediation. Also, the Houma team decided to go to Wenxi to inspect the besieged situation and discuss ways to supply materials on the spot.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] At around 1:00 a.m. on the 14th, six electric poles were sawed down by Communist troops and more than 600 meters of electric wire were cut off at a location 140 kilometers from Qianseyang Fangkou on the northern section of the Datong-Pukou Railway.</p>

<h3>Explosion at Ammunition Depot in Zhenjiang; Chairman Wang Reports the Incident in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st] The No. 116 Field Ammunition Depot of the Logistics Department caught fire at 7:00 p.m. on the 20th, and the sounds of gun and artillery explosions shook the hills, not stopping until 7:00 a.m. on the 21st. The details are as follows: (1) The cause of the fire is said to be either that the car driver left a candle burning while refueling with gasoline or that it was the work of strategists plotting planned destruction. (2) According to unconfirmed estimates, two to three thousand artillery shells and about 200 tons of bullets were burned. (3) The guarding officers and soldiers are being strictly interrogated by the 57th Division. (4) Deputy Division Commander Yang went to the explosion site to comfort the affected people.

(6) Chairman Wang took a car to Wuxi to report the incident to General Tang Enbo.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Youth in Chongqing Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] More than 4,000 overseas Chinese youths in Chongqing deeply appreciate Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance and his great achievements, which are admired by all. They have jointly prepared a memorial and will respectfully pay their respects to Chairman Chiang at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Entrusted with Collecting and Exchanging Fake United Reserve Bank Notes by Hebei Post Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Financial circles report that the government has stipulated that the deadline for collecting and exchanging banknotes issued by the fake Central United Reserve Bank is May 7th and will not be extended. The total amount of fake United Reserve Bank notes issued reached more than 142.9 billion yuan. The Tianjin and Beiping branches of the Central Bank have already collected 80 billion yuan, less than two-thirds of the total. The remaining more than 60 billion yuan of fake United Reserve Bank notes are mostly scattered in remote areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces. This is because the Communist army is disrupting transportation, making it difficult to concentrate for exchange. It is heard that the government, to reduce the losses of the people, has ordered the Central Bank to entrust the Hebei Postal Administration to exchange as much as possible in various places, and it is currently being rushed.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Relief of Suiyuan and Baotou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yong Zi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou Airmail] After Japan surrendered last autumn, General Fu Zuoyi, commander of the 12th War Area (see photo), with extremely agile action, advanced from the Huanxi rear area, where he had fought bitterly for eight years, to Guihua and Baotou within a week. Because the soldiers were well-trained and moved quickly, he soon occupied all counties in Suiyuan Province. At the same time, Deputy Commander Ma Zhanshan was ordered to lead his troops from Halasei in northern Shaanxi into the Shuhu area under the jurisdiction of the 11th War Area, and Deputy Commander Deng Baoshan also arrived in Guihua from Yulin, where he had been stationed for eight years, to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>On Double Tenth National Day, the people of Suiyuan Province enthusiastically celebrated the first festival after the victory of the War of Resistance, and also congratulated General Fu on the recovery of Suiyuan territory. Unfortunately, immediately after this celebration, bad news spread one after another, and then alarms were raised in various parts of Suiyuan Province. Ma Zhanshan led his troops to Datong, where his advance was blocked. There was also contact in Suiyuan, Fengzhen, Liangcheng, and other counties. The prelude to the great war began on October 16th. The Communist army was attacking, and the National Army was defending. The beacon fires on the border suddenly broke through everyone's joyous and exciting emotions.</p>
<p>The troops transferred by the Communist army from northern Shanxi and Chahar became more and more numerous and were elite troops, including those of He Long, Xiao Ke, Nie Rongzhen, etc., totaling about 200,000 people. The Suiyuan troops of the 12th War Area had no choice but to give up several county towns first and retreat to Jining, an important town in eastern Suiyuan. Commander Fu, on the one hand, appealed to the people of the country to stop the civil war, but on the other hand, prepared for any eventuality and made strategic deployments. As a result, the Communist army's offensive became more fierce, and Jining was also evacuated. Guihua and Baotou were finally besieged.</p>
<p>In the Suiyuan battle that lasted more than two months, the two famous cities of Guihua and Baotou were besieged for a full 58 days. The Communist army besieged the city very rapidly. General Deng Baoshan originally wanted to return to Yulin but did not have time to leave the city and had to work with Commander Fu to defend the city walls of Guihua. General Dong Qiwu was responsible for defending Baotou, as was Chairman Feng Qinzai, who was passing through Baotou to Chahar. He Long personally commanded the Communist army's attack on the city. When the attack on Guihua failed, they attacked Baotou again. Both cities had fierce battles. It is said that in an emergency in the western suburbs of Guihua's old city, Commander Fu personally went to the front line, raised his arms to supervise the battle, and shouted loudly to the soldiers: "I am Commander Fu, rush forward!" As a result, the Communist army was defeated, and from then on, the Communist army reorganized its forces and shifted its target to Baotou for another siege, which also failed. Moreover, He Long himself was seriously injured in the suburbs of Baotou.</p>
<p>After the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou was lifted, Commander Fu, together with Deputy Commander Deng, took a flight from Beiping to Chongqing to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The reporters met with them in Lanzhou on their way back. Commander Fu did not consider the victory in this Suiyuan battle to be glorious. On the contrary, he felt very sad in his heart. He did not want any more civil wars to happen, but he hoped that the people of the country would clearly distinguish between right and wrong and see who was fighting whom. When Deputy Commander Deng saw He Long in Beiping, he smiled and said to He, "When we were besieged, the weather was so cold, we really wanted to invite you to come into the city for a meal of youmian ('youmian' is a Suiyuan specialty), but you kept fighting." He Long did not respond. (April 11)</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Executive Department Establishes Troop Reorganization Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The Military Mediation Executive Department Troop Reorganization Office has been established. The government and the U.S. side have appointed personnel.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Appears Dejected; His Wife Writes Defense in Prison; Sends Son to Suzhou to Submit Request for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] After Chen Gongbo was sentenced to death by the Suzhou High Court, his wife, Li Lizhuang, heard the news in prison in Nanjing. Disagreeing with the verdict, she wrote a request for a review in prison on his behalf and ordered her son, Chen Gan, to go to Suzhou and submit it to the High Court for forwarding to the Supreme Court at 5:00 p.m. on the 20th. After receiving this news, the reporter went to Wu Zhong Hotel No. 3, Daoqian Street today to investigate and learned that Chen Gan, under the alias Chen Lin, went to the detention center at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st to visit his father and presented the draft for his review. Chen was very dejected and said sadly to his son, "My death is not far off, there is no need to do this." Chen Gan heard this and tears flowed down his cheeks. He was stopped by the bailiffs before he could leave.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Special Correspondent in Suzhou, 21st] Chen Gongbo repeatedly stated that he did not want to appeal on the day of his trial and sentencing. However, the Suzhou High Court suddenly received a request for review written by Chen's wife, Li Lizhuang, on behalf of Chen in prison in the capital, which was quite unexpected. According to the document, which was sent by Chen's son, Chen Gan, to the High Court for forwarding to the Supreme Court, the reasons for disagreeing with the High Court's verdict are divided into four points: (1) The case was only tried for six hours before the debate was declared over. Important key points of the case and evidence favorable to the defendant were not fully investigated. The document revealed that Chen had used the alias "Zhou Jin" to establish a relationship with the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) since 1940, expressing his support for Chairman Chiang and secretly working for the central government. Xu Tianshen and Chen Zhongping, MIB comrades in charge of contact, can prove this. The MIB had repeatedly sent secret telegrams, instructing him to cover underground workers, protect radio stations, and report on the contents of the secret agreements and negotiations between Wang and the enemy, and also gave instructions on anti-communist matters. "It can be seen that the defendant's loyalty to the country and the nation, his sincerity in supporting the Chairman, and his various measures to preserve the three southeastern provinces and promote national unity are indispensable." (2) The public defender never met the defendant before the trial. Because he did not understand the case and could not know the facts, evidence, and witnesses favorable to the defendant, he could not fully defend him, which was tantamount to a mere formality. "The benefits that the defendant should have received under the law have all been deprived. What fairness can be said about the trial?" (3) The defendant protected the MIB radio station and bailed out central government workers. In military terms, in addition to cooperating with Director Dai, he also contacted Gu Zhutong and He Zhuguo, which shows that he had no intention of resisting the government but was in fact enduring humiliation for the country, preserving the southeastern provinces, and following central government orders. "Even if he does not dare to claim credit for it, he should at least be given leniency in sentencing." (4) After the defendant left Chongqing, he personally sent a letter to Chairman Chiang, expressing his grievances and subsequent remedies, which can be regarded as an expression of surrender. After contacting the MIB in 1940, there were many exchanges and reports, which is even more in line with the surrender regulations. The original court did not cite the surrender regulations to reduce or exempt the sentence but sentenced him to death, which he does not accept. Furthermore, the Suzhou Dahua News has recently published fallacies sympathizing with Chen, which has been strongly refuted by other newspapers here today.</p>
<h3>Capital High Court to Install Electrical Appliances; Trial of Traitors to be Broadcast Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Capital High Court recently sent a letter to the Central Broadcasting Station, requesting the speedy installation of broadcasting equipment so that the trial proceedings can be broadcast everywhere when the work of trying traitors begins. It is reported that the High Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Mei Siping for days, and is now searching for evidence and investigating his property in many ways. The public trial will be held on the first of this month. The trials of traitors Lin Baisheng and Li Shengwu will also begin separately in the coming days. In addition, the High Court has reached an agreement with a certain military authority regarding the detention center at No. 15 Ninghai Road, where the traitors were originally detained, and it has agreed to hand over the entire premises to the High Court for management. The handover procedures are currently underway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 21st] The High Court opened a special investigation court yesterday to interrogate Lu Yiwen, the former puppet Manchukuo ambassador to Germany. Lu quibbled in many ways during the interrogation and admitted, "I really messed up."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 20th] The case of the puppet Shimen Mayor Guan Xishan has been concluded by the Fifth Branch of the Hebei High Court. Recently, the court detailed Guan's crimes of resisting the motherland and harming the people during the War of Resistance and filed a public prosecution. The court has been asked to handle the case with witnesses and letters.</p>
<h3>Three Gorges Hydropower Development Work: Concrete Plans Finalized, Savage Embarks on Return to America to Negotiate Everything</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] World hydropower authority Mr. Savage is scheduled to fly to America on the 21st. This reporter specially interviewed Mr. Qian Changzhao, Vice Chairman of the National Resources Commission, to inquire about the purpose of Mr. Savage's visit to China this time. According to him, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will assist the commission in designing the Three Gorges hydropower development project, which will officially commence on June 1st of this year. However, to coordinate with the design work, the geological conditions of the dam site and sluice gate locations must be explored through on-site drilling, and the entire reservoir must also be surveyed aerially. Mr. Savage's trip is to negotiate with the commission regarding the implementation of drilling and aerial surveying, as well as methods for Chinese engineers to participate in the design. Everything has now been concretely decided. Mr. Savage flew to Chongqing on the 26th of last month and stayed briefly at the National Hydropower Engineering Office of the commission in the Yangtze River. He then accompanied Director Huang Yuxian of the office by boat to Yichang, where he took small boats daily to the vicinity of Nanjin Pass at the Three Gorges exit, climbing mountains and surveying the dam site along the river for five days. Despite his advanced age of 68, he did not spare himself from hardship, which is truly admirable. From Yichang to Hankou, Mr. Savage also inspected the situation of the Yichang-Hankou waterway by boat. After arriving in Hankou, he flew to Nanjing. Mr. Qian happened to return from Taiwan at this time, and after discussing the matter, he felt even more confident that there were no technical problems with the Three Gorges development, and he had even greater faith in the various benefits after the development. Before leaving America, Mr. Savage had drawn eight artistic projection drawings of the Three Gorges sluice gate, dam, power plant, tunnels, etc., as well as how giant ships and small boats would pass through the gate, how electricity would be generated, and how floods would be discharged, so that even those unfamiliar with engineering could understand the entire layout and operation by looking at these projection drawings. Unfortunately, due to excessive baggage, he was unable to bring them. Mr. Savage has now telegraphed America to send the original plates to China by air. After the commission receives them, they will be printed and made public to the masses. Mr. Qian also mentioned that the Yellow River in China is the most severely afflicted by floods. In reality, the total amount of each flood is not very large. In this era of scientific advancement, it should not be allowed to flood as before. Mr. Savage was very interested in this issue and very much wished to apply his fifty years of experience in water management to conduct detailed research. When Mr. Savage comes to China for the third time in October of this year, if circumstances permit, he will personally inspect the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and the Jing-Wei River basin.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Arriving in Nanjing One After Another; Democratic League Representatives to be Proposed Soon; Communist Party Representatives in Nanjing Arranging Accommodation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The work of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee is becoming increasingly tense. The repair of the venue is nearing completion. Within the venue, there will be 100 seats for officials, 200 seats for guests, and 20 seats for journalists. Representatives from various regions, including 35 from Sichuan, 15 from Xikang, and 35 from Jiangxi, departed from Chengdu, Ya'an, and Nanchang respectively yesterday to come to Nanjing. The 51 representatives from Gansu and Qinghai are scheduled to depart from Lanzhou on the 25th to come to Nanjing. Representatives from the Democratic League may be proposed in the short term. Representatives from the Communist Party have also arrived in Nanjing to arrange accommodation. Furthermore, it is reported that the accommodation for the National Assembly representatives will be the dormitory of the Central Political School, which has been renovated.

The food expense is set at 4,500 yuan per person per day, and three meal vouchers will be issued daily. The Preparatory Office of the National Assembly has entrusted several restaurants to handle the catering.</p>
<h3>Election of National Assembly Representatives in Peiping Creates Disturbances</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 21st] The election of National Assembly representatives in this city has been delayed and has already caused some disputes. According to official explanations, occupational representatives cannot be elected because the Chamber of Commerce has just been reorganized, and the work of the farmers' and workers' associations has not yet been put on the right track. In terms of regional representatives, the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau convened the fifteen district chiefs of the city on the eighth of last month to elect sixty candidates for National Assembly representatives, including Chen Yuan. In the future, citizens who have been sworn in can select National Assembly representatives from the above sixty candidates. Currently, because the voter registration lists for each district have not yet been submitted to the election office, representatives have not yet been elected. However, this method of generating regional representatives has aroused dissatisfaction among some people here. Some magazines and more than forty student groups in Peiping recently established the Peiping National Assembly Representative Election Promotion Association and put forward five proposals: (1) Cancel the candidates who have already been proposed; (2) The election organization committee should be jointly composed of virtuous people from all parties; (3) Candidates should be fairly proposed jointly by all parties and people's organizations; (4) Cancel the citizen oath, and implement anonymous voting with citizen certificates; (5) Abolish the Baojia system and implement local autonomy.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 21st] Political waves are again surging in Peiping. Today at 2 PM, the National Assembly Representative Election Promotion Association, which opposes the method of district chiefs selecting candidates for Peiping National Assembly representatives, held a speech meeting in the music hall of Zhongshan Park. The speaker was Chen Jinkun, the director of the Peiping branch of Chaoyang University. As soon as the speech began, he was pelted with stones and eggs. Chen's left eye bled profusely. The national flag was also torn down by a Liu Chengyun, who was arrested and sent to the police station. Four people who presided over the speech went missing. Several students who attended the meeting were also injured.</p>
<h3>Tianjin National Assembly Representatives Held Re-election Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Most of Changlu and Tanggu Salt Flats Occupied by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Because of the political situation, three-quarters of the Hangu salt flats under the Changlu Salt Affairs Administration have now been occupied by the Communist army. At the same time, a part of the Dagu salt flats of the Tanggu factory has also fallen into the hands of the Communist army and cannot produce salt. The Hangu salt flats are the largest of the salt flats under Changlu. The work of the salt flats is to allocate salt. Currently, it is impossible to allocate salt, and there will be no salt to produce next year. By then, the people who rely on Changlu salt will have to worry about eating bland food. The result of the Communist army's wanton destruction of coal mine production and salt flat work in various places has aroused extreme hatred among the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] The Communist army in the eastern section of the coast forcibly collects salt tax, destroying the national tax system.

<h3>Colored Pottery Shards from the Zhou Dynasty Discovered in the Suburbs of Chang'an; Excavated by a Professor from Northwestern University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] Professor Wang Ziyun of Northwestern University has recently been engaged in archaeological research in the suburbs of Chang'an. He has excavated many exquisite red and black pottery and colored pottery shards from a layer of gray soil of about several acres in the Northwest Pavilion of Shaolingyuan in the south of the city. Based on the examination of the forms of the various artifacts, it is concluded that this is the site of the ancient Du Bo Kingdom. According to records, Du Bo was a descendant of the Tao Tang clan of Emperor Yao. During the Zhou Dynasty, it was called Tang Du. King Cheng reduced Tang and enfeoffed the Du Bo Kingdom. To this day, the original site still has Du Cheng Town. People generally only see the ancient relics of Qin, Han, and Tang in Chang'an. This discovery can trace the relics of the primitive culture of the Chinese nation before the Three Dynasties. Mr. Wang is currently planning to discuss with the History Department of Northwestern University to engage in large-scale excavation work. It is expected that it will make many contributions to the Chinese historical community.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Another Plea for Chinese Industry!</h3>
<p>Our newspaper has editorialized more than once, pointing out the crisis in the future of Chinese industry. Given the recent situation in Shanghai's industrial circles, we believe it is imperative to remedy the situation quickly. Otherwise, industry will not only face hardship, but will virtually head towards a dead end. Just look at the once-splendid textile industry. Recently, fabric and dyeing factories have found it unprofitable, and yarn factories are also gradually realizing that high profits will not last. It is clear that other industries, which originally had little profit to begin with, will have even less room to stand. The perilous state of industry is becoming more and more obvious every day, and no one can deny it. If factories are forced to a point where new openings are extremely rare, while closures are numerous and chaotic, then workers will not be asking for wage increases, but rather for relief funds. The workers' calls will not be for strikes, but for resuming work. If we close our eyes and imagine, it seems a picture is about to emerge: countless factories with smokestacks no longer emitting smoke, and a group of workers crying out for food!</p>
<p>Why has Chinese industry fallen into such a state today? The reasons are complex, and all parties bear responsibility, but the authorities bear the greatest responsibility.</p>
<p>First, the instability of the political situation and the failure to restore transportation have led to the stagnation of goods flow and high prices. This is the greatest evil cause. Who planted this evil cause? Undoubtedly, it is the Chinese Communist Party. For the past eight months, both Chinese and foreign individuals have hoped that China's internal political issues could be resolved through political means. The people have been anticipating this, the government has been working towards it, and friendly nations have been assisting. However, although a ceasefire agreement has been signed, attacks by the Communist army in various locations have never completely stopped. Even in the Northeast, which was not originally included in the military mediation arrangements and should have been taken over by the National Government to reclaim sovereignty, the CCP insisted on mobilizing large forces and taking advantage of the delayed withdrawal of Soviet troops to launch large-scale battles. The work of repairing roads and restoring mines in various locations has also been delayed and has not been realized due to the CCP's breach of contract. Coal production remains weak, and cargo transportation remains stagnant. This situation, coupled with military tension and popular unrest, has caused prices, which were already declining, to rebound due to stimulation. Since the rising trend of prices has not been curbed, workers' demands for wage increases will never end, and factories will eventually be forced to a dead end and have no choice but to close down.</p>
<p>Second, the government has not ceased its efforts to stabilize prices, but its efforts are fragmented and lack a comprehensive plan. Even if there is a plan, it is not necessarily firmly implemented, so that prices have always been in a cycle of large increases and small decreases, and small decreases and large increases, continuously growing higher. This is truly a fatal injury to industry, and workers who rely on wages for a living are especially terrified of price changes. Various prices originally showed a general downward trend in early April, but unfortunately, at this time, public utilities actually had a wild price increase movement! Shanghai's electricity fees have been approved to collect a "coal kilogram surcharge," and tap water has also been approved to collect 120 yuan per cubic meter (excluding the surcharge of 20 yuan). It is rumored that trams and buses will also increase by 200 percent in the coming days, and telephone and train fares may follow suit. We also know that these businesses are running at a loss and cannot continue for long, but we do not understand: why did power companies and others first greatly increase salaries and wages, increasing expenditures? We understand even less: why do these public utilities have to engage in a rotating price increase competition with other goods? Especially incomprehensible: why can't the government think from a larger and longer-term perspective, and temporarily adopt a policy of painfully subsidizing public utilities during the period when prices are trending downwards, so as to avoid their price increases and further stimulate the repeated rebound of other prices? The insane state of affairs in the early days of victory, when the Railway Bureau and the Post Office happened to raise prices, triggering shops to compete to raise prices, is now being re-enacted. How regrettable! It must be known that the income from this kind of public utility price increase is not large, and the government's subsidy savings are ultimately limited, but because they are allowed to raise prices, they directly and indirectly stimulate the repeated increase of general prices, so that the cost of living index in April and May, which could have been hoped to be not high, may not decline, or even still tend to increase, thereby further increasing government expenditures and larger deficits, and further causing workers to suffer from heavier living pressures, higher demands, and general industries to feel more and more unable to operate, only to close down one after another. The damage suffered by the country and society will be incalculable. To govern, one must know the big picture, and especially understand how to do big calculations. Then, based on the insights gained from their high-level and far-sighted vision, they can plan the most beneficial plan for the entire society. Otherwise, if they only know how to haggle over the advantages and disadvantages of small matters, thinking that there is one more income here and one less expenditure there, and then comforting themselves with self-praise, they do not know that they are being penny-wise and pound-foolish, which is precisely the result of this policy. The slight gains from past efforts to stabilize prices and appease labor unrest will also be destroyed by these short-sighted policies without leaving anything behind!</p>
<p>Third, speculative merchants are stirring up trouble, and the government seems to not be earnestly investigating and punishing a few of them, so prices often have unreasonable increases. For example, rice prices in this city had already fallen back in the past half month, generally to 25,000 or 26,000 yuan, but unexpectedly, as soon as large rice loan was approved, rice prices rose instead! Production areas were holding out for higher prices, and merchants were speculating and raising prices. With this large amount of money on the market, they searched and purchased nearby, further stimulating the rice merchants' private desire for profit, and thus an unreasonable rice price increase actually appeared. We have long seen that China currently lacks grain and should import grain from overseas. This point must be strongly argued for internationally no matter what. If they only know how to lend large sums of money to compete for rice in the domestic production areas or even in the rivers and canals of this city, it will not only fail to lower rice prices, but may instead stimulate grain prices in this city due to price increases in the production areas. However, although Director Chiang Ting-fu has been shouting himself hoarse in the United States, asking for assistance to our country's grain, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Food Board have repeatedly reduced it, and Britain has even strongly opposed the shipment of surplus grain from Siam to China for assistance. As one of the Allied powers, we have fallen into such an international position after the victory, and can only compete to purchase grain within the domestic mainland, but we have never seen influential figures in society say a word to friendly nations. Originally, borrowing money to buy grain is a good policy and good intention, but because we only buy rice in the mainland, we have instead opened the door for merchants and wholesalers to get rich, and increased the pain of tightening belts and starving for the common people. If the government continues to turn a blind eye and be at a loss, wouldn't it be a big joke? "The people regard food as their heaven." Especially the working class, who consume the most food, if rice prices are not stable, the consumption index will not be low, the labor unrest will not be quelled, and industry will not be stable and prosperous.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must mention the issue of labor discipline. Workers and factories are interdependent, and should not be treated as enemies. In China's current situation, labor and management must cooperate in order to overcome difficulties, revive China's industry, and lay the foundation for China's industrialization. But now, such as the long-term strikes by silk weaving workers, especially the behavior of Yuantong factory workers violently attacking factory owners and employees, and the illegal intrusion of workers from outside the factory or even idle hooligans into the factory to wantonly disrupt, not only violate the discipline that workers should abide by, but also involve disturbing social order. The government has the responsibility to stabilize society and protect enterprises. On this kind of thing, it must not be perfunctory and end with a piece of paper. If we really want to support industry and maintain law and order, then the government should always provide assistance to workers' legal and reasonable demands, and never condone illegal behavior of workers. Those who should be assisted should be assisted, and those who should be punished should be punished. Only then can there be discipline and careers can be managed. Or it is suspected that this may not be understood by workers. In fact, truly sensible and law-abiding workers do not want to destroy China's fragile industrial sprouts and dig their own graves. Removing certain "bad apples" is to protect the peaceful and prosperous life of good workers. Saving factories is saving workers!</p>
<p>Finally, we are willing to talk about the labor movement without avoiding taboos. It is a timely policy for the Kuomintang to support labor. There should be dedicated people in the Kuomintang engaged in the labor movement, which is beyond doubt. Furthermore, from the perspective of the workers themselves, they should organize labor unions according to law with the permission of the government. Factory owners should also understand the general situation and not arbitrarily stop them. However, we must point out that the purpose of the labor movement is to seek welfare for labor. Seek genuine welfare, and never intentionally induce workers to blindly follow with unreasonable demands, ultimately leading them to a dead end without knowing it. Furthermore, the labor movement must get on the right track, and must not use the labor movement as a means for various parties to win over the masses. Parties, groups, political and military forces should closely coordinate on this complex labor movement issue and unify policies. Otherwise, if policies come from multiple sources and orders are inconsistent, it will give an opportunity to those who deliberately sabotage and disrupt the situation. If a "fire" is lit here and a "gate" is opened there, the entire industrial world will be "like water, the deeper it gets, like fire, the more intense it becomes," in constant anxiety. Everyone will not have a good night's sleep, and the workers who truly rely on labor to make a living will eventually all be frowning and complaining about unemployment.</p>
<p>In short: China's current industrial world is oppressed by "low exchange rates and cheap foreign goods," and its manufactured products are already feeling difficult to compete. Furthermore, it is affected by "political instability, failure to restore transportation, unstable prices, and continuous labor unrest," and has almost reached the pain of "lack of maintenance and inability to close." As long as you encounter people in the industrial world, eight or nine out of ten are frowning and sighing, at the end of their rope, which is by no means a minority of people's alarmist talk. As for the general honest and good workers, they also know the fragility of China's industry, and the current treatment of workers is already quite generous. However, after all, reason is less and emotion is more, and it is difficult to avoid being incited by a few short-sighted and selfish people, often going on strike at the slightest provocation, and even extorting by force and violently attacking factory owners, creating a dangerous situation in which work efficiency is generally low and labor discipline is generally lax. If we continue to remain silent on this and do not point out the crisis in the future of Chinese industry, allowing it to continue to act recklessly, calling it "Labor Sacred," the result will actually be no different from digging a trap, causing workers to fall into a deep abyss, and it will be too late to regret it in the future. It is said that the United States wants to find a way to restore the production capacity of Japanese yarn factories to 6 million spindles, and a large number of Japanese prisoners and Japanese expatriates will return to the country. In the near future, Japanese industry will recover its vitality, and China will surely miss this opportunity! We must once again appeal for Chinese industry, that is, appeal for China and the honest and good workers, and request that the government have proper decision-making as soon as possible, supervise and encourage both labor and management to coordinate sincerely, and especially make the industrial world prosper and grow in a society with laws, order, reason, and emotions. If we do not plan for this, but still only focus on provoking antagonism and inciting labor unrest, thinking that this can be considered supporting labor, then we will be going in the opposite direction and will inevitably fail. Those who are stopping the industrialization of China are precisely these people!</p>

<h3>Dark Clouds Have Gathered at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet Union Expresses a Tough Attitude, Saying That the World Organization Cannot Reach a Decision Without Soviet Participation. Britain and the United States Recognize the Possibility of a Breakup with the Soviet Union.</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio today stated bluntly: Important issues related to post-war organization, without the participation of the Soviet Union, or with the Soviet Union participating but opposing, cannot be decided. This official Soviet radio station, in reviewing the Soviet Union's goals and achievements in Eastern Europe, acknowledged that a strong economic and political group is being established from Finland to the Balkans, led by the Soviet Union. Commentator Orlov pointed out the increasingly close relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. He said: These countries recognize that the war has caused drastic changes in the relations between major powers. The Soviet Union has become a major factor in international politics, affecting the dynamics of the entire world. Referring to the Soviet Union's recent decision to ease the terms of surrender for former enemy countries, Orlov said: These countries found it difficult to fulfill their obligations to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government is prepared to adopt compromise measures. Orlov also said: Many countries believe that strengthening political and economic relations with the Soviet Union is the best opportunity to enhance their international status. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's trade relations with neighboring countries are based on "equal rights," without any restrictions on third parties. However, he strongly emphasized that the Soviet Union cannot tolerate political interference in the name of trade. This statement by a Soviet commentator occurred five days before the opening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, foreshadowing the path that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may take in this important conference.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Paris next week. Will the hope of a unified and peaceful solution to European issues be successful? Or will it fail? Diplomatic circles here are quite worried about it. At the same time, it is increasingly felt that this conference is the last effort to promote four-power cooperation in concluding peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that if certain countries do not agree with the peace treaty with Italy, the United States may draft the treaty alone. Britain and the United States acknowledge that each country has a high possibility of a breakup with the Soviet Union at the Paris conference. If the conference is to succeed, it depends on the extent to which the Soviet Union is prepared to compromise. Britain and the United States have both stated that each country intends to adhere to established policies. There is no sign that the Soviet Union will back down, so there is no hope of breaking the eight-month stalemate in drafting European peace treaties.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of the Franco Regime, the Three Powers Will Hold Negotiations. Australia Proposes that the Security Council Investigate the Case of Spain. Representatives from the United States and Mexico Have Both Expressed Their Approval.</h3>

The negotiations will be chaired by figures at the ambassadorial level. The British side is Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Harlech, the French side is Ambassador Massigli, and the U.S. side may be represented by Chargé d'Affaires Waldemar during the absence of Ambassador Harriman. A spokesman for the Foreign Office refused to confirm or deny whether negotiations had begun. Furthermore, the three-power talks will run in parallel with the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] After visiting President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes today, Mexican Foreign Minister Najera announced that the Mexican delegation will support Australia's proposal to investigate Poland's accusation that Spain is threatening world peace. He said: Australia's plan is a good compromise.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] U.S. representative to the Security Council Stettinius is currently drafting a speech here, which he plans to deliver to the Security Council on the 23rd. He expressed his support for Australia's proposal to send a delegation to Spain for investigation. Observers say that Australia's proposal will definitely be adopted by the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 20th] The Spanish Franco government sent a note to the governments of Britain and the United States on the 20th of last month regarding the border issue between France and Spain, stating that Spain would not be responsible for any incidents that occur on the border between France and Spain. Foreign Minister Yada卓 also informed British Ambassador Sir Mallet during their last meeting that the activities of the Spanish Communist guerrillas on the border between France and Spain could cause great danger. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires has also been notified of this matter.</p>
<h3>Iranian Government and Azerbaijan Begin Negotiations</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 21st Broadcast: The Iranian Prime Minister today ordered the Iranian troops stationed in Azerbaijan to remain in their original positions immediately and not to take offensive actions. At the same time, he sent another delegation to investigate the truth and severely punish those who caused the incident.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Launches New Attack on Turkey</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio broadcast today, launching a new attack on Turkey, criticizing it for exporting nine-tenths of its output during the war to supply the National Socialist Party, and saying that Turkey only severed diplomatic relations with Germany when it was determined that Hitler's failure was beyond redemption. As for the declaration of war on Germany six months later, it was purely nominal.</p>
<h3>Northwest Region of Hungary Colonized</h3>
<p>Hungarian Economic and Transportation Systems Are All in Soviet Hands</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Capital of Hungary, 20th] An American economic expert declared today: The Soviet Union is colonizing the northwestern region of Hungary with Ukrainian farmers. This plan has been completed. Ukrainian farmers have gradually infiltrated the Taghe西 region for months. Taghe is a major town in northwestern Hungary. Hungary's entire economic and transportation system is now under the control of the Soviet Union or pro-Soviet factions.</p>
<h3>Patriotism Is a Responsibility, Why Talk About Reward?</h3>
<p>The Righteous People of Crete Are Admirable</p>
<p>[Reuters, Crete, Michalokastron, 20th] An Allied investigation team went to Crete to investigate the righteous people who helped the Allied forces in combat, intending to give monetary rewards.

<h3>Japanese Shidehara Cabinet Will Submit Resignation En Masse, Seeking Political Cooperation with the Three Major Parties. Yoshida Has a Possibility of Succeeding as Prime Minister.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: According to Japanese government spokesperson Ishiguro, the current cabinet will resign soon, and a new cabinet is expected to be formed quickly. Prime Minister Shidehara will be reassigned as Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Well-informed political figures here believe that the Shidehara cabinet will resign en masse. It is expected that Shidehara will accept the Emperor's order to form a new cabinet, supported by the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party.

If these efforts all fail, he may request that all cabinet members resign together, and then completely reorganize the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Acheson Appointed Chairman of the Control Commission for Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Special Dispatch] MacArthur announced today the appointment of his former political advisor Acheson to succeed U.S. representative Marquette as chairman of the Four-Nation Committee for Japan. Neutral observers believe that since MacArthur has now appointed a career diplomat as chairman of the committee, the "undiplomatic" stance taken by the United States in the past two meetings will be more moderate in the future. MacArthur's appointment of Acheson also means that the U.S. Congress has gained the upper hand over the War Department, since all control over Japan has been administered by the War Department until now. Acheson has served in the U.S. diplomatic service for a long time, serving in the U.S. Embassy in China for many years. Before the July 7th Incident, he served as the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. When U.S. Ambassador to China Gauss resigned in 1942, Acheson served as Chargé d'Affaires. Recently, he was reappointed as MacArthur's political advisor.</p>

<h3>The Pope Calls For Reviving Morality</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Vatican Radio said: The Pope yesterday addressed 200 representatives of Italian youth groups, calling for millions of starving children. He said that history shows that the causes of war lie not only in economics and politics, but also in spirituality and religion. Moral degradation has a particularly great impact on young people. Divorce, atheism, obscene books, and obscene entertainment are the three most dangerous factors. He hopes that members of our church can do their best to save them. Children are the starting point for all major human problems, such as marriage, family education, and morality. If they are educated in the spirit of Christ, they can be spared future dangers.</p>

<h3>US Navy Can Be Reduced If United Nations Is Successful, Nimitz Discusses Navy's Mission to Maintain Peace, Truman Approves Bill to Increase Naval Personnel</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Nimitz delivered a speech on the 18th to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, generally discussing the role of the Navy in maintaining peace. Admiral Nimitz suggested that newspaper editors should promote further understanding of the United Nations as their own responsibility. He said: If the United Nations is indeed successful, then the US Navy can be reduced. Today, there is no enemy possessing equal naval strength. Why then do we still need a strong navy? Because the existence of our navy is not only for combat or controlling the seas but also for supporting our foreign policy. We have militarily become the most powerful nation in the world; therefore, for the sake of peace, we have a responsibility to ensure security.</p>
<p>[TASS, Washington, 20th] President Truman has signed a bill stipulating that the peacetime regular naval personnel be increased to 500,000 enlisted men and 35,000 officers (the original number was 230,000 enlisted men and 12,760 officers).

<h3>What Are the Differences Between the American Democratic and Republican Parties After All? The Right-Wing Democrats Are Gradually Similar to the Republicans, The Left-Wing Republicans Are Again Similar to the Democrats</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] What exactly are the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States? This is a question that foreigners have always found puzzling. Today, even the American people themselves are gradually finding it difficult to distinguish. With only seven months until the congressional elections, although the American people consider themselves able to distinguish between the Democratic and Republican parties, they also acknowledge that the right-wing Democrats are gradually becoming similar to the Republicans in their thinking and actions, while the left-wing Republicans are gradually becoming similar to the Democrats. It is generally believed that this phenomenon is sufficient to predict that the Republican Party will form a genuine conservative party, while the Democratic Party will become a genuine liberal party. At the same time, union leaders and left-wing intellectuals will establish a left-wing third party. Of course, these developments will take several years to establish clear banners. It is still remembered that when the late President Roosevelt made a speaking tour of the southern states in 1938, he instructed voters not to elect right-wing Democratic congressmen and to have them join the ranks of the Republican Party. Although the people did not follow this call, those who continued to implement Roosevelt's "New Deal" continued these policies consistently. The current Secretary of Commerce, Wallace, advocates that President Truman, the Democratic leaders of both houses of Congress, and the Democratic National Committee form a special committee with the power to expel from the party Democratic members who vote against the government or its important policies. Right-wing Democratic congressmen from the southern states have expressed serious protests against this proposal. President Truman has not publicly expressed support for this proposal, but in his Jackson Day speech, he said, "I cannot too strongly support the notion of party unity." Although the President wants to carry out reforms within the party, with the election period approaching, he does not want to lose a large number of Democratic members and reduce the strength of his party. Regarding the internal affairs of the Republican Party: Supporters of Willkie and Stetson, who may be Republican presidential candidates in 1948, also occasionally vote in Congress in favor of government policies. Therefore, right-wing Republican mouthpieces such as the Chicago Tribune have also called for the expulsion of Willkie-ism and Stetson-ism.</p>

<h3>Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses Shipping Reconstruction Plan, Will Soon Invite Relevant Agencies to Consult... Restoration of National Transportation Soon to Have New Progress</h3>
<p>Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng, after returning to Fenghua to sweep the ancestral tombs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by express train to inspect transportation affairs. The reporter made a special trip to Yu's residence to pay respects. Yu said: I have not returned to my hometown for more than ten years. This time, returning and witnessing the devastation of my homeland, I am deeply moved. I visited many charitable organizations, schools, public health facilities, and entertainment venues in my hometown and saw that several buildings had been destroyed. For example, the orphanage has no shelter to house orphans, and the work still cannot be started. In addition, I also went to Chiang Kai-shek's hometown, Xikou, and saw that his mother's tomb was still very well preserved, but the Wuling School building was quite severely damaged. Regarding his impressions of transportation construction in the city, Yu said, "I have not yet gained a concrete impression of the city's transportation construction. I will soon convene the heads of the road, electricity, postal, and aviation departments to hear detailed reports." Also, at 2:00 PM yesterday, Yu accompanied the Director of the UNRRA Shanghai Branch, Liu Hongsheng, and the General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Xu Xueyu, to observe the docks, warehouses, and recently imported freighters. Yu stated that the location of the city's docks and warehouses is excellent, but the construction is still too simple. It is quite inconvenient for large vessels of more than 2,000 tons to load and unload goods, and there is a real need for major improvements. Finally, when the reporter inquired about the postwar shipping reconstruction plan, Yu said, "The Ministry of Communications had previously formulated a five-year construction plan, which includes shipping. To cooperate with the construction needs of various departments, relevant agencies and technical experts will soon be invited to consult on the implementation steps. I very much hope that private shipping will develop more." Regarding the transformation of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company into a corporate organization, it has already been decided in the five-year plan, and its operations will be supervised and improved from now on. In addition, Yu expressed optimism about the restoration of national transportation, believing that after Special Envoy Marshall returns to China, there will be new progress in the short term. Minister Yu does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long and will return to Nanjing in the next few days.</p>

<h3>15,000 Sheets of Improved Silkworm Eggs Distributed to Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>News from the China Silkworm Company: The company recently transported 15,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs (each sheet weighing 10 centimeters, selling for 2,000 yuan) from Taiwan to Shanghai and has distributed them to silkworm farmers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk-producing areas. In addition, 142 sheets of original silkworm eggs were also completely distributed last week. Forty sheets were sent to the Xin Can Cun Company in Kunming, and 102 sheets were sent to the Chongqing Silk Industry Company, all of which were gifts for experimental breeding and did not require compensation. According to the company, this type of original species can be divided into two types, strong and weak. The strong type produces less silk, while the weak type produces more silk, making it difficult to balance both. Therefore, this type of original species is limited to silkworm egg production plants for the purpose of manufacturing improved silkworm eggs and distributing them to silkworm farmers. Furthermore, the types are divided into 110, 112, 115, and 108. These four types have achieved good results after being tested in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. If they are also very good after being tested in Yunnan and Chongqing, the company will continue to supply them in the future.</p>
<h3>People's Freedom Protection Association Held Founding General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Association held its founding general meeting at the Law Society on Beile Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over eighty representatives from sixty-four organizations, including temporary advisory councils, attended. Chairman Chen Tingrui said in his speech that the association currently has over ninety participating organizations. The purpose of the association is to protect the people's freedom. The word "freedom" is most valuable. The history of various countries shows revolutions arising to fight for freedom, with millions of heads taken to fight for freedom. These touching and inspiring historical facts are worth noting. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, led the revolution, overthrew the Qing dynasty, and established the Republic of China, also to fight for freedom. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Association is a meaningful undertaking. I hope everyone will work together to protect the people's freedom. Subsequently, the articles of association and temporary motions were passed. Articles 2 and 3 of the articles of association provide detailed regulations on protecting the people's freedom and are specifically recorded below: Article 2: The people's freedoms protected by the association are freedom of person, freedom of residence, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and publication, freedom of communication, freedom of religious belief, and other freedoms that should be enjoyed. Article 3: If the people's freedom is infringed upon, the association has the obligation to protect it according to law. Finally, the following were elected: 45 directors including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Xianqing, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaowen, Wang Yunsheng, and Yong Xiangyun; 15 supervisors including Zhu Xuefan, Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and Chen Diaoyu.</p>

<h3>Search for Missing American Soldiers in China 70-80% Completed, Parents of Fallen Soldiers Most Concerned</h3>
<p>Although the US military is gradually demobilizing in China, they still have many unfinished tasks in China. Before leaving China, General Wedemeyer pointed out several items, one of which was searching for missing soldiers in China. To understand the recent situation, the reporter visited Colonel Charles, director of the Personnel Group of the US Military Headquarters, yesterday. According to him, there are approximately 2,000 missing US soldiers in China. The work of searching for missing soldiers has been intensified after the victory of the War of Resistance. Eight US military personnel were assigned to various locations to carry out this task, and 70-80% has now been completed. Most of the missing American soldiers are pilots. After their planes crashed in China, they sometimes died with the planes, and sometimes they were captured by the enemy and killed. Therefore, the so-called search for missing soldiers is mostly to find their graves or corpses, or the location of their martyrdom. Then, the circumstances and process of their deaths are determined, and a detailed report is made to their families. According to statistics, those who are most concerned about these fallen soldiers are not their wives, brothers, or sisters, but their parents. Currently, many parents are requesting to come to China to investigate the truth because their beloved sons are missing or died in China. The US military authorities must give these affectionate parents detailed explanations to make them understand the reasons for their beloved sons' deaths. This work is still ongoing.</p>

<h3>Jiaozhou Park Election Speech: Xi Yushu Declares He Is Not There to Show Off, but Hopes to Awaken People's Understanding of Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>Amidst a nationwide chorus for democracy, the election of Shanghai's city councilors will be held on the 28th. To this end, the authorities have specially opened all parks free of charge starting yesterday, as venues for campaign speeches by candidates.</p>
<p>"Campaign speech" is still a novel term for most Chinese people. However, it has long been known to everyone in Europe and the United States. During elections, the lobbying, enthusiastic tension, and fiery displays are truly lively.</p>
<p>Xi Yushu, the Jiangning District candidate for city councilor, was the first to hold a campaign speech, giving a public address to over a thousand listeners at Jiaozhou Park yesterday morning. The weather was sunny and the sky was clear, with the solemn national flag fluttering overhead, symbolizing the limitless future of a democratic China.</p>
<p>He began by saying, "I am not here to show off, but to advocate the practical implementation of the spirit of democracy."</p>
<p>China is now a democratic and independent country, and the government is convening a National Assembly to implement constitutional government. But to do so, we must start with local autonomy and establish democratic local governments as the foundation for implementing constitutional government. Democratic politics must be from the bottom up; otherwise, it will be superficial, empty, and bureaucratic. Election, recall, initiative, and referendum are the four stages of civil rights. Election is the first step, and we should use it carefully."</p>
<p>Mr. Xi listed the policy proposals he would present to the City Council if elected, such as improving security, raising police standards, establishing sound finances, building hospitals, expanding transportation routes, increasing education funding, promoting compulsory education, and rebuilding housing for the poor, explaining each in detail.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi also hoped to awaken people's understanding of democratic politics and ensure that this general election adheres to democratic principles.</p>
<p>Cheng Tianfang, a member of the Central Committee who recently arrived in Shanghai, spoke as a guest, saying: "Chinese democratic politics will open a new era from this, a just and honorable activity." Cha Liangjian, President of the local court, said: "What is democracy? It is to ensure that people's physical safety, property, and freedom are legally guaranteed."</p>
<p>The 28th is approaching, so citizens, prepare to vote! Let us first understand the candidates' knowledge, morality, character, and personality, and see if they can speak for the citizens, seek benefits for the local area, and are qualified to be our representatives.</p>
<p>We must not give up our right to vote, but we also need to use it carefully, because it has a great impact on ourselves and on the local area! (Mu Ren)</p>

<h3>Caoxi Road Late Spring Gathering: Lavish Feast to Appreciate Peonies</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Mai Tian</p>
<p>It is the season when all flowers compete in beauty, but this spring seems more lovely than in previous years.</p>
<p>The century-old peonies in the Huang Family Garden in Caoxi Road attracted over a thousand admirers yesterday. This reporter and Ms. Qian Jianqiu, along with a dozen others, entered the garden gate and immediately saw guests filling the hall. The garden owner, Mr. Huang Jinrong, personally greeted guests in front of the "Four Teachings Hall," as if there were a joyous celebration at home. These century-old peonies are indeed worthy of their reputation. The owner had specially protected them with wire mesh and wooden fences, and even prepared a table of sacrificial dishes, lit incense, and offered prayers. In previous years, whenever the peonies were in full bloom, Mr. Huang would invite close relatives and friends to gather, appreciate the flowers, and drink merrily, creating a lively scene.</p>
<p>Since the Huang Family Garden was trampled by the enemy's hooves, all the special peonies, including the ancestral hall, the Buddha hall, and all the precious antique furniture, and even the birds and animals in the zoo, were killed and destroyed by the Japanese devils. Valuable items were shipped back to their country. Even the four characters "Wen Xing Zhong Xin" (Cultured Conduct Loyalty Trust) inscribed on the stone tablet by Chairman Chiang in the 20th year of the Republic were chiseled away. Only this peony plant was preserved after much effort and at great cost. Mr. Huang told this reporter: "In the 31st year of the Republic, Japanese rubber boat and cavalry teams rushed into our garden and stayed for more than eight months. All the antique furniture in our houses was either moved away or burned to the ground. After they had looted everything, they used explosives to blow up the empty houses, even destroying our ancestral hall! Finally, I spent a lot of effort and money to get them to leave. The tables and chairs we are using today were all borrowed from rice merchants!" "But," he lamented, "it is impossible to rebuild everything at once, as materials and construction costs are too expensive now!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Huang Family Garden showed an unprecedented scene for the first time in eight years. Mr. Huang prepared local dishes more flavorful than the delicacies of Xiangshan Restaurant in the large hotels, inviting close relatives and friends, social celebrities, local officials, and guests from all walks of life to the banquet, and also opened it to the public for visits. Chen Fukang and others served as general hosts, extremely busy. The military band of the Poor Children's Handicraft Institute played music. Forty square tables were set up in the "Four Teachings Hall," with one group eating after another, totaling no less than a hundred tables. Mr. Huang himself was served last. He is already 79 years old this year, but he looks quite healthy. He is also very optimistic and warmly greets every guest. Although his losses were enormous, now that victory has been achieved, I believe that his old heart must be infinitely comforted to see this day.</p>

<h3>Daming Lake Scenery is Unharmed, Jinan Suffers from Cerebral Congestion</h3>
<p>— Air Mail from the 16th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Jun</p>
<p>All readers of "The Travels of Lao Ts'an" cannot help but be fascinated by Liu E's depiction of Jinan's customs, especially Bai Niu, Hei Niu, and Daming Lake. Decades have passed, and the Niu sisters have become a historical relic. Today, only the scenery of Daming Lake remains, with its charm still intact.</p>
<p>March is the season of warm spring and blossoming flowers. A gentle breeze aids my refined interest, and I drive to visit the famous lake. The lake's color is unique, elegant without being cloying, and pleasing to both refined and popular tastes. Unfortunately, it is the northern part of Shandong, and spring arrives late. At this time, boating on the lake, the wind ripples the water, and there is still a chill. The lake is surrounded by four miles of sparse green, but the North Pole Temple stands tall, offering a distant view. The drooping willows on the outskirts of the city are tender green, and the earth is returning to spring.</p>
<p>Lixia Ancient Pavilion is the Top Scenic Spot on the Lake</p>
<p>Jinan has seventy-two springs, and Daming Lake is the collection of them all. The lake itself has no springs. Speaking of the lake's scenery, the Lixia Pavilion is the first to be recommended. There is a couplet inscribed by He Shaoji in front of the pavilion: "This pavilion is ancient to the right of the sea, and Jinan has many famous scholars." However, the Lixia Ancient Pavilion is now a new building. There is an exquisitely furnished reception room to the north of the pavilion, and a dining room to the south. According to the boatman who acts as a guide, on midsummer nights with a full moon, this place is a popular spot for famous scholars and poets to hold banquets and hire prostitutes.</p>
<p>Jinan is a large city on the banks of the Yellow River. The city's atmosphere is ancient and elegant without being corrupt. Although the market is slightly deserted, judging from the facades and furnishings of the shops, one can imagine that pre-war Jinan was indeed a fairly prosperous city. The area west of the city is the old commercial port area, with flat asphalt roads crisscrossing, and new giant buildings standing in rows, reminiscent of Qingdao.</p>
<p>During Han Fuju's nine years of governing Shandong, even today, people in Shandong do not have a bad impression of him. I have inquired among local people for their opinions on Jinan's construction, and they all agree that General Han did put in a lot of effort. It is said that Han Fuju was not corrupt and worked diligently. His troops were disciplined. In Jinan's streets in those years, you would not see a soldier riding in a rickshaw, nor would you see soldiers bullying ordinary people. The general suffered from not being literate, and although he worked diligently and was capable, he was sometimes confused. The joke about wrongly killing innocent people while trying bandit cases is still widely circulated. He was eventually sentenced to death for dereliction of duty and harming the country.</p>
<p>Twenty Miles Outside the City is a Communist Blockade Zone</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation in Shandong, Jinan is considered the most intact place outside the seven cities and six towns controlled by the government. It is said that the Communist army originally planned to occupy the vast area north of the Yangtze River, especially within Shandong Province, not allowing a single soldier of the Central Army to gain a foothold. Fortunately, the National Army was able to win a surprise victory, thus ensuring the security of Jinan today. There is another rumor: when Chairman He Siyuan led the guerrillas to recover Jinan, the county areas controlled by the government still accounted for one-half. How long ago was that? What remains is almost nothing. In the end, this reporter does not know the truth.</p>
<p>Twenty miles outside Jinan city, it is all a Communist blockade zone. However, the more than 700,000 citizens living in this cage are calm and living their lives as usual. The common people are very clear that with General Wang Yaowu stationed in Jinan, their lives and property have been secured. They say: "It's a pity that General Wang came a little late."</p>
<p>Shandong is Anemic, But Jinan is an Exception</p>
<p>Of course, the common people have their troubles, which is that the Communist army's blockade of supplies is driving up prices, increasing the burden on people's lives, and increasing it day by day. Although the highway between Jinan and Qingdao is said to be open, freight transportation is not smooth. The only hope is to rely on the supplies of the Relief Administration.</p>
<p>Because more than 85 percent of Shandong Province is occupied by the Communist army, people are flocking to Jinan. Thus, today's Jinan has a phenomenon of many talents gathering and crowding. Someone made this analogy: Jinan's current situation is like a patient suffering from "cerebral congestion." And its limbs—the counties of Shandong—are, on the contrary, generally "anemic."</p>
<p>Municipal Work Has Been Taken Over by the Chairman</p>
<p>In addition to this, Jinan has a second unprecedented miracle: more than fifty exiled county governments have gathered. The situation is quite similar to wartime England, except that these officials are not as welcome in England. Shandong people generally criticize them, believing that they have abandoned their official positions, left their posts, fled to Jinan, and are living a life of leisure as exiled officials, which is clearly not the attitude of revolutionaries.</p>
<p>In Jinan, looking at Shandong, Shandong's awkward situation is in dire need of a swift solution. Mayor Zhang Jinming told this reporter that he is currently doing almost nothing, because the power of the Shandong Provincial Government is only really present in Jinan. The municipal work has been taken over by the Chairman. At the time, this reporter replied to him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Mayor, when you have something to do, China will have a solution!" (Jinan, 16th)</p>
<h3>Healthy Province: Zhejiang - Shen Honglie Discusses the Basic Principles of Governing Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Our Hangzhou Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>On the morning of my arrival in Hangzhou, I met with Mr. Shen Honglie, the newly appointed Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, on Avenue Joffre. Mr. Shen is not tall. He was wearing a dark blue suit, and his oval face was framed by a pair of black-rimmed glasses. His complexion was unusually rosy. I asked him about his impressions or opinions of Zhejiang. He told me that once, on his way back to work from Fenghua, he felt that the scenery of Zhejiang was extremely beautiful. In the 21st year of the Republic, he visited Hangzhou once and toured many scenic spots. He also visited Hangzhou once after Chairman Chiang was rescued from danger.</p>
<p>Excellent Impression</p>
<p>His impression of Zhejiang is extremely good. He said that Zhejiang is a healthy person. The people's level of knowledge is quite high, and their lives are quite good. This time, he was appointed as the Chairman of Zhejiang Province on short notice. As for the methods of governing Zhejiang, he believes that it is necessary to follow the needs of the people. Empty talk about many grand policies is useless. He repeatedly emphasized that Zhejiang is a healthy province, and everything is on track. There is always a way to deal with a healthy person.</p>
<p>Preparing to Tour</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is preparing to stay in Hangzhou for a period of time, and then he will tour the counties. He said that he had traveled through all of the more than one hundred counties in Shandong in the past.</p>
<p>"The needs of the people!" After I left, I kept pondering this sentence in my mind. I boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou line and met many Zhejiang people in the carriage. Some were from eastern Zhejiang, and some were from western Zhejiang. They all lamented that their lives after the war were far worse than before the war.</p>
<p>Chatting About People's Livelihood</p>
<p>A Shaoxing man with a full beard said: "In some counties, the countryside is really not very peaceful! What guerrillas, New Fourth Army, it's all a mess. Now that we have won, who is willing to go back to their hometown and work hard to farm?"</p>
<p>I talked with almost all the Zhejiang people in the carriage. What do they need after all? They need to live and work in peace, so that they can make a living!</p>
<p>Zhejiang was originally not an area with flourishing industry, but its agricultural products are very abundant. Now that the countryside is restless, farmers are running to the cities. This is the real reason for reducing production and increasing consumption, and it is the current crisis in Zhejiang. Therefore, to enable Zhejiang to develop, the first thing is to stabilize the countryside in Zhejiang, and then seek industrial development. For example, Zhejiang's silk and tea are very famous. If we stabilize the countryside and plant tea and raise silkworms in large quantities, and open large-scale tea farms and textile factories, then the future of Zhejiang will be unlimited. Now the basic lives of farmers cannot be maintained. These businesses of running tea farms and textile factories have really become idle dreams. (15th)</p>
<h3>Low Cultural Level in Chengdu Causes Concern and Sighs in the News Industry</h3>
<p>— Guo Hong, Chengdu Airmail Dispatch, 14th</p>
<p>People who have lived in Chongqing for a long time often utter a rather emotional saying: "Chengdu is heaven, Chongqing is hell." Why is Chengdu heaven and Chongqing hell? It stems from the following factors. Chongqing's laws are strict, alcohol sales are prohibited in restaurants, and gambling is readily suppressed. In Chengdu, these activities can be carried out openly. Chongqing's streets are uneven, making uphill and downhill travel arduous, and often leading to dead ends. Chengdu's streets are flat, arranged in a grid pattern, making walking on them pleasant and offering diverse routes. In Chongqing, all kinds of luxuries are prohibited, but in Chengdu, they are everywhere, and there's no worry about having money but no place to spend it. Chongqing lacks scenic spots. Places like Nanquan and Bei Bei are too far from the city, making travel inconvenient. Chengdu has many scenic spots, such as the West China Dam, Wangjiang Tower, Du Fu Thatched Cottage, and Wuhou Temple. You can stroll and sightsee at your leisure. In short, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, Chengdu offers far superior conditions compared to Chongqing, no wonder Chongqing residents lament about heaven and hell.</p>
<p>It has been three years since this reporter left wartime capital Chongqing, and I am quite unfamiliar with the situation there. For the past two years, I have resided in Chengdu, so I know more about this "heavenly" city. However, I won't discuss its general overview here, but will instead attempt to sketch a portrait of one aspect of its cultural endeavors – the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Chengdu's cultural level is pitifully low. Currently, there isn't even a decent magazine. If we only consider this point, compared to pre-war Peiping and Shanghai, and wartime Chongqing, it shouldn't be heaven, but rather hell! More accurately, it's a desert.</p>
<p>Chengdu's population is nearly 800,000. There are twelve newspapers, which may not seem few in number. However, according to investigations, the total daily circulation of local newspapers is no more than 30,000 copies, with each newspaper averaging just under 2,500 copies. Now, I will briefly describe the background, content, and organization of each newspaper:</p>
<p>(1) Central Daily News: This is the only official newspaper of the Kuomintang in Chengdu. It is headed by Qu Bingsen, who is a veteran in the news industry, having served at the Beijing Shen Bao twenty years ago. The newspaper's style is considered rigorous, but lacks flexibility. Although it has many news stories, they lack uniqueness. Its commentary is steady but lacks vigor. Its supplements are also similar. It publishes one broadsheet per day, and once briefly added a supplementary sheet, but discontinued it due to excessive losses. Its highest circulation was 10,000 copies, but it is currently declining.</p>
<p>(2) New China Daily News: This is the official newspaper of the China Youth Party. The president was originally Song Yiqing, a member of the party's Central Committee. This spring, Song went to Shanghai with Zuo Shunsheng to prepare for the China New News, and the position was taken over by Li Huang. A year ago, the newspaper's commentary communicated with the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, sparing no effort in attacking the government. After the victory, its attitude changed, and it gradually became more cooperative with the government. Since the Northeast issue arose, the newspaper has strongly criticized the Soviet Union based on its principle of "internally eliminating national traitors and externally resisting powerful forces." The newspaper has relatively timely news and numerous telegraphic dispatches and communications. It publishes one broadsheet per day, and its circulation reached 8,000 copies at one point, but has now dropped back to 5,000 copies. It has considerable influence in the local student community.</p>
<p>(3) Huaxi Daily News: President Liu Zixin, graduated from the Journalism Department of Fudan University, reversed the previous style and became more focused on entertainment.</p>
<p>(3) Huangpu Daily News: Originally named the Party Army Daily News, it was founded in 1937 and was affiliated with the Central Military Academy. After the victory, due to the growing calls for the nationalization of the military, it was renamed. The current chairman is General Wan Yaohuang, the education director of the military academy, and the president is Wang Yuxian.</p>
<p>(4) Chengdu Express News: The current president is Shi Liang, the special commissioner of a certain administrative inspectorate district in Sichuan Province. It ceased publication last autumn due to internal personnel issues, and resumed publication this spring.</p>
<p>(5) New News: It has an old brand and wide circulation, but its style is outdated. The president is Chen Sixiao, a student who studied in Japan and is currently a supervisor of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters. This newspaper has a unique abundance of local news.</p>
<p>(6) Xinmin Daily News: It is non-partisan and purely a commercial newspaper. The publisher is Chen Mingde, a Sichuanese senator.</p>
<p>(7) Southwest News: The chairman is General Deng Xihou, the Director of Pacification for Sichuan and Kang provinces, and the president is Cai Yubin.</p>
<p>(8) Chengdu English Daily News: This is the only English newspaper in the area, and it is sponsored by the Chengdu branch of the British Embassy's Information Office.</p>
<p>(9) Xinmin Evening News: Publisher Chen Mingde. This newspaper is known for its supplements, and its news is also mainly focused on entertainment. Initially, it sold around 20,000 copies, but after the victory, due to the departure of key internal personnel, it has declined sharply and now sells 3,000 copies per day.</p>
<p>(10) Chengdu Evening News: Publisher Yao Shouxian. At one point, this newspaper had a well-organized internal team and powerful commentary, selling over 20,000 copies and breaking the record in the Chengdu newspaper industry. However, it did not last long, and it was reorganized due to various reasons. With no one to take over, it has become a yellow newspaper.</p>
<p>(11) Eastern Evening News: The person behind the scenes is Xu Zhongqi, the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Police Department.</p>
<p>This covers all the newspapers in Chengdu. During the War of Resistance, all the newspapers were able to maintain themselves with some effort, and many even had surpluses. However, since the influx of newspapers from other cities, especially Shanghai, the circulation has plummeted. Except for New News, every newspaper is losing money heavily. Currently, people in the newspaper industry are overshadowed with concern, sighing and worrying about their future. The only remedy is to improve the content, otherwise, their future will undoubtedly become increasingly bleak.</p>

<h3>Luo Zonglu Returns to Taiwan, Discusses the Current Situation at National Taiwan University</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Actively Organizing</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Taipei] Luo Zonglu, the president of National Taiwan University, recently returned to Taiwan from Chongqing and made a statement to reporters, stating: Chairman Chiang is very concerned about NTU, inquired about the current situation in detail, and encouraged active organization. The Ministry of Education has recently passed the entire budget for NTU and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review, where it is expected to be approved.

<h3>Many Disturbances in Hangzhou Schools</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Advanced Industrial School Students Demand School Buildings; Zhejiang University Students Demand Increased Public Funding</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou] Hangzhou Advanced Industrial School, originally reorganized from Lin'an Industrial School in western Zhejiang, moved from Changhua to Hangzhou after the victory last year. The Education Department designated the Maitreya Temple in Songmu Chang as the school building. However, the temple was occupied by troops, and despite repeated negotiations, they have not yet moved out. Chen Lingsheng, the principal of the school, in order to maintain the students' studies, found a house in Guo Village on the West Lake and started classes there. However, due to the limited number of rooms, it could only accommodate more than 100 students, which caused dissatisfaction among the remaining students, resulting in a movement to expel the principal. They suspended classes and petitioned the provincial government and the Education Department. After the department sent personnel to investigate the truth, the director of the relevant section, Hong Chichang, went to the temple and negotiated with the garrison to allow a portion of the building to be used for student classes. At the same time, he summoned all the students for an address, admonishing them for their excessive actions and issuing two major demerits and two minor demerits to five students who were the leaders of the incident, temporarily preserving their student status and remaining under school supervision. Therefore, since the 10th, all students have resumed classes as usual, and the disturbance has been resolved. (Thin)</p>
<p>[Another report] Publicly funded students at the Zhejiang University main campus went on strike on the 17th to express their determination to the education authorities to "study in peace only after having enough to eat and wear." The school authorities, believing that the strike would cause serious damage to the students' studies, adopted a compromise solution, first borrowing and advancing meal expenses. The school immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that it increase the public funding待遇 in accordance with actual difficulties in order to adapt to current prices. The students expressed satisfaction and resumed classes on the 18th. (Butterfly)</p>
<h3>Beiyang College to Reopen in Tianjin in September</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] The post-school movement of Beiyang College has now made satisfactory progress.

<h3>Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Hebei-Rehe-Pingjin Branch Subsidizes Primary School Teachers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Hebei-Rehe-Pingjin Branch, considering the difficult lives of teachers in private primary schools, is providing a bag of flour to those with a monthly income of less than 50,000 yuan to show respect.</p>
<h3>University Professors and Primary School Teachers in This City Petition Minister Zhu; The Common Goal is to Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>[Report from this city] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education received representatives of Shanghai National University professors at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Shanghai Branch of the Three Youth League: Wang Lizhang from Fudan University, Ying Gongjiu, Zhu Fu; Gu Baochang from Tongji University; Miao Jie from Jinan University; Chen Shiying, Chen Daxie, Cao Hesun, Zhu Baiying, and Wang Dashi from Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>University Professors Petition</p>
<p>The conversation lasted two hours and yielded no results. Minister Zhu reported that the university faculty research fund has been changed from 500 yuan to 2,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan. This report was put on file in February, and has not yet been implemented. Therefore, it is in fact unrelated to the professors' request. Minister Zhu also stated that this small sum could not solve the problem, but was only a small gesture. The professors repeatedly proposed two reasonable principles for improving treatment, namely, first, professor treatment should be calculated according to a different standard, and second, the standard must link a portion of the new funds to the cost of living index. Minister Zhu only agreed to study and consider this, and the professor representatives asked Minister Zhu to submit the above principles to the government and do his best to fight for them.</p>
<p>University Students Petition</p>
<p>While Minister Zhu was meeting with the professor representatives, student representatives from Jiaotong University and the First Branch of Lin Da also led a group to petition at the site, asking Minister Zhu to promise to meet the professors' demands so that they could resume classes immediately and avoid wasting their studies. The students stood in the hot sun for several hours, but the minister did not come out to see them until the professor representatives left. It is reported that the entire faculty of Lin Da has telegraphed the Ministry of Education in response, also stating that if there is no satisfactory solution by the end of April, they will stop teaching on May 1 and resolutely demand practical and genuine improvements to their treatment. The main campus of Fudan University in Chongqing has sent a letter to Fudan University in Shanghai, stating that it has launched a response. The Shanghai National University professors' representatives, feeling that the requests yielded no results, plan to petition Chairman Chiang and prepare to go to Beijing to petition during the National Congress meeting to maintain the principle of education being paramount during the period of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Primary School Teachers Petition</p>
<p>[Another report] The Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Joint Training Association sent more than 300 representatives to the Academia Sinica yesterday morning to petition Minister Zhu. However, Minister Zhu was elsewhere, and Kuang Shujun and Chief He received them successively. The representatives immediately submitted a petition, requesting three points: (1) Following the example of municipal school teachers, private middle school teachers should be given a subsidy of 200,000 yuan per person, and primary school teachers 150,000 yuan per person. (2) There is no distinction between public and private teachers, and their treatment should be the same. (3) Increase the proportion of educational funding to 20% to 30%. Finally, Chief He announced to the crowd that he would be responsible for forwarding the requests to the municipal government no later than Monday morning, ordering the Municipal Education Bureau to handle them diligently. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed in an orderly manner.</p>

<h3>Sichuan University's Growth During the War of Resistance (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jing Ming</p>
<p>Since moving back to Chengdu, the professors and students of Sichuan University immediately became active, participating in various academic and political activities outside the school. At this time, Chengdu already had several universities, many of which were very famous in the country: There was West China Union University, Ginling Men's College, Ginling Women's College, Cheeloo University, and the Central University Medical School in the Huaxi area; Guanghua University in the west; and the later Yenching University and other schools in the city. In terms of scale, no school could compare with Sichuan University. Therefore, if there were matters of opposition and competition, the universities in Huaxi would unite to deal with Sichuan University; in matters of cooperation, Sichuan University, due to its national status, invariably stood in a leading position. From the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943] to the present, the number of departments and students has increased year by year. In the 33rd year [1944], a night school was established, specifically for out-of-school working youth. It was stipulated that students would complete the entire curriculum in five years. Night school graduates could be issued diplomas, which had been approved by the Ministry of Education. This was a bold attempt, but the results were not bad (previously, Soochow and Shanghai College also established night schools, but they were all missionary schools). In the 34th year [1945], the College of Science was renamed the College of Science and Engineering, and departments of Aeronautical Engineering and Hydraulic and Civil Engineering were added, as well as a second division of the Teachers College. Currently, the total number of students in the entire school is 3,640 at the main campus, and approximately 1,200 in the night school and preparatory courses, approaching a total of 5,000. In terms of the number of students, among all universities in the country, it is probably the largest, except for National Central University. The departments are: the College of Liberal Arts, with the departments of Chinese, Foreign Languages, and History and Geography; the College of Law, with the departments of Law, Political Science, and Economics, and a Judicial Group; the College of Science, with the departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, and Aeronautical Engineering, and a Chemistry Specialization Program; the College of Agriculture, with the departments of Agronomy, Forestry, Horticulture, Plant Pathology, Sericulture, Agricultural Economics, and Agricultural Chemistry; and the Teachers College, with the departments of Education, Public Training, Chinese Literature, English, History and Geography, Mathematics, and Physics and Chemistry (from this year onward, in addition to Education and Public Training, a Physical Education Department is also planned, and the remaining departments will be merged into the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences). The night school has three groups: Chinese, Law, and Commerce, as well as selected students in Education, English, and Journalism. In addition, there are the Liberal Arts Research Institute, the Science Research Institute, and the Second Division of the Teachers College.</p>
<p>Such a large-scale school with so many students will certainly have a significant impact on the future of Sichuan. According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's estimation in *China's Destiny*, Sichuan alone will need at least 50,000 specialized professionals with college degrees or above in the next ten years. If Sichuan University is to shoulder half of the responsibility for cultivating these talents, and given the current annual graduation rate of fewer than 500 people, it will take fifty years to cultivate them. Seen in this light, the future of Sichuan University is limitless!</p>
<p>But the problem is not that simple. From a qualitative perspective, today, not only Sichuan University, but no university in the country can be considered satisfactory. Lack of faculty, simple equipment, and insufficient funding – it is truly riddled with problems! In terms of facilities, Sichuan University has a good school environment. If the construction plan of the previous president could be realized, it could accommodate 10,000 students and cultivate an average of over 1,000 people each year. But this funding, calculated at current prices, is unknown how many hundreds of millions of yuan would be needed? Sichuan University, after all, did not suffer major damage from the war, but the so-called collection of 200,000 books are mostly old books from five years ago, and because they came from a combination of several schools, some are incomplete, some are redundant, and it is not easy to add to or supplement them. Sichuan University cannot be considered short of equipment, but most of it is already outdated. In the rapidly developing atomic age of science, to catch up with advanced countries, it is necessary to start almost from scratch. These problems are not unique to Sichuan University; they are common to all universities in the country, and the state needs to provide a comprehensive solution. Today, Sichuan University's only advantage is that while other schools are busy planning to move back and rebuild, it can start construction one or two years earlier.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Price Fluctuations Last Week Greatly Threaten People's Livelihood! Eliminating Speculation is Imperative!</h3>
<p>The commercial and financial situation in the city has recently been gradually getting on track. The price of gold has stabilized at around 1.6 million, and the price of rice has hovered around 25,000-26,000 for quite some time. The cotton cloth market has also not returned to its previous volatility. If efforts continue, the future is not without hope. However, a storm that had been brewing for many days suddenly erupted last week. Although the police have cracked down on the black market for public bonds, the price increase remains in effect. After rice loans were issued, the price of rice immediately soared by nearly 10,000. Merchants are unable to settle foreign exchange for prohibited imports, and they flock to the market to purchase US yarn, causing the US dollar to jump again. The price of gold also fluctuated accordingly. At the same time, tram, electricity, water, and train passenger and freight transport prices all increased during this period. Therefore, the prices, which seemed to be stabilizing, have once again stirred up huge waves. It is difficult to predict what the future holds. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Gold: The Central Bank's allocation has not been interrupted, and fluctuations last week were actually caused by speculators engaging in arbitrage. When the market opened on Monday, it was as high as 1.62 million, then fell back to 1.55 million. From Tuesday to Thursday, it fluctuated between 1.53 and 1.55 million. On Friday and Saturday, it rose again due to securities firms covering their positions and pawnshops making up for losses. The price rose from 1.55 million to 1.62 million. The final price at the end of the week was 1.575 million.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: US dollar trading was quite active. Although the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate remained unchanged at 2,020 yuan, there were many import merchants settling payments, coupled with the inflow and outflow of speculative funds, causing fluctuations in the middle of the week, especially on Friday and Saturday, which were the most profitable. The highest price reached 2,430 yuan, and the lowest was 2,080 yuan. The final price at the end of the week was 2,220 yuan. It is said that the Central Bank has not approved applications for large amounts of US dollars, but according to the Central Bank, legitimate merchant applications are always approved. It is also said that US exporters can use US dollars instead of US exchange, so importers of generally prohibited goods and speculators are engaging in large-scale activities in the market.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Due to extremely loose credit conditions, speculative funds are concentrating on unified public bonds, and the market is becoming feverish, with high prices emerging endlessly. At the beginning of the week, amid pervasive buying sentiment, Type C bonds jumped out of the 5,000 mark. Subsequently, due to artificial silk firms selling to take profits, the price retreated within the mark, but still rose by 560-570 yuan compared to the end of last week. Other bonds also saw advances. On Tuesday, the buying sentiment did not diminish. Type C bonds opened at 5,100 and went straight up to 5,350 yuan. At noon, retail investors sold and the price retreated by about 200 yuan, but other bonds were pulled up, and there were many transactions. On Wednesday, the price increase intensified. Retail investors and cotton yarn firms continued to push forward relentlessly, and the market became even more dazzling. Type C bonds even rose from 5,250 yuan to an unprecedented high of 5,500 yuan. Subsequently, due to active crackdowns by the police, the frenzy stopped abruptly. On Thursday, unified bonds only saw scattered transactions to cover short positions, and the price was called higher by several hundred yuan. On Friday, trading did not officially resume, and there were only some closing transactions. The asking price for Type C bonds once reached an unprecedented high of 5,700 yuan. The final price was reduced by more than 200 yuan. On the weekend, the black market for unified public bonds opened at 5,400 yuan, briefly retreated slightly, and finally closed flat. Other bonds each rose by about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Stocks: At the beginning of the week, domestic stocks first fell and then rose. Initially, they were thriving due to loose credit conditions. Subsequently, due to the property tax issue, people were weak and rushed to sell. Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk retreated to within 5,400. In the afternoon, large investors absorbed the selling, and the prices rebounded by more than 200 yuan. Three small stocks rose by varying amounts from 10 yuan to 30 yuan. Foreign stocks rose, with Jardine Matheson rising by 100-200 yuan, Wheelock Marden rising by 500 yuan, and China Paper and Jardine Matheson each rising by 200 yuan, and British American Tobacco closing flat due to rumors of the establishment of a sub-market and manipulation by British merchants. On Tuesday, domestic stock prices rose in the morning with retail investors absorbing, with Shanghai Yarn Factory rising to 5,200 yuan and Mayar Silk to 4,400 yuan. Subsequently, the bullish trend stopped due to selling. Buying sentiment was strong in the afternoon, and as a result, Shanghai Yarn Factory and King Fook Jewelry closed flat, while Mayar Silk rose by 80 yuan. Foreign stocks retreated due to selling. On Wednesday, domestic stocks were oversupplied, and the market was tired. The situation improved slightly in the afternoon, with Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk each falling by about 200 yuan. Foreign stocks rose and fell by varying amounts. On Thursday, domestic stocks continued to decline due to selling, with Shanghai Yarn Factory and Mayar Silk each falling by more than 100 yuan. Except for New Kwang, the three small hot stocks each fell by three to five yuan. Foreign stocks did not officially resume trading. On Friday, the domestic stock market was stagnant, and prices fell sharply due to large investors selling. Shanghai Yarn Factory retreated to 4,500 yuan, and King Fook Jewelry to 380-390 yuan. The situation stabilized in the afternoon. Foreign stocks continued to be closed. On the weekend, domestic stocks initially appeared weak, but then saw a rebound due to bullish traders absorbing at low prices. Foreign stocks mostly rose.</p>
<p>Food: At the beginning of the week, rice was actively bought and sold, but the market price jumped by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan due to deliberate price increases in the producing areas. Wheat flour also rose by 400-500 yuan due to large-scale purchases by Shantou firms. On Tuesday, rice prices were still fluctuating, rising again by 200-300 yuan to as much as 1,000 yuan. Wheat flour was in greater supply than demand, re-entering the 10,000 yuan mark. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans were stagnant, while peanuts were rare and rose sharply. On Wednesday, rice prices did not retreat due to sellers' support, with japonica and indica rice each rising by more than 3,000 yuan. Ying Yuan rose by 5,000 yuan, and Bai Yuan was even more popular, soaring by 7,000 yuan. Wheat flour rose in tandem. Among miscellaneous grains, only peanuts declined. On the fourth day, the upward trend of rice prices was still developing, with japonica and indica rising by 500 yuan, glutinous rice rising by 1,000 yuan, and wheat flour continuing to be popular at 150 yuan. Soybeans and peanuts both rose sharply. On Friday, there was a slight pullback, but Bai Yuan remained at a high peak. Wheat flour rose again by 200-300 yuan due to buying by northern firms. Soybeans fluctuated, and peanuts fell by 1,000 yuan. On the weekend, rice rose again by about 1,500 yuan, and wheat flour also saw a rise of 700 yuan. Except for Kaifeng peanuts, grain prices rose across the board.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn: In the past week, initially, due to the increasing inventory of raw yarn in Shanghai and the normal sales of raw yarn by merchants, the market was completely stagnant. Until the weekend, stimulated by the rising prices of US dollars and gold the previous day, and the long-dormant Tianjin firms suddenly began to purchase raw yarn, with demand from inland areas such as Beijing and Shanghai also being quite high. As a result, buyers on the market were eager, suddenly creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. The prices of 16s and 20s yarn rose the most. During the whole week, the highest price increase was 2.7 million for 60s yarn, and the lowest was 510,000 for 10s yarn. In terms of count, 32s Fairy Peach fine yarn rose by 280,000 compared to the previous weekend, the largest increase, followed by 16s Heavenly Horse and Bright each rising by 120,000, and 20s Special Double Horse rising by 75,000. Only 42s Blue Phoenix remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Because the peak season has passed, Shanghai has a large inventory, and merchants lack large-scale demand, the market lacks vitality. The prices of all brands were largely unchanged compared to the previous weekend, fluctuating by two or three thousand.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: It was initially weak and then firm. Manufacturers were increasingly watching and waiting. Subsequently, due to the rising US dollar, cotton merchants raised their prices. Most firms were forced to increase their orders, and as a result, the prices of all cotton types rose by two or three thousand yuan compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Fuel: As for other industries, they also mostly showed a firm trend. However, in the fuel industry, due to the supply of spot goods and the abundance of chips, the market was weak, and the prices of all goods were expected to decline. The price of Yangquan and Jiaozuo coal at the beginning of the week was 400,000 yuan per ton, and by the weekend it had fallen to 360,000 yuan. Pao Bao charcoal was especially unpopular, but the market price still hovered at a high peak of 9,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Commercial Loans Frozen in Hong Kong to be Returned by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] When Hong Kong was liberated, the Hong Kong military government handed over all enemy-related or pre-war warehouse goods, or factories and warehouses that had been controlled and used by the enemy, to the Hong Kong Property Control Officer for management and control. Merchants and civilians were allowed to collect documents and apply to the authorities to retrieve them. Merchants and civilians had submitted applications to the Property Control Bureau, but no news of a resolution had been received. It is reported that the authorities have continued to release the warehouse goods of these merchants. The Property Control Bureau has now begun processing these accumulated requests and expects that all of them can be returned to the merchants before the restoration of civil administration at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Unbearable Memories: Western Medicine Business in Shanghai Depressed After US Loans Arrived, Costs Too High, Wages Increased, Imitation Products Severely Affected</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Vitamin, sulfa drugs, DDT, penicillin and other preparations from American goods have recently become increasingly common in the windows of pharmacies and grocery stores in the city, and even on the stalls selling US military supplies on the street. In terms of price, they are five to ten times cheaper than similar domestic products, which is no longer a rare occurrence! "Cheap and good" is originally the golden rule for buyers to select goods. No wonder people are rushing to buy American Western medicines. The domestic new medicine industry, which once prospered, seems to have encountered a very serious misfortune.</p>
<p>Imitation Products are Not Bad: The reporter interviewed several leading figures in this field, and they all said in unison that although most of the above-mentioned new medicine preparations were gradually invented during this war, the Chinese people were determined not to fall behind and successfully imitated them one by one with the spirit of catching up. In terms of ingredients, except for penicillin, which is relatively inferior to foreign goods due to manufacturing equipment limitations, it can be said that none of the others cannot compete with foreign goods. However, Shanghai, which has always been known for its low labor costs, currently has an ordinary worker's salary of tens of thousands of yuan, or about sixty to seventy US dollars. The wages that senior technicians in the United States can earn each month are only slightly higher.</p>
<p>Wages Too High: But comparatively speaking, the United States makes full use of machines, and one worker's output can often equal the work of many workers in China. Therefore, the labor cost, which used to be an absolute advantage, has now become relatively inferior. In terms of raw materials, many of the basic raw materials for Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry are mostly pre-war inventory.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Too Expensive: These rare raw materials have either become the darlings of hoarders year after year, or have become the balls in the speculative market, and their prices have already been pushed to the peak. This is another fatal blow to the production cost of the domestic new medicine industry!</p>
<p>Speaking of the import of foreign Western medicine raw materials and finished medicines, because shipping has not yet returned to normal, there is only a small amount of imports. Therefore, a common 100,000-unit penicillin costs only four or five US dollars in the United States, but once it arrives in Shanghai, it costs more than 10,000 yuan in legal tender. This is clearly profiteering.</p>
<p>Foreign Loans are Much Cheaper: However, even at this price, it is enough to defeat the same domestic preparations with ease. If shipping becomes smooth in the future, and large quantities of orders pour in, and the exchange rate remains unchanged, then the future of the domestic new medicine industry is quite bleak! It is said that based on the reasonable price of American Western medicines in the future, at most it will only be enough to pay for labor costs in Shanghai, let alone other manufacturing costs! This is by no means an exaggerated pessimistic view, because according to statistics, there were more than 20 large chemical raw material factories and hundreds of small ones in Shanghai during the war.</p>
<p>Chinese Factories Have Closed: But now 90% of these factories have closed. The remaining ones are also hesitant and are thinking of changing their plans. General American chemical raw material factories produce ten to twenty tons of sulfa drugs per day, while Chinese factories still calculate daily production by the pound, which is a vast difference. Speaking of the city's domestic pharmaceutical factories, there are more than 50 large and small.</p>
<p>Living on Old Capital: But most of them are operating sluggishly, relying on selling inventory and living on old capital! The authorities of a large pharmaceutical factory in the city admitted frankly that their recent monthly turnover is not enough to cover half of their expenses, and their inventory is being sold at a loss. Looking back at the booming state of the domestic new medicine industry during the war, it is like another world!</p>
<p>Remedial Measures: Is the domestic new medicine industry hopeless? Not necessarily! Some people say that under the inability to compete on raw materials, should the principle be to make finished medicines domestically? This would require the government to slightly adjust the current tariff rates on Western medicine raw materials and finished medicines. It is said that the former was originally set at 25% and the latter at 30%, the difference between the two is too small. Can the import tariff rate on raw materials be lowered, while the import tariff rate on finished medicines is increased? Some people also say that the import of raw materials should be based on the principle of what the Chinese people cannot produce themselves. Still others argue that the government should provide strong support to the new industry in terms of funding, so as to purchase a large number of foreign equipment, and then use its own manpower and resources to manufacture the raw materials and finished medicines needed. These views all have their reasons and are worth providing as a reference for those who care about the future of the new medicine industry. At the same time, we must also recognize that in addition to its mission of serving patients, new medicine also occupies a pivotal position in national defense and military medicine. Only in this way do we feel even more that domestic new medicines are worth supporting and revitalizing. During the war, the booming parabola of Shanghai's domestic new medicine industry soared into the sky, but it was inevitably deformed and empty, so it could not withstand the attack of foreign waves, and the parabola immediately suffered a setback and plummeted. Needless to say, the foundation of the new medicine industry itself has its shortcomings. Some say that the vision is not far-reaching enough, some say that it is too focused on making profits, and some say that the quality of the products is relatively poor... Fortunately, we learn from one lesson and learn one trick, and the government's help is needed for the revival of the domestic new medicine industry, while its own redoubled enrichment and efforts are even more important! Otherwise, how can it resist the unabated giant waves? (Canglong)</p>
<h3>Cigarette Factories Still Issuing Loans, Cigarette Tax Adjustment Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>Regarding the cigarette industry in the city, it was previously reported that the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau was going to adjust the cigarette tax rate, so there was talk of cigarette factories adjusting new prices. It is now known that the authorities are still considering the cigarette tax rate, and the date of implementation has not been determined. Therefore, the old tax rate is still being levied in recent days. Recently, Yizhong Tobacco Company has shipped a large quantity of Great Britain Brand, Old Knife Brand, and Qinghai Brand cigarettes from Qingdao. These should have been subject to additional cigarette tax and temporarily not issued, but because the bureau has not yet issued a formal order, they have been issued as usual, and the price of cigarettes has not increased.</p>
<h3>Price Drop in Malaya Has Three Reasons</h3>
<p>[Malaya News] Commodity prices in Malaya have fluctuated greatly in the half year from last September to the present. In the early days of the British army's landing, commodity prices had returned to their pre-war state. Since last October, they have been rising straight back, reaching their peak between January and February of this year. Since February, they have been falling again, such as black market rice has fallen from 120 yuan per dan to about 35 yuan per dan. Grain has also fallen by an average of half. The reasons for the sharp drop in commodity prices are: (1) Factories have not resumed work, and many workers in various industries are unemployed, resulting in poor purchasing power. (2) Native products and medicine are exported, while foreign goods are imported in large quantities, absorbing a large amount of floating capital. (3) The implementation of rationing of flour, bread, meat, milk, and cigarettes from February has affected the decline in commodity prices. But the biggest reason is the lack of free trade, which has caused the stagnation of various production organizations in Malaya, resulting in paralysis of the market.</p>
<h3>30,000 Dan of Subsidized Salt at 14,215 Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Salt Affairs Branch of the city is implementing subsidized sales from now on in order to suppress food salt prices and supply the needs of the people. The price is 14,215 yuan per dan, and the quantity is 30,000 dan. The quantity purchased per household has not changed, and sales will continue until the quantity is exhausted. Those who need to purchase this subsidized salt can go directly to the branch office on Xinzha Road to go through the purchase procedures.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion on Golden Banknotes and Speculation</h3>
<p>Since the victory, US dollars have been highly sought after in the speculative market. Their speculation is so active that it surpasses silver dollars, and the rise and fall of their prices can determine the movement of silver dollars. This was especially evident in October and November of last year. However, after the government announced its intention to set the exchange rate, the status of the US dollar plummeted. This is because people were unsure whether US dollars could be settled in the future, so everyone rushed to sell them. In the previous period, US dollars determined the movement of silver dollars, but now the opposite is true, and the changes in silver dollars determine the changes in US dollars. Originally, the hedging ratio price of six hundred yuan for US dollars to ten taels of silver dollars was broken, once opening up to about eight hundred yuan. Since the announcement of the exchange rate in mid-March, with the exchange rate fixed at 2,020 yuan, the US dollar was sluggish in an environment of ample funds. At the same time, due to the Bank of China's allocation of silver dollars, speculators were unable to stir up trouble. Therefore, from the announcement of the exchange rate until the previous week, the US dollar never rose, and even fell to below 1,900 yuan at one point. However, since the previous week, the situation of the US dollar has been like a turn for the better. First, there were rumors that the US dollar exchange rate would be raised. Those with sensitive nerves believed that the US dollar exchange rate had a range of flexibility and that a raise was not impossible. Therefore, everyone absorbed it, and by the end of the previous week, it had rebounded to above 2,000 yuan. Since last week, the rumors of raising the US dollar exchange rate have remained strong, and the market has seen another rise. On the weekend, it rose to above 2,400 yuan, and US dollar speculation has returned to a fever pitch. The closeness of its hedging with silver dollars is also becoming increasingly significant, as follows:</p>
<p>Monday 756</p>
<p>Tuesday 743</p>
<p>Wednesday 741</p>
<p>Thursday 757</p>
<p>Friday 693</p>
<p>Saturday 709</p>
<p>(Note) Calculated based on the final closing selling price.</p>
<p>After this sudden activity of US dollars, the general hedging against silver dollars is still seen as roughly 600 yuan for ten taels. Whether this trend is possible is closely watched by the market. In terms of the current US dollar situation, the government is unlikely to raise the US dollar exchange rate, and in fact, it is not necessary. The main reason is that imported goods ordered by importers from overseas have continued to arrive at the port recently. Among these many orders, there are of course those that do not comply with import regulations. After arriving at the port, they must be settled, and if they cannot be obtained from the central government, they must search for US dollars on the market. Under the circumstances of real demand, coupled with the fueling of speculators, a momentum of advancing straight ahead has been created.</p>
<p>The general observation is that it may be possible for the hedging between US dollars and silver dollars to approach 600 yuan for ten taels in the process, because speculators have long known that it is difficult to retreat under the central bank's unlimited allocation of silver dollars. Observing the recent few times that 1.6 million yuan was penetrated, it did not move forward any further, which is a very clear example. However, when the golden banknote hedging reaches 600 yuan for ten taels, it is also very possible for speculators to see silver dollars as cheap, gather their strength to absorb them, break through the central bank's allocation price, and move upward.

<h3>Commodity Prices in Taiwan Province Are on Par with Shanghai, Merchants Complaining Endlessly</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Taiwan by Our Newspaper] General commodity prices here have maintained a balance with Shanghai. In the recent month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhaoshangju," "Ziyou," "Haiyu," "Haidi," "Haichen," and "Taipei" ships successively sailed to Taiwan, bringing in large quantities of supplies, especially flour. As imports exceeded demand, prices trended downward, falling from over 740 Taiwan dollars per bag to around 480 Taiwan dollars. Although prices have risen recently, they are still hovering up and down. White sugar is priced at 12 yuan per catty in the market and 9 yuan at wholesale. Cypress wood is priced at 900 to 1,200 yuan per stone (100 cubic feet). The price of gold is around 780 yuan per mace (calculated using the old scale at 80% purity). The price of rice has also fallen to 16 yuan per catty. As for other daily necessities, cigarettes from Shanghai such as "Zhonggaole" are priced at 30 yuan per pack. "Simaituo" shirts and cosmetics are not in demand. Most merchants from Shanghai are feeling overwhelmed, facing a dilemma. The price of goods is almost the same as in Shanghai. If they need to transport local specialties, there are no regular ships. Moreover, civil servants and the public in Taiwan are living in insecurity. The prospect of opening large-scale department stores and surplus food stores in this province is bleak. The attempt to transfer surplus funds to Taiwan to develop industry and commerce or set up factories cannot be implemented immediately due to the environment. Both material and spiritual losses are suffered. The prices of hardware such as copper, iron, aluminum, and sulfur are relatively low, and it seems that profits can be made, but they are listed as prohibited export items.</p>

<h3>Industrialization and Practical Science</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>As Professor Contiti of the University of California said, "China cannot be transformed into a mechanical industrial society overnight. If it could, it would be unfortunate; it is also unacceptable to believe that economic construction can be completed by simply transplanting a few Western mechanical secrets and tools." This sentence frankly reveals some of the maladies of China's industrial construction and the path that industrial construction should not take. It is truly a direct hit, and no one can deny its truth!</p>
<p>This means that we cannot achieve industrialization in a short period of time. We can use machinery to develop production, but this cannot be considered as having already industrialized or completed economic construction. Because, "mechanical secrets and tools are the tangible results of practical science after a long and painful process." Mechanical secrets and tools are built on the foundation of practical science. What kind of foundation there is can support what kind of building. The foundation is improving day by day, and the building is also expanding and updating day by day. The reason is very clear. Nowadays, practical science is progressing all the time, so mechanical secrets and tools are constantly being renewed. Even if we can find the mechanical secrets and tools, but without practical science as its foundation, it is really like a mirage, a soap bubble, temporarily producing a dazzling effect, but soon it will disappear! Therefore, true industrialization and practical science are related and inseparable.</p>
<p>In today's urgent task of nation-building, everyone is shouting for nation-building, and everything is competing for first place. In particular, "industrialization" is being shouted with a resounding voice, and it has attracted the most attention and interest from the people of the country. In order to seek rapid industrialization, many people are purchasing foreign machinery and foreign technology in large quantities. It is true that in the transitional period of China, obtaining this batch of machinery and technology for emergency use is not entirely unhelpful to the overall situation. However, the urgent task related to China's true industrialization is to develop science. We hope that the government can have facilities such as promoting science, increasing education funds, rewarding further study and research, and promoting expertise to "catch up," and we hope that the industrial community and enthusiastic industrialists can do their best to assist in achieving complete success.</p>
<h3>The Current Sericulture Industry</h3>
<p>— Ren Hengliang</p>
<p>Since Leizu invented sericulture, China has had a history of thousands of years. When the sea ban was lifted and trade between China and foreign countries was opened, silk suddenly became a major export product of China, comparable to tung oil and tea. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces relied on this as a sideline, and every year they recovered profits from overseas, I don't know how many. Afterwards, because the Chinese sericulture industry adhered to old methods, resulting in poor products, the overseas market was almost entirely seized by the late-rising Japan. Cocoon prices fell, the market slumped, and farmers' enthusiasm for raising silkworms was greatly reduced. However, because there was no other sideline to replace it, the rural areas were almost on the verge of bankruptcy, which worsened in 1931. Before the war, a small number of visionary people in the sericulture industry, such as engineer Zou Jingheng of Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory, repeatedly went to Japan to study and investigate. As the saying goes, "The stone of another mountain can be used to attack jade." Therefore, in 1936 and 1937, silk factories in Wuxi sprung up, mostly imitating the improved reeling methods of Japan. The products became increasingly refined, almost comparable to Japanese silk. Overseas credit became better day by day, silk cocoon prices rose step by step, and farmers' enthusiasm for raising silkworms revived, flourishing for a time, almost with a sign of revitalization.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders did everything they could to destroy China's sericulture industry. They established the so-called China Central Company, which controlled the purchase of cocoons at the lowest record ever seen. Farmers suffered heavy losses and had no choice but to flatten the mulberry fields and switch to planting rice and wheat. The machinery of various private silk factories was also dismantled and destroyed without exception. Since the victory, the government, recognizing the importance of sericulture in China's export position, established the China Sericulture Company by incorporating the enemy and puppet sericulture organizations that had been taken over, as well as silk and silk weaving factories, to support the development of China's sericulture industry. Private silk factories, such as Yongtai Silk Factory and Jiatai Silk Factory, silk industry giants in Wuxi, have also launched operations one after another. However, looking forward to the future of the silk industry, there are many crises and there is no room for optimism.</p>
<p>1. Nylon artificial silk invented in the United States has better tensile strength and uniformity than natural silk and has the potential to replace natural silk.</p>
<p>2. Most of the silk weaving machinery in the United States has been mostly converted into artificial silk fabric devices due to the impact of silk shortage during the war, so sales are becoming narrower day by day.</p>
<p>3. Silk from Italy and Japan are being sold at depreciated prices.</p>
<p>4. The current foreign exchange policy is unfavorable to exporters, so prices are falling.</p>
<p>5. The current silk price is about 2.5 million yuan per picul, but the fuel cost used in the manufacturing of each picul of silk is almost half the price of a picul of silk, not to mention that labor costs are high and manufacturers have no profit to make.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sericulture industry in the future should strive for improvement in both breeding and reeling. If it is stuck in the current methods, the entire sericulture industry is in danger of gradually declining.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Children's Toy Industry</h3>
<p>— Han Ming</p>
<p>Advocating for the children's toy industry may be criticized by some as a superfluous and boring thing. Indeed, at a time when the country is riddled with holes and construction is urgently needed, and the restoration and development of large industries such as transportation and production, and the solution and improvement of small issues such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation are countless and waiting to be addressed, the children's toy industry will naturally be forgotten! However, here, the author can point out two important points of the children's toy industry and prove that it is an indispensable undertaking.</p>
<p>(1) Modern children's toys are changing with each passing day with the development of science and the progress of material civilization, and they are becoming more and more meaningful and effective. For example, modern children's toys include models of airplanes, balloons, trains, ships, cars, cannons, etc. Airplanes and ships are also equipped with small engines. This kind of toy not only arouses children's great interest, but also makes them recognize and understand the general outline of modern advanced scientific machinery. In terms of education, it is really a great harvest! In addition, small bicycles, small leather balls, table tennis balls, badminton, and other toys for children can also enable children to achieve good results in terms of technology and physical fitness.</p>
<p>(2) Generally speaking, there are no children in the world who do not like toys. Therefore, except for those from very poor families, children are inseparable from toys all day long. Therefore, the number of children's toys in demand is really huge and considerable. In the past, the money that overflowed due to the dumping of Oriental children's toys was also shocking. Therefore, self-sufficiency in children's toys can be said to be a way to plug a leaky cup.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the lessons learned from this World War make us deeply admire the success of Germany's model education after World War I, which deepens our understanding of children's toys. The author believes that children's toys are not only used to amuse children to laugh and cry, or to exercise their bodies. Facts tell us that children's toys are also a kind of effective educational tool! Therefore, developing the children's toy industry is still worth advocating.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Mutual Commerce Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The Duration of Recession</p>
<p>Since the existence of a recession is a serious threat to general industry and commerce, the issue of how long the recession will last is something that every management personnel should study. This depends on the severity of the recession. If the causes of the recession include every point mentioned above, then the recovery period will take longer. If there is only one point, then the recovery period will be relatively shorter. We can list the symptoms that can be seen during a recession as follows:</p>
<p>1. The selling price of goods first has a sharp drop, followed by a slow price drop.</p>
<p>2. Production stops, causing many people to lose their jobs, or general industry and commerce implements layoffs and reductions.</p>
<p>3. The prices of various goods fluctuate, but gradually fall to a similar level.</p>
<p>4. The existing raw materials are gradually used up, replaced by newly imported raw materials, but at lower prices.</p>
<p>5. Due to the drop in goods prices, selling goods does not even have a profit or has only a very small profit.</p>
<p>6. Bank loans are reduced, and it feels difficult to pay many payable accounts.</p>
<p>7. The masses purchase at the lowest limit, creating a phenomenon of buying and using as they go.</p>
<p>8. Small-scale industrial and commercial businesses close down one after another because they cannot meet the conditions for survival.</p>
<p>To turn from a recession to prosperity, the following steps must be taken:</p>
<p>1. All inventory is slowly sold out.</p>
<p>2. All parties gradually feel the need for goods.</p>
<p>3. Because goods prices gradually stabilize, the public gradually begins to purchase larger quantities again.</p>
<p>4. The production volume of industry and commerce can gradually increase.</p>
<p>If the above steps are followed, then recovery will be relatively slow. Sometimes, due to the occurrence of special circumstances, recovery can be faster. These special circumstances may be particularly abundant agricultural harvests, large-scale construction plans by the government, or a large demand for products from abroad. With these extreme circumstances, funds can be quickly replenished, and then it can turn from recession to prosperity.</p>
