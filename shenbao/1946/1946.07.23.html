<h3 id="c1">馬帥自牯飛返首都携回政府意見書俞大維昨晚曾往訪晤 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺二十二日電〕馬歇爾特使今晨七時半自牯嶺下山，蔣主席特派黄仁霖總幹事送行，記者亦會隨同送至江邊，旋馬帥與隨行者渡江登機，時已九時半。據馬帥左右稱：馬帥此次在牯勾留八十五小時，其行館與主席行轅近在咫尺，幾乎無日不與王席保持接觸，對於政府之態度，已獲有深刻之新的認識。離山時笑容滿面，象徵此行已有重大收穫。據云，馬帥對中國和平前途，在下山時較上山時更具有堅定之信心。馬帥夫人仍留牯。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕馬歇爾特使今日上午十時半由牯嶺抵京，於外較塲機塲降落，隨行抵京者有皮參軍宗敢，美代辦施麥斯，及馬帥副官二人。馬帥下機後，急欲　車返行館，以避免與新聞記者接觸而爲記者羣所包圍。唯馬帥對記者所提出之各項問題，均不予置答。至於馬帥此來是否携有新的意見書等，馬帥亦拒不表示。唯據記者探悉：馬帥確自牯嶺　有一政府方面之意見書來京·馬帥抵京後即遄返行館休息，下午四時，司徒大使曾赴行館與馬帥晤談，五時左右，兪大維曾約訪，所談內容及是否有所商洽，兪氏拒絕答覆，僅稱一二日內邵力子先生或徐水昌將軍中之一人，必與馬帥會晤。據一般之觀測，此即象徵三人會議重將召開。聞徐水昌將軍約日內返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺二十二日電〕此間對時局之重要發展，寄希望於馬帥南京之行，因馬帥已將政府方面意見於今日携往南京也。聞政府方面意見仍本政治解決一貫方針。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕各方消息傳來，證明馬歇爾特使促成中國內部和平之偉大努力正趨失敗中。馬使倘不能達成其目的而歸國，亦不過證明其自始即担當一種幾不可能之任務，於馬使之偉大能力，並無影響，中國國共衝突，久已被消息靈通人士認爲殆無和解之可能，杜魯門總統要求馬使試行和解，證明總統非先對一種解決作直接巨大之努力，拒絕承認其不可能性。馬使之立即回國休息，極有可能。但馬使即使未成立協議而離去，並非美國對於促成中國國內外和平與安全，將停止努力之謂，杜魯門總統已任命司徒雷登爲駐華大使，司徒大使爲國共變方所歡迎，渠將繼續推行馬使所展開之工作云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕據消息靈通官方人士稱：馬歇爾促成中國和平之努力，目前所獲成就，與前數月相較，迄未有變動。另訊謂南京方面之外交及其他有資格人士方面咸信馬歇爾之努力，業已註定失敗，渠定於八月中句返美。惟據該方面稱：此訊尙未經此間接近馬歇爾將軍人士之證實。又據美官方消息靈通人士稱：外傅馬歇爾及其他美國官員已改變初衷云云，絕對不確。（請參閱第二版「美方考慮禁止軍火運華」消息）</p>
<h3 id="c2">談判之門未全閉前仍宜採政治途徑陳部長更正聯合社報導 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本巿訊〕記者昨日走訪中央組織部陳部長立夫，詢以周恩來氏對渠函請更正一節，已否答復？陳部長謂，未接復信。記者復以報載聯合社轉譯陳部長對南京中央日報記者之談話，內謂：周恩來在滬曾指陳部長共同主使昆明暗殺案，因詢陳部長是否周氏在滬曾作此言？陳氏答稱：余絕未對南京中央日報提及此語，廿一日之南京中央日報所載之新聞，亦無此語，且就余所知，周氏在滬，祗謂余在滬加强特務組織，佈置新暗殺，對此則余已去函抗議，觀聯合社該電最後一語「本人要求周恩來收回其在滬所稱本人與昆明政治暗殺有關等言，未獲答復。」可見聯合社實對此兩事誤爲一談。陳部長並謂：余日前在京並未接見中央日報記者，僅與該報友人略談共黨問題，該報所載談話內容，想係記者間接獲得，故與原意相差甚遠，復經聯合社電傳，更不相符，余當時謂處理政治問題，猶如治病，務採王道，毋用霸藥，故如內服之藥尙可將病治好，必不忍　施手術，本此認識，余對共黨問題，素主政治解決，回憶民國廿六年，余奉命興共黨作政治談判，共黨乃於九月間發表共赴國難之宣言，在該宣言中提供四項諾言，如信奉三民主義，服從蔣委員長之指揮，取消紅軍，取消蘇維埃等，此爲十六年以後本黨與共黨以政治談判解決問題之第一次，余對此項談判之成功，引爲生平一大快事，迄今猶以爲非至談判之門完全閉塞之時，本黨仍宜採取政治解決之方針，時該報友人詢以如事實證明，內服之藥確已不能治病，而用手術則尚有望，則爲良醫者，是否亦將動手術？余答曰然，譬如　腸炎，良醫必先用內服之藥，如證明其確將危及生命，自當施用手術，加以割治，此實萬不得已之事，自宜盡力避免，而在動手術之前，必先徵求病人家族之意見，決不操切從事，余對解決共黨問題之意見，不外如是，然自余之口，經該報之筆，間接寫來，復經聯合社譯爲英文，再轉譯爲中文，其間經過三道手續，故與原意自難免右所出人云。</p>

<p>孫夫人宋慶齡女士，昨日發表對當前時局的意見書，大意略謂：一目前的危機，不是在國共之間誰勝誰敗的問題。這是中國人民，以及他們的團結·解放·和生活的問題。應該權衡的，不是黨派的權利，而是人的權利。人民對於不斷繼續的談判，焦切盼望其能有若干結果，但每當一個停戰協議勉强達成之後，新的衝突又隨之而起。國共之間的談判，不能作最後之決定；最後決定必須屬於中國的人民。解決的方案縱使困難，却非常明白，那就是對於中山先生的三民主義——民族民權民生——加以正確的了解，及其在今日的正確實施。」她在意見書中繼續解釋三民主義在目前的意義。她以爲：「民族主義在今日的意義，是指中國不屬於國民黨，也不屬於共產黨，中國是一個國家，一個民族。我們必須有一個政府，包容全部人民所貢獻的各種意見。民權主義在今日的意義，是指國民黨的訓政時期已經過了，憲政時期必須開始。我國人民含辛茹苦，才達到這一階段，他們已證明應該有自治的權利。故「聯合政府」必須立即成立。各黨派必須選出他們自己的代表。國民黨的代表也必須由黨員選出。國民黨內有許多能幹而進步的黨員，一直沒有機會發言。現在是實踐民主以建立民主的時候了。代表從民主方式選出，他們即可進行制定憲法，這憲法將會得到人民的承認和批准。代表們必須在憲法中寫下，中國人民應有其不可缺少的基本自由。民生主義在今日是指人民不能再受飢餓，一方面讓貪官汚吏厚積財富，另方面使忠良官吏訴苦。土地問題必須合理解決。這並不是共產黨或外力的煽動，這是我們本身歷史邏輯發展的必然結果。一百年前，農民的騷動造成了太平天國的起事。人民有權利起來反抗飢餓。封建主義，與殖民地主義，這已是無可否認的事。「耕者有其田」，是中山先生的主張。這曾經在國民黨第一次全國代表大會中通過。這是救治中國飢荒的基本方案。把土地分配給耕者，這樣爲民生的打算，在全國各地都應加以考慮」她解釋了三民主義以後，從而指出「國民黨必須執行它的歷史任務，領導人民由民權政治，與土地改革，達到完全的解放。這一個使命如能完成，國民黨在任何「聯合政府」中，無疑的都會是領導的政黨。他將受到許多屬於其他黨派的人民的擁護，包括那些沒有軍隊因而在談判中也無力發言的政黨。」她在這意見書裏，最後提出她的要求兩項：「（一）要求中國國共兩大黨以及其他各黨各派的領袖，立即組成一個聯合政府。（二）要求美國友人，以停止一切軍火供應，祗允許把援助給與一個屬於中國人民的政府，來促成這一行動。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕周恩來昨晨九時許，偕其議員章文晋，中共代表成潤，伍雲甫等，同往「行總」，繼續就黃河工程問題，有所商談。善後救濟總署方面出席者有蔣廷　，「聯總」駐華辦事處代處長賴氏，副主任柏實思，農業工程專家葛禮恩等。會議空氣極為融洽，至十一時左右，即告圓滿結束。關於堵口工程，各方均同意採納美籍總工程師塔德之建議。</p>
<p>塔總認為值茲水漲之際，應竭力設法保持即成工程，以免前功盡棄。缺口之處，須築石　，以防水力完全沖入現漕，是項石　雖使黃水分別流入新舊道，但決不至危及沿舊道之居民。目前水漲，堵口工程不能進行，須俟陽歷九月中旬秋汎之後方能復工，現在應未雨綢繆，準備復工之一切物資器材，則堵口工程可能於今年年底完成至於八年來遷入舊道河漕內之居民，蔣署長允會同水利委員會薛主任委員呈請中央於四個月內（八月至十一月）至少撥款一百五十億元辦理救濟。此項賑款專為採運黃河舊漕共軍控制區所需物資之用，由中共會同行總支配辦理。會後將周兩氏論及將來共軍控制區之救濟問題，蔣署長表示行總願在共軍控制區多設辦事處，以利工作。（按現已有兩辦事處，一在烟台，一在菏澤）。並願組織一調查委員會，由聯總·行總·中共三方面派人組成，進行調查共軍控制區人民之實際需要。此次會談，已獲具體協議，關於嗣後日常公事之往返，周氏指派伍雲甫君爲中共代表，担任中共與行總之聯總工作。蔣署長允予伍氏以上工作上之便利。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十一日電〕聯合社今日得悉，美國高級官員正在考慮完全禁止軍火軍器運往中國，希望藉此促成美國襄助統一中國之舉。又據深知馬帥及其在華任務者稱，馬帥一日覺得仍能有助於推行政府政策，自當一日留在中國，以冀實現中國團結之最後希望，所有斡旋和平之種種努力如全部失敗，則馬帥自將轉而襄助重新確定美國對華政策。華盛頓官方大致係在絕望情緒之中始考慮禁止軍火軍器運華問題。此項軍備租借法項下之物資，戰爭期內一直供給國民政府，即在對日勝利日之後，亦繼續接濟，俾國軍得以襄助中國境內日軍敗兵繳械及敢復失地事宜。及至最近此種接濟之目的則欲堅強中國使成為亞洲方面一種力量。中國所接獲之此項物資，包括軍器在內，約值美金十五萬萬元以上。此種物資均歸　軍所有，惟共軍已自　軍在東北所留下之日軍配備爾獲甚多。華盛頓某某當局深　，　軍　滿不如此充分，則對美　　請與共產黨合作，或更能聽從。惟中共態度亦強硬，該黨若干極端份子聞亦主張武力解決。據此間外交政策官員稱：美國未便不敷而退出中國。聽任其自身打出出路，此其真正進退兩難之處。中國內戰對於美國外交政策，更將引起若干極其　妙之問題，即假令美國助國民政府，則蘇聯共將助共乎？假令美國不干涉，蘇聯及其他國家亦將照辦乎？美國對國共雙方不作左右袒，能使共衛突不使列強牽入漩渦乎？聯合國機構對於五大國中之一國發生內戰，能有所作為乎？</p>
<h3 id="c24">中共行動若合符節　全依據秘密決議　兩月來之事實可為證明 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>〔南京訊〕據民主社訊：國軍進入長春時，曾抄獲共黨中央政治局秘密決議文件，雖經共黨聲明否認，但東北保安司令部發言人，曾根據事實逐項加以駁正，證明共黨在軍事上政治上一切行動，與該項秘密決議，若合符節。記者頃再就此事，即詢政府負責方面意見，據稱：共黨最近兩個月以來之各種行動，更可證明係根據此項秘密決議案中第一項，爲軍事展開局部攻勢，地區在東北。自六月七日東北停戰令下達後，共黨仍在拉法一帶，繼續向國軍進攻，而東北其他各地共軍，攻勢迄未停止，哈爾濱以北共軍調動頻繁，大規模軍事行動，在積極準備中。近且將軍事攻勢擴大及於關內，如蘇，魯，豫，鄂，晋，冀，均發動攻勢。秘密決議案中，第二項爲絕對不在協商中與中國民黨解決問題，施用拖延政策，證此可以近月餘來，共黨代表與政府商談時，不肯解決問題，一味拖延，且不惜以實際軍事行動，妨碍商談之進行可以為證。秘密決議案中第三項，爲挑撥中美關係，七七共黨宣言，公開發動反美宣傳，近日又在秦皇島附近綁架美軍七名，均為共黨對美之挑釁行動。其他如共黨強指國民黨內部何人爲主　派，何人爲穩健派等，意圖分化，以及施用苦肉計，製造血案，嫁禍政府，激起人民不安等，無不與共黨中央政治局秘密決議案符舍。</p>

<h3 id="c28">打開軍事和政治的僵局 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>這幾天來，中國時局的演變，大概應到「窮則變，變則通」的階段了吧！一方面，蘇北共軍的蠢動，威脅着江南京滬沿綫的治安，激起國軍不得不採取自衛反擊的策略，而許多交通綫及經濟命脈所緊的區域，如何恢復秩序，使人民可以安居樂業，政府亦正在考慮採取適當的步驟。另一方面，馬帥和司徒大使上牯嶺，與蔣主席懇談，前昨已先後回京，外傳政府對政治解決的方針始終不改，並將主動實施，主席重申主張的文告日內可發，而司徒大使也說如大家共同努力，短期內必可使時局有所進展。大概政治僵局的打開，也很可能就在目前了。所以，儘管中共竭力向中外宣傳，「誇大」中國內戰形勢的嚴重，以致一部份神經過敏的美國人甚至考慮禁　軍火來華，而實際上無論就軍事看，就政治看，我們覺得這幾天的局勢，似乎已經從「拖」的方向賺到可望解決的方向。我們熱切期望這個趨勢的成熟，尤其祝禱這軍事和政治的僵局早一天打開好一天。</p>
<p>本報早就主張，國家大局今天絕不能再「拖」，拖就是禍國，拖就是殃民。老百姓的共同目標很簡單，只有和平二字，而實現和平的方法，根本只有「軍隊國家化」「政治民主化」十個大字，其他都是枝葉。</p>
<p>先說「軍隊國家化」。我們要求政府和共產黨，尤其是共產黨，必須認識國家至上的道理。尊重馬帥公允的意見，切實照着整編統編方案實行縮編部隊，而第一步就是立刻停止全面的軍事行動，將共軍從速移駐指定地區，聽候軍事三人小組的整編和統編。政府既然撤消了國軍裏面的國民黨黨部，那末只要共產黨能夠大澈大悟，放棄弄兵的觀念，也像其他黨派一般，做一個普通政黨，把軍隊統編爲國軍，換言之，「還軍於國」，則於共黨於國家都是大幸。胡適之先生去年給毛澤東先生的電報，苦勸共產黨的話，確是主張民主自由的人所共同要說的話。他以為只要共產黨放棄兵爭，從事政爭，未必不能如美國開國初期的民主黨以及英國在第一次世界大戰以後的工黨，也會有一天可能上台執政，但如果不改它弄兵的老調，無異自毀共黨的前途。所以今天軍事僵局的一個「結」，如何解得開，全看中共要人方寸之間的一轉念。只要他們願意解這個「結」，則軍隊真能國家化，一切事自可迎刃而解，真所謂一了百了。</p>
<p>共產黨也許要說：「（一）我們交出軍隊，爲什麽國民黨的軍隊不交出來？（二）我們交出了軍隊，國民黨將會「宰割」我們？」其實，這都是無意識的猜疑在作怪。第一點，國民黨今天早已沒有「黨軍」。我們今天政府所統率的軍隊都是國家的軍隊，而國軍部隊裏面的國民黨黨部也早在去年撤消，有目共覩。何況八年抗戰，將士流血，何可勝計，難道我們要偏愛國民黨，硬把這些衛國抗敵的國軍，都只算做國民黨的「黨軍」嗎？所以老實說，今天不奉國民政府軍令的軍隊，只有共軍了；也只有共黨應該立刻「還軍於國」。第二點，如果共軍編制爲國軍，國民黨就可「宰割」共黨，那更是奇談。政府果存此念，何必先改編共軍爲國軍、。且如此做法，必爲國人所不容。故共軍只要能心口如一，停止作戰，靜候統編，改為國軍，則軍事僵局必即可打開。</p>
<p>次說「政治民主化」。我們固然知道在共黨的「解放區」裏，一樣沒有民主自由，但無論如何我們先得要求國民政府，在其職權範圍以內，應儘可能的從速採取主動，實行政治協商會議的決議。因為政協會議在一月間開會，既然通過了五大方案，應該就是政府今後解決政治問題的大方針。政府只須力求這些方案的實施，不必徒費唇舌，再事協商。</p>
<p>第一，關於擴大政府組織，政府儘可主動的邀請國民黨以外人士共同參加國府委員會和行政院表示政府的開誠布公；至於各黨派及無黨派人士能來參加多少，那就要看他們的誠意了。我們相信，只要政府有此誠意，總有愛國的黨派人士和社會賢達願來參加政府，共同負責處理國事的。第二，關於國民大會，政府既決定本年十一月十二日召開，不再展期失信，那就應該積極準備一切以免臨時倉皇不及，同時並須多方和各黨派分別商洽，總期他們能相見以誠，開示代表名單，一方廣爲羅致社會賢達，或甚至使第四屆國民參政會的參政員都能參加制憲的國民大會，藉示政府嶄求集思廣益的精神。只要政府誠意尊重此國民大會，我們以為愛國的人士也願意來共同參加制憲的。第三，施政綱要領；第四，軍事問題。這兩方案，沒有什麽話再要說，政府已在逐步實行，只須今後更加努力，求其一一早日實現就得；但同時我們希望其他黨派（尤其共黨）也拿出誠意來，共同努力來實現它。第五，關顧憲法草案的修正，我們希望憲草審議委員會從速根據</p>
<p>協商會議的修改原則和國民黨六屆三中全會的決議，雙方參酌；針對國家現狀，妥擬方案，以備提供國民大會的採納。但我們於此，應有一共同了解，即國民大會自身具有制憲的最高權力，任何黨派，任何個人，或任何會議均不能有拘束國民大會的權力。</p>
<p>我們以為：今天政府最大的錯誤，就是忽略了政府對於解決當前政治問題自己應負的責任。一個政府，不像一個在野的黨派，可以徒唱高調而不實行。政府對國家，對人民，是要負責任的。所謂「政治解決」，應該不僅是指的「談判解決」，而是指的政府用政治上的實際辦法來解決。只要國民政府在實質上，的確趕快擴大政府的民主基礎，的確誠意召開全國性而非黨派性的國民大會，的確執行政協協議的施政綱領，的確實行整軍方案，的確慎重協議修改憲草，那末，我們料想沒有偏見的國民，一定會擁護政府，沒有惡意的黨派，也一定會參加政府，共同担任治理國家的責任的。打開政治僵局的關鍵，就要看政府有否主動的決心。而我們預料政府當局，此時當已面臨着必須拿出決心的階段了。</p>
<p>「山窮水盡疑無路；柳暗花明又一村」。我們希望中國目前的政局也是如此，僵局打開，豁然開朗！</p>

<p>張北縣事件</p>
<p>民國廿四年六月，日軍將校兩人，下士二人，由多倫赴張家口，行經張北縣時，不受該地北城門駐軍檢查，亦未携带通行證，遂起爭執。當時縣城駐軍將該四百人，帶往張北城內百三十二師趟登禹師長司令部。趙師長即向廿九軍軍長宋哲元將軍請示後，允該日本軍人經張北赴張家口，但言明今後必須携带護照。該日本人等乃經由張家口赴北平。及該日人通過後，駐張家口日領事橋本忽提抗議，謂「日軍將校等於張北縣北城門遭駐軍檢查，被帶往師司令部扣留，此事誨　日軍人，要求加以懲罰。陳謝，及保證將來不再發生同樣事件」等語，繼又謂「領事無交涉權，此事已移交天津日駐屯軍辦理，請與駐屯軍代表土肥原賢二少將交涉。」交涉結果：張北縣駐軍所屬團長懲戒免職，扣留日將校之百三十二師司令部軍法處長亦懲戒免職，中國以後不得在察北活動，取締察省排日機關及　日行為。中國政府爲冀求和平，一再讓步，然日軍閥之侵略，無有止境。日本駐華大使館武官高橋坦雖曾參加上述交涉，然實際處理者係土肥原賢二。</p>
<p>冀察政委會</p>
<p>冀察政務委員會成立前後之收買工作及脅迫。民廿四年九月，宋哲元將軍任平津　備司令時，土肥原在平策動樹立華北政府，使華北脫離中央。其誘惑方法爲（一）以宋哲元爲華北自治政府主席。（二）關於華北之軍事經濟，日方盡力援助。（以上兩點由土肥原向平津市長　振　提出，但遭我方拒絕。）後中央任命宋哲元將軍爲冀察政務委會委員長，均秉承中央意旨辦理。關於國民大會之選舉及大學生之集體軍事訓練，當時日方表示不滿。日本知誘惑工作失敗後，即轉為脅迫；（甲）政治關係：一·要求宋哲元將軍通電宣佈華北自治政府成立。二·撤退北平中央情報人員。三·統制平津之言論，不得反對自治，（乙）經濟關係：一·建設津石鐵璐，二·改訂天津關稅，增加對歐美貨物之稅率，減低對日貨之稅率。（以上兩項爲我方所拒絕。）（丙）軍事關係：民廿五年九月之豐台事件。事件起因，係日軍一中隊在　台演習時，欲通過我軍防綫，我守軍企圖阻止，遂發生衝突，事件雖皙獲解決，然日軍藉口增加駐屯軍兵力爲六大隊。其次事件爲退役大將松井石根於民廿四年秋在平提倡大東亞協會支部，晤見宋將軍及余。宋將軍及余對此表示不贊成。松井主張亞洲應為亞洲人之亞洲，歐美勢力應予排斥。余笑謂亞洲人之亞洲恐成為日本人之亞洲，如真求平等互惠，應先談其他問題。</p>
<p>盧溝橋事變</p>
<p>秦氏之第二陳述書詳細七七事變經過稱：事變前担任華北察省政治責任之機關爲冀察政務委員會，委員長爲宋哲元將軍，日敵於九一八侵略我東北三省後，繼即進窺熱河，收華北各地於掌中，平津間之鐵路遂成為第一綫。我軍以二十九軍為主，在華北察哈爾，平津各地交戰。七七事變之發生地點爲盧溝橋，在北平西南二十華里處，係平西要働。此乃日侵華之第二階段。其時在民廿四年夏至廿六年春間，敵人見政治攻勢及經濟獨占均不得逞，乃決定使用武力脅迫。廿六年七月七日夜十二時十分，余接冀察外交委會之報告，轉告日特務機關長松井之電話，調日陸軍一中隊刻在盧溝橋附近從軍三十七師所屬部隊射擊，演習部隊一時陷於混亂，點名結果，兵士一名失踪，故日軍今夜將入城檢查，此事如何應付，以電話請示等語。余答謂日軍任意在我領土內演習，達返國際法，事前既無任何通知，我亦未作任何許可，，故即令兵士一名失踪，我方並無責任，如兵士確實失踪，即刻令盧溝橋駐軍會同地方警察搜索。日軍仍強硬要求入城，並決定不獲許可，即使用兵力圍城。其後余訊問咋夜日軍有無演習，答謂並未演習。此時日軍由三方两將宛平城包圍。六时許，敵人用機關槍射擊城內，逐步迫近，中日戰争於焉開始。八，九兩日戰鬥甚烈，，敵军死傷甚衆。敵見戰况不利，九日遂派松井等来求交涉，謂失踪兵士業已尋獲，可和平解決。於是立即開始商谈，结果决定如下三项：（一）雙方立即停止戰鬥，（二）雙方軍隊撇至原來防地（三）盧溝橋及宛平城守軍改由其他部隊代替，並加附屬協定，故今後不得發生同樣事件。然日軍以該條項爲緩兵之計。乘機抽調關東來平津作戰。十四日雙方復戰，戰况愈益激烈。此即盧溝橋事變之經過及交戰情形。發動事變之敵軍主要軍官係天津駐屯軍司令官香月清司，旅團長川邊，聯隊長牟田口廉也，駐屯軍參謀長酒井隆。又事變當時之參謀長係橋本，然最初領導占領華北者，乃發動九一八事變之土肥原賢二人。陳述書宣讀後，當由辯護人向秦氏作反訊問。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社阿根廷京城廿一日電〕據玻利維亞京城電台廣播：玻國暴力革命成功，前總統維拉洛爾遇刺後，夏凡慈上校已就任總統職務。另據其他消息，此次革命乃人民黨領導，維拉洛爾係被學生暗殺。先是維拉洛爾總統向反政府示威運動之茲衆勸告，突遭槍擊，身受重傷，即被衛隊移入總統府。但暴徒旋即進攻總統府，將門首衛兵繳械，搗毀客慶門窗，其時總統躺於廳內，輾轉呻吟，暴徒將受傷之總統抬至窗上，向街上擲去，實際將其撕裂。屍體旋裝入卡車，通過京城各街道，直至市中心廣場，將屍體縛於燈桿上群衆則圍繞歡呼。按維拉洛爾於一九四三年十二月二十日革命後上台。渠領導青年軍官運動，與國民革命運動合作。六個月後，其組織之政府即被美國及拉丁美洲十九個國家承認，但各國均認為該一政府有法西斯色彩。維拉洛爾則努力表示其真誠參加聯合國之作戰努力，在政治方面反對左派各黨，該黨被排斥於國會之外，黨員常受粗暴壓迫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕周恩來夫人鄧穎超，因共產黨員譚壯及陳靈鳳，於二十日下午外出，夜未歸寓，疑生意外，曾於前晨十一時以電話致吳市長，略稱譚陳突然失蹤，恐係遭政府拘捕，請速查明釋放等語。吳市長當即告以所云政府拘捕一節，必非事實，但允代為嚴密查訪，隨即令筋警察局實行追查，至當日（廿一日）下午四時許，警局已獲悉譚陳二人已安全返寓，乃據以報告吳市長，再由吳市長電詢鄧氏，然鄧氏未曾予以證實，警局爲慎重起見，乃先以電話詢問，證實譚陳確已返寓，然後警局再派員前往查詢經過情形，據稱純爲自行外出訪友，並無他故，因當日在友處住宿一夜，故釀成此次誤會云。按譚壯爲廣東人，三十四歲，爲延安和平醫院外科主任醫師，陳靈鳳係湖南長沙人，三十歲，爲延安實騐農場場長。彼等係六月初自延安啟程，至六月二十九日抵滬，均將出國赴美考察。而譚陳二人，來滬多日，迄未報戶口，警局以滬市區域遼闊，政黨團體錯綜複雜，保護難周，故已由吳市長轉知共黨方面，照章申報戶口云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民國廿六年間，景福衫襪廠在打浦橋徐家滙創立時，只是幾個人的合夥組織，資力既小，範圍也窄，經主任徐文照君的多年苦幹，逐步向前邁進，從合夥到股份有限公司，從偽中儲券一千五百萬元的資本，膨脹到目前法幣二萬萬元的資本，景福的股票，正是今日股市三小熱門股之一！</p>
<p>昨天記者承景福衫襪廠的　邀，實地觀察了他們結晶品之一－二廠，二廠是座簇新的建築，佔地約十畝，男女工人一共三百餘人，技術工人也有五十餘人。踏進廠房，耳朵就被隆隆的機車聲所籠罩了！據說：針織部的設備，有湯姆金棉毛衫汗衫，和衛生衫針織母機共卅九台。各式縫紉機八十台。羅紋車十二台。梭織布的設備有豐田式織布機四十台。漂染部有漂染機器和烘間全部。整理部有拉毛機和軋光機各二部。爲了補充電力的不足，他們也裝有柴油引擎的發電設備。</p>
<p>景福目前主要的產品是飛馬牌汗衫，棉毛衫，衛生衫，針織內衣，和綫呢細布等。據說：針織品每月可出一萬餘打，綫呢和細布約三千疋。產品的十分之七，是行銷本市其餘十分之三，分銷昆·渝·蓉·津·港等地。</p>

<p>證交市塲內部設備佈置等事宜，刻在積極推進中。舊證交巿塲中一切不適用之裝置，現已拆卸殆盡。隔層地面，亦已動工，翻拆另舖。至隔層中房客廿餘家，亦將於一二日內遷至同厦入樓。證交原有三樓辦公室，刻亦積極佈置。至證交內部事務上應準備之工作，例如各項帳表，格式，單據等印刷品，亦在積極趕辦。聞將來市塲中將裝置報吿行巿之擴音機，各經紀人處均將另有擴音機直接與市塲聯絡，故各種行市，隨時可報達各經紀人處。又每一經紀人，均將配給與巿塲直接對講之電話綫一綫，以利交易進行。現聞江西路上海電話公司之舖綫事宜，已舖至漢口路河南路口云。</p>
<p>經紀資格初步審查</p>
<p>上海證券市塲籌委會審查經紀人資格小組會委員三人，自昨日上午九時起，開始將經紀人申請書六百餘份，逐份啓封，作初步之審查。工作竟日，迄下午六時許止，啓封之份數，僅及總數六分之一。今日下午二時卅分起，將繼續啓封。預計該項初步之審查工作，約可於三四日內竟事。然後將提交全體　委會復查。預計全部經耙人資格審核完畢，爲時尙需三週。</p>
<p>兩種資格各有優點</p>
<p>據悉：此次證交收到之六百餘份經紀人申請書，銀行及信託公司等，約佔一百餘家·蓋按諸規定。銀行信託公司等申請爲經紀人者，至少須在上海市區營業滿五年以上。故對新設銀行，不無限制。記者旋以銀行信託公司之申請爲經紀人者，資力信譽，必較諸個人者爲佳，將來或將影饗個人之營業等一情，詢諸關係方面。承吿：此一事亦未必盡然。蓋客戶委託銀行一信託公司等買賣證券，常須塡具委託書，一切手續均按步就班，比較繁瑣。個人經紀人即比較遷就。故兩者營業實各有千秋，未能執一而論。</p>
<p>外商外股申請不多</p>
<p>舊衆業公所各經紀人，華籍會員四十二家中，大部均已申請爲證交之經紀人。至外商會員五十八家中，前來申請爲紀人者，尙佔少數。外股之前來索取上市申請書者亦尠。蓋聞大部外股，近方開始登記，以便整理。預計整理完畢之期，至少需六個月云。上市證券之申請書，迄目前爲止，已送出一百另六份。惟以須塡資料頗爲　複故迄未見有塡就送還者。</p>
<p>原有證交或將改名</p>
<p>據悉：原來之華商證劵交易所，擬於最近期內，召開全體理監事聯席會議，以便討論改組及召集股東大會事項。聞其名義，將改爲華商投資公司，緣新證交資本十萬萬元，老證交將以集團姿態加入，約佔總資本額之六成云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕停開業已五日之糧價審議委員會，昨日下午三時在社會局開會，出席者有社會局吉課長，市商會錢興中，上海總倉庫趙行絜，米號業張錫潮胡咸鋼，米行業蔡聲明，殷福祥等，當以近日川贛常錫等地食米及洋米源源運來，本市糧食日見充實，巿塲價格下趨，故評議結果，將各種食米價格再略予减低。</p>
<p>種類　議定價目</p>
<p>白粳薄稻　六萬四千元</p>
<p>羊秈　六萬三千元</p>
<p>埠尖　五萬八千元</p>
<p>碾尖　五萬三千元</p>
<p>白尖　五萬元</p>
<p>米店出售，按上開價目加棧下力外，另加合法利潤百分之六，如白粳薄稻一項，合零售價格爲六萬九千五百元，自今日起，米行號業出售食米，俱不得超越此新議價。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本巿糧商前爲領售川贛糙米，資金無法流轉，向巿府請求脫售後還款，經吳巿長允諾後，命先辦理三家米號聯保手續，以資保證。詎知米行號業迄今尙未前往清理，昨據社會局糧食課吉課長向記者稱「頃奉吳巿長命，若各該米行號業在三日內再不到局辦理該項手續者，將立即吊銷其營業執照」云云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕浦東新糙，第一枇昨已登塲應市，開價四萬四千元，嗣後將源源而來。昨日南北巿塲共到粳秈元米一萬三四千石，消化呆滯，高貨小一二千元，中下等粳尖狂跌三四千元，白元亦跌一二三千元，麵粉疲削，油價堅挺一，豆餅再小一二百元，蠺豆續小一五六百元，惟生仁貨稀，價漲二三千元小麥各埠散戶消化轉殷，價漲七八百元。</p>

<p>昨日紗巿欲漾無力，紗廠產量雖因停電而減遜，同行心思殊高，奈實需不濟，是以　馬晨初一度出一四〇關，旋又於收市時回到一三八萬，中小型紗亦平庸之至，大致與上週末行巿無甚軒輊，獨廿支筒子紗因有某大單純織廠大量吸收，價漲起四萬之　，午時紡建照例開紗，廿支有寶光日光供售，價與巿塲價相仿。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况繼續堅挺，緣美棉易漲難跌，滬埠存底逐漸枯涸，執有現貨，猶在望高，奄無貶售態度，以致買賣兩方談判不易接近，廠家全無做開，僅花號稍有點綴，美棉因星六停市，無電</p>

<p>本市各同業公會，因目前工商業危機重重，特邀集會員經多日之硏討，建議辦法四項，函請巿商會核議，並速分呈中央各機關採納施行，茲摘錄其建議四項如次：</p>
<p>（一）加強銀行專業化</p>
<p>查中中交農四行各有其歷史與任務，爲適應戰時之需要，遂有四聯總處之設立，然該處不僅割裂財政部與中央銀行之職權，且至銀行衙門化，目前政府雖規定專業銀行之資金，運用於專業範圍，不得少於百分之五十，但又限制三千萬元以上之放款，例須經過四聯總處往返數月之審議，而農工商待款之迫切，何能從容若是，故四聯總處，實必亟先撤銷，又中央銀行必須履行銀行之銀行的職責，辦理重貼現與轉抵押業務，同時解除收縮行莊頭襯之錯覺，减低存款準備金定率，並加以活用。</p>
<p>（二）速辦生產貸欵</p>
<p>過去政府對工貸之總數，因一味醉心於緊縮，僅佔歲出百分之二，實屬重大錯誤，吾國農業經積年兵　，亟待救濟，應由農民銀行亟起辦理貸款救濟，工貸條件，須硏究各廠實情，給予其必需之全部資金，担保品除廠房機器生財以外，可採取同業聯合承兌制，原料與製成品，不宜使之凍結。</p>
<p>（三）實行進出口連鎖制度</p>
<p>並補貼出口，如採取低利之出口貸款，减免運費關稅或現金補助等辦法，採用是項制度，規定商人以採辦土貨之出口外匯，抵銷其進口外匯之需要，在金額上予以連鎖，或依種類上予以連鎖，如輸入棉紗者，必須對外輸出其製成品棉紗或布疋，抵銷其進口之外滙，使出口貿易，依賴進口貿易而生存。</p>
<p>（四）組織復興實業投資公司</p>
<p>公司之資本爲美金二十億元，由民間投資四分之一，向華僑及一友邦人士招募四分之三，並規定我國之在美資金三億元美元，得准投充爲公司之資本，從海外購置新式機器，投放於國內工廠作爲股東，使國內民族工業之基礎，日臻充實。</p>

<h3 id="c120">烽烟處處　杭綢北銷無望 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 七月十三日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州綢廠女工生活　（孫紹軒攝）</p>
<p>浙江綢是馳名國內的，其實浙江產綢最多的地方，僅爲杭州，吳興，紹典，三地，我們所知逍的杭紡，湖縐和紹紡，都是上述三地的特產綢料。三地之中，尤以杭州產鋼最多，即遠在西南山國，也不能例外，且爲全國人民所愛用愛穿。</p>
<p>浙綢最大的銷路，在華北與東北一帶。華北北平爲以往京都所在，文士衆多，愛穿舒適自由的服飾，浙綢質地柔和，穿在身上輕鬆愉快，於是便被採用。並且北國早寒，人們愛穿絲綿的衣服，這絲綿惟有用浙綢做面作裏，始不會竄出衣面之外，否則，一個個白的絲棉頭，都會流在衣服的面上，多少是不很雅觀的。</p>
<p>我們國家一向對數字不太重視，所以浙綢北銷的精確數字也沒有可靠的統計。大概估計一下，北銷常在全產量百分之三十以上，外銷數量則殊不可攷。</p>
<p>多事之秋無人問津</p>
<p>在抗戰時期，杭，吳，紹，先後淪在敵人手裏，織綢的常然銳减了。抗戰勝利後，綢業界很想振起精神，好好地幹一番，無如牟年多以來，東北與華北因爲共軍的間題，沒有人再來問浙綢的價格。外國的各種衣料，將要源源來到，好貪便宜，又好時髦的人，當然不願意再要買杭綢了。因爲銷路的呆滯，而生活程度却日就高漲，成本一天天的加高，於是生意就更加淸淡了。現在，綢業界天天呌苦，他們緬懷以往的盛景，而遭過着現在的苦境，雖然對將來有無限憧憬，但也覺得毫無把握。</p>
<p>農村經濟蒙受苦厄</p>
<p>綢業界的不景氣，也影響到整個杭嘉湖以及浙江養蠶縣份的蠶汎，因爲好蠢收穫的好絲，當然可以行銷國外，但是次蠶所獲的次號絲，可以在自己國裏作綢自用。現在結業界嘆苦，許多綢機不活動，蠺絲也就沒有了出路，蠶農也呌苦連天。所以浙江的綢業，實在也影響着農村的經濟的</p>
<p>多數婦女生計堪虞</p>
<p>到底戰前和戰後的產品數量上减少多少？據杭州市的絲織業狀况調查所得，織綢機在戰前電機有六千二百餘台，手織機有八千五百餘合，僱用工人約二萬二千人，每月產量約十萬疋左右。現在電機僅有三千三百餘台，手織機僅有二千二百餘台，工人僅有八千多人，每月產量僅有三萬四千餘疋。則電機戰前爲二分之一弱，手織機較戰前爲四分之一弱，工人較戰前爲三分之一弱，產量較戰前爲三分之一。中數平均都較戰前减低三分之二。尤其値得注意的，即手織綢减少了四分之三，這許多手織綢往往是農村中的女子，或是想向上的婦女，她們依此爲生的，現在减少了這許多的機會，這許多婦女將成爲社會上的消耗者了。</p>
<p>其他如紹興地方，電機至今還沒有恢復。吳興聽說僅恢復了一部份，但手織機都普遍的减少。</p>
<p>三份之二工人失業</p>
<p>我們僅就杭州巿的綢業數字觀之，知道織綢工人已减少三分之二，其實這三分之二織綢工人的失業，不單是一萬四千多人的饑饉恐懼，而要影響到他們每個人的一家大小，更影響到整個的社會。紹興，吳興何嘗不是如此呢？這廣大的失業工人，這被影響的農村經濟，將何以善其後呢？現在杭州市綢業界中人大概都是請求貸款，但貸款是不是辦法，顯然是一個問題。</p>
<p>改良花式織造新綢</p>
<p>我認爲最緊要的莫如改良花式，製作新綢，以與外來品競爭，這實在是最積極的辦法，因爲如果我們借一些款子來，拖一拖下去，則會愈拖愈深的。倘使我們抱定決心改良絲綢，則其借款也有前途。</p>
<p>其次，我們抱定樂觀的心理，即是國家的混亂局面，總有一夭會澄淸。待澄淸之日，華北與東北的巿塲還是要爭回來的。因此，我們在此時，不妨仍舊繼續生產，以維工人的生計。</p>
<p>再次，我們可以有理由作外銷的準備。只要改良品質，硏究歡美人的心理，來努力宣傳。努力製造，則外銷巿傷，也不是沒有希望的。</p>
<p>不過，解決眼前這個重大的難關，尙有待於政府與人民的合另設法！</p>
<h3 id="c121">香港肅奸又一面 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十三日香港航訊　特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>上回通訊中說「奸者」因有叛對象的不同，便有各種的類別。由於國法的差異，則背叛中國的「漢奸」，朱必是背叛英國的「英奸」，而背叛英國的英奸，未必是背叛中國的「漢奸」。要是中英兩國沒有香港這條「轇轕未淸」的附帶，一居遠東，一在西歐，則漢奸英奸，各管各的，毫無問題可發生出來。惟是香港在二次大戰中，經已劃入中國戰區，而重入香港的英軍是奉我最高統帥蔣委員長的命令前往接受日軍投降的。戰後香港雖然再插上米字旗，但這塊殖民地已是一塊懸案未決的殖民地，面目逈非疇昔。粵港兩地，一衣帶水，一般漢奸利用不同的法律，紛紛逃匿香港，而香港原有的漢奸亦利用他們的「賣身投靠」技術，奉承英人，當作新歡，自嗚得意，肆無忌憚，於是引起了若干風波，其中尤以香港頭號文化漢奸岑逆維休的一慕，影饗最大。記者月來屢有報道，諒爲國內讀者所共悉。港府爲了珍重中英兩大民族的友誼，經已正式表示將盡極大努力協助我國引渡漢奸歸案。事前菲士延將軍，也和廣州行營商妥了交換漢奸戰犯的辦法。四月十六日那天，港府使用英海軍快　押解在港捕獲的漢奸三名赴擊，而由粵押回日本戰犯六名。</p>
<p>廣州行營蠢謀處處長李漢冲，曾與港府商訂互換漢奸戰犯協　，內容包括三點：（一）廣州行營及行營駐港聯絡專員爲主辦交涉逮捕及引渡漢奸之機關與人員；（二）凡屬中華民國人民，於廿六年七一月七日以後至卅四年八月十六日以前，所有觸犯中國懲治漢奸條例及違背國民公約之行爲者，均爲漢奸罪犯，由行營將其姓名。年齡·籍貫·犯罪經過等，通知港方，遵照逮捕；（三）在港漢奸罪行證實後，由港方逮捕，我方派員協助，但所提漢奸，每次如在廿名以內，港方當於一星期內遠捕，交由廣州行營所指定之人員引渡，解交中國法院審判。</p>
<p>據廣州行營發表第一第二兩批通緝漢奸名單後，據報載，匿港大小漢奸計有三百餘人之衆！單是文化漢奸一項，除一手操縱華僑日報的岑逆維休外，還有其他十二名·在此半年內，港府所提審的戰犯和附敵分子，已有五十四人，而所引渡的漢奸祇有敵偽時代廣州鴉片大王孔維新，敵偽著名特工陳才和偽保安司令部軍法處長陳幹三個。而明令通緝的漢奸，至今仍幾全數在港行動員由，逍遙法外。這個咎失應由何方負責？我當屬究何以　紀　，振人心？記者　提出來，促請臘人的注意！</p>

<p>— 秋平</p>
<p>這些日子裏，大家的心緒是煩躁的。「啓程歸國」四個字，不知提到過多少次，但是，眼看歸期愈近，各方面傳來延期的謠言亦愈多。這種不耐煩的等待，像一年前在川西候飛印度的心情是彷彿的。沒有出國時想出國，出了國就想回國，生活往往給矛盾所包圍着。終於，命令下來了。</p>
<p>四月四日，八艘中國軍艦舉行大檢閱。六日離關港回國，順道訪問古巴的桑地哥及哈瓦那兩地華僑。</p>
<p>從關港到桑城只有幾小時的航程，我們是升過旗啓椗的，在下午一時已經望見桑城的燈塔和港口斷垣數幢古舊的堡壘了。我們竚立在甲板上用望遠鏡眺覽這西班牙式建築的古城·這是個圍海港環立的古巴第二大城。</p>
<p>在港口，艦隊改變卸接隊形，由司令艦護航驅逐艦太康號率領，蜿蜓入港。埠上已經是人山人海，華僑社團都雇用小艇在港口迓迎。艇上用毛筆大字標着「歡迎中國艦隊」，艇裏搭滿了服裝整潔的華僑男女，男的向我們舉手致敬，女的迎風揮手。我們的手亦不歇地揮舞着在答禮。心裏充滿着興奮和愉快。我們沒有被遺忘呀！這是多麽親切的臉孔國着我們，向我們歡呼。</p>
<p>首先，司令艦嗚禮砲二十一響向古巴政府致敬，八艦魚貫靠埠停泊，接着桑城砲台回禮，夾着歡呼聲，激盪着，掩沒了加勒比海上節拍的浪濤。靑天白日滿地紅的旗幟迎風飄盪，沿着城坡岸到港面，處處飄揚！</p>
<p>靠埠放假是海軍慣例。剛是四點光景，街頸，冷飲店，俱樂部已滿是二三借遊的中國靑年海軍。白制服，藍被肩給中古世紀式的海島城市帶來不少光　的東方年靑的情調。華僑見了面，慈善地招呼着，親密地引導到各個華僑團體去參觀，受各方面的歡迎和招待，在情感上我們忘掉了是身處國外，我們獲得了溫暖和希冀，何况我們是從海上來的。在我同幾位士兵剛從埠上穿進市街，就被一羣古巴兒童包圍了，有的伸了手要美國香煙，有的討小錢，亦有遠遠地追隨着偷窺我們的福氣。當我們正不知該如何打發這羣孩童時，一位華僑過來向我們招呼，願意伴我們往各地遊覽。這種熱心可親的華僑，可以時常在街頭碰到。</p>
<p>可是問題發生了，這位華僑說廣東話，我們說國語。當我們試說英文時，他却說起西班牙文來了。</p>
<p>他引導着默默地穿過二道街，難題終於給長時間的沉默所打破，我們領悟到中國方言雖雜，但是文字却是統一的。於是我們開始筆談。在他筆談的大意中我們知道自從中國艦隊到關港接受備戰演習後，古巴各華僑社團紛紛電邀艦隊蒞訪，一面積極籌款歡迎，希望能够宣揚國戲，提高僑譽，古政府並定四月六日中國艦隊抵桑城日爲「中國友誼日」。</p>
<p>晚上國民黨部舉行向　蔣主席獻旗禮，由林指揮官接受代獻，禮畢，　即舉行跳舞會招待艦隊軍官。</p>
<p>士兵們在遊夜巿，餐館飲食店一有中國海軍的足跡，戲院百貨公司裏有中國海軍的足跡，今天是中國友誼日。今夜桑城是中國海軍之夜。</p>
<p>歸艦時已市上無人，滿街的中古國旗還靜靜地飄揚在夜色裏。一二黑人，尾隨窺語，替夜行人找尋歸宿，我知道桑城黑人甚多，且不時有劫掠事件發生，故直視邁步，未加理睬。到艦後，知道有位士兵的照相機被黑人所刧掠，雖經市警追捕，却未捉獲。</p>
<p>第二天七日是遊行桑城。晟九時，各艦派士兵三分之一，集合在海濱馬路，由桑城巿警隊和水警隊用摩托車前導開路，古巴海軍樂隊奏起樂曲，緩步在先，三百中國青年海軍循鼓起步，整齊漫長的行列，在人海裏，掌聲和歡呼中，巡行過古老的桑城街頭。我們的步伐是輕捷的，我們的胸脯是挺起的。像從疆場上退下來得勝的戰士，我們接受了無數尊敬和愛慕的眼光；像是出征臨別的子弟，接受了鄕里無涯的歡呼和深深的祝福。</p>
<p>遊行過後，我又同那位廣東同學鄧君往巿郊遊玩，拍了一些風景照和紀念碑留紀念。道過巿立醫院，被邀入內參觀，宏麗的建築，完善的設備，使我不能置信這樣一所該座落在紐約或者南京的醫院，却在古巴古老的桑城發現。後來一位醫生吿訴我，古巴以產糖著名，却很少有人知道古巴亦是一個醫學最發達的國家，在美國不少疾病，都是請古巴醫生飛去診治的。</p>
<p>在我們所到的地方，人們停住脚向我們注視，年育的中國兵，讚美和迓異不時加到我們身上。</p>
<p>顯然的道次海軍的訪問，給古巴人民對靑年中國的概念煥然一新，就是在遠離祖國久居海島的僑胞們，一日間能和數百來自祖國的靑年相會，亦歡喜得彷彿是在重溫童年舊夢了。</p>
<p>晚上，國民黨部舉行雞尾酒舞會，招待艦隊士兵，黨部座落在熱鬧的市心，燦耀的燈光，精緻的中古小國旗把它裝飾得像座富麗的仙宮，白禮服的華僑們忙碌殷勤地接待着，引坐，戲茶，年經的姑娘，在拋着微笑。這些將靑天白日滿地的旗幟從加勒比海上飄駛進桑港的中華靑年成爲被接待的高貴的賓客。</p>
<p>輕快的西班牙音樂從雙雙成舞的脚底下繚繞在靜的夜空裏，街頭有好奇的人們竚立着仰望。</p>
<p>中國人和中國人談話，竟要經過二重翻譯。桑城的華僑都是來古甚久，僅能說粵語和西班牙話，娶室多係古籍，同時因為環境不需要，所以其子女，連粵語都已經不會說了，因此，在這次舞會中，要和這些華僑姑娘談話時，第一得請華僑將西班牙文，　成粵語，然至由廣東　　將粵語翻爲普通話。</p>

<p>— 關榮欽</p>
<p>黑石鎭距樺甸城約摸九十里。七月三日午後，我們看到了。和橫道河子一樣，黑石鎭也是羣山叢中的一塊小平原，屬磐石縣。這個鎭本身沒有多少人家，可是仍不失爲週遭數十里的一個中心，也是磐石與樺甸間的一個要衝。聽說龍軍長來，遠至數十里外的鄕村父老都走來了。他們見到龍軍長，就提出好些請求；最迫切的是派隊伍保衛他們的村莊，或請發槍彈，以應付散匪。因爲由於散匪的侵擾，好些村民都痛苦地離開自己的莊園，流到他們沒有根基的地方去了。龍將軍都答應代爲設法，或轉達省方，不過要求地方把道路——尤其可以走車子的道路好好修築，使國軍能轉運靈活，迅速馳援。</p>
<p>七月四日，我們到磐石。看到磐石周圍的山峯上和道路要衝處站立着的碉堡，使「磐石」二字更能名實相符。駐在磐石的龍將軍部隊，出關之後，曾參與過收復渾河南岸·遼陽·蘇家屯·本溪·開原·西豐·伊通等地的戰役。首進永吉的也是他們。率領一營人沿吉長公路進入永吉的楊茂發團長我會到了。楊團長是廣東信宜人，才三十歲模樣，個于不高，可是眼很大，臉紅紅。他生動地給我講述佔領永吉的經過。他說進駐永吉前數天，進展很快，每天都行軍一百多里。五月廿八下午三時，從北門入城，經短時間的接戰，八路就狼狽地南潰了。楊團長在永吉百姓歡呼與慰勞中，迅速地佈置城防，約摸二三小時後，八十八師和四十一師也分別從東站和西門進城了，永吉城防就益見鞏固。</p>
<p>磐石全縣人口有二十六萬，城區的也有二萬多。八路撤退後，地方當局主要工作是撫救流亡·安定地方和修築道路。縣長胡日永，本來是靑年軍的指導員，爲人忠誠可親，憑他不息的工作，縣政已逐漸走上正軌了。</p>
<p>五日午，我們從磐石取道烟筒山返永吉，沿途所經站卡，龍將軍都受到民衆的熱烈歡迎與誠摯的致敬；尤其在烟筒山，一個小的鄕鎭，民衆熱情的奔騰，眞够動人。長長的歡迎行列中，還有獨豎一幟的韓僑學校員生。穿着白中帶點黄色的校服，搖旗呼喊。這里的韓僑民會會長，會說一口流利的華語，謁見龍將軍時懇談了二十分鐘。他說烟簡山的幾百韓僑中，有二百餘人參加八路去。留下來的也都生活困難，希望於短期內返到朝鮮去。龍將軍答應給他們轉達，惟未返國前，希望他們加強組織，不要擾及地方治安。要是安份守已，我們軍民也必然以友善的態度相遇的。</p>

<p>我國目前種種問題之病根，可以歸結於生產停滯。如再捨本逐末，但求治標，則必有病入膏盲的一天！治本之法，端在增加生產，尤以工業爲重。惟於此有一大前提－即政局之治平，因爲戰事是最使生產陷於停滯的。所以吾人要求立刻阻止戰亂，各黨派須確認世界經濟路向，在國父民生主義之原則下，實行民主化的農工政策。</p>
<p>（一）基礎　國父所昭示之「節制資本，平均地權」，及其實業計劃，與最近六全大會的工業建設綱領，農業土地政策，都是指示建設的計劃與方案的。我們所需要的資本，應該是民族產業資本，現在的各種畸形資本均將被逐出資本市塲。我們的工業化，應該建築在農業的基礎上的。我們應該保持我國固有的一份遺產－農業；工業化所得成果，亦惟有現在一批廣大的農民才配享受，因爲他們是市塲購買力的源頭。但要提高購買力，必須解決土地問題，這無論在治標治本二方面看，都是急不待緩的。</p>
<p>（二）生產成本原料的匱乏，也可說是原料的未能儘量開發，乃一大問題，此與技術人才有關。他如水火動力設備及供應之充沛，機器，工具設備等生產手段之改進，勞動力之培養及支配之合理，工資工潮之整飭，務使勞資協調，至於開支問題則有待於物價問題之解決。生產成本與生產技術，生產手段，有絕大關係，祗須看西歐工業革命前後生產情形之逈異，即可知道·現在適當原子能之發現，工業上或會發生一劃時代之變革。</p>
<p>（三）人才與管理　政府應培養人才，擢用眞才；如再繼續過去因人設事方式，則爲工業化前途一大障礙。如最近留法工程師郝某之死，即爲一例。同時不必諱疾忌醫，如一部出口貨因不合標準而遭退回，即爲技術落後所致。所以應一方培養本國人才，一方不得不利用外國技術人才，如長江三峽區水電大工程，只要權操在我，縱使的定辦法亦無妨大局。以苦幹精神有計劃的用科學管理方法，作正常人力資源之調遺支配，務使人盡其才，按勞取酬。</p>
<p>（四）外滙　滙率之高低，關係本國工商業者至鉅。中國向爲入超國家，故應運用關稅政策，對外滙加以嚴格管理與統制，並限制一部份非必需品之進口。庶幾進口貨不致傾銷，而影饗本國萌芽期民族工業之發展。至於出口事業，則可由國家用種種方法補助扶披之，俾使民族工業之投資與伸展可無顧忌。國際貿易應先求自足後，再圖國外市場之推展。如果一方輸出綿織品，一方又輸入次等綿織物，實爲不等價之交換，是乃畸形化的國際貿易。</p>
<p>（五）交通運輸及稅捐　一國交通網有如人身之血管，其重要可知。欲工業發達，必使交能運輸盡量發展，使產銷運輸靈活。但今日中國交通運輸機構阻梗不便，如上海鬧棉荒，而陝甘產區則有貨棄於地之現象。至於稅捐則宜多用直接徵收法，切忌轉嫁，尤應力求公平保育。對外貨之課稅，不宜過份優待。</p>
<p>上述數端，不過犖犖大者，他如與金融之聯繫，幣値之必須穩定，高利貸之必須廢除，生產手段之合理分配，合作社經營方式之推行等，亦均重要。蓋挽救工業之危機，決非僅在工業本身一端，其有關各部門均須同時注意。故中國工業化之前途是光明的，其關鍵全在計劃與實施者之能切實施行，俾使中國脆弱工業之嫩苗，能得迅速發榮滋長。（嚴成熙）</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>勝利後復員聲中，許多官員們都毫無困難的東下了。其次，稍有一點辦法的，也都設法領到了公家的費用，早已回到離開了八年的家國。祗有我們這一羣，數目在二十萬人以上的下江難民，（其實也是義民）仍舊在吃盡當光的生活下流浪在貴州以及西南！原因是：我們自己根本無法籌措一筆可觀的復員費，同時我們畢竟是難民，怎好意思責備公家把我們忘記了呢？</p>
<p>前些時，善救總署和公路局曾舉辦過遣送難民還鄉，辦法是普通難民的費用由署局津貼一半，赤貧的費用則運伙食費也統由署局負擔。但是曾幾何時，這種辦法，就在五月下旬宣吿停止了。這無異給予我們以死亡的打擊，因爲我們要期待遣送，所以把身邊所有的東西都典賣完了，現在我們簡直陷入了悲哀的絕境！</p>
<p>據說停止遣送的原因，是由於善救總署對於應付的補貼費未能如數撥足，公路局自然無力繼續墊付，這樣就虎頭蛇尾的把這件工作擱起來了。但是我們生計維艱，皇皇終日，政府和社會眞的就置之不問了麼？貴陽蘇籍難民張朝貴（泥水匠）劉克昌（理髮匠）時九如（小販）王發瑤（印刷工人）潘世昌（報販）</p>

<h3 id="c129">巢縣在荊棘中生長 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 十四日巢縣通訊　賣白萍</p>
<p>提起巢縣，讀者們也許對它不太陌生，它是馮玉祥張治中兩將軍的故鄕，瀕巢湖東岸，是皖中一個不算太小的縣份。從二十七年五月起，便在日本鬼子的魔爪下度過了七年又三個月苦難的歲月，去年八月十七日才重回到祖國的懷抱，七年多的折磨，數不盡災苦與辛酸，而今，雖是經過十一個月的經營和復興，但當極端破壞毀滅之後，依然碎瓦頹垣，荆棘　地，如果你是流浪歸來的本縣人，剛路進縣城，就會有披　「蕪城賦」之感。</p>
<p>敵偽造孽如今也鬧屋荒</p>
<p>今天的巢縣，不論城內或鄕下，也發生房荒問題，不過不像京滬那樣嚴重吧了。房荒的原因，不是「封條」也不是「刧收」，凡是鬼子到過的鄕鎭或村落，較好的房子要燒的就被燒掉，可折的就被折去了，城內更不用說，現在，逃亡的相繼歸來了，人口一天天在增加，淪陷期中原有的人住屋已感侷促，而又是只有破壤沒有建設，如今，每個人都在物價高壓下掙扎着，生活的鞭子已抽得人透不過氣來，更那裏談到建築房屋，如此，便形成了屋荒問題。</p>
<p>都市建設是比較容易恢復的，這裏就困難了，私人獨資建設固屬談不到，就以公共事業吧，譬如縣立中學原有校址被鬼子燒光了，勝利後地方人士就組織「巢縣中學校舍建築委員會」，動員了全縣人士募捐，挪用了地方不少公款，而現在部因沒有錢以致中途停工了，縣政府以及所屬機關，迄今還是租用民房，由此可見是公私兩困了！</p>
<p>滿肩担負　苦了善良百姓</p>
<p>房荒給予人民的痛苦倒不算尖刻，刧後災黎，好像遍身瘡毒，大瘡痛得太緊，也就忘記小瘡的痛處了。七年多來，老百姓在敵偽匪的三面搜刮下，早已皮破血流肉盡，而今只　下幾把枯骨了，需要豐富的營養，充足的生息，才有恢復原來健康的希望，但是事實呢，枯骨裏的髓液還在向外壓榨，壓榨得僅有低微的呻吟了！</p>
<p>巢縣的地方財政，記者還不淸楚，現在只就人民的負擔來說。去年中央豁免收復區田賦一年，這是國家的恩典，巢縣確也受惠，然而變象的捐稅却比田賦重多了，巢縣攤繳的七萬石軍糧，早已如數繳淸了，可是官定的糧價，已遠低於市價，就是這點賤價糧款，老百姓並沒有照官價如數到手，錢從那裏打了折扣呢？只有老百姓的心裏是雪亮的。雖然去年田賦免征，有個名目叫「縣級公糧」，每甲攤派三五十石不等，這只是一次，老百姓倒還忍受得下，而月月要米要草要錢的，則因本縣共有二十八鄕，每鄕有一鄉公所，一中心小學，每保有一保公所，一保國民小學，這些機關和學校，員丁及敎師的待遇，一切辦公費用，都由地方老百姓直接負擔，另外還有鄉保甲長臨時費用，也得起捐補償，而這還不算了事，縣保警隊士兵每月待遇是三市斗三市升糙米和三千元，這是包括伙食及薪餉在內的，因此，保警隊駐在某鄕，總得在地方上額外要點東西補塡伙食，這不是保警隊軍風紀問題，菲薄的待遇逼得他們不得不如此。還有，鄉公所的鄕丁每人每月所得的是五市斗米和五千元，在物價不斷高漲的今天，自給猶嫌不足，更何論仰事俯蓄？</p>
<p>到今天這個縣城和鄉下，米價也和京滬各市一樣上漲，原因是老百姓沒有米了，十家有九家已經沒有口糧，稻子還像靑草在田野中，它並不因主人的股望而一朝畏成，老百姓每天徘徊阡陌間，撫縻着唯一的生命綫，然而，兩個月後才有收獲，這兩個月中，依然要出米出草，還要出錢！</p>
<p>風調雨順　何時國泰民安</p>
<p>老百姓在愁苦的險影下，指望的是今年的年成了，借的錢，借的米，添加農具乃至嫁女娶媳，都準備在秋收後去償還，購買，自然婚嫁費用也出之在此。天有好生之德，今年莊稼誠然很好，自插秧到現在，眞是風調雨順，無憂水早，而且都說今年秧稻比去年好，自然收成比去年多，這在老百姓的心頭是一件天大的喜事。</p>
<p>現在老百姓雖然担負重重，但是秋收有望，他們已忘却自身的痛苦，而注目於國事了，兩個月來，本縣北鄕變成了共軍盤據地，他們神出鬼沒，聚散無常，一會化整爲零，一會化零爲整，因此他們究竟有多少人，還是一個啞謎。據說這是「人民的軍隊」，而他們是直接向老百姓要米要錢的，北鄉比較有點衣食的人家，已被弄得盡空，有時還要殺人擺擺威風，地方武力低弱，只能駐防堵塞，却不能進而追擊，弄得全縣老百姓遑遑不安。</p>
<p>國家經過九年的苦難，老百姓對於國事不再淡漠了，今天，他們希望的是和平，安定，國家統一，他們不担負重，自己苦，只要能過得太平日子，就心滿意足了。他們從前在敵偽魔爪下生活，雖是年年花開花謝，可是每年遇着平素最重視的舊曆年，却也讓它悄悄逝去，連春聯也不貼一張，直到去年勝利，才隆重地過了一次舊歷新年，正是「家家爆竹。戶戶桃符」未料國家「　」而不「利」，打倒了暴敵又發生「內戰」，一位老頭向筆者指着他的門上「風調雨順，國泰民安」的春聯說：「今年原是風調雨順，只是國泰民安究竟要到幾時才實現呢？</p>
<h3 id="c130">教育文化　在苦幹中邁進 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>老百姓仍然生活在暴風雨中，一切也就難能進步了，農村凋敝，城市的畸形繁榮又何能支持　國重任，而今天的每個城巿也呈現外強中乾的現象，隨著所有事業都是困難重重，筆者在此和教育文化兩界比較接近，現在就以這兩項說吧。</p>
<p>巢縣現有縣立中學一所，示範小學一所，張治中創辦的黄麓師範一所，各鄕保有中心小學和保小，每級學校同樣的病症是窮，尤其各中心小學和保小，因為米和錢直接向保甲徵收，而老百姓本身正嗷嗷待哺，自然不能按月拿出米和錢，老百姓拿不出米和錢，敎師們也只有挨餓了！中心和保小的敎師們無米爲炊是常事，如此而要辦好國家基本敎育，貴非兒戲！至於中心小學的敎師待遇每月是六巿斗米和一萬元，按月發給猶難免寅支卯糧，何况還要拖欠？記者在此虔誠向政府呼籲，請快些救救敎師們吧。</p>
<p>提到文化，可憐得很，全城找不出一個像樣的書店，報紙有兩家，一是黨政合辦的巢縣日報，一是靑年團組織的巢聲報，都是四開石印，只印一面，分爲兩版，第一版刋載國內外新聞，剪自京滬報紙，總得隔兩三天，第二版三分之二是地方新聞，三分之一是副刋，各版偶而有點廣吿，這兩家同樣在困苦中維持出版，工作人員苦幹的精神是値得佩服的。聽說省參議員童春暄先生縣中校長高啓沃先生以及地方熱心文化事業的人士，預備秋季籌辦印刷所，改石印爲鉛印，祝福他們順利成功，這對文化的促進上是必需的。</p>
<p>一般說來，今天的巢縣，老百姓在苦痛中，各界主持人在苦幹中，一切事業在復興中，記者顧有機會對這裏情形作第二次報道時，這枝禿筆能寫下令人喜悅的通訊。</p>

<h3 id="c131">西子湖濱之夏 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 本報七月二日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>「若把西湖比西子，濃裝淡抹兩相宜」滬是吟詠西子湖美麗的詞句，我們住在杭州的人，閒來無事。總愛向湖濱散步，的確，日光，月光，星光，把西湖襯托反映着各種不同的美。春天過了，西子湖已換上了夏季的裝束，堤邊岸畔，嫩綠的枝條已塗上一層較深的顏色，裏湖的荷葉繁茂，荷花含苞欲放，當划子經過的時候，船身擦過荷技，「剎剎」作響，好像它有很多話向要你傾訴。一陣陣荷香，使遊子感着輕鬆愉快。入夜，在沒有月亮的時候，很多人駕着小舟，帶着管弦，伴着女郎，在湖中歌唱，所以你在湖濱閒散，有很多划子曾以「聽小曲子去」作號召來逗引你乘他的舟子。</p>
<p>西湖百玩不厭</p>
<p>西湖是够美麗的了，有許多杭州人對我講：「我們生長在杭州三四十年，但對玩西湖還是不厭膩的。」杭州市因爲有西湖，所以每年都有一大筆收入，我聽有些人講，「因爲西湖之能供養杭州巿，所以巿政府以全力來整理西湖」。這句話在表面聽來似乎很好，但底下一想，不免對市政當局有所非難。事實也難怪人家批評，一條最熱鬧馬路保佑坊一帶，兩旁却穢水四溢，商店儘量在裝扮粉飾，播送音樂，號召主顧，但看看躺在他們面前的臭水，實在是一幅有力的諷刺畫。其他各條馬路如淸泰路等，也不能例外，我們更耽心這些馬路上的柏油路面，不久就要敗壞。而小巷子及各條背街，「具」是應該的，黑夜裏要你摸索回家也是必然的事實。</p>
<p>近來像在疏濬巿內湖渠，「飲，洗，大小便」咸宜的浣紗溪，還是一樣的被「飲，洗，大小便」所忙碌着。因爲杭州巿內臭水到處流溢，所以蚊蠅特別多，這些蚊蠅胆量不小，你把扇子把牠驅開了，待你扇子不扇時，牠又來了，尤其蚊虫可起來特別深刻，呌你痛　難熬。</p>
<p>杭州市民嘉歡飲「天落水」，天落水者，則是在屋　裝置的洋鐵「格漏」漏下來的水。每逢下雨的天氣雨從瓦屋上流到「格漏」裏，再從「格漏」裏流到水缸裏，他們不問瓦屋上有沒有齷齪，有沒有猫尿島糞，都以飲「天落水」爲最上的飲料。</p>
<p>許多酒店吃食店，很少有把紗罩罩住燒熟的食品的，大多任憑灰塵蒼蠅的光顧。</p>
<p>赤膊工作</p>
<p>杭州市除了少數在西子湖濱華貴的建築要有抽水馬桶等衛生設備的，其餘一律都用「馬子」，倒馬子的人不一定像上海樣一大早就來。有的甚至接近午飯的時候來倒的，因此糞便與飯菜同時相晤。有的吃飯，便所，住處都在一起的人，更是不堪設想，但是也習慣了，習慣了也不以爲奇了。</p>
<p>杭州巿民也有很多是貧困的，他們還要尋求他們的工作，於是在一面工作一面揮汗的情景下，「赤膊」這一件事是極爲普通的，雖然在幾條堂皇的馬路上見不到，但在背街小巷，也是司空見慣了。</p>
<p>舞場取締以後</p>
<p>西子湖濱的舞場是已經取締了，代之而興的是女校書，還有女子歌唱，女子說書等，但總不及舞塲生意之盛。最近許多女校書也有陪客遊玩的，市政府雖然在校書塲貼着「不准陪坐」，可是在書塲以外總不能禁止的吧？而况在畫塲又誰能分別出這是校書，這不是校書來。中國酒家已在杭州最高的大樓「西華大樓」屋頂辦了一個屋頂花園，用蘆蓆蓋搭一些草棚子，用引誘人的字眼寫着「電梯上落」，事實上，杭州之有電梯還是第一次，但以「電梯上落」爲號召，這不免小看了杭州老鄕。</p>
<p>金國舞廳現在改了表演舞藝，西園改了說書，西湖改了歌唱。不知怎樣，上海一些低級趣味的丑角却在這裏大出風頭各家娛樂的塲所都以「禮聘滑稽大家×××」等顯著的標題來　取顧客。</p>
<p>迎紫路到湖濱</p>
<p>入晚，從迎紫路到湖濱，可以聽見到處是「叮叮搭」的聲音，這是一些賣冰水的人，他們擺一個個小攤子，用很多玻璃杯，杯裏盛着涼水，水裏放些紅與黃的顏色，再放一些糖，另外有一塊冰塊，用他們特製的　刨刨些下來，放在杯子的水裏，賣五十元一杯。這「叮叮搭」的聲音，就是　　搖動時的碰擊聲，這價廉的冷飲果然生意興隆。</p>
<p>夏天的杭州，大概不外以上所述，但一直到現在，沒有發現一個患霍亂的人。有人問：「這是什麽道理」？有人答：「這是佛國，菩薩有靈，所以不降災於抗州的老百姓啊」！</p>

<p>— 中原</p>
<p>在這個世界中，有許多頂頂可愛的紅，也有許多頂頂可怕的紅。可愛的紅像春天的薔薇玫瑰，詩人的紅葉紅豆。可怕的紅線戰塲上的血海血河，原子炸彈的烈燄大火，這是大家都知道的。但現在我要吿訴你一個紅的故事，全不是這些。請你靜靜地聽着吧。</p>
<p>是一個演劇的活潑的小女子，她說：「我太胖了！」</p>
<p>於是她儘量減少食物，只吃一點兒稀飯，一點兒水果，一點兒未加過糖的咖啡。</p>
<p>果然她滿意了，照照鏡子，細腰如柳，瘦腿如畫。可是她又發現了缺點，說道：「我的嗓子太啞！」</p>
<p>道似乎有些難了，可是請敎了別人，也不難，每天淸晨吃二隻生鷄蛋，每天對着大海喊幾聲。此外，那個指敎她的人凑在她耳邊悄悄的說：「只要Face出色，嗓子略爲差一點，不要緊！」</p>
<p>小女子會意地一笑，於是一切都準備好了。</p>
<p>第一夜布幕拉開來，台底下寂靜無聲。——小女子很着急，拚命飛着媚眼。</p>
<p>第二夜布幕拉開來，台底下有了一聲輕微的「好呵」。——小女子得到一絲兒安慰，再拚命飛着媚眼。</p>
<p>第三夜布幕拉開來，台底下一陣劈劈拍拍。——小女子微微地笑了，儘管拚命飛着媚眼。</p>
<p>終於有一夜，布幕拉開來，台底下轟然一聲！——小女子心花怒放，知道自己紅了！</p>
<p>紅了！一切都改變了！</p>
<p>小女子打一個噴嚏，小報上一首新詩。小女子晐一聲嗽，小報上一篇妙文。小女子流一滴眼淚，那是了不得，不得了！……</p>
<p>三點鐘張總經理的汽車停在門口；四點鐘李主任的電話來了；五點鐘大學生小王捧着鮮花出現在後門口，六點鐘新聞記者老陳在弄堂裏打口嘯。……</p>
<p>畫報上每期登載小女子的照片，小女子不得不埋頭研究，如何能使照片拍得「美目盼兮，巧笑倩兮」。……</p>
<p>大公司大旅館不時請小女子揭幕剪彩，小女子不得不日夜挖空心想設計新裝，如何能打扮得超羣出衆，美如天仙。……</p>
<p>太多了！太多了！總之，小女子紅了，可是，千百條視綫束縛了她的手脚，千百張嘴巴侍候着她的行動，千百隻耳朶管理着她的發音，千百件心事堆壓在她的心頭，她是再也得不到安眠和自由了！</p>
<p>故事已講完。你一定要說，還麽一個淺薄無意思的故事，有什麽說的。但世界上越是淺薄無意思的事，有時越是令人費解。譬如這個故事裏的小女子，你當然要笑她愚蠢自找煩惱。但是且慢！請你拿面鏡子照照自己看：咦！不是你也正在拚命的向人「飛媚眼」，拚命的想「紅」起來嗎？</p>

<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>這正是一個風雨飄搖的晚上，雨滴不斷地敲打在屋頂上，寒風嘶嘶地從窗隙中透了進來，給予了我一種陰森而恐怖的感覺。</p>
<p>在書桌上，閃盪着一盞黯淡的油燈，一條帶烟的熖尾，不斷地在寒風中搖晃。微弱的燈光，更把這間狹小的屋子裝飾得陰森而可怕的。當鼠子們沙沙地從我的脚下跑過時，我幾乎懷疑這巳經不是人世，似乎這狹小的屋子在暗暗的轉變，在晴暗的縮小，好像它將要和我一同埋葬在這風雨飄搖的世界裏。當我恐怖地拉開了門，一陣急狂的寒風，和帶着零散的雨絲撲落在我的臉上。在白天，那雄峙在江的對岸的山頭，那靑綠的樹木和臨江的屋宇，己隱沒在黑暗的氛圍裏，整個的世界都被然暗所吞蝕，河山和天空，融成了一片漆黑的顏色。</p>
<p>忽然從遙遠的江岸上，飄閃着一點明亮的燈光，像螢火般的在風雨中飄搖，飄過了江頭，飄過了山徑，而慢慢地消逝在黑暗的山影裏。我知道，那是黑夜旅人的路燈，在這凄風苦雨的黑夜裏，人世是多麼的冷酷，風和雨像無情的人生怒濤，不斷地向他猛襲着，而人世的道路又是那麽的不平，揉和着雨水的泥濘，在任何時候都可能使他滑跌，使他跌上了苦痛的傷痕。可是，這一點光明的路燈，像母親慈愛的心，做朋友溫暖的手，給予了他以無限的慰藉，給予他以無限的溫暖，使他能從這險惡的道路上，一步步的走向了那溫暖而光明的地方。</p>
<p>飄搖的燈光已經消逝了，世界又重歸黑階，不知道在道黑暗的世界裏，還有多少人在風風雨雨的道路上摸索呢！因爲他們都失掉了光明的路燈，在風雨飄搖的黑夜裏，他們得不到任何帮助，而只能讓這在暴的風雨把他們吞蝕。</p>
<p>黑暗似乎在膨賬着，風和雨變得更狂暴了，寒冷，陰森的氣息，不斷地在我的四週彌漫，似平我將被捲入這可怕的世界裏。</p>
<p>當我又恐怖地關上了門，重問到書桌的前面時，那一蓋昏暗的油燈，却變得可愛了，我剔掉些燈花，讓它發出了明亮的光。</p>
<p>在這黑暗的世界裏，只有它才會給我以光明和溫暖啊！</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>中國的命運，也像　華的命運一樣，在經過無數次的刧難以後，漸漸有一點新的展望了！當北洋軍閥的勢力，還繼續着塗炭人民的罪行的時候，革命軍人揭起了「打倒軍閥」的旗幟，開始了北伐的職爭！中國，在祈禱着一個新的理想之實現，麗華，也在祈禱着一個新的理想之實現！</p>
<p>麗華把劉子雲和董劭凌都尊若師長，但對董劭凌却隱隱還具有另一種無以名之的感情。這感情也許就是墨太太所引爲憂懼的感情。但麗華是不自知的。她只覺得董劭凌有一種能够牽制她的力量，響譽：　華若有三天以上不去看他，就感到像有多重的負担在壓着她！又響譽：若是董劭凌有三天以上不去聽麗華的戲，麗華從台上　不見那永遠坐在台下右邊廂的董劭凌，她便會立刻茫然地惶惑起來！她自己也很奇怪，她從來沒有過這種經騐。而她和董劭凌在一起的時候，她又仍舊是沉默寡言。不過她總是微笑的，她的微笑好像就是絮語；就是說不淸的無限情緒！</p>
<p>董劭凌，一個富於感情的神經質文人。但他的感情是發揮在多方面，換言之，他的愛憎是多方面的，正如他的天才是多方面的一樣。響譽：他愛山，也愛水；愛花，也愛草；愛繪畫，也愛音樂；愛新文學，也愛舊詩詞；愛貓狗，也愛雀烏；愛女人，也愛男人。他憎盜賊，也憎宦官；憎娼妓，也憎嫖客；憎貧窮，也憎富貴，憎愚蠢，也憎狡詐。爲了這原故，他的感情便不能集中在一個「愛」，或「憎」的焦點上！他可以爲你死，也可以為他死；但這是不可能的，因此他常常爲感情不够分配而苦惱！而不滿足！他從來沒有站在自我的立塲上爲自己想過一件事，作過一件事，所以，他又可謂之爲：無我主義的浪漫派文人·他對於豐華很愛護，也可以說是很喜歡她；很同情她，很願幫助她。但他的「愛護」像愛護一個孩子；一個晚輩；他的「喜歡」，像喜歡一朶花；一齣戲劇；他的「向情」，像同情一雙無辜被獵射的雁雀；像同情一般被虐待，被傷害的人；他的願「幫助」，像願幫助所有壓迫下的弱者。因此他所給予麗華的感情，並沒有什麼特殊，像給予一切人的感情一樣。</p>

<p>— 謝北城</p>
<p>有一個時期，曾經住在天津，第一次嘗到洪水爲災的滋味。記得那時候，距離「七七」不久，但天津却已經淪陷了，大家的心中裹着一重煩鬱，天天等待着由門縫中投送進來的油印報紙，（我們經歷過淪陷區生活的人自然明白，我們被迫着做啞吧，也被迫着做聾子，）那些地下工作者的熱情是値得感謝的。漸漸我認識了他們，這也是很短暫的事，終於我聽見說他們那可憐的汕印報館「破獲」了，全部工作人都被逮去，有的就這樣失蹤了，有的許多日子之後，蓬頭垢面的來和我握手辭行，我的心情是比別人更多一重煩鬱的。</p>
<p>在一個傍晚，坐在「膠皮」上，我把這幾位「新聞工作人員」送到紫竹林碼頭，聽見在租界的一家廣院裏，有孩子們高聲的唱：</p>
<p>「起來，不願做奴隷的人們！</p>
<p>把我們的血肉築成我們新的長城……。」</p>
<p>許久許久沒有聽見這親切的歌聲了，眼睛中含着激動的淚，我握住朋友們的手：</p>
<p>「祝福你們……！」</p>
<p>朋友們低聲的回報我：</p>
<p>「大家走着自己該走的路，而祇有孩子是該祝福的！」</p>
<p>我記住他們的話，默默的走向歸途，暮色中，還聽見孩子們的歌聲：「要收復失地，打倒日本帝國主義，把舊世界的强盜殺光！」</p>
<p>就在這種的煩鬱中，我們每天聽到另外的一些消息：「牆子河漲水了。」接着是天天落雨，牆子的水一天比一天高，洪水就要來了，自家的性命要緊，失了祖國的煩鬱慚漸淡漠了，代之而興的是家家砌圍牆，堵門口，築堤壩，而終於一天晚上，天上來了大雷雨，夜裏水淹了天津。</p>
<p>我住的地方不太高，也不太矮，水祗浸了一層樓，暫時我把浴缸拆下來，由窗口送出去，權爲代步，這種生活自然也太無聊，但確也淸靜了不少，狗腿子們已經無從施展他們刺探的技倆了。每天我想法子爲我的那些遠去的朋友們做一點事，但是我有什麽好做呢？</p>
<p>別人却已經先我而行了：</p>
<p>那是洪水後一個細濛濛的雨天，窗外孩子們用竹竿打着水，喊着：</p>
<p>「又是一張，又是一張…」</p>
<p>「呯」竹竿打在水上。由窗口探顯出去看，上游上有無數紙摺的小船盪下來，都被孩子們截去了。</p>
<p>以後我每次駕着我那浴缸出去的時候，必有孩子們偷偷的遞給我一張小紙，上面寫着祖國活耀的消息，一切都是値得憧憬的呵！我記起了朋友的話，每逢運綿的陰雨天，我總在想：</p>
<p>「爲孩子們祝福吧！」</p>

<p>又是蟬聲聒耳的長夏季節了，我們一別竟已九年，這九年，是多麼漫長的夢境啊！</p>
<p>我愛你，同時我也恨你；我想念你，但我同時在打算永遠不要再看見你。這九年中你一直把我放在一個甜密而迷惘的夢裏，我已經把靑春全部獻出在那裏待你歸來的歲月上而；現在我離開了夢的邊緣孤獨的踽踽歸來了，歡樂與哀愁對我都將淡却，我祇有一絲矛盾而帶着辛酸的心情，和那殘酷的深植在我記憶裏往事與夢痕。</p>
<p>你總該不會忘記這惱人而又可愛的雨季吧！九年前我們在烽烟中握別的時候，那凄其的雨霧正　蝕着我們那懷着淡淡的憂鬱的心，我和你默默的並肩走向畢　路，我失神的注視着道傍桐葉尖上一粒飄搖欲隊的水珠，我低低的吿訴了你，這恐怕就是我未來的命運象徵底　言，你當時竟沒有如我私裏祈求着的豪邁的搖一下頭，你的沉默使我有彷彿已經踏入了一個惡魔的感覺；我無聊地用那冷得發顫的手去替你抹掉衣角上泥濘，你忽然憎恨的說：</p>
<p>「上海的雨季委實太討厭了！」</p>
<p>你不是就要離開它的嗎？……內地也許是要比較値得留戀的。」</p>
<p>我這句話正觸着了你那想像中的光明的遠景，常你用溫馨而沉毅的唇底欣快地吮了我那靨邊的時候，熱情的奔騰使我在那一個有濃重夜霧的杳分毫不後悔地對你獻出了我的生命和血流。</p>
<p>我從不吝嗇像你那樣把熱血灑向祖國天空的一個騎士型的英離曾經佔有過我，我也從不後悔像你那樣一個勇敢而眞誠的朋友竟眞的遺棄了我；因爲我知道你已經用了對愛情一樣的勇敢對付了你的敵人，你也用了對情人一樣的眞誠效忠了我們的國家。我現在所能够撫偎着的是你最後從衡陽發出的一封信，這封信我將留作我殉葬的珍禮，留着等待我生命的終了。</p>
<p>我現在特別喜歡仰看那多雲的雨季的天空，我彷彿期待着會瞥見我所熟悉的那九年前溫情的投影；我現在也特別喜愛到外灘去俯瞰那滔滔東去的江流，我似乎意識到那纔是我心頭上流出去的聖潔而純擊的無價的祭品；我現在預備以迢　的憶念來遣送我這僅餘的靑春，因爲這青春原是屬於你所有的啊！</p>
<p>上海今年的雨季特別長，膩潤的雨絲總是那麼輕柔地溫慰着我這枯寂已久的心；好幾次我踄越過大水到畢勛路去重履那曾作過我們輓歌的纏綿的泥濘，藍色的小夜曲穿過黄昏中幽靜深沉的街道樹，夜霧依然那麽濃重，這九年來從未變易過的沉鬱的風情啊！你可知道我已渡越了一個漫長而惶惑的夢境？我唇邊還留着哀怨的吻痕，我體內還流着高貴而莊嚴的熱情，但是，我靈的池沼裏已經凝固成像梵蒂岡中修女們一樣的絕壑和深愁！</p>
<p>我恨你!你爲什麽不在魂夢裏予我以持續的佔有？讓我重溫一下九年前的往昔底燦爛與豪華；但是我同時在打算永遠不要再看見你!因爲我鄙夷你這樣一具勇敢而奔放的靈魂竟隨着片片春花無聲息地委入泥土；忘懷了去慰藉一個孤寂的被你摯愛過的　人！</p>
<p>蟬聽聒耳的長夏季節就要逝去，雨季也快要離開身週了；這殘酷的時間於我已無所依戀，我靜靜地默誦着你的信，我將永恒地祈禱你有一個不朽的永不乾　的安眠！</p>

<p>— 黎譯</p>
<p>每星期二出版</p>
<p>本文係耶魯大學見童敎育院理事安諾德該速爾博士近作，刋載於五月二十六號的紐約時報週刋上，特爲摘譯介紹於賢明的父母與敎師們。</p>
<p>正在生長中的兒童實在是最複雜的生機，他一定要慢慢地生長，而且必須自己生長，我們固然可以予他以合宜的環境，但是我們不能分祖他生長的工作·</p>
<p>這種生長的過程最淸楚地表現在他運動能力的發展中，一個孩子從伸直他的身子到學會走路，總要經過二十幾個階段，開頭他不過能够伏着抬起頭來，然後他可以用他的肚子爬動，慢慢的他會用手和脚前前後後的爬，最後他會站起來走路了。</p>
<p>同樣的，孩子們要一步步地學習眼睛，雙手，以及手指的運用。十六星期時他只能用跟睛釘住那十方木塊，而不能用手去拿；到二十八星期他可以硬生生地象猫爪子似的把它拑起來；而到四十星期就可以拿得滿有把握了</p>
<p>這種逐步發展的過程也同樣控制着兒童在不同年齡中的行爲與態度。譬如拍擊先於推移，用粉筆畫直綫比畫曲綫或者斜綫來得早，搭積木一定先會搭高塔，然後會造橋，沒有文法的短句先於完全的句子，單獨的玩要早於合羣的遊戲，形象的認識早於抽象的觀念等等。</p>
<p>一般的錯誤</p>
<p>敎師與父母們雖也常常利用這種自然發展的過程去敎育與訓練兒童，然而他們不够認識兒童的成熟程度，與成熟的過程。往往孩子受到嚴重的責罰，僅僅是爲了她的不够成熟，做不像樣·父母（或者是祖父母）尤其常常爲了孩子吃飯不象樣而發怒，其實吃飯以至其他日常生活習慣的養成，完全要靠畏期的家庭環境的濡染，與他自己能力的逐漸成熟。</p>
<p>我們在敎育上所犯的主要錯誤就在我們過份重視孩子們「應該」怎樣，因而多少忽視了孩子們「在」怎樣，與實在「是」怎樣的問題，這樣就很自然地造成我們對孩子武斷的要求與專橫的敎育方法。</p>
<p>當然，並不是說我們就該獎勵孩子的壞行爲與驕縱，一味的放任，那就根本失去了敎育的眞義。不過深入的探究錯誤行爲的發生規律，可以帮助我們來施行更開明的管敎。在一切的訓練中，我們必須能够看到自己，也看到孩子，不使我們的要求超過孩子的成熟程度。</p>
<p>二歲至十歲</p>
<p>下面就的略地談談從二歲到十歲的兒童，心理發育的一般狀態：</p>
<p>據嬰兒院父母們的苦訴，兩歲半是一個最叫人迷惑，也最叫人生氣的時期，兩歲半的兒童是最矛盾而且沒有理智的，他往往同時作二個相反的要求，要，又不要；去，又不去；是，又不是，他自己弄不清楚他要怎樣，因而也常常容易發脾氣，在一個時間他接受了你的意思，可是馬上，毫無理由的他又拒絕了，這原因就如同他剛剛學爬行，而還不能爬動的時候，只會兩面搖擺，兩歲半的兒童心理是正在達到平衡的搖動過程，所以用不到着急，到三歲時他就要成為最可愛最聽話的孩子，他慢慢地學會了抉擇。</p>
<p>三歲實在是一個最快活的時期，雖然這麽小，但是他已經能够掌握住自己了。不僅如此，他而且漸慚會討人喜歡，遵照別人的指示，他會問：「是這樣做嗎？」這表示他已經開始自覺的要求敎育。</p>
<p>新的發展</p>
<p>但是他的心理還在綱縱發展，他不會長期停留在這個相對的平衡狀態，到四歲他又要向新的方面發展，他　然不像以前那樣在乎別人的稱讚或是責備，要他順從，他會倔强地問你「爲什麽」？他總是企圖脫離羈範，他被認爲愛說謊，會拿別人的東西，因爲他實在還不大能够區分事實與幻想。</p>
<p>假如管理得好，那麽這個向外擴展的四歲又慢慢來到建設的五歲，他接受而且要求別人的指導，非常地順從，所以就發展的進程說，這是又一個相對的平衡的階段。</p>
<p>然而發展的進程馬上又將帶他到一個更煩惱的時期，到六歲他又會失去那種可愛的脾氣，他變得很暴躁，喜歡爭論，就好像他成天都在和自己，和環境作戰似的，有時候他很多疑，猶豫，暴烈的發脾氣，有時候又很和順，很可親近。</p>
<p>不過這裏應該指明的是兒童在這一年齡，正好開始他的學校生活，而學校裏的敎師不能够懂得兒童心理發展的這一重要階段，違反心理衛生的敎育也就更使孩子變得急燥，難馴。</p>
<p>新的平衡</p>
<p>正常的發展，那麼到七歲時，又將達到一個新的平衡，他比從前更能把握自己，不像先前那麼衝動，比較沉靜，對師長同學漸漸確立了感情，他進入到一種吸收消化的狀態，一天有一天的進步。</p>
<p>到八歲左右，他又重新進入一個向外擴張的時期，他自動地去接觸環境，友愛地結交同學。</p>
<p>這樣到十歲，他更能够切當地適應環境，他很謹愼而同時也很警覺。對什麼都無所畏懼，做什麼都很快，他也很喜歡在功課上和別人競爭，而他更特別容易接受關於社會各方面的知識，感受是非好壞的偏見，他已經能够參加主要的社會問題的討論，譬如犯罪，勞工管理，黑市等等問題，所以這實在是實施思想敎育的黄金時期。</p>

<p>— 清音</p>
<p>前期慕燕君的「番茄」一文中，不贊成番茄之被人稱作番茄，因爲它無論在形態，內容與色澤上都類柿而不類茄，不如稱之爲西紅杮來得恰當，而且說番茄一詞是沿用已慣的俗稱。</p>
<p>按食用番茄之傳入中國，是近幾十年的事，取名番茄在今日因爲叫慣了覺得不新鮮，這僩番字尤其「那個」，但是在當時給他中國名字的時候，番字適用於冠於一切洋玩意兒上，這個茄字也安得再合適沒有了。番茄在植物分類上屬於茄科，在四川番茄被稱爲洋海椒，海椒也屬於茄科，當時命名的人不見得就知道這些，可是他的觀察却準確可喜。我們在巿面買得到的番茄是最普遍的品類，其他品種顏色形狀變化很多，有金黄色的，有黄綠色的，有玫瑰紅的，有紫紅的，……有的像蘋菓，有的像櫻桃，有的像馬奶，也有眞像茄子的，……花果的構造生長特性，用途等等與柿子都無法比擬，所以我以爲番茄這個俗稱還値得繼續使用，一直等到有更好的名字發現。（却酬）</p>

<p>哈尼先生：</p>
<p>我是個在充滿着鳥烟　氣的環境裏長成的女孩子，不知道什麼是光明？什麼是自由？心裏有苦，沒地方申訴，碰到難以解決的問題，旣無人磋商，更無人指導。今天不揣冒昧地寫這封信給您，請您不要使我失望，指示我一條途徑。</p>
<p>我今年十七歲，曾經在義務夜校裏讀過幾年書，識得一些字，因此，我的一對把女兒看作搖錢樹的父母，總是從識得幾個字的上面轉我的念頭。先是要我做妓女，說是「長三」裏的倌人，賣嘴不賣身的，這算不來下流。後來經過我拚死命的反對，他們改變主意要我去做舞女，我又死不答應，於是他們又出了一個好主意，要我去學唱戲。我家對門住着一個唱越劇的女伶，我的母親就托她介紹我去學越劇，現在事情是成功了，我不知道應該答應呢？還是反抗。我常常聽先生說：一個女子經濟要獨立，但不可做人家的玩物，我不知道做女戲子是不是算作玩物，請你給我一個指示。敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　倪彩菊敬上</p>
<p>彩菊女士：</p>
<p>從你娟秀的字跡和通順的文句，我知道你是個很有希望的女性。祇愛金錢而抹殺一切的人，在上海這個人肉市塲裏，不僅僅祇有你的父母如此。你能够救拔自己而不肯由你父母支配一切，這是你强過別人的地方。根據這一點看來，我想你如一時找不到別的滿足你父母的職業的時候，學唱越劇，也沒有什麼不可以。你要知道戲劇原是一種現身說法的敎育工具，祇要你立志做個爲敎育大衆而努力的「女藝人」，而不做隨波遂流，甚而出賣色相的「女戲子」，這樣學唱戲也是一種正當的職業。不過在目前病態的社會裏，你投身戲劇界之後，免不了有許多阻力逼着你不能順利的前進，到了那樣的時候，你必須要拿出你現在反抗你父母那種毅力去粉碎你的障礙。我的答覆如此，不知你以爲滿意嗎？祝</p>
<p>你奮鬥成功！　哈尼</p>

<p>本報同人昨天假金神父路靑年團上海支團部舉行第二次聯歡園遊會，支團部的地方很大，花園裏的佈置非常整潔雅緻，以前曾聽人說過地方不錯，而且臨時參議會也在那里賞過櫻花，昨天我是第一次去，的確不錯。據說原來是三井洋行經理的花園。我曾到過善鐘路三菱洋行經理的住宅，規模亦堪與此相伯仲。三井三菱都是日本最大的財閥，其財富力量不僅可以左右日本政治，連日本皇室也得退讓三分。現在，在麥克阿瑟管制之下，已解散了這種剝削日本人民的財閥體系了。</p>
<p>我瀏覽了這座花園式的巨第，小橋，荷池，茅亭，踱着步子，說不出心頭的一種激盪，這個世界爲什麽有無數人無立錐之地，有少數人宅第連雲？這個大的懸殊不僅不合理，而且也不是人類的幸福，因爲它將引起反抗來的。以目前上海爲例，房荒似乎很嚴重，但據我所知，並不是每問屋子都住有人。有許多房子硬是空在那里，房主連金條都不屑一顧，有許多人一個人住十幾間房子，這種現象眞令人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>支團部的這座花園，環境够優美的，我覺得如果像現在這樣偶然機會使用一次，或者很少數的人遊覽，我建議靑年團當局將它公開，不如將它改爲兒童文化公園。我這個建議有如下的幾種理由的：</p>
<p>一，使兒童們常常接近靑年團，對靑年團有印象，將來長成時可以逐漸成爲靑年團的忠實團員；</p>
<p>二，靑年團本身，對兒童福利的工作也應該做，現在利用這旣有的地方，無需花錢，可謂惠而不廢</p>
<p>三，可以酌量收最小數額的門票，作爲花園的整理費。</p>
<p>我這個建議，不知能蒙賢明的靑年團當局採納否？</p>

<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>不多幾天的晚上，我們二房東姚太太走親家回來，途經西藏路皇后大戲院附近，只見一輛吉普車橫衝直撞，不按規例駕駛，竟靠左而行，由去的路上來，雪亮的燈光，如猛虎的兩只巨眼，人見了也害怕，來車躱避不及，擦着吉普車邊，翻了，連車帶人都翻了，車子拋入人行道旁，車夫倒在路上呻吟着，兩個乘客拋上人行道，還好，那車夫掙扎着起立，乘客面部出血，傷不甚重。路人和他說：「還不妨事，回去包索吧」！</p>
<p>不料說話未完，正面向前的一輪三輪車又給那吉普車撞個正中。車子翻身，乘客被車身輾過，血肉糢糊，躺在地上，見他不勝痛楚，還用手摩面，一會兒便死了。那人年約二十餘歲，穿畢挺香港衫，西裝褲，手錶金戒，衣袋揷派克金筆一支。終爲流血過多，不能挽救，傷哉！連尋車夫不見，原來是軋入車下，也死了！</p>
<p>當慘劇發生，已過午夜，一時觀衆雲集，包圍那車。警笛亂吹，警察趕來，駕車兩美兵，把車門嚴局，安閱地吸着烟。警察閒他開車如何這般狂駛，斥責他幾句，沒有下文。觀衆只是發怒地望着。姚太太也就回來了。</p>
<p>那撞死的小開，也許從舞塲回來，禍遭不測，樂極生悲。但常人遇着，也不能例外，交通之不安全，正成了上海居民的一個恐懼。但美兵並非有意傷人，定是酗酒無主，胡亂駕駛車輛，但其應負殺人之過失，無可異議！據說肇事禍士兵，由其軍官押解回國處刑；可是不想出一個懲前紫後的辦法，上海的交通實在是太危險了！</p>
<h3 id="c145">「面子」問題 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡</p>
<p>面子和交通，寫在一起，似乎有點不倫不類。其實說穿了也正是目前本市交通上的一種病態。我們要整飭本市的交通，自不應該忌疾諱醫。</p>
<p>或老要問，這種病態，是怎樣的情形？例如：「超速駕駛」，「並行搶先」，「闖紅燈」，在一般駕駛人認爲這樣是有「面子」的！自然，彼之所謂有「面子」，還是由於駕駛人是一個有「面子」的人物，或是他的車伕，戤了他的「面子」，也會不肯落人後，不願受規定速率，及紅燈的的束，而任所要爲的駕駛車輛！反正，違了章，肇了禍，有的是「面子」，便可大事化小，小事化無·因此，你也如此，我也這樣，縱有裊裊的交通管理規則，訂定了取締懲處的辦法，如果不被除「面子」，亦等於具文而已！</p>
<p>其實，這種不守規章，破壞善良秩序的人，最沒有「面子」，不但他個人沒有面子，而且造成了國家的沒有面子！</p>

<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>電車過站不停，也許還情有可願，因爲有些乘客太「只顧自己，不顧人家。」但是東頭的「終點標　」時常弄錯，明明開往外灘，仍然掛着「靜安寺」，這不能不說是：「拆爛汚」！</p>
<p>從前原有的好風氣，例如讓座，守秩序，而現在已經不復存在；取而代之者是有我無人，自私自利，上車下車槪由窗門爬進爬出，令人傷心！這行動多出於「强硬之流」；他們自以爲這是「英勇」，其實是「野餐」！</p>
<p>我們呼籲：爲了國家面子之完整，此風不可長！</p>
<p>車廂中人，暴躁成性，一言不合，便開口駡人，動手打人，一點不能同車共濟！在「文明」社會裏，此風不可長！</p>
<p>一張嘴巴兩張皮，翻來復去都是理。揩油在今日，說起來理由堂皇得很。最普遍的理由是：「反正揩外國人的油」！</p>
<p>這樣的心理，一言以蔽之：沒有出息！</p>
<p>此風不可長！</p>
<h3 id="c147">因噎廢食智者不為，一路電車不該減少。 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 顏子</p>
<p>十七日少夫君撰電車一文說：他的親戚，在南京路等一路電車，一次經五十分鐘，一次歷三十分鐘，都沒有等着，而感嘆時間枉費得可惜。</p>
<p>據說：一路電車的所以少，是英商電車公司爲了四川北路乘客的揩油風太甚，他們都是强硬之流，雖然當局在車中貼着皇皇佈吿，叫他們要和普通乘客同樣買票，可是依舊不理，視若無覩。電車公司在自己無辦法當局無力處置之下，就來了這麽一個消極對策，少派車輛，少受損失。他們最好是廢除一路車，現在的還有幾輛在敷衍，已是予由靜安寺和四川北路往來者以絕大恩惠了。</p>
<p>電車公司這辦法，爲他的權利打算，固是上策！可是他忘了他對社會的義務，在社會的立塲，英國人也會把公用事業完全放在個人主義的觀點上，實爲可怪！實爲可嘆！尤爲可怪可嘆的是：上海公用事業的主管者，也視若無覩，悶聲不響，忘了自己管的是什麼事。今日的四川北路，牠的繁榮情形，已和去秋去冬大不同了。在勝利初來之後，這裏的敵國僑民，無論商店居戶，都紛紛集中起來，沿街舖屋，關閉甚多，一時殊感　條，少開幾輛電車，似乎沒有多大關係。現在國人紛紛遷來，所以四川北路已恢復了昔日的繁榮，熙來攘往，熱鬧異常。况且中正公園又在四川北路之底，而那裏的游泳池最近又已開放，這四川北路電車交通的改善益感迫切，不知英商電車公司知道這情形沒有？公用當局又知道這情形沒有？</p>
<p>如果有人問，要改善到怎麽樣，你們才滿意呢？則我來舊事重提一下：戰前我有一年餘居於靜安寺，而辦事處則在四川北路底，每天朝出晚歸，以一路電車代步，全程車資是十八枚銅圓，時間是四十五分鐘，而隨時有車可乘，即使有時要等一等，也至多不會超過十分鐘·今日的要求，除車資外，其餘兩點，是可作當局參攷的。你說這是奢環嗎？</p>

<p>— 胡德齡</p>
<p>現在乘電車，在乘客的立塲上講，簡直是受罪：車輛少，乘客多顯見得擁擠，往往候了二三十分鐘，還未上車，主是司空見慣，不足爲怪，假使來了一輛電車，都是爭先恐後的要先軋上去，搶座位，秩序混亂不堪，不是脚被踏痛，衣裳踐破，定是口袋金錢不翼而飛。天氣炎熱，許多人擠在一起，不識相的，還要吸香烟，烟味，臭汗格外感到悶熱，不舒服。</p>
<p>我希望：乘客方面，各人自愛，一律排隊上車，任何人不得例外，可免上車軋痛的苦痛。循序而行，扒手無法下手，利己利人。上車前備就應付車資，省掉賣票員另找的麻煩。電車上嚴禁吸烟，注重公衆衛生！</p>
<p>公司方面，應該添加新車，加入行駛，車輛的多寡，視各線的需要，妥加分配。損壞車輛，加緊修復，務使物盡其用。</p>

<p>— 蘭天</p>
<p>我先談我的經騐：</p>
<p>提籃橋到外灘的電車，是我常走而必走的路綫。因爲提籃橋是猶太區吧，來往的碧眼黄鬚兒比較多，雖然是連國家也沒有了的民族，但排隊候車魚貫而立的作風，還是未可厚非的。因此該站起點，「大國民丰度」有時居然「斐然可觀」。不過有時車少了，人特別多了，怎辦呢？不消說，自然是擠。擠到電車久久開不出　是常有的事。這時那些　太，也就成了「淮北之枳」，無力無勇者祗好這篷三舍，再　下一次的運氣了！</p>
<p>近來打風很盛，售票員司機們對於打，也正像「打漁殺家」蕭老頭說的「如過年穿新鞋一樣的喜愛」着。因打架而停了的車，陰碍了後面的車，擁塞了左右一切的車——當然都不在話下。</p>
<p>十九日下午四點的樣子，從提籃橋趁車到南京路外灘，賣票竟和司機停了車下去和人打架。我不得不下來走；走到了中正路外灘，這打架的車子還沒有趕上來。那些十六舖站頭期待的乘客，豈不都是無謂的「不勝翹企」了？</p>
<p>住難，行亦不易，嗚呼上海！</p>

<p>有一天，我過馬路，從紅燈等到綠燈再立上片刻穿過去，走到對過，左邊橫裏過來一輛三輪車，猛不防撞得我眼睛發昏，還聽到一句「猪　」。</p>
<p>某日，從海寧路趁一路電車到虬江路，車上擠得水泄不通，我是後軋上去的當然只好站在門口，到虬江路車還未停妥，車門已開，我被乘客和售票員的催促只好跳下去，跌得手脚出血還被稱一句「屈死」。</p>
<p>又一天，從大世界趁公共汽車到同孚路，上車時在前推後擁中一疊千元券跟一個黑眼鏡短裝朋友去了，我發覺喊了一聲有扒手，車子到馬霍路站，他跳下車去回轉頭駡一聲「炒辣釀」。今天，在大新街趁無軌電車到北京路的途中，一枝自來水筆又不翼而飛，我恨極了，鄉下人竟一再被人欺侮嗎，不由操着我們家鄉官話發脾氣，乘客們有的大笑，售票員輕輕說「十三點」。</p>
<p>某晚，路經中正路，一個狐狸精跟着我說「白相去」，我大聲說幹甚麼，牠竟把我一推說「阿木林」。</p>

<p>更有一件事，我所認爲莫大遺憾　，就是在民二十六年夏間，因爲我們所住的平屋歷時已久，日見敝舊；而又到處留着亡兒榕的印象，使我們痛苦不堪，因此鳩工拆去，改造樓　；誰知八一三暴日入寇，工匠星散。只索半途而廢，單單　起了幾堵　，恰應了昔人「家徒四壁」的一句成語。九年來只因限於經濟，一再蹉跎下來，長滿了藤蔓野草，瞧上去倒活像是旁貝城的占跡，圓明園的殘址。徒供我們一家子俯仰憑弔而已！我們回來之後，就住在當時給兒女們暫住而蓋成的三間木棚子裏，實做了所謂「棚戶」。可憐你就在這木棚子裏侷促地住下來，雖說內部仍然佈置得楚楚有致，終不免有風雨飄搖之感；而四月二十三日那天，你就在這木棚子裏悄悄地咽了氣，連死也不得其所，眞使我中心耿耿，自覺一百二十個對你不起的。你的靈篆就設在中間的臨時客堂裏，這是一個月來使我牽腸掛肚的所在，白天十二小時中，出也叩一下磬，喚你一聲；入也叩一下磐，喚你一聲。每天一淸早起來，先敬你一枝香烟，然後點上了香，將茶，洗臉水，早點，水果，一一供在你的遺像和神主之前；我又總得到園子裏去瞧有甚麽新開的花朵兒，插在你左右和前面的三個古磁瓶裏，隨萎隨換，生香不斷的直到如今；這是我每天刻版的早課，不會忘掉的。午刻照例供飯供菜，挑一些你生前愛吃的東西；你病中曾說一春最愛吃的是新蠶豆和家園的春筍，到得筍豆上市時，身體也會好起來，就可照常吃一碗半飯了·我聽了很高興，便面託對門園地裏的老農，給我留意新蠶豆的成長，那知長得太遲，你竟等不得嘗新；直到你在仁濟殯儀館的那天大家吃飯時。却見桌子上來了一碟碧綠的新蠺豆，眞使我腹痛心酸，再也吃不下去！，從這一天起，每天午飯時除供上一二碗魚肉等　萊外，總少不了一碟筍炒新蠶豆，而今年竹林裏的笱又出得特別多，於是天天筍豆，從不間斷的直供到落市，不知你在冥冥中胃口如何？可也吃膩了沒有？至於飯後的一枝烟和四時左右的一頓點心，供上一杯奶粉可可以及麵包西點之類，我也忘不了你所愛吃的楊梅果醬，總要塗上了麵包供奉你，可是你吃到吃不到，又是一件不可究詰的渺茫的事了。</p>
<p>初喪時的幾天，四個女兒都在守蠶·還能天天哭你，但到了頭七和二七接着的那天，却只有葆妹和葉媽哭你了，雖有道士們鬧攘攘的誦經弄鈸，也掩不了凄淸寂寞的氣氛；眼瞧着運兒白衣如雪，獨個兒匍匐靈前，使我止不住掉下眼淚來，忙躱到園中最遠的一角去了。接着之後，葆妹回到了上海，於是三七四七，只有葉媽一個人哭你，哭得又是那麼凄楚，總使我在旁傷心陪淚。到了五月廿七日五七的前夜，保妹和錚兒梅兒都回來了，請了觀音堂七名僧人，做了一堂所謂「鋪血河」的佛事；第二天又由他們唸了一整天的經，不敢設奠打擾親友；可是張珍侯譜兄伉儷特地從上海趕來，向你拈香致敬，而年高德劭的鄒荊老也不曾忘懷這一天，惠然肯來，這樣的高誼隆情，使我一輩子銘感五中的。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, This Newspaper, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall descended the mountain from Kuling at 7:30 this morning. Chairman Chiang specially sent Director-General Huang Jen-lin to see him off. The reporter also accompanied him to the riverside. Marshal Ma and his entourage then crossed the river and boarded the plane at 9:30. According to Marshal Ma's aides, Marshal Ma stayed in Kuling for 85 hours. His residence was close to Chairman Chiang's headquarters, and he maintained contact with Chairman Chiang almost every day. He has gained a deep and new understanding of the government's attitude. When he left the mountain, he was smiling, symbolizing that the trip had yielded significant results. It is said that Marshal Ma had more confidence in the future of peace in China when he descended the mountain than when he ascended it. Marshal Ma's wife remains in Kuling.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, This Newspaper, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanking from Kuling at 10:30 this morning, landing at the Waijiao Airport. Among those arriving in Nanking were Military Secretary Pi Tsan-chun Tsung-kan, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Smerth, and two of Marshal Ma's adjutants. After getting off the plane, Marshal Ma was eager to return to his residence by car to avoid contact with the press and being surrounded by reporters. However, Marshal Ma did not answer any of the questions raised by the reporters. As for whether Marshal Ma brought any new opinion from this trip, Marshal Ma also refused to comment. However, according to reporter investigations, Marshal Ma did indeed bring a government opinion from Kuling to Nanking. Marshal Ma returned to his residence to rest immediately after arriving in Nanking. In the afternoon at 4:00, Ambassador Stuart visited Marshal Ma at his residence. Around 5:00, Yu Ta-wei made an appointment to visit. Yu refused to answer questions about the content of the discussion and whether any negotiations took place, only stating that Shao Lizi or General Xu Shuichang, one of the two, would definitely meet with Marshal Ma within a day or two. According to general observations, this symbolizes that the Three-Man Committee will be reconvened. It is heard that General Xu Shuichang will return to Nanking in the next few days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Central News Agency, 22nd] The local area is placing its hopes for important developments in the current situation on Marshal Ma's trip to Nanking, as Marshal Ma has taken the government's opinion to Nanking today. It is heard that the government's opinion is still based on the consistent policy of political resolution.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Washington, United Press, 22nd] News from various sources proves that Special Envoy Marshall's great efforts to promote internal peace in China are failing. If the Special Envoy cannot achieve his goal and returns home, it will only prove that he undertook an almost impossible task from the beginning, which will not affect his great abilities. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China has long been considered by well-informed sources to be unlikely to be resolved. President Truman's request for the Special Envoy to try to reconcile proves that the President refuses to admit its impossibility without first making a direct and great effort to resolve it. It is highly likely that the Special Envoy will return home for a rest immediately. However, even if the Special Envoy leaves without an agreement, it does not mean that the United States will stop its efforts to promote peace and security in China, both domestically and internationally. President Truman has appointed Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China. Ambassador Stuart is welcomed by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and he will continue to promote the work initiated by Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Washington, Associated Press, 21st] According to well-informed official sources, the achievements made by Marshall in promoting peace in China are currently unchanged compared to the previous months. Another report said that diplomatic and other qualified people in Nanking all believe that Marshall's efforts are doomed to failure, and he is scheduled to return to the United States in mid-August. However, according to the same source, this news has not yet been confirmed by people close to General Marshall here. Also, according to well-informed U.S. official sources, the rumors that Marshall and other U.S. officials have changed their original intentions are absolutely untrue.

<h3 id="e2">Before the Door of Negotiation is Completely Closed, It is Still Appropriate to Adopt a Political Approach; Minister Chen Corrects the United Press Report <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[News from This City] Yesterday, a reporter visited Minister Chen Lifu of the Central Organization Department to inquire whether he had replied to Mr. Zhou Enlai's letter requesting correction. Minister Chen said that he had not received a reply. The reporter further asked whether Mr. Zhou had said in Shanghai that Minister Chen had jointly instigated the Kunming assassination case, as reported by the United Press in its translation of Minister Chen's conversation with a reporter from the Nanking Central Daily News. Chen replied: "I have never mentioned this sentence to the Nanking Central Daily News. The news published by the Nanking Central Daily News on the 21st also does not contain this sentence. And as far as I know, Mr. Zhou only said in Shanghai that I strengthened the secret service organization in Shanghai and arranged new assassinations. I have already sent a letter of protest against this. It can be seen from the last sentence of the United Press's telegram, 'I requested Zhou Enlai to withdraw his statement in Shanghai that I was related to the Kunming political assassination, but I did not receive a reply,' that the United Press actually confused these two matters." Minister Chen also said: "I did not receive any reporters from the Central Daily News in Nanking a few days ago. I only briefly discussed the Communist Party issue with a friend from the newspaper. The content of the conversation published by the newspaper was probably obtained indirectly by the reporter, so it differs greatly from the original meaning. After being transmitted by the United Press's telegram, it is even more inconsistent. I said at the time that dealing with political issues is like treating illnesses. We must adopt the kingly way and not use hegemonic medicine. Therefore, if internal medicine can still cure the disease, we will definitely not resort to surgery. Based on this understanding, I have always advocated a political solution to the Communist Party issue. Recalling 1937, I was ordered to conduct political negotiations with the Communist Party. The Communist Party then issued a declaration of jointly facing the national crisis in September. In that declaration, they provided four promises, such as believing in the Three Principles of the People, obeying Chairman Chiang's command, abolishing the Red Army, and abolishing the Soviet regime. This was the first time since 1927 that our party and the Communist Party resolved issues through political negotiations. I consider the success of this negotiation to be a major accomplishment in my life. I still believe that unless the door of negotiation is completely closed, our party should still adopt a political solution." At that time, a friend from the newspaper asked: "If the facts prove that internal medicine cannot cure the disease and surgery is still promising, then would a good doctor also perform surgery?" I replied, "Yes. For example, with appendicitis, a good doctor will first use internal medicine. If it is proven that it will endanger life, surgery should be performed to remove it. This is truly a last resort and should be avoided as much as possible. Before performing surgery, the opinions of the patient's family must be sought, and it must never be done hastily." My opinion on resolving the Communist Party issue is nothing more than this. However, coming from my mouth, through the newspaper's pen, written indirectly, and then translated into English by the United Press, and then translated back into Chinese, it has gone through three procedures, so it is inevitable that it will differ greatly from the original meaning.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Wusih, Central News Agency, 22nd] The Communist Army used Jufou as a base to gather troops. Since the 13th of this month, they have been advancing on Nantong, but were stopped by the National Army in the southwestern Dingyenzhen and northwestern Paipuzhen areas. Until the 17th, they failed to succeed. On the 18th, they mobilized more than 30,000 people to encircle and attack the flanks of the National Army defending the area with all their strength, and used several groups to raid the National Army's rear transportation lines, attempting to eliminate the National Army in the area in one fell swoop and seize Nantong to control the Yangtze River. By the 21st, the National Army's positions had been breached many times. The National Army fought bravely for four days and nights with a ratio of one to six, and finally repelled the Communist Army. Division Commander Wang Tieh-han called the military here from his station at 8:00 p.m. on the 22nd, saying that the National Army on the front line of Nantong continued to repel the Communist Army's fierce attacks on the night of the 21st.

(3) At 1:00 a.m. today, the 89th Regiment of the 8th Column of the Communist Army's Central China District surrounded Nankung Village (3 kilometers north of Hsienniumiao), a stronghold on the Hsienshao Highway, with its entire force.

The National Army platoon leaders vowed to coexist with the positions. One man against a hundred fought fiercely for five hours and finally inflicted heavy damage on the invading Communist Army and repelled them. As of 12:00 noon, the death of Wan Kuo-lin, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Communist Army's New 6th Regiment, has been confirmed.

<h3 id="e19">Song Qingling Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation: Only Correct Implementation of the Three People's Principles Can Solve It <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Madam Song Qingling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen, yesterday issued a statement of opinion on the current situation, the main points of which are roughly as follows: "The current crisis is not a question of who wins or loses between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is a question of the Chinese people, as well as their unity, liberation, and livelihood. What should be weighed is not the rights of parties, but the rights of people. The people are eagerly hoping that the continuous negotiations can have some results, but every time a ceasefire agreement is barely reached, new conflicts arise. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot make a final decision; the final decision must belong to the people of China. The solution, although difficult, is very clear, that is, to correctly understand Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—and their correct implementation today." In her statement, she continued to explain the current significance of the Three People's Principles. She believes that: "The meaning of nationalism today is that China does not belong to the Kuomintang, nor does it belong to the Communist Party. China is a country, a nation. We must have a government that encompasses all the opinions contributed by all the people. The meaning of democracy today is that the Kuomintang's period of tutelage has passed, and the constitutional period must begin. The people of our country have endured hardship to reach this stage, and they have proven that they should have the right to self-government. Therefore, a 'coalition government' must be established immediately. Each party must elect its own representatives. The Kuomintang representatives must also be elected by party members. There are many capable and progressive party members within the Kuomintang who have never had the opportunity to speak. Now is the time to practice democracy in order to establish democracy. Once representatives are elected in a democratic manner, they can proceed to draft a constitution that will be recognized and approved by the people. The representatives must write into the constitution that the Chinese people should have their indispensable fundamental freedoms. People's livelihood today means that the people can no longer suffer from hunger, on the one hand allowing corrupt officials to accumulate wealth, and on the other hand causing loyal and upright officials to complain. The land issue must be resolved reasonably. This is not the agitation of the Communist Party or external forces, but the inevitable result of the logical development of our own history. A hundred years ago, peasant unrest led to the Taiping Rebellion. The people have the right to rise up against hunger. Feudalism and colonialism are undeniable facts. 'The tiller should have his own land' is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. This was passed in the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. This is the basic plan to cure China's famine. Distributing land to the tillers, this plan for the people's livelihood should be considered throughout the country." After explaining the Three People's Principles, she pointed out that "the Kuomintang must carry out its historical mission, leading the people from democratic politics and land reform to complete liberation. If this mission can be accomplished, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly be the leading party in any 'coalition government.' It will be supported by many people belonging to other parties, including those parties that have no army and are therefore unable to speak in negotiations." In this statement, she finally put forward her two demands: "(1) Demanding that the leaders of the two major parties of China, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as other parties and factions, immediately form a coalition government. (2) Asking American friends to promote this action by stopping all arms supplies and only allowing aid to be given to a government belonging to the Chinese people."</p>

<h3 id="e20">Chiang Ting-fu and Zhou Enlai Continued Negotiations Yesterday: Agreement Reached on Blocking the Yellow River Mouth; Agreed to Todd's Proposal to Maintain Existing Engineering; There is Talk of Large-Scale Layoffs at UNRRA <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Enlai, accompanied by his member Zhang Wenjin, CCP representatives Cheng Run, Wu Yunfu, etc., went to UNRRA yesterday morning at about 9 o'clock to continue negotiations on the Yellow River project issue. Those present on the UNRRA side included Chiang Ting-fu, Lai, the acting director of the UNRRA office in China, Vice-Director Persis, agricultural engineering expert Glenn, etc. The atmosphere of the meeting was extremely harmonious, and it concluded satisfactorily at around 11 o'clock. Regarding the blocking project, all parties agreed to adopt the suggestion of American Chief Engineer Todd.</p>
<p>Todd believes that at this time of rising water, efforts should be made to maintain the existing engineering to avoid losing previous efforts. The breach must be built with stone barriers to prevent the water power from completely rushing into the current channel. Although these stone barriers will cause the Yellow River water to flow separately into the new and old channels, it will definitely not endanger the residents along the old channel. At present, the blocking project cannot be carried out due to rising water. Work can only be resumed after the autumn floods in mid-September of the solar calendar. We should now prepare for all the materials and equipment needed for the resumption of work so that the blocking project can be completed by the end of this year. As for the residents who have moved into the old river channel in the past eight years, Director Chiang promised to jointly petition the central government with Chairman Xue of the Water Conservancy Committee to allocate at least 15 billion yuan within four months (August to November) to handle relief. This relief fund is specifically used for the procurement and transportation of materials needed in the CCP-controlled areas of the old Yellow River channel and will be managed by the CCP in conjunction with UNRRA. After the meeting, when the two Mr. Zhou discussed the relief issues in the CCP-controlled areas in the future, Director Chiang expressed that UNRRA is willing to set up more offices in the CCP-controlled areas to facilitate work. (Note that there are already two offices, one in Yantai and one in Heze). He is also willing to organize a survey committee, composed of representatives from UNRRA, UNRRA, and the CCP, to conduct a survey of the actual needs of the people in the CCP-controlled areas. This meeting has reached a concrete agreement. Regarding the exchange of routine official matters in the future, Mr. Zhou appointed Mr. Wu Yunfu as the CCP representative to be responsible for the liaison work between the CCP and UNRRA's UNRRA. Director Chiang promised to provide Mr. Wu with convenience in the above work.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is reported that Director Chiang Ting-fu is scheduled to go to Nanjing in the coming days to report to President Song on the situation of the UNRRA Far East Conference and the progress of the negotiations with Zhou Enlai on the Yellow River project, relief in the CCP area, and other issues.</p>
<p>[Another report] It is reliably learned that UNRRA is now preparing for large-scale layoffs. The original quota of staff in the department was only 600 people, but the total number of layoffs in the two head offices in Nanjing and Shanghai has reached about 1,300 people. Among them are some "appointed commissioners" who are hired and whose salaries are paid from business expenses. In order to vigorously reduce business expenses, they will be the first to be laid off. The personnel department of UNRRA is currently compiling the list, and it is reported that the first batch is mostly personnel from the general affairs department.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Rumor has it that UNRRA Plans to Reduce the Amount of Funds Allocated to Us <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Reuters] According to reliable UNRRA sources familiar with UNRRA's Far East affairs, the subcommittee decided on the 19th to reduce China's allocation by US$27 million for the remaining months of this year. This is because other places urgently need cash.</p>

<p>[Report from this city] Since the Control Yuan has been critical of UNRRA's accusations against the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration and its various branches, it has ordered local inspectors to jointly investigate the truth with the audit office at UNRRA and its branches in various places. Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Inspector here, has also received this order and has joined Yang, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Audit Office, and Li, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Audit Office, to start investigating the facts at UNRRA and the Shanghai Branch yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Senior US Officials Considering Banning Arms Shipments to China, Hoping to Promote China's Unification <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] United Press learned today that senior US officials are considering a complete ban on arms and weapons shipments to China, hoping to use this to promote US assistance in unifying China. According to those who know Marshal Marshall and his mission in China, Marshal Marshall will stay in China as long as he feels he can still help promote government policy, hoping to realize the final hope of China's unity. If all efforts to mediate peace fail, Marshal Marshall will turn to assisting in redefining US policy toward China. Washington officials are largely considering the issue of banning arms and weapons shipments to China in a mood of despair. This material under the Lend-Lease Act has been supplied to the National Government throughout the war and continued to be supplied even after the victory over Japan, so that the National Army could assist in disarming the defeated Japanese soldiers in China and dare to regain lost ground. More recently, the purpose of this supply was to strengthen China and make it a force in Asia. The value of this material received by China, including weapons, is more than US$1.5 billion. This material is all owned by the Nationalist Army, but the Communist Army has acquired a lot of Japanese equipment left behind by the Nationalist Army in the Northeast. Some Washington authorities deeply fear that if the Nationalist Army is not so well-equipped, it might cooperate with the Communist Party or be more obedient to American orders. However, the CCP's attitude is also tough, and some extremists in the party have reportedly advocated a military solution. According to foreign policy officials here, the United States cannot afford to withdraw from China and let it find its own way out. This is a real dilemma. China's civil war will raise some extremely difficult questions for US foreign policy: If the United States helps the National Government, will the Soviet Union help the Communists? If the United States does not interfere, will the Soviet Union and other countries do the same? Can the United States not take sides between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to prevent the great powers from being drawn into the vortex? Can the United Nations do anything about a civil war in one of the five great powers?</p>
<h3 id="e24">If the CCP's Actions are Consistent with the Rhythm, They are All Based on Secret Resolutions, Which Can Be Proven by the Facts of the Past Two Months <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing] According to the Democratic Society, when the National Army entered Changchun, it seized a secret resolution document of the CCP Central Political Bureau. Although the CCP has denied it, the spokesman of the Northeast Security Headquarters has refuted it item by item based on the facts, proving that the CCP's military and political actions are consistent with the secret resolution. When the reporter inquired about the opinions of the government officials in charge on this matter again, it was said that the CCP's various actions in the past two months can further prove that they are based on the first item of the secret resolution, which is to launch a partial military offensive, and the area is in the Northeast. Since the Northeast ceasefire order was issued on June 7, the CCP has continued to attack the National Army in the Lafa area, and the offensive of the Communist Army in other parts of the Northeast has not stopped. The movement of the Communist Army north of Harbin is frequent, and large-scale military operations are actively being prepared. Recently, the military offensive has been extended to Guan Nei, such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Shanxi, and Hebei, all of which have launched offensives. The second item in the secret resolution is to absolutely not resolve issues with the Chinese Kuomintang in consultation, and to use delaying tactics. This can be proved by the fact that in the past month or so, the CCP representatives have been unwilling to resolve issues when negotiating with the government, and have been delaying in every possible way, and have even hindered the progress of negotiations with actual military actions. The third item in the secret resolution is to provoke Sino-American relations. The CCP's July 7 declaration publicly launched anti-American propaganda, and recently kidnapped seven American soldiers near Qinhuangdao, all of which are provocative actions by the CCP against the United States. Other actions, such as the CCP strongly pointing out who in the Kuomintang is a hardliner and who is a moderate, intending to divide them, as well as using sob stories, creating bloody incidents, blaming the government, and inciting public unrest, are all in line with the secret resolutions of the CCP Central Political Bureau.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government Allocates Huge Funds to Conduct Land Reform in Various Counties</p>
<p>[Quick report from this newspaper, Hangzhou] Robbery cases have occurred frequently in various counties in Zhejiang Province. In order to carry out thorough suppression, the provincial authorities have allocated 30 million yuan as funds for supervising suppression in various districts, ordering teams to be dispatched separately for searching and encirclement and suppression. The situation is progressing smoothly. According to the reports of the commissioners of various districts to the Provincial Security Command, most of the bandits in various places are scattered soldiers and ruffians. As a result of the suppression, they have been disintegrated and scattered, with each group being less than 50 people, taking advantage of the gaps in the defenses of various counties to launch attacks here and hide there, forming a situation where the bandits leave when the soldiers come and the bandits return when the soldiers leave. This is especially true in the Siming Mountains between Ningbo and Shaoxing, the Yandang Mountains between Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Chuzhou, and the vast mountains on the border between Zhejiang and Fujian, which cover hundreds of miles and are the border areas between the two provinces and between counties. At present, land reform is being carried out to eliminate the source of bandits. The provincial government believes that ensuring local security is essential for promoting various restoration works, and has decided to allocate 10 million yuan to fund land reform in various counties. The county magistrates are responsible for presiding over the work, in order to completely eradicate the banditry.</p>
<p>An Explosion Occurred in a Hangzhou Cinema</p>
<p>The Meiqi Grand Theater in Hangzhou City, which had not been open for long, is located on the Lakeside of West Lake, renting part of the buildings of the Civil Education Center as its site. Unfortunately, an explosion occurred at about 10 pm on the 20th. The neighbors heard the sound and were very panicked. When the reporter learned of the incident, he rushed to the scene to investigate and recorded that inside the low wall on the right side of the theater, thugs had placed two packages of explosives in advance, which exploded one after another, causing a loud noise. At that time, five road maintenance workers, including Lu Yongtang, who were sitting on the low wall watching movies from the window, were injured and fell to the ground. In addition, Ma Lai, an employee of the First Section of the Transportation Department, also had his right calf injured by the explosion. The theater was showing a film, and the audience was shocked and scattered in all directions, and the order was chaotic. Fortunately, the military and police arrived at the scene immediately to maintain order, and no other tragedies occurred.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Dispatching Warships to Patrol Taihu Lake Regularly</p>
<p>The county government believes that the third, fifth, twelfth, and thirteenth districts of the county are all located along Taihu Lake, and lake bandits have been rampant in the past, and public security is worrying. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, it has promoted all local teams to cooperate with the National Army to form elite troops to implement suppression. After several rounds of encirclement and suppression, there are no traces of bandits in the districts along the lake. However, in order to eliminate the remnants of bandits, the naval force has dispatched warships to patrol the lake regularly to maintain water traffic. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Section of the county government has also dispatched personnel to various districts to conduct surprise household registration checks in order to eliminate the source of bandits.</p>

<p>Illegally Selling Materials and Requesting Impeachment by Telegram</p>
<p>The County Provisional Council believes that Zhu Ruqiu, the former director of the liquidation office of the pseudo-cooperative society, has illegally sold sealed materials and taken away all the more than 18 million yuan stored in the bank. Although the county government and others sent a telegram to the provincial government requesting an investigation, no results have been achieved so far. Therefore, on the 19th, a telegram was sent to Cheng, the Jiangsu District Inspector, requesting impeachment and investigation, in order to appease public opinion.</p>

<p>The Need for Grain is Urgent, and Personnel are Dispatched to Guard and Deliver it</p>
<p>The county owes 18,000 market stones of military grain, and the County Council has been informed by telegram from the provincial capital to stop purchasing due to the difficulties of the people of Jiangsu. However, the county government has received urgent telegrams from the provincial office and the 103rd warehouse, stating that the war in northern Jiangsu is intensifying, the troops are in urgent need of grain, and the purchase and dispatch must be limited and cannot be delayed. All the suspension of purchase will still be handled in accordance with the previous order until a clear order is issued. Personnel are dispatched to the districts to guard and deliver the grain, and they will deliver it to the city day and night.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Opening the Military and Political Impasse <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the evolution of the Chinese situation seems to have reached the stage of "when things reach an extreme, they change; when they change, they become fluid"! On the one hand, the restless activities of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu threaten the security of the Nanjing-Shanghai line, provoking the National Army to adopt a strategy of self-defense and counterattack. The government is also considering taking appropriate steps to restore order in many traffic lines and economically vital areas so that the people can live in peace and contentment. On the other hand, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart Leighton went to Kuling to have candid discussions with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and they have returned to Nanjing one after the other yesterday and today. It is rumored that the government's policy of political settlement remains unchanged and will be actively implemented. The Chairman's proclamation reiterating his position may be issued in the coming days, and Ambassador Stuart Leighton also said that if everyone works together, the situation will definitely improve in the short term. It is likely that the opening of the political stalemate is imminent. Therefore, despite the Chinese Communists' efforts to exaggerate the severity of the Chinese civil war to domestic and foreign audiences, to the point where some nervous Americans are even considering banning arms shipments to China, we believe that, whether viewed militarily or politically, the situation in recent days seems to have shifted from a direction of "dragging on" to one of potential resolution. We earnestly hope for the maturity of this trend, and especially pray that the military and political impasse will be broken as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This newspaper has long argued that the overall national situation today can no longer be "dragged on." Dragging on is detrimental to the country and harmful to the people. The common goal of the people is simple: only peace. And the fundamental way to achieve peace is only ten words: "nationalization of the military" and "democratization of politics." Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about "nationalization of the military." We ask the government and the Communist Party, especially the Communist Party, to recognize the principle of national supremacy. Respect Marshal Ma's impartial opinions, and earnestly implement the troop reduction plan based on the reorganization and unification scheme. The first step is to immediately cease all-out military operations and promptly relocate the Communist troops to designated areas, awaiting reorganization and unification by the military three-person group. Since the government has abolished the Kuomintang party branches within the National Army, if the Communist Party can have a great awakening and abandon the idea of using force, and become an ordinary political party like other parties, and integrate the troops into the National Army, in other words, "return the military to the nation," it would be a great blessing for both the Communist Party and the country. Mr. Hu Shih's telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong last year, earnestly advising the Communist Party, is exactly what those who advocate democracy and freedom want to say. He believed that as long as the Communist Party abandons military struggle and engages in political struggle, it may one day be able to come to power, just like the Democratic Party in the early days of the United States or the Labour Party in Britain after World War I. But if it does not change its old tune of using force, it will be tantamount to destroying the Communist Party's own future. Therefore, how to untie the "knot" of the military stalemate today depends entirely on a change of heart among the Communist Party's leaders. As long as they are willing to untie this "knot," the military can truly be nationalized, and everything can be easily solved. It can be said that one action solves everything.</p>
<p>The Communist Party may say: "(1) We hand over our troops, why doesn't the Kuomintang hand over its troops? (2) If we hand over our troops, will the Kuomintang 'slaughter' us?" In fact, these are all caused by unconscious suspicion. First, the Kuomintang no longer has a "party army" today. The troops commanded by our government today are all national troops, and the Kuomintang party branches within the National Army have already been abolished last year, as everyone has seen. Moreover, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, countless soldiers shed blood. Do we want to favor the Kuomintang and insist on considering these national troops who defended the country and resisted the enemy as the Kuomintang's "party army"? Therefore, to be honest, the only troops that do not obey the orders of the National Government today are the Communist troops. And only the Communist Party should immediately "return the military to the nation." Second, if the Communist troops are incorporated into the National Army, the Kuomintang can "slaughter" the Communist Party, which is even more absurd. If the government really had this idea, why would it first reorganize the Communist troops into the National Army? Moreover, such a practice would not be tolerated by the people of the country. Therefore, as long as the Communist troops can be sincere and consistent, stop fighting, wait quietly for unification, and be reorganized into the National Army, the military stalemate will definitely be broken.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "democratization of politics." We certainly know that there is no democracy or freedom in the Communist Party's "liberated areas" either. But in any case, we must first ask the National Government to take the initiative as soon as possible within its authority to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Since the Political Consultative Conference was held in January and passed five major proposals, these should be the general guidelines for the government to solve political problems in the future. The government only needs to strive for the implementation of these proposals, without wasting words on further consultations.</p>
<p>First, regarding the expansion of the government organization, the government can take the initiative to invite people from outside the Kuomintang to participate in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan to show the government's openness and transparency. As for how many parties and non-partisan individuals can participate, it depends on their sincerity. We believe that as long as the government has this sincerity, there will always be patriotic parties and people of insight willing to participate in the government and jointly take responsibility for handling national affairs. Second, regarding the National Assembly, since the government has decided to convene it on November 12 this year and will not postpone it again and lose credibility, it should actively prepare everything to avoid being caught off guard at the last minute. At the same time, it must consult with various parties separately to ensure that they meet each other with sincerity, disclose the list of representatives, and widely recruit people of insight from society, or even allow the members of the Fourth National Political Council to participate in the constitutional National Assembly, thereby demonstrating the government's spirit of seeking advice widely. As long as the government sincerely respects this National Assembly, we believe that patriotic people will also be willing to participate in drafting the constitution. Third, the Outline of Governance; Fourth, Military Issues. There is nothing more to say about these two proposals. The government is already gradually implementing them. It only needs to work harder in the future to achieve them one by one as soon as possible. But at the same time, we hope that other parties (especially the Communist Party) will also show sincerity and work together to achieve them. Fifth, regarding the revision of the draft constitution, we hope that the Constitution Drafting Committee will promptly base it on the consultation.</p>
<p>The modification principles of the Consultative Conference and the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Kuomintang Congress, both parties should refer to each other; aiming at the current national situation, propose a proper plan for the National Assembly to adopt. But in this regard, we should have a common understanding, that is, the National Assembly itself has the supreme power to draft the constitution, and no party, no individual, or any conference can have the power to bind the National Assembly.</p>
<p>We believe that the biggest mistake of the government today is that it has neglected the responsibility that the government should bear for solving the current political problems. A government is not like a party in opposition, which can only sing high-sounding slogans without implementing them. The government must be responsible to the country and the people. The so-called "political solution" should not only refer to a "negotiated solution," but rather refer to the government solving the problem with practical political methods. As long as the National Government substantially and quickly expands the democratic foundation of the government, sincerely convenes a national rather than a partisan National Assembly, truly implements the governance program agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, truly implements the troop reorganization plan, and truly carefully consults and revises the draft constitution, then we expect that unbiased citizens will definitely support the government, and well-intentioned parties will also participate in the government and jointly assume the responsibility of governing the country. The key to breaking the political deadlock lies in whether the government has the determination to take the initiative. And we predict that the government authorities are now facing the stage where they must make a decision.</p>
<p>"When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, one doubts there is no road; The willows are dark, the flowers are bright, and there is another village." We hope that the current political situation in China is also like this: the deadlock is broken, and everything becomes clear!</p>

<p>[Special Telegram from the Reconstruction Society in Tokyo on the 22nd] The Far East International Tribunal has resumed its sessions as the air conditioning equipment has been completed. General Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of National Defense of China, attended court to testify today. Qin wore a light yellow military uniform with medals on his chest. He first read his statement in Mandarin, which was then translated into English, and then from English into Japanese. The secretary of Judge Mei was designated by the presiding judge to serve as the translator. It is noted that Qin served as the acting chairman of Chahar Province, the mayor of Peiping, and a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee before the incident, and is well aware of the Japanese invasion of North China. Therefore, his statement is highly valued by all parties. Qin's testimony was presented both in writing and orally.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo on the 22nd] Deputy Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun today denounced Doihara Kenji as the chief culprit of Japan's invasion of China. It is noted that Doihara once served as a secretary in the Japanese Embassy in North China. The International Tribunal reopened today in an air-conditioned courtroom after a twenty-day recess. Qin stated in his sworn statement that Doihara should not only be held responsible for the invasion of North China, but also for the Mukden Incident of 1931. Qin was an arch-enemy of Doihara when he served as the Mayor of Peiping and Deputy Commander of the 29th Army. He pointed out four other Japanese officers as the culprits of the "July 7th" Incident. The Japanese had hoped to obtain special interests in Hebei and Chahar through negotiations. The culprits of the "July 7th" Incident were Commander Kashii Kiyoshi of the Tianjin Garrison Army, Brigade Commander Kawabe, Regimental Commander Mutaguchi, and Chief of Staff Sakai.</p>

<p>[United Press Paris on the 21st] The European Peace Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 29th of this month. Although it is recorded as a "peace" conference, this is only a political term and not a fact. This conference is like visiting a new house. The architects of the new house will guide those who will live in this house in the future to visit for a week. The architects themselves are not very satisfied with the structure of the house. As for the future tenants, whether they agree or not, they are generally not allowed to改造it. They can complain, but they cannot effectively order any changes. The so-called architects are the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. They have been drafting peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland for several months. The draft treaties have been completed, and representatives from seventeen other countries have been invited to send representatives to Paris to review them. They may not agree with these treaties (none of the four foreign ministers fully agree), but they cannot reduce them, and can only suggest some modifications. In the future, the four powers may consider the points that should be modified, but they do not need to redraft the treaties to include them. The Paris Conference is not a reproduction of the Versailles Conference and the Vienna Conference. Its essence is the compromise between the ideas of Britain and the United States and the ideas of the Soviet Union. Once the peace conference is over, the four foreign ministers will重come to work in Paris. At that time, the opinions of the seventeen countries have been heard, and the final decision will be made by the four powers. The opinions of the small countries will be classified separately, and it is unlikely to make people very satisfied. But politically, there is also a shortage of houses, just like anywhere else.</p>

<p>The Zhangbei Incident</p>
<p>In June of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], two Japanese military officers and two corporals went from Dolon to Zhangjiakou. When passing through Zhangbei County, they were not checked by the garrison at the north gate of the county and did not carry passes, which led to a dispute. At that time, the garrison in the county town took the four hundred people to the headquarters of Commander Tang Dengyu of the 132nd Division. Commander Zhao immediately asked General Song Zheyuan, commander of the 29th Army, for instructions, and allowed the Japanese soldiers to go to Zhangjiakou via Zhangbei, but stated that they must carry passports in the future. The Japanese and others then went to Peiping via Zhangjiakou. After the Japanese passed, Hashimoto, the Japanese Consul in Zhangjiakou, suddenly protested, saying that "Japanese military officers were checked by the garrison at the north gate of Zhangbei County and taken to the division headquarters for detention, which insulted the Japanese military and demanded punishment, apologies, and guarantees that the same incident would not happen in the future," and then said that "the consul has no right to negotiate, and this matter has been transferred to the Tianjin Garrison Army for handling, please negotiate with Major General Doihara Kenji, the representative of the Garrison Army." As a result of the negotiations: the regimental commander of the Zhangbei County garrison was dismissed as a disciplinary measure, and the chief of the military law department of the 132nd Division headquarters, who detained the Japanese military officers, was also dismissed as a disciplinary measure. China was not allowed to engage in activities in Chabei in the future, and anti-Japanese organizations and anti-Japanese activities in Chahar Province were banned. In order to seek peace, the Chinese government repeatedly made concessions, but the aggression of the Japanese warlords was endless. Although Takahashi Tan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, participated in the above-mentioned negotiations, the actual person handling the matter was Doihara Kenji.</p>
<p>Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>The bribery and coercion before and after the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. In September of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], when General Song Zheyuan was the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, Doihara was planning in Peiping to establish a North China government to separate North China from the central government. His methods of temptation were (1) to make Song Zheyuan the chairman of the North China autonomous government. (2) The Japanese side would do its best to assist in the military and economic affairs of North China. (The above two points were proposed by Doihara to Shen Zhen , the mayor of Peiping and Tianjin, but were rejected by our side.) Later, the central government appointed General Song Zheyuan as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and he handled matters in accordance with the instructions of the central government. At that time, the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction with the election of the National Assembly and the collective military training of university students. After learning that the temptation had failed, the Japanese turned to coercion. (A) Political relations: 1. Demanding that General Song Zheyuan issue a telegram announcing the establishment of the North China autonomous government. 2. Withdraw the central intelligence personnel in Peiping. 3. Control the speech in Peiping and Tianjin, and not oppose autonomy. (B) Economic relations: 1. Build the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway. 2. Revise the Tianjin tariff to increase the tax rate on European and American goods and reduce the tax rate on Japanese goods. (The above two items were rejected by our side.) (C) Military relations: The Fengtai Incident in September of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The incident was caused by a company of Japanese troops wanting to pass through our army's defense line during an exercise in Fengtai. Our defenders tried to stop them, and a conflict occurred. Although the incident was quickly resolved, the Japanese military took the opportunity to increase the strength of the garrison army to six battalions. The second incident was that retired General Matsui Iwane promoted the establishment of a branch of the Greater East Asia Association in Peiping in the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] and met with General Song and me. General Song and I expressed our disapproval of this. Matsui advocated that Asia should be Asia for Asians, and European and American forces should be excluded. I smiled and said that Asia for Asians may become Asia for the Japanese. If we really seek equality and mutual benefit, we should talk about other issues first.</p>
<p>The Lugouqiao Incident</p>
<p>Qin's second statement described the July 7th Incident in detail, stating that the organ responsible for the political affairs of Chahar Province in North China before the incident was the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the chairman was General Song Zheyuan. After the Japanese enemy invaded our three northeastern provinces on September 18, they continued to covet Rehe and seized various places in North China, and the railway between Peiping and Tianjin became the front line. Our army was mainly the 29th Army, fighting in various places in Chahar in North China and Peiping and Tianjin. The location where the July 7th Incident occurred was Lugouqiao, which is twenty li southwest of Peiping and is a strategic location in western Peiping. This was the second stage of the Japanese invasion of China. At that time, from the summer of the 24th year of the Republic [1935] to the spring of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the enemy, seeing that its political offensive and economic monopoly had failed, decided to use force to coerce. At 12:10 p.m. on July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], I received a report from the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, relaying a telephone call from Matsui, the head of the Japanese special service agency, that a company of the Japanese army was firing at the troops of the 37th Division near Lugouqiao. The training troops were in chaos for a while, and the roll call resulted in one soldier missing. Therefore, the Japanese army will enter the city tonight for inspection. I asked for instructions on how to deal with this by phone. I replied that the Japanese army's arbitrary exercise in our territory violated international law. Since there was no prior notice and I did not give any permission, I am not responsible for the missing soldier. If the soldier is indeed missing, immediately order the garrison at Lugouqiao to search with the local police. The Japanese army still strongly demanded to enter the city and decided to use force to surround the city if permission was not granted. Later, I asked if the Japanese army had any exercises last night, and the answer was that there were no exercises. At this time, the Japanese army surrounded Wanping City from three sides. At about 6:00 a.m., the enemy fired machine guns into the city, gradually approaching, and the Sino-Japanese war began. The fighting was fierce on the 8th and 9th, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Seeing that the battle situation was unfavorable, the enemy sent Matsui and others to negotiate on the 9th, saying that the missing soldier had been found and could be resolved peacefully. Therefore, negotiations began immediately, and the following three items were decided: (1) Both sides immediately cease fighting. (2) The troops of both sides are transferred to their original defense areas. (3) The garrison of Lugouqiao and Wanping City will be replaced by other troops, and an attached agreement will be added, so that the same incident will not occur in the future. However, the Japanese army regarded this clause as a delaying tactic and took the opportunity to transfer troops from Kwantung to Peiping and Tianjin to fight. On the 14th, the two sides fought again, and the fighting became increasingly fierce. This is the process and fighting situation of the Lugouqiao Incident. The main military officers of the enemy army who launched the incident were Kashii Kiyoshi, commander of the Tianjin Garrison Army, Kawabe, brigade commander, Mutaguchi Renya, regimental commander, and Sakai Takashi, chief of staff of the garrison army. Also, the chief of staff at the time of the incident was Hashimoto, but the first person to lead the occupation of North China was Doihara Kenji, who launched the September 18th Incident. After the statement was read, the defense lawyer questioned Qin.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Bolivian Capital, 21st] A popular revolution took place in Bolivia today, overthrowing the current government and establishing a revolutionary government of three members. President Villarroel has been assassinated.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Argentinian Capital, 21st] According to a radio broadcast from the Bolivian capital, a violent revolution has succeeded in Bolivia. Following the assassination of former President Villarroel, Colonel Chavantzi has assumed the office of President. According to other sources, the revolution was led by the People's Party, and Villarroel was assassinated by students. President Villarroel was first advising the crowds protesting against the government when he was suddenly shot and seriously wounded. He was immediately moved to the Presidential Palace by his guards, but the mob soon attacked the Presidential Palace, disarming the guards at the entrance and smashing the doors and windows. At that time, the President was lying in the hall, groaning. The mob carried the wounded President to a window and threw him into the street, literally tearing him apart. The body was then loaded into a truck and driven through the streets of the capital to the central square, where it was tied to a lamppost, and the crowd cheered. Villarroel came to power after the revolution on December 20, 1943. He led a movement of young military officers in cooperation with the National Revolutionary Movement. Six months later, his organized government was recognized by the United States and nineteen Latin American countries, but these countries all considered the government to have fascist tendencies. Villarroel tried to show his sincere participation in the United Nations' war effort and opposed the leftist parties in politics, which were excluded from the Congress, and their members were often subjected to brutal oppression.</p>
<p>Four Days of Street Fighting, Two Thousand Casualties</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bolivian Capital, 22nd] The leader of the Bolivian Revolutionary Party succeeded in his uprising and today promised to immediately restore the people's freedom. Fierce street fighting occurred during the four days of the revolution, with reports of 2,000 deaths and injuries. The military under the President suffered heavy losses during the revolution, but the majority of those killed and injured in the street fighting were members of the Revolutionary Party. The situation remains chaotic today, and the Revolutionary Party is trying to restore order. Some army soldiers and some of Villarroel's relatives narrowly escaped being beaten and humiliated by angry crowds and fled into the mountains. It is not yet possible to determine whether they intend to counterattack the Bolivian capital. The new government is composed of several prominent figures, including university professors, students, trade union groups, and the president of the Bolivian Supreme Court.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Maintaining Sovereignty Regardless of Loss: The Relief Transport Group is Formally Established, Eight Ships Head to North and South Ocean Lines Exclusively Transporting Relief Supplies, Meeting Again Today to Discuss Various Issues in Detail <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipowners' Association Relief Transport Group, in order to actively promote the transportation of relief supplies, various specific measures, held its first Relief Transport Committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at 20 Guangdong Road. All committee members Li Zhenguang, Xue Baokang, Li Yunliang, Hu Shizhou, Chu Yuyang, Dong Haoyun, Yu Shunwei, Cheng Yuqi, etc. attended. Hu Shizhou was elected as the chairman, Shen Qi as the director-general, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will designate four N3 seagoing vessels, and private companies will designate four seagoing vessels to replace the ships withdrawn by Taikoo and Jardine due to the termination of the charter agreement by the head office. China Xingyi Xiang, China Shipping, Shanghai Industrial and other companies are willing to dispatch one ship each to undertake the aforementioned task. However, because all colleagues are willing to fulfill their obligations to maintain the navigation marks, the names of all designated ships will be jointly decided at the plenary meeting convened on the 25th of this month. The remaining ships will still fully transport relief supplies, and the losses incurred from undertaking this task will be shared by the colleagues according to the tonnage of all ships on the respective shipping lines. Shen Qi, the director-general, will be responsible for presiding over various affairs of the Relief Transport Group. Important matters will be decided by the Relief Transport Committee. Currently, Shanghai Industrial Company's Da Shanghai vessel has been allocated to load 6,000 tons of relief supplies to North China. Shou Kang Shipping Company's Qingyun vessel has loaded 4,000 tons of relief supplies to Hankou. Yi Xiang Shipping Bureau's Limin vessel and China Xing Shipping Company's Qixing vessel have loaded relief supplies and sailed to Fuzhou and Xiamen. The number of Chinese merchant ships is increasing day by day. All shipping companies are extremely vigilant about the attempts of British merchants Taikoo and Jardine to infringe on navigation rights and are making concerted efforts to salvage the current serious crisis in the shipping industry with practical actions.</p>
<p>Another report: According to the person in charge of the Relief Transport Group, the group's business is solely responsible for the transportation of relief supplies, and the freight is calculated at 75% of the rate stipulated by the Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, in reality, shipping companies have no profit to make from this initiative. There are a total of eight ships, with a total of more than 20,000 tons. Four ships have been designated to operate on the North Ocean Line and four ships on the South Ocean Line. In fact, in addition to these designated eight ships, all ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies have the obligation to be dispatched by the Relief Transport Group. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has even repeatedly stated that the company's ten ships operating on the North and South Ocean Lines and Fuzhou and other places are willing to be dispatched by the Relief Transport Group at any time. Therefore, there are no difficulties in the future development of the group's business. In order to discuss in detail the various organizational and dispatching technical issues of the Relief Transport Group, the group is scheduled to hold another meeting this afternoon to discuss collectively.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Taikoo Ship Infringes on Our Navigation Rights: Shipping Industry Sends Urgent Appeals <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipowners' Association sent urgent appeals to the Superintendent of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, the Minister of Communications, and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau to prevent the Taikoo shipping company's Nanchang vessel from clearing customs. The original text is recorded as follows: "Reported that Taikoo shipping company's British merchant vessel Nanchang is scheduled to load cargo and passengers from Shanghai and sail to Wenzhou on the 25th of this month, which violates the treaty and maritime regulations. Please prevent customs clearance to maintain sovereignty and prevent covetousness. Still awaiting instructions, Du Yong, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipowners' Association, respectfully kowtows, midday support."</p>
<p>According to Li Yunliang, secretary-general of the Shipowners' Association, this is a factual manifestation of the British merchants' declaration. Its purpose is to test whether the Chinese government and people are determined to maintain navigation rights. Currently, the French vessel Yi Xing has also made the same attempt. The Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Maritime Bureau to prevent it, but it failed to achieve the purpose of soliciting merchant cargo and engaging in economic aggression. Currently, there are several ships, such as Xin Rui An, Zhoushan, Chuanshan, and Dahua, operating on the Shanghai to Wenzhou route on a regular schedule. If the British re-enter the competition, the original national ships will inevitably be squeezed out. In addition to submitting the matter to the maritime authorities and customs for attention, the shipping industry is closely monitoring this attempt to infringe on navigation rights and will do its utmost to prevent it.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Tan Zhuang and Chen Lingfeng Went Out to Visit Friends: Deng Yingchao Misreported Their Disappearance, They Returned Safely the Next Day and it was Discovered There Was No Other Reason, A Moment of Nervousness Troubled the Police Officers <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Enlai's wife, Deng Yingchao, because Communist Party members Tan Zhuang and Chen Lingfeng went out on the afternoon of the 20th and did not return home at night, suspected that something had happened and telephoned Mayor Wu at 11:00 AM the previous morning, stating that Tan and Chen had suddenly disappeared and were afraid that they had been arrested by the government, and requested a speedy investigation and release. Mayor Wu immediately told her that the arrest by the government was definitely not true, but promised to conduct a thorough investigation and search. He immediately ordered the Police Bureau to carry out a search. By about 4:00 PM that day (21st), the Police Bureau had learned that Tan and Chen had returned safely, and reported this to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu then telephoned Deng to inquire, but Deng did not confirm it. To be cautious, the Police Bureau first inquired by telephone and confirmed that Tan and Chen had indeed returned home, and then the Police Bureau sent personnel to inquire about the course of events. It was stated that they had purely gone out to visit friends and there was no other reason. They stayed overnight at a friend's house that day, which led to this misunderstanding. Tan Zhuang is from Guangdong, 34 years old, and is the chief surgeon of the Yan'an Peace Hospital. Chen Lingfeng is from Changsha, Hunan, 30 years old, and is the director of the Yan'an Experimental Farm. They departed from Yan'an in early June and arrived in Shanghai on June 29, and both will go abroad to the United States for observation. Tan and Chen have been in Shanghai for many days but have not registered their household registration. Because the Shanghai area is vast and the political parties and groups are complicated, making protection difficult, the Police Bureau has informed the Communist Party to register their household registration in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Police Bureau's Investigation Process <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The police bureau's investigation of the matter is summarized as follows: After receiving the mayor's notification, the bureau immediately dispatched a section chief and Zhao, the chief of the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, to Zhou Enlai's residence at 107 Rue Massenet to request an inspection of his residence, but the request was denied. When asked about the relatives and friends they had contact with, they only replied that there were few relatives and friends in Shanghai, and as a result, nothing was gained and they returned in vain. Later, it was learned that two men and women had visited Tan and Chen's house in a Jeep No. 13465 on the afternoon of the 20th. It was later learned that the vehicle belonged to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They searched everywhere, but to no avail. At about 4:45 PM that afternoon, the Municipal Police Bureau received a secret report stating that someone had witnessed Tan waiting for a tram at the Sichuan North Road and Haining Road tram station at about 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. Based on this report, it was determined that they were in the area north of the Suzhou River. At about 50 minutes past the hour, a phone call came again stating that Tan had inspected a hospital in Jiangwan, and personnel were immediately dispatched to investigate various hospitals. Later, it was learned at the Army Hospital that Tan had indeed stayed in the hospital last night, but had left the hospital at 4:30 PM this afternoon (21st). The police officers received this good news and returned to Shanghai and drove to Zhou's residence on Rue Massenet. At this time, Tan and Chen were already there. According to Chen, at about 11:00 AM that morning, he went to UNRRA with Ellers, a consultant, to discuss his passport for going abroad. After leaving, they parted ways. He went to Fuzhou Road to shop and met a friend, Chen Guang, who invited him to his home. He stayed overnight and did not return until 5:00 PM today (21st). He did not meet anyone along the way. According to Tan, after leaving UNRRA that day, he returned to his residence once at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Fearing that he would not be able to return to Shanghai that night when he went to Jiangwan, he left a note under Chen's pillow. There were no unexpected events during the night in Jiangwan.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Mixing Kerosene and Gasoline for Sale: Many Fires Are Caused by This, Fire Department Samples Retailers <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Many fires in this city are caused by the use of impure kerosene. Because kerosene is more expensive than gasoline, unscrupulous merchants often mix gasoline into kerosene without authorization to make huge profits. However, gasoline is extremely flammable, and a slight carelessness can easily cause disaster, which is extremely dangerous. The police bureau's fire department began dispatching personnel yesterday to sample retail stores to prevent abuses. At the same time, a simple identification method was announced for citizens' reference. (A) Color Identification: Pure gasoline should normally be a slightly bluish-white liquid, but gasoline on the market is generally red. If 10% of gasoline is mixed into kerosene, there will be a light red phenomenon. (B) Combustion Identification: Pour a very small amount of kerosene into a small iron can or ceramic dish and ignite it with a match. If it is pure kerosene, it will not ignite. If all the matchsticks are immersed in the kerosene, the flame will be extinguished again. Then ignite it with another match, and the surface of the kerosene will begin to burn. If the kerosene contains 5% gasoline, the entire surface of the kerosene will begin to burn after about three seconds when ignited with a match. If the kerosene contains 10% gasoline, the entire surface will burn immediately after a spark passes.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Prison on Huade Road in this municipality is grand in scale and solidly built, standing out as a leader among prisons in the Far East. It has a total capacity of over ten thousand prisoners. To date, fewer than three thousand are detained there, including war criminals, traitors, and opium offenders. Therefore, many prison cells remain vacant. Recently, the prison received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration stating that all special criminal traitor cases tried in various locations, where judgments have been finalized and execution is warranted, must be transferred to Shanghai for execution. Consequently, prisoners currently detained in Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places, such as Chen Bi-jun, will be transferred to Shanghai Prison in the coming days. The first batch of over thirty prisoners being escorted to Shanghai from other locations is expected to arrive within this month.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The High Court pronounced judgments in several traitor cases yesterday morning by a collegiate panel. She Ai-zhen, wife of Wu Shishi, the "76" puppet secret service demon, was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for seven years, and all her property was confiscated, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of her family. After reading the main text of the judgment, the presiding judge explained to the defendant, "Your crimes are significant; we initially intended to sentence you to fifteen years. However, because you left the puppet secret service headquarters on June 1, 1944, your sentence has been reduced by half. If you disagree, you may appeal for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." She Ai-zhen was still dressed in a black Xiangyun shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun. Upon hearing the verdict, she looked tearful and sorrowful. This former "wealthy woman" declared to the court, "My children currently have no place to live; what should I do?"

<p>[Our Dispatch] The actual date of the 80th birthday of Madam Lu, the mother of President Sun Fo, is on the 27th of this month. President Sun could not be present on that day because he had important official business to attend to in Nanjing. Therefore, he took advantage of his presence in Shanghai, attending to his mother yesterday, to offer her congratulations and celebrate her birthday. At the same time, this day happened to be the 34th wedding anniversary of President Sun and his wife, Madam Chen Shu-ying. Therefore, yesterday was a day of double celebration at the Sun residence. At 6 PM, the quiet Columbia Road suddenly became lively in the sunset as cars drove towards President Sun's residence one after another.

Initially, Mrs. Wei, Zheng Yu-xiu, was waiting for Mr. Wei and called the residence twice to inquire because he hadn't arrived.

<p>[Our Dispatch] The news that the trial of Wen Lan-ting, one of the "Three Old Men of Shanghai," for suspected treason has been postponed was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after the High Prosecutor's Office filed the public prosecution, the High Court originally scheduled the trial for yesterday, but when the summons to appear in court was delivered to the prison, he never signed it. He resolutely stated that he did not want to appear in court and said, "Please ask President Song to come to the court; then I will appear." On the 20th, his defense lawyer, Zhu Fu-jiu, also submitted a statement to the High Court, requesting a postponement on the grounds that the evidence collection was not complete. Therefore, the trial was not held yesterday. However, yesterday afternoon, a large number of reporters and people who wanted to attend the hearing were still very crowded at the High Court, but they all returned in vain. Yesterday, a reporter specially visited Xu, the warden of the Shanghai Prison, who said that Wen currently refuses to appear in court for trial. If he is forced to appear, he is old and weak, and an accident may occur, so he has been granted a postponement. As for how to handle the situation, they are currently discussing and requesting instructions. A person in charge of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court told reporters that Wen is currently ill in prison and showed reporters a certificate from the doctor, which read, "After examination, the defendant Wen Lan-ting suffers from scrotal swelling, weak lower legs, dizziness, and other symptoms, making movement difficult. This is hereby certified. Doctor Dai Yuan-ru, 35.7.22," and stamped with a seal. It is currently uncertain when the Wen case will be tried. However, according to reporters from reliable sources, it will be several weeks.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Anyone who reads and writes has the habit of reading newspapers and magazines, but most people's "spiritual food" comes from the newsstands all over the streets.</p>
<p>However, recently, these newsstands will no longer appear on the roads because the police are trying to improve the appearance of the city and improve traffic, and have decided to ban them. Yesterday afternoon, the Newspaper Supply Industry Association hosted a press conference to report their personal pain and hoped that the publishing and media circles would appeal to the authorities on their behalf.</p>
<p>Now, the street vendors are preparing to make another request, hoping that this matter can be resolved reasonably, or at least whether a compromise can be adopted, such as stipulating and restricting the locations where they set up.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Civilian Jeeps, No Official Documents Received in This City <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The ordinance on civilian jeeps was announced by the Ministry of National Defense on the 16th. Yesterday, a reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau to inquire about the procedures for civilian jeeps to obtain licenses in this city. According to the discussion, the department had requested instructions from the Ministry of National Defense a month ago, but has not yet received official documents. If the ordinance on civilian jeeps is as announced in the newspapers, its regulations seem ambiguous. For example, Article 2 stipulates that transfers should be registered with the Ministry of National Defense, but most civilian jeeps are currently purchased from the Relief Administration or the US military. Should they also be registered? Also, Article 3 stipulates that they should be painted in dark colors to distinguish them. What dark color does this refer to, and is the currently popular khaki color in compliance with the regulations? The legislators may not have considered all of these factors, but the executive agencies find it difficult. Therefore, when civilian jeeps can start obtaining licenses depends on the situation after the department receives official documents.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Purchase of Jeeps, Inspecting the Goods First Today <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>

<p>[Our Dispatch] A reporter learned from transportation circles yesterday that the major stations on the Beijing-Shanghai Line will be rebuilt. That is, Shanghai North Station, Nanjing Station, Wuxi Station, Zhenjiang Station, etc., will all be planned for reconstruction. After the war, the transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has become increasingly busy, and passenger and freight transportation has become more and more crowded. In addition to preparing to purchase vehicles for use, the Transportation Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration is currently drafting plans to improve the above-mentioned stations. It is reported that the freight and passenger transportation at Shanghai North Station is becoming increasingly inconvenient. The Railroad Bureau intends to convert the Fanhuangdu West Station into a passenger terminal, and the freight terminal is planned to be located in Wusong to meet transportation needs and facilitate the flow of goods. However, the above plan has not been completely decided, and after the decision is made, it may be difficult to realize this year due to limited funds. However, the Railroad Bureau is actively working on various improvements to the North Station.</p>
<h3 id="e80">One of the Three Small Popular Stocks, A Visit to the Jingfu Factory <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] When the Jingfu Shirt and Sock Factory was established in 1937 in Dapu Bridge, Xujiahui, it was just a partnership organization with only a few people. The capital was small and the scope was narrow. After years of hard work by Director Xu Wen-zhao, it gradually moved forward, from a partnership to a limited company, from a capital of 15 million puppet Central Reserve Bank notes to the current capital of 200 million legal tender. Jingfu's stock is one of the three small popular stocks on the stock market today!</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter was invited by the Jingfu Shirt and Sock Factory to observe one of their crystallizations, the No. 2 Factory. The No. 2 Factory is a brand-new building, covering an area of about ten mu. There are more than 300 male and female workers in total, and there are also 50 or so technical workers. Stepping into the factory building, the ears were enveloped by the rumbling of the locomotives! It is said that the equipment in the knitting department includes a total of 39 Tomkins cotton undershirt and health undershirt knitting machines. There are 80 various sewing machines. There are 12 ribbing machines. The equipment for woven fabrics includes 40 Toyota looms. The dyeing and finishing department has all the bleaching and dyeing machines and baking rooms. The finishing department has two raising machines and two calendering machines. In order to supplement the lack of power, they are also equipped with diesel engine generating equipment.</p>
<p>Jingfu's main products are currently Feima brand undershirts, cotton undershirts, health undershirts, knitted underwear, and woolen and fine cloths. It is said that the monthly output of knitted products is more than 10,000 dozens, and woolen and fine cloths are about 3,000 pieces. Seventy percent of the products are sold in this city, and the remaining thirty percent are distributed to Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other places.</p>
<p>The workers in the factory have a stable life. On average, a technical worker can earn about 300,000 yuan per month in addition to food and lodging. The average wage for ordinary workers is about 200,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>At this time, when domestic manufacturers are struggling to move forward, and manufacturers are often lamenting pessimistic statements that they cannot continue to operate, in the process of visiting yesterday, I did not hear the Jingfu authorities shout the same pessimistic statement to reporters. On the contrary, Jingfu expressed that they would speed up production and strive to win over the Southeast Asian market. The reporter is willing to promote this display of perseverance to those pessimistic domestic manufacturers.</p>

They assigned police officers Cui Jinchuan, Gu Zhicheng, and Zhang Shikang, disguised as rickshaw pullers and vendors, to keep watch in the area. On the morning of the 19th, at 7:00 AM, Yu and Zhu Jiajun were seen going out for breakfast, and the two were immediately apprehended. A six-and-a-half-inch pistol with seven bullets was found on Yu. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, Yu confessed that in November of last year, he had conspired with Duanmu Licheng, Xu Wenhua, Xiao Bao, and others to rob many overcoats from the Hongfa Fashion Company on Hart Road. He also admitted that on May 10th of this year, he had conspired with Zhang Yunpeng, Xi Zhanru, Yu Zhiliang, and Xiao Yang to rob the property of Lu Ronggen at No. 21, Lane 136, Xiamen Road. Zhu Jiajun, he claimed, was just a neighbor and not involved in the robberies. Subsequently, Director Shen of the branch bureau dispatched officers to No. 1 Xijiawan to arrest Xi Zhanru. Then, Officer Fan led the original investigators to Suzhou, where they, together with the local authorities, apprehended Zhang Yunpeng and Yu Zhiliang at No. 40, Sizhang Lane. A six-inch pistol with three bullets was also found under Zhang's bed. Witnesses and evidence were transferred to Shanghai for a joint trial. One gold watch and one gold bracelet were also retrieved.

Expenditure on county education funds should be fully allocated based on actual income. (2) The original education funds and properties of each county should be separated from local public funds and properties, and a management committee should be organized to manage them. A thorough inventory should be conducted, and any assets that have been encroached upon or lost during the war should be investigated and recovered. (3) Each county's education funds should be established as a special education fund in accordance with regulations. If such a fund has already been established, it must be implemented according to the plan. If not, the plan should be established according to the instructions and forms issued by the Provincial Government in the preceding year, as well as the annual instructions and attached regulations, and the establishment should be completed as soon as possible. (4) Fundraising activities for education and raising funds for schools at all levels should be conducted by the county governments, and the campaign to donate to schools should be expanded. To respect the intention of the people's donations, starting from the 34th year, donations designated for specific purposes may be stored and used exclusively for those purposes. (5) The original school properties of each county should be allocated to schools at all levels as school assets, and teachers and students should be encouraged to cultivate the land themselves. The Provincial Government has already distributed the implementation measures for allocating school fields to schools in each province, county, and city in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan. If there are any difficulties, they should be reported promptly for verification. (6) School properties in each county, including those accumulated by landlords, and all private middle schools, should be exempt from rent and all levies, preferential treatment fees for soldiers, and all apportionments. However, each school should provide free education to the children of soldiers. In addition, the financial department will not charge transfer fees when school properties are transferred. (7) Counterfeit assets in each county, after being confiscated by judicial organs, should be allocated to educational institutions or schools as education funds and properties. The Provincial Government has decided to instruct the Zhejiang office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to reply that counterfeit assets should still be received and managed by that office or its branches. The matter has been submitted to the head office for approval and will be subject to further regulations. (Butterfly)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Fujian Provincial Department of Education Holds Summer Class to Train Mandarin Education Personnel <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou] The Fujian Provincial Department of Education believes that language is one of the elements that constitute a nation. When people cannot easily understand each other's language, it is difficult to achieve effective unity. The complexity of dialects in Fujian Province is greater than in any other province. Often, languages vary greatly even within tens of miles, making it impossible to communicate. This greatly affects cultural communication and national unity. Therefore, in order to cultivate Mandarin education teachers in the province and strengthen the promotion of phonetic symbols to popularize Mandarin teaching, the department is taking advantage of this year's summer vacation to hold a training class for Mandarin education personnel. It is stipulated that each county and city should select one Chinese teacher from junior high school or simplified normal school to attend the class. The main subjects of the training include phonetic symbols, Mandarin pronunciation, Mandarin practice, Mandarin teaching methods, Mandarin grammar, and a brief history of the Mandarin movement. Experts are invited to serve as professors. The training period is set for one month. Registration begins on the 5th of next month, training begins on the 16th, and the class concludes on September 15th. After graduation, they will be assigned back to their respective counties and cities to teach and promote Mandarin.</p>

<p>The internal equipment and layout of the stock exchange market are being actively promoted. All unsuitable equipment in the old stock exchange market has now been completely dismantled. The mezzanine floor has also been started, torn down and relaid. The more than twenty tenants in the mezzanine will also move into the building within one or two days. The original third-floor office of the stock exchange is also being actively arranged. The preparatory work for internal affairs of the stock exchange, such as various account books, formats, and printed matter such as receipts, is also being expedited. It is said that in the future, the market will be equipped with loudspeakers to report market prices, and each broker will have loudspeakers directly connected to the market, so various market prices can be reported to each broker at any time. Each broker will also be allocated a telephone line directly connected to the market to facilitate transactions. It is reported that the laying of cables by the Shanghai Telephone Company on Jiangxi Road has reached the intersection of Hankou Road and Henan Road.</p>
<p>Preliminary Review of Broker Qualifications</p>
<p>The three members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee's Broker Qualification Review Subcommittee began to open the more than 600 broker applications one by one yesterday morning at 9:00 AM for preliminary review. The work continued throughout the day, and by 6:00 PM, only one-sixth of the total number had been opened. The opening will continue from 2:30 PM this afternoon. It is estimated that the preliminary review can be completed in about three or four days. Then it will be submitted to the entire preparatory committee for review. It is estimated that the entire review of broker qualifications will take three weeks.</p>
<p>Both Types of Qualifications Have Advantages</p>
<p>It is reported that among the more than 600 broker applications received by the stock exchange, banks and trust companies account for more than 100. According to regulations, banks, trust companies,, etc. that apply to be brokers must have been operating in Shanghai for at least five years. Therefore, there are restrictions on newly established banks. The reporter then inquired about the fact that the financial strength and reputation of banks and trust companies applying to be brokers must be better than those of individuals, which may affect the business of individuals in the future. It is acknowledged that this may not be entirely true. Customers often have to fill out a power of attorney to entrust banks and trust companies to buy and sell securities, and all procedures are carried out step by step, which is more complicated. Individual brokers are more accommodating. Therefore, the business of the two has its own merits, and it cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Not Many Applications from Foreign Merchants and Foreign Shares</p>
<p>Most of the 42 Chinese members of the old Public Brokerage Association have applied to be brokers of the stock exchange. However, among the 58 foreign members, only a few have applied to be brokers. Few foreign stocks have come to request listing applications. It is said that most foreign stocks have recently started to register in order to be reorganized. It is estimated that the reorganization will take at least six months. As of now, 106 listing applications have been sent out. However, because the information to be filled in is quite complicated, none have been filled in and returned.</p>
<p>Original Stock Exchange May Be Renamed</p>
<p>It is reported that the original Chinese Stock Exchange plans to convene a joint meeting of all directors and supervisors in the near future to discuss reorganization and convene a shareholders' meeting. It is said that its name will be changed to Huashang Investment Company, because the new stock exchange has a capital of 100 million yuan, and the old stock exchange will join in a group posture, accounting for about 60% of the total capital.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Grain Review Committee Reduces Negotiated Prices, Rice Shops Selling Coarse Rice Must Complete Joint Guarantee Procedures Within the Deadline, Licenses Will Be Revoked If They Do Not Comply With the Social Affairs Bureau Within Three Days <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[By our reporter] The Grain Price Review Committee, which has been suspended for five days, met at the Bureau of Social Affairs at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those present were Section Chief Ji of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Qian Xingzhong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhao Xingjie of the Shanghai General Warehouse, Zhang Xichao and Hu Xiangang of the rice shop industry, Cai Shengming and Yin Fuxiang of the rice industry, etc. Considering that rice from Sichuan, Jiangxi, Changshu, and Wuxi, etc., and foreign rice have been continuously transported here recently, the city's grain supply has become more abundant, and the market price has trended downward, the committee decided to slightly reduce the prices of various types of rice.</p>
<p>Type Negotiated Price</p>
<p>White Geng Thin Rice 64,000 yuan</p>
<p>Yang Xian 63,000 yuan</p>
<p>Bu Jian 58,000 yuan</p>
<p>Nian Jian 53,000 yuan</p>
<p>Bai Jian 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rice stores sell rice at the above prices plus the cost of handling and labor at the warehouse, plus a legal profit of 6%. For example, white geng thin rice will retail for 69,500 yuan. From today onwards, rice shops must not sell rice above this newly negotiated price.</p>
<p>[Also reported] In the past, grain merchants in the city were unable to circulate funds for selling coarse rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi. They requested the municipal government to sell it off and return the funds. After Mayor Wu agreed, he ordered them to complete the joint guarantee procedures for three rice shops first to ensure it. It is not known that the rice shop industry has not yet gone to clear it. Yesterday, Section Chief Ji of the Grain Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs told reporters, "I have just received Mayor Wu's order that if the rice shops do not go to the bureau to complete the procedures within three days, their business licenses will be revoked immediately."</p>
<p>[Also reported] The first batch of new coarse rice from Pudong was listed on the market yesterday, with an opening price of 44,000 yuan. Afterwards, it will come in a steady stream. Yesterday, a total of 13,400 shi of geng and xian yuan rice arrived in the north and south markets. Digestion was sluggish. High-quality goods were down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium and low-grade geng jian fell sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bai yuan also fell by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was weak. Oil prices were firm. Soybean cake was down another 100 to 200 yuan. Broad beans continued to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Only raw peanuts were scarce, and the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The digestion of wheat by scattered households in various ports was more active, and the price rose by 700 to 800 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Yarn Sales Are Dull, Cotton Is Currently Strong <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and powerless. Although the output of yarn mills was reduced due to power outages, the minds of the peers were very high. However, the actual demand was insufficient. Therefore, Ma Chenchu once issued 140,000 yuan, and then returned to 138,000 yuan at the close. Small and medium-sized yarns were also very mediocre, generally not much different from the market at the end of last week. Only 20-count cone yarn rose in price by 40,000 yuan because a certain large pure weaving factory absorbed a large amount. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual. 20-count yarn was supplied by Baoguang and Nikko, and the price was similar to the market price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be strong. The price of American cotton was easy to rise and difficult to fall. The bottom of the Shanghai port gradually dried up. Those who held spot goods were still hoping for higher prices and had no intention of depreciating. As a result, it was not easy for the buying and selling parties to reach an agreement. Factories did not open at all. Only the cotton number was slightly embellished. American cotton was closed on Saturday, and there was no electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Saving the Industrial and Commercial Crisis, Four Recommendations from Trade Associations, Please Ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Promptly Adopt the Central Government <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Due to the current serious industrial and commercial crisis, the trade associations of the city invited members to discuss the matter for many days and proposed four recommendations. A letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for review and deliberation, and then forwarded to the central government agencies for adoption and implementation. The four recommendations are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) Strengthen the Specialization of Banks</p>
<p>The China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Agricultural Banks each have their own history and mission. To adapt to the needs of wartime, the Four Banks Joint Office was established. However, the office not only separates the powers of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, but also turns the bank into a yamen. Although the government currently stipulates that the funds of specialized banks should be used in specialized fields, not less than 50%, it also restricts loans of more than 30 million yuan, which must be reviewed by the Four Banks Joint Office for several months. The agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors urgently need loans, so how can they be so leisurely? Therefore, the Four Banks Joint Office must be abolished as soon as possible. The Central Bank must fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank, handling rediscounting and refinancing businesses, while dispelling the illusion of shrinking bank accounts, reducing the statutory deposit reserve rate, and putting it to good use.</p>
<p>(2) Expedite Production Loans</p>
<p>In the past, the government's total amount of industrial loans accounted for only 2% of the annual expenditure due to its single-minded obsession with austerity, which was a major mistake. Our country's agriculture has been suffering from years of war and needs to be rescued urgently. The Farmers Bank should urgently handle loans to rescue agriculture. The conditions for industrial loans must be studied in light of the actual situation of each factory, and the necessary full funding should be provided. In addition to factory buildings, machinery, and equipment, joint acceptance by the industry can be adopted. Raw materials and finished products should not be frozen.</p>
<p>(3) Implement a Linked Import and Export System</p>
<p>And subsidize exports, such as adopting low-interest export loans, reducing or exempting transportation fees and tariffs, or cash subsidies. Adopt this system and stipulate that merchants use the foreign exchange earned from exporting local products to offset the need for their import foreign exchange, linking them in terms of amount or type. For example, importers of cotton yarn must export their manufactured products, cotton yarn or cloth, to offset their import foreign exchange, so that export trade depends on import trade for survival.</p>
<p>(4) Organize the Industrial Revival Investment Company</p>
<p>The company's capital is US$2 billion, with private investment accounting for one-quarter and solicitation from overseas Chinese and friendly foreigners accounting for three-quarters. It is also stipulated that our country's US$300 million in US funds can be approved to be invested as the company's capital, purchasing new machinery from overseas and investing it in domestic factories as shareholders, so that the foundation of domestic national industry will become increasingly solid.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Public Bond Trading Is Sporadic <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Public bond prices remained calm yesterday. There were only a few sporadic long-short balance transactions in the market. There was not much honor or disgrace at the opening and closing. In the middle, they first rose and then fell, and the fluctuations were also narrow. Tong Bing opened at 840 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 920 yuan, and then fell to 820 yuan, and finally hovered between 850 yuan and 870 yuan. The result was similar to last Saturday. Other bonds also lacked change.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Bull Manipulation Is Easy, Chinese Stock Changes Are Unpredictable <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks are volatile, and bull manipulation is easy. The trend of the day is to squeeze shorts. As soon as there is an upward trend, retail investors follow suit, causing dissatisfaction among large investors. Yesterday, the market used tricks again, deliberately raising the spot price. Retail investors really followed suit. The bulls took advantage of the situation to release their futures, so that the high price of Yongsah rose to 715 yuan, Meiya to 5,050 yuan, Jingfu to 307 yuan, Xinguang to 295 yuan, and Qinxing to 220 yuan. At this time, the bulls and bears struggled greatly. After 10:30 AM, the buying power began to show weakness and began to decline slightly. After 11:00 AM, the chips were overloaded again and could not be supported. Floating bulls began to cut losses. The large bull investors ignored it because there were too many unsold shares. At the low price at noon, Yongsah was 653 yuan, Meiya was 4,430 yuan, Jingfu was 270 yuan, Xinguang was 260 yuan, and Qinxing was 185 yuan. There was a slight consolidation before the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsah, Meiya, and Jingfu were still stable, while Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. Smaller and medium-sized stocks and veteran stocks were brought down, but the decline was insignificant.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially stable and then weak. Retail investors were worried about their finances and were unwilling to register with foreign companies, and many closed out their positions. The overall situation was unfavorable, and buyers were slightly hesitant. Yisha gradually moved from a high of 10,600 yuan to a low. Large and powerful players had different views and were deeply afraid that the chips would decrease, so they absorbed them from time to time when the price was low. There were many gains in the middle. At the low price, Yisha was 9,200 yuan and Yinglian was 9,600 yuan. It was slightly stable near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel stocks fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson fell slightly, and the rest fell by about 5%.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Purchasing Goods from the Gold Pound Area, Settlement Can Be Made in Gold Pounds <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank recently revised the Interim Measures for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Chinese Imports promulgated on June 24 and has ordered all designated foreign exchange banks to implement it from now on.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases from all areas of the Gold Pound Area, such as European countries, Africa, the Near East, and Southeast Asian countries, settlement can be made in British Gold Pounds or the currencies of related countries. This does not apply to exceptions approved by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(2) For purchases from the United States, Canada, the Philippines, and Latin American countries, settlement can be made in US dollars or the currencies of related countries.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Floating Capital Turns, Gold Notes Tend to Be Weak <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Gold has no attraction, and floating capital is flowing elsewhere. The market is mediocre and there is little special change. Although it struggled outside 1.97 million in the early morning, a part of those who exchanged gold for stocks gradually decreased slightly from 1.975 million. The Central Bank allocated two bars at a price of 1.96 million. After that, the low price was 1.955 million, the price was flat, and the transaction was scarce. At noon, it still hovered around 1.96 million. There was not much change in the afternoon. The trend was very stable. As a result, compared with last week, it fell back by 15,000. Ornamental gold was 200,800, patterned silver was flat, silver dollars rose slightly, and underground interest rates varied slightly from 1.1 to 1.5.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars lacked special changes. After opening at 2,560 yuan, it gradually weakened slightly. The process was mediocre. At noon, it fell back to 2,520 yuan. It was slightly stable in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 25 yuan compared with last week. Hong Kong notes were no more than about 565 yuan at the high price. The long telegram from Hong Kong was 184, which is equivalent to a Hong Kong exchange rate of only 543 yuan. As a result, the buying appetite was relatively sluggish. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 545 yuan to 555 yuan. Supply exceeded demand. The Indian exchange rate was 660 yuan to 670 yuan. The British exchange rate was 8,800 to 8,900. American exchange rates were flat both officially and unofficially.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Smoke Signals Everywhere, No Hope for Hangzhou Silk Sales to the North <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Report on July 13, Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The Life of Female Workers in Hangzhou Silk Factory (Photo by Sun Shaoxuan)</p>
<p>Zhejiang silk is famous in China. In fact, the places in Zhejiang that produce the most silk are only Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Shaoxing. The Hangzhou spun silk, Huzhou crepe, and Shaoxing spun silk that we know are all special silk materials produced in the above three places. Among the three places, Hangzhou produces the most steel, even in the mountain countries of the southwest, it is no exception, and it is loved and worn by people all over the country.</p>
<p>The largest market for Zhejiang silk is in North China and Northeast China. Beiping, North China, was the former capital, and there are many literati who love to wear comfortable and free clothing. Zhejiang silk is soft and comfortable to wear, so it is adopted. And the northern country is cold early, people love to wear silk cotton clothes, this silk cotton can only be made of Zhejiang silk as the surface, so it will not竄out of the clothes. Otherwise, each white silk cotton head will flow on the surface of the clothes, which is not very elegant.</p>
<p>Our country has always not paid much attention to numbers, so there are no reliable statistics on the exact number of Zhejiang silk sales to the north. Roughly estimated, sales to the north are often more than 30% of the total output, and the number of foreign sales is not searchable.</p>
<p>No One Cares During Eventful Times</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Hangzhou, Wuxing, and Shaoxing successively fell into the hands of the enemy, and the number of silk weavers naturally decreased sharply. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the silk industry wanted to cheer up and work hard, but for many years since the year, no one has come to ask about the price of Zhejiang silk in the Northeast and North China because of the problems of the Communist Army. Various foreign clothing materials are about to arrive in a steady stream. People who are greedy for cheapness and love fashion will certainly not want to buy Hangzhou silk anymore. Because of the sluggish sales, the level of living has risen day by day, and the cost has increased day by day, so the business has become even more bleak. Now, the silk industry is complaining every day. They miss the past prosperity, but are experiencing the current difficult situation. Although they have unlimited expectations for the future, they also feel that there is no certainty.</p>
<p>Rural Economy Suffers Hardships</p>
<p>The depression of the silk industry has also affected the silkworm farmers in the entire Hangjiahu and Zhejiang silkworm-raising counties, because good silkworms harvest good silk, which can of course be sold abroad, but the secondary silk obtained from secondary silkworms can be made into silk for self-use in their own country. Now the silk industry is sighing, many silk machines are not active, and silkworm silk has no way out, and silkworm farmers are also complaining. Therefore, the silk industry in Zhejiang is really affecting the rural economy.</p>
<p>The Livelihood of Most Women Is Precarious</p>
<p>How much has the amount of products decreased before and after the war? According to the survey of the silk weaving industry in Hangzhou City, there were more than 6,200 electric silk weaving machines and more than 8,500 hand weaving machines before the war, employing about 22,000 workers, with a monthly output of about 100,000 pieces. Now there are only more than 3,300 electric machines and only more than 2,200 hand weaving machines, with only more than 8,000 workers and a monthly output of only more than 34,000 pieces. The electric machine is less than one-half of what it was before the war, the hand weaving machine is less than one-quarter of what it was before the war, the workers are less than one-third of what they were before the war, and the output is less than one-third of what it was before the war. The median averages are two-thirds lower than before the war. Especially noteworthy is that hand-woven silk has decreased by three-quarters. These many hand-woven silks are often rural women or women who want to improve themselves. They depend on this for a living. Now that so many opportunities have been reduced, these many women will become consumers in society.</p>
<p>In other places, such as Shaoxing, electric machines have not yet recovered. It is said that Wuxing has only recovered a part, but hand weaving machines have generally decreased.</p>
<p>Two-Thirds of Workers Are Unemployed</p>
<p>We only look at the figures of the silk industry in Hangzhou City to know that the number of silk weaving workers has decreased by two-thirds. In fact, the unemployment of these two-thirds of silk weaving workers is not just the hunger and fear of more than 14,000 people, but will affect the entire family of each of them, and even affect the entire society. Is it not the same in Shaoxing and Wuxing? What will be the aftermath of this vast number of unemployed workers and this affected rural economy? Now, most people in the Hangzhou City silk industry are probably requesting loans, but whether loans are a solution is obviously a problem.</p>
<p>Improve Patterns and Weave New Silk</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to improve the patterns and make new silks to compete with foreign products. This is really the most active way, because if we borrow some money to drag on, it will become deeper and deeper. If we are determined to improve silk, then the loan will also have a future.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hold an optimistic attitude, that is, the chaotic situation in the country will always be clarified one day. When the day of clarification comes, the markets in North China and Northeast China will still have to be won back. Therefore, at this time, we may as well continue to produce in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>
<p>Again, we can have reasons to prepare for foreign sales. As long as we improve the quality and study the psychology of Americans, we will work hard to promote it and strive to manufacture it, then the foreign sales market is not without hope.</p>
<p>However, solving this major difficulty at present still requires the government and the people to jointly find another way!</p>
<h3 id="e121">Another Aspect of Suppressing Traitors in Hong Kong <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan from Hong Kong Airmail, reporting on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>In my previous dispatch, I mentioned that "traitors" are categorized based on the object of their betrayal. Due to differences in national laws, "Han traitors" betray China, while "English traitors" betray England. An English traitor is not necessarily a Han traitor. If China and England did not have this "unresolved entanglement" that is Hong Kong, with one located in the Far East and the other in Western Europe, then Han traitors and English traitors could each be managed separately, and no problems would arise. However, during World War II, Hong Kong was included in the China war zone, and the British forces that re-entered Hong Kong were ordered by our Supreme Commander, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to accept the surrender of the Japanese army. Although the Union Jack was raised again in Hong Kong after the war, this colony is now a colony with unresolved issues, and its appearance is vastly different from the past. Guangdong and Hong Kong are separated by a narrow strip of water, and many Han traitors are taking advantage of the different laws to flee to Hong Kong. The original Han traitors in Hong Kong are also using their "selling out" techniques to curry favor with the British, treating them as new lovers, feeling pleased with themselves, and acting recklessly, which has caused some storms. Among them, the most influential was the scene involving Hong Kong's top cultural traitor, Cen Weixiu. I have reported on this repeatedly in recent months, which I believe is well known to readers in China. The Hong Kong government, in order to cherish the friendship between the two great nations of China and England, has formally expressed its commitment to making great efforts to assist our country in extraditing Han traitors for trial. Previously, General Fetherstonhaugh had also reached an agreement with the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters on the method of exchanging Han traitors and war criminals. On April 16th, the Hong Kong government used a British naval vessel to transport three Han traitors captured in Hong Kong to be handed over, while Guangdong extradited six Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>Li Hanchong, the Chief of the Eradication Conspiracy Office of the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters, had negotiated an agreement with the Hong Kong government on the exchange of Han traitors and war criminals, which included three points: (1) The Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters and its liaison officer stationed in Hong Kong are the main institutions and personnel responsible for negotiating, arresting, and extraditing Han traitors; (2) All citizens of the Republic of China who committed acts that violated the Chinese Regulations for the Punishment of Han Traitors and violated the National Covenant, from July 7, 1937, to August 16, 1945, are Han traitors. The Garrison Headquarters will notify the Hong Kong authorities of their names, ages, native places, and the details of their crimes for arrest; (3) After the crimes of Han traitors in Hong Kong are confirmed, the Hong Kong authorities will arrest them, and our side will send personnel to assist. However, if the number of Han traitors to be extradited is within 20 each time, the Hong Kong authorities shall arrest them within one week and hand them over to the personnel designated by the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters for extradition and transfer to Chinese courts for trial.</p>
<p>According to reports, after the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters released the first and second lists of wanted Han traitors, there are more than 300 Han traitors of all sizes hiding in Hong Kong! In the category of cultural Han traitors alone, in addition to Cen Weixiu, who single-handedly controls the "Overseas Chinese Daily," there are twelve others. In the past six months, the Hong Kong government has tried 54 war criminals and collaborators, but has only extradited three Han traitors: Kong Weixin, the Guangzhou opium king during the enemy-puppet era, Chen Cai, a notorious enemy-puppet secret agent, and Chen Gan, the military law director of the puppet Security Command Headquarters. The Han traitors who have been explicitly wanted are still almost all acting freely in Hong Kong, beyond the reach of the law. Who should be held responsible for this oversight? How can we investigate and punish them to uplift the people's hearts? I bring this up to urge people to pay attention!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Aboard the Fleet Returning Home in the Caribbean Sea: Notes from Pearl Harbor, June 9th <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuping</p>
<p>Everyone's mood has been restless these days. The words "set sail for home" have been mentioned countless times. However, as the date of return approaches, more and more rumors of postponement are spreading. This impatient waiting is reminiscent of the feeling of waiting to fly to India in western Sichuan a year ago. When you are not abroad, you want to go abroad; when you are abroad, you want to return home. Life is often surrounded by contradictions. Finally, the order came down.</p>
<p>On April 4th, eight Chinese warships held a grand review. On the 6th, they left Guan Port to return home, visiting the overseas Chinese communities in Santiago and Havana, Cuba, along the way.</p>
<p>The voyage from Guan Port to Santiago is only a few hours. We raised our flags and weighed anchor, and by 1 p.m., we could see the lighthouse and the ancient fortress ruins in the port of Santiago. We stood on the deck, using binoculars to observe this Spanish-style ancient city. It is the second largest city in Cuba, surrounded by a sea harbor.</p>
<p>In the port, the fleet changed its unloading and docking formation, led by the flagship, the escort destroyer Tai Kang, winding its way into the port. The port was already crowded with people, and overseas Chinese organizations had hired small boats to welcome us in the harbor. The boats were marked with large characters written in brush: "Welcome the Chinese Fleet." The boats were filled with neatly dressed overseas Chinese men and women. The men raised their hands to salute us, and the women waved in the wind. Our hands also waved tirelessly in return. Our hearts were filled with excitement and joy. We have not been forgotten! These are such kind faces greeting us and cheering for us.</p>
<p>First, the flagship fired a 21-gun salute to the Cuban government. The eight ships docked in succession, followed by a return salute from the Santiago fortress, mixed with cheers, reverberating and drowning out the rhythmic waves of the Caribbean Sea. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth fluttered in the wind, flying everywhere along the city slopes, the shore, and the harbor!</p>
<p>It is customary for the navy to grant leave after docking. By just 4 p.m., the streets, refreshment shops, and clubs were filled with young Chinese naval officers in twos and threes. White uniforms and blue shoulder straps brought a touch of the East to the medieval island city. When overseas Chinese saw us, they greeted us kindly and led us intimately to visit various overseas Chinese organizations, receiving welcome and hospitality from all sides. Emotionally, we forgot that we were abroad. We gained warmth and hope, especially since we came from the sea. Just as I and several soldiers stepped from the port into the city streets, we were surrounded by a group of Cuban children. Some stretched out their hands for American cigarettes, some asked for small change, and some followed us from a distance, peeking at our good fortune. Just as we did not know how to deal with this group of children, an overseas Chinese came over to greet us and offered to accompany us to tour the area. You could often encounter this kind of warm and kind overseas Chinese on the streets.</p>
<p>But a problem arose. This overseas Chinese spoke Cantonese, while we spoke Mandarin. When we tried to speak English, he spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>He silently led us through Second Street. The difficulty was finally broken by a long silence. We realized that although Chinese dialects are diverse, the written language is unified. So we started writing to each other. In his writing, we learned that since the Chinese fleet arrived at Guan Port to receive pre-war exercises, various overseas Chinese organizations in Cuba had successively telegraphed invitations for the fleet to visit. They were also actively raising funds to welcome us, hoping to promote the country's prestige and enhance the reputation of the overseas Chinese. The Cuban government also designated April 6, the day the Chinese fleet arrived in Santiago, as "China Friendship Day."</p>
<p>In the evening, the Kuomintang branch held a flag presentation ceremony to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which Commander Lin accepted on his behalf. After the ceremony, a dance party was held to entertain the fleet officers.</p>
<p>Soldiers were touring the night market, restaurants and eateries had the footprints of Chinese sailors, and movie theaters and department stores had the footprints of Chinese sailors. Today is China Friendship Day. Tonight, Santiago is the night of the Chinese Navy.</p>
<p>By the time we returned to the ship, there was no one on the streets. The medieval national flags still fluttered quietly in the night. One or two black people followed behind us, whispering, helping night travelers find their way home. I knew that there were many black people in Santiago and that there were occasional robberies, so I looked straight ahead and walked quickly, ignoring them. After returning to the ship, I learned that a soldier's camera had been robbed by a black person. Although the city police pursued the robber, they did not catch him.</p>
<p>The next day, the 7th, was the parade in Santiago. At 9 a.m., one-third of the soldiers from each ship gathered on the seaside road, led by the Santiago city police and water police in motorcycles, and the Cuban naval band played music, slowly leading the way. Three hundred young Chinese naval officers marched in step, the long, orderly line, amidst the crowds, applause, and cheers, parading through the ancient streets of Santiago. Our steps were light, and our chests were puffed out. Like victorious warriors returning from the battlefield, we received countless respectful and admiring glances. Like sons leaving for war, we received the boundless cheers and deep blessings of our hometown.</p>
<p>After the parade, I and my Cantonese classmate Deng went to the suburbs to play, taking some photos of the scenery and monuments to commemorate the trip. Passing the city hospital, we were invited inside for a tour. The magnificent architecture and complete equipment made it hard to believe that such a hospital, which should have been located in New York or Nanjing, was found in the ancient city of Santiago, Cuba. Later, a doctor told me that Cuba is famous for producing sugar, but few people know that Cuba is also one of the most medically advanced countries. Many diseases in the United States are treated by Cuban doctors who fly over to diagnose them.</p>
<p>Everywhere we went, people stopped to look at us, and praise and admiration were constantly directed at us, young Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>Clearly, this naval visit gave the Cuban people a new concept of young China. Even the overseas Chinese who have lived on the island far from their homeland for a long time were overjoyed to meet hundreds of young people from their homeland in one day, as if they were reliving childhood dreams.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Kuomintang branch held a cocktail dance party to entertain the fleet soldiers. The branch was located in the bustling heart of the city, and the bright lights and exquisite medieval national flags decorated it like a magnificent fairy palace. The overseas Chinese in white formal wear were busy and attentive, greeting us, offering seats, serving tea, and young girls were smiling. These young Chinese who had sailed the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth from the Caribbean Sea into Santiago Harbor became honored guests.</p>
<p>Light Spanish music swirled from under the feet of the dancing couples into the quiet night sky, and curious people stood on the street, looking up.</p>
<p>Chinese people talking to Chinese people had to go through double translation. The overseas Chinese in Santiago have been in Cuba for a long time and can only speak Cantonese and Spanish. They mostly marry Cuban women. At the same time, because the environment does not require it, their children cannot even speak Cantonese. Therefore, at this dance party, to talk to these overseas Chinese girls, you first had to have an overseas Chinese translate the Spanish into Cantonese, and then have a Cantonese speaker translate the Cantonese into Mandarin.</p>
<p>There were no words, but the steps were consistent, heart leaning on heart, silently waltzing in this seaside city night, from the busiest time in the city until there was not a single figure on the street. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese fleet blew its whistles and weighed anchor. On the dock were still the same people, waving flags and waving their hands, but the emotions were different from before. It is easy to meet but difficult to part. Coming quickly and going quickly!</p>

<h3 id="e123">Visiting a Brave General in Panshi, Changchun Airmail, 15th <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>Heishi Town is about 90 li from Huadian City. On the afternoon of July 3rd, we saw it. Like Hengdaohezi, Heishi Town is also a small plain surrounded by mountains, belonging to Panshi County. The town itself does not have many residents, but it is still a center for the surrounding dozens of li and an important hub between Panshi and Huadian. Hearing that General Long was coming, the elders from villages as far as dozens of li away came. When they met General Long, they made many requests; the most urgent was to send troops to protect their villages or to issue firearms to deal with scattered bandits. Because of the harassment of scattered bandits, many villagers have painfully left their manors and moved to places where they have no roots. General Long agreed to try to find a way or forward their requests to the provincial government, but he asked the local authorities to repair the roads well, especially those that could be used by vehicles, so that the national army could transport supplies flexibly and quickly rush to their aid.</p>
<p>On July 4th, we arrived in Panshi. Seeing the bunkers standing on the mountain peaks around Panshi and at important road intersections, the name "Panshi" became even more fitting. General Long's troops stationed in Panshi have participated in battles to recover the south bank of the Hun River, Liaoyang, Sujiatun, Benxi, Kaiyuan, Xifeng, and Yitong after leaving the customs. They were also the first to enter Yongji. I met Regiment Commander Yang Maofa, who led a battalion into Yongji along the Jichang Highway. Regiment Commander Yang is from Xinyi, Guangdong, looks to be only thirty years old, is not tall, but has big eyes and a red face. He vividly told me about the process of occupying Yongji. He said that in the days before entering Yongji, the advance was very rapid, marching more than 100 li every day. At 3:00 p.m. on May 28th, they entered the city through the north gate. After a short battle, the Eighth Route Army was defeated and fled south. Amid the cheers and comfort of the people of Yongji, Regiment Commander Yang quickly deployed the city's defenses. About two or three hours later, the 88th Division and the 41st Division also entered the city from the east and west gates, respectively, further consolidating the defenses of Yongji.</p>
<p>The entire county of Panshi has a population of 260,000, and the urban area has more than 20,000. After the Eighth Route Army withdrew, the local authorities' main tasks were to comfort and rescue refugees, stabilize the local area, and repair roads. County Magistrate Hu Riyong, originally an instructor in the Youth Army, is loyal and approachable. Thanks to his tireless work, county administration has gradually gotten back on track.</p>
<p>At noon on the 5th, we took the Yantongshan Road from Panshi back to Yongji. Along the way, at every checkpoint, General Long was warmly welcomed and sincerely saluted by the people. Especially in Yantongshan, a small town, the people's enthusiastic rush was truly moving. In the long welcoming line, there were also students and teachers from the Korean Overseas School standing out. Wearing white uniforms with a touch of yellow, they waved flags and shouted. The president of the Korean Overseas Association here speaks fluent Chinese and had a cordial conversation with General Long for 20 minutes. He said that among the hundreds of Korean Overseas in Yantongshan, more than 200 had joined the Eighth Route Army. Those who remained also lived in poverty and hoped to return to Korea in the short term. General Long agreed to forward their requests, but before they returned to their country, he hoped that they would strengthen their organization and not disturb local law and order. If they were law-abiding, our soldiers and civilians would inevitably treat them with a friendly attitude.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Nurturing the Seedlings of Industry <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The root cause of the various problems in our country today can be attributed to stagnant production. If we continue to treat the symptoms rather than the cause, there will inevitably be a day when the disease becomes incurable! The fundamental solution lies in increasing production, especially industry. However, there is a major prerequisite - namely, the peace and stability of the political situation, because war is what causes production to stagnate the most. Therefore, we demand an immediate end to the war. All parties must recognize the direction of the world economy and implement a democratic agricultural and industrial policy based on the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father.</p>
<p>(1) Foundation: The Founding Father's proclamation of "restricting capital and equalizing land ownership," as well as his industrial plan, and the industrial construction program and agricultural land policy of the recent Sixth National Congress, are all guiding plans and programs for construction. The capital we need should be national industrial capital. The current various distorted capital will be expelled from the capital market. Our industrialization should be built on the foundation of agriculture. We should preserve our country's inherent heritage - agriculture; the fruits of industrialization should also only be enjoyed by the vast number of farmers, because they are the source of market purchasing power. But to increase purchasing power, we must solve the land problem, which is urgently needed in both the short and long term.</p>
<p>(2) Production Costs: The shortage of raw materials can also be said to be the failure to develop raw materials as much as possible, which is a major problem, and this is related to technical talent. Other issues include the abundance of water and thermal power equipment and supply, the improvement of production means such as machinery and tool equipment, the cultivation and rational allocation of labor, and the rectification of wages and labor disputes to ensure labor-management coordination. As for the issue of expenditure, it depends on the solution of the price problem. Production costs are closely related to production technology and production means. It is enough to look at the different production situations before and after the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe to know this. Now that the discovery of appropriate atomic energy may bring about an epoch-making change in industry.</p>
<p>(3) Talent and Management: The government should cultivate talent and promote true talent; if it continues the past practice of setting up positions based on people, it will be a major obstacle to the future of industrialization. The recent death of engineer Hao, who studied in France, is an example. At the same time, we must not be afraid to admit our shortcomings. For example, the return of a batch of exported goods due to non-compliance with standards is due to backward technology. Therefore, we should cultivate domestic talent on the one hand and utilize foreign technical talent on the other. For example, the large-scale hydropower project in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, as long as the power is in our hands, even if we set a fixed method, it will not harm the overall situation. With a spirit of hard work, use scientific management methods in a planned way to adjust and allocate normal human resources, so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest and be rewarded according to their work.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Exchange: The level of the exchange rate is of great importance to domestic industrialists and business people. China has always been an importing country, so it should use tariff policies to strictly manage and control foreign exchange, and restrict the import of some non-essential goods. In this way, imported goods will not be dumped, and the development of the national industry in its nascent stage will not be affected. As for the export business, the state can use various methods to subsidize and support it, so that the investment and expansion of the national industry can be fearless. International trade should first seek self-sufficiency and then seek the promotion of overseas markets. If cotton textiles are exported on the one hand and inferior cotton fabrics are imported on the other hand, it is an unequal exchange, which is a distorted international trade.</p>
<p>(5) Transportation and Taxes: The transportation network of a country is like the blood vessels of a human body, and its importance is well known. To develop industry, we must develop transportation as much as possible to make production and sales transportation flexible. However, today China's transportation system is blocked and inconvenient. For example, there is a cotton shortage in Shanghai, while there is a phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground in the Shaanxi and Gansu production areas. As for taxes, direct collection methods should be used as much as possible, and the burden should not be shifted. We should also strive for fairness and conservation. The taxation of foreign goods should not be overly preferential.</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the major points. Other important points include the link with finance, the need for stable currency values, the abolition of usury, the rational allocation of production means, and the promotion of cooperative business methods. In short, saving the industrial crisis is not only a matter of industry itself, but all related departments must pay attention to it at the same time. Therefore, the future of China's industrialization is bright, and the key lies in whether the planners and implementers can implement it practically, so that the seedlings of China's fragile industry can develop and grow rapidly.

<h3 id="e127">Do Not Forget the Righteous People Who Miss Their Homes <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In the post-victory repatriation, many officials went down to the east without any difficulty. Secondly, those with a little means also found ways to receive public funds and had already returned to their homes, which they had left for eight years. Only we, a group of refugees from Jiangnan, numbering more than 200,000 (who are also righteous people), are still wandering in Guizhou and the Southwest, eating up all we have and living in poverty! The reason is that we ourselves have no way to raise a considerable amount of repatriation funds. At the same time, we are, after all, refugees, so how can we have the nerve to blame the government for forgetting us?</p>
<p>Some time ago, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Highway Administration held a program to send refugees back to their hometowns. The method was that the Administration and the Highway Administration subsidized half of the expenses for ordinary refugees, and the Administration and the Highway Administration bore the expenses for the extremely poor, including food expenses. But before long, this method was announced to be discontinued in late May. This is tantamount to a deadly blow to us, because we were expecting repatriation, so we sold all our belongings. Now we are simply in a desperate situation!</p>
<p>It is said that the reason for the suspension of repatriation is that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration failed to allocate the required subsidies in full, and the Highway Administration was naturally unable to continue to advance the funds, so this work was put aside like a tiger's head and a snake's tail. But our livelihood is difficult, and we are worried all day long. Are the government and society really going to ignore us? Zhang Chaogui (mason), Liu Kechang (barber), Shi Juru (peddler), Wang Fayaou (printing worker), and Pan Shichang (news vendor), all Soviet refugees in Guiyang.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>The other day, I heard from our old classmate that a former classmate of ours, Ms. Qiu, who was an excellent student in both character and academics, has fallen into a place where souls are sold, to be played with and ravaged! What unfortunate news! A female elementary school graduate, due to family economic problems, became a... guide, selling her life's happiness. I sigh with regret for her!</p>
<p>I think in this society, I really don't know how many young girls are wandering and falling because of the flames of war. They were excellent students in school, and now! Their footprints are in hotels, dance halls, and bars. The ladies who smile at people and cry behind their backs, their pain is more unbearable than being cut by a knife!</p>
<p>Therefore, I shout loudly, hoping that society will set up more factories, as long as they can make a living, they will never willingly do this flesh trade! (Respectfully, Chen Xingqiao)</p>

<h3 id="e129">Chao County Growing Amidst Thorns <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Fourteenth Chao County Correspondence, Bai Baiping</p>
<p>Speaking of Chao County, readers may not be too unfamiliar with it. It is the hometown of Generals Feng Yuxiang and Zhang Zhizhong, bordering the eastern shore of Chao Lake, and is a not-too-small county in central Anhui. Since May of the 27th year, it has spent seven years and three months of suffering under the clutches of Japanese devils. It was only on August 17th of last year that it returned to the embrace of the motherland. After more than seven years of torment, countless disasters, hardships, and bitterness, even after eleven months of management and revival, it is still full of broken tiles and rubble after extreme destruction and devastation. If you are a native of the county returning from wandering, as soon as you enter the county seat, you will have the feeling of reading "Rhapsody on the Abandoned Capital."</p>
<p>Enemy-Puppet Crimes Now Lead to Housing Shortage</p>
<p>Today's Chao County, whether in the city or in the countryside, also faces a housing shortage, although not as severe as in Beijing and Shanghai. The reason for the housing shortage is neither "sealing" nor "confiscation." In all the towns and villages that the Japanese devils passed through, the better houses were burned or demolished. The situation in the city is even worse. Now, the refugees are returning one after another, and the population is increasing day by day. The original housing for the people during the occupation already feels cramped, and there has only been destruction without construction. Nowadays, everyone is struggling under the high pressure of prices. The whip of life has beaten people to the point where they can't breathe. Where can they talk about building houses? Thus, a housing shortage has formed.</p>
<p>Urban construction is relatively easy to restore, but it is difficult here. Private sole investment in construction is out of the question. Even for public utilities, for example, the original site of the county middle school was burned down by the Japanese devils. After the victory, local people organized the "Chao County Middle School Building Committee," mobilized the people of the whole county to donate, and misappropriated a lot of local public funds, but now construction has been suspended halfway due to lack of money. The county government and its affiliated agencies are still renting private houses. From this, it can be seen that both the public and private sectors are in trouble!</p>
<p>Bearing Heavy Burdens, the Good People Suffer</p>
<p>The pain that the housing shortage gives to the people is not the sharpest. The disaster victims after the looting seem to have sores all over their bodies. When a large sore hurts too much, they forget the pain of the small sores. For more than seven years, the common people have been squeezed dry by the enemy, puppets, and bandits, and now only a few dry bones are left. They need rich nutrition and sufficient rest to have hope of restoring their original health. But what is the reality? The marrow in the dry bones is still being squeezed out, squeezed to the point of only a faint groan!</p>
<p>The reporter is not yet clear about Chao County's local finances, but will only talk about the burden on the people. Last year, the central government exempted the recovered areas from land tax for one year, which was a blessing from the country, and Chao County did benefit from it. However, the disguised taxes are much heavier than the land tax. The 70,000 piculs of military grain that Chao County was required to pay have already been paid in full, but the officially set grain price is far lower than the market price. Even with this cheap grain money, the common people did not receive the full amount at the official price. Where was the discount taken from? Only the common people's hearts are clear. Although the land tax was exempted last year, there was a item called "county-level public grain," with a levy of 30 to 50 piculs per "jia." This was only once, and the common people could still bear it. However, every month, rice, grass, and money are required because the county has a total of twenty-eight townships, each with a township office and a central primary school, and each "bao" has a "bao" office and a "bao" national primary school. The salaries of the staff and teachers of these institutions and schools, and all office expenses, are directly borne by the local people. In addition, there are temporary expenses for township and "bao" chiefs and "jia" heads, which also have to be raised and compensated. And that's not the end of it. The monthly salary of the "bao" police team soldiers is three "shi" three "sheng" of coarse rice and 3,000 yuan, which includes food and salary. Therefore, when the "bao" police team is stationed in a certain township, they always have to ask for extra things from the local area to supplement their food. This is not a question of the military discipline of the "bao" police team; the meager salary forces them to do so. Furthermore, each "xiangding" in the township office receives five "shi" of rice and 5,000 yuan per month. In today's constantly rising prices, it is barely enough to support themselves, let alone take care of their families?</p>
<p>To this day, rice prices in this county seat and countryside have risen as much as in Beijing and Shanghai. The reason is that the common people have no rice. Nine out of ten families have no food. The rice is still like green grass in the fields. It does not mature in a day because of the owner's expectations. The common people wander in the fields every day, stroking the only lifeline. However, it will only be harvested in two months. In these two months, they still have to produce rice, grass, and money!</p>
<p>Favorable Weather, When Will There Be National Peace and Prosperity?</p>
<p>The common people, under the shadow of sorrow and suffering, hope for a good harvest this year. The money borrowed, the rice borrowed, the addition of agricultural implements, and even marrying daughters and taking wives are all prepared to be repaid and purchased after the autumn harvest. Naturally, marriage expenses also come from this. Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life. This year, the crops are indeed very good. Since the rice transplanting until now, the weather has been favorable, without worrying about floods or droughts. Moreover, everyone says that this year's rice seedlings are better than last year, so the harvest will naturally be more than last year. This is a great joy in the hearts of the common people.</p>
<p>Although the common people are bearing heavy burdens now, they have hope for the autumn harvest. They have forgotten their own pain and are focusing on national affairs. In the past two months, the northern township of this county has become a stronghold for the Communist army. They appear and disappear mysteriously, gathering and dispersing unpredictably, sometimes splitting into small groups, sometimes merging into large groups. Therefore, how many people they actually have is still a mystery. It is said that this is the "people's army," and they directly ask the common people for rice and money. The families with some food and clothing in the northern township have been emptied, and sometimes they even kill people to show off their power. The local armed forces are weak and can only defend and block, but cannot advance and pursue, causing the people of the whole county to be uneasy.</p>
<p>After nine years of hardship for the country, the common people are no longer indifferent to national affairs. Today, what they hope for is peace, stability, and national unity. They don't care about bearing heavy burdens and suffering themselves, as long as they can live in peace, they will be satisfied. They used to live under the clutches of the enemy and puppets. Although the flowers bloomed and withered every year, they let the Lunar New Year, which they valued the most, pass quietly every year, without even pasting a couplet. It was not until last year's victory that they celebrated the Lunar New Year grandly, with "firecrackers in every house and peach wood charms on every door." Unexpectedly, the country was "...unfavorable." After defeating the brutal enemy, "civil war" broke out again. An old man pointed to the spring couplet "Favorable weather, national peace and prosperity" on his door and said to the writer: "This year is originally favorable weather, but when will national peace and prosperity be realized?"</p>
<h3 id="e130">Education and Culture Progressing in Hard Work <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The common people are still living in a storm, so it is difficult to make progress in everything. The rural areas are desolate, and how can the abnormal prosperity of the cities support the important task of the country? Today, every city also presents a phenomenon of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. All undertakings are full of difficulties. The writer is relatively close to the education and culture sectors here, so let's talk about these two.</p>
<p>Chao County currently has one county middle school, one demonstration primary school, one Huanglu Normal School founded by Zhang Zhizhong, and central primary schools and "bao" primary schools in each township and "bao." The common ailment of each level of school is poverty, especially the central primary schools and "bao" primary schools. Because the rice and money are directly collected from the "bao" and "jia," and the common people themselves are crying out for food, they naturally cannot take out rice and money every month. It is common for teachers in the central and "bao" primary schools to have no rice to cook. How can we run the country's basic education well in this way? It's not a child's play! As for the teachers' salaries in the central primary schools, it is six "shi" of rice and 10,000 yuan per month. Even if it is paid monthly, it is difficult to avoid spending next month's income this month, let alone delay payment? The reporter here sincerely appeals to the government to please save the teachers soon.</p>
<p>Speaking of culture, it is very pitiful. You can't find a decent bookstore in the whole city. There are two newspapers, one is the Chao County Daily, jointly run by the party and government, and the other is the Chao Sheng Bao, organized by the Youth League. Both are quarto-sized lithographs, printed on one side only, divided into two pages. The first page publishes domestic and foreign news, clipped from newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, always two or three days old. Two-thirds of the second page is local news, and one-third is a supplement. Each page occasionally has some advertisements. Both of these are maintaining publication in hardship. The spirit of hard work of the staff is worthy of admiration. It is said that Mr. Tong Chunxuan, a provincial senator, Mr. Gao Qiwo, the principal of the county middle school, and local people who are enthusiastic about cultural undertakings, are planning to organize a printing house in the autumn and change lithography to letterpress printing. We wish them smooth success. This is necessary for the promotion of culture.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, today's Chao County is where the common people are in pain, the leaders of all sectors are working hard, and all undertakings are in the process of revival. The reporter hopes that when there is an opportunity to report on the situation here for the second time, this worn-out pen can write a joyful newsletter.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Summer on the Shores of West Lake <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, July 2nd</p>
<p>"If you compare West Lake to Xizi, it is beautiful whether heavily or lightly adorned." This is a line of poetry praising the beauty of West Lake. We people who live in Hangzhou always like to stroll along the lake when we have nothing to do. Indeed, sunlight, moonlight, and starlight set off and reflect various different beauties of West Lake. Spring has passed, and West Lake has changed into its summer attire. The tender green branches along the embankment have been painted with a darker color. The lotus leaves in the inner lake are luxuriant, and the lotus flowers are budding. When the boat passes by, the hull rubs against the lotus branches, making a "sha sha" sound, as if it has many things to tell you. A burst of lotus fragrance makes the travelers feel relaxed and happy. At night, when there is no moon, many people take small boats, bringing musical instruments, accompanied by young women, and sing in the lake. So when you are strolling along the lake, there are many boats that entice you to take their boat by calling out "Let's go listen to a little tune."</p>
<p>West Lake is a Never-Ending Source of Enjoyment</p>
<p>West Lake is beautiful enough. Many people in Hangzhou told me: "We have lived in Hangzhou for thirty or forty years, but we never get tired of playing in West Lake." Because Hangzhou has West Lake, it has a large income every year. I heard some people say, "Because West Lake can support Hangzhou, the city government is making every effort to clean up West Lake." This sentence seems to be good on the surface, but after thinking about it, one cannot help but criticize the municipal authorities. In fact, it is no wonder that people criticize them. On the busiest road, Baoyoufang, the sewage overflows on both sides. The shops are trying their best to dress up and decorate, broadcasting music, and calling on customers, but looking at the stinky water lying in front of them is really a powerful satire. The other roads, such as Qingtai Road, are no exception. We are even more worried that the asphalt road surface on these roads will soon be damaged. And the small alleys and back streets, "ju" is the appropriate word. It is also an inevitable fact that you have to grope your way home in the dark.</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that the city's lake channels are being dredged. The Huansha Creek, which is suitable for "drinking, washing, and urinating," is still busy with "drinking, washing, and urinating." Because the stinky water in Hangzhou flows everywhere, there are particularly many mosquitoes and flies. These mosquitoes and flies are not small in courage. You drive them away with a fan, but when you stop fanning, they come again. Especially the mosquitoes are particularly persistent, making you suffer unbearably.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Citizens Happily Drink "Rainwater," Rainwater being the water that flows down from the tin "gutters" installed on the roof. Whenever it rains, the rain flows from the tiled roof into the "gutters" and then from the "gutters" into the water tank. They don't ask whether there is dirt on the tiled roof or whether there is cat urine or bird droppings. They all consider drinking "rainwater" to be the best beverage.</p>
<p>Many hotels and food shops rarely have gauze covers to cover the cooked food, mostly letting dust and flies patronize.</p>
<p>Working Shirtless</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, except for a few luxurious buildings on the shores of West Lake that have sanitary facilities such as flushing toilets, the rest all use "chamber pots." The people who empty the chamber pots don't necessarily come early in the morning like in Shanghai. Some even come to empty them near lunch time. Therefore, feces and meals meet at the same time. It is even more unimaginable for people who eat, use the toilet, and live together, but they are used to it, and they are not surprised by it.</p>
<p>Many citizens of Hangzhou are also poor. They still have to seek their work. So, in a situation of working and sweating, the "shirtless" thing is very common. Although you can't see it on a few grand roads, it's also commonplace in back streets and alleys.</p>
<p>After the Dance Halls Were Banned</p>
<p>The dance halls on the shores of West Lake have been banned, replaced by female storytellers, as well as female singers and female storytellers, but they are not as prosperous as the dance halls. Recently, many female storytellers also accompany guests to play. Although the municipal government has posted "No sitting with guests" in the storytelling venues, it cannot prohibit it outside the storytelling venues, right? Besides, who can tell in the painting venue whether this is a storyteller or not? The China Restaurant has opened a rooftop garden on the roof of Hangzhou's tallest building, the Xihua Building, with some thatched sheds covered with reed mats, writing tempting words such as "Elevator up and down." In fact, this is the first time Hangzhou has had an elevator, but it is an underestimation of the old fellows of Hangzhou to call out "Elevator up and down."</p>
<p>The Kingdom Dance Hall has now changed to performing dance skills, the West Garden has changed to storytelling, and the West Lake has changed to singing. For some reason, some low-taste comedians from Shanghai are making a big splash here. Each entertainment venue uses prominent titles such as "Special invitation to the comedic master ×××" to attract customers.</p>
<p>Yingzi Road to the Lakeside</p>
<p>In the evening, from Yingzi Road to the lakeside, you can hear the sound of "ding ding da" everywhere. These are some people selling iced water. They set up small stalls, using many glass cups, with cold water in the cups, putting some red and yellow colors in the water, and then putting some sugar. There is also a piece of ice, using their specially made tool to shave some down and put it in the water in the cup, selling it for fifty yuan a cup. The sound of "ding ding da" is the sound of... collision when shaking the implement. This cheap cold drink is indeed doing brisk business.</p>
<p>Summer in Hangzhou is probably no more than the above, but until now, no one has been found to have cholera. Someone asked: "What's the reason for this?" Someone answered: "This is a Buddhist country. The Bodhisattva is spiritual, so it doesn't bring disaster to the old folks of Hangzhou!"</p>

In the 30th year, I leased the land use right to the Wang family to build a house and leased the second courtyard to the Wang family to open a business. The contract stated that the term was eight years, and the house would be taken back when the term expired. The Wang family was required to take back the house built by the Wang family at the market price and the Wang family handed over the building list to me for safekeeping. In the 32nd year, the second courtyard and the land were leased to the Wang family along with the land for the establishment of land use rights. There are still two years before the expiration of the term for the complete recovery of property rights. I have suffered too much loss. Please answer: (1) Can the price of the pawn be increased to the Wang family? (2) Can the land use right be cancelled? (3) When all property rights are recovered in the future, how will the pawn price be calculated, in puppet currency or legal currency?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) No. (2) If there is no evidence of coercion or fraud, it cannot be cancelled. (3) Of course, it is calculated according to legal currency, and in reference to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Restoration, the court should fairly determine the increase or decrease in payment.</p>
<p>(2) Jiang Quan asks: I rented a small workshop in Wuxi. The landlord, Zhang, is a local bully. During the enemy and puppet period, he used his evil power to drive out other tenants. The lease contract is signed every six months or three months. The rent is particularly high. The land in Wuxi is severely short of housing. (1) If he refuses to accept the rent, is it considered a long-term rental in law? Is it valid to deposit the money in the local bank and notify him by letter to collect it? (2) Leaving aside the common legal currency, is it reasonable to use the price of rice as the standard? Is it a crime to despise the national currency? (3) If I suffer infringement due to the rent relationship, can I file a lawsuit and demand compensation? (4) The Shanghai Housing Management Committee announced that the rent for residential houses is calculated at 140 times that of the 26th year. Is it valid in Wuxi? (5) If I ignore his unreasonable demands or refuse to accept them, is it illegal? (6) If he claims that the house has been sold to others, what should I do?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) The notice of rent collection and deposit shall not be regarded as rent arrears. (2) It depends on whether there is such a custom in Wuxi. (3) The request for compensation must be based on actual damage. (4) It depends on whether the local administrative authorities have such regulations. (5) Since the lease has expired, whether to renew the lease must be resolved first. (6) If the lease is renewed, the lease right will not be affected by the transfer of ownership of the leased property.</p>
<p>(3) Li Shengyang asks: I had a house that was pawned before the incident. When it expired, we had not yet won the victory. When I asked to redeem it, the other party insisted that the money was silver coins and that the price of rice should be used to calculate the redemption. I did not have the economic strength. After mediation, I still followed the other party's proposal and signed another contract. Because I was confused by the saying that it would be considered absolute if it was overdue, I avoided signing. I don't know whether the contract signed under pressure before the victory can be revoked and resolved according to law. Please give instructions.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yabai answers] You can only request revocation if there are facts and evidence of coercion or fraud.</p>
<p>Letter from the Direct Taxation Bureau</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Recently, I read an article titled "Economic Loopholes" by reader Cui Zi'an in your newspaper, who had some misunderstandings about stamp tax tickets. The answer is as follows: (1) The highest denomination of the stamp tax currently sold is 1,000 yuan. Many merchants buy them, which may be unknown to the submitter. (2) Merchants who use more than 10,000 yuan of stamp tax tickets at one time can come to the bureau to apply for the issuance of a three-part payment form. After paying the tax to the national treasury with the payment form, the receipt can be used instead of stamp tax tickets. In fact, many merchants come to the bureau to apply for the issuance of a three-part payment form. The above two points are respectfully disclosed to dispel doubts. Sincerely, Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, July 18.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Bureau Prohibits Extortion</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: It is the duty of our bureau to send telegrams, and there is no regulation on receiving any fees. However, it has recently been found that a small number of unscrupulous elements are extorting petty fees from merchants in the name of the bureau, which is very hateful. In addition to repeatedly publishing prohibitions in your newspaper, we hereby send a letter requesting your newspaper to publish this letter and inform the merchants not to give any fees in the future, so as to stop bad habits and achieve cooperative results. We are deeply grateful and wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>The Elderly Donate Books to Help the Disaster Relief</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: I feel sorry for the victims and cannot help them. With the aim of doing what I can, I am willing to donate one hundred pages of books and fan paintings. Please collect the items and money on behalf of your office. All four styles of calligraphy, including cursive, regular script, seal script, and official script, are acceptable. Each item is worth 10,000 yuan. If there are those who have a preference, they can also inscribe their names, limited to one hundred pages.

<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>In this world, there are many exceedingly lovable reds, and also many exceedingly terrifying reds. Lovable reds are like spring roses and red roses, and the red leaves and red beans of poets. Terrifying reds are like the seas of blood and rivers of blood on battlefields, and the raging flames of atomic bombs. Everyone knows this. But now I want to tell you a story about red, which is not about any of these. Please listen quietly.</p>
<p>There was a lively young woman who acted in plays. She said, "I'm too fat!"</p>
<p>So she tried to reduce her food intake as much as possible, eating only a little porridge, a little fruit, and a little unsweetened coffee.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she was satisfied. Looking in the mirror, her waist was as slender as a willow, and her legs were as beautiful as a painting. But then she discovered a flaw and said, "My voice is too hoarse!"</p>
<p>This seemed a bit difficult, but after consulting others, it wasn't hard. She ate two raw eggs every morning and shouted a few times at the sea. In addition, the person who gave her advice whispered in her ear, "As long as your face is outstanding, it doesn't matter if your voice is a little off!"</p>
<p>The young woman smiled knowingly, and then everything was ready.</p>
<p>The first night, the curtain rose, and the audience below was silent. -- The young woman was very anxious and desperately batted her eyelashes.</p>
<p>The second night, the curtain rose, and there was a slight "Bravo" from below. -- The young woman received a trace of comfort and desperately batted her eyelashes again.</p>
<p>The third night, the curtain rose, and there was a burst of applause from below. -- The young woman smiled slightly, all the while desperately batting her eyelashes.</p>
<p>Finally, one night, the curtain rose, and there was a thunderous roar from below! -- The young woman's heart bloomed with joy, knowing that she was red!</p>
<p>Red! Everything has changed!</p>
<p>The young woman sneezes, and a new poem appears in a tabloid. The young woman coughs, and a brilliant article appears in a tabloid. The young woman sheds a tear, and it's a terrible, terrible thing! ...</p>
<p>At three o'clock, General Manager Zhang's car stops at the door; at four o'clock, Director Li calls; at five o'clock, college student Xiao Wang appears at the back door with flowers; at six o'clock, veteran news reporter Lao Chen whistles in the alley. ...</p>
<p>The pictorial publishes photos of the young woman in every issue. The young woman has to bury herself in research, figuring out how to make the photos "beautiful eyes looking forward, a charming smile." ...</p>
<p>Large companies and hotels constantly invite the young woman to unveil monuments and cut ribbons. The young woman has to rack her brains day and night to design new outfits, figuring out how to dress in a way that surpasses the crowd, as beautiful as a celestial being. ...</p>
<p>Too much! Too much! In short, the young woman is red, but thousands of gazes bind her hands and feet, thousands of mouths wait on her every action, thousands of ears manage her pronunciation, and thousands of worries weigh on her heart. She can no longer get peace and freedom!</p>
<p>The story is finished. You must be saying that it's a shallow and meaningless story, with nothing to say. But the more shallow and meaningless things are in the world, the more perplexing they sometimes are. For example, the young woman in this story. You're surely going to laugh at her for being foolish and bringing trouble on herself. But wait! Please take a mirror and look at yourself: Hey! Aren't you also desperately "batting your eyelashes" at people, desperately trying to "become red"?</p>
<h3 id="e134">Lamp <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Feng</p>
<p>This is truly a night of wind and rain. Raindrops constantly beat on the roof, and the cold wind hissed in through the gaps in the window, giving me a feeling of gloom and terror.</p>
<p>On the desk, a dim oil lamp flickers. A smoky tail of flame constantly swayed in the cold wind. The faint lamplight made this small room even more gloomy and terrifying. When the mice scurried under my feet, I almost doubted that this was the human world. It seemed that this small room was secretly transforming, shrinking in the dim light, as if it was going to be buried with me in this world of wind and rain. When I fearfully pulled open the door, a gust of furious cold wind, carrying scattered rain, struck my face. In the daytime, the mountain peak that stood majestically on the opposite bank of the river, the green trees, and the houses facing the river had disappeared into the dark atmosphere. The entire world was swallowed by darkness. The river, the mountains, and the sky merged into a pitch-black color.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the distant riverbank, a bright light flickered, like a firefly swaying in the wind and rain. It floated across the riverbank, floated across the mountain path, and slowly disappeared into the dark shadows of the mountains. I knew that was a traveler's lamp in the dark night. In this bleak, wind-swept, and rainy night, the human world is so cruel. The wind and rain are like the relentless raging waves of life, constantly assaulting him. And the road of life is so uneven, mixed with muddy rainwater, that he may slip at any time, causing him to fall with painful wounds. However, this little light of a road lamp, like a mother's loving heart, a friend's warm hand, gave him infinite comfort, gave him infinite warmth, so that he could step by step walk towards that warm and bright place on this dangerous road.</p>
<p>The flickering lamplight has disappeared, and the world has returned to blackness. I wonder how many people are still groping on the windy and rainy roads in this dark world! Because they have all lost the bright road lamp. In the dark night of wind and rain, they cannot get any help and can only let the violent wind and rain swallow them.</p>
<p>The darkness seemed to be expanding, the wind and rain became even more violent, and a cold, gloomy atmosphere constantly permeated around me, as if I was about to be swept into this terrible world.</p>
<p>When I fearfully closed the door again and returned to the front of the desk, that dim oil lamp had become endearing. I trimmed the wick a bit, letting it emit a bright light.</p>
<p>In this dark world, only it can give me light and warmth!</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The fate of China, like Li Hua's fate, after countless calamities, is gradually seeing a new outlook! When the power of the Northern Warlords continued to inflict suffering on the people, revolutionary soldiers raised the banner of "Down with the Warlords" and began the Northern Expedition! China was praying for the realization of a new ideal, and Li Hua was also praying for the realization of a new ideal!</p>
<p>Li Hua respected both Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling as teachers, but she also had another indescribable emotion for Dong Shaoling. This emotion may be the emotion that Mrs. Mo was worried about. But Li Hua was not aware of it herself. She only felt that Dong Shaoling had a power that could control her. It seemed that if Li Hua did not see him for more than three days, she felt like she had a heavy burden weighing on her! And it seemed that if Dong Shaoling did not listen to Li Hua's performance for more than three days, Li Hua, from the stage, not seeing Dong Shaoling, who always sat in the right-side box below the stage, would immediately become bewildered and flustered! She herself was very strange, as she had never had this experience before. And when she was with Dong Shaoling, she was still taciturn. However, she was always smiling, and her smile seemed to be whispering; it was an indescribable infinite emotion!</p>
<p>Dong Shaoling, a neurotic intellectual full of emotion. But his emotions were expressed in many ways. In other words, his loves and hates were multifaceted, just as his talent was multifaceted. It seemed that he loved mountains and water; he loved flowers and grass; he loved painting and music; he loved new literature and old poetry; he loved cats and dogs and birds; he loved women and men. He hated thieves and eunuchs; he hated prostitutes and clients; he hated poverty and wealth; he hated foolishness and cunning. Because of this, his emotions could not be focused on a single "love" or "hate"! He could die for you, and he could die for him; but this was impossible, so he often suffered from not having enough emotion to distribute! And dissatisfaction! He had never stood on his own ground to think about something for himself or do something for himself, so he could also be called: a romantic intellectual of ego-less-ness. He loved Feng Hua very much, and it could be said that he liked her very much; he sympathized with her very much and was very willing to help her. But his "love" was like loving a child; a junior; his "like" was like liking a flower; a play; his "sympathy" was like sympathizing with a pair of innocent geese being hunted; like sympathizing with people who were generally abused and hurt; his willingness to "help" was like wanting to help all the weak under oppression. Therefore, the feelings he gave to Li Hua were nothing special, like the feelings he gave to everyone.</p>

<p>— Xie Beicheng</p>
<p>There was a time when I lived in Tianjin and tasted the flavor of floods for the first time. I remember that at that time, it wasn't long after the "July 7th Incident," but Tianjin had already fallen. Everyone's heart was wrapped in a layer of anxiety, waiting every day for the mimeographed newspaper to be delivered through the crack in the door (those of us who have experienced life in occupied areas naturally understand that we were forced to be mutes and forced to be deaf). The enthusiasm of those underground workers was worth thanking. Gradually, I got to know them, but this was also a very short thing. Finally, I heard that their pitiful mimeograph newspaper office had been "uncovered," and all the staff had been arrested. Some disappeared like that, and some, many days later, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, came to shake my hand and say goodbye. My mood was even more anxious than others.</p>
<p>One evening, sitting on a "rickshaw," I sent these "news workers" to the Zizhu Lin Wharf. I heard children singing loudly in a missionary school in the concession:</p>
<p>"Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!</p>
<p>Let our flesh and blood build our new Great Wall…"</p>
<p>I hadn't heard this familiar song for a long time. With tears of excitement in my eyes, I held my friends' hands:</p>
<p>"Bless you…"</p>
<p>My friends whispered back to me:</p>
<p>"Everyone is walking the road they should walk, and only children should be blessed!"</p>
<p>I remembered their words and silently walked home. In the twilight, I could still hear the children singing: "We must recover our lost territory, overthrow Japanese imperialism, and kill all the robbers of the old world!"</p>
<p>In this kind of anxiety, we heard other news every day: "The Qiangzi River is rising." Then it rained every day. The Qiangzi River's water got higher day by day. The flood was coming. One's own life was important, and the anxiety and shame of losing the motherland gradually faded. Instead, every household built walls, blocked doorways, and built dikes. Finally, one night, there was a great thunderstorm, and the water flooded Tianjin that night.</p>
<p>The place I lived was neither too high nor too low. The water only flooded the first floor. For the time being, I took the bathtub apart and sent it out through the window, temporarily using it as a means of transportation. This kind of life was naturally too boring, but it was also quite quiet. The running dogs had no way to carry out their spying tricks. Every day I tried to find a way to do something for my faraway friends, but what good could I do?</p>
<p>Others had already acted before me:</p>
<p>It was a drizzly, rainy day after the flood. Outside the window, children were hitting the water with bamboo poles, shouting:</p>
<p>"Another one, another one…"</p>
<p>"Plop!" The bamboo pole hit the water. I peeked out of the window and saw countless paper boats floating down from upstream, and they were all intercepted by the children.</p>
<p>Afterwards, every time I drove out in my bathtub, there were children who would secretly hand me a small piece of paper with active news from the motherland. Everything was worth looking forward to! I remembered my friend's words. Whenever there was a cloudy, rainy day, I always thought:</p>
<p>"Bless the children!"</p>

<p>— Moyu</p>
<p>It's that long summer season of cicada song again. It's been nine years since we parted. These nine years have been such a long dream!</p>
<p>I love you, and I also hate you; I miss you, but at the same time, I plan to never see you again. For these nine years, you have kept me in a sweet and bewildered dream. I have already dedicated all my youth to those years of waiting for you to return; now I have left the edge of the dream and returned alone, and joy and sorrow will fade for me. I only have a contradictory and bitter mood, and the cruel memories and dream traces are deeply rooted in my memory.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have forgotten this annoying yet lovely rainy season! Nine years ago, when we said goodbye amidst the flames of war, the desolate rain and mist were corroding our hearts, which were filled with a faint melancholy. You and I silently walked shoulder to shoulder towards Route Picard. I stared blankly at a drop of water trembling precariously on the tip of a paulownia leaf beside the road. I told you in a low voice that this was probably a symbolic prediction of my future fate. You didn't shake your head bravely, as I had privately prayed for. Your silence gave me the feeling that I had stepped into a demon's realm; I boredly used my cold, trembling hand to wipe the mud off the corner of your clothes, and you suddenly said with hatred:</p>
<p>"The rainy season in Shanghai is really annoying!"</p>
<p>"Weren't you about to leave it?… The interior might be more worthy of longing."</p>
<p>These words of mine touched your imagined bright future. As you happily kissed my dimple with warm and resolute lips, the surge of passion made me unreservedly dedicate my life and blood to you in that night of heavy fog.</p>
<p>I have never been stingy like you in spilling hot blood into the sky of the motherland. A knight-like hero once occupied me, and I have never regretted that a brave and sincere friend like you actually abandoned me; because I knew that you had used the same bravery as you would in love to deal with your enemies, and you had also used the same sincerity as you would with a lover to be loyal to our country. What I can now caress is the last letter you sent from Hengyang. I will keep this letter as a precious gift to be buried with me, waiting for the end of my life.</p>
<p>I especially like to look up at the cloudy rainy season sky now, and I seem to expect to catch a glimpse of the warm projection of nine years ago that I am familiar with; I also especially like to go to the Bund to overlook the turbulent Yangtze River flowing eastward, and I seem to realize that it is the pure and unadulterated priceless sacrifice flowing out of my heart; I am now preparing to send away my remaining youth with distant memories, because this youth originally belongs to you!</p>
<p>The rainy season in Shanghai this year is particularly long, and the greasy rain silk always gently comforts my long-desolate heart; several times I have waded through the flood to Route Picard to retrace the lingering mud that once served as our elegy, the blue serenade passes through the quiet and deep street trees in the dusk, the night fog is still so heavy, the gloomy atmosphere that has never changed in these nine years! Do you know that I have crossed a long and bewildered dream? There are still lingering kisses on my lips, and noble and solemn enthusiasm still flows in my body, but, in the pool of my spirit, there has solidified like the chasms and deep sorrows of the nuns in the Vatican!</p>
<p>I hate you! Why don't you give me continuous possession in my dreams? Let me relive the brilliance and luxury of the past nine years; but at the same time, I plan to never see you again! Because I despise the fact that such a brave and exuberant soul of yours has silently withered into the soil along with the petals of spring flowers; forgetting to comfort a lonely person you once loved deeply!</p>
<p>The long summer season of cicada song is about to pass, and the rainy season is also about to leave my side; I have nothing to cling to in this cruel time, I quietly recite your letter, and I will eternally pray that you have an immortal and never-drying peaceful sleep!</p>

<h3 id="e139">What I Know About Children <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Li</p>
<p>Published every Tuesday</p>
<p>This article is excerpted and introduced to wise parents and teachers from a recent work by Dr. Arnold Gesell, Director of the Child Development Institute at Yale University, published in the May 26th issue of the New York Times Sunday Magazine.</p>
<p>A growing child is truly the most complex organism. He must grow slowly, and he must grow on his own. We can certainly provide him with a suitable environment, but we cannot take over the work of his growth.</p>
<p>This growth process is most clearly manifested in the development of his motor skills. A child goes through more than twenty stages from straightening his body to learning to walk. At first, he can only lie down and lift his head, then he can crawl on his belly, then he will crawl back and forth with his hands and feet, and finally he will stand up and walk.</p>
<p>Similarly, children learn to use their eyes, hands, and fingers step by step. At sixteen weeks, he can only stare at the wooden block, but cannot pick it up with his hand; at twenty-eight weeks, he can clamp it up stiffly like a cat's paw; and at forty weeks, he can hold it with confidence.</p>
<p>This gradual development process also controls children's behavior and attitudes at different ages. For example, patting precedes pushing, drawing a straight line with chalk comes earlier than drawing a curved or oblique line, building blocks will definitely start with a tall tower and then a bridge, ungrammatical short sentences precede complete sentences, playing alone is earlier than group games, and concrete recognition is earlier than abstract concepts.</p>
<p>Common Mistakes</p>
<p>Although teachers and parents often use this natural development process to educate and train children, they do not sufficiently recognize the degree of maturity of children and the process of maturation. Often, children are severely punished simply because they are not mature enough and do not behave properly. Parents (or grandparents) in particular often get angry when their children do not eat properly. In fact, the development of eating and other daily habits depends entirely on the influence of the long-term family environment and the gradual maturation of their own abilities.</p>
<p>The main mistake we make in education is that we overemphasize what children "should" be like, and thus somewhat ignore what children "are" like and what they really "are." This naturally leads to our arbitrary demands and dictatorial educational methods on children.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that we should reward children's bad behavior and indulge them. Unconditional laissez-faire would fundamentally lose the true meaning of education. However, in-depth exploration of the rules of occurrence of erroneous behaviors can help us to implement more enlightened discipline. In all training, we must be able to see ourselves and also see the child, so that our demands do not exceed the child's level of maturity.</p>
<p>Two to Ten Years Old</p>
<p>The following is a brief discussion of the general state of psychological development of children from two to ten years old:</p>
<p>According to the complaints of parents in infant nurseries, two and a half years old is the most confusing and annoying period. A two-and-a-half-year-old child is the most contradictory and irrational. He often makes two opposite demands at the same time: want and don't want; go and don't go; yes and no. He himself is not clear about what he wants, and therefore often easily throws tantrums. At one moment he accepts your meaning, but immediately, for no reason, he rejects it. The reason is like when he is just learning to crawl, but cannot crawl, he can only swing from side to side. A two-and-a-half-year-old child's psychology is in a swinging process of reaching balance, so there is no need to worry. By the age of three, he will become the most lovely and obedient child, and he will slowly learn to make choices.</p>
<p>Three years old is really the happiest period. Although so small, he is already able to master himself. Not only that, but he is also gradually learning to be likable and follow others' instructions. He will ask: "Is this how to do it?" This shows that he has already begun to consciously demand education.</p>
<p>New Developments</p>
<p>But his psychology is still developing recklessly. He will not stay in this relative state of balance for a long time. At the age of four, he will develop in new directions. He no longer cares as much about others' praise or blame as before. If you want him to obey, he will stubbornly ask you "why?" He is always trying to break free from restraints. He is considered to be lying and taking other people's things, because he is really not yet able to distinguish between fact and fantasy.</p>
<p>If managed well, then this outward-expanding four-year-old will slowly come to the constructive five-year-old. He accepts and demands others' guidance and is very obedient, so from the perspective of development, this is another relatively balanced stage.</p>
<p>However, the process of development will soon bring him to an even more troublesome period. At the age of six, he will lose that lovely temper. He becomes very irritable and argumentative, as if he is fighting with himself and with the environment all day long. Sometimes he is very suspicious, hesitant, and violently temperamental, and sometimes he is very gentle and approachable.</p>
<p>However, it should be pointed out here that children at this age are just beginning their school life, and teachers in schools cannot understand this important stage of child psychological development. Education that violates mental hygiene makes children even more irritable and difficult to tame.</p>
<p>New Balance</p>
<p>With normal development, by the age of seven, he will reach a new balance. He is more able to control himself than before, less impulsive, more calm, and gradually establishes feelings for teachers and classmates. He enters a state of absorption and digestion, making progress day by day.</p>
<p>Around the age of eight, he re-enters a period of outward expansion. He automatically comes into contact with the environment and makes friends with classmates amicably.</p>
<p>Thus, by the age of ten, he is more able to adapt to the environment appropriately. He is very cautious and at the same time very alert. He is fearless of anything and does everything quickly. He also likes to compete with others in schoolwork, and he is particularly receptive to knowledge about all aspects of society, and to feel prejudices of right and wrong. He is already able to participate in discussions of major social issues, such as crime, labor management, the black market, etc., so this is really a golden age for the implementation of ideological education.</p>

<p>In Comrade Mu Yan's "Tomato" article in the previous issue, he disapproved of the tomato being called a tomato, because it is similar to a persimmon in shape, content, and color, but not to an eggplant. It would be more appropriate to call it a "Western Red Persimmon", and he said that the word "tomato" is a commonly used term.</p>
<p>The introduction of edible tomatoes to China is only a matter of decades. The name "tomato" may not sound fresh today because people are used to it, and the word "Western" is especially "that", but at the time when it was given a Chinese name, the word "Western" was applicable to everything foreign, and the word "eggplant" was no more suitable. Tomatoes belong to the Solanaceae family in plant classification. In Sichuan, tomatoes are called "Foreign Chili Pepper", and chili peppers also belong to the Solanaceae family. The person who named it at the time may not have known this, but his observation was accurate and gratifying. The tomatoes we can buy on the market are the most common varieties. Other varieties have many changes in color and shape, some are golden yellow, some are yellow-green, some are rose red, some are purplish red, ... some look like apples, some look like cherries, some look like mare's milk, and some really look like eggplants, ... the structure of the flowers and fruits, growth characteristics, uses, etc. are incomparable to persimmons, so I think the common name "tomato" is still worth continuing to use, until a better name is discovered.

<p>Mr. Hani:</p>
<p>I am a girl who grew up in an environment full of smog, and I don't know what is light? What is freedom? I have suffering in my heart, and there is no place to appeal. When I encounter difficult problems to solve, no one discusses with me, let alone guides me. Today, I venture to write this letter to you, please do not disappoint me and point me to a path.</p>
<p>I am seventeen years old this year. I have studied in a voluntary night school for a few years and know some characters. Therefore, my parents, who regard their daughter as a cash cow, always turn my mind from knowing a few characters. First, they wanted me to be a prostitute, saying that the "Long San" girl is one who sells her mouth but not her body, which is not considered vulgar. Later, after my desperate opposition, they changed their minds and wanted me to be a dancer, but I still refused to agree. So they came up with a good idea to have me learn to sing opera. There is a Yue opera actress living across the street from my house, and my mother asked her to introduce me to learn Yue opera. Now things have succeeded, and I don't know whether I should agree or resist. I often hear the teacher say: a woman's economy must be independent, but she must not be other people's plaything. I don't know if being an actress counts as a plaything, please give me a guide. Sincerely wish</p>
<p>You peace, Ni Caiju respectfully</p>
<p>Ms. Caiju:</p>
<p>From your graceful handwriting and smooth sentences, I know that you are a very promising woman. People who only love money and obliterate everything else are not only your parents in this flesh market in Shanghai. You are able to save yourself and are unwilling to be dominated by your parents, which is where you are stronger than others. Based on this, I think that if you cannot find another occupation that satisfies your parents for the time being, learning to sing Yue opera is not impossible. You must know that drama is originally a form of education through personal example. As long as you aspire to be a "female artist" who strives to educate the public, and not a "female actress" who follows the crowd or even sells her beauty, then learning to sing opera is also a legitimate profession. However, in the current morbid society, after you join the drama industry, you will inevitably encounter many obstacles that prevent you from moving forward smoothly. When that happens, you must take out the kind of perseverance you are now resisting your parents with to shatter your obstacles. My answer is like this, I wonder if you are satisfied? Wish</p>
<p>You success in your struggle! Hani</p>

<h3 id="e143">Children's Park Suggestion to the Youth League <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Yesterday, our newspaper colleagues held the second fellowship garden party at the Shanghai branch of the Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. The branch location is very large, and the garden is very clean and elegant. I had heard people say that the place was good, and the Provisional Council had also admired the cherry blossoms there. Yesterday was my first time going, and it was indeed good. It is said that it was originally the garden of the manager of Mitsui &amp; Co. I have been to the residence of the manager of Mitsubishi &amp; Co. on Shanzhong Road, and the scale is comparable to this. Mitsui and Mitsubishi are the largest financial groups in Japan, and their wealth and power can not only sway Japanese politics, but even the Japanese imperial family must yield three points. Now, under the control of MacArthur, this financial group system that exploited the Japanese people has been dissolved.</p>
<p>I browsed this garden-style mansion, small bridge, lotus pond, thatched pavilion, pacing, unable to express a kind of excitement in my heart, why do countless people in this world have no place to stand, and a few people's mansions are connected to the clouds? This large disparity is not only unreasonable, but also not the happiness of mankind, because it will cause resistance. Taking Shanghai as an example, the housing shortage seems to be very serious, but as far as I know, not every house is occupied. There are many houses that are just empty there, and the owners do not even care about gold bars. Many people live in a dozen rooms alone. This phenomenon is really ridiculous.</p>
<p>The garden of the branch is beautiful enough. I feel that if it is used once on an occasional occasion like now, or visited by a very small number of people, I suggest that the Youth League authorities open it to the public, it is better to change it to a children's cultural park. I have the following reasons for this suggestion:</p>
<p>First, to make children often approach the Youth League, have an impression of the Youth League, and gradually become loyal members of the Youth League when they grow up;</p>
<p>Second, the Youth League itself should also do work for children's welfare. Now, using this existing place, without spending money, it can be said to be beneficial without being wasteful</p>
<p>Third, a minimum amount of tickets can be charged as a cleaning fee for the garden.</p>
<p>I don't know if this suggestion can be adopted by the wise Youth League authorities?</p>
<h3 id="e144">Jeep Cars Disregard People's Lives! <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Duyun</p>
<p>A few days ago, our landlady, Mrs. Yao, returned from visiting her relatives. When passing near the Queen's Theater on Tibet Road, she saw a Jeep recklessly crashing and not driving according to regulations. It went on the left and came from the way it was going. The bright lights were like the two giant eyes of a tiger. People were afraid when they saw it. An oncoming car could not dodge in time, grazed the side of the Jeep, and overturned. Both the car and the people overturned. The car was thrown to the side of the sidewalk, and the driver was groaning on the road. Two passengers were thrown onto the sidewalk. Fortunately, the driver struggled to stand up, and the passengers had facial bleeding, but the injuries were not very serious. A passerby said to him: "It doesn't matter, go back and bandage it"!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, before he finished speaking, a three-wheeled car facing forward was hit head-on by the Jeep. The car overturned, and the passenger was crushed by the car body, with blood and flesh blurred. He was lying on the ground, and he seemed to be in pain, and he was still touching his face with his hands. After a while, he died. The man was about twenty years old, wearing a neat Hong Kong shirt, suit pants, a watch and a gold ring, and a Parker gold pen in his pocket. In the end, he bled too much to be saved, alas! Even the driver could not be found. It turned out that he was crushed under the car and died too!</p>
<p>When the tragedy occurred, it was past midnight. For a time, the audience gathered and surrounded the car. Police sirens blared, and the police rushed over. The two American soldiers in the car locked the car doors tightly and smoked cigarettes calmly. The police asked him why he was driving so crazily and reprimanded him a few times, but there was no follow-up. The audience just stared angrily. Mrs. Yao also came back.</p>
<p>The young man who was killed may have been returning from a dance hall, and disaster struck, and joy turned to sorrow. But ordinary people cannot be an exception. The lack of safety in transportation is becoming a fear for Shanghai residents. But the American soldiers did not intentionally hurt people. They must have been drunk and had no control, and were driving the vehicle recklessly, but there is no doubt that they should bear the fault of killing people! It is said that the soldiers who caused the accident were escorted back to their country by their officers for punishment; but if a way to punish the past is not thought of, the traffic in Shanghai is really too dangerous!</p>
<h3 id="e145">The "Face" Problem <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi</p>
<p>It seems a bit incongruous to write about face and traffic together. In fact, it is precisely a kind of morbidity in the city's current traffic. If we want to rectify the city's traffic, we should not avoid treating the disease.</p>
<p>Some people may ask, what is this morbidity like? For example: "speeding", "parallel overtaking", "running red lights", are considered to be having "face" by general drivers! Naturally, what they call having "face" is because the driver is a person with "face", or his driver, using his "face", will not be willing to fall behind, and will not be willing to be bound by the prescribed speed and red lights, and will drive the vehicle as he wants! Anyway, if you violate the rules and cause an accident, there is "face" that can turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing. Therefore, you are like this, and I am like that. Even if there are traffic management rules and regulations that stipulate the methods of banning and punishing, if "face" is not removed, it is equivalent to being a written document!</p>
<p>In fact, people who do not abide by the rules and regulations and disrupt the good order are the most shameless. Not only does he not have face personally, but also causes the country to lose face!</p>
<h3 id="e146">This Trend Should Not Be Encouraged <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Suobei</p>
<p>It may be excusable for a tram to not stop at a station, because some passengers are too "only care about themselves and not others." But the "terminus sign" at the east end is often wrong, clearly going to the Bund, but still hanging "Jing'an Temple", this has to be said to be: "demolition of rotten dirt"!</p>
<p>The original good habits, such as giving up seats and maintaining order, no longer exist; what has replaced them is having me and no one, selfishness and self-interest, getting on and off the car generally climbing in and out of the windows, which is sad! This action is mostly out of "strong currents"; they think that this is "heroic", but it is actually "picnicking"!</p>
<p>We call on: for the integrity of the country's face, this trend should not be encouraged!</p>
<p>People in the car are irritable and prone to temper. If they disagree, they will open their mouths to scold people and start hitting people. They cannot travel together! In "civilized" society, this trend should not be encouraged!</p>
<p>One mouth has two skins, and reason is always right. Getting something for free today is said to be very grand. The most common reason is: "Anyway, it's getting something for free from foreigners"!</p>
<p>Such a mentality, in a word: has no future!</p>
<p>This trend should not be encouraged!</p>
<h3 id="e147">Intelligent People Do Not Give Up Eating Because of Choking, and the Number of Route Trams Should Not Be Reduced. <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>On the seventeenth, Mr. Shaofu wrote an article about trams, saying that his relatives waited for Route 1 tram on Nanjing Road. Once it took 50 minutes, and once it took 30 minutes, but they did not wait, and they lamented that time was wasted.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why there are so few Route 1 trams is because the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company felt that the wind of getting something for free was too great among the passengers on North Sichuan Road. They are all strong currents. Although the authorities posted imperial announcements in the car, telling them to buy tickets like ordinary passengers, they still ignored it and turned a blind eye. The tram company came up with such a passive countermeasure because they had no way to deal with it themselves and the authorities were powerless: reduce the number of vehicles and reduce losses. They would rather abolish Route 1. The few remaining vehicles are still perfunctory, and it is already a great favor to those who travel to and from Jing'an Temple and North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>This method of the tram company is certainly the best policy for its rights! But he forgot his obligation to society. From the standpoint of society, it is strange that the British would completely put public utilities on the point of view of individualism! It is strange and regrettable! What is especially strange and regrettable is that the person in charge of Shanghai public utilities also turned a blind eye, and kept silent, forgetting what he was in charge of. Today's North Sichuan Road is very different from the prosperous situation in the autumn and winter last year. After the initial victory, the enemy nationals here, whether shops or residents, gathered one after another. Many shops along the street were closed, and for a time it felt barren. Reducing the number of trams seemed to have little relationship. Now, the Chinese have moved in one after another, so North Sichuan Road has restored its former prosperity, with a bustling crowd and an unusually lively atmosphere. Moreover, Zhongzheng Park is at the bottom of North Sichuan Road, and the swimming pool there has recently reopened. The improvement of tram traffic on North Sichuan Road is even more urgent. I wonder if the British tram company knows this situation? Do the public authorities know this situation?</p>
<p>If someone asks, how would you be satisfied if we improve it? Then I will bring up the old story again: before the war, I lived in Jing'an Temple for more than a year, and the office was at the bottom of North Sichuan Road. I took the Route 1 tram every day to go out in the morning and return in the evening. The full fare was 18 copper coins, and the time was 45 minutes. There were trams available at any time, even if you had to wait sometimes, it would not exceed 10 minutes at most. Today's requirements, in addition to the fare, the remaining two points can be used as a reference for the authorities. Do you say this is extravagant?</p>
<h3 id="e148">Hope <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>Now taking the tram, from the perspective of passengers, is simply suffering: there are few vehicles and many passengers, which is obviously crowded. It is common to wait for two or thirty minutes without getting on the bus. If a tram comes, people rush to get on first and grab seats. The order is chaotic. Either their feet are trampled, their clothes are torn, or their pocket money is lost. The weather is hot, and many people are crowded together. Those who do not know each other also smoke cigarettes. The smell of smoke and sweat is particularly stuffy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I hope that: passengers should love themselves, line up to get on the bus, and no one should be an exception, so as to avoid the pain of being trampled on the bus. By proceeding in an orderly manner, pickpockets cannot start, which benefits oneself and others. Prepare the fare before getting on the bus, saving the conductor the trouble of finding change. Smoking is strictly prohibited on trams, paying attention to public health!</p>
<p>On the company's side, new cars should be added and put into service. The number of vehicles should be appropriately allocated according to the needs of each line. Damaged vehicles should be repaired as soon as possible, so that everything can be used to its fullest.</p>
<h3 id="e149">It's Hard to Live, and It's Not Easy to Get Around <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Tian</p>
<p>Let me first talk about my experience:</p>
<p>The trolley from Tilanqiao to the Bund is a route I often take and must take. Because Tilanqiao is the Jewish district, there are relatively many blue-eyed and yellow-bearded people coming and going. Although they are a nation without a country, their orderly style of queuing and waiting for the bus is still commendable. Therefore, at the starting point of this station, the "demeanor of a great nation" can sometimes be surprisingly "remarkable." However, sometimes there are fewer trolleys and more people. What to do? Needless to say, it's naturally crowded. It is common for the trolley to be unable to move for a long time. At this time, those "gentlemen" become "bitter oranges from Huaibei." Those who are weak and timid have to give way and wait for the next bit of luck!</p>
<p>Recently, fights have been very common. Ticket sellers and drivers seem to enjoy fighting as much as "Xiao Laotou in 'Killing the Fish Family' loves wearing new shoes for the New Year." The trolley stopped due to a fight obstructs the trolleys behind and congests all the trolleys around—of course, all this goes without saying.</p>
<p>At around four o'clock in the afternoon on the nineteenth, I took a trolley from Tilanqiao to Nanjing Road Bund. The ticket seller and the driver stopped the trolley and went down to fight with someone. I had to get off and walk. I walked to Zhongzheng Road Bund, and the trolley that was fighting had not caught up yet. Aren't all the passengers waiting at the Shiliupu station pointlessly "waiting anxiously"?</p>
<p>It's hard to live, and it's not easy to get around, alas, Shanghai!</p>

<p>Some escaped villains believe that after a long time, there will be no problems. This is simply wishful thinking. But look at Xue Genghua, who once served as the head of the puppet Huangpu Police Bureau and the leader of the intelligence team at "76," who fled to North China after the victory and was finally arrested and sent back to Shanghai recently after nearly a year. This proves that the authorities will never relax their punishment of traitors, which is like a shot of stimulant for the people.</p>
<p>The chief female prosecutor of the Wujin Court Prosecutor's Office prosecuted the president of the court for crimes of corruption and dereliction of duty, which is both gratifying and heartbreaking. What is gratifying is that this chief prosecutor broke the bad habit of officials protecting each other, handled cases impartially, and was unyielding. What is heartbreaking is that the case of prosecuting corruption occurred within the court itself.</p>
<p>A magistrate who was removed from office due to corruption organized a news enterprise company with a capital of 20 million yuan. If this company publishes a newspaper, it should be particularly detailed, accurate, and reliable about general corruption news, unless it doesn't mention a word.</p>
<p>Yu Xiangyan, in the road bureau fraud case, has not yet been arrested and brought to justice. It is denied that there is no need to pursue the arrest. The weather is not so hot that it is possible to save trouble, because she repeatedly said in her letters: "As soon as I recover from my illness, I will definitely turn myself in."</p>
<p>A woman came to the crowd, begging to buy the oranges she was carrying,絮絮言其家境之貧苦，「丈夫兒子都被炸死了，家中還有一婆婆」...，I wanted to ask her why she didn't go to work in a factory, but then I thought it was like joking with her. Workers returning from the rear haven't found work, and there are many workers who have lost their original jobs. Where are there factories that can accommodate her to work? Therefore, I stopped myself from speaking and gave her 1,500 yuan very emotionally, buying three small oranges.</p>

<p>Crossing the road, taking a bus, bumping into walls everywhere, being scolded everywhere.</p>
<p>I am from Tunxi coming to Shanghai. I only feel dizzy from the colorful sights. The country bumpkin seeing the city slicker is a small wizard meeting a great wizard. I feel like a country bumpkin.</p>
<p>One day, I crossed the road, waiting from the red light to the green light and standing for a while before crossing. As I walked across, a rickshaw came horizontally from the left, unexpectedly hitting me and making my eyes go dark. I also heard the phrase "pig head."</p>
<p>One day, I took trolley number one from Haining Road to Qiujiang Road. The trolley was so crowded that it was airtight. I was squeezed on from the back, so of course I had to stand at the door. When the trolley had not yet stopped at Qiujiang Road, the door was already open. I was urged by the passengers and the ticket seller to jump down. I fell and my hands and feet were bleeding, and I was also called "innocent."</p>
<p>Another day, I took a bus from the Great World to Tongfu Road. When getting on the bus, a stack of thousand-yuan bills went away with a dark-glassed, short-dressed friend in the pushing and shoving. I noticed and shouted that there was a pickpocket. The bus arrived at the Mahuo Road stop. He jumped out of the bus and turned his head back and scolded, "stir-fried spicy stuffing." Today, on the way from Daxin Street to Beijing Road on a trackless trolley, a fountain pen disappeared again. I hated it very much. Are country folk repeatedly bullied? I couldn't help but lose my temper in our local dialect. Some of the passengers laughed, and the ticket seller said softly, "thirteen o'clock."</p>
<p>One evening, passing by Zhongzheng Road, a flirtatious woman followed me and said, "Want to play?" I loudly asked what she wanted. She pushed me and said, "Ah-mu-lin" (idiot).</p>
<p>I have learned a lot of Shanghai dialects this way. Is it that I, this country bumpkin, deserve to be scolded, or are country folk being bullied? Please enlighten the readers "me ni"!</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>There is another thing that I consider a great regret, which is that in the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, because the bungalow we lived in had been around for a long time and was becoming dilapidated, and it was filled with the memory of our deceased son Rong, which made us miserable. Therefore, we hired workers to tear it down and rebuild it into a building; who knew that on August 13th, the tyrannical Japanese invaded, and the workers scattered. We had to abandon it halfway, only building a few walls, which aptly fulfilled the old saying "a family with only four walls." For nine years, due to limited finances, we have repeatedly delayed it, and it is covered with vines and weeds, looking like the ruins of Pompeii or the ruins of the Old Summer Palace. It is only for our family to look up and down and reminisce! After we came back, we lived in the three wooden sheds that were built for the children to stay in temporarily, which was truly what is called "slum dwellers." It's pitiful that you lived cramped in this wooden shed, although the interior was still arranged neatly, it inevitably felt like being blown by wind and rain; and on April 23rd, you quietly breathed your last in this wooden shed, not even finding a proper place to die. It really makes me feel guilty and 120 times sorry to you. Your spiritual tablet is set up in the temporary living room in the middle. This is a place that has been tugging at my heartstrings for the past month. During the twelve hours of the day, I knock the chime when I go out and call your name; I knock the chime when I come in and call your name. Every morning, I first offer you a cigarette, then light incense, and offer tea, washing water, breakfast, and fruit one by one before your portrait and ancestral tablet; I also always have to go to the garden to see what new flowers have bloomed, and put them in the three ancient porcelain vases on your left and right and in front, replacing them as they wither, with constant fragrance until now; this is my daily morning routine, and I will not forget it. At noon, I offer rice and dishes as usual, choosing some of the things you liked to eat during your lifetime; you said when you were sick that you liked the new broad beans and the spring bamboo shoots from the garden the most in the spring, and when the bamboo shoots and broad beans were on the market, your body would get better, and you could eat a bowl and a half of rice as usual. I was very happy to hear this, so I asked the old farmer in the garden across the street to pay attention to the growth of the new broad beans for me. Who knew they grew too late, and you couldn't wait to taste them; until the day everyone ate at the Renji Funeral Home. I saw a plate of green new broad beans on the table, which really made my stomach ache and my heart sour, and I couldn't eat it anymore! From that day on, in addition to offering one or two bowls of fish and meat at lunch, there was always a dish of bamboo shoots stir-fried with new broad beans, and this year there were especially many bamboo shoots in the bamboo forest, so every day there were bamboo shoots and broad beans, without interruption until the market ended. I don't know how your appetite is in the underworld? Are you tired of eating them? As for the cigarette after dinner and the snack around four o'clock, offering a cup of milk powder and bread and pastries, I can't forget your favorite bayberry jam, and I always have to spread it on bread to offer you, but whether you can eat it or not is another vague thing that cannot be investigated.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the initial mourning, all four daughters were observing mourning. They could still cry for you every day, but on the day following the first seventh day and the second seventh day, only Bao Mei and Ye Ma cried for you. Although there were noisy Taoists chanting sutras and playing cymbals, they could not cover up the bleak and lonely atmosphere; watching Yun Er wearing white clothes like snow, prostrating alone before the coffin, I couldn't help but shed tears, and hurriedly hid in the farthest corner of the garden. After that, Bao Mei returned to Shanghai, so for the third seventh day and the fourth seventh day, only Ye Ma cried for you, crying so sadly that I was always sad and shed tears beside her. On the eve of the fifth seventh day on May 27th, Bao Mei, Zheng Er, and Mei Er all came back, and invited seven monks from Guanyin Hall to perform a Buddhist service called "paving the blood river"; the next day, they chanted sutras all day long, not daring to set up offerings to disturb relatives and friends; but Zhang Zhenhou and his wife specially rushed from Shanghai to offer incense and pay their respects to you, and the highly respected Zou Jing Lao did not forget this day either, and graciously came. Such high friendship and deep affection will be engraved in my heart for the rest of my life.</p>
