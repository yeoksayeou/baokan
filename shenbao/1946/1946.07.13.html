<p>〔本報訊〕「行總」署長蔣廷黻，昨招待本市中外記者，出席者人數之多、爲近來記者招待曾所僅見。蔣氏當即發表書面談話，對聯總署長宣佈暫停物資運華，有所說明，並答覆各記者紛紛提出之詢問。（圖：蔣廷黻）</p>
<p>聯總職員意見　實有重視價值</p>
<p>對聯總在滬職員聯電聯總署長一事，蔣氏稱：「簽名者雖有到華不久而對於行總各地業務進展情形不甚瞭然之人，然余認爲聯總同事之意見仍有重視之價値。外界對於行總之批評，如確爲明瞭實况而富於建設性者，吾人無不衷心歡迎。」</p>
<p>該電內容，要點有二：（一）聯總物資到華後，未能迅速轉運至需要最大之地帶，致大量物資積存於上海碼頭：（二）物資被利用爲政治工具，分配時含有政治歧視，不合一視同仁之原則。蔣氏謂：如中國與慨物資來華之四十七個友邦間之友好關係，因此而發生不愉快，誠爲最大之不幸，然「所舉之主要事實，則係出於誤解，而於八年創痛之後，在中國實施善後救濟計劃所遇之特殊困難，未加考慮。」</p>
<p>聯總運來物資　大部分已內運</p>
<p>關於物資未能迅速轉運一點，蔣氏之解釋爲：（一）中國與歐洲國家情形迥異，所有交通系統，戰後幾已完全破壞，本年度「行總」上牛年之工作程序，大部時間適値江河水位特低，航行不便，且本年年初，因江運輪隻噸位尙不及戰前之半，物資自不免略有積壓，但至本年七月三日止，「聯總」卸下物資五十五萬九千另四十噸之中，「行總」已內運四十八萬另一百四十噸。四·五·六三個月份，「行總」內運物資數量且超過「聯總」於各該月內在滬進口之數量，如四月份進口八〇·〇九九噸，內運一〇三·二四八噸；五月份進口一〇八·五九八噸，內運一五〇·五一八噸；六月份進口六三·〇一〇噸，內運七八·六三一噸。（二）目前港口碼頭尚存物資七萬九千噸。太平洋戰事突然結束後，最初三個月有海輪十六艘，原係開他國，在公海中轉向來華，所載物資均為聯總所購，以最迅速之方式救濟中國者。「聯總」當局用意之善，令人贊佩，然事實上各輪貨單極不完備，「許多貨箱上亦錯添品名，數千隻貨箱，必須開箱後方能判明內裝何物。」該批物資均係鑒船買來，故「就中為中國需要之物固多，而不在聯總計劃之內，未必爲於中國有用，或雖有用，須俟國內交通恢復後方能使用者亦爲數不少。」遂致「吾人難作有系統之接收，於碼頭倉庫中亦難作有系統之處理。」（三）目前存於倉庫之物資，「聯總並未全部移交，行總亦未全部接收。」（四）聯總運來之美軍剩餘物資，「其中不無損舊之物，亦非全部可以立即使用，因此接收及處理之問題益感困難。」（五）若干物資，必須留滬以便裝配及改製，如卡車須裝配，醫藥器材須裝箱，小麥須磨製成粉，罐頭食品須檢騐（蔣氏曾指出：倉庫中有罐頭食品五千噸，皆係美軍剩餘物資，交來時爛壞者頗多）。</p>
<p>共軍控制區域　辦理救濟不易</p>
<p>關於聯總職員所指摘之第二點，所謂政治歧視問題，蔣氏强調二點：（一）「余爲國民政府特派出席歷屆聯總大會之正式代表，個人即爲參加締構聯總大會議決案之一人，對於大會議決案之精神與原則極爲重視。茲正吿諸君，本署曾不斷努力以合理數量之物資設法運入中共控制區，若謂本署運入中共控制區之物資，不及聯總到華物資百分之二，誠爲最大之誤會，因若干種聯總物資，如機車。鐵路器材·輪船·河防器材等，本署向不配予人民，即卡車本署從不配予任何區域，惟依照工作之必要載運物資行駛各地，以濟災民。」（二）聯總運華物資百分之八十爲食糧，而大部共軍控制區，均爲產糧之地，行總分配物資。自需根據各地需要而定。</p>
<p>蔣氏稱：在共軍制區辦理救濟，確頗不易，但「行總」仍根據蔣主席及宋院長之訓示，與彼本人命令，不避　難，以公平數量之物資源源運往。最近「行總」且已在山東中共控制做設置烟台及荷澤二辦事處，專辦該區救濟事宜。蔣氏因職務關係，曾經常與周恩來董必武二氏保持聯繫，彼等「從未因分配問題向余提出抗議或表示稍有不滿」。行總凡事公開，蔣氏「深信聯總署長於檢討中國工作之實况後即將恢復對華運輸」，而「行總必能貫澈始終而獲得可貴之成功經騐。」</p>
<p>物資停運過久　復興將受影響</p>
<p>蔣氏旋答覆各記者之詢問稱：（一）關於「行總」分配制度之改善，係「行總」執行長之執輩；（二）「聯總」此次決定，主要原因爲倉庫積存物資，以致運輸不暢，其意並非在减少中國之利益。中國最需要者爲糧食及復興器材，目前糧食仍照常接濟，但其他物資若停運過久，則復興勢不免蒙受影響；（三）「聯總」之政策裁決機構爲全體大會及中樞當局，此二會中均有我國代表，此次「聯總」署長之行動，並未經過此二機構。現我國已向「聯總」署長提出交涉，因此次行動係一行政問題而非政策問題，故不能提交大會；（四）「行總」經費之中，行政費係由我國政府支付，業務費中，半係由政府担保，向銀行借貸，半係拋售物資而得，行總至今爲止，業務費之支出約共美金一千萬元；（五）外傳賴伽第亞氏將於月內來華說，蔣氏未有所聞。</p>
<p>聯總署長宣佈　將召回分署長</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署長賴伽第亞今日宣稱：中國分署代理署長賴氏即將召回，其繼任人亦即可宣布。另據聯總消息：上海方面本月十七日將有一委員會舉行臨時緊急會議，討論賴伽第亞宣佈停止救濟物資運華事所引起之各項問題。賴伽第亞並稱：即赴歐洲，俾於八月五日在日內瓦參加聯總理事會會議。歐洲方面救濟事宜將於今年底結束，故該項會議將為最後一次。至於中國方面救濟事宜，雖已規定於明年三月底結束，惟事實上爲中國所造供應物資，屆時未必能完成，故須隨時造成隨時移交，例如澳洲正爲中國分署承造鐵路機寧五十輛非數月所能造成云。（關於我國所得聯總之救濟物資，另有專文刋第八版，請參閱。）</p>

<h3>賴伽第亞談　停運用意　在助華將物資運內地</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕（遲到）聯總署長賴伽第亞今日語記者稱：渠暫時停運物資赴華，並非對中國停止救濟之意，此舉且在助華速將　濟物資運往內地。渠宣稱：緊急糧食仍繼續仍繼續運輸，但上海，九龍，靑島、諸港口所起卸之糧食必須立即運淸。拉氏謂：目前即已有輪船廿艘正在上海卸卸貨，另廿艘刻候空碼頭。渠强調稱：在現已「阻塞為患」之各港口未淸除前，農業工業機器，不致復運。至此二賴氏表示，聯總中國分署職員之請願書上，未影響其行動，渠在未任署長前，即已料及是項行動，聯總中國分署署長不日可公布，惟渠不願指明何人。賴氏並吿記者，聯總行總不同，請勿混淆，渠指摘行總要求「良好物品」，即責聯總以不滿意之物品代替。賴氏坦白表示，依聯總章則，不認政治信仰如何，凡屬需要之區，糧食必須運往。渠稱：內地運輸雖困難，人皆知之但渠相信有改良餘地，渠希望糧食運輸迅速。賴氏並宣布渠於五月廿八日曾致函蔣主席，建議改良供應品之分配方法，以使中國繼續獲得聯總物品。賴氏稱，常已獲政府普通之客氣回答，今晨代理國務卿艾克遜語記者，渠已得悉拉氏已函蔣主席，但拒絕評論目前情勢。</p>

<h3>社論　聯總停運物資來華問題</h3>
<p>華盛頓九日電稱稱：聯總署長賴伽第亞宣佈，即日起，聯總一切工農業設備停止運華，惟重要糧食如小麥，白米，五穀及牛乳仍繼續運華，但亦以中國政府迅速出淸各口岸，及行總將救濟物資運至中國內地，以滿意方法分配爲條件。賴伽第亞這一個意外的行動，聞係根據聯總上海分署一部分官員及職員的報吿，其主要理由有兩點：第一，中國政府沒有供給經費，以致救濟物資，不能迅述分發內地；第二，中國政府對於共軍區域分配太少，因此懷疑政府利用救濟物資作爲政治鬥爭的工具</p>
<p>但據十一日續電，則賴伽第亞解釋此事，謂用意僅在協助中國整理海口之阻塞，而並非停止中國之救濟工作，祗須上海，九龍·靑島這些港口暢通，聯總即可繼續以救濟品運華。此與中國政府發言人前天所說，「一般人最初印象，以爲此乃一種政治性行動，實則由於上海港口擁擠之故，」不謀而合。並且美政府官員更聲叫聯總此舉，不能認爲反映美國政府之意見。可見外面所傳此舉蘊藏着如何嚴重的政治性，顯係別有挑撥意味的宣傳。</p>
<p>對於此事，除了中國政府發言人前天已發表聲明外，「行總」蔣廷黻昨天下午又招待記者，有所答覆。大致說明行總分配救濟品，絕沒有政治區域的分別，全視各地的需要及交通運輸的便利程度而定。且聯運華物資五十六萬噸中，行總內運者已達四十八萬噸。故蔣　長深信賴伽第亞瞭解實情後，必能迅即恢復物資運華。</p>
<p>我們相信，聯總署長此舉，的確由於中國目前的運轍困難而起；同時我們更相信，中國政府和社會人士都非常焦急的在設法疏通運輸。蔣主席訓令中所稱運輸救濟物資及工作人員，優先待遇，不得留難或阻碍，應該可認爲代表中國政府能態度。據上海中華碼頭公司總經理劉念智說，近來本市各碼頭及倉庫擁塞情形，較前已略見進步，惟公家及聯總所堆存之物資仍夥，往往數月不動，致外來船隻載貨不能隨到隨卸，滯留港內的平均每日達二十艘。即此可知社會人士對於上海港口之疏運工作，也在迫切注意和努力改善之中。現在經聯總署長宣吿暫時停運工農業設備的刺激，大概更可使我們那些負責管理運輸的人加緊疏運。果能如此，則誠如賴伽第亞的解釋，救濟品自然即可繼續運華，當無疑義。</p>
<p>但是，無論如何，我們非常惋惜聯總署長舉動的突厄，同時更惋惜，田聯總中國分署一部分官員和職員對於中國情形或許挾有若干偏見。這次世界大戰，中國受戰禍最久，工農業方面破壞最劇，如像湖南廣西的　饉，大部分就是由於遭敵人破壞所造成。交通和工業方面。先經日軍的摧殘，後經共軍的毀壞，尤覺破碎不堪。世界上沒有一個國家工農業的復原，比中國更需要的救濟的。救濟物資停運，將使大部分中國人，受到更深長的痛苦。這當然不是聯合國善後救濟總署所以設立的初衷，更有違背於美國故大總統羅斯福博施濟眾拯救生靈的宏願。何一種物資迅速普循運到內地窮困之區，確非易事。而運輸費何一種物資迅速普徧運到內地窮困之區，確非易事。而運輸費之鉅，更難想像，一船物資的卸貨開支就需法幣一萬萬元，倉庫堆棧費還不在內。中國政府在戰後財政極度困難的時候，還是在預算案中撥出四千三百二十萬萬元，而爲達到迅速分配物資起見，行總不能不出售一部分救濟物資，但是並沒有超越杜魯門總統所定的原則，即出售的一部份聯總物資，祗用以補經費之不足。現在聯總分署的一部分人，竟來指責中國政府沒有供給足够經費，並且主張行不應出售救濟物資，於情於理都是不合的。</p>
<p>至于共軍所佔區械，中國政府也從來沒有歧視。中國政府是代表全中國人民的政府，當然一視同仁，對救濟工作絕無畛域之分。恰恰相反，行總救濟品經過中共區域，常常被共軍强扣，不能發到災民手中。最近兩月內發生的：（一）行總自運城運出棉籽二千餘斤，於稷山被扣；（二）行總目濟南運往聊城的麵粉八八五袋及奶粉若干，在聊城外被扣；（三）行總卡車十四輛空車自濟南間青島時，道經益都被扣。這幾件事，都曾經電周恩來要求發放，但是到現在還沒有接到報吿。然而共軍儘管扣，行總還是在努力將救濟品遝往共軍區域，譬如昨日運一千三百噸往烟台，最近又常有救濟品運往蘇北。這都是不爭的事實。</p>
<p>根據行總署長蔣廷黻的說明，糧食的救濟，中共所轄區域，大抵產糧，本來需要較少，倒是醫藥品需要甚大，行總常常購買大批醫藥品米供給，因為聯總有時不能供給這種要求。至於共軍到處破壞交通，使運輸救濟物資，愈感困難，各軍號令不一，使工作人員也無法開展，也都是有目共見。現在聯總分署一部分人想把一切責任，完全加在國民政府，因而建議聯總停止供應物資來懲罰中國的人民。幸而聯總署長聲明，並不是根據他們的理由，就停止一切救濟品的運華，否則將成爲極不智的為行動是不智呢？因爲現在正有若干份子一方面擴大他們的「反美」宣傳，一方面向削弱國民政府的信譽，故任何機會都要利用。我們只要看聯總署長的命令一發表，南京和北平的中共發言人就先後發表長　談話，跨大行總配運物資之不公，而美國共黨赫登也就代表所謂「中共救濟協會」，宣傳共區並沒有得到什麼救濟物資，蛛絲馬跡，就可知道中共和它的同類是在怎樣唱着雙簧，盡力於離間中美友誼的工作。惟其如此，我們認爲聯總儘可切實與中國政府籌商改善運輸的方法，決不可因噎廢食，停止救濟物資的運華，給了這些「反美」宣傳家一個新的機會。</p>

<h3>四外長兩日討論結束　德國問題未獲協議　決延會至十一月間重開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」舊金山十二日廣播：今午四强外長會議重開時，貝爾納斯對於分割德國之經濟障碍再施抨擊，要求蘇聯贊助統一計劃，並暗示蘇聯倘能接受此項計劃，美國允將美佔領區內賠償物資運往蘇聯佔領區區。此次會議恐爲末次會議，貝爾納斯準備於星期六搭機返國。莫洛托夫提議於本日結束會議。四國外長均亟欲返國、俾於出席七月二十九日和平會議以前得有休息機會。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：貝爾納斯今日以辛辣之言辭指責蘇聯，由於西萊西亞及康尼斯堡東普魯士區域之割讓，業自德國間接直接獲得一百四十億元之賠償物資，以答復莫洛托夫一再提出根據雅爾達協定向德國索取一百億元賠償物資之要求。貝氏昨日於演說中斷然聲明該項協定迄未成立。渠稱，依照波茨坦規定，蘇聯賠償物資應自該國佔領區內取得，而以西部之有限工廠設備爲補充。並稱，蘇聯自蘇佔領區業已獲得之賠償物資，無法估計確數。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕四國外長會議今日賡續開會，並決定俟本月十三日再度會議之後，即宣吿延會至本年十一月間，再舉行臨時會議討論德國問題。本日會議歷四小時半，討論賠償問題，設小組委會調查德解除軍備實况問題，以及其他與國有關之問題，均未能成立協議。本日會議係蘇外長莫洛托夫主席，當即要求四强決定延會日期，美國務卿貝爾納斯答云，必須先將德奧問題討論完畢乃可，但四強終於同意於十三日延會，並於明日上下午開會兩次，俾克結束現行工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕外長會議今日竟日討論德國問題，貝爾納斯提議，德國其他三佔領區之一區或全體，須加入美軍區合組統一經濟、最好能依照波茨坦協定，在全德設立中央經濟機構。渠復建議薩爾區不妨暫不列入此等經濟機構之管轄範圍以內，仍由法國管治，以待德國西疆問題成立最後解決辦法。貝文亦建議减輕德國各佔領區間之經濟壁壘，使物資得以自由交換，悉遭莫洛托夫之反對。貝文乃聲言英國已不擬繼續借債維持英軍區內之救濟工作，英軍區內之工業必須使其恢復生產，使全區不再完全倚賴英國，故建立全國之統一經濟，憑各佔領區之經騐，促進橋國之經濟自立能力，實爲一最佳之建議。四外長討論良久，結果仍無協議。最後仍同意莫洛托失之要求，決定於聯合國全體大會閉幕後，再舉行外長會議之特別會議，討論德國問題。</p>

<h3>火星上也有植物　蘇聯天文家說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕蘇聯科學界發現火星兩極區生長植物，並有高大之樹木，現正硏究中。據蘇聯科學院研究員著名天文學家帶克霍夫教授稱：將來第一批星球探險家到達火星時，將發現與地球上相同之一種植物。火星之兩極區，堆積冰雪，與地球相同。火星上之「海洋」，實即植物區域，各區該域冬季碧綠，一如靑苗；迨至夏季則又呈褐色，一如被太陽灼熱然。此種見解，引起其他若干科學家之爭辯，其中如夏羅諾夫教授稱：此項植物受紅外綫之影響，照相機所照出者適得其反；換言之，火星之植物應爲白葉者，自地球上攝影，即成深色。蒂氏加以反駁謂：根據地球上各種植物觀察所得，凡在嚴寒氣候下生長之植物，均吸收紅外綫，故其發射紅外綫，較溫和氣候下之植物爲少。余信在火星之氣候嚴寒中，該項植物已失去散發紅外錢之力量云。</p>
<h3>菲農民武裝暴動　憲兵已馳赴呂宋彈壓　左傾遊擊隊數逾三萬　羅哈斯總統謂可望和平解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十二日電〕呂宋島中部之「人民抗日軍」爲反政府派遊擊隊，由武裝農民組成，數在三萬人以上。呂宋中部因不斷處於恐怖狀態之下，其中人口最密之巴姆邦加·泰拉克·布拉千·新埃西嘉等四省，米產將大受影響·「人民抗日軍」對羅哈斯之聲明尙未正式答覆，目前又發生衝突。羅哈斯總統未就職前，「人民抗日軍」與擁護政府派之遊擊隊，及菲憲兵衝突之報吿，幾日有所聞。雙方死傷甚多。該軍係在八打雁島陷落後不久所組成，所有軍械係自戰場上取來，美日軍器均有。該軍領袖爲泰魯克，年卅二歲，太平洋戰爭爆發時，爲呂宋島中部農民協會秘書，曾一度任職政府，以思想左傾被黜。美軍收復菲津賓後，一度被拘。後當選為菲律賓下院議員候選人，言以民主同盟副總裁身份呼籲組織更民主化之政府，實行土地改革。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十一日電〕巴姆邦加省政府實力今日幾已倍增，憲兵一千人今晨突然開到此一農民暴動中心。羅哈斯總統今與新埃西嘉省胡克族領袖特利洪會議後，發表聲明，謂和平解決頗有希望。</p>
<h3>原子彈試驗　初步報告</h3>
<p>白朗第謂投彈未準</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕聯合參謀團專家委會主席康普登今日向杜魯門總統提出報告書，謂比基尼原子彈轟炸試騐，已獲得適當紀錄，以備軍艦從新設計，减少軍艦上層及甲板上人員損失至最低限度。此次試騐所消耗人力物力，自所獲紀錄及减少猜測距離兩方面觀之，自屬正當。原子彈損毀艦船較任何一次轟炸損失爲多。此次試騐，原子彈在預定高空向靶子艦投擲，其爆炸之强烈，較以前三枚原子彈不相上下。距中央四分之三哩以外之軍艦，損失較輕，但經研究閃光影響及輻射能結果，證明在曝露之人員中死傷或將甚高。艦上人員即使受艦壳掩護，並居於輾射能之陰面，亦將立被灼傷。至於試騐費用，則尙無可靠估計。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞赴比基尼島十一日電〕原子彈試騐總指揮白朗第中將談稱：第四原子彈如在「尼伐達」號戰艦直綫上空爆裂，則該艦或已沉沒，或已全毁。按此說與渠日前所謂原子彈業已擊準目標顯有出入。至某記者所謂原子彈係在預定時間兩秒鐘前爆炸，頃已經白朗第否認。</p>

<h3>中央航空公司　滬平班飛機失事　死傷達四十餘人　濟南附近起火墮毀　機航組主任今晨親自駕機前往調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司滬平班機，昨日午後四時卅分，在濟南機塲附近失事焚燬，該機係行駛滬·京·青·濟·平線，機號「十五號」，係由C-46型運輸機改裝。昨晨八時由該公司素有飛行經騐之沈華德機長任駕駛員，何啟昭任助理駕駛員，李君任無線電操縱員，自龍華機塲起飛，中途曾平安停靠南京，青島二站，迄午後四時抵達濟南城外機塲。四時十分，該機又由濟南起飛，飛行約十分鐘後，左冀發動機突發生障礙，沈華德機長當即駕機折返濟南，乃未及安全降落機塲，該發動機已起火燃燒，致十五號機被迫降陸於機塲鄰近數里荒郊。該機除裝載貨物外，並載有乘客，出事時，頗有傷亡。已證實者為助理駕駛員與無線電操縱員均死，沈機長重傷。機航組主任陳文寬已於今晨八時親自駕機飛濟南調查失事原因。據悉該公司自創立以來，飛機失事此次尚屬初次云。</p>

<h3>台下人喝彩台上人心酸　馬連良昨遭傳訊　表示問心無愧　由孫蘭亭等保出繼續參加義演</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕名伶馬連良為人檢舉附逆事，經冀高署偵查後，除已將馬伶在北平之住宅查封外，並於日前下令通緝。馬在滬之動向，遂為人所矚目。前晚上海高院接得通緝令，立即由四名法警送至天蟾舞台經理室，限馬於昨晨向法院投案，由冀高院派人來滬迎提歸案。當晚馬即表示輟演投案，惟救濟蘇北及湘災難民籌劃義演之各方負責人，因馬在義演中號召力頗強，當即代為請求待馬義演完畢後再行投案，並由孫蘭亮等三人負責保證，因事關善舉，故高院准其所請。</p>
<p>昨晨十時許，馬即向提籃橋高院投案，由檢察官開庭訊問，馬表示老母子女等皆在北平，所作問心無愧，待義演完畢後，即去北平。偵訊畢交原保外出，故昨晚馬仍登台天蟾，為蘇北及湘災籌募捐款，與梅蘭芳合演「打漁殺家」。現衆滿座采聲時起。</p>
<p>昨晚記者特至天蟾後台訪問馬連良，詢當年去「偽滿」經過，據稱：民國卅一年八月間，瀋陽回教會以籌措東北回教中學經費，公推董事長左叔倫到平邀赴東北演義務戲，余為回教徒，教胞籌款與學本應加以贊助，惟自七七事變以還，不欲涉足偽滿，對於東北十餘次之邀請，均一一謝絕，故未即允之，後忽有日人貞鳥以「滿洲演藝協會」名義偕同「三六九畫報」社長朱復昌前來迫令簽訂合同赴滿演營業戲，彼　憑日軍報道部之後援，施用威脅手段，雖一再推却，終不如願，乃與之約定抵東北後先為回教演義務戲後再唱營業戲。然抵瀋陽後，彼等忽改變初議，堅欲先演營業戲，當時處於不自由之環境中，對此唯有聽之。於是在瀋陽國際戲塲唱營業戲二十天，在瀋陽義務戲十二天，復在長春首都戲院唱營業戲五天，為聲啞學校等義演二天，最後在哈爾濱華樂舞台演營業戲九天，共計在東北先後唱營業戲卅四天，賣座尚不惡，共得包銀偽聯幣八萬元，此回教有賬可查。故東北之行，除為回教義演外，實為營業性質，並無「文化使節」名義，亦未接受偽華北政府任何委任文件。而所演者均係舊劇，日方前曾禁演之民族正義劇本如串龍珠，蘇武牧羊，四進士等，故在東北除演戲外，從未有為敵偽宣傳，亦未在何處參加敵偽慶祝。勝利後自平來滬，外界指係逃罪，實則上海並非租界也。故一俟梨園公會及助學金等義務戲演完後，即將趕返北平。馬又謂：此次白部長去東北，對東北回教中學之設立，曾加贊塲，並有信可證明云。</p>

<h3>偽大使吳凱聲　滿口地下工作　提出證明文件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾任偽外交部次長，偽駐義大使之吳凱聲，昨在高院再度受審。吳供稱：戰前服務外交界，後執行律師業務，戰起即從事救濟工作，上海淪陷後，曾掩護交通部工作人員，在私寓設立秘密電台。後為日人發覺，加以壓迫恐嚇，乃於廿九年六月掛偽考試院考選委員會會員名義，以作掩護。但該項偽職並無薪俸。後偽外交部長褚民誼又未得本人同意，委為駐義公使大使銜，但從未出國。繼又不徵求同意派任偽外交部次長，但未到任。然自民國廿六年起至抗戰勝利為止，本人一直是在幹地下工作。此在中央曾有備案登記。與重慶往來有三四次電報，其中有一次係直接致蔣主席者。任內曾營救被捕地下工作人員朱紹祥姚交湛等。又替美國駐京代表發茨登收集情報，此一切皆有證明文件，並非口頭空講云。當庭由辯護律師呈上證件甚多，並由孫挹英到庭作證，謂被告確曾與軍統局發生關係。庭論該案至十八日上午再審。</p>

<h3>京滬長途電話　準備增設綫路</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據交通部上海電信局郁秉堅局長語記者，該局現有之設備較戰前相去遠甚，而業務則反較戰前為興旺，故雖有員工二千餘人，尚難應付。電報擁塞之主因，或由於在現時物價下報費太廉，惟加價　關重大，尚待政府決定。以前計劃之上海紐約間國際通話，因器材尚未輸入，一時尚難籌辦，京滬間長途電話情形，現已稍為改善，最近並在準備增設綫路中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕海上「白相聞人」謝葆生，早年曾赴關外蒙古一帶販賣馬疋，故又有「馬夫葆生」之綽號。在滬經營仙樂舞廳，卡德浴室等業。雖「交友」廣闊，門徒衆多，但胸無點默。因曾於三十二年九月出任偽江蘇省警務處副處長，故於勝利後被捕，並曾一度在高院受審。昨日再審時，謝辯稱：一向愛國，所做地下工作多得很。廿六，廿七，廿八年間，曾與溫台防守司令聯絡，冒險代運鋼條，水門汀收音機等軍用品，又捐助七一軍棉制服五百套。太平洋戰起，過去蒙古販馬時之老東家英人馬立斯被拘入集中營，曾屢以物品接濟，後因所做工作為日人發覺，乃出任偽職，用以掩護。做了四月的「官」，就想辭職，但未得核准，就糊裏糊塗做下去。但任內未曾開過一次會，批過一次公交，一切事都有正處長在負責，我不過作傀儡而已。該案改期再訊，被告仍還押。</p>

<h3>颱風由閩入贛　（上海）　可免襲擊</h3>
<p>據悉，此次颱風來源係由呂宋島之北緯二十度，東經一二五度，於十日下午二時開始發動，當時風力薄弱，後因北部高氣壓關係，風力轉強，直向西北推進，至隔日上午八時到達台灣花連港之東，轉向北之西北部份，下午再轉台北附近，風力並不強大，每小時約二十英里，繼而轉向西北進抵大陸，風力每小時退至十六英里，週圍直徑為一五〇英里，昨晨十時到達福建霞浦附近，至晚七時當到浙省衢州，安徽歙縣之間，更成尾聲，預計今天風力可全部消失，不致向上海襲擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕據中央氣象局報告，颱風中心十二日上午七時在北緯二十六點九度，東經一一七點八度，時速十七公里，由閩北向贛省進襲，惟勢漸趨衰弱。</p>

<h3>路局大舞案　口供中找出線索　後日繼續審訊將有新發展</h3>

<h3>衛生局招待記者　參觀防疫設施　注射防疫針已達百卅餘萬人　北車站童子軍服務精神可佩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午二時，衛生局招待本市新聞界參觀防疫設施，各報記者到約三十餘人，先在市政府二〇九室集合，由張局長報告最近防疫工作進行狀况後，即分登訪局備就之專車六輛，由人事處處長陳邦憲，環境衛生處處長江澄世領導，向預定之目的地出發。</p>
<p>昨日參觀處所，計有西藏路上海時疫醫院，閘北霍亂流行區域，北火車站檢疫工作之進行，天通庵路市立第一傳染病院，及楓林橋中山醫院，最後由張維局長招待於青年會晚飯後始散。</p>
<p>經過這一次的參觀後，記者覺得這一個月來，衛生局對於防疫工作的努力，是無法抹殺的，這在記者昨天親見的事實上，充分地表現出來。凡在霍亂流行區域的垃圾，衛生局天天派員注射DDT，市民現用的土井，每天都用氯氣消毒。經消毒的土井，為數在五千以上。並且對於病家消毒，極為認真。凡是有一個　性霍亂患者被發現後，立刻消毒全家，並在附近設立注射隊，強迫鄰近居民注射疫苗。現經衛生局注射的人數已達一·三五五·二一〇人，昨天一天，就已注射二二·五〇〇人。注射成績最佳的是在北站，總計一天可以注射一萬五千人，而站中童子軍的服務精神，實在是足以受人感動的！他們半推半拉的把沒有疫證的旅客拖向注射站，近平哀求的請你打一針，這種苦累的工作，非年輕力壯的小伙子，是誰也担當不了的。但是童子軍正日以繼夜的努力着，他們並不需要任何酬報，據他們一致的表示，軍警的不肯合作，是他們唯一的痛心，這正像陳處長所說：「中國人有個壞習慣，認為能够不守規矩，就是自己的神氣！」但是防疫必須是全面性的，希望各界能予以密切合作！</p>
<p>〔又訊〕防疫委員會公告：昨日霍亂患者八十七人，死二人，連前共一七九二人，死一二八人。據衛生局統計結果：本市患者之死亡率約為七·三％，與廣州市本年患者之死亡率三〇％相比，遠為低落。</p>
<h3>上海時疫醫院　需用大量食鹽</h3>
<p>本市西藏路上海時疫醫院，連日霪雨中，前往就診者，仍非常擁擠。每日有七百人以上，七月五日天稍放晴，病人激增，所有免費病床一百隻，無日不告額滿該院為一私立之慈善醫院，因醫務繁重，開支浩大，經費異常拮据，甚盼社會人士予以全力援助，慷慨捐輸。又該院為救治霍亂病人，每日應用鹽水一千二百磅，急迫需要大量生理食鹽，亦希各界人士捐贈。</p>

<h3>甘省各級教育概況　教育經費已佔全國第六位　國立蘭州大學定暑期成立</h3>
<p>甘肅爲我國文化發祥之地，今爲西北之中心，惟以交通阻梗，經濟困難，人才缺乏，教育文化事業，發展較爲遲滯。抗戰軍與，甘肅地位益形重要，推進教育，以配合抗建需要，實爲急不容緩之事。　通和（西谷）氏適於其時出長該省　　，積極推進全省教育事業，經八年努力，得以奠定基礎：</p>
<p>高等教育</p>
<p>（甲）萬等教育方面：甘肅原僅有省立其　學院一所學生約五十人。近年經省府協助，中央先後在甘創設國立西北農業專科學校，國立西北師範學院，及國立西北醫學院，並將省立甘院改歸國立。現在西北農專有學生四百餘人，西北師院有學生一千餘人，西北醫學院有學生一百六十餘人，甘肅學院有學生三百餘人。本年暑假成立國立蘭州大學，由甘肅學院西北師院，西北醫學院等合併改組而成，並將設立文理工各學院。此外爲鼓勵中等學校畢業生升學，養成各種專門人才起見，曾訂定甘肅省國內各院校甘籍學生獎學金章程。凡本省學生肄業國內各大學或獨立學院者，均由省府給予獎學金。此項獎學金額，逐年提高，領取獎金之學生，亦逐年增多，計二十七年五四人，三十四年增至七八二人，約增十五倍。</p>
<p>中等教育</p>
<p>（乙）中等教育方面：過去甘肅中等學校、策中於滿洲，天水，平凉，臨洮等少數都市，分佈不均，省城及外縣各校經費，亦多寡不一。漫無標準。二十七年冬，鄭氏蒞任之初，即訂定中等學校編製預算標準，外縣學校經費逐年提高，至三十一年，全省中等學校一律照標準十足發放、過去偏枯倡東之弊，得以免除。至於學校及班級之增設，曾訂定分區　校增級計劃，全省分蘭州，臨洮，天水，平凉，隴西，武威，酒泉，慶陽，臨夏，武都等十個中學師範區蘭州，隴南，隨東，河西四個職業學校區。在學校較少或竟未設學校之區，分年推設學校，班級亦逐年增設。七年來學校數，年級數，與學生數之增加如下：（二十七年）中學一五所，學級六八級，學生三。一〇三人，師校一四所，學級六六級，學生二·五二三人，職校五所，學級二四級，學生七〇眔人·（三十四年）中學五九所，學級三六七級，學生三。五四七人，師校二三所，學級一八八級，學生六，七〇九人，職校一五所，學級九五級，學生二。六七五人。中學發展最速，師範次之，職業學校增設校少。</p>
<p>初等教育</p>
<p>（丙）國民教育方面：甘肅全省學據見單約七十萬。據二十七年統計，入學兒童僅十五萬左右，失學兒童約百分之八十，經七年努力，中心國民學校已設八二五所，達到每鄕鎭一校之標準。保國民學校已設六七二五所，尙有五〇〇保，未設學校，預定在三十五年度設齊。所有中心學校及國民學校，均於三十年度起，按照規定籌足基金。除超齡兒童外，全省學齡兒童，已入學者約佔百分之四十九。至於或人補習教育，亦經逐漸推行，如隴東特教區各縣國民學校，普遍設置民教班。（丁）社會教育方而：甘肅已設省立民教館四所，省立圖書館一所。各縣民教館，除極少數偏僻縣份外，均已設立民教館。國民體育亦經積極提倡，每年雙十節，全省分區舉行運動曾。他如播音教育。電影教育等，亦經規劃辦理。抗戰期間，其省雖環境艱苦，而教育事業得能迅速發展，一面由於教育人員之努力，一面亦由於經費之大量增加。當抗戰開始時，其省教育經費，在各省中僅佔第十八位，現已升至第六位。若以人口及經費增加倍數計算，在各省中且佔第一位云。</p>

<p>水淸潔得發靑，池中只有寥寥可數十幾個人，半數還是外僑，凄凉的樣手眞不如往年，大概不外下雨，天氣凉快，外界還不知已經開放三種原因。　男子更衣室里一些沒有人多的嘈雜聲，池中更沒有一位穿着艷麗游泳衣的小姐來點綴這開幕日。</p>
<p>據說，濾水機器已全部修好，因此水可長期保持淸潔，不必時常更換，一池的容水量爲三百二十萬加侖，水價約在一百八十萬元左右，池旁並將開一酒排間，以供游泳人士充飢解渴。</p>
<p>我們也許以爲門票稍貴了一些，因此我們不妨希望天熱，天熱人擠，票子可多賣去，也許可能减價。〔鼎〕</p>

<h3>擬組織商業公斷會促進中美間貿易　李銘卡遜被推主任委員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據中美工商業協進會駐華代表施芳蘭女士告本報記者稱：中美兩國之關係方面，刻正硏究組織一兩國間商業糾紛之公斷委員會，俾便處理中美貿易上所發生之一切疑難與糾葛。渠稱：最近中美工商協進會理事長福阿瑟氏，在美國商業公斷社之宴席上，曾爲此事發表演說，渠認爲中美商業上公斷機構之設立，實足以促進兩國商業上之友誼關係，且預測該項機構前途之發展，必極光明遠大，緣中國古時之商業及個人間之關係，均極注重公斷精神，時至今日，公斷　神，在中國商業·勞工·及海事種種關係上，更形重要。溯中國第一種公斷條例，尙係一九二一年北京政府司法部所頒佈，該項條例，復於一九三五年時，經國民政府實業部重行審定，此外中國之商會法·勞工法等，對公斷仲裁之規定，均頗週詳，故中國在商業各方面之公斷措置，早具基礎，茲者以美國早已廢棄在華之治外法權，故在華美商經營事業，一切悉秉中國之法律，惟外商與中國法律，發生新關係伊始，偶有貿易上之糾紛，純由法院處理，難免有延擱之情事，故為加速解決中美商業可能發生之糾紛計，應速自兩國商業領袖界，遴選幹員，組織中美商業糾紛公斷委員會，據美國商業公斷社消息，一九四五年初，該社曾接受美國務院之請，提供備忘錄；建議在中美兩國之商業關係上，應建立一商業糾紛之公斷機構，以處理一切可能發生之疑難或糾葛，該項建議書，亦曾提交中國政府，加以核准，並曾指派中國銀行及商業方面之領袖人物六人，組團來美，與該社所委派之美國工商界領袖二十人會商，提倡組織一中美互惠之商業公斷機構，茲悉我國李銘氏與美國卡遜氏，業被推爲組織委員會中之主任委員，該會刻正計劃早日組成此項公斷機構，並積極草擬一切有關之章則及規程，據悉美商業公斷社國際公關部王任威頓氏，即將於最近期內來華一行，以便計劃在華樹立該項公斷機構云。</p>
<h3>金銀　黃金流通加速　美國銀價未定</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕世界黃金，目前正加速向若干自由市塲移動，（其中一部分係來自極出人意料之處，如英格蘭銀行之類），且在某種情况，此種黃金之移動，或更將加速，美國黃金存量之巨大變化，亦即將成爲可能，但倫敦金業界人士，不欲此項黃金流達印度，至於白銀，則數年內，千百萬兩之鉅量白銀，仍將流　國云。</p>
<p>參議院前於星期三建議折衷辦法，將銀價定爲每盎斯九〇·三元，昨日衆議院已投票予以否決，按衆議院堅持，應將銀價定於每盎斯七一·一一元。</p>
<h3>紗價平穩　花布疲弱</h3>
<p>昨日紗市尙稱穩定，最初雙馬紗雖稍叫高，然收市時又復回落至一二九萬，中小型紗以紅彩兩魁星交易最盛，價較上日约好一萬之譜，雙股綫有人收購，價升二萬，脚地殊堅，午時紡建公司照例掛牌開紗，價與本星期三所標者相仿，無甚出入。</p>
<p>坯布又轉軟化，因實需不暢，同時上日紡建公司繼續供給，於是人心帶疲，惟三A彩球細布北方吸胃尙强，依然堅挺，餘者一致下挫五百元至七百五十元。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊，再漲廿九至卅七磅音，計近期美金三三·八，遠期三四·一，米特林現貨三四·五六，本埠現棉純受美棉連日騰踊影響，執貨者愈形居奇，致交易稍形減色，僅南通大生及無錫慶豐兩紗廠稍有採辦云</p>
<h3>台糖延期標售</h3>
<p>標價傳有回小可能</p>
<p>臺灣糖業公司第六期臺糖標售，本定昨日舉行，但因上期之各項手續，尙未辦理完竣，各糖商均有充分之存糖，各門市店家，亦無缺糖現象，故該公司決定延期三日，定下星期一舉行，至其標售之價格，亦已決定，務使糖價逐步回小云。</p>
<h3>吳市長曉諭米商不得拒售配給米　否則決予吊銷執照　糙米碾白亦不許可</h3>
<p>吳長昨日召見本市米號業公會代表瞿振華氏，對本市各米號拒售配給米情事極為震怒，面論瞿氏氏轉吿各米號，以後如再有藉故推諉拒售配給米違反規定者，決予以吊銷執照，當經瞿氏對市府配給米先納糧款辦法有所陳述，據吳市長表示，米號對配給米先付糧款，如有困難，應由米業會呈請市府核示，在可能範圍內，市府富予以協助。</p>
<p>糧價審議會昨日舉行第五次例會，會議決定（一）白米價格仍照前評定者不予變更，（二）第四次例會中米商提出之配給米，俟售　時再行付款，及將糙米碾白出售之提案，除第一項已簽請市長決定外，對將糙米碾白出售，社會局方面爲避免少數米奸商以糙米碾白，混充上白米出售起見，決不予討論。又昨日南北米市塲到貨較稀，計南米市場到米五百三十四石，北米市塲到米一千七百七十六石，自運　銷者一千七百七十七石又四十五包，合計四千〇八十八石又四十五包，本市各米號已普遍有米公開發售。</p>
<p>平價米昨亦有少數米號領貨發售，社會局規定每天發售低價米之數量爲五千石，必要時當再設法增加。</p>
<h3>祁紅在議價中　本銷頗為活潑</h3>
<p>茶葉一項，本街店莊等以目前茶銷當令，添置仍殷，交易活躍異常，惟價格大致站住，至於洋莊茶市，連日在英商協和洋行與執貨者數度磋商之祁門陳紅茶，刻下已微露曙光，但尙乏正式成義，聞談價每担僅在九萬元光景</p>
<h3>陽泉白煤將到　開平屑極呆滯</h3>
<p>煤市白煤已聞有到貨訊，陽泉白煤五百噸，约於一星期後即可抵滬，然行市仍因近日存低稀薄，貨主居奇，續見微挺，烟煤塊高檔貨，亦因缺貨，繼續喊高，唯開平二號層仍滯銷，價格跌進配價，其原因爲隴海及浦口一帶燃煤供應較爲困難，而滬地工廠不景氣，廠銷極呆，故前有向華東及淮南辦煤者運至浦口，即爲燃管會收買，以八折付給上海燃管會浦東交貨之開平二號層棧單，因此更供過於求矣，</p>
<h3>推動茶葉出口　另辦低利貨款</h3>
<p>具體辦法在磋商中</p>
<p>茶葉以成本高昂，對於輸出貿易一時無法推動，中央銀行擬舉辦出口貸款，連日與茶商洽談，其計劃係依茶商在海外賣出之定貨，取得海外客戶開具信用匯票後，即可向該行抵押，該行方面僅收取茶商低利息，以協助茶商資金流通，不必俟貨運到收款，以冀成本减低云。</p>
<h3>經濟簡報</h3>
<p>燒碱　昨由香港轉口來滬之燒碱，聞又有二千餘桶到埠，昨日市價，爲四十一萬元，外幫採辦甚稀，價有再下瀉勢。</p>
<p>賽璐璐　近月以來，滬市玻璃用具，充斥市塲，皆標明新到美貨，茲聞此次玻璃製品，多爲此間外商某國人利用賽璐璐製造，賽璐璐現銷路大好，每磅批價爲六千元至八千元。</p>
<p>硬鉛　美貨（４X硬鉛）戰後運華數量甚多，嗣美方聞某國以高價吸收，乃即禁止出口，據聞該項硬鉛，內含一部份主要金屬，經煉提後，可供製造軍械器材之用，滬地用度未减少，存底日見短紬，致市價較目前高出一倍。</p>
<h3>精白糖有拋盤成交　每百磅美金十八元七角半</h3>
<p>昨糖市初平後軟，公會劃盤現貨中砂白初劃九萬七千元至六千五百元，六千元，下午五千五百元至四千元，前後小三千元，溫州來中砂白僅九萬元，棧單九萬二千元，至九萬〇五百元，九萬元，四半車白十七萬元，三半車白十四萬七千元，生砂十萬〇二千元至一千元，後爲九萬七千元，小五千元，號貨潮帮開出棉赤十萬〇五千元，黃崗靑八萬元至七萬九千元，成交百數包，建帮開刁靑數十包，七萬九千元，興化赤九萬八千元至六千元，聞秘魯精白糖拋貨已有成交，價爲每百磅美金十八元七角半，外稅，七八九月份裝船。</p>
<h3>金融市場頗平穩</h3>
<p>港票需要昨甚殷　外股多逢高出籠</p>
<p>烚赤　昨仍穩定，交易有限，起仆殊微，長開後始終在一九四萬左右盤旋，十時後中央配出七十條，價一九四萬，此際更爲平定，近午始自一九三萬盤好少許，但亦朱越一九五萬，午後人心尙穩，喊價微高，結果較前收微升五千，飾金念萬〇六，紋銀一千八，銀元一三八〇元有供，暗拆銀根仍鬆，息價在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍吿平和，午前自二五三〇元至二五七〇元，僅有四十元距離，午刻在二五五〇元左右，午後仍乏大變化，金市報高，稍見秀色而已，結果較前收微挫十五元，港票求戶大殷，結果好起十元，受英美借款將由美衆院作最後決定影響，一般套賣英美匯兌，有以致之，港匯五四五元至五五五元，印匯六七〇元有賣，英匯八千七至八千九，美匯仍乏變化。</p>
<p>公債　漸形恍惚，求供飄忽，統丙自晨初九五〇元退至七八〇元，近午在八五〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收讀挫一二〇元，甲乙丁亦跌一四〇元，戊種尙平，僅微挫九十元。</p>
<p>華股　大股依然見秀，小股仍感乏力，市况初堅後平，晨初最俏時永紗五〇五元，美亞三〇五〇元，景福一八〇元，新光二〇〇元，勤興一五五元，中途最疲時永紗四七五元，美亞二七八〇元，景福一六〇元，新光一八〇元，勸興一四〇元，近午徘徊而已，結果較前收永紗美亞仍有微升，景福微降，新光勤興則平，冷門中型微升，小型則以求供不一，升降有限，三老股稍有回上。</p>
<p>外股　略起回跌，持有者逢高出籠，在證交上市股票未規定前，經營外股者不免忐忑也，怡紗自八千四退至七千五，而後轉盤，結果較前收怡紗會德　英聯鋼業跌半成弱，紙業亞洲怡啤跌半成强，業廣平平。</p>

<h3>我國所得到聯總的求濟</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>經過大戰極度的破壞，在戰后，必須要有一番善後的處理，而許多土地荒廢，人民在死亡綫上掙扎，善後的工作尤須有一根本減法。為了展開這善後救濟的工作，四十四個聯合國家，於一九四三年十一月九日簽訂了一個協定，成立聯合國家後救濟總署。</p>
<p>我國支持戰爭的時間最久，所受的毀壞也最重，希望得到救濟也最切。行政院乃租成一個調查設計委員會，在國際專家協助之下，完成了報告，估計我們需要善後救濟共需二十五億美元和具有戰前購買力的法幣二十七億元。但我們向聯總提出的為九億四千五百萬美元，其餘的由中國自籌。</p>

<p>下項物資價值以美元計</p>
<p>此外，并向聯總請派外國專家二千餘人，其中百分之五十五為復興運輸交通和農工業的，百分之四十五則辦理真接的救濟工作。上項數字，祇是我國所需要的百分之三十七，其餘百分之六十三須中國自行籌措。另外，還要籌行政經費二十七億二千七百萬元。中國並在行政院設立善後救濟總畧，簡稱「行總」，「聯總」亦設中國分署，得興行總相合作。</p>
<p>中國向聯總請求救濟的數量，巳經低到最少限度，自信粄為公允，可是聯總考慮分配中國的，並不像理想上的體富。擄行總於冊四年十二月廿六日發表的公開談話，共收到的物資九萬噸，又擄聯總中國分署主任凱沙於冊五年五月十日宣稱，巳串連抵上海之救濟物資有四一三，三九五噸，其他各部一二八，〇〇〇噸，尚有一一九，六七一噸在途中。而擄行總駐美辯事處主任鄭賓南所發表（冊五年一月廿八日於上海）之談話，我國獲得的救濟物資和其他各國比較起來，實在是太少了！（如下表）</p>

<p>中國　五六〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇　一、二五</p>
<p>雖然在絕對數字上看，中國巳不算少，但以中國災區之廣大，難民之眾多，這龐大的數字還覺得不夠，比例太少。</p>
<p>聯總對我國的救濟，尤其使我們所失望的，就是糧食，我國八年抗戰以來，人民生活已經不堪，且卅四卅五兩年秋收減少，號稱產米之湖南，耕地不及三分之一，河南的黃泛區亦無法耕種，其他如桂，鄂，贛的戰區，蘇北，山東，山西，東北等所謂中共解放區，人民均感困苦，面稹少廣包括十八省，亟待救濟者四千萬人。伹因世界各地每發生嚴頂的饑荒，以致分配中國的糧食祇是一個極少的數量。當賑災時使胡佛來華之後，會代向聯總提出，每月連華之救濟品，增加二十萬噸（包括五，六，七，八，九五個月），但聯總方面只允在五個月內運輸八十七萬噸，同時又因我國交能運輸工具的缺乏，海港設僃之不健全，不能把遣救濟物資迅速運到災區去，這也是一件憾事。</p>
<p>行總的原則，預僃在二年內把災區的情形辦好同，同時以善後建設代替救濟，一方面乘機促進工業化。其工作則分辨理急賑，恢復交通，改良農耕，建設醫政，穩定金融。行總對於物品的處理，分免義分配，救濟貧民，平價發售，並將一部分物資售出，以充行政經費。辦慈善事業，本來是不容易的事，蔣署長也一再聲明辦事人員必須廉潔守法，就是這樣，也還要受人指摘的。</p>
<p>聯總署長賴伽第亞於七月九日宣佈農工業設備停止運華，說是由於根據聯總中國分署外籍職員三百餘人之聯名控訴。控訴之點，（一）中國未能將救濟物資，迅速分配給難民，而以作為政治的工具，（二）中國政府不供給行總之經費，致將救濟物資出賣，使無數飢民不能得到需要之糧食，我國政府已於十一日發表聲明，蔣署長則更於十二日招待記者有所解釋。諒聯總署長明瞭中國實情後，必能照常恢復物資運華的工作。</p>
<h3>空軍第八大隊東京行（二）</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>飛機所聯絡的第一個日本境內美軍電台，是福崗，澮電台給了我們憂愁，也給了我們信任。日本境內天氣終歸是好的，不會有什嚒艱苦了，過福崗以后，大家又吃香烟，糖菓，四個女孩子把所帶麵包蛋糕拼命贈客，我又想到真正的作戰場合上，就不能有女隨機員一同去。原因是男子剛強，可以像野獸去奮門。有女人在機內那就會使得男子分心去保護她們，所以倘若飛機去作戰，那這四位女孩子遞糕糖的行為將會引起憎厭，而且會分空勤員的心。可是這次飛行卻不然。我看所有的人都吃了一點巧克力糖，尤其是徐書林，他像一個聯絡員，上上下下，前前後後的管理全飛機，需要不斷的注意，不斷的工作，在他忙碌中贈與糖菓，他在聽懂下，馬上報以微笑與感謝，同時做手勢示意，陳功懋則不同，他需要提神，在耳神經上去搜捕美軍電台的電波，以便得知前程的氣候報告。有時，他要按他發報機樞去刺激美軍電台，所以他眼睛看著的是一圈一圈電波，耳架聽的是一「滴滴答」音號，他貴在什麼都不想吃，只指望能以不失卻聯絡。</p>
<p>大阪過了之後，二點四十分，我們看到富士山，在左凌出現。雲對了下界，但富士山的黑色山體，冒出雲外，山頂卻被白雲敷蓋。看到富士山，距東京厚太機場只在十五分鐘。在未看到富士山之前，王大隊長指揮飛機向右飛，這是他怕靠近他的謹慎　，年歲大點是不同些。二點四十五分，我們到東京灣海上。我們全都愉快的欣喜能按時飛到　了。除了朱團長會到過東京外，機上人都是第一次光臨。駕駛員座上可以像二位坐專車欣賞車窗外風光的主客，從容著一為他下面的東京灣。我們搭飛機的在小小艙內擠坐著，要看東京灣，只有擠到小玻璃旁探視著。徐書林看到前上砲塔坐位空著，他招招他，我爬上去，這是一座向後瞥戒的半圓形玻璃球，我側轉身向前看，東京灣，如想像中的樣子，近似一綫環抱的淺灘，再前去就是陸地。海水還是灰色，平靜無浪，但小嶋　著的清楚，沒有一叟船，也不見船塢　，這是一個純自然區域。就在這裹，日本怖震，設立海岸要塞，終於又自行打開門戶，投降屈服，東京灣就此平靜下來。</p>
<p>我們的飛機順著直綫沖富士山而去，登陸之後，就看到日本山田河流間一塊高的平台地，黃黃的光禿顏色，上面放了許多整齊排列的飛機。我們飛機毫不猶預直驪那機場飛，到達飛機碭，我遠看以為小小的一個機場，近看才知他很寬闊。長方形的場面裏，一條黑色跑道，那四面排列的飛機五光十色不可計數，各種式樣的，應有盡有，這真是軍容的示威。從單發動機的野馬式，變發動機　機身上的P88偵察機，同式的黑色P67黑寡婦夜監機，B25，B24，C54，C46，各式飛機全部有的是。</p>
<h3>小農堡壘逐步建立起來</h3>
<p>飛機落在黑色鐲板跑道上，快到盡頭，有一條滑行道轉向左邊去。一輛小小的吉普車，車背上漆了一塊「請隨我走」的牌子，插一面黃旗「在司機旁」。我們這隻龐大的海鯨，就屈伏在這小吉普車引下，隨他滑行又滑行。我看到滑行道外邊的棚場里，停了許多在修理的飛機，棚楊門口坐著的美國兵把兩手搭在帽沿上，遮住射目的陽光，來觀察這新到的胖小子。美國人生活在衆多的事物中，第天時間精力都花在接受刺激與工作中裏，他們的性格那麼爽直，與生活在活水中獲得新鮮刺激是有很大關系。</p>
<p>我們出了飛機以後，才感覺厚木機場上是熱的。來迎朱世明團長的美國人以及代表團人員紛紛乘車離去了。王大隊長還在等候徐書林收拾飛機，並且協助美軍為飛機加油工作，這飛機裝油量為二千八百加俞。（六十大桶）美國人毫不講究什麼手續，用油車來為飛機裝油，連簽字手續都不要。這是一種么麼氣魄的國家！我想，這只有接觸過的人才會感覺到。</p>
<p>我們在收拾飛機完了之后，就乘轎車兩輛入城，司機是一位穿綠嗶嘰西裝帶柔白帽的中年日本人，名叫金谷孝。他生得一付慈和面孔，說話聲調輕柔，動作也恭敬。他說上次劉上尉也是坐他的車，現巳回到重慶，日本人就是那麼弄不清楚現在中國政府早已遷回南京。上次來的劉善本上尉刻下是回國了，日本人還那麼恭敬的記住這些，總是他們從心理上把中國人放一個相當看重的位置。由這點，我們感覺到東京來，處處會遭受日本人白眼，這雖然是一種過慮。</p>
<p>汽車在厚木駛向東京的公路上行進，這條路兩旁全是農田村舍，人烟稠密，徐書林跟黃爾毅說：這簡直是四川成都鄕下風景，田裏的耕作，如中國一樣，用人手一塊一塊的植些芋，稻，麥。這時巳近旁晚，田間日本女人以及小孩在掘泥或除草。在公路上，日本男人推小板車運送一點木料，在灰塵中流汗行進。田間除了植食料之外，荒地總是茂密的長滿松林，木板屋以及小平屋傍依林地，那風光並不能看出這地方愛過戰爭，尤其在小河流附近，看到日本小孩在水中嬉戲，老人在垂竿釣魚，這光景叫我從中國來的人羨慕而難受。日本打敗了，他的人民却解除了流血的任務，可以去為衣食住的向上向善而努力。我們打勝了，我們的人民却仍在穿了軍衣開槍，或是流離失所。</p>
<p>我們由厚木到東京的路上，所見全是國泰民安現象。日本鄕下很少看到戰爭痕跡。大槪最顯著的是男人少了，因為從瓜逹康納島以迄琉球島的戰爭中，日本鄕下出去當兵的死了很多，而日本各大都市被炸時，死的壯丁也很多，可是日本人旣巳生活安定，死的也死了，活的自然得忙著吃住得好點。盟國對日本經濟政策打擊了日本金融資本勢力對農村的控制與吸血，日本鄕村消失了大吸血虫所加的損害，一種安定的富裕的小農堡壘會逐一建立並充實，那風景是更可觀的。</p>

<h3>蘇北難胞要求還鄕</h3>
<p>日前湯副總司令蒞揭，對難胞訓話，有決定送你們還鄕稍安毋躁等語。（其時在停戰十五日期內）前月二十九日徐州薛主任，在歡迎谷部長會上，指示各縣黨政首長，囑自即日起，將難民組機起來，準備隨時還鄕等語。刻停戰期滿，交逾敗日，未見有若何勳應。而共黨代表周恩來之宣言，對於我政府提出條件，旣曰尚不以此為滿足，又曰無理要求，其驕傲態度，令人慶指，更明白否認共軍有撤出蘇北之視，表示對於撤出蘇北熱河等地軍隊及政權，寶無法考慮與接受。這樣堅決拒絕的語調意圖久佔蘇北。其無敞意謀和，巳昭然若揭。惟國計民生不容再拖，此為全國人士所公認。政府果有拯數難胞之決心，睹此水深火熱之慘境，當有緊急之處置。經政府寶踐送我們還鄕之諾言，以保威信，而慰民望。（流亡揚州各縣難民代裏戚澄鄭毅齊淑鄕覲銘新）</p>

<h3>白衣天使</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>好像從那時起，我和梅琪通了幾封信。但可說完全是一種「玩」的意思，祗當他是一個小孩子，同他開玩笑而已。我也曾送過一張照片給他，但也不過是玩玩，決非要給他留着作什麽紀念。</p>
<p>後來，因為西光中學有一班較大較壞的學生在外面造我謠言，我也就不再去和梅琪開玩笑了。</p>
<p>之後，大約過了三四年，我已離開學校。又一次遇到一個和梅琪同鄉的老同學，她告訴我梅琪因父母雙亡，早不在讀書，在一家醫院裏學化驗師了。他又說那孩子依舊油滑得很，在醫院裏追求一個年紀比他大二三歲的護士，名叫徐湘英，二人已快要訂婚了。</p>
<p>聽了那同學報告的消息，我淡然一笑，不久就忘了。</p>
<p>直到戰事爆發後幾年，我才又約略聽到一些梅琪的消息，知道他已跟人到內地去讀書，他的未婚妻徐湘英沒有去，在北平某大醫院做護士，風頭甚健等等。</p>
<p>想到這裏，望着那本紀念冊，我幾乎笑了出來。</p>
<p>什麽都清明雪亮了：她是徐湘英。她在梅琪的破箱舊籠中發現過我的照片，看見過我的名字，就此牢紀在心，以為我是梅琪的什麽舊情人了。</p>
<p>關上插燈，我在朦朧的月色中透了一口長長的氣，默默地思想着第二天該如何向徐湘英解釋這誤會。</p>
<p>可是等到第二天下午，徐湘英還是沒有到我房裏來。向人打聽一下，才知道她是新任的夜班護士長，白天睡覺，要到晚上才起身上班。於是我急巴巴地等到了晚上。果然，夜深人靜之後，她又來了。然而她沒有等我向她解釋，僅向我神秘又可怕地一笑，問了聲：「你好嗎？」便在我枕邊取回了那本紀念冊，悄悄地向外走了。</p>
<p>此後，她幾乎夜夜如此，不給我一點解釋的機會，僅向我神秘又可怕地一笑，就去了。</p>
<p>「女人的心腸竟如此狹窄嗎？」我幾乎忘掉自己是女人，我開始有些憤然了。</p>
<p>然而就在那時候，從一些年輕的護士學生口中，飛飛揚揚傳來許多閑話。說什麽徐湘英每天要寄一封航空快信去給她未婚夫呀；每個月領着的薪水，三分之二要匯去給她未婚夫作學費呀；甯可不睡覺，日夜替她未婚夫趕做絨綫衫呀！……</p>
<p>當然閑話不一定可靠。但因着那些閑話，我對徐湘英那種神秘可怕的冷態，似乎略為有了一點諒解。我明白：一個女人的愛越狂熱，嫉妒和猜疑也越厲害。那是沒有辦法的事。</p>
<p>「不必解釋了，隨她去吧！」找不到機會，最後我也就淡然一笑，不再去注意她了。</p>
<p>但我自己都記不清過了多少日子。總之，好像是冬天，聖誕節快來臨的時候，一個靜悄悄的晚上，徐湘英開過盲腸炎，睡在我對面的病床上，輕輕叫了我一聲，向我道：</p>
<p>「你懂得我這次開刀，爲什麽特意要睡在你房裏嗎？我是要找個機會同你談談，因為我就要走了！」</p>
<p>「你要到內地去？」記起了她第一晚告訴我的話，我倒並不驚奇。</p>
<p>「是的，到內地去。但我是有慢性盲腸炎的，怕路上辛苦時要發作，所以預先開掉了她。同時，也可乘此機會和你談談。……」她沒有說下去，倒頭望着我，眼光是柔和的，但在柔和中露着猜疑和痛苦。我知道這機會是不應該放過的了。便起來輕輕走到她床前，很胆白很簡單地，把梅琪和我的關係告訴了她。</p>
<p>我知道她相信我不曾騙她，因為聽完之後，她點點頭，伸過一隻手來握住了我。可是突然之間，我發現她眼角掛着二滴淚珠，她在哭！</p>
<p>也許眼淚是世界上最無用的東西。但眼淚也偶而能像一陣急驟的雨，把人與人中間的隔閡沖散開去。她哭了，然而她眼睛裏那點神秘和可怕的東西也消失了。</p>
<p>「我相信你。但我不敢相信梅琪，有人說他在內地另外有了……」揩乾眼淚後，她望着我，說了半句話。聲音是真摯的，眼光也是真摯的。</p>
<p>我們就這樣相互地諒解了。在短短的二星期中，我對徐湘英有了許多認識。我覺得她雖然是一位新式的摩登小姐，性格倒很像古代的貞女烈婦。她的愛是專一的，不變的。她給我看幾封信，是北平有一個青年醫生寫給她的，詞句非常誠懇動人。然而她對我淒然一笑說：「我已愛了梅琪，任何男人也打不動我的心了！」我又覺得她對梅琪的愛，而是一種近乎母性的慈愛了。她把梅琪當作兒子一樣，憐惜他，照顧他，明知他有些油滑不可靠，但並不怪他，却說：「一定有什麽壞女人在引誘他，所以我無論如何要趕去看看他！」聽了這話，我心裏感動而又難堪。</p>
<p>聖誕節來臨的時候，徐湘英的肚皮上拆了綫，已能起床走走了。於是她打算一開陽曆年就動身到內地去。但那時梅琪來了一封信，大約說起需要兩身襯衣，而內地的布很貴等等。她就大忙而特忙起來了。</p>
<p>下過雪，天冷得要命，而她肚皮上的傷口尚未完全平復。可是連着後幾夜，我從夢中醒來，看見她還坐在床上，披着一件白色的銀鼠大衣，垂着頭，在替她的愛人縫製襯衣。於是我記起她紀念冊上的那幅畫，在淡綠色的燈光下，我仿佛看見一個穿白衣的天使，站在雲端，展開雙臂俯視着大地。</p>
<p>我記得，那是一九四〇年的一月二十日，她去了，她去的時候，她叫我在她的紀念冊上寫幾個字，以留紀念。我就寫了這麼二句：</p>
<p>「我的朋友，</p>
<p>我最敬佩的白衣天使，</p>
<p>願你幸福！」</p>
<p>她去了。在艱苦的旅程中，她還忘不了我，寄過二封信來。可是這二封信以後，她就一直沒有寄信了。因不知道她的地址，我也沒有方法寄信去。當然她的消息，我仍能飛飛揚揚聽到一些的，有的說她已結婚，有的說她在生肺病，有的說她出家當尼姑去了。似乎所有的消息都不可靠，因此我都不敢相信。</p>
<p>然而可靠的消息終於來了。去年冬天，一位從內地出來的朋友來看我，向我道：「你知道嗎？梅琪的未婚妻徐湘英自殺了！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽自殺？」我嚇得渾身直抖。</p>
<p>「當然為梅琪！」那朋友靜靜地回答我，「那小滑頭本來不是真心愛她，最近大學畢業了，不需要她的錢了，於是，就把她拋棄了！」</p>
<p>那一天是陰曆冬至節。聽到這消息，我感到說不出的悲憤和難受。恰正我的同病朋友麗珊和她新結交的男友陸君來了，我就把這件事告訴他們。麗珊聽了，平淡地一笑道：「徐湘英自己太傻！我說這樣的女人，自作自受，應該死！你說對嗎？」</p>
<p>對嗎？……我知道也許是對的！然而我沒有回答麗珊，祗悄悄地立起來走到窗口，向着浩闊的天空，默默的喊了聲：</p>
<p>「我的朋友，</p>
<p>我最敬佩的白衣天使，</p>
<p>願你永遠安息吧！」（續完）</p>
<h3>靜</h3>
<p>— 藍戈</p>
<p>靜，有它不可言喻的深奧的意義。</p>
<p>小溪裏潺緩的流水；天空裏變幻的雲彩；松林裏的一陣清風；田野裏的一聲犬吠；花間的一隻蜜蜂；清晨的一聲雞啼；暮色裏的一聲鴉鳴；古刹裏的一聲磬；以及月光下的一排樹影……這些都是配成靜的條件。</p>
<p>因為，沒有鬧就沒有靜，所以靜是由空漠的甯定裏的微變而產生。它給人以超然的意象和過敏的感覺。</p>
<p>當夜色降臨於大地的時候，靜把大地所有的鬧吸收盡了。那時荒野裏的一聲犬吠是靜的，林間的一聲鴟鳴是靜的。靜把周圍的空氣變得輕鬆，却也把空氣變得緊張。在靜的輕鬆裏，我們會把心靈的煩惱全部交給落漠而甯靜的空氣；我們會在現實的顛沛裏想到一些以往的美夢和未來的渺茫的希望。那時我們是愉快的，是輕鬆的。但是在靜的緊張裏，我們却像把自己的心靈跌入了黑暗的深淵裏，一切都是堅苦和恐怖，忘記了以往的美夢，也想不到未來的燦爛的希望，只是面臨着恐怖的現實發着震驚和失望的顫抖。</p>
<p>我們更會在靜的空氣裏暗暗地探索自己以往的行為，讓自己冷靜下來的心靈得到一點慰藉的鼓勵和罪愆的懺悔。因為唯有靜才是一面使自己能清晰地反顧過去的最好的明鏡；所謂「半夜思過」也正是配合着靜而說的。</p>
<p>柴霍夫說過：「我們應當等自己冷靜下來時方可下筆！」靜實在也是使我們的情感澄清，理智正確的最好的濾水器。在沒有一刻清靜的時間來讓他們細細地沉思一番的人們，他們的情感是危險的——他們的筆也是危險的。</p>
<p>在現實的煩囂裏生活的人們，你們可以清靜一下了。整個的時代綏動盪和煩擾，但是總有一處地方和一刻時光能讓你們清靜地思索一下，和忠實地檢討一下的。我們知道，沒有冷靜的理智的心靈是建立不起清靜的世界的！</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　八三</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>旅長乾爸爸是一家飯館子的老主顧，他便常常把麗華帶到這家飯館子裏來。平時也不斷送酒席到麗華住的地方去請她。旅長乾爸爸留着一撮東洋鬍，生得高大肥胖，麗華在他的面前，宛如雛雞在老虎的面前。因此麗華一看見他，便像耗子看見貓一樣地害怕，但又不能不捏着鼻子敷衍他。</p>
<p>有一天旅長乾爸爸請麗華吃晚飯，說吃了晚飯再送她到戲園子去。一向麗華無論到哪兒去，都是墨太太陪她一道，這一次旅長乾爸爸不讓墨太太一道，墨太太因為覺得是跟乾爸爸在一起，也就很放心地沒有配麗華去。於是麗華越發地怕起來了。到飯館子裏，旅長乾爸爸早預備好一個漂亮的單房間，沒有別的客人，只麗華自己。這時，麗華開始咕咕了，但又不能馬上就走。旅長乾爸爸要了許多酒菜，殷勤地照拂着麗華，可是麗華一點也吃不下去。</p>
<p>「麗華，乾爸爸真喜歡你，趕明兒你就跟乾爸爸，好不好？」旅長乾爸爸邊喝着酒，邊笑向麗華說。</p>
<p>「不像話！」麗華心裏說，他明白這個「跟」字不是好意。但嘴裏並不言語，只笑了笑。</p>
<p>「說，說呀！說你願不願意跟乾爸？」紳士乾爸爸逼緊了問。</p>
<p>「不！」麗華搖搖頭說。「我要跟媽在一起！」麗華猝然之間，想不出適當的回答來。</p>

<h3>誠</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「大詐似信，大奸似忠，外示朴野，中藏巧詐；驕蹇慢上，陰賊害物。」</p>
<p>讀宋史讀到呂誨上疏彈劾王安石的上面幾句時，便發生不少感想，第一，王安石當時炙手可熱，深獲神宗寵信，一名小諫官，竟有這樣的胆氣；第二，詐信，奸忠，朴野，巧詐，這一套邏輯，非毫無根據之談，確有至理；第三，人的主張，或者說政見，是是非非，往往不易被理解，而「非」似乎亦有其「理論基礎」。</p>
<p>以王安石而論，他確是個政治改造家，並不是極端的壞人，他的變政，比如青苗錢法，未始不想福國利民，至於是非功罪，千秋萬世，自有定論，且不去談它。</p>
<p>政治家的條件，其實一個誠字很要緊，惟有誠才能取信。今人好談手腕，講求拔衛，往往作繭自縛。</p>
<p>當前社會風氣，可說爾詐我虞，無一不在用欺騙，這種現象比任何危險還要危險。人與人之間如果終日鈎心鬥角，不能互信，那還成一個怎樣的世界。</p>
<p>不僅此也，社會還在獎勵着欺詐，於是好人，老實人，逐漸的少，而有「噱頭」的朋友，日見其多，真令人痛心！</p>
<p>溽暑悶人，讀宋史有感，胡扯數行，明知語無倫次，不計也，亦難計也。</p>
<h3>當心黑眼鏡！</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>夏天到了，黑眼鏡又流行了，而且今年，更是「美式配備」，時髦加時髦，真是「頂好，頂好」。何况，所謂摩登人物，連冬天，也戴黑眼鏡的。</p>
<p>不過，時髦是一件事，健康又是一件事；也許摩登男女，寗肯為追逐時髦，而犧牲健康；但是，凡有理智的人，不能不慎重些，多一分思索。願大家一讀，喬治，奇士哥教授登在「衛生雜誌」上的文章：「當心黑眼鏡！」</p>
<p>美國每年賣掉的黑眼鏡，約達兩千萬副，當然，大家競購黑眼鏡是為了眼睛的舒適和保護目光。但是，美國患眼炎，眼腫，眼爛的人，却每年夏季都有增加，其中有許多人，眼睛中發現了盲點。有一位著名的眼科專家說：「戴黑眼鏡能增加眼睛的舒適，是靠不住的。至於保護目光，在多數情形中，也並無其事」。</p>
<p>陽光的輻射，是由數種不同的光線構成的，除了看得見的光線之外，還有看不見的紫外光和紅外光（熱光）。廉價的黑眼鏡，正如薰過的，或着色的鏡片一樣，能够減輕閃爍的陽光，但是，它並不能够把太陽中看不見的，有傷目力的光線全部吸收。</p>
<p>在正常的情形下，眼瞳收縮到足能够容納充份的光線，在眼球後面的綱膜上，產生一個清晰的影像。但是，黑眼鏡減弱了太陽中能够看見的光線，結果使眼瞳放大，暴露了眼睛中敏感的內部。</p>
<p>眼睛天然能够適應少量的紫外光和紅外光，甚至有的眼科專家認為，少量的紫外光及紅外光對眼睛是有益的，不過，太多的紫外光，足致眼結膜炎，有一些較長的紫外光，從眼角膜，射入眼球中的水晶　，產生螢光，損傷了正常的視力。</p>
<p>紅外光為　更大！如果你直　太陽，然後低下頭，你會看見一個黑點，就是閉上了眼睛，也還能够看見到這個黑點。這是太陽的殘影，紅外光使眼角膜受到微傷。稍待一會兒，黑點就消失了。假使，你向太陽望得太久——即使戴着黑眼鏡——固執的黑點，可能永久地損傷了你的視力。雖然有黑眼鏡，眼睛的內膜，已被紅外光燒成一個黑斑。</p>
<p>即使是普通的無色鏡片，也能够吸收少量的紫外光，所以，任何黑眼鏡能够部份地抵禦紫外光的輻射。不過，醫師警告大家，一般廉價的黑眼鏡，並不能充份地保護目光，它們是靠不住的。這些劣貨的黑眼鏡，都是普通鏡片，用幾種金屬氣化物着色的。</p>
<p>紐約大學的眼科教授湯博士說：「站在科學的立塲上講，最好的黑眼鏡，能够吸收紫外光及紅外光，並能平均地吸收一部份太陽中的七種光線」。</p>
<p>好的黑眼鏡是由磨　過的鏡片製成的。能够吸收紫外光及紅外光，將看得見的光線減低到舒適的限度。</p>
<p>關於太陽眼鏡的顏色，有人主張綠色，有人主張綠黃，因為它們都不致引起顏色的錯覺。在駕車時，這點更為重要，有些顏色，如深琥珀色，往往使戴黑眼鏡的人分辨不出紅綠燈，那可要闖禍了。</p>
<p>湯博士把美國眼科專家代表，對黑眼鏡的意見，做了一個結論。他們都主張，必須磨琢過的黑眼鏡，而且只能在強烈的太陽光下戴。有百分之五十的專家，認為不在強烈陽光下戴黑眼鏡，是有　的。</p>
<h3>我愛醫生</h3>
<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>——讀「我怕醫院」後</p>
<p>九日在「自由談」中有「我怕醫生」一文，讀後內心湧起了很多的思潮，很想能「自由」的談一談。</p>
<p>「醫學的職務在替人類服務，別種職業也是為社會服務的，農夫供給食料，商人販買用品，律師保障人權，都是為人類盡力，但是醫生的職業，不僅在滿足社會上需要的一項或一點，他是關心着整個的人生的幸福，無論那一種疾病都危害到生命，一個小瘡能致人於死，每一種病都足以引起危險，而醫生就是救護者；所以他職務的重要，僅有另一種人類的扶助者——牧師，可以互相比擬。醫生與牧師是同出一源的。」這是美國Sigerist博士所說的一段話。我的思想完全與他一致。</p>
<p>醫學的記號是一個顯紅的十字，醫院裏白底紅色的十字到處可見；由於思想的連擊，使人追憶着基督教中的十字架，在信仰自由的旌旗下，做醫生的人，縱然不信奉基督，但至少該有基督偉大的精神，去醫治病人；因為醫學也是一個十字架，——博愛犧牲憐憫。醫生的目的，不應該是金錢，否則他不能算好醫生。他只是個懂得醫學的「商人」。商人的心目中只有金錢是他的對象，但醫生的對象決不是這些，只有「生命」是醫生的要求。</p>
<p>商人把零貨售於他人或者囤積不賣。雖然能使人受得損失，總比較有限。也許也可以設法補救。惟有在醫學上，細微的錯誤，竟會斷送了病人的「生命」，而且絕對無法加以補救的。法院的判決或有反訴的餘地，但因醫生的失職所種下的災禍，是無法抑制的。醫學直接影響個人的健康和生命，間接却有關於社會，國家以及整個人類的幸福。由此可見醫生的責任與使命，如果今天所有的醫生都退出人羣，讓疾病來摧殘來毀滅人類，請問，這個世界的人將遭遇何種命運？</p>
<p>為什麼有人要說：「人怕醫生」？醫生是人所該怕的嗎？不，決不；這裏我得對「醫生」的定義，加以說明。在中國，有很多人自稱是「醫生」，別人也稱他為「醫生」的人，可是壓根兒他沒有受過相當醫學的教育和訓練。同時他之所以做「醫生」，也像做別種職業一樣，目的為了自己的生活。中國的醫生在社會上的地位，所以沒有達理論上的高，就是因為醫生本身學識與道德（醫德）之不足所致。所以醫生非但沒有救人而且殺人。這種醫生（注意他不是理想的醫生）當然要被人「怕」了，所以醫生要一面充實自己的學識，一面也要注意醫德！</p>
<p>疾病摧殘人類的本身，把他們天賦的幸福和快樂奪了去，疾病破壞了生活正常的音律，由於衛生設備的缺少，醫生的缺乏，民衆知識之幼稚，每年枉死的人不知幾何？許多窮鄉僻壤，固然找不到「郎中」，而在村鎮裏的「醫生」也是寥寥無幾，即使大都市，也因為社會制度之不良，經濟之拮据，有些窮人一旦生病也一樣沒有錢去醫病，而讓病魔來作最後的決定。</p>
<p>總之醫學的改進是中國當前的急務，要有強健的國家，必先有強健的人民，敢問一個深博學識高尚品格却沒有健全體格的人，是否有利於國家民族？這樣說來，醫學的重要是不言而喻了。</p>
<p>我們希望社會制度能改良，使每人不因經濟條件不足而失去醫治的機會，同時也願做醫生的人，真正為病家服務！</p>
<p>最後，我說：「我愛醫生」！</p>
<h3>「三洋勿揩」</h3>
<p>— 文漪</p>
<p>前天傍晚筆者為了有些公事，搭上舊英租界一路有軌電車。因為當時乘客甚稀，賣票的得空便和其中幾個搭訕起來，漸漸談到電車售票者之揩油，那個賣票對於這件事似乎感到十分得意，最後有一個乘客問他遇到那種乘客則不揩其油。</p>
<p>『哈哈！咱們抱「三洋勿揩」主義！』賣票的笑着說。</p>
<p>的確！這名詞太新奇了，當時我因好奇心切，便請教其所以然，就是問他何謂「三洋勿揩主義！」</p>
<p>『第一，洋裝者勿揩，因為穿西裝的人，在我們面前雖不發一語，但查票來時，往往搬弄是非，小則責備扣薪，大則打碎飯碗。為謹慎起見，我們認為穿洋裝者不可揩。第二，洋人勿揩，因為若揩了洋人的油，當面呵叱尚算從輕發落，利害的抄號碼，報公司，飯碗打碎是必然的。所以我們對洋人亦分文不揩。第三，洋盤（俗語阿木林）勿揩，因為有一天我們的一個同事揩了一個洋盤的油，囑那洋盤說：「查票來時，你說跑馬廳上來的好了。」恰巧到了跑馬廳，上來一個查票，向他要票子的時候問他：「從那兒上來的？」「跑馬廳。」「上來多少時候了？」「很久了。」當時查票發覺言語不符，揩油是實，於是將賣票的記大過一次。所以洋盤勿揩，以免弄巧成拙！』</p>
<p>賣票員的一席暢談，引得我也嗤然一笑，因為這是一個令人啼笑皆非的事。</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（五）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>足足忙亂了一點多鐘，謝天謝地，仗着吳醫師的強心針和鹽水針，總算把你救回來了；我曾見你張過一張眼，也曾聽得你開過一開口，可是舌子是木強的，聽不清你說些甚麼；隨後就像入睡一般睡過去了。吳醫師見已沒有他的事，興辭而去，答允明天早上七八點鐘再來，小青兄安慰了我一下，也回去了。我還是不大放心，坐在牀邊的靠椅裏陪伴着你，打發　兒熙甥仍去睡覺，而葆妹和葉媽吃了這一驚，早把睡魔嚇退，便也和我一塊兒伴夜。</p>
<p>到得天色大明，鳥聲噪　了園子的時候，而你却仍然昏沈地睡過去，老是微微打鼾，沒有醒回來；我們六隻眼睛，齊注在你那蒼白的臉上，焦急得甚麼似的。捱過了八點鐘，還不見吳醫師光臨，忙喚世京前去促駕，直到九點多鐘，纔見吳醫師怱怱趕來，把量熱表插在你的腋下，據說體溫正常；再聽你的心臟，據說心臟也保持正常；再按你的脈，據說脈搏也比昨晚跳得慢了。那麼你為甚麼老是昏迷不醒呢？難道肺部的病　已達到了腦部麼？我把這可怕的揣測說了出來，吳醫師說這是可能的，不過一到了這地步，也就沒有救了。到得他留下了一張預先開就的藥方走了之後，我們重又掉入了失望之淵；我強瞪着疲倦的眼睛望着你，期待你豁然而醒，可是一二個鐘點很快的滑過了，你仍然鼾聲微微，似乎睡得很甜。我在無可奈何中，寫了一封信給鄉前輩鄒荊　老先生。　述昨夜的經過，請他代打一個長途電話到上海去把錚兒玲兒兄妹倆召回來，立刻喚世京送往馬醫科鄒公館去，一面把藥方交給他，向觀前藥房中配了藥帶回來。為鄭重起見，又喚熙甥上電報局去，打了個急電給錚兒，說是『母危，立即偕玲返蘇！』</p>
<p>天時也像人事一樣的不測，忽的刮起大風來了，中午我像吞鉛彈似的勉強吃下了半碗飯；葆妹和葉媽一夜沒腫，都休息去了，我獨個兒在房中伴着你，站在窗前聽着風聲，它刮着那高高的梧桐樹，刮着那密密的竹林，彷彿萬馬奔騰似的，聽得驚心動魄，我擡頭望着天空，默默的替你祈禱，指望大風把我的禱詞吹上天去，給上帝聽得；指望大風吹進窗來，吹到你的牀上，把你吹醒。</p>
<p>風像瘋狂自管刮着，刮着，我的心煩躁極了，便像發瘋般奔到園子裏去，只見陽光普照，四下無人，除了獅吼似的風聲外，也沒有一些聲息。我莫名所以的繞了個圈兒，重又回到你的牀邊來；却見你還是僵臥不動，並沒有蘇醒的樣子，任我連連的喚着你的名兒，你却老是給我一個不瞅不睬。壁角裏那座落地大鐘鏜鏜的打了三下，難為那位古道熱腸的鄒荊老，以七十四歲的高年，冒着大風趕來了。他老人家緊握着我的手，安慰了我幾句，走到牀邊來瞧你，隨即黯然的向我說道：『嫂夫人似乎已在彌留狀態，你得勉抑悲懷，給她準備準備纔是。』我只有掉淚哽咽的分兒，再也回不出一句話來；當下由他老人家和葆妹倆商量壽衣壽器等事，一會兒已有條有理的決定下來，就自告奮勇的替我辦備去了。你可知道這時我的心中是何等的難受，好像自己已被判了死刑，只索呆坐在牀邊，呆呆的瞧着你，聽你的鼾聲和那重濁的鐘擺聲互相應和着。</p>

<h3>Mediation of the Central Plains War - Marshall Has Conveyed Opinions to the Chairman - Carried by the Group Personnel to the Hankou Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th Dispatch] The 9th and 32nd Executive Groups, brought by Marshall's special plane, flew back to Hankou yesterday afternoon with mediation opinions compromised by both sides. After arriving in Hankou, the Wuhan Headquarters will decide.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The reporter drove to the lakeside of Weiming Lake in the western suburbs yesterday to interview the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart. At that time, Dr. Stuart was meeting with the faculty and staff of Yanjing University and made time for a brief two-minute conversation with the reporter. Stuart said: "I originally didn't like being an official, but the urgent situation in China and the difficulties of Marshall's work make it necessary for me to contribute my efforts. Although President Truman has submitted this new appointment to Congress, it will take about one or two weeks for Congress to pass it and complete the necessary procedures. I will go to Nanjing on Saturday or Sunday as a private citizen to assist Marshall in his work and prepare everything. The reporter asked how he would promote Sino-U.S. relations in the future? Stuart replied: "The method will be changed, but the goal is unchanged." A reporter asked: "What is the future of the KMT-CPC negotiations?" He replied: "I hope to establish a coalition government as soon as possible, which is what Marshall has been hoping for for a long time." The reporter asked: "How should Sino-U.S. economic relations be promoted without destroying China's national industry and the commercial interests of the United States?" He humbly said: "I am a layman, but I must carefully study this issue." The reporter asked: "Is Marshall going to return to the United States recently? And when will Wedemeyer come?" He replied that he did not know. He finally said that he hopes for a peaceful, democratic, and unified China, developed transportation, developed industry, and improved people's living standards. He is 71 years old this year, with thick eyebrows like snow, no teeth left, and a body that is slightly thinner and smaller than the average Westerner, and he is very energetic. During Stuart's term as ambassador, Yanjing University will organize a temporary committee to handle school affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] According to the "World Daily" today: The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, had a separate interview with the newspaper's reporter and said: "The current stalemate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is due to the complete lack of mutual trust between the two sides. The current task is to completely stop military action. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to seek the establishment of a unified coalition government. I do not believe that the Chinese issue can be resolved by war. I hope that the Communist Party can pay attention to the interests of all the Chinese people. I sincerely admire Chairman Chiang's tolerance and generosity. The only policy of the United States toward China is unity, democracy, and peace."</p>
<p>Departure to Beijing Postponed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] Dr. Stuart was originally scheduled to go to Beijing on the 13th, but he could not leave Beiping earlier because the end of Yanjing University's school affairs would take time, and it has been decided to postpone it temporarily.

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th United Press] The New York Times editorial praised Stuart's mission to China. It stated: This commendable and appropriate candidate should be quickly confirmed and start working.</p>

We believe that under the joint efforts of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, all parties will be moved to move towards peace.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-fu Received Reporters Yesterday and Explained the Work of "CNRRA"</h3>
<p>He Responded One by One to the Accusations of UNRRA Staff Members Regarding Various Points. The LaGuardia Measures Were Not Consulted with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, November 11, United Press] According to government officials, LaGuardia's decision to suspend all UNRRA materials to China except for urgently needed food should not be regarded as reflecting the opinion of the U.S. government. He did not even consult with the government before issuing the order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, November 12] UNRRA officials stationed in Shanghai telegraphed UNRRA Director LaGuardia, protesting reports in several New York afternoon newspapers that the Chinese government was misusing UNRRA supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chiang Ting-fu, Director of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), received Chinese and foreign reporters in the city yesterday. The number of attendees was unprecedented in recent reporter receptions. Mr. Chiang immediately issued a written statement explaining the UNRRA Director's announcement of the suspension of material transportation to China and answered various questions raised by the reporters. (Photo: Chiang Ting-fu)</p>
<p>Opinions of UNRRA Staff Members are Indeed Worth Valuing</p>
<p>Regarding the joint telegram sent by UNRRA staff members in Shanghai to the UNRRA Director, Mr. Chiang said: "Although some of the signatories have only been in China for a short time and are not very familiar with the progress of CNRRA's operations in various regions, I believe that the opinions of my UNRRA colleagues are still worth valuing. We wholeheartedly welcome criticisms from the outside world regarding CNRRA, as long as they are based on a clear understanding of the situation and are constructive."</p>
<p>The main points of the telegram are: (1) After UNRRA materials arrive in China, they are not quickly transferred to the areas with the greatest need, resulting in a large amount of materials being stockpiled at the Shanghai docks; (2) Materials are being used as political tools, with political discrimination in distribution, which is inconsistent with the principle of treating everyone equally. Mr. Chiang said: If the friendly relationship between China and the 47 friendly countries that donated materials to China is damaged because of this, it would be the greatest misfortune. However, "the main facts cited are based on misunderstandings and fail to consider the special difficulties encountered in implementing the post-war relief and rehabilitation plan in China after eight years of trauma."</p>
<p>Most of the Materials Shipped by UNRRA Have Already Been Transported Inland</p>
<p>Regarding the point that materials have not been quickly transferred, Mr. Chiang explained: (1) China's situation is very different from that of European countries. All transportation systems were almost completely destroyed after the war. During the first half of the year, CNRRA's work was hampered by particularly low river water levels, which made navigation difficult. Furthermore, at the beginning of this year, the tonnage of river transport vessels was less than half of what it was before the war, so it was inevitable that materials would be slightly delayed. However, as of July 3 of this year, out of the 559,040 tons of materials unloaded by UNRRA, CNRRA had already transported 481,140 tons inland. In the three months of April, May, and June, the amount of materials transported inland by CNRRA exceeded the amount imported by UNRRA into Shanghai in each of those months. For example, in April, 80,099 tons were imported and 103,248 tons were transported inland; in May, 108,598 tons were imported and 150,518 tons were transported inland; in June, 63,010 tons were imported and 78,631 tons were transported inland. (2) Currently, there are 79,000 tons of materials still stored at the port docks. After the sudden end of the Pacific War, in the first three months, there were 16 ocean-going vessels that were originally heading to other countries but were rerouted to China in international waters. The materials they carried were all purchased by UNRRA to provide the most rapid relief to China. UNRRA's good intentions are admirable, but in fact, the cargo manifests of each vessel were extremely incomplete. "The names of items were also wrongly added to many crates, and thousands of crates had to be opened before the contents could be determined." These materials were all purchased on an as-is basis, so "there were many items that China needed, but were not within the UNRRA plan, and may not be useful in China, or although useful, could only be used after domestic transportation was restored." This led to "difficulties in carrying out systematic receiving and processing in the dock warehouses." (3) UNRRA has not completely handed over all the materials currently stored in the warehouses, and CNRRA has not completely received them. (4) Among the surplus U.S. military materials shipped by UNRRA, "there are some damaged and old items, and not all of them can be used immediately, so the problem of receiving and handling is even more difficult." (5) Some materials must remain in Shanghai for assembly and modification, such as trucks that need to be assembled, medical equipment that needs to be boxed, wheat that needs to be ground into flour, and canned food that needs to be inspected (Mr. Chiang pointed out that there were 5,000 tons of canned food in the warehouse, all of which were surplus U.S. military materials, and many were rotten when delivered).</p>
<p>It is Not Easy to Carry Out Relief in Areas Controlled by the Communist Army</p>
<p>Regarding the second point pointed out by UNRRA staff members, the so-called political discrimination issue, Mr. Chiang emphasized two points: (1) "I am the officially appointed representative of the National Government to attend all UNRRA General Assembly meetings. I personally participated in drafting the UNRRA General Assembly resolutions and attach great importance to the spirit and principles of the General Assembly resolutions. I hereby inform you that this office has constantly strived to find ways to transport a reasonable amount of materials into the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. It would be a great misunderstanding to say that the materials transported by this office into the areas controlled by the Chinese Communist Party are less than 2% of the materials delivered by UNRRA to China, because some types of UNRRA materials, such as locomotives, railway equipment, ships, and river defense equipment, are never allocated to the people by this office. Even trucks are never allocated to any area by this office, but are used to transport materials to various places as needed to help the disaster victims." (2) Eighty percent of the materials shipped to China by UNRRA are food, and most of the areas controlled by the Communist Army are grain-producing areas. CNRRA's distribution of materials must be based on the needs of each area.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang said: It is indeed quite difficult to carry out relief in the communist-controlled areas, but "CNRRA" still follows the instructions of Chairman Chiang and President Song, and his own orders, without avoiding difficulties, to transport a fair amount of materials to those areas. Recently, "CNRRA" has also established two offices in Yantai and Heze in the communist-controlled areas of Shandong Province to specifically handle relief matters in that area. Due to his duties, Mr. Chiang has often maintained contact with Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Dong Biwu, and they "have never protested to me or expressed any dissatisfaction regarding distribution issues." CNRRA is transparent in everything it does, and Mr. Chiang "is confident that the UNRRA Director will resume transportation to China after reviewing the actual situation of the work in China," and "CNRRA will be able to carry through to the end and achieve valuable success."</p>
<p>If Material Transportation is Suspended for Too Long, the Revival Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang then answered questions from the reporters, saying: (1) The improvement of "CNRRA's" distribution system is the responsibility of the CNRRA's executive director; (2) The main reason for "UNRRA's" decision this time is the accumulation of materials in the warehouses, which has led to poor transportation, and it is not intended to reduce China's benefits. China's greatest needs are food and rehabilitation equipment. Currently, food is still being supplied as usual, but if the transportation of other materials is suspended for too long, the revival will inevitably be affected; (3) The policy-making bodies of "UNRRA" are the General Assembly and the Central Authority, in which China has representatives. The "UNRRA" Director's action this time was not approved by these two bodies. China has now made representations to the "UNRRA" Director, because this action is an administrative issue rather than a policy issue, so it cannot be submitted to the General Assembly; (4) Of "CNRRA's" expenses, administrative expenses are paid by the Chinese government, and half of the operating expenses are guaranteed by the government and borrowed from banks, and half are obtained by selling materials. So far, CNRRA's operating expenses have totaled approximately US$10 million; (5) Regarding the rumor that Mr. LaGuardia will come to China within the month, Mr. Chiang had not heard of it.</p>
<p>UNRRA Director Announced He Will Recall the Deputy Director</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, November 11] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that the Acting Director of the UNRRA China Office, Mr. Lai, will be recalled, and his successor will be announced soon. According to UNRRA sources, a temporary emergency meeting of a committee will be held in Shanghai on the 17th of this month to discuss the various issues caused by LaGuardia's announcement of the suspension of relief supplies to China. LaGuardia also said that he will go to Europe to attend the UNRRA Council meeting in Geneva on August 5. Relief matters in Europe will end at the end of this year, so this meeting will be the last one. As for relief matters in China, although it has been stipulated that it will end at the end of March next year, the materials supplied for China may not be completed by then, so they must be manufactured and handed over at any time. For example, Australia is manufacturing fifty railway locomotives for the China Office, which cannot be completed in a few months. (Regarding the relief materials obtained by China from UNRRA, there is a special article on page 8, please refer to it.)</p>
<h3>Wuxian County Suffers from Continuous Rain and Flooding, Inundating Tens of Thousands of Mu of Farmland</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, November 12] For the past two weeks, this county has been experiencing continuous heavy rain, and the river water has risen sharply. Low-lying areas have become swamps, and tens of thousands of mu of farmland have been flooded. The disaster is already taking shape and is deeply worrying. The most severely affected areas are the various villages in the fifth district of the county, such as Xudu Village, because they are all located near Taihu Lake and have low-lying terrain. After continuous wind and rain, the lake water overflowed, broke through the embankments, and flooded into the fields, with water accumulating several feet deep. Houses were washed away, cattle drowned, and agricultural tools were scattered by the floodwaters. The disaster situation is extremely tragic. Currently, there are thousands of disaster victims in the affected area who are without food or clothing. Although the township offices have reported the disaster situation to the county for assistance, there is no good solution.</p>
<h3>LaGuardia Talks About the Intention of Suspension: To Help China Transport Materials to the Interior</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, November 10] (Delayed) UNRRA Director LaGuardia told reporters today that his temporary suspension of material transportation to China does not mean stopping relief to China. This move is also to help China quickly transport relief materials to the interior. He declared that emergency food will continue to be transported, but the food unloaded at the ports of Shanghai, Kowloon, and Qingdao must be cleared immediately. LaGuardia said that there are currently 20 ships unloading goods in Shanghai, and another 20 are waiting for empty docks. He emphasized that agricultural and industrial machinery will not be transported again until the ports, which are already "suffering from congestion," are cleared. Regarding this, LaGuardia said that the petition from UNRRA China Office staff did not affect his actions. He had anticipated this action before taking office as Director. The Director of the UNRRA China Office will be announced soon, but he declined to specify who it would be. LaGuardia also told reporters not to confuse UNRRA with CNRRA. He accused CNRRA of demanding "good items" and blaming UNRRA for replacing them with unsatisfactory items. LaGuardia frankly stated that according to the UNRRA charter, food must be transported to all areas in need, regardless of political beliefs. He said that although internal transportation is difficult, everyone knows it, but he believes there is room for improvement. He hopes that food transportation will be rapid. LaGuardia also announced that he had sent a letter to Chairman Chiang on May 28, suggesting improvements to the method of distributing supplies so that China could continue to receive UNRRA materials. LaGuardia said that he had received a generally courteous reply from the government. This morning, Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that he had learned that LaGuardia had sent a letter to Chairman Chiang, but declined to comment on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih Flew from Shanghai to Beijing and Spoke Freely with Reporters About His Impressions of the Past Nine Years in the United States. He Will Visit Chairman Chiang and then Go to Peking to Take Over His Duties.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 12] Dr. Hu Shih, President of National Peking University, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th. Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chiang Menglin, Hang Liwu, Liu Kai, and others went to the airport to welcome him. Mr. Hu has been abroad for nine years, and now that he has returned, his hair is already gray, but his spirit is still very robust. When reporters asked about his impressions of his travels in the United States, Mr. Hu said: "I have lived in the United States for more than 20 years, and I feel that the foundation of the United States is solid, its economy and industry are advancing rapidly, and the strength of its social organizations is unexpectedly great." He continued: "During the war, the U.S. government, due to war-related reasons, trained students in various universities to learn the languages of countries such as China, Japan, and Burma. There were thousands of people studying Chinese throughout the country, and some of them may continue to study in depth to become new talents." When reporters asked about his political views, Mr. Hu said that he had been in the United States for nine years and was not very familiar with the domestic situation, so he did not want to express his opinions. He said in a guarded tone: "I would like to take five months to study as a student." He described his research work in the United States, saying that he had spent more than four years reorganizing Chinese intellectual history and old works. Some of them have been revised, and he has also written several monographs. This reorganization work remains to be completed. Regarding cultural cooperation between China and foreign countries and post-war cultural construction, Mr. Hu said: "The exchange of professors and sending students abroad are greatly affected by foreign exchange. The foreign language proficiency of students also needs to be discussed. Domestic cultural workers cannot maintain their livelihoods, which greatly affects research work. As for cultural construction, it will still be based on the self-efforts of domestic cultural institutions and will require long-term efforts. Emphasis should also be placed on basic sciences." Mr. Hu will visit Chairman Chiang in the coming days and consult with Vice President Fu Sinian, who is currently acting as president, about the issue of Peking University's resumption of operations. After a short stay, he will go to Shanghai to pick up his family and transfer to Peking. Minister Wang Shijie will hold a welcome reception for Mr. Hu at the International Social Center from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the 15th.

<h3>Jiang Kanghu, a Traitor, Was Tried Yesterday. He Claimed to Be a Member with no Real Power. Wang Shijing, another Traitor, Preserved the Silver in Tianjin.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, November 12] At 10:00 a.m. this morning, the Capital High Court publicly tried Jiang Kanghu, the puppet Minister of the Examination Yuan. Jiang was hunched over, his shoulders were crooked, and he was so emaciated that he was no longer human. According to his confession, he is 64 years old, from Jiangxi, passed the county-level imperial examination at the age of 14 (late Qing Dynasty), studied in Japan at the age of 18, and became a professor at Kyoto University at the age of 20. He once organized the Socialist Party. In the second year of the Republic (1913), he went to the United States with former Chairman Lin Sen and served as a professor at the University of California and the director of the Oriental Literature Department of the Library of Congress in the United States for many years. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he was summoned by Wang Jingwei and joined the puppet organization. He claimed that Wang Jingwei's later actions were surrounded by petty people and were very dictatorial. He put forward six points of opinion: (1) He did not recognize traitors; (2) The regulations on punishing traitors were not known in the occupied areas, so they could not be applied; (3) His position as a member of the Central Political Committee was an ex officio member with no voting rights; (4) He opposed the declaration of war against Britain and the United States; (5) Although the treaties signed with the Japanese invaders were humiliating and detrimental to national sovereignty, the fact was that the country had already been occupied at that time, so it was not easy to regain some rights; (6) The Examination Yuan had no treasonous actions. The trial adjourned at noon, and the court ordered a retrial at a later date. Jiang was returned to custody.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, November 12] Wang Shijing, the puppet President of the United Reserve Bank of North China, said during his preliminary hearing at the Capital High Court on the 12th that the total amount of notes issued by the puppet bank as of the enemy's surrender was 123.8 billion yuan, and the gold turned over was 5 tons. In addition, he presented evidence that the silver, amounting to 60 million yuan, used as issuing reserves in Tianjin before the war, was preserved under his protection without any loss, and was turned over to Manager Bian of the Central Bank after the victory. Wang was interrogated at the High Court at 4:30 p.m. today. Renowned lawyer Jiang Yong was his defense lawyer, and lawyer Cui Peijun, appointed by the court, also appeared in court. In addition to the two matters listed above, the defendant tried his best to explain that his collaboration with the enemy was not "unavoidable" but "purposeful." He claimed that since the September 18th Incident (1931), he had always remained in the Northeast as the manager of the Bank of China in the Northeast and had established contact with Wang Pengsheng, director of the International Affairs Research Institute of the Military Commission, for intelligence. Later, he successively served as the Minister of Finance of the puppet Provisional Government of North China, the President of the Puppet Reserve Bank, the Standing Committee Member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and the Governor-General of the Finance Department, and the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. During the seven and a half years, he maintained close contact with Wang Pengsheng, provided intelligence, and flew to Chongqing to report after the victory and returned to Peking to handle the handover and reception. He requested the court to investigate the evidence in detail and conduct a fair trial. At 6:30 p.m., the court ordered him to present more concrete evidence and scheduled another trial.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Problem of UNRRA Halting the Shipment of Supplies to China</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th Dispatch: UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that, effective immediately, all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China would be suspended. However, essential food supplies such as wheat, rice, grains, and milk would continue to be shipped, conditional on the Chinese government quickly clearing the ports and the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) distributing relief supplies to the Chinese interior in a satisfactory manner. This unexpected action by LaGuardia was reportedly based on reports from some officials and staff of the UNRRA Shanghai branch, citing two main reasons: first, the Chinese government failed to provide funding, hindering the rapid distribution of relief supplies to the interior; second, the Chinese government allocated too little to the Communist areas, raising suspicions that the government was using relief supplies as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<p>However, a subsequent dispatch on the 11th stated that LaGuardia clarified the matter, saying that his intention was only to help China resolve port congestion, not to stop relief work in China. As long as ports like Shanghai, Kowloon, and Qingdao are cleared, UNRRA can continue to ship relief supplies to China. This coincides with what the Chinese government spokesperson said the day before: "The initial impression of the general public is that this is a political action, but in reality, it is due to the congestion in Shanghai's port." Furthermore, U.S. government officials stated that this action by UNRRA should not be regarded as reflecting the opinion of the U.S. government. It is evident that rumors circulating outside, implying serious political implications, are clearly propaganda with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, in addition to the statement issued by the Chinese government spokesperson the day before, Chiang Ting-fu, Director-General of CNRRA, also met with reporters yesterday afternoon and responded. He mainly explained that the CNRRA's distribution of relief supplies was not based on political regions but solely on the needs of each area and the convenience of transportation. Out of the 560,000 tons of UNRRA supplies shipped to China, the CNRRA has already transported 480,000 tons to the interior. Therefore, Director-General Chiang firmly believes that LaGuardia, upon understanding the true situation, will quickly restore the shipment of supplies to China.</p>
<p>We believe that the UNRRA Director's action is indeed due to the current transportation difficulties in China. At the same time, we also believe that the Chinese government and society are very anxious to find ways to clear transportation routes. The instruction from Chairman Chiang, stating that transportation of relief supplies and personnel should be given priority and not be delayed or obstructed, should be regarded as representing the attitude of the Chinese government. According to Liu Nianzhi, General Manager of the Shanghai China Dock Company, the congestion in various docks and warehouses in the city has improved slightly recently, but the supplies stockpiled by public entities and UNRRA remain substantial, often unmoved for months, causing incoming ships carrying cargo to be unable to unload upon arrival, with an average of twenty ships being detained in the port daily. This shows that society is also paying close attention to and striving to improve the clearance of Shanghai's port. Now, with the stimulus of the UNRRA Director's announcement of the temporary suspension of industrial and agricultural equipment shipments, those responsible for managing transportation will likely expedite clearance efforts. If this can be achieved, then, as LaGuardia explained, relief supplies can naturally continue to be shipped to China without doubt.</p>
<p>However, in any case, we are very saddened by the suddenness of the UNRRA Director's action, and even more saddened that some officials and staff of the UNRRA China branch may harbor some prejudices towards the situation in China. During this World War, China suffered the longest from the ravages of war, with the most severe damage to industry and agriculture. Famines like those in Hunan and Guangxi were largely caused by enemy destruction. Transportation and industry were devastated first by the Japanese army and then by the Communist army, making them particularly dilapidated. No country in the world needs relief for the restoration of its industry and agriculture more than China. The suspension of relief supplies will cause greater and longer-lasting suffering to most Chinese people. This is certainly not the original intention of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and it violates the grand aspiration of the late U.S. President Roosevelt to help the poor and save lives. It is indeed not easy to quickly and universally transport any kind of supplies to impoverished areas in the interior. The enormous transportation costs are unimaginable. The unloading expenses for one ship of supplies alone require 100 million legal tender, not including warehouse storage fees. When the Chinese government's finances were extremely difficult after the war, it still allocated 4,320 billion legal tender in the budget. To achieve rapid distribution of supplies, the CNRRA had to sell some of the relief supplies, but it did not exceed the principle set by President Truman, that is, the portion of UNRRA supplies sold should only be used to supplement insufficient funding. Now, some people in the UNRRA branch are criticizing the Chinese government for not providing sufficient funding and arguing that the CNRRA should not sell relief supplies, which is unreasonable in both principle and fact.</p>
<p>As for the areas occupied by the Communist army, the Chinese government has never discriminated. The Chinese government represents the entire Chinese people and naturally treats everyone equally, with no divisions in relief work. On the contrary, CNRRA relief supplies passing through Communist-controlled areas are often forcibly detained by the Communist army and cannot be distributed to the disaster victims. Recent incidents include: (1) Over 2,000 catties of cotton seeds transported by the CNRRA from Yuncheng were detained in Jishan; (2) 885 bags of flour and some milk powder transported by the CNRRA from Jinan to Liaocheng were detained outside Liaocheng; (3) Fourteen CNRRA trucks traveling empty from Jinan to Qingdao were detained when passing through Yidu. All these incidents have been reported to Zhou Enlai with a request for release, but no response has been received so far. However, despite the Communist army's detention, the CNRRA is still striving to transport relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas. For example, 1,300 tons were transported to Yantai yesterday, and recently, relief supplies have often been transported to northern Jiangsu. These are all undeniable facts.</p>
<p>According to the explanation of Chiang Ting-fu, Director-General of CNRRA, the Communist-controlled areas mostly produce grain and require less food relief. However, they have a great need for medicines, and the CNRRA often purchases large quantities of medicines to supply them because UNRRA sometimes cannot meet this demand. It is also evident that the Communist army's destruction of transportation everywhere makes it increasingly difficult to transport relief supplies, and the inconsistent orders from various military units make it impossible for relief workers to operate. Now, some people in the UNRRA branch want to place all the responsibility entirely on the National Government, thus recommending that UNRRA stop supplying materials to punish the Chinese people. Fortunately, the UNRRA Director stated that he did not stop all shipments of relief supplies to China based on their reasons. Otherwise, would it be very unwise to act unwisely? Because now there are some elements who are expanding their "anti-American" propaganda on one hand and weakening the credibility of the National Government on the other, they must take advantage of any opportunity. We only need to see that as soon as the UNRRA Director's order was issued, the Communist spokespersons in Nanjing and Beiping successively issued lengthy talks, exaggerating the unfairness of the CNRRA's distribution of materials, and the American Communist Herten also represented the so-called "Communist Area Relief Association," propagating that the Communist area did not receive any relief materials. From these traces, we can know how the Communist Party and its kind are singing a duet, trying their best to alienate Sino-American friendship. Because of this, we believe that UNRRA can earnestly discuss with the Chinese government to improve transportation methods, but should never abandon eating because of choking and stop shipping relief supplies to China, giving these "anti-American" propagandists a new opportunity.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Sentenced for Murder and Arson</p>
<p>Wang Gaosheng, the bandit leader of Xiyang Township in the sixth district of Jiangyin, was 43 years old and originally a small worker in a pile of stacks.

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Conclude Two-Day Discussion; No Agreement Reached on German Issue; Decision to Postpone Meeting and Reconvene in November</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: When the four-power foreign ministers' meeting reopened this afternoon, Burns launched another attack on the economic barriers to the division of Germany, demanding that the Soviet Union support the unification plan, and implying that if the Soviet Union could accept this plan, the United States would allow the shipment of reparations from the U.S. occupied zone to the Soviet occupied zone. This meeting is feared to be the last meeting, and Burns is preparing to fly back to the country on Saturday. Molotov proposed to end the meeting today. The foreign ministers of the four countries are eager to return to their countries so that they can have a chance to rest before attending the peace conference on July 29.</p>
<p>[Another News] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: Burns today criticized the Soviet Union in harsh terms, due to the cession of Silesia and the Konigsberg East Prussian region, it has directly and indirectly obtained 14 billion yuan of compensation from Germany, in response to Molotov's repeated request to demand 10 billion yuan of compensation from Germany based on the Yalta Agreement. In his speech yesterday, Mr. Bei categorically stated that the agreement has not yet been established. According to the Potsdam regulations, Soviet reparations should be obtained from the country's occupied area and supplemented by the limited factory equipment in the west. He also said that the number of reparations that the Soviet Union has obtained from the Soviet-occupied zone cannot be estimated accurately.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 11th Electricity] The four-nation foreign ministers' meeting continued today and decided to postpone the meeting until November of this year after another meeting on the 13th of this month, and then hold a temporary meeting to discuss the German issue. The meeting lasted for four and a half hours today, discussing the issue of compensation, setting up a small group committee to investigate the actual situation of Germany's demilitarization, and other issues related to the country, and no agreement was reached. Today's meeting was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who immediately requested that the four powers decide on the date of the postponement. U.S. Secretary of State Burns replied that the German and Austrian issues must be discussed before they can be concluded, but the four powers finally agreed to postpone the meeting on the 13th and hold two meetings tomorrow morning and afternoon to complete the current work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th Electricity] The Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed the German issue all day today. Burns proposed that one or all of the other three occupation zones of Germany should join the U.S. military zone to form a unified economy. It is best to set up a central economic institution in the whole of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. He also suggested that the Saar region may not be temporarily included in the jurisdiction of these economic institutions, but should still be governed by France pending the final resolution of the German Western Frontier issue. Bevan also suggested reducing the economic barriers between the German occupation zones so that materials can be freely exchanged, all of which were opposed by Molotov. Bevan said that Britain no longer intends to continue borrowing to maintain the relief work in the British military zone. The industry in the British military zone must be restored to production, so that the whole region no longer relies entirely on Britain. Therefore, the establishment of a unified national economy, based on the experience of the occupation zones, to promote the economic self-reliance of the bridge country is the best proposal. The four foreign ministers discussed for a long time, but no agreement was reached. Finally, Molotov's request was still agreed, and it was decided to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the German issue.</p>

<p>Military Spending Increases Sharply Every Year During the War</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th Electricity] The British government released a white paper for the first time announcing the military expenditure spent by the British army in the four years of the war. Among them, the army spent the most, accounting for 244 million U.S. dollars in 1939, increasing to 1.076 billion U.S. dollars in 1941, and reaching 1.654 billion U.S. dollars in 1943.</p>

<h3>Vietnam's French Officials Order Evacuation of Women and Children from Major Cities; Surface Calm During French-Vietnamese Negotiations; French Troop Transport Truck Ambushed Near Saigon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch] During the French-Vietnamese negotiations, the atmosphere here appears superficially extremely calm. There have been no incidents between French and Vietnamese military police for two weeks. Vietnamese newspapers, regardless of their party affiliation, unanimously support the speech by the Vietnamese representative Phạm Văn Đồng, and denounce the partition of Cochinchina as an unforgivable act of aggression. French newspapers regard the Vietnamese representative's speech as a bomb thrown into the adjustment of French-Vietnamese relations, which does not contribute to friendly negotiations. Vietnamese officials here have not yet criticized the negotiations, but have ordered the evacuation of Vietnamese women and children from major cities. It is said that this is in preparation for avoiding unnecessary sacrifice in the event that the Paris negotiations fail and unfortunately, war breaks out between Vietnam and France. In recent days, many Vietnamese people have been evacuated in accordance with the order, causing slight fluctuations in the peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th dispatch] A French military truck carrying many soldiers, traveling on a bridge near Cu Chi, 40 miles northwest of Saigon, was attacked.

<h3>Egyptian Government Authorities Suppress Communist Party Activities; Arrest Suspects to Maintain Social Tranquility</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 11th dispatch] Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi Pasha announced today that the active activities of the Communist Party in Egypt are sufficient to endanger national security, and the government will implement new laws to prohibit them. Several Communist Party publications have been ordered to cease publication.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 11th dispatch] It was recently learned from high-ranking Egyptian police that Egypt is arresting Communist suspects, with approximately 160 people detained in total, including 32 in Cairo. The Egyptian government is now extremely concerned about the activities and influence of the Communist Party in Egypt.

<h3>There are Also Plants on Mars; Soviet Astronomer Says</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th dispatch] The Soviet scientific community has discovered plants growing in the polar regions of Mars, as well as tall trees, which are currently under research. According to Professor Tikhov, a renowned astronomer and researcher at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the first space explorers to reach Mars in the future will discover a type of plant identical to that on Earth. The polar regions of Mars are covered with ice and snow, similar to Earth. The "oceans" on Mars are actually plant regions. These regions are lush green in winter, like young seedlings; in summer, they turn brown, as if scorched by the sun. This view has sparked debate among other scientists, such as Professor Sharonov, who claims that these plants are affected by infrared radiation, and the photographs taken are the opposite of reality. In other words, the plants on Mars should have white leaves, which appear dark when photographed from Earth. Tikhov countered that, based on observations of various plants on Earth, plants that grow in extremely cold climates absorb infrared radiation, so they emit less infrared radiation than plants in warmer climates. He believes that in the extremely cold climate of Mars, these plants have lost the ability to emit infrared radiation.</p>
<h3>Armed Peasant Uprising in the Philippines; Constabulary Rushed to Luzon to Suppress It; Left-Leaning Guerrillas Number Over 30,000; President Roxas Says Peaceful Resolution is Hoped For</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 12th dispatch] The "People's Anti-Japanese Army" in central Luzon is an anti-government guerrilla force composed of armed peasants, numbering over 30,000. Central Luzon is in a constant state of terror, and the rice production in the four most densely populated provinces of Pampanga, Tarlac, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija will be greatly affected. The "People's Anti-Japanese Army" has not yet officially responded to Roxas's statement, and clashes are currently occurring again. Before President Roxas took office, reports of clashes between the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," pro-government guerrillas, and the Philippine Constabulary were heard almost daily. There were many casualties on both sides. The army was formed shortly after the fall of Bataan, and all its weapons were taken from the battlefield, including both American and Japanese weapons. The army's leader is Taruc, 32 years old, who was the secretary of the Central Luzon Farmers' Association when the Pacific War broke out. He once held a government position, but was dismissed due to his left-leaning ideas. After the US military recovered the Philippines, he was once detained. Later, he was elected as a candidate for the Philippine House of Representatives, calling for the organization of a more democratic government and the implementation of land reform as the vice president of the Democratic Alliance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 11th dispatch] The strength of the Pampanga provincial government has almost doubled today. 1,000 constabulary soldiers suddenly arrived this morning in this center of peasant unrest. President Roxas issued a statement after meeting with Huk leader Taruc of Nueva Ecija today, saying that a peaceful resolution is hoped for.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test; Preliminary Report</h3>
<p>Blondy Says Bomb Did Not Hit the Target</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] General Compson, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Expert Committee, submitted a report to President Truman today, stating that the Bikini atomic bomb bombing test has obtained appropriate records for redesigning warships and minimizing casualties among personnel on the upper decks and decks of warships. The manpower and resources consumed in this test are justified from the perspective of the records obtained and reducing the distance of guesswork. The atomic bomb damaged more ships than any other bombing. In this test, the atomic bomb was dropped at the intended altitude toward the target ships. The intensity of the explosion was comparable to that of the previous three atomic bombs. Ships more than three-quarters of a mile from the center suffered less damage, but research on the effects of flashes and radiant energy proved that casualties among exposed personnel would be very high. Even if personnel on board were sheltered by the ship's hull and located on the shaded side of radiant energy, they would be burned immediately. As for the cost of the test, there is no reliable estimate yet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bikini Atoll, 11th dispatch] General Blondy, commander of the atomic bomb test, said that if the fourth atomic bomb had exploded directly above the battleship "Nevada," the ship would have either sunk or been completely destroyed. This statement is inconsistent with his previous statement that the atomic bomb had hit the target accurately. As for a reporter's claim that the atomic bomb exploded two seconds before the scheduled time, Blondy has denied it.</p>

In addition to cargo, the plane was carrying passengers. There were quite a few casualties when the accident occurred. It has been confirmed that the co-pilot and radio operator both died, and Captain Shen was seriously injured. Chen Wenkun, the chief of flight operations, personally flew to Jinan this morning at 8:00 AM to investigate the cause of the accident.

<h3>Applause Below the Stage, Sadness in the Hearts of Those on Stage; Ma Lianliang was Interrogated Yesterday; Expresses a Clear Conscience; Bailed Out by Sun Lanting and Others to Continue Participating in Charity Performances</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Because the famous actor Ma Lianliang was accused of being a collaborator, the Hebei High Court, after investigation, has sealed Ma's residence in Peiping and issued an arrest warrant a few days ago. Ma's movements in Shanghai have therefore attracted attention. The Shanghai High Court received the arrest warrant the night before last and immediately sent four bailiffs to the Tianchan Theater manager's office, ordering Ma to surrender to the court yesterday morning, so that the Hebei High Court could send someone to Shanghai to take him into custody. Ma immediately expressed his intention to stop performing and surrender that night. However, those in charge of planning the charity performance to raise money for disaster relief in northern Jiangsu and Hunan, knowing that Ma had a strong appeal in the charity performance, immediately requested on his behalf that he be allowed to surrender after completing the charity performance, and Sun Liangliang and two others were responsible for guaranteeing it. Because the matter concerned a good cause, the High Court granted their request.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Ma surrendered to the High Court in Tilanqiao. The prosecutor opened a court session and questioned him. Ma said that his elderly mother and children were all in Peiping, and that he had acted with a clear conscience, and would go to Peiping after completing the charity performance. After the interrogation, he was released on bail by the original guarantors. Therefore, Ma still took to the stage at Tianchan Theater last night to raise funds for the disaster relief in northern Jiangsu and Hunan, performing "Killing the Fish" with Mei Lanfang. The audience was full and applause rose continuously.</p>
<p>Last night, a reporter went to the backstage of Tianchan Theater to interview Ma Lianliang and asked about his experience of going to "Manchukuo" that year. He said: In August of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), the Muslim Association of Shenyang, in order to raise funds for the Northeast Muslim Middle School, publicly elected Chairman Zuo Shulun to invite him to the Northeast to perform charity shows. As a Muslim, I should support the fundraising and education of my fellow Muslims. However, ever since the July 7th Incident, I had not wanted to set foot in Manchukuo, and had declined more than a dozen invitations from the Northeast. Therefore, I did not immediately agree to it. Later, a Japanese man named Sadatori, on behalf of the "Manchukuo Performing Arts Association," along with Zhu Fuchang, the president of "369 Pictorial," came to force me to sign a contract to perform commercial shows in Manchukuo. They relied on the backing of the Japanese Army Press Department and used threatening tactics. Although I declined repeatedly, I was ultimately unable to refuse. I agreed with them that after arriving in the Northeast, I would first perform charity shows for the Muslim community and then sing commercial shows. However, after arriving in Shenyang, they suddenly changed their initial agreement and insisted on performing commercial shows first. At that time, I was in an unfree environment, and I had no choice but to listen to them. So, I sang commercial shows at the Shenyang International Theater for 20 days, charity shows in Shenyang for 12 days, commercial shows at the Changchun Capital Theater for 5 days, and charity performances for the deaf school for 2 days. Finally, I performed commercial shows at the Harbin Huale Stage for 9 days, totaling 34 days of commercial shows in the Northeast. The box office was not bad, and I received a total of 80,000 yuan in bao yin (performance fees) in Manchukuo currency. This is verifiable in the Muslim Association's accounts. Therefore, the trip to the Northeast, in addition to charity performances for the Muslim community, was actually of a commercial nature, with no "cultural envoy" title, and I did not accept any appointment documents from the puppet North China government. The plays I performed were all old plays. The Japanese had previously banned national justice plays such as "Chuan Long Zhu," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," and "Si Jinshi." Therefore, in the Northeast, I never engaged in propaganda for the enemy and puppets, nor did I participate in any enemy and puppet celebrations. After the victory, I came to Shanghai from Peiping. The outside world said that I was fleeing punishment, but in reality, Shanghai was not a concession. Therefore, as soon as the charity shows for the Liyuan Guild and the scholarship fund were completed, I would return to Peiping. Ma also said that when Minister Bai went to the Northeast this time, he added support to the establishment of the Northeast Muslim Middle School, and there is a letter to prove it.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminal Major General Sato Has Been Escorted to Military Tribunal</h3>

<h3>Puppet Ambassador Wu Kaisheng; Full of Underground Work; Submits Proof Documents</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Wu Kaisheng, who once served as the vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the puppet ambassador to Italy, was interrogated again in the High Court yesterday. Wu testified that he served in the diplomatic service before the war and then practiced law. After the war started, he engaged in relief work. After Shanghai fell, he sheltered personnel working for the Ministry of Communications and set up a secret radio station in his private residence. Later, he was discovered by the Japanese, who threatened and intimidated him. Therefore, in June of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he took the title of member of the Examination and Selection Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan as a cover. However, this puppet position did not have a salary. Later, Chu Minyi, the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, appointed him as the puppet minister to Italy without his consent, but he never went abroad. Subsequently, he was appointed as the puppet Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs without seeking his consent, but he did not take office. However, from the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) until the victory of the War of Resistance, I had been doing underground work. This was registered with the central government. There were three or four telegrams to and from Chongqing, one of which was directly addressed to Chairman Chiang. During his tenure, he rescued arrested underground workers such as Zhu Shaoxiang and Yao Jiaozhan. He also collected intelligence for the American representative in Peiping, Fatzden. All of this has documentary proof, and it is not just empty talk. In court, the defense lawyer presented many documents, and Sun Yiying testified in court, saying that the defendant did have a relationship with the Military Statistics Bureau. The court decided to retry the case on the morning of the 18th.</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Lines Between Peiping and Shanghai Being Prepared for Expansion</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] According to Yu Bingjian, director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, to the reporter yesterday, the bureau's current equipment is far worse than before the war, but its business is more prosperous than before the war. Therefore, even with more than 2,000 employees, it is still difficult to cope. The main reason for the congestion of telegrams may be that the telegram fee is too cheap at the current prices, but the price increase is of great importance and is pending government decision. The previously planned international calls between Shanghai and New York are difficult to prepare for a while because the equipment has not been imported yet. The situation of long-distance telephone calls between Peiping and Shanghai has improved slightly, and plans are being made to add lines recently.</p>

<h3>Air Freight Between China and the United States: Arrival in Two Days and Nights; Specific Plans... Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] William Hunt &amp; Co., in this city, has recently been appointed as the agent for American Airlines air freight services to expand its business and facilitate trade between Chinese and American businesses, and will soon be officially operating. Chinese export goods can be delivered to San Francisco within 48 hours, and vice versa. According to Li Pinkao, the leader of the American Airlines flight team in Shanghai, these transport planes are giant DC-4s, with a maximum cargo capacity of 20,000 pounds. However, due to the long distance, space must be reserved for fuel, so the usual load is around 16,000 pounds. Each plane has a crew of five, including the team leader, pilot, mechanic, assistant pilot, and radio operator. American Airlines transport planes first arrived in Shanghai on the 9th of this month carrying a large batch of UNRRA anti-epidemic vaccines, and returned to the United States the day before yesterday.

<h3>"Ma Fu Baosheng" Served as an Official for Four Months: Claims He Was Just a Puppet</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xie Baosheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai's underworld, was once nicknamed "Ma Fu Baosheng" because he used to sell horses in the Mongolian region of Guanwai. He operated businesses such as the Xianle Dance Hall and the Kade Bathhouse in Shanghai. Although he had a wide circle of "friends" and many followers, he lacked intelligence. He was arrested after the victory because he had served as the deputy director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Department in September 1943, and was once tried in the High Court. During his retrial yesterday, Xie argued that he had always been patriotic and had done a great deal of underground work. From 1937 to 1939, he had contacted the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander and risked transporting steel bars, cement, radios, and other military supplies, and donated 500 sets of cotton uniforms to the 71st Army. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Maurice, his former English boss from his horse-selling days in Mongolia, was detained in a concentration camp, and he repeatedly provided him with supplies. Later, his work was discovered by the Japanese, so he took a puppet position as cover. After serving as an "official" for four months, he wanted to resign, but it was not approved, so he continued in a daze. However, he never attended a meeting or approved any official documents during his tenure. The director was responsible for everything, and he was just a puppet. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant remains in custody.</p>

<h3>Willing to "Be Stubborn to the End" for Construction: Rear Area Factory Rehabilitation Committee Hosts Press Conference to Report</h3>
<p>Amid unprecedented industrial headwinds of foreign goods flooding in, exorbitant wages, transportation bottlenecks, heavy taxes, and currency inflation, the Rear Area Factory Rehabilitation Committee hosted its first press conference yesterday, announcing its past experiences, current plans, and future direction. Chief Secretary Xie first reported on the hardships encountered by the committee's member factories when they moved inland nine years ago, until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the change in the economic status of the rear area, when the committee's member factories formally declared their "death." He concluded by saying that since "being stubborn" had been done for nine years, the committee should also follow through "to the end" on the country's ten-year industrial construction plan. Since January of this year, the committee has proposed a joint factory plan to quickly restart hundreds of enemy and puppet factories through joint ventures or delegated operations, but it has not been adopted. Recently, the committee has submitted this plan directly to Chairman Chiang and President Song and met with Minister Wang Yunwu. They received a reply stating that implementation measures have been drafted and are awaiting President Song's approval, and that President Song has no major objections. Following the speech, Joint Chief Secretaries Ye and Wo reported on recent work. The takeover and investigation team is about to arrive in Shanghai. Industrial departments are difficult for non-technical experts to understand, so close contact should be established with the team, and efforts should be made to rent mailbox No. 2193 as a tip box. It is hoped that all parties will provide information at any time, and the committee will send specialized engineers to conduct detailed research and investigations, and be responsible for reporting, to clarify the industrial future. The committee's office is now located at 12 Jinling East Road, and it is hoped that all sectors will provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Enters Jiangxi from Fujian: (Shanghai) Spared from Attack</h3>
<p>It is reported that the typhoon originated from 20 degrees north latitude, 125 degrees east longitude, north of Luzon Island, and began to develop at 2 p.m. on the 10th.

<h3>Major Corruption Case in the Railway Bureau: Clues Found in Confessions; Continued Trial the Day After Tomorrow May Lead to New Developments</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the District Procuratorate's Chief Prosecutor Quan actively launched an investigation into the major corruption case in the Railway Bureau, the inside story of the corruption has not yet been fully revealed, but clues have been found from the confessions of the defendants. At around 10 a.m. yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Quan and Clerk Tao Bohua continued the court investigation, focusing on the parts of Ding Shuhui's acceptance and distribution of bribes, and separately summoned and questioned three suspects.

<p>[Another Report] The District Procuratorate recently received a secret accusation letter accusing Railway Bureau officials of corruption, signed Zhang, but the corruption described was mostly empty words and not detailed, so the prosecutor in charge of the case summoned the person to the address, but there was no such person.</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Hosts Reporters for Visit to Epidemic Prevention Facilities: Over 1.3 Million People Vaccinated; Commendable Spirit of Boy Scouts at the North Station</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 2 p.m. yesterday, the Health Bureau hosted reporters from the city's newspapers for a visit to epidemic prevention facilities. About 30 reporters arrived and gathered in Room 209 of the Municipal Government. Director Zhang reported on the progress of recent epidemic prevention work, and then they boarded six special vehicles prepared by the bureau, led by Chen Bangxian, Director of Personnel, and Jiang Chengshi, Director of Environmental Health, and set off for the scheduled destinations.</p>
<p>The places visited yesterday included the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road, the cholera epidemic area in Zhabei, the quarantine work at the North Railway Station, the Municipal First Infectious Disease Hospital on Tiantong'an Road, and Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge. Finally, Director Zhang Wei hosted a dinner at the YMCA before dispersing.</p>
<p>After this visit, the reporters felt that the Health Bureau's efforts in epidemic prevention over the past month could not be denied. This was fully demonstrated by the facts seen by the reporters yesterday. In the cholera epidemic area, the Health Bureau sends personnel to spray DDT on the garbage every day, and the earthen wells used by citizens are disinfected with chlorine gas every day. More than 5,000 earthen wells have been disinfected. The disinfection of patient's homes is also taken very seriously. Whenever a case of cholera is discovered, the entire family is immediately disinfected, and vaccination teams are set up nearby to force nearby residents to be vaccinated. The Health Bureau has vaccinated 1,355,210 people, and 22,500 people were vaccinated yesterday alone. The best results were achieved at the North Station, where a total of 15,000 people can be vaccinated in one day. The service spirit of the Boy Scouts in the station is truly commendable! They half-pushed and half-pulled passengers without epidemic certificates to the vaccination station, begging you to get a shot. This kind of hard work can only be done by strong young men. But the Boy Scouts are working day and night. They do not need any remuneration. According to their unanimous statement, the only thing that pains them is the lack of cooperation from the military and police, which is just like what Director Chen said: "Chinese people have a bad habit of thinking that being able to break the rules is a sign of their superiority!" But epidemic prevention must be comprehensive, and it is hoped that all sectors can cooperate closely!</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Epidemic Prevention Committee announced: Yesterday there were 87 new cases of cholera and 2 deaths, bringing the total to 1792 cases and 128 deaths. According to statistics from the Health Bureau, the mortality rate of patients in this city is about 7.3%, which is much lower compared to the mortality rate of 30% for patients in Guangzhou this year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Needs Large Quantities of Salt</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road has been crowded with people seeking treatment in the continuous rain. There are more than 700 people every day. On July 5th, when the weather cleared up a little, the number of patients surged. All 100 free beds were full every day. The hospital is a private charitable hospital, and due to the heavy medical work and huge expenses, the funding is extremely tight. It is hoped that people in the community will provide full assistance and generous donations. In addition, the hospital uses 1,200 pounds of saline solution every day to treat cholera patients and urgently needs a large supply of physiological saline. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Province Orders All Universities to Open Additional Classes This Autumn</h3>
<p>So That This Year's High School Graduates Can Enter University</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu] It is quite a problem for this year's high school graduates in Sichuan Province to enter university. There are many people but few schools, which the authorities consider a hidden worry. According to Director Liu of the Education Department, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, various universities have returned east, and Chengdu only has Sichuan University, West China University, Chenghua University, Provincial Sports College, Provincial Art College, and other schools. However, there are more than 20,000 high school graduates in Chongqing and Chengdu. The Education Department has already telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, asking him to find a way to accommodate them. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has issued a telegram ordering all universities in Sichuan Province to open additional classes in all departments this autumn to facilitate the entry of high school students into university.

<h3>Overview of Education in Gansu Province: Education Funding Ranks Sixth Nationally; National Lanzhou University Scheduled to Open During Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>Gansu is the cradle of Chinese culture and now the center of the Northwest. However, due to transportation barriers, economic difficulties, and a lack of talent, the development of education and culture has been relatively slow. With the Anti-Japanese War in progress, Gansu's position has become increasingly important. Promoting education to meet the needs of national reconstruction is a matter of utmost urgency. Mr. Tong He (Xi Gu) took office as the head of the province at this opportune moment and actively promoted education throughout the province. After eight years of effort, he was able to lay a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>(A) Higher Education: Gansu originally had only one provincial college with about 50 students. In recent years, with the assistance of the provincial government, the central government successively established the National Northwest Agricultural College, the National Northwest Normal College, and the National Northwest Medical College in Gansu. The provincial Gansu College was also transferred to national status. Currently, the Northwest Agricultural College has more than 400 students, the Northwest Normal College has more than 1,000 students, the Northwest Medical College has more than 160 students, and the Gansu College has more than 300 students. This summer vacation, National Lanzhou University will be established, formed by merging and reorganizing Gansu College, Northwest Normal College, and Northwest Medical College, and will establish colleges of liberal arts, science, and engineering. In addition, to encourage graduates of secondary schools to pursue further education and cultivate various specialized talents, the Regulations for Scholarships for Gansu Students in Domestic Universities and Colleges were established. All students from this province studying at domestic universities or independent colleges will be granted scholarships by the provincial government. The amount of these scholarships has been increasing year by year, and the number of students receiving scholarships has also been increasing year by year, from 54 in the 27th year to 782 in the 34th year, an increase of about 15 times.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>(B) Secondary Education: In the past, secondary schools in Gansu were concentrated in a few cities such as Pingliang, Tianshui, and Lintao, with uneven distribution. The funding for schools in the provincial capital and other counties also varied greatly, with no standard. In the winter of the 27th year, when Mr. Zheng took office, he immediately established a standard for the staffing and budget of secondary schools. The funding for schools in other counties was increased year by year. By the 31st year, all secondary schools in the province were receiving their full allocation according to the standard, eliminating the past problem of uneven distribution and emphasizing the east. Regarding the establishment of new schools and classes, a plan for district-based school expansion and grade increases was formulated. The province was divided into ten middle school and normal school districts: Lanzhou, Lintao, Tianshui, Pingliang, Longxi, Wuwei, Jiuquan, Qingyang, Linxia, and Wudu; and four vocational school districts: Lanzhou, Longnan, Sui Dong, and Hexi. Schools were established year by year in districts with fewer schools or no schools at all, and the number of classes was also increased year by year. The increase in the number of schools, grades, and students over the past seven years is as follows: (27th year) 15 middle schools, 68 grades, 3,103 students; 14 normal schools, 66 grades, 2,523 students; 5 vocational schools, 24 grades, 708 students. (34th year) 59 middle schools, 367 grades, 3,547 students; 23 normal schools, 188 grades, 6,709 students; 15 vocational schools, 95 grades, 2,675 students. Middle schools have developed the fastest, followed by normal schools, with fewer vocational schools being established.</p>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>(C) National Education: The total number of school-age children in Gansu Province is approximately 700,000. According to statistics from the 27th year, only about 150,000 children were enrolled in school, with about 80% of school-age children out of school. After seven years of effort, 825 central national schools have been established, reaching the standard of one school per township. 6,725 protected national schools have been established, with 500 protected areas still without schools, which are scheduled to be established in the 35th year. All central schools and national schools have raised sufficient funds in accordance with regulations since the 30th year. Excluding over-age children, approximately 49% of school-age children in the province have been enrolled in school. Furthermore, adult literacy education is being gradually promoted. For example, national schools in various counties of the Longdong Special Education District have universally established adult education classes. (D) Social Education: Gansu has established four provincial-level people's education halls and one provincial library. Each county has established people's education halls with the exception of a few remote counties. National physical education has also been actively promoted. Every year on Double Tenth Day, sports events are held in various districts throughout the province. Other forms of education, such as broadcasting education and film education, have also been planned and implemented. During the Anti-Japanese War, although the province faced difficult conditions, the education cause was able to develop rapidly, partly due to the efforts of education personnel and partly due to a substantial increase in funding. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the province's education funding ranked only 18th among all provinces, but it has now risen to 6th place. If calculated by population and the multiple of funding increase, it ranks first among all provinces.</p>

<h3>Opening Day at Hongkou Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Hongkou Swimming Pool, eagerly awaited by the citizens, opened yesterday. To avoid overcrowding and inconvenience, there were no opening ceremonies or performances yesterday. A reporter made a special trip to visit in the light rain yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The water was so clean it looked blue. There were only a few dozen people in the pool, about half of whom were foreigners. The desolate scene was not as good as in previous years, probably due to the rain, the cool weather, and the fact that the public was not yet aware that it had opened. There was no loud noise in the men's changing room, and no ladies in colorful swimsuits to add color to the opening day.</p>
<p>It is said that the water filtration system has been completely repaired, so the water can be kept clean for a long time without frequent changes. The capacity of the pool is 3.2 million gallons, and the water cost is about 1.8 million yuan. There will also be a snack bar next to the pool to provide food and drinks for swimmers.</p>
<p>Perhaps we think the ticket price is a bit high, so we might as well hope for hot weather. When it's hot, there will be crowds, and more tickets can be sold, and maybe the price will be reduced.</p>

The trucks will then remove the trash or transport it to a transfer point.</p>
<p>3.  To strive for cleanliness on the streets (including major and minor streets), the cleaning corps will be equipped with one platoon per district (or one squad in suburban areas) based on the size of the area and the population, and will be supervised by the district office, with police, health bureaus, and the cleaning corps providing tiered supervision. Street sweepers will be assigned to specific sections, and street trash will be removed. The garbage in the existing street trash cans and bins will also be removed by the respective cleaning teams; however, broken bricks and soil generated from repairing houses should be removed by the owners themselves. In addition, the sludge generated from dredging rivers should be transported away by the owners or the units undertaking the project.</p>
<p>4.  To remove accumulated garbage, garbage is a breeding ground for flies. At this time of epidemic, it is urgent to remove it in districts and phases to emphasize cleanliness and facilitate epidemic prevention. All accumulated garbage in each district must be investigated by each district office by July 14th of the 35th year, estimating the tonnage and reporting directly to the Environmental Sanitation Department of the Health Bureau in order to plan for unified removal, organize by district, and complete within a time limit. Garbage piles that can ferment and cause flies to breed should be removed first. In order to expedite matters, the preliminary phased garbage removal plan is as follows: First week: West District, Central District, South District (July 16th to 22nd); Second week: Zhabei District, North District, East District (July 23rd to 29th); Third week: Nanshi District, Huxi District (July 30th to August 5th); Regarding the above items 1 and 2, the Bao can be the center, and each Bao can convene a temporary Bao-Min Congress to formulate cleanliness covenants. Regarding the above items 3 and 4, the district office can be the center, and the district chief can convene a Bao-Jia chief meeting to jointly discuss implementation methods.</p>
<p>(3) In order to promote the Cleanliness Zone System to the fullest extent, the Health Bureau should, in accordance with the Municipal Government's decision, invite responsible persons from relevant agencies to form the Shanghai Cleanliness Design Management Committee, the organization of which will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>(4) In order to review and improve cleanliness matters, the Health Bureau may, in conjunction with the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department, convene district chief meetings, and Bao-Jia chiefs may be designated to attend. (5, 6, 7: Omitted)</p>
<h3>Change of District Chief in the Fourth District</h3>
<p>Chen Minshu, the district chief of the Fourth District of this city, recently submitted his resignation due to illness. It has been learned that the Municipal Government has approved it, and Shao Xinshi has been appointed to fill the vacancy. It is noted that Chief Shao is a graduate of the Zhongxun Guodang Government and Political Class, has worked as a newspaper reporter for many years, and has recently served as a commissioner in the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>

<h3>District Bao Staff - Serving as District People's Representatives</h3>
<p>-Must Choose One to Resign-</p>
<p>All district people's representatives in this city have been elected. However, some hold positions as staff in district offices and Bao secretaries. The municipal government believes that while district office staff and Bao secretaries are autonomous personnel, they are responsible for handling daily internal affairs, and serving concurrently as district people's representatives would hinder their primary work. Based on Article 2 of the County Councilors Election Regulations and Item 3 of the Unified Interpretation of the Executive Yuan, they may not serve concurrently as district people's representatives. Those who have been elected should choose one to resign and report to the Ministry of Interior for approval. Yesterday, a telegram from the Ministry of Interior (Ministry of Interior 5 Grey) approved the record.</p>

<h3>Plan to Organize a Commercial Arbitration Association to Promote Trade Between China and the United States: Li Ming and Carson Nominated as Chairmen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to Ms. Shi Fanglan, the China representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, the two countries are currently researching the organization of an arbitration committee for commercial disputes between the two countries to handle all difficulties and disputes that arise in Sino-American trade. She said that recently, the chairman of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association, Mr. Fu'aser, delivered a speech on this matter at the banquet of the American Commercial Arbitration Association. He believed that the establishment of a Sino-American commercial arbitration mechanism would promote friendly commercial relations between the two countries and predicted that the future development of the mechanism would be extremely bright. Historically, Chinese commerce and personal relationships have attached great importance to the spirit of arbitration. Today, the spirit of arbitration is even more important in Chinese commercial, labor, and maritime relations. The first Chinese arbitration regulation was promulgated in 1921 by the Ministry of Justice of the Beijing government, and the regulation was re-examined and approved in 1935 by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government. In addition, China's Commercial Association Law, Labor Law, etc., have detailed provisions for arbitration, so China already has a foundation for arbitration measures in various commercial aspects. Now that the United States has long abandoned extraterritorial rights in China, American businessmen operating in China are subject to Chinese law. However, since the establishment of a new relationship between foreign businessmen and Chinese law, there may be occasional trade disputes, and purely judicial handling may inevitably lead to delays. Therefore, in order to accelerate the resolution of possible commercial disputes between China and the United States, business leaders from both countries should be selected to form a Sino-American Commercial Dispute Arbitration Committee. According to the American Commercial Arbitration Association, in early 1945, the association accepted a request from the US State Department to provide a memorandum, suggesting that a commercial dispute arbitration mechanism should be established in the commercial relationship between China and the United States to handle all possible difficulties or disputes. The proposal was also submitted to the Chinese government for approval, and six leading figures from Chinese banking and commerce were designated to form a delegation to the United States to discuss with twenty leaders from the American business community appointed by the association to promote the organization of a mutually beneficial Sino-American commercial arbitration mechanism. It is learned that Mr. Li Ming of our country and Mr. Carson of the United States have been nominated as chairmen of the organizing committee. The committee is currently planning to establish this arbitration mechanism as soon as possible and is actively drafting all relevant rules and regulations. It is learned that Mr. Wang Renweidun, the international public relations officer of the American Commercial Arbitration Association, will visit China soon to plan for the establishment of the arbitration mechanism in China.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver: Accelerated Gold Flow, Undecided U.S. Silver Price</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th dispatch] World gold is currently moving at an accelerated pace towards several free markets (partly from unexpected sources such as the Bank of England). In some situations, this movement of gold may accelerate further. Significant changes in the U.S. gold reserves are also becoming possible. However, London gold industry figures do not want this gold to flow to India. As for silver, millions upon millions of taels will still flow to China within a few years, it is said.</p>
<p>The Senate previously suggested a compromise on Wednesday to set the silver price at $0.903 per ounce. Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to reject it. The House insists on setting the silver price at $0.7111 per ounce.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Steady, Cotton Fabric Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was relatively stable. Initially, Shuang Ma yarn (Double Horse yarn) was quoted slightly higher, but it returned to 1.29 million at the close. Medium and small-sized yarns, especially those with the "Red Cai" and "Two Kui Stars" brands, were most actively traded, with prices about 10,000 higher than the previous day. Double-ply thread was bought up, with prices rising 20,000, showing strong support. At noon, the Fang Jian Company (Spinning &amp; Construction Company) as usual posted prices for open-end yarn, which were similar to those marked on Wednesday, without much change.</p>
<p>Grey cloth turned soft again because the actual demand was not smooth. At the same time, the Fang Jian Company continued to supply it on the previous day, so people's mood was tired. However, the 3A Cai Qiu (Colorful Ball) fine cloth still saw strong demand in the north and remained firm. The rest generally fell by 500 to 750.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraph, rose again by 29 to 37 points. The spot price of near-term cotton was 33.8 U.S. dollars, the forward price was 34.1 U.S. dollars, and the spot price of middling was 34.56 U.S. dollars. The local cotton spot market was purely affected by the continuous rise in American cotton. People holding goods became more reluctant to sell, resulting in a slight decrease in trading volume. It is said that only Nantong Dasheng and Wuxi Qingfeng yarn factories slightly purchased.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Postpones Tender</h3>
<p>Rumors Say Prices May Fall Slightly</p>
<p>The sixth phase of Taiwan Sugar Company's Taiwan sugar tender was originally scheduled to be held yesterday. However, because the various procedures of the previous phase have not yet been completed, and sugar merchants have sufficient sugar stocks, and the retail stores also do not lack sugar, the company decided to postpone it for three days, setting it for next Monday. As for the tender price, it has also been decided to ensure that the sugar price gradually falls slightly.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Instructs Rice Merchants Not to Refuse to Sell Rationed Rice, Otherwise, Licenses Will Be Revoked; Milling Brown Rice into White Rice is Also Not Permitted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Wu summoned Mr. Qu Zhenhua, the representative of the city's Rice Merchants Association, and was extremely angered by the refusal of various rice shops in the city to sell rationed rice. He verbally instructed Mr. Qu to tell all rice shops that if they again refused to sell rationed rice by making excuses and violating regulations, their licenses would be revoked. Mr. Qu then made some statements regarding the city government's method of requiring advance payment for rationed rice. According to Mayor Wu, if the rice shops have difficulties paying for rationed rice in advance, the Rice Industry Association should submit a request to the city government for approval. Within a possible range, the city government will provide assistance.</p>
<p>The Grain Price Review Committee held its fifth regular meeting yesterday. The meeting decided: (1) the price of white rice will remain unchanged as previously assessed, and (2) the proposals made by rice merchants at the fourth regular meeting regarding paying for rationed rice after it is sold and selling brown rice milled into white rice, except that the first item has been submitted to the mayor for decision, regarding the sale of brown rice milled into white rice, the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to avoid a few rice profiteers milling brown rice into white rice and passing it off as high-quality white rice for sale, decided not to discuss it. Furthermore, the arrival of goods at the north and south rice markets yesterday was relatively sparse, with 534 piculs arriving at the south rice market and 1,776 piculs arriving at the north rice market, and 1,777 piculs and 45 packages were self-transported and sold, totaling 4,088 piculs and 45 packages. Rice is widely available for public sale at rice shops throughout the city.</p>
<p>A small number of rice shops also received and sold subsidized rice yesterday. The Bureau of Social Affairs stipulates that the daily quantity of low-price rice sold should be 5,000 piculs and will try to increase it if necessary.</p>
<h3>Keemun Black Tea Under Negotiation, Local Sales Quite Active</h3>
<p>Regarding tea, the shops and tea firms on this street are still actively stocking up due to the current peak tea season, and transactions are unusually active, but prices are generally stable. As for the foreign firm tea market, the negotiations between the British company Concord Foreign Firm and those holding Keemun aged black tea have shown slight progress in recent days, but no formal agreement has been reached. It is said that the price being discussed is only around 90,000 per dan.</p>
<h3>Yangquan White Coal Will Arrive, Kaiping Slack Coal Extremely Sluggish</h3>
<p>Regarding the coal market, news of the arrival of white coal has been heard. 500 tons of Yangquan white coal are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about a week. However, the market remains slightly firm due to recent low inventories and hoarding by cargo owners. High-grade bituminous coal lump is also continuing to rise in price due to shortages. However, Kaiping No. 2 seam coal is still sluggish, and prices have fallen below the allocated price. The reason is that the supply of fuel coal along the Longhai and Pukou areas is relatively difficult, while the factories in Shanghai are depressed, and factory sales are extremely sluggish. Therefore, those who previously handled coal from East China and Huainan transported it to Pukou, where it was purchased by the Fuel Management Committee and paid to the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee for Kaiping No. 2 seam coal certificates to be delivered in Pudong at 80% of the price, thus further increasing oversupply.</p>
<h3>Promoting Tea Exports, Providing Low-Interest Loans</h3>
<p>Specific Measures Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Tea faces difficulties in export trade due to high costs. The Central Bank plans to provide export loans and has been in discussions with tea merchants for several days. The plan is that tea merchants can pledge overseas customer credit drafts obtained based on overseas orders sold. The bank will only charge tea merchants low interest to help tea merchants circulate funds, without having to wait for the goods to be shipped and paid for, hoping to reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>Caustic Soda: It is heard that another 2,000+ barrels of caustic soda transferred from Hong Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The market price yesterday was 410,000. Purchases from outside the city are extremely rare and the price has a tendency to decline again.</p>
<p>Celluloid: In recent months, the Shanghai market has been flooded with glassware, all marked as newly arrived American goods. It is now heard that these glass products are mostly manufactured by foreigners of a certain country using celluloid. Celluloid sales are now very good, with wholesale prices ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 per pound.</p>
<p>Hard Lead: After the war, large quantities of American goods (4X hard lead) were shipped to China. Later, the American side heard that a certain country was absorbing it at high prices and immediately prohibited exports. It is said that the hard lead contains a major metal component, which, after refining, can be used to manufacture military equipment. The usage in Shanghai has not decreased, and the inventory is decreasing daily, causing the market price to be twice as high as before.</p>
<h3>Refined White Sugar Thrown on the Market and Sold for US$18.75 Per 100 Pounds</h3>
<p>The sugar market was initially stable yesterday and then weakened. The Guild's first-class white granulated sugar from the disk opening was 97,000 to 96,500, 96,000, 95,500 to 94,000 in the afternoon, a small decrease of 3,000 before and after. Wenzhou's medium granulated sugar was only 90,000, warehouse receipts 92,000 to 90,500, 90,000. Half-cars of white sugar were 170,000, three-and-a-half cars of white sugar were 147,000, raw granulated sugar 100,200 to 101,000, later 97,000, a small decrease of 5,000. Goods from the Chaozhou-Guangdong group were offered at 100,500 for cotton red sugar, 80,000 to 79,000 for Huanggang Qing sugar, with a hundred or so bags sold. Goods from the Jian group opened at several dozen bags of Diao Qing sugar for 79,000. Xinghua red sugar was 98,000 to 96,000. It is heard that Peruvian refined white sugar has been thrown on the market and sold for US$18.75 per 100 pounds, excluding taxes, for shipping in July, August, and September.</p>
<h3>Financial Markets Quite Stable</h3>
<p>Demand for Hong Kong Notes Very Strong Yesterday; Foreign Stocks Mostly Cashed Out at High Prices</p>
<p>Raw Silk: Remained stable yesterday, with limited trading and slight fluctuations. After the opening, it hovered around 1.94 million. At 10:00, the Central Bank distributed 70 bars at a price of 1.94 million, at which point it became even more stable. Around noon, it rose slightly from 1.93 million, but did not exceed 1.95 million. The afternoon remained stable, with slightly higher asking prices, resulting in a slight increase of 5,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was 1.06 million, silver bullion 1,800, silver dollars 1,380, there was supply, and the informal interbank lending market remained loose, with interest rates around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies: U.S. dollars remained peaceful, ranging from 2,530 to 2,570 in the morning, only a distance of 40. At noon, it was around 2,550. There were no major changes in the afternoon. The gold market reported higher, showing a slight improvement. The results were slightly down 15 compared to the previous close. There was a strong demand for Hong Kong notes, resulting in a good increase of 10. Due to the influence of the U.S. Congress making a final decision on Anglo-American loans, Anglo-American foreign exchange was generally sold short, resulting in this. Hong Kong exchange rate 545 to 555, Indian exchange rate 670 had sellers, British exchange rate 8,700 to 8,900, US exchange rate still lacked changes.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Gradually became hazy, with fluctuating supply and demand. Unified Class C bonds retreated from 950 in the early morning to 780, hovering around 850 near noon, resulting in a decrease of 120 compared to the previous close. Class A, B, and D also fell by 140, Class E was relatively flat, with only a slight decrease of 90.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Large stocks still showed improvement, while small stocks still felt weak. The market was firm at first and then flat. The highest prices in the early morning were Yongsha 505, Meiya 3050, Jingfu 180, Xinguang 200, and Qinxing 155. The weakest prices midway were Yongsha 475, Meiya 2780, Jingfu 160, Xinguang 180, and Qinxing 140, only hovering near noon, resulting in Yongsha and Meiya still rising slightly compared to the previous close, Jingfu falling slightly, and Xinguang Qinxing flat. In the unpopular middle-sized stocks, there were slight increases, while small-sized stocks had limited increases and decreases due to inconsistent supply and demand. The three old stocks rebounded slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: Rose slightly and fell back. Holders cashed out at high prices. Before the listing of stocks on the exchange, those engaged in foreign stocks are inevitably uneasy. Yisha retreated from 8,400 to 7,500, and then turned around, resulting in Yisha and Huide, the British Union Steel falling by slightly less than half a percent, and the Paper Industry, Asian Beer falling by slightly more than half a percent. Ye Guang was flat.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Relief Obtained from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Information Office</p>
<p>After the extreme destruction of the war, there must be a period of recovery and restoration. With much land laid to waste and people struggling on the brink of death, the recovery work must have a fundamental starting point. To launch this post-war relief and recovery effort, forty-four allied nations signed an agreement on November 9, 1943, establishing the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p>China supported the war for the longest time and suffered the most damage, so its hope for relief is also the most urgent. The Executive Yuan formed a Survey and Design Committee, which, with the assistance of international experts, completed a report estimating that our post-war relief and recovery needs totaled US$2.5 billion and 2.7 billion pre-war purchasing power of legal tender. But we requested US$945 million from UNRRA, with the remainder to be raised by China itself.</p>
<p>China's Post-War Relief and Recovery Needs and Requests to UNRRA</p>
<p>Total Needs (Thousands of Units) | Requested From UNRRA (Thousands of Units)</p>
<p>---|---</p>
<p>Relief Item | Expenses (National Currency) | Supplies (Thousands of Units) | Supplies | Percentage</p>

<p>Total | 2,727,164 | 2,529,677 | 945,046 | 100.0</p>
<p>The above quantity of supplies is in metric tons.</p>
<p>The above value of supplies is in US dollars.</p>
<p>In addition, we requested UNRRA to send more than 2,000 foreign experts, 55% of whom were to restore transportation and agricultural industry and 45% of whom were to handle direct relief work. The above figures are only 37% of what our country needs, with the remaining 63% to be raised by China itself. In addition, administrative expenses of 2.7277 billion must be raised. China also established the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, abbreviated as "Xingzong," under the Executive Yuan. UNRRA also established a China office to cooperate with Xingzong.</p>
<p>The amount of relief China requested from UNRRA was already reduced to the minimum. It was confidently considered to be fair, but the amount UNRRA considered allocating to China was not as substantial as ideally hoped. The Xingzong released a public statement on December 26, 1945, stating that a total of 90,000 tons of supplies had been received. UNRRA China Office Director Kayser declared on May 10, 1946, that 413,395 tons of relief supplies had arrived in Shanghai in string, 128,000 tons for other departments, and 119,671 tons were en route. According to the statement released by Zheng Binnan, director of Xingzong's US office (January 28, 1946, in Shanghai), the relief supplies our country received were too small compared to other countries! (See table below)</p>
<p>Country | Amount of Relief Received (USD) | Average Distribution Per Person (USD)</p>
<p>---|---</p>
<p>Albania | 25,000,000 | 22.42</p>
<p>Austria | 75,000,000 | 11.54</p>
<p>Belarus | 50,000,000 | 3.30</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia | 20,000,000 | 16.56</p>
<p>Greece | 37,500,000 | 52.46</p>
<p>Italy | 40,900,000 | 9.32</p>
<p>Poland | 440,000,000 | 19.37</p>
<p>Yugoslavia | 158,000,000 | 2.13</p>
<p>China | 560,000,000 | 1.25</p>
<p>Although the absolute number looks not small, given China's vast disaster areas and large number of refugees, this huge number is not enough and the proportion is too small.</p>
<p>What is particularly disappointing to us is UNRRA's relief for our country, especially regarding food. Since China's eight-year War of Resistance, people's lives have been unbearable. And the autumn harvests of 1945 and 1946 decreased. In Hunan, known as a rice-producing area, less than one-third of the land was cultivated. The Yellow River flood zone in Henan also could not be cultivated. In other war zones such as Guangxi, Hubei, and Jiangxi, as well as the so-called Communist-liberated areas such as northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, and the Northeast, people all felt impoverished. The disaster area was vast, including eighteen provinces, with 40 million people in urgent need of relief. However, due to severe famine occurring around the world, the amount of food allocated to China was minimal. When Hoover came to China to provide disaster relief, he proposed to UNRRA that the relief goods arriving in China be increased by 200,000 tons per month (including May, June, July, August, and September), but UNRRA only agreed to transport 870,000 tons within five months. At the same time, due to our country's lack of transportation and the dilapidated state of its seaports, the relief supplies could not be quickly transported to the disaster areas, which is also regrettable.</p>
<p>Xingzong's principle is to improve the situation in the disaster area within two years, and at the same time, to replace relief with post-war construction, taking the opportunity to promote industrialization. Its work is divided into handling emergency relief, restoring transportation, improving agriculture, constructing medical administration, and stabilizing finance. Xingzong handles goods by distributing them free of charge to relieve poor people, selling them at fair prices, and selling part of the materials to cover administrative expenses. Doing charity work is inherently difficult. Director-General Jiang has repeatedly stated that staff must be honest and law-abiding. Even so, they will still be subject to criticism.</p>
<p>UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced on July 9 that the shipment of agricultural and industrial equipment to China would be suspended, saying it was based on a joint complaint by more than 300 foreign staff members of UNRRA's China office. The points of complaint are: (1) China has failed to quickly distribute relief supplies to refugees and has used them as a political tool, and (2) the Chinese government does not provide Xingzong's expenses, causing the relief supplies to be sold, depriving countless starving people of the food they need. Our government issued a statement on the 11th, and Director-General Jiang explained this to reporters on the 12th. It is hoped that the UNRRA Director-General will understand the real situation in China and will be able to resume the work of shipping materials to China as usual.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Air Force Group's Trip to Tokyo (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>The first American military radio station within Japan that the plane contacted was Fukuoka. The Fukuoka radio station gave us worry and also gave us trust. The weather within Japan was good after all, and there wouldn't be any more difficulties. After Fukuoka, everyone ate cigarettes and candies. The four girls desperately gave bread and cakes to the passengers. I also thought about the real combat situation, where there cannot be female crew members. The reason is that men are strong and can act like beasts to fight. If there are women in the plane, it will distract the men to protect them. So, if the plane were to go into combat, these four girls' actions of handing out cakes and candies would cause disgust and distract the aircrew. But this flight was different. I saw everyone eating a little chocolate candy, especially Xu Shulin. He was like a liaison officer, managing the entire plane up and down, front and back, constantly needing to pay attention and work. When offered candy during his busy schedule, he immediately responded with a smile and gratitude, while gesturing. Chen Gongmao was different. He needed to stay alert, searching the ether for the radio waves of the American military radio station in order to learn about the weather report for the journey ahead. Sometimes, he had to stimulate the American military radio station by pressing his transmitter key, so his eyes were looking at circles of radio waves, and his ears were listening to "di-di-da" tones. He valued not wanting to eat anything, only hoping to not lose contact.</p>
<p>After passing Osaka, at 2:40, we saw Mount Fuji appear to the left. The clouds capped the lower realm, but the black body of Mount Fuji emerged from the clouds, its peak covered in white clouds. Seeing Mount Fuji meant that it was only fifteen minutes away from the Atsugi Airport in Tokyo. Before seeing Mount Fuji, Captain Wang directed the plane to fly to the right, which was his cautiousness due to old age. At 2:45, we were on the sea of Tokyo Bay. We were all happily pleased to be able to fly on time. Except for Chief Zhu, who had been to Tokyo before, everyone on the plane was visiting for the first time. The driver's seat could be like two main guests sitting in a special car enjoying the scenery outside the car window, calmly enjoying Tokyo Bay below. We, who were riding on the plane, were sitting squeezed in the small cabin, and to see Tokyo Bay, we had to squeeze to the small glass window to look out. Xu Shulin saw that the front upper turret seat was empty, so he beckoned to him. I climbed up. This was a semi-circular glass ball for rearward vigilance. I turned sideways and looked forward. Tokyo Bay was as I imagined it, similar to a shallow beach embracing a line, and further ahead was the land. The sea water was still gray and calm without waves, but the small islands were clearly visible. There was not a single boat or dock, this was a purely natural area. It was here that Japan was intimidated by the earthquake, established coastal fortresses, and finally opened its doors again and surrendered. Tokyo Bay became calm here.</p>
<p>Our plane flew straight towards Mount Fuji, and after landing, we saw a high platform between the Yamada River in Japan, with a yellow, bare color, on which many neatly arranged planes were placed. Our plane flew straight to that airport without hesitation. When I looked from afar, I thought it was a small airport. Only when I looked closely did I know that it was very wide. In the rectangular scene, there was a black runway. The planes arranged on all sides were colorful and countless. There were all kinds of styles. This was truly a demonstration of military power. From the single-engine Mustang, to the twin-engine P88 reconnaissance plane on the aircraft body, to the same type of black P67 Black Widow night monitoring plane, B25, B24, C54, C46, all kinds of aircraft were available.</p>
<h3>Small Farmer Fortresses Gradually Being Established</h3>
<p>The airplane landed on the black asphalt runway, and near the end, there was a taxiway turning to the left. A small jeep, with a sign painted on the back that read "Follow Me" and a yellow flag stuck next to the driver. Our massive sea whale obediently followed this small jeep, taxiing and taxiing. I saw many airplanes being repaired in the hangars outside the taxiway. American soldiers sitting at the entrances of the hangars shielded their eyes from the glaring sunlight with their hands on their hat brims, observing this newly arrived fat fellow. Americans live amidst numerous things; every day, their time and energy are spent accepting stimuli and working. Their straightforward character is greatly related to gaining fresh stimulation from living in flowing water.</p>
<p>After we got off the plane, we felt how hot Atsugi Airport was. The Americans who came to greet Commander Zhu Shiming and the delegation members left one after another in vehicles. Battalion Commander Wang was still waiting for Xu Shulin to pack up the plane and assist the American military in refueling the plane, which held two thousand eight hundred gallons of fuel (sixty large barrels). The Americans did not pay attention to any formalities; they used a fuel truck to refuel the plane, without even requiring a signature. What a magnanimous national spirit! I thought, only those who have interacted with them would feel this.</p>
<p>After we finished packing up the plane, we took two cars into the city. The driver was a middle-aged Japanese man wearing a green serge suit and a soft white hat, named Kanatani Takashi. He had a kind and gentle face, spoke in a soft tone, and his movements were respectful. He said that Captain Liu had also taken his car last time and has now returned to Chongqing. The Japanese are so confused, not understanding that the Chinese government has long since moved back to Nanjing. The last time Captain Liu Shanben came, he has now returned to his country, and the Japanese still remember these things so respectfully, always placing the Chinese in a highly regarded position in their minds. From this point, we felt that coming to Tokyo, everywhere we would suffer the white eyes of the Japanese, although this is an overestimation.</p>
<p>The car traveled on the highway from Atsugi to Tokyo. This road was lined with farmland and villages, densely populated. Xu Shulin said to Huang Eryi: This is simply the scenery of the countryside of Chengdu, Sichuan. The farming in the fields, like in China, is done by hand, planting taro, rice, and wheat piece by piece. It was already approaching evening, and Japanese women and children in the fields were digging mud or weeding. On the highway, Japanese men pushed small carts transporting some wood, sweating as they progressed through the dust. Besides planting food crops in the fields, barren land was always densely covered with pine forests. Wooden houses and small bungalows nestled close to the forest. The scenery did not show that this place had been through war. Especially near the small rivers, seeing Japanese children playing in the water and old people fishing with rods made me, coming from China, envious and sad. Japan was defeated, but its people were relieved of the task of bloodshed and could strive for improvement in clothing, food, and housing. We won, but our people are still wearing military uniforms and firing guns, or are displaced.</p>
<p>On the road from Atsugi to Tokyo, all we saw was a scene of national peace and prosperity. In the Japanese countryside, there were few signs of war. Perhaps the most noticeable thing was that there were fewer men, because many soldiers from the Japanese countryside died in the wars from Guadalcanal to the Ryukyu Islands. And many strong young men also died when the major Japanese cities were bombed. But since the Japanese have already settled down, those who died are dead, and the living naturally have to be busy eating and living well. The Allied forces' economic policies towards Japan struck at the control and bloodsucking of financial capital forces over the rural areas. The damage inflicted by the big bloodsuckers has disappeared in the Japanese countryside. A stable and prosperous small farmer fortress will be gradually established and enriched. That scenery is even more remarkable.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugees Demand to Return Home</h3>
<p>Some time ago, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang visited Jieyang and addressed the refugees, saying that a decision had been made to send you back home, so please be patient (this was during the 15-day ceasefire period). On the 29th of last month, Director Xue of Xuzhou, at a welcoming meeting for Minister Gu, instructed the heads of party and government in various counties to organize the refugees from that day onwards and prepare to return home at any time. Now that the ceasefire period has expired and passed, there has been no response. Moreover, the declaration of Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, regarding the conditions proposed by our government, not only said that they were not satisfied with them, but also called them unreasonable demands. His arrogant attitude is infuriating, and he clearly denied that the Communist army would withdraw from northern Jiangsu, indicating that they could not consider or accept the withdrawal of troops and political power from northern Jiangsu, Rehe, and other places. This resolute tone indicates an intention to occupy northern Jiangsu for a long time. Their lack of sincerity in seeking peace is already obvious. However, the national economy and people's livelihood cannot be delayed any longer, which is recognized by people across the country. If the government is determined to rescue the countless refugees, seeing this terrible situation of deep water and scorching fire, there should be emergency measures. It is hoped that the government will fulfill its promise to send us back home, to maintain its credibility and appease the public (Representatives of refugees from various counties in exile in Yangzhou: Qi Cheng, Zheng Yi, Qi Shuxiang, Jin Mingxin).</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>White-Clad Angel</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>It seems that since that time, I exchanged a few letters with Mei Qi. But it can be said that it was entirely for "fun," simply treating him as a child and joking with him. I also sent him a photo of myself, but it was just for fun, certainly not to keep as a memento.</p>
<p>Later, because a group of older, bad students at Xiguang Middle School were spreading rumors about me, I stopped joking with Mei Qi.</p>
<p>After about three or four years, I had left school. I once again met an old classmate from Mei Qi's hometown. She told me that Mei Qi's parents had both passed away, and he was no longer studying. He was learning to be a laboratory technician at a hospital. She also said that the boy was still very glib and was pursuing a nurse at the hospital who was two or three years older than him, named Xu Xiangying. The two were about to get engaged.</p>
<p>After hearing the news from that classmate, I smiled faintly and soon forgot about it.</p>
<p>It wasn't until a few years after the outbreak of the war that I vaguely heard some news about Mei Qi again. I learned that he had gone to the interior to study with someone. His fiancée, Xu Xiangying, did not go and was working as a nurse at a major hospital in Beiping, and was very successful, etc.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, looking at that commemorative album, I almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>Everything was clear and bright: She was Xu Xiangying. She had found my photo in Mei Qi's broken box, saw my name, and kept it firmly in her mind, thinking that I was some old flame of Mei Qi's.</p>
<p>Turning off the lamp, I breathed a long sigh in the dim moonlight, silently thinking about how to explain this misunderstanding to Xu Xiangying the next day.</p>
<p>But by the next afternoon, Xu Xiangying still hadn't come to my room. After asking around, I learned that she was the newly appointed night shift head nurse, sleeping during the day and getting up to work only at night. So I waited anxiously until night. Sure enough, after the night was quiet, she came again. However, she didn't wait for me to explain, just gave me a mysterious and terrifying smile, asked, "How are you?" and took the commemorative album from beside my pillow, quietly walking out.</p>
<p>After that, she did this almost every night, not giving me a chance to explain, just giving me a mysterious and terrifying smile and leaving.</p>
<p>"Is a woman's heart so narrow?" I almost forgot that I was a woman, and I began to feel somewhat indignant.</p>
<p>But just then, many idle words were spread from the mouths of some young nursing students. They said that Xu Xiangying sent an airmail letter to her fiancé every day; that two-thirds of her monthly salary was remitted to her fiancé as tuition; that she would rather not sleep, working day and night to knit wool sweaters for her fiancé!…</p>
<p>Of course, idle talk is not necessarily reliable. But because of those idle words, I seemed to have a little understanding of Xu Xiangying's mysterious and terrifying coldness. I understood: the more fervent a woman's love, the more intense her jealousy and suspicion. There was no way around it.</p>
<p>"No need to explain, let her be!" Unable to find a chance, I finally smiled faintly and stopped paying attention to her.</p>
<p>But I myself don't remember how many days passed. In short, it seemed to be winter, near Christmas, on a quiet night, Xu Xiangying, who had had appendicitis surgery and was sleeping in the bed opposite mine, gently called my name and said to me:</p>
<p>"Do you know why I specifically wanted to sleep in your room this time I had surgery? I wanted to find a chance to talk to you, because I'm leaving soon!"</p>
<p>"Are you going to the interior?" Remembering what she had told me the first night, I wasn't surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, going to the interior. But I have chronic appendicitis, and I was afraid it would flare up on the road, so I had it removed in advance. At the same time, I can also take this opportunity to talk to you...." She didn't go on, but turned her head to look at me, her eyes gentle, but with suspicion and pain in the gentleness. I knew that this opportunity should not be missed. So I got up and walked gently to her bedside, very frankly and simply telling her about the relationship between Mei Qi and me.</p>
<p>I knew that she believed that I hadn't lied to her, because after listening, she nodded and reached out to hold my hand. But suddenly, I noticed two teardrops hanging from the corner of her eye. She was crying!</p>
<p>Perhaps tears are the most useless things in the world. But tears can also occasionally be like a sudden rain, washing away the barriers between people. She cried, but that mysterious and terrifying thing in her eyes also disappeared.</p>
<p>"I believe you. But I dare not believe Mei Qi. Some people say that he has someone else in the interior..." After wiping away her tears, she looked at me and said half a sentence. Her voice was sincere, and her eyes were also sincere.</p>
<p>That's how we understood each other. In the short two weeks, I got to know Xu Xiangying a lot. I felt that although she was a modern miss, her personality was very much like an ancient chaste woman. Her love was single-minded and unchanging. She showed me a few letters written to her by a young doctor in Beiping, the words very sincere and touching. But she gave me a sad smile and said, "I have already loved Mei Qi, and no man can move my heart!" I also felt that her love for Mei Qi was a kind of almost maternal love. She treated Mei Qi like a son, pitying him, taking care of him, knowing that he was somewhat glib and unreliable, but not blaming him, saying, "There must be some bad woman tempting him, so I have to go and see him no matter what!" Hearing these words, I felt moved and embarrassed.</p>
<p>As Christmas approached, the stitches on Xu Xiangying's stomach were removed, and she was able to get up and walk around. So she planned to set off for the interior as soon as the new year began. But at that time, Mei Qi sent a letter, roughly saying that he needed two shirts, and the cloth in the interior was very expensive, etc. So she became very busy.</p>
<p>It had snowed, and the weather was terribly cold, and the wound on her stomach had not completely healed. But for several nights in a row, I woke up from my dream and saw her still sitting on the bed, wearing a white silver fox coat, her head drooping, sewing shirts for her lover. So I remembered that painting in her commemorative album. In the dim green light, I seemed to see a white-clad angel, standing on the clouds, spreading her arms and looking down on the earth.</p>
<p>I remember it was January 20, 1940. She left. When she left, she asked me to write a few words in her commemorative album to leave as a memento. So I wrote these two sentences:</p>
<p>"My friend,</p>
<p>My most admired white-clad angel,</p>
<p>May you be happy!"</p>
<p>She left. On the arduous journey, she still didn't forget me and sent two letters. But after those two letters, she never sent any more letters. Because I didn't know her address, I had no way to send letters to her. Of course, I could still hear some scattered news about her. Some said that she had gotten married, some said that she had developed lung disease, and some said that she had become a nun. It seemed that all the news was unreliable, so I didn't dare to believe any of it.</p>
<p>However, reliable news finally came. Last winter, a friend who came out of the interior to see me said to me, "Do you know? Mei Qi's fiancée, Xu Xiangying, committed suicide!"</p>
<p>"Why did she commit suicide?" I was so frightened that I trembled all over.</p>
<p>"Of course, for Mei Qi!" The friend quietly answered me. "That little rascal didn't really love her in the first place. He recently graduated from college, doesn't need her money anymore, so he abandoned her!"</p>
<p>That day was the winter solstice festival. Hearing this news, I felt indescribable grief and sadness. Just then, my fellow patient Li Shan and her newly acquainted boyfriend Mr. Lu came, and I told them about this matter. Li Shan listened and smiled indifferently: "Xu Xiangying was too stupid! I say that such a woman is suffering the consequences of her own actions and should die! Do you think so?"</p>
<p>Is it right?… I knew maybe it was right! But I didn't answer Li Shan, just quietly stood up and walked to the window, facing the vast sky, silently shouting:</p>
<p>"My friend,</p>
<p>My most admired white-clad angel,</p>
<p>May you rest in peace forever!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Stillness</h3>
<p>— Lan Ge</p>
<p>Stillness has an unspeakable, profound meaning.</p>
<p>The gentle flowing water in the stream; the ever-changing clouds in the sky; a gust of breeze in the pine forest; the bark of a dog in the fields; a bee among the flowers; the crow of a rooster in the morning; the cry of a crow in the evening; the sound of a chime in an ancient temple; and a row of tree shadows under the moonlight… These are all the conditions that make up stillness.</p>
<p>Because without noise, there is no stillness. So stillness is produced by the slight changes in the emptiness and tranquility. It gives people a transcendent image and heightened senses.</p>
<p>When night falls on the earth, stillness absorbs all the noise of the earth. At that time, the bark of a dog in the wilderness is stillness, the cry of an owl in the forest is stillness. Stillness makes the surrounding air light, but it also makes the air tense. In the lightness of stillness, we will give all the troubles of our hearts to the desolate and tranquil air; in the ups and downs of reality, we will think of some past dreams and vague hopes for the future. At that time, we are happy, we are relaxed. But in the tension of stillness, we seem to have plunged our hearts into the dark abyss, everything is difficult and terrifying, forgetting the past dreams, and not thinking about the bright hopes for the future, but facing the terrifying reality with shocking and disappointing tremors.</p>
<p>We will also secretly explore our past behaviors in the air of stillness, so that our calm hearts can receive a little comforting encouragement and repentance for sins. Because only stillness is the best mirror that allows us to clearly look back on the past; the so-called "reflecting on mistakes at midnight" is also said in conjunction with stillness.</p>
<p>Chekhov said: "We should wait until we have calmed down before we can write!" Stillness is indeed the best water filter to clarify our emotions and correct our rationality. For those who do not have a moment of quiet time to let them ponder carefully, their emotions are dangerous - their pens are also dangerous.</p>
<p>People who live in the hustle and bustle of reality, you can be quiet for a while. The whole era is turbulent and disturbing, but there is always a place and a moment in time that can allow you to think quietly and review honestly. We know that a quiet world cannot be built without a calm and rational heart!</p>

<h3>Double Flight, Double Abode 83</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Brigade Commander "Dry Father" was a regular customer at a restaurant, so he often brought Lihua to this restaurant. He also constantly sent banquets to Lihua's residence to entertain her. Brigade Commander "Dry Father" had a trimmed Japanese-style mustache and was tall and fat. Lihua, in his presence, was like a chick in front of a tiger. Therefore, when Lihua saw him, she was as afraid as a mouse seeing a cat, but she had no choice but to hold her nose and humor him.</p>
<p>One day, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" invited Lihua to dinner, saying that after dinner he would take her to the theater. Usually, Lihua was always accompanied by Mrs. Mo wherever she went. This time, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" did not allow Mrs. Mo to go with her. Mrs. Mo felt that she was with "Dry Father," so she was very relieved and did not accompany Lihua. As a result, Lihua became even more afraid. Upon arriving at the restaurant, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" had already prepared a beautiful private room, with no other guests, only Lihua herself. At this time, Lihua began to mutter to herself, but she couldn't leave immediately. Brigade Commander "Dry Father" ordered a lot of wine and dishes, and diligently looked after Lihua, but Lihua couldn't eat anything.</p>
<p>"Lihua, Dry Father really likes you. How about you follow Dry Father starting tomorrow?" Brigade Commander "Dry Father" said to Lihua with a smile while drinking wine.</p>
<p>"That's outrageous!" Lihua thought to herself. She understood that the word "follow" was not meant in a good way. But she didn't say anything, only smiled.</p>
<p>"Say it! Say whether you are willing to follow Dry Father?" the "gentleman" Dry Father pressed.</p>
<p>"No!" Lihua shook her head and said. "I want to be with Mom!" Lihua couldn't think of a suitable answer in that sudden moment.</p>

<h3>Sincerity</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>"Great deceit resembles trustworthiness, great treachery resembles loyalty, outward appearance shows simplicity, inner self hides cunning deception; arrogant and disrespectful to superiors, secretive and harmful to others."</p>
<p>Reading the above sentences from Lü Hui's memorial impeaching Wang Anshi in the History of the Song Dynasty, I had many thoughts. First, Wang Anshi was very influential at the time and deeply favored by Emperor Shenzong. A minor remonstrator actually had such courage. Second, deceit as trustworthiness, treachery as loyalty, simplicity as outward appearance, cunning deception—this set of logic is not entirely unfounded and does have some truth to it. Third, people's views, or political opinions, are often difficult to understand, and "wrongness" seems to have its own "theoretical basis."</p>
<p>Taking Wang Anshi as an example, he was indeed a political reformer and not an extreme villain. His reforms, such as the Young Crop Loan System, were not necessarily intended to benefit the country and the people. As for the merits, demerits, achievements, and crimes, posterity will have its own judgment, so I won't discuss them here.</p>
<p>The most important quality for a politician is sincerity. Only with sincerity can one gain trust. Today, people like to talk about tactics and strive for promotion, often trapping themselves.</p>
<p>The current social atmosphere can be described as "I deceive you, and you deceive me." Everyone is using deception, and this phenomenon is more dangerous than any other danger. If people are constantly scheming against each other and cannot trust each other, what kind of world will it become?</p>
<p>Not only that, society is also rewarding fraud. As a result, good people and honest people are gradually decreasing, while friends with "gimmicks" are becoming more and more numerous, which is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>The sultry heat is oppressive, and I have some thoughts after reading the History of the Song Dynasty. I'm just rambling on for a few lines, knowing that it's incoherent, but I don't care, and it's hard to care.</p>
<h3>Beware of Black Glasses!</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and black glasses are popular again. Moreover, this year, they are even more "American-equipped," fashionable plus fashionable, truly "top-notch, top-notch." What's more, so-called modern people even wear black glasses in winter.</p>
<p>However, being fashionable is one thing, and health is another. Perhaps modern men and women are willing to sacrifice their health to pursue fashion. However, anyone with reason must be more cautious and think more. I hope everyone will read Professor George Keith's article in "Health Magazine": "Beware of Black Glasses!"</p>
<p>The United States sells about 20 million pairs of black glasses every year. Of course, everyone is buying black glasses to make their eyes more comfortable and to protect their eyesight. However, the number of people suffering from eye inflammation, eye swelling, and eye rot in the United States increases every summer. Many of these people have blind spots in their eyes. A famous ophthalmologist said, "Wearing black glasses to increase eye comfort is unreliable. As for protecting eyesight, in most cases, it doesn't do anything."</p>
<p>Solar radiation is composed of several different types of light, including visible light, as well as invisible ultraviolet and infrared light (heat light). Cheap black glasses, like smoked or tinted lenses, can reduce the glare of the sun, but they cannot completely absorb the invisible, harmful light from the sun.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the pupils contract enough to allow sufficient light to reach the retina behind the eyeball, creating a clear image. However, black glasses weaken the visible light from the sun, causing the pupils to dilate and exposing the sensitive interior of the eye.</p>
<p>The eyes are naturally able to adapt to small amounts of ultraviolet and infrared light. Some ophthalmologists even believe that small amounts of ultraviolet and infrared light are beneficial to the eyes. However, too much ultraviolet light can cause conjunctivitis. Some longer ultraviolet rays enter the lens of the eyeball from the cornea, producing fluorescence and damaging normal vision.</p>
<p>Infrared light is even more harmful! If you stare directly at the sun and then lower your head, you will see a black spot, even when your eyes are closed. This is the afterimage of the sun, and infrared light causes minor damage to the cornea. If you look at the sun for too long—even while wearing black glasses—the persistent black spot may permanently damage your vision. Even with black glasses, the inner membrane of the eye has been burned into a black spot by infrared light.</p>
<p>Even ordinary colorless lenses can absorb small amounts of ultraviolet light, so any black glasses can partially resist ultraviolet radiation. However, doctors warn everyone that cheap black glasses generally do not adequately protect eyesight and are unreliable. These inferior black glasses are ordinary lenses that are tinted with several metal fumes.</p>
<p>Dr. Tang, a professor of ophthalmology at New York University, said, "From a scientific standpoint, the best black glasses can absorb ultraviolet and infrared light and evenly absorb a portion of the seven types of light in the sun."</p>
<p>Good black glasses are made from ground lenses. They can absorb ultraviolet and infrared light, reducing visible light to a comfortable level.</p>
<p>Regarding the color of sunglasses, some advocate green, while others advocate green-yellow, because they do not cause color illusions. This is even more important when driving. Some colors, such as dark amber, often make it difficult for people wearing black glasses to distinguish red and green lights, which can cause accidents.</p>
<p>Dr. Tang summarized the opinions of American ophthalmologists on black glasses. They all advocate that black glasses must be ground and should only be worn in strong sunlight. Fifty percent of the experts believe that wearing black glasses when not in strong sunlight is harmful.</p>
<h3>I Love Doctors</h3>
<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>——After reading "I'm Afraid of Hospitals"</p>
<p>After reading the article "I'm Afraid of Doctors" in "Free Talk" on the 9th, many thoughts welled up in my heart, and I really wanted to talk "freely" about it.</p>
<p>"The duty of medicine is to serve humanity. Other professions also serve society. Farmers provide food, merchants sell supplies, and lawyers protect human rights. They are all doing their best for humanity. However, the doctor's profession not only satisfies one or a few needs of society, but he is concerned with the entire happiness of human life. Every kind of disease endangers life. A small sore can lead to death, and every disease is dangerous. The doctor is the rescuer. Therefore, the importance of his duty can only be compared with another helper of mankind—the pastor. Doctors and pastors come from the same source." This is what Dr. Sigerist of the United States said. My thoughts are completely in line with his.</p>
<p>The symbol of medicine is a bright red cross. The white background and red cross can be seen everywhere in hospitals. Due to the connection of thoughts, people recall the cross in Christianity. Under the banner of freedom of belief, doctors, even if they do not believe in Christ, should at least have the great spirit of Christ to heal patients; because medicine is also a cross—love, sacrifice, compassion. The doctor's goal should not be money, otherwise he cannot be considered a good doctor. He is just a "merchant" who knows medicine. The merchant's mind is focused on money, but the doctor's object is definitely not these, only "life" is the doctor's requirement.</p>
<p>Merchants sell retail goods to others or hoard them without selling. Although it can cause people to suffer losses, the losses are limited. Perhaps there are ways to remedy them. However, in medicine, even the slightest mistake can kill the patient, and there is absolutely no way to remedy it. There may be room for appeals against court decisions, but the disasters caused by the doctor's negligence cannot be restrained. Medicine directly affects personal health and life, and indirectly concerns the happiness of society, the country, and all of humanity. From this, we can see the doctor's responsibility and mission. If all the doctors today were to withdraw from the crowd and let diseases ravage and destroy humanity, what kind of fate would the people of this world face?</p>
<p>Why do some people say, "People are afraid of doctors"? Should doctors be feared? No, absolutely not; here I must explain the definition of "doctor." In China, there are many people who call themselves "doctors," and others also call them "doctors," but they have not received adequate medical education and training. At the same time, they become "doctors" for the same reason they pursue other professions, to make a living. The reason why the doctor's position in Chinese society has not reached the theoretical level is because the doctors themselves lack knowledge and morality (medical ethics). Therefore, doctors not only fail to save people but also kill them. This kind of doctor (note that he is not an ideal doctor) is of course to be "feared." Therefore, doctors must enrich their knowledge and pay attention to medical ethics!</p>
<p>Diseases destroy human beings, taking away their innate happiness and joy. Diseases disrupt the normal rhythm of life. Due to the lack of sanitation facilities and doctors, and the naivety of public knowledge, how many people die unjustly every year? Many remote areas cannot find "traditional Chinese medicine practitioners," and there are very few "doctors" in towns and villages. Even in big cities, due to the poor social system and economic constraints, some poor people do not have money to see a doctor once they get sick, and they let the disease make the final decision.</p>
<p>In short, improving medicine is an urgent task for China today. To have a strong country, we must first have a strong people. Dare I ask, is a person with profound knowledge and a noble character but without a healthy body beneficial to the country and the nation? In this way, the importance of medicine is self-evident.</p>
<p>We hope that the social system can be improved so that people do not lose the opportunity to receive treatment due to insufficient economic conditions. At the same time, we also hope that those who become doctors will truly serve patients!</p>
<p>Finally, I say, "I love doctors!"</p>
<h3>"Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners"</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in the evening, I took tram number one in the old British Concession because I had some official business. Because there were few passengers at the time, the ticket seller had time to chat with a few of them, gradually talking about the ticket seller's skimming of fares. The ticket seller seemed very pleased about this matter. Finally, one of the passengers asked him what kind of passengers he wouldn't skim fares from.</p>
<p>"Haha! We adhere to the 'Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners' principle!" the ticket seller said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Indeed! This term was too novel. At the time, because I was curious, I asked him to explain what he meant, that is, I asked him what the "Don't Cheat Three Kinds of Foreigners" principle was!</p>
<p>"First, don't cheat those who wear Western clothes, because although people who wear suits don't say a word in front of us, they often cause trouble when the ticket inspector comes, at worst scolding us and deducting our salary, at worst breaking our rice bowl. To be cautious, we believe that those who wear Western clothes cannot be cheated. Second, don't cheat foreigners, because if we cheat foreigners, being scolded to our face is considered lenient punishment. The harmful ones will copy down the number and report it to the company, and breaking our rice bowl is inevitable. Therefore, we don't cheat foreigners out of a single cent. Third, don't cheat 'yangpans' (a colloquial term for country bumpkins), because one day one of our colleagues cheated a 'yangpan' out of money and told the 'yangpan,' 'When the ticket inspector comes, say you got on at the racetrack.' It just so happened that when they arrived at the racetrack, a ticket inspector came up and asked him for his ticket, asking him, 'Where did you get on?' 'The racetrack.' 'How long have you been on?' 'A long time.' At the time, the ticket inspector realized that the words didn't match, and the cheating was real, so he gave the ticket seller a major demerit. Therefore, don't cheat 'yangpans,' lest you overreach yourself!"</p>
<p>The ticket seller's long talk made me chuckle, because this was a laughable and ridiculous matter.</p>

<h3>To My Deceased Wife Feng Jun (5)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>I was busy for more than an hour. Thank goodness, with the help of Dr. Wu's heart stimulant and saline injection, I finally saved you. I had seen you open an eye, and I had heard you open your mouth once, but your tongue was stiff and I couldn't hear what you were saying. Afterward, you fell asleep as if you were going to sleep. Dr. Wu saw that there was nothing more for him to do, said goodbye and left, promising to come again tomorrow morning at seven or eight o'clock. Little Qing comforted me for a while and then also went back. I was still not very relieved. I sat in the armchair beside the bed, accompanying you. I sent my nephew, Xiao Xi, back to sleep, but Bao Mei and Mother Ye were startled and scared away their drowsiness, so they stayed up with me.</p>
<p>When the sky was bright and the birds were chattering in the garden, you were still sleeping soundly, snoring softly and not waking up. Our six eyes were fixed on your pale face, anxious as anything. After eight o'clock, Dr. Wu still hadn't arrived, so I hurriedly called Shi Jing to urge him. It wasn't until after nine o'clock that Dr. Wu hurried over. He put the thermometer under your armpit and said that your body temperature was normal. He listened to your heart again and said that your heart was also keeping normal. He took your pulse again and said that your pulse was also beating slower than last night. Then why were you still unconscious? Had the lung disease reached your brain? I voiced this terrible speculation, and Dr. Wu said that it was possible, but once it reached this point, there was no saving you. After he left, leaving a pre-written prescription, we were thrown back into the depths of despair. I forced my tired eyes to look at you, hoping that you would suddenly wake up, but one or two hours quickly passed and you were still snoring softly, seeming to be sleeping soundly. In desperation, I wrote a letter to Senior Zou Jingpu, describing what happened last night and asking him to make a long-distance phone call to Shanghai to summon Zheng'er and Ling'er, brother and sister, back. I immediately called Shi Jing to send it to Zou's residence in Ma Yike, and I also gave him the prescription to get medicine from the Guanqian Pharmacy and bring it back. For the sake of emphasis, I also called Xiao Xi to the telegraph office to send an urgent telegram to Zheng'er, saying, "Mother is in danger, immediately return to Suzhou with Ling!"</p>
<p>The weather, like human affairs, was unpredictable. Suddenly, a strong wind began to blow. At noon, I forced myself to eat half a bowl of rice as if I were swallowing lead bullets. Bao Mei and Mother Ye hadn't slept all night, so they went to rest. I was alone in the room with you, standing by the window listening to the wind. It was blowing the tall plane trees and the dense bamboo forest, as if ten thousand horses were galloping. I was terrified. I looked up at the sky and silently prayed for you, hoping that the wind would blow my prayers up to heaven for God to hear, hoping that the wind would blow in through the window and onto your bed to wake you up.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing like crazy, blowing, blowing. My heart was extremely agitated, and I ran into the garden as if I were going crazy. I saw the sun shining brightly and no one around, except for the roaring wind and no other sounds. I inexplicably circled around and returned to your bedside, only to see that you were still lying there motionless and had not woken up. No matter how many times I called your name, you always ignored me. The tall grandfather clock in the corner struck three times. It was hard on the kind-hearted Mr. Zou Jing, who, at the age of seventy-four, braved the strong wind to come. The old gentleman tightly held my hand, comforted me a few words, walked to the bed to look at you, and then said to me sadly, "Your wife seems to be in her last moments. You must restrain your grief and prepare her." I could only cry and choke, and I couldn't say a word. He and Bao Mei discussed funeral clothes and coffins, and in a moment, they had decided everything in an orderly manner and volunteered to prepare them for me. You can imagine how uncomfortable I was at this time. It was as if I had been sentenced to death. I just sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at you, listening to your snoring and the heavy sound of the pendulum clock echoing each other.</p>
