<h3>司使吳張分返首都　五人小組明日開始會談　議題僅限共黨府委名額</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕司徒雷登大使二日午十一時半由滬取機返抵京，即赴使館休息，下午僅外出一次，無政治方面活動，大使原期待自牯嶺返京之吳鐵城，張厲生先作非正式小組會開幕前之晤談，旋以吳·張兩氏於午後始抵京，故改定三日晨十時邀兩氏至使館會晤，交換意見。又周恩來一日夜在滬曾有電話致大使，擬搭專機返京，二日晨復有電話吿以因事暫緩，唯三日上午決可抵京，大使已預定與周氏會晤時間爲三日下午四時，正式會談定四日在大使館揭幕。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕吳秘書長鐵城，張部長厲生，次長洪蘭友，二日下午五時聯袂自牯返京，記者晚間訪吳氏於其私邸，吳正坐院中納凉，手持芭蕉扇，與記者談話時，語氣平靜，一如對目前時局之態度，據稱：本人此次與張部長赴牯，係爲非正式小組會議事，向主席有所請示，並盼此項會議能及早召開，茲已決定三日上午與司徒大使見面，作會前之交換意見，其次吾人對馬·司兩氏對國共和平商談之調處努力·至爲感動。末並表示，此次會議主題，當爲改組國府委員會一事，因此不啻爲一切問題之總鑰，如能對此主題獲得良好協議，則其他當可迎刃而解。因目前國民黨爲在朝黨，其他黨派在野，如國府委會改組完成，則各黨各派均在朝，大家均可以主人態度處理一切問題。記者詢其對此次會議看法如何，吳氏稱：吾人以極大之信心，希望獲得協議，認爲此項會議必有良好結果。記者再詢以共產黨方面對外之論調，强調國府改組後立即停戰不能獲有保證及政府不撤回五項要求，則此項會議亦徒托空言，不卜尊意如何，吳氏稱：余甚盼其不必堅持。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕記者二日晚訪張部長厲生，據稱：此次在牯，主席召見三次，主席對非正式小組會議之指示，認爲若干問題已經政協決定，僅爲實施間題，國府委員名額，亦已有所決定，即府委名額四十席中，國民黨佔其半，，目前商談者，僅爲其他黨派名額之分配。此次會議，將以此爲唯一課題，並盼大家多爲國家民族前途着想，則和平自立可實現，如有其他問題提出，實已超出原議題以外，極盼不再牽涉太多。同時表示在此項會議未芷式召開前，不願發表任何意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕吳秘長鐵城談：五人小組乃係專爲討論改組國府委會問題而設，故議題範圍僅限於討共論黨參加政府委員會之名額問題，並不涉及其他。吳氏繼稱：自政協會議閉幕後，因各黨派參加政府之名額問題未獲協議，並迄未提出名單，因此，國府委會之改組未能實現，同時，各黨派之國大代表名單亦未提出，致國大延期，故就過去經驗以觀，將來五人小組之討論關於國府名單之分配問題，實難免有爭論與困難，但邇來各方似已有一認識，即假定國府之改組早已實現，各黨各派代表均已參加政府，並負責解決各項問題，則中國之局面或已此今日爲佳。現各方對於進行商談改組政府問題，均表示並不反對，倘大家相見以誠，則縱使有若干困難，亦可望獲得解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕頃據共產黨代表團發言人稱：周恩來對於非正式小組會議之態度，並不樂觀。並謂，前提兩項意見，必須於該項會議前謀取解決，吾則將不能談其他任何問題。</p>

<p>〔本報北平三日電〕甘五小組二日下午四時半訪問十一戰區長官孫連仲，徵詢對安平事件解決意見，孫氏表示，安平事件發生，對中美友誼殊屬不幸，甚願小組早日完成調查工作，求得公平合理解決，旋孫氏以公忙辭出，囑副參謀長高松元，第五行政區專員黃任材代爲答覆小組詢問。高氏曾鄭重答覆馬丁上校詢問，七二九事件，確無國軍參加，美軍亦無協助國軍情事。二日詢問中，對於安平是否爲解放區問題，高氏稱：勝利後冀東香河，寳抵皆爲國軍區域，一一三停戰令後，共軍於甘八日攻陷香河，冀省府及長官部曾請執行部調處·未獲結果·一月甘八日後，香河縣屬即被迫撤北運河以西，偶而共軍亦渡運河，向西搜索物資，長官部爲保障平津公路安全，亦常派軍梭巡，美軍軍輛更經常通過·六月二日駐安平鎭之香河保警大隊，因房屋調整訓練關係，始調往石槽。高氏最後稱：在國軍警備區內，並非每一地經常駐軍，故不能以國軍未駐兵即稱之爲解放區。第五區專員黃任材稱：香河爲勝利後五區接收縣份之一，十二月甘六日，香河縣長班長儒即到縣城，自偽縣長手中接收縣政，本年一月經半月之戰爭，共軍始將香河攻陷，班長儒乃率地方團隊撤往安平。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本簽降一周年</h3>
<p>去年今日，在東京灣美艦米蘇里號甲版上所演出的日本簽降一幕，是人類史上一個重要的轉捩點。從那時起，人類歷史上結束了一個劃期，展開了一頁新頁。</p>
<p>在妄自大的日本軍閥，在去年今日是屈膝了。代表了日本軍閥現在拘禁在巢鴨監獄裏，而被列爲戰犯的，前日本軍大本營參謀總長梅津美治郎，同了日本政府的代表重光葵，在這艘美國軍艦上，在盟國統帥麥克阿瑟元帥及各盟國代表團的環視下，靜默無言地在降書上簽了他們的名字，重又悄悄地離去。這一簽字，不僅代表了正義必然戰勝强暴的信念，打破了日本人民自以爲有史以來日軍從不曾爲外族所征服日本本土從不曾被外族所侵占的迷信。這一簽字，並且代表了一個帝國的沒落，在人類史上展開了一個新的時代。在中國人民的心裏，米蘇里艦上的一幕，意義允爲　長。這是近五十年來日本侵華的總淸算，湔　了自一八九五年以來我們歷次所遭逢到恥辱。從那時起，日本就受盟國的管制，到如今也轉瞬一年了。今天我們重逢這個可紀念的日子，看看這一年來世界局勢的演變，誠不免感觸多端，謹申數言，以相惕勉。</p>
<p>我們首先不得不向身負盟國管制日本實際責任的麥克阿瑟元師，表示我們的敬意與贊佩。這位菲列賓解放者的五星元帥，不但是一位卓越的軍事領袖，且又是一位深通日本情形的大政治家。以之負管制日本的實際責任，實在是最適常的人物。在過去一年間，在麥克阿瑟元帥的管制下，我們看見有使日本趨於民主化的種種跡象。普選的舉行，財閥的解體，封建農佃關係的改進，以及憲法及其它法律的修改，都是使日本趨向於民主化的表徵。雖然它們的行進或不曾達到理想的速度，它們的範圍或也不全如我們的理想，但日本的確在變，從軍閥統治及封建制度的暴政下，變向到民主化。凡此變革，原非短時內所能立就；以日本人民中毒之深，此種變革允須一個較長的時間始能完成。麥克阿瑟元帥的穩健而同時又是非常積極的政策，在使日本人民能够有充分再教育的　會，使日本的民主化能够有穩固的基礎，實在是極合時宜的。</p>
<p>從日本看世界，過去一年間的動盪不安，令人不無惴惴。在這個動盪的世界裏，意識的衝突實在是一切動盪的主因。在軸心被　潰了的今日，若干國家仍權力政治是尙，以爲世界的和平只有在整個世界歸奉同一意識始能維繫，是其出發點，與日本軍閥的「八紘一宇」，究有多大差異？在日本簽降一周年紀念的前夕，麥克阿瑟元帥所發表的文告，特別指出這一點，其意義自至深長。麥帥首先就說：「溯自日本在米蘇里戰艦上簽訂降書以來，轉瞬已屆周年，現因有害思想之侵蝕，致使全世界爲疑懼不安之陰影所籠罩」；繼謂：「如任令此種思想蔓延）而無限制，則個性自由將爲之　然無存，久受極右派薰炙之人往往易成極左派思想之俘虜」；而最後却提醒我們，日本今後在世界所處的地位，其將成爲和平之堡壘呢，抑將變爲戰爭之跳版？這一警吿，實在値得我們深思，日本人民久在極右派思想黨炙之下，從極右到極左是易如反黨的。麥克阿瑟元帥管制日本政策的是否成功，我們放遠眼光來看，就要看它的能吾防制這種他自己所見到的變動。</p>
<p>於此，我們却又要提醒一點，就是日本主要的侵略人物，雖多名列戰犯，即將受到他們應得之刑；但日本軍閥的遺毒仍舊可散布並流傳在日本民間。軍閥首領的處死，未必即是日本軍部的死亡。格於波茨坦聲明，日本軍部雖在形式上業已瓦解，而爲日本軍部骨幹的靑年軍官仍復存在日本民間。這班人所受到的訓練及他們的意識，與普魯士軍官沒有分別。在凡爾塞和約下，失敗了的普魯士軍官，能得德國軍隊重新建立起來，散佈在日本民間的日本靑年軍官，又何嘗不在夢想等待着他們的機會？普魯士的戰爭觀念沉浸在日本靑年軍官的心靈深處，在他們或還以爲世界二次大戰的結束，不過是一塲戰役的結束，而不是戰爭的結束。</p>
<p>這是在這種軍閥餘毒及如麥帥所云的其它有害思想的交互侵蝕下，將成爲日本民主化的成脅·我們確信在師的英明政策下，這些威脅不能阻碍日本的眞正民主化。只有在日本澈底民主化的情形下，日本人民自身及世界和平纔能蒙受其利。</p>
<p>哀人為的失業羣！</p>
<p>時代的巨論，不斷地在推動着。我們的環境，亦無時無刻不緊隨着這個巨論而發生種種變化。能順應這種變化，而推陳出新，適應新環境的，這就叫做適者生存，否則便是時代落伍，難免遭受自然的淘汰。這是一種很明顯，很通常的事理。</p>
<p>但是「旁觀者淸，當局者迷，」處在局中的人，狃於向來的習慣，憚於革新的麻煩，往往蹈常襲故，好與時代　流相牴牾，因此發生了許多失　和怨恨的悲劇。我們對於這些時代的犧牲者，未嘗不寄以深切的同情。但是他們的惰性到底太深了，目光到底太短了，一味地怨天尤人，始終不肯改變，於是　竟免不了最後一幕的悲劇。</p>
<p>勝利以來，還衹短短的一年。但是沿街的　販，按　院的從業者，載魚的三輪車業，舞女的大班，差不多，已經隨着這潮流而俱去，擦背扦脚，人力車夫，至今尙在竭力掙扎之中。還有許多中間商人，上海所謂「掮客」，過去雖曾煊赫一時，無奈現在時値非常，以採取直接配售，或推行合作的結果，也不得不做了時代的犧牲者。這些，都是社會經濟變化的結果，無可避免，也並非那方面有意促成。只有準時度勢，相機改良</p>
<p>不過話又得說回來。這些犧牲者，如果確由於社會經濟變化的結果，我們誠覺愛莫能助。但假使由於政令革新，事出人爲，那麼，在決策推行以前，也很値得愼重考慮。就是：就本身論，此事是否必須推行？假如認爲必須推行，此時此地，有無立即推行的必要，與妥善適宜的安排？不好，我幹我的，人民的死活一　不管！</p>
<p>常前的經濟問題和失業問題，實在太嚴重了！假如並非眞正必要，似乎此時還犯不着再增加人民失業的嚴重性。此時此地，以怎樣能使人民休養生息，能安一時爲最上上策。去年，警察局曾擬取締擦背扦脚，後又下令展緩，這確是一個無成見而很賢明的舉措，就因時制宜而論，尤其値得我們贊許。現在時常聽到一種似是而非的論調，就是一面加强破壞現狀，增添失業，一面又很乾脆地說，那可由某某機關負責救濟，好像這兩方面可以各幹各的。其實，旣要破壞，何須救濟？旣感無力救濟，又何必一時多所破壞？而且，政府　現在究有那些機關，時時在準備着，専門替人家救濟那些人為的失業　。我們　覺得：為政之道，這時與地的因素，總須首先考慮到這是政治家唯一的課題！</p>

<p>〔本報綜合消息〕英美蘇密切注意下，決定希臘應為民主共和國抑君立憲國之公民投票，已於一日舉行，投票者逾一百五十萬人。投票進行時，左派及右派羣眾雖曾於各處發生衝突，互有死傷，但大體情形尙屬良好。據合眾社電，昨（二）日，各區投票之結果已陸續揭曉，目前雖尙有正式統計，但就一般估計，百分之七十至八十左右之選票皆贊成君主立憲，國王喬治二世之復位，似已不成問題，惟何時返國則尙未確定。政府二日宣佈檢清者計共一·二〇七·〇〇〇·票，其中贊成君主者達九二四·五四〇票。但三主反對派二日晨開會，議決發表聲明，否認此次投票之結果，認為其中有弊，故彼等「仍將繼續為民主共和國之建立而奮鬥」。</p>
<p>斯拉夫集團　弄巧反成拙</p>
<p>關於此次公民投票，保王派所以獲得壓倒之優勢，巴黎「抵抗」報一日曾為文加以分析，頗中　要。該文中稱，希臘左派在數月前，對於公民投票，原可操勝券，但因最近國際局勢之演變，已使希臘有復辟之可能。蓋國五喬治雖曾被指責，謂其具有「傾向法西斯之態度」，但在蘇聯指使下，南斯拉夫保加利亞兩國代表在巴黎和會；曁烏克蘭代表在紐約聯合國安全理事會中之分別向希臘發動攻勢，反而引起希臘人民之團結精神，藉以應付斯拉夫民族包圍之威脅。</p>

<h3>美軍人協會席上　顧維鈞演說</h3>
<p>〔聯合社美國西弗吉尼亞，惠林二日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞今日在美國軍人協會全國大會致詞稱：目前世界情形已與往日不同，新問題因而產生，此項問題亦必須以新的，不同的方法解決之。戰後世界為一新世界，和平工作僅在巴黎開始，就其目前進展情形而論，則和約何時可以簽訂，世界何時可以專心致力於復興工作，無從預言。</p>

<h3>印臨時政府閣員　昨宣誓就職　回教徒懸黑旗表抗議　孟買市續發生大暴動</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕印度臨時政府主要閣員七人，於昨（二日）晨正式宣誓就職。據路透社訊，閣員分配如下：</p>
<p>外交兼聯邦事務　尼赫魯（國大黨主席）</p>
<p>國防　辛格（國大黨主席）</p>
<p>內政（包括情報及廣播）　巴台爾（國大黨）</p>
<p>財政　馬特哈（印度基督教派）</p>
<p>交通（運輸及鐵道）　阿柴爾艾里（回教徒）</p>
<p>農糧　普拉薩特（國大黨）</p>
<p>勞工　賴姆（賤民同盟主席）</p>
<p>衛生·教育·藝術　阿瑪特甘（回教徒）</p>
<p>立法·郵政及航空　薩希爾（回教徒）</p>
<p>工業及供應　拉加戈巴拉却里（國大黨）</p>
<p>工礦電力　鮑斯（國大黨）</p>
<p>商務　巴勃哈（派西族領袖）</p>
<p>就職典禮係於二日上午十一時在新德里總督府廣場舉行，典禮進行時，回教徒曾爬上總督府對面高達一百二十呎之門頂上昇起黑旗，以示輕侮及抗議之意，但旋即為警察發現扯下。典禮後，尼赫魯出臨陽台，受台下成千成萬羣眾之熱烈歡呼。但由於回教聯盟之未曾參加臨時政府，且堅決表示不願合作，故新政府成立之日，亦即全國各地騷亂迭起之時。據路透社電，孟買一日即發生暴動，死傷近三百人。孟買政府已宣布緊急狀態。動亂之起，係因回教聯盟囑令回教徒懸掛黑旗，以示對印度臨時政府之輕侮，因此引起示威衝突。</p>
<p>據聯合社電，孟買暴動擴大至新區域，二日午後印回教徒衝突結果，至少有六十人殞命，軍警開入騷擾區域時，被羣眾投擲石塊，警察乃開槍自衛。城內已實施戒嚴，至少有五百人被捕，受傷者約二百人，其中二十人傷勢沉重。</p>
<p>鬩牆之爭　危害國族</p>
<p>新政府領袖尼赫魯，對於此種鬩牆之爭，極表惋惜，謂：「吾人尙在向吾人之目標前進，而前途仍極艱險」。彼對「回盟採取另一途徑」一事表示遺憾，並謂：「吾人仍繼續希望彼等之合作，合作之門將永久開放」。另據合眾社悉，尼赫魯可能將率領印度代表團前往巴黎和會，作短時間之勾留。</p>
<p>據回教聯盟領袖之一艾利甘一日在霍爾省民眾大會上稱，「回盟之直接行動，意在使尼赫魯政府無從行使其職權，吾人當發動拒付租金運動，並在政治上及社會上抵制印度教徒及英國人。吾人並當實行焚毀餘糧政策，使回教區內之餘糧不致為印度教徒所得」。</p>
<p>王淑陶氏發表談話</p>
<p>本市訊：新近由渝來滬之中國中印學會總幹事王淑陶氏，昨吿中央社記者稱：中印兩國發生關係已千餘年，毗隣相處，並末發生戰爭，亦不因喜馬拉雅山之阻隔，而使文化之交流有所障礙，現印度獲得初步獨立，吾人至表歡愉，今後中印兩國携手合作，實為世界和平之安定力量。關於印度內部糾紛問題，王氏認為印度必能自己解決，因印度民族之忍耐力至強，將來或採取類似聯邦制度，而成立一偉大統一之國家，又聞該會監理事長戴季陶·朱家驊將去電致賀。</p>
<h3>蔣夫人電賀</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里二日電〕尼赫魯所獲之賀電中，有來自蔣夫人宋美齡女士者，內稱：吾等謹祝閣下成功，吾等對印度局勢，深為注意，對閣下已往之成就，謹致賀意。</p>

<h3>日內省昨發表復興計劃</h3>
<p>大部人民將從事農業</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕內務省今日發表詳密之五年復興計劃，將使五年後日本人民百分之六十，皆從事於農業工作。該劃計乃以日本人口至一九五〇年可達八千萬人為根據，目的在改變日人生活，成一農業國家；工業方面，則僅以和約中所允許者為限。據內務省預測：日本在糧食方面，約有百分之八十五可以自給，每年自海外輸入糧食八千五百萬萬斗，可由出口貿易抵價。此計劃如獲實施，則日本失業問題可吿解決。各主要城市之人口，將使其保持現在狀態，不許再有新戶口移入。復興工作將着重於較小城市及鄉區。因復興計劃而獲得工作之日人，為數將有三千八百萬，其中二千萬人將從事農業及漁業，其餘則從事於工礦兩業。工業方面，將雇用工作六百三十萬，比戰時最高峯減少三百萬。工廠與學校將重行分配，以適應此項變遷。</p>

<h3>蘇聯野心勃勃堪憂慮　太平洋美軍不足自衛　美眾院軍事委員發出警吿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山一日電〕眾院軍委會委員六人在東京考察，發出警吿謂：「第二次珍珠港事變，一觸即發。」若輩對蘇聯野心表示憂慮，並承認美國在太平洋駐軍不足自衛。權觀北太平洋地圖，美國外圍防綫，以阿拉斯加·阿留申羣島·日本及朝鮮南部為基地，在華北亦有少數駐軍。此外國防綫之後，有關島·薩班·琉球·菲律賓及其他基地。蘇聯在阿留申之西，則有司令島濱海省·千島列島·庫頁島·西伯利亞·朝鮮北部，及旅順大連。雙方地勢已成遙遙相對之局。以兵力論，美國太平洋艦隊實力雄厚，遠非蘇聯幾艘潛艇所可望其項背。濱海省康沙莫斯基港，雖有建造較大軍艦設備，但亦追趕不及。惟蘇聯在西伯利亞之陸軍，則在數量上遠過西太平洋美國全部兵力，蘇聯前在中國東北所捕去之七十五萬日軍，現仍下落不明，其將為蘇聯作戰乎？此仍一疑實也。其尤為重大之問題，則為空軍。蘇聯雖曾於戰前首先練成降落傘部隊，但第二次世界大戰中，已發明遠程轟炸機及空運部隊，則傘兵尙有何用，頗難確定。蘇聯空軍實力，除自造戰鬥機及在美租借法項下所取得之飛機外，餘不可知。美國空軍力已有驚人之發展，則為有目共覩之事實。B—29型超空堡壘，自B—36型同溫層轟炸機發明後，已成明日黃花。無人駕駛飛機亦已試驗成功。美國與加拿大在北冰洋之聯防演習，正在大規模進行，雙方並皆從事於V—2型火箭試驗。最後，美國已造成原子彈，蘇聯則尚在研究之中。</p>
<h3>佔領日本第一週年　麥帥昨發表文吿　東京在平靜中渡過未行儀式　尼米資同時提警吿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕麥帥今日發表佔領日本第一週年文吿，提及民主與共產在日本鬥爭之危機。略謂：戰後再教育之日本，將形成何種槪念乎？此一問題之答案，對於人類之命運與文明之前途，具有深切之影響。觀念在日本之衝突，對於依照波茨坦宣言意向覓求民主途徑者，並無不利。日人久處於極保守之右派理論訓練之下，或易於急進派之理論所惑。民主思想係人權，正義，與清白之結晶，將為日本自由之基石，除非為藐視個人尊嚴之敵對思想之侵入，而被滅絕與壓制。日人之信仰已因戰敗而幻滅。其所相信所生存之一切事物，均已宣吿解體。美國士兵携带優秀之自尊，自信，與自制而俱來，暗示日人以其從前信仰之慮偽，因此而發生一種精神革命，此乃世界社會史上無比的大變動。此種精神改革，若加鼓勵，並予以發展之機會，則其基礎較之虛偽信仰所寄託者，將更為深入與持久。但極端思想每因不正確之宣傳，與動聽之標語，而獲得真正自由派之信仰與支持。過去一年間，成就頗多，但尚待完成者亦復不少，其間證明民主力量促進持久之和平，已有顯著之收穫。此種收穫，務須鞏固而擴大之。其途徑則需要忍耐與決心，俾依據最善之社會觀念及政治標準，形成日人之生活與制度，目標甚為偉大，因日本各島所處軍略地位，若不成為和平之有力的屏藩，即將成為戰爭的跳板也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕日本正式投降第一週年紀念日，美國徴兵機構適於此時又開始活動，以謀保持軍隊規定之實力。徵召今將分發各兵站，以便召集十九歲至廿九歲之壯丁二萬五千名，此輩經兩個月之「徵召假期」後，將於九月內入伍。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京二日合眾電〕今日為日本投降週年紀念，然此間並無特別紀念儀式，盟國機關大都停止工作但此係因勞工節適與米蘇里戰艦上簽訂降書後週年紀念互相巧合之故。美國人及日本人均未舉行特別節目，麥帥工作如恒整日忙於舉行會議，及其他例行工作。日本報紙均未有述及紀念日之社論，僅英文之日本時報，提醒日人謂：彼等對世界各國負有法律及道德義務，以履行波茨坦條款。</p>
<p>（尼米資元帥）</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二日廣播，尼米茲海軍上將於日本投降一周紀念日，提出警吿稱：美國必須以武力作後盾，藉以實現公正之和平。「余認為貝爾納斯在和會中發表見解，必須具有權威，此點須由堅強之海軍在後支持。」</p>
<h3>莫斯科今舉行龐大紀念式</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦一日電〕莫斯科廣播，本日宣布蘇聯紀念九月三日對日勝利一周年之龐大計劃。蘇京各廣場及街道已加裝飾，屆時將有規模巨大之遊行及娛樂節目。</p>
<h3>巴西物價高漲　國會緊急會議</h3>
<p>議員起爭執演成武劇</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴西京城一日電〕昨日此間民眾因反抗高物價發生暴動，此一古來歡樂之城，今日已實施戒嚴。現有軍隊巡邏全城，以防再度發生衝突。昨衝突結果，一人殞命，百人受傷，及五百人被補。當局宣布：全市商店將於明日在軍警保護下開市。各方面現正採取緊急措置，以應付經濟危機。物價已高漲三倍，黑市猖獗。同時國會亦召開緊急會議，調查物價暴漲原因，由熱烈爭辯而演出武劇。前總統即現任參議員伐爾加斯，對目前危機應由前政府負責一點，力加駁斥，並要求責難者在議場外相見。當某議員指責伐爾加斯政府負搗亂之責任時，天主教神甫議員卡馬拉一拳擊中另一議員之鼻。一部份人士稱：巴西物價自一九四四年以來，增加百分之三百，引起薪水階段，學生及工人之示威運動，致演成暴動。</p>

<h3>一服清涼劑　穩渡中秋節　貝祖詒表示有把握　解除工業界難關　潘徐兩議長呼籲結果圓滿　決辦理小型工業貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會長潘公展，副議長答寄廣，連日曾與一部分工商界參議員交換意見，僉以當前各工廠困難重重，面臨危機，銀極奇緊，前各廠已獲允準之工業貸款，亦臨時中止，似此情形，前途誠不堪想像，參議會於本月九日方能開幕，中秋節轉瞬即至，倘不於事前急謀解救，則將噬　無及。爰由與會者一致議決，公推潘徐兩氏代表，往晤行政院院長宋子文，中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，陳述工業界之痛苦，並請求救濟。</p>
<p>昨日下午潘徐兩氏當晤及貝氏，貝氏表示：本人對工業界素所關切，一月前即已計劃小型工業貸款辦法，當時曾由民營金融界參加商討，該項計劃，曾報告宋院長，惟以外匯調整關係，不得不暫時採取緊縮，上月卅一日，本人復將該項辦法簽呈宋院長，當蒙批準，乃交本行業務局辦理矣。該項貸款辦法，係由每十家錢荘組成一組，彼此連環担任，凡有關工業生產事宜，可向中央銀行申請，請求再貼現，其貸款數額每組為一億五千萬元。</p>
<p>潘徐兩氏聞及該項辦法後，當時即表示：（一）貸款對象為小型工業，恐範圍過狹；（二）十家錢荘僅獲得貸款一億五千萬元，每家值一千五百萬元，倘用之於工業生產，其數未免戔微，希能放寬數額；（三）銀行亦多作工業放款者，希能遍及各銀行。</p>
<p>貝氏答謂：（一）上海工廠大都屬小規模工業，除紗廠有盈利無需貸款外，其他各工廠均可謂小型工業；（二）放寬貸款數額，當予以考慮；（三）計劃該辦法時，以工廠大都與錢荘有往來，故有此規定，現決定各銀行亦照上項辦法辦理。</p>
<p>最後潘徐兩氏復謂：本市金融，須力求安定，俾可逐漸恢復元氣，工業界困難諸多，中秋節在邇，希能安然渡過。尤望體念最近蔣主席之指示：「生產貸款不在緊縮之例，」對工業界勿一律緊縮。貝氏答稱：工業界情況，決隨時注意，本人有把握本屆中秋節金融方面決不致發生任何意外，今明日內當將上項情形轉呈宋院長云。</p>
<h3>今日慶祝勝利週年　三萬件慰勞品分發</h3>

<h3>為正義自由而死　新聞界同人　歇浦弔忠魂</h3>
<p>在抗戰期中，上海北美事業從業員殉難者之眾多，幾超過全國各地總數，其死事之慘烈，及其可歌可泣之事蹟，為全國人士所欽敬，上海市新聞界同人為特於昨日上午十時假市商會大禮堂舉行上海市新聞界抗戰殉難烈士追悼大會，以追悼為正義自由而死難之朱惺公等十五烈士，共到百餘人，由記者公會常務監事潘公展、程中行、主祭、馮有真等陪祭，禮堂中央縣朱惺公、金華亭、張似旭、程振章、邵虛白、李駿英、馮夢雲、趙國棟、陳桐軒、周維善、秦鐘煥、吳鴻煃、朱鳴春、王安陸、陳坤林諸烈士之遺像及神位，臺前為中宣部部長彭學沛，中央社社長蕭同茲，及外勤記者聯誼會等所贈之花圈，臺四週滿懸輓聯輓幛，上海市新聞記者公會輓云：「摘奸鋤敵，宇動風雷，勁草嚴霜，常留浩氣。取義成仁，光騰淞滬，丹心碧血，永蔫馨香。」申報輓云：「風高月黑，魔索盤旋，可憐倔強書生，十步芳茵濺碧血，雨過天青，爐煙縹緲，應念情親氣類，一尊旨酒酹英靈。」此外新聞報，中央社，中央日報，大公報，民國日報，文匯報，大晚報等各報社亦均有輓贈。</p>
<p>追悼儀式開始</p>
<p>十一時荘嚴隆重之追悼儀式，於哀樂中開通，主祭程中行獻花獻香，及全體向烈士行禮，靜默誌哀後，宣讀大會祭文，文曰：「維中華民國三十五年九月二日，上海市新聞記公會曁新聞界全部同人謹以清酌香花之　，致祭於新聞界抗戰殉難烈士之靈曰：芸芸禹甸，肇基崑崙，歷史綿邈，親遠睦鄰，殺機飚發，　啓東瀛，封豕長蛇，肆其侵陵，光炎熾浩，肇敱震驚，蘆清月冷，滬瀆雲沉，抗戰軍起，舉國同心，新聞鬥士，執筆前列，顯隱發覆，嚴於斧鉞，不畏強梁，乃遭毒　，為國捐軀，青燐碧血，偉哉先烈，忠朗日星，懋績昭　，炳炳麟麟，勝利旣逢，勒碑刻銘，竹帛留芳，千古永欽，魂兮歸來，享此清樽，鳴呼哀哉，尚饗。」</p>
<p>程中行報告</p>
<p>繼由主席程中行報告，略謂：上海為全國教育文化新聞之中心，五十年來自辛亥革命至抗戰勝利，國內一切大事均發動於上海，上海之輿論領導全國，而此次抗戰之鼓舞提倡，在大後方新聞界同人亦遭致極大困難，如民二十八重慶之「五三」「五四」之大轟炸，但無論敵人如何瘋狂轟炸，在後方之報紙未有一日停刋，以迄勝利為止，反視敵人於去年七月盟國空軍轟炸大坂長崎後，竟三日無報，我人聆此消息後，足以自傲，益信抗戰勝利即可實現，蓋在新聞界所表現之精神，已可看出矣，然在淪陷區尤其在上海之同業，與敵偽奮鬥之精神，則更非後方同業所能望其項背，民三十張季鸞先生在接受米蘇里獎狀時，亦曾特別提出上海新聞界之偉大精神，蓋以後方有數百萬大軍保衛我們編輯，保衛我們言論，雖有空襲，但有警報使我人能從容躲入防空洞，以免死亡，陷區同業則不然彼等旣無大軍保衛，且終日在緊急警報聲中以求正義和平，今勝利已臨，是為全世界之輿論奮鬥成功在聯合國憲章，基本自由中最重要者為言論自由，抗戰八年來諸先烈為基本自由人類正義和平而犧牲，全國同業今後應繼承諸先烈之精神為新聞自由，人類基本自由而奮鬥。</p>
<p>潘議長致詞</p>
<p>潘公展繼以市參議會議長身份致詞，謂新聞界諸先烈為基本自由奮鬥而犧牲，今後要建立基本自由，必須以新聞界之力量——報紙——及民意機關——各級議會——以真正代表民意之機構能力合作，重視每一人應有之自由，不惜任何犧牲，以保障人類自由，則方始能走入民主政治之大道，上海新聞界有數十年歷史，有形無形對國家多，諸先烈不顧犧牲為國民家族發揚正義，爭取整個民族之自由，在建立民主大道時，其供獻更大，西人有名言：「不自由毋寗死」，諸先烈即為此種精神為自由而死，以後希望新聞界與市參議會合作，以一切精神求取保障自由精神，並以奠定民主政治之基礎。</p>
<p>遺屬要求三點</p>

<h3>「太平花」　畢竟中華列四強　知音草木亦成章</h3>

<h3>生活指數如此算法　根據五十四種日常用品求出平均數　調查大眾消費最多的物品作為對象</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前與任何人都有深切關係的，莫過於市政府每月發表的生活費指數，究竟這一種指數是根據怎麼樣的材料？用怎麼樣的方法計算出來的呢？</p>
<p>為求明瞭起見，這裏先介紹一個計算生活費指數的基本公式：</p>
<p>看起來拫簡單，所要曉得的祗是物品的價格和平均的消費量而已，但是要搜集各種確切的資料，可不是一朝一夕的功夫。上海從民國十五年起就開始了生活指數的編纂，現在計算時是以民國二十五年為基期。</p>
<p>物品價格的調查以最為常用或消費最多的為對象，分成食物衣着佳屋雜品四類，最近總數共有五十四種。方法是在選定的若干區域內，以擁有多數消費者的商店或市塲為資料供給者，由市府研究室每星期三派員前往調查一次各種物品的市價，這些調查員全有多年的工作經騐，與所調查的對象都已非常熟悉，因此其所得結果大體上相當準確，並且每一種物品的價格，至少要綜合十家以上不同的開價平均以後才確定為某項物品在某一個星期內的市價，然後再以四星期或五星期的市價平均所得始為某一月內某項物品的價格。</p>
<p>至於平均的消費量因為變動極微，所以目前計算時工人指數尚係根據三十一年調查三〇五家工人家庭所得結果，職員指數則係根據三十年調查四一八家職員家庭所得結果。其方法是由此數百家選定之家庭，各將其每日各種費用之支出詳數記載於特別設計之帳簿中，然後由調查機關根據此項記帳分門別類，綜合分析，求得平均每一家庭對於某種物品一年間的消費總數，再用十二個月來分攤，才得到每個月的平均消費量。</p>
<p>以這樣得來的數字按照上面的公式再來一下綜合的平均，就得出每月為社會各階層所據以計算薪津工資的生活指數了。</p>
<p>有不少人對於生活指數的計算法不明瞭，認為與實際的物價不符。舉一個最近的例來說：這次外匯放長以後，物價大跳是事實，但發表的八月份工人生活指數祗較七月份增了百分之〇·九五，因此對於它的正確性頗為懷疑。但據負責編製者說：這實在是一種誤會，因為生活費指數是用平均值來計算，這次匯率變動是在八月下旬的事，以全月平均起來，其影響當然甚微。再則調查物品價格是以大眾消費最多的為對象，例如來，最近價格就很少上落，而有許多遽漲的物品則不在五十四種以內，這也是生活費指數上升甚微的重要原因。</p>
<h3>赴美考察水利工程　馮玉祥夫婦離滬　何應欽夫人同輪出國</h3>

<h3>敎育問題嚴重性日增　朱敎長向主席請示　杭敎次留京朱敎次隨同赴牯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕時局動蕩不定，敎育問題嚴重性，亦日見增加。朱部長家驊，杭次長經農，均赴牯嶺，向　主席有所表示。僅杭次長立武留京，綜理部務。記者一日乃就敎育經費，復員，學生學，敎授待遇，諸問題趨詢，承告如下：（一）敎育經費困難，為目前遭遇之最大難題。收復區各級敎育復員發展，在在需款，敎部已擬具預算，請將復員費增加，此案已呈請政院核示，短期內當可決定。（二）各校復員，受交通不暢影響，均未達預期情況。各地中小學，供求不適就在，失學問題亦因之而起。敎部對此深感困難，但如經費方面無問題，公立學校數目及容量增加，當可漸謀解決（三）後方重慶大學等第六校復員還鄕學生就問題，敎部已指定中大等校定期舉行轉學生考試。並儘量使彼等獲得輕學之便利與機會，尤一考試失敗，仍可返回原校就讀，不致失學，至返回原校之旅費，則係小問題。（四）大學敎授復員後，居住環境，率多亞劣，研究設備，更屬缺乏。京滬一帶，生活不易，壯況至窘。敎部對此至為焦慮，最近雖已將敎授研究費增為五尤元，實際仍無補於事，敎部惟有隨時設法補救。</p>

<p>（一）各學校應將所收學費存入銀行（由學校自定），所有利息，應列人學校經濟費項下。（二）各學校在開學後，及學期終了前，分兩次將收入數額報吿各該校稽核委員會，同時由學校公佈，並呈報敎育局備查。（三）各學校免費學額，感照比例辦理，（各中學免費學額百分之十五，各小學免費學額百分之二十）。（曾）學生膳費，應分期徵收，並組織膳食委員會辦理，家長願一次繳納者聽。（五）各學校所收各項費用，應照規定名目使用。以上各項決定後，即由新本女小校長沈嗚，為校金被軍人金漢鼎武力佔領事，提出申訴。衛生局張局長，為學校辦理健康敎育率，亦發表意見，略謂；市府將恢復健康敎育委員會，由市長任主任委員，敎育局長任副主任委員，希各校對「敎」與「育」並重，各校所收衛生費，須取諸學校．用諸學校云。會議至五時半始散。</p>

<p>〔本報天津訊〕集天津籃球好手組織之華勝遠征上海籃球除，自上月中旬籌備以來，業吿就緒，日前北平之北星隊，特來津與泰東隊作遠征軍代表選拔比賽。北星隊擁有昔日上海名手趨雅林李賓中等，泰東隊為本市勁旅，麾下有王有才，王鴻斌，尹煥文等，實力甚强，是日門票售每券二千元，觀衆慕名而來者，約計二千餘人，創勝利後續球塲空前紀錄，全部門票收入，悉充華勝隊征滬旅費。比賽結果，上半時北星隊棋差一着，以八比十七落後，易地後，北星雖力圖振作，奈泰東衆將着着進逼，結果泰東隊以四十三比二十人輕取北星。至於華勝隊何日啓程征滬，則尙待上海籃球委負會之覆電，且北星須先行返平，一俟遴選完畢，即整裝啟程。</p>

<h3>改進上海中等敎育芻議（中）</h3>
<p>— 謝恩皋</p>
<p>改進上海中等敎育，從客觀事實來言，似以加緊物質建設　最首要。設施敎育不能沒有工具，物質設備便是設施敎育的重要工具之一方面。工欲善其事，必先利其器，貧乏的物質環境，決不會產生高皮的敎育效能。沒有完善理科實騐設備，談不到科學敎育的設施；沒有適用農工實習塲所，談不到勞動敎育的推行；沒有健身房體育塲游泳池的建築，談不到健强體格的鍛鍊；沒有規模完備的圖書館，談不到良好學習態度的培養。其他一切一切的設備，在在均與實施敎育效能有關。良好有效的鈪有成果，絕無可以倖致之理。上海中等學校數量雖甚發達，而其物質設備委實極度可憐。其中除少數略有基礎者外，大多數均是租用民房做課室，採光通氣皆談不到，其他更屬有名無實。這種中等敎寶，除掉訓練文字工具的應用能力與傳授抽象的書本知識以外，別無收獲可言。敎育要使發生偉大力量，必須滲透學生整個的生活。學生視學校為傳舍，上課則來，退課則去；因為受了物質設備不足的限制，師生周學間共同生活機會幾等於零，相互精神感應無由見功，一任靑年於社會駭浪中自行徵逐，隨俗浮沉，這未免太危險太有失設施敎育的本意。敎育原非僅靠物質設備可以盡其功能，然無物質設備，即使有了敎育能手，亦無用武之地。尤其在靑年階段中等敎育時代，必須賴有豐富的物質環境，完成其美滿而合理的敎育生活，才能使學生身心得到平衡的發展。否則皆是殘缺而不完整的一種中等敎育。這種殘缺而不完整的中等敎育，對於國家社會的影響，是害多而利少。</p>
<p>基於前說，改進上海中等敎育，可以歸納為左列三個原則：</p>
<p>（一）學校數量旣已有了相當的發展，今後即應注意學校素質的提高。</p>
<p>（二）私立中等學校數量旣多於公立中等學校，提高學校素質期其有效，必須對於私立中等學校要確定一個有效而普遍的改進辦法</p>
<p>（三）提高學校素質旣以改善物質建設為先決條件。今後對於大多數物質貧乏之私立中等學校即應通盤籌劃，協力其物質環境於相當時期內能有澈底更新之改造。</p>
<p>上述改進上海中等敎育的途徑，如何可以走通而達成其目的，此即為本文所欲提出之建議。</p>
<p>上學期本市公私立中等學校學生總數不到八萬人，本學期後方學生紛紛復員來滬，中學學生可能增至十萬人，三五年後，更可能增至二十萬人至三十萬人。設使以二十萬中學學生為設計目標。每一中等學校假定容納一千人至一千五百人，只要一百四十所至二百所中等學校便可全部容納。即使中學學生擴充至三十萬人，如果每一中等學校容量亦皆隨同擴充至一千五百人，二百所中等學校不需增加，仍可全部容訥。現時中學學生不足八萬人，而公私立中等學校數竟達二百二十六所之多，每一中等學校平均學生數不到四百人，以言效能，不免顯得低落。改進方針，人力物大過差，發展無望之少數私立中等學校首應勸其歸併，停辦。或改辦小學，保留辦理歷史悠久成效較著校黃會組織已臻健全師資人選符合標準渚百數十校，除如私立中西女中徐匯中學等十餘校物質建設已具相當規模不須重行建造老外，其他條校，可集合政府與社會兩方面力量另謀新的建設。這種新的建設，必須經濟適用而最合於實施靑年敎育的理想。如何實現這一計劃，依我意思，於上海東西南北四郊利用原有公地或徵用民地闢為四大中等敎育區，每區以一千五百畝至二千畝為度，以建築三十所至四十所中等學校為範圍，以收容三萬至六萬中學學生為標的。比如西區虹橋飛機塲，原為上海市高中以上學生集中軍訓營地，後以中日形勢緊張，奉中央命令擴大徵收隣近民地而為飛機塲，約在千畝以上，後因龍華江灣兩飛機塲開闢，虹橋飛機塲即被棄置不用。今則荒草蔓延，成為附近農民畜牧塲所。如由地方政府呈准中央撥作建設中等敎育區，化無用為有用，豈僅上海一地之幸！</p>

<p>廿二區組調解會</p>
<p>第二十二區公所（江灣）前（卅一日）舉行第七次區務會議，首由徐副區長報吿，略調前倪副區長業巳辭職照准，遺缺由本人接充。繼對工作方面有所闡說，各股主任亦報告一月內經辦工作，並即席討論議案，計重要者（一）本區人事調整，速請市政府批准；（二）即日組織調解委員會：（三）查報敵偽產業及共公造產事？（四）籌辦本區同仁福利事宜等數件云。又該區第五保長徐中天，第九保保長金錦弟辭職，該區公所已另選李尙達為第五保長，金守良為第九保長。</p>

<h3>民政處解釋　遷徙登記疑義</h3>
<p>市府民政處據第五區公所簽呈，轉據六十二保保長韓守康等呈稱：關於查報戶口發生疑義數點：（一）三房客搬走一空，事前旣未退租，亦不來保呈報遷出，事後該市民等甚至將國民身份證一併帶走，此種戶口，二房東或同居之另一戶長，是否可代表報出，本保應如何查報？（二）三房客將物件搬空而並未退租，亦不聲明，是否回鄕，抑或再要來住居，更未到保報出，或呈報臨時流動戶口，將房門鎖起，竟數月至一年半載，均不返者，此種戶口，本保應如何查報處理？（三）與前項情形相同，惟房內尙留一二件廢物，此種戶口，曾見民政處在中央日報及申報答示長虹君有：「門上加銷，似有返回之意」一語。竊以「如有返回之意，該戶遷出時亦應來保陳報臨時流動戶口登記，方可憑查而符手續，旣不陳報而又將門鎖數月或一年，當此鎖閉下去，誠類似逃亡人口也」，保甲應如何查報辦理？又有刁地保甲長，常有憑藉地位，魚民怨沸騰。各級地方政府應切弊端，令仰轉飭知照云。</p>
<p>滑之三房客，藉此將房屋轉頂與第四者，從中攫取巨利，於是該房屋先經鎖閉，一旦第四者遷入，二房東若有詢問，第四者即憑藉與三房客有租賃權，置之不理，二房東若與三房客起訴，而三房客已不知何處去矣。（四）逃亡人口應如何查報，是否僅呈報某戶現己遷出，不知遷於何處。以上四點敬祈釋示，傳資遵循。</p>
<p>昨經　政處詳示如下：（一）三房客搬出一空，如未聲請遷出，事後該管　　　保長得代聲請。（一）遷出已滿月以上者，仍未聲請為遷出發記，該管甲長或保長得代聲請。（三）「門上加鎖，似有返回之意思」，為事實上之推理，然流動人口登記，或遷出登記，仍須依法聲請，因聲請遷出後，並非不得再行返回。至防止房屋租賃流弊，應請與主管機關妥商辦法。（四）逃亡人口仍由戶長聲請遷出，至逃亡戶可照第一點解釋</p>
<h3>各區簡訊</h3>
<p>本市第十二區（北寗）區民代表會，走今日上午八時假膠州路昌平路口市立民衆實騐學校禮堂，召開第一次大會。</p>
<h3>戶籍法規　疑義問答（續）</h3>
<p>（六十二）問：太籍或寄籍有變更時，依法應通知關係戶籍主任為本籍，或寄籍之註銷域轉籍之登記，惟戶籍登記聲請書上，關於該管及關係戶籍主任均無欄司登，受收之戶籍主任，無法通知，應如何辦理？</p>
<p>答：可由聲請義務人，將當時人之該管或有關之戶籍管轄區域，於聲請書備考欄內註明。</p>
<p>（六十三）問；私生子應從何姓？</p>
<p>答，私生子即民法上所稱之非婚生子女，其生父母無可考者，即戶籍上所稱之棄兒，在戶籍法即五十八條第二項，原設有戶籍主任，應即為之立姓命名之規定。如棄兒之己有人收養者，依民法第一零七八條規定，應從收養者之姓，其出生之登記聲請，儘可准用通常程序為之。又非婚生子女，其生母與人結婚後，依民法一零六五條第二項之規定，應從其母姓。</p>

<h3>上海銀錢業聯合準備會成立　銀根緊迫時即出面應付　代表行荘共一六〇單位</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籌備經年之上海銀錢業聯合準備會，終於昨日下午三時，假銀行俱樂部，舉行成立大會。出席該會執行委員李馥蓀，徐維明，李道南，徐寄廣，錢新之，秦潤卿，沈日新七人，及各會員行荘一百三十四人，代表行荘共一百六十單位。當公推李馥蓀担任大會主席。李氏即席報告該會籌備經過，略稱：本會係繼續前銀行業同業公會聯合準備會而設，現在因加入錢業，組織雖然擴大，會務實未中斷。創辦之始，正值一二八抗戰之後，抗戰之次日，全體罷市，形勢嚴重。聯合準備會於數日內，籌設成立，集成四千餘萬之財產，無異同業間驟增二千餘萬之存銀，市面因以安定。以後每遇政局問題，釀成金融風潮，均賴準備會調劑其間，得以安穩過渡。</p>
<p>勝利以後籌備情形</p>
<p>勝利以後，會同錢業公會，籌設銀錢業聯合準備會，擬具公約草案，呈請財政部核示，本年六月終，始奉財政部核準。即於七月十日，召開銀行公會理監事會，并約請錢業公會理監事代表出席，舉行聯席會議。以會務亟待籌劃進行，所有第一屆執行委員，由兩公會推舉，決定銀行業五人，錢業二人。錢業二人，推定秦潤卿先生，沈日新先生。銀行業五人，即責成聯合準備會常務委員五人，繼續任事。當經聯席會議，一致通過，即着手籌備進行。一方面函各行荘，徵求加入簽訂本會公約。其中因公約內有連環保證一語，最為各行荘所注意。即經由兩公會呈請財政部解釋，現已奉到部令，如連環保證責任問題發生時，應視各會員行荘當時實領公庫證數目比例分担。即經訂入本會章程內，以資遵守。執行委員會在籌備期報告：（一）為決定會員行荘認繳財產數目，決定以一千萬元為最低額，以最近三個月存款平均數二成，為最高額。（二）為決定執行委員任期為三年。（三）為依照公約擬訂本會章程，加入部令解釋連環保證原文，以資遵守。至決定分攤經費標準，照公約依據認繳財產總額比例分担。但行荘認繳總額，相差甚鉅（自一千萬元至十八億元）。準備會為行荘服務，原屬無分軒輊，若專以認繳財產為比例，似欠公允，擬定一基本數目，假定每家五萬元，超過此數，再以比例分担辦法分攤，似較公平。</p>
<p>希望同業謹慎第一</p>
<p>現在本會辦理伊始，有幾句話應向大會報告。本會原以同業互助這宗旨，在此國事紛紜，金融未能穩定時候。國家銀行，又標榜緊縮方針。希望同業在此時期，以謹慎為第一，希冀穩渡難關。等到國是大定，再行放手做事。準備會只能作為解決銀緊時之一機構，如遇全市銀根緊迫時，準備會當出面應付，中央銀行允為後盾。至平時營運，仍請各行荘守定本位，量力應付，對準備會勿存奢望，使準備會基礎日益鞏固，為社會所重視，為政府所重視，然後遇有困難局境，方可出面應付，這是鄙人竭誠忠告的一件事，務請諒　。</p>
<p>通過章程三十二條</p>
<p>繼即討論章程，共通過三十二條。茲摘其犖犖大者：關於準備財產，第六條規定：會員行荘，應認定金額，備繳評價相當之準備財產。逢價值低落或有其他變動情形時，並應負隨時繳足之責任。認繳準備財產額，以各該行荘三個月內平均每月存款總數之二成為最高額，以國幣一千萬元為最低額。第七條規定準備財產，以下列種類為限：一·政府發行之債券，及其他交易所核定上市之有價證券。二·經財政部核準之投資憑證。三·依法登記並有市價而隨時可以變賣之本市房屋地產。四·貨物棧單立時可以變賣者。關於公庫證：第十一條規定會員行荘所繳準備財產，依評價金額七折開給公庫證。第十二條規定公庫證為記名式。第十三條規定會員行荘得以公庫證，為債務担保。其延不清償者，本會得依照公約第四章第十三條之規定處理之。（該條規定：會員行荘，以公庫證為債務担保。延不清償者，本會因債權行荘之請求，應將該行荘原繳準備財產之全部或一部，立即變賣。以變賣所得金額，代其清償債務。有餘交還原繳行荘，不足仍應就其本身之其他資產，依法追償。第十四條規定公庫證持有人，如遇公庫證遺失或毀滅等情事，應即通知本會，並登報聲明。如一個月內無糾葛發生，得向本會提供担保，或覓具相當保證，另行補給公庫證。</p>
<p>會費按照比例分擔</p>
<p>最後討論該會經費分攤辦法，計每月一千二百萬元，由各會員行荘，依所繳準備財產評價金額，比例分担之。其繳納辦法，由執行委員會議定之。大會延至五時半，始告散會。</p>
<p>又昨日各會員行荘代表人於開會前，紛紛簽名於公約，以表一致同意該公約規定，並連環保證，呈由上海銀錢兩公會，轉呈財政部核準施行。</p>
<p>該會組織，設執行委員七人（名單見本訊首段）。由此七人，互選常務委員三人，再由三人中，互選主席一人，常川到會主持會務。常委及主席人選，尚待以後召開執行委員會時選定。據觀測：李馥蓀將被選為常委兼主席，此外兩常委，一為國家銀行代表，一為錢業代表。至國家行局，前雖有不擬參加準備會之訊，茲以事實需要，或仍將考慮參加云。</p>

<h3>公司轉向香港登記　八月間達一七一家</h3>
<p>〔合眾社香港一日電〕據香港政府統計，八月間中國公司移香港登記營業者達一百七十一家。但某政府官員告合眾社記者稱，此數並不能代表將公司及投資自中國移來香港之公司之總數。又過去於馬來亞經營者，亦有若干移來香港，該官員指出，依照目前香港法律，港政府予以承認之公司共分三類，（一）香港公司，只準在香港營業者；（二）港華公司，即由香港控制，但在中國設立分行者；（三）中國公司，即在中國註冊，但可在香港營業者，其第二類，中國政府方面曾表示反對，香港政府最近亦或將其取消。</p>

<h3>紡建仍維持原盤　紗市漲風已稍殺　唯坯布因貨少軋升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週前紗布市面，因外匯變動，人心向榮，價格堅挺，加以各幫竟購，現貨奇缺，漲風更烈，後幸紡建開價始終維持原價，民營各廠亦能共體當局抑平物價意志，聯合開貨，漲勢稍遏，惟週六紡建所開細布，配給數量有限，市塲價格有加八千至九千收進者，蓋一般實用廠商，因時屆秋銷，紛紛收購，而來根缺乏，致使掮客任意掀抬，緣市塲人心，每多視紡建開貨之多少，為價格高落之標準，如某種紗布，紡建連續開出，市塲人心即行向下，價格亦低落，設紡建對某種紗布兩次不開，即人心向上，市價狂升，所以紡建如能盡量供給，價格勢必下游，日來廣幫吸胃漸淡，紡建對於非實用工廠開貨，限制加嚴，據市塲中人云，民營及紡建如能繼續搜集，切實合作，紗布必有跌無漲云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨日紗市先堅後軟，客幫買胃末懈，仍擇現貨添配，是以晨初各牌現貨咸做高三二萬元，旋以同行迫於銀根，出籠者眾，乃稍回平，然腳地殊穩，上午十時紡建循例掛牌，廿支及四十二支俱開，藍鳳價仍無變更，前者為一百十六萬，後者為一百九十萬，均屬外匯未調整前之市價</p>
<p>布市雖續升一二千元，但比上日之價已回挫不少，氣勢稍平，惟客方因外埠市面轉漲，故銷路漸活，加以紡建因存貨不充，坯布僅維持染廠，對於號家概未供應，故民營廠及小型及小型廠之坯布，日趨上升。</p>
<h3>銀根緊·金鈔跌　烚赤曾跌近二百萬關</h3>
<p>烚赤昨每況愈下，壓力及斬多並起，疲怯難振，晨開二〇六萬五，供過於求，壓力雖不見重，但因大勢不利，難於支持，自二〇七萬起逐漸下挫，惟初時尚形平和，是以十時後，中央銀行仍以二〇五萬五之價配給二〇一條，入後情形愈形冷落，需要頭襯者，不得不出以斬多求現，於是午刻已跌至二〇〇萬關口，午後漸告平穩，隔日交割回升至二〇三萬，結果較上週六跌落三萬，飾金念一萬五，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根普遍大緊，需求不易，息價自一角半至二角不等，午後更抬高少許。</p>
<p>外幣亦告盤低，處此環境，人心頗多過低之看法，自晨初三三四〇元賣價起，一再盤跌，中途在三三〇〇元關邊微有掙扎，午刻步降至三二七〇元以下，略告平定，午後金市回升，但因美鈔乃當日交割者，雖被帶上，但極有限，結果較上週六下跌七十元，對黃金之比價最近時軋至六一三元對十兩，最後仍在六二〇元強，港票鬆動逾恒，自七一〇元起始終缺少維持，最後降至六七〇元左右，結果較上週六跌二十五元，港匯六八〇元，印匯八四〇元，英匯一一〇〇〇元，對做甚少，美匯牌價無需要。</p>
<h3>銀根雖緊　節關無問題　退票較往日多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據中央銀行金融檢查處處長李立俠氏語記者稱：自政府調整匯率後，為平抑市面物價計，中央銀行之黃金，中國紡建公司之紗布，臺糖公司之食糖，市政府之食米，均應市面需要，而大量拋售。因此而陸續收回之鉅額法幣，均集中央銀行。同時，各商業行荘，以時值中秋節，例須將放出之頭襯，遂不無緊縮之感。據李氏推測：此次市面頭襯之緊縮，或更甚於六底。惟本市金融界，皆以六底為殷鑒，深具戒心。自六底後，放款及業務經營方針，已見慎重不少。故中秋節前頭寸雖緊，尚不致發生恐慌。</p>
<p>又據上海票據交換所息：該所平常交換票據退票金額，平均每日約為五十億元，日來以市面頭寸趨緊，退票金額，略見增加，每日約為八九十億元云。</p>

<h3>皖省啼笑錄</h3>
<p>— 本報甘日合肥訊　特約記者費超然</p>
<p>皖各縣民衆，普遍的被迫「南人北化」，食米改爲食麵，稍經喘息，同時，又以爲刀兵之後，杞憂重重，而昊天居然垂憐，大雨滂沱，應時而下，崗田圩田，不動水車，禾苗蓬勃，旱糧繁密而長，目下早稻已經上市，遲稻正在收割，農夫不用力耕田，今歲竟然實現了。</p>
<p>皖中皖南加倍豐收</p>
<p>皖中各縣，在三伏中，火傘高張，暑候酷熱，每日均達百度內外，終日汗流不止，固慼不耐！但是正在揚花的時期，禾苗得到了熱浪陣陣的　　，結實乃能特別的繁大，雖未能一禾雙穗，據老農言：可與民十六年的豐收並駕，因該年稻穗，達二百六十粒，細檢今歲圩稻，亦達此　，　粒飽滿，而允過之，換言之：即往年每田收穀十石，今年可以倍之，又據皖南各縣確息，豐收與皖中相埒，蕪湖，無爲等縣，沿江圩田，更有一禾兩穗之說。</p>
<p>農忙正殷米草漲價</p>
<p>皖中種田較多者，均在加緊雇人收割，每日工資，竟達五六千元，還須備魚肉酒飯，殷勤的招待，因全體動員的農忙，近日米草來源，乃因之斷絕，所以跌至每石三萬元的新米，又回漲至四萬元，跌至每担四千元的燃草，又回漲至五千元，但此係斷刀季的偶然現象；預料桂殿飄香時，米總可仍跌至三萬元以內，高與人齊的茂草價，亦必大跌。</p>
<p>皖北各縣化為澤國</p>
<p>苦樂若天淵的，要算是皖北了。准河，沙河，泉河，旣受了花園口黃水的溢灌，平了堤槽，而匝月的大雨傾盆，平地水深數尺，無法宣洩，又浸鬆了堤根，無土可掘，焉能搶救？於是各河轟轟然相繼潰決——，遍野的高粱，秫黍，雜糧等等，都被波臣一掃而空，穎上，霍邱，鳳台，壽縣各處，縱橫數百里，都成了一望無際的澤國，人畜廬舍，飄入了水晶宮，無數孑遺的災民，十九撫老携幼，外出就食，作了抗戰勝利後，鄭俠的流民。目下皖北主食的麥價，每石（四十斤）已進十萬大關，貧瘠民衆，何能受此生計上的高壓？頴上各縣黃災救濟委員會，近來紛紛成立，電省報災，不外乎，（一）請免征借本年軍賦公糧，（二）請撥三十三年續穀，就地賑濟，（五）請救濟分署，迅廢大股物資救濟，聞省府已准撥積穀救濟了，總算是災民短期的福音，但杯水車薪，仍　要各方另行設法，作廣泛的救濟。</p>
<p>阜陽决堤災情慘重</p>
<p>記者頃晤阜陽友人，據談：該縣黃災，較其他各縣，尤爲慘重！境內頴河，泉河，洪河，芡河，均以黃水浸灌，岳河口，洪河北岸，相繼潰決，七月初，又大雨兼句，平地積水數尺，西南各鄕，一片汪洋，田中的纍纍旱糧，全遭淹斃，生命財產損失，尤難統計！全縣一百〇四鄕鎭，受災者，達八十除，現有風餐露宿，無衣無食災民，達數十萬，鳩形鵠面，哀鴻遍地，死亡相繼，慘狀空前！日內聯合旅省同鄉，分赴省府，曁救濟分署呼籲：懇撥大量物資救濟，並請省參議會，登高一呼，倡導各縣募捐，以宏救濟。</p>
<p>連日雹雨田禾發芽</p>
<p>皖中美中不足的，是入秋以來，幾乎一日一陣雹雨，暑氣已被金風掃去大半，但是崗圩田積水，將浸到了稻穗，收割已發生了阻碍，田禾亦間生了嫩芽，倘天公再不作美，到口的糧食，恐將遭受大大的回扣。今日（甘日）黑雲潛形，紅日抬頭，各地民衆，無不額手稱慶！</p>
<p>代表呼籲借征大减</p>
<p>本省今秋征借總額，糧部原規定，按賦銀每元，征借各四斗，除省縣級公糧外，爲八百萬市石，幸經省參議會，公推年高德邵的高壽恒，熱心公益的金慰農等赴京，代表三千萬民衆，向中央作力竭聲　的呼籲。結果，接受了民意，將規定數字，大减特减，改定征三借一，另加省縣級公糧三成，總額爲五百三十九萬市石，高老等溽署長征，爲民造　，總算不虛此行。</p>
<p>縣處减少介人特多</p>
<p>至本省原有縣田糧處，爲五十一單位，上月經糧部，剔去征額本少縣份，核定只爲三十一單位，省處爲此事，大傷腦筋！因如遵令而行，改組田糧科·時期促迫，影響整個征收，倘暫爲保存，則甘個單位，龐大的薪補費，由何項籌付，現省處，正據情呈請糧部核示。省處長楊中明氏，幷於十八日赴京力爭，又省處爲調整人事，健全業務計，決定將合肥等十六縣處更換，人選擬擇素有操守，富有經騐者充任，聞各方函介人選，達二百餘，粥少僧多，幾令人擇不勝擇，現縣處人選發表者，己有合肥歙縣等十處，僅餘六處，正在逐鹿中。但爲全省民衆計，希望儘量打破悄面，愼擇操守素嚴者，達到裕國福民的目標扌好。</p>

<h3>家庭經濟制度</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>我國人向來對家庭經濟，無所謂制度，甚至迎獨資營業商店，也犯這毛病，以致沒有決算，更沒有預算，結果對生活方面，不免有過於浪費或捉襟見肘諸事實。欲補救此弊，應確立家庭經濟制度。</p>
<p>第一應記家用賬。記賬的好處，不但是收支明晳，而且核考支出，能感覺何者是浪用，何者是應用，何者可省儉，有決算，也可有預算，這正是健全家庭經濟的初步辦法。</p>
<p>第二應量入爲出。家庭不比政府是量出爲入，需用若干，要謀收入若干，以平衡收支。可是允其在上海，有好多人，抱着「今日有酒今日醉」，「千金散盡還復來」的能度，還有一般在淪陷時期慣作投機朋友，看賺錢太便當，用完了再說，可是現在環境不同，便因過去吃慣用慣，不免拮据起來，這便是爲不確立家庭經濟制度的緣故。</p>
<p>第三應劃分家庭與個人經濟。有人嫌了錢，只放在身邊，做妻子的不知丈夫每月薪入的多寡，如何的開支。要買小菜問丈夫拿，要買日用品問丈夫拿。在丈夫自由支配經濟之下，不論妻子兒女都沒有運用經濟的餘地·這麼一來，妻子往往報虛賬，想在丈夫的給予中，得些零用；而丈夫也往往欺騙妻，以希　達其省儉之目的，其實這不是最好的辦法。在一月的開始，做丈夫的，在預算家庭經常開支外，更應給予妻子以及兒女以適量的金錢。好讓妻子兒女自主地去分配零用。這不但可預算家庭的開支，並可養成兒女有使用金錢的知識。只要他不用於賭博以及不正當的行爲，更可練習妻子以及女兒的自尊心自主性，因爲能自由使用金錢，多少在精神上也是一種愉快啊！</p>
<h3>對待深夜不歸的丈夫　你該怎樣？</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>每個賢淑的主婦都希望有一個和諧甜蜜的美滿家庭，這是無容諱言的。但是假如不幸當你的丈夫深夜不歸時你將怎　樣呢？</p>
<p>一般的主婦們往往以吵鬧，盤問，怒目來對付他們。回來後不讓他安睡，逼他說出所以遲歸的原因；因爲　歸總不外乎正常的應酬交際或另有外遇把時間消應在女友的甜言語中。前者情有可原，後者却非嚴加訊問不可了，這是普通一班的見解，其實呢，錯處固在他們，但用這種方式來對付他們乎不不大聰明。</p>
<p>首先，我們得瞭的是夫妻間的和睦，親愛，是完全築於眞誠的情感上的；而情感的培養則基於相互間的愛護和體貼上。假如一方面厲聲相請怒目而視的話，那麼在維特夫婦間摯蜜的情感的大前提下，無疑的是失敗的一策——主婦們所以要採取這種嚴厲的手段來對付她們的丈夫是爲了要使他不敢在外有不規的行動，回心過來恢復以往的相愛。其實事實上這不單不會收到絲毫的效果反而會增加他們的憎恨和　惡，甚至終夜不歸！</p>
<p>聰明的主婦們萬一不幸遭遇到這種情形時，她一定肯以最大的忍耐和最深的情感來制止它。她內心所蘊藏着的苦痛和　酸決不表露在顏面和行動上。夜深了，大地寂靜無聲，在　　的孤燈下，她獨自倚在牀頭或坐在沙發上做丈夫的衣衫。時鐘有規律滴搭滴搭冷漢而又單調的擺聲敲着她悲悒的心房，然而她不失望，不悲觀，決心要等待丈夫的回來！終於門輕輕地被推開了，昏黑中丈夫躡手躡脚地走了進來。常他發覺他的妻子在這樣深的夜晚還倚在床頭爲他做衣等待他歸家的那一種深情，他一定會深深地感動。這時，她最好含一些疲倦的笑容站起來迎接他，竭力忍住內心的悲怨，對於他如此晚歸的原因隻字不問，反而溫柔體貼地問他可疲階？可要吃一些點心？快睡吧，身體要緊，明天還得辦公呢！一切像沒有事似的，他們安然地一同躺到床上。這時候，我可以知道，假如這一對夫婦在婚前是經過一段熱烈的戀愛時期的話，丈夫一定反覆地不能入眠，因爲那賢淑的夫人的柔愛，體貼，和寬懷會深深地激動他的心，使他憶起昔日那一段充滿着艱辛，苦難，甜蜜和辛酸的　史！他不該如此的無情·他不該再有犯罪的行爲，他會感到羞愧和內疚！假如一次不能打動他的心，我願你以最大的忍耐，含着淚去完成你的願望，你一定會成功的！倘然你的丈夫是一個有人性的人的話·他不單會丟去他的邪念，反而因你的仁慈，深情，和體貼而加倍的愛戀你崇敬你。</p>
<p>你看過美麗動人的翠堤春曉（The　Great　Waltz）那張影片嗎？那溫柔淑慧的的翰，司屈勞斯（Johann　Strauss）夫人就是以最眞摯的情感和忍耐使她的丈夫拋棄了歌后卡拉而重新日到她的懷抱中的！</p>
<h3>「飲食數則」補遺</h3>
<p>— 步雲</p>
<p>近年來，營養科學的進步已改變了一般人對於食物的觀念。有些硏究的發現，甚至於連科學家他們自己也感驚奇，有些呢？你也許會說：「怎麼？我一向是以爲如此的！」</p>
<p>（一）烤牛肉該在半熟時吃，因爲那味厚的紅色液汁能補血的。</p>
<p>那味厚的紅色液汁是沒有特殊價値的。你喜歡怎麼吃你的牛肉就怎麼吃，只要別把它燒成焦塊就行了。</p>
<p>（二）糖，是最能生長能力（Energy）的食物。</p>
<p>除了鹽和水之外，一切平常食物，都能生熱能的。這熱能是以卡羅里（Calories），或稱「熱的單位」去衡量的。不過這種熱能和普通人所想像中的所謂精力和耐久力毫無關係。糖，不過是和別種簡單的炭化合物一樣：容易消化，和化學上熱能很快就能滲入血液以供人體使用的食物。</p>
<p>（三）魚是補腦的食物。</p>
<p>魚是　燐質的，腦組織也含燐質。魚內所含燐質和牛乳，牛排等等所含質，都一樣能達到腦組織，和人體其他含　的部份如：神經組織和牙齒裏而去的。</p>
<p>（四）炒之物最難爲胃所消化。</p>
<p>仔細的硏究下來，找不出這種普遍的見解證據來。脂肪滯留在胃中的時間，固然較其他食物爲久。但這不是不能消化之謂，煎蛋和煮蛋是同樣的容易消化。油煎餅及油　餅　面所含的脂肪，和同量的脂肪用別種方式烹調來吃的食物，是同樣的容易被消化，吸收的。</p>
<p>（五）將酸性的食物和牛乳同時吃是危險的，因爲酸會把牛乳凝結起來，像草莓和牛乳，便不可同食。</p>
<p>假如你能把兩種食物先後分食，那末你也能把它們混合了吃。假如菓酸不能凝結牛乳，你的胃酸還是要把牛奶凝成塊的。</p>
<p>（六）飲多量的牛乳可防止牙齒蛀蝕。</p>
<p>飲多量的牛乳是有益的，但是大多數牙齒已生蛀洞的飲者會否認這種信念。牛乳雖然是鈣和燐——齒體中所含的主要礦質————的最大來源，但是要這兩種礦質結含成這完整的牙齒還需要些旁的元素，而這種元索在你的食物巾却也許沒有。</p>
<p>（七）不要把飯和水同時吃。</p>
<p>除非你是不嚼飯而和水吞下。水，根本不會冲淡你胃中的東西。它一下子就由胃中流出了，而且馬上就被大腸收去了。</p>
<p>（八）麥麵包比白麵包來得營養</p>
<p>白麵包是更容易消化；以乳酪和精製麵粉製成，它是各種礦質，維他命，炭水化合物和熱能主要來源。麥麵包　然含有麥粒原有的許多賽貴元素和　助排洩作用的粗纖維質，不過粗纖維質之於過敏的消化器官是不十分容易忍受的。兩種麵包都是同樣的十分合於滋養的食料。</p>
<p>（九）食物中所含天然的維他命</p>
<p>要比人工製成的維他命來得優越。</p>
<p>所有已知的維他命，無論是在天然食物內，或藥丸內，化學上的成份是沒有分別的。雖然有很多種食物裘面也許含有至今還區別不出來的某種未知維他命，再加上其仙物質，因此對於　養上很佔重要，人造維他命確是最好的補助劑。</p>
<h3>小家庭</h3>
<p>— 墨萍</p>
<p>——最低限度生活費——</p>
<p>以一夫一妻及一四五歲小兒之家庭爲例：</p>
<p>一、房租，破舊之樓房一小間，每月租金二萬元。</p>
<p>二、米每月每人以二斗計，小孩折半，是每月需米半石。現時米價，每月六萬元，半石　　萬元。</p>
<p>三、　錢，每月吃輩一次，平日皆食素菜，每日菜錢平均一千元。（豆腐四塊，冬瓜一斤，靑菜一斤）。</p>
<p>四、油鹽醬醋，每月限五千元。（菜油五斤，鹽一斤，醬油二斤，醋三百元）。</p>
<p>五、煤炭費，每月燒煤球兩　，一萬六千元，木柴引火用三</p>
<p>六、肥皂，牙膏，每月値二千元。</p>
<p>七、草紙，每月需一千元。</p>
<p>八、小孩點心及大人早點，最低限度每日一千元。</p>
<p>九、報紙、每份一百五十元，每月需四千五百元。</p>
<p>十、郵票，每月五百元。</p>
<p>十一、上辦公室電車錢，每月七千元。</p>
<p>十二、茶葉，火柴，每月茶葉一兩一百元。每五日火柴一盒一百元，每月共需六百元。</p>
<p>十三、關於零用方面，姑以最低劣之香烟，每包二百元計，每二日一包，每月已需三千元。再加上不得已之應酬，及　買信封信零星用品等，每月估二萬元，共二萬三千元。</p>
<p>十四、襯衣，皮鞋，毛巾，襪子，童鞋等等每年限制三十萬元（此數祗敷每人添製布衣二件，皮鞋兩雙，童鞋三雙，襪子五六雙，及毛巾）平均每月二萬五千元。</p>
<p>共計每月費用二十萬零六百元，此數實爲二口中半的小家庭一個月最低限度之生活費用。然而在小公務員看來，恐怕仍將是一個奢侈的數目呢。</p>
<h3>妻子需要帮助</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>——狄斯女士信箱之一——</p>
<p>親愛的狄斯女士：</p>
<p>你以爲我是錯了嗎？在一個星期日的早晨，去要求我的丈夫給予一些帮助。</p>
<p>一星期裏，我的丈夫祗有五天需要工作，每大也祗有八小時，但每天傍晚回來以後，也祗是自顧地進餐，讀報和休息；星期日他又確定地拒絕給我一些帮助，他說：這天是上帝所規定給他的休息日。</p>
<p>我們己有了一個剛滿二月的孩子，不時的需要照料；所以我除了一天到晚要做家事烹飪以外，還要看管這樣的一個孩子，使我感到十分疲勞；因此我要求他在星期日來整理一下我們的家，但是他却堅決地拒絕了。</p>
<p>過後他又說孩子不需要過度的看護時，希望我也能得到一個位置而出去工作。</p>
<p>是不是我錯了？因爲我懷疑丈夫已不愛我了！　曼琪上</p>
<p>曼琪女士：</p>
<p>顯明地，你的丈夫是一個更愛他自己的男子，他旣不考慮到別人的快樂也不給人予安慰的。</p>
<p>他可能是有一顆良好的心，來對待你的，但或許祗是因爲你能像一雙任怨任勞的好馬。所以這是不足使他伸出手來帮助你的。</p>
<p>你的丈夫是祗有五天工作着，換句話說，就是有二整天空間和僅是四十小時的工作。你呢？差不多是整天的工作，沒有星期日也沒有例假日，像那首著名的詩上寫着的一樣：</p>
<p>「男子們完畢他的工作，從日出到日落；女子們呢？有的是永遠不完的工作。」</p>
<p>當你想到一個男子和一個女子的這樣不平衡的工作，你一定奇怪，女人們竟忍受了這麼長的時問，從不想放下手來罷工要求一個比較短的工作時間，讓男子們也爲「母性」分任一些培養兒童的重務；可能的話，洗碟子或揩一下地板罷！</p>
<p>她們是會勝利的，因爲這世界上的一切將要停止止前進了。要是一天沒有人預備食物，扶育孩子，整理一個家庭　的一切的話。</p>
<p>但是他能夠說一些碗，或是帶着孩子到外面去玩，使這一小時內。再沒有孩子來吊住媽媽的頸項，也並不是一個丈夫給予妻子的至高無上的愛：</p>
<p>不過一個丈夫眞愛他的妻子，他當想應該會時時設法來减輕一個母性所負的重任的！</p>

<h3>爵士樂的功過是非</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>“Jazz　Music”在中文被譯作「爵士音樂」，看字面似乎很高貴，其實這只是譯音，原意並沒有說：「這是爵士們的音樂」。相反的，它是第一次歐戰前流行於南美，據說是黑人的創作品。至今，黑人的舞蹈音樂，依然是道地的「爵士」。</p>
<p>如果依中國的俗樂雅樂而言，「爵士」該屬於俗樂。它的特性是輕松·活潑·熱鬧·刺激，富有肉慾的誘惑。托爾斯泰所反對的音樂，主要的也就是指這種音樂。這類音樂的產生由於人們的「過分放任」的熱情。至於爵士之所以成為爵士，則因為樂曲的結構純粹利用了急速的節奏，油滑的旋律，熱鬧的和聲，它利用了「切分法」，利用了明顯的節奏。為什麼說它富有肉慾的誘惑呢？我個人的解釋是如此：一個曲子，能刺激聽者精神的，常是旋律幽婉，節奏不太急速，不太明顯，感情深刻，而某些地方略覺沉悶的音樂；它令人心靈沉浸某種思索或記憶與憧憬中；相反的，一個曲子要令人手舞足蹈，四肢膨脹，要激動聽者的肉體的，必須是節奏強而明顯，節拍急而速的音樂，舞曲和進行曲都在此例。我們並不是說節拍急速的曲子，都不及節拍緩慢的曲子，不過如果專門強調肉感上的過分的興奮，而使當時的音樂與舞蹈，成為純粹的聲色歡娛，那麼這些藝術就缺乏藝術的成分了。修芒說「最高的藝術與道德一致」，也可以說明音樂不容走向「低級的放縱。」</p>
<p>美國人生活太富裕，特別喜歡爵士音樂。但爵士之被攻擊，卻與它的流行成正比例。記得有一次美國某電臺請名指揮易脫比指揮爵士音樂，易氏一面指揮一面痛恨，結果到了半途，他竟而停住了，向聽眾宣佈：「諸位，這不是音樂，我幹不了，我不能傷害你們的聽覺！」</p>
<p>到處，我們可以聽到討伐爵士樂的聲音，但爵士樂不能消滅。打開天窗說亮話，許多名樂家，有時候也喜歡弄爵士，名提琴家海菲斯，名指揮托斯尼尼，都會演奏或指揮爵士。不過，應該指出的：中國爵士與外國爵士又有不同，爵士的花樣同樣需要技巧，例如在Saxphon裏表現出笑的聲音，非很高技巧，不能達到。據國立音專校長戴先生說，他在維也納時，聽過當地正統樂家的演奏爵士，技巧實在令人欽佩！</p>
<p>目前，上海音樂協會曾經邀集了中外樂家討論上海的舞塲音樂問題。結果他們對爵士也沒有定論，奏者水準太低，大家都認為那簡直是四不像。至對於比較可取的爵士，他們也沒有抹煞其有着接近大眾的優點，但在目前的中國，爵士不需要。他們的結論是：爵士可以「批評地接受」。</p>
<p>以上拉雜話，只是介紹爵士的概略，以言其功過是非，我仍無法同情它。正如陳洪先生所說「技巧為了表達內容而存在，內容不好，技巧何用。」所以，爵士技巧雖尚不無可取，但它的本質，實胑是與美國胡調的千篇一律的，五彩歌舞片一樣的東西！至於在上海舞塲裏的音樂，則連爵士都不配！</p>
<h3>看雲小想</h3>
<p>— 徹</p>
<p>久困於沙漠的枯脊，想到江南一訪小橋流水；但是當一機降落在江灣機塲之後，墜在上海煩囂的塵綱裏匆匆地過了將近一年，幾乎已忘記了除去人造的狡猾的流線型汽車和塗指抹粉的醜婦般的高樓大廈外，更有自然用天工造就的世界</p>
<p>只有一次在京滬路上的臥車裏，燈火昏黃，窗帷半掩，看到外面沉重地睡在的濃綠的田野，深深地呼吸着夏夜的氣息，月光如水，照在青蒼的植物上，照進車子的窗戶裏，才懷想許多遙遠地像一幅幅輕紗的景物，遙遠地像一個個影子的友人的面貌……但不久就在一天奔波的疲勞中熟睡了。</p>
<p>又有一次在Lassie　Come　Home影片中，浸在戲院的冷氣裏，看着蘇格蘭草原中森林的景物，那是如次熟稔如此親切，透過濃密的樹葉的陽光，把這些林木照得如此晶瑩，如此玲瓏剔透，將和誰在那裏面騎馬奔馳一番呢……但散戯出來卻是又在燥熱的驕陽裏。</p>
<p>今晨，偶然抬頭從窗戶裏向上望去，看見天空是那樣地蔚藍，一縷縷鬈髮一樣的白雲，嫵媚地飄着像一片白帆；我恍然覺得這些已經闊別了許久許久，難道我已經一年沒有望過天空嗎？…</p>
<p>熱中於富貴功名，固然會使終南都變成市朝，但即使醉心於工作事業卻也可使人逐漸趨於庸俗，而一個庸俗的人，真能永遠着眼於工作事業，而不把手段當做目的，去追逐功名利祿嗎？毫厘之差，是常不可以謬之以千里的</p>
<p>朋友們常常奇怪我的不會抽煙和不會喝酒，但在過去，我卻有抽煙和喝酒的需要呢？在邊遠的地方，做着開荒的作業，生活裏夠有太多的夢想，太多的情趣，我何需於煙酒？</p>
<p>但在今後該要「偷得浮生半日閑」來學一學煙酒了，也許飄渺的煙圈會引我抬頭向天空，給我一線夢想；也許濃洌的醇酒會使我離開糾纏的實際生活，給我一點高遠的情趣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風21</p>
<p>我的腦海正像一鍋煮沸了的水，亂翻亂騰，簡直不知道應該怎樣答覆他。</p>
<p>「您伏在這兒別動；要不，退到山裏去！」說着，人已經走了，迅疾輕捷得像一隻山貓。</p>
<p>我覺得遍體顫憟起來，不知是興奮還是慚愧；週身血管脹得要爆裂一樣，腦門和兩旁的太陽穴　憧的響着，一顆心好像浮了起來，咽喉覺得有火燒着，乾燥極了。</p>
<p>竭盡我的目力，我看見小老虎一躍上了公路，對準卡車，祗跑了幾步，一抬胳膊，一顆子彈已經離膛，好像對着卡車射擊。第二響，那車頭頂上的燈，已經熄了。一會兒車前的燈也滅了，公路上已成了黑漆一片。接着聽得卡車上有盒子砲的聲音酬答着對方的步槍，一下一下，似乎很有韻律，可始終總不見我那　　　　　　。</p>
<p>從傷兵口裏，我知道他們是張自忠將軍部下，保衛着從廊房到直門這一帶地區；已經跟鬼子幹了幾次了，「都是鬼鬼崇崇的；偷襲一陣就逃；自己各防區也沒聯絡，鬼子來了，就上前去堵一下；聽說宋（哲元）總司令不願打，咱們的長官也沒法下令叫打，咱們只好挨揍」！</p>
<p>車夫們十幾個受傷，不太重。二十二位傷兵，給這九個委軍幹掉了八個。我叫車夫們跟我們一起進城，他們　　了一陣，決定了辦法；傷了的，管自拉車子回家；沒有傷的，還要回到前線去，因為那兒根本沒有多少担架隊。……</p>
<p>「回頭見，您哪」！沒有受傷的幾個，拉起了車子，給我打着招呼。為了要救護那些守衛祖國每寸山河的勇士們，這小小的行列，又鼓起勇氣，踏着有力的步伐，趕到前線去了。</p>
<p>「老伯…」！一會兒孩子跑回來了，滿頭滿臉大汗；衣服，一件藍布短袖襯衫，也汩得貼在身上，手中提着一枝馬槍，最新德式的十二響，大概是「皇軍」御用的。</p>
<p>「咱們好走了嗎」？他微笑着，可也帶着些緊張。微笑是安慰我的；緊張的神情，大約是害怕又出岔子。我一面開動了車，一面簡短的告訴了他這裏的經過。</p>
<p>「老總們儘開快車，別管咱們，咱們可以岔小道回家，不怕——」受了傷的車夫們拉着車，一蹶一跛的走着，看見我們卡車開得慢，有護衛他們的意思。</p>
<p>「七個，赶車的不算——當地四個，就在這車上使車夫的盒子砲打的；追着三個，使這隻長銃子幹的，還有幾個散開走了，——您知道，我噤得見他們，他們可噤不見我哪」！他頑皮的笑了；一邊客氣的讓着我，一邊自己大口吃着口袋裏躦下的　　蛋糕。</p>
<h3>風波（小說）</h3>
<p>— 石琪</p>
<p>王長發走進正陽樓支那料理，就　着門窗口，把屁股安放在櫈子上，便用力的把桌子一拍：</p>
<p>「堂倌！」</p>
<p>堂倌匆忙的背着一條油布跑過來？</p>
<p>「太爺，您要？……」</p>
<p>王長發瞪着一對眼珠子往堂倌的臉上轉呀轉的猛的立起來！</p>
<p>「拍」的一個耳光子搧在堂倌的臉上：</p>
<p>「媽拉個巴子，你做生意的，一點規矩也不懂！」</p>
<p>堂倌被打得臉上忽剌剌的發熱，翻起眼來，把油布往後一曳：</p>
<p>「奶奶的，你打，你打人……」</p>
<p>「打，我就打你這雜種！」</p>
<p>王長發霍的站起來，一把扭住堂倌的耳朶，一隻手就像搧扇子般的往別人臉上上搧。</p>
<p>「拍，拍，拍，拍！」</p>
<p>「我就打你這雜種，我要教訓教訓你！」</p>
<p>帳桌子那面坐着的帳房先生扯扯坐在旁邊的老　的袖子：</p>
<p>「掌櫃的，李四這回可倒了斜霉了，怎麼不長個眼珠子，這關東州著名的特務王長發你也好得罪？」</p>
<p>掌櫃的把舌頭伸出來半天縮不回去。</p>
<p>「這就是王長發，媽拉個巴子，我這店也倒了斜霉？先生，勞你駕，你去勸勸！」</p>
<p>賬房先生摸摸頭，站起來，又坐下，望望掌櫃的。</p>
<p>掌櫃的不住的作揖：</p>
<p>「勞你駕，先生，等會我請客，你祗當是可憐我！」</p>
<p>那邊李四被人揪着耳朶像拍皮球般的打着：</p>
<p>「哎呦，哎呦，哎呦……」</p>
<p>怪可憐的，賬房先生無奈的站起來，兩步湊成三步的蹭過去，不敢用手扯王長發，卻咬着牙，恨恨的往李四的臉上一巴掌。</p>
<p>「你這生意越做越回去了，整天在店裏我怎麼教你來着，這是話，王大爺我們請都請不來，你眼睛瞎了？」底下又是一腳：</p>
<p>「滾，給我捲鋪蓋滾蛋！」</p>
<p>一面趕緊又轉過身來，不住的鞠着躬：</p>
<p>「王大爺，您大人不見小人怪，這夥計是剛來，他規矩不懂，您瞧，我太疏忽，儘顧記賬，您王大爺進來我就沒有看見……」</p>
<p>又是一鞠躬。</p>
<p>王長發好容易讓賬房先生推着坐在櫈子上，扳着臉：</p>
<p>「掌櫃的，你會做生意！」</p>
<p>賬房先生就鞠着躬：</p>
<p>「好說，王大爺，做生意有做生意的規矩！……」</p>
<p>王長發把桌子一拍：</p>
<p>「你也懂得規矩！」手往窗外一指：</p>
<p>窗外面的地上不知道是誰，吃完了飯不能消化，吐了一地，滿地都是白米飯顆粒，就像誰在那裏傾了一碗白米稀飯。</p>
<p>「你曉得關東州親視東洋人不準中國人吃白米？」</p>
<p>賬房先生心裏不住的打鼓，不知道是那個三孫子在這裏闖禍，這幾年日本人的禍害還沒有受夠？</p>
<p>肚子裏想着，身子可還不住的鞠躬。</p>
<p>「回您王大爺的話，小店裏可不敢賣白米，這是規矩，您王大爺沒有不聖明的，我去給您查，給您查……」</p>
<p>說着說着，腳底下一滑，像駕了飛機似的奔了出去……。</p>
<p>店裏有一陣紊亂，掌櫃的，堂倌，都奔了出去……。</p>
<p>半天，半天，帳房先生趄趄趦趦的走了進來，把嘴巴湊在王長發的耳邊上，滴滴咕咕的好半天，然後蹲下來請一個安：</p>
<p>「求您王大爺賞我一個臉！」</p>
<p>王大爺擺了一下，點點頭：</p>
<p>「我可是要捉住賣米的！」</p>
<p>帳房先生立刻就搶過去：</p>
<p>「那自然，那自然，祗求您不辦吃的人，我叫他們帶您去，保您捉住！」</p>
<p>就往門口招招手，一個人一溜煙的跑過來。</p>
<p>「快給王大爺請安。」那個就規規矩矩的請一個安：</p>
<p>「謝謝王大爺，我帶王大爺去。」</p>
<p>王大爺把三角眼往那人身上楞一下：</p>
<p>「你叫什麼？」</p>
<p>「回王大爺的話，我叫謝恩！」</p>
<p>「謝恩你可不準撒謊！」</p>
<p>謝恩就再請一個安：</p>
<p>「不敢，王大爺！」</p>
<p>王長發高興的站起來，拍拍帳房先生的肩膀？</p>
<p>「好小子，有你一功！」</p>
<p>把手指向謝恩一曳：</p>
<p>「走！」</p>
<p>謝恩就規規矩矩的走在前面，把王長發帶了出去。</p>
<p>帳房先生舒了一口氣，往帳桌子上一坐，把眼睛得意的往掌櫃的身上　一下：</p>
<p>「可算把這魔王請出去了！」</p>
<p>掌櫃的諂媚的：</p>
<p>「虧你，先生，我做東！」仰起脖來叫：</p>
<p>「灶上的給先生添四盤，整齊點，再來半斤白乾！」</p>
<p>帳房先生就把頭往牆上一靠，閉上眼睛，就好像已經吃過半斤酒似的那麼興奮：</p>
<p>「這，這一回，嗯，折着了米，嗯……」</p>
<p>掌櫃的嘆一口氣：</p>
<p>「梁大嫂也怪可憐，……」</p>
<p>帳房先生搖着頭：</p>
<p>「大丈夫，做事檔手很心毒……」</p>
<p>沒有說下去，這時候謝恩同了王長發正在拍梁大嫂的大門。</p>
<p>「梁大嫂，是我，謝恩：」</p>
<p>王長發往牆邊一閃，門豁搭開開，謝恩怱心的縱進去：</p>
<p>「有米，梁大嫂？」</p>
<p>「你要幾半？不過要漲價了！」</p>
<p>王長發陡的闖出來：</p>
<p>「好，私賣白米，東洋人……」</p>
<p>他抬起頭來，面前一個俏麗的女人的臉，圓圓的一對大眼睛瞪着，他差一點沒有暈過去：</p>
<p>「是你？」</p>
<p>由裏房走出來一個半老太婆，怪安詳的：</p>
<p>「王大爺，這是三太太的本錢，自己人捉自己家裏來了！」</p>
<p>那女人，那叫做梁大嫂的，把小腳一跥，一頭扎到王長發的懷裏：</p>
<p>「你捉，你捉，你也敢捉我，不定又讓那裏的狐貍精迷住了，今天晚上你也不用想上我的炕！」</p>
<p>王長發楞在那裏，忽然清醒過來似的，跳過去重重的賞了謝恩一個嘴巴子：</p>
<p>「你還不給我滾蛋！」</p>

<h3>夜哭</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>午夜歸家，帶着一身疲乏，滿望有個安靜的睡眠，却　在這個時候，隣家聲聲傳來小兒的啼哭，在寗謐的深夜，像浮雕般凸現得格外淸晰，使人難以入寐。</p>
<p>天雨花，鬼夜哭，爲傳說中社會一種噩耗的朕象，小兒夜啼，祗是家宅不安而已。然而無論如何，家長之未能善視共兒童，以致發生此不健康的病態，這總是鐵的事實。但是，做父兄的往往却去在市街牆壁電桿柱上遍貼這樣的招帖：「天皇皇，地皇皇，我家有個夜啼郎，走路君子唸一遍，一覺睡到大天光」，而不去尋醫服藥，這一愚昧行徑，正不知犧牲了若干可寳貴的小生命。</p>
<p>兒童的生理機能脆弱，受不起一絲絲侵襲，而在不舒服，不滿足，以及病痛等等的情形之下，也祗有用哭來表達痛楚，這和成人又大不相同了。</p>
<p>「沒有長夜痛哭過的人，不足以語人生」。成人的哭泣，是並不僅僅限於病痛的。嫠婦夜哭，其悲慘我們不難想像的。</p>
<p>不如意事常八九，可與人言無二三，我們如果午夜夢廻，躺在床上想想日間一切，大槪不想哭的人其數甚少罷，可惜不能像病痛的孩子一樣，能恣意縱情，往往祗是無聲之哭罷！</p>
<h3>飛機發明人　賴特兄弟的成名</h3>
<p>— 蕃甫</p>
<p>「我對世界和平，比未來的航空事　業更關心！」——奧維里賴特在最　近七十五歲誕辰中說。</p>
<p>一八七一年，美國俄亥俄州誕生了兩個寂寂無名的人物·威爾伯·賴特和他的弟弟奧維里·賴特。</p>
<p>賴特兄弟爲了家境貧寒，當孩提時代便已嘗到人間的苦楚，生活迫使他們去思索營生的方法，六七歲時，這兄弟倆整日跑到廢物，垃圾堆中，從裏面揀出獸骨和廢銅，將這些東西分別賣給肥皂廠，舊貨店，易錢度日。他們入學很遲，祗完成小學的教育。後來，用勤儉積聚所得，開設了一聞小規模的自由車行。</p>
<p>中途棄學，本來事出不得已，遇有空閒，兩兄弟必定取出書本閱讀。有一天，奧維里在一所公共圖書館裏看書，讀到了德國科學家李林紫所作的文字，述說他正在設計一個風箏式的滑板，和它如何可以凌空升起的理論，這個叙述與理解，引起奧維里絕大的興趣，當夜他一連做了幾個相同的夢：他坐在一個滑板裏，它凌虛升在空中，彷彿就如烏雀一樣。</p>
<p>經過兄弟倆共同硏究，努力，奧維里的夢變成了人類的奇蹟：一九〇三年十二月十七日，十時三十五分的時刻，奧維里爬入那一架原始的飛機裏，解開繩纜以後，機件冒出濃烟，發出沉重的軋軋聲響，接着便直衝向前，升在半空，歷時十二秒鐘，然後降落在一百公尺外的平地上，這就是世界上第一架飛機起飛的經過。當時奧維里，年紀祗有三十二歲。</p>
<p>之後，賴特兄弟更埋頭作複葉機的硏究，卒吿成功。兩人便在美國及海外作空中旅行。一九〇九年，法國「學士會社」贈給賴特兄弟一紙發明獎狀。一九一五年，賴氏兄弟將在故鄕台頓城，一手創立的「賴特飛機公司」全部機利賣掉，却担任該公司　問技師的職位。同年，美國海軍部聘任賴特兄弟爲顧問。</p>
<p>上月底奧維里·頓特在美歡度七十五歲的誕辰。在誕辰中，他說，他對於世界和平比未來的航空事業更關心。——當然，飛機被利用爲殺人利器，原非他始料所及也。</p>

<h3>比例</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>我有個朋友在×小學教　，他祖任的科目是高級的算術，學生們對於比例問題，未能澈底了解，他於是引用簡明的，喻：「譬如現在社會上，做大官的發大財，做小官的發小財，叫正比例，又如工作最忙的人，賺錢最少，工作最聞的人，賺錢最多，叫反比例。……」</p>
<h3>電子顯微鏡</h3>
<p>— 張文忠</p>
<p>——科學常識——</p>
<p>據塔斯社列寗格勒上月十二日電稱：可將物體放大四五萬倍之電子顯微鏡，已在此間完成，該鏡爲紅色近衛工廠所造，用作微生物硏究之用云云。所謂「電子顯微鏡」，恐尙爲我們不大熟悉之名詞，茲特簡略將該鏡製造原理介紹如下</p>
<p>查現時日常所用之顯微鏡，都是用各種不同之凸凹透鏡組成，利用它的曲折度，可將物體放大至二千倍，此外不常見的一種顯微鏡，是用人眼所不能見的超紫光綫，將物體影像投攝於感光版上，然後用藥液顯影，用這種顯微鏡，能將物體放大至五千倍。</p>
<p>現在這種所謂「電子顯微鏡」，原爲德國發明，美國亦緊隨於後，現俄國亦能自造。說起來它的外表並不怎樣動人，只是一個高的六尺半的圓柱體，可以放在桌上。上面裝有把手及指針，內部是眞空，以便電子自由活動。在圓柱項上裝有細鎢絲，當電流通過時，即發生電子電流，在細鎢絲下面施以不同的電壓，以促使電子電流增加下流的速度。再下面是磁石塲，它可使電子電流曲折而聚成焦點。在焦點上裝有螢光板，而所欲放大的物體經過電子光綫，即投影於此板上，以便觀察。惜此種光綫對生物有害，故只能攝成像片觀察。但因未用光綫攝影，故不能稱爲像片，科學家另爲提名曰「電子顯是像」。</p>
<p>在電子顯微鏡下，我們能見到各種病菌的眞相，因之能進而研究其致病之由。工業家用了電子顯微鏡，對於水泥之製造已有改進，礦界正在用電子顯微鏡硏究有害礦工健康之礦產。化學　在電子顯微鏡下，看到了各種原質的分子　成，因而對有機化學造成了驚人的進步，結果使我們得到了人造玻璃，人造絲，及人造橡皮的享受。</p>
<p>科學家又吿訴我們，只要一百萬弗打電壓，促使電子每秒鐘流動十七萬五千哩，就可以看到比分子還小的不可思臆的「原子」。造成百萬弗打電壓，並不　不可能之事，所以電子顯微鏡的前途，正方興未艾。然而我們若老是拭目以待或坐享其成，永遠總要落人之後啊！</p>
<h3>目睹怪狀</h3>
<p>— 冷眼</p>
<p>八月甘五甘六兩日×大第二批新生入學考試，考塲中咄咄怪事，令人啼笑皆非，爲該大學有史以來所罕見。姑述一二如下：</p>
<p>第三堂考公民時試題較爲新頴，而大批××同學，因感下筆辣手，遂由×××登高一呼：「今天試題難不難」全體曰：「難」：繼呼曰：「難！大家就不考，大家去質問這試題是誰出的」，時人聲嘩然，相率退出考塲，秩序大亂，監考員　然不知所措，呆若木雞，繼見聲勢洶洶，竟抱頭竄逸而去。</p>
<p>有某主試未佩紅布條之「主試」字樣，昂然步入考塲，反遭某應考生詢問：「你是誰」？「你懂不懂試塲的規則「？你是擾亂我們的秩序」……一大串言語，弄得主試莫名其妙，面紅耳赤，忙從袋中拿出條子來佩上。</p>
<h3>福爾摩斯從那里來（5）</h3>
<p>— 斯道衰著郁強譯</p>
<p>這代理人寡請了兩位英國文人：一位是叫吉耳（Glll）的多言的議員，他的筆名是王爾德；另一位是從朴資茅斯來的窮醫生，柯南·道爾·王爾德談笑風生。兩位愉快的作家，即席承諾替利賓考特雜誌撰文。後來，王爾德寫了「道良，格累之　」（The　Picture　of　DorianGray南道爾的作品是「四簽名」（TheSign　of　Four）文中描寫福爾　斯，和華生一起，一度走入倫敦的霧中，偵查暴行與謀殺。</p>
<p>書單行本出版於一八九〇年秋季，是史本塞·皮拉開特發行的。這版本在今日也是稀罕而難覓的·可是版稅的收入，不敷作者的需用，柯南·道爾還繼續在南海行醫。</p>
<p>謙卑的人，並且始終是個行醫的人，當他們職業沒有收入時，他便寫小說。一八九〇年的下半年他計劃使他的兩種職業快樂的結合起來。</p>
<p>他想，要是做一個專門醫生，他便會有餘暇寫作，且能有大羣的病人；因此，他決定到維也納去學專科醫術！骰子擲下了，在歲尾，柯南·道爾醫生和他的太太關閉了叢林別　的門戶。今天，在那裏，釘着一塊「道爾房子」的匾額，是一處旅行家關注的地方。那裏，也可說是歇洛克·福爾摩斯的誕生地。</p>
<p>春季裏，他在維也納的學　完成了，一方眼科專家的　子釘在帝文州塲的一扉門上，一段新的患難開始了·「每天早晨」柯南·道爾後來寫道：一我從蒙太格塲的家中走出來，十點鐘到達我的診所，一直坐至三四點　，從未有鈴聲　亂我的安靜·」</p>
<p>正宜於從事文審工作。當時，有許多盛銷的月刊，開始在報攤上出現了，著名的Strand雜誌，亦是其中之一。依多　的吸烟的醫生看起來，長篇通載的小說刋在這類雜誌上是否適宜的，但是以單一的主角穿插其間的連續短篇小說却是非常適宜的·而很幸運的，這個主角就在手頭。於是，帝文州塲二號的眼科專家，柯南·道爾醫生，在長時間的等候中，開始寫他的著名的連　短　　探小說，這就是現在聞名全球的「福爾摩斯探案大全·」（The　Advenures　sherlock　Holnes）</p>
<p>現在，福爾摩斯在世界站定脚了。那個削瘦而堅強的人物變成了與納爾遜紀念碑和倫敦塔同樣熟悉的標誌。那人物是如此不可思議的深入民間，他生存在歷史中較當代的戰士與政治家更爲結實·一個幻影是如此眞實，正如羅納爾德·諾克斯神父（Fothor　Ronald　Knox）曾經愉快的啓示：有一天會有人在天堂中　也，忘廢了他僅是一本　是的人物而已。</p>

<h3>勝利後一年中　遺送日僑俘工作</h3>
<p>去年八月十五日，日皇裕仁的投降廣播，宣佈了黷武者最後的命運·留華十載的百萬悍將驕兵，頓時黯然低頭，成爲唯命是聽的俘虜。根據中國戰區，中國陸軍總司令部受降報吿：日俘·日僑的總數，共爲二百十三萬八千三百五十三人，內分日軍一百甘五萬五千人，日僑七十八萬四千九百七十四人，韓僑五萬六千六百六十五人，台胞四萬一千七百十四人。</p>
<p>十月甘五日，中·美雙方有關當局，在上海召開第一次遣送日僑俘會議，議定中國戰區日本官兵僑民遣送歸國計劃，支配中·美兩方分擔的工作，規定日軍民回國應行遵守各事項。計劃中擬以中國大陸·台灣·海南島和越北，爲日俘集中地點，而分由塘沽·靑島·連雲港·土海·厦門·汕頭·廣州·海口·三亞（以上兩港口皆在海南島）·海防·基隆·高雄等十二港口乘輪歸日。內遝工作由我方擔任，海遝部份則由美軍協助。</p>
<p>本年一月五日，「中美聯合遺送日人會議」在上海舉行，會議中指出自卅五年一月一日起，集合各地待遣送之日人數量爲：</p>
<p>（地名）　（人數）</p>
<p>台灣　四九二·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>海防　三一·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>海口　三〇·八五〇人</p>
<p>三亞　一〇·〇〇〇人</p>
<p>連雲港　一一四·八五〇人</p>
<p>靑島　一〇二·八〇〇人</p>
<p>大沽　三二九·五〇〇人</p>
<p>東九省　約二百萬人</p>
<p>廣州　一一〇·六八四人</p>
<p>廣州灣（西營）　三·六五〇人</p>
<p>汕頭六·四〇〇入</p>
<p>厦門一〇·七〇〇人</p>
<p>上海　七五九·二五〇人</p>
<p>按照美軍的原來意旨，海運方面，擬調用登陸船八十艘，作爲遣送日俘返國之用，預計卅六年一月底，可以全部運送完畢，後來經過多次會商，決定增加至八十五艘，並添用自由輪一艘，加以在美方控制下之日本船，預定本年六月底遣送完竣。</p>
<p>內運方，以長江水　，船舶缺乏，一部份鐡　，又迭被共軍破壞，水陸交通滯阻，輸遝日俘工作，遂不能完全與海運銜接配合，因此超逾了原定的期限。不過大致說來，工作尙不十分遲緩。據美軍部於本年七月上旬宣佈；最後一批撤退之日僑乘船離滬後，華中區將無日個踪跡·此最後一批撤退之日僑，共一千三百五十人，連同前撤退之日　，已達八十萬人。在華北各省，日人五十五萬業已撤退，所剩留者僅極少數。至於華南台灣及越北方而之日僑俘撤退工作，大部亦吿完成。</p>
<p>東北方面，政府區內的日僑俘，已經撤退。關於共軍控制區內的日人，經美方與中共洽商結果，兩方先訂一協定，最後由美方轉致由央建議書一份·八月十七日，政府代表李修檢，中共代表李敏然及軍調部美方代表貝爾上校，簽訂遣送東北日僑協議，即日生效，協議中決定：除旅順·大連·新義村以外的日僑，自八月二十日起，經松花江·拉法·杜溪三地，前來國軍防區，轉往葫蘆島歸國。同時，據由蘇聯歸抵福岡的日僑外山二郎談稱：渠原屬間島守備隊汽車隊，去年十月上旬，被送往蘇領波塞茨特，復被送往西伯利亞北部之索莫爾斯克，從車勞動，渠所屬部隊的一萬人，其他十處收容所，的有關東軍八萬至十萬人。由此可見東北日僑俘一部份已被運至西伯利亞爲蘇聯服務。</p>
<p>關於徵用日僑俘中之技術人員，爲我國政府服務一節，因降書上並無明文規定，留華服役的日人，眼前尙有二萬七千八百九十二人，服務期限，將延長至今年底爲止不再繼　續。</p>
<p>日僑俘的遣歸，爲了人數衆多，不得不分批舉行，由上海出口，最後的一批歸國日俘，是在本年七月中旬；而華北的末批日人，却在八月十日晨，方扌在塘沽登船回國。大抵最先遣送的爲：（一）獨身男女不能生活者，（二）不良份子，（三）有正當理由申請提早回國而經核准者。其餘分別留居在「日本徒手官兵集中營」和「日僑管理處」，陸續候輪返日。單以京滬區　言，這　集中營已有江灣，吳淞，南京，蘇州等十九處之多。</p>
<p>集中營裏的日俘，起寢作息，飲食娛樂，都有規定時間。日俘的「主食」，待遇一如我國軍人，另有「副食」和　費發給。日僑則按照各地生活程度，酌給生活費。起居有節，生活安定，雖然名爲俘虜，沒有一個是面黃肌瘦的。</p>
<p>依照遣送計劃，日僑俘在歸返本土之時，除各項應行遵守之規則外，每人隨身携帶的物品，行李以能一次自行携帶爲限，所藏現款，僑民不得超過日金千元，軍官，士卒，不得超過五百及二百日元。記者曾目睹一隊候輪返國，日僑俘的行列，每個人臉上　　愁容，肩負着力不能勝的行囊，甚至有跌倒路旁的狼狽情形。十年以來的「天之驕子」，一旦降爲從喪家之犬」，不知他們心中是羞憤，還是懺悔？</p>
<p>這些日人，十多年來，在我國橫行無忌，殘殺及魚肉成千成萬良善無辜的同胞，血債深仇，還末償雪，中國人的寬大，使這些「罪不容硃」的劊子手，還可以從容悠靜地，携帶着整齊的行裝返鄕。</p>
<p>每一個從中國歸去的日本人民，應該，永遠記取！這一種民族問的寬容，在中外古今的歷史上，尙無前例。</p>

<h3>日本侵華六十年　八載長期堅苦抗戰　奇恥大辱一朝洗雪</h3>
<p>— 本報特輯</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以每後，即蓄意向海外求發展，侵略中國，祗是整個政策的一端，這可以從日本歷史學家大監　雄所著「最新世界殖民史」中，「日本殖民史」一章，得到說明。他說：「如果將英·法·荷蘭·西班牙·葡萄牙諸先進國看為十九世紀以前的殖民國，則日本正是二十世紀以後的殖民國。日本領有海外殖民地，始自中日戰後佔據臺灣，所以日本的殖民史，僅有三十年的史蹟，因此，其殖民的才能，也尚不免幼稚。但是，日本在以後的十餘年間，每年都有殖民地的增加，經營方法，也漸改善，在世界上，遂成為一個殖民的強國，與列強為伍了。」幾句簡單的自述，不啻暴露了侵略者的猙獰面目，且以日本躍居「殖民強國」而欣欣自喜，可見其野心之大。</p>
<p>中·日正式樹立外交關係，是在遜清同治九年——日本明治三年，日本派柳原前光來華，遞呈國書，當時我國正被西文列強迫簽不平等通商條約，柳原此行，顯係探聽虛實，並打算援例訂約，未獲結果。次年五月，改派大藏卿伊達宗城為正使，柳原前光為副，和李鴻章治訂修好條約十八款，通商章程三十三款，並附中日海關規則，因為不盡與西方各國所訂條約相同，未能滿意，屢次請求修改。</p>
<p>併吞琉球之經過</p>
<p>琉球帬島與臺灣，前者為我國藩屬，後者為我國令土，日本在明治維新以後，對於近在咫尺的琉球，久存兼併之心，同治十年十一月，琉球漁民遇颶風流至臺灣，被生番所殺。次年二月，日本小田縣民四人，亦在臺灣遇害，日本遂派外長副島來華質問。當時總理衙門答以生番係化外之民，日本因藉詞侵犯臺灣，經英使威妥瑪居間調停，於同治十三年九月二十二日訂立條約，臺灣雖得保存，琉球事實上已渝為日本所有，光緒五年，日本將琉球改為沖繩縣。</p>
<p>朝鮮與甲午之戰</p>
<p>朝鮮亦為藩邦，與我國關係最深。日本屢次遣使前往活動，均無結果。光緒元年，日艦雲陽號，駛入朝鮮海岸，從事測量，發生衝突，是為江華事變，結果與朝鮮訂立江華條約，約中認朝鮮為自主之邦，以謀再作進一步之獨佔。其後朝鮮國王李熙的本生父大阮君，因不滿王后憫氏專政，夜襲王宮，縱火焚日本使館，是為壬午之亂。日本馳兵救援，又訂閱濟物浦條約，日本昨駐兵朝鮮。這時，朝鮮新舊兩黨對立，舊黨附中國，新黨親日本，新舊互攻，造成甲申之亂。日本遣派宮內使伊藤博文來中國，與李鴻章訂立天津條約，兩國各撤朝鮮駐兵，將來有事時，兩方出兵，須先行文知照。光緒二十年，日人在韓鼓勵東學黨作亂，韓王乞師中國，中日兩國齊向朝鮮出兵，亂平，日本內閣力主干預朝鮮內政，我方反對，因此演成中日甲午之戰，我軍水陸均收，光緒二十一年四月十七日，簽訂馬關條約，認朝鮮為完全獨立自主國，割讓遠東半島·臺灣·澎湖列島，並賠償軍費二萬萬兩。其後因俄·法·德三國出面干涉，遠東半島得以收還，臺灣雖被割讓，但當地人民，成立組織，抵抗日軍登陸，歷時半載之久。</p>
<p>日本與八國聯軍</p>
<p>光緒二十六年拳匪之亂，日本藉口書記官杉山彬為董福祥部兵所殺，派兵佔領廈門。並與英法等國軍隊會師入平津兩地，是為「八國聯軍」。次年九月八日，辛丑條約簽字，我國派使赴日謝罪，賠款總額四萬萬五千萬兩中，日本分得三千四百餘萬兩。</p>
<p>日俄之戰約的影響</p>
<p>俄國以干涉還遼，結怨日本，且兩國當時俱有意於我國東北，庚子之役，俄兵強佔滿洲不退，雙方利益衝突，光緒三十年二月八日深夜，日軍進攻旅順俄艦，兩國宣戰，日勝俄敗，俄國除割庫頁島南半嶼日本外，和約中並議定將俄國在滿洲權益移讓日本，我國無法抗拒，遂在光緒三十一年訂立中日滿洲善後條約，除承認俄國在滿洲權益全部讓與日本外，增開商埠多處，安奉鐵路準由日政府繼續經營，營口·安東各埠，劃定日本租界，日本更向中國要求十七條，中有「中國不得建築南滿鐵路並行線」等，經我拒絕，日本竟列入會議紀錄，後來狡賴為秘密議定書。</p>
<p>至於朝鮮，在宣統二年，統監寺內先奪取其警察權，代以日本憲兵，將國王遷至東京，另設朝鮮總督府治理，韓國遂亡。</p>
<p>對袁世凱之要挾</p>
<p>中華民國二年四月八日，我國正式國會成立，各國先後承認，日本竟以滿鮮減稅，及建築滿蒙鐵路五線為交換條件，袁氏於正式選舉總統之前，予以承認。日人一遇有機可乘，不惜以種種手段要挾威逼，其卑鄙無恥，於此可見。</p>
<p>「二十一條」要求</p>
<p>民國三年，第一次歐戰爆發，日本多方阻止中國參戰，自己則加入協約國，八月二十三日，以對德宣戰為名，出兵佔領青島及膠濟鐵路，目的不僅在承受德國在山東權利，且欲佔據魯省全境。民國四年一月七日，袁政府要求日本撤兵，日本反於同月十八日，由公使日置益逕向袁氏提出二十一條無理要求，其中分為五號：（一）繼承並擴大德國在山東特權；（二）擴張南滿及內蒙之軍事政治經濟特權及「土地所有權」（後改商租權）；（三）漢冶萍事業由日本獨佔；（四）中國沿海島嶼不得租予他國；（五）全國性的聘請日人為軍事·政治·財政顧問，中日警察合辦，接連武昌·九江·南昌·杭州·潮洲鐵路及福建路礦，由日建築等。日本意欲鯨吞我國之野心，至此暴露無遺。</p>
<p>日本向中國提出「二十一條」，恐遭各國干涉，警告我國嚴守秘密，一方面又向袁氏施行誘惑，延至五月七日，日本提出最後通牒，限袁氏在四十八小時內答覆，袁氏無奈，卒於五月九日訂立「山東條約」及「滿蒙條約」，除其中第四號以命令發表，第五號中的合辦警察一節，日本自動撤回外，其他則以照會同意。此即全國切齒痛心的「五九」國恥。</p>
<p>製造中國之內亂</p>
<p>袁氏死後，我國政治勢力形成南北兩派，日人乘機對北方政客施以籠絡誘逼，致造成民國六年，我國南北分裂的局面，相爭二年，禍延八省。當時日本寺內內閣執政，以金錢接濟北方軍閥，目的在延長中國內亂，總計民國六，七年間，日本借予北方軍閥的款項，幾達五萬萬元，多由日浪人西原經手，即所謂「西原借款」，軍閥得以從事長期內戰，即賴於此。民國七年，歐戰終了，雙方宣佈停戰，八年二月，在上海議和。但因日人幕後操縱，未得結果。</p>
<p>日人用心狡惡，又在民國七年九月，誘致北方政府成立「中日陸海共同防敵軍事協定」，八年二月五日，續訂所謂「中日軍事協定延長條約」，此外尚有未經發表的其他秘密協定，目的在製造中國的長期內爭，損蝕我國力，以逐漸實現其蠶食鯨吞的侵略政策。</p>
<p>巴黎和會的激動</p>
<p>民國七年，歐戰結束，民國八年一月，協約國在巴黎召開和平會議，我國係參戰國之一，故得派員出席，當時以為「巴黎和會」為國際關係轉變的最大關鍵，中國朝野上下，對和會期望至深，欲一舉掃除一切不平等的束縛。不料日本事先已和各國訂有密約，我代表提出收回青島及德國在山東特殊權益的要求，日本代表堅決反對，竟主張和會在對德和約條文內，明白規定將德國在山東之一切權利，無條件移交日本，同時向北京政府抗議，干涉我國代表在和會發言。於是凡爾賽和約上，卒列入將德國在山東權益讓予日本的一條，我代表聲請保留，竟被拒絕。消息傳至我國，激起民眾廣大憤慨，造成北平學生界所發動的「五四運動」。</p>
<p>華府會議的原則</p>
<p>民國十年七月，美國發起召開太平洋國際會議，十一月在華盛頓開會，參加者共有英，美，中，法，日，義，荷，比，葡九國，會中討論的主題，一為限制軍備，一為遠東問題——亦即中日兩國間的懸案，美國代表路特提出四項原則，作為解決中國問題的基礎，經大會通過，四項原則是：（一）尊重中國之主權與獨立及領土與行政之完整；（二）給予中國完全無礙之機會，以發展並維持一有力鞏固之政府；（三）設立並維持各國在中國之商務實業機會均等之原則；（四）不得乘中國現狀，當謀特別權利而減少友邦人民之權利，並不得獎許有礙友邦安全之舉動。</p>
<p>會議結果，關於我國關稅自主和取消勢力範圍兩點，日本俱表反對，前者另擬折衷辦法，後者竟歸擱置。</p>
<p>我國代表在會中曾提出對日本的提案兩件，即為：交還山東權益及廢除二十一條中日協約，日本代表起初拒絕討論，後因美國及國際壓力，不得不稍作讓步，德國在山東之產業，在六個月內歸還我國，日本在魯省軍警亦限期撤退。總之，「華盛頓會議」雖未能盡如我國所望，但對於野心勃勃的日本，卻無異當頭一棒。</p>
<p>五卅慘案的發生</p>
<p>日人在我國上海一地，設有紗廠甚多，而對雇用的華工，待遇非常苛刻，不平之事，常有所聞。民國十四年五月，工人推舉代表向日籍廠主請願，要求改善待遇，日廠長突開槍擊斃工人顧正紅，並擊傷其餘代表多人。受傷工人反遭公共租界工部局拘禁，於是激起學生公憤，在五月三十日發起公祭顧正紅，並在公共租界作示威演說，西捕干涉，逮捕演講者，帬眾尾隨到捕房門前，西警忽向群眾開槍，死傷甚多，演成大慘劇，追尋根源，日人實為禍首。</p>
<p>濟南慘案的演成</p>
<p>民國十七年，我國民革命軍在北伐順利進展，擊敗直魯軍，在四月底佔領濟南。五月一日二日，中央各機關先後到達，三日午前，因一日人與一中國兵發生爭執，大隊日兵忽向中國兵營　擊，於是濟南日軍全數出動，猛攻我革命軍，結果全城盡為佔領。我軍民遭慘殺死傷甚多，以特派山東交涉員蔡公時死狀為最慘，日人橫蠻成性，虐殺外交官，竟視國際公法為無物矣。</p>
<p>日軍當時造成「濟南慘案」之主要原因，係在阻礙國民革命之統一，仍欲保持北方軍閥餘孽，造成中國分崩離析的局面，以使從中宰割。但我革命軍忍辱負重，改道行軍，繼續北伐。</p>
<p>「九一八事件」後</p>
<p>民國二十年九月十八日，日軍突以大軍進攻瀋陽，二十日進迫吉林，北指黑龍江，南掠錦州，僅於十一月間在嫩江橋遭馬占山率部抵抗，十二月終，盡佔三省要地。</p>
<p>東北旣陷，我政府向「國聯」呼籲，日本則主張直接交涉，「國聯」兩次勸告日本撤兵無結果，十二月十日，「國聯」成立調查團，以英國李頓為首。二十一年一月二十八日，駐滬日軍乘夜向我十九路軍攻擊，十九路軍及第五軍奮勇迎戰，斬獲頗多，日軍三次增援，直至三月一日，始在瀏河登陸，我軍退守南翔，但我軍之英勇民氣之激昂，在國際上已獲得更高評價。</p>
<p>三月初，日人土肥原將　儀誘挾至長春，成立「滿洲國」，此時，李頓調查團方抵達我國，隨即北上調查。五月五日，以英法美三國出面調停，成立「上海停戰協定」，其中一項載明「華軍留駐於現在地點」。九月底，李頓報告書送達國聯，十月二日公佈，認日本軍事行動為無理，建議成立「特殊組織」治理東北，以代日本武力造成之「滿洲國」。民國二十二年二月，國聯大會宣布決議：日本撤兵，樹立東三省自治制，並由大會組織一委員會，襄助中日兩國，解決懸案。日本竟悍然拂袖，同年三月，宣告退出「國聯」，不受約束。</p>
<p>「國聯」無計對付，日軍向關內進兵，榆關方失，承德又陷，五月二十一日，通州陷落，平津危急，我政府以外援絕望，決戰尚非其時，遂於五月三十一日，訂立「塘沽協定」，對偽滿並無規定，惟冀東各地則名存實亡，日本已獲得進攻河北之根據地</p>
<p>全面抗戰的展開</p>
<p>民國二十五年，日本對我的侵略工作，絲毫不懈，除了軍事方面，繼續向綏遠進攻以外，經濟方面，實行華北武裝走私，一面資助特務活動，同時更發動外交攻勢，遺川越來華談判，是年一月，廣田宣布所謂「三原則」，要求五省自治，中日通航，改正稅率，聘用日顧問等，無異將我國行政及經濟商業歸其支配，談判毫無結果。同年夏，發生兩廣事件，十二月西安事變發生，結果反促成中國政治上之統一，中國經濟亦賴施行法幣政策而趨穩定。二十六年，兒玉率經濟調查團來華進行合作，介于我所成。華北經濟合作，亦未獲解決。同時日本因謀我心切，特殊活動亦多敗露，七月一日，漢奸圖在平津暴動被捕，於是日本老羞成怒，七月七日，在蘆溝橋發動挑戰，八月十三日更派兵在上海尋釁，全面抗戰，於是展開，歷時八載，賴與我盟邦的緊密合作，全國軍民的意志堅定，終於使日本屈膝乞降，獲得最後勝利，洗雪了六十年來的奇恥大辱。</p>

<p>八月十六日，上午七時半，記者自由中國駐日代表團駐滬辦事處乘車出發，車行一小時半後，就到了空軍第八大隊根據地的大塲。這次一同赴日的人員，除了該團吳組長以外，還有團員四人。抵機塲後，每人都一一經過查詢，於九時三十分登機塲起飛，由正駕駛邢厭厞少校及副駕駛員馮汝　駕駛，還有領航咒顧維正，和機械員高鵬飛，通訊員黃邦傑，也參加這次飛行。</p>
<p>在洋上飛行三小時以後，就看有見陸地，飛進了日本國境，飛過了福岡，領航員顧維正君，為了要使我們能憑弔一下原子彈在廣易所留下的戰跡，特地改變了航程，繞道飛行，在廣島上空盤旋了一週，天空上所見的廣島，眞可說是一片焦土，地面呈焦黃色。</p>
<p>飛機過富士山後在四時左右，到了東京附近神奈川縣厚木機塲，這機塲完全出乎我的意料以外，遠不及在抗戰期間所修建的印度阿薩姆省察坡機塲來得整潔和宏大。地面都是以鋼板舖成。據同行的空軍人員吿我，這種建築方式，一種軍事佔領時期的臨時建築。降落後，代表團派來了錢少校照料，但是還須與美軍人員辦理入境手續，例如打防疫針及種痘照相等。直等到五時左右，才乘軍用汽車駛出飛機塲，開始接觸了日本農村的風光。</p>
<p>在飛機塲附近，看不出絲毫的戰爭遺跡，等我們的汽車開進了橫濱市，才領略到戰爭給日人所留下的傷痕。橫濱在戰前本是東京的門戶，與外國通商的港口，而現在的橫濱大街上，除了殘破的瓦礫和臨時以木板搭成的簡陋住屋以外，幾無一座高樓大厦，更看不見大的商店，川崎工作區已蕩然無存了。</p>
<p>車過多摩川橋，進入東京都時，才看見若干戰前遺留下來的房屋，可是東京都內的街道，與十年前完全改觀，凹凸不等，污穢不堪。每處對於我都非常陌生，我幾乎忘記我是在東京都內馳驅。等我們的汽車開進了麻布區廣尾町的中國代表團以後，我才知道這就是戰後的東京，我才領略到戰爭給與日本人的變化之大。</p>
<p>（一）銀座的夜店</p>
<p>銀座在戰前，本是像上海的南京路一樣，是最熱鬧最繁華的街道。戰前除了各種正式店舖之外，而且每晚有各色各樣的商人，沿着馬路成行的擺起攤子來，出售各種物品。可是戰後的銀座，非常蕭條，幾家大的百貨店如松坂屋，三越等都已炸燬了。現今碩僅存的大厦，只有服部時計店（鐘錶店）可是巳改成了美軍消費合作社。沿街過去，西洋式的建築　，都已蕩然無存，代之而起的，是以木板搭成的矮小商店。好像「五四」轟炸過後的重慶都郵街，在日間再加之沿馬路的地攤商，這就是戰後的銀座日市</p>
<p>在這些地攤上，偶而也看見有美國的玻璃木梳出售，但不如上海黃牛黨市塲上的猖狂。這條街，一到晚上便寂靜無聲，行人寥寥，只有若干士兵追逐着神女和MP吉普車的巡羅。比較整潔的地方，只有「丸之內」和皇宮前面，幾無一帶是屬於盟軍的勢力範圍以內。設備完善，建築堅固的高樓大厦，都被盟軍徵用了。</p>
<p>現在在日本橋方面，還留下有三個大規模的百貨商店—高島屋，白木屋和三越，在繼續營業。但，遠不及上海的先施永安陳設得富慶堂皇。更找不出一點舶來品。出售的物品，多粗製濫造，看不出戰前日人所具有的特色—小巧精緻。可是價格比戰前高出了十二倍，而黑市的價格則在千倍以上。一雙皮鞋的黑市價格，在八百元左右，合美金五六十元。</p>
<p>（三）也鬧房屋荒</p>
<p>因受戰時空襲的破壞，並戰後大批盟軍（日人稱為進駐軍）入境的結果，房荒十分嚴重，也有類似上海以頂費頂屋的情形。在各報上，都能看見登有願出頂費（日人叫做權利金）徵屋的小廣吿。據估計日本現缺乏屋四百二十萬棟，再加之每年因風雨水災所毀壞的房屋，每年約二十萬棟。如每年建築六十萬棟，需時十年，始可建成。可是現在政府的計劃，每年只可建築二十萬棟，結果僅可彌補房屋的自然損害率而已。而且日本木材缺乏，須由國外輸入，但是目前實無希望自國外輸入木材。</p>
<p>（四）食糧的危機</p>
<p>在日人投降後，曾有人預料在這一年內，將有百萬人餓死，內閣雖曾三次更換，然對糧食問題，均感束手無策。六月裏，東京及橫濱兩地，曾有二十多天未配給食米，在五月十九日曾有羣箘二十萬人舉行「要求發米」示威遊行，手執紅旗，向首相官邸及皇宮方面進發。聯合軍方面有鑒於此，特輸入糧食，發與日人，計發放五次。第一次是在五月二十日，計發放五·二日份·第二次為六月十一日，計五·九日份，第三次在六月二十二日，計十三·四日份，第四次為七月二日，計十日份，第五回為七月十三日，計麵粉七·五日份和罐頭六·二日份。自第一次之五月二十日起，迄第五次之七月二十七日止，為時六十九日，計有百分之七十的糧食，係由聯合軍方面所發放。八月間聯合軍方面尙輸入大量食米，發與日人。今年米的收穫額，據估計在五千五百萬石，較去年之實收額三千九百萬石，多出一千六百萬石。這是因為今年日人特別受惠於天時順調所致，但是肥料仍感不足，所以目前日人眞是靠天吃飯了。</p>
<p>（五）新圓的泛濫</p>
<p>日政府在投降後，為了抑制圓的膨脹，於二月間公怖了「金融緊急措置令」，由日本銀行發行了一種新鈔名為新「圓」，令日人將舊「圓」與新「圓」掉換。可是這種措置，未見奏效。在五月初新圓的發行，突破了三百億，至八月一日則已突破五百億圓了。如果此種情形，再繼續下去的話，到今年年底，將要與中國和匈牙利通貨膨脹的情形如去不遠了。</p>
<p>（六）失來極嚴重</p>
<p>在日本投降後，一切產業上的活動，均吿停頓，勞働力自然無法消化。在經濟原則上講，產業的再建，依存於勞働力的方面很多，但是目前日本的情形反是勞働力的消化，依存於產業的復興。據河合厚相談稱：一般失業者計二百五十萬人，如再加上黑市商人，和其他潛在的失業者，以及從國外遣歸的日人，失業總數將達五百萬人，在今年下半期，日政府停止對軍需有關的工業貼補後，各產業須從事整理，並在賠款問題解決後，有若干業設備，須由日本撤定，故將有十萬人要變成為產業後備軍—失業者。這幾天國營鐵道工人因裁員問題，正在醖釀着，可見失業問題嚴重之一般。</p>

<h3>Dispatch of Envoy Wu and Zhang to Return to the Capital; Five-Person Group to Begin Talks Tomorrow; Agenda Limited to the Number of Seats for the Communist Party in the Government Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Ambassador Stuart flew from Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the 2nd, arriving in Beijing and immediately going to the embassy to rest. He only went out once in the afternoon and had no political activities. The Ambassador originally hoped to meet with Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, who were returning to Beijing from Guling, for an informal pre-opening meeting of the group, but since Wu and Zhang only arrived in Beijing in the afternoon, he rescheduled the meeting for 10:00 AM on the 3rd at the embassy to exchange views. Furthermore, Zhou Enlai called the Ambassador from Shanghai on the night of the 1st, intending to return to Beijing by special plane, and called again on the morning of the 2nd to say that he would postpone the trip due to business, but he would definitely arrive in Beijing on the morning of the 3rd. The Ambassador has scheduled a meeting with Zhou for 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the formal talks are scheduled to begin at the embassy on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Minister Zhang Lisheng, and Vice Minister Hong Lanyou returned to Beijing from Guling together at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The reporter visited Mr. Wu at his private residence in the evening. Mr. Wu was sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool air, holding a palm-leaf fan. His tone was calm when talking to the reporter, reflecting his attitude toward the current situation. It is reported that his trip to Guling with Minister Zhang was to consult with the Chairman regarding the informal group meeting, and they hope that this meeting can be convened as soon as possible. It has now been decided to meet with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 3rd to exchange views before the meeting. Secondly, we are deeply moved by the mediation efforts of Mr. Marshall and Mr. Stuart in the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Finally, he stated that the theme of this meeting should be the reorganization of the National Government Committee, as it is the key to all problems. If a good agreement can be reached on this theme, other problems can be easily solved. Because the Kuomintang is currently the ruling party and other parties are in the opposition, if the reorganization of the National Government Committee is completed, all parties will be in the government, and everyone can handle all issues as masters. When the reporter asked his views on this meeting, Mr. Wu said: We have great confidence that an agreement will be reached, and we believe that this meeting will have good results. When the reporter further inquired about the Communist Party's external rhetoric, emphasizing that if there is no guarantee of an immediate ceasefire after the reorganization of the National Government, and the government does not withdraw the five demands, then this meeting will be in vain, what is his opinion? Mr. Wu said: I sincerely hope that they will not insist on it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The reporter visited Minister Zhang Lisheng on the evening of the 2nd. According to him, the Chairman summoned him three times in Guling. The Chairman's instructions for the informal group meeting were that some issues have already been decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and only the implementation is in question. The number of seats in the National Government Committee has also been decided, that is, the Kuomintang will occupy half of the forty seats in the Government Committee, and the current discussion is only about the distribution of the remaining seats to other parties. This meeting will take this as the only topic, and he hopes that everyone will think more about the future of the country and the nation, so that peace and independence can be realized. If other issues are raised, it will be beyond the original agenda, and he sincerely hopes that not too much will be involved. At the same time, he expressed that he did not want to express any opinions before the formal opening of this meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: The five-person group was established specifically to discuss the issue of reorganizing the National Government Committee, so the scope of the agenda is limited to the issue of the number of seats for discussing communist parties to participate in the government committee, and does not involve other issues. Mr. Wu continued: Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the reorganization of the National Government Committee has not been realized because an agreement has not been reached on the issue of the number of seats for various parties to participate in the government, and the list has not been submitted. At the same time, the list of National Assembly representatives of various parties has not been submitted, resulting in the postponement of the National Assembly. Therefore, based on past experience, the discussion of the five-person group regarding the distribution of the National Government list in the future will inevitably involve disputes and difficulties. However, recently, all parties seem to have a realization that if the reorganization of the National Government had already been realized, and representatives of various parties had participated in the government and were responsible for solving various problems, then the situation in China might be better than it is today. Currently, all parties have expressed that they do not object to conducting negotiations on reorganizing the government. If everyone meets with sincerity, even if there are some difficulties, it is hoped that a solution can be reached.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation: Zhou Enlai is not optimistic about the informal group meeting. He also said that the two prerequisite opinions must be resolved before the meeting, otherwise, we will not be able to discuss any other issues.</p>
<h3>Marshal Ma to Leave Guling for Beijing Today; The Chairman Gave a Special Farewell Banquet at the Headquarters Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 2nd] Special Envoy Marshall is scheduled to return to Beijing on the 3rd, and Mrs. Marshall still plans to stay in Guling for ten days. It is generally predicted that after Marshal Ma's seventh visit to Lushan, he will return to Nanjing with his wife. It is also heard that Marshal Ma is still planning to travel to Shanghai and Hangzhou with his wife when the autumn weather is clear and crisp.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 2nd] Madame Chiang visited Marshal Ma and his wife this afternoon and had lunch with them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] Marshal Ma and Consultant Pound and their wives are scheduled to leave Guling for Beijing on the morning of the 3rd. On the evening of the 2nd, Chairman Chiang and his wife gave a special farewell banquet for Marshal Ma and others at the headquarters and invited Marshal Ma's wife, Minister Xie Guansheng, and Director Yang Zhaolong to accompany them. Marshal Ma and others did not leave until 9:30 PM.</p>
<h3>And Accepts Portrait of Fu Tingyan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 2nd] At 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, Marshal Ma met with Wu Shih-han, the director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, and inquired in detail about the situation in Lushan. Marshal Ma also believed that the roads in Lushan are among the cleanest roads in China. Wu Shih-han also presented Marshal Ma with a portrait painted by the famous artist Fu Tingyan as a token of respect to this honored guest, in commemoration of his contributions in Lushan. Marshal Ma accepted it with a smile and considered this portrait to be the most satisfactory work among his life portraits.</p>
<h3>"Flying Hotel"</h3>

<h3>People's Opinion Organizations in Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties</h3>
<p>Expected to be Established Before the National Assembly Convenes</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Minister Zhang Lisheng talked about the completion of the people's opinion organizations before the convening of the National Assembly on the evening of the 2nd, briefly stating that the Chairman expressed great concern about this in Guling, and inquired in detail about the people's opinion organizations in various provinces, cities, and counties and their connection with the provincial and county governments at all levels. According to the Chairman's intention at the beginning of the year, the people's opinion organizations in various provinces and counties were to be completed before May 5th of this year. However, the fact was that it could not be achieved as scheduled. Now, efforts are being made to expect that all regions except Hebei and Shandong, where there are slight difficulties, will be officially established before the National Assembly convenes.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to people from Subei, the Central Extraordinary Committee of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Published an Announcement to Comrades Regarding the Subei War, Firmly Advocating Peace and Striving for the Support of the People Throughout the Country Through Peaceful and Legal Struggle; Calling for Opposition to Mao Zedong's Armed Line and Overthrow of "Mao-ism."</p>
<p>The Central Extraordinary Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward nine specific proposals for the current Subei issue: (1) Take practical actions to oppose war and demand peace.

(3) Dispatch representatives to contact the authorities, stop the conflict, implement reorganization, and complete the nationalization of the army as soon as possible. (4) Use Subei as a buffer zone, with neither side stationing troops; its political organization should be unified under the central government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. (5) Demand that the Kuomintang guarantee the safety of Communist Party members who lay down their arms. (6) Oppose retaliatory measures against Communist Party members and the people of Subei who advocate peace. (7) Resolutely provide relief to refugees and affected Communist Party members.

<h3>Envoy Urges American Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Coming to China Should Not Be for Getting Rich; Should Develop a Spirit of Cooperation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] American overseas Chinese were very interested in Ambassador Stuart's remarks during his two days in Shanghai. The Ambassador told several overseas Chinese leaders that we should not come to China for the purpose of getting rich, but should focus on the spirit of cooperation. China will also provide convenience to cooperate with the development of this spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<h3>Baker Discusses the Current Situation in China; Closely Resembles the American Civil War; Recognizes the CCP as a Land Reform Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] San Francisco News: Baker, who has long been engaged in relief work in China, recently told the San Francisco Public Welfare Society that the current situation in China closely resembles the American Civil War, and the various problems facing Chairman Chiang are almost the same as those encountered by Lincoln at the time. Baker said at a luncheon meeting of Pacific Coast business leaders that Lincoln's attitude towards military rebellion was almost the same as Chairman Chiang's. Lincoln also lacked unanimous support at the time, and the only condition for peace was unification. If this condition was rejected, his troops would advance to the rebellious states, and he was accused of starting a war. Chairman Chiang has insisted on establishing a national army. If there are two independent armies in one country at the same time, then it cannot be called a unified country. Those who protected the slave system in the United States during Lincoln's era were noisy for a while, and now those who protect the CCP in the United States are also very noisy. They praise the virtues of the Communist Party and condemn the sins of the Kuomintang. Baker finally pointed out that although Mao Zedong claims that the CCP is a real communist party, the CCP is still a land reform party.</p>
<h3>Threat to the Outskirts of Xuzhou Lifted; National Army Recaptures Taierzhuang; Situation in Jingtai, Subei Becomes Tense</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, the National Army entered Taierzhuang and immediately deployed city defense and security matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] Military sources: To lift the threat of the Communist Army on the outskirts of Xuzhou, the National Army welcomed and severely attacked the Communist Army that had fled south from the Yixian Zaozhuang Taierzhuang area. Part of the National Army recaptured Taierzhuang at 8:00 AM today. The famous town that won the greatest victory during the War of Resistance Against Japan has now been visited by the National Army again. The general public welcomes it warmly.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 2nd] The situation in Jingtai is becoming tense. A certain field hospital was also attacked, so wounded soldiers are crossing the river to the south. All sectors of Cheng are scheduled to visit and comfort them on the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist Army in the western countryside of Jingjiang has been actively mobilizing militias for days. Each township is based on those who have been allocated farmland. Even those over fifty years old must also take on the job of sentry. The slogan is to concentrate forces to attack the two counties of Jingtai and blockade all ports. All ships traveling south to north have been detained and concentrated at Siwei Port, with the intention of disrupting the Jiangnan area. Naval ships in the river are on high alert.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to official sources: (1) The Communist Army is actively strengthening the city defense of Gaoyou with a force of one regiment, 1,500 to 1,600 people, and building a bunker every eight or ten feet on the city wall, covering the top with soil to avoid targets. Deep cellars are also dug under the bunkers, with bamboo ladders going up and down, and communication trenches connecting each other, in order to defend stubbornly. (2) The Communist Army entrenched in the Gaobao area posted a notice on September 1st, stating that all men between the ages of sixteen and forty-five are included in the conscripted militia. Those who evade will have their families harmed.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Leaders Meeting in Harbin</h3>
<p>Rumors that Mao Zedong Attended</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 1st] People from Harbin said that the Harbin press said that Mao Zedong had gone to Harbin to attend an important meeting. This meeting was held recently, and Lin Biao, Zhong Ziyun, and others attended. However, the nature of the meeting was absolutely secret. At the same time, the Communist Army in Harbin advocated improving the lives of Muslims. Muslim businesses are exempt from taxes, and all Muslim youths are encouraged to join the army, and special training is provided for Muslim work and espionage teams.</p>
<h3>CCP Propaganda Offensive; Unreasonably Accuses the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The CCP's propaganda offensive today not only regards the government's unreasonable demands as the main obstacle to solving the problem, but also accuses the United States without reservation, citing two main reasons: (1) the stationing of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, and (2) the U.S. continued assistance to government troops and air force. According to the CCP spokesman of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, without U.S. aid, the government army would not be stronger than the CCP army.</p>
<h3>CCP's Xi'an Office; Zhu De Orders Withdrawal to Yan'an</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Xinhua News Agency: Zhu De has telegraphed the Xi'an Office of the Eighteenth Group Army to withdraw to Yan'an in full on the 10th, and announced that the troops of Li Xiannian and Wang Zhen have broken through and withdrawn to the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.</p>
<h3>National Army in Rehe Approaches Weichang; One Route Reaches the Suburbs of Chifeng; All Outposts Outside Datong City are Captured by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] It has been learned here that after the National Army recovered Chengde, those who went north approached Weichang, those who went south entered Luanping, and the National Army advancing towards Chifeng has reached the suburbs. According to transportation sources, the railway authorities here have been urging the relevant parties to quickly prepare materials and manpower to repair the Beiping-Chengde line. The first batch of people will go to Miyun tomorrow to await orders, and the second and third batches will continue to go. Construction can begin in mid-month. At the same time, Chengde is also preparing to proceed from both sides by the Jinzhou Railway Bureau. If the National Army can open up the Pingcheng Qian in the near future, the Communist Army in eastern Hebei will fall into a large encirclement. On the other hand, because the Beining Line has been repeatedly damaged and attacked by the Communist Army recently, it is heard that the National Army has countermeasures, first to clear the Guan Nei section of the Beining Road.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Dispatch, 2nd] It is heard that after Chengde was recovered, Zhou Enlai sent a telegram similar to a memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall, but did not mention a word about the Communist Army's siege of Datong.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] Relevant parties received a report today that all the outposts east, west, south, and west of Datong City have been completely captured by the Communist Army. Currently, only the train station site north of the city is still being defended by the Northeast Advance Army of Ma Zhanshan's department. Jialing Zhoujiacun in the southeast of the city and Majunying in the east of the city have been lost. The Fulu Police Academy in the east of the city was also lost yesterday. Currently, Chu Xichun's department has completely retreated to the city. Although there is no report of the loss of the airfield in the southeast of the city, since there are no defenders in the southeast of the city, it should have been attacked by the Communist Army. The Communist Army is now concentrating its main force to attack the train station alcohol company and other strongholds in the north of the city. Commander Mu Xinya, commander of the Fifth Division, reported to Ma Zhanshan that he was feeling unable to support it. Ma Zhanshan asked Li, the director of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, to find a way to rescue him as soon as possible. Aircraft still deliver ammunition and food to the city every day, but the people's food is still a serious problem, so even if the defenders can hold the city walls for a considerable period of time, if the people's food cannot be solved, there is no guarantee that there will be no changes.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] By Baoding telephone, Chairman of Hebei Province Sun Lianzhong told reporters yesterday before returning to Ping from Bao that the current important task in Hebei Province is to consolidate and expand the security circle, and the party, government, and military will jointly carry out the work of cleaning up the countryside and suppressing bandits. It is also learned that the Communist Army in the Central Hebei Military Region is actively preparing for war and preparing a large number of tools for destroying railways. Its regular army and militia total about 60,000.</p>
<h3>People of Qufu Gather and Kill Communist Army Cadres</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] The people of Qufu could not bear the trampling and oppression of the Communist Army. On August 20th, they gathered more than 300 people and broke into the Communist Army district headquarters, killing more than 50 Communist Army cadres.</p>

<h3>Gansu's Five-Person Group Visits Chief Sun; Scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou Today to Inquire About Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The Gansu Five-Person Group visited Sun Lianzhong, the chief of the Eleventh War Zone, at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to solicit his opinions on resolving the Anping incident. Sun expressed that the occurrence of the Anping incident was unfortunate for Sino-US friendship, and he sincerely hoped that the group would complete its investigation work as soon as possible to seek a fair and reasonable solution. Sun then excused himself due to official business and instructed Deputy Chief of Staff Gao Songyuan and Huang Rencai, the commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region, to answer the group's inquiries on his behalf. Gao solemnly answered Colonel Martin's inquiry that the National Army did not participate in the July 29th incident, and the US military did not assist the National Army. During the inquiry on the 2nd, regarding whether Anping was a liberated area, Gao said: After the victory, Xianghe and Baodi in eastern Hebei were both areas of the National Army. After the January 13th truce order, the Communist Army captured Xianghe on August 8th. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Chief's Office requested the Executive Headquarters to mediate, but no results were obtained. After January 18th, Xianghe County was forced to withdraw west of the North Canal. Occasionally, the Communist Army would cross the canal to search for supplies to the west. In order to ensure the safety of the Pingjin Highway, the Chief's Office often sent troops to patrol, and US military vehicles often passed through. On June 2nd, the Xianghe Police Corps stationed in Anping Town was transferred to Shicao due to housing adjustment and training reasons. Gao finally said that not every place in the National Army's garrison area is constantly garrisoned, so it cannot be called a liberated area just because the National Army does not garrison troops. Huang Rencai, the commissioner of the Fifth Region, said that Xianghe was one of the counties received by the Fifth Region after the victory. On December 26th, Ban Zhangru, the magistrate of Xianghe County, arrived in the county town to take over the county administration from the puppet county magistrate. In January of this year, after half a month of war, the Communist Army captured Xianghe, and Ban Zhangru led the local team to withdraw to Anping.</p>

<h3>Xiong Shihui Receives Our Newspaper Reporter, Discusses Plans for the Future of the Northeast, Reception Work Should Not Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 2nd Dispatch] On the eve of the first anniversary of the September 3rd victory, our newspaper reporter interviewed Director Xiong of the Northeast Headquarters, inquiring about the grand plans for the future of the Northeast. Xiong stated: The fruits of the national revolutionary war of resistance are extremely precious, and all Chinese people must cherish them. If this can be done, the success of national construction is not the most difficult. Because some people have a weak national concept and implement deceptive tricks, causing the current chaotic situation, my personal opinion is that the media should strive to clarify right and wrong and correct perspectives. The reporter then asked Xiong about the fact that some provinces in the Northeast have not yet been received. Xiong said: The people of the Northeast have endured fourteen years of puppet rule. If the government understands the suffering of the people, it should seek a solution as soon as possible. If it cannot be received by peaceful means, then it should be received by military means. In short, it should not be delayed for a long time, leaving the people to suffer in deep water and fiery heat. Regarding diplomatic and political aspects, in the Northeast, except for Jinzhou, which was recovered at the end of last year, Jilin and Liaobei have been recovered for a shorter period, and Shenyang has only been recovered for half a year. During the military period, all facilities cannot be as expected, but the responsible personnel in all departments can review and improve them at any time.</p>

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Investigation Team Sends Letter to Tianjin Mayor, Offering Opinions on the Wang Xijun Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 1st Dispatch] Before leaving Tianjin, the Reception Work Investigation Team sent a letter to Mayor Zhang, offering opinions on the Wang Xijun case of the Public Utilities Bureau. The original letter stated: "We recently heard that Your Excellency, the Mayor, gave a speech to the employees of the Public Utilities Bureau regarding the Wang Qianjun corruption case, scolding the whistleblower as not being born of parents, and stating that there would be a thorough investigation, etc. The colleagues of this team deeply believe that this is not the case. In recent years, corruption has been rampant, and the reception process has been particularly lax. This is due to the corruption of officials and the abandonment of laws and regulations. However, the general public, turning a blind eye and failing to report, is also a major cause of the growth of corruption. After the victory, the Chairman visited and set up secret reporting mailboxes to encourage people to report corruption in order to correct the situation from top to bottom and eradicate corruption. The provisions of this team's investigation methods stipulate that receiving reports from the people is based on this principle. Moreover, this report has no ulterior motive, so all whistleblowers, unless they are making false accusations out of resentment, are good citizens who distinguish right from wrong and excellent civil servants who are unwilling to associate with the corrupt. The government agencies should maintain them to cultivate the integrity of the country. If they are discriminated against, it will not only violate the Chairman's intentions and hinder the investigation work, making it impossible for politics to be clear forever, but also involve suspicion of protecting corruption. Your Excellency, the Mayor, must share our views. We would like to know whether the speech given by Your Excellency to the employees of the Public Utilities Bureau is true, and we hope to receive a reply."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] The Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Area Reception Work Investigation Team worked in Tianjin for two weeks and returned to Beiping from Tianjin on the morning of the 1st.

<p>The arrogant Japanese militarists knelt on this day last year. Representing the Japanese militarists, who are now detained in Sugamo Prison and listed as war criminals, the former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, Yoshijiro Umezu, along with Mamoru Shigemitsu, the representative of the Japanese government, silently signed their names on the instrument of surrender on this American warship, under the gaze of Allied Supreme Commander General Douglas MacArthur and delegations from various Allied nations, and then quietly departed. This signature not only represented the belief that justice will inevitably triumph over tyranny, shattering the myth among the Japanese people that the Japanese army had never been conquered by foreign forces and that Japanese territory had never been invaded by foreign powers throughout their history. This signature also represented the decline of an empire and the beginning of a new era in human history. In the hearts of the Chinese people, the scene on the USS Missouri holds particularly profound significance. It was the complete settlement of Japan's aggression against China over the past fifty years, washing away the humiliation we had endured since 1895. Since then, Japan has been under Allied control, and a year has passed in the blink of an eye. Today, as we commemorate this significant day, and reflect on the evolution of the global situation over the past year, we cannot help but feel a multitude of emotions. We offer a few words to encourage mutual vigilance.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must express our respect and admiration for General MacArthur, who bears the practical responsibility for Allied control of Japan. This five-star general, the liberator of the Philippines, is not only an outstanding military leader but also a great statesman with a deep understanding of the situation in Japan. He is indeed the most suitable person to bear the practical responsibility for controlling Japan. Under General MacArthur's control over the past year, we have seen various signs that Japan is moving towards democratization. The holding of general elections, the dissolution of financial cliques, the improvement of feudal tenant relations, and the amendment of the constitution and other laws are all symbols of Japan's movement towards democratization. Although their progress may not have reached the ideal speed, and their scope may not be entirely as we would like, Japan is indeed changing, moving from the tyranny of militarist rule and feudalism towards democratization. These changes cannot be achieved in a short period. Given the depth of the Japanese people's poisoning, this kind of change requires a longer period to complete. General MacArthur's steady yet very proactive policies, which allow the Japanese people to have ample opportunities for re-education and enable Japan's democratization to have a solid foundation, are indeed very timely.</p>
<p>Looking at the world from Japan's perspective, the turmoil and instability of the past year cannot help but make people uneasy. In this turbulent world, the clash of ideologies is the primary cause of all the instability. Now that the Axis powers have been defeated, some countries still adhere to power politics, believing that world peace can only be maintained if the entire world adheres to the same ideology. Is this starting point really that different from the Japanese militarists' "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof"? On the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, General MacArthur's statement specifically pointed this out, and its significance is extremely profound. General MacArthur began by saying, "It has been a year since Japan signed the instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri, and now the world is shrouded in a shadow of fear and unease due to the erosion of harmful ideologies." He continued, "If we allow this kind of thinking to spread unchecked, then individual freedom will disappear without a trace. Those who have long been indoctrinated by the extreme right wing are often easily captured by extreme left-wing ideologies." And finally, he reminded us of Japan's future role in the world: will it become a bastion of peace, or will it turn into a springboard for war? This warning is truly worth pondering. The Japanese people have long been under the indoctrination of extreme right-wing ideologies, and the shift from extreme right to extreme left is as easy as turning one's hand. Whether General MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan will succeed, we must look at it from a long-term perspective and see if it can prevent the kind of change that he himself has observed.</p>
<p>Here, however, we must also point out that although many of the main figures of Japanese aggression are listed as war criminals and will soon receive their due punishment, the remnants of Japanese militarism can still spread and circulate among the Japanese people. The execution of militarist leaders does not necessarily mean the death of the Japanese military. Although the Japanese military has been formally dissolved in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, the young officers who formed the backbone of the Japanese military still exist among the Japanese people. The training and ideologies of these people are no different from those of Prussian officers. Under the Treaty of Versailles, the defeated Prussian officers were able to rebuild the German army. How could the Japanese young officers scattered among the Japanese people not be dreaming and waiting for their opportunity? The Prussian concept of war is deeply ingrained in the hearts of Japanese young officers. In their minds, the end of World War II may be just the end of a battle, not the end of the war.</p>
<p>It is under the mutual erosion of these remnants of militarism and other harmful ideologies, as General MacArthur has said, that the true democratization of Japan will be threatened. We are confident that under the General's wise policies, these threats will not prevent the true democratization of Japan. Only under the circumstances of Japan's thorough democratization can the Japanese people themselves and world peace benefit from it.</p>
<p>Alas, the Man-Made Unemployed!</p>
<p>The great wheel of the era is constantly turning. Our environment is also constantly undergoing various changes, closely following this great wheel. Those who can adapt to these changes, innovate, and adjust to the new environment are called the fittest, while those who lag behind the times will inevitably be eliminated by nature. This is a very obvious and common principle.</p>
<p>However, "the observer sees clearly, while the person in the midst of it is confused." Those who are in the midst of the situation, clinging to old habits and reluctant to change, often follow the old ways, which is contrary to the trend of the times. This leads to many tragedies of failure and resentment. We deeply sympathize with these victims of the times. But their inertia is too deep, and their vision is too short. They only blame heaven and earth, and never change, so they ultimately cannot avoid the final tragic scene.</p>
<p>It has only been a short year since the victory. But the street vendors, the employees of massage parlors, the three-wheeled fish cart operators, and the dance hall owners have almost all disappeared with the tide. The back scrubbers, foot massagers, and rickshaw pullers are still struggling. There are also many middlemen, the so-called "brokers" in Shanghai, who were once prominent, but now, in these extraordinary times, as a result of direct allocation or the promotion of cooperation, have had to become victims of the times. These are all the results of socio-economic changes, which are inevitable and not intentionally caused by any party. Only by accurately assessing the situation and opportunely improving.</p>
<p>However, let's go back to the topic. If these sacrifices are indeed the result of socio-economic changes, we sincerely feel helpless. But if it is due to policy innovation and man-made causes, then it is worth considering carefully before making decisions and implementing them. That is, from the point of view of the matter itself, is it necessary to implement this? If it is considered necessary to implement, is it necessary to implement it immediately at this time and place, and is there a proper and appropriate arrangement? "Bad, I do my thing, and the life and death of the people are of no concern!"</p>
<p>The current economic problem and unemployment problem are really too serious! If it is not really necessary, it seems that it is not worth further increasing the severity of people's unemployment at this time. At this time and place, the best policy is to enable the people to recuperate and live in peace for a while. Last year, the police department planned to ban back scrubbing and foot massage, but later ordered a postponement, which was indeed an unbiased and very wise move. In terms of adapting to the times, it is especially worthy of our praise. Now we often hear a kind of specious argument, that is, on the one hand, strengthening the destruction of the status quo and increasing unemployment, and on the other hand, saying very simply that it can be taken care of by a certain organization for relief, as if the two sides can do their own thing. In fact, if you want to destroy, why provide relief? If you feel unable to provide relief, why destroy so much at once? Moreover, what organizations does the government have now that are always preparing to specialize in providing relief to those who are unemployed? We always feel that in the way of governing, the factors of time and place must always be considered first. This is the only task of a politician!</p>

<h3>Preliminary Results of Greek Referendum Revealed: Royalists Hold Overwhelming Advantage; King George II's Restoration No Longer a Problem</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Combined News] Under close observation by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the referendum to determine whether Greece should be a democratic republic or a constitutional monarchy was held on the 1st, with over 1.5 million voters. During the voting process, although clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups occurred in various locations, resulting in deaths and injuries, the overall situation was generally good. According to a report from the Associated Press yesterday (2nd), the results of voting in various districts have been successively revealed. Although there are still no official statistics at present, based on general estimates, approximately 70% to 80% of the votes support a constitutional monarchy. The restoration of King George II seems to be no longer a problem, but when he will return to the country has not yet been determined. The government announced on the 2nd that a total of 1,207,000 votes were counted, of which 924,540 votes supported the monarchy. However, the opposition party, consisting of three parties, held a meeting on the morning of the 2nd and decided to issue a statement denying the results of this vote, believing that there were irregularities, so they "will continue to fight for the establishment of a democratic republic."</p>
<p>Slavic Bloc's Attempts Backfire</p>
<p>Regarding this referendum, the "Resistance" newspaper in Paris published an article on the 1st analyzing why the royalists gained an overwhelming advantage, which was quite accurate. The article stated that the Greek left-wing originally could have won the referendum a few months ago, but due to the recent changes in the international situation, it has made the restoration of the monarchy in Greece possible. Although King George V has been accused of having a "pro-fascist attitude," under the direction of the Soviet Union, the representatives of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the Paris Peace Conference, and the representative of Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council in New York, separately launched offensives against Greece, which instead aroused the spirit of unity among the Greek people to cope with the threat of encirclement by Slavic nations.</p>
<h3>Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Hold Important Talks Yesterday; Committee Discusses Trieste Port Issue in Italian Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to hold important talks with US Secretary of State Byrnes at 7:00 PM today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that the meeting of the four foreign ministers originally scheduled for Monday afternoon has been postponed, and the new date has not yet been determined, but it will not be held before the end of next week. The British side expects that Soviet representative Molotov will soon return to Paris. Even if Molotov is absent, Vyshinsky can represent him at the four-power meeting. It is widely believed that Molotov's return home is to discuss the stalled progress of the Paris Peace Conference and to attend the first anniversary celebration of Japan's surrender on Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: The Political and Territorial Committee for Italy held a meeting this morning. Italian representative Bonomi attempted to overturn the principles set by the four powers, arguing that the new border of Italy's south in the Trieste region should be delineated using the Wilson Line rather than the line proposed by France. The committee then decided to postpone the discussion to give Yugoslavia sufficient time to prepare a response.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: Italian representative Bonomi suggested that a new subcommittee be appointed to study the three issues of the Isonzo River basin, the railway line, and the city of Gorizia. Regarding the Trieste port issue, he said that Italy cannot conceal its heartache that Italy is being suppressed for the sake of Yugoslavia's territorial sovereignty. Bonomi also requested that the southern part of the Trieste free zone be expanded to include the southwestern part of Rizstela. The four suggestions made by Italy are well-known, but now they have been put forward by Bonomi in a diplomatic way.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: The meeting of the representatives of the four foreign ministers to review the draft treaty amendments is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Bevin Guards Against Assassination; Accompanied by Twenty Bodyguards</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] Paris News: Ten detectives from the London Police Headquarters have arrived in Paris by air to protect the life of Foreign Secretary Bevin. Bevin's bodyguards have now been increased to twenty. In the past three nights, the hotel where Bevin is staying has received multiple anonymous phone calls, all of which contained threats.</p>
<h3>Italy to Bear $15 Billion in Reparations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st] The total reparations demanded from Italy by the countries concerned amount to a huge sum of US$15 billion. The Soviet Union's demand of $1 billion accounts for only a small part. Abyssinia, which is demanding compensation from Italy, is demanding $7.5 billion, far exceeding what the Soviet Union is demanding. Next, Greece is demanding $6 billion, Yugoslavia is demanding $1.3 billion, and Belgium is demanding $600 million. The Soviet Union ranks sixth in terms of reparations in the treaty.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 2nd Broadcast: The secretariat of the peace conference announced today that Egypt has submitted a memorandum requesting Italy to pay 10,038,593 Egyptian pounds in compensation.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister to Go to Paris</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 1st] The preparations for Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy's trip to Paris were extremely confidential. Nagy's trip is to give instructions to the country's representatives attending the peace conference on the border issues between Hungary and Romania and the exchange of ethnic minorities between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Expires, Compromise Hopeless; Fighting Begins in Central Luzon; Cannon Fire Heard 50 Miles from Manila</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 1st Special Dispatch] The ceasefire in central Luzon expired at midnight yesterday. The land occupied by the Hukbalahap forces was bombarded by enemy artillery. Two large armies from Nueva Ecija province and Tarlac province are attacking the concentrated areas controlled by the Communist-led Hukbalahap forces. The Hukbalahap forces are in danger of being surrounded. Malacañang Palace announced that President Roxas has received a telegram from Taruc, the supreme leader of the Hukbalahap, in which the wording is in effect a declaration of war against the government. The president has replied with a sternly worded response, stating that there is no possibility of compromise with those who violate the law. The president has notified the supreme leader of the Hukbalahap that arrest warrants have been issued for him on charges of murder. Philippine congressmen, with a few exceptions, yesterday all agreed to carry out punitive expeditions against the rebels in central Luzon. Although Manila is filled with rumors of panic and the sound of cannon fire can be heard 50 miles away, the atmosphere in the city this morning is still calm.</p>
<h3>City Enthusiastically Celebrates Independence Anniversary</h3>
<p>100,000 People Participate in Parade</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] Today marks the first anniversary of the proclamation of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has designated the 2nd as Independence Day, and all 24 million people of Vietnam are enthusiastically celebrating today. Ho Chi Minh, after returning here from China, was elected chairman of the provisional government. On this day last year, Ho Chi Minh broadcast to all of Vietnam at a mass rally in the city center of Hanoi, announcing Vietnam's independence. This was the first time Ho Chi Minh had met with the Vietnamese people since he began his movement to restore Vietnam. The Vietnamese government held a mass rally in Hanoi at 2:00 PM today. All the Vietnamese people in the city emptied their houses to participate. After the meeting, 100,000 Vietnamese people participated in a parade, with the procession stretching for ten li.</p>
<h3>Wellington Koo Delivers Speech at American Legion Convention</h3>
<p>[United Press, Wheeling, West Virginia, USA, 2nd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wellington Koo said in a speech at the American Legion national convention today: The current world situation is different from the past, and new problems have arisen as a result. These problems must also be solved with new and different methods. The post-war world is a new world, and the work of peace has only begun in Paris. Based on its current progress, it is impossible to predict when the treaty can be signed and when the world can focus on reconstruction.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Calls for Breaking Down Human Barriers and Promoting Good Neighborliness</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lincoln City, 1st] Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a speech to veterans here today, enthusiastically calling for the implementation of global good neighborliness, and saying that no people in any country want another global war. However, if the people of one country want to divide the peoples of two countries, they cannot become friends. Eisenhower did not specify which country he was referring to, but he was clearly referring to the Soviet Union and its allies. Eisenhower also said that it is useless to develop a one-sided spirit of good neighborliness by using strong barriers of humanity to separate one part of the people from other peoples. This is a matter of life and death, a disturbing problem, and we must face it head-on. It is puzzling why an attitude of kindness is rejected, and why the preparation of aid is put aside. Earlier, Eisenhower told reporters that he did not think the US military was demobilizing too quickly, and that 600,000 to 700,000 regular troops stationed abroad by the United States in 1948 would retire.</p>
<h3>Joint Naval Exercise Between British and American Navies to Be Held in the Eastern Mediterranean</h3>

During the exercise, the British air force will soar over the Greek islands. Finally, the fleet will sail to the Turkish Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<h3>Members of Indian Interim Government Sworn in Yesterday; Muslims Hang Black Flags in Protest; Major Riots Continue in Bombay</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Combined News] The seven main members of the Indian interim government were formally sworn in yesterday (2nd) morning. According to Reuters, the cabinet is allocated as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and Federal Affairs: Nehru (President of the Congress Party)</p>
<p>Defense: Singh (President of the Congress Party)</p>
<p>Home Affairs (including Intelligence and Broadcasting): Patel (Congress Party)</p>
<p>Finance: Matthai (Indian Christian)</p>
<p>Transportation (Transport and Railways): Asaf Ali (Muslim)</p>
<p>Agriculture and Food: Prasad (Congress Party)</p>
<p>Labor: Ram (President of the Depressed Classes Federation)</p>
<p>Health, Education, and Arts: Ammatgan (Muslim)</p>
<p>Legislation, Post and Aviation: Sakhir (Muslim)</p>
<p>Industry and Supply: Rajagopalachari (Congress Party)</p>
<p>Works, Mines, and Power: Bhabha (Congress Party)</p>
<p>Commerce: Babar (Leader of the Parsi Community)</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony was held at 11:00 AM on the 2nd in the square of the Viceroy's House in New Delhi. During the ceremony, Muslims climbed to the top of a 120-foot gate opposite the Viceroy's House and raised a black flag to show contempt and protest, but it was soon discovered and pulled down by the police. After the ceremony, Nehru came out onto the balcony and received enthusiastic cheers from the thousands of people below. However, because the Muslim League did not participate in the interim government and firmly expressed its unwillingness to cooperate, the day the new government was established was also the time when riots broke out across the country. According to Reuters, riots broke out in Bombay on the 1st, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and injuries. The Bombay government has declared a state of emergency. The turmoil was caused by the Muslim League instructing Muslims to hang black flags to show contempt for the Indian interim government, which led to demonstrations and clashes.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Associated Press, the Bombay riots have spread to new areas. As a result of the clashes between Indian and Muslims on the afternoon of the 2nd, at least sixty people have died. When the military police entered the disturbed areas, they were pelted with stones by the crowd. The police then opened fire in self-defense. Martial law has been implemented in the city, and at least 500 people have been arrested. About 200 people have been injured, 20 of whom are seriously injured.</p>
<p>Internal Strife Harms the Nation</p>
<p>Nehru, the leader of the new government, expressed deep regret for this kind of internal strife, saying, "We are still moving forward towards our goals, and the future is still very difficult." He expressed regret that "the Muslim League has taken another path," and said, "We still continue to hope for their cooperation, and the door to cooperation will always be open." According to the Associated Press, Nehru may lead the Indian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference for a short stay.</p>
<p>Ali Khan, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, said at a mass rally in Hol province on the 1st, "The direct action of the Muslim League is intended to make it impossible for the Nehru government to exercise its powers. We should launch a movement to refuse to pay rent, and politically and socially boycott Hindus and British people. We should also implement a scorched earth policy so that the Hindus cannot obtain the surplus grain in the Muslim areas."</p>
<p>Wang Shutao Delivers Speech</p>
<p>This City News: Wang Shutao, the director-general of the China-India Society, who recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that China and India have had relations for more than a thousand years. They have lived side by side without any wars, and the Himalayas have not hindered the exchange of culture. We are very pleased that India has achieved initial independence. In the future, China and India will join hands and cooperate, which will be a stabilizing force for world peace. Regarding the internal disputes in India, Wang believes that India will be able to resolve them itself, because the Indian nation has strong endurance. In the future, it may adopt a similar federal system and establish a great unified country. It is also heard that Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua, the supervisors and directors of the association, will send congratulatory telegrams.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends Congratulatory Telegram</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Among the congratulatory telegrams received by Nehru was one from Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, which read: "We wish you success. We are paying close attention to the situation in India, and we congratulate you on your past achievements."</p>

<h3>Tito Apologizes to the US for the Incident of Shooting Down American Planes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 1st Associated Press] Yugoslav President Marshal Tito today unofficially informed the United States that he apologized for the shooting down of two American planes, and assured that similar incidents would not occur again in the future.</p>
<h3>The Interior Ministry Announced a Revival Plan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Most People Will Engage in Agriculture</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 2nd] The Interior Ministry today announced a detailed five-year revival plan that will ensure that 60% of the Japanese people will be engaged in agricultural work after five years. The plan is based on the assumption that Japan's population will reach 80 million by 1950 and aims to transform the Japanese people's lives into an agricultural nation. In terms of industry, it will be limited to what is permitted in the peace treaty. According to the Interior Ministry's forecasts, Japan can be approximately 85% self-sufficient in food, with 85 million dou of grain imported annually from overseas offset by export trade. If this plan is implemented, Japan's unemployment problem can be solved. The population of major cities will be maintained at their current levels, and no new households will be allowed to move in. Reconstruction work will focus on smaller cities and rural areas. The number of Japanese people who will find work as a result of the revival plan will be 38 million, of which 20 million will be engaged in agriculture and fishing, and the rest will be engaged in industry and mining. In terms of industry, 6.3 million workers will be employed, a decrease of 3 million from the wartime peak. Factories and schools will be redistributed to adapt to this change.</p>
<h3>Nehru's Sister to Serve as Indian Representative</h3>
<p>Attending the United Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 1st] Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, will lead the Indian delegation to the United Nations organization meetings, representing India's protest against South Africa's discrimination against Indian residents. Mrs. Pandit is currently the Minister of Public Health of the United Provinces, the first Indian woman to serve as a cabinet member in a province.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Ambitions Are Worrying; U.S. Military Forces in the Pacific Are Insufficient for Self-Defense; U.S. House Military Committee Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 1st] Six members of the House Military Committee who inspected Tokyo issued a warning, saying: "A second Pearl Harbor incident is imminent." They expressed concern about Soviet ambitions and admitted that the U.S. military presence in the Pacific is insufficient for self-defense. Looking at the map of the North Pacific, the U.S. outer defense line is based on Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Japan, and southern Korea, with a small number of troops stationed in North China. Behind this defense line are Guam, Saipan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other bases. The Soviet Union, to the west of the Aleutians, has Commander Island, the Primorsky Krai, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, Siberia, northern Korea, and Lushun Dalian. The positions of both sides are now facing each other remotely. In terms of military strength, the U.S. Pacific Fleet is strong, far beyond the reach of the Soviet Union's few submarines. Although the Komsomolsk port in the Primorsky Krai has equipment for building larger warships, it cannot catch up. However, the Soviet army in Siberia far exceeds the total U.S. military strength in the western Pacific in terms of numbers. The whereabouts of the 750,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet Union in Northeast China are still unknown. Will they fight for the Soviet Union? This is still a matter of doubt. The most important question is the air force. Although the Soviet Union was the first to train paratrooper units before the war, with the invention of long-range bombers and air transport units in World War II, it is difficult to determine what use paratroopers still have. The strength of the Soviet air force, apart from its own fighter planes and aircraft acquired under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act, is unknown. The U.S. Air Force has made amazing progress, which is a visible fact. The B-29 Superfortress has become a thing of the past after the invention of the B-36 Stratofortress. Unmanned aircraft have also been successfully tested. The joint defense exercises between the United States and Canada in the Arctic Ocean are being conducted on a large scale, and both sides are engaged in V-2 rocket experiments. Finally, the United States has created the atomic bomb, while the Soviet Union is still researching it.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of the Occupation of Japan; MacArthur Issues Proclamation Yesterday; Tokyo Spends the Day Quietly Without Ceremonies; Nimitz Simultaneously Issues a Warning</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 2nd] MacArthur issued a proclamation today on the first anniversary of the occupation of Japan, mentioning the crisis of the struggle between democracy and communism in Japan. It stated briefly: What kind of concept will post-war re-educated Japan form? The answer to this question has a profound impact on the fate of mankind and the future of civilization. The conflict of ideas in Japan is not unfavorable to those seeking a democratic path in accordance with the intentions of the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese people, who have long been trained in extremely conservative right-wing theories, may easily be confused by radical theories. Democratic thought is the crystallization of human rights, justice, and integrity, and will be the cornerstone of Japanese freedom, unless it is destroyed and suppressed by the intrusion of hostile ideologies that despise individual dignity. The Japanese people's faith has been disillusioned by defeat in the war. Everything they believed in and lived for has been declared disintegrated. American soldiers came with excellent self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-control, implying to the Japanese people the hypocrisy of their former beliefs, thus causing a spiritual revolution, which is an unparalleled great change in the history of world society. If this spiritual reform is encouraged and given the opportunity to develop, its foundation will be deeper and more lasting than that entrusted to false beliefs. However, extreme ideas often gain the belief and support of true liberals due to incorrect propaganda and attractive slogans. Much has been achieved in the past year, but much remains to be done, proving that the power of democracy promotes lasting peace, and there have been significant gains. This gain must be consolidated and expanded. The way to do this requires patience and determination to shape the lives and institutions of the Japanese people based on the best social concepts and political standards. The goal is very great, because the strategic location of the Japanese islands, if not becoming a strong shield of peace, will become a springboard for war.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd] On the first anniversary of Japan's formal surrender, the U.S. conscription agency appropriately began its activities again to maintain the strength of the army as stipulated. Conscription will now be distributed to various stations in order to convene 25,000 young men aged 19 to 29, who will enlist in September after a two-month "conscription holiday."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 2nd, United Press] Today is the anniversary of Japan's surrender, but there were no special commemorative ceremonies here. Most of the Allied organizations stopped working, but this was because Labor Day happened to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the surrender document on the USS Missouri. Neither Americans nor Japanese held special programs. MacArthur worked as usual, spending the whole day holding meetings and doing other routine work. Japanese newspapers did not have editorials mentioning the anniversary, only the English-language Japan Times reminded the Japanese people that they have legal and moral obligations to the world to fulfill the Potsdam terms.</p>
<p>(Admiral Nimitz)</p>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd broadcast, Admiral Nimitz issued a warning on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, saying: The United States must have force as a backing in order to achieve a just peace. "I believe that Byrnes' views expressed in the peace conference must have authority, and this must be supported by a strong navy."</p>
<h3>Moscow Holds Huge Commemorative Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 1st] Moscow Radio announced today a huge plan for the Soviet Union to commemorate the first anniversary of the victory over Japan on September 3. The squares and streets of the Soviet capital have been decorated, and there will be large-scale parades and entertainment programs at that time.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Prices Soar; Congress Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Disputes Among Legislators Escalate into a Martial Drama</p>
<p>[United Press Brazilian Capital, 1st] Riots broke out here yesterday due to popular resistance to high prices. This ancient city of joy has now implemented martial law. Troops are patrolling the entire city to prevent further clashes. As a result of yesterday's conflict, one person died, a hundred people were injured, and five hundred people were arrested. The authorities announced that all stores in the city will open tomorrow under the protection of the military police. Emergency measures are now being taken in all aspects to cope with the economic crisis. Prices have tripled, and the black market is rampant. At the same time, Congress also held an emergency meeting to investigate the reasons for the soaring prices, which turned into a martial drama due to heated debates. Former President and current Senator Vargas strongly refuted the point that the current crisis should be the responsibility of the former government and demanded that those who criticize him meet outside the conference hall. When a legislator accused the Vargas government of being responsible for the turmoil, Catholic priest and legislator Camara punched another legislator in the nose. Some people claim that Brazilian prices have increased by 300% since 1944, causing demonstrations by salary earners, students, and workers, which have escalated into riots.</p>

<h3>A Dose of Refreshment; Steadily Passing the Mid-Autumn Festival; Pei Tsu-yi Expresses Confidence; Resolving the Difficulties of the Industrial Sector; Satisfactory Result of the Appeals of Speakers Pan and Hsu; Decision to Handle Small-Scale Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Pan Kung-chan, and the Deputy Speaker, Hsu Chi-kuang, have exchanged opinions with some industrial and commercial councilors in recent days, all of whom believe that the current factories are facing many difficulties and crises, and the money is extremely tight. The industrial loans previously approved for each factory have also been temporarily suspended. In this case, the future is really unimaginable. The Municipal Council will not open until the 9th of this month, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming in an instant. If we do not seek a solution in advance, then it will be too late. Therefore, the participants unanimously decided to elect Pan and Hsu as representatives to meet with the President of the Executive Yuan, Sung Tzu-wen, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Pei Tsu-yi, to state the pain of the industrial sector and request relief.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Pan and Hsu met with Pei, who said: "I have always been concerned about the industrial sector. I had planned a small-scale industrial loan method a month ago. At that time, private financial circles participated in the discussion. The plan was reported to President Sung. However, due to the foreign exchange adjustment, we had to temporarily take austerity measures. On the 31st of last month, I submitted the plan to President Sung again, and it was approved. Now it has been handed over to the Business Bureau of this bank for processing. The loan method is to form a group of every ten money shops, which will be jointly responsible for each other. Anything related to industrial production can be applied to the Central Bank for rediscounting. The loan amount for each group is 150 million yuan."</p>
<p>After hearing about the method, Pan and Hsu immediately expressed: "(1) The loan target is small-scale industries, and the scope may be too narrow; (2) Ten money shops only get a loan of 150 million yuan, which is worth 15 million yuan per shop. If used for industrial production, the amount is too small, and we hope to relax the amount; (3) Many banks also make industrial loans, and we hope to cover all banks."</p>
<p>Pei replied: "(1) Most of the factories in Shanghai are small-scale industries. Except for the yarn factories that are profitable and do not need loans, other factories can be said to be small-scale industries; (2) Relaxing the loan amount will be considered; (3) When planning this method, it was stipulated that factories mostly have dealings with money shops. Now it is decided that each bank will also handle it according to the above method."</p>
<p>Finally, Pan and Hsu said again: "The finances of this city must strive for stability so that it can gradually restore its vitality. The industrial sector has many difficulties, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. We hope to pass it safely. We especially hope to take into account Chairman Chiang's recent instructions: 'Production loans are not subject to austerity measures,' and do not implement austerity measures uniformly for the industrial sector." Pei replied: "The situation of the industrial sector will be paid attention to at any time. I am confident that there will be no financial accidents during this Mid-Autumn Festival. I will report the above situation to President Sung within today and tomorrow."</p>

<h3>Dying for Justice and Freedom; Colleagues in the Press World; Pootung Commemorates Loyal Souls</h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the number of employees of North American businesses in Shanghai who were killed in action almost exceeded the total number in other parts of the country. Their tragic deaths and their commendable and tearful deeds were admired by people across the country. Shanghai's press colleagues held a memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died in the Anti-Japanese War at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to commemorate the fifteen martyrs who died for justice and freedom, including Chu Hsing-kung. More than a hundred people attended, presided over by Pan Kung-chan and Cheng Chung-hang, standing supervisors of the Reporters Association, and assisted by Feng Yu-chen and others. In the center of the hall were the portraits and spirit tablets of Chu Hsing-kung, Chin Hua-ting, Chang Shih-hsu, Cheng Chen-chang, Shao Hsu-pai, Li Chun-ying, Feng Meng-yun, Chao Kuo-tung, Chen Tung-hsuan, Chou Wei-shan, Chin Chung-huan, Wu Hung-kuei, Chu Ming-chun, Wang An-lu, and Chen Kun-lin. In front of the stage were flower wreaths donated by Peng Hsueh-pei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Hsiao Tung-tzu, President of the Central News Agency, and the Association of Field Reporters. Around the stage were full of elegiac couplets and banners. The Shanghai Journalists Association wrote: "Uprooting traitors and eliminating enemies, the universe moves and the wind and thunder sound; tough grass withstands the severe frost, always leaving behind a spirit of uprightness. Taking righteousness to achieve benevolence, the light shines in Shanghai; loyal hearts and green blood, always emitting fragrance." Shen Pao wrote: "The wind is high and the moon is dark, and the demon rope spirals; it is a pity that the stubborn scholar, ten steps of fragrant grass splashed with green blood. After the rain, the sky is clear, the stove smoke is ethereal; you should miss your relatives and kindred spirits, a cup of imperial wine sprinkled on the heroic spirit." In addition, newspapers such as Hsinwenpao, Central News Agency, Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Minguo Daily, Wen Hui Pao, and Ta Wan Pao also made elegiac gifts.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony Begins</p>
<p>At 11 o'clock, the solemn and grand memorial ceremony began in mourning music. The presiding officer, Cheng Chung-hang, offered flowers and incense, and the whole body paid tribute to the martyrs. After silently mourning, the memorial text of the conference was read. The text read: "On September 2nd, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Journalists Association and all colleagues in the press world respectfully offer clear drinks and fragrant flowers to the spirits of the martyrs who died in the Anti-Japanese War: The vast land of Yu, based on Kunlun, history is long, relatives are distant and neighbors are harmonious. The killing intent surges, and the Eastern Ying starts; the pigs and snakes wreak havoc on their invasion. The light of the fire is blazing, causing shock; the reeds are clear, the moon is cold, and the Shanghai poison clouds are heavy. The anti-Japanese army rises, and the whole country is united. News warriors hold pens in the front row, exposing the hidden, more strict than axes. Not afraid of the strong, they suffer poison; sacrificing their lives for the country, green phosphorescence and green blood. Great are the martyrs, loyal and bright as the sun and stars; meritorious achievements are obvious, glorious and brilliant. Victory has been achieved, and monuments are erected; bamboo and silk leave fragrance, forever admired. Souls, come back, enjoy this clear wine, alas, alas, may you enjoy it."</p>
<p>Cheng Chung-hang Reports</p>
<p>Cheng Chung-hang, the chairman, then gave a report, saying briefly: Shanghai is the center of education, culture, and news in the country. For fifty years, from the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all major events in the country were launched in Shanghai. Shanghai's public opinion leads the country, and the encouragement and promotion of this Anti-Japanese War also caused great difficulties for press colleagues in the rear. For example, the great bombings of "May 3" and "May 4" in Chongqing in 1939. But no matter how crazy the enemy bombed, the newspapers in the rear did not stop publishing for a day until the victory. On the contrary, after the Allied air force bombed Osaka and Nagasaki in July last year, the enemy had no newspaper for three days. After hearing this news, we can be proud and believe that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War can be realized. The spirit shown in the press world can be seen. However, the spirit of colleagues in the occupied areas, especially in Shanghai, who fought against the enemy puppets, is beyond the reach of colleagues in the rear. When Mr. Zhang Ji-luan accepted the Missouri Award in 1941, he also specifically mentioned the great spirit of the Shanghai press world. This is because the rear has millions of troops to protect our editors and our speech. Although there are air raids, there are alarms so that we can calmly hide in air-raid shelters to avoid death. Colleagues in the occupied areas are not like this. They have no army to protect them and seek justice and peace in the midst of emergency alarms all day long. Now that victory has come, it is a successful struggle for world public opinion. In the United Nations Charter, the most important of the basic freedoms is freedom of speech. For the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the martyrs have sacrificed for basic freedom, human justice, and peace. Colleagues across the country should continue the spirit of the martyrs and strive for freedom of the press and basic human freedom.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Speaks</p>
<p>Pan Kung-chan then spoke as the Speaker of the Municipal Council, saying that the martyrs of the press world sacrificed for the struggle for basic freedom. In the future, to establish basic freedom, we must use the power of the press world—newspapers—and the people's opinion organs—all levels of councils—to cooperate with the ability of truly representative organs of public opinion, and value the freedom that everyone should have, at any cost, to protect human freedom, so that we can embark on the road of democratic politics. The Shanghai press world has a history of several decades, and it has done a lot for the country, both tangible and intangible. The martyrs disregarded sacrifices to promote justice for the national family and fight for the freedom of the entire nation. Their contribution will be even greater in establishing the road of democracy. Westerners have a saying: "Give me liberty or give me death." The martyrs died for this spirit, for freedom. In the future, I hope that the press world and the Municipal Council will cooperate, with all their spirit, to seek to protect the spirit of freedom and to lay the foundation for democratic politics.</p>
<p>Demands of the Family Members</p>
<p>After Pan finished his speech, Chang Wei, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, on behalf of the city government, paid tribute to the martyrs and encouraged those who died later to promote the righteousness of the martyrs. Finally, Shao Hsieh-hua, a family member of the martyrs, gave a thank-you speech, saying briefly that the martyrs stood in the position of the press, exerted their strength, and sacrificed for the survival of the country and the freedom of the nation. Today, I would like to express my gratitude to you for holding such a grand memorial service. I would also like to make three concrete demands on behalf of the families of the martyrs, and please convey them to the government: (1) Most of the martyrs were not buried properly in the turmoil, please allocate land to build a public cemetery and bury them immediately. (2) Please help the society and protect the lives of family members and the education of children to comfort the spirits of the deceased. (3) The commendable and tearful deeds of the martyrs should be handed over to the National History Museum and adopted as teaching materials to promote righteousness, so that the deeds of the martyrs will not be buried and unknown. The conference ended at 12:10.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Team Accepts New Cases; 400 Billion Big Fraud</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The receiving work investigation team originally planned to leave Shanghai for Hangzhou yesterday (2nd), but because there were too many cases of complaints and secret reports accepted, it was difficult to end them for a while, so it was temporarily decided to postpone it for a week, scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th of this month. In this last week, the investigation team is focusing on thoroughly investigating a 400 billion yuan big fraud case. The team received a secret report a few days ago that there was fraud in the enemy puppet materials received and managed by the Municipal Government Materials Receiving Management Office. The value of these materials reached 40 billion yuan. The case involves many senior officials, and Zhang Qing-zhen, a member of the investigation team, is working hard to investigate the case.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Han Jian Suspects; Two Puppet Members and One Factory Director</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard three cases of Han Jian suspects: (1) Tao Tzu-wen, a member and acting section chief of the construction section of the puppet Shangchu County Government, cut down trees, demolished the scenic spot of Jin Gu Ting, and forcibly recruited laborers to build barracks and roads for the enemy during his tenure. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. He confessed in court yesterday that the barracks and roads were built before he took office, and he could request an investigation, etc. (2) Chen Da-fang, the owner of the Da Fang Machinery Factory, was accused of contacting the enemy's 1629th unit during the enemy puppet period, and in July last year, he drove a large number of copper blocks from the enemy's army in the racecourse to the factory and hid them. After the victory, he was secretly reported. The defendant confessed that the copper blocks were buried before the war and denied that he had contacted the enemy unit. (3) Le Chia-chun, an investigator of the Fifth Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yi Chang Silk Village on Shandong Road in this city with the puppet section chief Lo Ching-ho during the war. After the victory, he was reported and sentenced to five years by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court. After being returned for a retrial, he confessed in court yesterday that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted, but was automatically sent as a festival gift. All of the above cases were adjourned for further hearing.</p>

He was arrested after the victory and detained in the High Prosecutor's Office in this city.

<h3>Citywide Occupational Census; Can Be Completed Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] After the police department and the civil affairs office started the citywide occupational census of citizens at 7:00 a.m. on the 31st of last month, 2.7 million people have been surveyed as of yesterday. According to the person in charge of the police department, he told reporters yesterday that this occupational census mobilized 3,600 people, divided into 1,800 groups. Because these people had undergone thorough assessment in terms of academic knowledge, attitude, and appearance in advance, the work progressed smoothly. It is expected that it will be completed tomorrow (4th). At that time, an accurate number of the total population of Shanghai and the number of employed, unemployed, and unemployed people can be obtained.</p>
<h3>"Flower of Peace" - After All, China Ranks Among the Four Great Powers; Even Sentient Plants Compose a Chapter</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] One summer seven years ago, lawyer Jin Gong discovered a potted "immortal's head" (also known as a cactus) at Wing On Company. After careful nurturing, it actually bloomed that year. The flower was white with a yellow center, possessing delicate, beautiful, cicada-like membranes within. Its stem resembled a trumpet, its form like an autumn chrysanthemum, and it was exquisitely fragrant. The flower bloomed between 8 and 9 p.m., and withered by noon the next day. In the following two years, although flower buds sprouted in profusion, they never opened. Since 1943, every summer, flowers have graced the plant, reliably blooming one at a time, reopening after wilting, with a maximum of three blooming simultaneously. Jin Gong used this to augur the fate of the nation, naming it the "Flower of Peace." Since the Japanese surrendered and victory was achieved, four flowers have bloomed simultaneously this year, which he believes signifies the image of the Four Great Powers. Heaven's will and human intention are surely not accidental. A photograph is included, along with this quatrain: "After all, China ranks among the Four Great Powers; even sentient plants compose a chapter. Heroes strive with all their might, heaven and earth are moved; the people have special honor, the nation has glory."</p>
<h3>Fake Official Demands Extortion and Opens Fire; Attempts to Escape by Crossing River; Gets Lost and is Captured</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A sentry of the Second Company, First Battalion, 436th Regiment, 146th Brigade of the Army, on guard duty near Longhua Airport, discovered a suspicious person attempting to cross a small river in the early morning of the first of this month, seemingly wanting to enter the airport, and immediately went forward to question him. Unexpectedly, this person turned and fled, discarding a pistol into the river. After the sentry pursued and captured him, he confessed his name was Chen Yonghui, twenty-seven years old, from Taipei. During the enemy puppet regime, he served as an economic advisor and secretary to the puppet government's Economic Commission. After the victory, he remained hidden in Shanghai. However, due to a lack of means to make a living, he broke into the home of a Westerner named Nash, a former assistant to the Shanghai Municipal Council and current representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China, on Lin Sen West Road at 3 a.m. that day, demanding extortion without success, and fired three shots. Because the Westerner shouted for help, he fled in a panic, intending to detour back to his residence near Hongkou. However, due to unfamiliarity with the terrain, he mistakenly arrived at Longhua and was arrested. The suspect has now been handed over to the Garrison Headquarters. After interrogation by the military court, he will be transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal proceedings today.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company Stopped Service Yesterday; Protesting Unreasonable Arrest and Assault of Ticket Seller Liang Guanghui by Naval Soldiers; Liang Guanghui's Life in Danger; Naval Authorities Promised to Punish the Culprits</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The tram, trolleybus, and red public bus lines belonging to the French Water and Electricity Company announced a cessation of service yesterday morning in protest against the unreasonable beating and serious injury inflicted on Liang Guanghui, a ticket seller of Route 18 trolleybus No. 392, by soldiers of the Second Battalion of the Navy Training Camp the previous evening. After the incident, the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union all sent personnel to the French Water and Electricity Company in Lujiawan to persuade all drivers and ticket sellers to resume work first while negotiations were underway. The labor union immediately expressed its consent, and the vehicles on each line resumed service at 10:05 a.m. The employees of the British tram company, in support of the actions of the French Water and Electricity Company employees, had notified the authorities that if the French company's matter was not resolved swiftly and satisfactorily, they intended to take united action. Fortunately, the French company resumed work immediately, and therefore the British tram company did not take any action.</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m., representatives from the Police Bureau, the Military Police Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Labor Union of the French Water and Electricity Company, the company authorities, and the Navy Training Camp held a meeting at the Taishan Branch Bureau on Lin Sen Central Road. Chief Zhu of the branch bureau presided over the meeting. First, Zhu Junxin, the representative of the labor union, reported the beginning and end of the unfortunate incident, stating briefly: At 7:18 p.m. the previous evening, the Route 18 trolleybus was traveling from the Great World entertainment center to Xieqiao. When it reached the Golden Theater, it stopped because of a red light. At that time, twelve navy soldiers wanted to board the bus. Ticket seller Liang Guanghui refused to open the door because it was not at a station. One of the soldiers climbed in through the window and forced the ticket seller to open the door to let the other soldiers on board. After entering the bus, they clashed with the ticket seller, even resorting to violence. At that time, a navy officer happened to be on the bus and stopped them. When the officer got off the bus at Nanyang Bridge, the soldiers became unbridled and beat the ticket seller again. After the bus arrived at Xieqiao, they actually took Liang to the camp and beat him severely again. It was already past midnight. When the labor union received the news, it immediately sent three representatives along with two military police officers to negotiate. They only released Liang at 2:15 a.m. Liang Guanghui was already covered in injuries and on the verge of death. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, he has not yet escaped danger. The labor union also put forward demands for punishing the culprits and for aftercare. Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi, the naval representative, stated that the culprits Zheng Fulin and others had already been placed under confinement and would be handed over to the military court for trial. If the victim died, he promised to execute the culprits. He also stated that he would strictly discipline the soldiers in the future to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The company authorities stated that they were willing to bear the medical expenses of the injured person, and it was decided that the Navy Training Corps would apologize to the Labor Union of the French Water and Electricity Company. The labor union representatives were satisfied, and the turmoil was resolved.</p>
<h3>Navy Forms Patrol Team to Assist in Maintaining Military Discipline</h3>

<h3>Okinawa Jeeps to be Shipped to Shanghai in Mid-Month for Distribution</h3>
<p>The registration for the distribution of jeeps to the press in this city by the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau has been going on for over a month. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the bureau, speaking to a reporter from the East China News Agency, regarding the distribution of jeeps to the press in this city, personnel were dispatched a few days ago to Okinawa Island to negotiate with the U.S. military authorities on transportation issues. It is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month, with between 300 and 500 vehicles. The number allocated to the press should be around 100. The selling price of each vehicle is US$1,600. The bureau is only responsible for repairing the machinery, and the buyers must take care of the rest, such as painting and assembly. The selling price of these surplus materials will be settled at a rate of 3,350 yuan due to exchange rate adjustments. However, the bureau is currently seeking instructions from the Executive Yuan as to whether to calculate the price for those who have already registered at the pre-adjustment rate of 2,020 yuan or at the new exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors Use Their Brains and Decide to Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Since the authorities decided to crack down on street vendors in areas such as Xikou Road in the city, street vendors have disappeared everywhere. It is learned that because the deadline is short and they cannot change their occupations in time, the street vendors convened a meeting yesterday and decided to send representatives to petition relevant authorities in Nanjing. The conditions they proposed are the same as those they proposed to the municipal government last time, requesting the government to designate areas for them to continue their business. It is learned that the street vendors have launched an organization to go to Nanjing to petition. There are about 2,000 street vendors in the city, and it is rumored that each person will contribute 20,000 yuan (a total of 40 million yuan) for activities in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Collective Charity Performance by Movie Stars Likely to be Difficult to Hold on the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the citywide charity singing performance by movie stars, which was originally scheduled to be held at the Great Light Theater on the 5th, last night at 7 p.m., the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association hosted the film industry at the Lidu Garden. More than 20 people, including Zhou Jianyun, Feng Xizui, Yan Youxiang, and stars Zhou Xuan and Wang Danfeng, attended. During the discussion of the program, they all felt that the performance time on the 5th was too rushed. The stars participating in the singing still needed a short period of practice. As a result, it was decided that Zhou and Yan would do their best to arrange it. If they really could not perform, the association would be notified to reschedule. In addition, the charity screenings in seven cinemas last Sunday raised a total of 2.2 million yuan (excluding donations), bringing the total amount raised, including the first time, to about 5.7 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Materials from Jiang's Case Begin to be Inventoried and Auctioned</h3>

<h3>720 Translators Hope to Go Abroad En Masse</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The translators of the former Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, since the government explicitly ordered their demobilization, some of their schooling and career problems have not been resolved. And the government had previously promised that 20% (720 people) of all translators would go abroad for further study, but although the Demobilized Translators Friendship Association has repeatedly requested it, only 10% have been approved. The association hosted the local press at the Atlantic Restaurant last night, reporting and proposing four points, requesting the government to achieve: (1) In addition to the 360 translator study abroad places that have been approved, please continue to send out the other 360. (2) Translators who have continuation certificates from American schools are allowed to study abroad at their own expense without conditions. (3) Please the government immediately find a way to settle unemployed translators. (4) Please the government give the families of translators who died for their country reasonable compensation.</p>
<h3>Failure in Gold and Stock Speculation - Huakang Bank Collapses</h3>
<p>Loss of More Than 100 Million Yuan, Zhu Langsun Flees Without a Trace</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] After this foreign exchange rate increase, general speculators misunderstood the government's policies and took the opportunity to raise gold and stock prices, resulting in serious blows. On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Huakang Bank, located at No. 2 Guizhou Road, suddenly announced its closure yesterday morning due to speculative failure and lack of liquidity. It is reported that the affected parties reached more than 100 million yuan. The manager of the bank, Zhu Langsun, has fled without a trace. It is learned that the bank has been engaged in buying and selling red card securities on behalf of customers. During the recent wave of foreign exchange adjustment, it used customer funds to purchase a large number of red cards. As a result, the red cards plummeted, and the losses accumulated. It had no choice but to deceive customers with long-term post-dated checks and gold deposit receipts. After the closure yesterday morning, Ma Huaizhen reported to the Laozha District Bureau that he had been defrauded of 50 taels of gold, and Fan Bin was defrauded of 10 taels. The total number of post-dated checks that have not yet expired exceeds a huge amount of 100 million yuan.</p>
<h3>To Prove Ownership of Tricycles, Owners Should Collect Certificates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau has approved the individual registration of 2,633 tricycles for business operations this year.

The bellboy discovered it and quickly called for a car to take him to Renji Hospital. The man was still unconscious due to an overdose of poison, and there was concern for his life. According to reporters, the suicide victim was named Liu Heming, 23 years old, from Zhejiang, and worked at a department store in Hangzhou. Recently, because the department store's business was sluggish, it planned to close after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Heming met a local woman named Hong Suqiu in the spring, and they fell in love. The spring breeze changed, and a secret pregnancy resulted. The matter was learned by the woman's father, and since what's done is done, he could only urge Heming to get married as soon as possible. However, Heming was unlucky, with no savings and the company about to close, so the wedding could not be resolved. Heming had an older sister living in Shanghai, who invited him to stay with her temporarily, but Heming was proud and considered relying on others to be shameful. Therefore, the day before yesterday, he opened a room at the Yangzi Hotel at No. 704, and suddenly had the idea of ending his life due to this double blow. Before committing suicide, he wrote two farewell letters, one to his girlfriend Hong Suqiu, which said in brief: The company closed, I cannot afford the wedding, I am ashamed to face you, so I have to commit suicide. Please keep the name ring I gave you as a memento. You are already four months pregnant, take good care of yourself, etc. The other letter was addressed to his older sister, also declaring his intention to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>Child Burned to Death in Fire</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 12:34 p.m., a fire broke out on the third-floor attic of No. 125 Wuzhou Road. A child, about twelve or thirteen years old, who lived there was severely burned. He was sent to the Shanghai Sanitarium on Old Bazai Road, but died of his injuries.</p>
<h3>Workers Organize and Commit Assault, Stabbing Four Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Houde Building on Minguo Road, Xinkaihe (formerly the Flour Exchange), has part of its premises rented to the Dagong Daily as a printing factory. The remaining houses are rented to the Shanghai Branch of the Chongqing Fuxing Military Uniform Factory, where the entire seam-sewing department works. There is also a motor vehicle department, whose factory is located at No. 471 Limalu, Nanshi. Several workers from the motor vehicle department stayed overnight in the Houde Building. At about 9 p.m. last night, when two workers from the motor vehicle department returned to the dormitory, the seam-sewing department had not yet finished work and was collecting military uniforms from the female workers, so they prevented them from going upstairs, which led to an argument. The two workers went away unhappily, but half an hour later, they gathered more than 20 workers from Nanshi, secretly carrying sharp knives and beer bottles, and rushed over, hitting anyone they saw and stabbing workers in the seam-sewing department with sharp knives. Hu Yuqing (22 years old) was stabbed in the left waist, Yang Degen (32 years old) in the left arm, Cui Guiqing (25 years old) in the right knee, and Shen Yicai (28 years old) in the left chest and lungs, suffering the most serious injuries. After causing the trouble, the factory closed the iron gate and reported to the Yimiao Branch Bureau, which ordered a large number of police officers to the scene and detained more than 40 workers for interrogation. The four injured workers were sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>How Living Index is Calculated; Based on Average of 54 Daily Necessities; Objects of Investigation are Items of Greatest Consumption by Public</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Currently, nothing is more closely related to anyone than the cost of living index published by the municipal government every month. What kind of materials is this index based on? What kind of methods are used to calculate it?</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, here is a basic formula for calculating the cost of living index:</p>
<p>It looks very simple. All that is needed to know is the price of goods and the average consumption. However, collecting all kinds of accurate data is not an overnight effort. Shanghai began compiling the cost of living index in 1926, and the base period for the current calculation is 1936.</p>
<p>The objects of investigation for the price of goods are the most commonly used or consumed items, divided into four categories: food, clothing, housing, and miscellaneous goods. Recently, there are a total of 54 kinds. The method is to select a number of areas and use the shops or markets with the most consumers as data providers. The municipal research office sends personnel every Wednesday to investigate the market price of various goods. These investigators all have many years of work experience and are very familiar with the objects they are investigating, so the results they obtain are generally quite accurate. Furthermore, the price of each item must be determined by combining the average of the prices quoted by at least ten different businesses before it can be determined as the market price of a certain item in a certain week. Then, the average of the market prices for four weeks or five weeks is taken as the price of a certain item in a certain month.</p>
<p>As for the average consumption, because it changes very little, the current calculation of the workers' index is still based on the results of the 1942 survey of 305 worker families, and the officials' index is based on the results of the 1941 survey of 418 official families. The method is to have these hundreds of selected families record the details of their daily expenses in a specially designed account book, and then the investigating agencies classify, synthesize, and analyze these account books to obtain the average total consumption of a certain item by each family in a year, and then divide it by twelve months to obtain the average monthly consumption.</p>
<p>The numbers obtained in this way are then subjected to a comprehensive average according to the above formula to obtain the monthly cost of living index, which is used by various social strata to calculate salaries and wages.</p>
<p>Many people do not understand the calculation method of the cost of living index and believe that it does not match the actual prices. To give a recent example, it is a fact that prices have jumped after this foreign exchange liberalization, but the published workers' cost of living index for August increased by only 0.95% compared to July, so its accuracy is highly doubted. However, according to those responsible for compiling it, this is actually a misunderstanding, because the cost of living index is calculated using an average value. This exchange rate change occurred in late August, so its impact is naturally very small when averaged over the entire month. Furthermore, the investigation of commodity prices is based on the items that are most consumed by the public. For example, rice prices have changed very little recently, and many items that have risen sharply are not among the 54 items. This is also an important reason why the cost of living index has risen very little.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang and Wife Leave Shanghai to Study Water Conservancy Projects in the United States; Madame He Yingqin Leaves on the Same Ship</h3>

<h3>The Increasing Seriousness of Educational Problems: Education Minister Zhu Seeks Instructions from the Chairman; Deputy Minister Hang Remains in the Capital, While Deputy Minister Zhu Accompanies Him to Kuling</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] With the current situation unstable, the seriousness of educational problems is also increasing daily. Education Minister Zhu Jiahua and Deputy Minister Hang Jingnong have both gone to Kuling to make certain representations to the Chairman. Only Deputy Minister Hang Liwu remains in the capital to oversee ministry affairs. A reporter inquired about issues such as educational funding, post-war reconstruction, student enrollment, and professor待遇s. The responses were as follows: (1) The difficulty in securing educational funding is the biggest problem currently faced. The reconstruction and development of education at all levels in the recovered areas require funding. The Ministry of Education has drafted a budget requesting an increase in reconstruction funds. This proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and a decision is expected shortly. (2) The reconstruction of various schools has been affected by poor transportation and has not reached the expected situation. The supply and demand of primary and secondary schools in various places are imbalanced, and the problem of students dropping out of school has also arisen. The Ministry of Education is deeply concerned about this. However, if there are no problems with funding, increasing the number and capacity of public schools can gradually solve the problem. (3) Regarding the enrollment problem of students returning to their hometowns from universities in the rear, such as Chongqing University, the Ministry of Education has designated universities such as National Central University to hold transfer student examinations on a regular basis. Every effort will be made to provide them with convenience and opportunities for light study. Even if they fail the examination, they can still return to their original school to study, so as not to drop out of school. The travel expenses for returning to their original schools are a minor problem. (4) After the reconstruction of universities, the living environment of university professors is often poor, and research equipment is even more lacking. Life is not easy in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, and the situation is extremely difficult. The Ministry of Education is very anxious about this. Although the research funding for professors has recently been increased to five yuan, it is still not enough to solve the problem. The Ministry of Education can only find ways to remedy the situation at any time.</p>
<h3>The Serious Problem of Students Dropping Out of School in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd] It is estimated that the number of primary and secondary school students dropping out of school in Guangzhou has reached 150,000. In terms of secondary schools, there are only seven provincial secondary schools and three municipal secondary schools. In the city of Guangzhou, which has a population of over one million, there are only ten secondary schools, which is enough to make people understand the seriousness of the problem of students dropping out of school. In the entrance examination for this semester, Provincial No. 1 Middle School admitted 600 students, and nearly 30% of the applicants failed. Due to the large number of students dropping out of school, private secondary schools have been established one after another, most of which are speculative. The quality of their equipment and teachers is quite questionable. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 48 private secondary schools, most of which charge exorbitant fees, making it difficult for the children of ordinary civil servants to attend.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang to Establish a Library in Lushan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 2nd] Madame Chiang recently decided to donate funds to establish a well-equipped library. She will choose between Lushan and Shanghai to build the library site. It is said that Lushan is more likely to be chosen.</p>

The Ministry of Education, together with the Central Library and various universities, has organized a distribution committee to hold meetings regularly to distribute them.</p>
<h3>The Summer Camp in Nanjing Concludes; A Youth Training Class is Established</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Nanjing Summer Camp of the Youth League has concluded. The trainees are mostly students from the Nanjing Temporary University Preparatory Class and young people who have fled to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. After leaving the camp, they will inevitably suffer from the hardship of dropping out of school and unemployment. Secretary-General Chen of the Central League Headquarters, seeing this, has set up a youth training class at the original site of Tangshan. Registration and team formation have already begun, and it has been formally established.</p>
<h3>The First Day of Business at the National Goods Charity Market is a Great Success</h3>
<p>The National Goods Charity Market, organized by the Shanghai Education Loan Committee, etc., had its opening day the day before yesterday. The business was very prosperous.

<h3>Mayor Wu Convenes a Meeting of Private School Principals to Discuss Improving Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mayor Wu convened a symposium of principals of private primary and secondary schools in the city at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 2:00 pm yesterday. Those present included Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department, Director Zhu Xubai of the Municipal Government News Department, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau, and principals of various private schools, totaling 92 units. Mayor Wu apologized for his late arrival at 2:40 pm due to hosting a luncheon for American congressmen at his residence. He then said that since the tuition fees of various schools were set several months ago, the municipal government has received a large number of letters from citizens, and editorials in newspapers have also criticized the fees, so he felt it was necessary to reconsider them. However, if the tuition fees are too low, the lives of teachers and staff cannot be stabilized, which is also not a good plan. Today's meeting of private school principals is to collectively discuss and seek a win-win solution.</p>
<p>Then, Jiang Jizhou, principal of Minguo Middle School and chairman of the Municipal Federation of Primary and Secondary Schools, Gao Baiba, principal of Huahua Middle School, Zhou Zenglin, principal of Shanghai Middle School, Liu Boheng, principal of Guangzhong Middle School, Shen Wu, principal of Xinhua Girls' Middle School, Cui Yiwu, principal of Daozhong Girls' Middle School, and Sun Xiangzhong, principal of Aiguo Girls' Middle School, spoke in detail on issues such as tuition, fees for meals and accommodation, raising teachers' salaries, expanding school facilities, providing free admission for poor children, and making school finances public. Finally, Mayor Wu put forward various opinions, which were discussed in detail. The conclusions reached were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each school should deposit the tuition fees collected into a bank (determined by the school itself), and all interest should be listed under the school's financial expenses. (2) Each school should report the amount of income to the school's audit committee twice, once after the start of the semester and once before the end of the semester. At the same time, the school should announce it publicly and report it to the Education Bureau for record. (3) Each school's free places should be handled in accordance with the proportion (15% for each middle school and 20% for each primary school). (4) Student meal fees should be collected in installments, and a meal committee should be organized to handle it. Parents who are willing to pay in one lump sum are allowed. (5) The various fees collected by each school should be used in accordance with the prescribed items. After the above decisions were made, Shen Wu, principal of Xinben Women's Primary School, filed a complaint about the school's funds being forcibly occupied by military man Jin Handing. Director Zhang of the Health Bureau also expressed his views on health education in schools, saying that the municipal government will restore the Health Education Committee, with the mayor as the chairman and the director of the Education Bureau as the vice-chairman. He hoped that each school would attach equal importance to "teaching" and "education," and that the health fees collected by each school must be taken from the school and used for the school. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 pm.</p>

<h3>A Humble Proposal to Improve Secondary Education in Shanghai (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Engao</p>
<p>To improve secondary education in Shanghai, from an objective point of view, it seems that intensifying material construction is the most important thing. Educational facilities cannot be without tools, and material equipment is one of the important tools for educational facilities. A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well. A poor material environment will never produce high-quality educational effectiveness. Without complete science laboratory equipment, there is no way to talk about the provision of science education; without suitable farming and industrial practice places, there is no way to talk about the promotion of labor education; without the construction of gyms, sports fields, and swimming pools, there is no way to talk about the training of strong physiques; without a complete library, there is no way to talk about the cultivation of good learning attitudes. All other equipment is related to the effectiveness of implementing education. Good and effective results can never be obtained by chance. Although the number of secondary schools in Shanghai is very developed, their material equipment is really extremely pitiful. Except for a few with a slight foundation, most of them rent private houses as classrooms. There is no talk of lighting and ventilation, and other things are even more nominal. This kind of secondary education, except for training the ability to use writing tools and imparting abstract book knowledge, has no other harvest. If education is to exert great power, it must permeate the entire life of students. Students regard schools as relay stations, coming to class and leaving after class. Because of the limitations of insufficient material equipment, the opportunity for teachers and students to live together during the week is almost zero, and there is no way to see the effect of mutual spiritual induction. Letting young people pursue themselves in the social storm and float and sink with the customs is too dangerous and contrary to the original intention of educational facilities. Education is not only about material equipment to fulfill its function, but without material equipment, even if there are educational experts, there is no place for them to use their talents. Especially in the secondary education era of the youth stage, it must rely on a rich material environment to complete its beautiful and reasonable educational life, so that students' body and mind can be developed in a balanced way. Otherwise, it is an incomplete secondary education. This kind of incomplete secondary education has more harm than good to the country and society.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing, the improvement of secondary education in Shanghai can be summarized into the following three principles:</p>
<p>(1) Since the number of schools has already had considerable development, we should pay attention to improving the quality of schools in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Since the number of private secondary schools is greater than that of public secondary schools, in order to improve the quality of schools effectively, we must determine an effective and universal improvement method for private secondary schools.</p>
<p>(3) Since improving the quality of schools takes improving material construction as a prerequisite, we should make overall plans for the majority of private secondary schools that are materially poor in the future, and cooperate to thoroughly renovate their material environment within a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>How can the above-mentioned ways to improve secondary education in Shanghai be achieved and achieve its purpose? This is the suggestion that this article wants to put forward.</p>
<p>In the last semester, the total number of students in public and private secondary schools in this city was less than 80,000. In this semester, students from the rear have returned to Shanghai one after another, and the number of secondary school students may increase to 100,000. In three to five years, it may increase to 200,000 to 300,000. Assuming that 200,000 secondary school students are the design goal, and each secondary school is assumed to accommodate 1,000 to 1,500 people, only 140 to 200 secondary schools can accommodate all of them. Even if the number of secondary school students expands to 300,000, if the capacity of each secondary school is also expanded to 1,500 people, there is no need to increase the number of 200 secondary schools, and they can still accommodate all of them. At present, there are less than 80,000 secondary school students, but the number of public and private secondary schools has reached as many as 226. The average number of students in each secondary school is less than 400. In terms of effectiveness, it is inevitably low. For the improvement direction, the few private secondary schools that are hopeless due to excessive manpower and material resources should first be advised to merge, shut down, or change to primary schools. Retain those hundred and dozens of schools with a long history, significant results, sound yellow guild organization, and qualified teachers, except for more than ten schools such as Private McTyeire School and Xuhui Middle School, whose material construction has reached a considerable scale and does not need to be rebuilt. Other articles can gather the strength of both the government and society to seek new construction. This new construction must be economical, practical, and most suitable for the ideal of implementing youth education. How to realize this plan, according to my meaning, in the east, west, south, and north suburbs of Shanghai, we should use the original public land or requisition private land to open up four major secondary education zones, each zone with an area of ​​1,500 mu to 2,000 mu, with the construction of 30 to 40 secondary schools as the scope, and with the target of accommodating 30,000 to 60,000 secondary school students. For example, the Hongqiao Airport in the west district was originally a centralized military training camp for high school students and above in Shanghai. Later, due to the tense situation between China and Japan, it was ordered by the central government to expand the requisition of nearby private land to become an airport, covering an area of ​​more than 1,000 mu. Later, because the Longhua and Jiangwan airports were opened, the Hongqiao Airport was abandoned and unused. Today, weeds are overgrown and it has become a livestock farm for nearby farmers. If the local government submits a report to the central government to allocate it for the construction of a secondary education zone, turning useless into useful, would it not be the good fortune of Shanghai alone!</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders the Municipal Government to Pay Attention to the Selection of Baojia Heads, Thoroughly Eliminate Malpractices, and Prevent Government Orders from Being Distorted</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan yesterday ordered the Municipal Government, saying: "An investigation into the situation of the people in various districts has led to the distortion of government orders. We must pay attention to the selection of Baojia heads, thoroughly eliminate malpractices."</p>
<p>The 22nd District Mediation Committee</p>
<p>The 22nd District Office (Jiangwan) held its 7th district affairs meeting on the 31st. Deputy District Chief Xu reported first, stating that the previous Deputy District Chief Ni had resigned and his resignation had been approved. The vacancy will be filled by himself. Then, he explained the work, and the heads of each section also reported on the work done in the past month. They also discussed proposals on the spot, including the following important items: (1) The personnel adjustment in this district should be approved by the Municipal Government as soon as possible; (2) A mediation committee should be organized immediately; (3) Investigate and report enemy and puppet property and public construction matters; (4) Prepare for the welfare of colleagues in this district, etc. In addition, Xu Zhongtian, the head of the 5th Bao, and Jin Jindi, the head of the 9th Bao, in the district have resigned. The district office has elected Li Shangda as the head of the 5th Bao and Jin Shouliang as the head of the 9th Bao.</p>
<p>The 23rd District Repairs Zhoujiaqiao</p>
<p>The Zhoujiaqiao bridge in the 6th Bao of the 23rd District (Wusong) has been in disrepair for many years. The district office has submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to survey and repair it. In addition, the corner of Hongsong Road and Zhongxing Road in Wusong Town had a self-police pavilion built during the enemy and puppet period. Because no one managed it after the victory, it is now leaning and collapsing. Whether it should be demolished has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>The Wusong Exchange of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation is temporarily located downstairs in the 23rd District Office. All the wires to the city have been installed and communication began on August 30.</p>
<h3>The Civil Affairs Department Explains the Questions Regarding Migration Registration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Civil Affairs Department, according to a signed report from the 5th District Office, forwarded a report from Han Shoukang, the head of the 62nd Bao, and others, stating that there are several questions regarding the investigation and reporting of households: (1) All the tenants of a three-room house have moved away, and they did not return the lease in advance, nor did they report the move-out to the Bao. Afterwards, the citizens even took away their National ID cards. Can the second landlord or another head of household living together report this type of household? How should this Bao investigate and report it? (2) The tenants of a three-room house have moved their belongings away without returning the lease or making any statement, whether they are returning to their hometown or will come back to live again, and they have not reported to the Bao or reported a temporary floating household registration. The door is locked and they do not return for several months to a year and a half. How should this Bao investigate and handle this type of household? (3) The situation is the same as the previous one, but there are still one or two pieces of waste left in the room. The Civil Affairs Department once answered a question from Mr. Changhong in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao: "The door is locked, which seems to indicate an intention to return." The Baojia believes that "if there is an intention to return, the household should also report a temporary floating household registration to the Bao when moving out in order to be able to check and comply with the procedures. Since they did not report and locked the door for several months or a year, it is similar to a fugitive population." How should the Baojia investigate and handle it? There are also unscrupulous Baojia heads who often rely on their position to oppress the people, causing resentment. All levels of local government should eliminate this malpractice and order them to be informed. Some cunning tenants of a three-room house take this opportunity to transfer the house to a fourth party and make a huge profit from it. Therefore, the house is locked first. Once the fourth party moves in, if the second landlord inquires, the fourth party will rely on having a lease right with the third tenant and ignore it. If the second landlord sues the third tenant, the third tenant has disappeared. (4) How should fugitive populations be investigated and reported? Should we only report that a certain household has now moved out and we do not know where they have moved to? Please explain the above four points so that we can follow them.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department explained in detail as follows: (1) If the tenants of a three-room house move out without applying for a move-out, the head of the Bao in charge may apply on their behalf. (2) If the move-out has been more than a month and has not been applied for registration as a move-out, the head of the Jia or head of the Bao in charge may apply on their behalf. (3) "The door is locked, which seems to indicate an intention to return" is a factual inference. However, the registration of a floating population or the registration of a move-out must still be applied for in accordance with the law, because after applying for a move-out, it is not impossible to return. To prevent abuses in house leasing, please consult with the competent authorities on appropriate measures. (4) The fugitive population should still apply for a move-out by the head of the household. As for fugitive households, it can be explained according to point 1.</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>
<p>The District People's Representative Conference of the 12th District (Beining) of this city will hold its first meeting at 8:00 am today in the auditorium of the Municipal Public Experimental School at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road.</p>
<h3>Household Registration Regulations: Questions and Answers (Continued)</h3>
<p>(62) Question: When there is a change in the place of original registration or temporary registration, the relevant household registration officer should be notified to register the cancellation of the original registration or the transfer of the temporary registration, according to the law. However, there are no columns for the relevant and governing household registration officers on the household registration application form. If the receiving household registration officer cannot notify, what should be done?</p>
<p>Answer: The applicant may indicate the administrative region of the relevant or governing household registration at that time in the remarks column of the application form.</p>
<p>(63) Question: What surname should an illegitimate child take?</p>
<p>Answer: An illegitimate child is a child born out of wedlock under the Civil Code. If the parents are untraceable, the child is considered abandoned in household registration terms. According to Article 58, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law, the household registration officer should establish a surname and given name for the child. If the abandoned child has been adopted, the child should take the surname of the adopter, as stipulated in Article 1078 of the Civil Code. The application for birth registration can be processed using the usual procedures. Furthermore, if the mother of a child born out of wedlock marries someone else, the child should take the mother's surname, according to Article 1065, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association</h3>
<h3>Will Intervene in Times of Tight Credit</h3>
<h3>Representing 160 Banking and Money Shop Units</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association, which has been in preparation for years, finally held its inaugural meeting at the Bankers' Club at 3 p.m. yesterday. The seven executive committee members present were Li Fusun, Xu Weiming, Li Daonan, Xu Jiguang, Qian Xinzhi, Qin Runqing, and Shen Rixin, along with 134 members from various banks and money shops, representing a total of 160 units. Li Fusun was publicly elected as the chairman of the meeting. Li delivered a speech reporting on the association's preparations, stating that the association was a continuation of the former Banking Association Joint Reserve Association. Although the organization has expanded with the inclusion of money shops, the association's work has not been interrupted. Its establishment coincided with the aftermath of the January 28th Incident. On the day following the outbreak of the war, a citywide strike was held, creating a serious situation. The Joint Reserve Association was established within a few days, accumulating over 40 million in assets, effectively increasing the deposit reserves among the banking community by over 20 million, thereby stabilizing the market. Since then, whenever political issues have caused financial turmoil, the Reserve Association has intervened to facilitate a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Preparations After Victory</p>
<p>After the victory, preparations were made with the Money Trade Association to establish the Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association, and a draft covenant was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Approval was finally received from the Ministry of Finance at the end of June this year. A joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the Banking Association, and representatives of the board of directors and supervisors of the Money Trade Association was convened on July 10th. As the association's affairs required urgent planning and implementation, all members of the first executive committee were nominated by the two associations, with five members from the banking industry and two from the money trade. Qin Runqing and Shen Rixin were nominated as the two representatives from the money trade. The five members from the banking industry were the five standing committee members of the Joint Reserve Association, who continued in their roles. The joint meeting unanimously approved and commenced preparations. On the one hand, letters were sent to various banks and money shops to solicit membership and sign the association's covenant. The phrase "joint guarantee" in the covenant received the most attention from the various banks and money shops. An explanation was requested from the Ministry of Finance through the two associations, and a ministry order has now been received stating that when joint guarantee liability arises, it should be borne in proportion to the number of treasury bills each member bank and money shop actually holds at the time. This has been incorporated into the association's articles of association for compliance. The Executive Committee reported during the preparation period: (1) To determine the amount of assets that member banks and money shops should subscribe, it was decided that 10 million yuan would be the minimum and 20% of the average deposits for the most recent three months would be the maximum. (2) To determine the term of office for executive committee members to be three years. (3) To draft the association's articles of association in accordance with the covenant, incorporating the Ministry Order's explanation of the original text of the joint guarantee for compliance. The standard for sharing expenses will be based on the proportion of the total amount of assets subscribed, as stipulated in the covenant. However, there is a significant difference in the total amount subscribed by the banks and money shops (ranging from 10 million to 1.8 billion yuan). Since the Reserve Association serves the banks and money shops equally, it would be unfair to base the proportion solely on the assets subscribed. It is proposed to set a basic amount, assuming 50,000 yuan per bank and money shop, and apportion the expenses based on the proportion exceeding this amount, which seems more equitable.</p>
<p>Hoping for Prudence First Among Peers</p>
<p>Now that the association is in its initial stage of operation, I have a few words to report to the general assembly. The association was originally founded with the aim of mutual assistance among peers, at a time when the country is in turmoil and the financial situation is unstable. National banks are also advocating a tightening policy. I hope that our peers will prioritize prudence during this period and hope to weather the difficulties. When the nation is stable, we can then unleash our efforts. The Reserve Association can only serve as a mechanism to resolve tight credit situations. When the city's credit situation is tight, the Reserve Association will come forward, and the Central Bank will provide support. During normal operations, I ask that each bank and money shop maintain its position and respond to the situation as it sees fit. Do not have excessive expectations of the Reserve Association, so that the Reserve Association's foundation can be increasingly consolidated, valued by society, and valued by the government. Only then can it come forward to deal with difficult situations. This is a sincere piece of advice from me. Please understand.</p>
<p>Passed Thirty-Two Articles of Association</p>
<p>The meeting then discussed and passed thirty-two articles of association. Here is an excerpt of the major points: Regarding the reserve assets, Article 6 stipulates: Member banks and money shops should determine the amount and prepare reserve assets of equivalent value. In the event of a decline in value or other changes, they shall be responsible for making up the difference at any time. The amount of reserve assets subscribed shall not exceed 20% of the average monthly total deposits of each bank and money shop over the past three months, and shall not be less than 10 million national currency. Article 7 stipulates that the reserve assets are limited to the following categories: 1. Government-issued bonds and other securities approved for listing on the stock exchange. 2. Investment certificates approved by the Ministry of Finance. 3. Real estate in the city that is legally registered, has a market price, and can be sold at any time. 4. Warehouse receipts for goods that can be sold immediately. Regarding treasury bills: Article 11 stipulates that the reserve assets paid by member banks and money shops will be issued treasury bills at 70% of the appraised value. Article 12 stipulates that treasury bills are registered. Article 13 stipulates that member banks and money shops may use treasury bills as collateral for debts. If the debt is not repaid, the association may handle it in accordance with Article 13 of Chapter 4 of the covenant. (This article stipulates that if a member bank or money shop uses treasury bills as collateral for a debt and fails to repay it, the association shall, at the request of the creditor bank or money shop, immediately sell all or part of the original reserve assets paid by the debtor bank or money shop and use the proceeds to repay the debt. Any surplus shall be returned to the original paying bank or money shop, and any shortfall shall still be recovered from its other assets in accordance with the law. Article 14 stipulates that if a treasury bill holder encounters events such as loss or destruction of treasury bills, they should immediately notify the association and publish a statement in the newspaper. If no disputes arise within one month, they may provide collateral to the association or find a suitable guarantor to reissue the treasury bills.</p>
<p>Membership Fees are Shared Proportionally</p>
<p>Finally, the meeting discussed the method for sharing the association's expenses, which is 12 million yuan per month, to be shared by each member bank and money shop in proportion to the appraised value of the reserve assets paid. The method of payment shall be determined by the executive committee. The meeting adjourned at half-past five.</p>
<p>Furthermore, before the meeting yesterday, representatives of various member banks and money shops signed the covenant to express unanimous agreement with the provisions of the covenant and jointly guarantee it, which was submitted by the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Associations to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>The association's organization consists of seven executive committee members (see the first paragraph of this dispatch for the list). These seven members will elect three standing committee members, and then the three members will elect one chairman to attend meetings regularly and preside over the association's affairs. The candidates for standing committee members and chairman have yet to be determined at a future executive committee meeting. According to observations, Li Fusun will be elected as a standing committee member and chairman, and the other two standing committee members will be representatives from the national bank and the money trade. Although there were reports earlier that some national banks and bureaus did not intend to join the reserve association, it is possible that they will still consider joining due to the needs of the situation.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Gradually Stabilize, Oil Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>With successive arrivals of goods from various regions, the rice market sees stable prices for high-quality new japonica rice, while medium and lower grades fall by another thousand yuan. New indica rice from Xinbu, new japonica rice, new indica rice, and new sheep indica rice all experience price declines of a thousand yuan for medium and small grades. White yuan rice also shows less spirit. The North and South markets registered a total of over 7,000 piculs of incoming goods. Flour shops see brisk sales. Market conditions outside the market are firm. Millers slightly move on Min-style wheat. The Ningbo traders selectively acquire. Transactions for northern white wheat are sluggish, with prices weakening by 500-600 yuan. Soybean trade in Shantou is suspended, resulting in stagnation and few transactions, with prices falling by over a thousand yuan. Jute sees high prices for top-quality goods but stagnation for lower grades. Raw peanuts remain unchanged in the Chaozhou region, with prices falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Due to stagnation in Qingdao, new corn sees brisk prices of 500-1,000 yuan. High-quality broad beans rise by a thousand yuan, while medium grades remain stable, but lower-quality goods are relatively short in supply, with active trading. The oil market sees rising prices outside the market, with rumors of high prices in the Qingdao production area and insufficient allocation of oil for store sales, resulting in price increases of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake remains sluggish, with prices falling by 100-200 yuan. Wheat bran is in short supply, with prices rising by 300-400 yuan.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau, the China Edible Oil Company yesterday allocated approximately 2,000 piculs of raw oil to the bona fide members of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Association at a price of 88,000 yuan per dan, with 60 Group A households receiving 5 barrels each and 170 Group B households receiving 3 barrels each. Temporary orders were received yesterday, with payments due today and tomorrow, followed by staggered deliveries. Yesterday, Zhongzhi Oil Factory also allocated 350 piculs of raw rapeseed oil at 77,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Companies Shifting Registration to Hong Kong: 171 Firms in August</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 1st] According to Hong Kong government statistics, 171 Chinese companies moved their registration to Hong Kong in August. However, a government official told United Press that this number does not represent the total number of companies that have moved their companies and investments from China to Hong Kong. Some companies previously operating in Malaya have also moved to Hong Kong. The official pointed out that according to current Hong Kong law, companies recognized by the Hong Kong government are divided into three categories: (1) Hong Kong companies, which are only allowed to operate in Hong Kong; (2) Hong Kong-China companies, which are controlled by Hong Kong but have branches in China; and (3) Chinese companies, which are registered in China but can operate in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has expressed opposition to the second category, and the Hong Kong government may also abolish it in the near future.</p>
<h3>Fluctuating Government Bond Situation</h3>
<p>The government bond market is chaotic. The spot market once moved upward, dropping before rising again. However, with the extreme tightness of credit, high prices were difficult to sustain. The prices of various bonds fluctuated. Unified C bonds initially traded at 2230 yuan in the morning, rising to 2770 yuan midway, with remaining bonds being sold off. The price retreated to 2450 yuan at closing. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A, B, and E bonds remained flat, while C and D bonds rose by 100 yuan. The situation is volatile.</p>
<h3>New Longan and Dried Longan Arrive</h3>
<p>The first batches of new Taiwanese longan and Guangzhou dried longan have arrived in small quantities. The initial trading of new Taiwanese longan yesterday did not result in a transaction due to poor bids. Samples of inexpensive dried longan will be available for trading today.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Organizes Sugar Price Review Committee</h3>
<p>Adopting Price Negotiation and Increasing Supply</p>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau and Taiwan Sugar Corporation agreed to allocate sugar in installments at a stable price of 70,000 yuan per dan, the price of each installment has remained stable. However, the black market for foreign sugar is rampant. In order to eliminate the black market and correct abuses, the Social Affairs Bureau will adopt a price negotiation system for this installment and switch to unlimited allocation in order to increase supply and eliminate speculation. It is understood that the first Sugar Price Review Committee will be convened at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:00 p.m. today (the 3rd), and letters have been sent to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry Union, and the North-South Goods Industry Union, inviting each to send a representative to participate.</p>
<h3>Scarce Black Market Transactions, Lower Stock Bids</h3>
<p>Most Chinese stocks were closed yesterday. Only a very small number of dealers in the spot market had some transactions. Stock bids were lowered due to tight credit. The market was initially flat, but gradually weakened after opening. Less popular stocks remained balanced. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Mei Ya fell by about 5%, Jingfu and Xinguang fell slightly less than 5%, Qinxing remained flat, and smaller and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down slightly. Old established stocks remained stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were also slightly affected. The more popular stocks declined slightly. Yi Yarn and British Union gradually declined from 9700 yuan and 11000 yuan, respectively. Among the smaller stocks, Ruoye and Guang Steel remained stable. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Ruoye rose slightly, Steel remained flat, and Paper, Yi Ting, Asia, and Jardine Matheson suffered slight declines. Yi Yarn and British Union fell slightly more than 5%, and Xiangtai hovered around 14500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textiles and Construction Maintain Original Prices, Yarn Market Price Surge Has Been Somewhat Suppressed, While Grey Cloth Rises Due to Short Supply</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In the week before last, the yarn and cloth market saw rising prices due to foreign exchange fluctuations and positive sentiment. Furthermore, with the purchase from various groups and extreme scarcity of spot goods, the price surge was even more intense. Fortunately, the Textiles and Construction Corporation (Fangjian) maintained the original prices throughout, and private factories were able to cooperate with the authorities' will to suppress prices and jointly open goods, thereby curbing the rising trend somewhat. However, the amount of fine cloth opened by Fangjian on Saturday was limited, and the market price was 8,000 to 9,000 higher for those taking delivery. In general, practical manufacturers purchased actively because the autumn sales season had arrived, and since there was a lack of supply, brokers arbitrarily raised the prices. The market sentiment often sees the amount of goods opened by Fangjian as the standard for high and low prices. If a certain yarn or cloth is continuously opened by Fangjian, market sentiment will decline and prices will fall. If Fangjian does not open a certain yarn or cloth twice in a row, sentiment will rise and market prices will soar. Therefore, if Fangjian can supply as much as possible, prices will inevitably fall. In recent days, the purchase appetite of the Guangdong traders has gradually waned. Fangjian has tightened the restrictions on opening goods to non-practical factories. According to market sources, if private factories and Fangjian can continue to collect goods and cooperate effectively, the prices of yarn and cloth will definitely fall and not rise.</p>
<p>Another report says that the yarn market was firm at first but then softened yesterday. Buyers showed unyielding appetite, still choosing spot goods for allocation. Therefore, the prices of spot goods of all brands rose to 20,000-30,000 yuan in the morning. However, with the industry forced by tight credit, many dealers released their goods, causing prices to return to flat slightly. However, the foundation was particularly stable. Fangjian announced its prices as usual at 10:00 a.m., and both 20-count and 42-count yarns were opened. The price of Blue Phoenix remained unchanged. The former was 1.16 million and the latter was 1.9 million, both of which were market prices before the foreign exchange adjustment.</p>
<p>Although the cloth market continued to rise by 1,000-2,000 yuan, the price was still much lower than the previous day, and the momentum was somewhat flattened. However, due to rising prices in the foreign markets, sales gradually became active. In addition, since Fangjian did not have sufficient inventory, grey cloth was only maintained for dyeing factories and was not supplied to trading houses at all. Therefore, the price of grey cloth from private factories and small factories has been rising daily.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Gold and Currency Fall, Spot Red Once Fell Near 2 Million Mark</h3>
<p>Spot red continued to deteriorate yesterday, with pressure and short selling rising simultaneously. It was difficult to recover from fatigue. It opened at 2,065,000 in the morning. Supply exceeded demand. Although the pressure was not heavy, it was difficult to maintain due to unfavorable trends. It gradually declined from 2,070,000, but it was still relatively flat at first. Therefore, after 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank still allocated 201 pieces at a price of 2,055,000. After entering, the situation became more deserted. Those who needed short-term loans had to seek cash by short selling. As a result, at noon, it had fallen to the 2,000,000 mark. It gradually stabilized in the afternoon, and the next-day settlement rose to 2,030,000. As a result, it fell by 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Ornament gold was at 15,000, silver bullion and silver dollars were both flat. The implicit discount interest was generally very tight, and demand was not easy to come by. Interest rates ranged from 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao, and rose slightly in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also fell lower. In this environment, people have many views of going too low. From the morning opening sale price of 3,340 yuan, the currency repeatedly fell, and there was a slight struggle along the way around the 3,300 yuan mark. At noon, it dropped to below 3,270 yuan and settled down slightly. The gold market rose in the afternoon, but because the US dollar was for same-day settlement, it was taken up, but it was very limited. As a result, it fell by 70 yuan compared to last Saturday. The exchange rate against gold recently tightened to 613 yuan for ten taels. Finally, it was still strong at 620 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were looser than usual, with an initial price of 710 yuan and a lack of sustained demand, finally dropping to around 670 yuan. As a result, it fell by 25 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 680 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan. There was very little trading. There was no need for US dollar exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Although Credit is Tight, No Problems are Expected for the Festival Season, More Returned Checks Than Usual</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Bank, speaking to reporters, since the government adjusted the exchange rate, the Central Bank's gold, China Textile and Construction Company's yarn and cloth, Taiwan Sugar Company's sugar, and the municipal government's rice have all been sold in large quantities to meet the needs of the market in order to stabilize market prices. Therefore, the huge amounts of legal tender recovered successively are gathered in the Central Bank. At the same time, as it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commercial banks must release short-term loans, so there is inevitably a feeling of tightening. According to Li's speculation, the current tightening of short-term credit in the market may be even worse than the end of June. However, the financial community in this city takes the end of June as a lesson and is deeply cautious. Since the end of June, the lending and business management policies have become much more cautious. Therefore, although short-term credit is tight before the Mid-Autumn Festival, it will not cause panic.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Clearing House, the average amount of returned checks exchanged by the office is about 5 billion yuan per day. With the recent tightening of short-term credit in the market, the amount of returned checks has increased slightly, to about 8-9 billion yuan per day.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from Anhui Province</h3>
<p>— From Our Correspondent Fei Chaoran, Hefei, Gansu</p>
<p>The people of various counties in Anhui Province have been universally forced to "northernize southerners," changing from eating rice to eating noodles. After a short respite, they were also worried about the aftermath of the war. Fortunately, Heaven showed mercy and heavy rain poured down in due course. Without moving waterwheels, the crops in the upland and lowland fields grew vigorously, and the drought-resistant grains grew densely. The early rice has already been harvested, and the late rice is being harvested. Farmers did not have to work hard to cultivate the fields, and this year has actually been realized.</p>
<p>Double Harvest in Central and Southern Anhui</p>
<p>The counties in central Anhui were scorched by the high sun during the midsummer heat, with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees every day. The heat was unbearable! However, the rice seedlings received a wave of heat during the flowering period, and the grains were particularly large and abundant. Although they did not produce two ears per stalk, according to old farmers, it can be compared to the harvest of 1927. The rice ears in that year had 260 grains, and the current lowland rice also has this number, with plump grains, and even exceeding it. In other words, fields that used to yield ten shi of grain can yield twice as much this year. According to reliable information from various counties in southern Anhui, the harvest is comparable to that in central Anhui. In Wuhu, Wuwei, and other counties, the lowland fields along the Yangtze River are said to have two ears per stalk.</p>
<p>Busy Farming and Rising Prices of Rice and Grass</p>
<p>Many farmers in central Anhui are stepping up efforts to hire people to harvest, with daily wages reaching 5-6,000 yuan. They also have to prepare fish, meat, wine, and rice to entertain them diligently. Due to the full-scale mobilization of farming, the supply of rice straw has been cut off, so the price of new rice, which had fallen to 30,000 yuan per shi, has risen back to 40,000 yuan, and the price of burning grass, which had fallen to 4,000 yuan per dan, has risen back to 5,000 yuan. However, this is a temporary phenomenon during the harvest season. It is expected that when the osmanthus blooms, the price of rice will still fall to below 30,000 yuan, and the price of tall grass will also fall sharply.</p>
<p>Northern Anhui Counties Turn into Waterlands</p>
<p>The suffering and happiness are like heaven and abyss, and northern Anhui is the most extreme. The Huai River, Sha River, and Quan River have been flooded by the Yellow River water from the Huayuankou breach, leveling the embankments. The torrential rain that lasted for a month flooded the land to a depth of several feet, and there was no way to discharge the water. The rain also soaked the roots of the embankments, and there was no soil to dig, so how could they be rescued? As a result, the rivers collapsed one after another with a roar, and the sorghum, millet, miscellaneous grains, etc. in the fields were swept away by the water. Ying Shang, Huo Qiu, Fengtai, and Shou County, covering hundreds of miles, have become a vast waterland. People, livestock, and houses have floated into the Crystal Palace. Countless surviving victims, mostly old and young, went out to seek food, becoming refugees like Zheng Xia after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The price of wheat, the staple food in northern Anhui, has reached 100,000 yuan per shi (40 jin), how can the impoverished people bear this high pressure on their livelihoods? The Huang disaster relief committees in Ying Shang and other counties have been established recently, and they have reported the disaster to the province, asking for (1) exemption from military tax and public grain this year, (2) allocation of continuation grain from 1944 for relief on the spot, and (5) the relief sub-office to quickly abolish large-scale material relief. It is heard that the provincial government has approved the allocation of grain for relief, which is a short-term blessing for the victims, but it is still a drop in the bucket, and various parties still need to find other ways to provide widespread relief.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster in Fuyang Due to Levee Breach</p>
<p>I recently met a friend from Fuyang, who said that the Huang disaster in that county was even more severe than in other counties! The Ying River, Quan River, Hong River, and Qian River in the territory were all flooded by the Huang River water. The Yuehekou and the north bank of the Hong River collapsed one after another. In early July, there was heavy rain again, and the land was flooded with several feet of water. The crops in the fields were all drowned, and the loss of life and property was difficult to estimate! In the 104 townships in the county, 80 were affected. There are now hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are exposed to the elements, without clothes or food. They are emaciated and miserable, and deaths are occurring one after another. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic! In recent days, the United Provincial Association of Fellow Villagers has gone to the provincial government and the relief sub-office to appeal for the allocation of large amounts of material for relief and to ask the provincial council to raise a call to encourage donations from various counties to expand relief efforts.</p>
<p>Hail and Rain for Days, Sprouts in the Fields</p>
<p>What is lacking in central Anhui is that since the beginning of autumn, there has been a hailstorm almost every day. The heat has been swept away by the autumn wind, but the water in the upland and lowland fields will flood the rice ears, hindering the harvest. Sprouts have also grown in the fields. If the weather does not improve, the food at the door may suffer a major setback. Today (the 3rd), the black clouds disappeared and the red sun rose. The people everywhere are celebrating!</p>
<p>Representatives Call for Significant Reduction in Loans and Taxes</p>
<p>The total amount of loans and taxes for this autumn in the province was originally stipulated by the Ministry of Food, with each yuan of land tax requiring the borrowing of four dou, excluding the public grain at the provincial and county levels, totaling 8 million shi. Fortunately, the provincial council publicly recommended Gao Shouheng, who was old and virtuous, and Jin Weinong, who was enthusiastic about public welfare, to go to Beijing to represent the 30 million people of the province and make a desperate appeal to the central government. As a result, public opinion was accepted, and the specified amount was greatly reduced, changing it to borrow three and lend one, plus 30% for public grain at the provincial and county levels, totaling 5.39 million shi. Mr. Gao and others made a long journey in the humid summer to benefit the people, and their trip was not in vain.</p>
<p>Many People Reducing the Number of County Offices</p>
<p>The province originally had 51 county grain offices. Last month, the Ministry of Food eliminated counties with fewer taxes and determined that there would only be 31. The provincial office was very troubled by this matter! Because if they followed the order, the reorganization of the grain section would be hurried and would affect the entire collection. If they were to be temporarily preserved, where would the huge salaries and subsidies for the 20 offices be paid from? The provincial office is currently submitting a report to the Ministry of Food for approval. Director Yang Zhongming of the provincial office also went to Beijing on the 18th to argue for it. In addition, in order to adjust personnel and improve operations, the provincial office decided to replace the heads of 16 county offices, including Hefei. The candidates were chosen for their integrity and experience. It is heard that the number of people recommended by various parties reached over 200. There was a lot of competition for few positions, making it difficult to choose. The candidates for the county offices who have been announced are only 10 offices, including Hefei and Shexian, with only six offices remaining that are still competing. However, for the sake of the people of the province, it is hoped that they will break through the front as much as possible and carefully choose those with strict integrity to achieve the goal of enriching the country and benefiting the people.</p>

<h3>Family Economic System</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Chinese people have traditionally lacked a so-called "system" for family finances. Even privately owned businesses often make this mistake, resulting in no final accounts and no budgets. Consequently, there are often issues of excessive waste or financial strain in life. To remedy this problem, a family economic system should be established.</p>
<p>First, household accounts should be kept. The benefit of keeping accounts is not only that income and expenses are clear but also that examining expenditures helps one realize what is wasteful, what is necessary, and what can be saved. With a final account, a budget can also be made. This is the initial step toward a healthy family economy.</p>
<p>Second, live within your means. Unlike the government, which determines expenses first and then seeks to generate income to balance them, many people in Shanghai hold onto the attitude of "drink today, worry tomorrow" or the belief that "money spent will return." There are also those who are accustomed to speculation during the period of occupation, viewing making money as too easy and spending it all without a thought. However, now that the environment is different, they are experiencing financial difficulties due to past habits of extravagance. This is due to not establishing a family economic system.</p>
<p>Third, separate family and personal finances. Some people keep their money solely for themselves, with the wife unaware of her husband's monthly salary or how it is spent. She must ask her husband for money to buy groceries or daily necessities. Under the husband's sole control of finances, neither wife nor children have any room to manage their own finances. As a result, the wife may often inflate expenses to get some pocket money from her husband's allowance, while the husband may also deceive his wife in hopes of achieving savings. In reality, this is not the best approach. At the beginning of the month, in addition to budgeting for regular family expenses, the husband should also provide the wife and children with an appropriate amount of money, allowing them to independently allocate their spending. This not only allows for budgeting family expenses but also cultivates the children's knowledge of using money. As long as they do not use it for gambling or improper activities, it can also cultivate the wife's and daughters' self-esteem and autonomy. Being able to freely use money brings a sense of joy!</p>
<h3>How Should You Treat a Husband Who Comes Home Late at Night?</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Every virtuous housewife hopes to have a harmonious and sweet, fulfilling family. This is undeniable. But if, unfortunately, your husband comes home late at night, what will you do?</p>
<p>Generally, housewives often deal with them by arguing, questioning, and glaring. After they return, they don't let them sleep peacefully, forcing them to explain the reason for their lateness. After all, the reasons usually fall into two categories: normal social interactions or an affair where they spent time with a girlfriend's sweet words. The former is forgivable, while the latter must be rigorously questioned. This is the common understanding. In reality, the fault lies with them, but using this method to deal with them is not very clever.</p>
<p>First, we must understand that harmony and love between husband and wife are built entirely on genuine emotions, and the cultivation of emotions is based on mutual care and consideration. If one side speaks harshly and glares, then in the vital pre-condition of affectionate feelings between husband and wife, it is undoubtedly a failed strategy. The reason why housewives adopt such severe measures to deal with their husbands is to prevent them from engaging in inappropriate behavior outside and to bring them back to their former love. However, in reality, this not only will not achieve any effect but will increase their hatred and resentment, even leading to them not coming home at all!</p>
<p>Smart housewives, if unfortunately faced with this situation, will definitely use the greatest patience and deepest emotions to stop it. The pain and resentment hidden within her heart will never be revealed on her face or in her actions. The night is deep, and the earth is silent. Under the dim lone lamp, she leans alone on the head of the bed or sits on the sofa, mending her husband's clothes. The rhythmic ticking of the clock, cold and monotonous, strikes her sorrowful heart. However, she does not despair, does not become pessimistic, and is determined to wait for her husband's return! Finally, the door is gently pushed open, and the husband tiptoes in through the darkness. When he discovers that his wife is still leaning on the head of the bed at such a late hour, waiting for him to return home, he will surely be deeply moved by that affection. At this time, she should greet him with a weary smile, striving to suppress the resentment in her heart, and not ask a single word about the reason for his late return. Instead, she should gently and considerately ask him if he is tired, if he wants to eat some snacks, and tell him to go to sleep quickly because his health is important and he has to work tomorrow! Everything is as if nothing happened, and they peacefully lie down in bed together. At this moment, I can know that if this couple had a passionate love affair before marriage, the husband will repeatedly toss and turn, unable to fall asleep, because the gentle love, care, and generosity of the virtuous wife will deeply stir his heart, reminding him of that period of history filled with hardship, suffering, sweetness, and bitterness! He shouldn't be so ruthless. He shouldn't commit any more wrongdoings. He will feel ashamed and guilty! If one time cannot move his heart, I urge you to complete your wish with the greatest patience and with tears in your eyes. You will definitely succeed! If your husband is a humane person, he will not only abandon his evil thoughts but will also love and respect you doubly because of your kindness, deep affection, and consideration.</p>
<p>Have you seen the beautiful and moving film "The Great Waltz"? The gentle and virtuous Henriette, Johann Strauss's wife, used the most sincere emotions and patience to make her husband abandon the diva Karla and return to her embrace!</p>
<h3>Addenda to "Some Dietary Notes"</h3>
<p>— Bu Yun</p>
<p>In recent years, the progress of nutritional science has changed the general public's perception of food. Some research findings have even surprised the scientists themselves. Some, you might say, "What? I've always thought so!"</p>
<p>(1) Roast beef should be eaten rare, because the flavorful red juice is blood-nourishing.</p>
<p>That flavorful red juice has no special value. Eat your beef however you like, just don't burn it into charcoal.</p>
<p>(2) Sugar is the most energy-producing food.</p>
<p>Aside from salt and water, all common foods produce heat energy. This heat energy is measured in calories or "heat units." However, this heat energy has nothing to do with the so-called energy and endurance that ordinary people imagine. Sugar is merely like other simple carbohydrates: easily digestible and chemically, heat energy can quickly penetrate the blood to be used by the body.</p>
<p>(3) Fish is brain food.</p>
<p>Fish contains phosphorus, and brain tissue also contains phosphorus. The phosphorus in fish can reach brain tissue, as well as other phosphorus-containing parts of the human body such as nerve tissue and teeth, just like the phosphorus contained in milk, steak, and so on.</p>
<p>(4) Fried foods are the most difficult for the stomach to digest.</p>
<p>Careful research has not found evidence for this common view. Fat remains in the stomach for a longer time than other foods, but this does not mean it is indigestible. Fried eggs and boiled eggs are equally easy to digest. The fat contained in fried pancakes and fried dough twists is just as easily digested and absorbed as the same amount of fat cooked in other ways.</p>
<p>(5) It is dangerous to eat acidic foods and milk at the same time, because the acid will curdle the milk. Strawberries and milk, for example, should not be eaten together.</p>
<p>If you can eat the two foods separately, then you can also eat them mixed. If fruit acid cannot curdle milk, your stomach acid will still curdle the milk.</p>
<p>(6) Drinking large amounts of milk can prevent tooth decay.</p>
<p>Drinking large amounts of milk is beneficial, but most drinkers with existing cavities would deny this belief. Although milk is the largest source of calcium and phosphorus - the main minerals contained in teeth - some other elements are still needed to combine these two minerals into a complete tooth, and these elements may be missing in your diet.</p>
<p>(7) Do not eat rice and water at the same time.</p>
<p>Unless you swallow rice without chewing and with water. Water will not dilute the contents of your stomach. It flows out of the stomach in one go and is immediately absorbed by the large intestine.</p>
<p>(8) Wheat bread is more nutritious than white bread.</p>
<p>White bread is easier to digest. Made from cheese and refined flour, it is the main source of various minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, and heat energy. Whole wheat bread naturally contains many valuable elements originally in wheat grains and coarse fiber that aids excretion. However, coarse fiber is not very easily tolerated by sensitive digestive organs. Both types of bread are equally nutritious foods.</p>
<p>(9) The natural vitamins contained in food</p>
<p>are superior to artificially produced vitamins.</p>
<p>All known vitamins, whether in natural foods or in pills, have no chemical difference in composition. Although many foods may contain some unknown vitamins that have not yet been distinguished, plus other trace substances, which are therefore important for nutrition, artificial vitamins are indeed the best supplements.</p>
<h3>Small Family</h3>
<p>— Mo Ping</p>
<p>——Minimum Living Expenses——</p>
<p>Taking a family of a husband, a wife, and a child aged four or five as an example:</p>
<p>1.  Rent: A small room in a dilapidated building, monthly rent of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>2.  Rice: Each person consumes two *dou* of rice per month, with the child consuming half, so half a *shi* of rice is needed per month. The current price of rice is 60,000 yuan per month, so half a *shi* costs 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3.  Meat Money: Eat meat once a month, usually eat vegetarian dishes. The average daily cost of vegetables is 1,000 yuan (four pieces of tofu, one *jin* of winter melon, one *jin* of green vegetables).</p>
<p>4.  Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar: Limited to 5,000 yuan per month (5 *jin* of vegetable oil, 1 *jin* of salt, 2 *jin* of soy sauce, 300 yuan for vinegar).</p>
<p>5.  Coal Costs: Burning two *dan* of coal briquettes per month, 16,000 yuan, firewood for lighting the fire, 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>6.  Soap, Toothpaste: Valued at 2,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>7.  Toilet Paper: 1,000 yuan needed per month.</p>
<p>8.  Child's Snacks and Adult's Breakfast: A minimum of 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>9.  Newspaper: 150 yuan per copy, 4,500 yuan needed per month.</p>
<p>10. Stamps: 500 yuan per month.</p>
<p>11. Streetcar fare to the office: 7,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>12. Tea, Matches: One *liang* of tea costs 100 yuan per month. One box of matches every five days costs 100 yuan, so 600 yuan is needed per month.</p>
<p>13. In terms of spending money, let's use the lowest grade cigarette, priced at 200 yuan per pack, one pack every two days, already requires 3,000 yuan per month. Add unavoidable socializing and buying envelopes and other miscellaneous items. Estimated at 20,000 yuan per month, a total of 23,000 yuan.</p>
<p>14. Shirts, Leather Shoes, Towels, Socks, Children's Shoes, etc.: Limited to 300,000 yuan per year (this amount is only enough for each person to add two pieces of cloth clothing, two pairs of leather shoes, three pairs of children's shoes, five or six pairs of socks, and towels). An average of 25,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The total monthly expense is 200,600 yuan. This amount is truly the minimum living expenses for a small family of two and a half people per month. However, in the eyes of a small civil servant, it will probably still be a luxurious amount.</p>
<h3>Wife Needs Help</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>——One of Miss Dix's Mailboxes——</p>
<p>Dear Miss Dix:</p>
<p>Do you think I was wrong? To ask my husband for some help on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p>During the week, my husband only needs to work five days, and only eight hours each day, but every evening after returning, he just takes care of eating, reading the newspaper, and resting. On Sunday, he firmly refuses to give me any help, saying that this day is God's designated day of rest for him.</p>
<p>We already have a child who is just two months old, who needs constant care. So, in addition to doing housework and cooking all day long, I also have to take care of such a child, which makes me feel very tired. Therefore, I asked him to tidy up our house on Sunday, but he resolutely refused.</p>
<p>Afterward, he said that children do not need excessive care and hopes that I can also find a position and go out to work.</p>
<p>Am I wrong? Because I suspect that my husband no longer loves me! Manqi</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Manqi:</p>
<p>Clearly, your husband is a man who loves himself more. He neither considers the happiness of others nor gives comfort to others.</p>
<p>He may have a good heart to treat you, but perhaps it is only because you can be like a pair of good horses that endure hardship without complaint. So, this is not enough to make him reach out to help you.</p>
<p>Your husband only works five days, in other words, there are two full days of free time and only forty hours of work. What about you? Almost all-day work, no Sundays or holidays, like the famous poem says:</p>
<p>"Men finish their work, from sunrise to sunset; what about women? There is work that is never finished."</p>
<p>When you think of such an unbalanced work between a man and a woman, you must be surprised that women have endured it for so long, never wanting to put down their hands and go on strike to demand a shorter working time, so that men can also share some of the responsibilities of raising children for "motherhood"; if possible, wash the dishes or wipe the floor!</p>
<p>They will win, because everything in this world will stop advancing. If one day no one prepares food, raises children, tidies up the everything in the home.</p>
<p>But he is able to wash some bowls, or take the children out to play, so that within this hour. No more children come to cling to their mother's neck, and it is not a husband's supreme love for his wife:</p>
<p>However, a husband who truly loves his wife should think about how to reduce the burden of motherhood!</p>

<h3>The Merits, Demerits, and Rights and Wrongs of Jazz Music</h3>
<p>— Liang Youting</p>
<p>"Jazz Music" is translated into Chinese as "爵士音樂" [juéshì yīnyuè], which literally translates to "Duke Music." Looking at the characters, it seems very noble, but it is actually just a transliteration. The original meaning did not say: "This is the music of dukes." On the contrary, it was popular in South America before World War I, and it is said to be a creation of black people. To this day, black dance music is still authentic "jazz."</p>
<p>If we refer to Chinese popular and elegant music, "jazz" should belong to popular music. Its characteristics are lightness, liveliness, excitement, and stimulation, and it is full of carnal temptation. The music that Tolstoy opposed mainly refers to this kind of music. The emergence of this type of music is due to people's "excessively indulgent" enthusiasm. As for why jazz became jazz, it is because the structure of the music purely uses rapid rhythms, smooth melodies, and lively harmonies. It uses "syncopation" and obvious rhythms. Why do we say that it is full of carnal temptation? My personal explanation is as follows: A piece of music that can stimulate the listener's spirit is often music with a delicate melody, a not-too-rapid, not-too-obvious rhythm, deep emotion, and slightly melancholic in some places. It makes the mind immersed in certain thoughts or memories and aspirations. Conversely, a piece of music that makes people dance and expand their limbs, that excites the listener's body, must be music with a strong and obvious rhythm, and a fast tempo. Dance music and marches are examples of this. We are not saying that pieces with a fast tempo are not as good as pieces with a slow tempo, but if we specifically emphasize excessive excitement in terms of physical sensation, and make the music and dance of the time purely about sensory pleasures, then these arts lack artistic elements. Hume said, "The highest art is consistent with morality," which can also illustrate that music should not move toward "low-level indulgence."</p>
<p>Americans are too wealthy and particularly like jazz music. But the attacks on jazz are directly proportional to its popularity. I remember once an American radio station asked the famous conductor Itubi to conduct jazz music. Itubi hated it while conducting, and as a result, he stopped halfway and announced to the audience: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is not music, I can't do it, I can't hurt your hearing!"</p>
<p>Everywhere, we can hear the voice of condemning jazz music, but jazz music cannot be eliminated. To speak frankly, many famous musicians sometimes like to play jazz. The famous violinist Heifetz and the famous conductor Toscanini both play or conduct jazz. However, it should be pointed out that Chinese jazz is different from foreign jazz. The tricks of jazz also require skill. For example, expressing the sound of laughter in the Saxophone requires very high skill to achieve. According to Mr. Dai, the principal of the National Conservatory of Music, he heard the performance of jazz by local orthodox musicians in Vienna, and the skill was really admirable!</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai Music Association has invited Chinese and foreign musicians to discuss the issue of dance music in Shanghai. As a result, they did not reach a conclusion on jazz either. The level of the performers is too low, and everyone thinks it is simply a mishmash. As for the more acceptable jazz, they did not deny its advantage of being close to the masses, but in the current China, jazz is not needed. Their conclusion is: jazz can be "critically accepted."</p>
<p>The above rambling words are just to introduce a general overview of jazz. In terms of its merits, demerits, and rights and wrongs, I still cannot sympathize with it. As Mr. Chen Hong said, "Technique exists to express content. If the content is not good, what is the use of technique?" Therefore, although jazz technique is not entirely without merit, its essence is actually the same as the cookie-cutter and colorful song and dance films of America! As for the music in Shanghai dance halls, it is not even worthy of being called jazz!</p>
<h3>Small Thoughts While Watching Clouds</h3>
<p>— Che</p>
<p>Long confined to the desolate dryness of the desert, I thought of visiting the small bridges and flowing water of Jiangnan. But after a plane landed at Jiangwan Airport, I was plunged into the hustle and bustle of Shanghai, and almost a year passed in a hurry. I had almost forgotten that besides the cunning, streamlined cars and gaudy, makeup-smeared skyscrapers created by humans, there was also a world naturally crafted by heaven.</p>
<p>Only once, in a sleeping car on the Jinghu Railway, with the lights dim and the window curtains half-closed, did I see the lush green fields outside, sleeping heavily, deeply breathing in the breath of the summer night. The moonlight was like water, shining on the verdant plants, shining into the windows of the car, and I recalled many distant scenes like light veils, distant faces of friends like shadows... But soon I fell asleep in the fatigue of a day's journey.</p>
<p>Another time, in the film *Lassie Come Home*, immersed in the air conditioning of the theater, I watched the scenes of the forests in the Scottish grasslands, which were so familiar and so intimate. The sunlight through the dense leaves illuminated the forests so crystal clear, so exquisitely beautiful. Who would I ride horses and gallop with there... But when the show ended, I was back in the scorching sun.</p>
<p>This morning, I accidentally looked up from the window and saw the sky was so blue, with wisps of curly white clouds, floating charmingly like white sails. I suddenly felt that I had been separated from these for so long, so long. Had I not looked at the sky for a year?...</p>
<p>Being obsessed with wealth and fame can certainly turn Zhongnan Mountain into a bustling marketplace, but even being absorbed in work and career can gradually lead people to become mediocre. And can a mediocre person truly always focus on work and career without treating means as ends, pursuing fame and fortune? A difference of a hair's breadth is often wrong by a thousand miles.</p>
<p>Friends often wonder why I don't smoke or drink, but in the past, did I need to smoke or drink? In remote places, doing land reclamation work, there were enough dreams and interests in life. Why did I need tobacco and alcohol?</p>
<p>But in the future, I should "steal half a day of leisure" to learn about smoking and drinking. Perhaps the ethereal smoke rings will lead me to look up at the sky, giving me a glimmer of dreams; perhaps the rich and strong alcohol will make me leave the entangled real life, giving me a little lofty interest.</p>
<h3>### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 21</p>
<p>My mind was like a pot of boiling water, tumbling and churning, and I simply didn't know how to answer him.</p>
<p>"You lie here and don't move; otherwise, retreat into the mountains!" As he spoke, he was already gone, as swift and agile as a wildcat.</p>
<p>I felt my whole body trembling, unsure whether it was excitement or shame; the blood vessels all over my body seemed about to burst, my forehead and temples throbbed, and my heart seemed to float up. My throat felt like it was burning, and it was extremely dry.</p>
<p>With all my might, I saw Little Tiger leap onto the highway, aim at the truck, and after only a few steps, he raised his arm, and a bullet had already left the barrel, as if shooting at the truck. At the second shot, the light on top of the truck cab went out. After a while, the headlights also went out, and the highway was pitch black. Then I heard the sound of Mauser pistols on the truck answering the other side's rifles, one by one, seemingly rhythmic, but I never saw that _____.</p>
<p>From the wounded soldiers, I learned that they were soldiers under General Zhang Zizhong, guarding the area from Langfang to Zhimen; they had fought the Japanese devils several times. "They are all sneaky; they launch a sneak attack and then flee; each of our defense zones has no contact either. When the Japanese devils come, we just go up and block them. I heard that Commander-in-Chief Song (Zheyuan) doesn't want to fight, and our officers can't order us to fight either, so we can only get beaten!"</p>
<p>More than a dozen cart drivers were injured, not too severely. These nine military officers killed eight of the twenty-two wounded soldiers. I asked the cart drivers to go into the city with us. They _____ for a while and decided on a plan; those who were injured would pull their carts home on their own; those who were not injured would have to return to the front line, because there were simply not many stretcher bearers there...</p>
<p>"See you later!" The few who were not injured pulled up their carts and greeted me. In order to rescue those brave men who were guarding every inch of the motherland's land, this small line summoned up courage again, took firm steps, and hurried to the front line.</p>
<p>"Uncle!" After a while, the child ran back, his face covered in sweat; his clothes, a blue short-sleeved shirt, were also sticking to his body, and he was carrying a Mauser rifle, the latest German-style twelve-shot, probably used by the "Imperial Army".</p>
<p>"Can we go now?" He smiled, but also with some nervousness. The smile was to comfort me; the nervous expression was probably because he was afraid that something would go wrong again. As I started the truck, I briefly told him what had happened here.</p>
<p>"The generals just drive fast, don't worry about us, we can take the small roads home, don't be afraid--" The injured cart drivers pulled their carts, limping along, seeing that our truck was driving slowly, and they thought we were protecting them.</p>
<p>"Seven, not counting the cart driver--four locals, using the cart driver's Mauser pistols on this truck; chased three, using this long gun; and a few scattered and left--you know, I dare to see them, but they dare not see me!" He smiled playfully, while politely offering me a bite, and he himself ate the ______ cake he had squeezed out of his pocket.</p>
<h3>### A Storm (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Shi Qi</p>
<p>Wang Changfa walked into Zhengyanglou Chinese Restaurant, sat by the window, settled his buttocks on the stool, and slapped the table hard:</p>
<p>"Waiter!"</p>
<p>The waiter hurriedly ran over with an oilcloth over his shoulder?</p>
<p>"Sir, what do you want?..."</p>
<p>Wang Changfa glared at the waiter, his eyes rolling around, and suddenly stood up!</p>
<p>"Slap!" He slapped the waiter in the face:</p>
<p>"Damn it, you're doing business, and you don't even know the rules!"</p>
<p>The waiter's face was burning, he rolled his eyes, and threw the oilcloth behind him:</p>
<p>"Damn it, you hit, you hit someone..."</p>
<p>"Hit, I'll hit you, you bastard!"</p>
<p>Wang Changfa stood up suddenly, grabbed the waiter's ear, and slapped him on the face like he was fanning himself.</p>
<p>"Slap, slap, slap, slap!"</p>
<p>"I'll hit you, you bastard, I'll teach you a lesson!"</p>
<p>The accountant sitting at the desk pulled on the sleeve of the old _____ sitting next to him:</p>
<p>"Boss, Li Si is really unlucky this time. Why doesn't he have eyes? You dare to offend Wang Changfa, the famous secret agent of the Guandong Leased Territory?"</p>
<p>The boss stuck his tongue out for a long time but couldn't retract it.</p>
<p>"This is Wang Changfa, damn it, am I also unlucky? Sir, I beg you, go and persuade him!"</p>
<p>The accountant touched his head, stood up, and sat down again, looking at the boss.</p>
<p>The boss kept bowing:</p>
<p>"I beg you, sir, I'll treat you later, just take pity on me!"</p>
<p>Over there, Li Si was being beaten like a ball by his ear:</p>
<p>"Ouch, ouch, ouch..."</p>
<p>So pitiful. The accountant helplessly stood up, took two steps and combined them into three, and scurried over. He didn't dare to pull Wang Changfa, but gritted his teeth and slapped Li Si in the face.</p>
<p>"Your business is getting worse and worse. What did I teach you all day in the shop? This is Wang-Daya, we can't even invite him. Are you blind?" Then another kick:</p>
<p>"Get out, pack your bags and get lost!"</p>
<p>Then he quickly turned around, bowing repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Wang-Daya, you're a big man, don't be angry with a small man. This guy just came, he doesn't know the rules. You see, I was too negligent, I was only busy keeping accounts, I didn't see you come in, Wang-Daya..."</p>
<p>Another bow.</p>
<p>Wang Changfa finally let the accountant push him to sit on the stool, and said with a stern face:</p>
<p>"Boss, you know how to do business!"</p>
<p>The accountant bowed:</p>
<p>"Easy to say, Wang-Daya, doing business has rules!..."</p>
<p>Wang Changfa slapped the table:</p>
<p>"You also know the rules!" He pointed out the window:</p>
<p>On the ground outside the window, someone, after eating, couldn't digest it, and threw up all over the ground. The ground was covered with white rice grains, as if someone had spilled a bowl of white rice porridge there.</p>
<p>"Do you know that the Guandong Leased Territory strictly forbids Chinese people from eating white rice?"</p>
<p>The accountant's heart was beating non-stop, wondering which grandson had caused trouble here. Haven't we suffered enough from the Japanese devils in recent years?</p>
<p>While thinking in his stomach, he kept bowing.</p>
<p>"Answering your question, Wang-Daya, my shop would never dare to sell white rice, that's the rule. You, Wang-Daya, are always wise. I'll go check for you, check for you..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, his feet slipped, and he flew out like a plane....</p>
<p>There was a moment of chaos in the shop, the boss and the waiter all ran out....</p>
<p>After a long time, the accountant stumbled back in, put his mouth to Wang Changfa's ear, whispered for a long time, and then squatted down to offer his respects:</p>
<p>"Please, Wang-Daya, give me some face!"</p>
<p>Wang-Daya waved his hand and nodded:</p>
<p>"I'm going to catch the rice seller!"</p>
<p>The accountant immediately rushed over:</p>
<p>"Of course, of course, just beg you not to arrest the people who ate it. I'll have them take you there, and I guarantee you'll catch them!"</p>
<p>He beckoned to the door, and a person ran over like a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"Quick, pay your respects to Wang-Daya." That person respectfully offered his respects:</p>
<p>"Thank you, Wang-Daya, I'll take Wang-Daya there."</p>
<p>Wang-Daya glared at that person with his triangular eyes:</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Answering your question, Wang-Daya, my name is Xie En!"</p>
<p>"Xie En, you're not allowed to lie!"</p>
<p>Xie En then offered his respects again:</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare, Wang-Daya!"</p>
<p>Wang Changfa happily stood up and patted the accountant on the shoulder?</p>
<p>"Good kid, this is to your credit!"</p>
<p>He pointed his hand at Xie En:</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>Xie En walked respectfully in front, leading Wang Changfa out.</p>
<p>The accountant breathed a sigh of relief, sat down at the desk, and glared triumphantly at the boss:</p>
<p>"Finally got this demon out!"</p>
<p>The boss flattered:</p>
<p>"Thanks to you, sir, I'll be the host!" He raised his neck and shouted:</p>
<p>"Tell the kitchen to add four dishes for the sir, make them neat, and bring half a jin of white liquor!"</p>
<p>The accountant leaned his head against the wall, closed his eyes, and looked as excited as if he had already drunk half a jin of wine:</p>
<p>"This, this time, uh, lost some rice, uh..."</p>
<p>The boss sighed:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Liang is also quite pitiful,..."</p>
<p>The accountant shook his head:</p>
<p>"A real man, when doing things, must be ruthless..."</p>
<p>He didn't continue, because Xie En and Wang Changfa were already knocking on Sister-in-law Liang's door.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Liang, it's me, Xie En:"</p>
<p>Wang Changfa flashed to the side of the wall, the door opened with a creak, and Xie En darted in:</p>
<p>"Do you have rice, Sister-in-law Liang?"</p>
<p>"How much do you want? But the price has gone up!"</p>
<p>Wang Changfa suddenly burst out:</p>
<p>"Good, secretly selling white rice, the Japanese..."</p>
<p>He looked up, and in front of him was the face of a pretty woman, her round eyes staring. He almost fainted:</p>
<p>"It's you?"</p>
<p>An old woman came out from the inner room, looking very peaceful:</p>
<p>"Wang-Daya, this is the third wife's capital, you're arresting someone from your own family!"</p>
<p>That woman, the one called Sister-in-law Liang, stamped her small foot and threw herself into Wang Changfa's arms:</p>
<p>"You arrest, you arrest, you dare to arrest me, you must have been bewitched by some fox spirit. Tonight you can forget about getting on my bed!"</p>
<p>Wang Changfa stood there stunned, and suddenly seemed to wake up. He jumped over and slapped Xie En hard in the face:</p>
<p>"Get lost!"</p>

<h3>### Night Crying</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Returning home at midnight, bringing with me a body full of exhaustion, hoping for a peaceful sleep, but at this time, the cries of a child came from my neighbor's house. In the quiet of the night, it stood out in relief, making it difficult to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Rain of flowers, ghost night crying, are legendary omens of social misfortune. A child's night crying is just domestic unrest. However, in any case, it is an iron fact that parents have failed to take good care of their children, resulting in this unhealthy condition. However, fathers and brothers often go to the streets and walls to post such posters: "Heaven is bright, earth is bright, my family has a night crying boy, a gentleman walking by recites this once, and sleeps soundly until the sky is bright," instead of seeking medical treatment and medication. This ignorant behavior has sacrificed many precious little lives.</p>
<p>Children's physiological functions are fragile and cannot withstand the slightest invasion. In cases of discomfort, dissatisfaction, and pain, they can only express their pain by crying, which is very different from adults.</p>
<p>"A person who has not cried bitterly through the long night is not qualified to talk about life." The crying of adults is not limited to pain. The tragedy of a widow's night crying is not difficult for us to imagine.</p>
<p>Disappointments are often eight or nine out of ten, but only two or three can be told to others. If we wake up from a midnight dream and lie in bed thinking about everything during the day, I'm afraid there are very few people who don't want to cry. It's a pity that we can't be like a sick child, able to be uninhibited and emotional, often just crying silently!</p>
<h3>### The Fame of the Wright Brothers, Inventors of the Airplane</h3>
<p>— Fan Fu</p>
<p>"I am more concerned about world peace than the future of the aviation industry!" — Orville Wright said at his recent 75th birthday.</p>
<p>In 1871, two obscure figures were born in Ohio, USA: Wilbur Wright and his younger brother Orville Wright.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers were poor, and they tasted the bitterness of the world as children. Life forced them to think about ways to make a living. At the age of six or seven, the two brothers ran to waste and garbage piles all day, picking out bones and scrap copper from them and selling them to soap factories and second-hand shops to earn money. They entered school very late and only completed elementary school education. Later, they used the money they had saved frugally to open a small bicycle shop.</p>
<p>Dropping out of school halfway was originally a last resort. Whenever they had free time, the two brothers would definitely take out books and read. One day, Orville was reading in a public library and read the writings of the German scientist Lilienthal, describing his design for a kite-like glider and the theory of how it could rise into the air. This narrative and understanding aroused great interest in Orville. That night, he had several identical dreams in a row: he was sitting in a glider, which rose into the air, just like a sparrow.</p>
<p>After the two brothers' joint research and efforts, Orville's dream became a human miracle: at 10:35 on December 17, 1903, Orville climbed into that primitive plane. After untying the ropes, the engine emitted thick smoke and a heavy creaking sound, and then it rushed forward, rising into the air, lasting for twelve seconds, and then landing on the plain one hundred meters away. This was the process of the first airplane taking off in the world. At that time, Orville was only thirty-two years old.</p>
<p>After that, the Wright brothers devoted themselves to researching biplanes and finally succeeded. The two then traveled by air in the United States and overseas. In 1909, the French "Learned Society" presented the Wright brothers with an invention certificate. In 1915, the Wright brothers sold all the machinery and profits of the "Wright Airplane Company", which they had founded in their hometown of Dayton, but they served as technical consultants to the company. In the same year, the U.S. Department of the Navy hired the Wright brothers as consultants.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Orville Wright celebrated his 75th birthday in the United States. During his birthday, he said that he was more concerned about world peace than the future of the aviation industry. — Of course, he did not foresee that airplanes would be used as murderous weapons.</p>

<h3>### A Smile</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>Professor: Tell me, in any year, the number of tons of coal exported by the United States.</p>
<p>Student: In 1491 (Note: The year Columbus discovered the New World), the United States did not export a single ton of coal.</p>
<h3>### Proportion</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>I have a friend who teaches at × Elementary School. The subject he is in charge of is advanced arithmetic. The students have not been able to thoroughly understand the problem of proportion. So he used a simple analogy: "For example, in today's society, high-ranking officials make big money, and low-ranking officials make small money, which is called direct proportion. Also, for example, the busiest people earn the least money, and the most idle people earn the most money, which is called inverse proportion..."</p>
<h3>### Electron Microscope</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wenzhong</p>
<p>——Scientific Common Sense——</p>
<p>According to a TASS report from Leningrad last month, the 12th, an electron microscope that can magnify objects by 40,000 to 50,000 times has been completed here. The microscope was manufactured by the Red Guard Factory and is used for microbial research, etc. The term "electron microscope" may still be a term that we are not very familiar with, so I will briefly introduce the manufacturing principle of the microscope as follows:</p>
<p>It is found that the microscopes currently used in daily life are all composed of various convex and concave lenses. Using its curvature, objects can be magnified up to 2,000 times. In addition, a less common type of microscope uses ultraviolet rays that cannot be seen by the human eye to project images of objects onto photosensitive plates, and then develops them with chemical solutions. With this microscope, objects can be magnified up to 5,000 times.</p>
<p>The so-called "electron microscope" was originally invented in Germany, and the United States followed closely behind. Now Russia can also manufacture it itself. In terms of appearance, it is not very moving, just a tall, six-and-a-half-foot-high cylinder that can be placed on a table. The top is equipped with handles and pointers, and the inside is vacuumed to allow electrons to move freely. A thin tungsten wire is installed on the top of the cylinder. When current passes through, an electron current is generated. Different voltages are applied below the thin tungsten wire to increase the speed of the electron current flowing downward. Below is a magnetic field, which can bend the electron current and converge it into a focus. A fluorescent plate is installed on the focus, and the object to be magnified passes through the electron beam and is projected onto this plate for observation. Unfortunately, this type of light is harmful to living organisms, so it can only be captured as an image for observation. However, because light is not used for photography, it cannot be called an image. Scientists have given it another name: "Electron Display Image."</p>
<p>Under the electron microscope, we can see the true nature of various germs, and thus be able to further study the causes of the disease. Industrialists have used electron microscopes to improve cement manufacturing, and the mining industry is using electron microscopes to study minerals that are harmful to the health of miners. Chemists have seen the molecular composition of various elements under the electron microscope, which has created an amazing advancement in organic chemistry, resulting in the enjoyment of artificial glass, artificial silk, and artificial rubber.</p>
<p>Scientists have also told us that as long as a voltage of one million volts is applied, causing electrons to flow at 175,000 miles per second, we can see the unimaginable "atoms" that are smaller than molecules. Creating a million-volt voltage is not an impossible task, so the future of the electron microscope is just beginning. However, if we always wait and see or sit back and enjoy the results, we will always lag behind others!</p>
<h3>### Witnessing Strange Things</h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>On August 25th and 26th, the second batch of new students at × University took the entrance examination. Strange things happened in the examination hall, which were both funny and absurd, and rare in the history of the university. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>In the third class, when testing civics, the test questions were relatively new. A large number of ×× students, feeling that it was difficult to write, shouted from the heights by ×××: "Are today's test questions difficult or not?" Everyone said: "Difficult." Then he shouted: "Difficult! Everyone doesn't take the test, everyone goes to question who made these test questions." At that time, the crowd was in an uproar and left the examination hall one after another, and the order was greatly disturbed. The proctors were at a loss and stood there like wooden chickens. Seeing the overwhelming momentum, they fled with their heads in their arms.</p>
<p>A certain examiner, who did not wear the red ribbon with the words "Examiner" on it, walked proudly into the examination hall, but was asked by a certain examinee: "Who are you?" "Do you understand the rules of the examination hall?" "You are disrupting our order"... A long string of words made the examiner confused, with a flushed face and red ears, he hurriedly took out the ribbon from his pocket and put it on.</p>
<h3>Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (5)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Si Dao Shuai Zhuo Yu Qiang</p>
<p>This agent generously hired two British literary figures: one was a talkative Member of Parliament named Gill (Glll), whose pen name was Oscar Wilde; the other was a poor doctor from Portsmouth, Arthur Conan Doyle. Oscar Wilde engaged in lively conversation. The two happy writers immediately promised to write for Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Later, Wilde wrote "The Picture of Dorian Gray," while Doyle's work was "The Sign of Four." The text describes Holmes and Watson walking into the London fog together to investigate atrocities and murders.</p>
<p>The book was published as a standalone volume in the autumn of 1890 by Spencer Blackett. This edition is rare and difficult to find today. However, the royalty income was insufficient for the author's needs, and Conan Doyle continued to practice medicine in Southsea.</p>
<p>He was a humble man, and always a practicing doctor. When his profession did not provide enough income, he wrote novels. In the second half of 1890, he planned to happily combine his two professions.</p>
<p>He thought that if he became a specialist, he would have more free time to write and a large number of patients. Therefore, he decided to go to Vienna to study specialist medicine! The die was cast, and at the end of the year, Dr. Conan Doyle and his wife closed the door of Bush Villa. Today, a plaque bearing the name "Doyle House" hangs there, making it a place of interest for travelers. It can also be said to be the birthplace of Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>In the spring, he completed his studies in Vienna. A sign for an eye specialist was nailed to a door on Divan Street, marking the beginning of a new hardship. "Every morning," Conan Doyle later wrote, "I would leave my house on Montague Place and arrive at my clinic at ten o'clock, sitting there until three or four o'clock, never disturbed by the sound of the bell."</p>
<p>This was perfect for literary work. At that time, many best-selling monthly magazines began to appear on newsstands, including the famous Strand Magazine. While the smoking doctor in Eiderdown looked skeptical about serializing long novels in such magazines, a series of short stories with a single protagonist was very suitable. Fortunately, the protagonist was at hand. So, Dr. Conan Doyle, the eye specialist at 2 Divan Street, began writing his famous series of detective short stories while waiting for patients, which is now known worldwide as "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."</p>
<p>Now, Sherlock Holmes has firmly established himself in the world. The lean and strong figure has become as familiar a landmark as Nelson's Column and the Tower of London. The character has penetrated so deeply into the public consciousness that he lives more vividly in history than contemporary warriors and politicians. A phantom is so real, as Father Ronald Knox once happily revealed: one day someone in heaven will forget that he is just a character in a book.</p>

The Japanese surrender representatives were Yasuji Okamura, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in China, Ryosaburo Fukuda, Commander of the China Area Fleet, and Asasaburo Kobayashi, Chief of Staff of the Expeditionary Army, and six others. The hall was decorated in red, blue, and white, and was full of United Nations flags. There was a large "V" character arch at the gate, and the scene was quite magnificent. The ceremony was simple and solemn, lasting twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Kaifeng was liberated.</p>
<p>The enemy army in Korea signed the surrender, and Korea was finally liberated. Allied forces occupied Hokkaido.</p>
<p>September 12th, the Japanese army in Malaya, Sumatra, and Java surrendered to the Allied forces in Singapore.</p>
<h3>The Repatriation of Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War in the Year After Victory</h3>
<p>On August 15th of last year, Emperor Hirohito's surrender broadcast announced the final fate of the warmongers. The million-strong army of fierce soldiers, who had been in China for ten years, suddenly lowered their heads in dismay and became obedient prisoners. According to the surrender report from the China Theater and the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, the total number of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals was 2,138,353, including 1,255,000 Japanese soldiers, 784,974 Japanese nationals, 56,665 Korean nationals, and 41,714 Taiwanese.</p>
<p>On October 25th, the Chinese and American authorities held the first meeting on the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in Shanghai, which agreed on a plan for the repatriation of Japanese officers, soldiers, and nationals in the China Theater, allocated the work to be undertaken by both China and the United States, and stipulated the matters to be observed by Japanese soldiers and civilians returning home. According to the plan, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hainan Island, and northern Vietnam were designated as concentration points for Japanese prisoners of war, who would return to Japan by ship from twelve ports: Tanggu, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Sanya (both ports in Hainan Island), Haiphong, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. The inland transport was to be undertaken by our side, while the sea transport was to be assisted by the US military.</p>
<p>On January 5th of this year, the "China-US Joint Meeting on the Repatriation of Japanese" was held in Shanghai. The meeting pointed out that as of January 1, 1946, the number of Japanese awaiting repatriation in various places was:</p>
<p>(Location) (Number of People)</p>
<p>Taiwan 492,000</p>
<p>Haiphong 31,000</p>
<p>Haikou 30,850</p>
<p>Sanya 10,000</p>
<p>Lianyungang 114,850</p>
<p>Qingdao 102,800</p>
<p>Dagu 329,500</p>
<p>Northeast Provinces Approximately 2,000,000</p>
<p>Guangzhou 110,684</p>
<p>Guangzhou Bay (Xiying) 3,650</p>
<p>Shantou 6,400</p>
<p>Xiamen 10,700</p>
<p>Shanghai 759,250</p>
<p>According to the original intention of the US military, in terms of sea transport, it was planned to use 80 landing ships to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war, and it was expected that all of them could be transported by the end of January 1946. Later, after several consultations, it was decided to increase the number to 85, and one Liberty ship was added, as well as Japanese ships under US control, with the repatriation scheduled to be completed by the end of June this year.</p>
<p>In terms of inland transport, due to the lack of ships on the Yangtze River and the repeated destruction of railways by the Communist army, the waterway and land transportation were hindered, and the transport of Japanese prisoners of war could not be fully coordinated with the sea transport, so it exceeded the original deadline. However, generally speaking, the work was not very slow. According to an announcement by the US military in early July this year, after the last batch of Japanese nationals evacuated from Shanghai by ship, there would be no trace of Japanese in Central China. This last batch of Japanese nationals who evacuated totaled 1,350 people, and the number of Japanese who had previously evacuated had reached 800,000. In the provinces of North China, 550,000 Japanese have been evacuated, leaving only a very small number. As for the work of evacuating Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in South China, Taiwan, and northern Vietnam, most of it has also been completed.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war within the government-controlled area have already been evacuated. Regarding the Japanese in the Communist-controlled area, after negotiations between the US and the Chinese Communists, the two sides first reached an agreement, and finally the US forwarded a recommendation to the central government. On August 17th, government representative Li Xiujian, Chinese Communist representative Li Minran, and US representative Colonel Bell of the Military Mediation Department signed the Agreement on the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals in the Northeast, which came into effect on the same day. The agreement stipulated that, except for Japanese nationals in Lushun, Dalian, and Xinyicun, starting from August 20th, they would come to the National Army defense zone via the Songhua River, Lafa, and Duxi to transfer to Huludao for repatriation. At the same time, according to Sotoyama Niro, a Japanese national who returned from the Soviet Union to Fukuoka, he originally belonged to the motor vehicle unit of the Jiandao Garrison. In early October last year, he was sent to Posiet in the Soviet Union, and then sent to Sorsk in northern Siberia to work as a car laborer. His unit had 10,000 people, and there were 80,000 to 100,000 Kwantung Army soldiers in other ten concentration camps. From this, it can be seen that some of the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Northeast have been transported to Siberia to serve the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Regarding the requisition of technical personnel from among the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war to serve the Chinese government, since there was no explicit provision in the surrender document, there are currently 27,892 Japanese who have remained in China for service. The service period will be extended until the end of this year and will not be continued.</p>
<p>The repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war had to be carried out in batches due to the large number of people. The last batch of Japanese prisoners of war left Shanghai in mid-July of this year, while the last batch of Japanese in North China only boarded a ship in Tanggu on the morning of August 10th to return home. Generally speaking, the first to be repatriated were: (1) single men and women who could not support themselves, (2) undesirable elements, and (3) those who had legitimate reasons to apply for early return home and had been approved. The rest were separately stationed in "Japanese Unarmed Soldiers Concentration Camps" and "Japanese Nationals Management Offices," waiting for ships to return to Japan one after another. Taking only the Shanghai-Nanjing area as an example, there were as many as 19 concentration camps in Jiangwan, Wusong, Nanjing, and Suzhou.</p>
<p>In the concentration camp, the daily routine, meals, and entertainment of the Japanese prisoners of war were all scheduled. The Japanese prisoners of war's "staple food" was treated the same as that of our soldiers, and "non-staple food" and pocket money were issued separately. The Japanese nationals were given living expenses according to the local living standards. With regular life and stable living, although they were called prisoners of war, none of them were pale and thin.</p>
<p>According to the repatriation plan, in addition to the various rules to be observed when returning to their homeland, the items and luggage that each Japanese national and prisoner of war carried with them were limited to what they could carry on their own at one time. The cash they possessed could not exceed 1,000 Japanese yen for nationals and 500 or 200 Japanese yen for officers and soldiers. The reporter once witnessed a line of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war waiting for repatriation, each with a sad face and carrying luggage that they could not bear, and some even fell by the roadside in a disheveled state. The "favored sons of heaven" of the past ten years, once reduced to "dogs of a bereaved family," it is unknown whether they felt shame and anger in their hearts, or repentance?</p>
<p>For more than ten years, these Japanese have acted recklessly in our country, massacring and bullying tens of thousands of good and innocent compatriots. The blood debt and deep hatred have not yet been repaid. The magnanimity of the Chinese has allowed these "guilty of death" executioners to calmly and leisurely carry their neat luggage back home.</p>
<p>Every Japanese person who returns from China should forever remember! This kind of tolerance between nations is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both in China and abroad.</p>

<h3>Sixty Years of Japanese Aggression Against China: Eight Years of Arduous Resistance, A Century of Humiliation Washed Away in One Day</h3>
<p>— Special Compilation by This Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been deliberately seeking overseas expansion, and aggression against China is merely one aspect of its overall policy. This can be seen in the chapter "Japanese Colonial History" in the book "The Latest World Colonial History" written by the Japanese historian Okuma Yūko. He said, "If we regard the advanced countries of England, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal as colonial powers before the 19th century, then Japan is a colonial power after the 20th century. Japan's possession of overseas colonies began with the occupation of Taiwan after the Sino-Japanese War, so Japan's colonial history is only thirty years old, and therefore, its colonial talents are still somewhat immature. However, in the following ten years or so, Japan's colonial territories have increased every year, and its management methods have gradually improved, and it has become a strong colonial power in the world, on par with the great powers." These simple words of self-description exposed the ferocious face of the aggressor, and they were delighted that Japan had become a "strong colonial power," which shows the extent of their ambition.</p>
<p>The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan was in the ninth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty—the third year of the Meiji era in Japan. Japan sent Yanagihara Sakimitsu to China to present his credentials. At that time, China was being forced to sign unequal trade treaties with Western powers. Yanagihara's trip was clearly to gather information and plan to sign a treaty based on precedent, but he failed to do so. In May of the following year, Ōkura-kyō Idate Munemoto was appointed as the official envoy, and Yanagihara Sakimitsu as the deputy envoy, and together with Li Hongzhang, they negotiated and concluded a treaty of amity with eighteen articles, a trade regulation with thirty-three articles, and attached Sino-Japanese customs regulations. However, because these were not entirely the same as the treaties signed with Western countries, they were not satisfied and repeatedly requested revisions.</p>
<p>The Process of Annexing Ryukyu</p>
<p>The Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, the former being a dependency of China and the latter being Chinese territory, Japan, after the Meiji Restoration, had long harbored the intention to annex Ryukyu, which was close at hand. In November of the tenth year of Tongzhi, Ryukyu fishermen were caught in a hurricane and drifted to Taiwan, where they were killed by aborigines. In February of the following year, four residents of the Japanese Oda Prefecture were also killed in Taiwan. Japan then sent Foreign Minister Soejima to China to question this. At that time, the Zongli Yamen replied that the aborigines were uncivilized people outside the law. Japan then used this as an excuse to invade Taiwan. Through the mediation of British envoy Thomas Wade, a treaty was signed on September 22nd of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi. Although Taiwan was preserved, Ryukyu was de facto owned by Japan. In the fifth year of Guangxu, Japan changed Ryukyu to Okinawa Prefecture.</p>
<p>Korea and the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Korea was also a tributary state and had the deepest relationship with China. Japan repeatedly sent envoys to carry out activities there, but without success. In the first year of Guangxu, the Japanese warship Unyo sailed into the Korean coast and conducted surveys, resulting in a conflict known as the Ganghwa Island Incident. As a result, the Ganghwa Treaty was signed with Korea, in which Korea was recognized as an autonomous state, in order to seek further exclusive control. Later, Yi Haeung, the biological father of the Korean King Gojong, dissatisfied with Queen Min's dictatorship, attacked the palace at night and set fire to the Japanese legation, in what became known as the Imo Incident. Japan dispatched troops to rescue and signed the Chemulpo Treaty, and Japan stationed troops in Korea. At this time, the old and new factions in Korea were opposed to each other. The old faction was attached to China, and the new faction was pro-Japanese. The old and new factions attacked each other, causing the Gapsin Coup. Japan sent Itō Hirobumi, a court envoy, to China to sign the Treaty of Tianjin with Li Hongzhang. The two countries withdrew their troops stationed in Korea, and in the future, when something happened, both sides would notify each other before sending troops. In the twentieth year of Guangxu, the Japanese encouraged the Donghak Party to rebel in Korea. The Korean king requested troops from China. China and Japan both sent troops to Korea. After the rebellion was quelled, the Japanese cabinet strongly advocated interfering in Korean internal affairs, which China opposed. This led to the Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese army suffered defeats on both land and sea. On April 17th of the twenty-first year of Guangxu, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, recognizing Korea as a completely independent and autonomous country, ceding the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, and compensating war expenses of 200 million taels of silver. Later, due to the intervention of Russia, France, and Germany, the Liaodong Peninsula was able to be returned. Although Taiwan was ceded, the local people formed organizations to resist the Japanese army's landing for half a year.</p>
<p>Japan and the Eight-Nation Alliance</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu, Japan, citing the murder of secretary Sugiyama Akira by the troops of Dong Fuxiang, sent troops to occupy Xiamen. It also joined forces with the armies of Britain, France, and other countries to enter the Pingjin area, which was known as the "Eight-Nation Alliance." On September 8th of the following year, the Boxer Protocol was signed. China sent an envoy to Japan to apologize and pay a total indemnity of 450 million taels of silver, of which Japan received more than 34 million taels.</p>
<p>The Influence of the Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>Russia incurred the resentment of Japan by interfering in the return of the Liaodong Peninsula, and both countries at that time had intentions towards Northeast China. During the Boxer Rebellion, Russian troops forcibly occupied Manchuria and refused to withdraw, and the interests of the two sides conflicted. On the night of February 8th of the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Japanese army attacked the Russian fleet in Lushun, and the two countries declared war. Japan won and Russia was defeated. In addition to ceding the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan, the treaty also stipulated that Russia would transfer its rights and interests in Manchuria to Japan. China could not resist, so it concluded the Sino-Japanese Agreement on Manchuria in the thirty-first year of Guangxu. In addition to acknowledging that Russia had ceded all its rights and interests in Manchuria to Japan, it opened up many new trading ports. The Anfeng Railway was allowed to be continuously operated by the Japanese government. Japanese concessions were designated in Yingkou and Andong. Japan further demanded seventeen articles from China, including "China shall not build a railway parallel to the South Manchurian Railway," which we rejected. Japan even included it in the meeting minutes, later falsely claiming that it was a secret agreement.</p>
<p>As for Korea, in the second year of Xuantong, Resident-General Terauchi Masatake first seized its police power, replacing them with Japanese military police, and moved the Korean king to Tokyo. A Korean Governor-General's Office was established to govern, and Korea perished.</p>
<p>Extortion of Yuan Shikai</p>
<p>On April 8th of the second year of the Republic of China, the Chinese formal parliament was established, and various countries recognized it one after another. Japan even used tax reductions for Manchuria and Korea and the construction of five railway lines in Manchuria and Mongolia as exchange conditions, and Yuan Shikai recognized it before being formally elected president. Whenever the Japanese had an opportunity to take advantage of, they would not hesitate to use all kinds of means to extort and coerce, and their despicable shamelessness is evident in this.</p>
<p>The "Twenty-One Demands"</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic of China, the First World War broke out. Japan tried to prevent China from participating in the war, while it joined the Allied Powers itself. On August 23rd, under the pretext of declaring war on Germany, it sent troops to occupy Qingdao and the Jiaoji Railway, with the aim of not only inheriting Germany's rights in Shandong, but also occupying the entire Shandong Province. On January 7th of the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Yuan government requested Japan to withdraw its troops. Japan, on the 18th of the same month, directly presented twenty-one unreasonable demands to Yuan Shikai through the envoy Hioki Eki. They were divided into five groups: (1) to inherit and expand Germany's special rights in Shandong; (2) to expand military, political, and economic special rights and "land ownership rights" (later changed to commercial lease rights) in Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia; (3) to monopolize the Hanyeping Company; (4) China shall not lease coastal islands to other countries; (5) to hire Japanese as military, political, and financial advisors throughout the country, to jointly operate Sino-Japanese police forces, to connect the railways of Wuchang, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Chaozhou, and to have Japan build roads and mines in Fujian. Japan's ambition to annex China was exposed without reservation.</p>
<p>Japan presented the "Twenty-One Demands" to China, fearing intervention by other countries, and warned China to keep it strictly confidential. On the one hand, it tempted Yuan Shikai. On May 7th, Japan issued an ultimatum, giving Yuan Shikai forty-eight hours to reply. Yuan Shikai had no choice but to sign the "Shandong Treaty" and the "Manchuria-Mongolia Treaty" on May 9th. Except for the fourth group, which was announced by order, and the joint police operation in the fifth group, which Japan automatically withdrew, the others were agreed to by note. This is the "May Ninth National Humiliation," which the whole country resented.</p>
<p>Creating Internal Disorder in China</p>
<p>After Yuan Shikai's death, China's political forces formed two factions, the North and the South. The Japanese took the opportunity to win over and coerce politicians in the North, resulting in a situation of division between the North and the South in the sixth year of the Republic of China. The conflict lasted for two years and caused disasters in eight provinces. At that time, the Terauchi cabinet in Japan was in power. It provided financial support to the Northern warlords with the aim of prolonging the internal disorder in China. In total, from the sixth to the seventh year of the Republic of China, Japan lent nearly 500 million yuan to the Northern warlords, mostly through the hands of Japanese rogue Nishihara Kamezo, which was called the "Nishihara Loans." The warlords were able to engage in long-term civil war because of this. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the European war ended, and both sides declared a truce. In February of the eighth year, peace talks were held in Shanghai. However, due to the behind-the-scenes manipulation by the Japanese, no results were achieved.</p>
<p>The Japanese were cunning and deceitful. In September of the seventh year of the Republic of China, they lured the Northern government into establishing the "Sino-Japanese Joint Military Agreement for Preventing Enemies." On February 5th of the eighth year, they continued to sign the so-called "Sino-Japanese Military Agreement Extension Treaty." In addition, there were other secret agreements that were not published, with the aim of creating long-term internal strife in China, undermining our national strength, in order to gradually realize their policy of encroachment and annexation.</p>
<p>The Stirring of the Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the European war ended. In January of the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Allied Powers convened a peace conference in Paris. China was one of the participating countries, so it was able to send representatives to attend. At that time, it was believed that the "Paris Peace Conference" was the biggest turning point in international relations. The Chinese government and the public had deep expectations for the peace conference, hoping to remove all unequal shackles in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, Japan had already made secret agreements with various countries. Our representatives put forward the request to recover Qingdao and Germany's special rights and interests in Shandong. The Japanese representatives resolutely opposed it and insisted that the treaty of peace with Germany should clearly stipulate that all German rights in Shandong be unconditionally transferred to Japan. At the same time, they protested to the Beijing government, interfering with the speeches of our representatives at the peace conference. As a result, the Treaty of Versailles finally included a clause that transferred Germany's rights and interests in Shandong to Japan. Our representatives applied for reservation, but were rejected. When the news reached our country, it aroused widespread indignation among the people, resulting in the "May Fourth Movement" launched by the student circles in Peiping.</p>
<p>The Principles of the Washington Conference</p>
<p>In July of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the United States initiated the convening of the Pacific International Conference, which opened in Washington in November. Participants included England, the United States, China, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal. The themes discussed at the conference were one, limiting armaments, and two, the Far East issue—that is, the outstanding issues between China and Japan. American representative Elihu Root put forward four principles as the basis for solving the China issue, which were passed by the conference. The four principles were: (1) to respect the sovereignty and independence of China and the integrity of its territory and administration; (2) to give China a completely unimpeded opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and consolidated government; (3) to establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for all countries in China's business and industry; (4) not to take advantage of China's current situation to seek special rights that reduce the rights of the people of friendly countries, and not to reward actions that are detrimental to the safety of friendly countries.</p>
<p>As a result of the conference, Japan opposed both the two points of our country's tariff autonomy and the abolition of spheres of influence. The former proposed an alternative compromise, while the latter was shelved.</p>
<p>Our representative at the meeting had proposed two proposals to Japan, namely: to return the rights and interests in Shandong and to abolish the Sino-Japanese Treaty of the Twenty-One Demands. The Japanese representative initially refused to discuss it, but later, due to pressure from the United States and international pressure, he had to make some concessions. German industries in Shandong were returned to our country within six months, and Japanese troops and police in Shandong Province were also withdrawn within a time limit. In short, although the "Washington Conference" did not fully meet our country's expectations, it was like a head-on blow to the ambitious Japan.</p>
<p>The Occurrence of the May 30th Massacre</p>
<p>The Japanese had many yarn factories in Shanghai, and they treated the Chinese workers they employed very harshly. Unfair incidents were often heard. In May of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, workers elected representatives to petition the Japanese factory owners, demanding improved treatment. The Japanese factory manager suddenly opened fire and killed the worker Gu Zhenghong, and wounded several other representatives. The injured workers were instead detained by the Public Concession of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which aroused public outrage among the students. On May 30th, they launched a public memorial for Gu Zhenghong and gave demonstration speeches in the Public Concession. Western police interfered, arresting the speakers. Crowds followed to the front of the police station. Western police suddenly opened fire on the crowd, causing many deaths and injuries, resulting in a major tragedy. Tracing the root cause, the Japanese were the real culprits.</p>
<p>The Evolution of the Jinan Massacre</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, our National Revolutionary Army made smooth progress in the Northern Expedition, defeating the Zhilu Army, and occupied Jinan at the end of April. On May 1st and 2nd, the central government agencies arrived one after another. On the morning of the 3rd, because a Japanese person had a dispute with a Chinese soldier, a large group of Japanese soldiers suddenly fired on the Chinese barracks. Then, all the Japanese troops in Jinan were dispatched to attack our Revolutionary Army, resulting in the entire city being occupied. Many of our soldiers and civilians were massacred, and the death of Cai Gongshi, the special envoy of Shandong, was the most tragic. The Japanese were brutal and murdered diplomats, completely disregarding international law.</p>
<p>The main reason why the Japanese army created the "Jinan Massacre" at that time was to obstruct the unification of the National Revolution, and still wanted to maintain the remnants of the Northern warlords, creating a situation of disintegration in China, in order to divide and rule from it. However, our Revolutionary Army endured humiliation and carried heavy burdens, changed its marching route, and continued the Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident"</p>
<p>On September 18th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army suddenly attacked Shenyang with a large army. On the 20th, they pressed on to Jilin, pointing north to Heilongjiang and south to Jinzhou. Only in November did they encounter resistance from Ma Zhanshan and his troops at the Nenjiang Bridge. By the end of December, they had occupied all the important places in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>After the Northeast was lost, our government appealed to the "League of Nations." Japan advocated direct negotiations. The "League of Nations" twice advised Japan to withdraw its troops without result. On December 10th, the "League of Nations" established an investigation team, headed by Lord Lytton of the United Kingdom. On January 28th of the twenty-first year, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai attacked our 19th Route Army at night. The 19th Route Army and the 5th Army fought bravely, capturing many prisoners. The Japanese army reinforced three times, until March 1st, when they landed in Liuhe. Our army retreated to Nanxiang, but the bravery of our army and the enthusiasm of the people had gained even greater appreciation internationally.</p>
<p>In early March, the Japanese Doihara Kenji lured Puyi to Changchun and established "Manchukuo." At this time, the Lytton Investigation Team had just arrived in our country and immediately went north to investigate. On May 5th, with the mediation of England, France, and the United States, the "Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement" was established, one of which stated that "the Chinese army will remain stationed at its current location." At the end of September, the Lytton Report was sent to the League of Nations and announced on October 2nd. It recognized that the Japanese military action was unreasonable and suggested the establishment of a "special organization" to govern the Northeast, to replace the "Manchukuo" created by Japanese force. In February of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the League of Nations General Assembly announced a resolution: Japan would withdraw its troops, establish a system of autonomy in the three northeastern provinces, and a committee would be organized by the General Assembly to assist China and Japan in resolving outstanding issues. Japan brazenly rejected this, and in March of the same year, announced its withdrawal from the "League of Nations," no longer bound by it.</p>
<p>The "League of Nations" had no way to deal with it. The Japanese army advanced into Guannei (China proper). Yuguan was lost and Chengde fell. On May 21st, Tongzhou fell, and Peiping and Tianjin were in danger. Our government, despairing of foreign aid, decided that it was not the time for a decisive battle, so on May 31st, the "Tanggu Truce" was signed. There were no provisions for the puppet state of Manchukuo, but the areas in eastern Hebei were nominal at best. Japan had gained a base for attacking Hebei.</p>
<p>The Unfolding of the Full-Scale War of Resistance</p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Japan's aggression against our country did not slacken in the slightest. In addition to military aspects, continuing to advance on Suiyuan, in economic terms, it carried out armed smuggling in North China. On one hand, it funded secret agent activities, and at the same time launched a diplomatic offensive, sending Kawagoe Shigeru to China for negotiations. In January of that year, Hirota Koki announced the so-called "Three Principles," demanding autonomy for five provinces, Sino-Japanese navigation, correction of tax rates, and the employment of Japanese advisors, which was tantamount to placing our country's administration, economy, and commerce under its control. Negotiations yielded no results. In the summer of the same year, the Liangguang Incident occurred, and in December, the Xi'an Incident occurred. As a result, it promoted political unity in China, and the Chinese economy tended to stabilize due to the implementation of the fiat currency policy. In the twenty-sixth year, Kodama Kenji led an economic investigation team to China to conduct cooperation, which failed due to our failure. Economic cooperation in North China was also not resolved. At the same time, Japan's eagerness to plot against us was revealed in many special activities. On July 1st, the plot of Chinese traitors to riot in Peiping and Tianjin was arrested. Then, Japan became angry and on July 7th, launched a challenge at the Marco Polo Bridge. On August 13th, it sent troops to cause trouble in Shanghai, and a full-scale war of resistance was launched. Lasting for eight years, relying on close cooperation with our allies, the firm will of the military and civilians of the whole country, finally Japan succumbed and begged to surrender, and won the final victory, washing away the century of shame and humiliation.</p>

<h3>Stepping into Tokyo, the Capital of the Defeated Nation: A First Visit Report One Year After the Surrender</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Japan, Chuan Junyi</p>
<p>A year has passed in a flash since Japan's defeat. Japan formally surrendered to the United Nations on August 15th of last year, with Emperor Hirohito issuing an imperial rescript, and signed the instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri on September 3rd. I, the reporter, went abroad to Japan on the day after the first anniversary of the Emperor's issuance of the rescript.</p>
<p>On August 16th, at 7:30 AM, I, the reporter, departed from the Shanghai office of the Free China Delegation to Japan by car. After an hour and a half's drive, we arrived at Dajie, the base of the Air Force's 8th Group. Besides Group Leader Wu of the delegation, there were four other members traveling to Japan this time. After arriving at the airfield, each person underwent a thorough inquiry, and at 9:30 AM, we boarded the plane and took off. The pilot was Major Xing Yanfei, with co-pilot Feng Ruzhen, navigator Gu Weizheng, mechanic Gao Pengfei, and communicator Huang Bangjie also participating in the flight.</p>
<p>After flying over the ocean for three hours, we saw land and entered Japanese territory. Navigator Gu Weizheng, in order to allow us to pay our respects to the traces of the atomic bomb left in Hiroshima, specially altered the route, flying in a roundabout way and circling Hiroshima for a week. What we saw over Hiroshima was truly a scorched earth, the ground appearing yellowish-brown.</p>
<p>After the plane passed Mount Fuji, we arrived at Atsugi Airfield in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, around 4:00 PM. This airfield was completely beyond my expectations, not as clean or grand as the Chapo Airfield in Assam Province, India, which was built during the War of Resistance. The ground was paved entirely with steel plates. According to the Air Force personnel traveling with me, this type of construction was a temporary structure from a period of military occupation. After landing, Major Qian, sent by the delegation, took care of us, but we still had to complete entry procedures with the American personnel, such as getting vaccinations and smallpox inoculations. It wasn't until around 5:00 PM that we boarded a military vehicle and drove out of the airfield, beginning to experience the scenery of the Japanese countryside.</p>
<p>Near the airfield, there were no signs of the war. It wasn't until our car entered the city of Yokohama that we began to understand the scars left on the Japanese people by the war. Yokohama, before the war, was the gateway to Tokyo, a port for trade with foreign countries. But the Yokohama streets now, apart from the broken tiles and simple wooden houses built as temporary dwellings, had almost no tall buildings and no large stores could be seen. The Kawasaki industrial area had been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>After crossing the Tama River Bridge and entering Tokyo, we saw some houses that had survived from before the war. However, the streets of Tokyo had completely changed compared to ten years ago, being uneven and filthy. Every place was very unfamiliar to me; I almost forgot that I was driving in Tokyo. It wasn't until our car drove into the Chinese Delegation in Hiroo-cho, Azabu Ward, that I realized this was the Tokyo after the war, and I realized how great the changes the war had brought to the Japanese people were.</p>
<p>(1) Night Shops in Ginza</p>
<p>Before the war, Ginza was like Nanjing Road in Shanghai, the most lively and prosperous street. Before the war, in addition to all kinds of formal shops, every night there were all kinds of merchants lining the streets, setting up stalls to sell various items. But after the war, Ginza was very desolate. Several large department stores such as Matsuzakaya and Mitsukoshi had been bombed. The only remaining large building was the Hattori Clock Shop (watch store), but it had been converted into an American military consumer cooperative. The Western-style buildings along the street had all disappeared, replaced by small wooden shops. It was like Chongqing's Douyu Street after the "May Fourth" bombing, plus the street vendors along the road during the day, and that was the Ginza market after the war.</p>
<p>On these stalls, occasionally you could see American glass combs for sale, but not as rampant as the scalper market in Shanghai. This street was silent at night, with few pedestrians, only some soldiers chasing after "divine women" and the patrols of MP jeeps. The only relatively clean places were "Marunouchi" and in front of the Imperial Palace, almost none of which was within the sphere of influence of the Allied forces. Well-equipped, solidly built high-rise buildings had been requisitioned by the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Currently, three large-scale department stores—Takashimaya, Shirokiya, and Mitsukoshi—still remain and continue to operate in the Nihonbashi area. But they are far less luxuriously decorated than Sincere and Wing On in Shanghai. You can't find any imported goods. The items for sale are mostly crudely made, lacking the characteristics of the Japanese people before the war—small and exquisite. But the prices are twelve times higher than before the war, and the black market prices are more than a thousand times higher. A pair of leather shoes costs around 800 yuan on the black market, equivalent to 50-60 US dollars.</p>
<p>(3) Housing Shortage Too</p>
<p>Due to the damage from air raids during the war, and the influx of a large number of Allied forces (called "stationing forces" by the Japanese) after the war, the housing shortage is very serious. There are also situations similar to the payment of "transfer fees" in Shanghai. In the newspapers, you can see small advertisements offering "transfer fees" (called "right money" by the Japanese) to find housing. It is estimated that Japan currently lacks 4.2 million houses, plus the approximately 200,000 houses destroyed by wind, rain, and floods each year. If 600,000 houses are built each year, it will take ten years to complete. However, the government's current plan is to build only 200,000 houses each year, which is only enough to compensate for the natural rate of housing damage. Moreover, Japan lacks timber and must import it from abroad, but there is currently no hope of importing timber from abroad.</p>
<p>(4) Food Crisis</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender, some people predicted that a million people would starve to death within a year. Although the cabinet has been changed three times, they all feel helpless about the food problem. In June, there were more than twenty days when rice was not distributed in Tokyo and Yokohama. On May 19th, a crowd of 200,000 people held a demonstration march "demanding rice," carrying red flags and marching towards the Prime Minister's residence and the Imperial Palace. In view of this, the Allied forces specially imported food and distributed it to the Japanese people, a total of five times. The first time was on May 20th, for 5.2 days' worth; the second time was on June 11th, for 5.9 days' worth; the third time was on June 22nd, for 13.4 days' worth; the fourth time was on July 2nd, for 10 days' worth; and the fifth time was on July 13th, for 7.5 days' worth of flour and 6.2 days' worth of canned goods. From the first time on May 20th to the fifth time on July 27th, for a period of 69 days, 70% of the food was distributed by the Allied forces. In August, the Allied forces imported a large amount of rice and distributed it to the Japanese people. The estimated rice harvest this year is 55 million shi, 16 million shi more than last year's actual harvest of 39 million shi. This is because the Japanese people have benefited particularly from favorable weather this year, but there is still a shortage of fertilizer, so the Japanese people are truly relying on the heavens for their food.</p>
<p>(5) The Flood of New Yen</p>
<p>After the Japanese government surrendered, in order to curb the expansion of the yen, it announced the "Financial Emergency Measures Order" in February, and the Bank of Japan issued a new type of banknote called the "New Yen," ordering the Japanese people to exchange the old "Yen" for the new "Yen." However, this measure has not been effective. In early May, the issuance of the New Yen broke through 30 billion, and by August 1st, it had broken through 50 billion yen. If this situation continues, by the end of this year, it will not be far from the currency inflation situation in China and Hungary.</p>
<p>(6) Extremely Serious Unemployment</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, all industrial activities came to a standstill, and labor power naturally could not be digested. In economic terms, the reconstruction of industry depends heavily on labor power, but the current situation in Japan is that the digestion of labor power depends on the recovery of industry. According to Mr. Kawai Atsushi, there are an estimated 2.5 million unemployed people in general. If you add black market merchants, other latent unemployed people, and Japanese people repatriated from abroad, the total number of unemployed people will reach 5 million. In the second half of this year, after the Japanese government stops subsidizing industries related to military demand, various industries will have to reorganize, and after the reparations issue is resolved, some industrial equipment will have to be withdrawn from Japan, so 100,000 people will have to become a reserve army of industry—the unemployed. These days, the workers of the state-run railway are brewing over the issue of layoffs, which shows the seriousness of the unemployment problem in general.</p>

<p>United Nations Victory Day Commemorative Pictorial</p>
<p>On September 3rd of last year, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu led the Japanese surrender delegation to the American battleship Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay, to sign the formal surrender agreement.</p>
<p>Imperial Japanese Chief of Staff Yoshijirō Umezu, representing the Imperial Japanese General Headquarters, signed the Japanese surrender agreement.</p>
<p>Yoshijirō Umezu, Chief of the Imperial Japanese General Staff, who participated in the signing of the Japanese general surrender, presented his identification documents to the American side.</p>
<p>The signing ceremony of the Japanese surrender in the Chinese military region was held on September 9th of last year at the Headquarters of the Chinese Army in Nanjing. General Yasuji Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army, signed and stamped the instrument of surrender, and Commander-in-Chief Tian He presided over the surrender.</p>
<p>During the signing ceremony of the Japanese surrender in the Chinese theater, Kobayashi, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, handed over two copies of the instrument of surrender signed and stamped by General Yasuji Okamura to Commander-in-Chief He.</p>
<p>The National Army's airborne troops entered the capital's bustling streets, with the people pouring into the streets to welcome them.</p>
<p>The surrendered Japanese troops from various places gathered in Nanjing to be sent back to their country.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender, the National Army rushed to various areas occupied by the Japanese army. The picture shows the army arriving near Yichang</p>
<p>Last year, after the Japanese army surrendered, batches of troops from our New Sixth Army were airlifted to Beijing to take over defense and Japanese disarmament matters.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army surrendered, they surrendered their weapons and were concentrated at various ports, where they were sent back to their country in batches by ship.</p>
<p>Japanese residents in various parts of our country were concentrated at various ports and then sent back to their country in batches.</p>
