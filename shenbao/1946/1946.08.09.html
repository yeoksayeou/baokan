<h3>馬帥返京加強談判　即將約晤國共雙方代表　實施舊方案和平可實現</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺八日電〕馬歇爾元帥於今日中午十二時卅分偕夫人至主席行轅，向蔣主席辭行，主席夫婦留馬帥夫婦同進午餐，並談一小時半，馬帥返行館後，於下午三時二十分陣雨初晴，淸麗如畫之湖光山色中，乘轎離牯，由潯搭機飛京。聞馬帥臨行時笑語其夫人曰：「下週再來」。據悉：馬歇爾元帥此次返京，將以最大努力，就整軍停戰一課題，賡續與共產黨商談，關於一般性之政治問題，現正由司徒大使負責，與各方研究商洽中。外傳司徒大使此次返京係洽商改組政府一事，絕對不確，因在整軍復員兩事未完成前，一時尙談不到改組政府，或擴大政府基礎，蓋國民政府爲貫澈其救國建國之大計，必須將未來之新政府建築於和平統一有完整秩序之基礎上也。據可靠方面消息，馬帥於上星期六三登廬山，與蔣主席晤談後，對主席始終主張以政治方式解決國內糾紛之苦心，有進一步之認識，對於中國政府力持必須實行整軍方案，從速恢復交通，以安定社會秩序，完成復員大計之願望，亦有同感，馬帥此次返京，仍將就其過去寳貴之經騐，賡續爲中國和平而努力，惟馬帥此次帶往南京者，其行篋中除已增加若千新資料，如安平事件等之報告外，僅若干可能提出覆閱之舊方案，並無新方案，因解決中國目前之爭端，祇須將過去曾經共產黨同意簽字之舊方案一一推誠實行，和平即可實現，否則任何一人，均難預言中國未來之局勢，將演變至任何境地也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕馬歇爾特使於今晚七時半大雨滂沱中返京，馬帥以六五高齡，僕僕京牯，自不勝重勞，故馬帥下機後，即逕赴行館休息，聞明日上午司徒大使即將與馬帥會見，商談關於安平事件及國共間之和平談判等問題，消息靈通人士咸信馬氏與司徒雷登大使晤會後，即將邀晤政府及共黨代表舉行談判。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺八日電〕馬歇爾元帥繼司徒雷登大使下山，顯係就大使在京爲賡續和平商談所作之初步接洽，加强其進度，並與共產黨談判安平事件。觀察家認爲依據陳總長昨在牯嶺記者招待會談話餍續和平商談，仍應以蔣主席於本年六月間先後所頒停戰廿三天命令中急須切實解決之四項主題爲範圍，此四項主題，即停戰，整軍，恢復交通與商決共軍地區是也，共產黨對此四項主題，能有具體事實表現，其他可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>司徒大使接見曾琦</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕司徒大使今竟日未出，除接見來訪之荷蘭駐華公使外，並有軍事參議院院長龍雲，青年黨領袖曾琦及該黨中常委劉東岩，曾先後往訪。龍氏係一普通之拜會，泛論一般問題；曾氏則就靑年黨之政策黨綱等，作詳盡之說明，對國是提出主張，就敎於司徒大使。晚間司徒並約前美國大使館參事施麥斯夫婦晚餐。今晚美使館一帶停電，大使即於燭光下與史氏夜談，曾涉及中國問題及安平事件。記者往訪時，大使正待登棋休息，與記者略作片刻之談話後，親持燭送至門首。據悉：大使目前仍在等待美國國內之輿論，最近紐約一報章曾論及安平事件，該報認爲共黨欲以安平事件爲手段，而達成其美軍撤退之目的，則完全爲一錯誤之方式云云。此項論調在美頗爲普遍，足以說明美國之興論一般態度。大使正尋公正途徑，務求和平談判之不中斷，同時絕不使安平事件有影響和平之談判。有人謂安平事件之責任，共產黨自不能辭其咎，然至目前爲止，共產黨迄未有承認錯誤之表示，故有人認爲馬帥返京後，將以此事向周氏求得確切之答覆。</p>
<h3>安平事件開始調查　軍調部特別小組一度出發　該區國共軍衝突另行調處</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕軍調部美方委員饒伯森提議，三方各派遣記者二人，隨同第廿五小組調查安平事件，政府方面業指定中央社記者趙孝章及本報記者張劍梅參加。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平八日電〕担任調査美軍被　擊案之軍調部特別小組，八日下午二時牛，分乘汽車五輛，高揭白旗，馳往出事地點，實地調査。此次調査之開始，適在該案發生以後第十天。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約七日合衆電〕美國雷諾爾斯金屬公司，宴請何應欽將軍，商震將軍及張平羣氏等，席間要求派遣代表前往中國請求中國政府合作，俾使在中國建立大規模製鋁工業。渠稱：貴國有鐵礬土與人力，但缺乏工業，而吾人有技術與資金，協助諸君完成諸君所需要者。商震代表蔣主席接受該公司所獻之蔣主席鋁製像，商將軍允許即可寄往南京，以爲美國對中國友誼之象微。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕聯總方面稱：賴伽第亞署長將視察華沙（波蘭京城）布拉格（捷克京城），十月九日左右可抵中國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日內瓦七日電〕賴氏向聯總第四屆理事會義提出最近一季報告書，作此呼應，並稱：聯總歐洲接濟計劃，將於十月三十一日結束，東方部份則將於明年三月三十一日結束，但接濟品之前運送，將繼續進行至各該日期之後，余將前往中國以視究竟。</p>

<p>〔中央社日內瓦七日合衆電〕美副國務卿克萊頓告聯總第五次行政會議稱：美國已不再向聯總貢獻捐款，各國目前必須設法重謀世界之貿易，而不再依賴救濟。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯總遠東區代表特別會議定明（十日）晨十時在此間上海銀行大廈舉行，仍由蔣署長廷鄰任主席，中·美·英·蘇·法·印·奧·荷·紐西蘭等國代表均將出度，其主要議題，厥爲檢討聯總遠東區之工作。</p>
<h3>運華物資儘速恢復</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社日內瓦七日電〕聯總署長賴伽第亞，頃向聯總第五次全體大會報告時，對於聯總未能以足够糧食運往中國一事，表示歉意。並調：中國亟需救濟，惜以該國運輸工具缺乏，欲將價值五萬三千五百萬美元之物資分配各地，殊屬十分困難。余與副署長賈克繼力謀改善駐華代表團，幸得美軍艾格登少將出任中國分署署長，惟本年六月份中國交通情形頗爲惡劣，致使物資堆積港口，局部損壞，以是遂令除糧食一項而外，其餘一切物資停止運華，此舉非完全停止供給或减少援華物資之謂。六月卄二日，在中國港口舶有貨船四十二艘，等待卸貨，預料至九月份，情形將見改善，屆時貨運當儘量恢復。余昨與中國代表團團長會晤，頗爲滿意，余確信中國政府完全諒解，並竭誠合作。聯總僅係暫時組織，一九四七年度經費尙未編製預算，至聯總停工作之後，聯合國糧食及農業組織，將負責分配糧食，深望國際復興銀行，將以低息貸款與戰災各國，得以從事復興工業。</p>
<h3>「時間」即「物資」　行總希望延長工作時限　改善物資分配正討論中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總署長賴伽第亞氏主張該署結束時間不予延緩後，記者特謁行總蔣署長，詢問此舉對行總可能發生何等影響，蔣氏答稱：行總之任務，原爲處理聯總糧華之物資，並將此項物資運輸至需用地點。聯總結束後，行總自亦將結束，惟時間上因尙須運輸此最後一批物資之故，行總之結束或須較遲，惟至多不逾三個月，必可將此項物資運畢。聯總結束日期，本定本年年底，而行總亦本定於明年三月三十一日結束，惟我國幅員遼闊，運輸極不便利，內地若干地區，竟須一面築路，一面運輸，而海口之吞吐　又極有限。即以我國最大之海口而言，港口已九年未加流濬，因而吞吐量又較載前减少百分之四十，我人旣盤「魔術」能使此海口放大，惟有希望時間港够延長。前次聯總遠東區大會時，曾通過向聯總大會建議，將有總工作時間延至明年六月三十日，屬時是否再予延期之必要，亦可傷時再加考慮。而當時我國之要求，則爲希望行總工作期限能延至明年九月三十日，即在此次聯總大會之中，我國之要求，仍復如此，因余深知以中國之善後救濟而論，「時間」寰即「物資」也。又行總東北分署組織五個寰騐隊，在東北各鼠疫流行區研究防疫辦法。</p>

<p>對於最近東局勢之發展，鄭氏認爲不久即可恢復秩序，進一步當能促進世界和平之實現。鄭氏關稱：「德日投降後，各國均感戰災慘重，方謀復員復興之不暇，自無意且亦不敢再當試第三次大戰之禍焰，因此，在今後二十年內，吾人實敢斷言，世界各國，必不致再見戰爭。」</p>
<p>最後，記者詢渠由澳返國後之觀感，渠稱：國內現狀之不安定，實八年抗戰結束後，應有之趨勢，老子云：「大兵之後，必有凶年」。吾人了解此點，與可心平氣和；對於國共談判問題，鄭氏認爲關鍵全在中國共產黨有無誠意，同時更希望美蘇政治家對其一切宣傳，有一清楚瞭解，勿受其欺。鄭氏并稱：「余對國內政治現狀，有三不解：（一）國共談判截至現在止，所爭執者仍爲地盤問題，我國在如此百廢待舉之狀態下，國內竟無一黨一派提出有關改善全國人民生活現狀之主張；（二）無黨無派在我國也能成爲一種集團，形成一種力量；（三）共產黨基本主張在實行無產階級專政，竟自認爲民主政黨，以輿論自由而論，延安報紙如能隨便批評中共領袖毛澤東之一切行論，吾人實不敢置信」。鄭氏末稱：「在今日世界中：任何一國，必需外應國際潮流，內順團內環境，才能建立不拔，自力更生的基礎，我國爲世界中之一環，自亦不能例外」。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>調整待遇與政治革新</h3>
<p>國防最高委員會前天開會，通過了公務員待遇再度整一案，自八月份起，即開始實行，京滬基本數增加爲十一萬元，加成數亦改爲七百二十倍。依此計算，委任官的薪俸，將在二十萬左右，薦任官的薪俸，將達三十萬元。政府在財政萬分拮據的時候，突然自動並提早調整公務人員的待遇，不能不說是目前政治上最可喜的好現象，值得我們的重視。</p>
<p>本報對於公務人員的待遇菲薄，素表同情；但鑒於國家財政收支的情形，又不得不贊成政府逐漸調整的辦法，如果不顧一切，將公務員待遇大大的提高，而在財政上又毫無別的辦法，唯有以增加法幣的發行額一法，來彌補這增加的支出，則通貨更加要膨脹，物價也要接踵而起，狂跳飛漲，不僅公務員的生活，仍無改善希望，反而引起風潮，造成金融財政的紊亂現象。所以調整公務員待遇，不能不顧及目前財政收支的情形。但今番政提高公務員待遇，平均增加百分之五十，以全國的公務人員的總額來計算，爲數可觀。是否影響及國家財政與物價？當爲國人最關切的問題。據宋行政院長談稱：「國庫情形良好，本年七月份內，法幣發行額，並未增加，此次調整，不致影響國家財政」。同時彭宣傳部長也說：「近來除輸人品普遍跌價之外，以秋季豐收關係，各省糧價，已普遍下跌，故提高待遇，不致影響物價」。由此可知，我國財政已臻於分健全，調整待遇不致增加通貨膨脹，也不會刺激物價上漲，所以今後公務人員的生活，確實有改善的希望了。</p>
<p>「衣食足然後知榮辱」，公務人員的生活安定之後，自能安心工作，不僅可以提高行政效率，而且貪汚之風，也可因此戢止，所以我們對於這次調整待遇，誠可視政治革新的起點。談起中國今日的政治，莫不以國共的積不相容爲目下時局的僵局，其產黨的企圖以武力解決政爭，爭城奪地，割據稱雄，固爲國內戰亂的一切根源，但在政府方面也應該深切反省，其產黨素以燒殺淫掠爲其「革命手段」，早爲國人所共棄，但十年來爲什麼它的勢力未見削弱反而日見膨脹呢？戰略上有所謂「知己知彼百戰百勝」，在政爭上更要「知己知彼」，否則就不能擊敗政敵。不容諱言，要民對於當前政治腐敗情形，因爲身歷其境的緣故，莫不痛心疾首，期待政府改革政治的迫切，僅以「喁喁望治」的一句成語，猶恐不能形容易其萬一。因爲人民不滿意現狀，往往容易受野心家的利用，今日共產黨勢力膨脹的原因，也就在此，是值得我國當局反躬自省的。</p>
<p>今日政治的通弊，不外乎兩端：第一是執政者的低能，不論在中央或地方行政機關，上至主管長官，下至科員辦事員，很少有幹練的人才，根本談不上什麼行政效率，辦一件公事，只見公文在那裏兜圈子，不知到那一天可以批示出來。這固然是中國官塲的積習，但是今日之中國，遠非昔比，決不能聽其自然，而不設法改善。第二是貪汚之風的盛行，抗戰期間的政風如何？不必再說；以目下政界的情形而論，幾乎「無官不貪」。已經乎無日無之，例如昨日本報訊漢口市直接稅局的一個稽徵員貪汚，竟達一萬萬元，這種貪汚案件的層出不窮，不僅要引起人民對於政府的惡感，而且也有失去國有的體面。革新政治，當非先從整頓政我做起不可，而轉移政風，尤非以提介廉潔不可。中國有一句俗語：「武人不怕死，文人不要錢」，雖已陳腐不堪，但在貪汚之風盛極一時的今日，還有提倡的價值。</p>
<p>在公務員待遇未調整之前，我們雖然早欲提出這個問題來檢討，但是格於一般人的觀念，不是說：「待遇菲薄，旣不能安心工作，還談什麼行政效率？」，就是說「奉公守法，不收非份之財，教窮公務員如何活下去？」我們也不能希望人人都是做聖賢豪傑；均能舍已爲羣。現在待遇調整了，固不能說如何優渥豐厚，但對於他們的基本生活，不無小補；政府在財政萬分拮据的時候，猶欲調整公務員的待遇，如果他們仍不能體諒政府的苦心，不知增加行政效率，杜絕貪汚的風氣，那末怎樣對得起國家！又怎樣對得起人民！</p>
<p>要之，目下的政局，雖如這幾天的敢候，令人煩悶；但是我們相信，前途是光明的，所謂事在人爲。何況武力是解決不了問題的，國共之間的政爭，站在人民的立塲，不必過分重視；而最重要的，還在政府對於政治的革新是否有雷厲風行的決心。今後一般公務員能否有自動革以造成一個優良的政風。如果中國政治能講求行政效率，則政風廉潔，事事都走上法治的正軌，則敵黨即無隙可乘，政爭也就無從發動了。所以我們對於這次調整待遇，認爲意義重大，並抱着極大的希望，但願這次調整待遇，是我國政治革新的起點。</p>

<h3>和會昨舉行全體大會　表決制案提出討論　莫洛托夫要求重予修正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎八日廣播：和平會議於今日下午四時（上海時間午夜）召開全體大會，會塲半圓形議席中央，貝爾納斯與莫洛托夫併肩面坐，左係法國代表，英國代表團坐於右方。五分鐘內，各代表依次就位，但塲內座椅僅坐滿三分之二。首先討論表決方法問題，皮杜緬主張用舉手方式表決該案，但莫洛托夫起立發言，謂規程委會昨未接受蘇方建議，實係重大錯誤。蘇聯對該委會議所議決之三分之一多數表決制是也。例如以十一票壓倒十票面强迫他國接受，殊屬不合理，要求全體大會重新予以修正，澳代表伊瓦特對此力予辯駁，激烈辯論刻尙在進行中。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎七日電〕觀察家預料於和會港人具體討論之階段後，特港問題將爲最棘手之問題。和會全體大會定八日下午舉行，屆時當批准規程委員會之舉告，及向五前敵國登出之請柬</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕和會本日開全體會議，採納規程委員會提出之規則。法外長將在前半部會議中任主席，然後依照字母表，由五强國之一國担任主席。依字母表，英國應在法國之後，但中國外長王世杰更有出任主席可能，因中國居於字母表首位，面英首席代表具文尙未題到故也。</p>
<h3>和會預備階段結束　正式議事開始　兩大陣容難免意氣之爭　足爲歐洲現行局勢反映</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕巴黎和會預備階段已於本日結束，但大會本身之各項主要問題，仍懸而未決。二十一國和會首席代表費整整八日功夫，以決定會議程序，四强原來商定之程序雖經八日之激烈辯論，實際未留絲毫創痕。規程委會決議中規定非會員國得由各小組委會之邀請，出席陳述意見。以表決規則而論，該委會決定大會凡三分之二多數或過半多數表決之各項議案，均送交四强外長會議審核。所謂經由過半多數表決之議案，自屬次要怕質。此外四强原定程序其他修正，純爲枝術性質，無足輕重。由是觀之，全體代表出九牛二虎之力，盡唇槍舌劍之爭，所得結果雖然滿意，卻無反動性質，亦云異矣。一般人認爲此乃對立團體初次迎面相爭，每一代表堅持其主張到放錯，足見潛伏的衝突勢力，在和會中仍不失其兇惡性，此不過爲歐洲現行局勢之反映而已，例如規程委會本月六日連夜會議，討論三分之二多數表決規則時，英國與法國各提出修正案，內容大同小異，但蘇聯擁護法國之修正案，英國修正案之擁護者倘亦擁護法國之提案，則法國一案當可一致通過，但結果法國一案被以十三票對八票否決，而英國之修正案則被採納，但並非全塲一致者。某某觀察家認爲此種分裂之幕後觀念，乃爲對於蘇聯代表團作意氣之爭，良以蘇聯代表團得東方各國之支持，曾反對英國修正案到底故也。東方與西方間罅隙，可由此種表決而見其一斑，抑此種罅隙在今日歐洲到處存在，尤其在奧地利爲然。奧地利境內局勢之發展，似將影響巴黎和會之辯論，奧地利境內前德國所有資產之處置問題，四强意見最爲紛歧，和會對此不免遭遇重大難關。職是之故，各觀察家對於程序委員會成立之協議，並不過份歡躍，此項協議實因委員會主席史巴克之調度有方，應付得宜，有以致之耳。</p>

<h3>貝文準備　出席和會　離英確期未定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕今晨此間權威方面稱：外相貝文現仍擬於明日赴巴黎參加和會，但其啓程之計劃，尙未作最後決定，倘磋商巴勒斯坦問題進入嚴重狀態，或將延遲若干日，事實上乃因巴黎會議之程序階段已告結束，將開始討論和約草案，故使貝文急欲早日前往。</p>
<h3>外長會議代表不得担任　和約草案委會主席　我代表同意貝爾納斯建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎七日專電〕貝爾納斯今日在規程委會提出一項修正建議，經會議一致通過。此修正建議爲外長會議之會員國家，不得担任何和約草案委員會之主席，同時如一國代表團之團員當選爲某一委員會主席時，該國代表團其他團員均不得再被任爲另一委員會之主席。貝氏上止血劑建議未被採納之前，我外長王世杰發言，表示完全同意，貝爾納斯之提案。王氏指出我國所處地位之含糊，蓋我國曾出席倫敦五外長會議，而未出席以後之外長會議。王氏宣黎，在任何情形之下，我國均願放棄被告選爲委員會主席之權利。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯助手　將啓程赴巴黎</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕王世杰今晨間在巴黎無名英難墓前獻致花圈，王氏由駐法大使錢泰及和會中國代表團團員數人陪同到達凱旋門，由法國畢蒂茹盎將軍·巴黎警備司令李才蒂霍及法外部禮賓司長狄梅納加以歡迎。王氏等一行當向法國旗鞠躬，軍樂隊演奏中法兩國國歌，禮畢，中國貴均在「金册」上簽名，以留紀念。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕紐約時報記者稱：英人受原子彈等之教訓，感覺下次大戰，規模之大當在前兩次大戰之上。故帝國之防務，必須適應此一新環境外。參謀總長蒙哥馬來元帥之巡視各地，動機即在此。英國對於帝國生命綫之若干要點，尤特別具有敏感。直布羅陀要塞之佈防，其實尙牽涉英蘇對弗朗哥政權之態度，地中海東部，英人亦恐懼蘇聯勢力自特里埃斯特韃靼尼爾或希臘伸入。埃及民族意識之滋長，使其不得不放棄尼羅河流域之據點。巴勒斯坦之動亂，將影響英國在中東建立新基地之計劃。伊拉克近亦要求與英另訂新條約，而伊朗國內之不安，使英伊油田感受相等之威脅。更遠則俄人似欲經由阿富汗而伸入印度，故緬甸將成英國在東方之主要基地，而西藏亦將因此取得重要之新地位。</p>
<h3>和會人物素描　砲彈外交家大顯身手　悶熱天氣中驅走睡魔</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕悶熱的盧林堡宮，足以使廿一國的代表感覺十分沉悶，假若沒有莫洛托夫和伊瓦特等砲彈外交家滔滔不絕的言辭，各代表都不免要呼呼入睡了。號稱澳洲貝文的伊瓦特是和會中最活躍的一人，他不時在會塲躑躅，找尋談話對手，人人對這位寬肩灰髪，目光灼灼，老是穿一身不甚稱身的藍色服裝的外交家，都已感覺熟悉了。伊瓦特是和會舉行以來發言最多的一人，也是最注意他人演說的一人。他的個性正與比利時的主度史巴克相反，史氏具有莊嚴鄭重的態度，戴一副玳瑁邊眼鏡，繋一根蝴蝶結領帶，開會的時候，常常將一隻手臂支着椅子的靠手，兩眼注視着天花枝上古色古香的裝飾，有時也偶而記錄一下他人的演說，態度顯得十分安閒。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫在不發言的時候，也顯得十分安靜，他不大跑來跑去，喜歡與本國的代表團共享「家庭之樂」。摸鬍鬚似乎是他不能改變的習慣，他的助手駐英大使古賽夫，具有令人莫測高深的面貌。另一助手維辛斯基，却比較活動得多，然而坐在莫洛托夫之旁，似已不如參加倫敦聯合國會議的好動了。坐在蘇聯代表團對面的，是加總理金氏架一副無脚的眼鏡，當譯員翻譯他人的演說時，除非是英語，總是將目光注視着對面的牆上。捷克外長馬薩里克是一位身材高大而好修飾的紳士，說話不脫幽默的情趣。坐在主席另一側的是印度代表希亞甘，是全塲服裝顏色中動人的一位，因俏他穿的是印度裝。中國代表王世杰流利端莊而斯文條有理的英語頗傳得全塲一致的注意。</p>
<h3>義備忘錄內容</h3>

<h3>美國的新聞學府　米蘇里的田園風光　杜魯門總統故郷</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>〔肯撒斯城芋月十三日航訊〕美國的晨業區，集中在兩個主要部份。一個在五大湖的沿岸，以威斯康辛密歇根，伊利諾安幾州爲代表，另一個是密西西比河流，以米蘇里，密西西比，得克撒斯，易西安那幾州爲代表。米蘇里介乎美國南北之間，南北戰爭時代，米蘇里是「平衡均勢」的部份，一直到現在，米蘇里州的黑人與白人的「種族界綫」，旣不像南方那樣苛酷，也不像北方那樣開明。美國人，特別是紐約，芝加哥，幾個大都市裏的美國人，他們對來自「田間」的米蘇里人，視同土頭土腦的「郷曲」。實際上，米蘇里州的美國人確比其他地方的敦樸，老實，淳厚，也比其他任何地方爲「土」，他們的生命綫是農業</p>
<p>他們安於農業社會的自然秩序。第二次世界大戰以前，舊金山曾經舉行過一次美國全國的物產「博覽會以，米蘇里州送去的物產，是箍得四英寸長的麥穗，博覽會的負責人和觀衆，都讚偑米蘇里的農產，但又覺得米蘇里州派來的代表土頭土腦得可愛，於是都逗着他開玩笑。紐約州的代表：「你那四寸長的麥穗，有什麼希罕？我們紐約有六寸長的！」這是開玩笑的話，但是那位「土代表」信以爲眞，他緊跟着紐約州的代表叫「Show　me！（給我看）」。加里福尼亞的代表看得實在可笑，揷嘴說：「六寸長的有什麼了不起，我們加里福尼亞，八寸長的麥穗，不算一回事！」米蘇里代表立刻伸出手來說」Show　me！」如今「hSow　me！」變成了一般的米蘇里欠外號</p>
<p>無論在軍隊中，在國際性的大都市，美國人遇見美國人，問姓道名以後，如果一方說「米蘇里人」，對方便然的說一聲「Show　me！」」，正如同在中國看見合肥人便說「老母雞」一樣。米蘇里人並不以旁人嘲訕爲恥，他們永遠改不掉敦樸，淳厚的天性，相反的他們覺得有保存這一種天性的必要。歷史上，米蘇里州從來沒有過「驚天動地」的政治人物，這次杜魯門做了現成的總統，米蘇里人曾經有過空前的高興，但他們的淳樸的個性，常常推動他們的理智。許多中國留學生在米蘇里大學念書，問他們的本地同學，對於杜魯門出任總統的感想，大槪所有的同學都是一致的，他們認爲「哈雷（杜魯門的小名）是一個誠薦的人，但並不過合於當大總統。」我從聖路易到肯撤斯的途中，曾經在哥侖比亞小城逗留過一夜，在旅館裏，在路上，我問他們是否義得杜魯門總統？他們都像很親節似的說：「哦，哈雷，我們知道他，他是一個好人！」米蘇里人認爲這是他們誠篤社會的成功。凡是到過米蘇里的外地人或者外國人，看著他們安祥的農業社會，看著他們田間長熟了的膏粱肥稻花香，你一定會感覺到這種田園生活的可愛。在米蘇里，物價比紐約要便宜一倍。幾位在米蘇里大學念新聞學的朋友，化不到二十塊錢一月的房租，可以住一間高明几浄的舒適上房，包飯在鄰居老太太家裏，化五塊半錢，吃一個星期，天天有大塊的猪肉或牛肉。這種便宜的生活，是住慣紐約芝加哥的人，所不能想像得到的。米蘇里的農業社會之所以富，得力於河流的灌漑。密西西比河流在東邊，米蘇里河橫貫在全州，雖然，米蘇里全州盡是邱陵地帶；但是斜坡之上，丘壑之間，都成了農作物的最好產地。汽車一開出聖路易城，沿第四十號國道向西直走，一路上，盡是起伏不平的邱陵地帶，走一百三十餘哩，便是哥侖比亞。哥侖比亞並不是米蘇里的省會，米蘇里的省會在傑茀遜，在哥侖比亞南卅一哩，因爲不靠交通大道，而且聽說省城小得可憐，所以沒有去觀光。哥侖比亞之所以得名，完全靠的有米蘇里大學。全城居民僅一萬八千人，加上米蘇里大學的學生在內，也不過三萬人左右。米蘇里大學現任校長密特波希，是美國一位有名的政治經濟學者，但米蘇里大學之所以馳名，並不靠政治經濟學，而是新聞學院和農學。新聞學院佔兩幢樓房，納孚樓的地下層，是排字房和印刷房；二樓是院長辦公室，編輯，採防部；三樓是廣告室和陳列室。威廉樓的地下層是攝影室；二樓是社論室，營業室，和打字實習室，三樓是新聞學院的圖書館。我參觀米蘇里大學新聞學院不過三個鐘點，但就我個人的感想，我覺得米蘇里大學新聞教育之所以成功，完全得力於理論與實際打成一片。新聞學院在這座小城裏，辦了一個唯一的日報「米蘇里人報」，有特別設置的印刷房，還有特別從外邊聘請的印刷工人，學生輪流寫社論，編新聞，採訪消息，他們所寫的，所編的，所採的，每天見諸自辦的報紙，剪下來彙合起來，便是學期的成績。米蘇里大學也講新聞理論，也講「報學史」，現任院長莫脫先生，便是一位滔滔不絕的講理論的人。我沒有會見莫脫院長，副主任夏潑先生，和我談了許多中國學生在米蘇里新聞學院的掌故。許多當年的中國學生，現在都是中國新聞界的前輩或知名之士了。我在新聞學院二樓的會客室裏，看見汪英賓先生送給米蘇里「母校」的對聯，看見邵元冲先生書贈新聞學院廿五週年的鏡框，還看見孔庸之先生以燕京大學校長名義，書贈新聞學院的屏聯。新聞學院東列室內陳列許多東方有關新聞事業的古畫。民國元年正月六日，江蘇都督府頒發給上海大陸報記者克勞的「通行證」，准許他赴各城市採訪新聞「出入各城門」的證件，懸掛壁端，據說這張通行片，還是臨時大總統孫中山先生親自批准的。此外，日本人送給米蘇里新聞學院的紀念品甚多，日本的澁澤子爵有照片和題詩，東京三田新聞學會會長久野文雄，也有一幅字條掛在陳列室。（未完）</p>

<h3>工商界寄予莫大希望！　請願團昨夜晉京　冀政府抓取時機迅予急救　各業昨午舉行茶會歡送</h3>

<p>參加團員已近半百</p>
<p>市商會各同業公會，於昨日下午四時，特假商會議事廰，舉行茶會，歡送請願團團員，出席各團員，各公會代表，及各報社記者約一百餘人。首由諸尙一氏致詞，略稱：工商業現已届生死存亡關頭，請願國此去成敗得失，關係整個工商業之成敗。務望各團員努力，請求當局接受工商界之意見，以拯工商業於水火之中云。旋由商會秘書長嚴諤聲氏報吿請願團籌備經過，並稱：截至目前爲止，參加團員，已達四十七位。請願團並於先三日，請陶桂林君晋京部署一切。並聞鎭江，杭州·無錫一帶之商會，均有代表於今日在京會集。</p>
<p>請願團昨晚出發時在北車站留影　（中國社攝）</p>
<p>請願要旨各具四點</p>
<p>至請願要旨，商會及工業協會，各具四點，商會除各有呈文一紙外，尙有聯名呈文一紙。各公會方面，亦各有呈文，現已收到六紙。現除推定吳蘊初等五位爲對外總代表外，對內總幹事，已推定田和卿汪劍平兩氏。此外大致可望於十一日返滬。嚴氏詞畢，田和卿氏代表工業協會，報吿該會此番請願之四大原則，計：（一）速辦緊急工貸。據統計，本市各工業公會四十五單位，擬請貸款者有卅家，請求貸款數字，達一千五百六十餘億元，連尙未有函送到之十三家公會在內，估計貸款數字，將逾二千億元。（二）協調勞資糾紛：（甲）實行最低工資法，（乙）維護工廠行政管理權，（丙）工廠有停閉之自由權。（三）工業復員：務使工廠一律復員，對於接收之敵僞工廠生產工具及完好原料，應予優先承購權。（四）工業貼補：（甲）實施捐稅退回政策，（乙）以低價配給原物料動力及運輸工具等。</p>
<p>駱清華扶病趕到</p>
<p>五時卅分，主席駱淸華氏，扶病趕到會塲，即席致詞，略稱：本人以抱病之軀，不克與請願團同行，殊爲抱歉。請願團之舉，在主月廿三日商會召開全體會員大會時，即已決定，此行富具歴史性，任務空前，意義重大而迫切。目前工商業之危機，日甚一日，廠商日有閉歇，如此現狀，斷不能置而不顧。復員後，本人與政府當局，及工商界方面，均有接觸。政府人士對月前工商業危機，非不明瞭。看法大致有二：其一，認爲目前危機之造成，係因國家參加八年抗戰，經濟能力破壊最重，故危機之來，係出諸自然，非人力所能挽救。主要應結，尙有待政治問題之解決，然後始能使經濟逐步復蘇。於是乃全力着眼於緊縮信用之途，以期緊縮結果，財政收支可望平衡。故工貸吿緊，工業生產隨以萎縮，物資愈見稀少，通貨愈見增多，結果適得其反，收支距離愈趨擴大。另一方面之看法，則認爲通貨之去路有二：用於生產建設性者，應儘量擴充。用於普通消費者，應加緊縮。政府各項必要而龐大之支出，如公務員新津等，不妨考慮部份以實物替代。如按此原則施政，則可望達到眞正之收支平衡。惟此兩論爭，迄未獲得協調。故工商界以身歷其境第三者之立塲，現應有所聲訴。蓋現階段之政治協商問題，已有無從談起之感。而經濟工商界之危機日逼，果一旦崩潰，則國家及社會秩序，將何以堪。故深望政府當局對工商界應抱救死不如救生之決心。現悉政府方面，對工商界處境同情之人民，日增一日。工商界對此項同情，應予全力支援。故望請願團此行，應切實簡括向政府提示兩點肌：（一）問題刻已臻最嚴重階段，（二）時機已到最後關頭。設政府不熊抓取時機，予以急救，則整個工商界，必將陷於萬刧不復之境。政府過去缺乏全面經濟政策，僅有錯誤之財政政策，致金融政策，亦從而趨於歧途。請願團此行，應促使政府將過去之錯誤政策，改爲對的政策。故此行是富於歷史性的·同時，請願國此行動機純潔，目的係對事而非對人。且絕對擁護政府，希望政府從速解救工商界當前困難。最後壽景偉，潘士浩，馬少荃等，復分別陳詞，大會至六時卅分，始吿散席。</p>

<h3>大有餘油廠大火　捐失逾六萬萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西西蘇州河路三十六號大有餘油廠，規模宏大，昨日下午四時五十分，該廠老車間因走電忽吿火警，當時風勢甚大，延燒甚速，波及西首L.G.兩貨物堆棧，一棧儲有蔴袋八萬只，另一棧房堆置黃豆五千包，棉籽三千包，俱遭焚毁。當火熾時，宜昌路消防處及中央區等各消防處相繼到達，接水灌救，無如火勢已旺，且堆棧內部所儲之蔴袋黃荳棉籽及油類等，均係易燃之物，故不易撲滅，直至晚間九時半，火勢始漸見熄滅，惟餘燼尙在，直至今最二時，救火車尙未駛去，以防死灰復燃。事後據該廠經理薛潤生吿稱：全部損失逾六萬萬元以上，又有一部份機械亦遭焚燬，但該項貨物曾在天一太平等保險公司保有巨額火險云。</p>

<h3>發還資廠物資案　清查團現正調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪接收淸査團吳委員望伋，就昨日本報所載之檢舉韓人軍火商孫田昌植案有所詢問，據談此案淸査團正進行調査，全案未決定前，不願有所表示，唯此案關係重大，必要時將呈行政院，至於此類案件敵偽產業處理局及審議會皆應負責，至少有延誤之責任。但清查團決儘速進行辦理云。又訊：經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員辦公處，關於接收情形，各方頗多指摘，行院訓令飭送詳細報吿，以便査核，聞該處已遵令申覆。</p>
<h3>重慶勞動協會事件　朱學範報告經過　提出四項籲請各界主持公道</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國勞動協會，因該會重慶辦事處及談會在重慶所辦之醫院等若干福利組織，於本月八日淸晨，突爲便衣人員及武裝警員等二百餘人，所强佔，並有該會職員二十餘人被扣，特於昨日下午，招待本市各報社記者。首由該會朱學範氏報吿，略謂該會成立，已達十年，於今年二月遷滬後，因事實需要，在重慶所辦之各種事業如工人福利社，勞工醫院，托兒所，工人文化服務隊，勞工學校（八所）等，仍予續辦。不意八月六日淸晨六時許，突有便衣人員及武裝警士等二百餘人，將此等機關及該會重慶辦事處，同時强行佔領，當時交通斷絕，形勢嚴重，該會職員亦有二十餘人被扣。勞工醫院之病人亦皆不准離院。此等武裝人員，自稱奉有命令，而此數組織距離甚遠，竟於同時被佔，顯非少數人所能辦到，而係有計劃之行動也。</p>
<p>此事發生前二星期左右，重慶總工會理事鄧發淸所辦之「勞聲報」曾有消息，誣指勞動協會欲組暗殺團。惟査該會在淪負責人慈幼院院長爲周穎女士，係中央政治學校畢業，而勞工醫院院長趙素園醫師，係加拿大留學生，且爲基督徒，固皆決不致有政治活動或謀鼓動工潮也。</p>
<p>朱氏繼稱：該會不特從未鼓動工潮，且曾竭力協助政府解決工潮。如去年八月，即曾協助解決工潮七起，九月份二十九起，十月份三十六起，十一月份三十七起，十二月份三十八起，本年一月份十七起，二月份十八起，（三月以後即遷滬）。至於處理捐款則不但賬目已由立信公信二會計師事務所詳加審核，且平時動用款項，亦須先經美國工界救濟金監理會核准，賬册皆在儘可覆按。該會爲合法團體，十年間襄助抗戰，提倡增產，力謀提高工人地位，而今日乃受此意外打擊，是以呼籲各界，主持公道，並提出要求四項（一）請求釋放該會被捕人員；（二）査辦此次事件之主使人，（三）請求政府保障人權，保障職員之安全，保證今後不再發生類似事件，（四）要求强佔此等機關者即行退出。</p>
<p>旋美國工界救濟金監理會代表章元善起稱，該會係一名符其實之監督機關，救濟金到華後，先存監理會，勞動協會動用款項時，須先辦預算，經該會通過後，並須轉美國由捐款機關同意，然後始可發給，如勞工協會領款用途並非與工人福利及抗戰有關者，監理會自決不加以考慮。勞工協會賬目現皆存監理會，今春且曾將眼目於報上公佈一次，確無不盡不責之事。</p>
<p>朱學範氏於答覆記者詢問時稱：重慶工人對鄧發淸等負責之「總工會」無信仰、乃各自組工會，加人勞動協會。彼本人將於本周內晋京，向當局呼籲。</p>
<h3>榮家兩弟兄被控侵佔罪　申新股本　引起糾葛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕榮德生之子榮爾仁，與姪榮鴻元（榮宗敬之子），頃爲無錫人丁梓仁向法院控吿兩人侵佔罪，該案昨在地院刑四庭開審，緣丁與榮家原爲親戚，於民國八年共同將宜昌路恒昌源紗廠盤下改爲申新二廠，當時資本共爲五十萬，丁佔十萬，並由丁出任總經理，後因年老體弱，乃將總經理職位讓予榮鴻元，並由榮爾仁担任經理，現丁控吿榮氏兩弟兄於接手後即將丁之股本逐漸轉爲已戶，而常初合夥受盤時，因係親家，故並未立有議據，僅在資本帳上註明，但該項資本帳已爲藏匿云。昨日丁本人未到，委托律師出庭，兩被吿亦未到庭，據代理律師稱：榮爾仁現在美國，榮鴻元則因事不克到庭，現此案可能和解，請庭上准予改期，該案遂展期再訊。</p>

<p>據美軍方面的調查，德國在華第五縱隊的活動，遠在太平洋戰事爆發前即已開始。這些第五縱隊以商人及外交使節的身份掩蔽他們本來的面目。因爲儘管德國人以前曾經帮助過中國訓練軍隊，但在時機上需要於遠東找一個盟國時，他們選中了日本。可是德國人又非常狡猾，他們也顧慮到中國得到最後勝利的可能性，因此決定在表面上依舊做中國的友人，祗在暗底裏與日本人約定，用卑鄙的幕後的活動，帮助日本，爲害中國。形式上他們沒有對中國人發過一槍一彈，實際上他們却使中國遭受了更大的損害。戰時首都重慶之受在炸，就是這些僕僕渝滬之間「受信任」的德國人的成績，他們把重慶的防空設備詳詳細細的吿訴了日本人。可以說：重慶之成爲世界上受炸最慘的都市，主要皆是拜受他們之賜。</p>
<p>幕後活動刺探軍情</p>
<p>這種幕後的間諜活動，到一九四二年來華負責以後更達到了新的高潮。愛森德萊格也就是現在所起訴的第一名罪犯歐哈德，他以前在巴爾幹從事第五縱隊的工作，成績卓著。到中國以後，先以商人的姿態出現，然後作爲上海大使館中的一員，實際上担任「歐哈德局」的首腦。在他主持之下，華北分局的主要負責者是弗爾克勒和希雪兩人，其任務是：（一）搜集各項有關美軍在華登陸之情報，（二）報吿關於中國政府之情報及政治與軍事動態，並經由在滬之大使館及指揮部供給日方，（三）報告關於延安之情報及中共之政治軍事動態，（四）報吿各項關於美蘇間關係，物資供應，空運海運及軍事動態之情報。除此以外，尚有四項次要目標：（一）華北美空軍之行動，（二）美海軍艦隊之活動，（三）重慶與延安之關係，（四）中國軍隊經西安綫之供應狀况，（五）自由中國經蘭州綫之供應狀况。</p>
<h3>要犯希斯　本是軍事顧問</h3>
<p>至於在上海及其他各地，歐哈德局所供給日本人的情報是美空運隊和中航機運輸供應物質的路綫，軍隊的調動，游擊隊的位置，美艦隊及護航的動態，以及戰綫內受傷的盟國艦只的地點。此外在駐東京的德海軍武官團指揮之下，歐哈德局更與在華的大使館，商業機關和德華銀行密謀合作，私運鎢鈔及其他重要物資供應納粹作戰機構。</p>
<p>而當戰爭後期，日本人屢圖與中國談判和平失敗後，竟計劃把中國一省一省的分化，想從廣西開始，然後雲南，然後四川。在執行這陰謀中，歐哈德局也盡了「中間」人的任務。重要戰犯之一的希斯，由於他多年來担任中國的軍事顧問，認識不少廣西將領。他自動地願意担當這任務，事實上他也的確進行過，但這陰謀終於由於他所接觸的人物的忠貞堅定而失敗了。</p>
<p>德國投降以後，他們繼續從事這種破壊性的工作。他們癡心夢想的希望聯合國間發生裂痕，希望日本得到最後勝利。上自外交人員下至商人，他們貢獻一切力量，一切物資來協助日本，直到日本投降爲止。</p>
<p>美軍法庭　起訴主文</p>
<p>現在，從歐哈德起，大大小小的二十三名戰犯，已經監禁在提籃橋監獄裏靜候審判。美軍司法處對他們起訴的主文如下：「一九四五年五月八日至八月十五日間，時美日尙在作戰，留居中國之德人愛森德萊格（化名歐哈德），西伯格里區，……等分別以其德國官吏，國民，公民，間諜，雇員之身份，繼續從事有意識有目的而不合法之不利於美國及其盟邦之軍事活動，破壞德國之無條件投降。以供給，授權，允許，不予制止各種對於日本武裝部隊及其諜報機關之協助，消息，情報，宣傳，物費等之背約行爲幫助日本對美作戰，破壊戰事法律及習慣。」這二十三人不久就要出現在美軍事法庭上受他們應得的責罰。在本文的最後，似乎有把他們的身份作一番介紹的必要：（一）歐哈德——首腦，（二）西伯——廣州領事，（三）格里區——廣州領事館秘書，（四）沃托－－華南納粹黨領袖，（五）希斯，（六）烏勃里區，（七）尼門，（八）羅特勞夫，（九）海勃尼區，（十）台斯勒夫，（十一）斯根基，（十三）庇斯基，（十三）毛斯勃，（十四）拉斯基，（十五）弗爾克勒，（十六）希雪，（十七）利脫，（十八）其格——均歐哈德局間諜。（十九）華門——駐僞府大使，（二十）斯脫路——大使館上海辦事處主任，（二十一）倫社——上海領事，（二十）（二）卜凱麥——上海情報部主任，（二十三）羅門－上海情報部職員。</p>

<h3>獄中風光好？　成立書畫社　組織俱樂部　袁履登悠閒　自稱好比靜養機會難得</h3>
<p>是一個偶然的機會，記者和六十七歲的「海上三老」之一袁體登，作了幾十分鐘的談話。</p>
<p>他和大多數老年人的夏季裝束一樣，穿一件白紡綢長衫，着一雙黑布鞋，手裏拿一把有字畫的摺扇。</p>
<p>問起他對於被判無期徒刑的感想，他苦笑了笑，久久沒有表示。到後來突然吿訴記者說：一個月以前，幾位朋友已爲我上書最高法院，另外寗波同鄕會亦有請求，他輕輕的嘆一口氣，以「將來大家自會明白的」，這句話作了結束。言下似對外界的「不瞭解」，表示　惜。</p>
<p>話題扯到了聞蘭亭的不肯出獄受審上。他說：聞蘭亭在高檢處開第一次偵査庭時，就當庭表示過，以後不再出庭，予以缺席判決好了。到現在他還是這樣表示。假如一定要拖拖拉拉强迫他出庭，那末到了庭上將不回答一句話。前些時聞蘭亭在患牙病，所以身體不大好，現在牙齒已經拔去，這幾天已恢復健康了。</p>
<p>記者問他監獄中亦有牙醫生嗎？他回答應有盡有。周邦　（中西大　房總經理）和前後「衛生局長」袁濬昌袁矩範等都在，下至理髮師扦脚的都有。</p>
<p>「好比靜養，這亦是個難得的機會」他似在安慰自己說，在從前，東忙西忙，每天應酬多，吃晚飯要趕四五處地方，這兒黃酒，那兒啤酒，幸虧我身體好，所以從不看醫生，這是天保佑。</p>
<p>聞蘭亭唸唸經打打坐　林康侯看看書寫寫字</p>
<p>在監獄中算舒服的了，每人一個房間，聞蘭打現在每天唸唸經，打亭坐，林康侯則看看書，寫寫字，亦很悠閒，梁鴻聲部雖然被判了死刑，但很是鎭靜，現在每天忙着寫字作畫，蔡培徐季敦等還集合了二十多個人成立了一個需　社，現在還在計劃組織一個俱樂部。</p>
<p>他最後又談到進獄的經過，說是去年九月二十七日，有人到我家裏來說，戴先生找我談話，聞蘭亭林康侯等都已先在，我就一同跟他們到愚園路。在那裏並沒有就見到戴先生，當時聞蘭亭就表示滴水不進，經一番解釋，大家亦就在那裏住下。以後又搬到福履理路，後來一部份人又搬到南市去。這期間和戴先生祇見過一面，過不多時就被解到這裏來了。</p>
<p>記者間起他在獄中看不看報，他搖搖頭，直截爽快的回答說：「我不看一張報，我不要看」。</p>
<p>一位攝影記者跑過來替他照相，他坦然的坐坐正，對照相的人說：你拍好了。我的照外面多得很，還有簽名的呢。</p>

<h3>各區保幹事　暫以男性為限</h3>
<p>現任女性調區服務</p>
<p>市府民政處以保幹事爲自治基幹人員，事務複雜，責任綦重，本市各區保辦公處專任幹事，規定僅設一人，自非遴選體格强健，精神旺盛，能刻苦耐勞之人員充任，則不足以應付，婦女因生理及體力上之關係，實不宜充任，茲特規定（一）各區任用保幹事暫以男性爲限，（二）現任女性保幹事，應儘速設法與區公所書記對調服務，以重自治，聞民政處已分函各區公所查照辦理。</p>
<h3>戶籍法規　疑義答問　（續）</h3>
<p>（三）　人事登記類</p>
<p>（四十）問：民間多喜娶童養媳，依法予以養女之記登，人民多爭執，應如何解決？</p>
<p>答：童養媳仍依法予以養女之登記，而於備攷欄內注明「擬將來擇配某子。」並吿知其圓房之日，再聲請爲結婚登記。</p>
<p>（四一）問：童養媳予以養女登記，似有同姓爲婚之嫌，妨害社會善良風俗，，可否改爲「撫養」登記？</p>
<p>答：童養媳原非法定名稱，但爲習俗所恒有，爲確定其身份計，自可比照收養關係辦理。依民法一零七八條，養子女從收養者之姓，圓房之後，則收養關係終止，依法自應回復其原姓。同時並依民法第一零零零條，冠以夫姓，或從其約定同姓爲婚，法律上並不禁止。而在收養關係終止時，以前之父女或母女名份，已不存在，亦不妨害社會善良風俗，自可不必改爲「撫養」登記。</p>
<p>（四二）問：死亡原因之查塡，在衛生機關尙未普設前，頗感困難，究應如何辦理？</p>
<p>答：關係死亡原因之査塡，依照修正戶籍法施行細則第九條第三項之規定，應由當地衛生機關爲必要之協助。如當地設有衛生機關者，仍應詳塡死因，其未設立之處，可採用因病·自殺·受刑等爲死因之分類，較易査塡，而符事實。</p>
<h3>榮譽軍人　不得強迫勸募</h3>

<h3>成本高銷路滯印染業在苦悶中　陰丹士林黑市兩千萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據印染業中人稱：目前該業處境，除與一般工業，同樣感受高利貸及高工資之壓迫外，印染業所需之染料，亦感缺乏，此中尤以不褪色之陰丹士林爲最。據悉：前數月間，本市德孚洋行淸理處，尙有相當數量配售。雖不能言多，惟尙堪數用。最近則配售量逐漸减少，且聞有將斷檔之虞。現陰丹士林之配售價，每担約爲一千萬元。惟黑市價，均在二千萬元左右，影響生產成本殊鉅。美國方面，現雖亦有保晒霖等替代品，惟產量不多。本年上半年之定貨，迄今遲遲未到。下半年且聞暫不接受定貨。此項染料之短絀問題，目前巳感相當威脅，設一旦恢復大量生產，則此問題。將益趨嚴重。</p>
<p>目前印染業產品銷路，以各地秩序未復，交通阻隔，除廣帮去路稍有起色外，一般銷路極爲呆滯。一方面中國紡建公司所屬各印染廠，亦有相當數量之產品，廉價供市應銷，故產品價格，亦極平疲。據悉：目前印染業務，除印製業務尙有微利可圖外，染色業務，大多　蝕。故單恃染色爲業務之各廠，無不叫苦連天。蓋以普通一九〇士林布而言，市價每疋八萬元。此中單坯布一項，價已佔五萬二千元。而自坯布染成士林布之過程，平均約需時兩週。染布每疋所支出之工資，燃料，利息運銷管理各費，決非二萬八千元所能濟事。然目前各廠均有欲罷不能之苦衷，蓋職工無法遣散，故勉力開工，蓋純以維持員工之生活爲職志矣。</p>
<p>又據若干廠商語記者：目前南洋方面，以節令終年如夏，故各種色布及花布之去路殊佳，價亦較國內爲合理。而國內則因各地交通未復，客帮無法來滬採辦，致去路呆滯，市價日瀉。而已方面生產成本，則日見增高徒使各印染廠減縮生產量。在此苦悶之處境中，貨紗布爭取南洋市塲，一方面亦能以外銷之增加，而刺激各廠之生產量，似爲一舉兩得之救濟辦法。</p>
<h3>金鈔平穩港票需求頗殷</h3>
<p>烚赤昨甚平穩，惟成交更少，起仆亦窄，晨開一九一萬八，業外需要仍殷，開後升至一九三萬五，十時後央行配給一〇〇條，價一九一萬五，此後曾見低價一九一萬三，過程平庸，經少數金號業吸收下，午刻又升至一九二萬至一九二萬五之間，午後交易雖少，穩定之象，尙難持久，喊價微回，結果與前收相彷彿，銀樓飾金以及紋銀銀元均乏變化，暗拆銀根轉平，求供均衡，暗息自一角至一角二分不等。</p>
<p>外幣美平港俏，美鈔晨開二五三〇元有賣，開後即稍低落，外幣不准抵用之風聲仍濃，無甚需用，中途曾迫近二五〇〇元關，午刻略穩，在二五二〇元左右盤旋，午後亦穩，結果較前收微升五元，港票需求復股，結果又升二元，港滙五五〇元，印滙六六五元，英滙八千八均有買戶，賣價遞升一檔，形勢趨緊，交易略活，美滙掛牌仍平，銀行對做則因供源更苛而復呆。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢恍惚</h3>
<p>華股雖欲上進，大戶並無活動，缺乏鼓勵，加之美亞臨收洩氣，牽動全局，大勢復形恍惚，永紗目七〇〇元光景拉高至七二〇元，美亞則自四二三〇元回跌至三九五〇元，三小熱中途最俏，開收均疲，期貨低於現貨行市一擋，人心無意哄抬，可見一斑，期貨息亦减低至一角〇五及一角半，場內除童某力購永紗五六十萬股外，別無多大活動，結果較前收計永紗微升，美亞略跌，景福新光各跌二元，勤興尙平，冷門中型平疲，小型股以收市早，尙形續漲，三老股又稍見跌。</p>
<p>外股交易仍少，各股喊便略有出入，大致均在前日價左右徘徊，不過大股暫疲，小股尙定，結果與前收相較計怡紗英聯會德豐亞洲微降，鋼業稍升，怡啤紙業業廣尙平。</p>
<h3>債市紅票充斥</h3>
<p>公債難望重振，操業者旣壓　紅票，交割者遂都爭先解出，因而充斥更甚，買戶戒懼，統丙自晨開六六〇元步降至六二〇元而後見定，結果較前牧下跌五十元，甲乙亦小二十元，丁降三十元戊種徽挫十元。</p>
<h3>小額鈔不得拒用</h3>
<p>市近有少數銀行錢莊，有藉詞拒收五十元及一百元鈔劵情事，事關整個金融及法幣信用，已由財政部電飭上海市銀錢業公會，照常收受，不得歧視，本市社會財政兩局，並將會銜佈吿，令本由銀行錢莊以及其他各業，一體遵照。</p>
<h3>米價續漲</h3>
<p>昨日南北米市共到四五千石，緣產價高昻，搬運不通，販客多數虧本，是以新貨來源稀少，店方零化略動，粳秈米續升一二千元，新粳來貨亦少，再加千餘元，麵粉以洋粉絡續出售，人心不振，猛跌四五百元，黃豆新貨續到，去胃仍懈，高貨尙覺勉立，中次依然步削，陳黃豆亦隨之軟化，生仁來貨不多，市勢暫定，油市靑島略有貨到，豆油廠方供應尙續，回小千元，形居忽上忽落，甚難逆料，豆餅消化續淡，價格下挫三四百元。</p>
<h3>麵粉仍禁出口</h3>
<p>本市麵粉工業同業公會，前呈請市政府轉呈糧食部要求取消禁令，據悉市府已奉糧食部電復，略謂頃奉行政院指令，滬市民食，尙未脫離緊急時期，麵粉仍應禁止轉口，市府已令飭市社會局及荳米業知照，此後本市麵粉除行總及糧食部報運者外，其他任何機關及個人仍不准報運轉口云</p>
<h3>三行兩居奉諭不參加準備會</h3>
<p>〔南京八日電〕四聯總處八月八日上午十時舉行第三一五次理事會議各理事均出席由俞部長鴻鈞担任主席除核定重要放款二十餘件外並由俞部長報吿奉　主席設，現在籌備組織之上海市銀錢業聯合準備庫，爲商營行莊聯合資力互謀協助之機構，中國交通農民三銀行及中央信託局郵政匯業局各國家金融機構不應參加。</p>
<h3>紗市闌珊花布轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍無生氣，客銷沉寂，交易清淡之至，廿支紗上落甚激，四十二支約降二三萬，同行間之買賣亦類缺乏，益以天熱關係，開盤甚遲，而收市反見提前，人心闌珊，趨勢仍極不振。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊回漲十六至廿三磅音，計近期美金三四·五〇，新花遠期三一。四三，米特林現貨三五·三〇，本埠現棉交易續暢，申新第二及統益新生安達大通　數等紗廠均有採辦，市價頻升一二千。</p>
<p>中檔坯布銷路驟增，因粤閩浙等處對於元色布需求殷切，因此染方及號家紛紛搜羅，於是情况活潑，民營廠之富貴大鵬華南採辦尤鵪，近日坯布轉佳，幸紡建公司依然供給，市態尙平，惟嗶幾因籌碼充足，仍然疲乏，午時紡建照例開售細布，僅高五六百元，嗶嘰勿動，餘者亦與上次相仿。</p>
<h3>人造絲又高漲</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲突呈高漲，一二〇號天橋有光現貨，開盤只喊一百五十一萬五千元，轉瞬間即做五十三萬元，同行中成交頗繁，終做至五十五萬元收盤，中紡開價與上期無上落，但一二〇號有光仍無貨開出，下午人心更振，卒做五十九萬元，較上日高七萬元，一二〇號雜牌有光，頗有實銷，價亦跟進，如金三馬上午首先做四十八萬元，旋又升二三萬元，下午復做五十六萬元，比隔日好起入萬元，一二〇號半光，大五六萬元，一五〇號有光，大三四萬元，七五號半光竟漲起九萬元，綢貨交易奇稀，惟華　　因原料高昻，抬高做二千元，廠經用戶絲稍有交易，價喊高五萬元之諧。</p>
<h3>茶業建議辦法四項挽救當前迫切危機</h3>
<p>中國茶業協會，以茶業當前危機，迫於眉睫，亟須求政府以有效方法，立予挽救，爰由各同業擬具節略，公推代表晋京，向政府請求救濟，其要點有四項如下。</p>
<p>（一）請政府辦理茶葉出口津貼　印度政府因英國茶價低於成本，曾辦理茶葉出口津貼，每磅達九便土之巨，美國亦曾辦理棉花出口津貼，故擬請政府辦理出口津貼。</p>
<p>（二）請政府續辦茶葉易貨　抗戰初期政府曾以茶葉與蘇聯易貨，並空運美國接濟北非銷路，頗有相當成績，茲煮茶葉外銷停頓，亟宜恢復對蘇易貨，此外並可視各國需求物品辦理易貨，如法屬北非需要華茶，可請法政府以安南之米交換。</p>
<p>（三）請政府運用經濟外交擴展華茶市塲査現有若干國家關稅，頗間有不利華茶之規定，如英國限制今年華茶進口數量爲二百五十萬磅，美國對華茶限價極低，又如爲我國綠茶最大市塲之北非法　摩洛哥，法政府有禁止華茶進口之命令。擬請政府循外交途徑與各該國交涉，免除上述各種限制。</p>
<p>（四）請政府續辦茶貸並展緩茶貸還本日期　今年政府爲扶助東南茶業，指定中農貸放茶貸七十億元，限期三月，目前外銷一時尙難開展，擬請政府展緩還本日期，又今年茶商以輸出貿易利潤較低，對於利息負担，均有過重之感。擬請政府特予核准减低茶貸利息。又製成箱茶，仍有賴於政府續貸精製貸款。至湘鄂所產磚茶，年約五十餘萬担，事關對蘇易貨，亦擬請迅速准予辦理貸款</p>
<h3>魯烟葉增產</h3>
<p>今年可達十萬磅</p>
<p>據悉：我山東，河南等地烟葉收獲，今歲預計可達十萬零二千五百萬磅，較之戰前產量，固有不逮，惟可超越去年產量二倍以上云。</p>
<h3>減低提存已無問題重貼現尚在考慮中</h3>
<p>近來金融業，甚盼中央銀行迅即舉辦重貼現，頃據該行負責人談：重貼現問題，仍在審愼考慮，因目前上海市面票據，極爲複雜，生產性與非生產性，不易分別辨識，而重貼現之目的，在維持正當之生產事業，如辦理以後轉移於投機性之用途，反使信用膨漲，刺激物價，惟現已先辦轉押匯，各地廠商之轉口與出口貨，均可向三行兩居做押匯。銀錢兩業現有聯合準備會之組織，已足够同業間之週轉，如該會能力尙有不及時，該行自當出面維持，關於减低提存一事，該負責人謂：正與財政部商洽中，提存减少，決無問題，究竟减低若干·尙未決定。</p>
<h3>呉市長論　蔬菜豬肉不許漲價</h3>
<p>近來以蔬菜猪肉之漲價，漫無止境，市府特於昨日下午三時先後召集蔬菜鮮猪等兩業理事談話，計到蔬菜業同業張守仁，鮮猪業同業忻筱康等，由吳市長親自接談，先詢該兩業最近因何市價高漲，並說明市府澈底抑平物價之決意，當經各代表分別詳細陳述後，當經吳市長責成兩業公會趕速自動壓低市價，並將運銷情形，隨時報吿，如公會有力量未逮之困難發生，本人當竭力援助，如業中人有從中操縱龍斷之不法行爲，決依法嚴懲，尙望公會負責者特別注意，毋致後悔等語，各該業代表均表示通知全體會員遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>交行趙棣華氏建議　調劑工業長期資金組織復興實業公司</h3>
<p>交通銀行總經理趙棣華，曾於去歲倡導組織投資性之公司，最近我國工業，益陷於不景氣狀熊中，趙氏又重申此議，金融界人士咸認爲解救當前工業之危機，非有是項組織不可，特籌組復興中國實業金融公司，已擬定辦法，資本定爲美金五萬萬元及國幣五十億元，由國家銀行與商業銀行·　　公司·保險公司等認足，其中心業務爲工鑛各業，訂購國外機器材料，得請求該公司代爲辦理，公司按照其信用程度及所購機器材料之性質，分別酌收一成至三成　頭，發給信用狀，或代向國外接洽，分期付款或投資，代訂之機器材料到達時，應以原請代訂者，按照合同規定一次，或分期繳款爲原則，如力有未逮，該公司得酌量情形貸款墊付，新設之工鑛企業資金不　，得請求代爲籌集，或量予貸助，或由公司代向外商接洽投資或長期貸放，該公司凡代各廠礦向外國廠礦及投資；與金副界所作之擔保，該公司並擬請求政府向外國政府及人民，作全面無條件之擔保，以增厚公司在國外之信用。在外信用確立，如環境適宜時，得與外國洽商，在國外金融或證券市場，發行外幣實業債券，並悉：該公司爲應工礦各業所需國內長期資金之要求，兼顧國內資本之貧乏，得按廠礦實際需要，接受廠礦所發債券，或以廠基作抵，貸放長期國幣資金，趙氏謂美國在一九三〇年農業恐慌後，即有復興金融公司之組織，此次大戰結束，英國亦設立工商金融公司，吾人臨此嚴重關頭，應急起直追，希金融界同人合作，迅速組織，以挽救工業危機。</p>
<h3>再保險業務漸發展　中信局撥鉅資努力擴充期達到國際互保之目的</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕再保險業務之承辦，在今日之保險業務中，已佔極重要之地位。記者昨特趨訪中央信託局產物保險處，探詢承辦再保險業務情形。據悉：去年秋以戰爭尙在綿延期中，各項產物之價格，莫不日益飛漲。各保險公司以有限之資力，對價格過鉅之產物，竟致無法承保。即有承保，莫不均將保額分担一部份至國外各保險公司再保險。故外匯資金，耗用頗鉅。財政部有鑒及此，遂委託中央信託局於原有之普通保險業務外，復於去年九月四日，開辦再保險業務。目的在使各民間商業，能因此而得到實際之利益。同時可節省外匯之耗損。該局辦理再保險之資本，初創時爲十億元。後因業務日趨發展，本年四月間，已增資至五十億元。自去年九月迄本年六月底止，承辦各公司之再保險金額，已達一千四百八十餘億元。上項營業額範圍，僅指上海重慶兩地而言。該局近爲方便共他各埠之保險公司計，所有廣州·漢口·靑一島。天津等地分局，亦已於八月一日起，開始辦理再保險業務。</p>
<p>又據談：保險業務，原含有國際性質。按保險學之原理言，保額如分散愈火，則各公司所負　本亦愈低，危險亦愈小。在國　分保之觀點言，原則上應爲互惠性質。然按現時我國情形言，大部均由國內各保險公司分出，交國外各公司再保險，而鮮有自國外分入者，趨勢純係片面性質。故甚望因該局辦理再保險業務後，能發生一種領導之作用，會同國內各保險公司集體之力量，向國外各保儉公司交換分保，俾求眞正達到保險業務國際互惠之目的云。</p>
<h3>紡建謂無問題　棉的供給布的漲風</h3>
<p>日來華盛頓方面消息，美棉將立即增價，且有人主張在價格未予調整以前，棉花應暫禁出口者，據紡建公司某負責人詳吿，美棉即使在短期內立即增價，然與吾國毫無影響，其原因爲（一）吾政府向美國訂購之棉花，以定貨關係，價格早經載明協定，不能有所增减，（二）國內產棉情形大見好轉，故如一旦美棉絕跡，亦不致造成如何恐慌局面，至少本年內，美棉運華，可無　缺乏，此外聨總署亦時有大量棉花輸入，價格與定貨相差無幾</p>
<p>棉布漲風並無根據</p>
<p>關於日來棉布市場，突起漲風一節，渠解釋此係外間棉布商人，聞得此項信息後，認爲棉布出口足以造成供求縣殊狀態，故彼此競購，此風可能立即平息，以中紡出品將源源而來，並不因外銷政策而遭受打撃，　國產棉布能否於最短期內實施外銷一節，該發言人拒絕作正面表示</p>

<h3>上海唯一商用航空港龍華機場一瞥</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張蔭槐撰文　廷鵬攝影</p>
<p>作爲上海唯一商用航空港的龍華機塲，是在怎樣的一個狀態中，想爲各方所注目。滑走道崎嶇不平，塵埃隨處飛揚，機塲緊窄侷促，缺少機庫，是業務擴張上的巨大障碍，改進工作該是當前的急務。</p>
<p>當雙發動機旅客機怒吼着在五千呎長的跑道上疾駛的時候，機輪在高低不平的碎石路巔巔簸簸前進，拖起一陣濃烟似的塵　。北平的俗語「無風三尺土，一雨滿街泥，」竟也適用到這裏來·記者最近巡視了一次龍華飛機塲，並在機塲上空俯瞰，結果獲得了上述的一個印象。</p>
<p>旅客機教練機達五十架以上</p>
<p>二日上午十一時二十五分，記者等乘中央航空公司C．46型雙引擎旅客機升空，甫離地面，映入眼　的，便是擁擠的機場。記者俯視翼下的滑走道，左邊是中國航空公司與中央航空公司的機庫，右邊是正在籌劃中的大華航空公司·圍繞着機庫，前前後後停歇着各式大小不等的旅客機·敎練機，總數約在五十架以上。</p>
<p>那條五千呎長的滑走道，從五百呎上空窺望下去，呈現泥土的黃褐色。它約略成南北向，與一衣帶水的南黃浦江平行。飛機逐漸爬高，上升到六百五十呎高度，這時我在機中，只覺得平滑穩定，有時即使稍微有些跳動，也像坐在席夢思床上一般，有着彈性的舒軟感覺。記者很自然地聯想起剛才飛機起飛時在跑道上跳跳蹦蹦的情形，不禁爲之驚嘆！</p>
<p>航空發軔時期僅有史汀生機</p>
<p>龍華機塲在二十年前，還只是軍委會的陸軍操場。民國十八年，中國航空公司在那裏劃出了一片平地來，造幾間屋，買了幾架史汀生式的小型旅客機，這便是中國民用航空事業的發軔。那時、他們旣無電訊設備，亦無天空連絡，更無氣象台等機構。至於跑道，也只六百至八百米長。他們的所以選擇了黃浦江畔的場所。據說是爲了便利水上飛機的昇降。</p>
<p>歐亞航空公司場地擴充經過</p>
<p>兩年以後，中德合辦的歐亞航空公司成立了。塲地擴充了一些，跑道也增長到一千二百米。那時的航機，充其量不過是幾架DC－２型雙發動的旅客機，每次僅搭載乘客十六人，與今日動机戰客四五十人的情形一比顯然已有小巫見大巫之感。</p>
<p>八一三，戰火延燒到了上海，龍華機場落入了日寇之手。機場本身逢到了空前的膨脹，雖然並未添建機庫，但是跑道展長至五千餘公尺，原來只可停歇十餘架飛機的機場空地，開拓至可以容納百餘架重轟炸機，東西向的輔助滑走道，也添闢了好幾道。龍華機塲已經具備了航空港的雛型，至少它已具備了發展成商用航空港的條件。</p>
<p>兩公司復員後業務突呈蓬勃</p>
<p>勝利以後，中國航空公司遷滬復員，歐亞航空公司已於中國對德宣戰時，改組成功。完全國營性而歸交通部管轄的中央航空公司，於去年聖誕節前復遷滬營業</p>
<p>兩公司都購置了很多的美軍C—４６，C—４７，剩餘飛機。同時，由於政府積極復員，人民羣向上海集中，業務呈現了空前逢勃的氣象。</p>
<p>在兩公司密切合作之下，機場上也有昇降指揮塔。各公司也有了各自的電訊臺，向空中通話，或向各地航空站直接通報。主要航線增闢至六條，最遠者甚至通達西安與蘭州，西南方面通往昆明，可能延展至越南盤谷，香港線可能拓展至菲島。</p>
<p>一個巨大障礙迄未圓滿克服</p>
<p>但是，飛躍成長中的民用航空事業始終有一個最大的障礙無法克服。這就是說，在上海缺乏一個適宜的航空港。</p>
<p>上海五個機塲中，江灣可能比龍華更合適，但是龍華是航委會所指定的民用機塲。在軍用航空同樣需要急起直追的現時中國，商業機構似乎也就不便再望着江灣機塌遼闊的塲地，平滑廣直的三和土滑走道，妄想染指。龍華機塲上兩公司雖然在極力局部改進，使起飛或降落的旅客有個很舒服的環境，但這是無關宏旨的。</p>
<p>第一，跑道的不够平滑，這時公司本身也增加了修理機輪種種經常負担。第二，機庫缺少，五六十架寳貴的飛機盡由着在露天塲地上雨淋日晒。飛機的壽命便可能因而减低。</p>
<p>市府經濟困難無力修築機場</p>
<p>改良民用航空港，當然是市政當局的責任，但在市府行政經費入不敷出的時候，顯然還談不到修築機塲。市府因無經費暫時似亦不擬投身於此困人的問　中，（自然，這不過是暫時的）·遠在戰時，市府原向航空公司，按客票總收入百分比，收取稅項，今日關於此點，只能暫　不問。</p>
<p>聘有若干專家研究改進計劃</p>
<p>據悉：航空公司確曾聘請若干專家，研究改進能華機塲，使成爲一現代化航空港，聞該項計劃內容約分二點，詳情猶未達發表時期，當然他們極　留待機塲管　權問題明期化後再討論改　　劃的，如此，則權利與義務或可有一比較合理的決定。</p>
<p>關於龍華機塲土地所有權問題，也是千頭萬緒，如同亂髮。這裏面，由於二十年來的沿革，已不易分判產權之誰屬。其中，除民有而被　川者外，航委會及交通部俱有其一部分。今日市府方而，正擬蒐集資料，以便整理並解決此一懸案。</p>

<h3>上海市的排洩問題</h3>
<p>— 崔柳山</p>
<p>「排洩」一語，在生理學上包涵甚廣，本文則僅指糞便的排洩。</p>
<p>糞便的排洩，爲每人每日必不可免之事。排洩之後，倘若處理不當，則足影響生活，尤其在人口密集之大都市，糞便產量極鉅，其處理得法與否，關係異常重大。所以糞便與垃圾處理相似，爲市政上重要課題之一。糞便是討厭東西，也是危險東西。糞便中含有多量的有機物，此種有機物一經分解，便生穢氣。在攝氏十五度至二十度的氣溫中，一立方公尺的糞便，在二十四小時內，能發生穢氣十八立方公尺，其成分大概爲（一）揮發性脂酸與炭化氫一〇立方公尺，（二）一氧化炭六立方公尺，（三）氨二立方公尺，此種氣體，能使人精神不快·嘔吐·减少食慾，或甚至於直接中毒。糞一公撮含有微生物三億八千一百萬個。溺一公撮含有微生物二億，此等微生物，並非皆有毒害，但若糞便來源爲病體，則其中即常含有大量的病菌。例如傷寒·霍亂·赤痢等患者的糞便中，病菌充斥，此等疾病，即多因糞便而蔓延。此外尙有各種寄生蟲·如蛔蟲·鈎蟲·螩蟲·蟯蟲·肺蛭·肝蛭·旋毛虫·薑片虫等·其卵子散佈於糞溺等排洩物中·亦因糞便而傳染·</p>
<p>即此足見糞便之可厭與可怖。現在我們計算一下，上海全市有多少糞便？據伯頓科斐（Pettenkofer）估計，一人一年間排糞三四公斤，溺四〇〇公斤。準此，則上海三百四十萬人口，一年間出糞一一五·六〇〇噸，溺一·三六〇·〇〇〇噸，兩共一·四七五·六〇〇噸，平均每日四·〇四〇噸，如照過去法租界所用糞車每三車約合一噸計算，則上海市每日應運出糞便一二。一二〇車。如此鉅量之汚物，若使處理稍有不善，便足引起極大的困擾，或竟釀成極大的災害。</p>
<p>處理糞便步驟</p>
<p>處理糞便，通常可分下列幾個步驟：爲暫時的積儲，二爲收集及運送，三爲利用或銷毀。在分項討論之先，有兩點意思，須要說明。</p>
<p>第一，最理想的糞便處理辦法，是使用抽水馬桶，此即建築上的冲水裝置。此種裝置，自排便以後，糞便暴露空氣中之時間最短，汚穢不積，臭氣不揚，而且自地下直接輸至最後處理之所，即令無化　池之天然消毒，其病原菌亦絕無散逸的機會，所以是最合衛生原則的。不過，此刻上海的建築還很落後，多數房屋，沒有此種裝置。據佔計全市糞便由此方式處理者，僅佔六分之一。裝設糞管的地方，也有許多因管壁損壊，以致糞水外溢。而修理之責，則房東與房客，互相推諉，結果汚穢滿地，還成爲環境衛生上的一個問題。</p>
<p>第二，糞便可作肥料，因其化學成分包含氮，鉀及燐酸鹽類，能使土壤增肥。我國農業，習慣上對於糞便依賴甚深。據前江蘇省昆蟲局估計：全國一年所用糞便，價値二千萬元，照現在的幣値說，則爲八百億元以上。所以從另一觀點看來，此物又是一件「寳貨」。上海所產的糞便，此刻還是一車車一船船出賣的，收入數目很可觀；而四鄉農民，用此爲肥料，也可說是少牠不得。在這種情形之下，就應當對於糞便的積儲，糞便的搬運，和糞便利用的時期，要切實的依據公共衛生的條件來處理。</p>
<p>公用坑厠設置</p>
<p>現在先說積儲。積儲的衛生條件，第一要儘可能杜絕蠅類的飛集與蠅蛆的滋生；第二要儘可能使臭氣不發揚。欲達到這目的，必須選擇適當的地點，安排適當的設備，使用適當的容器，而最重要的一點，則爲勤加淸除。至於積儲的方式，在上海今日所用者，不外下列二種；私用多爲便桶，公用多爲坑厠。</p>
<p>公用坑厠之設置，在這樣一個大都市裏，當然是十分重要的。但是就市區計算，全上海僅有公厠二二五所，平均每〇·四二方公里有公厠一所。以市民往來之頻繁，與一般居戶衛生設備之缺乏而論，這數目實在不够。過去衛生局曾決定選擇相當地點，添建公厠二百所。在錢市長任內，因鑒於此項設施之急要，曾撥款一億元，以充建築公厠之用。此項計劃，如吿完成，則市區每〇·二二方公里可有公厠一所。公厠的添設，不僅便利市民的排洩，而且亦爲維持清潔所必需。</p>
<p>不過公厠問題很多。如果地點選擇得不好，結果或者不但無益於衛生，而且有害於衛生。其次，公厠的建築是一個問題，管理又是一個問題。上海市區，現有二二五所公厠，市政當局所設者，計一二〇所，其中多數設有沖洗裝置，在地點與建築方面，也能顧到衛生條件，例如對於流通空氣，排洩汚水等等，都有良好的設計。但私人所設者，情形便不同了。私人設公厠，目的在於收糞致財，旣不講究建築，復不注意淸除，往往糞溺滿地，不可插足，而便桶之中，積穢盈溢，至夏日則蠅類羣集，糞蛆四佈，不僅齷齪難堪，而且危險萬分·此等厠所，必須加以取締，至少亦須勒令改善，免爲致禍之源。</p>
<p>私立設公厠，我以爲在原則上應該予以鼓勵，因爲現在公厠不够，公家一時又不及添建許多。不過對於地點的選擇，建築的設計等等，必須經政府嚴格的審核，同時對於管理方面，也應該與公家坑厠一般注意。</p>
<p>管理公厠，第一要求勤於淸除，同時注意殺蛆滅蠅。此外，上海公厠中還有一樁草紙買賣，因其本輕利厚，所以有許多人競欲承包，另有許多人以爲營此者取利太高，主張加以限制或取消。我個人以爲取消最好；倘使一時不能取消，亦當限定其售價，莫使原意在於方便的事，結果竟有榨取的弊病。</p>
<p>糞便包運問題</p>
<p>其次。在搬運方面，也應當與積儲同樣的注意；尤其是搬運所用的車輛船隻等等運輸工具，要使牠嚴密的蓋閉，不能讓糞便任意的暴露。關於收運的管理，上海市區的糞便，截至去年僞政府解體時止，向來都是由商人承包的，政府按月依約收取「淸潔捐，」承包商人則派糞夫曳本車至各居戶收集糞便，運至糞碼頭，售與運糞船商，再由船商分銷至鄰近各地。</p>
<p>包運糞便，依偽政府解體時的情形來說，分爲幾個區域：浦東，吳淞，徐漕各成一區，舊租界，閘北（連江灣，）南市，滬西，（徐漕除外，）合成一區。後一區工作地面最廣，業務範圍也最大　計其日常淸除數量，佔全量百分之八十以上。此一區域平均每天出糞便六，五〇〇車，每車約三二噸，共爲二·〇八〇順。其包價在去年九月爲僞幣一〇一，七八六，〇〇〇元，合法幣五〇八，九三〇元。所有糞夫皆係包商以拆帳方式給予薪工；其所用工具（糞車），一部分爲包商所自有一部分則爲政府所置，而借與包商使用者。過去公共租界當局置有大批糞車，其存留至今者，計有九百餘輛，包商自有者約計一·二〇〇輛，總共約二千餘輛。</p>
<p>所有糞車，多數破損，因此推曳過市之際，往往糞穢淋漓，潑散路上。過去衛生局曾經積極督令修理，還不能完全修好，原因多在車身過於老舊，必須另添新車，方可有濟於事·此問題一。</p>
<p>糞夫運糞，原有一定時間，後因管理鬆弛，或因倒糞開始較遲，或因出糞量多而運糞車少，結果往往遲至中午，猶見糞車在鬧市中轆轆行過。過去衛生局規定：主要街道的收糞工作，必須在八點以前結束，其他較偏僻地區，則限於十點以前收車。但事實上還有一部分糞夫不能照規定做到。此問題二。</p>
<p>糞夫爲住戶倒糞，按月向住戶收取小費，歲時令節，並且還有所謂賞金，積沿成習，差不多牢不可破。此種小費，隨物價之增漲而增漲，過年過節，又常勒索鉅數，住戶不勝需索，因此頗多煩怨。這種陋規，當然需要改革，但改革並非一紙一令文所能辦到，必須有個統盤的計劃。此問題三。</p>
<p>在上海，倒糞已成爲一種特殊的職業。糞天聯結成帮，各人又分據傳統的地段，爲他人所不能侵越。譬如此一街內由甲糞夫倒糞，甲糞夫可以此傳之子孫，或售與他人，却不准任何方面另派一人共與其事。如果工作繁重，需用助手，亦由他自行僱用；倘有他人貿然加入，則不獨原佔該地段者不允，而且全體同行均不承認。同行彼此呼應，對於一般居戶以及綜攬此項業務的承包商人，往往以罷倒罷運爲要挾。此問題四。</p>
<p>此等問題，一部分關係於經費與人事，大部分關係於整個的制度。我對於承包制度，一向抱懐疑的態度，以後承乏上海市環境衛生工作，更從各方面發見此種制度的許多弊病，最後得到一個結論，就是我以爲我們要把上海的糞便處理辦好，必須從改革包商制度做起。（下接第九版）</p>

<h3>關於修路的兩件事</h3>
<p>最近本報接獲讀者來函兩件，均與修築道路事有關，當即轉函市工務局詢問，茲已得復；併錄各函如次；</p>
<p>滬閔路修理草率　編者先生：　滬閔公路自漕河涇至江蘇省立上海中學之一段，於勝利後，因該中學內住有英美僑民集中營，盟軍爲探訪戚友便利往返起見，特派平路機修理，大約工作二十日左右，修得路面平坦，一若柏油路。人民經過，均驚羨機械力量之偉大。惟目前路面又吿損壊，市工務局曾派平路機修理，工作僅二三日，即吿完竣，但路面仍崎嶇不平，碎石滿路。人民經過，皆曰：同樣機械修路，所得成績不同，中國人永遠做不好。（侍凡）</p>
<p>捐資築路被拆毁　編者先生：敝處之弄口行人道上，年久失修，高低不平，雨後汚水積聚，受日光蒸晒，臭氣難聞。、近由熱心者發起捐資修築，衆皆讚成，遂僱工修理。不料甫經工竣，便有工人模樣者數人，擬自手拆毁。當時居民詢其因何拆毁，回說是你們未得工務局許可，不能擅自修築。隔了幾天，該批拆路者手持公文，會動警察而來，並有一上級人員領導。經居民懇求後，答應暫緩執行，着即具文請求工務局核准，便可不用拆毁。隔日拆路者復來，聲言局裏已發出之命令，不能收回，勢非執行不可，遂將路面全行毀掉而去。請問這是何故？（畏壽路四六八九弄一居民敬上）</p>
<p>市工務局答復</p>
<p>（一）查漕河經至江蘇省立上海中學，係屬滬閔公路之一段。現該路尙未劃歸本市管轄，本局亦從未派工修理，童君所謂市工務局派平路機修理一節，當係誤會。（二）査本局代辦工程暫行辦法，早經呈准公佈施行。依照該辦法第二條規定，凡公共道路及公弄之路而人行道如有損毁，槪應報請本局修復，如係因私人各種設施以致破壊，其修復工程，亦應申請本局代辦不得自行辦理。該長壽路四六八九號弄居民卽未遵照規定，向本局報告申請，即　自修復。及經本局察覺，由第十三工段派員通知補具手續，又延不照辦，究竟該人行道是否因年久失修損毁，事後已無從證明，且私人修築，其工程標準，亦難與本局規定悉合ˇ該工段根據該辦法第八條之規定派工拆除·實係遵章辦理·嗣後希望市民加以注意，以免誤會。</p>

<h3>台灣選拔人才</h3>
<p>— 本報七月十八日航訊　特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣省的人事政策，是扶植合胞，使自己能負起責任來，辦理台省行政，當局是這樣做，可是仍有人認爲處長階級的官員沒有讓台胞担任，而對於當局表示不滿，其實當局是有苦衷的，因爲在目前台胞還不能達到任務。</p>
<p>陳長官在某一個集會上，特別提出這個問題，他說：</p>
<p>「我們大家要注意爲台灣建設第一級的行政人才，在台灣，這種優秀人才，只要心誠求之，自然會發見的。凡智能高强，度量寬大而有抱負的，應該給予機會，使他做副處長。倘處長赴京，也可同去，這樣不但使他瞭解本省實情，而且可認識全國政情。幾年以後，木省第一級人才，就可培養成功了。」接着他說：「我們不如此誠心誠意地努力扶植，本省人永遠不能做第一級官吏，要是我們是本省人，也要感覺不滿的。」</p>
<p>對於一般機關，他極力主張多用技術人員，少用行政人員。他說：「如果大批普通公務人員再邀約來台，財政上受不起這重壓了！」</p>
<h3>認識高山同胞</h3>
<p>散處在台灣省境內的高山族同胞，勝利以前是由日本人給予嚴格的管理和日用品的配給，勝利後他們恢復了自由，享受了人的權利，可是這自由權利，對沒有受過現代敎育偏處在深山的角落裏的十三萬原始民族，只顯着不關痛攁，他們感謝於日本人的小惠，而決沒想到要感謝賦予自由，平等。</p>
<p>這個民族，最近半年來有些地万已顯得不穩，在高雄縣旗山區的高山民族，因對高雄的政令發生誤會分向台東，台中遷社，其他地方雖然還未見事實，但正醞釀着對政府不關心底不滿。所以當局除由民政處設法發給二萬一千餘件織維織物，救濟分署發給救濟品外，當局已決定在山區設立雜貨店，並以提高百分之二十到五十的待遇，鼓勵到高山去的行政敎育工作者。陳長官說：「在高山地方辦合作社是行不通的，還是由貿易局負責計劃開雜貨店，由高山同胞做經理，不要太賺錢，尤其要避免榨取。」他引用前日總督安藤利吉的話「高山族在南洋作戰勇敢活躍而富榮譽心，是個好民族，可惜日本人不曾認識他們」，說：「日本人沒有認識而覺後悔，現在我們不能再錯了！」</p>
<h3>財政陷於困境</h3>
<p>台省從前各縣市的支出達十三億元，而收入僅二億元，這個太大的差額，經財處一面撥劃稅源，改從量計稅爲從價計稅，一面　節開支，現在已保持了平衡，可是實際上仍發生着困難。日本人的會計年度三月份結束，四月開始，四，五，六三個月是整理期，不收稅，調整以前收入，不够開支，田賦征實要八月開始，而稅捐占省總收入百分之十九，約三億元，現經整理後增收二，三倍，　　還是有限的，而百分之八十靠公營事業，目前這就成爲問題。鐵路每天虧本一百萬元，郵電增價後還是虧本甚大，所以目前雖是靑黄不接，而長此下去，也未可樂觀。台灣沒有呈現通貨膨脹的，因爲有凍結的日款六億元，和台灣銀行有十三，四億元，可以運用，各縣市均鬧窮，發不出薪，台銀沒辦法借支，只有責令各單立自已多想辦法了。</p>
<p>陳長官說：「現在公營事業的漲價、好像大逆不道的事，這種思想、必須革除。」</p>
<h3>教師考績標準</h3>
<p>小久以前，　務處以取締無票　車、兒童吃烟及坐公家汽車上學等作爲警察人員重要考成之一，最近關於敎育方面又有新的考績標準。</p>
<p>在台灣，各階　都發生着普遍的現象，就是本省人和外省人之間的齟齠。台灣籍和外省籍的小學生也時常發生打架情事，種弱的心田，發生彼此惡感的根芽。</p>
<p>陳長官說：兒童相打，正是敎師們機會敎育的實騐時期，可以乘此機會施以敎育。以後小學校長或敎師的考績，可以小學生相打事件次數的多　，以定優劣！」</p>
<p>這是特殊化的台　底特殊事情。</p>
<h3>取締無聊小報</h3>

<h3>湘政的輪廓</h3>
<p>— 本報一日長沙訊　特派員高元禮</p>
<p>湖南省政府爲撿討省政，經規定本年行政會議，分長沙南岳沅陵三區舉行，長沙區行政會議於七月廿二日開幕，廿八日閉幕，會期七天，參加會議的共計廿二縣，雖只有湖南全省三分之一，但在這一會議裏，不難看出湖南目前省政的輪廓。</p>
<h3>游勇散兵打家刦寨</h3>
<p>湖南在大戰以後，加以災情慘重，二年來省府主席一再易人，在行政效率上，不能不承認要遭受到影響，以致於許多要政都沒有推行，尤其是王主席抵任後宣佈的「救災第一」口號，於是專員縣長幾乎是全力在「救災」上下工夫。</p>
<p>「災」救了半年多，秋收又大有希望，在省政府的立塲上說，災情可望渡過，自然政治的目標亦應該轉向，因此王主席在行政會議裏宣布，本省的施政方針，應由「救災第一」改爲「治安第一」·政治的轉向，自係針對現實，省主席旣然提出「治安第一」的口號，那地方治安當然有些問題，一年來，駐湘的國軍紛紛他調，防務空處，而在戰爭期間留下的一批散兵游勇，遂乘時而起，打家刦寨之事，時有發生，而素爲匪徒出沒的湘西山地，更變本加厲，加以奸匪活動的結果，僅以長沙一縣來說，復員以來，已捕奸匪五十七名，自苜者四千一百名，而未自首者爲數仍多，他如平江，瀏陽·臨湘·湘潭，莫不呈現社會不安，盜匪橫行的現象，這種情形，若再放任下去，則湖南在大災之後，再綴之以大亂，眞會走到總崩潰的路上，王主席在會議上並指出分區負責勦辦的辦法（一）縣境有匪，由縣長負責勦滅，（二）兩縣交界有匪由專員負責勦滅，（三）兩行政區邊界有匪由警務處負責勦滅，並旦認爲治本的辦法，還是要「政治勦匪」，而對縣鄕鎭今後工作提出四項基本要求，（一）安定地方秩序，（二）革除非法　派，（三）修整縣鄕道路，（四）整理倉儲塘壩。</p>
<h3>人員太少效率不大</h3>
<p>這是長沙行政會議的大題目，可是這問題提出以後，縣長們的反應如何呢，槪括的說，不外三個要求，一人，二權，三錢，本來縣政府的衙門小，負責任最大，應做的事也最多，可是人員過少，會影饗行政效率，但是本年第五次省府常會所通過的湖南省政府縣鄕政治機構調整辦法，對各縣人員曾大大的縮减，因此各縣長在會議席上紛紛提出異議，要求增加，但王主席的答覆是調整的辦法，是配合實際的需要，而定的標準，他舉四川爲例，四川的一等縣只有六十八人，湖南的一等縣竟有七十八人，認爲人是够用，問題是能力够不够。因此健全人事最重要，而鄉鎭長的任用，更應提高水準，來盡力推行地方自治，來提高行政效率。</p>
<h3>權的問題討論熱烈</h3>
<p>「權」的問題，確是値得注意的事，以省政府提出的勦匪問題爲例，縣長們深深感到左右爲難·禁止鄉鎭公所用槍丁，本來是對的，因爲那些槍丁，只會　老百姓，而是人民最討厭的東西，也是怨恨的媒介物，但是一且有了匪，沒有槍，沒有兵，難道叫縣長和縣府裏的職員赤手空拳去打嗎？縣雖有警察局，鄕雖有警察派出所，但派出所是否能受鄕公所的指揮，因爲警察派出所是鄕鎭編制以外的。</p>
<p>縣市田糧處和稅捐徵收處的隷屬問題，也是値得令人注意的事，財政收支系統改訂後，縣級財政較有辦法，但稅收機關不歸縣府指揮監督，自然要受掣肘，而且縣田糧處長在過去是虧了就逃之夭夭，害得縣長有苦訴不出，而且縣旣爲自治單位，賦稅應予自主才合理，這問題經過熱烈討論後，決定建議中央將田賦稅捐合併爲賦稅徵收處，隸屬縣政府，自卅六年元月實行，而人事由財廳委派，這樣省與縣的賦稅都加大了，縣的活動能力也許會因此加强。</p>
<h3>經費短絀應付困難</h3>
<p>「錢」的問題，更是天下　長都感困難的問題。上面說過，縣長負的責任最大，應做了的事最多。但無錢還是辦不通做不到，財政收支系統改訂施行，縣級經費的困難，雖已解決，但省級還是困難，而國稅停撥，靑黄不接的臨時救濟辦法，更是縣級最注意的事，湖南本年度一至六月份奉撥國稅十六億五千萬元，陸續分配各縣後，仍然是感到匱乏，財政廳擬訂的臨時救濟辦法三項，（一）已舉辦積榖平羅縣份，得借用積榖平　價款，（二）未辦積榖平　縣份，得借用積榖，（三）旣無積榖可借，又無積榖價款可資挪用縣份，經商洽省銀行轉飭各分支行處，作短期透支。但是湖南經八年戰亂，有積穀的縣份，實在太少，而省銀行的力量，是否應付裕如，亦令人懷疑。</p>
<h3>政治清明繫於縣級</h3>
<p>政治的淸明進步，全部寄託在縣級，而地方自治的完成，更是中央十年來推行的中心，但是一般忽視了它的矛盾，民廳長劉千俊指出推行政令的客觀矛盾，和政府本身的矛盾，他說人民愛散漫，自由，而政府要加以組訓，人民要自私荀免，而政府要征夫征工征　，這是客觀的矛盾，政府要訓練人民行使四欋，又慮人民權能不淸，予以干涉，事實上要發動民力，完成建設，但又怕傷財傷力，組織民衆，又怕民衆團體力量反對，這是政府本身的矛盾。</p>
<p>旣然存在的矛盾如此，而縣政府的「權」『錢』「人」始終得不到合理的解決，又如何能做事？這次長沙區行政會議對上述三件事得一個初步的解決，也許今後的湖南政治可以走上正軌。</p>
<h3>上海市的排洩問題</h3>
<p>接第八版</p>
<p>包商制度之弊</p>
<p>包商制度，對於行政當局說來，一則可以省事，二則在收入方面，按時有固定的數目可計，是其好處。但弊端却也不少。而且我認爲此項工作之不能進步，多半受此種制度的影響。</p>
<p>此種制度之成立與維持，大概是由於負責當局嫌齷齪，怕麻煩。即此已在根本上表現出一種要不得的惰性。我常說，我們幹衛生工作，沒有別的，只是要把齷齪變成乾凈，把衰弱變成健康。要對付齷齦，便須正視齷齪，萬不能抱躲避的態度。</p>
<p>况且糞便之爲物，一方面大家討厭牠，寗願賠幾文錢，將它棄去；另一方面却也有人把它看成「寳貨」，按着時値購買。承包商人就利用了這樣的一種矛盾，牟取很大的利益。如果政府當局能够不假手於中間商人，那末這利益便可歸政府所得。</p>
<p>說到此處，我願提出一點事實，就是有許多人把包糞看成好買賣，千方百計的想取得包商的地位。許多人以爲能在衛生局底下做個糞包商，立刻就可以變成鉅富。此種算盤打的切實麼？照過去情形說來，可說是切實的。最初租界當局，對於糞便，只求搬走了事，所以取價極低；其後此種態度未改，對於糞便包價，一直不作深切的計較；到了戰爭期間，幣値波動得很厲害，物價漲了，糞價也漲了，但承包商所繳的「淸潔捐」，因爲在契約上訂定數目，並不隨時增漲。有此二種原因，豈不是包糞到手便可發財？正因爲發財容易，所以就有人利用勢力，以達到承包的目的。過去的「糞大王」，人人皆知由包糞而成富翁，而「糞大王」之取得包糞權，又人人皆知乃是憑了特殊勢力而得的。</p>
<p>記得去年衛生局接收偽政府各項業務之後，爲了包糞的事情，曾經受到多方面的威脅和利誘。因此更使當時的負責者注意這問題，特別的加以研究，研究的結果，確認只有由公家自辦，才是最公正最合理的辦法。於是就在三月八日的市政會議上，通過了收回市辦的案子。可是即在這時候，也還有人以衙門不宜管齷齪事爲理由，反對市辦的建議。當時兪局長力關此種觀念，指明公共衛生的任務，是剷除齷齪，愈是齷齪的地方，愈需要衛生機關的努力。這一點，其實不僅是兪局長的信念，凡是懂得公共衛生的人，都是應該這樣想的。</p>
<p>再從經濟意義來說，「糞大王」發了財，反過來就是政府受了損失。包商爲加重利潤，難免對于農民抬高糞價，或作居奇之舉。糞夫管理不良，糞便走漏很大，而且常有倒入陰溝的事。這是一種損失。所以講「利用的經濟」，包商制度亦要不得。</p>
<p>官辦勝於商辦</p>
<p>廢除包商制度，即是由政府直接辦理。政府直接辦理，比之招商承辦，容易解決上述幾項問題。例如關于工具方面，包商僅圖一時厚利，不作久遠之計，自然不肯多花本錢；如由政府自辦，可由贏利中撥出相當數目，隨時整理添置。關干夫役管理方面，如果行政力量能够貫澈到下層，袪除一切隔膜與蒙蔽，則種種惡習，自可逐漸打破，合理的收運制度，就此逐漸建立。此種除舊布新的功夫，絕不可能期成於唯利是圖的商人，只有由政府立定方針，統盤籌劃，權衡利害，逐步施行，然後方能做到。上文說過，糞夫聯結成幫，不易應付。說句老實話，對于此等夫役，其生活上的要求，我們必須顧及；不過他們習慣上許多不合理的地方，必須用合理的手段，一一加以改革。譬如過去衛生局十分注意限定收運時間的問題，多方督促，結果發現這問題關聯到工具數量，地段分配，以及糞夫人數等等間題。此中不合理的地方太多，但爲顧全事實，却不得不用合理的方法，來施行解決。而要達到解決的目的，我們相信，不用政府力量而僅求之於包商是不行的。</p>
<p>再說在財政方面，政府的收入，官辦必遠勝于商辦。因爲在理論上，官辦可免除商人中飽，即取商人的贏利歸之于公。論事實，衛生局在上年十月底接管永大公司，十一月起，即將原由永大經營的　便業務，改爲官商合辦，計其收入：十月份永大所繳「淸潔捐」爲五〇八，九五〇元，十一月份，即官商合　的第一月，即增收至九·七三四，三三〇元。自本年四月份起，實行政府自辦，收入益形增加，至六月初，每日收入達一千一百餘萬元。當時衛生局計劃利用此項淸潔業務的收入，添置各種急要的工具，以使此一業務逐步改進。</p>
<p>有人說，官辦的事業辦不好，這是一種武斷，一種成見。我對此無須多辯，只要看事實就是了。並且我以爲只要我們相信政府的效能，相信政治有上進的希望，而且正在上進途中，那末，此種見解，便不能立足。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個嚴重的問題，辦公共衛生的人很少注意得到的，就是糞便利用的時期問題。在我國過去和現在，都是任憑農人把新鮮的糞便運到鄕間去，直接就作爲施肥的用途，從來沒有見到把這種新鮮的糞便經過一個合理的時間，再去利用的事。所以像傷寒，霍亂，痢疾和寄生虫等等的疾患，不斷的循環傳染。這是多麼的危險和多麼嚴重的一個問題。此一問題解決不易，但欲求其解決，亦唯取政府自辦的方式方可。</p>
<p>消除一切積弊</p>
<p>由上所述，可以概見糞便問題性質的嚴重與上海糞便處理問題內容的複雜。我主張由政府自辦糞便業務，以代替包商制度；現在政府已經自辦了我主張繼續積極的辦下去。在政府直接管理之下，過去許多積重難返的弊病，必可逐漸消除。</p>
<p>我們不希望市政機關永遠爲收運糞便費事。我們希望市政進步，這進步的方向，在糞便處理上，是逐漸使大家都用抽水馬桶，即房屋建築上都有冲水裝置，使所有糞便，自地下直接輸至最後處理之所。如此不獨無須費收運之勞，在衛生上說來，亦可避免病菌散佈的危險了。</p>
<p>現在謠傳本市的衛生當局要把糞便處理這一類的絕對有關公共衛生的工作，劃歸衛生局以外的機關去辦理，衛生界的同人聽了以後，無一不爲本市市民的健康擔心。我希望主持本市衛生的人員和負市政責任的當局，要在事先多多加以研討。要知道我們中國人的衛生知識，幷不是像外國每一個人都有深切了解，衛生的一切設施，都是像外國那樣完備。假使把這一類絕對屬於公共衛生部門的清潔工作，劃歸到衛生機關以外的機構去辦理，那些擔任這種工作的各級人員，衛生知識是否够格，一切的一切是否能够措置裕如，換句話說，能否免除處理不當的危險，而影響到市民的健康，這一點希望加以深長的考慮！</p>

<h3>怎樣防治脚癬？</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>脚癬的防治新論</p>
<p>脚癬的病原是癬菌，所以無論是預防或治療，均須致力於癬菌的撲滅。</p>
<p>癬菌是很普通的微生物，就是沒有脚癬病的脚和鞋襪内也往往有其存在。有脚癬病的病人在發病的時候自然含有特別多的癬菌，就是在不發病的時候，癬菌還是存在。這種癬菌的繁育，需要高溫與潮濕，所以一到夏季，因爲氣溫與濕度之合於癬菌繁育條件，潛伏在脚上和鞋襪内的癬菌便大大活動，極易侵襲脚部皮膚而發病。香港地方又熱又潮濕，脚癬特別流行，香港脚一病名，即由此而來。</p>
<p>要防治脚癬必須撲滅癬菌，因爲癬菌不僅生存在脚的皮膚表面，在發病的時候，也侵襲到皮膚裏面，除皮膚而外，鞋與襪的裏面自然也有許多癬菌，所以我們的對象有二，即脚部與鞋襪是也。</p>
<p>鞋襪的消毒</p>
<p>有脚癬的病人往往每夏必發，如欲預防其復發，必須將自己用過的鞋襪通統消毒，以撲滅其遺留的癬菌。</p>
<p>機子與布鞋均可於洗凈後加水煮沸消毒之。皮鞋之消毒較屬麻煩，可按下法行之。</p>
<p>一·用水與肥皂充分洗凈鞋之內部；</p>
<p>二·用乾布充分擦乾之；</p>
<p>三·用脫脂棉在鞋內平舖一薄層；</p>
<p>四·向藥房購蟻醛溶液（Formali）少量，加水十倍稀釋之，用時取稀液傾鞋内棉花上，每鞋約一茶匙（約四西西）；</p>
<p>五·置加藥之鞋於紙匣内，蓋緊後再外用紙包裹之，以减少其洩氣；如此消毒至六小時；</p>
<p>六·將鞋取出而棄去其内之一薄層棉花，將鞋置通風處吹二十四小時；</p>
<p>七·上鞋油後即可取用。</p>
<p>脚部衛生</p>
<p>鞋襪消毒必須與脚部消毒互相配合行之，否則將消毒之鞋襪穿於未消毒之脚，或將已除去癬菌之脚穿入未行消毒之鞋襪，其結果仍等於完全未行消毒。</p>
<p>脚部已將癬症治好後，須用肥皂與熱水充分洗凈之，擦乾後用硼酸滑石粉（硼酸粉十份與滑石粉九十份混和而成），輕擦全脚，於脚底與趾間尤宜多擦。擦後即穿入消毒過之鞋襪。</p>
<p>每逢夏季將臨，即應每晚洗脚，洗後如法用粉，早晨穿鞋前應再加粉一次。</p>
<p>最近有主張改用丙酸鈉以代硼酸粉者。丙酸鈉（Sodium　Propionate）一份，加滑石粉九十九份混和即成。丙酸鈉爲最近發現之殺滅癬菌藥物，其効力甚强，亦用於脚癬之治療。</p>
<p>漂白粉溶液曾於十年前一度廣用爲脚浴之用，具撲殺癬菌之効，凡公共游泳池及學校洗澡房內，多採用此種脚浴設備，任何人入池或入浴前均須將脚浸入此水少時，以防帶入癬菌而致脚癬病之流行。今知此種脚浴之効力並不可靠，而且於實用上並無價値。</p>
<p>治療藥物</p>
<p>治療脚癬的藥物很多，但是到現在為止，還沒有一種特效藥。並且因爲脚癬各期症狀，大不相同，對於甲期有效的藥物，並不對於他期亦有效，有時反有害處。目前坊間所售各種脚癬藥水，或濕氣藥膏，沒有一種可由病人可靠地用來自療脚癬的。</p>
<p>這一類的藥水藥膏，大都含有柳酸和安息香酸，富有刺激性；對於慢性的病症確有相當療效，但對急性症往往不僅毫無療效，反易激起炎症。此外，碘酒，紅藥水或紫藥水（主要成分係龍胆紫）等也有撲殺癬菌的效力，但是也有刺激性，一樣的不妥當。七八年前在美國流行的一種酚與樟腦混合劑，亦因易致刺激性炎症而被專家攻擊，不久即行銷聲匿跡。近來流行的磺胺類藥物，如消治龍（磺胺咪唑）之類，亦往往製成油膏以治脚癬，更有引起過敏現象的危險。這種過敏現象一且產生，將來如有必要再應用此類藥物時，不論内用外用，均能引起反應，其猛烈者有致命的危險。這點將來當另文討論之。</p>
<p>最近發現多種脂肪酸如丙酸Propionil　acid），庚酸（Caprylic　acid）與癸甲酸（Undecylenic　acid）等製劑，對於癬菌有强大之殺滅能力，且無刺激性，在美國漸見廣用。又一新療法係用氯化乙烷（Ethyl　Chlorice）噴射病部，至局部皮膚冷至發白爲止，其效亦佳。氯化蘇溶液（Cadmium　chloride）亦被試用，云有良效。</p>
<p>病人自療，以採用前述之硼酸滑石粉爲佳。對於普通輕症，甚爲有效，且亦安全，無引起炎症之危險。其用法胖脚部衛生項下。一旦局部發炎化膿，即應投醫求治，不可怠忽。</p>
<p>·注意要點·</p>
<p>一·洗脚宜勤，每日至少一次，洗後必須換襪。脚汗多者，尤宜多洗多換。</p>
<p>二·鞋子宜擇通風吸汗者。夏季宜避用膠底鞋。</p>
<p>三·夏季宜備鞋數雙，每日上下午各換一次。換下之鞋，須置通風處。</p>
<p>四·切忌扳脚丫與捏脚等惡習，以免局部損傷及傳佈病毒至他處。</p>
<p>五·切忌與他人合用鞋子，勿用公共處所之拖鞋。</p>
<p>六·赴公共游泳池或浴室者，每次事畢宜注意冲洗脚部，並撒用硼酸滑石粉。</p>
<h3>脚癬淺說</h3>
<p>— 蔡君平</p>
<p>脚癬是一種最普通的疾病，俗稱「香港脚」，多起於脚趾間。一般人認爲是「濕氣」·不足重視。而且反以爲「濕氣」存在，適足以减少其他體肉病害。此種見解實在完全錯誤，錯誤原因係對於病情之不了解。錯誤一傳再傳，使病情爲人所輕視，以致常常引起嚴重後果。厲害時候不能行走，須要臥床治療，無異其他重症。患者到此時方求醫診治，實已吃虧不少。</p>
<p>脚癬是種皮膚傳染病。由於空氣中癬菌或其他有癬菌病患者之用品接觸而來。部位不限於脚上，癬菌亦不止一種，脚上所以多見，有其適合之條件，脚癬稱爲「香港脚」，可見多發生在溫暖而水份充足的地方；而兩足常爲鞋襪包圍，熱天脚汗增加，熱氣不易發散。兩者正合於癬菌之繁長侵害，造成脚癬。有時乎，指甲以及軀幹同時成因此而傳染，範圍更大。癬菌分佈於各處，空氣中亦有，其傳染猶如細菌。一般人對於細菌已稍具幾分害怕心理，加以防範，對於癬菌，則因爲不知其嚴重性，不知注意。癬菌繁殖極快，且須極高溫度方能殺滅之，普通消毒劑及低溫度根本不生影響。所以凡癬菌患者之用品必須分開，特別與癬菌部位有直接接觸者。</p>
<p>脚癬可分急慢性兩種。急性脚癬常被誤認爲「濕氣」，因爲確有很多水份排出，尤以摩擦止痒後爲然。足趾邊緣及足兩旁小水泡很多，痒特甚，皮膚發紅。慢性脚癬最普通，而不爲人所重視：足趾間略潮潤，表皮發白，或有剝脫；足底及足背，皮膚變亁而厚，間有裂縫，此種病情固極普通，無須醫生，患者自能診斷。</p>
<p>單純脚癬因爲常被忽視，時有不良之後果發生，茲就常見者略舉一二：（一）脚趾甲極易變灰白而厚。如傳至手上，手指甲亦發生同樣變化。在美觀立塲言，是很不好的。（二）皮膚經癬菌優害後，其抵抗力降低；同時皮膚經搔痒後有小破裂，容易爲皮膚表面之化膿細菌所侵襲，發生淋巴腺管炎或丹毒等感染。病情是股淋巴腺腫痛，股内側發生紅綫，或者脚背或足踝部起游走性紅腫且痛，全身發熱發冷。此時患者步行困難，非睡倒不可。此種病情並不少見。（三）如果常有丹毒或類似丹毒之感染發生。腿及脚可以成象皮腫，俗稱「大脚膀」，不問他病理如何，無論患者或旁觀者都有不良感覺。（四）某種細菌自癬處侵入血中過多，可以造成菌血現象，病情嚴重，甚至喪身。上面所舉不過一端。單就脚癬本身而言，急性者妨礙行動，躭誤工作，公共機關中，工人不能上工，學生不能上課。</p>
<p>所以脚癬雖然是一種小病痛，然而有其普遍性及嚴重性，不容忽視。防止方法，在儘量隔絕癬菌；已有傳染者，當防止其發展。公共塲所，如不潔的浴室游泳池等，最好不去。即在淸潔的浴室或游泳池中，也應當用自備的毛巾，浴後游後並用淸水淋過擦乾。平日必須時常替換鞋襪，兩脚保持淸潔，保持乾燥，切忌摩擦捏脚等壞習慣。</p>
<h3>保健牙齒</h3>
<p>— 石溪</p>
<p>牙齒是飲食的主要器官之一，他的完整與否，對人體的健康有很大的關係。我們切不可因牙齒事小而不加注意，以致影響我們身心整個的健全。</p>
<p>鈣，是構成牙齒的主要成份，嬰孩在母胎時，便大量吸取母體内的鈣質，以作生長骨骼之需。因此西人有「多生一個子，多落一個齒」的諺語。孕婦應多吃含鈣的食物，以免牙齒受損，亦因此故。</p>
<p>當牙齒咀嚼食物時，每有食物餘渣，遺附牙磁之上，如不洗凈，易生酸化作用，損傷整個牙齒。所以，我們如要保護牙齒，食後務須漱口刷牙。此外，還須注意到牙齒的營養：</p>

<h3>貧血與補血藥（下）　（五）紅血球生產的基本原料</h3>
<p>— 張昌紹</p>
<p>紅血球係血紅素（Hemoglobin）與基質（Stroma）兩部組成。這兩種成分都能由身體自己製造，而不斷產生新的血球，以補充正常的損失與不過度的非常損失。每種成分的製造均需要一種基本原料。任何一種原料缺乏的時候，均能影響紅血球的新生機能而招致貧血。</p>
<p>製造基質的基本原料，據最近的報告，恐怕就是肝製劑中的主要成分，就是所謂補血系（Hematinic　Principle）的成分。補血素缺乏的時候，便產生一種足以致命的惡性貧血（Pernicious　Anemia）。這種貧血的特徵是紅血球形體特別巨大，且含高量的血紅素，所以也叫巨型血球性貧血（Macrocyti　Anemia）。肝製劑對於這種貧血具有特效，鐵劑則無用處。在肝製劑發明以前，惡性貧血乃不治之症，病者愈發愈重，終至喪生。肝製劑的發明，拯救了不少生命</p>
<p>鐵乃製造血紅素的基本原料，血紅素本身就是鐵與蛋白質的化合物，自然，蛋白質也是重要原料，但因食物中含之甚富，取給甚便，除饑餓者外，不虞匱乏，故實際上並不重要。鐵則不然，食物含鐵甚少，對於正常之需要，尙能勉强應付，一旦需要激增，即感不敷，而致貧血。這種貧血的特徵在紅血球的形體特別微小，所含血紅素量較正常爲低，所以也叫做小型血球性貧血（Mcirocyict　Anemia）。</p>
<p>惡性貧血即在歐美各國亦屬不常見之病症，在中國則更屬罕見，彷彿鳳毛麟角，普通開業醫生一生中難得一見。普通所見之貧血病例幾全部屬於小型血球性，其特效藥爲鐵，肝製劑雖極名貴，可說毫無用處。所以對於普通貧血，無論預防也好，治療也好，鐵是最重要的藥劑，也可以說是唯一的特效藥劑。</p>
<p>（六）惡性貧血在中國旣然如此少見，所以吾人討論到補血藥，可以毋庸考慮肝製劑。因此鐵劑與補血藥二詞，實際上便成一而二，二而一的同義詞。一切補血藥如缺了鐵質，便喪失了補血的療效。</p>
<p>近年來由原子能研究而製成種種同位異質元素（Isotopes)，在醫學上廣用爲研究工具。自一九三八年起，鐵的同位異質元素即放射性鐵（Radio－iron）曾應用於種種實騐，對於鐵劑之藥理多所闡明。</p>
<p>吾人全身所含的錫不過四公分左右，約相當於二寸的洋釘一只。差不多體內全部的鐵都用來製造血紅素。成人男子每日約需鐵五—八公絲以補充正常之損失。婦女則因經期內血液之損失，其需要最約二—四倍於是。兒童因發育關係·需鐵量更多，體重每公斤約需織〇·六公絲。姙縟期内每日需要鐵量約爲二十公絲。</p>
<p>含鐵較多之食物係紅色之肉類，卵黄，綠色菜類特別是菠菜。人乳和牛乳中合鐵極少，所以哺乳兒易得貧血，須用菜汁或果子汁等補充之。粗麵粉與糙米中所含之鐵，較細麵粉與白米爲多。鷄鴨血與猪牛血之含鐵量，在一切食物中爲最高。吾國普通飲食中所含之鐵量相當高，儘够普通的生理需要。用鐵鍋烹飪者，尙有額外之鐵分混入食物中。但對於貧血病人，則食物中所含之鐵量遠不足以應治療的需要，必須採用鐵劑以補救之。</p>
<p>過去對於鐵劑之價値有種種錯誤之見解，必須加以糾正。鐵劑之藥理已於拙著之現代治療學一八七—一九一面内詳加討論，茲摘述數點如下：</p>
<p>（一）各種鐵劑，自鐵鍋與洋釘之鐵分以至複雜的有機鐵劑，作用完全相同，亦均可用作補血藥。</p>
<p>（二）有機鐵之吸收不如無機鐵之容易，所以其價格雖遠較簡單之無機鐵爲貴，其治療價値，反遠不如後者之佳。</p>
<p>（三）無機鐵劑中亞鐵鹽較鐵鹽爲佳，因較易吸收故也。</p>
<p>（四）效力最佳之藥劑係價格最賤之硫酸亞鐵，戰前價格每日量不過一二分錢，現在亦不過十塊錢左右。治愈貧血所需之全量不過幾百塊錢（月前價格）·數千元一針的肝製劑雖然可以其名貴嚇倒窮病人，可是除了心理作用而外，沒有什麼效用。</p>
<p>（五）普通應用鐵劑的劑量常嫌太小。普通之補血丸雖然牌號很多，研其實無非是炭酸亞鐵丸之類；每丸所含鐵量甚少，其有效劑量每次需十至廿顆，每日三十至六十顆。服此丸差不多要像吃花生米一樣，始得發揮其最大療效。但是普通仿單所示，每次一二顆，實在劑量太小，奏效太慢。但是讀者千萬不可自作聰明，任意買一瓶補血丸像花生米一樣地大吃大吞，因爲普通鐵劑本身稍多吃些並無害處，可是市售補血丸中也許尙含他種成分，多服便易中毒，不可大意。總之，患者如有顯著貧血，應請可靠醫生開方吃藥才妥。</p>
<p>（七）浪費！浪費！浪費！</p>
<p>我的臨床朋友中雖然沒有滑頭醫生，可是也有少數喜歡給貧血病人打針，打肝製劑的針藥。這種現象在外國朋友中也不罕見。自然打針治療可以多收些病人的費用，可是對於病人的經濟負担增加很多，而這種增加，完全沒有意義。這是浪費！浪費！浪費！</p>
<p>肝製劑是惡性貧血的特效藥，並且拯救了不少人命，這是事實。但是惡性貧血在中國極爲少見，許多開業醫生終其身未獲一見，這也是事實。對於普通貧血，只有鐵劑才有特效，肝製劑無論口服或注射均無特效，這點早經世界權威充分證明，毫無疑義。自然，肝中含鐵相當豐富，並且也有維生素與蛋白質，當作食物吃吃，本無不可。但是爲了極微量的鐵質而花幾千元一針，實在太寃枉，太荒唐。並且多數是舶來品，這一筆經濟損失實在花得無謂之至。</p>
<p>中國，除了每年數例的例外，可說是沒有惡性貧血的國家，便應該沒有肝製劑的市塲。不論是本國貨也好，外國貨也好，市面上種種牌子肝製劑的出現，不啻給科學醫一紀重重的巴掌。朋友們，讓我們來洗去這個恥辱！（續本月二日）</p>

<h3>梅百器自傳</h3>
<p>— 建譯</p>
<p>音樂家梅百器（Paci）曾任前工部局樂隊指揮，爲遠東音樂太師，學者仰之如泰山北斗，不幸攖疾，於本月三日逝世，藝術界人士同深痛悼，茲特發表其生前自傳譯文一篇，以誌哀悼。—編者</p>
<p>我於一八七八年生於佛羅稜斯，七歲時在一個著名的拿波列學校中開始學習鋼琴。十一歲時我在拿波列一個至今已不存在的“Del　Foudo”戲院中，作第一次公開演奏。但雖有這樣一個早熟的成功，我的父親却不許我完全獻身於音樂的學習，堅持要留我在拿波列一個學院中，作一個「受輔助金的學生」。在十四歲時，有一天我賣掉了所有我的書以及僅有的一個貴重物—一隻古舊的大掛錶—而帶了一些里拉，自拿彼列的學院中逃至羅馬。因爲，我知道我所心念的鋼琴家Sgambati（李斯特最後的一個學生）在那裏，我望能看到他或者成爲一個他的學生。但要接近或謁見Sgambati委實比我所想像的要困難的多哩！我到羅馬二天以後，我帶了所有的樂譜到位於Via　della　Croce他莊嚴的住宅中去，嘗試和一個很嚴厲的「侍者」說明我的情形。但是，遭到了婉言的拒絕。最後，「侍者」這樣說：「敎授對於任何沒有介紹信的人是不接見的。」</p>
<p>當時我在羅馬城中是一個孤苦伶仃的孩子。當我只有最後二個里拉時，我的勇氣全消失了，我就發了一個電報給父親承認我的逃逸，而請他願諒且帮助我。二天後，我母親在車站旁找到了抱了很大希望在等候她的我。一間爲我們二人住的有裝飾的房間是找到了—一架陳舊而不大的大鋼琴，一封給Sgambati的介紹信全預備好了。於是，一種每天練六七小時的「Sgambati的學生」底快樂生活，便從此開始了。</p>
<p>不久，Sgambati立刻知道我家因父親的職位在米蘭，而我與母親在羅馬所需的浩大的開支。幾個月後，他對我工作的滿意以及對我將來的鋼琴生涯發生興趣，乃拒絕接受我任何爲了功課所需的費用。三年如一天般的過去，我可以不用再到他那精緻的琴室去享受他極能感動的敎授了。</p>
<p>一八九五年，我十七歲時，參加在羅馬舉行的李斯特的獎金的國際競賽，結果，我就是六十三個不同國籍，不同學校的靑年中的得勝者。</p>
<p>從此，我開始我鋼琴家的生涯。在整整一個季節中，我在意大利，法國，奧國等地舉行音樂會。僅僅在那裏我才第一次聽到使我驚奇的交響音樂會以及偉大的指揮。鋼琴即刻被我看爲一種在音樂表情很可憐的財產。明年，我到米蘭，希望在當地的著名音樂院中，做一個作曲法及管絃樂法的學生。</p>
<p>當年，「作曲法的課程」只有四個空位，而且據說，道個考試是非常困難及嚴格的。那時，我當然是一個很好的鋼琴家，同時三年來偉大的Sgambati的敎導及友誼足以使我成爲一個好音樂家。但是，我是缺少音樂理論學者的準備——我很怕去冒險。</p>
<p>幸運幫助了我。在Viscount　of　Modrone,　the　Meceuateof　the　Theatre　“La　Scala”常聚合本地名人的一個米蘭著名的名流會有音樂節目的晚上，有人請我演奏，當我彈了貝多芬的「熱情奏嗚曲」後，你猜，有誰來向我恭維一番，普西尼！（意大利近代名歌劇作家）。我發顫且快樂地告訴他，我想投考音樂院作曲班的希望，以及我最發愁的準備工作。「不要怕」他說：「我認得所有的監考人，我可給你一張寫幾句好話的名片。」如今，我勇氣百倍。在指定的那天，我帶了我的請求書到「考試委員會」去。同時又將一隻緊封了普西尼的介紹書的信對遞給了主席。至於這信封裏說的什麽，我一些也不得而知。主席看了這信，含笑的將它傳至別的監考人，然後對我說：「我想我們能接受普西尼的忠告，但你可願將「熱情奏鳴曲」彈給我們聽？你們能够想像到我對於這一點表示如何的警奇！我啞口無言的站在那裏希望得到一點說明。於是，主席再喚我說：「或者你不知道究竟普西尼爲你寫了些什麼話？請讀這卡片。」</p>
<p>普西尼這樣寫的：</p>
<p>「年輕的Paci來參加這次考試，事前並沒有準備。但不要再化時間考他的「禁止五度」；而呌他彈奏貝多芬的熱情奏鳴曲」。我很知這你不願失去一個將來很有前程的學生的。」</p>
<p>我如釋重負。如今想自從我委身於鋼琴家生活的許多年來，我從後有再在一些音樂批評大家前演奏過「熱情奏鳴曲」（我的意思說是像那樣好）。</p>
<p>自從我在音樂院中求學四年以後，應該再感謝普西尼的庇護，我在米蘭三個主要的劇院——“Lirico”，“Dal　Verne”和“La　Scala”——中担任副指揮。所以，因此我能在許多偉大的指揮Ferrari，Mugone，Mascherovie以及其中最偉大的Toscauini手下，得到關於指揮上的指導。</p>
<p>無論如何，在米蘭學習及定居四年，在我好動的本性及氣質上看來，實覺太長。况且，在那幾年中，我的音樂生活僅僅集中在歌劇方面，音樂會與交響樂是少得可憐，這使我的本性發生一種「純音樂」的飢渴。——像法國人所說：「人往往易憶起最初的愛情」。</p>
<p>長久與鋼琴的疏遠，如今變得這樣强烈的愛好。在一九〇二年的一天，我突然決定再開始我鋼琴家的旅行及流浪生活到全世界。遨遊是無限制的過去，直至一九一八年的十二月，著名的遠東音樂會管事斯多克招引我到中國和日本去作一次擴大的旅行。這樣我就到了上海。</p>
<p>我在十二月廿八日到達上海，但很不幸的染了劇病。當我從船上被抬到醫院後，我有計劃之旅行便從此取消了。在一九一九年二月，當我能再演奏時，我在夏令配克戲院開了第一次獨奏音樂會，而得到一個很大的成功。</p>
<p>但我的流浪生活就此中止。在被迫留在上海的一些游蕩的時間中，我有一個僱用所有飯店及跳舞塲中，有能力的琴師，來組織一個管絃樂隊伴奏我鋼琴協奏曲底思想產生。在四月中，在我自己指揮之下，我奏了莫差的「加冕協奏曲」。</p>
<p>在音樂會的後一天，報章方面很自然的發起了一種片新組織工部局樂隊的運動。這時代看起來是很盛旺的，上海是快樂且充滿了生命的氣息。或許我對於十六年來鋼琴家的流浪生活有一些兒厭倦，而夢想有一個管弦樂隊的將來，所以我接受了工部局當局的委任，而組織這樂隊。</p>
<p>凡是能够知道一九一九年上海情形的人，一定很容易想像到在大戰的四年後，上海市民聽到一個這種樣子的管弦樂隊和以前那僅包含十四個差不多全是菲列賓樂師的工部局銅樂隊所引起的反應了。（譯自工部局樂隊告別音樂會節目單，一九四二年）</p>
<h3>在教堂裏</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>近年來國內各大學，不論那一間，都有「團契」的組織，我們這裏也不例外，在學校的旁邊，就有一個小小的教堂，美麗別緻像一個小孩子。每禮拜天的黄昏，從小敎堂裏傳出悠然溫和而帶着慈恕感的歌聲，常常是無意間，我被這一樓歌聲引到了那裏去。在那裏，我認識了一個女孩子，她是一個虔誠的基督敎徒。有一個禮拜天的晚上，在教堂裏做禮拜的人都散了，只有她留着，約我留下來和她談談，沒有多久，她似乎有意地把話題牽到「宗敎與作家」的上面。</p>
<p>她輕輕地似牧師領導祈禱時傳神般的樣子說着：</p>
<p>「宗敎與文學是有共同的主題，和同一的目的，它們都是發掘着真善美，由於在這眞善與美的內涵與發揮，造成了他們的主題；用具體的形式，和容忍的方法，使人類達到至高的境界爲目的。所以一個牧師同時也是一個文學作家。做牧師的，他應具備內在條件的涵養，可以說已達到一個作家的要求，他只要在寫作技巧上，多加磨鍊便可以了。但一個作家，他需要更多的宗敎涵養，並且得隨時隨地注意着。只有這樣，才能使他的筆，放在人類的愛和羣衆的生靈上面。」</p>
<p>她把話暫時停了下來，望着我，微笑地似乎等待着我的意見</p>
<p>「我同意你的說法，不過宗敎的上面，有着一個神作爲主宰，牧師的職責只是替耶穌傳達意旨而已。但是一個作家，沒有什麼作他的主宰，若要說是有的話，那麼只是廣大的人民和現實的世界了。一個是爲上帝服務，一個是爲人民服務，這不是很大的差異嗎？」我慢慢地說。</p>
<p>電燈照着我們，敎堂裏是恬靜的，空下來的一列列的椅子，肅穆地伸出靠背的橫欄；在燈光下，這些漆着咖啡色的椅子，放出紫綠的光綫，好似它們正在聚精會神地聽着宗敎的宣導。</p>
<p>「這問題，我覺得應該是這樣的解釋；就是要指出耶穌需要的標準，和人民需要的標準是什麽？無疑的這兩者都是要求溫雅，順良，柔和，與博大的愛，他們旣是同出一轍，所以說耶穌與人民之間，並不是分離的兩體；牧師與作家，也沒有什麽玄妙色彩的分歧。」</p>
<p>她因爲知道我不是一個信徒，所以她不厭求詳地繼續說下去</p>
<p>「耶穌是用那種溫雅，柔和與慈愛，去把握住人類的理想，使他成爲人類熱心崇拜的對象，這是無可懷疑的。但是有些人之所以敬愛耶穌，他們並不是因爲他具體備有這些精神，而是原始地當他爲偶象去膜拜，這就是不知不覺的絕大錯誤；同時也常因此，成了別人作爲攻擊宗敎的出發點了。可是似這樣的情形，攻擊的人，自然不是無的放矢，但他們所非議的應該是那些沒有認淸信仰意義的人，而不是宗敎的本身。」</p>
<p>她像覺察了自己過度興奮，稍緩和了聲音說。</p>
<p>「耶穌是發見靈魂，確認靈魂存在的第一人，因爲他把握着一種超脫的難捉摸的情感，魯迅先生是發現中華民國民族靈魂的一人，阿Q正是揭發了民族靈魂衰頹的一面。倘若一個作家，他沒有刻劃靈魂的智慧和勇敢他是不能深入的」。</p>
<p>因爲我沒有反對她的意見，所以我還是照樣保持着沉默。</p>
<p>她請管理敎堂的工人，拿了兩杯茶給我們，她接過了茶，慢慢地放了一杯在我前面椅子背後的橫架上，她自己捧着一杯，移到她的唇邊輕啜着，我拿起了她給我的一杯茶，覺得溫熱，也覺得淸香，像有一泓溫和的情感流入我的心坎。</p>
<p>我揭開茶杯的蓋子，熱汽濛了我的眼鏡；過了一陣，蒸汽消失了，我才望見她輕巧的嘴，接上剛才的話說下去。</p>
<p>「從前一個女牧師告訴我說：寛恕比刑罰更高尙，慈愛比專制更能安撫人民的心神；像花香或小孩的純潔，那樣可愛地去把握人類的心靈，這就是溫柔順良的宗敎的思想與行爲。我們不單要求一個作家要如此，更要求藉他的筆，去訴告人們，朝這條去走。……</p>
<p>「托爾斯泰曾經是一個最反對宗敎的人，但是到了他晚年的時候，他走回到宗敎的路上了。果然，我們對宗敎的態度，還是有認識不健全的地方，我常記着托爾斯泰的話，現在最好重說他的話，並且也應採取他那樣的態度」。</p>
<p>他喝了一口茶，我玩着茶杯的蓋子，聽她說。</p>
<p>「托爾斯泰說，眞正的宗敎是人與週圍的無限生命間的，合乎理性又合乎智慧底一種關係，是這樣地使他的生命與無限連繫在一起，並且指點了他的行爲的。你相信他的話嗎？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，發出滿意的笑，她也高興地笑了。</p>
<p>夜漸漸深了，我們不約而同站起來，我抬頭望着室内講壇後面，掛在牆上的大十字架，週圍閃閃地像顯出了一團光圈似的。</p>
<p>我再轉過臉望着她，在她的臉上，還是慣常的微微笑着，我向她說了再見，先離開敎堂了。</p>
<p>沿着籬笆，我慢慢地踱返宿舍，路旁雪白的金盞花，在夜裏更顯得那末白灼灼地，一陣陣帶着芳香的春夜裏的和風迎着我，我回頭看看這座小小的敎堂，這女孩子的話，還在我的耳邊，雖然，她不是有意的對我佈道，或者要求我作一個信徒，我也無心爲此；但我是希望並且相信：人應該向至善的路走。——這意念可以彌補我的空虛，或者也可以慰安這位女孩子對我的和愛。</p>

<h3>造船（世界名畫選載）</h3>
<p>— 約翰·康斯特波作（一七七六—一八三七）</p>
<p>陳列於倫敦維多利亞博物院</p>
<p>康斯特波（John　Constable）生時就享譽法國，但在他的本土英國，直到他去世以後，人們才充份地欣赏到他的天才。他的父親，是一個有錢的磨粉廠的廠主。老康斯特波的意思，原是呌他繼承父業的，所以，他在十八歲時，就參加磨粉廠的工作。但是，他的天才，必須得到一個出路，結果，他的父母終於送他到倫敦去研究藝術。兩年之後，他又回到了老家，代替磨粉塲中的一個老職員工作；大約做了一年多以後，他進了皇家學院。</p>
<p>最初，他也是依照傳統的方式學習：畫像和臨慕名家的作品。他在學院中初次展覽的風景畫，得到該校校長極大的鼓勵和讚譽。他一向確信，可以走自然畫家的路——寶綠色的草，潺潺的溪流。</p>
<p>「造船」是康氏一八一五年所繪，是他構製偉大作品，獲得隆譽過程中的，一個重要階梯。</p>
<p>康斯特波是一個愛好自然，愛好鄉村的偉大畫家。</p>

<h3>人言可愛</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>爲了選舉上海小姐事，蘇北難民教濟會昨天特地招待新聞界及各組候選人，據說越劇組的袁雪芬小姐曾當塲表示不擬參加，原因爲了「人言可畏」云云。猜想起來，當時塲中空氣一定相當緊張，這，我們從吳開先先生的接下去的發言就可明瞭了。吳先生說，人言可畏應該改爲人言可愛。</p>
<p>我們無從知道袁小姐的話何所指，不過仔細想來一定嚴重，記得當初電影明星阮玲玉臨死前，也曾說過「人言可畏」這句話。老實說，一個有正義有人格而凜於他的責任之神聖和重大的新聞工作者，他發誓一定愼重，發言也一定負責的。至於捕風捉影，造謠生事，那不能當作立誓的誓看的。因此，根據客觀事實的報道或論評，它是有它的力量的，說它可畏亦無不可。</p>
<p>今日社會，任何一件事總難免沒有閒言閒語，人們心理陷入無信仰階段，而對一切現象又愛從壞處着想，愛看反面文章，愛聽鬼話，愛知道秘密或陰私，如果沒有勇氣面對這股大逆流，捨隨波浮沉外，又有什麽路可走。以上海小姐選舉事爲例，誰勇敢，誰懦怯，誰在旁邊說風凉話，一淸二楚。在這里，使人感覺到袁雪芬小姐畢竟還天眞，有許多自命爲婦女界先鋒，自命爲熱心社會公益的人士，請問她們在什麼地方，爲何不出來？</p>
<p>子路聞過則喜，吳開先先生的「人言可愛」確具哲理，流行的說法，當爲接受批判，實行自我撿討了。一個人倘眞能覺得人言可愛，這人最低限度是謙虛有涵養，能尊重別人的意見。自然，可愛是一回事，它不過表示個人對於對方的一種態度，或者一種心理上的反映狀態，而接受採納與否那又是一回事，因爲這便要牽涉到對於人言的判斷估價等等的問題了。</p>
<p>在做人的道理上，我們應該奉行「人言可愛」，不管對方動機目的如何，也不管是毁是譽，他總是在關切自己，對於關切自己的人，豈不應以好禮貌待之乎？</p>
<h3>薦頭店黑幕　有錢難找好傭人</h3>
<p>— 義</p>
<p>讀本刋「傭婦難服侍」一文，余甚表同情，惟余之意傭婦尙不難服侍，召雇傭婦之薦頭店老關爲是難服侍，若無十二分耐心，恐一輩子休想用到好的傭婦，下面就是余家雇用傭婦的一個經騐。</p>
<p>上月間，余家向某街某薦頭店召雇傭婦一人，蔫頭店老關伴來一個傭婦，浦東籍，年紀約摸三十多歲，余內人略爲盤問數語，認爲人品尙覺不錯，留下試用，薦頭店老關索去車資五千元，臨走時約明試用三天，如雙方合意，再來講工錢。一宿無話，到了翌日午飯過後，那傭婦忽向內人開口，「我要去了，這裏做不慣，」内人問她什麼事情做不慣？她只是笑而不答，大有「合則留不合即去」之慨，內人無奈，只得送她二千元工錢，讓她去了。余因家中急欲傭婦，復至該薦頭店說明原由，未隔二小時，薦頭店老關又伴來一個傭婦，年紀也在四十左右，强本地音，夾着些江北調，照樣留下試用，給付薦頭店老關車資五千元而去，到了晚上，這傭婦和内人問長問短，絮煩不休，什麽白米幾斗一喊？淘米之時何人量米？米間是否加銷？上街買菜每日用錢多少？親戚有無常常往來？太太出去看電影房門鎖否？種種不倫不類之言，内人聽得心驚肉跳，一到明日午飯過後，那傭婦回言「太太，我要去了，這裏做不慣，」內人連忙點頭答應，你做得慣也不要你，給了兩千塊錢趕快去罷，余換了一所薦頭店去召雇，同樣一連三日，換了三個，總是「一宿三餐，二千工錢、外加五千車資，」好像都是一個訓練所裏畢業的，後來有一傭婦，居然做了一天，不說去了，三日之後，薦頭店老關來家問訊，此婦是否合意？內人耐着性子和他講工錢，結果每月工錢法幣六萬，薦頭店酬勞，由雇主與傭婦各出半個月，內人先付他三萬，傭婦方面因爲沒有錢，先借工錢一個月，同時由傭婦付與薦頭店老關三萬元，這樣算雇到了一個傭婦，那知做到了第十五天，足整半個月，那傭婦忽然變故來了，向内人說道，「家裏老娘有病，急欲回去料理家事，這裏不幹了，」說着拿了衣包，不管主人允許，匆匆出門去了，最奇怪的，隔了一天，那個薦頭店老關還來探望她呢，現在余家裏沒有傭人，一切家務，由内人自己動手，少生氣惱，發誓不再到薦頭店裏去雇用傭婦了。</p>

<p>現在的時候仍是闊的越闊，窮的越窮，眞是有錢可使鬼推磨，余此次天津一行一途眞是見識不少，我坐的船上大多數爲北上的官兵，其他乘客則極少，求人，託人，總算弄了一張票，廿多萬還只是通艙，甲板上簡直連立足的地方也沒有，要是買一睡位則非六七萬不可，同船上有兩××化了十萬元買二帆布床睡，還是××特別便宜，船到了天津，兩位××拿了帆布床往岸上走，茶房可急壞了。</p>
<p>「先生，床不能拿去」！</p>
<p>「甚麼？我化了十萬元買兩帆布床，我還覺得吃虧呢！爲甚麼不許帶走」。</p>
<p>於是吵了起來，××終是×人，茶房也沒辦法，况且在船上××就是老爺，於是退一步只有講價錢，結果總算茶房退了六萬元給××了事。</p>
<p>此眞可謂硬碰硬，黑吃黑。</p>

<h3>父親（下）</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>我拿錢的手猛的劇烈地顫抖了，淚珠汨汨地堕下來，眼前祇覺得一片糢糊，隱約間我瞧見母親立在面前，我不知道應該如何謝她，我眞說不出的感激她。想不到她竟爲了我們忍痛割愛。唉！區區寸草心怎樣才能够報得三春輝呀！</p>
<p>「樑，好上學去了，」母親的聲音，在那時我覺得更悅耳，即使集合世界上最美妙的音樂也萬萬及不上。</p>
<p>「噢！媽，我去了！」我覺得一陣心酸，在路上，我不斷地用手帕拭着眼睛。</p>
<p>去年的冬天，父親雖然在那時已經有了職業，可是物價高漲，所入僅敷所出，那裏有額餘的錢付學費。</p>
<p>又因爲是年底，各方債務催逼，父親籌劃所得，往往爲了要抑住債主們的冷嘲熱罵，無形中缺少了笑臉。最後，甚至於完全失蹤。</p>
<p>學費呢？又得重新設法了，父親日夜在外間忙碌地奔走着。費了許多口舌在與他的朋友們商量，雖然他絲毫不和我談起，可是我暗中亦知道他爲了我們的學費在勞苦着！</p>
<p>在他的垂頭喪氣的態度，和心灰意懶的神情中，我窺探到他奔走的結果。</p>
<p>父親常爲了我們的學費憂急。我們就學的有六人，二弟頗懂人情世故，所以不常在父親前提起學費，三妹四妹和三弟四弟常常繼住父親吵着：「爸，校中的先生說，假使學費不早些付，會付不進的。」「爸，學費怎麽還不去付，將來或許會不收的。」</p>
<p>母親雖然常常喝止他們，可是倔强的弟妹們常常不聽，有時也使父親發怒了。</p>
<p>一大，我對父親說：「爸，讓我去做生意吧，學費又增加了，……」</p>
<p>「一共還有半年，就可以畢業了。」</p>
<p>當天晚上，父親購了四張翌日開獎的獎券，父親並不是一個命運論者，並且他是嫉惡賭博的，以前我從來沒看見他買過這一類的東西，所以這使我奇怪，不禁猜疑了許多時候。</p>
<p>夜裏睡在床上，左思右想，翻來覆去的睡不着，四圍靜悄悄的，沒有一絲聲息，除了鐘聲在滴搭滴搭地吟咏着詩歌。突然，我聽見父親的囈語</p>
<p>父親說：「樑，獎劵着了嗎？……」</p>
<p>一片靜寂。</p>
<p>「着的是頭獎，還是二獎？拿去付學費吧，替弟弟妹妹也……」</p>
<p>父親翻了一個身，含糊的聲音便沒有了。我再伸長耳朶聽，但是沒聽見什麼。</p>
<p>我再也忍不住了，我抱着枕頭大哭了，父親對我們的天倫之愛，使我感動極了！我再有甚麼話可說呢！</p>
<p>隔了一天，獎券號碼揭曉了，一張也沒有中。可是父親郤輕描淡寫的說：「這種東西本來是屬騙人的，當然不會中的。」</p>
<p>開學時，父親依舊給我學費，命我去付，我沒敢問他，錢的來源。</p>
<p>一個星期日，當父親出去後，母親秘密地對我說：「你父親一直關照我，不要和你講這件事，我想，與你講也沒有關係的，這一次的學費是你父親當掉了兩件皮袍子，才替你付的，你應該用功一點！」</p>
<p>不等母親辭畢，我急忙追出去。</p>
<p>在料峭的厲風中，我瞧見父親的瑟縮着的，戰抖着的背影，在寒冷中，掙扎地，奮鬥地抵抗着那銳利如割的西北風。那時，路上什麼也沒有。</p>

<h3>Marshal Ma Returns to Nanjing to Strengthen Negotiations; Expected to Meet with Representatives from Both the Nationalist and Communist Parties Soon; Peace Can Be Achieved by Implementing the Old Plan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Guling, 8th] Marshal Marshall, accompanied by his wife, went to the Chairman's residence at 12:30 PM today to bid farewell to Chairman Chiang. The Chairman and his wife invited Marshal Marshall and his wife to lunch and talked for an hour and a half. After returning to his residence, Marshal Marshall left Guling by sedan at 3:20 PM in the afternoon, after a passing shower, amidst the clear and beautiful lake scenery, and flew to Nanjing by plane from Xunyang. It is said that Marshal Marshall jokingly said to his wife before leaving, "I will come back next week." It is reported that Marshal Marshall will return to Nanjing this time to continue negotiations with the Communist Party on the issue of troop reorganization and ceasefire with his utmost efforts. General political issues are currently being handled by Ambassador Stuart, who is studying and negotiating with all parties. Rumors that Ambassador Stuart returned to Nanjing this time to negotiate the reorganization of the government are absolutely untrue. Because before the completion of troop reorganization and demobilization, there will be no discussion of reorganizing the government or expanding the foundation of the government for the time being. The National Government must build the future new government on the basis of peaceful unification with complete order in order to implement its great plan of saving and building the country. According to reliable sources, Marshal Marshall visited Mount Lu three times last Saturday and met with Chairman Chiang. He has a further understanding of the Chairman's consistent advocacy of resolving domestic disputes through political means. He also sympathizes with the Chinese government's desire to insist on implementing the troop reorganization plan and quickly restore transportation in order to stabilize social order and complete the demobilization plan. Marshal Marshall will return to Nanjing this time to continue to work for peace in China based on his past valuable experience. However, what Marshal Marshall brought to Nanjing this time, besides some new information added to his luggage, such as the report of the Anping Incident, etc., are only some old plans that may be submitted for review. There are no new plans. Because to resolve the current disputes in China, peace can be achieved only by sincerely implementing the old plans that the Communist Party once agreed to sign. Otherwise, no one can predict what stage the future situation in China will evolve into.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing at 7:30 PM tonight amidst heavy rain. Marshal Marshall, at the age of 65, traveled between Nanjing and Guling tirelessly. He must be very tired. Therefore, after getting off the plane, Marshal Marshall went directly to his residence to rest. It is said that Ambassador Stuart will meet with Marshal Marshall tomorrow morning to discuss issues such as the Anping Incident and peace negotiations between the Nationalist and Communist parties. Well-informed sources believe that after Marshal Marshall meets with Ambassador Stuart, he will invite representatives from the government and the Communist Party to hold negotiations.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Guling, 8th] Marshal Marshall's descent from the mountain after Ambassador Stuart clearly aims to accelerate the progress of the initial contacts made by the Ambassador in Nanjing for continued peace negotiations, and to negotiate the Anping Incident with the Communist Party. Observers believe that, based on Chief of Staff Chen's remarks at the press conference in Guling yesterday, continued peace negotiations should still be within the scope of the four key topics that Chairman Chiang urgently requested to be effectively resolved in the 23-day ceasefire order issued in June this year. These four topics are ceasefire, troop reorganization, restoration of transportation, and discussion of Communist army areas. If the Communist Party can show concrete facts on these four topics, other problems can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart Receives Zeng Qi</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Ambassador Stuart did not go out all day today. In addition to receiving the visiting Dutch Minister to China, Long Yun, the President of the Military Advisory Council, Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited him one after another. Long's visit was an ordinary one, discussing general issues in a broad way; Zeng gave a detailed explanation of the Youth Party's policies and platform, put forward proposals on national affairs, and sought advice from Ambassador Stuart. In the evening, Stuart also invited former US Embassy Counselor Smyth and his wife to dinner. The US Embassy area was without power tonight. The ambassador talked with Smith by candlelight, which involved the China issue and the Anping Incident. When the reporter visited, the ambassador was about to go to bed. After talking with the reporter for a short while, he personally held a candle to send him to the door. It is reported that the Ambassador is still waiting for public opinion in the United States. Recently, a New York newspaper commented on the Anping Incident, believing that the Communist Party's attempt to use the Anping Incident as a means to achieve the goal of the US military's withdrawal is a complete mistake. This view is quite common in the United States and is enough to illustrate the general attitude of the US public opinion. The Ambassador is seeking a fair approach to ensure that peace negotiations are not interrupted, and at the same time, to prevent the Anping Incident from affecting peace negotiations. Some people say that the Communist Party cannot shirk its responsibility for the Anping Incident, but so far, the Communist Party has not expressed any admission of its mistakes. Therefore, some people believe that after Marshal Marshall returns to Nanjing, he will ask Zhou for a definite answer on this matter.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Anping Incident Begins; Special Group of the Executive Headquarters Set Off Once; Conflicts Between Nationalist and Communist Armies in the Area to be Mediated Separately</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] American member of the Executive Headquarters, Robertson, proposed that each of the three parties send two reporters to accompany the 25th group to investigate the Anping Incident. The government has designated Zhao Xiaozhang, a reporter from the Central News Agency, and Zhang Jianmei, a reporter from this newspaper, to participate.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] After five rounds of consultations, the special group of the Executive Headquarters for investigating the Anping Incident, following the US proposal, set off at 2:30 PM on the 8th to conduct a preliminary investigation on the spot. They returned to Beiping that night and set off again on the morning of the 9th. The three members of the Executive Headquarters gave special instructions to the group representatives last night, hoping that the three representatives would conduct the investigation with a spirit of cooperation, democratic methods, and a fair attitude. At the same time, in order to make the outside world understand the truth of the investigation, each of the three parties sent two reporters to accompany them. Because the Communist reporters had to be picked up from Zhangjiakou, the reporters could not go with them on the afternoon of the 8th and will go together on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Beiping, 8th] The special group of the Executive Headquarters, responsible for investigating the case of the American soldiers being attacked, drove to the scene of the incident in five cars with white flags at 2:00 PM on the 8th to conduct an on-site investigation. The start of this investigation coincided with the tenth day after the incident occurred.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The Nationalist and Communist armies are still fighting fiercely in areas such as Hexiwu, Matouzhen, and Anping on the Pingjin Highway. The Executive Headquarters decided to send a subgroup under the special group investigating the Xiaoshahe Incident to mediate the conflict. It is expected to depart on the 12th. The Communist army has added approximately 4,000 reinforcements in the area.</p>
<h3>Sichuan and Jiangxi Grain Reserves Are Very Abundant</h3>

<h3>Chairman's Aluminum Statue</h3>

<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, New York, 7th, United Press] Reynolds Metals Company hosted a banquet for General He Yingqin, General Shang Zhen, and Mr. Zhang Pingqun, etc. During the banquet, they requested to send representatives to China to request the cooperation of the Chinese government in order to establish a large-scale aluminum manufacturing industry in China. They said: Your country has bauxite and labor, but lacks industry, while we have technology and capital to help you complete what you need. Shang Zhen, on behalf of Chairman Chiang, accepted the aluminum statue of Chairman Chiang presented by the company. General Shang allowed it to be sent to Nanjing immediately as a symbol of American friendship with China.</p>

According to a spokesperson, the Communist army is attacking Datong while simultaneously launching a full-scale offensive against the Zhengtai Railway, apparently intending to sever the connection between Shanxi and other provinces in preparation for an attack on Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] Telephone from Baoding: The Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railway line is again under great pressure. Yangquan and Pingding were attacked by the Communist army yesterday afternoon. The National Army has established a tight defense line along the railway. The Communist army near Zhengding, Hebei, has moved southwest and is concentrated in Jingxing and Niangzi Pass, awaiting orders.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 8th] National Army reinforcements on the Zhengtai Railway, and fierce battles are unfolding west of Niangzi Pass. Traffic west of Shijiazhuang is currently unable to reach Zhengshui, east of Jingxing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] The Communist army north of Taiyuan, Shanxi, launched an attack on Xinxian but was repelled by the National Army on the same day. The Communist army fled to the plains north of Xinkouzhen. During this battle, the Communist army used a large number of poison gas shells, and many National Army soldiers were poisoned. The National Army also seized poison gas shells among the spoils of war.</p>
<p>Following the ambush of the US Marine Corps by the Communists near Anping, tanks are now used to escort supplies. The photograph shows two tanks closely following the first Marine Corps truck, passing a National Army outpost (United Press photo).</p>

<h3>UNRRA is Expected to End Operations by Next Spring; LaGuardia to Visit China; Special Far East Meeting to be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] UNRRA sources state: Director LaGuardia will inspect Warsaw (capital of Poland) and Prague (capital of Czechoslovakia) and is expected to arrive in China around October 9th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 7th] LaGuardia made this announcement in response to the latest quarterly report to the Fourth Council of UNRRA. He stated that UNRRA's European relief program will end on October 31st, and the Eastern part will end on March 31st of next year. However, the shipment of relief supplies will continue beyond those dates. He will travel to China to see the situation firsthand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] UNRRA announced that as of last week, 801,138 tons of relief supplies have been shipped to China. Recently, 32 ships carrying 130,250 tons of supplies arrived in Shanghai, and another six ships carrying 11,355 tons of war materials arrived in Hong Kong. In addition, 18 transport ships carrying 40,815 tons of supplies have arrived at Shanghai docks. A total of 44 ships carrying 134,500 tons of supplies are en route to China and are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. Furthermore, three UNRRA doctors and one sanitary engineer, bringing 1,100 pounds of relief medicine, flew to Weiyang by special plane yesterday to provide relief to victims in Hunan Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 7th, United Press] US Undersecretary of State Clayton told the Fifth Administrative Conference of UNRRA that the United States will no longer contribute funds to UNRRA. Countries must now find ways to restore world trade and no longer rely on relief.</p>
<p>[This city] A special meeting of the UNRRA Far East Region representatives is scheduled to be held tomorrow morning (10th) at 10:00 AM at the Bank of Shanghai building. Director Chiang Ting-fu will chair the meeting. Representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, India, Austria, the Netherlands, and New Zealand will attend. The main topic will be a review of UNRRA's work in the Far East Region.</p>
<h3>Expedite Restoration of Material Shipments to China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 7th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia, when reporting to the Fifth Plenary Session of UNRRA, expressed regret that UNRRA had failed to ship sufficient food to China. He stated that China urgently needs relief, but the lack of transportation within the country makes it very difficult to distribute $53.5 million worth of supplies to various locations. He and Deputy Director Jacques are working hard to improve the UNRRA mission in China. Fortunately, US Army Major General Edgerton has been appointed director of the China Division. However, the traffic situation in China in June was very bad, causing supplies to pile up in ports and suffer localized damage. As a result, the shipment of all materials except food was suspended to China. This does not mean a complete stop or reduction in aid to China. As of June 22nd, 42 cargo ships were waiting to unload in Chinese ports. It is expected that the situation will improve by September, and freight transport will be restored as much as possible at that time. He met with the head of the Chinese delegation yesterday and was very satisfied. He is confident that the Chinese government fully understands and is fully cooperating. UNRRA is only a temporary organization, and the budget for 1947 has not yet been prepared. After UNRRA ceases operations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will be responsible for distributing food. It is hoped that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will provide low-interest loans to war-torn countries to engage in industrial reconstruction.</p>
<h3>"Time" is "Supplies"; The CNRRA hopes to extend the working period; Improving the distribution of supplies is under discussion.</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] After UNRRA Director LaGuardia advocated that the agency's termination date should not be postponed, this reporter specifically interviewed CNRRA Director Chiang, asking what impact this move might have on CNRRA. Chiang replied: CNRRA's task was originally to handle UNRRA's relief supplies to China and transport these supplies to areas in need. After UNRRA terminates its operations, CNRRA will also terminate its operations. However, due to the need to transport this final batch of supplies, CNRRA's termination may be delayed slightly, but it will not exceed three months at most, and these supplies will definitely be transported. The termination date for UNRRA was originally set for the end of this year, and CNRRA was originally scheduled to end on March 31st of next year. However, China has a vast territory, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. In some inland areas, roads must be built while transporting supplies, and the handling capacity of seaports is also very limited. Even in China's largest seaport, the harbor has not been dredged for nine years, so the handling capacity has been reduced by 40% compared to before. We cannot perform "magic" to enlarge this seaport, so we can only hope that the time can be extended sufficiently. At the previous UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, a proposal was passed to the UNRRA General Assembly to extend the total working time to June 30th of next year. Whether or not a further extension will be necessary at that time can be considered. At that time, China's request was to extend the working period of CNRRA to September 30th of next year. China's request remains the same in this UNRRA General Assembly, because I deeply know that in terms of China's post-war relief, "time" is "supplies." In addition, the CNRRA Northeast Branch organized five inspection teams to study epidemic prevention methods in various plague-prone areas in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yitong Discusses the Domestic Situation; Has Three Misunderstandings About Politics; The World Will Not See War Again in the Next Twenty Years</h3>
<p>[This City] China's new ambassador to Iran, Zheng Yitong, is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Calcutta on the 17th and then travel to Tehran to take up his new post. Zheng was the former minister to Australia. After returning to the country this spring to report on his work, he was transferred to his new position. Yesterday, he received reporters at his private residence and first made a statement on promoting friendly relations between China and Iran. He said: "China and Iran are two of the world's great ancient countries. As early as 2,000 years ago, cultural relations occurred between the two countries, and friendly relations have always been close. Recently, the new Iranian government has laid the foundation for peaceful construction, and China is now also seeking a new construction foundation on the road to peaceful unification. The mutual assistance and cooperation between the new Iran and the new China in the future in terms of culture and economy will depend on our efforts. I believe that the development of friendly relations between China and Iran must become increasingly friendly."</p>
<p>Regarding the recent developments in the Eastern situation, Zheng believes that order will be restored soon, and further progress can be made to promote the realization of world peace. Zheng said: "After the surrender of Germany and Japan, all countries felt the great suffering of war and were eager to recover and rebuild. They had no intention and dared not test the flames of a third world war. Therefore, in the next twenty years, we dare to assert that the countries of the world will certainly not see war again."</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked him about his impressions after returning to the country from Australia. He said: "The current instability in the country is an inevitable trend after the end of the eight-year War of Resistance. Lao Tzu said: 'After a great war, there will inevitably be a year of famine.' If we understand this point, we can be calm. "Regarding the issue of negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists, Zheng believes that the key lies in whether the Chinese Communist Party is sincere. At the same time, he hopes that American and Soviet politicians will have a clear understanding of all their propaganda and not be deceived by it. Zheng also said: "I have three misunderstandings about the current domestic political situation: (1) Up to now, the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists is still about territory. In such a state of national recovery, no party or faction in the country has proposed proposals to improve the current living conditions of the people; (2) Non-partisans can also become a group and form a force in our country; (3) The basic proposition of the Communist Party is to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, but it considers itself a democratic party. In terms of freedom of opinion, if the Yan'an newspaper can freely criticize everything that the CCP leader Mao Zedong says and does, we cannot believe it." Zheng finally said: "In today's world, any country must respond to international trends externally and follow the domestic environment internally to establish an unyielding, self-reliant foundation. Our country is one part of the world, and we cannot be an exception."</p>

<h3>Direct Trains to Run Between Beiping and Shenyang; Twice a Week Starting from the 19th of This Month; Northeast Grain Will Be Transported Inward in a Steady Stream</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 8th] The connection between inside and outside the Pass has become a reality. Transportation authorities in the Northeast and Tianjin-Beiping held a meeting in Shenyang on the 5th and decided to open direct trains between Beiping and Shenyang on the 19th of this month. Trains will depart from Beiping every Monday and Thursday and from Shenyang every Tuesday and Friday. It is planned that starting from September 18th, a daily direct train will run. The direct train will stop at Tianjin, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, Xingcheng, Jinzhou, and Dahu Mountain, but not at other stations. Round-trip trains will stay overnight in Jinzhou because it is not convenient to travel at night. Another important decision made at the meeting was to transport grain into the Pass. The grain blockade order in the Northeast has been lifted, and it has been decided to transport 2,000 tons of grain to Tianjin-Beiping daily. Cars have already been allocated to Shenyang on the 7th, and Northeast grain will soon be transported into the Pass in a steady stream. The grain transport vehicles are also direct.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondences: Communist Army in the Haizhou Area; Arrests and Kills the Parents of Fleeing Draftees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Haizhou Correspondence] Recently, the Communist army in the Yangjiaji area of Guanling County has been forcibly conscripting young men aged 18 to 40 and sending them to the battlefield after concentrated training. They are also forcibly conscripting women aged 15 to 40 and organizing them into comfort teams. Recently, Chen Jinde, 28 years old, who was originally a small vendor, ran away before being drafted. The Communist Party's county government discovered this and, in addition to arresting his father, Chen Xuedian, also burned down his three-room house. They ordered Chen Xuedian to hand over his son quickly. Upon hearing this news, Chen Jinde dared not return home even more. Seeing that his son had not been handed over for a long time, the Communist army tied Chen Xuedian to the Yangji market and executed him by shooting.</p>

<p>電籲免征麺粉貨稅 (*Telegraph Urging Exemption from Flour Commodity Tax*)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has decided to send a telegram to the relevant departments of the Legislative Yuan, which recently passed a bill on levying commodity tax on flour, requesting a review and exemption in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. In order to understand the situation of our county, this reporter made a special visit to the chairman of the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Zhang, and inquired about the matter. He told us: "I attended the joint meeting this time and discussed this matter. I feel that at this time when famine is rampant in Hebei and Shandong, flour is one of the main auxiliary food items for the people. If another burden is added, it will directly stimulate the price of food to rise and indirectly hinder the people's food. Therefore, a motion has been established to telegraph the Yuan and appeal for exemption."</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>派員催繳預借田賦 (*Dispatching Personnel to Urge Payment of Advance Farmland Tax*)</p>
<p>The county government of our county has been ordered to collect 30,000 shi of farmland tax in advance. The first deadline is the 15th of this month, and half of the amount must be paid. County Magistrate Xu has ordered the Land and Food Department to take charge of the matter and distribute the task to various districts. Director Hou has assigned department members Chen Xiaojun to Zhangjingqiao and Changanqiao districts, Sun Yaoting to Dongting, Anzhen, and Dangkou districts, Wu Shibao to Qianzhou, Luoshe, and Autonomous Experiment Village, and Shan Hongyuan to Zhouxinzhen and Outangqiao districts. They set off one after another on the 7th to supervise and urge the payment of advance tax and to investigate the flood situation.</p>
<p>Dangtu</p>
<p>縣長逃遁交接停滯 (*County Magistrate Flees, Turnover Stagnates*)</p>
<p>The newly appointed county magistrate of this county, Zhang Muye, has just taken office. Due to the fact that the outgoing county magistrate, Wan Shijun, fled without resigning while the turnover of matters was still incomplete, leaving only the handover officer Gao Ya to handle the matter, he is now under surveillance, causing the turnover work to suddenly be delayed. In order to understand the situation, this reporter visited the various departments of the county government. According to detailed inquiries, in addition to the financial department receiving 1,687,000 yuan in cash, the handover of all large quantities of materials, parts, furniture, transportation equipment such as transport ships and automobiles, and the land and food departments had not been completed. The firearms and ammunition of the military department are still being counted and handed over. Furthermore, all parties are paying close attention to the cases of traitors in this county and are waiting for the new magistrate to handle them. It is reported that the former magistrate destroyed a large number of relevant documents before fleeing, causing the new magistrate to feel unable to investigate and deal with the cases.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Adjusting Salaries and Political Reform</h3>
<p>The National Defense Supreme Council held a meeting the day before yesterday and passed a resolution to once again consolidate civil servant salaries. Starting in August, it will be implemented, with the base amount for Beijing and Shanghai increased to 110,000 yuan, and the multiplier increased to 720 times. According to this calculation, the salary of appointed officials will be around 200,000 yuan, and the salary of recommended officials will reach 300,000 yuan. At a time when the government's finances are extremely tight, the sudden and early adjustment of civil servant salaries is undoubtedly a most gratifying and noteworthy phenomenon in the current political landscape.</p>
<p>This newspaper has always been sympathetic to the meager salaries of civil servants; however, given the state of the nation's financial revenue and expenditure, we must support the government's gradual adjustment method. If we were to disregard everything and greatly increase civil servant salaries, and there were no other ways to address the financial implications, resorting only to increasing the amount of legal tender issued to make up for this increased expenditure, then inflation would worsen, and prices would rise sharply and rapidly. Not only would there be no hope of improving the lives of civil servants, but it would also trigger unrest and create financial chaos. Therefore, adjusting civil servant salaries must take into account the current state of financial revenue and expenditure. However, this time, the government has increased civil servant salaries by an average of 50%, which is a considerable sum when calculated based on the total number of civil servants nationwide. Whether this will affect national finances and prices is a matter of great concern to the people of the country. According to Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, "The state treasury is in good condition. The amount of legal tender issued has not increased in July of this year, and this adjustment will not affect national finances." At the same time, Minister Peng of the Propaganda Department also said, "Recently, in addition to the general decline in the prices of imported goods, grain prices in various provinces have generally fallen due to the autumn harvest. Therefore, raising salaries will not affect prices." From this, it can be seen that our country's finances have reached a relatively sound state, and adjusting salaries will not increase inflation, nor will it stimulate price increases. Therefore, there is indeed hope for improving the lives of civil servants in the future.</p>
<p>"When clothing and food are sufficient, one knows propriety and righteousness." After the lives of civil servants are stable, they will be able to work with peace of mind, which can not only improve administrative efficiency, but also curb the trend of corruption. Therefore, we can regard this salary adjustment as the starting point for political reform. When discussing Chinese politics today, everyone sees the incompatibility between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as the current stalemate in the situation. The Communist Party's attempt to resolve political disputes by force, seize cities and territories, and establish independent regimes is indeed the root cause of all domestic warfare. However, the government should also deeply reflect on why the Communist Party, which has been abandoned by the people for its "revolutionary methods" of arson, murder, and plunder, has not weakened but has instead grown stronger over the past decade. Strategically, there is the saying "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." In political struggles, it is even more important to "know yourself and know your enemy," otherwise you will not be able to defeat your political opponents. It cannot be denied that the people are deeply concerned about the current corruption in politics because of their personal experience, and they urgently expect the government to reform politics. The idiom "yearning for governance" (喁喁望治) is probably not enough to express even a fraction of their feelings. Because the people are dissatisfied with the status quo, they are often easily exploited by ambitious people. This is also the reason for the expansion of the Communist Party's power today, which deserves introspection by our country's authorities.</p>
<p>The common ills of politics today are nothing more than two: First, the incompetence of those in power. Whether in central or local administrative agencies, from the responsible officials to the clerks, there are very few capable talents. There is basically no administrative efficiency. When handling official business, documents simply go around in circles, and it is unknown when they can be approved. This is certainly a long-standing habit in Chinese officialdom, but today's China is very different from the past, and we must not let it go unchecked without finding ways to improve it. Second, the prevalence of corruption. What was the political atmosphere during the Anti-Japanese War? There is no need to say more. Judging from the current situation in the political arena, almost "no official is not corrupt." Examples of this emerge almost every day. For example, yesterday's newspaper reported that a tax collector in the Hankou Municipal Direct Taxation Bureau had embezzled as much as 100 million yuan. The endless stream of such corruption cases not only arouses public resentment towards the government, but also leads to a loss of national dignity. Reforming politics must start with rectifying the administration, and to change the political atmosphere, it is especially necessary to promote integrity. There is a Chinese saying: "Military men are not afraid of death, and scholars do not want money." Although it is outdated, it still has value in today's era of rampant corruption.</p>
<p>Before the civil servant salaries were adjusted, although we wanted to raise this issue for discussion, we were constrained by the general public's view that "salaries are meager, how can we talk about administrative efficiency if we cannot work with peace of mind?" or "How can poor civil servants survive if they are law-abiding and do not accept illicit wealth?" We cannot expect everyone to be sages and heroes, who can sacrifice themselves for the group. Now that salaries have been adjusted, although it cannot be said to be generous, it is a small supplement to their basic lives. At a time when the government's finances are extremely tight, it still wants to adjust civil servant salaries. If they still cannot understand the government's painstaking efforts, and fail to increase administrative efficiency and eliminate corruption, then how can they be worthy of the country! And how can they be worthy of the people!</p>
<p>In short, the current political situation is as depressing as the weather these days; however, we believe that the future is bright, and that everything depends on human effort. Moreover, force cannot solve the problem. The political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party does not need to be overly emphasized from the people's standpoint; what is most important is whether the government has a firm determination to reform politics. Whether the general civil servants can automatically reform themselves to create an excellent political atmosphere. If Chinese politics can emphasize administrative efficiency, then the political atmosphere will be clean and honest, and everything will be on the right track of the rule of law, then the enemy party will have no opportunity to exploit, and political struggles will not be able to be launched. Therefore, we believe that this salary adjustment is of great significance and hold great hope for it. We hope that this salary adjustment will be the starting point for political reform in our country.</p>

<h3>The Plenary Session of the Peace Conference Was Held Yesterday, and the Proposal for a Voting System Was Put Forward for Discussion. Molotov Demanded a Re-examination and Revision</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 8th: The Peace Conference convened a plenary session at 4:00 PM today (midnight Shanghai time). At the center of the semi-circular seating arrangement, Bernas and Molotov sat side by side, with the French delegation on the left and the British delegation on the right. Within five minutes, the representatives took their seats in order, but the seats in the hall were only two-thirds full. First, the method of voting was discussed. Bidault proposed using a show of hands to vote on the proposal, but Molotov stood up and said that the Rules Committee had not accepted the Soviet proposal yesterday, which was a major error. The Soviet Union opposed the majority vote of one-third agreed upon by the committee. For example, forcing other countries to accept with eleven votes over ten is unreasonable, and he requested that the plenary session re-examine and revise it. Australian representative Evatt strongly refuted this, and a fierce debate is still in progress.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] Observers predict that after the Peace Conference enters the stage of concrete discussion, the issue of Trieste will be the most difficult. The plenary session of the Peace Conference is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 8th, at which time the report of the Rules Committee will be approved and invitations will be sent to the five former enemy states.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The Peace Conference held a plenary session today and adopted the rules proposed by the Rules Committee. The French Foreign Minister will serve as chairman during the first half of the meeting, and then, according to the alphabetical order, one of the five great powers will serve as chairman. According to the alphabetical order, the United Kingdom should be after France, but Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is more likely to serve as chairman because China is at the top of the alphabetical order, and the British Chief Representative, Bevin, has not yet arrived.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Stage of the Peace Conference Has Ended, and Formal Deliberations Have Begun. The Confrontation Between the Two Camps is Inevitable, Reflecting the Current Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The preparatory stage of the Paris Peace Conference ended today, but the main issues of the conference itself remain unresolved. The chief representatives of the twenty-one nations of the conference spent a full eight days deciding on the conference procedures. Although the procedures originally agreed upon by the four powers were subject to intense debate for eight days, they were not significantly altered. The Rules Committee decided that non-member states could be invited by the subcommittees to attend and present their views. In terms of voting rules, the committee decided that all motions passed by a two-thirds or majority vote of the conference would be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four powers for review. The so-called motions passed by a majority vote are, of course, of secondary importance. In addition, other amendments to the original procedures of the four powers were purely technical and insignificant. From this, it can be seen that all the representatives expended great effort and engaged in fierce verbal battles, but the results, although satisfactory, were not revolutionary, which is quite strange. It is generally believed that this is the first head-on confrontation between opposing groups. Each representative insisted on their position to the point of making mistakes, which shows that the latent forces of conflict still do not lose their ferocity in the Peace Conference. This is merely a reflection of the current situation in Europe. For example, at the meeting of the Rules Committee on the night of the 6th of this month, when discussing the two-thirds majority voting rule, the United Kingdom and France each proposed amendments that were similar in content, but the Soviet Union supported the French amendment. If the supporters of the British amendment had also supported the French proposal, then the French proposal could have been unanimously approved, but as a result, the French proposal was rejected by thirteen votes to eight, while the British amendment was adopted, but not unanimously. Some observers believe that the underlying motive for this division was to engage in a contest of wills with the Soviet delegation because the Soviet delegation, with the support of the Eastern countries, had opposed the British amendment to the end. The gap between East and West can be seen from this kind of voting. Moreover, this kind of gap exists everywhere in Europe today, especially in Austria. The development of the situation within Austria seems to be affecting the debates at the Paris Peace Conference. The disposal of former German assets within Austria is a matter on which the four powers have the most divergent views, and the Peace Conference will inevitably encounter major difficulties in this regard. For this reason, the observers were not overly enthusiastic about the agreement reached by the Procedural Committee. This agreement was in fact due to the skillful and appropriate management of the committee's chairman, Spaak.</p>
<h3>Truman and Byrnes Communicate by Radio</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] President Truman spoke with Byrnes by radio telephone for several minutes this morning. Byrnes reported to the President on the latest developments at the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Bevin Prepares to Attend the Peace Conference, Departure Date Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here said this morning: Foreign Secretary Bevin still intends to go to Paris tomorrow to attend the Peace Conference, but his departure plan has not been finalized. If the consultations on the Palestine issue enter a serious state, it may be delayed for several days. In fact, because the procedural stage of the Paris Conference has ended and the draft peace treaty will begin to be discussed, Bevin is eager to go as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Council of Foreign Ministers May Not Serve as Chairmen of the Peace Treaty Drafting Committee. Our Representative Agreed to Byrnes' Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] Byrnes proposed an amendment in the Rules Committee today, which was unanimously passed by the meeting. This amendment stipulates that member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers may not serve as chairman of any peace treaty drafting committee. At the same time, if a member of a country's delegation is elected chairman of a committee, other members of that country's delegation may not be appointed as chairman of another committee. Before Byrnes' aforementioned proposal was adopted, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie spoke, expressing his full agreement with Byrnes' proposal. Wang pointed out the ambiguity of China's position, because China had attended the London Council of Five Foreign Ministers, but not the subsequent Council of Foreign Ministers. Wang declared that, under any circumstances, China was willing to waive the right to be elected chairman of the committee.</p>
<h3>Byrnes' Assistants Will Depart for Paris</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] The American radio station announced: Republican Senator Vandenberg and Democratic Senator Connally will depart for Paris this month to assist Byrnes, head of the American delegation to the Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Hosts a Banquet for Representatives of Various Countries and Lays a Wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] After the meeting of the Rules Committee on the evening of the 7th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie hosted a reception for guests from various countries at the Chinese Embassy, which was attended by 400 people. The delegations of the other twenty countries of the Peace Conference and the reporters covering the Peace Conference all received invitations. The Chinese reception was one of the few social occasions related to the Peace Conference so far. Byrnes held the first reception at the beginning of the Peace Conference. A few days later, the Yugoslav delegation issued an invitation to hold a similar reception, but it was canceled because the committee meeting on that day did not end until late at night.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Wang Shijie laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris this morning. Wang was accompanied to the Arc de Triomphe by Qian Tai, the Chinese ambassador to France, and several members of the Chinese delegation to the Peace Conference. He was welcomed by French General Petitjean, Paris garrison commander Lecuyer, and Dumenil, the director of protocol of the French Foreign Ministry. Wang and his party bowed to the French flag, and the military band played the national anthems of China and France. After the ceremony, the Chinese dignitaries signed the "Golden Book" as a memorial.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspapers Publish the Arguments of the American and Soviet Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 8th: When the American Secretary of State refuted Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference the other day, he said that Soviet newspapers had no freedom of speech and would not publish his speech. Molotov replied that they would definitely publish it. It is reported that Byrnes' speech has been published in Moscow newspapers, occupying the third page and part of the fourth page.</p>
<h3>The British Imperial Defense Plan Seeks to Adapt to the New Environment. Worried About the Extension of Soviet Power into India, It Attempts to Obtain a New Position in Tibet</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] A reporter for the New York Times said: The British, having learned from the lessons of the atomic bomb, feel that the scale of the next war will be greater than the previous two world wars. Therefore, the defense of the empire must adapt to this new environment. This is the motivation for Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's tour of various places. The British are particularly sensitive to certain key points of the empire's lifeline. The deployment of the Gibraltar fortress is actually related to the British and Soviet attitudes towards the Franco regime. In the eastern Mediterranean, the British are also afraid of Soviet power extending from Trieste, Tartary, or Greece. The growth of Egyptian national consciousness forces them to abandon their strongholds in the Nile River Valley. The unrest in Palestine will affect Britain's plans to establish new bases in the Middle East. Iraq has also recently demanded to sign a new treaty with Britain, and the unrest in Iran threatens the British oilfields in Iran equally. Further afield, the Russians seem to want to extend into India via Afghanistan, so Burma will become Britain's main base in the East, and Tibet will therefore acquire a new position of importance.</p>
<h3>Sketches of Peace Conference Personalities: The Cannonball Diplomats Show Their Skills, Driving Away Sleepiness in the Sultry Weather</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The sultry Luxembourg Palace is enough to make the representatives of the twenty-one countries feel very dull. If it were not for the eloquent speeches of the cannonball diplomats such as Molotov and Evatt, all the representatives would inevitably fall asleep. Evatt, known as the Australian Bevin, is one of the most active people in the Peace Conference. He often roams around the venue, looking for conversation partners. Everyone is familiar with this diplomat with broad shoulders, gray hair, and bright eyes, who always wears an ill-fitting blue suit. Evatt has given the most speeches since the Peace Conference began, and he is also the most attentive to the speeches of others. His personality is the opposite of the Belgian chairman Spaak, who has a solemn and dignified attitude, wears horn-rimmed glasses, and ties a bow tie. When the meeting is in session, he often supports one arm on the armrest of the chair, with his eyes fixed on the antique decorations on the ceiling, and sometimes he occasionally records the speeches of others, appearing very leisurely.</p>
<p>Molotov also appears very quiet when he is not speaking. He does not run around much, and prefers to share the "joy of the family" with his delegation. Twirling his mustache seems to be a habit he cannot change. His assistant, Ambassador to the UK Gusev, has an unfathomable face. Another assistant, Vyshinsky, is more active, but sitting next to Molotov, he seems not as active as he was at the United Nations Conference in London. Sitting opposite the Soviet delegation is Canadian Prime Minister King, wearing a pair of rimless glasses. When the interpreter is translating the speeches of others, unless it is English, he always fixes his gaze on the opposite wall. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is a tall and well-dressed gentleman, who speaks with a touch of humor. Sitting on the other side of the chairman is Indian representative Shia Gan, who is one of the most eye-catching in terms of clothing color, because he is wearing Indian dress. Chinese representative Wang Shijie's fluent, dignified, and cultured English draws the unanimous attention of the audience.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Italian Memorandum</h3>
<p>Protests on Several Issues</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 8th: The Italian delegation, without waiting for the official meeting of the twenty-one nations this Saturday, launched the struggle for amendments to the treaty with the former enemy countries today, submitting a memorandum including three points to the Peace Conference, protesting the border changes and economic terms between France and Italy. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's main goal in appealing is to maintain a gentler peace for Italy and to gain the support of Latin American countries and the sympathy of Britain and the United States. The main points of the memorandum are three: (1) A general review of all border disputes, including the promises made by de Gaulle and other senior French officials that France would never make territorial claims against Italy; (2) A request to retain the Roja River Valley (including the Tenda area) given to France by the four powers; (3) A request to retain the Mont Cenis district given to France by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four powers.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Comprehensively Stop Illegal Jewish Immigration, Completely Blocking the Mediterranean Coast, Seeking to Eliminate a Certain Underground "Oil Pipeline"</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] The British government has notified the United States that it will no longer allow illegal immigrants to enter Palestine, and that illegal immigrants will only be allowed to move to Cyprus in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Government sources said today: The British government is planning to comprehensively stop the illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine from Europe. As a result of cooperation between the army and navy, the Mediterranean coastline of Palestine may be completely blocked. The cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the Palestine issue for two hours, but no decision was announced. Chief of Staff Montgomery and representatives of the army, navy, and air force all attended the meeting. According to informed sources, today's cabinet meeting will likely push forward the New York action. At the same time, it was announced in Malta yesterday that the famous British cruiser "Ajax" had sailed from the island to Haifa. It is said that the ship's movement is not related to the British blockade plan. The land-based tasks of the overall plan will be carried out in concentration camps from Italy to Germany. The British army in the area will be ordered to step up control in order to eliminate a certain underground "oil pipeline" that has been constantly transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] There are a total of five Jewish refugee ships docked in Haifa, with a total of 1,500 refugees being prevented from landing. It is heard that there are two other refugee ships, carrying approximately 3,300 refugees, also en route to Haifa.</p>
<p>Another report states that the British army on Cyprus has set up 100 tents for housing Jews. Officials have not disclosed whether those who are to be housed are Jewish refugees or Jewish terrorists, nor when the housing will begin.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses the Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The British cabinet met for two hours this morning to discuss the Palestine issue. Well-informed sources predict that new proposals regarding Palestine will be put forward in the near future. The American government is still discussing the partition plan for Palestine in higher education. The previous rumor that President Truman expressed dissatisfaction with the plan has been formally denied by Treasury Secretary Snyder, a member of the cabinet's Palestine Committee.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Attends a Secret Meeting of the Military Advisory Group</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] General He Yingqin attended the secret meeting of the United Nations Military Advisory Group for the first time after General Shang Zhen. The group is still in the preliminary stage of secret discussions and has not made any response to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>My Witnesses Wang Lengzhai and Four Others Still Detained in Tokyo Awaiting Summons, Prosecutor Read Aloud the Timeline of Japanese Aggression Against China Yesterday, Records of Hata Shunroku and Matsui's Confessions Were Both Presented</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Far East International Tribunal, in order to try key war criminals such as Tojo, specially invited incumbent military and political leaders at the time of the Japanese invasion of China, as well as witnesses or parties involved in the atrocities of the Japanese army, to testify in court. It is now known that among those invited from our country to testify, in addition to Mr. Wang Lengzhai, Liang Tingzhao, Tong Shoumin, and Chen Dashou who are still in Tokyo, Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Decun, Sun Ji, Xu Chuanyin, Xu Fanjun, Shang Deyi, Wu Changde, and Dong Fufeng have all returned to the country one after another.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Former adjutant to the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army, Muto, testified in the International Court today that Commander Matsui was deeply concerned that after the Japanese army entered Nanjing, rape and looting would be inevitable, so he ordered that only elite troops be allowed to enter the city, but this order was not enforced. Matsui later heard that the Japanese army had indeed committed rape and looting, and he roared at his subordinates. Muto also stated that only "ten or twenty incidents" occurred in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 8th] In recent days, the prosecutors of the International Tribunal have continued to summon witnesses and present evidence, trying to prove from various aspects that Japan's military actions in China were not Japan's defensive war, but a war of aggression. Today, prosecutor Moro first read aloud the "Timeline of Japanese Military Aggression Against China," followed by the presentation of the confession record of defendant Hata Shunroku, which stated: "I succeeded General Matsui as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Expeditionary Army from February to November 1938, and then succeeded General Nishio as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army from 1941 to 1944. After Matsui captured Nanjing, I was dispatched to China with the main goal of peaceful work in the occupied areas. From 1941 to 1944, 50,000 Japanese soldiers died in China, and about 200,000 were injured. At the time of surrender, I was serving as the commander of the Second Army stationed in Hiroshima and was injured in the head by the atomic bomb, and have not fully recovered." Then, Matsui's confession record was presented, in which he flatly denied the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Giant Map Hanging on the Wall</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] This morning, the Far East International Tribunal hung a giant map of our country behind the defendant's enclosure to show the various stages of Japan's aggression against our country. The nine maps of our country hanging showed the situation of battles fought on our country's territory over the years, and were marked in red to show the territory occupied by Japan in each period. All the defendants craned their necks to watch.</p>
<h3>US Army Secretary Patterson Flies to the Pacific Region</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 7th] A C-54 transport plane carrying US Army Secretary Patterson and twelve officials of the War Department flew from Washington to the Pacific region today, making a temporary stop at Hamilton Airport. According to people at the airport, the destination and mission of Mr. Patterson and others are kept secret.</p>
<h3>American Journalism School: The Pastoral Scenery of Missouri - Hometown of President Truman</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent to the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>[Kansas City, Yamoyue 13th Airmail] The morning business districts of the United States are concentrated in two main parts. One is along the Great Lakes, represented by the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana, and the other is the Mississippi River, represented by the states of Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana. Missouri is located between the North and South of the United States. During the Civil War, Missouri was the part of "balancing the balance." Even now, the "racial boundary" between blacks and whites in Missouri is neither as harsh as in the South nor as enlightened as in the North. Americans, especially those in the big cities of New York and Chicago, regard Missourians from "the fields" as rustic "country bumpkins." In fact, Americans in Missouri are indeed more honest, simple, and kind than in other places, and also more "country" than anywhere else. Their lifeline is agriculture.</p>
<p>They are content with the natural order of agricultural society. Before World War II, San Francisco once held a national American "exposition" of products. The products sent by Missouri were ears of wheat four inches long. The people in charge of the exposition and the audience all praised Missouri's agricultural products, but they also found the representatives from Missouri to be adorably rustic, so they all joked with him. The representative from New York: "What's so rare about your four-inch-long ears of wheat? We have six-inch-long ones in New York!" This was a joke, but the "country representative" believed it to be true. He followed the representative from New York and shouted, "Show me!" The representative from California found it really funny and interjected, "What's so great about six inches long? In California, eight-inch-long ears of wheat are nothing!" The Missouri representative immediately held out his hand and said, "Show me!" Now, "Show me!" has become a general nickname for Missourians.</p>
<p>Whether in the army or in international metropolises, when Americans meet Americans, after asking their names, if one side says "Missourian," the other side will naturally say "Show me!", just like saying "old hen" when seeing someone from Hefei in China. Missourians are not ashamed of being ridiculed by others. They can never change their simple and kind nature. On the contrary, they feel it is necessary to preserve this kind of nature. Historically, the state of Missouri has never had "earth-shattering" political figures. This time, Truman became the current president, and Missourians were unprecedentedly happy, but their simple personality often pushed their reason. Many Chinese students study at the University of Missouri. When asked what their local classmates thought of Truman becoming president, almost all the students were consistent. They believed that "Harry (Truman's nickname) is an honest person, but not very suitable to be president." On my way from St. Louis to Kansas City, I stayed overnight in the small town of Columbia. In the hotel and on the road, I asked them if they knew President Truman? They all said as if they were very close: "Oh, Harry, we know him, he is a good man!" Missourians believe this is the success of their honest society. Anyone who has been to Missouri, whether a visitor from another place or a foreigner, looking at their peaceful agricultural society, looking at their fertile fields and fragrant rice, you will definitely feel the loveliness of this pastoral life. In Missouri, prices are half as cheap as in New York. A few friends who study journalism at the University of Missouri can rent a bright and clean comfortable upper room for less than twenty dollars a month, and have their meals at the old lady next door for five and a half dollars a week, eating large pieces of pork or beef every day. This kind of cheap life is unimaginable for people accustomed to living in New York and Chicago. Missouri's agricultural society is rich thanks to the irrigation of the rivers. The Mississippi River is in the east, and the Missouri River runs through the entire state. Although the entire state of Missouri is full of hills, the slopes and valleys have become the best producing areas for crops. Once the car leaves St. Louis City and goes straight west along National Highway 40, it is all undulating hilly terrain. After driving more than 130 miles, you will reach Columbia. Columbia is not the capital of Missouri. The capital of Missouri is in Jefferson City, 31 miles south of Columbia. Because it is not on a major transportation route, and I heard that the capital is pitifully small, I did not go sightseeing. Columbia gets its name entirely from the University of Missouri. The entire city has only 18,000 residents. Including the students of the University of Missouri, there are only about 30,000 people. The current president of the University of Missouri, Mr. Middlebush, is a famous political economist in the United States, but the University of Missouri is not famous for political economy, but for the School of Journalism and Agriculture. The School of Journalism occupies two buildings. The basement of Neff Hall is the typesetting room and printing room; the second floor is the dean's office, editing and defense department; and the third floor is the advertising room and showroom. The basement of Williams Hall is the photography studio; the second floor is the editorial office, business office, and typing practice room; and the third floor is the library of the School of Journalism. I only visited the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri for three hours, but based on my personal feelings, I think the success of journalism education at the University of Missouri is entirely due to the integration of theory and practice. The School of Journalism runs the only daily newspaper "The Missourian" in this small city, with specially set up printing rooms, and specially hired printing workers from outside. Students take turns writing editorials, editing news, and reporting news. What they write, edit, and report is published in their own newspaper every day. Clipping and compiling them becomes the grade for the semester. The University of Missouri also teaches journalism theory and "History of Journalism." The current dean, Mr. Mott, is a eloquent speaker of theory. I did not meet Dean Mott. Associate Director Sharpe talked to me about many anecdotes of Chinese students at the Missouri School of Journalism. Many former Chinese students are now seniors or well-known figures in the Chinese news industry. In the reception room on the second floor of the School of Journalism, I saw the couplet that Mr. Wang Yingbin gave to the "alma mater" of Missouri, the mirror frame that Mr. Shao Yuanchong wrote to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the School of Journalism, and the screen couplet that Mr. Kong Yongzhi wrote to the School of Journalism in the name of the President of Yenching University. The East Row room of the School of Journalism displays many ancient paintings related to the news industry in the East. The "Pass" issued by the Jiangsu Governor's Office to Klaus, a reporter for the Shanghai Continental Daily, on January 6th of the Republic of China, allowing him to go to various cities to interview news and "enter and exit the city gates," is hung on the wall. It is said that this pass was personally approved by the Provisional President Sun Yat-sen. In addition, the souvenirs given by the Japanese to the Missouri School of Journalism are very numerous. Viscount Shibusawa of Japan has photos and poems inscribed on them, and Fumio Kuno, the chairman of the Tokyo Mita Journalism Society, also has a piece of writing hanging in the showroom.

<h3>The Business Community Places Great Hopes! The Petition Group Went to the Capital Last Night, Hoping the Government Would Seize the Opportunity to Provide Emergency Relief Quickly, All Industries Held a Tea Party Yesterday Afternoon to See Them Off</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] A group of forty-seven members of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Petition Group, jointly initiated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association, led by five general representatives, Wu Yun-chu, Jin Run-xiang, Shou Liang-wei, Ge Jie-chen, and Yang Guan-bei, took the evening train to the capital last night at ten o'clock. They are scheduled to stay in the capital for three days and will petition separately to seven agencies: the National Government, the Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the Supreme National Defense Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Nearly Fifty Members Participated</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the various trade associations of the City Chamber of Commerce held a special tea party in the Chamber's meeting hall to see off the members of the petition group. About one hundred people attended, including various members, representatives of various trade associations, and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Zhu Shangyi gave a speech first, stating briefly that the industrial and commercial sectors have now reached a critical juncture of life and death. The success or failure of this petition trip is related to the success or failure of the entire industrial and commercial sectors. He hoped that all members would work hard to request the authorities to accept the opinions of the industrial and commercial sectors to rescue them from the depths of misery. Then, Mr. Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, reported on the preparations for the petition group and stated that as of now, forty-seven members have participated. The petition group also asked Mr. Tao Guilin to go to the capital three days ago to deploy everything. It is also heard that representatives from the chambers of commerce in Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Wuxi will gather in the capital today.</p>

<p>The Main Points of the Petition Each Have Four Points</p>
<p>As for the main points of the petition, the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association each have four points. In addition to a separate submission from each, the Chamber of Commerce also has a joint submission. Each trade association also has a submission, and six have been received so far. In addition to appointing Wu Yun-chu and four others as general representatives to the outside world, Mr. Tian Heqing and Wang Jianping have been appointed as general directors internally. In addition, they are expected to return to Shanghai on the 11th. After Mr. Yan finished his speech, Mr. Tian Heqing, representing the Industrial Association, reported on the four major principles of the association's petition this time: (1) Expedite emergency industrial loans. According to statistics, 30 of the 45 industrial associations in this city intend to apply for loans, and the amount of loans requested reaches more than 156 billion yuan. Including the 13 associations that have not yet sent letters, the estimated amount of loans will exceed 200 billion yuan. (2) Coordinate labor-management disputes: (A) Implement the minimum wage law, (B) Safeguard the administrative management rights of factories, (C) Factories have the freedom to shut down. (3) Industrial rehabilitation: Ensure that all factories are rehabilitated uniformly, and priority should be given to purchasing enemy and puppet factory production tools and intact raw materials. (4) Industrial subsidies: (A) Implement a tax refund policy, (B) Allocate raw materials, power, and transportation tools at low prices.</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua Arrived Despite Being Ill</p>
<p>At 5:30, Chairman Luo Qinghua arrived at the meeting place despite being ill and gave a speech on the spot, stating briefly: "I am very sorry that I cannot accompany the petition group due to my illness. The petition group's action was decided at the general meeting of all members of the Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd of last month. This trip is of historical significance, with an unprecedented task and a significant and urgent meaning. The crisis in the industrial and commercial sectors is getting worse every day, and factories are closing down every day. We cannot ignore this situation. After the rehabilitation, I have been in contact with the government authorities and the industrial and commercial sectors. Government officials are not unaware of the industrial and commercial crisis a month ago. There are roughly two views: First, it is believed that the current crisis is caused by the country's participation in the eight-year war of resistance, which has severely damaged its economic capacity. Therefore, the crisis is due to natural causes and cannot be remedied by human power. The main response is to wait for the solution of political problems, and then the economy can gradually recover. Therefore, all efforts are focused on tightening credit, in the hope that as a result of tightening, fiscal revenue and expenditure can be balanced. Therefore, industrial loans are tight, industrial production is shrinking accordingly, materials are becoming scarcer, and currency is increasing, resulting in the opposite effect, and the gap between revenue and expenditure is widening. On the other hand, it is believed that there are two destinations for currency: those used for production and construction should be expanded as much as possible, and those used for ordinary consumers should be tightened. The government's various necessary and huge expenditures, such as civil servants' new allowances, may consider replacing some with in-kind. If policies are implemented according to this principle, it is hoped that a true balance of revenue and expenditure can be achieved. However, these two arguments have not yet been coordinated. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors, as a third party who has experienced the situation, should now have something to say. The problem of political consultation at the current stage has a feeling that it is impossible to talk about. The crisis in the economic and industrial and commercial sectors is approaching day by day. If it collapses, what will happen to the country and social order? Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government authorities will adopt a determination to save lives rather than save the dead for the industrial and commercial sectors. It is now known that the number of people in the government who sympathize with the situation of the industrial and commercial sectors is increasing day by day. The industrial and commercial sectors should give full support to this sympathy. Therefore, it is hoped that the petition group will earnestly and concisely present two points to the government on this trip: (1) The problem has reached the most serious stage, (2) The time has come to the final moment. If the government fails to seize the opportunity to provide emergency relief, the entire industrial and commercial sectors will be in an irretrievable situation. In the past, the government lacked a comprehensive economic policy and only had an erroneous fiscal policy, which led the monetary policy to go astray. This petition trip should urge the government to change the past erroneous policies to correct policies. Therefore, this trip is of historical significance. At the same time, the motives of the petition group are pure, and the purpose is to address the matter, not the people. And absolutely support the government, hoping that the government will quickly resolve the current difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors." Finally, Shou Jingwei, Pan Shihao, Ma Shaoquan, and others made separate statements, and the meeting ended at 6:30.</p>
<p>Full List</p>
<p>It has been reported that Wu Ouchu, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jiechen, and Yang Guanbei are the five general representatives, Tian Heqing and Wang Jianping are in charge of internal affairs, and the list of the remaining thirty-nine people is as follows: Pan Shihao, Tu Kaiwei, Cai Xintao, Xu Ziwei, Tao Guilin, Yan Esheng, Jiang Jiabao, Han Zhicheng, Huang Nongtang, You Kanyuan, Ye Shichang, Liang Songling, Zhang Shanqiu, Kuang Fengshao, Wu Xingcha, Shen Jien, Wang Bingjun, Guo Zifu, Zhu Xiaofang, Fang Runlin, Song Baolin, Tong Shengyu, Zhou Songchang, Yao Yuen, Zhong Keto, Zhong Shanguo, Chen Laiguo, Shen Fengshi, Wu Daming, Yuan Xiaolian, Sun Yujun, Xie Xing, Wu Zhijun.</p>
<h3>A Major Fire at Dayouyu Oil Factory, Losses Exceed 600 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Dayouyu Oil Factory at No. 36 West Suzhou River Road in Shanghai's West End is large in scale. Yesterday afternoon at 4:50, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's old workshop due to a short circuit. At that time, the wind was very strong, and the fire spread very quickly, affecting the L.G. cargo warehouses on the west side. One warehouse stored 80,000 sacks, and another warehouse stored 5,000 bags of soybeans and 3,000 bags of cottonseed, all of which were burned down. When the fire was raging, the Yichang Road Fire Department and the Central District and other fire departments arrived one after another to connect water and put out the fire. Unfortunately, the fire was already strong, and the sacks, soybeans, cottonseed, oil, and other items stored inside the warehouse were all flammable, so it was not easy to extinguish. It was not until 9:30 in the evening that the fire gradually subsided, but the embers were still there. Even until 2 o'clock this morning, the fire truck had not left to prevent the embers from rekindling. Afterwards, according to the factory manager Xue Runsheng, the total losses exceeded 600 million yuan, and some machinery was also burned down, but the goods were insured for a huge amount in Tianyi Taiping and other insurance companies.</p>
<p>Another report: The paper warehouse on the second floor of Xu Shengji Printing Factory at No. 175 Hart Road was also burned down at 5:04 yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Case of Returning Materials to Capital Factories, the Investigation Team is Currently Investigating</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Wu Wangji, a member of the Receival and Investigation Team, to inquire about the case of Sun Tianchangzhi, a Korean arms dealer, mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. According to him, the investigation team is conducting an investigation into this case. Before the entire case is decided, they are unwilling to express any opinions. However, this case is of great importance, and it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan if necessary. As for this type of case, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and the Review Committee should be responsible, at least for the delay. However, the investigation team is determined to proceed with the handling as soon as possible. Another report: There have been many criticisms from various parties regarding the situation of the receiving office of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area. The Executive Yuan has instructed them to submit a detailed report for verification. It is heard that the office has complied with the order to submit a report.</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Labor Association Incident: Zhu Xuefan Reports the Course of Events, Makes Four Appeals to All Sectors to Uphold Justice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association, and several welfare organizations such as the hospital run by the Association in Chongqing, being forcibly occupied by over two hundred plainclothes personnel and armed police officers on the morning of the 8th of this month, with over twenty staff members of the Association detained, a reception for reporters from various newspapers in the city was held yesterday afternoon. Firstly, Mr. Zhu Xuefan of the Association reported, stating briefly that the Association had been established for ten years, and after moving to Shanghai in February this year, due to practical needs, various undertakings run in Chongqing, such as the workers' welfare agency, labor hospital, nursery, worker cultural service team, and worker schools (eight in total), were continued. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 AM on August 6th, over two hundred plainclothes personnel and armed police forcibly occupied these institutions and the Chongqing office of the Association simultaneously. At that time, traffic was cut off, the situation was serious, and over twenty staff members of the Association were detained. Patients in the labor hospital were also not allowed to leave. These armed personnel claimed to be acting on orders, and the fact that these several organizations, which were quite far apart, were occupied simultaneously indicated that this was not something that could be done by a small number of people, but a planned action.</p>
<p>About two weeks before this incident, the "Labor Voice" newspaper, run by Deng Faqing, a director of the Chongqing General Labor Union, published news falsely accusing the Labor Association of plotting an assassination group. However, upon investigation, the person in charge of the Association in Chongqing, the director of the Ciyou Orphanage, Ms. Zhou Ying, is a graduate of the Central Political School, and the director of the Labor Hospital, Dr. Zhao Suyuan, is a student who studied in Canada and is a Christian. Both are resolutely not involved in political activities or plotting to incite labor unrest.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu continued: Not only has the Association never incited labor unrest, but it has also made every effort to assist the government in resolving labor disputes. For example, in August of last year, it assisted in resolving seven labor disputes, twenty-nine in September, thirty-six in October, thirty-seven in November, thirty-eight in December, seventeen in January of this year, and eighteen in February (after March, it moved to Shanghai). As for the handling of donations, not only have the accounts been thoroughly audited by the Lixin and Gongxin accounting firms, but the use of funds at ordinary times must also be approved by the US labor community relief fund supervisory committee. All account books are available for review. The Association is a legal organization that has assisted in the war of resistance for ten years, promoted increased production, and strived to improve the status of workers. Today, it has suffered this unexpected blow. Therefore, it appeals to all sectors to uphold justice and puts forward four demands: (1) Request the release of the detained personnel of the Association; (2) Investigate the instigators of this incident; (3) Request the government to protect human rights, ensure the safety of staff, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future; (4) Demand that those who forcibly occupy these institutions withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, a representative of the US labor community relief fund supervisory committee, stated that the committee is a supervisory body in name and in fact. After the relief fund arrives in China, it is first deposited with the supervisory committee. When the Labor Association uses funds, it must first prepare a budget, which must be approved by the committee and then transferred to the United States for approval by the donating organization before it can be issued. If the Labor Association's use of funds is not related to worker welfare and the war of resistance, the supervisory committee will naturally not consider it. The Labor Association's accounts are now all stored in the supervisory committee. This spring, the accounts were also published in the newspaper once, and there is indeed nothing unaccountable for.</p>
<p>In response to reporters' inquiries, Mr. Zhu Xuefan stated that the Chongqing workers have no faith in the "General Labor Union" responsible by Deng Faqing and others, and have formed their own labor unions and joined the Labor Association. He himself will go to Nanjing this week to appeal to the authorities.</p>
<h3>The Rong Family's Two Brothers Are Accused of Embezzlement: Shenxin Capital Stock Causes Entanglements</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Rong Erren, the son of Rong Desheng, and his nephew Rong Hongyuan (son of Rong Zongjing), have recently been sued by Ding Ziren from Wuxi for embezzlement. The case was heard in the fourth criminal court of the local court yesterday. It is reported that Ding and the Rong family were originally relatives. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), they jointly took over the Hengchangyuan Yarn Factory on Yichang Road and renamed it Shenxin No. 2 Factory. At that time, the total capital was 500,000, with Ding holding 100,000. Ding also served as general manager. Later, due to old age and weakness, he handed over the position of general manager to Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Erren took over as manager. Now, Ding accuses the Rong brothers of gradually transferring Ding's capital stock to their own accounts after taking over. At the beginning of the partnership, because they were relatives, there was no written agreement, only a note in the capital account. However, the capital account has been hidden, it is said. Yesterday, Ding himself did not appear, but entrusted a lawyer to appear in court. The two defendants also did not appear. According to the lawyer representing them, Rong Erren is currently in the United States, and Rong Hongyuan was unable to attend due to business. The case may be settled out of court, and the court is requested to postpone the hearing. The case was therefore adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhao Meibo and Others Return to Shanghai: Music Community Hosts Tea Party to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Amidst the vigorous development of the Shanghai music movement, dozens of famous musicians who had participated in the war of resistance in the interior, including Zhao Meibo, Liu Xue'an, and Wu Bochao, have returned to Shanghai one after another. The Shanghai Music Association held a welcome tea party at the Nanyang Garden yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Ding Shande. Huang Yuanyin and Ma Sihong, members of the music visiting delegation who recently visited Nanjing, were also present. (It is noted that the visiting delegation is about to depart for Southeast Asia and the United States.) It was the first grand gathering of the Shanghai music community after the victory, with famous musicians from home and abroad gathered together. Director Xu of the Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra also reported on the orchestra's recent situation at the end of the meeting, and the entire audience applauded after the speech. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng Interrogated Continuously: Investigating How Much Property He Has</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and his family has applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. However, there has been no referral for a new hearing to date. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Yuan was brought from prison because the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau requested the High Court to investigate Yuan's property. Judge Qiu Huan-ying opened the hearing at 4:30 PM, asking only about the shares of the Huacheng Tobacco Company and the Red Cotton Restaurant. Yuan stated: "I have forty shares in the Huacheng Tobacco Company, each share worth ten yuan. Dai Gengxin is the chairman of the board, and I serve as a consultant in name. I have 10,000 yuan in shares in the Red Cotton Restaurant, which were gifted shares. I was also elected as a director, and Sheng Pihua is the chairman." The interrogation ended in less than ten minutes, and he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs. Also, the day before yesterday morning, Yuan was once again brought from prison for questioning about the shares of the Nanjing Central Hotel. Yuan replied that he had transferred them to others several years ago.</p>
<h3>A Group of Bloodless Demons: Assisted Japanese Enemies in Various Behind-the-Scenes Espionage Activities: Twenty-Three German War Criminals Scheduled to Stand Trial Starting on the 15th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Twenty-three German war criminals have been prosecuted by the US Military Judiciary and are scheduled to formally stand trial between the 15th and 20th of this month.</p>
<p>According to the US military's investigation, the activities of the German Fifth Column in China began long before the outbreak of the Pacific War. These Fifth Columns concealed their true faces under the guise of merchants and diplomatic envoys. Because although the Germans had previously helped China train its army, when the opportunity arose to find an ally in the Far East, they chose Japan. However, the Germans were also very cunning. They also considered the possibility of China's ultimate victory, so they decided to remain ostensibly friends of China, while secretly agreeing with the Japanese to help Japan with despicable behind-the-scenes activities to harm China. Formally, they did not fire a single shot at the Chinese, but in reality, they caused even greater damage to China. The bombing of the wartime capital Chongqing was the result of these "trusted" Germans who traveled between Chongqing and Shanghai. They told the Japanese in detail about Chongqing's air defense facilities. It can be said that Chongqing's becoming the most severely bombed city in the world was mainly due to their contribution.</p>
<p>Behind-the-Scenes Activities to Probe Military Intelligence</p>
<p>This kind of behind-the-scenes espionage activity reached a new climax after Ayssener arrived in China in 1942. Ayssener, also known as Ohard, the first criminal now being prosecuted, had previously engaged in Fifth Column work in the Balkans and achieved remarkable results. After arriving in China, he first appeared as a businessman, and then as a member of the Shanghai Embassy, actually serving as the head of the "Ohard Bureau." Under his leadership, the main persons in charge of the North China branch were Verchler and Hiesch, whose tasks were: (1) to collect information related to the US military landing in China, (2) to report on the Chinese government's intelligence and political and military trends, and to provide them to the Japanese through the Embassy and Headquarters in Shanghai, (3) to report on the intelligence of Yan'an and the political and military trends of the Chinese Communist Party, (4) to report on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, the supply of materials, air and sea transportation, and military trends. In addition to this, there were four secondary goals: (1) the actions of the US Air Force in North China, (2) the activities of the US naval fleet, (3) the relationship between Chongqing and Yan'an, (4) the supply situation of the Chinese army through the Xi'an line, (5) the supply situation of Free China through the Lanzhou line.</p>
<h3>Key Criminal Hess Was Originally a Military Advisor</h3>
<p>As for the intelligence provided by the Ohard Bureau to the Japanese in Shanghai and other places, it included the routes of the US air transport team and the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for transporting supplies, the movement of troops, the location of guerrillas, the movements of the US fleet and escorts, and the location of Allied warships injured in the war zone. In addition, under the command of the German naval attaché in Tokyo, the Ohard Bureau colluded with the Embassy, commercial institutions, and the German-China Bank in China to smuggle tungsten ore, currency, and other important materials to supply the Nazi war machine.</p>
<p>And when the Japanese repeatedly attempted to negotiate peace with China in the later stages of the war but failed, they planned to divide China province by province, starting with Guangxi, then Yunnan, and then Sichuan. The Ohard Bureau also fulfilled the role of "intermediary" in the implementation of this conspiracy. Hess, one of the key war criminals, had been serving as a military advisor to China for many years and knew many Guangxi generals. He voluntarily offered to take on this task, and in fact, he did carry it out, but the conspiracy ultimately failed due to the loyalty and firmness of the people he contacted.</p>
<p>After Germany surrendered, they continued to engage in this destructive work. They desperately hoped that rifts would occur among the United Nations and that Japan would achieve final victory. From diplomatic personnel to businessmen, they contributed all their strength and materials to assist Japan until Japan surrendered.</p>
<p>US Military Court's Indictment</p>
<p>Now, from Ohard to the twenty-three war criminals, large and small, have been imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Prison awaiting trial. The main text of the US Military Judiciary's indictment against them is as follows: "Between May 8 and August 15, 1945, when the United States and Japan were still at war, Germans residing in China, including Ayssener (alias Ohard), Sieberg, Gericke, etc., respectively, in their capacity as German officials, nationals, citizens, spies, and employees, continued to engage in conscious and purposeful military activities that were illegally detrimental to the United States and its allies, undermining Germany's unconditional surrender. By providing, authorizing, permitting, and not preventing various forms of assistance, news, intelligence, propaganda, and material expenses to the Japanese armed forces and their intelligence agencies, they engaged in treacherous acts of helping Japan wage war against the United States, undermining the laws and customs of war." These twenty-three people will soon appear in the US military court to receive their due punishment. At the end of this article, it seems necessary to briefly introduce their identities: (1) Ohard - Head, (2) Sieberg - Consul in Guangzhou, (3) Gericke - Secretary of the Consulate in Guangzhou, (4) Woto - Leader of the Nazi Party in South China, (5) Hess, (6) Ubri, (7) Niemen, (8) Rotlauf, (9) Hebernich, (10) Taeslev, (11) Sgenki, (12) Piski, (13) Mausberg, (14) Raski, (15) Verchler, (16) Hiesch, (17) Littell, (18) Kiger - All spies of the Ohard Bureau. (19) Huamen - Ambassador to the Puppet Government, (20) Strol - Director of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, (21) Lensh - Consul in Shanghai, (22) Pukaimai - Director of the Shanghai Intelligence Department, (23) Roman - Staff member of the Shanghai Intelligence Department.</p>
<h3>Xu Liqiu, Huang Qingzhong, and Others Scheduled to Be Sentenced on the 15th</h3>

Tao Shidaoci was brought to court yesterday to confront Fan, but both vehemently denied the accusations and claimed they did not know each other. All of the above cases were adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Radio Stations Still Broadcasting Today: Request for Temporary Suspension of Ban</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation suddenly ordered the closure of 54 private radio stations in this city starting today. The news caused panic among the private radio stations. To seek a compromise and remedy, representatives of the 26 banned private radio stations, after returning to Shanghai from petitioning in Nanjing, jointly visited Chairman Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee the day before yesterday, requesting mediation. Chairman Wu agreed to summarize the opinions and convey them to the Ministry of Transportation, requesting a temporary suspension of the closure. The delegation also petitioned the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday, with two main demands: (1) The approval standards for private radio stations are unfair, and it is difficult to ensure thorough re-examination of the equipment of each radio station. It is requested that a re-examination be conducted, and during the re-examination period, the order to stop broadcasting should be temporarily suspended. (2) After the suspension of broadcasting, permission should be granted for the priority opportunity to move the radio equipment to other locations. It is also learned that all private radio stations plan to continue broadcasting as usual today.</p>
<h3>Shipping Guild Holds Board of Directors Meeting</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Garrison Headquarters military court summoned Rong Desheng again yesterday morning, but Mr. Rong still did not appear in court.

<h3>Four Lawyers Allowed to Resume Practice Early After Proving They Were Involved in Underground Work</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to suspend the practice of lawyers who registered with the puppet court during the fall of Shanghai for one year, starting from September 3, the date of victory in the war of resistance last year. The Ministry of Justice has issued a notice to this effect. It is learned that the Ministry of Justice stipulates that "puppet" lawyers who wish to resume practice must submit an application to the Ministry for review, return their puppet certificates, and exchange them for new certificates. As for lawyers who were ordered to register with the puppet court during the war due to their involvement in underground work, including Liu Daokui, Yuan Yang'an, Wu Fuchu, and Li Lin, they have been proven by the Central Organization Department, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and the Resettlement Committee to the judicial authorities and have been allowed to resume practice early, without being subject to the one-year suspension restriction.</p>

<h3>Explosion of Eighteen Boxes of Film Raw Material: Large Fire Erupted in Pudong Warehouse, Resulting in Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At around 1:00 PM yesterday, a loud noise suddenly erupted in the machine room of Warehouse No. 9, West Wharf, Gonghexiang Pier, Qichang Warehouse, Pudong, and flames burst out fiercely. Fortunately, Zhao Longsheng, director of the Pudong District Fire Brigade, led more than 50 members in three vehicles to the scene to rescue the situation, which was extinguished after an hour. After the incident, it was found that eighteen boxes of movie film raw materials recently shipped from the United States had exploded due to exposure to the scorching sun.

<h3>Scramble for Wharf Materials Leads to Armed Clash Between Dockworkers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM at the second wharf of the China Merchants Bureau at the Outer Hongqiao area, over two hundred new and old dockworkers gathered, each armed with iron rulers and clubs, resulting in an armed clash. When both sides were engaged in a chaotic battle, police officers dispatched by the military police arrived to suppress and halt the fighting, but to no avail. Consequently, the military police fired warning shots, causing the workers to scatter and flee, with only over twenty individuals being apprehended. It is reported that the intense battle resulted in injuries to six workers, namely Xu Maotou, Cheng Liansheng, Shang Yanxiang, Wu Guchun, Ding Youde, and Wang Zaoshi, all of whom were sent to the hospital for treatment. Investigation reveals that the cause of this conflict stemmed from the Qingkou gang foreman Wang Fangding and the Jiangbei gang foreman Guan Jinshan competing for the work of transporting materials at the wharf. The China Merchants Bureau had originally entered into a contract with the Qingkou gang, but it was cancelled upon expiration. Starting from June 1st, a contract was signed with the Jiangbei gang, thus triggering the violent clash.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Automobile Assembly Plant Assembles Thirty New Cars Daily</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA) hosted members of the Shanghai press yesterday morning for a tour of the automobile assembly plant of ERRCA's Highway Transport Brigade (formerly the British-owned public bus factory on Kang Nao Tu Road). The plant is divided into two sections: assembly and repair. The assembly section specializes in assembling automotive parts shipped by UNRRA into complete vehicles. According to a technician at the plant, the cars currently being assembled are all Dodge trucks with a payload of five tons. The car bodies, engines, canopies, wheels, and tires are all shipped from the United States. With the coordinated work of forty-eight workers, one vehicle can be completed every two hours. Currently, the plant assembles approximately twenty-five to thirty vehicles per day. The plant is very well-equipped, with large lathes, cranes mounted on vehicles, welding equipment, and more. There are many boxes of automotive parts shipped by UNRRA piled up. Representatives from the Executive Yuan reported that ERRCA currently has such assembly plants in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which are dedicated to maintaining and repairing vehicles for transportation teams in various locations.

<h3>Improving Transportation: Planning a Joint Public-Private Bus Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In March of this year, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau sent a letter to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, stating that if it did not promptly restore the old routes, the Public Utilities Bureau would consider other measures. Disregarding the contract, the Public Utilities Bureau would operate public buses in the areas and routes served by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, or organize another company to operate them. However, to date, the Public Utilities Bureau has not received any response. Currently, the Public Utilities Bureau has drafted two measures to improve transportation: (1) To utilize as many currently operational vehicles as possible (such as the received vehicles and the trucks provided by the Executive Yuan Materials Supply Bureau), (2) To establish another public bus company, based on the principle of joint public-private operation. As for the specific proportions of public and private investment, it is currently unknown. It is currently in preparation, and negotiations are underway with the Bank of Communications to raise private and public shares.</p>
<h3>Prison Life Is Good? Establishing a Painting and Calligraphy Society, Organizing a Club: Yuan Ludeng Relaxes, Claims It's a Rare Opportunity for Quiet Recuperation</h3>
<p>By chance, this reporter had a several-minute conversation with Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," who is sixty-seven years old.</p>
<p>Like most elderly people in the summer, he was wearing a white silk long gown, black cloth shoes, and holding a folding fan with calligraphy and painting.</p>
<p>When asked about his thoughts on being sentenced to life imprisonment, he smiled wryly and remained silent for a long time. Later, he suddenly told the reporter that a month ago, several friends had submitted a petition to the Supreme Court on his behalf, and the Ningbo Association had also made a request. He sighed softly and ended with the phrase, "Everyone will understand in the future," seeming to express regret for the "lack of understanding" from the outside world.</p>
<p>The topic turned to Wen Lanting's refusal to leave prison for trial. He said that Wen Lanting had stated in court during the first investigation hearing at the High Prosecutor's Office that he would no longer appear in court and that a judgment could be made in absentia. He still maintains this position. If they insist on dragging him to court, he will not answer a single question in court. Some time ago, Wen Lanting was suffering from a toothache, so his health was not good. Now that his tooth has been extracted, he has recovered in the past few days.</p>
<p>The reporter asked if there was a dentist in the prison. He replied that they have everything. Zhou Bangyan (general manager of Sino-Western Da Changfang) and former "Health Bureau Chiefs" Yuan Junchang and Yuan Jufan are all there, down to barbers and chiropodists.</p>
<p>"It's like a quiet recuperation, this is also a rare opportunity," he seemed to be consoling himself, saying that in the past, he was busy with everything, with many engagements every day, rushing to four or five places for dinner, drinking yellow wine here and beer there. Fortunately, my body is good, so I never see a doctor, this is God's blessing.</p>
<p>Wen Lanting Chants Scriptures and Meditates, Lin Kanghou Reads and Writes</p>
<p>Prison life is quite comfortable. Everyone has their own room. Wen Lanting now chants scriptures and meditates every day. Lin Kanghou reads and writes, also very leisurely. Although Liang Hongsheng has been sentenced to death, he is very calm. He is now busy writing and painting. Cai Pei and Xu Jidun and others have even gathered more than twenty people to establish a painting and calligraphy society and are now planning to organize a club.</p>
<p>He finally talked about his experience of entering prison, saying that on September 27th of last year, someone came to his house and said that Mr. Dai wanted to talk to him. Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and others were already there, so he went with them to Yuyuan Road. He didn't see Mr. Dai there. At that time, Wen Lanting stated that he would not take a drop of water. After some explanation, everyone stayed there. Later, they moved to Fulvli Road, and then some people moved to the South City. During this period, he only saw Mr. Dai once. Soon after, he was taken here.</p>
<p>The reporter asked if he read newspapers in prison. He shook his head and answered directly and frankly, "I don't read a single newspaper, I don't want to read them."</p>
<p>A photographer ran over to take a picture of him. He sat up straight and said to the photographer, "You can take it. There are many pictures of me outside, even signed ones."</p>

<h3>Li Jinxi to Take Over as Head of the Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Beiping] According to Li Jinxi, President of the National Northwestern Normal College and Standing Committee Member of the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Promotion Committee, he will be the Chief Director of the Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary. Currently, he will not return to the Northwest this year to focus on the takeover and restoration work of the office. The affairs of the National Northwestern Normal College in Lanzhou are being handled by Secretary Yi Jia as his representative.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] The Editorial Office of the Chinese Grand Dictionary was established in July 1928 by order of the Ministry of Education and was affiliated with the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Promotion Committee (formerly the Mandarin Unification Preparatory Committee). The government allocated the four western courtyards of Juren Hall in Zhongnanhai, Beiping, as the office's location. In July 1937, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Mandarin Promotion Committee moved inland with the government. The office, due to the large amount of materials and books, was unable to move to the rear and was thus suspended. In 1938, the puppet "Provisional Government" established a puppet "Ministry of Education." To put on a show, it forcibly took over the National Peiping Library, the Palace Museum, the Historical Exhibition Hall, and the office under its direct control. It also arbitrarily changed the office's name, deleting the character "Grand" and changing it to the "Chinese Dictionary Editorial Office." Because the number of staff remaining in the office was very small and their role was mainly custodial, the enemy and puppet authorities did not pay close attention. The office's index cards and books were thus fortunately preserved.</p>

<h3>Bao Officers in All Districts Temporarily Limited to Males</h3>
<p>Currently Serving Female Officers Transferred to District Service</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government considers Bao officers to be the backbone of local self-government, with complex affairs and heavy responsibilities. The regulations stipulate that only one full-time officer be assigned to each Bao office in the city. If personnel are not selected who are physically strong, mentally vigorous, and able to endure hardship, it will not be sufficient to cope with the situation. Due to physiological and physical reasons, women are not suitable for this position. It is now specifically stipulated that (1) the appointment of Bao officers in all districts is temporarily limited to males, and (2) currently serving female Bao officers should be transferred to district office clerk positions as soon as possible to emphasize local self-government. It is heard that the Civil Affairs Department has issued instructions to all district offices to comply.</p>
<h3>Answers to Questions Regarding Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(III) Personal Registration Category</p>
<p>(40) Question: In the folk custom, it is common to marry child brides. If they are registered as adopted daughters according to law, there are many disputes among the people. How should this be resolved?</p>
<p>Answer: Child brides should still be registered as adopted daughters according to law, and it should be noted in the remarks column that "planning to marry a certain son in the future." They should also be informed that on the day of consummation, they should apply for marriage registration again.</p>
<p>(41) Question: Registering child brides as adopted daughters seems to imply marriage between people with the same surname, which harms good social customs. Can it be changed to "foster care" registration?</p>
<p>Answer: Child bride is not a legal term, but it is a constant in custom. To determine their status, it can be handled by analogy with the adoption relationship. According to Article 1078 of the Civil Code, adopted children take the surname of the adopter. After consummation, the adoption relationship ends, and they should legally revert to their original surname. At the same time, according to Article 1000 of the Civil Code, they can be given the husband's surname or follow their agreement to marry with the same surname, which is not prohibited by law. And when the adoption relationship ends, the previous father-daughter or mother-daughter status no longer exists, and it does not harm good social customs, so there is no need to change it to "foster care" registration.</p>
<p>(42) Question: The investigation and filling in of the cause of death is quite difficult before the general establishment of health agencies. How should it be handled?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the investigation and filling in of the cause of death, according to the provisions of Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Revised Implementation Rules of the Household Registration Law, the local health agency should provide the necessary assistance. If there is a health agency in the area, the cause of death should still be filled in in detail. Where it has not been established, the classification of death causes such as illness, suicide, and execution can be adopted, which is easier to investigate and fill in, and conforms to the facts.</p>
<h3>Veterans Shall Not Be Forced to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently reported that the Rongyu (Veteran) soldier Guan Fusheng and others were forcing door-to-door donations. After sending personnel to investigate the details, the Municipal Government specifically issued an order to all district offices, stating: "The central government has established regulations for the preferential treatment of veteran soldiers. The certificate issued by this government to Guan Fusheng and others is to prove the identity of veteran soldiers, so that the Baojia organizations can provide preferential treatment in terms of accommodation and transportation. If Jie Wenli and others solicit donations from house to house, it is inappropriate. It is also inappropriate for the Baojia chiefs to accompany them."</p>
<h3>Twenty-Fifth District Distributes Flour Today</h3>
<p>The Twenty-Fifth District (Xin Jing) District Office convened a relief meeting of all Bao chiefs on the 5th to discuss the procedures for distributing flour.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>High Costs and Sluggish Sales - The Dyeing and Printing Industry is in Distress - Indigo Dyes in Black Market Worth 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to insiders in the dyeing and printing industry, in addition to facing the same pressure from high-interest loans and high wages as general industries, the dyeing industry is also experiencing a shortage of dyes, especially the non-fading Indigo dyes. It is reported that in the past few months, the Liquidation Department of the Defu Foreign Firm in this city still had a considerable amount of Indigo dyes for distribution. Although it cannot be said to be a large amount, it was still useful. Recently, the amount of distribution has gradually decreased, and there are rumors of shortages. The current distribution price of Indigo dyes is about 10 million yuan per burden. However, the black market price is around 20 million yuan, which greatly affects production costs. Although the United States also has substitutes such as Baoshailin, the output is not high. Orders placed in the first half of this year have not arrived yet. It is said that orders will not be accepted for the second half of the year. The shortage of dyes has become a considerable threat. If large-scale production resumes, this problem will become even more serious.</p>
<p>Currently, the sales of dyeing and printing industry products are sluggish due to the unrestored order and transportation obstacles in various regions, except for Guangbang, which has slightly improved. On the one hand, the dyeing and printing factories affiliated to the China Textile Construction Corporation also have a considerable amount of products, which are supplied to the market at low prices, so the product prices are also very flat. It is reported that currently, except for the printing business, which can still make a small profit, the dyeing business mostly loses money. Therefore, factories that rely solely on dyeing are complaining incessantly. Taking the common 190 Shilin cloth as an example, the market price is 80,000 yuan per bolt. The price of the grey cloth alone accounts for 52,000 yuan. The process from grey cloth to Shilin cloth takes an average of about two weeks. The labor, fuel, interest, transportation, sales, and management costs per bolt of dyed cloth are definitely not enough to be covered by 28,000 yuan. However, most factories currently have the pain of wanting to stop but being unable to do so. Because workers cannot be dismissed, they are forced to start work in order to maintain the livelihoods of their employees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to some manufacturers, the South Pacific region has excellent sales for various colored cloths and floral cloths, as the seasons are summer all year round, and the prices are also more reasonable than in China. However, due to the unrestored transportation in various regions of China, the customers from various regions cannot come to Shanghai to purchase, resulting in sluggish sales and falling market prices. On the other hand, production costs are increasing, making it necessary for dyeing and printing factories to reduce production. In this distressing situation, striving for the South Pacific market for yarn and cloth and increasing exports to stimulate production in various factories seems to be a win-win solution.</p>
<h3>Gold Notes Stable, Hong Kong Dollars in Strong Demand</h3>
<p>Gold prices were very stable yesterday, but the number of transactions was even lower, and the fluctuations were narrow. The morning opened at 1.918 million, and there was still strong demand from outside the industry. After opening, it rose to 1.935 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 1.915 million. Afterwards, there was a low price of 1.913 million. The process was mediocre. After a few gold shops absorbed it, it rose to between 1.92 million and 1.925 million at noon. Although there were few transactions in the afternoon, the stability was difficult to maintain for a long time. The bid price rebounded slightly, and the result was similar to the previous closing price. There was little change in silver jewelry and silver dollars. Private money lending turned flat, and supply and demand were balanced. Private interest rates ranged from one corner to one corner and two cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency: US dollars were flat and Hong Kong dollars were popular. US dollars opened at 2,530 yuan in the morning, and then fell slightly. The rumor that foreign currencies were not allowed to be used as collateral was still strong. There was little demand, and it once approached the 2,500 yuan mark. It was slightly stable at noon, hovering around 2,520 yuan. It was also stable in the afternoon, and the result was a slight increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Demand for Hong Kong dollars recovered, and the result rose by another 2 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rate was 550 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 665 yuan, and British exchange rate was 8,800 yuan. There were buyers, and the selling price increased by one level, and the situation became tighter. Transactions were slightly active, the listed price of the US exchange rate was still flat, and the bank's transaction was still sluggish due to stricter supply.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Chinese Stocks is Uncertain</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks wanted to advance, large investors did not have any activities and lacked encouragement. In addition, Meiya gave up at the close, affecting the overall situation, and the overall trend became uncertain again. Yong Yarn was raised from 700 yuan to 720 yuan, while Meiya fell from 4,230 yuan back to 3,950 yuan. San Xiao was the most popular in the middle of the hot streak, but opened and closed weakly. The futures market was one level lower than the spot market, which shows that people have no intention of pushing up prices. The futures interest rate was also reduced to one corner and five cents and one corner and a half. There was not much activity in the market except that Mr. Tong bought 560,000 shares of Yong Yarn. The result was a slight increase for Yong Yarn and a slight decrease for Meiya compared to the previous closing price. Jingfu and Xinguang each fell by 2 yuan, Qin Xing was still flat, the unpopular mid-sized stocks were flat and weak, and the small stocks continued to rise due to the early closing. The three old stocks fell slightly again.</p>
<p>There were still few foreign stock transactions, and the quotations of each stock were slightly different. Generally, they hovered around the previous day's price. However, the large stocks were temporarily weak, and the small stocks were still stable. The result was a slight decrease for Yisha, British United, Wheelock, and Asia compared to the previous closing price. Gangye rose slightly, and Yibei Paper, Yeguang Shangping were flat.</p>
<h3>The Bond Market is Full of Red Tickets</h3>
<p>It is difficult to expect public bonds to be revived. Operators are suppressing red tickets, and those who settle are scrambling to resolve them, so the proliferation is even worse. Buyers are wary. Tongbing fell from 660 yuan in the morning to 620 yuan before seeing stabilization. The result was a decrease of 50 yuan compared to the previous Muzha. Jia and Yi also fell by 20 yuan, Ding fell by 30 yuan, and E declined by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Small Denomination Notes Shall Not Be Refused</h3>
<p>Recently, a few banks and money shops in the market have refused to accept 50 yuan and 100 yuan notes on the grounds of being worthless. This matter concerns the entire financial system and the credit of legal tender. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Shanghai Banking Industry Association to accept the notes as usual without discrimination. The Shanghai Social and Financial Bureaus will also jointly issue a notice, ordering all banks, money shops, and other industries to comply.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 4,000 to 5,000 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern rice markets. Due to high production prices and impassable transportation, most vendors lost money. Therefore, the source of new goods was scarce. Retail sales in stores moved slightly, and japonica and indica rice continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The arrival of new japonica rice was also small, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Flour was sold off one after another in foreign sales, and people's confidence was shaken, causing a sharp drop of 400 to 500 yuan. The arrival of new soybeans continued, and the market was still sluggish. High-quality goods were still reluctantly standing, while medium and low-quality goods continued to decline. Old soybeans also softened with it. There were not many raw peanuts arriving, and the market was temporarily stable. There was a slight arrival of Qingdao oil in the oil market. The supply of soybean oil from the factory continued, falling by 1,000 yuan, forming a situation of fluctuating up and down, making it difficult to predict. The digestion of soybean cakes continued to be weak, and the price fell by 300 to 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour is Still Prohibited from Exporting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Food, requesting the cancellation of the ban. It is learned that the Municipal Government has received a reply from the Ministry of Food, stating that the food supply for Shanghai citizens has not yet emerged from the emergency period, and flour should still be prohibited from re-export. The Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal Social Bureau and the Bean and Rice Industry to notify that, except for those reported by the General Administration and the Ministry of Food, any other agency or individual is still not allowed to report and re-export flour.</p>
<h3>Three Banks and Two Bureaus Obey the Order Not to Participate in the Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 8th] The Fourth Joint Office held its 315th board meeting at 10:00 AM on August 8th. All directors attended. Minister Yu Hongjun served as the chairman. In addition to approving more than 20 important loans, Minister Yu reported that the Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Treasury, which is being prepared to be established, is an organization for commercial banks and money shops to pool their resources and mutually assist each other. The China Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau Postal Remittance Bureau, all national financial institutions, should not participate.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market is Quiet, Floral Cloth Sales are Lively</h3>
<p>The yarn market was still lifeless yesterday, and sales to customers were sluggish. Transactions were extremely light. The fluctuations of 20-count yarn were very strong. 42-count yarn decreased by about 20,000 to 30,000. Sales among peers were also lacking. With the hot weather, the opening was very late, and the closing was advanced. People's confidence was quiet, and the trend was still very depressed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraph rose by 16 to 23 pounds. The recent US dollar was 34.50, the new flower futures was 31.43, and the Mitlin spot was 35.30. Spot cotton trading in this port continued to be smooth. Shenxin Second and Tongyi, Xinsheng, Anda, Datong and other yarn factories all purchased, and the market price rose frequently by 1,000 to 2,000.</p>
<p>Sales of medium-grade grey cloth increased sharply. Because Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and other places have strong demand for raw colored cloth, dyeing factories and trading houses have rushed to search, so the situation is lively. Private factories such as Fugui, Dapeng, and China Southern have purchased particularly quickly. Recently, grey cloth has improved, fortunately, the Textile Construction Corporation is still supplying, and the market is still flat. However, Biji is still tired due to sufficient chips. At noon, Textile Construction Corporation sold fine cloth as usual, only 500 to 600 yuan higher. Biji did not move, and the rest were also similar to the last time.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, artificial silk suddenly rose sharply. 120-count Tianqiao bright spot goods opened at only 1.515 million yuan, and in a blink of an eye, it made 530,000 yuan. The transaction was very frequent among peers, and finally made 550,000 yuan to close. The opening price of Zhongfang was the same as the previous period, but 120-count bright spot goods had no goods to open. In the afternoon, people's confidence was even stronger, and finally made 590,000 yuan, which was 70,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 120-count miscellaneous bright spots had a lot of actual sales, and the price also followed, such as Jin Sanma first made 480,000 yuan in the morning, and then rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it made 560,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan better than the day before. 120-count semi-bright spot, 50,000 to 60,000 yuan higher, 150-count bright spot, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher, 75-count semi-bright spot rose by 90,000 yuan. Silk goods transactions were extremely rare, but Huayin raised the price to 2,000 yuan due to the high price of raw materials. Factory users had a few transactions in silk, and the price was shouted 50,000 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Four Recommendations to Save the Tea Industry from the Current Urgent Crisis</h3>
<p>The China Tea Industry Association, considering the current tea industry crisis imminent and urgently requiring the government to take effective measures to rescue it, drafted a summary of key points through various businesses in the same industry. They publicly elected representatives to go to the capital, Beijing, to request relief from the government. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Request the government to provide tea export subsidies: The Indian government, due to British tea prices being lower than cost, implemented tea export subsidies of up to nine pence per pound. The United States also implemented cotton export subsidies. Therefore, it is proposed to request the government to implement export subsidies.</p>
<p>(2) Request the government to continue tea barter trade: In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the government used tea to barter with the Soviet Union and airlifted it to the United States to support sales in North Africa, achieving considerable success. Now that tea exports have stagnated, it is imperative to resume barter trade with the Soviet Union. In addition, barter trade can be carried out based on the needs of various countries, such as French North Africa needing Chinese tea, and the French government could be asked to exchange it for Annamese rice.</p>
<p>(3) Request the government to use economic diplomacy to expand the Chinese tea market: An investigation reveals that the tariffs of some countries have unfavorable provisions for Chinese tea. For example, the United Kingdom restricts the import quantity of Chinese tea to 2.5 million pounds this year. The United States sets a very low price limit for Chinese tea. Furthermore, in French Morocco, the largest market for Chinese green tea, the French government has issued an order prohibiting the import of Chinese tea. It is proposed to request the government to negotiate with the relevant countries through diplomatic channels to eliminate the above-mentioned restrictions.</p>
<p>(4) Request the government to continue to provide tea loans and extend the principal repayment date of tea loans: This year, in order to support the tea industry in Southeast China, the government designated the Central Farmer's Bank to provide tea loans of 7 billion yuan, with a deadline of three months. Currently, it is difficult to expand exports temporarily. It is proposed to request the government to extend the principal repayment date. In addition, tea merchants feel that the interest burden is too heavy due to the lower profits from export trade this year. It is proposed to request the government to specifically approve a reduction in tea loan interest rates. Furthermore, the production of packaged tea still relies on the government's continued provision of refined processing loans. As for brick tea produced in Hunan and Hubei provinces, which amounts to more than 500,000 dan per year and is related to barter trade with the Soviet Union, it is also proposed to request prompt approval for loans.</p>
<h3>Increased Tobacco Leaf Production in Shandong</h3>
<p>This Year Could Reach 100,000 Pounds</p>
<p>It is reported that the tobacco leaf harvest in Shandong, Henan, and other places this year is estimated to reach 100,025,000 pounds, which is still less than the pre-war production, but it exceeds last year's production by more than two times.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Reserve Requirements No Longer a Problem, Rediscount Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Recently, the financial industry has been eagerly hoping that the Central Bank will promptly implement rediscounting. According to a person in charge of the bank: the issue of rediscounting is still under careful consideration because the bills in the Shanghai market are extremely complex, and it is not easy to distinguish between productive and non-productive uses. The purpose of rediscounting is to maintain legitimate productive enterprises. If it is transferred to speculative purposes after implementation, it will instead inflate credit and stimulate prices. However, the bank has already started handling re-pledging of export drafts, and manufacturers in various places can pledge re-export and export goods to the three banks and two residential associations. The silver and money industries currently have a joint reserve association, which is sufficient for turnover among peers. If the association's capabilities are still insufficient, the bank will naturally come forward to maintain it. Regarding the reduction of reserve requirements, the person in charge said: It is being discussed with the Ministry of Finance, and there is no problem with reducing reserve requirements. However, the exact amount of the reduction has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu on Vegetables and Pork: No Price Increases Allowed</h3>
<p>Recently, vegetable and pork prices have been rising without end. The municipal government specifically summoned the directors of the vegetable and fresh pork industries yesterday afternoon, including Zhang Shouren of the vegetable industry and Xin Xiaokang of the fresh pork industry. Mayor Wu personally met with them and first inquired about the reasons for the recent price increases in the two industries. He explained the municipal government's determination to thoroughly suppress prices. After the representatives presented detailed statements separately, Mayor Wu instructed the two industry associations to quickly and voluntarily lower prices and report on transportation and sales conditions at any time. If the associations encounter difficulties beyond their capabilities, he will do his best to assist them. If anyone in the industry engages in illegal behavior such as manipulating and monopolizing the market, they will be severely punished according to law. He hopes that those in charge of the associations will pay special attention and avoid regrets. The representatives of the respective industries all expressed that they would notify all members to comply.</p>
<h3>Jiao Tong Bank's Zhao Dihua Suggests Establishing a Rejuvenation Industrial Corporation to Regulate Long-Term Industrial Funds</h3>
<p>Zhao Dihua, General Manager of Jiao Tong Bank, advocated the organization of an investment company last year. Recently, China's industry has fallen into an increasingly depressed state. Zhao reiterated this proposal, and people in the financial community generally believe that such an organization is indispensable to solve the current industrial crisis. A "Rejuvenation China Industrial Finance Corporation" has been planned, with capital set at US$500 million and 5 billion yuan in national currency, to be subscribed by national banks, commercial banks, companies, insurance companies, etc. Its central business is for various industrial and mining enterprises to order foreign machinery and materials and may request the company to handle it on their behalf. The company will collect 10% to 30% of the deposit according to its credit rating and the nature of the machinery and materials purchased, issue letters of credit, or negotiate with foreign countries for installment payments or investments. When the machinery and materials ordered on behalf of the client arrive, the original client who requested the order should, in principle, pay in full or in installments according to the contract provisions. If they are unable to do so, the company may lend or advance funds depending on the situation. New industrial and mining enterprises that lack funds may request the company to raise funds on their behalf, or provide loans to them, or the company may negotiate investments or long-term loans with foreign companies on their behalf. For all guarantees made by the company to foreign industrial and mining companies and investments, and the financial sector, the company also plans to request the government to provide comprehensive and unconditional guarantees to foreign governments and people to enhance the company's credit abroad. With the establishment of credit abroad, if the environment is suitable, it may negotiate with foreign countries to issue foreign currency industrial bonds in foreign financial or securities markets. It is also known that the company, in order to meet the needs of various industrial and mining enterprises for domestic long-term funds, and taking into account the scarcity of domestic capital, may accept bonds issued by factories and mines according to the actual needs of factories and mines, or use factory land as collateral to provide long-term national currency funds. Zhao said that the United States had the organization of a "Reconstruction Finance Corporation" after the agricultural panic in 1930. After the end of this war, the United Kingdom also established an "Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation". At this critical juncture, we should catch up quickly and hope that colleagues in the financial sector will cooperate and organize quickly to save the industrial crisis.</p>
<h3>Reinsurance Business Gradually Developing: The Central Trust Bureau Allocates Huge Funds to Expand Efforts to Achieve the Goal of International Mutual Insurance</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] The underwriting of reinsurance business has become an extremely important position in today's insurance business. Yesterday, the reporter made a special trip to the Central Trust Bureau's Property Insurance Department to inquire about the underwriting of reinsurance business. It is reported that in the autumn of last year, when the war was still protracted, the prices of various properties were soaring day by day. Insurance companies, with their limited financial resources, were unable to underwrite properties with excessive prices. Even if they underwrote, they would all allocate a portion of the insured amount to foreign insurance companies for reinsurance. Therefore, the consumption of foreign exchange funds was quite large. In view of this, the Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to start the reinsurance business on September 4 last year, in addition to its original ordinary insurance business. The purpose is to enable private businesses to obtain actual benefits from this. At the same time, it can save the consumption of foreign exchange. The initial capital of the Bureau for handling reinsurance was 1 billion yuan. Later, due to the increasing development of the business, it was increased to 5 billion yuan in April of this year. From September of last year to the end of June of this year, the amount of reinsurance underwritten by various companies has reached more than 148 billion yuan. The scope of the above-mentioned turnover only refers to Shanghai and Chongqing. In order to facilitate insurance companies in other ports, the Bureau has started handling reinsurance business in its Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin branches from August 1st.</p>
<p>It was also discussed that the insurance business originally has international characteristics. According to the principles of insurance science, the more dispersed the insured amount, the lower the capital borne by each company and the smaller the risk. From the perspective of domestic reinsurance, the principle should be mutual benefit. However, according to the current situation in China, most of the reinsurance is distributed by domestic insurance companies to foreign companies, and few are distributed from foreign countries to domestic companies. The trend is purely one-sided. Therefore, it is hoped that the Bureau's handling of reinsurance business can play a leading role and unite the collective strength of domestic insurance companies to exchange reinsurance with foreign insurance companies in order to truly achieve the goal of international mutual benefit in the insurance business.</p>
<h3>The Textile Construction Company Says There is No Problem with Cotton Supply, but There is a Cotton Cloth Price Hike</h3>
<p>According to news from Washington recently, the price of American cotton will increase immediately, and some people advocate that cotton should be temporarily banned from export before prices are adjusted. A person in charge of the Textile Construction Company explained in detail that even if the price of American cotton increases immediately in the short term, it will have no impact on our country. The reasons are: (1) The price of cotton ordered by our government from the United States has already been stated and agreed upon in the order, and cannot be increased or decreased. (2) The domestic cotton production situation has greatly improved. Therefore, even if American cotton disappears, it will not cause any panic. At least this year, there will be no shortage of American cotton shipments to China. In addition, UNRRA also imports large quantities of cotton from time to time, and the price is similar to the fixed price.</p>
<p>There is no basis for the cotton cloth price hike</p>
<p>Regarding the recent sudden price hike in the cotton cloth market, he explained that this is because cotton cloth merchants heard this information and believed that cotton cloth exports would create a state of supply and demand imbalance, so they competed to purchase it. This trend may subside immediately, as cotton cloth from Zhongfang will be supplied continuously and will not be hit by the export policy. The spokesperson declined to make a positive statement on whether domestically produced cotton cloth can be exported in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Casual Notes from Mount Lu</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu Reporting by Air on the 2nd</p>
<p>Nine years ago, when Chairman Chiang was on Mount Lu, he entrusted two precious items, a jade photo and a longevity peach, commemorating his fiftieth birthday, to Wu, the former head of the Mount Lu American School for safekeeping. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, these two precious items were finally intact and were returned to Chairman Chiang and his wife yesterday. The jade bear was made of porcelain and Chairman Chiang was wearing a general's uniform. The longevity peach was also exactly the same and was placed in two high-footed glass cups, which were in a glass box that was about a foot long, eight inches high, and three inches wide.</p>
<p>Ambassador Stuart, on this trip to the mountain, fell ill due to overwork and climate changes. However, he had a strong sense of responsibility, knowing that hundreds of millions of Chinese people, and even people from various countries, were looking up to him, waiting for him to bring good news. This illness really worried him. The doctor insisted that he lie down all day. He became anxious and said to his secretary: "It's really annoying! Everyone is busy working, and I'm the only one lying in bed resting. How can I face others? How can I face myself? ...The doctor says I can't see guests or talk for three days. Can you please get me another doctor?"</p>
<p>Admiral Cooke, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, and his wife and children came to the mountain on August 1. Director-General Huang Renlin explained to Mrs. Cooke that the Haohan Slope (Hero's Slope) here is more than 900 steps high, so it is said that if someone can walk up it, they are a "hero". Mrs. Cooke said, "I would very much like to be a 'hero', but they won't give me the opportunity."</p>
<p>The postmen of Guling are quite dashing. On rainy days, you can see them holding an umbrella in one hand and a mailbag in the other, strolling slowly under the green shade, while singing loudly, making people feel a sense of "Tao Yuanming as a breeze."</p>
<p>The only basketball team in Guling is the "Weizhong Team", organized by the attendants of Chairman Chiang's residence. The team has been quite active recently and has won two out of two finals against the temporary basketball team of the summer camp. In order to reward all the team members, Chief Guard Yu Jishi is hosting a banquet tonight to cheer them on. The team members are not arrogant after winning and continue to work hard every day to maintain the "throne" forever.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Longhua Airport, Shanghai's Only Commercial Airport</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Yinhuai, Photographer Tingpeng, This Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>People are paying attention to the state of Longhua Airport, Shanghai's only commercial airport. The uneven runway, the dust flying everywhere, the tight and cramped airport, and the lack of hangars are huge obstacles to business expansion. The improvement work should be the urgent task at hand.</p>
<p>When a twin-engine passenger plane roared along the 5,000-foot runway, the wheels bumped forward on the uneven gravel road, dragging up a cloud of smoke-like dust. The Beijing saying "Three feet of soil without wind, mud filling the streets with rain" also applies here. The reporter recently inspected Longhua Airport and overlooked it from the air, resulting in the above impression.</p>
<p>More Than 50 Passenger and Training Aircraft</p>
<p>At 11:25 AM on the 2nd, the reporter and others took off on a China National Aviation Corporation C.46 twin-engine passenger plane. As soon as we left the ground, we saw the crowded airport. Looking down at the runway under the wing, on the left are the hangars of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, and on the right is the Dahua Aviation Corporation, which is being planned. Around the hangars, various sizes of passenger planes and training planes were parked, totaling about 50 or more.</p>
<p>The 5,000-foot runway, viewed from 500 feet in the air, is a yellowish-brown color. It runs roughly north-south, parallel to the Huangpu River. As the plane gradually climbed to a height of 650 feet, I felt smooth and stable in the plane. Even when there were some slight bumps, it felt like sitting on a Simmons bed, with an elastic and soft feeling. The reporter naturally thought of the jumping and bumping of the plane on the runway during takeoff, and couldn't help but marvel at it!</p>
<p>In the Early Days of Aviation, There Were Only Stinson Aircraft</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Longhua Airport was just an army parade ground for the Military Commission. In 1929, China National Aviation Corporation delineated a piece of flat land there, built a few houses, and bought a few small Stinson-style passenger planes. This was the beginning of China's civil aviation industry. At that time, they had no telecommunications equipment, no sky contact, and no meteorological stations. As for the runway, it was only 600 to 800 meters long. It is said that they chose the location on the Huangpu River to facilitate the takeoff and landing of seaplanes.</p>
<p>The Expansion of the Eurasian Aviation Company's Site</p>
<p>Two years later, the Sino-German joint venture Eurasian Aviation Corporation was established. The site was expanded a bit, and the runway was lengthened to 1,200 meters. At that time, the aircraft were, at most, a few DC-2 twin-engine passenger planes, each carrying only 16 passengers, which is clearly a small feat compared to the current situation where each engine carries 40 to 50 passengers.</p>
<p>On August 13, the flames of war spread to Shanghai, and Longhua Airport fell into the hands of the Japanese invaders. The airport itself underwent unprecedented expansion. Although no new hangars were added, the runway was extended to more than 5,000 meters, and the airport space, which could originally only accommodate more than a dozen aircraft, was expanded to accommodate more than a hundred heavy bombers. Several auxiliary runways running east-west were also added. Longhua Airport already had the prototype of an airport, at least it had the conditions to develop into a commercial airport.</p>
<p>Business Booms After the Two Companies' Return</p>
<p>After the victory, China National Aviation Corporation moved back to Shanghai, and Eurasian Aviation Corporation was reorganized successfully when China declared war on Germany. The Central Air Transport Corporation, which was wholly state-owned and under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, moved back to Shanghai for business before Christmas last year.</p>
<p>Both companies purchased many US military C-46 and C-47 surplus aircraft. At the same time, due to the government's active rehabilitation efforts, people flocked to Shanghai, and business presented an unprecedented boom.</p>
<p>Under the close cooperation of the two companies, there is also a take-off and landing control tower at the airport. Each company also has its own telecommunications station to communicate with the air or directly report to aviation stations in various places. The main routes have been expanded to six, with the farthest reaching Xi'an and Lanzhou. In the southwest, the routes extend to Kunming and may extend to Bangkok, Vietnam. The Hong Kong route may extend to the Philippines.</p>
<p>A Huge Obstacle Has Not Yet Been Overcome Satisfactorily</p>
<p>However, the rapidly growing civil aviation industry has always had one major obstacle that it has been unable to overcome. That is to say, Shanghai lacks a suitable airport.</p>
<p>Among the five airports in Shanghai, Jiangwan may be more suitable than Longhua, but Longhua is the civil airport designated by the Aviation Commission. In present-day China, where military aviation also needs to catch up quickly, commercial institutions seem unable to look at the vast site of Jiangwan Airport and the smooth and wide runway and vainly hope to get their hands on it. Although the two companies at Longhua Airport are doing their best to make partial improvements to provide a comfortable environment for passengers taking off or landing, this is irrelevant.</p>
<p>First, the unevenness of the runway has also increased the company's own burden of repairing aircraft wheels. Second, there is a lack of hangars, and 50 to 60 precious aircraft are left to be exposed to the rain and sun in the open air. The lifespan of the aircraft may be reduced as a result.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Financial Difficulties and Cannot Afford to Build an Airport</p>
<p>Improving the civil airport is of course the responsibility of the municipal authorities, but when the municipal government's administrative expenses are insufficient to cover its expenditures, it is clearly out of the question to build an airport. Since the municipal government has no funds, it seems that it does not intend to invest in this difficult matter for the time being (naturally, this is only temporary). Long ago, during the war, the municipal government charged airlines a percentage of the total revenue from passenger tickets as tax. Today, this can only be temporarily put aside.</p>
<p>Several Experts Have Been Hired to Study Improvement Plans</p>
<p>It is reported that the airline has hired several experts to study the improvement of Longhua Airport to make it a modern airport. It is said that the content of the plan is roughly divided into two points, and the details have not yet reached the time for publication. Of course, they are extremely willing to wait until the issue of the airport management rights is clarified before discussing the improvement plan, so that rights and obligations can have a more reasonable decision.</p>
<p>The issue of land ownership at Longhua Airport is also a complex matter, like tangled hair. In this area, due to the evolution of the past 20 years, it is not easy to determine who owns the property rights. Among them, in addition to the privately owned land that was acquired by the government, the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Transportation each have a part of it. Today, the municipal government is planning to collect information in order to sort out and resolve this outstanding issue.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Excretion in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Cui Liushan</p>
<p>The term "excretion" in physiology has a broad meaning, but this article will only refer to the excretion of feces.</p>
<p>The excretion of feces is unavoidable for everyone every day. If not properly handled after excretion, it can affect life, especially in densely populated large cities. The amount of feces produced is enormous, and whether it is handled properly or not is of utmost importance. Therefore, feces, similar to garbage disposal, is one of the important issues in municipal administration. Feces are disgusting and dangerous. Feces contain a large amount of organic matter. Once this organic matter decomposes, it produces foul gas. At temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees Celsius, one cubic meter of feces can generate 18 cubic meters of foul gas in 24 hours. Its composition is roughly: (1) 10 cubic meters of volatile fatty acids and hydrocarbons, (2) 6 cubic meters of carbon monoxide, (3) 2 cubic meters of ammonia. This gas can cause mental discomfort, vomiting, reduced appetite, or even direct poisoning. One cubic centimeter of feces contains 381 million microorganisms. One cubic centimeter of urine contains 200 million microorganisms. Not all of these microorganisms are harmful, but if the feces come from a sick body, they often contain a large number of pathogens. For example, the feces of patients with typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery are full of pathogens. These diseases often spread through feces. In addition, there are various parasites such as roundworms, hookworms, pinworms, whipworms, lung flukes, liver flukes, trichinella, and ginger flukes. Their eggs are scattered in excrement and urine, and are also transmitted through feces.</p>
<p>This alone is enough to show how disgusting and terrifying feces can be. Now let's calculate how much feces there is in the entire city of Shanghai. According to Pettenkofer, one person excretes 34 kilograms of feces and 400 kilograms of urine per year. Based on this, Shanghai's 3.4 million people produce 115,600 tons of feces and 1,360,000 tons of urine per year, totaling 1,475,600 tons, averaging 4,040 tons per day. According to the past French Concession's usage of manure carts, with each three carts roughly equaling one ton, Shanghai should transport 12,120 carts of feces per day. If such a large amount of waste is not handled properly, it can cause great distress, or even lead to great disasters.</p>
<p>Steps for Handling Feces</p>
<p>Handling feces can usually be divided into the following steps: one is temporary storage, two is collection and transportation, and three is utilization or destruction. Before discussing each item separately, there are two points that need to be explained.</p>
<p>First, the most ideal way to handle feces is to use flush toilets, which are built-in flushing devices. This type of device minimizes the time feces are exposed to the air after defecation. Dirt does not accumulate, odors are not emitted, and they are transported directly underground to the final disposal site. Even without the natural disinfection of septic tanks, there is absolutely no chance for pathogens to escape, so it is the most hygienic. However, the architecture in Shanghai is still very backward, and most houses do not have this type of device. It is estimated that only one-sixth of the city's feces are handled in this way. In places where sewage pipes are installed, many are damaged, causing fecal water to overflow. The responsibility for repairs is shirked between landlords and tenants, resulting in filth all over the ground, which becomes a problem for environmental hygiene.</p>
<p>Second, feces can be used as fertilizer because their chemical composition includes nitrogen, potassium, and phosphates, which can enrich the soil. Chinese agriculture is traditionally heavily reliant on feces. According to the former Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Entomology, the value of feces used nationwide in one year was 20 million yuan, which, according to the current currency value, is more than 80 billion yuan. So from another point of view, this thing is also a "treasure." The feces produced in Shanghai are still being sold by the cart and boat, with a considerable income. Farmers in the surrounding countryside use it as fertilizer, and it can be said that they cannot do without it. Under these circumstances, the storage of feces, the transportation of feces, and the period of feces utilization should be handled strictly in accordance with public health conditions.</p>
<p>Installation of Public Latrines</p>
<p>Now let's talk about storage first. The sanitary conditions for storage require, first, preventing flies from gathering and breeding as much as possible; second, minimizing the emission of odors. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to choose appropriate locations, arrange appropriate facilities, use appropriate containers, and the most important point is to clean frequently. As for the storage methods, the ones used in Shanghai today are nothing more than the following two types: chamber pots are mostly used privately, and pit latrines are mostly used publicly.</p>
<p>The installation of public latrines is certainly very important in such a large city. However, considering the urban area, Shanghai has only 225 public latrines, averaging one public latrine per 0.42 square kilometers. Considering the frequent movement of citizens and the lack of sanitary facilities in general households, this number is really not enough. In the past, the Bureau of Health decided to add 200 public latrines by selecting suitable locations. During Mayor Qian's tenure, recognizing the urgency of this facility, he allocated 100 million yuan for the construction of public latrines. If this plan is completed, there will be one public latrine per 0.22 square kilometers in the urban area. The addition of public latrines not only facilitates citizens' excretion, but is also necessary for maintaining cleanliness.</p>
<p>However, there are many problems with public latrines. If the location is not chosen well, the result may not only be unhelpful to hygiene, but also harmful to hygiene. Secondly, the construction of public latrines is a problem, and management is also a problem. In the urban area of Shanghai, there are currently 225 public latrines, of which 120 are set up by the municipal authorities. Most of them have flushing devices, and sanitary conditions are also taken into account in terms of location and construction, such as good designs for air circulation and wastewater discharge. But the situation is different for those set up privately. The purpose of private individuals setting up public latrines is to collect feces for profit. They do not pay attention to construction, nor do they pay attention to cleaning. Often, feces and urine are all over the ground, making it impossible to set foot in them. The chamber pots are full of filth, and in the summer, flies gather and maggots spread. They are not only disgusting and unbearable, but also extremely dangerous. These toilets must be banned, or at least ordered to be improved, to avoid being a source of disaster.</p>
<p>I think that the establishment of public latrines by private individuals should be encouraged in principle, because there are not enough public latrines now, and the government cannot add so many in a short time. However, the selection of locations, the design of buildings, etc. must be strictly reviewed by the government, and at the same time, attention should be paid to management in the same way as public pit latrines.</p>
<p>Managing public latrines requires diligent cleaning and attention to killing maggots and flies. In addition, there is also a business of selling toilet paper in Shanghai's public latrines. Because the capital is small and the profit is high, many people compete to contract for it. Others believe that those who operate this business take too high a profit and advocate restricting or abolishing it. I personally think that abolishing it is the best; if it cannot be abolished for the time being, its price should also be limited, so that things that are intended for convenience do not end up having the drawback of exploitation.</p>
<p>The Problem of Feces Collection and Transportation</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of transportation, the same attention should be paid as in storage; especially the transportation vehicles such as carts and ships should be tightly sealed to prevent feces from being arbitrarily exposed. Regarding the management of collection and transportation, the feces in the urban area of Shanghai, until the collapse of the puppet government last year, have always been contracted by merchants. The government collected "cleaning fees" monthly according to the contract. The contracted merchants sent dung collectors to pull carts to collect feces from each household, transport them to the dung wharf, sell them to dung transport merchants, and then the merchants distributed them to nearby areas.</p>
<p>The contracting of feces transportation, according to the situation at the time of the collapse of the puppet government, was divided into several regions: Pudong, Wusong, and Xu Cao each formed one region, and the old concession, Zhabei (including Jiangwan), Nanshi, and Hu Xi (excluding Xu Cao) formed one region. The latter region had the widest working area and the largest scope of business, accounting for more than 80% of the total amount cleared daily. This region averages 6,500 carts of feces per day, with each cart weighing about 0.32 tons, totaling 2,080 tons. Its contract price in September last year was 101,786,000 yuan in puppet currency, equivalent to 508,930 yuan in legal currency. All the dung collectors were paid by the contractors in the form of profit sharing; the tools they used (dung carts), some were owned by the contractors themselves, and some were placed by the government and lent to the contractors for use. In the past, the Public Concession authorities placed a large number of dung carts, of which more than 900 remain to this day. Contractors own about 1,200 carts, totaling about 2,000 carts.</p>
<p>Most of the dung carts are damaged. Therefore, when pushing and pulling them through the city, feces often drip and splash on the road. In the past, the Bureau of Health actively supervised the repairs, but they could not be completely repaired, mostly because the cart bodies were too old and new carts had to be added to solve the problem. This is problem one.</p>
<p>Dung collectors originally had a fixed time for transporting feces. Later, due to lax management, or because dung dumping started later, or because there was a large amount of feces and few dung carts, the result was that even at noon, dung carts were still seen rolling through the downtown area. In the past, the Bureau of Health stipulated that the collection of feces on major streets must be completed before 8 o'clock, and other more remote areas were limited to collecting carts before 10 o'clock. But in fact, some dung collectors still cannot do it according to the regulations. This is problem two.</p>
<p>Dung collectors charge households a tip every month for dumping feces. During the New Year and holidays, there are also so-called bonuses, which have become ingrained and almost unbreakable. These tips increase with the increase in prices. During the New Year and holidays, they often extort huge amounts, and households cannot bear the demands, so there are many complaints. This kind of malpractice certainly needs to be reformed, but reform cannot be done with just one piece of paper or one order. There must be a comprehensive plan. This is problem three.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, dumping feces has become a special occupation. Dung collectors are linked together to form a gang, and each person occupies a traditional section, which cannot be violated by others. For example, if A dumps feces on this street, A can pass it on to his children or sell it to others, but no one else is allowed to send another person to share the work. If the work is heavy and assistants are needed, he will hire them himself; if others rashly join, not only will the original occupant of that section not allow it, but the entire industry will not recognize it. Colleagues echo each other, and often threaten the general residents and the contractors who manage the business with strikes and transport strikes. This is problem four.</p>
<p>Some of these problems are related to funding and personnel, and most are related to the entire system. I have always been skeptical of the contracting system. After assuming responsibility for environmental sanitation work in Shanghai, I discovered many malpractices of this system from all aspects. Finally, I came to the conclusion that if we want to do a good job in handling feces in Shanghai, we must start by reforming the contractor system. (Continued on page nine)</p>

<h3>Two Things About Road Repair</h3>
<p>Recently, this newspaper received two letters from readers, both related to road construction. We immediately forwarded the letters to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for inquiry. We have now received a reply; both letters are recorded as follows;</p>
<p>Careless Repair of Hu-Min Road Editor: The section of Hu-Min Highway from Caohejing to Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School was repaired by the Allied forces after the victory, because the school housed a concentration camp for British and American expatriates, and the Allied forces sent a grader to repair it for the convenience of visiting relatives and friends. The work took about 20 days, and the road surface was smooth, like an asphalt road. People passing by were amazed at the greatness of mechanical power. However, the road surface is now damaged again. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent a grader to repair it, but the work only lasted for two or three days, and then it was completed, but the road surface is still uneven and full of gravel. People passing by all say: The same machinery is used to repair the road, but the results are different. The Chinese will never do it well. (Shi Fan)</p>
<p>Demolition of Road Built with Donated Funds Editor: The sidewalk at the entrance of our alley is dilapidated after years of disrepair. It is uneven, and rainwater accumulates after rain. After being exposed to sunlight, the smell is foul. Recently, enthusiastic people initiated donations to build the road, and everyone agreed, so they hired workers to repair it. Unexpectedly, as soon as the work was completed, several workers appeared, intending to demolish it by hand. At that time, residents asked why they were demolishing it, and they replied that you had not obtained permission from the Bureau of Public Works and could not build it without authorization. A few days later, the demolition workers came with official documents and police, and were led by a senior official. After the residents pleaded, they agreed to postpone the execution, and immediately requested the Bureau of Public Works for approval, so that it would not have to be demolished. The next day, the demolition workers came again, claiming that the order issued by the bureau could not be withdrawn and had to be executed, so they completely destroyed the road surface and left. May I ask why is this so? (A resident of Lane 4689, Weishou Road)</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>(1) After investigation, Caohejing to Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School is a section of the Hu-Min Highway. The road has not yet been assigned to the jurisdiction of this city, and this bureau has never sent workers to repair it. Mr. Tong's statement that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works sent a grader to repair it must be a misunderstanding. (2) After investigation, the interim measures for project management by this bureau have long been approved and promulgated. According to Article 2 of the measures, if public roads and sidewalks in public alleys are damaged, it should be reported to this bureau for restoration. If the damage is caused by various private facilities, the restoration project should also be applied for by this bureau and not handled independently. The residents of Lane 4689, Changshou Road, did not follow the regulations and report the application to this bureau, and repaired it on their own. After this bureau noticed, the 13th engineering section sent personnel to notify them to complete the formalities, but they delayed in doing so. After all, whether the sidewalk was damaged due to years of disrepair, it is no longer possible to prove afterwards, and the engineering standards of private construction are difficult to match with the regulations of this bureau. The engineering section sent workers to demolish it according to the provisions of Article 8 of the measures, and it was handled in accordance with the regulations. I hope that citizens will pay attention to it in the future to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Talent Selection in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's July 18th airmail dispatch, special correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The personnel policy of Taiwan Province is to support compatriots so that they can take responsibility for managing the administration of Taiwan Province. The authorities are doing this, but some people still believe that officials at the director level have not been appointed from among the Taiwanese, and are dissatisfied with the authorities. In fact, the authorities have their own difficulties, because the Taiwanese are not yet able to complete the task.</p>
<p>Chief Chen specifically raised this issue at a certain gathering, saying:</p>
<p>"We must all pay attention to building first-class administrative talents for Taiwan's construction. In Taiwan, such excellent talents can naturally be discovered as long as we sincerely seek them. Those who are highly intelligent, broad-minded and ambitious should be given opportunities to serve as deputy directors. If the director goes to Beijing, they can also go together, so that they can not only understand the actual situation in the province, but also understand the national political situation. In a few years, the first-class talents of this province can be cultivated successfully." He continued, "If we do not sincerely and earnestly strive to support them, the people of this province will never be able to become first-class officials. If we were from this province, we would also feel dissatisfied."</p>
<p>For general institutions, he strongly advocated using more technical personnel and fewer administrative personnel. He said, "If a large number of ordinary civil servants are invited to Taiwan again, the finances cannot bear this heavy pressure!"</p>
<h3>Understanding Our Compatriots of the Highlands</h3>
<p>The compatriots of the highlands scattered within Taiwan Province were strictly managed by the Japanese and given rations of daily necessities before the victory. After the victory, they regained their freedom and enjoyed human rights. However, this freedom and right is insignificant to the 130,000 indigenous people who have not received modern education and are located in remote mountainous corners. They are grateful for the small favors of the Japanese, but never thought of being grateful for being given freedom and equality.</p>
<p>In the past six months, this ethnic group has shown signs of instability in some places. The highland ethnic groups in the Qishan District of Kaohsiung County, due to misunderstandings about the political orders of Kaohsiung, have moved their villages to Taitung and Taichung. Although no facts have been seen in other places, they are brewing dissatisfaction with the government's indifference. Therefore, in addition to the Civil Affairs Department trying to issue more than 21,000 pieces of woven fabrics and the relief branch issuing relief supplies, the authorities have decided to set up grocery stores in the mountainous areas and encourage administrative educators who go to the highlands by raising their salaries by 20% to 50%. Chief Chen said, "It is not feasible to run cooperatives in the highlands. It is still up to the Bureau of Trade to plan to open grocery stores and have highland compatriots be the managers. Don't make too much money, especially avoid exploitation." He quoted former Governor-General Ando Rikichi's words, "The highland ethnic groups are brave, active, and honorable in the South Pacific War. They are a good ethnic group, but unfortunately the Japanese did not know them," and said, "The Japanese regretted not knowing them, and now we cannot make the same mistake!"</p>
<h3>Finances in Difficulty</h3>
<p>In the past, the expenditures of various counties and cities in Taiwan Province reached 1.3 billion yuan, while the income was only 200 million yuan. The Finance Department has balanced this large difference by allocating tax sources on the one hand, changing taxation from quantity to value, and reducing expenditures on the other hand. However, difficulties are still occurring in practice. The Japanese accounting year ends in March and begins in April. April, May, and June are the consolidation periods, and no taxes are collected. The previous income is adjusted, which is not enough to cover expenditures. The collection of land tax in kind will begin in August, and taxes account for 19% of the province's total income, about 300 million yuan. After consolidation, the income has increased two or three times, but it is still limited, and 80% depends on public enterprises. At present, this has become a problem. The railway loses 1 million yuan every day, and even after the increase in postal and telecommunications prices, the losses are still very large. Therefore, although it is currently a period of shortage, the future is not optimistic. Taiwan has not seen inflation because there are 600 million yuan of frozen Japanese funds and 1.34 billion yuan in the Bank of Taiwan that can be used. All counties and cities are short of money and cannot issue salaries. The Bank of Taiwan has no way to borrow money, so it can only order each unit to think of more ways on their own.</p>
<p>Chief Chen said, "Now it seems like a rebellious thing to raise the prices of public enterprises. This kind of thinking must be eradicated."</p>
<h3>Teacher Performance Evaluation Standards</h3>
<p>Not long ago, the Department of Civil Affairs used cracking down on unlicensed rickshaws, children smoking, and riding public cars to school as one of the important performance assessments for police officers. Recently, there are new performance evaluation standards for education.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, a common phenomenon is occurring at all levels, that is, the discord between the Taiwanese and the mainlanders. Taiwanese and mainland primary school students often fight with each other, planting seeds of mutual resentment in their weak hearts.</p>
<p>Chief Chen said: Children fighting is precisely the experimental period for teachers' opportunity education, and they can take this opportunity to educate them. In the future, the performance of primary school principals or teachers can be based on the number of times primary school students fight, in order to determine their merits!"</p>
<p>This is a special situation in a special Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Banning Trivial Tabloids</h3>
<p>There are a total of 48 registered newspapers and magazines in Taiwan. Except for the Taiwan Peace Daily splitting its edition and the aviation editions of the Ta Kung Pao and the Central Daily News not being registered, other publications are registered, about 20 or 30 kinds.</p>
<p>Chief Chen believes that the publication of trivial newspapers should be restricted. If small newspapers have no capital and no equipment, and just want to use the newspaper to extort money, they can be prohibited from publishing. The existing newspapers do not have to be ordered to stop publishing immediately, but the future ones can be restricted in terms of capital and talent. He said, "Whatever we do, we must have a policy, and laws and regulations should be used flexibly according to the policy, and should not be overly rigid." At the same time, he verbally issued an order:</p>
<p>"From now on, government agencies are not allowed to place advertisements in trivial tabloids!"</p>
<h3>The Outline of Hunan Politics</h3>
<p>— Our newspaper's first day Changsha dispatch, special correspondent Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to review provincial politics, has stipulated that this year's administrative meetings will be held in three districts: Changsha, Hengshan, and Yuanling. The Changsha District Administrative Meeting opened on July 22nd and closed on July 28th, lasting seven days. A total of 22 counties participated in the meeting. Although it is only one-third of Hunan Province, it is not difficult to see the outline of Hunan's current provincial politics in this meeting.</p>
<h3>Brigandage by Stragglers and Deserters</h3>
<p>Since the major battles in Hunan, coupled with the severe disasters, the provincial government chairman has been replaced repeatedly in the past two years. It must be admitted that this has affected administrative efficiency, resulting in many important policies not being implemented. In particular, since Chairman Wang took office and announced the slogan "Disaster Relief First," commissioners and county magistrates have been focusing all their efforts on "disaster relief."</p>
<p>After more than half a year of "disaster" relief, the autumn harvest is showing great promise. From the perspective of the provincial government, the disaster situation is expected to be overcome, and the political focus should naturally shift. Therefore, Chairman Wang announced in the administrative meeting that the province's policy should be changed from "Disaster Relief First" to "Public Security First." This shift in political direction is aimed at the reality of the situation. Since the provincial chairman has put forward the slogan "Public Security First," there are certainly some problems with local public security. In the past year, the National Revolutionary Army stationed in Hunan has been transferred elsewhere, leaving the defenses empty. A group of stragglers and deserters left over from the war have taken the opportunity to rise up, and incidents of brigandage have occurred frequently. Moreover, the mountainous areas of western Hunan, which have always been infested with bandits, have become even more rampant. As a result of the activities of treacherous bandits, in Changsha County alone, 57 treacherous bandits have been arrested since the end of the war, and 4,100 have surrendered themselves. There are still many who have not surrendered. In other places, such as Pingjiang, Liuyang, Linxiang, and Xiangtan, there is a general atmosphere of social unrest and rampant banditry. If this situation is allowed to continue, Hunan will follow up a major disaster with major chaos, and will truly be headed for total collapse. Chairman Wang also pointed out at the meeting the method of dividing areas for responsible suppression: (1) If there are bandits within a county, the county magistrate is responsible for suppressing them; (2) If there are bandits at the junction of two counties, the commissioner is responsible for suppressing them; (3) If there are bandits at the border of two administrative regions, the police department is responsible for suppressing them. He also believes that the fundamental solution is still to "suppress bandits politically" and puts forward four basic requirements for the work of counties, townships, and towns in the future: (1) Stabilize local order, (2) Eliminate illegal levies, (3) Repair county and township roads, and (4) Reorganize warehouses and dams.</p>
<h3>Too Few Personnel, Insufficient Efficiency</h3>
<p>This was the major topic of the Changsha administrative meeting. However, what was the reaction of the county magistrates after this issue was raised? In general, there were three requests: one, personnel; two, power; and three, money. Originally, the county government was small, but it had the greatest responsibility and the most work to do. However, the lack of personnel affected administrative efficiency. However, the "Measures for Adjusting the Political Structure of Counties and Townships in Hunan Province," passed by the fifth meeting of the Provincial Government this year, greatly reduced the number of personnel in each county. Therefore, the county magistrates raised objections at the meeting and requested an increase. However, Chairman Wang's reply was that the adjustment measures were based on actual needs and standards. He cited Sichuan as an example, where first-class counties had only 68 people, while first-class counties in Hunan had as many as 78. He believed that the number of people was sufficient, and the problem was whether they were capable enough. Therefore, the most important thing is to improve the quality of personnel, and the appointment of township and town heads should be raised to a higher level to promote local autonomy and improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<h3>Lively Discussion on the Issue of Power</h3>
<p>The issue of "power" is indeed worthy of attention. Taking the issue of suppressing bandits raised by the provincial government as an example, the county magistrates deeply felt that they were in a dilemma. Prohibiting township and town offices from using armed guards was originally the right thing to do because those armed guards only oppress the people, and are the most hated and resented thing by the people. However, once there are bandits, without guns and soldiers, are the county magistrates and county government officials supposed to fight them with their bare hands? Although the county has a police bureau and the township has a police station, can the police station be commanded by the township office, because the police station is outside the township and town establishment?</p>
<p>The issue of the subordination of the county and municipal grain bureaus and tax collection offices is also worthy of attention. After the revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system, county-level finances have been better managed, but the tax collection agencies are not under the command and supervision of the county government, which naturally leads to restrictions. Moreover, in the past, county grain bureau chiefs often absconded after losing money, leaving the county magistrates with no one to complain to. Moreover, since the county is an autonomous unit, it is reasonable for taxes to be autonomous. After a lively discussion on this issue, it was decided to suggest that the central government merge the land tax and tax collection into a tax collection office, subordinate to the county government, and implemented from January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. The personnel will be appointed by the Department of Finance. This will increase the tax revenue of both the province and the county, and the county's ability to operate may be strengthened as a result.</p>
<h3>Financial Shortages Make It Difficult to Cope</h3>
<p>The issue of "money" is an issue that all county magistrates find difficult. As mentioned above, the county magistrate bears the greatest responsibility and should do the most. However, without money, nothing can be done. Although the financial difficulties at the county level have been resolved with the implementation of the revised financial revenue and expenditure system, the provincial level is still difficult. The temporary relief measures to fill the gap caused by the suspension of national tax allocations are the most important thing for the county level. From January to June of this year, Hunan received 1.65 billion yuan in national tax allocations, which was still felt to be lacking after being distributed to various counties. The Department of Finance drafted three temporary relief measures: (1) Counties that have already implemented grain storage and price stabilization can borrow the funds from grain storage and price stabilization; (2) Counties that have not implemented grain storage and price stabilization can borrow grain; (3) Counties that have neither grain to borrow nor grain storage funds to borrow can negotiate with the provincial bank to instruct its branches to provide short-term overdrafts. However, after eight years of war in Hunan, there are very few counties with grain storage, and it is doubtful whether the strength of the provincial bank is sufficient to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3>Political Integrity Depends on the County Level</h3>
<p>The clarity and progress of politics are all entrusted to the county level, and the completion of local autonomy is the central focus of the central government's promotion for the past ten years. However, the inherent contradictions have been generally ignored. Liu Qianjun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, pointed out the objective contradictions in implementing government orders and the contradictions within the government itself. He said that the people love to be scattered and free, while the government wants to organize and train them. The people want to be selfish and evade responsibility, while the government wants to conscript labor, conscript workers, and collect taxes. These are objective contradictions. The government wants to train the people to exercise their four powers, but is also worried that the people's abilities are not clear and interferes. In fact, it wants to mobilize the power of the people to complete construction, but is afraid of harming wealth and strength. It organizes the masses, but is afraid that the power of the mass organizations will oppose it. These are the contradictions within the government itself.</p>
<p>Since the existing contradictions are like this, and the "power," "money," and "personnel" of the county government have never been reasonably resolved, how can it do anything? This Changsha regional administrative meeting reached a preliminary solution to the above three matters, and perhaps Hunan politics can get on the right track in the future.</p>
<h3>The Sewage Problem in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Continued from the eighth page.</p>
<p>The Malpractices of the Contracting System</p>
<p>For the administrative authorities, the contracting system has the advantage of saving trouble and ensuring a fixed amount of income on time. However, it also has many drawbacks. I believe that the lack of progress in this work is mostly due to the influence of this system.</p>
<p>The establishment and maintenance of this system is probably due to the fact that the responsible authorities dislike filth and fear trouble. This already fundamentally demonstrates an undesirable laziness. I often say that our work in sanitation is simply to turn filth into cleanliness and weakness into health. To deal with filth, we must face it squarely and never adopt an attitude of avoidance.</p>
<p>Moreover, feces are something that everyone dislikes. They would rather pay a few coins to get rid of it. On the other hand, some people regard it as a "treasure" and buy it according to its current value. Contractors exploit this contradiction to make huge profits. If the government authorities could not rely on middlemen, then this profit could be obtained by the government.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I would like to present a fact: Many people regard contracting feces as a good business and try every means to obtain the position of contractor. Many people believe that being a feces contractor under the health bureau can immediately become a millionaire. Is this calculation accurate? According to the past situation, it can be said to be accurate. Initially, the concession authorities only wanted the feces to be removed, so the price was extremely low. Later, this attitude did not change, and the price of feces contracts was never carefully calculated. During the war, the currency fluctuated violently, and prices rose. The price of feces also rose, but the "cleanliness fee" paid by the contractors was fixed in the contract and did not increase with time. With these two reasons, wouldn't it be possible to make a fortune by contracting feces? Precisely because it was easy to make a fortune, some people used their power to achieve the purpose of contracting. In the past, everyone knew that the "Feces King" became a rich man by contracting feces, and everyone knew that the "Feces King" obtained the right to contract feces by relying on special powers.</p>
<p>I remember that last year, after the Health Bureau took over the various businesses of the puppet government, it was subjected to threats and inducements from various parties for the sake of contracting feces. This made the person in charge at the time pay more attention to this issue and conduct special research on it. The research confirmed that the most fair and reasonable way was to have the government manage it itself. Therefore, the case of taking it back for municipal management was passed at the municipal council meeting on March 8. But even at this time, some people opposed the suggestion of municipal management on the grounds that the government should not manage filthy matters. At that time, Director Yu forcefully corrected this concept, pointing out that the task of public health is to eliminate filth, and the more filthy the place, the more the efforts of the health authorities are needed. This is actually not only Director Yu's belief, but everyone who understands public health should think this way.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, if the "Feces King" makes a fortune, it means that the government suffers a loss. In order to increase profits, contractors inevitably raise the price of feces for farmers or engage in hoarding. The management of feces carriers is poor, and there is a lot of leakage of feces, and it often happens that it is poured into sewers. This is a loss. Therefore, speaking of "economic utilization," the contracting system is also undesirable.</p>
<p>Government Management is Better Than Commercial Management</p>
<p>Abolishing the contracting system means that the government directly manages it. Government direct management can solve the above problems more easily than inviting merchants to contract. For example, regarding tools, contractors only seek temporary profits and do not plan for the long term, so they are naturally unwilling to spend more money. If the government manages it itself, a considerable amount can be allocated from the profits to organize and add to it at any time. Regarding the management of laborers, if the administrative power can be thoroughly implemented to the lower levels, and all isolation and concealment are eliminated, then all kinds of bad habits can be gradually broken, and a reasonable collection and transportation system can be gradually established. This kind of effort to remove the old and establish the new can never be expected from merchants who only seek profit. Only the government can establish a direction, plan comprehensively, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and implement it step by step, and then it can be done. It was said above that feces carriers are linked together and are difficult to deal with. To be honest, we must take into account their living requirements for these laborers. However, many unreasonable aspects of their habits must be reformed one by one with reasonable means. For example, in the past, the Health Bureau paid great attention to the issue of limiting collection and transportation time and urged it in many ways. As a result, it was found that this issue was related to the number of tools, the allocation of land, and the number of feces carriers. There are too many unreasonable things in this, but in order to take care of the facts, we have to use reasonable methods to implement the solution. And to achieve the purpose of solving the problem, we believe that it is impossible to do it without government power and only by seeking it from contractors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of finance, the government's revenue from government management must be far better than from commercial management. Because in theory, government management can eliminate the enrichment of merchants and take the profits of merchants for public use. As a matter of fact, the Health Bureau took over the Yongda Company at the end of last year. From November, it changed the night soil business originally operated by Yongda to a joint government-business operation. Calculating its income: in October, Yongda paid a "cleanliness fee" of 508,950 yuan. In November, the first month of the joint government-business operation, the revenue increased to 9,734,330 yuan. From April of this year, the government implemented self-management, and the income increased even more. By early June, the daily income reached more than 11 million yuan. At that time, the Health Bureau planned to use the income from this cleaning business to add various urgent tools to gradually improve this business.</p>
<p>Some people say that government-run businesses are not run well. This is a dogmatic assertion, a prejudice. I don't need to argue much about this. Just look at the facts. And I believe that as long as we believe in the effectiveness of the government, believe that politics has hope of improvement, and is on the way to improvement, then this view cannot stand.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a serious issue that few people in public health pay attention to, which is the timing of the use of feces. In our country, both in the past and now, farmers are allowed to transport fresh feces to the countryside for direct use as fertilizer. I have never seen such fresh feces being used after a reasonable period of time. Therefore, diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and parasites are constantly circulating and spreading. This is such a dangerous and serious issue. This problem is not easy to solve, but to solve it, only the method of government self-management can be taken.</p>
<p>Eliminate All Long-Standing Malpractices</p>
<p>From the above, we can see the seriousness of the nature of the feces problem and the complexity of the content of the Shanghai feces treatment problem. I advocate that the government should manage the feces business itself to replace the contracting system. Now that the government has managed it itself, I advocate continuing to manage it actively. Under the direct management of the government, many long-standing malpractices in the past can be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>We do not hope that the municipal authorities will always be bothered by the collection and transportation of feces. We hope that the city will progress. The direction of this progress, in terms of feces treatment, is to gradually make everyone use flush toilets, that is, the buildings are equipped with flushing devices so that all feces can be directly transported underground to the final treatment place. In this way, not only is there no need to waste labor on collection and transportation, but in terms of hygiene, the danger of spreading bacteria can be avoided.</p>
<p>Now it is rumored that the municipal health authorities are going to transfer the work of feces treatment, which is absolutely related to public health, to agencies outside the health bureau. Colleagues in the health field are all worried about the health of the citizens of this city after hearing this. I hope that the people in charge of health in this city and the authorities responsible for municipal administration will discuss it more beforehand. You must know that the hygiene knowledge of us Chinese people is not as deeply understood as that of every foreigner, and all the hygiene facilities are not as complete as those of foreigners. If the cleaning work of this kind that absolutely belongs to the public health department is transferred to an organization outside the health agency, whether the health knowledge of the personnel at all levels who are engaged in this work is qualified, and whether everything can be properly arranged, in other words, whether the danger of improper handling can be avoided and the health of the citizens can be affected, this point should be given deep consideration!</p>

<h3>Replies to Readers: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Chuan Ping asks: I am 27 years old, and I am still healthy. My hand bones were easily dislocated when I was young, but they could be realigned by shaking them. When I was a teenager, my left shoulder bone was occasionally dislocated when I used my hand to lift heavy objects. But it healed on its own. However, since last autumn, when I lift my left hand, I feel a "point" of pain in my shoulder joint, as if tendons and bones are rubbing against each other. If I lift it again, it does not hurt. Turning my arm is also the same. This summer, the soreness has slightly increased. If I lie on my back, bend my elbow, and shake my arm, my left shoulder bone makes a "crackling" sound and feels sore. The condition is even worse when the weather is cloudy and rainy. But I can still lift and hold heavy objects with my hand. It does not hurt when I am sleeping. I dare to ask: (1) What is the name of this disease? Will it get worse? Is it rheumatism? (2) How can it be treated? Are there any oral tablets or injections in Western medicine? Are there any in Chinese medicine? Is the anti-rheumatism wine on the market effective? (3) Can I seek treatment from a Chinese medicine traumatologist? Can this disease be cured completely? (4) Is the light, sticky nasal mucus in my left nostril sometimes related to this?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: 1, 2, 3, it is probably habitual dislocation. You need to see an orthopedic doctor for diagnosis and treatment. 4, it is not related. (2) Wei Ziwen, a refugee from Gaoyou, asks: Respectfully to the medical consultant of Shen Bao: Last summer, I recovered from malaria, and then I fled to Jiangnan. Because my body was weak after the illness and I could not rest, I soon suffered from inguinal hernia. My right testicle was swollen. At first, I did not feel pain. Later, when I walked further or faster, my testicle became pointed and hard, and there was a faint pain. I had to rest to recover, but it was still larger than my left testicle. Recently, even when using a cloth bag, it still feels dull pain when sitting or lying down. I have used warm medicines such as white chuanhui incense to apply it, but it has been ineffective. I have always admired your newspaper for benefiting the people. I respectfully write to ask for the method of treatment. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: You need to undergo inguinal hernia radical surgery. (3) Qi Ziji asks: (1) Several years ago, a bean-sized lump suddenly appeared in my neck. It cannot be moved by pushing it. I was afraid that it would become scrofula, so I went to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. But to this day, if my head is exercised violently, I feel pain from time to time. I don't know what disease it is? (2) How can I treat my nervous breakdown, which leads to weak memory, and I often feel headaches and get angry easily? (3) What are the symptoms of early lung disease? (4) What is the reason for being flustered when doing things?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor of Medicine, Tang Ren]: (1) It may be swollen lymph nodes. (2) Take more phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin B preparations. (3) The general symptoms of early pulmonary tuberculosis are cough, night sweats. (4) Neurasthenia.</p>

<h3>How to Prevent and Treat Athlete's Foot?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>New Theories on the Prevention and Treatment of Athlete's Foot</p>
<p>The pathogen of athlete's foot is the tinea fungus. Therefore, whether for prevention or treatment, one must focus on eradicating the tinea fungus.</p>
<p>Tinea fungus is a very common microorganism. Even feet and socks that do not have athlete's foot often contain it. Patients with athlete's foot naturally have a particularly large number of tinea fungi when the disease is active, and even when the disease is not active, the fungus still exists. The breeding of this fungus requires high temperatures and humidity. Therefore, once summer arrives, the temperature and humidity meet the conditions for tinea fungus breeding, and the fungi lurking on the feet and in the socks become very active, easily invading the skin of the feet and causing illness. Hong Kong is hot and humid, so athlete's foot is particularly prevalent there. The disease name "Hong Kong foot" comes from this.</p>
<p>To prevent and treat athlete's foot, it is necessary to eradicate the tinea fungus, because it not only lives on the surface of the skin of the foot, but also invades the inside of the skin when the disease occurs. In addition to the skin, there are naturally many tinea fungi inside the shoes and socks. Therefore, we have two targets: the feet and the shoes and socks.</p>
<p>Shoe and Sock Disinfection</p>
<p>Patients with athlete's foot often have recurrences every summer. If you want to prevent recurrence, you must thoroughly disinfect your used shoes and socks to eradicate the residual fungus.</p>
<p>Cloth shoes and machine-made shoes can be washed and then boiled in water for disinfection. Disinfecting leather shoes is more troublesome and can be done as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Thoroughly wash the inside of the shoe with water and soap;</p>
<p>2.  Thoroughly dry it with a dry cloth;</p>
<p>3.  Spread a thin layer of absorbent cotton evenly inside the shoe;</p>
<p>4.  Purchase a small amount of formaldehyde solution (Formalin) from the pharmacy, dilute it ten times with water. When using, take the diluted liquid and pour it onto the cotton in the shoe, about one teaspoon per shoe (about four cc);</p>
<p>5.  Place the medicated shoes in a paper box, close the lid tightly, and then wrap the outside with paper to reduce air leakage; disinfect in this way for six hours;</p>
<p>6.  Remove the shoes and discard the thin layer of cotton inside. Place the shoes in a ventilated place to air out for twenty-four hours;</p>
<p>7.  Apply shoe polish and then use.</p>
<p>Foot Hygiene</p>
<p>Shoe and sock disinfection must be coordinated with foot disinfection, otherwise, wearing disinfected shoes and socks on undisinfected feet, or putting fungus-free feet into undisinfected shoes and socks, will be the same as not disinfecting at all.</p>
<p>After the athlete's foot symptoms have been cured, thoroughly wash the feet with soap and hot water, dry them, and then lightly rub the entire foot with boric acid talcum powder (a mixture of 10 parts boric acid powder and 90 parts talcum powder), especially between the toes and on the soles of the feet. After rubbing, put on disinfected shoes and socks.</p>
<p>Every time summer is approaching, wash your feet every night, and after washing, use powder as described above. Apply powder again before putting on shoes in the morning.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated replacing boric acid powder with sodium propionate. Sodium propionate (Sodium Propionate) one part, mixed with ninety-nine parts of talcum powder. Sodium propionate is a recently discovered drug for killing tinea fungus, and its efficacy is very strong. It is also used for the treatment of athlete's foot.</p>
<p>Bleach solution was once widely used as a foot bath ten years ago, and it has the effect of killing tinea fungus. Public swimming pools and school bathrooms mostly use this type of foot bath equipment. Anyone entering the pool or bath must soak their feet in this water for a short time to prevent the spread of tinea fungus and the prevalence of athlete's foot. It is now known that the efficacy of this type of foot bath is not reliable and has no practical value.</p>
<p>Treatment Medications</p>
<p>There are many drugs for treating athlete's foot, but so far, there is no specific drug. Also, because the symptoms of each stage of athlete's foot are very different, drugs that are effective for stage A are not effective for other stages, and sometimes even harmful. None of the various athlete's foot lotions or moisture creams sold on the market can be reliably used by patients to treat athlete's foot themselves.</p>
<p>These types of lotions and creams mostly contain salicylic acid and benzoic acid, which are irritating. They have considerable curative effect for chronic conditions, but often have no curative effect for acute conditions, and are instead prone to causing inflammation. In addition, iodine, red medicine, or gentian violet (the main component is gentian violet) also have the effect of killing tinea fungus, but they are also irritating and equally inappropriate. A mixture of phenol and camphor that was popular in the United States seven or eight years ago was also attacked by experts for easily causing irritating inflammation, and soon disappeared from the market. Recently popular sulfonamide drugs, such as Sulfamidazole, are often made into ointments to treat athlete's foot, and there is even a risk of causing allergic reactions. Once this allergic reaction occurs, if it is necessary to use this type of drug again in the future, whether internally or externally, it can cause a reaction, and the severe cases can be fatal. This point will be discussed in another article in the future.</p>
<p>Recently, various fatty acid preparations such as propionic acid (Propionil acid), caprylic acid (Caprylic acid) and undecylenic acid (Undecylenic acid) have been found to have a strong ability to kill tinea fungus and are not irritating. They are gradually becoming widely used in the United States. Another new treatment method is to spray the affected area with ethyl chloride (Ethyl Chlorice) until the local skin is cold and turns white. Its effect is also good. Cadmium chloride solution (Cadmium chloride) has also been tried and is said to have good results.</p>
<p>It is best for patients to use the aforementioned boric acid talcum powder for self-treatment. It is very effective and also safe for common mild cases, and there is no risk of causing inflammation. See foot hygiene section for usage. Once local inflammation and suppuration occur, you should seek medical treatment and not be negligent.</p>
<p>·Key points to note·</p>
<p>1.  Wash your feet frequently, at least once a day, and change socks after washing. Those who sweat a lot on their feet should wash and change more often.</p>
<p>2.  Choose shoes that are breathable and absorbent. Avoid using rubber-soled shoes in summer.</p>
<p>3.  Prepare several pairs of shoes in summer and change them once in the morning and afternoon each day. Place the removed shoes in a ventilated place.</p>
<p>4.  Avoid bad habits such as picking at your toes and pinching your feet to avoid local damage and spreading the virus to other places.</p>
<p>5.  Avoid sharing shoes with others and do not use slippers in public places.</p>
<p>6.  Those who go to public swimming pools or bathrooms should pay attention to rinsing their feet after each visit and sprinkle them with boric acid talcum powder.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Athlete's Foot</h3>
<p>— Cai Junping</p>
<p>Athlete's foot is a very common disease, commonly known as "Hong Kong foot," which often starts between the toes. Most people think it is "dampness" and do not pay enough attention to it. Moreover, they mistakenly believe that the presence of "dampness" is sufficient to reduce other physical ailments. This view is completely wrong. The reason for the error is a lack of understanding of the condition. The error is passed on again and again, causing the condition to be underestimated, often leading to serious consequences. In severe cases, one cannot walk and must stay in bed for treatment, which is no different from other serious illnesses. Patients only seek medical treatment at this time, which is already a considerable loss.</p>
<p>Athlete's foot is a skin infectious disease. It comes from contact with tinea fungi in the air or the belongings of other patients with tinea fungal infections. The location is not limited to the feet, and there is more than one type of tinea fungus. It is more common on the feet because of its suitable conditions. Athlete's foot is called "Hong Kong foot," which shows that it occurs more often in warm and moist places; and the feet are often surrounded by shoes and socks, and in hot weather, foot sweat increases, and heat is not easily dissipated. Both of these conditions are suitable for the growth and invasion of tinea fungi, causing athlete's foot. Sometimes, the fingernails and trunk are also infected at the same time, resulting in a larger range. Tinea fungi are distributed everywhere, and there are also some in the air. The infection is like bacteria. Most people are already somewhat afraid of bacteria and take precautions, but for tinea fungi, they do not pay attention because they do not know its severity. Tinea fungi multiply extremely quickly, and must be at a very high temperature to be killed. Ordinary disinfectants and low temperatures have no effect at all. Therefore, the belongings of all tinea fungal patients must be separated, especially those that have direct contact with the tinea fungal site.</p>
<p>Athlete's foot can be divided into acute and chronic types. Acute athlete's foot is often mistaken for "dampness" because a lot of water is indeed discharged, especially after rubbing to stop the itching. There are many small blisters on the edges of the toes and on both sides of the feet, and the itching is particularly severe, and the skin is red. Chronic athlete's foot is the most common, and is not taken seriously: the area between the toes is slightly moist, the epidermis is white, or there is peeling; the skin on the soles of the feet and the back of the feet becomes dry and thick, and there are occasional cracks. This condition is extremely common. Without a doctor, patients can diagnose it themselves.</p>
<p>Simple athlete's foot is often neglected, and sometimes has adverse consequences. Here are a few common ones: (1) The toenails are extremely prone to turning gray-white and thick. If it spreads to the hands, the fingernails will also undergo the same changes. From an aesthetic point of view, this is very bad. (2) After the skin is damaged by tinea fungi, its resistance is reduced; at the same time, the skin has small cracks after scratching, which can easily be invaded by pus-forming bacteria on the surface of the skin, resulting in infections such as lymphangitis or erysipelas. The condition is that the inguinal lymph nodes are swollen and painful, red lines appear on the inside of the thigh, or there is migratory redness, swelling and pain on the back of the foot or ankle, and the whole body is feverish and chills. At this time, patients have difficulty walking and must lie down. This condition is not uncommon. (3) If there are frequent erysipelas or erysipelas-like infections. The legs and feet can become elephantiasis, commonly known as "big legs". Regardless of other pathologies, both the patient and the onlookers have a bad feeling. (4) If a certain bacterium invades the blood in excessive amounts from the fungal area, it can cause bacteremia, which is a serious condition and can even be fatal. The above are just a few examples. Just in terms of athlete's foot itself, the acute type hinders movement, delays work, and in public institutions, workers cannot go to work and students cannot attend classes.</p>
<p>Therefore, although athlete's foot is a minor ailment, it has its universality and seriousness, and should not be ignored. The prevention method is to isolate the tinea fungus as much as possible; those who have been infected should prevent its development. It is best not to go to public places such as unclean bathrooms and swimming pools. Even in clean bathrooms or swimming pools, you should use your own towels, and rinse and dry with clean water after bathing or swimming. You must always change your shoes and socks, keep your feet clean, keep them dry, and avoid bad habits such as rubbing and pinching your feet.</p>
<h3>Oral Healthcare</h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>Teeth are one of the main organs for eating, and their completeness is closely related to human health. We must not neglect our teeth because they are a small matter, so as not to affect the overall health of our body and mind.</p>
<p>Calcium is the main component of teeth. When infants are in the womb, they absorb a large amount of calcium from the mother's body for the growth of bones. Therefore, Westerners have the saying "The more children you have, the more teeth you lose." Pregnant women should eat more foods containing calcium to avoid damage to their teeth.</p>
<p>When teeth chew food, food residue often remains on the enamel. If it is not washed away, it is easy to produce acidification, which damages the entire tooth. Therefore, if we want to protect our teeth, we must rinse our mouths and brush our teeth after eating. In addition, we must also pay attention to the nutrition of the teeth:</p>
<p>Calcium and vitamins A, C, and D are the main nutrients for healthy and beautiful teeth.</p>
<p>Calcium and vitamin A are found in large quantities in milk and green leafy vegetables, but without vitamin D (sunlight and cod liver oil) applied at the same time, it is difficult to produce the ideal nutritional effect. Therefore, sunbathing has a great effect on the health of teeth.</p>
<p>Drinking a glass of fruit juice rich in vitamin C every day - oranges, lemons, grapes, or tomatoes - is also a way to maintain healthy teeth.</p>
<p>As for eating too much candy, it damages the enamel, damages the roots of the teeth, and creates cavities, so you must pay attention to it at all times. Diseased teeth are also prone to causing indigestion, leading to stomach problems.</p>
<h3>Anemia and Blood Tonics (Part 2) (5) The Basic Raw Materials for Red Blood Cell Production</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changshao</p>
<p>Red blood cells are composed of two parts: hemoglobin and stroma. Both of these components can be manufactured by the body itself, and new blood cells are constantly produced to replenish normal losses and non-excessive abnormal losses. The manufacture of each component requires a basic raw material. A lack of any of these raw materials can affect the new production function of red blood cells and lead to anemia.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the basic raw material for manufacturing stroma is probably the main component in liver preparations, which is the so-called hematinic principle component. A lack of blood tonics will produce a type of fatal pernicious anemia. The characteristic of this anemia is that the red blood cells are particularly large and contain a high amount of hemoglobin, so it is also called macrocytic anemia. Liver preparations have a specific effect on this anemia, while iron preparations are useless. Before the invention of liver preparations, pernicious anemia was an incurable disease, and the patient became increasingly serious until death. The invention of liver preparations saved many lives.</p>
<p>Iron is the basic raw material for manufacturing hemoglobin. Hemoglobin itself is a compound of iron and protein. Naturally, protein is also an important raw material, but because it is very rich in food and easy to obtain, it is not in short supply except for those who are starving, so it is not actually important. Iron is different. Food contains very little iron, which can barely meet normal needs. Once the need increases sharply, it feels insufficient, leading to anemia. The characteristic of this anemia is that the red blood cells are particularly small in size and contain a lower amount of hemoglobin than normal, so it is also called microcytic anemia.</p>
<p>Pernicious anemia is an uncommon disease even in Europe and the United States, and it is even rarer in China, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Ordinary general practitioners rarely see it in their lifetime. Almost all of the common anemia cases are microcytic, and its specific drug is iron. Although liver preparations are extremely expensive, they can be said to be useless. Therefore, for ordinary anemia, whether for prevention or treatment, iron is the most important drug, and it can also be said to be the only specific drug.</p>
<p>(6) Since pernicious anemia is so rare in China, we can disregard liver preparations when discussing blood tonics. Therefore, the terms iron preparation and blood tonic actually become synonymous. All blood tonics will lose their blood-tonifying effect if they lack iron.</p>
<p>In recent years, various isotopes have been produced by atomic energy research and are widely used in medicine as research tools. Since 1938, iron isotopes, namely radio-iron, have been used in various experiments, clarifying many aspects of the pharmacology of iron preparations.</p>
<p>The amount of tin contained in our whole body is only about four centimeters, which is about the equivalent of a two-inch nail. Almost all of the iron in the body is used to manufacture hemoglobin. Adult men need about five to eight milligrams of iron per day to replenish normal losses. Women, due to the loss of blood during menstruation, need about two to four times that amount. Children need even more iron due to development, about 0.6 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. The daily iron requirement during pregnancy is about twenty milligrams.</p>
<p>Foods with higher iron content are red meats, egg yolks, and green vegetables, especially spinach. Human milk and cow's milk contain very little iron, so breastfed babies are prone to anemia and must be supplemented with vegetable juice or fruit juice. Whole wheat flour and brown rice contain more iron than refined flour and white rice. The iron content of chicken, duck, pig, and cow blood is the highest among all foods. The iron content in ordinary Chinese diets is quite high, enough to meet ordinary physiological needs. Those who cook with iron pots have additional iron mixed into their food. However, for anemic patients, the iron content in food is far from enough to meet the needs of treatment, and iron preparations must be used to remedy this.</p>
<p>In the past, there were various misconceptions about the value of iron preparations, which must be corrected. The pharmacology of iron preparations has been discussed in detail in my book Modern Therapeutics, pages 187-191. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>(1) All kinds of iron preparations, from the iron in iron pots and nails to complex organic iron preparations, have completely the same effect and can all be used as blood tonics.</p>
<p>(2) Organic iron is not as easily absorbed as inorganic iron, so although its price is far more expensive than simple inorganic iron, its therapeutic value is far inferior to the latter.</p>
<p>(3) Among inorganic iron preparations, ferrous salts are better than ferric salts because they are more easily absorbed.</p>
<p>(4) The most effective drug is the cheapest ferrous sulfate. The price before the war was only one or two cents per day, and now it is only about ten dollars. The total amount needed to cure anemia is only a few hundred dollars (price a month ago). Liver preparations, which cost thousands of dollars per injection, may scare poor patients with their high price, but other than psychological effects, they have no effect.</p>
<p>(5) The doses of iron preparations commonly used are often too small. Although there are many brands of ordinary blood tonic pills, they are actually nothing more than ferrous carbonate pills. Each pill contains very little iron, and the effective dose is ten to twenty pills each time, thirty to sixty pills per day. Taking this pill is almost like eating peanuts in order to exert its maximum therapeutic effect. However, the ordinary instructions indicate one or two pills each time, which is really too small a dose and takes too long to work. However, readers must not be clever and arbitrarily buy a bottle of blood tonic pills and eat them like peanuts, because ordinary iron preparations themselves are harmless if you eat a little more, but the blood tonic pills sold on the market may also contain other ingredients, and eating too much can easily cause poisoning, so do not be careless. In short, if a patient has significant anemia, they should ask a reliable doctor to prescribe medicine.</p>
<p>(7) Waste! Waste! Waste!</p>
<p>Although there are no slippery doctors among my clinical friends, there are also a few who like to give anemic patients injections of liver preparations. This phenomenon is not uncommon among foreign friends either. Naturally, injection treatment can charge patients more fees, but it increases the patient's economic burden a lot, and this increase is completely meaningless. This is waste! Waste! Waste!</p>
<p>Liver preparations are a specific drug for pernicious anemia and have saved many lives, which is a fact. However, pernicious anemia is extremely rare in China, and many general practitioners have never seen it in their lifetime, which is also a fact. For ordinary anemia, only iron preparations have a specific effect. Liver preparations, whether taken orally or injected, have no specific effect. This point has long been fully proven by world authorities and is beyond doubt. Naturally, the liver contains a considerable amount of iron, and also has vitamins and proteins, so it is okay to eat it as food. However, it is really too unfair and too absurd to spend thousands of dollars for a shot for a tiny amount of iron. Moreover, most of them are imported, and this economic loss is really spent unnecessarily.</p>
<p>China, with the exception of a few cases each year, can be said to be a country without pernicious anemia, and there should be no market for liver preparations. The appearance of various brands of liver preparations on the market, whether they are domestic or foreign products, is like giving scientific medicine a heavy slap in the face. Friends, let us wash away this shame! (Continued on the 2nd of this month)</p>

<h3>Mei Baiqi's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jian Yi</p>
<p>The musician Mei Baiqi (Paci) once served as the conductor of the former Municipal Council Orchestra and was revered as a grand master of music in the Far East. Scholars looked up to him as they would Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. Sadly, he passed away on the 3rd of this month due to illness. People in the art world deeply mourn his passing. Here, we publish a translation of his autobiography written during his lifetime, as a tribute of mourning. — Editor</p>
<p>I was born in Florence in 1878. At the age of seven, I began studying piano at a famous Neapolitan school. At eleven, I gave my first public performance at the now-defunct "Del Foudo" theater in Naples. However, despite such early success, my father would not allow me to dedicate myself entirely to the study of music, insisting that I remain at an academy in Naples as a "student on scholarship." At the age of fourteen, one day, I sold all my books and my only valuable possession—an old pocket watch—and, with a few lire, fled from the academy in Naples to Rome. This was because I knew that the pianist Sgambati (Liszt's last student), whom I admired, was there, and I hoped to see him or become one of his students. But approaching or meeting Sgambati was much more difficult than I had imagined! Two days after arriving in Rome, I took all my sheet music to his stately residence on Via della Croce and tried to explain my situation to a very stern "attendant." However, I was politely refused. Finally, the "attendant" said, "The professor does not receive anyone without a letter of introduction."</p>
<p>At that time, I was a lonely child in the city of Rome. When I had only two lire left, my courage completely disappeared, and I sent a telegram to my father admitting my escape, asking for his forgiveness and help. Two days later, my mother found me waiting for her at the station, full of hope. A decorated room for the two of us was found—an old, small grand piano, and a letter of introduction to Sgambati were all prepared. Thus, the happy life of a "Sgambati student," practicing six or seven hours a day, began from that point onward.</p>
<p>Soon, Sgambati realized that my family's expenses were considerable due to my father's position in Milan and my mother and I living in Rome. After a few months, he was satisfied with my work and interested in my future piano career, so he refused to accept any fees for my lessons. Three years passed like a day, and I no longer needed to go to his exquisite music room to enjoy his deeply moving instruction.</p>
<p>In 1895, at the age of seventeen, I participated in the international competition for the Liszt Prize held in Rome. As a result, I was the winner among sixty-three young people of different nationalities and schools.</p>
<p>From then on, I began my career as a pianist. For an entire season, I gave concerts in Italy, France, Austria, and other places. Only there did I first hear the symphony concerts and great conductors that amazed me. I immediately saw the piano as a pitiful asset in musical expression. The next year, I went to Milan, hoping to become a student of composition and orchestration at the local famous conservatory.</p>
<p>That year, there were only four openings for the "composition course," and it was said that the exam was very difficult and strict. At that time, I was certainly a good pianist, and three years of great teaching and friendship from Sgambati were enough to make me a good musician. However, I lacked the preparation of a music theory scholar—I was very afraid to take the risk.</p>
<p>Luck helped me. At a Milanese social gathering where the Viscount of Modrone, the Mecenate of the Theatre "La Scala," often gathered local celebrities for musical performances, I was asked to perform. After I played Beethoven's "Appassionata Sonata," guess who came to compliment me—Puccini! (A famous modern Italian opera composer). Trembling and happy, I told him my hope of entering the composition class at the conservatory, and the preparation work that worried me the most. "Don't be afraid," he said, "I know all the examiners, and I can give you a card with a few good words." Now, I was a hundred times more courageous. On the designated day, I took my application to the "Examining Committee," and at the same time handed a tightly sealed letter of introduction from Puccini to the chairman. As for what was said in this letter, I had no idea. The chairman looked at the letter, smiled, and passed it to the other examiners, then said to me, "I think we can accept Puccini's advice, but would you be willing to play the 'Appassionata Sonata' for us?" You can imagine how surprised I was by this! I stood there speechless, hoping for some explanation. Then, the chairman called me again and said, "Perhaps you don't know what Puccini wrote for you? Please read this card."</p>
<p>Puccini wrote:</p>
<p>"The young Paci is participating in this exam without prior preparation. But don't waste time testing him on 'forbidden fifths'; instead, have him play Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata." I know you wouldn't want to lose a student with a promising future."</p>
<p>I was relieved. Now, thinking back to the many years since I devoted myself to the life of a pianist, I have never again performed the "Appassionata Sonata" in front of some great music critics (I mean as well as that).</p>
<p>Since studying at the Conservatory for four years, I should thank Puccini's patronage again. I served as assistant conductor in three major theaters in Milan—"Lirico," "Dal Verne," and "La Scala." Therefore, I was able to receive guidance on conducting from many great conductors: Ferrari, Mugone, Mascherovie, and the greatest of them all, Toscanini.</p>
<p>In any case, studying and settling in Milan for four years felt too long to my active nature and temperament. Moreover, in those years, my musical life was focused only on opera, and concerts and symphonies were few and far between, which caused a "pure music" hunger in my nature—as the French say, "One always remembers one's first love easily."</p>
<p>The long separation from the piano had now become such a strong love. One day in 1902, I suddenly decided to restart my travels and wander the world as a pianist. The travels were unlimited until December 1918, when Stock, the famous Far East concert manager, invited me to make an extensive trip to China and Japan. Thus, I arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I arrived in Shanghai on December 28th, but unfortunately contracted a serious illness. When I was carried off the ship to the hospital, my planned trip was canceled. In February 1919, when I was able to play again, I gave my first solo concert at the Lyceum Theatre, and achieved a great success.</p>
<p>But my wandering life came to an end here. During the wandering time forced to stay in Shanghai, I had the idea of ​​organizing an orchestra with talented pianists employed in all hotels and dance halls to accompany my piano concertos. In April, under my own baton, I played Mozart's "Coronation Concerto."</p>
<p>The day after the concert, the newspapers naturally launched a movement to reorganize the Municipal Council Orchestra in a new way. This era seemed to be very prosperous, and Shanghai was happy and full of life. Perhaps I was a little tired of the sixteen years of wandering life as a pianist and dreamed of a future with an orchestra, so I accepted the appointment of the Municipal Council authorities and organized this orchestra.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows the situation in Shanghai in 1919 can easily imagine the reaction of Shanghai citizens after the four years of the war when they heard an orchestra like this and the former Municipal Council Brass Band, which contained only fourteen mostly Filipino musicians. (Translated from the souvenir program of the farewell concert of the Municipal Council Orchestra, 1942)</p>
<h3>In the Church</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic universities, no matter which one, have organizations called "Fellowships." Our place is no exception. Next to the school, there is a small church, beautifully unique like a child. Every Sunday evening, leisurely, gentle, and forgiving singing comes from the small church. Often unintentionally, I am led there by this singing. There, I met a girl. She is a devout Christian. One Sunday night, after everyone who attended the service in the church had dispersed, only she remained. She asked me to stay and talk with her. Before long, she seemed intentionally to steer the conversation to "Religion and Writers."</p>
<p>She spoke gently, like a pastor leading a prayer in a lifelike manner:</p>
<p>"Religion and literature share a common theme and a common purpose. They both explore truth, goodness, and beauty. Their theme is created by the inner meaning and expression of this truth, goodness, and beauty. Their purpose is to use concrete forms and tolerant methods to help humanity reach the highest realm. Therefore, a pastor is also a literary writer. A pastor should possess the inner qualities and cultivation that can be said to have reached the requirements of a writer. He only needs to polish his writing skills more. But a writer needs more religious cultivation and must pay attention at all times. Only in this way can he place his pen on the love of humanity and the lives of the masses."</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, looked at me, and smiled as if waiting for my opinion.</p>
<p>"I agree with your statement, but religion has a god as its master. The pastor's duty is only to convey Jesus's will. But a writer has no one to be his master. If there is one, then it is only the vast people and the real world. One serves God, and the other serves the people. Isn't this a big difference?" I said slowly.</p>
<p>The electric lights illuminated us. The church was quiet. The empty rows of chairs solemnly extended their backrests. In the light, these coffee-colored chairs emitted purple-green light, as if they were attentively listening to the preaching of religion.</p>
<p>"I think this question should be explained like this; that is, to point out what standards Jesus needs and what standards the people need? Undoubtedly, both require gentleness, obedience, meekness, and great love. They are from the same source, so Jesus and the people are not separate entities; there is no mysterious difference between pastors and writers."</p>
<p>Because she knew that I was not a believer, she continued to explain in detail.</p>
<p>"Jesus uses that gentleness, meekness, and love to grasp the ideals of mankind, making him an object of human devotion. There is no doubt about this. But some people love Jesus not because he specifically possesses these spirits, but primarily because they worship him as an idol. This is an unconscious and huge mistake; it also often becomes the starting point for others to attack religion. But in such a situation, the attackers are naturally not shooting arrows without a target, but they should criticize those who have not recognized the meaning of faith, not religion itself."</p>
<p>She seemed to realize that she was overly excited and softened her voice a little.</p>
<p>"Jesus was the first person to discover the soul and confirm its existence, because he grasped a transcendent and elusive emotion. Mr. Lu Xun was one of the people who discovered the soul of the Chinese nation. Ah Q precisely revealed the decadent side of the national soul. If a writer does not have the wisdom and courage to portray the soul, he cannot go deep."</p>
<p>Because I did not object to her opinion, I remained silent as usual.</p>
<p>She asked the church manager to bring us two cups of tea. She took the tea and slowly placed a cup on the horizontal shelf behind the chair in front of me. She held a cup herself and moved it to her lips, sipping it lightly. I picked up the cup of tea she gave me and felt it was warm and fragrant, like a stream of gentle emotion flowing into my heart.</p>
<p>I opened the lid of the teacup, and the hot steam clouded my glasses; after a while, the steam disappeared, and I saw her delicate mouth, continuing the conversation just now.</p>
<p>"A female pastor once told me: Forgiveness is nobler than punishment, and love can soothe people's hearts better than autocracy; to grasp the hearts of mankind as lovely as the fragrance of flowers or the purity of children, this is the gentle and obedient religious thought and behavior. We not only require a writer to do this, but also require him to use his pen to tell people to go this way. ……</p>
<p>"Tolstoy was once a person who most opposed religion, but when he reached his later years, he returned to the path of religion. Indeed, we still have unsound understanding of the attitude towards religion. I often remember Tolstoy's words. It is best to repeat his words now and take the same attitude as him."</p>
<p>He took a sip of tea, and I played with the lid of the teacup, listening to her.</p>
<p>"Tolstoy said that true religion is a relationship between man and the surrounding infinite life that is rational and intelligent, which connects his life with the infinite and guides his behavior. Do you believe his words?"</p>
<p>I nodded, expressing a satisfied smile, and she smiled happily too.</p>
<p>The night was getting deeper, and we stood up at the same time. I looked up at the large crucifix hanging on the wall behind the indoor pulpit, and the surroundings seemed to show a halo of light.</p>
<p>I turned my face and looked at her again. On her face, there was still the usual slight smile. I said goodbye to her and left the church first.</p>
<p>Along the fence, I slowly strolled back to the dormitory. The snow-white marigolds by the roadside looked even whiter in the night. A burst of fragrant spring night breeze greeted me. I looked back at this small church. The girl's words were still in my ears. Although she did not intend to preach to me or ask me to become a believer, I had no intention of doing so either; but I hoped and believed that people should go towards the path of ultimate goodness. - This idea can fill my emptiness, or it can comfort this girl's love for me.</p>

<h3>Shipbuilding (Selected World Famous Paintings)</h3>
<p>— By John Constable (1776—1837)</p>
<p>Displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London</p>
<p>Constable enjoyed fame in France during his lifetime, but it was not until after his death that people in his native England fully appreciated his genius. His father was a wealthy owner of a flour mill. Old Constable originally intended to have him inherit his father's business, so he joined the flour mill at the age of eighteen. However, his talent had to find an outlet, and as a result, his parents finally sent him to London to study art. Two years later, he returned to his hometown and replaced an old employee in the flour mill; after doing it for about a year, he entered the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Initially, he also studied in the traditional way: painting portraits and copying famous works. The first landscape painting he exhibited at the academy received great encouragement and praise from the school's principal. He has always been convinced that he can take the path of a natural painter - emerald green grass, gurgling streams.</p>
<p>"Shipbuilding" was painted by Constable in 1815 and is an important step in his process of creating great works and gaining fame.</p>
<p>Constable was a great painter who loved nature and the countryside.</p>

<h3>People's Words Are Lovely</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Regarding the election of Miss Shanghai, the Jiangsu and Anhui Refugee Relief Association specially entertained the press and candidates yesterday. It is said that Miss Yuan Xuefen of the Yue Opera Group stated on the spot that she did not intend to participate, because of "people's words are frightening". I guess the atmosphere in the field at that time must have been quite tense. This can be understood from Mr. Wu Kaixian's subsequent speech. Mr. Wu said that "people's words are frightening" should be changed to "people's words are lovely".</p>
<p>We have no way of knowing what Miss Yuan's words refer to, but thinking carefully, it must be serious. I remember that the movie star Ruan Lingyu once said "people's words are frightening" before she died. Honestly, a journalist with justice, personality, and awe of the sacredness and importance of his responsibility swears that he must be careful and responsible for his words. As for catching wind and shadows and creating rumors, that cannot be regarded as a vow. Therefore, reports or comments based on objective facts have their power. It is not impossible to say that it is frightening.</p>
<p>In today's society, it is difficult to avoid gossip on any matter. People's minds have fallen into a stage of unbelief, and they like to think about everything from the bad side, like to read negative articles, like to listen to ghost stories, and like to know secrets or privacy. If there is no courage to face this great countercurrent, what way is there to go other than drifting with the tide? Taking the Miss Shanghai election as an example, who is brave, who is cowardly, and who is saying sarcasm from the sidelines is clear. Here, it makes people feel that Miss Yuan Xuefen is still innocent after all. Where are many people who claim to be pioneers in the women's world and claim to be enthusiastic about social welfare? Why don't they come out?</p>
<p>Zilu was happy when he heard criticism. Mr. Wu Kaixian's "people's words are lovely" has a philosophical meaning. The popular saying should be to accept criticism and implement self-examination. If a person can truly feel that people's words are lovely, this person is at least humble, cultivated, and able to respect the opinions of others. Naturally, "lovely" is one thing. It only expresses a person's attitude towards the other person or a state of psychological reflection. As for whether to accept and adopt it, that is another matter, because this involves the judgment and evaluation of people's words.</p>
<p>In the principle of being a person, we should practice "people's words are lovely." Regardless of the other party's motivation or purpose, and regardless of whether it is slander or praise, he is always concerned about himself. Shouldn't we treat people who care about us with good manners?</p>
<h3>The Shady Dealings of Employment Agencies: Hard to Find Good Servants, Even with Money</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Having read your publication's article "Servants Are Difficult to Serve," I deeply sympathize. However, in my opinion, the servants themselves are not as difficult to deal with as the employment agency managers who arrange their hiring. Without immense patience, one can forget about ever finding a good servant. The following is an account of my family's experience in hiring servants.</p>
<p>Last month, my family sought to hire a servant through a certain employment agency on a certain street. The agency manager brought a servant, a woman from Pudong, around thirty years old. My wife questioned her briefly and, finding her character acceptable, decided to try her out. The agency manager demanded 5,000 yuan for transportation fees and, before leaving, specified a three-day trial period. If both parties were satisfied, they would discuss wages. Nothing happened that night. The next day, after lunch, the servant suddenly said to my wife, "I want to leave. I can't get used to working here." My wife asked her what she couldn't get used to, but she only smiled and didn't answer, with the attitude of "stay if we agree, leave if we don't." My wife reluctantly gave her 2,000 yuan in wages and let her go. Because my family urgently needed a servant, I returned to the employment agency and explained the situation. Within two hours, the agency manager brought another servant, also around forty, with a strong local accent mixed with some Jiangbei tones. We agreed to try her out and paid the agency manager 5,000 yuan for transportation. That evening, this servant kept asking my wife endless, bothersome questions: How many "dou" of white rice were used per meal? Who measured the rice when it was washed? Was rice surreptitiously added? How much money was spent on groceries each day? Did relatives visit often? Was the door locked when Madam went to the movies? All sorts of irrelevant and nonsensical questions that made my wife's heart race. The next day, after lunch, the servant announced, "Madam, I want to leave. I can't get used to working here." My wife quickly agreed, "Even if you could get used to it, I wouldn't want you. Here's 2,000 yuan, leave quickly." I switched to another employment agency to hire, and for three consecutive days, I changed three servants, always paying "2,000 yuan in wages for one night and three meals, plus 5,000 yuan for transportation." It seemed they were all graduates of the same training school. Later, one servant actually stayed for a day without saying she would leave. Three days later, the agency manager came to inquire if this woman was satisfactory. My wife patiently discussed wages with him. The result was a monthly wage of 60,000 yuan in legal tender. The agency's fee was to be paid half by the employer and half by the servant. My wife paid him 30,000 yuan upfront. Since the servant had no money, she borrowed a month's wages in advance, and the servant also paid the agency manager 30,000 yuan. This is how we managed to hire a servant. However, on the fifteenth day, exactly half a month, the servant suddenly changed her mind and told my wife, "My mother is sick and urgently needs me to return home to take care of family matters. I'm quitting." She grabbed her bag and left abruptly, without waiting for the owner's permission. Most strangely, the next day, that agency manager even came to visit her. Now, my family has no servant, and my wife does all the housework herself, saving anger and frustration. I vow never to hire a servant through an employment agency again.</p>
<h3>A Laugh</h3>

<p>A: Why did you gamble again?</p>
<p>B: One shouldn't be a slave to money, but should control it!</p>

<p>Sender: Won't adding more stamps make it even heavier?</p>
<p>Musician: I played so well, I moved you to tears.</p>

<h3>Celestial Master Zhang Encounters a Ghost in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Zhang Tianshi, the 63rd generation of the Celestial Masters from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi, recently embarked on an expedition to Wuxi, staying for just over a month. He gained both fame and fortune and formed many connections with local figures. Printing a seal costs 50,000 yuan, a surprisingly high sum. At one banquet, Magistrate Xu jokingly asked the Celestial Master, "I've long heard that the Celestial Master is skilled in magic, with the 'palm thunder' being your signature technique. Today, please demonstrate it to broaden everyone's horizons." The Celestial Master replied, "Palm thunder is used to dispel demons and is only visible to ghosts. It is absolutely invisible to the naked eye." His words were quite humorous. People say that "A Supreme Spirit Tablet knocked down Magistrate Xu." The Celestial Master initiated a ritual at the Jade Emperor Hall on Huishan Mountain to honor the "Martyrs Who Died in the Victory Against Japan" for several days. He also erected a high platform over four "zhang" tall in front of the city library, performing a grand "Flame-Mouth" ceremony. Observers emptied the streets, creating a sea of people. The ghost community also received the flavor of nectar, making it a joyous occasion for both humans and ghosts. The Celestial Master quietly left Wuxi. The reason for his departure is also quite interesting. One day, while performing rituals on Huishan Mountain, a village woman, around thirty years old, wearing a blue "qipao" and black cloth shoes, with glasses suggesting she was not unintelligent, approached the Celestial Master's attendant claiming, "I am under the order of a certain Elder Master to see the Celestial Master." The attendant, sensing her improper intentions, tried to block her, but the woman immediately unleashed her magic, performing amazing feats on the mountain, such as "Running Horses Drinking Water," with impressive skill and technique. At this moment, the Celestial Master felt quite uneasy and secretly changed his clothes to descend the mountain, only to be grabbed by the woman. The Celestial Master exclaimed in surprise, "You are a heretical sect! If you wish to see me, you must follow the proper channels!" The woman shouted, "I am a demon! Why doesn't the Celestial Master capture me?" The Celestial Master was filled with shame. Later, the attendant pulled them apart, and the Celestial Master hired a car back to the city. The next day, he left Wuxi and returned to Shanghai. People say that "Huishan Mountain was originally an area where the Xiang clan's graves were concentrated. That woman was either a witch or a ghost. Celestial Master Zhang encountered a ghost and had no way to use his powers, which is also an interesting story."</p>
<h3>Head-On Collision</h3>
<p>— Zou Shangchang</p>
<p>In this era, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. Money can truly make the devil turn the millstone. I truly gained much insight on my trip to Tianjin. Most of the people on the ship I took were soldiers heading north; there were very few other passengers. I pleaded and begged, finally managing to get a ticket. More than 200,000 yuan only got me a third-class cabin. The deck was so crowded that there was barely any standing room. To buy a berth, one would have to pay 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Two "x x x" on the same ship spent 100,000 yuan to buy two canvas cots to sleep on. "x x x" really got a bargain. When the ship arrived in Tianjin, the two "x x x" took their canvas cots to go ashore, and the steward panicked.</p>
<p>"Sir, you can't take the cots!"</p>
<p>"What? I spent 100,000 yuan to buy two canvas cots. I think I got ripped off! Why can't I take them?"</p>
<p>So they started arguing. "x x x" are "x" people after all, and the steward had no choice. Besides, on the ship, "x x x" are the bosses. So, the steward backed down and started negotiating the price. In the end, the steward refunded 60,000 yuan to settle the matter.</p>
<p>This can truly be called a head-on collision, black eating black.</p>

<h3>Father (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>The hand holding the money trembled violently. Tears streamed down my face, blurring my vision. I vaguely saw my mother standing before me. I didn't know how to thank her. I was truly grateful to her. I never thought she would endure the pain of giving up her prized possession for our sake. Alas! How can such insignificant grass repay the brilliance of spring?</p>
<p>"Liang, time to go to school," my mother's voice sounded more pleasing to me then than even the most beautiful music in the world.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom, I'm going!" I felt a pang of sadness. On the way, I kept wiping my eyes with my handkerchief.</p>
<p>Last winter, although my father had a job, prices were soaring, and his income barely covered expenses, leaving no extra money for tuition.</p>
<p>And because it was the end of the year, debts were being pressed from all sides. My father's efforts to manage often involved suppressing the cold ridicule and abuse from creditors, and he gradually lost his smile. Finally, he even disappeared completely.</p>
<p>What about tuition? We had to find a way again. My father was busy running around outside day and night, talking and negotiating with his friends. Although he never mentioned it to me, I secretly knew that he was working hard for our tuition!</p>
<p>From his dejected attitude and disheartened expression, I could sense the results of his efforts.</p>
<p>Father often worried about our tuition. There were six of us in school. My second brother was quite worldly and didn't often mention tuition to Father. My third and fourth sisters and brothers often nagged Father, "Dad, the teachers at school said that if we don't pay our tuition soon, we won't be allowed to attend." "Dad, why haven't you paid our tuition yet? Maybe they won't accept it later."</p>
<p>Although Mother often stopped them, the stubborn siblings often didn't listen, sometimes making Father angry.</p>
<p>One day, I said to Father, "Dad, let me go into business. Tuition has increased again..."</p>
<p>"There are only six more months until you graduate."</p>
<p>That evening, Father bought four lottery tickets for the drawing the next day. Father was not a believer in fate, and he hated gambling. I had never seen him buy anything like this before, so it made me feel strange, and I couldn't help but wonder for a long time.</p>
<p>Lying in bed at night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The surroundings were quiet, without a sound, except for the ticking of the clock singing a poem. Suddenly, I heard my father's delirious mumbling.</p>
<p>Father said, "Liang, did the lottery tickets win?... "</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Did we win the first prize, or the second prize? Take it to pay the tuition for your younger brothers and sisters, too..."</p>
<p>Father turned over, and the garbled sound disappeared. I strained my ears to listen, but I didn't hear anything.</p>
<p>I couldn't hold back any longer. I hugged my pillow and cried loudly. Father's love for us moved me deeply! What more could I say!</p>
<p>The next day, the lottery numbers were announced, and none of the tickets had won. But Father nonchalantly said, "This kind of thing is inherently a scam. Of course, it won't win."</p>
<p>When school started, Father still gave me the tuition and told me to pay it. I didn't dare ask him where the money came from.</p>
<p>One Sunday, after Father went out, Mother secretly told me, "Your father kept telling me not to tell you about this, but I think it's okay to tell you. This time, your tuition was paid for by your father pawning two fur robes. You should study harder!"</p>
<p>Before Mother could finish speaking, I rushed out.</p>
<p>In the sharp, cold wind, I saw my father's shrinking, shivering figure, struggling, fighting against the sharp northwest wind in the cold. At that moment, there was nothing else on the road.</p>
