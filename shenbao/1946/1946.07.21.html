<h3>主席文告在起草　將重早對國是主張　始終堅持政治解決方式</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿日電話〕蔣主席將於三日內發表重要文告，內容為針對當前局勢說明政府態度，此一文稿現在起草中，全文將長達二千字。唯據某外籍權威人士觀察，蔣主席如發表重要文告，必係說明國民政府對國是之主張，可能不出下列各點：（一）對共產黨問題，蔣主席始終認為應以政治方式解決；（二）政府將忠實履行政協會議之決議；（三）尊重全國人民之要求，擴大政府基礎；（四）政府為欲使政治民主化，決定在十一月十二日召集國民大會，討論　草，制定　法。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿日電話〕蔣主席抵廬山後，贛省父老以其九年闊別，一旦來歸，咸感極大之興奮。茲悉：蔣主席對於江西民間痛苦，至為關懷，為聽取人民之意見，將如過云出巡各地時接受一切控訴，聞中央黨部副秘書長鄭彥蒅，定明日來灣，除為青年夏令營講學外，並將秉命主持處理此項人民控訴事宜。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿日電話〕兩月來政府局部首長之更易，在關心我國前途之盟邦人士中，　已引起充分注意，據刻在此間之某外籍權威人士表示：目前國民政府中之農林部長周詒春，交通部長俞大維，經濟部長王雲五，均屬無黨無派人士，此種趨勢，不但象徵政府延攪人才之迫切，抑足表示依此方向自動而繼續發展，必與政治協商會議決議相吻合，此即謂各黨各派人士參加政府亦將被歡迎也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國防部連日舉行內部重要會議，極為忙碌。並聞陳總長會飛南通等地作極短時間之巡視。又據確悉，國防部白部長將受命赴各地巡視。</p>

<h3>美使返抵京　馬帥昨與贛言席晤談定今明日內返京一行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕關於中央社牯嶺十九日電稱；司徒大使曾暗示「三兩日內時局將有重要發展」一點，今日在首都已引起各方新穎之注意與熱烈討論，街談巷議，多所猜測。記者爲此，特於今日午後走訪司徒大使之私人顧問傅經波氏，傅氏稱：彼對是項消息，亦頗注意，然渠亦不知大使眞意如何，俟大使今晚歸後，當一詢之。至晚十時，記者再赴美大使館時，司徒大使已入寢，仍荷傅氏接見，據稱：大使今日在九江起飛時，以修理飛機機件，故延至四時許，方離潯東來，七時抵京，八時返館，以傷風體溫略增，並微咳，現已登樓休息。大使對中央社記者自渠談話所獲之印象，略感遺憾，蓋渠該次談話，一如日來常與記者所談者，然僅謂「如吾人集中力量，共同努力，短期內必可使時局有所進展。」不斜竟致誤解，希各報記者能了解此意。傅氏稱：大使對中國情形，較爲熟悉，渠與蔣主席竹晤談四次，已使目前中國時局之癥結，有抒解之望。大使切盼我舉國上下各方，一致努力，爲中國人民造福。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺二十日電話〕馬歇爾特使本日上午十一時四十分，曾接見贛主席王陵基；暢談甚久。馬帥表示對廬山各種佈置甚表滿意。以王主席曾游日本，乃問曰：王主席：「現在同盟國管制日本需若干時間，始能促使其侵略之思想全部改正」？王氏即答：「需時十年」。馬帥並於今晚六時摒除所有隨從，單獨與夫人乘轎二頂，遊小天池名勝，覩狀極表愉快。據悉：馬帥返京之期，約爲廿二日上午或廿三日晨，夫人則將暫留此間。</p>

<p>〔中央社海防十九日電〕載軍六十噸裝有紗棉花等物為華僑經營之新廣州機帆船，七月七日上午八時高懸中國旗於駛來海防途中，突被扯有法國旗之雙桅艇一艘攔截，並猛放機槍掃射。該船直駛十分鐘後，復遭遇另一縣掛法旗之小型淺水艇一艘帶同電船一艘緊追其後，逼　附近石山，飭令停駛。船上人員二十四人，全數向山中逃避，法艦遂駛近上船搜查一遍，見無人踪，旋帶同警犬數頭入山搜捕。領水馮亞晚等十一人，遂被拘。當時法兵竟將馮等全數槍殺，並將機帆船拖曳向宮門而去，臨行仍頻頻發砲向石山亂擊，僑胞聞訊，極度憤慨，我駐海防領事館向法方提出嚴重交涉。</p>
<h3>東京澀谷站附近　日警擊斃臺胞　美司令部發表經過</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿日電〕東京市內昨夜發生日警開槍擊斃僑胞事件　美第八軍司令部近日發表，昨夜於東京澀谷站附近中國臺省人民與日本警官發生格鬥，記過死者二人，負傷者十四人以上。憲兵司令部刻正調查該事件原因及所用武器來處。東京市憲兵司令官福林准將所作第一次報吿稱：十九日午後十時，中國軍事代表團張中尉等來司令部報吿謂該晚臺省人分乘數輛卡車行徑澀谷站　近時，遭日本警官隊槍擊，當　有一人斃命，數人負傷。據中國代表團所知，當時死者一人負傷者主人，傷者中當時未在澁谷受治療者復有十人至三十人。而日本方面之報吿，則與中國方面大相徑庭，謂卡車數輛尙有吿普車一輛，轎車一輛行經該處，警官令　車訊問後，即許通過，詎料最後一輛卡車過警察署長，槍彈未命中署長而擊傷警察兩人。其時日方亦向卡車開槍，該車即因引擎受傷而停止。司令部確悉日警開槍結果，臺省人死二人，傷十四人。負傷者即送入美軍醫院治療。據今晨報吿，受傷者均無性命之虞。司令部犯罪搜查部為查明日本警察報吿是否屬實起見，傳訊卡車司機臺人兩人。結果，該兩人承認由最後一輛卡車射擊日本警察，但稱日本警察為令卡車停車，曾朝天開槍。福林準將並否認謠言，謂該次爭鬥並未使用機槍。最後又謂該事件原因在於中日攤販之競爭。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京二十日電〕美憲兵司令部已開始調查昨夜槍殺及槍傷東京我臺胞十數人之事件，據美憲兵司令部發表之正式聲明稱，我臺胞已承認對日警察開槍，惟指責日警察先開槍，臺胞二人斃命，另十四人受傷，一日警察班長及另一巡警亦被創。</p>

<h3>確立我國海軍政策</h3>
<p>我國海軍艦隊一隊，子啊指揮官林遵少將率領下，十九日行抵吳淞，昨日溯江入京，今日將在京受陳參謀總長兼海軍總司令的檢閱。此一艦隊，包括有護航驅逐艦兩艘，永勝，永寶，永寧等掃雷艦六艘，本為美國海軍所有，戰後由美國政府贈予中國。此番自美經古巴，墨西哥，夏威夷，日本等地，到達本國。這一飄揚着中國國旗，海軍旗，及中國海軍少將旗的艦隊，自大西洋經喀利賓海，巴拿馬運河，橫越太平洋以達祖國，象徵着太平洋局面的一新，和我國海軍的新生。茲當其首都檢閱之際，謹表示我們衷誠的歡迎，更願藉此機會，一述確立我國海軍政策的必要。</p>
<p>由於抗日戰爭的敎訓及世界第二次大戰的經驗，我們如果要建立我們的國防，必須積極建立我們的海防，和保衛我們海防的海軍。國防部得成立，表示我們將積極建設我們的國防，是則我國海軍的重建，子啊兼海軍總司令陳誠上將的策劃下，必將積極展開。現有的種種跡象，如次次新艦隊的歸航祖國，美國政府派艦船二七一艘，水上船塢及其它必須設備的共計我國，及調派美國海軍官兵來華協助我國新海軍的訓練，以及我國海軍官兵之派往英美見習，在在都在說明我國政府當局，子啊建立我國國防的努力上，如何重視海軍所負得任務。我們擁護政府這種舉措，而對於盟邦給我們的協助，更表示無限的感謝。</p>
<p>若干人士以為現在已到了原子彈，遠程火射炮，及空軍發揮最大威力的時候，海軍已屬陳舊，似無積極建設之必要；此實似是而非的見解。第二次世界大戰，重新證明瞭海軍作用的重要，及其不可或廢。介入希特勒有強大的艦隊，他的軍隊決不會在那威，荷蘭，比利時，及法國的海岸，隔着海望着邱吉爾的鄕邦而太息，他必定想繼諾曼時代的威廉跨海征英。同時，因為英國有強大的艦隊控有絕對的制海權，終使它的本土不為敵人侵犯。日本發動太平洋戰爭，噪起所嬴的的勝利，主要還是靠它的海軍。當時所謂的「帝國海軍」握有西太平洋全部的制海權，珍珠港的一擊，將美國海軍的主力太平洋艦隊打得破殘不堪。幸而美國海軍的復興能力高，積極重建，不期年而有中途島珊瑚海之捷，終之昔日威風凜凜的「帝國海軍」被打得落花流水。日本海軍的衰敗，促成了日本的崩潰。截止到現在，原子彈的使用，並不影響海軍的威力與作用。比基尼島海面上的試驗，雖其詳盡尙未明悉，但無大損於海軍的作用，仍然至為明顯。</p>
<p>我們自己也因為沒有海軍，所以在這次抗日戰爭中　了大虧。當時，我們一點海防都沒有，敵人在我們遼闊的領海裏，眞彷　入無人之境，因此日寇可以輸送自由。我們決不能讓這種慘痛的經驗重演。我們必須積極建立起我們的海軍。我國的海軍在甲午以前，原已獨步東亞，甲午一戰的慘敗，以及頤和園的營建，使我國的海軍抱殘守缺了五十年。這五十年來不但談不上海軍建設，且因為軍紀的　敗，人謀的不臧，轉使海軍的聲望日趨低落。此次國防部的成立，一掃過去的惡習，又得我們盟邦英美得協助，我國新海軍的誕生，此正千載一時的良機。我們要建設我們的新海軍，必須先確立我們的海軍政策。</p>
<p>第一，我們要確立我國海軍在國防上所負得任務，必使之能充分達成其所負的任務。中國不是一個好戰的國家，它沒有侵略的野心，故我國海軍的建設，以固我海防為唯一任務，不像過去的日本，我國海軍的重建，可以說完全是防衛性的。本此方針，我國海軍應以輕快艦艇為主。現有的跡象告訴我們，我國海軍的重建，正向此方面努力，這是可以使我們欣慰的。我們所要指出的是：我們同事必須努力於潛水艇方面的訓練及配備。我們的國力，不容許我們置有英美那樣的龐大海軍；要使我們的海軍能克盡它所擔負的任務，尤須致力於潛水艇方面的訓練及配備。</p>
<p>第二，日本旣敗，它已不再有稱雄一時的海軍，我國海軍在負有固我海防的任務以外，還應該繼日本之後，多少負有確保太平洋西部海面的任務。因為我國國力還沒有充沛，我國海軍艦隊的編成，不必墨守英美的成規。我們不必做保有五萬噸以上主力艦的夢，但我們必須保有足夠應用的其他艦型。海軍少不了軍港，雖然關於軍港的觀念，與從前麥克麥洪大將在日的時候或已多少有了不同，但我國海港之能被利用為軍港者，為數實在寥寥。繼沙皇之後，旅順將偽蘇聯與我所共用的軍港，故我國軍港的營建，必須子啊南部求之。因之，如果我們積極建設我們的海軍，必須至少同時在三門灣及楡林營建我們的海軍基地。</p>
<p>第三，我們必須造成優良的海軍傳統。在中國陸軍的建立上，保定黃埔都有着它們光輝的歷史，而確立我國新陸軍的傳統。我國致力於現代海軍的建立，為時在五十年以上，迄至現在，還沒有光輝的傳統可言。我們要造成我國海軍的光輝傳統，必須加緊海軍的訓練。英國的格林威治，美國的安拿不里斯，都深印在每個英美人得心中；奈爾遜及保爾瓊斯所遺留給英美海軍的典範，至今長存。我們要建設海軍，必須子啊適當地點設立海軍學校，造就海軍人材，三門灣地當南北洋之衝，似為建立我們的格林威治及安拿不里斯得理想地點。至於我國優良海軍傳統的培養，子啊我國歷史上亦不乏光輝的例子，是以啓發我國新海軍的建立；如明末的鄭芝龍，就是一例。</p>
<p>建設海軍，千緒萬端，斷非本文所能盡言。我們所足以欣幸得，以陳兼總司令的才幹與操守，必能將我國的新海軍建立起來。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕美海軍當局今日發表太平洋戰爭時，日本方面所　大錯，以及當時秘密交涉情形，據謂：依照美軍戰略轟炸機調查隊去秋在東京調查之結果：發現：（一）日本曾於渡茨坦實言未發表前，試　蘇聯居間進行和平談判，（二）日海軍機駕駛員於中途島及所羅門海戰時損失殆盡，致日本　隊此後不復能　航空母艦之保護，日經此損失，以後從未復原，（三）　在瓜達爾加　　之戰時，日高級海軍將領即知己無戰勝可能，（四）日陸海軍曾一度　　合併，但海軍不贊成此舉，（五）美　在所羅門一役勇猛進攻，使日本戰　　　之　　失色，因日本　原　在中太平洋與美　　　　　　戰爭，一九四三年日在托克　所留守軍，尙不足一千人，其主力艦隊已準備於美　登陸時即行逃走，蓋當時航艦上　　　被毀無餘，（六）現代戰爭中之　　消耗，其數量之鉅，　　　　　　之上，日本缺乏汽油　　　船使用，更因美軍潛艦　效甚　，乃益感不支，日本缺乏訓練有素之　機駕駛員，實為此次大戰之致命傷，日本最優秀之飛行員，其中約百分之三　死於中途島一役，傷者百分之四十，其食屲犧牲於羅貝爾島一戰，日本請求進行和平談判內幕，係由海軍參謀長　田述出，據稱：「日本遠在一九四五年五月，即決定進行和平，談判係於六月間在莫斯科及東京分別舉行，但時經廿餘日，一無結果，七月間蘇駐日大使傳已生病，外務省無法　蘇使館保持接觸，乃決然訓令我駐蘇大使，向蘇方提議，由我國派遣特使來蘇，我大使當即遵照訓令於七月十三日向蘇外次提出此意，蘇外次曾問：派遣特使之意何在？是否請求蘇聯居間調停？我大使答稱：是，蘇外次當即宣稱：史　林　帥及外長莫洛托放棄此時均將赴　　坦，惟彼等已允於自　茨坦歸來後再作答覆，實際我政府係於八月八日接獲蘇聯答覆，所謂答覆即與　斷絕外交關係是，職是之故，吾人請求蘇聯居間調解，結束戰事之努力，終吿失敗，交涉期間從未提及任何條件，陸軍主張合併所有軍隊，而海軍則始終反對，如陸海軍實符合併，其領袖人物大約將屬諸陸軍方面，在此領袖之下，可能分為海陸軍二派，惟在陸軍把持之下，海軍不免相形見拙，如陸海軍之空軍實力均無損失，則即不合併，亦無不可，」</p>
<h3>美議員康納萊提出計劃　預防第三次大戰　聯合國機構應增強力量</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美參院外委會主席康納萊今日向參院報告巴黎四國外長會議經過情形，并提出預防第三次世界大戰計劃書，內載建議七項。康氏宣稱，任何大國欲於此時背棄聯合國機構之目標，「簡直是瘋狂」，不可思議。任何大國中，可說絕無一國意欲再戰。美國應以其希望與信仰寄托於聯合國機構，如欲完成此種目的，應依照下列七項方針進行：（一）美國應在一切國際交涉上，堅決遵守法律原則及大西洋憲章所規定之正氣，并勸告其他各國同樣為之。（二）美國應以其派得之足額軍隊，飛機及軍艦，供給聯合國安理會調　，以保持世界和平。（三）美國保持強大陸海空三軍，以保衛本國領土與人民，并　　聯合國憲章之義務。（四）聯合國憲章所規定組織之國際機構，應明文載之於條約。（五）凡牽涉美國及其他關係各國之純法理爭執，美國應服從國際法庭判決。（六）美國應及早設法與關係各國訂立協定，規定原子能及其他大規模毀滅人類武器之管制事宜。（七）美國應全力援助聯合國機構之經濟及社會福利計劃，俾完成維護永久和平所必需之種種條件。康氏最後宣稱，巴黎四外長會議雖已遭遇困難，致無多大成就，然「吾人不可灰心」。</p>

<h3>二次試騐原子彈　將用計時器預防時前爆炸　白朗第中將謂準備已完成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十日廣播：關於比基尼島原子彈演習閃光彈提早爆發一事，據電子專家研究結果，斷定係由　亂的無綫電信號所致。據白朗第司令宣佈：不　將鼗行無綫電通訊試騐，以便查明該項擾亂信號之來歷。此次學習所佈置之　發機關較為複雜，係將閃光彈聯接於發動靶子艦上攝影機之電略內，結果因電路發生錯誤，致於預定時刻前五十一分鐘爆發。白朗第謂：本月廿五日正式舉行原子彈試騐時，將採用簡單方法，以發動原子彈爆炸，因為一提早爆發，將使原子彈試騐之攝影大受影響也，故渠不願冒險。又稱：渠接獲氣象報告，雲寸之威脅至試騐原子彈之日，可望消滅。此次試騐，倘能如預定計劃完成，則渠擬定八月中旬駛回珍珠港，然後飛往華盛頓返任原職。</p>
<p>〔路透社阿派拉欽號十八日電〕原子彈試騐指揮官白朗第中將在麥金萊號旗艦上吿記者稱：七月廿五日之第二次原子彈試騐，均已準備就緒，預料屆時氣候可望良好，若原子彈投入水底後并不爆炸，可用遠處控制法使其成為無害，決無傷人之虞。爆炸後同日內，將派少數船入內探視，其餘船舶，為避免炸後之危險電波活動，須隔五日始可駛入。二次試騐時，將以動物一千二百頭供試騐，其中未曾參加第一次試騐者。記者詢以杜魯門總統擬親自參加二次試騐之　確　，答曰渠無所知。又詢以前次日巡洋艦佐川號上之第三一一號豬於炸後數小時仍在遊泳，現狀如何？答曰現狀良好，僅較喧嘩耳。又據其他官員透露：此次試騐，將採用類似銀行保險庫所用之計時器，防其爆炸過早，蓋在今日用閃光彈預演時，較預定時間竟早五十分鐘爆炸　也。</p>
<h3>原子彈試驗插曲　比基尼島王　貴為艦上客</h3>

<h3>法國向暹羅要求　交出綠玉寶佛　領土爭執主由直接談判解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷十九日電〕據暹羅負責人士今日宣稱：法國曾要求暹羅交出所謂綠玉寶佛，該佛號稱「暹羅之魂」，高二十三吋用不透明　玉琢成，為暹羅最大廟宇神佛之一，至尊無上。法國提出此項要求之根據，係以此佛原本得自法國保護地越南老撾省之郞白拉邦五畫。但暹羅方面則堅持暹羅不但應保持此佛，且要求郞白拉邦領土本身歸還暹羅，該地及佛像均於百餘年前併入暹羅，迄至一八九三年，暹羅始在武力壓迫下割讓法國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社西貢十九日電〕法外交界人士今日宣稱：法政府以為該國在披　上仍與暹羅處於交戰狀態，因一九四一年維希政府在日本壓迫下簽訂之停戰條約，從未　承認。暹羅政府援助安南及老撾不法份子，供給其軍火及金錢，使與法國為敵。法國對於暹羅申請聯合國干涉，當堅決加以反對。法國已通吿暹羅願本友誼精神，討論越南邊界可能的修正。此種修正當以種族的及歷史的立場為基礎，而談判之開始，僅可在暹羅歸還其一九四一年藉日本勢力所獲越南領土之後。法方認為爭執僅可由兩國直接談判解決，不經由聯合國居　。法國對暹羅僅有兩項要求，即（一）歸還一九四一年暹羅所攫取之兩地，（二）賠償暹羅境內法國財產所受之損害，不過此亦「為數甚微」。</p>

<h3>蘇對德國問題立場　與法利益無抵觸　莫斯科重加說明消釋法疑懼</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕關於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫前在四國外長會議對於德國問題所採立場，頃由蘇聯負責人士加以評論云，莫洛托夫外長所採立場，實為利於法國之唯一解決方案，其與法國利益并不相抵觸。法國方面因莫洛托夫外長主張，德國宜在一個中央政府權力之下保持統一，表示失望，毫無理由可言。法國方面又認為蘇聯對於德國問題之提之解決方案，實與法國生存攸關之利益相抵觸，亦屬無稽之談。要之，德國問題如何解決，當以下開各事決定之：（一）法國能否防止英國插足於魯爾區，必要時并自該區與以逐退。（二）法國能否防止英國將魯爾區作為經濟上之戰利品，并阻其利用魯爾區所出產之煤斤。（三）魯爾區若果與德國本部分離，法國能否控制該區。要之，魯爾區雖可以理論上保持自治，而由英法比荷予以共管，但因英政府之勢力足以左右荷比兩國政府之故，法國終必處於少數地位，其可能享受之利益亦絕無保障可言。反之，蘇聯所提方案，乃可使法國堅強立足於魯爾區，并保衛其利益，故以蘇人觀點而論，莫洛托夫外長所提方案，足以比例代表歐洲各種勢力，其不利於法國之處　　甚少</p>

<h3>本市文化界名流　茶會招待胡適博士　勿悲觀勿失望　盡力改善現局　胡氏演詞勸勉痛下硏究工夫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕胡適至先生回國已經兩個星期了，昨天下午四時，本市各大學校長暨文化界新聞界教育界諸位名流，在國際飯店聯合舉行了一個歡迎胡先生的茶會。出席的除胡先生外，有吳國楨市長，何德奎秘書長，顧毓琇局長公私立各大學校長吳保　，李壽雍，朱恒璧，董洗凡等，各報社社長程　波胡健中馮有眞等，各文化團體領袖顏　慶等，約四十餘人。</p>
<p>首由本報社長潘公展氏代表數十位主人起立致詞。他說：上海的文化界，自從胡先生回國之後，早就準備歡迎，而且事實上已經準備好了兩次。不意胡先生到了上海之後，身體不大舒服，後來又因事匆匆晋京，所以總沒有能够和大家相見。前天我和顧局長從南京回來，正好和胡先生同車，方才約妥在今天舉行一次簡單懇切的茶會。因為胡先生怕煩，所以邀請的朋友並不過於廣泛。胡先生一向從事教育和學術研究，但同時對國事卻總是非常關心。七七事變的當時，大家應召到了　山，胡先生對抗戰到底，絕不中途妥協的國策，也是堅持最力得一位。那一次廬山會談以後，就發動了轟轟烈烈的全面抗戰。胡先生先是道國外擔任文化使命，致力國民外交，後來出任大使，數年之間，更增強了中美兩國的交誼。卸任之後，胡先生仍舊從事教育學術工作，間接有助於外交，功績極大。這次胡先生於勝利後歸國，正値國家建設方在開始，一切進展的情形，或者未能盡如理想，我們很願意一　胡先生的偉論。請胡先生在今天的茶會中，視同家庭間的談話，以思想家的態度，親切賜敎，使我們從事文化工作者能得到一種新的啓示。深信胡先生這次海外歸來，出長北京大學，貢獻於國家的一定更大，敬以淸茶一杯，恭祝胡先生健康！</p>
<p>全體愉快地立了起來，向胡先生舉杯致敬。歸坐之後，胡先生笑容可掬地再掌聲中起立致詞，作他歸國後的首次公開演講：</p>
<h3>出國九年　回憶一段</h3>
<p>胡先生說：「九年來一向留在外國，好久沒有穿中國衣服，好久沒有說中國話，這次說話，也許要帶出外國字來了，請大家不要見怪。承蒙諸君招待，非常感謝，祗是因為回國十小時以內，就鬧腹瀉，非常狼狽，所以兩次定期，都不能到，先向諸位道歉。」</p>
<p>「這九年之中，諸位在淪陷區，在後方，所作的許多抗戰工作，我都沒有參加；所受各種苦痛，也沒有受到。好像是國家放了我九年假，現在回國，眞有一中假期終了的感覺。」</p>
<p>「剛出去的時候，完全是考察性質，奉政府非正式的使命，去看看美國對我們抗戰的輿論和態度。後來，奉中央硏究院歷史語言硏究所之命，出席在瑞士舉行的國際歷史科學會議，那時一九三八年，這個會議，我國還是第一次參加。自歐洲回美，就奉命回到外交方面工作了。」</p>
<p>「我在一九三八到一九四二這整整四年之中，擔任着外交工作，責任實在是非常輕鬆的。每天不過換幾套衣服，出席幾次茶會或者Cocktail　party,沒有訂過一次條約，沒有接洽國一次借款，沒有捐過一筆錢。而且，我對他們說老實話，不講究外交詞令，我們有困難，就老實實告訴他們；我要他們知道中國是一個文明的國家，中國人是老老實實的人。」</p>
<p>「後來，我的任務沒有以前輕鬆了。政府已經看到，在我們一國單獨挺身抗戰之外，還必需要注意世界局勢的轉變。不過老實說，我實在還是一無成績可以報吿給諸位聽的。」</p>
<p>「我子啊沒有遞國書的時候，廣州失陷了，在遞國書前三天，武漢又陷。這正是國家最倒霉的時候。雖然我們一向主張說負責任的話，不怕人家笑駡，不怕人家嫌我們不是貓，但是子啊這廣州武漢相繼淪陷的時候，我覺得這態度還不夠，覺得我自己還應當參加判斷。我的報吿是否準確，在歷史上可以起作用，——我覺得祗說負責任的話是不夠了，我覺得實際負責任，比說話搖筆桿的負責任，還要艱難。寫文章的人往往隨便議論，並且常歡喜寫翻案文章，但負責辦事的卻不容許如次的。」</p>
<p>「一九四二年秋天，本來想回國，但是我有心髒病，一聲說不適宜於高飛，而在重慶，常常要跑很多石級，昆明又是拔海六七千尺高的地方，有心臟病的人都不相宜，於是，又在美國耽擱了幾年，當時想回國從事文化工作的願望，也不能達到了」。</p>
<h3>不說話不招搖　專心讀書硏究</h3>
<p>「出國的最初五年，從未從事學術硏究，一篇文章不寫，一點考據和硏究的工作也沒有作，即使演講，業從沒有什麽心得。雖然得了三十一個榮譽學位，卻並不是用工拿來的。於是下了一個決心，在一九四二到一九四四這幾年中，努力於「無聲無臭」，「無聲」是不說話，「無臭」是「不招搖」，專心讀書硏究，利用這個國家給我的假期，訓練自己，預備回國來做一個教書匠」。</p>
<p>「去年九月，政府發表我做北大校長。事前，敎育部合我沒有一個字的聯絡。因為他們曉得我有一個弱點：國家在艱難的時候，政府發表我什麽事，我是從不遲疑，從不否認的。北大的職務是一種光榮，但也是很艱巨的工作。我願做一個教書匠，一個史學家，這一點就算是我這餘年中的一些「野心」罷」。</p>
<p>「主人要我就一個新從外國回來的人看法，對國內一個新從外國回來的人看法，對國內情形說些話，題目太大了，不容易交卷。在國外的人，常常看見大處，不見小的地方，因此有時就看到了整個的一面，不挑小眼兒。但是回國之後，才知道和國外所聞，的確有血多不同的地方，十個月前所樂觀的，十個月后也許就有可以悲觀之處。我從本月五日到上海，至今才兩個禮拜，晤見朋友不少，上海的名片有兩寸高，南京的名片也有兩寸高，聽到的話，悲觀的居多，對將來並且很有抱失望的。但是我雖去國九年，並沒有合國內隔離，更從沒有減少對國內的關懷。我以為，用硏究歷史的態度看起來，我們是用不着太悲觀的」。</p>
<p>「九年以前，或者十五年以前九一八事變的時候，我們都曾仔細考慮過局勢，我也從不主張輕易作戰。爲什麽呢？就因為我們經濟，文化，工業等等的基礎，都有些不敢接受這種挑戰，打這空前大仗。到廬山會談的時候，我們認為忍受得已經够了，正像一個患盲腸炎的人，明知開刀可以有性命危險，但是爲了保全自己的生命，也不能再怕冒險。所以，我們就接受了挑戰，參加了戰爭，一打就打了八年」。</p>
<h3>勝利不是休息</h3>
<p>「用硏究歷史的眼光看起來，我們現在所受的痛苦，一部份固然或者還是由於我們的努力不夠，但大部份或者還是因為歷史上的必然。以麼過之富強，勝利以後，至今也還沒有恢復常態。所以，我們現在雖然已經勝利，卻決不是已到了休息或者「寫意」的時候。存了這樣的想法，我們也許就不至於他悲觀了」。</p>
<p>「我們應當硏究我們的缺點究竟在什麽地方，是人才嗎？學問嗎？然後努力加以克服。也許我們要再吃苦而不作探討和硏究，那麼吃苦的時間祗會更延長。我們文化界，敎育界，應當在這五年十年之間，咬緊牙關，盡力挽救和改善目前的局面，如果我們自己先就悲觀，覺得世事不可為，那末國事眞更將令人悲觀，令人覺得不可為了。」</p>
<h3>軍法處深感棘手　糧貸案查無實據　當局考慮諮詢各審核委員　警備部查封蘇州利農糧行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸案之審訊，目前又已告一段落，現僅餘十四家糧商之賬冊尙未查核完竣。據悉關於望達人任星崖之貪污嫌疑，及長江三泰等之囤積嫌疑，均未能獲得確切之證據。警備部軍法處及稽查處曾設法偵查汪達人及其妻之私人存款，但尙未發現有巨額出入之數，同時三泰吳蓉生　稱所有米糧係受當局委託，而長江公司附設厚生公司之米，最近浙江糧貸處，亦曾以證件證明係由該處貸購。現最高當地局雖巳諭令將本案嚴辦，但法律審判須重證據，故軍法處辦理此案極感棘手。又聞警備部目前正在考慮邀請當時審核糧貸辦法之各委員諮詢云。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿日電〕淞滬警備司令部昨派單葆元葉　來蘇，查封齊門外利農糧行，事先至蘇縣府請求協助，經派田糧科及警察局會同前往，僅查獲暫記賬簿及現金九萬五千餘元，逐件封存。記者特就此事趨訪有關當局，探詢案情，據吿係因非法運用滬三泰公司糧貨款項，為淞滬警備司令部查覺發封，以待硏詢。</p>
<h3>救國之道太多　只在世間兩字　顏惠慶對胡氏觀察表示欽佩</h3>
<p>胡先生在掌聲中歸坐之後，顏惠慶先生立起來說：「我和適之先生的關係，相當的長，他當學生德時候，到清華來考出洋，我那時就和清華有一點關係（記者按，那時顏先生恐怕就是清華校長），後來在太平洋學會上也常常見面。前六七年到美國去，和胡先生更是常見，可以說交情相當厚。中國派外交使節到美國去，已經有七十多年的歷史了。我在宣統二年到美國去做參贊，美國的幾位老太太常常問起一位張欽差，張欽差儀表俊偉，使她們非常還念，不過他是不會說英文的。後來，伍廷芳先生穿了長袍玄褂，小小的瓜皮帽上安一塊玉圭，英文說得流利了，榮譽學位得了不知多少。那時我是使館裏一個小小館員，伍先生的演講稿倒都是我起草的。不過，我國以學者出國任國家代表，胡先生要算是第一人。他出國之前，我們都有些懷疑：誠然胡先生的學問道德都不成問題，但是能不能勝任外交職務呢？等到我六七年前到美國去之後，才知道他眞是得到了成功，他代表了中國人的人格和學問。我想他榮譽學位之多，恐怕也要到二三十來個罷？英國蒲　思博士　美，英國人以為這可使兩國文化交流，最可聯絡國家間的感情。適之先生子啊這一點上業替中國做到了。胡先生現在說話已經受了他外交事業的影響，他剛才就說得非常婉轉，非常的「不易明白」，不過他的意思非常對。二十年前，我與丁文江，周寄梅等幾位先生常常在一起談救過之道，有人說科學救國的，有人說讀書救過之道太多，不過其實只有一個小小的四個字母的英文字「Time」。我想適之先生的意思，恐怕也就是指這個。我們根本子啊什麽地方都太落後，什麽方面都比人家差得太遠。但是，中國的前途是絕對沒有問題的，一定可以樂觀。不過，如果要一跳到就跳到第一等強國，卻恐怕很難。H.G.Wells在他的新著“Destiny　of　Homo　Sapiens”裏也有對文化界的勸告。他說，一個民族的發動點就在「腦殘」，也就是說思想，文化。希望大家下過這種根本工夫，國家的前途就一定有很大的希望。」</p>
<p>最後，程滄波先生說：「我們不須悲觀，也不必歎息。我們領導全國思想的人，更應當振作起來。我們感謝胡顏兩位先生爆穀機的指示。」</p>
<p>兩位大使子啊會後談得非常　熱，他們和每一位到塲的客人熱烈握手。散會的時候，鍾上正指着六點鍾。</p>
<h3>虛太夫人　八秩大壽　孫院長明日為母稱觴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月廿二日，為孫總理德配盧太夫人八秩大壽之期，孫院長哲生特迎至上海，即將稱觴祝　。太夫人在抗戰期間，避寇澳門，常至街頭散步，因藹然可親，市人無不爭表愛戴。此次轉港來滬，得與孫院長旦夕相聚，精神尤極愉快，近更常　第出遊，或應各親友宴會云</p>
<h3>加強市郊治安　軍警憲組巡查隊</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令部，為加強本市市郊治安，取締散兵遊勇，特聯合滬郊駐軍一四六旅，憲兵二十三團，暨市警察局組織市郊巡查隊，業於昨日起開始正式服務，經常巡邏於吳淞，大塲，眞如，法華鎭及龍華五處，以確保滬市安寗，子啊浦東區亦有同樣組織。</p>
<p>又本市包圍團自奉命撤銷後，善後事宜統交警察局辦理，現已逐漸改編就緒，將常備包圍團員一千八百人，分別安挿，充當警察俾加強巡防工作。尙有二千八百餘人，則編入一五警察隊。</p>
<h3>遊行毆辱案宣判　四被告各處徒刑　並賠償被害人醫藥損失費</h3>

<p>被吿徐大毛，刁敏之，朱講生，阮光裕，於本年六月廿三日因歡送「人民代表」馬敍倫等晋京，各先後參加列隊遊行，上午至北火車站歡送後，中午行經河南路近南京路時，徐大毛見學生兪晋榮散發傳單與遊行人，將其頭部臂背退步毆傷，用繩反縛其手，使跟隨遊行至大世界，推上卡車，由刁敏之朱講生看守，行經靑年會，又見樓上有人散發傳單，徐大毛與遊行隊組長糾察等數十人，　湧至靑年會二樓，見會計張庸責問，張庸告知該會未發傳單，又至九樓查看，與茶役爭執，經旁人勸阻回至二樓　住住張庸毆打，推至門外，毆傷其背胸頭部，用　反縛，亦使隨行，至馬浪路，有人謂張庸係「國特」，搜查其身，用紅色油漆寫「特工」兩字於背，推上卡車後，遊行至復興公園，徐大毛因力乏僱三輪車圓廠，行至古拔路附近，經顧欽樑，黃家慶看見，叫其停車送至警局，遊行人在復興公園有人宣傳公審張庸兪晋樂之際，經警查悉亦上卡車開至警察分局，將在車之刁敏之，朱講生，阮光裕遊行至靑年會，見人毆打張庸時，亦幫助叫打，在該會觀踢足球及飲茶後下樓，經李兆麟等見其前曾叫打，即拱送警局，學生何學淳在家中樓上見遊行經過散髮傳單，亦被人拖下傷反縛，鞋子於背，押上校中卡車，遊行至復興公園，拉塌車之邱生慶，亦於同日受人之託，下午二時子啊靑年會門口發傳單被人毆傷鞋子於胸，帶至復興公園置於卡車上，經警一併將車開走，將各被害人送往南洋醫院醫治，塡單轉送檢查官偵查起訴，張庸附帶民事訴訟，請求賠償損失費計西裝一套，國幣三十萬元，汗衫一件四千元，派克五十一號自來水筆一枝十二萬元，圖章二方一萬元，登報聲明遺失圖章廣告費一萬八千元，醫藥費九千元，身上失去國幣三萬七千元，公四十九萬八千元，兪晉樂與法定代理人附帶民事訴訟請求了賠償醫藥費國幣二十六萬元，　衫一件二萬二千元，汗背心一件二千元，派克藍寶石自來水筆一枝八萬元，失去國幣二萬四千元，共計三十七萬八千元，何學淳及法定代理人附帶民訴請求賠償損失如淸單，計國幣十萬五千元到院。</p>
<h3>理由</h3>
<p>查被吿徐大毛等均認該日歡送人民代表晋京參加遊行，否認傷害人之身體妨害自由，但徐大毛所舉證人張培新，湯桂芬，孫敬，徐惠淸，顧亮等遊行時或在最後，不足證明徐大毛有無罪行，與徐大毛同行之劉阿根所供在復興公園之情形，有與徐大毛所供未進公園之詞不符，均不足採，證人梁潤朱慶年雖稱與刁敏之同隊遊行，但刁敏之係子啊隊外貼標語，非常列隊中，不足證明未看守兪晋榮，兩被害人兪晉榮張庸均明確指證徐大毛如何與遊行人共同毆打，反縛其手，隨隊遊行，如何押上卡車，至復興公園，歷歷如繪。</p>
<p>復有證人顧欽　，黃家慶見徐大毛在靑年會行兇，子啊古拔路與其相遇，即叫其停車，扭送警局，並經醫院診治兪晉榮張庸塡列診書，附應依法論科，兪晉榮並相證被吿刁敏之朱講生共同在卡車上將其看守，隨同遊行至復興公園，並由警察將卡車開往警局，將被吿扣押，則其幫助以非法剝奪人之自由，亦不容空言否認，惟應減其刑，但未傷害兪晉榮，加害張庸不負共同刑責，被吿阮光裕遊行至靑年會離隊，至該會見人毆打張庸，亦幫助叫打，旣有李兆麟證明，阮光裕亦稱我在靑年會觀踢足球，飲茶後由電梯下來，至二樓許多人說我發傳單，被李兆麟帶至警局，足證幫助傷人罪行，惟係幫助，應予減刑，又未滿十八歲，應予再減。何學淳邱生慶雖亦被遊行人加害，但非被吿等所為，何學淳邱生慶在審判中或在警局亦稱認不清何人加害，則各被吿不服此種形式責任，和學淳與法定代理人附帶民事訴訟，請求賠償損失，即難謂有理，張庸對於刁敏之朱講生及阮光裕除傷害之部份外，附帶民事訴訟請求賠償損失亦同無理，應予駁回。至其向徐大毛所求賠償損失，如事實欄所開，除西裝一套尚未全毀應予酌減外，均認為有理，酌令賠償損失醫藥費共三十萬元，其向阮光裕附帶民訴，請求連帶賠償醫藥費九千元，固有理由，應令與徐大毛連帶賠償，其餘損失據供：在馬浪路有人謂係「國特」而被搜查，所受損失即不能向阮光裕請光裕請賠償，應予駁回。兪晉榮與法定代理人附帶民事訴訟向徐大毛請求賠償損失，如事實欄所開，當屬有理應令賠償，而向其他被吿請求賠償則無理由，亦予駁回。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第二九一條前段，第二九三條第一項，第五〇六條第一項第二項，第五〇七條第一項前段，刑法第二八條第十八條第二項，第三十條，第五十條，第五十一條，第五款，第六十六條前段第七十條，第二百七十七條，第一項，判決如主文。</p>

<p>〔大華社南京訊〕敵偽奴化敎科書，在敵日投降前，曾大量印製，八月間敵日投降時，各校尙未開學，書籍未曾批售，故存書甚多。刻據書業中人言，此與年來國定本敎科書印數稀少，負責供應制度未能推行，及書業恐慌造成之原因，息息相關。最近南京當局，以報載消息，現時寗波等處，尙有阪售及採用偽課本情事，頗爲震怒，已下令嚴厲查辦。又國定本在渝出版之初，承印書商，與敎部協訂合約，內敝明其全國分支機構，不得經售偽組織敎科書，但目前發現之偽課本，其末頁即印有與發行國定本相同之「印書館」名稱，故各方頗多主張依法追究責任者。而國定本中，尙未出版之科目，坊間各書局大率以已失時效之戰前舊本充數，且因上海各家藏版，敵偽時代密查甚嚴，故最近流行本中，仍多偽敎育部修改之處，荒謬欠當之文字頗多。此項情形，已引起敎育行政當局之注意，正在尋求解決之方。至各書售價，雖准採用加成辦法，照定價一千六百倍實售，但底價應以戰前曾奉核准之原價爲準，凡經敵偽增竄之定價，應屬無效，庶符法令，並减輕學生負担云。</p>

<h3>江海關最返發表　五月份進出口統計　進口總值爲八百十三億　出口較四月增加二倍弱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據海關發表之五月份進出口統計數字，本市五月份之進出口總值，約爲八百十三億元。較四月份之進口總值八百十五億元，已略形減少。惟本市五月份之出口總值，則已增至一百十一億元。較四月份之出口總值四十億元，已增加二倍弱。實爲出口事業萎　聲中一良好之現象。以比例言，本市五月份進出口數字，約爲八與一之比。以價值言，本市五月份之進口中，仍以棉花居首，計達四百四十七億元。次爲汽油，約佔三十二億元。再次爲鐵道及電車道用之客車貨車等，亦佔三十一億元。聯德五月份進出物資中，亦以棉花居最多數，計佔一百五十億元。次爲車輛船艇，約佔三十九億元。小麥又次之，佔三十四億元。五月份之出口中，仍惟廠絲佔首位，約達三十億元。次爲皮及棉織品，各約佔十三億元。（進出口統計詳細數字，請參閱下列統計表〕</p>
<h3>多方獲利出籠　股票又告回落</h3>
<p>華股昨初堅後疲，中途極爲混亂，雙方掙扎殊烈，大多頭乍進乍售，捉摸不定，中途最俏時永紗見新高蜂七三五元，美亞五一七〇元景福三三〇元，新光三二五元，勤興二四五元，近午境况頓又慘厲，籌碼大鬆，一瀉而下，竟吿無人維持之象，永紗六五〇元，美亞四四五〇元，景福二七五元，新光风二六五元，勤興二〇五元，午收稍盤，結果較前收計永紗微挫，美亞跌半成，景福新光勤興各跌一成左右，冷門中小各股，初穩繼回，結果亦略帶小，元老股高後見低，結果仍稍微升，收後喊價稍有回上。</p>
<p>外股昨初堅疲，多方獲利出籠，高價勢難持久，加之華股反動下落，更難振作，怡紗自高價一一三〇〇元，英聯一一五〇〇元，逐步回落，近午都呈低價，結果較前收怡紗英聯亞洲雖挫而不多，業廣紙業會德豐跌半成左右，鋼業挫落一成，怡啤尙平。</p>
<p>金鈔均平穩　較前收微升</p>
<p>烚赤昨由平見穩，晨初一九五萬五，開盤後證券活躍，一度見呆，低價退至一九四萬五，銀樓帶稍有納胃，而後見穩，十時後中央配給三十五條，價一九五萬五，此後盤旋而已，午刻證券帮略有補進，回升至一九七萬五，午後稍穩，但以週六之故，較爲冷淡，結果較前收升一萬七，飾金微高，紋銀銀元均平，暗息仍站一角二分左右。</p>
<p>外幣亦初平繼穩，晨開二五〇〇元至二五二〇元，開後曾微現不支，十時後始自二四九〇元買價，逐漸盤升，午刻升至二五五〇元，午後稍有扳高，成交不暢，結果較前收升四十元，對黄金套價在七七四元半對十兩，對英滙兌套價三元五角四分，港粟初平繼堅，結果較前收升二元，港滙仍在五五〇元至五六〇元，印滙六六〇元至六七〇元，英滙八千八至九千，美滙仍鮮變化。</p>
<h3>公債交易清淡</h3>
<p>公債昨仍吿寥寂，成交不到百萬，統丙初自八四〇元退至八二〇元，近午稍有補進，回升至八七〇元，始形平定，大勢尙穩，丁種亦然，甲乙戊則稍掙扎，結果均微降。</p>
<h3>定貨不如收現</h3>
<p>小五金比美價爲低</p>
<p>據進出口業權威方面稱，近日美貨到埠頗湧，搜購者亦多，原因係美國物價劇增，而一般到貨又無正確日期，不若在本巿收購現貨較爲合算，又五金一類，絞鏈螺絲等美貨定價，則超過國產品，戰前此項物品，曾出口南洋羣島一帶，極有信譽，數量亦甚可觀，雖目前工資激增，但至今價目仍較美國爲低。</p>
<h3>下星期起三　食油恢復配售</h3>
<p>中國植物油料廠，前爲增進送貨效率起見　將原定甲乙丙三組，每組二百戶油舖，輪流配售食油之編號，重新改編，決定於下星期三恢復配售制度，每戶仍保持一桶爲限，含量三担半，當天開價，隔日交貨，爲節省時間計，一律改用支票，代替本票，按昨日巿塲油價，每担計六萬一千元，恰與該廠於三月二十日起開始配售時同一價格，又悉該廠於本月八日暫停配售迄今，每日在巿塲陸續拋售食油總量，亦有數千担左右。</p>
<h3>柏油走勢稍疲　今後仍須看穩</h3>
<p>柏油自返來銀根奇緊後，漲風爲之頓戢，返日來因皂用勢懈，交易未若前週熱鬧，而各行家又在手貨備足之時，均思脫售，市塲上轉爲供過於求之狀態，形勢稍疲，惟此乃一時間趨勢，緣各處存底極薄，浙路反見俏勢，漢市亦穩固異常，故本市形情雖疲，但欲望跌，恐非易事，今後巿面仍是　穩，各行售盤未有變更，計列於下，禾本柏油八萬五千元，內坪柏油八萬元，獨砠七萬八千元，的千柏油七萬五千元，普通蘭柏油七萬二千元，麻城柏油七萬元。</p>
<h3>美棉價新記錄　廿三年來之最高價</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十日電〕紐約棉巿昨日開盤時甚爲穩定，但旋即發生波動，急激上升，不久由於拋出之故，價格一度回落，惟有限，巿塲重趨活躍。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十九日電〕紐約棉巿，今日由於外間競購之故，急劇高昇，價格創造二十三年之紀錄。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十日電〕參院已通過取銷棉花統制，該案現正送白宮簽署中。</p>
<h3>中砂白實行平售　閩粵臺糖絡繹運到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨糖市緊勢未衰，靑糖仍在上展中，號貨有潮帮開出提莊靑八包，九萬元，冲提靑八萬八九千元，又升一二千元，黄崗靑數十包，八萬六千元，次潮靑二三十包，八萬一千地，建帮開出刁靑六十包，八萬六千元，中砂白昨係實行平價之日，凡第六期八萬元申購者，均照八萬六千元售出，並有買方證明文件，以資查考。</p>
<p>又訊，台北輪運來臺四萬餘包，招商局延閱輪前到滬，亦遝來一萬五千包，聞近來非但台糖絡續而來，即閩粵食糖亦紛紛到滬，准糖價依舊昂貴，</p>
<p>據悉：第七期台灣食糖，決由台灣糖業公司直接配售與本巿南貨業及茶食業店號六百餘家，前昨二日各該業同業公會負責人曾兩度與社會局方面協議實施辦法，聞最近期內即可實現，據該局經濟行政處顧處長談稱臺糖公司現已允許照每担七萬五千之價格現在正着手議定其零售價格，各該店號本週（即第一次）所擬申請之臺糖大致爲三千包，價目則仍在酌議中。</p>
<h3>木材之新來源　菲島已恢復出口</h3>
<p>〔路透社馬尼刺廿日電〕一九四六年初，菲律賓羣島有鋸木工廠一二家，每日生產　達一二〇，〇〇〇呎，約爲戰前生產量之百分之一二，雖然此等鋸木廠之產量，均供給菲島之需用，惟一九四六年歲末，就中數廠，在採雙班制後，當能恢復少數之出口，其對於目前中國所關木荒，當可能成爲少數之來源地云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨木材市况，洋松市况呆疲，杉木價亦不振，近日來紅星牌紅柳介方，價頗俏俐，因市上短平房多用此板作門扉也。</p>
<h3>外銷茶價不易接近　內銷中檔貨最俏利　屯溪存貨不易拋售</h3>
<p>向銷客帮之苞種綠茶，昨日天津帮等進出頗活，惟品質高者，供應尙有，中檔貨存底較薄，賣戶堅持，行情略吿升起，其他花色內銷亦均未見減，市况無甚出入，洋莊茶巿，印商裕隆洋行對於台灣中紅·雖有騐看還盤，然給價每担使在五萬元關內，客方索價則須關外，致成交興否，尙在醞釀中，至於溫州新珍眉，出口行家照原價續有吸進·</p>
<p>屯溪茶巿近日異常沉寂，各茶莊進胃極薄，現夏烘靑（子茶）每担十一二萬元，整錄毛茶（春茶）每担十萬至十一萬，次等八九萬元，茶戶及茶販，約有二千担毛茶尙未拋出，各洋莊廠號如大中國茶葉公司興華公司安徽公司大地茶廠以及其他私人茶號，均積有毛茶數百担，迄未開工精製，據一般觀察，洋莊如無起色，有改製內銷茶之可能。</p>
<h3>洋秈一致下挫　早稻六萬進關</h3>
<p>昨日南北米巿塲客貨登記總達一萬一千七百十五石，內計北巿塲七一二八石，南巿塲四〇六三石，米號自運自銷五二四石，南巿塲跌勢尤勁，早稻已進六萬元關，洋秈一致下挫一千至二千元，北巿塲埠秈高貨稍秀，白元亦見生氣。</p>
<p>麵粉仍居暫定之格，麩皮挺立，小麥各埠消化依然動而不旺，且提高殺次頗烈，蠺豆平平，中下貨則猛落二三千元，生仁芝蔴彷彿，黄豆平庸，油價止漲轉跌，回小千餘元，配油已發，消塲轉懈，各埠消化亦停，後形趨疲，豆餅肥田去化富令形勢堅挺。</p>
<h3>美洲桐油產量大增加　英國每噸價二三五鎊</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿日電〕目前英國擁有之桐油存底已達危殆之低落水準，供應部爲迅謀挽救此等局勢起見，向市場搜購遠東桐足，數屋期來，英國收購遠東桐油價爲每噸二一四金鎊，惟中國出口商家，仍堅持每噸二三五鎊，目前中國桐油產量，退縮至戰前年產量之四分之一，惟在大量油產上巿後，目下之高價水準，當能望跌，近年來他方面油源之開展，已有數起。就中爲美國海灣一帶，及巴西美國境內之桐果工業，進步至爲迅速，產量已增加三倍，巴西境內之產量進度，亦至爲滿意，若所有桐樹均能全部結實，則輸往美國之數量，逆料當甚鉅大。</p>
<h3>紗市人心安定　花價繼續上漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉臻穩局，客戶納胃稍開，人心亦見安定，廿支各紗回好一二萬，惟交易仍稀。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊再漲十至廿二磅音，計近期美金三五·八〇，遠期三五。九〇，米特林現貨又創新高峯，價爲三六·四七，本埠現棉因存底日枯，市况迭昂不已，統益紗廠及常熱無錫等小型廠略有採辮，惟交易因週六關係，似較滅色，價仍漲二三千元。</p>

<h3>古都新姿</h3>
<p>— 本報十日航訊　西安記者李馳</p>
<p>古都長安，在周，秦，隋，唐，這四朝歷史上無論政治與文化，都有過光輝炫目的日子，可惜後來慢慢的衰微下去了，有時幾乎要變為山峽高原渭河盆地間一個供人憑　的遺址。但八年抗戰過程中，這古城挺立起來，像一個沒有戶口的中興，和那些「暴發戶」抗衡，它人口從不足廿萬突增至四十萬了。中原會戰後的抗戰末期，幾乎突破五十萬。去秋勝利後，居民續有東移，一度減少過幾萬人，但接着出乎意料的反而日有增加。據最新的統計，市區人口已超出五十一萬人，而且還有繼續增加的跡象。</p>
<p>古城掘窰洞　拉車幹苦力</p>
<p>形成今日的情景，大概有三個原因：在復原期間，多少原籍河北，河南，山西的老百姓，因「交通不通」而留在這裏。又有多少人，因故里不寗而不願或不敢回去。隴海鐵路東段雖還暢通，但許多河南人還是遲遲不行，尤其是黃泛區的老百姓，他們寗願繼續借這古老城牆的一角，掘個窰洞住住，男的拉車幹苦力，女的替人洗衣補縫，生活是苦了，但他們似乎仍感到滿足：「先生，說我們回老家嗎！回去吃啥幹啥？咱的田地屋子還在水底拉！黃水啊，這麼一沖……這兒還可以湊活湊活，……」</p>
<p>多少人返家　重回長安來</p>
<p>你可以為這是滑稽嗎？多少由西安跑返老家的人，今回却再跑回西安了。他們大抵因為故鄉政治變了樣，治安未復原，生活漸時無法維持，反正多年在外頭流放慣了，於是乎望地再回到西安這第二故鄉。在這裏，他們反而認為比較有辦法。下江人去了却把一家老少帶回西安的也有，理由是此間生活程度比較低易過活。還有的是有些由西便從隴海鐵路送來過的過路客，也在這裏停下來，打聽打聽，暫時裹足不前了。有這幾種人，西安人口焉能不增加？但我們必要指出，這是一種非正常的現象，是中國當前許多大問題的反映。</p>
<p>女性多於男　婦運大展開</p>
<p>在這五十一萬多居民這項新統計中，有趣的是男多於女，男的比女的多出十分之一。</p>
<p>然而，數量上不及半數的女性市民，近一兩個月來，在多方面提携獎勵之下，婦女運動正日見展開。來自各階層的女性，曾參加過一個婦運講習班，接着，在本月九日成立了全省婦女會，其間西安婦運幾位中堅分子盡了許多力。目前該會包括了五十二縣的代表，（按：陝西全省大大小小的共有九十九縣和一市），值得注意的是有些代表明明確確來自工廠和農村，她們當然不會是都市婦運的「裝飾品」，但願她們多努力，替工場和農場間的姊妹羣爭取切身的幸福。</p>
<p>新穀雖登場　麵粉却漲價</p>
<p>前面說過西安人口增多之一個原因，是此間生活程度比較低，其實這不過是相對的說法，而且這比差漸漸縮小，尤其是自從六月中旬以後。試舉麵粉一項為例：五月底，六月初，每袋還不過五六千，六月中漲至八千左右，其後繼續上揚，目下的機器麵已賣到每袋一萬二千五百元左右。這次食糧價漲中有幾點值得注意：它開始上昇的時期，並不是個「青黃不接」的月份，而恰在新麥登場的當兒。一般的說：今年渭河涇河流域的旱造收成，雖非豐稔，但平均統計，都有七八成以上的收穫量，我們沒有理由把人爲的操縱卸責於天公的不做美。有個顯明的事實，足資證明：糧價之漲是城市尤其是西安的麵粉價首先發作，經過一個短時期後，才把鄉村間的麥子價扯高了。假如說收成不好而價漲，它應該是麥子先漲才波及到麵粉成本的增加。</p>
<p>拆穿假幌子　「糧荒」不荒</p>
<p>其時，有人歸究於隴海鐵路運輸量不足，因為路局搶修陝州到洛陽之間的一段鐵路，搬運修路器材，而騰不出足量的貨車車皮，以運輸小麥入市，這是事實，但不該是引起如此重大結果的主要理由。因為市內和近鄉間無須鐵路運輸的新麥，在這時候，足供應而有餘。</p>
<p>麥子和面粉，在此時此地，決無「匱乏之憂」，應粉廠和糧行裏存貨堆滿貨棧，「新興的」小型麵粉店到處觸目皆是，一間醬油雜貨店，「擴充營業」而添幾包麵粉在門面賣，還算順眼，看到什麽小旅店，小客棧，甚至寄賣所的入門處，也堆着麵粉包來湊熱鬧，憂心「糧荒」的人安心了，所謂「糧荒」的假幌子也該拆穿了。</p>
<p>當然，糧價的波動對這五十一萬市民的生活，發生了影響，尤其是停發公糧實物以後的公　人員，他們他們所收入的鈔票和物價的起落已經沒有直接的「連鎖比例」了。不過，話得反過來說，假如以糧價爲基準而推算近半年來其他物價，就不難明白來自鄉村的顧客，在布市甚至「銀樓」裏的購買力是如何勝旺。</p>
<p>下江人亂喫　幾乎壞肚皮</p>
<p>一位來自上海的下江太太，到了西安就亂吃豬肉到幾乎壞了腸胃，她說拿上海買一斤肉的洋鈿，到西安可以買到兩斤，牛肉不過每斤六百隻洋，羊肉五百塊還不到，「便宜得來」。說到穿的呢，以二十支紗爲標準，陝產的紗，近來起伏於一百四五十萬元左右，與滬市似無多大差別。布價和棉織品價近來因東來交通日便，較諸滬市價僅多十分之二三左右，與糧價對比，顯然低落而且安定。</p>
<p>凹想糧價開始昂揚時，若干有「世道人心」的紳耆碩彥，曾奔走呼籲，他們希望這古都在他省鬧着漲風和飢饉當兒，「保留片清淨土」，可惜關中之「關」，早已變成歷史的古跡，他們的努力終歸徒然，不過托天的福，在全國諸大城市的「物價等高線」地圖上，西安還是「福地」，於是乎五十一萬市民安然住下來了。</p>

<h3>化腐朽為神奇</h3>
<p>昨日拜讀蒼龍先生特寫「垃圾不怕多，廢物好利用」一文後，不免深表同感，然覺尚未充分闡述，故將愚見，略貢於後。</p>
<p>滬市垃圾每日竟達二千噸左右，其數殊爲驚人。誠能來一個澈底而根本的清除辦法，把全市的垃圾分為五大類，（一）動物性類，（二）植物性類，（三）布條紙屑類，（四）鐵罐廢聽類，（五）煤渣泥灰類，這裏最好增設一個破碎玻璃類。如能經過這樣的切實分別之後，可以說沒有一種是多於的。如（一）（二）兩類垃圾的產量，雖特別衆多，但其用途也特別廣大，因為這種垃圾都可充作肥料的施用。若動物性之骨類，可製大量骨粉，且是肥料中最貴重的一種，因骨粉中所含的成分，在植物之營養需要最切，無論果樹作物花卉蔬菜等等，都不可缺少的基肥。在滬郊近地因無骨粉的生產，所以尚少應用，在外埠各地，骨粉是一種主要肥料。現在既有大量骨類，可以創設一個骨粉的製造廠。至於植物性的菜根之類，可為堆肥之用，也是肥料中最適合的基肥或追肥，它非但是植物的營養料，尚能促進土壤之改良。於此農村經濟困難萬分的時候，肥料缺乏的現在，更切需要。過去滬郊農民所需之肥料，多數仰給於大運荳餅的供應，自遭戰事後，運輸不便，來源缺乏，以致生產減少。今把廢物利用，堆肥二噸可抵作大荳餅一片，假說每日有堆肥千噸，則一日即可生產荳餅五百斤，全年計算竟有十八萬片之鉅。目前荳餅市價每片五千餘元，其值之鉅。已可想知，而骨粉之值也頗相當可觀。（三）（四）兩類及破碎玻璃，均能還原製造。此種出品，因原料缺乏，尤感需要。至（五）煤渣泥灰之類，亦可大有用途，即各地公路，經八年抗戰，年久失修，均遭破壞，際此復原建設之時，修築公路，是最切要的重大工作，苦無原料，像前利用日俘加緊修築，均以當地泥土暫時填補，然經天雨，依然不堪行駛，今既有此煤渣泥灰之類，竟可運往各處予以修補，以利交通。</p>
<p>由此觀之，滬市垃圾不但有一個根本的清除辦法，竟能有一舉數得之利。何樂而不為。</p>
<h3>雞鴨充塞里弄</h3>
<p>我的親戚住在一條弄堂內，他的芳鄰却是一片雞鴨行，幾十籠雞鴨，要不了一半天就售完，可是地上的餘污和餘臭從不清除，直待接到第三批雞鴨的新污新臭！從前的雞鴨行大都設在十六浦一帶江邊上，戰後一津北遷，便成今日之局，但居人稠密的弄堂內實公衆衛生有關，望當局設法幾個比較妥當些的所在，讓他們集市，免得弄堂居民有苦難宣。（石生）</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>向政府建議兩點</h3>
<p>— 陸士浩</p>
<p>（一）挽救瀕死的農村</p>
<p>在戰前，經過了種種打擊的中國農村，已經面臨着崩潰的危險。抗戰爆發後，經過兵災的地方，既受到戰爭的破壞，又遭受敵偽的壓榨，在後方，大量壯丁的微酬，龐大軍糧的供給，再加上饑饉的威脅，整個農村已經由垂危而步向死亡的途徑。</p>
<p>中國底農村，遭受到戰爭的破壞，在歷史上並沒有先例，但從沒有像今日景況的可怕。以太平天國的革命來說吧，十多年的紛擾，該是一場歷程不短的「兵災」，然而因為從前的戰爭沒有受到像這八年來日寇的高度破壞和壓榨，而未經兵災的地方，也沒有像這次戰爭付出這樣巨大的「貢獻」給國家，於是在若干時日的經過後，那些創傷在「人為的潛力」下，平復如常了。</p>
<p>但是在今日，戰前已經虛弱萬分的農村，再加上一場延綿八年的磨難，決不能再單靠那些「人為的潛力」，讓時日自然而然帶來了康復。</p>
<p>政府究竟讓這些危象聽其自然，眼看着整個農村死亡，或釀成一種「變症」呢？還是要想想辦法？</p>
<p>我們以為必須努力，拜託一切可怕底現象。這裏祗有一條路，那就是：政府要負起一切責任，把整個農村作對象，定出一個嚴密的方法和機構，來對症下藥。</p>
<p>分析一下現時農村的病症，那是：農具和種子的缺乏，資金的闙如，田賦徵實徵借的苛刻，貪官污吏上下其手的壓榨。這一連串病症的發源地祗有一個，就是：政府始終沒有一個良好的制度和機構。</p>
<p>先說農具和種子的缺乏吧，那是在一切災禍發生後的一種必然狀態。在從前，農民有力可以補購，或是借款添覆，因為賦稅沒有如今日這般苛重，他們辛苦一二年，便可以償還了，但在今日却不同。在政府，必須徵實，而他們也知道那些以三還一的什麽「借空倉米」「借油米錢」底債務，是一種飲鴆止渴的辦法，他們於是放棄耕種，逃荒到都市，流於求乞度日。</p>
<p>中國的國家銀行，每年都舉辦農貸。但是這些銀行要抵押品，他們不相信那些渴望着「資金」來週轉的真正農民，於是這一批資金全數落在農村的特殊階級手裏。這些特殊階級本是剝削農民的老手，現在他們以低利借到一筆資金，徒然使他們反而增加了一筆剝削的本錢。這樣，農村社會階層中，坐享其利者越富，而胼手砥足者越窮了？</p>
<p>其次，苛政之猛如虎，實是最致命傷。不問收穫的多少，而來一個每畝徵實四斗，再加上徵借和軍糧搜購，那將是一種使農村死亡的催命符。中國永遠是一個沒有統計底國家，政府不知道每一省每一縣究竟有多少畝田地，有多少出產，軍糧要供給多少，怎樣在荒年解決和補救。他們不知道那一個地方可能還有多少餘糧，爲了軍糧的供應，便來一陣狂風似的徵購，一陣過了又來一陣，種田的人沒米吃了，而徵價的不公允，使他們連得買別樣代用品來將究一下肚皮也不可辨到。</p>
<p>在這種黑暗而無秩序的制度下，一批貪官污吏發財了，而幾年勞苦的農民却更苦不堪言！</p>
<p>因此，我們願建議一下對症下藥：</p>
<p>首先調整的，應是地主和種戶間收益率。目下農村中田主與種戶間的「分益率」約為四六折，或六四折，或對折。即地主收益爲收成額之四成或六成或半數。這樣「不勞而獲」的收益下，地主投資的利息實在太高了，這種畸形底現狀，我們應該首先加以改革。</p>
<p>我們試探就一種新的分配率，那就是：耕作者，50%；政府，35%；田主，15%。這般的分配率，地主是吃虧的。但是我們根據「耕者有其田」的原理下，政府收買土地分配與農民的政策是一定要實行的。然以中國政府經濟這般窘迫，究竟在什麽時候才能實行呢？如果政府強行收買，而以公債付之於田主，則中國社會階層可能引起騷動，因為中國不同於別的國家，大多數的土地集中於少數人手裏，而是分散於無數的「小資產階級」手裏，強行收買而不付以現金，可能使大多數人經濟起了激烈的影響，而帶來種種的騷動。因此祗有這個辦法，一方面壓低了地主的收益而解除耕作者一部份的痛苦，一方面使土地集中的趨勢緩和，減少對農村土地投資的興趣，而達到耕者有其田的目的。</p>
<p>現時農村還有一種必需剷除的弊病，那就是「包佃者」的尽間取利。許多人士向地執有者，獲取了相當土地的永佃權後，自己不從事耕種，而轉租於種戶，於是種戶在向地主的納租外，還需問「包佃者」獻出一部份收成。這實是一種最要不得的現象。所以我們要使佃戶與種戶合併爲一，即使永佃權祗限定於一個規定的數目內，超越了這個數目的永佃權，應由地主收回，而付之於最近數年來的實際耕種者。</p>
<p>同時爲了使耕種者變成實際的自耕農，政府可以規定一條法规，那就是在「新耕種法」頒行後，種戶如果已經獲得了耕種權五年後，得隨時向地主購買其土地，價格以五年來地主收盆底總和爲標準。其方式如下：</p>
<p>（五年內收成數×地主收益）×米價＝地價</p>
<p>假定五年內每畝總收益爲五石，所在地米價在購買時爲五萬元乙石則</p>
<p>（5石×15%）×50000＝〇.75石×50000＝3700元</p>
<p>這樣的法規，使非耕種者不敢再從事投資於農村土地，也可以避免地主一時賭氣而不出賣其土地。在地主方面，等於先收五年的利益，亦樂於出售，但地價以一次交繳為宜，以免地主經濟得被分裂。</p>
<p>這樣的分配率，政府在一年兩熟的耕地，以對主要耕作物徵收一次爲標準，一年三熟的地方則酌加一個低率的徵收。</p>
<p>在戰前，田賦不過五升至一斗，如果照目下的征收率，那末在豐年時，上則田每畝至高可收成至一石二斗，則政府之35%收成，已達四斗餘，不可謂之不厚。故政府在這種高率徵收下，應該竭力扶助農民，一方面使農民收入增加，政府亦隨之收入加高，相互得益。</p>
<p>現在試爲政府訂下一個新農糧機構，以適應此新的法規和環境：</p>
<p>農糧部－省農糧管理處－</p>
<p>農作物研究所</p>
<p>肥料製造廠</p>
<p>農具製造廠</p>
<p>耕地擴展委員會</p>
<p>倉賦管理處（縣）</p>
<p>農業督導所（區）</p>
<p>運輸局</p>
<p>調節委員會</p>
<p>把農村和糧食部合併爲一，可以使機構緊縮，工作便利。（農業部一部份漁收的工作，可以成立一個漁收部，來適應中國底需要。）將來工作的負責者是省，省以下的機構，確實地負起改進農村的一切。</p>
<p>現時中國的農村還用得着古式農具，和以糞便爲肥料，使收獲數量減低。因此農作物研究所，要負起種子改良和耕耘方式之改進責任，同時農具肥料兩製造廠，其出品最好以無代價分配與農民，或採貼補式的出售，並分期付欵而不需利息。</p>
<p>將來最重要的部份，是農業督導所，它要負責直接對農民耕作指導和監督，由縣以上之區爲單位，直接向省負責。所以要向省直接負責者，就是因為中國許多機構，多一層便多一些剝削。將來農具肥料或種子的分配，都由督導所實施，如果在區以上的縣多設一層組織，可能發生了剝削的弊端。</p>
<p>因為必須徵實，所以設縣倉賦管理處，平時管理田賦，在徵收時則負保管糧食的責任。</p>
<p>現時許多人在反對徵實制度，說它過於苛擾。但我們以為橫豎政府終要收買軍糧，那末與其狂風似的機構，還是希望政府以徵實來應付軍隊的需要。目下田賦收入，既為地方七成，中央三成，那末軍糧在徵實內發購，不過爲政府間的「劃賑交易」，不致苛擾民衆。</p>
<p>徵實所需改革的，是運送與度量衡器的更改。在過去，徵收的糧，每每令人民送達數百里外，而沿途苛擾和收糧人員的留難，使民衆感到痛苦萬分，遂使徵實被詬爲苛政。爲了避免這些弊病，由縣建設糧倉，徵收的米糧由人民解繳收藏，而把調節和運送，付於調節委員會及運輸局。同時對於度量衡之器具，應數加訂定，以免弊端由此而生。</p>
<p>這樣辨理，政府，地主，和農民之間變成不是繳征賦稅的關係，而是共同投資的團體，農民是以勞力爲資本者，政府則負調理度支一切重則，故兩者收入較多，地主好比投資不管事的東家，祗得坐收較少的紅利。</p>
<p>通過這機構，政府可以知道年內收穫的總數，因而通盤計　，對於荒年怎樣補救，豐年怎樣維持，同時利用區農業督導所的報告，更可以直接對耕農貸金，並詳悉地區內之土質，而令農民適宜地投資於某一種耕作物，農隙生產之擴張及指導，亦均能有所根據而實際進行。</p>
<p>對於在農民手中的米糧，我們不贊成統制，可許民間自由買賣。惟爲便於調節起見，可以縣爲單位，組織合作社，一切該縣區內的米糧，均經由合作社經手，略取佣金，以貼補於合作社供給之手工業出品上，使農民於購買時獲得公允而平價之供給。這樣，一縣內的存糧數目，詳細知悉，不致發生迫購軍糧的慘狀了。</p>
<p>以上所說，以米糧爲準，然可類推之於其他出品。</p>
<p>政府最後而又最大的責任，是維持耕作物與手工業產品之交換率（詳下章），使米價不致有時則與手工業產品互相刺激而漲價，或殼賤傷農，豐年大跌價之虞。</p>
<p>我們希望政府正視現實，尤其在共黨強力重行分配土地的時候，必須對比計劃，加以考慮和實行，並要求在執行時，隨時要斬決那些非「投資者」所伸出來的「舞弊之手」！</p>
<p>（二）從「中紡」盈餘看工業</p>
<p>跟隨着農村死亡的步伐，中國底工業也走臨到崩潰的邊沿。大量外貨的湧到，在價廉物美的條件下，再加上中國人崇拜洋貨的狂熱，這種危機，如果不設法預防的話，我們可以斷言，資本家和工人決不能快樂地度過這勝利後的第二個新年了！</p>
<p>六月八日立法院第三〇一次會議，新任經濟部長王雲五，曾對於中國紡織建設公司數月來的盈餘有所報告，說「中紡」在四月份盈餘九十億元，五月份盈餘一百四十億元，今後可能逐漸增加。這個龐大的盈餘數目，是用怎樣方式得來的呢？王氏並沒有說明，他不過以這些數目字來答覆一部份委員的「焦慮」而已。「中紡」在開始到現在，一直受着「舉民爭利」，「官僚資本」，「領導漲價」等等的責難，雖然許多人在替政府辯白它的苦心和漲價的不確，但這些盈餘，正暴露了它一部份的弱點和顯示出一條工業新生的途徑。</p>
<p>許多人責怪「中紡」在領導漲價，這是不對的。我們可以斷定的說，以「中紡」交給民營，無論如何，決沒有這麼多的盈利得。我們應當知道「中紡」正利用它國營的優越條件，得到許多使成本減輕的機會。在某一個時期，中紡如果不漲價，可能使那些民營工廠，在無可競爭的形勢下全部不支而關門的。爲了這種理由，再加上想以盈餘來彌補國庫，便不得不扛上「領導漲價」罪名底譴責。</p>
<p>但是「中紡」的盈餘，用來彌補財政的不平衡，是無濟於事的。相反的，以中紡的「優待」交給民營而且擴大之，而以物價的壓低，收縮生活程度的高漲，則可收制止通貨膨脹和挽救工業危機的雙重收穫。</p>
<p>現時，黑市價格的煤斤，與燃料委員會供給的煤斤，價格相差頗巨。但目下煤斤的供應已足維持，爲什麽不以「官價」煤斤供給一般工廠呢？因此，我們提議將一切政府可能平價供給的工廠需用品，分配與各工廠，對於仰求於外洋者，則由政府以較低外滙結價，以求成本的減低。</p>
<p>爲了一切都集中力量來鬥爭，和避免商人暴力起見，我們建議政府劃分全國爲幾個工業區，強令區內各工廠合併，使成為一個從前日本人所說：「滙然一體」的機構，至低限度也應該要各廠間成立一個共同採購原料及分配市場的「組織」，以求力量的集中發揮和避免國內廠商的互相傾軋。</p>
<p>這樣的計劃，日本在台灣和華北便實行過，以其全力去爭取一個目標。但是我們並不需要學日本「殖民地」式的壓榨，也並不是叫資本家組成「托辣斯」或「辛迪加」的集團，「殖民地」式的壓榨，是犧牲他人血汗來築就帝國主義的基礎，資本家的「托辣斯」和「辛迪加」是壟斷的集團，我們可以由政府監視工業出品的成本，強力執行限價政策並嚴懲壟斷份子。這樣，政府和資本家都沒有吃虧，資本家固然不能得到暴利，但危機是沒有了；政府在貼補上好像損失了，但物價的低落等於通貨的收縮，而最大的收穫却是民衆，他們將不再嚐到物價飛漲的痛苦。政府何樂而不為？</p>
<p>政府在執行「限價」的時候，應當公允地規定一個工業製成品與農村耕作物的交互率，許多工業的原料都與農村耕作物有關；規定了兩種作物的交換率，一方面可以使農村經濟安定，一方面避免價格有時互相刺激而高漲。以麵粉為例，最近因爲米價的報漲，都市的麵粉商便適量隨之提高售價，但事實上麵粉的原料－麥，在農村並未漲價。等到麵粉一漲，麥價也就水漲船高，來一次不必要的漲價了。這是政府對工業管理的弛張所致。在嚴密監視工廠的成本並規定工業與農業產品的交換率時，可以避免這種弊病。</p>
<p>許多人嚷着要縮短滙率，以挽救危亡的工業。但是如果政府不能控制工業和出產時，驟然使外滙漲價是有害無益的。在中國人心中，已普遍形成了一種「輕視國幣」的心理，而且許多工業都與外滙有關，一旦提高外滙價格，外貨的成本是增加了，但各物隨之而漲，民衆未受其益，反先受其害了。至於提高關稅，限制進口，也非抑制外貨的基本對策。祗有這麼的一條路儘量以國內的供應品低價給與工廠，以低價外滙結與廠商採購原料，以合併而成的工業機構適應目下的環境，以嚴密監視避免暴力的實現，然後在這些條件有相當成效時，提高外滙的價格。</p>
<p>這種策略是不是適宜長久施於中國呢？那還需看將來情形而決定，但為提高投資者的興趣，在情形許可下，可以使資本家有較高的盈餘（但以不傷害國民經濟爲原則），而規定那些盈餘必須投資於新工業之產生。</p>
<p>有人懷疑，政府能不能在經濟上負起這個重則呢？那是沒有辦法解釋的。不過，以中國目下的經濟情況來說，任何一件事業都不能舉辦！其勢已到了窮則變的時候了。這好有一比：好比一個入不敷出者，如果要購辦那一件需用品，如果多方盤算，遲疑不決的話，那末，他將不能購得任何物品歸為己有。祗有一個辦法，那就是覺得那件東西是真正必需時，趕快就買，以既成事實來迫令自己設法。中國要舉辦一件事情，在經濟發生懷疑時，這是一個最好的例子。</p>

<h3>白與黑</h3>
<p>— 任予</p>
<p>我熱愛白。</p>
<p>我喜歡白的顏色，因為它是代表純潔和清白。</p>
<p>雪底美，因為它全身潔白得晶瑩可愛。棉底美，因為它純潔得毫無污點，還包藏着無限的溫暖。</p>
<p>我愛白燕，我愛牠底潔白的羽毛，和那一隻自由飛翔的白翅膀。當我望見牠在空中飛行的時候，我高興得像一個久困於車載斗量地獄的囚徒忽然看見了陽光，感到了莫大的熱慰。</p>
<p>我愛白衣女郎，我愛她底白色的衣裳在空中飄盪。我看見了她，我立刻用我底靈魂去擁抱她。我撫摸她底白色的衣裳，吻着她底白的肌膚，握着她底白的臂膀，還細細地欣賞她底潔白整齊的牙齒……</p>
<p>在下着大雪的日子裏，我穿白衣走出門去，我赤着脚讓我底肌膚去吻着大地，在白茫茫的原野上，我留下一個個的脚跡。我穿過了披上白衣裳的森林，我又爬上戴了白帽子的山崗，我望見一片白的平原，和許多蓋着一層白幕的屋子。啊，我興奮到發狂了，我驕傲着我佔有了白色的天地。</p>
<p>我憎惡黑。</p>
<p>我深深地憎惡黑的顏色，因為它蘊藏着災難，卑鄙和污穢。</p>
<p>我憎惡烏鴉底黑色的羽毛，和牠站在屋　叫着「呀呀」的惹人討厭的聲音。牠象徵着車載黑暗，牠帶給人們以災難。牠是醜惡的朋友，是善良的敵人。</p>
<p>我憎恨那站在門口「汪汪……」地吠着的黑狗。牠時常向一些對培訓并無惡意的過路人示威，培訓欺侮天眞活潑的小陔，牠咀咒夜半飄來的雄亮的歌聲，還狂吠那在底下富有詩意的搖動着的樹影。可買來的黑狗，牠對一切美好的都深懷知音。只有，在牠主人面前，才卑鄙地拖長舌頭搖擺着尾巴，以討好主子的歡喜。</p>
<p>我討厭那躺在泥濘裏的黑豬。牠永遠不離污穢，牠是污穢的朋友。牠專門在骯髒的垃圾堆裏找尋食料。牠全身包含了無數的污穢種子。我龐大牠底愚蠢。懶惰的性格，討厭那副自以為「漂亮」的尊容，和牠底烏黑的顏色。</p>
<p>我憎惡黑旗，黑衣，黑雲，……和世界上一切黑的顏色。</p>
<p>我克期痛恨那些專門將白的東西染成黑色的染工。他們是製程黑暗的能手。白的衣裳，白的手套，白的襪子，白的布疋……一切潔白的東西，經過他們的手都變成黑色。他們那雙可怕的黑手，眞是値得咀咒。</p>
<p>還好，世界上還有漂白粉的存在。它為所有愛好白的人服務，把任何染有污點的東西都洗刷得乾乾淨淨。</p>
<p>我熱愛白，我將永遠擁抱白。</p>
<p>我憎惡黑，我將以智慧的鋤頭埋葬了黑。</p>
<h3>晨</h3>
<p>— 王琦刻</p>
<h3>蒼老</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>不知為着什麼，近來，時常興起一種感覺：自己是蒼老了。</p>
<p>從外表上看來我的頭發依然柔黑如漆，我不出一根花白；在額角上，「飽嚐憂患的皺紋」也沒有增添，找不出一根花如昔日的齊整，手足的活動，也還沒有絲毫的僵硬，……從這一切，都還盡量遺留着年靑的氣息，蒼老在什麼地方呢？</p>
<p>但是，我的確學到自己是蒼老了，——蒼老的暗影生長在心靈深處。</p>
<p>我不能估計我現在的心靈有多少沉重，（當然要比以前重得多了）但是我卻能察出它蒼老底痕跡，撫摩出它上面凸凹不平的瘡疤來。在不久前，我的心靈還像一片剛切開的鐵塊，斷面上閃爍着像電火一般的光彩，照徹着別人的心靈；然而，經過一年來風雨的飄灑，鐵塊的斷面上蒙上了一攤攤的銹斑，人們對它在開始感到陌生，就是鐵塊本身，也失去令人眩目的光彩了。</p>
<p>我現在的心情，正像一個牧羊人趕着　羊，踏上歸途的時候，那般的冷清，寂寞。</p>
<p>在整整的一年前，我踏出了大學的門檻，為了情勢所迫，我不得不像一頭小牛，在滾滾的人海裏來回奔跑。</p>
<p>如果世上人們的遭遇可以分為幸運與來去，那末我大槪可以說是屬於前者了，我並未用我的全力，就找到一個職業，在這個環境裏，我看到了投機，取巧，遊樂，安逸。金錢就是靈魂，享受高於一切。我那稚弱的，天眞的心靈開始受着一種禮禮，一種夸張的，虛偽的，總之是不幸的熏陶；我感到我的心情已經沒有以前年輕了。勝利的號聲響徹了天地，我除了本來的職務外，同時我開始在一家報範當新聞記者，後來又改為副刊的編輯，在這時候，我又看到了派與派的門爭，人與人的傾軋，沒有情感，只有利用；沒有禮讓，祇講手段！雖然我幹了僅僅一個很短的時期，但是我已經看得很夠了，我不想再着下去。我們着自己的心靈，感到一種惋惜，因為它又蒼老一些了。不久，我就離開上海，到了一個公家的機關去，並且協助接收的工作。在這裏，重重的公文把一些朝氣都趕跑了，只講手續，不講效率的風氣，把我的氣質也給改變了許多。我變得把穩，持重，膽小，沉默，而且不惜也學會了一些敷愆的功夫。異黑又紅，但是，八個月來歲月的輾策，給我心情的最大波動，恐怕是憂傷於心靈底蒼老罷。</p>
<p>每一次回到上海來，朋友們拍着我的臂膀，說我「老練」得多了。我所能夠回答他們的，不過是一個無言的苦笑。</p>
<p>「老練」嗎？還不是「心的　老」的代名詞而已！</p>
<p>蒼老了，蒼老了!我駝着這一身的衰老，足步的展開，也顯得龍鍾。我瞻望前途，覺有一種嘲笑底難堪。</p>
<p>我眞的已衰老了嗎？</p>
<p>在某一個子夜，我默默地數着過去的歲月：一年，二年……天呵：我還祇有二十五歲！</p>
<h3>生命·音樂·眼淚</h3>
<p>— 淑文</p>
<p>——短憶之一</p>
<p>一個眞正能用全部生命去愛音樂的人，才能在音樂裏真眞感受到生命的存在。</p>
<p>我曾經看到一個學琴的女孩子，當她與鋼琴分享了兩個月，再坐到鋼琴前，彈起兩個月前的練習，發現自己技術的生疏退步時，她痛苦的流淚了。</p>
<p>當我看到那晶亮的淚珠，在一雙充滿着智憲光彩的的大眼睛裏淚動，最後終於遏制不住，而跌落到琴鍵上時，我彷彿諦聽到淚珠在那發光的琴鍵上，激起了一種雖則輕微，但可以使靈魂抖動的聲音。</p>
<p>「一顆美麗的金鋼鑽，人們可以從裏面看出人間的一切苦樂來。」當眼淚與音樂的精靈溶化在一起的時候，音樂因眼淚而光彩，眼淚因音樂而飛翔了。</p>
<p>我愛那眞正能用全生命去愛愛音樂的人，因為她是眞正懂得生命的人。</p>

<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 景行</p>
<p>給一個不明生死的朋友</p>
<p>記否八年前，月夜底黃浦江畔，妳倚着江邊的鐵欄，明黑底雙眸注視着二三艘小小的商輪，亮着淡淡底燈光，照見夜潮在泛漲，妳望着流水出神了，我站在一邊輕輕地撫摩着妳的肩。</p>
<p>記否五年前，敵人的鐵蹄踏進東南半壁，抗戰的呼聲達於高潮底時節，我和你懷着一顆脆弱底心，從那些瘋狂底海盜的大屠殺中逃出，在湘北底古老的原野上停留下來了，我們整天地聽着關於戰爭的消息，妳忙於問一批批後觀察家的難民們打聽故鄉的狀況，我忙着寫一封封的信，遍托了朋友找尋職業，妳是那麼的憔悴而我又是多麼的消瘦啊：</p>
<p>記否三年前，脫了班的成渝車在黑夜裏登上渡船，把我們載過沱江，夜是陰霾的，沱江在陰霾中便更顯得黑　　地不知邊際了，對岸微弱的火光和天際的星星相閃耀，我們彼此依稀看到臉上的笑意，直到我們的足跡印上那個名叫稗木的小鎭上，彷彿在電石燈底照耀下，妳是帶着欣喜的情緒的，我高興地剝開最後一只廣柑，把一半分給了你。</p>
<p>記否一年前，晨曦透上山頂，初夏底公園裏有輕聲底雀語啁瞅於樹際，清晨的涼風刮過我倆的身旁，妳底鬢髮給吹散了，我悄悄地為妳掠起，在清晨底空氣下山城是屬於寂寞的。於是我們在寂寞中擁抱了。</p>
<p>在那些漫長的日子中，我們相依為命地踏遍了國土的一半，前綫的砲火，後方的被炸，一切都不會分去了我們相愛的心，我們將永遠地在一起生活！妳說，我也說過，雖然當勝利的消息傳出，為了家鄉的衰老底雙親，我答應了妳一個人獨自歸鄉的建議，因為我知道，自己所服務的機關在三個月中也將東遷的！如果當時我便能悟到我們將從此永不相聚，那我又怎會讓妳孤單單地走了的呢。</p>
<p>妳去了半年多，沒有音信，我們的機關也因交通的關係而滯留在這裏，半年中我一直在忙於打聽妳的消息，有人說在漢口遇到過你，有人說在京滬路的快車中好似見過妳一面，但他們都不能十分肯定，我惶惑地寫了一封又一封的快信到妳底家裏，而回答我的卻永遠是妳衰老的雙親所寫底：「尚未返家」這四個大字。</p>
<p>憂急，失望，惶惑，苦悶，把我造成一個完全悲觀的人了，我辭去了我的職務，整天徘徊在輪船公司的門口。希望在千萬個還鄉的同胞中，有一天也會攤到了我。讓我趕回到渴別十年底家鄉，看一看事實底究竟，雖然我很明白，長江水勢湍急，假使果眞妳還沒有到家的話，我相信，妳也許是葬身於激流底漩渦裏去</p>
<p>願上帝祝福你平安着吧！在我還沒有來得及趕回故鄉來見你的時候。一九四六，六，二五。</p>
<h3>眼淚</h3>
<p>— 謀</p>
<p>憤怒，　悶，鑄成了沉默，鑄成了倔強。</p>
<p>倔強才會迸住眼淚，不肯輕易的流落。痛苦，會咬緊牙根，重重的壓迫，會拚着心力去承受</p>
<p>滔滔的江流；多麼浩蕩，多麼雄壯，又是那麼的溫柔和舒暢。但是，可不能把它獲塞，看，它憤怒，它嚗哮，整個世界都翻動了。</p>
<p>人類的情感，正是一樣。</p>
<p>能夠恣情的笑，這是幸福；能夠恣情的哭，這，也是幸福。</p>
<p>矯節的笑，阻遏了的眼淚——這些，都是痛苦的痛苦。</p>
<p>世界上的事情，不一定都是順利的；每個人的心情，更往往容易被誤解，流淚不能幫助你解決這些，但是隨着眼淚的洗濯，可能把心情理得更坦白和自慰。</p>
<p>假使，連這一點基本的權利都被剝削了，那沉靜的外表，蘊藏的是多複雜多危險的情感啊。</p>
<p>歲月悠悠。</p>
<p>幼年是値得回味和追念的。</p>
<p>也不知從什麼時候起，一半好像是人家好意的抬舉，一半好像是自己的渴慕。漸漸的成了成年了。</p>
<p>是的，渴慕。</p>
<p>看大人們歡笑，看大人們宴會酬酢娛樂，誰又不怦然心動，但誰又知道這只是糖衣的苦藥。</p>
<p>幼年，隨自己笑，隨自己哭；現在呢……</p>
<p>沒有失去的時候，就不會知道獲得的可貴。</p>
<p>平淡的事物，時過境遷，往往會變得高不可攀。人生是戲劇，從局外看局中人，也許會拍案嘲笑，但自己置身局中，又安能不遭同樣的命運？</p>
<p>能恣情的流淚，是幸福。</p>
<p>幸福的人們，願祝福你們！</p>
<h3>火</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>火，生命的象徵，誰不懷着喜悅迎它。</p>
<p>即使是一小點，星星的，它也有熱，也有光，它也會變成熊熊的火炬，它也會多少的溫暖這世界。</p>
<p>世界在它，是多麼的渺小，恁是再多的藏垢納污，卑鄙齷齪，它也能容，它也能潔凈。</p>
<p>假使世界上沒有火，誰又能想像這是一幅怎樣陰暗的圖畫。</p>
<p>當力量壓迫它時，它會潛伏，它會隱忍，但是除非它整個生命的結果，它依然會奮起全生命的力，織成美麗燦爛的圖案。</p>
<p>火，我們祖先曾經膜拜過，這，生命的象徵。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（九一）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>麗華送他們去後，回到屋裏，佇立窗前，用淚眼凝眸着那一又銀色大地上蹣跚歸去的影子。她隱約地感到，她也神往地被他們帶走了她的心靈·</p>
<p>張弦又回到屋裏，悄悄地站在麗華的背後，冷笑地說：</p>
<p>「走遠了，我的墨老板！我勸您也別太一見傾心了吧！」</p>
<p>麗華忿然一轉身，張了張嘴，想說什麼又嚥下去了。</p>
<p>「師父，您就少說兩句吧，何苦來，要逗的她生氣哩？」墨太太也有些看不慣了，向張弦勸吿地說。</p>
<p>「誰逗她來着？別人叫她應酬，她罵別人是逼她下流如今她自己深更半夜把客人往家裏勾搭；而且不容第三者在旁邊，這就是上流了！哼！「只興州官放火，不許百姓點燈」。」張弦叨叨地說，把瓜皮帽往頭頂一推，充分露出了一種無賴的神氣。</p>
<p>「人家是學校的教員，人家是第一次到家裏來，一非為認乾女兒；二不是為交朋友；人家好意來看看我，這也算是「應酬」嗎？你說，你有什麼理由對我的客人，那樣不禮貌？你又是我的什麼人？」麗華簡直惱了，她吵着，拍着桌子。她很少這樣地發脾氣。</p>
<p>「我是你的師父！我就有理由對那些不三不四的人不禮貌。」張弦也不示弱地嚷着。</p>
<p>「師父只能管徒弟藝術上的事，私人行動上的事，管不着！再說，我現在已經早沒有跟你學戲了。」麗華大聲地說。</p>
<p>「好了！好了！大家少說一句。」墨太太一而勸着，一面把張弦往外推。</p>
<p>「管不着我也要管！」張弦一邊走，一邊還嘟嚨地說着。</p>

<h3>奴隸的結合</h3>
<p>— 萬流</p>
<p>讀「山城故事」</p>
<p>奴隸，是魔鬼手下良善的人！</p>
<p>善良的人，才是魔鬼的奴隸！</p>
<p>奸詐·卑鄙·無恥的小人，不是魔鬼的奴隸，而是魔鬼的走狗！</p>
<p>狗，是一條夾着尾巴過街的狗！</p>
<p>「山城故事」里的人物不是捏造的理想的，或者是空幻的，似乎了沒有用過渲染製造，或者其他一些高超的筆法，而是一　活生生的，有血有肉的眞實社會里我們朝夕相共的親友。</p>
<p>所以當我們看這劇的時候，並不是熱息奔騰，呼吸屏息……這許多有行使的反應，而是一種靈魂深遠的相息，一種生命底的同情，一種人類天性的憐憫；你歡愉，你悲痛，彷彿你自己也在遭遇着同樣的奴隸們的命運。</p>
<p>這是個奇異而微妙的發現。</p>
<p>因為這樣，它的故事並不能刺激你，而那一　悲慘命運的奴隸們的影象，卻很難讓你淡忘。</p>
<p>「山城故事」是一首人性的詩，是一篇美麗的樂章，是一幅淡的素描。</p>
<p>他是片斷的，瑣碎事件之絮訴，他是不連續的人類生命之嘆息。</p>
<p>我們要在他的片斷中看他的整體，我們要在他的不連續中，尋他的連續。</p>
<p>它的表現方法是側面的，是隱藏的，是暗示的；而我們欣賞的道路也該是在平淡中求深奧，在簡單中尋複雜，在黑暗中尋光明。</p>
<p>不求直覺的感應，但求深遠的體意，不求一時的激奮，但求悠久的回味。</p>
<p>這一對可憐的奴隸，一個死去，一個孤獨。</p>
<p>人類的悲劇：也就是奴隸們的悲劇。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>封面女郎</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>請教女士，大可改造。　看片以前，先改目標。</p>
<p>這部片子據說是麗泰海華斯在銀幕上轉變作風的第一部「豪華作」其實這部片子就是一個「華」字；至於「豪」字，嚴格的說起來似乎不夠，祇可在廣吿上吹吹牛。</p>
<p>故事簡單得很，以名利與情愛的鬥爭為主題，襯托歌舞色彩的塲面，在表面上好像是說女主角的傾向名利之途是不對的，而在看完戲以後回想起來，那女主角的出走豈不是一個最好的方法，不但名利雙收，而且在愛情上仍沒有什麼損傷，類如這種離合的故事在彩片上可以說多得很，「封面女郎」也沒有什麼特出。</p>
<p>片子的開塲不壞，一個一個女人推出舞台表演；先長袍，後短衣，尚算新穎，奇尼凱萊在後台頻頻搖頭的特寫可算是好的鏡頭。不過介紹他的出塲似乎欠夠，即是封面女郎麗泰海華絲的出塲也犯了他同樣的毛病，欠「突出」。</p>
<p>導演把許多鏡頭都放在「時裝表演」式，無論在那兒祇要一有機會，他就找一個地位，將鏡頭對準了一個女人，定住地攝上幾秒鍾，其給人的感覺好像她們全是身穿時裝的模特兒，所以全片中女角的服裝費可說沒有白化，因為導演不嫌其煩的把它運用了。「封面女郎」以時裝表演式為取鏡頭手法的主題，不過其所採取的方式也有「巧妙」，「惡劣」之分：譬如說那位主考封面女郎的夫人，而導演也常常拿她當作模特兒而攝取她的靜照，這便是導演欠聰明的所在。按劇情該角色是可以予以誇大。造成了她易於給人發現的特性，自可增強不少的戲劇效果，至於要誇張這位女士的方法，我認為最普通的就有兩條路可走：（一）把她造成「東施」型的女子，走路行動完全「鏡頭表情」化，（二）把她造成一個指示旁人衣着的「专家」，每见到人就批评对方的服装与化装，这一条路当然是更需要编剧共同负责的。</p>
<p>「封面女郎」最大的缺点就是整个戏中没有一个人是突出的，另女主角都平凡，勉强的说起来：那个滑稽的傢伙还能說是四分之一的「突出人物」。</p>
<p>因為故事平凡，人物平凡，所以戲大部份便在平凡中演出着，使院於中的觀眾在十份之中祇感覺到一份的興奮，以後又是九份的平凡，一份的興奮，……興奮劑拍離太遠，就是促成這部戲不能稱為「成功作」的一個很大的原因。</p>
<p>全劇中最好的一塲是奇尼凱萊失意時的形與影，也就是這部片給予我僅有的「突出」點了，形與影先後在街上跳舞，描寫出內心的衝突極好，當看完這部戲以後祇有這一點我覺得是導演在全片中利用戲劇技巧最多的地方，也是留給我印象最深的地方。</p>
<p>相對的，奇尼凱萊抱着衣架子獨舞的塲面，可說是糟透，完全與他本身在「萬眾歡騰」中一樣（假使此片拍攝在先，「萬眾歡騰」在後，則其罪可以減輕一等），且整個的步驟及使觀眾感覺到的韻律，還沒有「萬眾歡騰」好，為什麼同是奇尼凱萊，要在兩部片子中演着抄襲的戲呢？</p>
<p>「一人三形」！左邊是一個小的全身，右邊是一個頭部的特寫，再接下便將頭部的特寫抽去換上雜誌封面的交代——也可說是一個特出的地方，但是這個成就不及前者的大，因為依據他攝影手法主題，他是應該可攝這一類的鏡頭，沒有什麼特異。所以我說：「一人三形」祇是應該要有的好鏡頭，手法也不見得新穎，導演很容易想得出來，不是別出的心裁。其理由正好像我們京戲中演「四郞探母」中弔毛弔得好是唱生的應該有的好動作一樣。</p>
<p>兩次老頭的回憶是好的，襯托出最後第三次婚禮回憶及唆使也是好的，戲如果在此結束，或者加上旁的寫法便好了，如今該片是另的唱歌歌女的回來，同聲合唱同跳而終那簡直太平凡，太俗套，與小孩子不會寫文章的時候用「人生於世」開篇一樣，挺多包給人家不同是人家是女的唱歌，男的回來，而他則為男的唱歌，女的回來，但這究竟是換湯勿換藥，有什麼意味呢？</p>
<p>演員方面，奇尼凱萊最好，大槪七十幾分而已，豐泰海華絲似不夠抓住個性，演醉的一塲尚佳，歌舞則未見特出，演滑稽的斐爾比「一千〇一夜」中好，也不過是平平，試想我們如將此角改為雷克奧凱或史都路文如何？如此便可知道斐爾演戲的噩了。李寶文「架子」不壞，戲也可以，前途有望。</p>
<p>色彩有幾塲是好的，大槪是屬於有紅色的幾塲，當然紅色易於吸引人的原因很大。統盤而論，色彩還不壞。</p>
<p>如果我們把這部片子認為是女子服裝及化粧上的介紹，那麼它便是一部成功的片子，假使你認為它是一部「賣色賣藝」的電影，那這一部片子便是失敗了。我寫了這些話，便是想吿訴讀者，如果你沒有看過這部片子而正想去看，那你千萬將目標移到時裝表演上去，那你一定會有很滿意的收穫。</p>

<h3>演技中的形式派　（續）</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>樣式化的原則，要求設定一個劇本和各幕中主要的，根本的東西。演出者為了把劇本最基本的東西提出，以濃厚的色彩作對照，將形式簡略成圖式化。一般人稱他的劇塲為神秘的劇塲。他所招來的畫家，便將舞台看做表示自己的色彩構圖的額緣，把演員推在背後，由主要的美術家和畫家來表現戲劇的企圖。而且為了製造一定的氣氛，以最大限度的利用照明。</p>
<p>條件性的演劇起始雖然是平面的，繪畫式的，但後來漸趨於立體裝置，提出了建築的構成代替繪畫的裝飾，一切必須是彫刻性的，繪畫的曖昧必須推到佈景後面去，這表現了向構成主義演劇的移動。在「勃提斯姊姊」的演出中，演員不是現身在平面裝飾的佈景內，而是在圓形之內，用和諧的說白，及顯明正確的彫刻化的姿態。這種彫刻化的方法，是把演員帶到空塲。在安特烈夫的「人之一生一排演時，完全不用裝飾，企圖廢除裝飾及演員脫離背景之羈絆的表示。確定演員的軀體及四肢的輪廓條件以及顏面的一切動作與聲音高低抑揚的意義，以令其有高尚的表情，這便是演劇動力學的出發點。觀眾座四周的墻壁覆上灰色的布幕，光的來源只有一個，陳設的設計是極為誇張的，演員的化裝簡直和面具一樣，　髯好像是彫成的。其所以如此乃在於傳達夢的傷感與感情。這時梅耶荷德忽然又想起了演員利用高度不同的舞台階梯表現，無疑的他覺得運用階梯可以發展他企圖使演員脫離平面佈景之彫刻化的方法。並且他用盡巧技去統一演員與觀眾，他把演員帶到圍裙式的舞台上，絲毫畢現於觀眾眼前，他廢除了舞台前部及重幕，他用燈光照耀演員，使他們好像彫刻一樣清楚。　老是不斷的試騐，最後差不多使演劇變成了傀儡。總之，這時期他大槪受了神秘主義，象徵主義的影響，因此躲避在與現實隔離的純藝術裏去，這種藝術創造是神秘的，厭世的，抽象的，象徵主義的，以美學的經過洗練的形式主義來創造的。他深信演員在舞台上的應成為詩人思想的一種看得見的象徵的，他尋找舞台上的程式化，於是他向意大利「即興喜劇」，東方與中古時代劇塲，傀儡戲與希臘劇中，搜尋憂惑。</p>
<p>當蘇聯革命時期，他才借着這個機緣，將他的藝術發展到頂點，他努力接受人生的全部，凡眼界以內的現象，都以極度確切的生動使牠再現出來。劇本主題所展示的，不是結構運續的進展，只是和聯想與對照的原則相符合的連續畫圖，他是從斷面去看人生的，而不足從直面看的。</p>
<p>他本着使舞台與觀眾發生連緊的企圖，以前曾利用了舞台前部，現在他更設法把動作移出，與觀眾席及觀眾打成一片，於是廢除背景和幕，沒有台口，舞台由觀眾席延長；或取消建築的屏障舞台設在劇塲中心，觀眾環繞四側，更在廂房裏演出，使舞台空間不受限制，演員便在觀眾視綫中，從化裝室裏出來，等候上台，這樣來消滅舞台的幻影，劇塲藝術從秘密和夢境變為生產暴露，生產的一切機器都故意的被強調被公開了，這便走上構成主義的舞台裝置。</p>
<p>構成法是適合於現實人　在空間自由演劇的需要，而不是攝影或裝飾的，他尋求不同的金屬，木材，玻璃製成圓柱，圖開，平方，階梯平面，傾斜面梯階，旋轉部橋樑或輪齒，把裝置做成機械似的性質，以獲得樣式。以構成法代替平面的繪畫。他的目的是把社會當成一副首先的機器，用工業及技術組織的結構表現出來。他把裝置當成賞的重要部分，把所抽取及傳達的東西當做機器的精神。他根據極端的單純化，企圖嚴肅，清楚，用來刺激有力的生活，以反抗近日生活方式之漸趨複雜文浪費。構成舞台，各部份都必須為動作而利用，使動作方便。張調和解明，成為演技的對象。（未完）</p>
<h3>「職業夫人」提示　職業婦女的困難</h3>
<p>— 陶態</p>
<p>「職業夫人」的提示並不是女人們對社會的瞭解和認識，也不是社會給女人們的幸福和滿足。而是說女人的　愛和職業不能兩全，職業婦女因職務上的關係不能如願地消遙於愛海中。這好像是告訴女人們：假使要職業，就不要有愛，假使要愛，就得放棄職業；否則就會遭遇到「職業夫人」中的情形。</p>
<p>在我們中國的職業婦女所遭遇的困難還不至這一點。記得在重慶有一個時候交通部曾經有過不用結婚婦女為女職員的消息，這使交通部下的直屬和附屬機關裡的「職業夫人」們大起恐慌，眼看飯碗立刻就要被打破。幸而不久就在參政會上給女參政員們提出責問，交部無詞可答，就收回成命，此外，抗戰期間的公務員都能領家屬米，唯獨女職員們不能領。我想想這大槪是因為傳統的上沒有女人負擔家庭生活的先例，所以當局者就保持了這一點遺風！將來可以去找祖先報功！</p>
<p>人的感情需要有寄託，所以就愛；因為生理上的要求，所以要結婚。這並不是不合理的事！她們旣結了婚，也就為家庭中的一員，當然對家庭中的一切都得和男人有同樣的責任。在這樣米珠薪桂的時候，丈夫一個人的力量不夠負擔一個家庭，為妻子的當然應該幫忙，而社會上的大人先生們往往另眼相看，眞是卑劣之極！</p>
<p>假使這位「職業夫人」有了三五個孩子而無法分身出外工作的時候，這才是降臨了眞正的困難！</p>
<p>「職業夫人」中的被談到的這一點，只是為了增加劇情的趣味，所以被劇作者寫了進去，並不是為職業婦女提出一個困難的問題。而眞正的職業婦女的困難問題，在中國是多得無其數！因為在這新舊知識交替的時候，外面的壓迫，長輩的頑固，自身的矛盾，都是職業婦女的困難！</p>

<h3>一出門來</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>上海的交通問題太嚴重了，我們籲請巿長吳國楨先生，警察局長宣鐵吾先生，公用局長趙曾玨先生，工務局長趙祖康先生，以及三百七十萬巿民，大家來努力一下！</p>
<p>目前的巿政當局，可以說都是極優秀的市政工作者，他們過去的經歷和政績足以說明了，値得我們敬佩，信仰：同時，他們知道許多的也許比我們還要多，他們對於改善交通情况的熱情，也許比你我任何一個人還要急切，因之，問題的另一面，在我們三百七十萬巿民的和他們合合作，竭誠地支持他們，擁護他們。</p>
<p>人們往往說上海爲國際觀瞻所擊，這話太忘我了，如果反過來問，不是國際觀瞻所繫呢？不是國際觀瞻所繫，我們自己仍然生活在這里，生活在這里，這里的一切都與我們的生存種種就不可能沒有關係。</p>
<p>交通問題，在這個小天地裏，是我們第一個要解决的問題。</p>
<p>這個問題倘不能得到解决，我們不帝成爲手足麻痺患者，我們進行任何事都將遭到不應有的困難。</p>
<p>這里有兩篇文字，都是談到電車，希望再有別的方面意見提出來：但有一點是可貴的，就是它代表了市民們的一般意見。我們敢相信即使不提出來一切負責者仍是照着這個目標做去的；我們又不敢相信，因爲這幾篇文字，大上海的電車立刻便得到改善。</p>
<p>但還是提出來，且準備不斷地提出來，原因在怕健忘：自己健忘，別人健忘。</p>
<h3>電車荒　什麼道理？</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>隨便什麼時間，只要在馬路上停留一兩分鐘，就可以看到電車開來開去，總之，每天從早到晚，電車是在街上行駛着。然而，當人們在某些小站候車的時候，往往等了好久，還見不到一輛電車開來，尤其是一路的電車，有時候會一個鐘點看不到它的影子。這時候，乘客們頗覺奇怪，甚至於認爲這是「電車荒」。</p>
<p>根據非正式的統計，一路的車子約有十六輛，二路的車子約有廿六輛，一路從起點到終點要一小時零三十分，慢的時候會超過兩小時，二路從起點到終點需一小時，慢的時間需一小時零二十分。平均的速度最多不過三分鐘會有一輛電車通過一站。依照這個車輛的數字與行車速度是不應該發生車荒的現象，這究竟是什麽道理呢？也許上海人太多了！</p>
<p>。茲僅以個人乘電車的經騐以及負責電車工作人員的談話中，蒐集起來，有以下幾個主要的意見：</p>
<p>一·十字路口交通的阻絕。從靜安寺開到外灘及虹口必須經過南京路，車子由西向東，往往會碰到許多由南向北或由北向南的車子正在行駛，在警察指揮之下，綠燈不出來，是不能開過去的。</p>
<p>二·司機駕駛的速度不很固定，或快或慢而不能適當駕馭，把握速度。</p>
<p>三·公務員上下班的時間，人特別擁擠。乘客們爲了爭取時間拼命向車廂裏擠，結果最後一個人的身體一半在裏面一半在外面，電車門關不上，車子不能即刻開，而躭擱很長的時間。</p>
<p>四·車子調配不均，往往連續會有七八輛一路，或十幾輛二路接踵而至，有時則久等無車。</p>
<p>此外，有兩件目睹的事實寫在下面：</p>
<p>一·在江西路候車子，曾經碰到過五次，一路電車急駛而過，到站不停，直至開過相當距離才停下來，這種距離是使乘客們連跑也追不上的。</p>
<p>二·還是在江西路，總是星期日的上午，候車到虹口等了一個多鐘點，二路車子開過去十幾輛，一路的車子依舊一輛未見，曾有四次之多。然而他們很技巧的來欺哄乘客們，當二路車子到外灘後，再開出來，車子前面的路牌却換上了「一」字，表示車子是從虹口開出來的。</p>
<p>但是，聰明的乘客們，任你電車司機玩什麼花樣，他們總究是可以窺破的。</p>
<p>所以，我們不要變戲法，還是打開天窗說亮話，想出具體的辦法來解決這個問題。這裏，我以私人的立塲貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>一·適當調配車子，務使在行駛時二路與一路皆有。</p>
<p>二·請司機們專心自己的工作，大家協同一下，將速度概略統一，絕不許太快或太慢。</p>

<p>蒭蕘之見，電車公司當局，以爲然否？</p>
<h3>乘電車者有同感否</h3>
<p>— 紀織</p>
<p>在今日的上海，除了有錢的人以外，普通市民，對於每月一筆相當可觀的車費支出，一定力求　節，出外時，坐黄包車覺得太貴，更不必說三輪車與汽車了。雖然安步當車，有益身心健康，可惜鞋　破費太大，結果祇好借重比較價廉的電車了。</p>
<p>我現在毫不誇張地記錄一些在電車中發生的事，未知讀者有否同感？</p>
<p>在車子將要駛至車站時，如果有人從車廂裏擠出來，那麽左右的乘客必定要埋怨他，「還沒有到站呢，幹嗎怎樣燥急。」然而等到車子到站，下面的人已蜂擁上來，這時擠不下車，又得遭人埋怨，弄得哭笑不得。</p>
<p>乘電車的人大都很自私，已經乘在車上的人，時常慫恿司機到站不要停，結果，在站上等着的人果然不能上車，有時連必須要下車的人都給他們弄得不上不下，我曾看見兩個在麥根路上車的小學生，本來預備到卡德路下車，結果一直被送到泥城橋，兩個人急得哭喪着臉，怕誤了上課時間。</p>
<p>還有，要想上車的人總喜推別人的背脊，高呼「朝裏跑」，一等到自己踏上月台，思想馬上轉變，向後面的人喊：「擠不下了，乘下部車吧！」乘電車的人還極善辯，開始，看見不遵守排隊規則的人會大聲申斥，等到自己耐不住也去亂擠時，就辯解說：「別人不遵守規則，我爲什麽要遵守呢？」</p>
<p>急於要上車的人往往拉住別人的衣服或後領，甚至有扯住別人的耳朶的，已司空見慣，不足爲怪了。</p>
<p>從前，電車乘客對於老弱婦孺，總有讓坐的習慣，現在已漸漸减少，甚至於沒有了。</p>
<p>壞的風氣替代了好的習慣！</p>
<h3>扒手落網　衣冠楚楚不像偷兒</h3>
<p>— 承遞</p>
<p>關於掱手，眞是不說也罷，提起了簡直是沒有人不深痛而惡疾的，有人因時常遭竊而發憤，甚至戴着紙冠呌別人「謹防扒手」。由此可見人們是對掱手怎樣痛恨的程度了。</p>
<p>今日傍晚，我從工作的地方回家，經過福州路浙江路口，路傍圍着大堆人，說是捉住了掱手，我也因着好奇而向裏邊望去。現在讓我把這掱手作一簡單的描寫：</p>
<p>他穿着白帆布的西裝長褲，白色的短袖衫，淡藍色的襯衣領子翻在外邊，年紀還很輕，最多不會過二十五歲的，這樣的人不說穿，誰會相信他是掱手呢。被偷的是個鄕人，一手拿小紙包一手拿一扁担，呆呆地站在一邊。</p>
<p>那掱手不肯承認，而和鄉人辯論着，但他終爲警察抓着走了，那誠實的鄉人也跟在一起。我因着歸家的便路也就隨在他們的後邊。</p>
<p>一路上，那掱手起先和警察及鄉人抗辯，後來又向警察低聲私語，但警察沒有睬他。他似乎很感失望，再又回頭向鄕人懇求。這時他們已經到了先施公司門。口一輛三輪車駛來，車上突然跳下個穿西裝的男子，「這是掱手嗎？」他沒有等到回答便伸手向那掱手的耳光摑去，猛力地連連摑着，然後「嘿嘿！」地笑着去了，這笑是含着報復的意味，想來他也一定遇着過掱手的扒竊，而且不止一次了；所以對掱手是這般的憎恨和惱怒。</p>
<p>那掱手被打過以後，警察依然抓着他前進，他還是使用狡獪的手段，希望警察能放走他，但是沒有用，因爲已經到了警察所門口。我眼望着他們三人的背影跨進了「老閘區分所」的大門。</p>

<h3>駕車肇事在美國</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>自從上海多了一批吉普車以後，撞傷行人的事，日有所聞。但在美國，車輛失事更多，每十五分鐘就有一個人喪身輪下，有四十個人受傷。</p>
<p>戰時，由於汽油的限制，車輛出事率大跌；現在又扶搖直上了。雖然，美國現在所有的車子，比戰前還少四百萬輛，不過，交通專家門，認爲一九四六年車輛失事，將要超過最高峯的一九四一年—那一年內，有四萬個人碾死車下，有一百四十五萬人受傷。</p>
<p>今年車輛失事數目，將增加的原因很簡單：道路多已破損；車輛多已失修，使用的平均年限多已超過八年，速率限止已經取消；同時，最主要的原因，是駕車者又故態復萌：輕率，不小心。</p>
<p>十六歲至二十歲的人開車子，出事的危險性最大。他們開二百萬哩路就要壓死一個人。二十歲至二十五歲的駕車者，開八百萬哩路壓死一個人。至於四十五至五十歲的人，開車子就穩重可靠得多了。他們平均駛行二千一百萬哩才出一次大毛病</p>

<p>廿九年來！你簡直是一逕在做我的奴隷，起居飲食？侍奉得體貼周到，無微不至，每天早上，我是慣常吃麵包奶粉的，麵包烘好了，還要塗上甜的果辦和鹹的炒蛋肉醬的類，備就之後，應有盡有的裝了一盤，住在田莊的幾年間，你總親自捧着盤，從樓下房中一口氣送上三層樓來，伺候我吃，而你自己却還餓着肚子咧。我每天外出，你就留心這一天的氣候，支配我的衣服，有時我覺得穿得太多一些，但是回來的時候，就覺得恰如其分，不然的話，可要受凉了。每有朋友飲宴約會，我在家裏總是拖拖延延的忘了時刻，而你總在半小時前先催我出門，因此往往準時赴約，從無延誤。唉！到了現在，我孤零零的覺得甚麽都不便，吃要自己預備，穿要自己留意，一切的一切都已失了常態；唉！鳳呀鳳，我怎麼少得了你啊！去年臘盡，我見你形銷骨立病　　的沒有氣力，每天早上起身之後，總是自吿奮勇的罍被舖牀，你滿　子含着眼淚，泫然說道：『爺，我侍奉了你廿九年，到如今却力不從心，要你自己來鋪牀罍被，敎我如何過意得去！』我忙說：『鳳，你侍奉了我這麽久，現在該輪到我侍奉你了。回到蘇州之後，願你好好地休養，即使在牀上躺這麽十年二十年，我願意做你的特別護士，侍奉你十年二十年！」誰知回蘇不過三個月，你就撤手而去，使我不能多盡一分心力，天哪，願來生仍讓我們倆結爲夫婦，而讓你做我的丈夫，使我好好的侍奉你一輩子，以報今生米報之恩！</p>

<h3>Chairman's Message Being Drafted - Will Reiterate Earlier Views on National Affairs - Consistently Insisting on Political Solutions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, July 20th] Chairman Chiang is expected to issue an important message within three days, the content of which will explain the government's attitude towards the current situation. The message is currently being drafted and will be approximately 2,000 words in length.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, July 20th] The recent changes in some government leaders over the past two months have already attracted considerable attention among allied nations concerned about China's future. According to a certain foreign authority currently here: The current Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, and Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu in the National Government are all non-partisan individuals. This trend not only symbolizes the government's urgent need to attract talent, but also indicates that if it continues to develop automatically in this direction, it will definitely be in line with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which means that people from all parties and factions will also be welcome to participate in the government.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 20th] The Ministry of National Defense has been holding important internal meetings for days, and is extremely busy. It is also reported that Chief of General Staff Chen has flown to Nantong and other places for very brief inspections.

<h3>U.S. Ambassador Returns to Nanjing - Marshal Ma Had a Meeting with Jiangxi Chairman Yesterday and is Scheduled to Return to Nanjing in the Next Day or Two</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 20th] Regarding the Central News Agency's Kuling dispatch on July 19th, which stated that Ambassador Stuart had hinted that "important developments in the current situation will occur within two or three days," this has aroused new attention and heated discussions in the capital today. Rumors and speculations are rampant. To this end, the reporter specifically visited Mr. Fu Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, this afternoon. Mr. Fu stated that he is also paying close attention to this news, but he does not know the ambassador's true intention. He will inquire after the ambassador returns tonight. At 10:00 PM, when the reporter went to the U.S. Embassy again, Ambassador Stuart had already gone to bed. Mr. Fu still received him and stated: When the ambassador took off in Jiujiang today, the aircraft's parts needed repair, so he did not leave Xundong until about 4:00 PM, arriving in Beijing at 7:00 PM and returning to the embassy at 8:00 PM. He has a slight cold and a slightly elevated temperature, and a slight cough, and is now resting upstairs. The ambassador felt slightly regretful about the impression gained by the Central News Agency reporter from his conversation, as his conversation was the same as what he usually discusses with reporters, but he only said, "If we concentrate our efforts and work together, we can definitely make some progress in the current situation in the short term." He does not want it to be misunderstood. He hopes that reporters from various newspapers can understand this meaning. Mr. Fu stated: The ambassador is more familiar with the situation in China. His four meetings with Chairman Chiang have brought hope for resolving the current problems in China. The ambassador sincerely hopes that all parties throughout the country will work together to benefit the Chinese people.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, July 20th] The situation is difficult, war news is frequent, and Marshal Ma's flight to Lushan and the news of Zhou Enlai's flight to Henan have added a layer of shadow to those concerned about the situation here. The Military Mediation Department has become a decoration. The important officials who once argued for peace have mostly left or will leave. Their work after leaving is the opposite of their work in the Military Mediation Department. The serious illness of General Peake has greatly affected the mediation work. He has gone to Beidaihe for recuperation, followed by Luo Ruixiang returning to Zhangjiakou, and now he has come to Peiping to handle the handover. (Luo is He Long's Chief of Staff) It is rumored that Cai Wenzhi will also join He Yingqin's military delegation and leave Peiping for the United States a week later.

<h3>Sino-American Cooperative Organization Denies the Calumnies Issued by Zhou Enlai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 20th] After the Kunming assassination case occurred, the government is sending personnel to thoroughly investigate and await a verdict. The day before yesterday, Zhou Enlai suddenly declared to Chinese and foreign reporters that the pistol used in the case, only the pistol transferred by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization to government secret service personnel had this silencing device. It has been published in the Shanghai Overseas Chinese newspaper on the 19th of this month. A reporter from this agency, concerned about this case by people in society, specially visited relevant personnel from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. According to them, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization Zhou Enlai referred to is not known if it is another organization. If it is the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, all weapons supplied by the U.S. were weapons for killing enemies, and there were no so-called silent pistols. This can be checked in the list of materials received from the U.S. in this organization, and there is a signature of the person in charge on both the Chinese and American sides. Zhou Enlai's statement to reporters is completely unfounded and is nothing more than an attempt to slander, provoke, and confuse the public.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, July 20th] The State Department confirmed today that eleven members of the Kunming Democratic League have taken refuge in the U.S. Consulate.

<p>[Central News Agency, Haiphong, July 19th] The Xin Guangzhou motorized sailboat, carrying 60 tons of materials such as yarn and cotton and operated by overseas Chinese, was flying the Chinese flag at 8:00 AM on July 7th while on its way to Haiphong.

<h3>Tokyo Shibuya Station Area: Japanese Police Kill Taiwanese Compatriot, U.S. Headquarters Releases Details</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaizosha, Tokyo, 20th] A shooting incident occurred in Tokyo last night where Japanese police officers shot and killed a compatriot. The U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters released information stating that a confrontation occurred near Shibuya Station between people from the Chinese province of Taiwan and Japanese police officers, resulting in two deaths and more than fourteen injuries. The Military Police Headquarters is currently investigating the cause of the incident and the origin of the weapons used. Brigadier General Fulin, Commander of the Tokyo Military Police Headquarters, reported that on the 19th at 10 PM, Lieutenant Zhang of the Chinese Military Delegation reported to the Headquarters that Taiwanese people in several trucks passing near Shibuya Station were shot at by Japanese police officers, resulting in one death and several injuries. According to the Chinese delegation, the deceased was one of the injured, and ten to thirty other injured individuals did not receive treatment in Shibuya. The Japanese side's report, however, differs significantly, stating that several trucks, a bus, and a car were passing through the area. After police officers stopped the vehicles for questioning and permitted them to pass, the last truck allegedly fired at the police chief, with the bullet missing the chief but injuring two police officers. At that time, the Japanese side also fired at the truck, which stopped due to engine damage. The Headquarters confirmed that the Japanese police shooting resulted in two deaths and fourteen injuries among the Taiwanese people. The injured were sent to U.S. military hospitals for treatment, and as of this morning's report, none of the injured are in critical condition. The Criminal Investigation Department of the Headquarters summoned two Taiwanese truck drivers to verify the Japanese police report. The two admitted that the last truck fired at the Japanese police, but claimed that the Japanese police fired into the air to stop the trucks. Brigadier General Fulin also denied rumors that machine guns were used in the conflict, stating that the cause of the incident was competition between Chinese and Japanese street vendors.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The U.S. Military Police Headquarters has begun investigating the shooting and wounding of over a dozen of our Taiwanese compatriots in Tokyo last night.

<h3>Establishing Our National Naval Policy</h3>
<p>Our naval fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Lin Zun, arrived at Wusong on the 19th. Yesterday, it sailed up the Yangtze River into Nanjing, and today it will be inspected by Chief of General Staff and Naval Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng in Nanjing. This fleet includes two escort destroyers and six minesweepers, Yongsheng, Yongbao, and Yongning, originally belonging to the U.S. Navy and gifted to China by the U.S. government after the war. They arrived in our country after traveling from the U.S. via Cuba, Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan. This fleet, flying the Chinese national flag, the naval flag, and the flag of a Chinese rear admiral, traversed the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Panama Canal, crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach the motherland, symbolizing a new era in the Pacific and the rebirth of our navy. As it undergoes inspection in the capital, we express our sincere welcome and take this opportunity to discuss the necessity of establishing our national naval policy.</p>
<p>Based on the lessons of the Anti-Japanese War and the experiences of World War II, if we want to build our national defense, we must actively establish our maritime defense and a navy to protect it. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense indicates our commitment to actively building our national defense, and the reconstruction of our navy, under the planning of Naval Commander-in-Chief General Chen Cheng, will certainly unfold actively. Various indications, such as the new fleet returning to the motherland, the U.S. government providing 271 naval vessels, floating docks, and other necessary equipment to our country, sending U.S. naval officers and personnel to China to assist in the training of our new navy, and our naval officers and personnel being sent to Britain and the United States for training, all demonstrate how much our government authorities value the role of the navy in their efforts to build our national defense. We support these government measures and express our infinite gratitude for the assistance given by our allies.</p>
<p>Some people believe that now that atomic bombs, long-range artillery, and air forces have reached their maximum power, the navy is outdated and there is no need for active construction. This is a seemingly correct but actually misleading view. World War II reaffirmed the importance of the navy's role and its indispensability. If Hitler had a strong fleet, his troops would not have been sighing as they looked across the sea at Churchill's homeland from the coasts of Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; he would have undoubtedly wanted to emulate William the Conqueror and cross the sea to conquer England. At the same time, because Britain had a powerful fleet that controlled absolute sea power, its homeland was ultimately protected from enemy invasion. Japan launched the Pacific War, and the initial victories it achieved were mainly due to its navy. At that time, the so-called "Imperial Navy" held all the sea power in the Western Pacific. The attack on Pearl Harbor devastated the main force of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet. Fortunately, the U.S. Navy had a high capacity for recovery and actively rebuilt itself, achieving victories at Midway and the Coral Sea within a year, eventually defeating the once-imposing "Imperial Navy." The decline of the Japanese Navy contributed to Japan's collapse. To date, the use of atomic bombs has not affected the power and role of the navy. The experiments on Bikini Atoll, although their details are not yet fully understood, clearly did not significantly diminish the navy's role.</p>
<p>We ourselves suffered greatly in the Anti-Japanese War because we had no navy. At that time, we had no maritime defense, and the enemy could freely enter our vast territorial waters as if it were uninhabited, allowing the Japanese invaders to transport supplies freely. We must not allow this painful experience to be repeated. We must actively build our navy. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, our navy was already leading East Asia. The disastrous defeat in that war and the construction of the Summer Palace caused our navy to stagnate for fifty years. During these fifty years, there was not only no naval construction, but also the reputation of the navy declined due to the deterioration of military discipline and poor leadership. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time has swept away past malpractices, and with the assistance of our allies Britain and the United States, the birth of our new navy is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. To build our new navy, we must first establish our naval policy.</p>
<p>First, we must establish the mission of our navy in national defense and ensure that it can fully accomplish its assigned tasks. China is not a bellicose country; it has no ambition for aggression. Therefore, the construction of our navy should be solely for the purpose of strengthening our maritime defense. Unlike the former Japan, the reconstruction of our navy can be said to be entirely defensive. Based on this principle, our navy should focus on light and fast vessels. Current indications tell us that the reconstruction of our navy is heading in this direction, which is gratifying. What we want to point out is that we must also strive for training and equipping in the field of submarines. Our national strength does not allow us to possess a navy as large as those of Britain and the United States; to enable our navy to fulfill its responsibilities, we must especially focus on training and equipping in the field of submarines.</p>
<p>Second, with Japan defeated, it no longer has a once-powerful navy. In addition to its mission of strengthening our maritime defense, our navy should also, to some extent, assume the responsibility of securing the western Pacific waters after Japan. Because our national strength is not yet sufficient, the composition of our naval fleet does not need to rigidly adhere to British and American standards. We do not need to dream of possessing battleships larger than 50,000 tons, but we must maintain sufficient other types of ships for practical use. Naval ports are indispensable. Although the concept of naval ports may differ somewhat from what it was during General MacMahon's time in Japan, the number of our seaports that can be used as naval ports is actually very limited. Following the Tsar, Lushun is a naval port shared by the pseudo-Soviet Union and us. Therefore, the construction of our naval ports must be sought in the south. Consequently, if we actively build our navy, we must at least simultaneously build our naval bases in Sanmen Bay and Yulin.</p>
<p>Third, we must create a good naval tradition. In the establishment of the Chinese army, Baoding and Huangpu both have their glorious history, establishing the tradition of our new army. Our efforts to establish a modern navy have lasted for more than fifty years, and to this day, there is no glorious tradition to speak of. To create a glorious tradition for our navy, we must step up naval training. Greenwich in Britain and Annapolis in the United States are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Briton and American. The models left to the British and American navies by Nelson and Paul Jones still endure. To build our navy, we must establish naval schools in appropriate locations to train naval talent. Sanmen Bay, located at the crossroads of the North and South Seas, seems to be an ideal location for establishing our Greenwich and Annapolis. As for the cultivation of our excellent naval tradition, there are also many glorious examples in our history that can inspire the establishment of our new navy, such as Zheng Zhilong at the end of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Building a navy involves countless aspects, which cannot be fully discussed in this article. We are fortunate that, with Commander-in-Chief Chen's talent and integrity, he will surely establish our new navy.</p>

China has little concern for the Balkan countries, which, although allied with the Axis powers, were never in a state of war with our country. Conversely, China has significant concerns regarding Italy, as the two countries were at war, and there is a long-standing economic relationship between them. Therefore, China is paying close attention to the Italian peace treaty. The Chinese government has received the draft peace treaty prepared by the deputy foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. After careful study by Chinese experts, several amendments have been proposed, which Foreign Minister Wang is carrying with him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] According to official sources, the Council of Foreign Ministers has completed drafting the peace treaties with the enemy states and will submit them for discussion when the Peace Conference opens on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The British representatives attending the Paris Peace Conference are: Foreign Secretary Bevin, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, Financial Secretary Hall, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [blank] Naylor. Prime Minister Attlee will not attend, but other ministers will attend when matters related to their respective departments are discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 19th] The Brazilian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Fentora, will depart for Paris via the United States on the 24th to attend the Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Report on Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor Released; Twelve Conclusions Prove Japanese Provocation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] A majority of eight members of the Congressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor attack made the following twelve conclusions in their formal report: (1) The attack on Pearl Harbor was an unprovoked act of aggression by the Japanese Empire. (2) Japan bears full responsibility for the attack on Pearl Harbor and its consequences. (3) U.S. foreign policy and actions provided no reason for the Japanese attack. (4) The committee found no evidence that Roosevelt, Hull, Stimson, or Knox used deception, provocation, stimulation, enticement, or compulsion to make Japan attack the United States in order to quickly obtain a declaration of war from Congress. (5) Roosevelt, Hull, and other senior government officials made every effort to avoid war with Japan on the principle of not harming national honor or endangering national security. (6) The misfortune was due to the lack of thoroughness and preparedness for the attack by the commanders of the Army and Navy in Hawaii. (7) Almost no one was surprised by the Japanese attack; however, both Washington and Hawaiian [blank] circles were aware of the danger of an aerial attack. [Missing section in the original UPI dispatch] (9) Their [blank] in [blank] judgment were not [blank] duty. (10) The War Plans Division did not instruct Major General Short, then commander of the U.S. Army in Hawaii, to be on alert, so Short could not respond promptly. (11) Army and Navy intelligence officers underestimated the value of the last intercepted Japanese telegram and did not attach importance to the earlier Japanese telegrams indicating an intention to berth American ships in Pearl Harbor. (12) The Army and Navy Departments were not sufficiently alert to the imminent outbreak of war on December 6, 1941.</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador to the U.S. Has Special Mission: Promote U.S.-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The newly appointed British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel (formerly Sir Archibald Clark Kerr), plans to spend one or two months driving across the United States to understand the state of mind of the American people and those on the street regarding Anglo-American relations. His predecessor, Halifax, set a new record by visiting all forty-eight states, but this was during the war. Now that peace has arrived, Ambassador Inverchapel's mission is different. The new post-war issue is the development of Anglo-American relations, and Inverchapel's mission is focused on this. Furthermore, at a time when the Anglo-American attitude towards the Soviet Union is drawing international attention, the issue of "one world or two" is a major problem facing the Soviet Union and Western democracies. Inverchapel has a personal friendship with Stalin and knows the Soviet situation in great detail from his time as ambassador to the Soviet Union. Therefore, many expect that he [blank] be able to bring the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union closer together in terms of politics and ideology.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Returns Home for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov has returned home for consultations, taking a special plane to Moscow via London.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy in the United States stated in response to reporter inquiries that he did not know why Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov was returning to Moscow or how long he would be away. Novikov took a plane to Moscow via London yesterday. [Blank] it is believed that Novikov has been summoned home [blank] the authorities' [blank] regarding the recent trend in U.S.-Soviet diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Inventor of Youth Serum, Prominent Soviet Scientist, Dies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th (broadcast): Prominent Soviet scientist Dr. Bogomolets died last night at the age of sixty-five. Dr. Bogomolets was the inventor of "Youth Serum," a drug that can prolong life and has been very effective. It is now widely used in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Eighth-One Anniversary: U.S. Air Force in the Pacific Holds Demonstration; Flying Fortresses Show Off Their Prowess</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. Air Force in the Pacific will hold a demonstration on the Army Air Corps Anniversary on August 1. B-29 bombers will fly in formation from the Mariana Islands to Okinawa and then to the Takanosu area on the Japanese mainland, passing over Nagasaki, Hiroshima, and Yokohama, then Tokyo, before heading out to sea and returning to the Mariana bases. A large squadron of fighters, attack aircraft, and medium bombers will also fly in formation over Japan. The Pacific Air Force demonstration area will include the Philippines and other islands, or perhaps even a flight to Korea. Since the signing of the armistice treaty on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2 of last year, a small number of B-29 bombers have dropped medicine and food in Japan. However, this is the first time they will fly in formation over Japan. The weather on August 1 is usually suitable for flying, and the aircraft will fly low on this day so that the occupation forces and Japanese people can observe them.</p>
<h3>Japan Repeatedly Made Major Mistakes in the War Against the U.S.; Secretly Requested Soviet Mediation but Failed; U.S. Navy Releases Investigation Results</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The U.S. Navy today released information on the major mistakes made by Japan during the Pacific War and the secret negotiations that took place at the time. According to the results of an investigation conducted in Tokyo last fall by the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey team: (1) Japan attempted to have the Soviet Union mediate peace negotiations before the Potsdam Declaration was issued. (2) Japanese naval aviators were almost completely wiped out during the battles of Midway and the Solomon Islands, so that the Japanese [blank] could no longer [blank] the protection of aircraft carriers. Japan never recovered from this loss. (3) [Blank] during the battle of Guadalcanal, senior Japanese naval commanders knew that they had no chance of winning. (4) The Japanese Army and Navy once [blank] merged, but the Navy opposed this. (5) The United States' [blank] in the Solomon Islands offensive made the Japanese war [blank] [blank] [blank] pale in comparison. Because Japan [blank] originally [blank] to fight a [blank] [blank] [blank] war with the United States in the Central Pacific, in 1943, the garrison left by Japan in Truk was less than 1,000 men. Its main fleet was prepared to flee immediately when the U.S. [blank] landed, because the aircraft carriers [blank] [blank] were destroyed without residue. (6) The [blank] consumption of [blank] in modern warfare is so large that it [blank] [blank] [blank]. Japan lacked gasoline [blank] [blank] ship use. Moreover, because the US submarine [blank] effect was very [blank], it felt increasingly unsustainable. Japan's lack of trained [blank] aircraft pilots was the fatal injury of this war. About 3% of Japan's best pilots [blank] died in the Battle of Midway, and 40% were injured. Their food [blank] sacrificed in the Battle of Rabuel. The details of Japan's request for peace negotiations were described by Naval Chief of Staff [blank] Tian. It is said that "Japan decided to make peace as early as May 1945. The negotiations were held in Moscow and Tokyo in June, but after more than 20 days, nothing came of it. In July, the Soviet ambassador to Japan became ill, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to [blank] keep in touch with the Soviet Embassy, so it resolutely instructed our ambassador to the Soviet Union to propose to the Soviet side that our country send a special envoy to the Soviet Union. Our ambassador immediately followed the instruction and made this proposal to the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister on July 13. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister asked: What is the purpose of sending a special envoy? Is it to ask the Soviet Union to mediate? Our ambassador replied: Yes. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister immediately declared: Stalin [blank] and Foreign Minister Molotov [blank] will all be going to [blank] Stan at this time, but they have agreed to answer after returning from [blank] Stan. In fact, our government received a reply from the Soviet Union on August 8. The so-called reply was to sever diplomatic relations with [blank]. For this reason, our efforts to request Soviet mediation to end the war failed. No conditions were mentioned during the negotiations. The Army advocated merging all the troops, but the Navy always opposed it. If the Army and Navy were really merged, the leading figures would probably belong to the Army. Under this leader, they may be divided into two factions, the Army and the Navy, but under the control of the Army, the Navy would inevitably look inferior. If the Air Force strength of the Army and Navy is not lost, then it is also possible not to merge."</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Connally Proposes Plan to Prevent World War III; Strengthen United Nations Organization</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today reported to the Senate on the proceedings of the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and submitted a plan to prevent World War III, containing seven recommendations. Connally declared that any great power wanting to abandon the goals of the United Nations organization at this time is "simply crazy" and inconceivable. It can be said that no great power wants to fight again. The United States should entrust its hopes and beliefs to the United Nations organization. To accomplish this purpose, the following seven guidelines should be followed: (1) The United States should firmly adhere to the principles of law and the spirit of the Atlantic Charter in all international negotiations and advise other countries to do the same. (2) The United States should supply the United Nations Security Council with its full complement of troops, aircraft, and warships to [blank] to maintain world peace. (3) The United States should maintain a strong army, navy, and air force to defend its territory and people and to [blank] [blank] the obligations of the United Nations Charter. (4) The international organizations stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be expressly stated in treaties. (5) The United States should submit to the judgments of the International Court of Justice in all purely legal disputes involving the United States and other related countries. (6) The United States should seek to conclude agreements with relevant countries as soon as possible, regulating the control of atomic energy and other weapons of mass destruction. (7) The United States should fully assist the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations organization in order to complete the various conditions necessary to maintain lasting peace. Connally concluded by declaring that although the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference had encountered difficulties, resulting in little success, "we must not be discouraged."</p>

<h3>Second Atomic Bomb Test: Timer to be Used to Prevent Premature Explosion; Lieutenant General Blandy Says Preparations are Complete</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Regarding the premature explosion of the dummy bomb during the Bikini Island atomic bomb exercise, electronic experts have concluded that it was caused by rogue radio signals. According to Commander Blandy's announcement, wireless communication tests will not be conducted in order to determine the origin of these interfering signals. The triggering mechanism for this exercise was more complex, connecting the dummy bomb to the electrical circuit of the cameras on the target ship. As a result, a circuit error caused the explosion to occur fifty-one minutes before the scheduled time. Blandy stated that a simpler method would be used to detonate the atomic bomb during the official atomic bomb test on the 25th of this month, as a premature explosion would severely affect the photography of the atomic bomb test, and he did not want to take any chances. He also mentioned that he had received weather reports indicating that the cloud cover threat would hopefully dissipate by the day of the atomic bomb test. If this test can be completed as planned, he intends to return to Pearl Harbor in mid-August and then fly to Washington to resume his original post.</p>
<p>[Reuters, USS Appalachian, 18th] Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy told reporters on the flagship USS McKinley that preparations for the second atomic bomb test on July 25th were complete, and good weather was expected at that time. If the atomic bomb does not explode after being submerged, it can be rendered harmless remotely, posing no danger to anyone. A small number of ships will be sent in to inspect the area on the same day as the explosion, while the remaining ships must wait five days before entering to avoid the dangerous radioactive activity after the explosion. For the second test, 1,200 animals, some of which did not participate in the first test, will be used. When asked if President Truman planned to personally attend the second test, he replied that he had no knowledge of it. When asked about the condition of pig number 311 on the cruiser Sakawa, which was swimming several hours after the explosion, he replied that it was in good condition, just a bit noisy. Other officials revealed that a timer similar to those used in bank vaults would be used to prevent the bomb from exploding too early, as the dummy bomb exploded fifty minutes before the scheduled time during today's rehearsal.</p>
<h3>Interlude in Atomic Bomb Test: King of Bikini Island as a Guest on the Ship</h3>
<p>[United Press, Atomic Bomb Test Command Flagship USS McKinley, 19th] Atomic bomb test commander Blandy announced today that King Judah of Bikini Island has been invited to observe the underwater detonation of the atomic bomb next Wednesday, or a seat will be reserved for him on this flagship. King Judah received this invitation after relocating to Ongelak Island (about 150 miles from Bikini). Mr. Blandy also visited him today, accompanied by another American official and a local interpreter, and presented him with gifts.</p>
<h3>France Demands Siam Hand Over Emerald Buddha; Territorial Dispute to be Resolved Through Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 19th] According to Siamese officials today, France has demanded that Siam hand over the so-called Emerald Buddha, which is known as the "Soul of Siam." The Buddha is twenty-three inches tall, carved from opaque jade, and is one of the most revered deities in Siam's largest temple. France bases this request on the claim that the Buddha was originally obtained from Luang Prabang, a province in French-protected Laos, Vietnam. However, Siam insists that Siam should not only keep the Buddha, but also demand the return of the Luang Prabang territory itself to Siam. The territory and the Buddha image were both incorporated into Siam over a century ago, until 1893 when Siam ceded them to France under duress.</p>
<p>[United Press, Saigon, 19th] French diplomatic sources announced today that the French government believes that it is still at war with Siam over Phibun, as the armistice treaty signed in 1941 by the Vichy government under Japanese pressure has never been recognized. The Siamese government has been aiding illegal elements in Annam and Laos, supplying them with weapons and money, making them enemies of France. France will firmly oppose Siam's application for United Nations intervention. France has informed Siam that it is willing, in the spirit of friendship, to discuss possible revisions to the Vietnamese border. Such revisions should be based on racial and historical grounds, and negotiations can only begin after Siam returns the Vietnamese territory it seized in 1941 with the help of Japan. France believes that the dispute can only be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries, without the intervention of the United Nations. France has only two demands of Siam: (1) return the two areas seized by Siam in 1941, and (2) compensate for the damage to French property within Siam, although this is "very small."</p>

<h3>Soviet Position on the German Question: No Conflict with French Interests; Moscow Reiterates Clarification to Dispel French Fears</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] Regarding the position taken by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the German question at the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet officials commented that Foreign Minister Molotov's position was the only solution that would benefit France, and that it did not conflict with French interests. There is no reason for France to be disappointed with Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal that Germany should remain unified under the authority of a central government. It is also absurd for France to believe that the Soviet Union's proposed solution to the German question conflicts with France's vital interests. In short, how the German question is resolved will be determined by the following factors: (1) whether France can prevent Britain from intervening in the Ruhr region, and if necessary, expel it from the region; (2) whether France can prevent Britain from treating the Ruhr region as an economic prize of war and prevent it from exploiting the coal produced in the Ruhr region; (3) if the Ruhr region is separated from the rest of Germany, whether France can control the region. In short, although the Ruhr region may theoretically remain autonomous and be jointly managed by Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, because the British government's influence is sufficient to sway the governments of the Netherlands and Belgium, France will inevitably be in the minority, and there is absolutely no guarantee that it will enjoy any benefits. On the other hand, the Soviet proposal would allow France to establish a strong foothold in the Ruhr region and protect its interests. Therefore, from the Soviet perspective, Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal is sufficient to proportionally represent the various forces in Europe, and it is the least detrimental to France.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battles Erupt in Central Luzon; Leader of "People's Anti-Japanese Army" Makes Final Efforts for Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 20th] According to the Manila Post, military police engaged in a bloody battle with 500 Hukbalahaps in Bulacan Province, occupying villages that serve as bases for the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," which is now raising the banner against the Roxas government. Bulacan is located north of the province of Pampanga.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 20th] Conflicts between the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" and the military police in Central Luzon appear to have reached a final stage today. "People's Anti-Japanese Army" leader Taruc is scheduled to meet with Provisional President Roxas today to personally appeal for an end to the fighting. Taruc declared that he would make a final effort in the central provinces to ensure that a peaceful solution is accepted, after a four-hour secret meeting with Interior Minister Sulluhay. Personnel from the Interior Ministry will accompany him on this trip. However, given the deteriorating situation, it is still unknown whether his trip will prevent a large-scale civil war.</p>
<h3>Discord Among Korean Parties: Fierce Fighting Occurs in Japan and Korea</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Koreans belonging to the Federation of Korean Residents in Japan and the Korean National Construction Promotion Youth League have recently been engaging in fierce fighting in various parts of Tokyo, Kawasaki, Chiba, and other places using clubs and other weapons due to discord. There have already been several seriously injured in the last two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 20th] Local newspapers report that Liu Wang-sheng (transliteration), leader of the Korean People's Party, was attacked by a group of armed thugs last night. Liu is a representative attending the meeting of the United Front of Southern Korean political parties. The political parties intend to form a legislative body based on this united front. It is reported that Liu left the home of Lieutenant Zizki, a liaison officer with the US military occupation force in Korea, at 10:00 PM last night after attending a meeting and was carrying a "White Paper" to the residence of Kim Gu, a representative of the right wing. He was captured by the bandits on the way and attacked. He was not seriously injured and managed to roll into a cliff and was rescued. According to well-informed sources, Liu was attacked by radical leftists who wanted to participate in the legislative body. However, according to another source, it may have been an attack by the right wing, in order to blame the left wing.</p>
<h3>Some Schools in Japan Still Implementing Military Training: Students Stage Strikes to Protest</h3>

<h3>Celebrities from the City's Cultural Circles Host Tea Party for Dr. Hu Shih: Don't Be Pessimistic or Disappointed, Do Your Best to Improve the Current Situation; Dr. Hu's Speech Encourages Diligent Research</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Hu Shih returned to China two weeks ago. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presidents of various universities in the city, along with celebrities from the cultural, journalism, and education circles, jointly held a tea party at the International Hotel to welcome Mr. Hu. In addition to Mr. Hu, attendees included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Secretary-General He Dekui, Director Gu Yuxiu, presidents of various public and private universities Wu Baozhen, Li Shouyong, Zhu Hengbi, Dong Xifan, etc., presidents of various newspapers Cheng Jibo, Hu Jianzhong, Feng Youzhen, etc., leaders of various cultural organizations Yan Jingqing, etc., approximately forty people in total.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, rose to speak on behalf of the dozens of hosts. He said: Since Mr. Hu returned to China, the cultural circles of Shanghai have been preparing to welcome him, and in fact, they have already prepared twice. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Hu arrived in Shanghai, he was not feeling well, and then he went to Nanjing in a hurry, so he was never able to meet with everyone. The day before yesterday, Director Gu and I returned from Nanjing and happened to be on the same train as Mr. Hu. Only then did we agree to hold a simple and sincere tea party today. Because Mr. Hu is afraid of being disturbed, the friends we invited are not too many. Mr. Hu has always been engaged in education and academic research, but at the same time, he is always very concerned about national affairs. At the time of the July 7th Incident, when everyone was summoned to Lushan, Mr. Hu was one of the strongest advocates of the national policy of resisting the war to the end and never compromising midway. After that Lushan meeting, the vigorous all-out war of resistance was launched. Mr. Hu first served abroad on a cultural mission, dedicating himself to public diplomacy, and later served as ambassador. Over the years, he further strengthened the friendship between China and the United States. After leaving office, Mr. Hu continued to engage in educational and academic work, indirectly contributing to diplomacy, which is a great achievement. This time, Mr. Hu returned to China after the victory, just as national construction is beginning. The progress of everything may not be as ideal as we would like. We are very willing to listen to Mr. Hu's great insights. We ask Mr. Hu to treat today's tea party as a conversation among family members, and to give us sincere guidance with the attitude of a thinker, so that those of us engaged in cultural work can receive a new inspiration. We firmly believe that Mr. Hu's return from overseas this time to head Peking University will contribute even more to the country. I respectfully offer a cup of clear tea and wish Mr. Hu good health!</p>
<p>Everyone cheerfully stood up and raised their glasses to Mr. Hu to pay their respects. After sitting down, Mr. Hu, with a warm smile, stood up amid applause to deliver his first public speech since returning to China:</p>
<h3>Nine Years Abroad: A Remembrance</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu said, "For the past nine years, I have stayed abroad and have not worn Chinese clothes or spoken Chinese for a long time. This time, I may bring out some foreign words when I speak, please don't be offended. I am very grateful for your hospitality, but I had diarrhea within ten hours of returning to China, which was very embarrassing, so I could not attend the two scheduled events. I apologize to you all."</p>
<p>"During these nine years, I did not participate in the many war resistance efforts that you all made in the occupied areas and in the rear; nor did I experience the various hardships you suffered. It seems like the country gave me a nine-year vacation. Now that I have returned, I truly feel like the vacation is over."</p>
<p>"When I first went abroad, it was entirely for exploratory purposes, entrusted with an informal mission by the government to see the opinion and attitude of the United States towards our war of resistance. Later, I was ordered by the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica to attend the International Historical Science Conference held in Switzerland. That was in 1938, and it was the first time our country participated in this conference. After returning to the United States from Europe, I was ordered to return to diplomatic work."</p>
<p>"During those four years from 1938 to 1942, I was engaged in diplomatic work. The responsibility was actually very light. Every day, I would just change clothes a few times and attend a few tea parties or cocktail parties. I never negotiated a treaty, never contacted a loan, and never donated a sum of money. Moreover, I told them the truth, without using diplomatic language. We have difficulties, so we honestly tell them. I want them to know that China is a civilized country and that Chinese people are honest people."</p>
<p>"Later, my task was not as easy as before. The government had already seen that in addition to our country standing up alone to resist the war, we also needed to pay attention to the changes in the world situation. But honestly, I really have nothing to report to you."</p>
<p>"Guangzhou fell before I presented my credentials, and Wuhan fell three days before I presented my credentials. This was precisely when the country was most unlucky. Although we have always advocated speaking responsibly, not being afraid of being laughed at or scolded, and not being afraid of being disliked, I felt that this attitude was not enough when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another. I felt that I should participate in the judgment. Whether my report is accurate or not can play a role in history. —I felt that just speaking responsibly was not enough. I felt that actually taking responsibility was even more difficult than speaking or writing. Writers often discuss things casually and often like to write revisionist articles, but those responsible for handling affairs cannot allow such things."</p>
<p>"In the autumn of 1942, I originally wanted to return to China, but I have a heart condition. The doctor said that it was not suitable for flying at high altitudes, and in Chongqing, I often had to run up many stone steps. Kunming is also six or seven thousand feet above sea level, which is not suitable for people with heart conditions. So, I stayed in the United States for a few more years. At that time, my desire to return to China to engage in cultural work could not be fulfilled."</p>
<h3>Not Speaking, Not Flaunting, Focusing on Reading and Research</h3>
<p>"During the first five years abroad, I never engaged in academic research. I did not write an article, nor did I do any research work. Even when giving speeches, I never had any insights. Although I received thirty-one honorary degrees, it was not through hard work. So I made a decision to work hard in the years from 1942 to 1944 to be 'silent and odorless.' 'Silent' means not speaking, and 'odorless' means 'not flaunting,' focusing on reading and research, using the vacation that the country gave me to train myself and prepare to return to China to be a teacher."</p>
<p>"Last September, the government announced that I would be the president of Peking University. Before that, the Ministry of Education did not contact me at all. Because they knew that I have a weakness: when the country is in trouble, I never hesitate or deny anything that the government announces I will do. The position of Peking University is an honor, but it is also a very difficult job. I am willing to be a teacher, a historian. This is my 'ambition' for the rest of my years."</p>
<p>"The host wants me to talk about my views as someone who has just returned from abroad, and to say something about the domestic situation. The topic is too broad and it is not easy to finish. People abroad often see the big picture and miss the small details, so sometimes they see the whole picture and don't nitpick. But after returning to China, I realized that what I heard abroad is indeed very different in many ways. What I was optimistic about ten months ago may have something to be pessimistic about ten months later. I arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, and it has only been two weeks. I have met many friends. The pile of visiting cards in Shanghai is two inches high, and the pile of visiting cards in Nanjing is also two inches high. Most of what I have heard is pessimistic, and there is also a lot of disappointment about the future. But although I have been away from China for nine years, I have not been isolated from China, and I have never reduced my concern for China. I think that looking at it from the perspective of studying history, we don't need to be too pessimistic."</p>
<p>"Nine years ago, or fifteen years ago at the time of the September 18th Incident, we carefully considered the situation, and I never advocated for easily going to war. Why? Because our economic, cultural, industrial, and other foundations were not confident enough to accept this challenge and fight this unprecedented war. When the Lushan Conference was held, we felt that we had endured enough. It was like a person suffering from appendicitis, knowing that surgery could be life-threatening, but in order to preserve their life, they could no longer be afraid of taking risks. So, we accepted the challenge and participated in the war, and we fought for eight years."</p>
<h3>Victory is Not a Rest</h3>
<p>"Looking at it from the perspective of studying history, the suffering we are experiencing now, a part of it may still be due to our insufficient efforts, but most of it may still be due to historical inevitability. Even the wealthy and powerful America has not yet returned to normal after the victory. Therefore, although we have already won, it is by no means time to rest or 'relax.' With this in mind, we may not be so pessimistic."</p>
<p>"We should study where our shortcomings lie, whether it is talent or knowledge, and then work hard to overcome them. If we continue to suffer without exploring and researching, then the time of suffering will only be prolonged. We in the cultural and education circles should grit our teeth and do our best to salvage and improve the current situation in the next five or ten years. If we ourselves are pessimistic and feel that nothing can be done, then the national affairs will truly be even more pessimistic and make people feel that nothing can be done."</p>
<h3>Military Law Department Feels Deeply Troubled: No Concrete Evidence Found in Grain Loan Case; Authorities Consider Consulting Various Review Committee Members; Garrison Headquarters Seals Up Lizhong Grain Store in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The interrogation of the Grain Loan Case has now come to an end. The account books of only fourteen grain merchants have not yet been fully checked. It is reported that no concrete evidence has been obtained regarding the suspicion of corruption against Wang Daren and Ren Xingya, and the suspicion of hoarding against Changjiang and Santai. The Military Law Department and the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters have tried to investigate the private deposits of Wang Daren and his wife, but have not found any large amounts of money coming in or going out. At the same time, Wu Rongsheng of Santai claims that all the grain was entrusted by the authorities, and the Zhejiang Grain Loan Office recently issued a certificate proving that the grain of the Housheng Company, which is affiliated with the Changjiang Company, was purchased with loans from that office. Although the highest local authorities have ordered that this case be handled strictly, legal trials must emphasize evidence, so the Military Law Department feels extremely troubled in handling this case. It is also heard that the Garrison Headquarters is currently considering inviting the members of the committee who reviewed the grain loan measures at the time to consult with them.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent Shan Baoyuan and Ye to Suzhou yesterday to seal up the Lizhong Grain Store outside Qimen. They first requested assistance from the Suzhou County Government, which sent the Grain Department and the Police Bureau to go together. They only found temporary account books and cash of more than 95,000 yuan, which were sealed up piece by piece. A reporter visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the case and the situation. It was reported that it was because of the illegal use of grain funds from the Shanghai Santai Company that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters discovered it and sealed it up pending investigation.</p>
<h3>There are Too Many Ways to Save the Country, But It All Comes Down to Two Words: Yan Huiqing Expresses Admiration for Hu Shi's Observations</h3>
<p>After Mr. Hu returned to his seat amidst applause, Mr. Yan Huiqing stood up and said: "My relationship with Mr. Shi Zhi is quite long. When he was a student, he came to Tsinghua to take the examination to study abroad. At that time, I had some connection with Tsinghua (reporter's note: at that time, Mr. Yan was probably the president of Tsinghua). Later, we often met at the Pacific Institute. Six or seven years ago, when I went to the United States, I saw Mr. Hu even more often, and it can be said that our friendship is quite deep. It has been more than seventy years since China sent diplomatic envoys to the United States. In the second year of the Xuantong reign, when I went to the United States as a counselor, several old ladies in the United States often asked about an Envoy Zhang. Envoy Zhang was handsome and dignified, and they missed him very much, but he could not speak English. Later, Mr. Wu Tingfang wore a long robe and a dark jacket, with a small melon-skin hat with a jade tablet on it. He spoke fluent English and received countless honorary degrees. At that time, I was a small staff member in the embassy, ​​and Mr. Wu's speeches were all drafted by me. However, Mr. Hu should be considered the first person in our country to serve as a national representative abroad as a scholar. Before he went abroad, we all had some doubts: Of course, Mr. Hu's knowledge and morality are not a problem, but can he be competent in diplomatic duties? It was not until I went to the United States six or seven years ago that I realized that he had truly succeeded. He represented the personality and knowledge of the Chinese people. I think the number of his honorary degrees is probably twenty or thirty? Dr. [Pu Si], an American, believed that this could promote cultural exchange between the two countries and best connect the feelings between countries. Mr. Shi Zhi has already done this for China. Mr. Hu's speech has now been influenced by his diplomatic career. He just spoke very euphemistically and very 'not easy to understand', but his meaning is very correct. Twenty years ago, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, Mr. Zhou Jimei, and several other gentlemen often talked about ways to save the country. Some said to save the country through science, and some said that there were too many ways to save the country through reading, but in fact, there was only a small four-letter English word 'Time'. I think Mr. Shi Zhi's meaning is probably referring to this. We are fundamentally too backward in everything, and we are far behind others in every aspect. However, China's future is absolutely no problem, and we can definitely be optimistic. However, it would be very difficult to jump to the first-class power in one leap. H.G. Wells also gave advice to the cultural circles in his new book 'Destiny of Homo Sapiens'. He said that the starting point of a nation lies in 'brain remnants', that is, thought and culture. I hope everyone will put in such fundamental effort, and the country's future will definitely have great hope."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Cheng Cangbo said: "We don't need to be pessimistic, and we don't need to sigh. Those who lead the nation's thinking should be more energetic. We thank Mr. Hu and Mr. Yan for their earnest instructions."</p>
<p>The two ambassadors talked very enthusiastically after the meeting. They shook hands warmly with every guest present. When the meeting ended, the clock was pointing to six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Madam Xu's Eightieth Birthday - President Sun Will Celebrate His Mother's Birthday Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Verdict on Parade Assault Case - Four Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment and Compensation for Medical Expenses and Losses to the Victims</h3>

Ruan Guangyu shall provide a written guarantee of 300,000 yuan. If you do not agree with the verdict, you may file an appeal within ten days after receiving the verdict." The original text of the verdict is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Facts</h3>
<p>The defendants Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu, on June 23 of this year, because they were celebrating the "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others going to Beijing, participated in the parade in succession. In the morning, after celebrating at the North Railway Station, while passing near Nanjing Road on Henan Road at noon, Xu Damao saw the student Yu Jinrong distributing leaflets to the paraders. He injured his head, arms, back, and legs, tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and forced him to follow the parade to the Great World, pushed him onto a truck, and was guarded by Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng. While passing the YMCA, he saw someone distributing leaflets from upstairs. Xu Damao and dozens of people, including the parade team leader and disciplinarians, rushed to the second floor of the YMCA. They saw the accountant Zhang Yong and questioned him. Zhang Yong told them that the association did not issue leaflets. They went to the ninth floor to check and quarreled with the tea server. After being persuaded by others, they returned to the second floor and assaulted Zhang Yong, pushing him out of the door and injuring his back, chest, and head. He was tied up with ropes and forced to follow the parade to Malang Road. Someone said that Zhang Yong was a "national agent" and searched his body. They wrote the words "Special Agent" on his back with red paint and pushed him onto a truck. After the parade reached Fuxing Park, Xu Damao hired a tricycle due to exhaustion. While passing near Gu Ba Road, Gu Qinliang and Huang Jiaqing saw him and told him to stop the car and send him to the police station. While the paraders were publicly trying Zhang Yong and Yu Jinle in Fuxing Park, the police found out about it and also boarded the truck and drove to the police station, detaining Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu on the truck. While parading to the YMCA, they saw people beating Zhang Yong and helped shout and beat him. After watching football and drinking tea at the association, they went downstairs. After Li Zhaolin and others saw that they had shouted and beat him before, they were escorted to the police station. The student He Xuechun saw the parade passing by from the building at home and was dragged down, injured, tied up, and had his shoes put on his back. He was escorted onto the school truck and paraded to Fuxing Park. Qiu Shengqing, who was pulled off the truck, was also entrusted by someone to distribute leaflets in front of the YMCA at 2 pm and was beaten and had his shoes placed on his chest and brought to Fuxing Park and placed on the truck. The police took the car away and sent the victims to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, filled out forms, and transferred them to the prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. Zhang Yong filed an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting compensation for losses, including a suit, 300,000 yuan in national currency, a shirt, 4,000 yuan, a Parker 51 fountain pen, 120,000 yuan, two seals, 10,000 yuan, an advertisement fee for lost seals, 18,000 yuan, medical expenses, 9,000 yuan, and 37,000 yuan in national currency lost on his body, totaling 498,000 yuan in public funds. Yu Jinle and his legal representative filed an incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for medical expenses of 260,000 yuan in national currency, a shirt, 22,000 yuan, an undershirt, 2,000 yuan, a Parker sapphire fountain pen, 80,000 yuan, and 24,000 yuan in national currency lost, totaling 378,000 yuan. He Xuechun and his legal representative filed an incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses as listed on the list, totaling 105,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Reasons</h3>
<p>After investigating, the defendants Xu Damao and others all admitted to participating in the parade on that day to celebrate the People's Representatives going to Beijing, but denied injuring the bodies of others and obstructing freedom. However, the witnesses Zhang Peixin, Tang Guifen, Sun Jing, Xu Huiqing, and Gu Liang, who were cited by Xu Damao, were either at the end of the parade or at the very end, which is not enough to prove whether Xu Damao is guilty or not. Liu A'gen, who was traveling with Xu Damao, gave conflicting statements about the situation in Fuxing Park, with Xu Damao stating that he did not enter the park. These statements are not credible. The two victims Yu Jinrong and Zhang Yong both clearly testified how Xu Damao and the paraders jointly beat them, tied their hands behind their backs, paraded them in the team, and how they were escorted onto the truck to Fuxing Park, vividly depicting the scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, witnesses Gu Qinliang and Huang Jiaqing saw Xu Damao committing the crime at the YMCA. They encountered him on Gu Ba Road and immediately told him to stop the car and turned him over to the police station. Yu Jinrong and Zhang Yong also had medical examinations at the hospital and filled out consultation forms, which should be subject to legal discussion and prosecution. Yu Jinrong also testified that the defendants Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng jointly guarded him on the truck and paraded with him to Fuxing Park. The police then drove the truck to the police station and detained the defendants. This cannot be denied that they assisted in illegally depriving others of their freedom, but their sentences should be reduced. However, they did not injure Yu Jinrong, and are not jointly responsible for harming Zhang Yong. The defendant Ruan Guangyu left the parade at the YMCA. He went to the association and saw people beating Zhang Yong and helped shout and beat him. This is proven by Li Zhaolin's testimony. Ruan Guangyu also said, "I watched football and drank tea at the YMCA and came down from the elevator. On the second floor, many people said that I was distributing leaflets and was taken to the police station by Li Zhaolin." This is enough to prove the crime of assisting in injuring others, but since it was assistance, the sentence should be reduced. Also, since he was under eighteen years old, the sentence should be reduced again. Although He Xuechun and Qiu Shengqing were also harmed by the paraders, it was not done by the defendants. He Xuechun and Qiu Shengqing also stated during the trial or at the police station that they could not identify who harmed them. Therefore, each defendant does not accept this formal responsibility, and He Xuechun and his legal representative's incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses is difficult to be considered reasonable. Zhang Yong's incidental civil lawsuit against Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu for compensation for losses, except for the part on injury, is also unreasonable and should be rejected. As for his claim for compensation for losses from Xu Damao, as stated in the fact section, except for the suit that has not been completely destroyed and should be reduced appropriately, are all considered reasonable. He is ordered to compensate for losses and medical expenses totaling 300,000 yuan. His incidental civil lawsuit against Ruan Guangyu, requesting joint and several liability for medical expenses of 9,000 yuan, is justified and should be ordered to be jointly and severally liable with Xu Damao. The rest of the losses were allegedly incurred when someone said he was a "national agent" on Malang Road and was searched, and the resulting losses cannot be claimed from Ruan Guangyu and should be rejected. Yu Jinrong and his legal representative's incidental civil lawsuit against Xu Damao requesting compensation for losses, as stated in the fact section, should be deemed reasonable and ordered to be compensated, while the request for compensation from other defendants is unreasonable and should also be rejected.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 291, the first paragraph, Article 293, paragraph 1, Article 506, paragraphs 1 and 2, Article 507, the first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 28, Article 18, paragraph 2, Article 30, Article 50, Article 51, paragraph 5, Article 66, the first paragraph, Article 70, and Article 277, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen in court, Judge Wu Shaochang.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] At Hong Taifeng Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 379 Zhongzheng East Road, three robbers suddenly broke in at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Two of the robbers each pulled out Mauser pistols, forbidding any noise. They then robbed 1 million yuan in legal tender from the accounting table. The robbers then fled with the stolen goods. The shop owner Zi Ziming followed closely behind. When the bandits reached East Zilaihuo Street, one of the gun-wielding bandits looked flustered. At this time, plainclothes police officer Zhang Shusheng from the Penglai Branch passed by and saw this situation. He knew that the person running wildly in front was definitely not a good person, so he drew his gun and chased after him, ordering him to stop. However, the thief fired his gun first. Zhang also returned fire. When he fled from Xinqiao Street to Minguo Road, all the police officers from the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station of the Yimiao Branch opened fire and also assisted in the pursuit.

<h3>Review of Graduates from Unregistered Secondary Schools Completed</h3>
<p>Examinations for qualified applicants to begin on the 23rd.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, acting under orders, conducted a review of graduates from secondary schools established by the enemy and puppet regimes, as well as unregistered secondary schools, in this city. Approximately 400 people applied for the review. The submitted documents have been reviewed, and the list of those who will be required to take the examinations and those who are exempt will be posted today at the entrance of the Municipal Bureau of Education on Rue Ma Tang.

<h3>Bricks as Chairs, Benches as Desks</h3>
<p>Primary and Secondary Schools Face a Major Crisis</p>
<p>Nearly 480,000 Children Out of School</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Beiping, 20th] Alongside the turmoil and hardship facing university education in Beiping, primary and secondary education is also facing a major crisis. Municipal schools are struggling to survive due to excessive expenses, while private schools have drastically increased tuition due to the lack of government subsidies, making it impossible for ordinary citizens, other than wealthy officials, merchants, and the nouveau riche, to afford to send their children to private secondary schools. Beiping education, which was once a national model, is not only facing difficulties in recovery, but is also in danger of becoming unsustainable. According to estimates by education authorities, approximately four-fifths of school-age children are out of school. Out of the city's 119,000 primary and secondary school students in public and private schools, only one-fifth of school-age children are attending. The number of children out of school is close to 480,000. Seven to eight out of ten of the young people in school are attending private schools, but these private primary and secondary schools have had to drastically increase tuition (without government restrictions) because they can no longer receive government subsidies (which were previously 20 million yuan per month for four months starting in March). Tuition ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan, and when combined with the cost of boarding, uniforms, and books, it is simply unaffordable for most lower and middle-class families. Even textbooks have increased in price by 480 times. As a result, there is unprecedented competition for admission to municipal schools, with the number of applicants being twenty times the number of available places. This has led to rampant corruption, turning once-reputable schools into engines of favoritism. However, municipal schools are also beginning to face difficulties. The 200 schools need 210 million yuan per month in funding, but only 160 million yuan is guaranteed, and there is no solution for the shortfall. In April of this year, there was already a "mass sick-out." The school buildings are also a problem. Out of the 200 schools, 108 are in rented buildings, and the landlords are constantly pestering the Bureau of Education to move out. The school equipment has been severely damaged and there is no money for repairs. The tragic scene of "bricks as chairs, benches as desks" can be seen everywhere. Yesterday, the Beiping Military Headquarters held a meeting and ordered troops and government agencies to occupy as few buildings as possible, and to hand over the remaining buildings to the Bureau of Education for allocation. Beiping received over a thousand buildings, and allocating some of them for school use should not have been a problem.</p>

<h3>Purge False Textbooks</h3>
<p>Old Approved Editions Should Also Be Re-examined</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] Enemy and puppet textbooks used to enslave the population were printed in large quantities before the enemy's surrender. When the enemy surrendered in August, the schools had not yet started, and the books had not yet been sold, so there were many remaining books. According to people in the book industry, this is closely related to the scarce number of nationally approved textbooks printed in recent years, the failure to implement a responsible supply system, and the panic in the book industry. Recently, the Nanjing authorities were outraged by news reports that false textbooks were still being sold and used in Ningbo and other places, and have ordered a strict investigation. In addition, when the nationally approved textbooks were first published in Chongqing, the printing companies signed contracts with the Ministry of Education stating that their national branches should not sell textbooks from false organizations. However, it has now been discovered that the same "printing house" name that distributed the nationally approved textbooks is printed on the last page of the false textbooks, so many parties are calling for legal action to be taken. Furthermore, for subjects in the nationally approved series that have not yet been published, bookstores on the market are generally using outdated pre-war editions to fill the gap. Moreover, because the Shanghai printing plates were closely scrutinized during the enemy and puppet era, many of the current editions still contain modifications made by the false Ministry of Education, with many absurd and inappropriate texts. This situation has attracted the attention of the educational administration authorities, who are seeking solutions. As for the selling prices of books, although they are allowed to adopt a mark-up method of selling at 1,600 times the fixed price, the base price should be the original price approved before the war. Any fixed prices that were increased by the enemy and puppet regime should be invalid, in order to comply with the law and reduce the burden on students.</p>

<h3>City Sports Association to Convene an Extraordinary Board Meeting This Afternoon; Reviewing the Organization of a Charity Football Match at the Request of the China Welfare Fund</h3>
<p>The City Sports Association previously resolved at a plenary board meeting, in response to the China Welfare Fund Committee's request to hold a charity football match to raise funds for disaster relief in Hunan and Northern Jiangsu, that the season was over and that the event should be held in late August. However, due to the fact that the South China Team from Hong Kong, invited by the Welfare Fund, has already arrived in Shanghai and needs to play as soon as possible, the Welfare Fund made a request to the City Sports Association for assistance with the charity match yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Therefore, the Sports Association has decided to convene an extraordinary board meeting this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the association's meeting room at 303 Shaanxi South Road. The letter from the Welfare Fund to the City Sports Association and the Sports Association's announcement are recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the City Sports Association: With regards to our request to hold a charity football match to raise funds for the disaster victims in Northern Hunan and Northern Jiangsu, we were notified by your association on the 15th of this month that the football season was over. However, when we were planning the charity football match, it was still the football season. Due to inexperience and difficulties with the procedures, the preparations were not completed until after the football season. We regret this. Li Huitang has accepted our invitation and brought the South China Football Team to Shanghai to play in the charity match and appeal for the victims. If we abandon it halfway, there will be losses in both time and money. Therefore, we are requesting your association to convene an extraordinary meeting to reconsider your decision of the 12th of this month, with a view to amending the resolution and approving the event. In order to benefit the disaster victims, we sincerely hope that you will understand our situation and make the matter perfect under law and reason. We would be most grateful." Therefore, we have decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the entire board of directors at 4:00 PM on the 21st of this month in the association's meeting room at 303 Shaanxi South Road, at the Municipal Gymnasium. We respectfully invite the chairman and vice-chairman to attend and provide guidance. Please make time to attend."</p>
<p>(Additional News) According to Mr. Shao Rugan, the secretary-general of the City Sports Association, due to the sudden nature of the event, some directors may not have received the notice. Please attend after seeing the news.</p>

<h3>Dismissed Personnel Due to Cases by the Municipal Government Must Not Be Employed; Order to Subordinate Agencies to Comply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously found that personnel dismissed from the government and its affiliated agencies due to cases were often dismissed from one agency only to be employed by another, which significantly affected personnel management. Therefore, special regulations were established regarding notification of dismissed personnel and restrictions on employment, as follows: (1) Personnel dismissed from this government due to cases shall be notified to all subordinate agencies by government order. (2) Personnel dismissed from each agency due to cases shall immediately provide their name, age, place of origin, position, and a detailed description of the case, and report it to this government for notification to all subordinate agencies. (3) Personnel dismissed due to cases shall not be employed by this government or its subordinate agencies. (4) After receiving the government order notifying dismissal cases, each agency shall forward it to the personnel management department for special registration in a register. (5) The personnel management department must check the dismissed personnel register before handling proposed appointments to avoid confusion. A general order was issued to all subordinate agencies to comply. Recently, to ensure the earnest handling of this work, another directive was issued yesterday to all subordinate agencies that, in the future, when encountering personnel dismissed due to cases, in addition to reporting them in the ten-day report form for the appointment, dismissal, transfer, and adjustment of officials at all levels, a special report should also be submitted to this government simultaneously with the issuance of the dismissal order to ensure prompt notification.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District Requests Establishment of a Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>Feng Dianbin, Bao Chief of the Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District (Zhabei) of this city, Hu Liang, representative of the district residents, and Xu Liansheng, a resident of the district, stated that before the war, Zhabei had densely packed houses, numerous shops, and a prosperous market, no less than Binan. There were originally five publicly operated vegetable markets: Gonghe Road, Changan Road, Wuzhen Road, Gongyi Lane, and the Daxing Vegetable Market on Zhongxing Road. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, public and private buildings were completely stolen and dismantled by the enemy and puppets. Since the victory, the market has recovered, and the population has increased, but the necessary vegetable markets are lacking. Recently, vendors have been setting up stalls along Nanxing Road, which obstructs hygiene and traffic. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the district office yesterday, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting permission to establish public vegetable markets as soon as possible to benefit residents and improve the appearance of the city.</p>

In addition, the Chinese stock market retreated, making it even more difficult to rally. Yisha gradually fell from the high price of 11,300 yuan and Yinglian from 11,500 yuan, reaching low prices near noon. As a result, although Yisha, Yinglian, and Asia fell, the declines were not large. Yeguang Paper and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent, Steel fell by ten percent, and Yipi remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold and Cash are Both Stable; Slightly Higher than the Previous Close</p>
<p>Yesterday, saffron fluctuated from flat to stable. In the early morning, it opened at 1.955 million. After the opening, the securities market was active and once saw a high price, retreating to a low of 1.945 million. Silver shops had a slight appetite for it, and then it stabilized. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 35 bars at a price of 1.955 million. After that, it fluctuated. At noon, the securities firms slightly replenished their positions, rising back to 1.975 million. It was slightly stable in the afternoon, but it was relatively quiet due to Saturday. As a result, it rose by 17,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were slightly higher, and fine silver and silver dollars were flat. The secret interest rate remained at around 1.2%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency was also initially flat and then stable. It opened at 2500 yuan to 2520 yuan in the morning. After the opening, it briefly showed weakness, but after 10:00 AM, it gradually rose from a buying price of 2490 yuan, rising to 2550 yuan at noon. It rose slightly in the afternoon, but trading was sluggish. As a result, it rose by 40 yuan compared to the previous close. The price ratio to gold was 774.5 yuan per ten taels, and the price ratio to British exchange was 3 yuan and 54 cents. Hong Kong millet was initially flat and then firm, and as a result, it rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange was still at 550 yuan to 560 yuan, Indian exchange was at 660 yuan to 670 yuan, British exchange was at 8800 to 9000, and the US exchange remained largely unchanged.</p>
<h3>Government Bond Trading is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds remained deserted, with less than one million yuan in transactions. Tongbing initially retreated from 840 yuan to 820 yuan. Near noon, it slightly replenished its positions, rising back to 870 yuan before stabilizing. The overall trend was stable. Dingzhong was the same. Jiayi and Wu struggled slightly, and the results were slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Ordering is Not as Good as Receiving Cash</h3>
<p>Hardware is Cheaper than American Prices</p>
<p>According to authorities in the import and export industry, a large number of American goods have recently arrived at the port, and there are many buyers. The reason is that the prices of American goods have increased dramatically, and the arrival dates are generally not accurate. It is better to purchase spot goods in this city. Also, the prices of American hardware such as hinges and screws exceed those of domestic products. Before the war, these items were exported to the Nanyang Islands and other areas, and they had a good reputation. Although wages have increased sharply, the prices are still lower than those in the United States.</p>

<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory, in order to improve delivery efficiency, reorganized the original numbering of Jia, Yi, and Bing groups, each with 200 oil shops, that rotated to distribute edible oil. It has been decided to resume the distribution system next Wednesday. Each household will still be limited to one barrel, containing three and a half dans. Prices will be announced on the same day, and goods will be delivered the next day. To save time, checks will be used instead of promissory notes. According to yesterday's market oil prices, each dan is priced at 61,000 yuan, which is the same price when the factory started distribution on March 20. It is also understood that since the factory temporarily suspended distribution on the 8th of this month, it has been gradually selling a total of several thousand dans of edible oil on the market every day.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Market Trend is Slightly Weak; Future Outlook Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Since the return of tight money, the rising trend of asphalt has stopped abruptly. In recent days, due to the reduced demand for soap, transactions have not been as active as in previous weeks. As traders have sufficient stock on hand, they are all thinking of selling, and the market has turned into a state of oversupply. The situation is slightly weak. However, this is only a temporary trend, because the inventory in various places is very low. The Zhejiang road market is showing strong momentum, and the Hanshi market is also very stable. Therefore, although the situation in this city is weak, it is not easy to expect a decline. The market is still expected to be stable, and the sales plans of various firms have not changed. The prices are listed below: Heben asphalt 85,000 yuan, Neiping asphalt 80,000 yuan, Duzhu 78,000 yuan, Diqian asphalt 75,000 yuan, ordinary Lan asphalt 72,000 yuan, and Macheng asphalt 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Record for American Cotton Prices; Highest Price in 23 Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 20th] The New York cotton market was very stable when it opened yesterday, but it soon became volatile and rose sharply. Due to selling, prices once retreated, but were limited, and the market became active again.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 19th] The New York cotton market rose sharply today due to outside competition, and prices set a 23-year record.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The Senate has passed the repeal of cotton control, and the bill is now being sent to the White House for signing.</p>
<h3>Central Sand White Sold at Fixed Price; Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan Sugar Transported Continuously</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the tight sugar market did not weaken, and green sugar continued to rise. Chao Gang opened the market for eight packages of "Tizhuang Qing" at 90,000 yuan, "Chong Ti Qing" at 88,000 to 89,000 yuan, up 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, dozens of packages of Huanggang Qing at 86,000 yuan, and two or thirty packages of "Ci Chao Qing" at 81,000 yuan. Jian Gang opened the market for 60 packages of "Diao Qing" at 86,000 yuan. Yesterday was the day for the fixed-price sale of Zhongsha White. All those who applied for the sixth phase at 80,000 yuan were sold at 86,000 yuan, with buyer's proof documents for verification.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that more than 40,000 packages were shipped from Taipei by the Taiwan Wheel, and 15,000 packages were also transported by the China Merchants Bureau's Yan Yue Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai earlier. It is said that not only is Taiwan sugar arriving continuously, but also Fujian and Guangdong sugar are arriving in Shanghai in succession, although sugar prices remain high.</p>
<p>It is reported that the seventh phase of Taiwan edible sugar will be directly distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to more than 600 South Goods and Tea Food stores in this city. The responsible persons of the respective trade associations have twice discussed the implementation methods with the Social Affairs Bureau in the past two days. It is said that it can be realized in the near future. According to Director Gu of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has now allowed the price to be 75,000 yuan per dan and is currently working on negotiating the retail price. The Taiwan sugar that each store plans to apply for this week (i.e., the first time) is approximately 3,000 packages, and the prices are still being considered.</p>
<h3>New Source of Timber; Philippine Islands Resumes Exports</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, 20th] In early 1946, there were 12 sawmills in the Philippine Islands, producing 120,000 feet per day, approximately 12% of pre-war production. Although the output of these sawmills is all for the needs of the Philippine Islands, at the end of 1946, several of these factories, after adopting a double-shift system, will be able to resume a small number of exports. This may become a small source for the current timber shortage in China.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that yesterday's timber market was sluggish for foreign pine, and the price of fir was also depressed. Recently, Hongxing brand red willow boards have been popular, because many short bungalows on the market use this board as doors.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Prices are Difficult to Approach; Medium-Grade Domestic Goods are Most Popular; Tunxi Stock is Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tianjin Gang and others were actively buying and selling Baozhong green tea from Xiang Xiao Ke Gang. However, the supply of high-quality teas is still available, while the inventory of medium-grade goods is thinner. Sellers are insisting on their prices, and the market is slightly rising. Other domestic sales of various varieties have not decreased, and there is not much change in the market situation. In the foreign tea market, Indian merchant Yulong Yangxing has inspected and bargained for Taiwan Medium Red, but the price offered is below 50,000 yuan per dan, while the seller requires a price above that, so whether the transaction will be successful is still being negotiated. As for Wenzhou Xinzhenmei, exporters continue to purchase it at the original price.</p>
<p>The Tunxi tea market has been unusually quiet recently. Tea companies have very little appetite. Currently, Xia Hongqing (Zicha) is 110,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan, Zhenglu Maocha (spring tea) is 100,000 to 110,000 yuan per dan, and second-class tea is 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Tea merchants and tea vendors have about 2,000 dans of Maocha that have not been sold. Foreign companies such as the Great China Tea Company, Xinghua Company, Anhui Company, Dadi Tea Factory, and other private tea companies have accumulated hundreds of dans of Maocha and have not yet started refining. According to general observations, if foreign companies do not improve, they may switch to producing domestic tea.</p>
<h3>Foreign Xian Rice Declines Across the Board; Early Rice Enters the Market at 60,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total registration of goods in the North and South rice markets reached 11,715 shi, including 7,128 shi in the North market, 4,063 shi in the South market, and 524 shi transported and sold by rice companies themselves. The decline in the South market was particularly strong, with early rice entering the market at 60,000 yuan. Foreign Xian rice declined across the board by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. In the North market, high-quality Buxian rice was slightly better, and Baiyuan also showed vitality.</p>
<p>Flour remained at a tentative price. Bran was firm. Wheat digestion in various ports was still moving but not prosperous, and prices were being raised sharply. Broad beans were flat, while medium and low-grade goods fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Raw kernels and sesame were similar. Soybeans were mediocre. Oil prices stopped rising and turned down, retreating by a little over a thousand yuan. Distribution oil has been issued, and demand has turned weak. Digestion in various ports has also stopped, and the situation is becoming weaker. Soybean cake, which is used for fertilizing fields, has a firm trend.</p>
<h3>American Tung Oil Production Increases Greatly; British Price is £235 Per Ton</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The current tung oil stock in the UK has reached a dangerously low level. In order to quickly remedy this situation, the Supply Department has been searching the market for Far East tung oil. For several periods, the UK purchased Far East tung oil at a price of £214 per ton, but Chinese exporters are still insisting on £235 per ton. Currently, China's tung oil production has shrunk to a quarter of the pre-war annual production. However, after a large amount of oil is put on the market, the current high price level is expected to fall. In recent years, there have been several developments in other oil sources. Among them, the tung fruit industry in the American Gulf Coast and Brazil has progressed rapidly, and production has tripled. The progress of production in Brazil is also very satisfactory. If all tung trees can bear fruit, the quantity exported to the United States is expected to be very large.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stabilizes; Cotton Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable, and customers' appetite opened up slightly. People's hearts also saw stability. 20s yarns recovered by 10,000 to 20,000, but transactions were still sparse.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegram rose again by 10 to 22 points, with near-term US$35.80 and long-term US$35.90. The spot price of Metrin hit a new peak of US$36.47. Due to the depletion of stock in this city, the market has continued to rise. Tongyi Yarn Factory and Changre Wuxi and other small factories have slightly replenished their stock, but transactions seemed dull due to Saturday. Prices still rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>New Look of the Ancient Capital</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Xi'an by Our Correspondent Li Chi on the 10th</p>
<p>The ancient capital of Chang'an witnessed brilliant days in politics and culture during the Zhou, Qin, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Unfortunately, it gradually declined, sometimes almost becoming a relic in the Wei River basin between the mountains and plateaus. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, this ancient city stood firm, like a revival without official recognition, rivaling those "nouveau riches." Its population suddenly increased from less than 200,000 to 400,000. In the late period of the War of Resistance after the Central Plains Campaign, it almost exceeded 500,000. After the victory last autumn, some residents continued to move eastward, temporarily reducing the population by tens of thousands. But then, unexpectedly, the population began to increase daily. According to the latest statistics, the urban population has exceeded 510,000 and shows signs of further growth.</p>
<p>Digging Cave Dwellings, Pulling Carts as Laborers</p>
<p>The current situation is probably due to three reasons: During the recovery period, many people originally from Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces remained here due to "disrupted transportation." Also, many people were unwilling or dared not return due to unrest in their hometowns. Although the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is still open, many people from Henan are still hesitant, especially those from the flooded areas of the Yellow River. They would rather continue to borrow a corner of this ancient city wall, dig a cave dwelling to live in, with the men pulling carts and working as laborers, and the women washing and mending clothes for others. Life is tough, but they still seem satisfied: "Sir, are you telling us to return to our hometown? What would we eat and what would we do back there? Our fields and houses are still under the water! The Yellow River, with such a rush... We can still manage here..."</p>
<p>Returning Home, Returning to Chang'an Again</p>
<p>Would you find this ridiculous? Many people who ran from Xi'an back to their hometowns have now run back to Xi'an again. They are mostly because the political situation in their hometowns has changed, public security has not been restored, and livelihoods are gradually unsustainable. Anyway, they have been accustomed to being displaced outside for many years, so they look to return to Xi'an, this second hometown. Here, they think there are more solutions. There are also people from the lower Yangtze who have taken their entire families back to Xi'an, reasoning that the cost of living here is lower and easier to manage. There are also some passers-by who have been sent from the west via the Longhai Railway, who stop here, inquire, and temporarily hesitate to move forward. With these kinds of people, how can the population of Xi'an not increase? But we must point out that this is an abnormal phenomenon, a reflection of many major problems in China today.</p>
<p>More Women than Men, Large-Scale Women's Movement Unfolds</p>
<p>In this new statistic of over 510,000 residents, what's interesting is that there are more men than women, with men outnumbering women by one-tenth.</p>
<p>However, in the last month or two, under various forms of support and encouragement, the women's movement is unfolding daily for these female citizens, who are less than half the population in number. Women from all walks of life have participated in a women's movement training class. Following that, the Provincial Women's Association was established on the ninth of this month, and several core members of the Xi'an women's movement put in a lot of effort. Currently, the association includes representatives from 52 counties (Note: There are a total of 99 counties and one city of all sizes in Shaanxi Province). It is worth noting that some representatives clearly come from factories and rural areas. They will certainly not be "decorative items" of the urban women's movement. May they work hard to fight for the well-being of their sisters in factories and farms.</p>
<p>New Grain on the Market, Flour Prices Rise</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, one reason for the increase in Xi'an's population is that the cost of living here is relatively low. In fact, this is only relatively speaking, and the difference is gradually shrinking, especially since mid-June. Taking flour as an example: At the end of May and the beginning of June, each bag was only 5,000 to 6,000, but in mid-June, it rose to around 8,000, and then continued to rise. Currently, machine-made flour is selling for about 12,500 yuan per bag. There are several points worth noting in this round of food price increases: The period when it started to rise was not a "lean" month, but precisely when the new wheat was on the market. Generally speaking, although the dry-land harvest in the Wei River and Jing River basins this year was not bountiful, the average statistics show that the harvest volume was more than 70% or 80%. We have no reason to blame artificial manipulation on the unkindness of the heavens. There is a clear fact that proves that the rise in grain prices first started with the price of flour in the city, especially in Xi'an. After a short period, it then pulled up the price of wheat in the countryside. If the price increase was due to a poor harvest, it should have been the wheat price that rose first, which then led to an increase in the cost of flour.</p>
<p>Exposing the False Pretense, "Grain Shortage" Is Not a Shortage</p>
<p>At that time, some people attributed it to insufficient transportation capacity on the Longhai Railway, because the railway bureau was rushing to repair a section of the railway between Shanzhou and Luoyang, transporting road repair materials, and could not free up enough freight cars to transport wheat into the city. This is a fact, but it should not be the main reason for causing such a significant result, because the new wheat in the city and nearby countryside, which does not require railway transportation, was sufficient and more than enough at this time.</p>
<p>Wheat and flour, at this time and in this place, definitely do not have "shortage worries." The flour mills and grain stores are full of inventory. The "newly emerging" small flour shops are everywhere. A soy sauce and grocery store "expanding its business" by adding a few bags of flour to sell in front of the store is still acceptable. But when you see small hotels, small inns, and even consignment shops piling up bags of flour at the entrance to join in the fun, people worried about a "grain shortage" can rest assured, and the false pretense of the so-called "grain shortage" should be exposed.</p>
<p>Of course, the fluctuation of grain prices has had an impact on the lives of the 510,000 citizens, especially government employees after the cessation of in-kind grain rations. There is no longer a direct "chain proportion" between their income and the rise and fall of prices. However, on the other hand, if we take grain prices as the benchmark to extrapolate the prices of other commodities in the past six months, it is not difficult to understand how strong the purchasing power of customers from the countryside is in the cloth market and even in "silver shops."</p>
<p>People from the Lower Yangtze Eat Recklessly, Almost Ruining Their Stomachs</p>
<p>A lady from the lower Yangtze region, who came from Shanghai, ate pork recklessly in Xi'an to the point of almost ruining her stomach. She said that the money used to buy one catty of meat in Shanghai could buy two catties in Xi'an. Beef is only 600 yuan per catty, and mutton is less than 500 yuan, "cheap." Speaking of clothing, taking 20-count yarn as the standard, yarn produced in Shaanxi has recently fluctuated around 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan, which is not much different from the Shanghai market. The prices of cloth and cotton fabrics have recently been only about 20% to 30% higher than those in Shanghai, due to the increasing convenience of transportation from the east, which is significantly lower and more stable compared to grain prices.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when grain prices began to rise, some gentlemen and elders with a "sense of morality" ran around appealing, hoping that this ancient capital could "preserve a pure land" while other provinces were experiencing inflation and famine. Unfortunately, the "pass" of Guanzhong has long become a historical relic, and their efforts were ultimately in vain. However, thanks to the heavens, Xi'an is still a "blessed land" on the "price contour map" of major cities across the country. Thus, the 510,000 citizens can live here in peace.</p>

<h3>Turning the Decayed into the Miraculous</h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Canglong's feature article "Don't Be Afraid of Too Much Garbage, Waste Can Be Put to Good Use" yesterday, I couldn't help but deeply agree. However, I feel that it hasn't been fully explained, so I'll briefly contribute my humble opinion below.</p>
<p>Shanghai's garbage reaches about 2,000 tons per day, which is a shocking number. If we can come up with a thorough and fundamental method of disposal, dividing the city's garbage into five major categories: (1) animal waste, (2) plant waste, (3) cloth scraps and paper scraps, (4) tin cans and waste cans, and (5) coal cinder and mud ash, it would be best to add a category for broken glass. If we can go through such a practical separation, it can be said that none of it is superfluous. For example, the output of the (1) and (2) categories of garbage is particularly large, but its uses are also particularly broad, because this kind of garbage can all be used as fertilizer. If the bone waste of animals can be made into a large amount of bone meal, it is the most valuable fertilizer because the components contained in bone meal are most essential to the nutritional needs of plants, and are indispensable base fertilizers for fruit trees, crops, flowers, vegetables, etc. Because there is no bone meal production in the near suburbs of Shanghai, it is rarely used. In other places, bone meal is a major fertilizer. Now that there is a large amount of bone waste, a bone meal manufacturing plant can be established. As for plant waste such as vegetable roots, it can be used for composting, which is also the most suitable base fertilizer or top dressing. It is not only a nutrient for plants, but also promotes soil improvement. At this time when the rural economy is extremely difficult and fertilizer is lacking, it is even more necessary. In the past, most of the fertilizer needed by farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai was supplied by soybean cake from the Grand Canal. Since the war, transportation has been inconvenient and the source is lacking, resulting in reduced production. Now, using waste, two tons of compost can be used as one piece of soybean cake. Assuming that there are a thousand tons of compost per day, then 500 jin of soybean cake can be produced in one day, which amounts to a huge 180,000 pieces per year. The current market price of soybean cake is more than 5,000 yuan per piece, and its value is considerable. The value of bone meal is also quite considerable. (3) and (4) categories, as well as broken glass, can all be restored to manufacture. This kind of product is especially needed due to the lack of raw materials. As for (5) coal cinder and mud ash, it can also be of great use. The roads in various places, after eight years of the War of Resistance, have been damaged due to disrepair for many years. At this time of restoration and construction, road construction is the most essential and important work, but there is a lack of raw materials. Like the previous use of Japanese prisoners of war to step up construction, the local soil was used for temporary filling, but after the rain, it was still unusable. Now that there is this kind of coal cinder and mud ash, it can be transported to various places for repair to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Shanghai's garbage not only has a fundamental method of disposal, but can also have multiple benefits in one fell swoop. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Chickens and Ducks Fill the Lanes</h3>
<p>My relatives live in a lane, but their neighbors are chicken and duck dealers. Dozens of cages of chickens and ducks are sold out in less than half a day, but the remaining dirt and odor are never cleaned up, until the new dirt and new odor of the third batch of chickens and ducks arrives! In the past, most of the chicken and duck dealers were located along the Jiangbian area of ​​the Bund. After the war, the Tianjin North Migration became the situation today, but in a densely populated lane, it is related to public health. I hope the authorities will find some more appropriate places to let them gather markets so that the residents of the lane have difficulties in declaring it. (Shi Sheng)</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Two Points Suggested to the Government</h3>
<p>— Lu Shihao</p>
<p>(I) Saving the Dying Countryside</p>
<p>Before the war, the Chinese countryside, after suffering all kinds of blows, was already facing the danger of collapse. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the areas that experienced war disasters were both destroyed by the war and suffered from the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes. In the rear areas, the meager wages of a large number of conscripts, the supply of huge amounts of military grain, coupled with the threat of famine, have turned the entire countryside from critically ill to a path of death.</p>
<p>The destruction suffered by the Chinese countryside due to war is unprecedented in history, but never has the situation been as terrible as it is today. Take the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolution as an example. More than ten years of turmoil should be considered a "war disaster" of considerable duration. However, because the war in the past did not suffer the high degree of destruction and oppression from the Japanese invaders as it has in these eight years, and the areas that did not experience war disasters did not make such huge "contributions" to the country as they have in this war, after a certain period of time, those wounds were healed as usual under "artificial potential."</p>
<p>But today, the countryside, which was already extremely weak before the war, coupled with eight years of suffering, can no longer rely solely on those "artificial potentials" to allow time to naturally bring about recovery.</p>
<p>Will the government let these dangerous signs take their natural course, watching the entire countryside die or brewing a "complication"? Or will it think of a solution?</p>
<p>We believe that we must work hard to get rid of all terrible phenomena. There is only one way here, and that is: the government must take all responsibility, treat the entire countryside as the object, and formulate a strict method and mechanism to prescribe the right medicine for the disease.</p>
<p>Analyzing the current ailments of the countryside, they are: the lack of farming tools and seeds, the lack of funds, the harshness of land tax collection in kind and borrowing, and the exploitation of corrupt officials. The source of this series of ailments is only one: the government has never had a good system and mechanism.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the lack of farming tools and seeds first, which is an inevitable state after all disasters occur. In the past, farmers had the ability to replenish purchases or borrow money to replenish, because taxes were not as heavy as they are today. They could repay it after one or two years of hard work, but today it is different. The government must collect in kind, and they also know that debts such as "borrowing grain from empty granaries" and "borrowing money for oil and rice" with repayments of one for three are a way to quench thirst with poison. They therefore abandon farming, flee to the cities, and become beggars.</p>
<p>China's national banks organize agricultural loans every year. But these banks want collateral, and they don't trust those real farmers who are eager for "funds" to turn things around. As a result, this batch of funds all falls into the hands of special classes in the countryside. These special classes are already old hands at exploiting farmers. Now they borrow a sum of money at a low interest rate, which only increases their capital for exploitation. In this way, in the rural social class, those who enjoy the benefits without labor become richer, while those who work hard become poorer?</p>
<p>Secondly, harsh government is as fierce as a tiger, and is the most fatal wound. Regardless of the amount of harvest, collecting four dou of grain per mu, plus requisitioning and military grain purchases, will be a death warrant for the countryside. China will always be a country without statistics. The government does not know how many mu of land there are in each province and each county, how much output there is, how much military grain needs to be supplied, and how to solve and remedy it in famine years. They don't know how much surplus grain may still be available in a certain place. For the supply of military grain, they launch a whirlwind-like purchase, and one wave comes after another. The people who grow the grain have no rice to eat, and the unfair pricing makes it impossible for them to even buy other substitutes to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Under this dark and disorderly system, a group of corrupt officials get rich, while farmers who have worked hard for several years suffer even more unspeakable hardships!</p>
<p>Therefore, we would like to suggest prescribing the right medicine:</p>
<p>First of all, what should be adjusted is the rate of return between landlords and tenants. At present, the "profit sharing rate" between landlords and tenants in the countryside is about 40/60, 60/40, or 50/50. That is, the landlord's income is 40%, 60%, or half of the harvest. Under this kind of "unearned income," the landlord's investment interest is really too high. We should first reform this abnormal status quo.</p>
<p>Let us explore a new distribution rate, which is: cultivator, 50%; government, 35%; landlord, 15%. With this distribution rate, the landlord suffers a loss. But based on the principle of "land to the tiller," the government's policy of buying land and distributing it to farmers must be implemented. However, given the Chinese government's economic distress, when can it actually be implemented? If the government forcibly buys land and pays the landlords with public bonds, it may cause social unrest in China, because China is different from other countries. Most of the land is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, but is scattered in the hands of countless "small bourgeoisie." Forcible purchase without paying cash may have a drastic impact on the economy of the majority of people, bringing about all kinds of unrest. Therefore, there is only this method, which on the one hand lowers the income of landlords and alleviates some of the pain of cultivators, and on the other hand slows down the trend of land concentration, reduces the interest in investing in rural land, and achieves the goal of land to the tiller.</p>
<p>There is also a malady in the countryside that must be eradicated at present, and that is the profit-seeking of "sub-tenants." Many people obtain permanent tenancy rights to considerable land from landlords, but they do not engage in cultivation themselves, but sublet it to tenants. As a result, in addition to paying rent to the landlord, the tenants also need to offer a portion of the harvest to the "sub-tenants." This is really the most intolerable phenomenon. Therefore, we must merge tenants and cultivators into one, so that even permanent tenancy rights are limited to a specified number. Permanent tenancy rights that exceed this number should be taken back by the landlord and given to the actual cultivators in recent years.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to turn cultivators into actual owner-farmers, the government can stipulate a law, that is, after the promulgation of the "New Cultivation Law," if a tenant has obtained cultivation rights for five years, he may purchase the land from the landlord at any time. The price is based on the sum of the landlord's income over the past five years as the standard. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(Number of harvests in five years × landlord's income) × rice price = land price</p>
<p>Assuming that the total income per mu in five years is five shi, and the local rice price at the time of purchase is 50,000 yuan per shi, then</p>
<p>(5 shi × 15%) × 50,000 = 0.75 shi × 50,000 = 37,500 yuan</p>
<p>Such a law makes non-cultivators dare not invest in rural land again, and can also avoid landlords from being angry and refusing to sell their land. On the landlord's side, it is equivalent to receiving five years of benefits first, and they are also happy to sell. However, the land price should be paid in one lump sum, so as not to split the landlord's economy.</p>
<p>With this distribution rate, the government will levy a tax on the main crops once a year on land that is cultivated twice a year, and appropriately add a low rate of levy in places that are cultivated three times a year.</p>
<p>Before the war, the land tax was only five to one dou. If we follow the current collection rate, then in a bumper year, the yield per mu of land can be as high as one shi and two dou, and the government's 35% income will reach more than four dou, which cannot be said to be not generous. Therefore, under this high rate of collection, the government should make every effort to help farmers. On the one hand, it increases the income of farmers, and on the other hand, the government also increases its income accordingly, benefiting each other.</p>
<p>Now let us try to set up a new agricultural food agency for the government to adapt to this new law and environment:</p>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture and Food - Provincial Agricultural and Food Management Office -</p>
<p>Crop Research Institute</p>
<p>Fertilizer Factory</p>
<p>Farm Tool Factory</p>
<p>Cultivated Land Expansion Committee</p>
<p>Granary Tax Management Office (County)</p>
<p>Agricultural Supervision Office (District)</p>
<p>Transportation Bureau</p>
<p>Mediation Committee</p>
<p>Merging the countryside and the Ministry of Food into one can streamline the agency and facilitate work. (The fishing income work of a part of the Ministry of Agriculture can establish a fishing income department to adapt to China's needs.) In the future, the person in charge of the work is the province, and the agencies below the province will truly take responsibility for improving everything in the countryside.</p>
<p>At present, the Chinese countryside still uses ancient farm tools and feces as fertilizer, which reduces the amount of harvest. Therefore, the Crop Research Institute should take the responsibility of improving seeds and cultivation methods. At the same time, the products of the farm tool and fertilizer factories are best distributed to farmers free of charge, or sold with subsidies, and paid in installments without interest.</p>
<p>The most important part in the future is the Agricultural Supervision Office, which will be responsible for directly guiding and supervising farmers' cultivation, with the district above the county as the unit, and directly responsible to the province. The reason for being directly responsible to the province is that many institutions in China have more layers and more exploitation. In the future, the distribution of farm tools, fertilizers, or seeds will be implemented by the Supervision Office. If an extra layer of organization is set up in counties above the district, the malpractice of exploitation may occur.</p>
<p>Because collection in kind is necessary, a County Granary Tax Management Office is set up to manage the land tax in peacetime and to be responsible for the storage of grain during collection.</p>
<p>At present, many people are against the system of collection in kind, saying that it is too harsh. But we believe that the government will have to buy military grain anyway, so rather than a whirlwind-like agency, we hope that the government will use collection in kind to meet the needs of the army. At present, the land tax revenue is 70% for the local government and 30% for the central government, so the military grain is purchased within the collection in kind, which is nothing more than a "transfer transaction" between the government, and will not be harsh on the people.</p>
<p>What needs to be reformed in the collection in kind is the change in transportation and weights and measures. In the past, the grain collected often required the people to send it hundreds of miles away, and the harassment along the way and the difficulties of the grain collectors made the people feel extremely painful, which made the collection in kind condemned as harsh government. In order to avoid these malpractices, granaries should be built by the county, and the collected rice should be handed over by the people for storage, and the adjustment and transportation should be entrusted to the Adjustment Committee and the Transportation Bureau. At the same time, the instruments of weights and measures should be revised several times to avoid malpractices from arising from this.</p>
<p>In this way, the relationship between the government, landlords, and farmers becomes not a relationship of paying taxes, but a group of joint investors. Farmers are those who use labor as capital, and the government is responsible for adjusting and managing all expenditures. Therefore, both parties have more income, and landlords are like investors who do not care about things, and can only sit back and receive less dividends.</p>
<p>Through this agency, the government can know the total amount of harvest in the year, so it can plan comprehensively how to remedy in famine years and how to maintain in bumper years. At the same time, using the reports of the District Agricultural Supervision Office, it can directly provide loans to farmers, and know in detail the soil quality in the area, so that farmers can invest appropriately in a certain crop. The expansion and guidance of agricultural leisure production can also be based on evidence and actually carried out.</p>
<p>We do not approve of unified control of the rice in the hands of farmers, and allow free trading by the people. However, for the convenience of adjustment, cooperatives can be organized with the county as the unit. All the rice in the county is handled by the cooperatives, and a commission is slightly taken to subsidize the handicraft products supplied by the cooperatives, so that farmers can obtain fair and fair supply when purchasing. In this way, the number of stored grain in a county is known in detail, so that the tragedy of forced purchase of military grain will not occur.</p>
<p>The above is based on rice, but it can be applied to other products by analogy.</p>
<p>The government's final and greatest responsibility is to maintain the exchange rate between crops and handicraft products (see the next chapter), so that the price of rice will not sometimes stimulate and increase the price with handicraft products, or the grain will be cheap and hurt the farmers, and there is a risk of a sharp price drop in bumper years.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will face reality, especially when the Communist Party is strongly redistributing land, it must compare plans, consider and implement them, and demand that those who extend the "hands of malpractice" of non-"investors" be executed at any time during the execution!</p>
<p>(II) Looking at Industry from the "China Textile" Surplus</p>
<p>Following the pace of the countryside's death, China's industry is also approaching the brink of collapse. The influx of a large number of foreign goods, under the conditions of cheap and good quality, coupled with the Chinese people's craze for worshipping foreign goods, if this crisis is not prevented, we can assert that capitalists and workers will definitely not happily spend the second New Year after this victory!</p>
<p>At the 301st meeting of the Legislative Yuan on June 8, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu, reported on the surplus of the China Textile Construction Company in recent months, saying that "China Textile" had a surplus of 9 billion yuan in April and 14 billion yuan in May, and may gradually increase in the future. How was this huge surplus obtained? Wang did not explain, he only used these numbers to answer the "anxiety" of some committee members. From the beginning to the present, "China Textile" has been criticized for "competing with the people for profit," "bureaucratic capital," and "leading price increases." Although many people have defended the government's good intentions and the inaccuracy of price increases, these surpluses have exposed some of its weaknesses and shown a path to industrial rebirth.</p>
<p>Many people blame "China Textile" for leading price increases, which is wrong. We can definitely say that if "China Textile" were handed over to private management, no matter what, it would definitely not have so much profit. We should know that "China Textile" is using its superior conditions as a state-owned enterprise to obtain many opportunities to reduce costs. At a certain period, if China Textile did not increase prices, it might cause those private factories to close down completely in an uncompetitive situation. For this reason, coupled with the desire to use the surplus to make up for the national treasury, it had to shoulder the condemnation of "leading price increases."</p>
<p>However, the surplus of "China Textile" is of no help in making up for the imbalance of finance. On the contrary, handing over the "preferential treatment" of China Textile to private management and expanding it, and reducing prices to curb the rise in living standards, can achieve the dual harvest of curbing inflation and saving the industrial crisis.</p>
<p>At present, the black market price of coal per catty is quite different from the price of coal supplied by the Fuel Committee. But the current supply of coal per catty is sufficient to maintain. Why not supply general factories with "official price" coal? Therefore, we propose that all factory necessities that the government can supply at parity prices be distributed to various factories, and for those who rely on overseas, the government will settle foreign exchange at a lower rate to reduce costs.</p>
<p>In order for everyone to concentrate their efforts to fight, and to avoid merchant violence, we suggest that the government divide the country into several industrial zones, forcibly merge the factories in the zone, and make them into an organization that the Japanese used to call "integrated," and at the very least, each factory should establish an "organization" for joint procurement of raw materials and distribution of markets, in order to concentrate and exert strength and avoid the internal competition of domestic manufacturers.</p>
<p>Japan implemented such a plan in Taiwan and North China, using all its strength to strive for a goal. However, we do not need to learn from Japan's "colonial" squeeze, nor do we call on capitalists to form "trusts" or "syndicates." "Colonial" squeeze is to build the foundation of imperialism by sacrificing the blood and sweat of others. Capitalists' "trusts" and "syndicates" are monopoly groups. We can supervise the cost of industrial products by the government, strongly implement price limits, and severely punish monopolists. In this way, neither the government nor the capitalists suffer losses. Capitalists certainly cannot get huge profits, but the crisis is gone. The government seems to have lost in subsidies, but the drop in prices is equal to the contraction of currency, and the biggest harvest is the people, who will no longer taste the pain of soaring prices. Why wouldn't the government be happy to do it?</p>
<p>When the government implements "price limits," it should fairly stipulate an interaction rate between industrial manufactured goods and rural crops. Many industrial raw materials are related to rural crops. Stipulating the exchange rate between the two crops can stabilize the rural economy on the one hand and avoid prices from sometimes stimulating each other and rising on the other hand. Take flour as an example. Recently, because of the reported increase in rice prices, urban flour merchants appropriately increased the price accordingly. But in fact, the raw material of flour - wheat, did not increase in price in the countryside. When the price of flour rises, the price of wheat also rises, leading to an unnecessary price increase. This is due to the government's lax management of industry. By closely monitoring the cost of factories and stipulating the exchange rate between industrial and agricultural products, this malpractice can be avoided.</p>
<p>Many people are clamoring to shorten the exchange rate in order to save the dying industry. But if the government cannot control industry and production, suddenly increasing the price of foreign exchange is harmful and useless. In the minds of the Chinese people, a psychology of "despising national currency" has been universally formed, and many industries are related to foreign exchange. Once the price of foreign exchange is increased, the cost of foreign goods increases, but everything rises accordingly. The people do not benefit from it, but suffer from it first. As for raising tariffs and restricting imports, they are not fundamental countermeasures to suppress foreign goods. There is only one way to give the factories supplies domestically at low prices as much as possible, to settle foreign exchange with manufacturers at low prices to purchase raw materials, to adapt the merged industrial organizations to the current environment, and to strictly supervise and avoid the realization of violence. Then, when these conditions have considerable results, increase the price of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Is this strategy suitable for long-term application in China? That still needs to be decided depending on the situation in the future. However, in order to increase the interest of investors, under circumstances that permit, capitalists can be given higher profits (but on the principle of not harming the national economy), and it is stipulated that those profits must be invested in the generation of new industries.</p>
<p>Some people doubt whether the government can shoulder this heavy responsibility economically? That is impossible to explain. However, given China's current economic situation, no undertaking can be held! The situation has reached a point where it must change. This is like a person who cannot make ends meet. If he wants to purchase a necessary item, if he calculates in every possible way and hesitates, then he will not be able to purchase any items for himself. There is only one way, that is, when he feels that something is really necessary, buy it quickly, and force himself to find a way with the established fact. This is the best example when China wants to undertake something and economic doubts arise.</p>

<h3>White and Black</h3>
<p>— Ren Yu</p>
<p>I deeply love white.</p>
<p>I love the color white because it represents purity and innocence.</p>
<p>Snow is beautiful because it is purely white and crystal clear. Cotton is beautiful because it is pure without a speck of dirt, and it contains unlimited warmth.</p>
<p>I love white swallows. I love their pure white feathers and their freely flying white wings. When I see them flying in the sky, I am as happy as a prisoner trapped in a dreary hell, suddenly seeing the sunlight and feeling immense comfort.</p>
<p>I love women in white. I love their white dresses fluttering in the air. When I see them, I immediately embrace them with my soul. I caress their white clothes, kiss their white skin, hold their white arms, and admire their clean, white teeth...</p>
<p>On snowy days, I wear white clothes and go out. I walk barefoot, letting my skin kiss the earth. In the vast white wilderness, I leave behind footprints. I pass through forests dressed in white and climb hills wearing white caps. I see a white plain and houses covered with a layer of white. Ah, I am excited to the point of madness. I proudly possess the white world.</p>
<p>I detest black.</p>
<p>I deeply detest the color black because it harbors disaster, meanness, and filth.</p>
<p>I detest the black feathers of crows and their annoying "caw, caw" sounds from the rooftops. They symbolize darkness and bring disaster to people. They are the friends of ugliness and the enemies of kindness.</p>
<p>I hate the black dogs that bark "woof, woof..." at the entrance. They often demonstrate against passersby who have no malicious intent, bully innocent and lively children, curse the loud songs that drift in the middle of the night, and bark madly at the poetic shadows of trees swaying beneath them. These purchased black dogs have no appreciation for beauty. Only in front of their masters do they basely wag their tails with their tongues lolling out, trying to please their masters.</p>
<p>I despise the black pigs lying in the mud. They never leave filth. They are friends of filth. They specialize in searching for food in dirty garbage piles. Their whole bodies contain countless seeds of filth. I abhor their stupid, lazy personalities, detest their self-proclaimed "beautiful" faces, and their pitch-black color.</p>
<p>I detest black flags, black clothes, black clouds... and all black colors in the world.</p>
<p>I especially hate those dyers who specialize in turning white things black. They are experts in manufacturing darkness. White clothes, white gloves, white socks, white cloths... all pure white things turn black in their hands. Their horrible black hands are truly worthy of curses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, bleaching powder exists in the world. It serves all lovers of white, washing any stained things clean.</p>
<p>I love white, and I will always embrace white.</p>
<p>I detest black, and I will bury black with the hoe of wisdom.</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Wang Qi (carved/engraved - likely referring to a woodblock print accompanying the text)</p>
<h3>Aging</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>I don't know why, but recently, I often feel a sense of aging.</p>
<p>Looking at my appearance, my hair is still as black and smooth as lacquer. Not a single white hair appears on my head; on my forehead, "wrinkles of suffering" have not increased. My sideburns are still as neat as before, and the movement of my hands and feet has not become stiff at all... From all of this, I still retain the breath of youth. Where is the aging?</p>
<p>However, I do learn that I am aging—the shadow of aging grows deep in my heart.</p>
<p>I cannot estimate how heavy my heart is now (of course, it is much heavier than before), but I can detect the traces of its aging and feel the uneven scars on its surface. Not long ago, my heart was like a freshly cut piece of iron, the cut surface flashing with electric light, illuminating the hearts of others; however, after a year of wind and rain, patches of rust have covered the cut surface of the iron block. People are starting to feel unfamiliar with it, and the iron block itself has lost its dazzling brilliance.</p>
<p>My current mood is like that of a shepherd leading his flock home when dusk is falling, so desolate and lonely.</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago, I stepped out of the university gates. Due to circumstances, I had to run back and forth in the rolling sea of people like a calf.</p>
<p>If the encounters of people in the world can be divided into fortunate and unfortunate, then I can probably be said to belong to the former. Without using all my strength, I found a job. In this environment, I saw speculation, opportunism, amusement, and ease. Money is the soul, and enjoyment is above all else. My immature and innocent heart began to undergo a kind of baptism, a kind of exaggerated, hypocritical, and ultimately unfortunate influence; I felt that my mood was no longer as young as before. The sound of victory resounded throughout the heavens and the earth. In addition to my original duties, I also started working as a newspaper reporter at a newspaper and later switched to a magazine editor. At this time, I saw factions and infighting between people, no emotions, only exploitation; no courtesy, only tactics! Although I worked for only a very short period of time, I had seen enough. I didn't want to continue. I looked at my own heart and felt a sense of regret because it had aged a little more. Soon, I left Shanghai and went to a public institution to assist in the handover work. Here, piles of official documents chased away some of the vitality. The prevailing trend of emphasizing procedures over efficiency also changed my temperament a lot. I became cautious, prudent, timid, silent, and even learned some perfunctory skills. Although I was full of indignation at the darkness and corruption, the greatest fluctuation in my mood in the past eight months has probably been sadness over the aging of my heart.</p>
<p>Every time I returned to Shanghai, my friends patted me on the shoulder and said that I was much more "experienced." All I could answer them with was a silent bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Experienced?" Isn't that just a euphemism for "old at heart!"</p>
<p>Aging, aging! I am carrying this old age, and the pace of my steps also appears slow. I look forward to the future and feel a kind of embarrassing ridicule.</p>
<p>Am I really old?</p>
<p>On a certain midnight, I silently counted the past years: one year, two years... God: I am only twenty-five years old!</p>
<h3>Life, Music, Tears</h3>
<p>— Shuwen</p>
<p>——One of Short Memories</p>
<p>Only a person who can truly love music with all their life can truly feel the existence of life in music.</p>
<p>I once saw a girl learning piano. When she shared two months with the piano and then sat down at the piano to play the exercises from two months ago, she realized that her skills had become rusty and declined. She painfully shed tears.</p>
<p>When I saw the crystal-clear tears glistening in a pair of large eyes filled with the brilliance of wisdom, and finally could not restrain them and fell onto the piano keys, I seemed to hear the tear drops on the luminous keys, eliciting a kind of sound that, although slight, could make the soul tremble.</p>
<p>"A beautiful diamond, people can see all the joys and sorrows of the world from within." When tears and the spirit of music melt together, music shines because of tears, and tears soar because of music.</p>
<p>I love those who can truly love music with all their lives because they truly understand life.</p>

<h3>Nostalgia</h3>
<p>— Jingxing</p>
<p>For a friend whose life or death is uncertain</p>
<p>Do you remember eight years ago, on the moonlit Huangpu River bank, you leaned against the iron railing by the river, your bright dark eyes gazing at two or three small merchant ships, shining with faint lights, reflecting the rising night tide. You stared at the flowing water in a daze, and I stood aside gently stroking your shoulder.</p>
<p>Do you remember five years ago, when the enemy's iron hooves stepped into the southeastern half of the country, and the call for resistance reached its climax, you and I, with fragile hearts, escaped from the massacres of those crazy pirates, and stopped in the ancient wilderness of northern Hunan. We listened all day to news about the war. You were busy asking groups of refugees, later observers, about the situation in our hometown. I was busy writing letters, entrusting friends to find a job. You were so haggard and I was so thin:</p>
<p>Do you remember three years ago, the late Chengdu-Chongqing train boarded a ferry in the darkness and carried us across the Tuo River. The night was gloomy, and the Tuo River seemed even darker and boundless in the gloom. The faint lights on the opposite bank and the stars in the sky shimmered. We could vaguely see the smiles on each other's faces until our footprints were imprinted on the small town called Baimu. It seemed that under the carbide lamp, you were in a joyful mood. I happily peeled the last mandarin orange and shared half with you.</p>
<p>Do you remember a year ago, the dawn penetrated the top of the mountain, and in the early summer park, there were soft bird calls chirping among the trees. A cool morning breeze blew past us, and your temples were scattered. I quietly swept them up for you. In the morning air, the mountain city belonged to solitude. So we embraced in solitude.</p>
<p>In those long days, we depended on each other and traveled through half of the country. The artillery fire at the front line and the bombing in the rear could not take away our loving hearts. We will always live together! You said, and I also said, although when the news of victory came, for the sake of our aging parents at home, I agreed to your suggestion to return home alone because I knew that the organization I served would also move east in three months! If I had realized at that time that we would never see each other again, how could I have let you go alone?</p>
<p>You left for more than half a year without any news. Our organization was also stranded here due to traffic problems. For half a year, I have been busy inquiring about your news. Some people said they met you in Hankou, and some said they seemed to have seen you on the express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but they couldn't be sure. I wrote letter after letter in confusion to your home, but the answer I received was always the four big characters written by your aging parents: "Not yet returned home."</p>
<p>Worry, disappointment, confusion, and depression have made me a completely pessimistic person. I resigned from my job and wandered around the gate of the shipping company all day, hoping that among the thousands of compatriots returning home, one day I would be able to go home as well. Let me rush back to my hometown, which I have been longing for for ten years, to see the truth. Although I know very well that the Yangtze River is turbulent, and if you really haven't returned home, I believe that you may have been buried in the whirlpools of the rapids.</p>
<p>May God bless you with peace! Before I have had time to rush back to my hometown to see you. June 25, 1946.</p>
<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Mou</p>
<p>Anger and depression are forged into silence, forged into stubbornness.</p>
<p>Stubbornness can hold back tears, unwilling to fall easily. Pain, can clench teeth, heavy oppression, will risk heart to bear</p>
<p>The滔滔Jiang River; how浩荡, how majestic, and so温柔和舒畅. But, can't be塞获, look, it angry, it哮嚗, the whole world are tumbling.</p>
<p>Human emotions, are just the same.</p>
<p>Being able to laugh indulgently is happiness; being able to cry indulgently, this is also happiness.</p>
<p>Hypocritical laughter, restrained tears—these are all pain of pain.</p>
<p>Things in the world are not necessarily smooth; everyone's mood is often misunderstood, and tears cannot help you solve these, but with the washing of tears, it may be more frank and consoling.</p>
<p>If even this basic right is deprived, then the calm appearance contains a very complex and dangerous emotions.</p>
<p>Years leisurely.</p>
<p>Childhood is worthy of reminiscing and recalling.</p>
<p>I don't know when, half seems to be people's good intentions, half seems to be their own desire. Gradually became an adult.</p>
<p>Yes, desire.</p>
<p>Seeing adults laugh, seeing adults feast and entertain, who doesn't feel moved, but who knows that this is just sugar-coated bitter medicine.</p>
<p>Childhood, laugh as you please, cry as you please; now...</p>
<p>You won't know the preciousness of what you get until you lose it.</p>
<p>Ordinary things, over time, often become unattainable. Life is a drama, looking at the people in the game from the outside, maybe you will laugh and laugh, but if you are in the game yourself, how can you not suffer the same fate?</p>
<p>Being able to cry indulgently is happiness.</p>
<p>Happy people, may God bless you!</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Fire, the symbol of life, who does not greet it with joy.</p>
<p>Even if it is just a small point, a star, it has heat, it also has light, it will also become a blazing torch, it will also warm the world.</p>
<p>The world is so small in its eyes. It is able to tolerate and cleanse any amount of dirt, baseness, and filth.</p>
<p>If there were no fire in the world, who could imagine what a dark picture this would be.</p>
<p>When power oppresses it, it will lurk, it will endure, but unless it is the end of its entire life, it will still rise up with all its life's strength to weave a beautiful and brilliant pattern.</p>
<p>Fire, our ancestors once worshiped it. This is the symbol of life.</p>

<h3>Double Flying (91)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After Lihua sent them off, she returned to the house, stood by the window, and gazed with tearful eyes at the staggering figures returning on the silvery earth. She vaguely felt that she was also being taken away by them, along with her heart.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian returned to the house and quietly stood behind Lihua, sneering:</p>
<p>"They're gone, my Boss Mo! I advise you not to fall head over heels!"</p>
<p>Lihua turned around angrily, opened her mouth, wanting to say something but swallowed it back.</p>
<p>"Master, please say less. Why bother making her angry?" Mrs. Mo also felt uncomfortable and advised Zhang Xian.</p>
<p>"Who's teasing her? Other people ask her to socialize, and she scolds them for forcing her to be indecent. Now, she herself is hooking up with guests at home late at night, and doesn't allow anyone else to be around. That's upper class! Humph! 'Only the officials are allowed to set fires, and the common people are not allowed to light lamps.'" Zhang Xian babbled, pushing his melon-skin hat to the top of his head, fully revealing the air of a rogue.</p>
<p>"They are school teachers, they are visiting my house for the first time. It's neither to recognize a goddaughter, nor to make friends. They kindly came to see me, is that also considered 'socializing'? Tell me, what reason do you have to be so impolite to my guests? And what are you to me?" Lihua was simply annoyed. She argued, slamming the table. She rarely got angry like this.</p>
<p>"I am your master! I have the right to be impolite to those indecent people." Zhang Xian also shouted back, not backing down.</p>
<p>"A master can only manage a disciple's artistic matters, not private actions! Besides, I haven't been learning opera from you for a long time now." Lihua said loudly.</p>
<p>"Alright! Alright! Everyone say less." Mrs. Mo kept advising, pushing Zhang Xian out.</p>
<p>"Even if I can't manage, I still want to!" Zhang Xian said grumbling as he walked away.</p>

<h3>The Bond of Slaves</h3>
<p>— Wanliu</p>
<p>Reading "Mountain City Story"</p>
<p>Slaves are good people under the devil!</p>
<p>Good people are slaves of the devil!</p>
<p>Treacherous, despicable, shameless villains are not slaves of the devil, but running dogs of the devil!</p>
<p>The dog is a dog with its tail between its legs crossing the street!</p>
<p>The characters in "Mountain City Story" are not fabricated, idealistic, or illusory. It seems that they have not used rendering, manufacturing, or other superb techniques, but are活生生的, flesh and blood, real society, our intimate friends who are 朝夕相共.</p>
<p>So, when we watch this drama, it is not热息奔腾, 呼吸屏息... These are many active responses, but a kind of deep soul, a kind of life sympathy, a kind of human nature pity; you are happy, you are sad, as if you are encountering the same fate of slaves.</p>
<p>This is a strange and subtle discovery.</p>
<p>Because of this, its story cannot stimulate you, and the image of those miserable slaves is difficult for you to forget.</p>
<p>"Mountain City Story" is a poem of humanity, a beautiful movement, a淡的sketch.</p>
<p>He is a fragment of the絮诉, he is an uninterrupted sigh of human life.</p>
<p>We must see his whole in his fragments, we must seek his continuity in his discontinuity.</p>
<p>Its method of expression is sideways, hidden, suggestive; and our appreciation of the road should also be to seek profound in the plain, to seek complex in the simple, to seek light in the dark.</p>
<p>Don't seek intuitive induction, but seek far-reaching understanding, don't seek temporary excitement, but seek lasting aftertaste.</p>
<p>This pair of poor slaves, one died, one lonely.</p>
<p>The tragedy of mankind: that is, the tragedy of slaves.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Cover Girl</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>Please instruct the ladies, a major transformation is possible. Before watching the film, first change your target.</p>
<p>This film is said to be Rita Hayworth's first "luxurious work" in transforming her on-screen style. In fact, this film is all about "luxury." As for "splendor," strictly speaking, it seems insufficient; it can only be boasted about in advertisements.</p>
<p>The story is very simple, with the theme of the struggle between fame, fortune, love, and affection, set against a backdrop of song and dance scenes. On the surface, it seems to say that the female lead's inclination towards fame and fortune is wrong. However, after watching the film and reflecting on it, isn't the female lead's departure the best method? She not only gains both fame and fortune but also suffers no damage in love. Stories of this kind of separation and reunion are numerous in color films; "Cover Girl" has nothing particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The opening of the film is not bad, with women appearing on stage one by one, first in long robes and then in short dresses, which is still considered novel. The close-up of Gene Kelly shaking his head frequently backstage can be considered a good shot. However, the introduction of his appearance seems inadequate, and the appearance of the cover girl, Rita Hayworth, also suffers from the same problem—lack of "prominence."</p>
<p>The director places many shots in a "fashion show" style. Whenever there is an opportunity, he finds a position, aims the camera at a woman, and films her statically for a few seconds. This gives the impression that they are all fashion models. Therefore, the costume expenses for the female characters in the entire film can be said to have not been wasted, as the director tirelessly utilizes them. "Cover Girl" uses the fashion show style as the main method for capturing shots, but the methods adopted have both "skillfulness" and "inferiority." For example, the lady who tests the cover girls is often taken by the director as a model to capture her still photos, which is where the director lacks cleverness. According to the plot, this character can be exaggerated, creating a characteristic that makes her easily discovered, which can enhance the dramatic effect. As for the methods to exaggerate this lady, I think there are two common paths to take: (1) create her as a "Dong Shi"-type woman whose walking and actions are completely "lens expression" oriented; (2) create her as an "expert" who instructs others on clothing, criticizing the other party's clothing and makeup every time she sees someone. This path, of course, requires the joint responsibility of the screenwriter.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of "Cover Girl" is that no one in the entire play is prominent, and the female lead is also ordinary. Speaking reluctantly, the comical fellow can be said to be a quarter of a "prominent figure."</p>
<p>Because the story is ordinary and the characters are ordinary, most of the play is performed in mediocrity, making the audience in the theatre feel only one part excitement out of ten, followed by nine parts mediocrity, one part excitement... The long intervals between bursts of excitement are a major reason why this play cannot be called a "successful work."</p>
<p>The best scene in the entire play is Gene Kelly's shape and shadow when he is frustrated. This is the only "prominent" point that this film gives me. The shape and shadow dance on the street one after another, depicting the inner conflict extremely well. After watching this play, I feel that this is the place where the director used the most dramatic skills in the entire film and is also the place that left the deepest impression on me.</p>
<p>In contrast, the scene of Gene Kelly dancing alone with a clothes rack can be said to be terrible, completely the same as in "Thousands Cheer" (if this film was shot first and "Thousands Cheer" was shot later, then the guilt could be reduced by one level). Moreover, the entire process and the rhythm felt by the audience are not as good as "Thousands Cheer." Why is it that Gene Kelly is performing a plagiarized scene in two films?</p>
<p>"One Person, Three Shapes"! On the left is a small full-body shot, on the right is a close-up of the head, and then the close-up of the head is replaced with the magazine cover—this can also be said to be a prominent place, but this achievement is not as great as the former. Because according to the theme of his photography technique, he should be able to capture this type of shot, which is not very special. Therefore, I say: "One Person, Three Shapes" is just a good shot that should be there, and the technique is not necessarily novel; the director can easily think of it, not a unique ingenuity. The reason is just like in our Peking opera, a good performance of "Si Lang Visits His Mother" is a good action that a singer should have.</p>
<p>The two old man's memories are good, setting off the final third wedding memory and instigation, which is also good. If the play ended here, or if other writing was added, it would be better. Now, the film ends with another singing girl returning, singing and dancing together, which is simply too ordinary and too cliché, just like a child who can't write an article starts with "Life in this world." At most, it is different from others in that others are female singing, and the male returns, while he is male singing, and the female returns, but what does this change really mean?</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Gene Kelly is the best, probably only about seventy points. Fengtai Hai Huasi seems unable to grasp the personality well, the scene of acting drunk is good, but the singing and dancing are not outstanding. Fei Erbi, who plays the comical role, is good in "One Thousand and One Nights," but it is also just average. Imagine what it would be like if we changed this role to Luke Okey or Stuart Erwin? In this way, we can know the horror of Fei Er's acting. Li Baowen's "frame" is not bad, and the acting is also okay, with a promising future.</p>
<p>A few scenes of color are good, probably belonging to the scenes with red, of course, the reason why red is easy to attract people is very large. On the whole, the color is not bad.</p>
<p>If we consider this film as an introduction to women's clothing and makeup, then it is a successful film. If you think it is a film that "sells color and art," then this film has failed. I wrote these words to tell the reader that if you haven't seen this film and are thinking of watching it, then be sure to shift your target to the fashion show, and you will definitely have a very satisfactory harvest.</p>

<h3>Formalism in Acting (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The principle of stylization requires setting the main, fundamental things in a script and in each act. In order to bring out the most basic things in the script, the performer uses strong colors for contrast, simplifying the form into a diagram. People generally call his theatre a mysterious theatre. The painters he recruits regard the stage as a frame for expressing their own color composition, pushing the actors behind and letting the main artists and painters express the drama's intentions. Moreover, in order to create a certain atmosphere, they use lighting to the maximum extent.</p>
<p>Although the conditional performance began as flat and painterly, it gradually tended towards three-dimensional installation, proposing architectural composition to replace painterly decoration. Everything must be sculptural, and the ambiguity of painting must be pushed behind the scenery, which represents a move towards constructivist theatre. In the performance of "Sister Bottis," the actors do not appear in a flat, decorated setting but within a circle, using harmonious dialogue and clear, correct sculptural postures. This sculptural method brings the actors to an empty space. When staging Andrei's "The Life of Man," no decoration is used at all, attempting to abolish decoration and express the actor's detachment from the shackles of the background. Defining the contours of the actor's body and limbs and the meaning of all movements and the highs and lows of the voice, so as to give them a noble expression, this is the starting point of theatrical kinetics. The walls around the audience's seats are covered with gray curtains, the only source of light, and the design of the furnishings is extremely exaggerated. The actors' makeup is almost like masks, and the beards seem to be carved. The reason for this is to convey the sadness and emotion of dreams. At this time, Meyerhold suddenly thought of actors using stage stairs of different heights to perform. Undoubtedly, he felt that using stairs could develop his attempt to make actors break away from the sculptural method of flat scenery. And he used all his skills to unify the actors and the audience. He brought the actors to the apron stage, revealing everything to the audience. He abolished the front of the stage and the heavy curtain. He illuminated the actors with lights, making them as clear as sculptures. He was constantly experimenting, and finally, he almost turned the performance into a puppet show. In short, during this period, he was roughly influenced by mysticism and symbolism, so he hid in pure art isolated from reality. This artistic creation is mysterious, misanthropic, abstract, and symbolic, created with aesthetically refined formalism. He firmly believed that actors on the stage should become a visible symbol of the poet's thoughts. He sought stylization on the stage, so he searched for confusion in Italian "Commedia dell'arte," Eastern and medieval theatres, puppet shows, and Greek plays.</p>
<p>During the Soviet Revolution, he took advantage of this opportunity to develop his art to its peak. He strived to accept the entirety of life, and all phenomena within sight were reproduced with extreme precision and vividness. What the theme of the script shows is not a continuous progression of structure but a continuous picture that conforms to the principles of association and contrast. He looked at life from a cross-section, not from a straight face.</p>
<p>Based on the attempt to connect the stage with the audience, he had previously used the front of the stage. Now he tried to move the action out and integrate it with the audience seats and the audience. So he abolished the background and the curtain, without a proscenium. The stage was extended by the audience seats; or the architectural barriers were removed, and the stage was set in the center of the theatre, with the audience surrounding it on all sides. The performance was also staged in the boxes, so that the stage space was not restricted. The actors came out of the dressing room in the audience's line of sight, waiting to go on stage. In this way, the illusion of the stage was eliminated. The art of theatre changed from secrecy and dreams to production exposure. All the machines of production were deliberately emphasized and made public, which led to the constructivist stage design.</p>
<p>The constructive method is suitable for the needs of real people performing freely in space, not for photography or decoration. He sought to make cylinders, open diagrams, squares, stair planes, inclined ladder steps, rotating bridges, or gear teeth from different metals, wood, and glass, making the device seem mechanical in nature in order to obtain a style. He replaced flat painting with the constructive method. His purpose was to treat society as a primary machine, expressing it with the structure of industrial and technical organization. He regarded the device as an important part of appreciation, treating what was extracted and conveyed as the spirit of the machine. Based on extreme simplification, he attempted to be serious, clear, and used to stimulate a powerful life, in order to resist the increasingly complex and wasteful modern lifestyle. Construct the stage, each part must be used for action, making the action convenient. Zhang's harmony and explanation have become the object of acting. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>"Professional Woman" Suggests the Difficulties of Professional Women</h3>
<p>— Tao Tai</p>
<p>The suggestion of "Professional Woman" is not women's understanding and knowledge of society, nor is it the happiness and satisfaction that society gives to women. Rather, it is saying that women's love and career cannot have both; professional women cannot fulfill their wishes to enjoy themselves in the sea of love due to their job responsibilities. This seems to be telling women: if you want a career, don't have love, if you want love, you have to give up your career; otherwise, you will encounter the situation in "Professional Woman."</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered by professional women in our China are more than this. I remember that in Chongqing, there was a time when the Ministry of Communications had a message that it would not use married women as female staff, which caused a great panic among the "professional women" in the directly affiliated and subordinate agencies of the Ministry of Communications, who saw their jobs about to be broken immediately. Fortunately, it was soon raised by female senators at the Senate, and the Ministry of Communications had no words to answer, so it withdrew the order. In addition, civil servants during the Anti-Japanese War could receive family rice, but female staff members could not. I think this is probably because traditionally there was no precedent for women to bear the burden of family life, so the authorities maintained this legacy! In the future, they can go to their ancestors to report their achievements!</p>
<p>People's feelings need to be entrusted, so they love; because of physiological requirements, they want to get married. This is not an unreasonable thing! Since they are married, they are also a member of the family. Of course, they must have the same responsibilities as men for everything in the family. At a time when rice is expensive and firewood is scarce, the strength of the husband alone is not enough to support a family, so the wife should help, and the adults and gentlemen in society often look at them differently, which is extremely despicable!</p>
<p>If this "professional woman" has three or five children and cannot spare time to work outside, this is when the real difficulties descend!</p>
<p>The point mentioned in "Professional Woman" is only to increase the interest of the plot, so it was written in by the playwright, and it does not raise a difficult problem for professional women. The difficult problems of real professional women are countless in China! Because at this time of transition between new and old knowledge, external oppression, the stubbornness of elders, and their own contradictions are all difficulties for professional women!</p>

<h3>Once Out the Door</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The traffic problem in Shanghai is too serious. We urge Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, and the 3.7 million citizens to work hard together!</p>
<p>The current municipal authorities can be said to be excellent municipal workers. Their past experiences and achievements are enough to explain it, and they deserve our respect and belief. At the same time, they know many things, perhaps even more than we do. Their enthusiasm for improving the traffic situation may be more urgent than any of you or me. Therefore, on the other hand, it is up to us, the 3.7 million citizens, to cooperate with them and wholeheartedly support them.</p>
<p>People often say that Shanghai is tied to international impressions. This is too selfless. If you ask the other way around, isn't it tied to international impressions? If it is not tied to international impressions, we still live here. Living here, everything here must be related to our survival.</p>
<p>The traffic problem, in this small world, is the first problem we need to solve.</p>
<p>If this problem cannot be solved, we will become patients with paralyzed limbs, and we will encounter undue difficulties in doing anything.</p>
<p>Here are two articles, both talking about trams. I hope there will be other opinions raised. But one point is valuable, that is, it represents the general opinion of the citizens. We dare to believe that even if it is not raised, all those responsible will still go in this direction. We dare not believe that because of these articles, the trams of Shanghai will be immediately improved.</p>
<p>But it is still raised, and prepared to be raised constantly, because we are afraid of forgetfulness: self-forgetfulness, other people's forgetfulness.</p>
<h3>Tram Scarcity What is the Reason?</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>At any time, as long as you stay on the road for a minute or two, you can see trams coming and going. In short, trams are running on the streets from morning to night. However, when people are waiting for a bus at some small stations, they often wait for a long time and still don't see a tram coming, especially route 1 trams. Sometimes they can't see its shadow for an hour. At this time, passengers feel quite strange, and even think that this is a "tram scarcity."</p>
<p>According to informal statistics, there are about sixteen route 1 trams and about twenty-six route 2 trams. Route 1 takes one hour and thirty minutes from the starting point to the end point, and it can take more than two hours when it is slow. Route 2 takes one hour from the starting point to the end point, and it takes one hour and twenty minutes when it is slow. On average, at most, a tram will pass a station every three minutes. According to this number of vehicles and driving speed, the phenomenon of tram scarcity should not occur. What is the reason for this? Maybe there are too many people in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Now, based only on my personal experience of taking trams and the conversations with the staff in charge of tram work, I have collected the following main opinions:</p>
<p>1. Traffic obstruction at intersections. To go from Jing'an Temple to the Bund and Hongkou, you must pass Nanjing Road. When the car is heading from west to east, it will often encounter many cars heading from south to north or from north to south that are running. Under the command of the police, the green light does not come out, and you cannot drive past.</p>
<p>2. The driver's driving speed is not very fixed, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and cannot properly control and grasp the speed.</p>
<p>3. During the time when civil servants go to and from work, it is particularly crowded. Passengers desperately squeeze into the carriages in order to save time, and as a result, half of the last person's body is inside and half is outside. The tram door cannot be closed, and the car cannot start immediately, which delays a long time.</p>
<p>4. The allocation of cars is uneven. There are often seven or eight route 1 trams or more than a dozen route 2 trams following one after another, and sometimes there is no car for a long time.</p>
<p>In addition, two witnessed facts are written below:</p>
<p>1. While waiting for a car on Jiangxi Road, I have encountered five times when a route 1 tram sped past, did not stop at the station, and stopped only after driving a considerable distance. This distance makes it impossible for passengers to even run after it.</p>
<p>2. Still on Jiangxi Road, always on Sunday mornings, waiting for a car to Hongkou for more than an hour, more than a dozen route 2 trams passed, but a route 1 tram was still not seen. This has happened more than four times. However, they skillfully deceive the passengers. When the route 2 tram arrives at the Bund and then drives out, the route sign in front of the car is changed to the number "1," indicating that the car is coming from Hongkou.</p>
<p>However, smart passengers, no matter what tricks your tram drivers play, they can always see through them.</p>
<p>Therefore, let's not do magic tricks, let's open the skylight and speak frankly, and come up with concrete ways to solve this problem. Here, I offer a little opinion from a personal standpoint.</p>
<p>1. Properly allocate cars, so that there are both route 2 and route 1 trams running during operation.</p>
<p>2. Please ask the drivers to concentrate on their work, cooperate with each other, and roughly unify the speed, and never allow it to be too fast or too slow.</p>
<p>3. When there are too many passengers, the ticket seller should really control and sincerely advise guests not to get on.</p>
<p>4. It is best not to skip the station, otherwise, the station will become an empty check, and the order will be chaotic.</p>
<p>These are my humble opinions. Does the tram company think so?</p>
<h3>Do Tram Riders Feel the Same?</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhi</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, except for the rich, ordinary citizens must try to save money on the considerable amount of car expenses spent each month. It is too expensive to take a rickshaw, not to mention a tricycle or a car. Although walking is good for physical and mental health, unfortunately, the cost of shoes is too great, so they have to rely on the relatively cheap tram.</p>
<p>I am now recording some things that happen in trams without exaggeration. I don't know if readers feel the same?</p>
<p>When the car is about to drive to the station, if someone squeezes out of the carriage, then the passengers on the left and right must complain to him, "It's not the station yet, why are you so anxious." However, when the car arrives at the station, the people below swarm up, and at this time, if they can't squeeze off the car, they will be complained about, making them laugh or cry.</p>
<p>People who take trams are mostly selfish. People who are already on the car often encourage the driver not to stop at the station. As a result, the people waiting at the station can't get on the car. Sometimes even the people who have to get off the car are messed up. I once saw two elementary school students who got on the car on Maigen Road and were originally prepared to get off at Kade Road. As a result, they were sent all the way to the Nicheng Bridge. The two were so anxious that they were crying, fearing that they would be late for class.</p>
<p>Also, people who want to get on the car always like to push other people's backs and shout "Run inside." Once they step on the platform, their thinking changes immediately and they shout to the people behind: "It's too crowded, take the next car!" People who take trams are also very good at arguing. At first, they would loudly rebuke people who didn't follow the queuing rules. When they couldn't stand it and went to squeeze, they would argue: "Other people don't follow the rules, why should I follow them?"</p>
<p>It is commonplace to see people who are eager to get on the car pulling other people's clothes or collars, and even pulling other people's ears.</p>
<p>In the past, tram passengers always had the habit of giving up their seats to the elderly, weak, women, and children, but now it has gradually decreased, and even disappeared.</p>
<p>Bad habits have replaced good habits!</p>
<h3>Pickpocket Arrested - Dressed Impeccably, Doesn't Look Like a Thief</h3>
<p>— Submitted</p>
<p>About pickpockets, it's really better not to mention them. Bringing them up makes everyone deeply resent and loathe them. Some people, because they are often robbed, become indignant and even wear paper hats, shouting to others, "Beware of pickpockets!" From this, you can see the extent to which people hate pickpockets.</p>
<p>This evening, as I was returning home from work, I passed the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road. A large crowd was gathered by the roadside, saying that a pickpocket had been caught. Out of curiosity, I also peered inside. Now, let me give a simple description of this pickpocket:</p>
<p>He was wearing white canvas trousers, a white short-sleeved shirt, and a light blue shirt collar turned out. He was very young, no more than twenty-five years old at most. Without being told, who would believe he was a pickpocket? The victim was a villager, holding a small paper package in one hand and a carrying pole in the other, standing blankly to the side.</p>
<p>The pickpocket refused to admit it and argued with the villager, but he was eventually taken away by the police, with the honest villager following along. Since it was on my way home, I also followed behind them.</p>
<p>Along the way, the pickpocket initially argued with the police and the villager, and then whispered to the police, but the police ignored him. He seemed very disappointed and turned back to plead with the villager. By this time, they had reached the entrance of the Sincere Company. A rickshaw drove up, and a man in a Western suit suddenly jumped off. "Is this the pickpocket?" Without waiting for an answer, he raised his hand and slapped the pickpocket in the face, repeatedly and forcefully. Then, he laughed "Heh heh!" The laugh contained a sense of revenge, suggesting that he must have encountered pickpocketing before, and more than once; hence his hatred and anger towards pickpockets.</p>
<p>After the pickpocket was beaten, the police continued to lead him forward. He still used cunning tricks, hoping the police would let him go, but to no avail, because they had reached the entrance of the police station. I watched as the three figures walked through the gate of the "Old Zha District Sub-Bureau."</p>
<p>Brief Collection of Opinions</p>
<h3>Hoping for Calm Winds and Quiet Waves - No Further Developments from the Stockade</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Reports say that Zhang Zhiben, the head of the investigative team for the takeover work, has arrived in Shanghai, and the rest of the team will arrive within days to begin investigating the handling of enemy and puppet assets. Let's hope for calm winds and quiet waves, and that there will be no further developments from this.</p>
<p>China's fourteen major export commodities are currently preparing to hold an exhibition, with invitations to famous people to give speeches and take turns entertaining foreign guests. Whether this will lead to a sharp increase in export figures is still questionable. On the other hand, the glass counters on the streets specializing in imported goods are full of all kinds of items, and without the need for advertising, Chinese people flock to them. The reason for this is self-evident.</p>
<p>It is said that most of the cases in which the legal guidance center run by the city's women's association provides pro bono representation for women in court are abandonment cases, and it is likely that many of them are caused by "anti-Japanese war wives."</p>
<p>In the embezzlement case of the two railway bureaus, one employee named Wang Sanchuan was released on bail after being interrogated by the court. The three characters "Wang Sanchuan" put together seem like the character "Nong" (弄, to play with/get). No wonder people suspect that he is good at "playing" with money.</p>
<p>Counterfeit US dollars of various denominations, such as twenty and fifty dollars, have been discovered. I am not at all concerned about this news, but my ten-year-old child at home is flipping through the business section of the newspaper every day. When asked why, I learned that he had exchanged a dollar for coins on the street.</p>
<h3>Car Accidents in America</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Since the addition of a batch of Jeeps in Shanghai, the number of pedestrians injured by cars has been increasing daily. However, in America, car accidents are even more frequent, with one person dying and forty people injured every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>During the war, due to gasoline restrictions, the rate of car accidents plummeted; now, it has soared again. Although there are now four million fewer cars in America than before the war, traffic experts believe that car accidents in 1946 will exceed the peak of 1941—in that year, 40,000 people were killed and 1.45 million injured by cars.</p>
<p>The reasons for the increase in the number of car accidents this year are simple: many roads are damaged; many vehicles are in disrepair, with an average age of more than eight years; speed limits have been lifted; and, most importantly, drivers have reverted to their old ways: recklessness and carelessness.</p>
<p>People aged sixteen to twenty are the most dangerous drivers. They kill one person for every two million miles they drive. Drivers aged twenty to twenty-five kill one person for every eight million miles they drive. As for people aged forty-five to fifty, they are much more stable and reliable drivers. They average 21 million miles before having a major accident.</p>
<p>One person dies and forty people are injured every fifteen minutes.</p>
<h3>One Mistake After Another</h3>
<p>— Hua Mei</p>
<p>At a banquet, a guest chatted with the person next to him, criticizing the beautiful and expensively dressed woman who was singing to entertain the guests.</p>
<p>"Her singing is terrible; she's giving me a headache. Who is she?"</p>
<p>"Yes! She sings terribly. She is my wife."</p>
<p>"Oh, she is your wife, no, I didn't mean she sang badly. I was referring to the song, the song is so childish. I wonder which writer wrote it?"</p>
<p>"I wrote it..."</p>

<h3>Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (14)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>For twenty-nine years! You have simply been my slave, providing attentive and thoughtful care in every aspect of my life, from my daily routines to my diet, leaving nothing to be desired. Every morning, I am accustomed to eating bread and milk powder. After the bread is baked, it must be spread with sweet jam and savory scrambled eggs and meat sauce. Everything is prepared on a plate. During the years we lived in the country villa, you would always personally carry the plate, in one breath, up three floors from the downstairs room to serve me, while you yourself were still hungry. Every day when I went out, you would pay attention to the weather and choose my clothes. Sometimes I felt that I was wearing too much, but when I came back, I felt it was just right, otherwise, I might have caught a cold. Whenever there were dinner parties or appointments with friends, I would always procrastinate at home, forgetting the time, and you would always urge me to leave half an hour early, so I was always on time, without delay. Alas! Now, I feel all alone and nothing is convenient. I have to prepare my own meals, pay attention to my own clothes, everything is out of order. Alas! Feng, oh Feng, how can I live without you! Last December, I saw that you were emaciated and weak, and after getting up every morning, I always volunteered to make the bed and fold the quilt. You had tears in your eyes, saying, "Master, I have served you for twenty-nine years, but now I am too weak to do it. It hurts me to see you making the bed and folding the quilt yourself!" I quickly said, "Feng, you have served me for so long, now it's my turn to serve you. After returning to Suzhou, I hope you rest well. Even if you lie in bed for ten or twenty years, I am willing to be your special nurse, serving you for ten or twenty years!" Who knew that only three months after returning to Suzhou, you would leave me, leaving me unable to do any more for you. Heaven, I hope that in the next life we will still be husband and wife, and that you will be my husband, so that I can serve you well for a lifetime, to repay your kindness in this life!</p>
<p>Although you did not often put yourself in social situations, mingling and entertaining, you would generously host guests who came to our home. When relatives came, you would chat and talk with them until evening, when they had to stay for dinner. Knowing that there was not much good food at home, and there were no restaurants nearby, I didn't have to worry. You would arrange everything yourself, impressively serving a table of dishes, which I secretly admired. Although you didn't read much, when the Shen Bao newspaper was delivered every day, you would flip through it and concentrate on reading it for ten or twenty minutes. To this day, I still remember you sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper with your glasses on. You could distinguish right from wrong and never admired vanity. After seeing the extravagance and wantonness of the family of a traitor next door, you would constantly scold them behind their backs. The fact that I was able to maintain my integrity for nine years was not without your subtle influence.</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been too many events in our family. We married off two daughters and took in a daughter-in-law, fulfilling half of Xiang Ping's wish. I don't know how much effort you put into it. The year before last, my mother suffered from terminal jaw cancer and eventually passed away. In addition to assisting with the funeral arrangements, I don't know how many tears you shed. In addition, with rising prices and a difficult life, you were always cautiously supporting the household. Although I often comforted you, saying that there were economic solutions and that I would never let you starve, you were like Fan Zhongyan, the person in our family who worried about the world before anyone else and enjoyed the world after everyone else, and you could never feel at ease.</p>
