<h3 id="c1">停戰命令中三項提示　主席切盼全盤商決　周恩來昨訪馬歇爾長談 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕聞馬歇爾特使及其幹部，亙數日夜不休不眠之超人精力，草成永久停戰之新方案，並聞非正式之三人軍事會，已於十七日下午在寗海路五號馬使官邸開始舉行，如談話結果雙方意見得以接近，可　時宣布正式開會，停戰商談已於急管繁絯中大步踏向和平之門行進　八，十九，廿日三天，將爲確定中國命運，中共命運之重要關頭。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕本日距停戰限期僅有五日，國人對大局未來之發展雖悲觀樂觀各有　法，而幕後新聞暗示，當前待決之各項重大問題的裏面，並不如外傳之複雜玄秘。聞中共代表周恩來十七日晨十時與馬歇爾特使長談二小時半，曾就有關東北停戰諸問題（包括東北共軍駐區及地方政權，交通管理各事）及東北整軍比例問題，有所商談，詳細内容未發表。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕蔣主席在中樞紀念週席上，分析當前國内政局謂，對於共黨問題，政府始終採取政治解決方針，然共黨則一味拖延，破壞國家和平統一。主席最後謂：現東北停戰期限，僅有四五日，切盼在此期間，能商定具體辦法，使停戰令中之三項提示能全盤解決。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十七日電〕和平談判成功與否之關鍵，似有賴於馬歇爾將軍與執行總部以及執行小組美方代表之仲裁權限如何確定一間題能否獲致協議。政府已明白表示將堅持仲裁原議之立塲，政府代表徐永昌將軍，昨以有關仲裁權問題之正式備忘錄一件，送交共黨代表團，共黨方面尙未答覆此項備忘錄，但將堅持以各方意見一致爲原則。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據交長俞大維談：恢復交通之原則及辦法，大體確已決定，三日後即可公吿，聞廿日前可望成立具體之協議，希爾上校今晚擬再訪周恩來，對恢復交通一事作決定性之商討。關於拆除碉堡，參加管理，護路警察諸問題，雙方意見大體均已接近。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕華北各鐵路管理局，現正以焦急之心情，期待交通恢復談判之成果。交通部曾電令平漢隴海及膠濟三路局工程人員，積極準備，一俟談判協議成立，即分發各區積極工作。隴海鐵路副局長吳士恩及平漢鐵路漳銘段工程處長均在京，均待最後之消息。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕白魯德十七日未成行已改十八日飛長春，某官方負責人語記者，白氏赴長主要任務，仍爲完成長春執行分部之事務準備，以待東北全面停戰方案成立後，即時開始工作。目前至二十二日間，執行部雖可根據三月二十三日三方協議執行調處，但因為期過短，人員調配不及，且在此短期内，亦無太多必要，故東北執行分部工作展開，實猶待於和平憲章之確立也。執行部政府委員鄭介民昨晚返平後，今日到部辦公，因事務繁忙，上下午平市記者十餘人往訪俱未接見，僅下午語記者，新協定之簽訂，仍以舊協定爲根據，要在努力實施而已。今日已步人停戰第十日，和平司令台之執一行部中，暑氣逼人，政府中共雙方發新聞益審愼，記者所向碰壁，莫不叫苦。</p>

<p>〔合衆社瀋陽十六日電〕據美國賠價團團員昨日遞交賠償專員飽萊之初步報吿稱：在去年九月至十一月兩個月内，蘇聯佔領軍自東北搬走之物資，其數量之巨，幾令人難以置信。該賠償團初步報吿中之數字，係根據中國經濟部官員，日人工廠人員，及個人考察所提供之材料。據鮑萊宣稱：此種調查，顯示搬出物資，大多在去年九月中旬至十一月間。惟令人難於置信者，爲蘇聯之官員，可在如此短促時間內，搬運如此大量之物質。又據該初步報吿稱：自瀋陽區工業中所移去之設備，似較東北其他地區爲多，蓋因瀋陽係東北之最重要城市，並爲運輸中心地。鮑萊及其團員之大半，本週即將前往東京與麥克阿瑟將軍會商，惟由工程專家荷達爾所率領之團員十二員，則將在東北滯留一月，於返華盛頓後，再與鮑萊會晤。該團一部份人員，將於本星期二前往台灣視察，俟鮑萊到達該處後，則伴同　往巴黎。</p>

<p>（五）破壞交通：自停止衝突，恢復交通命令頒布後，各交通路綫，先後被共軍襲擊破壞者，計有：隴海鐵路綫上之太廟白塔埠·八義集·新安·阿湖·運河·大許家等車站及商邱至民槿問之鐵道。津浦錢上之兗州·大汶口·馮家口·唐官屯·漢沽·唐山·馬廠等車站及臨　支綫與　　車站附近等。膠濟路綫上之益都·高密塔耳堡·丈嶺等車站及新店·周村·明水·龍山之綫·平漢路北平·保定及石家莊之綫，安陽·湯陰　·廣水·武勝關問。道清鐵路綫上之汲縣車站。同蒲鐵路綫上之太谷·徐清問·候馬聞喜間，介体·平　間。正太鐵路綫上之陽泉車站及平定·娘子關間。白晋鐵路綫上之沁縣附近鐵路及子洪　鐵橋。平綏鐵路綫上歸綏車站附近及集寗·卓資山之間。業柏　赤峯鐵路綫上之天義車站。錦承鐵路綫上之平泉車站·凌源車站及北禎太平房之間，北寗鐵路綫上之萬家屯車站及北　路西段全綫等，均遭共軍光後　機破壞。</p>
<p>阻碍交通恢復情形：初北平執行部談判時，共黨即藉口力爭　路及管理權，以延宕交通恢復，繼由美方擬定方案，並經軍事三人小組批准，下令雙方部隊協助恢復，然共軍又以維　交通之碉堡及城防工事，必須完全撤除爲藉口，加以阻撓，茲舉其阻碍事實如次：隴海路徐州以東已修復，但共軍不許通車。平漢路決定先修共軍佔領區内之元氏至高邑段，並於三月廿七日開始舖設路軌，但共軍於三月卅一日復將修復錢道破壞，並將枕木運走。膠濟路張店以西，被共軍阻撓停頓。津浦路太安至利國驛段，泊頭至晏城段，亦被共軍阻撓停頓。其餘如平綏路之南口，膠濟路之高密，均被共軍藉口阻撓，迄未開工。此外，扣留及搶擊調處執行小組政府及美方代表人員，各地執行小組原屬執行停止衝突命令之各方代表人員，任務重大，旣爲共方所同意，無論在任何區域或任何衝突地點，均有視察行動之充分自由，乃共軍　多方欺騙或肆意留難，使小組人員無法施行職權，或藉口保護，禁止自山行動，近政府及美方代表，被共軍扣留及擊傷者，計有泊頭小組政時及美方代表一行七人，於五月五日被共軍假協商之名，誘至南皮扣留，同時共軍即在津浦北段發動攻勢，小組代表迄至十二日始獲釋放。承德小組共軍代表，迭次阻撓政府及美方代表前往各地調查，美方及政府代表均被監視，不能工作。赤峯小組政時及美方代表，自五月五日即被共軍禁綱於招待所內，迄今尙未獲得自由，雖經北平調整三方委員命令前往各衝突地調查，　共方組員不肯隨行，美代表復請求單獨離城調查，亦被拒絕。朝陽小組共方代表，始終藉故不參加，對政府及方代表以保護爲名，禁止自由行動。又共軍於二月廿六日攻擊平泉東南八十里郭仗子一帶之國軍，三月一日承德小組美方代表魯夫上校一行數人，經由平泉乘　前往調處，詎小組人員所乘汽車經小寺溝進入共軍防區後，竟遭共軍機槍掃射在半小時之久’汽車被擎中多處。廿六小組美代表漢瑞夫中校，曾在北票遭共軍狙擊，背部受傷，挪導人員被擊斃命。（續昨日—完）</p>

<p>上海機製國貨工厰聯合會，前天舉行抗戰勝利後第一次會議，決定發起「愛用國貨運動」「愛用國貨」，這是二十年來的老調，不圖今天還得重彈，而且更需要強調，真夠傷心！洋貨充斥市場，幾已觸目都是「美式配備」民族工業奄奄一息，整批工厰關門亦已見端，在這時候益覺國貨運動的意義重大。如果國貨沒有了出路，中國工業豈但艱困，簡直要趨於絕路的了！</p>
<p>本報社論，指出中國工業前途的危機，已非一次，但大聲疾呼，有何用處，曾不能撼動主持經濟政策者之毫末。我們敢說一句痛心的話：一百個一千個國貨工厰企業家的呼號，在今天「官僚資本」與「買辦政策」交相輝映之情勢下，很少會動主管當局的聽聞的。今天若干大員的打算，只是多運一些便宜洋貨進來，多收一些稅，多賺一些錢，多印一些鈔票，多拍賣一些「外快」的財產而已，國貨絕跡，工業衰敗，經濟崩潰，何嘗值得他們的一顧？</p>
<p>民族工業家因為火燃眉目，急呼「愛用國貨」，以為大家本着良心用國貨，工業危機就可挽回。其實這也看得太簡單了。今天中國工業何以會弄到這般景象？原因當極很複雜，然而也非常明顯。譬如：（一）國內政局杌隍不安，交通迄未恢復，貨運不暢，原料昂騰，直接增加生產成本；（二）政府對平定物價，迄無全盤計劃，以致小漲小回，循環不已，生活指數繼續增高，工資亦隨而增加，只要開支薪給一項，工厰已經不勝負担；（三）工潮層出不窮，工人在提出改善待遇要求而外，動輒罷工，甚至以群眾暴力，毀物毆人，紀律廢馳，效率低落，使厰方頗有「維持乏術，停閉不能」的感覺；（四）外匯低，洋貨廉，洋貨稅輕，國貨稅重，國產製成品已無法與洋貨競爭，再加以人民愛用洋貨的心理，便使國貨無立足之餘地。……就把這几點來看，可知對症下藥，在今天已不是僅僅提倡國貨所能濟事。</p>
<p>上述原因，在朝當局，固也知之甚諗；尤其是新任的經濟部部長次長，大都來自民間，且或曾自營企業，或久任會計查帳，中國工業界身受的痛苦，實際的危機，豈還有不知之理？聞王雲五部長擬於本月底召開全國經濟會議，謀為中國工業打開一條出路，千萬不要再是會而不議，議而不決，決而不行，徒然耗費了幾萬幾億的國幣。固然，我們決非不能奢望政府對挽救工業厄運可有一種萬應靈丹，但無論如何最切實的辦法獎勵出口，而不斤斤從關稅收入數額上計較，則鉅大的漏洞一定多少可以堵塞的。必得先堵塞這由涓涓不息而成的洋貨狂潮，中國脆弱的工業方始有來蘇之望。</p>
<p>話也得說回來，國家是人民的，少用洋貨也不能全靠政府出力。如果上下一心，共同努力，庶幾中國工業既倒的狂瀾可挽，故「愛用國貨運動」，終究應當由大家去實踐。我國近百年來，迭遭外患，國際地位一落千丈，而通都大邑，人民常與外人接觸，無形之中，養成羡洋媚外的疏理，民族的自尊與自信，幾早蕩然無存，尤其在上海，時髦人物最好全盤「西化」，一律「洋式配備」，恨不得自己本人，也能變成「碧眼黃髮」。這樣現象，在抗戰之前，尚不足怪。但勝利以後，中國的國際地位，應與往日不同，在經濟上也在應努力振興工業，趕造國貨，方能與四強并駕齊驅，愛用洋貨的心理，宜可轉變。可是工業復員，既無計劃，接收標賣又擾攘至今，不但為民族工業奠定基礎談不到，而且現存的工厰也有淪為一堆廢銅爛鐵的可能。再加以政府的財政政策和外匯政策，似乎只能鼓勵工商界向外國訂購機器，反將吃到閉門羹。此在政府為失策，而在人民乃又恢復其嗜用洋貨的劣根性。誰為為之，孰令致之？假使今天大家還不覺悟，政府和人民還不趕快痛改前非，將來噬臍及！</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十七日電〕聯合國管制日本委會中·英·蘇代表今日通過日本農村兩年改組計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十七日電〕今日盟國管制委員會會議中，中國及英國代表附和美國意見，反對蘇聯之建議。按蘇聯前提議將日本較大之田產沒收，只給與半値或甚至無値，然後將此等土地分配與農民，作爲前所建議之日本土地改革運動之基礎。</p>
<p>開會以後，美國代表艾其森即宣讀一預先準備之聲明，批評五月二十九日蘇方所提之此項建議。艾氏略述美方之態度稱：「任何不依値付價而改變其土地或其他資產所有權之建議，俱與波茨坦宣言之精神不合。此種建議且與鼓勵並加强日本國内民主傾向之原則相背，因彼等係與民主之原則相背也。」艾氏强調稱：麥帥決心將土地作下列原則之分配，即耕者有其田，並取消一切地主之封建統治勢力。</p>
<p>艾其森之聲明宣讀以後，中國代表稱：彼贊同英國之修正辦法，即四國，本州，及九州各島之自耕農所有田地最高不得超過七畝半，北海道較　瘠地區則最高不得超過二十五畝。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表團旋即另作一新建議，但建議中仍主張無値沒收其數階級之土地。艾其森立即表反對，中國及英國代表亦支持艾氏立場。</p>
<p>會議向麥師所作之建議，將爲將大土地分劃成較小田區，然後以貸款辦法售與農民。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社法國貝　十六日電〕本日係戴高樂將軍　履國土二週年紀念日，此間舉行慶祝典禮，戴高樂將軍身着茶褐色少將軍裝參加盛典，民衆均向之歡呼。當渠在無名英雄墓前　致花圈之後，即前往兩年前車返祖國之處樹立石碑，用以紀念貝葉城之解放。碑文云：一九四四年六月十四日，貝葉居民重獲自由，民族解放者戴高樂將軍即在此自由地方初次發表演說。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十六日電〕戴高樂得人民共和黨擁護，重入政治舞台，共產黨即於今日聲明反對溫和派人民共和黨領導之任何政府。戴高樂之政見，係在貝華城紀念其本人一九四四年重臨故土二週年紀念之慶祝會中發表，打破其半年來之政治　默。戴氏主張以廣大之行政權賦予超越黨派之國家元首；使成爲法蘭西之總統，設立兩院制讓會及强有力之行政機關，以保衛民主。據稱：獨　之威脅仍存於法國，新制憲議會應將行政，立法，與司法三權嚴格分淸。戴氏並提及本年一月問辭去臨時總統一職，謂此舉係欲避免捲入政爭及貽人以左右立法之口實。戴氏此項言論，其有重大政治影響，其所建議之憲法，幾與人民共和黨所主張者相同，與共產黨則絕對相反。共黨所主張者爲院制議會及毫無實權之行政機關。</p>

<p>問，「領袖雜誌」近載錫蘭某作家之文，内稱：「蕭伯納君曾謂　若　愛爾蘭人，或當取得　閘　。」請光生解釋何以擇定錫蘭？答，余喜歡錫蘭之地方及人民，此乃第一個深刻之印象。西方人月光認爲錫關人實爲創世主之嫡系產品，適與大量生產之西方暴徒相反。</p>
<p>問，「領袖　誌」又謂，「當大作「意外　島之愚人」一劇在哥倫坡以錫蘭演員演出時，其受人歡迎，遠在任何大作在杜柏林演出時之上，何也」？答，觀衆之擁護爲一種事實，不能以理解之，請詢該文作者。</p>
<p>民族衝突自謀妥協</p>
<p>問，錫蘭之辛加利斯多數民族與泰米爾斯少數民族時有衝突，試問有何解决辦法，答，彼等必須自謀妥協，若蘇格蘭人英格蘭人及俄人等所爲者然。或若愛爾蘭之主天敎徒與清敎徒之妥協然，不然，即當互鬥至消滅爲止，此乃不可能之事。</p>
<p>問，在　爾生所著「蕭伯納」一書中，先生會謂前印度敎主克里許那慕蒂，爲先生生平所見最美貌之人，渠除貌美之外，尙有何項言論？答，渠拒絕成爲「東方之星」，乃異常聰明之舉動，彼等極受尊重之人，毋須再　　論之表揚。</p>
<p>印度宗敎需要改良</p>
<p>問，赫思萊所著「時間必須有」，莫根所著「剃刀之邊」等書，含有印度宗敎思想，先生是否認爲係英國文學之好現象？答，是極好之現象，可使英國文學家運用思想，向不僅從事於狂呼口號。惟印度之宗敎亦有需要改良之處，例如寺院裝飾，均嫌太具低淺意味。</p>
<p>問，光生對英國近代詩，有何感想？答，余未曾讀過近代詩，實因年齡太高之故，詩人中於莫理斯以後，余僅知梅斯費爾特一人。</p>
<p>問，當印度自由以後，英印文化是否能有　密切之關係，此項關係是否與英國民族有利？答，此兩民族欲求樹立更密切之關係，爲期尤遠，我想先生意欲使我發表詳盡之演說，先生必希望無疑，再會。</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里十六日電〕國大黨對於英國所提設立臨時政府之建議，至本週三或可有最後決定，甘地曾謂該次建議，光與明黑暗之成份各半。國大黨對於該項建議書之意見，反對與贊成者亦約略相等。回敎聯盟方面以回印各其平等代表權，故已使一部份人士感覺滿意。臨時政府係由十四人組成，與國大黨所要求之十五人相差無幾，而少數民族代表權之增加，亦係適應國大黨之要求。國大黨所提出之十五人名單中，已有十二人似已爲印度總督及英内閣代表團所接受。</p>

<p>下午一時半電行開庭。由荷爾維　檢察官繼續說明被吿歷史，繼由漢馬克檢察官對起訴書附件A之「日本政治及其他之改編爲戰時體制」，作初次陳述。指出日本領導人利用一切宣傳機關。敎育機關，　吹軍國主義，使日本人民相信滿洲爲日本之生命綫，相信向中國本部伸張日本之使命。爲在學校學生中扶植國家主義原理，被吿木戶侯爵於一九三七年將教育制度究全修改，後由荒木大將加以實行，以訓練及强制方法在靑年中注入對戰爭之熱望，對敵人之殘忍憎惡精神。除此之外，於一九三九年又開始有組織有計劃之宣傳，利用報章雜誌及一般出版物·影戲·廣播·作廣汎宣傳。凡反對此項宣傳者，則用一切方法加以壓迫，對於促進此項陰謀，警察制度曾　極大作用。被吿等之陰謀，有左列各事件足資證明：</p>
<p>（一）限制陸海軍大臣由現役陸海軍上將中將担任之，一九三六年勅令。（一）一九二九年田中內閣隨炸死張作霖事件而辭職。（一）一九三七年宇垣大將組閣之流產。（一）一九三七年米內内閣之辭職。（一）一九四一年第三次近衛內閣之辭職。（一）一九三〇年濱口首相之狙擊。（一）一九三一年之三月事件。十月事件。（一）一九三二年井上藏相及團男爵之暗殺。（一）五一五事件。（一）二一六事件。（一）一九四〇年大政翼贊會之誕生。（以改上造社）</p>

<p>當由檢察團方面第一個見證人美陸戰隊紐琴中校到庭作證。紐琴中校戰前曾在日本執教，現任麥帥總部敎育主任。據構，日本策動戰爭者曾利用學校，向青年灌輸狂妄之信念，妄認日本有統治東亞之「神聖使命」最後並將實現「八紘一宇」控制全世界。日本學校非但教材傾向於　武目標，更迫令學生從事野戰演習，巷戰硏究，劈刺練習及機槍實習。此種訓練，使學生飽受極端國家主　與　武主義之　陶，致學生愛護國家似醉似狂，對於權勞祗知一味自從云。東條於前數次審問時，均木然呆坐，似無動於衷，今日則俯身向前，注視見證，狀頗關切。（以上聯合社）</p>

<h3 id="c57">雙管齊下　司法軍事兩機關　同日偵訊糧貸案　三糧官先後收押　八米商除邵季高扣押外五人交保 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸案自蔣主席親頒手諭，遴派大員來滬澈查後，案情自有開展。迄昨日止，全案迨已臻最高潮階段。上午地方法院檢察處開偵查庭，傳訊涉嫌之四糧官及有關之糧貸米行八家。四糧官中，除上海糧政特派員楊錫志，留美未返；糧政處代理處務汪達人，因仍　留警備部，未出庭外，其餘田糧　長李崇年，糧政處儲運科長任星崖，均及時出庭。任星崖於偵訊後，連同米商邵季高即遭地檢處扣押。李崇年則交三百萬元現金及舖保，隨傳隨到。當由法警伴同覓保，迄昨日下午五時許，覓保手續，已將告竟時。軍事當局，即以閃電方法，將李逮捕。七時許，即移解警備總部軍法處。任星崖現雖暫押地檢處，惟聞必要時，即將若干有關糧貸之米行負責人。茲將昨日地檢處及警備總部軍法處開偵查庭經過，分述如後：</p>
<p>地檢處</p>
<p>昨晨九時許，被傳之糧商即陸續前往上海地方法院檢察處報到，最先到達者，為志豐雜糧店主徐泰元及萬昌興米行主兼萬昌米行經理萬墨林，協昌泰米行經理馮耿華等。至十時許，糧食部田糧署長李崇年（衣藏青色中山裝）亦至，未幾，調節科長任星崖（衣米色中山裝）</p>
<p>手携餅乾一袋而至。因無傳票，為法警阻於地檢處大門外，經向傳票室簽證後，始得入內。當時門禁之嚴，由此可見。至十一時正，全體證人及被告共十一人，由法警領入法庭，經吳啟華檢察官開始偵查，首先被傳訊者為李崇年，其次為任星崖，又其次為邢頌文·萬墨林等，逐一問訊，至下午一時半始畢，庭諭任星崖·邵季高（復康行經理）收押（押於馬斯南路看守所），李崇年以三百萬現金及舖保交保釋放，萬墨林·邢志剛（成豐公司經理）各以一千萬元現金及舖保，徐泰元·邢頌文（江北公司經理），顧益生（戶順泰米行店主），祝世錄（協昌泰米行店主）諸人各以五百萬元現金及舖保交保，僅萬昌新米行經現楊潤會與馮耿華無庸交保，自由返家。任·邵二人收押後，曾與記者談話。據任稱：此事於彼實屬寃枉，完全受某些報紙盲目攻擊之影響，彼如眞有舞弊貪汚情事，則社會可公斷，將其殺頭。昨日偵訊時，證人中有九人均供不識任某，故任星崖向記者喟嘆道：「我在南京有老母，上海的太太有三個孩子，為了此案，生活都將成問題，所以我出獄後，要呌</p>
<p>子子孫孫不再做官！」據稱本月廿二日即由潘科長派人囑其去京「避風頭」，至廿四日，米市場已盛傳其被捕押赴南京，但其實至廿五日始奉命去京。在京因聞地院將要傳訊，乃趕回上海，而傳票已送至南京，故未曾拿到。彼又謂汪達人明白由警備司令部奉蔣主席命於十四日下午六時關逮捕於辦公室中，而某報竟稱被逮捕於妓院之中。任為宜興人，卅三歲，住多倫路五十三號，被押後性情頗現焦灼，另一被囚者邵季高，為上海人，卅一歲，住桃源路六十三號，彼衣藍色白細條子長衫，狀甚文雅，在看守所內，頗能忍耐。</p>
<p>據地檢處某檢察官語記者，關於此次糧貸舞弊案，因其影響民生與社會關係極大，而主席亦曾手令嚴辦，故該處如偵查得有確實證據，適合於特別法之條文者，當依特別法起訴，或以軍法審理，重懲（槍斃！）以快人心云。</p>
<p>警備部</p>
<p>另方面警備司令部軍法處昨亦整日訊究汪達人，并提在押中之吳蓉生及長江公司負責人等到庭對質，傍晚復傳獲得糧貸之十四家米商。記者為明瞭當局處理該案職權之劃分，昨特走訪法處長曾昭貽氏，曾氏對於此點亦無確切之表示，僅謂揆諸此案性質，自可由軍法審訊（曾氏并當場檢示軍法條文），且目前各項證據文件，亦以本處搜集最多，故該案可能於短期內全部移由軍法審理，惟因此案牽涉太多，故偵訊情形，目前尚難發表。大約不出十日，可望水落石出云。</p>

<h3 id="c65">倡導節約·促進健康　大家吃糙米 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>吳市長曾在招待新聞界席上說，糙米比白米含有更豐富的惟他命，比白米更滋養，為什麼大家不食糙米呢；他并且向政府建議全國一律實行，把浪費在碾米上的人力與物力節省下來。我們認為這是一個可貴的建議，可是糙米與白米相比，究竟營養價值相差幾何呢？記者為此，特地到「聯總」去訪問一位營養專家。那位專家適因公事到外埠去了。一位正在忙碌地作着北方各地食物性質調查報告的陳醫生和記者交談，并遞給記者一張白米與糙米質地分析表，看了這張表，讀者當能明瞭白米與糙米之間的營養價值之距離，茲譯錄於後：（數字為百分比）</p>
<p>每一百格蘭姆米所含之熱量</p>
<p>米類　水分　蛋白質　脂肪　炭水化物　鈣</p>
<p>頭號白米　十二·二五　七·二九　〇·四六　七九·一六　〇·〇五二　三五八卡路里</p>
<p>二號白米　一四·八九　六·四八　〇·四七　七七·五三　〇·〇四八　三四八卡路里</p>
<p>二號白米　一四·二一　五·九五　〇·八二　七八·二四　〇·〇三四　三五三卡路里</p>
<p>三號白米　一〇·六五　九·五五　〇·九〇　七七·二二　〇·〇四一　三六六卡路里</p>
<p>頭號秈米　一三·七八　七·一二　〇·二六　七七·四〇　〇·〇五九</p>
<p>糙米　一六·九五　六·六八　〇·三五　七四·九八　〇·〇五九　三三八卡路里</p>
<p>由引可見糙米所含之惟他命較多，尤其是惟他命B，A與C，白米中就少得可憐。</p>
<p>最近市政會議中，并曾有禁止碾製上等精白食米之決議；礱碾以每石穀碾出糙米五斗以上為度；機碾以每石糙米碾出秈米杜米各九斗以上為度。根據外籍專家安佛來氏研究之結果，食用糙米，不僅對身體健康有益，而且在米量方面，至少可增加出百分之十至百分之十五。據這位專家的意見，碾製之糙米可分下列三種：（一）上等糙米約含稻穀百分之二，紅米百分之五，碎米百分之十；（二）中等糙米，約含稻彀百分之二，紅米百分之十，碎米百分之二十；（三）三等糙米，約含稻彀百分之三，紅米百分之十五，碎米百分之三十。糙米因為有紅皮助保護，所以煮熟時要多費時間，可是事實上，在燃料上所耗之費，不及糙米省下之費多多。因為：一，白米要比糙米多碾二三次；二，白米比糙米，耗損之重量為百分之十至百分之二十。</p>
<p>鄕下人多用石臼碾出的米比碾米機碾出的米雖化時間而營養豐富。最近市政府已命令社會局轉飭豆米業公會，禁止碾製上等白米了。并規定米之成本價格，應以穀之成本，另加碾費，運費，以及零售店間接費用等為標準。這樣看，上海人不久大槪再不能吃到上白杜米了。（鼎）</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕據臺省長官公署業訊，臺灣商雄縣境，有河流名阿公店溪，全長三十八公里，流域面積達一百五十三平方公里之廣，其中百分之八十為平原，殊具極大之經濟價值，惜以河床傾斜較緩，時易壅塞，尤以洪水期間，泛濫成災，為害尤甚。民國廿三年，曾一度釀成鉅災，淹沒面積達四千餘公頃，公私損失，難以數計，前臺灣總督府，有鑒於此，曾於民國廿五年，施行捷水道工程，但收效甚微，乃更於民國卅一年，着手大蓄水庫工程，修建攔河土壩一座，容水總量可達四千五百萬立方公尺，如能依照計劃完成，不惟可以調節水量，避免河流泛濫，且可并收灌漑及給水之功效。</p>
<p>日人此項工程，早於卅一年開始，迄卅四年初，業已完成過半，不幸去年夏季，遭受非常洪水，工程多被沖毀，我政府接收後，由臺灣省工礦處，公共工程局數度派員查勘，認為有繼續興工之必要，特設立工程處，專司其事。全部工程立費約需臺幣四千二百萬元，分三年完成，本年五月，已將堤場部份，開始動工，至主壩部份，則需俟洪水期後，始能着手，如能順利成功，不惟可以抑止洪水量百分之五十，且可灌漑六千公頃之水田，供給三萬居民之給水，國計民生，均可獲益非淺。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市政府昨晨九時舉行紀念週，出席吳市長國楨，何秘書長德奎，各局局長，各處處長曁市府職員共四百餘人，由吳市長領導行禮加儀，由工務局局長趙祖康報告，略謂：工務局從去年光復迄今，九月之間，各項主要工作以及預定設施計劃之推行狀況如下：</p>
<p>道路工程</p>
<p>本市現有道路全長約一千公里，其中柏油路約三百公里，彈石路與煤屑路各約二百公里，在敵偽時期，損毀過多，據接收時調查估計，應修補路面為三十萬平方公尺，半年來因車輛載重增加，路面不勝負担，續有摧毀，故平時養護，極感困難，九閱月來修補及新築路面與人行道計五十萬平方公尺以上，現在每月修補路面面積，約三倍於去年每月之數，已翻修完工路面如市中心之五角場，謹記路，中華路，民國路交通路，就中華路延長至飛機場一段，虹橋路，中正東路慢車道，翻修工程正在進行，為一勞永逸計，擬選擇交通要道，逐步澈底翻修。</p>
<p>拓寬路面</p>
<p>先將主要幹道開闢拓寬，原則以發展市郊交通，俾解決日前集中中區之畸形現象，除南京西路跑馬廳一段拓路工程進行尚見順利，此外如界路向西經新民路接西藏路之開闢，以及浙江路之拓寬，惟以拆屋讓路，困難重重，工程進行遲緩，惟拓寬華山路俾滬西重車軌道可以南北啣接，此項計劃，現殊屬必要，正積極籌備中。</p>
<p>拓寬徵費</p>
<p>該局為拓展道路，以市庫支細，不得不就地徵收工費，辦法已由臨時參議會議決通過，并呈行政院備案，其計算方法以受益面受益綫為區別，因地價增値面徵收受益面攤費，因市面繁榮而徵收受益綫攤費，希望市民能明瞭此項經費之目的與辦法之公允，與政府充分融合協助建設。</p>
<p>防潦防汛</p>
<p>本市地勢低窪，滬西尤甚，其先天缺點，為　州路與華山路以西水管約為十二吋，每値雨季高潮，積水不易排洩，該局已擬就整個防潦計劃，一面洩水通暢，一面防止倒灌，標本兼施，預計經費一百另四億元，需時一年以上，決非目前財力所能負担。即為治標計，亦需二十億元之多，現僅就最急需工程，先行舉辦，計費八億元，本年八月即可完工，今秋水患當可減輕。</p>
<p>橋樑碼頭</p>
<p>本市橋樑，除不能行車之小橋，大小計二百二十二座，跨蘇州河大橋十六座，市有碼頭三十五座，在浦西廿七座，均損毀甚重。九閱月來已予次第搶修，對發展浦東，亦有浦江大橋之計劃。</p>
<p>平民住宅</p>
<p>本市房荒嚴重，初擬建設三千幢，以市為支細，先在南市大木橋路興建一百五十幢，業於六月一日開始。</p>
<p>公園苗圃</p>
<p>本市已開放者十三處，九個月中遊園人數計三百五十萬人，先後成立苗圃五處，補種行道樹三千株。</p>
<p>搶修海塘</p>
<p>全部計長二十八公里，現擬擇急搶修，需費三十億元，由行政院救濟總署及市府三方平均負担，已在高橋海濱浴場南缺口先行搶修，今僅市府撥到第一期工款五億元，相差過鉅，而物價高漲，倘不能如期撥還，戔戔之數，恐難為濟。</p>
<p>趙局長又稱：本市為東方唯一大商埠，為改造并建設新上海，該局有都市計劃設計委員會之組織，聘請專家，從事研究設計，對本市道路系統，水道系統，該局均有縝密詳細測量，已完成全市一萬分之一及二萬五千分之一道路全圖，交中華書局刊印，即可出版。</p>

<p>行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會，昨日下午在該會招開小組會議，討論事項，擬在今日下午三時，假市府舉行會議席上提出，（一）各機關請求分配房屋者甚多，可供分配者次序。（二）前日僑集中地點，現下佔居之住戶，有發現以金條頂租情形，如何處置。（三）各機關前送分配房屋申請書，多未依照規定項目申報，如編制人數，復員人數，并未詳實塡註，殊難擬以分配，業已發出第二次申請書，若不按照規定，確實補報，認為自動放棄權利，擬提請大會不予分配。</p>
<h3 id="c92">頂屋市場　同羽春風得意樓。螞蟻交耳講斤頭　誰說上海房子少？問你黃金有幾條？ <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>這次勝利之後，似乎全世界都在鬧房荒，而上海刦又和倫敦紐約不同，房荒癥然　　　做生意的上　　　，於是一「頂屋市場」就應運而生了。</p>
<p>在江南一帶，提起房地產易，大家就會想到「螞蟻」。其實「螞蟻」就是房地產掮客。為什麼呌他們「螞蟻」，呢？因為，房子裏要一有了白螞蟻，樣子柱子就很快就會給牠們蛀得不可收拾。這些螞蟻靠房子維持生命，房子毀的時候，螞蟻肥了。說起來，房產掮客和螞蟻的確有些相像之處，盡管這雅篆有些刻薄，卻也頗與事實符合。</p>
<p>所謂「頂屋市場」，實在就是這些「螞蟻」的集會，嚴格說起來，這市場的組織旣不嚴密，價格也毫無準繩，與其說是「市場」，不如說「茶會」比較更貼切一點。這些茶會不止一處。生意大一些的交易，是在南京路石路口的仝羽春，生意小一點的，是南市城隍廟裏春風得意樓。集會的時間都在早晟，儘管那些「螞蟻」之中多的是癮君子，他們也會準時光臨，不大遲到。</p>
<p>生意興旺的時候，仝羽春裏會有五六桌茶客，他們閑話家常，和其他茶客并無不同之處，不過這五六桌人見得比別桌上更熟悉更知己罷了。他們非常機靈，一看見有人注意聽他們，就會突然改變話題。</p>
<p>螞蟻說話　善觀氣色</p>
<p>如果一切風平浪靜，附近沒有「形跡可疑」的人物，他們就談起生意來了。誰說上海人鑫屋少！此地就有的是房子，只要你有金條。說話時的神氣，大槪是這樣的：「龍覆理路底有一幢兩上兩下，有電話，八條物事，要快。」門牌是不肯隨便先發表的，惟恐有人去直接交涉，弄得螞蟻的佣金全付東流。這種待價而沽的房子，每天要有七八幢到十幾幢，自有專門跑腿的人，會四面八方搜集空房子情報，到「市場」上來出龍，於是螞蟻們就四出活動，交易一成功，這位跑腿的也有一點佣金可以到手。</p>
<p>比較手面大一些的螞蟻，大都是什麼所謂地產公司或什麼信託公司地產部的經理主任之類，他們手頭有的是「頭寸」，一看房子不錯，價錢不高，有時就先自己墊出款子，把這房子「囤」一下，加一點油漆，或者放一堂最廉價的傢俱進去，等到「脫手」的時候，就大有油水可嫌了。</p>
<p>格局較小的螞蟻，就靠成交時佣金，又名「一成頭」，因為佣金大槪是一成。但是，如果金條的條數實在太多，那末佣金就不到一成了。</p>
<p>佣金之外，還有「過戶」與「不過戶」之別。找房子的人當然希望能在大刻薄那邊「」過戶，以資保障，可是如果要辦這一個手續，那就又林金條了，有時是一成，有時還不止一成！</p>
<p>頂費的高低，當然要看地段，房屋大小，有無衛生設備，有無電話…而定，照現在市價，大槪在法租界門路　類的地段，一上一下假三層，有衛生設備的空房子，大槪　費六條，有電話時，大槪加一條，「佣金過戶在外」（這是最常聽到的一句話，換句話說，你愈能抬價，你自己的好處愈多）。有的時候，四條條子頂一幢房子也是有的，不過如不是地段偏僻，就一定沒有衛生設備。</p>
<p>最高紀錄·七十幾條</p>
<p>頂費最高的，據說有七十幾條之多，是南市老西門最熱鬧的六叉路口的某幾家新開銀樓。</p>
<p>但是，上海人儘客開綽，倒底有多少人能隨隨便便掏出五條六條來呢？所以，儘管市場熱鬧，成交的倒底不多，多數都是給那些所謂地產公司和信託之類造成了囤屋的機會，因為，他們可以公開登報，招攬顧客，而普通一般螞蟻，卻在當局三令五申之下，已經不敢再像以前那樣拋頭露面了。</p>
<p>我曾經問過一位和那些螞蟻很熟悉的朋友，「旣然生意如此清淡，何不跌價傾銷呢？」他說，二房東要頂費也實在自有苦衷，因為，你要頂出房子，就要保證出清房客，讓拿出金條來的人能馬上住進去。可是，三房客搬出之後，不是也要鬧屋荒了嗎？所以，那些三房客就照樣也要拿到了金條才肯走路，他要拿了這幾根金條再去頂房子。房子的頂費要五條六條，最精明的房東也至多祇有兩三條能够到手，剩下的就送給房客和螞蟻了。（平蕭）</p>

<h3 id="c110">小學課程研究座（八）　贊成小學一年級生免授算術 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>讀了本欄尚武君「小學一年級生應免授算術」一文，我感覺到他是一個精細的人，而且他對於一個小孩子的心靈和智力，都能够體察入微。他這一個建議，我非常贊成，因為我也體察過這種情形。</p>
<p>我的第二個兒子樂生，是我最理想的一個孩子，他具有天真活潑的爛漫態度，雄健可愛的體軀，和聰明過人的腦筋。他今年還不滿四足歲，還有資格去吃救濟處的配給奶粉。我因為他的腦力過人，所以在他未入學校之前，教他認字。上兩個月，我到書店裏買到一盒彩圖方格字，在我工作餘暇的時候，每天敎他四個字。這四個字，祇消我教他約十分鐘，他就熟記不忘了。而且筆畫差不多的字，如「力」與「刀」，「瓜」與「爪」，都能分得清楚，到現在已經認職了二百多字了。可是我發覺一件很奇怪的事，就是這二百多字當中，十個數目字，已經包括在內了。他除了「一」「二」「三」這三個數字沒有弄錯之外，其餘「四」至「十」這七個數字，就記得很勉強了。有時「五」字讀「七」字，「六」字讀「八」字，問他「九」字就搖頭，提醒了，過後又忘記。有一次我替他溫習，但是一問到十個數目字，他就有些「攪七念三」了，問到一個「六」字，他毫不虛偽的立即搖頭，我看見茶几上放着六隻茶杯，於是馬上靈機一動，拿起三隻茶杯問他是幾隻，又拿起三隻茶杯問他是幾隻，他答了兩個「三」的數目後，我又叫他把這茶杯三隻，加上那茶杯三隻，他還是加不上去，後來經我一隻一隻的替他加，他這才勉強地答出我所問他的一個「六」的數目來。</p>
<p>一個已經算是聰明的孩子，對於數目字的認識，尚且如此之難，又何怪乎尚武君的令郎鈴鈴對於加減法的算不出來呢！同時，我明白一個孩子智力還沒有充沛的時候，教他認字應該完全是名詞，而且是要具體的。因為具體的東西，他可以時時見到，聽到，接觸到，適合他的經驗，易於記憶，譬如我教樂生一個「鐘」字，他很容易記住，這個「鐘」字共有二十畫，比起十個數目字的畫數總和省三畫，但比起十個數目字的每一個數目字的名詞，已經近於抽象了。當你伸出三隻手指時，這叫做「三」，但是三隻茶杯也叫做「三」，甚至三座大洋房也叫做「三」，這使小孩子覺得奇異，便不容易使他記憶。我們驟然看到這個舉例，似乎世界上的孩子太笨了，難道知道人家伸出三隻手指是三，而三座水洋房就不知道是三嗎？我們要知道，孩子終歸是孩子，理解力還不及成年人。這就和比一個三角，幾何，代數，四則精通的數學大家，他到小菜場去買肉，無論那一位賣肉的小販，祇要說出要買多少，那小販就撮刀一斬，便是他所要買的斤兩數，同時價錢也不假思索的脫口而出，非常準確。這位賣肉小販，斬肉時，旣不須三角幾何證明，算價錢時，又不須代數四則寫算。如果開玩笑的話，要那數學大家去做賣肉小販，算價錢，還可以假借於紙筆，或者大動一回腦筋解決，呌他斬肉，可就要他的好看了，他不能在肉上面畫虛綫，測角度，引定理，終至把那塊肉斬得七零八落，還得不到畫斤兩。這是為了什麼？數學大家沒有斬肉的經驗，和小孩子不會做算術一樣，覺得這是奇異的。</p>
<p>因此，我造成尚武君的建議：「小學一年級生應免授算術。」最好小學一年級學生在繪畫時，或者在遊戲時，先給他一個「計數」的槪念，為將來敎授算術的準備。（蔡任衡·卅五·六·十）</p>

<p>今日之青白無疑為星東之最大勁敵，勝負之數，殊難預料，分析實力，高下者甚微，以星東之乾脆勇猛迅速純熟及最後之長力後勁，如謂可勝青白亦不無理由。惟青白之後衛可謂鐵閘兩座，中衛亦不弱於星東，則星東進攻，能否如願，亦屬問題。是以青白之前鋒能否突破星東，勝負可決，而後勁力工力，亦為今日勝負之重要因素也。</p>

<p>老太太　夢中呼兒</p>
<p>戴氏胞弟，雲林公子藏宜，在前兩天就趕來南京，今天雲林先生為記者問起太夫人是否知道戴氏噩耗時，眼淚便奪眶而出，從他的輓聯中，就可知道他悲傷的心情了。「魂歸仙霞嶺，應知老母倚　；望眼將穿，軀留石頭城，使後人憑吊，揮淚欲滴。」</p>

<h3 id="c146">全美鐵路罷工　緊張的一幕　杜魯門初試鐵腕 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 駐美特約記者朱家讓</p>
<p>本報廿六日紐約航訊</p>
<p>美國的經濟「內戰」，愈鬧愈兇。一面是物價管制與不管制之爭，平民層與大企業打得「落花流水」，一面是勞工和僱主之戰迄不稍息。這一戰範圍遍於全國，涉及各個部門，情况更天天惡化。講工業生產原都有連帶依存關係，如果一波未平，一波又起，這經濟復員大業，怎麽復得起？而况事情越來越糟，糟到上禮拜連這個巨人身上的血脈也罷起工來了！火車全部停開，車站要拉鐵門，這豈不是笑話，還成什麽事體？而事實竟是眞的這般驚心動魄！</p>
<p>現在風潮雖然已吿平息，但回首這二天罷工期間，頓使活生生的全國經濟體系，全部癱瘓，原有機能一起支解，政府面臨大試驗，社會發生大恐慌。所幸當局使出手腕，民衆一致支持，國家的利益還是勝過了階級的利益，結果兩位七十多歲倔强的工會領袖終予低下頭來，承認：「總統，我們是愛國的」，（引自致總統函）火車便重新開動起來了。</p>
<p>講民主政策要把穩這回全美鐵路大罷工，可說到了工潮惡化的最高峯，但觀其演變情勢，母寗替今後的勞資糾紛開啓了一個新的階叚。這就是說，事情總有飽和的一點。美國這架大機器，自從VE，VJ以來，一直在拖拖拉拉，把生產兩字扯得太不成樣子。東西作不出，生意做不成，這樣下去，如何得了？國家雖然講民主，政策還得要把穩，於是勞工立法，改弦更張，約束工潮呼聲漸起，此其一。其次，特別是幾項主要工業及交通，政府將决不容其再有變故，以致連累其他產業停頓。大凡糾紛發生而至不可收拾，政府必用接收手叚以阻遏罷工，因爲這時如再罷工，便不啻反抗政府，政府便要立法制裁，這回鐵路罷工的失敗，固然因爲抵不住全民大衆的憤怒，實在亦是吃不消「反抗政府」的罪名。影響所至，當然會對今後工潮的趨勢，發生不錯的反應。</p>
<p>這回鐵路工潮演變的本身，事情也够曲折離奇，可當一　喜劇看。就工潮的經過說，醖釀當然也非一朝一夕，遠自去年七月，全國鐵路二十個工會即已提出加薪每天二元五角之要求，同時並要修改四十五起的工作規章，目的亦使收入增加。當局依鐵路勞工法第一步由他們直接談判，不成；第二步居間調解，不成；第三步在今年一月間付仲裁，也不成；於是第四步，由總統任命事實調查會調查實況，　　方案，結果據擬議是工資應該每天加給一元二角八分，（即每時加一角六分）工作規章另行商議，但是這個辦法並不爲工會所接受，談判陷於破裂，工會定期罷工。</p>
<p>大罷工　全國人心震動</p>
<p>政府對於近來的工潮應付是確够頭痛的，尤其杜魯門總統身繫萬鈞之重，雖有勞工部長專家顧問，囊同處理　事情究亦棘手。特別這次兩位工　首腦，態度强硬，調解非常　難。當第一次罷工日期將至，總算賣了一下面子，展了五天的期；但這五天之間，情勢進展還比「牛步化」都不如。總統最後發佈了接收命令，同時提出了加薪每小時一角八分半的成例，把修改規章的事且擱一年再說。無奈其他十八個工會雖已接受，而這個火車工人及機車工人兩個兄弟會領袖依然不聽，且很直率而輕慢無禮的回覆總統說：「我們已迭次吿訴你了，工人們現在十分憤慨着。他們的要求是不能拒絕的……所以你的建議不能接受。」全國的火車，就這樣停頓下來了，時間是五月二十三日下午四點鐘。</p>
<p>全美鐵路三百四十八幹綫，凡二十二萬八千英里，逢到有史以來破天荒第一遭的「休息」，全國的經濟生活馬上碰到了深刻嚴重的威脅。所有工廠原來都在冥頑不靈，索性一齊關門。都市的　糧燃料，平日全靠火車運載，此時也斷了來源。還有幾十車善後物資正要運赴海外救命，弄得動也動不得，又是急得死人。再加旅客裹足，商業凍結，（據統計：平時全國火車乘客每年計四萬五千萬人，平均每人火車旅行三次强。倘在我國恰合每人每年一次。（這塲暴風雨確是切實打進了每個人的心坎，全國騷然震動，影響當然非同小可。</p>
<p>各部門　應變沉着有方</p>
<p>在此，我們有値得注意應該儘先一說的第一，我們先從政府當局說，暫置總統府的措施不談，各有關主管部門的準備，以及他門這種臨事應變的沉着有方，是値我們欽佩的。從罷工開始起，無綫電裏就連續宣布着政府國防運輸部的應變辦法，一切運輸立採優先制，何者先運，何者停運，一切可以徵調的空運及水運工具，儘量集中候命。郵政當局的應急辦法，把一切信件俱用空運，同時限制包裹寄遞，重若干磅，大多少呎，也是條理井然。再則地方政府也隨即分別曉論民衆，勸導鎭靜，並說本市的食糧燃料短期內不致匱乏，一面已開放某處某處大橋地道，一面已厚集長途汽車，使住居郊區市民改以代步等等。足見他們的手脚並不慌亂，樣樣都有準備。第二，講民間，當然内心都焦憂，却是態度多鎭定。他們儘管不滿意工會此舉，但分析事理比較淸楚。他們要跟自已的議員說話，會向報紙投書，不少人對杜魯門總統應付稍嫌軟弱，送進白宮要求採取行動的函電之多，據說自他　事以來所未有。第三，說一說工人本身，罷工原是自己表决的，自然一致行動，但是這樣徒苦大衆，究非初意，於是有些高級一些的工人，穿起便服自願駕駛往返市郊數回，以接送職業男女，固然次數很少，惟可見他們這種獨有的作風。至於罷工之後，車站門可羅雀，當屬必然，工人並不組起糾察隊，這是因爲　路旣被接管，暫屬政府所有，工人如來糾察依法立遭　捕之故。</p>
<p>白宮裏　憤怒吼聲大作</p>
<p>以上是段　話，接下來就應說到這回杜魯門總統初試鐵腕的一幕了。是罷工的第二天晚上，正當國會熱辯制止罷工法，無線電評論員在空中大肆口舌　難工潮，總統在白宮辦公室裏陡然叫出憤怒的吼聲了。從最近的電影上，看出杜總統嚴　而疲　的神色，從這晚的無線電裏，更覺總統的聲調是低沉而略帶沙音，可想像其憂勞如何。但是這晚的演說，明晰有力，誠摯感動，同時恩威並施，終予贏得全國大衆的擁戴與罷工工人的回頭。</p>
<p>杜總統那天演說的要旨，是報吿處理經過，判明責任所繫，同時剖述此事利害，限令工人復工。他第一說明此番罷工性質，純爲反抗美國政府，第二說明政府不能自暴弱點，即應積極應付，第三解釋罷工影響國内國外人民生命健康，責任全在這二個工會領袖。於是末了，他頒發一個二十四小時的哀的美頓，限令翌日下午四時全體復工，否則派軍行車，以維交通。總統自承爲工人之友，彼前任參議員時，一向爲工人說話，但此次妄舉，不能容忍。尤其對這兩個工會領袖，嚴詞斥責不稍寬假。以這次事件譬諸珍珠港　　，惟　竟出自國内此少數人之私利。總統這回稀有的　怒，實在代表着大多數人民的同感，事情乃這般急轉直下而戲劇化起來。第二天早上，其餘十八個工會代表十二萬工人首先簽了字，接受總統一角八分半的條件，那兩位工會領袖也　即致函總統，願再談判。可是那路總統不理了，他要準備下午召開國會參衆聯席會演說，要求緊急立法，工會無奈，至此只有自承失敗，照總統條件全部簽認，立允復工，這時正巧杜總統已在國會內慷慨陳詞，頓時雨過天靑，喜劇於此結束。</p>
<p>緊急法　表現國家第一</p>
<p>不過，鐵路工人雖已復工，煤　工潮尙在相持，總統的緊急立法，要求有權取締若　經政府接收而仍罷工反抗政府之行爲，同時得遣送工人從軍，一面希望國會，硏訂根本方案，以加强勞工政策，保障人民生活。國會的掌聲同時發自共和黨員，交織成空前熱烈的一片，表現這個國家一般意嚮所趨，已經很成熟而明顯了。這一次也許告訴你擾攘已久的工潮，應該可吿段落了。再則，由於這回鐵路的風潮，復可知人民的自由儘管不可侵犯，民主的原則無可搖撼，而國家依然至上，勞動羣衆的利益，還不是第一位；全體大衆的利益，才是第一位！</p>

<p>本報紐約廿五日航訊　特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>白宮裘邊最忙的人有三個：羅斯是其中之一，好幾百的大小小的記者，要好好對，本就不是一件容易事。第二個忙的是總統的顧問史蒂曼，他是被總統指定的：和勞資雙方代表會商的人，我知道好幾次，鐵路員工的意見書，都是由史蒂曼轉陳給總統的。第三個忙人，當然就是總統自己了。</p>
<h3 id="c148">白宮三忙人 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>罷工運動的中心人物有二位，也是新聞記者羣相包圍的對象，一位是火車司機工人的領袖瓊斯頓，高個子，瘦長的臉，一位是路員的領袖魏特南，一個軀幹結實的中年人。這兩位民主國家的「獨裁者」，現在是美國最有權威的人物，他們的一句話，一個命令，就操縱着美國幾千萬人來來往往的交通，以及由運輸而影響的物價。</p>
<p>但是，瓊斯頓自己對我說：他不過是二十五萬鐵路工人的一個『轉達者』而已，他沒有權把工潮平息，也沒有權把工潮無中生有的推動起來：他說：美國的工人多了，經濟問題和經濟糾紛也跟着複雜起來，『和中國比起來，當然是大不相同的了』。我望着他瘦長的影子，　在白宮的花園裏，微微抖動。</p>
<p>政府接管全國鐵路的命令，是杜魯門總統離開白宮前一天下的。一位美國的同業吿訴我：當時大家對政府接管的期望很高』，其實，所謂『接管』原本是暫時的。資本家（鐵路公司的老　）說：『我不能答應勞方的條件，如果我答應了，我就得虧本』。勞工說：『如果這條件不照辦，我無法生活』，因此，根據憲政的慣例，在這種兩難的局面之下，才有所謂政府暫時接管的辦法，政府旣然接管，負責的人，也得打一打算　，政府不是資本過剩的人，那有錢平白賠本？旣不能平白賠本，問題就多了。杜魯門總統回白宮那天，第一個大決策，是提高鐵路員工的薪金，原先鐵路公司答應的每天加薪一元二角八分，總統決定再增二角，改為每天加薪一元四角八分。但是勞工毫無反響，原因是問題的　結，不在加薪，而在於服務辦法的改善。</p>
<p>路員和　機工人對這四十五點的辦法，意思非常堅決。從總統　華盛頓的星期一談商開始，一直到罷工爆發，談商毫無結果。</p>
<h3 id="c149">「孤島」紐約 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>我是鐵路開始罷工的前一天（二十二日）回紐約的，臨走的時候，各方面觀察，都不致有結果。深恐一旦羅工開始，向不到紐約，阻在華盛頓，也是無聊。到紐約以後，才知道公共汽車已經</p>
<p>二十三日下午四點鐘，紐約第三十四街的賓夕法尼亞車站，眞是一個了不起的境頭。車站大廳的鐵門倐然關閉了。警察在四週帶武裝的。鐵門外擠得人山人海，有的閒着沒事來看熱鬧，有的扶老携幼，箱籠行李，還不知道罷工這回事，存心來搭火車的，一到車站，才知道火車出了事。幾十列機車和車皮，靜靜的躺在站上，路員和工人們，早就溜之大吉。</p>
<p>無綫電連續廣播出大罷工的消息，報紙呌賣了號外。紐約市民帶着半驚半奇的心理，注意着事件的發展。在紐約，現在最流行的一個字，便是『孤島』。『紐約成爲孤島了』，杜威州長對紐約人民廣播，開頭第一句就如此說。</p>
<p>當然，孤島最嚴重的問題是「糧食」，紐約市，不，紐約全州的糧食，都是靠中西部來補給的，肉類也是如此。火車一斷絕，問題就多了。杜威州長和奥祖華市長的意思，唯一的補救對策，是動員所有的汽車和飛機，來挽救這一個危局。</p>
<p>先例是有的，那是在一九二二年，全國鐵道有過一次總罷工。但不是政府接收了才罷工的。政府接管鐵道，在第一次歐洲大戰時，曾經試行過。但一等到凡爾賽和會開成立刻發還給公司了。</p>
<p>由政府宣佈接管，而結果還是罷工的，恐怕這是第一次。電車上，一位老太太憤憤地吿訴我：「杜魯門總統毫無能力，把美國弄成這步田地」！電車從九十六街轉到赫特遜河岸，我望着赫特遜河滔滔的流水，想起杜魯門總統在白宮花園内安祥的步伐，想起他看着這紛亂如　的國事，內心潛伏着的焦急，感覺到唱半齣壓軸戲，確是不容易的！</p>

<p>編者先生：最近江蘇省敎育廳頒發敵僞中等學校畢業生甄審登記表格，甄別一般敵偽中等學校畢業生，辦法至詳，並須作一篇「三民主義閱讀報吿」，我們對此原則，絕對贊成，唯辦法似有不妥。（一）單塡這一表格，以爲甄審標準，則胡亂瞎塡，當局未必能洞察實情。同時所繳納的證件，也不能作爲鐵石憑證。大家知道的，敵偽時什麼事情都是黑幕重重，教育界何能例外？出一點錢，請一次客，弄一張畢業文憑，也眞易如反掌。如此這般，試想登記時各生繳納的證件，豈可作爲甄審之標準？（二）關於作一篇「三民主義閱讀報吿」，這一件事情，我們想想看，各生登記當然希望合格，由是該文卽求他人助作，甚至竟然代作，連謄寫也求之他人，簡直全然虛僞，當局又怎能明察秋毫？（三）審局對敵僞時的師範畢業生也與前者視同一例，我們認爲師範生學歷固屬要好，而更重要的乃是經騐。經騐豐富學歷欠佳的執敎者，其敎育時亦未必盡是事倍功半。今日公敎人員生活淸苦，誰也知道。今日旣在執敎的敵僞時的師範畢業生，他們熱烈的服務心，値得人家欽佩的，當局何以這般苛刻？鄙人認爲最好的甄審辦法，是來一次集體的甄別試騐，以此時的成績作爲標準，諒必正確得多吧。同時，我以爲甄審後，不及格的（不論師範生或其他中學生）要給以訓練。我國正當復員建設伊始，各部門正缺乏人才去工作，當局對此一般靑年，難道肯忍心放走嗎？讀者袁嘯敬上，六·八。</p>

<p>上海法商水電公司，對於收取用戶的水電費，向來是技巧高妙。在租界未收回以前，法商水電價，總是比之英商，閘北，華商等爲高。自儲備劵發行以二作一收取法幣，乃借口增收用戶一筆保證金，前年九月起，又巧立名目，徽取用戶所謂「養表費，」其數目視表量大小，最低每月水表電表各收二十五元，後來屢增爲各收四十元，八十元，到日本投降時，漲到最低每月每表各收二百五十元，直到改用法幣，法商仍維持着養表費的名目。今年一月份起，始由公用局發見，着令取消這巧立名目的養表費，這對用戶自是德政。可是法商公司豈肯甘心，於是又憑他們巧妙的手法，在每月自來水帳單上，添一欄叫「補足最底（底字是原文）之數，」意思就是除正帳外還得再要收一筆額外費。究竟什麽是最底數，用戶終始無法知道，反正無論你用到若干度，終須再白添出幾度的費用就是了。今年四月起，法商水價每度已由五十元漲爲一百二十元，但補足最低之數仍舊在加收。希望公用局當局，注意該公司這種不合理的行爲。我頗懷疑，難道法商公司對於公用局員工的用戶，可以免此一項額外費用嗎？否則何以他們竟不知道而不去糾正？　黃白虹上</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>朋友從東京帶來了一冊書刊——「東京·一九四五年秋，」是日本文化社出版的，印刷得很精美，猩紅色封面封底，十分刺激！</p>
<p>我讀完了所有全部圖片，我讀出這本書隱在圖片裏面的兩個主題—「佔領軍的威勢」和「東京的貧苦。」而由這兩個主題所告訴日本他們本國人民的是什麽，自然不　可喻了。、</p>
<p>比如，其中有「四谷見附（地名）的佔領軍的　路標」「丸之內明治保險公司門前的吉普陣容」——；比如，其中有「從淸洲橋看人形町之殘跡」，「電車站候車行列」「地攤風景」「西鄉隆盛銅像下的露宿者羣」，「淺草本願寺境內無家之人」，「池　　附近之父女」……</p>
<p>從廿六年八月十日離開東京以來，屈指已近九年，這個都市曾經寄托了我少年的夢，如今，這戰後的東京面目，放在眼前，難禁神往的。駿河台，市个谷，有樂町銀座；敷寄屋橋上可以垂釣，日本劇塲前排滿了人力車行列，一個異國人也是不堪想像的。</p>
<p>最理解日本的兩位前輩—蔣百里和王　生，可惜都先後逝世了，他們如健在，他們會吿訴我們日本人準備怎樣波過最近這五年，以及最近這五年內日本將怎樣。</p>
<p>全日本現在沒有第二個口號，有的是「建設」，唯一的一個口號；「建設」。蔣王二位老先生雖歸道山，這本畫册却爲我解答了上面兩個問題。</p>
<p>我們家鄕，有偸油吃的耗子變而爲蝙蝠的傳說，這傳說雖是不科學的，但意義倒很深。</p>
<h3 id="c156">耗子 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡壬侯</p>
<p>半夜醒來，『蟋蟋蟋蟋」地在房間裏嚮着耗子的聲音。</p>
<p>這聲音非常討厭，簡直使人不能再熟睡下去，第一怕它咬壞那口僅存的破箱十，第二怕它咬破床下的皮鞋，其次有一塊洗衣用的肥皂沒有收到匣子裏去，生怕又被它拉走。</p>
<p>漸漸地身體裏流積着憤怒，一個「虎跳」從床上翻起來；等穿上了鞋，擦亮了燈，老鼠們早已跑得精光了；所謂打一早驚蛇，一個人在此時，對於一隻耗子簡直無技可施。怎麼辦呢，祗有採取守勢，把一切可能要被老鼠侵善的東西，全部收拾在較安全的地方；等到再吹熄了燈，回到床上去的時候，已是全無睡意了。</p>
<p>這樣，我同老鼠不免有了仇恨。在白天，也往往看得見耗子從陰溝裏偷偷爬出來，畏縮的目光，尖起的鼻子，它東嗅西嗅地爬到一點偶爾落下的飯粒上去。我便冷不妨地大吼一聲，嚇得它直滾進洞裏，算是阿Q樣地報了仇了。</p>
<p>我們家鄉，有偷油吃的耗子變而爲蝙蝠的傳說，這傳說雖是不科學的，但是其意義倒很深；它反映了社會上一種現象，便是偷吃了「油」，就有辦法；在老鼠，它可以變成能飛的蝙蝠，直上靑霄；在人呢，那偸油，揩油的，誰不是腦滿腸肥，踏上社會的最高峰。記得有一個縣政府的小科負，初中尙未畢業，不知怎一樣混進了縣政府，包了幾年「斗息」，敲了幾年老百姓的竹槓，在偸油揩油之後，旣然腰纏萬貫，油頭粉面，每天西裝革履，賣弄神氣，自以爲是現社會的一等人物，便是耗子偸汕，能得飛黃　邊的一個最好例子。</p>
<p>最近讀科學報吿，有人硏究耗子的壽命。說是最多三年。大約一隻耗子每活十天，等於一個人活一年；所以它活三年，等於人們活了八九十歲了，壽亦不可謂不高矣。當我們）　每看見一隻禿毛爛尾的耗子從洞裏蹣跚地出來時，我們也難免對它要發生出一點憐憫的心，因爲它委　老了</p>
<p>耗子們是怕貓的。平常家養的貓可以分爲三類：一類是有貓的威風而無貓的本領的，耗子們見了當然害怕，事實上它也只可以嚇嚇耗子們而已，其餘一無所能；這也許有點像學校中的主任之類，威風十足，硬逼　學生剃光頭，恨不得呌學生的頭髪連頭皮都剃掉，並且不許在烈日下戴帽子，以便下下表示訓育的成功</p>
<p>第二類貓，是既無威風又無本領，卻有一股媚態，時時　　　地躲在主人的腳邊好吃懶做。它既不會捕耗子，而且也認不得什麼呌做耗子；當然耗子們也不會怕它；它也落得不管閒事，悠悠然也爲其人間的寵兒。</p>
<p>最後一種貓，可以說是貓的眞種，它旣有威風也自然有本事。耗子們遇見了它，早已被嚇得骨酥腿軟，心服情願地等它來一口吞下去。</p>
<p>我有一次看見一隻餓貓，被人家拴在門口，却不知怎樣地被它捉住了一隻耗子。我看着它一口一口地把耗子吃完。先吃頭內臟便從頭子中流出來，就吃內臟臟，以後再吃身子；最後剩下一條尾巴，我以爲它不要吃了，誰知它一看再看之下，覺得放着似乎總有點不妥，便又把這尾巴吃下，我心裏佩服極了，這樣的英雄，眞乃我們動物界的榮幸！</p>
<p>耗子和貓是「世仇」，但是耗子們從來不知道報仇的。對付貓，它只有兩個辦法，一個是「逃」，另一個便是「不抵抗」，　「心服情願」，「任人擺佈」。</p>
<p>然而硏究動物學的人，則知道得很明白，耗子與耗子之間，卻很少有和平的。它們見了同類，便互相尖起鼻子，突牙怒目扭打起來。甚至把對方的屍體，也吃個精光。我有一回做過一次實騐。捉着了一隻老鼠以後，把一種毒藥呌做靝酸鉀的給它吃下去，然後放它回巢。</p>
<p>幾天之後，老鼠們都不見了，挖開地板來看，發現五六具耗子的屍首，原來他們是貪食了它們同類的肉，連帶彼毒斃的。</p>
<p>然而耗子們雖是膽怯，自相殘殺，還做出種種亡族滅種的行爲，所幸其生殖力特別大，在哺乳類中簡直罕見，一年能生產四回，每回四頭到六頭不等。試想兩隻耗子，一年之後能化出十六隻到二十四隻之多，何怪大下滔滔者皆是，我們之中誰能高枕無憂呢？</p>

<p>澳門是中山的一個出海口，實際上，是去香港的一個埠頭。它估地不多，經了葡人好幾百年的經營，也祗略其一個近代城市的規模而已。」七七」之後，國人在那兒加强了好些建築，便把它的面目裝得又像樣一些；這祗能和中山的石岐來一個比較，說香港和廣州，就又落後多了。我向少出門，對出生地的中山，固然很是陌生，對於曾經過路過的澳門也並沒有甚麼印象。倒是我的從兄對它却有獨好，特從太平洋上的夏威夷島回到那兒長期居住，可是，他的家，就因他的獨好而在那兒傾了。爲的是它被人稱爲東方的蒙的卡羅。</p>
<p>八年前的秋天，我在澳門逗留過兩日和兩個整夜，頭一夜，旅館的一個侍役特地走進房來介紹我去「楂楂攤」。我茫然問是怎一回事？由他的解釋，才知介紹我去享樂一個剛被人享了「初夜權」的女人。這句隱語使我聽了覺得甚爲新穎，祗是自己是正在失魂喪魄的當兒，而腰包也僅能使我有兩頓「打店」的餘裕，着實不能够領受他的盛情，却因此而在當時遭受了那侍役的白眼。第二夜，我做起一個不花錢的嫖客來，我的哥哥的一位朋友請我到新街的一家妓院玩了幾圈麻雀，眼看人家抽了好些大燜。等到盛筵大開，我初次嘗到西洋白酒，席散之後，人家在滅燭留髡，我又在街心上看到兩排短門之內的奇景，顯然與京滬平津的有很大的分別和異樣。以後，我又會到過兩回，都是暫短的逗留，很可惜沒福去「樓上吊　」僅在一個下雨的黃昏從公園走上萬松山，再從萬松山走下南環，領略一些雨中的海景。</p>
<p>在我的直覺裏，澳門是一個藏垢納汚的地方，地方不大而却有不少腥臭薰大的馬路，我齠齡時在鄕，看過好些鄕人去過澳門，去了不多天，便要乘着山轎回鄉來，據說他們的身上帶回不少水菓，饞嘴的我，曾跟一位鄉人去過，不想水菓沒要到，耳括子却給打得頭昏限花，自後才不敢向人去要。然而，小心靈上早就孕着澳門是人身上生水菓的出產地了。</p>
<p>偶讀吳墨井盡跋，他對於澳一門曾有如下的記着：</p>
<p>「奥門一名濠境。去奥未遠，有大西小西之風馬。其禮文俗尙，與吾鄉倒行相背；如吾鄉見客，必整衣冠，此地見人，免冠而已，若夫書與盡亦然，我之字，以點盡　　而成，然後有音，彼先有　，而後有字，以勾　排　橫視而成行。我之畫、不取形似，不落窠臼，謂之神逸，彼一以陰陽，向背，形似，窠臼上用工夫；即款識，我之題上，彼之識下，用筆亦不相同，往往如是，未能殫述。</p>
<p>「李義山每歎九州恨此生未酬，作詩云：「海外惟聞更九州，他生未卜此生休。」予將至　，榜人手指，乃知李詩中之九州，第九點青螺，相去咫尺，前波飛渡，無能衝人，憑舟望之，海氣微氣徵茫，或　呀現，如浮鷗然。</p>
<p>「濠四無阡陌，有石沙，有土甚瘠，居人不諳事春耕，爲商賈者多；不樹桑，婦亦不知蠶事，全身以紅紫花錦覆披，微露眉目半面；有凶服者用皂色。其男子拳髮披肩，戴帽如笠，見人則免之；服短毳衣，兩袖甚窄，衣之中間四旁，多鈕扣，着革屐，只一齒。兩腰間橫長短二劍，手執籘枝者，却是官也。」</p>
<p>吳墨井爲事國淸初六大畫家之一，與王　，石谷同學，後逃避王石谷之迫，浮海至澳門，便終老於比。他對澳門的印象，根據上錄的三則，可見他當時所引起的興趣是如何地存着俗尙不同的驚異。但在現在我們看來，便了無甚稀奇之處了。至我對於澳門，則講其如此一個齷齪而四不象的城市，至今還擁有不少華人的游資。</p>

<p>間名士楊了公先生，風流惆憊，曠絕塵實，而好義急公，爲近世所罕觀。民十六年冬先生以六三之年，應江蘇省主席之聘，出宰上海浦東某縣，下車伊始，即倡地方自治，用人行政，悉以民意爲依歸，首創民衆日報，開放輿論，建設水陸交通，使用民力而不勞民財，平訟息爭，全縣翕服。先生平素喜親訪民間疾苦，有時入茶肆與民衆共話，事無鉅細，廉得其情，輒自撰佈吿張通衢，現身說法，羣驚其神。其禁煙賭，自士紳傑　者始，不變小民，身教所被，民風丕變，治事三月，不及一私。</p>
<p>其時作者執敎滬濱，寒假回省，除夕陽雪，以弟子禮謁先生於縣府明倫堂，入室見先生作詩曰：「今年除夕債尤多，曾未一聲喚奈何，了理送窮鬼去，明年安樂有行窩。」擱筆相視而笑，並問有錢買蜜棗一斤請客否？蓋先生喜甜食，余適携有新購徽貢耳。旋以一紙授余曰歸與尊翁同讀，不得先看，待與家君　視，則「請君辭職，我亦云矣，」八字耳。先生在官三月，去之日，正農新年，縣府同人，例有團拜之舉，熱鬧間，不知先生悄然離云矣。</p>
<p>先生中年始號了公，以其了餘公也。先生本雲間望族，有田數十頃，以其了公悉皆售去。會憶某年七省水災，朱子橋貽書先生，以急切不得欵，乃典田百畝助之。先生一身作善，結晶則為手創之松江孤兒院，今日院生有自大學畢業者。晚年寓上海西門路三慶里之朱宅，鬻書生涯，怡然自得。自挽曰：「家庭鰲賊，社會功人，」頗有廉吏不可爲之意云</p>

<p>杜魯門總統在六月初，曾經透露一點關於史太林健康的消息。史氏的身體欠佳，所以不能訪問美國。他不適於空中旅行，乘上飛機就有耳鳴的徵象，心臟也不舒服。</p>
<p>美總統曾經兩度約史太林，到美來做一次「社會訪問」。第一次邀請，是在去年七月，柏林會議將結束的時候。第一次，是在上月外長會議中，由貝爾納斯吿莫洛托夫。兩次，史太林都以身體欠佳謝絕了。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統正預備把他所收藏的小戰利品，捐助給西點軍校博物院。同時，他很喜歡把他所收藏的小玩意兒。指點給來訪他的客人們看。尤其是一柄日太人切　　長劍，刀鞘上有兩把匕首，是十七世紀時的遺物。</p>
<p>英國的屋荒，也很嚴重，一般人民，對政府的造屋速度，頗感不滿。雖然政府已經決定每年造屋五十萬幢，比戰前的三十六萬幢增加許多，也還是需要五年時間，總能完成二百五十萬幢房子的需要。</p>
<p>最近兩個月來，據羅馬旅客的經騐，飯店黑市的餐價已减低了百分之五十，一則是因爲海外食物輸人的增加，其次，是因爲國內菜園子已有出品上市。目前，一餐豐盛的餐飯，的計美金四元。</p>
<p>美國製片家角逐「羅斯福傳」的攝製權本極激烈，最近各方似皆偃旗息鼓，暫時放棄，因爲無法找到一個適當的，飾演羅斯福的人物。</p>
<p>本月初有三千名美國兵調防到柏林，黑市的香烟價狂瀉，從一千六百馬克（合一百六十元美金）一箱，跌到一千二百馬克。因爲美國G．I有大批香烟「出籠」也。</p>
<p>瑞士朱里克的萊諾湖畔，有一所學校，時做「人性學校」，它是荒漠般的歐洲敎育界的一塊綠洲。這裏有四十個學生，學習理智和寬容的課程。學校的校長是一位七十五歲的德國老敎育家。它原設於德國黑森林，納粹當權以後就被搬到瑞士來。</p>

<p>號稱「五金大王」之張蓮舫，於本月七日首度由高院提訊之時，曾由其報攝影記者前往拍照，攝畢出庭時，其家屬尾隨於後，堅請其勿將照片刋登報端，並利誘之曰：「衹要答應下來，你提什麼條件都可接受，「可知張逆除「五金」之外，尙多一「金」。</p>
<p>高院審奸時，各著名漢奸答供時，往往不失其常態，如僞高院院長答供，常用「我吿訴你」之口吻，謝葆生，周邦俊則不言「被吿」，而自稱「葆生」「邦後」。更有某些漢奸，猶言「大東亞戰爭」「重慶政權」等等荒謬論調，可見奸心未！死惡魔常玉淸，即「安淸會」首領，以殺害愛國志士「著名」京滬，受審時，常絕對否認，乃法官謂「梁鴻志亦承認你做的」時，始啞口無可抗辯。常回獄後，即與梁不睦，責怪其「拖人下水」，不顧面情，大起爭執，事後惡魔對此介介於懷，「老是不開心」。</p>
<p>梁鴻志爲「維新政府」首領，常玉淸爲「黃道會」頭子，一個叛國，一個殺人，均爲「前漢」之特殊人物，據各方觀察，咸預測該二逆有最先判處極刑之可能。</p>
<p>上海監獄現囚漢奸，不下兩餘人，家屬前往送物者，每週二次，凡食物，用品，衣着，應有盡有，近頃最新式之美國玻璃太陽眼鏡，亦已在獄中發現可知，漢奸之獄中生活，猶未忘「摩登」也。至於飲食，則水果西點，無一或缺。究屬漢奸「胃口好」，抑係漢奸「好胃口」，則又令人不解矣。</p>
<p>曾響應汪逆兆銘發表艷電之曾逆仲鳴，因當時在河內即被刺身死，迄今是否漢奸，身份未明。故渠之南京房屋，成了「無頭公案」。曾逆過去在首都置有房產甚多，僅玄武湖一處，即有八幢極有精緻之洋房，另在翠明村亦有洋房十餘幢之多，建築均甚華麗。現該項房屋，由前陸軍總部，首都警察廳等機關之高級職員，向南京市府暫行租用，租金均甚低廉。聞最近有人對曾逆「究應列入何等身份」一事，表示「熱忱關懷」，並已向首都高院提出硏究，蓋曾逆雖亡，房產猶在，尙値得動一番腦筋也。</p>

<p>— 文漪</p>
<p>結婚對於人生，在有形無形兩方面，都有良好的影響。據各國調查配偶的有無和死亡率，有配偶的男女，比較同一年齡的未婚者或獨身者的死亡率常低。</p>
<p>為什麼原故，有配偶的人比獨身者（包括鰥寡者及離婚者）的死亡率小呢？先就女子說，入了結婚生活，一者可以免除無配偶者所必有的生存，競爭上的危險。二者婦人的身體，能盡產兒的天職，在進化發長的過程上，正是順應自然的事，假使不懷孕，不生產，就是不順自然的生活，在健康上，當然有不利的影響了。</p>
<p>再就男性說，每天自朝至暮，為職業而奔走，累得精疲力竭，就仗回到家庭，休養精神，恢復健康，假使家中有賢明的妻子，給你安慰，這在培養元氣上，比任何藥石有效。若沒有配偶，缺乏這種最重要的保護人，就不能得到這種安慰。而且失去家庭團聚之樂的人，不甘寂寞，就要到茶樓酒肆去消遣，輕則喪失精神，重則淪入下流，而且對於健康上也大受影響。</p>
<p>在另一方面獨身者與民族議相違，所以我說，獨身者是民族的罪人。</p>

<p>— 王煥白</p>
<p>女孩子在母親的撫愛之下，一天一天地大起來，到了相當的年齡，成熟了，對於異性感到傾慕，於是很容易發生戀愛的問題。這個問題關係女孩子一生的幸福，是十分嚴重的。如果妳是受過了新思想洗禮的人，當然是同意戀愛自由的，決不至於像過去一般人的意見一樣，要妳自己替她選擇婚姻對象；可是如果妳的女兒現在只有十六七歲，已經與她的男同學談交際了，那麼，妳將采取怎樣的態度呢？</p>
<p>或者，妳認為孩子年齡尚小，不應該就與人談戀愛，——好，我承認妳有高明的見地，足見妳是賢明的母親。不過，當妳嚴厲地責備妳的女兒，教她依從妳的意思做，我想妳多半是失敗的，也許她一反往日的溫柔恭順，表示不滿。這樣，妳有點傷心了，說孩子「變壞」，於是拼命地管束她，除了到校上課或者往親戚家玩玩之外，不許她出門一步。妳想，這麼做大槪可以達到預期的目的了，但我以為妳仍舊失敗，她也許更其不順從妳的話，也許表面上順從心裏卻氣不過！</p>
<p>根據心理學的理論，最好—妳千萬莫傷害了妳女兒的自尊心，對於她的戀愛，妳必須得表示鄭重其事，妳要在她面前多方為她考慮，切莫以母親的尊嚴來折服她，然後再把妳的意思說出來</p>
<p>女兒的戀愛問題要是妳置之不顧，委實萬分危險！但又不可一味管束，最好是取一種在旁參加意見的態度才好。</p>

<p>私生子問題鬧了千百年，法律上已有合法的規定，照理應是不成為問題的問題了。但莫泊桑小說中的悲劇，還是到處可見。可見這已不是法律所能解決的問題，而應以新的倫理道德觀念，方能獲得解決。</p>
<p>首先，我們要救年青的男女們，在談戀愛的時候，要有一定的軌範，必須謹慎些。拿理智去抑制情感的汎濫。。否則，一時熱潮的情感固已滿足，卻播下了悲劇的種籽。為了毀滅這噯昧的憑據，就不得不揑死弱小的個體。你想，世上還有比這更鹵莽，更殘忍的事嗎？</p>
<p>所以，為防止私生子所產生的悲劇，我們熱誠的要求人們珍貴青年的生命力，不要將它作鹵莽的浪費。何況愛情決不僅是肉體的滿足，為尊重男女雙方的人格，是需要用絕大的毅力去克制情感啊！</p>
<p>其次，旣然不幸而產生了私生子，當事人就應該勇敢的出來承認。好使那些無辜的孩子獲得身分的確認，千萬不要像莫泊桑小說中的父母那樣自私和懦弱。因為這行為本來談不到罪惡，不過稍嫌鹵莽罷了。那何必自己再去製造這罪惡，使良心永遠受着譴責呢！</p>
<p>社會上的一般人士，更應該改變對私生子的觀念。「我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死。」要知千萬的私生子，正因人言可畏而被殺的啊！蔑視，譏諷，這鋒銳的利刃，被殺害了千萬的生靈，我們不能漠視這血跡斑斑的事實，不該再任意使用這殺人不見血的利刃。</p>
<p>孩子是無辜的，又何關於私生與公生。人類經了這次大屠殺，已有了高度的警覺，正在覓取永久的和平。對於這個鬧了千百年的悲慘問題，也願大家拿出人類的良知來，以後再不使我們發現那些弱小的生靈被拋棄在大弄小巷和窮鄉僻壤。</p>

<p>— 虞文</p>
<p>近來讀到好些青年朋友寫作的文藝品，發現在意識方面極為正確，然在形式方面卻不能達到完美或近於完美，這使我想起了藝術的內容與形式一問題。</p>
<p>文藝作品是藝術，一件好的藝術創作，不僅要有好的內容，也要有好的形式。我們知道藝術的創作過程，簡言之，可以分作兩個步驟：第一是組合意象，第二便是表現意象。形式是意象，而內容就是意象所含蘊的意識。凡是富於理想，具有生命力的藝術創作，沒有不是旣有豐富的內容又有完美的形式的。</p>
<p>話雖如此，藝術家在創作的歷程當中，卻不能有意地把內容與形式看作是截然不同的兩物，他們原是統一而不可分的。詩序曰：「詩者，志之所之也。在心為志，發言為詩，情動於中，而形於言……」所謂動於中的「情」與形於言的「詩」，原是一而二，二而一的。於是，我們便要注意到「創作的均衡」了。</p>
<p>什麼是「創作的均衡」呢？那便是內容與形式非常調合，非常統一的作品。這樣的作品，在內容與形式方面是得到「均衡」的，也就是好的創作了。在這裏，我們且不談那在文學上論爭已久的所謂形式決定內容或內容決定形式一類的麻煩問題，我們只想一想西洋哲人曾經說過的幾句話：</p>
<p>——無物在內，無物在外。</p>
<p>凡是內者，亦即是外。</p>
<p>“Nichts　ist　drinnen，nichts　ist　draussen，denn　was　innen，das　ist　aussen”</p>
<p>這幾句話，充分說明了藝術創作達到「均衡」時的一種混然一體的情態，有志文藝寫作的朋友是不妨加以三思的。</p>

<h3 id="c174">老太爺的悲劇〔小說〕（下） <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 田禽</p>
<p>過了沒有好一會兒的工夫，四代把父親告訴他所有買的東西都買了回來。總共還沒有用去一半的錢。賸下的一堆銅板，嘩拉一聲倒在坑上，老太爺，一聲不響放下了旱煙桿，拿起了酒壺，對着酒壺咀便喝起來了。接着就是一個一個的藍花荳，像打籃球投籃似的，一個一個的往咀裏投。然後，做出哥八哥八的音響。</p>
<p>四代蹲在地上大口大口的咬着燒餅捲果子。父子倆誰也不說什麼。個人都貪饞地享受着個人的一份兒。</p>
<p>最後還是四代崩出了一句話：「爹！今天咱們爺兒倆真像過年似的。…………」</p>
<p>他們一天的生活就這樣結束了。</p>
<p>內戰的結果，使農村破產，再加上連年的大災，越發使得這一老一小無法在本鄉本土生活下去了！</p>
<p>老太爺平生最恨人「跑海」，可是，當生活的鞭子抽打在自己的身上時，也不由得不走上自己所最痛恨的路了！</p>
<p>他們父子倆都是善良的農民，從來沒有離開過家門，除了趕集上廟外，甚至連本縣的縣城都沒有看見過。這樣一對不願出門的農民，現在也居然踏進了都市。并且澈底地改了行。</p>
<p>四代就憑着在鄉間學習的一點本領，居然也搭了班唱起戲來了。而且他們的生活真是改善了不少。</p>
<p>不看別的，單觀老太爺吧，穿的已經不是短打了，而是長衫，馬褂，吸的已不是旱煙桿，而是中等的洋煙捲。并且破例的續娶了一位長腳板的北京人做太太，雖說她已經四十出頭，長得也不漂亮，可是城裏人總是城裏人，大方，會說話，而且說的是滿口官話，總比故去的老伴高明多了。不過，老太爺總覺得她的腳板大，一旦回家，真怕鄉親們笑話，雖給他在城裏混了不少時候，但，對於娶老婆的標準，依然沒有改變，總認為小腳，白臉，黑頭髪，大眼。是最最標準的。</p>
<p>其實呢，老太爺也并不因為這老伴的腳大便討厭她。不然，為什麼接過來不久便懷起孕來呢！</p>
<p>四代現在雖然是班裏二流的武生，可是，每月的包銀并不少拿，三口之家除了開銷，那個月都有富裕。照說也該知足了。可是，四代到了城裏以後，越來眼界越寬，腦子也復雜了起來，沒有事兒的時候常好幻想，總以為一輩子靠這個行道，不是個辦法，雖說他能解決生活。但，究竟是個被人瞧不起的勾當。他時常在想，弄個官兒當當，金箍帽一戴够多麼神氣，有時一家子無聊時候，多少也吐露出他的一點志願，老太爺并不反對他的想法，在他，何嘗不願當個真牌子的老太爺呢，至於後娘，更沒有什麼話說，老太爺是一家之主，凡事他不反對，就必然走得通。</p>
<p>可是，老太爺雖不反對，但，對於眼前的生活多少也有點留戀。當官自然好，可是沒有門路，談何容易。</p>
<p>巷尾打着「招募新兵」的小白旗兒的丘八老爺到處都是。可是，總不能從當兵開頭兒啦，當兵就要打仗，而且是年年打仗，槍子是沒有眼睛的呀，時運不濟，一旦陣亡，官沒有當上，反而把命送掉，也是划不來的事，況且是自己打自己，有個什麼道理呀。</p>
<p>自然，四代也沒有這樣打算，說幹就幹馬上置二老的生活不顧，開腿就跑，當然不是那樣不通情達理的孩子，他不過是在想，同時也在設法找這樣的路子，在不妨碍全家的生活之下，他才敢去改行。</p>
<p>唱戲在當年雖是個低下的行道，可是，有些個達官貴人卻頗喜歡和這般人交往，特別是一般姨太太之流尤其喜歡唱戲的小白臉，這個道理殊令人不解。</p>
<p>四代唱了幾年戲，居然也認識了不少的這流人物，這對於他後來的發展有着莫大的關係。</p>
<p>老太爺真有個狠勁兒，不跑海便罷，一跑就是十幾年。雖然家鄉已經沒有他可留戀的東西了，然而他依然又回到了故土。其實，他連那間唯一的小破房早就賣掉了，回來連個住處都沒有，倒是為了什麼呢？</p>
<p>在老太爺的意思無非是為了誇耀鄉里，因為這次人家真當了老太爺了。說得好聽一點吧「水流千遭歸大海」也是人之常情。不管怎麼樣吧，老太爺衣錦還鄉是不折不扣的事實。</p>
<p>老太爺一下船，就轟動了全村，也難怪，鄉下人那見過這樣的場面，單說樟木箱子就是幾個，重顛顛的，其實，裏面也許是些破衣爛裳，可是，鄉下人見抬的人十分吃力，就肯定裏面是裝滿了袁世凱人頭的硬幣了。於是一傳十、十傳百地宣傳開去，說是老屋（　若亦）巴發財回家了。有些個人便七言八語的胡猜起來了！</p>
<p>爛眼邊兒對大嫂說：「哼，一定是當了紅鬍子了，要不介，憑他會發這樣大財。除了喝酒吹牛，他有什麼本事呀！」</p>
<p>二伏嬸子同意她這個說法：</p>
<p>「準是，你看，還搶了一個京油子來呢，要不是搶的，人家誰嫁給他這個窮小子！」</p>
<p>「對了，我猜這個女的一定是個寡婦，很有錢，就守着這個小兒子過日子，家裏沒有人手，老尾巴就乘火打劫的連人帶錢的搶來了。別處又不好躱，只好再回家，準是這末回事。」禿子的媳婦這樣搭訕着。不提防，禿子正從後面趕來，這些閒話灌了禿子個滿耳，他氣不打一處來，急跨一步，抓住了頭髪，踢了她幾腳。</p>
<p>「他媽的，就是你的閒話多，不怕惹禍，………」禿子嫂哭天抹淚的被勸架的人們給拉走了。自然，禿子也不好再追，這樣以來，閒話集團就這樣解散了。</p>
<p>老太爺呌人把行李送上岸，然後抱着他那個四五歲的二少爺，也下了船。老太爺的老伴緊跟着上了岸。</p>
<p>老太爺下了船，船家又問了一聲：</p>
<p>「你這老東西搬到那兒去？」</p>
<p>這句話倒難住了我們的老太爺，是呀？搬到那兒去呢？連個家都沒有，他漲紅了臉，尤其是老伴兩隻眼睛注視着他，他更感到難為情了。</p>
<p>人，畢竟是「福至心靈」的，他想了想，「搬到二大人家裏去吧。」</p>
<p>二大人是誰呢？當然船家不知道，住在那條街，那個巷子更無從知道，反正有老太爺頭前帶路，總不會走錯的。</p>
<p>行李搬到二老太爺家裏以後，總算安頓下來了。</p>
<p>二老太爺也有介紹的必要，二老太爺是老太爺的堂兄弟，他們本來是老早就分過家的了二老太爺相當有幾個錢，人口也不多，鄉下日子總可以說過得去的，所以對於老太爺這家不速之客的光臨，并不感覺興趣，雖然他是衣錦還鄉。加上二老太爺的太太，總脫不了鄉下人那個小氣勁兒，一進門又吃又喝地，簡直是八百廿個不高興。</p>
<p>老太爺第一天到家又大發了一次老太爺的脾氣，他剛一進街洽巧碰到賣燒餅果子的喜順，首先他發現老太爺。</p>
<p>「老尾巴叔！你好哇。…」</p>
<p>老太爺聽到有人喊他的小名，氣不打一處來，直着脖子，鼓着眼睛便開口大罵下來。</p>
<p>「小混蛋？太不知好歹了，我現在是老太爺了，你知不知道？隨便提我的小名，豈有此理，告訴你說，我…我…我在…江…西…的…時候…隨便那個師旅長都，…都要喊…我…一聲…老…太爺……」</p>
<p>他越罵越氣，越氣說話越不唎嗦，緊接着向喜順撲了去，打了他一記耳光，他身子一攫，籃子一歪，燒餅果子落個滿地，「哈、哈、哈………」</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人都笑了起來。自然還是有拉架的，喜順并不示弱，一邊檢着落了地燒餅果子，一邊還罵着：</p>
<p>「老虎尾巴！」這兒他索興都個「叔」字都免掉了。「喜順，算了吧。」一位背着糞筐子的老頭勸解着。把他拉到一邊後，轉過身來又向老太爺說：</p>
<p>「老……　，甘泉！看在我的面上，不要跟他鬧了，他年輕，犯不上。………」</p>
<p>「你聽聽，小兔崽子。他膽敢呌我的小名。……」</p>
<p>「你他媽一百個小兔崽子！自命他媽的老太爺，你是誰的老太爺呀？裝他媽蒜玩，他媽的你才穿了幾天有襠的褲子呀？還我賬，你記不記得你還賒過我三套燒餅果子呢。………」</p>
<p>他兩個人的咀誰也不讓誰，只因為中間有人勸拉，欲打不能！</p>
<p>結果，還是老太爺的老伴把他拉走了。</p>
<p>「快家去吧，跟他吵你不怕丟身份！」</p>
<p>老太爺聽到「身份」二字，覺得太太的見解是對的，於是回到了二老太爺的家裏。喜順呢，見他走了，自然也就沒有氣兒子，燒餅雖然打落了地，可是，究竟沒有什麼損失。除了沾了點兒土，反正照樣賣錢，再說又不是自己吃，管它呢。</p>
<p>「身份？。………」喜順聽到這兩個字，有點兒肉麻，撲嗤的笑了一聲，提着籃子走出了人羣。么喚了一聲。</p>
<p>「燒餅果子呀！」</p>
<p>二老爺二太太對這事似乎抱不干涉態度，老爺認為壽根發昌兩人都還不錯，雖然發昌更討人歡喜些，他卻并不定要阿冬嫁給發昌，太太呢，簡直沒工夫想到這種小事，她是樂天主義者，快活時，嘻嘻哈哈笑一通，躺到床鋪上抽幾筒大煙，適意地睡去了；不快活時向傭人丫頭，兜頭臭罵一陣，躺到床鋪上抽幾筒大煙，仍舊適意地睡去了。</p>
<p>然而，這於壽根的娘陳家嬸卻并非小事。我們得瞭解一個丈夫亡故只遺獨子的寡婦，經濟的拮据是當然事，同時想望抱孫的念頭在她心中佔着第一等位置。雖在鄉下，明媒正娶討一個媳婦，畢竟需要一筆可觀的花費，她明悬的雙眼早就往阿冬身上放下後半世的期望。然而，照目前這形勢發展下去，辛苦織就的好夢不將全盤打破了？</p>
<p>於是她盼望着河東媽媽的到來。</p>
<p>河東媽媽是出眾的媒婆，村中鎮上缺不來的人物。殷勤，會說，善於　笑，手腳勤快，雖然出身低微，卻能在各處大戶人家進出，博得上下一體的歡迎。她偶爾也　些禮物過來，如小鷄二只，鹹菜半　，回家時籃子照例比出門時更沉重些，夕陽塗紅她的容顏，一顆心分外地輕快。</p>
<p>這一天，河東媽媽到來，陳家嬸接待得分外認真，一連泡了三次茶，河東媽媽心裏奇怪，但也不願先問，就裝作若無其事地大談前天鎮上黃家的喜事：新娘娘俊俏是俊俏，只是臉上雀痣瘢多些；老爺太太常常鬧別扭，太太是要場面人，喜歡多賞幾個錢給底下人，老爺卻總要扣起一些，說用錢像削水片，能省幾個就省幾個，……一邊探索陳家嬸的面部表情，心裏納罕對方的好耐性，幸虧最後，陳家嬸畢竟畏葸地開言了。</p>
<p>「媽媽不瞞你說，我有椿心事，想拜托你。」</p>
<p>「你說來好了，我這老身子出得出一分力，那有不帮你忙的。」河東媽媽馬上迎合上去。</p>
<p>「也是婚嫁事體呵，我們壽根歲數也到把了。」</p>
<p>「是噢，好討媳婦了。幸虧壽根是老實人安安穩穩的，不然，這把年紀，早就癲狗般四處亂嗅亂鑽了。——你看中誰，我替你去說。」</p>
<p>「媽媽，你是明眼人，看得雪亮，也不用我說。」</p>
<p>「真的不曉得呵。」</p>
<p>「二老爺房裏的阿冬，還有誰？」</p>
<p>「噢——」媽媽終究忍不住，格格地笑出來了；「這……便當……你向二老爺太太說聲，不就成了」</p>
<p>「怎好自己去說啊，況且——」頓住了，隨着便一五一十將自己的難處訴說着，河東媽媽是絕頂的好人，當然滿口答應下來。</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人自然也各自走散了。可是，這樣一鬧鄉村裏可有了談話資料了。</p>
<p>農村的六月是鬱熱的，傍晚，一推飯碗，大家便沒事兒可幹了，三個人一羣，五個人一夥兒的坐在房上乘涼，打着赤背搖着芭蕉扇，談天說地。</p>
<p>老太爺第一天到家就鬧了這多笑話，當然乘涼的人談話的題目不約而同的便集中在這方面了。</p>
<p>恰好這天是十五，明月當空，萬里無雲，越發顯得月姊的皎潔，簡直像白天差不多。</p>
<p>老太爺的一家子和二老太爺的一家子，也都上了房乘涼了，另外還有幾個穿門的人，他們都想從老太爺身上得到更多的新消息。</p>
<p>老太爺拿着兩張像是給大家看，一張是全家福，前面坐的是老太爺夫婦，傍邊站着京油子生的小兒子，後面站着一對青年夫婦，男的是全付武裝，女的着長旗袍，剪髪，懷裏還抱着一個不會走的小男娃，這對青年夫婦就是四代家倆口子，不會走的小男娃就是老太爺的小孫子，這是地地道道的三世同堂，另一張，乃是四袋單人的全付武裝像，戴的是金邊帽，挎的是東洋刀，看來倒真像個軍人的樣子，他現在已經是個小隊長了。至於階級最高也不過是個上尉。然而農民出身的老太爺，有了這樣一個好兒子，一個做了官的兒子，便以為了不起了。</p>
<p>老太爺滿臉帶着囂張，把像片傳給眾人看。</p>
<p>「××！咱們四…四代…可真…有出息，現在升了隊長了。…我們在…江西…的時候，家裏還有…勤務兵…伺候着。…他一張口就得…叫…叫我…我老太爺，兄弟，我現在是大…大大人了，你…你就是…二…二大人…」</p>
<p>別人只哼着哈着聽他一個人吹。二大人對於他的話并不感覺興趣，他多少也有點兒看得出，於是他又轉向幾個穿門的人吹起來了。</p>
<p>「四代這孩子是有…有人緣兒，他們…師長最…喜歡…他所以把他認為干兒子…你們想，師長的干兒子要…升起來還不快嗎？俗話說得好，朝裏有人好做官，將來當個團旅長還不容易嗎？等…等咱們四代當了…旅長…先把咱們村裏的菩薩廟修修，…這…這…這是咱們村裏的風水。…你們說是吧？」</p>
<p>「是！」穿門的人們都迎合着老太爺答應了個「是」字。</p>
<p>「你們看，我也當官了。」老太爺的小兒子戴着他哥哥的金邊帽，手舞足蹈的向大家吼着。這都是老太爺夫婦教的，本來大熱的天小孩子不願意戴那個呢軍帽，可是為了宣傳四代是真當了軍官，硬逼着孩子戴起來，向村人們顯示。</p>
<p>「好孩子，戴起來，爸爸明天給你買糖吃。……」老太爺私下裏跟兒子講了，才這樣幹的。所以他小兒子隨便在什麼地方玩，都戴着那頂金邊帽。</p>
<p>「別蹦裏，跳塌子你二叔的房子！這孩子！」小兒子正在替父行道的時候，京油子擺出母親的威風，鄭重其事的教訓着小兒子。</p>
<p>「你真是狗長觕角多管閒事。孩子……高興玩玩有你的…什麼…。跳…跳塌了房子；咱們蓋新的…有…有的是不。」</p>
<p>老太爺向老伴顯了顯威風。還好，老伴沒有還理，這場小風波就這樣過去了，可是，因此，空氣卻沉默了一個不斷的時間。</p>
<p>穿門的人們拖着疲憊的身軀都回家就寢去了。</p>
<p>「你們再涼快會兒吧，大哥，我們要去睡了，明天還有事。……」二老太爺夫婦算是客氣了這麼幾句話吧，不等老太爺有什麼回答就登上梯子，下房去了。</p>
<p>老太爺家三口坐着覺得已經沒有了吹的對向，也覺得十分無趣，接着也就下房去睡了。</p>
<p>老太爺回家沒有半月，全村對他都有了惡感，也難怪，他整天吃了酒就亂罵人，逢人就擺老太爺的架子。鄉下人可就有這麼點兒怪脾氣，你有錢有勢是你的，反不上拍你那份馬屁。</p>
<p>三年後的六月間，四代雖然又經過了幾次內戰，但，旅長仍然沒升上，依然是個隊長，而且在大戰中還受了一次傷，幸虧沒有喪命。</p>
<p>中午，街上是靜靜的，太陽像毒火似的燃燒着大地，人們都躱在旁裏避暑，野狗伸出長舌，哈哈的在喘氣。有幾個小孩子一絲不掛的在晒燙了石階上靠着，看樣子他們是剛從河裏洗過澡回來，週身還流着沒有干的水，意思要在石階上烤干了。</p>
<p>這個村落週團都是水，所以住在這兒的七八歲的小孩子們都會游水，否則大人們是不放心的</p>
<p>忽然從村邊上傳來一陣哭聲，是那樣悽慘，聽哭的聲音并不像是當地人的音調，那是一個女人的哭聲，少頃，隱約的還聽到一個男子的喔喔的哭聲。孩子們用小手遮住了耳朵。</p>
<p>「聽！」比較大的一個說聲「聽」字，別的孩子們也都靜靜地豎起耳朵來了。　　「我猜一定是老尾巴那個小兒子淹死了！」小跑不了這樣說着。</p>
<p>「對了，他還沒學會洗澡呢，就往深處浮（讀父），那還有個不淹死的呀！」　　「大人們都說正上午河裏有鬼，他一定是呌鬼拉了說了。」</p>
<p>「那我們以後正上午的時候也不要洗去了。……」</p>
<p>孩子們推測的果然不錯，死的真是老太爺的小兒子。光着屁骨的小死尸橫陳在河邊的樹蔭下，京油子撲在尸首身上哭得死去活來，老太爺的眼淚也直流，自然旁边少不了看熱鬧，也少不了勸解的。</p>
<p>緊接着就是各家的母親在太陽底下奔跑着喊着他們兒子的小名，因為村裏傳說着淹死了孩子，半天沒有看到自己的兒子，她們都沉不住氣了。</p>
<p>小孩子們都圍攏着死尸看熱鬧，喊呌的聲音有時聽的清楚，有時也聽不清楚，甚至有的孩子聽到母親在呌也置之不理。等到母親來在跟前一把抓住，不由分說又打又罵。</p>
<p>「小王八蛋肏的，喊了你半天你都不答應，你聾了，你啞了。………」緊着在身上就是拍拍幾巴掌，孩子哇的聲哭了。</p>
<p>「快滾回去，敢再上午頭上給我出來洗澡。………」</p>
<p>老太爺大　哭了半天也沒把兒子哭轉來，託人買了個木匣子埋了。</p>
<p>夫婦倆好幾天的工夫眼都發直，發紅，幾天都沒有吃飯，可是老太爺卻沒有斷過酒。而且比平常更喝多了。</p>
<p>小兒子死了以後，好多天沒有接到大兒子的信，心裏着實不放心，偏偏又趕上江西方面又起了內戰，萬一有個三長兩短，老太爺的生活馬上就發生了問題。他倒掛了頭時時在沉思着。京油子也陷入極端痛苦之中。</p>
<p>福無雙至，禍不單行。兒子來信說，小孫子因為出天花也夭折了。這次作戰雖沒有掛彩，可是，這個仗且有個打頭兒呢，一時半時是不會完的。</p>
<p>最後還勸了老子幾句，說他在家鄉處處要待人和氣，我這個官兒并算不了什麼，千萬不要一張口咱們是官，甚至欺負同鄉，這些事千萬幹不得的！</p>
<p>老太爺呌人家替他念過信以後，滿肚子不高興，信裏不但沒有寄錢來，而且帶來了壞消息，末了，還教訓老子一頓，越想越氣，索興就跳着腳來破口大罵。「小王八蛋，做了官，連老子都教訓起來了，明天我非…給…我們…親…！親…親家×師長寫封信不可……叫他…好好地…管教管教……他。…」</p>
<p>他一半生氣，一半也是向那個替他讀信的人賣弄一下他的背景。</p>
<p>跟師長是親家，那還了得。</p>
<p>轉過年來，老太爺的運氣更糟了！大兒子陣亡以後撫恤金迄未領到，守寡的兒婦也不知去向。</p>
<p>手裏的一點積蓄早就花光了。帶回家的幾個樟木箱子，本來一到家的那年無條件的送給了二老太爺一隻，如今他也不承認了。硬呌人家付他五塊錢，說是他并沒有送給他。好在二老太爺有的是錢，送給你五塊，也沒有多大關係，反正箱子是人家的了。</p>
<p>可是，為了箱子問題，二老太爺逼着他搬了家，他在河南邊借了人家一間小破房裏住去了。現在只賸下了兩個孤老，當然他不敢反抗了。</p>
<p>不過，他搬出去以後，不斷的放空氣，說什麼當年老輩分家不清，我們得重分分，萬一二老太爺不肯的話，我就叫我們親家×師長…寫…寫封信…給…縣長</p>
<p>話是這樣說，可是他始終也沒再敢惹人家。東西賣光以後，他雖然是將近花甲之年的人了，仍不得不幹起舊行道了—種田，打魚。這呌做那裏丟了那裏找，幹什麼的總歸要幹什麼。</p>
<p>京油子呢，每天挨着門流着眼淚去乞討，生活雖然這樣苦，他們依然一天天一年年的挨下去</p>
<p>小破房裏雖說四壁皆空，可是那兩張像片仍然貼在墻上。金邊門邊掛在迎門口，下邊還有一張一家之主的皂君像。</p>
<p>掙扎，掙扎，畢竟是年歲大了，身體支不住了。</p>
<p>終於在他六十二歲的那年，害了一場大病把命送掉了。他在臨嚥氣的時候，躺在門板上還叫著×師長，×親家。……</p>
<p>京油子住在停尸床邊，老淚都哭不出來了。……</p>
<p>卅五，六，九。于重慶。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>這麼嚴寒的氣候，小紅還只穿着一件破舊的薄棉襖，下面穿一條布單褲。天不亮就得爬起來出去買菜，然後燒早飯。可憐小紅每次清晨從外面回來的時候，頭髪眉毛上的霜，都結成了冰！但是不能說一聲冷，否則霉闆娘便會罵她是裝腔作勢，說：「如今晚，不過是娶小紅來當童養媳，可并不是娶小紅來當少奶奶的！所以少不得就要做做活兒，廖家的糧食不能呌白吃！」其實，老闆娘的原意是要不化錢雇一個無期限的長工罷了。小紅自然不敢還抗，她聽見自己的媽常講過：作媳婦的總免不了受委屈。作小媳婦的，（即「童養媳」的俗稱）。就更要受折磨了。況且她的裁縫爹曾經告訴她，廖棟不是老闆娘親生兒子，所以連廖棟都不在她的心上，何況廖棟的童養媳？明白這些，小紅只有忍！她想着忍到了廖棟長大成人的一天，她也就可以出頭了。她也像廖棟自己一樣，熱切盼他快快長大。她把全部希望，寄托在廖棟的身上！她含辛茹苦地操作，而她所受的待遇卻慘得很！她把三餐飯燒好了，伺候老闆娘他們吃罷以後，她就只有拿鹽水泡飯充饑。老闆娘永遠沒有想到應當留一些殘餘的剩菜賞給她。在這滴水成冰的天氣，老闆娘命令她一盆盆地洗衣服，但不準她用熱水，因為太費柴。小紅一邊洗着，盆裏的水一邊結了冰；這情形老闆娘不曾看見，更不曾體念到；在冰裹面洗衣服的人，他的手會凍成什麼樣子？就這樣，好容易洗完了衣服，老闆娘還呌她給廖老闆，和自己的兒子廖棟；以及自己；做鞋，襪；小紅的指頭常常在針底下流着鮮紅的血，一針針，宛如扎進她的心裏！可小紅都咬着牙承受了，她絕不人前人後「哼」一聲兒。除非到了晚上，她躺到床上休息的時候，薄被禦不了寒，她的四肢成夜只有蜷着，不能伸直，全身沒有一點溫氣。於是她想着：這時如果在自己的家裏，媽任怎樣窮，也會烘幾根柴使他取煖。而在這裏，她不可能走近那老闆娘身邊的火盆一步兒，因此，她哭了，她悄悄抱怨爹媽不該把自己送到這裏來！在家裏凍死餓死，她情願！卻不甘心在這裏，無盡止地受着磨難。就是凍餓而死，爹媽都不會知道的！舉目無親，名分上雖然有個未婚的丈夫，直到現在，還不曾和他交過一語。她灰心，她悲哀！她覺得這日子就像一個盼不到天亮的黑夜，直到她抽噎着矇朧地入了夢，她才算真正地得到了憇息。</p>
<p>廖老闆覺得小紅越發比過門之前第一次看見她時瘦　了，而且目睹她一天到晚忙個不休，心裏非常不安，於是有一次便向老闆娘說：</p>
<p>「小紅身體不好，別呌她做的事太多了，這樣下去會累壞孩子的！天又冷，怪可憐的。」</p>
<p>可是老闆娘卻大不以為然。說：</p>
<p>「當初娶她的時候，原是要她來帮？帮我的忙，這也是你同意了的。怎麼？難道現在還要我去扶侍她不成？」</p>
<p>老闆娘的口氣有些惱！心裏想：「連前房兒子的童養媳都是袒護的。」因此，更是對小紅起了反感。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Three Prominent Points in Ceasefire Order: Chairman Urgently Hopes for Comprehensive Discussion; Zhou Enlai Visits Marshall for Lengthy Talk Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall and his staff, with superhuman energy, working tirelessly day and night, have drafted a new permanent ceasefire proposal. It is also heard that the informal three-person military council began its meeting at Special Envoy Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road on the afternoon of the 17th. If the talks result in a convergence of opinions between the two sides, a formal meeting may be announced in a timely manner. Ceasefire talks are rapidly progressing towards the door of peace amidst urgent and complex matters. The three days of the 18th, 19th, and 20th will be a crucial juncture for determining the fate of China and the fate of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Today, there are only five days remaining until the ceasefire deadline. While the people of the country have varying opinions regarding the future development of the overall situation, with some being pessimistic and others optimistic, behind-the-scenes news suggests that the major issues currently awaiting resolution are not as complex and mysterious as rumored. It is heard that Chinese Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai had a lengthy talk with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours on the morning of the 17th, during which they discussed issues related to the ceasefire in Northeast China (including the areas where the Communist army is stationed in the Northeast, local government, and traffic management) and the proportion of military reorganization in the Northeast. The detailed content has not been released.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Chairman Chiang, at the Central Memorial Week meeting, analyzed the current domestic political situation, stating that the government has consistently adopted a political solution to the Communist Party issue, but the Communist Party has been constantly delaying and undermining national peace and unity. The Chairman concluded by saying: "The ceasefire deadline in the Northeast is only four or five days away. I sincerely hope that concrete measures can be negotiated during this period so that the three prominent points in the ceasefire order can be fully resolved."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] The key to the success or failure of peace negotiations seems to hinge on whether an agreement can be reached on how to determine the arbitration authority of General Marshall and the U.S. representatives of the Executive Headquarters and Executive Groups. The government has clearly stated that it will adhere to the original proposal for arbitration. Government representative General Xu Yongchang submitted a formal memorandum regarding the issue of arbitration authority to the Communist Party delegation yesterday. The Communist Party has not yet responded to this memorandum but will insist on the principle of consensus among all parties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] According to Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, the principles and methods for restoring transportation have been largely determined and will be announced to the public in three days. It is heard that a concrete agreement is expected to be reached before the 20th. Colonel Hill plans to visit Zhou Enlai again tonight to make a decisive discussion on the restoration of transportation. Regarding the issues of dismantling fortifications, participating in management, and road protection police, the opinions of both sides are largely converging.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The railway bureaus in North China are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the transportation restoration negotiations. The Ministry of Communications has sent telegrams to the engineering personnel of the Pinghan, Longhai, and Jiaoji Railway Bureaus, urging them to actively prepare. As soon as a negotiation agreement is reached, they will be dispatched to various regions to actively work. Wu Shi'en, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway, and the Director of the Zhangming Section Engineering Office of the Pinghan Railway are both in Nanjing, awaiting the final news.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to an announcement made here today, Central Navy warships, acting on the orders of the Northeast Security Headquarters, have occupied the Changshan Islands at the mouth of the Bohai Bay. The only sea route between the Communist army in Shandong and the Northeast has been cut off by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 17th] From late night on the 16th to 7:00 a.m. on the 17th, gunshots were heard sporadically and frequently in the city. Dangerous elements lurking in the city had several clashes with the defending troops and military police.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Communist army in Jiaodong, Jimo area outside Qingdao, within 34 hours after the ceasefire order took effect, gathered tens of thousands of troops and launched a full-scale attack on the garrison troops in Jiaoxian, Jimo, Chengyang, and Lancun areas. Within a few days, the aforementioned strongholds were successively captured by them. This kind of attack and seizure of territory by the Communist army, destructive behavior, caused innocent civilians to be brutally killed. The defending garrison troops, due to exhaustion of ammunition and food, perished together with the cities, and the number is countless. The details of the battle are as follows: (1) The Communist army in Lancun and Jiaoxian launched simultaneous attacks at 9:00 p.m. on the 8th. Their main force was Wu Kehua's unit. In addition, there were about 20,000 troops from Hao Pengju's unit, equipped with flat trajectory guns, small cannons, light and heavy machine guns, etc. Among them, the shooters were all Japanese. By 3:00 p.m. on the 9th, our defending troops ran out of ammunition and food. At the same time, about a thousand plainclothes armed Communists infiltrated the city and ambushed us, forming an internal and external attack. Our troops could not defend and broke through from the Lancun defense area. The casualties on both sides were very heavy. (2) The Communist army's Shandong Liberation Army's 4th Brigade, New 8th Regiment, New 9th Regiment, and Coastal Defense Militia Regiment, and the Nanhai District Independent Regiment besieged Jimo City. After eight days and nights of fierce fighting, the defending troops fought bravely, but due to excessive casualties, exhaustion of food, and no reinforcements, they broke through the south gate at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th and are now transferred to the Dazhou Village area. (3) More than 3,000 Communist troops launched a siege on Chengyang in several routes and were captured at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th. Our defending troops are continuing to resist in the Wangjiazhuang and Nuguo areas.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 16th] (1) On the night of the 14th, 13,000 Communist troops launched fierce attacks in four routes towards Shao'erzhuang, Xinglongzhuang, Dajiao, Qihe, Sangzidian, Licheng and other places outside Jinan. Our troops on all routes responded calmly and gave them head-on blows. Both sides are still in a stalemate in the same location. (2) The Communist army attacking Dangjiazhuang in Yancheng launched fierce and powerful attacks on us several times last night and this morning, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. The enemy suffered many casualties and has retreated to its original position. (3) The bandits attacking Gaojiao have now completely turned to Jimo, Chengyang, Liuting, Xiazhuang, Huangbu and other places nearby, and their momentum is quite rampant. They are using Japanese as light and heavy weapons shooters, using fierce artillery fire to bombard our city and positions. The Xiguan of Jimo has been broken through by the Communist army and street fighting is underway. The battles in various places are extremely fierce. (4) The Communist army attacking Dawenkou has slightly reduced its offensive after being fiercely attacked by us for several days. Both sides are in a stalemate in the original positions. (5) Yidu is actively building fortifications on both sides of the Mi River and prohibits pedestrians in order to block all ferries across the Mi River. (6) Since the 10th, the Communist army has arrested our military, government, party, group, and religious personnel in Zhangdian. Most of them were killed. Soldiers who were captured were tied with iron wires and brutally beaten. It was extremely cruel. This afternoon, the Communist army again detained thousands of people in the direction of Yancheng, intending to launch a major attack on us.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] The defending troops who lost various places in Shandong Province in the past week have now arrived in the suburbs of Jinan. A part of the defending troops in Dezhou arrived near the Ji River. Commander Wang Jixiang's whereabouts are unknown. Commissioner Liu Shoucen is reportedly still in Dezhou, living with the task group. Zhangdian Commander Liu Zongyan was captured in Zhangqiu while leading his troops to break through. Commissioner Wang Chunyuan has safely arrived in Jinan. Zhoucun Commander Wang Yantian led the remnants of his troops to Jinan. Tai'an defending troops Commander Ning Chunlin and County Magistrate Liu Zhence also led their troops to the southwest suburbs of Jinan. Party groups from all walks of life here have been going to the suburbs to offer condolences for several days.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] The Communist army besieging Wenxi concentrated artillery fire on the morning of the 15th and destroyed the southern city wall of Wenxi.

<h3 id="e8">Brude Flies to Changchun Today; Preparing to Start Mediation Work in the Northeast; Zheng Jiemin Says Agreement Lies in Implementation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Brude did not leave on the 17th and has been rescheduled to fly to Changchun on the 18th. An official in charge said to reporters that Brude's main mission to Changchun is still to complete the preparatory work for the Changchun Executive Subdivision, waiting to begin work immediately after the establishment of a comprehensive ceasefire plan in the Northeast. Currently, between now and the 22nd, the Executive Department can implement mediation based on the tripartite agreement of March 23rd, but because the period is too short, personnel cannot be deployed in time, and there is not much need in this short period. Therefore, the start of the Northeast Executive Subdivision's work still depends on the establishment of a peace charter. After Government Committee Member Zheng Jiemin of the Executive Department returned to Beiping last night, he went to the office today. Due to busy affairs, more than ten reporters from Beiping City who visited in the morning and afternoon were not received. He only told reporters in the afternoon that the signing of the new agreement is still based on the old agreement and requires efforts to implement it. Today is the tenth day of the ceasefire. In the Executive Department of the peace command, the heat is stifling. Both the government and the Communist Party are increasingly cautious in releasing news. Reporters are running into obstacles everywhere, complaining bitterly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The Military Mediation Department has decided to send four more task groups to the Northeast to conduct mediation work.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Zheng Dongguo Tells Reporters: No Serious Conflicts in the Northeast <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo met with foreign reporters at his residence on the morning of the 17th. Zheng said: "In recent days, except for occasional attacks by a few Communist troops on the National Army's defense areas, there have been no serious military conflicts. The main force of the Communist army is currently concentrated in the Tonghua and Dunhua areas. The National Army is abiding by orders and remaining stationary. The Communist army is mobilizing frequently and often attacks our small strongholds with large forces. The purpose of the fifteen-day ceasefire is to resolve issues such as military reorganization and restoration of transportation. However, ten days have passed since the ceasefire, and these issues have not been resolved due to the Communist Party's delay." During the meeting, French reporter Rouel expressed his view that this ceasefire period provided the Communist army with an opportunity to reorganize. After the Battle of Siping Street, the main force of the Communist army was defeated, and the situation was quite critical.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] About 500 Communist troops arrived near Taipingchuan, 20 kilometers east of Meihe, and Xinhebao today. They also destroyed two bridges near Hainan Sili Zi Shuangmiao. The Communist army in Huinan is active near Kaoxiaotun.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Pauley Inspects Fushun Mine; Preliminary Report on Investigation Completed; The Amount of Materials Taken Away by the Soviet Union is Astonishing <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] American Reparations Commissioner Pauley and his team, accompanied by Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, Special Commissioner Sun Yueqi, and Economic Affairs Committee Member Cheng Zongyang, departed from the Fushun Coal Mine by car at 8:30 a.m. on the 17th. They first went to the power plant for inspection. The scale of the factory is huge and the equipment is perfect. It is not only the first in China, but also rare in the Far East. The new power generators have all been transported away, and the old ones cannot be used. They then went to inspect the oil plant, the Xilutianku (coal mine), the liquefaction plant, and the light metal king factory. Among the factories, the power plant, the liquefaction plant, and the oil plant suffered the most losses and were the most severely damaged. The new machines were transported away, and the old ones were destroyed. A small part of the three factories have resumed work, but it is not easy to resume all work. The light metal factory suffered less damage, but there are no raw materials, and it has not yet resumed work. The entire inspection was completed at 12:00 noon. At 1:00 p.m., they boarded the car and left Fushun for Liaoyang, Anshan, and other places for inspection.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 16th] According to a preliminary report submitted by members of the American Reparations Team to Reparations Commissioner Pauley yesterday, the amount of materials taken away from the Northeast by the Soviet occupation forces in the two months from September to November last year is almost unbelievable. The figures in the preliminary report of the Reparations Team are based on materials provided by officials of the Chinese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Japanese factory personnel, and personal investigations. According to Pauley, this survey shows that most of the materials were moved out between mid-September and November last year. However, what is hard to believe is that Soviet officials could transport such a large amount of materials in such a short period of time. According to the preliminary report, the equipment removed from the industry in the Shenyang area seems to be more than in other areas of the Northeast, because Shenyang is the most important city in the Northeast and a transportation hub. Pauley and most of his team members will go to Tokyo this week to meet with General MacArthur. However, the twelve team members led by engineer expert Hotard will remain in the Northeast for a month and meet with Pauley again after returning to Washington. A part of the team will go to Taiwan for inspection on Tuesday of this week, and after Pauley arrives there, they will accompany him to Paris.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 17th] The investigation team led by American Reparations Commissioner Pauley reported to Pauley today that it has investigated 75 to 80 percent of the industry in the Northeast, but the extent of the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast and its impact on the Northeast's economy cannot be determined until the investigation is completed in one to three weeks. According to the survey results of one week, the demolition of the important factories of various industries and the important machines of various factories is tantamount to a fatal blow to the economy of the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Pei Zuoyi Discusses Current Financial Issues in Tianjin <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] Pei Zuoyi, President of the Central Bank, went to Tianjin from Beiping on the 16th and will stay in Tianjin for four days before going to the Northeast depending on the situation. Li Junyao, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, and Wang Wenwei, Special Commissioner of the Northeast Region, who went to Tianjin with Pei, have left Tianjin for Shenyang today. It is reported that Pei's main mission in Tianjin is to inspect the current financial situation in Tianjin in order to prepare for improving the financial institutions in North China. Therefore, detailed investigations are being conducted in both Beiping and Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th] After arriving in Tianjin, the President of the Central Bank discussed several current financial issues: (1) The rumor that we have raised the exchange rate of the US dollar is not true and will not change recently. (2) Although the official opening date of the foreign exchange market in Tianjin has not been announced, in fact, banks such as the Bank of China have already opened, but settlement is only made in Shanghai. (3) The exchange rate is the standard of a country's foreign trade value and cannot be divided into two exchange rates for import and export trade. Regarding encouraging exports, the government is trying to find ways, but there are too many difficulties in export trade, including (A) market interest rates are too high, (B) transportation is difficult, increasing export costs, and (C) domestic prices are high and wages are high. However, in terms of finance, the Central Bank has promised to find ways to provide exporters with low-interest funds and facilitate the turnover of funds from the interior to the port and sea port. (4) The so-called inflation at present is actually a psychological effect. If development and construction can be carried out, the currency may still feel insufficient. This requires everyone's efforts. (5) The government should support commercial banks so that they can gain a foothold. The Central Bank's financial inspection work is to implement government orders.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Economic Planning Committee Meeting Scheduled to Open on July 1st; Session to Last Six Days with a Total of Fifty Committee Members <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Economic Planning Committee Meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs is scheduled to open on July 1st, with a planned session of six days. A total of forty committee members have been hired, along with ten committee members from the Ministry, for a total of fifty committee members.

Minister Wang returned to Nanjing this morning. It is heard that Wang listened to a report on some state-owned industries in Shanghai, but the various issues of the Zhonglian Company will be thoroughly assessed and studied during his next trip to Shanghai. The offices of the special commissioners of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in various places were originally scheduled to close at the end of June, but because the various processing tasks have not been completed, it has now been decided to extend the deadline by three months before closing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] It is learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken over a total of twelve factories in the Nanjing area, nine of which have property rights issues.

<p>(5) Damage to Transportation: Since the issuance of the order to cease conflict and restore transportation, the following transportation lines have been successively attacked and damaged by the Communist army: On the Longhai Railway line, the Taimiao, Baitabu, Bayiji, Xin'an, Ahu, Yunhe, and Daxujia stations, as well as the railway from Shangqiu to Minquan; on the Jinpu Railway, the Yanzhou, Dawenkou, Fengjiakou, Tangguantun, Hangu, Tangshan, and Machang stations, as well as the Linzi branch line and stations nearby; on the Jiaoji Railway, the Yidu, Gaomi Tabao, and Zhangling stations, as well as the Xin'an, Zhoucun, Mingshui, and Longshan lines; on the Pinghan Railway, the lines in Beiping, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, and between Anyang, Tangyin, Guangshui, and Wushengguan; on the Daoqing Railway, the Jixian station; on the Tongpu Railway, between Taigu and Xuqing, between Houma and Wenxi, and between Jiexiu and Pingyao; on the Zhengtai Railway, the Yangquan station and between Pingding and Niangziguan; on the Baijin Railway, the railway near Qin County and the Zihong River railway bridge; on the Pingsui Railway, near the Guisui station and between Jining and Zhuozishan; on the Yeba-Chifeng Railway, the Tianyi station; on the Jincheng Railway, the Pingquan and Lingyuan stations and between Beizhen and Taipingfang; and on the Beining Railway, the Wanjiatun station and the entire western section of the Beining Railway line. All these were destroyed by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Obstruction of Transportation Restoration: Initially, during negotiations at the Beiping Executive Headquarters, the Communist Party used the pretext of strenuously vying for railway rights and management to delay the restoration of transportation. Subsequently, a plan was drafted by the American side and approved by the Military Tripartite Group, ordering both sides to assist in the restoration. However, the Communist army again used the pretext that the bunkers and city defense works protecting transportation must be completely removed to obstruct it. The following are examples of their obstruction: The Longhai Railway east of Xuzhou has been repaired, but the Communist army does not allow traffic. It was decided to first repair the Yuanshi to Gaoyi section within the Communist-occupied area of the Pinghan Railway, and track laying began on March 27th. However, on March 31st, the Communist army destroyed the repaired track again and transported the sleepers away. The section of the Jiaoji Railway west of Zhangdian has been obstructed and halted by the Communist army. The Tai'an to Liguo Station section and the Botou to Yancheng section of the Jinpu Railway have also been obstructed and halted by the Communist army. In addition, the Communist army has obstructed the Nankou section of the Pingsui Railway and the Gaomi section of the Jiaoji Railway, which have not yet started construction. Furthermore, the Communist army has detained and attacked government and American representatives of the mediation executive groups. The personnel of the executive groups in various places, who were originally representatives of all parties executing the order to cease conflict, had a significant mission. They had been agreed upon by the Communist side to have full freedom to inspect and act in any area or any conflict location. However, the Communist army deceived or deliberately made things difficult in many ways, making it impossible for the group personnel to perform their duties, or used the pretext of protection to prohibit independent action. Recently, government and American representatives have been detained and injured by the Communist army. For example, a group of seven government and American representatives of the Botou group were lured to Nanpi under the guise of consultation and detained by the Communist army on May 5th. At the same time, the Communist army launched an offensive in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The group representatives were not released until the 12th. The Communist army representatives of the Chengde group repeatedly obstructed government and American representatives from going to various places for investigation. The American and government representatives were monitored and unable to work. The government and American representatives of the Chifeng group have been imprisoned in the guest house by the Communist army since May 5th and have not yet been freed. Although the tripartite committee in Beiping ordered them to go to various conflict areas for investigation, the Communist group members refused to accompany them. The American representative then requested to leave the city alone for investigation but was also rejected. The Communist Party representatives of the Chaoyang group consistently refused to participate for various reasons and, under the pretext of protection, prohibited free movement for the government and the other party representatives. Furthermore, on February 26th, the Communist army attacked the National Army in the Guozhangzi area, 80 li southeast of Pingquan. On March 1st, a group of several people including Colonel Routh, the American representative of the Chengde group, traveled from Pingquan to mediate. Unexpectedly, the car carrying the group personnel was machine-gunned by the Communist army for half an hour after entering the Communist defense zone through Xiaosigou, and the car was hit in many places. Lieutenant Colonel Hanriff, the American representative of the 26th group, was sniped at by the Communist army in Beipiao, suffering a back injury, and the interpreter was killed.

<h3 id="e16">"Third Party" Luo Longji: Glass Pants, Crooked Neck <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] People in Nanjing have gradually become acquainted with the "third parties" mentioned in the newspapers. Regarding Mr. Luo Longji, the "tail-end doctor" among the "third parties," some jokingly call him "glass pants" because everything inside is completely exposed, leaving no room to hide. Others call him "crooked neck," implying that the public is increasingly disappointed in gentlemen who are not upright and whose heads are biased. Because the current situation requires impartial figures like Zhang Junmai, who possess political morality and do not engage in opportunistic behavior, to enhance the voice of genuine third parties in order to shoulder the great responsibility of resolving difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Commemoration of the Premier's Ordeal in Guangzhou Held Jointly with Memorial Week; Chairman Chiang Encourages Promoting Revolutionary Spirit <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The commemoration of the Premier's ordeal in Guangzhou was held jointly with the Central Memorial Week at the National Government this morning, the 17th. After Chairman Chiang presided over the ceremony, he delivered a speech, encouraging all comrades to promote the revolutionary spirit, stating briefly: Today, we hold the 24th anniversary of the Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou. All comrades are well aware of the Father of the Nation's ordeal that year, so I need not elaborate. However, one point must be emphasized: the rapid development and great success of the National Revolution Movement in the 24 years from 1922 to the present are all due to the great inspiration of the Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou. The Father of the Nation's ordeal in Guangzhou was the most violent attack on the National Revolution Movement by the reactionaries. If Chen Jiongming's conspiracy had succeeded at that time, the future of the revolution would have been unimaginable. However, the Father of the Nation, based on the revolutionary spirit and his responsibility to the nation and the people, resolutely regarded himself as Wen Tianxiang, disregarding life and death, and led a small number of comrades in a fierce battle against the reactionaries, with nine deaths and one life. This spirit of fearlessness was the greatest reason for the rapid development of the National Revolution Movement later. As we recall the serious difficulties the Father of the Nation encountered that year, he was able to overcome the dangers and make the revolution grow stronger with each setback. Given the solid foundation and favorable environment of today's revolution, as long as we adhere to the Father of the Nation's Three Principles of the People and our responsibility to the nation and the people, without fearing difficulties and striving diligently, any difficulty can be overcome, and we hold unlimited optimism for the future of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After today's Memorial Week, President Chiang summoned Wang Bao’an, the newly appointed chairman of the Jiangsu Party Headquarters, and gave detailed instructions on promoting compulsory work in Jiangsu Province in the future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] The Guangzhou community held a general assembly to commemorate the Premier's ordeal at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on the 17th.

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Today is the memorial day for revolutionary martyrs in Taiwan.

<p>[Our Beiping, 17th Dispatch] The restoration of Mongolian banners in Suiyuan Province is gradually progressing. (1) The troops from Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces stationed in the Ikh Juu League to assist the Mongolian banners in the War of Resistance have withdrawn as their mission has been completed. The security of the Ikh Juu League is now entirely maintained by the Mongolian banner security teams. Recently, the security teams of various banners have been reorganized, with each banner's security team stipulated to have 300 members. (2) The Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, which was established in the Jassak Banner of the Ikh Juu League during the War of Resistance, has seen its key members abandon Suiyuan for Baotou. Therefore, there is a proposal to relocate the Jassak Banner Mongolian Political Council to Baotou to conduct business. However, as the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee had a motion to restore the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, if that motion is implemented, the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council can be abolished. Therefore, the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council remains in a wait-and-see state. (3) Prince A of the Fuxing Banner, who was captured by the enemy, and Prince Kang of the Darat Banner, who remained in the rear during the War of Resistance, have both returned to their banners and resumed their duties. Queen Qi Junfeng (Queen of the West Gong Banner), Ba Yunying (Queen of the East Gong Banner), and Erenhang Dalai Maoming (Queen of the An Banner), who were exiled to Shanba during the War of Resistance, have all returned to their banners victoriously and resumed their duties after the enemy surrendered. (4) After the dictator of the Jungar Banner in the Ikh Juu League, Qi Wenying, was assassinated on his way to Jassak on March 17th of the lunar calendar, the Jungar Banner was leaderless. Chief Fu ordered Mongolian and Han Chinese people in the banner to organize an autonomous committee to govern the banner affairs. Regarding the Mongolians in the Yike Chao League, after the dictator of the Ordos Banner, Zhang Wenxuan, was assassinated on New Year's Day, the Suiyuan Mongolian Guidance Chief's Office planned to order Yangseng Zhabu and Qi Encheng to organize a joint regime.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Over a Thousand of Our Technical and Industrial Personnel Prepare to Return Home; Excellent Performance in Internships in the United States <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The United States has decided to assist China in becoming self-reliant militarily and economically, thereby becoming a guarantee of peace in the Far East and the security of the United States. This determination will be greatly strengthened in the coming months. In the past year, approximately 1,000 Chinese technical personnel and industrial and commercial professionals have interned in the United States and are now preparing to return home successively. They will use the methods they have learned with the help of the government and the industrial and commercial sectors in the United States to assist their motherland in solving urgent problems. These personnel were invited by the US government and factories and sent by the Chinese government to intern in the United States. There are both men and women, from bookkeepers to deputy directors of railway bureaus. They have been distributed throughout the country for internships. The US government is now preparing several special trains to transport them to San Francisco in batches, where they will board American ships to return home. Judging from the handling of this matter by the Chinese and American governments, this experiment can be considered a complete success. Most of the interns are graduates of domestic universities, and some have obtained degrees from American universities. They have studied what they are good at, and the internship locations are all well-known American factories and commercial institutions. According to the employing authorities, these interns are living up to expectations, and the plan is a complete success. Another group of people advocates adopting a reciprocal approach, as the United States also needs people who are familiar with China and the Chinese people in order to do business with them.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Misfortune of National Goods Factories <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Association held its first meeting since the victory of the War of Resistance yesterday. They decided to launch a "Love National Goods Movement." "Love National Goods" is an old tune from twenty years ago, but it is disheartening that it has to be replayed today, and even needs to be emphasized more strongly! Foreign goods flood the market, and almost everything one sees is "American-style equipment." National industries are on their last breath, and the closure of entire factories is already in sight. At this time, the significance of the national goods movement is even more important. If national goods have no way out, Chinese industry will not only be in difficulty, but will simply be driven to a dead end!</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the crisis facing China's industrial future in its editorials, but what is the use of loud appeals when they cannot even budge the slightest bit the people in charge of economic policy? We dare to say something painful: a hundred or a thousand appeals from national goods factory entrepreneurs will rarely reach the ears of the relevant authorities in the current situation where "bureaucratic capital" and "comprador policies" complement each other. Today, the plans of some high-ranking officials are just to import more cheap foreign goods, collect more taxes, earn more money, print more banknotes, and auction off more "extra" property. Why would they care about the disappearance of national goods, the decline of industry, or the collapse of the economy?</p>
<p>National industrialists, with the fire burning their eyebrows, urgently call for "Loving National Goods," thinking that if everyone uses national goods out of conscience, the industrial crisis can be reversed. In fact, this is too simplistic. Why has Chinese industry ended up in this situation today? The reasons are certainly very complex, but also very obvious. For example: (1) The domestic political situation is unstable and insecure, transportation has not yet recovered, freight is not smooth, and raw materials are expensive, directly increasing production costs; (2) The government has no overall plan to stabilize prices, resulting in small increases and small declines, endlessly cycling. The cost of living continues to rise, and wages also increase accordingly. Factories can hardly bear just the expense of paying salaries; (3) Labor disputes emerge endlessly. In addition to demanding improved treatment, workers strike at the slightest provocation, even resorting to mass violence, destroying property, and beating people. Discipline is abandoned, and efficiency is low, giving factory owners the feeling that "it is difficult to maintain operations and impossible to shut down"; (4) Foreign exchange is low, foreign goods are cheap, foreign goods taxes are light, and national goods taxes are heavy. Domestically produced finished products cannot compete with foreign goods. Coupled with the people's psychology of loving foreign goods, national goods have no room to stand. ... Looking at these points, we can see that prescribing the right medicine is no longer just about promoting national goods today.</p>
<p>The authorities in power are certainly well aware of the above reasons; especially the newly appointed Minister and Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, most of whom come from the private sector and may have even run their own businesses or worked as accountants for a long time. How could they not know the pain and the actual crisis suffered by the Chinese industrial sector? It is said that Minister Wang Yunwu plans to convene a national economic conference at the end of this month to find a way out for Chinese industry. Hopefully it will not just be a meeting without discussion, discussion without resolution, or resolution without implementation, merely wasting tens of thousands of millions of national currency. Of course, we certainly cannot expect the government to have a panacea for saving industry from misfortune, but in any case, the most practical way is to encourage exports without haggling over the amount of tariff revenue. This would certainly plug the huge loopholes to some extent. Only by first blocking this foreign goods craze that is formed by a steady stream can China's fragile industry have hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Having said that, the country belongs to the people, and reducing the use of foreign goods cannot rely entirely on the government's efforts. If everyone is of one mind and works together, perhaps the raging tide of China's collapsing industry can be reversed. Therefore, the "Love National Goods Movement" should ultimately be practiced by everyone. In the past hundred years, our country has repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, and its international status has plummeted. People in major cities often come into contact with foreigners, and unconsciously develop a psychology of admiring foreign goods and fawning over foreigners. The nation's self-esteem and self-confidence have almost disappeared. Especially in Shanghai, fashionable people prefer to be completely "Westernized," equipped with "foreign-style equipment," wishing they themselves could become "blue-eyed and blond-haired." Such a phenomenon was not surprising before the War of Resistance. But after the victory, China's international status should be different from the past. In terms of economy, we should also strive to revitalize industry and produce national goods, so that we can keep pace with the four major powers. The psychology of loving foreign goods should be changed. However, there is no plan for industrial recovery, and the takeover and bidding process has been going on until now. Not only is it impossible to lay the foundation for national industry, but existing factories may also be reduced to a pile of scrap metal. In addition, the government's financial and foreign exchange policies seem to only encourage the business community to order machinery from foreign countries, but instead end up being rejected. This is a mistake on the part of the government, and on the part of the people, they are restoring their bad habit of being fond of foreign goods. Who is doing this, and who is causing it? If everyone does not wake up today, and the government and the people do not quickly repent of their past mistakes, it will be too late to regret!</p>

<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] Kuang Mingkai, a traitor from Northern Jiangsu. Before the War of Resistance, he was a bandit leader with more than a thousand followers, who often kidnapped in counties north of the Yangtze River. After the War of Resistance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government moved to Xinghua. The bandit was arrested for theft and imprisoned under the alias Chen X. Before the case could be processed, Xinghua fell to the enemy. The bandit escaped from prison and contacted the Japanese invaders, organizing and expanding a team to serve as the head of the 87th Regiment of the 22nd Puppet Division and other positions. After the victory, the traitor immediately went to the Nanjing and Shanghai area to engage in activities. He was appointed as the captain of the county security brigade by Bu Zhenhai, the magistrate of Xinghua County (currently stationed in Taizhou). However, this was opposed by the gentry of the county. This spring, the title of captain of the rebel team was canceled. Disappointed, the rebel once secretly went to northern Jiangsu. Recently, he returned to southern Jiangsu and conspired with his bandits in Wuxi to destroy military warehouses. The logistics unit discovered and captured him. However, the criminal suddenly tried to escape while being escorted to the general warehouse for verification. He was shot and killed by the escorting soldiers. People in northern Jiangsu were all overjoyed when they heard the news.</p>

<p>[Wuxi] The local silk factory industry has recently been affected by the low-priced dumping of Japanese silk and the crisis of national industry. Therefore, there are no silk sales at all. Although the spring cocoons of each silk factory have been received this time, if 200 carriages are driven, more than 1 million yuan must be lost every day. Therefore, each silk factory has not started work. Even if they start work, they cannot survive due to various huge expenses. The Silk Factory Association convened an emergency meeting of the industry on the morning of the 15th to discuss ways to save the crisis. Four measures were decided: (1) Request the government to purchase raw silk from various factories at the current cost price with a legal profit added; (2) Allocate coal at the lowest price and give access to electricity to reduce labor costs; (3) Pay the loan interest in full after the expiration of the term, without deducting it in advance, to reduce unreasonable losses; (4) Appoint Gao Jingyu and others as representatives to be responsible for requesting relief matters.</p>

<p>[Reuters Moscow, 16th] The Soviet News Agency's telegram from Paris stated that the United States and Britain should immediately recognize Yugoslavia's legitimate demands for the port of Trieste at the Paris Conference in response to the Soviet Union's previous concessions. It is recalled that at the last Paris Conference, the Soviet representative made several proposals to facilitate an agreement on the disposal of Italian colonies and the issue of Italian reparations. Therefore, public opinion generally feels that the United States and Britain should show a spirit of understanding this time, especially recognizing the legitimate demands of the Allied country Yugoslavia on the Italian southern border issue and the port of Trieste. People in Allied countries generally feel that the issues facing the Four Powers Conference are not absolutely unresolvable, but only some newspapers in Britain, the United States, and France are extremely pessimistic about the Paris Conference.</p>

Truman's own plane, which will be sent to the Soviet capital, has been equipped with a pressure-regulating chamber to eliminate Stalin's auditory discomfort. Truman is even willing to leave the plane in the Soviet Union so that Soviet pilots can drive it back and forth between the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Allied Control Committee for Japan Passes Plan to Reorganize Japanese Rural Areas. Soviet Suggestion to Confiscate Japanese Private Land Opposed Unanimously by Chinese, American and British Representatives. <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Today, the Chinese, British and Soviet representatives of the United Nations Control Committee for Japan, passed a two-year plan to reorganize Japanese rural areas.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] At today's meeting of the Allied Control Committee, the Chinese and British representatives echoed the views of the United States and opposed the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union previously proposed to confiscate the larger estates in Japan, only giving half the value or even nothing, and then distributing this land to the farmers, as the basis for the previously proposed Japanese land reform movement.</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the U.S. representative, Acheson, read a prepared statement, criticizing the Soviet proposal of May 29. Acheson briefly stated the U.S. position: "Any proposal to change the ownership of land or other assets without paying the value is inconsistent with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration. This proposal is also contrary to the principle of encouraging and strengthening democratic tendencies within Japan, because they are contrary to the principles of democracy." Acheson emphasized that MacArthur is determined to distribute land according to the following principles, namely that the tillers own their land, and to eliminate all feudal ruling forces of the landlords.</p>
<p>After Acheson's statement was read, the Chinese representative said that he agreed with the British amendment, that is, the maximum amount of land owned by owner-farmers on the four countries, Honshu, and Kyushu islands should not exceed seven and a half mu, and the highest amount in Hokkaido's more barren areas should not exceed twenty-five mu.</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation then made a new proposal, but the proposal still advocated confiscating land from several classes without paying the value. Acheson immediately expressed his opposition, and the Chinese and British representatives also supported Acheson's position.</p>
<p>The suggestion made by the meeting to Master Mai will be to divide large tracts of land into smaller plots, and then sell them to farmers by way of loans.</p>

<h3 id="e42">De Gaulle Re-Enters the Political Arena Proposing a Bicameral Parliamentary System Granting Extensive Administrative Powers to the President Completely Opposite to the Communist Party's Claims. <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse France Bei, 16th] Today is the second anniversary of General de Gaulle's return to his homeland. A celebration ceremony was held here. General de Gaulle, wearing a brown brigadier general's uniform, participated in the grand ceremony, and the people cheered for him. After laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he went to erect a stone monument at the place where he returned to his homeland two years ago to commemorate the liberation of Bayeux. The inscription reads: On June 14, 1944, the residents of Bayeux regained their freedom, and General de Gaulle, the liberator of the nation, gave his first speech in this free place.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 16th] With the support of the Popular Republican Party, De Gaulle re-entered the political arena, and the Communist Party issued a statement today opposing any government led by the moderate Popular Republican Party. De Gaulle's political views were expressed at the celebration of the second anniversary of his return to his homeland in Bayeux in 1944, breaking his six-month political silence. De Gaulle advocated granting broad administrative powers to a non-partisan head of state; making him the President of France, establishing a bicameral system and a strong executive branch to defend democracy. It is said that the threat of dictatorship still exists in France, and the new constituent assembly should strictly separate the three powers of executive, legislative, and judicial. De Gaulle also mentioned his resignation as interim president in January of this year, saying that this move was to avoid being involved in political disputes and giving people the opportunity to manipulate legislation. De Gaulle's remarks have a significant political impact, and the constitution he proposed is almost the same as what the Popular Republican Party advocates, and completely opposite to the Communist Party. The Communist Party advocates a one-house parliament and an executive branch with no real power.</p>

<h3 id="e47">George Bernard Shaw Wishes to Be a Ceylonese, Says Ceylonese are the Direct Descendants of the Creator, Close Relations Between Britain and India Still a Distant Prospect <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The famous journalist Sabra interviewed George Bernard Shaw and asked if India's attainment of freedom would bring British-Indian cultural relations closer. Shaw said that the prospect of the two nations establishing closer relations is still very distant. The other questions and answers are recorded by Reuters as follows:</p>
<p>Q: "Leader Magazine" recently published an article by a Ceylonese writer, which stated: "Mr. George Bernard Shaw once said that if he were an Irishman, he would obtain a passport to Ceylon." Please explain why you chose Ceylon? A: I like the place and people of Ceylon; it was a profound first impression. Westerners generally recognize that the Ceylonese are the direct descendants of the Creator, which is the opposite of the mass-produced Western mobs.</p>
<p>Q: "Leader Magazine" also stated, "When the play "The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles" was performed in Colombo by Ceylonese actors, it was more popular than any masterpiece performed in Dublin. Why?" A: The audience's support is a fact that cannot be understood. Please ask the author of the article.</p>
<p>National Conflicts Seek Compromise</p>
<p>Q: The Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority in Ceylon often have conflicts. What is the solution? A: They must seek their own compromise, as the Scots, English, and Russians have done. Or like the compromise between the Catholic and Protestant in Ireland. Otherwise, they should fight each other to the point of elimination, which is impossible.</p>
<p>Q: In Hesketh Pearson's book "George Bernard Shaw", you said that the former Indian guru Jiddu Krishnamurti was the most handsome person you have ever seen. Besides his good looks, what else did he say? A: His refusal to become the "Star of the East" was an extraordinarily clever move. Those who are highly respected do not need any further public praise.</p>
<p>Indian Religions Need Reform</p>
<p>Q: Books such as Huxley's "Time Must Have a Stop" and Maugham's "The Razor's Edge" contain Indian religious ideas. Do you think this is a good phenomenon in British literature? A: This is an excellent phenomenon. It allows British writers to use their minds instead of just shouting slogans. However, Indian religions also need improvement. For example, temple decorations are too simplistic.</p>
<p>Q: What are your thoughts on modern British poetry? A: I have never read modern poetry, mainly because I am too old. Among poets, after William Morris, I only know John Masefield.</p>
<p>Q: After India becomes free, can British-Indian culture have closer relations? Is this relationship beneficial to the British nation? A: It is still very distant for these two nations to establish closer relations. I think you want me to give a detailed speech. You must hope so, no doubt. Goodbye.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: It is reported that Nehru has accepted the invitation from the Indian Governor-General and the British Cabinet delegation to participate in the interim government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] After the Governor-General of India announced that negotiations between the two major political parties on forming an interim government had broken down, he invited fourteen people to serve in the government today, including five members of the Congress Party, five members of the Muslim League, one chairman of the All-India Depressed Classes League, and representatives of other minority groups. The Governor-General's move is in accordance with the principle of equal numbers of both major parties, but the Congress Party may demand an additional representative from a minority group. The Governor-General stated that if his suggestion is accepted, the new people's government can be expected to be established around June 26. If rejected, he may invite representatives of all factions that have accepted the British proposal for Indian independence to form a government for trial.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] The Congress Party may make a final decision on the British proposal to establish an interim government by Wednesday. Gandhi said that the proposal is half light and half darkness. The opinions of the Congress Party on the proposal are roughly equal between those who oppose it and those who support it. The Muslim League is satisfied because it has equal representation for each Indian district. The interim government is composed of fourteen people, which is not much different from the fifteen people demanded by the Congress Party, and the increase in minority representation is also in accordance with the Congress Party's request. Of the fifteen people on the list submitted by the Congress Party, twelve seem to have been accepted by the Governor-General of India and the British Cabinet delegation.</p>
<p>Political Stalemate Expected to Break</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 16th] The hope of avoiding civil war in India may be strengthened tonight. Although powerful figures in the Congress Party Executive Committee opposed the British proposal, the party chairman Acharya Kripalani and the spiritual leader of the Indian people, Gandhi, have warned against rejecting the British proposal. Kripalani believes that in view of the food panic and economic crisis that India is about to face, we must be cautious and have a practical outlook.</p>

<p>[United Press, U.S. News Ship Appalachian, 17th] Wisconsin scientist Dr. Nolask said in a broadcast today: Stralov said that testing the power of atomic bombs on warships may cause the earth's crust to split, causing earthquakes, and all participants in the test will be destroyed. In fact, there is no such danger. The possibility of danger in the Bikini test is less than the chance of a meteorite one mile in diameter falling on the roof of the Empire State Building. The explosion of an atomic bomb is completely different from the nature of an earthquake. Such earthquakes as Stralov said have occurred hundreds of thousands of times on the Pacific seabed, but none of them has caused such a tragic scene as Stralov said, that is, seawater flowing into the earth's core, causing a huge explosion. In addition, the Bikini atoll is also the area in the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are least likely to occur. The country most prone to earthquakes in the world is Japan, but Japan was bombed by atomic bombs twice and did not cause earthquakes. According to Dr. Talask's broadcast, the purpose is to reduce the fear of the participants and their families caused by Stralov's remarks.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Far East International Tribunal Reads Out Historical Records of Japanese War Criminals, 26 Defendants Anxious <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Wei Tao-ming and Qin De-chun Attended the Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Far East International Tribunal Prosecutor's Office presented detailed records of the past history of the 26 major Japanese war criminals this morning to determine each criminal's responsibility for launching the war of aggression. The criminals were anxious in court. The documents on each defendant's desk were piled up like mountains. The defendants were busy taking notes when the prosecutors read out the historical records of each individual. The most calm among them was Iwane Matsui, who was charged with being responsible for the "Nanjing Massacre." Matsui looked quite thin and wore glasses. When his past historical records were read out in court, he sat in the defendant's box calmly, looked up at the ceiling, or stroked his beard and turned to look at the prosecutor. As for Osami Nagano, when he heard his name read out in his earphones, he immediately took out a pencil and began to take notes, not stopping until the prosecutor read out the name of Rear Admiral Oka Takazumi, the former director of the Navy Affairs Bureau. When the prosecutor read out Oka's past historical records, he closed his eyes and sat upright, frowning from time to time, indicating that he had vaguely forgotten the past. Before the prosecutor read out the record of Hiroshi Oshima, the former ambassador to Germany, his defense lawyer objected to this evidence, saying that the Japanese version of this record was only part of the documents submitted, and requested the entire translation. Court President Webb rejected this, saying that this would make Oshima's trial far more cumbersome than any trial in the world. When the court opened this morning, American defense lawyer McTeague applied to the court to add more defense personnel. He said that the administrative staff on the defense side had been reduced, and the court will decide on this matter later. Wei Tao-ming, our ambassador to the United States, stopped in Tokyo on his way back to China. He attended the hearing today with Qin De-chun, our Deputy Minister of National Defense.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Use Propaganda and Education Institutions to Promote and Instill Militaristic Ideas <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The court session was opened by telegram at 1:30 p.m. Prosecutor Helvey continued to explain the history of the defendants, followed by Prosecutor Hammack's initial presentation on Attachment A of the indictment, "Reorganization of Japanese Politics and Others into a Wartime System." It was pointed out that Japanese leaders used all propaganda agencies and educational institutions to promote militarism, making the Japanese people believe that Manchuria was Japan's lifeline and that it was Japan's mission to extend to mainland China. In order to foster the principle of nationalism among school students, defendant Marquis Kido completely revised the education system in 1937, which was later implemented by General Araki, to instill in young people a desire for war and a cruel hatred of the enemy through training and coercion. In addition, in 1939, organized and planned propaganda began, using newspapers, magazines, general publications, movies, and radio for extensive publicity. Those who opposed this propaganda were suppressed by all means. The police system played a great role in promoting this conspiracy. The conspiracy of the defendants is evidenced by the following events:</p>
<p>(1) Restricting the Minister of the Army and Navy to be served by active-duty generals and lieutenant generals, Imperial Edict of 1936. (2) The Tanaka Cabinet resigned in 1929 following the assassination of Zhang Zuolin. (3) The failure of General Ugaki to form a cabinet in 1937. (4) The resignation of the Yonai Cabinet in 1937. (5) The resignation of the Third Konoe Cabinet in 1941. (6) The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Hamaguchi in 1930. (7) The March Incident and October Incident in 1931. (8) The assassination of Finance Minister Inoue and Baron Dan in 1932. (9) The May 15 Incident. (10) The February 26 Incident. (11) The birth of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association in 1940. (To be changed to Zaoshe)</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Nugent Testifies in Court</p>
<p>The first witness for the prosecution, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Nugent, testified in court. Lieutenant Colonel Nugent taught in Japan before the war and is now the Education Director of MacArthur's Headquarters. According to his testimony, those who planned the war in Japan used schools to instill fanatical beliefs in young people, falsely claiming that Japan had a "sacred mission" to rule East Asia and would eventually realize "Hakkō ichiu" to control the world. Japanese schools not only used teaching materials that were inclined towards military goals, but also forced students to engage in field exercises, street fighting research, bayonet practice, and machine gun practice. This kind of training made students suffer from extreme nationalism and militarism, so that students loved the country as if they were drunk and knew only obedience. Tojo sat blankly during the previous interrogations, seemingly unmoved, but today he leaned forward, staring at the witness, looking quite concerned. (United Press above)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Two-Pronged Approach: Judicial and Military Organs Simultaneously Investigate Grain Loan Case; Three Grain Officials Detained Successively; Five Rice Merchants Released on Bail Except for Shao Jigaoy Kept in Detention <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Since Chairman Chiang personally issued a handwritten order and selected senior officials to come to Shanghai for thorough investigation, progress has been made in the grain loan case. As of yesterday, the entire case has reached its climax. In the morning, the District Court Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation hearing, summoning four suspected grain officials and eight related grain loan rice merchants. Among the four grain officials, except for Yang Xizhi, Special Commissioner of Shanghai Grain Administration, who has not returned from studying in the United States, and Wang Daren, Acting Director of the Grain Administration, who remained in the Garrison Headquarters and did not appear in court, Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Department, and Ren Xingyai, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Grain Administration, appeared in court in a timely manner. After the interrogation, Ren Xingyai, along with rice merchant Shao Jigaoy, was detained by the District Prosecutor's Office. Li Chongnian was released on bail after providing three million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, subject to being summoned at any time. Escorted by bailiffs to find a guarantor, he was about to complete the procedures at around 5 p.m. yesterday when the military authorities arrested Li in a lightning manner. At around 7 p.m., he was transferred to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters. Although Ren Xingyai is currently temporarily detained at the District Prosecutor's Office, it is reported that when necessary, some responsible persons of rice merchants related to grain loans will be summoned. The proceedings of the investigation hearings held yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters are described separately below:</p>
<p>District Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>Around 9 a.m. yesterday, the summoned grain merchants successively reported to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. The first to arrive were Xu Taiyuan, owner of Zhifeng Miscellaneous Grain Store, and Wan Molin, owner of Wanchangxing Rice Store and manager of Wanchang Rice Store, and Feng Genghua, manager of Xiechangtai Rice Store, among others. Around 10 a.m., Li Chongnian, Director of the Field Grain Department of the Ministry of Food (wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit), also arrived. Shortly after, Ren Xingyai, Chief of the Regulation Section (wearing a beige Zhongshan suit) arrived, carrying a bag of cookies. As he did not have a summons, he was stopped by bailiffs outside the gate of the District Prosecutor's Office. Only after the summons was verified at the summons office was he allowed to enter. The strictness of the gate control at that time can be seen from this. At exactly 11 a.m., all eleven witnesses and defendants were led into the courtroom by bailiffs. Prosecutor Wu Qihua began the investigation. The first to be summoned was Li Chongnian, followed by Ren Xingyai, and then Xing Songwen and Wan Molin, among others. The interrogation was completed at 1:30 p.m. The court ordered the detention of Ren Xingyai and Shao Jigaoy (manager of Fuhang Bank) (detained at the Masnan Road Detention Center). Li Chongnian was released on bail after providing three million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Wan Molin and Xing Zhigang (manager of Chenfeng Company) were each released on bail after providing ten million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Xu Taiyuan, Xing Songwen (manager of Jiangbei Company), Gu Yisheng (owner of Hushuntai Rice Store), and Zhu Shilu (owner of Xiechangtai Rice Store) were each released on bail after providing five million yuan in cash and a shop guarantee. Only Yang Runhui, the current manager of Wanchangxin Rice Store, and Feng Genghua were not required to post bail and were allowed to return home freely. After Ren and Shao were detained, they spoke with reporters. According to Ren, this matter was truly unjust to him and was completely influenced by the blind attacks of certain newspapers. If he had truly engaged in bribery and corruption, society could judge and execute him. During yesterday's interrogation, nine of the witnesses testified that they did not know Ren. Therefore, Ren Xingyai sighed to reporters: "I have an elderly mother in Nanjing, and my wife in Shanghai has three children. Because of this case, our lives will become problematic. Therefore, after I am released from prison, I will tell my children and grandchildren never to become officials again!" It is said that on the 22nd of this month, Section Chief Pan sent someone to instruct him to go to Beijing to "avoid the limelight." By the 24th, rumors were rife in the rice market that he had been arrested and escorted to Nanjing, but in fact, he was ordered to go to Beijing only on the 25th. While in Beijing, he heard that the District Court was going to summon him, so he rushed back to Shanghai, but the summons had already been sent to Nanjing, so he had not received it. He also said that Wang Daren was clearly arrested in his office by the Garrison Headquarters on the afternoon of the 14th upon the order of Chairman Chiang, but a certain newspaper claimed that he was arrested in a brothel. Ren is a native of Yixing, 33 years old, and lives at 53 Duolun Road. He appeared quite anxious after being detained. The other detainee, Shao Jigaoy, is a native of Shanghai, 31 years old, and lives at 63 Taoyuan Road. He was wearing a blue long gown with white thin stripes and looked very refined. He was quite patient in the detention center.</p>
<p>According to a prosecutor at the District Prosecutor's Office, because the current grain loan corruption case has a great impact on people's livelihood and society, and the Chairman has also issued a handwritten order to handle it strictly, if the office investigates and obtains conclusive evidence that fits the provisions of special laws, it will prosecute according to the special laws or try it by military law, and punish severely (by shooting!) to satisfy the people's wishes.</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters also interrogated Wang Daren all day yesterday and brought Wu Rongsheng, who was in custody, and the person in charge of the Changjiang Company to court for cross-examination. In the evening, it summoned fourteen rice merchants who had received grain loans. To clarify the division of authority of the authorities in handling the case, the reporter specially visited Zeng Zhaoyi, Director of the Military Law Office, yesterday. Zeng did not give a definite statement on this point, only saying that judging from the nature of the case, it could be tried by military law (Zeng also showed the military law provisions on the spot), and the most evidence and documents have been collected by this office, so the case may be transferred to military law for trial in the short term. However, because the case involves too many people, it is difficult to publish the interrogation situation at present. It is expected that the truth will come out in about ten days.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Zhang Daomin of the Grain Department's Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office Comes to Preside <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Administration of the Ministry of Food has been abolished and reorganized into the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office. Yang Xizhi was originally appointed as the director, and Wang Daren as the deputy director. Now, because Yang and Wang are involved in the grain loan corruption case, one has been arrested and the other is still in the United States. Therefore, the Ministry of Food has yesterday sent Zhang Daomin, a counselor, to Shanghai to preside over the Storage and Transportation Office, and may succeed to the position of director of the Storage and Transportation Office.</p>

<p>It was the first day of the joint general mobilization for epidemic prevention. Epidemic prevention personnel from the Health Bureau and other departments were dispatched separately to launch work. A summary is as follows: (1) The National Shanghai Medical College originally planned to send 80 professors and students yesterday to participate in immunization injections, but due to student exams, it temporarily changed to sending 30 teachers and students from the First Hospital Nursing School of the Chinese Red Cross Society, plus the Eighth Epidemic Prevention Team, to carry out injections. (2) Sixteen teachers and students from the Peiping Union Nursing School were assigned to immunization injections. (3) The above two items, together with more than 80 staff members drawn from the Health Bureau, members of the Epidemic Prevention Team, and doctors and nurses drawn from various health centers and municipal hospitals, totaled approximately 250 people, divided into 50 small teams, and went to more than 20 streets such as Suzhou Creek and Shajing Port, the eight city gates of the district and county, various parks, the four major company entertainment venues, and major factory areas to implement "forceful persuasion" for immunization injections, totaling more than 25,000 people injected. Today, injections and epidemic prevention propaganda will continue in the above-mentioned locations. (4) Four additional home disinfection teams were dispatched to disinfect various homes. (5) The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the American Red Cross provided a large number of syringes, alcohol, cotton, and needles, and the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan sent a quantity of vaccine for 100,000 people. (6) The headquarters of the U.S. Army stationed in Shanghai sent 10 trucks, the Executive Yuan sent 4 trucks, and the Police Bureau sent 2 ambulances, along with 5 vehicles from the Health Bureau, totaling 21 vehicles to transport epidemic prevention workers to and from their destinations. (7) Fixed immunization injection stations, undertaken by various practicing physicians, have been set up at 200 locations. The number of injections must be reported after one day. (8) Guo Keda, professor of bacteriology at the National Shanghai Medical College, together with Director Miao of the Health Laboratory of the Health Bureau, went to various epidemic hospitals to plan treatment, and starting tomorrow, they will implement temporary anal swab collection methods to culture cholera bacilli. (9) U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Lono reported by telephone that six naval medical officers would be dispatched in three days to participate in the city's epidemic prevention work, with the required equipment provided by themselves. (10) The Boy Scout Council will dispatch some Boy Scouts starting today, and the General Labor Union will酌调dispatch cadres to assist the Epidemic Prevention Team in its work starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Committee Moves into the Municipal Government</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei pays close attention to epidemic prevention work. In addition to expanding publicity, he is also actively strengthening the organization of the Epidemic Prevention Committee, mobilizing staff from various departments and soliciting specialized talent to carry out work. The committee has moved into Room 315 on the third floor of the Municipal Government starting today. The telephone number is 12410, extension 14. If people have inquiries or cholera patients need medical treatment, or have questions about home disinfection, they can directly request guidance from this office. According to the bureau's report, on the 15th of this month, there were 24 patients and 3 deaths. On the 16th, there were 11 patients, and there are no statistics for yesterday's patients, but 2 have already died. Therefore, the cumulative total is 272 cases and 28 deaths.</p>
<p>Banning Unhygienic Cold Drink Stalls</p>
<p>The Health Bureau and the Police Bureau jointly organized 12 patrol teams and began two weeks ago to advise small stalls selling ice cream and shaved ice on the roadside to stop selling these unhygienic foods. However, the general vendors repeatedly refused to repent. Therefore, at 4 p.m. yesterday, 40 to 50 vendor stalls were confiscated. Responsible persons from the Health Bureau's relevant departments and the second section of the Environmental Health Division earnestly lectured them, placing the ice cream and shaved ice on the ground. However, to take into account the livelihood of these vendors, the buckets and other utensils were returned, and they were ordered not to sell these cold drinks again in the future. It is also heard that the Health Bureau will also ban roadside cold noodle stalls.</p>
<p>Also, Mayor Wu gave a broadcast speech at 8 p.m. last night at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, urging citizens to cooperate and earnestly promote epidemic prevention plans. He said briefly that the emergency meeting on epidemic prevention had already approved the entire implementation plan, and was only waiting for all sectors to step up implementation. We must not be afraid, just do it. Fear is useless, action is effective, and so on.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The city's population survey has been completed by the Civil Affairs Department. Because citizens come and go不定, and there are frequent changes, and some people have not registered, the department will conduct a rigorous review based on the National ID card. Currently, except for the 11th district, where the ID cards have not yet been stamped, the rest are prepared and ready. All of them are expected to be issued by the end of this month. According to Vice Director of the Department, Mian Changquan, citizens who have not applied for the National ID card should do so quickly, because in the future, when food and supplies are allocated, they will be distributed according to the ID card, so citizens should not give up their rights. At the same time, with the ID card, a detailed investigation of the city's population can be conducted. Children under the age of fourteen are to be registered on their parents' ID card.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Yuasa Torakichi, former manager of the enemy Shanghai prisoner-of-war camp, abusing our prisoners, was sentenced by the military court yesterday.

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Among the "Three Old Sea Men" rebellious sons, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Lin Kanghou, except for Yuan, who has been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Lin, who has been tried once, only Wen Lanting is still in the investigation period at the High Prosecutor's Office and has not yet been indicted. However, it is heard that he has repeatedly told the prosecutor, "There is no need for more trials, just give a quick judgment." Therefore, he once refused to be tried. The office also summoned Wen Lanting from prison, intending to open a court for investigation, but unexpectedly he refused again, saying, "Trying is the same as not trying, why bother, you can judge as you please." Despite persuasion from all sides, he refused to leave prison. Later, it was rumored that the bailiffs would be forced to carry him to court, causing reporters to wait all day at the prison gate, intending to capture the scene of him being "forced into court," but he was not seen leaving until late. It is rumored that the reason Wen Lanting is doing this may be due to the stimulation he received from Yuan Ludeng being sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Advocating Thrift and Promoting Health: Everyone Eats Brown Rice <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu once said at a reception for the press that brown rice contains more abundant vitamins than white rice and is more nutritious than white rice. Why doesn't everyone eat brown rice? He also suggested to the government that the whole country should implement it uniformly, saving the manpower and material resources wasted on milling rice. We believe this is a valuable suggestion, but what is the difference in nutritional value between brown rice and white rice? To this end, the reporter went to "UNRRA" to interview a nutrition expert. The expert happened to be away on official business. Dr. Chen, who was busy preparing a report on the nature of food in various parts of the north, spoke with the reporter and handed the reporter a table analyzing the texture of white rice and brown rice. After reading this table, readers will be able to understand the nutritional value gap between white rice and brown rice. A translation is recorded below: (numbers are percentages)</p>
<p>Calories Contained in Every 100 Grams of Rice</p>
<p>Rice Type Moisture Protein Fat Carbohydrates Calcium</p>
<p>No. 1 White Rice 12.25 7.29 0.46 79.16 0.052 358 Calories</p>
<p>No. 2 White Rice 14.89 6.48 0.47 77.53 0.048 348 Calories</p>
<p>No. 2 White Rice 14.21 5.95 0.82 78.24 0.034 353 Calories</p>
<p>No. 3 White Rice 10.65 9.55 0.90 77.22 0.041 366 Calories</p>
<p>No. 1 Indica Rice 13.78 7.12 0.26 77.40 0.059</p>
<p>Brown Rice 16.95 6.68 0.35 74.98 0.059 338 Calories</p>
<p>It can be seen that brown rice contains more vitamins, especially vitamins B, A, and C, which are pitifully low in white rice.</p>
<p>Recently, at a municipal conference, a resolution was made to prohibit the milling of high-quality fine white rice. The standard for husking should be no less than five dou of brown rice from each shi of grain; the standard for machine milling should be no less than nine dou each of indica rice and durum wheat from each shi of brown rice. According to the research results of foreign expert Mr. Aufrey, eating brown rice is not only beneficial to health, but also increases the amount of rice by at least 10% to 15%. According to this expert's opinion, milled brown rice can be divided into the following three types: (1) Superior brown rice contains approximately 2% rice husks, 5% red rice, and 10% broken rice; (2) Medium brown rice contains approximately 2% rice husks, 10% red rice, and 20% broken rice; (3) Inferior brown rice contains approximately 3% rice husks, 15% red rice, and 30% broken rice. Because brown rice has a red skin to protect it, it takes more time to cook, but in fact, the fuel consumed is much less than the cost saved by brown rice. Because: 1. White rice needs to be milled two or three times more than brown rice; 2. White rice loses 10% to 20% more weight than brown rice.</p>
<p>The rice milled by villagers using stone mortars is more time-consuming but richer in nutrition than rice milled by milling machines. Recently, the municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Bean and Rice Industry Association to prohibit the milling of high-quality white rice. It is also stipulated that the cost price of rice should be based on the cost of grain, plus milling fees, transportation costs, and the indirect costs of retail stores. Looking at it this way, people in Shanghai will probably not be able to eat high-quality white durum wheat rice for long. (Ding)</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The "Central China Railway Company," which controlled the entire railway transportation business in Central China during the enemy-puppet period, was an institution jointly established by the enemy and puppets. Its "President," Zheng Hongnian, was interrogated yesterday morning at the Criminal Second Division of the High Court by Judge Xiao. Zheng is now 72 years old, a native of Panyu, Guangdong. He has successively served as the Deputy Minister of Finance of the Grand Marshal's Headquarters and the National Government, the Chief Quartermaster of the Guangdong Military Government, the Director of the Jingfeng Railway Bureau, and the President of Jinan University, among other positions. During the July 7th Incident, he was still a member of the Legislative Yuan. When Hong Kong fell in December of the 30th year of the Republic, he was unable to escape in time and was captured by the enemy and detained for more than a hundred days. Later, under the inducement of Wang Jingwei, he came to Shanghai to serve as the "President" of the "Central China Railway Company" until the victory. The institution was used to control transportation and promote aggression. Zheng's participation in the work clearly constituted collaboration with the enemy and treason. Therefore, after the victory, he was arrested by military agencies, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of traitor. Zheng, bald and with white hair, was clearly old. He argued in court yesterday that he did not participate willingly, but was arranged from Hong Kong to come to Shanghai to take the post. However, the company was a commercial institution, not a political organization. He had never attended the company's shareholders' meetings. All positions above the level of section chief in the company were held by Japanese, and he had no real power, like a puppet. Zheng fainted in court and requested to be returned to custody first. The court ordered a change of date for further interrogation after investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Ye Jiajun Discusses Methods for Improving Transportation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" City traffic is chaotic, and vehicles are often congested. The municipal authorities are eager to improve the situation and will convene a meeting of all relevant departments on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss improvement measures. A reporter met yesterday with Mr. Ye Jiajun of the Sino-American Transportation Improvement Research Committee. According to him, fundamental solutions to improve transportation, such as elevated trams and underground passages, are difficult to implement in the short term due to limited funding, materials, and experts. What can be done now are only stopgap measures. The most congested area currently is the central business district. The authorities plan to convert Henan Road and Sichuan Road into one-way streets: vehicles on Henan Road will only travel from south to north, while vehicles on Sichuan Road will only travel from north to south. In addition, the areas and times for rickshaws to operate will be restricted, and parking lots will be designated along the Bund, Suzhou Creek, and Avenue Edward VII for motor vehicle parking. However, detailed measures must await discussion and decision at the meeting on the 19th. Mr. Ye also stated that the number of traffic police is now fewer and their quality is also lower compared to the former concession era, and the authorities are working to improve this situation. Furthermore, some measures often encounter difficulties in implementation. For example, the conversion of Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road into one-way streets was agreed upon long ago, but has not yet been implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Solutions to the Housing Shortage in the City: Restrictions on Residential Housing Should Be Implemented; Xiang Xueru Submits Suggestions to Mayor Wu <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Xiang Xueru, director of the preparatory office of the Shanghai Social Service Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has formulated measures to address the housing shortage in the city and has submitted suggestions to Mayor Wu Guozhen. The main points are as follows: (1) Residential housing in the city should be restricted, with each person allowed no more than 100 square feet. All surplus housing exceeding the limit must be automatically rented out (calculated by population, not by household, because household sizes vary; calculated by square footage, not by room, because room sizes vary). (2) If residents are unwilling to rent out surplus housing exceeding the limit, the competent authority may levy a residential housing excess tax, with progressive tax rates. (3) Residents should not occupy taxable housing exceeding three times the prescribed residential area. (4) Residents should automatically rent out excess housing as prescribed or declare and pay taxes to the competent authority. (5) All vacant entire buildings and apartment owners in the city should automatically rent them out; otherwise, forced rental will be implemented. (6) All vacant land in the city should be used to build houses within a specified period; those who fail to comply will have the land requisitioned by the city government to build affordable housing.</p>

<p>General Zhu Shiming, Chinese representative to the Allied Council for Japan and head of the Chinese Mission in Japan, told reporters yesterday that the thinking of the Japanese people has improved after the lessons of this war. In the future, Japan will be permanently disarmed, and the so-called democratization and re-education work will achieve success after a considerable period. As for the issue of war reparations to China, the principles will be decided by the Allied Far Eastern Commission. Currently, Japan's domestic economy is experiencing considerable panic, and some factories have not yet been rehabilitated. There is a strong desire for the reparations issue to be resolved as soon as possible. In addition, there are currently about 30,000 overseas Chinese in Japan, mostly engaged in the hotel industry, and their lives are quite difficult. Mr. Zhu also mentioned that MacArthur's headquarters has allowed Japan to fish in international waters to alleviate the Japanese food shortage, which does not affect our fishing rights. Mr. Zhu explained that the situations of various countries are not the same, and our mission has a smaller number of people, currently about 100. According to news from the Mission in Japan, Division Commander Dai Jian has gone to Haiphong. It is not yet determined when our troops stationed in Japan will be sent to Tokyo. Zhou Maobo, Wang Shubei, Wei Yao, and other experts, a group of more than 20 people sent by the Resources Committee to Japan to investigate industrial equipment, are waiting for a flight to Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau Explains Responsibilities and Policies <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, hosted a reception for newspaper reporters at the Duchen Hotel yesterday afternoon to report on the purpose and work of the bureau. He said that the main purpose of the bureau is to supply materials under government loans, assist various ministries and commissions in purchasing goods abroad, and handle payment matters. However, all materials will be sold for cash in principle and included in the budget of each ministry and commission to balance the overall national budget. For example, cotton imported under the U.S. cotton loan will be handled by the China Textile Corporation, timber will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, and landing craft will be handled by China Merchants. To date, the bureau has only received U.S. surplus materials within China, including more than 30 ships and approximately 10,000 tons of military grain. Negotiations on Pacific War surplus materials have not yet concluded. For the distribution of military grain, public education personnel have priority. However, because the purchase price is extremely low, only one-quarter of the market price, it is easy to generate monopolies, resales, and other malpractices. Therefore, distribution is strictly handled according to the principle of punishing traitors, and only the individual is allowed to collect the materials. A trial run is being conducted in Nanjing and will begin shipping this Wednesday, with sales starting next week. After a month of trial runs, it will be implemented in this city. The Supply Bureau recently leased 981 new five-ton U.S. military trucks, which have already been unloaded. The leased materials also include hardware, materials, tools, etc., but all materials do not include military firearms because the U.S. Congress does not allow them to be sold.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Large Reservoir to be Built in Taiwan; Can Irrigate 6,000 Hectares After Project Completion <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[News from this city] According to news from the Taiwan Provincial Government, in the county of Gangshan, Taiwan, there is a river called the Agongdian River, which is 38 kilometers long and has a drainage area of 153 square kilometers, 80% of which is plain. It has great economic value, but the riverbed slope is relatively gentle and easily clogged, especially during flood season, causing serious damage. In 1934, it caused a major disaster, inundating more than 4,000 hectares, and public and private losses were incalculable. In view of this, the former Taiwan Governor-General began constructing a diversion channel in 1936, but with little effect. In 1942, a large reservoir project was started to build an earth dam capable of storing 45 million cubic meters of water. If it can be completed according to plan, it can not only regulate the water volume and prevent river flooding, but also provide irrigation and water supply.</p>
<p>The Japanese started this project as early as 1942, and by early 1945, it was more than half completed. Unfortunately, the project was largely destroyed by an extraordinary flood last summer. After the government took over, the Taiwan Provincial Department of Industry and Mining and the Public Works Bureau sent personnel to investigate several times and believed that it was necessary to continue construction. A project office was specifically established for this purpose. The total cost of the project is estimated at NT$42 million, to be completed in three years. The embankment section was started in May of this year, and the main dam section will be started after the flood season. If it can be successfully completed, it can not only reduce flood volume by 50%, but also irrigate 6,000 hectares of paddy fields and provide water supply for 30,000 residents. The national economy and people's livelihood will benefit greatly.</p>

<p>[This newspaper reports] Farmer Wang Tisheng, who lived in Lujiazhai, Jizhi Bridge, Nanhui for generations, married Wang Cihua five years ago (the woman is the younger sister of the ghostwriter Wang Xiaoyi, but from a different mother). Wang was addicted to opium and scorned by his neighbors, so quarrels constantly arose between the couple. Wang had a cousin, Wang Changgen, who is now 20 years old and from a well-off family. In 1942, he was robbed twice. Afterwards, Wang Changgen mistakenly believed that his uncle Wang Tisheng was involved. He conspired with his long-term worker Xu A'gen and gangsters Tang Haisheng, Xu A'jin, and Li Shaofu to murder Wang Tisheng. Four years ago, they lured Wang Tisheng out at night, tied his hands behind his back, and drowned him in the river. Since then, Wang Changgen (who was only 16 at the time) lived with his aunt Wang Cihua as husband and wife. Wang Xiaoyi heard about it, but lacked evidence and those people had great power, so he did not dare to report it. After the enemy surrendered last year, Wang Changgen secretly came to Shanghai with Wang Cihua and lived in hiding at 132 Fuyou Road, acting as husband and wife. Recently, Wang Xiaoyi finally found out and reported it to the Yemiao Branch. The police, led by police chiefs Bai Wenqi, Hong Yucheng, and Wang Wenjie, arrested Wang Changgen, Xu A'gen, and Xu A'jin after much effort. They confessed to their crimes. Accomplices Li Shaofu and Tang Haisheng died in a fight last year over the distribution of stolen goods. Wang Cihua's adultery was not prosecuted because the original informant did not want to pursue the matter. The interrogation of the three arrested suspects has been completed, and they will be transferred to the judicial authorities today for strict punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Constructing Shanghai, Facility Planning, Progress Status: Director Zhao Reports at the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The Shanghai Municipal Government held a memorial week yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Secretary-General He Dequi, directors of various bureaus, directors of various departments, and municipal government staff totaling more than 400 people attended. Mayor Wu led the ceremony. Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau reported, stating that the main work and the progress of the planned facilities of the Public Works Bureau from the restoration of the city last year to September were as follows:</p>
<p>Road Engineering</p>
<p>The city currently has a total road length of approximately 1,000 kilometers, including approximately 300 kilometers of asphalt roads, and approximately 200 kilometers each of macadam roads and cinder roads. During the enemy-puppet period, there was excessive damage. According to a survey at the time of takeover, it was estimated that 300,000 square meters of road surface needed to be repaired. In the past six months, due to the increased vehicle load, the road surface has been unable to bear the weight, and there has been continued destruction. Therefore, routine maintenance has been extremely difficult. In the past nine months, more than 500,000 square meters of road surface and sidewalks have been repaired and newly built. Currently, the monthly area of road surface repaired is approximately three times the monthly amount last year. Road surfaces that have been completely renovated include Wujiaochang, Jinji Road, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Jiaotong Road in the city center, the section of Zhonghua Road extending to the airport, Hongqiao Road, and the slow lanes of East Zhongzheng Road. For a permanent solution, it is planned to select major traffic arteries and gradually renovate them thoroughly.</p>
<p>Widening Road Surfaces</p>
<p>First, the main arteries will be opened up and widened, in principle to develop traffic in the suburbs, so as to solve the current abnormal phenomenon of concentration in the central area. In addition to the road widening project of the section of West Nanjing Road near the racetrack progressing smoothly, the opening of the boundary road westward through Xinmin Road to connect with Tibet Road, and the widening of Zhejiang Road are progressing slowly due to the difficulty of demolishing houses to make way for the road. However, widening Huashan Road so that the heavy vehicle track in West Shanghai can be connected from north to south is currently particularly necessary and is being actively prepared.</p>
<p>Widening Fees</p>
<p>In order to expand roads, the bureau must levy construction fees on the spot, as the city treasury is tight. The method has been resolved and passed by the Provisional Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The calculation method is based on the distinction between benefited area and benefited line. The benefited area is charged a fee based on the increased land price, and the benefited line is charged a fee based on the prosperity of the market. It is hoped that citizens will understand the purpose of this funding and the fairness of the method, and fully integrate with the government to assist in construction.</p>
<p>Flood Prevention and Flood Control</p>
<p>The city is low-lying, especially in West Shanghai. The inherent weakness is that the water pipes west of Guizhou Road and Huashan Road are approximately 12 inches in diameter. Whenever there is a rainy season and high tide, accumulated water is difficult to drain. The bureau has formulated an overall flood prevention plan, aiming to ensure smooth drainage and prevent backflow, with both short-term and long-term solutions. The estimated cost is 14 billion yuan and will take more than a year, which is beyond the current financial capacity. Even for short-term solutions, more than 2 billion yuan is needed. Currently, only the most urgent projects are being carried out first, at a cost of 800 million yuan. They will be completed in August of this year, and the autumn floods can be alleviated.</p>
<p>Bridges and Docks</p>
<p>The city has a total of 222 bridges, large and small, excluding small bridges that cannot carry vehicles, 16 bridges spanning the Suzhou River, and 35 municipal docks, with 27 in Puxi, all of which have been severely damaged. In the past nine months, they have been repaired in order. There is also a plan for a bridge over the Huangpu River to develop Pudong.</p>
<p>Affordable Housing</p>
<p>The city's housing shortage is serious. It is initially planned to build 3,000 buildings, with the city providing funds. Construction of 150 buildings on Damuqiao Road in Nanshi began on June 1.</p>
<p>Parks and Nurseries</p>
<p>The city has 13 parks that have been opened to the public. In the past nine months, the number of visitors to the parks has totaled 3.5 million. Five nurseries have been established, and 3,000 street trees have been replanted.</p>
<p>Repairing Seawalls</p>
<p>The total length is 28 kilometers. It is currently planned to repair them urgently, which will cost 3 billion yuan, to be borne equally by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and the Municipal Government. Repairs have already begun at the southern gap of the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach. Currently, only the first phase of 500 million yuan has been allocated by the Municipal Government. The difference is too great, and with rising prices, it is feared that the small amount will be difficult to meet the needs if it cannot be allocated on schedule.</p>
<p>Director Zhao also said that Shanghai is the only major commercial port in the East. In order to transform and construct a new Shanghai, the bureau has an urban planning design committee, hiring experts to conduct research and design. The bureau has a thorough and detailed survey of the city's road system and waterway system, and has completed 1/10,000 and 1/25,000 scale road maps of the entire city, which will be published by Zhonghua Bookstore and will be available soon.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Housing Allocation Committee Faces Many Problems; Occupants Found Using Gold Bars to Pay Rent; How to Handle? <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Shanghai Municipal Housing Allocation Committee held a subcommittee meeting yesterday afternoon. The issues to be discussed are scheduled to be presented at a meeting to be held at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM: (1) There are many requests from various agencies for housing allocation, and the order in which they should be allocated is unclear. (2) In the former Japanese residential areas, there have been cases of current occupants using gold bars to pay rent; how should this be handled? (3) The housing allocation applications previously submitted by various agencies often fail to report information according to the prescribed items, such as the number of employees and the number of repatriated personnel, which are not filled in accurately. Therefore, it is difficult to make allocations. A second application form has been issued. If it is not supplemented accurately in accordance with the regulations, it will be considered an automatic waiver of rights, and it is proposed that the General Assembly not allocate housing to them.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Real Estate Market: "Tong Yu Chun Wind" Proud Building. Ants Whispering About Price. Who Says Shanghai Has Few Houses? I Ask You, How Many Gold Bars Do You Have? <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>After this victory, it seems the whole world is experiencing a housing shortage, but Shanghai is different from London and New York. The housing shortage is causing business to thrive, so a "Real Estate Market" has emerged.</p>
<p>In the Jiangnan area, when real estate transactions are mentioned, everyone thinks of "ants." Actually, "ants" are real estate brokers. Why are they called "ants"? Because once termites get into a house, the pillars will quickly be eaten away beyond repair. These ants rely on houses for their survival; when the house is destroyed, the ants grow fat. In a way, real estate brokers and ants are indeed somewhat similar. Although this nickname is somewhat harsh, it is quite in line with the facts.</p>
<p>The so-called "Real Estate Market" is actually a gathering of these "ants." Strictly speaking, the organization of this market is neither rigorous nor is the pricing reliable. Rather than calling it a "market," it would be more appropriate to call it a "tea party." These tea parties are held in more than one place. Larger transactions take place at "Tong Yu Chun" at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road, while smaller transactions take place at the "Wind Proud Building" in the City God Temple in Nanshi. The gatherings take place in the morning. Although many of the "ants" are opium addicts, they will still arrive on time and are rarely late.</p>
<p>When business is booming, there will be five or six tables of tea drinkers in "Tong Yu Chun." They chat about everyday matters, no different from other tea drinkers, except that these five or six tables of people know each other better and are more intimate. They are very alert and will suddenly change the subject as soon as they notice someone listening to them.</p>
<p>Ants Speak, Good at Reading Faces</p>
<p>If everything is calm and there are no "suspicious figures" nearby, they will start talking about business. Who says Shanghainese have few houses! There are plenty of houses here, as long as you have gold bars. The tone of the conversation is roughly like this: "There's a two-story house on Longfu Road with a telephone, eight gold bars, needs to be quick." They are unwilling to reveal the address right away, for fear that someone will negotiate directly, causing the ant's commission to be lost entirely. There are seven or eight to a dozen such houses for sale each day. There are people whose job is to collect information about vacant houses from all directions and present it at the "market," so the ants go out and get busy. Once a transaction is successful, the errand runner also gets a commission.</p>
<p>The ants with larger networks are mostly managers or directors of so-called real estate companies or real estate departments of trust companies. They have "funds" available, and if they see a good house at a low price, they will sometimes advance the money themselves to "hoard" the house, add a little paint, or put in some cheap furniture, and when they "unload" it, they can make a lot of profit.</p>
<p>Smaller ants rely on commissions at the time of the transaction, also known as "one-tenth head," because the commission is roughly one-tenth. However, if the number of gold bars is really too high, then the commission will be less than one-tenth.</p>
<p>In addition to the commission, there is a difference between "transferring ownership" and "not transferring ownership." The person looking for a house naturally hopes to "transfer ownership" on the lease, to ensure their security, but if you want to go through this procedure, you need more gold bars, sometimes one-tenth, sometimes even more than one-tenth!</p>
<p>The level of the lease fee naturally depends on the location, the size of the house, whether there are sanitary facilities, whether there is a telephone, etc. According to current market prices, roughly in the French Concession, a one-and-a-half-story house with sanitary facilities costs about six gold bars, and if there is a telephone, it costs about one more bar, "commission and transfer of ownership are extra" (this is the most frequently heard sentence, in other words, the more you can raise the price, the more you benefit). Sometimes, it is possible to lease a house for four bars, but if the location is not remote, there will certainly be no sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>Highest Record: More Than Seventy Bars</p>
<p>The highest lease fee, it is said, was more than seventy bars, for some newly opened jewelry stores at the busiest intersection of Old West Gate in Nanshi.</p>
<p>However, Shanghainese are quite generous, but how many people can casually take out five or six gold bars? So, although the market is lively, few transactions are actually completed. Most of the opportunities for hoarding houses are created by so-called real estate companies and trust companies, because they can publicly advertise to attract customers, while ordinary ants, under the repeated orders of the authorities, no longer dare to show their faces as they did before.</p>
<p>I once asked a friend who was very familiar with those ants, "Since business is so slow, why not lower prices and sell off?" He said that the sub-landlords also have their own difficulties in asking for lease fees, because if you want to lease out a house, you have to guarantee that you can clear out the tenants so that the person who takes out the gold bars can move in immediately. But won't those subtenants also be experiencing a housing shortage after they move out? So those subtenants also want to receive gold bars before they are willing to leave, and they will take those gold bars to lease another house. The lease fee for the house is five or six gold bars, and even the most shrewd landlord can only get two or three bars at most, and the rest is given to the tenants and ants. (Ping Xiao)</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] According to a person from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, although China's international status has improved after the war, overseas Chinese have not yet obtained legal status due to their low level of knowledge. Therefore, the promotion of overseas Chinese education is urgent. In order to strengthen the overseas Chinese education institutions and ensure that the work can be carried out smoothly, the government transferred overseas Chinese education affairs, which were previously under the Ministry of Education, to the commission. Moreover, teaching materials for overseas Chinese education are being actively compiled and printed by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation. The Executive Yuan has also approved an increase in the funding for the restoration of overseas Chinese education to US$3.6 million. The focus of overseas Chinese education is to promote the glory of the motherland and train overseas Chinese in survival skills. Not only should schools be established in various places overseas to educate Chinese children, but also social education and cultural institutions for overseas Chinese should be established to achieve significant results. However, the current difficulties are the lack of awareness of overseas Chinese education among Chinese people and the lack of qualified teachers for overseas Chinese education.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhu Kezhen Talks About the Restoration of the General School of Zhejiang University and Will Persuade Professors of the Hangzhou Branch to Resume Teaching First <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhu Kezhen, president of National Zhejiang University, previously went to Guizhou to preside over the restoration of the school. He has now returned to Hangzhou after completing his official duties. The reporter visited him and was told: The General School has five colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering, as well as research institutes. There are more than 1,600 students in the main division, more than 400 students in the attached middle school division, and 400 faculty members. This time, upon receiving the order to restore the school, the ministry allocated 370 million yuan for restoration, 150,000 yuan for each professor, and 120,000 yuan for each student. Therefore, most of them have recently left Zunyi and traveled by car to Changsha, then by boat via Hankou to Shanghai and Hangzhou. However, due to difficult transportation along the way, only more than 700 students have arrived in Shanghai. After the restoration of Zhejiang University, in addition to the above six colleges, there are also the Teachers College in Hangzhou and first-year students in the Colleges of Arts, Sciences, Engineering, and Agriculture. It is planned to add a College of Medicine next semester, so the school buildings are far from sufficient. Although the Ministry of Education has allocated 800 million yuan for construction, it is only enough to build college buildings on the original site of Huajia Pond. The remaining funds of several billion yuan are still needed, and it is planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Education to find ways to raise funds. As for the entire faculty and students of the General School, it will take until mid-October to arrive completely, and the next semester will be extended to November 1. The professors of the Hangzhou Branch stopped teaching due to unreasonable salary adjustments. The author has appealed to the Ministry of Education in Beijing, and Minister Zhu is very concerned and promised to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan meeting. Since the end-of-semester exams are approaching and the holiday will begin on the 7th, it is requested that the representatives of the professors' association be persuaded to return to Hangzhou and resume teaching first in order to maintain the students' studies.

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Special Dispatch] The printing industry has a direct relationship with education and culture, and is an invention of our country, but due to the past tradition of apprenticeship and the lack of good education and research facilities, it has lagged behind. The printing industry is listed as an important sector in Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan. During the war, the Ministry of Education successively prepared to establish one national paper making and printing vocational school each in Sichuan and Jiangxi. Due to various wartime restrictions and difficulties, the content and equipment were mostly simple and had to be considered temporary in nature. Now that the capital has been returned, Nanjing is once again the political and cultural center. In order to promote the basic tools of culture and meet the needs of national construction, it has recently been decided to establish another National Advanced Printing Vocational School in the capital, and to purchase all the latest printing equipment from Europe and the United States, and to attach a complete printing factory. Yu Guoyi has now been appointed as the director of preparations. Yu has studied printing in the United States for more than ten years, and has also studied printing in Germany and other European countries. The development of the school is promising. [Yu]</p>
<h3 id="e110">Primary School Curriculum Research Forum (8): Support for Exempting First Graders from Arithmetic <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After reading Shang Wu's article "First Graders Should Be Exempted from Arithmetic" in this column, I felt that he is a meticulous person and that he can understand the minds and intellects of young children in great detail. I very much agree with his suggestion because I have also experienced this situation.</p>
<p>My second son, Lesheng, is my most ideal child. He has an innocent and lively attitude, a strong and lovable physique, and an exceptionally clever mind. He is not yet four years old this year and is still eligible to receive the relief center's milk powder. Because of his superior mental abilities, I taught him to recognize characters before he entered school. Two months ago, I bought a box of color-picture block characters at the bookstore, and during my spare time from work, I taught him four characters every day. It only took me about ten minutes to teach him these four characters, and he remembered them well. Moreover, he could distinguish between characters with similar strokes, such as "力" (lì, strength) and "刀" (dāo, knife), "瓜" (guā, melon) and "爪" (zhuǎ, claw). He has now recognized over two hundred characters. However, I discovered a very strange thing, which is that these two hundred characters include the ten numerals. Except for the numbers "一" (yī, one), "二" (èr, two), and "三" (sān, three), which he did not confuse, he had a very difficult time remembering the other seven numbers from "四" (sì, four) to "十" (shí, ten). Sometimes he would read "五" (wǔ, five) as "七" (qī, seven) or "六" (liù, six) as "八" (bā, eight). When asked about "九" (jiǔ, nine), he would shake his head. After being reminded, he would forget again. Once, I was reviewing with him, but as soon as I asked about the ten numerals, he became confused. When asked about "六" (liù, six), he immediately shook his head without pretense. I saw six teacups on the tea table and immediately had an idea. I picked up three teacups and asked him how many there were, then picked up another three teacups and asked him how many there were. He answered the two "three" counts, but I asked him to add these three teacups to those three teacups, and he still couldn't do it. Later, after I added them for him one by one, he reluctantly answered the number "six" that I had asked him.</p>
<p>If even a child who is considered intelligent has such difficulty recognizing numbers, how can we blame Shang Wu's son, Ling Ling, for not being able to do addition and subtraction! At the same time, I understand that when a child's intellect is not yet fully developed, teaching him to recognize characters should be entirely with nouns, and they should be concrete. Because he can see, hear, and touch concrete things at any time, which suits his experience and makes them easy to remember. For example, when I teach Lesheng the character "鐘" (zhōng, clock), he easily remembers it. This character "鐘" (zhōng, clock) has a total of twenty strokes, which is three strokes less than the total number of strokes of the ten numerals, but compared to each numeral's noun, it is already close to abstract. When you hold up three fingers, it's called "三" (sān, three), but three teacups are also called "三" (sān, three), and even three large houses are called "三" (sān, three), which makes the child feel strange and makes it difficult for him to remember. When we suddenly see this example, it seems that the children in the world are too stupid, how can people know that raising three fingers is three, and three water houses do not know is three? We must know that children are children after all, and their understanding is not as good as that of adults. This is like a mathematics master who is proficient in triangles, geometry, algebra, and arithmetic. When he goes to the vegetable market to buy meat, no matter which butcher says how much to buy, the butcher cuts it off with a knife, which is the amount of weight he wants to buy, and the price is also blurted out without thinking, which is very accurate. When this butcher cuts meat, he does not need to prove it with triangular geometry, and when calculating the price, he does not need to write calculations with algebra and arithmetic. If you are joking, if you want the mathematics master to be a butcher and calculate the price, you can borrow paper and pen, or solve it with a lot of brainpower, but if you ask him to cut meat, it will be good for him, he can’t draw dotted lines, measure angles, and cite theorems on the meat, and finally cut the piece of meat to pieces, and still not get the weight. What is this for? The mathematics master has no experience in cutting meat, just like children can't do arithmetic, they feel that this is strange.</p>
<p>Therefore, I support Shang Wu's suggestion: "First graders should be exempted from arithmetic." It is best for first graders to be given a "counting" concept while drawing or playing games to prepare them for future arithmetic instruction. (Cai Renheng · Thirty-five · Six · Ten)</p>

<p>[Our Hefei Report] All the students of the Provincial Anhui College and the Tunxi Branch College in Southern Anhui, upon hearing the news that the Ministry of Education and the Preparatory Committee of the National Anhui University had resolved to establish the National Anhui University at the original site of the former Provincial Anhui University in Anqing, to take over the books and instruments of the Provincial Anhui University, and to discontinue the Provincial Anhui College next semester, were greatly shocked and repeatedly petitioned the Provincial Government to reorganize the Provincial Anhui College into the National Anhui University to avoid starting from scratch. Subsequently, Chairman Li reached a compromise and telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that the students of the original departments of Anhui College be incorporated into the National Anhui University. Wang Shaolun, Director of the Anhui Department of Education, Cheng Yansheng, President of the College, and Ye Yuanlong, Director of the Relief Department, also went to Beijing to request a merger with the Ministry of Education. The Preparatory Committee of Anhui University also held a meeting in Beijing and resolved to pass the merger principle, but the merger method has not yet been decided. Now, Director Wang Shaolun returned to Hefei on the 9th. According to him, the matter has been decided by the Ministry of Education and the Preparatory Committee of the National Anhui University. Students of Anhui College can transfer to the National Anhui University according to the transfer procedures. If students still wish to study at the College, Anhui College will continue to operate in the next semester. The books and instruments of the former Blood-Soaked Battle Established Anhui University will be distributed and used by Anhui University and Anhui College. The National Anhui University will still use the former site of the Provincial Anhui University in Anqing and will start school in the autumn. (Chao)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Nationally Designated Textbooks; Unified Printing, Unified Sales, Large Supply; Children's Bookstore and Four Other Companies Also Participate; Vigorous Crackdown on Pirated Editions Everywhere Recently <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The seven-company joint supply office for national textbooks has recently moved from Chongqing to Shanghai. It has been decided that textbooks for the autumn semester nationwide will be printed locally and supplied in large quantities in Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, where supply committees will be established separately. Supply teams will be set up in each province and city. In addition to the funds that have been raised and advanced by each company as much as possible, negotiations are also being held with the Four Joint Banks for loans. As June is nearing its end, the China Bank has been requested to release the loan in advance as an emergency measure and will send personnel to audit various uses to ensure sincerity and credibility. Taking Shanghai as an example, it is estimated that the number of books produced this autumn can reach at least five times that of last autumn. The number of prints in other recovered areas is even greater. It is expected that the book shortage situation this autumn will not occur. In order to make supply and demand more appropriate, in addition to adopting the unified printing method, the office also intends to adopt the unified sales policy as much as possible. It has recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to the local education departments to pre-order books directly from the local branch offices. For areas where transportation is difficult, please also assist in solving the transportation problems. Those who pre-order from the schools can enjoy preferential prices, but they must pay a portion of the book price in advance, or the local bank is responsible for guaranteeing and ordering on their behalf so that they can be printed and shipped on time. It is heard that unified sales contracts have been agreed in several places. The office is now hiring lawyers to contribute copyrights from each company in accordance with the contract of the Ministry of Education, and actively carry out the crackdown on pirated editions in various places in accordance with the Ministry's order to save the finalized proof paper type of the subject. The office will also demand compensation for various losses from the infringing groups, printing factories, and vendors in accordance with the law. It is also heard that the Children's Bookstore, China Cultural Service Society, Independent Publishing House, and Victory Publishing Company have also participated in the supply.</p>

The intensity and excitement of the competition at that time can be imagined. The person in charge of the Football Committee announced yesterday: The ticket prices remain the same, but the ticket sales time will be brought forward to 2:00 pm and will still be sold at the City Stadium. The competition time has also been changed to start at 4:30 pm. In addition to the Fuxing Road gate, the Shaanxi South Road gate will also be opened at the entrance of the Recreation Ground. Please pay attention to the audience. Today's match will be refereed by Wu Shouheng, and the line judges will be He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang.</p>

<p>Lineups of the Two Teams</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Star East first defeated the British Navy, then captured the Western United, and then defeated the Jews three times. Last weekend, it won against Donghua with a score of five to two. The strength is strong, and the momentum is grand. Today, they will meet their powerful enemy Qingbai. They will definitely do their best to win the game. In terms of lineup, there is no change in the front five tigers. The midfielder Liu Songsheng moves to the left, Guo Yingqi injured. The position of right front, old tune is repeated, the striker is sharp, the defender is firm, the arrangement is quite ideal. Qingbai is still the original team. Goalkeeper Qin Bigao and Huang Shijie will each play half a game. The defender Yan Wu's file, as like as two peas, is active. It is feared that it will be difficult to cross the final barrier. The key to today's victory or defeat lies in the respective methods of the Qingbai striker and the visiting army's defender.</p>
<p>Today's Winner or Loser</p>
<p>Today's Qingbai is undoubtedly the biggest strong enemy of Star East. The number of wins or losses is difficult to predict. Analyzing the strength, the high and low are very small. With Star East's neat, brave, quick, skilled, and final long-term strength, it is not unreasonable to say that it can win Qingbai. However, Qingbai's defender can be said to be two iron gates, and the midfielder is no weaker than Star East, then Star East's attack, whether it can be as desired, is also a question. Therefore, whether Qingbai's striker can break through Star East, the victory or defeat can be determined, and the strength and physical strength are also important factors in today's victory or defeat.</p>
<p>Shanghai League Game Will Not Be Held</p>
<p>The Football Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon. Due to the urgency of time and the hot weather, the game of Star East in Shanghai decided to end with the game against Hualian on the 21st. The game against Shanghai United will no longer be held. The team is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 23rd and return to Shanghai on the 25th. After that, the charity game will be decided after the team returns to Shanghai. The Football Committee has received many letters from various charity organizations in the city requesting to hold football charity games in recent days. Yesterday, the Star East team also received a joint letter from Fan Shaozeng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Du Yuesheng, and Gu Jiatang, inviting the team to have a triangular cycle charity game with Western United and Qingbai. The ticket income will be used to relieve the victims in Henan and northern Jiangsu. The Football Committee is discussing whether to hold it.</p>

<h3 id="e122">After the Ministry of Finance Announced That It Will Continue to Repay Principal and Interest as Usual, the Black Market Price of Public Bonds Plummets <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Most of the industry did not agree, and the news that the Ministry of Finance has announced that it will repay the principal and interest of the pre-90,000 yuan debts as usual from July 1 has already been announced. The black market sentiment has been hit hard, and many parties are rushing to sell. The unified C opened in the morning and plummeted by more than 1,000 yuan, reaching 1/4 of the value, which was still difficult to find a counterpart. It only traded when it fell to 3,000 yuan. The short side covered and once saw more than 3,300 yuan. The bulls added to close the position, and the halfway meeting fell by 2,200 yuan before it was maintained. The short side realized that the situation was too serious, and stopped at the right time. A certain bull on the seventh floor even added more codes, and gradually recovered to above 3,000 yuan before the end. As a result, the closing price plummeted by 1,500, A and B fell by 800 yuan, 850 yuan, and Wuzhua also fell by 800 yuan. With such organization and such a way of doing things, retail investors and foreign funds should wake up as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Gold Price Stable <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Huo Chi was extremely stable yesterday, opening at around 1.88 million. The US dollar was weak, and the gold price was inevitably affected. It fell from 1.885 million to 1.86 million. Afterwards, the US dollar gradually improved, and the decline was maintained. The central allocation was 150 bars, the price was 1.87 million. Since then, there have been fewer activities and limited transactions. The overall trend has been sluggish, and it is still hovering within 1.88 million at noon. In the afternoon, the rise of the US dollar rebounded, and the gold price was also brought up to around 1.89 million. As a result, it rebounded by more than 10,000 compared with last Saturday. Jewelry gold rose from 198,000 to 200,000. Silver and silver dollars were stable. The interest rate for informal lending ranged from 12 cents to 15 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Chinese Stocks Are Cautious at High Levels; All Close at the Bottom Price; Yongshen's New Shares Have Already Risen <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks are also wary because they have risen too much. Yongshen's new shares started trading, and the opening price actually shouted a new high price of over 700 yuan. Outsiders could not get rid of this price. 675 yuan was the official high price. Soon after, the sales pressure was small. Other stocks were even worse, and almost all closed at low prices. The small stocks were even more tired. As a result, the closing price of Yongshen Meiya fell by about 50% or so before the closing, Jingfu Xinguang Qinxing each fell by less than 10%, the unpopular mid-sized stocks fell slightly, and the small stocks fell by about 50%. The veteran stocks all showed an oversupply, and the buyers were on the sidelines. Foreign stocks were also affected by the emergence of the old ones. They were afraid that the yarn would enter the 11,000 yuan range as soon as it entered the market, and it continued to fall after opening, lacking maintenance. The supply still exceeded the demand. Except for Yeguang, which did not have many chips and was in good condition, the others were loose. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yeguang was flat, and Yisha and Jardine fell by about 50% or so. British Union and small stocks fell by 10% to 15% or so.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Yarn Market Sees Both Glory and Dishonor; Spot Cotton Transactions Are Generally Weak <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was developed by the Guangdong gang, and they were particularly fond of 20-count Double Horse yarn, which led to the sudden increase of more than 70,000 units of spot yarn. Other large yarns such as Golden Rooster Dafa also followed up by 30,000 to 40,000, but the medium and small 10-count yarns were very mediocre, and the 16-count yarns also lacked vitality. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, and there were supplies for sale from 1 count to 100 counts, and the price was 20,000 to 40,000 lower than the previous bid, and the buyers were quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton market was closed for holidays, and there were no telegrams. The local spot cotton market was generally weak. It was heard that Hua Hao had exchanged 12 dan and 60 jin of Pengjiapo cotton for a package of Dasheng Factory's 20-count Hong Kui Xing yarn, and there were about three or four packages of exchange transactions. It is said that the price of Hong Kui Xing was 1.19 million yuan. Apart from this, there were no openings from other factories, and only the industry had a few embellishment transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Artificial Silk Breathing Greatly <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Morning and Afternoon Difference of Sixty to Seventy Thousand Yuan</p>

The final asking price in the afternoon was 1.57 million yuan, a large increase of 10,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brand No. 120 (with luster), such as "Beauty," had a minimum price of 1.4 million yuan in the morning, later reaching 1.44 million yuan, and finally an asking price of 1.47 million yuan.

No. 75 Jin Ji semi-luster had a minimum price of 1.55 million yuan in the morning, later reaching 1.58 million yuan, and an asking price of 1.6 million yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, the price difference between morning and afternoon for artificial silk was as high as 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, because the market was filled with rumors of selling off in the morning, leading to a price drop at the opening. In the afternoon, there was no shortage of bargain hunters, and the asking price gradually increased. 78-filament factory silk with high uniformity opened at 2.33 million yuan. 72-filament 3-grade new single medium-grade silk was traded at 2.18 million to 2.2 million yuan. A user's silk asking price was not much different from last Saturday. Single-piece goods of 30-filament warp had a price of 1.8 million yuan.

<p>(Reuters, London, 17th) According to the annual report of the California-based Mobil Oil Company, Saudi Arabia's oil production this year may reach 7 million tons. In 1945, the region's production was 3 million tons, and in 1938 it was 67,000 tons. It has now become the fifth largest oil-producing region in the world, second only to Iran.</p>
<p>Due to the hasty preparations during its establishment, the China Petroleum Corporation under the Resources Committee is still continuing to advance various matters that need to be handled after its establishment. Currently, the company is strictly evaluating the movement of personnel in oil fields and oil refineries across the country, and is also actively promoting three plans: (1) preparing to establish oil refineries in various regions; (2) exploring oil production in various regions, mainly in the Northwest and Taiwan; (3) increasing and improving the production of existing oil fields. It is reported that due to inconvenient transportation recently, no oil has yet been shipped to Shanghai for supply.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The Mercantile Bank, in its annual report, extended its condolences to all staff in the former occupied areas of the Far East, and stated, "This year, our report is able to include the latest figures from branches in China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Malaya, so the figures listed this time are more accurate than in the past. In China, branches in Shanghai and Tianjin have already begun operations, and representatives have also been dispatched to Hankou and Qingdao to prepare for resumption of business. Britain and the United States abandoned the unequal treaties in 1943, and other countries followed suit, so the bank is now subject to Chinese laws and tax systems. The Shanghai foreign exchange market has been revived since the Central Bank announced management measures on March 4. However, foreign exchange is allocated to necessary imports of medicine. Under this circumstance, needed import businesses have benefited, and the exchange rate is relatively stable. However, ultimate stability depends on the resurgence of exports and the balance of domestic revenue and expenditure."</p>

<p>Cloud ear fungus and preserved mustard greens have similar supply and demand, and are relatively active. Hunan lotus root lacks momentum to rise due to the influx of Raozhou lotus root. Dried scallop prices are high and sales are sparse, due to scarce inventory, and the trend is firm. Rapeseed, bottle gourds, star anise, and sago rice are supplied in a steady stream, with scattered sales, so prices are falling. Mushrooms, dried shrimp, Job's tears, and agar-agar are in demand due to the season, sales are brisk, and the trend is firm. Dried whitebait is also showing signs of strength. Other goods are generally stable.</p>

<p>Surplus Must First Supply Southeast Asia</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 16th] Siam, a small country in Asia, had a rice surplus of 1,500,000 tons last winter. At a time when Asian countries need about 3,000,000 tons of rice to relieve famine, this surplus is urgently needed by other countries. In January of this year, Britain signed an agreement with Siam stipulating that Britain would control Siam's surplus of 1,500,000 tons of rice. Britain needs this rice to supply Burma, Malaya, and India. China is also suffering from famine this spring and is eager to obtain a portion of this surplus rice from Siam. However, Sir Kellan, Special Commissioner of Singapore, stated that Siam's surplus rice is "not excessive" in view of the needs of all Southeast Asian countries. In any case, transportation is a huge difficulty. This statement indicates that besides exporting to British colonies, there is no desire to transport rice to other countries.</p>

<p>Industrial oils and fats have seen sparse transactions in recent days, due to weak supply and rising prices at the source. Users here are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the sudden price increase.</p>
<p>(Taipei News) The former Bank of Taiwan was formally opened for business on May 20 after reorganization, acting as an agent for the Central Bank's business in Taiwan. It is reported that six other banks, including the Industrial Bank of Japan, Sanwa Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and South China Savings Bank, will also be reorganized into local banks.</p>

<p>Yesterday, registered rice arrivals in the city were over 5,000 shi (unit of volume), but the market situation remained unchanged. Flour fell back 300-400 yuan, wheat bran also slightly 200 yuan. Oil prices plummeted 2,000-3,000 yuan with the influx of goods from various sources. Soybeans are also trending towards stability. Beans saw a surge in arrivals from various places, with prices falling another 500-600 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes also weakened by 200-300 yuan. Weak rural consumption and slow sales of wheat, with slightly more arrivals, led to a price decline of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the tea market has been strongly supported. Red and green teas, both in local stores and from the Suzhou-Yizhou area, are being sold continuously. It is also reported that the tea market in Suzhou is extremely optimistic. Mid- to low-grade goods require about 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), so those holding goods in this city are all hopeful, and their willingness to sell is twice as strong as before. Supply is frequently decreasing, and the situation is regrettable due to demand exceeding supply. In terms of prices, Wenzhou Mingchun new Qiqiang has risen sharply again compared to last week, and other varieties are also sharp. As for the foreign tea market, British merchants Jardine Matheson and Concordia have sent senior Chinese personnel to Fuzhou to operate.</p>

<p>The coal market is experiencing quiet trading, and industry players are grumbling. Only those urgently needed are showing some interest, with very scattered transactions. It is rumored that some of the newly arrived Yangquan coal blocks have a strange odor when burned, affecting sales, and many cargo owners are eager to sell, leading to continued weakness in prices. Hongji and Jiaozuo coal blocks are of better quality and have fewer arrivals, and sellers are not as eager to sell, so prices remain stable. Sales of bituminous coal are also quiet, and market prices remain unchanged. Coal balls and firewood remain stable.</p>

The guild's morning benchmark price for medium-grade white sugar was 92,300 yuan, then rose to 94,000-94,500 yuan. The afternoon price rose further to 95,000 yuan. The morning price for Shuang sugar was 91,000-91,500 yuan, rising to 93,000-94,000 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 4,000-5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price for local cotton white sugar was 100,000 yuan. Hao goods (well-known brands), Shantou Qing was offered at 73,000-74,000 yuan, Mianchi at 93,000-94,000 yuan, and slightly lower at 90,000 yuan, totaling over 200 bags.

<h3 id="e137">Summer Fabrics and Woolens All Fall <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Summer fabrics and woolens all fell at yesterday's public tea party. Everything from Valentinos, Palaces, feather yarns, four-ply woolens, white pique, white Zhigong, Fassco, Shek Siting, and Ma Gao cloth saw reduced asking prices. Generally, cargo owners were willing to cut prices to sell off inventory, as most of the peak selling season has passed. If they were to raise prices again, the goods would inevitably be shelved. After a certain period, new orders would inevitably arrive in port, simply adding to interest expenses. However, buyers, aware of this situation, showed little interest, leading to a downward trend. However, retail sales have not yet shown any significant price reductions.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, news reports that the Central Bank had notified designated banks not to accept US dollars to offset US exchange quotas caused considerable panic among holders. Immediately, they slashed prices to around 2,550 yuan, pressing down to below 2,500 yuan, creating an extremely chaotic situation. Operators widened the buying and selling spread on small quantities, at one point differing by 100 yuan. Later, the situation stabilized somewhat due to bargain hunters, recovering to around 2,560 yuan, struggling around 2,580 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, cotton settlements poured in, rising to around 2,630 yuan, a net increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous close. The forward spread of 744 yuan was compressed to around 718 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars saw increased demand from importers and also recovered 5 yuan, with the Hong Kong exchange rate at 465 yuan, and the Indian exchange rate at 570 yuan, both seeing selling pressure. The US exchange rate remained flat on the surface but stagnant underneath. The Central Bank issued a notice on the 15th regarding</p>

<p>[Guangzhou News] Zengcheng Xiyuan Temple's "Gualu" lychee is a Tang dynasty relic. Due to several vicissitudes, cultivation was neglected, and one of the original three branches withered, reducing fruit production. In the spring of 1937, the agricultural colleges of "Zhongda" and "Lingnan" Universities, together with the Guangzhou Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Station, sent agricultural experts to the temple to conduct detailed research, apply fertilizers, and use scientific irrigation. After a few months, new branches thrived, and more fruit was produced. The temple was then turned into a park, with "Fragrant Lychee" planted throughout for visitors to enjoy. After the occupation, the trees in the park were destroyed by the enemy. Fortunately, this tree remained unharmed. During the Chongqing period, every year the fruit was harvested and seized by soldiers and presented to enemy leaders. Last year, the harvest was 128 lychees, and this year only three and a half jin (unit of weight). The current selling price is 100,000 yuan per jin, or 5,000 yuan per lychee. A month before the fruit ripened, customers had already registered in advance, and later customers were willing to pay 150,000 yuan but could not get any. According to the owner of the tree, Mr. Liu, 5,000 yuan per lychee is not expensive. Before the war, one lychee could be exchanged for 100 jin of grain. Now 100 jin of grain is worth tens of thousands of yuan. Compared to that, the price is much cheaper.</p>
<p>Guangdong province has a bumper harvest of ordinary lychees, with smooth arrivals from various places. The price is 150 to 200 yuan per jin, but there are no buyers, mainly due to severe grain shortages and the prevalence of epidemics. Lychees are easily infected, so there are few buyers. Comparing this situation with the aforementioned "Gualu" lychees reveals a vast difference.</p>

<p>— Yang Yanbing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th Dispatch</p>
<p>On the clear morning of June 12th, the weather was unusually gloomy. At the entrance of 357 Zhongshan East Road, plain white horses were prepared. Relatives and officials came in succession to the public memorial for the late Director Dai Yu-nong.</p>
<p>In the center of the memorial hall was the late Director Dai's portrait, with President Chiang's inscription of "Crimson Blood for Eternity" above it. The National Government's commendation order was posted next to the spirit, and elegiac couplets and wreaths decorated the interior and exterior of the memorial hall.</p>
<h3 id="e144">President Chiang <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Mourns the Heroic Spirit</p>
<p>At around nine o'clock, President Chiang, wearing a grass-green military uniform, accompanied by Song Ziwen, Bai Chongxi, He Yaozu, Liu Jianqun, and others, walked into the memorial hall amidst mournful music. After offering incense and wreaths, he proceeded to read the eulogy, which read:</p>
<p>"On this, the twelfth day of June in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Chung-cheng, Chairman of the National Government, respectfully offers wine and flowers to the spirit of the late Director Dai Yu-nong, saying: Alas, the sound of drums and trumpets frequently resounds, and the scourge of war continues. Every man has a duty to sweep away the stench of evil. Who would have expected that one morning, this hero would fall? My heart is wounded by this loss, and my inner organs are in torment. Remembering back to Whampoa, you received instruction, gifted with talent and possessing unique insight. Your ambition surpassed the ordinary, and your steps were as swift as a thoroughbred horse. You faced danger and walked on thin ice, never looking back. During the Northern Expedition, you served as a vanguard, venturing into the enemy's den, skillfully deploying military strategies. You quelled the chaos in Jiangbiao, offering insightful advice. You analyzed doubts and presented strategies, diligently participating. You maintained discipline and diligently oversaw the heavy workload of transportation. You meticulously uncovered the hidden, leaving no stone unturned. You patiently sharpened your abilities like twisting a cow's horn. You secretly planned brilliant schemes, securing our borders. Your victorious calculations reached far and wide, pacifying the distant regions. The enemy's petty schemes vanished without a trace. Reflecting on your accomplishments, your contributions are truly great. Against the Japanese invaders, everyone feared your strategic prowess. Your plans to assess the enemy and eliminate traitors were perfectly executed. You investigated corruption in government and the embezzlement of public funds, leaving no wrongdoing unexamined. You revived decaying customs and upheld the law of the land. You were relied upon as a vital support, managing the central government. You upheld justice and integrity, and the people praised your arrival. You worked even harder to defend against incursions, employing unique tactics that shattered enemy forces and brought credit to our army. Friendly nations admired your exceptional skills, and you were hailed as a model of excellence. Your outstanding achievements surpassed those of your peers. Your integrity shone brightly, and your conduct was always honorable. Numerous awards were bestowed upon you, yet you always remained humble. Your virtues and high character are admired by the world. You diligently contemplated your duties and hoped to mend the heavens. With light words of triumph, I painfully visited every corner. Suppressing traitors and capturing rebels was your paramount duty. Your sudden departure has left a void in my heart. Your solitary light shines brightly among the stars. Remembering the hardships of the times, I deeply mourn the loss to our party. Your death is irreplaceable. Your loyalty and bravery are an example for us, and your contributions should be recorded in history. Praising your achievements and honoring your virtues, the people will never forget you. Pure wine is offered here; come and partake." At this point, the atmosphere became even more somber. President Chiang silently bowed his head in contemplation, then exited the memorial hall amidst mournful music.</p>

<p>— Successively Pay Tribute</p>
<p>After President Chiang led the public memorial, Wu Jingheng, Dai Chuanxian, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Zhourue, Liu Wendao, Xu Kan, Gu Weijun, Xue Yue, Zheng Jiemin, and hundreds of others followed. Colonel Berry, representing Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Seventh Fleet, came to pay his respects, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Hagy, Lieutenant Colonel Es, and Major Ace. Colonel Berry was the Chief of Staff of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO). He had spent time with Dai day and night. In February of this year, he went to Suzhou with Dai to reorganize the Loyal Salvation Army. In the three years they spent together, he felt that Dai was the most approachable, kind-hearted, pragmatic, sincerely supportive of the central government, quick to act, and never gave up until he achieved his goals. Therefore, Dai's death at a time when the war of resistance and nation-building was full of complex tasks was not only a loss for China but also for SACO, which lost a good friend.</p>
<p>Colonel Berry's Chinese and English signature for this newspaper:</p>
<p>Berry talking about General Dai</p>
<p>In total, over three thousand people participated. During the period of cooperation with China, SACO had the following achievements: killing 26,799 enemies, wounding 11,642, capturing 508, destroying 183 bridges, 158 sampans, 35 steamships, 1 aircraft, 425 train cars, 271 warehouses, railways, and rescuing 130 Allied pilots. SACO focused on meteorological and meteorological-related communication intelligence, organizing a meteorological network that included the Pacific region, providing intelligence to Allied fleets and land and air forces. Weather stations were set up in various locations, reporting enemy movements day and night, and detecting enemy ship movements to facilitate their destruction. When the reporter asked if Dai had any hobbies, Colonel Berry shook his head and smiled: "He didn't gamble, he absolutely didn't smoke, but at parties, he liked to drink. His maximum alcohol capacity was 160 cups of yellow wine at once, but he never got completely drunk. Slightly tipsy, he liked to give long, interesting speeches, without losing his dignity."</p>
<p>To commemorate a great Chinese man, a friend of the United States, and to commemorate the achievements of SACO, the US has decided to award a medal, which will soon be sent to China and given to General Dai's son. The US side of SACO will end its operations at the end of June, and from July onwards, the Chinese side will be responsible for continuing meteorological and communication intelligence work. Finally, Colonel Berry sighed and said: "China is losing General Dai at this time, which is indeed very sad."</p>
<p>The Old Lady Calls Out to Her Son in Dreams</p>
<p>Dai's younger brother, Mr. Yunlin Cangyi, arrived in Nanjing two days ago. Today, when Mr. Yunlin was asked by the reporter if the old lady knew about Dai's death, tears welled up in his eyes. From his elegiac couplet, one could know his sorrowful feelings: "His soul returns to Xianxia Ridge, surely knowing his old mother leans and waits; her eyes will wear through, his body remains in the Stone City, so that later generations can pay their respects, tears ready to fall."</p>
<p>Dai would always take the opportunity to go home and see his old mother once a year. This year, on the 27th day of the fourth lunar month, which was Dai's 50th birthday, his mother waited all day for her son to return, but now there will be no day of reunion. Yunlin Guang-sheng said: "To reduce my burden and to hope that my old mother would not have an accident, I have been hiding the truth from her until now. When she brought it up, I said: 'Chairman Chiang sent him abroad.' She asked again: 'When will he be back? Why hasn't there been any news?'" Mr. Yunlin finally said: "Pitiful white-haired old mother, still calling out in her sleep in the middle of the night: 'When will you come back?'"</p>
<p>The heavens suddenly began to rain, but the representatives of the people continued to come to the public memorial. This scene added to the grief and remembrance of countless comrades!</p>
<h3 id="e146">Nationwide Railroad Strike in the US: A Tense Scene – Truman's First Test of Iron-Fisted Policy <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the US: Zhu Jiarang</p>
<p>New York Airmail Dispatch, 26th of this Month</p>
<p>The economic "civil war" in the United States is becoming increasingly fierce. On one side, there's the debate over price controls versus no controls, with ordinary citizens and large corporations locked in a fierce battle. On the other side, the conflict between labor and employers continues unabated. This battle spans the entire nation, involves various sectors, and the situation worsens daily. Industrial production relies on interconnected dependencies. If one wave subsides only for another to rise, how can the great cause of economic recovery be achieved? Moreover, things are deteriorating, to the point that even the lifeblood of this giant went on strike last week! Trains were completely halted, and stations had to close their iron gates. Isn't this absurd, and what kind of situation is this? Yet, the reality was truly this shocking!</p>
<p>Although the storm has now subsided, looking back at the two days of the strike, it instantly paralyzed the entire living national economic system, disintegrated its original functions, put the government to a great test, and caused a great panic in society. Fortunately, the authorities used their skills, the public offered united support, and national interests prevailed over class interests. As a result, two stubborn union leaders in their seventies finally bowed their heads and admitted, "President, we are patriots" (quoted from a letter to the President). The trains then started running again.</p>
<p>Speaking of democratic policies and maintaining stability, this nationwide railroad strike in the US can be said to have reached the highest peak of escalating labor disputes. However, observing its evolution, it may open a new chapter for future labor-management disputes. That is to say, things always have a saturation point. The American machine has been dragging its feet since VE and VJ Day, making a mockery of the word "production." If things cannot be produced and business cannot be done, how can things continue? Although the country emphasizes democracy, policies must be stable. Therefore, calls for labor legislation, reforms, and restrictions on labor unrest are rising, this being one reason. Secondly, the government will resolutely prevent major industries and transportation from experiencing further disruptions that would affect the shutdown of other industries. In general, if disputes occur and become unmanageable, the government will inevitably use the means of receivership to deter strikes because, at this point, striking would be tantamount to resisting the government. The government would then impose legislative sanctions. The failure of this railroad strike was due to not only withstanding the anger of the public but also withstanding the charge of "resisting the government." The impact will naturally have a positive effect on the future trends of labor unrest.</p>
<p>The evolution of this railroad strike itself is quite tortuous and bizarre, and it can be seen as a comedy. In terms of the process of the strike, the brewing was certainly not overnight. As early as July of last year, the 20 railway unions nationwide had already proposed a wage increase of $2.50 per day. At the same time, they also wanted to amend 45 work rules to increase income. In accordance with the first step of the Railway Labor Act, the authorities had them negotiate directly, but it failed; the second step was mediation, but it failed; the third step, in January of this year, was arbitration, but it also failed. Thus, the fourth step was for the President to appoint a fact-finding commission to investigate the actual situation and propose a plan. The result of the proposal was that wages should be increased by $1.28 per day (that is, 16 cents per hour), and work rules should be discussed separately. However, this plan was not accepted by the union, and negotiations broke down, so the union set a date for a strike.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Nationwide Strike – The Entire Country is Shaken <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The government is certainly facing a headache in dealing with recent labor unrest, especially President Truman, who bears a great burden. Although he has the Secretary of Labor and expert advisors to handle things together, the matter is still thorny. In particular, the two union leaders were strong-willed, making mediation very difficult. When the first strike date was approaching, they finally conceded a bit and extended the deadline by five days. However, during these five days, the progress was even slower than a "snail's pace." The President finally issued a receivership order and proposed a precedent of increasing wages by 18.5 cents per hour, while postponing the amendment of regulations for a year. Unfortunately, while the other 18 unions accepted, the leaders of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers still refused to listen and bluntly and disrespectfully replied to the President, "We have repeatedly told you that the workers are now very angry. Their demands cannot be refused…Therefore, your proposal cannot be accepted." The trains across the country were thus halted, starting at 4:00 PM on May 23rd.</p>
<p>The 348 main lines of the US railways, totaling 228,000 miles, encountered an unprecedented "rest," and the nation's economic life immediately faced a deep and serious threat. All factories that were previously obstinate simply closed down altogether. The food and fuel for the cities, which normally relied entirely on trains, were cut off. There were also dozens of cars of relief supplies that were about to be transported overseas to save lives, but they were unable to move, causing great anxiety. In addition, travelers were stranded, and commerce was frozen. (According to statistics, the national train passenger volume is 450 million per year, averaging three trips per person per year. In our country, it would be exactly one trip per person per year). This storm truly struck the hearts of everyone, shaking the entire country, and the impact was of course significant.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Various Departments Respond Calmly and Effectively <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Here, we have two noteworthy things that should be mentioned first. We will begin with the government authorities. Leaving aside the measures taken by the presidential palace, the preparations of the relevant departments in charge and their calm and effective response in the face of emergencies are admirable. From the start of the strike, the government's Department of Defense Transportation was continuously announcing contingency plans on the radio. All transportation adopted a priority system, determining what should be transported first and what should be stopped. All available air and water transportation tools were concentrated and kept on standby. The post office's emergency measures were to use air transportation for all letters while limiting the delivery of packages, setting limits on weight and size. Furthermore, local governments also separately informed the public, advising them to remain calm and stating that the city's food and fuel supply would not be exhausted in the short term. They also opened certain bridges and tunnels, and they mobilized long-distance buses to allow residents in suburban areas to use them as transportation, etc. This shows that their actions were not panicked, and everything was prepared. Secondly, in terms of the public, they were naturally worried, but their attitude was mostly calm. They were dissatisfied with the union's actions, but their analysis of the situation was relatively clear. They wanted to talk to their representatives and write letters to the newspapers. Many people felt that President Truman's response was somewhat weak. The number of letters and telegrams sent to the White House demanding action was said to be unprecedented since he took office. Thirdly, speaking of the workers themselves, the strike was originally voted on by themselves, so they naturally acted in unison. However, such actions only caused suffering to the masses, which was not their original intention. Therefore, some of the more senior workers put on civilian clothes and voluntarily drove back and forth to the suburbs several times to pick up and drop off working men and women. Although the number of trips was small, it showed their unique style. As for the train stations being deserted after the strike, it was inevitable. The workers did not form pickets because the railway had been taken over and temporarily belonged to the government, so if workers were to picket, they would be arrested according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Angry Roars in the White House <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The above is a paragraph. Next, we should talk about President Truman's first test of iron-fisted policy. On the second night of the strike, just as Congress was hotly debating a bill to stop the strike, radio commentators were vociferously criticizing the labor unrest on the air, and the President suddenly uttered angry roars in the White House office. From the recent movies, we can see President Truman's stern and tired expression. From the radio that evening, we could feel that the President's tone was low and slightly hoarse, and we can imagine how worried and overworked he was. However, that evening's speech was clear, powerful, sincere, and moving. At the same time, it combined kindness and severity, and it finally won the support of the public and the return of the striking workers.</p>
<p>The gist of President Truman's speech that day was to report on the handling of the situation, clarify where the responsibility lay, and explain the pros and cons of the matter, while ordering the workers to return to work. First, he explained that the nature of the strike was purely an act of rebellion against the US government. Second, he explained that the government could not expose its weakness and should actively respond. Third, he explained that the strike affected the lives and health of people at home and abroad, and the responsibility rested entirely with the two union leaders. Finally, he issued a 24-hour ultimatum, ordering everyone to return to work by 4:00 PM the following afternoon. Otherwise, he would send troops to operate the trains in order to maintain transportation. The President admitted to being a friend of the workers. In his previous role as a Senator, he had always spoken for the workers. However, this reckless act could not be tolerated. He especially severely criticized the two union leaders without any leniency. He compared this incident to the Pearl Harbor incident, except that the attack came from the domestic selfish interests of a few individuals. President's rare anger truly represented the common feelings of the majority of the people, and things took a sudden and dramatic turn. The next morning, representatives of the other 18 unions, representing 120,000 workers, were the first to sign the agreement, accepting the President's terms of 18.5 cents per hour. The two union leaders also immediately sent a letter to the President, expressing their willingness to negotiate again. However, the President ignored them. He was preparing to convene a joint session of Congress in the afternoon to deliver a speech, demanding emergency legislation. The unions had no choice but to admit defeat, fully sign the agreement according to the President's terms, and immediately agree to return to work. At this time, President Truman happened to be delivering a passionate speech in Congress, and the crisis suddenly passed, ending the comedy here.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Emergency Law – National Interest Comes First <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>However, although the railway workers have returned to work, the coal mine labor unrest is still at a stalemate. The President's emergency legislation requests the power to crack down on acts of striking and resisting the government after the government has taken over, while also having the power to send workers into the military. At the same time, he hopes that Congress will formulate a fundamental plan to strengthen labor policies and protect people's lives. The applause from Congress also came from Republicans, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene, demonstrating that the general trend of the country has matured and become clear. This time may tell you that the long-standing labor unrest should come to an end. Furthermore, due to this railway unrest, we can also know that although the people's freedom must not be violated and the principles of democracy cannot be shaken, the nation still comes first, and the interests of the working masses are not the top priority. The interests of the entire public are the top priority!</p>

<p>There are three busiest people on the fringe of the White House: Ross is one of them. It is never an easy task to properly deal with several hundred reporters, large and small. The second busiest is the President's advisor, Steelman. He is the person designated by the President to confer with representatives of both labor and management. I know that several times, the opinions of railway employees were forwarded to the President by Steelman. The third busiest person, of course, is the President himself.</p>

<p>There are two central figures in the strike movement. They are also the targets of newspaper reporters. One is the leader of the train drivers' union, Johnston, who is tall with a long, thin face. The other is the leader of the railway workers, Whitney, a stout middle-aged man. These two "dictators" of the democratic country are now the most authoritative figures in the United States. Their words and orders control the transportation of tens of millions of Americans back and forth, as well as the prices affected by transportation.</p>
<p>However, Johnston himself told me that he is just a "transmitter" for 250,000 railway workers. He has no power to quell the labor unrest, nor does he have the power to promote it out of thin air. He said that there are many workers in the United States, and economic problems and economic disputes are also becoming more complex. "Compared to China, it is, of course, very different." I looked at his long, thin shadow, slightly trembling in the White House garden.</p>
<p>The order for the government to take over the nation's railways was issued by President Truman the day before he left the White House. An American colleague told me that everyone had high expectations for the government's takeover. In fact, the so-called "takeover" was originally temporary. The capitalists (the owners of the railway companies) said, "I cannot agree to the labor's terms. If I agree, I will lose money." The workers said, "If these conditions are not met, I cannot live." Therefore, according to constitutional practice, in this dilemma, there is a method for the government to temporarily take over. Since the government has taken over, the person in charge must also plan. The government is not a person with excess capital, so where does it get the money to lose for no reason? If it cannot lose money for no reason, there are more problems. On the day President Truman returned to the White House, his first major decision was to raise the salaries of railway employees. The railway companies had originally agreed to a wage increase of $1.28 per day, but the President decided to increase it by another 20 cents, changing it to $1.48 per day. However, the workers did not react because the crux of the problem was not the wage increase, but the improvement of service methods.</p>
<p>The railway workers and engine workers are very determined about these 45 points of method. From the beginning of the talks on President Washington's Monday to the outbreak of the strike, the talks yielded no results.</p>
<h3 id="e153">"Isolated Island" New York <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>I returned to New York the day before the railway strike began (the 22nd). Before leaving, observations from all sides suggested that there would be no results. I feared that if the strike were to begin, I would not be able to reach New York and would be stuck in Washington, which would also be boring. After arriving in New York, I learned that the buses had already</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 23rd, Pennsylvania Station on 34th Street in New York was truly an incredible sight. The iron gates of the station hall suddenly closed. Police with weapons were around. Outside the iron gates, there was a sea of people. Some were watching the excitement with nothing to do, while others were helping the old and young, carrying suitcases and luggage, unaware of the strike and intending to take the train. When they arrived at the station, they learned that the train had an accident. Dozens of locomotives and carriages lay quietly on the platform. The railway workers and workers had already slipped away.</p>
<p>The radio continuously broadcast news of the general strike, and newspapers sold extra editions. The citizens of New York watched the development of the event with a sense of half-surprise and half-curiosity. In New York, the most popular word now is "isolated island." "New York has become an isolated island," Governor Dewey broadcast to the people of New York, with this as the opening line.</p>
<p>Of course, the most serious problem for an isolated island is "food." The food for New York City, no, the food for the entire state of New York, is supplied by the Midwest. Meat is also the same. With the trains cut off, there are more problems. Governor Dewey and Mayor O'Dwyer believe that the only remedy is to mobilize all cars and planes to save this crisis.</p>
<p>There is a precedent for this. In 1922, there was a general strike on the national railways. But it did not occur after the government took over. The government took over the railways during World War I and returned them to the company immediately after the Versailles Conference was convened.</p>
<p>It is probably the first time that the government announced a takeover, and the result was still a strike. On the tram, an old lady angrily told me, "President Truman has no ability and has brought the United States to this point!" The tram turned from 96th Street to the Hudson River shore. As I looked at the turbulent waters of the Hudson River, I thought of President Truman's peaceful pace in the White House garden, of his anxiety lurking in his heart as he looked at the chaotic national affairs, and I felt that it was not easy to sing half an encore!</p>

<h3 id="e155">Screening Method for Middle School Graduates During the Enemy Puppet Period <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued a registration form for screening middle school graduates from the enemy puppet period. The method for screening general middle school graduates from the enemy puppet period is very detailed, and it also requires writing a "Report on Reading the Three Principles of the People." We absolutely agree with this principle, but the method seems inappropriate. (1) Simply filling out this form as the screening standard may lead to people filling it out randomly and recklessly, and the authorities may not be able to discern the truth. At the same time, the submitted documents cannot be used as ironclad evidence. As everyone knows, everything was shrouded in secrecy during the enemy puppet period, and how could the education sector be an exception? Spending a little money, inviting a guest, and obtaining a graduation diploma was easy. Therefore, how can the documents submitted by students during registration be used as the standard for screening? (2) Regarding writing a "Report on Reading the Three Principles of the People," we think that students will naturally hope to pass the registration, so they will seek help from others to write the essay or even have it written for them, and even ask others to transcribe it. It is simply completely false, and how can the authorities discern the truth? (3) The review board treats normal school graduates from the enemy puppet period in the same way as the former. We believe that the academic qualifications of normal school students are certainly important, but experience is even more important. Experienced teachers with less academic qualifications may not necessarily be half as effective in their education. Today, the lives of public school teachers are difficult, as everyone knows. The enthusiastic service of normal school graduates from the enemy puppet period who are now teaching is worthy of admiration. Why are the authorities so harsh? The best screening method, in my opinion, is to have a collective screening examination and use the results of this examination as the standard, which would surely be more accurate. At the same time, I believe that those who fail the screening (whether normal school students or other middle school students) should be given training. Our country is in the initial stages of reconstruction, and various departments are lacking talent to work. Can the authorities bear to let go of this general group of young people? Reader Yuan Xiao, June 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Methods of the French Water and Electricity Company <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company has always been highly skilled in collecting water and electricity bills from users. Before the return of the concessions, the prices of French water and electricity were always higher than those of British companies, Zhabei, and Chinese companies. Since the issuance of Reserve Coupons to collect legal tender at a rate of two to one, the company has used the excuse of increasing a deposit from users. Starting in September of the previous year, it also cleverly set up a so-called "meter maintenance fee" for users. The amount depended on the size of the meter, with a minimum of 25 yuan per month for each water meter and electricity meter. Later, it was repeatedly increased to 40 yuan, 80 yuan, and by the time of the Japanese surrender, it had risen to a minimum of 250 yuan per month for each meter. Even after legal tender was used, the French company maintained the name of the meter maintenance fee. Starting in January of this year, the Public Utilities Bureau discovered it and ordered the cancellation of this cleverly established meter maintenance fee, which was of course a good policy for users. However, the French company was unwilling to give up, so they used their clever methods again, adding a column called "Supplementing the Minimum Number" to the monthly water bill, meaning that an extra fee had to be charged in addition to the regular bill. The user never knew what the minimum number was, but no matter how much you used, you would have to add a few degrees of expense for nothing. Starting in April of this year, the French water price has increased from 50 yuan to 120 yuan per degree, but supplementing the minimum number is still being charged. I hope that the Public Utilities Bureau authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable behavior of the company. I suspect that the French company may exempt the users who are employees of the Public Utilities Bureau from this additional fee. Otherwise, how could they not know about it and fail to correct it?

<h3 id="e159">Tokyo, Autumn 1945 <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A friend brought back a book from Tokyo—"Tokyo, Autumn 1945," published by the Japan Culture Society. It is beautifully printed, with a striking crimson cover!</p>
<p>I finished reading all the pictures and discerned two themes hidden within them: "The Might of the Occupation Army" and "The Poverty of Tokyo." What these two themes tell the Japanese people about their own country is self-evident.</p>
<p>For example, there are images like "Occupation Army Road Signs at Yotsuya Mitsuke (place name)" and "A Line of Jeeps in Front of the Marunouchi Meiji Insurance Company"; and others like "The Remains of Ningyocho Seen from Kiyosu Bridge," "A Queue at a Tram Stop," "Street Vendor Scenes," "Homeless People Under the Saigo Takamori Statue," "Homeless People Within the Grounds of Asakusa Hongan-ji Temple," and "A Father and Daughter Near a Pond"...</p>
<p>It has been nearly nine years since I left Tokyo on August 10, 1945. This city once held my youthful dreams, and now, seeing the face of post-war Tokyo before me, I cannot help but feel nostalgic. Surugadai, Ichigaya, Yurakucho, Ginza; fishing used to be possible on Sukiyabashi Bridge, and rickshaws lined up in front of the Japan Theater. A foreigner could not imagine it.</p>
<p>The two predecessors who best understood Japan—Jiang Baili and Wang Jingwei—have unfortunately passed away one after the other. If they were still alive, they would tell us how the Japanese are preparing to weather the next five years, and what Japan will be like in those five years.</p>
<p>All of Japan has only one slogan now: "Reconstruction." The only slogan is "Reconstruction." Although the two old gentlemen, Jiang and Wang, have passed on, this picture book has answered the two questions above for me.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a legend of a mouse that steals oil and turns into a bat. Although this legend is unscientific, it is deeply meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Mice <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Renhou</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of "crick, crick, crick" of mice in the room.</p>
<p>This sound is very annoying, making it impossible to fall back asleep. First, I'm afraid it will gnaw on my only remaining broken box; second, I'm afraid it will chew through the leather shoes under the bed. And then there's a bar of laundry soap that I haven't put back in the box, and I'm afraid it will drag it away again.</p>
<p>Gradually, anger builds up in my body, and I leap out of bed in a "tiger jump." But by the time I put on my shoes and light the lamp, the mice have already run off. It's like scaring a snake too early. At this point, there's nothing one can do about a mouse. What can I do? I can only adopt a defensive posture, putting everything that might be invaded by the mice in a safer place. But by the time I blow out the lamp again and return to bed, I'm wide awake.</p>
<p>So, I inevitably developed a hatred for mice. During the day, I often see mice sneaking out of the sewers, with their timid eyes and pointed noses. They sniff around and crawl towards a stray grain of rice. I suddenly shout loudly, scaring it back into its hole, which is my way of getting revenge like Ah Q.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a legend of a mouse that steals oil and turns into a bat. Although this legend is unscientific, it is deeply meaningful. It reflects a social phenomenon: if you steal "oil," you'll find a way. For the mouse, it can become a bat and fly up to the sky. For people, those who steal oil and grease their palms are all well-fed and on top of the social ladder. I remember a minor clerk in the county government who hadn't even graduated from middle school. Somehow, he got into the county government, pocketed "interest" for a few years, and squeezed the people dry. After stealing oil and greasing his palms, he became rich, well-groomed, and dressed in a suit every day, showing off his importance, thinking he was a first-class person in society. He was a prime example of a mouse stealing oil and rising in the world.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a science report about the lifespan of mice, which is said to be a maximum of three years. It seems that every ten days a mouse lives is equivalent to a year for a human. So, living three years is equivalent to humans living eighty or ninety years, which is quite a long life. When we see a mangy, rotten-tailed mouse crawling out of its hole, we can't help but feel a little pity for it because it is really old.</p>
<p>Mice are afraid of cats. Generally, domestic cats can be divided into three types: The first type has the appearance of a cat but none of its abilities. Mice are naturally afraid of it, but in reality, it can only scare them. It can do nothing else. This is perhaps a bit like a school headmaster who is full of authority, forcing students to shave their heads, wishing he could shave the hair off their scalps as well, and forbidding them from wearing hats in the hot sun to show off his success in moral education.</p>
<p>The second type of cat has neither authority nor ability, but it has a flattering manner, always crouching at its owner's feet, eating and doing nothing. It neither catches mice nor recognizes what a mouse is. Of course, mice are not afraid of it. It doesn't meddle in other people's affairs and is carefree, a beloved pet.</p>
<p>The last type of cat can be said to be a true cat. It has both authority and ability. When mice encounter it, they are so scared that their bones soften, and they willingly wait for it to swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Once, I saw a hungry cat tied to a doorway. Somehow, it caught a mouse. I watched it eat the mouse bit by bit. It first ate the head, and the internal organs flowed out. Then, it ate the internal organs, and then the body. Finally, only the tail was left. I thought it wouldn't eat it, but after looking at it again and again, it seemed to think that leaving it there was inappropriate, so it ate the tail as well. I admired it greatly. Such a hero is truly the pride of our animal world!</p>
<p>Mice and cats are "mortal enemies," but mice never think of revenge. To deal with cats, they only have two options: "escape" or "non-resistance," "willing submission," and "being at the mercy of others."</p>
<p>However, those who study zoology know very well that there is rarely peace between mice. When they see their own kind, they point their noses at each other, bare their teeth, glare, and fight. They even devour each other's corpses. I once did an experiment. After catching a mouse, I fed it a poison called potassium cyanide and then released it back into its nest.</p>
<p>A few days later, the mice disappeared. When I dug up the floor, I found five or six mouse corpses. It turned out that they had greedily eaten the flesh of their own kind and were poisoned as a result.</p>
<p>However, although mice are timid, kill each other, and commit all sorts of acts that lead to the extinction of their species, they are fortunate to have a particularly high reproductive rate, which is rare among mammals. They can reproduce four times a year, with four to six offspring each time. Imagine, two mice can produce sixteen to twenty-four more in a year. No wonder there are so many of them. Who among us can rest easy?</p>

<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Macau is an outlet to the sea for Zhongshan, in fact, it is a port to Hong Kong. It does not occupy much land, and after several hundred years of operation by the Portuguese, it only has the scale of a modern city. After the "July 7th Incident," the Chinese strengthened some buildings there, making it look a bit more presentable. This can only be compared to Shiqi in Zhongshan. Compared to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, it is far behind. I rarely go out, so I am naturally very unfamiliar with my birthplace of Zhongshan, and I also have no impression of Macau, which I have passed through. However, my cousin has a particular fondness for it and returned there from the island of Hawaii in the Pacific to live there for a long time. However, his family was ruined there because of his fondness for it, because it is known as the Monte Carlo of the Orient.</p>
<p>In the autumn of eight years ago, I stayed in Macau for two days and two whole nights. On the first night, a servant at the hotel specially came into my room to introduce me to "Cha Cha Tan." I asked blankly what it was all about. From his explanation, I learned that he was introducing me to enjoy a woman who had just had her "rights of the first night" enjoyed by someone else. I found this euphemism very novel, but I was in a state of confusion, and my pocketbook could only afford me two meals at a "Da Dian," so I really couldn't accept his kindness, which caused me to suffer the servant's glare at the time. On the second night, I became a pimp who didn't spend any money. A friend of my brother invited me to play a few rounds of mahjong at a brothel in Xin Jie. I watched as they drew a lot of big money. When the feast was opened, I tasted Western white wine for the first time. After the feast was over, while they were putting out the candles and keeping their hair, I saw the wonders of the short doors inside two rows on the street, which were clearly very different and unusual from those in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin. Later, I went there twice, both short stays, and unfortunately, I didn't have the good fortune to "hang on the upper floor." I only walked from the park to Wansong Mountain on a rainy evening, and then from Wansong Mountain to the South Ring, enjoying some of the seaside scenery in the rain.</p>
<p>In my intuition, Macau is a place that hides dirt and accepts filth. It is not a big place, but there are many smelly roads. When I was young in the countryside, I saw many villagers go to Macau. After only a few days, they would take a mountain sedan back to the countryside. It is said that they brought back a lot of fruit. Greedy, I followed a villager once, but I didn't want to get any fruit, but I got slapped in the face and felt dizzy. After that, I dared not ask anyone for it. However, my little heart had already conceived that Macau was a place where fruit grew on people.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I read Wu Mojing's postscript, in which he had the following notes on Macau:</p>
<p>"Macau is also called Haojing. Not far from Macau, there are the customs of Greater and Lesser West. Its etiquette and customs are contrary to our village; for example, when people from our village meet guests, they must dress neatly, but here they only take off their hats when they meet people. The same is true of books and writings. Our characters are formed by dots and strokes, and then there is sound. They have strokes first, and then characters, which are formed by hooks, strokes, rows, and horizontal views. Our paintings do not take likeness, nor do they fall into clichés, which is called Shenyi. They use hard work in yin and yang, back and forth, likeness, and clichés. That is the inscription. Ours is written at the top, and theirs at the bottom. The use of brushes is also different, and it is often like this, which cannot be fully described.</p>
<p>"Li Yishan often sighed that he hated that he could not fulfill his life in Kyushu, and wrote a poem: 'I have only heard of nine more states overseas. I cannot predict the next life in this life.' As I was about to arrive, the boatmen pointed their fingers, and then I knew that the ninth point of Aogingluo in Li's poem was only a short distance away. The front waves flew over and could not rush people. Looking at it from the boat, the sea atmosphere was slightly misty, or it appeared suddenly, like a floating gull.</p>
<p>"Hao has no fields, only stone sand, and the soil is very barren. The residents do not know about spring plowing, and many are merchants; they do not plant mulberry trees, and women do not know about silkworm farming. They cover their whole bodies with red and purple brocade, slightly revealing half of their eyebrows and eyes; those in mourning wear black. The men have curly hair over their shoulders and wear hats like bamboo hats, which they remove when they see people; they wear short wool coats with very narrow sleeves. The middle of the clothes has buttons all around, and they wear leather clogs with only one tooth. Two swords, one long and one short, are worn horizontally at the waist, and those who hold rattan branches are officials."</p>
<p>Wu Mojing was one of the six great painters in the early Qing Dynasty. He studied with Wang Hui and Shigu. Later, he fled to Macau to avoid Wang Hui's persecution and spent the rest of his life there. According to the three excerpts above, his impression of Macau shows how much interest was aroused by the surprises of different customs at the time. But now, in our view, there is nothing strange about it. As for my view of Macau, it is that such a dirty and unlikeable city still owns a lot of Chinese investment.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A Record of Yang Liaogong of Yun Jian <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Liaogong, a famous scholar from Jian, was unrestrained and refined, transcending worldly affairs. He was also generous and concerned about public affairs, which is rare in modern times. In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), at the age of sixty-three, Mr. Yang accepted the invitation of the Chairman of Jiangsu Province to govern a county in Pudong, Shanghai. From the moment he took office, he advocated local autonomy, and all personnel and administrative decisions were based on public opinion. He first created a public newspaper, opened up public discourse, built land and water transportation, used public labor without exhausting public finances, and resolved disputes, bringing peace to the whole county. Mr. Yang was fond of personally visiting the people to understand their hardships. Sometimes he would enter teahouses to talk with the people. No matter how big or small the matter, he would learn the truth, and then write proclamations to post in public places, explaining things himself, which amazed the people. He banned smoking and gambling, starting with the gentry, not the common people. His personal example transformed the customs of the people. He did not seek personal gain during his three months in office.</p>
<p>At that time, I was teaching in Shanghai. During the winter vacation, I returned to my province and paid my respects to Mr. Yang at the Minglun Hall of the county government as a student. Upon entering his room, I saw Mr. Yang writing a poem: "This year's New Year's Eve debts are especially high, but I haven't made a sound. What can I do? After managing and sending away the god of poverty, I will have a comfortable home next year." He put down his pen, looked at me, and smiled, and asked if I had money to buy a pound of honey dates to treat guests. It turned out that Mr. Yang liked sweets. I happened to have brought new Huizhou tribute dates. Then he handed me a piece of paper and said, "Go back and read it with your father. Don't look at it first." When I looked at it with my father, it said, "Please resign your position, and I will do the same." Mr. Yang resigned on the day of the Lunar New Year after three months in office. The county government staff had a tradition of paying New Year's greetings. In the midst of the excitement, Mr. Yang quietly left.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang began to call himself Liaogong in middle age, meaning "I am done with public affairs." Mr. Yang came from a prominent family in Yun Jian and owned dozens of hectares of land. Because of his "Liaogong" intentions, he sold them all. I remember that in a certain year, there was a flood in seven provinces. Zhu Ziqiao wrote to Mr. Yang, saying that he urgently needed funds. So, he pawned a hundred hectares of land to help him. Mr. Yang did good deeds throughout his life. The result was the Songjiang Orphanage, which he founded. Today, some of the orphans in the orphanage have graduated from university. In his later years, he lived in the Zhu residence on Ximen Road, Sanqing Lane, Shanghai, selling books for a living and enjoying himself. He wrote a self-eulogy: "Family tyrant, social public figure," which suggests that a clean official cannot be both.</p>

<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>President Truman revealed some news about Stalin's health in early June. Mr. Stalin's health is poor, so he cannot visit the United States. He is not suitable for air travel. Getting on a plane causes him to have ringing in his ears and his heart is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The US President has twice invited Stalin to visit the US for a "social visit." The first invitation was in July last year, when the Berlin Conference was coming to an end. The first time was at the Foreign Ministers' Conference last month, when Byrnes told Molotov. Both times, Stalin declined due to ill health.</p>
<p>President Truman is preparing to donate his collection of small war trophies to the West Point Military Academy Museum. At the same time, he enjoys showing his collection of small trinkets to his visitors, especially a Japanese katana sword, with two daggers on the scabbard, which are relics from the 17th century.</p>
<p>The housing shortage in the UK is also very serious. The general public is quite dissatisfied with the government's speed in building houses. Although the government has decided to build 500,000 houses every year, which is much more than the 360,000 before the war, it will still take five years to complete the 2.5 million houses needed.</p>
<p>According to the experience of travelers in Rome, the black market meal prices have decreased by 50% in the past two months. One reason is the increase in overseas food imports, and the second is that domestic vegetable gardens have products on the market. Currently, a sumptuous meal costs about four US dollars.</p>
<p>The competition among American filmmakers for the filming rights to "The Roosevelt Story" was extremely fierce, but recently all parties seem to have stopped fighting and temporarily given up because they cannot find a suitable actor to play Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Three thousand American soldiers were transferred to Berlin at the beginning of this month, and the black market price of cigarettes plummeted from 1,600 marks (equivalent to 160 US dollars) per carton to 1,200 marks because American G.I.s released a large number of cigarettes.</p>
<p>On the shore of Lake Zurich in Switzerland, there is a school that is sometimes called a "Humanity School." It is an oasis in the desert-like European education world. There are forty students here, learning the courses of reason and tolerance. The principal of the school is a 75-year-old German educator.

<p>Cholera is prevalent, and the death rate has been increasing in recent days. Even without the threat of this "tiger," environmental hygiene is especially important in the summer. Here, we need to overcome the selfish notion of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door." We would like to put forward the slogan "Help yourself, help others."</p>
<p>Here are four photographs. The two above are of events that happened in Shanghai: the City God Temple, where sewage has accumulated for eight years, causing a foul odor in the summer. The people in the neighborhood specially negotiated with the Nanshi and Beiqu Fire Brigade to work day and night to pump out the water, and now the entire Release Pond has been cleared. (Photographed by Shuo, our newspaper)</p>
<p>The two below are of events that happened abroad: "Vienna Youth Helping to Clean Streets" and "Residents of Holland, Michigan, USA, Cleaning Streets." (Special supply from the New York Times)</p>
<p>After you have seen these four pictures, take a look at your own surroundings. What should you do?</p>

<h3 id="e165">Traitors in Prison Have American Sunglasses <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Lianfang, known as the "Hardware King," was brought to trial for the first time by the High Court on the seventh of this month. A reporter from his newspaper went to take pictures. After taking the pictures and when he was leaving the court, his family members followed behind, firmly requesting that he not publish the photos and enticing him by saying, "As long as you agree, you can accept any conditions we offer." It can be seen that Zhang has more than just "hardware"; he also has a lot of "money."</p>
<p>During the High Court's trial of traitors, the famous traitors often maintained their composure when answering questions. For example, the president of the puppet High Court often used the phrase "I'll tell you" in his answers. Xie Baosheng and Zhou Bangjun did not say "defendant" but referred to themselves as "Baosheng" and "Bangjun." Even more so, some traitors still used absurd arguments such as "The Greater East Asia War" and "The Chongqing Regime." It can be seen that their traitorous hearts have not died! Chang Yuqing, the "Anqing Society" leader, who was "famous" in Beijing and Shanghai for murdering patriotic people, absolutely denied it during the trial. Only when the judge said, "Liang Hongzhi also admitted that you did it," was he speechless and unable to argue. After Chang returned to prison, he became estranged from Liang and blamed him for "dragging people down," disregarding their reputations, and a big quarrel broke out. Afterwards, the devil was still concerned about this and was "always unhappy."</p>
<p>Liang Hongzhi was the leader of the "Reformed Government," and Chang Yuqing was the head of the "Huangdao Society." One was a traitor, and the other was a murderer. Both were special figures of the "former Han." According to observations from all sides, it is predicted that these two traitors may be the first to be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>There are no less than two hundred traitors currently imprisoned in the Shanghai prison. Family members visit twice a week to bring them things. All kinds of food, supplies, and clothing are available. Recently, the latest American glass sunglasses have also been found in the prison. It can be seen that the traitors have not forgotten to be "modern" even in prison. As for food, there is no shortage of fruit and Western pastries. Whether the traitors have "good appetites" or "good taste" is puzzling.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming, who responded to Wang Jingwei's telegram by expressing his support, was assassinated in Hanoi at the time, so it is unclear whether he is a traitor, and his identity is unclear. Therefore, his house in Nanjing has become an "unsolved case." Zeng had many properties in the capital in the past. In Xuanwu Lake alone, there were eight very exquisite Western-style houses. There were also more than ten Western-style houses in Cuiming Village. The buildings are very luxurious. The senior staff of the former Army Headquarters and the Capital Police Department are currently renting the houses from the Nanjing Municipal Government on a temporary basis, and the rents are very low. Recently, someone has expressed "keen concern" about "what identity should Zeng be classified as" and has submitted it to the Capital High Court for research. Although Zeng is dead, his property is still there and is worth thinking about.</p>

<p>— Tian Qin</p>
<p>After quite some time, Fourth Generation returned with all the things his father had told him to buy. He hadn't even spent half the money. The remaining pile of copper coins clattered onto the bed. Old Master, without a word, put down his pipe, picked up the wine jug, and drank straight from the spout. Then, one by one, he tossed blue soybeans into his mouth like shooting baskets, making a "ge ba, ge ba" sound.</p>
<p>Fourth Generation squatted on the ground, taking large bites of his sesame cake wrapped with fried dough sticks. Neither father nor son said anything. Each greedily enjoyed their share.</p>
<p>Finally, Fourth Generation blurted out: "Dad! Today, it feels like we're celebrating the New Year. ......"</p>
<p>That was the end of their day.</p>
<p>The result of the civil war bankrupted the countryside, and coupled with years of great disasters, made it even more impossible for this old man and his young son to survive in their hometown!</p>
<p>Old Master hated people who "ran to the sea" (went to the city to seek their fortune) more than anything. However, when the whip of life lashed at his own back, he couldn't help but tread the path he hated most!</p>
<p>Both father and son were kind farmers who had never left their home. Except for going to the market or temple fairs, they had never even seen the county seat. This pair of farmers who were reluctant to leave home now actually stepped into the city and completely changed their profession.</p>
<p>Fourth Generation, relying on the little skills he had learned in the countryside, even joined a troupe and started acting in plays. And their lives really improved a lot.</p>
<p>Just look at Old Master: he was no longer wearing short clothes, but long gowns and mandarin jackets. He was no longer smoking a pipe, but medium-grade foreign cigarettes. And he broke precedent by marrying a Beijing woman with big feet as his wife. Although she was already in her early forties and not very beautiful, city people are city people. She was generous, knew how to talk, and spoke fluent Mandarin, which was much better than his late wife. However, Old Master always felt that her feet were too big, and he was afraid that the villagers would laugh at him when he returned home. Although he had been mixing in the city for quite some time, his standards for marrying a wife had not changed. He still believed that small feet, a white face, black hair, and big eyes were the most standard.</p>
<p>Actually, Old Master didn't dislike his old wife simply because of her big feet. Otherwise, why would she have gotten pregnant so soon after he brought her over!</p>
<p>Although Fourth Generation was now a second-rate martial arts actor in the troupe, his monthly salary was quite good. Apart from expenses, the family of three had a surplus every month. One would think they should be content. However, after arriving in the city, Fourth Generation's horizons widened and his mind became more complex. When he had nothing to do, he often daydreamed, always thinking that relying on this profession for the rest of his life was not a good idea. Although it could solve their livelihood, it was ultimately a despised occupation. He often thought about getting an official position, how impressive it would be to wear a golden-hooped hat. Sometimes, when the family was bored, he would reveal a little of his ambition. Old Master didn't object to his idea. Why wouldn't he want to be a real "Old Master" himself? As for the stepmother, she had nothing to say. Old Master was the head of the family, and if he didn't object to something, it would definitely work out.</p>
<p>However, although Old Master didn't object, he was somewhat nostalgic for their current life. Being an official was certainly good, but without connections, how could it be easy?</p>
<p>The soldiers with the small white flags of "recruiting new soldiers" were everywhere in the alleyways. However, he couldn't start by becoming a soldier. Being a soldier meant fighting wars, and fighting wars every year. Bullets have no eyes. If he had bad luck and died in battle, he wouldn't have become an official and would have lost his life instead. That wouldn't be worth it. Moreover, it was people fighting against their own people. What sense did that make?</p>
<p>Naturally, Fourth Generation had no such plans. He wasn't the kind of unreasonable child who would just do it and immediately abandon the lives of the two elders and run away. He was just thinking and also trying to find such a path, one that wouldn't interfere with the family's livelihood before he dared to change professions.</p>
<p>Although acting was a lowly profession in those years, some dignitaries liked to associate with such people, especially the concubines, who especially liked the pretty-boy actors. This reason was quite puzzling.</p>
<p>Fourth Generation's years of acting had actually allowed him to get to know many such figures, which had a great impact on his later development.</p>
<p>Old Master was really ruthless. If he wasn't going to "run to the sea", he wouldn't go. But once he went, it was for more than a decade. Although there was nothing left for him to miss in his hometown, he still returned to his native land. In fact, he had already sold the only small, dilapidated house a long time ago. He didn't even have a place to live when he came back. What was he coming back for?</p>
<p>In Old Master's mind, it was nothing more than to show off to his fellow villagers, because this time he really became an Old Master. To put it nicely, "all rivers flow to the sea" is also human nature. In any case, Old Master's triumphant return was an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Old Master's arrival caused a sensation in the whole village. It's no wonder, villagers had never seen such a scene. Just the camphor wood trunks alone numbered several, and they were very heavy. In fact, maybe they were filled with torn clothes and rags, but the villagers saw that the porters were struggling so hard, they were sure that they were filled with coins with Yuan Shikai's head on them. So, it spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, that Old Wu (a nickname) was back home rich. Some people started making wild guesses!</p>
<p>Cross-eyed Bian said to Big Sister-in-law: "Hmph, he must have become a bandit. Otherwise, how could he have made such a fortune? Besides drinking and bragging, what skills does he have!"</p>
<p>Second Aunt Fu agreed with her:</p>
<p>"That's right, look, he even snatched a Beijing woman. If he hadn't snatched her, who would marry him, this poor boy!"</p>
<p>"That's right, I bet this woman must be a widow, very rich, just living with this young son. There's no one to help at home, so the old rascal took advantage of the situation and robbed her of both the person and the money. There's nowhere else to hide, so they had to come back home. That must be the case." Baldy's wife chimed in. Unexpectedly, Baldy was coming from behind, and these gossips filled his ears. He was furious, took a quick step, grabbed her hair, and kicked her a few times.</p>
<p>"Damn you, you talk too much, aren't you afraid of causing trouble..." Baldy's wife was crying and wailing as the people who were mediating pulled her away. Naturally, Baldy couldn't pursue her anymore. In this way, the gossip group disbanded.</p>
<p>Old Master ordered people to carry the luggage ashore, then carried his four- or five-year-old second son and got off the boat. Old Master's wife followed closely behind him.</p>
<p>After Old Master got off the boat, the boatman asked again:</p>
<p>"Where are you old folks moving to?"</p>
<p>This question stumped our Old Master. Yes, where should they move to? He didn't even have a home. His face flushed, especially with his wife staring at him with her two eyes, he felt even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>People are, after all, "blessed with inspiration". He thought for a while, "Let's move to Second Master's house."</p>
<p>Who is Second Master? Of course, the boatman didn't know. He didn't know which street or which alley he lived on. Anyway, with Old Master leading the way, he wouldn't go wrong.</p>
<p>After the luggage was moved to Second Old Master's house, they finally settled down.</p>
<p>It's also necessary to introduce Second Old Master. Second Old Master was Old Master's cousin. They had separated their families a long time ago. Second Old Master was quite wealthy, and his family wasn't large. He could be said to be living well in the countryside, so he wasn't interested in the arrival of Old Master's uninvited guests, even though he had returned in triumph. In addition, Second Old Master's wife couldn't get rid of the stinginess of country people. They were eating and drinking as soon as they entered the door, and she was simply eight hundred and twenty times unhappy.</p>
<p>Old Master lost his temper once again on the first day he arrived home. He happened to meet Xi Shun, who was selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, on the street. He was the first to spot Old Master.</p>
<p>"Uncle Old Wu! How are you..."</p>
<p>Old Master was furious when he heard someone call him by his childhood name. He straightened his neck, bulged his eyes, and started to scold him.</p>
<p>"You little bastard? You're so ungrateful. I'm an Old Master now, do you know that? How dare you call me by my childhood name, it's outrageous. Let me tell you, I... I... when I... was in... Jiang... Xi... even the division commanders... had to call... me... Old... Master..."</p>
<p>The more he scolded, the angrier he became, and the more angry he was, the more incoherent he became. Then he pounced on Xi Shun and slapped him. He stumbled, the basket tilted, and sesame cakes and fried dough sticks fell all over the ground. "Ha, ha, ha..."</p>
<p>The onlookers all laughed. Of course, there were still people trying to break it up. Xi Shun didn't back down. While picking up the sesame cakes and fried dough sticks that had fallen on the ground, he also cursed:</p>
<p>"Tiger's tail!" Here, he simply dropped the "Uncle" part altogether. "Xi Shun, forget it." An old man carrying a manure basket advised. After pulling him to the side, he turned around and said to Old Master:</p>
<p>"Old..., Gan Quan! For my sake, don't argue with him. He's young, it's not worth it..."</p>
<p>"Listen to him, the little bastard. He dares to call me by my childhood name..."</p>
<p>"You motherfucking hundred little bastards! You're calling yourself a motherfucking Old Master, who's Old Master are you? You're pretending to be something you're not. How many days have you been wearing pants with crotches? Pay me back, do you remember you still owe me three sets of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks..."</p>
<p>Neither of them would give in. They only didn't fight because someone was trying to mediate!</p>
<p>In the end, Old Master's wife pulled him away.</p>
<p>"Let's go home, aren't you afraid of losing your status arguing with him!"</p>
<p>Old Master felt that his wife's opinion was right when he heard the word "status", so he returned to Second Old Master's house. Xi Shun, seeing that he had left, naturally wasn't angry anymore. Although the sesame cakes had fallen to the ground, there wasn't really any loss. Except for getting a little dirty, they could still be sold for money. Besides, it wasn't for him to eat, so who cared.</p>
<p>"Status?......" Xi Shun heard these two words and felt a little nauseous, he chuckled and walked out of the crowd with his basket. He yelled.</p>
<p>"Sesame cakes and fried dough sticks!"</p>
<p>Second Master and Second Madam seemed to take a laissez-faire attitude towards this matter. Second Master thought that Shou Gen and Fa Chang were both pretty good. Although Fa Chang was more pleasing, he wasn't necessarily going to marry A Dong to Fa Chang. Second Madam simply didn't have time to think about such trivial matters. She was an optimist. When she was happy, she would laugh a lot and lie on the bed and smoke a few pipes of opium, sleeping comfortably. When she was unhappy, she would scold the servants and maids, lie on the bed and smoke a few pipes of opium, and still sleep comfortably.</p>
<p>However, this was not a trivial matter for Chen Family Aunt, Shou Gen's mother. We must understand that for a widow who has only one son after the death of her husband, economic hardship is a matter of course, and at the same time, the desire to have a grandson occupies the most important place in her heart. Even in the countryside, marrying a wife through a proper match requires a considerable expense, and her clear eyes have long placed her hopes for the rest of her life on A Dong. However, if the current situation continues to develop, won't the good dream she has worked so hard to weave be completely shattered?</p>
<p>So she was looking forward to the arrival of Mother He Dong.</p>
<p>Mother He Dong was an outstanding matchmaker, an indispensable figure in the village and town. She was attentive, knew how to talk, was good at smiling, and was quick with her hands and feet. Although she came from a humble background, she could enter and exit various wealthy families and gain the welcome of everyone from top to bottom. She occasionally brought some gifts over, such as two small chicks or half a jar of pickles. When she went home, the basket was always heavier than when she left. The setting sun painted her face red, and her heart was particularly light.</p>
<p>On this day, Mother He Dong arrived, and Chen Family Aunt received her with extra care, brewing tea three times in a row. Mother He Dong was curious, but she didn't want to ask first, so she pretended to be nonchalant and talked at length about the happy event of the Huang family in town the day before yesterday: the bride was pretty, but there were more freckles and blemishes on her face; the master and madam often quarreled, the madam was a showy person who liked to give more money to the people below, but the master always wanted to deduct some, saying that spending money was like scraping water, save as much as you can, ... while exploring Chen Family Aunt's facial expressions, she was surprised at the other party's patience. Fortunately, in the end, Chen Family Aunt finally opened her mouth timidly.</p>
<p>"Mother, to be honest with you, I have something on my mind that I want to ask you for help with."</p>
<p>"Just tell me, if my old body can do anything, I will definitely help you." Mother He Dong immediately catered to her.</p>
<p>"It's also a marriage matter, our Shou Gen is old enough."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's time to get a wife. Fortunately, Shou Gen is an honest and steady person, otherwise, at this age, he would have been sniffing and drilling around like a mad dog. - Who do you have your eye on? I'll go talk to them for you."</p>
<p>"Mother, you are a discerning person, you can see everything clearly, I don't need to say it."</p>
<p>"I really don't know."</p>
<p>"A Dong in Second Master's house, who else?"</p>
<p>"Oh——" Mother finally couldn't help but giggle; "This... it would be proper... for you to tell Second Master and Madam, and it would be done."</p>
<p>"How can I say it myself, and besides -" she paused, and then told her her difficulties one by one. Mother He Dong was an extremely good person, so she naturally agreed readily.</p>
<p>The onlookers naturally dispersed as well. However, with such a commotion, the countryside had talking points.</p>
<p>June in the countryside is sweltering. In the evening, after finishing dinner, everyone has nothing to do. They sit on the roof in groups of three or five, enjoying the cool air, bare-backed, fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans, chatting about anything and everything.</p>
<p>Old Master had made so many jokes on the first day he arrived home, so of course, the topic of conversation for those enjoying the cool air focused on this aspect.</p>
<p>It happened to be the fifteenth of the month, the bright moon hung in the sky, and there wasn't a cloud in sight. The moon goddess seemed especially bright, almost like daytime.</p>
<p>Old Master's family and Second Old Master's family also went to the roof to enjoy the cool air. There were also a few people who came to visit, they all wanted to get more news from Old Master.</p>
<p>Old Master was holding up two photos as if to show everyone. One was a family portrait. Old Master and his wife were sitting in the front, the little son born to the Beijing woman was standing next to them, and a young couple was standing in the back. The man was fully armed, the woman was wearing a long cheongsam, with short hair, and holding a small boy who couldn't walk yet. This young couple was Fourth Generation and his wife, and the small boy who couldn't walk was Old Master's little grandson. This was a genuine three-generation family. The other photo was a solo portrait of Fourth Generation in full uniform, wearing a golden-brimmed hat and carrying a foreign sword. He really looked like a soldier. He was now a squad leader. At most, his rank was a captain. However, Old Master, who came from a peasant background, thought it was amazing to have such a good son, a son who had become an official.</p>
<p>Old Master, with an arrogant expression on his face, passed the photos around for everyone to see.</p>
<p>"××! Our Fourth... Fourth Generation... is really... promising, he's now promoted to squad leader... When we were in... Jiangxi... the house even had... orderlies... serving us... He had to... call... call me... me Old Master, Brother, I'm a big... big man now, you... you're just... Second... Second Master..."</p>
<p>Others just hummed and hawed, listening to him brag alone. Second Master wasn't interested in his words. He could somewhat see through him, so he turned to a few people who came to visit and bragged.</p>
<p>"Fourth Generation is a child with... with popularity, their... division commander likes... him the most, so he considered him his godson... You think, how fast would the division commander's godson... be promoted? As the saying goes, it's easy to be an official if you have someone in the court, wouldn't it be easy to become a regimental commander in the future? When... when our Fourth Generation becomes... a brigade commander... we'll repair the Bodhisattva temple in our village first... this... this... this is the feng shui of our village... Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" The people who came to visit echoed Old Master with a "yes".</p>
<p>"Look, I'm an official too." Old Master's little son was wearing his brother's golden-brimmed hat and yelling to everyone while waving his arms. This was all taught by Old Master and his wife. Originally, the little child didn't want to wear the military hat in the hot weather, but in order to publicize that Fourth Generation was really a military officer, they forced the child to wear it and show it off to the villagers.</p>
<p>"Good boy, put it on, Dad will buy you candy tomorrow..." Old Master told his son privately, so that's how it was done. So his little son wore that golden-brimmed hat everywhere he played.</p>
<p>"Don't jump around, you'll collapse your second uncle's house! This child!" When the little son was doing his duty for his father, the Beijing woman showed off her mother's authority and solemnly taught her little son a lesson.</p>
<p>"You're really a dog with horns, meddling in other people's business. If the child... is happy playing, what... what's it to you?... If... the house collapses; we'll build a new one... we have plenty."</p>
<p>Old Master showed off his power to his wife. Fortunately, his wife didn't respond, so this small disturbance passed, but as a result, the air was silent for a while.</p>
<p>The people who came to visit, dragging their tired bodies, went home to sleep.</p>
<p>"You guys take a rest for a while longer, Big Brother, we're going to sleep, we have things to do tomorrow..." Second Old Master and his wife were polite enough to say these few words, but without waiting for Old Master to respond, they climbed the ladder and went down to the house.</p>
<p>The three members of Old Master's family felt that there was no one to brag to anymore, and they also felt very bored, so they went down to the house to sleep.</p>
<p>In less than half a month after Old Master returned home, the whole village had a bad impression of him. It's no wonder, he would get drunk and scold people all day long, and he would put on the airs of an Old Master whenever he saw someone. Country people have such a strange temper, you have money and power, that's yours, they won't flatter you.</p>
<p>In June three years later, although Fourth Generation had gone through several more civil wars, he still hadn't been promoted to brigade commander. He was still a squad leader, and he had been injured once in a major battle, but fortunately, he hadn't lost his life.</p>
<p>At noon, the streets were quiet. The sun was burning the earth like poisonous fire. People were hiding in the shade to avoid the heat. Wild dogs stuck out their long tongues and panted. Several children were naked, leaning on the sun-scorched stone steps. They looked like they had just returned from swimming in the river, and their bodies were still covered in water that hadn't dried, intending to dry it on the stone steps.</p>
<p>This village is surrounded by water, so all the seven or eight-year-old children living here know how to swim, otherwise the adults wouldn't feel at ease.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of crying came from the edge of the village, so miserable. The sound of crying didn't sound like a local dialect, it was a woman's crying. After a while, the faint crying of a man was also heard. The children covered their ears with their small hands.</p>
<p>"Listen!" The bigger one said "Listen", and the other children quietly pricked up their ears. "I bet Old Wu's little son drowned!" Little Runaway said.</p>
<p>"That's right, he hasn't learned how to swim yet, but he's floating (phonetic reading) in the deep water, so how could he not drown!"</p>
<p>"The adults all say that there are ghosts in the river at noon, he must have been pulled down by a ghost."</p>
<p>"Then we shouldn't go swimming at noon in the future..."</p>
<p>The children's guess was indeed correct. The one who died was really Old Master's little son. The naked little corpse was lying under the shade of a tree by the river. The Beijing woman was crying to death on the corpse, and Old Master's tears were also streaming down. Naturally, there were people watching the commotion, and there were also people trying to comfort him.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the mothers of each family were running under the sun, calling out their sons' childhood names, because the village was rumored to have drowned a child, and they hadn't seen their sons for a long time, so they couldn't calm down.</p>
<p>The children all crowded around the corpse to watch the commotion. The shouting sounds were sometimes clear and sometimes unclear. Some children even ignored their mothers calling them. When their mothers came up to them, they grabbed them and beat and scolded them without saying a word.</p>
<p>"You little bastard, I've been calling you for a long time and you don't answer, are you deaf, are you dumb..." Then they slapped them a few times, and the child cried.</p>
<p>"Go back quickly, don't you dare come out to swim at noon again..."</p>
<p>Old Master cried for a long time, but he couldn't bring his son back to life. He asked someone to buy a wooden box and bury him.</p>
<p>The couple's eyes were straight and red for several days, and they didn't eat for several days, but Old Master hadn't stopped drinking. Moreover, he drank even more than usual.</p>
<p>After the little son died, they didn't receive a letter from the eldest son for many days, and they were really worried. It just so happened that another civil war had started in Jiangxi, and if something unexpected happened, Old Master's life would immediately have problems. He hung his head and was always thinking. The Beijing woman was also plunged into extreme pain.</p>
<p>Misfortunes never come singly. The son wrote a letter saying that the little grandson had also died because of smallpox. Although he didn't get injured in this battle, this battle was just the beginning, and it wouldn't be over for a while.</p>
<p>Finally, he also advised his father a few words, saying that he should treat people kindly everywhere in his hometown, and that his official position was nothing, and he should never say that we are officials and even bully the villagers. These things must never be done!</p>
<p>After Old Master asked someone to read the letter to him, he was very unhappy. Not only did the letter not send any money, but it also brought bad news. In the end, he even lectured his father. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and he simply jumped up and started cursing. "You little bastard, you're lecturing your father now that you're an official. Tomorrow, I'm going to... give... our... our... In-law × Division Commander write a letter... Tell him... to discipline him... properly..."</p>
<p>He was half angry and half showing off his background to the person who read the letter to him.</p>
<p>In-law with the division commander, that's amazing.</p>
<p>The following year, Old Master's luck was even worse! He hadn't received the pension after his eldest son died in battle, and the widowed daughter-in-law was also missing.</p>
<p>The little savings in his hand had long been spent. The few camphor wood trunks he had brought back home were unconditionally given to Second Old Master, but now he didn't admit it. He forced him to pay him five yuan, saying that he hadn't given it to him. Fortunately, Second Old Master had plenty of money. Giving you five yuan didn't matter much, anyway, the trunk was his now.</p>
<p>However, because of the trunk problem, Second Old Master forced him to move out. He rented a small, dilapidated house in Henan to live in. Now, only the two elderly people were left, so of course, he didn't dare to resist.</p>
<p>However, after he moved out, he kept talking about how the old generation's family separation was unclear, and we have to re-separate. If Second Old Master doesn't agree, I'll call our in-law × Division Commander... write... write a letter... to... the county magistrate...</p>

<p>Legal Queries</p>
<p>(1) Peng Jinchen asks: Zhou, nearing forty and still without offspring, has long harbored the desire to take a concubine. His wife has familial ties with my family. In order to achieve his ambition of currying favor with officials, he disregards his self-worth and repeatedly entices my younger sister. My sister is only eighteen, has a weak will, and is blinded by profit, ultimately tacitly agreeing. The other party presses forward rapidly, suddenly proposing marriage. Despite repeated dissuasion, my sister turns a deaf ear to sound advice. I lost my parents young, a lifelong regret, and how could I bear to see my sister ruin herself! I respectfully ask your lawyer to answer: (1) Is there a sound method to resolve this matter? (2) If unavoidable, can I, as her legal representative, sue the other party for attempting to incite a minor to leave her family, and demand compensation for reputational damage?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] If your sister is of age and it is her own free will, there is nothing that can be done. Otherwise, it can be handled according to the article on leaving one's family. (2) Zhenjiang Xu Yanqiu asks: I am a long-time friend of your paper. Seeing the Social Services column, I deeply admire your lawyer for answering the public's difficult questions. In the second year of the Republic, I rented two storefronts from the Jinshan Temple property to run a business. In the twenty-sixth year, when the enemy invaded Zhenjiang, troops were stationed near my business location, searching passing pedestrians, making it impossible to operate. Since the victory, everything has been in the process of recovery. I recently wanted to resume my business, but the landlord is demanding rent for the eight years since, and wants it calculated in silver dollars. In those years, the monthly rent for the two storefronts was four yuan, totaling about 400 silver dollars. Given the current exchange rate for silver, this would amount to 400,000 legal tender. Despite multiple mediations, no agreement has been reached. I ask, concerning the eight years of rent owed, what kind of</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Regarding the standard for increasing rent, according to Shanghai municipal regulations, starting from December of the 34th year of the Republic, city housing is calculated at sixty times the rent of August of the 26th year. From April of this year, it is calculated at one hundred and sixty times the rent of August of the 26th year. However, whether this applies to Zhenjiang needs to be investigated based on local conditions. As for the eight years of unpaid rent, there is no way to convert it into legal tender using the current silver dollar exchange rate.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Harms of Singleness <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>Marriage has a beneficial impact on life in both tangible and intangible ways. According to surveys in various countries on the presence of a spouse and mortality rates, married men and women consistently have lower mortality rates than unmarried or single individuals of the same age.</p>
<p>Why is it that people with spouses have lower mortality rates than single individuals (including widowers and divorcées)? Firstly, for women, entering married life can eliminate the dangers of survival and competition that are inevitable for those without spouses. Secondly, a woman's body is able to fulfill the natural duty of bearing children, which is in line with the process of evolution and development. If one does not conceive or give birth, it is a life that goes against nature, and this will naturally have an adverse impact on health.</p>
<p>As for men, they rush around from morning to night for work, becoming exhausted in the process. They rely on returning home to rest their minds and restore their health. If there is a wise wife at home to provide comfort, this is more effective than any medicine in nurturing vitality. Without a spouse, one lacks this most important protector and cannot obtain this comfort. Furthermore, those who lose the joy of family reunion, unwilling to be lonely, will go to teahouses and wine shops for entertainment, losing their spirits at best and descending into depravity at worst, which will also greatly affect their health.</p>
<p>On the other hand, singleness goes against the national interest. Therefore, I say that single individuals are the sinners of the nation.</p>

<p>— Yi Ming</p>
<p>The eastern clouds, adorned with vivid purplish-brown hues, slowly spread from the gloomy sky. The sun hides behind them, primping; the sparrows in the bamboo forest are still having their sweet dreams; the mountain country girls have already climbed out of their cave-like rooms, groped to put on their clothes, tightly bound their foot-binding cloths, slipped into their five-inch pointed shoes, pushed open the kitchen door, scooped up a large basin of water to wash their faces. With white cloth head wraps neatly folded into half-inch-wide bands on their heads, braids already prepared the night before for sleeping, bags of cyan or white cloth filled with needles and thread in their arms, carrying baskets on their backs, and sickles in their hands, they call out to their sisters up and down the slopes, setting off together to gather pigweed. When tired, they sit down on the mud benches by the fields, take out their work from their arms—embroidering pillowcases, stitching shoe uppers, talking about how skillful Zhang's daughter is, having completed so much needlework, how Li's younger sister has embroidered so many pillows, and how Wang's elder sister is truly suffering, not even having a pair of shoes before getting married. This is during the agricultural off-season.</p>
<p>Around Qingming, the small season for sowing begins, scattering corn and planting beans. Such vast mountainside fields cannot be worked by a single pair of hands and feet. The girls with their braided hair and bound feet have to carry needlework to exchange labor with other families.</p>
<p>The shouts of "Harvesting wheat and transplanting rice" echo, harmonizing with the songs of transplanting rice in the paddies. The girls with their tightly bound feet come and go between the kitchen and the stove, grinding soybean curd, selecting vegetables, preparing meals for a dozen people, as well as food for the piglets, and leading the cattle to the river gullies to drink water.</p>
<p>When the golden rice ears droop in the fields, the farmers seem like oxen unyoked from the plow, happily smiling. The girls also follow the cheers, dropping their needlework and busying themselves with threshing and drying the grain.</p>
<p>The cold winter follows immediately after the autumn harvest. Farm work comes to a temporary halt. In these three winter months, the girls must prepare fuel for the following spring. They invite their companions, carrying sickles and hemp ropes, to the landlord's forest to gather fallen branches blown down by the wind.</p>
<p>Upon returning home at night, they stretch their feet into the ash pit to warm their stiff, frozen feet with the remaining embers, comb their braids, pick up a unburnt embers, and take it to the bed to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Life of Ladies from Old Families <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Living in homes with black lacquered gates hanging with gold-lettered signs that read "Official Residence" or "Jinshi Residence," with screens erected in the courtyards and beaded curtains hanging down, these girls came from distinguished families of generations of scholars. They, too, saw the colorful clouds walking ahead of the sun in the east, and they, too, woke up earlier than the sparrows under the eaves. After combing their hair, putting on their shoes properly, and sweeping and cleaning the house, they would first perform the work of "early rising with three cleans: hair clean, feet clean, and ground clean." Walking to the kitchen, they would learn to cook from the family members. When they had free time, they would sit in their rooms and learn embroidery. If a close female guest came, they would respectfully come out to pour a cup of tea, fill a pipe with tobacco, and then retreat back into their room in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Society, like a peep show, is constantly renewing its patterns. The parents, who pride themselves on their old traditions, do not want their daughters to fall behind. They hire experienced and respected old teachers to teach at home. Thus, after meals, the girls from these distinguished old families also sit in the study and read books with a murmur. They are taught by their parents that only the ability to write letters and keep accounts is necessary. Books like *The Romance of the Western Chamber* and *Dream of the Red Chamber*, which are deemed obscene, should not only be avoided, but even mentioning them is considered embarrassing. Going to school is out of the question.</p>
<p>The roads, winding and twisting, are well built around the city. Monster-like cars with big eyes run faster than horses. The airport is endlessly wide, and the airplanes have to circle several times before they can fly. How beautiful! These news items also reach the ears of the girls from old families from the mouths of their fathers and brothers. But after all, they are daughters of noble families, so how can they show their faces in public to go and see.</p>
<p>People live in the courtyard, so how can you go to the middle hall? The patio is even more out of the question. There are girls who, from the age of thirteen or fourteen until they get married, have never even seen outsiders. These are truly families with good traditions.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Daughter's Love Issues <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Huanbai</p>
<p>Under the loving care of her mother, a girl grows up day by day. When she reaches a certain age and matures, she feels admiration for the opposite sex, and thus love issues easily arise. This issue is related to the happiness of a girl's entire life and is very serious. If you are a person who has been baptized by new ideas, you will of course agree with freedom of love and will never, as people of the past did, choose a marriage partner for her yourself. But if your daughter is only sixteen or seventeen years old now and is already having social interactions with her male classmates, then what attitude will you take?</p>
<p>Perhaps you think that your child is too young and should not be dating yet—well, I admit that you have keen insight, showing that you are a wise mother. However, when you severely scold your daughter and teach her to follow your wishes, I think you will mostly fail. Perhaps she will reverse her past gentleness and obedience and express dissatisfaction. Then, you will be a little sad and say that your child has "gone bad," so you desperately control her, not allowing her to step out of the house except to go to school or visit relatives. You think that doing so will probably achieve the desired goal, but I think you will still fail. She may be even more disobedient to your words, or she may obey outwardly but still be angry inwardly!</p>
<p>According to psychological theory, the best way is—you must never hurt your daughter's self-esteem. You must treat her love affair with due respect, and you must consider it from all angles in front of her. Do not use your maternal authority to subdue her, and then express your own ideas.</p>
<p>If you ignore your daughter's love issues, it is truly extremely dangerous! But you cannot just control her blindly. It is best to take an attitude of participating and offering advice.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Save the Illegitimate Children <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>The famous French novelist Guy de Maupassant, in his masterpiece "The Son Who Killed His Parents," narrates the story of an illegitimate child who, unable to bear the contempt of the world, killed his parents and then confessed in court, saying, "They sought pleasure for themselves and unintentionally gave birth to a child. They stubbornly suppressed this child, and unexpectedly it later fell to me to suppress them." Although this is a novel, is it not a reflection of reality?</p>
<p>The issue of illegitimate children has been around for thousands of years. There are already legal regulations for it, so logically it should be a non-issue. But the tragedy in Maupassant's novel is still visible everywhere. It is clear that this is no longer a problem that can be solved by law, but one that requires a new ethical and moral perspective to resolve.</p>
<p>First of all, we must save young men and women. They must have certain standards when dating and must be cautious. They must use reason to restrain the overflow of emotions. Otherwise, while the temporary emotional tide is satisfied, it sows the seeds of tragedy. In order to destroy this ambiguous evidence, they have to strangle the small individual. You think, is there anything more reckless or more cruel than this?</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prevent the tragedy caused by illegitimate children, we sincerely request people to cherish the lives of young people and not waste them recklessly. Moreover, love is definitely not just physical satisfaction. In order to respect the personality of both men and women, it takes great perseverance to restrain emotions!</p>
<p>Secondly, if an illegitimate child is unfortunately produced, the parties involved should bravely come out and admit it. This is so that these innocent children can have their identities confirmed, and they must not be as selfish and cowardly as the parents in Maupassant's novel. Because this behavior is not a sin in itself, but only a little reckless. So why create this sin yourself, causing your conscience to be eternally condemned!</p>
<p>The general public in society should change their views on illegitimate children. "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me." Know that thousands of illegitimate children are killed because of the fear of public opinion! Contempt and ridicule, these sharp blades, have killed thousands of lives. We cannot ignore this blood-stained fact and should no longer arbitrarily use this bloodless killing blade.</p>
<p>Children are innocent, so what does it matter if they are illegitimate or legitimate. After this great massacre, mankind has a high degree of awareness and is seeking lasting peace. For this tragic problem that has been around for thousands of years, I hope everyone will bring out their human conscience and no longer allow us to find these small lives abandoned in the great alleys and remote rural areas.</p>
<p>The baby in the picture above was born in Detroit, Michigan, USA, and is named Michael. Since he was two or three months old, he has liked to use his feet to hold things. However, his hands are also normal and used flexibly. Michael is now about eight months old. In the picture, he is demonstrating using his feet to hold a milk bottle.

<h3 id="e178">The Balance of Creation <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Wen</p>
<p>Recently, I have read many literary works written by young friends and found that while their ideas are very correct, their forms cannot achieve perfection or come close to it. This reminds me of the issue of content and form in art.</p>
<p>Literary works are art. A good artistic creation must not only have good content but also a good form. We know that the process of artistic creation, in short, can be divided into two steps: the first is combining images, and the second is expressing images. Form is the image, and content is the consciousness contained in the image. All artistic creations that are rich in ideals and have vitality must have both rich content and perfect form.</p>
<p>That being said, artists cannot intentionally regard content and form as two completely different things during the creative process. They are originally unified and inseparable. The preface to the Book of Poetry says: "Poetry is where the will goes. In the heart it is the will; spoken it is poetry. Emotion moves within, and takes form in words..." The "emotion" that moves within and the "poetry" that takes form in words are originally one and two, and two and one. Therefore, we must pay attention to the "balance of creation."</p>
<p>What is the "balance of creation?" It is a work in which content and form are very harmonious and very unified. Such a work has achieved "balance" in terms of content and form, which means it is a good creation. Here, we will not discuss the troublesome issues that have long been debated in literature, such as whether form determines content or content determines form. We just want to think about a few words that Western philosophers have said:</p>
<p>-- Nothing is inside, nothing is outside.</p>
<p>Whatever is inside is also outside.</p>
<p>“Nichts ist drinnen, nichts ist draussen, denn was innen, das ist aussen”</p>
<p>These words fully illustrate a state of seamless integration when artistic creation achieves "balance." Friends who aspire to literary writing may wish to give them some thought.</p>

<p>Waiting for a single drop or a gnawed bone to leak from the demon's mouth,</p>
<p>Then they swarm, veins bulging, baring fangs, vying with each other.</p>

<p>The lingering stains are the saliva of the lackeys' scorn.</p>
<p>My soul entered the world of lead type,</p>
<p>Like a lost wanderer in the wilderness throwing himself into the niche of a dilapidated temple.</p>

<p>It is Lu You's tragic roar!</p>
<p>All this invigorates my congealing blood,</p>
<p>I spit a mouthful of contempt at the contempt of the lackeys!</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I stand firm, fist clenched, gazing at the dark midnight sky,</p>
<p>The flow of blood throughout my body is fiery warm and strong.</p>
<p>I will use justice to strike a spark in this hell,</p>
<p>To ignite the conscience of the slaves that has not yet become damp and moldy;</p>
<p>Tell the demonic bandits and lackeys that they will see the day,</p>
<p>When the human flesh in their bowls are bombs!</p>
<p>At that time, all you ghosts and monsters of the night, look!</p>
<p>Will the sun appear on the horizon!</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>In such severe cold weather, Xiao Hong was only wearing an old thin cotton coat, and a single cloth pair of pants underneath. Before dawn, she had to get up and go out to buy vegetables, then cook breakfast. Poor Xiao Hong's hair and eyebrows were covered in frost when she returned from outside every morning, frozen into ice! But she couldn't utter a word about the cold, otherwise the boss's wife would scold her for pretending, saying, "These days, I am only taking in Xiao Hong to be a child bride, but I am not taking in Xiao Hong to be a young mistress! So she has to do some work. The Liao family's grain cannot be eaten for free!" In fact, the boss's wife's intention was to hire a perpetual long-term worker without spending any money. Naturally, Xiao Hong didn't dare to argue. She had often heard her mother say: A wife is always bound to suffer grievances. A young wife (the colloquial term for "child bride") will suffer even more torment. Moreover, her tailor father had told her that Liao Dong was not the boss's wife's biological son, so even Liao Dong was not in her heart, let alone Liao Dong's child bride? Understanding these things, Xiao Hong could only endure! She thought that once Liao Dong grew up, she could also get ahead. Like Liao Dong himself, she eagerly hoped that he would grow up quickly. She pinned all her hopes on Liao Dong! She worked hard and endured hardships, but the treatment she received was terrible! After she cooked three meals, serving the boss's wife and the others after they had finished eating, she could only fill her stomach with rice soaked in salt water. The boss's wife never thought to leave her some leftover food. In this weather where water turns to ice, the boss's wife ordered her to wash clothes basin after basin, but she was not allowed to use hot water because it was too expensive. While Xiao Hong was washing, the water in the basin froze over. The boss's wife had never seen this, much less considered it. What would happen to the hands of someone washing clothes in ice? Just like that, after finally finishing washing the clothes, the boss's wife told her to make shoes and socks for Boss Liao, her own son Liao Dong, and herself. Xiao Hong's fingers often bled under the needle, one stitch after another, as if piercing her heart! But Xiao Hong endured it with gritted teeth, never uttering a sound in front of or behind people. Only when she lay down on the bed to rest at night, the thin blanket couldn't keep out the cold, and her limbs were curled up all night, unable to straighten, her whole body without a trace of warmth. Then she thought: If she were at home, no matter how poor her mother was, she would burn a few pieces of firewood for her to keep warm. But here, she couldn't get near the brazier of the boss's wife even a step. Therefore, she cried, she quietly complained that her parents should not have sent her here! She would rather freeze or starve to death at home! But she was not willing to suffer endless torment here. Even if she froze or starved to death, her parents wouldn't know! Having no relatives to rely on, although she had a betrothed husband in name, she had never exchanged a single word with him until now. She was disheartened, she was sad! She felt that this day was like a black night with no dawn in sight until she sobbed and drifted into a dream, and only then did she truly get respite.</p>
<p>Boss Liao felt that Xiao Hong was even thinner than when he first saw her before she came to their house, and seeing her busy all day long, he felt very uneasy. So one time, he said to the boss's wife:</p>
<p>"Xiao Hong is not in good health, don't have her do too much work, she will be exhausted if this goes on! The weather is cold, it's pitiful."</p>
<p>But the boss's wife didn't think so at all. Said:</p>
<p>"When we took her in, it was originally to help me with my work, and you agreed to this. What? Don't tell me I have to serve her now?"</p>
<p>The boss's wife's tone was somewhat annoyed! She thought to herself, "Even the child bride of his first wife's son is being protected." Therefore, she felt even more antipathy towards Xiao Hong.</p>
