<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿四日電〕廬山夏令營開學典禮，二十四晨十時於傳習學舍樓上大禮堂舉行，到學員八三八人，蔣主席親臨致訓，歷時十五分鐘始畢。主席致訓時曾請觀禮之丁惟汾，程伯廬等就座，典禮於十時二十五分完舉。蔣主席先返行館休息，嗣於十二時五十五分重來營舍，與千餘員生及記者聚餐，主席甫入坐時，歡聲頓起，掌聲震瓦，約三分鐘之久。主席與梁寒操，羅家倫，鄭彥攀，谷正鼎，翁文瀕，劉建羣同席，記者席設兩旁，主席時與梁寒操，谷正鼎談話，用飯旣畢，覩其鄰座女生，尙慢吞細嚼，不禁莞爾。一時半主席起立，向全營致訓謂，今日是我們工作的開始，旋於歡呼與掌聲中，由翁文灝陪同退出食堂，至營本部視察，並與該營合影，二時正返行館。</p>
<p>蔣主席訓詞全文</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿四日電〕蔣主席在廬山夏令營之訓詞如次。自民國二十六年七月七日抗戰開始廬山暑期訓練團結束以來，到現在已滿了九年。這九年中間，我們國家民族遭遇了空前未有的艱危，幸賴全國軍民流血犧牲，始能獲得最後的勝利。當此勝利以後的第一個夏季，我們全國靑年子弟，都能够參加廬山夏令營來受訓，實在是一個難得的機會。今天入營的時候，希望大家要認識我們入營受訓的意義和目的，在各位敎師官長指導之下，硏究學習，修養身心，尤其要砥礪品德，鍛鍊志節，不失爲三民主義的信徒，完成你們革命建國偉大的使命。</p>
<p>大家都知道，自九一八事變以後，我們中國天災人禍，連年不斷，內憂外患，交迫而來，迄於民國二十一年，國家民族的危機，達於極點，其時，國內人士大多數對民族復興的前途和革命事業的成功，都喪失了自信心，以爲國家危機已無可拯救，正當這樣國家存亡危急，人心萎靡不振的時候，我們就在民國廿二年夏季，創辦廬山訓練團，從此每年一次，召集軍政幹部，硏究國民革命的形勢，討論對外對內的大政方針，勵志養氣，自强不息，準備與國內外一切反動侵略勢力以及假革命反革命者總決鬥，最後到了民國廿六年暑期，日寇侵略中國，日甚一日，逼迫我們走到最後關頭，忍無可忍，乃決定對日發動全面抗戰，於是本黨領導軍民，集中力量，再接再厲，愈挫愈奮，苦戰八年，到了今天，卒能達到驅除敵寇，光復國土的目的，可以說這個勝利都是從廬山訓練團五年暑期訓練所獲得的效果。這五年廬山暑期訓練，可以說是我們中華民族起死回生，轉危爲安的唯一樞機，這種偉大的歷史意義，是我們一般育年子弟不可不知的。</p>
<p>惟其過去的廬山訓練，有這種偉大的成就，所以我們今日廬山夏令營的官長，學生，特別要認淸你們所負使命的重大了。要知道，我們今年廬山夏令營，不比往年的夏令營，所以我們在營裏不僅要修養身心，研究學術，而且要認淸目前的時局，革命的形勢，以及我們國家民族的前途所在。因之，我們要特別硏究如何來求得社會的安定，人民的福利和國家的統一，確保我們全國軍民八年來犧牲流血所獲得的抗戰偉大的勝利，來實行三民主義，完成中華民國現代的建設。必須對於這些問題，都有了明白的解答，而且能够身體力行，實事求是，繼續我們抗戰的精神，毋負我們革命的志節，養成偉大的人格，領導資年，爲民前鋒，始終一致，不失爲民衆的模範，不失爲三民主義的信徒，然後方能達到我們此次參加廬山夏令營受謂的目的。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕外記者招待會，廿四日午後四時半舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長鍇主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>問，和平商談是否不久即將重開，在南京抑在牯嶺？</p>
<p>彭部長答，和平商談從未停止，南京牯嶺均可隨時舉行。</p>
<p>問，日前中央日報謂，政府將實施政治協商會議之決議，此消息正確至何程度？</p>
<p>彭部長答，政府實施政協決議之努力，如政府接收整個東北，整　軍隊，恢復交通等，均遭遇不測之阻碍。最近，政府又曾決定自動實施政協最重要之決議，則定期召開國民大會，此日期距離相當遙遠，以便有充分準備時間，然共方又反對此日期，而未能舉出充分理由，政府仍於此方向繼續努力。總之，目前經濟方面最重要之事，莫過於恢復鐵路交通，尤其山東各鐵路，此事辦到，於物價將有重大影響，在經濟上，此爲最重要之一個因素。政治方面之重要措施，無逾於召開國民大會，蓋此舉爲結束訓政，開始憲政之樞紐，紛各方一數促成。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕從事調查軸心戰敗國賠償問題之杜魯門總統私人代表鮑萊，本日在招待記者會中，指責蘇聯過份搬走東北之工業設備，並力主依照波茨坦協定實行歐洲之賠償計劃。鮑氏所作之初步報告，包括歐亞兩洲四萬九千英里旅程之經過。</p>
<p>鮑氏在其所撥就之文告中稱：「余之報告，查得主要之三點如下：朝鮮北部蘇軍管理區內一切工業設備，尚無大量搬走之情形，不少日本之工業雖仍處於停頓狀態，但各種設備完整無缺，緯度卅八度以南之工業，依靠北部之工業而北部之工業則依靠南部，朝鮮若能獲得日本輕工業，則在工業上亦可獲得不少幫助。東北之情形，就搬運工業設備而言，與朝鮮之情緒適巧相反。據我等在瀋陽，撫順鞍山及哈爾濱等處所見之例子而論所有電力，鋼絨採礦，加氣及其他製造工廠，在蘇軍佔領時期，凡可以移動之設備，均被搬運一空，此種工業機器不能留存原地，實為遺憾，此種機器幾為東北天然資源之極頂，在遠東堪稱最大之天然資源，九萬萬人民之生活與幸福，曾受此等工廠之惠。據余之意見，遠東區人民至少需一世紀方能恢復其損失，波茨坦協定下之賠償計劃，尚不能順利實行，此種失敗，一部份因若干國家不願視應國為整個之經濟單位，一為在波茨坦會議中所同意者，除非各佔領國能和衷共濟，努力覆行波茨坦協定，否則吾人將重蹈第一次世界大戰之覆轍。第一次世界大戰後，協約國包括美國，資助重建德國在第二次世界大戰中用以對吾人作戰之戰爭機構，當時吾人並未憶及主要之目的，為解除德國之戰爭潛能，此次吾人必須避免此等錯誤，波茨坦協定為防止此種悲劇之保證，希望無一國家或國家集團將強迫取消波茨坦協定。」鮑氏繼稱：有一種政策已在考慮中，即德國對蘇之賠款將予以扣留，以便抵消蘇聯自東北搬走之物資。鮑氏又稱：美國對於蘇聯要求德國賠款一百億美元一節，從未予以同意，渠本人亦不贊成。鮑氏重申渠本人及美國官方對波茨坦協定之信念。鮑氏又稱：日本在東北之投資連數十億元之钜，其中約有二十億元已被奪去。東北現正重複成為一種晨業之經濟，鮑氏並透露渠擬設法加連行動，將日本若干工廠移至東北，盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟將軍曾向華盛頓遠東委員會建議此種步驟。</p>

<h3 id="c22">地方政治之路 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>浙江全省行政會議，已於本月二十日開幕，連日就施政綱領，三年建設計劃，以及其他行政措置，分別加以審查，各出席代表並對於民政，財政，田糧，教育，建設，治安，兵役，公益，暨地方自治等事宜，紛紛提出議案，不下一百五十餘件，亦將分門別類，詳加討論。在此國步艱難地方困苦之際，浙省沈鴻烈主席召開行政會議，討論地方的應興應革，積極推行地方自治，格外覺得意義重大。我們雖然置身都市之中，最近又因為國是的紛紜莫解，國際的波蘭迭起，我們的視線，常常注射到國內外局勢的發展，但是我們的內心無時不懷念着地方，關切着地方，因為地方政治不弄好，建國就等於在空中建築樓閣，而國家不建好，在國際的地位必然降低。所以我們對浙省行政會議的召集，不僅重視，而且抱着極大的期望。猶憶沈主席蒞浙之前，道經上海，旅滬浙人曾以建設浙江為模範省相期許，故浙江全省行政會議之成敗，不獨浙江一省有關，且與一般的地方政治有關。</p>
<p>說道地方政治，就覺得地方早已糜爛不堪。在抗戰期間，為了支持國家的既定國策，曾不顧一切，以廣大的人力與物力，貢獻於國家，以求達抗戰必勝的目的。八年以來，地方的精疲力盡，奄奄一息，早已盡人皆知。到了勝利以後，因為共黨問題，使國家大局仍然不能安定，任何地方自也會多少受着影響。在中共控制下的所謂「解放區」，固不必說，就是在素稱富庶之區的江浙一帶，人民生計，尤其是農村生活，真可說苦不堪言。全國人民束緊肚帶，咬緊牙關，含辛茹苦了八年，才贏得了勝利，殊不料國家勝利而人民疾苦依然，甚至有水深火熱之歎，政府將何以對得起人民！所以身為「民之父母」的地方長官，第一任務先須了解民間疾苦，而施政的第一步，乃在如何先讓人民休養生息，聽他們從戰爭的遺燼中逐漸蘇醒過來，各省如此，浙江亦不能例外。</p>
<p>解除民困的辦法，不一而足；但是最重要的，必須切實易行。如只知高談闊論，固然娓娓動聽，但是不切實際，不但未必就能減輕人民的痛苦，有時或反而增加了人民不能安居樂業的因素。所以今天地方當局，首應與民休息，少做幾件苛擾人民的事情，老百姓已經萬分感激的了。人民對於政府的希望很簡單，第一是操守廉潔，第二是辦事有效率。而眼前廢除苛雜，減輕人民的負担，更是刻不容緩。我們雖也反對「無為而治」的政治哲學，但目覩今日千蒼百孔的地方情形，實在覺得政府不能不從培養元氣着手。「留得青山在，不怕沒柴燒」。我們要為老百姓呼籲，先讓他們留下些「青山」罷，然後將來可以貢獻他們的「柴草」。</p>
<p>目下我國農村的情形，率直地說，「十九省區報災荒，三千萬人在饑餓」。整個農村，已瀕於破產的困境。如何使農村復蘇？實為當前最嚴重的問題，就以浙江而言，農村人力和耕牛的恐慌，與肥料的缺乏，也成了令人頭痛的難題。中美農業技術合作團的美國專家早已到了中國，雖負有復興農村的任務，但是「農業科學化」，在我國知識落後的中國農村，在實踐上當仍佈着極多的難關。故對於農村的普及教育，我們以為尤其應加努力。</p>
<p>我們研究世界各國的政治，深知各國莫不有其基層組織。國父孫中山先生所規劃的建國方略，也首先着眼於以縣為自治單位的基層組織。故在今日中國，欲實行民主政治，非先切實推行地方自治不可。中山先生的民權主義，主張先訓練人民在各地方使選舉，罷免，創制，複決等四種政權，使之充分表現民意。蔣主席所提倡的新縣制，其主要精神，也在「加強地方組織，促進自治事業，以奠定革命建國的基礎。」所以建國復興的工作，應從縣的一級開始，而省不過居於中央與縣之間，負其推行中央政令和監督地方自治之職責。浙江省政，如果認真要在此建國復興時期，為全國的模範，走向政治民主化的大道，則浙省當局對於如何提早完成地方自治，應有非常的努力，而養成人民的法治精神，尤為當務之急。</p>
<p>我國一部政治思想史，雖然很早就流露着民主思想，但數千年來的傳統觀念，重禮治而不重法治，實亦無可諱言。所以一般社會的法治精神，還需要大大的提倡與培養。尤其在目前，一般下級地方的行政，更應該特別重視法治。中國俗諺，向有「閻王好見，判官難當」的申訴，可見高級長官或許還重視法律，而胥史吏皂役，狐假虎威，實在使人民難受，現在既欲推行地方自治，地方的事就該讓人民選出他們信任的人負責去辦，不必再借手於官治。而被選出來辦自治的人，尤其應該尊重法治。如此由下而上，法治精神普遍養成，則民主的優點自能發揚光大，而今日地方政治的通弊，也可望一掃而光。與其空唱民主，不如腳踏實地地去努力，推行地方政治，各省固都應如是，而正在開行政會議的浙省政府，我們以為宜着先鞭。</p>

<p>〔聯合社麥金來號上廿三日電〕氣象學家預測七月廿五日天氣良好，可投擲第一顆在水面下爆炸之原子彈，使七十五艘船隻遭受意想不到之巨大壓力。密布於比基尼島上空之濃雲，已隨熱帶氣氛向南移開百哩。水面下爆炸無需完美條件，但須有風直達二萬呎高處，自東而西，吹去含有輻射綫之水珠或雨點。天空亦需相當晴朗，以便攝影記錄爆炸情形。據某科學家稱：在水面下爆炸時之震動，將百倍於七月一日之空中爆炸。科學部隊主任沙易博士稱：在水面下爆炸時，大概並無閃光可見，祗有一道噴泉，自　　形之水面穿出，高達二三哩。海洋學家預測此水柱枝幹分披，水花四佈，有如一顆高大之松樹，蔚為奇觀。科學家又語言此水柱並不沸滾，亦少蒸汽發出。原子彈激起之羽狀水柱，比較狹小，其尖幾同固體，有如砲彈激射，最初速度約每秒鐘二千呎，爆炸後在幾分之一秒鐘內，礁湖中上升水柱之下將成一大窟窿，形如巨鍋，鍋口廣達二千五百呎，將使以前餘呎下面之湖底暴露，直徑約在一二百呎之間。因爆炸力向側面推開，致形成此巨穴，惟各靶子船除主力艦亞干窿斯外，預料可不致　陷在巨穴之內。科學家預料原子浪不致衝過比基尼島，大約僅向島內衝進三四百呎為止。</p>

<p>〔聯合社原子彈試騐參觀艦阿派拉欽號廿三日電〕原子彈浇水爆炸，水中數輻射之X光綫　　地爆炸　　　　險。水面下爆炸將一百萬噸左右之海水拋入空中，其中多量海水均發射X光綫及其他不甚危險之輻射綫。海水本身不致具有　　　之輻射性，但海中之　　及其他普通原子　，將因受輻射綫之影響而灼熱非常。大量海水將向艦船傾注，此外並將發生濃霧中含X管線原　，隨風飄盪，　　艦船。據投擲廣島原子彈之巴森斯少將稱：當場將有大量　水丙射綫如陣雨之落下，此種海水自艦上蒸發時，一部份丙射綫或X光綫或被蒸發，但大部份或將留於加班上面。此外，水面下爆炸數秒鐘後，蒸氣之雲霧上面，預料將發生另一種丙射綫或X光綫之危險。此種蒸氣通過艦船上空，將有輻射綫遺留船上。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕榮德生綁案，經軍警各機關努力通緝，先後捕獲匪首及從犯逾二十名，另有斯案要犯朱產生（化名徐夢麟），遠遁福州，嗣經市警局偵悉後，亟電福州水警總隊，派警馳往，在國際飯店將該犯捕獲，由市警局派幹員搭輪前往迎提，已於昨午零點三十分許抵滬，歸案辦理。據該犯在福州水警隊供稱，四十七歲，無錫人，無業，住新閘路東斯文里一三一號，曾於民國十六年間，爲盜案被處徒刑十五年。對於綁架榮德生案，曾担任內綫因為我的先生（即所謂老頭子）榮炳根，他是榮德生之親戚、遠在七年前，榮之廠內有事，一切均由我先生處理，彼時我隨先生常去，因此我認識榮德生甚熟。至於綁架經過，緣有袁仲杼者，同我相識多年，在三月底，路上與袁相値，彼約我至其家中談天，抵其寓所後，遂談及彼上次被捕時用去法幣兩百萬元，現下手中很拮据，很想對榮德生動動腦筋，但不認識他本人，你對他很熟，請你帮帮忙。我當時問他怎樣帮忙。彼說，祗要我領去認識榮德生的面孔就行，別的都不用我管，讓他們去辦。我當時允諾，約他四月初三上午八時在大三元茶室碰頭，届時前往，與袁會晤後遂同至中正南路江西路口等候，至十時許，果見榮德生乘坐二一一六二號黑色汽車經過，我遂對袁說，坐在汽車左邊的就是他，袁注視後說，我認識了，乃各返家。臨別袁囑我三日後至彼家會晤。至期，我至袁寓，與彼相見，並有袁之友人張明達（眞姓駱綽號老頭子）亦在坐，袁問我你今天再領我去看榮德生的面孔，我遂與袁同至中正東路江西路口，約十時許，榮德生汽車又駛過，袁仲杼上前細看後，說我已認識，現在姓鄭的也在二馬路看，這次看過好了，將來事體成功再來通知你。語畢，我遂回家，逾二十餘日後，我見報紙上登載榮德生被綁消息，後在黃河路一燕子窠內　着袁仲杼，彼謂這件事非常困難，無從接洽，敎我到鄉下去避風頭，當有消息通知我，下次在四馬路小毛娘燕子窠內會面。我遂往無錫暫避。約二星期後，在小毛娘燕子窠內與袁相値，彼謂事體弄好，錢已放在張明達處，三日後再交。第四日在小毛娘家見面，袁當給我美金五千元，謂人數太多，你少用一點，上海現在已不能住，最好離開此地。我遂回寓，逾一星期後，遄返常州橫林鄉下，收買蘭子約百餘斤，用去一百餘萬元，又約一星期返滬，在大東茶室吃茶時，由友人孟阿二（名有章）之介紹，與鄧鏗輪買辦沈伯民相識，沈談及福州糖便宜，擬合資前往購買。當由孟沈及我商妥各出資兩百萬元，共六百萬元，托沈購買，我遂將十兩重之余條一根交沈伯民，折算法幣二百萬元。我因上海風聲太緊，遂籍買糖爲由，乘鄧鏗輪同來福州，六月廿九抵達福州，開國際飯店六號房間，後移三號房間，至七月六日下午六時許，我外出乘凉時，被水警總隊逮捕。至於沈盂二人對於綁架榮德生事，概無所知。到福州時，僅帶法幣九萬五千元，抵福州後，一切零用開銷，均由沈伯民借給我，計四十萬元，請他在作價二百萬元之余條內扣除云云。又據市警局負责人語記者云，朱犯雖已引渡來滬，因承辦斯案之警員往返多日，沿途備嘗辛勞，精神疲憊，俟小憇後，重行將該犯吊出，嚴予偵訊，錄取口供。至於偵悉朱爲榮案要犯之經過，十分曲折且亦凑巧，因有某警員與朱同住一弄，瞥見朱得贓後採購家具，服裝華麗，逈非昔比，於是引起注意，乃多方探査，六月廿五日曾報上峯後，率警前往搜査其家，發覺朱本人已離滬，並悉其妻亦回橫林，因此益覺懐疑，乃搭車趕往橫林，捕獲其妻，並抄出美金三千元，鑽戒金鐲各一，帶滬偵訊，始和盤托出。翌日上午又得一密報，謂是日上午有一裁縫者，伴送朱上鄧鏗輪去台灣、其時輪已駛出，經警務當局拍電至福州水上警察總隊余總隊長，請其協助，一面俟鄧鏗輪數日後進吳淞口時派警將買辦沈伯民逮捕，供出朱在福州。該輪重行外航時，當派幹員張發祥·陳先榮·任公琴等搭乘該輪前往，迨抵福州，朱犯業已由水警隊就擒矣。</p>

<h3 id="c78">優待抗戰有功各廠　准接辦優等敵廠　以鋼鐵機器五金廠居多數 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：行政院刻爲優待後方工業界起見，業已就後方工業界中，選擇規模較大，管理完善，業務對抗戰頗有貢獻之工廠十三家，特分別予以優先權，接辦業務產品類似之敵產工廠。此十三廠中，以鋼鐵機器五金廠佔多數，此外尚有顏料，橡膠，電器，鉛筆，石棉等廠。所接辦之敵產各工廠，亦將擇其設備較佳，略具生產規模者。此事現正由經濟部與敵偽產業處理局接洽中，一俟接治就緒，即將撥交各指定之工廠接辦。聞各指定接辦之工廠，亟望政府當局，對該項敵產工廠設備之估價，應設法求其低廉合理。最高估價，望能不超過美國同機機器之時價。否則，各廠勢須向美訂購大批新機器。該項機器，旣非短時間所能辦到，同時尚須耗用大批國家外匯資金，實非所宜。又估定合理之價格後，各廠望能先付價銀總額百分之三十，其差額分於五年內平均拔還。此項優待接辦之敵產工廠中，有若干廠業已開工生產，且已接受外界定貨。聞接辦時決不停工，且無礙於生產及交貨之進行云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕邇來紙價普遍趨跌，記者特走訪紙業中人，探詢紙業近况。據吿：自六底銀根抽緊以還，本市各紙號爲調度頭襯計，頗多將手中存貨斬售，故行市日趨下游。蓋以近來各處交通，時受阻礙，紙品外銷轉呆。而一方面則外洋來貨日增一日，遂成本市紙價，普遍下跌之現象。茲舉例以明之：普通對開白報紙，現每令約一萬四五千元。加拿大白報紙，現每令約二萬七八千元。較旬日前約跌去三成。以最近來自蘇俄之東貨王子紙一批而言，每令價僅二萬二千元。再以黃紙版而言，去年十月間，每噸價達一百五十萬元，惟自經中國紙業公司一再拋售後，最近價已跌至每噸五十四萬元。然而目下外貨之來本，則日見增加。例如加拿大白報紙，數月前抵滬成本價，每噸約美金一百二十餘元。近來則已漲至每噸美金三百餘元。平均每令成本，約合法幣一萬五千元。如再加計定貨數月間折息之耗損，進口紙商之利潤，已無數月前之豐厚矣。如以本街存貨而言，亦不能謂豐，然亦不致短　。而一般造紙廠商，則仍因勞工成本增高，原料不廉，產品成本無法减低。他方面則價廉物美之外貨源源　到，業務仍屬一籌莫展。處境極爲苦悶云。</p>

<p>夏令生活</p>
<h3 id="c87">太陽眼鏡　是季節裝飾品　是護目的恩物　介紹你幾項重要知識 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>在烈日當空盛暑　人的夏天，太陽眼鏡是極普　的東西，彷彿像香港衫和短褲一樣。都會裏的仕女們，戴太陽眼鏡固然是爲了護目，但也有季節裝飾品的意味，存在其間。試想在白色的皮鞋，白色的服裝和白色的皮膚之上，添上了一副黑色的眼鏡，把最足以表現人類情緒的一對烏黑的眼珠隱藏在後面，極容勿使人發生一種神秘的感覺。</p>
<p>祇要稍一注意路上來來往往的行人，就可以想像一夏天太陽眼鏡銷路的可觀。至於在一向喜歡標新立異的美國，銷路當然更其要大得多，據說每年所售出的太陽眼鏡，總數達二千萬副左右。</p>
<p>但是以太陽眼鏡作爲裝飾點綴的固然不乏其人，然而它的主要目的，還是護目。現在，我們要提出一個問題，就是太陽眼鏡究竟護目不護目？</p>
<h3 id="c88">什麼樣的太陽眼鏡　不能保護你的眼睛 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>據美國統計所得：夏天戴太陽眼鏡人愈多，患眼病者也日增不已，許多人都發現眼球上有盲點。某著名眼科專家，曾經設過：太陽眼鏡給予眼睛的舒適是極成問題的，在大多數情形之下，簡直根本沒有保護能力可言，</p>
<p>原來，太陽的輻射，是由許多種不同的光綫所形成的。除了看得見的光綫之外，還有肉眼所看不見的紫外光綫和刺眼的熱綫。品質低劣的太陽眼鏡，猶如一塊燻過和染過顏色的玻璃一樣，祇能阻住耀眼的看得見的光綫，但是它不能有效的　淸看不見而可能有害的光綫。通常，在光亮的日光之下，人類的眼簾會得自行調節，祇讓必要量的光錢通過眼球而在眼膜產生一個淸楚的印象。但是，黑色的太陽眼鏡阻止了看得見的光綫，以致眼簾比在不戴眼鏡的情形下張得更開些，而使眼睛內部敏感的部份，暴露於鏡片所不能阻止而對於眼部有害的光錢之中。</p>
<h3 id="c89">戴太陽眼鏡的婦人 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>

<p>— 陸英</p>
<p>你當然吃過冰咖啡，但是也知道有幾種怎樣的做法嗎？你一定會說「那是够簡單的，有兩種。」是的，兩種。一種是煮了咖啡，放在冰箱中一冰就得。另一種，倘若沒有冰箱的話，可以先把咖啡候它冷下來，再放幾塊冰進去。</p>
<p>可是，這些都不是好辦法。因爲咖啡之中含着　富的汕質，放在冰箱裏一冰，脂肪質便跟水份分離了開來，上面浮着脂肪粒，下面却稀淡得像水。所以第一種辦法不好。若論後一種方法，冰塊是水凝成的，咖啡加冰塊，等於　入大量的冰水，濃郁的咖啡味兒便淡了，也不好。</p>
<p>最科學化的方法是：先將咖啡加　地煮好（原來用一匙煮一杯的，就得用一匙半·）傾入冰箱裏凍成小小的立方冰咖啡塊·要喝的時候，祇須取出數方塊，放入一杯熱咖啡中。你就立刻有了一杯又濃又冷的冰咖啡！</p>
<h3 id="c91">黃綠色太陽眼鏡　對人類眼睛最有裨益 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 家南</p>
<p>據紐約大學眼科副敎授　　博士說：最好的太陽眼鏡，必須能够吸收紫外光綫和熱綫，而對於一般彩色光綫，則必須能够部份而平均地予以吸收，因此自然界色調的比例，不致因戴太陽眼鏡而起變化。根擄實騐的結果，黃綠色的太陽眼鏡對於眼睛最有益處，而爲科學家向大衆所推薦。</p>
<p>同時，除了色澤之外，鏡片也必須按照科學原理細心加以琢磨過。至於戴太陽眼鏡的時尚，應限於在日光熾列的情形之下。在平常的時候，多戴不惟無益，反而有害的。</p>
<p>一雙眼睛是人類身上的至寶，它的構浩是極精細而需要特別保護的。在這火傘高張的夏天，仕女們在選購太陽眼鏡的時候，必須分外注意才是。</p>

<p>— 陸英</p>
<p>夏天最普遍的冷飲當然是冰淇淋，眞是沁人脾胃的一服淸凉劑。可是偏有「火烙冰淇淋」之發明，你也曾聽到過麽？「火烙冰淇淋」的製法是這樣的：取一塊蛋糕，在上面塗滿欲淇淋，約半英寸厚。再四週浸透打和了的鷄蛋白。這樣，便可以放進烙爐內去烘焙了。烘了五分鐘左右，取出來，便是一客「火烙冰淇淋」。因爲有蛋白的隔離，保證裏在夾　裏的Ice　Crean，絕不融化。</p>
<h3 id="c93">浮瓜沉李時節　縱談西瓜 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 北海</p>
<p>天熱了，西瓜也上市了。街頭的小販們一而擦汗，一面揮着浦扇趕蒼蠅，一面邊聲嘶力竭地呌着「一百塊洋錢買一塊來」！弄堂裏也川流不息地有西瓜販子每天在後門邊兜生意。馬路兩旁，一大羣一大羣的蒼蠅嗡嗡不絕地在西瓜皮上轉來轉去。知了聲喧，正是浮瓜沉李的季節。</p>
<p>今年，上海人大概要在西瓜上用掉多少錢呢？說出來，你也許不大相信——據業中人最低的估計，是六十萬萬元！其中單是平湖瓜，大槪就要値到三十萬萬。</p>
<p>頭藤瓜　品質不佳</p>
<p>初夏是瓜果繁殖的時候，不料今年霪雨連綿，影響了它的長成，所以今夏頭藤西瓜，雖已上市，而不及往年產量之多和品質之佳。又因人工運費的昂貴，所以每擔售格已至四萬元左右，最普通的亦需二萬餘元。好在上海有的是豪客，每天從四郊運滬的西瓜都能掃數售罄</p>
<p>至於在滬傾銷的西瓜，每年佔數最多的要算平湖瓜了。據今年最低估訂，約値卅億元以上，以前平湖地方所種値的呌做「三白瓜」——就是皮白，瓤白，子白，也呌做「雪瓤西瓜」，不過，到現時「三白瓜」已經落伍，代之而起的是「馬鈴瓜」。據說這瓜種是由塘樓傳過去的。最好的平湖西瓜，是出產在南門外，可說隻隻是甜甜蜜蜜的。</p>
<p>看皮色　鑑別生熟</p>
<p>俗語說得好，「買瓜看皮色」。其實「買瓜看皮色」只能鑑別它的生熟而已，大凡西瓜到成熟時它的皮色呈烏綠，花紋淸晰，底皮色黃，如果瓜皮靑綠，底而色白，那就是尚未成熟的表示。瓜皮之厚薄，亦可在瓜皮光滑與否上鑑定。因此，從種瓜的農夫起，一直到水果行販戶，他們都是靠皮色來評定它的身價。</p>
<p>瓜販子　大賺一票</p>
<p>擄說有一種專門看皮色的販戶，每年在瓜市裏，着實可以勝一票。他們唯一的本領，就是經他們揀選後的西瓜十分之七八可以保證它成熟得恰到好處，因爲過份成孰的西瓜反而要變成倒　，然而這種經過揀選後的西瓜價値，也較市價要高出一半，這高出的代價，就是他們由經騐換來的酬報。但是欲來眞正甜西瓜，還須注意它的出身所在地，否則還是不可靠。</p>
<p>二藤瓜　開始上市</p>
<p>頭藤西瓜，旣受雨水影響，甜味不够，且容易腐爛，然而二藤瓜已開始上市了。所以要吃好瓜，只須等待二三天。上海除平湖西瓜外，還有三林塘出產的浜瓜也很負盛名。其次是浦東大團和崇明的西瓜了。此外，還有從京滬滬杭沿綫運滬銷售的也不少，不過，他們都列入了雜瓜類，而大部份在北市塲出售。據南北兩市塲估計：本年的西瓜銷售總値可達六十億元。</p>
<p>哈密瓜　瓜中極品</p>
<p>在國內稱得上極品的西瓜，是產在新疆哈密，與山東的德州，至於台灣瓜却僅是徒負虛表。至於國外美國南部所產的西瓜偌大無比，重達三十斤以上，惟甜味總不若我國哈密瓜之美。</p>
<p>盛暑吃西瓜，非但能袪暑，而且使孩子們可以减少瘡癤的發生。應當注意的是：切不可和油膩的菜食同吃。此外，西瓜對火蒸傷寒的治療也有很大的帮助。因此，每年西瓜上市時，也有水果商人特地將它冷藏到冬天才出賣的。</p>

<p>— 君默</p>
<p>戰爭結束以後，邁亞米海濱今夏又已恢復了它人山人海歌舞昇平的景象。事實上，在邁亞米城五十年的歷史上，從未有如今年夏天的那麼熱鬧過。鈔票滿天飛，誰也不知道那兒來的這麼多錢，大槪是四年的戰爭已造就了不少的暴發戶吧，這批人對於化錢似乎完全不當一回事。五塊美金吃一頓飯，一千美金的支票只能用來付付一百美金一星期的房錢。汽車夫一個禮拜有兩三百元的小費進賬，領帶有賣到一千五百美金一條的。</p>
<p>大略說起來，這鈔票的洪流共有四個去處：住宿，百貨公司，吃喝，賭博。說到住宿，邁亞米今日已絕找不到容身之地了，你要想在旅館客廳的椅子上打一個盹，也要出大價錢，而且還得看你有沒有路數。因爲今年，成羣結隊的遊客搭了汽車，火車，飛機，源源擁來，已超過了邁亞米原來人口二十五萬的一倍。雖然，旅館房間規定每天不得超過美金三十七元七角，但事實上早已漲到了六十元。房間完後，許多人只好租張長凳睡，或者去租屋頂上的　台。</p>
<p>物價統制局在旁邊着得眞是目瞪口呆。</p>
<p>兩位女郎在人家地板上借睡一夜，租金十五元。</p>
<p>又有個人在人家後院堆柴間裏借睡一夜，租金十六元。</p>
<p>有空房間的人家漫天索價，爲的是不想租出去。</p>
<p>但結果人家却立刻就要，不還一個錢價。</p>
<p>邁亞米導報議諷地說，幸虧邁亞米法律規定，不得在厠所裏過夜，否則，房東如果把厠所租給人住，一千美金一季，包管大家都來搶。</p>
<p>到邁亞米來的遊客，玩過幾個通宵之後，說：棕櫚樹下的邁亞米之夜，眞個是夜夜元宵。在那裏的一百五十家夜總會裏，人每晚都擠滿，從沒個人抱怨過一聲價錢太高。</p>
<p>錢當初來得容易，這回去得也容易。賭桌上骰子一擲，一兩萬美金流進了別人的口袋。人家眉毛也不抬一抬，沒有人把這放在心上。</p>

<p>— 錫壽</p>
<p>薄暮時分，我常常走上那個山頭，悲哀地坐在一棵老橡樹蔭下。我底視綫隨便投在山下的平原上，看見那裏的景色在變換着</p>
<p>在附近的沙納河蜿蜓地流動，波濤澎湃，泡沫晶瑩；它一直流向遼遠的昏暗中去。山脚下的那個湖，却是靜止不動，一潭睡眠着的水。太白星已在湖上面的藍空出現。</p>
<p>那些蓋着深綠色樹木的山頭，沉垂的太陽還向它們投射一道最後的光輝。於是，月亮昇了起來，照白了天際。</p>
<p>這時，我底視綫忽又投在那個峨特式的塔尖上，從敎堂裏溢出的宗敎的聲音散播在空中。我停住了步，傾聽那粗野的鐘，混在合奏的聖歌裏，敲着白晝的最後幾響。</p>
<p>可是在這些溫柔的景緻前，我底　魂却漠然無情，旣不感到誘惑，也不怎樣熱狂。我俯視那大地，宛如一個飄泊無定的影子。活潑的太陽不再能溫暖那些死人。</p>
<p>我徒然地望着一個一個山邱，自南至北，自東至西，凡是這個廣大無限的幅員裏所有的方向，我底月光完全巡行到，我只有如此說：「沒有一個地方幸福在等我！」</p>
<p>誘惑早已在我身邊飛逝，那些小谷，那些大厦，那些茅屋、與我有何關係？在我看來，不渦是些空虛的東西。河呀，岩石呀，樹林呀，都是荒野裏的可貴東西，可是你們缺了一個人，什麼都變得沒有生氣了！</p>
<h3 id="c97">各各他的伊甸 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>見到夏夜的繁星，我總會記起一個可愛的地方。</p>
<p>一位先生曾給那個地方題了一個古怪的名字：「各各他的伊甸」，我笑着問他什麼解釋，他答道：</p>
<p>「各各他是耶穌釘十字架的地方，猶太人稱之爲骷髏地，即苦難地，伊甸園是上帝給始祖亞當夏娃造的花園，是個無憂無慮的極樂世界。好吧「各各他的伊甸」，這是什麼意思，你該知道了吧？」</p>
<p>「那位先生好像姓張，也許不姓張，我已有些模糊了。但是我還淸楚地記得，他向我說這話的時候，是睡在一張充滿藥水氣味的白鐵床上，床邊有一張茶几，上面放着一瓶鮮花，二個藥罐，一根熱度表，一隻茶杯，和一個喝開水用的玻璃彎管。</p>
<p>一間寂寞的病房，就是那位先生的「伊甸」嗎？</p>
<p>自然還不止於此。</p>
<p>在這個病房隔壁，另一間小小的病房裏，另一張充滿藥水氣味的白鐵床上，睡着一位美麗的小姐。我不知道她姓甚名誰，也不知道她來自何方，因爲她很沉默，又很神秘。可是我看出她的病勢十分沉重，至少要比我的病重十倍吧？她不能像我一樣起床行走玩要，她咳嗽，發熱，還不時低低的喚着「姆媽」。</p>
<p>然而每天到了夜裏，幽靜美麗的夏天的夜裏，我常常聽見那位小姐在輕輕地笑着。</p>
<p>有意還是無意，我自己也說不出，總之，每到黃昏時刻，我的脚總是會不由自主地踱到張先生和那位小姐的房外，那裏有一個很大的陽台，我靠在一排水門汀攔杆上，仰望着滿天閃爍的繁星，靜聽着他們的談話·</p>
<p>「你今天好嗎？牛奶有否喝完？」是張先生的聲音·</p>
<p>「今天好些，只是牛奶仍舊吃不進。」那位小姐輕輕地答·</p>
<p>「你又不聽我的話了，你不乖！」</p>
<p>那位小姐不再作答，却低低的笑了，啊！是何等嬌弱的笑聲！「她在撒嬌吧，」我這樣想。「他們在戀愛吧？」我又這樣想·於是第二天，我走到張先生房裏，頑皮地打趣他：「你又不聽我的話，你不乖！」</p>
<p>張先生笑了·是苦笑？不！是眞心的歡笑。「別打趣人，你應該爲我高興！」有一次他這樣向我說。</p>
<p>是的，我應該爲他高興·但是我不能忘記，他是男人，那位小姐是女人。男人和女人要好，這是戀愛。戀愛是什麽？戀愛豈不是一架美麗的梯子，從這架梯子登上去，唯一正當的結局，就是結婚和生男育女。而他們，一對命在旦夕的病人，竟也在要好，也在談戀愛，這未免太無聊了！難道他們也在想結婚和生男育女嗎？</p>
<p>我的心中豎着一堵堅厚的高牆，這堵高牆裏面，雖未砌着什麽牢不可破的舊禮敎的巨石，然而我不能否認，無數微小的傳統的見地，無數不自覺的純物質的利害觀念，如一堆堅韌的泥沙，築成了這堵牆壁，擋住我對於這對可憐的男女的同情和諒解，直到有一天，極其偶然的有一天。</p>
<p>那一天張先生的精神似乎特別良好，他穿着一件藍條紋毛巾絨睡衣，斜靠在床上，手裏捏着一個白色的小信封，兩眼望着房門在等待什麽人走過，看見我，他就喊住了我：</p>
<p>「謝謝你，給我做一件事，好嗎？」</p>
<p>我嗤的笑了：「請我做紅娘嗎？當然可以！不過什麽時候請我吃喜酒？」</p>
<p>聽了這話，他笑了，但是這一次，我看得非常淸楚，他是在苦笑，極難堪的苦笑。</p>
<p>「爲什麽用這樣的話來笑我們？」他開始靜靜地向我說着：「你以爲我們已忘記掉自己在什麽地方嗎？你以爲我們還在做着塵世的空夢嗎？唉！你爲什麽不伸手來摸摸我們作痛的胸口？爲什麼不看看我們背上這具沉重的十字架？……」</p>
<p>他喘了二口氣，又接下去：</p>
<p>「不過，我也並不認爲我們的舉動是完全無聊。這世界原是什麽呢？到底什麽是眞，什麽是假，什麽是有意思，什麽是無意思呢？吿訴你吧，沒有患病的時候，整天忙忙碌碌，我是從沒有想到過這些事。但是自從背上了這具沉重的十字架，我就覺得：雖是凡人，但我爲什麽不能像基督一樣，在可怕的各各他山頂，在天昏地黑的一剎那，依舊可以用溫柔的聲音給一個同難的朋友一些安慰說：『今天我要和你一同住在樂園裏了！』我和她的關係，就是本着這一點願望。我的願望，我已吿訴過你，就是在苦難中尋找樂園，就是我所謂的『各各他的伊甸』。當然這也並不限於小小的男女關係。」</p>
<p>他說完了，吃力地望着我。我很奇怪，一位相識不久的先生，怎麼會向我說這麽一番話。可是我了解他，我同情他，我就給他把信送到隔壁那位美麗的小姐手裏。同時我問了那位小姐的姓名，知道她姓梅，名字呌麗芳。</p>
<p>張先生和梅麗芳小姐死在三星期後的同一個夜裏，相隔僅一小時，</p>
<p>當他們的屍體被潔白的被單包裹着抬出病房時，滿天夏夜的星星，那麼美麗而明亮，我就站在純潔的星光下，默默地爲他們祝福。……</p>
<p>以上不是寫小說，也不是講故事，乃是叙述六年前，我在某醫院中見到的一件眞實的事。</p>
<p>現在我要吿訴你爲什麽叙述這件事的原因。</p>
<p>這是因爲不久以前，我發表了一篇小說，那篇小說裏的情節，有些和上面這件事相似·於是一位朋友寫信來向我說了，他說這種動亂的大時代裏，小說家應該做一個勇敢的戰士，展開偉大的塲面，吹起雄壯的號筒！不應該扭扭捏捏，再縮在狹小的角落裏，描寫一些凄哀無意思的男女之事。</p>
<p>雖然我非小說家，但我不能不感謝那位朋友的指示。不過我也願意吿訴那位朋友：動亂的大時代裏多的是勇敢的壯士，然而更多的是掙扎在飢餓疾患之中，逼近死亡的人們！他們捎着沉重的十字架，流落在可怕的各各他山頂，痛苦，絕望，幸福遺忘了他們，世界遺忘了他們；但是我不能遺忘他們，因爲我自己也是他們中的一員。因此我明知道我的文字會見　於勇敢的壯士，但希望不致見棄於一羣可憐的難友們，並希望他們能明白我的宗旨，也可說我的願望，就是那位張先生所說：要在苦難中尋找樂園！要建造「各各他的伊甸！」當然這是不限於小小的男女關係。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>巧的很，劉子雲的故鄉就是武漢，於是她也借詞逃難，辭去了女學校的職務，決定和麗華一道走。</p>
<p>關於劉子雲同赴武漢的事，墨太太和張弦又都不加反對了，原因是他們知道劉子雲在武漢是名家之後，地方上有着相當的勢力，他們爲了想利用劉子雲打通這個新環境的關係，所以願意和她同路。再者，他們知道董劭凌並不到武漢去，沒有董劭凌，他們便少了許多顧慮。因此越發地歡迎劉子雲同路。他們對於劉子雲的看法是：只要董劭凌不在旁邊，任劉子雲如何接近麗華，總是不足威脅他們的。因爲劉子雲究竟是女人，女人喜歡女人，是沒有什麼危險的。</p>
<p>麗華爲了和董劭凌的分別，深深感到一種嚴重的痛苦！雖然，劉子雲勸慰她：董劭凌不久總會到武漢去，暫時的離開不必放在心裏。但麗華總不免隱隱地難過！她想到：爲了兩三天不見面，她都覺得像失掉什麽似的空虛，如今將要許多日子，甚而幾個月不見面了，她不是更要空虛嗎？因此，她的心靈開始感受着一種新的難堪的煩憂！她的精神也開始陷入一種恍惚的，迷茫情緒中！</p>
<p>離別的前夕，麗華背了墨太太；背了張弦；背了麗雲；背了劉子雲；鼓着勇氣一個人悄悄地，跑到女學校；找到了董劭凌的宿舍；佇立房門，不喊叫；也不走進；心潮在黑暗的沉默裏，起伏着羞澀；怯懼；焦灼不安的種種澎湃！許久許久，她才慢慢拔步趨前。</p>

<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>前兩月商務印書館發行一本朱寳賢君譯述的「二十世紀的問題」。是Lord　Davies氏在國際聯盟成立後十年著的，距今已七八年了，批評底對象似乎已成過去·然而書中所討論的「怎樣消減戰爭底原因」，確是二十世紀一個最嚴重而迫切的大問題；這問題可說至今還沒有解決，還需要人們努力去解決；這本書却提出了科學的具體方案，對於這問題底解決確大有帮助；還是値得我們仔細一談·現在先把這書內容簡單摘要地介紹一下，然後把我對這問題底意見附帶說一　。</p>
<p>避免戰爭</p>
<p>這書共二十一章，首先說明「避免戰爭，須賴國聯主特公道；軍縮不成功，沒法實施公道；軍縮成功，須賴安全保障底確立；因主張非「因科學方法組織國際警察」不可。證之以希臘城邑聯盟底歷史，蘇利聖彼得諸人底大同計劃，這種組織。不但是應當做，而且是可以做得到的。可惜當時起草國聯大憲章的先生們，大都爲「國家主權」，「自衛絕對權」，「競勝的天性」等傳統觀念所牽制；只根據「赫斯與密勒草案一敷衍塞責，把法國代表波爾喬組織國際警察底提案，完全否決。連組織永久機關來討論這類問題底提議，也全不接受。於是國聨遂成為一種空空洞洞的討論會，雖有國際法庭，仲裁院，而行政院毫無實力執行其判決或裁定。於是國際仍然毫無安全保障，不但不能裁軍，而且軍備的競賽比之一九一四年以前更加猛烈。次遂駁斥絕對「國家主權」，及「自衛絕對權」，兩說之謬誤·認爲國家主權與自衛權在國際只是相對的，而非絕對的。國與國競勝，也應和國內各種競賽一樣，須受規律底限制，否則將引導自身入於毁滅之途。次又引申好勃司之「契約說」來解釋國際關係，先修改國聯盟約，使國聯成爲一種雛形的邦聯。行政院改由五大國或七大國會同四小國代表組織委員會主持；行使國際警察管制種，使成爲公道底公僕，及國際社會底保護者。以運用國內私法底方式，來運用國際公法；國際將變成法律統治局面，武力只用於維護公道，懲罰違約國或侵略國，多餘的武力自不待裁而自裁了。</p>
<p>國際警察軍</p>
<p>國際警察軍底組織，係根據「武器分配原則」。並分做兩期進行，第一期爲試騐期二十五年·在此期欲退會者，須於三年前通知。凡　會員國底軍隊，皆分成三類：（一）「市警察軍」，配置木棍，刀劍，手鎗，（二）「國家警察軍」，配置一九一四年以前的步鎗，機關鎗，大砲，及舊式軍艦，使　維持國內治安底責任。（三）「國際警察軍」除臨時徵用會員國國家警察軍外，並另組「國際特務部隊」，配置一九一四年以後新發明的飛機，潛艇，毒氣，坦克車；並且約定以後各會員國新發明的武器，皆須呈報歸國際特務部隊使用，遠者重辦；務使國際警察軍享有武器之優越性。武器除飛機自製外，餘皆向會員國定購或租借。士兵官佐亦跟着租借向會員國借調。惟總指揮及海陸空軍與毒氣四組指揮，由各火國推選，輪流担任，共同組織參謀部，平日與各會員國參謀部保持密切聯絡。平時經費由會員按照繳納國聯底歲費比例分担，戰時則一切取之於違約國或侵略國。大本營駐於巴勒斯坦，大陸站及分站軍隊根據地。則在委任統治地，中立區域，軍事重要地點，以及各小國四種地械內選擇租借。至試騐期滿，第二期之武器完全自製，士兵官佐亦完全自行召募委任·其駐地維持費之攤派，則仍照舊辦理。在此期內，會員國欲退會須通知十年後始生效。</p>
<p>這種辦法，雖不能廢除戰爭，總算把戰爭底性質改變了。雖不能即行裁軍，軍備底競賽，總算停止而可望日趨於栽減。雖在組織的技術方面有些過於遝就國家主義，不免流弊，尚須留待專家討論；然而已將絕對主權底觀念，改爲較優的；自衛絕對權底觀念，改爲互助的；競勝觀念，改爲合作精神；在心理上總算得了一大進步。倘使當年國聯採用這個計劃，第二次大戰或許不會發生。現在第二次大戰後又設立聯合國，附設各會員國參謀長會議，討論國際警察這一類問題；在野名流像愛因斯坦一般人，也在大聲疾呼的主張。倘使這個辦法被聯合國斟酌採納，所謂二十世紀的問題雖不能說完全解決，總算有了解決的途徑。</p>
<p>當前的局勢</p>
<p>但是照現在彼此不相信任的國際情形看來，這個辦法行得通嗎？我却不能無疑。</p>
<p>第一：「契約說」原是公法學者及民權論者一種假定，在歷史上毫無根據。據社會學底啓示，人民之交出自衛權由社會代他行使，原由當時所謂主權者——酋長或君主——爲保持領土內底治安秩序，强迫交出來的，實非出於自願。後來演進成爲司法制度，中世紀末有些學者爲鼓吹民權及人道主義，乃杜撰契約說來解釋此種現象。然而支配人類行爲的，經驗總超過理論。現今國際，仍然是無政府狀態，誰是新主權者？誰又敢以王權者自任？誰能强迫誰交出自衛權，誰又肯在無確實安全保障之前，自動交出自衛權？</p>
<p>第二：考諸現在各聯邦或邦聯底成立經過，都有特殊的歷史背景。古時希臘聯盟，是由雅典斯巴達迭爲盟主；近代如瑞士合衆國，是由於聯合抵抗敵國；如蘇聯德意志是由一個强有力的邦來推動，如不列顚聯合王國，更是由於帝國演變而來；總而言之，不是由於外來的逼迫，便是由於內部的逼迫。現今國際誰是逼迫者？雖說下次如再大戰，人類文明必遭毁滅，可以逼迫各國和平團結。却是人類底行動，總是情感重於理智，總是可與共患難，難與共安樂；不須遠徽古史，只要看看眼前底美蘇，便是一個榜樣。以前携手抵抗軸心國，何等恩愛，她們都嘗過第二次大戰的痛苦，比第一次更兇；如果有第三次底話，加了原子炸彈，當比第二次更兇得多；論理應該團結。然而一旦停戰，便爭持不肯相下，好像忘記了過去，並不顧及將來；又好像因爲顧及將來，所以爭得更厲害。有人說這是民主主義與社會主義爭霸，恐怕這還是表面的標榜，骨子裏恐怕還是那「競勝的衝動」在那裏作祟吧：像這樣怎能組成邦聯？即使勉强組成，沒有一個能够做推動的中心，也是無濟於事，就如過去的國聯，是以英法爲中心，英法不能合作，遂使國聯坍台，惹起第二次大戰·這短短二十餘年底歷史，我想大家是記得的。古人說：「一池不兩蛟，一棲不兩雄，」不料這話到而今還用得着。人類的進步眞可憐！</p>
<p>第三：軍事科學進步，一日千里，新武器發明無窮，一個國際權力機關，如何能始終維持武器的優越性？據報美國現又發明了「病菌戰爭」，一盎司底肉毒素，可以毒殺二萬萬人。成本只及原子炸彈四十分之一，效力却高出原子炸彈千倍以上，什麽毒氣更趕不上牠，製造用不着大工廠，只須一間實騐室，或蒸溜室，便足了事。現今國際盟約是毫無信用的，假使其中有一國懐抱野心，或不滿於這「大上國家，」「最高武力，只繳出國際所已知的新武器，而把病菌這一類的新發明保守秘密，留待自用。試問有何方法遏止？嚴密檢査嗎？又恐干涉太過，容易發生裂痕。何况不容易檢査，試問國際警察軍有何方法始終保特優勢</p>
<p>是心理問題</p>
<p>我提出這些疑問，不是悲觀，是想提起大家更深一層的注意，所謂「二十世紀的問題是心理問題」，不是專靠組織什麼强力所能成功的。組織固可影響心理，但改善心理，究竟是解決這問題底先決條件。歐洲文化，自希臘以來，多得力於分析鬥爭。及達爾文那般人發明生存競爭底進化定律以後，更把生物界底「原野法則」，採用到人類社會生活各方面，什麼事情都拿鬥爭精神來幹，鬥爭的名目，層出不窮，甚至講世界主義的宗敎團體也鬥爭。雖有克魯泡特余等提倡「互助說」來挽救這種狂瀾；然而他們造成底環境，總使他們覺得互助只可對內，對外仍非鬥爭不可。殊不知現在交通工具發達，已使世界發展成爲大而無外的整體。有一部份人士，也曉得世界整體，和平不可分割，便想拿暴力來征服全世界·照孟子所說「天下定於一」底道理來講，也未嘗無理由，可是還要曉得，孟子說過「不嗜殺人能」之」又說「以德服人者王以力假仁者霸」：以力服人，不如以德服人，以力服人，縱令不蹈希特勒底覆轍，也不過霸而已，何不更進一步，求爲天下歸往的王呢？別說人與其他生物一樣！人究竟不同於禽獸：有理智，有道德，是有法在這大而無外的圈子裏謀共存共榮的。其法維何，即是努力宣傳中國儒家所講的「忠恕之道」，改正歐美人士傳統的人生觀｛由「已所不欲，勿施於人」·做到「以大事小的樂天者」。所謂二十世紀的問題自不成爲問題；即有問題，也不難迎刃而解·現在聯合國附設科學敎育文化委員會，也似乎有見於國際敎育底重要·可是照他們底宣言章程看，只計劃到文化交流，文化合作，還沒有找着合乎時代需要的指導原理，來做他們底中心工作；這一點還希望大家注意。</p>

<p>— 周平</p>
<p>自由論壇報出版第七期英文本的中國年鑑，業已出版，內容包括民國三十三年和三十四年全部中國的大事。「年鑑」，顧名思義是每年出版一次，但昭編者的聲明，一則因爲紙張的缺乏，二則由於戰時搜集統計的資料不易，所以祇得兩年併成一本出版。主編是曹文彥，顧問錢　書，執筆者係各部門的　家或首長。內容分八部：（一）通論，其間講到中國的地理·天文·人口·氣候·歷史·哲學·文學和語言；（二）政黨與政治，其間有孫科申述中山先生政治哲學，潘公展說明國民黨與國民政府　狀，邵力子報吿參政會的經過；（三）國民政府的組織，其間包括行政·立法·司法·監察·考試各院兼及內政，蒙藏，僑民的事業；（四）軍事，其　有陳誠討諭軍政，周至柔說明中國空軍，以及中國各戰塲的情况，最後說到日本無條件的投降和中國的受降的情形；（五）中國與世界之關係，其間說明各種的國際會議和中國的外交情形；（六）金融與經濟，其間談到中國的財政·銀行·貨幣，對外貿易，國內工業發展，農林·水利·交通·糧食等等問題；（七）文化與社會工作，其間談到敎育·研究·出版·宗敎和各種的教濟事業；（八）兩年來的大事記。</p>
<p>全書共一一六四頁，這樣一本大書在戰時中國還能出版，這確是一個奇蹟，也正表示國家對於文化事業的重視。本書印刷裝訂都很精良，有幾篇文字也寫得很優美。從這本書裏面可以看到戰時中國的進展情形，也可以說是一部很完備的近兩年的中國史料。不過有三點我們還願意提出　和主編商榷的。第一，我們覺得有些文章略嫌公式化一點，似乎官樣文章，不够深入民間，　說親近。第二，全書比較注種平面的敘述而未能充分說明中國在這兩年來在各方面發展的情形，例如書中談到國的哲學和文學便根本沒有說到近兩年來有些甚麽變化，又如近兩年政治的動態，也沒有淸晰詳盡的說明。我們以為從申述近年來發展情形看起來，祗有第六部門關於金融經濟發展各章比較能够使人滿意。第三，我們以為本書還有各點遺漏的地方，例如各黨各派的主義內容，活動姿態可說沒有提到，文化運動不够刻劃清楚，宗教事業方面回教和佛教隻字未提·我們希望编者在编辑第八期時對於上述三點加以注意·</p>

<p>一個鄉下小孩子到上海來，南京路兜了一個圈子，回來嚷頭痛，躺上床足足睡了一天才回復常態。大人其實也有點難以支持，不過受刺激的抗拒力不同而已。</p>
<p>我往往看到一個在都市生長的孩子，他一個人有時坐在那裏出神，不知他想的什麽事，他的年齡不過十歲左右，一種早熟的如有所思情狀，不知該高興抑或悲愁？</p>
<p>現在人腦子的負担，夠稱苦重了，而科學上似乎也無法檢騐一根腦神經該管理些什麽事，腦髓又能收藏些什麽……</p>
<p>且舉個小問題，你親愛的讀者，你曾否統計過你的腦子中記過多少數字，如果你一一筆錄下來，不夠使你大吃一驚嗎？比如住處的門牌，電話號碼，襯衫尺寸，薪水數目，家年紀，生辰，報紙張數，友朋酬應約會，支票號碼，債務往來，……無一不是數字，而且這些數字是隨你的社會關係日漸增加的。</p>
<p>單是數字一項，夠使一個人頭昏腦花了。我曾經試問過好幾個朋友，（我自己也在內）目前的主要幾種郵資債目，比如快信，掛號，航空，國內外，結果，沒有一個能回答得出來。</p>
<p>數字不僅逐漸增多，而且日日在變化。米價，人人切身所關的了。這一個月來的漲落，就使我們耗費了不少腦細胞，還別談什麽烚赤哪美鈔哪！</p>
<p>數字不算的，天呀！還有無數的「事」哩！這些事又並不如數字那樣的有形，機械，可以單純地記憶，你說，現代人，生活在都市裏的現代人，壽命能長嗎？</p>
<p>起先我真不明白各種補藥補品，為何在都市裏特別流行，而記憶衰退，失眠，又爲什麽如是普遍，原來都市人太肯傷腦筋了，某個電台幾點到幾點失眠節目，某家電影院日場幾點，夜場幾點，都能如數家珍，怎能再怪腦子不爭氣呢？</p>

<p>最近蘇北共軍，大舉進攻，除增加主力軍外，還向各鄉強拉人民，充前鋒，當炮灰，各鄉壯丁，紛紛逃難。有一位黨人強拉一個農民。</p>
<p>農民說：「我五十二歲了，還能免麼？」</p>
<p>「你身體還算強壯，代我們挑東西罷！」</p>
<p>「跳不動，走不遠，倣我罷！」</p>
<p>「拿末不能挑東西，同去進攻，壯壯聲勢也好，在戰場上多一個人，敵人看起來，就多看見一個黑點兒」。</p>
<p>這個黨人總算天真，沒有利用他們欺騙的慣拔，直截了當就把那農人拉去做小黑點兒。當然拉去的小黑點兒並不是那半老農人一個，其他還有許許多多的黑點兒。這些黑點兒代替共黨犧牲了。</p>
<p>蘇北較有資產的人，因有財，就有罪，他們是「畏罪潛逃」了；沒有資產的壯年人，怕做戰場的小黑點兒，也不得不逃亡，所以江南遍地難民！</p>
<p>一個大地主為着想保全家産，就向共黨獻殷勤。縣級黨人明知他是假意，但認為可作宣傳資料，於是譽之為「開明紳士」，委他做參政員，給他一點小便利。中級人士却側目而視，時時說「大地主」開他的心。他到鄉下收租，鄉級幹部就包圍他，侮辱他，有時要捆他下長江；當他稟告縣級黨人時，他們會給他一些安慰，有時代他向鄉級說情，解決了一些小問題。現在共黨　窮七見，對於這些人，不再敷衍，大地主的田分光了，他不得不逃亡，不逃亡說不定真要送他下長江，見海龍王。</p>
<p>國共談判拖了多時，共方在蘇北盡力搜括壓迫，人民固苦痛萬分，但是共黨的惡相，同時也暴露了不少，從前我們把解放區的怪現象　蘇南人士談說時，一般人總以為我們在說神話，現在該明白了。唉！誰不愛家鄉，千千萬萬的難民，何必逃亡？世上不會有這樣多的獃子，沒有吃盡了苦，絕不會逃亡做難民的！</p>

<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>記得我們避寇安徽南屏山村的時期，我因苦念亡兒榕，曾填了一首點綘　詞：「窈窕靈　，春來緣遍空山路，谷中雲護。有我亡兒墓。　地下孤眠，寂寞和誰語？休　怖！種些梅樹。好伴兒同住。」我想起了這首詞，就又想到了「入土為安」的一句老話，二七時和葆妹們一商量，也以為在七期內安葬的好，讓你去和亡兒作伴，彼此都不寂寞；所以先期託殯儀館執事把你的靈柩運往　山下的　谷公墓去，一面又和主持公墓的將仲川　陳渭隱二先生接洽定妥；到了二十九日下午前七時，我就同着葆妹世京和錚兒梅兒一行五人，搭船往靈　營葬去了。這天忽又下起雨來，一起了我無窮的悲惑。所幸蓉兒的墤雖經大刦，依然無恙，墓碑也依然兀立着，正面嵌着童子軍裝的遺像，虎虎有生氣，面背而　　虎先生的銘文也了了可誦。好在你的墓穴先已掘就，手續很為簡單，趁着雨點暫住的當兒，就把你葬了下去，葆妹和梅兒的一片哭聲，恰與土工們鏟鋤之聲相應和，一聲聲的打在我的心上，也像泥土般一塊塊碎了。唉，風呀風！從此以後，蓉兒托庇在你的愛護之下，不會鷩怖；而你有了這孩子承歡膝前，夜　也定然不感枯寂，可是我自從失去了你，踽踽涼涼的影隻形單，這損失時無可補償的！</p>
<p>你的喪訊傳佈之後，上海的親友們十分驚悼，紛紛的來函唁慰，并賜厚　，都勸我要付之達觀，善自排遣，　意　兄的「生生死雖殊，情躺親猶一，」兩句，最使我得到了安慰；知道我愛，水無窮期的。前輩　　叔先生曾經斷絃三次，是個過來人，特地撰賜挽聯一副：「故園與　思，隨夫子歸隱與門，願卜變棲直到老。」「秋夢　歐波，讀元　悲吟諸什，感曾同病更相憐。」同病相憐，自可使我減少一些悲哀；文友毛羽滿兄也賜下了輓詩一軸，是七律二音：「紫蘭花謝柳　眉，白石清泉小劫移；銀燭影　悲　掛，珠　香　誦遺詩；蛾成忽破同宮　，鳳去空　向日枝；　罷楞　倍惆悵，人間天上總情　。「殘書堆積惹深悲，　下丈人說摕眉；楮葉蓮花通妙法，緣窗紅課訂新詞。拔釵風致垂彤管，舉案　音洽　絲；悟到人天原一氣，六如泡幻不堪持。」典雅哀艶，自是絕妙好詞；　可是把你比做才女，你是愧不敢當的，如果說你是個典型的良妻賢母，那麼你可當之無愧咧。</p>

<p>對於現實發生不滿，於是就憧憬着渺茫的東西。這是人的常情。所以有許多喜歡高談政治，沒有嚐過共黨滋味的人，對共方就發生了好感。但是我們蘇北有許多地方已經是在延安統治下過了七年，七年來眼淚也流乾了，我希望民主同盟的人，以平民身份，悄悄地來到蘇北再住上幾天，看看怎樣？會不會和受難的同胞抱頭痛哭！</p>
<p>有人說共黨不是黨，是教，我們七年來的體騐，覺得這話千真萬確。黨人的談論，行事，待人，接物，都和教徒一樣，老是那麼一套，進去了就沒有理智，只盲目跟着黨的命令走。</p>
<p>共黨黨員都是十分尖銳化的人，組織力強，做事澈底，這一點是他們動人的地方。他們有這樣的勢力，也是靠着這些本領。　官僚做事只做了六成七成，就算有交代，他們做起來不是十二成，就是廿四成，所以人民吃苦也吃到了十二成。</p>
<p>尖銳化的人做事太熱心了，老百姓嘴里吃的說的，一切的一切，他們總會注意，不合他們的意旨時，就有危險，所以解放區裏的人民，總覺時時刻刻受着人的監視，隨時隨地有發生危險的可能，於是不能不逃亡。</p>
<p>有人說：「共黨黨人的字典裏沒有「誠」字，祗有「偽」字，沒有「愛」字，祗有「恨」字。「民主」在他們嘴裏，「專制」在他們的心頭。」我們七年來的觀察，覺得這些話一點都不錯。</p>
<p>他們也沒有法律，也號稱三審制，但是法庭是從來不大開審的，一切事情有鄉區幹部辦理。下級幹部心目中祗有成見，沒有法理，比較窮的人，永遠是勝利的。殘破的農村，那裏來資產階級，一個勤苦耕種略有積蓄的人，往往被無業貧民想出花樣來橋咋，現在勤苦的人都不高興出力種地了，收成多了，就有人注目，就會受氣，就有危險性。</p>

He specifically mentioned that after the "September 18th" Incident and on the eve of the full-scale War of Resistance, when China was facing internal turmoil and external aggression simultaneously, at a critical juncture of survival and extinction, the nation gathered outstanding military and political cadres from across the country to review the revolutionary situation, discuss major domestic and foreign policies, strengthen resolve, cultivate spirit, strive for self-improvement, prepare for a final showdown against false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, thereby driving out the enemy, recovering national territory, and achieving a glorious victory.

<p>Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guling by Central News Agency, 24th] The following is Chairman Chiang's speech at the Lushan Summer Camp: It has been nine years since the end of the Lushan Summer Training Corps, which began on July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937] when the War of Resistance started. During these nine years, our nation has encountered unprecedented dangers and hardships. Fortunately, thanks to the bloodshed and sacrifice of the people and soldiers across the country, we were able to achieve final victory. In this first summer after the victory, it is truly a rare opportunity for all our young people to participate in the Lushan Summer Camp to receive training. As you enter the camp today, I hope everyone will recognize the significance and purpose of our training. Under the guidance of your teachers and officers, study and learn, cultivate your body and mind, and especially hone your moral character and forge your integrity, so as not to fail as followers of the Three Principles of the People and to fulfill your great mission of revolution and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, since the September 18th Incident, China has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities, internal troubles and external threats coming one after another. By the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the crisis of the nation had reached its extreme point. At that time, most people in the country had lost confidence in the future of national revival and the success of the revolutionary cause, believing that the national crisis was beyond salvation. It was precisely at this time of national crisis and popular demoralization that we founded the Lushan Training Corps in the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. From then on, once a year, we gathered military and political cadres to study the situation of the National Revolution, discuss major domestic and foreign policies, strengthen resolve, cultivate spirit, strive for self-improvement, and prepare for a final showdown with all reactionary and aggressive forces at home and abroad, as well as false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. Finally, in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], as the Japanese寇’s aggression against China intensified day by day, forcing us to the final moment when we could no longer tolerate it, we decided to launch a full-scale War of Resistance against Japan. Therefore, our Party led the military and civilians, concentrated our forces, persevered, became more courageous in the face of setbacks, fought hard for eight years, and finally achieved the goal of driving out the enemy and recovering our national territory today. It can be said that this victory is all due to the effects achieved by the five years of summer training at the Lushan Training Corps. This five years of summer training in Lushan can be said to be the only pivotal force for our Chinese nation to be reborn from the dead and to turn danger into safety. This great historical significance is something that our young people must know.</p>
<p>Because the past Lushan Training had such great achievements, the officers and students of our Lushan Summer Camp today must especially recognize the importance of the mission you are shouldering. You must know that our Lushan Summer Camp this year is different from the summer camps of previous years. Therefore, in the camp, we must not only cultivate our body and mind and study academics, but also recognize the current situation, the revolutionary situation, and the future of our nation. Therefore, we must especially study how to seek social stability, the people's welfare, and national unity, and ensure the great victory of the War of Resistance that our soldiers and civilians have won with sacrifice and bloodshed over the past eight years, in order to implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the modern construction of the Republic of China. We must have clear answers to these questions, and be able to put them into practice, be practical and realistic, continue our spirit of resistance, not fail our revolutionary integrity, cultivate a great personality, lead the youth, be the vanguard of the people, remain consistent throughout, not fail to be a model for the people, and not fail to be followers of the Three Principles of the People. Only then can we achieve the purpose of participating in this Lushan Summer Camp.</p>

In addition to inquiring about the general situation of the Jiangxi ceramics industry, he also instructed on ways to research and improve in the future. In terms of quality, it should catch up with the exquisiteness of the products of the Kangxi and Qianlong eras. In terms of patterns, more famous Chinese paintings from past dynasties should be collected and imitated to promote China's inherent art. In addition, the Chairman suggested that the original "Imperial Kiln" in Jingdezhen should be renamed "National Kiln" and its products should be distributed to allied nations to commemorate their great kindness in assisting China's War of Resistance. Finally, he instructed Principal Wang to draft an overall improvement plan for the Jiangxi porcelain industry, which would be implemented by the Jiangxi Provincial Government.</p>

<p>The National Army Fights Back in Self-Defense</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 24th] Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Tang Enbo, recently arrived in Nanjing. The reporter made a special visit to his private residence to talk about the situation of the war in Northern Jiangsu. Mr. Tang first used a journalistic term, saying, "We military personnel who work in the field very much hope that those who work in the office will be able to achieve successful political negotiations." He then said, "We do not want to fight, but to fight back. They attacked us, so we cannot but fight back. As for Northern Jiangsu, we have made appropriate defenses for self-defense, and there is absolutely no possibility of Shanghai being threatened. The 共 army's offensive tactics are all disruptive, so although there are many people, they are not accustomed to positional warfare. The most suffering people at present are the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, who are displaced and in extremely miserable conditions. As for the territory of Nantong County, the 共 army has now been cleared, and it is more peaceful than it was two months ago." It is heard that Mr. Tang will still go to a certain place in Northern Jiangsu in the coming days to inspect, and his command headquarters will be moved from Wuxi to the capital.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Minister Peng's Talk <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Central News Agency, 24th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 PM on the 24th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: Will peace talks be resumed soon, and will they be held in Nanjing or Guling?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: Peace talks have never stopped, and they can be held in Nanjing or Guling at any time.</p>
<p>Question: The Central Daily News recently stated that the government will implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. To what extent is this news correct?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The government's efforts to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, such as the government taking over the entire Northeast, reorganizing the army, and restoring transportation, have all encountered unexpected obstacles. Recently, the government decided to automatically implement the most important resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, which is to convene a National Assembly on a regular basis. This date is quite far away in order to have sufficient preparation time, but the 共 side has objected to this date without giving sufficient reasons. The government will continue to work in this direction. In short, the most important thing in the economic aspect at present is to restore railway transportation, especially the railways in Shandong. If this is done, it will have a major impact on prices. In economics, this is the most important factor. The most important measure in the political aspect is to convene the National Assembly, because this move is the key to ending tutelage and starting constitutional government, urging all parties to quickly achieve it.</p>

The Ambassador replied, "Since returning to Nanjing from Lushan, tonight is the first time I have met with reporters, so I really don't know where that news came from. I have never drafted the so-called two documents either." The Ambassador said that, "My two days in Lushan allowed me to have four in-depth conversations with Chairman Chiang, which deepened my understanding of the Chinese situation. It is true that I said I was more optimistic when I went down the mountain than when I went up. As for what that foreign reporter said, 'I think both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are suitable for China's national conditions,' these words did not come from my mouth." The Ambassador's spirits have recovered today. At 10:00 AM, General Marshall visited the Embassy and met with the Ambassador for an hour, the content of which was still to exchange views on the National-Communist negotiations.

After finishing the conversation with the reporter tonight, he immediately went to the unprecedented music concert at the National Assembly Hall in Beijing (news on page 2).</p>

<h3 id="e12">U.S. Reiterates Policy Towards China; Promote Peace and Unity; U.S. Newspaper Hopes for National-Communist Cooperation and Self-Help <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] A State Department spokesman reiterated today the U.S. policy towards China: intending to unite all parties and factions to form a coalition government. At a press conference held by the spokesman, when asked about the important declaration made by Madam Sun Soong Qingling in Shanghai, which advocated the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, what was the opinion of the U.S. government? The spokesman answered with the above statement, and said, "The U.S. policy towards China has been announced repeatedly, which is to promote the unity of China, and this is also the mission of Special Envoy Marshall in China." The spokesman also asked the reporters to pay attention to the recent statement by Deputy Secretary of State Acheson on U.S. policy towards China, in which one important sentence was: The United States will do its best to prevent civil war in China and send Japanese troops home.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] San Francisco broadcast, Senator Bei Bo said: He does not hesitate to endorse the military aid to China bill, if the munitions provided by the bill will be used for civil war, but he believes that legislation can be formulated to authorize Marshal Marshall to supervise the application of the munitions. In the House of Representatives, Chairman Blum of the Foreign Affairs Committee said: He can find a way to specify this in detail when the committee passes it, but other leaders feel that there is little hope that the bill will be passed in this meeting. In the Senate, the bill is being discussed by the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The Philadelphia Inquirer commented on the development of the Chinese situation today, calling the resurgence of conflict between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists a "dangerous and deeply disappointing shift." The newspaper continued: "We should do everything we can to prevent a civil war in China, but if U.S. lend-lease military supplies encourage China's belligerent actions, then these supplies should be stopped immediately and efforts should be made to withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China. We should not leave U.S. soldiers and Marines in an unconscious conflict, which will inevitably plunge the Chinese people deeper into the abyss of misery."</p>
<p>The Toledo Blade of Ohio commented in an editorial on July 20th: "Peace cannot be forcibly imposed on China. Only if Chinese leaders cooperate with each other can peace come. If China does not help itself, we cannot help it. The hard work of our special envoy General Marshall will be in vain unless the leaders of both the central government and the Communist Party immediately stop their efforts to undermine peace."</p>

<h3 id="e13">My Northeastern Industrial Equipment Completely Moved Away by the Soviets: The Largest Natural Resources in the Far East Vanished, Pauley Releases Preliminary Report <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Edwin Pauley, President Truman's personal representative investigating reparations issues for defeated Axis powers, accused the Soviet Union at a press conference today of excessively removing industrial equipment from Northeast China. He also strongly advocated for implementing the European reparations plan according to the Potsdam Agreement. Pauley's preliminary report includes the details of a 49,000-mile journey across Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>In his prepared statement, Pauley stated: "My report finds the following three main points: There has been no large-scale removal of industrial equipment in the Soviet-controlled area of northern Korea. Many Japanese industries, though still in a state of shutdown, have complete equipment. The industry south of the 38th parallel relies on the industry in the north, and the industry in the north relies on the south. If Korea can obtain Japanese light industry, it can also receive considerable industrial assistance. The situation in Northeast China, in terms of moving industrial equipment, is exactly the opposite of the mood in Korea. According to examples we have seen in Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and Harbin, all power, steel, mining, gasification, and other manufacturing plants, during the Soviet occupation, had all movable equipment completely removed. It is regrettable that this kind of industrial machinery could not remain in place. This machinery was the pinnacle of Northeast China's natural resources and was considered the largest natural resource in the Far East. The lives and happiness of nine hundred million people benefited from these factories. In my opinion, the people of the Far East will need at least a century to recover their losses. The reparations plan under the Potsdam Agreement has not been successfully implemented. This failure is partly because some countries are unwilling to view the defeated nations as a whole economic unit, as was agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. Unless the occupying powers can cooperate sincerely and strive to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement, we will repeat the mistakes of World War I. After World War I, the Allied powers, including the United States, funded the reconstruction of Germany's war machine, which was then used against us in World War II. At that time, we did not remember the main objective, which was to eliminate Germany's war potential. This time, we must avoid such mistakes. The Potsdam Agreement is a guarantee to prevent such a tragedy. I hope that no country or group of countries will forcibly cancel the Potsdam Agreement." Pauley continued: A policy is being considered to withhold Germany's reparations to the Soviet Union in order to offset the materials removed by the Soviet Union from Northeast China. Pauley also stated: The United States has never agreed to the Soviet Union's request for $10 billion in reparations from Germany, and he personally does not approve of it. Pauley reiterated his own and the U.S. government's belief in the Potsdam Agreement. Pauley also stated: Japan's investment in Northeast China amounted to tens of billions of dollars, of which about $2 billion has been taken away. Northeast China is now reverting to an agricultural economy. Pauley also revealed that he intends to find a way to coordinate actions to move some Japanese factories to Northeast China. General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, has recommended this step to the Far East Commission in Washington.</p>

<p>Advance Levy of Land Tax to Aid Military Provisions: Suzhou Reduced to 20,000 Shis</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou Correspondence] The Suzhou Province Land and Grain Review Conference representatives of the county’s landowners, Song Xucheng, Chen Youzhi, etc., returned to Suzhou at about 8:00 PM on the 22nd. The reporter immediately interviewed them to inquire about the proceedings. They reported that the main issues of this conference were the 35th-year implementation plan for the levy of land tax and grain, and the proposal to advance levy land tax to aid the military provisions. Regarding the levy of grain, the central government originally stipulated that this province’s land tax for this year, according to pre-war rates, would be collected in rice at three dou per yuan, plus a 30% (nine sheng) levy for public grain, plus an additional 1.5 dou. In total, 5.4 dou of rice would be levied. Subsequently, Chairman Wang and Speaker Leng made several trips to the capital to request a reduction in the levy amount. The Ministry of Food approved a central government reduction in the levy of 0.5 dou, totaling 4.9 dou. This amount would then be collected at a 40% discount, meaning that those who paid one yuan in grain before the war would pay 1.96 dou of rice this year. As for the advance levy of land tax, since the grain collection period is still far off, the military provisions for July, August, and September are not secured and must be advanced. The county was originally assigned 30,000 shis, but after vigorous efforts, it was reduced to 20,000 shis of unhusked rice, which will be processed immediately and must be delivered by the end of August.</p>
<p>Wuxi: All Ten-Plus Silk Factories on Strike</p>
<p>In this county, regarding the issue of wages in the silk industry, Commissioner Xu of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Magistrate Xu convened a meeting on the 17th of this month at the county government to mediate between labor and management. Because labor and management had vastly different opinions, the meeting ended on an unhappy note. On the morning of the 22nd, when work began, female workers in over ten factories in the eastern district suddenly went on strike. When the Industrial Union learned of this, it dispatched personnel to persuade them and convened an emergency meeting of all the female workers to mediate. The issue of resuming work has not yet been resolved. Because the responsible persons of the silk factories have all gone to Shanghai to attend the first board of directors meeting of the Three Districts Silk Industry Association, Magistrate Xu Yuanruo has sent a handwritten note to the Silk Factory Association, urgently telegraphing the association’s president Gao Jingyuan and others to quickly return to Wuxi and await mediation.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Land Tax Grain Levy Decided Amount: The province’s land tax grain levy has been reviewed and decided upon in a meeting convened by the provincial government. The decided amount will be 3 dou of tax per mu, 9 sheng of public grain, and 1 dou advance levied, all calculated at 40%, with the actual levy at 1.96 dou per mu. The advance levied portion will be returned in the future, and the collection is set to begin on September 1st.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Tian Xiushan Case Submitted to the Capital for Instructions</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Tian Xiushan of eastern Zhejiang, after being captured by the self-defense team in the Wangyu county area, has been escorted to Hangzhou. He was interrogated by the Provincial Security Command, and Tian the Bandit confessed without denial to all the crimes he committed. Currently, the Provincial Security Department believes that the Bandit Tian case is quite complicated. He also has the status of an active military officer, serving as a major general advisor to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, so a document has been prepared and submitted to the central government for instructions to determine a suitable sentence.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Path of Local Politics <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference opened on the 20th of this month. For days, the conference has reviewed the government program, the three-year construction plan, and other administrative measures. The representatives also put forward motions on civil affairs, finance, grain, education, construction, public security, conscription, public welfare, and local self-government, totaling more than 150. They will be categorized and discussed in detail. At a time when the nation is struggling and the local areas are suffering, the convening of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference by Chairman Shen Honglie to discuss what should be built and reformed locally and actively promote local self-government is particularly significant. Although we are located in the city, and lately because of the entangled national affairs and repeated international crises, our attention is often focused on the development of the domestic and international situation, our hearts are always thinking about the local areas and caring about the local areas. Because if local politics are not handled well, nation-building is like building a castle in the air, and if the nation is not built well, its international status will inevitably decline. Therefore, we not only value the convening of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference, but also have great expectations for it. We remember that before Chairman Shen came to Zhejiang, the Zhejiang people in Shanghai hoped that he would build Zhejiang into a model province. Therefore, the success or failure of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference is not only related to Zhejiang Province, but also to the general local politics.</p>
<p>Speaking of local politics, it is felt that the local areas have long been corrupted beyond repair. During the War of Resistance, in order to support the nation’s established national policy, the local areas disregarded everything and contributed massive manpower and material resources to the nation in order to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance. For eight years, the local areas were exhausted and on their last breath, which has long been known to all. After the victory, the national situation still could not be stabilized because of the Communist Party problem, and any local area would be affected to some extent. The so-called "liberated areas" under the control of the CCP need not be mentioned. Even in the Jiangzhe area, which is known for its prosperity, the people's livelihood, especially the rural life, can be said to be unspeakably miserable. The people of the whole country tightened their belts, gritted their teeth, and endured hardships for eight years to win the victory. But unexpectedly, the country won the victory, but the people's suffering remained, even to the point of being in deep water and burning fire. How will the government be able to face the people! Therefore, the first task of the local officials, who are the "parents of the people," is to understand the people's suffering, and the first step of governance is to let the people recuperate and gradually wake up from the ruins of the war. This is true for all provinces, and Zhejiang is no exception.</p>
<p>There are many ways to relieve the people's suffering, but the most important thing is that they must be practical and easy to implement. If you only know how to talk eloquently, it may sound pleasant, but it is not practical. Not only may it not reduce the people's suffering, but it may even increase the factors that prevent people from living and working in peace. Therefore, today's local authorities should first rest with the people and do fewer things that disturb the people. The people are already extremely grateful. The people's hopes for the government are very simple: first, integrity and honesty, and second, efficiency in handling affairs. And at the moment, abolishing the harsh levies and reducing the people's burdens is even more urgent. Although we also oppose the political philosophy of "non-action and governance," seeing the current local situation with thousands of holes, we really feel that the government must start by cultivating vitality. "If the green hills remain, there will be no fear of running out of firewood." We want to appeal to the people to let them keep some "green hills" first, so that they can contribute their "firewood" in the future.</p>
<p>At present, the situation in our country's rural areas is, frankly, "Nineteen provinces and regions report disasters, and 30 million people are starving." The entire rural area is on the verge of bankruptcy. How to revive the rural areas is the most serious problem at present. Taking Zhejiang as an example, the panic of rural manpower and plowing cattle, and the lack of fertilizer, have also become thorny problems. The American experts of the Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group have already arrived in China. Although they are responsible for the task of reviving the rural areas, "agricultural scientification" will still face many difficulties in practice in China's rural areas with backward knowledge. Therefore, we believe that popular education in rural areas should be strengthened in particular.</p>
<p>We have studied the politics of various countries in the world and know that all countries have their grassroots organizations. The nation-building strategy planned by the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, also first focused on the grassroots organization with the county as the unit of self-government. Therefore, in today's China, if you want to implement democratic politics, you must first earnestly promote local self-government. Sun Yat-sen's Doctrine of People's Rights advocates first training the people in various places to exercise the four political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, so that they can fully express public opinion. The main spirit of the new county system promoted by President Chiang is also to "strengthen local organizations, promote self-government, and lay the foundation for revolutionary nation-building." Therefore, the work of nation-building and rejuvenation should start from the county level, and the province is only located between the central government and the county, responsible for promoting the central government's policies and supervising local self-government. If Zhejiang Province is serious about being a model for the whole country in this period of nation-building and rejuvenation and moving towards the road of political democratization, then the Zhejiang authorities should make extraordinary efforts to complete local self-government as soon as possible, and cultivating the people's spirit of the rule of law is especially urgent.</p>
<p>Although a history of political thought in our country has revealed democratic ideas very early, the traditional concept of emphasizing the rule of rites rather than the rule of law for thousands of years is also undeniable. Therefore, the general spirit of the rule of law in society still needs to be greatly promoted and cultivated. Especially at present, the administration of the general lower-level local areas should pay special attention to the rule of law. The Chinese proverb has always said that "It is easy to see the King of Hell, but difficult to be a judge," which shows that senior officials may still value the law, but the scribes, servants, and yamen runners, taking advantage of their power, really make the people uncomfortable. Now that we want to promote local self-government, the affairs of the local areas should be entrusted to the people who are elected by the people to be responsible for handling them, and there is no need to borrow hands from official governance. And those who are elected to handle self-government should especially respect the rule of law. In this way, from the bottom up, the spirit of the rule of law will be widely cultivated, and the advantages of democracy will be carried forward, and the common malpractices of local politics today can be swept away. Instead of singing democracy in vain, it is better to work hard and promote local politics in a down-to-earth manner. All provinces should do the same, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which is holding an administrative conference, should take the lead.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Target Fleet of Eighty-Seven Vessels, 30,000 Personnel; Atomic Bomb Re-tested This Morning; Destructive Power Even More Intense Than Last Aerial Explosion <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 24th announced that the underwater atomic bomb test will be held at 8:35 AM tomorrow morning (Bikini time) at Bikini Atoll. All preparations are complete. It will explode 20-30 feet underwater. Scientists believe that its destructive power will be even stronger than the last test.</p>
<p>[United Press, Outside Bikini Atoll, 24th] Unless a storm breaks out at the last minute, this historic fifth atomic bomb will explode at the scheduled time tomorrow morning. Scientists are confident that it will not cause tsunamis, earthquakes, or storms in any part of the Pacific Ocean. More than 30,000 personnel participating in the test are now waiting for orders in various locations. Only the 87 target ships remain in the lagoon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Atomic Bomb Test Observation Ship Appalachia, 24th] Early this morning, a small boat was towed into Bikini Lagoon. It is believed that the atomic bomb will be detonated under the small boat. The bomb will be covered with a curtain so that the sailors who sink the bomb into the water will not see it. Dr. Holloway will handle the procedure of detonating the atomic bomb. The observation ship Panamint, carrying scientists and foreign observers, and the observation ship Blue Ridge, carrying military observers, may arrive from Kwajalein late tonight. Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, has ordered the bomb to be detonated immediately after 8:35 AM (Bikini time) tomorrow morning. At the same time, weather observation work has not stopped all day. If the weather is bad, an order may be issued to postpone the explosion until midnight (Bikini time).</p>

<h3 id="e24">One Million Tons of Seawater Thrown into the Air Will Form a Huge Plume-Shaped Water Column <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Onboard the McKinley, 23rd] Meteorologists predict that the weather will be good on July 25th for dropping the first atomic bomb to explode underwater, causing unexpected and enormous pressure on seventy-five ships. The dense clouds over Bikini Atoll have drifted south for a hundred miles with the tropical air. Underwater explosions do not require perfect conditions, but there must be wind reaching a height of 20,000 feet, blowing from east to west, to carry away water droplets or raindrops containing radiation. The sky also needs to be relatively clear for photographic recording of the explosion. According to a scientist, the shock of an underwater explosion will be a hundred times greater than the aerial explosion on July 1st. Dr. Shay, the Director of Scientific Forces, stated that there would probably be no flash visible in an underwater explosion, only a fountain erupting from the water's surface, reaching a height of two or three miles. Oceanographers predict that this water column will branch out, with water splashing in all directions, resembling a tall pine tree, creating a spectacular sight. Scientists also suggest that this water column will not boil and will emit little steam. The plume-shaped water column stirred up by the atomic bomb will be relatively narrow, with its tip almost solid, like a projectile, initially traveling at about two thousand feet per second. Within a fraction of a second after the explosion, a large hole, shaped like a giant pot, will form under the rising water column in the lagoon, with an opening two thousand five hundred feet wide, exposing the lake bottom about a few feet below the previous level, with a diameter of about one or two hundred feet. This giant hole is formed because the explosive force pushes outward to the sides. However, it is expected that all target ships, except for the battleship *Arkansas*, will not sink into the giant hole. Scientists predict that the atomic wave will not cross Bikini Atoll, only reaching about three or four hundred feet inland.</p>
<p>A Large Amount of Seawater Pours onto the Ships</p>
<p>[United Press, Onboard the *Appalachian*, Atomic Bomb Test Observation Ship, 23rd] When the atomic bomb explodes underwater, X-rays with several radiations in the water will explode into danger. An underwater explosion will throw about one million tons of seawater into the air, much of which emits X-rays and other less dangerous radiation. Seawater itself will not have radioactive, but the and other ordinary atoms in the sea will become extremely hot due to the influence of radiation. A large amount of seawater will pour onto the ships, and in addition, a dense fog containing X-ray tube elements will drift with the wind and the ships. According to Major General Parsons, who dropped the Hiroshima atomic bomb, a large amount of water containing beta radiation will fall like a shower on the spot. When this seawater evaporates from the ships, some of the beta rays or X-rays may be evaporated, but most may remain on the deck. In addition, a few seconds after the underwater explosion, another type of beta ray or X-ray hazard is expected to occur above the cloud of steam. When this steam passes over the ships, radiation will be left on board.</p>
<p>Possible Discovery of New Factors</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Onboard the *Appalachian*, Bikini Atoll, 23rd] Scientists estimate and calculate based on previous small-scale underwater bomb tests, stating that many unknown factors will appear during the second atomic bomb test. Generally speaking, the underwater shock will be at least ten thousand times more violent than any underwater explosion experienced in history. This fifth atomic bomb may convert forty to ninety percent of its atomic energy into the water itself. According to Blandy, the atomic bomb test authorities will not issue special eye protection to the reporters this time, because although we can get closer to the explosion this time than the first time, it is not expected that we will see any light from the underwater explosion. The ships carrying the reporters this time are about eleven miles from the target center, which is more than half the distance we were from the target center during the first test.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British Foreign Office announced tonight that Foreign Secretary Bevin "did not express much approval" for the cable from U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes requesting the immediate publication of the draft peace treaty. The spokesman stated in a not entirely decisive tone that the British government may refuse on the grounds that publishing it at this time would not be very helpful. Conversely, Britain believes that publishing this draft, which has not been fully agreed upon, before the Paris Peace Conference may reduce the chances of reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>Cable to Britain</p>
<p>The Egyptian cable to Britain, sent on June 20th, stated in part: "The Egyptian government earnestly hopes that the resolutions taken by the United Nations can be implemented immediately and achieve their objectives. To impose a trusteeship system on Palestine would be a violation of the Charter. Therefore, the current situation arising from the trusteeship must be brought to an end, and a new government must be established in accordance with the principles of the Charter." The cable reiterated the earlier request for negotiations and strongly emphasized that the guarantees stipulated in the White Paper must not be violated. Finally, it emphasized that the Egyptian government, in order to avoid turmoil in Palestine and for the sake of the security of the Arab countries in the Middle East, must respond to the people's demands. The cable was signed by Egyptian Foreign Minister It.</p>

<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 24th] Today was the third day of General Qin Dechun's testimony as a witness at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. U.S. defense attorney Kollen pressed Qin aggressively, and finally, believing that Qin's answers were ambiguous, abruptly withdrew from the court.

<p>Qin Dechun did not give direct answers to question. Kollen then asked the presiding judge to declare: "The witness's answers are ambiguous." The presiding judge retorted: "This is because the defense attorney himself is providing the witness with opportunity." Kollen then protested to the court, saying, "If the court believes that this testimony is satisfactory, then I will cease cross-examination. General Qin is deliberately evading the key points of the questions, which is clearly beyond the scope of the witness's testimony and is detrimental to the defendant," and abruptly withdrew from the court.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Met Seven Years Ago and Used Today, A Key Suspect in the Rong Case Arrested in Fuzhou, Zhu Chansheng Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday, Identified the Hostage and Received US$5,000, Luo Weiquan, Who Guarded the Ransom, Also Arrested in Pudong <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Thanks to the diligent pursuit by military and police agencies, over twenty ringleaders and accomplices in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case have been arrested. Another key suspect in the case, Zhu Chansheng (alias Xu Menglin), fled to Fuzhou. After the Municipal Police Bureau learned of this, they urgently telegraphed the Fuzhou Water Police Corps to dispatch police to arrest the suspect at the International Hotel. The Municipal Police Bureau sent officers on a ship to escort him back, and he arrived in Shanghai at approximately 0:30 AM yesterday for processing. According to the suspect's confession to the Fuzhou Water Police Corps, he is 47 years old, from Wuxi, unemployed, and resides at No. 131 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinza Road. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for theft in 1927. Regarding the Rong Desheng kidnapping case, he served as an inside man because my husband (the so-called "old man"), Rong Binggen, is a relative of Rong Desheng. As far back as seven years ago, when something happened in Rong's factory, my husband handled everything. At that time, I often went with my husband, so I was very familiar with Rong Desheng. As for the kidnapping process, Yuan Zhongzhu, who I have known for many years, approached me. At the end of March, I met Yuan on the street, and he invited me to his house to chat. After arriving at his residence, we talked about how he spent 2 million legal tender when he was arrested last time, and now he is very short of money and wants to do something to Rong Desheng, but he doesn't know him personally. You are very familiar with him, please help me. I asked him how I could help. He said that I only need to lead him to recognize Rong Desheng's face, and I don't need to worry about anything else, let them handle it. I agreed at the time and arranged to meet him at Dasanyuan Teahouse at 8:00 AM on April 3rd. When I arrived, I met Yuan and went to the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Zhongzheng South Road to wait. At about 10:00 AM, I saw Rong Desheng passing by in a black car with the license plate 21162. I told Yuan that the person sitting on the left side of the car was him. Yuan looked carefully and said, "I recognize him," and then we returned home separately. Before parting, Yuan instructed me to meet him at his house in three days. When the time came, I went to Yuan's residence and met him. Yuan's friend Zhang Mingda (real surname Luo, nicknamed "Old Man") was also present. Yuan asked me, "Will you take me to see Rong Desheng's face again today?" So I went with Yuan to the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Zhongzheng East Road. At about 10:00 AM, Rong Desheng's car drove past again. Yuan Zhongzhu stepped forward to take a closer look and said, "I recognize him now. The one surnamed Zheng is also watching on Second Road. Once you have seen him, I will notify you when things are successful in the future." After speaking, I went home. More than twenty days later, I saw news in the newspaper about Rong Desheng being kidnapped. Later, I found Yuan Zhongzhu in a swallow's nest in Huanghe Road. He said that this matter was very difficult and there was no way to contact him, so he told me to go to the countryside to avoid the limelight. He would notify me when there was news, and we would meet at Xiaomaoniang Swallow's Nest on Fourth Road next time. So I went to Wuxi to avoid the limelight temporarily. About two weeks later, I met Yuan at Xiaomaoniang Swallow's Nest. He said that things had been settled and the money had been placed with Zhang Mingda, and it would be handed over in three days. On the fourth day, I met at Xiaomaoniang's house. Yuan gave me US$5,000, saying that there were too many people involved, so I should use less. Shanghai is no longer a place to live, so it's best to leave this place. So I returned home. A week later, I hurried back to my hometown of Henglin in Changzhou and bought about 100 jin of orchids, spending more than 1 million yuan. About a week later, I returned to Shanghai. While drinking tea at Dadong Teahouse, I met Shen Bomin, a compradore of Dengkeng Shipping, through the introduction of my friend Meng A'er (named Youzhang). Shen talked about how cheap sugar was in Fuzhou and proposed to invest together to buy it. After Meng, Shen, and I agreed to each invest 2 million yuan, a total of 6 million yuan, we entrusted Shen to buy it. So I handed Shen Bomin a ten-tael gold bar, which was converted into 2 million legal tender. Because the situation in Shanghai was too tense, I used the pretext of buying sugar to take the Dengkeng Shipping to Fuzhou, arriving in Fuzhou on June 29. I opened room 6 at the International Hotel, and later moved to room 3. On July 6, at about 6:00 PM, I went out to cool off and was arrested by the Water Police Corps. As for Shen and Meng, they knew nothing about the Rong Desheng kidnapping case. When I arrived in Fuzhou, I only brought 95,000 legal tender. After arriving in Fuzhou, all the miscellaneous expenses were borrowed from Shen Bomin, totaling 400,000 yuan. Please deduct it from the 2 million yuan gold bar. According to a responsible person from the Municipal Police Bureau, although Zhu has been extradited to Shanghai, the police officers handling the case have traveled back and forth for many days and have been mentally exhausted along the way. After a short rest, they will bring the suspect out again, interrogate him strictly, and record his statement. As for how they learned that Zhu was a key suspect in the Rong case, it was very tortuous and also a coincidence. Because a police officer lived in the same alley as Zhu, he caught a glimpse of Zhu buying furniture and wearing gorgeous clothes after getting the loot, which was very different from before. So he aroused his attention and made many inquiries. On June 25, he reported to his superiors. After reporting to his superiors, he led the police to search his house and discovered that Zhu himself had left Shanghai. He also learned that his wife had returned to Henglin, so he became more suspicious and rushed to Henglin by car, arrested his wife, and confiscated US$3,000, a diamond ring, and a gold bracelet, and brought them to Shanghai for interrogation. She then revealed everything. The next morning, another tip was received, saying that a tailor was accompanying Zhu on the Dengkeng Shipping to Taiwan that morning. At that time, the ship had already sailed out, and the police authorities sent a telegram to Chief Yu of the Fuzhou Water Police Corps, asking him to assist. When the Dengkeng Shipping entered Wusongkou a few days later, they sent police to arrest the compradore Shen Bomin, who confessed that Zhu was in Fuzhou. When the ship sailed abroad again, they sent officers Zhang Faxiang, Chen Xianrong, and Ren Gongqin to board the ship. When they arrived in Fuzhou, Zhu had already been captured by the Water Police.</p>
<p>[Another report] Luo Weiquan (nicknamed Luo Shusheng), the key suspect in the Rong case who was responsible for guarding the ransom, was tracked down by Tao, the director of the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, who ordered his subordinates to step up the investigation. Under the instructions of their superiors, Zheng, the director of the Shanghai West Inspection Office, and Wang, the director of the office, conducted several discussions and investigations. On the 19th of this month, they learned that Luo was at the Longwang Temple in Pudong, and the No. 7244 civilian ship transporting the ransom, had come to Shanghai from Pudong. They immediately sent Huang Xiexin, Zhou Yunjiang, etc., to the No. 3 Wharf of the South City Guanhua Bridge, detained the ship, and arrested the boatman Pan Jinlong (who claimed that he did not participate in the kidnapping). They then went to Pudong and arrested Luo. He confessed that he was a disciple of the ringleader Luo Wenqing and was ordered to guard the ransom in Gongyi Lane.</p>

Attendees included committee members Fan Zhengbo, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Wangji, Zhang Qingzhen, and Secretary Xu Longchuan, totaling six people. The following was decided: (1) The committee meetings of the Investigating Team and the receiving and dispatching of documents will be at the Supervisory Commissioner's Office. For the convenience of accessing case files and registers, the office will be located at Room 217 on the second floor of the Bank of China (note that this location is only one floor away from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the main target of the investigation). (2) Committee meetings will be held every Wednesday at 10:00 AM. If there are important matters, they will be convened on an ad hoc basis. (3) In addition to transferring personnel from various agencies according to the investigation methods, the Investigating Team's working methods should also seek the earnest assistance of people's organizations, especially various trade associations. (4) Committee members Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji were appointed to draft a work plan to be presented for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Complaints Must Include Real Names</p>
<p>It is reported that, as of yesterday, the Investigating Team had received more than ten letters of complaint from the public. However, many of them did not include real names and addresses. Therefore, the team discussed this matter during its first meeting yesterday morning. After the meeting, the person in charge of the team stated that, according to the investigation procedures, the team can accept confidential reports from the public. If anyone knows of any illegal or corrupt practices regarding the receiving and handling of enemy and puppet materials, they can list the facts in writing or provide evidence for processing. However, the informant must write their real name and detailed address and must not make false accusations out of malice. The team will keep the informant's information confidential. Furthermore, due to the busy workload and limited funding, the team will transfer some personnel from various agencies in the city to assist with the work. It is reported that Zhang Quan and Wang Shiwei have already been transferred from the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office to serve as staff members of the group and will begin work today.</p>

<p>The Joint Federation for Safeguarding Navigation Rights convened its first general assembly yesterday afternoon at the Dada Datong Joint Venture office on the Bund. Attendees included representatives from the Songhu Pilot Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Chinese Marine Engineers Association, the Chinese Merchant Shipmasters Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Tongsha Pilot Association, and the Shanghai Shipowners Association. Jin Yueshi was elected chairman. Standing Committee Member Li reported on the progress of the appeal to open up four ports along the Yangtze River. After President Song adopted public opinion and revised it to the "Method of Designating Nanjing and Hankou as Temporary Berthing Docks," the representatives discussed it and unanimously resolved to appeal to the government that the import of foreign goods is more harmful than beneficial to the national economy, and inland navigation is of great importance to national defense. The second item of the method proposed by the government to designate Nanjing and Hankou as temporary berthing docks, which allows certain types of commercial goods to be loaded and transported on foreign vessels sailing inland, still has many drawbacks. It is particularly detrimental to the country's agriculture, industry, commerce, and navigation industries. It should be revised to limit imports to relief supplies and government supplies, and there should be no restrictions on exports. Imported foreign goods of a commercial nature that are sufficient to constitute a large amount of import surplus should not be smuggled in. Those who violate this will be treated as smugglers. In addition, the government was requested by telegram to promptly order the Jianghai Customs to cancel the announcement of the opening of coastal navigation rights on March 21 of this year.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chen Guoquan, the director of the Puppet Rice Grain Control Committee, was examined by the High Court's collegiate panel yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 31st. Chen argued in court yesterday: After the August 13th Incident, after the Nationalist army withdrew from Shanghai, he was ordered to stay in Shanghai to preserve the property of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This continued for four years until the Pacific War broke out and he was discovered by the enemy and then monitored. The defendant initially joined the puppet government out of compulsion. After joining, he maintained the people's food supply and did his best to reclaim civilian rice, otherwise, it would all be seized by the enemy as military rice. This was entirely for the service of the people. During his two years in office, he never embezzled or got rich. The law is based on reason and should not listen to false accusations. He asked the court to make a fair judgment.</p>
<p>[Another report] Jiang Yougen, the director of the Zhejiang Ningbo Red Gang Carpenters' Union, and Zuo Ming, a translator for the Japanese company Yama Hisa, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court for recruiting 180 workers to work in the Philippines for the Japanese naval attache's office in 1932.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sihang Warehouse was the site of the Battle of the Eight Hundred Heroes in 1937. During the period of occupation, it was seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the original owner, the Sihang Savings Society, repeatedly applied to various agencies for its return, but to no avail. Finally, when Chairman Chiang visited Shanghai, the entire case was submitted for his review, and he approved its return after the municipal government investigated. Only 70% of it was returned successively, and tens of millions of dollars were spent on repairs before it could resume operations. Unexpectedly, the Storage and Transportation Office of the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau recently took possession of half of the warehouse's ground floor with military police stationed there, making it impossible to accept and store the goods promised to customers. It is reported that the warehouse has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to stop this.</p>

<p>Streamlining Traffic and Planning to Expand North Xizang Road</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, in order to guide traffic onto the right track and raise public awareness of traffic regulations, is planning (1) a large-scale traffic publicity week, with special emphasis on the following points: (1) Regulating the time and route of slow-moving vehicles (for example, heavy freight vehicles will have their operating hours restricted, and rickshaws will have their routes restricted), (2) Strictly enforcing one-way traffic, (3) No parking on main streets (at most, temporary one-sided parking will be allowed), (4) Empty vehicles should be parked in parking lots (the Public Utilities Bureau plans to build several parking lots in the city and notify those with parking facilities, such as the International Hotel, to open them), (5) Strengthening traffic police (training traffic police). This publicity campaign will last for two to three weeks.</p>
<p>Regarding another plan to streamline traffic, Zhao is particularly focused on the development of North Xizang Road.

During the banquet, Liu delivered a speech, encouraging his colleagues to continue to work hard to serve the country. He also stated that he would do his best to introduce the current state of China's legal system to the American people during his trip to the United States. Because consular jurisdiction has now been abolished, American expatriates in China are prone to misunderstandings due to their lack of understanding of Chinese law, so it is necessary to give them a considerable understanding to promote friendly relations between the two countries. The trip to the United States will last about a year. In addition to lecturing, he will also study the current American legal system for future reference.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The shipping industry has recently paid close attention to British merchant ships sailing on coastal and Southeast Asian routes. Shipping industry associations and various shipping agencies have expressed their opinions, believing that it is an infringement of navigation rights, and have petitioned the government. It is now learned that two British companies operating coastal routes in the city have changed their plans and are actively seeking other ways to develop towards various ports in Java, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries. The Taikoo Dockyard's Fujian wheel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 31st of this month via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Singapore, bound for Batavia, Semarang, Surabaya, and other ports. The Shandong wheel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the first of next month to Sai Kung and A Luo Jian Gu. Jardine Matheson previously had a Shanghai-India route, which the British government promised would be a patent, so it changed to the Mumbai route. It is said that the business on this route is very good, and the current losses in the shipping industry in China are all subsidized by the Southeast Asian side.</p>
<p>[Another report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is busy with official transport, and the schedule cannot be determined. The company has no ships operating on the Yangtze River route this week. The Shanghai-Yichang and Shanghai-Chongqing routes are maintained by the Minsheng Company.

<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office] European and American countries, as well as the Soviet Union, all promote physical education and train people's physical fitness according to certain standards. China will refer to the situations in various countries and promote standardized exercises so that the general public can reach the prescribed standards through physical education training. At present, physical education training is only applied to students in schools, and there are few concrete measures for the general public. In the future, the Ministry of Education plans to hold standardized exercises, selecting provinces and cities across the country with more physical education facilities and habits to guide them according to their own situation and first establish role models, and then promote them throughout the country. This kind of public physical education training will first be piloted in several provinces and cities (such as Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, etc.), with the local sports field as the place for training the public in physical education. Educational administrative authorities will stipulate standard testing methods so that people know what extent physical exercise must reach in order to meet the standard physical fitness and be a healthy citizen. All ball games and various physical activities in schools will be incorporated into the training, and methods will be stipulated for conducting tests on time. The whole population should strive to gradually reach the standardized exercises. The standard exercises for the people established by the United Kingdom and the United States are at a higher level. China will make appropriate regulations according to the current level of the people, so that they can move forward step by step, and first advocate and implement them in several provinces and cities, and then seek to popularize them. Preparations are planned to be made this year, and implementation is expected to begin next year.</p>

Once the takeover is ready, it will be handed over to the designated factories. It is heard that the designated factories are eager for the government to find a way to make the valuation of the equipment of the enemy factories cheap and reasonable. It is hoped that the highest valuation will not exceed the current price of similar machines in the United States. Otherwise, the factories will have to order a large number of new machines from the United States. This equipment cannot be completed in a short period of time, and it will also consume a large amount of national foreign exchange funds, which is not appropriate. After a reasonable price is estimated, the factories hope to pay 30% of the total amount first, and the difference will be evenly refunded within five years. Among these enemy factories taken over with preferential treatment, some have already started production and have accepted external orders. It is said that there will be no shutdown when the takeover is made, and it will not hinder production and delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Foreign Paper Floods the Market, Paper Merchants' Profits are Thin; High Costs of Domestic Paper Make Competition Impossible <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our office] Recently, paper prices have generally declined. Our reporter specially visited people in the paper industry to inquire about the current situation of the paper industry. According to the report, since the tightening of silver coins at the end of June, many paper shops in the city have been cutting prices to sell their inventories in order to adjust their capital turnover, so the market has been trending downstream. This is because transportation in various places has recently been blocked from time to time, and paper exports have become sluggish. On the one hand, the number of foreign goods arriving has increased day by day, which has led to a general decline in paper prices in the city. Here are some examples to illustrate this: Ordinary double-page newsprint is currently about 14,500 yuan per ream. Canadian newsprint is currently about 27,800 yuan per ream, which is about 30% lower than a dozen days ago. Taking the recent batch of Prince paper from the Soviet Union as an example, the price is only 22,000 yuan per ream. Taking the yellow paper edition as another example, the price reached 1.5 million yuan per ton in October last year, but after the China Paper Industry Corporation repeatedly sold it, the recent price has dropped to 540,000 yuan per ton. However, the cost of foreign goods is now increasing. For example, the cost price of Canadian newsprint when it arrived in Shanghai a few months ago was about 120 US dollars per ton. Recently, it has risen to more than 300 US dollars per ton. The average cost per ream is about 15,000 legal tender. If you add the loss of interest during the several months of ordering, the profits of the imported paper merchants are no longer as abundant as they were a few months ago. As far as the inventory in this street is concerned, it cannot be said to be abundant, but it is not short. However, most paper manufacturers are still unable to reduce the cost of their products due to increased labor costs and high raw material prices. On the other hand, cheap and high-quality foreign goods are constantly arriving, and business is still at a loss. The situation is extremely depressing.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Gold and Paper Money Level and Weak <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stable after a brief rise. There were no speculators supporting the price, and the upward trend was still difficult to sustain. It opened at 1.98 million in the morning and gradually declined slightly. The central government's allocation of ten bars was priced at 1.9625 million. It became even weaker after ten o'clock. Later, the US dollar suddenly weakened, and it fell to 1.94 million near noon before stabilizing slightly. In the afternoon, it hovered around 1.95 million. As a result, it fell more than 20,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were 10,800,000. Silver was level. The hidden discount was also level, and the interest rate was between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>In the foreign currency market, some people still misinterpreted the words "pound sterling and US dollar currency" in the announcement issued by the Central Bank. It was still above 2,600 yuan outside the customs when it opened in the morning. Soon, real goods continued to flow out, and the buying interest weakened again. It was around 2,550 yuan near noon. There was no change in the afternoon. As a result, it fell 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also fell, falling from 565 yuan to below 560 yuan. As a result, it fell 10 yuan from the previous close, and the Hong Kong exchange rate has been leveled. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 550 yuan to 560 yuan, the British exchange rate was 9,000 yuan for sale, the Indian exchange rate was 670 yuan to 680 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Chinese and Foreign Stocks Decline Across the Board <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were inseparable from the old tune, first soaring and then slumping. At high prices, the big players' supply and demand were inconsistent, so the retail investors did not know what to do, and the market was chaotic. The best-selling ones were Yongsha at 695 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,750 yuan, Jingfu at 285 yuan, Xinguang at 280 yuan, and Qinxing at 195 yuan. The weakest were Yongsha at 535 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,250 yuan, Jingfu at 240 yuan, Xinguang at 235 yuan, and Qinxing at 155 yuan. In the afternoon, they rose slightly after falling to a low point. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha and Mei Ya fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by 10% to 10% cow, and small and medium-sized stocks in unpopular sectors also fell by 5% to 10%. Yuanlao stocks also saw a small decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were helpless. Buyers watched from the sidelines and could not withstand the excessive supply from various sectors outside the industry. The market price continued to fall. Yisha was at 9,700 yuan and Yinglian was at 9,800 yuan. There were a few transactions, and buyers disappeared. The weakest was near noon. As a result, Yisha, Yinglian, Huide, and Steel fell by more than 5%. Ye Guang fell by a little less than 10%, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Silk Market is Sluggish <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was unusually quiet, and prices were sluggish. The price of 120-count Guangtianqiao rayon fluctuated between 1.66 million and 1.67 million yuan throughout the day, which was slightly shorter than the previous day, 10 to 20,000 yuan. The quoted prices of other miscellaneous brands of goods were similar to those of the previous day, and there were very few transactions. The factory was stable but revealed sluggishness. Real transactions were weak and very few transactions were made. Silk goods were also weak. Quilt covers and checked crepe were not traded yesterday. Only Huajin crepe was heavily searched by Ke Bang, and the price was profitable. The rest was flat.</p>
<p>Unified Class C Debt Stabilizes at the 800 Mark</p>
<p>Public debt was even more sluggish yesterday. Transactions in various debts were even more idle. The rise and fall were small. Unified Class C opened at 810 yuan in the morning. During the process, it fell from 820 yuan to 790 yuan, but it still stabilized outside 800 yuan near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, A, B, and C debts were level, D debts rose slightly, and E debts fell slightly. Retail investors moved to the stock market, and the trend is unlikely to change.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Sugar Level and Weak <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be level. Although the Chao Bang still quoted 94,500 yuan for raw sugar, a small number of transactions continued to be made at 91,200 yuan. The Guang Bang quoted more than ten pieces of Beihai Dazhuan raw sugar at a price of 75,000 yuan. Only quotations were made and there were very few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Yarn and Cotton Level and Dull <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was neither prosperous nor disgraced, and transactions were still extremely dull. Because the market price in Jingwu and other places was similar to the intermediate price, traffickers hesitated, resulting in a particularly dull market for small yarns. Because factory numbers were unwilling to sell cheaply, large yarns were also in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams fell. The current cotton price in this port was high and level. Because the manufacturers were not easy to negotiate and approach, the holders were unwilling to compromise, resulting in difficult transactions. The manufacturers did not trade at all, and the flower numbers also only decorated transactions. The market is still optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e85">High Japonica Rice Stable, Secondary Indica Rice Continues to Fall <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South rice markets received a total of 8,700 piculs. The market situation in the South was active but not booming, while the North market remained sluggish. The high japonica rice maintained its position, but medium and lower grades continued to decline by 2000-3000 yuan. Medium and lower grades of glutinous rice also continued to decline slightly by 3000-4000 yuan. High-quality goods were relatively stable, but sales were not brisk. The open market for white yuan rice noodles was sluggish due to weak digestion in the local market. Goods arriving from Wuxi by warship flooded the market, creating false excitement, and prices fell by 400-500 yuan. Wheat from Ningbo and Shantou was sluggishly received, with only slightly higher quality being picked up, softening the market and causing a rebound of 400-500 yuan. Factories had no intention to purchase due to the falling price of flour. Bran was scarce and remained firm. Yellow soybeans from Keya were selectively purchased at slightly higher prices, keeping the market firm. Broad beans, mung beans, and yellow sesame were flat. Raw peanuts were selling well in other areas, and although prices were high, they were not in danger. Soybean cake sales were sluggish. Oil prices continued to rise by 1000-2000 yuan due to demand from the Guangdong merchants and a continuing scarcity of supply.</p>

<p>Chinese Debt Continues to Fall in England, Expected to Improve After End of Internal Strife</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The trend of Chinese public bonds during the first half of 1946 has continued to decline. Although there have been no large transactions, the decline in recent weeks has been particularly pronounced. The "Investor's Chronicle," in commenting on the situation, questioned whether the public bond market might be about to turn around. The article pointed out that the end of the struggle between the National Government and the Communist Party is a major factor for China's future. Although the National Government is militarily stronger than its rival, it has shown great tolerance and genuine political demeanor despite any pressure from the Communist side. If the internal strife can be ended quickly, the current price of Chinese public bonds can often be stabilized. A table of the current state of Chinese public bonds is listed below:</p>

<p>Summer Life</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sunglasses: A Seasonal Accessory, A Blessing for Eye Protection - Introducing Important Knowledge <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In the scorching summer sun, sunglasses are an extremely common item, almost like Hong Kong shirts and shorts. For fashionable women in the city, wearing sunglasses is not only for eye protection but also carries the meaning of a seasonal accessory. Imagine adding a pair of black glasses to white shoes, white clothing, and white skin, concealing the pair of black eyes that best express human emotions, easily creating a sense of mystery.</p>
<p>Just by paying a little attention to the passersby on the street, one can imagine the considerable sales of sunglasses in the summer. As for the United States, which has always liked to be unconventional, sales are naturally much larger. It is said that the total number of sunglasses sold each year reaches about 20 million pairs.</p>
<p>However, while many people use sunglasses as decorative accessories, their main purpose is still eye protection. Now, we want to raise a question: do sunglasses actually protect the eyes?</p>
<h3 id="e88">What Kind of Sunglasses Cannot Protect Your Eyes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to statistics from the United States, the more people who wear sunglasses in the summer, the more people suffer from eye diseases, and many people have found blind spots on their eyeballs. A famous ophthalmologist once pointed out that the comfort that sunglasses give to the eyes is very questionable, and in most cases, they have absolutely no protective ability.</p>
<p>Originally, solar radiation is formed by many different types of light. In addition to visible light, there are also invisible ultraviolet rays and glaring heat rays. Low-quality sunglasses are like a piece of smoked and dyed glass, only able to block the dazzling visible light, but they cannot effectively filter out invisible and potentially harmful light. Usually, in bright sunlight, human eyelids will automatically adjust, only allowing the necessary amount of light to pass through the eyeball and produce a clear impression on the retina. However, black sunglasses block visible light, causing the eyelids to open wider than they would without glasses, exposing the sensitive parts inside the eyes to harmful light that the lenses cannot block.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Can You Make Iced Coffee? <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ying</p>
<p>You have certainly had iced coffee, but do you know how many ways there are to make it? You will definitely say, "It's simple enough, there are two ways." Yes, two ways. One is to brew the coffee and put it in the refrigerator to chill. The other, if you don't have a refrigerator, is to let the coffee cool down first and then add a few ice cubes.</p>
<p>However, these are not good methods. Because coffee contains rich oils, putting it in the refrigerator to chill will cause the fatty substances to separate from the water, with fat particles floating on top and the liquid underneath becoming thin like water. So, the first method is not good. As for the second method, ice cubes are made of water, and adding ice cubes to coffee is like adding a large amount of ice water, diluting the rich coffee flavor, which is also not good.</p>
<p>The most scientific method is: first, brew the coffee extra strong (if you originally used one spoonful per cup, you need to use one and a half). Pour it into the refrigerator and freeze it into small cubic ice coffee cubes. When you want to drink it, just take out a few cubes and put them into a cup of hot coffee. You will immediately have a cup of rich and cold iced coffee!</p>
<h3 id="e91">Yellow-Green Sunglasses Are Most Beneficial to Human Eyes <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>According to Dr. [Blank], an associate professor of ophthalmology at New York University, the best sunglasses must be able to absorb ultraviolet rays and heat rays, and for general colored light, they must be able to absorb them partially and evenly, so that the proportion of natural colors will not change due to wearing sunglasses. According to experimental results, yellow-green sunglasses are most beneficial to the eyes and are recommended to the public by scientists.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to color, the lenses must also be carefully polished according to scientific principles. As for the fashion of wearing sunglasses, it should be limited to situations where the sunlight is intense. Wearing them at other times is not only useless but harmful.</p>
<p>A pair of eyes is the greatest treasure on the human body. Their structure is extremely delicate and requires special protection. In this scorching summer, ladies must pay extra attention when purchasing sunglasses.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Baked Alaska <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ying</p>
<p>The most common cold drink in summer is of course ice cream, a truly refreshing tonic for the spleen and stomach. But there is also the invention of "Baked Alaska," have you ever heard of it? The method of making "Baked Alaska" is as follows: take a piece of cake, cover it with ice cream, about half an inch thick. Then soak the surroundings in beaten egg whites. In this way, it can be placed in the oven to bake. After baking for about five minutes, take it out, and it is a serving of "Baked Alaska." Because of the separation of the egg whites, the ice cream inside is guaranteed not to melt.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Season of Floating Melons and Submerged Plums - A Discussion of Watermelons <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Beihai</p>
<p>The weather is hot, and watermelons are also on the market. The street vendors wiped their sweat while waving palm fans to drive away flies, shouting at the top of their lungs, "One hundred yuan for one watermelon!" In the alleys, watermelon vendors are constantly doing business at the back doors every day. On both sides of the road, large groups of flies buzz incessantly, circling on watermelon rinds. The sound of cicadas is noisy, truly the season of floating melons and submerged plums.</p>
<p>How much money will Shanghai people spend on watermelons this year? You may not believe it - according to the lowest estimate by people in the industry, it is 6 trillion yuan! Among them, Pinghu melons alone will be worth 3 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>First Crop Melons Are of Poor Quality</p>
<p>Early summer is the time when melons and fruits breed, but unexpectedly, this year's continuous rain has affected their growth. Therefore, although the first crop of watermelons this summer has been on the market, it is not as plentiful or of as good quality as in previous years. Due to the high cost of labor and transportation, the price per dan has reached about 40,000 yuan, and even the most ordinary ones require more than 20,000 yuan. Fortunately, Shanghai has plenty of wealthy customers, and the watermelons transported from the suburbs to Shanghai every day can be sold out completely.</p>
<p>As for the watermelons sold in Shanghai, the largest number each year is Pinghu melons. According to this year's lowest estimate, they are worth more than 3 trillion yuan. In the past, the watermelons grown in Pinghu were called "Three White Melons" - that is, white skin, white flesh, and white seeds, also called "Snow Flesh Watermelons." However, the "Three White Melons" are now outdated, and the "Potato Melons" have taken their place. It is said that this melon seed was passed down from Tanglou. The best Pinghu watermelons are produced outside the South Gate, and every one can be said to be sweet and delicious.</p>
<p>Judging Ripeness by Looking at the Skin Color</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Buy melons by looking at the skin color." In fact, "buying melons by looking at the skin color" can only identify its ripeness. Generally speaking, when a watermelon is ripe, its skin color is dark green, the pattern is clear, and the bottom skin color is yellow. If the melon skin is green and the bottom color is white, it means that it is not yet ripe. The thickness of the melon skin can also be determined by whether the melon skin is smooth or not. Therefore, from the farmers who plant the melons to the fruit merchants, they all rely on the skin color to assess its value.</p>
<p>Melon Vendors Make a Fortune</p>
<p>It is said that there are specialized melon vendors who specialize in looking at the skin color, and they can indeed make a fortune in the melon market every year. Their only skill is that seven or eight out of ten watermelons that they select can be guaranteed to be ripe just right, because overly ripe watermelons will turn into a loss. However, the value of these selected watermelons is also half higher than the market price. This higher price is the reward they get from experience. But to buy truly sweet watermelons, you still need to pay attention to where they come from, otherwise it is still unreliable.</p>
<p>Second Crop Melons Start to Hit the Market</p>
<p>The first crop of watermelons has been affected by the rain, and the sweetness is not enough, and they are prone to rot. However, the second crop of watermelons has begun to hit the market. So, to eat good melons, you just need to wait two or three days. In addition to Pinghu watermelons, Shanghai also has Bing melons produced in Sanlintang, which are also very famous. Next are the watermelons from Datuan in Pudong and Chongming. In addition, there are also many watermelons transported and sold from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. However, they are all classified as miscellaneous melons and are mostly sold in the North Market. According to estimates from the North and South markets, the total value of watermelon sales this year can reach 6 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>Hami Melon, the Supreme of Melons</p>
<p>In China, the best watermelons are produced in Hami, Xinjiang, and Dezhou, Shandong. As for Taiwan melons, they are only superficially good. As for the watermelons produced in the southern United States, they are huge, weighing more than 30 catties, but their sweetness is not as good as our Hami melons.</p>
<p>Eating watermelon in the hot summer can not only relieve the heat but also reduce the occurrence of sores and boils in children. It should be noted that it should not be eaten with greasy dishes. In addition, watermelon is also of great help in the treatment of typhoid fever caused by heat stroke. Therefore, every year when watermelons are on the market, some fruit merchants specially refrigerate them until winter before selling them.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Palm Trees, Miami Beach at Night: Dancing All Night Long, Gambling Rampantly, Over 150 Nightclubs <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mo</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, Miami Beach has once again resumed its crowded, lively scene this summer. In fact, in the 50-year history of Miami, it has never been as lively as it is this summer. Money is flying everywhere, and no one knows where so much money comes from. Perhaps the four years of war have created many nouveau riches, and these people don't seem to care about spending money at all. Five US dollars for a meal, a check for one thousand US dollars can only be used to pay for one hundred US dollars a week for rent. Chauffeurs earn two to three hundred dollars a week in tips, and ties sell for one thousand five hundred US dollars each.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this flood of money has four destinations: accommodation, department stores, food and drink, and gambling. Speaking of accommodation, it is absolutely impossible to find a place to stay in Miami today. If you want to take a nap in a chair in the hotel lobby, you have to pay a high price, and you have to see if you have connections. Because this year, groups of tourists have arrived by car, train, and plane, exceeding twice the original population of Miami, which is 250,000. Although hotel rooms are regulated to cost no more than 37.7 US dollars per day, in reality, they have already risen to 60 US dollars. After the rooms are all booked, many people have to rent a bench to sleep on or rent a platform on the roof.</p>
<p>The Office of Price Administration is truly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Two girls borrowed a floor to sleep on for one night, rent: 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Another person borrowed a woodshed in someone's backyard to sleep on for one night, rent: 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Families with empty rooms are asking for sky-high prices, because they don't want to rent them out.</p>
<p>But as a result, people immediately want them, without bargaining at all.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald sarcastically said that luckily, Miami law stipulates that you cannot spend the night in the toilet, otherwise, if the landlord rented the toilet to someone, one thousand US dollars a season, everyone would be scrambling for it.</p>
<p>Tourists who come to Miami, after playing for several nights in a row, say: The Miami night under the palm trees is truly a Lantern Festival every night. The 150 nightclubs there are packed every night, and no one complains about the price being too high.</p>
<p>Money came easily at first, and it goes easily now. On the gambling table, with a roll of the dice, ten or twenty thousand US dollars flows into someone else's pocket. People don't even raise an eyebrow, and no one takes it to heart.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Loneliness <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Shou</p>
<p>At dusk, I often walk to that hilltop and sit sadly under the shade of an old oak tree. My gaze casually falls on the plain below the mountain, watching the changing scenery there.</p>
<p>The Shana River nearby meanders, its waves surge, and its foam sparkles; it flows all the way into the distant darkness. The lake at the foot of the mountain, however, is still, a pool of sleeping water. Venus has already appeared in the blue sky above the lake.</p>
<p>The hilltops covered with dark green trees still have a last ray of light cast on them by the drooping sun. Then, the moon rises, whitening the horizon.</p>
<p>At this time, my gaze suddenly falls on the Gothic spire. The religious sounds overflowing from the church spread in the air. I stop walking and listen to the coarse bell, mixed in with the harmonious hymns, striking the last few tolls of the day.</p>
<p>But in the face of these gentle landscapes, my soul is indifferent, neither feeling tempted nor enthusiastic. I look down at the earth, like a wandering shadow. The lively sun can no longer warm the dead.</p>
<p>I look in vain at one hill after another, from south to north, from east to west, in every direction of this vast and boundless expanse. My moonlight fully surveys it. I can only say: "There is no place where happiness awaits me!"</p>
<p>Temptations have long flown past me. What do those small valleys, those mansions, those thatched huts have to do with me? In my eyes, they are nothing but empty things. River, rocks, forest, you are valuable things in the wilderness, but you lack a person, and everything becomes lifeless!</p>
<h3 id="e97">Each and Every One's Eden <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Whenever I see the stars on a summer night, I always remember a lovely place.</p>
<p>A gentleman once gave that place a strange name: "Each and Every One's Eden." I asked him with a smile what it meant, and he replied:</p>
<p>"Golgotha is the place where Jesus was crucified, called the Skull Place by the Jews, that is, the Place of Suffering. The Garden of Eden is the garden that God created for the first ancestors Adam and Eve, a carefree paradise. Well, 'Each and Every One's Eden,' what does this mean? You should know, right?"</p>
<p>"That gentleman seemed to be named Zhang, or maybe not, it's a little hazy now. But I still clearly remember that when he said these words to me, he was lying on a white iron bed filled with the smell of medicine. Next to the bed was a tea table with a vase of fresh flowers, two medicine jars, a thermometer, a teacup, and a glass straw for drinking boiled water.</p>
<p>A lonely hospital room, was that gentleman's "Eden"?</p>
<p>Naturally, it was more than that.</p>
<p>In the next small hospital room, on another white iron bed filled with the smell of medicine, lay a beautiful young lady. I didn't know her surname or given name, nor did I know where she came from, because she was very silent and very mysterious. But I could see that her illness was very serious, at least ten times more serious than mine, right? She couldn't get up and walk around and play like me. She coughed, had a fever, and constantly called out "Mommy" in a low voice.</p>
<p>However, every night, in the quiet, beautiful summer night, I often heard that young lady laughing softly.</p>
<p>Whether intentionally or unintentionally, I couldn't say myself. In any case, every evening, my feet would involuntarily wander to the outside of Mr. Zhang's and that young lady's room. There was a large balcony there. I leaned against a row of cement railings, looked up at the twinkling stars in the sky, and listened quietly to their conversation.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling better today? Did you finish your milk?" It was Mr. Zhang's voice.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling a bit better today, but I still can't drink the milk," the young lady replied softly.</p>
<p>"You're not listening to me again. You're not being good!"</p>
<p>The young lady didn't answer, but laughed softly. Ah! What a delicate laugh! "She's being coquettish," I thought. "Are they in love?" I thought again. So the next day, I went to Mr. Zhang's room and playfully teased him: "You're not listening to me again, you're not being good!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang smiled. Was it a bitter smile? No! It was a genuine laugh. "Don't tease me, you should be happy for me!" he once said to me.</p>
<p>Yes, I should be happy for him. But I couldn't forget that he was a man and that young lady was a woman. When a man and a woman are close, it's love. What is love? Isn't love a beautiful ladder? When climbing up this ladder, the only proper ending is marriage and bearing children. But they, a pair of patients on the verge of death, were also getting close, also in love. This was a bit too pointless! Did they also think about marriage and bearing children?</p>
<p>In my heart, a strong, thick wall stood tall. Inside this wall, although there weren't any indestructible old ethical stones, I couldn't deny that countless tiny traditional viewpoints, countless unconscious purely materialistic considerations, like a pile of tenacious mud and sand, had built this wall, blocking my sympathy and understanding for this poor couple, until one day, a very accidental day.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Zhang seemed to be in particularly good spirits. He was wearing a blue striped terry cloth bathrobe, leaning against the bed, holding a small white envelope in his hand, his eyes watching the door, waiting for someone to pass by. When he saw me, he called out to me:</p>
<p>"Thank you, would you do me a favor?"</p>
<p>I chuckled: "Are you asking me to be a matchmaker? Of course! But when are you inviting me to the wedding feast?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, he smiled, but this time, I saw very clearly that he was smiling bitterly, an extremely awkward bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Why do you laugh at us with such words?" He began to say to me quietly: "Do you think we've forgotten where we are? Do you think we're still dreaming empty worldly dreams? Alas! Why don't you reach out and feel our aching chests? Why don't you look at the heavy cross on our backs?..."</p>
<p>He took two breaths and continued:</p>
<p>"However, I don't think our actions are completely pointless. What is this world anyway? What is true, what is false, what is meaningful, what is meaningless? Let me tell you, when I wasn't sick, I was busy all day long, and I never thought about these things. But since I carried this heavy cross on my back, I felt that even though I am mortal, why can't I be like Christ, on the terrible Mount Golgotha, in the moment of darkness, still use a gentle voice to give a fellow sufferer some comfort and say: 'Today I will be with you in paradise!' My relationship with her is based on this wish. My wish, I have told you, is to find paradise in suffering, which is what I call 'Each and Every One's Eden.' Of course, this is not limited to small relationships between men and women."</p>
<p>He finished speaking, looking at me wearily. I was very surprised. How could a gentleman I had only known for a short time say such a thing to me? But I understood him, I sympathized with him, so I delivered the letter to that beautiful young lady next door. At the same time, I asked the young lady's name and learned that her surname was Mei, and her given name was Lifang.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and Miss Mei Lifang died on the same night three weeks later, only an hour apart.</p>
<p>When their bodies were wrapped in pure white sheets and carried out of the hospital room, the stars on the summer night were so beautiful and bright. I stood under the pure starlight and silently blessed them...</p>
<p>The above is not writing a novel, nor is it telling a story, but describing a true event I saw in a certain hospital six years ago.</p>
<p>Now I want to tell you why I am describing this event.</p>
<p>This is because not long ago, I published a novel. The plot in that novel was somewhat similar to the above event. So a friend wrote to me and said that in this turbulent era, novelists should be brave warriors, opening up great scenes and blowing magnificent trumpets! They should not be coy and shrink back into narrow corners, describing some sad and meaningless affairs between men and women.</p>
<p>Although I am not a novelist, I cannot help but thank that friend for his guidance. But I would also like to tell that friend that in this turbulent era, there are many brave warriors, but even more are people struggling in hunger and disease, approaching death! They carry heavy crosses on their backs, wandering on the terrible Mount Golgotha, in pain, in despair, happiness has forgotten them, the world has forgotten them; but I cannot forget them, because I myself am one of them. Therefore, I know that my words will be seen by brave warriors, but I hope they will not be abandoned by a group of poor fellow sufferers, and I hope they can understand my purpose, which can also be said to be my wish, which is what Mr. Zhang said: to find paradise in suffering! To build "Each and Every One's Eden!" Of course, this is not limited to small relationships between men and women.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Liu Ziyun's hometown was Wuhan, so she also used the excuse of escaping the war, resigned from her position at the girls' school, and decided to go with Lihua.</p>
<p>Regarding Liu Ziyun's going to Wuhan together, Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian did not object either, because they knew that Liu Ziyun was from a famous family in Wuhan, and had considerable influence in the area. They wanted to use Liu Ziyun to open up relationships in this new environment, so they were willing to travel with her. Furthermore, they knew that Dong Shaoling was not going to Wuhan, and without Dong Shaoling, they had fewer concerns. Therefore, they welcomed Liu Ziyun's company even more. Their view of Liu Ziyun was: as long as Dong Shaoling was not around, no matter how close Liu Ziyun got to Lihua, it was not enough to threaten them. Because Liu Ziyun was ultimately a woman, and there was no danger in women liking women.</p>
<p>Lihua felt a serious pain because of her separation from Dong Shaoling! Although Liu Ziyun comforted her: Dong Shaoling would soon go to Wuhan anyway, and there was no need to take the temporary separation to heart. But Lihua couldn't help but feel vaguely sad! She thought: even for two or three days of not seeing each other, she felt empty as if she had lost something, and now she was going to be apart for many days, even months. Wasn't she going to be even more empty? Therefore, her heart began to feel a new kind of awkward worry! Her spirit also began to fall into a dazed, confused mood!</p>
<p>On the eve of their departure, Lihua, behind the backs of Mrs. Mo, Zhang Xian, Liyun, and Liu Ziyun, mustered up the courage to quietly run to the girls' school, found Dong Shaoling's dormitory, stood at the door, without shouting, nor walking in. In the silence of the darkness, her heart was filled with shy, fearful, anxious, and restless waves! For a long time, she slowly stepped forward.</p>

<p>The famous domestic violinist Ma Sicong went to Taiwan to perform and spend the summer a week ago. It is said that he can return to Shanghai in two months. It is also said that a symphony orchestra in Taiwan intends to invite Mr. Ma to be its conductor.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Association recently plans to hold a "Record Concert" on a regular basis every week in the Nanyang Garden. According to the Association, record concerts are educationally meaningful and have long been popular in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>The Municipal Symphony Orchestra, formerly known as the "Municipal Council Orchestra," experienced considerable difficulties due to funding issues after its restoration. It is now temporarily funded by the municipal government with 20 million yuan per month. The musicians receive approximately 300,000 yuan per month each, and they regularly rehearse and perform. The performance times are every Wednesday and Saturday, and the location is at the Yihui Hall.</p>
<p>The former Municipal Council Orchestra improved Shanghai's musical standards and introduced orthodox Western music to Shanghai audiences. Now the Municipal Orchestra will also have greater tasks and contributions.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Problems of the 20th Century <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Commonplace</p>
<p>Two months ago, The Commercial Press published a translation by Zhu Baoxian, entitled "The Problems of the 20th Century." It was written by Lord Davies ten years after the League of Nations was established, dating back seven or eight years now. The targets of his criticism seem to have become a thing of the past. However, the "how to reduce the causes of war" discussed in the book is indeed the most serious and pressing major problem of the 20th century. This problem has not yet been solved and still requires people to work hard to solve it. This book proposes concrete scientific solutions, which are of great help to solving this problem. It is still worth discussing carefully. Now, I will first briefly introduce the contents of the book, and then add my own opinions on this issue.</p>
<p>Avoiding War</p>
<p>The book consists of twenty-one chapters. It first states that "avoiding war depends on the League of Nations to uphold fairness; disarmament will not succeed, and fairness cannot be implemented; disarmament depends on the establishment of security guarantees." Therefore, it advocates that "international police must be organized using scientific methods." It proves this with the history of the Greek city-state league, the Great Harmony Plan of Sully, Saint Pierre, and others. Such an organization is not only necessary but also achievable. Unfortunately, the gentlemen who drafted the League of Nations Charter at the time were mostly constrained by traditional concepts such as "national sovereignty," "absolute right of self-defense," and "competitive nature." They only perfunctorily followed the "Hurst-Miller draft" and completely rejected the proposal of the French representative Bourgeois to organize an international police force. Even the proposal to organize a permanent body to discuss such issues was rejected. As a result, the League of Nations became a hollow discussion forum. Although there was an International Court of Justice and an Arbitration Tribunal, the Executive Council had no power to enforce its judgments or rulings. As a result, international security remained non-existent. Not only could disarmament not be achieved, but the arms race was even more intense than before 1914. Next, it refutes the fallacies of the absolute "national sovereignty" and "absolute right of self-defense." It argues that national sovereignty and the right of self-defense are only relative, not absolute, in the international arena. Competition between countries, like various domestic competitions, must be subject to the restriction of rules, otherwise it will lead itself to destruction. Next, it extends Hobbes' "contract theory" to explain international relations, first amending the Covenant of the League of Nations to make the League of Nations a rudimentary confederation. The Executive Council should be reorganized by representatives from the five or seven major powers together with four smaller countries to preside over the committee, exercising international police control to make it a servant of fairness and a protector of international society. By applying domestic private law to international public law, the international arena will become a rule of law. Force will only be used to maintain fairness and punish contracting states or aggressor states. Surplus force will naturally be reduced without the need for disarmament.</p>
<p>International Police Force</p>
<p>The organization of the international police force is based on the "principle of weapon allocation." It is divided into two phases. The first phase is a trial period of twenty-five years. Those who wish to withdraw from the organization during this period must notify three years in advance. The armed forces of all member states are divided into three categories: (1) "City Police Force," equipped with batons, swords, and pistols; (2) "National Police Force," equipped with rifles, machine guns, cannons, and old-fashioned warships from before 1914, to maintain domestic security; (3) "International Police Force," which, in addition to temporarily requisitioning the national police forces of member states, also forms an "International Special Forces," equipped with newly invented aircraft, submarines, poison gas, and tanks after 1914. It is also agreed that all new weapons invented by member states in the future must be reported and used by the International Special Forces, with severe punishment for violations, to ensure that the international police force enjoys weapon superiority. Weapons, except for self-made aircraft, are purchased or leased from member states. Soldiers and officers are also borrowed from member states. However, the Commander-in-Chief and the four commanders of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Poison Gas are elected by various powers on a rotation basis, jointly forming the General Staff, maintaining close contact with the general staffs of various member states on a regular basis. Peacetime expenses are shared by members according to the proportion of the League of Nations' annual fees. In wartime, all expenses are taken from the contracting state or aggressor state. The headquarters is located in Palestine, and the mainland stations and branch station military bases are selected for lease in four types of territories: mandated territories, neutral zones, important military locations, and small countries. At the end of the trial period, the weapons of the second phase are entirely self-made, and the soldiers and officers are entirely recruited and appointed by themselves. The apportionment of maintenance costs for their bases remains the same. During this period, member states wishing to withdraw from the organization must notify ten years in advance for it to take effect.</p>
<p>This method, although it cannot eliminate war, at least changes the nature of war. Although it cannot disarm immediately, the arms race can at least be stopped and hopefully gradually reduced. Although there are some shortcomings in the technical aspects of the organization that are too accommodating to nationalism, which are inevitable and still need to be discussed by experts, it has changed the concept of absolute sovereignty to a better one; the concept of absolute right of self-defense to one of mutual assistance; and the concept of competition to a spirit of cooperation. Psychologically, this is a great progress. If the League of Nations had adopted this plan that year, World War II might not have occurred. Now, after World War II, the United Nations has been established, with a conference of chiefs of staff of various member states attached to discuss issues such as international police. Prominent figures such as Einstein are also loudly advocating for it. If this method is carefully adopted by the United Nations, the so-called problem of the twentieth century cannot be said to be completely solved, but at least there is a way to solve it.</p>
<p>The Current Situation</p>
<p>But, looking at the current international situation where there is no mutual trust, is this method feasible? I cannot help but doubt.</p>
<p>First: The "contract theory" was originally a hypothesis of public law scholars and civil rights theorists, with no basis in history. According to the enlightenment of sociology, the people's surrender of the right of self-defense to be exercised by society on their behalf was originally forced by the so-called sovereign at the time—the chieftain or monarch—to maintain the治安秩序 within the territory. It was not out of volition. It later evolved into a judicial system. At the end of the Middle Ages, some scholars fabricated the contract theory to explain this phenomenon in order to promote civil rights and humanitarianism. However, experience always surpasses theory in governing human behavior. Today, the international arena is still in a state of anarchy. Who is the new sovereign? Who dares to assume the role of the king? Who can force whom to surrender the right of self-defense, and who is willing to automatically surrender the right of self-defense without a definite security guarantee?</p>
<p>Second: Examining the establishment process of various federations or confederations, they all have special historical backgrounds. The ancient Greek alliance was led by Athens and Sparta alternately. Modern examples such as the Swiss Confederation were due to united resistance against enemy countries. The Soviet Union and Germany were driven by a strong state. The United Kingdom of Great Britain was even due to the evolution of the empire. In short, it is not due to external coercion, but to internal coercion. Who is the coercer in the current international arena? Although it is said that if there is another world war, human civilization will be destroyed, which can force countries to unite peacefully. However, human actions always prioritize emotion over reason, and it is always easy to share adversity but difficult to share prosperity. You don't need to look far at ancient history, just look at the current US and Soviet Union as an example. They used to join hands to resist the Axis powers, how loving they were. They have all tasted the pain of World War II, which was fiercer than the first. If there is a third one, with the addition of atomic bombs, it will be much fiercer than the second. Logically, they should unite. However, once the ceasefire, they argued and refused to yield, as if forgetting the past and disregarding the future. It also seems that because they care about the future, they are arguing even more fiercely. Some people say that this is a struggle between democracy and socialism. I am afraid that this is still a superficial façade, and the "competitive impulse" is probably still at play in its bones. How can such a confederation be formed? Even if it is reluctantly formed, without a center capable of promoting it, it will be useless, just like the League of Nations in the past, which was centered on Britain and France. Britain and France could not cooperate, which led to the collapse of the League of Nations and triggered World War II. I think everyone remembers this short history of more than twenty years. The ancients said: "One pond cannot hold two dragons, one nest cannot hold two heroes." Unexpectedly, these words are still useful today. Human progress is truly pitiful!</p>
<p>Third: Military science progresses by leaps and bounds, and new weapons are invented endlessly. How can an international authority always maintain weapon superiority? According to reports, the United States has now invented "germ warfare." One ounce of botulinum toxin can poison 200 million people. The cost is only one-fortieth of that of an atomic bomb, but its effectiveness is thousands of times higher than that of an atomic bomb. Even poison gas cannot catch up with it. Manufacturing does not require a large factory, just a laboratory or distillation room is enough. The current international covenants are unreliable. Suppose one of the countries harbors ambitions or is dissatisfied with this "great nation" and "supreme force," it only surrenders the new weapons known to the international community, and keeps the new inventions of the germ category secret for its own use. I would like to ask what methods can be used to stop it? Strict inspection? I am afraid that excessive interference will easily cause rifts. Moreover, it is not easy to inspect. I would like to ask what methods the international police force has to maintain its advantage at all times?</p>
<p>It is a Psychological Problem</p>
<p>I am raising these questions not out of pessimism, but to draw everyone's attention to a deeper level. The so-called "problem of the 20th century is a psychological problem" and cannot be solved solely by organizing some strong force. Organization can indeed affect psychology, but improving psychology is ultimately a prerequisite for solving this problem. European culture, since Greece, has benefited greatly from analysis and struggle. After Darwin and others invented the law of evolution of survival of the fittest, they applied the "law of the jungle" of the biological world to all aspects of human social life. Everything is done with a spirit of struggle. The names of struggles emerge endlessly, and even religious groups that advocate cosmopolitanism struggle. Although Kropotkin and others promoted "mutual aid" to save this madness, the environment they created always made them feel that mutual aid is only for internal use, and struggle is still necessary for external use. Everyone knows that now that transportation is developed, the world has developed into a large and boundless whole. Some people also know that the world is a whole, and peace is indivisible, so they want to use violence to conquer the whole world. According to Mencius's theory that "the world is settled in one," there is also a reason, but we must also know that Mencius said "those who do not like to kill can" and "those who subdue people with virtue are kings, and those who use force to pretend to be benevolent are hegemons." Subduing people with force is not as good as subduing people with virtue. Subduing people with force, even if it does not follow in Hitler's footsteps, is only hegemony. Why not go a step further and seek to be the king that the world belongs to? Don't say that humans are the same as other creatures! Humans are ultimately different from animals: they have reason and morality, and there are ways to coexist and prosper in this large and boundless circle. What is the method? That is to strive to promote the "Doctrine of the Mean" taught by Chinese Confucianism and correct the traditional outlook on life of Europeans and Americans: from "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" to "those who use great things to serve the small ones are happy." The so-called problem of the 20th century will not become a problem. Even if there is a problem, it is not difficult to solve it. Now the United Nations has an attached Scientific, Educational and Cultural Commission, which also seems to see the importance of international education. However, looking at their declaration charter, they only plan for cultural exchange and cultural cooperation, and have not found a guiding principle that meets the needs of the times to do their central work. I hope everyone will pay attention to this point.</p>

<p>— Zhou Ping</p>
<p>The seventh English edition of the China Yearbook, published by the Liberty Tribune, has been published. The content includes all major events in China in the years 1944 and 1945. As the name "Yearbook" implies, it is published once a year, but according to the editor's statement, due to the shortage of paper and the difficulty of collecting statistical data during the war, it had to be published as a combined two-year edition. The chief editor is Cao Wenyan, the consultant is Qian Qian Shu, and the writers are 　jia or heads of various departments. The content is divided into eight parts: (1) General Theory, which discusses China's geography, astronomy, population, climate, history, philosophy, literature and language; (2) Political Parties and Politics, which includes Sun Ke's statement of Mr. Zhongshan's political philosophy, Pan Gongzhan's explanation of the status of the Kuomintang and the National Government, and Shao Lizi's report on the process of the Senate; (3) The Organization of the National Government, which includes the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, as well as the affairs of the Interior, Mongolia and Tibet, and overseas Chinese; (4) Military Affairs, which includes Chen Cheng's discussion of military affairs, Zhou Zhirou's explanation of the Chinese Air Force, and the situation on various Chinese battlefields, and finally mentions Japan's unconditional surrender and China's acceptance of the surrender; (5) China's Relationship with the World, which explains various international conferences and China's diplomatic situation; (6) Finance and Economy, which discusses China's finance, banks, currency, foreign trade, domestic industrial development, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, grain and other issues; (7) Culture and Social Work, which discusses education, research, publishing, religion and various educational and economic undertakings; (8) A chronicle of major events in the past two years.</p>
<p>The book has a total of 1164 pages. It is truly a miracle that such a large book can be published in China during the war, and it also shows the country's emphasis on cultural undertakings. The printing and binding of this book are very exquisite, and some articles are also written very beautifully. From this book, you can see the progress of China during the war, and it can also be said to be a very complete historical material of China in the past two years. However, there are three points that we would also like to raise with the editor for discussion. First, we feel that some articles are slightly formulaic, seemingly official documents, and not deep enough into the people. It is not intimate. Second, the whole book focuses on planar narration and fails to fully explain the development of China in various aspects in the past two years. For example, the book talks about national philosophy and literature but does not mention any changes in the past two years. Also, the political dynamics of the past two years are not clearly and thoroughly explained. We believe that from the perspective of explaining the developments in recent years, only the sixth department's chapters on financial and economic development are relatively satisfactory. Third, we believe that there are still some omissions in this book. For example, the doctrines and activities of various parties and factions are hardly mentioned, the cultural movement is not clearly portrayed, and the religious undertakings of Islam and Buddhism are not mentioned at all. We hope that the editors will pay attention to the above three points when editing the eighth issue.</p>

<p>A country child came to Shanghai, took a circle around Nanjing Road, and came back shouting with a headache, and slept on the bed for a full day before returning to normal. Adults are actually a little difficult to support, but the resistance to stimulation is different.</p>
<p>I often see a child who grows up in the city, sometimes sitting there in a daze, wondering what he is thinking about. He is only about ten years old, a kind of precocious and thoughtful state. I don't know whether to be happy or sad?</p>
<p>The burden on people's brains now is heavy enough, and science seems to have no way to test what a brain nerve should manage, and what the brain can store...</p>
<p>Let me give you a small question, dear reader, have you ever counted how many numbers you have recorded in your brain? If you write them down one by one, wouldn't it surprise you? For example, the house number of your residence, telephone number, shirt size, salary amount, family age, birthday, number of newspapers, appointments with friends, check number, debt dealings,... all are numbers, and these numbers are increasing day by day with your social relationships.</p>
<p>The item of numbers alone is enough to make a person dizzy. I have tried to ask several friends (including myself) about the main postal debts, such as express mail, registration, airmail, domestic and foreign. As a result, no one can answer.</p>
<p>Not only are the numbers gradually increasing, but they are also changing every day. Rice prices are something that everyone is concerned about. The rise and fall in the past month has cost us a lot of brain cells, not to mention the "烚赤哪美鈔哪" (untranslatable slang)!</p>
<p>Numbers don't count, good heavens! There are countless "things"! These things are not as tangible and mechanical as numbers, and can be simply memorized. Tell me, modern people, modern people living in the city, can they live long?</p>
<p>At first, I really didn't understand why various tonics and supplements are so popular in the city, and why memory decline and insomnia are so common. It turns out that city people are too willing to worry about their brains. They can recite the time of the insomnia programs on a certain radio station and the showtimes of a certain movie theater. How can they blame their brains for not being up to par?</p>

<p>— Yi Ji</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu launched a large-scale offensive. In addition to increasing the main force, they also forcibly recruited people from various villages to serve as vanguards and cannon fodder. The young and strong men in various villages fled one after another. A party member forcibly recruited a farmer.</p>
<p>The farmer said: "I am fifty-two years old. Can I be exempted?"</p>
<p>"Your body is still strong, so carry things for us!"</p>
<p>"I can't jump, I can't walk far, forgive me!"</p>
<p>"If you can't carry things, come with us to attack. It's good to strengthen the momentum. On the battlefield, one more person will make the enemy see one more black spot."</p>
<p>This party member was considered naive, and did not use their usual deception tricks, and directly pulled the farmer to be a small black spot. Of course, the small black spot that was pulled was not just that middle-aged farmer, but also many other black spots. These black spots sacrificed themselves for the Communist Party.</p>
<p>People in northern Jiangsu with more assets are guilty because they have wealth. They are "fleeing in fear of crime." Young and strong people without assets are afraid of being small black spots on the battlefield, so they have to flee. Therefore, refugees are everywhere in southern Jiangsu!</p>
<p>A big landlord, in order to preserve his family property, flattered the Communist Party. The county-level party members knew that he was insincere, but believed that it could be used as propaganda material, so they praised him as an "enlightened gentleman," appointed him as a senator, and gave him some small conveniences. Middle-level people looked askance and often said that the "big landlord" was opening his mind. When he went to the countryside to collect rent, the township-level cadres surrounded him and insulted him, and sometimes wanted to tie him up and throw him into the Yangtze River. When he reported to the county-level party members, they would give him some comfort and sometimes intercede with the township-level cadres to solve some minor problems. Now that the Communist Party is 　窮七見(impoverished and desperate), they no longer perfunctorily treat these people. The big landlord's fields have been divided up, and he has to flee. If he doesn't flee, he might really be sent to the Yangtze River to see the Sea Dragon King.</p>
<p>The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have been dragging on for a long time. The Communist Party is doing its best to plunder and oppress in northern Jiangsu. The people are suffering terribly, but the Communist Party's ugly face has also been exposed a lot. In the past, when we talked about the strange phenomena in the liberated areas to people in southern Jiangsu, people generally thought that we were telling myths. Now they should understand. Alas! Who doesn't love their hometown? Why do tens of thousands of refugees flee? There can't be so many fools in the world. They would never flee and become refugees unless they had suffered all kinds of hardships!</p>

<h3 id="e106">Dedicated to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (10)(7) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>I remember the time when we were taking refuge from the bandits in Nanping Mountain Village in Anhui. Because I deeply missed our deceased son Rong, I once wrote a Ci poem called "Dian Jiang Chun": "Graceful soul, spring comes, traces all over the empty mountain road, clouds in the valley protect. There is the grave of my deceased son. Sleeping alone underground, with whom does he speak in loneliness? Do not be afraid! Plant some plum trees. Good companions living together." Thinking of this poem, I also thought of the old saying "peace after burial." During the second seven-day period after your death, I discussed it with Bao Mei and others, and we all thought it would be good to bury you within the seven-week period, so that you could accompany our deceased son, and neither of you would be lonely. Therefore, I entrusted the undertaker at the funeral home to transport your coffin to the Guta Cemetery under the mountain in advance. At the same time, I contacted Mr. Jiang Zhongchuan and Mr. Chen Weiyin, who were in charge of the cemetery, and finalized the arrangements. On the 29th, at 7 a.m. before the seventh seven-day period, I, along with Bao Mei, Shi Jing, Zheng Er, and Mei Er, a group of five people, took a boat to Linggu to bury you. That day, it suddenly started raining again, arousing endless sorrow and confusion in me. Fortunately, Rong's tomb, although it had gone through a great calamity, was still intact, and the tombstone was still standing upright, with the posthumous photo in his Boy Scout uniform embedded on the front, full of vigor. The inscription by Mr. Huhu on the back was also clearly readable. Fortunately, your tomb had already been dug in advance, and the procedures were very simple. Taking advantage of the temporary break in the rain, we buried you. The weeping of Bao Mei and Mei Er echoed the sound of the earthworkers shoveling soil, striking my heart one after another, crumbling like clods of earth. Alas, wind! From now on, Rong will be protected under your loving care and will not be afraid. And you, having this child to please you, will surely not feel lonely at night. But since I lost you, my lonely shadow is desolate, and this loss is irreplaceable!</p>
<p>After the news of your death spread, relatives and friends in Shanghai were very shocked and grieved. They sent letters of condolence one after another, and gave generous gifts, all advising me to take a detached view, and to find solace for myself. The lines from my brother-in-law Yiyi, "Though life and death are different, affection between relatives remains the same," gave me the greatest comfort, knowing that my love is boundless. The senior Mr. Shushu had broken his strings three times and had been through similar experiences. He specially wrote a pair of elegiac couplets: "With thoughts of the old garden, follow your husband back to seclusion, willing to choose a nearby place to live until old age." "Autumn dreams filled with European waves, reading Yuanzhen's elegiac poems, feeling the sympathy of those who have suffered the same illness." Sharing the same sorrow can alleviate some of my grief. My literary friend Mao Yuman also sent a scroll of elegiac poems, which are two heptasyllabic poems: "Purple orchids wither, willow catkins droop, white stones and clear springs move in the small calamity; silver candle shadows mournfully hang, pearl curtains faintly recite posthumous poems; moths suddenly break out of the same palace, phoenixes leave empty nests to face the sun; after finishing the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, doubled sadness, in the human world and in heaven, love always remains." "Piles of old books stir up deep sorrow, under the flowers, the father-in-law speaks of painting eyebrows; paper leaves and lotus flowers communicate the wonderful Dharma, red lessons are ordered at the window next to the bamboo fence to write new poems. The elegance of pulling out a hairpin hangs on the red bamboo brush, raising the tray with a smile, the music blends with the zither silk; realizing that humans and heaven are originally one breath, the six likenesses of bubbles and illusions are unbearable to hold." Elegant and mournful, they are truly excellent words. However, to compare you to a talented woman, you would be ashamed to accept. But if I say you are a typical good wife and loving mother, then you can accept it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Gleanings in Brief</p>
<h3 id="e107">Enemy and Puppet Materials Are Molding Away; No Date Set for Sealing and Sale <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Zeng Guofan's diary records: "Minister Luo Yin served as an official in the provinces of Zhili, Hubei, and Zhejiang for a total of twenty-five years. His family did not have a single humble dwelling, and he only sent three hundred taels of silver home. His wife never wore a fur coat her whole life, truly the first honest official of the day." If it were today, then people would certainly ridicule Mr. Luo's style, and for the wife of an official not to wear a fur coat her whole life, is truly a pity.</p>
<p>It is estimated that four-fifths of school-age children in Beiping are out of school. In Ningbo and other places, enemy and puppet period textbooks are still being sold and used for enslavement education. In Shanghai, amidst the movement to respect teachers, a school principal was found to have raped a female student. Who would have expected such a thing?</p>
<p>Enemy and puppet materials are sealed in warehouses, left to mold and rot. Even if they were immediately unsealed and sold, they would be sold at a great discount. At the same time, warehouse rent has increased, and as a result, enemy and puppet materials cannot be moved out, making it impossible for them to continue operating, causing great distress. I don't know what benefit the authorities see in "hoarding" so many enemy and puppet materials?</p>
<p>I hailed a rickshaw at the intersection of Pentang Lane and Nanjing Road to go to Dixiwei Road. He asked for twenty yuan. I asked if it could be cheaper. The rickshaw puller gave me a cold look and said, "If you want cheaper, you can take the tram." I don't hate him for speaking so harshly, but I blame the tram company for allocating so few trams to that route.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Please Take a Look at Northern Jiangsu! No Sincerity, Only Deceit; No Love, Only Hate; "Democracy" on Their Lips, "Despotism" in Their Hearts! <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>People are dissatisfied with the reality, and so they yearn for vague things. This is human nature. That is why many people who like to talk about politics and have not tasted the flavor of the Communists have a good impression of the Communist side. But in many places in northern Jiangsu, we have been under the rule of Yan'an for seven years. Tears have run dry for seven years. I hope that people from the Democratic League will quietly come to northern Jiangsu as ordinary citizens and stay for a few days to see what it's like. Will they embrace and weep with the suffering compatriots!</p>
<p>Some people say that the Communist Party is not a party, but a religion. Our experience of the past seven years has made us feel that this is absolutely true. The words, actions, treatment of people, and handling of things by party members are all the same as those of religious followers. They are always the same routine. Once inside, they lose their reason and blindly follow the party's orders.</p>
<p>Communist Party members are all extremely radicalized people. They have strong organizational skills and do things thoroughly. This is what moves people. They have such power because of these abilities. When officials do things, they consider it done after completing six or seven tenths of the task. When they do it, it's not twelve tenths, but twenty-four tenths, so the people suffer twelve tenths.</p>
<p>Radicalized people are too enthusiastic about doing things. They always pay attention to everything the common people eat and say. If it doesn't suit their will, there is danger. Therefore, the people in the liberated areas always feel that they are being monitored all the time, and there is a possibility of danger happening anytime and anywhere, so they cannot help but flee.</p>
<p>Some people say: "The Communist Party members' dictionary does not have the word "sincerity," only the word "deceit," no word of "love," only the word of "hate." "Democracy" is on their lips, "despotism" is in their hearts." Our observations over the past seven years have made us feel that these words are not wrong at all.</p>
<p>They also have no laws. They also claim to have a three-trial system, but the court rarely opens trials. Everything is handled by township and district cadres. Lower-level cadres only have preconceived notions and no legal principles. The relatively poor are always victorious. In the dilapidated countryside, where do you find the bourgeoisie? A hard-working person who has a little savings is often tricked by unemployed poor people. Now hard-working people are not happy to work hard to farm the land. If the harvest is good, people will pay attention, and they will be bullied, and there will be danger.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Swimming Is Also a Problem <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinxiang</p>
<p>Currently, only the Hongkou public swimming pool is open in Shanghai. Therefore, although the ticket price is high, the pool is still often full, and there is a constant stream of swimmers, even more prosperous than in previous years.</p>
<p>Originally, swimming is an excellent form of exercise, which is of great benefit to human health. When summer arrives, young men and women who love swimming want to immerse themselves in the clear pool water to pass the hot summer.</p>
<p>But this year it is unlikely.</p>
<p>(1) High ticket prices—definitely not something that ordinary commoners can often afford.</p>
<p>(2) The journey—how much time do you think it would take for commoners living in the French Concession or Nanshi to go to the Hongkou swimming pool? Transportation is so inconvenient.</p>
<p>(3) Too many swimmers—the small Hongkou swimming pool is crowded with one or two hundred people, and then they become like sardines, bumping into each other. Some people get hurt, some people get kicked. This is what most swimmers find most troublesome and very annoying!</p>
