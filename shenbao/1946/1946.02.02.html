<h3 id="c10">政協會議圓滿閉幕 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>政治協商會議自上月十日召開，歷時二十二日，業於三十一晚八時半圓滿開幕。這二十二天來，全國人民對政治協商會議的進行，關注彌殷：在各方一致的一只許成功，不許失敗」的呼號下，現在政治協商會議能够成立重要協議，圓滿閉幕，這眞是從日寇投降抗　勝利以來惟一令人興奮欣慰的事。在這二十多天的會議過程中，各方能够相忍相讓，使會議能在和諧協調的氛圍下順利進行，可見各方如何能夠爲了顧全大局，捐棄私見。這種協調精神，實在值得慶倖幸。中國人已在經過長期戰爭以後，亟需有一個機會能够稍資蘇息，以圓復興。日寇投降抗戰勝利是個好消息，這使他們明瞭中國民族爲了爭取民族自由與日本作的殊死戰已勝利地結束了。這使他們興奮。但曾幾何時，他們這種興奮叉爲國內實際政治問題上的陰影而消散；所以他們對於爲消除這些政治上的陰影而召開的政治協商會議寄予熱烈的期望，希望協商之能有結果，中國的人民能够有一個生聚休養的機會·政治協商會議之所以能够結果圓滿，我們不得不歸功於參加政協諸公以國家民族爲重，人民利益爲重，而捐棄了私見。在我們正預備實施憲政的今日，這種相忍相讓的民主作風，尤其値得我們的稱頌。</p>
<p>政治協商會議所成立的協議計有五端：一爲關於政府組織，一爲關於施政綱領，一爲關於軍事問題，一爲關於國民大會？一爲關於憲法革案。就所成立的協議來看，都能於尊重國家體制之中，顧全客觀的事實。如關於政府組織所成立的協議爲加強國民政府委員會的權力，調整國府委員的組織，增加委員名額至四十人，其中半數由國民黨員充任，半數由非國民黨人員充任，及於行政院下設置政務委員等，均係就現行政治體制爲適當的調整。這一調整，一方面固爲可以滿足各黨各派得以實際參政的願望，一方面亦足以償國民黨天下爲公的宿願，同時，亦足以不負我們盟邦對支持一個强大統一而民主的中國的盛情。</p>
<p>此外，關於國民大會的召開，原亦爲會議過程中爭論之一焦點。今番所成立之協議，使國民大會得以如期召開，政府威信，因以維持；同時爲適應目今局勢，擴大代表名額，使各黨各派及社會賢達得以儘量參加，要亦不失爲一種睿智的決定·其餘各施政綱領，軍事問題，憲法草案亦均能本相忍相讓的協調精神而有所決定。當前的若干政治問題，經此次政治協商會議諸公約努力，應已不再存在。我們顯這些協約，不僅是一種書面文章，不僅是局部有效，必將本成立協議的精神，忠實而普徧的執行。觀乎這次協商會議能够順利進行，圓滿結束，我們深信這些協議必將忠實執行，必將推行於全國各地，決不會成爲不兌現的支票的。</p>
<p>然而論到政協所成立的各項協議的重要，實無逾於建國施政綱領。其它各政府組織軍事問題憲法草案等協議，可以說都以建國施政綱領爲基本的中心。這是一種繼往開來的轉捩點。此一綱領旣由此次參加政協約各黨各派及社會賢達所共同制定，當是今後和平建國的準備，與抗戰時期中的「抗戰建國綱領相同。在蔣主席對政協所致的閉幕詞上，我們看見主席說：「本人認爲各案之中要稱和平建國綱領爲各種方案的基本之中心，因爲此案從甲總則，乙人民權利，丙政治，丁軍事，戊外交，己經濟及財政，庚敎育及文化，辛善後救濟，壬僑務等九章的各條規定，均屬異常完備，確合時代要求，充滿了統一性，充滿了民主性，實在是渡到憲政時期最適官的綱領。我們有了這個綱領，由中央以至全國各地方政府，由各黨各派與社會領導人士，以至全國各地的同胞，都有了共同運守的準則，尤其參加本會議的各黨各派對於這個綱領，旣是大家共同商討。共同議定，而且就要參加政府來共同執行。」可見建國施政綱領的制定，在現階段的政治局勢下，關係如何的重要。</p>
<p>誠如蔣主席在政協閉會詞所說，這個綱領旣由參加　協約各黨各派暨社會賢達所共同制定，是此綱領必同樣地適用於中共軍隊的駐在區內。在中共駐在區內亦應「確保人民享有身體，思想，宗敎，信仰，言論，出版，集會，結社，居住，遷徒通訊之自由」。同時，今後政黨旣可公開活動，決不容再有使用武裝暴動或在各地秘密組織的行爲。就中電隊國家化一點，旣有此和平建國綱領的規定，尤須切實執行。所有全國軍隊，不分黨派，不分地區，都應聽命政府的指揮，以達到軍令軍政和軍政航一的標準。</p>
<p>政協圓滿閉幕，適在舊曆除夕的前夜，「爆竹一聲除舊」，以前種種，願隨爆竹之　以俱逝。此後春回大地，也正是我們政治上除舊布新千載一時的良機。政黨政治又重將在中國出現，願自民元以來所有政黨過去一切不良的現象，能隨舊歲以俱去；允願中國能在公認三民主義爲建國的最高原則下，日趨强面統一與民主。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播稱：安全理事會今日下午開會討論蘇聯所提出關於反對英軍留駐希臘之申訴，在開會時，該會准許希臘代表一名入塲就座，旋由蘇聯代表維辛斯基發表演說，據稱：蘇聯此次提出申訴，並非意外之事，在此以前，蘇聯曾與盟國提出希臘問題凡三次，最後一次係在三强外長在莫斯科會議之時，當時，蘇方亦將該問題提出討論，惜無結果，至目前發報時爲止，該項安全理事會，仍在繼續開會中。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕安全理事會甫於星期三討論伊朗申訴案，今日開會時，常討論希臘間題，審查蘇聯之控英軍駐在希臘有危和平及安全。挪威外長黎埃由安全理事會舉薦爲聯合國秘書長，可於今日之全體大會中批准，經濟安全兩理事會及託治委員會，均將於今日開會，故今日乃工作繁重之一日。此外控制聯合國軍之軍事參謀委員會，亦定今日開會，惟尚未正式宣布，蘇聯代表不知是否得以及時趕到，否則延期當不能免。</p>

<p>〔路透社盤谷一日電〕暹邏王馬希杜昨晨授命頗孚衆望之民主黨領袖顯恩，出任暹邏新首相。顧恩之名，乃國民大會週三辯論後由議院議長向暹王推薦者。新首相昨日聲稱，渠希望暹邏不久可成聯合國之會員國。一九四一年暹邏自越南併吞土地而與法方起爭執，今暹邏歡迎英美協助決定此事，如果在此爭執區內舉行公民投票，則渠預料將投票贊成併入暹邏。關於英暹條約，渠糾國民大會中將有「激烈辯論」。查顧恩係暹人，但來自柬埔寨，即法屬越南四保護區之一，該區有大部份已被暹邏併吞。前暹邏首相榮格蘭之獨裁制，於一九四四年八月傾覆後，顧恩曾一度繼之出任首相，至去歲八月爲止。此次顧恩就任之前，曾有五日之政治動盪局面，當時爲各方贊同之候選人，均不願接受此職。因新首相責任重大，必須領導政府度過或爲暹羅前所未見之最困難政治危局。一九三二年暹羅「革命」結果，僅名義上已已主而廢止絕對君主，惟目今預料中之憲法更變，將止次予暹羅以實際之民主。新政府或須應付十三載來統治該國之各政黨反對，且有改組國已大會之重大任務。國已大會代表原有半數係選出，半數由暹王委派，但依照新憲法，國民大會將改爲選舉之國會。至於暹羅人民是否準備負起選舉國會全體議員之充分責任，尚成疑問。</p>

<p>— 張承浚</p>
<p>美國的威爾基先生旅行了北洋的艾爾阿拉敏接線，心中種下一個信念：「戰塲上的精彩勝利不足以使我們打勝這次伸展到世界各個角落的戰爭；唯有新的人物和新的觀念支配我們與東方民族關係的機構，方能獲得全勝，不致使和平僅僅成為另一次的休戰。」（見劉尊棋譯本第十三頁）這是多麼偉大的理智的信念。當我們看到今日世界和平後舉世紛擾的局面，益發覺得威爾先基生的真知灼見及目光的遠大。今日東方民族運動的洶湧澎湃，決不是西文帝國主義用武力高壓手段所能解決。唯有新的人物和新的觀念才能解決這些紛擾，才能共享用數百萬生靈換得來的勝利之果。為法荷等國運計，為世界之永久和平計，唯有改絃易轍，澈底改變其對世界殖民地的政策；尤其是對東方民族。因為東方民族在這次戰爭中都已驚醒，由於中國革命的成功，抗戰的勝利，給予其他東方民族一個光明的指標。他們將向着這個指標前進，他們將學取中國數十年來民族革命的經騐與夫八年來反侵略反帝國主義英勇的事跡。而且中國大部分的人民，同情於他們這種運動。百年來中國在帝國主義——尤其是日本帝國主義政治經濟　事的侵略之下，至今偶一撫摸，猶有餘痛。故民族自決解放運動這一信念，已深植於整個東方民族每一個人的腦中。而今良機來臨，怎能放棄？</p>
<p>真理是不會消滅的，新的時代需要有新的人物和新的觀念來處理。願我們大家深深體味威爾基先生的警語，願我們大家學取新的一切。</p>

<h3 id="c60">恭喜發明 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 戎惠蘭</p>
<p>在這歷雖曰廢而年依存的廢歷年元旦日，親戚朋友自不必說，就是平素見面相識，而不知閣下尊姓的人，一見面，也必須彼此拱拱手，互道一聲：「恭喜發財，大家發財。」聽吧，都是「恭喜發財，大家發財。」到處一片發財聲。年年發財，歲歲發財，可謂發財萬歲。你也發財，我也發財，真是發財第一。</p>
<p>可惜「恭喜發財，大家發財，」這八個字，不是濟顛僧的六字真言，說了等於白說，發財仍成問題。</p>
<p>我不知道：世界各國賀年的祝詞，是否也是「恭喜發財，大家發財！」不過據說，歐美人士賀年，都是用「祝你今年快樂平安」，「進步成功」，「有所創造」。這類的祝詞。似乎沒有人說：「恭喜發財」「大家發財」。</p>
<p>奇怪我們高聲喊發財，時刻想發財，而卻如先總理所說的：「中國無非大貧小貧耳」，而人家並不喊「恭喜發財」，「大家發財」，怎麼卻是大富特富呢？這理由也很簡單。就是我們祗是在說和想，並未做，而人家是也說，又想，更做。</p>
<p>請看和平之後，僅五個月的時間，美國不是又新發明了許多物事嗎？可是我們呢，則依舊是我們。</p>
<p>假設這恭喜發財，大家發財，給友邦人士旦聽見，說不定說我們是窮瘋了呢。</p>
<p>大家這樣致力發財，莫若改變作風，努力發明。在創造上和友邦人士見個高低，不讓友邦人士專美於前。大家見面彼此拱拱手互道一聲「恭喜發明」！（卻酬）</p>

<h3 id="c61">年關停灶 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 陳鏡谷</p>
<p>上海是人浮於事，人浮於市。</p>
<p>馬路上熙攘來往的是人，弄堂中竄進竄出的也是人。槪括言之，上海遍地是人，都是四方八面來的；有的人有錢，在內地不夠刺激與享受，到上海來找刺激講享受；有的人聽說上海遍地是黃金，他們是到上海來淘金子的。</p>
<p>這樣，馬路上擠的人愈多。</p>
<p>統計起來，這麼多的人之中還是借宿戚友處，搭一個臨時的鋪子，三餐上弄堂口吃弄堂飯的人居多。不能冤枉他們一定是來淘金；求一個小差使過日腳的更不知凡幾！大商店裏無線電傳出悠揚的歌曲；霓虹燈放射炫目的廣告。畢竟上海終是上海，無衣無食的人還得牽戀掙扎地住下去，等待一線希望。</p>
<p>過了耶誕節，過了新年，他們都是在默默中過去，當然不能跟一般闊老闊少們比，說是買白蘭地火雞來過節，但總是默默地在弄堂口過去了。可是接着來的是個農歷新年，許多弄堂小飯館門口卻貼起：「年關停灶，暫停營業。」的紅紙條。</p>
<p>有錢的人不會注意這一張條子；有地位有勢的人，有房子有廚子的人不會注意到這種條子。然而吃弄堂飯的人看了，在十二月寒冷的天氣裏，如澆上一盆冰冷的水：</p>
<p>「農歷年關一到，弄堂飯館卻停灶了，怎麼辦呢？」</p>
<p>真是，社會當局注意到勞資糾紛的解決，卻沒有顧到有這麼一個不大不小的社會問題。</p>

<h3 id="c62">梁湖年糕寧波 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>「年年高，節節高，一年四季賺元寶。」農歷年終歲首，家家戶戶，總得備些年糕，煎也好，炒也好，來一盌湯糕更好。在上海，有應時而開的年糕店，可是只可現買現吃，不能久藏。在敝邑寧波鄉間，年糕成為整年食品，務農人家做點心吃，農忙時是唯一的充飢物。因此必須久藏不變，梁湖年糕具有上述條件，因此很出名。</p>
<p>梁湖是舊紹興屬上　縣的一鎮，該地產有一種梁湖米，性比晚米還軟，比糯米硬些。先把那米浸上二十天，然後瀝乾，或乾磨，或水磨，務求細膩，用柴火燒蒸，求其熟透，放在石臼中，用人工舂過，取出。用雙手盡力　揑，直至使有黏性。此種年糕，美味可口，久藏不壞。上海年糕，普通用的杜米，工料兩感不足，若浸入水中三五天便要腐爛，不能與梁湖年糕比，紹興寧波，也用梁湖米種，所以做的年糕，也叫梁湖年糕。</p>
<p>還有一種米槐，祗有寧波有。先用純粹糯米（內不攙粳粒）擦白「糙米一斗要打八折」浸入水中半天，取出瀝乾，由蒸籠蒸熟，成了糯米飯，放在石臼中，由年青壯丁，用力去舂，一人提石搗子舂，一人翻臼內熟米糰，一起一落，春至筋疲力竭，調班再舂。這樣要舂上數十分鐘，變成糯米糰。由臼中取出，摘成槐糰，由男女同工，放在手心，拍成餅形。若防黏性，可在手心放些麵粉。拍得大小均勻。光滑，一個個安置板上，等待涼透，浸入水中。要吃取出，甜食和細沙白糖清燉，鹹食和年糕燒湯，滋味美妙。在上海也有寧波槐出售，可是糯米不純，舂工不到工夫，不及寧波當地的來得好吃。</p>

<h3 id="c63">發揮充沛的精力 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 吳子嘉</p>
<p>每個人都賦有無限的生命的活力，可以把牠用在工作上，事業上。大槪一個成功的人，他一定是能充分的運用他的精力，這種精力，成了工作不可缺少的因素。我們的精力，決沒有白白花了的，牠的報酬就是工作和事業的成功，而我們成功的大小，又全視我們所用的精力的多寡而定。</p>
<p>有許多人固然限於體力，不能儘量發揮他的智能。的確，體力是工作和事業成功的要素。健全的精神寓於健全的身體，體格不健全的人，精神一定萎靡不振，縱想努力工作發展事業，有時亦深感心有而力不足。</p>
<p>但是，社會上有許多人，他們並不全是因為體力不夠而不能儘量發展其智能的。體質虛弱，而不能把自己的精力全部用出來還有相當理由，可是事實上有不少人體力很強健而不肯盡力把自己的工作做得很好，做到成功的頂點。這原因是由於這般人自暴自棄，頺廢消沈，或自卑成性。</p>
<p>美國教育家桑代克氏曾研究足球隊員二百七十人，根據他在一九四〇年發表的測騐結果：在運動塲角逐的球員，縱已用盡其精力，然而其中至少還有百分之三十以上是沒有全部把精力發揮無遺。科倫司，一個美國著名的電氣工程師，他有一次對他的學生說：「我們有無盡的精力蘊藏在體內，我們沒有能把牠充分發揮出來，至多也不過用出一部分，這是很可惜的。」由此可知我們大家都有很充分的精力，但用在工作和事業上卻很少，所以我們要更加努力奮發向前程邁進。</p>
<p>希臘哲人蘇格拉底說：「你要認識自己」。是的，我們要有自知之明，切切不要吝惜自己的精力，在不影響到健康的限度以內，我們萬不可自暴自棄，以為自己的成就不過這一點，多也多不出的。社會上的成功者所以如此之少，成功者所以不能得到更大成功，原因都不外此，我們何以知道已經用出全部的精力呢？我們何以知道我們不能對工作和事業得着更大成的功呢？</p>
<p>假如每個人都能把他的精力充分利用的話，那這個世界將要變得更完美。至於如何發揮我們充沛的精力呢？第一，我們要激發向上的意志，增進對於工作的熱忱，拿「事業心」做前提，不怕艱難，做任何事，不達到成功的目的決不甘休，不做到盡善盡美的地步決不放棄。第二，要有適當的運動，調節疲勞的身心，增進健康的體格，身心康樂，然後做事有興趣，有勇氣。第三，要有樂觀的態度，覺得人生是可愛的，生活是有意義的，這樣自然肯把自己的整個心力獻給人帬，為別人而工作，為社會面服務。能多做點事，多出點力，感到很愉快，很滿足。第四，要適當的利用時間，培養正當的娛樂，革除有害身心的嗜好，不肯浪費時間，就是不肯浪費精力。</p>
<p>從今日起，大家振作起來，好好的發揮自己充沛的精力為，自己，更為社會！</p>

<p>— 虞頌堯</p>
<p>總有一天，月球上的一切山脈，可以用「雷達」來畫出洋圖來。這是英國著名物理學家阿普來登爵士所說的。爵士曾經證明地球的外表是被一層層的帶電空氣圈圍繞着的。他的理論是：由短波發送機所發出的無線電波，遇到月球的表面，就被反射回來。這種回波可以用來畫出月球的地形。</p>
<p>美國放射學研究所人員對於這一點，尚抱懷疑。他們說：理論是不錯的，可是要完成這項工作所需的超力電機，構造匪易。在這種機械尚未完美製成以前，關於月球的材料，看來還是要靠望遠鏡攝影來採集的。（編者按：日前報載已有雷達射到月球。這也許就是測繪月球圖的起點了。）</p>

<h3 id="e6">Military Mediation Department Commemorates Fu Yi; Ye Jianying Postpones Departure from Peiping; Xuzhou Team Departs for Zaozhuang for Inspection <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Special Dispatch] After the cessation of conflict, postal services in the Communist-controlled areas of the Jiaoji, Jinpu, Pinghan, and Longhai lines are planned to be restored as soon as possible. Communist generals in various regions have submitted requests to the Military Mediation Department for postal purchases, supplementary clothing, and the addition of medicines to resist the various demands of the legal currency easy to obtain. The representatives of the National Army of the Military Mediation Department's executive teams have no authority to deal with the exchange of legal tender for a while, but they can express their agreement to other matters. As long as the Communist army fulfills its promise to restore traffic quickly in various places, everything can be discussed at length.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Ye Jianying was originally scheduled to go to Yanan for instructions today, but the trip was postponed due to the lack of aircraft. Today morning, the Executive Department suspended the routine Chief of Staff meeting to commemorate Fu Yi, and no communiqué was issued. Some major decisions may be made after the Spring Festival. As of now, no principles seem to have been established for the resumption of traffic negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] According to the report from the Suiyuan Team, there have been no conflicts in Suiyuan Province except for the Communist army's disturbance in Taolin on the 20th. The Communist army has stopped destroying the Pingsui Railway. Only Jining and Zhuozishan are impassable on the entire line. The Guisui east line is open to Qixiaying. Many water towers between Baotou and Guisui have been destroyed, making driving quite difficult. The Jining Team investigated that 20,000 tons of copper wire were cut off from the road's power line, and thousands of electric poles and a large number of sleepers were damaged.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] According to the report from the Suiyuan Team, the people of Guisui are eager for peace, and the price is also unstable. Each catty of white flour costs about 150 yuan. The people cannot eat their fill or keep warm, and they are suffering greatly. Jining is still stationed by the Communist army, and the city is still peaceful, but it is very desolate. The Northwestern Agricultural and Industrial Bank notes of the CCP, the legal tender, and the pseudo-Mongolian border bills are used in the market. The exact exchange rate has not been determined, and prices are lower than in Peiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 31st] The Xuzhou Team of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has been visiting various conflict locations for inspection in recent days. The government representative Xie Muzhuang, the Communist army representative Wu Juying, and the US representative Harryke flew to Yixian by special plane at 9:30 on the morning of the 31st, and then took a bus to Zaozhuang to inspect the situation there.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Amid the calls to resume traffic, the "Xinhua News Agency," the CCP's news agency that started publishing here last week, reported on the efforts of the CCP's "Liberated Areas" in transportation construction. This is indeed a very informative news item. It is said that: "Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Area Transportation Bureau has dispatched personnel to work with the Pingsui Railway Line Administration to resume railway traffic. In addition to changes in train times and increased frequency, there is now direct traffic between Yanggao and Huailai. Road construction and bridge building are now being designed and implemented for the long term." It also stated: "The Pingsui Railway Bureau is also preparing to set a full-line restoration plan from Peiping to Baotou, collecting materials, and preparing to start construction immediately. Except for the longer time required for bridge repair, other line projects can be completed and opened to traffic in a short period of time." According to its third manuscript, Zhangjiakou has now become the center of the CCP-controlled area for the highway. It can extend to Xingxian, the heart of the Jin-Sui Border Area, with a total length of 2,500 li. The six major highway lines are as follows: (1) From Zhangjiakou via Zhangbei to Shangyi. (2) From Zhangjiakou via Suiyuan Xinghe to Fengzhen. (3) From Zhangjiakou via Tianzhen, Yanggao to Fengzhen, and from Tianzhen via Zuoyun, Wuzhai to Xingxian. (4) From Zhangjiakou via Xuanlongguan Luewubao to Anjiangtun in Rehe, and then via Luanping to Chengde. (5) From Zhangjiakou via Huailai, Yanqing to Tanghekou in Rehe, and then to Chengde. (6) From Zhangjiakou via Xuanhua Xiheying to Laiyuan Xixielingqiu, and south to Zoumayi.

<h3 id="e8">Peiping's Arrest of Japanese War Criminals; Work Progresses Very Slowly <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] The work of arresting Japanese war criminals in Peiping is progressing very slowly. As of today, only more than 50 people have been arrested and detained in the 11th War Zone War Criminal Detention Center. The authorities in charge of the war zone stated that the original number of war criminals to be arrested by order of the Military Commission was more than 170, but they cannot be arrested due to transportation problems. It is reported that recently, various legal groups, agencies, and the public have reported war criminals, and several have begun to be interrogated. However, many only know the war criminal's surname but not their name, so the crimes are difficult to clarify for a while. The military tribunal for interrogating war criminals is composed of three judicial officers from the military law office. After the judicial officers are all present, the trial can be formally opened.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Political Consultative Conference Successfully Concludes <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference, convened on the 10th of last month, lasting 22 days, successfully concluded at 8:30 PM on the 31st. During these 22 days, the people of the entire nation paid close attention to the proceedings of the Political Consultative Conference. Under the unified slogan of "Only success is permitted, failure is not," the successful establishment of important agreements and the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference is truly the only exciting and gratifying event since the surrender of the Japanese and the victory in the War of Resistance. Throughout the more than 20 days of the conference, all parties were able to be mutually accommodating, allowing the conference to proceed smoothly in a harmonious and coordinated atmosphere. This demonstrates how all parties were able to set aside personal opinions for the sake of the overall situation. This spirit of coordination is truly worth celebrating. After a long period of war, the Chinese people are in dire need of an opportunity to rest and recuperate in order to achieve national rejuvenation. The surrender of the Japanese and the victory in the War of Resistance was good news, making it clear to them that the Chinese nation's mortal struggle with Japan for national freedom had victoriously ended. This excited them. But before long, this excitement dissipated due to the shadows of actual political issues within the country. Therefore, they placed ardent hopes on the Political Consultative Conference convened to eliminate these political shadows, hoping that the consultation would yield results and that the Chinese people would have an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. The reason the Political Consultative Conference was able to achieve a successful outcome is that we must attribute it to the participants of the PCC who prioritized the nation and the people, setting aside personal opinions. Today, as we prepare to implement constitutional government, this democratic style of mutual accommodation is particularly worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>The agreements reached by the Political Consultative Conference consist of five aspects: first, regarding government organization; second, regarding the program of governance; third, regarding military issues; fourth, regarding the National Assembly; and fifth, regarding the constitutional draft. Looking at the established agreements, all of them respect the national system while taking into account objective facts. For example, the agreement on government organization strengthens the power of the National Government Committee, adjusts the organization of the National Government Committee members, increases the number of members to 40, with half being Kuomintang members and half being non-Kuomintang members, and establishes political affairs committee members under the Executive Yuan. All of these are appropriate adjustments to the current political system. This adjustment, on the one hand, can satisfy the desire of various parties and factions to participate in the government in a practical way, and on the other hand, it is sufficient to fulfill the Kuomintang's long-held desire to treat the nation as a public trust. At the same time, it is also sufficient to live up to the great kindness of our allied nations in supporting a strong, unified, and democratic China.</p>
<p>In addition, the convening of the National Assembly was originally a focal point of contention during the conference. The agreement now reached allows the National Assembly to be convened as scheduled, thereby maintaining the government's credibility. At the same time, in order to adapt to the current situation, the number of representatives has been expanded to allow various parties, factions, and social elites to participate as much as possible, which is also a wise decision. The remaining governance programs, military issues, and constitutional drafts have all been decided based on the spirit of coordination and mutual accommodation. The efforts of the participants in this Political Consultative Conference should have eliminated the current political problems. We believe that these agreements are not merely written documents, nor are they effective only in certain areas. They will certainly be faithfully and universally implemented in the spirit of the agreements. Observing that this consultative conference was able to proceed smoothly and conclude successfully, we firmly believe that these agreements will be faithfully implemented and promoted throughout the country, and will never become an unfulfilled promise.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the importance of the various agreements reached by the PCC, none surpasses the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance. The other agreements concerning government organization, military issues, and the constitutional draft can all be said to be based on the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance as the fundamental center. This is a turning point that builds on the past and looks to the future. Since this program was jointly formulated by the various parties and factions and social elites participating in the PCC, it should be the preparation for peaceful nation-building in the future, similar to the "Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction" during the War of Resistance. In Chairman Chiang's closing address to the PCC, we saw the Chairman say: "I believe that among all the proposals, the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction should be regarded as the fundamental center of all the proposals, because the various provisions of this case, from the general principles to the people's rights, to politics, to military affairs, to foreign affairs, to economy and finance, to education and culture, to post-war relief, to overseas Chinese affairs, etc., in nine chapters, are extremely complete, truly in line with the needs of the times, full of unity, full of democracy, and truly the most appropriate program for transitioning to the constitutional era. With this program, from the central government to all local governments throughout the country, from all parties and factions and social leaders to compatriots throughout the country, we have a common standard to follow. In particular, the various parties and factions participating in this conference have discussed and agreed upon this program together, and will participate in the government to implement it together." It can be seen how important the formulation of the Program for National Reconstruction and Governance is in the current political situation.</p>
<p>As Chairman Chiang said in his closing address to the PCC, since this program was jointly formulated by the various parties and factions participating in the association and social elites, this program must also apply equally to the areas where the CCP's troops are stationed. In the CCP's stationed areas, it should also "ensure that the people enjoy freedom of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, migration, and communication." At the same time, since political parties can now operate openly, there should be no more acts of armed rebellion or secret organization in various places. Regarding the nationalization of the CCP's troops, since there is a provision in this Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, it must be earnestly implemented. All national troops, regardless of party affiliation or region, should obey the command of the government to achieve the standards of unified military orders, military administration, and military and political command.</p>
<p>The successful conclusion of the PCC coincided with the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve. "The sound of firecrackers removes the old," and everything in the past is wished to vanish with the sound of firecrackers. Thereafter, spring returns to the earth, which is also a good opportunity for us to remove the old and bring forth the new in politics, a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Party politics will once again emerge in China. May all the past bad phenomena of all political parties since the Republic of China disappear with the old year. We sincerely hope that China can become stronger, more unified, and more democratic under the recognized Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle of nation-building.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] More than 1,000 personnel from the Aeronautical Affairs Commission who are returning to the capital have arrived. It is reported that a batch of technical personnel will arrive continuously after the Spring Festival. Huang Guangrui, Deputy Director of the Aeronautical Affairs Commission, in order to strengthen the self-esteem of the air force soldiers, yesterday strictly prohibited his subordinates from wearing air force uniforms to enter the Confucius Temple entertainment venues. This is because in various places such as Nanjing and Shanghai, there are often frivolous young men wearing military uniforms who patronize prostitutes and swagger through the streets, causing misunderstandings.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] A broadcast from London on the 1st stated that the Security Council met this afternoon to discuss the Soviet Union's complaint against the presence of British troops in Greece. During the meeting, the council allowed a representative from Greece to be seated. Subsequently, Soviet representative Vyshinsky delivered a speech, stating that the Soviet Union's complaint was not unexpected. Prior to this, the Soviet Union had raised the Greek issue with the Allied countries three times. The last time was during the Moscow Conference of the three foreign ministers, when the Soviet side also raised the issue for discussion, but without result. As of the time of this report, the Security Council was still in session.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The Security Council, which had just discussed Iran's complaint on Wednesday, met today to discuss the Greek issue, reviewing the Soviet Union's complaint that the presence of British troops in Greece endangered peace and security. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie was recommended by the Security Council as the Secretary-General of the United Nations and may be approved at today's plenary session. The Economic and Security Councils and the Trusteeship Committee will all meet today, so today will be a busy day. In addition, the Military Staff Committee, which controls the United Nations forces, is also scheduled to meet today, but it has not been officially announced whether the Soviet representative will be able to arrive in time, otherwise a postponement will be inevitable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Indonesian issue is expected to be left for discussion at the next meeting. Lundis came to England from Athens, presumably carrying new instructions from the government, fearing that he would not be able to consult with Foreign Secretary Bevin before the meeting. Responsible observers expect that Lundis will not support the claims of his predecessor, Soyanopoulos, who believed that the dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Greek issue should be resolved through direct negotiations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 1st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will respond to the Soviet Union's complaint. The content will depend on the Soviet Union's remarks, but Bevin "does not want a duel," he said.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Trusteeship Council Election to Be Held in the United States <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The election of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, as well as the establishment of international institutions to protect former League of Nations mandated territories and other dependent lands, will have to wait until the second half of the United Nations General Assembly's first meeting in the United States. The Trusteeship Committee's subcommittee was still unable to establish a clear definition of the phrase "countries directly related to the mandated territories" yesterday, and the Trusteeship Committee has been delayed for more than a week because of this matter, and it seems that there is still no solution. Canada proposed that when a member state intends to transfer land to trusteeship, it must notify the Secretary-General of its intention and the names of the countries it intends to negotiate with. The latter should inform all member states, and any country that considers itself directly related but is not included in the list may inform the Secretary-General so that it can be forwarded to the original presenting country. This suggestion was deemed too broad and was not accepted by the major trustee powers. Syria still argued that the opinions of countries that are linguistically, socially, culturally, and economically similar to the people of the mandated territories should be sought. The committee, with divergent opinions, decided to leave the entire trusteeship issue for discussion in the second half of the General Assembly.</p>

This assassination occurred on March 19, 1943. On that day, Hitler was preparing to depart from the Soviet front line to return home. Before Hitler's plane took off, Schlabrendorff placed a time bomb under Hitler's seat in the plane, but the bomb's fuse failed and it did not explode.

<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 31st] The U.S. House of Representatives will consider a bill to prohibit the disclosure of information obtained from the upcoming atomic bomb bombing fleet test to foreign countries, so that the future security of the United States will not be threatened.

The bill was submitted to the committee by Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the Navy's Special Mixed Fleet responsible for directing the test. The original text of the bill is as follows: The Secretaries of the Army and Navy shall take necessary steps to ensure that information relating to the test is not disclosed to foreign governments or people, except where they deem that it would not harm the interests of the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Prime Minister Attlee stated last night in the House of Commons that the British government hopes that the use of atomic energy will be developed in cooperation rather than competition with other countries.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from London on the 1st, British envoy to Indonesia Lord Killearn arrived in Batavia today. It is reported that the points he stated at the previous press conference were quite different from what was reported in the newspapers. He did not advocate that Indonesia should be placed under a trusteeship system, but only suggested that the country join the United Nations organization. There were continued conflicts in Java today, with many casualties. [Associated Press, London, 31st] Lord Killearn, former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union and now Ambassador to the United States, recently traveled to Java as a special envoy to mediate the East Indies issue. It was learned today that he had made an explosive declaration, stating that it is highly possible that the East Indies will be transferred to the United Nations organization for trusteeship. Dutch circles were mostly incredulous upon hearing the news. A Dutch official told a reporter from the Associated Press that Dutch people in London had not been able to confirm that Killearn had made this statement. Spokespersons for the British Colonial Office and the Foreign Office said that they did not believe that the Netherlands would be willing to abandon the East Indies to the United Nations for trusteeship. U.S. officials also expressed surprise at the news and shared the same observation as the British, seeming to believe that the Netherlands would not be willing to take this action. According to the United Nations Charter, countries can voluntarily transfer their territories to the United Nations organization for trusteeship. If the Netherlands is willing to abandon the East Indies, it will put other colonial countries in a very difficult situation.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Leader of the Siamese Progressive Party, Khuang Aphaiwong, Appointed New Prime Minister; Charged with the Important Task of Establishing Progress <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 1st] King Mahidol of Siam yesterday morning appointed Khuang Aphaiwong, the well-respected leader of the Democratic Party, as the new Prime Minister of Siam. Khuang's name was recommended to the King by the Speaker of the House after debate in the National Assembly on Wednesday. The new Prime Minister stated yesterday that he hopes Siam will soon become a member of the United Nations. Regarding the land annexed by Siam from Vietnam in 1941, which caused disputes with France, Siam welcomes assistance from Britain and the United States in resolving the matter. He predicted that a plebiscite held in the disputed area would vote in favor of annexation by Siam. Regarding the Anglo-Siamese Treaty, he anticipated "heated debate" in the National Assembly. Khuang is Siamese, but he comes from Cambodia, one of the four French protectorates of Vietnam, a large part of which has been annexed by Siam. After the overthrow of the dictatorship of former Siamese Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram in August 1944, Khuang succeeded him as Prime Minister for a time, until August of last year. Khuang's appointment follows five days of political turmoil, during which candidates favored by various parties were unwilling to accept the position. The new Prime Minister bears a heavy responsibility, as he must lead the government through what may be the most difficult political crisis Siam has ever faced. The 1932 Siamese "Revolution" resulted only in nominal progress and the abolition of absolute monarchy, but the currently anticipated constitutional changes will finally give Siam genuine democracy. The new government may have to deal with opposition from the parties that have ruled the country for the past thirteen years, and it faces the important task of reorganizing the National Assembly. Originally, half of the representatives in the National Assembly were elected and half were appointed by the King of Siam, but under the new constitution, the National Assembly will be replaced by an elected parliament. Whether the Siamese people are prepared to fully assume the responsibility of electing all members of parliament remains questionable.</p>

<p>Hangzhou: China Bank Defrauded of a Large Sum – The Hangzhou China Bank previously lost a blank remittance form. At the time, they did not suspect anything and simply canceled the form's number. Unexpectedly, the bank recently received a notice from the Zhenjiang China Bank stating that a remittance of 9 million dollars had been processed. The Hangzhou bank was deeply surprised, as it had not remitted 9 million dollars to Zhenjiang. Upon investigation, the remittance form was found to be the one that had been stolen. All the seals used on the remittance form were forged, but the recipient in Zhenjiang had previously submitted the recipient's seal to the bank, so the forged remittance form was able to be smoothly cashed for the full amount. Overall, this major case of forgery involving a large sum of money was clearly premeditated. Leads have been obtained, and a thorough investigation is underway.</p>

<p>Donghua started this season strongly, defeating the Soviet Union and Hequn by large margins. Unfortunately, last week's game against the Italian Overseas Chinese ended in a draw due to rain, which was regrettable. Today, the team will face the British Navy, as the HMS "Glenearn" has arrived in Shanghai, and it is said that there are many good football players among the crew. To avoid repeating past mistakes, Donghua has carefully considered its lineup. Xue Ning has decided to play, but Zhang Banglun is unavailable due to personal matters. Liu Xianhan will take his place. In addition, left midfielder Song Lingsheng is still out of town, and if he is unable to make it, Han Longbo will take his place. In any case, Donghua is being extremely cautious in today's match against the British Navy, whose strength is unknown. Today's schedule is listed below:</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The labor strike at the electricity company took a sudden turn the day before yesterday, and yesterday it took another sharp turn downward. Yesterday, from early morning, the labor strike at the electricity company gradually progressed. The main developments:</p>
<p>Beginning of Negotiations</p>
<p>(1) At approximately 11 AM, more than 2,000 workers gathered at the Social Bureau on Madang Road to collectively submit a petition, demanding the release of the 19 arrested members of the labor union's board of directors and supervisors. (2) At 12 PM, Director Li Jianhua and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Bureau began negotiations with the temporary representatives of the workers. The workers demanded: (a) the immediate release of the arrested worker representatives; (b) the immediate investigation of those disturbing order; (c) the immediate request for the management to resolve the conditions with a reasonable attitude. (3) At approximately 4 PM, all the "three-shift" workers (i.e., the workers maintaining electricity generation) at the electricity company left the factory and went to the Social Bureau to join the petitioning group. (4) At approximately 8 PM, negotiations took a turn for the better. Director Li Jianhua of the Social Bureau reported to all the workers that the government, in consideration of the welfare of the citizens and to avoid a "powerless New Year," and to promote harmony between labor and management, was prepared to consider the request to release the arrested workers.</p>
<p>Workers' Guarantee</p>
<p>(5) After Director Li Jianhua's report, the workers elected 10 temporary representatives to negotiate the release conditions as follows: 1. Guarantee immediate resumption of work by all workers, and workers on duty in the machinery room during the holiday period (February 2 to 5) will go to the factory as usual and will not be obstructed; 2. After the Spring Festival holiday, the government will continue to convene mediation; 3. Guarantee that workers will abide by government laws and regulations, and will not engage in any further work stoppages or strikes during the mediation or arbitration period. The signatories on February 1 were: Li Sheng and Qiu Zaiyao from the Nanjing Road representatives, Zhang Mincai and Yan Shaoling from Yangshupu representatives, Tang Lansheng and Wang Enpeng, Zhang Shiting and Yu Jiqing, Qi Denggao and Ding Buyun from Feilun Road representatives. (6) The temporary representatives sought the opinions of all the workers and read out the conditions for approval. All the workers passed it. (7) At 9:30 PM, Director Li Jianhua, Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan, and Section Chief Zhou Shangyi of the Social Bureau went to the Xuehuali Road Local Procuratorate to handle the bail procedures with the temporary representatives. (8) At 11:30 PM, all 19 arrested representatives were released on bail and, together with the temporary representatives, were taken to the Social Bureau by the police in a black bus.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian Speaks</p>
<p>Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau stated in his speech: "The labor strike at the electricity company was illegal because the workers did not follow the procedures of the Labor Dispute Resolution Act and went on strike without authorization. I sympathize with the workers' hardships and have tried my best to mediate. Unfortunately, the workers did not accept the advice and delayed for many days, and the dispute of yesterday occurred, which is regrettable. Today, the workers petitioned for the release of the arrested representatives. According to the law, the executive branch has no right to interfere with the judiciary. However, I sympathize with the workers' pain and, after consulting with the mayor, decided to assist the petitioning workers to bail out from the court in order to resolve the matter. I hope that in the future, the workers must abide by the legal framework so that labor-management disputes can be resolved in accordance with legal procedures, especially public utilities, which are of great importance to the welfare of the entire city. Workers should not arbitrarily engage in work stoppages or strikes. If the workers have reasonable demands, the government will do its best to assist them in resolving them, but they must not exceed the scope of the law, so that the government cannot assist them."</p>

Representatives of the union, including Weng Enlong, and representatives of the theater owners, including Han Guangyao, agreed to sign a settlement in writing: (1) Wages: First-run theaters 185,000 yuan per month, second-run theaters 165,000 yuan per month, third-run theaters 145,000 yuan per month, fourth-run theaters 120,000 yuan per month. The above wages are based on a standard of three workers per theater, with proportional increases for those exceeding this number. (2) Effective January 16, 1946. (3) Any existing theater treatment better than stipulated in Article 1 will remain as is. It is reported that all workers will resume work this morning, and morning shows at all theaters will resume today as usual.</p>

<p>Yesterday was New Year's Eve, and most businesses were closed. Only gold shops remained open due to time constraints, attracting a large number of customers. The market opened at 1,155,000 [yuan per tael], and driven by the enthusiastic buying from gold shops and small money changers, prices quickly surged to a new high of around 2,130,000. A large bank sold aggressively at the high, pushing the price down to 1,170,000 at one point. However, by noon, prices had recovered to 1,210,000, a further increase of 70,000 compared to the previous close. Trading then ceased, with even scattered transactions disappearing. The final quoted price for gold ornaments was 130,000, while silver remained at 1,100 yuan. Silver dollars ranged from 680 to 730 yuan, with inconsistent quoted prices. The unofficial discount rate stabilized yesterday at around 15%. Foreign currencies, with the exception of the US dollar and associated notes, generally lacked formal market rates. The US dollar ranged from 1,620 to 1,720 yuan, closing around 1,700 yuan, with a significant difference between buying and selling prices. Hong Kong notes saw even fewer transactions, with old notes ranging from 240 to 260 yuan and new notes ranging from 70 to 75 yuan, a very quiet market, with prices higher than the previous close.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Government Bonds See Slight Activity - Stock Prices Rise Across the Board <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Except for Class C bonds, which saw some activity, government bonds were generally inactive yesterday. Reports indicate that seven types of government bonds were being redeemed by lottery in the wartime capital, suppressing prices. Generally, prices ranged from 2,000 to 2,100 yuan. Scattered transactions were seen in Chinese stocks, with quoted prices for several popular stocks rising by about half a percentage point, although the trading volume was not widespread and could not be considered a formal market trend. Foreign stocks saw widespread price increases, but trading volume remained low. Based on buying prices, stocks also saw a significant increase.</p>

<p>The Equipment General Depot of the Wartime Production Bureau has been transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs after the dissolution of the Production Bureau. To meet the needs of postwar industrial reconstruction, the General Depot will relocate to Shanghai and establish branch depots in Qingdao, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Hankou. (The Chongqing branch depot is being reorganized, while the Kunming branch depot will be retained.) It is reported that the Hankou branch depot was established this month, with Liu Zelin, the former Chengdu Special Commissioner of the Industry and Mining Adjustment Office, as its director. Kang Taihong, the deputy director of the Shanghai General Depot, has been dispatched to prepare for the relocation. It is also reported that the industrial equipment portion of the UNRRA relief supplies will be handled by the depot.</p>
<p>(Further News) To support the 2.7 billion emergency loan program for small and medium-sized industries in the rear areas and the acquisition of machinery, the depot has established temporary branch depots at the Yuxin Iron and Steel Factory in Xiaolongkan, the China Xingye Company in Xiangguo Temple, and the Huazhong Machinery Factory in Yemao Creek. It is reported that over 800 pieces of machinery have been acquired, most of which are still in good condition. Except for a small portion of lightweight equipment and equipment unsuitable for the rear areas, which will be transferred to the east, the remaining equipment will be retained in Chongqing for the development of industry in the southwest.</p>

<p>— Zhang Chengjun</p>
<p>Mr. Willkie of the United States, after traveling along the Al-Alamien line in North Africa, planted a belief in his heart: "Brilliant victories on the battlefield are not enough to win this war that extends to every corner of the world; only new people and new ideas dominating the institutions of our relations with Eastern nations can achieve complete victory and prevent peace from becoming just another truce." (See page 13 of Liu Zunqi's translation). This is such a great and rational belief. When we see the turbulent situation in the world after today's peace, we feel even more the wisdom of Willkie's foresight. The surging tide of Eastern national movements today cannot be resolved by the Western imperialist use of force and high-pressure tactics. Only new people and new ideas can resolve these disturbances and share the fruits of victory earned by millions of lives. For the sake of the future of countries like France and the Netherlands, for the sake of lasting world peace, the only way is to change course completely and radically change their policies towards colonies around the world; especially towards Eastern nations. Because the Eastern nations have awakened in this war, and the success of the Chinese Revolution and the victory of the War of Resistance have provided a bright indicator for other Eastern nations. They will move towards this indicator, they will learn from China's decades of experience in national revolution and its eight years of heroic deeds against aggression and imperialism. And most of the people in China sympathize with their movement. For a hundred years, China has suffered from the aggression of imperialism - especially Japanese imperialism - in the political, economic, and military fields. Even now, a gentle touch still evokes lingering pain. Therefore, the belief in national self-determination and liberation has been deeply rooted in the minds of every person in the entire Eastern nation. Now that a good opportunity has arrived, how can they give it up?</p>
<p>Truth will not be extinguished, and the new era requires new people and new ideas to handle it. May we all deeply appreciate Mr. Willkie's warning, and may we all learn from all that is new.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Congratulations on Invention <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Huilan</p>
<p>On this Lunar New Year's Day, when the old calendar is nominally abolished but still exists, relatives and friends, not to mention those we meet and know but do not know your esteemed name, must greet each other with clasped hands, mutually saying, "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich." Listen, it's all "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich." A sound of getting rich everywhere. Get rich every year, get rich every year, it can be called getting rich forever. You get rich, I get rich, it's truly getting rich first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these eight words, "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich," are not the six-character mantra of the monk Ji Dian, saying them is like saying nothing, and getting rich remains a problem.</p>
<p>I don't know if the New Year greetings in other countries are also "Congratulations on getting rich, everyone get rich!" However, it is said that Westerners greet the New Year with "Wishing you happiness and peace this year," "Progress and success," "Something created." It seems that no one says "Congratulations on getting rich" or "Everyone get rich."</p>
<p>It's strange that we shout loudly to get rich, think about getting rich all the time, but as the late Premier Sun said, "China is nothing more than the great poor and the small poor," while others don't shout "Congratulations on getting rich" or "Everyone get rich," but how can they be so rich and especially rich? The reason is also very simple. It's because we are only saying and thinking, not doing, while others are also saying, also thinking, and even more doing.</p>
<p>Please see, after the peace, in just five months, hasn't the United States invented many new things? But as for us, we are still the same as before.</p>
<p>If foreigners were to hear us constantly congratulating each other on getting rich, they might say we are crazy from poverty.</p>
<p>Instead of everyone focusing on getting rich like this, it's better to change our style and strive to invent. Let's compete with foreigners in creation, not letting them have a monopoly on being first. Everyone, when you meet, clasp your hands and say to each other "Congratulations on invention!" (End of Reward)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Year-End Stove Shutdown <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jinggu</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where there are more people than there are jobs, more people than there are markets.</p>
<p>The streets are crowded with people coming and going, and people are darting in and out of the alleyways. In general, Shanghai is full of people, all coming from all directions; some people have money, not enough stimulation and enjoyment in the interior, so they come to Shanghai to find stimulation and talk about enjoyment; some people have heard that Shanghai is full of gold, so they come to Shanghai to pan for gold.</p>
<p>In this way, the streets are becoming more and more crowded with people.</p>
<p>Statistics show that among so many people, there are still many who stay with relatives and friends, setting up a temporary bed, and eating alleyway food three times a day at the entrance of the alleyway. It cannot be said that they must be coming to pan for gold; there are even more who are just looking for a small job to make a living! In large stores, wireless radios broadcast melodious songs; neon lights emit dazzling advertisements. After all, Shanghai is still Shanghai, and those without clothes or food still have to struggle to live, waiting for a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Christmas has passed, New Year's has passed, and they have all passed silently, of course, they cannot be compared with the general rich and young masters, who say they buy brandy and turkey to celebrate the holiday, but they always pass silently at the entrance of the alleyway. But next comes the Lunar New Year, and many small restaurants in the alleyways have posted red strips of paper: "Year-end stove shutdown, temporarily closed."</p>
<p>People with money will not pay attention to this strip; people with status and power, people with houses and cooks will not pay attention to this kind of strip. However, people who eat alleyway food look at it, in the cold weather of December, it is like pouring a basin of cold water:</p>
<p>"Once the Lunar New Year comes, the alleyway restaurants shut down their stoves, what to do?"</p>
<p>Indeed, the social authorities pay attention to the resolution of labor-capital disputes, but they have not taken into account such a social problem that is neither too big nor too small.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Lianghu Rice Cake Ningbo <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Duyun</p>
<p>"Year after year higher, section after section higher, earn ingots all year round." At the end of the Lunar New Year, every household must prepare some rice cakes. Whether fried or stir-fried, it is even better to have a bowl of rice cake soup. In Shanghai, there are rice cake shops that open in season, but they can only be bought and eaten immediately, they cannot be stored for a long time. In my hometown of Ningbo, rice cakes are a year-round food. Farmers use them as snacks, and during the busy farming season, they are the only filling food. Therefore, they must be stored for a long time without spoiling, and Lianghu rice cakes have the above conditions, so they are very famous.</p>
<p>Lianghu is a town in Shangyu County, formerly under the jurisdiction of Shaoxing. The area produces a type of Lianghu rice, which is softer than late rice and harder than glutinous rice. First, soak the rice for twenty days, then drain it, or dry grind it, or water grind it, striving for fineness. Steam it with firewood, ensuring it is thoroughly cooked. Place it in a stone mortar and pound it by hand, then take it out. Knead it vigorously with both hands until it is sticky. This kind of rice cake is delicious and can be stored for a long time without spoiling. The ordinary rice used in Shanghai rice cakes is Du rice, and both the workmanship and materials are insufficient. If immersed in water for three to five days, it will rot. It cannot be compared with Lianghu rice cakes. Shaoxing and Ningbo also use Lianghu rice varieties, so the rice cakes made are also called Lianghu rice cakes.</p>
<p>There is also a type of rice cake called Mihuai, which is only available in Ningbo. First, use pure glutinous rice (without any non-glutinous grains) and rub it white. "One dou of coarse rice should be discounted by 20%." Immerse it in water for half a day, take it out and drain it, then steam it in a steamer until cooked, turning it into glutinous rice. Place it in a stone mortar and pound it hard by young, strong men. One person lifts the stone pestle to pound, and one person turns the cooked rice ball inside the mortar, together with each fall, pounding until exhausted, then switch shifts to pound again. This takes several tens of minutes, turning it into a glutinous rice ball. Take it out of the mortar, pick it into Huai balls, and let men and women work together, placing it in the palm of the hand and patting it into a pancake shape. To prevent stickiness, you can put some flour in the palm of your hand. Pat them evenly in size and smooth, then place them one by one on a board and wait for them to cool completely before immersing them in water. To eat, take them out, sweeten them with fine sand sugar and stew them, or savory, use them to make soup with rice cakes, the taste is wonderful. There are also Ningbo Huai sold in Shanghai, but the glutinous rice is not pure, and the pounding is not enough, it is not as delicious as the local Ningbo ones.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Unleash Abundant Energy <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zijia</p>
<p>Everyone is endowed with unlimited vital life force, which can be used for work and career. Generally speaking, a successful person must be able to fully utilize his energy. This energy has become an indispensable factor for work. Our energy is never spent in vain, its reward is the success of work and career, and the size of our success depends entirely on how much energy we use.</p>
<p>Many people are indeed limited by physical strength and cannot maximize their intelligence. Indeed, physical strength is a key element to work and career success. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body, and people with unhealthy bodies will inevitably feel mentally sluggish. Even if they want to work hard to develop their careers, they sometimes feel that their heart is willing but their strength is not enough.</p>
<p>However, there are many people in society who do not fail to maximize their intelligence entirely because of insufficient physical strength. There is a considerable reason for being physically weak and unable to use all of one's energy, but the fact is that there are many people who are physically strong but are unwilling to do their best to make their work excellent and reach the pinnacle of success. This is because these people abandon themselves to despair, decline and sink, or are inherently self-deprecating.</p>
<p>American educator Edward Thorndike studied 270 football players. According to the test results he published in 1940, the players competing on the sports field, even though they had exhausted their energy, still had at least 30% that had not fully unleashed their energy. Colin, a famous American electrical engineer, once said to his students, "We have endless energy stored in our bodies, and we have not been able to fully unleash it. At most, we only use a portion of it, which is very regrettable." From this, we can see that we all have very sufficient energy, but we use very little of it in work and career, so we must work harder and move forward toward the future.</p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Socrates said, "Know thyself." Yes, we must have self-awareness, and we must not be stingy with our energy. Within the limits of not affecting health, we must never abandon ourselves to despair, thinking that our achievements are only this point, and nothing more can be done. The reason why there are so few successful people in society, and why successful people cannot achieve greater success, is none other than this. How do we know that we have used all of our energy? How do we know that we cannot achieve greater success in work and career?</p>
<p>If everyone could make full use of his energy, then this world would become more perfect. As for how to unleash our abundant energy? First, we must stimulate the will to move forward, increase enthusiasm for work, take "sense of career" as a prerequisite, not be afraid of difficulties, and never give up until the purpose of success is achieved in doing anything, and never give up until we do it perfectly. Second, we must have appropriate exercise, regulate the tired body and mind, increase healthy physique, and then we will be interested and courageous in doing things. Third, we must have an optimistic attitude, feel that life is lovely and that life is meaningful, so naturally we are willing to dedicate our entire mind and strength to the crowd, to work for others, and to serve society. Being able to do more things and contribute more effort is very pleasant and satisfying. Fourth, we must make appropriate use of time, cultivate legitimate entertainment, eliminate habits that are harmful to the body and mind, and not be willing to waste time, which is not willing to waste energy.</p>
<p>From today onwards, let us all cheer up and make good use of our abundant energy for ourselves, and even more for society!</p>

<h3 id="e64">Using Radar to Map the Moon <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Songyao</p>
<p>Someday, all the mountains on the moon can be mapped with "radar." This is what the famous British physicist Sir Edward Appleton said. Sir Appleton has proven that the Earth's surface is surrounded by layers of charged air. His theory is that radio waves emitted by shortwave transmitters are reflected back when they encounter the surface of the moon. This echo can be used to map the moon's terrain.</p>
<p>Personnel at the US Institute of Radiology are still skeptical about this. They say: The theory is correct, but the super-powered motors required to complete this task are difficult to construct. Until this machinery is perfectly made, it seems that materials about the moon will still have to be collected by telescope photography. (Editor's Note: It was reported a few days ago that radar has been transmitted to the moon. This may be the starting point for mapping the moon.)</p>

<p>— Weibo</p>
<p>The people of Chongqing finally organized a "Preparatory Association for the Political Consultative Conference of All Circles in the Wartime Capital." Every evening, the representatives of the PCC were invited to report in turn, and people from all walks of life freely expressed their opinions, the situation was very enthusiastic. The first general meeting was held at 7 pm on the 12th of this month in the Yu Cooperation Auditorium. At the beginning and end of the meeting, the whole audience sang "Democracy and Unity Song"; this song is the posthumous work of Mr. Xian Xinghai, originally named "National Salvation Army Song", after Tao Xingzhi, Li Gongpu, Mao Dun and others modified the lyrics, in order to help the democratic movement, the full text of the lyrics is as follows:</p>
<p>Democracy and unity, step forward in unison, respect the common people, never beat the people. We are the people's army, we are the heart of benevolence, establish a democratic government, and be free people forever!</p>
<p>May this song, rise in every place in China in the New Year, become mutual encouragement and blessing for every compatriot!</p>
