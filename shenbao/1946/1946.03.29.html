<p>〔合衆社北平廿八日電〕値此調處執行部執行小組四隊將於廿九日前往東北之際，國共軍隊之衝突，至少在三個地段已愈趨激烈，長春之情勢亦益趨緊張，謠傳共產軍緊隨蘇軍之撤退，正大批混入城中。據最近之氣象報吿，執行小組四隊可於廿九日淸晨出發，每隊中包括美國陸軍上校一名。截止今日傍晚，執行小組將往何處依然秘而不宣，大致將於抵達目的地後，再由調處執行部發表一特別公報。據今日東北方面來訊稱：國共衝突中心，係在撫順煤礦東北，遼陽一帶以及四平街周圍。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕美副國務卿艾克遜本日吿記者稱：聞馬歇爾元帥渴盼於其在此間公務完畢後，即遄返中國，然行期猶未定。艾氏並未詳述馬帥之公務，唯官方承認馬帥曾親自敎促全國對外貸款委會，向中國作倍用貸款，馬帥自於兩週前抵華盛頓後，即申述立予中國經濟及物質協助之需要。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿八日電〕馬歇爾將軍之代表吉倫中將曾與蔣主席就軍事問題進行會商數次。一般預料，張治中將軍因其他工作關係，以致軍事小組方面之工作，或將另行任命他人繼任。可靠方面人士稱：吉倫與周恩來均努力挽留張治中，以便按照預定計劃，共同訪問東北，但政府方面大致以爲，東北問題即使更屬重要，張氏應從事處理渠所暢曉之新疆自治問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿八日電〕張治中定廿九日啓程赴迪化，俾與伊寗代表談判最後協定。陪都人士預料，張氏此行，必可簽訂協定，予新疆人民以高度自治，並取消所謂「東土耳其斯坦共和國」。</p>

<p>〔又電〕據悉我軍事代表國將來之行動，將以蘇軍總部之行動爲轉移。一般觀察，此間蘇軍總部可能在不久之將來移駐哈爾濱，屆時我軍事代表團，亦將隨往。又在四平街被俘之遼北省政府主席劉瀚東，秘書長徐　，委員張式綸等一行十四人，返抵長春後，曾發表書面談話詳述經過。</p>

<p>全國靑年們，抗戰是結束了，我們的國家已經步入了一個新的時代，我們的革命，也走到了一個新的階段，國家對於靑年，提出强烈的要求，而革命對於靑年，也賦予一個重大的使命，這個要求，就是維護國家獨立平等的地位。這個使命，就是建設一個統一民主富强康樂的現代國家，如果我們以爲不平等條約已經取銷，國家獨立平等的地位就可以獲得，日本侵略强權已經崩潰，國家富强康樂的境遇，就可以坐致，因而疏忽懈怠，甚至於散漫紛亂，那就是一個絕大的錯誤。這個錯誤，不只是要貽誤我靑年的一生事業，而且要使我們國家民族，陷於永刧不復的絕境。要知道革命抗戰的成果，是難得而易失的，國父說：「革命破壞之後，必繼之以革命的建設」，又說：「建屋不能猝就，建國亦然」，我們的國家經過了長期抗戰的破壞，必繼之以革命非常的建設，才能够保持獨立平等的地位，自立於國際社會之林。我們冒險犯難流血犧牲所得的勝利成果，決不可稍有懈怠，使其喪失，我們朝夕追尋的建國大業，決不可稍有疏忽，任其挫折，而散漫紛亂，更是自取滅亡的死路。我們全國靑年，必須發揚革命抗戰的精神，認識國家民族的需要，刻苦耐勞，忍辱負重，集中力量，齊一步驟，養成我們革命偉大的人格，發揚我們民族固有的精神，確保我們國家獨立平等的地位，負起建設統一强大的三民主義新中國的使命。</p>
<p>我們的建設事業，需要和平的環境，而和平的基礎，在於國家的統一，國家不統一，就無法安定，國家不統一，更無法獨立。第二次世界大戰，使世界人類都感覺和平之可貴，而中國長期的抗戰，更使我全國人民都認識國家的統一之可貴，因爲統一是建國的前提，所以我們必須盡最大最善的努力，來促其迅速的實現。我們中國作戰的時間最久，所受的戰禍最深，當此戰事終止之時，迫切需要休養生息，以眧蘇民困，恢復國力，所以自日本投降以來，六個月間，團結統一，和平建設，成爲舉國一致的要求，亦爲政府人民共同努力的方向。我全國靑年，必須認識原因爲和平的起點，而忍耐爲統一的張本，務要共同一致，爲和平統一而奮鬥。</p>
<p>我們的革命，以民主憲政爲最後的目標，我們在抗戰發動之初，更預期憲政完成與抗戰勝利，畢全力於一役，現在國民政府正在擴大基礎，要求各方面人士的參加，而國民大會即將召開，五權憲法即可制定，我全國靑年必須涵養民主的風度，培植法治的精神，必須協助國家，服務社會，普及國民常識，提高學術水準，以樹立全民政治的楷模。我在三年以前，曾經吿訴我全國靑年：「此次戰爭，亦可以說是文化戰爭，歐聖三百五十年來，民族主義，民生主義，社會主義的成敗興亡，皆在此一役，中國五千年悠久的文化及其道德精神之興廢，亦以此役爲試金石，此戰若不失敗於侵略主義者的魔手，則人類文化即將刮垢磨光，而中國文化自必發揚光大」。現在世界侵略主義者已經覆滅，正是中國文化發揚光大的時機，我們民主的法治，將由此更有堅實的基礎，三民主義自將由此而臻於最後的成功。而我全國優秀的靑年，更要明禮義，知廉恥，來提高我們國民的人格和文化的水準。</p>
<p>全國靑年們，你們的處境是艱苦的，然而你們的前途是光明的，你們的任務是繁重的，然而你們的成就是有把握的。中華民族最殘暴的敵人是打倒了，國民革命最危險的關頭是已經渡過了，只要我全國靑年愛護抗戰勝利的成果，珍重國家獨立平等的地位，自愛自重，自立自强，愛國家，愛民族，負責任，守紀律，而首先致力於和平統一的確保，養成民主法治的習慣，提高學術文化的水準，奠定國家民族長治久安的基礎，團結一致，共同努力，那我們就一定能建設一個三民主義富强康樂的現代國家，來分担世界和平安全的責任，來完成我們國民革命的使命。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐的廿七日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯率其隨員離開安全理事會會塲之戲劇式的決裂，可謂突如其來。先是，葛羅米柯直率通知理事會稱：蘇聯不願在四月十日以前討論此事。蘇聯與伊朗間談判正在進行，不願加以干涉，並堅謂莫斯科與德黑蘭間對撤兵問題至少已成立諒解。美國務卿貝爾納斯稱：美國曾接德黑蘭方面正式報吿，伊蘇問並未成立協定，安全理事會應即聽取伊朗之申訴，勿再延緩。若理事會不受理此案，則聯合國機構將因其無效與無能而致夭殤。美國認爲伊朗案之立即受理，對於聯合國機構前途關係異常重要。葛羅米柯爲埋事會十一國理事中最年輕之外交家，法國代表龐萊則爲一國際聯盟老外交家，當龐氏宣布贊助埃及提議，准許伊朗作口頭陳述時，葛氏即起立宣稱：彼已不復能參加會議，現在即當退出。言訖聲色不動，竟率其隨員離席，大踏步而出，攀登門外之汽車。葛氏此種毫無表情之態度，在其外交界同人間久已著稱。</p>

<h3>振奮革命精神　敬告中國國民黨</h3>
<p>可歌可泣的黃花罔革命先烈紀念日，今天又逢到了！三十五年前的今天，廣州之役，誠如國父所說，「集各省革命黨之精英，與彼虜為後之一搏，事雖不成，而七十二烈士轟轟烈烈之概，已震動全球，國內革命之時勢，實以之造成」。提起黃花罔，人人都承認這是中華民國革命建國史上最偉大壯烈的一幕。國父又說：「七十二烈士死後的酬報，不只是立紀念的石碑，革命成功，中國富强，全國人民都可以享幸福，那就是他們的大酬報」。我們今天在抗戰勝利以後第一次來紀念革命光烈，第一件事便應自問：我們已經使中國富強了沒有？已經使人民都享了幸福沒有？假使我們這些後死者，捫着良心，還不能回答已經做到，那末革命先烈犧牲而後所應得的大酬報實在還沒有得到，這就是革命黨員之恥，也就是中國國民之恥！而這種恥辱之所以存在，乾脆說來，乃山於革命精神的消沉。今天不紀念革命先烈則已，要紀念必得切實從振奮革命精神著手。我們願乘這個寳貴的紀念日，敬吿小國國民黨幾句話。</p>
<p>中國國民黨在改造中國的歷史上，確有其不可磨滅的功績。近百年來的中國史，是一部充滿了辛酸恥辱的歷史。只要是簡略地讀過「中國之命運」第二章的人，沒有不明白國恥的由來與革命的起源的。自興中會同盟會而還，中國國民黨人，團結在國父的革命旗幟之下，站在被壓迫的全國人民的前鋒，為了　造中國而作五十餘年艱苦卓德的奮鬥。他們　　　清，締造民國；他們打倒袁世凱，再造共和；他們掃除軍閥，完成統一，直至暴日侵陵，他們更領導抗戰，苦鬥八年，終於獲得光榮的勝利，而百年恥辱結晶的不平等條約也終於一筆勾消。凡此，都是革命黨人不朽的績業，尤其是革命先烈犧牲的代價。我們紀念先烈，在勝利以後，應該感到很光榮很興奮的了，而今天大家似乎反覺得憂愁焦慮，沉悶抑鬱，彷彿還沒有看見光明一般，這究竟是爲了什麼？我們以爲這病根就在於革命黨人革命精神的消沈！</p>
<p>惟有革命精神振奮飽滿的人，纔具有大無畏的氣魄。亦惟有火無畏，纔可以樂觀邁進，克服一切當前的困難。革命精神不外智仁勇，而一貫之以誠。中國國民黨，原是中國現代史上歷史最長人數最多的一個革命政黨，今後雖可能黨派林立，而國民黨究還不失爲負有領導和平建國的大責的第一大黨。只要國民黨人個個自强，人人互信，精誠團結，努力前進，則任何阻力決不能妨礙新中國建設之成功，國民黨固繼續有其光輝之前途，中國亦必確能成爲一個獨立自主强盛繁榮的新中國。中國與中國國民黨，在近代史上實在已經分不開了。我們老百姓，希望中國眞正成爲一個民主的新中國，也只有希望國民黨人重振其過去一貫之革命精神，先使國民黨成爲一個眞正民主集權的火政黨，然後引着中國走上眞正民主的大道。只有民主團結革新的國民黨，纔是民主統一的新中國的最有力的保證。</p>
<p>中國國民黨所號召的革命是國民革命，而非階級革命。國民革命旣是全民性的革命，故國民黨的政治本質應該是代表全民的，而其政治目的也就在於團結全國人民的力量，建設一個獨立統一民主的新中國。在革命過程中，國民黨也許要斟酌現實，應付環境，也許可以稍稍改變其建國程序，而就革命的理想來說，國民黨決不能改變其實行三民主義的最大止的。為了實現民族主義的理想，國民黨應願意使中國與世界各民族平等相處，而決不願意見中國作任何一個異族的附庸。爲了實現民權主義的理想，國民黨應該堅守其五權憲法「權能分職」，「五權獨立」的立塲，釐訂制度，而法不可隨便遷就，落人窠白，以議會政治或階級專政的假民主粉飾了事。爲了實現民生主義的理想，國民黨應該本着勞資協調社會互助的方針，趕快實行平均地權節制資本的具體辦法，而決不可放任因循，畏首畏尾，坐視物價騰漲，工潮　起，以致社會騷動，民不聊生，授國際第五縱隊陰謀滅亡中國以可乘之隙！國民黨人能自强，能互信。能堅守三民主義的寳貴原則，處處爲人民着想，時時爲國家打算，凡有益於國，有利於民的事，不管任何艱難，都任勞任怨的去幹，凡有禍於國有害於民的舉動，不問來自何方，出自何人，都得竭力排除，芟夷務盡，則全國人民沒有不跟着國民黨來致力於國家的建設的。吾則，如果只唱好調，不做好事，自己軟弱無能，徒以數衍遷就爲事，則革命精神淪胥以盡，還有什麽指望呢？</p>
<p>今天我們紀念革命先烈，想到民國締造之艱難，不能不對國民黨致其最誠懇最深切的期望。國民黨振奮起革命精神來，政府一定有力；政府有力量，國家當前內內外外的許多大問題自可迎刃而解。國民政府不久擴大組織，制憲的國民大會也行將召開，中國目前又已面臨了第二次開國之前夜，我們眞需要實花罔革命先烈的精神，能夠普及於所有國民黨人，列由國民黨人而普及於全國受國的表年。先烈之血，革命之花，清溉審衍的結果，一切腐惡勢力必爲此革命精神所掃蕩。而國父所說「中國富强，全國人民都享幸福」，先烈的大酬報也終有一天可以圓滿得到！</p>

<h3>四十八個會員國　應厲行糧食統制　並於必要時實施配給　聯總糧食委會通過決議案</h3>

<p>中央印製廠滬廠第一·第三·第四·三印刷所全體工人，於二十五日起，先後怠工，迄未解次。記者走訪該廠負責人，據謂此次工潮，事出突然，事前旣未聞工方有所不滿之表示，事後又未正式提出要求進行談判。事起之日，且有一部份工人照常工作，旋爲其他工人阻止，始行停工。廠方曾數度勸令復工，並表示如有要求，儘可提出商談，社會局聞訊，亦曾派員至各所調查，以便進行調解。但工方旣不推派代表，復無具體之要求，致無結果，而陷於僵局。廠方經已將經過情形，報吿市政府及市社會局等，聽候解決。聞工方至二十七日，始有呈文遞基市社會局及市總工會，陳述怠工原因，並提出改善待遇，改照生活指數計算工資等五項要求。又聞廠方以國營事業，依法不許罷工怠工，曾限令於昨日復工。如不願復工者，作爲自動離職云。</p>

<h3>拋出統內三百萬　結果一逃了事　請看投機的下塲！</h3>
<p>公債自前日發現新高峯後，某大戶拋空統丙三百萬，因受擠軋，心有不甘，一走了事，操業者拖累多家，昨市集會停止，籌議對策，是以並無大宗做開，僅在走廊上稍有黑黑市之讓受，大致雜牌微挫，丙種仍見扳高，惟可靠性較少，華股昨極度恍惚，良以今日銀行休業，明日又逢週六，操業者爲避免風險，火部份本週交易做至昨日結束，下週一起再度恢復，因此多方頗有出籠，中途疲象屢起，午刻仍被拉上，午收結果熟門大股稍有降落，小股則再升半成，冷門各股則以底價便宜，吸收者多，價再見高，尤以小型更受青睞，軋漲二成左右，午後因封關之故，期貨並無做開，外股亦與華股情形相同，小股略好，大股除會德豐外，餘略見低。</p>
<h3>金價續挫　將易寂寥</h3>
<p>烚赤昨依然平疲，起仆狹窄，交易不多，市况倍形冷落，晨開平盤，開後即露供過於求，而吿小挫，中行配給價未更，業中自無登記之理，人後更見一五二萬低價，而後稍定，午刻在一五三萬前後，午後更爲岑寂，結果較前收跌一萬五，飾金掛十六萬八，紋銀一千六，銀元一一五〇元有賣，暗拆因投機商紛紛了結，銀根大鬆，息價昨退至一角半至一角八分。</p>
<h3>新港票轉疲　美鈔穏定</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔尙形穩定，並不因金市下降而遜色，良以美參院對白銀價保持原價，則提高金價當亦無望，且有等棉花結款，未能合格邀准，進口商對美鈔仍有依賴，對黄金仍保持七八〇元對十兩，有再形軋攏之趨勢，最高一九七〇元左右，最低亦不過一九六〇元光景而已，午刻及午後甚爲穩定，較之前收微挫十元，港票老貨初見四二〇元以下，而後被電匯稍稍帶上，結果仍挫五元，新貨平疲，三十六年（一）字頭較前收無榮辱，惟（二）字頭及三十七年以需要者少，則跌十元，差價拔開，港電四四〇元，羅比五四〇元。</p>
<h3>外匯經紀人　申請調整用金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯經紀人十六家，自開始營業後，對中央銀行所定之佣金率，時嫌太低，中央銀行曾表示此項佣金率，先行試辦一個月，然後再酌情申請調整，茲一月之期，瞬將屆滿，各外匯經紀人正擬申請調整，聞新佣金率經各指定銀行會商認可後，即可交由中央銀行批准實行。</p>
<p>又據，據中行負責當局稱，現全國各地對外結匯事宜，均可彙集上海辦理，故目前各地外匯市塲之個別開放，尚無需要，一俟結匯繁多，業務上有必需時，常即考慮上放。</p>
<h3>紡建標價降低　紗花交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉入穩境，粤帮對念支高身貨仍有納胃，廿支雙馬屹立於一百十三四萬之間，十六支光明亦稍升一萬餘元，細紗仍形平常，午時紡建公司照例縣牌，四十二支慶股綫又掛小七萬，四十支少女標價一八八萬，竟較二十五日所標行市低三十六萬之多，其餘各支紗無不標低數萬，業中人鑒於該公司一再貶售，似有不敢問鼎之槪，紡建今日休假星期六開售棉布及蔴呢製品云。</p>
<p>昨日紐的美棉漲跌不一，市價近堅遠疲，上下十一至十六磅音，計近期美金二七·一三，遠期二七·〇二，米特林現貨無市，本埠現棉交易仍然淸淡，僅民營中新第五廠採辦細絨花原料四百包，計大中集價九萬四千元，又米特林價八萬六千元，以上均送廠價，此外紡建公司曁民營紗廠及花號等均存觀望，未有舉動，（二十九日為黃花崗紀念，紗布兩市場循例休會一天，）大都須俟開關後再作買賣云。</p>
<h3>布市漸有生氣</h3>

<p>染織廠對印花洋紗，素色洋紗，頻有發染，備貨相當股厚，一俟氣候暖和，即將發動大規模之攻勢。</p>
<h3>防雨布現貨缺乏</h3>
<p>呢絨交易，昨除中紡五百號嗶嘰尚見活躍外，餘增起色，惟雨衣材料之防雨布，實銷大盛，西服帮及雨衣作塲進胃均健，惜市貨甚爲缺乏，一搜求不易，行情較前又漲高三五百元一碼。</p>
<h3>爪哇之茶與糖　茶葉產量已較前減少　存糧約一百四十萬噸</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿八日電〕據估計爪哇種茶塲二百六十萬英畝，一九四二年被日人接收而述根拔除者，佔百分之廿二，一九四五年中未被毁壞之種茶塲計十三萬四千英畝，一九四四年爪哇茶葉產額總計三百四十萬公斤，較一九四三年之產額减少九十萬公斤，一九四一年存在之茶廠二百二十所中，五十所仍繼續開工，餘則有被毁滅者，有改製織物及炸藥藥者，在蘇門答臘東海岸之種茶塲總計五萬四千突畝，其中被連根拔除者一萬五千英畝，剪去小枝者三千英畝，一九四四年蘇門答臘之茶葉產量估計六百萬公斤，祇及一九四一年產量之百分之十。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕據調査所得，爪哇現有存糖的一百四十萬噸，內地可能尙有若干，目下尙未大量運出，但此項存糖與全世界食糖之缺乏情形相較，數量顯屬不多，按照本年初之估計，一九四五—四六年度食糖產額大致爲二千四百六十萬噸，而戰前之消費量爲三千萬噸，全世界食糖存量目下不得而知，但較戰前數字必相差甚巨，權威方面認爲食糖一部份恢復自由買賣，尙須相當時日。</p>
<h3>絲綢繼續疲弱</h3>
<p>昨市廠絲八十分勻度五担頭成交價二百四十五萬元，普通廠絲喊價俱短，干經稍有去路，價與上日相仿，人造絲一二〇號天橋一百五十八萬元開盤，一百六十一萬元收盤，較上日價上落甚微，七五號有光成交價二百五十萬元，綢市一致短小，美亞被面每百條一百〇六萬元，比上日小去八九萬元，且交易仍稀少，大誠格子璧縐每碼做價又短三十元，盛澤貨各　亦均疲軟。</p>
<h3>米價漸小油豆餅均疲</h3>
<p>米市消化呆滯，轉入疲境，粳秞均見下挫五六百元，白元胃呆價小千元，陰元貨湧消細，苦無受主，價跌一千元，麵粉供求兩少，甬帮動而不旺，價形暫定，麩皮去化不振，下降二三百元，豆餅實消不動，常州無錫油廠續有出售，納戶觀望，價格再小三四百元，黄豆本街零星成交不多，外埠乏人顧問，中下跌六七百元，高貨平定，油市以各路來源尙續，生油仍少樂觀，豆油依然挺站，天晴米價再有續小之望。</p>
<h3>皖北爆裂雜到滬</h3>

<h3>白煤市競爭疲軟　煙煤盤旋微升</h3>
<p>煤市白煤市氣虛怯，篩塊價在軟檔盤旋，續見微挫，煤屑聞煤球業客製造廠將有鴻基層配給，交易沉寂，市價疲軟，烟煤篩塊，供銷平衡，行市鮮有變動，烟煤層同業存底並不豐裕，但自各廠獲有配給以來，銷路大减，市價乃急轉直下，現已跌近配給價格，致各持貨者，均不甘賤脫，故稍經搜購，價即喊高，市呈盤旋之局，各貨終見微升，柴炭因天雨，到貨潮濕不堪，難以應銷，同業多不願購進，故銷路呆滯，市價趨疲，河溪江炭，每担一萬七千元，松柴每担四千三百元有賣。</p>
<h3>舶來電料傾銷　國貨不易維持</h3>
<p>全面復員國內需用常工器材日多，滬市之各較大電工器材製造廠，現猶在堅苦中掙扎，據資源委會中央電工器材廠滬廠負責人談稱，該廠在滬接收之敵偽電工廠計六個單位，規模均小，早經開工，所製造之成品有銅綫，皮綫，花綫，變壓器，馬達，電銅，銅皮等，其所採用之原料，除銅類及紗錢等可就本市搜購外，所需之舶來原料亦多，兼以工價高漲，凡製成品出售得價，僅數成本，而近來英商在滬拋售預訂各種電料器材甚多，售價較滬現市的低五分之三四，如將來預訂貨品抵埠，貨源充塞，市價必受相當影響，屆時本市之電工廠將無法與之競爭，因此華成，華生，華通等廠目前均未開工，僅華德廠製造燈泡。</p>

<h3>為滅少人民損失起見　統債應遭定適當措置</h3>
<p>— 敬之</p>
<p>統債黑市自證火樓老巢被剿，遷往華僑大樓後，應做愈高興，雖有兪財長之書面聲明，近日依然迭創高峯，其種種交割上之重重挑剔，早已分誌本報，數年來倒帳結價，時有所聞，一般客戶屢蒙損失，而毫無法律上之保障，前日創造新高價後，又有某大戶拋售丙種票面三百餘萬，並不履行交割手續，各有關號家候至深夜，朱能解決，我人對提高國債信譽，極表贊同，但另一方面當顧及法幣地位，（統債票面註明國幣本位，但戰前所發行之法倍，亦印有憑票即付國幣若干者），回屬統債，雜牌低落一半　未連三十一年度息票，以及票而稍有汚跡，或票而在千元以下者，不成上萬整數者，均無受主，統丙之爲投機操縱，其理固昭然若揭，兪財長旣有聲明，我人希望當局速定適當之措置，因爲現下從事公債投機者，均屬一般雜色州〇散游資，皮球愈踢愈高。最後之持有人所受之損害亦愈大，政府旣無法制止債市活動，則減少人民意外損失，實屬責無旁貸。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕私立中小學聯合會理事蔣紀周等，於昨日上午赴市敎育局，謁見李副局長熙謀，陳述私校經濟困難情形，略謂：私立各校學費，係遵照市敎局指示，參照市校教職員待遇，以小學敎帥月薪三萬元，中學敎職員月薪四萬元爲標準所微收。邇來本市物價突飛猛進，敎局於一月間規定學費數額時，生活指數爲二十五年度之五百二十倍，至本學期開學收費，生活指數已高至一千八百餘倍，今則已逾二千倍。私校敎職員薪金不及普通工人之半，食不飽，表不暖，請求市政當局補助私校，並准予續收第二次學費。李副局長對於私校困難狀况，極爲關切，當發表意見，謂關於私校請求政府補助，市府已核定五千四百萬元，本局擬呈請加撥，至於私校收取第二次學費，亦正在考慮，以解除私校當前困難云。</p>

<h3>針對政協次議與各地現况　參政員慷慨陳詞</h3>
<p>— 本報廿四日航訊重慶特約記者趙洪生寄</p>
<p>對於政治協商會議問題，參政會中早就有着一種密雲不雨的空氣。參政員們來自全國各地，用地方現實來衡量政治協商會藝種種，也無怪乎是要有滿腔悲憤。吳貽芳先生主持大會，也許只有她的才能和力量，才能控制住羣眾的感情不致混亂。</p>
<p>決心實現決議</p>
<p>邵力子先生手頭拿着一份載有政協會閉幕及決議全文的報紙作戰告，他不斷引用蔣主席的話，來說明政協會所談各種問題的重要性。他的眼鏡法而復載，他的音調越來越高。最後他說他要代表政府表示，政府對各決議案，有絕對求其實現的決心。外圖各黨派所傳的一切謠言，皆不可言。</p>
<p>接接着張星作與政協有關的停止軍事衝突，恢復交通，暨軍隊　綸，及統籌中共軍隊方案報告。大疊的詢問案開始宣讀。第一位宣讀的人聲音表情很好，能把又字的感情極生動的傳達出來。</p>
<p>張樂古叙述停止衝突後青島市外的共軍第五旅十五團前進百餘里，二月二十六日進入青市。他問協商會議決議是否能眞實實現？薩孟武詢問，參加會議的有各黨派外，及尚有無黨派代表，現在全國有四萬萬以上都是無黨派的，請問這些代表，是代表哪一部份無黨派？全塲大笑起來。</p>
<p>「口袋隊」活動</p>
<p>張良修間國大代表增加名額，代表民意的參政會竟沒有了下落，他感到沒有黨派太吃虧。王國源問該會是根據什麼法律產生？一黨一派少數政咨野心家如何能代表全國人民？他主張新增國大代表應合理選舉，以黨派力量大小分配，實在滑稽。他澈底反對這一切，主張取消這一切非法決叢，張志廣參政員說，自該會「圓滿」閉幕後，並沒有贏得和平安定，共產黨應藉此胡作非為，他們在「解放區」施行許多奇而且怪的政策，諸如到處搶吃的「聞警隊」，專作特務的「聽房隊」，搜掠民食的「口袋隊」，夫婦一吵架，就鼓動他們離婚，各極騷擾，比敵偽當年更利害。</p>
<p>痛哭流涕致敬</p>
<p>馬　鳳說明他聽了報告以後，站在人民與良心的立場，不能不說幾句話。他詢問自協商會議閉　後，交通恢復了沒有？共產黨對鎖的地區開放了沒有？軍會政會統一了沒有？……他肯定的說：完全沒有！事實上是更惡化，更糟糕！他說政協一切決議，僅僅是一篇白字，上寫着黑字的天書，最後他以人民身份向這一切決議敬致「痛哭流涕之敬禮！」譚平由用他顫巍巍的手寫着，這一切決議，是否是共同遵守？</p>
<p>這是商而不協</p>
<p>張守約說，政協會後，糾紛是越來越多，你容忍我不容忍，你退讓我不退讓，他問全國各大報在「解放區」能銷多少？那裏有新聞自由嗎？各黨派能不能在那裏活動？某參政員提出對政協決議要求以國民良心作總公判！這樣的會，是不是成為一般人組織政黨謀官的捷經？如果將來兩三個人就組織個政黨向政府要官做，請問政府如何應付？所謂社會賢達以甚麼為標準，現在社會上究竟有多少賢達？趙公魯也問所謂賢達以什麼去衡景人民對他們是不是放心？他更說到協商會閉幕九天內，共產黨就攻陷十九萬，剛才邵力于先生所說的「成功」在那裏？吳蘊初問國大新代表各黨派佔百分之九十，把人民放到那裏去？譚平山說這是「商而不協」，何葆仁說這眞是「奇而且怪」的民主，民主同盟的國大代表人數，是比他所能代表的人民還要多！陳紀　問政協會各決議，要通過各黨派最高權利機關，是不是還要通過代表民意的機關？他更提到東北共軍何時才能縮編？李鈺說制憲行憲，是國民大會應有的職權，協商會中竟作制憲工作，有甚麼法律根據？李鑑之說所謂軍隊國家化，實在是軍隊分化國家。</p>
<p>賢達未免太少</p>
<p>廖學　寫着：國大代表中，社會賢達僅分配七十名，當年孔門弟子三千人即有七中二賢，現在中國人口有數萬萬，七十二賢的子孫反覆增加，數目一定可觀，今國大代表社會賢達僅七十二人，比孔門賢者尚少兩個，未免太少了。又一位參政員問，政協代表們看到今天新華日報的消息嗎？協商會議能不能使全國人安居樂業？實在有問題。</p>
<p>通過特審委會</p>
<p>三十四件書面詢間，多半是來自各地的參政員提出的，一致是不滿的聲音，宣讀完畢後主席站起來報告另有尹述賢等六十餘人提出之臨時動機，要求大會組織特種審查委員會，審查政協會問題，當天出席參政員一五八人，以一四八票通過。</p>
<p>口頭詢問第一位是孔令燦，他歷述共產黨在各地强迫人民遷居，以斷絕人民的社會關係，抗戰期間，人民是「有家難歸」現在是「無家訂歸」了，他們更在各地，强迫男女亂配，擾亂整個社會秩序，凡此種種，大家都應該注意。王普涵說，在協商會議中，只見黨派，不見人民，國大代表產生方法，來歷不明，他自己雖為舊國大代表，對此保全舊代表所作之大讓步，也感到不滿。伍純武說，在協商會議中，只聽說爭國大代表，國府委員，……很少提及交通，復員，物價等等眞正解決人民痛苦的事情。</p>
<p>鬧嚷復歸平靜</p>
<p>陶向川發　中解　政協會之召開，是解決勝利後的特殊政治問題的唯一辦法，應當認為是成功的。他的話，引起了大　動，以致沒有說完，就被一片亂雜的聲音淹沒了。主席起來維持秩序，馬重風喊前：「主席自己先犯法，為甚麼你的錶忽快忽慢？」主席平靜的回答他：「延長一點鐘，是援昨天的例，會塲秩序，請大家必須遵守。」鬧嚷終於平靜，時間已到十一點，但要發言的人還很多如何辦理，結果又是援例延長一小時。</p>
<p>王立哉問「解放區」作何解釋？蘇　說：美國是老牌民主國，麥克阿瑟就是共和黨員，為什麼協商會剝奪軍人入黨的權利？對於憲草問題，還有更多的人發　。</p>
<p>五分鐘的要求</p>
<p>最後，邵力子請求五分鐘答覆，有人以時間太晚，請他在審查會上講，他說：現在新聞記者在座正好請給大家聽聽。他的答覆分六點：（一）政協會召開，是根據本屆第一次參政會對國大的決議，由主席召開，且經國防最高委員會中常會通過，（二）代表中，除政府方面外，三十人內，僅六位不是參政員。（三）日前困難實在使人傷心，但困難要大家克服。（四）地方政權只是暫時狀態，將來當然要改善。（五）憲草在國大通過一事，是各黨派約束自己的黨員的辦法。（六）本屆國大制憲不行憲，是二十六年國府頒佈的法令。</p>
<p>激辯就此結束，主席如釋重負的站起來，宣佈散會。</p>
<h3>建國時期大動脈　西北公路</h3>
<p>— 本報十七日航訊陳前寄自蘭州</p>
<p>現屆積極復員之期，國人對於西北似不無淡忘之嫌，其實西北之重要性，人人盡知，勿容記者再拾人唾餘，重說一遍，但若對於整個大西北還不十分了解，就談不到有深刻的認識，不過人在這裏，聞見所及。姑且一談吧。本文專為西北公路而寫，也是東拉西扯，當然不如「官方統計」那撥精確，所以本文也可以說拋磚引玉，希望有懂得更多寫得更好的明達，為我指正。西北公路交通路綫，因為局址在蘭州，甘肅青海兩地當然是通車地方，此外則為西接新疆，東貫陝西。河南。湖北，南通四川，北上綏遠。寗夏等省，現在都有車可通，如果進一步說，新修成的南疆公路，青藏公路，也包括在內，一旦順利通車，國際路綫，也可以在這兩地開闢了。</p>
<p>公路管埋機構</p>
<p>沿革紛繁</p>
<p>西北公路管理機構，於廿三年四月間始有西北公路管理局籌備處之設立，當時管轄區域僅西蘭公路一綫，隸屬於全國維濟委員會。嗣復改為西北國營公路管理局，管轄區除西蘭外，尚有風漢寗一綫。當時局長目前上海市工務局局長趙祖康先生，局址設在西安。廿六年後方移址蘭州，專　國際軍運事宜，同時並擴大管轄，復增加甘青一綫，而先後又有西北公路運輸處，陝甘運輸管理局等之改稱。上述各處局，均係　屬全國羅濟委員會或該會之西北辦事專員辦事處。至廿七年一月，方行改隸於交通部，復更名為交通部西北運輸管理局。此時屬綫為蘭西。蘭猩。甘青。華雙。鳳漢寗。漢白等六個路綫，長幾三千餘公里。業務之發展，運輸之繁忙，為該路黃金時代，後於卅一年間復各改隸於軍事委員會運輸統制局，卅三年則又隸於交通部之公路總局，卅四年春復該組為軍事委員會戰昤運輸管理局西北公路管理局，除仍辦原有運輸業務外，並辦理監理工務，驛運事宜。本年春，則又重行歸園交通部公路總局管轄，綜上述之各局處，在十年中都十一二次之改隸，每年中均在辦理移接手續，不僅忙壞辦理總務人員，即其他人員亦時在凖備清冊，凖備新局長到任，而中國事多偽「一朝天子一朝臣」，下級職員迎新送舊，亦不勝其煩。這樣繁雜的改來改去，眞是奇聞。該路現在屬綫，計有蘭州至　猩峽之蘭猩路，蘭州至西寗之廿青路。</p>
<p>蘭州至西安之蘭西路，華家嶺至雙石舖之華雙路，平凉至陝壩之軍寗綏路，漢中至自河之漢白路，實鷄至廣元之寶廣路，（即前鳳漢憲），平凉至實鷄之平實路，蘭州至臨洮之蘭臨路（此綫現在又擴展為籣州到岷縣之蘭岷路）等旅客個由蘭州起點往各地之里程，約如下述：至西安為七一九公里，至廣元為九四三公里，至哈密為一三九〇公里，至敦煌為一一六一公里，至寗夏為八七九公里，至陝壩為取二四六公里，至西寗為二三六公里，至白河為一二八四公里，至重慶為一五六五公里，至迪化為一一〇二公里，至老河口為一五二一公司。現在尚聞有行駛南疆公路之說。路局這次為了實天鐵路完工，接運軍公商品反客運等開往天水的車特多，將來如果天蘭鐵路修到這裏時，恐怕那時蘭州以西的運務要更加緊了。</p>
<p>參觀路局外圍</p>
<p>需時三天</p>
<p>該局設最蘭　之左公路，路旁　植白楊，向西北是有一條國際馬路，局址係城隍的行宮所改建，環列有所屬之籣州醫院，蘭州分站，蘭州機廠供應社，服務處，托兒所，理髮室，新生宿舍，四北新村嚀，又交通部之扶輪小學校，西北公路特別黨部，西北公路工會，西北大厦等，亦在隣居之列，佔地頗廣，如果你要參觀路局的外圍必須花你三天工夫，內部呢？正副局長之下，分組辦事，現設運務，工務，機務，材料，會設，總務，驚稽等組，並設有驛運處一所，專司騾馬駱駝，膠車為管理獸力運輸之機構。該局局址為靠山建屋，山上「四墩坪」為則清有名之軍事建築物，極為雄偉壯嚴，同仁於公餘，時時舉行爬山比賽，鍛練身體。現在春天到了，員工的子弟們也都爬上頂峯，放起風箏，競奇鬥巧，至為熱鬧。</p>
<p>當着我們與鬼子決殊死戰時，西北公路之地位亦日趨重要，我們現在不是「論功行賞，」單說該路所屬員工服楞精神，即已大堪欽佩。無論是關內關外，瀚海沙漢，窮鄉僻壤，冰天雪地，都有他們的尼跡，為什麼呢？那都是堅苦卓絕的「交通鬥士，」眞正的為國効勞。記得宋希尚先生曾為久說到該局在航戰中遭遇之重大事件，可得而記述者，凡六項：（一）國際運輸，（二）川陝軍運，（三）各戲誡軍運，　疏散物我及難民，（五）奉移成靈（六）擴大路線籌。繼宋氏後，有何兢武先生為局長，在何氏主持期間，記者會補充如下各點：（一）運送移民入新，（二）天成新運，（三）修造舊車與整理舊科，（四）擴華英軍，（五）建築西北大　與西北新村，（六）實　員工軍事管理等。</p>
<p>像老牛拉破車</p>
<p>處長苦幹</p>
<p>在何先生襯長期間，也是該　有聲有色全盛時期，當着何氏上毫之際，適逢其愈也是隴海鐵路改組之時，本來幹鐵路的人是說「機械」活，吃一董子「鐵飯碗」，誰看得起公路呢？而且幹鐵路的人常常說拉一列火車，夠你汽車運一年，可是何氏却特別借重了隴海路的大五處長，這五位也都像老牛拉着破車，埋頭苦幹，隴海鐵路五大處長如下：車務處處長黃兆桐，機務處處長孫繼丁，會計處處長黃日新，工務處處長　儼，總務隊　長余士戲，這五位老漢在交通界服務，都有三四十年歷史，而且也都是白頭老翁在六十歲上下年紀，與日下交通部次長凌鴻勛都是老朋友。他們先後都被邀來蘭，都有一種苦幹精神。在抗戰時間的員工，當然每個人也都盡其能方，畫夜辛勤，才能夠完成這偉大的運輸使命，我更希望在建國期間的西北公路。有更多的貢獻。</p>
<p>該路雖然地　邊境，其實車輛所到地方，也都是秦漢二代經營且為開化最早的地方，我們如榮走遍全路，一覽勝蹟，追慕古人之心情必油然而生，且必能使我人歡欣鼓舞。</p>
<p>這裏不僅是風景幽美，而且是國防大動脈。你如果不相信，且請你來此一遊。</p>
<p>莫淡忘了西北</p>
<p>責無旁貸</p>
<p>在卅一年前後民族奮鬥期間，西南一度也受到威脅，所以「開發西北」這口號喊得特別響。每天天上以聽得機聲隆隆，忽上忽下，市內的小座車也風馳電　，那都是「朝辭嘉陵江，夜宿黃河邊」的人物，不是考察便是逃視。現在呢，是寂寂無聳，豈不是淡忘西北了嗎？且下許多公務員，為了「復員」，竟也都紛紛「告退」，「歸田」，難道「開發西北」真已開發完了嗎？記者還要告訴你：你雖然沒有見到大西北地下蘊藏萬千的礦產，當待開發，可是可以眼前望到的××油礦，××煤礦，隴西藥材，草地牛羊，這都是建國的資源，還有西寧塔爾寺的金瓦，據說值得賠償庚款的二倍數目，還有那被外人偷竊的敦煌國寶：……試想：誰應該負起「開發西北」的責任呢？誰應該負起保藏先人遺業的責任呢？</p>

<h3>整軍建國聲中的兵士呼聲</h3>
<p>主筆先生：在本部行將調赴東北的前夕，本人有幾點意見，想借貴報一角，呈獻於有關當局及國人的面前。</p>
<p>因為我們是軍人，我們不能為自己呼籲，不管怎樣的艱苦危險，我們祗是咬緊牙關在忍受着。尤其在八年抗戰的過程中，身受着常人未經之苦，歷世間極目之慘，終年她　於荒野的戰地，飢不得食，寒不得衣，即是正常的生活，（每頓祗吃兩碗糙米飯，喝幾口鹽菜湯，）以致體　，力簿，還要奔波跋涉，到處迎擊着敵人瘋狂的進攻，始終在為着他國而奮鬥。流血，　年來如一日，因為這是時代所付予我們的使命，是不能旁貸的。</p>
<p>頓目前事實，勝　後已經七個月了，在整軍的原則下，好多部隊，己經開始調整，前幾天好多地方，不得徘徊着很多三五成羣衣服襤褸的淘汰兵嗎，他們為國家奮鬥了八年。現在年紀大了，身體殘疾了。不中用了。每人發給法幣一千元，着其另諜他業，前日余因事路過京滬車站，見　之一側，坐着一身穿灰色軍服之殘廢士兵，面容憔悴，沿路求乞，據他說：還是在武漢會戰負傷的，現傷雖好，而原部因歷次作戰，不知何往？自已身體殘疾，又不能做工，可是有誰表同情，更有誰來說一句：他為國家。為同胞。而犧牲自己的良心話，賜予他的，還不是和普通乞者，同樣的白眼，當時的我，真是百感交集，以一抗戰受傷的軍人，竟是這樣的下塲啊！</p>
<p>在這百貨昂貴的今日，物價一日千里，政府既無法抑止物價的上漲，又不提高待遇，試問每一二等兵，月餉一千元，（僅夠買數包紙烟，還不剃頭，洗澡。一切零用，）副食費每日官兵一百元，包括（業。　。菜。）過去不論月大月小，都按卅天發，據說：好算帳，今年却不同，月大還發卅天，二月平祗有廿八日，多兩日却扣起來，這種不合理的現象，不知是誰發明的。</p>
<p>就現狀來說吧：在中央政令沒有推行的地方，我們且不去講，即是地近首都的京滬一綫，又有誰作一次實際出征軍人家屬豈問與接濟？輾轉於街頭巷尾，還不是我那可憐無依哀子，失父，之寡母孤兒，昔日我們身陷戰地，看不到他們的痛昔，也無法過問，現在在這勝利後萬民交樂的今日，一些發國難洋財們，反日揮千金，珍餚百味，即是販夫走卒，也能飽食暖衣，我們這批為國拼命的軍人家屬，反而終日掙扎於飢餓綫上，無人過問，言念及此，不勝感慨。雖然『領土未復，責在軍人，」然而「國家興亡，匹夫有責，」我們原不是生來頭上刻有軍人兩個字的，我們都是在抗戰期中成長的軍人，都是熱血所趨而自願的軍人。總之，東北的存亡，即中國的存亡，國軍士氣的妓舞，素質的精銳，可以影響東北接收的順利，這是無可諱言的事實，最近調赴東北部隊逃兵的增多，其原因不是因為士兵怕死或怕苦，若謂怕死的話，他們也曾追隨部隊作戰各地，也曾擊潰舉世陸軍第二的日本軍閥，因此，深希當局，唯一迫切的，便是　人家屬的接濟，最低限度不使其流離失所，而安士兵之心，本身的痛苦，是在所不計的，正因為我們的士矢，都來自貧寒家庭。</p>
<p>最後，我們知道，現在的時代，正是物競天擇的時代，誰能夠跑到時代的前面，誰便是先進者。保守。舞弊。自私。牟利。的行為，可以影響國家的前途，自身的缺點，我們應毫不客氣的指摘出來，因為我們也是國家的一員啊！（祁憶　）</p>

<h3>寫在工展閉幕以前</h3>
<p>— 施汶</p>
<p>一個團體的組成，或是一件事業的成就，大抵就是各方面人才的組合；並且這一種組合所產生的力量，往往超過了各個個別才能的總和。上海工業品展覧會的這些成績，就是在這個一致信念下促成的。八年以來，中國的民族工業不論在後方或是淪陷區，都不曾得到長足的進步；淪陷　區果然不必談，大後方亦受到種種的限制。等到抗戰勝利，更呈出穿前蕭條約景象。是這樣的時候，中國按術協會在此地，上海，這個足以代表中國工業的地方，舉辦第一次的「上少工業品展覧會，想從此號召迅速全國工來化。」</p>
<p>今天，展覧會已臨　到閉幕的前夕，五天以來憶經有超過四萬觀眾參加了這個展覧會，誠然，這確實是出乎當初的預料。因為正偈許多人雨一樣，現在不是工業展覧的時候，然而，又是什麼造成今天的熱鬧和一繁深」？</p>
<p>我們認爲惟其發自民間，才會這樣熟鬧，才會這樣榮榮。經過抗戰的洗鍊人民是站起來了，他們要找出一條眞正當國强民的大道，於是全國工業化便成爲一致的口號，一致的目標。所以有一個以工業品標榜的展覧會，已經是够吸引的了，儘管中國是怎樣的沒有工業，儘管上海又是如何的不景氣，每一個關心祖國前途的，者想從這裏探求新中國的遠景。</p>
<p>可是在「熱鬧」與「繁榮」的後面，我們看到：</p>
<p>參加展覽的廠商，因爲處在經濟制度極度不安定的狀態下，全都有無法繼續生產的感覺。即使技術改進很成功的大明速印機，雖然在會塲上吸引了廣大的觀衆，還是因爲生產成本超過市價的緣故，不能大量生產。因此在這一次工業品展覧會閉幕以前，，我們深深的感覺到，技術的改進，果然是促成工業建設的要素，然而要是對於這一批工業界的戰士，不加以最低限度的保障，要想繼續不斷的改進是不可能的。</p>
<p>本會同人，通過這次展覽會，有機會與工業家直接接觸，佩服他們的苦鬥精神，這批對國家忠心，對工業有興趣的人，是不易培養的，不要使他們灰心，不要辜負了他們！</p>
<h3>我們的感奮和歉疚</h3>
<p>— 王天一</p>
<p>無論是技協約會員或者不是，沒有對於這次上海工業品展覽會的盛况不激動的，我們負責籌備的工作同人，尤其有着異常的興奮，興奮得把過去四個月的疲癆和酸辛全都忘却。不是嗎？抗戰勝利以後，我們有過一度的興奮，但是經過試騐以後，這與奮就證明是空虛。從空虛到黯淡，到現在我們還不曾脫離這黯淡的日子。但是今天，對於每一個願意把自己和祖國緊緊着的人們，展覽會無疑透露給他一綫希望。記着，這是勝利後七個月，第一個建設性的積一極的樂觀的象徵，從這裏我們看見偉大新中國的生機。</p>
<p>不要以爲這一點點成績爲微薄，這是上海工業界布敵僞壓制，物價動蕩下的汗血的陶鑄。只要熟悉戰前上海工業的先生們都可以承認，這八年以後表現的上海工業，尤其是在技術方面，只有進步，幷無衰退，有許多機械和製品是前所未有的。所以一個很顯明的啓示，就是中國工業的發展，關逃幷不在乎技術方面，中國人的智力根本幷不讓後人！</p>
<p>請再留心一下這次展覽會的觀衆，靑年的智識份子之外，有容顏憔悴的老年人，也有朝氣勃勃的小朋友，士兵同志，公敎人員，職業的和家庭的婦女，他們都到上海工業品展覽會來了。這裏沒有幻術，不是娛樂，這裏所陳列的都是實物，所說明的沒有事理的例證，便是實際的經歷。爲什麽這樣轟動啊？一個很簡單的理由，就是他們也要工業化。科學和工程把世界的空問縮短了，中國人很容易的聽得別國的呼吸利脈搏。看他們那樣健康愉快地生活在現代化的環境中，復員大得完成，新建設計畫逐漸關始，而我們却遲遲其步伐，那個人不想改善生活啊，那個人，不想國家强盛一些啊？工業化已是人民的要求，誰都不能再在建國的工作之前放絆脚石不了，醒醒吧，尤其是那些責任顯得史重的大人先生們。</p>
<p>所以看見這回工業品展覽會的情形，我們沒有理由再不感奮。我們深幸一個小小的動機，竟然引起廣大各階層的同情和共鳴。似乎每一位參觀的先生們把信次展覽會和現在工業的缺點都在容忍着不說，展覽曾和上海的工業幷不是沒有缺點，相反地而且很多，但是現在相忍爲國的風氣好像很普遍，大家都知道中國的工業只許培植，不容摧殘，只許獎勵，不應壓制。</p>
<p>然而因此我們也有　無窮的歉疚。籌備的時間和工作　然不够充分，便有許多廠商不及參加，展覽的場地和期間，都顯得狹小，使我們在接待方面很多不周的地方，我們連騰出一兩天時間專門招待各校學生的時間都沒有。這裏我們敬謹誌深刻的抱歉和負疚。所可以吿　於我們的同胞的，這次工業各展覽的目的是部分地完成了。我們每天在場內感到一種熱熾的空氣，相信這種空氣幷將漫衍出去，到達全國的各隅。在這個空氣，生機的培養是比校容易些了。幷且，因爲這次展覽會的啓示，我們已經預備進行民國卅六年的工業展覽會，在那個展覽會裏我們相信規模一點更大，時期塲地一定更寬裕，敎育和建設的意義更濃厚，可以矜耀的地方也可以增多，我們有此信念，我們也可以確定其成功。</p>
<p>如今，這一回的展覽會已成尾聲，願自此爲始，我們分頭去努力，姑以一年爲期到那時候，我們再有一個愉快健康的相見。</p>
<h3>會塲上</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>1.澱粉是甜的嗎？</p>
<p>四樓聯華化學廠的指導員正在解釋玉蜀黍粉的製造過程，一位聽衆恍然大悟：玉蜀黍是　的經化學方法一製後成爲甜的，所以這一袋是『甜粉』呀？</p>
<p>2.轟擊太乙</p>
<p>五樓可說是最學術性，最有意思的一樓，自從中國航空模型硏究會參加展覽，更爲之增加十聲色不少。他們不煩其詳的爲觀衆解釋，並且實地表演，可是飛機在室內飛行時候，轟！把對面太乙麥精粉廠的鹽酸給摔倒了！</p>
<p>3.地下英雄</p>
<p>地下英雄在過去，一度是很吃香的，雖然最近漸漸地爲飛來的所代替，可是展覽會裹她們却很活躍。在義賣部，在會計部她們不停地計帳，核算每天工作到深夜，有誰知道她們辛苦？</p>

<h3>答客問</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>問：中國技術協會的會址在那裏？</p>
<p>答：在目前，中國技術協會承中國科學社的協助，暫時借他們的會所爲通訊址。所以，如果你有信給我們，請寄：「上海陜西南路五三三號中國科學社轉」</p>
<p>問：加入中國技術協會以後，有什麽權利可以享受？</p>
<p>答：關於這個，我們不能作什麽應允。在過去，技協約會員一直就是盡義務的多，權利享的少。我想你也同意，就一個團體而論，不盡義務，單享權利，也是不大好的。技協希望和他的會員一起創造會的事業，爭取會的權利，這不是全要看自己的努力才能決定權利的多寡麽？</p>
<p>問：中國技術協會的領導人物是誰？</p>
<p>答：我們想要求你認識的，技協之進展到現階段，絕不是某一二個的功勳，那是不可能的。爲了上海工業品展覧會，技協發動了近百個會員負責籌備，在會期裏更獲得了三百個非會員的帮助。二年來技協經常地有四五十個人集中精神在推行會的事務。所以如果你同情技協，愛護技協，請無須關心它的成員，因爲如果你加人，你也可能成爲技協約一個重要分子。</p>
<h3>工作者言</h3>
<p>我是管理這次工業品展覽會五樓上海電力公司所陳列的那一部分，這是經過「技協」的裏面幾位主幹人多方的慫恿，才在臨開幕前的一二天去向電力公司當局交涉，因此這次所陳列的東西，很多有不完善的地方，譬如說明的文字，或者是英文，來不及譯成中文；或者有中文的地方，說明不够充分。</p>
<p>「技協」裏面各位辦事人對於工作的熱誠態度，引起了我對於工作的興趣，在展覽的幾天裏爾，我每天四五個鐘點，站在陳列品的一案，指手吐沫地給詢問的參觀者講解，我毫不覺得一毫疲勞，也可以說是由於他的「技協」辦事人的精誠所感動而來。—陳鴻年</p>
<p>這幾天在「上海工業品展豐會」中我看到了眞眞的「大國民風度」。每天有成萬的人，冒着雨，從各處趕到寗波同鄉會來參觀，他們硏究。討論。摘錄·……在這樣的塲合中，誰都會相信中國的工業化是不難的。—劉文光</p>
<p>這許多人來參觀！不管是刮大風，下大雨，可是，趕不了我們熱心的參觀者，我心裏只是覺得興奮，人愈多，工作愈忙，心裏愈高興，興奮。—趙鍾美</p>
<p>今天你是一隻發育未全的　鷄，願明天已能引頸長鳴！—劉晨鐘</p>
<p>這次上海工業品展覽會，非但是現階段中國工業成果的一次檢閱，而且也是我們中國技術協會團結合作力量的一次檢閱。</p>
<p>如果「技協」沒有這許多熱心的會員，我們便沒有自信來舉辦這一次展覽會，如果在籌備及展覽期間沒有全體會員的通力合作，「工展」就不會得到像今天這樣美好的結果。</p>
<p>這次工業品展覽會，敎訓我們唯有不斷吸收各工業部門各階層的優秀分子來參加「技協」，才能使我們的影響擴大，唯有努力加强聯繫會員間的感情，發揚會友間互助合作的精神，才能保證「技協」事業的成功。—宋名適</p>
<p>在這次展覽會裏，我們更深一層的體騐到：唯有合作·團結，才有力量！這次的表演僅是開端。我們保持這種工作的精神，並且更發揚光大。—林鼎貽</p>
<p>不論義務性的及職員性的工作，我都擔任過好幾種，然而沒有一次較來「工展」服務更有興趣，更有意義。我希望我們的技術協會本以往的精神繼續爲「振興工業」而奮鬥；同時不要忘記我們的使命「將全國的技術人員團結起來！」—闕德芳</p>

        <h1>1946.03.29</h1>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Executive Group Four Departs for Northeast This Morning; Marshall to Return to China Upon Completion of Official Duties</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] As Executive Group Four of the Mediation Executive Department prepares to depart for the Northeast on the 29th, conflicts between the Nationalist and Communist armies have intensified in at least three areas. The situation in Changchun is also increasingly tense, with rumors circulating that Communist troops are infiltrating the city in large numbers, closely following the withdrawal of Soviet troops. According to the latest weather report, Executive Group Four is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 29th, each team including a U.S. Army Colonel. As of this evening, the destinations of the Executive Groups remain shrouded in secrecy, but it is expected that a special announcement will be made by the Mediation Executive Department upon their arrival. News from the Northeast today states that the centers of Nationalist-Communist conflict are located northeast of the Fushun coal mines, the Liaoyang area, and around Sipingjie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that Marshal Marshall is eager to return to China as soon as his official duties here are completed, but the date of his departure has not yet been determined. Acheson did not elaborate on Marshall's official duties, but it is officially acknowledged that Marshall personally urged the National Foreign Loan Committee to double its loans to China. Since arriving in Washington two weeks ago, Marshall has emphasized the need for immediate economic and material assistance to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] General Marshall's representative, Lieutenant General Gillem, has held several discussions with Chairman Chiang on military matters. It is generally expected that General Zhang Zhizhong, due to other work commitments, may be replaced in his role within the military subgroup. Reliable sources state that both Gillem and Zhou Enlai are trying to persuade Zhang Zhizhong to stay on so that he can jointly visit the Northeast according to the planned schedule, but the government generally believes that even though the Northeast issue is more important, Zhang should focus on dealing with the Xinjiang autonomy issue, which he is familiar with.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong is scheduled to depart for Dihua on the 29th to negotiate the final agreement with the Ili representatives. People in the wartime capital expect that Zhang's trip will result in the signing of an agreement granting a high degree of autonomy to the people of Xinjiang and abolishing the so-called "East Turkestan Republic."</p>
<h3>Situation in Changchun Increasingly Severe; Soviet Troops Withdraw Towards Harbin; Communist Troops Seize Several County Seats in Songjiang Province</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] Air Force sources: The 14th Regional Command of our Air Force, originally stationed in Changchun, has withdrawn westward to Jinzhou. Only a small number of ground personnel remain to handle unfinished business. From now on, our aircraft must obtain Soviet consent to land at Changchun Airport.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] Changchun experienced overcast and rainy weather last night. The sound of gunfire was faintly audible, mixed with the heavy sound of artillery. Residents of Hongxi Street in the western district even heard bugle calls. The Hongxi Street Red Cross received a phone call stating, "Tonight the Eighth Route Army will attack the police station, please turn off the lights," the caller identifying himself as being from the "Police Station," and repeated this twice. Subsequently, the hospital inquired with the police station and learned that this was not the case. It is generally believed that this is a form of psychological warfare by the Communist army, accompanied by the discovery of a so-called advance guard incident. Soviet troops continue to withdraw from the area. The original large number of personnel stationed at the Kuanchengzi warehouse of the Telecommunications Bureau have withdrawn, and most of the Soviet liaison officers stationed in various agencies are also leaving. The number of Soviet troops in the city is decreasing, while the number of Communist troops is increasing, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the actions of our military representatives will be dictated by the actions of the Soviet Headquarters. It is generally observed that the Soviet Headquarters here may move to Harbin in the near future, at which time our military delegation will also follow. Furthermore, Liu Handong, Chairman of the Liaobei Provincial Government, Secretary-General Xu (blank space), and Committee Member Zhang Shilun, along with a group of fourteen others, who were captured in Sipingjie, returned to Changchun and issued a written statement detailing their experience.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 28th] Soviet troops from various counties in Songjiang are currently concentrating here in preparation for withdrawal. All the county seats from which Soviet troops have withdrawn have been occupied by Communist troops. Soviet troops from Anda County withdrew completely to Harbin on the 23rd. As soon as the Soviet troops left the county seat, the Communist troops immediately attacked, engaging in battle with the county's self-defense corps for 24 hours, eventually capturing the county seat.</p>
<h3>Central Government to Hold Memorial Service for Martyrs Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The central government has decided to hold a memorial service for the revolutionary martyrs of March 29th at 9:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium. The entire nation will have a holiday on this day, and flags will be raised in commemoration.</p>
<h3>Receiving the Fushun Coal Mine Yields Only Eight Thatched Huts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] Shao Yizhou and other personnel from the Northeastern Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs have advanced with the army and successfully taken over the Fushun Coal Mine. The equipment in the mining area has been completely destroyed. What was received this time was only eight surviving thatched huts. The devastation is heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Restoration of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Feng Section Progresses Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 27th] Emergency repairs on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway north of Yancheng began on the 23rd. In the past four days, the repairs have reached Wangzizhuang Station, covering six kilometers. There are still nine kilometers to be repaired from Wangzizhuang to Yucheng, which are expected to be completed within a week. The project from Yancheng to Yucheng is being repaired by An Wenlan, the Chief of the Jinan Engineering Section, together with the transportation subgroup. All materials are being prepared by the Railway Bureau, requiring 3,000 steel rails and over 30,000 railroad ties. The electrical wires and poles on both sides are also being repaired simultaneously. However, there is a 40-meter iron bridge northwest of Wangzizhuang, which may be more difficult to repair. The original working hours were scheduled from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, but due to special environmental constraints, the working hours are only permitted from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Communist personnel north of Yancheng have dispatched civilian laborers to assist, and the road repair work is progressing smoothly. Furthermore, the repairs south of Tai'an have reached Yunting Station, with a total of 20 kilometers repaired. There are still eight kilometers to be repaired to Dawenkou. On the Jiaoji Railway, repairs east of Zhangdian have reached Xindian Station, with a total of 22 kilometers repaired.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Emergency repairs on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, after reaching Botou, have been suspended. Xu Decao, the Communist representative of the Botou transportation subgroup, is ill. The government and American representatives are requesting the Executive Department to send someone else to continue the work.</p>
<h3>Shandong Military Unit Numbers and Designations Ordered to be Submitted to the Executive Group</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] The military and political authorities and the Communist side in Shandong Province have been ordered to submit the designations, numbers, and stationing information of their respective units to the Executive Group for reference. Colonel Locke will return to Jinan with Communist representative Ren Nong and then go to Zhangdian to resolve all issues on the Jiaoji Line before going to Qingdao and transferring by boat to various coastal areas of the Jiaodong Peninsula for inspection, in order to address all issues based on facts.</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Arrives in Chongqing from Shanghai; Responding to Chairman's Telegram to Discuss Various Issues; 9,000 U.S. Marines from Tianjin to Return Home Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, after arriving in Chongqing from Shanghai today, immediately visited key figures such as President Soong for discussions. It is reported that Wedemeyer was invited to Chongqing by a special telegram from Chairman Chiang, so that he could discuss various matters with Chairman Chiang before departing for the United States on April 2nd. The issues expected to be discussed include the situation in the Northeast, the handling of surplus U.S. military supplies, and the establishment of a U.S. military advisory group. It is rumored that members of the U.S. military advisory group will maintain extraterritorial rights and other privileges. This issue has not yet been resolved. Another issue is that their salaries will be increased by 15 to 20 percent above the base amount.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] General Wedemeyer flew to Chongqing yesterday morning at the invitation of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 28th] The headquarters of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division announced today that 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 officers in North China will be sent home within the next two weeks.

<h3>Shao Lizi Cables UNRRA Director-General; Requesting Additional Food Allocations to China; Political Consultative Council to Review Reception Work Today</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Consultative Council, recently sent a cable to UNRRA Director-General Lehman, requesting additional food allocations to China. The cable read as follows: "The National Political Consultative Council understands the importance of UNRRA's mission and appreciates the assistance provided to China. However, in view of the extreme food shortage in China, the allocations made by UNRRA are relatively small. The Council has therefore passed a resolution requesting additional food allocations. The situation in the recovered provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi is extremely serious, with people lacking food and starvation rampant. In other areas, unless adequate relief is received before the harvest, millions of people will also face famine. The National Political Consultative Council hereby authorizes me to appeal to Your Excellency and the United Nations Food Board to approve the total amount requested by the Executive Headquarters. Greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3>War Criminals Detained in the Capital to be Tried Soon</h3>
<p>Uchida Gin-no-suke Arrested in Tianjin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Reliable sources indicate that war criminals detained in the capital will be tried soon. Kondo Shinpachi, the commander of the 134th Division of the Japanese Army, a lieutenant general, who was recently escorted from Shunde to Guangzhou, will also be sent to the Army Headquarters in the capital to await trial. Okamura Neiji, the former commander of the Japanese Army stationed in the capital, is suffering from a tongue disease, but his general health is still good. According to Okamura's informal statements, he is willing to be tried if he is listed as a war criminal. It is reported that the war criminal trials will be held in the auditorium of the Army Headquarters in the capital, and active preparations are underway. The trials are expected to begin after Commander-in-Chief He returns to the capital.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] Japanese war criminal Uchida Gin-no-suke, who served as the commander of the 118th Division of the Japanese Army, committed rape, robbery, and murder during the occupation of Qingdao, engaging in all kinds of evil deeds.

He has been arrested by the Garrison Command here.</p>
<h3>Officers and Soldiers Who Perished with Dai Li at the Same Time to Receive Posthumous Compensation by Order of the Military Affairs Commission; It is Heard That the Director of the Military Intelligence Bureau Has Appointed a Replacement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Staff of the Military Intelligence Bureau in the capital will hold a memorial service for General Dai Li. General Dai's son and younger sister have arrived in the capital, and several of Dai's relatives are also in the capital. The Military Intelligence Bureau has not yet informed Dai's mother of the tragic news. It is heard that the Military Affairs Commission, based on a report from the Military Intelligence Bureau, has ordered that the officers and soldiers who perished with Dai be given posthumous compensation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Chongqing News: The selection of Dai Li's successor is not as difficult as rumored. It is heard that someone has been appointed as an acting director, but it remains to be confirmed whether it is He Guoguang, the former director of the Military Intelligence Bureau. The organizations under the Military Intelligence Bureau have been repeatedly downsized during the war, and there are now enough personnel to fill any vacancies. The training camp established in Xifeng, Guizhou, has long been closed. It is also heard that General Dai Li had drafted a further downsizing plan to reorganize the bureau into an information division before his death. General Dai dedicated himself to the revolution and pledged his life to the country. A year after the Anti-Japanese War, he made his will. His only significant assets were several hundred feet of reference books. According to Dai's friends, Dai was a modern, essential, and excellent intelligence worker. His characteristic of hating evil like the plague was the true nature of a revolutionary. For more than a decade, Dai constantly fought against evil for the survival of the nation, but he also had a compassionate heart and rescued several promising young people. Several of these young people are now participating in the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and some have been sent overseas to study scientific research related to intelligence work.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address: A Letter to the Nation's Youth: Understand the Reality of the Nation, Transform the Environment, Promote the Revolutionary Spirit, and Fulfill the Mission of National Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] On March 29th, the third Youth Day, Chairman Chiang issued a letter to the nation's youth, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also the first Youth Day after the end of the War of Resistance. In the 50-year process of the National Revolution, the youth were the most courageous in action and the most heroic in sacrifice. During the War of Resistance, the youth bore the heaviest responsibilities and performed the most arduous tasks. Now that the War of Resistance against Japan has come to a final victory and the foundation of the National Revolution has been initially established, coinciding with the auspicious occasion of Youth Day, the most excited in spirit and the most fervent in patriotism are naturally our vast youth. I deeply know that the youth of the whole country are celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance, and at the same time feeling the hardships after the war. In some places, the youth are facing situations where transportation is cut off, there is no way to return home, they lack the means to study, it is difficult to find employment, so that food and clothing are insufficient, and illness goes unreported, which is even more depressing than during the War of Resistance. The country will certainly strive to support and rescue you. I, personally, will do my best to find ways to alleviate your suffering. At the same time, I also hope that our youth will understand the reality of the nation, transform their own environment. As long as the youth of the whole country cherish the fruits of the War of Resistance, recognize the path of national construction, hold firm beliefs, strengthen their bodies and minds, and strive forward, they will surely be able to overcome the inevitable difficulties and the necessary stages after this war, and promote the revival of our nation.</p>
<p>Youth of the whole country, the War of Resistance is over, our country has entered a new era, and our revolution has also reached a new stage. The country makes strong demands on the youth, and the revolution also gives the youth a major mission. This demand is to maintain the independent and equal status of the country. This mission is to build a unified, democratic, prosperous, strong, and happy modern country. If we think that the unequal treaties have been abolished, and the independent and equal status of the country can be obtained, the aggressive power of Japan has collapsed, and the prosperous, strong, and happy situation of the country can be achieved without effort, and therefore we become negligent and slack, or even scattered and chaotic, that would be a huge mistake. This mistake will not only delay the life and career of our youth, but also plunge our nation into an irrecoverable abyss. You must know that the fruits of the revolutionary War of Resistance are hard-won and easily lost. The Father of the Nation said: "After the revolution destroys, it must be followed by revolutionary construction," and also said: "Building a house cannot be done suddenly, and so it is with building a country." Our country has undergone the destruction of a long War of Resistance, and must be followed by revolutionary extraordinary construction, in order to maintain its independent and equal status and stand on its own in the community of international societies. The fruits of victory that we have obtained through risking danger, facing difficulties, shedding blood, and sacrificing ourselves must not be lost through any negligence. The great cause of national construction that we have been pursuing day and night must not be frustrated through any carelessness. And being scattered and chaotic is even more of a dead end to self-destruction. The youth of the whole country must promote the spirit of the revolutionary War of Resistance, understand the needs of the nation, endure hardship and hard work, bear humiliation and heavy burdens, concentrate our strength, take unified steps, cultivate our great revolutionary personalities, promote the inherent spirit of our nation, ensure the independent and equal status of our country, and assume the mission of building a unified, powerful, and Three Principles of the People new China.</p>
<p>Our construction enterprise needs a peaceful environment, and the foundation of peace lies in the unity of the country. Without national unity, there can be no stability, and without national unity, there can be no independence. The Second World War made people all over the world feel the preciousness of peace, and China's long-term War of Resistance made our people all over the country recognize the preciousness of national unity, because unity is a prerequisite for national construction, so we must make the greatest and best efforts to promote its rapid realization. China has fought for the longest time and suffered the deepest war disasters. At this time when the war has ended, it is urgently necessary to recuperate and recuperate, to alleviate the people's suffering and restore national strength. Therefore, since the Japanese surrender, for six months, unity, unification, peace, and construction have become the unanimous demands of the whole country, and the common direction of the government and the people. The youth of the whole country must understand that reason is the starting point of peace, and patience is the foundation of unity, and must work together to fight for peace and unity.</p>
<p>Our revolution takes democratic constitutionalism as its final goal. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we expected that the completion of constitutionalism and the victory of the War of Resistance would be achieved with all our strength in one battle. Now the National Government is expanding its foundation, requesting the participation of people from all aspects, and the National Assembly is about to be convened, and the Five-Power Constitution will be formulated. The youth of the whole country must cultivate the demeanor of democracy, cultivate the spirit of the rule of law, assist the country, serve the society, popularize national common sense, and improve academic standards, so as to establish a model of national politics. Three years ago, I told the youth of the whole country: "This war can also be said to be a cultural war. The success, failure, rise, and fall of nationalism, people's livelihoodism, and socialism in Europe in the past three hundred and fifty years are all in this battle. The rise and fall of China's five thousand years of long-standing culture and its moral spirit are also used as a touchstone in this battle. If this battle is not defeated by the hands of the aggressors, then human culture will be scrubbed clean, and Chinese culture will surely flourish." Now that the world's aggressors have been destroyed, it is the time for Chinese culture to flourish. Our democratic rule of law will have a more solid foundation as a result, and the Three Principles of the People will eventually achieve final success. And the excellent youth of the whole country must be clear about propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, so as to improve the personality and cultural level of our people.</p>
<p>Youth of the whole country, your situation is difficult, but your future is bright, your tasks are arduous, but your achievements are assured. The most brutal enemy of the Chinese nation has been defeated, and the most dangerous juncture of the National Revolution has been overcome. As long as the youth of the whole country cherish the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance, cherish the independent and equal status of the country, love and respect themselves, be self-reliant and self-improving, love the country, love the nation, take responsibility, abide by discipline, and first devote themselves to ensuring peace and unity, develop the habit of democratic rule of law, improve academic and cultural standards, lay the foundation for the long-term stability of the country and the nation, unite and work together, then we will surely be able to build a modern country of the Three Principles of the People, prosperous, strong, and happy, to share the responsibility of world peace and security, and to complete the mission of our National Revolution.</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative Walks Out After Proposal Vetoed by Security Council; Representatives of the Four Powers Hold Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] San Francisco, 28th (Radio): Soviet representative Gromyko has left the meeting after his request for the Security Council to postpone discussion of the Iranian issue was rejected. The Security Council has thus encountered an unprecedented crisis. Today, representatives of China, Britain, the United States, and France held a secret meeting to discuss ways to overcome the difficulties. It is heard that the Soviet representative has made it clear that the Soviet side can resume attending the meeting after the Security Council decides to postpone discussion of the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Special Dispatch] Today, the Soviet proposal to postpone the discussion of the Iranian case until April 10 was rejected by a vote of nine to two in the United Nations Security Council. Soviet representative Gromyko and his three advisors then left the Security Council meeting hall at 5:25 p.m. When some reporters approached to inquire, Gromyko refused to comment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th United Press] In the Security Council, French representative Bonnet, American representative Byrnes, Soviet representative Gromyko, and some legal advisors and military officials from France and the Soviet Union, met this morning at the residence of French representative Bonnet, seeking to reach an agreement so that a report could be made and submitted to the Security Council. The meeting lasted for ninety minutes, and the result was that the United States and the Soviet Union each insisted on their completely opposite positions.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Security Council President Quo Tai-chi stated when the meeting began today: The group meeting has failed, and said sadly, "Therefore, we can only continue the discussion from where the committee appointed yesterday left off."</p>
<p>A Dramatic Rupture</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] The dramatic rupture of Soviet representative Gromyko leading his entourage out of the Security Council meeting hall can be said to have come suddenly. First, Gromyko directly informed the Council that the Soviet Union was unwilling to discuss the matter before April 10. Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran are in progress, and they do not want to interfere, and they firmly stated that at least an understanding has been reached between Moscow and Tehran on the issue of troop withdrawal. US Secretary of State Byrnes stated that the United States had received a formal report from Tehran stating that no agreement had been reached between Iran and the Soviet Union, and that the Security Council should immediately hear Iran's complaint and not delay it any longer. If the Council does not accept this case, the United Nations organization will die young due to its ineffectiveness and incompetence. The United States believes that the immediate acceptance of the Iranian case is extremely important for the future of the United Nations organization. Gromyko is the youngest diplomat among the eleven Council members, while French representative Bonnet is an old diplomat of the League of Nations. When Bonnet announced his support for Egypt's proposal to allow Iran to make an oral statement, Gromyko stood up and declared that he could no longer participate in the meeting and would leave immediately. After saying this, he left the seat with his entourage, walked out in great strides, and climbed into the car outside the door. Gromyko's expressionless attitude has long been known among his colleagues in the diplomatic world.</p>
<p>Iranian Ambassador Describes Soviet Demands</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 28th] When Iranian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Arasteh was invited to make an oral statement in the United Nations Security Council, he stated that there was no secret agreement between Iran and the Soviet Union. He then described the experience of Iranian Prime Minister Sadr al-Din Sadr being ordered to go to Moscow in mid-February to hold talks with the Soviet side, saying that Sadr had requested the Soviet Union to withdraw troops as soon as possible without further delay, but the Soviet Union refused and made the following two suggestions: (1) Soviet troops will continue to be stationed indefinitely in some parts of Iran; (2) The Iranian government recognizes the international autonomy of the Azerbaijan province. If the Iranian government agrees to this, the Soviet Union is willing to take the following steps: (A) The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan uses the title of Governor-General to the Iranian central government; (B) The Azerbaijan government does not set up a Ministry of the Army or a Ministry of Foreign Affairs; (C) 30% of the financial revenue of Azerbaijan is returned to the Iranian central government; (D) All documents exchanged with the central government are in Persian; (E) The Soviet government abandons its demand for oil rights, but suggests forming an Iran-Soviet joint-stock company, with the Soviet Union accounting for 51% of the shares and Iran accounting for 49%. Sadr had no choice but to reject this request.</p>

The argument lasted for a long time, and it was only after being reprimanded by the bailiff that it stopped. Subsequently, former German Foreign Office Undersecretary of State Steengracht entered the witness stand to testify for Ribbentrop. He said that Ribbentrop had been deceived by Hitler and became his tool, blindly obeying foolish orders, Ribbentrop had no executive power, and could not be subjected to violence. The prosecutor asked whether Ribbentrop knew that the German Foreign Office had agreed with Romania to order the extermination of 110,000 Jews. Steengracht only said, "I don't know."</p>

<h3>Inspiring Revolutionary Spirit: A Humble Admonition to the Chinese Nationalist Party</h3>
<p>Today marks the anniversary of the heroic and mournful Huanghuagang Uprising martyrs! On this day thirty-five years ago, the Guangzhou Uprising, as described by the Father of the Nation, was "a final stand gathering elites of revolutionary parties from various provinces against the Manchus. Though the event failed, the heroic spirit of the seventy-two martyrs shook the world, truly creating the momentum for revolution in the country." Mention Huanghuagang, and everyone acknowledges it as the most magnificent and tragic scene in the revolutionary founding history of the Republic of China. The Father of the Nation also said, "The reward for the seventy-two martyrs after their death is not merely a memorial stele. The success of the revolution, China's prosperity and strength, and the happiness enjoyed by the entire nation, that is their great reward." Today, as we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs for the first time after the victory of the War of Resistance, the first thing we should do is ask ourselves: Have we made China prosperous and strong? Have we made all the people happy? If we, the survivors, with a clear conscience, cannot yet answer that we have, then the great reward that the revolutionary martyrs deserve after their sacrifice has not truly been received. This is the shame of the revolutionary party members, and also the shame of the Chinese people! And the reason this shame exists, to put it bluntly, stems from the decline of the revolutionary spirit. Today, if we do not commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, so be it; if we are to commemorate them, we must earnestly begin by inspiring the revolutionary spirit. We wish to take advantage of this precious memorial day to humbly say a few words to the Nationalist Party of China.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nationalist Party has indeed made indelible contributions to the history of transforming China. The history of China in the last hundred years is a history filled with bitterness and shame. Anyone who has briefly read Chapter 2 of "China's Destiny" understands the origin of national humiliation and the origin of the revolution. From the Revive China Society to the Tongmenghui and beyond, members of the Chinese Nationalist Party, united under the revolutionary banner of the Father of the Nation, stood at the forefront of the oppressed people of the entire country, engaging in more than fifty years of arduous and virtuous struggle to build China. They overthrew the Qing Dynasty and created the Republic; they overthrew Yuan Shikai and recreated the Republic; they eliminated the warlords and completed unification, and until the invasion of the brutal Japanese, they led the War of Resistance, fought hard for eight years, and finally achieved a glorious victory, and the unequal treaties that were the crystallization of a century of humiliation were finally wiped out. All of this is the immortal achievement of the revolutionary party members, especially the price of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs. We should feel very glorious and excited when we commemorate the martyrs after the victory, but today everyone seems to feel worried, anxious, and depressed, as if we have not yet seen the light. What is the reason for this? We believe that the root cause lies in the decline of the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary party members!</p>
<p>Only those with a vigorous and full revolutionary spirit have the courage to be fearless. And only with fearlessness can we move forward optimistically and overcome all current difficulties. The revolutionary spirit is none other than wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and consistently upheld with sincerity. The Chinese Nationalist Party was originally a revolutionary political party with the longest history and the largest number of members in modern Chinese history. Although many parties may stand side-by-side in the future, the Nationalist Party will still be the largest party responsible for leading peaceful nation-building. As long as each member of the Nationalist Party strengthens themselves, trusts each other, unites sincerely, and strives forward, then no resistance can prevent the success of the construction of a new China. The Nationalist Party will continue to have a bright future, and China will surely become an independent, self-reliant, strong, and prosperous new China. China and the Chinese Nationalist Party have become inseparable in modern history. We, the common people, hope that China will truly become a democratic new China, and we can only hope that the Nationalist Party members will revive their consistent revolutionary spirit of the past, first making the Nationalist Party a truly democratic and centralized political party, and then leading China onto the great road of true democracy. Only a democratic, united, and innovative Nationalist Party is the most powerful guarantee of a democratic and unified new China.</p>
<p>The revolution advocated by the Chinese Nationalist Party is a national revolution, not a class revolution. Since the national revolution is a revolution of the entire people, the political essence of the Nationalist Party should be to represent the entire people, and its political purpose is to unite the strength of the entire nation to build an independent, unified, and democratic new China. In the process of revolution, the Nationalist Party may have to consider reality, cope with the environment, and may slightly change its nation-building procedures, but in terms of the ideal of revolution, the Nationalist Party must not change its ultimate goal of implementing the Three Principles of the People. In order to realize the ideal of nationalism, the Nationalist Party should be willing to make China live in equality with all the nations of the world, and should never want to see China become a vassal of any foreign race. In order to realize the ideal of democracy, the Nationalist Party should adhere to its position of "separation of powers and functions" and "independence of the five powers" in the five-power constitution, and formulate systems, and the law should not be casually accommodated or fall into stereotypes, using parliamentary politics or class dictatorship to gloss over things with false democracy. In order to realize the ideal of people's livelihood, the Nationalist Party should, based on the principle of labor-capital coordination and social mutual assistance, quickly implement concrete measures to equalize land ownership and control capital, and must not let things drift, be timid, sit idly by and watch prices soar, labor unrest arise, leading to social unrest and the people living in misery, giving the international fifth column the opportunity to conspire to destroy China! Nationalist Party members can strengthen themselves, can trust each other, can adhere to the precious principles of the Three Principles of the People, think about the people everywhere, always plan for the country, do everything that is beneficial to the country and the people, no matter how difficult it is, and do everything that harms the country and the people, no matter where it comes from or who it comes from, must be eliminated with all efforts, then the people of the whole country will follow the Nationalist Party to devote themselves to the construction of the country. Otherwise, if we only sing good tunes and do not do good deeds, and are weak and incompetent ourselves, and only focus on compromise and accommodation, then the revolutionary spirit will be completely exhausted, what hope is there?</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, and think of the difficulty of creating the Republic, we cannot but express our most sincere and deepest expectations for the Nationalist Party. If the Nationalist Party revives its revolutionary spirit, the government will definitely be strong; if the government is strong, the many major problems facing the country, both internal and external, can be solved easily. The National Government will soon expand its organization, and the National Assembly for Constitution-making will also be convened soon. China is now facing the eve of its second nation-building, and we truly need the spirit of the Huanghuagang Uprising martyrs to be popularized among all Nationalist Party members, and from Nationalist Party members to be popularized among the youth across the country. The blood of the martyrs, the flower of the revolution, the result of careful irrigation and extension, all corrupt and evil forces will be swept away by this revolutionary spirit. And the Father of the Nation's saying, "China is prosperous and strong, and the people of the whole country enjoy happiness," the great reward of the martyrs will one day be fully realized!</p>

<p>[United Press, Atlantic City, 27th Dispatch] The Food Committee of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration today passed a resolution urging 48 member states to strictly implement food control and implement rationing when necessary. It also suggested reconvening the UN General Council in Washington soon. Some governments had proposed that universal rationing should be implemented worldwide for scarce goods to increase exports to supply famine-stricken areas.

<h3>A Commoner President: Truman Takes Morning Walks, Top Reporters and Democratic Party Members Miss Him</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Reporters who are accustomed to rising late and specializing in covering news from the White House were quite disoriented today by the President's unscheduled movements. These distinguished reporters arrived at the White House press room at 9 a.m. this morning to conduct their usual interviews and discovered that President Truman had already gone out for a walk alone, accompanied by several secret service agents. What made it even more embarrassing for them was that President Truman had already taken such walks several times without them noticing. It was not until someone phoned the White House this morning to inquire that they discovered the matter. This commoner President of the United States really does not want to be confined within the iron gates of the White House, and has therefore appeared in public places many times on a regular or ad hoc basis, shocking the secret service agents responsible for his safety. It seems that after being in the White House for nearly a year, President Truman has finally realized that his personal actions are being watched by the public.</p>
<p>[US Information Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] President Truman presented Congressional Medals of Honor to two American heroes yesterday.

There are 11 million young people in the United States who have received this kind of training. Twenty-five years ago, Heaven placed the responsibility of leading the world to peace upon our shoulders. To this day, we will never evade this responsibility. We have won the war and are now working to win the peace. We now have well-trained citizens to help us achieve peace."</p>

<h3>Japanese Returning Home from Europe Heavily Searched, Valuable Items Confiscated Worth Millions of Dollars</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 27th Dispatch] More than 300 diplomatic representatives and their families stationed in various European countries returned home yesterday aboard the Japanese ship "Okishimaru." Diamonds, watches, cameras, and other valuables carried by these people, worth millions of dollars, have been confiscated by the US authorities. It was found that at the beginning of Japan's surrender, the Japanese government ordered its representatives in various European countries to transfer the Japanese government funds they held to the Allied authorities as compensation, but a large number of Japanese diplomats appropriated these funds for their own use and did not pay them out. This time, when they withdrew and returned home, they brought the funds they had seized with them. According to Major Duff, director of the US Eighth Army Dispersal Management Office, "I suspect that there are 5 million US dollars of Japanese government funds on the Okishimaru alone." All disembarking passengers were searched. Three large diamonds were found in a woman's sewing box, and a large amount of cash was found sewn into people's clothes. KURIHARA, the former ambassador to Turkey, had 6,000 US dollars found on him. After the search was completed, all passengers were handed over to representatives of the Japanese government for disposal. The US authorities returned 1,000 yen to each passenger, which is the prescribed amount to carry. The first passengers to disembark were former Minister to Switzerland KAWASE, who submitted Japan's surrender document to the United Nations, and the ambassador to the Holy See, HARADA.</p>

They requested a thorough investigation. It was recently heard that the Yiwu District Court had secretly investigated and found that Luo Zhengxin, the head of the township, had indeed instigated his nephew, Luo Youwei (who was the captain of the self-defense squad), and twelve members of the team to capture 38 refugees passing through the territory. After gathering at Shixi Temple to search for property, they were taken to Changshan Village in Jinyan Township that night, strangled with ropes, and buried. The next day, Chen Mugui and others, who lived in Yeyuan, killed four refugees passing through the territory and abandoned their bodies in the Qianrenta. The court examiners exhumed 38 skulls in Changshan. Most of the necks and bodies were attached with rope. The skull lines had separated, obviously strangled to death.

<p>The Venue Was Simply and Solemnly Decorated</p>
<p>Thirty-seven councilors attended yesterday's meeting, nine were absent with leave, and four were absent without leave, including Chen Taoyi, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Wenyuan, Zhao Zhiyou, Yan Huiyu, Jiang Menglin, Fei Mu, Chen Tingrui, Du Yong, Xian Bingcheng, Wu Rencang, Zhang Guogan, and Li Denghui, etc. The entrance to the venue was crowded with vehicles. A red silk banner reading "First Meeting of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council" was hung above the entrance, and armed patrol officers and police maintained order. Inside the entrance, signing-in areas for councilors and guests were set up on both sides. The venue was located on the second floor, and congratulatory couplets from various sectors were hung on the walls. The venue was simply and solemnly decorated, with red, white, and blue cloth strips hung diagonally. Wall lamps illuminated the surroundings. In front of the podium, potted plants and fresh flowers were arranged. The national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen were hung in the center, and slogans were posted around. In the middle of the venue, four rows of tables and chairs were set up for the councilors, with pens, inkstones, and stationery on each table. Guest seats and press seats were on both sides. Dozens of bureau chiefs and leaders from various sectors attended as guests. Former councilor Pan Gongzhan also attended as a guest. At 9:30 AM, the opening ceremony officially began. After the national anthem was played, Mayor Qian took the chairman's seat. All attendees bowed three times to the national flag and Sun Yat-sen's portrait. The chairman respectfully read Sun Yat-sen's will. Then, Speaker Xu led the councilors to stand and raise their right hands to take the oath of office. Mayor Qian represented the central government in supervising the oath.</p>
<p>The Mayor Expresses Joy at Being Criticized</p>
<p>After the oath, Mayor Qian delivered a speech: "Today, the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council is established. I would like to express my warm and sincere welcome to everyone. What I want to express to everyone is that I dare to emulate Zilu's magnanimity in 'rejoicing when criticized' and Yu the Great's virtue of 'embracing good when hearing it.' I will wholeheartedly accept everyone's criticism and sincerely welcome everyone's suggestions. I hope you will provide more guidance and frankly criticize so that I can correct my shortcomings and the municipal government can make progress day by day."</p>
<p>Speaker Xu's Words Establish a Foundation</p>
<p>Speaker Xu Jilü delivered a speech: "If we want to meet the goals of post-war construction and align with our ideal city, we must gather countless human and financial resources and make long-term plans for ten or twenty years. At present, we are only laying a preliminary foundation. Therefore, we feel that all of us here today are engineers assisting the municipal government in laying the foundation. Although the term is short, the relationship is significant. I rely on you, who have either participated in central government or are local dignitaries, to thoroughly understand this mission in order to live up to the central government's principle of knowing people and assigning them appropriately."</p>
<p>Chairman Wu's Words Blend Together</p>
<p>Chairman Wu of the Municipal Party Committee then delivered a speech, saying: "The people's representative institutions are the main task of the Kuomintang in implementing political democracy. In the short term, we must also hold elections for various representative institutions. This provisional council in the transition period has been expanded from the original 25 members to 50, which is a significant expansion and progress compared to the pre-war provisional council. However, regrets are still unavoidable. In the upcoming elections, the number of seats will be further expanded, and more civic leaders will emerge to participate. After the war, the people are eager for governance. The government needs a large amount of economic support during the recovery period. Only when the government and the people blend together can we overcome these difficulties."</p>
<p>Inspector Cheng's Words Predict Success</p>
<p>Inspector Cheng Cangbo also delivered a speech: "Today, your council is established. Your council can truly share responsibility with me, and I also feel that I have gained a lot of courage. From now on, I will follow the councilors, work together, speak for the people, and do things for the people. I wish the council success."</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker Xi Expresses Hopes</p>
<p>Finally, Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu delivered a speech, saying: "If Shanghai's economy and finance are stable, then the whole of China will also have a solution. Shanghai's development and important position in the world is also the glory of the whole country. In this short period of time, we must all do our best to lay a solid foundation for Shanghai's security. This is not just my personal wish, but also the intention of all the attendees. Our abilities are limited. I hope that local people will provide guidance from time to time."</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting was held at 3:00 PM, chaired by Speaker Xu Jilü.

<p>Councilors Expressed Opinions</p>
<p>The councilors then freely expressed their opinions, advocating for the establishment of an agenda first and inquiring whether questions could be raised regarding municipal reports. Wang Genzhong proposed that council meetings should not follow the old-fashioned style, but should truly cooperate with the public. It would be better for the bureaus to report in writing to avoid wasting time, and he also advocated dividing into fourteen groups to go to various public places on Sundays to gather public opinion and advise the government. The chairman said that all bureaus should use written reports to minimize oral reports. The councilors had various suggestions for collecting public opinion, with some advocating for the establishment of suggestion boxes by district, and others agreeing to sending by registered mail. In the end, Councilor Feng Youzhen said that both methods could be used, and that news about this matter should be disclosed in the newspapers so that citizens could use whichever procedure they chose. The deputy speaker reported that the reports of each bureau during the meeting were limited to one hour, and councilors could ask questions during the remaining time. More seats for observers would be added as much as possible in the future, and each councilor could be issued two observer passes. The meeting schedule would be slightly changed by the secretary-general. Councilor Feng Youzhen suggested that meetings should start on time in the future. If the meeting did not start on time at 8:00 AM, it would be better to move it back one hour. After a vote, it was decided to start at 9:00 AM. The Secretary-General read four telegrams from the Municipal Councilors: (1) To Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen and Vice President Weng Wenhao; (2) To the Councils of all Provinces and Cities in the Country; (3) Paying Respects to Chairman Chiang; (4) To the Elders of this City.</p>
<p>Paying Respects to the Chairman in a Telegram</p>
<p>The full text of the telegram paying respects to the Chairman is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing National Government: With the sea corner newly pacified and the founding of the nation beginning, the people eagerly desire governance and seek to live and work in peace. We admire your Excellency's ability to turn the tide and overcome great difficulties. With compassion in your heart and benevolence covering all, your achievements since the beginning of the people are most remarkable. We, the members of this council, have been ordered to participate in deliberations, and we will all consider the difficulties of the times, concentrate our thoughts, carefully consider the hardships, and investigate public sentiment, in order to live up to your Excellency's power to protect the great achievements and assist the world in lasting peace. We respectfully send this telegram to express our sincerity and pay our respects. Xu Jiguang, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Deputy Speaker, and all Councilors."</p>
<p>Opinions on the Problem of Commodity Prices</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the problems of commodity prices, labor, and factory resumption in this city, which are closely related to the citizens of the city, the councilors have put forward opinions, requesting the government to abolish the special commissioner's office, and also proposed that the Japanese Military Administration Office, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, and the special representatives of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should make public reports to the Municipal Council. Although the principle was passed, the procedure for deciding whether the report should be written or oral and whether it was based on legal principles caused the councilors to argue for about an hour. The Deputy Speaker used the four words "deeply felt pain" to express the spirit of the councilors speaking out for the people. In the end, it was tentatively decided to telegram the Executive Yuan first and ask the central agencies to inform the special commissioners to issue reports. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Provisional Municipal Councilor Zhao Zhiyou Passed Away Due to Illness</h3>

<p>The French and Chinese Electricity Company, the Chinese Pudong Electric Company, and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, except for the part of the French and Chinese Electricity Company's power generation, are all supplied by the Shanghai Electricity Company. The total power generation of the Shanghai Electricity Company is 123,000 kilowatts, and the safe power supply is only 103,000 kilowatts. Recently, factories in the city have resumed operations one after another, and the demand for electricity has reached 118,000 kilowatts. The company feels that the load is too heavy and cannot supply it. Therefore, it put forward three suggestions to the Public Utilities Bureau: (1) Quickly negotiate emergency load reduction measures; (2) Use nighttime to supply electricity to factories to reduce the daytime electricity load; (3) Directly transmit electricity to Pudong and Nanshi to reduce the loss through the Zhabei line. Yesterday afternoon at 10:00 AM, the Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives of the four companies in the conference room of the bureau to discuss electricity supply relief measures. Ma Jingli (American), Nai Duode (French), Jin Hanzhai (Chinese), Deng Shuping (Pudong), Hou Jiaxu (Zhabei), and Chen Zuojun and Shen Bao, the director and deputy director of the Second Division of the Public Utilities Bureau, etc. were present. It was decided in principle that each company should find ways to generate its own electricity, and it was hoped that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company would implement it first. It was also reported that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has an original generator that can generate 30,000 kilowatts of electricity. It is currently actively repairing it, and it will be able to generate electricity soon. The government has also ordered a 24,000-kilowatt diesel engine from the United States, which will be allocated to the city's electricity company for use as soon as it arrives.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Schedules Sailings for Northern and Southern Routes</h3>

The Haixiang ship will travel on the Northern Shanghai-Qingdao route. It is currently under repair and will also travel once every twelve days.

<h3>Jazz Cafe Captures Extortion Suspect: A Public Official Demands Gold</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Wu Shaoqing, a native of Hubei, resides at No. 99, Lane 1281, Xikang Road. After the victory, he extensively purchased concealed enemy materials. Upon being reported to the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau, an investigation confirmed the allegations, leading to the complete confiscation of the items. On the 20th of this month, Xu Zengxun, claiming to be a staff member of the Military Affairs Commission, approached Wu, stating that he could arrange for the unsealing of the materials in exchange for a reward of twenty gold bars. Wu responded that he would not only have the materials confiscated but would also arrest Xu on charges of treason. After Wu's wife, Tian, pleaded, they agreed to meet at the Da Zhonghua Cafe on Xizang Road at 2 PM that afternoon. At the meeting, Xu was accompanied by Li Gongzhi and He Guangzhong. After repeated requests from Wu's wife, the amount was reduced to five gold bars, to be delivered at the Hongmian Restaurant at 2 PM the following day. At the appointed time, Wu's wife only delivered one gold bar and 300,000 Legal Tender, stating that the remaining amount would be delivered after she found a way to obtain it. Xu, considering this insincere, returned the original item and declared that Wu would inevitably be arrested. Helpless, Wu agreed to deliver the full amount on the 28th. Upon returning home, he reported the matter to the 4th Patrol Team of the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Brigade. The team, upon receiving the report, instructed Wu to prepare a fake gold bar and go to the meeting as scheduled, pretending to comply and delivering the item in person. Yesterday at 2 PM, Wu's wife went to the designated location, the Jazz Cafe on Xizang Road. At this time, Yan Jinwen, the Captain of the 4th Patrol Team, personally led team leader Zhang Xinquan, Zhu Zirong, Jiang Jie, and thirty soldiers, disguised and lying in wait. They saw He Guangzhong first contact Wu's wife, asking if she had brought the item. She presented the fake gold bar and 138,000 Legal Tender, asking him to accept it first and that the rest would follow. He Guangzhong, suspecting nothing, immediately put it into his pocket. At this point, Captain Yan stepped forward and apprehended him, recovering the stolen goods, and instructed his men to take him back to the team headquarters for detention. Meanwhile, they continued to wait. Soon after, Li Gongzhi and the mastermind, Xu Zengxun, arrived. Wu's wife identified them without error, and they were all arrested. Along with the complainant, Wu Tian, they were taken for interrogation, and the facts were confirmed. It was decided that they would be handed over to the Garrison Headquarters today for further legal action.</p>

Yesterday at around 9 PM, the 5th Patrol Team of the Headquarters sent officers to the premises, arresting all the dancers. The patrons scattered like birds and beasts. It is reported that those arrested will be handed over to the Headquarters for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Central Printing Plant: Labor Strike at an Impasse, Management Sets Deadline for Workers to Return Today</h3>
<p>All workers at the First, Third, and Fourth Printing Plants of the Shanghai branch of the Central Printing Plant have been on strike since the 25th, with no resolution. A reporter visited the person in charge of the plant, who stated that the strike was sudden, with no prior indication of worker dissatisfaction and no formal demands for negotiation. On the day the strike began, some workers continued to work but were stopped by other workers, causing the work stoppage. The management has repeatedly urged the workers to return to work, stating that any demands could be discussed. The Social Affairs Bureau, upon hearing the news, also sent personnel to investigate the plants for mediation. However, the workers have neither appointed representatives nor made concrete demands, resulting in a stalemate. The management has already reported the situation to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, awaiting resolution. It is reported that the workers submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on the 27th, stating the reasons for the strike and making five demands, including improved treatment and wage adjustments based on the cost of living index. It is also reported that the management, citing that state-owned enterprises are not allowed to strike, set a deadline for the workers to return to work yesterday. Those who do not return will be considered to have resigned voluntarily.</p>
<p>Four Banks and One Bureau</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] A rumor has circulated that the compensation for Four Banks and One Bureau employees has been resolved, yesterday, our reporters especially went to relevant parties and confirmed that this is not true. According to a person in charge of the Four Joint Branches, the branch had requested instructions from the general office regarding adjustments to the compensation of the Four Banks and One Bureau employees. However, because the matter is significant, it is awaiting a final decision from the Executive Yuan, so they have not yet received any instructions regarding the adjustment. When asked to various banks, it was learned that, in addition to salaries and benefits being the same as civil servants, staff members receive an additional 100,000 yuan per month as a loan, and laborers receive an additional 60,000 yuan per month as a loan. These are generally temporary measures. The final decision is pending instructions from the Four Joint Branches.</p>

<h3>Entrusted Sales of Enemy and Puppet Materials: Deadline for Clearing Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions previously entrusted various agencies and organizations to sell and discount enemy and puppet properties. To accelerate the processing and free up a large number of warehouses, a deadline has been set. If the entrusted agencies and organizations delay in retrieving the sealed materials, the processing bureau will auction them off warehouse by warehouse. In particular, materials that are bulky and perishable, such as miscellaneous rough straw bales, should be processed quickly so that the UNRRA and the US military can have sufficient storage warehouses. The processing bureau believes that two-thirds to one-half of the sealed warehouses can be concentrated and emptied before the end of April. In addition, the review committee yesterday approved the return of the Yongming Electric Light Company of Jiaxing and the Waterworks of Wuhu to the local governments for a discounted price. The committee also approved the return of the Da Tong, Da Yuan, Da Heng, Da Li, Da Zhen, Xin Shun, Fu Jiang Su, Bao Ding, Lian Fa, Hua Fu, Xin Tai Feng, and Dong Hai ships to their original owners after they publish notices and provide guarantees.</p>

Police officer No. 5423, who was passing by, immediately opened it and found it to be a woman's breast, still bloody. It was impossible to tell whether the person was Chinese or foreign. The police officer immediately took it back to the police station in charge and ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Struck by Lightning</h3>
<p>Died on Bridge in Heavy Rain</p>
<p>Jiang Qinsheng, a 29-year-old carpenter from Jiangjiatang, No. 4 Bridge, Cao Bao Road, West Shanghai, and his cousin Jiang Botao, were carpenters' assistants at the Lu Jiawan Public Works Bureau. They were accustomed to leaving early and returning late. Around 6 PM on the evening of the 27th, the two finished work and went home. At that time, there was thunder and lightning, and the rain was pouring down. Unexpectedly, when they reached Bridge No. 2 on Cao Yan Road (about two miles from their home), there was a crash of thunder, and the two fell to the ground. After about fifteen minutes, Jiang Botao gradually woke up, but Jiang Qinsheng lay face up on the bridge, head to the west and feet to the east, with his clothes open, pants down to his knees, and his chest, abdomen, and face all purple-black. The rice pot and bottle of soy sauce he had bought were still beside him. Later, Botao asked someone to carry the body home, and he was buried yesterday.</p>

<h3>400,000 Yuan Lost at Tram Station: Yan Xixian Returns Money Found, Hoping the Owner Claims It Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>Our reader, Mr. Xi Xian, came to our office yesterday morning and stated: "I recently came to Shanghai from Haimen. At around 7 PM on the 27th, while passing by the tram station near the Lin Sen East Road Taishan Branch, there was heavy rain. I noticed a cloth package left beside the station. I opened it and found 400,000 yuan inside. I shouted loudly to find the owner, but no one claimed it for a long time. Thinking that the owner must be very anxious about losing such a large sum of money, I have specially sent it to your newspaper for public notice. The claim period is ten days. If no one claims it after that period, it should be used for charitable purposes to bring blessings to the owner." (Editor's Note) This money is currently being held temporarily by this column. We hope the owner will come to our office with a guarantor to claim it. We express our sincere admiration for Mr. Yan's honesty and warm-heartedness.</p>

<h3>Dumping Three Million in Unified Bonds, Only to Run Away: See the Fate of Speculators!</h3>
<p>After government bonds hit a new high the day before yesterday, a major player dumped three million unified Class C bonds. Due to squeezing and resentment, he ran away, dragging down multiple operators. Yesterday, the market stopped trading and convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. As a result, there were no large transactions, only some black market trades in the corridors. Generally, miscellaneous brands slightly declined, and Class C bonds still rose slightly, but with less reliability. Yesterday, Chinese stocks were extremely erratic because banks are closed today and it's Saturday tomorrow. To avoid risks, operators ended part of this week's transactions yesterday, and will resume next week. As a result, many parties were eager to sell, and signs of exhaustion occurred frequently in the middle of the day. However, they were pulled up again at noon. By the afternoon close, familiar large stocks had fallen slightly, while small stocks rose another half a percent. Lesser-known stocks, due to their low prices, attracted many buyers and rose again, especially small ones, which rose by about 20%. Due to the market closure in the afternoon, futures trading was not opened. Foreign stocks were similar to Chinese stocks, with small stocks slightly better and large stocks slightly lower except for Wheelock Marden.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Fall, Market Will Likely Become Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, raw gold remained flat and weak, with narrow fluctuations and few transactions. The market was extremely sluggish. It opened flat in the morning, and after opening, supply exceeded demand, resulting in a slight decline. The Bank of China's allocation price did not change, so there was no reason for dealers to register. Later, a low price of 1.52 million was seen, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it was around 1.53 million. The afternoon was even quieter. As a result, it closed 15,000 lower than the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 168,000, refined silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were being sold at 1,150 yuan. Due to speculators closing out their positions, the underground lending market was very loose, and interest rates fell to 15-18%.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Falls, US Dollar Stable</h3>
<p>Foreign currency, US dollars, remained stable and were not affected by the fall in the gold market. This is because the US Senate is maintaining the original price of silver, so raising the price of gold is unlikely. In addition, some cotton settlements have not been approved, so importers still rely on US dollars. Gold remained at 780 yuan per ten taels, with a trend towards further increases, reaching a high of around 1,970 yuan and a low of no more than 1,960 yuan. The market was very stable at noon and in the afternoon, slightly lower by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars initially fell below 420 yuan, but were then slightly pulled up by telegraphic transfers. As a result, it still fell by 5 yuan. New Hong Kong dollars were flat and weak. (One) series dollars for 1936 closed unchanged from the previous close. However, (Two) series dollars and 1937 dollars fell by 10 yuan due to low demand, widening the price difference. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 440 yuan, and rupees were 540 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Brokers Apply for Adjustment of Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The sixteen foreign exchange brokers have felt that the commission rate set by the Central Bank has been too low since they began operating. The Central Bank has stated that this commission rate will be tried for one month, and then adjustments can be applied for as appropriate. As the one-month period is about to expire, the foreign exchange brokers are preparing to apply for adjustments. It is reported that the new commission rate has been approved by the designated banks after consultation and will be submitted to the Central Bank for approval.</p>
<p>Also, according to the responsible authorities of the Bank of China, all foreign exchange settlement matters across the country can now be handled in Shanghai. Therefore, there is no need for individual opening of foreign exchange markets in various places at present. Once settlement is numerous and there is a business necessity, they will consider further liberalization.</p>
<h3>Jianye Textile Prices Reduced, Yarn and Cotton Transactions Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market stabilized. Guangdong dealers still have an appetite for high-grade 20-count yarn, with Shuang Ma brand standing firm between 1.13 million and 1.14 million. Guangming brand 16-count yarn also rose slightly by 10,000 yuan or so. Fine yarn was still ordinary. At noon, Jianye Textile Company issued its usual prices. 42-count Qing brand yarn was again listed at just under 70,000, while 40-count Maiden brand was priced at 1.88 million, actually 360,000 lower than the market price on the 25th. Other counts of yarn were all priced down by several tens of thousands. Dealers, seeing that the company was selling at a discount again and again, seemed unwilling to bid. It is said that Jianye will be closed today for the weekend and will sell cotton cloth and woolen products on Saturday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York cotton prices fluctuated, with near-term prices firm and far-term prices weak, up or down 11-16 points. Recent-term cotton was priced at US$27.13, and far-term cotton at US$27.02. Spot Mitrelin cotton had no market. Local spot cotton transactions remained sluggish. Only the privately-owned Zhongxin No. 5 Factory purchased 400 bales of fine velvet cotton raw materials, priced at 94,000 yuan per bale by Zhongji, and 86,000 yuan per bale by Mitrelin, both factory-delivered prices. In addition, Jianye Textile Company, private yarn mills, and cotton brokers are all taking a wait-and-see approach and have taken no action. (The yarn and cloth markets will be closed as usual on the 29th for the Huanghuagang Memorial Day.) Most will wait until after the market reopens before making purchases.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Gradually Shows Signs of Life</h3>
<p>Standard cloth is showing a trend towards activity as dealers from Sichuan, Changsha, Hankou, and other places are roughly ready to purchase. As the weather improves, the prospects should improve.</p>
<p>Dyeing and weaving factories are frequently dyeing printed yarn and plain yarn, and have prepared a considerable stock. Once the weather warms up, they will launch a large-scale offensive.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Waterproof Cloth in Stock</h3>
<p>In the woolen fabric market, transactions in Zhongfang 500 brand Serge were still active, but the rest showed no improvement. However, there was strong sales of waterproof cloth for raincoats. Western-style clothing dealers and raincoat factories were all actively purchasing, but unfortunately, the market supply was very scarce and difficult to find. Prices have risen another 300-500 yuan per yard compared to before.</p>
<h3>Java's Tea and Sugar: Tea Production Has Decreased, Sugar Reserves About 1.4 Million Tons</h3>
<p>[Reuter, Batavia, 28th] It is estimated that 22% of the 2.6 million acres of tea plantations in Java were taken over by the Japanese in 1942 and uprooted. In mid-1945, the area of tea plantations not destroyed totaled 134,000 acres. Total Javanese tea production in 1944 was 3.4 million kilograms, a decrease of 900,000 kilograms compared to 1943. Of the 220 tea factories existing in 1941, 50 continued to operate, while the rest were destroyed or converted to making textiles and explosives. On the east coast of Sumatra, the total area of tea plantations was 54,000 acres, of which 15,000 acres were uprooted and 3,000 acres had their small branches cut off. Sumatran tea production in 1944 was estimated at 6 million kilograms, only 10% of 1941 production.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 28th] According to investigations, Java currently has 1.4 million tons of sugar reserves, and there may be more inland. They have not yet been shipped out in large quantities, but this amount is obviously not much compared to the global sugar shortage. According to estimates at the beginning of this year, sugar production for 1945-46 was approximately 24.6 million tons, while pre-war consumption was 30 million tons. The global sugar stock is currently unknown, but it must be significantly different from the pre-war figures. Authorities believe that the full restoration of free trade in sugar will take some time.</p>
<h3>Silk Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction price for 80% average grade silk was 2.45 million yuan for five bales. Asking prices for ordinary factory silk were short, with dry warp slightly better selling, with prices similar to the previous day. No. 120 Tianqiao brand rayon opened at 1.58 million yuan and closed at 1.61 million yuan, with very little price fluctuation compared to the previous day. No. 75 bright rayon traded at 2.5 million yuan. The silk market was uniformly weak, with American Asian quilt covers at 1.06 million yuan per 100 pieces, down 80,000-90,000 yuan from the previous day, and transactions were still scarce. The price of Dacheng check crepe was reduced by another 30 yuan per yard, and goods from Shengze were also weak.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Gradually Decrease, Oil and Soybean Cakes Are Generally Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market is experiencing sluggish sales and entering a weak phase. Both japonica rice and glutinous rice have seen price drops of 500 to 600 yuan. White rice is moving slowly, with prices down 1,000 yuan. Indica rice is flooding the market, but there are few buyers, causing a price drop of 1,000 yuan. Both supply and demand for flour are low. The Ningbo traders are active, but sales are not strong, and prices are temporarily stable. Bran is not selling well, with prices down 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake sales are stagnant. Changzhou and Wuxi oil factories continue to sell, but buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a further price decrease of 300 to 400 yuan. There are few small-scale transactions of yellow soybeans on the local market, and few inquiries from other regions. Prices have fallen by 600 to 700 yuan. High-quality soybeans are holding steady. The oil market continues to receive supplies from various sources. There is still optimism about the scarcity of raw oil. Soybean oil remains firm. If the weather clears, there is hope that rice prices will continue to decrease.</p>
<h3>Explosions in Northern Anhui, Goods Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Longda freighter, operated by the Dada Datong joint venture, returned to Shanghai yesterday from Hankou. It transported over 2,280 bags of rapeseed and 1,010 bags of soybeans from Yanhu, as well as 380 bags of wheat. It is docked at the Dada wharf in Nanshi for unloading.</p>
<h3>Soft Competition in the White Coal Market, Slight Increase in the Bituminous Coal Market</h3>
<p>The white coal market is weak. The price of screened lump coal is fluctuating at a soft level, with further slight declines. It is rumored that coal briquette manufacturers will receive a preferential allocation of coal dust. Transactions are quiet, and market prices are soft. The supply and demand of bituminous coal screened lump are balanced, and market prices rarely change. Bituminous coal traders do not have abundant inventory. However, since factories have been allocated coal, sales have significantly decreased, and market prices have sharply declined. Prices are now close to allocation prices, and traders are reluctant to sell at such low prices. Therefore, with slight purchases, prices rise again, and the market is fluctuating. In the end, various goods see a slight increase. Due to the rainy weather, charcoal is arriving wet and unsalable. Traders are unwilling to purchase it, resulting in sluggish sales and weak market prices. River and stream charcoal is selling for 17,000 yuan per load, and pine firewood is selling for 4,300 yuan per load.</p>
<h3>Imported Electrical Materials Are Dumped, Domestic Products Are Difficult to Maintain</h3>
<p>With full-scale reconstruction, the domestic demand for common industrial materials is increasing. However, the larger electrical equipment manufacturers in Shanghai are still struggling. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai factory of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory of the Resources Committee, the factory took over six enemy and puppet electrical factories in Shanghai. They were all small in scale and have already started production. The manufactured products include copper wire, rubber wire, decorative wire, transformers, motors, electric copper, and copper sheets. Except for copper and yarn, which can be purchased locally, many imported raw materials are also required. Combined with high labor costs, the selling price of the manufactured products only covers the cost. Recently, British merchants in Shanghai have been dumping various pre-ordered electrical materials and equipment, with selling prices 60% to 75% lower than current market prices in Shanghai. If the pre-ordered goods arrive in port in the future, the market will be flooded with goods, and market prices will be significantly affected. At that time, Shanghai's electrical factories will be unable to compete. Therefore, factories such as Huacheng, Huasheng, and Huatong have not yet started production, and only Huade Factory is manufacturing light bulbs.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Today (the 29th) is Memorial Day for revolutionary martyrs. Banks, money shops, and markets in the city are closed for the day. A summary of yesterday's market conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>Tea: Wenzhou Pre-Ming Dragon Well tea may be available by the end of the month. Traders have no interest in old stock, resulting in a sharp decline in transactions and further price declines.</p>
<p>Sugar: The sugar market tightened slightly yesterday. Medium-grade sugar sold for 48,750 yuan to 49,000 yuan at the Public Association, and North Market sold for 51,000 yuan, while snow-white sugar sold for 53,500 yuan to 54,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>To Reduce People's Losses, Uniform Bonds Should Be Appropriately Handled</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhi</p>
<p>Since the black market for Uniform Bonds moved to the Overseas Chinese Building after the destruction of its old nest in Zheng Huo Lou, it has become increasingly prosperous. Despite Minister Yu's written statement, it has continued to reach new highs in recent days. Various problems with settlements have been reported in this newspaper. Over the years, there have been frequent reports of account defaults and settlement problems. General customers have repeatedly suffered losses and have no legal protection. After reaching a new high price the other day, a major player sold more than 3 million yuan of Class C bonds and did not fulfill the settlement procedures. The relevant firms waited until late at night without being able to resolve the issue. We strongly agree with enhancing the credibility of national bonds. However, on the other hand, the status of legal tender should be taken into account (the face value of Uniform Bonds is denominated in national currency, but the legal tender issued before the war also stated that it was payable in national currency upon presentation). Regarding Uniform Bonds, mixed bonds are falling by half. Bonds without coupons for the 31st year, bonds with slight stains, or bonds below 1,000 yuan that do not form a whole of 10,000 are not accepted. The speculation and manipulation of Uniform Bonds are obvious. Since Minister Yu has made a statement, we hope that the authorities will quickly take appropriate measures because those currently engaged in government bond speculation are mostly speculators and idle funds. The higher the ball is kicked, the greater the damage suffered by the final holders. Since the government cannot prevent bond market activities, it is obliged to reduce unexpected losses for the people.</p>

<h3>Hubei Education Department Stipulates: Student Meal Fees Should Be Collected Monthly</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou] In order to make it easier for students to raise funds for meals, the Hubei Provincial Education Department has recently stipulated that all provincial, municipal, county, and private secondary schools should collect student meal fees on a monthly basis for this semester and may not order payment in one lump sum.

<h3>Guangxi University Still Moves to Guilin</h3>
<p>Classes Will Resume Next Month</p>
<p>Recruit Some Students to Go to Wuzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] According to the Central News Agency: Guangxi University previously experienced student unrest due to the school relocation issue. The Ministry of Education sent Inspector Tong Da-xun to Liuzhou last month to handle the matter. After investigation, it was found that the temporary school site borrowed from the Women and Children's Work-Study School of the 16th Army Corps in the Liujiang Zhugujiang River was indeed insufficient. Chairman Huang Xu-chu agreed to allocate all the houses of the Guilin Central Wireless Equipment Factory and all the remaining houses of the Liangfeng original school as the permanent school site for the university. The school authorities have been ordered to start repairs and preparations for relocation, with the aim of resuming classes in mid-April. Efforts are also being made to recruit some students who went to Wuzhou to report to Guilin in time.</p>
<h3>Private Schools in This City Petition, Requesting Subsidies from the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[This City News] Jiang Jizhou and other directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation went to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday morning to meet with Deputy Director Li Ximou and stated the economic difficulties of private schools, saying: The tuition fees of private schools are collected in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Education Bureau, referring to the treatment of teachers and staff in municipal schools, with a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan for primary school teachers and 40,000 yuan for secondary school teachers as the standard. Recently, prices in the city have soared. When the Education Bureau stipulated the amount of tuition fees in January, the cost of living index was 520 times that of the 25th year, and when the school started charging fees this semester, the cost of living index had risen to more than 1,800 times, and now it has exceeded 2,000 times. The salaries of teachers and staff in private schools are less than half of those of ordinary workers. They are not well-fed or warm. They requested the municipal government to subsidize private schools and allow them to continue collecting the second tuition fee. Deputy Director Li expressed great concern for the difficult situation of private schools and expressed his opinion that the municipal government has approved 54 million yuan for the government's subsidy to private schools, and the bureau intends to request additional allocations. As for private schools collecting the second tuition fee, it is also under consideration to alleviate the current difficulties of private schools.</p>
<h3>Qingdao City Starts Work on Adding Desks and Chairs</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Yuan From the Branch of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] During the enemy and puppet occupation of Qingdao, half of the desks and chairs used in primary and secondary schools in Qingdao were damaged, totaling more than 20,000 sets. After the victory, students from various counties in eastern Shandong fled to Qingdao, and the population gathered in Qingdao. Schools temporarily adopted a two-shift system, dividing students into morning and afternoon classes, taking in as many students as possible, or even four people sharing a desk, and some even standing in the classroom to listen to lectures. At the request of the Education Bureau, the Shandong Qingdao Branch of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to investigate and subsidized the Education Bureau with 20 million yuan to start work on adding desks and chairs within a limited time through work relief methods.</p>
<h3>Symposium on Living Problems</h3>
<p>Hosted by the Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association held a symposium on living problems for colleagues from various private schools at 7:00 p.m. on the 27th at Minli Middle School. Despite the heavy rain, more than 100 representatives from various schools still arrived and spoke enthusiastically. They did not disperse until 11:00 p.m. The following conclusions were obtained at that time: (1) The treatment of each school is an average of 450 yuan per hour for junior high school and 550 yuan per hour for senior high school, earning 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month. (2) According to the current minimum standard of living, at least 200,000 yuan per month is sufficient to support a family of several people. (3) The solution is that, in addition to the fact that some schools' finances are not public, the bureau should be ordered to make them public, and the bureau should provide universal relief. Because the fees collected by each school are limited and cannot be improved, and education is a national undertaking, the purpose and spirit of colleagues' service are not divided between public and private, and the authorities should not discriminate. It was also decided that the association would first unite with various colleagues' organizations in the education sector to request the bureau. If they do not get the point, they will carry out a general petition.</p>

The former had two new players, Wen Tuoer and Shi Laituo, who were not registered, but they were still on the field and their momentum was strong. However, at the beginning of the game, Liangxi also posed a threat. After 8 to 6, Jiangwan was at ease and advanced steadily. Liangxi had no choice. The first half was 37 to 23, and Liangxi resisted once in the second half. Zhang Shaoqing and Zhuo Guorong worked hard again, but the strength difference was still far away. Only the American soldiers were active. In the end, Jiangwan won 77 to 44.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Discussions at the Political Consultative Conference and the Current Situation in Various Regions: Councilors Offer Candid Remarks</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Zhao Hongsheng, Our Correspondent (Dated the 24th by Airmail)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Political Consultative Conference, a tense atmosphere had long been brewing within the Council. Councilors, coming from all parts of the country, measured the various aspects of the Political Consultative Conference against the realities of their localities, and it was no wonder that they were filled with grief and indignation. Ms. Wu Yifang presided over the assembly, and perhaps only her talent and strength could control the emotions of the crowd so that they would not descend into chaos.</p>
<p>Determined to Implement Resolutions</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi held a newspaper carrying the full text of the Political Consultative Conference's closing ceremony and resolutions as his "battle report." He constantly quoted Chairman Chiang's words to illustrate the importance of the various issues discussed at the Political Consultative Conference. His glasses flashed as he adjusted them, and his tone grew increasingly elevated. Finally, he said that he would like to state on behalf of the government that the government was absolutely determined to earnestly implement all the resolutions. All rumors spread by various parties from outside were not credible.</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Xingzuo gave a report related to the Political Consultative Conference on the cessation of military conflict, the restoration of transportation, the streamlining of the military, and the plan for unifying the Communist forces. A large stack of inquiries began to be read out. The first person to read them had excellent vocal expression, and was able to convey the emotions expressed in the words very vividly.</p>
<p>Zhang Legu recounted that after the cessation of conflict, the 15th Regiment of the 5th Brigade of the Communist forces outside Qingdao City advanced more than one hundred li and entered Qingdao City on February 26. He asked whether the resolutions of the Consultative Conference could be truly implemented. Sa Mengwu inquired whether, in addition to the various parties, there were also non-partisan representatives participating in the conference. Now that there were more than 400 million people in the country who were non-partisan, he asked which segment of the non-partisan population these representatives represented. The entire hall erupted in laughter.</p>
<p>"Pocket Squad" Activities</p>
<p>Zhang Liangxiu questioned the increase in the number of National Assembly representatives, while the People's Political Council, representing the will of the people, had vanished without a trace. He felt that it was too disadvantageous not to have a party affiliation. Wang Guoyuan asked on what legal basis the conference was established. How could a small number of ambitious politicians from a single party or faction represent the people of the entire country? He argued that the addition of new National Assembly representatives should be based on fair elections, allocating seats according to the strength of the parties, which was truly absurd. He thoroughly opposed all of this, advocating for the cancellation of all these illegal decisions. Councilor Zhang Zhiguang said that since the "successful" conclusion of the conference, it had not brought peace and stability. The Communist Party was taking the opportunity to run wild, implementing many strange and bizarre policies in the "Liberated Areas," such as the "Alarm Squads" that went around grabbing food, the "Eavesdropping Squads" that specialized in espionage, and the "Pocket Squads" that plundered the people's food. If a couple had a quarrel, they would encourage them to divorce, causing all kinds of disturbances, which were even worse than the enemy puppets in the past.</p>
<p>Weeping and Paying Respects</p>
<p>Ma Yifeng stated that after listening to the report, standing from the position of the people and his conscience, he could not help but say a few words. He inquired whether transportation had been restored since the Consultative Conference closed, whether the Communist Party had opened the areas they had locked down, and whether the military, government, and political affairs had been unified… He stated affirmatively: absolutely not! In fact, things were getting worse and worse! He said that all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were merely a blank sheet of paper, a "heavenly book" written in black ink. Finally, in the name of the people, he paid "weeping and respectful homage" to all these resolutions! Tan Pingyou wrote with his trembling hand whether all these resolutions would be jointly observed.</p>
<p>This is Negotiating without Cooperation</p>
<p>Zhang Shouyue said that since the Political Consultative Conference, disputes had been increasing. "You tolerate, but I do not tolerate; you concede, but I do not concede." He asked how many copies of major national newspapers could be sold in the "Liberated Areas." Was there freedom of the press there? Could the various parties operate there? A certain councilor proposed that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference be subjected to a general public judgment based on national conscience! Was such a conference becoming a shortcut for ordinary people to organize political parties and seek official positions? If in the future two or three people formed a political party and demanded official positions from the government, how would the government cope? What was the standard for so-called "social elites," and how many "elites" were there in society? Zhao Gonglu also asked what criteria were used to judge "elites," and whether the people were at ease with them. He also mentioned that within nine days of the close of the Consultative Conference, the Communist Party had captured nineteen counties. Where was the "success" that Mr. Shao Lizi had just spoken of? Wu Yunchu asked, with the various parties occupying ninety percent of the new National Assembly seats, where were the people placed? Tan Pingshan said that this was "negotiating without cooperation." He Baozhen said that this was truly "strange and bizarre" democracy, and that the number of National Assembly representatives from the Democratic League was even greater than the number of people they could represent! Chen Jidian asked whether the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference had to be approved by the highest authority of the various parties, and whether they also had to be approved by a body representing the will of the people? He also mentioned when the Communist forces in the Northeast would be downsized. Li Yu said that drafting and implementing a constitution was the proper function of the National Assembly, and that the Consultative Conference was engaged in constitution-making work. What legal basis did it have? Li Jianzhi said that the so-called nationalization of the military was actually the fragmentation of the military and the nation.</p>
<p>There Are Too Few Elites</p>
<p>Liao Xuefeng wrote: only seventy seats in the National Assembly representatives were allocated to social elites. In Confucius's time, among his three thousand disciples, there were seventy-two worthy ones. Now, China's population is hundreds of millions, and the descendants of the seventy-two worthy ones have multiplied repeatedly, so their number must be considerable. Yet, the National Assembly representatives only have seventy-two social elites, which is two fewer than the worthy ones in Confucius's time, which is far too few. Another councilor asked whether the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference had seen today's news from the New China Daily. Was the Consultative Conference able to allow the people of the whole country to live and work in peace? There were indeed problems.</p>
<p>Passing a Special Review Committee</p>
<p>Most of the thirty-four written inquiries were from councilors from various regions, and the unified voice was one of dissatisfaction. After the inquiries were read out, the chairman stood up to report that Yin Shuxian and over sixty others had proposed a temporary motion requesting the assembly to organize a special review committee to review the issues of the Political Consultative Conference. Of the 158 councilors present that day, the motion passed with 148 votes.</p>
<p>The first oral inquiry was from Kong Lingcan. He recounted that the Communist Party was forcing people to move in various regions to sever their social ties. During the war of resistance, people "had a home but could not return." Now, they "had no home to call their own." They were also forcing men and women to pair up indiscriminately in various regions, disrupting the entire social order. Everyone should pay attention to all of this. Wang Puhan said that in the Consultative Conference, only parties were seen, not the people. The method of producing National Assembly representatives was unclear. Although he himself was an old National Assembly representative, he was also dissatisfied with the great concessions made by the old representatives to preserve their seats. Wu Chunwu said that in the Consultative Conference, he only heard about competing for National Assembly seats, National Government Committee seats, and so on… very little was mentioned about transportation, reconstruction, prices, and other things that would truly solve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>The Uproar Returns to Quiet</p>
<p>Tao Xiangchuan stated in his speech that the convening of the Political Consultative Conference was the only way to solve the special political problems after victory, and should be considered a success. His words caused a great disturbance, so much so that he was drowned out by a cacophony of sounds before he could finish speaking. The chairman stood up to maintain order, and Ma Chongfeng shouted: "The chairman himself is breaking the law. Why is your watch sometimes fast and sometimes slow?" The chairman calmly replied, "Extending the session by one hour is following yesterday's precedent. Please, everyone, observe the order of the meeting." The uproar finally subsided. It was already eleven o'clock, but there were still many people who wanted to speak. What to do? The result was another one-hour extension, following the precedent.</p>
<p>Wang Lizai asked what was meant by "Liberated Areas." Su Qun said: America is an old democratic country. MacArthur is a Republican. Why does the Consultative Conference deprive soldiers of the right to join a party? There were even more people speaking out on the issue of the draft constitution.</p>
<p>The Five-Minute Request</p>
<p>Finally, Shao Lizi requested five minutes to reply. Someone suggested that it was too late and asked him to speak at the review committee. He said: Now that the journalists are here, it would be good to let everyone hear it. His reply was divided into six points: (1) The convening of the Political Consultative Conference was based on the resolution of the first session of the People's Political Council regarding the National Assembly, convened by the chairman and approved by the Standing Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council. (2) Among the representatives, excluding the government side, only six out of thirty were not councilors. (3) The current difficulties are truly heartbreaking, but everyone must overcome them. (4) Local governments are only temporary. Of course, they will be improved in the future. (5) The matter of passing the draft constitution in the National Assembly is a way for the various parties to restrain their own members. (6) The fact that this National Assembly is drafting a constitution but not implementing one was a decree promulgated by the National Government in the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937].</p>
<p>The heated debate ended there. The chairman stood up as if relieved of a heavy burden and announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>The Great Artery of National Reconstruction: The Northwest Highway</h3>
<p>— Dispatch by Airmail from Lanzhou by Chen Qian, Our Correspondent (Dated the 17th)</p>
<p>Now that we are in a period of active reconstruction, people in the country seem to have a tendency to forget about the Northwest. In fact, everyone knows the importance of the Northwest. There is no need for reporters to repeat stale phrases, but if one does not fully understand the entire Northwest, one cannot have a deep understanding. However, being here, I will talk about what I have heard and seen for the time being. This article is specifically written about the Northwest Highway, and it will inevitably be rambling. Of course, it will not be as accurate as "official statistics," so this article can also be said to be a humble attempt to elicit expert opinion. I hope that those who know more and write better will point out my mistakes. The transportation routes of the Northwest Highway, because the bureau is located in Lanzhou, of course include roads open to traffic in Gansu and Qinghai. In addition, it connects Xinjiang to the west, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei to the east, Sichuan to the south, and Suiyuan and Ningxia to the north. Cars can now travel to all of these provinces. To go a step further, the newly constructed Southern Xinjiang Highway and Qinghai-Tibet Highway are also included. Once they are successfully opened to traffic, international routes can also be opened in these two places.</p>
<p>The Highway Management Organization</p>
<p>Has a Confusing History</p>
<p>The Northwest Highway Management Organization was first established in April of the twenty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] as the Preparatory Office of the Northwest Highway Administration Bureau. At that time, the area under its jurisdiction was only the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. It was subordinate to the National Economic Council. Later, it was changed to the Northwest National Highway Administration Bureau. In addition to Xi'an-Lanzhou, its jurisdiction also included the Feng-Han-Ning Line. At that time, the director of the bureau was Mr. Zhao Zukang, the current director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The bureau was located in Xi'an. After the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], it was moved to Lanzhou to specialize in international military transportation. At the same time, it expanded its jurisdiction, adding the Gansu-Qinghai Line. Subsequently, it was renamed the Northwest Highway Transportation Office and the Shaanxi-Gansu Transportation Administration Bureau. The above-mentioned offices and bureaus were all directly subordinate to the National Economic Council or the Northwest Commissioner's Office of the Council. It was not until January of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938] that it was changed to be subordinate to the Ministry of Communications and renamed the Northwest Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. At this time, the lines under its jurisdiction were the Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Lanzhou-Qinghai, Gansu-Qinghai, Hua-Shuang, Feng-Han-Ning, and Han-Bai lines, with a total length of over three thousand kilometers. The development of business and the busy traffic were the golden age of the road. Later, in the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], it was changed to be subordinate to the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. In the thirty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], it was again subordinate to the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. In the spring of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], the group was changed to the Northwest Highway Administration Bureau of the Wartime Transportation Administration Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. In addition to continuing to handle the original transportation business, it also handled the supervision of engineering and post transportation. In the spring of this year, it was once again placed under the jurisdiction of the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. In summary, the various bureaus and offices were changed eleven or twelve times in ten years. Every year, they were handling transfer procedures, not only exhausting the administrative personnel, but also constantly preparing inventories and preparing for the arrival of new directors. Because Chinese affairs are often "a new emperor, a new court," lower-level staff members are also endlessly bothered by welcoming the new and sending off the old. Such complicated changes are truly a strange thing. The lines currently under the jurisdiction of the road are the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road from Lanzhou to Hami, the Gansu-Qinghai Road from Lanzhou to Xining, the Lanzhou-Xi'an Road from Lanzhou to Xi'an, the Hua-Shuang Road from Huajialing to Shuangshipu, the Ningxia-Suiyuan Road from Pingliang to Shanba, the Han-Bai Road from Hanzhong to Baihe, the Bao-Guang Road from Shiji to Guangyuan (formerly the Feng-Han-Xian), the Ping-Shi Road from Pingliang to Shiji, and the Lanzhou-Lintao Road from Lanzhou to Lintao (this line has now been expanded to the Lanzhou-Minxian Road). The mileage from Lanzhou to various places is approximately as follows: to Xi'an is 719 kilometers, to Guangyuan is 943 kilometers, to Hami is 1390 kilometers, to Dunhuang is 1161 kilometers, to Ningxia is 879 kilometers, to Shanba is 246 kilometers, to Xining is 236 kilometers, to Baihe is 1284 kilometers, to Chongqing is 1565 kilometers, to Dihua is 1102 kilometers, and to Laohekou is 1521 kilometers. It is now also said that there are plans to operate on the Southern Xinjiang Highway. This time, in order to facilitate the completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, there are many cars transporting military and government goods to Tianshui. If the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is repaired to here in the future, it is feared that transportation west of Lanzhou will become even tighter.</p>
<p>Visiting the Outskirts of the Road Bureau</p>
<p>Takes Three Days</p>
<p>The bureau is located to the left of the busiest Lanzhou Highway, with poplar trees planted along the roadside. To the northwest is an international road. The bureau is built on the site of the City God's palace. Surrounding it are the affiliated Lanzhou Hospital, Lanzhou Sub-Station, Lanzhou Machine Factory Supply Cooperative, Service Center, Nursery, Barber Shop, New Dormitory, Sibei New Village, as well as the Ministry of Communications' Rotary Elementary School, Northwest Highway Special Party Headquarters, Northwest Highway Trade Union, and Northwest Building, occupying a large area. If you want to visit the outskirts of the Road Bureau, it will take you three days. Inside? Under the director and deputy director, work is divided into groups. Currently, there are groups for transportation, engineering, mechanical affairs, materials, accounting, general affairs, and auditing, as well as a post transportation office, which specializes in managing the use of mules, horses, camels, and rubber-wheeled carts for animal-powered transportation. The bureau is built against the mountains. "Sidunping" on the mountain is a well-known military building, extremely majestic and solemn. Colleagues often hold mountain climbing competitions in their spare time to exercise. Now that spring has arrived, the employees' children also climb to the top to fly kites, competing in their creativity and skill, which is very lively.</p>
<p>When we were engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the Japanese devils, the position of the Northwest Highway became increasingly important. We are not "discussing merits and awarding prizes" now. Just speaking of the spirit of dedication of the road's employees is already highly admirable. Whether in Guannei [within the pass, i.e., central China] or Guanwai [outside the pass, i.e., Manchuria], in the boundless sand sea, in remote villages, or in icy and snowy lands, there are their traces. Why? Because they are all "transportation warriors" who have endured hardship and difficulty, truly serving the country. I remember that Mr. Song Xishang once described the major events encountered by the bureau during the war of resistance, which can be recorded in six items: (1) international transportation, (2) Sichuan-Shaanxi military transportation, (3) military transportation for various theaters of war, (4) evacuating materials and refugees, (5) moving the spirits of fallen soldiers, and (6) expanding route planning. Following Mr. Song, Mr. He Jingwu was the director. During Mr. He's tenure, I would like to supplement the following points: (1) transporting immigrants to Xinjiang, (2) Tianshui-Chengdu transportation, (3) repairing old cars and organizing old departments, (4) expanding Hua-Ying military affairs, (5) building the Northwest Building and Northwest New Village, and (6) implementing military management of employees.</p>
<p>Like an Old Ox Pulling a Broken Cart</p>
<p>The Directors Work Hard</p>
<p>Mr. He's tenure was also a prosperous and vibrant period for the bureau. When Mr. He was about to leave, it coincided with the reorganization of the Longhai Railway. Originally, people working on the railway said they were doing "mechanical" work and had a "iron rice bowl." Who looked up to the highway? Moreover, people working on the railway often said that pulling a train was enough for your cars to transport for a year. However, Mr. He especially valued the five directors of the Longhai Railway. These five also worked hard like old oxen pulling broken carts. The five directors of the Longhai Railway were: Huang Zhaotong, director of the Transportation Department; Sun Jiding, director of the Mechanical Affairs Department; Huang Rixin, director of the Accounting Department; Yan, director of the Engineering Department; and Yu Shixia, director of the General Affairs Team. These five old men have served in the transportation industry for thirty or forty years and are all white-haired old men around sixty years old. They are all old friends of Ling Hongxun, the current vice minister of the Ministry of Communications. They were all invited to Lanzhou one after another and had a spirit of hard work. During the war of resistance, of course, every employee did their best to work hard day and night to complete this great transportation mission. I hope that the Northwest Highway will make more contributions during national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Although the road is located on the border, the places where the vehicles go are all places that were developed and opened up the earliest by the Qin and Han dynasties. If we travel the entire road and see the scenic spots, the feelings of admiring the ancients will arise spontaneously and will surely make us happy and excited.</p>
<p>This place is not only beautiful, but also a major artery of national defense. If you don't believe it, please come and visit.</p>
<p>Don't Forget the Northwest</p>
<p>We Cannot Shirk Our Responsibility</p>
<p>During the national struggle around the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], the Southwest was also threatened, so the slogan "Develop the Northwest" was particularly loud. Every day, one could hear the roar of airplanes in the sky, going up and down. Small cars in the city were also speeding by like the wind, carrying people who were "leaving the Jialing River in the morning and staying on the banks of the Yellow River at night," either on inspections or looking for a place to escape. Now, it is silent and still. Has the Northwest been forgotten? Moreover, many civil servants, in order to "return home," have resigned and "returned to their fields." Has "developing the Northwest" really been completed? I still want to tell you: although you have not seen the thousands of minerals hidden underground in the Northwest waiting to be developed, you can see the XX oil mines, XX coal mines, Longxi medicinal materials, and grassland cattle and sheep, which are all resources for national reconstruction. There is also the golden roof of the Ta'er Monastery in Xining, which is said to be worth twice the amount of the Boxer Indemnity, and the Dunhuang national treasures that were stolen by foreigners… Think: who should bear the responsibility of "developing the Northwest"? Who should bear the responsibility of preserving the legacy of our ancestors?</p>

<h3>The Soldiers' Voices Amidst the Call for Military Reorganization and National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: As our unit is about to be transferred to the Northeast, I have a few points I would like to present to the relevant authorities and the people of the nation through a corner of your esteemed newspaper.</p>
<p>Because we are soldiers, we cannot speak for ourselves. No matter how difficult or dangerous the situation, we can only grit our teeth and endure. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance, we suffered hardships unknown to ordinary people, experienced the most horrific scenes in the world, spent the whole year in desolate battlefields, unable to eat when hungry, unable to clothe ourselves when cold, even as our normal life (only eating two bowls of coarse rice per meal and drinking a few mouthfuls of salted vegetable soup). As a result, we were physically weak and lacked strength, yet we still had to travel tirelessly, everywhere meeting the enemy's frantic attacks, constantly fighting for the country. Bleeding, year after year, as if it were a daily occurrence because this was the mission given to us by the era, which we could not shirk.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation, it has already been seven months since the victory. Under the principle of military reorganization, many units have already begun to adjust. In the past few days, in many places, weren't there many groups of three or five tattered, discarded soldiers wandering around? They fought for the country for eight years. Now they are old and disabled, useless. Each person is given 1,000 yuan in legal tender and told to seek other employment. The other day, I passed by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station on business and saw a disabled soldier in a gray military uniform sitting on one side, his face haggard, begging along the road. According to him, he was wounded in the Battle of Wuhan. Although the wound has healed, he does not know where his original unit has gone due to repeated battles. He is disabled and cannot work, but who sympathizes with him? Who will say a word from the heart: "He sacrificed himself for the country, for his compatriots." What he receives is no different from the cold eyes of ordinary beggars. At that time, I was filled with mixed emotions. A soldier wounded in the War of Resistance ends up in such a state!</p>
<p>In today's world of expensive goods, prices are soaring daily. The government is unable to curb rising prices and does not raise salaries. May I ask, how can a private or a second-class soldier survive on a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan (only enough to buy a few packs of cigarettes, not even enough for a haircut, a bath, or any pocket money)? The daily food allowance for officers and soldiers is 100 yuan, including (oil, salt, vegetables). In the past, regardless of whether the month was long or short, it was paid according to 30 days. It was said to be easier for accounting. This year is different. Long months are still paid for 30 days, but February only has 28 days, so the extra two days are deducted. I don't know who invented this unreasonable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the current situation: We won't even talk about the places where the central government's orders are not implemented. Even in the Shanghai-Nanjing area near the capital, who is actually concerned about the families of soldiers on active duty or providing assistance? Wandering in the streets and alleys, aren't they the pitiful, helpless orphans and widowed mothers who have lost their fathers? In the past, when we were trapped on the battlefield, we could not see their pain or inquire about them. Now, in this post-victory world where all the people are rejoicing, some who made fortunes during the national crisis spend thousands of gold coins lavishly, enjoying delicacies of all kinds. Even ordinary laborers can eat their fill and keep warm, but our families, who risked their lives for the country, are struggling on the brink of starvation every day, and no one cares. Thinking of this, I am filled with emotion. Although "if the territory is not recovered, the responsibility lies with the soldiers," still, "the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen." We were not born with the words "soldier" engraved on our foreheads. We are all soldiers who grew up during the War of Resistance, soldiers who volunteered out of patriotic fervor. In short, the survival of the Northeast is the survival of China. The morale of the national army, the elite quality, can affect the smooth reception of the Northeast. This is an undeniable fact. Recently, the increase in desertions from units transferred to the Northeast is not because the soldiers are afraid of death or hardship. If they were afraid of death, they would not have followed the troops to fight in various places, and they would not have defeated the Japanese warlords, who had the second-strongest army in the world. Therefore, I deeply hope that the authorities, the most urgent thing is to provide assistance to the families of soldiers, at the very least, not to let them be displaced, so as to reassure the soldiers. The suffering of the soldiers themselves is not worth mentioning, precisely because our soldiers all come from poor families.</p>
<p>Finally, we know that the current era is an era of survival of the fittest. Whoever can run ahead of the times is an advanced person. Conservative, fraudulent, selfish, and profiteering behavior can affect the future of the country. We should point out our own shortcomings without hesitation because we are also members of the country! (Qi Yi)</p>

<h3>Written Before the Closing of the Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>The formation of a group or the achievement of a cause is mostly the combination of talents from various fields; and the power generated by this combination often exceeds the sum of each individual talent. The achievements of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition are promoted under this consistent belief. For eight years, China's national industry, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, has not made significant progress; the occupied areas certainly need not be mentioned, and the rear has also been subject to various restrictions. By the time the War of Resistance was won, a desolate scene was presented before us. It was at this time that the China Technical Association held the first "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition" in Shanghai, a place that can represent Chinese industry, hoping to "call for rapid national industrialization from here."</p>
<p>Today, the exhibition is approaching its closing. In the past five days, more than 40,000 visitors have participated in the exhibition, which is indeed beyond initial expectations. Because like many people, now is not the time for an industrial exhibition, but what is causing today's hustle and bustle and prosperity?</p>
<p>We believe that it is only because it originates from the people that it can be so lively and prosperous. After the baptism of the War of Resistance, the people have stood up. They want to find a truly great way to strengthen the country and enrich the people, so national industrialization has become a consistent slogan and a consistent goal. Therefore, an exhibition that promotes industrial products is already attractive enough, even though China is so lacking in industry, and even though Shanghai is so depressed, everyone who cares about the future of the motherland wants to explore the prospects of the new China from here.</p>
<p>But behind the "hustle and bustle" and "prosperity," we see:</p>
<p>The manufacturers participating in the exhibition, because they are in a state of extreme economic instability, all feel unable to continue production. Even the Daming Speedy Printing Machine, whose technical improvements have been very successful, although attracting a large audience at the venue, cannot be produced in large quantities because the production cost exceeds the market price. Therefore, before the closing of this industrial products exhibition, we deeply feel that technical improvement is indeed an essential element in promoting industrial construction, but if the minimum guarantee is not given to this group of warriors in the industrial sector, it is impossible to continue to improve.</p>
<p>Through this exhibition, the colleagues of this association have the opportunity to directly contact industrialists, admire their spirit of hard struggle. This group of people who are loyal to the country and interested in industry are not easy to cultivate. Don't discourage them, don't let them down!</p>
<h3>Our Inspiration and Apology</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyi</p>
<p>Whether they are members of the Technical Association or not, no one is not excited about the grand occasion of this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. We colleagues responsible for the preparatory work are particularly excited, so excited that we have forgotten all the fatigue and bitterness of the past four months. Isn't that right? After the victory of the War of Resistance, we had a moment of excitement, but after testing, this excitement proved to be empty. From emptiness to dimness, we have not yet escaped these dim days. But today, for everyone who is willing to tightly embrace himself and the motherland, the exhibition undoubtedly reveals a glimmer of hope to him. Remember, this is seven months after the victory, the first constructive, positive, and optimistic symbol. From here, we see the vitality of the great new China.</p>
<p>Don't think that this little achievement is meager. This is the blood and sweat forging of the Shanghai industrial community under the suppression of puppets and traitors and the turbulence of prices. As long as the gentlemen who are familiar with Shanghai's industry before the war can admit that Shanghai's industry, especially in the technical aspect, has only progressed and not declined after these eight years. There are many machines and products that are unprecedented. Therefore, a very obvious revelation is that the development of Chinese industry is not concerned about the technical aspect. The intelligence of the Chinese people is fundamentally not inferior to anyone!</p>
<p>Please also pay attention to the audience of this exhibition. In addition to young intellectuals, there are haggard old people, as well as energetic children, soldier comrades, civil servants, professional and family women. They have all come to the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. There is no magic here, no entertainment. What is displayed here are all real objects. What is explained is not theoretical examples, but actual experience. Why is it so sensational? A very simple reason is that they also want industrialization. Science and engineering have shortened the world's space. The Chinese people can easily hear the breath and pulse of other countries. Seeing them living healthily and happily in a modernized environment, the restoration is largely completed, and new construction plans are gradually starting, but we are slow to move. Who doesn't want to improve their lives? Who doesn't want the country to be stronger? Industrialization is already the people's demand. No one can put stumbling blocks in front of the work of national construction anymore. Wake up, especially those great gentlemen whose responsibilities seem even more important.</p>
<p>Therefore, seeing the situation of this industrial products exhibition, we have no reason not to be inspired. We are deeply fortunate that a small motive has aroused the sympathy and resonance of a wide range of people from all walks of life. It seems that every visiting gentleman is tolerating the shortcomings of this exhibition and the current industry without saying anything. The exhibition and Shanghai's industry are not without shortcomings. On the contrary, there are many, but the atmosphere of tolerating each other for the sake of the country seems to be very common. Everyone knows that China's industry can only be cultivated and not destroyed, only rewarded and not suppressed.</p>
<p>However, because of this, we also have endless apologies. The preparation time and work are certainly not sufficient, so many manufacturers could not participate, and the exhibition site and period both seemed small, causing us to have many shortcomings in reception. We didn't even have time to set aside a day or two specifically to entertain students from various schools. Here we respectfully record our deep apologies and guilt. What can be told to our compatriots is that the purpose of this industrial exhibition has been partially achieved. We feel a kind of ardent atmosphere in the venue every day and believe that this atmosphere will spread out and reach every corner of the country. In this atmosphere, the cultivation of vitality is easier. Moreover, because of the inspiration of this exhibition, we have already prepared to conduct the Industrial Exhibition of the 36th Year of the Republic of China. In that exhibition, we believe that the scale will be even larger, the period and venue will be more spacious, the educational and construction significance will be more profound, and there will be more places to be proud of. We have this belief, and we can also determine its success.</p>
<p>Now, this exhibition has come to an end. May we start from here, and we will work hard separately. Let's take a year as a period. At that time, we will have a pleasant and healthy meeting again.</p>
<h3>At the Venue</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>1. Is starch sweet?</p>
<p>The instructor of the Lianhua Chemical Factory on the fourth floor is explaining the manufacturing process of corn flour. One listener suddenly realized: Corn is made into sweet after being chemically processed, so this bag is "sweet powder"?</p>
<p>2. Bombing Taiyi</p>
<p>The fifth floor can be said to be the most academic and interesting floor. Since the China Aviation Model Research Association participated in the exhibition, it has added a lot of color and sound. They explained to the audience without bothering about the details and performed on-site. However, when the plane was flying indoors, boom! The hydrochloric acid of the Taiyi Malt Essence Factory on the opposite side was knocked down!</p>
<p>3. Underground Heroes</p>
<p>Underground heroes were very popular in the past, although they have recently been gradually replaced by flying ones, but they are very active at the exhibition. In the charity sale department and in the accounting department, they kept accounting and calculating every day until late at night. Who knows their hard work?</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Q: Where is the address of the China Technical Association?</p>
<p>A: Currently, the China Technical Association is temporarily borrowing the address of the China Science Society as a communication address with the assistance of the China Science Society. Therefore, if you have a letter for us, please send it to: "China Science Society Forwarding, No. 533 South Shaanxi Road, Shanghai"</p>
<p>Q: After joining the China Technical Association, what rights can you enjoy?</p>
<p>A: Regarding this, we cannot make any promises. In the past, members of the Technical Association have always fulfilled more obligations and enjoyed fewer rights. I think you also agree that for a group, it is not very good to only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. The Technical Association hopes to create the cause of the association together with its members and strive for the rights of the association. Doesn't this all depend on your own efforts to determine the amount of rights?</p>
<p>Q: Who are the leaders of the China Technical Association?</p>
<p>A: We want to ask you to realize that the progress of the Technical Association to the current stage is by no means the merit of one or two people, that is impossible. For the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, the Technical Association mobilized nearly a hundred members to be responsible for the preparations, and during the exhibition period, it received the help of more than three hundred non-members. For two years, the Technical Association has regularly had forty or fifty people focusing their minds on promoting the affairs of the association. So if you sympathize with the Technical Association and love the Technical Association, please do not worry about its members, because if you join, you may also become an important member of the Technical Association.</p>
<h3>Workers' Words</h3>
<p>I am in charge of managing the part of the Shanghai Power Company displayed on the fifth floor of this industrial products exhibition. This was after several key people inside the "Technical Association" repeatedly encouraged me to negotiate with the authorities of the power company one or two days before the opening. Therefore, there are many imperfections in the things displayed this time. For example, the explanatory text, or English, was not translated into Chinese in time; or in places where there is Chinese, the explanation is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic attitude of the people in charge of the "Technical Association" aroused my interest in work. During the days of the exhibition, I spent four or five hours every day standing at a case of exhibits, gesticulating and explaining to the inquiring visitors. I didn't feel tired at all. It can also be said that it was inspired by the sincerity of the "Technical Association" staff. — Chen Hongnian</p>
<p>These days, I have seen the true "national demeanor" at the "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition." Every day, tens of thousands of people brave the rain and rush from all over to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to visit. They study, discuss, excerpt... In such occasions, everyone will believe that China's industrialization is not difficult. — Liu Wenguang</p>
<p>So many people come to visit! Regardless of whether there is a strong wind or heavy rain, we can't stop our enthusiastic visitors. I just feel excited in my heart. The more people there are, the busier the work is, the happier and more excited I feel. — Zhao Zhongmei</p>
<p>Today you are a chick that is not fully developed, I hope that tomorrow you will be able to stretch your neck and crow! — Liu Chenzhong</p>
<p>This Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition is not only a review of the current stage of China's industrial achievements, but also a review of the strength of unity and cooperation of our China Technical Association.</p>
<p>If the "Technical Association" did not have so many enthusiastic members, we would not have the confidence to hold this exhibition. If there was no concerted cooperation among all members during the preparation and exhibition, the "Industrial Exhibition" would not have achieved such a good result as it has today.</p>
<p>This industrial products exhibition teaches us that only by continuously absorbing outstanding members from all industrial sectors and all levels to participate in the "Technical Association" can we expand our influence. Only by striving to strengthen the relationship between members and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among members can we guarantee the success of the "Technical Association's" cause. — Song Mingshi</p>
<p>In this exhibition, we deeply realized that only cooperation and unity can bring strength! This performance is just the beginning. We maintain this working spirit and carry it forward. — Lin Dingyi</p>
<p>Whether it is voluntary or staff work, I have held several positions, but none is more interesting or meaningful than serving at the "Industrial Exhibition." I hope that our Technical Association will continue to strive for "revitalizing industry" with the spirit of the past; at the same time, do not forget our mission "to unite technical personnel from all over the country!" — Que Defang</p>
<p>2nd Floor: Sifang Machinery Factory, Jinfang Sound and Video Company</p>
