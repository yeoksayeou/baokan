<h3>禍國殃民十大罪狀　陳逆公博審訉終結　十十日下午四時宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州五日下午九時急電〕天宇第一號大漢奸陳逆公博，經江蘇高等法院首席檢察官韓燾偵査終結，以十大罪狀向同院刑庭提起公訴。今日下午二時卅分，在第一刑庭公開審理。正午十二時，刑庭旁聽席上，已坐滿旁聽人士。二時正，法警奉命往司前街看守所提陳逆，二時卅分，審判畏孫鴻霖，首席檢察官韓燾，偕陪審推事石美瑜·陸家瑞，書記官蔡一亭等蒞庭，指定辯護律師高溶，亦隨同到庭。審判長等升座後，即命法警提陳逆上庭，站於被告　。先由審判長訊問被吿姓名年齡籍貫住址畢，即由韓首席起立宣讀起訴書，說明起訴意旨，然後由孫審判長命陳逆答辯，審訊直至晚八時半始吿終結，前後計歷六小時，庭上常即宣布，定本月十二日下午二時宣判。</p>
<p>陳逆神態自若朗誦八年回憶</p>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州五日下午九時五分急電〕今日自上午起，新聞記者已不斷出入於高院內外，一時餘，座位已滿，至二時三十五分，法警高呼「開庭」審判長高院院長孫鴻霖，主任推事石美瑜，推事陳家瑞等，即於萬人注目中升座。陳逆神態尙安，供稱：年五十五歲，廣東南浮人，住南京北平路六十四號，光緒三年，參加興中會後，即入國民黨。問：財產若干？答：房子是租的，財產請調査。首席檢察官韓燾，即起立宣布起訴意旨，略謂：被吿歷任黨政要職，而竟附和汪逆，離蓉飛河內，陳並至港，代在發表艷電後，乃參加僞組織，歷任要職，且以專使資格，去日答謝，毫不知恥，禍國事跡之大者，的有十端：（一）締結辱國密的，（二）資敵，（三）發行偽幣，（四）參加反英美戰事，（五）抽壯丁，（六）公賣雅片，（七）實施奸化敎育，（八）託詞淸鄕，殘害志士，（九）貪汚，（十）收編僞軍，禍國殃民，實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條一·二·三·四·五·八·十及十三款之罪。審判長繼命陳簡略作答，陳乃宣讀其自白書中之「八年來之回憶謂」：</p>
<p>（一）數年苦辛，不能不言，注於一二八時，主張抵抗，並因張學良之不肯抵抗，自要求張與彼同時下野。古北口戰事起，注特回國，共赴國難，但據將士報吿，火力太差，損失極巨。然塘沽協定，汪實不知，雖受攻擊，亦不加辯。二十三年，國內已漸分裂爲二派，奸人更從中挑撥，汪之家人，皆勸汪辭外交部長，陳亦爲勸，汪中心痛苦，僅謂：「那一個聖明人，肯做外交部長」而已。然因此戰，勢力懸殊，欲全國家無氣，又深恐中共坐收漁人之利，故即主和。（三）陳自謂反對在之和運，以爲無論和戰，均應舉國一致，且亦誤信日人，眞有誠意談和。但汪又不願老百姓與彼等同死。陳本人如留內地，蒙嫌更重，且欲勸阻在去日，但在堅不允去。後來由汪之還都，均已準備，陳知事已無望。（三）彼反對僞中日基本關係條約，亦未參加討論，以曾面告阿部重光等人，表示反對。彼亦反對華北特殊北，提倡三民主義，提倡廉潔政治，日人因目南京仍有敵性，稱在等爲和平抗戰。（四）汪死後，如立即解散寗組織，又恐無人負責，勢必大亂，但曾通電表明心跡，並强調黨不可分，國必統一。（五）日降後，力避日軍蹂躪地方，或與共軍勾結，並力維治安，但因軍校近衛師及海軍情形不穩，任援道再三囑避，以後已乃飛日本，臨行留長函致委座，言明一俟命令，當即來京待罪。（六）京組織終亦保存國家元氣，日本報紙亦言淪陷區民衆，痛恨日本，而覺世界尙在部落時代，應注意軍備，掃除文盲，從事技術，切不可祇求快樂。至此，休息半小時。</p>
<p>對起訴書答覆：（一）始終反對基本關係條約，對本多重光，皆明白表示。後訂同盟條約時，已取消華北駐兵等項，並吿小磯使者，如撤消聲明承認偽滿始能眞正和平。（二）南京已竭力爭取物資，保持國力，故有反抗不如和平抵抗之說。（三）立法院對中政會決議，不能負責；中儲券之發行，爲抵制日軍票。（四）南京參戰，乃欲乘此吸收資源，彼主張由我國調停日木對外戰爭。（五）否認抽壯丁，指為請傳。（六）販烟係日人欲得秘密經費，彼雖爲禁烟總監，實應由袁愈佺負責。（七）編僞敎科書，係維新政府時事，汪來後，始改國旗，並公開宣傳三民主義。（八）淸鄕木意在减少農村痛苦，不諱責，亦不願代人受過。（九）深惡貪汚之風氣，非一時所可轉移。（十）從不勸渝方人士參加僞府，調孫良誠至蘇北爲屛障東南，使勿淪共手。</p>
<p>爲汪辯護謂；汪已求和平，彼不贊成汪之勸吿，但同情汪之苦心。彼已完成統一之路，使東北不致蹂躪。陳逆繼要求發表其自白書。</p>
<p>問：旣不贊成和運，何以離川？又何以轉港至滬？答：係本革命同志之道義，並欲補救汪之錯誤。問：組府時知犯法否：答：就法律言為犯法，就政治言，實欲將此約日後路送渝後蔣同意。問：知影響抗戰前途否？答：反對汪之行動，同情汪之心情。問：去日何為？答：第一次為答禮，並質問基本條約不合理。第二次求訂同盟條約。問：你旣反對承認偽滿，保以此條取消。答：正在商酌修改。（下接第二版）</p>
<p>法庭上小鏡頭</p>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州五日下午十時零八分急電〕今日由監獄起解陳逆，原擬用包車，嗣以車夫不肯爲巨奸出力，乃改由馬車代步。</p>
<p>陳逆所經各處，沿途人山人海，均欲一覩巨奸之面目。臨街樓窗口，允多據高臨下觀看者。二時半開庭，在上午十時即有人前往高院，佔據旁聽席次。當記者於十二時抵達時，座位已去大半。下午一時，已經滿座，後來者祇得旁立。</p>
<p>開審前，老少年楊書記長，往來奔走，頗為忙碌。二時正，楊書記長宣示：（一）須檢視帝聽證，（二）不准抽烟，（三）不要亂跑，（四）禁止怪聲，（五）請各位端坐，以維法庭秩序。</p>
<p>米到開審時間，記者羣均已到達靜候。有女記者四人，圍坐一隅，在鄰座有少將級軍人數名，狀頗厮熟，談笑風生，頗有英雄美人之概。旁聽席上，不乏婦女，然四時開庭後，大都中途退席。</p>
<p>今日曾有唯一之外籍女賓，前來聽審，惟爲時已晏，無有座位，頗現窘狀。</p>
<p>二時廿五分，陳逆由武裝法警四人，押解步入法院大門。因時間未到，先步入第五候審室候審。二時半正，宣布開庭，全體肅立。庭長，推事，檢察官，書記官等，魚貫由側門步出，坐入正堂。旋陳逆亦由第五候審室押解至庭上。</p>
<p>陳衣嗶嘰夾袍，戴和尙帽，臨近法官前，將帽脫下，手持卷宗，緩步入庭，立被吿欄，狀頗自然。</p>
<p>先由庭長詢問年歲籍貫畢，詢問有無財產時，陳逆作强笑狀，答曰：這很難說，可請調査。</p>
<p>旋由首席檢察官縷述陳逆十大罪狀，歷時卅七分，當述及僞府淸鄉，爲害江北時，特別加重語調，蓋彼籍隸江北也。</p>
<p>審訊時，陳每一動作時，攝影機聲隨之而起，攝影記者亦利用强光燈之光綫，攝取鏡頭。</p>
<p>攝影記者蹲伏，或區僂其身，或側臨地上，現出各種美妙鏡頭。</p>
<p>當陳逆讀自白書時，讀至蔣主席，稱爲蔣先生，當由庭長予以糾正，改爲蔣主席。</p>
<p>陳逆之自白書，厚一英吋，六萬餘小字，三十餘頁。</p>
<p>陳逆口操國語，間雜粤音。</p>
<p>陳逆眼光欠佳，常觀看庭上交下之證據，輒臨時將眼鏡架上，完畢又將眼鏡除下，移上移下，頗爲忙碌。</p>
<p>陳逆往日僭稱主席，今日面對法庭，不知有何感想，</p>
<p>庭上置一留聲機，開放唱片，作爲佐證，首創審訊紀錄。</p>
<p>當陳逆讀完自白書時，臨了表示，處此現况，要怎樣審判，就怎樣審判，要怎樣判決，就怎樣判決均可。</p>
<p>陳逆二度要求庭上公開其答辯書，庭長答曰，此係法院之事，當考慮中。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕此問蘇軍連日大量撤退，據估計截至五日晨爲止，市內僅餘三千人，昨午後記者曾見輕巨型戰車十餘輛開往車站，此爲最後一批撤走之蘇軍戰車，市內防務名義上雖仍為蘇軍負責，然我方保安隊已開始擔當實際責任。蘇方對我保安隊之行動已不復加干涉。蘇城防司令部昨向市府社會局暗示，七日午後將有蘇軍一國撤退，該局已通吿各人民團體，定是日上午十一時在大同公園音樂壇舉行市民代表歡送大會。</p>

<p>〔中央社哈爾濱五日電〕共軍一部突於謙三日傍晚由韓家窕子一帶進至三科樹，四日上午進入市內太平區各路口，警察均被驅逐，全市空氣驟趨緊張。據傳道外南道街附近亦有共軍出現，內外呼應，民心大爲恐慌，各商店皆於下午三時半左右閉門停業。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕某權威方面今日謂：馬歇爾將軍對東北國共衝突擴大消息，深感不安，急欲重復其在華親自斡旋和平之使命，渠於下星期內可離美赴渝。又稱：馬歇爾及國務院僉信渠應速返，以阻止國共關係之惡化，惟馬歇爾對其任務之最後成功，仍極樂觀。渠相信最近國共間對東北問題之互相攻訐，大半在謀取得討價還價之地位，並非一裂痕擴大之表示。該方面又稱：馬歇爾將軍自聞悉華方將自行改善關係，毋需美方官員積極千預之說後，以爲有儘速返華之必要。馬歇爾及在華之美國其他官員，認鴛僅以顧問及調停人之身份行事，乃不可能者，如欲獲得任何進展，彼等必須積極領導。此間官員對東北問題深感不安，大抵係因彼等仍缺少有關東北政治。經濟及軍事情形之確切情報之故。渠等謂：馬歇爾返華華後，即可對東北各項問題獲致解決辦法。馬氏在其任務內，已獲得「若干進展」，此使渠在國共談判期間得以返美一行。馬歇爾相信，對渠努力之最大威脅，厥在僟饉，華中地區刻已發生此項現象。渠在此間竭力圖獲剩餘之船隻，俾將食糧運入長江，同時，在菲律濱·日本及其他各地，正徵訓內河船員中。權威方而獲悉：馬歇爾認爲，周恩來將軍乃一精明老練之討價還價者，但彼實係一極爲健全之人物，馬歇爾希望因此可獲得最後之解決。渠相信返華後與蔣主席及周恩來會談，再加以在低層加緊履行協定工作，可使大部份問題迎刃而解。</p>

<h3>陳逆公博受審經過　（接第一版）</h3>
<p>問：僞中政會議是否均國民黨員，答：大部皆是，一部靑年黨·國社黨·無黨無派者。問：第三次該會議決案中，有「重慶法令，一概無效」「對內對外」一切措施，均無效」，「軍隊停職待命」，「公務員均到京報到」，答：議雖然如此，但以後一切政令，均未依此辦理問問不承認中央政府？答：情形很複雜（美聲）問：僞府設施大綱，是否規定中日本條約全面和平，大東亞共榮圈，對日經濟提携？答：有之，但全面和，即汪等試探和平後，希望重慶贊成。問一你木人對承認僞滿事參預否？答：根本反對，故反對基本條約。問：卅四年二月廿六僞滿成立三周年紀急時你曾以行政院長名義廣播，主張中日滿合作，有嗎？答：記不淸。問；有唱片是你自己發音嗎？答：記不淸。是時庭上乃放唱片二次，問：是你說的吧？答：自己也不淸楚。庭上乃再開一次，陳謂聲背差不多，但不能確定，此無非例行公事而已。問：你代理偽主席期間，命令是否由你署字？答：是。問：褚任粤省長時，有分配烟圭電報往還，謂關土甚少僞滿洲國不能如期運來云云。答：袁愈佺負責，僅署余名，因余名義上係禁烟總監”至此，陳言本案極複雜，亦極簡單，請庭上隨便判決，彼決不說一句寃枉，亦決不訴。庭上宣佈調査證據完。檢察官論告：（一）中日同盟條約之取消治外法楓，及收回租界等等，在英美先取消之後，承認僞滿，已於被吿本人廣播中可見。（二）僞府應爲老百姓着想，何以派出若千統制會。（三）偽幣抵制日軍票足信，皆日本之主張，破壞我國之金融。（四）非英美協助，我國已亡，彼明知中央必勝，乃做一點工作，求免罪而已。（五）抽壯丁事，確係事實。（六）公賣鴉片，于被吿三十四年七月卅日致褚電中，已極明顯。（七）淸鄕害民最甚，淸　淸箱子底也。（八）本院偵査漢奸一千數百人，賄賂公費，到處可得證據。（九）僞軍騷擾，亦皆被吿所委，本春秋責賢者之義，陳應負責。（十）汪領袖慾太重，致行爲尙不及秦槍，陳旣屢諫不聽，何以不走，反做院長，且代其去”，一之不已，而達三次之多。陳再答辯謂：檢察官以賽秋實質者之義為言，彼殊不敢以質者自居，但汪獲得一切事務，彼皆負責，判決後決不叫一句寃枉，於再就十點，稍有答辯，尤重清鄉一點謂：此事終於三十二年八月，因彼反對而取消，謂彼陷害地下工作同志，祇能叫一句「大老爺寃枉」。彼所知及能助所及之地下工作人員，無一不保釋，下級人員違命妄爲，不能負責，如庭上必欲又春秋之義相責，則亦決不含糊，願意承當，但發江蘇省政府一科員犯罪，省主席亦須負責否？時公役辯護人高溶起爲代辯，特別指出陳曾成立無綫電台二處，一供地下工作人員，一供或雨農之用，即謂彼於抗戰有功，請予减輕。審判長乃宣吿辯論終結，定十二日下午四時宣判，退庭時已八時三十分。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>國都問題平議</h3>
<p>國都之有問題，見於本屆參政會所通過之決議。本屆參政會大會席上，有參政員評德珩等提出議案，請政府明定北平爲國都，案經大會通過，送請政府採擇施行。這一議案的被通過，著於官文書的紀錄，表示國人對於國都發生問題。在道以前，最近兩三年來，重慶及其他各地人士，對於所謂國都問題也曾有熱烈討論，或主定都北平，或主西遷西安，或更主張建都濟南長春。凡上所論，原爲個人私見，本不必加以重視。最近參政會通過之提案，已不復爲一二人私人之見，乃代表整個參政會的意見；而所謂參政會據說是足以代表民意的。今參政會通過請政府明定北平爲國都的提案，政府是否採擇，在政府固自有權衡，不過因此案之被提出而獲通過，我們却不能抹殺這個問題的存在，因此，也就不得不對這個所謂國都問題有所論列。</p>
<p>本來對於國都應該是一個不成問題的問題。辛亥革命，中華民國即肇建於南京，其後以袁氏執政而國都北要，國民革命的進行即遭到了阻力，未能施展。中國國民黨　完遂國民革命，開府廣州，出師北伐，旣克南京　　　志，遂又定都南京。從中國民族解放運動的歷史觀點言，南京之應爲我國國都，是毫無問題的事。今乃對建都南京發生疑問者，或則以爲其地接近上海，而上海爲罪惡淵藪，京滬密邇一隅，上海惡劣的習氣容易染到南京，形成所謂官僚與商商人的勾結，致使政風日趨窳敗；或則基於國防的觀點，以爲其地沿江鄰海，鑒於此次抗戰中的經騐，認爲地非安全，亟應擇地它遷，或則從歷史的觀點出發，以爲建都南京爲偏安一時之局，不足以宏建國規模垂諸永久；或則就地理的觀點，以為其地偏於東南，非爲全國的心臟；外此，更有就心理的觀點，以爲其地旣偏於東兩，對於邊疆施政，易致疏忽。凡上所言，雖屬件有見地，但一加深究，便覺難於維持。</p>
<p>政風的窳敗，不是地的關係而是人的關係；假使不從人的方而着想，而斤斤於地的選擇，以爲遷地爲良，其將沒有良好結果，何待多言。所以要改變日趨腐敗的政風，其關鍵不是在遷都而應該在擇人。至於就國防觀點論，目今的戰事，已是原子彈，長距離空襲，遠程火箭砲的時代，任何一地都沒有絕對的安全感。整飭國防，其關鍵不布遷都，而在我們全國上下的決心苦幹。再則此次抗戰，固然來自東面的海洋，而下一次的戰爭，何當能保證不來自西北的天空？南京當南北洋之衝，就國防的觀點言，亦不失爲一個重鎭。若就歷史的觀點，呆板立論，以爲南京建都祇係一時偏安之局，不足以宏建國規模，垂諸永久，此實係一種歷史上似是而非的迷信，不足以語今日科學昌明已臻入於原子能的時代。地理中心與國都爲兩事，國都往往不在一國的地理中心。蘇聯轄地自北太平洋的極東與美洲的阿拉斯加隔海相望，迄歐洲的波羅的海黑海，而其國都莫斯科却僻處西陲的歐陸。美國的國都華盛頓却在大西洋沿岸而不在其地理中心的腹部。英國的倫敦，亦何嘗不僻處不列顚島的東南？依上數例，可知國都所在與地理中心無關。至於整飭邊政，那亦完全是人的問題，決心的問題，而不是地點的問題。美國國都在大西洋沿岸的華盛頓，而其經營邊　遠至太平洋彼岸的菲列濱與疏球，蘇聯的國都在歐陸的莫斯科，而共邊疆的經營，遠至與北美阿拉斯加隔白令海峽相望的西伯利亞東端；足證邊陲的經營是一事，國都所在又是一事，兩者更無直接關連。</p>
<p>本屆參政會之通過請政府明定北平爲國都一案，所基理由如何，我們未曾獲讀其全文，無從推論。大的測之，不外北平密邇遼瀋，對於東北乃至邊疆施政，不致有鞭長莫及聞見不周之歎；况其地原為京，儘多官舍房屋可以利用。此外或更有若干歷史地理的迷信論者，以爲建都北平，可以控制全國，不若南京之偏於東南。我們認爲這些都不是爲定都北平的强有力的理由。南京之建都，與中國的國民革命遝動結著歷史的深緣，其地又爲國父陵寢之所在。過去國民革命的遭到挫折，半由於國都的北遷，袁氏及其它軍閥封建勢力的擴張。今國家當抗戰勝利之會，尤應在發動全面抗戰時國都所在地的南京，積極展開建國的大業，為國家立萬世的宏模。今參政會雖有此案的通過，我們覺得還以不必多所更張爲是。南京之爲我國國都，其情形彷彿與華盛頓之爲美國國都相似。我們要珍視南京在中國民族解放運動中所占的地位！</p>
<p>復次，國都的變更，表示政治的動盪不安今日可遷都北平，安知明日不更可自北平遷至蘭州，遷至武漢，乃至在嶺南的廣州？凡此均爲民族生活不健全的徵象。今國家値長期兵燹之後，　須於動盪之中，獲致安定。隨着國民革命的進展，自民國十六年國民政府奠都南京以來，其間亦曾積極致力於國都的建設，而當時未聞有對國都的建設發生異議。抗戰勝利，還都南京，是當然的事；而參政會乃於此際有此項逃都決議的通過，是亦國人失去自信的一種表示。關於國都的所在，個人的愛好是一件事，國家民族大計的所關又是一件事。我們依舊覺得建都南京是一個不成為問題的問題。我午要將南京建設起來，像美國人的建設華盛頓，土耳其人的建設安哥拉一樣。</p>

<p>問：谷部長來滬任務如何？答：近米上海勞工問題，頗爲嚴重，本人奉宋院長指示，來滬老察實際情形，並根據二中全會通過之「加速經濟復員緊急措施辦法」，與有關機關商討有效的消弭辦法。問：消弭工潮的方針如何？答：根據勞資協調的精神，一方面對工人的正當要求和合法利益，設法解決，並予以保障。一方面整飭勞動紀律，取締非法行爲，以安定工人生活，穩定生產秩序，達到加速經濟復員之目的。現在一般廠家，只注意增加生產，而忽視生產與勞工福利的密切關係。一般勞工，只注意增加工資，而不知工資的提高，應以產業的發展爲前提。所以勞資糾紛的消弭，根木說來，還是要勞資雙方對於經濟政策與社會政策相互配合的意義，有充分的認識和了解。問：二中全會通過的「加速經濟復員緊急措施辦法」規定，設置勞資評斷委員會，以遏止怠工罷工情事的發生，此項評斷委員會，本市何時成立。答：勞資評斷委員會的組織，現已商定，最近即可成立，該會的主要職權爲：（一）一般工人待遇之調整事項。（二）重要勞資糾紛之緊急處理事項。（三）交通公用事業及公營事業勞工糾紛之處理事項。該會成立後，將隨時督導廠鑛交通公用企業，調整工人待遇，以安定工人生活，防止發生糾紛。勞資爲生糾紛時應由該會評斷，其所爲之裁決，有强制執行之效力。又在復員期間，雇主或工人非經合法程序，不得因任何勞資爭議停業，或罷工怠工，如有違反，政府得予以有效的制止。照此辦理，本市工潮當可望逐漸消弭。問：本市社會局最近決定根據工人生活費指數按月調整工資，谷部長對此意見如何？答：根據工人生活費指數決定工資，頗爲合理。在抗戰期中，後方各省，即已如此辦理，最近因物價波動較劇，本市各工商企業，係按月調整，此後如能如此辦理，勞資糾紛，自可减少。但如生產與營業情况不佳，資方確難負擔，經勞資協議，或政府評斷，亦可照生活費指數减成發給。問：最近工人任意怠工罷工，且有包圍辦公處所，妨害廠方員司自由，及封鎖廠門，搗毁機器等情事，社會人士，頗滋焦慮，政府對此，將如何處理？答：此種行爲，均屬不合。最近勞工紀律，日趨敗壞，政府決予整飭，以期維護生產事業之安定發展，幷保陣工人之眞正利益。吾則長此下去，不惟影響生產秩序與社會秩序，將使生產愈陷於不振，工人失業之可能愈大，工人生活之改善愈感困難，深望各業工人切實瞭解此意，今後務須恪守勞工紀律。最近據報有非本業工人鼓動工潮，脅迫罷工情事，尤屬非法，自應由政府及軍警機關嚴予取締。問：社曾部對於失業工人的救濟，今後是否繼續辦理。答：仍當繼續辦理。惟現在各工廠逐漸復工，失業工人亦兌减少，且本部京滬特派員辦事處已依照規定結束，今後失業工人救濟工作，將移交本市社會局主持辦理。問：後方遺送來滬工人，如何安置。答：現已來滬者人數不多，此類工人，多係抗戰期中隨廠後遷者，數年來在後方努力生產，貢獻頗多。現政府已決定對此類工人，予以優先復業之機會。在未復業以前，並予以必要之救濟。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕谷部長定明日離滬飛京，後日自京飛返渝，約二星期後，自渝飛返京。</p>
<h3>中英合作館長　李約瑟博士抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中英科學合作館館長李約瑟博士，於災國三十二年間，自美來華，在後方工作，已歷三年，從事中英兩國間科學及工藝學之聯絡工作。今日將離滬取道香港返英劍橋大學，爲聯合文敎料學機構之籌備委員會，從事一時期之工作。英國新聞處特於昨日下午四時，似英領事署爲李氏舉行記者招待會，到各報社記者二十餘人。首由英國新聞處主任賴迦索里亞氏致簡短介紹詞，李氏即發表談話，對中英科學合作館之宗旨及過去工作闡述頗詳。</p>
<h3>商會建議五點　解除工業危機　請當局平情考慮採納施行</h3>
<p>上海市商會爲各業工廠因工潮引起危機，特電市政府。市社會局曁市臨參會，提出五項建議，原文略云：本會迭據各工業同業公會來會聲述，以目前工潮激盪，險象環生，請召集有關工業同業公會，商討切實有效辦法等情。經定期於四月」日，召集谷工業同業公會，推舉代表，來會舉行談話會。是日應邀出席者，有造紙工業，毛絨紡織，整染業，染織業，翻砂業，針織業等十七公會，分別陳述工潮澎湃，影響生產情形，有因對於工友工作，有所調動，工友引爲不滿而罷工者，有勞資雙方協議成立後，因工會不予同意而罷工者，有勞資協議成立後，勞方對於工資，又須另行依照其自定之標準，堅持異議而又怠工者。提高工友待遇之後。</p>
<p>工作效率　大見減低</p>
<p>按照常理，至少應保持其通常之工作效率，乃結果適得其反，工友大部怠於工作，產量日减。茲就毛絨紡織整染業之報吿爲例，據云，照該業生產紀錄，大都不及原額二分之一，就生產成本言，以前廠繳僅占全部成本的百分之二十，原料約占百分之八十，目前則原料僅占百分之三十，其餘百分之七十，悉有廠繳，而廠繳之中，又以工友方面開支居其大多數。其所提出改良待遇之要求，竟有以國營之中國紡織公司爲比例者，全不顧及各業有各業之情形，民營工廠之魄力，又萬難與國營工廠相抗衡，工友待遇，較諸戰前提高的六千倍，各廠雖力爲調整，而朝協成議，夕即推翻。毛絨紡織整染業同業之家數無多，十餘日內，罷工四次，實感難以應付。目前呢絨作洋定貨，連同關稅水脚，與國產價格相衡，約爲一與三之比，將來外貨湧到以後，國產呢絨危機，迫在旦夕。其餘各業情形，亦大致相同。而工友不明安危與共之理，隨時爲過當之要求，實堪歎惋。據到會各業所陳，目前各廠開工，並非有利可圖，實爲維持大局，免致造成多數失業恐慌，加增社會不安現象。將來外貨湧到以後，工資如再隨生活指數上升，各廠被迫停工，實有無可避免之勢。</p>
<p>怠工損失　甚於罷工</p>
<p>目前實際上所發生之困難情形，異常複雜，有爲市長所定四項原則中未能槪括者，據到會各業代表討論結果，彙一爲五項，謹提出建議如次：（甲）戰後建設，艱苦萬狀，如人民仍欲李受戰前生活，已非合理，故依照戰前實際薪資數目，再倍以每日生活指數，當爲最優越之待遇，如果須憑空另訂底薪，其數目超過當時實際之數倍，寗非過份。故此後社會局處理工資，應最高以戰前實支數爲基數。（乙）在未經合法調解仲裁以前，不准罷工，軍政機關，早有布告。但實際上，勞方絕不邀守，各業每次工資要求，都在先行罷工，以後允甚者，工人認罷工爲不合法，而施行怠工，不知工人罷工，廠方可以關閉廠門，並無損失，至怠工則照常生爐子，開機器，廠方損失允大。故怠工之禁止，尤應重於罷工。應請軍政當局重申前令，禁止怠工，吾則予以嚴懲。至聲請調解，希望社會局於事前調査廠方負担能力，平時待遇勞工情形，及職前實際支給工資數目，不當僅以討價還價之形式折衷一數字了事。蓋勞方明知當局採取折衷數字，則於提出時，故意提高，有時調解後所得反較勞方實際上所希望者爲高也。</p>
<p>調解工潮　注重紀律</p>
<p>（丙）調解之時，應絕對注意紀律，雙方代表人數，必須相等。最好採用法庭形式，吾則勞方聚集數千人至萬餘人，而資方代表僅五六人，層層包圍，自朝至夜。飲食不進，試問如何能得公平合理之解決。（丁）廠方對於行政權。用人權及處理事務，必須保持，勞方不得千涉，此爲管理上所必需者。（戊）法律的施行，必須全盤的，不能選擇其有利者行之，而拒却其不利者。因此目前勞資糾紛，勞方往往引用工廠法，但工廠法對於解雇手續，亦有明白之規定，如果勞方可依據工廠法而提出要求，資方自可依據工廠法而辦理解雇，以示法律平等權義相對。上述五項，均係依據法令事實，爲平允合理之請求。祈市政當局及主管當局，能予以平情考慮，即日採納施行，庶慰各業之望，得有稍紓喘息之機。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>處理工潮的方針和辦法</h3>
<p>勞資問題，在表面上，好像是對立的，實際上却並不是相反而是相成的。因為資方如果祇圖廉錢，忽略了工人的福利，勢必至引起罷工，怠工等糾紛，結果，資方的損失，往往遠過於勞方。市商會五項建議中，對於怠工所這的痛苦，可謂慨乎言之。</p>
<p>至於工人要求過分，使已開工的工廠，無以自存，未開工的工廠，裹足不前，致造成了許多失業，其於工人方面的損失如何，允不待繁言而解。</p>
<p>所以昨日谷部長的談話中所稱：『根據工人生活費指數決定工資，頗爲合理，……但如生產與營業情况不佳，資方確難負担，經勞資協議，或政府評斷，亦可照生派費指數减成發給」，這數語，我們認爲是一針見血之談。</p>
<p>本來這用生活費指數，作爲調整工資的原則，早經政府採用了。而『要求條件，如非今日中國生產狀况所能接受者，應予拒絕』，亦經市長宣布爲四原則之一。核其內容，與谷部長所定的方針，亦初無二致。所成為問題的，就是這個方針，如何切實的推行？</p>
<p>谷部長說：勞資評斷委員會的組織，現已商定，最近即可成立，該會的職權，除掉調整待遇，和緊急處理重要的勞資糾紛之外，還有防止發生糾紛，和強制執行之權力，對於一切不合法的行動，得予以有效的制止。果能照此辦理，吾想：上項方針，自可切實做到。所以我們很歡迎谷部長處理工潮的方針，尤其歡迎他處理工潮的辦法。</p>
<h3>臨時參議會八次會中質詢　收服民心要重實際禁烟連坐違反民治　……女議員更注意禁娼問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午爲市臨時參議會第三次分組審査會，下午三時十五分，舉行第八次大會，到參議員二十六人。</p>
<p>警察局報告</p>
<p>昨午由警察局局長宣鐵吾報吿該局工作：防止匪忠：（一）普設派出所，已成立者一二六所。（二）査騐民槍，已發自衛槍照一〇四五張，法團槍照七〇張，隨從槍照二六二張。（三）拘送游民乞丐。（四）裝設警鈴。（五）檢査旅館碼頭等。整理娼妓：凡經調騐無毒娼妓，將胸懸標識，已發登記證二四一三張。封閉按摩院二九家，　導社一〇八家，責令改營正當職業，規定娼妓活動之境。禁絕烟毒：至二月中止，已登化省六〇七人，規定三月底登說截止，六月底戒絕。加强交通管理：開闢單程交通，車輛改靠右行，組織交通巡察隊，組織中美交通委員會。整飭市容：劃一縣掛國旗，劃定攤販地點，取締搭蓋，固定雨棚，及違章建築，處理迷途及失踪兒童。加强戶口調査，整理外僑口卡及全市門牌，査騐外人護照等。又本市旅店，公共娛樂塲所，中西餐社等均在本局管理範圍內，並協同調在物價及調解勞資糾紛。緝捕盜匪：自去年九月十二至二月二十八日止，共發生匪案六八一件，破案者一五四件，獲匪四四四名，處理漢奸案共一三八件。消防　離工作；半年來救護火災共三二一次。</p>
<p>警局現有長警士，西八九人，官佐二，一二六人，半年餘來，警員因失職而被禁閉，懲辦，及斥職者計六〇二人。</p>
<p>敲詐勒索應嚴取締</p>
<p>宣局長報吿完畢，即由王艮仲提出意見數點：（一）警察局應改變殖民地作風。（二）衙門式作風，官僚作風，形式，武斷。及報銷主義，亦應改變。（三）什麽是當前急務？掛旗，裝警鈴等，雖均甚好，但與人民生活，無關痛癢。警局要收服民心，應重實際，不當專重形式。（四）僞警應速肅淸取消。（五）對人民身體，及家宅自由，應予保障，不應擅自拘捕佔領。（六）中美交通委員會之組織不適當。（七）戒嚴及閘北等地戰時戒備，均應撤消。（八）禁烟中有連坐規定，頗不合理，違反現代民治精神。今後希望警局少用權威，多近民衆，少做形式，多近實際。徐元誥請求警察應以慈悲心腸，對待人民，敲詐勒索等情，應嚴加取締。徐士浩詢問警局逮捕及拘禁人犯，是否依法規定？舊巡捕房缺點，雖不應再犯，但亦有可效法之處，即逮捕人犯應先得法院拘票，然後於二十四小時內解院。</p>
<p>變相娼妓近又復活</p>
<p>朱素萼首次發言，願爲全國同胞及後一代國民大聲疾呼：（一）關於變相娼妓，雖暫停一時，近又復活，是否調査再加取締？（二）私娼散布住宅區，經報吿後拘禁二三日，罰金一千元，即可放出，再作營業，有何辦法處理？（三）實行公娼是否確實？希望以後能依抽籤辦法，陸續减少以至禁絕，政府可以禁烟同樣制度禁娼。陸惠民亦提出同樣問題，要求調査取消變相娼妓。</p>
<p>警士待遇應予提高</p>
<p>趙班斧希望（一）提高警士待遇。（二）警官人數佔警局人員三分之一，應予减少，而增加警員，僞警不能全視爲漢奸，當究査甄別。（三）路名不易弄淸，交通警察應指點。（四）看戲不准抽烟，不能包括一切戲院，可否請戲院當局自定。沈鼎提詢：（一）吸烟者需登記，對販烟者有何處理辦法？馬路游民公開抽吸白麵，如何處置？（二）禁烟何時可眞正實行，希望以後不再聽到禁烟名詞。（三）有一部份交通警察常受賄賂，或開了紅燈在書攤上看書，如何維持交通？侯　人說市郊警察紀律太差，請糾正。</p>
<p>局長答復</p>
<p>宣局長予以一一答　：本市嚮導社共有一百七十餘家，按摩院二十餘家，除確改爲正當職業者外，均予取締。消極禁止私娼並無大用處，設立公娼目的，即在消滅私娼。市郊警察紀律，確屬較差，以後擬與市區內警察互相調用。警員人才缺乏，訓練所每年僅能訓練二千五百人，現七千餘人中，六千餘爲僞葵，如不利用工作將全部停頓，祇能逐漸淘汰。戲院吸烟，務必禁止，以後擬每院派女警十二名，實行勸導，以補警力之不足。禁烟正積極辦理，希望不復再犯，游民公開抽吸白麵，現尙未獲報吿，如果査獲，決予嚴辦。速坐命令乃行政院規定，各地均須遵行警局逮捕人民，一定依法，二十四小時內不能解送者，因偵査手續未完，法院調査工作由警局協同辦理。路牌係工務局負責，經市府核准，以後每路起末，均須豎立路牌，加指方向。門牌上加路名。不易看淸，無大效力。警員態度已迭次督導改善，宵警及設備戒除應由警備司令部規定，俟治安人員充實後，即可拆除。中美交通委員會之組成，乃因本市美軍車輛甚多，常發生肇禍等情，故有此建議機關，共同處理秩序。佔領住屋糾紛，有市府房屋租賃委員會或敵產處理局辦理，警局奉該二機關或法院命令後，僅執行應盡任務。大會於六時四十分散。</p>
<p>審查市政報告　各組推定人員</p>
<p>參議會第一，第二，第三審査小組，昨晨九時聯備燴行第三光華分組審查會議，審查市政報告及市府本年度施政方針，到參議員二十五人，議決由各組公推二人，負責審査，再報告大會複議。第一組推王艮仲，沈春暉，第二組推徐永祚，徐士浩，第三組推馮有眞，何炳松。市府各局報吿審査負責人，亦已分別推定，審査公用局報吿爲葉風處，水祥雲。審査公務局報吿，爲周學湘，吳任滄。審査地政局報吿，爲潘序倫，徐士浩。審査財政局報吿爲秦潤卿，王志莘。審査社會局報吿爲王冰，沈鼎。</p>
<p>軍警拘捕人犯　均應依照法令</p>
<p>上海市自由協會昨函市臨參會略稱：（一）査本市軍警機關，對逮捕或拘禁之犯罪嫌疑人，依法於廿四小時內，移送審判機關者固多，而事實上不於廿四小時內移送者，亦所難免。（二）軍警畏官，如無拘票，依法當無拘捉人民之權。（三）如接受被拘提或逮捕之犯罪嫌疑人，本市軍警長官，往往僅將案件移送，而將犯罪嫌疑人聲請繼續由其覊押，人民身體之自由，因此亦有被侵之嫌。該項聲請覊押制度，以及拘提人民，不憑拘票之辦法，均有調整之必要。</p>

<p>公債經前日劇漲後，實力派緊守陣脚，同時並將戰前私債法院有判令以一百二十倍償還傳說，向各方游說，吸引不少暴利主義者，狹窄之債市，經不起幾記做手，丙種晨開即跳高至四四〇〇元，最高哄到四六〇〇元，多方在凱旋聲中，紛紛出籠，遂打破四千元關，退至三九〇〇元，午刻略定，較前收計甲乙回跌三〇〇元，丙稱微降七十元，丁種跌三五〇元，戊種跌二五〇元，華股新多繼續加汕，上塲即穩，高價永紗見五六三〇元，美亞四六〇〇元，景福四六五元，其他較冷門各股倍形寥落，即如新光勤興亦呈窮途末路之槪，午刻各熱股亦高後稍疲，午收較前收計永紗漲四三〇元，美亞升二〇〇元，景福升十九元，新光勤興漲十元至二十元，午後喊價由微漲轉人微跌，外股昨堅後回落，多方雖有餘力，繼續活動，怡紗自晨開一三〇〇〇元，喊高至一三六〇〇元，英聯已不若前數日之鋒芒，僅能追隨紗廠而巳，西商逢高供給，最後稍形怯疲，各股回落半成左右，結果校前收除　業稍稍軋升外，餘均小挫，紙業漲勢較多，昨獨回落一成弱。</p>
<h3>新老港票　逐漸軋攏</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔仍隨金市稍有伸縮，初時在一九三〇元，惟此價難於支持，午前曾退至一九一〇元，午後在一九二〇元左右徘徊，甚爲平和，結果較前收微挫五元，港票形勢尙挺，新老續形軋攏，中途新老貨均呈漲勢，結果老貨平而新貨再升十元，羅比港電均平定。</p>
<h3>烚赤平穩</h3>
<p>烚赤昨市態平和，浮多後勁不繼，高價仍難持久，缺乏刺激，短時期中仍無晋展可能，晨開平穩，散戶仍有活動，曾升至一五一萬左右，高價稍呈掙扎，中行配價雖平，但買方陣容零落，持有省陸續了結，利用資金向股市推進，金市維持無人，午前復見一四五萬低價，而後稍稍回上，午後在一四八萬左右，交易不多，結果較前收微挫五千，銀樓飾金掛十六萬元，紋銀一千六，銀元亦吿穩定，暗拆形勢頗鬆，息價自一角五分至一角八分。</p>
<h3>條子鐵暢銷　定貨將到市價平疲</h3>
<p>日來條子鐵實銷，甚爲暢達，如製罐廠印刷廠鏡子廠等，皆有購進，而茶葉聽之所需爲尤鉅，然實銷雖盛，而行情仍未見起色，緣貨主以國外定貨，不一二月後即可裝到，故一洗已往扳持之態度，皆認爲乘機脫手，出淸存貨，此其時也。</p>
<h3>桂圓業公會　整頓售規</h3>
<p>本市桂圓業同業公會，以各行號在抗戰期同，售規異常紊亂，茲當交通漸復，一切可望照常，對售規有整頓之必要，爰經第一次全體代表大會議決，自即日起，凡各行向本市閩粤兩帮各號家進貨，無論業內業外，以及正式與非正式，一經成交，其銀期一律以十四天爲限，如遇必要時，或需縮短銀期，須視縮短日期之久暫，以拆息計明，在貨價內扣除，至於扣息之標準，每週由該會常務理事議定，分別通吿各會員，以資遵守。</p>
<h3>孟買金銀市場　最近漲風熾烈</h3>
<p>主因爲進口稅未增加</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕金融時報對於孟買黃金白銀市塲之熾烈買風發衣評論，謂國內外政局之發展情形，可能爲市勢繼續趨昂之成因，但其更較重要之因素，厥爲黃金白銀進口稅增加之遲未實行所致。按二月間印度預算表內已規定黃金進口稅率，每托拉純金鄧一八〇喱，抽稅廿五盧比，白銀進口稅率每英兩抽稅八安那。某財政界人士謂：印度國內物似，與國外物價已吿脫輻，故建議將稅率不時變動，俾在有條不紊之情形下，使國內物價與全球物價儘量接近，茍印度之市塲與供應來源仍吿絕緣，則鄰近全球物價一事，即無實現可能，蓋本地之產量，不足以供需要，而金鎊區所有黃金白銀可出售與印者，爲數甚少云。</p>
<h3>美商務部阻止　菲島貨物轉口</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐的五日電〕美國商務部已受權阻止將菲律濱在復興工作上急需之貨物轉運至其他國，如中國等，此等國家往往出價較高。</p>
<h3>美製捲烟即將派貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕捲烟市塲向無舶來品捲烟派貨，茲悉有某行經理之美貨捲烟，廿支裝「漢彌登夫人」，即日派貨，規定甲等會員每家二十條，乙等會員每家十條，每條派價爲七千元。開舶來品捲烟在市派貨之先聲。（德）</p>
<h3>煤市轉入疲境　柴炭繼續回降</h3>
<p>煤市仍趨疲落，人心虛軟，賣戶接踵，行情繼續軟化，市况難有起色，柴炭同業前向產地採辦各貨，現正絡續運滬中，故近來到源日旺，存底驟豐，銷路漸轉呆滯，市價逐步回降。</p>
<h3>彬同木湧到　閩浙皖贛產銷槪況</h3>
<p>我國東南諸省，除江蘇外，皖浙贛閩等省，均產木材，皖贛二省以產杉木著稱，贛杉木質堅靱，故價高於皖產，其集敵地以南昌及九江爲中心，戰前贛杉熱銷京滬沿綫，木商多去南昌九江採運應銷。</p>
<p>皖杉質地較次，然產塡頗豐，以屯溪為集散中心，戰時新安江上游兩岸杉木山築，今水運已暢，皖杉正大批下運，均至杭州集中，現杭價每兩八萬四千元，今後皖杉湧到，價將看降，皖杉在屯溪每兩祇售三萬餘元，由屯至杭運費每兩需八千八百元，有運輸公司承運，惟山貨趨漲，故在屯不易購得，皖杉因遝轍便利，且價較贛杉爲低，故目下暢銷蘇南各地，已取贛杉而代之。</p>
<p>他如浙江中部亦產杉木，惟質地更次，几多係小料，其集散地在杭州，浙產除杉木外尙有同木，產於溫州等地，謂之「溫同」，現滬價每兩四萬五千元。</p>
<p>至於福建則以同木爲主要產品，謂之「閩同」，馳名國內外，上等棺木材料多爲此項「閩同」，京滬等地向稱暢銷，木商多去福建山地採購，紮縛船隻兩旁，拖運來滬集中，批售各地。</p>
<p>據悉現本市已大批遝到杉木同木，故木價已趨下游，美松亦有大量抵埠，故今後建築工程之木料，當可無虛缺乏。</p>

<h3>美國紙產增加　但仍供不敷求</h3>
<p>美國因戰後建設及建築房屋需用木材甚多，且因工資提高，致影響造紙成本，最近所出紙料，遠不及從前標準：所謂最優等之「勝利紙」，已成明日黃花，據悉美國今年內紙張產量，實際上較去年同一期內所產量爲多，惟因各國戰後需求突增，故無法應付，且此種供不應求之狀况，或有延長之可能云。</p>
<h3>中國猪鬃　向美國求出路　企圖奪回原有市塲</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕昨日商界人士吿路透社記者謂，猪鬃來源甚暢，尤以中國之到貨爲最多，此使美國在滿足國內及輸出需要方面極爲有利，去年最後三個月，美國每月猪鬃輸入數量平均爲一五五·〇〇〇磅，今年最初三個月之輸入入量想必高出甚多，重慶與漢口目下並不以猪鬃供給美國，因中國內部勞力與運輸上有困難之故，但中國境內之一致傾向，顯欲奪回整個美國市塲，蓋在戰時，此一市塲已爲印度與南美猪鬃商所有，目下中國方國向美國提出猪鬃與運費之價格，爲天津有五元一磅與五元六角一磅兩種，上海有二元九角一磅一種，上兩星期之定價爲六元，六元六角與三元二角五分，在過去一月中，美國猪鬃銷往英國者，爲數頗多，但目下此項銷路已激减，因英國供應部不願撥出美匯，該部本身或有相當數額之存貨，必先將其用罄，去秋法國曾購去大量猪鬃，以後即時斷時續，最近問又在市塲上購進。</p>

<h3>弱小與母愛　（續）</h3>
<p>— 王文新</p>
<p>爲紀念抗戰勝利後首届兒童節而作</p>
<p>愛爲一切生之根本，宇宙間無愛則一切生意滅絕，人與人但有旁觀利用，處詐，相爭相殺，冷酷無情，一切幼小者無以生長，柔弱者絕難自存，危難者無以免死，人世間但有險森·冷酷·無復光明·溫暖·方今戰爭·飢饉·貧窮·愚昧·及種種權四慾，優越感，使全世界人羣多數喪失本性，變爲冷酷無情，祇知利用。夫弱小有何可以供人利用之處，但有飄零顚沛，躑躅無援，絕望而待斃，人種之綿延，天地之生機，莫危險於此矣。挽救之道，首在提倡人類相愛，人人以慈母愛子之心，愛憐一切弱小，扶育一切弱小，「安得慈母心，照臨溝中瘠？」天地間一切皆不免帶多少假藉，惟有慈母心最高尙，最光明，從靈魂最聖潔處自動發出獻身的愛，不計報酬，不計代價，對方愈弱小無用，愈特加愛憐，一味「以他人爲中心」犧牲自己，成就他人，殷勤扶育，使之長成。「辛勤三十日，母瘦　漸肥」，母愛之偉大無倫，其一即在於犧牲自己，成就他人，其次即在其不計對方美惡及一切功利，一味篤愛。一隻母性蝴蝶，用其全副精神，保護一隻素昧生平之後一代生命，安放卵子於花樹根旁較宜孵化之溫地，而自身郤死於近旁之濕土。叔本華以爲世界意志，發動在求種族自身之永久生存，母愛犧牲精神之高度表現，即在完成世界意志。回時親子之相互默契，相互理解，精神上之相互交流，亦成爲人與人相互結合之最好榜樣。「母顏如朝旭，溫厚復慈祥，母恩如滄溟，萬里悵汪洋，一，使人人皆以偉大之慈母愛爲榜樣，同情弱小，扶育弱小，成就他人而不計功利得失，則人問將不知如何溫和可愛？願天下爲付親者，勿令最可驕人之固有母性愛須臾或失！天下一切成長者，以慈母愛爲榜樣，擴充其對幼小之同情憐愛，扶育弱小，勿令勢利，冷酷，陰森之氣象再在滋長人間！</p>
<p>今當抗戰勝利後首屆兒童節，吾人望滔滔天下，强爭弱死，愈不禁深感於萬千飄零弱小之未可輕忽，人間母愛之彌可流連，謹撰斯文，以爲呼籲；並申其義，以具體建議於當局及有心人之前：</p>
<p>（一）今後學校敎育，自國民學校越，在語文及其他含有品德陶冶功能之課程中，關於發揚母愛及一切同情弱小，老弱含有聖潔感情陶冶之敎材，宜佔有相當分量，最低限度，不能少於灌轍知識之敎材分量。</p>
<p>（二）在社會敎育方面，對發揚母愛，同憐弱小老弱之通俗讀物，唱本·歌謠·音樂·影片·戲劇·及一切藝術創作及演出，宜儘量提倡獎勵。</p>
<p>（三）在民俗方面，除積極提倡愛助弱小，敬助老弱，慈愛，孝順諸善襯外，凡在習慣歌謠諺語，口頭語及戲劇表演中，有涉及褻辱母性及玩弄弱小，摧殘弱小成分者，宜力予弭絕。</p>
<p>（四）在法律方面，憲法中宜特訂保護母嬰專條，在民刑法中，涉及危害母嬰之處，宜儘予保障。</p>
<p>（五）全國交通碼頭，對婦孺老病，應如優待軍警及公務八員，專　售票，上下舟車，應准婦孺老病先行。</p>
<p>（六）在災荒及危難救濟時，對各地母嬰，應優先救濟。</p>
<p>（七）在醫護方面，全國各地方應普設衛生所，以產科及兒科爲必不可少之部門。</p>
<p>（八）其於反功利，重道義，及種族綿延繁榮之必要，全世界所有岡家，應以保護母嬰爲共同政策。</p>
<p>（九）在戰爭發生時，對於敵國之母嬰，應絕對禁止虐待或殺害。</p>

<h3>蔣主席　對參政會發表　政治報告　全文（下）</h3>
<p>政治協商會議及憲法原則的商討，在政治協商會議五項協該案中憲法草案修改原則一項，具有特殊的重要性。憲法是國家的根本大法，而憲法的最後決定權，當然在國民大會，但是在憲法沒有制定以前，全國人民無論何人，如有良好的意見，都可提出來，作爲決定憲草的參考。政治協商會議憲法草案小組，旣已匯合出席各方代表的意見，更決定組織　革　議會，其開會時間定爲兩個月。</p>
<p>憲草審議縝密　提供國大採納</p>
<p>在這兩個月中，憲草審議委員會的工作，是根據協商會議措施之修改原則，並參酌憲政期成會，修正案憲政實施協進會硏討結果及各方面所提出之意見，彙綜整理，製成五五憲草修正案，提供國民大會採納。</p>
<p>中國國民黨二中全會對於憲法章草案修改原則，予以周詳矜愼的審査，在審査報吿提出大會以前，國民黨出席憲草審議會的代表，將本黨多數中央委員的意見向憲草審議委員會提出討論，於是上月十五日憲草審議委員會與政協綜合小組的聯席會議，就下列三項獲得協議；（一）國民大會爲有形之國民大會，（二）憲草修改原則第六條第二項取消憲草修改原則第六條第二項規定，如立法院對行政院全體不信任時行政院或辭職或提請總統解散立法院，但同一行政院長不得再提請解散立法院。（三）省憲改爲省自治法。</p>
<p>上月十六日二中全會纔接受憲草修改原則的審査報吿，決定授權員會負責處理審査意見爲左列五項：</p>
<p>（一）制定憲法應以建國大綱爲最基本之依據。</p>
<p>（二）國民大會應爲有形之組織，用集中國會之方式，行使建國大綱所規定之職權，其召集之次數，應酌予增加。</p>
<p>（三）立法院對行政院不應有同意權及不信任權，行政院亦下應有提請解散立法院之權。</p>
<p>（四）監察院不應有同意權。</p>
<p>（五）省無須制定省憲。</p>
<p>憲法尚未頒布　約法根本有效</p>
<p>二中全會對政治協商會議的協議案所成立的決議，明白宣示了中國國民黨竭誠信守，努力實踐的決心，而全會根據國父遺敎對於憲法原則提出意見，態度是極爲謹愼。事先旣由本黨代表提出憲草審議委員會與綜合小組得到協議，事後復授權中央常會處理，以期穫取各方的諒解，凡此都足表現其容忍退讓委曲求全一貫的苦心。不料中共代表團發表聲明，指責二中全會造成違反政協決議之混淆情形，這究竟是什麽人造成混淆情形，究竟什麽人造作這種混淆是非的宣傳，明眼人自然了解，不待多言，但是我們政府仍本忍讓爲國的方針和他們繼續潛心硏討，靜候解決，不料中共代表前幾天在綜合小組中，突然又提一議案，使我們非常詫異。他們主張「由訓政到憲政過渡時期，訓政時期的法應即廢止，山各黨派依平等合法原則，共同參加的國民政府，其組織法應依照政治協商會議關於政府組織的協議製訂」，本席對於這一重大問題，有略予說明的必要：</p>
<p>訓政時期約法是民國廿年國民會議制定的國家組織法，這一部約法，只有國民大會制定的憲法纔能够代替。在憲法尙未頒行之前，訓政時期的法，是根本有效的。要知道國家不可一日沒有政府，政府不能一日沒有法律，尤其是國家與政府所依據的根本大法——的法。我們國民政府就是根據訓政時期的法而成立的，而且根據訓政時期的的法而行使其喊權。倘若憲法尙未頒行，而的法光行廢止·中國就沒有合法的政府，國家就要陷於　　　狀態。</p>
<p>我們政府以及二中全會，都尊重政治協商會議，持有最大的決心，要實行政治協商會議的協議案。但是我們要說明政治協商會議的性質。政治協商會議，在本質上，不是制憲會議。政治協商會議關於政府組織的協議案，在本實上是不能够代替約法，結束訓政的步驟，只有召集國民大會，若要代替的法而爲憲政時期國家組織所依據的根本大法，那只有國民大會所制定的憲法，所以國民政府在政治協商會議開會時，再三宣示此次擴充政府的組織，是在國民政府現有的基礎之上，要求各黨派人士及社會賢達共同參加，來擴大政府的範圍，而決不是推翻現在國民政府的基礎，另外來組織一側政府，這個道理，幾乎是中外管知的，因之可以明瞭我們此次擴大政府組織的目的，乃在使政府於此由訓政到憲政的過渡時期，匯合全國的意見，集中全國的力量，贏得和平的勝利。共商建國的方策，準備國民大會的召集，樹立憲政實施的基礎，而其中還有一種委曲求全的苦心，就是要把現在國內許多非法的事實，導入合法的軌轍，倘若憲法尙未頒行，而的法先行廢止，則政府窮六個月之力所得到的結果，乃不是和平而是混亂，不是統一而是分裂，不是人人可以共循的合法軌轍，而是人人可以造亂的非法禍胎。這與我們召開政治協商會議的宗旨，是完全違反了。如政治協商會議果眞成爲這樣一個性質的會議，我們政府與全國人民，是決不能承認的，否則中國國民黨五十年革命努力的結果，對於全國國民應得的政權沒有一個交代，而我全國同胞八年抗戰的犧牲，亦沒有一點意義了。這不僅是政府所不能接受，也是全岡人民所萬萬不能容許的。</p>
<p>各位先生，上面所說，是國民政府六個月來爲和平建國而努力的經過。國民政府對外則遵守國際公法，崇尙條約信義，對內則採取忍讓爲國的方針。凡有利於和平建國的措施，必委曲遷就，期其實行。政治協商會議的協議，軍事衝突調處的辦法，整編國軍及統編中共部隊的方案，都是政府忍讓爲國的精神所產生的。政府持有最大的誠意和決心，使其一一見諸實施，現在最迫切的一件事，就是協商會議所議決的國民政府委員會的成立，我們正在斯待各黨派提出名單，使國民政府擴大範圍，集中各方意見和力量的願望及早實現！（完）</p>

<h3>桂省飢民圖　搶喫樹皮菜根發生械鬬　造成「飢餓」選舉</h3>
<p>春深了，南國的英雄樹，花開花落，滿地紅茵，一天飛絮的愁舞裏，面對着這一個最易使人發思無限的季節，眼望着慘澹的環境，身處在飢餓的沉淵，人們的心頭眞說不出是酸是苦。柳絲新長，細雨未歇，日來料峭春寒，雖然這裏看不見春來飄雪，但是大家都彷彿還站在冬天的邊緣上。</p>
<p>可怕的災荒，造成了刦後的凶年，桂北二十多縣的災民，興奮地迎接了勝利，同時也毫無抗拒地投入了荒年的懷抱，一面是旣得利益階級和官僚資本集團對着飛奔的物價得意地狂笑，一面是無靠無助的農民在啃着草根，流着無聲的眼淚。別人聽盡了三湘哀鴻的啼喚，撫憫着濱湖的災黎，鄕裹知道桂北鹿寨·中渡一帶每天也有一定要餓死四五十人的慘聞？那裏知道全縣爲了一片蕉樹林的搶奪而械鬥了直個月的事實，（蕉樹的皮就是他們的飯）！廣西的孩子太會忍耐了，沒有參議會的議長替他們到中區去呼籲，通訊的機關也沒有半點的報道，難民們只是在死神的獰笑下面，熬過了冬天，又熬過了春天，死者已矣，生者待救，今天，我們要圿廣西的孩子大聲的控訴！</p>
<p>秋冬無糧春來苦飢　結隊挖取野食</p>
<p>災荒的蔓延在廣西，東西南北一樣的慘，尤其是湘桂沿綫的縣份，一刦於兵火，再刦於虫旱，去年兩季，顆粒無收，鹿寨·中渡·　城的難民，自從去年九月起，一直到現在爲止，大槪餓死的已在萬人以上，秋冬無糧，春來苦飢，人民十九離家遠去，成羣結隊到山裏去挖取野茨菇，野茡齊和　薇的根而食，人民一點慾望也沒有，只是能够找到，枝肥大而又嫩一點的根苗來塞進口裏。便會苦苦地笑，笑，啊！這些今世以至千萬世都沒有人憐憫的伯夷叔齊們，甚麼是他們的芥天呢？　容以北五十里的一個村莊裏，一家五口，爲了連野茨菇都沒得吃了，於是父親把三個子女殺死，然後失妻縣極自盡，眞是聞者悲酸，天愁地慘！全縣·興安·靈川·灌陽，以迄桂東賀縣·八步一帶·也早就陷入了恐怖之鄉，曾經有一個記者問一個來自賀縣的紳嘗：「貴縣是否最近也鬧着飢饉？」那紳耆慘慘一笑地回等：「啊，最近？我們的家鄕去年十月就開始吃着草根！」一聲河滿子·結果是大家都沉　地低下頭來。</p>
<p>埋屍者謂我今抬屍　明日誰來抬我</p>
<p>桂北一帶的鄕村大抵餓死人變成一件平常到沒人注意的事，撞埋屍首的人會感慨地說：「今天我抬死人，曉得明天誰來抬我！」難民挖野菜挖蕨根的時候，往往會挖起一具死屍來，不過，所幸的就是還沒有到人吃人的地步罷了。至於全縣的四維，和平，三里等鄕，因爲挖菜根而械鬥的慘聞，雙方早就變成麻木和失去理智。一個村長紅着眼睛說：「打也是死，餓也是死，還留這條賤命有個屁用！」還有同安村謝十妹一家七口吃野芹菜九日，舉家中毒　斃的新聞，也布痛苦地刺繳着每一個創傷的心房。桂東南龍州以至梧州一帶，還有一種吃了必死而又不得不吃的「食糧」，就是一種叫做「觀音粉」的泥十，吃的時候可以充飢，不上十日，便要肚皮　腫地送了性命，但是除了「觀音粉」以外，難民的麵粉在甚麽地方呢？</p>
<p>准許職員停薪留職　政務陷於停頓</p>
<p>糧荒聲中，還有兩個痛心的柯曲，一個是因爲春耕新無種無牛（廣西的耕牛在戰爭中損失了百分之七十五）於是佃丁向地主退批，地主不能白受損失而拒絕，因而增加了許多嚴重的糾紛，結果是田地兩邊都不管，荒蕪下來，去冬　收的慘象未已，今春的情景又如此，實在不堪設想。</p>
<p>還有一個，就是爲了沒有地方稅項的收人，遭受災荒最重的縣份，只有准許職員停薪留職，另謀生路，以至政務停頓，人心渙散，形成了無政府的狀態，治安大成問題。有些縣份則在無法無天的抽着富力捐，重重剝屑，以冀維持殘局，結果是更使民不聊生。</p>
<p>對於這些悲慘的現象，和不難想像的嚴重的後果，省當局不是沒有注意，但是我們可以坦白的說一句：省當局是注意而沒有辦法，請求多而工作少，光是錢來的時候，難民已經要餓死了大半，何况有沒有錢來還是一個疑問？不過話也得說回來，沒有錢又怎麽想辦法？說來說去，還是苦倒了苦透的災黎。</p>
<p>縱使分得一匙米漿　難民心中亦甘</p>
<p>最近聽說已有麵粉五千噸首途運桂，並且救濟分署已允將第二期業務費一億四千萬元全部放賑收復區各縣，以作農民購置種籽肥料之用，並撥二千萬元在桂林修建難民宿舍。雖然僧多粥少，難民分到一匙米水心頭也得甜一甜，願上帝保佑那些繁苛的請貸手續不要出現，更願麵粉和錢都眞正落到災民的手裏。</p>
<p>最近救濟分署並決定用「以工代賑」「以耕代賑」的方式，興修水利，利用災民修築如柳州鷄喇，永福金鷄河武鳴，武緣江等地的水堤，以及大規模開辦柳州沙埔農塲，發動春耕，雖然緩不濟急，有一個模樣也是好的。</p>
<p>還有爲了米的可愛，桂省決定禁釀。爲了保存田地的力量，決定了禁宰耕牛，看着春耕時候，農夫俯在水田裏死勁地自己拖動着那一把犁扒，你能够想到這還是人做的事情嗎？但是，今天廣西的農民却十九在自已做着牛。</p>
<p>最後一個關於糧荒的消；今天桂東北的米已經突破了四萬元的大關，幾萬包軍糧正被運出梧州，所謂企業公司正在向米堆裏鑽，大量的教購，大批的採買，用利潤去救濟公司的保險籍了。</p>
<p>司徒喬夫婦來寫生　繪圖運美展覽</p>
<p>爲了替七百萬災黎寫下一幅飢饉圖，救濟分署請了名畫家司徒喬夫婦來桂實地寫生，準備把八桂災民的慘象，拿到美國去展覽，原因是爲了希望多獲一點救濟，道日子，顧全肚皮第一，面子間題留待肚飽後再商量吧。</p>
<p>飢餓　裏，各縣的民衆帶着一個空虛的心靈，一面啃樹皮，一面在民主的氛圍選釋省參議員，選舉鄕鎭長，於是熱中於「代表」，熱中於「公僕」的人，起勁地活動，眞是「有錢出錢」，「有米出米」，只要你投我一票，我便圿你解決明天的伙食，替你家裏想辦法。就這樣，村長甲長吃到不亦樂乎，「候選人」今天請酒，明天替他們縫新衣裳，看在一票的面上，飢民們多少也得一點餘惠，花樣百出，好個民主，無以名之，名之曰「肌餓的選舉」。</p>
<p>大學生討厭鷓鴣江　高喊回梧州去</p>
<p>大家正給「吃」的問題弄到焦頭爛額的時候，一羣住厭了柳州鷓鴣江的廣西大學的孩子，又在鬧着要回梧州去，而且越鬧越兇，竟然弄到大罷其課。月初還在柳州舉行了一次大示　的畫行，最初還以爲他們是爲收回東北而請命，那知却只是爲了要回梧州而已。接着便是罷課·捐款·弄車·弄船·弄到天翻地覆，一直到現在還沒有上課，敎部派督學來調處，硬是沒辦法，學生在督學到校的時候，貼標語，呼口號，有一條是「柳州的鷓鴣江是地獄，梧州胡蝶山是天堂」，敎育部撥了四千萬給學校搬返桂林，並撥了以前的電工器材廠做理工學院的校址，但是學生老是鬧着要到梧州去，（大概是梧州離廣州近一點），怎樣也不肯上課，結果是校長李運華弄到一籌莫展，在重慶辭了職，嗣即由陳劍修任校長，聽說陳氏對於這一件事件，也頗頭痛，不大願意馬上到差。</p>
<p>堯山香火冷落不堪　漓水東去如咽</p>
<p>桂林的師範學院，聞將於暑假遷邕寗，大家倒很願意。作家穆木天夫婦，仍在師院任敎。最近桂林成立了一個文化界聯誼會，並且發表了一篇二千多字的宣言。以前頗有名氣的桂林GOEX電台，也打算在最近恢復廣播。春天裏，惟一能够發芽的種子，就祇有文化事業了。</p>
<p>三月天時，正是桂林堯山的香火勝會，往年此日，不知有多少善男信女，頂禮焚香，可憐今年多少盛事，都已不勝滄桑之感。堯山脚前，凄風苦雨，遊人冷落，人們的心情早就給東去嗚咽的漓水冲洗凈盡，誰叫萻薩無靈，給人們這樣一個大苦大難？（三月二十五日）</p>

<h3>請本市當局廢除警報</h3>
<p>主筆先生：自日寇乞降，河山光復後，本市當局對於日寇在滬時之警報設備，並不加以取締，而規定每日中午十二時及每星期日上午九時施放，使全市居民聆聲，知所警惕，此種辦法，容有未善，茲臚列鄙見如次：</p>
<p>（一）日寇盤據本市時，施放警報，奚止千百次，市民一聞其聲。不寒而慄，因此變成心臟病者，不乏其人，刻下天日重光，旣無確實空襲情事發生，自不應再令全滬三百餘萬市民，聆此恐怖聲音，以致影響心腦安寗，而不能安居樂業。</p>
<p>（二）前因日寇頻放空襲及警戒警報，已促成了許多心臟病的同胞，若輩因目前環境尙未能改善，生活程度日高，身體營養不足，病廢或未脫離，倘再續聞警報聲浪，雖非寬襲，猶有餘怖，若輩之病，恐難早日根治。</p>
<p>（三）戰時市民一聞無報，不獨驚惶失色，且爭相購備日用品及各種糧食，刺繳物價上漲，確屬實情，為避免刺激物價高漲起見，在本市安全時期，似有取締警報之必要。</p>
<p>（四）刻下國際風雲，尙未完全消散，設將來不幸發生第三次世界大戰，則本市難保不再有實施正式警報之舉，故目下應即麽除，以免影響將來正式警報之效力。</p>
<p>上述各端，不過舉其犖犖大者，其餘有關問題尙多，恕不罄述，擬請本市當局迅予考慮，倘確認鄙見爲理由充足，立將警報廢除，國家幸甚，市民幸甚！</p>

<h3>小型週報與社會風氣</h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>新聞紙的責任，是以領導社會思想，啟迪民智為目的。但旁流所及，就有許多弊病。例如帶彩色的新聞紙另有他們的目的，再如把某種新聞材料故意作無謂的渲染，這徒使讀者多費寶貴的光陰罷了！</p>
<p>最近上海小型周報風起雲湧，登戰的消息多半夾雜色情為號召，雖有「正派」一些的，但是少極了！在此紙張昂貴的情況下，不知給他們胡亂化費了多少，非但暴殄天物，並且還能影響社會風氣，使若干意志不堅定的青年，受了壞的暗示。</p>
<p>例如從前「孫老勃曼」一案，使巴黎小報銷售至五十萬份之多，但影響所及，比利時和義大利兩國的罪案就因之增加。</p>
<p>所以對於帶有色情或誨淫作品的，希望社會局和警察局會加以嚴厲取締。</p>
<h3>新中國的靈感：　古希臘的追懷</h3>
<p>— 顧樑</p>
<p>羅念生作「希臘漫話」介紹</p>
<p>「希臘文明」，多麼樣子的一齣無頭戲！「是世界文明的最高峯，是近代文明的泉源：近代的哲學，文學，藝術以及民主政權都是從希臘傳來的；……」（第六面）然而，漢大淺出，輕描淡寫了希臘文明的，在我們的文字裡，到現在為止，恐怕還不容易發現好像羅念生先生「希臘漫話」那樣的作品，雖然它不過是薄薄的一本小册子。（年青的朋友們，先睹為快吧；這本小册子在內地已經出版了整整三年，但是在收復區仍舊可以說是簇新的。）</p>
<p>我們認識一宗文明，自然先從它的基本精神着手，希臘文明的精神是什麼呢？作者提出了主要的特點若干：求健康，好學，創造，愛好人文，愛美，中庸，愛自由，身體好，肯用功，愛「人」，愛美，愛自由，總而言之，是一宗創造的人生觀，沒有問題，可以受到歡迎，祇不過中庸那一點，至少在我們大多數的年青朋友，恐怕極不入耳，但是，我們的作者却這樣說：「希臘人遵守中庸之道，遵守The　Gold　en　Mean，他們不過度，不走極端，」而且他更強調：「這是希臘人生活的秘訣。」又說，「希臘人善於把個人與政府，靈魂與肉體，理想與現實調和起來，善於把兩個極端連接起來。他們的文學裏從沒有反叛運動，正因為他們的理智與感情是融洽的，形式與內容是和諧的。」（第十三面）</p>
<p>此外，有一點使我們相信希臘人是更值得我們敬愛的，同時他們更是「人」，儘管我們的作者那樣惝恍迷離地說：「人性裏面似乎只有愛情不是希臘人所能了解的，他們甚至認為這東西會貶低文學的高貴性，這和我們的觀念多麼不同。直到如今，雅典城白日裏沒有男女的追逐，可是到了夜裏，他們夜夜有月光，全城的青年都配成了對，嬉笑高歌，連園中的鳥兒都不肯入睡，這是我所不能了解的。」（第十一面）作者「所不能了解的」正應該是我們特別「能了解」希臘人的地方。</p>
<p>儘管漫話希臘，作者寫這本册子從頭到底忘不了祖國。開門見山，第一篇文字就是「古希臘與中國」。其實，這本册子整整的都恐怕是在一種「古希臘」的追懷和「新中國」的憧憬交響的心境中寫作成功的，筆者現在此刻也似乎身處在同一的心境中給我們的青年讀者推薦它，「希臘漫話」的作者不至於以為我是過分唐突了他寫書的初衷吧？關於忘不了祖國那一點，我不想多舉例引錄了，因為凡是肯處懷若谷讀書的青年朋友，一定都會聰明智慧地領悟作者處處流露的那一番苦心。在結束「古希臘與中國」的時候，作者做了兩場美麗的夢，第一場是散文的，他惋惜中國古藝術品的流落異域而希望着「我們的亞歷山大必能東去把它們取回。」第二場是韵文的，他在陳述我們所接受了的希臘影響之餘這樣說：「如果有人肯在那些山道上或海道上去尋找，許還可以找到古希臘的歌舞隊翩翩飛舞來到唐宋的宮前時所遺下的踪跡。」（以上見第五面）那原來就是中國舞樂史上的一項艱難但是又重要又有興趣的課題，或許我們已經有着比較超俗的學者寂寞地在研究，在發掘，在整理中。</p>
<p>作者「曾經在希臘住過一年」（序），他親切地追記那裏在風光，「雅典之夜」（第三篇）是和他最近出版的隨筆結集「芙蓉城」（寫在都風光）屬於同一優美玲瓏的調子的：「九根光柱，每一根下面供着一位女神，……你該記得Erato，她手中抱着一架絃琴。這時候也許，有人在呌　Erato，那不是什麼時候人在神前祈禱，只是人家在呌那賣花的女郞。她捧着滿懷的玫瑰，Roda呀Roda（玫瑰）！」「不用部天氣好不好，那天氣一定是好的，一年有三百個晴天。」「不過我還是勸您去看希臘雜劇，聽東方調子，那聲音拖得很長，你也得隨着大家唱，一夜的新歌彌漫到全城。」（以上第十六十七面）</p>
<p>一面介紹「雅典城美國學院」（第四篇），一面作者無限感慨地說：「歐美各大國家都在雅典設立有古典學院，我們從談不到這種設備，也應該有人去念一點活書回來。我們如今正需要　這樣念一點活書，這方法是可貴的。」（第二十三面）大約希臘的天氣給作者的印象實在太深了，他重複讚美之外，更強調着說：「我敢說哪兒的天氣都沒有希臘的好。」（第二十三面）那恐怕我們的昆明也望塵莫及。</p>
<p>在離開希臘之後，直奔羅馬之前，作者抽空進了古色古香的西西裏島，記下了「遊程」，那不過是存真實錄罷了。</p>
<p>「焦大」（第六篇）記一位流落在希臘不知道八年還是十八年的同胞，大沽口人，多少年前在一隻荷蘭船上當水手，因為醉了，在君士坦丁堡趕掉了船才流落到希臘的：作者見義勇為，努力設法他回到祖國。並且希望他「回到大沽口做一個漁長，永度着那飄泊的生涯；要不然，就留在上海做一個英雄•」（第三十六面）篇名「焦大」絕對引起一種錯誤的聯想，教人不能不記得一針見血地常識賈府大門前那一對石獅子乾淨的老牌焦大。</p>
<p>以上六篇都是作者追記那在希臘留戀忘返的一年印象，在這次大戰之前寫的；在戰爭中，他更寫下了一些希臘抗戰史話，搜在這本册子裡的一共八篇：「馬拉松之役」，「御前會議」，「死守溫泉關」，「薩拉密斯海戰」，「亞歷山大行軍記」，「象戰」，「亞歷山大受傷記」，「亞歷山大之死」——都是最上乘的愛國故事，沒有一篇不可歌可泣！</p>
<p>顯然，在最後三篇文字裏，「怎樣研究希臘文學」，「希臘悲劇的特點」，「希臘雕刻」，作者所希望於青年讀者的決不止道聽塗說的一鱗半爪關於希臘古國的智識，而是進一步的認識。而筆者所希望却是：趕快讀「希臘漫話」，讀完之後，不妨乘興讀盡我們的作者花多少心血而成功的譯作：「波斯人」，「普羅密修斯」，「窩狄浦斯王」，「依斐格納亞」，「美狄亞，」「特羅亞婦女」，（以上希臘悲劇），「雲」（以上希臘戲劇）全部都是商務出版的。</p>
<p>此外，我們的作者還有一部新詩集「龍涎」（上海時代公司戰前出版），也是值得注意的，特別是他在當時那樣大家敢怒而不敢言的環境裏，大膽而露骨地如數家珍一般儘量運用希臘神話而發揮「抗日」的思想和感情。總而言之，除了最近的「芙蓉城」，我們的作者所產生的創作，譯作，述作，是完全打成一片的，而且古希臘賞賜給他的靈感始終在活躍着，可喜也可敬。</p>

<p>批評者那樣缺少謙虛的態度，簡直是一件神奇的事情。——赫爾普</p>
<h3>歐美作家的稿費</h3>
<p>— 華美</p>
<p>在歐美各國，如果成功了一個有名的作家，就可以得到很大的報酬，最近一個美國的出版家，付了崔爾根（Hall　Caine）六萬金磅作為他「基督的一生」一書的稿費，雖然他及不上前英國首相勞合喬治（Leoyd　George）的一本書便可得稿費十萬磅，但已經是一個可觀的數目了。</p>
<p>有許多作家，以為寫文章本來是一種沒本錢的生意，所以稿費的多少是在所不論的。諧如女作家奧斯汀（Jane　Austin）做了一本Sense&amp;Sesibility祇拿了一百五十鎊的稿費，霍姆（Fergus　Hume）做了一本Mys-tery　of　A　Hansom　Cab,書店主人許了他五十鎊，他就把版權賣去，結果這一本書竟銷了五十萬本，他於是衹好對牠看着而己，再要想懊悔也來不及了。</p>
<p>但金錢上的酬報，並不足以影響作者在文壇上的聲譽與地位，以莎士比亞來說，他全年的收入祇有三十金鎊，而現代劇作家諾爾考華德却有五萬鎊之多，同樣的，在於作曲家也是如此，十九世紀的名作曲家馬拉脫（Molart）受倔於普魯士王，年俸四五十鎊，而二十世紀的曼諾亭（Ve-hudi　Menuhin）好萊的米高梅公司出了他十萬鎊一年，他還是不肯去。</p>
<p>當然各個時代的情形是大有不同的，馬拉脫又是一個實事求是的人，他曾說：「我一年中所產生的不值八十鎊，但事實上我還可能產生超過八十鎊代價的作品。」又如麥考萊寫了一部英國歷史，費整整五年的光陰，得到了二萬金鎊的報酬，後來威爾斯（H.　G.Wells）也寫了一部英國歷史却得了七萬金鎊的報酬。</p>
<p>也有許多人每年得有很可觀的稿費，但仍舊是負着債，而這種債務又靠着版稅來清償，例如葉萊斯（　　Wallace）在臨死時猶負着十萬鎊的債，但不幾年，早已獲得清債了，他的子孫還能繼續靠着他們祖父的豐富的版稅過活，而且很維持了相當的時候。</p>
<p>大部份的作家，在成名之前，往往都是非常貧苦的，收入也少，如却爾斯狄根斯（Charles　Dickens）每個月做了Pickwick的一章，售二十金鎊，但在他去世之前，他本書已值三萬鎊了，做萬立佛遊記的那位需奈何遜史惠夫脫得到了僅僅二百鎊的稿費，但那是他第一篇的長篇處女作。而且第一次從寫文章得到稿費。史惠夫脫一生的不幸的境遇可想而知。</p>
<p>名詩人開普賢靈（Kipling）每一首詩可得稿費一百鎊，柯南道爾（Coman　Doyle）的福爾摩斯探案共得稿費七千金鎊。勞·華萊斯從賓漢一書獲得四萬金鎊，可各脫爵士（Lord　Walter　Scott)寫作五年共獲稿費二十萬金鎊。</p>
<p>俄（Victor　Hugo）寫作一生共得十六萬鎊的稿費。</p>
<p>以上所說的，當然都是比較有名的作家，普通的作家，一本費二年工夫寫成的書能得到一千金鎊的稿費已經算是很幸運的了。一篇處女作大概可售三十金鎊，歷史或傳記，可售一百金鎊，但是要使出版家採用，也是一樁很不容易的事，除非他的文章所描寫的內容是具有特殊歷史價值的，或是竟是影射一種官場秘密的，出版家才敢放膽採用。</p>
<p>我們看了歐美作家的待遇，再來回過頭來看看中國作家的待遇，便覺得真是天差地遠了。</p>
<p>追究其原因，大概是因為中國的文盲太多，出版物的銷路不大有把握，所以書店老闆不敢放膽出大價錢盡量收買文藝作品，於是靠賣文文偽活的作家們倒霉了，在歐美就沒有這種現象，他們的教育普及，文化發展得快，人民的購買力又大，所以歐美作家的生活較之中國作家自要較勝多多了。但願十年後的中國，一切都能重行趕上歐美，在我們賢明的蔣主席領導之下我們來開始展開一個新的文化生活不達目的不休！到了那時我再來寫一篇「中國作家之稿費」，以　今日「長他人志氣，減自己威風」之　。再會吧！中國作家之窮，我們要趕走你。</p>

<h3>Ten Major Crimes of Endangering the Nation and Harming the People: The Conclusion of the Trial and Interrogation of the Traitor Chen Gongbo; Sentencing at 4 PM on the 12th</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Suzhou, 5th, 9 PM] Chen Gongbo, the number one great traitor of the Republic of China, has been prosecuted by Chief Prosecutor Han Tao of the Jiangsu High Court after the conclusion of the investigation, based on ten major crimes, and a public trial was held in the First Criminal Court this afternoon at 2:30 PM. By 12 noon, the audience seats in the Criminal Court were already full of spectators. At 2 PM, the bailiffs were ordered to bring the traitor Chen from the detention center on Siqian Street. At 2:30 PM, Judge Sun Honglin, Chief Prosecutor Han Tao, along with associate judges Shi Meiyu and Lu Jiarui, and clerk Cai Yiting, etc., arrived in court, and the appointed defense lawyer Gao Rong also arrived. After the presiding judge and others took their seats, they ordered the bailiffs to bring the traitor Chen to the court and stand in the defendant's dock. First, the presiding judge asked the defendant's name, age, origin, and address. Then, Chief Han stood up and read the indictment, explaining the intention of the prosecution. Then, Judge Sun ordered the traitor Chen to defend himself. The trial lasted until 8:30 PM, a total of six hours. The court immediately announced that the sentencing would be held at 2 PM on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Recites Eight Years of Memoirs with a Calm Demeanor</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Suzhou, 5th, 9:05 PM] From this morning, newspaper reporters have been constantly entering and leaving the High Court. By a little after 1 PM, the seats were full. At 2:35 PM, the bailiff shouted "Court is in session!" Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, President of the High Court, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Chen Jiarui, etc., took their seats amidst the attention of thousands. The traitor Chen appeared calm and stated: Age 55, native of Nanfu, Guangdong, residing at No. 64 Beiping Road, Nanjing. In the third year of Guangxu, joined the Xingzhonghui and then joined the Kuomintang. Asked: How much property? Answer: The house is rented; please investigate the property. Chief Prosecutor Han Tao then stood up and announced the intent of the prosecution, roughly stating: The defendant held important positions in the Party and government, but actually sided with the traitor Wang, leaving Rong and flying to Hanoi. Chen also went to Hong Kong, where he published the scandalous telegram, and then joined the puppet organization, holding important positions. He even went to Japan as a special envoy to express gratitude, showing no shame. The major deeds of endangering the country are ten in number: (1) Concluding secret treaties that humiliated the country, (2) Aiding the enemy, (3) Issuing counterfeit currency, (4) Participating in the anti-British and American war, (5) Drafting young men, (6) Publicly selling opium, (7) Implementing traitorous education, (8) Using the pretext of "cleansing the countryside" to harm patriots, (9) Embezzlement, (10) Recruiting puppet troops, endangering the nation and harming the people, truly committing the crimes stipulated in Articles 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 13 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The presiding judge then ordered Chen to answer briefly. Chen then read from his confession, "Memoirs of the Past Eight Years," stating:</p>
<p>(1) Several years of hard work must be spoken of. During the January 28th Incident, he advocated resistance and demanded that Zhang Xueliang resign along with him because Zhang Xueliang refused to resist. When the Battle of Gubeikou broke out, Zhu specially returned to the country to face the national crisis together. However, according to reports from the soldiers, the firepower was too poor, resulting in huge losses. Wang actually knew nothing about the Tanggu Agreement, and did not defend himself even when attacked. (2) In the 23rd year, the country had gradually split into two factions, and villains were further provoking them. Wang's family all advised Wang to resign from the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Chen also advised him. Wang was in great pain and only said: "Which wise man would be willing to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs?" However, because the strength of the war was too different, wanting to preserve the nation's vitality and fearing that the Communist Party would reap the benefits, he advocated peace. (3) Chen himself opposed the peace movement in , believing that whether peace or war, the entire country should be united, and also mistakenly believed that the Japanese were sincere in negotiating peace. However, Wang did not want the common people to die with them. If Chen himself stayed in the mainland, he would be even more suspected, and he wanted to dissuade from going to Japan, but refused to allow it. Later, Wang's return to the capital was all prepared, and Chen knew that the matter was hopeless. (3) He opposed the puppet Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and did not participate in the discussion, as he had told Abe Shigemitsu and others that he opposed it. He also opposed the special administration of North China, promoted the Three Principles of the People, and promoted clean politics. The Japanese, because they felt that Nanjing still had hostility, called those who were waiting for peace and resistance. (4) After Wang's death, if the Ning organization was immediately disbanded, he feared that no one would be responsible and there would be great chaos. However, he had sent a telegram expressing his feelings and emphasized that the Party should not be divided and the country must be unified. (5) After the Japanese surrender, he tried to avoid the Japanese army from trampling on the local area or colluding with the Communist army, and tried to maintain security. However, because the situation of the military school's Kondo Division and the navy was unstable, Ren Yuandao repeatedly urged him to avoid it. Later, he flew to Japan, leaving a long letter to Chairman , stating that as soon as he received the order, he would immediately come to Nanjing to await punishment. (6) The Beijing organization ultimately preserved the nation's vitality, and Japanese newspapers also said that the people in the occupied areas hated Japan and felt that the world was still in the tribal era, and should pay attention to military preparations, eliminate illiteracy, and engage in technology, and should never only seek pleasure. At this point, there was a half-hour break.</p>
<p>Answers to the Indictment: (1) He always opposed the Basic Relations Treaty and made this clear to Honda Shigemitsu. When the alliance treaty was later signed, the provisions for stationing troops in North China were cancelled, and he told the envoy Koiso that true peace could only be achieved if the statement recognizing Manchukuo was revoked. (2) Nanjing had tried its best to obtain materials and maintain national strength, hence the saying that peaceful resistance was better than resistance. (3) The Legislative Yuan was not responsible for the decisions of the Central Political Committee; the issuance of Central Reserve Certificates was to resist Japanese military scrip. (4) Nanjing's participation in the war was to take the opportunity to absorb resources, and he advocated that our country mediate the Japanese war against foreign countries. (5) He denied drafting young men, referring to it as recruitment. (6) The opium trade was because the Japanese wanted to obtain secret funds. Although he was the Director-General of Opium Suppression, Yuan Yuquan was actually responsible. (7) The compilation of puppet textbooks was during the Reorganized National Government period. After Wang came, the national flag was changed and the Three Principles of the People were publicly promoted. (8) Cleansing the countryside was intended to reduce the suffering of the countryside. He did not deny his responsibility, but he did not want to take the blame for others. (9) He deeply hated the atmosphere of corruption, which could not be changed in a short time. (10) He never persuaded people from Chongqing to join the puppet government, and transferred Sun Liangcheng to northern Jiangsu to serve as a barrier to the southeast, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Communists.</p>
<p>Defending Wang: Wang had sought peace, and he did not agree with Wang's advice, but he sympathized with Wang's hardships. He had completed the road to unification, so that the Northeast would not be ravaged. The traitor Chen then requested that his confession be published.</p>
<p>Asked: If you did not agree with the peace movement, why did you leave Sichuan? And why did you transfer from Hong Kong to Shanghai? Answer: It was based on the righteousness of revolutionary comrades and to remedy Wang's mistakes. Asked: Did you know that forming a government was against the law? Answer: In legal terms, it was against the law, but in political terms, he really wanted to send this agreement to Chongqing and have Chiang agree to it later. Asked: Did you know that it would affect the future of the war of resistance? Answer: He opposed Wang's actions and sympathized with Wang's feelings. Asked: What did you do in Japan? Answer: The first time was to return the courtesy and question the unreasonableness of the Basic Treaty. The second time was to seek to sign an alliance treaty. Asked: Since you opposed recognizing Manchukuo, did you ensure that this article was cancelled? Answer: It is being discussed and revised. (Continued on page 2)</p>
<p>Small Scenes in the Court</p>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Urgent Telegram from Suzhou, 5th, 10:08 PM] Today, when the traitor Chen was escorted from prison, it was originally planned to use a chartered car, but the driver refused to work for the great traitor, so a horse-drawn carriage was used instead.</p>
<p>Wherever the traitor Chen passed, the streets were crowded with people, all wanting to see the face of the great traitor. Many people occupied the windows of buildings along the street to watch from above. The court session opened at 2:30 PM, and people had already gone to the High Court at 10 AM to occupy the seats in the audience. When the reporter arrived at 12 PM, most of the seats were already taken. By 1 PM, it was already full, and those who came later had to stand.</p>
<p>Before the trial, Secretary-General Yang, both old and young, was running back and forth, quite busy. At 2 PM, Secretary-General Yang announced: (1) Examination of the emperor's hearing certificate is required, (2) Smoking is not allowed, (3) Do not run around, (4) No strange noises, (5) Please sit upright to maintain order in the court.</p>
<p>By the time the trial was scheduled to begin, the group of reporters had arrived and were waiting quietly. There were four female reporters, sitting in a corner, and next to them were several major generals, who seemed to be quite familiar, talking and laughing, quite like heroes and beauties. There were many women in the audience, but most of them left halfway after the court session began at 4 PM.</p>
<p>Today, there was only one foreign female guest who came to listen to the trial, but it was already late, and there were no seats, which was quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>At 2:25 PM, the traitor Chen was escorted by four armed bailiffs and walked into the gate of the court. Because the time had not yet arrived, he first walked into the fifth waiting room. At exactly 2:30 PM, it was announced that the court session was open, and everyone stood up. The judge, the judge, the prosecutor, and the clerk walked out of the side door in a file and sat in the main hall. Then, the traitor Chen was also escorted from the fifth waiting room to the court.</p>
<p>Chen was wearing a serge robe and a monk's hat. When he approached the judge, he took off his hat, held the file in his hand, walked slowly into the court, stood in the defendant's column, and looked quite natural.</p>
<p>First, the judge asked about his age and origin. When asked if he had any property, the traitor Chen made a strong smile and replied: This is hard to say, please investigate.</p>
<p>Then, the chief prosecutor narrated the ten major crimes of the traitor Chen, which lasted 37 minutes. When he mentioned the puppet government's cleansing of the countryside, which harmed northern Jiangsu, he particularly emphasized his tone, as he was a native of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>During the trial, every time Chen made a move, the sound of the camera followed. The photographers also used the light of the strong lights to capture the scene.</p>
<p>The photographers squatted, or bent over, or leaned on the ground, showing various wonderful scenes.</p>
<p>When the traitor Chen read his confession, when he read to Chairman Chiang, he called him Mr. Chiang, and the judge corrected him and changed it to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen's confession was one inch thick, with more than 60,000 small characters, and more than 30 pages.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen spoke Mandarin, interspersed with Cantonese.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen's eyesight was not good, and he often put on his glasses temporarily to look at the evidence presented by the court, and then took off his glasses again after finishing, moving them up and down, quite busy.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen used to call himself chairman, but today he is facing the court, I wonder what he is thinking.</p>
<p>A gramophone was placed in the court and a record was played as corroborating evidence, creating a precedent for trial records.</p>
<p>When the traitor Chen finished reading his confession, he finally said that in the current situation, he could be tried in any way, and he could be sentenced in any way.</p>
<p>The traitor Chen requested twice that the court publish his defense, and the judge replied that this was a matter for the court and was under consideration.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Changchun Retreat in Large Numbers; Our Military Delegation Bids Farewell to Soviet Generals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Soviet troops have been withdrawing from here in large numbers in recent days. It is estimated that as of the morning of the 5th, there were only 3,000 people left in the city. Yesterday afternoon, reporters saw more than ten light and heavy tanks heading to the station. This was the last batch of Soviet military tanks to withdraw. Although the defense of the city is still nominally the responsibility of the Soviet army, our security forces have begun to assume actual responsibility. The Soviet side no longer interferes with the actions of our security forces. The Soviet City Defense Command hinted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday that one Soviet military unit would withdraw on the afternoon of the 7th.

<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 5th] A unit of the Communist army suddenly advanced from the Hanjia Tiaozi area to Sankeshu on the evening of the 3rd, and entered the intersections of Taiping District in the city on the morning of the 4th. The police were driven away, and the atmosphere in the city suddenly became tense. It is rumored that the Communist army has also appeared near Nandao Street outside the city, echoing from inside and outside, causing great panic among the people. All shops closed their doors and closed down around 3:30 PM.</p>

The government representative cannot decide because he has not received orders, so the road repair work has stalled again. On the Ping-Sui Qian line, the Communist Party plans to repair the section between Huailai and Qinglongqiao first, and the section between Yanggao and Zhoushizhuang in the next step. Chen Luhua, the 3rd section chief of the Executive Headquarters who went to Gaomi on the Jiaoji line a few days ago to resolve the road repair problem, returned to Beiping from Jinan today.

<h3>Marshall Will Return to China Next Week to Find a Solution to the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Authoritative sources said today that General Marshall was deeply disturbed by the news of the escalating conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in the Northeast, and was eager to repeat his mission to mediate peace in China. He is expected to leave the United States for Chongqing within the next week. It was also said that Marshall and the State Department believed that he should return quickly to prevent the deterioration of relations between the Nationalists and Communists, but Marshall was still very optimistic about the ultimate success of his mission. He believed that most of the recent mutual accusations between the Nationalists and Communists over the Northeast issue were aimed at gaining bargaining power, rather than an indication of an expanding rift. The source also said that Marshall believed that it was necessary to return to China as soon as possible after hearing that China would improve relations on its own without the active intervention of American officials. Marshall and other American officials in China believe that it is impossible to act only as advisors and mediators, and that they must actively lead in order to make any progress. Officials here are deeply concerned about the Northeast problem, mostly because they still lack accurate information about the political, economic and military situation in the Northeast. They said that Marshall will be able to find a solution to the various problems in the Northeast after returning to China. Marshall has made "some progress" in his mission, which allowed him to return to the United States for a trip during the Nationalist-Communist negotiations. Marshall believes that the greatest threat to his efforts is famine, which has already occurred in central China. He is working hard here to obtain surplus ships to transport food to the Yangtze River, and at the same time, inland river sailors are being recruited in the Philippines, Japan and other places. Authoritative sources have learned that Marshall believes that General Zhou Enlai is a shrewd and experienced bargainer, but he is actually a very sound person, and Marshall hopes to achieve a final solution through this. He believes that after returning to China and holding talks with Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai, and stepping up efforts to implement the agreement at the lower level, most of the problems can be solved easily.</p>

<h3>Control Council for Japan Convenes; MacArthur Delivers Important Speech: Threat of Power Inevitably Causes Suspicion and Hatred; Determination to Continue Occupation Policy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] In his opening address to the first meeting of the Control Council for Japan, comprised of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, MacArthur today advocated that all countries in the world should take Japan's new constitution as a model and unanimously abolish the use of war as an instrument of national sovereignty. MacArthur was seated with representatives from the United States and Britain to his left, and with representatives from China and the Soviet Union to his right. MacArthur also denounced the threat of power, border incursions, secret maneuvers, and disregard for public morality, which inevitably lead to suspicion and hatred. MacArthur openly stated that the mission of the council was only advisory in nature and that he intended to continue to pursue his occupation policy to avoid oppression or arbitrary actions, and to instill in the minds of the Japanese the principles of freedom and rights that they had never known. A large portion of MacArthur's opening speech was about the abolition of war, and a smaller portion addressed the occupation policy and answered outside criticisms. MacArthur also stated that since the Council was advisory in nature, it did not share the significant administrative responsibilities of the United Nations, which was the sole executive authority in Japan. However, he hoped that the Council would be a valuable element in the solution of many future problems, and that the management of Japan would continue to be carried out by the existing government structure. The soundness of this policy could be clearly demonstrated by the progress of the occupation. MacArthur, wearing a winter military uniform and a five-star insignia, attended the meeting at 10:00 AM and delivered his speech for a total of twenty-five minutes in a clear and firm tone. He concluded by urging all representatives to solidify the peace that had been achieved through great sacrifice. MacArthur left the meeting shortly after delivering his speech.</p>
<p>MacArthur's headquarters announced today that Major General Marquat, the chief of the Economic and Scientific Section, would be MacArthur's representative to the Four-Power Control Council for Japan. Colonel Fellers, the military advisor, would be the secretary-general of the Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] British representative Ball and Soviet representative Derevyanko declined to immediately comment on MacArthur's opening remarks. Chinese representative Lieutenant General Chu Shih-ming said that he was deeply moved, but declined to comment on any specific issue. The Council will meet at least once every two weeks, with the meeting date set for Wednesday. These meetings will be informal meetings.</p>
<p>Various Meetings Will Be Open</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] After MacArthur's opening address, the Four-Power Control Council for Japan discussed organizational matters. Soviet representative Derevyanko proposed that all meetings of the Council should be held in secret, with no reporters allowed to attend. Only communiqués would be issued by the Council from time to time. US representative Marquat proposed that all major meetings should be open, while informal meetings could be subject to reasonable restrictions. After ten minutes of discussion, all representatives agreed to Marquat's proposal. British representative Ball and Chinese representative Chu Shih-ming both supported Marquat. The representatives then discussed the responsibilities of the secretary.</p>
<p>During today's discussion of the meeting procedures, the Soviet representative proposed that if a majority of the members of the Japanese parliament elected in the April 10th election were deemed unsuitable, new elections should be held. He also proposed that MacArthur should send a copy of any directive issued to the Japanese government to the Council representatives at least seven days in advance. If a proclamation was issued, the Japanese government should send a copy to the Council at least ten days before the proclamation was made. The Soviet representative also requested that the Council secretariat should be internationalized. This issue will be raised for discussion at the second meeting on April 10th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] The representatives of China, the Soviet Union, and Britain on the Four-Power Control Council for Japan stated today that they would present important proposals at the Council meeting on April 17th, but declined to disclose their nature.</p>

US representative Byrnes ranked second with 5,000 words, followed by representatives from Britain, Australia, and Poland.

<p>Personnel Dispatched to Unseal Moldy Materials</p>
<p>The 57th Division of the garrison here, which was ordered to guard more than one hundred enemy and puppet warehouses, had long sealed them. All materials had reached a state where "wheat sprouts and noodles turned into cakes" and were unbearable. Numerous telegrams were sent to the military headquarters requesting personnel to be dispatched to handle the matter quickly. Director Dong had also traveled to Nanjing several times to request instructions on how to handle the situation. According to Director Dong, the Headquarters of the Army has approved the handling of enemy and puppet warehouses. The Ministry of Military Administration, the Supervision Department, and the Enemy and Puppet Materials Handling Bureau have dispatched personnel to Zhenjiang, and the warehouses will be unsealed within days. Materials that can be used by the local government will be supplied as much as possible. Materials stored in the enemy and puppet warehouses in Yangzhou will also be handled by Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Dragon Lantern Festival Leads to Fatal Shooting</p>
<p>In the near countryside of Ye Xie, farmers used the spring gap to make and race dragon lanterns. On the third day, at dusk, the dragon lanterns from each village gathered in Ye Xie to compete. The spectators were crowded and the road was blocked. When the lanterns arrived at the Guandi Temple in the town, farmers from each village jumped onto the stage to watch. The temple originally had a police substation. A policeman carrying a gun went on stage to stop them, but failed and used the butt of his gun to injure a villager. This aroused public anger, and they rushed forward. The policeman retreated to a long-standing place. The crowd chased after him relentlessly. The chief of police was unable to disperse the crowd and fired a shot (one version says he fired into the air) as a warning. One person in the crowd was hit in a vital spot and died immediately. Four others were seriously injured. The spectators scattered and fled, and the dragon lanterns returned to their villages. Director Zhang of the police substation went to the county bureau at noon on the fourth to report the incident and was ordered to remain at the bureau pending investigation.</p>

<h3>The Trial of Traitor Chen Gongbo (Continued from First Page)</h3>
<p>Question: Were the members of the puppet Central Political Conference all members of the Kuomintang? Answer: Most of them were, and some were members of the Youth Party, the State Socialist Party, and non-partisans. Question: Among the resolutions of the third meeting, were there resolutions that "Chongqing decrees are all invalid," "all internal and external measures are invalid," "the military is to cease duties and await orders," and "all civil servants are to report to Nanjing"? Answer: Although the resolution was like this, all subsequent government orders were not handled in accordance with it. Question: Did you not recognize the central government? Answer: The situation was very complicated (American accent). Question: Did the Outline for the Establishment of the Puppet Government stipulate a comprehensive peace treaty between China and Japan, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and economic cooperation with Japan? Answer: Yes, but comprehensive peace was when Wang and others explored peace and hoped that Chongqing would agree. Question: Did you participate in the recognition of Manchukuo? Answer: I fundamentally opposed it, and therefore opposed the Basic Treaty. Question: On February 26, 1935, the third anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, did you broadcast a speech in your capacity as the president of the Executive Yuan, advocating cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo? Answer: I don't remember clearly. Question; Is there a recording of your own voice? Answer: I don't remember clearly. At that time, the court played the recording twice. Question: Is that you speaking? Answer: I am not clear myself. The court played it again. Chen said the voice was similar, but he could not be sure, and this was nothing more than a formality. Question: During the period when you served as the acting puppet chairman, were the orders signed by you? Answer: Yes. Question: When Chu was the governor of Guangdong Province, there was an exchange of telegrams about the distribution of opium, saying that the quantity of soil was very small and that the puppet Manchukuo could not deliver it on schedule. Answer: Yuan Yuqian was responsible, and I only signed my name because I was nominally the Superintendent of Opium Suppression. At this point, Chen said that the case was extremely complicated but also extremely simple, and asked the court to render a verdict as it pleased, and he would not say a word of injustice nor would he appeal. The court announced that the investigation of evidence was complete. The prosecutor argued: (1) The cancellation of extraterritoriality in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the recovery of concessions, etc., and the recognition of the puppet state of Manchuria, were visible in the defendant's own broadcast after Britain and the United States canceled them first. (2) The puppet government should think of the people, so why did it send out so many control societies? (3) The puppet currency's resistance to the Japanese military scrip was credible and all Japanese proposals, destroying our country's finances. (4) Without the assistance of Britain and the United States, our country would have perished, and he knew that the central government would win, so he only did a little work to seek exoneration. (5) The conscription of able-bodied men was indeed a fact. (6) The public sale of opium was extremely evident in the telegram Chen sent to Chu on July 30, 1935. (7) The "Qingxiang" harmed the people the most; the Qingxiang also cleared out the bottom of the boxes. (8) This court investigated one thousand several hundred traitors, and evidence of bribery and public funds can be found everywhere. (9) The harassment of the puppet army was also all commissioned by the defendant. According to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, Chen should be responsible. (10) Wang's leadership desire was too great, so his behavior was even worse than Qin Hui's, and Chen had repeatedly advised but did not listen, so why didn't he leave, and instead became the president, and acted for him three times." Chen replied that the prosecutor spoke from the perspective of the essence of the Spring and Autumn Annals, and he dared not consider himself of such quality. However, he was responsible for all the affairs that Wang obtained, and he would not utter a word of injustice after the verdict. He then responded to the ten points, slightly defending himself, especially regarding the Qingxiang point, saying that this matter ended in August 1933 because he opposed it and it was canceled. He said that he had harmed underground work comrades and could only say the words "great lord, injustice." All the underground workers he knew and could help, he bailed out. Lower-level personnel acted recklessly in violation of orders, and he could not be responsible. If the court insisted on holding him accountable in accordance with the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Annals, then he was also willing to accept it, but if a clerk in the Jiangsu Provincial Government committed a crime, should the chairman of the province also be responsible? At that time, the public defender Gao Rongqi stood up to defend him, especially pointing out that Chen had established two radio stations, one for underground workers and one for Dai Li's use, which meant that he had made contributions to the War of Resistance and asked for leniency. The presiding judge then announced the end of the debate and set the verdict for 4:00 PM on the 12th. It was 8:30 PM when the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Peaceful Discussion on the Capital Issue</h3>
<p>The issue of the national capital is evident in the resolutions passed by this session of the Participatory Political Council. During the general session of this Council, Councilors Ping Deheng and others proposed a motion requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital. The motion was passed by the general session and submitted to the government for consideration and implementation. The passage of this motion, recorded in official documents, indicates that the issue of the national capital is of concern to the people of the nation. Prior to this, in the past two or three years, people in Chongqing and other places have also had heated discussions on the so-called capital issue, with some advocating for the capital to be in Beiping, others for moving west to Xi'an, and still others suggesting building the capital in Jinan or Changchun. All of the above were originally personal opinions and did not necessarily require much attention. However, the motion recently passed by the Participatory Political Council is no longer the personal opinion of one or two individuals, but represents the opinion of the entire Council; and the so-called Participatory Political Council is said to be representative of public opinion. Now that the Council has passed a motion requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital, the government certainly has its own considerations as to whether to adopt it. However, because this motion has been proposed and passed, we cannot deny the existence of this issue, and therefore we must also discuss this so-called capital issue.</p>
<p>Originally, the national capital should be a non-issue. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China was established in Nanjing. Later, when Yuan Shikai came to power and moved the capital to the north, the progress of the National Revolution was hindered and could not be fully implemented. The Chinese Nationalist Party completed the National Revolution, established its government in Guangzhou, launched the Northern Expedition, and after capturing Nanjing, designated it as the capital. From the historical viewpoint of the Chinese national liberation movement, Nanjing should be the national capital of our country, and there is no question about it. Those who now question the establishment of the capital in Nanjing do so perhaps because they believe that its location is close to Shanghai, and Shanghai is a den of vice. The close proximity of the capital to Shanghai makes it easy for Shanghai's bad habits to spread to Nanjing, forming the so-called collusion between officials and merchants, leading to a gradual decline in political integrity. Or, they may be based on national defense considerations, believing that its location is along the river and near the sea. Based on the experience in this war of resistance, they believe that the location is not safe and should be moved elsewhere. Or, they may start from a historical perspective, believing that establishing the capital in Nanjing is only a temporary arrangement, insufficient to build a grand nation for permanent prosperity. Or, they may be based on geographical considerations, believing that its location is biased towards the southeast and not the heart of the country. In addition, there are those who, from a psychological point of view, believe that its location, being biased towards the east and south, may lead to negligence in governing the border regions. All of the above opinions, although seemingly insightful, are difficult to sustain upon closer examination.</p>
<p>The decline in political integrity is not a matter of location but of people. If we do not consider the issue from the perspective of people and instead focus on the choice of location, believing that moving the capital will be a good solution, there will be no good results, and there is no need to say more. Therefore, the key to changing the increasingly corrupt political climate is not in moving the capital but in choosing the right people. As for the national defense point of view, in today's warfare, it is the age of atomic bombs, long-range air raids, and long-range rocket artillery, and no place has an absolute sense of security. The key to strengthening national defense is not in moving the capital, but in the determination and hard work of our entire nation. Furthermore, although this war of resistance came from the ocean in the east, who can guarantee that the next war will not come from the northwest sky? Nanjing is at the crossroads of the north and south oceans, and from a national defense point of view, it is still an important town. If we take a rigid historical view, believing that establishing the capital in Nanjing is only a temporary arrangement, insufficient to build a grand nation for permanent prosperity, this is really a historical superstition that is seemingly correct but actually wrong, and it is insufficient to discuss in today's era of scientific advancement into the realm of atomic energy. The geographical center and the national capital are two different things; the national capital is often not located in the geographical center of a country. The Soviet Union's territory stretches from the far east of the North Pacific, facing America's Alaska across the sea, to the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea in Europe, while its capital, Moscow, is located in the western part of the European continent. The capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., is located on the Atlantic coast and not in its geographical heartland. London in England, is it not also located in the southeast of the British Isles? Based on the above examples, it can be seen that the location of the national capital has nothing to do with the geographical center. As for the consolidation of border administration, that is entirely a matter of people, a matter of determination, and not a matter of location. The capital of the United States is in Washington, D.C., on the Atlantic coast, while its operations extend to the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands across the Pacific Ocean. The capital of the Soviet Union is in Moscow on the European continent, while its border operations extend to the eastern end of Siberia, facing North America's Alaska across the Bering Strait. This proves that the operation of the border is one thing, and the location of the national capital is another, and the two are not directly related.</p>
<p>We have not been able to read the full text of the motion passed by this session of the Participatory Political Council requesting the government to explicitly designate Beiping as the national capital, and we cannot deduce the reasons for it. We can generally guess that it is nothing more than that Beiping is close to Liaoning and Shenyang, so that governing the Northeast and even the border regions will not be a case of being too far away to be effective and unable to hear and see everything. Moreover, its location was originally the capital, and there are many official residences and houses that can be used. In addition, there may be some historical and geographical superstitionists who believe that building the capital in Beiping can control the entire country, which is not as biased towards the southeast as Nanjing. We believe that these are not strong reasons for establishing the capital in Beiping. The establishment of the capital in Nanjing is deeply historically linked to the National Revolution in China, and it is also the location of the mausoleum of the founding father of the nation. The setbacks of the past National Revolution were partly due to the move of the capital to the north and the expansion of Yuan Shikai and other warlord feudal forces. Now, as the country celebrates the victory of the War of Resistance, it should actively launch the great cause of nation-building in Nanjing, the location of the capital when the full-scale war of resistance was launched, and establish a grand model for the country for all time. Although the Participatory Political Council has passed this motion, we feel that it is best not to make too many changes. Nanjing's status as the national capital of our country is similar to that of Washington, D.C., as the national capital of the United States. We must cherish the position that Nanjing occupies in the Chinese national liberation movement!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the change of the national capital represents political turmoil and instability. Today, the capital can be moved to Beiping, but who knows if tomorrow it can be moved from Beiping to Lanzhou, to Wuhan, or even to Guangzhou in Lingnan? All of these are signs of an unhealthy national life. Now that the country is after a long period of war, it must achieve stability in the midst of turmoil. With the progress of the National Revolution, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, it has also actively devoted itself to the construction of the capital, and at that time, there was no dissent regarding the construction of the capital. The victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the capital to Nanjing is a natural thing; however, the Participatory Political Council has now passed this motion to evade the capital at this time, which is also a sign of the people losing confidence. The location of the national capital is one thing for personal preferences, and another thing for the great plans of the nation and the people. We still feel that establishing the capital in Nanjing is a non-issue. We want to build Nanjing, just like the Americans built Washington, D.C., and the Turks built Ankara.</p>
<h3>Many British Civil Servants</h3>
<p>The Whole Country Will Be Civil Servants in Fifty Years</p>
<p>[Reuter, London, 5th] Lord Balfour told the House of Lords yesterday that with Britain's population gradually decreasing and state-run programs gradually advancing, it is expected that by the year 2000, every citizen will be a civil servant. In 1914, there were 250,000 British civil servants, which increased to 320,000 in 1930, and to 716,000 last year. Currently, there are 691,000. It is expected that after all state-run programs are fully implemented, one in four people in the country will be directly employed by the state.</p>
<h3>Italian Miss Deceived and Commits Murder, Shooting and Killing a British Officer, Cries Loudly and Reads Love Letters in Court</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 4th] Miss Scelery, a promoter of Italian women's rights, met British Army Captain Rysch. Later, after discovering that she had been deceived by Rysch, she shot and killed him in his office in Rome last October 10. The Rome court opened the trial today, and the audience was extremely crowded, with Miss Scelery being regarded as a heroine. Before the opening, the audience seats were already packed, and up to 2,000 people were unable to enter. A love letter from Miss Scelery to Rysch was read aloud in court. At that time, Miss Scelery looked dejected and stood up slightly from the defendant's seat, crying out loudly, "Enough! Enough!" The letter was dated September 29, and it said, "Tonight I will wait for you to come, this will be the most beautiful night in our lives." According to Miss Scelery, Rysch was not only married, but also had a new love. I killed Rysch not only to clear my name and punish Rysch, but also to protect Italian women. The audience was visibly moved. The court then announced that the trial would continue on Friday morning, and several women even stepped forward to kiss Miss Scelery.</p>

<h3>Important Speech by Minister Gu - Mission to Shanghai is to Find Ways to Eliminate Labor Disputes - Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>Minister Gu Zhengwang of the Ministry of Social Affairs recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing to discuss with all parties ways to eliminate labor disputes, and also convened a meeting with worker representatives. A reporter made a special trip to interview him, and his answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What is Minister Gu's mission to Shanghai? A: Recently, the labor problem in Shanghai has been quite serious. I was instructed by President Song to come to Shanghai to observe the actual situation and, based on the "Emergency Measures to Accelerate Economic Recovery" passed by the Second Plenary Session, to discuss effective ways to eliminate labor disputes with relevant agencies. Q: What is the policy for eliminating labor disputes? A: Based on the spirit of labor-management coordination, on the one hand, we will try to resolve and protect the legitimate demands and legal interests of workers. On the other hand, we will rectify labor discipline and crack down on illegal activities in order to stabilize workers' lives and production order, and achieve the goal of accelerating economic recovery. Now, most factories only pay attention to increasing production and ignore the close relationship between production and labor welfare. Most workers only pay attention to increasing wages and do not know that wage increases should be based on the development of industry. Therefore, the elimination of labor-management disputes, fundamentally speaking, still requires both labor and management to have a full understanding of the significance of the mutual coordination of economic and social policies. Q: The "Emergency Measures to Accelerate Economic Recovery" passed by the Second Plenary Session stipulates the establishment of a labor-management arbitration committee to curb acts of slow-down and strikes. When will this arbitration committee be established in this city? A: The organization of the labor-management arbitration committee has now been agreed upon and will be established soon. The main powers of the committee are: (1) Matters related to the adjustment of general worker treatment. (2) Emergency handling of major labor-management disputes. (3) Handling of labor disputes in transportation, public utilities, and state-owned enterprises. After the establishment of the committee, it will supervise factories, mines, transportation and public utility enterprises at any time to adjust worker treatment in order to stabilize worker life and prevent disputes. When labor-management disputes occur, they should be arbitrated by the committee, and its rulings have the force of mandatory execution. Furthermore, during the recovery period, employers or workers may not suspend operations or strike or slow down work due to any labor-management disputes without going through legal procedures. If there are violations, the government may take effective measures to stop them. If this is done, it is hoped that labor disputes in this city can be gradually eliminated. Q: The Social Bureau of this city recently decided to adjust wages monthly based on the worker's cost of living index. What is Minister Gu's opinion on this? A: Determining wages based on the worker's cost of living index is quite reasonable. During the War of Resistance, the provinces in the rear did so. Recently, due to more drastic price fluctuations, the industrial and commercial enterprises in this city are adjusting wages monthly. If this can continue to be done in the future, labor-management disputes can be reduced. However, if production and business conditions are not good and the employer is indeed unable to bear the cost, it can be issued at a reduced rate based on the cost of living index after labor-management consultation or government arbitration. Q: Recently, workers have arbitrarily slowed down or gone on strike, and there have been incidents of surrounding office premises, obstructing the freedom of factory personnel, and blockading factory gates and destroying machinery. The public is quite anxious about this. How will the government handle this? A: These behaviors are all inappropriate. Recently, labor discipline has been deteriorating. The government is determined to rectify it in order to maintain the stable development of production undertakings and protect the real interests of workers. If this continues, it will not only affect production order and social order, but will also make production more depressed, increase the possibility of worker unemployment, and make it more difficult to improve worker living conditions. It is hoped that workers in all industries will truly understand this meaning and abide by labor discipline in the future. It has recently been reported that non-industry workers are instigating labor disputes and coercing strikes, which is particularly illegal and should be strictly prohibited by the government and military and police agencies. Q: Will the Ministry of Social Affairs continue to provide relief to unemployed workers in the future? A: It should continue to be done. However, now that factories are gradually resuming work, the number of unemployed workers is also decreasing. Moreover, the liaison office of the Ministry in Beijing and Shanghai has been closed in accordance with regulations. In the future, the relief work for unemployed workers will be transferred to the Social Bureau of this city to take charge of. Q: How will the workers sent to Shanghai from the rear be resettled? A: There are not many people who have come to Shanghai now. Most of these workers followed the factories to the rear during the War of Resistance and have worked hard in the rear for several years, making many contributions. The government has now decided to give these workers the opportunity to resume work with priority. Before they resume work, they will also be given the necessary relief.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Minister Gu is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing tomorrow and fly back to Chongqing from Beijing the day after tomorrow. He will fly back to Beijing from Chongqing in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>Director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau, Dr. Joseph Needham, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Dr. Joseph Needham, director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau, came to China from the United States in 1943 and has worked in the rear for three years, engaging in liaison work between China and the United Kingdom in science and technology. Today, he will leave Shanghai via Hong Kong to return to Cambridge University in the United Kingdom to work for a period of time for the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The British Information Office held a press conference for Mr. Lee at the British Consulate yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., with more than 20 reporters from various newspapers attending. First, Mr. Lai Jiasuoliya, director of the British Information Office, gave a brief introduction, and Mr. Lee then gave a speech, elaborating on the purpose and past work of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Bureau in detail.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Suggests Five Points - Resolving the Industrial Crisis - Please Consider and Adopt Them Fairly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the municipal government, the Municipal Social Bureau, and the Municipal Provisional Council regarding the crisis caused by labor disputes in various industries, putting forward five suggestions. The original text is roughly as follows: The Chamber has repeatedly received statements from various industrial trade associations, stating that the current labor disputes are turbulent and dangerous, and requesting that relevant industrial trade associations be convened to discuss effective measures. A meeting was scheduled for April to convene various industrial trade associations to elect representatives to attend a conversation meeting. On that day, those who were invited to attend included 17 associations, including the paper-making industry, woolen textile industry, finishing and dyeing industry, dyeing and weaving industry, foundry industry, and knitting industry. They separately stated the situation of surging labor disputes affecting production, including cases where workers were dissatisfied with the adjustments of workers' jobs and went on strike, cases where labor-management agreements were reached, but the union did not agree and went on strike, and cases where labor-management agreements were reached, but the labor side insisted on different opinions based on their own standards for wages and went on strike. After improving worker benefits,</p>
<p>Work Efficiency Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>According to common sense, at least their usual work efficiency should be maintained, but the result is the opposite. Most workers are lazy in their work, and production decreases daily. Taking the report of the woolen textile finishing and dyeing industry as an example, it is said that according to the industry's production records, most of them are less than one-half of the original amount. In terms of production costs, factory overhead used to account for only 20% of the total cost, and raw materials accounted for about 80%. Currently, raw materials account for only 30%, and the remaining 70% is all factory overhead, and among the factory overhead, the expenses for workers account for the majority. The demands they put forward for improving treatment even take the state-owned China Textile Corporation as a proportion, completely ignoring that each industry has its own situation, and the strength of private factories is difficult to compete with state-owned factories. Workers' treatment has increased by 6,000 times compared to before the war. Although the factories have tried their best to adjust, the agreement reached in the morning is overturned in the evening. The number of woolen textile finishing and dyeing industry firms is not large. In just over ten days, there have been four strikes, making it difficult to cope. Currently, the price of woolen cloth for foreign orders, including tariffs and water feet, is about one to three compared with the price of domestic products. In the future, after foreign goods flood in, the crisis of domestic woolen cloth is imminent. The situation of other industries is roughly the same. The workers do not understand the principle of sharing weal and woe, and make excessive demands at any time, which is regrettable. According to the statements of the industries that attended the meeting, the current operation of the factories is not profitable, but to maintain the overall situation and avoid creating a panic of mass unemployment and increasing social unrest. In the future, after foreign goods flood in, if wages continue to rise with the cost of living index, the factories will be forced to shut down, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>Losses from Slow-Downs are Greater Than Strikes</p>
<p>The current actual difficulties are extremely complex, and there are those that cannot be summarized in the four principles set by the mayor. According to the discussion results of the representatives of various industries who attended the meeting, they were summarized into five items, and the following suggestions are put forward: (A) Post-war construction is extremely difficult. If the people still want to enjoy the pre-war life, it is no longer reasonable. Therefore, multiplying the actual salary number before the war by the daily cost of living index should be the most excellent treatment. If a base salary must be set out of thin air, and the number exceeds several times the actual number at that time, wouldn't it be excessive? Therefore, in the future, the Social Bureau should handle wages with the actual payment number before the war as the base number. (B) Strikes are not allowed before legal mediation and arbitration. Military and political agencies have already issued proclamations. But in fact, the labor side never abides by them. Each time the industry asks for wage increases, it first strikes. Even more so, the workers do not recognize strikes as illegal, but implement slow-downs. They do not know that if the workers strike, the factory can close the factory gates and there will be no losses. As for slow-downs, the furnace is lit, the machines are turned on, and the factory losses are great. Therefore, the prohibition of slow-downs should be more important than strikes. The military and political authorities should be asked to reiterate the previous order prohibiting slow-downs, otherwise, they will be severely punished. As for applying for mediation, it is hoped that the Social Bureau will investigate the factory's ability to bear the burden, the normal treatment of labor, and the actual wages paid before the job in advance. The matter of finding a middle ground with just a single number in the form of bargaining should not be taken. The labor side clearly knows that the authorities adopt a compromise number, so when they propose it, they deliberately raise it, and sometimes the result obtained after mediation is actually higher than what the labor side actually hopes for.</p>
<p>Mediate Labor Disputes, Focus on Discipline</p>
<p>(C) When mediating, absolute attention should be paid to discipline, and the number of representatives from both sides must be equal. It is best to use the form of a court. Otherwise, the labor side gathers thousands or even tens of thousands of people, while the employer's representatives are only five or six people, surrounded layer by layer, from morning to night. Without food or drink, how can a fair and reasonable solution be obtained? (D) The factory must maintain administrative power, the power to employ people, and the power to handle affairs. The labor side must not interfere. This is necessary for management. (E) The implementation of the law must be comprehensive. One cannot choose to implement the beneficial ones and reject the unfavorable ones. Therefore, in the current labor-management disputes, the labor side often cites the Factory Law, but the Factory Law also has clear provisions regarding dismissal procedures. If the labor side can make demands based on the Factory Law, the employer can naturally handle dismissals based on the Factory Law to show equality of legal rights and obligations. The above five items are all requests that are fair and reasonable based on laws, regulations, and facts. It is hoped that the municipal authorities and the responsible authorities can give fair consideration to them and adopt and implement them immediately, so as to comfort the hopes of all industries and give them a chance to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Guiding Principles and Methods for Handling Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Labor-management problems, on the surface, seem to be confrontational, but in reality, they are not opposite but complementary. Because if the capital side only seeks cheap labor and ignores the welfare of workers, it will inevitably lead to strikes, slowdowns and other disputes. As a result, the loss of the capital side is often far more than that of the labor side. In the five suggestions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the pain caused by the strike can be described as generous.</p>
<p>As for the workers' excessive demands, making the factories that have already started work unable to survive, and the factories that have not started work hesitate to move forward, resulting in many unemployed, how is the loss of the workers' side?允Do not wait for many words to understand.</p>
<p>Therefore, what Minister Gu said in yesterday's talk: "It is quite reasonable to determine wages based on the cost of living index of workers... but if the production and business situation is not good, it is difficult for the capital side to bear it. After labor-management agreement, or government evaluation, it can also be issued in accordance with the reduced cost of living index," these few words, we believe, are a one-shot shot.</p>
<p>Originally, this principle of using the cost of living index as a principle for adjusting wages has long been adopted by the government. And "requests for conditions, such as those that are not acceptable to today's Chinese production conditions, should be rejected" has also been announced by the mayor as one of the four principles. The content of the kernel is no different from the policy set by Minister Gu. The problem is, how can this policy be effectively implemented?</p>
<p>Minister Gu said: The organization of the labor-management evaluation committee has now been agreed upon and will be established soon. The powers of the committee, in addition to adjusting treatment and urgently handling major labor-management disputes, also include preventing disputes and enforcing powers. For all illegal actions, effective restraint can be given. If it can be handled in this way, I think: the above policy can be effectively achieved. Therefore, we are very welcome to Minister Gu's policy on handling labor disputes, especially his method of handling labor disputes.</p>
<h3>Inquiries at the 8th Meeting of the Provisional Senate: Winning Over People's Hearts Requires Practicality, the Joint Liability System for Opium Prohibition Violates Democracy... Female Senators Pay More Attention to the Prostitution Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning was the third group review meeting of the Municipal Provisional Senate, and at 3:15 p.m., the eighth general meeting was held, with 26 senators in attendance.</p>
<p>Police Bureau Report</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Police Bureau Director Xuan TieWu reported on the bureau's work: Preventing bandit loyalty: (1) Universal establishment of police stations, 126 have been established. (2) Verification of civilian guns, 1,045 self-defense gun licenses have been issued, 70 legal group gun licenses, and 262 attendant gun licenses. (3) Detaining and sending vagrants and beggars. (4) Installing alarm bells. (5) Inspecting hotels and docks, etc. Reorganizing prostitutes: Those prostitutes who have been examined and found to be free of drugs will be suspended with identification, and 2,413 registration certificates have been issued. Closed 29 massage parlors, 108 guidance agencies, ordered to change to legitimate occupations, and stipulated the environment for prostitutes' activities. Prohibiting opium: As of the end of February, 607 people have been registered for provincialization, stipulating that registration will be cut off at the end of March, and cessation will be at the end of June. Strengthening traffic management: Opening one-way traffic, vehicles changed to the right, organizing traffic patrol teams, and organizing Sino-US traffic committee. Rectifying the city appearance: Unifying the county's hanging of the national flag, delineating vendor locations, banning structures, fixing canopies, and unauthorized buildings, and handling lost and missing children. Strengthening household registration surveys, sorting out foreign population cards and the city's house numbers, and verifying foreign passports, etc. In addition, the city's hotels, public entertainment venues, Chinese and Western restaurants, etc. are all within the scope of management of the bureau, and coordinate in adjusting prices and mediating labor disputes. Arresting bandits: From September 12 last year to February 28, a total of 681 bandit cases occurred, 154 were solved, 444 bandits were captured, and a total of 138 traitor cases were handled. Fire fighting and community work: A total of 321 fires have been rescued in the past six months.</p>
<p>The police bureau currently has 89 long police officers and noncommissioned officers, and 2,126 officers. In the past six months, a total of 602 police officers have been confined, punished, and dismissed for dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>Extortion should be strictly prohibited</p>
<p>After Director Xuan finished his report, Wang GenZhong put forward several opinions: (1) The police bureau should change its colonial style. (2) The style of the yamen, the bureaucratic style, formalism, arbitrariness. and the reimbursement doctrine should also be changed. (3) What are the current urgent matters? Hanging flags, installing alarm bells, etc., although they are all very good, have nothing to do with people's lives. The police bureau should win over the hearts of the people, pay attention to practicality, and should not specialize in formalism. (4) Pseudo-police should be quickly cleared and cancelled. (5) The freedom of the people's body and home should be guaranteed, and they should not be arbitrarily arrested and occupied. (6) The organization of the Sino-US Traffic Committee is inappropriate. (7) Martial law and wartime preparations in Zhabei and other places should be lifted. (8) The joint liability provisions in the opium ban are quite unreasonable and violate the modern spirit of democracy. In the future, I hope that the police bureau will use less authority, get closer to the masses, do less formalism, and get closer to practice. Xu YuanGao requested that the police should treat the people with compassion, and that extortion and other situations should be strictly prohibited. Xu ShiHao asked whether the police bureau's arrest and detention of criminals are in accordance with the regulations? Although the shortcomings of the old patrol room should not be repeated, there are also things that can be learned, that is, the arrest of criminals should first obtain a court warrant, and then be sent to the court within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Transformed prostitutes have recently been revived</p>
<p>Zhu SuE made her first speech, willing to speak loudly for the compatriots of the whole country and the next generation of citizens: (1) Although the transformed prostitutes were temporarily suspended for a while, they have recently been revived. Has there been an investigation and further ban? (2) Private prostitutes are scattered in residential areas. After reporting, they are detained for two or three days and fined 1,000 yuan, and then they can be released and continue to do business. What is the way to deal with it? (3) Is the implementation of public prostitutes certain? I hope that in the future, they can be gradually reduced by lottery until they are completely banned. The government can ban prostitution in the same system as banning opium. Lu HuiMin also raised the same question, asking for an investigation to cancel transformed prostitutes.</p>
<p>Police treatment should be improved</p>
<p>Zhao BanFu hopes (1) to improve the treatment of police officers. (2) The number of police officers accounts for one-third of the police bureau's personnel, which should be reduced, and police officers should be increased. Pseudo-police cannot be regarded as traitors in their entirety, and an investigation and identification should be conducted. (3) Road names are not easy to understand, and traffic police should point out. (4) Smoking is not allowed in theaters, which cannot include all theaters. Can the theater authorities determine this themselves? Shen Ding asked: (1) Smokers need to register, what measures should be taken for opium dealers? How to deal with vagrants smoking opium in public on the road? (2) When can the opium ban be truly implemented? I hope that I will no longer hear the term "opium ban" in the future. (3) Some traffic police officers often accept bribes, or open red lights and read books at book stalls. How to maintain traffic? Hou Yuan said that the discipline of the police in the suburbs is too poor, please correct it.</p>
<p>Director's Reply</p>
<p>Director Xuan answered them one by one: There are more than 170 guidance agencies and more than 20 massage parlors in the city. Those who have indeed changed to legitimate occupations will be banned. Passively banning private prostitutes is of little use. The purpose of establishing public prostitutes is to eliminate private prostitutes. The discipline of the police in the suburbs is indeed relatively poor, and in the future, they plan to transfer the police in the city and suburbs to each other. There is a lack of police talent. The training institute can only train 2,500 people each year. Among the current 7,000 people, more than 6,000 are pseudo-police. If they are not used for work, all work will be suspended and can only be gradually eliminated. Smoking in theaters must be prohibited. In the future, 12 female police officers will be assigned to each theater to implement persuasion in order to make up for the lack of police force. The opium ban is being actively handled. I hope that it will not be repeated in the future. Vagrants smoking opium in public has not yet been reported. If it is found out, it will be dealt with strictly. The order to sit down quickly is stipulated by the Executive Yuan, and all localities must comply with it. The police bureau arrests people, and it must be in accordance with the law. Those who cannot be sent within 24 hours are because the investigation procedures have not been completed. The court's investigation work is handled by the police bureau in cooperation. The road signs are the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works and have been approved by the municipal government. In the future, road signs must be erected at the beginning and end of each road, adding directions. Adding road names to house numbers is not easy to see clearly and has no great effect. The police attitude has been repeatedly supervised and improved. Night patrols and equipment lifting should be stipulated by the Garrison Command. Once the security personnel are enriched, they can be dismantled. The establishment of the Sino-US Traffic Committee is due to the fact that there are many US military vehicles in the city, and accidents often occur. Therefore, there is this advisory body to jointly handle order. Disputes over the occupation of houses are handled by the Municipal Government's Housing Lease Committee or the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. After the police bureau receives the orders of the two agencies or the court, it only performs the due tasks. The meeting adjourned at 6:40 p.m.</p>
<p>Review of Municipal Reports, Each Group Nominates Personnel</p>
<p>The first, second, and third review subgroups of the Senate held a joint meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to review the municipal report and the municipal government's policy guidelines for this year. Twenty-five senators attended. It was resolved that each group should nominate two people to be responsible for the review and then report to the general meeting for reconsideration. Wang GenZhong and Shen ChunHui were nominated by the first group, Xu YongZuo and Xu ShiHao by the second group, and Feng YouZhen and He BingSong by the third group. The responsible persons for reviewing the reports of the various bureaus of the municipal government have also been separately nominated. Ye FengChu and Shui XiangYun are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Public Utility Bureau. Zhou XueXiang and Wu RenCang are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Public Works Bureau. Pan XuLun and Xu ShiHao are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Land Administration Bureau. Qin RunQing and Wang ZhiShen are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Finance Bureau. Wang Bing and Shen Ding are responsible for reviewing the reports of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Military and Police Arrest of Offenders Should Comply with Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Free Association wrote to the Municipal Provisional Senate yesterday, stating: (1) It is true that most of the military and police agencies in the city transfer suspects arrested or detained to the trial agency within 24 hours in accordance with the law, but in fact, it is inevitable that they will not be transferred within 24 hours. (2) Military and police agencies are afraid of officials. If there is no warrant, they have no right to arrest people in accordance with the law. (3) If they accept suspects who have been arrested or detained, the military and police chiefs in the city often only transfer the case and request that the suspects continue to be detained, and the people's personal freedom is therefore also suspected of being infringed. The system of requesting detention and the method of detaining people without a warrant both need to be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Shen Wanling Sentenced to Three Years; All Property Confiscated; The Shafir Brothers' Case Dismissed; The Prosecution of the Nightclub Manager to be Sentenced on a Scheduled Date</h3>
<p>Shen Wanling, the manager of Sheng Sheng Pasture, was prosecuted by employees for being a traitor. The High Court has concluded the trial and announced the judgment yesterday: "Shen Wanling colluded with the enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and provided nutritional beverages. He is sentenced to three years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for family members, will be confiscated." When he left the court after the sentence, the prosecutor Shen Adi asked reporters: "How will the property be disposed of?" The reporter replied: "Confiscated." Both clapped their hands and applauded.</p>
<p>Yang Xiguang, the special high-tech detective of Tongfu Road, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of public rights for life on the same day.</p>
<p>The Shafir Al-Sur and Shafir Daiya Taur brothers, who were suspected of endangering the Republic of China, were also judged by officials as "dismissed in this case."</p>
<p>Chen Huichang and Yuan Shixiang, the managers of Venus Nightclub, were prosecuted for being traitors by Iraqi Willie Kofah. The case was tried at the same time yesterday. It was found that this case had been investigated and questioned by various agencies, including the Third Front Army, the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Military Police, the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau, and the High Court Temporary Court. More than 11 lawyers were entrusted, and the process was unusually complicated. The disputed parts are about to be reconciled, and the traitorous charges have also been debated and concluded, and the sentence will be announced on a scheduled date.</p>
<p>The Criminal Court of the High Court also tried the case of Lü Changmao, who was accused of extorting the people, and the case of Wang Xingjian, who was accused of participating in pseudo-organizations during the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Speculative Groups Show Their Skills; Public Bonds Soar and Plunge; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Initially Firm but Later Weak</h3>
<p>After public bonds rose sharply the day before yesterday, strong players held their ground. At the same time, they also promoted the legend that pre-war private debts would be repaid at 120 times the amount of the court's judgment, attracting many profiteers. The narrow debt market could not withstand a few tricks. Type C opened in the morning and jumped to 4,400 yuan, soaring to a maximum of 4,600 yuan. Many parties came out one after another in the sound of victory, breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark and falling back to 3,900 yuan. It stabilized slightly at noon. Compared with the previous closing, types A and B fell back by 300 yuan, type C fell slightly by 70 yuan, type D fell by 350 yuan, and type E fell by 250 yuan. Many new Chinese stocks continued to be added. It was stable as soon as it went on the market. The high price of Yongsha was 5,630 yuan, Meiya was 4,600 yuan, and Jingfu was 465 yuan. Other less popular stocks were particularly desolate. Even XinGuang QinXing showed a sense of despair. At noon, the popular stocks were slightly tired after the high price. The noon closing was higher than the previous closing by 430 yuan for Yongsha, 200 yuan for Meiya, 19 yuan for Jingfu, and 10 to 20 yuan for XinGuang QinXing. In the afternoon, the bid price changed from a slight increase to a slight decrease. Foreign stocks fell back after being firm yesterday. Although many parties had the strength to continue to be active, YiSha called out from 13,000 yuan in the morning to a high of 13,600 yuan. Yinglian was not as sharp as it was a few days ago and could only follow the yarn factory. Western merchants supplied at high prices and finally appeared a little tired. The results of the school's previous closing, except for slightly raising a few industries, the rest were slightly frustrated. The paper industry rose more, but fell back by less than 10% yesterday.</p>
<h3>New and Old Hong Kong Dollars Gradually Converging</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange US dollars still fluctuate slightly with the gold market. At first, it was at 1,930 yuan, but this price was difficult to maintain. It once fell to 1,910 yuan in the morning and hovered around 1,920 yuan in the afternoon, which was very peaceful. As a result, it was slightly frustrated by 5 yuan compared with the previous closing. The situation of Hong Kong dollars is still very strong. New and old continue to converge. In the middle of the way, both new and old goods showed an upward trend. As a result, the old goods were flat and the new goods rose by another 10 yuan. Robbie Hong Kong Electric are all flat.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was calm, with temporary gains quickly fading. High prices were difficult to sustain, and lacking any stimulus, there was no possibility of progress in the short term. The market opened steadily, with some activity from retail investors, briefly rising to around 1.51 million [currency unit]. High prices showed some struggle. Although the Bank of China's allocated price was low, buying interest was scattered. Holders gradually liquidated their positions, shifting funds to the stock market. The gold market remained deserted. Before noon, prices fell again to a low of 1.45 million [currency unit], later slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, trading was light around 1.48 million [currency unit]. The closing price was slightly down by 5,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous day.

The unofficial interest rates were relatively relaxed, ranging from 15% to 18%.</p>
<h3>Demand for Strip Steel is High; Orders Arriving Soon May Depress Market Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, strip steel has been selling well, especially to can manufacturers, printing factories, mirror factories, and others. The demand from tea tin factories is particularly large. However, despite strong sales, prices have not increased. This is because sellers have placed orders from abroad, which are expected to arrive in one or two months. Consequently, they have abandoned their previous stance of supporting prices and are now eager to sell off their existing inventory while they have the chance.</p>
<h3>Kueiyuan Industry Association to Rectify Sales Regulations</h3>
<p>The Kueiyuan Industry Association of this city has decided that sales regulations have been unusually chaotic during the war. Now that transportation is gradually returning to normal, it is necessary to rectify these regulations. A resolution was passed at the first general meeting of representatives that, from today onwards, all purchases from Fujian and Guangdong businesses in this city, whether by members of the industry or outsiders, formal or informal, will have a credit period of fourteen days. In cases where a shorter credit period is necessary, interest will be calculated based on the duration of the reduction and deducted from the price of the goods. The interest rate will be determined weekly by the standing directors of the association and communicated to all members for compliance.</p>
<h3>Fierce Rally in the Bombay Gold and Silver Markets Due to No Increase in Import Tax</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Financial Times commented on the fierce buying spree in the Bombay gold and silver markets, saying that developments in domestic and foreign politics may be a cause for the continued rise, but the more important factor is the delay in implementing the increase in gold and silver import taxes. In February, the Indian budget already stipulated a gold import tax rate of 25 rupees per tola of pure gold, equivalent to 180 grains, and a silver import tax rate of 8 annas per troy ounce. A financial expert said that Indian domestic prices have diverged from foreign prices, so he suggested that the tax rate should be adjusted from time to time to bring domestic prices as close as possible to global prices in an orderly manner. If the Indian market remains isolated from supply sources, it will be impossible to align with global prices because local production is insufficient to meet demand, and the amount of gold and silver available for sale to India within the Sterling Area is very small.</p>
<h3>US Department of Commerce Prevents the Re-export of Goods from the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] The US Department of Commerce has been authorized to prevent the re-export of goods urgently needed by the Philippines for reconstruction work to other countries, such as China, where prices are often higher.</p>
<h3>American-Made Cigarettes to be Distributed Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The cigarette market has never seen shipments of imported cigarettes being distributed before. It has been learned that a manager of a certain company will distribute American-made cigarettes, "Lady Hamilton" with 20 cigarettes per pack, immediately. Type A members will receive 20 cartons each, and Type B members will receive 10 cartons each. The distribution price per carton is 7,000 [currency unit]. This is the first time imported cigarettes are being distributed in the city. (De)</p>
<h3>Coal Market Enters a Slump; Firewood and Charcoal Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The coal market continues to decline, with sentiment weak. Sellers are rushing to sell, and prices continue to soften. It is difficult for the market to recover. Firewood and charcoal dealers have previously purchased goods from the producing areas, and these are now being continuously shipped to Shanghai. As a result, supply has increased recently, inventories have swelled rapidly, sales have become sluggish, and market prices are gradually declining.</p>
<h3>Tung Wood Arrives in Large Quantities; Overview of Production and Sales in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Among the southeastern provinces of China, besides Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian all produce timber. Anhui and Jiangxi are known for producing fir, with Jiangxi fir being of higher quality and therefore commanding a higher price than Anhui fir. The distribution centers are Nanchang and Jiujiang. Before the war, Jiangxi fir was in high demand along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, and timber merchants often went to Nanchang and Jiujiang to purchase and transport it for sale.</p>
<p>Anhui fir is of lower quality, but production is quite abundant, with Tunxi as the distribution center. During the war, fir trees were planted on the mountains along the upper reaches of the Xin'an River. Now that water transport has resumed, Anhui fir is being shipped downstream in large quantities, mainly to Hangzhou, where the current price is 84,000 [currency unit] per unit. With the continued influx of Anhui fir, prices are expected to fall. In Tunxi, Anhui fir sells for just over 30,000 [currency unit] per unit. The shipping cost from Tunxi to Hangzhou is 8,800 [currency unit] per unit, and there are transportation companies providing this service. However, the price of mountain products is rising, making it difficult to purchase in Tunxi. Because Anhui fir has convenient transportation and is cheaper than Jiangxi fir, it is currently selling well in southern Jiangsu, replacing Jiangxi fir.</p>
<p>In central Zhejiang, fir is also produced, but the quality is even lower, and it is mostly small-sized timber. The distribution center is Hangzhou. Besides fir, Zhejiang also produces tung wood in Wenzhou and other places, called "Wenzhou Tung," which currently sells for 45,000 [currency unit] per unit in Shanghai.</p>
<p>As for Fujian, tung wood is the main product, called "Fujian Tung," which is famous both domestically and abroad. High-quality coffin materials are often made from this "Fujian Tung." It has been in high demand in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Timber merchants often go to the mountains of Fujian to purchase it, tie it to the sides of boats, and tow it to Shanghai for distribution to various places.</p>
<p>It is reported that large quantities of fir and tung wood have arrived in this city, so timber prices are trending downward. Large quantities of American pine have also arrived, so there should be no shortage of timber for construction projects in the future.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Industry Reduces Dyeing Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Members of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, after adjusting dyeing prices this spring, have struggled to maintain them due to rising costs of dyes and fuels.

<h3>US Paper Production Increases, But Still Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>The United States needs a large amount of timber for post-war construction and building houses, and the increased labor costs have affected the cost of papermaking. The paper produced recently is far below the previous standards. The so-called best quality "Victory Paper" has become a thing of the past. It is reported that the paper production in the United States this year is actually more than the same period last year, but it cannot meet the demand due to the sudden increase in demand from various countries after the war. This shortage may last for some time.</p>
<h3>Chinese Bristles Seek an Outlet to the United States in an Attempt to Regain Their Original Market</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] Business sources told Reuters yesterday that bristle supplies are very smooth, especially the arrival of goods from China, which is very beneficial to the United States in meeting domestic and export needs. In the last three months of last year, the average monthly import of bristles by the United States was 155,000 pounds. The import volume in the first three months of this year must be much higher. Chongqing and Hankou are currently not supplying bristles to the United States due to difficulties in labor and transportation within China, but the general trend within China is clearly to regain the entire US market, which was held by Indian and South American bristle merchants during the war. China is currently offering the United States bristle and freight prices of 5 yuan and 5.6 yuan per pound for Tianjin and 2.9 yuan per pound for Shanghai. The prices two weeks ago were 6 yuan, 6.6 yuan, and 3.25 yuan. In the past month, the United States sold a considerable amount of bristles to the United Kingdom, but this sales channel has now been drastically reduced because the British supply department is unwilling to allocate US dollars. The department itself may have a considerable amount of inventory and must use it up first. France purchased a large quantity of bristles last fall, and then it was intermittent, and recently it purchased in the market again.</p>

At the same time, it should also cover knowledge of sexuality and the prevention of venereal diseases. The conference further resolved that admission tests for secondary schools should not be based solely on examination results, but should also consider teacher reports and students' previous activities. After admission, a strict guidance system should be implemented to give students the opportunity to choose subjects. Psychological assessments should also be used to determine students' personalities and which subjects they are suitable for.</p>

<h3>Disaster-Stricken Schools Petition; City Council Agrees to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from this City] Private schools that suffered during the war, with school buildings destroyed and suffered significant losses, have submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Education Bureau, and the Enemy Property Management Bureau, but after months, there has been no result.

They were received by Speaker Xi Yushu, who expressed great sympathy for the plight of the schools, saying that although there are still surplus enemy property buildings in Shanghai, military, police, and administrative authorities still seem to feel that there are not enough. As for the allocation of repair funds, the government is duty-bound to provide assistance, but given the current financial difficulties, the government also faces challenges. However, education is the most important task in reconstruction and should not be neglected. The City Council, as a representative body of the people, should strive to secure the well-being of the people. He absolutely accepts the proposals and will thoroughly discuss them at the meeting to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Reconstruction Requires 100 Million; Half of the Funds Have Been Raised</h3>
<p>[Report from this City] Since Shanghai University resumed classes in Shanghai, it has made great progress. The current enrollment includes 900 students in the university, 550 students in the middle school, and 600 students in the city business school. Since the war, the school has temporarily moved to Tu Ming Yuan Road. Now, because the space is insufficient, the Board of Directors has decided to move back to the original site in Yangshupu. However, the school buildings have been occupied by the Japanese army for a long time and have been severely damaged. All the equipment has been looted. The cost of repairs and replacements is estimated at 100 million [currency unit]. In addition to the efforts of the American Church and alumni, 50 million [currency unit] has been raised. The remaining funds are being actively raised by President Ling Xianyang and the Board of Directors and Alumni Association.

In order to assist poor students, a work-study program has been registered, which will help the school to organize the relocation while earning tuition and living expenses. This year is also the 40th anniversary of the founding of the school. The students and alumni association are preparing for the celebration.</p>
<h3>Football League First Division Match: Jiao Qiao vs. Jewish Team to Meet Today; 3 pm at Jiaozhou Park</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Qingming Festival, and the weather turned cold with rain. It is hoped that the weather will improve today so that the first division football match between the Italian and Jewish teams can be held. Tomorrow, there will be an even more exciting match between Dong Qing. Today, the meeting between the Italian and Jewish teams will be staged at 3 pm at Jiaozhou Park. He Chunhui will be the referee. Both the Italian and Jewish teams are foreign teams. Although this match does not affect the championship, the tactics of both teams are considered quite excellent. They are two of the strongest teams and are worth watching for their skills. Looking at the standings, if the Jewish team wins, it can secure third place. If Qingbai loses to Donghua, the Jewish team can even jump to second place. A win for the Italian team will have little impact. At best, it can tie with the Jewish team for third place. Therefore, the Jewish team has a stronger momentum. Looking at the overall strength, I believe the Italian team should still win.</p>

<h3>Weakness and Motherly Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Wenxin</p>
<p>Written to Commemorate the First Children's Day After the Victory of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Love is the root of all life. Without love in the universe, all life would be extinguished. If people only observe and exploit each other, engage in deception, compete and kill, and are cold and ruthless, then all the young will be unable to grow, the weak will find it extremely difficult to survive, and those in danger will be unable to escape death. The human world will only have danger, gloom, and no more light or warmth. Today, war, famine, poverty, ignorance, and various desires and feelings of superiority cause the majority of people in the world to lose their true nature, become cold and ruthless, and only know how to exploit. What can the weak provide for exploitation? They only drift and fall, wander without help, and await death in despair. The continuation of the human race and the vitality of heaven and earth are in grave danger because of this. The way to save them lies first in promoting love among humanity. Everyone should love all the weak with the heart of a loving mother for her child, and support all the weak. "Where can I find a mother's heart to shine upon the lean in the ditches?" Everything in heaven and earth inevitably carries some pretense, but only a mother's heart is the noblest and brightest, automatically emanating self-sacrificing love from the purest place in the soul, without regard for reward or cost. The weaker and more useless the other party is, the more special the love is. A mother wholeheartedly "takes others as the center," sacrifices herself, and helps others to succeed, diligently nurturing them to grow up. "Thirty days of hard work, the mother grows thin, the chicks grow fat." The greatness of motherly love is unparalleled, one aspect of which is sacrificing oneself to help others succeed, and the other is not considering the other party's beauty or ugliness or any utilitarianism, but simply loving deeply. A maternal butterfly uses all its energy to protect the life of a later generation she has never met, placing eggs near the roots of a flowering tree in a warm place suitable for hatching, while she herself dies in the nearby damp soil. Schopenhauer believed that the world's will is motivated by the pursuit of the permanent survival of the race itself, and the highest expression of the sacrificial spirit of motherly love is the fulfillment of the world's will. The tacit understanding, mutual understanding, and spiritual exchange between mother and child also become the best example of human connection. "A mother's face is like the morning sun, gentle and kind; a mother's grace is like the vast ocean, endlessly deep." May everyone take the great love of a compassionate mother as an example, sympathize with the weak, support the weak, and help others to succeed without regard for gain or loss. Then how gentle and lovely will the human world be? May all those who are fathers in the world not allow the most cherished inherent motherly love to be lost even for a moment! May all growing beings in the world take the love of a compassionate mother as an example, expand their sympathy and compassion for the young, and support the weak, and not allow the atmosphere of power, coldness, and gloom to grow again in the human world!</p>
<p>Now, on the first Children's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance, we look at the world where the strong compete and the weak die, and we cannot help but deeply feel that the countless drifting weak cannot be ignored, and the motherly love in the human world is all the more worth cherishing. We respectfully write this article as a call, and explain its meaning to present concrete suggestions to the authorities and those with good intentions:</p>
<p>(1) In future school education, starting from national schools, in language and other courses that contain the function of cultivating morality, the teaching materials on promoting motherly love and all sympathy for the weak and elderly, containing pure and sacred feelings, should occupy a considerable proportion, and at a minimum, should not be less than the proportion of teaching materials that instill knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of social education, popular reading materials, songbooks, ballads, music, films, dramas, and all artistic creations and performances that promote motherly love and compassion for the weak and elderly should be vigorously promoted and rewarded.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of folk customs, in addition to actively promoting kindness in helping the weak, respecting and helping the elderly, compassion, and filial piety, all habit songs, proverbs, slang, and theatrical performances that involve disrespect for motherhood and playing with or destroying the weak should be eliminated.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of law, a special clause for the protection of mothers and infants should be specifically stipulated in the constitution, and where the civil and criminal laws involve harming mothers and infants, they should be fully protected.</p>
<p>(5) At national transportation hubs and wharves, women, children, the elderly, and the sick should be treated with the same preference as military police and public officials, with special ticket sales, and should be allowed to board and disembark ships and vehicles first.</p>
<p>(6) During disasters and emergencies, mothers and infants in all regions should be given priority in relief.</p>
<p>(7) In terms of medical care, health centers should be established in all parts of the country, with obstetrics and pediatrics as indispensable departments.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding the necessity of counteracting utilitarianism, valuing morality, and ensuring the continuation and prosperity of the race, all countries in the world should adopt the protection of mothers and infants as a common policy.</p>
<p>(9) In the event of war, the abuse or killing of mothers and infants of enemy countries should be absolutely prohibited.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Full Political Report to the Political Consultative Conference (Continued)</h3>
<p>The consultation on the Political Consultative Conference and constitutional principles, especially the principle of amending the draft constitution in the five consultation proposals of the Political Consultative Conference, is of particular importance. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and the final decision-making power of the constitution naturally lies with the National Assembly. However, before the constitution is formulated, anyone in the country, regardless of who they are, can put forward good opinions as a reference for deciding on the draft constitution. The Constitutional Drafting Group of the Political Consultative Conference has already gathered the opinions of representatives from all parties attending, and has decided to organize a Constitutional Review Committee, with the meeting time set for two months.</p>
<p>Careful Review of the Draft Constitution to Provide for Adoption by the National Assembly</p>
<p>During these two months, the work of the Constitutional Review Committee will be based on the principles of modification measures of the Consultative Conference, and will refer to the results of the Constitutional Government Preparatory Committee, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association's revision proposal research, and opinions put forward by various parties, summarizing and organizing them to produce the Fifth-Fifth Draft Constitution Amendment for adoption by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee conducted a thorough and cautious examination of the constitutional draft amendment principles. Before the examination report was submitted to the congress, the representatives of the Kuomintang attending the Constitutional Draft Review Committee presented the opinions of the majority of the Central Committee members to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee for discussion. On the fifteenth of last month, a joint meeting of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group reached an agreement on the following three items: (1) The National Assembly is a tangible National Assembly; (2) The second item of Article 6 of the constitutional draft amendment principles is canceled, stipulating that if the Legislative Yuan has a vote of no confidence in the entire Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan shall either resign or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, but the same Premier shall not request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan again; (3) Provincial constitutions shall be changed to provincial autonomy laws.</p>
<p>It was not until the sixteenth of last month that the Second Plenary Session accepted the examination report on the constitutional draft amendment principles and decided to authorize the committee to be responsible for handling the examination opinions as the following five items:</p>
<p>(1) The formulation of the constitution should be based on the Founding Program as the most fundamental basis.</p>
<p>(2) The National Assembly should be a tangible organization, exercising the powers stipulated in the Founding Program in a concentrated congressional manner, and the number of times it is convened should be appropriately increased.</p>
<p>(3) The Legislative Yuan should not have the right to consent to or distrust the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan should not have the right to request the dissolution of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The Control Yuan should not have the right to consent.</p>
<p>(5) Provinces do not need to formulate provincial constitutions.</p>
<p>Constitution Not Yet Promulgated, Provisional Constitution Fundamentally Valid</p>
<p>The resolution of the Second Plenary Session on the agreement of the Political Consultative Conference clearly declared the Chinese Kuomintang's sincere commitment and determination to implement it. The attitude of the entire session in putting forward opinions on constitutional principles based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings was extremely cautious. In advance, the party representatives proposed the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and the Comprehensive Group to reach an agreement, and afterwards authorized the Central Standing Committee to handle it, in order to obtain understanding from all parties. All of this is sufficient to show its consistent painstaking efforts of tolerance, concession, and compromise. Unexpectedly, the CCP delegation issued a statement accusing the Second Plenary Session of creating a confusing situation in violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Who is creating the confusing situation and who is creating this propaganda that confuses right and wrong, clear-sighted people will naturally understand and there is no need to say more. However, our government still adheres to the policy of forbearance for the sake of the country and continues to study and discuss with them with great concentration, waiting quietly for a solution. Unexpectedly, the CCP representatives suddenly proposed a motion in the Comprehensive Group a few days ago, which surprised us very much. They advocated that "during the transition period from political tutelage to constitutional government, the laws of the political tutelage period should be abolished immediately, and the organization law of the national government jointly participated in by various parties on the principle of equality and legality should be formulated in accordance with the agreement on the organization of the government of the Political Consultative Conference." I think it is necessary to briefly explain this major issue:</p>
<p>The Provisional Constitution of the Political Tutelage Period is the National Organization Law formulated by the National Assembly in the 20th year of the Republic of China. This Provisional Constitution can only be replaced by the constitution formulated by the National Assembly. Before the constitution is promulgated, the law of the political tutelage period is fundamentally valid. It must be known that a country cannot be without a government for a day, and a government cannot be without laws for a day, especially the fundamental law on which the country and the government are based—the law. Our national government was established based on the law of the political tutelage period, and it exercises its powers according to the law of the political tutelage period. If the constitution has not yet been promulgated, and the law is abolished first, China will not have a legitimate government, and the country will fall into a state of [omitted].</p>
<p>Our government and the Second Plenary Session respect the Political Consultative Conference and have the greatest determination to implement the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference. However, we must explain the nature of the Political Consultative Conference. The Political Consultative Conference is not, in essence, a constitutional convention. The agreement of the Political Consultative Conference on the organization of the government cannot, in essence, replace the Provisional Constitution. The step to end political tutelage can only be taken by convening the National Assembly. If it is to replace the law and become the fundamental law on which the national organization of the constitutional government period is based, then it can only be the constitution formulated by the National Assembly. Therefore, when the Political Consultative Conference was held, the national government repeatedly declared that the expansion of the government's organization this time was based on the existing foundation of the national government, and it requested people from various parties and social elites to participate together to expand the scope of the government, and it was by no means to overthrow the foundation of the current national government and organize another government. This principle is almost known to all at home and abroad, so it can be clearly understood that the purpose of our expansion of the government organization this time is to enable the government to gather the opinions of the whole country, concentrate the strength of the whole country, and win the victory of peace during the transition period from political tutelage to constitutional government, jointly discuss the policy of national construction, prepare for the convocation of the National Assembly, and establish the foundation for the implementation of constitutional government. Among them, there is also a kind of painstaking effort to compromise and seek perfection, which is to lead many illegal facts in the country to a legal track. If the constitution has not yet been promulgated, and the law is abolished first, then the result obtained by the government's six months of effort is not peace but chaos, not unity but division, not a legal track that everyone can follow, but an illegal disaster that everyone can create. This is completely contrary to the purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference. If the Political Consultative Conference really becomes such a kind of meeting, our government and the people of the whole country will never recognize it. Otherwise, the result of the Chinese Kuomintang's fifty years of revolutionary efforts, the political power that the people of the whole country should get, will not have an explanation, and the sacrifices of our compatriots across the country in the eight-year War of Resistance will not have any meaning. This is not only unacceptable to the government, but also absolutely unacceptable to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, what I have said above is the process of the national government's efforts for peace and national construction in the past six months. The national government abides by international law and respects treaty faith externally, and adopts the policy of forbearance for the sake of the country internally. All measures conducive to peace and national construction must be compromised and accommodated in order to implement them. The agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, the measures for mediating military conflicts, and the plans for reorganizing the national army and unifying the CCP's troops are all produced by the spirit of the government's forbearance for the sake of the country. The government has the greatest sincerity and determination to implement them one by one. The most urgent thing now is the establishment of the National Government Committee resolved by the Consultative Conference. We are waiting for the various parties to submit their lists so that the wish to expand the scope of the national government and concentrate the opinions and strengths of all parties can be realized as soon as possible!

<h3>The Famine Situation in Guangxi Province: People Fighting Over Tree Bark and Vegetable Roots; Leading to a "Starvation" Election</h3>
<p>Spring has deepened; the hero trees of the South burst into bloom, and petals fall, carpeting the ground in red. In the sorrowful dance of flying catkins, facing this season that most easily evokes infinite thoughts, gazing at the desolate environment, and plunged into the abyss of starvation, people's hearts truly cannot express whether it is sour or bitter. Willow branches are newly grown, and the fine rain has not ceased. The days are filled with a lingering spring chill. Although we cannot see spring snow here, everyone seems to still be standing on the edge of winter.</p>
<p>The terrible disaster has created a calamitous year after the calamity. The disaster victims in more than twenty counties in northern Guangxi enthusiastically welcomed victory, but also helplessly plunged into the embrace of a famine year. On one side, the vested interests and the bureaucratic capital groups are laughing gleefully at the soaring prices. On the other side, the helpless and defenseless farmers are gnawing on grass roots, shedding silent tears. Others have heard enough of the sorrowful cries of the Hunan region and sympathize with the disaster victims near the lake. But who knows that in the areas of Luzhai and Zhongdu in northern Guangxi, every day, a tragic event occurs where forty to fifty people must starve to death? Who knows that the entire county has been fighting for a whole month over the seizure of a banana tree forest (the bark of banana trees is their food!)? The children of Guangxi are too good at enduring suffering. There is no speaker of the assembly to appeal to the central government for them, and the communications agencies do not report on it at all. The refugees are simply enduring the winter and then the spring under the mocking laughter of death. The dead are gone, and the living are waiting to be saved. Today, we want to issue a loud accusation on behalf of the children of Guangxi!</p>
<h3>No Grain in Autumn and Winter, Bitter Starvation in Spring: Gathering Wild Food in Groups</h3>
<p>The spread of famine is equally tragic in all directions of Guangxi, especially in the counties along the Hunan-Guangxi railway line. They have suffered once from war and then from insect plagues and drought. Last year, both seasons yielded no harvest. Since last September until now, it is estimated that more than 10,000 refugees in Luzhai, Zhongdu, and Cheng counties have starved to death. There is no grain in autumn and winter, and bitter starvation comes in spring. Nineteen out of ten people have left their homes and gone far away, gathering in groups in the mountains to dig up wild arrowhead, wild water chestnuts, and bracken roots to eat. People have no desires; they just hope to find roots that are slightly fatter and more tender to stuff into their mouths. They will laugh bitterly. Ah! These Bo Yi and Shu Qi, whom no one will pity in this life or in countless lives to come, what is their future? In a village fifty miles north of Rong County, a family of five could not even find wild arrowheads to eat, so the father killed his three children and then committed suicide with his wife. It is truly heartbreaking and tragic! The entire county, including Xing'an, Lingchuan, Guanyang, and even Hecheng and Babu in eastern Guangxi, has long been plunged into a land of terror. A reporter once asked a gentleman from Hecheng County: "Is your county also suffering from famine recently?" The gentleman replied with a sad smile: "Ah, recently? Our hometown has been eating grass roots since last October!" The conversation ended with everyone silently lowering their heads.</p>
<h3>The Gravedigger Said: "Today I Carry Corpses, Tomorrow Who Will Carry Me?"</h3>
<p>In the villages of northern Guangxi, people have generally become so accustomed to starving to death that no one pays attention. Those who are tasked with burying the corpses will say with emotion: "Today I carry corpses, who knows who will carry me tomorrow!" When refugees dig for wild vegetables and bracken roots, they often dig up a corpse. However, fortunately, it has not yet reached the point of people eating people. As for the tragic news of fighting over vegetable roots in the villages of Siwei, Heping, and Sanli in the entire county, both sides have long become numb and lost their minds. A village chief said with red eyes: "Dying by fighting is the same as dying from starvation, what use is there for this cheap life!" There is also the news that the Xie Shimei family of seven in Tong'an Village ate wild celery for nine days and died of poisoning, painfully stinging every wounded heart. In Nanlongzhou and even Wuzhou in eastern Guangxi, there is also a type of "food" that must be eaten even though it will definitely lead to death, which is a kind of mud called "Guanyin Powder." It can fill the stomach when eaten, but within ten days, one will swell up and lose their life. But besides "Guanyin Powder," where can the refugees find flour?</p>
<h3>Permission Granted for Staff to Suspend Salaries and Retain Positions: Government Affairs Come to a Standstill</h3>
<p>Amidst the sound of grain shortages, there are two more heartbreaking situations. One is that because there are no seeds or cattle for spring plowing (Guangxi's draft cattle lost 75% during the war), tenant farmers are returning their fields to the landlords. The landlords cannot accept the losses and refuse, which increases serious disputes. As a result, neither side manages the land, and it lies barren. The tragic situation of last winter's harvest has not ended, and the situation this spring is so dire that it is unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>The other is that because there is no local tax revenue, the counties most affected by the disaster can only allow staff to suspend their salaries and retain their positions to seek other means of livelihood, leading to the paralysis of government affairs, the disintegration of morale, and the formation of a state of anarchy, which poses a major problem for public security. Some counties are illegally collecting exorbitant levies from the wealthy in order to maintain the situation, resulting in further impoverishment of the people.</p>
<p>The provincial authorities are not unaware of these tragic phenomena and the serious consequences that can be imagined, but we can frankly say that the provincial authorities are aware but helpless. There are many requests but little action. By the time the money arrives, most of the refugees have already starved to death. Moreover, whether the money will arrive at all is still a question. But then again, how can there be any solutions without money? In the end, it is still the deeply impoverished disaster victims who suffer.</p>
<h3>Even a Spoonful of Rice Gruel is Sweet in the Hearts of the Refugees</h3>
<p>Recently, I heard that 5,000 tons of flour have been shipped to Guangxi, and the Relief Administration has agreed to allocate all 140 million yuan of the second phase of business expenses to various counties in the restored areas for farmers to purchase seeds and fertilizers, and to allocate 20 million yuan to build refugee shelters in Guilin. Although there is too little porridge for too many monks, even if the refugees get a spoonful of rice water, their hearts will be sweet. May God bless that those complicated application procedures do not appear, and may the flour and money truly fall into the hands of the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Recently, the Relief Administration also decided to use "work-for-relief" and "farming-for-relief" methods to build water conservancy projects, using disaster victims to build dikes in places such as Jila in Liuzhou, Jinji River in Yongfu, and Wuming and Wuyuan River, and to launch spring plowing by opening the Shapu Farm in Liuzhou on a large scale. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is good to have a plan.</p>
<p>Also, because of the preciousness of rice, Guangxi Province decided to ban brewing. In order to preserve the strength of the fields, it was decided to prohibit the slaughter of draft cattle. Seeing the farmers lying in the rice paddies, desperately dragging the plow themselves during spring plowing, can you imagine that this is still something humans do? But today, nineteen out of ten farmers in Guangxi are doing the work of cattle themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, a piece of news about the food shortage: today, rice in northeastern Guangxi has broken through the 40,000 yuan mark. Tens of thousands of bags of military grain are being transported out of Wuzhou. So-called enterprise companies are钻(zhuān - to drill) their way into the rice piles, engaging in large-scale hoarding and purchasing, using the profits to subsidize the insurance funds of the company.</p>
<h3>The Situ Qiao Couple Came to Sketch: The Drawings Will Be Exhibited in America</h3>
<p>In order to record a famine picture for the seven million disaster victims, the Relief Administration invited the famous painter Situ Qiao and his wife to Guangxi to sketch on-site, preparing to exhibit the tragic situation of the Guangxi disaster victims in the United States, hoping to obtain more relief. In these days, taking care of the stomach is the most important thing, and the issue of face can be discussed after one's belly is full.</p>
<h3>"Starvation" Election</h3>
<p>In starvation, the people of each county, with empty hearts, are electing provincial councilors and township chiefs while gnawing on tree bark in the atmosphere of democracy. Therefore, those who are enthusiastic about being "representatives" and "public servants" are vigorously campaigning. It is truly "money if you have money" and "rice if you have rice." As long as you vote for me, I will help you solve tomorrow's meal and think of ways to help your family. In this way, the village chiefs and heads of households are having a great time. The "candidates" are hosting banquets today and sewing new clothes for them tomorrow. Considering the value of a vote, the starving people get some benefits. There are all sorts of tricks. What a democracy! If it must have a name, call it the "starvation election."</p>
<h3>University Students Hate Partridge River: Shouting to Go Back to Wuzhou</h3>
<p>While everyone is racking their brains over the problem of "eating," a group of Guangxi University students who are tired of living in Liuzhou's Partridge River are clamoring to go back to Wuzhou, and it is getting more and more fierce, even leading to a major strike. At the beginning of the month, they held a large parade in Liuzhou, and at first, people thought they were pleading for the recovery of the Northeast, but it turned out that they just wanted to go back to Wuzhou. Then there was a strike, fundraising, getting cars, getting boats, turning the world upside down. They are still not attending classes. The Ministry of Education sent a supervisor to mediate, but there was no way. When the supervisor arrived at the school, the students posted slogans and shouted slogans. One of them was "The Partridge River in Liuzhou is hell, the Butterfly Mountain in Wuzhou is heaven." The Ministry of Education allocated 40 million yuan for the school to move back to Guilin, and allocated the former electrical equipment factory as the site for the College of Science and Engineering. However, the students are always clamoring to go to Wuzhou (probably because Wuzhou is closer to Guangzhou), and they refuse to attend classes no matter what. As a result, President Li Yunhua was at a loss and resigned in Chongqing. He was succeeded by Chen Jianxiu, who is said to have a headache over this incident and is unwilling to take office immediately.</p>
<h3>The Incense at Yao Mountain is Deserted: The Li River Flows Eastward Like a Sob</h3>
<p>It is said that the Guilin Normal College will move to Yongning during the summer vacation, which everyone is very willing to do. Writers Mu Mutian and his wife are still teaching at the Normal College. Recently, a cultural association was established in Guilin, and a declaration of more than 2,000 words was published. The Guilin GOEX radio station, which was quite famous in the past, also plans to resume broadcasting recently. In spring, the only seeds that can sprout are cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>The third month of the lunar calendar is the time for the incense fair at Yao Mountain in Guilin. In previous years, countless devout men and women would prostrate themselves and burn incense. Unfortunately, this year, many grand events have been overshadowed by a sense of vicissitude. At the foot of Yao Mountain, the wind is desolate and the rain is bitter, and tourists are sparse. People's hearts have long been washed clean by the sobbing Li River flowing eastward. Who says that Bodhisattvas are not efficacious, giving people such great suffering? (March 25th)</p>

<h3>Please Abolish the Air Raid Alarms in Our City</h3>
<p>Editor: Since the Japanese surrendered and our country was restored, the city authorities have not abolished the air raid alarm equipment that the Japanese used in Shanghai. Instead, they prescribe that it is sounded every day at noon and every Sunday at 9 AM, so that residents hear the sound and are on alert. This method is not good. Here is a list of my opinions:</p>
<p>(1) When the Japanese occupied this city, air raid alarms were sounded thousands of times. Citizens would shiver upon hearing the sound, and many developed heart disease as a result. Now that our country has been restored and there are no actual air raids, we should not continue to let the 3 million citizens of Shanghai hear this terrifying sound, which affects the peace of their minds and prevents them from living and working in peace.</p>
<p>(2) Because the Japanese frequently sounded air raid and alert alarms, many fellow citizens have developed heart disease. Because the current environment has not yet improved, the cost of living is rising, and they are not getting enough nutrition, their illnesses have not yet been cured. If they continue to hear the alarm, even if it is not a wide-scale air raid, they will still be terrified, and their illnesses will be difficult to cure soon.</p>
<p>(3) During the war, citizens would panic upon hearing the alarm and rush to buy daily necessities and food, causing prices to rise. This is a fact. In order to avoid stimulating rising prices, it seems necessary to abolish the air raid alarms during this safe period in the city.</p>
<p>(4) The international situation has not yet completely cleared. If a third world war unfortunately breaks out in the future, then our city will inevitably have to implement official air raid alarms again. Therefore, we should eliminate the current alarms to avoid affecting the effectiveness of future official air raid alarms.</p>
<p>The above points are just a few of the major issues. There are many other related issues, but I will not list them all. I ask that the city authorities quickly consider them. If they confirm that my opinions are well-founded, they should abolish the air raid alarms immediately. This will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the citizens!</p>

<h3>Small Weekly Newspapers and Social Morals</h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>The responsibility of newspapers is to lead social thought and enlighten the people. However, there are many drawbacks. For example, newspapers with colored pictures have other purposes. Also, some newspapers intentionally exaggerate certain news materials for no reason, which only makes readers waste their precious time!</p>
<p>Recently, small weekly newspapers in Shanghai have sprung up like mushrooms, and many of them mix news of war with pornography to attract readers. Although there are some that are "decent," they are very few! In this situation of expensive paper, I don't know how much they waste indiscriminately. Not only is this a waste of resources, but it can also affect social morals and give bad suggestions to some young people with weak wills.</p>
<p>For example, the "Sun Lao-Bohrmann" case in the past caused Parisian tabloids to sell as many as 500,000 copies, but as a result, the crime rate in Belgium and Italy increased because of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau will severely crack down on works with pornography or obscene content.</p>
<h3>Inspiration from the New China: Reminiscences of Ancient Greece</h3>
<p>— Gu Liang</p>
<p>Introducing Luo Niansheng's "Random Talks on Greece"</p>
<p>"Greek Civilization," what a headless play it seems! "It is the highest peak of world civilization and the source of modern civilization: modern philosophy, literature, art, and democratic regimes all originated in Greece..." (Page 6) However, despite its simple and accessible language, and the lighthearted depiction of Greek civilization, works like Mr. Luo Niansheng's "Random Talks on Greece" are probably still hard to find in our writings, even though it is just a thin booklet. (Young friends, be among the first to read it; this booklet has been published in the mainland for three full years, but it can still be considered brand new in the recovered areas.)</p>
<p>When we learn about a civilization, we naturally start with its fundamental spirit. What is the spirit of Greek civilization? The author proposes several main characteristics: pursuit of health, love of learning, creativity, love of humanity, love of beauty, moderation, love of freedom. Good health, willingness to work hard, love of "people," love of beauty, love of freedom - in short, a creative outlook on life. There is no problem with this and it can be welcomed. It is only that the point of moderation, at least for most of our young friends, may be extremely unpleasant. However, our author says this: "The Greeks abide by the principle of moderation, they abide by The Golden Mean, they do not overdo things, they do not go to extremes." Moreover, he emphasizes: "This is the secret of Greek life." He also says, "The Greeks are good at reconciling the individual with the government, the soul with the body, the ideal with reality, and are good at connecting two extremes. There is never a rebellious movement in their literature, precisely because their reason and emotion are harmonious, and form and content are in harmony." (Page 13)</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is one point that makes us believe that the Greeks are even more worthy of our love, and at the same time, they are even more "human," even though our author says in such a vague and confusing way: "It seems that only love is not something the Greeks can understand. They even believe that this thing will degrade the nobility of literature, which is so different from our concept. Even now, there is no chasing of men and women in Athens during the day, but at night, they have moonlight every night, and all the young people in the city are paired up, laughing and singing loudly, and even the birds in the garden are unwilling to sleep. This is something I cannot understand." (Page 11) What the author "cannot understand" should be precisely where we can especially "understand" the Greeks.</p>
<p>Despite casually talking about Greece, the author never forgets his motherland from beginning to end in writing this booklet. Opening the door to see the mountain, the first article is "Ancient Greece and China." In fact, this booklet as a whole was probably written in a kind of symphonic mood of reminiscence of "ancient Greece" and longing for a "new China." The author now seems to be in the same mood at this moment, recommending it to our young readers. The author of "Random Talks on Greece" would not think that I am being overly presumptuous in my understanding of his original intention in writing the book, would he? Regarding the point of not forgetting the motherland, I don't want to give many examples and quotes, because all young friends who are willing to read with an open mind will definitely be smart and wise enough to understand the good intentions that the author reveals everywhere. At the end of "Ancient Greece and China," the author made two beautiful dreams. The first was in prose, where he regretted the loss of ancient Chinese art to foreign lands and hoped that "our Alexander will be able to go east and retrieve them." The second was in verse, where he stated that in addition to the Greek influence we have received, he said: "If someone is willing to search on those mountain roads or sea routes, perhaps they can still find traces left behind when the ancient Greek dance troupes fluttered and flew to the Tang and Song palaces." (See page 5 above) That was originally a difficult but important and interesting topic in the history of Chinese dance and music. Perhaps we already have relatively detached scholars researching, excavating, and sorting it out in solitude.</p>
<p>The author "lived in Greece for a year" (Preface). He affectionately reminisces about the scenery there. "Night in Athens" (Article 3) belongs to the same beautiful and exquisite tone as his recently published collection of essays "Hibiscus City" (written about the scenery of the capital): "Nine columns of light, each with a goddess enshrined below... You should remember Erato, who holds a lyre in her hand. At this time, perhaps, someone is calling Erato, which is not someone praying before God, but just someone calling that flower girl. She is holding a bouquet of roses, Roda, Roda (rose)!" "Regardless of whether the weather is good or not, the weather must be good that day, there are three hundred sunny days a year." "But I still advise you to watch Greek comedies and listen to Eastern tunes. The sound is very long, and you have to sing along with everyone. New songs permeate the whole city all night long." (Pages 16 and 17 above)</p>
<p>While introducing the "American College in Athens" (Article 4), the author says with infinite emotion: "Major European and American countries have established classical colleges in Athens. We don't even talk about such facilities, and someone should go back and read some practical books. We now need to read some practical books like this, and this method is valuable." (Page 23) The author's impression of the Greek weather is probably too deep, and in addition to repeatedly praising it, he emphasizes: "I dare say that the weather is better in Greece than anywhere else." (Page 23) I am afraid that our Kunming cannot compare.</p>
<p>After leaving Greece and heading straight for Rome, the author took the time to enter the quaint Sicily and recorded the "Itinerary," which was nothing more than a true record.</p>
<p>"Jiao Da" (Article 6) records a compatriot who has been stranded in Greece for I don't know eight or eighteen years, from Dagukou. Many years ago, he was a sailor on a Dutch ship. Because he was drunk, he missed the ship in Constantinople and was stranded in Greece: the author bravely came forward and tried to help him return to his motherland. And hoped that he would "return to Dagukou to be a fishing chief and spend his wandering life forever; otherwise, he would stay in Shanghai and be a hero." (Page 36) The title "Jiao Da" definitely evokes a wrong association, making people unable to help but remember the clean old brand Jiao Da in front of the gate of the Jia Mansion, who saw the point with one needle.</p>
<p>The above six articles are all the author's reminiscences of that year in Greece, written before the Great War; during the war, he wrote some more historical stories of Greek resistance, collected in this booklet a total of eight articles: "The Battle of Marathon," "The Council of State," "Defending Thermopylae," "The Battle of Salamis," "Alexander's Marching Notes," "Elephant Battle," "Alexander's Injury Notes," "The Death of Alexander" - all are the best patriotic stories, none of which are not worth singing and crying about!</p>
<p>Obviously, in the last three articles, "How to Study Greek Literature," "Characteristics of Greek Tragedy," "Greek Sculpture," what the author hopes from young readers is by no means just second-hand knowledge of the ancient Greek kingdom, but a further understanding. And what the author hopes is: hurry up and read "Random Talks on Greece," and after reading it, you may as well take the opportunity to read all of our author's translations, which he put so much effort into: "The Persians," "Prometheus," "Oedipus Rex," "Iphigenia," "Medea," "The Trojan Women" (Greek tragedies above), "The Clouds" (Greek drama above). All are published by Commercial Press.</p>
<p>In addition, our author also has a new collection of poems "Dragon Saliva" (published by Shanghai Times Company before the war), which is also worth noting, especially in that environment where everyone dared to be angry but dared not speak out, he boldly and blatantly used Greek mythology as if counting his family treasures to develop "anti-Japanese" thoughts and feelings. In short, in addition to the recent "Hibiscus City," our author's creations, translations, and narratives are completely integrated, and the inspiration that ancient Greece has bestowed on him is always active, which is gratifying and admirable.</p>

<p>Whether it is sympathy or indifference, praise or blame, both will lead readers into confusion. — Goethe</p>
<p>Embrace the criticisms given to you by critics. They are often glory in disguise. — Shaw Bernard</p>
<p>The critic's gaze is like a microscope, only seeing extremely small things. It discovers atoms and dust, extremely small particles, but cannot see the whole of one thing, cannot compare the parts of one thing, and cannot appreciate the harmony and beauty of each part. — Pope</p>
<p>It is simply amazing how critics lack an attitude of humility. — Helps</p>
<h3>Author's Royalties in Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Hua Mei</p>
<p>In European and American countries, if a famous writer succeeds, he can get a lot of remuneration. Recently, an American publisher paid Hall Caine 60,000 gold pounds as royalties for his book "The Life of Christ." Although he is not as good as former British Prime Minister Lloyd George (Lloyd George), whose book can get royalties of 100,000 pounds, it is already a considerable amount.</p>
<p>Many writers think that writing is originally a business with no capital, so the amount of royalties is irrelevant. For example, the female writer Austen (Jane Austin) only received 150 pounds for Sense&amp;Sesibility. Hume (Fergus Hume) made a book Mys-tery of A Hansom Cab, and the bookstore owner promised him 50 pounds, so he sold the copyright. As a result, this book sold 500,000 copies, so he had to watch it. It was too late to regret it.</p>
<p>However, monetary rewards are not enough to affect an author's reputation and status in the literary world. Taking Shakespeare as an example, his annual income was only 30 gold pounds, while the modern playwright Noel Coward has as much as 50,000 pounds. Similarly, it is also the case for composers. The famous 19th-century composer Molart was subjected to the King of Prussia, with an annual salary of 40 to 50 pounds, while the 20th-century Menuhin (Ve-hudi Menuhin) got 100,000 pounds a year from the MGM company, but he still refused to go.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation in each era is very different. Molart was also a realistic person. He once said: "What I produce in a year is not worth 80 pounds, but in fact I may produce works worth more than 80 pounds." For example, Macaulay wrote a history of England, spending a full five years, and received a reward of 20,000 gold pounds. Later, Wells (H. G. Wells) also wrote a history of England and received 70,000 gold pounds.</p>
<p>There are also many people who get very considerable royalties every year, but they are still in debt, and this debt is repaid by royalties. For example, Wallace ( Wallace) was still in debt of 100,000 pounds when he died, but in a few years, the debt had already been cleared. His descendants can continue to live on their grandfather's rich royalties, and have maintained it for quite some time.</p>
<p>Most writers are very poor and have little income before they become famous. For example, Charles Dickens (Charles Dickens) sold each chapter of Pickwick for 20 gold pounds, but before he died, his book was worth 30,000 pounds. The one who made the Travels of Wanlifo, Jonathan Swift (Jonathan Swift) got only 200 pounds in royalties, but that was his first full-length debut work. And the first time I got royalties from writing. Swift's unfortunate situation in his life can be imagined.</p>
<p>The famous poet Kipling (Kipling) can get 100 pounds in royalties for each poem. Conan Doyle (Coman Doyle) got 7,000 gold pounds for the Sherlock Holmes case. Law Wallace received 40,000 gold pounds from the book Ben-Hur, and Sir Walter Scott wrote for five years and received a total of 200,000 gold pounds.</p>
<p>Hugo (Victor Hugo) received a total of 160,000 pounds in royalties for his writing life.</p>
<p>The above are of course relatively famous writers. Ordinary writers are very lucky to get 1,000 gold pounds in royalties for a book that took two years to write. A debut work can probably be sold for 30 gold pounds, and a history or biography can be sold for 100 gold pounds, but it is also very difficult to get a publisher to adopt it, unless the content of his article describes is of special historical value, or it even alludes to a kind of official secret, the publisher dares to adopt it boldly.</p>
<p>After reading the treatment of European and American writers, and then looking back at the treatment of Chinese writers, we feel that it is really a world of difference.</p>
<p>The reason for this is probably because there are too many illiterate people in China, and the sales of publications are not very guaranteed, so bookstore owners do not dare to spend a lot of money to buy literary works, so writers who live by selling literature are unlucky. There is no such phenomenon in Europe and America. Their education is universal, their culture develops quickly, and the people's purchasing power is high, so the lives of European and American writers are much better than those of Chinese writers. I hope that China will be able to catch up with Europe and the United States in ten years. Under the leadership of our wise Chairman Chiang, we will start a new cultural life until we achieve our goal! When that time comes, I will write another article "Royalties of Chinese Writers" to today "strengthen others' ambitions and reduce our own prestige." Goodbye! We want to drive away the poverty of Chinese writers.</p>
<h3>The Art of Reading</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun Edits</p>
<p>If you cannot recite a book, you cannot achieve the effect of thinking; if you do not think carefully about a book, you cannot get the benefit of understanding the meaning. — Hu Dayuan</p>
<p>The most fearful thing in reading is complacency. — Xu Heng</p>
<p>Whenever I read history, when I got halfway through, I would close the book and think about it, predicting its success or failure. Then I would look back, and if there was anything that did not agree, I would think more carefully. There were many times when I was lucky and it succeeded, and when I was unlucky and it changed. Today, when I only see those who succeed, I think they are right; when I see those who fail, I think they are wrong. I don't know that those who succeed have things that are not right, and those who fail have things that are right. — Cheng Zi</p>
<p>When reading books on philosophy: be happy with the Dao of Zhuangzi, and be self-disciplined with the Dao of Xunzi. — Zeng Guofan</p>
<p>Family affairs are troubling, and I have not been able to read with one mind, but I have set a curriculum and take the time to do it every day, without interruption. After a long time, I will definitely gain something. — Chen Hongke</p>
