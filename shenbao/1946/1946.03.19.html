<h3>總裁勗勉全體中委　協助政府完成任務</h3>
<p>〔中央社車慶十八日電〕蔣總裁今出席中樞紀念週，在渝中委全體參加，總裁領導行禮如儀後，即席致詞，首謂：此次二中全會會期甚長，各位同志在會中集思廣益，對當前政治·經濟之革新與建設，貢獻許多意見，提出具體方案，今茲會議閉幕，尙望各位領導全黨同志，協助政府，切實執行，以完成此次全會之任務。繼更勗勉各委員集中意志，整飭生活，遵守黨的紀律，發揚革命精神，爲全黨同志倡導，爲社會民衆服務，對黨國作實際之報效，以完成吾人革命之使命。</p>
<h3>中央委員當選　國大代表名單</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕二中全會十七日上午舉行第十九次大會時，主席宣吿中委充任國大代表，十六日之選舉結果，當選代表一四九人，候補代表五十人，名單如下：梁寒操·陳誠·孫科。張道藩，陳立夫，白崇禧。蔣宋美齡·于右任·何應欽·谷正綱·陳逸雲·吳敬恒·張繼·吳鐵城·劉健羣；　魯·麥斯武德·張治中·伍智梅·戴傳賢·陳果夫·宋慶齡·居正·賀衷寒·王寵惠·王雋英·潘公展·朱家驊·劉文島·張厲生·賴璉·黃宇八·蕭同茲·余井塘·劉蘅靜·甘乃光·方治·邵力子·程天放·李宗黃·呂雲章·段錫朋·王正廷·陳布雷·傅作義·洪蘭友·張强·傅岩·方覺慧·任卓宣·蕭錚·谷正鼎·沈慧蓮·黃季陸·范予遂·苗培成·鄧飛黃·鄧文儀·李敬齋·田崐山·宋子文·羅翼中·彭昭賢·柳克述·鄒志奮·黃少谷·蕭吉珊·孔祥熙·鹿鍾麟·張九如·王啓江·李惟果·張維楨·魯蕩平·鍾天心·呂曉道·胡秋原·周柏敏·邵華·堯樂博士·張知本·葉秀峯·薛篤弼·朱　靑·李宗仁·鄭彥棨·程潛·馬超俊·張羣·王秉鈞·姚大海·劉瑤章·洪陸東。傅汝霖·錢用和·白海風·張發奎·趙棣華·陳泮嶺·李文範·何成濬·余俊賢·鄧家彥·丁惟汾·劉斐·劉維熾·程中行·唐縱·龐鏡塘·馬星野·狄膺·崔震華·張默君·李濟琛·陳慶雲·程思遠·羅家倫·曾擴情·陳劍如·羅翼羣·李嗣璁·倪文亞·王世杰·張鎭·吳開先·趙允義·許紹棣·陳策·羅貢華·蔣鼎文·宋宜山·賀耀祖·王泉笙·張淸源·馮玉祥·鄭亦同·吳國楨·朱紹良·王星　·李揚敬·雷震·傅啓學·薛岳·吳尙鷹·齊世英·秦德純·林彬·袁雍·彭學沛·候補代表委員名單：陳樹人·于望德·陳雪屏·胡文燦·于學忠·陳方·張任民·宋述樵·高宗禹·李廷年·何聯奎·陸幼剛·黃旭初·陳訪先·孫連仲·徐堪李漢魂·鄧靑陽·王子壯·林雲陔·黃紹竑·馬繼周·吳忠信·何浩若·黃麟書·兪鴻鈞·李任仁·陳耀垣·韋永成·張之江。聞亦有。謝作民·張軫·張鈁·譚伯羽·吳經熊·胡宗南·劉紀文·顧維鈞·李冀中·周兆棠·孫蔚如·兪飛鵬·曾養甫·李樹森·劉攻芸·陳濟棠·傅秉常·熊克武·徐景唐。</p>
<h3>安慶江陰間　將恢復夜航</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十七日電〕長江區航政局，頃召集有關機關會商改善航務，決先在安慶至江陰間恢復夜航，刻正增撥船隻。</p>
<h3>政府短期內改組　毛澤東將出席國府委會　共黨中全會正準備召開</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十八日電〕一般人士預料，政府改組將在短期內實行。據可靠消息，國府委員會改組時，中共將獲委員八席，以毛澤東爲首，屆時毛氏將來渝出席該委員會，周恩來則將人行政院，究竟長何部會，尙未決定：盛傳行政院或將大加擴充，添設勞工·鐵道·實業等八部，報載民主同　已派定代表張瀾·張君勱·沈鈞儒·章伯鈞·黃炎培·羅隆基六人，於政府改組時加入。又據北平來訊，該市參政員已決定提議遷都北平。此項問題將由國大議決，數國大使館已向國府探詢此事，未獲確切答覆。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安十七日電〕此問一般意見咸謂，蔣主席在今後若干時期中，仍將繼續留任爲中國總統，外間相反之傳說恐難成事實。共產黨人士以爲蔣主席實爲必需之一種穩定勢力。民主同盟領袖梁漱溟稱：在聯合政府過渡時期中，蔣主席將仍主中樞，此時期至少須十個月，蔣主席最近演說，曾謂其工作已告完成，外間因此頗多誤會。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國民黨二中全會甫在重慶閉幕，共產黨中全會亦擬跟踪召開。日期預料當在下星期周恩來自重慶歸來之後，中共中央委員共四十四人，現散處全國各地。其中若干人現任軍事調處執行小組代表，若干人係從事於組織立憲新政府之工作，若千人則遠在東北，不能及時趕回，故各委員似難全部出席會議。中央政府已撥運輸機兩架，專供共黨接送代表之用，中全會開會後，將討論最近數月內各項重大發展，並決定若干內部問題，如是否擴充黨員及共黨總部自延安遷往南京等問題。</p>
<h3>全會宣方（續）</h3>
<p>第四，要求貫澈軍隊國家化，以立和平統一的基礎。軍隊國家化是政治民主化的主要條件，惟有軍隊國家化，眾令政令能够貫澈，國家獲得了名實相符的統一，纔可以眞正實現民主。武力割據，是反民主的，任何國家，都不應該有這種現象。如果軍令政令不能統一，地方秩序到處擾亂，人民最期待的安居樂業，尙無保障，何從實施建設，政府所頒佈的停止軍事衝突，恢復交通的命令，以及最近軍事三人小組所議定的整軍和統編方案，必須全國一律遵守，全部貫澈，纔不負我國爲國忍讓，以求和平團結的苦心，纔可使飽經痛苦的同胞，獲得一個休養生息的機會。本會議檢討當前的事實，不得不堅決要求中共部隊，即速停止繼續攻襲和妨礙統一的行動，使和平建國的工作得以順利進行，而實行民主，纔不致徒託空言。〔未完〕</p>
<h3>我國將組訓　航空童軍團</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕中國童軍總會訓練處長袁礪澤，頃由渝來京，即轉浙皖各地，督導童軍復員事宜。據談：中國即擬組訓航空童軍團，俾有志航空事業之童軍，接受航空基本訓練。</p>
<h3>雨天迎端納</h3>
<p>— 本報記者凱蒂</p>
<p>他，七十一歲的高齡，肺部生了一個羣醫束手的癌；就是這樣的他，請求着來，最后一次來看一看所鍾愛的勝利后的中國。</p>
<p>昨天正午十二點鐘，一架從檀香山起飛的美國海軍專機，在泥濘不堪的江灣機塲降落，這是一只不平常的飛機，最新式的C54型，有臥室，有浴間，有牀舖，有看護，有醫生……而且，它還帶來了一位不平常的乘客——中國的首席客卿，端納先生。</p>
<p>陪伴他來的，是前宣傳部副部長董顯光。戰地服務團的黃仁霖將軍，飛虎將軍陳納德，都在機塲迎候。當記者走上這架豪華舒適的飛機時，端納先生正在和陳納德將軍談天。中國最早和最新的兩位客卿間洋溢着無上的友誼和溫悄，記者深深的爲這眞摯動人的景象感動了。</p>
<p>端納先生穿着灰呢的西服，卡嘰布的雨衣，因爲是從夏威夷來，所以還帶了一頂草帽，這是一位曾經隻手轉捩了中國歷史的人物，然而，他已經疲倦了。他的面色非常憔悴，和記者握手之後，也不像以前那樣滔滔多辯的健談。陳納德將軍和一位醫生把他扶下飛機，美國海軍的攝影員爲這位素來不喜歡照相的貴賓拍了許多照片。黃仁霖將軍本來爲他預備了一輛救護軍，但他總於坐了陳納德將軍的汽車，在機塲上一片無涯無限的泥淖上，好容易揀出一條勉强可以行軍的小這，繞到機塲門口，再換黃將軍的車，由董黃二氏伴至宏恩醫院第三百號病室休息。</p>
<p>他的肺部生了一個癌！誠然，在美國，他一定可以得到更好的療養，但是這位七十一歲商齡而且病入膏肓的長者，他自己請求蔣主席和蔣夫人，要在這還沒有太遲的時候，看一看他所鍾愛的，勝利的中國！</p>
<p>主席和夫人特爲請董顯光氏到檀香山去接他。美國海軍立刻答應派遣一架舒服的飛機給他乘坐。黃仁霖將軍奉主席特諭在滬照料，因之在機塲上睡了兩夜，等候這架飛機。記者也一連到江灣機塲去迎接了三夜。因爲記者深知端納先生雖然特爲掙扎着飛過了半個太平洋來到上海，但是，夕陽無限，記者不知道再能見他幾面！也許，在他的一生之中，記者竟是他最後見到的一個新聞記者了。　端納先生是澳洲人，本來是一位新聞記者，早年就奉派爲紐約前錄報駐中國記者，後來到了香港，任「德臣西報」的總編輯。</p>
<p>在道個做報人的時期，端納最有歷史性的傑作是揭發日本向中國所提的「二十一條」。這時候，端納在滬任「遠東評論」主筆，「二十一條」的全部內容及日本的野心，是由「遠東評論」首先暴露，因之日人恨之入骨。</p>
<p>在一九一五年（民國六年）孫總理想找一個英文助手，就便邀請端納主持其事，從此以後，這個澳洲的新聞記者就成了中國近代歷史上神秘的人物。</p>
<p>一九二七年，（民國十六年），端納任張作霖的顧問，跟着又任張學良的顧問，由張學良的介紹，又作了蔣主席的幕僚。</p>
<p>這許多年中，他鼓吹着推翻滿淸，他事實上也帮助了討袁之役，他也促成了張學良的服膺中央，完成了南北統一。但是他最足以彪炳史册的一件大功，却是在西安事變中的努力。關於這一件事，大家想都很淸楚了。　戰爭開始，日本兵把他送進了馬尼拉的集中營，高年幽囚，終於得了全世界醫師所最怕的癌症。勝利之後，他在塔希底島休養了一個時期，再到檀香山，和以前上海英文大美晚報的編輯沙萊（Earle　Salle）相遇，然而沙萊已經失明了。端納先生覺得已經是該寫回憶錄的時候，便和沙萊合作，請他整理了材料寫出來。幾十年來的幕後工作，使他成爲知道中國秘密最多的人，他的回憶錄無疑的將是民國以來最有價値的史料，因爲他自己就造成了一部份歷史。</p>
<p>他的眼光還是奕奕有神，他的語言還是淸晣，他握手的時候還是充滿了熱力，他的神態也並不比記者十二年前在和他晤面時更爲蒼老，然而——他知道在自己的肺部生了一個羣醫束手的「癌」！</p>
<p>有人說他不肯吃中國菜，說他念蔣主席的名字時說得不像中國音，不懂中國脾氣，以外國人的觀點來處理中國事務。但是，這位風燭殘年身患絕症的「外國人」，却始終沒有忘掉中國，而且是這樣眞摯的鍾愛中國！但願醫藥界再來一個奇跡，讓他早早康復罷！</p>
<h3>陳逆公博十大罪狀　蘇州高等法院昨提起公訴</h3>

<h3>政府顧問白蘭福德　已自美啓程來華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐的十七日電〕紐約時報據接近政府方面消息称：數星期前杜魯門總統任命重整中國預算之白蘭福德氏，其所負責任，將較任命狀原來指定者爲廣泛。據稱：白氏於星期日乘機自華盛頓飛往中國，將負「實際改組中國政府之責，同時渠之決策或將影響中國人民之社會生活及經濟前途」。該報謂，預料白氏將以美國之民主思想灌輸於中國之政制，「將其重加調整，以配合中國古代之哲理及方法，作爲渠建設行政及財政計劃之一部分工作」。白氏之正式資格，雖爲中國政府顧問，『其任務將包括全國性的都市設計者之多方面工作」。白氏於起程前接見紐的時報記者時，承認上述各點稱：『余承認余將協助中國之事項，其範圍將較重整中國預算爲廣泛。余將儘量利用余在行政或政府組織方面之經騐，至余究將進行何種特殊工作，則須由中國政府之意向以決定之」。</p>

<h3>社論　東北局勢需要鎭靜</h3>
<p>自蘇軍撤離瀋陽以來，東北的局勢，仍爲陰　所籠罩，迄未達到如期的明朗。最近從東北來的消息，也相當混亂。據本報十七日北平電，謂東北局勢仍極混沌，中共軍隊有以李兆麟案進入哈爾濱甚至長春之可能。一般判斷，馬歇爾與杜魯門會商後，中美兩國重大之外交行動，即可決定開始；熊式輝刻在錦應付瞬息萬變之複雜情勢。……重慶方面雖有軍事三人小組對東北問題已獲協議之訊，惟此間調處部尙未接到任何具體指示，似一般言之，軍事三人小組，如能對東北廣泛問題，獲得協議，則東北問題之嚴重性，當可减輕。另據本報十七日北平電，則謂李兆麟之死，已予東北現局，拋一新炸彈，此新炸彈將爲東北即有颶風之吼號，有謂某方欲岡以此冲淡抵消張莘夫案者，但中共發行之解放三日刋，則堅稱此係中國反動派反蘇反共之陰謀。從上面這些報道，可知蘇軍之撤離瀋陽，尙不足以澄淸東北的同勢。</p>
<p>在華盛頓，馬歇爾元帥於抵達美京之後，在記者招待會席次，曾言：「東北局勢極端嚴重」，「千鈞一髮」，又謂：「在余留華之最後一個晚上，直至余動身前之十分鐘，我等尙在關於遣派執行小組前往東北作成協議…在東九省內迄今尙無執行總部之代表，該處情形變動甚速，軍隊到處　動，當然難免各種小衝突。此等軍隊，尤其在共黨方面，幾不知吾等已成立協議，因此，吾人必須速即派執行小組前往東北。」從馬歇爾元帥的率直談吐中，他不曾低估東北局勢的嚴重性，却給東北局勢以一種平衡的描述。此在澄淸東北局勢的努力上，實是大有裨益的。</p>
<p>可是陰霾混沌終有澄淸的一日，今日東北局勢的嚴重，我們尤應知所自處。過去一月來全國民情的激昂。不特足以表示人民對東北局勢的關心，抑亦爲我民族生命充沛有力的表徵。然而民情的激昂，未必能於率態的解次有何積極的帮助，在若干情形之下，有時且足以妨礙事態的解次。我們不能容許錯誤。今日東北局勢的嚴重是衆所周知的事；嚴重局勢的打開以至消除需要我們的鎭靜與沈着。蔣主席對於東北局勢曾一再有所闡述，最近召開的國民黨二中全會，對東北局勢亦有嚴密的檢討，並有次議以尊重本國主權及維持持世界和平爲原則，建立中蘇眞正友誼。可知我政府自蔣主席以次正在竭其智慮，以謀東北局勢的解次。我們對於政府應該有信任，不應使政府增加困難。所以關於東北局勢，我們不能再容激動情感，應沈着鎭靜聽候政府的措施與解次。</p>
<p>況且關於東北問題，我們的盟邦亦正在設法打開。英美後先向蘇聯所致的照會，表示英美對打開東北的局勢如何關注。東北問題之所以有現階段的姿態出現，原有國際關係存在其間。則關於東北問題的解次，有我們盟邦的協力，總可以達到圓滿解次的境地。我們在這時需要壓制我們的情感，免使這已趨於嚴重的局勢增加其嚴重，就東北問題的國際關係上言，像馬歇爾元帥這樣的人物都不諱言局勢的嚴重。可知盟國人士對東北局勢之有正確的認識；有了正確的認識，纔能爲適常的解次·東北問題是一個國際問題，只要國際人士對此局勢有正確的認識，這問題終不難爲適常之解次。這是我們需要沈着鎮靜的又一點。</p>
<p>蔣主席在國民黨二中全會閉幕詞裏，說到我們必須以互諒互讓的請神來解決目前的紛爭。主席於提到馬歇爾元帥的貢獻以後，還說到：「我們的盟友對中國的和平統一，尙且如此熟心關切，何况我們自己的同胞，常然應該捐棄任何成見，顧全整個中國的前途，貫澈和平統一的目的。我希望中國共產黨能與我們政府一樣的眞誠接受盟邦友人的一片好意。對於議定的方案，忠實履行，勿作軌外的行動，勿生意外的枝節；那我相信馬歇爾將軍的使命一定可以如期成功的」。在東北局勢嚴重下的今日，蔣主席這一篇閉幕詞，意味尤爲深長。在東北的共黨軍隊以及中國共產黨，我們允願他們對　主席這番話，深深有所體會。互諒互讓需要容忍，對東北局勢，這又是需要我們沉着鎭靜的一點。</p>
<h3>美採用最新式之Ｐ２Ｖ型機</h3>
<p>航程遠速率高火力強　用以維持法律與秩序</p>
<p>〔路透社好萊塢十八日電〕美國海軍部宣布：採用新式Ｐ２Ｖ型和平巡邏機，維持美國各重要區城之法律與秧序。此等飛機工程設計悉爲最新式者，載重量及航程，堪與B17型飛行堡壘及B24型解放式超級機相埒。陸海軍工程師設計二年又半，始完成此航程最遠，連　最高，火力最强之巡　機。譬如基地設在關島之P2V型機，可至　克島。東京。馬尼刺。拉布爾等作不　巡飛行。基地設在馬尼刺者，可環飛新加坡。上海。河內等地。此等飛機可作五千哩以上之不停飛行，故如自紐約至夏威夷，自東京至西雅圖，自華盛頓至英斯科，均可不停飛行，中途毋須加油。最高速率每小時三百餘哩，普通速率亦在每小時三百哩以上。機上其有完備之電達設備，及原子彈放射器，頃刻之間即可成爲無敵之轟炸機。該機之翼長機身長，盡載彈量，與飛行堡壘相近。裝有巨潑萊斯式發動機二具，馬力共四千六百匹，滿載時之航程爲三千五百哩，平時航程在五千哩以上，超過飛行堡壘之航程的百分之五十，可與制日本於　命之B29型機相比。P2V型機全重五八〇〇〇磅，其效力則在四引擎飛機之上，發動機形式改良後視之，較B29型機之發動機爲小。</p>

<p>美國敎育最近趨勢</p>

<h3>暨南發生學潮</h3>
<p>傖父二字引起誤會</p>
<p>〔大華社建陽訊〕國立暨南大學，前因該校文學院敎授魏應麟，上課時，在「世說新語」中解釋「傖父」二字，謂「偷父」乃從前南方人稱北方之意，與上海人所謂江北佬相同。詎料引起兩位蘇北同學之誤會，當經提出質問。</p>
<p>暴動　經魏氏解釋后，原已告平息，惟下課後，校內一部份學生，受平時與魏氏意見不合之敎授及學生慫恿，發動組織「護校委員會」，而校內各處，忽發現「打倒魏應麟」之標語。及至次晚，此輩學生乃湧至魏氏住宅，加以搗毀。而校內另一部份學生，反對此種行為，亦發動組「護校團」，相與對抗。時並查悉主使搗魏宅者，為另一敎授盧懷道，羣情大　，遂亦湧至盧氏住宅加以搗毀。至是雙方學生，勢成相持，全校罷課</p>

<h3>銀樓門兌告旺　金價略見上漲　中行仍繼紀配售</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以前日報載美議員王張提高黃金收買價之訊，引起一般民間購金浮動信念，各小銀樓門兌吿旺，昨市開出即有補進，（事實上本市黃金業已做高至八十元對一兩以上），晨開即跳高至一七〇萬光景，業中稍明事理者，軫機脫售，俄頃即退至一六五萬左右，始起掙扎，十時後在一六四萬以下盤旋，中行配售同業三九〇條，價一六二萬，最低亦見此價，午刻甚爲平穩，站定於一六四萬光景，午後仍有零星實銷，交易雖屬有限，市價則稍稍做高至一六六萬左右，結果較上週六好起六萬左右，銀樓飾命掛十八萬元，紋銀一千六，銀元八七〇元有賣，銀根平平，暗息自一角八至二角二分不等，投機商方面頭寸較外行見緊。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔平庸，初開二〇五〇元左右，金市回挫，遂稍降至二〇三〇元光景徘徊，午刻及午後始終穩而靜，結果較上週六回好十五元，港票一度報俏，最後老貨穩而新貨轉疲，（港地新貨對老貨退至二九折），老貨曾升至四四〇元買進，新貨始終未能越過週六高價，結果老貨再升五元，新貨回跌三元，美匯未更，港電四五〇元，羅比五五〇元。</p>
<h3>華股多頭了結　外股乘機活躍</h3>

<h3>商業銀行復員　已有補充辦法</h3>

<h3>美國金價問題　礦主要求提高　國會不易通過</h3>
<p>〔路透社科羅多州丹佛十八日電〕美國現正逐漸恢復開採金鑛。去年產量爲一八四七年以來最小之產量，計純金九十六萬七千盎司。按一九四四年爲九十九萬五千盎司，一九四〇年計六百零零三千盎司，爲歷年來之最商紀錄（包括菲律濱在內）。以價値計，一九四五年値美金三千四百萬元，一九四〇年爲二萬一千萬元。美國主要金鑛，自一九四二年十月至一九四五年七月一日，全部停閉。自去年七月間停閉命令取消後，黃金產量逐漸增加，但美國所產黃金五分之四爲普通金屬鑛之副產物，此等普通金屬鑛，因材料及人工缺乏而受阻碍。且金價固定不變，而一般物價逐漸高漲，生產成本隨之增加，致採鑛者咸裏足不前。產金各州之生產者及國會議員，除設法補償戰時停頓期間之損失外，促請當局通過法案，規定下列各項：（一）予以特種無息政府借款（以未來之產量爲担保，不以鑛山本身爲担保）；（二）將金價提高至每盎司五十六元；（三）給與美國金鑛開採商以每盎司十元補助金；或（四）准許金鑛開採商以最惠價格，出售黃金於世界各地，即得在世界市塲上自由買賣。然以上各點欲得國會之通過，希望極微。</p>

<h3>紗市平淡　現棉交易進展</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍極平庸，客銷依然寥寥，人心亦殊淡漠，故起伏甚狹，結果與上週末行市無榮無辱，紡建公司午時照例掛牌，供售自一支起至六十支止，有二十種之多，久未開售之廿支紗，昨日已有廿支四季大發標售，每包價開一百萬元，較市塲上成交價雖低若干，然至快須五天後后能出到現貨云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉漲跌不一，上下二至九磅音，計近期美金二六·六二，遠期二六·三九，米特林現貨二七·二二，本埠現棉市况堅定，交易亦見進展，緣民營紗廠如申新一六九等應相繼採辦，綜計成交一千二三百包，惟紡建公司仍在觀望。</p>

<p>帽子旣具位格性，區分了一人」與一不是人」，當然也區分「人」與「人上人」。於是，戴起一頂高高的禮帽的人物，就被推爲「紳士七」了。至少，當着厠所前掛的那塊“Gertieman”的牌子，你可以坦然無愧了。</p>
<p>高帽子也許是一個抽象的東西，但是落到頭上就會覺得非常具體似地。所以，帽子儘高儘大，戴者總有其人；即使某一種人頭部的負荷力並不頂强，奇怪的，任憑帽子高戴如塔，不惟累贅毫無，反而感到一陣子輕鬆，舒適，而至飄飄然！很有一天不戴高帽，一天幾乎過不了癮的。</p>
<p>「心理是市塲的靈魂」。有人求，自然有人供，因此高帽子就頂快的成了處世哲學「熱門貨」之一。任何時，任何地，任何人物，給他捧上一頂高帽子，總是上上大吉的。他可能對你有好印象；你可能對他有新收獲！</p>
<p>聰明的人們，當他把這頂神秘的帽子戴在別人頭頂上時，他也許晴暗地忖着：「怎麼，居然有人喜歡這虛幻的東西？」但當另一個人把高帽子同樣套在他頭上時，他又服服貼貼地感到「落胃」！</p>
<p>人是攪不過矛盾的。愈是矛盾的，愈樂於在那裏打轉。這樣，纔使高帽子在矛盾圈內欣欣向榮，而生而長。</p>
<p>一位紳士招呼一輛洋車，正待談判軍資，車夫就捧出高帽子來：「談什麼！您先生難道還會小給嗎？」拉了半程，紳士也還他一頂：「瞧你這股樣兒，跑得可怪有勁啦！」結果，紳士坐了速度、於汽車的洋車，車夫得了代價等於汽車的車資，皆大歡喜！</p>
<p>互戴高帽，互受其惠！矛盾在此，妙用也在此！</p>
<p>如果人們還是那麼驕傲，就更多的愚昧，會被人們常作更多的智慧！</p>
<p>看樣子，高帽子的前途仍是相當光明的。</p>

<h3>春在揚州</h3>
<p>— 魯蕪</p>
<p>勝利後到現在已快半年了，揚州的日本蘇北駐屯軍，已被繳械送入新南門的集中營，苛捐擾民的孫良誠部隊，已經調往安徽。人們瘋在歡迎國軍的熱潮，漸漸地冷淡，街頭巷尾的紅綠標語，大幅壁畫，也都給無情的風雨日光剝蝕，祇剩了片片殘痕。隨着春的來臨，帶給縣城的老百姓的，是流離失所，苛捐雜稅，常地駐軍的供應，縣政府的徵借，物價高漲，這一連串的威脅人民的痛苦……可憐的蘇北！</p>
<p>揚州的摧殘，雖比不上閩北桂柳等地，但你徘徊從前鹽商們的住宅，還只見敗瓦頹垣，昔日高樓巨厦，已蕩然無存。城北風景區的花草樹木，已砍伐一空，而所謂瘦西湖也者，也祇是一汪吳水而已。「綠楊城郭」成了歷史上的一個名詞，留給讀史的人去憑吊吧！城的四週，深溝壁區，荷鎗實彈的守城衛士，又儼然是身臨大敵。縣城的居民，就在這提心吊膽緊張的形勢中，渡過了殘冬，現在是春天了，讓陽光來普照溫暖每個人吧！</p>
<p>在蘇北十幾縣中，沒有一處沒有被敵人的鐵騎踐踏過，死于砲火者，不知凡幾，尤以農村最慘。只要你深入四鄕，就會明瞭農民生活之苦。佔計能以糙米充飢的，已是一村首富了。普通農民，衣不蔽體，一年辛苦，不够償付軍米。平日以雜糧充飢，甚至棄家逃亡者，大有人在。目前善後救濟總署亦未聞將蘇北列入救濟範圍，蘇北是被遣忘了！</p>
<p>揚州的商業，尙廊繁榮，麵粉廠已復業，祇供給當地軍隊之需，發電廠雖已恢復電流，唯燒煤不足，光綫陪淡，電費每度需法幣六百元，普通之家，實不堪負擔。其他物價，遠較上海爲貴，且以米爲例，往昔蘇北爲江蘇穀倉，近年以來，米糧不能遝入城中接濟，縣城食糧全恃江南轍入，米價已高漲至三萬多一石，民生疾苦，危機重重！</p>
<p>談到揚州縣政，在過去敵僞時代，除了保甲辦得差强人意外，其他無一足述。而現在的政府，也不過重抄老文章，衛生事業公共建設，毫不講求，儘管垃圾滿地，臭氣四溢，而『居住證」却辦得起勁。敎育方面，因納就簡，敎員還剛領到今年一月份薪水，枵腹從公，作育英才之精神，令人肅然起敬！</p>
<p>春節以來，物價飛騰，金價當先，米價緊隨于後，囤積操縱，無奇不有，影響所及，商店提早打烊，或則隱匿不賣。是以窮者愈窮，富者愈富，勝利帶給人們的禮物，是『生活威脅』，贍念前途，實難想像！</p>
<p>春在揚州，但揚州人們何嘗嗅着春的氣息？多少貧窮，多少流離，多少徬徨，浩浩長江，靄靈白雲，像徵了蘇北居民的痛苦，綿綿不斷！</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>「沒有辦法」嗎？</h3>
<p>— 洪一木</p>
<p>『沒有辦法』這句話，我聽得太熟了，尤其是向上級機關或上官請求什麼的時候。</p>
<p>本來一件事情或一個問題發生了，要設法去解決，常然須費一翻思索，一翻考慮，有時還要傷很多的腦筋。若把「沒有辦法」四個字去搪塞，就减少許多麻煩。這是應付主義者的處世法寳</p>
<p>「沒有辦法」四個字是思想的麻醉劑，是進步的障碍物。它遮蔽了無限光明，截斷了人生大道。凡事都者做沒有辦法的人，一定是自暴自棄的落伍者，他永遠沒有前途，永遠沒有幸福，拿破崙的字典裏沒有「難」字，意思就是凡事從沒有辦法之中去想出辦法來。</p>
<p>相反的，一種眞正「沒有辦法」的事，若是硬說有辦法，那也是一個傻瓜。軍閥的武力統一，官僚的黑陪專制，希特勒等的征服世界，這些夢想，在他們失敗以前的一剎那間，何嘗不是自稱爲有辦法呢？</p>
<p>現在京滬路火車站買票的客人擁擠不堪，衣服撕破了，鞋子踏掉了，帶着行李貨物的人更是不堪設想，非起隊來，行李無處放，一排就是三四固鐘頭，大小便也不能去解，一離開就要遭受『落伍』的危險，沒有一個人不爲之長吁短嘆的。</p>
<p>我嘗問車站的管理人，爲什麼不設法改良呢？他們答的總是人數太多「沒有辦法。」我想辦法，是有的，還是你們不想去辦。第一個辦法是延長售票時間，上班車開後就賣下班軍的票，來一個賣一張，不是很好嗎？何必和看電影一樣等人到齊了才『開幕」呢？第二個辦法是多開幾個售票窗戶，售票的地方多，可以减少擁擠。若是說人力不經濟的話，那成千的人排隊等買票就經濟嗎？這些辦法不去辦，而反說「沒有辦法，」這種人我眞對他「沒有辦法」！</p>
<p>諸如此類的例子很多。如物價高漲呀，公務員生活困難呀，貪官汚吏橫行呀，農村經濟破產呀，這些都是一般人認爲「沒有辦法」的事情。依我看來，若是把政治民主化，把國事作個全盤的計劃，把自私自利的心理收斂一點，把人家的事當作自己的事去做，把國家民族的利益人羣的幸福顧及一下，就可迎刃而解了</p>

<h3>中國天才數數學</h3>
<p>— 王友農</p>
<p>本報前載西南聯大敎授華羅庚，受蘇聯國家科學院之邀請，赴莫斯科講學二月，再由我國軍部派華氏與其他聯大敎授二人，赴美國研究國防科學。華氏的經歷，知者極鮮，茲略記於下：</p>
<p>華氏是江蘇金　縣人，家境很苦。其父設一棉花另售店，勉能維持生活；所以他在本縣初中畢業後，僅僅到上海中華職業學校，讀了一年，就停學服務於初中母校，担任會計助理。他對算學一科，特別富有興趣；打起珠算，也很熟很快，曾在上海全校珠算競賽時，名列第一。在他的家里，不問是一張舊報紙，或是一個用過的信封，總是給他塗滿了算式。甚至他在吃飯或大便時，都是不停的在那里演算。他靠了刻苦自修和不恥下問的工夫，雖僅是初中畢業的程度，什麼大代數，微積分，解析幾何，不問是日文本西文本，都能精通熟習，眞是一個天才的算學怪傑。大學生有疑難的題目，在假期回來，都去請敎他，他是無不立刻代爲解答的。</p>
<p>他於民國念二三年的時候，在中國科學社的「科學」雜誌上，發表六次方程式的理論及虛數原理等論文，大受算學界的注意，以爲他至少是一個著名大學的算學系畢業生哩。後來由同鄕某君的介紹，到淸華大學做一假算學系的助理。因他年紀很輕，只有二十四五歲，資格方面，更連助敎都够不上；但算學系的學生，都喜歡和他研究，系主任也漸漸另跟相看了。以後華氏迭有算學理論上的發見，更於抗戰期間，由學校方面，派赴美國研究一些時候，于是他就一直任正敎授到如今。華氏在美時，曾和相對論發明家愛因斯坦等在一起研究過數理，所以在國際方而，也都知道這個年靑的算學怪傑了。</p>
<p>華氏的左腿，拐凸在外，不能直立，行動時成爲搖船式。這是他在二十歲的時候，因臥病的時間很久，在那時依舊看書演算，只知用手和腦，連兩腿都忘記去活動，以致膝蓋骨間，因病菌侵入，而改變了形狀。據協和醫院的醫生說：要鋸繼左腿，重行裝配，才可復原。不知這位年靑算學家，在醫術高明的美國研究時，曾將它治好沒有？</p>
<p>我們看了上述華氏的成爲算學大家，就可知一個人的讀書，不一定要專靠學校敎育，也不一定要有最好的環境；對於任何學問，有了特殊的興趣，只要立志能堅，不怕吃苦，總可有良好結果的。</p>

<h3>建立好風氣</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>一種風氣的義成，一種風氣的改變，甚至一種風氣的消失，無論這是一種好的風氣，或是壞的風氣，都不是一件一蹴即成的事情，而必須費無數的恒心和不斷的努力累積起來方克奏効。也許，人類是惰性的動物，所以對於習慣特別的重視，對於新的環境的創造，却甚至努力去阻止它的成長。儘是，人類的文明一天天在進步，但是，人類社會中的醜惡，却還容留在很多的角落裏。</p>
<p>戰時暴利主義的突起，很使許許多多短視的人們忘記了學問，忘記了道德，趨向於金錢的角逐。風氣是這樣，文人走到了末路，文化工作者成了社會中最不幸的可憐虫。在這種風氣的陶薰中，大衆所討論的就只是致富和發財。</p>
<p>大家都知道，無論今日的官塲，商界，甚至敎育界，文化界，莫不有着重重的黑幕。固然我們不能抹煞許許多多忠貞不屈的人們在苦鬥，但是，我們每一個人都會知造其中也有許許多多不肖的人們在幹着偸天換日的勾當，過着淫佚奢糜的生活。大家都知道這是不對的，但是大家依舊在這樣幹，因為風氣就是這樣，誰不爲自己打算，似乎誰就是　瓜。</p>
<p>一種好的風氣，可以興國家；一種壞的風氣，可以亡國家。大家沉浸在壞的風氣裏，都知道這種風氣不好，足以亡國家，但是大家都沒有勇氣革除，以爲「衆人皆醉我獨醒」，又有什麼用呢，還不是大家糊塗下去吧！——這也許也是一種風氣吧，這種風氣，使大家因循延誤下去。</p>
<p>要國家的政治上，經濟上，文化上，一切的部門上軌道，就必須第一步在各部門建立起好的風氣來。這好風氣的建立，不是一個人一個團體的事情，而是應</p>
<p>壞的風氣是經年累月壞的總結晶，我們應該毫不容情的革除它。好的風氣是經年累月好的總結晶，我們應該小心翼翼的保護它。並且，我們應該竭盡所能，創造新的好風氣！</p>
<p>充塞在社會裏的風氣，有多少是好？有多少是壞？有多少應改？有多少應革？我想，每一個人都一定能明白的吧！但是，光是明白還沒有用處，一定要大家以身作則，努力實現才對。</p>
<h3>社會服務　平價竟演變為黑市</h3>
<p>投機商人任意操縱不顧平民生活　　夫平價麵粉，政府原爲救濟平民，迭經行政院善後救濟總署修正發售，報載平民均有購買之可能，並限價每包爲六千元，法至完善，詎料有投機商人，恃有鉅款，任意操縱，火批購辦，而普遍平民」竟有備款而仍抱向隅之歎者。設有所需，不得不轉向黑市轉購，但每包價在八九千元不等，長此以往，何堪設想！按政府平價救濟之美舉，往往弄巧成拙，完全趨入黑市狀態，一般平民，不能享受福利，如此壟斷，救濟云乎哉？</p>
<p>〔編者按〕近來一般人對於敵產處理局及救濟分署拍賣或平賣日用品的辦法，頗多疵議。因為賣出的大理物資，都被少數投機商人所操縱，而最大多數的平民毫無所得，例如以前所拋售的布。糖。魚。肥皂。麵粉……等不一而足。輿論　然，而當局一意孤行，如今戶口調查，業已完竣，國民身份證，亦頒發有期，此後當以「計口配售」最為公允，最為合理；望市府民政處顧念民困，據理力爭，平民幸甚！</p>

<h3>Reasonable Regulations for Borderland Autonomy: The Mongolian-Tibetan Committee Reorganized as the Ministry of Border Affairs; Recruiting Talents from Three Ethnic Groups to Participate in the Government; Allocating Special Funds to Develop Various Undertakings</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee, at its 19th meeting on the morning of the 17th, passed a supplementary motion on borderland issues. The original text is as follows: It is found that our Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members constituting our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an inseparable part of our territory. Our party has always aimed to support and develop our borderland compatriots, hand in hand, and strive for their common prosperity, strength, and happiness. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, care and comfort have been somewhat lacking, leading to the fact that the wishes of our borderland compatriots may not have been fully realized. Looking back on the past, we cannot help but feel deeply concerned. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the responsibility of nation-building should be jointly borne by all our compatriots. In accordance with this spirit, this conference has carefully reviewed the relevant cases and decided on the following points based on the spirit of the cases and the main points of the reports and reviews, with the hope of their rapid implementation, so as to achieve the unity and solidarity of all ethnic groups in the country and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and security of the country. (1) Under the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution, in order to form a unified and democratic country, the Constitution should have clear provisions guaranteeing the autonomous rights of borderland ethnic groups. (2) The members of the reorganized National Government Committee and the political affairs committee of the Executive Yuan must include loyal and capable comrades from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups. (3) Talented people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have ample opportunities to participate in the actual work of various Yuan, Ministries, and Committees. (4) In the newly added quota of representatives to the National Assembly, the quota of representatives from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups should be appropriately increased, to be selected by the Central Government. (5) Reorganize the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee into the Ministry of Border Affairs, so that capable people from the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups can participate in actual work and assume actual responsibilities. (6) In the education provided in schools at all levels in the borderland ethnic areas, attention should be paid to the languages of the respective ethnic groups, and the national language should be a compulsory subject. The Ministry of Education should consider implementing this. The principle for official documents of agencies at all levels should be to use both the national language and the language of the respective ethnic group. (7) The Central Government must formulate reasonable regulations regarding the autonomous systems in various borderland areas, according to the actual situation of each area: A. Regarding the Inner Mongolia part, restore the original Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee, and clearly delineate the powers and responsibilities between the League/Banner governments and the provincial/county governments. B. Regarding the Xinjiang part, it should be implemented in accordance with the methods determined in the resolution of the Xinjiang Provincial Incident. C. Regarding the Tibetan areas under provincial jurisdiction, they should be given real opportunities to participate in provincial and county politics. (8) Special funds should be allocated for various undertakings in the borderland areas, such as economy, transportation, education, health, and relief, and the relevant competent authorities should be responsible for formulating implementation plans and promoting them rapidly. (9) The National Defense Forces stationed in various borderland ethnic areas should be concentrated in several strategic locations, with food and provisions supplied by the Central Government, without interfering in local administration. All local security forces should be staffed by trained members of the local ethnic groups and people as a principle.</p>
<h3>President Chiang Encourages All Central Executive Committee Members to Assist the Government in Completing its Tasks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] President Chiang attended the Central Memorial Week today, with all Central Executive Committee members in Chongqing participating. After President Chiang led the ceremony, he delivered an impromptu speech, first stating: "This Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee has been lengthy. All comrades have pooled their wisdom in the meeting, contributed many opinions on the current political and economic reforms and construction, and put forward concrete plans. Now that the meeting has concluded, I hope that all of you will lead all Party comrades to assist the government in faithfully implementing these plans in order to complete the tasks of this plenary session." He then further encouraged the members to concentrate their will, rectify their lives, abide by Party discipline, promote the revolutionary spirit, advocate for all Party comrades, serve the people of society, make practical contributions to the Party and the country, and complete our revolutionary mission.</p>
<h3>List of Central Executive Committee Members Elected as National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] At the 19th meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee held on the morning of the 17th, the chairman announced the results of the election of Central Executive Committee members to serve as National Assembly representatives held on the 16th. 149 representatives were elected, and 50 alternate representatives.

It is also heard that Xie Zuomin, Zhang Zhen, Zhang Fang, Tan Boyu, Wu Jingxiong, Hu Zongnan, Liu Jiwen, Gu Weijun, Li Jizhong, Zhou Zhaotang, Sun Weiru, Yu Feipeng, Zeng Yangfu, Li Shusen, Liu Gongyun, Chen Jitang, Fu Bingchang, Xiong Kewu, Xu Jingtang.</p>
<h3>Night Navigation to be Restored Between Anqing and Jiangyin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] The Yangtze River Navigation Administration recently convened a meeting of relevant agencies to discuss improvements in navigation affairs. It was decided to first restore night navigation between Anqing and Jiangyin, and vessels are currently being allocated.</p>
<h3>Government to Reorganize in the Short Term; Mao Zedong to Attend National Government Committee; Communist Party Central Committee Preparing to Convene</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] It is generally expected that the government will be reorganized in the short term. According to reliable sources, when the National Government Committee is reorganized, the CCP will obtain eight seats, headed by Mao Zedong. At that time, Mao will come to Chongqing to attend the committee. Zhou Enlai will enter the Executive Yuan, but it has not been decided which ministry he will head. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan will be greatly expanded, with the addition of eight ministries, including Labor, Railways, and Industry. Reports state that the Democratic League has designated Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji as representatives to join the government during the reorganization. According to a dispatch from Peiping, the councilors of that city have decided to propose moving the capital to Peiping. This matter will be decided by the National Assembly. Several embassies have inquired with the National Government about this matter, but have not received a definite reply.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 17th] General opinion here holds that President Chiang will continue to serve as President of China for some time to come. Contrary rumors are unlikely to materialize. Communist Party figures believe that President Chiang is in fact a necessary stabilizing force. Democratic League leader Liang Shuming stated that during the transitional period of the coalition government, President Chiang will remain at the center. This period should be at least ten months. President Chiang recently said in a speech that his work had been completed, which caused many misunderstandings.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee has just concluded in Chongqing, and the Communist Party Central Committee also intends to convene a meeting. The date is expected to be after Zhou Enlai returns from Chongqing next week. The CCP Central Committee has a total of forty-four members, who are currently scattered throughout the country. Some of them are currently representatives of the military mediation executive group, some are engaged in the work of organizing a new constitutional government, and some are far away in the Northeast and cannot return in time. Therefore, it seems difficult for all members to attend the meeting. The central government has allocated two transport planes specifically for the CCP to pick up and transport representatives. After the Central Committee meeting, it will discuss various major developments in recent months and decide on some internal issues, such as whether to expand party membership and whether the CCP headquarters will move from Yan'an to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Plenary Session (Continued)</h3>
<p>Fourth, we demand the thorough implementation of the nationalization of the military to establish a foundation for peaceful unification. The nationalization of the military is a primary condition for political democratization. Only when the military is nationalized can orders from the central government be thoroughly implemented, the country can achieve unification in name and in reality, and democracy can be truly realized. Warlordism is anti-democratic, and no country should have such a phenomenon. If military and political orders cannot be unified, local order is disrupted everywhere, and the people's most anticipated peaceful and prosperous life is not guaranteed, how can construction be implemented? The government's orders to cease military conflicts and restore transportation, as well as the army organization and integration plan recently agreed upon by the military three-person group, must be uniformly observed and thoroughly implemented throughout the country. Only then will we not fail our country's painstaking efforts to seek peace and unity through tolerance, and only then can we give compatriots who have suffered so much an opportunity to recuperate and rebuild. This conference, in reviewing the current facts, cannot but resolutely demand that the CCP troops immediately cease their continued attacks and actions that hinder unification, so that the work of peaceful nation-building can proceed smoothly, and the implementation of democracy will not be merely empty words.

<h3>Our Country to Organize and Train Aviation Boy Scout Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Yuan Lize, Director of the Training Department of the Boy Scouts of China, recently came to Nanjing from Chongqing and then proceeded to Zhejiang and Anhui to oversee the demobilization of the Boy Scouts. According to him, China plans to organize and train aviation boy scout troops so that boy scouts who aspire to a career in aviation can receive basic aviation training.</p>

<p>He, at the advanced age of seventy-one, with a lung cancer that all doctors have given up on; even so, he begged to come and see his beloved, victorious China, one last time.</p>
<p>Yesterday at twelve noon, an American Navy plane from Honolulu landed at the muddy Jiangwan Airport. This was no ordinary plane, the latest C54 model, with a bedroom, a bathroom, a bed, a nurse, a doctor... And it brought an extraordinary passenger – China's chief foreign advisor, Mr. Endner.</p>
<p>Accompanying him was former Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Dong Xian Guang. General Huang Renlin of the battlefield service corps, and Flying Tiger General Chennault were at the airport to greet him. When the reporter boarded this luxurious and comfortable plane, Mr. Endner was chatting with General Chennault. Overflowing with supreme friendship and warmth between China's earliest and latest foreign advisors, the reporter was deeply moved by this sincere and touching scene.</p>
<p>Mr. Endner was wearing a gray wool suit and a khaki raincoat. Because he came from Hawaii, he was also wearing a straw hat. This was a man who had once single-handedly reversed the course of Chinese history. However, he was tired. His complexion was very haggard, and after shaking hands with the reporter, he was not as eloquent and talkative as before. General Chennault and a doctor helped him off the plane. An American Navy cameraman took many photos of this VIP who had never liked to be photographed. General Huang Renlin had originally prepared an ambulance for him, but he finally sat in General Chennault's car, and with great difficulty, he picked out a small road that could barely be used for military maneuvers on the airport's endless mud, circled around to the airport gate, and then changed to General Huang's car, accompanied by Mr. Dong and Huang to rest in room 300 of the Hong En Hospital.</p>
<p>He has lung cancer! Admittedly, in America, he could certainly get better care, but this seventy-one-year-old elder, terminally ill, requested to see his beloved, victorious China before it was too late.</p>
<p>President Chiang and his wife especially asked Dong Xianguang to go to Honolulu to pick him up. The US Navy immediately agreed to send him a comfortable plane to ride on. General Huang Renlin was ordered by the President to take care of him in Shanghai, so he slept at the airport for two nights, waiting for the plane. The reporter also went to Jiangwan Airport for three consecutive nights to greet him. Because the reporter knew that although Mr. Endner had struggled to fly across half the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai, the evening sun was infinite, and the reporter did not know how many more times he would be able to see him! Perhaps, in his life, the reporter was the last journalist he saw. Mr. Endner is Australian, originally a journalist, who was assigned as the New York Herald Tribune's reporter in China. Later, he went to Hong Kong and served as the editor-in-chief of the "De Chen Western Newspaper."</p>
<p>During his time as a journalist, Endner's most historic masterpiece was exposing Japan's "Twenty-One Demands" to China. At this time, Endner was the editor of "Far East Review" in Shanghai. The full content of the "Twenty-One Demands" and Japan's ambitions were first exposed by "Far East Review," and the Japanese hated him to the bone.</p>
<p>In 1915 (the sixth year of the Republic of China), when Sun Yat-sen wanted to find an English assistant, he invited Endner to take charge of the matter. Since then, this Australian journalist has become a mysterious figure in modern Chinese history.</p>
<p>In 1927 (the sixteenth year of the Republic of China), Endner served as Zhang Zuolin's advisor, and then as Zhang Xueliang's advisor. Through Zhang Xueliang's introduction, he became an aide to President Chiang.</p>
<p>Over the years, he advocated the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and he also helped the campaign to overthrow Yuan Shikai. He also promoted Zhang Xueliang's allegiance to the central government, completing the unification of the North and South. But his most commendable achievement was his efforts during the Xi'an Incident. Everyone must be clear about this matter.</p>
<p>When the war began, Japanese soldiers sent him to a concentration camp in Manila. Imprisoned in his old age, he finally contracted the cancer that doctors around the world fear the most. After the victory, he recuperated on the island of Tahiti for a period of time, and then went to Honolulu, where he met Earle Salle, the editor of the former Shanghai English Greater American Evening News. However, Salle was already blind. Mr. Endner felt that it was time to write his memoirs, so he collaborated with Salle, asking him to sort out the materials and write them. Decades of behind-the-scenes work have made him one of the people who knows the most about China's secrets. His memoirs will undoubtedly be the most valuable historical materials since the Republic of China, because he himself created a part of history.</p>
<p>His eyes are still shining brightly, his language is still clear, his handshake is still full of warmth, and his appearance is not more old than when the reporter met him twelve years ago, but—he knew that he had contracted a "cancer" in his lungs that no doctor could cure!</p>
<p>Some people say that he doesn't eat Chinese food, that he doesn't pronounce President Chiang's name like a Chinese, that he doesn't understand Chinese temperaments, and that he uses a foreign perspective to handle Chinese affairs. However, this frail, terminally ill "foreigner" has never forgotten China and loves China so sincerely! May a miracle come to the medical community to help him recover soon!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Han Tao, Chief Prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court, formally filed a public prosecution against traitor Chen Gongbo on the 18th and announced the following ten crimes of traitor Chen: (1) Concluding secret treaties that insulted the nation and infringed on its sovereignty; (2) Searching for materials and supplying them to the enemy; (3) Issuing counterfeit currency to disrupt the financial system; (4) Recognizing a thief as a father and declaring war; (5) Conscripting young men to serve the enemy; (6) Publicly selling opium to poison the people; (7) Revising teaching materials to implement slave education; (8) Taking advantage of the so-called "Qingxiang" campaign to massacre patriots; (9) Government officials engaging in corruption, with politics based on bribery; (10) Recruiting puppet troops to harm the country and the people.</p>

<h3>Government Advisor Brandford Has Left the United States for China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 17th] The New York Times, citing sources close to the government, reported that Mr. Brandford, appointed by President Truman a few weeks ago to reorganize China's budget, will have responsibilities that are more extensive than originally specified in his appointment. It is said that Mr. Brandford flew from Washington to China on Sunday and will be responsible for "the actual reorganization of the Chinese government. At the same time, his decisions may affect the social life and economic future of the Chinese people." The newspaper said that it is expected that Mr. Brandford will instill American democratic ideas into China's political system, "adjusting it to suit China's ancient philosophies and methods as part of his work in building administrative and financial plans." Although Mr. Brandford's official qualification is as an advisor to the Chinese government, "his tasks will include many aspects of a national urban planner." Before leaving, Mr. Brandford acknowledged the above points when interviewed by a New York Times reporter, saying: "I admit that the matters I will assist China with will be broader than reorganizing China's budget. I will make full use of my experience in administration or government organization. As for what specific work I will undertake, it will be determined by the wishes of the Chinese government."</p>
<h3>National Army Advances Northward Beyond Shenyang; Personnel Receiving Heilongjiang and Hejiang Provinces Return to Changchun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chongqing News: The precarious Northeast situation has become more serious due to the chaotic state north of Shenyang, but diplomatic circles in both Beijing and Chongqing believe that the pressure from the Northeast Communist Army has other purposes. It is not speculation to ask whether the true intention behind this pressure is to create a special situation north of Shenyang before Marshall's return to China and wait for the Military Mediation Department to go there for mediation. Currently, peace-loving people in Beijing and Chongqing, both Chinese and foreign, hope that this peace envoy will return to China as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] The receiving personnel from the Heilongjiang and Hejiang provincial governments returned to Changchun today by special train from Harbin. Harbin is currently surrounded by the Communist Army. There are occasional artillery exchanges in the suburbs, and robberies occur in the city from time to time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] There was heavy snow here on the afternoon of the 17th, which stopped late at night. The snow was still heavy on the morning of the 18th. Long-distance telephone lines south of Changchun have been cut off since 4:00 PM on the 17th and have not yet been restored on the 18th. Wireless telegraph communications between here and Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other places have also been interrupted, due to power outages in the aforementioned areas. [Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 17th] Reliable sources report that after the Soviet troops withdrew from Kaiyuan, Tieling, and Changtu one after another, they were disturbed by nearby Communist troops. After the Soviet troops withdrew from Siping Street, it was surrounded by 20,000 Communist troops starting at 2:00 PM on the 16th, and the airport was occupied.

The purpose is unclear, but it is definitely not a withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jinan office, 17th] The Communist troops in the Tai'an group have stopped repairing roads, claiming a lack of fuel and materials. However, the group stated that 30 tons of coal had been transported there a few days ago, so the fuel should not be exhausted.

The issue of continuing road repairs is still pending negotiation by the CCP representative Zheng Rennong after he returns to Jinan from Yi.</p>

During a reception for reporters, he stated: "By the end of this month, approximately one million Japanese soldiers and civilians in China will have been repatriated to their home country. I have also taken appropriate steps to plan for the repatriation of Japanese from the Northeast. If I am also responsible for this matter, it can be gradually implemented. However, the Northeast is currently occupied by Soviet troops, and the repatriation of Japanese from that area is still an unresolved issue and could easily cause misunderstandings. The United States feels that this is its responsibility because the Northeast has been recognized as part of the China war zone. Since we are all allies, any party can repatriate the Japanese."</p>

<h3>Iran Hesitates to File a Complaint; Soviets and Iranians are Negotiating Secretly; Rumors of a Possible Revolution in Tehran</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 18th Broadcasting: Iran, in these troubled times, has entered a state of quiet today. Iranian diplomatic actions are proceeding in secret. The Iranian Prime Minister refuses to meet with reporters. On the other hand, London officials have confirmed that if Iran does not file a complaint, the U.S. government will bring up the Iran issue before the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 18th] Today, reliable sources here stated that Soviet experts are currently engaged in secret negotiations with the Iranian government regarding oil concessions. Reports indicate that revolutionary actions may occur in the Iranian capital. It is said that the Sandana government is taking emergency measures to prevent a revolutionary coup. Meanwhile, diplomatic circles here believe that while the Iranian Prime Minister appears to oppose Soviet demands on the surface, he is actually secretly negotiating an oil agreement with the Soviets. They claim that the Iranian government is studying the suggestion of the former British ambassador, Prendergast, to submit the issue of Iranian oil resources to the United Nations for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 17th] According to diplomatic circles here today, negotiations on the political situation in Iran are expected to reach a peak in the days leading up to the meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York. These individuals believe that the Soviet military's movements within Iran are solely intended to force Iran to grant Moscow the privilege of developing its rich oil resources, and are not intended to threaten Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] A spokesperson for the Iranian Embassy in the UK announced today that Iran is only prepared to negotiate oil concessions with the Soviet Union on the condition that Soviet troops withdraw. Rumors that the Iranian Prime Minister is currently in Tehran negotiating with the Soviet side could not be confirmed or denied. However, Iranian law stipulates that oil concessions cannot be discussed until foreign troops have withdrawn, so the rumors are likely untrue.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Wan Romiko, returned to his post on Saturday after being away from the US for several months. It is expected that he will begin talks with senior US officials today in the hope of reducing the difficult issues facing the three powers when the United Nations Security Council convenes next Monday. Officials said that the key now lies with the Soviet side, and that if Moscow could issue some statement, it would be helpful to the overall situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The Iranian Embassy in the United States has not yet received instructions from Tehran as to whether the Iranian government will file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Charge d'Affaires in Tehran threatened the Prime Minister, informing him that the Soviet Union would consider Iran's complaint an unfriendly act. The Iranian government's hesitation is due to this.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 17th] The United Press International's London bureau reported today that it listened to broadcasts from Radio Moscow stating that the Soviet Azerbaijan Republic, which borders Iranian Azerbaijan, has opened many new oil wells, and its oil production is increasing by 210 tons per day.</p>
<h3>Frequent Soviet Troop Movements; Transportation Between Iran and Turkey Severed</h3>
<p>Tehran Radio Suddenly Stops Broadcasting</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 17th] Tehran Radio suddenly stopped broadcasting this afternoon. As of now, there has been no explanation for this. [Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 17th] According to news from the Azerbaijan Province, Soviet troops have not moved south, and the troops stationed in various regions have increased. The greatest increase in troops has been west of Tabriz. Several roads from Tabriz to the Turkish border have been blockaded, and transportation has been severed. In addition, Soviet troops are still moving in northern Iran, but there are no signs of them crossing the boundary line and heading south into Iran.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Yesterday's Tehran news: After Soviet troops were reportedly reinforced in Karaj, Iran did not send any troops to that area. Iranian newspapers avoid commenting on the actions of Soviet troops within the country. Reports of Soviet troop movements are all headlined with "According to foreign radio stations." Iraqi political figures are closely watching the situation in Iran, and most newspapers are publishing the actions of Soviet troops in prominent positions. Some say that Soviet troops are currently only 70 miles from the Iraqi border.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Tabriz Prevent American Vice-Consul from Passing</h3>
<p>Released Only After Proving Identity</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 17th] The State Department announced today that the American Vice-Consul in Tabriz, northern Iran, Luo Shaohua, was detained by Soviet sentries in that city for half an hour on Friday. He was released only after proving his identity.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] The US State Department has recently passed a measure to extend the government's wartime authority (including quantitative allocation and priority allocation rights) for nine months. This authority was originally scheduled to expire on June 30 of this year.</p>
<h3>Rampant Black Market in Germany; Thousands Arrested</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Germany, 17th] Black market transactions in Germany are highly organized. Recently, an entire train car of coal was stolen and transported over two hundred miles away, where it was sold and used to buy potatoes. This case was revealed by a British military officer, who frankly admitted that without the black market, Germans would have nothing to live on. This refers to small-scale transactions, as Germans rely on them to maintain their personal needs. Small transactions can hardly be eradicated forever. We can only try to prevent black market transactions from becoming rampant and unmanageable. The authorities are dispatching special police to hunt down the big players in the black market. Although many have been arrested, other smugglers have mostly changed to using remote paths and small roads, making it difficult to catch them all in one sweep. Black market transactions in Brunswick have recently become increasingly prosperous. British troops once surrounded the entire area and searched house by house, and thousands were arrested.</p>

<h3>Negotiations for New Treaty Between Turkey and Iraq Successful; Moscow Believes it Has Anti-Soviet Effects</h3>

It is widely believed that the treaty stipulates that if a Kurdish rebellion occurs on the Turkish-Iraqi border, the two countries will cooperate militarily.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 17th] Turkey and Iraq will sign an agreement in the Turkish capital next week to enhance ties between the two countries. The content of the agreement will be disclosed to the Arab League after it is signed. Iraqi Senate Speaker General Said and the leader of the delegation have arrived in the Turkish capital.</p>

<p>Indian League Urges Earnestly</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] In light of the imminent arrival of the British Cabinet mission to India, the Indian League convened a conference today to show its goodwill. During the conference, Professor Hosain, chairman of the Indian Liberation Committee, gave a speech, saying that the freedom of every Indian man, woman, and child is not a gift granted by the British, but their natural right. Without a free India, there is no free world. If powerful nations do not clearly state their attitude towards other countries, the blood of ordinary people will be shed in vain. The British should have a long-term vision. If Indians cannot freely decide their destiny, there can be no world peace. If India becomes a center of turmoil in Asia, the world's economic recovery will be difficult to complete. Only after India obtains complete freedom can it maintain genuine friendship with the UK and cooperate in the world's recovery.</p>
<h3>Peace Cannot Be Built on Widespread Famine; Lehman Appeals to the United Nations Again; Hoover and Entourage Travel to Europe for Inspection</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Atlantic City, 18th] UNRRA Director-General Lehman, who is about to step down, said in a speech at the plenary session today that there are millions of starving people in the world, and that war may break out again if they cannot be fed. The current famine situation is a test of the ability of the United Nations to act together to prevent large numbers of people from starving to death. It must be known that lasting peace cannot be built on famine.

<h3>Editorial: The Situation in the Northeast Requires Calm</h3>
<p>Since the Soviet army withdrew from Shenyang, the situation in the Northeast has remained shrouded in gloom, and has not yet reached the anticipated clarity. Recent news from the Northeast has also been quite chaotic. According to a report from this newspaper's Peiping office on the 17th, the situation in the Northeast remains extremely confused. The Communist troops may enter Harbin and even Changchun under the guise of the Li Zhaolin case. General judgment states that after Marshall consults with Truman, major diplomatic actions between China and the United States will be decided and commenced. Xiong Shihui is currently in Jinzhou dealing with the complex and ever-changing situation. While there is news from Chongqing that the Military Three-Person Group has reached an agreement on the Northeast issue, the Mediation Headquarters here has not received any specific instructions. Generally speaking, if the Military Three-Person Group can reach an agreement on the broad issues of the Northeast, the severity of the Northeast problem can be reduced. According to another report from this newspaper's Peiping office on the 17th, Li Zhaolin's death has thrown a new bomb into the current situation in the Northeast. This new bomb will serve as the roar of an impending hurricane in the Northeast. Some say that a certain party wants to use this to dilute and offset the Zhang Xinfu case, but the Liberation Three-Day Gazette, published by the CCP, firmly claims that this is a conspiracy by Chinese reactionaries against the Soviet Union and the Communists. From these reports, it can be seen that the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang is not enough to clarify the situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>In Washington, after arriving in the US capital, Marshal Marshall said at a press conference: "The situation in the Northeast is extremely serious," "a matter of life and death," and "on my last night in China, until ten minutes before I left, we were still reaching an agreement on dispatching an executive team to the Northeast ... There is still no representative from the executive headquarters in the East Nine Provinces, and the situation there is changing rapidly. Troops are moving everywhere, and various small conflicts are inevitable. These troops, especially on the Communist side, are almost unaware that we have reached an agreement. Therefore, we must quickly send an executive team to the Northeast." In Marshal Marshall's frank remarks, he did not underestimate the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast, but gave the Northeast situation a balanced description. This is of great help in clarifying the situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>However, the haze and chaos will eventually clear up one day. Given the seriousness of the situation in the Northeast today, we should especially know how to handle ourselves. The passion of national sentiment over the past month is not only sufficient to express the people's concern for the situation in the Northeast, but also a manifestation of the abundant and powerful vitality of our nation. However, the passion of national sentiment may not be of any positive help in resolving the situation quickly, and in some cases, it may even hinder the resolution of the situation. We cannot allow mistakes. The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast today is well known; the opening and even elimination of the serious situation requires our calm and composure. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly elaborated on the situation in the Northeast. The recent Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee also conducted a thorough review of the situation in the Northeast and proposed to establish a true friendship between China and the Soviet Union based on the principles of respecting our national sovereignty and maintaining world peace. It can be seen that our government, starting with Chairman Chiang, is exhausting its wisdom to seek a resolution to the situation in the Northeast. We should have faith in the government and should not add to the government's difficulties. Therefore, regarding the situation in the Northeast, we can no longer allow emotional excitement and should calmly and quietly await the government's measures and resolutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, our allies are also trying to find a way to resolve the Northeast issue. The notes sent by the UK and the US to the Soviet Union one after the other indicate how concerned the UK and the US are about resolving the situation in the Northeast. The reason why the Northeast issue has emerged in its current form is that international relations exist within it. Therefore, with the cooperation of our allies in resolving the Northeast issue, a satisfactory resolution can always be reached. At this time, we need to suppress our emotions to avoid adding to the seriousness of this already serious situation. In terms of the international relations of the Northeast issue, even figures like Marshal Marshall do not shy away from the seriousness of the situation. It can be seen that people in allied countries have a correct understanding of the situation in the Northeast; with a correct understanding, it is possible to have an appropriate resolution. The Northeast issue is an international problem. As long as international people have a correct understanding of this situation, it will not be difficult to have an appropriate resolution to this problem. This is another point why we need to be calm and composed.</p>
<p>In his closing remarks at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, Chairman Chiang said that we must use the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual concession to resolve the current disputes. After mentioning Marshal Marshall's contributions, the chairman also said: "Our allies are so concerned about the peace and unity of China, let alone our own compatriots. Of course, we should abandon any prejudices, take into account the future of the entire China, and implement the goal of peaceful unification. I hope that the Chinese Communist Party can sincerely accept the good intentions of our allied friends in the same way as our government. Faithfully implement the agreed plan, do not take actions outside the plan, and do not create unexpected complications. Then I believe that General Marshall's mission can be successful as scheduled." In today's serious situation in the Northeast, Chairman Chiang's closing remarks are particularly meaningful. We hope that the Communist troops in the Northeast and the Chinese Communist Party will deeply appreciate Chairman Chiang's remarks. Mutual understanding and mutual concession require tolerance. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, this is another point that requires us to be calm and composed.</p>
<h3>US Adopts the Latest P2V Aircraft</h3>
<p>Long Range, High Speed, Strong Firepower, Used to Maintain Law and Order</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hollywood, 18th] The United States Navy Department announced: the adoption of the new P2V peace patrol aircraft to maintain law and order in important areas of the United States. The engineering design of these aircraft is the most up-to-date. The carrying capacity and range are comparable to the B17 Flying Fortress and B24 Liberator super aircraft. Army and Navy engineers designed for two and a half years before completing this patrol aircraft with the longest range, highest speed, and strongest firepower. For example, a P2V aircraft based in Guam can reach Wake Island, Tokyo, Manila, Rabaul, etc., for non-stop patrol flights. A base in Manila can fly around Singapore, Shanghai, Hanoi, and other places. These aircraft can make non-stop flights of more than 5,000 miles, so non-stop flights from New York to Hawaii, Tokyo to Seattle, and Washington to Insk, can be made without refueling. The maximum speed is more than 300 miles per hour, and the normal speed is also more than 300 miles per hour. The aircraft is equipped with complete radar equipment and atomic bomb launchers, and can instantly become an invincible bomber. The wingspan and fuselage length of the aircraft, and the total bomb load, are similar to those of the Flying Fortress. It is equipped with two giant Pratt &amp; Whitney engines with a total of 4,600 horsepower. The range at full load is 3,500 miles, and the normal range is more than 5,000 miles, exceeding the range of the Flying Fortress by 50%, and can be compared with the B29 aircraft that ended Japan's fate. The P2V aircraft weighs 58,000 pounds, and its effectiveness is above that of a four-engine aircraft. After the engine form is improved, it is smaller than the engine of the B29 aircraft.</p>

The Industrial Association Requests Tax Rate Reduction. Xue Mingjian, Chairman of the South Jiangsu District Branch of the Chinese Industrial Association, stated that before the War of Resistance, the business tax on factories was levied according to the amount of capital. Now it has been changed to be levied according to the amount of turnover. Yesterday, he telegraphed the Legislative Yuan again, requesting that the tax law be revised and that the amount of capital be used as the standard in order to encourage production. He also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for relief from stamp duty and requested that the starting tax base be changed to over one thousand yuan and the tax rate be changed to one-thousandth.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Planning to Establish the Jiangnan Electrical Bureau. Before the War of Resistance, there were 116 electrical enterprises in Jiangsu Province, accounting for 23% of the country's power plants, with a total generating capacity of 340,000 kilowatts, accounting for 35% of the country's total generating capacity. After the victory, the central government believed that the electrical industry was of great importance to industrial development, so the Jiangnan Electrical Bureau was established, equipped with huge capacity, to coordinate and control, and implement a plan for centralized power generation and long-distance transmission. Now, the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch, in order to cooperate with the central government's plan, has decided to first plan to restore the original power plants in northern Jiangsu, and secondly, to use the surplus equipment from the original power plants in southern Jiangsu, and request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to install and transplant them to northern Jiangsu, in order to achieve balanced development of the electrical industry in both the north and south of the Yangtze River. The branch also believes that with the future prosperity of cities, the recovery of industry, and the inevitable increase in population, the existing water volume in Nanjing and Zhenjiang will be insufficient. Also, factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Xuzhou, Nantong and other places are gradually increasing, and the population will inevitably increase sharply. It is also necessary to add water plants to improve environmental sanitation. Therefore, the branch is now starting to plan and organize the water plants in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and to study and work on the addition of water plants in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Xuzhou, and Nantong.

<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing] Wu Junsheng, former Director of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to go to the United States in February of last year to inspect education. He inspected education in major cities in the United States and Canada for a year. He returned to China this spring and has reported the results of his inspection to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Recent Trends in American Education</p>
<p>According to his discussion: American post-war education has been fully restored. Because scientific research has made great contributions during the war, scientific research is still highly promoted after the war. For students who participated in service work during the war, the government provides preferential treatment to those who return to school to study at this time, by giving public funding. Currently, the United States is trending towards abandoning weaknesses and using strengths. Universities and middle schools focus on the simultaneous mastery of basic subjects and cultural cultivation, in order to cultivate versatile talents who, in addition to specialized skills, can also be proficient in various arts.</p>
<p>Statistics of Students at All Levels</p>
<p>It is also learned that in American higher education, out of a total population of 130 million, there are more than 1.3 million students receiving higher education, an average of one person per hundred receiving higher education. Schools are also increasing year by year as needed. As for secondary education, middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are everywhere. All primary school graduates who reach the age of entering secondary school voluntarily enter middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. Secondary education in the United States has almost become universal compulsory education, which is extremely popular. As for primary education, most children of school age have received national education. The ratio of actual school-age children to children in school is more than 95%, which is extremely popular.

<h3>A Student Uprising Occurs at Jinan University</h3>
<p>The Words "Cangfu" Cause a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Jianyang] At National Jinan University, Professor Wei Yinglin of the College of Liberal Arts, when explaining the word "Cangfu" in "A New Account of Tales of the World," said that "stealing father" was the way southerners used to refer to northerners in the past, similar to what Shanghainese call Jiangbeilao. Unexpectedly, this caused a misunderstanding among two students from northern Jiangsu, who immediately questioned him.</p>
<p>Riot: After Wei's explanation, it had already subsided, but after class, some students in the school, instigated by professors and students who disagreed with Wei, launched an organization called the "School Protection Committee," and slogans such as "Down with Wei Yinglin" suddenly appeared everywhere in the school. By the next night, these students rushed to Wei's residence and destroyed it. Another group of students in the school opposed this behavior and launched a "School Protection Group" to confront them. At the same time, it was discovered that the instigator of the destruction of Wei's house was another professor, Lu Huaidao, and the crowd was outraged, so they also rushed to Lu's residence and destroyed it. At this point, the two groups of students were in a stalemate, and the entire school went on strike.</p>
<p>Mediation: At the same time, both sides prepared weapons, almost leading to violence. Fortunately, with the strong mediation of local party, government, and military circles, a tragedy was avoided. All the teachers in the school also issued a "Letter to All Students," suggesting that since both groups of students were premised on "protecting the school," "loving the school" should take maintaining the school's reputation and resuming classes as the top priority, and all difficult issues should be resolved after President He returned to school. Subsequently, both groups of students agreed to resume classes immediately, but the classes of Professors Wei Yinglin and Lu Huaidao were ended ahead of schedule, and they left the school first. Whether Wei and Lu will continue to teach in the next semester will be decided after President He returns to school. A disturbance was thus resolved.</p>

The results of the review will be completed and announced by the end of April 1947. (4) Private vocational schools and above that have not been registered with the puppet organization, after completing the registration with the Ministry in accordance with legal procedures and being approved, their graduates' grades in school, after being reviewed and qualified by the Ministry, their graduation qualifications will be recognized without screening.

<h3>Trial Begins for the Case of the Murder of Pilots Shot Down During the Bombing of Tokyo</h3>
<p>Captain Nelson Testifies in Court Detailing the Process. The Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal Attends the Hearing. [Our newspaper] The trial of the case of the murder of the Doolittle pilots who bombed Tokyo began yesterday morning in Tilanqiao Prison by the US military court. The defendants are former Commander of the 13th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai, Sawada Shigeru, former warden of the Japanese military prison in Shanghai, Tachide Sotetsuro, former judge of the Japanese military court in Shanghai, Wakomitsu Yujitsuru, and Okada Ryuhei. After the court opened, the prosecutor reported on the case and applied for the prosecution of the four defendants, and read out the US government's note to the Japanese government through the Swiss government after the Sino-US declaration of war, urging it to abide by international wartime law, and</p>
<p>Protect prisoners of war, and received a reply from the Japanese government. Then, witness Captain Nelson reported the process. Nelson and other 119 pilots were ordered on April 18, 1942, to bomb Tokyo and other major cities, but the bombing targets were absolutely military installations. He also presented a map issued to each person by the authorities. On the way back, he and Lieutenant Fa's two planes were forced to land near Ningbo due to lack of gasoline. Of the ten people in the two planes, two died and eight were searched and captured by the Japanese military police three days later and sent to Shanghai. Later, they were sent to Tokyo. More than ten days later, they were interrogated by the Japanese Air Force, and then transferred to the Qiaotou Building in Shanghai. After two months, they were sent to the Jiangwan Concentration Camp, where they were treated harshly. Later, the former Japanese military court in Shanghai opened the trial, neither according to the trial regulations nor with a translator. During the interrogation, they were also severely beaten. The eight people were sentenced to death. Later, they were pardoned by the Japanese Emperor. Nelson and five others were sentenced to life imprisonment, and the other three were executed immediately. The trial adjourned at 4:30 pm yesterday and is scheduled to continue this morning. Also, when the case opened yesterday, the Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal also attended the hearing.</p>
<h3>Three Cases of Being Accused of Colluding with the Enemy Awaiting Judgment: Puppet Legislative Committee Member Convicted</h3>
<p>Gan Deyun Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Criminal Division of the Tilanqiao High Court opened a joint court at 2 pm yesterday to hear four cases of traitors. Except for the Hui Wenyuan case, which was adjourned because all three defense lawyers failed to appear in court, the other three cases were closed for debate and will be sentenced at 2 pm on the 25th of this month. Here are the brief records of the three cases that have been closed for debate: (1) Lu Jinbiao, 31 years old, from Xinghua, was accused of serving as a guard of the 76th Regiment of the 22nd Puppet Division in Xinghua in January 1945. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for colluding with the enemy to plot against the country and serving in relevant military positions. The defendant argued that he was a peddler and had never been to Xinghua. His lawyer, Wu Chuliang, argued that the evidence against him had not been investigated, and that there were many who served in the puppet army, so why was he the only one accused of being a traitor, which clearly indicated that there were other reasons for this, and requested that he be declared innocent.</p>
<p>(2) 43 years old, from Ningbo, was accused of being a special agent and intelligence officer for the 1629th Unit in 1937, a tea house worker in the Huazhong Railway Protection Zone in Hangzhou in 1939, and a translator at the Longhua Aircraft Factory in 1943. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for colluding with the enemy and recruiting workers for the enemy. Lin Zhi admitted that he was a tea house worker in the Huazhong Railway Protection Zone, arguing that it was due to financial hardship. His lawyer, Wu Zhaochang, also used this to defend him and cited that he was falsely accused by the landlord due to a housing dispute.</p>
<p>(3) Le Jiajun, from Zhenhai, 26 years old, was accused of serving as an investigator in the Fifth Section of the Puppet Economic Bureau. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him because the Fifth Section of the Puppet Economic Bureau was in charge of the rise and fall of prices and had engaged in extortion of merchants. Witness Wang Shuang, the accountant of Yichang Silk and Satin Shop on Shandong Road, testified in court that Le had come to the shop to investigate in September 1944, and that the shop had sent him a festival gift of 40,000 yuan, which was recorded in the accounts. Another witness, Yao Ruilian, pointed out that he had threatened him in the name of investigation. The defendant argued that he was an internal staff member in the Economic Bureau and had never gone out to investigate. His lawyer, Wu Chuliang, argued that he had left the bureau in April 1944 and requested further investigation.</p>
<p>[Also News] The traitor Gan Deyun (Kentwell, i.e., Gan Weilu) was accused of being a member of the Puppet Legislative Yuan and founded the magazine "Voice of China." The case had been previously reported in detail in this newspaper and had been closed for debate. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui announced the verdict: "Gan Deyun is guilty of colluding with the enemy and plotting against the country, and is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for five years, and all property, except for a reasonable amount for the necessary living expenses of his family, shall be confiscated." Gan looked quite indignant after hearing the verdict.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factory Director Who Killed Our Compatriots Not Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court opened a trial on a case of a Japanese person killing our compatriots yesterday afternoon. The case originated with Ye Jigu, a 34-year-old Nanjing native, residing at No. 5 Xilin Family Residence, Xinzhao Zhou Road, who worked at the Jiangnan Shipyard. On September 15, 1939, Ye and workers from his department were sent by the factory to repair the Minsheng warship. On that day, the work was completed, and the ship sank that night. After a thorough investigation by the factory, it was alleged that only Ye and five others knew about the secret hatch at the bottom of the ship, so they falsely accused Ye, Lu Ada, and Zhang Yongfang of being "Chongqing elements" who deliberately sabotaged their military construction. Factory Director Nakayama Hajime (residing at No. 13 Park Lane, Jiangwan Road) sent Police Section Chief Yoshimura (residing at No. 14 in the same lane) to arrest them and subject them to torture to extract confessions. The next day, they were transferred to another location, and have not been heard from since. After the victory, Ye Jiaxi and Lu A'er sued the local procuratorate, which summoned Yoshimura, who admitted to the incident, saying that he was acting on orders and did not know that Ye and others had died. However, since Ye and others were falsely accused of "sabotaging military construction," they were undoubtedly executed. After a detailed investigation by the local procuratorate, they were prosecuted for the crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, because Nakayama Hajime had not been apprehended and Yoshimura did not appear in court, the trial was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

The robber fled to Gansu Road, Kaifeng Road, and because he was changing his ammunition clip, he was grabbed around the waist by Deng Xuezheng (25 years old, from Wuxi). At that time, Zhao Zenggui, a plainclothes police chief from the sub-bureau, happened to be passing by and helped Deng seize a Mauser gun with eleven bullets. At the same time, the two police officers who had been chasing after him also arrived and saw that the robber's head had been hit by two bullets, and he died soon after. Afterward, the original stolen goods were found intact on the robber's body, as well as a military police symbol. After being identified by Deng Fuwu, a captain of the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment of the Shanghai South Military Police Team, at the North Station Sub-bureau, it was confirmed that the deceased robber was indeed a military police officer named Chen Yihua, 19 years old, from Hunan. However, according to Captain Deng, Chen had secretly escaped with weapons on the 11th of this month and had not been found until now. He did not know that he had become a robber. As for Deng Xuezheng, who helped capture the robber, Director Yi rewarded him with a bonus of 10,000 yuan, which was issued by Section Chief Zhuo of the Detective Section yesterday for Deng to receive.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Gold Shops Have Brisk Business as Redemption Enquiries Surge - Gold Prices Rise Slightly - Central Bank Continues to Allocate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the report that US Senator Wang Zhang raised the gold purchase price caused a general floating belief in gold purchases among the people. Small gold shops saw a surge in redemption inquiries. The market opened with replenishment yesterday (in fact, the price of gold in this city has risen to over 80 yuan per tael). Those who knew the situation in the industry sold off, and soon retreated to around 1.65 million, before starting to struggle. After 10 o'clock, it hovered below 1.64 million. The Central Bank allocated 390 bars to the industry at a price of 1.62 million, and this price was also seen at the lowest. The market was very stable at noon, standing at around 1.64 million. There were still sporadic retail sales in the afternoon, and although trading was limited, the market price rose slightly to around 1.66 million. As a result, it was about 60,000 better than last Saturday. Gold shop ornaments were quoted at 180,000 yuan, silver bullion at 1,600, and silver dollars were sold at 870 yuan. The money market was average, and the underground interest rate ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 cents. The position of speculators was tighter than that of outsiders.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were mediocre, opening at around 2,050 yuan. The gold market fell back, and then slightly dropped to around 2,030 yuan. It remained stable and quiet at noon and in the afternoon. As a result, it was 15 yuan better than last Saturday. Hong Kong tickets were once popular, and finally old goods were stable and new goods turned weak (new Hong Kong goods retreated to 29% compared to old goods). Old goods once rose to 440 yuan for purchase, and new goods never exceeded the high price of Saturday. As a result, old goods rose another 5 yuan, and new goods fell back 3 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged, Hong Kong telecommunications was 450 yuan, and Robbie was 550 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks End Long Positions - Foreign Stocks Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Become Active</h3>
<p>Although public bonds rose yesterday, it was difficult to sustain. Class C once rebounded to around 1,850 yuan, but the stock market fell and the bondholders also felt weak, and then fell by more than 200 yuan. The results of the noon close were that Class A, B, D, and E closed slightly earlier and rose slightly compared with last Saturday, while Class C fell slightly. After the Chinese stocks were sold off by long positions last Saturday, they moved to foreign stocks. Yesterday, there was a sudden and universal end to long positions. The initial opening of each stock was still stable. The industry's long positions were the first to end, and the customer's floating long positions followed suit. Yongsha retreated to 3,600 yuan, and Mayia to 2,650 yuan, and then there was a slight rebound. The smaller familiar stocks fell by 10% from the opening price and ended at a low price. Compared with last Saturday, Yongsha fell back by 230 yuan, Mayia fell by 150 yuan, and Jingfu and other three small hot stocks fell by 5 yuan to 10 yuan each. The asking price was slightly higher in the afternoon, and the foreign stocks gained the addition of large households in the Chinese stock sector, and the style changed. A large amount of floating capital gathered when they saw the heat. Yisha jumped to the 7,000 yuan mark in the morning, and the British Federation to the 9,000 yuan mark. The market price was manipulated under the hype. Some foreign merchants with sharp eyes and quick hands also chased after them, and at noon, some saw the high and turned around, and some were still surrounded by buying. Compared with last Saturday, Yisha Yinglian jumped by 20% in the hottest attitude, and the rest ranged from 10% to 15%.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks in Recovered Areas - Supplementary Measures Already in Place</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has formulated a "Commercial Bank Restoration Method in Recovered Areas" and a "Commercial and Financial Institution Liquidation Method in Recovered Areas," stipulating that commercial banks approved by the Ministry of Finance before the war may be liquidated and restored. Others that have not been approved by the Ministry of Finance will be liquidated in accordance with the "Liquidation Method" and will not be allowed to operate. Later, in order to avoid the impact on local finance caused by the stagnation of a part of the Shangrong firms and banks in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and other places with a long history but not registered before the war due to the restrictions of laws and regulations, based on the facts, the "Supplementary Measures for the Restoration of Commercial Banks" was formulated. The main contents are as follows: (1) All firms and banks that have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and were established before the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and continued to operate during the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to being liquidated in accordance with the "Commercial and Financial Institution Liquidation Method in Recovered Areas," may submit the following documents within three months after the promulgation of these measures, and after being approved by the Ministry of Finance, may continue to operate in the original place and register in accordance with regulations. Otherwise, they will be ordered to suspend operations. The documents required are (1) the business license issued by the former Ministry of Industry or the Provincial and Municipal Government Engineering Bureau, (2) proof of joining the local chamber of commerce or commercial association before the war, (3) proof of no collaboration during the Anti-Japanese War, (4) the income statement for the year before the war to two years and for each year during the Anti-Japanese War, (5) the tax payment certificate before the war, (6) the document from the local municipal and county government proving its relationship with local finance, (7) All firms and banks that have not been approved for registration by the Ministry of Finance and were established before June 26th of the Republic of China (1937), and were suspended due to the Anti-Japanese War, are required to submit the previous items (1), (2), (5), (6), (7) within three months after the promulgation of these measures The documents and proof of suspension due to the Anti-Japanese War, the income statement for one to three years before the Anti-Japanese War, and after being approved by the Ministry of Finance, may resume operations in the original place, and then complete the registration procedures.</p>
<h3>US Gold Price Problem - Miners Demand Higher Prices - Congress Unlikely to Approve</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Denver, Colorado, 18th] The United States is gradually resuming gold mining. Last year's output was the smallest since 1847, with 967,000 ounces of pure gold. This compares with 995,000 ounces in 1944 and 6,003,000 ounces in 1940, the highest record ever (including the Philippines). In terms of value, it was US$34 million in 1945 and US$210 million in 1940. The main US gold mines were all closed from October 1942 to July 1, 1945. Since the cancellation of the closure order in July last year, gold production has gradually increased, but four-fifths of the gold produced in the United States is a by-product of ordinary metal mines. These ordinary metal mines are hindered by lack of materials and labor. Moreover, the price of gold is fixed, while general prices are gradually rising, and production costs are increasing, which makes miners hesitant. Producers and members of Congress in gold-producing states, in addition to finding ways to compensate for the losses during the wartime shutdown period, are urging the authorities to pass legislation stipulating the following items: (1) Provide special interest-free government loans (secured by future production, not by the mines themselves); (2) Raise the price of gold to US$56 per ounce; (3) Give US gold mine operators a subsidy of US$10 per ounce; or (4) Allow gold mine operators to sell gold at the most favorable prices to the world, that is, to freely buy and sell on the world market. However, the hope of passing the above points in Congress is extremely slim.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market is still rainy, and japonica and indica rice continue to rise by 500-600 yuan, up to nearly 1,000 yuan. Although the external sales of flour are sluggish, the local demand is strong, and the price continues to rise. The oil market raw oil sells as soon as it arrives, and soybean oil cannot match the sales as it arrives. The demand exceeds the supply, and the price continues to rise by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybeans are in high demand and secondary stock is stagnant, soybean cakes rise by more than 100 yuan, and skin rises by more than 100 yuan, raw kernels are firm, and sesame is average.</p>
<p>It is also reported that from March 11 to 16, a total of more than 42,000 dan of rice of various colors arrived at the temporary rice market in this city, including 21,891 shi of white japonica, 16,496 shi of thin rice, 900 shi of sheep indica, 3,048 shi of Du oil, 140 shi of Wu indica, 80 shi of white yuan, and 100 shi of Yin yuan.</p>
<h3>HSBC Banknotes - Some Have Been Altered in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong News: HSBC's large-denomination banknotes of 50 yuan, 100 yuan, and 500 yuan, because some of them belonged to banknotes that were forced to be reissued during the fall, Hong Kong announced after its restoration that this kind of large-denomination notes issued under duress, with designated numbers, were temporarily suspended from use. Since then, although these banknotes have not circulated on the market, black market exchanges have often hovered at about half of the face value, either higher or lower. However, it has recently been discovered on the market that the numbers of these temporarily non-circulating banknotes have been altered to general numbers. Because the alteration work is very sophisticated, the public did not pay attention to it at first, and it was not able to be revealed. Later, it flowed into the bank, and was discovered by people in the bank. It was not until the Hong Kong authorities officially re-issued the 100 yuan banknotes with numbers starting from 65,000 that more banknotes with altered numbers that had not been announced as approved for circulation were discovered. According to a reporter from the bank, it is difficult to discover this kind of banknotes with altered numbers, and only people in the bank that issued this kind of banknotes have a few points that can be used as a basis for identification.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Flat - Progress in Spot Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>The yarn market yesterday was still very mediocre, with few customers and a very indifferent sentiment, so the fluctuations were very narrow. As a result, the market was neither glorious nor disgraceful compared with the end of the weekend. The Fangjian Company routinely posted prices at noon, offering for sale more than 20 kinds of yarn from 1 count to 60 counts. The 20-count yarn, which has not been sold for a long time, was auctioned yesterday, with a price of 1 million yuan per bale, which is lower than the transaction price on the market, but it will take at least five days to deliver the spot goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York US cotton rose and fell differently, up and down 2 to 9 points. The near-term was US$26.62, the far-term was 26.39, and the meterling spot was 27.22. The local spot cotton market was firm, and trading also progressed, because private yarn factories such as Shenxin 169 should purchase successively. A total of 1,200 to 1,300 bales were traded, but Fangjian Company is still waiting and seeing.</p>
<h3>Application Deadline for Foreign Exchange Operating Firms Extended</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, This City News) According to Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Review Department of the Central Bank, the deadline for various firms to apply to the bank to be approved as Class A and B operating firms and foreign exchange brokers, originally set for March 19 this year, has been extended for two weeks with the approval of the Ministry, and the deadline has been changed to April 2 this year. After review, foreign exchange operating licenses will be issued. Since the Central Bank opened foreign exchange, in addition to the 27 designated Chinese and foreign banks and 16 qualified foreign exchange brokers (Chinese and foreign), and qualified China Travel Service of Class B, there have been increasing numbers of applications for approval as Class A and B operating firms and brokers. As of yesterday, there were a total of 144 companies in Class A (including one foreign merchant and one out-of-town merchant), five companies in Class B (including three Chinese and two Western), and 24 applications for brokers (Westerners accounted for four). It is heard that the qualifications for Class B operating firms must be those without branches all over the world, and it is expected that there will be three. Due to concerns about affecting the business within their scope, it will be difficult to add more brokers for the time being, except for those who have already qualified.</p>
<h3>90,000 Bales of American Rice - Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) Food panic is spreading globally. China relies on imported rice for subsidies. Before the war, imported rice was shipped from Siam, Vietnam, Burma, etc. However, during the war, there were poor harvests everywhere, so exports were prohibited. The source of imported rice is lacking. The United States, in view of this, is trying to provide relief. It is now learned that 90,000 bales of rice have been purchased from Houston and are being loaded onto the Deek Lykes to be shipped to China for relief. They will arrive soon. Yesterday, bituminous coal was allocated at par by various production factories.</p>
<h3>Factory Coal Allocation - Bituminous Coal Plummets Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, bituminous coal began to be allocated at par to various production factories, so factory sales stagnated, and households were full of coal. The market was quiet, and prices continued to fall. White coal crumbs also continued to fall due to the steady flow of goods, but white coal screened lumps were still exhausted, and prices were stable.</p>
<p>The application method for the Fuel Management Committee's factory flat coal is that the industry association must compile and apply for review, and each factory can directly obtain the form from the association, fill it out and apply. The deadline for requesting the form is three days.</p>

<h3>High Hat</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>There is an English saying: "You can tell a gentleman by his top hat."</p>
<p>Perhaps because humans are beings who cannot do without hats; therefore, when monkeys dress up as humans, they must also wear a hat on their heads to look the part.</p>
<p>Since hats have a hierarchical nature, distinguishing between a "person" and a "non-person," they naturally also distinguish between "people" and "superiors." Thus, figures wearing tall top hats are elevated to the status of "gentlemen." At the very least, you can stand before the "Gentleman" sign hanging in front of the toilet without feeling ashamed.</p>
<p>A top hat may be an abstract thing, but when it lands on one's head, it feels very concrete. Therefore, no matter how high and large the hat is, there is always someone to wear it; even if some people's heads are not particularly strong, strangely, no matter how high the hat is worn like a tower, not only is there no burden, but they feel a burst of lightness, comfort, and even a sense of elation! There are days when they almost cannot get through the day without wearing a top hat.</p>
<p>"Psychology is the soul of the market." Where there is demand, there is supply. Therefore, top hats quickly became one of the "hot commodities" of worldly philosophy. At any time, in any place, for any person, offering them a top hat is always supremely auspicious. They may have a good impression of you; you may have new gains from them!</p>
<p>Clever people, when they put this mysterious hat on someone else's head, may be secretly thinking: "What, there are actually people who like this illusory thing?" But when another person puts a top hat on their head, they obediently feel "comfortable"!</p>
<p>People cannot escape contradictions. The more contradictory things are, the more they enjoy spinning around in them. This is what allows top hats to flourish in the circle of contradictions, to be born and grow.</p>
<p>A gentleman hailed a rickshaw and was about to negotiate the fare when the rickshaw puller offered him a top hat: "What's there to negotiate! Would a gentleman like you haggle over such a small amount?" After pulling half the distance, the gentleman returned the favor with a top hat: "Look at the way you're pulling, you're running with incredible energy!" As a result, the gentleman rode a rickshaw that was as fast as a car, and the rickshaw puller received a fare equal to that of a car, to everyone's delight!</p>
<p>Mutual flattery, mutual benefit! The contradiction lies here, and the wonderful use also lies here!</p>
<p>If people are still so proud, they will become more ignorant, and their ignorance will often be mistaken for more wisdom!</p>
<p>It seems that the future of top hats is still quite bright.</p>

<h3>Spring in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— Lu Wu</p>
<p>It has been almost half a year since the victory. The Japanese North Jiangsu garrison in Yangzhou has been disarmed and sent to the concentration camp in Xin Nanmen. Sun Liangcheng's troops, who imposed excessive taxes and harassed the people, have been transferred to Anhui. The people's frenzy of welcoming the National Army has gradually cooled down. The red and green slogans and large murals on the streets and alleys have also been eroded by the ruthless wind and rain, leaving only fragments of remnants. With the arrival of spring, what it brings to the common people of the county is displacement, excessive taxes, the supply of permanent troops, the requisitioning by the county government, soaring prices, this series of threats to the people's suffering... Poor North Jiangsu!</p>
<p>Although the destruction of Yangzhou is not comparable to that of northern Fujian, Guilin, and Liuzhou, if you wander through the former residences of salt merchants, you will only see broken tiles and dilapidated walls. The towering mansions of the past have vanished without a trace. The flowers, plants, and trees in the scenic area north of the city have been completely cut down, and the so-called Slender West Lake is just a pool of Wu water. "Green Willow City Walls" has become a historical term, left for those who study history to reminisce! The city is surrounded by deep ditches and ramparts, and the city guards with guns and live ammunition are once again in a state of high alert as if facing a formidable enemy. The residents of the county town spent the harsh winter in this apprehensive and tense situation. Now it is spring, let the sunshine shine on and warm everyone!</p>
<p>Among the dozen or so counties in North Jiangsu, there is not a single place that has not been trampled by the enemy's iron hooves. Countless people have died in the artillery fire, especially in the countryside. As long as you go deep into the villages, you will understand the suffering of the farmers' lives. It is estimated that those who can fill their stomachs with coarse rice are already the richest in the village. Ordinary farmers are poorly clad, and their hard work for a year is not enough to pay for the military rice. They usually fill their stomachs with miscellaneous grains, and many even abandon their homes and flee. At present, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not even included North Jiangsu in the scope of relief. North Jiangsu has been forgotten!</p>
<p>Yangzhou's commerce is still prosperous. The flour mill has resumed operation, but it only supplies the needs of the local troops. Although the power plant has restored electricity, there is insufficient coal, the light is dim, and the electricity bill is 600 yuan in legal tender per kilowatt-hour, which ordinary families cannot afford. Other prices are much more expensive than in Shanghai. Taking rice as an example, North Jiangsu used to be the granary of Jiangsu. In recent years, rice and grain cannot be shipped into the city for relief. The county town's food supply entirely relies on imports from South Jiangsu. The price of rice has soared to more than 30,000 yuan per stone. The people's livelihood is difficult, and the crisis is severe!</p>
<p>Speaking of Yangzhou's county administration, in the past enemy-puppet era, other than the baojia system being handled passably, there was nothing else worth mentioning. And the current government is just rehashing the old articles. Health and public construction are not taken seriously. Despite the garbage being all over the place and the stench overflowing, the "residence permit" is handled vigorously. In terms of education, things are simplified and educators have just received their January salaries this year. Working for the public on an empty stomach, their spirit of nurturing talents is truly admirable!</p>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, prices have soared. The price of gold took the lead, followed closely by the price of rice. Hoarding and manipulation are rampant. As a result, stores close early or hide their goods and refuse to sell. Therefore, the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. The gift that victory brought to the people is "a threat to life." Thinking about the future, it is difficult to imagine!</p>
<p>Spring is in Yangzhou, but how can the people of Yangzhou smell the breath of spring? So much poverty, so much displacement, so much hesitation, the vast Yangtze River, the misty white clouds, symbolize the suffering of the residents of North Jiangsu, continuously!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>"No Way"?</h3>
<p>— Hong Yimu</p>
<p>I have heard the phrase "no way" too often, especially when requesting something from higher authorities or superiors.</p>
<p>Originally, when something or a problem occurs, one should try to solve it, which naturally requires some thinking, some consideration, and sometimes a lot of brainstorming. Using the phrase "no way" to brush it off reduces a lot of trouble. This is the magic weapon for those who practice expediency.</p>
<p>The phrase "no way" is a narcotic for thought, an obstacle to progress. It obscures infinite light and cuts off the path of life. Those who always say there is no way are certainly self-abandoning laggards who will never have a future or happiness. Napoleon's dictionary did not have the word "difficult," meaning that he always found a way out of no way.</p>
<p>Conversely, it is foolish to insist that there is a way when there is really "no way." The warlords' military unification, the bureaucrats' dark and oppressive autocracy, Hitler's conquest of the world, these dreams, in the moment before their failure, did they not all claim to have a way?</p>
<p>Currently, the customers buying tickets at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Station are extremely crowded. Their clothes are torn, their shoes are trampled off, and those carrying luggage and goods are even more unimaginable. They have to queue up, with no place to put their luggage. They have to queue up for three or four hours, and they cannot even go to relieve themselves. Leaving the queue would risk being "left behind." Everyone sighs and laments.</p>
<p>I once asked the station managers why they did not try to improve the situation. They always replied that there were too many people and "there was no way." I think there are ways, but you just don't want to do them. The first way is to extend the ticketing hours. After one train leaves, sell tickets for the next train, one ticket at a time. Wouldn't that be great? Why wait until everyone is there before "opening," like watching a movie? The second way is to open more ticket windows. More ticket windows can reduce crowding. If you say that manpower is not economical, is it economical for thousands of people to queue up to buy tickets? You don't implement these methods and instead say "there is no way." I really "have no way" with these people!</p>
<p>There are many similar examples. For example, rising prices, the difficult lives of civil servants, rampant corruption, the bankrupt rural economy, these are all things that ordinary people think "there is no way" to solve. In my opinion, if we democratize politics, make a comprehensive plan for national affairs, restrain selfish and self-interested mentalities, treat other people's affairs as our own, and take into account the interests of the country and nation and the happiness of the people, then these problems can be easily solved.</p>

<h3>China's Mathematical Genius</h3>
<p>— Wang Younong</p>
<p>This newspaper previously reported that Professor Hua Luogeng of Southwest Associated University was invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to lecture in Moscow for two months. Then, our military department sent Hua and two other professors from the Associated University to the United States to study national defense science. Hua's experiences are little known. Here is a brief account:</p>
<p>Hua is from Jintan County, Jiangsu, and his family was very poor. His father ran a cotton retail shop, barely able to make a living. Therefore, after graduating from junior high school in his county, he only attended Shanghai Zhonghua Vocational School for one year before dropping out and working as an accounting assistant at his former junior high school. He was particularly interested in mathematics. He was very skilled and fast at using the abacus. He once ranked first in the school-wide abacus competition in Shanghai. In his home, whether it was an old newspaper or a used envelope, it was always covered with his calculations. He even continued to calculate while eating or defecating. Relying on diligent self-study and not being ashamed to ask questions, although he only had a junior high school education, he mastered all aspects of advanced algebra, calculus, and analytic geometry, whether in Japanese or Western texts. He was truly a mathematical genius. University students with difficult problems would come to him for help during their vacations, and he would always solve them immediately.</p>
<p>Around 1933 or 1934, he published papers on the theory of sixth-degree equations and the principle of imaginary numbers in the "Science" magazine of the China Science Society, which attracted great attention from the mathematical community. They thought he was at least a graduate of the mathematics department of a famous university. Later, through the introduction of a fellow villager, he became a temporary assistant in the mathematics department of Tsinghua University. Because he was very young, only twenty-four or twenty-five years old, and his qualifications did not even qualify him as a teaching assistant, the students in the mathematics department liked to study with him, and the department head gradually looked at him differently. Later, Hua made several discoveries in mathematical theory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the school sent him to the United States to study for a while. He has been a full professor ever since. When Hua was in the United States, he studied mathematics and physics with Albert Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, so he was also known internationally as a young mathematical prodigy.</p>
<p>Hua's left leg is crooked outward and cannot stand straight, so he walks in a rocking motion. This was because he had been bedridden for a long time when he was twenty years old, and he continued to read and calculate, only using his hands and brain, and forgetting to move his legs. As a result, the cartilage between his knee joints was invaded by bacteria and changed its shape. According to doctors at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, his left leg would have to be amputated and reassembled to be restored. It is not known whether this young mathematician has cured it during his studies in the United States, where medical technology is advanced.</p>
<p>From the above account of Hua's becoming a mathematical master, we can see that one does not necessarily have to rely on school education to study, nor does one necessarily have to have the best environment. For any subject, if one has a special interest and is determined and not afraid of hardship, one can always achieve good results.</p>

<h3>Establishing Good Customs</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>The establishment, change, or even disappearance of a custom, whether it is a good or bad custom, is not something that can be accomplished overnight. It requires countless perseverance and continuous efforts to accumulate before it can be effective. Perhaps humans are lazy creatures, so they attach particular importance to habits and even try to prevent the growth of new environments. Despite this, human civilization is progressing day by day, but the ugliness of human society still remains in many corners.</p>
<p>The rise of wartime profiteering has made many short-sighted people forget about learning and morality, and turn to the pursuit of money. This is the prevailing custom. Writers have reached the end of their road, and cultural workers have become the most unfortunate and pitiful insects in society. In this kind of atmosphere, the only things that people discuss are getting rich and making a fortune.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that whether it is in the officialdom, the business world, or even the education and cultural circles, there are many dark secrets. Of course, we cannot deny that many loyal and unyielding people are struggling hard, but everyone knows that there are also many unfilial people engaging in deceitful activities and living promiscuous and extravagant lives. Everyone knows that this is wrong, but everyone is still doing it, because this is the prevailing custom. Whoever does not plan for themselves seems to be a fool.</p>
<p>A good custom can prosper a country; a bad custom can destroy a country. Everyone is immersed in bad customs and knows that these customs are bad and can destroy the country, but no one has the courage to reform them, thinking, "What's the use of being the only one sober when everyone else is drunk?" Let's just be confused together! - Perhaps this is also a kind of custom, a custom that causes everyone to delay and procrastinate.</p>
<p>To put the country's politics, economy, culture, and all departments on the right track, the first step must be to establish good customs in each department. The establishment of these good customs is not the business of one person or one group, but should be the responsibility of everyone.</p>
<p>Bad customs are the cumulative result of years of badness, and we should mercilessly eliminate them. Good customs are the cumulative result of years of goodness, and we should carefully protect them. Furthermore, we should do everything we can to create new good customs!</p>
<p>Of the customs that fill society, how many are good? How many are bad? How many should be changed? How many should be eliminated? I think everyone must be able to understand! However, understanding alone is not enough. Everyone must lead by example and strive to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Low Prices Actually Evolve into Black Markets</h3>
<p>Speculative merchants manipulate at will, disregarding the lives of ordinary people. The government originally intended to help ordinary people by offering low-priced flour. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has repeatedly revised the distribution method, reporting that ordinary people have the possibility of purchasing it, and limiting the price to 6,000 yuan per bag. The law is perfect, but some speculative merchants, relying on their large sums of money, manipulate at will and purchase in bulk, so that ordinary people, despite having the money, still sigh in vain. If they need it, they have no choice but to turn to the black market, where the price is 8,000 or 9,000 yuan per bag. If this continues, what can we imagine! The government's good intention of providing low-priced relief often backfires and completely enters the black market. Ordinary people cannot enjoy the benefits. How can this be called relief?</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] Recently, the general public has criticized the methods of the Enemy Property Administration and the Relief Branch for auctioning or selling daily necessities at low prices. This is because the large amount of materials sold are manipulated by a small number of speculative merchants, while the vast majority of ordinary people get nothing. For example, the cloth, sugar, fish, soap, flour, etc., that were sold off before. Public opinion is outraged, but the authorities insist on their own way. Now that the household survey has been completed and national identity cards have been issued, "rationing based on population" should be the fairest and most reasonable method. We hope that the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government will consider the people's difficulties, argue according to reason, and the common people will be fortunate!</p>
