<p>〔本報鎭江十六日電〕據揚州急電，久爲各方矚目關懷之蘇北局勢，已漸由黯淡沉悶空氣中，趨入明朗開展之途。緣蘇北共軍，自違背政府停戰命令發動大規模攻勢後，國軍因遵守停戰命令　，一致採取守勢，致近週以來，有被各個擊破之危險，本月十三日揚泰公路之交界點廣福橋，首遭切斷，十五日泰縣及口岸等地，均受莫大威脅，一時人心惶惶，情勢極為嚴重。駐防揚泰國軍，爲振奮人心實行自衛計，現已開始攻擊，經過一晝夜大戰後，已將共軍主力擊潰，一舉克復宣家堡，突入泰興城，共軍被完全肅淸，現泰興方面共軍已向東南方面竄逃，國軍正擴大戰果乘勝追擊中，又泰縣東南張匋鎭共軍，約一萬五千人來犯，亦被國軍擊退。至口岸情勢，尙稱穩定，口泰（州）公路暢通無阻，揚泰公路，亦經國軍搶修完竣，傳另一部國軍，已繞道迫進邵伯，揚泰兩地民衆聞訊後，咸極興奮。江都日報及江蘇省報特出號外</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕共軍向蘇北發動全面總攻擊，京滬各地人民，因此而引起極度之憂慮，記者特就此事走訪國防部發言人，叩詢情况及意見，據稱當此和平談判，面臨嚴重階段之際，共軍突調集十六個團兵力，向蘇北發動全面總攻勢，顯欲不顧一切，一舉奪取長江北岸各城鎭，控制長江下游，威脅京滬，造成依恃暴力之有利地位，如泰興·宣家堡·張甸等城鎭，均於十五日被共軍攻陷，並圍海門泰縣，同時一股進攻六合以北之十五里店，而揚州靖江南通，及皖境來安嘉山等處，均告急，徐州　山東海亦陷入緊迫狀態中。六合距首都僅三十餘公里，海門距上海僅五十公里，泰興距首都亦不過一百四十公里，如各該城失陷，則京滬震動，江南可危，共軍此種有計劃之進攻，完全違反本年一月十日停止衝突協定。發言人復稱，蘇北與首都及上海，僅一江之隔，自一月十三日停止衝突令生效起，至七月底前，共軍曾先後向六合·揚州·南通·海門進攻達五次之多，其他各地向國軍隨時襲擊，始終未曾停止，此次共黨復調集龐大兵力，發動蘇北全面總攻擊，現在政府，已向軍事三人小組馬歇爾，共產黨代表周恩來、提出嚴重抗議。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕據糧食部發言人談稱：全國糧價，前因靑黃不接，致有一部份地區波動，近以各地雨量調勻，秋收望豐，普呈平疲之象。據近各大城市糧價觀測，南方各省米價，京滬一帶，南京糧源漸暢，供求相應，中熟米價每市石迄在四萬三四千元左右，惟上海前因來源稀少，供求失調，米價一度高漲，嗣因大批越米及川贛米源源運　以每石四萬六千元配售市民，漲勢已趨緩和，浙閩兩省旱稻收刈在即，米價勢見疲落，各地多在三萬至五萬之間，皖贛鄂各省近亦漸趨下落，川省跌勢更猛，渝上熟米已跌至一萬二千元，內江上熟米，竟落入萬元關內，滇黔兩省米價，迄在一二萬元之間，頗稱平穩。他如粵桂湘三省，前以災情嚴重，糧價升漲最高，近以秋禾生長良好，早稻漸次收割，價格節節回跌，如廣州，桂林已由十萬高價跌至六萬二千，及八萬五千，長沙跌降更多，現售四萬七千元，不久新轂登塲，各省米價可望普遍下跌。至北方各省麥價，亦因小麥豐收，普呈疲穩，尤以豫陝甘靑諸省更爲低廉，除西安蘭州各在二三萬元略高外，共餘多在一二萬元之間，冀魯晋各省麥價略高，如北平天津濟南靑島太原谷地，均已落至四五萬元上下。</p>

<p>教廷派遣公使（Internuncio）來華，提名李白麗總主教爲首任教廷駐華公使，業經我政府予以同意，並經在羅馬南京先後發表。李白麗公使何時得能蒞華，目下雖尙無確息，但是項消息，旣經公布，則教廷駐華公使館之設立，爲期當不在遠。繼首任國籍樞機之任命，公教會在華教會體制之建立，教廷之派遣公使來華，爲教會史上之創舉，即在我國，有教廷公使駐在首都，亦爲我國外交史上空前之舉。</p>
<p>查我國與教廷建立外交關係，正値太平洋戰事起後國際形勢緊急之會。其時日本派遣其駐在法國大使館之參事原田健爲首任駐教廷公使，共後又晋陞爲大使，一時梵蒂岡儼然成為國際外交中心，德義日等軸心國家旣有使節駐在其地，而聯合國方面之英美及拉丁美洲諸國亦有使節駐在教廷。我國爲爭取外交主動，同時爲抵制日本的措施，於民國卅一年春，開始與教廷建立外交關係的商談，成立協議，由我國派遣公使駐在教廷，而教廷則以原駐在中國之宗座代表賡續執行其職務。依據是項決議；我政府遂任命原駐瑞士代辦謝壽康氏為我國首任駐教廷公使；駐華宗座代表則以我國天主教重心在華北，地處淪陷，困難更多，乃不顧日寇橫暴與個人安全，仍　駐節北平，策劃教務，爲與我國政府保持聯絡計，並以重慶尙主教惟善爲副代表，在陪都設宗座代表辦事處。迨抗戰勝利，駐華宗座代表蔡寗總主教即自平飛渝，晋謁主席暨我政府各首長，報吿頻年爲維護教會事業與日寇苦鬥經過，旋即飛往滬漢香港各地，召開主教會議，聽取報吿，策劃將來教務發展計劃。</p>
<p>若干人士鑒於我國既派有公使駐在敎廷，而敎廷在華使節為不具有外交身份之宗座代表，以為我國與敎廷之外交關係，有往無來，似爲一種單程交通，因而主張要求政府令飭我駐教廷公使向教廷提出交涉，迅派教廷公使來華，以代替向之宗座代表。查教廷與各國維持關係派遣使節，原經審愼考慮。英國有國教，而派有公使駐在敎廷，但敎廷派往英國者為一不具有外交身份之宗座代表；美國杜魯門總統派有具大使地位之私人代表駐在教廷，而教廷派駐美國者亦爲一不具有外交身份之宗座代表。教廷公使之派遣，現只有荷蘭一國，此外，教廷或則派遣大使（Noncio），或則派遣宗座代表。今我國政府旣同意於教廷公使之派遣，是除荷蘭外，教廷派遣之使節中，又多一教廷公使矣。</p>
<p>月前田耕莘樞機歸自羅馬，道經上海，曾說教宗庇護十二世爲促進中國與教廷之關係，擬派遣大使來華。我　主席對我國與教廷之關係，向極重視，亦擬將我國駐在教廷使節昇格爲大使；乃此項計議現時竟不獲實現。若干人士以爲教廷大使按照國際慣例，應爲駐在國外交團領袖，或於我國情形，有所未便；殊不知正因我國情形與純粹之天主教國家若法義及拉丁美洲諸國不同，而又與英美有別，倘有教廷大使駐在我國而以之爲外交團領袖，正足以表示我立國精神之寬宏，爲英美及其它國家樹一典範。况教廷無政治上之企風，以教廷大使出任外交團領袖，猶足以表示其地位之超然。抑更有進者，自我國建立教會體制以來，我國已有正常之教會組織，不再爲傳教區域；尤宜崇其體制，互派大使，蓋依照國際慣例，公使代表外交部長，惟大使方能代表元首也。</p>
<p>梵蒂岡爲彈丸之地，不擁一兵一卒，從惟物的觀點言，其在國際關係中所處地位，原無足重輕。顧梵蒂岡以其地爲教宗之所居，爲世界最高道德權威之所寄。戰後世界之重建，千緒萬端，要以道德秩序之重建爲首要。以是之故，各國使節畢集於教廷；蔚爲國際外交之重鎭。我國爲無國教之國家，派遣大使駐在其地，正足以表示我對道德權威之重視，顯揚我先人所遺之光榮傳統。今我國旣與教廷建立正常外交關係，互派公使，深望在不久之將來，能有更進一步之發展，將公使昇格爲大使，用符我　主席及教宗增進我國與教廷關係之至意。</p>
<p>茲者教廷公使旣經發表，不久將來華履新；自民國十一年成立以迄於今之駐華宗座代表公署即將撤廢，現任駐華宗座代表蔡寧總主教來華十三年，即將返國。自有駐華宗座代表公署之設置以來，其間爲時逾二十年，先後經剛恒毅總主教及蔡寧總主教之努力，中國公教會及我國與教廷之關係，卒達成如今日之地位；吾人追念勳勞，對剛蔡兩總主教謹致感謝贊佩之誠。新任駐華教廷公使李白麗總主教，學識淵通，才幹練達，深信必能繼剛蔡兩總主教之後，於促進我國與教廷關係上，多所建樹；吾人僅於此表示歡迎之忱。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十五日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯本日發表廣播，報告巴黎四國外長會議經過。貝氏對於此次會議中關於德奧兩問題未有何項進度，歸咎於蘇聯，但亦承認對歐洲五戰敗國家之和約談判，前途現已趨明朗，因四國外長努力協議已獲成果，歐洲和會將於本月廿九日在巴黎召開故也。貝氏之言曰，會議中商定之各項和平草約，并非人類智譿之盡善，但亦確為人類在聯合國所承認四原則中所可獲得之最大智譿。此項條約批准後九十日，佔領軍務須撤退，僅留一部份部隊保護交通線。彼時被佔領各國之人民，可以生活及呼吸於自由空氣之中，吾人即踏上恢復和平之大道矣。以言德國及奧地利問題，余相信蘇聯難以了解吾人，一如吾人之難以了解蘇聯。美國提議之德裁軍計劃，得英法兩國之贊同，但蘇聯獨持反對，致告擱淺，實右扼腕。余以為四國管理德國辦法，辦理並不盡善，是以美軍事代表本星期內將奉令與英法蘇聯三國全體或其中任何一國，在重要行政問題如財政·運輸·交通·貿易及工業各方面實行合作。吾人如不在各佔領區間獲得經濟合作，即將擔負違反波茨坦協定之責任。至於奧地利問題，蘇聯堅持對該國締結和平草約以前，必須解決該國境風之難民問題及清除國社黨勢力問題，此種堅持亦屬不當。要而言之，吾人並不以為和平應以報復為基礎，吾人所信者為正直無私寬大為懷。吾人如出以仁慈與憐憫，則可化敵為友。吾人務必信賴和平，並祈求上帝憐憫賜與世界和平。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕美前駐蘇及駐法大使　立德，近著「大地球的本相」一書，指摘蘇聯。大意略謂，今日威脅全世界之極權帝國主義，厥惟蘇聯是已。蘇聯之外交政策，乃在全世界樹立共黨獨裁制度，美國若不立即採取各項步驟，制止其滋長，即須向之屈服。吾人被全世界視為泥足之巨人，唯吾人馬首是瞻之人民，已開始懷疑吾人是否足智多謀，堪當策劃自由與和平之工作。但美國擁用推行世界和平之壓倒一切的勢力，確為事實，吾人首先須反對進攻蘇聯之觀念。吾人賴有原子炸彈與龐大之空軍，故今日能較蘇聯為強大，並能加以摧毀。但若因為吾人知悉蘇聯政府意圖日後向吾人作戰，而先發制人對蘇作戰，此種行動，將降低吾人之道德標準，與共黨成為一丘之貉矣。然而此非吾人對於利用原子彈制止蘇聯帝國主義新罪行將猶豫不決一之謂，良以處決暗殺犯，并非不道德行為故也。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今晚發表全國性廣播，向國人報告最近巴黎外長會議之結果。演詞全文如下：</p>
<p>每次大戰之後，勝利國均感締造和平工作之困難及令人失望。即就獨立戰爭後之美國而言，其時亦有十三州在內政問題相持之下，歷時五年始制定保護國內恒久和平之憲法。世界和平之締造也，不同觀念等之彌補也，在在均須更大之容忍與諒解。覓取最完善之決策，接受之，然後予以實施；締造世界和平，必須具有此種，意旨與能力。一如戰爭之助長戰禍，吾人亦能以和平加強和平。因此，在去夏歐洲勝利兩閱月後，杜魯門總統與余在波茨坦決定設立外長會議，展開締造和平之工作，並心盡帶獲致各地之和平。就當時之情勢觀之，與德國締結和約顯需相當時日。德國既與聞其事之政府，吾人亦無規定日期譎詐德政府成立之協定。吾人應與義大利及其他軸心附庸國訂閱和約，亦為極其顯明之事。因義大利等國仍有政府，故吾人即在此方面展開工作。</p>
<p>巴黎和會</p>
<p>過去十月來，吾人消弭各強異見，草擬和約及準備召開和會工作之繁重，已為世界人士所深知。此項工作現已獲得完滿之結束，和會亦經決定於七月廿九日在巴黎召開。參加和會之國家除蘇·英·法·中·美外，並有其他參加與歐洲反軸心戰之國家十六單位。外長會議對和會之組織及議程雖有所建議，惟和會仍可自行決定其組織及會議程序。過去曾有小組委會會議應保守秘密之建議，惟經吾人反對後，此項建議已作罷論。余曾表示：就美國而論，認為吾人應將和會及其委會之會議內容儘量公開。和會之任務僅在提出各項建議；外長會議各會員則負責擬定和約之最後草案，並考慮和會之建議，不得無故拒絕其中任何一項。外長會議考慮和會建議，並贊同和約最後草案後，和約即由代表在和會休會前簽訂。</p>
<p>和約草案</p>
<p>經由各國贊同之和約草案，並非人類智慧之最佳結晶，惟確係人類智慧所能促使四強一致同意之最佳成果。和約草案，將顯示各國在戰雲密佈之世界中，對恢復世界之態度不僅代表總統及國務卿之意見，且代表參議員康納利及范登堡均富於外交經騐，且對訂立和約締造和平之工作均有深切之認識。</p>
<p>最大爭執</p>
<p>最大這爭執，在於義大利條約，而該條約保護層牽涉之最大問題，厥為特里埃斯特港以及沿伊斯特里亞半島西岸領土之命運。美代表在英法代表支持下，力主特港及其附近領土仍留與義大利，而屬於斯拉夫之內地，則歸於南斯拉夫。蘇聯竭力爭辯謂：特里埃斯特與附近領土，不應與其直接之內地切斷。蘇聯雖承認沿海岸數處城市與市鎮確屬於美國，但力主伊斯特里亞半島應視作整個領土，而既作為整個領土論，則其主權自當屬諸南斯拉夫。捷克亦支持此種見解。蘇聯更主張對於南斯拉夫之要求，較之對於義大利之要求，應予以更大之考慮，因義大利前為軸心夥伴之一，對於向盟國作戰及盟國數千人生命之喪失，應負責任；反之，南斯拉夫則始終與盟國併肩作戰，而遭受義大利之　壓。蘇聯與吾人彼此即均不準備讓步，於是否人提議將此問題提交和平會議，但蘇聯對此點亦不同意。因此吾人遂處於進退兩難之地位，較之大多數人所能想像者更為嚴重。</p>
<p>單獨訂約</p>
<p>吾人固不妨與義大利單獨訂立條約，置特里埃斯特於不顧，但蘇聯與南斯拉夫政府，以及其他若乾政府不願接受此種條約。吾人茍單獨訂閱條約，則蘇聯與南斯拉夫政府勢必要求義大利亦與彼等單獨訂立條約，而以特里埃斯特削讓與南斯拉夫。義大利若果拒絕，則不難預料種種困難將由此而起。即使無人向義大利提出條約。而已被解除武裝之義大利，亦僅能在我軍代為保守特里埃斯特之時期內抵制南斯拉夫之軍隊。為努力打破此種僵局起見，法國非正式提議：特港及其附近領土與義大利分離，但並不割讓與南斯拉夫，而由國際保證安全與完整。初時無人造成此種建議，嗣經細加研究後，此一建議似甚合理，足為彼此同意之基礎。按義大利在參加第一次世界大戰之前，曾建議特里埃斯特區應成為一自治邦。我代表團堅持該區應由聯合國保護，而不應依照蘇聯之建議，改由義大利與南斯拉夫政府保護者，同時亦不應依照法國之建議，由盟國四強保護。</p>
<p>特港主權</p>
<p>此一建議經最後同意，以北部之高里齊亞與蒙特法爾康歸於義大利，並將雙方同意之種族線以西其餘區域，包括在特里埃斯特自由領土內。誠然，特里埃斯特自由領土域內之主權屬於義國，域外之主權屬於斯拉夫，但該領土內之義人與斯拉夫人均非置於外國之統治下。彼等得有國內之統治，人民將選擇其自己之議會，而由議會中選出官吏以執行法律。彼等將受聯合國安全理事會及安理會所委派之公平監理人之監督。特港之繁榮與福利不但與義大利有關，且與南斯拉夫及中歐各國均有關係特港為中歐通往地中海之天然出口處，通入特港之唯一鐵道，係經過南斯拉夫而由南斯拉夫管理。南國政府代表力言：特港若果交與義大利，則彼等勢將移轉其交通至皇姆，或其他南斯垃夫之口岸。由於該區兩國民族之惡劣，故聯合國之管制，可謂免避武裝衝突與緩和緊張局勢之最好辦法。若以該區無論加入義大利或南斯拉夫，其對另一國之政治與經濟關係，必將蒙受損失。其工業或將不能吸收必要之資本，而勞工或將難以獲得工作。如能使特里埃斯特自由領土與各鄰國保持友好關係，則此一小小領土或可享受更大之繁榮，而成為各鄰國更大答疑解惑之泉源，較之無論加入義大利或南斯拉夫都要有利。余深信有關人士如能竭力合作，特港問題之解決方案既極公平，且有實現之希望。除非彼等合作一致，問題即無解決之一日。</p>
<p>義殖民地</p>
<p>對於處置義殖民地之問題，各方迄未獲致最後決策。吾人應記得蘇聯原有委任托治的黎波里之要求，蘇聯謂盼能於地中海區獲得得一商船基地。法國造成各殖民地交由義國委任托治之議，蘇聯亦於四月間表示願接受法國之建議。英國對於吾人將義殖民地交由聯合國委任托治之建議，除有關昔蘭尼加之間題尚待考慮外，亦表贊同。鑒於外長會議之困難，及殖民地問題有妨礙其他問題解決之危險，余將建議暫緩討論此一問題。卒經決定，最後處置殖民地之事，應由四強審度各殖民地人民之願望及其福利，並顧全他國利益及世界和平安全而決定之。四強如果能於和約生效後之一年內獲致處置殖民地之協議，自應依據聯合國大會所提處置殖民地問題之意見，加以處理，四強並同意派遣使國至各殖民地，調查當地人民之願望。在此一問題未解決前，義殖民地當仍由現有之英軍當局管轄。余對於此事甚感滿意，因殖民地問題之最後決定無須四強意見一致之必要也。縱令四強未能獲致協議，尚有聯合國可出而決定之。蘇聯終於收回其反對佔領杜特坎尼斯茲島之議。</p>
<p>賠償問題</p>
<p>賠償問題則尤為困難，蘇聯堅持至少應得義國賠款一億美元。此外，按照盟國與匈牙利，羅馬尼亞及芬蘭簽訂之休戰協定，上述各國應各付賠款三億美元與蘇聯。職是之故，蘇聯對義之陪償政策，亦難寬大為懷。另一方面，吾人則深感戰事結束前數月內義國曾予吾人以種種協助，故不欲其負擔賠償重荷，阻礙其經濟復員。吾人前曾同意，義國得以其境內之戰時工廠，及該國在匈·羅·保三國境內之義僑資產劃充賠償。惟蘇聯則堅持義大利之賠償應以貨幣或未來義國工廠造船廠之生產品支付。吾人雖無可奈何而同意蘇聯應得賠償一億元，惟吾人曾提出要求，認為：即使義大利係以其生產償付賠款，蘇聯應設法輸送此項生產品，免使義國經濟復員遭受障礙，同時吾人並要求蘇聯應寬限義方，於二年後開始支付此項賠償。為避免義國因製造蘇聯所得賠償品而向吾人借款購買原料計，吾人並要求蘇聯以必需之製造原料供給義國，義大利及他國和約仍有若干問題未能獲致最後協議。蘇聯代表團堅持主張非俟四強對各項基本問題之觀點已獲協議，蘇聯決不同意召開和會，吾人即認為蘇聯並不以此一問題為基本問題並將接受召開和會之決策。（待續）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海銀行公會理事長李馥蓀先生於四月杪出由美歸國後，本報記者曾一度訪晤，未克暢談，昨日再度往訪，記者提出若干問話，荷承面答，茲摘錄如左：（問）最近先生受政府任命，擔任最高經濟委員會會員，對於全國各項經濟措施之建議，可得聞乎？（答）鄙人受任後，最高經委會尚未開會，鄙人未有具體意見。私意以為吾國農工商業，向來落後，抗戰八年，人力物力，損耗極鉅，此後全國人力物力，均宜完全用於生產建設之途，切望承平時代真正展開，使各項計劃，可以實踐，建設事鉅，需要大量資金，吾人宜勤儉耐苦，積蓄資力，善為疏導，同時吸引外資，與之合作。吾人所應注意者，即資金之「疏導」與「吸引」。凡資金之活動方向，不外安全與利潤，故投資之安全條件與利潤條件，首須努力促成，則內外資金，定易趨集。至建設所需人力，其勞力一項，在我國頗為充分，各種建設開始，可使民眾職業問題有辦法，技術人才，我國尚感不敷，宜延攬外國人才，幫同工作，幫同訓練。（問）先生對於國營事業民營事業之界限有何意見？（答）關於此點，蔣主席在三十四年國慶前夕廣播演詞中，曾提示原則，並有具體之舉例，略謂「……國營事業與民營事業的種類，尤應有明確的劃分，……凡有全國性和獨佔性以及人民力量不易舉辦的事業，如鋼鐵工業，如全國鐵路，如大規模水電廠等，應歸國營，此外一經濟事業，均可歸人民寬營。……我們國家之建設計劃，應以民生福利為目標，人民的經濟自由，應受國家整個計劃的保育，這就是我國古訓「藏富於民」的道理。」又三十三年國際商務會議在紐約修理工會，鄙人亦為代表之一，曾奉政府電示，關於私有企業制度及商業政策等各要點，略謂，「……事業除不能委諸個人及有獨佔性者，應由國家經營外，凡可委諸個人或其較國營為適宜者，應任個人經營，由國家獎勵，以法律保護之。」又謂：「我國企業不論國營或民營，均得接受外資。」歸國以後，於上月赴京謁見蔣主席，復承面論，原定之方針及界限，決不變更，短時間即須實行。行政院宋院長亦曾迭次聲明戰後有若乾事業暫由國營一節，事屬權宜，將來必歸民營。是政府提示之原則，極為明確，界限亦頗清楚，但期早日實現，使企業家可以放心經營。（問）關於我國幣制改革之意見如何？（答）幣制以穩定為首要，且與其他經濟項目有密切關係，現在穩定工作之主要部份，已由中央銀行執行中，頗有功效。近來許多人士，認國幣匯率，定價太貴，此說固未嘗無理。但政府酌定現行外匯率時，實期力避物價之刺激與人民之損失，只須全國安定，交通恢復，生產增加，出口暢旺，則幣值自然可臻穩定。鄙人深覺中央銀行對國幣信用，極為重視，對現行匯率，決不肯輕易變動。從事黃金及外幣之投機者，恐不免自招損失。（問）對戰後國內財政金融情形之意見如何？（答）就金融而言，鄙人回國後觀察所得，目下與戰前相異者，第一為銀行增設甚多，第二為穩健的經營，殊未普遍。管見以為銀行營運資金之來源，主要者實為存款，現在銀行存款，就「質」而言，實際比戰前大為減少，且幾乎全係活期存款，其游離性極大，時來時去，在此種之情形之下，銀行放款業務，實有格外慎重之必要。假令銀行做不穩慎之放款，甚至於暗事投機，如買賣黃金美鈔或竟直接經營貨特之買賣等，則非但本身岌岌可危，且於整個金融市場及整個社會大有影響。銀行雖為營利社團，但營利目的而外，自應有其社會目的，與國家觀念。故穩健云云，實為積極方針，而並非消極態度。希望全體同業，勿圖僥倖，恪循正軌，不忘其社會目的與國家觀念，以共圖遠大的發展。（問）頃先生謂穩健的經營殊未普遍云云，事例如何？（答）各銀行中，承兌及票據貼現，做得不少，但其中不免有并非真實貿易而發生關係之票據，亦有並未取具確實擔保者，其承兌或貼現之手續，頗有與政府規定不合者，甚且有對於票據債務人之來歷與信用，毫不注意者。在歐美諸國，承兌票據，原為最良好最主要之信用工具，票據貼現，則為銀行最主要之授信業務。在我國商界及金融業，端宜審　名實，認真提倡，今若假此美名，加以濫用，殊屬大謬。此外又有遠期支票之所謂「保付」，尤為危險，且與法律規定，顯相抵觸。（問）最近六月底銀根奇緊，其故安在？（答）六月底銀根之緊，一由於工商業有大宗稅款，於月底彙總納繳，故各行莊之存款，因此驟然大量移入收存稅款之中央銀行。二由於銀錢業半年決算休假，連星期日共有三天，顧客收入現鈔，平時隨收隨存行莊者，因次日起休假而暫不存入。三則因大亞銀行之週轉不靈，引起市面不安。此在平常時經營穩健之行莊，則因其日常支付準備金，原保持相當高度，故支付能力仍有餘裕，且有臨時酌量拆與同業，略資輔助者。（問）聞中央銀行對於行莊中拆款請求，未肯允許，此點照中央銀行之立場與使命言，如何看法？（答）據鄙人所知，中央銀行目前所採政策，係注重於緊縮，管見以為在各種投機之風尚未平　，行莊營業未能普遍穩健之今日，此種政策，殊為適當，實則中央銀行對於穩健同業，如遇必要，當然肯加調劑；又遇各同業承做重要正當貸放而自己資力不敷時，如本年銀錢業之春　貨款等等，中央銀行亦曾為適當之輔助。（問）聞上海銀錢業聯合準備會即將組設成立，將來對各行莊想很有幫助，又聞上海票據交換所亦將改組，其辦法如何？（答）在廿一年「一二八」第一次淞滬抗戰開始時，上海金融業首先受到影響，支付能力驟然短絀，銀行同業緊急集議應付，共同發起創辦銀行業聯合準備會，集中財產，以事調劑；錢業方面，亦有聯合準備庫之創設，市面賴以穩定。其後在二十四年錢業發生風潮時，在二十六年淞滬二次抗戰時，在二十七年夏，銀錢業遭受提存風潮時，對同業以及社會曾有甚大貢獻，財政部三十二年七月，在重慶制定銀錢業辦理聯合準備會原則，通令各地推行，其辦法頗多採取上海原有制度。上海漁利之後，全市財政金融，均在整理之中，銀行業準備會及錢業準備庫因戰時之原有業務中，如同業存款及同業拆放等等，或另有適當之歸屬，或暫無需要，故銀行業準備會迄今尚在停頓中，錢業準備庫則已辦結束。銀錢業兩公會本年春間，鑒於本市金融業情形未臻穩定，同業之間，缺乏一互助之中心機構，乃有重建聯合準備制度之擬議。鄙人歸國之後，復興中央銀行當局相商酌，均認聯合準備制度，足為中央銀行之臂助，承其贊同。最近並已奉財政部批示准予組設，不久即可簽訂公約，今後同業一面雖有此集合實力之中心，一面仍須有力求穩健，自固基礎，有一致的步伐，庶集體安全，可以確保。吾人須知，新準備會組設之後，辦理同業拆放，亦不過於真正必要時，酌為臨時之調劑，而絕非可以對一般同業，當用供應營運資金。故同業對於新準備會，幸勿過存奢望。至票據交換所一事，從前銀錢兩業及外商銀行，係各自辦理，上年滬市光復，銀錢業遵照財政金融特派員示，組織統一的交換所，當時為統一工作迅速完成計，由中央銀行秉承財政金額特派員選任交換所委員，管理交換所事宜。鄙人歸國，適逢銀錢業兩公會改選完成，中央銀行當局以盟邦通例，凡在通都大邑，票據行使繁多之地，宜由金融業自組公益社團性質之票據交換所，專司票據之清算事宜，特囑銀錢兩業自選交換所執行委員，而由中央銀行監督，以符體制，經兩公會決議照辦。故交換所改組云云，實際僅為交換所委員之改選也。（問）先生對於現在本市市政之意見如何？（答）吳市長　任之後，以明快之作風，勵精圖治，如全市稅收之調整，足以減輕市民負擔，如米市之管制，與勞資問題之處理，其事均屬不易，措置均極賢明，此外對於社會風紀之整頓，亦復不遺餘力，中外視聽一新，輿論翕然。何秘書長為一賢良方正之學者，以戰前服務工部局及勝利後充任副市長之經騐，為吳市長之左右手，可謂相得益彰。私衷所希望者，即全市市民，應各明瞭市政興革，在每一市民，均有責任，對於公家設施，宜協助其推進，庶全市建設工作，愈臻順利。</p>

<p>商業新聞年息六厘貸額七成　出口打包貸款內容　憑信用證書者可轉抵押</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近中央銀行爲鼓勵出口計，曾倡辦出口打包放款，以資融通出口商之資金。記者爲明暸該項放款辦法起見，昨特趨訪某指定經營外匯之銀行當局，承吿：該項放款，自六月中旬起，即開始陸續辦理。大致分兩種：（一）持有信用證書之出口商，可持同信用證書，向指定銀行申請借款。指定銀行即依信用證書上所載金額，貸給七成借款。年息以六厘計算。出口商之貨品如已裝船，則即可持同提單，保險單，及信用證書上所開具之各項附屬單據，交卸予原貸款之指定銀行，辦理還款手續。指定銀行於接到是項單據後，除計算借款日起，至交卸各項單據時止之利息外；尙須加計利息一個月。因估計自郵遞出口商之各項單據赴美，至在美收到貨款時止，約須一個月之時間。又承辦是項借款之指定銀行，得憑出口商之信用證書，向中央銀行轉抵押，年息以四厘計算。該項借款期限爲三個月。（二）未持有信用證書之出口商，申請借款時，純由各指定銀行自行斟酌核辦。大致視銀行本身外匯頭襯之多寡，及出口商信譽如何，而決定貸給與否。該項借款期限爲六個月。惟中央銀行並不接受轉抵押。據悉：持有信用證書之出口商，其貨品每已裝運抵滬。反之，其貨品必多滯留他埠。以上兩種出口借款，出口商如中止將貨品裝船外運，或不按時將外爾結售予原貸款之指定銀行，則已放之款，將按國內通行之市折計息。同時將通函各指定銀行今後拒絕與該出口商往來。又據該指定銀行當局表示：希望中央銀行當局，對第二種出口借款，亦准指定銀行辦理轉抵押。且萬一出口商有發生毀約之情事時，指定銀行因此所損失之外匯，亦望中央銀行予以彌補。記者旋以此事詢諸關係方面，據吿：設中央銀行彌補此項損失，則不啻爲外匯資源開一漏洞，事實上礙難照辦云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司，昨日第六期配售食糖，遵照市府社會局之規定，以八萬元一市擔之價格，配售中砂共一五，三三〇包於糖業公會。此外尙直接配售中砂一，〇三〇包予糖菓廠及各消費合作社。</p>
<p>據悉：第六期申請購買之糖商，共二二五家。申請購買數額，共達五萬零八百包。而第六期規定之配售數，爲一萬五千包。故由社會局商訂辦法：凡申請五十包者，全數照配。五十包以上，一百包以下者，配售六十包。一百包以上，二百包以下者，配售七十包。以後每加一百包，加配十包。意旨所在，係希望糖商勿隨意亂塡申請數額，同時望於下次申請時，能按實銷數量塡寫。且據估計：每週配售食糖一萬五千包，足敷一般正常之需用。聞此項配售額中，百分之七十，係運銷外埠。現在存糖約九萬包，足敷六週之配售量。六週期間，將有大批台糖，陸續裝運來滬補充云</p>
<p>又悉：社會局吳局長於日前召集台糖公司及糖業公會洽談後，業經規定，每週二由台糖公司配售糖業公會食糖一萬五千包。昨爲第六期配售，每市擔標價爲八萬元。糖商轉售予糖號，每市擔不得超過八萬六千元，逾限將由市府嚴厲取締。下週二第七期配售時，每市擔標價將减爲七萬五千元。嗣後每週配售，糖價將逐步抑低，以期恢復正常之糖價。惟昨日市價，每市擔仍徘徊於九萬四千五百元之間。據熟悉糖業者估計：台糖公司以八萬元一市擔之低價，配售予糖商，糖商每包已有九九扣，及溢額糖二斤之利益，合計有定額利益三千〇四十元之譜。如每擔按八萬六千元之規定價格出售，則糖商每擔已盈利九千〇四十元。故若以昨日市價每擔九萬四千五百元而言，則糖商之利潤，實屬可觀云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨糖市初以台灣公司復有開售中砂白，人心見虛而跌，後以公司供給額不多，復趨上展，故土糖大都觀望未出，公會劃盤劃九萬二千元，旋破九萬關而至八萬八千元，午收爲九萬〇五百元，下午以上述原因，回至九萬三千五百元，四千五百元，號貨靑糖，行方還小二三千元，號方以成本關係，無售意，蓋照八萬之價，恐需虧耗也。</p>

<p>— 本報五日廣州航訊　特派員梁風</p>
<p>打了八年仗一切都有點變了！誰會想到？竟然連季候都有點不同，南國今年卻熱得特別的早，像這幾天來，熱浪向著廣州猛烈的密襲，使人們壓迫得幾乎窒息。由六月廿一日起，因熱極壓迫至死者，每日平均總在五十人以上，牲畜亦染上流行瘟疫，像這樣的奇熱，而且又熱得那末早，據說是廣州數年來所僅見的、</p>
<p>「解渴」第一</p>
<p>「霍亂」卻佔其次</p>
<p>由於連日的奇熱，人們都去找尋足以消夏解熱的地方，使廣州添上一片新的景象：吃冰店雖如雨後春筍，日有增加，但大都其門如市，應接不暇。市民解渴要緊，「霍亂」還是第二件事。各製冰廠汽水廠，賣至幾乎絕市，價格通漲上三次，還是供不應求。荔枝灣和珠江岸畔，都是消署的勝地，每屆黃昏，便遊人如織。游泳場更不消說了。無論西郊和沙面各游泳場，終日萬頭攢動，真是空前盛況；所以最近不少投機家都在計劃開設游泳場。聽說有人準備斥資一萬萬元，在按荔枝灣畔開設一個叫做「海角紅樓」的巨型遊樂場，那裏有游泳場，跳舞廳，酒吧，旅館，溜冰場，彈子房，音樂茶座等設備，真是應有盡有，如果這個遊樂場開設，那更使廣州人士，得其所哉了！</p>
<p>糧荒狂潮　似已安然渡過</p>
<p>在這半個月來，糧價是比較安定的。糧荒的狂潮，彷彿已經安危渡過；目前粵省各縣的糧價已漸漸下跌了。</p>
<p>據最近調查所得的報告：以全省三千萬人口計算，半年所需消費約六千萬市擔的糧食；而廣東全省耕地面積三千九百九十八萬九千八百九十六市畝，早造應有生產收獲六千九百餘市擔，但今年早造雨水不調，估計衹能收穫五成五，那就早造要缺糧二千二百多萬市擔，廣州市缺的大概是五百多萬擔。照這估計缺糧數字，本也相當可觀。不過，現在已經有了辦法，如閩糧三十萬市石，贛糧十萬石，和　糧一萬石都正在不斷的運輸來粵接濟。自然，省際交通是有著相當的困難，也許遠水不能救得近火，不過還有許多僑胞捐返祖國的救濟米，已經不斷的運來了。如暹僑捐返祖國的第五批散米賑米四千一百七十二噸，已經最近到了香港，據說這一批米的分配，是廈門佔二百噸，廣州瓊崖佔二千五百噸，潮梅各地佔一千四百九十二噸，這更可說是粵人的福音哩！</p>
<p>暹米之跡　迄今尚未揭曉</p>
<p>暹僑捐返的散賬米是一批批的運來，而上次暹米在港售賣的謎，至今還沒有揭曉。這裏代表民意的市參議會不斷的要和善救分署算救濟賬，可是算來算去，總算不清。</p>
<p>六月廿一日的市參議會常會，本來是請善救粵分署凌處長出席報告的，但凌署長那天卻沒有出席，衹派了一位許多問題都答不出的代表來，使參議員們非常不高興。於是決定在廿六日他們的常會，再請凌署長親自來報告，那鬼地方凌署長終於來了！參議員們最先提出。凌署長在上海對記者發表的談話，要他解釋，他衹說談話與原來發表不符，已去函請更正。同時他在滬答覆大公報署名錦才君的信件，其中有錯誤的地方，係一時疏忽，凌署長也　應道歉，這問題便草告了一個段落。但關於救濟的問題，各參議員就像機關槍一般的接著提出詢問，其中一部份總算已經答覆了，其中還有要待書面答覆的，有這幾個問題：　全省所得特資多少？廣州分配多少？分配標準怎樣？　遲到物資損失的總數是多少？　分署發表清　數目與工務局記錄不符，原因何在？　廣九公路因為麵粉問題，損失了一萬萬三千餘萬元，是何緣故？</p>
<p>席上朱參議員克勤曾高聲的問：「散賬團體米，何以實發六成五？其餘三成五飛到那裏去了？這種作弊的事實，衹有喪盡天良的人才做得出！」凌署長臉也紅了，衹好說：「我沒有聽到這事，不知道有沒有證據？」朱參議員卻說：「這是鐵的事實！」到凌署長退出會場的時候，朱參議員再將這話重說一遍：「請注意我的話，這是鐵的事實！」凌署長衹好點頭而去。</p>
<p>共軍北撤　綏靖工作發軔</p>
<p>粵省境內的治安。雖較好轉；但在東北江一帶三五成羣的匪幫，騷擾地方遺害商旅的事情，還是時有所聞。過去為了中共武裝人員未撤退，當局進行綏靖。工作非常困難；可是粵境的中共武裝人員，現已登輪北撤了。而且中共東江縱隊首領曾生·曾承認在廣東境內已無中共武裝份子，同時中共方面最近由第八小組美方代表米勒上校轉向廣州營提出保證：（一）截至六月廿日止，大鵬半島以北地區，已無所謂中共武裝人員。其他假冒名義匪類，中共不能承認。（二）中共保證此後決遵守諾言，不再在廣東作武裝鬥爭。</p>
<p>那末，粵境至少在目前是完全沒有中共武裝人員，縱有的都是假冒的匪類，所以這裏的軍事當局，便發動全面的綏靖計劃，限期三個月內，將各處土匪完全消滅。現在施行的軍事措施是這樣：（一）將全省國軍及省防保安團隊，從新分配任務。（二）迅速組織民眾自衛武裝，實行自衛治安，各縣自衛隊槍械統出省發給。（三）實施聯剿聯保計劃，分區召開各區治安會議。</p>
<p>現在北江區的會議已在六月廿五日舉行，粵贛邊區的綏靖會議已於七月一日召集。行營主任張發奎將軍已於六月廿四日和保安副司令一行官兵百餘人，親赴　江主持北江區和粵贛區的綏靖會議，並順便出巡東北江的防務，這樣今後粵境的治安，當不會再有什麼問題了吧。</p>

<p>— 本報三日桂林航訊，特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>沉悶的仲夏，蕭索的日子，冷涼到可怕的殘城。厭人的風雨遮蓋了陽光的照射，山山水水，平地都加上了一片不可捉摸的白霧，一直牽衍到人們的心房，那末憂鬱，那末抑滯，無黨地任意地變的氣候變得太離奇了，然而，變的何止是天氣？</p>
<p>虛偽的民主像生長在馬糞堆裏一朵鮮艷的毒菌，多少人費盡了九牛二虎的力量，爭著搶著去擷取一枚下來，掛在長袍馬褂的衣襟上。民主啊！馬糞的產品又何嘗不香？</p>
<p>議長的爭執　成為空前奇談</p>
<p>難產的省參議會還是那樣難產，議長的爭執造成了空前的奇談，電請內政部取決的時候，突然雙方（官話派的李任仁和白話派的陳錫　）又來了一次「協商會議」，希望在商談裏去解決議長的問題。結果呢？終於是「沒有結果」，又一次不歡而散。開「協商」會的原因，說起來是「王奶奶的纏腳布」，直率地說一句，是「事出有因」，多少有一點很像是「壓力」的作用在裏面，再要溯本追源，未免說來話長，太難為了民主二字了。唯其是羣龍無首，於是議會也就多少添了一點前所未聞的名稱，因為沒有議長，於是而有「主席會」，由一個行政區推一個參議員來輪流權充主席。唯其沒有成立議會，於是預備會議改了「談話會」，等到沒有議長的第一次大會第一次會議開過了，大概袞袞諸公選有許多絕非如此會議所能解決的問題，於是，休會兩天，發急的去爭取議長的問題了。結果呢，結果是「如上所述」。</p>
<p>首次會議　堅拒記者旁聽</p>
<p>還有，第一次會議中有一次笑不得笑不得的事件，便是參議會竟會貿然地拒絕記者旁聽。理由是甚麼呢？說出來請勿見笑，理由是：「此次會議係討論本身問題，恐怕各人爭辯激烈，以至面紅耳赤，大家不好看，所以暫時請記者退席」。</p>
<p>政治的憂鬱病，民主的幼稚病，生長在今日的中國，誰也怨不了誰。要好好，恐怕不會很快地好起來，爭爭吵吵，沒有公庭對簿，便已經算一團和氣，懂得個中三昧的小百姓，都會心照不宣的。</p>
<p>桂林的人們對於政潮的起伏，對於許多看不懂的爭執，似乎都很少興趣，太多的煩惱便到他們對那樣的事情冷得像一塊堅冰，有幾個錢的人在忙著打算怎樣重整家園，沒空去管身外的事。沒錢的人要忙著半夜扒起來，跑到桂西路的糧食供銷處去排隊買平價米，（米價在諸公的吵吵鬧鬧裏漲到六萬多七萬元了）。難民們對著街頭貼滿的「遣送難民，六月底止」的通告乾皺眉頭，大家都心亂如蔴，那裏有閒情逸緻去聽甚麼的決議，絕對比不上救濟麵粉若乾噸抵桂的消息來得賣座。</p>

<p>憂鬱的不止是政治問題，交通問題也像在推波助瀾地造成人心的不安。連日大雨山洪暴發，沖壞了就得修理。應在修理的時候，起了一個國道省道之爭，廣西省公路局正要派工修理渡口路面和橋樑的時候，交通部公路總局第三區管理局出面干涉，說道這是第三區管理局的工程，省公路局不應過問，拒絕省公路局進行修理，於是弄到兩個和尚便沒了水吃，各渡口一律停工，苦的只是苦透了擺在渡口的成行成列的汽車，你過不來，我過不去，司機先生望著江水發呆。爭！爭！爭！甚麼時候才爭得了？糧運在爭吵裏斷絕，旅客在爭吵裏賣光了行李，整個廣西的血脈就這樣爭到硬化！假如沒有一個「柳桂希鐵路十月通車」的消息安慰一下人心，真是太憤恨了。</p>
<p>殺人巨案　不久即將公審</p>
<p>憂鬱的氛圍里，比較刺激一點的事情，只有一件行將公審的殺人巨案。殺人的主犯是桂柳淪陷期間任「第二行政區督察專員」兼「保安司令」的倪仲濤和「柳州區民團副指揮官」郭雍章。被冤殺的是一個羅城縣長何文運，何文運在抗敵期間於桂北一帶打擊敵人是一個出名的縣長，卻被倪仲濤為了想兼攝羅城縣政而藉莫須有的理由槍斃了他，自然人心鼎沸，一致呼籲要嚴辦這一個糊塗專員。桂柳光復後，倪仲濤即被拘押，由桂林地方法院檢察處提起公訴，旋以案情牽涉重大，決定特別組織合議審判，預定下週開庭審訊。專員擅殺縣長而至瑯鐺入獄，在廣西的確少見。能夠懲辦一個專員，的確有不省的曲折文章在內的。</p>
<p>一件公案　涉及歐陽予倩</p>
<p>旬日來，桂林還有一件公案，牽涉到一個戲劇家的身上，這位戲劇家叫做歐陽予倩，為了桂林疏散前歐陽先生經手的勞軍物品有點不大清凈，到今天被人翻舊案，在報上質問「勞軍物品何處去」？歐陽先生滿肚皮不高興，答覆的是：「勞軍物品，已全數分送桂林駐軍各部隊，有據可稽」，惟「單據的負責人已散處各地」，所以還要「函促彙集，傳便公告社會」。末了，說他就要走了，不過為了足疾，所以「尚未成行」。奇怪的是留居桂林的文化人，給當地的人士都沒有一個好感。譬如說：穆木天先生在張莘夫慘案發生後，竟到處說「張莘夫是國民黨特務暗殺的。」這種論調，實在有點使人頭痛。文化人熱愛民主，值得佩服，但是信口雌簧，就難免不犯眾怒了。</p>
<p>放下筆來，向窗前一望，正見著一個瘦得像枯竹的難民坐在草地上，苦著臉，低著頭把肚皮上的皮帶一度一度的勒緊，一直把肚子勒得象一個口盅那樣大小，然後掙起竹杖，冒著雨，蹣跚地向公路走去，啊，這憂鬱的桂林城！</p>

<p>在戰爭時期，海軍應用的雷達裝置，現在成了協助運輸的重要儀器。航行的船只，因為得了雷達的引導，才克服了許多障礙，解除了不省危險。最近「李希蒙城」汽船，由曼利蘭州馬爾蒂慕駛往弗岸尼亞州諾福爾克，作一百八十五哩夜間航行，全賴雷達的引導，由此證明，雷達對於航行的重要性。</p>
<p>雷達裝置，包括兩部份：掌舵室頂上，裝一旋轉的墬雷達，天線船橋上，裝一接收指示器。此項裝置，可映出一百碼至三十二哩內的船只及沿海障礙物的圖象。</p>
<p>船隻試航時，由七時陰極射管上，映出海洋中碇泊的船隻和沿岸的景物，即使在濃霧中，也能映出清晰的圖象，其他如海中的浮標和小島，也能看得十分清楚。</p>

<p>主筆先生：上海生活之艱，是大家熟知的，即雇佛　人之代價，　漲增高，我想感覺頭痛的一定很多，不能不特予提出，請大家注意改善。</p>
<p>（一）娘姨：居住於上海的一班客　的人，大多數皆僱有娘姨一人或二人，此項娘姨，什九由薦頭店介紹而來，去年冬季起，一班闊老爺和財主，不問青紅皂白，只要僱到娘姨，薪工再大亦不怕，是以本年春初只要五六百元的，一躍而提高至二千元，再躍而至五千元，三躍而至一萬元，至最近居然要三萬至五萬元，至於薦頭店則從僱主方面，索酬勞費三個月薪工，如僱用娘姨為三萬元月薪，即須付以九萬元酬勞費，五萬元者則須十五萬元，僱日期只有一個月。過期娘姨倘然不做，薦頭店即不負責任了，另僱又要另付酬勞費。因之發生一絕大毛病，即各薦頭店每每串通許多娘姨，與僱主談好條件後，立即上工，做滿一個月後，則藉故辭工，薦頭店所取得之酬勞費，兩人對分，受害的人家極多。閱者諸君，處此情況之下，如何僱用，社會局對各薦頭店，似應有取締方法，萬不能任此騙局當存，貽害人民。</p>
<p>（二）自用三輪車夫：為辦公代步計，不能不自備一輛三輪車，比較零僱省得多，不意一班自用三輪車夫，心地異常之黑，自今年起，每月薪工由一萬元起，增加到五萬元或八萬元，膳宿均由僱主供給，猶　其少，近聞竟有要求增加至十萬元以上者，真駭人聽聞，鄙人特提出此一問題，國家所僱用之公教人員，每月薪水多少？保國衛民之國防軍士，每月糧餉多少？難怪均不及自用三輪車夫所得之豐！長此下去，大家全要去做自用三輪車夫，豈非笑話！似亦應由社會明文規定，自用三輪車夫每月薪工不准超過若干萬元，並可籍此防止鄉間農民來城市，改業車夫於農田生產上，不無裨益。（陶仲木）</p>

<h3 id="c147">中國畫走向何處？ <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 王瑛元</p>
<p>近年來中國畫壇之紛亂，簡直千頭萬緒，無所適從，因爲宋元精華已不能繼承，而正統畫派又未建立，西洋畫大量的吸收，引起國畫的不安定，這都是學術將有新發展的前奏，自然令人興奮，但可歎的是西畫與國畫的門戶之見太深，互相仇視，在藝專中爲了理論派系的不同，引起教授與教授間，同學與同學間的隔閡，幾乎連系與系之間的服裝上都看不順眼，當然在其他的學術中，也有類似現象，如中國文學系與外國文學系也很少和睦的，不過我覺得學術的長進，應該在理論上的切磋不必以意氣形之於外，專在人與人間去計較是非。</p>
<p>在目前之中國畫壇中，純國畫派與純西畫派是兩極端，理論的鬥爭，自然是必然的，但界於兩極端間之各分支流派太多，在形式與技法上分，有由洋畫素描脫胎，而用中國畫墨者，有由中國畫脫胎而具西畫構圖者，或帶西畫色彩者，畫人物時，有帶西洋解剖者，也有純西畫形式，而取國畫題料及意境者。總之其中互相錯綜，幾乎分不清，而各小派之間，也各持我見，互相唾駡，什麽中西合璧，什麽中日分家，什麽油畫布比宣紙好，毛筆比刷子强，什麽色彩强烈比淡雅又好，出世更佳，鬧得異常紛亂，其實應該明白藝術品產生的各種背景與要素，及藝術發展大勢，就可避免形之於外的衝突。</p>
<p>在人類文化進化史研究結果，大概可以知道，每一次其他文化茂盛的時候，新藝術總在萌芽，待後再燦爛發展，很少有藝術居於領導地位的，而文化發展趨向，又是決定於地域環境，時代背景，哲學思想，宗教信仰，民政特性，外交，內政，經濟，交通等等，產生藝術時，除上述要素外，還加上什麽氣候材料……等因素。因爲藝術品是要經過兩個關鍵的，一是作家心理條件，二是社會公決，如違背上面各條件因素的藝術品，即令產生，也要受自然淘汰而沒落，當你創作超時代的藝術品時，社會遠無能力接受，而被指摘的，當你永遠不長進的話，也更要受社會唾棄。前些年，當歐洲各新畫派（馬蹄斯與畢卡素之流的）一度的勃興，究竟如曇花一現，馬上成了藝術史的跡，我國一度提倡，結果學野獸派的，學立體派的，後來也變成畫中國畫了。</p>
<p>但是時機沒有成熟的時候，是絕對不能折衷的，勉强的拉湊，成了不倫不類的東西，就是說正統新派的產生，不是這麼簡單，一定要文化交流，（據徐悲鴻教授說要待中西大量通婚）產生了新文化的時候漸漸使中西藝術溶成一爐，就新國畫言，到那時候才有真正的新派國畫，絕不是目前一般畫家，帶一點西畫色彩，與構圖的，就名爲中西合璧，更不是這麼容易。</p>
<p>到那時候，這新派將成爲一種什麽姿態出現，我們可以推測，在製作原料上講，將有新工具新材料發現，取材方面，範圍一定加大，並題材標準要轉移，筆法與筆力可能保持，內容方面因受外來新文化影響，有所改變，但因爲中國有數千年之傳統文化，哲學背景，民族性，人生觀等，故所表現的意境，絕不致將過去精華全部摧毀，而全取西畫以代之。</p>

<p>— 中原</p>
<p>六年前，我們家裏有一個年輕的女傭，名字叫阿翠。</p>
<p>她是個十七歲的鄉下女孩子，雖然說不上美麗，但一副尖尖的瓜子臉，還算生得端正。剛出來時只有十五歲吧，穿着柳條布短衫褲子，紅洋襪，綠鞋子，油膩膩的大辮上縛着二段粉紅絨頭繩，臉上搽着粉，手指甲用鳳仙花染過，紅豔豔地。這打扮，在鄉下真可以去吃喜酒，但到了城裏，未免有些屈氣。我對她的辮子望望，忍不住笑了出來。想不到她很靈敏，第二天早晨到我房裏來掃地時，帶着一把剪刀和一隻木梳，笑嘻嘻的向我道：</p>
<p>「小姐，我知道你昨天在笑我的辮子。在鄉下，我早聽說城裏姑娘統統剪了髮，我同娘吵，她總是不許剪，現在出來了，娘管不着我了。小姐，聽說你是會剪頭髮的，謝謝你，替我把辮子剪剪，好嗎？」</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道我會剪頭髮的？」我詫異着問。</p>
<p>「怎麼不知道！隔壁小香姐告訴我的！」笑嘻嘻地跨前幾步，站在我面前說着，「小香姐姐說，連她們大少奶二小姐的頭髮都是你剪的，說你剪得比剃頭司務還好哩！」</p>
<p>替阿翠剪辮子時，我發現這鄉下姑娘真是有些了不得，她非但靈敏，活潑，善交際，並且來了才一天，就已結識了隔壁的大姐小香。拆開她那條油膩膩的大辮子，斬斬兩剪刀剪下去後，一抹白色的東西出現在她的後頸上，我用手指去抹抹，有些黏，放到鼻子上嗅嗅，一點不錯，正是我放在樓下樹裏那瓶新買的「愛的霜」！</p>
<p>阿翠的愛漂亮，似乎有些愛得過度。禮拜天晚上，逢道天好有月亮，母親總喜歡帶我和小弟出去走走。記不起有多少次，我高高興興携着小弟的手從外面回來，上樓跨進自己的房間，總被鏡子前阿翠賊忒嘻嘻的臉孔嚇得一跳。我連棉帶單共有的十幾件旗袍，大概沒有一件不被她試穿過；我的絨綿外套，皮鞋，甚至長統襪子，她也都要「嚐嚐滋味」。</p>
<p>不過我不能不承認阿翠是個難得的好傭人；她伶俐，敏捷，更善於鑒貌辨色。任何事情，不等人說，先安排得整整齊齊。有時候看見我悶悶的不大高興，她便自動地替我到隔壁雲芳家去借些小說書來，問我道：「小姐，看看書解解悶吧！」</p>
<p>阿翠十六歲生日那天，母親賞給她四塊錢，叫她自己到館子去吃碗麵，餘下來再揀中意的隨便買些吃；她謝着微笑地出去了，半天還不回去。我心裏猜想那四四塊錢她一定捨不得買來吃，準是去買些衣料，胭脂，絲襪等東西。不料傍晚她回來時，手裏空空，並無東西帶回。我問她是否去吃過麵，她搖搖頭，張開嘴巴向我笑時，一顆亮晶晶的金牙齒出現在她嘴裏！</p>
<p>愛美當然不能算壞事，但阿翠的壞，確乎是從愛美而來。自從裝金牙齒那天起，她漸漸不大安分了。只要一有空，就偷偷溜出去，一去總是二三個鐘頭。她更一天四五次拼命把鵝蛋粉搽上臉去，恨不得搽成牆頭一樣白。香肥皂，雪花膏，花露水，已經統統全備；灶間裏的擱檯板，差不多成了她的化妝台。</p>
<p>一天我在街上走，起先太陽好好的，忽然下了陣雨。我本想冒着雨奔回去，但一轉念淋得一身水，傷風或發起老毛病來，不是小事，所有跨到一爿店家的階沿上去躲雨。</p>
<p>我沒有留意對面是爿什麽店，躲雨的人不止我一個，前面像屏風一樣站了一排，遮住了我的視綫。突然在嘩啦嘩啦的陣雨聲裏，發出一串「格格格格」的尖笑聲，我驚訝地從前面二個老頭兒肩隙裏透頭去向對面一望，才知那是爿鑲牙店，只見一個二十歲左右的小夥計，站在店門口和阿翠調笑着……</p>
<p>我自己也找不出理由，竟會把那事深深瞞起。不過到底瞞不住，有一夜阿翠試試看等我們睡靜後，開了後門溜出去，終於被母親發覺，立刻出去追尋，結果在一家小客棧裏，找到了她和那牙齒店裏得小夥計……</p>
<p>小夥計的名字叫阿順，聽說第二天就被老板歇掉。阿翠則由母親託人帶信到鄉下去告知她娘，以防再有別的事發生。</p>
<p>阿翠的媽是個三十多歲麻臉吊眼的婦女，其實不是她的娘，是她的婆，阿翠是從小領來的童養媳，只因還沒有併親，兒子就死了，便把阿翠當作了女兒。新年鑼鼓敲得熱鬧的一天，阿翠的娘從鄉下趕出來了，帶着些紅糖粗鬆糕，蘿葡絲　　子，長梗菜，一見人，「恭喜發財」，喊出一大串。</p>
<p>那天晚上，阿翠披散了頭髮，眼淚鼻涕淌了一面孔，蹬着脚，哭喊着：</p>
<p>「我死也不回去的呀……我死也不回去的呀……」</p>
<p>「小賤貨！你大年初一敢在太太小姐門口裏不吉不利的罵，看我不撕爛你的嘴……」阿翠娘的吊眼往上一豎，啪的一幾打過去後，回頭看見我在旁邊，就帶些歉意地道：「小姐！一接到太太的信，我早就想出來把這小賤貨收拾回去，但是正碰着田忙，實在走不出，弄到新年頭上來攪擾你們，真正對不起哇！……」</p>
<p>第二天朦朦亮，阿翠提着一個包裹到我房裏來告辭，眼泡腫得像胡桃，喉嚨裏還在一抽一噎。見了我，又是一大堆眼淚滾下來，嗚咽好久，似乎有話不敢說。再三問她，才說阿順住在西門包家弄十五號門牌，她沒有法子去和他告辭，要叫我想法爲她給個信，說她已經被媽逼着回去了。</p>
<p>「小姐：你告訴阿順，我是死也不忘記他的，……我死也仍舊要出來的！……」我答應替她想法後，她一面嗚咽，一面咬咬緊牙齒那樣說。</p>
<p>那天早晨阿翠的樣子我真忘不了。他哭得成了個淚人兒，尖尖的瓜子臉一陣陣發着白。我扶她走到房間門口，將二塊新買的花手帕塞到她的手心裏說：</p>
<p>「這兩塊手帕，我送給你作個紀念。你別傷心，阿順那種小夥子也許靠不住，你年輕，上了當來不及！你家中有田地，你媽領你回去是爲了愛護你……」我沒有說完，她嗚的一聲搶了上來說：</p>
<p>「小姐：你不必勸我，…嘔嘔！…我已經看穿了，…田地是假的，爺娘是假的，…除了阿順，天底下沒有什麽是真的，…我已經看穿了，…看穿了！……」她跨出我的房門，又回過頭來向我說了聲：「小姐：…請你不要忘記！…我已看穿了，天底下只有阿順是真心的…嘔…」才哭哭啼啼的跟她娘去了。</p>
<p>阿翠回去後，半年沒有消息。一天不知那裏來了個鄉下老婆子，手裏捏了個紅紙包，一扭一扭走進我們的天井，高聲喊着：「這裏是張家嗎？阿翠姑娘叫我送塊喜糕來給太太小姐阿官吃哩！」</p>
<p>聽見「阿翠」，大家一驚。母親招呼那老婆子在客堂裏坐後，問道：</p>
<p>「阿翠嫁人了嗎？嫁給什麽人？」</p>
<p>「嫁了個忠厚厚的小倌人，……」老婆子鬼鬼祟祟向四面一望，低聲道：「這裏沒有外人，說說不妨，阿翠姑娘自己看中的呢，是她們鄰村一個叫林生的小夥子。起先她媽不肯，後來林生託人出來說了幾次，才肯了。上月定親，這月初三就做喜事，一對小夫妻，真恩愛呢！」老婆子說得眉花眼笑起來。</p>
<p>阿翠結婚後第一次上城來玩，是秋末菊花盛開的時候。我還想得起她插在頭髻上那朵淡紫色的小菊花裏有個小毛蟲，我爲她捉掉後，問她：</p>
<p>「怎麼你又把頭髮留起來了？你不是特地叫我替你剪掉的嗎？」</p>
<p>「鄉下都梳頭的，林生叫我留起來，我自己想留了也好，因爲……」她沒有說下去，却愉快又害羞地望了望自己的肚子，那肚子很高，她告訴我結婚才三個月零十天，不過她肚子裏的孩子，看來至少已有六個月大。</p>
<p>吃過中飯，阿翠叫我陪她上街去買些小孩衣料。無意中又走過那爿鑲牙齒店，我對她看看，看她若無其事地並不朝那裏望，我便問她：</p>
<p>「阿翠，你還記得阿順嗎？」</p>
<p>她略略一頓，但隨即笑了，向我道：「小姐，你真好記性！什麽阿順不阿順！小姐，不瞞你說，我是看穿了，天底下只要和和善善的男人，都是一樣的！阿順待我有真心，林生也有真心，…」說到這裏，她轉過頭來對我一笑，那顆金牙齒依舊在她嘴巴裏熠熠地發着亮。不過除了金牙齒，她臉上還有一樣亮晶晶的東西，就是她的一雙眼睛。我看出，她眼睛裏露浸沉後，愉快而滿足。</p>
<p>阿翠臨走時，說生了孩子要送紅蛋來給我們，可是過了一年還部送來。有人說她的那個村莊不太平，來了東洋鬼搶劫放火，村人大半逃往別處。</p>
<p>想不到又隔了一年，那麼一個陰淒淒的下午，阿翠又來了。</p>
<p>連小弟弟都覺得有些奇怪，拉住我的衣袖連連問道：「怎麼阿翠變得這樣難看了呢？」她好像老了十歲：雖然頭上依舊光光地梳着個髻兒，但頭髮脫落得剩下薄薄一片，又發着枯黃。她的深藍布罩衫還是在我們地方做的，已有了　　的破洞。她低下被太陽晒成酱黃色的臉，望着手裏的包裹，叫了聲「小姐……」眼睛就紅了起來。（未完）</p>

<p>公路如一條敷糖的帶子，無數蟻車著附在上面，爬行在上面。</p>
<p>車又如成串的小鴨子從蜿蜒的小河上游來了。</p>
<p>車行了，車尾拖着一捲　灰哼着「突…突…」的歌聲，歡情地從平直的坦途上急馳而來，機警地忽然出現於山彎，忽然消逝於谷地。</p>
<p>開花的日子，溫情的春風，吹散到大地上一片片艷麗的顏色，沿路側的桃花以其美豔的面容，迎接着車子；遍山野的李花與櫻花，也以其素色的花蕾向旅人招手，向車中人招手。幸福的車窗，便不斷在展映着花枝，羅列着姹紫與嫣紅，而旅人乃有着依戀，有着溫馨的旅夢。</p>
<p>你看那草原，那平整地牧馬的草原啊，爲什麽那兒沒有打球的蹴球的呢？淳樸的　馬，該都未到過都市未看過那馳騁在都市的Jeep我們這條長長的奔馳迅捷的車隊，更與牠們生疎了，牠們注視以驚異的眼色，兩耳直豎着。</p>
<p>多麼遙遠的山嶺啊，數不清的臂脈，數不盡的迥峯，數不完的林木與深谷。公路的帶子，路上是沒有人跡的，沒有園亭與家屋，多麼荒涼啊，多麼粗礦啊，多麼寂寞而恐懼啊。</p>
<p>到另一省界了，澄碧的小河，從遙遠的山谷裏躜出來，一排排兩岸的長竹，以其狐尾巴式的長帽，彎向着小河，彎向着公路，彎向着勞頓的旅客。</p>
<p>我久不見芭蕉了，依然是以片片綠色的手掌指向着車子，招向着車子，而那成隊的又似手掌與手掌相牽連着的，是列隊歡迎嗎？我感慰地遙語着：「別來無恙？」</p>
<p>依然是一疊疊半月形的水田環繞着山　，映照着一叢叢山頭的竹柏；依然是葱綠底蠶豆與麥苗的簪珮，熙熙攘攘的蜂蝶在飛繞着，巡迴着。</p>
<p>繞過一個山頭後，便遙望到大江了，澄潔的沙岸，鑲襯着漫漫的長流，依風的白帆展翅般飄向遠方，兩岸橋林，桂元林中的鳥聲與水流聲，更在遙遙地應合着大地是一片綠，一片豐滿而和諧啊。</p>
<p>夜裏，我獨坐在沿江的酒樓上，憑望江邊的漁火，憑望着望不見的遠方人。</p>
<p>轉上成渝公路了，多麼繁華聞名的公路啊，但爲什麽有如許的皺紋，如許的浪呢？是養路工人怠職了嗎？是路局的主管人忘懷了嗎？可憐我們底車子，我們竟如是顛蕩而不安，如是幾乎翻沉於路之海中啊！</p>
<p>就要在明晨離開這兒，離開這沱江岸的小城了，我担心那分別許久的另一個城市的太生疎，行前發了一張電報，「××我準於東十五時抵×希至××車站等我，」從電報局出來時見山水的遠方霧似地濛濛着，我又將走向那濛濛的所在了，我墜於濛濛的夢中。</p>

<p>日子久了，引起一位女教員的注意，女教員並不知道麗華是何許人，只以爲她是一個好學而無力求學的孩子。因此動了同情之心，有一天當麗華又要跑出去的時候，便喊住了她。</p>
<p>「你是不是想念書？」女教員問麗華。</p>
<p>「是的。」麗華低着頭紅着臉回答。</p>
<p>「從前上過學嗎？」女教員又問。</p>
<p>「沒有。」麗華搖搖頭說。</p>
<p>「把你手裏的小本子給我看看。」女教員用對待學生的口吻，向麗華要她那個小本子看。</p>
<p>麗華不肯，又羞不怕，把小本子藏在背後。但是猛不防被淘氣的麗雲搶了去，遞給了女教員。女教員看罷驚訝地望了望麗華說：</p>
<p>「你寫的很好哇，你不像沒有上過學的。」</p>
<p>「從前跟父親念過書，只是沒進過學堂。」麗華囁囁地說。心裏感到一種喜悅。爲女教員的誇獎而喜悅！</p>
<p>「那麼你爲什麽不上學呢？你是什麽地方人？你家裏在這裏做什麽事情？」女教員是像盤問一個新學生。</p>
<p>麗華被女教員問得有些窘，她不知道應當怎樣回答才好。正在這時候，麗雲使搶着面答了：「我們是北京人，我姐姐——」麗雲剛說到這裏，被麗華悄悄扯了她一把，制止了。</p>
<p>女教員看見這種情形，也就不願再問下去，立刻拿了基本書給麗華，拍着她，慈祥地說：</p>
<p>「這幾本書，你拿回去看。有不明白的地方直管問我。還有，你要是聽得懂這裏的課，你就每天到這裏來旁聽，我們可以免收學費。」</p>
<p>「謝謝您！我以後一定常來跟您請教！」麗華感激地說罷，行了一個禮，　着麗雲走了。</p>

<p>陰曆五月二十五是我的生日，每年逢到這個日子，朋友雪芳總是要送我一點東西。今年她從郵局裏寄了一封信來，裏面有一張空白的信紙，和一首簡短的小詩，如此寫着：</p>
<p>——前年今天，</p>
<p>我送給你一朵鮮紅的玫瑰，</p>
<p>不料你接過手來，</p>

<p>不料你拿到手裏，</p>
<p>就放到眼邊去揩抹淚水。</p>
<p>今年今天，</p>
<p>我決定改變方針，</p>
<p>送給你一張空空的白紙，</p>
<p>不知你能否懂得我的意思？——</p>
<p>把這首小詩讀了幾遍，我提起筆來，回了這麼一首小詩給雲芳：</p>
<p>——我懂得你的意思：</p>
<p>生命是一張空空的白紙。</p>
<p>我懂得你的意思：</p>
<p>我能將這張白紙描繪得錦繡燦爛，</p>
<p>也能將這張白紙　抹得污跡斑斑。</p>
<p>一切都聽憑我自由的意志。</p>
<p>所以我懂得你的意思：</p>
<p>我應當小心我自由的意志！</p>
<p>我應當珍惜這張生命的白紙！</p>

<h3 id="c152">一九六零年前　蘇聯不敢作戰 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>美蘇兩國在最近的將來是否會發生戰爭？這是一個舉世所關心而似乎是任何人所不能解答的問題。美國「商業金融週刊」刊載了保繩，荷蘭的一篇文章，對於上述問題提出了一個大胆的答覆。現在把其中的要點節譯在後面，關心國際政治者可以當做一種參考。</p>
<p>據荷蘭的意見，這個問題的答覆可以從史太林所提出的一連串簡潔的數字中的看出來。這些數字說明蘇聯現在起到一九六〇年爲止三次五年計劃的內容；它們顯露出來史太林得目的何在。</p>
<p>雖然蘇聯的許多五年計劃完全是關於經濟方面的，但是同時可以當做蘇聯政治軍事的風雨表看。現代的戰爭，到底是建築在經濟力量上的。假如士氣和領導等因素都相等，戰爭常常是由具有最大工業生產力量的國家獲勝。尤其在原子時代，一個國家的作戰力量決不能根據它武裝力量的數量來判斷，決定的因素還是它的技術制度的功能和範圍：它的工廠，科學家，工人和原料。</p>
<p>史太林所提出的數字顯示這一點：就是蘇聯和美國比較起來，力量上幾乎相形見絀。縱使史太林決心和美國作戰，至少他能希望在一九六〇年前出此一着。</p>
<p>他最近的誓言，顯示史太林是熟知蘇聯力量的限度的；這些演說的內容，防禦性質重於進攻性質。爲了保證蘇聯不怕人家攻擊，它必須堅强。同時力量是一種相對的東西，所有史太林主張蘇聯的工業制度第一步應該達到這個目標，需要十五至二十年的時間。</p>
<p>例如，到一九六〇年的時候，蘇聯希望它的鋼生產達到每年五六萬噸的程度，而美國在一九四五年得鋼生產量就有八千萬噸。蘇聯在一九四〇年的鋼產量祗有一千八百萬噸。</p>
<p>蘇聯力量薄弱的另一徵象，就是它銑鐵生產的有限。去年美國生產銑鐵五千四百萬噸，可是蘇聯到一九六〇年的時候也不過生產五千萬噸。</p>
<p>石油的產量是衡量一國力量的另一尺度。一九四〇年，蘇聯生產石油二萬萬一千七百萬桶，到一九六〇年的時候，希望把這個數目提高到四萬萬二千萬噸，但是和美國目前的產量比較起來，還祗及四分之一。</p>
<p>一國的工業力量也可以從它的運輸系統來判斷。蘇聯的鐵路軌道，約計五萬八千英里，其中許多是單軌的。美國有鐵路軌道二十四萬一千英里以上，比蘇聯多出四倍以上，至於在各種氣候之下都可以使用的公路，蘇聯簡直極少，而美國有主要公路三百萬英里以上。</p>
<p>蘇聯希望在一九五〇年得時候年產汽車一百萬輛，而到那時美國製造商每年可以生產六百萬輛了。</p>
<p>這種比較，目的並不在否認蘇聯的進步。蘇聯的收穫的確實極大的，但是從世界的目光看，自由其限度吧了。</p>
<p>史大林的計劃特別重視四點，就是蘇聯的土地，食物，資源和人民。蘇聯的領土比美國大三倍，食物方面雖然暫時有缺乏的現象，但是擴大農產的希望幾乎是無限的。至於資源蘇聯對於每一種重要的礦產幾乎都有充分的蘊藏，即使有幾種不夠，也發明了適當的代替品。此外人口的眾多，也是史大林注意的一種因素。</p>
<p>根據這幾點，史大林認爲蘇聯可以急其直追，趨上美國，因爲照史大林的理論，美國的生產在未來二十年，因爲受資本主義的約束，至多不過保持原狀，甚至有發生不氣景的可能。</p>
<p>但是蘇聯極不願意美國發生不景氣的現象。這倒不是史大林對美國有所偏愛，而是爲了另一個理由。因爲美國一旦在經濟上發生了困難，可能從事軍火生產以謀出路；這是補救事業的應急辦法，如此，就有迫使其他國家實行軍備競爭的危險。</p>
<p>當然，蘇聯的領袖希望蘇聯生長，但是同時也希望美國不致遭遇困難而依然强盛。美蘇兩國在工業上處於平等地位，乃是蘇聯認爲建設和平世界的方案。</p>
<p>所以荷蘭的結論仿佛是：在一九六〇年前，蘇聯在工業上沒有趕上美國的時候，是不敢貿然一戰的。</p>
<h3 id="c153">圖示蘇聯努力增加生產的情形但在十五年內還是追不上美國 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>

<p>— 家南編輯</p>
<h3 id="c156">「否決權」專家羅米柯 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會五個永久會員國的「否決權」問題，的確是很微妙的題目。有許多人以爲它足以妨礙安理會採取有效的行動，也有以爲它是一種保障，可以防止一國的主張被其他國家所抹煞。事實上，「否決權」這東西，我們可以把它當做國際能否真誠合作的風雨表看，愈是使用得少，也愈能表示各國的合作無問。當然在目前的情形之下，一時還無法把「否決權」取消，祗有希望時間來把它沖淡，使它消滅於無形。</p>
<p>截止目前，使用「否決權」次數最多的，當推蘇聯。</p>
<p>蘇聯在安理會中遭遇了暗礁，它就使用這種權力，全世界對於這一點，已經是司空見慣了。蘇聯爲了對抗民主國家的多數起見，就使用「否決權」來保護自己。但是假如聯合國在每一個問題上必須向少數國家低頭，簡直就無法工作。</p>
<p>一年前，在舊金山會議的時候，蘇聯最後和其他大國同意，就是「否決權」的使用，應限於對國家採取懲罰行動的時候，而對於程序問題之類次要的問題，不應予以使用。蘇聯和美，英，中共同聲明過：「我們不能假定安理會的永久會員國會運用「否決權」故意來阻撓它的行動」。但是在五個月內，蘇聯就使用過「否決權」兩次來反對和平解決的決議，並且對於非懲罰性質的問題，也有使用「否決權」的意向。</p>
<p>我們現在把蘇聯使用「否決權」的次數，列舉在下面：</p>
<p>（一）今年一月間，加拿大的潘爾遜所以未能被選爲安理會秘書長，就是因爲蘇聯反對而使用「否決權」相威脅的原故。</p>
<p>（二）二月間，蘇聯否決對英法軍隊退出敘利亞和黎巴嫩的信任議決案。（目下全部軍隊已經退出敘利亞，留駐黎巴嫩的軍隊也幾乎全部退出了）。</p>
<p>（三）三月間，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯爲了不能使安理會其他會員國相信聽取伊朗大使艾拉報告的決議也屬於「否決權」範圍之內的問題而一走了之。</p>
<p>（四）四月間，葛羅米柯對於設立調查弗郎哥西班牙小組委員會的建議拒絕投票，用意無他，顯示他有「否決權」在握，雖然並沒有予以使用。</p>
<p>（五）六月下旬，葛羅米柯反對西班牙的決議，其主要原因是蘇聯反對將此項問題向聯合國全體大會提出。</p>
<p>下一天，蘇聯又堅持在管制原子能力方面保持「否決權」，反對美國主張取消它的見解。在美國看來，假如任何國家具有「否決權」，世界對原子能就無法作有效的管制，但是葛羅米柯却說，「無論如何，「否決權」應予以保持」。</p>
<p>「否決權」是消極的東西，不是積極的工具，它的出現，說明了國際間尚有間隙，聯合國的效力還部能充分發揮。我們不妨可以這樣說：「否決權使用的次數愈多，離聯合國的理想也愈遠。」但是假如國際的正義能夠日益昭彰，「否決權」的魅影是會被光明所衝破的。</p>
<h3 id="c157">怎樣投下原子彈 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 君默譯自星期六晚郵</p>
<p>駕駛了飛在三萬呎上空的超級堡壘，在廣島投下歷史性的第一顆原子彈的蒂倍茲上校，親自敘述了這個戲劇性的動人故事。</p>
<p>在尤他，一望無際的飛機場上，B29式超級堡壘在肉眼所望不見的高空飛着。秘密的第五〇九混合小隊在那裏訓練。駕駛員練習急劇的轉彎，回航，和分毫不差的投彈。五〇九隊的航空員受着原子彈轟炸的訓練，但不知道有着原子彈這個東西。他們只聽見說：「我們在尤他機場所學的可能會結束戰爭。」他們相信了，服從了指揮。</p>
<p>直到一九四四年八月，我也還不知道有原子彈。然後，我收到父親從邁亞米奇寄來的一封奇怪的信，問：「你近況若何？有些特別的人來調查關於你的情形。你是否出了什麽事情？」</p>
<p>不到一星期，我奉召去見第二航空隊的司令安特少將。一位陸軍情報軍官把我拉到一邊，問了我一個問題。這是我對祖國的忠誠的最後試騐。我通過了，於是他們告訴了我關於原子彈的事情。</p>
<p>我們的訓練完全是秘密的。當一架五〇九隊的飛機起飛時，沒有一個人知道它是向那裏去。有時候我們在海裏投下假象的原子彈，有時候我們派一架飛機到日本去投下一顆炸彈，試騐投彈的準確性。</p>
<p>到八月十五日中午，一切準備都已就緒了。原子彈預備好了，飛機亦加足了油，機伴都試過了。起飛的時間定在半夜兩點三十分。</p>
<p>我想瞌睡一會，但沒法能睡。一點鐘，我們吃了火腿和雞蛋。一點三十分，有三架飛機起飛到日本去探察目標上空的氣候情形。</p>
<p>原子彈放進了我的坐機。我的副駕駛是鮑勃路易，領航馮凱克，投彈手菲里比。兩架B29和我們同行。一架測騐爆炸的風力，一架攝影。兩點一刻，我們開動了發動機。我忘記了原子彈，只集中注意在儀器的檢查上。</p>
<p>鮑勃路易計算着時間。還有十五秒鐘，十秒，五秒，準備——</p>
<p>兩點三十分正，飛機離開地向日本飛去了，展開了這原子彈的新時代。</p>
<p>爬到相當高度，我喝了點咖啡，回過頭來向同伴們說了炸彈艙裏的事怎麼一個傢伙。他們聽着，了解了，仍保持着鎮靜，一顆原子彈，好。</p>
<p>八點十五分，我們在無線電中收到了巡邏機的天氣報告：廣島上空能見度十哩，微有雲霧。我們繼續爬高，三架B29結成了一個鬆鬆的隊形。</p>
<p>距廣島二十五哩，我們開始用雷達來控制飛機。高度計上正指着三一·六〇〇呎，我們將依照預訂的計劃，在九點十五分投下炸彈。</p>
<p>離目標十二哩，菲里比喊起來說：「我望見了！」</p>
<p>他抓緊住投彈孔，把駕駛桿從我手中接了過去。無線電中發出極響的警告，通知保護我們的B29，兩分鐘內就要投彈了。菲里比向我點了點頭，一切都很好。他向無線電員做了一個手勢，無線電中一種連續不斷的聲音發出了，告訴各機，「十五秒鐘後投彈。」</p>
<p>無線電的聲音停了，投彈下了。菲里比離開了投彈孔。我丟下自動操縱桿，把飛機急劇轉彎。</p>
<p>我把護月鏡拉上。突然間什麽都看不見，我完全盲了。我把眼鏡丟在地上。</p>
<p>一陣耀眼的亮光充滿了機內，第一次急劇的氣浪打中了我們。我們已離開爆炸地十一英哩半了，但整個飛機在劇烈地搖擺着，我發了一聲喊，以爲飛機已被高射砲火打中了。</p>
<p>後艙的機槍手曾看見第一氣浪襲來了，但他不知道這是什麽東西。到第二次氣浪又來時，他發出了警告。</p>
<p>我們回頭俯視廣島。全城一片烟火，火柱上昇到難於置信的高度。這照片現在大家都曾看到過了。</p>
<p>大家沉默一會，然後每個人都在談論着了，我記得略易搖擺我的臂膀，說：「看呀！看呀！」他說他舌頭上可以嚐到原子彈爆炸發出來的滋味，是和鉛的滋味一樣的。</p>
<p>菲里比在歸途上發了一個報告，「結果極佳。」</p>
<p>「喂，你說如何？」他問我說：「的確是好極了。」</p>
<p>當我們着陸時，聽見有一個人喊，「立正！」斯巴茲將軍走上前來，把一顆DSC勁章掛在我的襟上。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>一位親戚吿訴我，他最近想搭乘一路電車，竟無異於守株待兎。一次是六月二十三日，有風，下午九點至九點五十分，在南京路浙江路站上等候東行的一路電車，目送了若干輛二路車開過，未見一輛一路電車。一次是本月十三日下午四點五十五分至五點二十五分，在同一站上等同一路車，東行的二路車達二十四輛，未見一輛一路車，就是西行的電車，二路的也不下二十輛，而一路的共計只開過了二輛。又一次，看到一件有趣的事實，本月十四日下午十時，他經過四川北路回寓，自長春路口以南至復興中路門前那個終點站上，計停有北行的一路電車七輛之多。</p>
<p>我們相信，電車也是一種公用事業，目的是在便利一般不能自備包車三輪車以至汽車的小民。照上而的事實看，從靜安寺至四川北路底的一路電車可實在有點令乘客傷腦筋。</p>
<p>自然，我們是不敢相信電車公司故意苛待這全市乘客最擠的一條路綫的。可是第一，若說六月廿三日夜間有風，二路都在照樣行駛；第二，若說車輛不够分配，至於半小時或五十分鐘沒有一輛一路車開出，則二路車怎應該在半小時中開出了二十車輛？第三，終點站同時停歇車輛達七輛之多，不知起點站是否有同樣情形，豈因二路車的終點站在衆目昭彰的外難遂不敢有比種連停七車之怪現象乎？</p>
<p>說起來，又是件小事，但小民的時間同樣也是時間，謹以此文陳諸公用事業當局。</p>
<h3 id="c160">用國貨最光榮 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>當舶來品　塞得滿坑滿谷的時候，我們的工業界爲了它脆弱的生命的基礎，不能不發出呼救的聲音了每一個人，對於我們工業界目前遭遇的不幸的命運，不能不寄深切的同情。</p>
<p>多用一件國貨，就是多替我們自己留一分元氣。</p>
<p>即使你穿上了玻璃衣服，一切的東西都成了玻璃化，你也依然不能把你自己提高一分身價和地位。專門拖着人家的尾巴，這邊用原子什麼，那邊用Pol型什麼，充其量，也只是一個應聲蟲而已。</p>
<p>大家用中國貨，才能使中國工桀界渡過難關，走進光明的大道。</p>
<p>許許多多的外國貨都走私逃過我們的海關。但是我們的工業界除了應付高價的原料人工，還得負擔政府巨額的稅款。這精神，就修多麼可佩。</p>
<p>愛用國貨決不是排外。相反的我們極希望外國貨的輸入，不過我們所希望輸入的是機器原料，好讓我們的工業也一天天的發達。</p>
<p>固然，外國貨比國貨便宜，但是，節儉，就能帮助你解決這個問題。</p>
<p>不要因爲小而忽略，大家衆志成城，那末，也許要每一個人省下了少買一匣鞋油，彙起來足够開一個鞋油廠。</p>
<p>今天，外國已經是原子時代了，我們還遠落在後面。但是，光是追在人家的後面，吃的是外國防粉，外國罐頭，外國橘子，穿的是外國衣料，外國西裝，用的是外國化妝品，這依然是極大的恥辱。假使大家用自己的出品，雖是粗劣，却總還是値得光榮和尊敬。</p>
<p>我們是戰勝國，巨大的犧牲換來了這光榮。但是一年來的教訓，可以每個人警惕自己，否則，這光榮能够再保存多少時候，也實在是一個火疑問。</p>
<p>大家每一個人平心靜氣地想一想，用國貨呢用外國貨？</p>
<p>用國貨，最光榮！</p>
<h3 id="c161">談糊塗 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 話客</p>
<p>「不痴不雙。不作阿家翁。」有一些人，有一些事，是以糊塗爲上策的。「難得糊塗」，「糊塗」是多麼可貴呵。</p>
<p>把萬事放得開一點，多帶一些「漢不關心」的冷淡氣氛，古往今來，許多人便常常贊嘆糊塗者是「君子之風」有「宰相之腹」。</p>
<p>本米，社會上多少幸運兒都是八面玲瓏，長袖善舞，圓而又圓的人物。軟得揑不出骨顯來，膝蓋的關節尤其靈活，能屈能伸十分柔軟。人太軟了，雖然可以閱歷老成，可以鋒茫不露，但畢竟缺少了一點骨氣，缺少一點凜然不可侵犯的精神，因循苟且，就慢慢的「糊塗」起來了。</p>
<p>在中國，「大事不糊塗」彷彿也是一種高明的美德。但是實際上就是小事不妨糊塗點。於是外國科學家窮畢生之力去計算，我們的統計只表示一個大概情形。其實人家已竭盡全力地在研究分子，原子，電子，……難道我們的天地還可能是「渾沌未開」的天地嗎。</p>
<p>而實際上，大事也並非一定不糊塗的，因爲在「大事化小事，小事化無事。」的作風之下，天大的事也可以平平易易的過去，風平浪靜，換得一個「淸靜無爲」的結果。</p>
<p>「大智若愚，大巧若拙，」怪不得好多聰明人却在學糊塗，裝得「視而不見，聽而不聞」的樣子哩！</p>
<p>就這樣，有人稱「糊塗」便是聰明，便是好處，不過要懷疑的是：「尸居餘氣」的「人」，還是不是「人」？還是不是「萬物之靈」？</p>
<h3 id="c162">教授不要改行 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 馬超常</p>
<p>讀十四日報載，大學教授改行，開設跳舞學校一則，閱後油然生出了無限的思感。</p>
<p>現在知道廣州中山大學文學教授某氏，因了「糊口」，而放棄執教生涯，開設舞校，這種舉動是否正常，我現在姑且不論。但是連想到我們校中幾位教授，他們也在今年暑期起開始棄教而另就他業了，目的也是爲了維持生活，在這種情形之下，明見到各教授紛紛脫離他們的本位，而走向他途，這是社會之幸耶或社會之不幸。我以爲對靑年祇少是失去了一個理想的領導者，對國家祗少是失却了一位培養人才的人才。在現在建國過程當中，當然人才是第一，無人才也無從建國，旣然知道人才重要，那末豈可任憑培養人才之人才脫離本位。我看見現在各大學中的教授已感缺乏了，尤其是名教授更其寥寥。在這種情形之下，若再不設策保留各教授之職位，那末將來中國之大學教育，將不堪設想了。</p>
<p>記得上學期大學教授罷教，而現在看到大學教授改行，「罷教」是他們掙扎生活的積極辦法，而「改行」是他們改善生活的消極辦法。但是我們應當知道積極之可補，而消極之不足恃，所以我們不能隨便忽略了大學教授之改行，同時我敢說，現在大學教授之改行，正是代表着中國教育危機將臨之先聲。</p>
<h3 id="c163">自由港 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 玉麟</p>
<p>香港當局已佈吿自七月一日起禁止布疋綢緞及呢絨進口了。常然這措置含有非常的意義，絕對不是爲了挽救當地廠商出品的銷路，事實上這個禁令是爲了依照現在情形，香港的英國貨恐不堪受美國國貨的競爭。香港目前仍在英國統治之下，當局爲了維護英國貨物在香港市塲固有的地位，所以下了這一個限制進口令，自由港從此不自由了。</p>
<p>美國的綢緞布疋呢絨以及日用百貨目前正源源向世界各國都市中傾銷，使各國工商界都感到威脅。我國因爲現在物資缺乏，似乎需要外國貨來接濟，這種救急是需要的，如果長時期要依靠外國貨來維持本國的市塲，那當然又是不智的。像香港地方目前物資也不見得比上海充足，然而英國當局爲了本身的利益，就首先下了禁止綢緞布疋呢絨的進口令，我想這個禁令以後可能影影到其他的進口貨物。</p>
<p>現在滬上各國貨廠商對美貨的傾銷，已經感到嚴重的威脅。如果大家再不想辦法來挽救，那麼國貨的前途將不堪設想。然而我們的國家在國事紛擾中，對於政治與軍事已感到難以解決，那麼對於經濟上的困難一時更難覓得解決的路徑了。我們能做到的怕還是愛用國貨罷。</p>

<p>— 乾子</p>
<p>我繞着市政府走了一圈，覺得這幢房子，建築得眞够堅固。這個堅固，似乎已超越了居住的堅固的限度。一個有些軍事常識的人說：這座房子，祇要幾個門口堆上了沙袋，便是一個很好的堡壘；裏面有一片廣場，戰車可以出入，地又接近黃浦江，補給連絡都很便利。這幢房子，原是前英租界的工部局，可見當初英人用心是如此深長了。</p>
<h3 id="c165">在公園裏聽到的 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 小石</p>
<p>在顧家宅花園裏，聽到了下面這許多話：</p>
<p>「我是從前法國人主持這公園的時候，就在這裏做的，從前的工錢四十八元，可買五担米：現在是已七萬二千元，米一担都不容易買。」</p>
<p>「法國人對於公園的管理，非常認眞，而且有固定的預算，預算一經決定，絲毫沒有更改。預算項目下的錢，個個用在公園的管理上，所以公園辦得很好。我們在常時都很省力，成績又佳，可是目下的情形，完全不同，對於公園修管，毫無的款，縱然破坍不堪，需要一隻洋釘，也非做公事申誚不可，而且必須經過三四個審閱機關，時間長久得會使你忘記，可是結果往往還不易照辦。譬如三月份的公事，現在還不知究竟呢？」</p>
<p>「公園門票，照理不應出賣，世界各國及中國各埠都不買票，這裏買票的原因，乃在限制遊客？入園的人也可整齊些。這也是個變通的辦法，未始不可。不過票款所入，最好完全用在公園的事業本身。（現在是解繳財政局充作市府經常費。）而且園裏應興　革的事情實在太多，沒有錢是不能辦的。現在我們時常排頭，說我們弄得這樣不好，那樣不好。其實巧婦難煮無米餐，頂了石臼做戲，吃力不討好，說來眞是怨哉枉也。」</p>
<p>「有一個時期（敵僞時代），主持公園管理的人，非但對於公園絕無興革，反而張三李四，都叫我們把公園裏比較好一點的花卉樹木，以及坐椅搬到他們私人的住宅裏去，而且還常要二個三個小工去他們私人住宅內拔草做工。他們是上司，我們怎能不服從命令呢？」</p>
<p>「我們並不是媚外，強說法國人好，這是事實，我們總希望中國人自己管理後，成績要比他們好。」</p>
<p>凡是最近到過公園的人，都可證實上面一番話的言之非謬。誠然，坐椅比前缺少，進了公園，要找個坐椅正是爲難得很，而且有的坐椅早經破壞不堪，出奇的花草也不多見，也沒有新的佈置，小工三十多名，僅僅做些鋤草掃地工作而已</p>

<p>— 雲侃</p>
<p>王某以「收不義之財」罪名，被捉到縣長面前審問！</p>
<p>縣長問他：「你有沒收過「正當」的錢財？」</p>
<p>王某回答說：「有，只有一次，就是舊年選舉大人做參議員時，大人賞給的五千元和一條毛巾一塊肥皂」。</p>
<p>林先生對他一位鄰居說：「聽說你兒子從海外回來了！」</p>
<p>那位鄰居却說：</p>

<h3 id="c167">不要發橫財 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>九日的報紙上，用顯著的地位載有一則新聞：「窮教員發橫財冒領公款二萬萬」。閱後我很驚奇，憐惜，最後當然是作了一個深長的嘆息。想不到吃筆墨飯的人，也會做出這勾當，眞是「物價高漲，人格低落」。</p>
<p>然而想來想去，覺得這件事並不單純，僅這個私人犯法的行爲，附帶着社會中一個嚴重的問題。一位窮教員，收入有限，養不起一家的老小。於是，他就會想出許許多多「發橫財」的念頭，我想一個將事業寄托在教育身上的人，本來多半是熱心服務於人羣的。假使他的生活能過得去，他一定會安份守己，而不會使社會上發生種稱不幸的事。</p>
<p>抗戰中是「軍事第一」，而戰後建國大業中，「教育是第一。」因此我希望政府當局社會賢達多多注視與改善教員生活的待遇。僅憑着一次兩次尊師運動的募捐的補救還不够。那不是一種根本的辦法。</p>
<p>但我又將話題講回來，人儘管是「窮」要「窮」得有志氣。而且，文人太半「窮」，但文人是「先知先覺」，理智與見解比一般人要高。因此，他們不該是軟骨頭，而且我相信太多數都不是。什麼財不想發·偏偏要過着日日子，這也是文人優良傳統的氣魄。這種氣魄還是存在的。</p>
<p>而今，我看到了這條消息以後，不禁使我們遺憾，文人中出了如此敗類。我們要知道，「錢」雖然人人都愛，可是都不能冒險發橫財，因為這樣可以「一失足成千古恨」，再也洗不淸自己的汚點，遺害終身，不但吃官司，而且連事業與前途也付之東流。在這裏我忠誠的勸吿。每一個人，千萬「不要發橫財！」</p>

<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>自從你撒手長逝之後，這一個字，好似變做了一個沒有靈魂的家，我也好似變做了一個沒有靈魂的人，整日的像行屍走肉一般，獨個兒在園子裏徘徊着，獨個兒追想過去的種種，得到一些甜蜜的回味。記得卅年前的農曆正月蕙八日，是我們倆結婚的佳期，就給我打開了幸福之門，從此成家立業，完全得力於你的　助。在結婚之前，我本已有了對象，可是爲了她幼年早已字人，好事不諧，雙方又都是怯懦的孩子，屈服於舊禮教的魔掌之下，不敢妄動；雖已通信三年，却從沒有會過一次面，談過一句話，到得她委曲地被迫投入了別人的懷抱，我苦痛得甚麼似的。一年以後，母親見我太可憐了，勸我別締良緣，我就想起了曾在崁兄家裏時常撞見的你來；經表兄他們委託鄰居來向你家說親·立時得到了你父親的金諾，竟把單生的愛女配給了我，因爲那時「禮拜六」周刋正在風行，他老人家已知道我的名字了。在你過門之後的第三天，我就毫不隱瞞的把那重情天公案吿知了你，幷且把伊人的照片也給你瞧了；你雖然有些兒不高興，却也力自容忍，只對我說：「來日方畏，只要你對得起我就是了」，卅年來，我雖仍作繭自縛，忘不了伊人，可是敬你愛你，始終如一，這是你所不容否認的吧？以後的若干年間，我們爲了這回事，有時雖免不了略有口舌之爭，終因　忍相諒，隨發隨收，無損於我們根深蒂固的情感。記得我的詩稿中，曾有這麼兩首詩：「情絲着體年方少，聽劍難揮萬　紛；我有雙心分兩室，渠儂占一一歸君」。「佯　薄怒尋常見，冷語微詞幾度陳；往事縈心君且諒，雙方本是共衾人」。我把詩意說給你聽，你也不以爲忤，只說我是個痴子罷了。是啊！我是一個情塲中的痴子，痴於你，痴於伊人，並行不悖的直到如今。</p>
<p>婚後一年，你就給我生下了錚兒，不幸遭遇難產，幾乎被穩婆誤了事，忙再改請產科女醫師施用手術接生，總算大小平安的產下來了，可是那助手手忙脚亂，把古羅方蒙藥灑了你一嘴臉，童致發腫潰爛，過了一個多月方始恢復原狀。在你呻吟轉側之際，我眼見你捱受着莫大的痛苦，竟急得暈厥了過去。你產後不到十天，就起牀料理家務，一面又将自己哺乳，辛苦已極，可是限於經濟，不得不偏勞了你；記得後來我又有三首「調　人」的詩，就是爲此而發的的「常君十七妙年時，髮約紅絲粉薄施；生到唇家来作婦·峨眉不掃掃階墀·」「當年膽小怯空房，此日居然作阿娘；」自藍田生玉後，檀奴不愛愛兒郎。」「家常瑣屑自料量，井臼親操盡日忙；且俟金婚花燭夜，何妨讓汝作新郎？」你聽到末一首，不由得笑了起來，說：虧你想得出來的；要我作新郎，還得重投一個胎啊！」</p>
<p>前後十七年，你一共給我生下了三男四女七個孩子，本來是我和母親倆一個凄淸寂寞的家庭，仗着你的力量，就變得人丁興旺，成了一個像模像樣的家庭了。幸而我的經濟情形逐漸改善，所以除了第二個出生的女兒玲仍由你自己哺乳外，其他五個都僱了乳媽，雖說分了你一部分的勞，但你仍然忙得很，雖有母親和葉媽王媽等可以帮忙，然而你事無鉅細，都要過問；一面還得分出時間來伺候我，吃的穿的，樣樣留心；我的收入雖已增多，而你仍不肯浪費分文，你這種克勤克儉刻苦耐勞的精神，實在是偉大的。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Our Newspaper, 16th] It is widely rumored here that Special Envoy Marshall will arrive the day after tomorrow. Whether or not the KMT-CPC negotiations will move to Lushan to continue will be decided after General Ma arrives. It is also learned that General Ma had a handwritten letter delivered by Mrs. Marshall to Chairman Chiang yesterday afternoon. Furthermore, it is learned that Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng of the Ministry of National Defense is coming soon. Chen's residence at No. 106 Hedong Road in Kuling has been prepared.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] Minister of Transportation Yu Da-wei visited Special Envoy Marshall at General Ma's residence on Ninghai Road at 10:00 this morning for a four-hour discussion. The reporter interviewed Minister Yu at 5:00 PM to inquire about the content of today's conversation. Minister Yu only replied: "Very ordinary, very ordinary!" The reporter then inquired that since the negotiations have been cold for a long time, there must be a topic for the Minister's visit today. Minister Yu initially laughed and said that the reporter was too sensitive, and then said: "I often meet with General Ma." The reporter finally asked about the definite date of the Minister's trip to Lushan. Minister Yu replied humorously: I am a soldier and my life is militarized. If I am summoned to Lushan, I don't need to pack my luggage.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai returned from Shanghai at 3:00 PM today and visited General Ma at 6:00 PM tonight, returning at 8:00 PM. It is heard that the topic of conversation was "The War in Northern Jiangsu". Some say that the issue of moving the negotiation location to Kuling may have been mentioned, but the CCP stated that it has not yet made such a plan, but also believes that the negotiations will definitely not be terminated.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] The political atmosphere in the capital was once diluted by the heat wave, but since yesterday, it has partially tended to be tense again due to the serious news of the war in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Stuart Leighton, studied maps with Special Envoy Marshall at General Ma's residence this morning. It is also heard that he requested more detailed maps from the Ministry of National Defense for reference. At 12:00 noon, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Director Li Jun, to visit our Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, making his first courtesy call since arriving in Beijing yesterday. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes before he left. It is learned that Stuart plans to visit Chairman Chiang in Lushan on Friday to present his credentials. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently preparing for this.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] The capital is extremely hot. Government officials such as Soong Tzu-wen, Sun Fo, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Wang Shijie, Bai Chongxi, Zhu Jiahua, and Wu Tiecheng will all go to Kuling. The US military authorities are preparing for Special Envoy Marshall to go to Kuling at the weekend. Three planes have already been used to transport wireless equipment to Jiujiang Airport. Jiujiang Airport is currently building a radio station for planes flying from Nanjing to Jiujiang. In addition, this will allow the General Ma's residence in Nanjing to maintain close contact with Kuling. A group of foreign reporters flew to Kuling this morning.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Our Newspaper, 16th] After Chairman Chiang arrived in Kuling a few days ago, he gained a moment of leisure. However, he is accustomed to worrying about national affairs. After listening to reports on important matters related to the military and political affairs of the National Government, he immediately issued written replies and instructions as usual. He worked all day yesterday and received several senior generals who came to Lushan to attend the demobilization conference of the Youth Army, and inquired about matters.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Our Newspaper, 16th] Chairman Chiang and his wife, and Mrs. Marshall, took their first mountain tour after arriving in Lushan at 6:15 PM today. They visited the Huanglin Temple presided over by Master Taixu and the Immortal Cave for about two hours, and did not return until dusk. The Chairman was still wearing a long blue gown and a black mandarin jacket, with a ruddy complexion and excellent spirit. When the sedan chair carrying the Chairman and others passed the entrance of the Lushan Administration Bureau, the Chairman smiled and nodded in reply to the special correspondent of this newspaper. Mrs. Chiang smiled shyly when she went out for the first time and met the reporter. The citizens of Kuling also showed joy when they saw the Chairman and his wife traveling, and their love and support were unanimous.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, Our Newspaper, 16th] After Mrs. Marshall arrived in Kuling yesterday, she was introduced to the Chairman by Mrs. Chiang. At 10:30 this morning, Mrs. Marshall and her adjutant took a walk on Hedong Street. The reporter of this newspaper met Mrs. Marshall in an antique shop. According to her, the quiet and beautiful scenery of Lushan and the neat and clean streets are rarely comparable to European cities. When the reporter asked when General Ma would go up the mountain, Mrs. Marshall replied: He will come in a few days. She also said that when General Ma comes to Kuling, they will visit various scenic spots together.</p>

<p>[Special Exclusive Dispatch from Kuling, Our Newspaper, 16th, 1:00 PM] Lushan, a popular summer resort, has once again become the political center of our country in the summer. For thousands of years, people have been using sedan chairs or walking to go up and down Kuling, which is extremely inconvenient. It is learned that the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers has been entrusted with designing and building a mountain climbing cable car. The estimated cost is US$30,000. After the Jiangxi Provincial Government approves it, construction can begin. The project is scheduled to be completed within 15 months. However, if progress is rapid, the first train is expected to be opened when Chairman Chiang climbs the mountain next year.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the situation in northern Jiangsu, which has long been watched and cared for by all parties, has gradually moved from a dim and dull atmosphere to a bright and developing path. Since the Communist army in northern Jiangsu violated the government's ceasefire order and launched a large-scale offensive, the National Army has adopted a defensive posture in accordance with the ceasefire order, resulting in the danger of being defeated one by one in recent weeks. On the 13th of this month, Guangfu Bridge, the intersection of the Yangtai Highway, was cut off first. On the 15th, Taixian County and ports were greatly threatened. For a time, people were panicked and the situation was extremely serious. In order to boost morale and implement self-defense plans, the National Army stationed in Yangtai has now begun to attack. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the main force of the Communist army has been defeated, and Xuanjiabao has been captured in one fell swoop, and the Communist army has been completely cleared. The Communist army in Taixing is now fleeing to the southeast, and the National Army is expanding its victory and pursuing the attack. The Communist army of about 15,000 people in Zhangtaozhen, southeast of Taixian County, also attacked, but was repelled by the National Army. The situation in the ports is still stable, and the Kou Tai (Zhou) Highway is unimpeded. The Yangtai Highway has also been repaired by the National Army. It is reported that another National Army has detoured to force its way into Shaobo. The people in Yangzhou and Tai were extremely excited after hearing the news. The Jiangdu Daily and Jiangsu Provincial Daily specially issued extra editions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] More than 20,000 Communist troops moved from Lingtang Bridge to Tianchang on the morning of the 16th, with unclear intentions. In addition, more than two miles of the road from Chahe to Guangmu Bridge in Yiling Northeast were destroyed by the Communist army on the 15th, and the bridge was also demolished. The Communist army in Dingjiahu, north of Xiannv Temple, continuously attacked our stationed troops, seemingly as a probing nature.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] Military News: Li Yimang, Chairman of the CCP's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government, recently decided on a new strategy: (1) Military operations will be defensive, only ordering militia to act as the front line to avoid sacrificing elite troops; (2) Abandon certain strongholds when necessary and implement a scorched earth policy.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Our Newspaper, 16th] According to a telephone call from Taixian County, the Communist army, with a crowd of 50,000, fiercely attacked Taixing for three days and nights. After the National Army's Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu led his troops to resist fiercely, killing more than 20,000 enemies, the Communist army finally failed and withdrew to Huangqiao at 5:00 AM on the 16th. There are no traces of the enemy in the suburbs of Taixing, and the National Army is following up and pursuing the attack.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 16th] The increasingly serious conflicts in northern Jiangsu are highly valued by people here.

Their usual external propaganda, that the National Army is attacking northern Jiangsu, has now been defeated without being attacked."</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Communist Army Launches a General Offensive in Northern Jiangsu; The Government Protests <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Communist army launched a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu, causing extreme anxiety among the people in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The reporter specially visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense on this matter and asked about the situation and opinions. According to reports, at a time when peace negotiations are facing a serious stage, the Communist army suddenly mobilized 16 regiments of troops to launch a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu, apparently wanting to disregard everything, seize the cities and towns on the north bank of the Yangtze River in one fell swoop, control the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, threaten Beijing and Shanghai, and create a favorable position relying on violence. Cities and towns such as Taixing, Xuanjiabao, and Zhangdian were captured by the Communist army on the 15th, and Haimen and Taixian County were besieged at the same time. A group of people attacked Shili Dian, north of Liuhe, while Yangzhou, Jiangyin Nantong, and Lai'an Jiashan in Anhui Province were all in urgent need of help. Xuzhou and Shandong were also in a state of emergency. Liuhe is only more than 30 kilometers away from the capital, Haimen is only 50 kilometers away from Shanghai, and Taixing is only 140 kilometers away from the capital. If these cities are lost, Beijing and Shanghai will be shaken, and Jiangnan will be in danger. This planned offensive by the Communist army completely violates the January 10th Agreement on the Cessation of Conflict this year. The spokesperson also said that northern Jiangsu is only across the river from the capital and Shanghai. From the effective date of the January 13th Cessation of Conflict Order to the end of July, the Communist army launched as many as five attacks on Liuhe, Yangzhou, Nantong, and Haimen. The attacks on the National Army in other places have never stopped. This time, the Communist Party has mobilized a large force to launch a full-scale general offensive in northern Jiangsu. The government has now lodged a serious protest with the Military Three-Person Group, Marshall, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Good Autumn Harvests Expected in Various Places; Grain Prices Generally Decline; Spokesperson for the Ministry of Food Speaks <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] According to a statement from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Food: The price of grain throughout the country fluctuated in some areas due to the period between the end of the spring harvest and the beginning of the autumn harvest. Recently, due to the even rainfall in various places and the expectation of a good autumn harvest, there is a general trend of fatigue. According to recent observations of grain prices in major cities, rice prices in the southern provinces and the Beijing-Shanghai area are gradually smooth, with supply and demand corresponding. The price of medium-ripe rice in the market is still around 43,000 to 44,000 yuan per shi. However, in Shanghai, the price of rice once rose sharply due to the scarcity of sources and the imbalance between supply and demand. Later, due to the large number of Vietnamese rice and Sichuan-Jiangxi rice being transported in continuously, it was sold to citizens at a price of 46,000 yuan per shi, and the rising trend has slowed down. The two provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian are about to harvest drought rice, and the price of rice is expected to fall, mostly between 30,000 and 50,000. The provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei have also gradually declined recently. The decline in Sichuan Province is even more severe. The price of cooked rice in Chongqing has fallen to 12,000 yuan, and the price of cooked rice in Neijiang has fallen below 10,000 yuan. The price of rice in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces is still between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan, which is quite stable. As for the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, the grain prices rose the highest due to the serious disaster situation in the past. Recently, the autumn rice is growing well and the early rice is gradually being harvested. The prices have been falling steadily. For example, Guangzhou and Guilin have fallen from a high price of 100,000 to 62,000 and 85,000 respectively. The decline in Changsha is even greater, now selling for 47,000 yuan. Soon, the new grain will be available, and the price of rice in various provinces is expected to fall generally. As for the price of wheat in the northern provinces, it is also generally tired and stable due to the good wheat harvest, especially in the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, which are even cheaper. Except for Xi'an and Lanzhou, which are slightly higher at 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, most of the others are between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan. The price of wheat in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces is slightly higher. For example, in Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, and Taiyuan, it has fallen to around 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] A UNRRA spokesperson said: The quantity of various supplies continuing to be delivered to China has not decreased. It is believed that after receiving a report from Shanghai soon, the order to suspend the shipment of all materials to China except for emergency relief grain can be relaxed to some extent. According to unofficial sources in the State Department, the suspension of shipments to China will be short-term. According to reliable sources, UNRRA Acting Director-General Rooks has notified the US representative of the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) that he believes China's request to restore the supply of medicines and transportation rehabilitation equipment can be accepted, but the order can only be issued after receiving news from UNRRA officials in Shanghai that the goods to be shipped have been cleared. The UNRRA spokesperson believes that the suspension order may need to be gradually modified rather than completely canceled at once. The current policy is to cancel the ban on a certain item as soon as a report is received from Shanghai that there is a satisfactory environment for that particular type of item to be shipped to the interior, but no report on any such item has been received so far. There may be a report received today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] The US Senate discussed the final appropriation of $465 million for UNRRA today, and there was a fierce debate about La Guardia's suspension of supplies to China and other criticisms. The Senate Appropriations Committee today scrutinized Assistant Secretary of State Clayton and La Guardia in a closed-door meeting, criticizing UNRRA for not paying attention to distribution. Senator Stire protested that the United States was bowing to the Soviet Union on the issue of spending relief funds and predicted that the international community would slander the United States. Senator Bridges said: "Clayton and others have created the fact that UNRRA has canceled relief supplies to China, but continues to supply countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia. To our knowledge, all of the aforementioned countries have misused relief supplies." Mr. Clayton said: "UNRRA's suspension of relief supplies to China is purely because China cannot provide the tools for unloading supplies or the transportation equipment for transporting supplies to the interior." The Appropriations Committee finally passed the $465 million UNRRA appropriation.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Editorial: The Vatican Sends an Envoy to China <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Vatican has dispatched an envoy (Internuncio) to China, nominating Archbishop Antonio Riberi as the first Vatican envoy to China. This has been agreed upon by our government and announced successively in Rome and Nanjing. Although there is no confirmed information on when Envoy Riberi will arrive in China, now that the news has been released, the establishment of the Vatican Embassy in China should not be far off. Following the appointment of the first Cardinal of Chinese nationality and the establishment of the Catholic Church system in China, the Vatican's dispatch of an envoy to China is an unprecedented event in church history. Moreover, for our country, having a Vatican envoy stationed in the capital is also an unprecedented event in our diplomatic history.</p>
<p>Our country's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican coincided with the emergency in the international situation following the outbreak of the Pacific War. At that time, Japan dispatched Ken Harada, a counselor at its embassy in France, as its first envoy to the Vatican, who was later promoted to ambassador. For a time, the Vatican became the center of international diplomacy. The Axis powers such as Germany, Italy, and Japan had envoys stationed there, while the Allied powers such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Latin American countries also had envoys stationed at the Vatican. In order to take the diplomatic initiative and counter Japan's measures, our country began negotiations with the Vatican in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942) to establish diplomatic relations. An agreement was reached that our country would dispatch an envoy to the Vatican, while the Vatican would continue to have its Apostolic Delegate originally stationed in China perform his duties. Based on this resolution, our government appointed Xie Shoukang, the Chargé d'Affaires originally stationed in Switzerland, as our country's first envoy to the Vatican. The Apostolic Delegate to China considered that the center of Catholicism in China was in North China, which was occupied territory and faced greater difficulties, and disregarding the Japanese invaders' brutality and his personal safety, he continued to reside in Peiping (Beijing) to plan church affairs. In order to maintain contact with our government, Bishop Yu Weishan of Chongqing was appointed as Deputy Delegate, and an office of the Apostolic Delegation was established in the wartime capital. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Archbishop Cai Ning, the Apostolic Delegate to China, flew from Peiping to Chongqing to meet with the Chairman and the heads of our government. He reported on the years of struggle against the Japanese invaders to protect the church's work, and then flew to Shanghai, Hankou, Hong Kong, and other places to convene episcopal conferences, listen to reports, and plan for the future development of church affairs.</p>
<p>Some people, noting that our country had sent an envoy to the Vatican, while the Vatican's envoy in China was an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status, believed that our country's diplomatic relations with the Vatican were a one-way street. Thus, they advocated requiring the government to order our envoy to the Vatican to negotiate with the Vatican to send an envoy to China as soon as possible to replace the existing Apostolic Delegate. The Vatican's maintenance of relations with various countries and dispatch of envoys was originally carefully considered. The United Kingdom has a state religion and sends an envoy to the Vatican, but the Vatican sends an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status to the United Kingdom. US President Truman sent a personal representative with ambassadorial status to the Vatican, but the Vatican sent an Apostolic Delegate without diplomatic status to the United States. The dispatch of a Vatican envoy currently only exists for the Netherlands. Otherwise, the Vatican either sends an Ambassador (Noncio) or an Apostolic Delegate. Now that our government has agreed to the dispatch of a Vatican envoy, in addition to the Netherlands, there is one more Vatican envoy among the envoys dispatched by the Vatican.</p>
<p>A month ago, Cardinal Tien Gengsin returned from Rome and, passing through Shanghai, said that Pope Pius XII intended to send an ambassador to China to promote relations between China and the Vatican. Our Chairman has always attached great importance to the relationship between our country and the Vatican and also intended to upgrade our country's envoy to the Vatican to an ambassador. However, this plan has not been realized at this time. Some people believe that, according to international practice, a Vatican ambassador should be the leader of the diplomatic corps in the host country, which may be inconvenient in our country's situation. However, they do not know that it is precisely because our country's situation is different from purely Catholic countries such as France, Italy, and Latin American countries, and also different from the United Kingdom and the United States, that if a Vatican ambassador were stationed in our country and served as the leader of the diplomatic corps, it would be enough to show the broadness of our national spirit and set an example for the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. Moreover, the Vatican has no political ambitions, and having the Vatican ambassador serve as the leader of the diplomatic corps would be sufficient to show its transcendent status. Furthermore, since our country established a church system, our country has had a normal church organization and is no longer a missionary area. It is especially appropriate to respect its system and exchange ambassadors. According to international practice, an envoy represents the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but only an ambassador can represent the head of state.</p>
<p>The Vatican is a small place, without a single soldier. From a materialistic point of view, its position in international relations is insignificant. However, the Vatican, because it is the residence of the Pope and the repository of the world's highest moral authority, is important. The post-war reconstruction of the world, with its myriad threads, requires the reconstruction of the moral order as the top priority. For this reason, envoys from various countries gather at the Vatican, making it an important center of international diplomacy. Our country, as a country without a state religion, sends an ambassador to be stationed there, which is sufficient to show our emphasis on moral authority and promote the glorious traditions left by our ancestors. Now that our country has established normal diplomatic relations with the Vatican and exchanged envoys, we deeply hope that there will be further development in the near future, upgrading the envoy to an ambassador, to be in line with the utmost intention of our Chairman and the Pope to promote relations between our country and the Vatican.</p>
<p>Now that the Vatican envoy has been announced and will soon come to China to take office, the Apostolic Delegation to China, established since the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), will be abolished. Archbishop Cai Ning, the current Apostolic Delegate to China, who has been in China for 13 years, will soon return home. Since the establishment of the Apostolic Delegation to China, it has been more than 20 years. Through the efforts of Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning, the relationship between the Catholic Church in China and our country and the Vatican has finally reached its current state. As we recall their meritorious service, we express our sincere gratitude and admiration to both Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning. The new Vatican envoy to China, Archbishop Antonio Riberi, is knowledgeable, talented, and capable. We firmly believe that he will be able to build on the achievements of Archbishops Costantini and Cai Ning and make many contributions to promoting relations between our country and the Vatican. We only express our welcome here.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The Yorkshire Post, commenting on Eden's recent speech in London emphasizing the need to strengthen Sino-British relations, said: This is merely a public statement of the belief that all thoughtful people have long held. During the war, many Chinese were hurt because the British paid little attention to China. It continued: Today, China is beset by civil war and has not yet presented a pleasing picture. It also stated: "It is noteworthy that people who have personally experienced such disasters have not lost faith in China's future." In some parts of China, where there is no communist disturbance, construction work is progressing step by step, especially the restoration of railway transportation. The newspaper added: "If only the Yangtze River basin and South China can restore peace and prosperity, the impact on the world's recovery will be inestimable." The newspaper solemnly declared: If we want to win the respect of the Chinese, we must promote not only trade, but also cultural relations and understanding.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Byrnes Accuses Soviet Policy of Hindering Germany's Economic Recovery; Peace Should Not Be Based on Revenge; The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting Achieves Little <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Secretary of State Byrnes gave a radio broadcast today reporting on the proceedings of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Paris. Byrnes blamed the Soviet Union for the lack of progress on the German and Austrian issues at the meeting, but also acknowledged that the prospects for negotiations on the peace treaties for the five defeated European nations were now clearer, as the foreign ministers' efforts to reach an agreement had borne fruit and the European Peace Conference would be convened in Paris on the 29th of this month. Byrnes said that the peace treaties agreed upon at the meeting were not the ultimate in human wisdom, but were indeed the greatest wisdom that mankind could achieve under the four principles recognized by the United Nations. Ninety days after the ratification of these treaties, the occupying forces must withdraw, leaving only a portion of the troops to protect the lines of communication. At that time, the people of the occupied countries will be able to live and breathe in an atmosphere of freedom, and we will embark on the road to restoring peace. Regarding the issues of Germany and Austria, I believe that the Soviet Union finds it difficult to understand us, just as we find it difficult to understand the Soviet Union. The US proposal for Germany's disarmament, which was supported by the UK and France, was opposed solely by the Soviet Union and was therefore shelved, which is truly regrettable. I believe that the four-power administration of Germany has not been entirely successful. Therefore, the US military representative will be instructed this week to cooperate with the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, or any one of them, on important administrative issues such as finance, transportation, communications, trade, and industry. If we do not achieve economic cooperation between the occupied zones, we will be responsible for violating the Potsdam Agreement. As for the Austrian issue, the Soviet Union insists that the refugee problem within the country and the elimination of the National Socialist Party's influence must be resolved before a peace treaty can be concluded with the country, which is also inappropriate. In short, we do not believe that peace should be based on revenge, but on righteousness, selflessness, and magnanimity. If we act with kindness and compassion, we can turn enemies into friends. We must trust in peace and pray for God's mercy to grant peace to the world.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Averell Harriman, in his recent book "The Realities of American Foreign Policy", criticized the Soviet Union. The gist is that the only totalitarian imperialism that threatens the world today is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is to establish a communist dictatorship system around the world. If the United States does not take immediate steps to stop its growth, it must succumb to it. We are seen by the world as a giant with feet of clay, and the people who look to us for leadership have begun to doubt whether we are intelligent enough to plan the work of freedom and peace. But the fact is that the United States possesses the overwhelming power to promote world peace. We must first oppose the idea of attacking the Soviet Union. We are stronger than the Soviet Union today because we rely on the atomic bomb and a large air force and can destroy it. But if we launch a pre-emptive war against the Soviet Union because we know that the Soviet government intends to wage war against us in the future, this action will lower our moral standards and make us indistinguishable from the communists. However, this does not mean that we should hesitate to use the atomic bomb to stop the new crimes of Soviet imperialism, because executing assassins is not an immoral act.</p>

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Pravda today published an article by Ichakov, stating that while the British side accuses the Soviet Union of lowering a "velvet curtain" in Eastern Europe, England itself is hanging a "velvet curtain" in the Pacific and the Middle East. This curtain isolates the East Indies from the outside world, and strange news often leaks from behind the curtain, indicating that it is difficult to cover the world's eyes and ears with one hand. The war ended a year ago, and the announcement has been made five months ago, yet the war in the East Indies continues day after day. Behind the same velvet curtain, the British delegation went to India with a plan to deal with the independence issue, but the most important issue, namely the withdrawal of British troops from India, was shelved.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Soviet Espionage Case; Canada Releases Investigation Report; Soviet Espionage Sub-Agencies Also Exist in the UK and US <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 16th] The Canadian official report on the Soviet espionage case stated: Soviet spies have carried samples of Uranium-235 to the Soviet Union. Many other highly secret military inventions have also been leaked as a result. Moscow is now seeking information on the post-war defense of the US, UK, and Canada. Soviet espionage work also has sub-agencies in the US and the UK, so Canada should consider whether to inform the "appropriate authorities in the UK and the US" of the matters it has uncovered.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Attorney General Clark announced last night that the US government has begun negotiations with the Canadian government on various points in the report. The Department of Justice is fully aware of the espionage situation and is prepared to take immediate action when necessary.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 15th] The Canadian Investigation Committee has released its third report on the Soviet espionage case. The final report, which is 200,000 words long, was released today. It stated: Soviet spies attempted to spy on the most important political secret information of the governments of the US, UK, and Canada within Canada. Moscow apparently has "several parallel secret agencies" in Canada, which may still be ongoing. The Soviet espionage network has also spread to the US and the UK, and even has traces in Europe. This report was submitted to the House of Commons by Prime Minister King. In addition to the original fourteen spies, nine more were identified, and several shocking secrets were revealed. The main points of the report are as follows: "There is an agency somewhere that specializes in obtaining counterfeit Canadian passports and other identification documents for espionage activities within Canada and other countries. "The espionage agency in certain countries in Europe is directed and funded by Colonel Zabotin (formerly the director of the military intelligence agency in Canada, who was later recalled to the Soviet Union) and his assistants. "The Soviet secret political police have a powerful agency in Canada. "In addition, several parallel secret agencies in Canada are directly directed by the Soviet Embassy. They may still exist. "Soviet spies have also stolen extremely important political secret information, thereby spying on the various policies of the governments of the US, UK, and Canada. "There is also considerable evidence of the existence of a naval espionage agency. "There is also a secret political agency, headed by Gorsalov, the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy, which specializes in directing communist activities.</p>

<p>[Gaejoosa, Nanjing, 16th] Before departing for the US from here yesterday, General He Yingqin issued a statement saying: The best impression I received in Tokyo was MacArthur's political contribution to Japan, which was even greater than his contribution as a soldier. I firmly believe that under MacArthur's leadership, Japan will be able to smoothly move towards the path of democracy. Japan suffered direct war damage for only one year, while China suffered eight years of war damage, and most cities were destroyed. The Chinese people have suffered greatly, which the Japanese cannot imagine. Japanese leaders only thought about the development of the military and economic economy and ignored political reforms, which is the reason for indulging in the abuse of force and also the reason for trapping Japan in today's plight. However, if the Japanese people abandon their policy of aggression in the future and turn their efforts in the war to peace and construction, they will surely make a great contribution to world peace. China's foreign policy is to be kind and neighborly and to convince people with virtue. I hope that Japan will become a democratic country and work together for the happiness of all mankind in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Yugoslav Partisan Leader Sentenced to Death: Execution Set for Today; Appeal on Eight Major Charges Rejected <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 16th: It has been broadcast that former Yugoslav Partisan Commander Mihailović has been sentenced to death and is scheduled to be executed by firing squad tomorrow. His appeal has been rejected.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] General Mihailović, former Yugoslav Partisan leader, was recently sentenced to death by the pro-Soviet government. Former Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States, Fotić, citing Mihailović's assistance in rescuing American airmen during the war, for which he is highly regarded in the United States, today requested President Truman to intervene and prevent Mihailović's execution.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 15th] Mihailović was sentenced to death by a military tribunal yesterday. He has been granted eight and a half hours to petition the Yugoslav parliament for clemency. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Mihailović and ten of his subordinates will be secretly executed.</p>
<p>Enumeration of Charges</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 15th] Mihailović is charged with eight major offenses: (1) Colluding with the aggressors and engaging in terrorist activities to suppress the Yugoslav people's resistance movement. (2) Joining traitors to oppose the liberation movement. (3) Engaging in military and political conspiracy with Germany. (4) Using the slogan of protecting the Slavic nation as a pretext to undermine Slavic unity. (5) Opposing communism and instigating civil war. (6) Obeying the orders of the exiled Yugoslav government, which stated that "fighting the enemy is not yet the time," thereby weakening Yugoslavia's fighting capacity. (7) Inciting ethnic hatred. (8) Colluding with Gestapo personnel to organize terrorist groups after the country's liberation. Following the sentencing, the defendants' lawyers, representing the families of the accused, petitioned the Presidium of the National Assembly for amnesty.</p>
<p>Tito's Remarks</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] A telegram from Belgrade states that Marshal Tito, in a speech given today in Montenegro, said that the verdict against Mihailović and others is equivalent to a verdict against international reactionaries. Although anti-Yugoslav elements are unwilling to accept the Four Foreign Ministers' decision regarding the port of Trieste, they do not intend to engage in adventurous actions, but will continue to strive through legal channels to persuade Western nations to change their attitude towards Yugoslavia. This trial shows that while reactionary forces are connected, democratic forces are also connected. Mihailović colluded with all reactionary forces, but the reactionaries ultimately failed. Now, the reactionaries are attempting to seize Istria, Trieste, and the Julian March, which belong to our country, as revenge.</p>
<h3 id="e57">German War's End; Plan to Bomb New York: Design and Manufacture of Super Bombers; Full Development of Rocket Weapons <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The U.S. Army Air Forces announced today that scientists under Hitler had designed and manufactured super bombers to bomb New York. This was one of 136 secret weapons that Germany was striving to complete or improve at the end of the war. According to Putt, Deputy Director of the Technical Intelligence Division of the Air Materiel Command, these bombers were expected to ascend to 114 miles above the ground, but they were not completed. The Germans hoped to use one hundred of these aircraft to destroy any city on Earth with several days of bombing. Germany designed a long-range flying-wing rocket intended to carry small rockets, launching from a specific location at a speed of 5,800 miles per hour. This weapon had a range of approximately 3,000 miles, sufficient to cross the Atlantic. Other weapons included rockets to destroy the United Nations' air forces and rockets utilizing all existing remote control and ignition methods, such as radio, radar, sound, infrared, and magnetic force. All methods of propulsion using rockets were fully developed. Germany made significant progress with jet engines, which could generate 4,400 pounds of thrust and achieve a speed of 500 miles per hour. Fritz X radio-controlled bombs, capable of penetrating armor, were deployed against United Nations ships at Salerno. In January 1945, the largest-scale manufacturer produced butterfly-shaped rockets, controlled by radio, to counter bombing raids. The greatest development in explosives by the Nazis was the V-2 rocket, with a range of 250 miles and a maximum speed of 3,500 miles per hour. A total of 10,000 of these were manufactured. During the three months that these bombs were used, they accounted for one-tenth of the British casualties from aerial bombing. The Greater London area was struck by 2,351 V-2 rockets, killing 5,476 people and destroying 23,000 buildings.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Full Text of Byrnes's Speech <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a national broadcast this evening, reporting to the nation on the results of the recent Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. The full text of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>After every major war, the victorious nations feel the difficulty and disappointment of the work of peacemaking. Even in the case of the United States after the War of Independence, it took five years for the thirteen states, in disagreement over domestic issues, to formulate a constitution that would protect lasting peace within the country. The creation of world peace, and the reconciliation of differing views, all require greater tolerance and understanding. To seek the most perfect decision, accept it, and then implement it; the creation of world peace requires this kind of intent and ability. Just as war fuels disaster, we can also strengthen peace with peace. Therefore, two months after the victory in Europe last summer, President Truman and I decided at Potsdam to establish a Council of Foreign Ministers to begin the work of peacemaking, and we wholeheartedly hoped to achieve peace in all regions. Judging from the situation at the time, concluding a peace treaty with Germany would obviously take a considerable amount of time. Since Germany did not have a government that was involved in the matter, we also had no agreement to stipulate a date for the establishment of a deceptive German government. It was also extremely clear that we should conclude peace treaties with Italy and other Axis satellite states. Since Italy and other countries still had governments, we immediately began work in this area.</p>
<p>Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>Over the past ten months, the world has been well aware of the arduous work we have done to eliminate differences of opinion among the major powers, draft peace treaties, and prepare for the convening of a peace conference. This work has now come to a successful conclusion, and it has been decided that the peace conference will be convened in Paris on July 29th. In addition to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, China, and the United States, sixteen other states that participated in the war against the Axis powers in Europe will also participate in the conference. Although the Council of Foreign Ministers has made suggestions regarding the organization and agenda of the peace conference, the conference can still decide its own organization and procedures. In the past, there were suggestions that meetings of subcommittees should be kept secret, but after our opposition, this suggestion was abandoned. I have stated that, as far as the United States is concerned, we believe that the proceedings of the conference and its committees should be made as public as possible. The task of the peace conference is only to make recommendations; the members of the Council of Foreign Ministers are responsible for drafting the final draft of the peace treaties and considering the recommendations of the conference, and they should not reject any of them without good reason. After the Council of Foreign Ministers has considered the recommendations of the conference and approved the final draft of the peace treaties, the treaties will be signed by representatives before the conference adjourns.</p>
<p>Draft Peace Treaties</p>
<p>The draft peace treaties approved by the various countries are not the best fruit of human wisdom, but they are indeed the best result that human wisdom can achieve with the unanimous agreement of the four major powers. The draft peace treaties will show that the attitude of the various countries towards restoring the world in a world filled with war clouds not only represents the opinions of the President and the Secretary of State, but also represents the opinions of Senators Connally and Vandenberg, who are rich in diplomatic experience and have a deep understanding of the work of concluding peace treaties and creating peace.</p>
<p>Greatest Dispute</p>
<p>The greatest dispute lies in the Italian treaty, and the biggest problem involved in that treaty is the fate of the port of Trieste and the territory along the western coast of the Istrian peninsula. The American representative, with the support of the British and French representatives, strongly advocated that the port of Trieste and its surrounding territory should remain with Italy, while the Slavic hinterland should belong to Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union strongly argued that Trieste and the surrounding territory should not be cut off from its direct hinterland. Although the Soviet Union acknowledged that several cities and towns along the coast did belong to the United States, it strongly argued that the Istrian peninsula should be regarded as a single territory, and since it is considered as a single territory, its sovereignty should naturally belong to Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia also supported this view. The Soviet Union further argued that greater consideration should be given to the demands of Yugoslavia than to the demands of Italy, because Italy was formerly an Axis partner and should be held responsible for fighting against the Allied nations and the loss of thousands of Allied lives; on the other hand, Yugoslavia had always fought alongside the Allied nations and had suffered the oppression of Italy. Since the Soviet Union and we were both unwilling to compromise, someone proposed that this issue be submitted to the peace conference, but the Soviet Union also disagreed with this point. Therefore, we were in a dilemma that was more serious than most people could imagine.</p>
<p>Separate Treaties</p>
<p>We could have concluded a treaty with Italy separately, ignoring Trieste, but the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav government, as well as several other governments, were unwilling to accept such a treaty. If we were to conclude a treaty separately, the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav government would inevitably demand that Italy also conclude a treaty with them separately, ceding Trieste to Yugoslavia. If Italy were to refuse, it is not difficult to foresee the difficulties that would arise from this. Even if no one offered a treaty to Italy, a disarmed Italy could only resist the Yugoslav army as long as our army was protecting Trieste. In an effort to break this deadlock, France informally proposed that the port of Trieste and its surrounding territory be separated from Italy, but not ceded to Yugoslavia, and that its security and integrity be guaranteed internationally. At first, no one made such a suggestion, but after careful study, this suggestion seemed reasonable and could serve as a basis for mutual agreement. Before Italy joined World War I, it had suggested that the Trieste region should become an autonomous state. My delegation insisted that the region should be protected by the United Nations, and not, as suggested by the Soviet Union, by the Italian and Yugoslav governments, nor, as suggested by France, by the four Allied powers.</p>
<p>Sovereignty of Trieste</p>
<p>This suggestion was finally agreed upon, with Gorizia and Monfalcone in the north being assigned to Italy, and the remaining area west of the mutually agreed ethnic line, including the Free Territory of Trieste. Indeed, sovereignty within the Free Territory of Trieste belongs to Italy, while sovereignty outside the territory belongs to the Slavs, but neither the Italians nor the Slavs within the territory are placed under foreign rule. They have domestic rule, the people will elect their own parliament, and the parliament will elect officials to enforce the laws. They will be supervised by the United Nations Security Council and a fair trustee appointed by the Security Council. The prosperity and welfare of the port of Trieste are not only related to Italy, but also to Yugoslavia and the countries of Central Europe. The port of Trieste is the natural outlet for Central Europe to the Mediterranean Sea, and the only railway leading to the port of Trieste passes through Yugoslavia and is managed by Yugoslavia. Representatives of the Yugoslav government strongly argued that if the port of Trieste were to be handed over to Italy, they would inevitably transfer their traffic to Hum, or other Yugoslav ports. Due to the animosity between the two nationalities in the region, United Nations control can be said to be the best way to avoid armed conflict and ease tensions. If the region were to join either Italy or Yugoslavia, its political and economic relations with the other country would inevitably suffer. Its industry may not be able to absorb the necessary capital, and workers may find it difficult to find work. If the Free Territory of Trieste can maintain friendly relations with its neighboring countries, this small territory may enjoy greater prosperity and become a greater source of solutions to problems for its neighboring countries, which would be more beneficial than joining either Italy or Yugoslavia. I firmly believe that if the parties concerned can work together, the solution to the Trieste issue will be extremely fair and have a chance of being realized. Unless they cooperate, the problem will not be solved.</p>
<p>Italian Colonies</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies, the various parties have not yet reached a final decision. We should remember that the Soviet Union originally had a demand to be entrusted with the trusteeship of Tripoli, and the Soviet Union said that it hoped to obtain a merchant shipping base in the Mediterranean region. France suggested that the various colonies be entrusted to Italy for trusteeship, and the Soviet Union also expressed its willingness to accept France's suggestion in April. The United Kingdom has expressed its support for our suggestion that Italian colonies be entrusted to the United Nations for trusteeship, except for the issue of Cyrenaica, which is still under consideration. In view of the difficulties of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the danger that the colonial issue would hinder the resolution of other issues, I suggested that the discussion of this issue be postponed. It was finally decided that the final disposal of the colonies should be decided by the four major powers after considering the wishes and welfare of the people of the various colonies, and taking into account the interests of other countries and world peace and security. If the four major powers can reach an agreement on the disposal of the colonies within one year after the peace treaties come into effect, they should handle the matter in accordance with the opinions on the disposal of colonial issues put forward by the United Nations General Assembly. The four major powers also agreed to send envoys to the various colonies to investigate the wishes of the local people. Until this issue is resolved, the Italian colonies will continue to be administered by the existing British military authorities. I am very satisfied with this matter, because the final decision on the colonial issue does not require the unanimous agreement of the four major powers. Even if the four major powers fail to reach an agreement, the United Nations can come forward to decide. The Soviet Union finally withdrew its opposition to the occupation of the Dodecanese Islands.</p>
<p>Reparations Issue</p>
<p>The issue of reparations is even more difficult. The Soviet Union insisted that it should receive at least $100 million in reparations from Italy. In addition, according to the armistice agreements signed by the Allied nations with Hungary, Romania, and Finland, the above-mentioned countries should each pay $300 million in reparations to the Soviet Union. For this reason, the Soviet Union's policy on reparations from Italy is also difficult to be lenient. On the other hand, we deeply feel that Italy has given us all kinds of assistance in the months before the end of the war, so we do not want it to bear the heavy burden of reparations, which would hinder its economic recovery. We had previously agreed that Italy could use its wartime factories within its borders, and the assets of Italian nationals in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, to offset the reparations. However, the Soviet Union insisted that Italy's reparations should be paid in currency or in products manufactured by Italian factories and shipyards in the future. Although we had no choice but to agree that the Soviet Union should receive reparations of $100 million, we made a request, believing that even if Italy paid the reparations with its products, the Soviet Union should find ways to transport these products to avoid hindering Italy's economic recovery. At the same time, we also requested that the Soviet Union grant Italy a grace period to start paying these reparations two years later. In order to avoid Italy borrowing money from us to buy raw materials to manufacture the goods that the Soviet Union would receive as reparations, we also requested that the Soviet Union supply Italy with the necessary manufacturing raw materials. There are still some issues in the peace treaties with Italy and other countries that have not been finally agreed upon. The Soviet delegation insisted that the Soviet Union would not agree to convene a peace conference until the four major powers had reached an agreement on their views on all basic issues. We believe that the Soviet Union does not consider this issue to be a basic issue and will accept the decision to convene a peace conference. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Jiaxing Kidnapping Case Cracked at Zhaofeng Park: Hostage Shakes Hands, Police Swarm Out; Bandit Leader "One-Eyed Dragon" Had Killed Two People <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] On June 9th, six bandits armed with four firearms went to the home of Lu Yangyun, a wealthy businessman in Jiaxing, and kidnapped his sixteen-year-old son, Lu Zhichao. They claimed to be from the New Fourth Army and stated that they were borrowing 50 million yuan due to insufficient military funds. Before leaving, they threatened that if the case were reported to the police, they would not only kill the hostage but also shoot the entire family. This case was cracked several days ago. It is reported that after kidnapping the hostage, the bandits took a boat from Zhao Family Village and traveled by water to Shanghai via Hengjing and Huangdu, hiding him somewhere in Zhoujiaqiao. Lu Yangyun reported the case to the Jiaxing County Government on the 10th. On the 13th, he received a letter asking him to negotiate at Zhuangjiajing, Jiwangmiao, on the 19th. Lu went there himself, but without results. On the 22nd, Lu entrusted Ni Binru and Tang Jiatao to return to the original location to negotiate, agreeing on a ransom of 12.5 million yuan, with an initial payment of 1 million yuan on the spot. On the 30th, another 3 million yuan was paid. On July 5th, they met in Shanghai and paid another 5.5 million yuan. On the appointed date, they paid another 4 million yuan at the Huierkang Cafe, and the hostage was released. However, the bandits refused to accept the 4 million yuan because it included a bank promissory note dated July 14th, insisting on cash. They then agreed to exchange the note for cash at the entrance of Zhaofeng Park between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM on July 10th. Afterwards, Lu reported the incident to the Changning Branch Bureau. On that day, Lu Zhichao went to the park entrance and saw the bandits waiting. He immediately stepped forward and pretended to shake hands. At that moment, Section Chief Shi and Officer Xu of the police bureau, who had been deployed all around, seized the opportunity to swarm out and arrest the bandits, taking them back to the bureau for interrogation. The bandit confessed that his name was Yao Wenhua, also known as Xiao Yao, nicknamed "One-Eyed Dragon." He also confessed that his accomplice, Wang Xin, was hiding at No. 8 Xinmin Inn, Wusong Road, Hongkou. Officers went to arrest him but failed to find him. He was later captured that night at the entrance of the Jiaxing Grand Theater. Yao Wenhua also confessed that during the enemy puppet period, he served as an intelligence officer for the enemy constabulary. He had disagreements with his colleague Li Wenbin and later killed Li. At that time, Li's family reported the incident to the Beixinjing puppet police station. The puppet police chief, Zhang Yiren, arrested Yao Wenhua and sent him to the puppet court, which sentenced him to eight months in prison. Yao was released on September 14th last year after serving his full sentence. Unexpectedly, at the Shenyanggen teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao, Yao encountered Zhang Yiren again. He lured Zhang to the wasteland near Gaojia Temple at the intersection of Huobili Road and Yulin Road, and together with two accomplices, killed Zhang, inflicting six fatal knife wounds. They then threw the body into a small ditch. There are still four bandits at large, and they are currently being pursued.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Debate on Assault and Battery Case Concludes; Sentencing Set for the 20th of This Month <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>On June 23rd, various organizations in this city held an anti-internal disorder parade, during which incidents of assault and battery occurred at locations such as Fuxing Park. After the District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution, the District Court initially heard the case on the morning of the 9th of this month. Yesterday morning, the court convened again, and the debate concluded, with sentencing scheduled for the 20th of this month. It is said that before the hearing, the majority of those in the audience were male and female students. The entire trial lasted three and a half hours, adjourning at 1:00 PM. The defendants in this case, Xu Damao, Zhu Jiangsheng (in custody), Diao Minzhi, and Ruan Guangyu (released on bail), hired lawyers Zhu Shaowen, Yu Zuoliang, and Sha Qianli to defend them. The plaintiffs, Yu Qingrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, Qiu Shengqing, and Yu Zhenhua, were represented by lawyers Duanmu Kai, E Sen, Yu Fuding, Lu Jiayi, and Zhao Zuwei, who entered the court successively. However, the four witnesses summoned this time, Lin Handa, Gu Qinliang, Huang Wanqing, and Li Zhaolin, did not appear in court. Presiding Judge Wu Shaochang continued to preside over the trial. The first to testify was the victim, Yu Zhenhua, who stated: "I study at Zhiye Middle School. At 12:45 PM on June 13th, I was distributing leaflets at the Risheng Lou and Yile Tian Lou, which led to me being dragged downstairs and beaten." Yu Jinrong stated: "I am a student at Zhonghua Vocational School. I was beaten while distributing leaflets on Henan Road and Nanjing Road, and my hands were tied behind my back and I was dragged onto a truck. Xu, Zhu, and others were all present, including a worker wearing a 'Patrol' armband." Zhang Yong stated: "At the time, I was reading in the library on the second floor of the YMCA when I was suddenly attacked by a group of people wielding wooden sticks. I was labeled a 'secret agent' and dragged onto a car, where the words 'Special Agent' were written on me with paint. I was then taken to Fuxing Park via Ma Lang Road. As for the weapons used by Xu and others, the police station can be consulted for verification." Finally, he testified in court that the perpetrators and guards were undoubtedly the defendants Xu and Zhu. At this point, Judge Wu questioned the defendant Xu Damao, who denied the assault and other actions, stating, "I never saw anyone distributing leaflets." Zhu Jiangsheng refuted the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the plaintiffs and witnesses during the previous hearing. Diao Minzhi strongly argued that he was not on the car as a guard and performed a demonstration in court, carrying a lead bucket and cloth bag, cunningly claiming that because he was carrying the tools for pasting slogans, he could not have hit anyone. Ruan Guangyu testified: "I was with the parade, from Gezhi Middle School to the North Railway Station. At 11:00 AM, while passing by the YMCA and other places, I did not see any fighting." Subsequently, the defendant's lawyers temporarily presented eight male and female witnesses, Zhang Peixin, Tang Guifen, Sun Jin, Xu Huiqing, Gu Liang, Liu A’gen, Liang Run, and Zhu Qingyan, who all unanimously stated: "Our parade team was walking on Avenue Edward VII when we heard something had happened ahead. We waited patiently and did not witness any fighting." After the questioning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng stood up and argued: "The defendants have already confessed to the police, and the facts are clear. They should be convicted according to the law for the crimes of joint injury and obstruction of freedom." Subsequently, the lawyers on both sides engaged in a fierce verbal battle, attacking each other's weaknesses. The defendant's lawyers argued that the defendants were motivated by patriotism and were acting to demand peace, and had not harmed anyone or obstructed their freedom. The trucks they prepared were for rescue purposes. The plaintiff's lawyers responded: "If it was a patriotic act, why did they beat people who were acting for the same goal? And why was a mimeograph machine placed inside the truck? Could a mimeograph machine be used for rescue? This shows that the defendant's actions were premeditated." Finally, the plaintiff's lawyers brought up the attached civil lawsuit, in which the victim Zhang Yong requested compensation for clothing and medical expenses totaling 498,000 yuan, Yu Jinrong requested 378,000 yuan, and He Xuechun requested 105,000 yuan. Judge Wu questioned the defendants again, who all replied that this was not the case and that they were not liable for compensation. At this point, after everyone in the court, including the plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses, signed and stamped their names, they were returned to custody or released on bail to await the verdict.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] US Army Lieutenant General Killen, stationed in China, presented Major General Liu Yaohan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Logistics Command of our Army Headquarters, with the Bronze Star Medal of Freedom at his office in the Datong Building at 2:00 PM yesterday. The award recognized his outstanding contributions and cooperative spirit to the US Army Logistics Command during his tenure from July 25th to August 14th, 1945. His excellent English was also praised by US military authorities.</p>
<p>Those who attended the award ceremony included US Army Headquarters Deputy Commander Colonel Rogers, Executive Director Colonel Tao, Intelligence Director Colonel Weton, Administrative Director Colonel Dunerci, and Chief Engineer Colonel Collinsk. The citation was read by US Army Adjutant Captain Link.</p>
<p>General Liu is from Hebei and is 39 years old. After graduating from middle school, he went to the United States to study at Carleton College. In 1944, he graduated from the US Army University. After returning to China, he served as a liaison officer for General Stilwell and participated in the Guilin-Liuzhou Conference as a member of the chairman’s delegation. He later served with General Stilwell in Burma. Subsequently, he served as the chairman’s personal liaison officer to General Wedemeyer. General Liu is currently stationed in Shanghai, representing the Logistics Commander in charge of military transportation. This is the second time Mr. Liu has received a medal from the United States. The first time was last year in Chongqing, when he and Minister Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and former Vice Minister of Military Administration Lin Weiwu were simultaneously awarded medals by General Wedemeyer. The award medal was signed by the late President Roosevelt, because General Liu and others received their awards in 1944, which were signed and issued by President Roosevelt.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters has been conducting intense joint court hearings on the grain loan case for several days. Yesterday, the person interrogated was Ren Xingyai. The hearing began at 9:00 AM and lasted until 5:00 PM. When he left the court, Li Zheng, the secretary of the office, vomited due to working at his desk all day, which shows how demanding the work of this case is. The hearing of various grain merchants will continue today. At the same time, the Association of Accountants will send staff to assist in checking the account books again, paying special attention to the profits of the grain merchants and whether there are any illegal profits.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Sheng Laosan, Shao Shijun, Qian Da Kui, etc. Lead Luxurious Lives, Acted Arrogantly, Confiscated Property of Traitors Is Shockingly Valuable, All Utensils Used Are Either Gold or Silver, Diamond Rings Are the Most Numerous Among the Ornaments <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>In the inventory of the confiscated property of traitors and collaborators, we can see the extravagant lives of ordinary traitors during the period of the Japanese occupation, who abused the people and acted tyrannically. For example, the utensils used in the homes of traitors such as Sheng Laosan, Shao Shijun, and Qian Da Kui were either gold or silver, showing an unparalleled extravagance. According to what this reporter learned, among the Shanghai traitors, those who had the most houses and real estate confiscated were Gu Huanzhang, Sheng Youxuan (i.e., Sheng Laosan), Wu Yong'an, Shao Shijun, and others. Those who had the most gold, silver, and diamond jewelry were Sheng Youxuan, Li Shiqun, Shao Shijun, Qian Da Kui, and others. Among these traitors, Sheng's property was the most extensive. The inventory of his confiscated property was 128 pages thick (each page lists 15 items of property), including 6 pages of real estate, 2 pages of promissory notes, 1 page of stocks, 21 pages of gold and silver jewelry, 1 page of gold and silver, 30 pages of furniture, and 67 pages of other items (including clothing and other miscellaneous items), which is twice as much as Shao's property. Among the jewelry, there was a platinum brooch inlaid with a nine-pointed star-shaped large diamond, with a 28-carat diamond in the center and about 160 small diamonds weighing about 15 carats around it, which is estimated to be worth more than 60 million yuan at the lowest estimate. In addition, there was a 24-carat large diamond "Longevity" brooch, as well as 20-carat and 18-carat or larger diamond rings, and more than 30 diamond rings ranging from 2 carats to less than 10 carats. The spittoons, smoking sets, ashtrays, small pedestals, and birdcages used by Sheng were all made of gold, and there were 47 large gold bars. The real estate confiscated included: two houses on Avenue Albert, a Western-style house on Avenue du Grand-Occident, six houses on Avenue Joffre, six houses on Rue Pere Huc, two houses at No. 1 and 2 Shengde Lane on Route Tenant de la Tour, four houses in Lane 1699 on Avenue Haig, 23 houses on Rue Lagrenée, a Western-style house on Route Cohen, a house at No. 118 Rue Pere Huc, 12 houses on Route Virmont, a garden villa in Hangzhou, six residences in Suzhou (one with 71 rooms and the other with 52 rooms), and 13 properties in Changzhou. Shao Shijun's real estate also occupied 6 pages in his confiscated property inventory, most of which were in Shanghai. The entire inventory consisted of 47 pages, including 6 pages of real estate, 6 pages of promissory notes, 3 pages of stocks, 18 pages of jewelry, 1 page of gold and silver, 5 pages of furniture, and 8 pages of other items. The most valuable items in Shao's jewelry were a diamond necklace inlaid with nine large diamonds totaling 37 carats and 77 small diamonds, and a diamond bracelet weighing 18 carats, as well as a single large diamond weighing 10 carats, and 20 to 30 diamond rings and diamond buttons weighing less than 10 carats. There were also seven [units missing] and two gold blocks. Because Shao was in [place missing], it is believed that all of his gold and silver jewelry are not included in this number. Qian Da Kui's confiscated property inventory consisted of 20 pages, with jewelry occupying 6 pages, gold and silver occupying 1 page, and real estate including a Western-style house at No. 1015 Rue du Lieutenant Petiot, a house bordering Avenue Joffre, five mu of land on Hongqiao Road, and a house in Taicang County. The opium smoking sets, teacups, and spittoons used by Qian were all made of gold, and diamond rings were also the most numerous among the ornaments. The largest was a single diamond ring weighing 54 carats, and there were 46 large gold bars, two gold bars weighing five taels each, and 20 small gold bars. In summary, the total value of the confiscated property of these three traitors is shocking. Therefore, it is generally estimated that the value of the confiscated property in Shanghai (the previous estimate released by the Xingju was about 50 billion yuan) is more than 50 billion yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e67">A Batch of German and Japanese Houses Allocated to Various Organizations; Entry with Permits Shall Not Be Obstructed <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Committee for the Allocation of Houses for Shanghai Agencies of the Executive Yuan held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon. It was resolved that approximately 20 houses of Japanese residents would be allocated to 18 organizations, including the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee, the China Science and Education Society, the Central Party Headquarters, the US-China Cooperation Institute Shanghai Office, the China Textile Machinery Company, China Public School, the East China News Agency, the Chinese Economic Society, the China Education and Culture Fund Board of Directors, the Shanghai Journalists Association, the Welfare Society, the Shanghai Postal Workers Society, the Financial Reporting Agency, the Nanyang Bulletin, Zhengqi Daily, the Material Supply Bureau Import Design Special Committee, the Freedom Forum, and the Two-Way Railway Administration.</p>
<p>The allocation of German houses has been completed. The committee has created a list and allocated them to President Chiang’s American pilot, the US Navy, the US, Canadian, and Panamanian consuls, the American Red Cross, the British War Crimes Investigation Team, the Women's Work Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Training Director Review Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, the Whampoa Military Academy Communication Office, the German Property Clearance Office, the Executive Yuan Material Supply Bureau, the Ministry of Military Administration Medical Administration Department, the Armored Corps Training Team, personnel from various departments of the Municipal Government, and other organizations. Some houses are allocated by the building, and some are allocated by the room, with varying sizes, totaling approximately 50 locations. In addition, the committee has specially designated Hongqiao Sanatorium Hospital at No. 201 Hongqiao Road for German residents to live together. There are also approximately 20 houses for the relocation and consolidation of German residents. The committee will issue notices in the coming days, ordering German residents to comply. Approximately 30 houses are too small or have complex situations and will not be allocated for the time being, and are currently being sealed.</p>
<p>Any organizations and groups allocated houses who have obtained a permit from the committee and are moving in, if they encounter obstruction, Director Wu can provide full support and assistance. As for houses occupied by German and Austrian residents who have not been evacuated, no disputes may occur beforehand. The authorities have ordered the committee to pay close attention to this matter.</p>
<p>The committee hopes to conclude its work by the end of August, after allocating all the houses occupied by various organizations without signed leases.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Hartung Inheritance Dispute Expected to Be Resolved Soon; George Recognized as the Main Heir <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to this reporter's inquiries from relevant sources, the inheritance dispute of the Jewish businessman Hartung in this city, which has been in litigation for many years, will soon be resolved peacefully. Hartung's heirs will donate three plots of land, respectively, to the National Government, the Municipal Government, and as a fund for charitable causes. The value of this land is estimated at more than 10 million yuan, based on the currency value in 1941. Hartung's inheritance has been subject to complex disputes since the death of Hartung's wife, Luo Jialing, in October 1941. Initially, there was the so-called dual case of the 1931 will and the 1937 will. The former designated Hartung's adopted son, George, as the main heir, while the latter designated Hartung's comprador, Ji Juemi, and Luo Jialing's adopted sons and daughters as the main heirs. The two sides sued each other for a long time without a resolution. In 1942, twelve Jews who claimed to be relatives of Hartung, including Esra Sassoon Hartung, filed a lawsuit requesting to take over the management of Hartung's estate, further complicating the case. At that time, Shanghai was under the control of the enemy and puppets. According to newspaper reports, the puppet court designated Jin Dingxun and two others as estate administrators. Subsequently, the puppet Ministry of Justice Administration ordered the revocation, as the case was purely a private rights dispute. The lawsuit between the two sides ended without a resolution. After the victory, through mediation by various parties, Luo Jialing's adopted children have agreed to recognize George as the main heir. Currently, only Ji Juemi has not fully agreed, but according to relevant parties, there should be no further major complications. As for the twelve people who claimed to be relatives of Hartung, they had already sued Luo Jialing and lost the lawsuit when Hartung passed away, so they should know that it is difficult to succeed this time.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Conversation with Li Fusun, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Li Fusun, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, returned from the United States at the end of April. Our reporter attempted to interview him once but was unable to have a thorough discussion. Yesterday, we visited him again, and the reporter asked several questions. Mr. Li was kind enough to answer them in person. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, you were appointed by the government as a member of the Supreme Economic Council. Can we hear your suggestions on various national economic measures?</p>
<p>(Answer) After my appointment, the Supreme Economic Council has not yet met, so I have no concrete opinions. I privately believe that our country's agriculture, industry, and commerce have always lagged behind. The eight years of the War of Resistance have caused enormous losses in manpower and material resources. From now on, all national manpower and material resources should be fully used for productive construction. I sincerely hope that a peaceful era will truly unfold so that various plans can be put into practice. Construction is a major undertaking and requires a large amount of capital. We should be diligent, thrifty, and endure hardship, accumulate capital, and guide it well. At the same time, we should attract foreign investment and cooperate with it. What we should pay attention to is the "guidance" and "attraction" of capital. The direction of capital movement is nothing more than safety and profit. Therefore, the safety and profit conditions of investment must be vigorously promoted so that domestic and foreign capital will easily converge. As for the manpower required for construction, we have plenty of labor. The start of various construction projects can solve the employment problem for the people. We still feel that we lack technical personnel. We should recruit foreign talent to assist in the work and provide training.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on the boundary between state-owned and private enterprises?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding this point, Chairman Chiang mentioned the principles and gave specific examples in his broadcast speech on the eve of the 34th National Day, roughly saying, "...There should be a clear division between the types of state-owned and private enterprises... All enterprises that are national in scope, monopolistic, and difficult for the people to undertake, such as the steel industry, national railways, and large-scale hydropower plants, should be state-owned. Other economic enterprises can be widely operated by the people... Our national construction plan should aim at the welfare of the people. The people's economic freedom should be protected by the overall national plan. This is the meaning of our ancient teaching, 'storing wealth among the people.'" Also, at the 33rd International Business Conference in New York at the Repair Workers' Union, I was also one of the representatives. I received a telegram from the government regarding the main points of the private enterprise system and commercial policies, roughly saying, "...Enterprises that cannot be entrusted to individuals or are monopolistic should be operated by the state. All enterprises that can be entrusted to individuals or are more suitable for private operation than state operation should be operated by individuals and encouraged by the state and protected by law." It also said: "Our country's enterprises, whether state-owned or private, may accept foreign investment." After returning to the country, I went to Beijing last month to meet with Chairman Chiang and received further instructions. The original policy and boundaries will not change and must be implemented soon. Premier Song of the Executive Yuan has also repeatedly stated that the temporary state operation of certain enterprises after the war is a matter of expediency and will eventually be transferred to private operation. The principles stated by the government are very clear, and the boundaries are also quite clear. However, we hope that they will be implemented as soon as possible so that entrepreneurs can operate with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on the reform of our country's monetary system?</p>
<p>(Answer) The stability of the monetary system is paramount and is closely related to other economic items. The main part of the stabilization work is currently being carried out by the Central Bank and is proving to be quite effective. Recently, many people believe that the exchange rate of the national currency is too high. This is not unreasonable. However, when the government set the current exchange rate, it really wanted to avoid stimulating prices and causing losses to the people. As long as the country is stable, transportation is restored, production increases, and exports are smooth, the value of the currency will naturally be stable. I deeply feel that the Central Bank attaches great importance to the credit of the national currency and will not easily change the current exchange rate. Speculators in gold and foreign currencies may inevitably incur losses.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on the domestic financial situation after the war?</p>
<p>(Answer) In terms of finance, what I have observed since returning to the country differs from before the war in two main ways: first, the number of banks has increased significantly; second, prudent operation is not yet widespread. In my humble opinion, the main source of operating funds for banks is deposits. Now, in terms of the "quality" of bank deposits, they are actually much lower than before the war, and almost all are demand deposits, which are highly volatile. Under these circumstances, bank lending operations must be particularly cautious. If banks make imprudent loans, or even engage in covert speculation, such as buying and selling gold and US dollars, or even directly operating in the buying and selling of goods, it will not only endanger themselves but also have a great impact on the entire financial market and the entire society. Although banks are profit-seeking organizations, they should have social goals and a national concept in addition to profit-making. Therefore, prudence is a proactive approach and not a passive attitude. I hope that all colleagues will not take chances, adhere to the right track, and not forget their social goals and national concepts, so that we can jointly seek long-term development.</p>
<p>(Question) You just said that prudent operation is not yet widespread. What are some examples?</p>
<p>(Answer) Many banks are doing acceptances and bill discounts, but some of them are inevitably related to bills that are not based on genuine trade, and some have not obtained reliable collateral. The acceptance or discount procedures are not in line with government regulations, and some even pay no attention to the background and credit of the bill debtors. In European and American countries, accepted bills are the best and most important credit instrument, and bill discounting is the most important lending business for banks. In our country's business and financial circles, we should carefully examine the truth and earnestly promote them. It would be a great mistake to abuse this good name. In addition, the so-called "guarantee" of post-dated checks is particularly dangerous and clearly contradicts legal regulations.</p>
<p>(Question) Recently, at the end of June, the money market was extremely tight. What is the reason?</p>
<p>(Answer) The tightness of the money market at the end of June was due to three reasons: first, industries and businesses had a large amount of taxes due, which were summarized and paid to the Central Bank at the end of the month, so the deposits of various banks and firms suddenly flowed into the Central Bank, which collected the taxes. Second, the silver and money industries had a mid-year settlement holiday, which lasted three days including Sunday. Customers who received cash usually deposited it in banks and firms, but temporarily did not deposit it because of the holiday. Third, the illiquidity of the Great Asia Bank caused market anxiety. Under normal circumstances, banks and firms with prudent operations maintain a relatively high level of daily payment reserves, so their payment ability is still sufficient, and they can temporarily lend to their colleagues to provide some assistance.</p>
<p>(Question) It is said that the Central Bank has refused to grant loan requests from banks and firms. From the perspective of the Central Bank's position and mission, how should this be viewed?</p>
<p>(Answer) As far as I know, the current policy adopted by the Central Bank focuses on tightening. In my humble opinion, this policy is very appropriate today when various speculative trends have not yet subsided and the business of banks and firms has not yet become universally stable. In fact, the Central Bank is certainly willing to make adjustments for prudent colleagues when necessary. Also, when various colleagues undertake important and legitimate lending but their own funds are insufficient, such as the spring fertilizer loans for the silver and money industries this year, the Central Bank has also provided appropriate assistance.</p>
<p>(Question) It is said that the Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Joint Reserve Association is about to be established, which will be very helpful to various banks and firms in the future. It is also said that the Shanghai Clearing House will also be reorganized. What are the measures?</p>
<p>(Answer) When the "January 28th" First Shanghai Incident began in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the Shanghai financial industry was the first to be affected, and its payment ability suddenly became short. Banks urgently convened a meeting to deal with the situation and jointly initiated the establishment of the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Association, which centralized assets to make adjustments. The money industry also established a joint reserve treasury, which stabilized the market. Later, during the turmoil in the money industry in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], during the Second Shanghai Incident in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], and during the run on deposits in the silver and money industries in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], it made great contributions to colleagues and society. In July of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], the Ministry of Finance formulated the principles for silver and money industries to establish joint reserve associations in Chongqing and ordered them to be promoted in various places. Many of the measures adopted the original Shanghai system. After Shanghai was recovered, the city's finances were being reorganized. The banking industry reserve association and the money industry reserve treasury, due to the original business during the war, such as interbank deposits and interbank lending, etc., either have other appropriate affiliations or are temporarily not needed, so the banking industry reserve association is still suspended, and the money industry reserve treasury has been closed. This spring, the silver and money industries associations, in view of the unstable situation of the financial industry in the city and the lack of a mutual assistance center among colleagues, proposed to rebuild the joint reserve system. After returning to the country, I consulted with the Central Bank authorities, who all agreed that the joint reserve system could be an arm of the Central Bank and agreed with it. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has approved the establishment, and a covenant will be signed soon. In the future, while colleagues have this center for gathering strength, they must also strive for prudence, consolidate the foundation, and have a consistent pace so that collective security can be ensured. We must know that after the new reserve association is established, interbank lending will only be carried out for temporary adjustments when truly necessary, and it cannot be used to supply operating funds to general colleagues. Therefore, colleagues should not have excessive expectations for the new reserve association. As for the Clearing House, the silver and money industries and foreign banks used to operate separately. Last year, when Shanghai was liberated, the silver and money industries followed the instructions of the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance and organized a unified Clearing House. At that time, in order to quickly complete the unification work, the Central Bank appointed members of the Clearing House to manage the affairs of the Clearing House with the approval of the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance. When I returned to the country, I happened to be at the time when the silver and money industries associations had completed their re-election. The Central Bank authorities, in accordance with the practice of allied countries, believed that in large cities with a large number of negotiable instruments, a non-profit organization nature Clearing House should be established by the financial industry itself to specialize in the clearing of negotiable instruments. Therefore, they instructed the silver and money industries to elect executive members of the Clearing House themselves and be supervised by the Central Bank to comply with the system. The two associations decided to do so. Therefore, the reorganization of the Clearing House is actually only the re-election of the members of the Clearing House.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on the current municipal administration of this city?</p>
<p>(Answer) After Mayor Wu took office, he governed with a decisive style, such as the adjustment of city tax revenue, which is sufficient to reduce the burden on citizens, and the control of the rice market and the handling of labor-management issues, which are all difficult matters and the measures are very wise. In addition, he has made every effort to rectify social morality, which has refreshed the views of both Chinese and foreigners and has been widely praised. Secretary-General He is a virtuous and upright scholar who, with his experience in serving in the Municipal Council before the war and as Deputy Mayor after the victory, is Mayor Wu's right-hand man. It can be said that they complement each other. What I personally hope is that all citizens of the city should understand that every citizen has a responsibility for the improvement of the city's administration and should assist in promoting public facilities so that the city's construction work will become more smooth.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Aukin Laihai, a 22-year-old American, was a sailor on the American merchant ship "　Tuo La," which was docked at the Kai 　Wharf in Nikkei Harbor. At 3:30 a.m. on June 30th of this year, Aukin Laihai stole eighty-two cartons of cigarettes from the ship. The captain, Fulai Duo, discovered it and reported it to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye tried the case in the Third Criminal Court. Sun Zhaozhang, a lawyer selected by the US Consulate, was appointed to defend him in court. According to his confession, his monthly salary was only US$145. He had an elderly mother at home, and US$100 had to be sent home for living expenses. The remaining US$45 was not enough to use in Shanghai, so he was confused for a while and stole the cigarettes. He had already sold eighteen cartons for US$25, and the rest had been recovered. Subsequently, Lawyer Kong stated that the defendant was young and had a family burden, had never committed a crime before, and had expressed remorse today. He should be given a lenient sentence. Judge Ye then announced in court that "the defendant is guilty of theft and is sentenced to three months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence." After Lawyer Kong explained the meaning of the suspended sentence to the defendant, the defendant indicated his acceptance of the sentence in court and was released on bail. It is reported that the defendant has been detained for two weeks.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, our reporter met with Mr. Hailishi, a British shipowner who successfully test-ran a landing craft on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for the first time, and inquired about the test run. According to him, he has test-run landing craft on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River many times. During the first small-water test run, the water level in Yichang was only four feet one inch deep. During the second medium-water test run, the water depth was fourteen feet. During the third high-water test run, the water depth was more than twenty feet. During the fourth high-water test run, the water depth was more than forty feet. All the test runs were successful. As a result of the test runs, a water depth of between twenty and thirty feet is the most suitable. He said that the rudder of this landing craft should be modified to be larger. Although some ships have been modified to be larger, they are still not very suitable. It is said that there will be a total of fifteen landing craft sailing on the Yangtze River in the future. Among them, China Merchants Bureau has ten ships and Minsheng Company has five ships. He has now been hired by the Executive Yuan as a teacher to train landing craft drivers.

According to Haili, he has been working for Minsheng Company for fifteen years. During the War of Resistance, he always sailed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. He is especially familiar with piloting on the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Report from Nanjing] The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to promoting educational television. The original plan was to complete the establishment of the National Educational Broadcasting Station (the name has not been completely finalized, it may be named the National China Educational Broadcasting Station) in the first half of the 35th year, and start broadcasting in the second half of the year. However, the return to the capital and post-war recovery slowed progress, and this plan was delayed. It was not until July of this year that the plan was completely finalized, and preparations for the establishment were immediately carried out. Broadcasting equipment has been purchased from the United States, a site has been selected in the capital, and design and management are underway. It is estimated that broadcasting can begin in January next year. If this station is established, not only will social education be greatly promoted, but school education will also receive good guidance. At designated times, the whole country can use radios to enter the "Air University" and attend classes everywhere. Furthermore, the promulgation and revision of educational laws and regulations, and the slow delivery of official documents from distant places, can be quickly and promptly known through this broadcast. This educational broadcasting station has the following three missions: (1) to implement air broadcasting-style education at all levels of schools; (2) to promote social education through broadcasting; (3) to facilitate the dissemination of new educational laws and regulations. National educational institutions and schools, as well as provincial and municipal education departments, must have adequate radio reception equipment and must designate specialists to be responsible for the transmission of radio education news and regulations.

<p>Central Library - Millions of Volumes of Ancient Books</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] The National Central Library of China is currently running out of space in its storage rooms, resulting in millions of volumes of ancient books that cannot be accommodated. In 1937, it was originally planned to build a new library, and the government had allocated a budget of 1.5 million yuan for construction costs. However, due to the Sino-Japanese War, this did not materialize. Today, if built according to the original standards, it would require 1 billion yuan, but the government is only willing to allocate 100 million yuan, which is far from sufficient.

<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] Chaoyang College has a history of more than 30 years in Beiping. During the War of Resistance against Japan, it moved to Sichuan and continued classes at Xinglongchang in Ba County. After the victory, universities that had moved inland returned to their original locations one after another. Chaoyang College was no exception, causing high school graduates in Sichuan Province to feel the pain of having nowhere to go to college. Moreover, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent, the country needs legal talents. Based on the above two points, the establishment of Chaoyang College in Chongqing was founded. According to the Ministry's order, independent colleges cannot establish branch colleges. Therefore, the old and new campuses can only be named Beiping and Chongqing, respectively, but in fact, they are still sister schools, both of which are headed by Ju Zheng and Xia Qin as president and vice president. When the Yu campus opened in the spring of this year, due to limited funds, only evening classes in the law department were established, with one upper and one lower class, totaling more than 200 people. Recently, the college's board of directors has been working hard to raise funds, add school equipment, and receive hundreds of thousands of books from the Beiping Chaoyang Library in Xinglongchang, actively preparing for day classes. It is heard that day and night classes will be able to enroll students at the same time in the next semester.</p>

<p>Please Cancel the Resolution to Demolish Thatched Houses</p>
<p>The residents of the 14th District, 6th Bao, Datong Road, Gonghe New Road, in this city are all refugees from Northern Jiangsu who gathered several months ago to build thatched houses to live in. However, all the base areas belong to the Beijing-Shanghai District Railway Administration. The bureau recently planned to demolish the thatched houses along the road. The residents believe that at a time when the housing shortage is serious, and they are all refugees, they will have no place to live once the houses are demolished. Therefore, last month, they jointly petitioned the District Office to transfer a letter to the Railway Bureau, requesting the cancellation of the resolution to demolish the thatched houses. Recently, a reply was received stating that the matter concerns the reorganization of railway property and cannot be implemented. Upon hearing this, the residents were alarmed and filed an emergency appeal to the Railway Bureau again the day before yesterday, and submitted a letter of suggestion, requesting adoption.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] Regarding the question of whether or not the Zhejiang Provincial Games will be held this year, this reporter recently interviewed a person in charge of the Department of Education. According to them, the original site of the Provincial Sports Ground in front of the Gongyuan was taken over, but it was converted into a military camp during the enemy-puppet period, and the grounds and all equipment were completely destroyed. Therefore, the cost of organizing and repairing the grounds would be huge and the repairs cannot be completed in the short term, resulting in a lack of venues. In addition, due to various reasons such as transportation costs, it is not planned to hold the Provincial Games this year. Only regional games will be held separately in each administrative region, but this will depend on the financial situation of each region. (Skinny)</p>

I am deeply honored to have been ordered to come to Zhejiang to serve the educational cause of my hometown. In the future, the educational policy must first achieve the integration of education and application. Education is not merely an ornament; it must be applied to practical use. The cultivation of talent should meet the needs of China. Second, we must provide education according to aptitude. Humans are divided into those of superior, inferior, and average intelligence. Who should be taught for advanced studies, who should be taught life skills, and who should be given moral education should all be determined according to individual circumstances in order to achieve the effectiveness of education. Third, we should cultivate production skills. At the beginning of the recovery period, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, we must strive for the development of production. Cultivating production skills should be the most urgent task at present. Fourth, the education of talent must be in line with the national reconstruction policy. We must not be overly ambitious or stick to old conventions. The current problem lies in how to rebuild the country, so the direction of education must immediately follow the road of national reconstruction and advance in order to cooperate with the national policy. I am a native of Zhejiang, but I have been away from Zhejiang for a long time. I still need to observe the actual situation in the province. In the future, I will follow the instructions of the central government, refer to the local conditions, and take measures step by step. It is also heard that only Zhong Weishi came with Mr. Li on this trip to Hangzhou to take office." (Butterfly)</p>

<p>Commercial News: Export Packing Loans at 6% Annual Interest with 70% Loan Value; Can Be Re-Mortgaged with Letters of Credit</p>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, in order to encourage exports, the Central Bank initiated export packing loans to facilitate funding for exporters. In order to understand the loan measures, this reporter visited an authorized foreign exchange bank yesterday. They informed me that these loans started to be processed successively from mid-June. There are generally two types: (1) Exporters holding letters of credit can apply for loans from designated banks with their letters of credit. The designated bank will lend 70% of the amount stated on the letter of credit, calculated at an annual interest rate of 6%. Once the exporter's goods have been shipped, they can submit the bill of lading, insurance policy, and all supporting documents listed on the letter of credit to the designated bank that provided the original loan to complete the repayment procedure. After receiving these documents, the designated bank will calculate the interest from the date of the loan to the date of submission of the documents, plus one month of interest, as it is estimated that it will take about one month from the time the exporter's documents are sent to the United States until the payment is received in the United States. The designated bank undertaking this loan may re-mortgage to the Central Bank with the exporter's letter of credit at an annual interest rate of 4%. The term of the loan is three months. (2) Exporters who do not hold letters of credit apply for loans, which are handled at the discretion of each designated bank. The decision to grant the loan or not is generally based on the amount of foreign exchange held by the bank itself and the exporter's creditworthiness. The term of the loan is six months. However, the Central Bank does not accept re-mortgages. It is understood that for exporters holding letters of credit, their goods have already been shipped to Shanghai. Conversely, their goods are likely to be held up in other ports. For both types of export loans, if the exporter stops shipping the goods abroad or fails to sell the foreign exchange to the designated bank that provided the original loan on time, the loan will be calculated at the prevailing domestic interest rate. At the same time, all designated banks will be notified to refuse to deal with the exporter in the future. The designated bank also expressed the hope that the Central Bank would allow designated banks to handle re-mortgages for the second type of export loan. They also hoped that if the exporter were to default, the Central Bank would compensate for the foreign exchange losses incurred by the designated bank. This reporter then inquired with relevant parties about this matter, who stated that if the Central Bank were to compensate for this loss, it would be equivalent to opening a loophole in foreign exchange resources, which would be difficult to implement.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Money Market is Loose; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise in a Straight Line <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to be actively bought yesterday. Liquidity was excessively abundant. With nowhere else to turn, silver firms and pawnshops continued to pour into the stock market. From the morning opening, various stocks gradually rose, with very few setbacks along the way. Small stocks were even more arrogant. High prices were seen throughout the morning. Near the closing, there was a slight consolidation. Smaller and less active stocks such as Match, Sino-French, Underwear, and New Asia continued to be absorbed by investors. Old established stocks also showed activity. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On, Shanghai Silk, and Meyer rose by more than 50%, while Jingfu, New Light, and Qinxing rose by more than 150%. Smaller, less active stocks also rose by 50% to 100%. Old established stocks made slight gains.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were suddenly absorbed by Sichuan individual investors. The buying intention was unusually strong. At the same time, there were rumors in the market that foreign stocks would be auctioned in Hong Kong. The upward trend was therefore stronger. Ewo Silk rose from 8,800 yuan in the morning to 9,500 yuan. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels rose gradually from 9,100 yuan to 10,500 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, stocks rose in order of the degree of rumor-driven buying, with Ye Guang rising by slightly less than 100%, and the rest rising sharply by around 150%.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Gold and Currency Markets are Quiet <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Gold continued its previous path, meandering within a short distance in an extremely mediocre situation. The opening was stable. After opening, it rose from 1,942,000 following the US dollar to 1,955,000. However, the upward trend stopped there and turned to meandering. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 73 bars at a price of 1,947,500. Thereafter, until noon, it struggled around 1,950,000. At the beginning of noon, it fell to 1,940,000. Later, due to the opening of next-day trading, it rebounded slightly. As a result, there was little difference compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars did not change. Black market interest was flat and loose, with interest rates remaining at only about 1.5%.</p>
<p>The US dollar had some spot settlements, and the situation improved slightly. Since the morning opening at 2,470 yuan, buyers have been actively trading. By noon, it had risen to over 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell slightly and remained within the 2,500 yuan range. The situation then became sluggish again. As a result, it rose 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar notes were initially firm and then flat, reaching as high as over 570 yuan before settling down slightly. As a result, it was still up 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 560 yuan to 570 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 685 yuan to 695 yuan, the British exchange rate was 9,100 to 9,200 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still inactive.</p>

<p>Dried Seafood Shows Mixed Fortunes</p>
<p>May and June are usually the off-season for dried seafood. Most items are sluggish except for those that are sold in a timely manner. For example, the supply of Coix seeds is very scarce, and sales are in season, so the situation is quite tight. Auctioned Agar-Agar has a large supply. Although it has fallen, its sales are not weak and it is still relatively active. Wood ear and hair seaweed prices have increased due to shortages in the producing areas, so prices are firm. Items such as shrimp tails, raw flour, Qicai, pepper, fennel, sago, and seaweed are sluggish in sales and are all weak.</p>

<p>The mid-summer period is usually the peak season for domestic sales of tea. Therefore, buyers from all over have been actively purchasing in recent days, striving to drag it in. Fortunately, the supply and demand are corresponding, and there is no difference in price. However, among them, Wuyuan's newly fried green tea is particularly popular due to the large number of buyers, resulting in an unusually strong price of 180,000 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>In the coal market, screened white coal has been hoarded by holders due to the depletion of existing inventory. The arrival of Yangquan white coal, which is expected to arrive in the next few days, is also being closely watched by them. As a result, there is a shortage of goods circulating in the market, and those who need it are raising prices to compete for purchase, and the market has risen again. White coal powder is also actively sold because the price of coal lumps has increased. The market situation for bituminous coal lumps and coal powder is the same as before. Lumps are very popular and the market price is strong, while powder is sluggish and the market price is weak. Firewood and charcoal prices have risen slightly due to reported price increases in the producing areas.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to soar yesterday. Double Horse still has outlets in South China and rose by another 60,000. The increases in the remaining Jin Cheng and Dafa yarn prices were also 40,000 to 50,000. The gains in smaller and medium-sized yarn prices slowed slightly, rising by only 20,000 to 30,000. Although transactions were sparse, people's confidence was quite firm.</p>

<p>Since the United States lifted price controls, US prices have soared. Even cotton, which has a large existing inventory, has risen from 30 cents per pound to 35 cents. The US authorities therefore issued a ban on US cotton exports some days ago. According to a source in the textile industry, this increase in US cotton prices and the US government's announcement of a ban on cotton exports have no impact on our country. The total cotton stock in our country is more than 800,000 bales, which is sufficient for one year's needs. Furthermore, manufacturers have ordered a large number of US cotton from the United States. As for the $60 million US cotton loan agreed upon by the Central Bank and the United States, only a small portion has been used. Although the US government has announced a ban on US cotton exports, those with existing contracts are not affected. In addition, the cotton producing areas in various parts of our country have a very abundant production this year. The transportation problem can be solved and the supply will naturally be balanced.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 16th] The US Department of Commerce's "Foreign Trade Weekly" stated that the textile industry is Italy's only most important export industry. Among them, the cotton textile industry was originally the most important, with as many as 5,500,000 spindles before the war. As for the export of raw silk, it has always occupied an important position in Italy's foreign trade figures. Among all textile industries, the silk industry is the most widely distributed, because the raw materials for cotton yarn and wool all need to be imported from abroad, while cocoon production is spread throughout the country. At least 600,000 households in the population are engaged in silkworm farming in addition to farming. At present, the government is vigorously encouraging it in order to make up for the import of cotton yarn and wool. The 1946 cocoon production is estimated to reach 40 million pounds, compared to 60 million pounds in 1939 and approximately 100 million pounds between 1919 and 1929. There are currently 200 silk factories, with the manufacturing center in Como.</p>

<p>The rice market situation is gradually getting back on track and people's confidence is very stable. The goods in each shop are gradually reduced, and the rice stores' absorption is weak. The total number of customer and goods registrations in the North and South markets yesterday was 7,374 shi and 40 bags. In order to make the industry thoroughly understand the mission of the Market Management Committee and to eliminate black market transactions, the Market Management Committee posted a notice yesterday stating: "All industry transactions should be conducted in the North and South markets as centralized trading venues, and no illegal transactions are allowed outside the venues. All market prices should follow the price determined by the Rice and Grain Review Committee as the standard and must not be exceeded. If any of the above situations occur, anyone can report it at any time." At the same time, the Rice and Grain Price Review Committee has established contact with Suzhou and Wuxi to understand the rice prices in various rice producing areas. They can obtain market price information from the producing areas at noon every day. Therefore, in the future, the review of rice prices will be based on the purchase price in the producing areas.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Taiwan Sugar Priced at 80,000 Yuan Per Dan; Market Price Sells for 94,500 Yuan; Future Allotment Prices Expected to Gradually Decrease <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's sixth allotment of sugar followed the regulations of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, allotting 15,330 bags of medium-grade sugar to the Sugar Industry Association at a price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan (approximately 50 kg). In addition, 1,030 bags of medium-grade sugar were directly allotted to candy factories and consumer cooperatives.</p>
<p>It is reported that a total of 225 sugar merchants applied to purchase sugar in the sixth allotment, requesting a total quantity of 50,800 bags. However, the stipulated allotment quantity for the sixth period was 15,000 bags. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau negotiated a solution: all applicants requesting 50 bags would receive their full allotment. Those applying for between 50 and 100 bags would be allotted 60 bags. Those applying for between 100 and 200 bags would be allotted 70 bags. For each additional 100 bags requested, 10 bags would be added to the allotment. The intention is to discourage sugar merchants from arbitrarily inflating their application quantities and to encourage them to accurately report their actual sales volume in future applications. Furthermore, it is estimated that allotting 15,000 bags of sugar per week is sufficient to meet normal demand. It is said that 70% of this allotment is transported and sold to other cities. The current sugar inventory is approximately 90,000 bags, enough for six weeks of allotments. A large shipment of Taiwan sugar is expected to arrive in Shanghai successively within these six weeks to replenish the supply.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau recently convened a meeting with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Sugar Industry Association. It was stipulated that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation would allot 15,000 bags of sugar to the Sugar Industry Association every Tuesday. Yesterday was the sixth allotment, with a marked price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan. Sugar merchants are not allowed to resell to sugar stores for more than 86,000 yuan per shi dan; the Municipal Government will strictly crack down on any violations. When the seventh allotment takes place next Tuesday, the marked price will be reduced to 75,000 yuan per shi dan. Subsequently, the sugar price will be gradually lowered with each weekly allotment, with the aim of restoring normal sugar prices. However, yesterday's market price still hovered around 94,500 yuan per shi dan. According to those familiar with the sugar industry, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's low price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan allotted to sugar merchants already provides them with a profit of 9.9% per bag, as well as an excess of two jin of sugar, totaling a fixed profit of 3,040 yuan. If sold at the stipulated price of 86,000 yuan per shi dan, sugar merchants would profit 9,040 yuan per shi dan. Therefore, at yesterday's market price of 94,500 yuan per shi dan, the profits for sugar merchants are indeed considerable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the sugar market initially fell on the news that the Taiwan Corporation was resuming sales of medium-grade sugar, causing panic. However, the market rebounded as the company's supply was limited. Consequently, local sugar merchants mostly remained on the sidelines. The Association marked the price at 92,000 yuan, but it quickly broke the 90,000 yuan barrier and fell to 88,000 yuan. The morning close was at 90,500 yuan. In the afternoon, for the aforementioned reasons, it returned to 93,500 yuan, 94,500 yuan. Sugar stores were selling at a discount of 2-3,000 yuan. However, sugar stores had no intention to sell due to cost concerns, fearing losses at a price of 80,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Lingering Heat in Guangdong <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 5th</p>
<p>After fighting for eight years, everything has changed a bit! Who would have thought? Even the seasons are a bit different. This year, the southern region is unusually hot, especially early. In recent days, heatwaves have fiercely struck Guangzhou, suffocating people. Since June 21st, the average daily death toll from heatstroke has been over fifty people. Livestock are also suffering from epidemics. Such extraordinary heat, especially so early, is said to be unprecedented in Guangzhou for years.</p>
<p>"Quenching Thirst" is Paramount</p>
<p>"Cholera" is Secondary</p>
<p>Due to the continuous extreme heat, people are seeking ways to cool down and relieve the heat, adding a new dimension to Guangzhou's landscape. Although ice shops are springing up like mushrooms after rain, increasing daily, they are mostly packed, unable to keep up with demand. Residents prioritize quenching their thirst; "cholera" is a secondary concern. Ice and soda factories are selling almost everything they produce, with prices tripling, yet still unable to meet demand. Lychee Bay and the Pearl River waterfront are popular summer retreats, teeming with visitors every evening. Swimming pools are even more crowded. Whether in the western suburbs or on Shamian Island, swimming pools are packed all day, a truly unprecedented scene. Therefore, many speculators are planning to open swimming pools recently. It is said that someone is preparing to invest 10 million yuan to open a giant amusement park called "Cape Red Mansion" on the shore of Lychee Bay, which will feature a swimming pool, dance hall, bar, hotel, ice rink, billiards room, music tea house, and other facilities, truly offering everything. If this amusement park opens, Guangzhou residents will surely find what they seek!</p>
<p>The Food Crisis Appears to Have Been Safely Overcome</p>
<p>In the past half month, food prices have been relatively stable. The food crisis seems to have been safely overcome; currently, food prices in various counties of Guangdong province have gradually decreased.</p>
<p>According to the most recent survey report, the province's 30 million people require approximately 60 million shi dan of food for half a year. Guangdong province has a total cultivated area of 39,989,896 mu, and the early rice crop should yield over 69 million shi dan. However, this year, the early rice crop suffered from irregular rainfall, and it is estimated that the harvest will only be 55% of normal, resulting in a shortage of over 22.2 million shi dan for the early crop. Guangzhou city is estimated to be short of over 5 million dan. This estimated food shortage figure is quite considerable. However, solutions are being implemented. For example, 300,000 shi of rice from Fujian, 100,000 shi from Jiangxi, and 10,000 shi from Zhejiang are being continuously transported to Guangdong for relief. Of course, inter-provincial transportation faces considerable difficulties, and the aid may not be able to address immediate needs. However, many overseas Chinese are donating rice to their homeland for relief, which is being continuously transported. For example, the fifth batch of 4,172 tons of loose rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam recently arrived in Hong Kong. It is said that this batch of rice will be distributed with 200 tons going to Xiamen, 2,500 tons to Guangzhou and Qiongyai, and 1,492 tons to Chaozhou and Meizhou, which can be said to be good news for the people of Guangdong!</p>
<p>The Fate of Siamese Rice Remains Unclear</p>
<p>Batches of loose rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam are being continuously transported, but the mystery of the previous sale of Siamese rice in Hong Kong has yet to be revealed. The Municipal Assembly, representing public opinion, is constantly demanding that the Good Relief Branch account for the relief funds, but the accounting is consistently unclear.</p>
<p>At the Municipal Assembly's regular meeting on June 21st, Director Ling of the Good Relief Guangdong Branch was originally invited to report, but Director Ling did not attend that day, sending a representative who could not answer many questions, which made the assembly members very unhappy. Therefore, it was decided to invite Director Ling to personally report at their regular meeting on the 26th. At the designated time, Director Ling finally arrived! The assembly members first brought up Director Ling's statements to reporters in Shanghai, asking him to explain. He only said that the statements did not match the original publication and that he had sent a letter requesting a correction. At the same time, he acknowledged that there were errors in his letter to Mr. Jin Cai, signing his name, published in the Ta Kung Pao, which were due to temporary negligence, and Director Ling apologized. This issue was thus provisionally concluded. However, regarding relief issues, the assembly members asked questions like machine guns. Some of these have been answered, and some require written responses. There are these questions: What is the total amount of special funds received by the province? How much is allocated to Guangzhou? What are the allocation standards? What is the total amount of losses from delayed materials? The numbers published by the branch do not match the records of the Public Works Bureau. What is the reason? The Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway lost over 130 million yuan due to the flour issue. What is the reason?</p>
<p>During the meeting, Assembly Member Zhu Keqin loudly asked, "Why is only 65% of the loose rice distributed to groups? Where did the remaining 35% go? Only people who have lost all conscience could commit such fraudulent acts!" Director Ling's face turned red, and he could only say, "I have not heard of this matter. Is there any evidence?" Assembly Member Zhu replied, "This is an ironclad fact!" When Director Ling left the meeting, Assembly Member Zhu repeated this statement, "Please pay attention to my words. This is an ironclad fact!" Director Ling simply nodded and left.</p>
<p>Communist Troops Retreat North; Pacification Work Begins</p>
<p>The security situation in Guangdong province has improved relatively, but scattered gangs of bandits in the Dongjiang area still harass the region and harm merchants and travelers from time to time. In the past, it was very difficult for the authorities to carry out pacification work because the armed personnel of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had not withdrawn. However, the CCP's armed personnel in Guangdong have now boarded ships to retreat north. Furthermore, the leader of the CCP's Dongjiang Column, Zeng Sheng, has acknowledged that there are no CCP armed forces left in Guangdong province. At the same time, the CCP recently provided assurances to the Guangzhou camp through Colonel Miller, the American representative of the eighth group: (1) As of June 20th, there are no so-called CCP armed personnel in the area north of the Dapeng Peninsula. The CCP cannot recognize other bandits posing under false pretenses. (2) The CCP guarantees that it will abide by its promises in the future and will no longer engage in armed struggle in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are currently no CCP armed personnel in Guangdong province, and any that exist are imposters. Therefore, the military authorities here have launched a comprehensive pacification plan to completely eliminate bandits everywhere within three months. The military measures being implemented are as follows: (1) Re-assigning tasks to the national army and provincial defense security teams throughout the province. (2) Rapidly organizing people's self-defense forces and implementing self-defense and security. Firearms for the self-defense forces of each county will be issued uniformly by the province. (3) Implementing joint suppression and mutual protection plans, holding regional security meetings in various districts.</p>
<p>The meeting for the Beijiang district was held on June 25th, and the pacification meeting for the Guangdong-Jiangxi border area was convened on July 1st. General Zhang Fakui, the Director of the Xingying (military headquarters), and over a hundred officers and soldiers from the Security Deputy Commander's Office personally went to Dongjiang on June 24th to preside over the pacification meetings in the Beijiang district and the Guangdong-Jiangxi district, and to inspect the defense of the northeast Dongjiang area. Hopefully, the security situation in Guangdong will no longer be a problem in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Melancholy of Guilin <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch from this Newspaper, 3rd</p>
<p>Depressing midsummer, bleak days, a chillingly desolate ruined city. Annoying wind and rain obscure the sunlight, mountains and rivers, and even the plains are covered with an unfathomable white fog, which extends into people's hearts, so melancholic, so stifling. The inexplicably changing climate has become too bizarre. However, what has changed is more than just the weather?</p>
<p>Hypocritical democracy is like a bright poisonous mushroom growing in a pile of manure. Many people exert tremendous effort, vying to pick one and hang it on the lapel of their long gown or mandarin jacket. Democracy! Why isn't the product of manure fragrant?</p>
<p>The Speaker's Dispute Becomes an Unprecedented Farce</p>
<p>The difficult-to-birth Provincial Assembly continues to be difficult to birth. The dispute over the speaker has created an unprecedented farce. When appealing to the Ministry of Interior for a decision, the two sides (Li Renren, representing the official language faction, and Chen Xizhang, representing the vernacular faction) suddenly held another "consultative meeting," hoping to resolve the speaker's issue through discussion. The result? Finally, "no result" and another unhappy ending. The reason for holding the "consultation" meeting, to put it bluntly, is "there is a reason for everything," somewhat resembling the effect of "pressure." To trace back to the origin would be a long story, too difficult for the word "democracy." Because there is no leader, the assembly has acquired a new, unheard-of name. Because there is no speaker, there is a "Chairman's Meeting," where a council member from each administrative district takes turns acting as chairman. Because the assembly has not been established, the preparatory meeting has changed to a "talk meeting." After the first plenary meeting without a speaker, the many gentlemen realized that many issues could not be resolved in such a meeting. Therefore, they adjourned for two days, rushing to resolve the speaker's issue. The result is "as stated above."</p>
<p>First Meeting Firmly Rejects Reporters' Attendance</p>
<p>Also, there was an event that was both laughable and not laughable at the first meeting. The assembly abruptly rejected reporters' attendance. What was the reason? Please don't laugh: the reason was, "This meeting is discussing internal issues. We fear that the debate will be fierce, leading to blushing faces, which would be unsightly for everyone. Therefore, we temporarily ask the reporters to leave."</p>
<p>The political melancholy, the immaturity of democracy, growing in today's China, no one can blame anyone. To get better, it probably won't get better quickly. Arguing and quarreling, without court proceedings, is already considered a sign of harmony. Ordinary people who understand the situation will understand without saying anything.</p>
<p>The people of Guilin seem to have little interest in the ups and downs of political turmoil or the many incomprehensible disputes. Too much trouble has made them cold as ice to such things. Those with some money are busy planning how to rebuild their homes, without time to care about external affairs. Those without money must get up in the middle of the night and rush to the grain distribution center on Guixi Road to queue up to buy subsidized rice (the price of rice has risen to over 60,000 or 70,000 yuan amid the gentlemen's quarrels). Refugees frown at the notices posted on the streets saying "Repatriation of Refugees, Ends at the End of June." Everyone is in chaos, and they have no leisure to listen to any resolutions, which are definitely not as popular as the news of a few tons of relief flour arriving in Guilin.</p>
<p>Mountain Torrents Erupt, Washing Away Roads and Bridges</p>
<p>Not only political issues are causing melancholy, but also transportation problems, which seem to be fueling the unease in people's hearts. Continuous heavy rains cause mountain torrents to erupt and wash away roads, which then need to be repaired. While repairs should be underway, a dispute arises between national and provincial roads. When the Guangxi Provincial Highway Bureau was about to send workers to repair the ferry crossings, road surfaces, and bridges, the Third District Administration of the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau intervened, saying that this was the Third District Administration's project and that the Provincial Highway Bureau should not interfere, refusing the Provincial Highway Bureau to carry out repairs. As a result, two monks had no water to drink, and all ferry crossings stopped work. The only ones suffering were the rows of cars stranded at the ferry crossings. You can't cross, I can't cross, and the drivers stare blankly at the river. Dispute! Dispute! Dispute! When will the dispute end? Grain transport is cut off in the dispute, and travelers sell all their luggage in the dispute. The entire lifeblood of Guangxi is thus hardened by the dispute! If there weren't news of the "Liuzhou-Guilin-Xiyi Railway opening to traffic in October" to comfort people, it would be too infuriating.</p>
<p>A Major Murder Case to Be Publicly Tried Soon</p>
<p>In the melancholic atmosphere, the only somewhat stimulating thing is a major murder case that is about to be publicly tried. The main culprits are Ni Zhongtao, who served as the "Inspector Commissioner" and "Security Commander" of the "Second Administrative District" during the occupation of Guiliu, and Guo Yongzhang, the "Deputy Commander of the Liuzhou District Militia." The person wrongly killed was He Wenyun, the magistrate of Luocheng County. He Wenyun was a well-known magistrate in the Guibei area during the war against the enemy, but Ni Zhongtao shot him for the unfounded reason that he wanted to concurrently hold the position of Luocheng County magistrate. Naturally, the people were outraged and unanimously called for the strict punishment of this confused commissioner. After the liberation of Guiliu, Ni Zhongtao was immediately detained, and the Guilin District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public lawsuit. Because the case involved significant issues, it was decided to specially organize a collegiate panel for trial, scheduled to open next week. It is indeed rare in Guangxi for a commissioner to arbitrarily kill a magistrate and end up in prison. Being able to punish a commissioner does indeed involve unspeakable twists and turns.</p>
<p>A Public Case Involves Ouyang Yuqian</p>
<p>In recent days, there has also been a public case in Guilin involving a playwright. This playwright is named Ouyang Yuqian. Because the military morale items handled by Mr. Ouyang before the evacuation of Guilin were somewhat unclear, people are digging up old cases and questioning "Where did the military morale items go?" in the newspapers. Mr. Ouyang was very unhappy and replied, "The military morale items have all been distributed to the various units of the Guilin garrison. There is evidence to prove it." However, "the person in charge of the receipts is scattered in various places," so he still needs to "send letters to collect them and publish them to the public." Finally, he said that he was about to leave, but because of a foot ailment, he "has not yet left." It is strange that cultural figures residing in Guilin do not have a good impression on the local people. For example, after the Zhang Xinfu incident, Mr. Mu Mutian actually said everywhere that "Zhang Xinfu was assassinated by Kuomintang agents." This kind of argument is really headache-inducing. It is admirable that cultural figures love democracy, but it is inevitable that they will offend the public if they speak carelessly.</p>
<p>Putting down my pen and looking out the window, I see a refugee as thin as dried bamboo sitting on the grass, frowning, lowering his head, and tightening the belt on his stomach one degree at a time, until his stomach is as small as a bowl. Then, he struggles to pick up his bamboo cane and walks towards the road in the rain. Ah, this melancholic city of Guilin!</p>

<p>Radar devices, which were used by the Navy during the war, have now become important instruments to assist in transportation. With the guidance of radar, ships have overcome many obstacles and eliminated many dangers. Recently, the steamship "Lee H. Richmond" sailed from Baltimore, Maryland, to Norfolk, Virginia, a 185-mile nighttime voyage, relying entirely on radar guidance, which proves the importance of radar for navigation.</p>
<p>The radar device consists of two parts: a rotating radar antenna on top of the wheelhouse and a receiver-indicator on the bridge. This device can display images of ships and coastal obstacles within a range of 100 yards to 32 miles.</p>
<p>During the ship's trial run, the cathode ray tube displayed images of ships anchored in the ocean and coastal scenery. Even in dense fog, clear images could be displayed. Other objects, such as buoys and small islands in the sea, could also be seen clearly.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Relief for Flood Victims and Refugees in Jiangsu Province; 50 Tons of Locusts Eradicated; "China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Distributes Flour for Work Relief <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Since its official establishment on January 16th of this year, the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRA) Jiangsu Branch has actively promoted civil engineering projects such as the Ling River road repair and dike construction, using work-for-relief methods. As of the end of this month, the branch has completed the earthen dike project on the southern Jiangsu seacoast, the dredging project of the Zhenwu Canal, the three Bama engineering project of the Jiangbei Canal returning to the Yangtze River, small-scale river dredging and dike construction projects in more than ten counties including Zhenjiang, Wujin, and Jiangyin, the Five Rivers and Six Dikes project in Huaian and Guanyun in the Communist-controlled area, and other scattered work-relief projects in various places. According to reporters, as of the end of this month, a total of 700,000 workdays of disaster-stricken laborers and refugees in the province have been mobilized, completing 850,000 cubic meters of earthwork, dredging more than 20,000 meters of the Xuzhou sewer system, and completing two water-blocking dams in the Jiangbei Canal, benefiting the local area and providing relief to disaster victims, with widespread effects. Since the busy farming season is approaching, and disaster-stricken laborers and refugees can participate in rural work, this first phase of work-relief projects will soon end. Employees will be reassigned to use this busy farming period to conduct design testing of various water conservancy projects, so that the branch can greatly improve water conservancy roads in the region after the autumn, laying the foundation for post-disaster relief efforts. The branch also reports that locust plagues are severe this year in Nanjing, Baguazhou, Jurong, Jiangpu, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Piaoshui. Since April, thousands of disaster-stricken laborers and refugees in various places have been mobilized to dig up eggs and catch nymphs, and flour is issued based on weight for work-relief. As of the end of June, more than 50 tons of jumping nymphs and more than 2,000 jin of locust eggs have been eradicated. In Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other places, the work of controlling rice borers has been launched, and demonstration areas for drug prevention and control have been designated. Various Baohan Borer Associations have been organized to actively promote work-relief borer control work. Recently, in the demonstration areas of Wuxi and Suzhou, a large amount of DDT powder, totaling three and a half tons, has been distributed in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Educational Institute, covering more than 1,600 mu of rice seedling fields, with remarkable results. Many people have gone to visit and observe. It is said that several reporters from the Associated Press and Mr. Geling, the chief agricultural expert stationed in China by the United Nations, have also gone to investigate and observe, and added instructions, believing that the results are satisfactory.

<p>(Today's China is no longer the fragile "China" of old, so no country can use the arrogant and conceited attitude of 1900 to look down on China again. To still view today's China in this way only proves one's own lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>Those who have observed and studied the outbreak of this great war and its tortuous rise and fall will know that the Axis powers failed entirely because they encountered China's strong and heroic long-term resistance from the beginning of their aggression, just as a great thief is captured or a mighty lion is caught because it suffers a fatal wound at the start. In essence, the victory of the anti-Axis nations came from the strong and heroic long-term resistance of China.</p>
<p>If on November 20, 1937, when Nanjing fell, our highest authorities had not resolved to resist, we would not bear to imagine the Japanese Rising Sun flag flying over the entirety of China today. What we would even less bear to imagine is that today's Siberia would probably have already become a "recreation area" for the Japanese Kwantung Army. People often praise the beauty and magnificence of the Empire State Building's top, but they should also remember the underlying structures that support it and bear the heavy load. Today, the European powers are at the top, and China is the underlying structure.</p>
<p>Whether today's China is a girl who takes advantage of and manipulates the conflicts and contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union to gain a large amount of happiness and profit, or a country that suffers losses and misfortunes due to the opposition and hostility between the United States and the Soviet Union, we believe that today's China should act as a sincere mediator, not a pitiful scapegoat.</p>
<p>Molotov is one of the most outstanding diplomatic figures in the international community. He should remember the sympathy and friendship that China's chief representative, President Soong Tzu-wen, gave him during the tense atmosphere of the "rotating chairmanship" system proposal and vote at the San Francisco Conference.</p>
<p>Molotov should know that the establishment and consolidation of China's position as one of the four great powers did not come from the Paris Conference under today's swords and shadows, but had already been settled in the performances at the Tehran and Yalta conferences. Therefore, if Molotov wants to deny China's qualification as an inviting nation, that is, to deny China's qualification as "one of the four great powers," he should have raised it during the Cairo, Tehran, London, San Francisco, and other conferences.</p>
<p>The situation inside China's opaque window today will not exist and linger in China forever. The state of civil war and internal strife today is like the darkness before dawn, like an arrow of time approaching. People should know that the moon thinking in stillness will appear in the cloudy and foggy sky in the morning. Just like the solar eclipse, the sun will still shine upon the earth. Therefore, people abroad should not use the current opaque national conditions of China as a reason or basis to look down on China.</p>
<p>Molotov's proposal will not only discard all the friendship of the past twenty years since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, but also make the five hundred million people of China feel infinitely disappointed in their earnest expectations of the Soviet Union, and will cause deep pain to conscientious citizens of various small and weak nations around the world. Today, the Soviet Union seems to want to change its compassionate life preserver into a rope to drown people.</p>
<p>A history of the modern world and European diplomacy is not lacking in examples of self-deception. When the protagonist of the future Third World War, "Hitler II," performs his pathetic "setting sun over a lonely city" scene, he will remember the value and preciousness of China's friendship and assistance today. There is a Western saying: "If you don't make small repairs, you will have to make big repairs." The time for Molotov to make small repairs to China's friendship and diplomatic relations is today. It must be known that only the mainstream of history can stir up the waves of human justice, and the obstacles created by the times will always be destroyed by these waves. Here, we sincerely wish that our unwise neighbor today can become our wise friend tomorrow. (Dai Meiling)</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a military policeman who has served for more than six years and is now being discharged. Sir, although we did not personally fight on the front lines during the War of Resistance, our work in suppressing bandits, maintaining security, and maintaining military discipline never stopped. Although we have no achievements, we should have some hard work, right?</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, we endured any pain. We only wanted national victory. What is a little material pain? The country was indeed victorious, but we, this group of military police who overcame thousands of hardships, were discharged.</p>
<p>Discharge is understandable because it is the beginning of demobilization. We have no complaints. But it is very painful that when we leave, even our clothes are taken away. We are not allowed to wear a single set, let alone money.</p>
<p>We only have a few thousand dollars a month. How can we afford civilian clothes? If our clothes are taken away, aren't we going to be naked? Later, after repeated requests, we were allowed to wear a set of torn military uniforms and a set of torn shirts. Sir, tell me, isn't that heartbreaking?</p>
<p>Sir, please publish this letter so that the officers can see it and show some compassion to the comrades who have been discharged but have not yet left! (A Discharged Military Policeman)</p>

<p>Editor: Is the exorbitant profit of state-run yarn factories for enriching the national treasury? Is the exorbitant profit of privately-run yarn factories also for enriching the national treasury? This is the first thing I don't understand. Silk is a major product and the only source of foreign exchange, but silk factories are allowed to go bankrupt. Although the government subsidizes one million yuan per dan, it is still below cost. Why not reduce the exorbitant profits of private yarn factories to subsidize the losses of silk factories? This is the second thing I don't understand. Prices are so high, and the scope of transactions is terribly large, but the 0.15% business tax is universally evaded. Probably the current industrial and commercial sectors only declare a few percent or a few tenths of a percent. Why is the tax authority turning a blind eye? Is it corruption? Is the treasury so flush? This is the third thing I don't understand. Large businesses issue invoices for tens of thousands of yuan, and small businesses issue invoices for thousands of yuan. The stamp tax should be considerable, but I have never seen the authorities sell stamp tax tickets with a face value of more than ten thousand yuan. It is always limited to four hundred yuan. How can we affix them? Are we teaching people to evade taxes? Is it okay to underpay? Is the cost of paper and printing not worth the money? This is the fourth thing I don't understand. Given all of this, the country is poor and the treasury is empty, and the economy is in danger. Why doesn't the authority think of some ready-made solutions? (Reader Cui Zi'an)</p>

<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, my home in northern Jiangsu was occupied by the Communist army. They implemented a policy of terror. Anyone with prestige, assets, knowledge, or a profession is in danger of being killed or having their property confiscated at any time. As a result, farmers cannot farm, workers cannot work, merchants cannot trade, and students cannot study. The people are destitute and wander to other places, looking like homeless dogs. More than three million refugees have wandered to various parts of southern Jiangsu. During the day, they beg to make a meager living, and at night, they sleep on the streets without clothes or food. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness! Now, thanks to the government and the enthusiasm of all sectors, generous donations have been made to help the refugees from northern Jiangsu. Yesterday, the registration procedure was held at the Tianchan Theater. I participated with my relatives and friends. On that day, thousands of refugees lined up in a queue. Working comrades held chalk and wrote down numbers to register in order and obtain receipts. Then, they went back on their own. I said that the relief is just a drop in the bucket and not a fundamental solution. The refugees from northern Jiangsu originally had professions. Wandering in other places is not a long-term solution. Therefore, I hope that the government and all people will quickly devise a way to return to their hometowns and resume their livelihoods. This is the best policy. (Elementary School Student Shao Anlai)</p>
<h3 id="e148">Governesses and Rickshaw Pullers Should Have Price Limits <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Editor: The difficulty of living in Shanghai is well known to everyone. Even the cost of hiring a servant has increased. I think many people must be feeling a headache. I must specifically bring it up and ask everyone to pay attention to improvement.</p>
<p>(1) Governesses: Most of the people living in Shanghai who are boarders hire one or two governesses. Most of these governesses are introduced by employment agencies. Since last winter, a group of wealthy old men and tycoons have hired governesses regardless of the situation. No matter how high the wages are, they are not afraid. As a result, the wages that were only 500 or 600 yuan in early spring this year jumped to 2,000 yuan, then to 5,000 yuan, then to 10,000 yuan, and recently even to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for the employment agencies, they charge the employer a commission of three months' salary. For example, if a governess is hired for a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan, they must pay a commission of 90,000 yuan. For 50,000 yuan, they must pay 150,000 yuan. The employment period is only one month. If the governess does not continue to work after the expiration date, the employment agency is not responsible. If you hire another one, you have to pay another commission. As a result, a huge problem has arisen, that is, the employment agencies often collude with many governesses. After agreeing on the conditions with the employer, they immediately start working. After working for one month, they quit for some reason. The commission obtained by the employment agency is split between the two. Many families have been harmed. Readers, under this situation, how can you hire a governess? The Social Affairs Bureau should have a method of banning the employment agencies. We must not allow this scam to exist and harm the people.</p>
<p>(2) Private Rickshaw Pullers: For the sake of commuting to work, it is necessary to have a rickshaw, which is more economical than hiring one. Unexpectedly, a group of private rickshaw pullers have an unusually dark heart. Since this year, the monthly wages have increased from 10,000 yuan to 50,000 or 80,000 yuan. Board and lodging are provided by the employer. Still, they feel it is too little. Recently, I heard that some are even demanding an increase to more than 100,000 yuan, which is really shocking. I am specifically raising this issue. How much is the monthly salary of public employees hired by the state? How much is the monthly pay of the national defense soldiers who protect the country and defend the people? No wonder it is not as high as the income of private rickshaw pullers! If this continues, everyone will want to be a private rickshaw puller, which is ridiculous! It should also be stipulated by the social government that the monthly wages of private rickshaw pullers should not exceed a certain amount of yuan, and this can also prevent farmers from the countryside from coming to the city and changing their profession to rickshaw pullers, which is beneficial to agricultural production.

<p>Editor: The western part of Shanghai is full of factories and a densely populated area for the poor. The nearby shallow beaches are silted up, and the stench is nauseating. Especially near our factory, on the sides of the intersection of Pinlang Road and Hede Road, residents casually pile up garbage and filth on the roadside. Pedestrians cover their noses. In this hot summer, there is an epidemic. It is very detrimental to hygiene. If no action is taken to ban it and find a way to remove it, it will harm the health of the residents. I am writing this letter to ask the health authorities to pay attention. I beg you to disclose it. (Wei Hongqing)</p>

<p>(1) Xu Linxiang from Nantong asks: I have long admired your newspaper for its untiring efforts to serve its readers! I am very impressed! Now there is a question that I would like to ask you to investigate and answer: (1) Is the raw starch mentioned in the dried goods section the same as sweet potato starch or mung bean starch? (2) Where is the market for buying large quantities of mung bean starch? Please also inquire about its source (i.e., place of origin).</p>
<p>[Reply from the Commercial News Editor of this Newspaper] Raw starch is produced in Singapore and other places and is similar to arrowhead starch. In addition to being used for food, it can also be used for sizing cloth. All seafood and foreign goods stores on Foreign Firm Street in this city sell it. Mung bean starch is a raw material for making bean starch noodles and is obtained from Zhenjiang and other places.</p>
<p>(2) Gu Zhiqi asks: Editor, I currently have some shares of the Commercial Press that I want to sell urgently. However, according to reports, only a few popular stocks are traded frequently, and the price of paper stocks is sometimes not listed at all. Although I have tried to find out in many ways, I have not been able to find anything. I want to go to school next semester, but I am in financial straits and have no support from home. Out of desperation, I implore your newspaper to point me in the right direction so that I can get financial help and focus on my studies.</p>
<p>[Reply from the Commercial News Editor of this Newspaper] Shares of the Commercial Press are traded every day and can be bought and sold through securities firms.</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Xiaojie from Zhenjiang asks: A reader was introduced by a friend and plans to work in Taiwan, but he lacks travel experience and is unfamiliar with the route. Now I have three questions. I pray that you will answer them in the newspaper: (1) Do I need a certificate or passport? (2) What is the weight limit for luggage? (3) What is the price of a boat ticket and a plane ticket?</p>
<p>[Editor's Reply] For information on travel to Taiwan and procedures, you can consult the Taiwan Provincial Government's Shanghai Liaison Office (4th floor of China Merchants Bureau, 5 Ma Road, Bund) in Shanghai. Please bring all your documents with you. All senior personnel with visas can take the plane for free, while junior and middle-level personnel wait for a boat. If you have relatives and friends in Shanghai to stay with, you can save a lot of travel expenses. It is hot in Taiwan, so it is best to bring as little luggage as possible.</p>

<p>Social Needs Are Urgent and Awaiting Assistance</p>
<p>Dear Sir: I deeply agree with the Qinxia Elderly and the Jialin Student Loan Fund's entrustment of your newspaper to handle the Orphan and Widow Relief Fund. I am sending a check for 500,000 yuan and hope that it will be used for the case. Sincerely, Jin Deqi.</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] This column, entrusted by the Qinxia Elderly, has already approved the subsidy for two batches of eight people to relieve orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. Recently, the number of applicants has increased day by day, which shows that in a large city like Shanghai, there are many people who are helpless and have no one to turn to. This column believes that this relief is very urgent and has profound significance. It is necessary to expand fundraising due to the limited funds. Yesterday, a person named "Jin De" sympathized with this relief cause and sent a staff member to donate 500,000 yuan. This gentleman also did not want to reveal his real name, but said, "Doing good does not require fame." His kindness is admirable.</p>

<p>Ticket Seller Picks Up Money to Help the Needy. A ticket seller from the Municipal Electronics Company No. 1041 picked up 60,000 yuan in cash while working on bus No. 2 at 3:00 pm on June 30th. Because he was unable to find the owner after repeated searches, he specifically transferred the money to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association yesterday to serve as the education and care expenses for refugee children. The association issued receipt No. 18611 to confirm this. The ticket seller's integrity is commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Where Is Chinese Painting Heading? <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yingyuan</p>
<p>In recent years, the chaos in the Chinese painting world has been simply overwhelming and confusing. Because the essence of the Song and Yuan dynasties cannot be continued, and an orthodox painting school has not been established, the large-scale absorption of Western painting has caused the instability of traditional Chinese painting. These are all preludes to the new development of academics, which is naturally exciting. But it is a pity that the Western painting and Chinese painting schools are too deeply divided, and they are mutually hostile. In the art school, due to the different theoretical schools, there is alienation between professors and professors, and between students and students. Almost even the clothes between the departments are not pleasing to the eye. Of course, there are similar phenomena in other academics, such as the Chinese Literature Department and the Foreign Literature Department are also rarely harmonious. However, I feel that the progress of academics should be in the theoretical discussions and should not be expressed outwardly with emotion, focusing only on right and wrong between people.</p>
<p>In the current Chinese painting world, pure Chinese painting and pure Western painting are two extremes. The theoretical struggle is naturally inevitable. However, there are too many branches and schools between the two extremes. In terms of form and technique, there are those who have emerged from Western painting sketches and use Chinese painting ink, and those who have emerged from Chinese painting and have Western painting composition or have Western painting colors. When painting characters, there are those with Western anatomy, and there are also pure Western painting forms, taking Chinese painting themes and artistic conceptions. In short, they are intertwined with each other, almost indistinguishable. Each small school also holds its own opinions, scolding each other. What is the combination of Chinese and Western, what is the separation of China and Japan, what is oil canvas better than rice paper, and what is a brush stronger than a brush, what is a strong color better than a light and elegant one, and what is transcendence better, making it extremely chaotic. In fact, it should be understood that the various backgrounds and elements of the production of artworks, as well as the general trend of artistic development, can avoid external conflicts.</p>
<p>Based on the research results of human cultural evolution history, we can probably know that every time other cultures are flourishing, new art is always budding, and then it will develop brilliantly later. Few arts are in a leading position, and the trend of cultural development is determined by regional environment, historical background, philosophical thought, religious belief, political characteristics, diplomacy, internal affairs, economy, transportation, etc. When art is produced, in addition to the above elements, there are also factors such as climate and materials. Because artworks have to go through two key points: one is the psychological condition of the writer, and the other is social public decision. Artworks that violate the above conditions and factors will be naturally eliminated and decline, even if they are produced. When you create an art that is ahead of its time, society has no ability to accept it and is criticized. When you never improve, you will be abandoned by society. A few years ago, when various new schools in Europe (such as Matisse and Picasso) rose for a while, they were like flashes in the pan and immediately became traces in art history. Our country once advocated it, and as a result, those who learned Fauvism and those who learned Cubism later became Chinese painters.</p>
<p>However, when the time is not ripe, it is absolutely impossible to compromise. Forced assembly becomes an unnatural thing, that is to say, the emergence of an orthodox new school is not that simple. There must be cultural exchanges (according to Professor Xu Beihong, it is necessary to wait for a large number of Chinese and Western marriages) before the new culture gradually merges Chinese and Western art into one furnace. As far as the new Chinese painting is concerned, there will be a real new school of Chinese painting at that time. It is by no means that current painters bring a little Western painting color and composition, which is called the combination of Chinese and Western, and it is not that easy.</p>
<p>When that time comes, what kind of posture will this new school appear in? We can speculate that in terms of production materials, new tools and new materials will be discovered, in terms of materials, the scope will definitely be expanded, and the standards of themes will have to be shifted. The brushwork and brush strength may be maintained. In terms of content, it will change due to the influence of foreign new cultures, but because China has thousands of years of traditional culture, philosophical background, national character, outlook on life, etc., the artistic conception expressed will never destroy all the essence of the past, and completely take Western painting to replace it.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Ah Cui (A Novel) - Part 1 <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Six years ago, we had a young maid in our house named Ah Cui.</p>
<p>She was a seventeen-year-old country girl who, while not exactly beautiful, had a pointed oval face and was fairly well-featured. When she first came, she was probably only fifteen, wearing a short shirt and trousers of willow-patterned cloth, red foreign socks, green shoes, and two pink velvet ribbons tied on her greasy braid. With this getup, she could have certainly attended a wedding banquet in the countryside, but in the city, it was inevitably a bit out of place. I looked at her braid and couldn't help but laugh. Unexpectedly, she was very perceptive. The next morning, when she came to sweep my room, she brought a pair of scissors and a comb, and said to me with a smile:</p>
<p>"Miss, I know you laughed at my braid yesterday. In the countryside, I heard long ago that city girls all cut their hair. I argued with my mother, but she always refused to let me cut it. Now that I'm out, my mother can't control me anymore. Miss, I heard you're good at cutting hair. Thank you, please cut my braid for me, okay?"</p>
<p>"How did you know I can cut hair?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"How could I not know! Little Xiang from next door told me!" She took a few steps forward with a smile, standing in front of me and saying, "Sister Xiao Xiang said that you even cut the hair of their eldest young mistress and second young lady, and that you cut better than the barber!"</p>
<p>When I cut Ah Cui's braid, I discovered that this country girl was quite remarkable. Not only was she quick-witted, lively, and good at socializing, but she had also befriended Sister Xiao Xiang next door after only one day. When I untied her greasy braid and cut it off with two snips, a white substance appeared on the back of her neck. I rubbed it with my finger, and it was a bit sticky. I sniffed it, and sure enough, it was the newly bought "Love's Cream" that I had left downstairs by the tree!</p>
<p>Ah Cui's love of beauty seemed a bit excessive. On Sunday evenings, whenever the weather was nice and there was a moon, my mother always liked to take me and my younger brother out for a walk. I can't remember how many times I happily held my younger brother's hand and came back from outside, went upstairs, and stepped into my own room, only to be startled by Ah Cui's slyly grinning face in front of the mirror. Of the dozen or so cheongsams that I had, she had probably tried on every single one. My fleece-lined jacket, leather shoes, and even stockings, she all wanted to "taste."</p>
<p>However, I must admit that Ah Cui was a rare and good servant. She was clever, quick, and even better at reading faces and understanding situations. She arranged everything neatly before anyone even asked. Sometimes, seeing me in a bad mood, she would automatically go to Yun Fang's house next door to borrow some novels and ask me, "Miss, why don't you read a book to relieve your boredom!"</p>
<p>On Ah Cui's sixteenth birthday, my mother gave her four dollars, telling her to go to a restaurant to eat a bowl of noodles and buy whatever else she liked with the rest. She thanked us with a smile and went out, but didn't return for a long time. I guessed that she wouldn't be willing to spend the four dollars on food. She must have gone to buy some cloth, rouge, silk stockings, and other things. Unexpectedly, when she came back in the evening, her hands were empty, and she brought nothing back. I asked her if she had eaten the noodles, and she shook her head. When she opened her mouth to smile at me, a sparkling gold tooth appeared in her mouth!</p>
<p>Loving beauty is certainly not a bad thing, but Ah Cui's flaws definitely came from her love of beauty. Since the day she had the gold tooth installed, she gradually became less settled. Whenever she had a free moment, she would sneak out, and would always be gone for two or three hours. She also desperately applied face powder to her face four or five times a day, wishing she could make it as white as a wall. Fragrant soap, cold cream, and cologne were all ready. The shelf in the kitchen was almost her dressing table.</p>
<p>One day, I was walking on the street. The sun was shining brightly at first, but suddenly it started to rain. I wanted to brave the rain and rush back, but then I thought that getting soaked and catching a cold or triggering my old illness was no small matter, so I stepped onto the steps of a shop to take shelter from the rain.</p>
<p>I didn't pay attention to what kind of shop it was. I wasn't the only one taking shelter from the rain. A row of people stood in front like a screen, blocking my view. Suddenly, amidst the sound of the pouring rain, a series of sharp "giggling" sounds rang out. Surprised, I peeked between the shoulders of two old men in front of me to look across the street, only to realize that it was a dental shop. I saw a young man of about twenty standing at the door, flirting with Ah Cui...</p>
<p>I couldn't find a reason for myself, but I kept the matter a deep secret. However, it couldn't be concealed forever. One night, Ah Cui tried to sneak out through the back door after we were all asleep, but was finally discovered by my mother, who immediately went out to search for her. As a result, she found Ah Cui and the young man from the dental shop in a small inn...</p>
<p>The young man's name was Ah Shun. I heard that he was fired by his boss the next day. My mother asked someone to send a letter to Ah Cui's mother in the countryside to prevent anything else from happening.</p>
<p>Ah Cui's mother was a woman in her thirties with a pockmarked face and slanted eyes. Actually, she wasn't her mother, but her mother-in-law. Ah Cui had been taken in as a child bride. Because her son died before they could consummate the marriage, she treated Ah Cui as her own daughter. On a day when the New Year gongs and drums were beating lively, Ah Cui's mother rushed out from the countryside, bringing some brown sugar sponge cake, shredded radish cakes, and long-stemmed vegetables. As soon as she saw people, she shouted "Congratulations and get rich!"</p>
<p>That night, Ah Cui let her hair down, tears and snot streaming down her face, stamping her feet and crying:</p>
<p>"I won't go back even if I die... I won't go back even if I die..."</p>
<p>"You little slut! You dare curse on the first day of the New Year in front of the lady's door, I'll tear your mouth apart..." Ah Cui's mother's slanted eyes turned up, and after slapping her a few times, she turned around, saw me beside her, and said with some apology: "Miss! As soon as I received the lady's letter, I wanted to come out and take this little slut back, but I was too busy with the farm work to leave. I'm really sorry to disturb you at the beginning of the New Year!..."</p>
<p>The next morning, at the break of dawn, Ah Cui came to my room with a package to say goodbye, her eyelids swollen like walnuts, her throat still sobbing. When she saw me, a flood of tears rolled down again, and she sobbed for a long time, seemingly afraid to say something. After I asked her repeatedly, she said that Ah Shun lived at No. 15, Baojia Lane, West Gate, and she had no way to say goodbye to him. She wanted me to find a way to send him a message, saying that she had been forced back by her mother.</p>
<p>"Miss: Tell Ah Shun, I will never forget him even if I die... I will still come out even if I die!..." After I agreed to help her find a way, she said that while sobbing and clenching her teeth.</p>
<p>I can never forget Ah Cui's appearance that morning. She cried so much that she became a river of tears, her pointed oval face turning pale. I helped her to the door of the room and put two newly bought floral handkerchiefs into her palm and said:</p>
<p>"I'm giving you these two handkerchiefs as a souvenir. Don't be sad. A young man like Ah Shun may not be reliable. You're young, it's too late to be fooled! Your family has land, your mother is taking you back to protect you..." I hadn't finished speaking when she snatched up and said with a sob:</p>
<p>"Miss: You don't have to persuade me,... sob sob!... I've already seen through it,... land is fake, parents are fake,... apart from Ah Shun, nothing in the world is real,... I've already seen through it,... seen through it!..." She stepped out of my room, turned her head and said to me: "Miss:... please don't forget!... I have seen through it, only Ah Shun is sincere... sob..." and then went with her mother, crying.</p>
<p>After Ah Cui went back, there was no news for half a year. One day, an old country woman came from nowhere, holding a red paper package in her hand, and swaying into our courtyard, shouting loudly: "Is this the Zhang family? Miss Ah Cui asked me to send a piece of wedding cake to the lady, miss and A'guan to eat!"</p>
<p>Hearing "Ah Cui", everyone was shocked. After my mother invited the old woman to sit in the parlor, she asked:</p>
<p>"Is Ah Cui married? Who did she marry?"</p>
<p>"She married a good-natured young man,..." the old woman looked around stealthily, and said in a low voice: "There are no outsiders here, it's okay to say, Miss Ah Cui chose him herself, a young man named Lin Sheng from their neighboring village. At first, her mother refused, but later Lin Sheng asked someone to speak up several times before she agreed. They got engaged last month, and they had their wedding on the third of this month. The young couple is really in love!" The old woman said with a beaming smile.</p>
<p>The first time Ah Cui came to the city to play after her marriage was in late autumn when chrysanthemums were in full bloom. I still remember that there was a small caterpillar in the light purple chrysanthemum she had stuck in her hair. After I caught it for her, I asked her:</p>
<p>"Why did you grow your hair out again? Didn't you specifically ask me to cut it off for you?"</p>
<p>"People in the countryside all comb their hair, Lin Sheng asked me to keep it, and I wanted to keep it too, because..." she didn't go on, but looked at her belly happily and shyly. Her belly was very high. She told me that she had only been married for three months and ten days, but the child in her belly seemed to be at least six months old.</p>
<p>After lunch, Ah Cui asked me to accompany her to the street to buy some children's clothing material. Inadvertently, we passed by that dental shop again. I looked at her, seeing that she was acting as if nothing had happened and didn't look at the shop at all, so I asked her:</p>
<p>"Ah Cui, do you still remember Ah Shun?"</p>
<p>She paused slightly, but then smiled and said to me: "Miss, you have a good memory! What Ah Shun, no Ah Shun! Miss, to tell you the truth, I have seen through it, as long as the man is kind and gentle, they are all the same! Ah Shun was sincere to me, and Lin Sheng is also sincere,..." Saying this, she turned her head and smiled at me, the gold tooth still shining brightly in her mouth. However, in addition to the gold tooth, there was also something sparkling in her face, that is, her eyes. I saw that her eyes revealed joy and contentment after being immersed.</p>
<p>When Ah Cui was about to leave, she said that she would send red eggs to us when she gave birth, but she still didn't send them after a year. Some people said that her village was not peaceful, and Japanese devils came to rob and set fire to the village, and most of the villagers fled to other places.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, another year passed, and on such a gloomy afternoon, Ah Cui came again.</p>
<p>Even my younger brother felt it was a little strange, pulling my sleeve and asking repeatedly: "Why has Ah Cui become so ugly?" She seemed to be ten years older. Although she still had her hair combed back neatly into a bun, the hair had fallen out, leaving only a thin patch that was dry and yellow. Her dark blue cloth coat was still made in our place, but it had already had holes. She lowered her face, which had been tanned to a soy sauce color, looked at the package in her hand, called out "Miss..." and her eyes turned red. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>The highway is like a sugared ribbon, with countless ant-cars attached to it, crawling on it.</p>
<p>The car is like a string of ducklings coming from the upper reaches of a winding river.</p>
<p>The car travels, the car tail drags a roll of dust, humming a "put...put..." song, speeding merrily from the flat road, appearing alertly in the mountain bend, suddenly disappearing in the valley.</p>
<p>In the days of blooming flowers, the tender spring breeze scatters colorful colors across the earth. The peach blossoms along the road welcome the car with their beautiful faces; the plum blossoms and cherry blossoms all over the mountains and fields also wave to the travelers in the car with their plain-colored flower buds. The happy car window constantly shows flower branches, lining up colorful reds and purples, and the travelers have nostalgia and warm dreams.</p>
<p>Look at that grassland, that flat grassland where horses are grazing, why aren't there any people playing ball there? The simple horses must not have been to the city and have not seen the Jeeps galloping in the city. Our long, galloping, fast-moving car team is even more unfamiliar to them. They stare with surprised eyes, their ears standing straight up.</p>
<p>What distant mountains, countless arm veins, countless peaks, endless forests and deep valleys. The ribbon of the highway has no trace of people on the road, no pavilions or houses, how desolate, how rough, how lonely and scary.</p>
<p>We have reached another provincial boundary. The clear river gushes out from the distant valley, and rows of tall bamboo on both sides of the bank bend towards the river, bend towards the highway, and bend towards the tired travelers with their foxtail-like long hats.</p>
<p>I haven't seen banana trees for a long time, they are still pointing to the car with green palms, waving to the car, and those teams that seem to be palms connecting with palms, are they welcoming the car? I say remotely with comfort: "Have you been well?"</p>
<p>Still stacks of crescent-shaped paddy fields surround the mountains, reflecting clumps of mountain cypresses; still lush green broad beans and wheat seedlings with hairpins, bustling bees and butterflies are flying around and patrolling.</p>
<p>After passing around a hill, you can see the Yangtze River from afar. The clear sandy shore is lined with a long stream. White sails that sway with the wind fly to the distance. The bird sounds and water sounds in the bridge forest and longan forest on both sides echo each other. The earth is a piece of green, full and harmonious.</p>
<p>At night, I sit alone in the riverside restaurant, leaning on the fishing fire by the river, leaning on the distant people who cannot be seen.</p>
<p>Turning onto the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, what a prosperous and famous highway, but why are there so many wrinkles, so many waves? Are the road maintenance workers neglecting their duties? Have the people in charge of the road bureau forgotten? It's a pity that our car, we are bumping and uneasy, almost sinking into the road of the sea!</p>
<p>I will leave here tomorrow morning, leave the small town on the Tuojiang River. I am worried that the other city that I have been separated from for a long time is too unfamiliar. I sent a telegram before the trip, "××I will arrive at × at 15:00, I hope to wait for me at the ×× station," when I came out of the telegraph office, I saw the distant mountains and rivers were misty like mist, and I was about to walk towards the misty place again, I fell into a misty dream.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>As time went on, she attracted the attention of a female teacher. The female teacher did not know who Lihua was, but thought she was a studious child who was unable to study. Therefore, she felt sympathy for her. One day, when Lihua was about to run out again, she stopped her.</p>
<p>"Do you want to study?" the female teacher asked Lihua.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lihua replied, lowering her head and blushing.</p>
<p>"Have you ever gone to school before?" the female teacher asked again.</p>
<p>"No," Lihua shook her head and said.</p>
<p>"Give me the little notebook in your hand," the female teacher asked Lihua for her little notebook to look at, in a tone of treating a student.</p>
<p>Lihua refused, and was too shy to let her have it, hiding the little notebook behind her back. But suddenly the naughty Liyun snatched it and handed it to the female teacher. After reading it, the female teacher looked at Lihua in surprise and said:</p>
<p>"You write very well, you don't seem to have never gone to school."</p>
<p>"I used to read with my father, but I never went to school," Lihua said softly. She felt a kind of joy. Joy for the female teacher's praise!</p>
<p>"Then why don't you go to school? Where are you from? What is your family doing here?" The female teacher was like interrogating a new student.</p>
<p>Lihua was a little embarrassed by the female teacher's questions. She didn't know how to answer. At this moment, Liyun snatched the answer and said: "We are from Beijing, my sister——" Liyun had just said this when Lihua quietly pulled her, stopping her.</p>
<p>When the female teacher saw this situation, she didn't want to ask any further. She immediately took a basic book and gave it to Lihua, patting her and saying kindly:</p>
<p>"Take these books back and read them. If there is anything you don't understand, just ask me. Also, if you can understand the classes here, you can come here to audit every day, and we can waive the tuition fee."</p>
<p>"Thank you! I will definitely come to ask you for advice in the future!" Lihua said gratefully, gave a salute, and left with Liyun.</p>

<p>— Xue Hua</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth day of the fifth lunar month is my birthday. Every year when this day comes, my friend Xuefang always sends me something. This year she sent a letter from the post office, with a blank piece of letter paper and a short poem inside, written like this:</p>
<p>——The same day the year before last,</p>
<p>I sent you a bright red rose,</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as you took it,</p>
<p>A small thorn broke your finger.</p>
<p>The same day last year,</p>
<p>I sent you a beautiful handkerchief,</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as you took it,</p>
<p>You put it to your eyes to wipe away tears.</p>
<p>The same day this year,</p>
<p>I decided to change my strategy,</p>
<p>I'll send you a blank piece of white paper,</p>
<p>I wonder if you can understand what I mean?——</p>
<p>After reading this poem several times, I picked up my pen and replied to Yunfang with the following poem:</p>
<p>——I understand what you mean:</p>
<p>Life is a blank piece of white paper.</p>
<p>I understand what you mean:</p>
<p>I can paint this white paper with splendid brocade,</p>
<p>I can also smear this white paper with stains.</p>
<p>Everything is up to my free will.</p>
<p>So I understand what you mean:</p>
<p>I should be careful with my free will!</p>
<p>I should cherish this blank paper of life!</p>

<h3 id="e158">Before 1960, the Soviet Union Did Not Dare to Wage War <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Will there be a war between the United States and the Soviet Union in the near future? This is a question that the world cares about, but it seems that no one can answer. The American "Business Week" published an article by Paul Rensburg, a Dutchman, offering a bold answer to the above question. The main points are now excerpted and translated below, and those who are concerned about international politics can use it as a reference.</p>
<p>According to the Dutch opinion, the answer to this question can be seen from a series of concise figures put forward by Stalin. These figures illustrate the content of the Soviet Union's three five-year plans from now until 1960; they reveal what Stalin's purpose is.</p>
<p>Although many of the Soviet Union's five-year plans are entirely about the economy, they can also be seen as a barometer of Soviet political and military affairs. Modern warfare is ultimately built on economic strength. If factors such as morale and leadership are equal, the war is often won by the country with the largest industrial production capacity. Especially in the atomic age, a country's combat power cannot be judged solely by the number of its armed forces; the determining factor is still the function and scope of its technical system: its factories, scientists, workers, and raw materials.</p>
<p>The figures put forward by Stalin show that the Soviet Union is almost dwarfed in strength compared to the United States. Even if Stalin is determined to fight the United States, at least he can hope to do so before 1960.</p>
<p>His recent vows show that Stalin is well aware of the limits of Soviet power; the content of these speeches is more defensive than offensive. In order to ensure that the Soviet Union is not afraid of being attacked, it must be strong. At the same time, strength is a relative thing, so Stalin advocated that the first step for the Soviet industrial system should be to achieve this goal, which will take fifteen to twenty years.</p>
<p>For example, by 1960, the Soviet Union hopes to reach a steel production of 56 million tons per year, while the United States had a steel production of 80 million tons in 1945. The Soviet Union's steel production in 1940 was only 18 million tons.</p>
<p>Another sign of the Soviet Union's weakness is its limited pig iron production. Last year, the United States produced 54 million tons of pig iron, but the Soviet Union will only produce 50 million tons by 1960.</p>
<p>Oil production is another measure of a country's strength. In 1940, the Soviet Union produced 217 million barrels of oil, and by 1960, it hopes to increase this number to 420 million tons, but compared to the current production of the United States, it is only a quarter.</p>
<p>A country's industrial strength can also be judged from its transportation system. The Soviet Union's railway tracks are about 58,000 miles, many of which are single-track. The United States has more than 241,000 miles of railway tracks, more than four times that of the Soviet Union. As for roads that can be used in various climates, the Soviet Union has very few, while the United States has more than 3 million miles of main roads.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union hopes to produce 1 million cars per year by 1950, while by that time, American manufacturers can produce 6 million cars per year.</p>
<p>The purpose of this comparison is not to deny the progress of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's harvest is indeed great, but from the world's perspective, it is limited.</p>
<p>Stalin's plan particularly emphasizes four points, namely the Soviet Union's land, food, resources, and people. The Soviet Union's territory is three times larger than the United States, and although there is a temporary shortage of food, the hope of expanding agricultural production is almost unlimited. As for resources, the Soviet Union has sufficient reserves of almost every important mineral, and even if a few are insufficient, it has invented appropriate substitutes. In addition, the large population is also a factor that Stalin pays attention to.</p>
<p>Based on these points, Stalin believes that the Soviet Union can catch up with the United States, because according to Stalin's theory, American production will at most remain the same or even become depressed in the next 20 years due to the constraints of capitalism.</p>
<p>But the Soviet Union is very unwilling for the United States to experience a recession. This is not because Stalin has any preference for the United States, but for another reason. Because once the United States encounters economic difficulties, it may engage in arms production to seek a way out; this is an emergency measure to remedy the situation, and in this way, there is a danger of forcing other countries to implement an arms race.</p>
<p>Of course, the Soviet Union's leaders hope that the Soviet Union will grow, but at the same time, they also hope that the United States will not encounter difficulties and remain strong. The Soviet Union believes that the industrial equality between the United States and the Soviet Union is a plan to build a peaceful world.</p>

<h3 id="e162">"Veto" Expert Gromyko <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The "veto" issue of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council is indeed a very delicate topic. Many people think that it is enough to hinder the Security Council from taking effective action, and some think that it is a guarantee that can prevent a country's主張 from being erased by other countries. In fact, the "veto" can be regarded as a barometer of whether international cooperation is sincere. The less it is used, the more it can show that the cooperation between countries is free from question. Of course, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to abolish the "veto" for a while. We can only hope that time will dilute it and make it disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Up to now, the Soviet Union has used the "veto" the most times.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union encountered reefs in the Security Council, and it used this power. The whole world is already accustomed to this. In order to counter the majority of democratic countries, the Soviet Union used the "veto" to protect itself. But if the United Nations must bow to a minority of countries on every issue, it simply cannot work.</p>
<p>A year ago, at the San Francisco Conference, the Soviet Union finally agreed with other major powers that the use of the "veto" should be limited to taking punitive actions against countries, and should not be used for minor issues such as procedural matters. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China jointly declared: "We cannot assume that the permanent members of the Security Council will deliberately use the "veto" to obstruct its actions." But within five months, the Soviet Union used the "veto" twice to oppose resolutions for peaceful settlement, and also had the intention to use the "veto" for non-punitive issues.</p>
<p>We now list the number of times the Soviet Union has used the "veto" below:</p>
<p>(1) In January of this year, Canadian Pannier's failure to be elected as Secretary-General of the Security Council was due to the Soviet Union's opposition and the threat of using the "veto."</p>
<p>(2) In February, the Soviet Union vetoed the resolution of confidence on the withdrawal of British and French troops from Syria and Lebanon. (At present, all troops have withdrawn from Syria, and almost all troops stationed in Lebanon have also withdrawn).</p>
<p>(3) In March, Soviet representative Gromyko walked away because he could not convince other members of the Security Council that the resolution to listen to the report of Iranian Ambassador Elara was also within the scope of the "veto."</p>
<p>(4) In April, Gromyko refused to vote on the proposal to establish a subcommittee to investigate Franco Spain, with no other intention than to show that he had the "veto" in hand, although he did not use it.</p>
<p>(5) In late June, Gromyko opposed the resolution on Spain, mainly because the Soviet Union opposed submitting this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The next day, the Soviet Union insisted on maintaining the "veto" in the control of atomic energy, opposing the United States' view of abolishing it. In the United States' view, if any country has the "veto," the world cannot effectively control atomic energy, but Gromyko said, "In any case, the "veto" should be maintained."</p>
<p>The "veto" is a passive thing, not an active tool. Its appearance shows that there are still gaps between countries, and the effectiveness of the United Nations cannot be fully发挥. We might as well say: "The more times the veto is used, the farther away from the ideals of the United Nations." But if international justice can become more and more obvious, the shadow of the "veto" will be broken by the light.</p>
<h3 id="e163">How the Atomic Bomb Was Dropped <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Junmo from Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>Colonel Tibbets, who piloted the Superfortress flying at 30,000 feet and dropped the historic first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, personally narrated this dramatic and moving story.</p>
<p>At the vast airfield in Utah, B29 Superfortresses were flying at altitudes invisible to the naked eye. The secret 509th Composite Group was training there. Pilots practiced sharp turns, return flights, and precise bombing. The airmen of the 509th were trained in atomic bombing, but did not know that there was such a thing as an atomic bomb. They only heard it said: "What we learn at the Utah airfield may end the war." They believed it and obeyed the command.</p>
<p>Until August 1944, I didn't know about the atomic bomb. Then, I received a strange letter from my father from Miami, asking: "How are you doing? Some special people have come to investigate your situation. Have you done anything wrong?"</p>
<p>Less than a week later, I was summoned to see General Ant, the commander of the Second Air Force. An army intelligence officer pulled me aside and asked me a question. This was the final test of my loyalty to the motherland. I passed, and then they told me about the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Our training was completely secret. When a 509th aircraft took off, no one knew where it was going. Sometimes we dropped simulated atomic bombs in the sea, and sometimes we sent an aircraft to Japan to drop a bomb to test the accuracy of bombing.</p>
<p>By noon on August 15, everything was ready. The atomic bomb was ready, the aircraft had been fueled, and the crews had been tested. The takeoff time was set for 2:30 a.m.</p>
<p>I wanted to take a nap, but couldn't sleep. At one o'clock, we ate ham and eggs. At 1:30, three aircraft took off to Japan to scout the weather conditions over the target.</p>
<p>The atomic bomb was placed in my aircraft. My co-pilot was Bob Lewis, navigator Van Kirk, and bombardier Ferebee. Two B29s accompanied us. One tested the force of the explosion, and the other took pictures. At 2:15, we started the engines. I forgot about the atomic bomb and concentrated on checking the instruments.</p>
<p>Bob Lewis was calculating the time. Fifteen seconds, ten seconds, five seconds, ready——</p>
<p>At 2:30 a.m. sharp, the aircraft left the ground and flew to Japan, unfolding this new era of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>After climbing to a considerable altitude, I drank some coffee, turned around, and told my companions what a guy was in the bomb bay. They listened, understood, and remained calm. An atomic bomb, good.</p>
<p>At 8:15, we received the weather report from the patrol aircraft on the radio: visibility over Hiroshima was ten miles, with a slight haze. We continued to climb, and the three B29s formed a loose formation.</p>
<p>Twenty-five miles from Hiroshima, we began to use radar to control the aircraft. The altimeter was pointing at 31,600 feet, and we would drop the bomb at 9:15 according to the planned schedule.</p>
<p>Twelve miles from the target, Ferebee shouted, "I see it!"</p>
<p>He grabbed the bomb sight and took over the control stick from me. A loud warning was issued on the radio, notifying the B29s protecting us that the bomb would be dropped in two minutes. Ferebee nodded to me, everything was fine. He made a gesture to the radio operator, and a continuous sound was emitted on the radio, telling each aircraft, "Bomb release in fifteen seconds."</p>
<p>The sound on the radio stopped, and the bomb was released. Ferebee left the bomb sight. I released the autopilot and turned the aircraft sharply.</p>
<p>I pulled up the welding glass. Suddenly, I couldn't see anything, I was completely blind. I dropped my glasses on the ground.</p>
<p>A dazzling light filled the aircraft, and the first violent blast wave hit us. We were already eleven and a half miles away from the explosion site, but the entire aircraft was shaking violently. I shouted, thinking that the aircraft had been hit by anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>The machine gunner in the rear compartment had seen the first blast wave coming, but he didn't know what it was. When the second blast wave came, he issued a warning.</p>
<p>We turned back and looked down at Hiroshima. The entire city was in flames, and columns of fire rose to an unbelievable height. Everyone has seen these photos now.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a while, and then everyone was talking. I remember Lewis swinging my arm and saying, "Look! Look!" He said that he could taste the taste of the atomic bomb explosion on his tongue, which was the same as the taste of lead.</p>
<p>Ferebee issued a report on the way back, "The result is excellent."</p>
<p>"Hey, what do you say?" He asked me, "It's really great."</p>
<p>When we landed, we heard someone shout, "Attention!" General Spaatz stepped forward and pinned a DSC medal on my lapel.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Waiting for the Tram <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A relative told me that he recently wanted to take the No. 1 tram, which was no different from waiting for a hare to run into a tree stump. Once was on June 23rd, with wind, from 9:00 p.m. to 9:50 p.m., waiting for the eastbound No. 1 tram at the Nanjing Road Zhejiang Road station, watching several No. 2 trams pass by, but not seeing a single No. 1 tram. Once was on the 13th of this month from 4:55 p.m. to 5:25 p.m., waiting for the same No. 1 tram at the same station. The eastbound No. 2 trams reached 24, but not a single No. 1 tram was seen. Even the westbound trams, there were no less than 20 No. 2 trams, while only 2 No. 1 trams passed by in total. Another time, he saw an interesting fact. On the 14th of this month at 10:00 p.m., he passed through North Sichuan Road on his way home, and from the Changchun Road intersection south to the terminal station in front of Fuxing Middle Road, he counted as many as seven northbound No. 1 trams parked there.</p>
<p>We believe that trams are also a public utility, and the purpose is to facilitate the general public who cannot afford to prepare their own rickshaws, tricycles, or even cars. Judging from the above facts, the No. 1 tram from Jing'an Temple to the end of North Sichuan Road is really a bit of a headache for passengers.</p>
<p>Of course, we dare not believe that the tram company deliberately treats this most crowded route in the city harshly. But first, if it is said that there was wind on the night of June 23rd, the No. 2 trams were still running as usual; second, if it is said that there are not enough vehicles to distribute, so that not a single No. 1 tram departs for half an hour or fifty minutes, then how could the No. 2 trams have departed for 20 vehicles in half an hour? Third, as many as seven vehicles are parked at the terminal station at the same time. I wonder if the starting station has the same situation. Is it because the terminal station of the No. 2 tram is in public view, so it does not dare to have such a strange phenomenon of parking seven vehicles in a row?</p>
<p>Speaking of it, it is another trivial matter, but the time of the common people is also time. This article is respectfully submitted to the public utility authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Using Domestic Goods Is the Most Glorious <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>When imported goods fill every corner, our industry has to send out a cry for help for the sake of its fragile lifeblood. Everyone cannot but feel deep sympathy for the unfortunate fate that our industry is currently encountering.</p>
<p>Using one more domestic good is leaving one more vitality for ourselves.</p>
<p>Even if you put on glass clothes, and everything becomes glassized, you still cannot improve your own value and status. Always dragging behind others, using atomic something on this side, and Pol type something on that side, at best, it is just a mere echo.</p>
<p>Everyone using Chinese goods can help Chinese industry overcome difficulties and enter the bright road.</p>
<p>Many foreign goods are smuggled past our customs. But our industry, in addition to coping with high-priced raw materials and labor, also has to bear huge government taxes. This spirit is so admirable.</p>
<p>Loving to use domestic goods is by no means being xenophobic. On the contrary, we very much hope for the import of foreign goods, but what we hope to import are machines and raw materials, so that our industry can also develop day by day.</p>
<p>Admittedly, foreign goods are cheaper than domestic goods, but frugality can help you solve this problem.</p>
<p>Don't ignore it because it is small. Everyone uniting with one heart will perhaps save everyone from buying one less box of shoe polish, which is enough to open a shoe polish factory.</p>
<p>Today, foreign countries are already in the atomic age, and we are far behind. But just chasing after others, eating foreign instant noodles, foreign canned goods, foreign oranges, wearing foreign clothing, foreign suits, and using foreign cosmetics, this is still a great shame. If everyone uses their own products, even if they are crude, they are still worth glory and respect.</p>
<p>We are the victorious country, and the huge sacrifice has earned this glory. But the lessons of the past year can alert everyone, otherwise, how long this glory can be preserved is really a fiery question.</p>
<p>Everyone calmly think about it, use domestic goods or foreign goods?</p>
<p>Using domestic goods is the most glorious!</p>
<h3 id="e167">Talking About Confusion <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ke</p>
<p>"Not crazy, not family head." Some people, some things, take confusion as the best policy. "Hard to be confused," how precious is "confusion."</p>
<p>Putting everything down a little, bringing more of a "Han doesn't care" indifferent atmosphere, throughout the ages, many people have often praised the confused as having "the demeanor of a gentleman" and "the belly of a prime minister."</p>
<p>In essence, many lucky people in society are sophisticated, long-sleeved, good at dancing, and round and round characters. So soft that you can't pinch out bones, and the knee joints are especially flexible, able to bend and stretch very softly. If people are too soft, although they can gain experience, they can hide their edge, but after all, they lack a bit of backbone, a bit of a spirit that is inviolable, and gradually become "confused" due to following the old ways.</p>
<p>In China, "not being confused about big things" seems to be a brilliant virtue. But in reality, it's okay to be a little confused about small things. So foreign scientists spend their whole lives calculating, and our statistics only show a general situation. In fact, people have been doing their best to study molecules, atoms, electrons, ... Could our world still be a world that is "undifferentiated chaos"?</p>
<p>In reality, big things are not necessarily not confused, because under the style of "turning big things into small things, and small things into nothing," even the biggest things can pass by easily, with calm winds and waves, in exchange for a result of "pure quietude and non-action."</p>
<p>"Great wisdom appears foolish, great skill appears clumsy," no wonder many smart people are learning to be confused, pretending to be "seeing but not seeing, hearing but not hearing"!</p>
<p>In this way, some people say that "confusion" is cleverness, and it is a benefit, but what is questionable is: is a "person" who is "living like a corpse with leftover breath" still a "person"? Is it still the "spirit of all things"?</p>
<h3 id="e168">Professors Should Not Change Careers <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Chaochang</p>
<p>Reading the report in the 14th newspaper that university professors are changing careers and opening dance schools, after reading it, I spontaneously produced infinite thoughts.</p>
<p>Now I know that a certain professor of literature at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has abandoned his teaching career and opened a dance school because of "making a living." Whether this move is normal, I will not discuss it for the time being. But thinking of several professors in our school, they also started to abandon teaching and take up other jobs this summer. The purpose is also to maintain their lives. Under this situation, seeing the professors leaving their posts and going to other paths, is this a blessing or a misfortune for society? I think at least it is losing an ideal leader for the youth, and at least it is losing a talent who cultivates talents for the country. In the current process of building the country, of course talent is the first. Without talent, there is no way to build the country. Since we know that talent is important, then how can we let the talents who cultivate talents leave their posts? I see that the professors in the current universities are already lacking, especially the famous professors are even fewer. Under this situation, if we do not set up a strategy to retain the positions of the professors, then the future of China's university education will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>I remember that university professors went on strike last semester, and now I see that university professors are changing careers. "Going on strike" is their active way to struggle for a living, and "changing careers" is their passive way to improve their lives. But we should know that the active can be supplemented, while the passive is not reliable, so we cannot casually ignore the change of careers of university professors. At the same time, I dare say that the change of careers of university professors is exactly the harbinger of the impending crisis in Chinese education.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Free Port <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lin</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have announced a ban on the import of fabrics, silks, and woolens starting July 1st. Of course, this measure carries extraordinary significance and is definitely not aimed at saving the sales of local manufacturers' products. In fact, this ban is because, given the current situation, British goods in Hong Kong are likely to be unable to withstand the competition from American goods. Hong Kong is currently under British rule, and in order to maintain the inherent position of British goods in the Hong Kong market, the authorities have issued this import restriction order. The free port is no longer free.</p>
<p>American silks, fabrics, woolens, and daily necessities are currently being dumped into cities around the world, threatening business communities in all countries. Because of the current shortage of materials in our country, it seems that we need foreign goods to help us out. This kind of emergency relief is necessary, but it would be unwise to rely on foreign goods for a long time to maintain the domestic market. The supply of materials in a place like Hong Kong is not necessarily more abundant than in Shanghai. However, for their own benefit, the British authorities have first issued a ban on the import of silks, fabrics, and woolens. I think this ban may affect other imported goods in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, various foreign goods manufacturers in Shanghai are already feeling seriously threatened by the dumping of American goods. If everyone doesn't think of a way to save the situation, then the future of domestic goods will be unimaginable. However, our country is caught in the midst of national affairs, and it is difficult to solve political and military problems, making it even more difficult to find a solution to economic difficulties for the time being. What we can do is probably still support domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Municipal Government Building <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Zi</p>
<p>I walked around the Municipal Government building and felt that this building was constructed very solidly. This solidity seems to have exceeded the limits of residential solidity. Someone with some military knowledge said: If sandbags are piled up at a few entrances of this building, it would be a very good fortress; there is a plaza inside where tanks can move in and out; and the location is close to the Huangpu River, making supply and communication very convenient. This building used to be the Public Works Department of the former British Concession, showing how far-sighted the British were in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Heard in the Park <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shi</p>
<p>In Gujiazhai Garden, I heard the following words:</p>
<p>"I have been working here since the French ran this park. The wages used to be forty-eight yuan, which could buy five dan of rice. Now it is seventy-two thousand yuan, and it is not easy to buy even one dan of rice."</p>
<p>"The French were very serious about park management and had a fixed budget. Once the budget was decided, there were no changes. The money under the budget items was all used for park management, so the park was well managed. We used to be very efficient and had good results. But the current situation is completely different. There is no money for park repairs. Even if it is severely dilapidated and requires a single nail, it is necessary to submit an official request, which must be reviewed by three or four reviewing agencies. The time is so long that you will forget about it, but the result is often not easy to achieve. For example, the official request in March is still unknown."</p>
<p>"Park tickets should not be sold in theory. All countries in the world and ports in China do not buy tickets. The reason for buying tickets here is to limit the number of tourists? Those who enter the park can also be neater. This is also a convenient method, which is not impossible. However, the ticket revenue should be used entirely for the park's own operations. (Now it is handed over to the Finance Bureau as the city's recurring expenses.) Moreover, there are too many things to be done in the park, and nothing can be done without money. Now we are often scolded for not doing things well. In fact, a clever woman cannot cook a meal without rice, and it is thankless to perform while holding a stone mortar. It is really unjust and wronged."</p>
<p>"During a certain period (the enemy-puppet era), the person in charge of park management not only did not make any improvements to the park, but also told us to move the better flowers, trees, and chairs in the park to their private residences, and often asked two or three workers to weed and work in their private residences. They were our superiors, how could we not obey orders?"</p>
<p>"We are not flattering foreigners and insisting that the French are good. This is a fact. We always hope that after the Chinese manage it themselves, the results will be better than theirs."</p>
<p>Anyone who has recently visited the park can confirm that the above remarks are not wrong. Indeed, there are fewer chairs than before, and it is very difficult to find a chair when entering the park. Moreover, some of the chairs have long been broken beyond repair. There are not many exotic flowers and plants, and there are no new arrangements. More than thirty workers are only doing weeding and sweeping.</p>

<p>— Yun Kan</p>
<p>Someone named Wang was arrested and brought before the county magistrate for the crime of "receiving ill-gotten wealth"!</p>
<p>The county magistrate asked him, "Have you ever received 'legitimate' money?"</p>
<p>Wang replied, "Yes, only once, when your honor was elected as a senator last year, your honor rewarded me with five thousand yuan, a towel, and a bar of soap."</p>
<p>Mr. Lin said to one of his neighbors, "I heard that your son has returned from overseas!"</p>
<p>That neighbor replied:</p>
<p>"No, not returned from overseas, but from under the sea—don't you know he serves on a submarine?"</p>
<h3 id="e173">Don't Make a Fortune Illegally <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 9th carried a news item in a prominent position: "Poor Teacher Makes a Fortune Illegally by Embezzling 200 Million Yuan in Public Funds." After reading it, I was very surprised, sympathetic, and finally let out a long sigh. I never thought that someone who makes a living with pen and ink would do such a thing. It's truly "prices rise, and personality declines."</p>
<p>However, after thinking about it, I feel that this matter is not simple. In addition to this personal criminal act, it is accompanied by a serious problem in society. A poor teacher has limited income and cannot support his family. Therefore, he will think of many "making a fortune illegally" ideas. I think that a person who entrusts his career to education is mostly enthusiastic about serving the people. If he can live a decent life, he will definitely be content and will not cause such unfortunate things to happen in society.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, "military affairs were first," but in the post-war nation-building cause, "education is first." Therefore, I hope that government authorities and social elites will pay more attention to and improve the treatment of teachers. It is not enough to rely solely on one or two teacher appreciation campaigns to make up for it. That is not a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>But I bring the topic back again. People, despite being "poor," must be "poor" with ambition. Moreover, most intellectuals are "poor," but intellectuals are "pioneers" whose reason and insights are higher than ordinary people. Therefore, they should not be spineless, and I believe that most are not. They don't want to make any money and prefer to live a simple life. This is also the spirit of the excellent tradition of intellectuals. This spirit still exists.</p>
<p>Now, after seeing this news, we cannot help but regret that such a scum has emerged among intellectuals. We must know that although everyone loves "money," we must not risk making a fortune illegally, because this can lead to "one wrong step bringing eternal regret," and we will never be able to wash away our stains, harming us for life. Not only will we face lawsuits, but also our career and future will be lost. Here I sincerely advise everyone, "Don't make a fortune illegally!"</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Since you passed away, this home seems to have become a soulless place, and I seem to have become a soulless person. All day long, I wander around the garden like a walking corpse, reminiscing about the past, and getting some sweet memories. I remember that the eighth day of the first lunar month thirty years ago was the auspicious day of our wedding, which opened the door of happiness for me. Since then, starting a family and establishing a career have been entirely thanks to your assistance. Before the wedding, I already had someone in mind, but because she had been betrothed to someone else since childhood, the good thing did not work out. Both of us were timid children, succumbing to the clutches of the old etiquette and dare not act rashly. Although we had been corresponding for three years, we had never met or spoken a word. When she was forced to throw herself into someone else's arms, I was very distressed. A year later, my mother saw that I was too pitiful and persuaded me to choose a good marriage. I thought of you, whom I often met at my cousin Kan's house. Through my cousin, they entrusted a neighbor to propose marriage to your family. Your father immediately gave his consent, and married his only daughter to me, because at that time, the "Saturday" Weekly was popular, and he already knew my name. On the third day after you entered the door, I told you the whole story of that emotional public case without any concealment, and showed you her picture. Although you were a little unhappy, you also tried to tolerate it and only said to me, "The future is still long, as long as you are worthy of me." For thirty years, although I am still trapped in my own cocoon and cannot forget her, I respect you and love you, always as one. This is what you cannot deny, right? In the years that followed, we sometimes inevitably had some disputes over this matter, but we always tolerated and understood each other, and the emotions were quickly put away, without damaging our deep-rooted feelings. I remember that in my poems, there were these two poems: "The thread of love is on the body when I am young, it is difficult to brandish a sword and ten thousand threads are confusing; I have two hearts in two rooms, she occupies the first, and the second belongs to you." "Often feigning a slight anger, and often making cold remarks with subtle words; please understand that the past lingers in my heart, we are both people sharing the same quilt." I told you the meaning of the poems, and you were not offended, but only said that I was a fool. Yes! I am a fool in the arena of love, a fool for you, a fool for her, and this goes on in parallel until now.</p>
<p>A year after the marriage, you gave birth to Zheng'er for me. Unfortunately, you encountered a difficult delivery and were almost delayed by the midwife. We rushed to ask an obstetrician to perform surgery to deliver the baby. Fortunately, both mother and child were safe. However, the assistant was in a rush and accidentally spilled the chloroform on your face, causing swelling and ulceration, and it took more than a month to recover. When you were groaning and tossing, I saw you suffering great pain and fainted in a hurry. Less than ten days after giving birth, you got up to take care of the housework, and you were also breastfeeding yourself. It was extremely hard, but due to economic constraints, I had to trouble you. I remember that I later had three more poems "Teasing People," which were written for this purpose: "Seventeen-year-old Chang Jun, with a red thread and light powder; coming to the lip of the house to be a wife, don't sweep the eyebrows, sweep the steps." "In the past, I was timid and afraid of the empty room, but today I am suddenly a mother; after Lantian gave birth to jade, Tan slaves do not love children." "Household trivial matters are self-calculated, and the well and mortar are busy all day long; let's wait for the golden wedding flower candle night, why not let you be the groom?" When you heard the last one, you couldn't help but laugh and said, "You thought of it; if you want me to be the groom, you have to reincarnate!"</p>
<p>Over seventeen years, you gave birth to three sons and four daughters, a total of seven children. Originally, my mother and I were a desolate and lonely family, but thanks to your strength, it became a prosperous and respectable family. Fortunately, my economic situation gradually improved, so except for the second daughter, Ling, who was still breastfed by you, the other five hired wet nurses. Although it reduced some of your labor, you were still very busy. Although there were mothers and Granny Ye and Granny Wang who could help, you had to ask about everything, big and small; at the same time, you had to take the time to serve me, paying attention to everything I ate and wore; although my income has increased, you still refuse to waste a penny. Your spirit of diligence, thrift, hard work and endurance is truly great.</p>
