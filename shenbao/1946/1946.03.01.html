<h3>和平團結完成有望　张周馬昨日抵平　三氏今晨將飛往察綏視察</h3>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿八日電〕美特使馬歇爾，張治中將軍及周恩來將軍，於今晨山渝搭乘C—五四式巨型運输機，冒務飛向　雪之北平，於下午二時四十分抵達此间。衣西區飛機場歡迎之羣衆，有中國及火國軍事首長，文官及外交人員，美駐華使館參，及北平執行總部專員羅賓遜亦到場歡迎·馬張周三人與歡迎人員寒喧後，即驅軍入北平城，至執行總部所衣地之协和醫學校，当即與北平三专員鄭介民·葉劍英·羅賓遜舉行會議。此中國之「三巨頭」，預料将於明晨飛往張家口·察哈爾·集寗·及綏遠，即執行部流動視察團停止國共衝突已獲成功之各地，預定明日下午返平。馬歇爾在留平期間，將寄庽於美國大使馆內。當馬歇爾等之專機飛抵北平時，早晨之陰霾已經揭開，三人於明媚之春光中降落，同行者尙有最近來華之馬歇爾助理員吉蘭中將。魏德邁將軍亦將於明日自滬來平。據稱吉蘭與魏听邁之北來，與執行總部並無關　，而「純係巧合」。</p>
<p>举行鷄尾酒会</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕調處執行部三委員，廿八日晚假北京飯店舉行鷄尾酒會，歡迎張周馬三氏，熊式輝。孫連仲及英·美·蘇盟邦重要官長皆被邀出席，赴會者紛紛與三氏談話，情緒甚見融洽，各地共黨代表，與周恩來相談尤歡。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕執行部政府方面人士，暗示馬袱爾在完成其華北及漢粵之視察後，第二期視察地區可能爲東北。中共發言人則稱：在關於東北問題，政府中共未獲進一步協议前，馬歇爾恐不可能有東北之行。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處北平廿八日電〕三人軍事小组今日下午抵平，旋即由馬歇爾特使在調處執行部招待記者，據稱：「阻止中國內戰，致力和平與團結之人物，就完成工作而言，現已具有原望目前吾人之任務，較之中止戰事一項工作，更爲重要與艱困。我人之任務二厥為依照三人军事小組在渝所成立之协定，统一中國軍隊，並實行復員。許多人咸認此種問題恐非和平方式所能解次，若以獲致協定並无困難一點相吿，必令人詫異。雖然，今者協定業已成立矣，調處執行部之任務，乃在監導其實施工作。國共雙方及美方人員在調處執行部共同「工作時之和諧，實爲世界史中所僅見者。」周恩來與張治中兩氏對於調處執行部美方人員之卓著服務，大加讚揚，表示謝意。兩氏均以中國之內戰，比諸家庭中兄妹之爭，並主張將孰是孰非問題，置於一旁，而先使中國團結一致。周氏稱：「讓我們把團結的工作完成了吧！現在不是斤斤較量和決定孰是孰非的時候。」</p>
<h3>中央公務員　待遇新準備</h3>
<p>國防最高委會通過</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿八日電〕中央公務人員待遇，從二月份起改善，提高支給標準，業經廿五日國防最高委員會例會通過，其辦法（一）昆明·迪化·康定·歸綏及包頭等五地之基本數為五萬元，加倍數爲一百五十倍。（二）重慶·京·滬·平·津·桂林·廣州·衡陽·長沙·雲南及新疆等地之基本數四萬元，加倍數一百三十倍。（三）川·</p>
<p>黔·鄂·蘇·粵·桂·陜·晋·冀·靑島·甘及湘等地基本數三萬五千元，加倍數一百一十倍。（四）浙·閩·皖·贛·魯·豫·綏·寗·靑·察等地之基本數為直萬元，加倍數九十倍。</p>
<h3>改進司法工作　今後着重三点</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕司法行政部為適應戰後建國需要，積極推動司法改革工作，今後之計劃，聞將着重三點：（一）監獄之改良，使之合乎現代化，（二）司法人才之培養與素質之提高，（三）司法制度之改革。關於司法制度改革工作，該部已呈准行政院，延聘世界法學權威法制改革專家龐德博士為顧問，一俟國府還都，龐氏即將自美啓程來華。</p>
<h3>收復區郵政接收順利　中共區通郵無阻　全國各局每月虧蝕甚鉅</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕記者頃走訪郵政總局副局長谷春帆氏，詢以收復區及中共佔領區之郵政近况，據云收復區郵政之接收，除中共佔領區外，業經全部順利完成。在敵偽期間各該地區郵工奉命留守，生活至為艱苦，勝利以前半年間，每一郵政員工薪津，不足二斗米之值，造成郵員普遍怠忽職務，以及信差索取小費之陋習，接收以後，蔪津略爲提高，此種不良現象，經積極整頓已完全根絕。至於目前寄往中共佔領區郵件，並無阻礙，其由中共地區寄出之郵件數量極少。凡在中共區城之郵局，現仍歸交通部管轄，惟中共設有交通局，與地方郵局「合作」，某些地帶甚至貼用毛澤東像之中共郵票，此實為侵擾郵政之不法行為。東北郵政接收正在努力進行中，目前司勢未定，信件往還尙多困難。谷氏又稱，郵政收人已不能與戰前相比，據最近之統計，全國各郵局，平均每月虧蝕總數十三億至十四億元，僅江蘇郵區月虧即達二億元，以上上海郵區戰前係最富盈餘者，現亦僅能維持收支平衡。抗戰勝利一切工作能皆復員，郵政固不能例外，　諜有以改進，惟須視交通恢復情形，及一般物價而決定，否則郵政前途，殊多荆棘。</p>
<h3>郵電檢查　今日起停止</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕關係方而傳出消息，我政府頃已下令，自三月一日起停止郵電險查。</p>
<h3>整軍案簽字觀禮</h3>
<p>本報重慶航訊</p>
<p>一月廿四日晚上，記者得到中央宣傳部新聞處的通知，說第二天午後四時，有一個重要文件——三人軍事小組會議的新成就，新協議，要在中四路堯廬簽字，要記者出席觀禮。對於這一個消息，所有同業都感奮不已！</p>
<p>翌日，（廿五日）淸晨，天色原有幾分陰曇，可是一過中午，太陽灩　而出，大地上鍍了一層金，總象徴着是該些有喜事。</p>
<p>禮堂裏面鋪着黃色帶淺紅之花的地氈，正中設着一張書案，上面簡單的放着一塊玻璃版和文房四賽，書案兩旁立着水銀燈，書案後面是垂着紫紅幃幕的屛門，通到里面的休息室。禮堂兩端各放一張大方桌，潔白的檯布上，放着盛了「幸福牌」名烟的黑漆盒子。此外，沿牆都是椅子，但是站着的人還有三分之一。</p>
<p>四點五十分，馬歇爾元帥和他的隨員們涖臨，穿過禮堂，到後面休息室去了。四點五十八分，三份方案的原本被張治中部長的譯官拿了出來，放在書案上，這是三個藍綢被面的册子。記者們立刻緊張起來，一起站了起來，在書案前圍了個半圓。水銀燈亮了起來，掩沒了幾盞放着柔光的壁燈。在攝影機的軋軋聲中馬帥先走了出來。張部長與周恩來氏也相隨步入禮堂，這時站在後而的記者，已老實不客氣的站在精子上了。張部長一出來，就一直走去坐在書案前，開始簽字，他將三個原本一本本的寫過搬到右邊。周恩來氏第二個簽字，他迅捷的將它們又搬到左邊去。這時馬帥正和張部長的譯官商量如何簽法。結果，他取出了懷中的派克五十一，將三份册子，一個個地橫過來簽了字。隨後由張部長代表政府致詞，保證實現這個方案。對於馬帥尤其讚仰備至，他說國人有好幾個名字來稱呼馬帥，第一個是：「中國和平建國的產婆」當馬帥聽到“Mic　wife”這字時，原來持着微笑的嘴角，不自主的拉了開來。第二個名字：「中共與政府之間的媒人」譯官　「媒人」難住了，回過身來問宣傳部的李惟果副部長，李副部長想了一想，說「用“Go　between”好了，」記者們來了個哄堂，但是外國朋友，連馬帥在內都沒會意。第三個名字是：「美國人民和政府送到中國的和平使節，」「這三個名字，任何一個馬歇爾將軍都當之無媿。馬將軍是中國最偉大的友人！」周恩來氏也代表中共向政府，中國人民，友邦人士，保證一定實行這方案。他說：「相信由這個文件，可以澄淸過去武力紛爭的局面，而代以統一，團結，和平，建國。」他特別提出這方案的實施，在全國各地和任何武裝部隊都沒有例外。他也歸功於馬帥，並且感謝共同努力二十年的張部長，最後希望能通過記者們和報紙的努力，使全國人民督促這方案的實現。</p>
<p>馬帥最後講話，詞雖簡短，語重心長，旣畢，侍役送上茶點，三氏就一回乾了一杯香檳，又給攝影記者一個好境頭。這時，記者羣紛紛包圍張部長和周恩來先生，記者首先拿出名片，請馬帥簽字。南京中央日報記者吳君也搶先請張周二氏簽字，三位又着實爲這忙了一陣。記者羣也連連乾杯，互祝幸運，同慶和平。到四時五十五分，馬帥吿辭，張部長和周先生都送到車前。一乘兩星將車，帶走了這位嘉賓，於是這一珍貴的記者招待會宣吿散會。（廿四日寄）</p>
<h3>工程師學會　追悼張莘夫</h3>

<h3>長春我當局　招待外記者</h3>
<p>定今舉行茶會</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿七日電〕外記者來長後，今為第三日，渠等稱：過去兩日來悶居斗室之內，雖煩悶亦無可如何，今日在街頭活動，雖不能看到全市，但稍覺暢快。渠等曾請謁馬林諾夫斯基元帥，以公忙未獲見，下午曾訪軍事代表團董彥平團長及長春市長趙君邁，聞軍事代表團等將於三月一日舉行茶會招待，渠等赴哈爾濱否尚未定。</p>
<h3>東北蘇軍撤退問題　正在莫斯科談判　我將派大軍加强接收工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕重慶訊：據悉，我政府決派三十萬大軍前往東北，加强接收工作。東北現有國軍約六萬人，將有二十萬人由各地繼續調派，上海·靑島等處之國軍，共有十萬人，正待交通工具北上。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕東北蘇軍最近有增無减，某新自長春歸來之官方人士語記者，在長購買香烟即感困難，因大批蘇軍官自歐洲東來，長春香烟幾已配銷蘇軍官一空也。官方表示，要求蘇聯撤兵之談判，已在莫斯科進行，惟能否成功，尙難臆度，蓋我方希望蘇先履約撤兵，再談條約以外問題，蘇方則圖先確定其在東北之經濟利益，再談撤兵，而其對經濟利益之要求，似又頗堅持。傳上次蔣經國赴蘇，蘇當局曾對之日，蘇聯對東北戰利品之解釋與處理辦法，一如在東歐各國所實施者，非獨對中國東北為然，似此，經濟問題之糾葛，恐非迎刃可解。而另方面，蘇聯似視「時間」為其有用之友人，因若再假蘇方以三兩月時間，彼等即可從容消化其衣東北之戰利品，並扶植較國民政府更為親蘇之力量。以此，東北之局勢，遂如瘧疾，而寒熟無常矣。目前東北接收工作實際停頓，安東高惜氷主席迄未赴任，興安主席吳煥章，大連市長沈怡中途折返，合江主席吳瀚濤與黑龍江主席韓駿傑，刻仍逗留哈爾濱旅邸，且每夜和衣就寢，故皆虱子滿身。目前長·哈兩地接收人員，已深爲進退維谷所苦。長春鐵路理事會雖已成立，但實權皆屬於蘇方，聞蘇方職員中有四分之三係紅軍官兵改業，東北廠礦接收，自張莘夫犧牲後，亦歸停頓，但聞我方對舊中東路（自滿洲里至綏芬河）以南之廠礦次不讓步，中東路東北地區則尙可商量容納蘇方資本技術，一般人判斷，白崇禧將軍之來平，其任務不在於檢閱軍隊，而在於與熊式輝·李宗仁·杜聿明檢討北方軍事情勢，由此可顯示巾樞常局對北方之關切與重視。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕國務大臣培克昨在下院，答保守黨議員賽伏里之問稱：中蘇兩國政府，正在談判駐滿洲蘇軍撤退之日期，職是之故，余於目前未便有所宣布。</p>
<p>〔中央社潘陽廿七日合衆電〕東北蘇軍似有久留之意，旅順港新到蘇軍三萬至四萬名，此係增援，而非調防，俾支援現存之蘇軍，今正分派至東北各駐軍區，大連及哈爾濱亦包括在內。</p>
<h3>社論　庫頁島千島之改隷</h3>
<p>本年二十日蘇聯最高蘇維埃議會主席頒布命令，將南庫頁島及千島列島併入蘇聯版圖；同時，並將該地之交通·銀行·企業·公用事業及運輸設備，收歸國有；至是向之視爲蘇聯出太平洋之障礙盡除，千島庫頁諸島正式改隷蘇聯，而爲蘇聯遠東之一部。同月廿六日，美國務卿員爾納斯在美京記者招待會席次，就蘇聯此舉有所關述：曾謂：「美國接受協議之約束，已同意支持將該項土地讓與蘇聯，日後締結條約時，彼將主張美國應履踐其諾言，而於條約內加入上稱土地劃入蘇聯片圖之條文　　至是，蘇聯之歸併庫頁千島，不特已爲旣成事實，抑且得有美國政府之支持。在今日東北陰霾有待廓淸，國際紛爭有待淸除之際，對於蘇聯之歸併千島庫頁，或未嘗為世人所注意·此項土地之歸併不特足使蘇聯勢力深入太平洋中，抑且使整個太平洋間的關係產生一種新局面；我國位處太平洋西岸，對此太平洋新局勢，尤應密切注意。對於蘇聯之歸併千島庫頁，我　因之不論不有一言。</p>
<p>第一，蘇聯之歸併庫頁千島原係基於雅爾達之恊議。雅爾達恊議縱有英美蘇三國的參加，但不能認為有一般的國際拘束力。且係一種秘密協定，其所成立有關土地轉讓之恊議，論其性質，接近私相授受，毫無法理依據。對於日本所有土地的處分，除非法因侵略而取得者外，應由對日作戰各國，特別是對日作戰各主要國家一致贊同支持，方能轉讓。我國對日作戰歷時最久，犠牲最大，對於如何處分日本土地，理應有權過問。中國不曾參加雅爾達恊定，雅爾達所成立之協議，對中國無拘束力，故基於雅爾達恊議而有的庫頁千島之歸併蘇聯，我們應保留提出要求之權。在此盛行「權力政治」的今日，我們不能不提出此一問題的法理意義，庶幾法治精神能見於國際行為，國際秩序得以維繫。</p>
<p>第二，頁一島於明時會隸中國版圖；明室初立，永樂帝經營邊疆，威力遠及今西伯利亞東部黑龍江口一帶地，且復設衛戍兵，庫頁島與黑龍江口一帶地，隔　　海峽相望，入冬且又凍結，明兵經略斯地，有吏可稽。觀乎此島之有中國名稱，尤可見其　隸中國版圖。淸初尼布楚條約，以外興安嶺一帶地割據與俄　於是中國與庫頁之關係遂絕。從歷史的觀點論，中國對於庫頁島的改隷，不能默無一言。</p>
<p>然而且今舉竟是「權力政治」時代，我國所顧慮的是因蘇聯的併人庫頁千島，使太平洋上的權力關係發生了新的動盪，太平洋上產生了一種新的局勢。這種新的局勢是什麼？這就是蘇聯在北太平洋上現已占有支配的局勢。俄國自彼得大帝努力經營以來，其一貫的願望，就是要出海，要有海洋。在歐洲，這個願望受到阻止，在亞洲及遠東　偶　　也受到阻止。如今庫頁千島改隷了蘇聯，它在太平洋上，特別是北次平洋上，占有着控制的地位。千島與北美的阿留申羣島相望；　河留　羣島一度曾逍遇日軍的攻占。沙皇彼得大帝的夢竟在反對沙　主義的史達林委員長之下得到實現。宿願得償，此在蘇聯人民，其情緒當不難想像。</p>
<p>原子能秘密在加拿大的洩漏，中國的東北陰霾未散，而北太平洋的均勢却已改觀了。人類在經過珍珠港的教訓以後，應該有一種新覺醒。我們願太平洋能够長此太平！</p>

<h3>王外長發表談話　盼越南紛爭能公允解決</h3>

<h3>今日籃球聯賽　精彩大戰　華聯對巨人</h3>

<h3>客帮乘廉吸收　紗市人心轉穩　現棉交易吊滯</h3>
<p>昨日紗市重見蘇甦，良以連日所跌已巨，觀望數日之客帮，乘廉吸收，價乃回漲四萬至七萬，具有皮球性之十六支光明紗，始則降至八十三萬繼則回到八十九萬，收市人心轉穩，趨勢平平，紡建公司昨繼續平售各支棉紗，以應廠方需要，聞今日將平售棉布云。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况續疲，交易亦大見减色，緣紗布市况乏力而廠家殺價甚低，致雙方談判，難於接近，紡建公司亦在觀望，未有採辦，此外民營紗廠僅申新第六廠稍有十六支原料火機花二三百包需要，價比上日再小一二千元。</p>
<h3>金價續小</h3>
<p>給赤晨開以補空有人，價見一四二萬元，最高曾達一四五萬元，嗣因謠傳美匯將爲一千對一，並聞當局黃金掛牌在即，人心軟化，多頭脫手，中途曾低至一三七萬元，十一時左右北帮補進，價又回至一四〇萬元，下午市勢續趨軟化，以一三八萬元仍鮮去路，</p>
<p>外幣因金價續挫，人心軟化，買戶觀望，各比前市再疲，美票低見二千元左右，港票老貨三七〇元，新貨均跌三元，</p>

<h3>呢羢春銷開展　本街辦胃特健</h3>
<p>昨呢羢本街銷路不寂，因春銷賡續發動，中西裝男婦服飾，各界選辦紛起，一般店家，鑒於出路日廣，進胃因此亦健，如信大祥·協大祥·寬大祥·立與祥·及四大公司等，俱有强健之進胃，四川路·霞飛路·大新街·靜安寺路各區服裝帮，均有相當採購，公茶會上標準貨價，因鹽存貨缺乏，及中紡前所派出者，多係厚貨而乏薄貨，價且照市無甚便宜，又未能普及，更兼黃白貨狂漲與種種環境關係，男女色光毛粗細呢羢行情莫不全部挺秀。</p>
<h3>絲綢繼續下隆</h3>
<p>人造絲四日內跌落五十萬元，　市一二〇天橋現貨開盤一百九十萬元，收盤一百七十五萬元，午後做一百七十七萬元，半光升十萬元，無光更昻，成交價二百三十餘萬元，廠絲另担價疲，交易甚熟，干經五担頭討似一百五十萬元，還價一百四十萬元未成交，綢貨略軟，美亞被面較上日短一萬元，大誠格壁縐小一百元，民生織錦緞低一千元。</p>

<h3>茶市交易不暢</h3>
<p>紅綠茶花色，成交數量依然未見展開，買戶鑒於日來本市物價迂迥下降，企圖抑低而取，但貨方則値此市存將罄之際，續待善價而沽，是以雙方雖仍有談盤，終難接近，乃紙僅零星做開，市呈堅靜之勢，價格方面，呆定乏變，昨日做開　峯龍井二百四十萬元，諸暨紅茶七萬二千元，黃山珠蘭十四萬元云。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>昨日　布全日交易圖珊，容帮猶處觀望之態度中，午後略見回好，</p>

<p>中國標準織造廠　出品標準牌手帕，歷史已久，戰時因受環境影響，暫時停止工作，勝利後即大　擴充，精心整頓，現已恢復生產。</p>

<h3>重逢</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>冬的夜晚，我們跨進一家酒館揀一個臨街的座位坐下來。天氣很冷，像快要落雪的樣子，路燈發着　淡的光莣，這條街在平時是相當繁榮的，但今兒却顯得異常落漠，僅有的幾個行人也縮着頭頸匆促走過。</p>
<p>多少年的分別，都使我們變得　默下來了，要說世間有多大，　在令人難以置信。就是昨天，我們偶而在路上碰見了，是那麼突然的，他是才從山城來，他吿訴我，地簡直不敢相信我在這樣繁囂的都市會獃得這麼久。</p>
<p>我們似乎有很多話要說，分別　六年，這悠久的歲月裘的變動實在太大了，但我們却好像不知從何說起，時間畢竟太短，他說他明兒就要離開這兒了。我們祇能面對面坐着，互相視着，讓燒酒一盅盅灌到肚子裏。</p>
<p>也忽然想起了什麼，他問我</p>
<p>「你結婚了吧？」</p>
<p>「沒有」，我對他苦笑。</p>
<p>「那末一點羅曼史呢！」</p>
<p>我還是對他搖頭，他似乎很失望的樣子，他像在說，這些日子我是怎樣打發的啊。</p>
<p>我反問他：「你呢？」</p>
<p>他聽着我的問話，臉上掠過　層　發的光彩，他的語腔似乎也　朗起來了，他看樣子很得　。</p>
<p>我不能像你，我已經結了婚，而且不久我們就快有小孩子呢！」說着他從懷包裏掏出一張像片說：</p>
<p>「送給你吧！你看我的太太不錯吧！兩隻大眼睛珠子，我們認識了有三年，她還在大學裏唸書呢。」</p>
<p>「幸福的人，」我向他敬了一杯酒，他很快地接過去一飲而盡。</p>
<p>他的氣質還是那麼愉快，酒喝多了，他呵呵地笑着，他並且小聲告訴我。</p>
<p>「就在這裏，雖然短短幾天，我還鬧過點戀愛呢，那個女人眞可愛，但後來她聽說我結過婚，就不理我啦。」</p>
<p>「你不怕你太太曉得傷心。」</p>
<p>「喲，這算不得什麼的，我們要好得很，這不過逢塲作戲，多少年來，什麼都變了，就是這點老脾氣沒改。」</p>
<p>他這話逗得我們都笑——我向他說：</p>
<p>「你一點沒改，還是那老樣子。」</p>
<p>「你也是呢。」</p>
<p>這似乎是我們最後互相的發現，時候已經很晚，酒館裏的人祗剩下寥寥幾個，我們滑到街上，一陣冷風迎面括過來，凍得人祇打哆嗦，我們幾乎同時說：</p>
<p>「天眞冷呢。」</p>
<h3>虞山唐瘦青的人物書</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>一提到中國的人物畫，好像馬上就會聯想到「曹衣出水，吳帶當風」的那種古大家的神采奕奕風格的高妙。可是，這種風格，也只有從歷史的傳說中來體會了。</p>
<p>如果我們在此要看一看晚唐諸家如張萱畫的貴公子，周　畫的美婦人，宋代李公麟的白描，也是一件不容易的事實。所以要想探究中國人物畫的風格，也許只有在明淸兩代諸家的作品上研討了。</p>
<p>考宋元以上，人物畫多以道釋爲主，到明代，才可看出有道釋歷史風俗和傳神的三種傾向。可是道釋一項，徐沁「明畫錄」中說：「近時高手，旣不能擅塲，而徒詭曰不屑。儒坊廡寺，盡淸俗筆，無復可觀者矣。」正就是指出它的厄運，歷史風俗，確非常發達，仇十洲便是一位代表作家，他不但秀麗、艷逸、工整、精巧，而且多參用古法，別出心裁。至明末的南陳北崔，也是絕世巨匠，陳洪綏的風格趨奇古，崔子忠則追高逸，對淸代的任氏兄弟的風格，建立了一個穩妥的基礎。至於傳神，當時有閩中曾波臣爲代表，雖然到淸代還感行，畢竟是缺少中國固有藝術的韻味。</p>
<p>在淸代三百年中，人物畫的發達，實在只有歷史風俗的一項，這一項中間，我們又可分爲二大部門，即風俗故實和士女，前者，還是以仇英與陳崔的風格爲中心，乾嘉時期，仇派最盛，後發展而爲獨立的士女畫，道光成豐年間的改七薌，費曉樓作品的淸秀妍雅，瀟洒出塵，眞可尊爲逸品，至後者，則是在淸季才吿鼎盛哩。</p>
<p>吾虞唐君瘦靑，是愛好人物畫藝術的一位忠實作家，他費了二十多年的心血，只是在近代人物畫中心的風格上下苦工，時常對仇、改、費、諸家的規模上找綫素，苦思，追摹，小心地落墨，謹愼地施色，這許多寳貴的時光中，積下了這些作品，論風格，不特秀麗，而且古雅，不特工整，而且謹嚴，是藝術的虔誠者，我們對他道第一次在靑年會的展覽，應該予以另外的看待。</p>
<h3>已卯歲暮偕友在法南海濱遊覧五日寄懷巴黎施肇䕫</h3>
<p>— 金問泗</p>
<p>昆池劫換竹林歡，聚散匆匆幾欲蘭；灘岸浪迥聲勢壯棕梠日落海山寒。遠牀意氣懷劉毅，乞　蒼生屬謝安；勝負殘棋同有責，相期努力勸加餐。</p>
<h3>步韻答金使問泗</h3>
<p>— 施肇</p>
<p>五日流連豈盡歡，遙知惜別歲將闌；河山依舊烟雲好，滄海橫流風雪寒。尙有尺書來慰我，猶憐獨客在長安；何當與爾重相見，莫笑人言說素餐。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（十七）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>翁老爺不但言中了墨老爺的事，而且也言中了自已的事。就在墨太太生麗華的同年冬天，翁二太太也生了一個女兒。而且他的女兒和墨老爺的女兒，果然也像她們的母親一樣—成爲了好朋友。因爲這個原故，他的女兒也由墨老爺替她命了名，呌麗雲。</p>
<p>墨老爺羞窘得漲紅了臉，他很狠地拍了一下桌子，想說什麼，又嚥住了。</p>
<p>「再說，男孩兒念書，應該；女孩兒念書，作什麼？橫豎你不安好心，你凈想法兒欺負我。」墨太太說罷，也用力地拍了一下桌子。</p>
<p>父母們的爭吵，使孩子們覺得不安的很，也覺得可笑！同時並不能因此而减少孩子們對墨老爺的親近，他們很自然地需要常和墨老爺在一起，因爲他們的求知慾，是墨太太所不能够滿足的</p>
<p>墨老爺因此而驕傲，他爲這種驕傲而愉快！他一生不曾有過這種經騐。因爲他一生也不曾有過一樣事情，是讓他値得驕傲的</p>
<p>「少華，我眞高興呀！你並不爲了你媽媽而不睬我。」</p>
<p>墨老爺在和墨太太吵過架以後，墨太太强把麗華從墨老爺身邊拉走，但是轉限之問，麗十華又悄悄地回到了墨老爺的身邊。所以墨老爺欣慰地這樣向　華說。</p>
<p>麗華微笑地倀依着墨老爺，並不言語。</p>
<p>墨老爺緊緊抱住了麗華，一陣勝利的喜悅，使他忘記了剛才　的不快，而且忘記了歷年的煩憂，他與舊地告訴麗華一個故事，一個夢的故事。他有聲有色地講述着七年前，麗華誕生前夕的那個奇怪的夢。</p>
<p>麗華靜靜地傾聽着，像傾聽一段有趣的神話，她不了解這段神話與她有什麼關係，她也絕沒有想到這段神話裏面，隱隱預言了她的一生。</p>
<p>墨老爺最後把翁老爺的解釋作了個結論，他溫存地撫着麗華的頭說：</p>
<p>「你翁伯伯的話，完全言中了，咱們爺兒兩果然有緣！你果然喜歡爸爸，你第一次看見爸爸就笑了！你眞是爸爸的掌上珠呀！」</p>
<p>麗華又笑了，這一次，她竟失聲大笑！由於她的笑，換回墨老爺那個七年前的記憶—她笑得和剛剛墮地的時候一樣，她笑得像夢中的黃鸝清唱！</p>

<h3>Hopeful Progress for Peace and Unity: Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Arrive in Beiping Yesterday; Three Figures to Fly to Chahar and Suiyuan This Morning for Inspection</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] U.S. Special Envoy Marshall, General Zhang Zhizhong, and General Zhou Enlai flew from Chongqing this morning aboard a C-54 transport plane, braving the snow towards Beiping, arriving here at 2:40 PM. The crowd at the West District Airport welcoming them included Chinese and American military leaders, civil officials, and diplomatic personnel. The American consulate staff in China, and Commissioner Robinson of the Beiping Executive Headquarters were also present to welcome them. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou drove into the city of Beiping to the Union Medical College, the location of the Executive Headquarters, where they immediately held a meeting with the three Beiping Commissioners Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robinson. These "Three Giants" of China are expected to fly to Zhangjiakou, Chahar, Jining, and Suiyuan tomorrow morning, to conduct a mobile inspection of areas where the Executive Headquarters has successfully stopped the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists. They are scheduled to return to Beiping tomorrow afternoon. During his stay in Beiping, Marshall will reside at the American Embassy. When Marshall's plane arrived in Beiping, the morning haze had cleared, and the three landed in the bright spring sunshine. Also accompanying them was Lieutenant General Gillem, Marshall's assistant who recently arrived in China. General Wedemeyer will also arrive in Beiping from Shanghai tomorrow. It is said that Gillem and Wedemeyer's arrival in Beiping has nothing to do with the Executive Headquarters and is "purely coincidental."</p>
<p>Cocktail Party Held</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 28th] The three commissioners of the Mediation Executive Headquarters held a cocktail party at the Beijing Hotel on the evening of the 28th to welcome Marshall, Zhou, and Zhang. Xiong Shihui, Sun Lianzhong, and important officials from the Allied nations of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were all invited to attend. Those who attended spoke with the three figures one after another, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. Communist Party representatives from various regions especially enjoyed their conversations with Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] Government sources in the Executive Headquarters hinted that after completing his inspection of North China and the Han-Yue region, Marshall's second inspection area may be the Northeast. The Communist spokesman stated that Marshall's trip to the Northeast is unlikely before further agreement is reached between the government and the Communists on the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Beiping, 28th] The three-man military group arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Special Envoy Marshall then hosted reporters at the Mediation Executive Headquarters, stating: "The individuals who are working to prevent civil war and strive for peace and unity in China have now made hopeful progress in completing their work. Our current task is more important and difficult than the task of stopping the war. Our task is to unify the Chinese army and implement demobilization in accordance with the agreement established by the three-man military group in Chongqing. Many people believe that such problems cannot be resolved peacefully. It would be surprising to learn that there were no difficulties in reaching an agreement. However, an agreement has now been reached, and the task of the Mediation Executive Headquarters is to supervise its implementation. The harmony among the Nationalist, Communist, and American personnel working together in the Mediation Executive Headquarters is unprecedented in world history." Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong praised the outstanding service of the American personnel in the Mediation Executive Headquarters and expressed their gratitude. Both likened the Chinese civil war to a quarrel between siblings in a family and advocated putting aside the question of right and wrong and first uniting China. Zhou said: "Let us complete the work of unity! Now is not the time to quibble and decide who is right and wrong."</p>

<h3>Improving Judicial Work; Three Key Points to Be Emphasized in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] In order to adapt to the needs of national reconstruction after the war, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is actively promoting judicial reform. It is reported that future plans will focus on three points: (1) The improvement of prisons to make them modern; (2) The cultivation of judicial talent and the improvement of their quality; (3) The reform of the judicial system. Regarding the reform of the judicial system, the ministry has obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to hire Dr. Pound, a world authority on jurisprudence and a legal reform expert, as a consultant. Once the National Government returns to the capital, Pound will depart from the United States for China.</p>
<h3>Smooth Postal Service Restoration in Recovered Areas; Unimpeded Mail Delivery to Communist Areas; Significant Monthly Losses for All Bureaus Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] This reporter recently visited Mr. Gu Chunfan, Deputy Director-General of the Postal Administration, to inquire about the current status of the postal service in the recovered areas and the Communist-occupied areas. According to him, the postal service restoration in the recovered areas has been completed smoothly, except for the Communist-occupied areas. During the enemy-puppet period, postal workers in these areas were ordered to remain on duty and lived in extremely difficult conditions. In the six months before the victory, the salary of each postal worker was worth less than two dou of rice, resulting in widespread dereliction of duty among postal workers and the bad habit of letter carriers demanding tips. After the restoration, salaries were slightly increased, and this undesirable phenomenon has been completely eradicated through active rectification. As for mail currently sent to Communist-occupied areas, there are no obstacles, but the quantity of mail sent from Communist areas is extremely small. All post offices in Communist areas are still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, but the Communists have established a Bureau of Communications that "cooperates" with local post offices. In some areas, Communist stamps with images of Mao Zedong are even being used, which is an illegal act that infringes upon the postal service. The postal service restoration in the Northeast is currently underway, but the situation is still uncertain, and mail exchange is still difficult. Mr. Gu also stated that postal revenue cannot be compared with that before the war. According to recent statistics, the total monthly loss for all post offices nationwide averages between 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion yuan. The monthly loss for the Jiangsu postal district alone is as high as 200 million yuan. The Shanghai postal district, which was the most profitable before the war, is now only able to maintain a balance between income and expenditure. After the victory of the War of Resistance, all work can be restored, and the postal service is no exception. Improvements are anticipated, but they will depend on the recovery of transportation and general commodity prices; otherwise, the future of the postal service will be fraught with difficulties.</p>
<h3>Postal and Telegraph Inspection to Cease Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Sources have revealed that our government has recently issued an order to cease postal and telegraph inspection from March 1st.</p>
<h3>Signing Ceremony for Military Reorganization Plan Observed</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper Chongqing Air Mail</p>
<p>On the evening of January 24th, the reporter received a notice from the Press Office of the Central Propaganda Department stating that at 4:00 PM the following day, an important document—a new achievement, a new agreement of the Three-Man Military Group meeting—would be signed at the Yao Mansion on Zhongsi Road, and that reporters were required to attend the ceremony. All colleagues were greatly encouraged by this news!</p>
<p>The next day (January 25th), the sky was somewhat overcast in the morning, but after noon, the sun burst forth, plating the earth with a layer of gold, generally symbolizing happy events.</p>
<p>Inside the auditorium, a yellow carpet with light red flowers was laid. In the center was a desk, simply furnished with a sheet of glass and writing materials. Mercury lamps stood on either side of the desk, and behind it was a screen with purple-red curtains, leading to the inner lounge. At each end of the hall were large square tables covered with white tablecloths, on which were placed black lacquered boxes containing "Happiness Brand" cigarettes. In addition, there were chairs along the walls, but still a third of the people were standing.</p>
<p>At 4:50 PM, Marshal Marshall and his entourage arrived, passed through the hall, and went to the lounge behind. At 4:58 PM, the original texts of the three plans were brought out by Minister Zhang Zhizhong's translator and placed on the desk. These were three volumes bound in blue silk. The reporters immediately became tense, stood up together, and formed a semicircle around the desk. The mercury lamps lit up, eclipsing several wall lamps with soft light. In the whirring sound of the cameras, Marshal Marshall came out first. Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou Enlai also stepped into the hall. At this time, the reporters standing in the back impolitely stood on chairs. As soon as Minister Zhang came out, he walked straight to the desk, sat down, and began to sign, moving each of the three original copies to the right after writing on them. Mr. Zhou Enlai signed second, quickly moving them to the left again. At this time, Marshal Marshall was discussing the signing method with Minister Zhang's translator. As a result, he took out his Parker 51 from his pocket and signed each of the three volumes horizontally. Subsequently, Minister Zhang delivered a speech on behalf of the government, guaranteeing the implementation of this plan. He especially praised Marshal Marshall, saying that the Chinese people had several names to call Marshal Marshall. The first was: "The midwife of China's peaceful nation-building." When Marshal Marshall heard the word "midwife," the corners of his smiling mouth involuntarily widened. The second name: "The matchmaker between the Communist Party and the government." The translator was stumped by "matchmaker" and turned to ask Li Weiguo, the Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department. Li Weiguo thought for a moment and said, "Use 'Go-between.'" The reporters burst into laughter, but the foreign friends, including Marshal Marshall, did not understand. The third name was: "The envoy of peace sent to China by the American people and government." "Any one of these three names is worthy of General Marshall. General Marshall is the greatest friend of China!" Mr. Zhou Enlai also represented the Communist Party in assuring the government, the Chinese people, and friendly nations that this plan would definitely be implemented. He said: "I believe that this document can clarify the past situation of armed conflict and replace it with unity, solidarity, peace, and nation-building." He particularly emphasized that the implementation of this plan had no exceptions in any region or among any armed forces nationwide. He also attributed credit to Marshal Marshall and thanked Minister Zhang, who had worked together for twenty years. Finally, he hoped that through the efforts of the reporters and newspapers, the people of the whole country would urge the implementation of this plan.</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall spoke last, his words were brief but heartfelt. After he finished, servants served tea and snacks, and the three gentlemen each finished a glass of champagne, giving the photographers a good shot. At this time, the reporters surrounded Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou Enlai. The reporter first took out his business card and asked Marshal Marshall to sign it. Wu Jun, a reporter from the Nanjing Central Daily News, also took the lead in asking Zhang and Zhou to sign, and the three were indeed busy for a while. The reporters also repeatedly toasted, wishing each other good luck and celebrating peace. At 4:55 PM, Marshal Marshall said goodbye, and Minister Zhang and Mr. Zhou both escorted him to his car. A two-star general's car took away this distinguished guest, and this precious press conference was declared adjourned. (Sent on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Engineers' Society Commemorates Zhang Xinfu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] The Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and the Tianfu Coal Mining Company held a memorial service for Mr. Zhang Xinfu on the 27th. More than 200 people attended, including members of the Institute of Engineers such as Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, Zhang Jia'ao, and Shen Yi, senior figures in the mining and metallurgical industry such as Wu Renzhi, Zeng Zhen of the Chongqing Alumni Association of Peking University, as well as people from the industrial sector and representatives from various academic groups. Weng Wenhao presided over the ceremony and read three eulogies. Cao Chengke then reported on Zhang's biography, Liu Mengxi reported on the circumstances of his martyrdom, and Zhang Jia'ao delivered a supplementary speech.</p>

<h3>Our Authorities in Changchun Host Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Tea Party Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th] Today is the third day since the foreign reporters arrived in Changchun. They said: "For the past two days, we have been confined to a small room, and although we are bored, there is nothing we can do. Today, we moved about on the streets, and although we could not see the whole city, we felt a little more comfortable." They had requested an audience with Marshal Malinovsky, but were unable to meet him due to his busy schedule. In the afternoon, they visited Dong Yanping, the head of the military delegation, and Zhao Junmai, the mayor of Changchun. It is said that the military delegation will hold a tea party on March 1st to entertain them. It is not yet decided whether they will go to Harbin.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops from the Northeast are Underway in Moscow; We Will Send a Large Army to Strengthen the Takeover</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Chongqing News: It is learned that our government has decided to send an army of 300,000 to the Northeast to strengthen the takeover work. There are currently about 60,000 National Army troops in the Northeast. 200,000 troops will continue to be transferred from various regions. 100,000 National Army troops from Shanghai, Qingdao and other places are awaiting transportation to the north.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The number of Soviet troops in the Northeast has recently increased rather than decreased. An official source who recently returned from Changchun told a reporter that it is difficult to buy cigarettes in Changchun because a large number of Soviet officers have come east from Europe, and the cigarettes in Changchun have almost been entirely distributed to the Soviet officers. Officials have indicated that negotiations on demanding the Soviet Union's withdrawal of troops are underway in Moscow, but it is still difficult to predict whether they will succeed. This is because our side hopes that the Soviet Union will first fulfill its treaty obligations to withdraw troops before discussing issues outside the treaty. The Soviet side, however, intends to first determine its economic interests in the Northeast before discussing the withdrawal of troops, and its demands for economic interests seem quite insistent. It is said that when Chiang Ching-kuo visited the Soviet Union last time, the Soviet authorities said to him that the Soviet Union's interpretation and handling of war booty in the Northeast was the same as that implemented in Eastern European countries, and it was not unique to Northeast China. Therefore, the entanglement of economic issues may not be easily resolved. On the other hand, the Soviet Union seems to regard "time" as its useful friend, because if the Soviet side is given another two or three months, they can calmly digest their war booty in the Northeast and support forces that are more pro-Soviet than the Nationalist government. For this reason, the situation in the Northeast is like malaria, with alternating chills and fever. The takeover work in the Northeast is currently at a standstill. Chairman Gao Xibing of Andong has not yet taken office. Chairman Wu Huanzhang of Xing'an and Mayor Shen Yi of Dalian turned back halfway. Chairman Wu Hantao of Hejiang and Chairman Han Junjie of Heilongjiang are still staying in their Harbin residences, sleeping in their clothes every night, so they are covered in lice. The takeover personnel in Changchun and Harbin are currently deeply troubled by the dilemma of advancing or retreating. Although the Changchun Railway Council has been established, the real power belongs to the Soviet side. It is said that three-quarters of the Soviet staff are Red Army officers who have changed professions. The takeover of factories and mines in the Northeast has also been suspended since Zhang Xinfu's sacrifice. However, it is said that our side will not concede any factories and mines south of the former Chinese Eastern Railway (from Manzhouli to Suifenhe), while Soviet capital and technology can be discussed and accommodated in the northeastern region of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In general, people judge that General Bai Chongxi's visit to Beiping is not for the purpose of inspecting the army, but for reviewing the military situation in the north with Xiong Shihui, Li Zongren, and Du Yuming. This shows the central authorities' concern and emphasis on the north.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Minister of State Baker stated in the House of Commons yesterday, in response to a question from Conservative MP Savory: "The Chinese and Soviet governments are negotiating the date of the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in Manchuria. For this reason, I am unable to make any announcement at this time."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th, United Press] It appears that the Soviet troops in the Northeast intend to stay for a long time. 30,000 to 40,000 new Soviet troops have arrived at Port Arthur. This is reinforcement, not troop rotation, to support the existing Soviet troops, and they are now being assigned to various garrisons in the Northeast, including Dalian and Harbin.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Change of Jurisdiction of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands</h3>
<p>On the 20th of this year, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order incorporating South Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands into the Soviet Union's territory. At the same time, transportation, banks, enterprises, public utilities, and transportation equipment in the area were nationalized. Thus, what was once regarded as an obstacle to the Soviet Union's access to the Pacific Ocean has been completely eliminated, and the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands have officially changed their jurisdiction to the Soviet Union, becoming part of the Soviet Far East. On the 26th of the same month, US Secretary of State Byrnes made some remarks on this matter at a press conference in Washington, D.C., stating: "The United States accepts the obligations of the agreement and has agreed to support the transfer of this territory to the Soviet Union. When treaties are concluded in the future, he will insist that the United States should fulfill its promise and include clauses in the treaty incorporating the aforementioned territory into the Soviet Union's territory." Thus, the Soviet Union's annexation of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands is not only an accomplished fact, but also has the support of the US government. At a time when the gloom in Northeast China awaits clearing and international disputes await resolution, the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands may not have attracted much attention from the world. However, this annexation not only allows Soviet power to penetrate deep into the Pacific Ocean, but also creates a new situation in the entire Pacific region. Our country, located on the west coast of the Pacific, should pay close attention to this new situation in the Pacific. Regarding the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands, we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>First, the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands was originally based on the Yalta Agreement. Even though the Yalta Agreement involved the participation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it cannot be regarded as having general international binding force. Furthermore, it was a secret agreement, and the agreement concerning the transfer of land is, in its nature, close to a private transaction, with no legal basis. Regarding the disposition of Japanese-owned land, unless acquired through aggression, it should be transferred only with the unanimous approval and support of the countries that fought against Japan, especially the major countries that fought against Japan. Our country has fought against Japan for the longest time and has made the greatest sacrifices. It should have the right to inquire about how to dispose of Japanese land. China did not participate in the Yalta Conference, and the agreement reached at Yalta has no binding force on China. Therefore, we should reserve the right to make demands regarding the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands based on the Yalta Agreement. In today's prevailing "power politics," we must raise the legal significance of this issue so that the spirit of the rule of law can be seen in international actions and international order can be maintained.</p>
<p>Second, Sakhalin Island was under Chinese jurisdiction during the Ming Dynasty. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yongle managed the border areas, and his power extended to the area around the mouth of the Heilongjiang River in present-day eastern Siberia. He also established garrisons. Sakhalin Island and the area around the mouth of the Heilongjiang River are separated by a strait, and in winter, it freezes over. Ming troops managed this area, and there are historical records to prove it. The fact that this island has a Chinese name shows that it was under Chinese jurisdiction. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Treaty of Nerchinsk ceded the area around the Outer Khingan Mountains to Russia. Thus, China's relationship with Sakhalin was severed. From a historical point of view, China cannot remain silent about the change of jurisdiction of Sakhalin Island.</p>
<p>However, what prevails today is the era of "power politics." What our country is concerned about is that the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands has caused a new disturbance in the balance of power in the Pacific Ocean and created a new situation in the Pacific. What is this new situation? It is that the Soviet Union now occupies a dominant position in the North Pacific. Since Peter the Great's efforts to develop Russia, its consistent desire has been to go to sea, to have an ocean. In Europe, this desire has been blocked, and in Asia and the Far East, it has also been blocked occasionally. Now that the Kuril and Sakhalin Islands have changed their jurisdiction to the Soviet Union, it occupies a controlling position in the Pacific, especially the North Pacific. The Kuril Islands face the Aleutian Islands of North America; the Aleutian Islands were once occupied by Japanese troops. Tsar Peter the Great's dream has been realized under Chairman Stalin, who opposes Tsarism. Having achieved their long-cherished wish, the emotions of the Soviet people are not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The leakage of atomic energy secrets in Canada, the lingering gloom in Northeast China, and the balance of power in the North Pacific have changed. After the lessons of Pearl Harbor, humanity should have a new awakening. We hope that the Pacific Ocean can be peaceful for a long time!</p>
<h3>Sino-French New Treaty Signed Yesterday: France Returns Concessions and Renounces Privileges in China; Chinese Troops in Vietnam to Withdraw by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] The Sino-French Treaty on the Renunciation by France of Extraterritorial Rights in China and Related Privileges, and the Sino-French Agreement on Vietnam were signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 28th. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, represented China, and M. Meyrier, the French Ambassador to China, represented France. Those present included Gan Naiguang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Qin Dechun, Vice Chief of the Military Operations Department; Wang Huacheng, Wu Nanru, and Li Jun, Directors of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and secretaries and military attachés from the French Embassy. After the ceremony, Minister Wang and the French Ambassador shared champagne, congratulating each other. Several important outstanding issues between China and France have thus been resolved. It is generally believed that the traditional friendship between the two countries will be further strengthened in the future. The main points of the signed documents are as follows: (A) The Sino-French Treaty on the Renunciation by France of Extraterritorial Rights in China and Related Privileges is generally similar in content to the Sino-American and Sino-British New Treaties. It stipulates: (1) France formally renounces consular jurisdiction in China and the rights granted by the former Boxer Protocol, and agrees to return the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the Amoy International Settlement, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to the Chinese government. (2) France renounces all rights regarding special courts in the treaty ports in China, the Amoy International Settlement, and the French Concession in Shanghai; employing foreign pilots in various ports within Chinese territory; French warships entering Chinese territorial waters; French ships engaging in coastal trade and inland navigation within Chinese territorial waters; and requesting the appointment of French citizens in Chinese postal agencies. (B) The Sino-French Agreement on Sino-Vietnamese Relations stipulates: (1) Regarding the treatment of overseas Chinese, Chinese people in Vietnam shall continue to enjoy all the rights they have historically enjoyed in Vietnam, and the taxes they pay shall not be heavier than those paid by the Vietnamese people. Regarding legal procedures and judicial matters, they shall enjoy the same treatment as French people. (2) Regarding international transit, the French government agrees to provide all necessary facilities for the transit of Chinese goods in Haiphong port. Chinese goods transported from the Sino-Vietnamese border to Haiphong via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway shall be exempt from customs duties and shall be free to transit. Chinese goods passing through the Vietnamese railway shall be exempt from all transit taxes. (3) Regarding the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the 1903 Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Agreement shall be repealed from the date of signing of this agreement. The section of the railway within Chinese territory, that is, the section from Kunming to Hekou, shall be completely transferred to the Chinese government, and the Chinese government shall redeem it. The amount to be paid shall be advanced by the French government to compensate for the material losses suffered by the Chinese government and people due to the suspension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the blockade of Haiphong port due to Japanese interference in 1940. France shall request payment of this advance from Japan. Regarding the improvement of railway transportation between China and Vietnam, the French side declares that it will submit a concrete plan in the near future. (C) Regarding the exchange of notes on Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, France declares that it is prepared to assume full responsibility for managing Japanese prisoners of war in northern Vietnam, maintaining local order, and protecting overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese government has decided to complete the transfer of defense by the Chinese troops before March 31 of this year and withdraw immediately.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement: Hopes Vietnamese Disputes Can Be Resolved Fairly</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] After the signing of various agreements between China and France today, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement: Northern Vietnam is within the Chinese war zone. Therefore, at the request of the Allied Supreme Command, the Chinese government sent troops to Vietnam to accept the surrender of Japan. Now that the disarmament of Japanese troops has been completed, and the French authorities are prepared to send troops to the area, the Chinese government is deeply concerned about the internal disputes in Vietnam. However, it is undeniable that the Chinese people sympathize with the Vietnamese national movement. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the disputes among the relevant parties in Vietnam can be resolved fairly. What we especially hope is that all parties can avoid bloodshed and reach a resolution. If such a fair and peaceful resolution is achieved, it will not only greatly benefit the Vietnamese people, but also have a very positive impact on the resolution of similar incidents in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 28th] After the signing of the Sino-French New Treaty on the 28th, reporters interviewed French Ambassador M. Meyrier, who made the following remarks: The treaty we just signed should be regarded as an epoch-making standard in the history of Sino-French diplomacy. These treaties have cleared up some past realities and difficulties, and have designed other agreements yet to be signed, and are themselves the seeds of new agreements. I deeply hope that in the near future, I can negotiate with the Chinese government these agreements that respect sovereignty and conform to the principles of modern international law, so as to promote close cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as culture and science. The spirit of mutual assistance shown by both sides during this negotiation is the best guarantee of the sincere cooperation between the Chinese and French people that we expect in the post-war reconstruction process. The future achievements of Asia also bring us a bright omen. On the solid foundation of Sino-French friendship, I am confident that a cornerstone of a new building has been laid today.</p>
<h3>Territory Not Yet Fully Recovered: Eastern Mongolian Autonomy Not Discussed; Representatives' Trip to Chongqing Called Off</h3>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 27th] The Eastern Mongolian representatives' trip to Chongqing is likely to be called off. Although they still hope to go to Chongqing, Mani Badara and others have stated that the issue of Eastern Mongolian autonomy can only be considered after the country has fully recovered the Northeast. At present, the territory has not been recovered, so there is no point in talking about autonomy. When Vice Chief of Staff Bai was in Beiping, the relevant authorities convened a meeting to discuss the Eastern Mongolian issue and made a decision.</p>
<p>[Tianjin, United Press, 28th] It is heard that after meeting with General Xiong Shihui, Mani Badara has cancelled his plan to go to Chongqing. He now intends to fly to Changchun and then return to Hailar. It has also been announced by the Central Government that the name "Inner Mongolia" will no longer be used, but a more appropriate alternative name has not yet been given.</p>
<h3>Allocation of National Ships: Establishment of Nanjing Branch</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 28th] In order to adapt to the reconstruction and transportation plan, the National Ship Allocation Association has recently decided to establish a Nanjing branch. It has designated the building opposite Wharf No. 4 on the Xiaguan Jiangbian as the address of the association. It will start operating tomorrow.

The employers did not agree and requested arbitration by the municipal government. In order to uphold the decision of the Bureau of Social Affairs and request the Arbitration Committee of the Municipal Government to arbitrate impartially, the workers gathered on Shandong Road at 10:00 AM yesterday and set off to petition the municipal government. Three representatives carried the petition to meet with the mayor, who dispatched Counselor Wang Zhuyi, and Sun Jinch, the director of the Arbitration Committee, to receive them. Zhou Xuexiang, the acting chairman of the Trade Union Federation, also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and offered words of comfort, promising to handle the matter impartially. The representatives then left and led the team to disperse on Jinling Road via Sichuan Middle Road, Nanjing Road, and Tibet Road. Despite the harsh wind and rain, their spirits remained high during the march.</p>

<h3>Eighteen Japanese War Criminals Sentenced; Five to be Hanged</h3>
<p>Only One Consulate Policeman Acquitted</p>
<p>The eighteen Japanese war criminals who murdered three American airmen in Hankow were sentenced yesterday by the U.S. Military War Crimes Tribunal at Tilanqiao Prison. At 8:30 AM, Colonel Middleton and other members of the five-member committee handling the case arrived. The court convened at 9:30 AM. The criminals sat quietly in their seats, the atmosphere tense. Colonel Middleton then read the verdict. The charges against the criminals were threefold: (1) torturing three American airmen, forcing them to parade through the streets as a public spectacle; (2) brutally murdering the three American airmen, putting them to death; (3) participating in the above two items, and participating in planning and actions, relating to the entire development.

The entire process took only twenty minutes. The Japanese war criminals, under the escort of military police, bowed and withdrew. The executions of the criminals will be carried out after the approval of General Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Outside Traders Take Advantage of Low Prices, Yarn Market Sentiment Stabilizes, Raw Cotton Transactions Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of recovery, mainly because the continuous decline in prices had been significant. Outside traders, who had been observing for several days, took advantage of the low prices to absorb supplies, causing prices to rebound by 40,000 to 70,000. The sixteen-count Guangming yarn, which has a "rubber ball" characteristic, initially fell to 830,000 but then rebounded to 890,000. Market sentiment at the close stabilized, and the trend was flat. The Textile Construction Company continued to sell various counts of cotton yarn at reduced prices yesterday to meet the needs of the factories. It is reported that cotton cloth will be sold at reduced prices today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be weak, and transactions decreased significantly. The yarn and cloth market was weak, and the price cuts by manufacturers were very deep, making negotiations difficult. The Textile Construction Company was also watching and had not made any purchases. In addition, only Shenxin No. 6 Mill, a private yarn factory, had a slight demand for two to three hundred bales of sixteen-count raw material "fire engine flower," with prices down by one to two thousand compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>There were people trying to cover short positions by buying at lower prices, with the price reaching 1,420,000 yuan, and even reaching 1,450,000 yuan at its highest. Later, due to rumors that the exchange rate for the US dollar would be 1,000 to one, and reports that the authorities would soon list gold, sentiment softened, and bulls sold off. The price fell to as low as 1,370,000 yuan at one point. Around 11:00 AM, northern traders entered the market to cover, and the price rebounded to 1,400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market continued to soften, with few buyers at 1,380,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were weaker than in the previous session due to the continued decline in gold prices and softening sentiment, with buyers watching. The US dollar fell to around 2,000 yuan, and Hong Kong dollar old bills were 370 yuan, with new bills down 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern Traders Absorb Consolidated Bonds</h3>
<p>Trading in consolidated bonds has gradually started to pick up quietly, with northern traders showing strong interest. All bonds are rising, with Type C rising to 1,700 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous session. Types A and B rose by 100 yuan, Type D followed up by 150 yuan, and Type E rose by 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Idle Funds Seek Opportunities, Stock Market Shows Activity Again</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks have fallen for many days, but yesterday saw a sudden rebound. Many retail investors closed out positions, and with gold and cash trending sluggishly, some idle funds flowed back into the stock market. Trading in the unofficial market was quite active. With demand exceeding supply, all stocks were strong. Wing On Textile Mill rose to 2,500 yuan, finally closing at 2,450 yuan. Mei Feng even reached the 2,000 yuan mark. Jingfu had few transactions, but the trend was firm. New Kwong rose by more than 20%, and Kun Hing rose by 10 yuan, continuing to rise in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were strong due to strong buying from those with idle funds. Jardine Textile Mill rose by 100 yuan, Wheelock Marden rose by 1,500 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose by 300 yuan. Paper and shipping stocks each rose by 50 yuan, and most others were firm.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Spring Sales Begin, Local Businesses are in Good Spirits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of woolen cloth on this street were lively, as spring sales continued to gain momentum. There was a surge in selection and purchase of men's and women's clothing in Western and Chinese styles. Generally, business owners, seeing that the outlet is widening day by day, have had an increase in appetite. For example, Xin Da Xiang, Xie Da Xiang, Kuan Da Xiang, Li Yu Xiang, and the four major companies all have strong appetites. Clothing traders in Szechuan Road, Avenue Joffre, Daxin Street, and Jing'an Temple Road all made considerable purchases. The standard prices at the public tea party were high because salt inventories were lacking, and the Central Textile Company's offerings were mostly thick fabrics and lacked thin fabrics. The prices were not very cheap compared to the market price, and they were not widely available. In addition, the crazy rise in yellow and white goods and various other environmental factors have caused the prices of all kinds of men's and women's colored, lustrous, coarse, and fine woolens to rise across the board.</p>
<h3>Silk Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Artificial silk has fallen by 500,000 yuan in four days. At the 120-day Tianqiao spot market, the opening price was 1,900,000 yuan, and the closing price was 1,750,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it traded at 1,770,000 yuan. Semi-gloss increased by 100,000 yuan, and matte was even more expensive, with transactions at over 2,300,000 yuan. Factory silk prices were weak, and trading was very familiar. Five-dan head silk from Jiangjing was bid at 1,500,000 yuan, but the counteroffer of 1,400,000 yuan did not result in a transaction. Silk fabrics were slightly softer, with Mei Ya bedspreads down 10,000 yuan from the previous day, Da Cheng lattice crepe down 100 yuan, and Minsheng brocade down 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The rice market was slightly active yesterday due to the rainy weather, and prices rose by 1,000 yuan. Flour from Qingdao and Ningbo had good demand, and prices rose by 100 to 200 yuan. Soybeans also rose by 300 to 500 yuan, and the oil market followed, rising by nearly 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes rose slightly by 100 yuan, while bran was flat and weak, down nearly 100 yuan. Raw peanuts remained stable, with the various grains showing signs of hovering at noon.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Sluggish</h3>
<p>The volume of red and green tea transactions has not yet increased. Buyers, seeing that prices in the city have been declining in recent days, are trying to suppress prices, but sellers are waiting for better prices as inventories dwindle. Therefore, although negotiations are still taking place, they are difficult to reach an agreement, and only sporadic transactions are occurring, making the market firm and quiet. Prices are stable and unchanged. Yesterday, West Lake Longjing was sold at 2,400,000 yuan, Zhuji black tea at 72,000 yuan, and Huangshan Jasmine at 140,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Summary of Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet all day, and the Rong traders remained in a wait-and-see attitude. In the afternoon, there was a slight improvement.</p>
<p>The sugar market has been firm for a long time. Medium sugar is flat and sluggish due to the need for local taxes for cotton white exports. The market is stable. Taiwanese white sugar is still firm. Qingchi inventory is not large, and it is quite active due to northern traders. The market is quite firm.</p>
<p>Sales of cotton textiles are sluggish and transactions are quiet. The industry is speculating about the exchange rate and prices have fallen again. However, the price of Sanju men's socks was too low yesterday, and retail investors rushed to buy them, so the market has slightly recovered.</p>
<p>Daily necessities are sluggish due to continuous rainy days. Beautiful matches are in short supply and prices are lively. The rest are turning weak.</p>
<p>The cigarette market opened with weak sentiment. Except for Old Knife, China Merchants Da Mei Li, which were slightly firm, the rest were consistently downstream.</p>
<p>Western medicine continued to fall yesterday. Local households are selling a lot, but household medicines are still at the original price due to strong sales.</p>
<p>There are too few Kolapay goods for stationery, and the market is generally out of stock. Transactions are lonely due to the end of the month. Generally, the psychology is to wait and see.</p>
<p>China Standard Weaving Factory produces standard brand handkerchiefs. It has a long history. Due to environmental influences during the war, it temporarily stopped working. After the victory, it greatly expanded and carefully reorganized, and now it has resumed production.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>On a winter night, we walked into a tavern and chose a seat by the window facing the street. The weather was very cold, as if it were about to snow. The street lamps emitted a faint light. This street was usually quite prosperous, but today it seemed unusually desolate. The few pedestrians who were there also hurried past with their heads shrunk.</p>
<p>So many years of separation had made us both quiet. How big the world is 　is hard to believe. Just yesterday, we ran into each other on the street. It was so sudden. He had just come from the mountain city. He told me that he couldn't believe that I had been staying in this bustling city for so long.</p>
<p>We seemed to have a lot to say. Six years apart, the changes of these long years 裘 were really too great, but we didn't seem to know where to start. Time was too short, after all. He said that he would be leaving here tomorrow. We could only sit face to face, looking at each other, letting the sake be poured into our stomachs cup by cup.</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering something, he asked me,</p>
<p>"Are you married?"</p>
<p>"No," I said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Then, at least a little romance?"</p>
<p>I still shook my head at him. He seemed very disappointed. It was as if he was saying, how have I been spending these days?</p>
<p>I asked him in return: "What about you?"</p>
<p>Hearing my question, a layer of 　 brilliant light swept across his face. His tone seemed to be 　cheerful as well. He looked very satisfied 　.</p>
<p>"I can't be like you. I'm already married, and soon we'll be having a baby!" Saying that, he took out a photo from his pocket and said:</p>
<p>"Here, I'll give it to you! Look, my wife is pretty good, right? Two big eyes. We've known each other for three years. She's still in college."</p>
<p>"A happy man," I toasted him, and he quickly took it and drank it all in one gulp.</p>
<p>His temperament was still so cheerful. He laughed heartily after drinking a lot of wine, and told me in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Even here, although it was only a few days, I had a little romance. That woman was really cute, but later she heard that I was married and ignored me."</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid your wife will be sad when she finds out?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing. We are very good. This is just acting on the stage. After so many years, everything has changed, but this old temper has not changed."</p>
<p>His words made us both laugh—I said to him:</p>
<p>"You haven't changed at all, you're still the same."</p>
<p>"You too."</p>
<p>This seemed to be our final mutual discovery. It was already very late. There were only a few people left in the tavern. We slipped onto the street. A gust of cold wind blew head-on, freezing people so that they shivered. We almost said at the same time:</p>
<p>"It's really cold."</p>
<h3>Mr. Tang Shouqing of Yushan's Figure Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>When it comes to Chinese figure painting, it seems that one immediately thinks of the "Cao clothing emerging from the water, Wu ribbons dancing in the wind" style of the ancient masters, with their brilliant styles. However, this style can only be understood from historical legends.</p>
<p>If we want to take a look at the works of the late Tang dynasty, such as Zhang Xuan's paintings of noble sons, Zhou 　's paintings of beautiful women, or Li Gonglin's white depictions of the Song dynasty, it is not easy to do so. Therefore, if one wants to explore the style of Chinese figure painting, perhaps one can only study the works of the masters of the Ming and Qing dynasties.</p>
<p>Examining the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties and earlier, figure paintings were mostly dominated by Taoist and Buddhist themes. It was not until the Ming dynasty that we could see three trends: Taoist and Buddhist, historical customs, and portraiture. However, as for the Taoist and Buddhist category, Xu Qin said in his "Ming Dynasty Painting Records": "Modern masters can neither specialize in this field, but falsely claim that they disdain it. Confucian temples and Buddhist monasteries are full of vulgar paintings, and there is nothing worth seeing." This is precisely pointing out its fate. Historical customs, on the other hand, were very developed, and Qiu Shizhou was a representative writer. He was not only beautiful, charming, meticulous, and exquisite, but also used ancient methods in many ways, with originality. The Southern Chen and Northern Cui of the late Ming dynasty were also great masters. Chen Hongshou's style tended towards strangeness and antiquity, while Cui Zizhong pursued lofty elegance, establishing a solid foundation for the style of the Ren brothers of the Qing dynasty. As for portraiture, Zeng Bochen of Minzhong was the representative at that time. Although it was still popular in the Qing dynasty, it lacked the unique artistic charm of China.</p>
<p>During the three hundred years of the Qing dynasty, the development of figure painting was really only in the category of historical customs. Within this category, we can further divide it into two major sections, namely, customs and stories, and ladies. The former was still centered on the style of Qiu Ying and Chen Cui. The Qiu school was most popular during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, and later developed into independent paintings of ladies. The works of Gai Qixiang and Fei Xiaolou during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods were pure, elegant, and detached from the world, and can be truly regarded as excellent. The latter reached its peak in the late Qing dynasty.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Shouqing of Wu Yu is a loyal writer who loves the art of figure painting. He spent more than 20 years of his efforts, just in the style of modern figure painting center under hard work, often to Qiu, Gai, Fei, the scale of the home to find clues, hard thinking, imitation, carefully set ink, carefully color, in these many precious time, accumulated these works, on the style, not only beautiful, but also elegant, not only meticulous, but also rigorous, is an artistic worshiper, we to his first exhibition in the youth association, should be given another look.</p>
<h3>At the End of the Year of Yimao, I Traveled with Friends on the French Riviera for Five Days, Sending My Sentiments to Shi Zhaoji in Paris</h3>
<p>— Jin Wensi</p>
<p>Kunming Pond has changed and the bamboo forest is joyful, the gatherings and dispersions are hasty, almost like orchids; the waves on the beach are vast and powerful, the palm trees fall in the sunset, the sea and mountains are cold. I cherish Liu Yi's ambition on the distant bed, and I beg to place the common people under Xie An's care; the victory or defeat of the remaining chess game is the responsibility of both, I look forward to working hard and urging you to add to your meal.</p>
<h3>Rhyming in Response to Envoy Jin Wensi</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhao</p>
<p>How can five days of lingering be all joy? I know that you regret the parting as the year comes to an end; the rivers and mountains are still beautiful in the smoke and clouds, the vast sea is turbulent and the wind and snow are cold. I still have a letter to comfort me, and I still pity the lonely traveler in Chang'an; when will I meet you again? Don't laugh at people's talk about eating a free meal.</p>
<h3>Double Flying (17)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Old Mr. Weng not only predicted what happened to Mr. Mo, but also predicted what happened to himself. In the same winter that Mrs. Mo gave birth to Lihua, Mrs. Weng II also gave birth to a daughter. Moreover, his daughter and Mr. Mo's daughter, as expected, became good friends, just like their mothers. Because of this, his daughter's name was also given to her by Mr. Mo, called Liyun.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo blushed with shame, and he slapped the table hard, wanting to say something, but swallowed it back.</p>
<p>"Besides, boys should study, that's right; what's the use of girls studying? Anyway, you don't have good intentions, you just want to find a way to bully me." Mrs. Mo said, and also slapped the table hard.</p>
<p>The children felt very uneasy and also ridiculous because of their parents' quarrel! At the same time, it could not reduce the children's closeness to Mr. Mo, and they naturally needed to be with Mr. Mo often, because their desire for knowledge could not be satisfied by Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo was proud of this, and he was happy for this pride! He had never had this kind of experience in his life. Because he had never had anything in his life that was worth being proud of.</p>
<p>"Shaohua, I'm really happy! You don't ignore me because of your mother."</p>
<p>After Mr. Mo quarreled with Mrs. Mo, Mrs. Mo forcibly pulled Lihua away from Mr. Mo, but in the blink of an eye, Lihua quietly returned to Mr. Mo's side. Therefore, Mr. Mo said to 　hua with relief.</p>
<p>Lihua smiled and leaned against Mr. Mo, without saying anything.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo hugged Lihua tightly. A wave of victorious joy made him forget the unhappiness just now, and even forget the worries of the past years. He told Lihua a story about a dream. He told the story of the strange dream he had seven years ago, the night before Lihua was born, in a vivid and colorful way.</p>
<p>Lihua listened quietly, like listening to an interesting myth. She didn't understand what this myth had to do with her, and she never thought that this myth faintly foretold her life.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Mo made a conclusion on Old Mr. Weng's explanation. He fondly stroked Lihua's head and said:</p>
<p>"What your Uncle Weng said was completely accurate. You and I, father and daughter, are indeed destined! You really like Daddy. You smiled the first time you saw Daddy! You are really the apple of Daddy's eye!"</p>
<p>Lihua smiled again. This time, she burst out laughing! Because of her laughter, Mr. Mo recalled the memory of seven years ago—she laughed the same way as when she had just landed on the ground, she laughed like the clear singing of the oriole in the dream!</p>
