<h3>馬使短期內返國說不確　五人會談今續舉行　雙方均將提出具體意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕政府與中共代表臨時組成之五人商談會，今日雙方曾竟日是研討有關關內外共車撞退地區之一切善後問題。聞雙方已約定明日下下四時變演會議。據中立人士說：明日國共代表會談時，雙方對各項問題，將提出較具體之意見，以便商討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國共商談目前又因定期召開國民大會而遭遇新的困難，因中共堅持必須由政協會議決定，且認為較蘇北之行政權更形重要，政府方面則認覺應以既定方針按步進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國共直接商談，今日雙方均在分別研討中，惟據聞雙方均仍堅持原議，無任何新的意見。周恩來曾於今日下午五時半往訪馬帥，至將近七時始返。談話內容乃就昨日會談內容告馬帥，並涉及召開國民大會問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕確思：美駐華特使馬歇爾，因任務未了，現時不致返美，日前京滬少數報紙所載馬使擬於短期內返美一說，絕對不確。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕據馬歇爾將軍語本報記者云：關於外電所傳本人擬於短期內返美一說，渠本人尚未作此決定。準此以觀，所謂馬使使倦勤一訊，誠無稽之談。又遽本報記者探悉：馬使能否於短期內赴北平一行，現尚未定，但如國共直接談判對有關停戰整軍各問題獲有成就，馬使為減少中國人民痛苦計，則不辭　暑長征，隨時可至軍北及東北一行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕馬歇爾特使來華已半載，將留至何時乎？此一問題，今日成為難產的和平談判之陰影。截至目前為止，唯一答案，則為馬使不能無限期留駐中國。今日多數觀察家相信，中國之永久和平，路途遙遙，與馬使初抵重慶時無異。政府宣布本年十一月十二日召開國民大會，除非在此日期以前成立協定，中共或將再度拒絕參加。馬使一旦提早返國，選任適當鑑任人之困難乃為另一實質的問題。前任中國方面美軍司令魏德邁即將重來中國，以其對於中國之認識而論，自有充分續任資格，但事實上中共對之未必滿意。馬使行館絕未暗示馬使對於促成中國和平已萌些微退志，馬使本人對中共領袖或國府領袖之威望，亦絕無減弱，協助馬使談判者相信，和平一綫希望尚存，馬使當留任以完成其使命。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕民主同盟代表羅隆薩與　漱溟今日曾訪吳鐵城，主張政協綜合小組應即舉行會議，解決各項懸案。周恩來·董必武，定明日與陳誠·邵力子·王世杰舉行第三次會議討論國民大會問題，周夫人鄧願超已於今日赴滬，小住數日。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京五日電〕某國民黨高級官員本日聲稱：關於肇軍問題，政府方面希望與共方於一週或十日獲至協定。惟並非暗示政府方面限期解決該項問題之意。</p>
<h3>國大留京代表　發表宣言　人民期待政府救助　國共問題亟應解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕國民大會留京代表委員會今日發表宣言稱：休戰及和平談判均應有一期限，政府不應採取中日戰事前之不侵犯態度，抱人不犯我，我不犯人主義。目前情形已與中日戰事開始時不同，當時因日本侵略我國領土，故我國起而『抗戰』，今日共產黨佔據土地甚廣，遍及國內各處，設雙方均採不侵犯態度，是否即係政府對共產黨在其佔領之地位已予承認。政府於六月三十休戰聲明中曾言，希望馬歇爾特使繼續調解，以謀和平解決，但吾人應憶及馬使調解業經半載於茲，而和平仍末有望，吾人頸質問政府，究將談判至何時為止、中國難民今日有數百萬，共產黨統治下之人民遭遇更苦，人民現均期待政府救助，一如嬰兒之仰望其母，政府不惟不援救人民反進行遲緩之談判，政府亦知消費於談判中之每一小時，即有甚多無辜人民慘遭死亡乎。政府所提之三項要求，如永久解放初期戰，恢復交通及整頓軍隊，統未於址五日休戰期內及延長休戰期內解決，政府雖命令必須解決，但至今既未有具體解決辦法，亦未獲原則上之協議，如政府對其所提要求無甚把握，發言即不應如此堅强。請政府將談判經過予以公佈，並宣佈其將來態度，俾使人民決定誰是誰非。民主國家，無秘密外交，吾人內政上寗可有秘密外交乎？</p>
<h3>主席召見盧作孚</h3>
<p>聽取觀察美航業報告</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕蔣主席今下午五時，召見最近由美視察航業歸來之民生航業公司總經理盧作孚，聽取盧氏視察美國航業之報告，並有所垂詢。</p>
<h3>參政員蘇珽等　請裁撤糧食部</h3>
<p>澈懲京滬路局舞弊案</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕參政會駐會委員會於今日第五次會議中，通過各案：（一）蘇珽等提請政府迅即裁撤糧食部案，決議原案修正通過。（二）傅斯年等撤請政府澈懲京淤泥　滬杭路局購料貪污人員，並嘉獎檢舉人員案，決議送請政府切實辦理。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕王部長雲五今日在參政會駐會委員會報告最近經濟設施情形。王氏報告着重經濟部掖收，及處理工作之檢討，與今後之計畫。王氏對中紡公司現狀表示『相當滿意』。</p>
<h3>國大籌備工作　早經辦理竣事　籌委會秘書長談話</h3>
<p>〔中共社南京五日電〕國民大會召開日期業經國防最高委會決議，定本年十一月十二日召開。記者為明瞭大會籌備情形，特走訪國民大會籌委會洪秘長　友，據談籌備工作前以應五五開會之重要，早經在部規劃或辦理竣事，在率令延展期間，籌委會因大會有隨時召開之可能，一切工作雖分別緊縮，但並未停頓，現開會日期重率決定，就過去準備基礎，再加今後四個月之時間，當可妥定進度，使各部門工作更求充實，以期於開會前　籌滿之事務益臻完善。</p>
<h3>東北行營　有改組說</h3>
<p>李宗仁將出發視察</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕李宗仁將於日內赴平漢路各要點及晋綏視察，預定行期約一週。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕世界日報今日載瀋陽消息稱：東北行營將改組為經濟·軍事·及政治三委員會，行營主任熊式軍將任政治委員會主席，杜聿明仍任東北保安司令，張嘉務及胡宗南分任經濟及軍事委員會主席。</p>
<h3>何應欽發表談話　對國際局勢甚感樂觀　我國應全力從事建設</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯合國安全理事會軍事團中國代表團團長兼中國駐美軍代表團長何應欽，四日夜間乘凱旋號專車，由京抵滬，昨接見中央社記者稱，全世界人士現正渴望實現永久和平，中國為愛好和平之國家，極願與美英蘇法諸國共同為促進世界和平而努力，人人心理既無戰爭準備，戰爭是無由發生，故余對國際局勢，甚感樂觀。談及國內問題，何氏稱：政府向本一貫主張，以政治方式解決一切問題，祇要大家真正以國家民族利益為前提，任何事項，均必能獲得和平解決之途徑。八年來在蔣主席賢明領導之下，完成抗戰勝利，今後自應盡全力從事建設，加緊復員工作。記者叩詢何氏對本國軍事教育今後宜如何改善，渠稱：要建設一現代化之國家，必需有現代化之軍隊，現代化之軍事教育；需興工業·交通·各方建設配合發展，所謂『富國强兵』而後始能『國富兵强』。關於東北建設部份，何氏就視察印象所得，認為東北雖經十四年淪陷，大部分工業基礎尚未全毀，倘不再經破壞，全國人士一致努力，則復興東北，建設東北，祇需要七年時間即可實現初步理想。最後，何氏肯定語記者，倘全國人士真正團結，一致努力，則中國與世界必能實現永久和平。何氏在滬現正辦理出國手續，一俟機位配定，即飛紐約赴任，行前如有餘暇，將舉行一次記者招待會。</p>

<h3>戴伯爾門飛哈晤林彪　商執行停戰辦法　林彪告記者將與杜聿明會晤　共軍撤離哈爾濱正在商談中</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕軍調部長春分部美代表戴伯爾門，由共方代表伍代鬰伴同於今日上午九時由長春專機去哈爾濱，中外記者各二人隨行，十時二十分抵哈機場，林彪及綞學詩李毓然等，均在機場歡迎，當驅車至共軍交際處之大廈休息片刻後，林戴會談一小時許，嗣林彪接見中外記者，渠承認將與杜聿明長官會晤於長春，但時間未定。渠對共軍撤離哈爾濱一地，認為中共並不同意，但具體問題，正在商談中。繼由戴伯爾門接見記者，表示此行目的，除欲一晤林彪外，並為以軍調部立場，商討如何執行停戰之辦法，繼即舉行午餐，四時許於大雨中，原機平安返長。</p>

<h3>共軍越平漢路西進　鄂北應山激戰中　企圖分路進攻襄樊桐棗</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕官方消息，共軍李先念部撤離光山一帶後，正謀越過平漢路，向西北挺進，觀其形勢，此舉意在纏伏牛山，北越黃河。他方豫北劉伯誠部，亦已發動大軍，進襄武陟修武等縣，而期接應李先念部北上。李部另一部則有經豫北　德北上，與魯南共軍合流之勢。共方對此之解釋，則為該部共軍係被國軍擊潰而分散。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕關係機關負責人告記者，軍調部鑒於光山地區共軍近有大規模移動，並已引起劇烈衝突，乃復將該方面共軍趕出駐防區域，不准再有移動，倘共軍再有移動，則引起之一切事件，應由共軍負責，該方面共軍共八個旅，現劃這地區為就共軍現狀而劃定，平漢路東豫北羅山光山間一百平方里，駐該部五個旅，另三個旅則限駐於平漢路西鄂境之應山附近，按此次駐地之限定，與二月間羅山協議之範圍已不同。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州五日電〕竄越平漢路西共軍，刻在應山以北夢家河·平青關·花山·泉口店一帶，及應山以南壽山平林市等處，應北方面係李先念指揮，應山南十五公里之分趙家棚，四日國軍與共軍發生戰鬥甚烈。據檢獲地圖所示，共軍擬竄桐柏山之天河口，及大洪山之洛陽店，觀其近日行動，似極吻合。應北共軍刻繼續西竄，應南共軍亦有西渡溳水模樣。</p>

<h3>新疆的新政</h3>
<p>新疆省政府各新任委員業於本月一日在迪化宣誓就職，中央特派監察院于院長前往監誓，對今後新疆省府寄予極大希望。于氏謂；今後新疆者府是民主政府，此後將不再有民族間之磨擦，全疆人民將永離黑暗戰爭與不自由的痛苦。據報傳消息，誓詞分為兩種：由兼主席張治中領導宣讀漢文誓詞，並由副主席阿合買提江喀司莫夫領導宣讀維吾爾文誓詞。此項宣誓典禮的舉行，代表着新疆新政的實施，實為一種劃期的舉措，其意義至為深長。我們願乘新疆的國大代表來滬之際，一述對亽今後新疆之期望。</p>
<p>新疆設省，始於清季。當時承亂變之後，主政的左語言襄，頗具才略，銳意圖治，一切施政，始定規模。左氏治新的方針，不問漢與回，只問亂不亂。此其意義，端在泯滅新疆各宗族間的仇恨，實為一種開明的民族政策。新疆一地，居民原極復雜，有當地的漢人，當地的漢回，土著的纏回，此即所謂維吾爾族，亦即元代的畏吾爾，唐代的回紇，此外，還及游牧的蒙古人，塔塔爾人，哈薩克人，烏孜別克人，柯爾吉斯人，塔什人等等。在一個區域內，居住着這許多宗族，自然容易引起爭端。辛亥革命以後，新疆以地處邊陲，中央鞭長莫及，新疆的施政多少形成一種地方割據軍閥統治的局面。其間變亂迭起，著名的有南疆之亂，直到最近還有所謂伊寧之變。自民國三十三年七月間伊寗發生糾紛以來，事態逐漸擴大，一時有組織所謂『東土耳其斯坦共和國』的謠傳，至去年九月，中央壬特派張治中將軍前往新疆，處理糾紛，旋又以張氏兼任新疆省政府主席，迭與伊寧代表進行商談，於本年一月二日在迪化簽訂伊寧糾紛事件和解條款正文十一條，同時復成立附文一件，又於本年六月六日成立附文第二件，經中央核准，於上月廿九日公布於南京。至是，新疆問題全部解決。</p>
<p>依據和解條款及附件，新疆省政府即進行改組。為期調協邊民，安定疆圍起見，新疆省府實行擴大組織，由各宗族代表共同參加，除主席由西北行營主任張治中兼理外，並設副主席二人，以塔塔爾族之鮑爾漢及維吾爾族之阿合買提江喀司莫夫分任之，秘書長一人，以廣東劉孟純任之，並設副秘書長兩人，以哈薩克族薩立士，維吾爾族阿布都克力木阿巴索夫分任之。此外，復設委員十九人，分由漢·漢回·維吾爾·蒙旗·哈薩克·烏孜別克·柯爾吉斯各族人士任之。其中民政廳長為漢人，另設副廳長一人為維吾爾人；財政廳長一人為漢人，另設副廳長一人為漢回；教育廳長一人為維吾爾人，副廳長一人為漢人；建設廳長一人為維吾爾人，副廳長一人為漢人；社會處長為漢人，副處長屬蒙旗；衛生處長一人為哈薩克人，不設副處長；迪化市長則由漢籍省委兼任。可知新疆有消息府經此次改組，各族均已參加。和解條款及附件，同時規定各族有自治選舉之權，政府取矄對於宗教之歧視，予人民以信仰宗教之完全自由，政府機關文書國文回文並用，人民並得單獨使用其本族文字，學校教育亦准用本族文字施教，但中學應以國文國必修科，政府確定民族文化與藝術之自由發展，參加事變之各族武裝部隊准參照國軍編制，編成步兵三個團，騎兵三個團；其中兩個騎兵團一個步兵團為國軍，餘者為地方保安部隊等等。</p>
<p>經過了這次改組，新疆進入了一個新時代，其特征為實現各宗族之自由平等。這是政府與民更始的一個顯明例證。查新疆在過去之所以糾紛時起，不外各宗族間互相猜忌，而主政者輒復不能顧全各宗族間之感情，善為調處，以致每因細故，釀成巨變。今政府本革命之三民主義處理邊政，用以協和各族，新疆問題得能澈底圓滿全部解決。三民主義之民族主義原有對對與對外的兩面，其對久方面在求中國民族之自由平等，對內，則求構成中國民族的各宗族之自由平等。本此精神，所以中國國民黨二中全會本年三月，開於陪都，對邊政有重要的決議，重申政府開明的民族政策。本報曾於三月廿一日著論有所評列，以為二中全會所決定的邊疆政策，不特足以表示對邊地同胞的關注，抑亦為他們此後的發展開拓了一條大道。現在我們看到新疆的新氣象，更加想念民族生義的的真理本來是顛撲不破，只要誠心實行，任何復雜問題都可得到解決。</p>
<p>這次新結新政的實施，根據二中全會的決議和主席的指示，足證政府對於保障邊疆各族的自治權利，具有決心。這是政治民主化，軍隊國家化的一個實例。此後新政展開，各宗族在自由平等携手協調的情況下，不特過去的猜忌嫉恨悉可泯除，且將在互助合作仁愛和平的信念下，更進而精誠團結，固我邊圍。如何修明政治，利用資源，發展交通，以及加緊邊省與內地的關係以建設新新疆，深信在張主席及各族委員協同的督導下，必能積極展開。對於張治中將軍之為了調處新疆問題，一再奔走斡旋，辛勞為國，我們尤所贊佩。新疆的新政是開始了，願這種和諧協調的精神，能够將新新疆建設起來，再將此協調精神進一步而普及於全國，將新中國建設起來！</p>

<h3>煤氣供不應求　計劃設立新廠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據英商自來火公司工程師施柏金斯氏昨日告記者稱，本市煤氣供應情形已呈恐慌。煤氣之消耗量，並不因天熱而减少。根據本年六月底之統計。平均每日消耗量三百八十一萬立方尺，較二月中旬統計，每日消耗量三百七十九萬八千立方尺，增加百分之〇·三一一，較一九四一年六月統計所得每日消耗量三百零五萬立方尺，則增加百分之二十五。施氏以為此種現象，皆為不應有者，現公司方面之生產情形，已達最高限度，且將入危險狀態。施氏又稱，煤氣現為上海最廉價之燃料，此燃料因價過廉，質地已不如戰前之純粹而有效。煤氣之原料，原多來自印度，坎拿大·美國·及華北·現因印度本地工業發達，需煤量大，美國則發生工潮，故上海存料已少，然公司方面已在盡力想法疏通船隻運煤來滬。此外並計劃設立新廠，惟最要者，則望市民合作，儘量减低消耗量，共同藏過此難關。</p>

<p>廿四届　國際合作節　獻詞　國際合作運動　現階段底新任務  陳仲明　　一切發展　段底　历史桂规律性之把握，是一切歷史課題之論究的前提。當這民主政治戰勝獨裁政治。聯合國重建世界和平基礎的今天，全世界二萬個不分種族不分國別抱着共同追求人類正義部護世界和平的合作者，歡欣鼓舞的來迎接廿四屆國察合作節，無疑的，是具有劃時代的歷史意義。　　遠在百年之前，一八三五年的時候，世界合作運動創始者羅拔歐文早就在偷敦组織了各國各界聯合會，企圖運用國際合作的力量，來消除人類的剝削和戰爭，實現其空想的合作理想，歐文這一世界機構，便是國際合作最原始的形態　　從歐文底各國各界聯合會演變到國際合作聯盟會，發展到現階段的全過程中，國際合作運動底發展，可以劃分爲四個　段來加於研究，使我們對於它底每一發展階段的基本內容和新任務，得到一個正確性的認識，而更有把握地去開拓它底光明之前途。　　自一八九五年國際合作聯盟會成立，到一九〇二年在孟　斯特舉行大會。這是國際合作運動的發　階段。在這一發展階段中，確定了國際合作的理想和方法，主要的內容，是促使合作運動從狹隘的國家主義和畛域觀念的範疇中解放出來，躍進一個沒有種族沒有國別的國際合作聯盟會。這一進步的　變，從合作共和世界大同的角度來看，由個別的走向集體的，從各個國家走向國際的聯合，無庸否認的，是達成了相當重要的任務。儘管羅虛戴爾在今天怎樣被歷史判定它是一條錯誤的路綫、但是在資本主義剛剛抬頭的時候，對於被產　革命的洪　所冲　而陷於飢寒交迫的廣大勞苦大衆，羅虛戴爾諸先驅的確是盡了相當有價値的啓蒙工作。在國際合作聯盟會底章程中，有着以次的規定：「本會爲承繼羅虛戴兩諸先驅的工作計劃，決以獨立的精神，自己的方法，將這一全　社會的利益基於自助互相原則底合作制度去代替現今私人企業底競爭制度。」這顯然是一局抽象的話，但也足以說明國際合作運動與現存私有制度所存在着矛盾及其所負的任務。正如國際合作聯盟會已故秘書長梅氏所說一樣；「聯合全世界民衆，增進個人底幸福；同時，創造世界底文明，這就是國際合作聯盟會底理想，它要造成一個世界的聯邦，消滅戰爭，避免衝突，創造一個永不見貧富的社會制度，並建立世界的和平。」國際合作運動在這一發展階段的偉大貢獻，是確定了國際合作運動總的路綫，目標和任務，但是還沒有指出合作連動對於政治的關聯與社會制度的依存性，沒有規劃實現國際合作聯盟會理想的具體奮鬥方法，把國際合作運動之崇高的理想去和現實配合起來。因之，這一發展階段底國際合作運動，就祗能做到一些合作敎育和國際合作運動的研完聯系等工作。　　從一九〇四年舉行大會之後，一直到第一次世界大戰爆發的前一年，可以說是國際合作運動底第二個發展階段。這時候，許多進步的合作者開始注意到合作運動與勞動大衆連鎖的意義，建立了新合作理論的基礎。瑞士代表穆勒氏主張提醒消費者底勞動大眾連鎖的觀念，並促使他們了解合作底目的，不僅在改善自己的生活，而在廢除一切利潤。這一新金作理論的闡揚，對於國際合作運動底發展，的確是起了相當有力的推動作用，構成了這一發展階段的主要特徵，從空想的走到實踐的科學的道路上。　　國際合作運動底第三個發展階段，可以說是從半睡眠的停頓狀態中復活。第一次世界大戰開始直到一九二〇年，由於戰爭的　係，有許多團體退出了聯盟會，以致經常的活動，無形停頓至七年之久，可以說是陷於半陲眠狀態中，在這期間聯盟會雖然通過和平決議案，呼籲和平；但基於聯盟會本身機構的軟弱，這種空想的決議與和平的呼籲，是給戰爭的砲火所融解了。直至一九二六年法國全國合作聯盟會的巴黎會議起，到九二七年，國際合作聯盟會才從半睡眠狀態中復活起來。在這一發展階段的後半期中，値得特別提出的，是在比利時廿脫城召開第十次大會中，中央委員會規定：「每年七月第一個星期六爲國際合作節，於一九二二年開始，届時全世界舉行慶祝·「這個規定，對於合作者的認識上和國際合作的發展，是起了相當重大的作用。國際合作組織，在這期間普遍發展，廣大合作者互相親密地携手起來，合作運動在這一發展階段的後半期中是以一種嶄新的姿熊出現，結成一條反資本主義的聯合陣綫，它的最大成功和最大的貢獻，不在於道一發展階段的國際合作運動把各國廣大的產業合作部門由個別的形式轉化到國際的形式，而是這一發展階段的合作運動由於經過第一次世界大戰的砲火和血肉的洗禮，從戰鬥中長成，在資本主義高度的發展下，把國際合作運動和廣大的農工勞動大衆建立了更密切的聯　·國際聯盟並根據凡爾　條約，設立國際勞丁局合作部，以謀各國勞工生活的改善。這）新的決定，把合作運動從舊的「純經濟」的窠臼中解放出來，朝着一個新的政治與經濟交流的方向推進，的確是一個進步的轉變。　　第四個發展階段，起自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌，直至聯合國成立爲止，這期間的開始，是國際資本主義發生了經濟總危機，演變到法西斯强盜德，日，意，結成了侵略陣營，瘋狂的發動侵略戰爭，同時中，美，英，蘇，爲了維　世界和平，則結成了反侵略的陣營，在和平被破壞之後，用戰爭來消滅戰爭，终局是民主主義克服了法西斯主義，並組成了聯合國目前正在努力求致全世界人類的永久和平與安全。合作運動在這期間的初期，也可以說，在它這一發展階段的前半期，是曾經協助各國政府當局挽救經濟危機；迨至法西斯强盜發動侵略戰爭之後，它在侵略陣綫中，無庸否認的，也曾經被法西斯强盜變質利用，作爲發展其武力經濟的淸道夫，但是在反侵略陣營中的合作運動，却曾經英勇地披上反侵略的戰袍，協助聯合國家，發動民衆參加對敵經濟作戰的工作。在中國，美國，英國利蘇聯，戰時的合作運動，全都廣泛的發展起來，担任了反侵略戰爭割時代的使命。美國的合作者，更進一步的，召開了國際合作會議，通過了若干有價値的國際合作運動決議案，並聯合我國創設國際合作學院，爲戰後國際合作運動培育高級的合作幹部人才，這正意味着國際合作運動在今天以後，必將更加發展，更加進步。今天，聯合國家已經獲取了光輝的勝利，正在努力從事世界永久和平基礎的重建工作，合作運動在這一發展階段中，應該怎樣的記取旣往經騐，怎樣的去把握這一有利的時機，以開闢它未來的光明前途呢？這是全世界愛好和平的合作者當前所必需急切解答的課題。作者願就個人淺見所及，提出了以次的幾個原則：　　一，國際合作聯盟會應該立即召開臨時大會，積極改組，討論世界合作運動當前諸問題，擬訂一個發展全世界合作運動的實施綱領，目前尤須設法要求聯合國允許參加國際善後救濟工作，以及推派代表參加聯合國社會經濟理事會。　　二，國際合作銀行委員會應即改組爲國際合作銀行，切實負起調劑各國合作金融的任務。　　三，國際批發合作委員會應即改組爲國際批發合作社，社址設於美國，必要時，並在各國設立辦事處，協助各國批發合作社或合作供銷處發展國際合作貿易。　　四，國際婦女合作基爾特應擴大工作範疇，切實協助各國推展婦女合作運動。　　五，國際合作學院應即恢復，加以擴充，廣泛的協助各國培養合作人才，並建立一個完整的正確的合作理論體系。　　從國際合作運動一個世紀的發展史上看來，我們知道，它已經從原始的空想社會主義逐漸轉變到科學的現實的道路上。値茲聯合國重建世界和平的現刻，國際形勢空前改觀，國際合作運動必須切實把握這一有利的時機，健全並充實自己本身的力量，英勇地担當起新世界經濟建設的歷史使命。作者所提出的幾個原則，是今後發展國際合作運動最低限度的要求，期望全世界合作者，從今天起，齊一步伐，共同努力肩起國際合作運動這一新階段的新任務，以促進世界人類朝着和平幸福的領域邁進。今日之菲律賓　　這幢設備完整的近代化醫院，探用美國近代醫藥原理。（本報特約紐約特時報攝寄）當前的經營政策　上海市公用事業　廻顧與前瞻　（續）  趙曾玨　　上海以前因爲有租界和治外法權的關係，各自爲政，不相統屬，本市公用事業的統盤計劃，當然無從談起，現在租界收回，治外法權亦已取消，所有外商公司，都已接受中國政府的監督和指揮，我們的政策可以自由推行了。照一般人意見，公用事業應由公家經營至少亦應由國人自辦，但就本人來滬主管公用事來九個朋的程騐觀察：　　第一·外商公司對於中國政府的合作精神甚好，因此國人以爲己往懷疑外人在上海投資設廠，即爲被壞主權的觀念，在政權統一的今日，應當改變。　　第二·上海現有各種建設的成績，頗多外商努力的成果，平心而論，有幾個公司效率很好，否們在不礙主權之原則下，自當繼續予以維持及保障。　　關於治本方法，我們欲使上海成爲一個世界現代化的都市，必須確立上海都市交通網。但在大上海整們建設計劃未完成以前，當然不能具體確定。大概說來，此計劃應使水陸空三者，密切配合。海港方面，就自然環境觀察，最好以吳淞爲深水港，日暉港爲淺水港。鐵路方面，最好即以吳淞和日暉港為貨運總站，而以梵皇渡西站爲客運總站·空運方面，將來最好把龍華和虹橋路二處機劃爲民用航空站。市內的陸上交通，應使中山南路與中山東二路連接，以與中山西路及北路構成環形，作爲環市快車道，行駛高速度電車，至於東西幹道，除中正路外，徐家匯路將肇家浜塡沒後，亦可貫通市區（南京路太狹不宜行駛電車）。南北幹路，一爲西藏路，二爲中正南路及北路。這幾條幹綫，應以行駛公共汽車為主，電車應移至郊區及鄉村。　　市區與郊區，應有公共汽車以爲聯繫，設立中心公共汽車車站。各長途汽車的終點站，亦可附設於此。　　根據以往統計，如以現在全市人口三百五十萬計算每日電車及公共汽車的乘客，應有一百五十八萬人，假如每一車輛平均每日載客一千五百人，那就應有電車或公共汽車一千〇六十輛。再預計五年後人口的增加，以至低限度推算，的爲四十萬人，則須增加車輛一百七十輛。又設以機動車代替其他各式非機動軍，又須增加四百輛。故至第五年之末，全市公共車輛應有一六三〇輛，方可應付。而現在祇有四四七輛，應逐年遞增使之適應需要。　　浦東方面岸綫出口太少，應該重行規劃。東昌路，可作爲浦東交通的出發點，那裏前面有現成的浦東大道，與上川上南鐵路速接。軍人余兆祺押粤　麥道高請假離港  特約記者林有蘭　　　本報一日香港航訊　　余兆　自六月廿四日　　後（　一）　港　　　中「紳士」名流最近特設起於七月一日公宴麥週之看管，一日已交我方押返廣州。港府卅日發氏，並邀各界參加。是項消息，首次見於廿八日表聲明，謂余氏之軍人身份，　已證實，故交回我方查辦·先是，本港英陸軍總司令菲士廷將軍，廿八日特飛省與我方會商，廿九日返港。余案吿解決，本港「反華」最有力人物輔政司麥道高，忽以因病請假返英聞。麥氏之去，似屬倫敦當局有意緩和我方對麥措施（包括國民日報停刊事件）之反感，並乘機從新檢討今後港府政策。麥去後，港府對我駐港軍政機關之能度，預料不致陸續惡化，但亦不見得就會從此好轉。聞港府頑固分子，遭此番挫折，頗憤憤不平。麥氏假滿（三月爲期）後返港與否，可覘英國對港府反華政策之態度。　麥此次突然宣佈返英，耐人尋味：麥隨英軍重返港後，初任軍政府民政長官·港府恢復民政，麥改署理輔政司「麥道高先生請休養假三個月，下週返英。不少Colonial　Secretary職務，六月初始奉命眞除·皇家人物將不免黯然魂銷！」港報，不料事隔僅一日，即有麥因病返英之消息。該慶功宴忽變爲長亭祖　，紳士「黯然魂消」　　（註二）　想亦非麥意料所及。　　因此，麥此行當係「奉召」而無疑。據消息　通方面稱，麥之失意與英大使薛穆對港府政策之指摘，大有關係。　　又據最後探悉：麥現年四十二歲，蘇格蘭人，一九二八年年底首次來港，當初級公務人員。在港府服務已有十七年之久。能說華語，有「中國通」之稱。　　（註一）聞余曾取得美國某名廠出品DDT及澳洲某名酒廠的中國總經售權，利用軍人地位營商，獲利極豐。　　（註二）見卅日新生晚報載:水上交通　　市輸渡自去年接收以後，先後恢復滬淞長途綫及東東其秦對江渡二綫載客人數去年十月份爲二十八萬八千餘人，至本年四月已增至一百十四萬七千餘人，增加率達三倍以上，加以民營濟渡的積極整理，浦江水面交通，比諸接收初期，當然已有不少進步。但按諸實際需要，相差仍遠。　　我們爲繁榮浦東起見，治標方面除督導重要民營濟渡改用輪拖增加載重量外，治本之計，自應興建浦江大橋及隧道，但此項計劃需費過於龐大，一時恐難實現，所以擴展輪渡業務，實爲急要之岡，現在上海市輪渡預備在本年度內用小輪三艘增闢對江渡二綫，即塘董綫慶定綫其中有一輪可載汽車二輛渡江。明年度起再增闢南航綫，以與上南鐵路相連繫，另闢對江渡一二綫同時籌購二百噸裝載汽車大輪二艘，每輪可載二十一尺長之卡車十輛或普通客車二十輛及渡客四百五十人渡江，此項渡車航綫，經一再研究，僉認以東東綫最爲適宜。電話方面　　（一）治標方面：　　（1）加速接綫：因用戶不熟悉使用電話方法，以致佔線過久機件不及應付，現由該公司「除　登報公吿並於賬單中通吿用戶外，幷在局內加緊淸除佔線過久情形，接線現已加速。　　五月份於五秒鐘內聽得撥號音比率，已由75％增高至83％，接通之百分此亦由66％改進至70％　　（2）加速修理裝置：過去因工匠人數不够，現正大批訓練，的七八十人，於兩月後可加入服務，修理裝置，可望加速。自改用新收費辦法後，用戶使用電話次數已較前减少。大致住宅區用戶减低較多，的較四月份少20％，商業區較四月份减少不足10％，以後當再飭該公司加緊宣傳，使用戶節省電話。　　（二）治本方面：　　上海市電話技術委員會成立迄今，已開會十六次，改進計劃已大體擬就，現正草撰報吿，預備向有關方面提出。該計劃內容，分爲兩部：（一）依市區重要區域內電話之可能發展，擬定五年計劃，預計至民國三十九年該區電話可能發展至十五萬線·（二）以全上海市區電話之可能發展，擬具廿五年計劃，預計至民國五十九年底上海可能有電話五十七萬線，話機八十萬具。　　該項計劃之如何實施，關係中央政策，本局當秉承中央政策辦理之。　（未完）社會服務　答復讀者　　醫藥衛生　　　（一）墨浩問　鄙人素仰貴報爲大衆服務，忠實誠懇，不勝感佩。五年前無形中成爲鼻涕朝夕不絕流出，其色淸黃濃厚，有時發出一種莫名之味，早晨更多。實覺難受，每每挖破鼻子，鮮血流出，不忍一睹。在三月前發覺鼻中當央隔骨已經爛成一個洞，所以急急向紅十字醫院鼻科求治，那知數次以後，摸不着頭緒，尤是騐血騐鼻中爛肉，亦沒有綫索，現在只搽些藥膏，潤潤爛肉，滴些藥水，毫不見效，敬問（一）這究竟何病，鼻中隔骨之洞，是否能補好？（二）對於腦子身體是否有述接關係，頭痛是否爲此毛病？（三）如何方法能治愈？並請介紹一位對於鼻科有豐富經騐的醫師。　　〔張仲明醫師答〕（一）係萎縮性鼻炎，中隔骨之洞，如已成立極難補好。（二）鼻與腦及身體，當然有連接關係，頭痛原因，即在於此。（三）宜光用X光診察及血液檢騐，然後再定奪治寮方法。　　（二）施淵明問　敝友王君之子現年十五歲，患羊癇瘋業已三年，當在夜間發作，甚至每夜連發數次，醫治無效，懇乞賜示特效良藥，刋載貴欄，俾能依方服藥，早見痊愈，匪特身受者感恩不盡，鄙人亦感銘無旣矣。　　〔張仲明醫師答〕羊癇瘋只可用安眠劑等以治標，無特別治本之法，最好能請神經科專家診斷，腦中是否有瘤或膿痬，如有，際此科學昌明時代，可以割治。徵求人才　　（一）某企業公司徵聘化學技師一位，須大學化學系畢業，精通化學原理或具藥師格資者爲合格，月薪二十萬。（二）駐日某部隊徵求縫工，中西廚司，理髮匠各數人，月薪自拾至二十萬元，凡有上列各項經騐願意赴日本工作者，可於七月二日以前來所應徵。（三）市郊某醫院徵求女性助產士二人，月薪四萬五千元，供膳宿。（四）本市重慶南路某公館須聘請家庭敎師一人，每日授課五小時月薪四萬至五萬元，如應徵人住處遙遠，可供中午便餐，以師範畢業或大學肄業者為合格。（五）某實業社徵求推銷員十人，推銷漿糊打印油及文具等項，月薪二萬併以佣金百分之十訂酬。（六）駐日某軍事機關徵求藥劑師或藥劑生三人，月薪的爲美金二百五十元左右，須正式藥科畢業及有調劑經騐者為合格，應徵者須帶證件送騐。有願上項職務者請至北四川路八五六號社會部上海職業介紹所介紹組面洽。蘇北難民捐款　　　德民義務小學全體學生　六萬一千一百五十元，德果堂五萬元，周鄭彩娟一萬元，了緣三千元，以上共收十二萬四千一百五十元。</p>

<p>每週書刊　　每星期六出版七七紀念　　明日，全國將熱烈地來紀念七七；蘆溝橋的石獅子，倘若有靈的話，也得揚眉吐氣的怒吼一下子。　　蘆溝橋的石獅子，眼看廣中日戰爭的烽火，由它身邊蔓延到全國，使不知多少的窮鄉僻村，繁榮城市，以及成千成萬的男女老幼，在烈焰中煎熬了八個年頭。　　蘆溝橋石獅子身旁星般的火焰，竟越過了重洋，帶到全球各地。　　在勝利後的今日，盧溝橋的石獅子，雖知道國內外和平尚未奠定，建設尚未開始，然而在敵人鐵蹄下過了八個年頭，它知道「七七」的烽火是民族世界再生的烽火；它的怒吼，亦將在勝利後的「七七」紀念，來換醒全國人民不能聽任內亂再起！九年之前的七月七日，日本在盧溝橋揭開了侵略戰爭的序幕。國民政府決定長期抗戰國策後，遷都重慶。國示日機狂炸陪都，烈燄衝滅，但卻更堅定我們同仇敵愾的決心。全國各地壯丁踴躍投軍，經過編訓後，紛開龍線，捍衛祖國。一面抵抗，一面建立機械化部隊；知識青年亦秉「國家興忘匹夫有責」之義，予敵迎頭痛擊。全國民眾，「有錢出錢，有力出力」，共同抵禦敵寇。前線民眾，協助軍隊，挖掘戰壕。]　我軍乘巨型運輸機，開赴各收復區，從事接收工作。蔣主席於勝利之後，在陪都招待毛澤東，舉杯祝賀。春秋梁山泊（小說）  池沼　　一星期前就記掛著：五月廿二是妻的生日，是她剛逢卅歲的一個壽辰，為了她底勤勞；為了她底遭遇；我該為她慶祝一下，使她也開顏笑一次。　　我鄉的俗語：「五月生仔（子）好做官；五月生女敗家門。」真的，妻像是註定了不好命運，和我結婚了十年，第二年就遭遇到戰爭，在事敵不能，投偽不甘，內還無力，投械無本的環境裡，我們一直過著受磨難的黑暗日子，還要受了養活四個孩的累。勝利了，該是光明了吧，然而環顧四周，仍是陰沉的天氣，更使人鬱悶得透不過氣來！　　妻是和順的，總抱著「嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗」的舊觀念。雖然有時也會感慨「百無一用是書生」。但結果還是「不怨天，不尤人」，我就沒有像她那種好脾氣。　　為了妻的生辰，一天晚上，我特地跑到她哥哥那裡去，想他們也來參加我們的「盛典」。　　按了電鈴，僕人引進地板過蠟的客廳裡，幾乎使我滑了一交，主人夫婦都在樓上，我寂寞地在等著，聽到時鐘的搭的鐘聲，我呆看鐘的長針一分分在移動，約過了半個鐘頭，才聽到樓梯響了。　　「呵，呵，今天天氣好，——累你等了，因為有些小事未完，才遲下來，呵呵，」主人露出呵欠的樣子。　　我開始和主人寒暄著，談不到四句話，他又提到他的本行來了。　　「今天，今天市場上股票大跌，景福最高到過五百四十多元，現在退回二百元左右了……」他像津津有味，打了一個呵欠又繼續說：「本來證交要複業了，××做董事長，一般人都「看好」的，反會「小」起來，這就叫做「人心難測」……說到這裡他便縱笑起來。「幸好，我前些時因欠缺「頭寸」，「出龍「了大部分，今天趁低價吸收，都塌到便宜貨了，與是」蝕嫌「也有個定數，像人不是靠運氣好，早就「坍了」，得意忘形的，他像表演的說給我聽。　　他的話，我只有應的份兒，也沒有同情他的興奮。我和他每次的見面，他總是叨嘮著誇張著我不懂的事情。我恐怕他再說下去，使我受不了。我只有提出主題對他說：　　「二哥，廿二是四妹的生日，我想請你和嫂嫂們去吃頓便飯。」　　「哦！哦！你不提起我都忘了，四妹今年卅歲了，那苦命的……」他看了我一眼，忙把最後要說的話縮回去，我卻報以沉默。　　「該，應該，俗語說：一人先生見月當頭」，「他轉變口氣地，「可是現在請客也難，前天我在新都請朋友吃便飯，十五萬一桌也沒有什麼，你替她在那裡做壽酒？」他又露出懷疑的神氣說：　　他的問話，真是出乎意料之外，使我不覺發怔起來。我只好靦靦地說：　　「就，就是在舍間，我的意思是趁四妹的生日大家團聚一下，晚上七點鐘要請你們賞光。」說到最後，我微弱的聲音，幾乎使他聽不清楚。　　「呵！呵！」他像要笑出來「好極，四妹在家裡時燒小菜都是經驗豐富的，我們准來。」　　在窒息的空氣裡，到這時我才感到一點溫暖，再和主人敷衍幾句就告辭出來，承他客氣，送我到客廳上，讓我穿過小天井摸著不熟識的門鎖打開走以外面。　　舊歷十幾的月亮浴著我底全身，我才感覺到這才是自己的天地。我深深吸了一口晚涼趕來的空氣，儘管街邊坐著許多乘涼的人，我心裡卻忖著自己的事。　　妻，從小餐沒了父母，就她親哥哥差使著養大，也許她哥為了不想「貼嫁妝，嫁妹子」，才給了我這不當不對的。我們雖是親戚，說到往來，卻只有我們到他們家裡去。十年裡頭他們的影兒也沒有幾次會光臨到我們家裡來，妻每向同居們說起她那富有的哥哥，新同居也是疑信參半。妻也曾為了丈夫窮就運自己向人說有個富有的哥哥，但人家並不是聽信而引起　　。　　我這次特地跑去請她的哥嫂我家，也是為了想討她歡喜，因為當「貴客臨門」而妻對「貴客」叫「二哥二嫂」時，複引起同居們的羡慕和驚訝吧。　　現在她哥哥答應來了，我想這消息妻聽了一定高興的，我底心悄也愉快起來。想到這裡加緊腳步，我要趕快回去告訴她聽這個「喜訊」，這因為事前她卻沒有知識我出去的原因，而我的不預先向她說，而為了恐怕她哥哥不答應時而增加她的傷感。　　「好消息，你猜猜是什麼？」到了家，遇到麥，我劈頭就問她說。　　「現在沒有獎券，當然不是中頭獎，那必定是晚報上說國共停戰吧！」妻還像憧驚著在淪陷時期，我們窮極了，只希望中頭獎來解救，不經意地說，　　「不是！」妻在思索，「定是國防最高委員會通過了立法院對公務員改善待遇的提案，你是公教人員，所以說是好消息。」妻說到這裡也像是很興奮的。　　「那更不是，那好消息就是你哥哥在你生日那天到我們家裡來！」我忍不住連珠地說出了。　　「真的！哥哥要來！」　　「誰騙你，我剛剛從他家裡來。」　　這時，我才告訴妻，我準備替她做三十大慶，為了經濟關係，只請她哥嫂到來，連我們家裡六個人，剛好是一桌。　　「可是，豈不又要花費錢？妻口裡雖是這種說，而心裡卻極高興的，她面上的顏色掩不住她的喜悅，我知道她心裡一定在想：哥嫂能到來，自己面上有了光彩，同居們再不會不信了，就是多花些錢也是值得的。　　到了妻生日那天，為了不使她過分忙碌，我在下午向學校告了半天假，在家指揮著孩子整理一切，妻在廚房預備齊小菜，怪興奮的。　　我和孩子們把他們的睡床和物雜物暫時寄到曬臺上，大兒馨拖地板，二兒曼抹桌椅，三兒桂倒痰盂，最小的蘭兒，從廚房跑上亭子間，又跑下去，為往的穿插著，他還告訴小同伴們：「舅舅今天到我家吃雞雞，吃肉，吃魚，吃外國標子……」　　忙到下午四點多鐘，我們自己也感覺到自己的亭子間光彩起來，就是招待貴客看得過眼了。向鄰家借來的一張大圓桌，放在本來安置孩子們睡床的地方，碗??匙?都攏上了，我又告訴孩子，誰坐那裡，誰坐這裡，並叮囑他們吃飯要規矩。妻也把一切小菜都配備好，應炒的都待貴客到達時才「起火」。　　時鐘響了七下，夏令時間的太陽還是很熱烈的，可是我們的心卻漸漸冷下來。　　「怎麼還不來，你別騙我，或是聽錯了吧」妻感到焦急地說　　「客人要比約定的時間遲來，才顯得有身架，你別急，誰騙你的。」我只有安慰著妻。　　我們秉歸沉寂了，只默默地等候，誰也不說一句話。　　「姑奶奶，姑奶奶，」敲著後門的聲音。　　「來啦！」妻在應著「他們和娘姨一同來了，」她又興奮地說，接著便搶下去開門。　　我會心地露出笑，孩子們也笑了。　　「舅母，舅舅，」關兒也搶著下去，邊叫邊走。　　「少爺和少奶奶，今晚有事情，叫我來通知，叫姑奶奶和姑爺「多吃杯」「我聽到娘姨粗糙的響聲，心不覺跳動起來。　　表慢慢地踱回上來，眼是潤濕的，顫動的手，拿著一個紅封，關兒跟上來了。　　「這，這是哥哥送的壽儀，他們不來，還給他們吧，「妻像哽咽著說，她在徵求我的意見，一面解開封包，是一千元的新鈔，整十張。　　「唔！「我不置可否地說。　　「可是，」妻停頓了一下眼注視著鈔票」為了說他們來，小菜也買了，所以我那裡存的錢也不多了。　　「那末，就受了他的禮吧！打賞娘姨二千元也夠了，退回去，豈不是生意見，不好看了。　　「我也領會到妻的意思，順水推盤地說。　　妻又走下去了，關兒也跟著，他又去告訴小同伴說，舅舅不來吃雞雞了。　　「謝謝姑奶奶，「我只聽到娘姨的粗野的笑聲。　　吃飯時，我對孩子們說：「我們舉行家宴，慶祝媽媽生辰，」我又叫孩子們向媽媽道喜。　　「媽媽，恭喜！」小聲音像交響樂地碰出來。　　妻像感謝我的好意露出笑容，但我觀察出，那是不自然的笑，她心上還像想著那令人遺憾的事。　　「媽媽，舅舅，為什麼不來！」關兒說。　　「前年舅母卅歲生日，我和爸爸媽都去的，」愛兒插著嘴。　　「我還在客廳裡滑跌了幾交，」桂兒在回憶著。　　「我們窮，舅舅不到窮人家裡的，」大兒馨像是懂得了那真實的答案。　　這使妻更觸動起來，眼圈也紅了。　　「孩子，你們愛媽媽不？」我連忙說。想借此說開了。　　「愛，愛，愛，愛」小弛同聲地。　　「那末，你們長大了要孝順媽媽，你們先說你們將來要做個什麼樣人，你們說了，爸爸也講個故事給你們聽。」　　「爸爸，爸爸，我要做個「馬桶佬（倒馬桶的）」關兒搶著先說，接著他就做出推馬桶車的手勢，又「倒馬桶」「倒馬桶」地叫出來。　　「我做「開車佬」，「桂兒又說，他把筷敲起碗來，表示叮口當口當的電車聲.　　「我做賣票，爸爸媽媽坐車不要錢，」愛兒像受了桂兒的感染而說出來.　　大兒馨，只笑著。「你呢？」我指著他，他像怕難為情的，經我催促幾次，他才說：　　「我要做個革命的，使世界沒有貧富的大分別。」　　「你們做什麼都好，卻不要介爸爸做教師的，」妻感歎地說。「真的，倒馬桶的人怎　就不少，一個馬桶每月收費二千元，你想那數目該是怎樣大。」　　「好了，好了，我們吃酒吃飯吧！」我怕又勾引起妻那種傷感，只好借這件事解關，蘭兒也讓他吃了一杯，不久他就嚷著！肚皮裡有火燒起來，引得妻真的開顏大笑了，我和妻也痛快地多吃兩杯。　　飯後我們吃著標子，孩子們更要履行對他們的諾言。為了那天是妻的生辰，我觸機地講了水滸傳上“智取生辰綱「那段故事給他們聽，使得三個小的都要改行了。　　「爸爸，我不做「馬桶佬」啦，我要做「赤發鬼劉唐。」蘭兒首先提議說。　　二兒是要做「托塔天王晁蓋」；三兒卻要做「入雲龍公孫勝」。大兒雖不響，問他卻要做「智多星吳用」。　　「好，好，我們都上梁山伯去，」我趁著酒興來答覆他們。　　「你們快睡去吧，爸爸喝酒又要發牢騷了，他上梁山泊還不是做那書生無（吳）用。」妻在調侃著我說。　　「爸爸太不滿現實，咀咒現實了，」大兒平日雖受了我的薰陶，但我卻驚訝他會說出那兩句話，於是使我更興奮起來，我更把「白日鼠白勝」唱的歌兒教給孩子們，我覺得那首歌正表現著現社會的一切情形，是寄著遼遠的深意。　　「赤日炎炎似火燒，　　野田禾稻半枯焦，　　農夫心內如湯煮，　　公子王孫把扇搖。」　　當孩子爭誦著的時候，我卻憧憬著上梁山泊的美夢，朦朧地睡去了。　　卅五，七，三。長篇連載雙宿雙飛　七六  趙清閣　　「小華！小華！你看叔叔當年不是沒有紅過呀！紅得達官巨富都來捧場；紅得太太小姐們都來吊膀子；紅得門前常是車水馬龍；紅得沒有開羅，戲園子裡已經擠的人山人海；可是，「石玉樓頓了頓，他痙攣地揮了揮手。」卅年後，人老了，偶然因為病，嗓子差了勁兒，他們就不能原諒，就硬把我打入冷宮！他們，還是那些「達官巨富」；還是那些「太太小姐」；又捧上了新角；又愛上了年青的！小華，人就是這樣的沒有人心嗎？你說叫我怎能不瘋？不瘋？他的眼淚在眶裡閃著兒。　　「石叔叔，您可別怪我呀，我並不要他們捧，更不要奪了您的「頭牌」，讓您沒飯吃！」麗燕抽噎地解釋著。她感到自己被評為了一個罪人的委屈。　　「噢，不！我不是指的你說，小華，我知道你並不要他們「捧」；更不要奪我的「頭牌」；可是，他們願意捧你；你的媽以及你的師父，也希望他們捧你；因為你的媽，你的師父希望你紅！我不能叫座了，戲園子的老關，便會把頭牌讓給叫座的人。這在他們是「天經地義」而全不是你的責任！我也絕不怪你！不過，我得告訴你：小華，你將來的處境比我更難，前途比我更可怕呀！你是一個女孩子，女孩子「紅「起來容易，可「倒」下去也容易!女孩子唱戲除了藝術之外，就是色相。看客對於女令們，倒是「色相」重於「藝術」。藝術差點，只要色相好，就能叫座。色相不好，藝術再高明，就不能紅，而且捧女伶們的看客，都還另有用心，這個，是現

<p>自由談盲？  少夫　　方型刊物一網打盡，走在街頭，報攤上不再像從前那様的花花綠綠，目迷五色，使人眼睛清爽多了。　　單是這樣，並不够目的。　　談到戰後的文化建设，確寶可僯，幾家大書店，十個月來，出過幾木像樣的書？連紀述這次史無前例的戰史，到而今還無影從，無怪有人在大聲疾呼——最是令人害怕颤憟了：廿行省，八年又二個月，横裏縱裏，是這次戰，這次抗戰，這次順古未有的抗戰。我們的戰史呢？我們的戰史呢？　　也並不是著作界不掙氣，出版界不努力，請問：排工每千字八千元，報紙三萬幾一令，有錢的人寗肯寶黃金購美鈔，誰也不願投资到这倒霉的出版事業上來；而讀者，整天在生活圈子襄打滚，哪裏還有心情讀書，即使有黠餘暇，看黠小報，什麼言慧珠自殺，××春光外拽……等短而刺激的耳食之谈。　　这是整個出版界危险的一面。　　另一面，也同樣的可怕：一本用道林紙影印版精印的美國『生活』雜誌，或『時代』雜誌，祇寶五六百塊錢，而『新聞天地』『見聞』寶五六百元卻還大虧其本，至於紙張印刷內容，又何常能以擬呢？旅行雜誌寶一千元，祇是勉強够印刷成本而已。所好者，『生活』『時代』並未出中文版，否則，那真不堪想像。出版界的朋友，看到『時代』『生活』社的上海辨事處的大卡車在馬路上飛馳，心襄怎禁得住不既羡慕又慚愧！　　願大家仔佃地思索一番：我們是否要做一個無知無識的交育國民？我們的子孫是否讓他們沒有精神食糧？讀『自卑』後  酉廷　　本刊前幾天登了一篇『自卑』，讀後使我連想到下面这許多話：　　怕羞，胆小，懦弱，自己不信任自己，造成了自卑。自卑的结果是：表面的拘謹，過分的謙恭，內心的空虛和性格的虚伪。這種Coward舆Weak的個性，使整個人生顯得異常可憫！　　社會上有各式各樣的人，有盛氣凌人的，有目中無人的，有理『缺』氣壯的，但也有處處妄自菲薄，畏首胃尾的自卑者。這一種人覺得自己處處不如人家，是一個失敗主義者。『自卑』，其寶是一種神經衰弱。當他投考一學校前，常會想：『恐怕我考不進吧』，——即使他預備得很充分。當他走進一個公司工作時，看見上司，往往會偈促不安，不知所措。當他要向當局提出一個請求時，自卑的恐懼，又使他始終欲開口而不敢開口。這種個常常有三大難題：謀事，借錢，求愛。遇到這些需要時，他就陷於梗大的矛盾中——心裏明明想這樣請求，口裏又終始說不出來，即使勉強說出來了，也是騰里騰尬，非常為難的。　　這種人永遠是可憐的：說不出自己的意見。當他走進一個會場時，如果人家已經開始會談，他只好偷偷摸摸地，躲在會場的角落里，打死他也不敢走到前面去，更遑諭要他發言了。這種人常常處於檢其『符』的局面襄。　　自卑是一種極其嚴重的『心理病』。　　心理教育家分析這個毛病的原因說，這舆小時候的家庭教育有關。童養媳最易養成自卑舆孤獨的心理。原因是：從小，他就沒有自山發展個性的機會，一直在在高壓下過活。　　其實，舊式家庭的家庭教育，未來就要把小孩子教育得呆板，拘谨，循規蹈規，學習機械的禮貌，結果都成了道地的童養媳。所謂管教嚴厲的家庭，無非當用打罵的教育，小孩子偶有觸犯大人，便即打罵交加，而且還不許哭。家長往往希望子女成為一個奴隸式的順子孝孫。其實這種子弟在表面上是馴服了。但內心襄往往仍會感到他沒有得到父愛和母爱的。　　這樣子，對家庭，既引起了家庭情愛的內在裂痕，對子女，徒使他成為一個胆怯的弱者。　　目中無人是不對的，但目中沒有自己，也不應該；生存於原子時代的今日，一方面應當不讓自己低能，一方面不應當自卑，也唯其不自卑，才能使自己不低能。做小孩子的，不要為了一塊糖向大人卑躬屈膝，做大人的，應當相信自己的能力，充實自己的能力，而不必處處覺得人家比我優越，由是乎戰戰兢兢，侷促不安，不管在任何場合，都非常失態。　　諴懇，有禮貌，和靄可觀是需要的，但必須得體，大方，不要把自己變成一個可憐的綿羊！　　——這平凡的意見，也許可以貢獻給『自卑』（指那篇文章）的作者葛尙德先生。扇子  蔭槐　　夏天，是扇子的季節。　　每一個人，男的或是女的，都手執蕭一柄扇子。目的當然不懂搖拂去炎暑的悶熟，文士們也還用來襯托高雅悠聞的風度。　　　　扇的種頬，繁複得可以。大別之可分為二類：（一）紈扇，俗名幽扇，團扇，團扇如月形，月經細的絲絹製成的，今日已不多见，有之也懂幾個收藏家或少敷爱美的女士们有罷了。但，據某名晝家說宋代以前的仕女却大多用此種紈扇的。（二）摺扇，這是今日應用最廣的扇子，但，出乎你意料之外，竟不是我國的國粹。　　摺扇亦稱摺叠扇，古名『聚頭扇』，大概因为一頭展開，一頭簇聚一處之故。相像出於高麗，雲釐漫鈔引鷄林志云：『高麗叠紙為扇，鍋獸壓環，加以銀飾，亦有晝人物者』。秋園雜佩也說：『元時高麗以此充貢，明永樂間始盛行於中國』。到了中國，製作竟『輔加華侈』，以蒸竹馬骨，夾以綾羅，貴家更有以象牙為骨，飾以金銀的。到了明末（一個窮奢極侈的時代）扇面竟以赤金紙製成。寶在是搘扇景華貴的時代。宜德弘治之際，李昭，馬動製作最精，得以名聞後世。　　茄馬殺現新航路後，摺扇隨著東方的珍寶，一寶被葡萄牙人帶到了歐洲。十八世紀時，會流行於注國路易十五的宮庭中，也煊耀於意大利舆西班牙，甚至埃及和印度。　　這是說的摺扇，若要論到扇子的鼻祖，还得推中國，我们在戯中见到的古代帝皇身後的儀仗中，有二扇掌形極大的障礙蔽日之昊，名字叫『障扇』的便是。宋史儀衝志載：『古者，扇嬰皆編次焳羽或尾为之，唐開元改為孔雀』。　　到今天，障扇隨著封建帝皇消逝，指扇因它的輕便，繁衍出多多少少動頭，風行在世間。壉某扇商說：就扇骨來分別，有象牙，玳辑，檀香木，紫檀木，湘妃竹，桃絲竹，水磨竹，和波羅，珊瑚，虎皮各種漆骨的等等。依扇面来分，也有雨金（大塊的），冶金（细黠的），和高麗的髪笺，安徽涇縣的白棉料纸等等。简直是屈指難敷。　　本市扇店大概有四十餘家，自備作場的卻就只王星記舆舒蓮，記二家。他們銷售國內外各處，一季的營業總額竟可逹四五萬萬元之請，真是駭人聽聞的一個敷字。　　報紙扇商談：其中最受人歡迎的當推水磨竹骨，白棉紙面的一種，這是所謂蘇扇。杭扇用於潛的桑皮紙，塗上諸暨的柿漆，能蓡水不透，但總嫌面目醜陋，不討人歡喜。　　自紙摺扇的價格舆油紙扇一般，是很便宜的，約自六七百至三四千不等，可是一經途上了名家的法書法繪，那可便身價百倍了，最高的潤格竟有五十萬一頁的山水，普通的畫扇面也在三萬元以上。　　但是轉限夏天過去，扇子也有了悲哀，除了瘋子以外，再無一個握著扇子的了，所以會為漢武帝一度熟變，卒被趙飛燕奪去了密愛的班倢伃，唱出了凄哀怨歌行：『……常恐秋節至，涼飚奪炎熱，東捐幾笱中，恩情中道絕。』為後世添了棄如秋扇之名詞。車廂裏面  中龜　　這個年頭見，小市民苦得透不過氣來，衣食住不用說，就是行也覺閑難，近處尙可安步當車，還處惟有借重電車和公共汽車，不巧的是電車和公共汽車內偏多許多要不得乘客：　　一·車廂內已很擠，空氣混濁非凡睹。　　二·座上徽有隙縫，不打量打量自己是大胖子，偏要佔座，旁邊的人忍不住反而只得站起來，他卻適得其好，復哉游哉。　　三·上車之前不預備好車錢，擠進車廂才往皮包內亂掏，手臂膊打落了人家太陽眼鏡，還像煞嘸事體。結果摸出來一張一百元現金，要寶票找。　　四·不是從那裏學來了搶坐的雅癖，人家讓給老公公坐的，他竟老寶不客氣捷『股』先登。　　五·雖要乘到底，一上車就堵在門口，方『便』之門，給他『閉』了。大殺風景  溪居　　六代金粉無遺跡　　案淮水榭為六朝勝蹟，洪楊亂後，滿目瘡痍，其時會文正公目擎荒烟蔓草，不覺觸景感懹，念秦淮向為歌舞之場，認為青溪晝舫雖屬怡情攬騰勝，要亦不可終廄，於是下令辦理一切善後，百廢俱舉，並發給長龍砲船敷十艘，令船戶領去，改作燈航，盡去兩岸瓦礫，命人沿河濫栽桃柳，畫楝朝飛，珠簾夕掛，俾士民遊宴，以為河房增色。數年以后，房屋漸復，淮清橋東西兩钓魚巷，皆为楚館秦樓，昔日風韻，年盛一年，及至公建篩抵任後，首詢秦淮風景，日敷偕寅僚慕客，泛舟於紅橋板頭，晝竟日宴會之樂，並令詠游仕女，不必引避，舆民同樂，歌頌异平盛極一時。　　迨至光緒二年，有人禀請督憲，出示驅逐妓館，並求立碑永禁，地方府憲為維時風化計·奉札出示驅禁，並限於三月內搬從，上自上新河，下至下關一帶境內，不準逗遛租屋私住，並謂：『倘若陽奉險謹，一經查出，除租戶從重懲辦外，屋主狥庇，一同懲究，將屋充公。』　　此令一出，各妓館唯有搬讓一空，當時七十年前申報對於此事，抨擊官府甚烈。除刊載此項新聞外，其上復以『大殺風景』為題，謂秦淮勝蹟月經會文正公游理善後後，『房屋漸次造起，日形熟閙。……不但小本經紀賴以燈船糊口，即如淮清橋大街一帶房屋，起造之多，鋪戶生意之盛，竟有漸漸復元，故至今廉不念交正公之德惠無窮者。至詰處之有妓館，則不自今日始。溯自六朝以後，至有明一代，向稱極盛以來，有增無減。先後諸名臣，開府其地，亦從未聞有查禁之舆。蓋以督部之尊，下行地方紃務，既侵官常，而且失體制。……從此秦淮風景，又變作蕭條氣象矣，昔人詩曰：『但使桑麻能遍野，誰甘行露夜深來？』最為忠厚。但不知驅之境外使其爲娼乎，使其從良乎，抑二十里外，便非制軍帷幄所及乎？吾不知假道學是誠何心而如壯殺風景耶！』　　次日申報主持第政者，又以『論禁娼妓一為題，重申前意，其交更為露骨尖刻，寶可以代表七十前對於禁娼間題之一般竟見，文曰：『甚矣哉，為政之難也！明知地方之事，有于功令，為害民生，茍無良法禁上，祇得置為後圖。……若妓館一事，中國由周有之，至今，二千除餘年，已無地無之，無時無之矣，前之人亦有禁之者，或陽奉陰達，即竟禁之，或始動而終怠，雖禁猶不禁，不如不禁之為愈。故制軍在籍時，亦從不讓及此也。……夫天下事，立一法必求其法之能行，斷不可漫焉為之作掩耳盜鈴之想。欲禁一業，必須響及位置此業方能望久行也。……』　　今者秦淮古蹟，已成汙積濁流，慕名而往，敗舆而回，誠令人不勝滄桑之感。現時國步維艱，遍地兵荒，民生塗炭，欲圖建國，必須首尚節約，而推行節約，端賴淳樓民風。我國值茲戰後，民力凋敝，然各大都市窮奢極侈，人慾橫流，『朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨』現象，遍處皆是，舞怪政府提倡禁舞動行節約，此正所謂此一時也彼一時也，不能不酌情以斷，以求國之先立，而後再談風景區之整節矣。玻璃汽車  知微　　目前最流行的日用品，要算是玻璃的製成品，玻璃雨衣，玻璃皮鞋，玻璃絲襪，玻璃皮夾……等等真是五花八門，樣樣都有，況且這些東西，穿戴美觀，價錢又便宜，無怪乎市上鋪天蓋地，開目皆是了。　　美國最近將玻璃汽車設計成功，設計者為威廉皮爾，斯太乎脫氏，此頰汽車完全將拍拉斯的克（Piastic）製成，並無車架，引擎裝在後部，重疊較普通汽車為輕，但較普通汽車為堅固。車架則以板代替，裝置於輪軸之上，地軸二端裝有二小汽胎，以防車身之颤動。車身之顏色，則早已染於拍拉斯的克內，以避噴漆之麻煩；車頭內可安置行李及備胎，車子後身則裝置　Mercury　V-8（八汽缸）之發動機，車門上之拉手則以電鈃代替；一撳則開，駕駛員旁之坐位，可自由移動，可舆後座之人對面談話。玻窗闊大，以便利觀看外面風景；後座甚闊，墊子可自動向前帶動靠背向後放平，成為一雙人臥牀。墊子計七十四英時闊，車身極爲穩定，在一小時六十英喱速率下，可不使放在窗前杯內的水濺出來，此車定貨則須一萬元美之耳。　（移酬濟赈）姑妄聽之——「魂歸故里」  王瑛元　　有這麼一件怪事，信者可作「心電無線電」之參考寶資料，不信的「姑妄聽之」吧！　　彻戰期間，一個陰曆十二月初旬的時節，在大後方一個大營房襄，有一位浙江籍的連長，得到了瀉肚子的毛病，因陰曆年關將屆，思家心切。「每逢佳節倍思親」，是人之常情，病勢舆日俱增，彼之同僚即電告病人原籍家屬——妻，至十二月卅日，醫藥罔效，氣絕身死，適有西醫在旁，認为體溫未降，可以施人工呼呼，於是敷分鐘後，呼吸繼續；因醫生之焦慮而設法，終於病勢日痊，至春則告復原。其妾亦於病應後，由浙趕來，雨人對話中，得到下述資料。　　病人問憶氣斷時，毫無痛苦，祗學得一口氣接不上來的時候，就覺得很輕的飄起來。因為想家，所以就走出營門，但家已在目前，敷千里的旅途，是無時間感覺的，抵家後好像身在雲端，眼見大門關閉，即由墻頭飛進走廊，見八歲長子凝立，呼喚不應，頗為詫異；

<h3>Unconfirmed Report of General Marshall's Imminent Return to the US; Five-Person Talks to Continue Today; Both Sides to Present Concrete Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The five-person negotiation committee, temporarily formed by representatives of the government and the Chinese Communist Party, spent the entire day today discussing all post-war issues in the Communist-controlled areas within and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass. It is said that both sides have agreed to resume the meeting at 4 PM tomorrow. According to neutral sources, the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will present more concrete proposals on various issues tomorrow for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The current Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have encountered new difficulties due to the scheduled convocation of the National Assembly. The CCP insists that the National Assembly be decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and considers it more important than the administrative authority over Northern Jiangsu. The government, on the other hand, believes that it should proceed step by step according to established policies.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Direct Kuomintang-Communist negotiations are underway, with both sides studying the situation separately today. However, it is rumored that both sides still adhere to their original positions, with no new ideas. Zhou Enlai visited General Marshall at 5:30 PM today and returned around 7 PM. The conversation covered the content of yesterday's meeting and the issue of convening the National Assembly, which was reported to General Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] It is confirmed that US Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, will not return to the US at this time because his mission is not yet complete. The reports carried by a few newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai a few days ago that General Marshall intended to return to the US in the short term are absolutely inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] General Marshall told our reporter that regarding the foreign press reports that he intended to return to the US in the short term, he had not yet made such a decision himself. Judging from this, the so-called news of General Marshall being weary of his mission is indeed baseless. Furthermore, our reporter learned that whether General Marshall can go to Beiping in the short term has not yet been determined. However, if the direct negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party achieve success on issues related to the ceasefire and military reorganization, then General Marshall, to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people, would not hesitate to embark on a long journey despite the summer heat and could go to North China and the Northeast at any time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Special Envoy Marshall has been in China for half a year. How long will he stay? This question has become a shadow over the difficult peace negotiations. To date, the only answer is that Special Envoy Marshall cannot stay in China indefinitely. Most observers today believe that the road to lasting peace in China is still long, no different from when Special Envoy Marshall first arrived in Chongqing. The government has announced that the National Assembly will be convened on November 12th of this year. Unless an agreement is reached before this date, the CCP may once again refuse to participate. If Special Envoy Marshall returns home early, the difficulty of selecting a suitable successor becomes another practical problem. Former US military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, is about to return to China. Considering his understanding of China, he is fully qualified to continue the mission, but in reality, the CCP may not be satisfied with him. Special Envoy Marshall's entourage has not hinted at any slight discouragement from Special Envoy Marshall regarding the promotion of peace in China, nor has General Marshall's prestige among the CCP leaders or the National Government leaders diminished. Those assisting Special Envoy Marshall in the negotiations believe that there is still a glimmer of hope for peace, and that Special Envoy Marshall should remain in office to complete his mission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] Representatives of the Democratic League, Luo Longji and Liang Shuming, visited Wu Tiecheng today, advocating that the PCC Comprehensive Group should hold a meeting immediately to resolve various outstanding issues. Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu are scheduled to hold a third meeting with Chen Cheng, Shao Lizi, and Wang Shijie tomorrow to discuss the issue of the National Assembly. Zhou Enlai's wife, Deng Yingchao, went to Shanghai today for a short stay.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] A senior Kuomintang official stated today that regarding the troop reorganization issue, the government hopes to reach an agreement with the Communist side within a week or ten days. However, this does not imply that the government is setting a deadline for resolving the issue.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Remaining in Nanjing Issue Declaration: People Expect Government Relief; Kuomintang-Communist Issue Needs Urgent Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The National Assembly Representatives Remaining in Nanjing Committee issued a declaration today stating: There should be a deadline for ceasefire and peace negotiations. The government should not adopt a non-aggression attitude as before the Sino-Japanese War, holding to the principle of "I will not offend others unless offended." The current situation is different from the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China rose up to "resist" because Japan invaded Chinese territory. Today, the Communist Party occupies a vast amount of land throughout the country. If both sides adopt a non-aggression attitude, does this mean that the government has recognized the Communist Party's occupied territories? The government stated in its June 30th ceasefire declaration that it hoped Special Envoy Marshall would continue to mediate to seek a peaceful resolution. But we should remember that Special Envoy Marshall's mediation has been going on for half a year, and peace is still not in sight. We must ask the government, how long will the negotiations continue? There are millions of refugees in China today, and the people under Communist rule are suffering even more. The people now expect the government to provide relief, just as infants look up to their mothers. The government not only fails to aid the people but also engages in slow negotiations. Does the government know that for every hour spent in negotiations, many innocent people die tragically? The three demands put forward by the government, such as permanently ending initial battles, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the military, have not been resolved during the five-day ceasefire period and the extended ceasefire period. Although the government has ordered that they must be resolved, there has been no concrete solution to date, nor has there been an agreement in principle. If the government is not very confident in its demands, it should not speak so strongly. Please make the negotiation process public and announce your future attitude so that the people can decide who is right and who is wrong. Democratic countries have no secret diplomacy. Should we have secret diplomacy in our internal affairs?</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Summons Lu Zuofu</h3>
<p>Listens to Report on Observations of American Shipping Industry</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 5th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Shipping Company, at 5 PM this afternoon, who recently returned from inspecting the shipping industry in the United States. He listened to Lu's report on his observations of the American shipping industry and inquired about various matters.</p>
<h3>Councilors Su Ting and Others Request Abolition of Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Embezzlement Case at Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Standing Committee of the Political Council passed the following motions at its fifth meeting today: (1) The motion proposed by Su Ting and others requesting the government to promptly abolish the Ministry of Food was passed as amended. (2) The motion proposed by Fu Sinian and others requesting the government to thoroughly punish the corrupt personnel who purchased materials at the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau and to commend the whistleblowers was resolved to be submitted to the government for earnest handling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Minister Wang Yun-wu reported on the recent economic measures at the Standing Committee of the Political Council today. Wang's report focused on the review of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' revenue collection and handling work, and future plans. Wang expressed "considerable satisfaction" with the current state of the China Textile Corporation (Chinatex).</p>
<h3>National Assembly Preparatory Work Completed Early; Interview with Secretary-General of Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The date for convening the National Assembly has been decided by the Supreme National Defense Council and set for November 12th of this year. In order to understand the preparations for the assembly, the reporter visited Hong You, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee. According to Hong, the preparatory work had been planned or completed early due to the importance of convening the assembly on May 5th. During the extended period, the preparatory committee, due to the possibility of the assembly being convened at any time, had tightened all work separately but had not stopped. Now that the date for convening the assembly has been re-established, based on the past preparations, plus the next four months, the progress can be properly determined, making the work of all departments more substantial, in order to make the preparatory affairs more perfect before the assembly.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Reorganization of Northeast Headquarters; Li Zongren to Depart for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 5th] Li Zongren will go to inspect various key points along the Beijing-Hankou Railway and Shanxi-Suiyuan region within days. The scheduled trip will last approximately one week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] The "World Daily" reported from Shenyang today that the Northeast Headquarters will be reorganized into three committees: Economic, Military, and Political. Commander-in-Chief of the Headquarters, Xiong Shihui, will serve as Chairman of the Political Committee. Du Yuming will remain Commander of the Northeast Security Forces. Zhang Jia'ao and Hu Zongnan will serve as Chairmen of the Economic and Military Committees, respectively.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Issues Statement; Very Optimistic About International Situation; Our Country Should Dedicate All Efforts to Construction</h3>
<p>[This City News] He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council and head of the Chinese military delegation to the United States, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the special "Triumph" train on the night of the 4th. When interviewed by the Central News Agency reporter yesterday, he said that people all over the world are now eager to realize lasting peace. China, as a peace-loving country, is very willing to work together with countries such as the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to promote world peace. Since everyone is mentally unprepared for war, there is no reason for war to occur. Therefore, I am very optimistic about the international situation. Speaking of domestic problems, He said: The government has consistently advocated resolving all problems through political means. As long as everyone truly puts the interests of the nation and the country first, any matter can be peacefully resolved. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek over the past eight years, we have completed the victory of the War of Resistance. In the future, we should devote all our efforts to construction and accelerate the work of rehabilitation. When the reporter asked He how the country's military education should be improved in the future, he said: To build a modern country, it is necessary to have a modern army and modern military education. It is necessary to develop industry, transportation, and all aspects of construction in a coordinated manner. Only by "enriching the country and strengthening the army" can we truly achieve "national wealth and military strength." Regarding the construction of the Northeast, He said that based on his observations, although the Northeast had been occupied for fourteen years, most of its industrial base had not been completely destroyed. If it is no longer damaged and the people of the country work together, it will only take seven years to achieve the initial ideal of revitalizing the Northeast and building the Northeast. Finally, He told the reporter affirmatively that if the people of the country are truly united and work together, China and the world will surely realize lasting peace. He is currently in Shanghai processing出国手续出国手 and will fly to New York to take office as soon as the seat is allocated. If he has any spare time before departure, he will hold a press conference.</p>

<h3>Introducing International Trade Plans, Conclusions Reached at Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its eighth meeting on the morning of the 5th, chaired by Xiao Zheng. The main topic of discussion was "Improving International Trade Plans." The conclusions reached were: (1) China's foreign trade should adopt planned free trade; (2) Tariff rates for imports should be differentiated based on their importance, and restrictions should be imposed through means other than tariffs. Export tariff rates should be reduced as much as possible; (3) Foreign exchange management should coordinate imports and exports proportionally, and foreign trade organizations should be strengthened to provide guidance. The Bureau of Commodity Inspection should be reorganized into a state-owned enterprise. In the afternoon, at the ninth meeting, chaired by Wang Yunwu, the original topic of discussion was "Review of Economic Laws and Economic Administration." However, due to the many days of meetings, most committee members felt that the general issues had not been fully explored and opinions were not fully expressed. Therefore, the original topic was reserved for post-conference written opinions from committee members. This final meeting was still devoted to general discussion. Committee members spoke one after another, adding many insightful supplements to the various issues discussed over the past four days. The atmosphere at the meeting this morning was exceptionally harmonious, and the committee members shared a consensus on various points for developing international trade. During the meeting, Huang Yuanbin, An Shukang, Zhuang Zhihuan, Wu Qiyuan, Xu Jiqing, Ji Naiqi, and others discussed with particular enthusiasm the rational restrictions on imports, the encouragement of exports, and the competition for the Southeast Asian market. Pan Zheng, representing the Ministry of Finance, also offered explanations regarding the prevalence of smuggling. Jin Shixuan, representing the Ministry of Communications, explained that the high freight costs for current exports were mainly due to loading and unloading fees, rather than normal transportation fees. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. At the afternoon meeting, speakers included committee members such as Hu Juewen, Hu Qian'ang, Zhang Naiqi, Li Junlong, Cui Weiwo, Li Zhuchen, and Wu Yunshu. Some committee members reiterated that the enemy and puppet factories and mines should be restored quickly or returned to their original owners, and that the current situation should be investigated. However, some committee members pointed out that in light of the current economic crisis, considering China's situation over the past century, it was already possible to embark on the path of development. Finally, after reviewing the issue of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which was soon to resume operations, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The New Administration of Xinjiang</h3>
<p>The newly appointed members of the Xinjiang Provincial Government were sworn into office in Dihua on the first of this month. President Yu Youren of the Supervisory Yuan, specially dispatched by the Central Government to oversee the oath-taking ceremony, expressed great hope for the future Xinjiang Provincial Government. Mr. Yu stated that the future Xinjiang government is a democratic government, and there will no longer be friction between ethnic groups. The people of Xinjiang will forever be free from the suffering of darkness, war, and lack of freedom. According to reports, the oath was divided into two versions: Chairman Zhang Zhizhong led the recitation of the oath in Chinese, and Vice Chairman Akhmetjan Qasimi led the recitation of the oath in Uyghur. The holding of this oath-taking ceremony represents the implementation of the new administration in Xinjiang, which is a landmark measure with profound significance. As the delegates to the National Assembly from Xinjiang come to Shanghai, we would like to express our expectations for the future of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The establishment of Xinjiang Province dates back to the Qing Dynasty. At that time, after a period of chaos, Governor-General Zuo Zongtang, who was in charge of the administration, was quite talented and resourceful, determined to govern, and all policies began to take shape. Zuo's policy of governing Xinjiang did not ask whether one was Han or Hui, but only whether one was causing chaos. The significance of this lay in eliminating hatred among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which was an enlightened ethnic policy. The residents of Xinjiang were originally extremely diverse, including local Han Chinese, local Han Hui, and native Chan Hui, also known as the Uyghur people, or the Uyghur people of the Yuan Dynasty, the Huihe people of the Tang Dynasty. In addition, there were also nomadic Mongols, Tatars, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Tash people, etc. With so many ethnic groups living in one area, disputes were naturally likely to arise. After the Xinhai Revolution, due to Xinjiang's location on the frontier and the central government's inability to reach it, the administration of Xinjiang gradually formed a situation of local separatist warlord rule. During this period, disturbances occurred repeatedly, the most famous being the Rebellion in Southern Xinjiang, and as recently as the Yining Incident. Since the disputes that occurred in Yining in July of the 33rd year of the Republic, the situation gradually escalated, and for a time, there were rumors of organizing a "Republic of East Turkestan." In September of last year, the Central Government specially dispatched General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang to handle the disputes, and then appointed Mr. Zhang as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, repeatedly holding consultations with representatives from Yining. On January 2nd of this year, the main text of the Reconciliation Terms for the Yining Dispute, consisting of eleven articles, was signed in Dihua. At the same time, an appendix was established, and on June 6th of this year, a second appendix was established. After being approved by the Central Government, it was announced in Nanjing on the 29th of last month. With this, the Xinjiang issue was completely resolved.</p>
<p>Based on the Reconciliation Terms and appendices, the Xinjiang Provincial Government immediately underwent reorganization. In order to coordinate the border people and stabilize the border regions, the Xinjiang Provincial Government implemented an expanded organization, with representatives from various ethnic groups participating. In addition to Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, who also serves as the Director of the Northwest Headquarters, there are also two vice chairmen, Bao Erhan of the Tatar ethnic group and Akhmetjan Qasimi of the Uyghur ethnic group. There is also one secretary-general, Liu Mengchun of Guangdong, and two deputy secretaries-general, Salisi of the Kazakh ethnic group and Abdulkerim Abbasov of the Uyghur ethnic group. In addition, there are 19 committee members, appointed by people from the Han, Han Hui, Uyghur, Mongol Banner, Kazakh, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. Among them, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs is Han Chinese, with one Deputy Director being Uyghur; the Director of the Department of Finance is Han Chinese, with one Deputy Director being Han Hui; the Director of the Department of Education is Uyghur, with one Deputy Director being Han Chinese; the Director of the Department of Construction is Uyghur, with one Deputy Director being Han Chinese; the Director of the Department of Social Affairs is Han Chinese, with the Deputy Director belonging to the Mongol Banner; the Director of the Department of Health is Kazakh, with no Deputy Director; the Mayor of Dihua is concurrently held by a Han member of the provincial government. It can be seen that after this reorganization, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have participated in the government. The Reconciliation Terms and appendices also stipulate that all ethnic groups have the right to autonomous elections, that the government should eliminate religious discrimination, granting the people complete freedom to believe in their religion, that government agency documents should be written in both Chinese and Hui languages, that people may use their own languages independently, that schools may use their own languages for teaching, but Chinese should be a required subject in middle schools, that the government should ensure the free development of ethnic culture and art, and that armed forces of various ethnic groups who participated in the incident should be allowed to be reorganized into three infantry regiments and three cavalry regiments, with two cavalry regiments and one infantry regiment being national troops and the rest being local security forces.</p>
<p>After this reorganization, Xinjiang has entered a new era, characterized by the realization of freedom and equality for all ethnic groups. This is a clear example of the government and the people starting anew. In the past, the reason why disputes arose frequently in Xinjiang was that the various ethnic groups distrusted each other, and those in charge of the administration were often unable to take into account the feelings of the various ethnic groups and properly mediate, leading to major changes due to minor causes. Now, the government is handling border affairs based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, using them to harmonize all ethnic groups, so that the Xinjiang issue can be completely and satisfactorily resolved. The principle of nationalism in the Three Principles of the People originally had two aspects, internal and external. The internal aspect seeks freedom and equality for the Chinese nation, while the external aspect seeks freedom and equality for the various ethnic groups that make up the Chinese nation. Based on this spirit, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, held in Chongqing this March, made important decisions on border affairs, reaffirming the government's enlightened ethnic policy. This newspaper published an article on March 21st commenting that the border policy decided by the Second Plenary Session was not only sufficient to show concern for compatriots in the border regions but also opened up a broad avenue for their future development. Now that we have seen the new atmosphere in Xinjiang, we are even more reminded that the truth of nationalism is inherently indestructible. As long as it is sincerely implemented, any complex problem can be solved.</p>
<p>The implementation of this new administration, based on the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the instructions of the Chairman, demonstrates the government's determination to protect the autonomous rights of all ethnic groups in the border regions. This is an example of political democratization and the nationalization of the military. In the future, with the new administration unfolded, with all ethnic groups working together in freedom and equality, not only can past suspicions and jealousies be eliminated, but they will also be able to move forward with sincerity and solidarity, strengthening our borders, under the belief of mutual assistance, cooperation, benevolence, and peace. How to improve politics, utilize resources, develop transportation, and strengthen the relationship between the border provinces and the interior to build a new Xinjiang, we believe that under the coordinated guidance of Chairman Zhang and the committee members of various ethnic groups, it will be actively unfolded. We especially admire General Zhang Zhizhong's repeated efforts to mediate the Xinjiang issue, working hard for the country. The new administration of Xinjiang has begun. We hope that this spirit of harmony and coordination can build a new Xinjiang and further extend this spirit of coordination to the whole country, building a new China!</p>

<h3>Tanaka Admits in International Court: The Process of Japan's Conspiracy Against China; Kido Diary Reveals Behind-the-Scenes Politics; Colonel Kawamoto Was the Mastermind Behind the Assassination of Zhang Zuolin</h3>
<p>[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] The International Court continued to call witnesses this morning. When Okada Keisuke of China rose to testify, the American prosecutor, Sackett, submitted excerpts from the defendant Hashimoto's book "Advice to Young People" as documentary evidence, stating that it was sufficient to prove that the defendant Hashimoto had planned the Northeast Incident, destroyed the international disarmament treaty, and planned various conspiracies domestically. Then, Yamanaka Ryukichi, the former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, testified. Tanaka stated directly as follows: "At that time, Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Honjo, and Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Saito, were not involved. The planner of the incident was then Senior Staff Officer of the Kwantung Army, Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku. At that time, in response to the Tanaka Cabinet's proactive policy on the Northeast issue, he planned to disarm Zhang Zuolin's vehicle in the west of Jinzhou, who was retreating from the Pingjin area. The purpose was to force Zhang Zuolin to step down, make Zhang Xueliang the master of the Northeast, separate from the Nanjing government, and make the Northeast not only peaceful but also under Japanese control. However, this plan was strictly prohibited by the Tanaka Cabinet, but Kawamoto still wanted to achieve the goal of supporting Zhang Xueliang, so he blew up the train carrying Zhang Zuolin on June 3, 1927. The bombers were one officer, one non-commissioned officer, and soldiers from the engineering regiment dispatched from Keijo, Korea, to the Northeast at that time."</p>
<p>Military Rampancy</p>
<p>[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] International Court Prosecutor Sackett today presented the diary of Marquis Kido, a Class A war criminal, to the court as evidence. The diary is one of the most important pieces of evidence in this Tokyo trial, totaling more than 5,000 pages. Kido served as Minister of State and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. His diary details the secret history of his interaction within political circles. Prosecutors and defense attorneys alike considered it an extremely valuable source. According to Kido's diary, on the day the September 18th Incident occurred, he, then Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino Nobuaki, Minister of the Imperial Household Iki Kitokuro, and others discussed the Shenyang Incident. That night, he received a phone call from Harada, the secretary of Duke Saionji, who said that Saionji instructed him to pay attention to the incident of the Japanese army in Korea invading the Northeast without the permission of the Emperor. On September 19, Prime Minister Wakatsuki met with the Emperor and said, "The policy is to prevent the situation from expanding further, and to stop as soon as our army gains a superior position." That night, Harada told him, "I met the Prime Minister today, and he said that the military's attitude is very tough, and the matters decided by the cabinet cannot reach the frontline troops, which is quite troubling. He talked about whether there is a good way to control the military, and intends to ask Prince Kan'in to work hard, or to invite the elders to come to the capital." On November 14, he met with Yasui Masaatsu, Yoshida Shigeru, and Arima Fumio to review the current situation. Yasui said that the military's actions have become increasingly active recently, and more and more vagrant students are also participating, so it is urgent to study countermeasures. On November 15, Director of Military Affairs Bureau Hayashi said: "If the resolution of the Northeast issue is delayed for a long time, it will also be inappropriate in terms of the military's control regulations, so there are preparations to establish a new regime in the Northeast," implying the military's attempt to establish a puppet regime in the Northeast.</p>

<h3>After the City Government Implemented Rationing; Rice Black Market Still Rampant; Citizens Should Pay Attention to Four Points! If Rice Shops Have No Rice to Sell, They Can Immediately Request to See the Account Books for Inspection</h3>
<p>The city's rice supply is increasing daily. Rice from various places has been transported in large quantities. Large quantities of Jiangxi rice and Vietnamese rice have begun to be fully distributed to rice shops by the Social Affairs Bureau to meet the needs of the citizens. Yesterday, 7,000 bags of Vietnamese rice (about 9,000 piculs) were distributed and sold by various rice shops, while the city's daily sales are still less than this number (daily sales of about 5,000 piculs). Therefore, the supply is very sufficient, and rice shops should no longer have a shortage of rice to sell. Starting today, 5,000 piculs of Jiangxi rice will be distributed, and in the future, rice will continue to be shipped in and distributed in proportion to actual needs. The China National Food Corporation is currently working hard to purchase foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply. It is reported that large quantities of Siamese and Brazilian rice will arrive in Shanghai in succession. However, the rice black market is still very rampant. Some rice shops are selling the rice allocated by the government on the black market to obtain huge profits. The city government and the Social Affairs Bureau have dispatched personnel to conduct strict investigations. From today onwards, citizens are urged to pay attention to the following items when purchasing rice: (1) When going to a rice shop to buy rice, pay attention to whether various types of rice are marked with the place of origin, quality, and price. (2) If the rice shop has no rice for sale, you can ask the rice shop to show the account books to check the quantity allocated to it, and the invoice stubs of who it was sold to. (3) If citizens find that the rice shop does not mark the place of origin, quality, and price for the rice it sells, or refuses to sell rice, they can report the facts to the city government or the Social Affairs Bureau. (4) If the rice shop only sells at black market prices, citizens should also report the matter to the city government or the Social Affairs Bureau after purchasing the rice.</p>
<p>In addition, Mayor Wu stated at a meeting of foreign reporters yesterday regarding the city's food problem: If Shanghai's rice supply cannot be handled well, the entire city will have problems. The city government will conduct a large-scale investigation of the relief books of various rice shops. If it is discovered that they are selling on the black market, they will be severely punished. The Jiangxi rice distributed yesterday was brown rice, and the allocation price per picul has been reduced to 42,000 yuan, which is 4,000 yuan cheaper than before. When rice shops sell it, they can add 6%, legal profit, and freight, so the price per picul is about 46,000 to 47,000 yuan. Therefore, this can also lower the city's rice prices, and brown rice is rich in vitamins.</p>

<h3>Workers of Shanghai Brewery Company Petition to Retain German Technician</h3>
<p>[Our News] More than 300 workers of the Shanghai Brewery Company went on strike yesterday. Dividing themselves among three freight trucks plastered with slogans, they paraded around the city from morning until dusk and petitioned the External Affairs Office in Shanghai, requesting a postponement of the repatriation of the factory's German brewmaster, Oppenheimer. The factory workers believe that if Mr. Oppenheimer returns to his country, the factory will inevitably face technical difficulties and be forced to close, leading to unemployment. They collectively requested the External Affairs Office to postpone the repatriation. The person in charge of the office ordered a request to be made to the U.S. Consulate General. According to the workers, the consulate has already written a letter explaining the situation and instructed them to take it to the External Affairs Office for further processing.

Mr. Oppenheimer joined the factory in 1936. Whether there are other reasons for this matter is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Dr. Hu Shih Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Bringing a Large Volume of the "History of Chinese Thought"; After Nine Years of Separation, Chatting and Laughing; Wishing to Teach More in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our News] Dr. Hu Shih, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, after embarking on the Taft Presidential liner in New York on June 5th of this year to return to the country, arrived at the Wusongkou in this city at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Fuyun, the Customs Commissioner, specially sent a small tugboat to welcome him. When the bell of the Jianghai Customs sounded nine times, amidst the lights of thousands of homes, Mr. Hu was finally seen carrying multiple boxes of manuscripts and books brought from the United States, stepping onto the Haihong Wharf. He immediately took a car to the seventeenth floor of the Broadway Mansion for temporary residence.</p>
<p>The reporter immediately visited Mr. Hu at his temporary residence. Mr. Hu flew from Hong Kong to the United States on September 20th, 1937, and it has been nine years in the blink of an eye. This time, he has returned gracefully, his temples already showing some gray, but his face is fuller than before, and his spirit is exceptionally vigorous. Mr. Hu was wearing a blue-gray summer suit, with a blue-based white-dotted thin tie. He still wore his familiar tortoiseshell glasses on the bridge of his nose, chatting and laughing with the visiting relatives and friends, still exuding the demeanor of a refined scholar.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said to the reporter with a smile: "For the past three and a half years, I have rarely left the house, burying myself in the study of historical research. I have compiled the materials from my lectures at Harvard and Columbia Universities into a large volume of the 'History of Chinese Thought.' Therefore, I have rarely heard about foreign affairs, and because I have been separated from my homeland for many years, I also feel unfamiliar with the domestic situation."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said: "The American government and people have great expectations for me, hoping that my country will have a bright future after the war." When the reporter asked Mr. Hu about his thoughts on his homeland, Mr. Hu replied: "My country has suffered an unprecedented blow from this national crisis, and I also deeply hope that my country will have a bright future!"</p>
<p>Recently, the National Government announced the appointment of Mr. Hu as the President of National Peking University. When the reporter inquired about this with Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu said that he did not know the details. However, he earnestly told the reporter: "In the future, it would be best to teach more and not be involved in administrative matters."</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu went to the United States in 1937, he initially had the mission of a "cultural ambassador," engaging in liaison work with leaders in the American cultural and educational circles. The following year, he assumed the important task of Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Hu is the first person in our country to serve as an ambassador to a foreign country with the identity of a literary figure and philosopher. He served in office for a total of four years.</p>
<p>Those who went to the wharf yesterday to welcome Mr. Hu included Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu, and Mr. Hu's son, Hu Zuwang. Mr. Hu's wife, Ms. Jiang Dongxiu, specially rushed from Luzhou to Shanghai last Saturday. It is said that Mr. Hu will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Nanjing and then to Peiping with his wife.</p>

<h3>Under the Dumping of Foreign Paper, Many Private Paper Mills Shut Down</h3>
<p>[Our News] According to Xu Huanming, Deputy Manager of the China Paper Industry Company, China's paper industry is currently facing the most serious crisis. Because foreign goods have been pouring in since the victory, the cost of Chinese paper is high, and the products cannot compete with foreign goods. There is no guarantee of sales, so most paper mills have fallen into a state of stagnation. There are currently twenty-one paper mills in Shanghai, seventeen of which are privately owned and four of which are state-owned, directly under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Except for state-owned factories that must be maintained regardless of profit or loss, several private paper mills have already closed down, and others have entered a state of semi-stagnation. Mr. Xu said that the import of foreign goods is enough to manipulate the fate of the domestic paper industry, and the future of China's paper industry depends on the solution of the entire economic problem.</p>

<h3>Yuan Ludeng's Disciple, Cheng Zhiliang, Interrogated by the Court of Appeal; "Social Secretary" Still Making Excuses</h3>

<p>Slight Changes in the Election Method for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>According to Article 9 of the Organizational Regulations of the Municipal Council, "The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council shall be elected by the Municipal Councilors through secret ballot. When the Speaker or Deputy Speaker leaves office due to an accident, a by-election shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph." There were no previous regulations on how to calculate the number of votes for election. Recently, the Ministry of Interior has supplemented and clarified the election method, and slight changes have been made. The original telegram is reproduced as follows: "Upon investigation, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Provincial and Municipal Councils should be elected separately by secret ballot with consecutive voting. Each candidate must receive more than half of the votes of the attendees to be elected. If no one is elected in the first election, a second election should be held, and the candidate with the most votes will be elected. If the votes are tied, the decision will be made by drawing lots. However, the Speakers and Deputy Speakers who have been elected before this method is implemented shall remain valid and need not be re-elected."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>After the Agricultural Products Market is Abolished, a Jointly Operated Market is Being Organized</p>
<p>The Greatest Difficulty is the Lack of Suitable Site</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] Since the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market was abolished, the city's vegetable and produce industry, in order to seek collective operation for the benefit of all vendors, has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval to establish a preparatory office for a jointly operated market for the Shanghai Vegetable and Produce Industry.</p>
<p>The Joint Operation Has Been Uniquely Approved</p>
<p>The Northern and Southern markets of the industry have jointly elected eleven representatives to serve as preparatory committee members. Yesterday, in order to understand the preparation situation of the market, the reporter made a special visit to Shen Jichao, a member of the preparatory committee. He said that since the establishment of the preparatory office, it has been actively preparing in the hope of early establishment. However, the original site, buildings, docks, and other facilities of the agricultural products market need to be investigated and returned to the original owners separately, so the site of the jointly operated market has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>Plan to Lease the Old Site</p>
<p>It has now been requested that the society instruct the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market Liquidation Committee to allow the market to continue to rent the original occupied sites of the jointly operated markets established by the former agricultural products market in the four districts of No. 16 Luban Road in the Southern City, Guangfu Road in Zhabei, Bailinan Road in the Western Shanghai, and the west end of Dapu Bridge before they are investigated and dealt with, in order to facilitate business operations.</p>
<p>Eleven Preparatory Members</p>
<p>The current persons in charge of the Southern City Market are Shen Jichao, Ma Wenbiao, Sa Xiancheng, Qi Sipin, Yan Muzhen, and six others. The Northern City Market includes Shen Jiaobin, Fei Zhenbi, Jin Weiyu, Shen Shengan, Wang Chuqing, and five others.</p>
<p>Vegetable Consumption</p>
<p>The consumption of vegetables in this city is surprisingly large. According to investigations, the value of vegetables transported from the surrounding suburbs to the urban area every day is about 60 million yuan in the Southern City, about 50 million yuan in the Northern City, about 30 million yuan in Pudong, about 20 million yuan in Jiangwan, about 15 million yuan each in Zhoujiaqiao and Zhenru, about 5 million yuan in Dapu Bridge, totaling 200 million yuan. And the actual money spent by citizens on vegetables every day is even greater, reaching about 600 million yuan. The difference of 400 million yuan is the cost of vegetables, the commission of merchants, and the interest of vegetable vendors. Among them, the commission and the interest of vegetable vendors are the main reasons why vegetable prices are difficult to fall.</p>
<p>Wholesale Prices</p>
<p>Here are some comparisons of the wholesale prices of ordinary vegetables: eggplant is only 12,600 yuan per dan, Welsh onion is 5,000 yuan, tomatoes are 32,500 yuan, winter melon is 9,000 yuan, Chinese cabbage is 11,000 yuan, cucumbers are 13,500 yuan, cabbage is 6,000 yuan, onions are 11,000 yuan. What are the current retail prices?</p>
<p>Commissions Should Be Reduced</p>
<p>During the enemy and puppet Central Market period, commissions were as high as 28%. After the victory and restoration, the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Products Market was organized, and commissions were reduced, but they still reached 16%. Vegetable vendors increased costs, so they also arbitrarily raised their profits. Since the agricultural products market was abolished, everything has been let go. Some unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise commissions.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu took office, he was very concerned about rice prices and vegetable market prices. If the vegetable and produce market is established, it is hoped that there will be legal regulations on commissions and vegetable vendor profits to suppress vegetable prices and reduce the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>Public Bonds Mixed, But Overall Group C is Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Public bonds suddenly declined yesterday, but domestic bonds were lively again. The situation is still stable. Retail investors base their psychology on the proximity of the repayment period, so Groups A and B are despised first. This is also the recent trend of speculative psychology. However, knowledgeable people do not agree, so trading is still sporadic. As a result, Group C is relatively stable, and Groups A, B, and D fell by 100 yuan each. Group E fell by 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Show Mixed Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Most Still Affected by Tight Credit</p>
<p>The money market in Chinese stocks was initially stable yesterday, followed by tightness. Investors made different choices, so large stocks were more popular, while small stocks were despised again. At one point, the strongest stocks were Sishui Yarn at 460 yuan, Mei Ya at 2880 yuan, Jingfu at 208 yuan, Xinguang at 227 yuan, and Qindian at 185 yuan. At noon, large stocks were fluctuating in the middle, while small stocks struggled to catch up with the morning's low prices. The situation for unpopular stocks was pessimistic. As a result, compared with the previous day, Yongshui Yarn and Mei Ya continued to rise slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qindian declined slightly. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks all fell, and veteran stocks also felt unsupported.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially stable yesterday. Yisha fluctuated around 8500 yuan, and Yinglian fluctuated around 8200 yuan. Near the close, credit became even tighter, and large dealers in the industry were forced to cut their holdings to protect themselves. Bidding prices turned sharply downward. There was limited trading in Asia Steel and Ye Guang, and market prices did not change much. Most of the popular stocks were weak. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha and Yibei Paper fell slightly. Yinglian and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent. Asia Steel and Ye Guang did not have much time, so there was not much change.</p>
<p>Britain Plans to Dispose of Silver</p>
<p>To Promote Export Trade</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] According to the Silver Quarterly of the Montagu Company, the British Treasury, in addition to assisting necessary industries, is now prepared to use 1,000,000 taels of silver to promote export trade, of which 600,000 taels are silver tableware and 400,000 taels are semi-finished products. The Treasury plans to place all exported silver under this plan.</p>
<p>Tight Credit, Both Gold and Paper Money are Weak</p>
<p>Gold was peaceful yesterday. The market opened flat and tight in the morning. The opening price fell slightly to 1.92 million. The financial atmosphere was slightly eased. Later, it rose slightly. After 10 o'clock, the central bank distributed 90 bars, and the price also increased slightly to 1.9325 million. Scattered traders gradually increased, and the market rebounded to around 1.945 million, then some high-level suppliers emerged. At noon, it fell back to below 1.93 million. The afternoon was very flat. Day-to-day trading opened slightly higher, but people became nervous again, and finally fell back to 1.905 million. As a result, compared with the previous close, it continued to fall by 20,000. Gold ornaments were stable at 10,040, and silver dollars were also flat. The black market interest rate remained tight, with interest rates ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The US dollar was tight and high. Investors continued to raise prices of goods in the US, and inflation was more severe. The problem of positions was still fatal. Not only the US dollar, but also all other foreign currencies were involved in the vortex. The US dollar opened at around 2530 yuan yesterday, and briefly rose to over 2550 yuan in the middle of the day. It lingered around the morning opening price near noon, and was weak in the afternoon. As a result, it fell 30 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also facing more supply than demand, and the price fell from 540 yuan to 525 yuan, also falling 15 yuan. The money market was tight, and foreign exchange was also facing more supply than demand. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 660 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 89,000. There was less supply than demand. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<p>More Monks Than Rice</p>
<p>Rice Shops Demand Universal Allocation</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That a Large Batch of Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai This Month</p>
<p>Sales of Flour and Miscellaneous Grains are Stagnant</p>
<p>The number of customer registrations in the rice market yesterday did not increase, and there was little trading among the industry. The market situation was rarely changed. The number of rice shops requesting allocation increased. Yesterday, the North and South rice markets allocated a total of 4,000 dan of Vietnamese rice to various rice shops, at a price of 46,000 yuan. The stagnation of flour sales continued, and the price fell by another 800-900 yuan. Small manufacturers stopped production, and there was very little activity from retail investors. There was still a lack of formal trading, and the price was reduced by more than 1,000 yuan. The oil market had more supply than demand, and continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by 100 yuan. High-quality soybeans were firm, and medium- and low-quality soybeans fell by 500-600 yuan. Soybean sales were stagnant, and prices were flat and weak.</p>
<p>The China Grain Industry Corporation and other agencies, in order to relieve the domestic food shortage, have ordered a large amount of foreign rice from South America and other countries with surplus grain. This foreign rice has now been shipped to China. In addition, a large amount of foreign rice from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will also arrive soon. According to statistics, 200,000 dan will arrive within half a month. Relevant parties have received telegrams and are planning distribution and pricing methods.</p>
<p>Recent Prices of Tung Oil and Hog Bristles in the New York Market</p>
<p>The foreign affairs department of the Bank of China believes that domestic exports of tung oil and hog bristles have been quite high recently, and domestic exporters need to understand the prices of these goods in the United States. It has cabled someone in New York to be responsible for reporting regularly. According to the telegram, on July 1, the old price of sufficient tung oil in New York was US$0.38-0.39 per pound for bulk oil tankers and US$0.39-0.41 per pound for drums. This is the price limit set in 1942. Since the silver price was cancelled, no accurate market price has been seen. The price of Hankou hog bristles for delivery in New York (CAF. New York) is US$4 per pound for 70%, and the price of Shanghai 70% is US$2.3 per pound. The market needs Hankou hog bristles more.</p>
<p>The Money Market is Still Tight</p>
<p>There is No Improvement in Yarn and Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, yarn and cloth still lacked signs of improvement. The financial storm had not subsided, and sales were weak. People in the industry who wanted to sell their goods and make money were still flooding the market, causing 20-count yarn to fall by 30,000 again, and small and medium-sized miscellaneous brands also fell by 20,000-30,000. There was no improvement in fine yarn and thread. The future of the yarn market is to wait for the relaxation of credit and the expansion of sales before there is hope for recovery. At noon, the Textile Construction Company continued to lower the yarn price by 20,000-100,000 as usual.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton market was closed due to the celebration of Independence Day, and there was no news. The current cotton trading in this port, although gold is expensive, credit is still tight, so some manufacturers are still slightly waiting and seeing. Therefore, trading has declined somewhat. Only the Shenxin No. 1 Factory imported a small amount of NT. In addition, the flower shop had some decorative trading. The market price was stable.</p>
<p>Sales of cloth were not smooth, and were still affected by tight credit. Most floating households sold out, but the Shilin cloth was largely absorbed by all households, and the selling price was stable. However, grey cloth and bleached cloth continued to fall by 250-500 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation did not change much from the previous day.</p>
<p>Deed Registration for Real Estate as Collateral Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>The Trust Department of the Bank of China Can Handle It on Behalf</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The current real estate industry is sluggish, directly affecting housing problems and indirectly affecting financial and investment problems. Deeds and other land title certificates have always been the most reliable collateral in this city. Invisibly, anyone with these certificates can immediately turn them into cash. When there is excess floating capital, real estate is often the most reliable option. Since the Land Administration Bureau promulgated registration regulations after the restoration, there have been many obstacles in practice. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign landlords are waiting and seeing. Recently, there have been many rumors about these problems. In order to report clearly and truthfully, the reporter visited Mr. Shu Fengxiong, a leader in the real estate industry. He was received and gave a detailed account: foreign deeds, such as those from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, have not yet complied with the registration order due to treaty relations. Since Mayor Wu and Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau took office, they have invited relevant consuls to discuss the matter, and there are now concrete solutions.</p>
<p>For all foreign-owned deeds, if the property rights are indeed owned by merchants and citizens of their own country, the owners can apply for registration with the local Land Administration Bureau after obtaining a certificate from their own country's consul, and exchange it for a title deed.</p>
<p>Chinese-owned deeds, whether they are English, American, French, Belgian, Japanese, etc., can be submitted to. For the convenience of owners, the Trust Department of the Bank of China can be entrusted to handle the matter on their behalf. The procedures are convenient and the fees are low. For owners from England, America, France, and other countries that have signed new treaties, if there are any unclear points in terms of language and procedures, they can also entrust the Trust Department of the Bank of China to handle them on their behalf to facilitate matters.</p>
<p>If there are outstanding debts between the registered merchants and the owners, such as registration fees and advanced land tax and other fees, they should be handled directly by the registered merchants and the owners. This is not related to the government's registration this time. The above procedures are simple and easy to handle. Compared with the original regulations, they have been more flexible. Moreover, the government is determined to promote land administration. It is hoped that all owners will no longer wait and see, so as to avoid losses after the deadline.</p>
<p>Not Much Trading in the Sugar Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, brown and white sugar were slightly tight, but in the end, due to tight credit, there was not much trading. The association's current price for spot brown and white sugar was initially 100,700 yuan, then it was slightly lower. The closing price was 6,000-6,500 yuan. The stack price was 100,500-4,500 yuan, up 3,000-4,000 yuan. The dark price for road goods was initially slightly higher by 1,000-2,000 yuan, but it remained good later, without rising or falling, but it was still not as high as the opening price. Raw sugar was 100,250 yuan. The goods from Shantou opened with dozens of bags of ordinary yellow beans, 88,000 yuan. Jian opened with forty bags, 90,000 yuan. The market was flat and weak.</p>
<p>US Prices Have Begun to Rise</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Labor Statistics Bureau announced that the prices of 28 daily necessities suddenly rose by 3% on Wednesday. Since price controls were lifted on June 30, prices have risen by a total of 8%. The index listed by the bureau was 215.4 on Wednesday, while it was only 199.4 on the last day of price controls.</p>
<p>American Merchants Seek Chinese Camphor and Other Exporters</p>
<p>According to the external affairs department of the Bank of China, Magnus Mabee &amp; Reynard Company of New York is seeking to trade with reputable and important export companies in China that deal in camphor, peppermint oil, anise oil, cinnamon oil, and musk. The company's annual sales in the United States reach US$10 million. Operating exporters in this city and other places can contact the international affairs department of the Bank of China.</p>

<p>24th International Cooperative Day</p>
<p>Dedication</p>
<p>The New Mission of the International Cooperative Movement at the Present Stage</p>
<p>By Chen Zhongming</p>
<p>Grasping the historical regularity of all development stages is the prerequisite for the study of all historical topics. As democratic politics triumphs over dictatorial politics and the United Nations rebuilds the foundation of world peace, the 20,000 cooperators around the world, regardless of race or nationality, who share the common pursuit of human justice and the protection of world peace, joyfully welcome the 24th International Cooperative Day. Undoubtedly, this has epoch-making historical significance.</p>
<p>As early as a century ago, in 1835, Robert Owen, the founder of the world cooperative movement, organized the Association of All Classes of All Nations in London, attempting to use the power of international cooperation to eliminate human exploitation and war and realize his utopian cooperative ideal. Owen's world organization was the most primitive form of international cooperation.</p>
<p>From Owen's Association of All Classes of All Nations to the International Cooperative Alliance, the development of the international cooperative movement to the present stage can be divided into four stages for study, so that we can gain a correct understanding of the basic content and new tasks of each development stage and more confidently open up its bright future.</p>
<p>From the establishment of the International Cooperative Alliance in 1895 to the holding of the conference in Münster in 1902, this was the embryonic stage of the international cooperative movement. During this stage of development, the ideal and methods of international cooperation were determined. The main content was to promote the cooperative movement to break away from the narrow scope of nationalism and regionalism and leap into an international cooperative alliance without race or nationality. This progressive change, from the perspective of cooperative republic and world harmony, from individual to collective, from various countries to international unity, undeniably achieved a significant task. Although Rochdale may be judged by history today as a wrong path, at the time when capitalism was just emerging, the Rochdale pioneers did indeed make considerable and valuable enlightenment work for the vast working masses who were plunged into hunger and cold by the surge of the industrial revolution. The charter of the International Cooperative Alliance included the following provisions: "The purpose of this association is to inherit the work plans of the Rochdale pioneers and to replace the current competitive system of private enterprises with an independent spirit and its own methods, basing the interests of this whole society on the cooperative system of self-help and mutual assistance." This is obviously an abstract statement, but it is enough to illustrate the contradiction between the international cooperative movement and the existing private system and the tasks it bears. As the late Secretary-General of the International Cooperative Alliance, Mr. May, said: "To unite the people of the world and increase the happiness of individuals; at the same time, to create the civilization of the</p>

<h3>Nanshi Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau Solves a Robbery Case in Ten Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 11:00 PM on the 2nd, the home of Wu Baolin at No. 24 Wu Family Lane in Nanshi was suddenly invaded by a group of bandits, each wielding firearms. Under the guise of searching for traitors, they demanded a ransom of ten million yuan unsuccessfully. They immediately robbed the family of 400,000 yuan in legal tender and three gold bracelets, weighing approximately three taels. After the incident, the victim reported to the Yimiao Sub-Bureau. Criminal Division Officer Wan Fu, led police chief Yang Qingquan, police officers Ju [name incomplete], Qian Wumin, and Li Xuewei, to the scene for a detailed investigation. They discovered that Hu Dexiang at No. 71 of the same lane was highly suspicious. They searched Hu and found 20,000 yuan in serial-numbered new legal tender, which the victim confirmed was part of the stolen property. Hu was arrested and interrogated by Sub-Bureau Chief Shen himself. Subsequently, Deputy Sub-Bureau Chief Chen led [officers] to set out before dawn, arresting Han Yonggen, Zhang Ziming, Wang Zhangcheng, Wang Genxin, and two others at Wutong Street, Qinglian Street, Guangdong Road, and Beijing Road, respectively. All confessed to the crime, and the stolen goods were recovered. The bureau praised its officers for solving the entire case within ten hours of receiving the report, and for arresting the bandits in seven different locations within four hours. The investigative personnel were commended for their swiftness in solving the case and their diligent work.</p>
<h3>Gas Supply Falls Short of Demand; Plans to Establish a New Plant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Mr. Spielkins, an engineer from the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company, the gas supply situation in the city is becoming alarming. The consumption of gas does not decrease even in hot weather. According to statistics at the end of June this year, the average daily consumption is 3.81 million cubic feet, an increase of 0.311% compared to the 3.798 million cubic feet consumed daily in mid-February. Compared to the 3.05 million cubic feet consumed daily in June 1941, this represents an increase of 25%. Mr. Spielkins believes that this phenomenon is unacceptable. The company's current production is at its maximum limit and is approaching a dangerous state. Mr. Spielkins also stated that gas is currently the cheapest fuel in Shanghai. Because the price is too low, the quality is no longer as pure and effective as it was before the war. The raw materials for gas originally came from India, Canada, the United States, and North China. However, due to the development of local industries in India and the high demand for coal, and the labor strikes in the United States, the Shanghai stock of materials is low. However, the company is making every effort to facilitate the shipping of coal to Shanghai. In addition, there are plans to establish a new plant. Most importantly, it is hoped that the citizens will cooperate and reduce consumption as much as possible to overcome this difficult time together.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Nanjing] The preparatory meeting of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in February this year resolved to establish a "United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Movement Month" to promote friendship among the United Nations, understand the recent progress of each United Nation in education and culture, and the development of science and art, to achieve the effect of observation and learning, and to provide a reference for the United Nations organization in its work. The English name of the "United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization" is United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural ORganization. This term is very long, so the first letter of each word is taken to form a new word, Unesco. The English name for the movement month of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is Unesco Month, and the work scheduled to be held from October 28 to the end of December this year includes: (1) Lectures and performances, (2) Exhibitions, (3) Publications, etc. The first category refers to general cultural and thematic lectures, as well as performances of music, drama, film, and broadcasting; the second category refers to exhibitions of artistic works from the past ten years and children's paintings, as well as technical inventions, scientific cooperation, educational plans, educational materials, various buildings, parks, zoos, and charts, models, and photographs of all educational work and things related to mutual assistance and cooperation with the United Nations since 1939; the third category refers to publications and explanations, exchanges, and donations. The Secretariat of the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization has sent this decision to all countries. France, Britain, and the United States all attach great importance to this initiative. The United States has organized two committees specifically to handle this matter. Britain and the United States both plan to send famous theater groups and musical ensembles to France to perform. After receiving the news, the Ministry of Education of our country has appointed Tang Jihe (former president of Cheeloo University in Shandong) as the chief of the preparatory committee. When our reporter visited him today, Mr. Tang said that the Ministry of Education has been actively preparing to participate in this event. He is currently collecting the three types of relevant educational, scientific, and cultural products mentioned above to be sent to the meeting for exhibition. The meeting is scheduled to be held in Paris, France in November this year. Our country plans to send five representatives to attend and participate. The selection of personnel will be made at an appropriate time. (One)</p>
