<p>〔本報江陰十五日電〕十四日午，共軍已近泰興南郊，至十五日，泰興情况不明。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十五日電〕戰局重心移轉蘇北，殆已成不可避免之事實。據揚州急電稱揚州泰縣，人心極爲安定，今晨記者訪晤駐揚軍事最高當局表示稱：蘇北共軍不但違背政府停戰侖令，且不斷擴大地區，攻城奪池，企欲達成其所謂「蘇北解放區」之野心，尤以近週以來，共軍大肆調兵遣將，企圖瘋在進攻我揚泰兩地，更屬夢想，我方爲自衛計，共軍如輕易進犯，當予以迎頭痛擊。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江十五日電〕據泰縣急電：距泰縣西十八里塘頭界溝兩地方共軍於十四日一時向該地國軍攻學，另上部共軍向西南方吳家橋附近國軍攻擊，直至十五日晨，仍在激烈戰事中。泰縣城內，機關槍砲聲淸晰可聞，入晚即宣佈特別戒嚴。又揚泰公路上廣福橋被共軍燬壞切斷後，我國軍正力謀解圍搶修中，一般人預料，蘇北三日後，將有重大開展消息。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰十五日電〕靖江共軍二三百人，便衣短槍，在近城馬靜長里正新三鄉蠢動，其步哨己達城西二十三里之三官殿季家市，民衆都被驅至黃橋前綫，無法逃避。</p>
<p>〔中央社無錫十五日電〕共軍對蘇北已發動全面總攻擊，十三日共軍一路二萬攻達泰興城郊，十四日猛攻城垣，守城國軍一團傷亡慘重，十五晨該城南門被突破，迄午泰興城情况不明，駐防該城以北宣家堡之國軍一團，被共軍六個團圍攻，傷亡尤重，該團團長下洛不明，一路約八千人，向塲州以東地區攻擊中。泰縣外圍四週，均有共軍竄至，已陷入被包圍中，一路二萬餘向六合束北西三面攻擊，其勢極猛，圍攻海門共軍續有後續部隊增至，攻擊甚烈城垣已危。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕調處豫鄂邊區衝突，係由馬帥直接處理，惟在武漢之第九小組，因李先念部行動飄忽，尚未與之取得聯繁，故究為之劃定新駐地，抑令其北移，迄今尚無法決定。今日某官方發言人稱：李先念部企圖於豫鄂陝邊區之五當山，建立其根據地。另一發言人稱：李部擬北渡黃河，因隴海綫有國軍重兵堵截，故滬竄於伏汛山五當山間</p>

<h3>社論　鬱悶之望甘霖</h3>
<p>胡適之先生到了南京，本報記者詢以南京「政治空氣」之觀感，這位我國前駐美大使含笑而答曰：「天一直沒有變，悶熱，該下雨了。」這眞十足表現這個以學者身份出任外交官的一種瀟酒超脫的襟懷。南京的確悶熱，氣象學的統計，南京一般的溫度要高過沿海各地三五度，實在是應該下些雨，來調劑一下這仲夏夜的鬱悶。本報記者向胡氏　詢的是他的對於南京「政治空氣」的觀感，旣然提到「空氣」，那在南京的氣溫是相當低的，所以悶熱，所以該下雨了。人們從鬱悶中希望得到一些淸凉，希望下雨，此在自然界中如此，在「政治空氣」中亦然。</p>
<p>自從日寇投降到如今以來，已是盛夏經秋冬以至感夏。中國的人民，特別是中國的工農大衆，經過了八年的長期抗戰，都希望勝利能够給他們帶來以安定，帶來以和平，使他們從八年的長期苦難中解放出來能够得到一個休養生息的機會，然而這一年來，政府是還都了，人民不但未能還鄉，且原在鄉居的忠實人民，反因抗戰勝利而流離失所。今日充斥京滬的蘇北難民，是抗戰勝利後的果實。使他們離鄕背井輾轉於死亡掙扎中的不是日本的「皇軍」，倒是以「解放」自號的中共武裝部隊，「解放」的是什麼？是解除他們所有的些微私產，使他們不能安居，放逐他們到人地生疏的他鄉流浪，流浪，……！八年的長期抗戰贏得了勝利，帶給他們的依舊是流浪。我們的政府，固然應該覺得慚愧，即使是中國的人民對這些流浪者的同胞，亦覺愧對江東父老。這是人民監督政府的不力，致使他們於抗戰勝利後，重遭顚沛流離之厄。然而他們明白使他們逍逢這厄運的不是別的，却是中國共產黨的賜予。中國共產黨要「解放」他們，放逐他們過這流浪顚沛的生活。不要說旁的區城，「蘇北」密邇京滬，在「蘇北」的種種，最明瞭不過的是上海的市民。他們得到各種報道，他們明瞭這幅流亡圖的眞相，他們將希望及信任給予政府，給予我們的偉大的盟邦，及其所派的特使馬歇爾元帥。就是一向與中共表示同情的「民主同盟」，它的許多領袖中的一個，因爲也許生長在江蘇，對於「蘇北」的情形自然比較熟悉，也對於中共在「蘇北」的所爲，表示不滿，而希望他們改變作風。這一年來，從日本投降後的一年來，到底誰在戕害人民的生命，民族的生命，應該是衆所周知的事了。人民希望政府能够解救他們的倒懸，希望盟邦能够了然於中國的實情。他們望了一年，若大旱之望雲霓，然而現在的高空却是陰霾四眾，密雲不雨。胡適之先生說：「悶熱，該下雨了。」實在是該下雨了；可是雨幾時能下，能使人有一種淸凉感呢？</p>
<p>這是在這種情緒下，我們歡迎美國駐華大使的新任命。這新膺大使之任的不是旁人，卻中國的老友司徒雷登先生。司徒先生生長中國，厭倦政治，對於中國有真切的認識；因爲厭倦政治，所以這次他以七十高齡出任大使，實在情非得已。他愛他的祖國，也愛我們的中國。在這樣一個危難的時會，司徒先生不以高齡而膺命出任大使，這實在是我們的希望。我們希望由於司徒雷登的出任大使，能够化干戈爲玉帛。中國人民對於中共雖然有確切的認識，究竟因爲同是中國人民總希望他們能以民族利益爲重，這就是中國在經過了長期抗戰以後，需要安定，需要休養。因之，中共儘管一面商談，一而造成新局勢，提出不合理的苛刻條件，不履行他們的諾言，如林彪及陳毅輩的爽的，但他們卻同情政府的容忍，因爲政府不願動干戈，希望人民能够有一個休養的機會。這是一種綏靖政策，然而毛澤東周恩來之流究竟不是希特勒，人民了解政府的苦衷。中國人民所不解的就是中共之所以取得如目前的地位，實綠我們盟邦的扶助，而中共現在卻在各處發動反宣傳，反盟邦的宣傳。正在這個時候，聯總的首長卻公然致函中共，給予中共的非法政權以一種事實上的（de　facto）承認。中國人民不解這倒底是一種什麽政策。司徒雷登先生的出任大使，給予中國人民以一種新的希望，給予中共以一種新的機會。我們願司徒雷登先生能够使中國人民的這種希望得以滿足。</p>
<p>我們於此卻要率直的指出人民　管能同情政府對共黨所取的綏靖政策，卻不能姑息政府放棄它份內所應爲之事。在政治方面，實施憲政與民更始旣爲政府的一貫政策，則政府的改組以包容國民黨外的人士，國大代表名單的決定以制定國家的根本大法，決不能因中共的拖延而拖延。中共在中國究竟是一個少數黨，我們萬不能因少數而延誤多數。至於吏治的整飭，貪汚的懲處，原爲政府份內應爲之事，不能因政治高空之未曾明朗即一再躭延。人民同情政府對處理政治問題的方針，卻希望在它本份內事上能够有澈底的事實表現來增強他們對於政府的信任。例如上海的糧貸案，偵訊多日，旣有地方法院與軍法審判的爭執，而生要罪犯或則逍遙法外，或則迄未繩以國法，如此因循，豈能取信人民？再則關於民生主義之經濟建設，原經六全大會通過有案，國營事業與民營企業之劃分，界限分明，而今抗戰勝利，國營事業紛起，即至食糖一項，亦有國營省營機構與民爭利，而在國家執政者方面祗認爲與商爭利，否認有與民爭利情事。殊不知商民原爲一體，民即是商，商即是民。上下交征利，則國危矣！我們希望政府趕緊推進它份內所應爲之事，不要再使人民失望。</p>
<p>止戈為武，人民之喁喁望治，正如久旱之望雲霓，希望甘霖早日下降，使在這鬱悶的氣溫下，能够得到一些淸涼。我們希望政府與中共都能以人民利益，民族利益爲重。我們更希望美國新任駐華大使能够完成他崇高的使命。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾鼓勵法國發奮圖強　共同努力復興歐洲　俾領導大陸回復和平自由</h3>
<p>〔路透社法國梅茲城十四日電〕英國戰時首相邱吉爾今日在梅茲市政應之宴會席上發表演說，主張組織統一之歐洲，以防偉大之世界新機構歸於無能。邱氏並強調法國有強盛之必要，其言略謂，法國人民自救之後，必能挽救歐洲，挽救歐洲即係挽救世界。邱吉爾稱，余曾與法國同處四十年之久，法國今處於困難地位中，余仍與其亦步亦趨，此來即欲於同渡黑暗之時期後，再帶給諸君以鼓勵之辭。余信法國必能恢復其光榮的過去，為合理而持久之和平盡相當之力量。數十年來，英法兩國曾共同前進，駢肩奮鬥，卒完成責任，打倒侵略者，願爾我繼續在一起，永不分離。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰法國雖獲光榮勝利，但其創傷至為嚴重，所有血液，幾已完全流盡，吾人當勿忘法國曾為盟方之作戰目的而犧牲二百萬人。二次大戰發生之前，其實祇須禁止德國武裝，即可預防。二次大戰中，余曾負担一部份之任務，余從未允英法之間產生些微裂痕，諸君亦永不可令此籌裂痕發生。歷史已使我兩大民族，結成不可分不可犯之關係，吾人以後不可略有差池，未來事務應由了解歷史意義之人担仕之。邱吉爾　述及來梅茲之原因，謂當北非戰役初期，季勞將軍即與余約定在梅茲相晤，今果達到目的。當戴高樂將軍於一九四四年十一月在巴黎招待本人時，余又向其談及此次約會，渠云必能如願以償，戴將軍及本人從未對法國之偉大表示失望，深信最後勝利必屬於我。</p>
<p>最后邱吉爾表示願一談兩個現實的問題，首先為歐洲問題，邱氏謂：吾人曾兩次吃德國之虧，此番不可再令重演，無統一團結之歐洲，偉大之世界新機構，雖在美國領導之下，仍不免勞而無功。兩次爆炸均源出歐洲，故吾人當首先以歐洲為念。其次乃法國問題，無強大之法國，歐洲即無復興之望，國家之需要強大，未有更甚於今日之法國者。要之，吾人必須加強團結，形成「一下民族」。余謹以忠實老友之資格，向諸君提供忠吿，即民族必須統一，俾領導歐洲回復和平與自由。法國如能自救！必能挽救歐洲，挽救歐洲即所以挽救世界。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕白宮發言人稱；杜魯門總統可望於星期一簽署三十七億五千萬元之英美借款協定。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十四日專電〕此間對於國會通過對英貸款案之反應，一般均着眼於英美貿易之利益，以及其對於來日世界經濟合作之影響。然美國亦有若干觀察家，強調美國此種行動，包含重大政治意義。彼等坦率指稱，英美成立財政協定後，莫斯科在經濟上，現將與非蘇維埃國家聯合陣綫，立於敵對地位。此等觀察家復稱，蘇聯在聯合國會議及巴黎四外長會議中之「交戰國」策略，使許多國會議員及其選民深信，今日世界正處於兩種思想鬥爭之中，而投票反對對英貸款者，等於捨棄英民主之原則，此乃贊成貸款案者獲勝理由也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十五日電：美蘇在歐洲方面之關係，今日有重要之發展，發展結果，可促使美國改變其對蘇之基本政策。最重要之發展，厥為美國賠償專員鮑萊之聲明。鮑氏最近曾至德奧視察，據稱，蘇聯擅自德國搬走各項物資，顯係違反波茨坦協定，眾信蘇方如繼續違反波茨坦協定，堅持無理賠償要求，則美國有改變其對蘇聯基本政策之可能。另一重要事件，即為前告失蹤之美軍四人，其中二人證明已為蘇　所捕，蘇方聲明此二人之被「若干蘇聯軍官」為美方逮捕之故，此點可證明蘇美兩方在歐洲交惡之程度。另一事件，為蘇聯海軍勒亭因企圖獲取原子秘密而在西雅圖受審，辯論終結，勒亭有被檐決之可能。</p>

<h3>八一三舉行成立會　九月九日開大會　臨參會七月底結束　吳市長邀市參議員商討會前準備事項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長昨假新生活俱樂部執行本市第一屆參議員，商討參議會成立前各項準備事項，到參議員一六一人，首由吳樂致歡迎詞，略謂：上海為我國第一大都市，上海參議會應作全國參議會之模範，不論有何意見，均盼「開誠布公」切實合作，市府決誠意接受各位建議，同時以本身困難訴諸各位，並能允許予吾等若乾時間以改善，如能維持此種精神，則「府會一家」，必能達成。今日召集茶會之宗旨：　中央規定參議會成立會由市府召集，現特先舉行茶會，由各位共同決定召開日期，　會議地址問題，參議會為一市之最高會議，將來應覓得一適宜會址，目前亦徵求眾意。</p>
<p>正副議長致詞</p>
<p>繼由臨參會議長徐奇　致詞，讚揚市長過去與漢口及重慶參議員之合作精神，同時報告臨參會應於七月底休會結束，提議八月一日成立新參議會。地點則提議仍在南昌路臨參會會址，或中正中路福明邨。後由副議長奚玉書提議大西路前德國學校，現住美軍百餘人，如能設法解決渠等住處，即可用作會場，大會成立宜愈早愈好。並謂以市長過去經騐及作風，尊重參議員意見，將來正式大會成立後，以「府會一家」，「開誠布公」作口號，成績必能圓滿</p>
<p>紛紛發表意見</p>
<p>旋由參議員翟　發表意見，認為開會前應有充分準備，會期寗可稍後。市府財政預算，須及早編製，並宜提高，以解除公務員生活重擔。鍾可託主張八月一日先舉行成立大會，會議不妨稍遲舉行。顧竹軒主張由市長決定日期，毋庸再討論。市長繼即聲稱：自接任以來，十之七八時間均化於臨時發生之問題，市政均被耽擱，編製及確立預算現決在七月底左右完成。市府負執行之責參議員負立法之責，如市參議會成功，立即可使外邦覺得中國政治上軌道。在國外，春秋兩季開會最多，夏季過熱，精神疲倦，易於草率從事，故本人意見，於「八一三」為成立大會，選舉議長副議長，九月一日開第一屆大會，市府報告及預算屆時均可提出。會址有三處可能性，即南昌路臨參會會址，前德國學校，及前日僑自治會等，但此皆實際問題，故主張授權與參議會秘書處籌備。馮有俱以九月一日將舉行盛大新聞記者節，並將追悼死難記者，故對新聞界議員殊為不便，要求延期。最後由潘公展建議九月九日召開大會，以紀念勝利受降。結果一致通過。散會後新聞界參議員潘公展，趙君豪，史詠　，馮有俱，唐世昌與市長等十餘人，特合攝一影留念。</p>

<h3>市民聲請　更改姓名</h3>
<p>市府釋示疑義三點</p>
<p>市政府前據第二十九區區公所呈稱：査邇來本區各保住民聲請更名者甚多，或謂調査時爲家人誤報，或謂於淪陷時使用原各，近以參加公職競選，蓋因戶籍所載姓名；或與資歷證件姓名逈異，或與日常用名不同，紛紛請求改更前來，查姓名之使用，國府曾於三十年七月頒佈「姓名使用限制條例，」該條例第一條原有「凡中華民國人民之本名，以一個爲限，登記戶籍上之姓名爲本名，使用姓名或別號者，應表明其本名」之規定。是項參加競選者，可否依上項規定，使用別名，另表明其本名，此應請示者一。</p>
<p>一再是項申請更改姓名，可否以「調査錯誤」諭，將戶口調査册改正，抑依照內政部二十二年六月八日頒布之「更名改姓及冠姓規則」之規定手續辦理，此應請示者。</p>
<p>二又是項更名經核均不適用「更名改姓及冠姓規則」第二條各款，是否應辦更名手續，此應請示者三。以上三項，懇祈分別賜予釋示。當經市府釋示如下：</p>
<h3>人民以使用本名為原則</h3>
<p>（一）人民使用名字，以使用本名爲原則，姓名使用限制條例第一條第三項使用別號，表明其本名，僅爲例外之規定。公職當選人，其姓名自須與其所具資格證件所載姓名相符，且須與戶籍册上之姓名相符，（參照內政部二十一年四月十七日渝民字第二一五〇號訓令。）是戶籍册上之姓名，須與其所具資格蹬件所載姓名相符，如某甲以別號當選，雖表明其本名，亦難生效。</p>
<h3>更名姓與更正登記有別</h3>
<p>（二）內政部審核更名改姓及冠姓規則所指之更名，係指當事人對本身現在使用之名字，有規則第二條所列各種情形之一，請求更改另一新創名字而言，並非如戶籍法所規定之更正登記，僅係當事人對戶籍册上之姓名，認爲塡載錯誤，請求更正。故前項聲更正名字，毋庸依照內政部審核更名改姓及冠姓規則之規定手續辦理，僅需由當事人申叙事實，附具證明文件，呈請該管區公所更正之。惟爲愼重起見，區公所應經實地調査或審核其所附證件後核定。除在存區戶口調查冊更正外，並須轉知該管警察分局，保辦公處，一面呈報本府</p>
<p>（三）區公所如遇上述二項情形以外之請求更名案件，無法決定，或對聲請人所附證件發生疑義時，應隨時呈請本府核示云。</p>

<p>昨日紗市頗爲挺秀，粵帮進胃復暢漢帮亦來　　，京蕪來客對中小型紗亦有相當採辦，是以廿支各牌俱有向榮之況，　馬漲起最多，較上週末高六七萬，其餘約升二三萬元，脚地異常堅硬，細紗及綫無甚榮辱，去化仍滯，午時紡建公司照例開紗，價較上期標低一萬至六萬，另有粗細紗綫九種，分兩組用投標方式標售。</p>
<p>花銷甚暢　本埠現棉交易頗旺，市價依然堅挺，計申新第一廠進烏拉圭二百包，德豐廠進彭家坡五百包，大生進彭家坡二百包，此外花號亦有五六百包交易，價大一二千元。</p>
<p>棉布平疲　棉布實需岑寂，僅四川廣東漢口杭州等處，對於細布嗶嘰稍有需要，其他銷路均不暢。</p>
<h3>中紡目前產量</h3>
<p>每日產紗九百餘件　棉布日產二萬餘疋</p>
<p>傳中紡公司，因電力限制，產量銳减一節，據該公司業務處談，中紡公司整個增產計劃，正逐步推進中，除國內市塲外，並擬拓展至南洋羣島一帶，此次生產量減少，係電力供應問題，因電力公司若干鍋爐，發生毁損，故發電量稍有限制，據電力公司消息，該公司向美訂購能發電二萬四千瓩之發電機，短期內即可運到，閘北水電公司，自下月起發電量亦可望增加八千瓩，故届時電力供應問題，必可迎刃而解，至中紡公司目前之產量，據該負責人吿稱，現每日產紗數量爲九百餘件，棉布約爲二萬餘疋。</p>
<h3>金市平和美鈔續跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開微升，人心尚好，銀樓帮微補，高價見一九七萬，美鈔經套賣而復鬆，金市漲勢遂暫吿泯止，十時後中央配出八十五條，價一九五萬七五，入後更趨平和，近午仍在一九五萬迄一九六萬徘徊，午後續被美鈔帶小至一九四萬五左右，結果較前收回挫一萬七，飾金念萬零八，紋銀一千八，銀元一三八〇元有賣，暗拆銀根仍鬆，息價一角半至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔因美衆院對英美借款業已通過，買戶趨往港幣活動，供方見股，自晨開二五六〇元賣價起，節節下游，午刻已破入二五〇〇元大關，午後繼續下游，結果較上週六再跌七十元，對英滙兌軋升至三元七角有零，對黃金套頭亦拔開至七八四元對十兩，港票仍有進展，見五八〇元高價，而後稍回，結果再升五元，港滙五六〇元有成交，印滙六九〇元，英滙九千二，均有賣，美滙仍平。</p>
<h3>消費合作社　自辦食米配售</h3>
<p>每石便宜萬餘元</p>
<p>上海市消費合作社理事主席李萬鍾氏，最近經社會局發給採辦證，派員分赴各產米區大量購運，不日到滬，凡該社社員，不論入社先後，每一家庭單位，至少均可配得一石，依照實費計算，每石比滬市評價便宜一萬餘元，聞該社並直接受學校工廠團體及各合作社委託，集團採辦，爲市民服務。</p>
<h3>定價漲至三角半　美棉定貨無多</h3>
<p>頃據棉業權威方面稱：自美政府撤銷物品限價後，美棉價格已上漲，以前定貨每磅約美金三角左右，目前須三角五分，椎近數月來同業間向美定購美棉已較前鬆弛，原因係美棉借款三千三百萬美金已無多餘額，加以本市各同業及各紗廠據估計美棉存貨已可應付至翌年二月，至最近所到美棉，皆爲以前定貨。</p>
<h3>堆棧婪索棉業反對</h3>
<p>棉業公會茲以洋商堆棧屢有不合理之需索，且棧租亦不時增加，例如美棉一包，照目前棧租係美金一元一角，雖係按月計算，但在中途亦有增加可能，至提貨時，啓門翻貨等均須納費，若所提美棉適在下層，則上層所疊美棉勢非先翻下不可，聞每包納費二千，據棉業界人士稱，是項無謂損失，實難忍受，故該會現正集議向洋商堆棧交涉。</p>
<h3>茶葉公司拖吸珍眉　寧州花香存底告罄</h3>
<p>專銷海外之珍眉綠茶，各茶葉公司對於陳貨頻來問津，刻下已有相當拖進，待機出口，至於內銷花色，連日宜興一帶暢銷寗州花香，買氣頗盛，惟存底將罄，致父易未能做開，其他各茶，本街店莊銷路尚不惡，其中尤以台灣紅茶及新紹炒爲最，但價格並未見升進。</p>
<h3>木材穩定</h3>
<p>昨木材市况，杉木價平穩，因銷路及到貨尚相埓，洋松到貨雖有，惟近日來洋行方面定貨减少，故貨價不易回下，柳安聞有到貨，價略回軟。</p>
<h3>國藥好轉</h3>
<p>國藥交易，淸閒已久，近有廣幣大量動辦，吸胃不澥，更且台灣帮續來垂靑，猶見生色不少，故各貨大都好轉，惟山貨最呈堅俏。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕華爾街公報載稱，參院於星期六，以五十四票對二十五票，否決銀價定爲每盎斯七一·一一元之議案。僉信，參院可能與衆院謀取妥協，而通過參院所建議之每盎斯九〇·五元，衆院方面初聞參院將其議案否決，甚表驚異，不願妥協。但因多數黨及少數黨諸領袖俱有意妥協，故此事或可成功。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國財政部所有白銀，幾達二二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇斯，遠盎超過貨幣準備所需要者，但美國工業界仍感白銀之缺乏，其原因，由於美國法律規定，財政部不得將白銀售與工業界也，西部產銀諸州之參衆兩院議員，刻正要求財部將白銀價格規定爲每盎斯九〇·三分，至兩年後，則提高至每盎斯一·二九元，按目前銀價爲每盎斯七一·二分。</p>
<h3>美國缺乏純銻　倫敦價格較高</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十五日電〕此間貿易界人士，認爲目前美國之銻價每磅一五，八分，即將急速上漲，據稱，美國於銻砂甚為需要，而輪入則不甚踴躍，因倫敦銻價達每噸一二五鎊，（約合每磅美金二十三分，）遠較美國市價爲高也，據官方統計，美國於一九四五年中需銻達二四，〇〇〇噸，而國內所能供給者不過百分之十，中國官方報吿，中國國內銻礦儲藏，達二，五〇〇，〇〇〇噸</p>

<h3>沈鎮南氏談　蔗糖會議經過</h3>
<p>台糖公司總經理沈鎮南月前赴台，出席全蔗糖事業會議，據稱：該會決定之重要事件，首推「分糖法」，在昔日本時代，製糖會社規定原料價格，獲得總督府核准後，即依此向蔗農收購，此種辦法，在目前物價尚未臻穩定時，已不適用，故不得不採用新辦法，其原則即糖公司與蔗農雙方合作，其取值比例，公司得產糖量百分之五十二，蔗農得百分之四十八，並由長官公署組設糖價審核委員會，以出席蔗糖會議各單位中選出十三人担任委員，以每年十二月至次年四月間，按月糖價爲標準，每月舉行評價會議一次，公司向蔗農收買甘蔗，即以此計算，此法已由陳長官核准公佈實施，次爲擴展種蔗面積，可能在七月至九月間，推廣九甲之多，（每甲計十六畝）預算後年可能有卅萬噸食糖產量，沈氏繼述該會並定協助蔗農方案兩種，（一）辦理蔗農貸款，因農民購買蔗苗耕地種植，在在須款爲數甚鉅，擬向台灣銀行舉辦貸款，（二）施種肥料，約需硫酸亞五萬噸，一時不易購辦，決議儘先購買各種肥料如荳餅花生餅等，以資替代。</p>

<h3>搶救蘇北難民　　抗戰八年猶可熬　鬥爭一日實難挨</h3>
<p>— 特約記者和香林</p>
<p>本報二日掦州訊</p>
<p>蘇北是江蘇的一環，更是中國有力的一環，這裏有一千八百萬的人口，廣大肥沃的農村，以及大量的生產，可是自「八一五」日本投降了以後，除了揚州，泰州，南通，徐海以外，大都被共產黨相繼的攻陷。他們不顧國族民命，實行三資鬥爭，三光政策，鬥爭的鬥光了爲止，殘殺的被殘殺了，靑年的壯丁，編爲他們的民兵，十個月以來，蘇北淪陷的民衆男女老幼，因不堪壓迫，無以生存，均相率的流亡，相率的拋葉了可愛的家園，流離到揚州及江南的京滬沿綫，不但是嗷嗷待哺，而且是餐風宿露，過着非人的生活。我曾聽見過許多難民這樣的感慨說：「抗戰八年較好過，鬥爭一日實難挨」。這種悲痛的呼聲，我們焉得不表示同情而加以拯救呢？</p>
<p>救濟工作日夜忙碌</p>
<p>這種慘絕人寰的流離失所，已經引起了我們中央當局極大的關懷，在上月國民政府特派社會部谷部長主持蘇北難民救濟專責，並在鎭江成立了一個蘇北難民救濟會議。經過了谷部長和王主席多日的策劃，在這個有權的機構之下，就分設了揚州，泰縣，南通，徐州，海州五地辦事處，各担任一方面的救濟工作。</p>
<p>揚州辦事處是在六月二十日正式組織成立的，據該處主任謝植綱談組織狀况，副主任張希級，是揚州社會救濟中心站站長，還有一個是李味三，是蘇寗分署揚州工作隊隊長，他們兩個是派來兼任副主任，協助工作的，社會部派來的人只有兩個，一個是黃德鳴，一個是范鵬，都担任督導工作，另外就當地的機關裏調來文書會計事務等工作人員三人，都是不支薪而工作的，看他們這少少的幾個人，居然能担當這樣重大的事件，是值得敬佩的，他們的工作在謝主任領導下，提出了八個字的口號，就是「星期無假，辦公無時」，在這口號之下，弄得大家日夜開工，眞是除了吃飯睡覺之外，無一個時候不在辦公桌上，因此他們的工作效率比較一般進步迅速，同時他們在辦事處組織之外，還定了一個舉行救濟工作聯合會報辦法，約集當地有關機關首長及從事救濟工作的人，參加會報，每個星期日舉行一次，報吿工作情形，加以檢討及推進，因此在救濟工作上減少了若干困難，另外還成立了一個監察委員會，推選當地的駐軍長官黃師長百韜爲王任委員，林專員爲副主任委員，其他委員則爲社會賢達及有關機關首長，這樣把監察權超於辦事處執行權之外，更表示它的公開態度，因此更博得多數人的同情，這也是對救濟工作上一個極大有力的帮助。</p>
<p>「解放」後無衣無食</p>
<p>揚州的難民情形怎樣呢，讓我來作一個詳細的報吿，自從共產黨在蘇北實行「解放」起，把蘇北的人民「解放得無衣無食無住」，拖兒帶女的流亡來到揚州，這其中的人，包括高郵，寶應，興化，鹽城，泰縣，淮陰，阜寗，淮安，宿遷，漣水，泗陽各縣，及江都附廓各區的人，難民的總數，經過了三次的登記，第一次登記是去年十二月舉行的，只有八三五七人，第二次是今年三月裏登記的，又加了八二一一人，第三次是最近舉辦的。數字達三一五九九人，三　登記的數字合計起來，一共是四萬八千一百六十七人，這些人通通　集揚州城內，嗷嗷待哺，　絲的流亡縣政府及六七兩區專　公署，都在揚州設有辦事處，各縣縣長縣黨部書記長，靑年團書記等，都很熱心的，分別約集各縣流亡揚州人士成立善後救濟協會，來負責辦理難民登記調査事宜。還有各縣的客籍人士，則成立同鄕會主持其事，像這種救濟團體在揚一共有二十三個之多，這二十三個救濟單位，因鑒於難民尚有露宿無歸，而急待收容者，乃發起成立招待所，在城內的空房或廟宇內，總共成立了十九個招待所，最近又添一個，已有二十個了，招待所內難民的總數字，為二千七百三十人，住所難民，有大學畢業生，有律師，有中小學敎員，都是席地而臥，一身之外無長物，慘痛萬分，不可名狀，當谷部長與王主席視察難民招待所的時候，他們都喊「我們的救星來了」，一個個含着一眶熱淚，向谷部長及王主席下拜，假若他們還有一綫希望的話，誰肯這樣的哀求，這是誰給予他們的呢？「暴民政治者的共軍」！</p>
<p>收容靑年安撫流亡</p>
<p>再看看流亡的靑年與學生怎樣？流亡揚州的靑年不在少數，現已有青年團主持設置靑年招待所四所，共收容靑年八百餘人，已經登記尚未入所者有一千五百餘人，另外還有敎育部成立的流亡學生進修班，也收容了學生四百一十人，靑年招待所的經費，是由王主席特發的，目前尚可維持，將來如政府不予設法，實有難乎爲繼之可能，一般靑年，除了上課出操外，還協助調査及登記難民工作，這是多麼可愛呀。</p>
<p>發放急賑擬定標準</p>
<p>據謝主任說：「救災如救火」，果然他們的工作，也如火如荼的，本來揚州分配的賑款是一億元，在蘇北難民救濟會議決定，是拿來辦救濟事業的，谷部長王主席視察後，認爲有放急賑之必要，臨時改變提出一部份賑款，發放急賑，現在揚州辦事處，已擬定發放標準（一）年在六十歲以上之老人，（二）未滿一歲之嬰孩及其產母，（三）現在病中不能謀生者，（四）身體殘廢不能謀生者，（五）有未成年之子女二人以上因而不能謀生之主婦，（六）十四歲以上未出閣女子而不能操勞作及自力謀生者。（七）現役軍人家屬及抗戰陣亡的遺族流亡無依持有證明文件者。（八）將產之孕婦不能工作者。（九）十二歲以下之赤貧兒。</p>
<p>迅速登記，現在二十三單位中，已有十餘單位將名册送到，一俟　齊經抽査後，即可發放。普賬名册，係由保長造送，有流亡靑年二百五十餘人，協助辦理二日即可完成，眞是特別快，爲使難民眞正求得實惠，尙須分別調查，預計揚州共二百六十四保，如多派人員出動，一週內或可完成。還有一些難民，是住在許多親戚朋友們處，因爲報吿戶口時沒有報明是難民流亡字樣，於是個人有向該處申請登記，現該處爲彌補這種缺憾起見派員會同縣政府複査戶口時詳爲詢問中。</p>
<p>招待難民改善辦法</p>
<p>關於難民招待所之改善辦法，揚州辦事處現已擬定：其大要爲不能蔽風雨之房舍加以修葺，無蘆蓆者發給蘆蓆，並設置公共水缸，舉行飲水消毒。每一招待所有隔離病房一間，並按人數多少設置浴盆一具或兩具，現正分頭編造預算估價辦理中。又環境衛生方面，亦積極辦理，衛生署的技正劉泳，正分別去洒佈DDT藥粉，難民在此情形之下，內心頗為安慰。還有江蘇農行舉辦之小本借貸，亦積極舉辦。據揚州辦事處第一次聯合會報上農行經理報告：一天之中已有廿七戶，此數字雖則太少，但因一般難民，尙不明瞭借貸情形，正由辦事處加緊宣傳，這是他們救濟工作開展後的鳥瞰，也就是在短短的十天以內，他們的表現，在這裏我們想引用兩句話，王主席對難民說：「共軍要你們不安，我要你們安，共軍叫你們沒飯吃，我要你們都有飯吃，」這上面所說的，也就是「安民之道」。</p>
<p>駐軍義俠節食一天</p>
<p>在揚州的救濟工作，除了政府舉辦的而外還有駐軍黃師長百韜，也發動該師全體官兵節食一日，發放急賑，每戶大口發給一千八百元，小口九百元，並發米大口三斤半，小口二斤。受賑的人數達四千八百人，都是極貧而需要急賑的，至今他們還在歌頌黃將軍的恩德，最幸運的　水的難胞，他們還得了顧祝同將軍特發的麵粉。</p>
<p>看來難民是沒有問題了，但出人意外的，還不斷的有問題發生，在江都縣的八九兩區地方人民，因被共軍的壓迫與殘害，紛紛逃集江都縣附郭司徒廟鳳凰橋一帶，約有三四千人，內中有縣參議員有中學敎員，律師及外籍傳敎士等，揚州辦事處得訊後，即會同地方機關，派人前往搶救，那知到了鳳凰橋，只看見有數百人之多，因爲共軍見多數人民離開他們的一解放區」，就四佈謠言，說政府登記難民，這樣的寬仁厚澤，並不是好意，是想拿難民來編成壯丁隊的，在這種謠言攻勢之下，逃出來的難民，又四散的逃走了，痛心得很！不知道這些難胞，今後過着如何苦痛的生活呢？我們關心！我們同情！我們懷念……！</p>

<h3>法華鎮應速設醫院</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人居住滬西法華　住戶多苦人，近來霍亂病很多，今天走在鎭上，從西到東，看見離開十數家門戶，就有稻草灰及石灰圈，這分明是死了人的記號。在下午，鄰家又有患霍亂者數人。他們沒有受過敎育，因此請了挑痧者挑痧，豈不誤事？前數年，本鎮每到夏季。地方慈善機關來此分設免費醫院，加惠貧民不少。在此疫癘日增，最好仍請衛生當局設立臨時慈善醫院一所，實爲公衆安寗所必要。（居民勤上）</p>

<h3>音樂的抽象性</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>音樂為無形無影的藝術，有著不可捉摸的抽象性。但許多人每聽一個曲子，總喜歡問「這裡面是什麼意思？」這問題如果遇到了詩人，文學家，也許會把答案撒謊得異常美麗。但是如果遇到真正懂音樂的人，他對於這問題就難於答復了。悲多芬奏鋼琴時，常有朋友問他：「這是什麼意思？」悲多芬肯定的說：「就是這個意思！」——這是最忠實的答復。</p>
<p>當然，把音樂概念化，是人們的理性要求；把富麗的曲調寄託於富麗的詩詞，把偉大的詩歌，配以偉大的旋律與和聲，都是未可厚非的。但是藝術，多少有些「超脫性」及不可思議性；如果勉強把它弄得太現實了，又顯得極其俗氣。比如，雞叫的聲音，狗吠的聲音，如果都利用樂器，把它逼真地描寫出來，真覺得俗不可耐。如果雞狗的叫聲也在管弦樂隊里叫出來，那麼你演口技好了，何必弄音樂？不久以前，有一家口琴隊在南京演奏，節目之一是「描寫音樂」的曲子，里面雞鳴的聲音，就是用口技做的，結果博得滿場笑聲，音樂氣氛完全打破，所以「描寫音樂」，實近遊戲，為正統音樂家所不取。有人說得好：「最高級的藝術，應當用最經濟的材料最暗示的方法，來表達一種不可思議的事情」。這，我以為也可以拿繪畫來比喻！繪畫繪得過於逼真過於現實的時候，往往會令人想到：其實你用照相機拍照好了，何必苦苦地來畫？（我不懂美術，這比喻不知對否）。</p>
<p>「花非花，霧非霧，夜半來，天明去；來如春夢不多時，去似朝雲無覓處！」這著白居易的詩，曾經黃自先生用D長調譜過曲，商務館那本「音樂」，曾採為教材，學生們唱了，往往會問：「先生這個到底是什麼意思？」那麼做先生的，也只好抄襲悲多芬一下，答曰：「就是這個意思。」——這例子，也可以幫助說明音樂的抽象性。</p>
<p>音樂，只能，用情感來承受，把它渲染得太現實，就顯得太勉強而俗氣。</p>
<h3>看畫思鄉</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>廣西是我的家鄉，自逃難出來後，已經三年了沒有回去，我無時不在惦念著，勝利後的刧餘鄉土，和受磨折的質樸辛勤善良的鄉民。但是這幾年來，從家書和鄉友們的來信裏，我仍然無法清楚故鄉的情形，因為他們的來信，常常是帶著一些安慰的淡寫，將凄慘的破壞，悲痛的災害，輕輕地說過去，像安慰著一個孩子般，不要悲哀既失的，須努力於將來的重建似的。</p>
<p>昨天，去看了司徒喬先生災情寫生畫展，我像回到故鄉去走了一趟，親自目睹瓦礫頹牆的家，和飢饉暴屍的人民。</p>
<p>桂林，梧州，柳州，維容，陽朔，全州，這些地方，我都走過，有很深的記憶留在我的腦子裏。我親看著灕江的中正大橋，和維容橋的建築，曾與那些打椿的工人攀談過，這些幾乎是用人民的血肉所構筑起來的工程，現在眼看著的已經骨碎肢離了。</p>
<p>畫中的難民，飢民，逃荒者，父女，船娘，和老漢，我都熟悉他們，就如遇見了自己的家人一樣。年老的人，生命活力已叫他們竭下晚年的勞作了，可是他們沒有休息，也永不會想得到休息，除了死神收斂了他們的活力。年輕的兒女，小小的心靈裏便負擔著四五十歲老人的憂慮，要為家庭生計而擔愁。這些是我們故鄉習以為常的事情，但是當我看畫時，默對著一張「父女」圖很久，我不能壓制辛酸的淚，潛然流下來了；他們就像我的家人，我同情憐憫他們，我不忍看見他們被重重的災難壓迫已經逼成發白癡鈍的眼睛，人是不應該有這樣的神態和迫害呵！</p>
<p>漓江春晴，陽朔畫山，陽朔雨　，和初春煙雨渡花橋，這裏畫中的境界，是我以前留連的地方。在漓水江畔，看天上下著毛毛細雨的江景，若是在晴明的春天，連綿不高的小山，像烏里怪狀的動物背脊，遙遙的伏在雨峯，山上披著一條條滿凝水氣的白雲，這些景象，只要站在中正大橋上，便可以飽賞了；城區對岸的花橋，七星岩，月牙山……在今日畫人的筆下，已成了　水殘山！司徒喬先生在題初春煙雨渡花橋上說，未能盡緻也。司徒喬先生為著使災情給人民永遠留下不忘的記憶與教訓，他自然不能像別的畫家，悠閒地去作「寫意」的工夫，他的筆是沾著眼淚的。今天，縱算有些「錦繡山河無恙在」的地方，然而，那是帶著凄涼慘　的顏色呵！</p>
<p>重建中之梧州，炸燬與重建，這是畫家透過了痛苦的筆，給家鄉報告了一些再生的消息，不過在眼前的混亂情形裏，這些微弱的新生力量，是應該給予更大的援助，不然的話，只像是「　　補茅屋」那樣，人民得到的實惠，又有幾許呢？</p>
<p>看畫思鄉，這種情感是無邊無際酸味，象司徒喬先生夫人伊湄題船娘的歌曰：「晴搖月，雨搖風，晝搖愁，夜搖夢，搖不掉飢寒，搖不脫貧窮，米價苦昂捐苦重！」製上來的一縷鄉愁，就如一支船櫓一般，不停的搖著搖著，我懷疑，什麼時候才稍可安靜？</p>
<p>我將走出展覽室，回頭再望望那張畫著「放下你的鞭子」的油畫，看見那個鳳陽姑娘，她流下的淚珠在滾動了，想想自己原也是唱「鳳陽鼓」的人，寒顫抖擻，反過身便匆匆走下樓了。</p>
<p>在回來的街上，我想著　民圖裏最末的一張，那個躺著的殘廢老人說得好，他望著那七八個躑在地下的兒孫說：「我們苦了，也算了，不過我們不應該再讓這羣國家未來的主人翁再要苦一輩子下去！」這是沉痛的話也是說出我思鄉心裏最後要說的話。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　八六</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>麗華好了之後，立刻要離開徐州，加之戰爭已在向徐州蔓延，張弦也造成再往南走。但是為了必須湊一筆路費起見，張弦請求麗華再唱三天臨別紀念戲。麗華不肯，急得張弦幾乎向他磕頭，結果麗華只好又唱了三天。</p>
<p>第二步，麗華又流浪到了開封。這次麗華事先向墨太太聲明：除了唱戲以外，絕不應酬。墨太太出於上次在徐州受的教訓，也不願再勉強麗華了。一切人事關係，都改為張弦一個人應付。開封的地主人情有著北京的嚴肅；正氣；而且比較撲素；淳厚。因此他們不久便安定下來了。</p>
<p>在開封，麗華的心情，非常的甯靜；她又能夠繼續地看書，　　地過她自己的生活了。她對於這個新環境，很快地就習慣了，她相當地喜歡這座樸素的古城。她住在城北的黃大王廟門街，距黃大王廟僅咫尺之近。黃大王廟裏面現在是一所私立女子中學校。這引起了麗華濃厚的興趣，她每天看見黃昏時候，一羣羣女學生從裏面三五結隊地挾著書包走出來，談笑風生，令她不勝羨慕之至！她常常想：要是她也能和這羣女孩子在一起；要是她也能每天到這所學校裏面去讀書，天哪！那她該是多麼快活呵！她把這羣女學生看作天之驕子；看作才是高高在上；又紅又亮的星星！</p>
<p>麗華因為太景仰那所女學校了，她便不斷帶著麗雲在學生們上課的時間，混了進去，躲在一間教室外面的窗子底下，偷聽著裏面的講授。麗雲不耐煩，便溜到一邊去玩她自己的了。這裏的運動場，成為了她最感興趣的地方。學生們一下課，麗華趕快又和麗雲走出去。後來她不但偷聽，而且還拿著小本子去偷記。從這裏，她得到不少的新知識。</p>

<h3>查辦　（小說）</h3>
<p>— 成甫</p>
<p>不知是從什麼時候起，人家都不喚姚老頭子為「老頭子」，而卻都稱他「姚大人」了。這空間是人家在敬重他，還是在輕蔑他，姚老頭子自己也弄不大明白；不過據他自己告訴別人，依照這次他在這縣城里榮任了鹽務管局第三分處主任的一件事來說，人家喚他「姚大人」是完全對他表示十二分敬重的意思，并且據他推測，這稱呼，還多少帶點對他拍馬的成分的。所以，姚老頭子就非常得意，當他每次在遇見舊時教育界的老同事的時候，他總會不期然的這樣說：</p>
<p>「朋友們稱我姚大人真不敢當，不過，弄鹽務這門公事飯，原是我十幾年前頭吃過的，過去吃教書飯原是我沒辦法時弄的，呃，說起吃教書飯，的確清苦，既吃不飽，又餓不死，我姚老頭子總算也嚐過幾年……呃，現在總算擺脫了，弄鹽務了……這次麼，我得好好幹他一番，總之，呃，我姚老頭子不要錢，這就不怕辦不好，我遲早總得幹點給你們看看……」</p>
<p>姚老頭子對老朋友方面，的確是夠交情的，譬如說：教育界有兩個素來比較和他湊頭得攏的同事，他就很夠幫忙的提拔他們，在他的辦事處裏安排了職位，一個任了秘書，一個任了稽查主任。</p>
<p>「自己老朋友不用用誰呢？」姚老頭子時常擺出十二分正經的對一班給他喚來的朋友說：「不過吃這門公事飯麼，說不難，實在很難，說難，實在倒不難。從前我弄了六七年，弄來弄去是一個科員，所以鈔票也多不起來，唔，這是我自己不要錢！一個人要清高，齷齪銅鈿不要賺，我就愛這樣做。象一般死要錢的傢伙，專門運私貨，一多了幾個銅鈿，就去孝敬上司，對上司提拔他，所以他們總會高升；然而這樣即使升了局長，又幹麼？多醜！像我就是實硬的，一直辦清公事……到現在，雖然兩袖清風，但畢竟也弄到個主任了，呃，不是我誇口，我姚老頭子這個主任位兒，是過去老上司來聘請我的，因為他知道我姚老頭子不要錢，辦清公事……」</p>
<p>姚老頭子究竟有沒有像他口中所說的那樣辦清公事，這隻有他自己曉得，不過自從他當了一些時的主任以後，他的生活漸漸闊起來了卻是事實，就說住的吧；他已從一間低陋的平房，搬住到一所很壯觀的巨宅里去。穿著一方面；也自舊得不很體面的布長衫，而變為簇新的毛貨。至於行的；則已自備著一輛包車在代步了，外加家里還遷雇用了個把娘姨。自然囉，姚老頭子的生活一時變得這樣富庶起來，人家當然也都看見，並且也多少能對他捉摸得到幾分。不過姚老頭子一在碰見朋友或熟人時，他總會很乖的謅上這麼幾句：</p>
<p>「弄鹽務相當苦，經費沒經費，房子沒房子，最近總算局裡接收一幢房子下來，我落得暫時借來住住，不過離辦公處路太遠，於是托人借了這麼一輛舊車子來，聊以代代步，總之，都是公家的，我們吃公事飯的人，一切都得「公」……總之，呃，我姚老頭子不要錢，辦清公事，實硬，怕誰？」</p>
<p>姚老頭子的確不怕誰，他自己也覺得不用怕誰；憑自己這套老經騐，老手腕，幹他下去，鬼不知，人不覺，還怕誰？……</p>
<p>一天，一天過去，姚老頭子也一天，一天幹下去……</p>
<p>不幾時，事情畢竟出亂子來了；報上就有這麼一段記載：</p>
<p>「本縣警局，昨得密報，於港口抄獲大批私鹽，並查獲私運人犯數名，聞本案與XX區鹽務管理局本縣第三分處有重大關係云。」</p>
<p>案是發了，事情鬧大了，辦事處職員們紛把這消息告訴姚老頭子；姚老頭子得知之下，震驚是震驚，但畢竟是老狐狸，臉上反擺出一副熟練的鎮靜態度：</p>
<p>「我姚老頭子決不幹運私貨勾當，這種事外頭謠言是難免的，本來麼，弄鹽務這門公事飯，就是這點難吃……呃，好在我姚老頭子不要錢，辦清公事，實硬，怕誰？……」</p>
<p>過兩天，縣警察局派來兩名警士，攜來一件公函，一張傳票，找姚老頭子去。公函上說：</p>
<p>「……該案盼貴局即予協助偵查；……該第三分處主任姚XX，膽大妄為，應嚴予查辦……」</p>
<p>姚老頭子看見這總局的公函，震驚是震驚，但仍不免裝出副若無其事的精神，自說自話的哼著說：「我姚老頭子決不幹運私貨勾當，去就去，反正，我姚老頭子不要錢，辦清公事，實硬，怕誰……」</p>

<h3>怎樣使我的孩子身體健康</h3>
<p>— 演方</p>
<p>我是一個有三個孩子的母親，我的孩子都是自己喂奶，當心，雖則費了很多的財力，精力和時間，還是免不掉有時要害病，不過在發育方面，似乎還能達到標準的程度。我將我九年來的經騐，和關心孩子的母親，談一談：</p>
<p>（一）孩子從出世到十歲中，不容易沒有疾病，不過每個時期的疾病不同——</p>
<p>A吃母乳的嬰孩，在六個月以內，不易害病，因為少和外界接觸，終日吃睡，所以在未斷奶以前，胖的孩子居多，然而一待斷奶，便逐漸瘦下去，且呈衰弱之象，傷風，咳嗽，肺炎便易發生了，而且淋巴腺發炎，亦於斷奶後不久為最多，要防止此層，就是在六個月以後，即須注意嬰孩飲食衛生，除奶以外，必須加入各種食品，如蔬菜雞蛋等類，使他的腸胃習慣各種飲食，可以每月或每半月添進一種新食品，而必須營養而易消化者，最初極少分量，以後逐漸加多，則一旦斷奶，對於身體不受影響，仍能保持吃奶時之肥胖健康矣。</p>
<p>B一歲到三歲，是最討厭最麻煩的時候，容易吃壞，著冷，感冒，誤將危險品嚥下，以及從桌子上，櫥窗下跌下來。在此時期，食物宜注意消化，營養，平日不外出，不入公共場所，（公園除外）若不能有人隨時看護，則至少給他一個沒有危險性的環境，如用木柵，或桌椅把他圍起來，任憑他在地上爬，玩，走，跳，都可。</p>
<p>C三歲到五歲已漸漸懂事，儘可獨自玩木頭汽車等等。不能吃的東西，絕對不許吃，許多習慣，在此時期已甚明顯，所以必須十分注意他的行動，有時可以稍加責罰，頗能有效。一個健康的孩子，。在此時期，衣著行動已能自主，若在飲食方面，特別注意，寒暖當心，就不易害病。</p>
<p>D五歲到十歲是在學校時間居多，此時與外界多接觸，易於傳染各種疾病，所以應時防疫針，牛痘等，決不可疏忽，延宕。</p>
<p>（二）每天應注意的事——</p>
<p>A大小便是否正常——小孩一定要每日有定時大便，及多次小便，若是大便色白，不正常，必係腸胃不消化，最簡便都減少其食量，多喝開水，若有可疑黏性物，則有下痢之患，必延醫診治。</p>
<p>B性情忽然暴躁，煩惱，或夜眠不安，——小孩天性活潑快樂，偶有異象，必是身體上不舒服，此時當量量體溫，看喉部是否紅腫，舌苔正常否，若因消化不良之故，吃些潤腸藥，通暢大便。倘不見效，延醫診治。</p>
<p>C忽然胃口不好——小孩不想食物，切莫勉強，先換換種類，如仍不想吃，則聽之亦可。有時較大孩子，因工作太心精神緊張，也會胃口不好，倘每天有正常大便，小吃亦無關係，只要營養而清潔的食物，吃了自然有益。</p>
<p>D食量甚大而骨瘦如柴——此種現象乃因　所有飲食並無營養價值，僅是給牙齒及腸胃做做工作。　腸胃中有寄生蟲，必須檢騐大便，蟲排出以後，能漸健康。</p>
<p>（三）給小孩們最優良的待遇——</p>
<p>A食物</p>
<p>（一）重質不重量，無益的食物，絕對不吃。</p>
<p>（二）食物有定時，絕對不吃閒食。</p>
<p>（三）多喝開水。</p>
<p>（四）多吃水果，中國人現在雖然也知道水果多維他命，可是往往忽略了清潔一層，反多出各種腸胃病，因為菓皮上的細菌很多，極易帶到水菓內部，尤其是香蕉，所以水菓必先用鐵錳養洗或至少用開水泡過再去皮吃。</p>
<p>B睡眠——睡眠同食物相等的重要。</p>
<p>（一）五歲以下的孩子，除晚上睡覺以外，午後一定要有一二小時的睡眠。</p>
<p>（二）晚上不要帶小孩外出應酬，遊玩，使小孩太興奮，失去安眠。</p>
<p>（三）被褥舒適，夏日避免蚊蟲臭蟲等吸　。</p>
<p>（四）臨睡前不吃食物，晚飯不太飽。</p>
<p>C環境——小孩除掉入學，遊公園外，儘可能使他家中有機會玩。給他充分的玩具，好的伴侶，簡易的運動器具，使孩子能消磨他的光陰，不想零食，亦不想在里中閒蕩，年紀稍大的，可以出外做小客人，或在家中做小主人，而五歲以上的孩子，已很能閱讀各種故事，亦是導入正途的辦法。</p>
<p>D家中人的合作——中國舊式家庭中的尊長，喜歡給孩子吃，不論何時，何物，一見小孩，就要給他吃，要他吃得不停，就是現在新式一些的人也難免此弊，這是很不利於小孩的。因為小孩的腸胃容量極小，在不是進食的時間，給他填滿了食物，反使他正餐胃口不好，也就是反而奪去他一餐營養品，我的孩子在飢餓的時候，能一次吃完半磅鮮奶，但是在吃過二塊餅乾，及至午餐，又吃不下飯了，所以家中人必要合作。可能的話，應當由一個比較有醫學常識的人，帶領孩子，每天注意孩子的各方面才好。</p>
<p>E醫學顧問——孩子既然免不掉疾病，最好指定一位有經騐的醫生診治，看慣的醫生，對於你的孩子有記錄，知道孩子的體質如何，病歷如何，而且一遇急症，不致於慌得手足無措，因為有許多種傳染病，小孩免不掉是要傳染到的：</p>
<p>（1.）痧子——此症雖無危險，但但是有併發症，醫生能為你輸血血給孩子，使他出痧子時不困難，已出痧子，可以吃藥防肺炎等。</p>
<p>（2.）白喉——可打白喉預防針。</p>
<p>（3.）牛痘及防疫針——此點我們中國人現在也很相信，而肯注射了。</p>
<p>（4.）百日咳——從前以為百日要咳讓他咳百日才能愈，其實現在亦有預防之法。在百日咳盛行之時，可以打預防針，已患之後一面就醫一面注意孩子的營養，使他能補足咳的消耗。</p>
<p>（5.）腦膜炎腥紅熱等危險症——此類病盛行時，絕對不入公共場所若鄰居中有患此症者必送隔離醫院以免蔓延傳染。</p>
<p>以上各點，都是極普通而中等以上的家庭可以辦得到的。然而這決不是一朝一夕之功，做母親的人養育孩子。要當他一件工作，像父親每日上辦公室一樣的重要。使孩子工作，遊戲，休息，睡眠及飲食都有一定的時間，則不但身體健康，且對於小孩將來的生活方法亦有關係。孩子若在糊裏糊塗中長大，所謂帶病延年，等到一旦想有健康的身體，可就來不及，更不是吃幾粒維他命丸所可補救的。</p>
<h3>番茄</h3>
<p>— 慕燕</p>
<p>現在又是番茄當令的時候了。</p>
<p>番茄別名西紅柿。其實稱之為「茄」不如稱之為「柿」的來得貼切，因為它無論在形態，內容與色澤上都類柿而不類茄。不過番茄之名沿用已慣，所以我也襲用這個俗稱了。</p>
<p>它原產美洲，十六世紀起時輸入歐洲，那時義大利人呼之為「金蘋果」，英法人叫它做「愛之果」，顧名思義，可以想見它美麗的形態是如何的逗人喜愛了。</p>
<p>它的肉厚而多汁，含有人體所必需的各種維他命，就中以維他命A最為豐富，B次之，C亦多。此外並含有鐵，燐，鈣，等繼質，可說是全能的營養物。</p>
<p>把他生啖，雖然沒有像柿子那末甜美，可是吃慣了也自有一種風味。若用開水泡過，剝去外皮蘸了糖吃，其味更佳。把它煮湯，味甚鮮美。</p>
<p>總之，它是一種可口而又有高度營養價值的果實，是值得我們經常食用的。</p>
<h3>女人是「人」</h3>
<p>— 燕</p>
<p>報載溫州有一商人名林震庭的，於八九年前結婚，育有二女，藉口無子，另納一妾，後該妾也生一女，林某怒其不生子，迫她下堂，再娶一個女子名稱玉秀的為妾。誰知道五年內連生二女，沒有半個兒子。林某平日喜怒無常，妻妾頗受虐待。近來玉秀以另有所歡，乃提出離婚要求，林某倒不忍相捨，哭求玉秀仍存夫婦名義，並表示此外任何條件，都可接受。但玉秀意志已決，不為所動，拿嬉笑來報丈夫的哀哭，結果由人處，解除婚約，玉秀同了新歡遠去了。</p>
<p>棄妾被妾棄，說一句迷信話，是因果報就。但我們知道，這是由於時代進步了，女人們覺悟到她們是「人」，而不是生殖機器。</p>
<h3>DDT的流弊</h3>
<p>— 如水</p>
<p>DDT問世以來，風頭很健，在農業上立下了不朽的功業，但經過科學家的再三研究，知道它殺滅害蟲固然效力無比，而同時卻影響了別的生物，尤其把它投入水中撲滅　孓時，對魚類的生存，有了威脅。如果魚塘中撒下DDT，魚的產量便大減下去。</p>
<p>按大魚吃小魚的例，小魚吃些什麼呢？研究魚類的人告訴我們小魚吃的是微生物，這些東西雖然小的可憐，卻是小魚的最好食料，有了小魚，大魚當然不會餓死了。如果這些小東西都死了，小魚就難以生存，大魚也養不活了。</p>
<p>美國安德孫教授最近作了一次實騐，證明這事是千真萬確的。他把小到人眼不大注意的水蚤，聚集起來，投下微量DDT，卅二小時之內，這些小東西僵化了過半。他說，濃度在十億分之一至一百中間的DDT中，微生物可以在十六至卅二小時中僵去，濃度若小於十億分之一，牠們還可以生存，他是取伊利湖的水為例的。有些地方，牠們的壽命可以延長到一三〇小時。</p>
<p>因此，要撲滅水中蚊蟲的幼子時，在有些地方，我們不能不考慮到魚類的生命！</p>

<h3>水</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>今夏，也不知是什麽道理，到處在鬧水災，除了花園口及洪澤湖這兩處是共軍的德政銘刻於人民心中之外，其餘如漢口水位已達二十五公尺餘，情勢緊急；綏西黃河水位高漲，各渠決口；杭州街道積水如渠，西湖水離岸僅尺許；富春江上看得見冲下來的木材，房屋，傢具；蘇州水災嚴重，楓橋至滸　關十里塘岸冲毁，塘旁一片汪洋，太湖水位劇升，民二十年之大水慘景又將重演；上海則大雨之後，蒲石路一帶沉在水裏好多天，連林森中路也淹沒過，許多市民都曾身受其惠來。</p>
<p>水災的原因，總不出三個原因：山洪暴發；堤防失修，排水渠及下水道出了毛病或根本不完善。</p>
<p>中國是個靠天吃飯的國家，但人定勝天，並不是夢想，如果堤防堅固沒有決口，（當然最理想的治水方法應是「開流」而不是「防流」，但目前怕還談不到。）排水有渠，下水有道，則雖發山洪，水都會萬源歸海，又何至泛濫成災？山洪不比破堤，別的國家也會有的呀。</p>
<p>修堤修渠，刻不容緩，民二十年秋可以說是爲了東北不暇兼顧，今年可已是勝利的次年了。</p>
<h3>武官下馬·文官停車</h3>
<p>— 魯軍</p>
<p>南京的「首都招待所」雜寫</p>
<p>在四川住慣了的人，對於小縣份裏的「未晚先投宿」「雞鳴早看天」的小旅館，都懷着一種戒懼的心理。有些小旅館還是用那古式的大床，印花藍布的帳子，一年四季墊着稻草。臭蟲，跳虱多得無法統計，使人一夜到天亮合不攏眼皮。而他們還在門口掛着「學仕停車，高人下馬」的紅燈籠，眞使人不敢領敎！</p>
<p>政府還都以前，南京房荒閙得嚴重。旅館也多未復業。於是，市長馬超俊發起籌設一個「首都招待所」，在開幕的那天，馬市長還親自前往主持。</p>
<p>這個招待所和一般旅館相同，也是收費，不過收得較少。住宿時的手續，是繳一張出差證或者機關服務證件，所以，商人們是不予招待的。招待所的地點很適中，在夫子廟的貢院街，一共有房間五十個，過去這裏是日本的一家咖啡館，規模相當大。招待所用了一部份房間和樓上全部，就把下面租給一家金谷酒家開設舞廳，收入倒也不差，可惜現在南京「禁舞」了，金谷大有關門趨勢，招待所方面，正在登報招標，重行出租，並且因爲夏天已至，咖啡座生意興隆，連後面沿秦淮河的空地，樓上的大客廳，也一齊租出去，但第一次開標沒有結果，正在重行招標中。</p>
<p>因爲這裏不招待非「公敎人員」，所以，一些想住的人祗有望「所」而興嘆。那些剛由各地飛來的大員們，都在這裏被招待下來，上海地政局長祝平，就在這裏住了半個月，××軍參謀長也在這裏住了很久，眞所謂「武官下馬，文官停車」了。不過他們有一個規定，就是住了十天以後，再要繼續住下去，就要加價百分之四十，超過廿天要加百分之六十，以示限制，表云他們並不歡迎長期住宿！</p>
<p>裏面的設備，除了樓下的萬象癥是由舞塲改爲歌塲外，樓上有一個彈子房，一個販賣部，南京市第三區區公所，也在這裏辦公。</p>
<p>招待所因爲是「官」營的，所以免捐稅。他們有一個理事會一，黨政軍團各界長官都是理事，下面還有一個總幹事，組織上看起來好像上座衙門，決不像一個旅館。</p>
<h3>南京房荒　不患寡而患不均</h3>
<p>— 路金</p>
<p>報紙上，天天用特號鉛字標着題：南京閙房荒。政府官員，常常發表談話：南京鬧房荒！小公務員還都歸來，喊破了喉嚨：南京閙房荒！於是，像煞有介事，南京眞像鬧房荒了。其實，否也！</p>
<p>爲什麽南京目前房子不够住，爲什麽很多人找不到房屋，簡單明瞭的說：分配不合理，不平均！</p>
<p>政府全部還都了，這樣多的機關衙門，多的大小人等，再加上這樣多的夫人少爺，於是，住便成了一個嚴重的問題。但，假如你有辦法，你有路道，一樣的可以解決房屋問題的。現在南京的大小學校以及敵僞產業，全由軍字頭的機關住下了，門口站上一個衛兵，其實，里面是空空如也的。從前的鐵道部，現在改作行政院的大房子里，就到處空着，一個××老爺住上一座洋房，一個公差也住上一個房間，太太少爺自然要住上三間五間。黃埔路的僞軍校里，房子空着沒有辦法，甚至天天在鬧鬼。很多很多日本商店上面還貼着封條，裏面也是變成堆積垃圾和老鼠的世界。……這樣多的不合理的事情，你說：叫南京怎麽不閙房荒？叫那些小公務員到那里去找房子？</p>
<p>美國運來的活動房屋，南京祗分到五十座，現在不但沒有裝好，而且一部份材料竟不翼而飛的失蹤了，一般人祗有望屋而興嘆。大小旅社儘多，但幾千元錢一天，不是普通人所負担得起的</p>
<p>其實，解決南京房荒的問題很簡單，我的妙計有三條：第一條是把非法佔領的房屋和沒有啓封的房屋，作合理的分配，第二條是利用南京各處空地，建築簡單的平民住宅，南京有的是空地，中山東路現在正在着手進行了。第三條：說來比較空洞，但　起來也未嘗不容易。就是征用那些不必要的歌舞塲和戲茶廳，闢作臨時的公寓，以解决還都公務員的房荒問題。果眞這樣，南京還會閙房荒嗎？</p>

<p>印度人有一雙有趣的手。在吃飯的時候，東方人是用筷的，西方人則用刀叉，但印度人像新疆民族吃「抓飯」時一樣，用一雙原始的手，以一只手抓起了飯，再用另一只手捻了幾下，便放在嘴裏，。可是這雙手在吃時有用外，在大便時竟也盡了很大的功用，那便是在大便後以手來代替草紙。工作完畢，然後在他們經常携帶藏水的簞中一洗。那只簞是小小的，出外時並不携在手中，而頂在頭上，有時我們可以在影片中看到。可是等到渴的時候，便將簞中的水作為飲料。這在我們看了一定很奇怪，但在他們是一種習慣了。</p>
<h3>沉悶的首都劇運</h3>
<p>— 維成</p>
<p>中旅劇團老關唐槐秋，在若干年前，眞是劇壇上的風雲人物。那個不知，那個不曉，可惜，現在是落伍了，不得不帶着殘缺不全的班子，躱在南京夫子廟的角落里一家小得祗能容納八百人的小劇塲「飛龍閣」里混口飯吃吃。</p>
<p>現在飛龍閣的門口，除了演出的劇名外，唐槐秋的名字，倒也很使人注意。他們的導演有孫璐湯琦等，主角是唐若靑，林納，賣座還算不差。這次南京人報發起南京十二名人競選，唐若青也被選出。</p>
<p>上演的劇本，有些是唐老關自已編的，還脫不了過去的「生意經」的作風，尤其是「獨幕劇」的演出，和十年以前的「旅行魔術團」作風完全一樣，使人笑笑而已！最近作風略略改變，正在上演曹禺的名作「原野」「雷雨」等劇，門票每張一千六百元，生意還算不差，不過他們的開支是很大的，吃飯已經不容易，租塲子要錢，演員還要零用錢！</p>
<p>這年頭什麼都在閙着不景氣，我們的話劇界自然也不能例外。一個話劇演員的生活，和平劇的女演員比較起來，眞有天壤之別，這是大家深爲不平的。中旅也是如此！</p>
<p>南京話劇的演出，祗有中旅一家。所以，說句嚴格的話，他們演出的成績是不怎麼好的，這叫做獨行生意，沒有誰和他們競爭，自然馬馬虎虎，敷衍了事。有幾個戲，導演的技巧還算成功，但由於佈景的粗製濫造，還是彌補不了這個缺陷。假如這是在上海的話，無疑的，中旅一定會給打倒！</p>
<p>中旅劇團在南京，說不上什麼轟轟烈烈，也說不上什麽成績，祗是平平淡淡，混口飯吃吃而已！因此，很多人認爲這是南京話劇界的沒落，也是中旅的日暮途窮的時候！以過去中旅的歷史來說：這是十分可惜的！</p>
<h3>首都之聲</h3>
<p>— 西廷</p>
<p>—南京的音樂活動</p>
<p>音樂與戲劇，在南京都十分沉寂；不過，比起來，還是音樂的氣象略爲好些。</p>
<p>當淪陷時期，僞方曾經主持一個「首都和運歌詠團」，是僞市長周學昌的「功績」。勝利以後，「和運歌詠團」的鋼琴由靑年團接收，但新的歌詠團一時尚未組織起來，也不易組織</p>
<p>小規模的「音樂晚會」，「音樂茶會」以及貧乏的演奏會，在勝利後曾經舉行過五六次，但是由於種種困難，由於南京一般風氣較爲遲鈍，都沒有引起社會的注視，相反的，舞塲「音樂」，流行小調，却顯得特別走紅。在上海的馬路上，還聽不到像南京新街口，太平路那一帶那樣熱閙的歌聲。</p>
<p>不過，還都以後，音樂氣氛在首都逐漸改變過來，勵志社的管弦樂隊，雖然羽毛未豐，但他對於倡　純正音樂，在南京，却有很大作用。最近常有演奏，而且勵志社地點確也不差，一進去，令人心曠神怡。</p>
<p>最　動南京音樂界的，是六月十八日女歌唱家管喻宜萱女士在勵志社舉行的歌唱會。成績的確驚人。尤其她所選的幾個中國曲子都非常討好，一方面配胃口，一方面也並不俗氣。「滿江紅」，「我住長江頭」，「茶花女中的飲酒歌」，「思鄕曲」，這四支曲子，博得觀衆極大興趣。尤其「滿江紅」與「茶花女中的飲酒歌」，都重唱一遍。</p>
<p>此外伍正謙最近也在京表演過一次，他是與低音提琴手紀漢文先生合作的。</p>
<p>勵志社樂劇股推行首都樂運很努力，我想一定可以一掃京城的沉悶。</p>
<p>國樂方面，大同樂會亦在京開始復員，中央廣播電台的「中國管弦樂」亦在復員，道些都是首都樂界的佳音。</p>
<p>這是我離京前（六月底）的首都音樂界槪略動態。</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳名（八）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>你在病中雖有信奉耶敎的傾向，可是沒有受過洗禮，還不能算是耶敎徒；而一方面你也不信佛，不信僧道因此你生平可說是沒有甚麼宗敎信仰的。不過葆妹她們以爲依從社會習俗，少不了僧道的點綴，所以請了鄰近關帝廟裏三名道士來給你分路，使你剛出竅的靈魂不致迷失；當晚又請了觀音堂中五個僧人來做繫念的佛事，鐘聲鐃鈸和唪經唸佛之聲，直鬧到天明。我把膽瓶中供着的紅薔薇和白香水花全都放在你的身上，你本來很愛這些花的，可憐你此刻無知無覺，又那裏再能領略它們的色香啊！</p>
<p>第二天早上，鄒荊老得了凶訊，忽忽趕來了，伴着錚兒去購辦壽器和衾被荷花帽觀音兜之類，我因為對於這些事是全本外行，一切都重託了他老人家。這一天，據道士說是甚麼「重喪日」，不宜放入殮的，只得陳屍在家；到了傍晚時，梅杏瑛三女已接到了昨晚的急電，都從上海奔喪回來了；她們因爲不曾送你的終，長跪在你的牀前，哭得分外的傷心。這時六個子女，都已到了你的身邊，你死而有知，總該愼目了吧？入夜以後，又請了五個尼姑來，再做一塲繫念的佛事；我因身心都已疲乏，再也支撐不住，就到梅屋中去睡了。</p>
<p>第三天據說又是「重喪日」，依例仍然不能入殮，但是入殮時只須把一個泥佛背人偷放在棺中，就不妨事；我們決意照這麽辦，淸早七點鐘，由葆妹給你梳好了頭，貼身換上了新製的紡綢衣　，纔由壽星橋仁濟殯儀館中派夫役來把你的遺體接了去，可憐的鳳啊！從此一去，你再也回不到你生前所最愛的這一座花木扶疎的家園中來了！我在蘇州，連一個親戚都沒有，眞所謂「舉目無親」，就是朋友也寥寥可數，一共不滿二十人；雖在明報上登了個報喪的廣吿，大家未必留意，幸而鄒荊老給我拉了幾位熱誠好友來；十一點鐘時，你的弟弟鴻鑫，內姪　城，梅婿鏡人，杏婿俊卿，合夥兒從上海趕到了，總算有了親戚，也有了朋友，就在午後二時，舉行了殯殮的儀式。我和六個子女眼瞧你躺到靈柩中去，都避踊號啕，痛不欲生，尤其是廿九年來和你相依爲命的我，心碎了，腸斷了，恨不得伴着你長眠在一起啊！</p>

<h3>Disrupting the Government's Ceasefire Order: Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Launch General Offensive; Taixing's Situation Unclear, Taixian Surrounded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 14th, Communist forces approached the southern suburbs of Taixing. As of the 15th, the situation in Taixing remains unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th Dispatch] The shift of the war's focus to northern Jiangsu has become an almost unavoidable reality. According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the morale in Yangzhou and Taixian is extremely stable. This morning, our reporter interviewed the highest military authority stationed in Yangzhou, who stated: The Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have not only violated the government's ceasefire order, but are also continuously expanding their territory, attacking cities and seizing land, attempting to achieve their so-called "Northern Jiangsu Liberated Zone" ambition. In particular, in recent weeks, the Communist forces have been extensively deploying troops and generals, dreaming of attacking our Yangzhou and Taizhou areas. For the sake of self-defense, if the Communist forces rashly invade, we will deal them a head-on blow.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yinzhang, 15th Dispatch] Taixing is under siege by Communist forces, and the situation is increasingly tense. The county magistrate of the county, Xue Peiqi, sent a special telegram to the provincial authorities on the 15th, reporting that "Dai Xin'kuan's Provisional Second Division of the Communist forces, and six regiments of Su Yu's force, infiltrated the county from Zhangjiaqiao in the Eighth District and Daikexiang in the First District. As of the morning of the 14th, fierce fighting was still ongoing, with minor clashes in Yaojiazhuang and Shili Dian." Furthermore, according to a military reconnaissance report, the south gate of Taixing has been captured by the Communist forces, and the highway between Taixing and the port has also been cut off by the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th Dispatch] According to an urgent telegram from Taixian: Communist forces at Tangtou and Jiegou, eighteen li west of Taixian, attacked the National Army forces there at 1:00 PM on the 14th. Another part of the Communist forces attacked the National Army near Wujiaqiao in the southwest. As of the morning of the 15th, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Within Taixian city, the sound of machine guns and artillery could be heard clearly, and a special curfew was announced in the evening. Furthermore, after the Guangfu Bridge on the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway was destroyed and cut off by the Communist forces, our National Army is making every effort to lift the siege and repair it. It is generally expected that there will be major developments in northern Jiangsu in three days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] Two to three hundred Communist soldiers from Jingjiang, disguised in plainclothes with short guns, are stirring up trouble in Majing, Changli, and Zhengxin townships near the city. Their sentries have reached Sanguandian Jijiashi, twenty-three li west of the city, and the civilians have all been driven to the Huangqiao front line, with no way to escape.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wuxi, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces have launched a full-scale general offensive against northern Jiangsu. On the 13th, one route of the Communist army with 20,000 troops attacked the suburbs of Taixing. On the 14th, they fiercely attacked the city walls, resulting in heavy casualties for the defending National Army regiment. On the morning of the 15th, the south gate of the city was breached, and the situation in Taixing City was unclear as of noon. One regiment of the National Army stationed at Xuanjiabao north of the city was surrounded by six regiments of the Communist forces, suffering especially heavy casualties. The regiment commander, Xia Luo, is missing. Another route of about 8,000 troops is attacking the area east of Changzhou. The outskirts of Taixian are infiltrated by Communist forces on all sides and have fallen into encirclement. Another force of more than 20,000 is attacking Liuhe from the northeast, west, and south with great momentum. The Communist forces besieging Haimen continue to receive reinforcements, and the attack is fierce, with the city walls in danger.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces on the Front Line Increase to Over 130,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces have launched a large-scale political offensive against northern Jiangsu. The forces they are using on the front line have increased to over 130,000 and are now launching a full-scale general offensive in various locations. (1) The Communist forces under Chen Yusheng, who attacked Taixing City on the 13th, are continuing to advance south of Taixing along the north bank of the Yangtze River. Six regiments of their New First Division are fiercely attacking Kou'an Town (on the north bank of the Yangtze River south of Taixian). (2) A part of the Second Division of the Communist forces attacked the area east of Yangzhou on the 12th and was driven back by the National Army on the 13th. Another part infiltrated the highway between Yangzhou and Taixian, destroying the road. As of noon on the 15th, that section of the highway had been cut off. (3) The Communist forces attacking Liuhe have continued to receive reinforcements, reaching over 25,000 in the area of Shiguanji (northwest of Liuhe), Zhuzhen, Majiaji (all north of Liuhe), and Babaiqiao (northeast of Liuhe) by the 14th. They are continuing to fiercely attack Liuhe from the north, west, and east, attempting to seize Liuhe and threaten Nanjing. (4) Over 10,000 Communist forces, advancing towards Lai'an and Jiashan, are attacking the suburbs of those two cities with great momentum. (5) Over 20,000 Communist forces on the northwest and east sides of Donghai are attacking the National Army with great ferocity. (6) Over 30,000 Communist forces in Jiangshan, Zhangji (both southeast of Xuzhou), and Suyangshan (northeast of Xuzhou) are continuing to advance towards the outskirts of Xuzhou. (7) Over 20,000 Communist forces pressing towards Dangshan have now approached the east and west ends of Dangshan, and the situation in the county towns along the Longhai Railway is quite precarious.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Southern Henan Raid Xichuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th Dispatch] A large part of Li Xiannian's Communist forces are raiding Xichuan, and the National Army is intercepting them. Furthermore, about 10,000 troops under Wang Shusen's Communist forces have crossed the Xiang River again to the west. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the National Army in the areas of Kuaihualin, Leijiahe, and Yinghe'nao in Yinxi. A part of them has been cut off into several small groups and are running around everywhere.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] The mediation of the conflict in the Henan-Hubei border area is being handled directly by Marshal Ma. However, the Ninth Group in Wuhan has not been able to establish contact with Li Xiannian's forces due to their unpredictable movements. Therefore, it has not yet been decided whether to designate a new stationing area for them or order them to move north. Today, a certain official spokesman stated that Li Xiannian's forces are attempting to establish their base in Wudang Mountain in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. Another spokesman stated that Li's forces intend to cross the Yellow River to the north, but because the Longhai Railway is heavily guarded by the National Army, they are scurrying between Fuxun Mountain and Wudang Mountain.</p>
<h3>Datong Situation Tense; Clashes Occur Frequently in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Relevant authorities announced today that Communist forces have begun attacking Datong since yesterday. Our reporter went to the private residence of General Ma Zhanshan to inquire about the truth. According to a certain military officer who arrived here from Datong yesterday afternoon, the atmosphere in Datong is indeed quite tense, and clashes occur frequently in the suburbs. Yao Shan, the commander of the Communist Suiyuan-Mongolia Military Region responsible for the area, reportedly arrived at Zhoushizhuang, forty li east of Datong, on the 13th. However, as of the time he left Datong, a large-scale battle had not yet broken out. According to someone who came from Datong today, the situation there has not changed. Most of Nie Rongzhen's troops, who were originally around Datong, have moved south. The Communist forces now taking over the defense are newly transferred from Rehe, and their numbers are estimated to be about 20,000 to 30,000. The National Army currently defending Datong is two divisions of Ma Zhanshan's Northeast Advance Army and two regiments of Chu Xichun's troops, as well as some local teams. Ma's troops were originally ordered to reorganize into the Third Cavalry Brigade, but the reorganization has been temporarily suspended due to the tense military situation. Currently, code forts, barb wire and entrenchments are densely distributed in the suburbs of Datong. Ma's troops have obtained better equipment, and many munitions have been airlifted from Beiping. There is also a considerable amount of food. If the Communist forces launch a large-scale siege, they can also hold out for a considerable period of time.</p>
<h3>Officers and Soldiers of the New Fourth Army Defect to the National Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th Dispatch] Dozens of officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army Independent Brigade, including Jiao Huaicheng, carrying weapons, defected to Boshan and surrendered to the National Army. The authorities have promised to allow them to rehabilitate themselves, providing funds for dismissal or joining the National Army according to their wishes.</p>
<h3>National Army Forces in Qingdao and Jinan Join Forces Near Gaomi; Ministry of Communications Prepares to Expedite Repairs to the Jiaoji Railway Line</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Officials told reporters today that the National Army forces in Qingdao and Jinan have joined forces near Gaomi, and the Jiaoji Railway line is almost cleared. The Ministry of Communications is now preparing to expedite repairs to the Jiaoji Line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th Dispatch] Since Chen Yi rejected Clarmann's mediation, the stagnant situation in Shandong has suddenly become serious again. In recent days, the Communist forces within the territory have been frequently mobilized, appearing to have new intentions. However, government officials have not completely given up hope for peaceful negotiations. Commander Wang Yaowu told reporters today that "peacefully resolving the Shandong issue is the government's consistent policy, and I still have great hope and confidence in this. If Chen Yi accepts the American mediation and goes to Qingdao for negotiations, I am still ready to meet with him at any time."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces' attempt to occupy Qingxian in order to cut off the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and then directly take Cangxian has completely failed due to the National Army's increased defenses. According to reports, the Communist forces once rushed to the north gate of Qingxian on the morning of the 6th. At that time, the defending troops and security teams bravely resisted and immediately repelled them. The chief of staff of their 63rd division was also killed in action. The area near Qingxian has become calm, and the two regiments of Communist forces concentrated near Cangxian have also retreated to the area of Wangshan Temple in the southeast of the county due to the National Army's increased strength. The National Army has recently garrisoned various important strongholds near Cangxian, thus strengthening the city's defenses.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Buffer Zone North of the Songhua River Rejected by the Communists; Doolittle-Lin Meeting Difficult to Realize in the Near Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Officials stated that the American proposal to establish a buffer zone along the Hongwu line on the north bank of the Songhua River has been rejected by the Communist forces. The Communist forces insist that the National Army should withdraw south of the Songhua River. A certain influential person also told our reporter that there will not be major changes in the Northeast military and political personnel recently, and that Gu Zhutong will be in charge of Northeast affairs, which is not true.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th Dispatch] The Doolittle-Lin meeting will be difficult to realize in the near future. When our reporter visited Wu Xiuquan, Lin Biao's representative in Changchun, Wu said: "Regarding this matter, Lin sent a telegram from Harbin on the 13th, saying that he was too busy and unwell to attend the meeting as invited. After receiving this telegram on the 14th, I immediately forwarded it to the American representatives and informed the government representatives of this intention in the afternoon. However, I believe there will still be opportunities to meet in the future, and at the same time, this matter will not affect the peace in the Northeast."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 14th Dispatch] Although the Doolittle-Lin meeting has now been postponed twice, it is learned that the American representative of the Military Mediation Department in Changchun, De Bermen, is still making continuous efforts, so it cannot be said that it has reached a state of complete despair. According to the observations of most people here, the stagnation of the Nanjing negotiations is directly related to this matter, and the anxiety of the general public is greater than in the past.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th Dispatch] Liao Yaoxiang went to Dehui (located northeast of Changchun) on the morning of the 15th to inspect the defenses.</p>
<h3>Democratic League Hosts Reporters Yesterday, Explaining Their Stance on National Affairs</h3>

Then, Zhang Bojun and Zhang Shenfu delivered speeches successively, explaining the Democratic League's position and stance on national affairs. At the same time, they also made some statements regarding the assassination of Li Gongpu. After the report, reporters from various newspapers raised questions about the proportion of military reorganization and the Communist Party's repeated new demands, with very sharp words. Our reporter also asked, "What criticism does the Democratic League have of the Communist Party's actions in northern Jiangsu?" Luo Longji did not give a direct answer, only saying that the situation in various places is very chaotic, not just in northern Jiangsu, and so on. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM, and then Western reporters were invited to give a speech.</p>
<h3>Chinese Communist Party Demands Representation at Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference</h3>

<h3>Chen Zhiping Most Popular Candidate for First Ambassador to the Philippines</h3>

<h3>Wang Yintai, a Major Traitor in North China, to be Publicly Tried in Beijing Today</h3>
<p>The High Court Interrogated the Renegade Shen Changgeng Yesterday; the Trial Lasted Eight and a Half Hours</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Wang Yintai, a major traitor in North China, is scheduled to be publicly tried at the Capital High Court at 9:00 AM on the 16th. It is rumored that President Zhao Chen will personally serve as the presiding judge in this case. Wang's notorious reputation has spread throughout the country, and it is expected that the Chaotian Palace will be extremely crowded tomorrow. Today, Jin Shiding, the presiding judge of the High Court, set a new record for the longest trial of a traitor when he tried Shen Changgeng, the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Stock Exchange, an economic giant traitor. The trial lasted from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, without a moment's rest. The defendant's lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Duanmu Kai, also brought a water bottle with them to quench their thirst.</p>
<h3>Mei Siping's Request for Retrial Rejected by Beijing High Court</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Regarding Mei Siping's request for a retrial, the Capital High Court announced its ruling at 6:00 PM on the 15th: "The request for a retrial is rejected." It is understood that this ruling was the result of deliberations by Jin Shiding, the presiding judge of the court, and two judges at 12:00 PM today, and its content refutes each of the reasons cited in the original application one by one.</p>
<h3>To Strengthen National Defense and Self-Defense Forces, We Must Implement a Conscription System</h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi Reports at the Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 15th. After the ceremony was led by President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported. Minister Bai first described the significance of national defense, saying: "National defense is self-defense, and the purpose of national defense is to protect the independence and survival of the country." He then stated: "Modern national defense is universal, comprehensive, scientific, and artistic." Mr. Bai then listed the development of military science in various countries during the Second World War and the mobilization of countries such as Britain and the United States to illustrate the necessary conditions for modern national defense. When discussing China's future mobilization, Mr. Bai emphasized that it is important to strengthen the organization of the people and train a national guard system. He stated that maintaining a large standing army during peacetime is beyond the country's financial capacity. Therefore, a conscription system must be implemented, and the national guard should be used to replenish the troops. Chairman Chiang has also recently instructed that the conditions for organizing and training the people must be accelerated in order to establish a sound national guard system. Mr. Bai finally expressed his hope that this system would be implemented as soon as possible in order to strengthen the country's self-defense forces and strive to protect the country's independence and survival. The ceremony ended at 9:45 AM.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Mrs. Marshall flew to Jiujiang at 9:00 AM this morning. Marshall himself escorted her to the Jiujiang Ertao Kou Airport and then flew back, arriving in Beijing at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Stuart rode with his personal advisor, Chuan Jinbo, on Marshall’s special plane to Beijing at 9:30 this morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] The new U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, arrived in Beijing at 12:30 PM today. Mr. Stuart arrived on Marshall's five-star special plane, which flew to Beijing on the afternoon of the 13th specially to greet him. From 11:00 AM, a crowd of reporters had been waiting at the airport. Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Colonel Ke Yi of Marshall's Mansion, Schmeis, Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy, Colonel Kenney, Naval Attache, Dong Biwu, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, and more than 20 alumni of Yenching University all arrived at Daxiaochang Airport one after another. At 12:25 PM, the sound of an airplane reported from the horizon that the plane with a dazzling gold gleam had arrived. Five minutes later, the giant aircraft landed, and the hatches slowly opened. Mr. Stuart was the first to disembark, and standing next to him was the graceful and beautiful Ms. Xie Bingxin, the famous Chinese writer who was as elegant as her prose. Ambassador Stuart then shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Our reporter was the first to ask for an autograph, and the Ambassador humbly said in Beijing dialect, "I don't write well!" However, he still signed his Chinese name on the back of the reporter's business card. Mr. Stuart is very tall, wearing a gray suit with thin white stripes today, brown leather shoes, a light blue checkered tie, and holding a chic cane. When he disembarked, he took off his dark felt hat, revealing his graying hair. He looked around at the welcomers with a very calm gaze and spoke to them one by one. About eight minutes later, he took a horse-drawn carriage to the U.S. Embassy to rest. In addition to Ms. Bingxin, those who arrived in Beijing with Ambassador Stuart included his Chinese advisor, Chuan Jingbo, and his old friend, Paul.</p>
<p>Marshall Hosts a Banquet to Welcome Him</p>

At 6:30 PM, he drove out again, first to visit his advisor, Chuan Jingbo, who had caught a cold due to the flight, at No. 6 Yihe Road. He then went to Marshall's Mansion, had dinner with Marshall, and watched the movie "Inlamgier" at Marshall's invitation until 10:25 PM before leaving and returning to the Embassy on Shanghai Road.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Special Envoy Marshall quietly hosted a banquet for the new U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, at his residence tonight. Ambassador Stuart did not want to make any public statements before discussing the matter with Marshall.</p>
<p>Receives Our Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart received the Ta Kung Pao reporter alone in the parlor of the American embassy at 10:25 tonight. It is said that he was only busy with private affairs this afternoon and is scheduled to contact our Ministry of Foreign Affairs tomorrow to determine his program of activities for the next few days. The Ambassador said that the presentation of his credentials may take place in Lushan, but it depends on Chairman Jiang's decision before he can finalize his itinerary with Marshall. When the reporter asked him when he would invite CCP representative Zhou Enlai for a meeting, the Ambassador replied: Before meeting Chairman Jiang, he did not want to formally meet with anyone. The Ambassador repeatedly emphasized that his current priority was to present his credentials, and he could not accurately predict any work before presenting his credentials. The reporter asked whether he was prepared to hold regular press conferences. The Ambassador also said that he had no such plans yet but wished to meet with reporters as much as possible and would provide news whenever possible. The Ambassador also earnestly stated: he loved China, and he came out as ambassador this time entirely as a scholar, to work hard for Sino-US friendship and to help Marshall for China’s peace. He sincerely hoped that his work would not fail. When the reporter said good night and left, it was 10:41 PM. The moonlight was shining on the mountains and rivers, and the city was gradually quieting down. The Ambassador's earnest and grave voice lingered in his mind and he could not help himself.</p>
<p>May Fly to Xun Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Regarding Ambassador Stuart's presentation of credentials and performance of his duties as ambassador, our reporter inquired with Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>Where People Are</h3>

<h3>Seven U.S. Soldiers Suddenly Abducted Near Xin'nanzhuang, Qinhuangdao; Believed to be the Work of the Communists; U.S. and Chinese Military Forces Dispatched to Search</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] The commander of the U.S. Navy in China, Luo Ji, announced today that seven U.S. sailors were captured by an unidentified force of about eighty people last week. As of 9:00 AM this morning, their whereabouts were still unknown. According to Chinese press reports, this was the work of the Communist Party. The sailors were ordered to go out to buy ice and were surrounded and captured in Xin'nanzhuang, 22 miles southwest of Qinhuangdao near the Great Wall. One of them was hidden in the grass by a Chinese and escaped. He later fled back to the commander of the detachment at Bridge No. 99-02 near Qinhuangdao on the Beining Line and reported that his seven companions had been arrested. Soldiers from the garrison camps in Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe have been ordered to be on alert and search nearby villages to find the missing personnel. A search team consisting of 28 soldiers and a National Army detachment began searching on Saturday night. U.S. Navy aircraft also participated, but their movements were hampered by bad weather. As of 9:00 AM this morning, no news had been received about them. However, the jeep and trailer used by the ice buyers were found at the scene.</p>
<h3>Our Nation's Post-War Reconstruction: A Five-Year Plan Proposed, Implementation Divided into Eight Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] It is reported: The government has drafted a "Five-Year Reconstruction Plan" for our nation's post-war reconstruction. This plan is extremely large in scale, encompassing transportation, industry, water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, and mineral resources sectors. The implementation area is divided into eight regions: Northeast, North China, Central China, South China, Northwest, Southwest, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. In terms of management methods, with the exception of ordnance, munitions, oil mines, steel, hydroelectric power, and coking coal, which will be state-owned, the remainder will adopt private or joint public-private operation methods. The total estimated cost is 22 billion yuan in pre-war currency, with the transportation sector accounting for 38% of the total. However, the realization of this plan depends entirely on the stability of the situation in the future.</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Visits Chiang Ting-fu Yesterday to Discuss the Yellow River Closure Project; Preliminary Agreement Reached on Funding Issues</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, Communist Party Representative Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Xiaoyi, the Communist Party's Yellow River levee restoration project representative, Cheng Run, the Communist Party representative from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and interpreter Zhang Wenjin, visited Director Chiang Ting-fu of the Executive Headquarters to discuss matters related to the Yellow River closure and levee restoration project. Those participating in the discussion included Kesick, advisor to the UNRRA Office in China, Faulkner, the representative of the acting director of that office, Glenn, an UNRRA agricultural expert, and Todd, the American engineer in charge of this Yellow River diversion project. Mr. Todd first reported on the current status of the project, stating that the Yellow River's return to its old course would soon be realized, and there would be no danger to farmers on both banks of the lower reaches. Mr. Zhou expressed deep concern that this would endanger the Communist Party areas in the lower reaches, and stated his willingness to personally inspect the actual situation at the project site in order to decide whether the closure should be carried out immediately. The Director of the Executive Headquarters suggested that the technical issues should be left to the experts to decide, and that the decision on whether to close the river immediately should be entrusted to the Yellow River Engineering Committee, to be decided by a majority vote. (Note: This committee consists of six members, including two from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, two Communist Party representatives, and one each from the Executive Headquarters and UNRRA). Mr. Zhou believed that the majority opinion might not include the Communist Party's opinion, and that it should be effective only after unanimous approval by all representatives of the committee. The two sides failed to reach a concrete decision on the veto power issue. Mr. Chiang assured that when the levee restoration project is carried out in the Communist Party area in the lower reaches of the old Yellow River course, the Executive Headquarters will bear the cost of work relief in order to ensure that the entire Yellow River no longer poses a threat to North China. After the water is released, the Executive Headquarters will provide relief to the residents in the river channel of the old course. The discussion ended at 11:30 AM when Mr. Zhou departed. The discussion resumed in the afternoon and concluded at 6:00 PM. It is reported that the two sides have reached a preliminary agreement on the funding of the levee restoration project, namely, that a portion of the work relief funds will be allocated by the Executive Headquarters to the Henan branch and then exchanged for Communist Party currency to pay engineering wages in the Communist Party area, and the remaining funds will be jointly decided and allocated by the two parties for the purpose of purchasing post-disaster relief materials needed in the Communist Party area. Regarding work relief food supplies, experts reported in May that 6,000 tons of grain were needed. Mr. Zhou indicated that this should be increased. As a result of today's meeting, Mr. Chiang agreed to first allocate 8,600 tons of grain to be transported to the Communist Party area of the old Yellow River course to carry out work relief. As for the total amount of work relief food supplies, it will be decided next Thursday during continued discussion.</p>
<p>[Further News] It is reported that Zhou Enlai is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today.</p>
<h3>La Guardia Sends Telegram Severely Reprimanding Branch Personnel</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] After more than 300 staff members of the UNRRA Office in China sent a joint telegram to La Guardia, criticizing the unequal distribution of relief materials, causing a great uproar, Mr. Lai, the Director of the UNRRA Office in China, quietly held a very simple wedding with his female secretary after office hours, and then left for the old capital, as if to distance himself from the matter. However, he has recently received another telegram from La Guardia, severely reprimanding him, which stated in brief: "I do not approve of publishing this telegram; this kind of situation must not occur again in the future." Although the telegram praised the spirit of service of UNRRA staff in China, it also pointed out: "This kind of publicity not only hinders the spirit of seamless cooperation, but also, considering the scale of the UNRRA organization, this kind of behavior violates the discipline that is necessary in such an organization." La Guardia stated that as of the date of the telegram (July 11), he himself had not yet received the original telegram from the more than 300 staff members in Shanghai, and unexpectedly, the Shanghai side disregarded the approval of the US authorities and hastily published the telegram.</p>
<h3>Han River Water Level Gradually Recedes</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 15th] From 12:00 noon to 4:00 PM today, the water level in Wuhan has slowly receded by one inch. Upon hearing the news, the citizens showed joyful expressions. Around the Jianghan Customs House, crowds of people came and went to observe the water. It is said that some elderly people, holding paper, burned it along the river to show their farewell to the "water demon." However, after 4:00 PM, the water level returned to a stagnant state, so the feeling of worry has not been completely dispelled.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Enemy Property Management Bureau Embezzlement Case Judgement: Section Chief and Accountant Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Inner Mongolian Political Situation in Turmoil: The Eastern Mongolian Side Launches a So-Called Purge Movement; Communist Party Sends Personnel to Infiltrate Western Mongolia with Great Effort</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] With the flames of war still raging within the country, the situation in Inner Mongolia is becoming increasingly turbulent. According to yet unconfirmed information from Mongolian sources here, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Movement Committee, formerly in Zhangjiakou, has moved east to Chifeng in Jehol and merged with the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government, with Communist Party member Yun Ze as chairman and Bo Shengmandu, leader of the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government, as vice chairman. In addition, an Eastern Mongolian branch of the Mongolian Autonomous Movement Committee has been established in Wangyemiao, Eastern Mongolia. The radical faction in Wangyemiao is now rising in prominence. It is said that former Eastern Mongolian representatives Mani Badar and others, who were dispatched to Beijing to petition but were prevented from doing so by the Northeast Headquarters, have been killed by the radical faction in Wangyemiao, with only Sanjie Zhabu escaping. The Eastern Mongolian side has launched a "purge" and "struggle" movement, and society is extremely turbulent. Currently, the Communist army in Western Mongolia (mainly referring to the Xilingol League area) has not yet entered the territory of the Mongolian banners, but each banner has dispatched staff to carry out propaganda and education work, but has not yet been drawn into the vortex of struggle. The banners still possess self-defense troops, and local order is very good, but after last year's passage of large armies, livestock losses have been significant, and people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Mongolian people from Chahar Province residing in Beiping, represented by Senggelingqin Bayantai and fifteen others, sent a telegram to the chairman and Mao Zedong, opposing the designation of Chahar Province as a stationing area for the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Provinces Exempted from Land Tax in the 35th Year Divided into Two Years for Averaged Exemption; National Government Issues Order Prohibiting Grain Administration Personnel from Harassing the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The National Government issued an order on the 15th: (1) Regarding this year's land tax, for the purpose of regulating food supply and stabilizing the domestic economy, it is still necessary to continue to levy in kind and purchase in kind, which is truly unavoidable. All levels of grain administration personnel must be honest and impartial in their duties and handle matters carefully. If there are any acts of corruption, self-enrichment, or harassment of the people, they will be severely punished according to law once verified, and the supervisory and public opinion and judicial organs at all levels are instructed to correct and expose them at any time in order to maintain official integrity. (2) Regarding the land tax of various provinces, it was previously ordered on September 3 of last year to exempt them from taxation for one year at different times. Now, in order to regulate food supply and stabilize the domestic economy, the method of exempting land tax has been appropriately changed. All nine provinces that were to be exempted from land tax in the 35th year, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and Chongqing City, will be uniformly divided into two years for averaged exemption. Half will be exempted this year, and the remaining half will be exempted next year.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction of the Qiantang River Bridge Requires 1 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The Qiantang River Bridge, which connects the eastern and western parts of Zhejiang Province, was just completed when the War of Resistance broke out. When the National Army withdrew from Hangzhou, it was damaged. Later, the enemy repaired it, and the National Army also repeatedly damaged it. This great bridge was never utilized by the invaders. After the victory, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Ministry of Communications began to restore it. Although it can barely be used now, the bridge piers have been severely damaged. If repairs are not made soon, it may be difficult to maintain it for long. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has drafted a plan to carry out repairs and add a motor vehicle lane. The estimated cost is about 1 billion yuan, which is currently under review by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Assumes Office at the Ministry</h3>

<h3>Local Dispatches: Continuous Rain Causes Disaster in Northern Anhui; Many Areas Along the Huai River Become Waterlogged; Disaster Victims Desperately Await Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent] In recent years, northern Anhui has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities. In the northeast counties, the Communist army has continued to harass them, and in the northwest counties, floods have struck again. Since the beginning of the month, continuous rain has been pouring down, and areas along the Huai River have been turned into lakes. Many fields and houses have been submerged. The affected areas include Shou County, Fengtai, Fuyang, Yingshang, Taihe, Huoqiu, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Bo County, and Huaiyuan County. The wheat harvest in these counties suffered from wind and insect damage, and the harvest was poor, with each mu not yielding enough seeds. Due to the shallow and silted riverbeds and lakes along the Huai River, water levels rise sharply and the embankments collapse when there is continuous rain. The autumn crops that the people were hoping for have all been flooded, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of dan of autumn grain. Shou and Fengtai counties are the most severely affected, with a vast expanse of water outside the city. Many refugees are battling the storms and waves in small boats. The Longyuan area of Huaiyuan, due to its proximity to the Wo River, has downstream sedimentation, making it difficult for the turbid flow to discharge, resulting in backflow into the Huai River. More than a thousand houses have been washed away, and there are many instances of villages running out of food. In Guoyang, the floodwaters overflow, and the water is blocked by the embankment, causing six or seven li on both sides of the Fei River to be submerged. In Taihe, due to the lack of water conservancy repairs, water has accumulated in the city, disrupting traffic. Autumn crops along the Gu River, Ci River, and Bazhang River have all been submerged. The long-distance bus from Bengbu to Fuyang has been suspended for several days due to flooding on the highway. Small steamers operating on the Huai River have been extremely crowded in recent days. The restoration of the Huai River embankment has been greatly affected. The water level of the Huai River here has risen sharply by more than ten feet in recent days, and due to the current flood season, the water level is continuing to rise. The disaster-stricken counties have reported the disaster situation to the Anhui Provincial Government one after another, appealing for relief. The Anhui Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also preparing to provide emergency relief to save the people.</p>
<h3>National Army in Taixing, With Only One Company, Repels the Strong Attack of Two Communist Regiments</h3>
<p>[Our Jingjiang Correspondent] The Communist army led a force of two regiments to attack Shilidian the day before yesterday. The National Army stationed there only had one company and was surrounded. However, the soldiers fought calmly and without fear. The Communist army launched eight assaults, with soldiers falling one after another, and dead bodies piled up like mountains. Shells exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. After holding out for seven hours, the National Army stationed in the city received the news and came to support, and the Communist army began to retreat. In total, the Communist army suffered over a thousand casualties, while the National Army only had five minor injuries. Zhao Fengcheng, the regimental commander of the Independent Regiment, cried loudly after retreating to Huangqiao, considering the losses to be heavy.</p>

<p>Recent Cost of Living Index in Hangzhou</p>
<p>In order to understand the living standards of workers in various industries in Hangzhou and to seek improvements, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Social Affairs specially compiles a cost of living index for workers on a monthly basis, using the average prices from January to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) as the base period, selecting 29 essential items, and dispatching personnel to various districts to conduct investigations and statistics. The cost of living index in June continued to rise, with the total index reaching 426.870 times the base period. Among them, clothing was the highest, accounting for 715.565 times the base period. Compared with the previous month, the rise in rent was the most significant. The details are as follows: Food category: 480.844 times, Clothing category: 715.565 times, Fuel category: 442.763 times, Miscellaneous category: 282.111 times, Rent category: 205.533 times.</p>

<p>Epidemic Prevails, Rescue Implemented</p>
<p>Recently, an epidemic has been prevalent in Maqiao District, Shanghai County. Patients die within a few hours of onset, and the situation is very dangerous and severe, threatening to spread to neighboring areas. Zhu Yangzhong, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and others donated large sums of money to purchase epidemic prevention medicines in Shanghai, dispatched personnel to the countryside to distribute epidemic prevention medicines, and administer preventive injections as a remedy.</p>
<h3>Editorial: A Longing for Sweet Rain Amidst Oppressive Discomfort</h3>
<p>When Mr. Hu Shih arrived in Nanjing, our newspaper reporter inquired about his impressions of the "political atmosphere" in Nanjing. This former Chinese Ambassador to the United States smiled and replied, "The weather hasn't changed at all; it's stifling and hot. It needs rain." This truly demonstrates the refined and detached spirit of a scholar serving as a diplomat. Nanjing is indeed stifling and hot. Meteorological statistics show that Nanjing's average temperature is three to five degrees higher than coastal areas. It really needs some rain to alleviate the oppressive feeling of these midsummer nights. Our newspaper reporter asked Mr. Hu about his impressions of the "political atmosphere" in Nanjing. Since he mentioned "atmosphere," the temperature in Nanjing must be quite low, hence the stifling heat and the need for rain. People hope for some coolness to relieve their oppressive feelings, they hope for rain. This is true in nature, and it is also true in the "political atmosphere."</p>
<p>Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders until now, it has been from high summer through autumn and winter, even into the present summer. The Chinese people, especially the working class and peasantry, have endured eight years of prolonged resistance and all hope that victory can bring them stability and peace, so that they can be liberated from eight years of suffering and have a chance to recuperate. However, in this past year, the government has returned to the capital, but the people have not only failed to return to their hometowns, but even the loyal people who originally lived in the countryside have been displaced because of the victory in the war of resistance. The refugees from northern Jiangsu who fill Nanjing and Shanghai today are the fruits of the victory in the war of resistance. What makes them leave their homes and struggle with death is not the Japanese "Imperial Army," but the armed forces of the Chinese Communist Party, who call themselves "liberators." What are they "liberating"? They are stripping away all their meager private property, making it impossible for them to live in peace, and banishing them to wander in strange lands. Wander…! Eight years of prolonged resistance won victory, but it still brings them wandering. Our government should certainly feel ashamed, and even the Chinese people feel ashamed towards these displaced compatriots from Jiangdong. This is due to the people's ineffective supervision of the government, causing them to suffer displacement and hardship again after the victory in the war of resistance. However, they understand that what brings them this misfortune is none other than the gift of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party wants to "liberate" them, banishing them to live this wandering and precarious life. Not to mention other regions, "Northern Jiangsu" is close to Nanjing and Shanghai. The situation in "Northern Jiangsu" is most clearly understood by the citizens of Shanghai. They receive various reports, they understand the truth of this picture of exile, and they give their hope and trust to the government, to our great Allied nations, and to their special envoy, General Marshall. Even the "Democratic League," which has always expressed sympathy for the CCP, one of its many leaders, perhaps because he grew up in Jiangsu, is naturally more familiar with the situation in "Northern Jiangsu," and also expresses dissatisfaction with the CCP's actions in "Northern Jiangsu," hoping that they will change their ways. In this past year, from the year since the Japanese surrender, it should be well known who is harming the lives of the people and the life of the nation. The people hope that the government can save them from their plight, and that the Allied nations can understand the true situation in China. They have hoped for a year, like waiting for clouds and rain in a great drought, but the high sky is now filled with dark clouds, and the dense clouds do not bring rain. Mr. Hu Shih said, "It's stifling and hot, it needs rain." It really needs rain, but when will the rain fall, and when will it bring a feeling of coolness?</p>
<p>It is in this mood that we welcome the new appointment of the American Ambassador to China. The newly appointed ambassador is none other than Mr. John Leighton Stuart, an old friend of China. Mr. Stuart grew up in China, is tired of politics, and has a genuine understanding of China. Because he is tired of politics, it is really a matter of necessity that he takes on the role of ambassador at the age of seventy. He loves his own country and he loves our China. In such a time of crisis, it is truly our hope that Mr. Stuart does not decline the appointment as ambassador due to his advanced age. We hope that due to the appointment of John Leighton Stuart, hostility can be turned into friendship. Although the Chinese people have a clear understanding of the CCP, because they are all Chinese people, they always hope that the CCP can prioritize national interests. This is because China needs stability and recuperation after a long war of resistance. Therefore, although the CCP negotiates on the one hand, and creates new situations on the other hand, puts forward unreasonable and harsh conditions, and does not fulfill their promises, such as the recklessness of Lin Biao and Chen Yi, the people sympathize with the government's tolerance, because the government does not want to resort to arms, hoping that the people can have a chance to recuperate. This is a policy of appeasement, but Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and their ilk are ultimately not Hitler, and the people understand the government's difficulties. What the Chinese people do not understand is that the CCP has achieved its current position thanks to the assistance of our Allied nations, but the CCP is now launching anti-propaganda and anti-Allied propaganda everywhere. At this time, the head of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration publicly sent a letter to the CCP, giving the CCP's illegal regime a de facto recognition. The Chinese people do not understand what kind of policy this is. The appointment of Mr. John Leighton Stuart as ambassador gives the Chinese people a new hope, and gives the CCP a new opportunity. We hope that Mr. John Leighton Stuart can fulfill this hope of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Here, we must frankly point out that although the people can sympathize with the government's policy of appeasement towards the Communist Party, they cannot condone the government abandoning what it should do. In the political sphere, the implementation of constitutional government and a fresh start with the people has always been the government's consistent policy, so the reorganization of the government to include people outside the Kuomintang, and the determination of the list of National Assembly representatives to formulate the fundamental law of the country, must not be delayed due to the CCP's procrastination. The CCP is ultimately a minority party in China, and we must never delay the majority because of the minority. As for the rectification of officialdom and the punishment of corruption, these are originally the government's responsibilities, and they cannot be repeatedly delayed because the political situation is not yet clear. The people sympathize with the government's policy on handling political issues, but they hope that it can have thorough and factual manifestations in its own responsibilities to strengthen their trust in the government. For example, in the Shanghai grain loan case, after many days of investigation, there are disputes between the local court and the military court, resulting in the criminals either going unpunished or not being brought to justice according to the law. How can such procrastination gain the trust of the people? Furthermore, regarding the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was originally passed at the Sixth National Congress, and the division between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises is clearly defined. Now, after the victory in the war of resistance, state-owned enterprises are rising up, even in the item of sugar, state-owned and provincial-owned institutions are competing with the people for profits, and the rulers of the country only believe that they are competing with merchants for profits, denying that there is competition with the people for profits. However, it is not known that merchants and the people are originally one body, the people are the merchants, and the merchants are the people. When both the upper and lower classes compete for profits, the country is in danger! We hope that the government will quickly advance what it should do within its responsibilities, and not disappoint the people again.</p>
<p>Stopping war to establish peace, the people's eager desire for governance is like waiting for clouds and rain in a long drought, hoping that sweet rain will fall soon, so that in this oppressive temperature, they can get some coolness. We hope that both the government and the CCP will prioritize the interests of the people and the interests of the nation. We also hope that the new American Ambassador to China can fulfill his lofty mission.</p>

<h3>Churchill Encourages France to Strive for Self-Improvement and Work Together to Revive Europe to Lead the Continent Back to Peace and Freedom</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Metz, France, 14th] Former British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, speaking at a banquet held by the Metz City Council today, advocated the organization of a unified Europe to prevent the great new world institutions from becoming incompetent. Churchill also emphasized the necessity of a strong France, saying that the French people, after saving themselves, will be able to save Europe, and saving Europe means saving the world. Churchill said, "I have been with France for forty years. France is now in a difficult position, and I am still following her footsteps. I have come here to give you encouragement after going through a dark period together. I believe that France will be able to restore its glorious past and contribute to a reasonable and lasting peace." For decades, Britain and France have advanced together, fought shoulder to shoulder, and finally fulfilled their responsibilities and defeated the invaders. May we continue to be together and never separate.</p>
<p>Although France won a glorious victory in the First World War, its wounds were very serious, and almost all of its blood had been drained. We must not forget that France sacrificed two million people for the war aims of the Allies. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, it was actually possible to prevent it simply by prohibiting German armament. During the Second World War, I bore a part of the task, and I never allowed the slightest rift to arise between Britain and France. You must never let this rift occur. History has made our two great nations form an inseparable and inviolable relationship. We must not make any mistakes in the future, and future affairs should be undertaken by those who understand the meaning of history. Churchill mentioned the reason for coming to Metz, saying that at the beginning of the North African campaign, General Giraud had agreed with me to meet in Metz, and now the goal has been achieved. When General de Gaulle received me in Paris in November 1944, I also talked to him about this appointment, and he said that he would be able to fulfill it. General de Gaulle and I have never expressed disappointment in the greatness of France, and we firmly believe that the final victory must belong to us.</p>
<p>Finally, Churchill said that he would like to talk about two real problems. The first is the European problem. Churchill said: "We have been taken advantage of by Germany twice, and we must not let this happen again. Without a unified and united Europe, the great new world institutions, even under the leadership of the United States, will inevitably be futile." Both explosions originated in Europe, so we should first think of Europe. The second is the French problem. Without a strong France, there is no hope for the revival of Europe. No country needs to be strong more than France today. In short, we must strengthen unity and form "a unified nation." I would like to offer you faithful advice as a loyal old friend, that the nation must be united to lead Europe back to peace and freedom. If France can save itself! It will be able to save Europe, and saving Europe is saving the world.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 14th] After Churchill delivered his speech at the Metz City Hall, he drove to Luxembourg. When he arrived at the town of Thionville on the border, he was surrounded by the public, and the enthusiasm was exciting.</p>
<p>Truman's Broadcast Greetings</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] President Truman broadcast to the French President and people on French National Day, saying that the French people are celebrating the first peaceful National Day since 1939. Two years ago, we were fighting the Germans in French territory. A year ago, the war in the Far East was nearing its end, and France was already engaged in reconstruction. Although France has encountered two misfortunes in the past twenty-five years, it still stands on the front line of the world's free nations, proclaiming the same principles of freedom as 157 years ago. I would like to take this great anniversary to pay tribute to your country on behalf of the people of your country.</p>

<h3>The World's Ideological and Economic Struggles; The Two Major Blocs Are Increasingly Clear; U.S. President Approves Loan to Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] A White House spokesman said; President Truman is expected to sign the $3.75 billion Anglo-American loan agreement on Monday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th Special Dispatch] The reaction here to Congress's passage of the loan bill to Britain generally focuses on the benefits of Anglo-American trade and its impact on future world economic cooperation. However, some observers in the United States also emphasize that this action by the United States contains significant political significance. They frankly pointed out that after the establishment of the Anglo-American financial agreement, Moscow will now stand in opposition to the united front of non-Soviet countries economically. These observers further stated that the Soviet Union's "belligerent" strategy in the United Nations meetings and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference convinced many members of Congress and their constituents that the world is now in a struggle between two ideologies, and that those who voted against the loan to Britain were equal to abandoning the principles of British democracy, which is why the loan supporters won.</p>

<h3>Developments in Europe; U.S.-Soviet Relations Deteriorate; U.S. Policy Deliberations Toward the Soviet Union May Change</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 15th Dispatch: U.S.-Soviet relations in Europe have undergone important developments today, and the results of the developments may prompt the United States to change its basic policy toward the Soviet Union. The most important development is the statement by U.S. Compensation Commissioner Pauley. Pauley recently visited Germany and Austria, and it is said that the Soviet Union has taken away various materials from Germany without authorization, which is a clear violation of the Potsdam Agreement. It is believed that if the Soviet Union continues to violate the Potsdam Agreement and insists on unreasonable compensation demands, the United States may change its basic policy toward the Soviet Union. Another important event is that of the four missing U.S. soldiers, two of whom have been proven to have been arrested by the Soviets. The Soviet side stated that these two were arrested by "some Soviet officers" because the Americans had arrested them. This point can prove the degree of deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations in Europe. Another incident is that of Soviet Navy Lt. Letyun, who is on trial in Seattle for attempting to obtain atomic secrets. The debate has ended, and Letyun may be sentenced to death.</p>

Each group of two balloons can be separated so that soldiers can land in the United States and carry out conspiracy attacks. This type of balloon travels at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Headquarters Explains Japanese Labor Legislation, Responding to Soviet Suggestions</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, 14th) The Economic and Scientific Section of Headquarters issued a statement today, pointing out that certain individuals, using exaggerated propaganda, terror tactics, and deceptive skills, are attempting to gain leadership of the Japanese labor movement. Their purpose is to subject the Japanese people entirely to the control of leftists, reversing the previous situation of being governed by rightists. This statement is intended to respond to the twenty-two suggestions made by the Soviet representative Teryaevianko to the Allied Council for Japan, who argued that the Japanese government should revise its labor legislation. In fact, the principles of those suggestions have all, or in part, appeared in existing Japanese laws.

<h3>Inaugural Meeting Held on August 13th, General Meeting to Open on September 9th, Provisional City Council to End at the End of July, Mayor Wu Invites City Councilors to Discuss Preparations Before the Meeting</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Yesterday, Mayor Wu held a meeting at the New Life Club for the first session of city councilors, to discuss preparations before the establishment of the city council. One hundred and sixty-one councilors attended. First, Wu Le gave a welcome speech, saying that Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, and the Shanghai City Council should serve as a model for city councils across the country. He hoped that everyone would "openly and frankly" cooperate, and the city government would sincerely accept everyone's suggestions, while also appealing to everyone about its own difficulties and hoping to be given some time to improve. If this spirit can be maintained, then "the government and the council will be one family" and will surely achieve success. The purpose of today's tea party: The central government stipulates that the inaugural meeting of the city council is to be convened by the city government. Now, a tea party is held first, so that everyone can jointly decide on the date of the meeting. Regarding the issue of the meeting venue, the city council is the highest meeting of the city, and a suitable venue should be found in the future. At present, opinions are also being solicited.</p>
<p>Speeches by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker</p>
<p>Then, Xu Qi, Speaker of the Provisional City Council, delivered a speech, praising Mayor Wu's past spirit of cooperation with the councilors of Hankou and Chongqing, and reported that the Provisional City Council should adjourn at the end of July. He proposed that the new city council be established on August 1st. As for the venue, he suggested still using the address of the Provisional City Council on Nanchang Road, or the Fuming Village on Middle Zheng Road. Later, Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu proposed the former German school on Daxi Road, where more than one hundred American soldiers now live. If a solution can be found for their accommodation, it can be used as a venue. The establishment of the general assembly should be as early as possible. He also said that with the Mayor's past experience and style, respecting the opinions of the city councilors, the formal general meeting would be established in the future, with the slogans "the government and the council are one family" and "openness and frankness", and the results will surely be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Various Opinions Expressed</p>
<p>Subsequently, Councilor Zhai expressed his opinion, believing that there should be adequate preparation before the meeting, and the meeting period can be slightly later. The city government's financial budget must be prepared as soon as possible, and should be increased to alleviate the heavy burden of life for civil servants. Zhong Keto advocated holding the inaugural meeting on August 1st, and the meeting might as well be held a little later. Gu Zhuxuan advocated that the date be decided by the mayor, without further discussion. The mayor then stated: Since taking office, seventy to eighty percent of the time has been spent on temporary problems, and municipal administration has been delayed. The preparation and establishment of the budget is now decided to be completed around the end of July. The city government is responsible for implementation, and the city councilors are responsible for legislation. If the city council is successful, it can immediately make foreign countries feel that Chinese politics is on track. Abroad, meetings are held most often in spring and autumn. Summer is too hot, and people are mentally tired, and it is easy to act hastily. Therefore, my opinion is to hold the inaugural meeting on "August 13th" to elect the speaker and deputy speaker, and to open the first session on September 1st. The city government report and budget can be submitted at that time. There are three possible venues: the Provisional City Council address on Nanchang Road, the former German school, and the former Japanese Overseas Chinese Autonomous Association, etc., but these are all practical issues, so it is advocated to authorize the City Council Secretariat to prepare. Feng Youju felt that the grand Journalist's Day would be held on September 1st, and dead journalists would be mourned, which would be very inconvenient for journalist councilors, and requested postponement. Finally, Pan Gongzhan suggested holding the general meeting on September 9th to commemorate the victory and surrender. The result was unanimously passed. After the meeting, journalist councilors Pan Gongzhan, Zhao Junhao, Shi Yong, Feng Youju, Tang Shichang and the mayor, etc., took a group photo as a memento.</p>

<h3>Grain Loan Embezzlement Case, Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office Officially Holds Joint Trial, Wang Daren Interrogated for the Past Two Days, Ren Xingya and Grain Merchants to be Tried Today</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) After several days of silence, the grain loan embezzlement case officially began to be tried last Saturday. After receiving instructions from the highest authorities on the principles for handling the case, the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office formed a collegial panel, composed of Military Law Office Director Gu Zhaoyi, Office Secretary Li Zheng, and Military Judge Yu Shiyun, to conduct a joint trial. From Saturday afternoon to yesterday morning, Wang Daren was interrogated. Yesterday afternoon, Ren Xingya was tried. Ren Xingya will continue to be tried this morning, and starting this afternoon, all grain merchants will be tried. All account books of the grain merchants, except for those of Changjiang and Santai, which had been checked by the Accountants Association, have been collected in the past week. The five volumes stored at the District Attorney's Office were also brought yesterday and are being checked. It is expected that the entire case can be fully tried within one week.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau Embezzlement Case, Investigation Continued Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Kuling Becomes Summer Capital, New Shanghai-Jiujiang Air Route Opened</h3>
<p>With Chairman Chiang's presence in Lushan, Kuling has become the summer capital, and the number of travelers coming and going has increased sharply. In order to facilitate traffic between Shanghai and Jiujiang, the China National Aviation Corporation has opened a new Shanghai-Jiujiang air route.

<h3>Pay Attention to Usage of Nonfat Dry Milk</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributed milk powder to citizens in this city, including nonfat dry milk, which is used differently from regular milk powder. This type of milk powder is made by extracting cream and water from fresh milk. Every two ounces of milk powder can be mixed into sixteen ounces of milk water. It cannot be prepared and consumed like regular milk powder, but needs to be mixed with clean water into a paste, and then boiled for one minute with four times the amount of hot water. It needs to be stirred constantly while boiling in order to be drinkable. This type of milk powder should be stored tightly in a cool and dry place, and should not be exposed to the air to avoid clumping. Citizens who receive nonfat dry milk often throw it away because they do not know how to prepare and store it, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>Milk Powder Factory Closes Down, Unable to Withstand Foreign Competition</h3>
<p>The large-scale dumping of foreign milk powder has struck Chinese milk shops and milk powder manufacturers hard, and they are in a precarious situation. Currently, the United Milk Powder Factory has announced its closure and liquidation due to sluggish business and inability to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Stopping Registration of Rickshaws Will Cause Serious Consequences, Rickshaw Industry Representatives Petition</h3>
<p>In order to reduce traffic congestion and regulate urban traffic, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has ordered a halt to the registration of new private chartered rickshaws, tricycles, and motorized rickshaws. Upon hearing the news, the Rickshaw Industry Association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The industry believes that this move by the Public Utilities Bureau will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of more than seventy rickshaw manufacturing factories in the city, and materials worth billions of dollars, including finished and semi-finished products, will become waste. Moreover, thousands of technicians who have been trained in the industry for several years will have no job to change to, which will inevitably cause serious consequences. Therefore, seven representatives, including Yu Xingye, were selected to petition the Public Utilities Bureau, asking the government to show sympathy for the difficulties of businesses and provide relief, or postpone implementation.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Police Officers Disguised as Villagers Bust Large-Scale Drug Den, Multiple People Arrested at Renhe Hotel, Contraband Drugs Found Hidden in Toilets</h3>
<p>On the 12th, the Taishan Police Station received a tip that a large-scale drug den was set up in the Renhe Hotel on South Guangxi Road, selling 1-2 million units of drugs daily. They immediately summoned Judicial Section Chief Zhang Rou, section members Ha Jingang, Shao Guanrong, and plainclothes police officers Chen Fusheng, Zhang Wenqi, Wang Dongwan, Jin Zhongyuan, etc., disguised as villagers who had just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside. Each carried luggage and pretended to book rooms to lay in ambush. At around 10:00 PM, they first rushed to room 311, arresting the leading drug kingpin named Dai Heshang (38 years old, from Suzhou). They found 188 packets of white powder (i.e., morphine) of various sizes around him and hidden in toilets, each packet selling for 2,000, 6,000, and 10,000 units, as well as 1,950,800 units of cash. In rooms 322 and 325, they arrested drug users Huang Gengsheng, Sun Shiting, and Zhong Zhigui, and several packets of white powder, as well as drug paraphernalia. They then arrested Zhang Xingquan, the tea house foreman, an accomplice in the hotel, and found four packets of white powder on him, as well as Ye Jinting, the tea house attendant on duty, and found three packets of white powder on him. The hotel accountant, Zhang Xiangqing, was suspected of harboring the criminals, so he was also taken to the station. After questioning, Dai Heshang confessed to privately setting up a drug trafficking organization, but claimed that the white powder was bought from a Tao surnamed person at 12 Yide Lane, Dongxin Bridge. The rest of his confession was evasive. Zhang Xingquan and Ye Jinting also admitted that they committed illegal acts because their income was not enough. They were ordered to be detained and sent to the prosecutor's office for questioning. On the one hand, Director Song commended the officers for their meritorious service in solving the case. In addition, given the hotel's audacity to harbor criminals and sell drugs, he asked whether to revoke its license and awaited instructions from higher authorities.</p>
<p>[Another Report] White powder king Li Atu, residing at 46 Haige Lane, Guangyuan Road, was raided by the Xujiahui Police Station the night before. However, Li was out, and only Li's concubine, Li Yindi, from Qingpu, was caught.</p>

<h3>Government Agrees to Loan CN$800 Million to Minsheng Company First</h3>
<p>The future of Minsheng Company, which is in a precarious state, has attracted close attention from those concerned about private shipping companies.

Continue subsidies; 2. Adjust freight rates; 3. A large loan; 4. Reduce difference wheels. After listening to the details, the government agreed to first grant a loan of CN$800 million and expressed its willingness to consider the other points and provide assistance within its capabilities. The company hopes that the government's assistance can be implemented before the end of this month, so that shareholders will not decide to shut down the company at the shareholders' meeting in Chongqing on the 26th due to the loss of hope. Mr. Lu Zuofu is scheduled to go to Beijing again today to discuss everything with the government.</p>
<h3>Peking Opera Charity Performance for Five Days Raises CN$100 Million</h3>

We went to every place we could, and the refugees everywhere knelt down and cried, begging to be sent back to their hometowns. They are emaciated and miserable to behold. Preparations have been made to send them back and to find ways to prevent them from freezing and starving. Finally, thank you to all sectors for your enthusiastic relief and assistance." Next, Zhang Shizhao of the Hunan Disaster Relief Association reported, briefly stating: "The situation in Hunan is very different from other places, as it is a combination of floods, droughts, and epidemics. There are currently 30 million refugees. Slogans are plastered all over Changsha City: 'CN$20,000 saves a life.' I hope all sectors can save a few lives."

<h3>Trial of She Aizhen Completed, Verdict on Zhou Yuying et al. Scheduled for the 22nd</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] She Aizhen, the wife of Wu Shibin, the captain of the guard brigade of the "76" Special Operations Headquarters during the enemy-puppet period, was retried in the High Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Yu Zhongluo defended her. She wore a plain gauze short shirt and pants, barefoot, black cloth shoes, and a bun. When asked by the judge, she stated: 48 years old, from Guangdong, previously studied at Qixiu Girls' High School. Her husband, Wu Shibin, had a rough understanding of writing and worked at a gambling table in the French Concession before the war. In 1939, he was invited by Li Shiqun and his wife to join the "76" as the captain of the guard brigade. Due to the relationship between husband and wife, and for convenience of entry and exit, I also held the title of accountant, but I had nothing to do, just played mahjong and watched movies with the ladies above. Wu Shibin only took on internal work and never fired a gun or killed anyone. The "China Bank Massacre" was done by Zhang Guozhen on Li Shiqun's orders, and Wu did not participate. The rampant kidnapping and murder cases at that time were due to the chaotic world, and all the crimes were added to Wu. Later, Wu Shibin was detained by the Japanese for more than 50 days for wanting to leave "76". After being released, he suddenly died in Suzhou. His whole body turned black after death. As for saying that I was responsible for assessing the ideology of the guards, I am a housewife, I only know housework, and I have no political ideology, so how can I manage the thoughts of others? And I have never held the position of adjutant director. If I have assisted Wu Shibin, participated in opinions, or done a bad thing, you can shoot me, I will never regret it. The debate on the case was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Also, the case of Zhou Yuying, the head of the puppet Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau, and Li Haoju et al., suspected of being traitors, has also been tried, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Chen Jicheng on Trial, Also Claims to Have Saved People</h3>

<h3>Prodigal Son of a Wealthy Family: Wine Bars and Dance Halls, Reckless Check Writing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Boyuan, a plainclothes patrol officer from the Criminal Division of the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau, along with police chiefs Chen Wenbin, Liu Zhonghan, and Xu Jian, recently discovered a young man who claimed to be from a noble family, behaving lavishly. He always carried a briefcase and an unlicensed self-defense pistol, frequenting major dance halls, hotels, and restaurants, spending money like water and showing no restraint. After a secret investigation, it was discovered that the young man was solely engaged in deception to make a living. Consequently, at 3:30 AM on the 12th, they rushed to Room 303 of the Royal Hotel on North Sichuan Road (formerly Route Cardinal Mercier) and arrested him. He was taken to the bureau for questioning. The young man's name is Jiang Xincheng, also known as Guoqi, the fifth son of Jiang Hongbin. He is 23 years old and had studied at a certain university. His home address is No. 16, Sande Lane, Route Lűban. This young man lived in extreme extravagance, made friends indiscriminately, and indulged in debauchery. Lacking money, he had the fanciful idea of obtaining several checkbooks from banks such as Jin Cheng, Da Kang, and Zhejiang Industrial, recklessly issuing checks to conceal his empty grandiosity. Those deceived were mainly owners of high-end restaurants, hotels, and dance halls. It is estimated that he issued over three million in bad checks. Now, various victims are flocking to the sub-bureau to seek justice.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached to Stabilize Sugar Prices: Aiming to Restore the Previous Normal State</h3>
<p>After two weeks of effort, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has achieved a satisfactory solution for stabilizing sugar prices. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, he summoned Li Meiquan and others, permanent directors of the Sugar Industry Association, to inquire about the association's views on stabilizing sugar prices. At 11:00 AM, he invited Song Yixin, assistant manager and head of the business department of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, to discuss the matter. In the afternoon, after 6:00 PM, he invited both parties for a meeting. Attending from the Sugar Industry Association were Li Meiquan and two others. Attending from Taiwan Sugar Corporation were Song Yixin and Jin Boxiang. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that starting today, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will allocate 15,000 bags of sugar to the Sugar Industry Association, with each bag priced at 80,000 yuan. Sugar merchants will resell to sugar shops, with each bag not exceeding 86,000 yuan. If this price is exceeded, the government will take action. It was also stipulated that every Tuesday, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will make an allocation. Next Tuesday's allocation price will be reduced to no more than 75,000 yuan. Subsequently, the weekly allocation price will be gradually reduced in order to suppress sugar prices and restore them to the normal state before the recent price surge. Sugar confectionery manufacturers can apply directly to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for an allocation of sugar based on the company's allocation price, without going through sugar merchants, thereby reducing costs and hopefully lowering prices. It is reported that Minister Chen Lifu of the Central Organization Department was also present at this meeting.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Provincial High School to Recruit New Students Regularly</h3>
<p>A Total of Nine Classes for the First Year of Junior and Senior High School</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shanghai Provincial High School of Jiangsu Province was a famous high school in the country before the war. This spring, after moving to the original school site on Wu Jialong, Hu Min Road, in Shanghai, the city actively planned post-war revival. Yesterday, the school's principal, Dr. Shen Yizhen, made the following remarks to reporters: Shanghai Provincial High School was established in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and moved to the newly built school site in Caohejing in the 23rd year (1934). The entire school area is more than 500 acres, and all construction equipment meets the latest standards. Unfortunately, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was destroyed by enemy bandits, and more than half of the school buildings were destroyed. The loss of internal equipment was even worse. The estimate is more than 500 million yuan, even if simply. This spring, former Principal Xi Gu returned to Shanghai from Guanzhou to plan for restoration. In addition to asking the government for subsidies, he also solicited donations from all parties, reaching about 200 million yuan. Although it has not been collected yet, the school buildings have been able to be repaired initially, and daily school supplies have been able to be supplemented and added, thanks to this. I originally served in the Ministry of Education, responsible for supervising higher education work. Because of my many years of relationship with Shanghai Provincial High School, I could not bear to see such a good school destroyed by the war. I loved serving at the school in April of this year. Based on facts and needs, I formulated a revival plan. It is expected that it will be completed within the next five years, making Shanghai Provincial High School not only a national model high school but also among the world's famous high schools. Also learned: The school will recruit four classes for the first year of junior high school and five classes for the first year of senior high school in the fall. Registration will begin on the 27th at No. 560 Caishi Road. The examination period is scheduled for August 1st (junior high school) and 2nd and 3rd (senior high school).</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Chinese Davis Cup player Hsu Cheng-chi hopes to return to China this autumn after the end of the tennis season to reunite with his brother Cheng-hsiang in Shanghai after a decade of separation. At the outbreak of the war, Hsu was working for the British Dunlop Rubber Company in Batavia. He was imprisoned by the Japanese, and his tennis practice was neglected. He only resumed playing this year when he was appointed as a Davis Cup player. However, due to a lack of practice, he was eliminated by Dutch player Schwarze in the third week of the Wimbledon Championships. According to Hsu, speaking to a United Press reporter, "I hope to do better next year. If our country has considerable new talent, we can make progress, but our greatest need is for new equipment. For many years, Shanghai has not had a real grass tennis court, and we can only play with old balls and old rackets." Hsu also said that he would participate in more tournaments in England before returning to China in October.</p>

<p>The Morning Friends Red and Green teams from the Municipal YMCA went to the Soviet Union last Saturday at the invitation of the local Sports Association Preparatory Committee to participate in a charity tournament to raise funds. It is reported that the Morning Friends Red team returned to Shanghai at 2:00 AM yesterday. The Green team still has a match this afternoon, so they are scheduled to return to Shanghai this afternoon.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Office Orders Districts to Investigate Rice Shops and Banks Within Five Days</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Office sent a letter to each district office yesterday, stating: "Upon investigation of Mayor's instructions that each district office assist in handling the allocation of food rations, a meeting was convened, and three methods were discussed and approved, which were sent to each district of the city. In order to understand the distribution of rice shops and banks throughout the city, a rice shop and bank investigation form has been created and distributed to each district. Please investigate and fill out two copies within five days and submit them to the office for handling. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and must be handled promptly."</p>
<h3>Review of Public Official Candidates</h3>
<p>Examination Yuan Sends Telegram Urging Intensified Action</p>
<p>The Examination Committee of the Examination Yuan believes that more than half a year has passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and all occupied provinces and cities have been restored successively. The Ministry of Interior previously stipulated that civil organizations at all levels should be established in each occupied province and city within six months after recovery as the basis for implementing written administration. Holding reviews for provincial and county public official candidates is a prerequisite for the establishment of civil organizations at all levels. The number of people submitting documents for review in Shanghai is far less than the total number expected. A telegram was sent urging the municipal government to instruct its subordinates to expedite the review of public official candidates.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Receives Telegram from Executive Yuan, Hu Pu-an Approved to Fill Council Member Seat</h3>
<p>Pan Hsu-lun Transferred to Civil Servant Position</p>
<p>Pan Hsu-lun, a member of the Shanghai Provisional Council, was transferred to the position of Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, creating a vacancy. The Municipal Government received a telegram yesterday from the Executive Yuan, stating that Pan Hsu-lun had been transferred to a civil servant position and approving Hu Pu-an, an alternate council member, to fill the vacancy.</p>
<h3>Citizens Apply to Change Their Names</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Clarifies Three Points of Doubt</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously received a report from the 29th District Office, stating: "Upon investigation, many residents in this district have recently applied to change their names, claiming that family members mistakenly reported information during the investigation, or that they used their original names during the occupation. Now, in order to participate in public office elections, the names recorded in the household registration are different from the names on their qualifications certificates or the names they use daily. They are requesting changes. Regarding the use of names, the National Government promulgated the "Regulations on the Restriction of the Use of Names" in July of the 30th year of the Republic, which stipulates in the first article that "The real name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one. The name registered in the household registration is the real name. Those who use nicknames or other names shall indicate their real name." Can those who participate in the election use a nickname and indicate their real name according to the above regulations? This should be requested.</p>
<p>Can these applications to change names be instructed with 'investigation error' to correct the household registration booklet, or should they be processed in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the 'Regulations on Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames' promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on June 8th of the 22nd year of the Republic? This should be requested.</p>
<p>For those name changes that do not apply to the clauses of Article 2 of the 'Regulations on Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames,' should the procedures for changing names be carried out? This should be requested." The Municipal Government clarified the following three points:</p>
<h3>People Should Use Their Real Names in Principle</h3>
<p>(1) People should use their real names in principle. The third item of the first article of the Regulations on the Restriction of the Use of Names, which states that one should use a nickname and indicate their real name, is only an exception. The name of a public official who is elected must be consistent with the name on their qualification certificate and the name on the household registration book (refer to the Ministry of Interior's Order Yu Min Zi No. 2150 issued on April 17th of the 21st year of the Republic). Therefore, the name on the household registration book must be consistent with the name on the qualification certificate. If someone is elected using a nickname, even if they indicate their real name, it is difficult for it to take effect.</p>
<h3>Changing Names and Correcting Registration are Different</h3>
<p>(2) The change of name referred to in the Regulations on the Review and Approval of Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames by the Ministry of Interior refers to a situation where a person requests to change to another newly created name because their current name has one of the various circumstances listed in Article 2 of the regulations. It is not a correction registration as stipulated in the Household Registration Law, which is only a request for correction because the person believes that the name recorded on the household registration book is incorrect. Therefore, the aforementioned request to correct a name does not need to be processed in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Regulations on the Review and Approval of Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames. The person only needs to state the facts and attach supporting documents, and submit them to the district office in charge for correction. However, as a matter of caution, the district office should verify the documents attached after conducting an on-site investigation or review. In addition to correcting the household registration book in the district, the district office must also notify the police precinct and Bao Office in charge, and report it to the municipal government.</p>
<p>(3) If the district office encounters requests for name changes other than the above two situations and cannot make a decision, or if doubts arise regarding the supporting documents attached by the applicant, it should submit them to the municipal government for approval at any time.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Assists U.S. Authorities in Investigating Counterfeit U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>Three Types of Denominations Discovered; Businesses Must Seek Expert Authentication When Receiving</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, in addition to the previously discovered 20 and 50 dollar denominations, counterfeit 100 dollar bills have also been discovered. However, only a small amount has been discovered so far. This is the first time such a large denomination counterfeit bill has been discovered in China. The printing is extremely fine. The bill is stamped with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco seal. The letter "L" is printed on the upper left of the front, and the Arabic numeral "12" is printed in each corner. Among the counterfeit bills discovered, the number "F4" is printed on the lower right corner of the front, and the number "(32)" is printed on the back. The serial numbers of the counterfeit bills are generally around L00596908A. As for the counterfeit 20 dollar bills, the paper quality is rougher, and the printing is also inferior to the 100 dollar counterfeit bills. If the following numbers are found on the front and back of a 20 dollar bill, then the bill is undoubtedly counterfeit: C18-245 C19-249 D21-251 19-213 K17-210.</p>
<p>In response to a request from the U.S. Treasury Department's representative in China, the Central Bank has sent a circular to all banks and financial institutions in the city, stating that when receiving 20 and 50 dollar U.S. bills, they should carefully identify them and may submit them to the authentication experts sent by the U.S. government for identification. The addresses are: (1) Captain George Plotkin, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, New Asia Hotel, Sichuan North Road, telephone 19790, extension 47; (2) Lieutenant H.C. Millirem, U.S. Navy Pay Office, 28 Bund, telephone 15780, extension 233. Furthermore, all designated banks and Category A licensed businesses must remove the counterfeit bills after expert authentication confirms that they are counterfeit, mark them with a "Counterfeit" stamp, and submit them to the Central Bank at any time.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Slightly Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bonds rose slightly due to reports that the Legislative Yuan requested that the Ministry of Finance personally respond to the current bond market turmoil. People's confidence was restored, and buying picked up slightly. The "Tong Bing" bond initially rose from 720 yuan to 800 yuan before leveling off. As a result, it rose 90 yuan compared to last Saturday. The A and B bonds rose 60 yuan, the D bond rose 120 yuan, and the E bond also rose 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Sources Expand</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Water transport of coal has been from Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Keelung in Taiwan, and Vietnam and India. Now, the United States also has coal being transported to China. The William P. Gray Ship, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived with more than 9,000 tons of white coal from Pearl Harbor, to be unloaded in Qingdao. Because the ship's machinery was damaged, it came to Shanghai for repairs. It entered the Hefeng Shipyard yesterday and will sail to Qingdao to unload the coal once it is repaired. The British ship Yao Hao Parker, carrying more than 8,000 tons of white coal from Seattle, is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. This coal will also not be unloaded in this city and must hire a pilot to sail to Pukou to unload. It is said that both of the aforementioned shipments of coal are commercially operated. In addition, the Norwegian ship, Lant Sachs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with 6,040 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, and the British ship Alis Marle arrived with 5,400 tons of white coal chips from Vietnam for use in making coal balls.</p>
<p>Also, the Kailuan Coal Mine's daily output has reached 12,000 tons, but due to transportation issues, it cannot all be shipped to Shanghai. In order to meet Shanghai's coal needs, it has been decided to ship 10,000 tons of coal from Keelung, Taiwan, each month to make up the shortfall. The government has also ordered 80,000 to 100,000 tons of coal from Vietnam, which will be shipped to Shanghai in batches.</p>
<h3>More Than 40,000 Bags of Taiwan Sugar</h3>
<p>Arrived on the Taipei Ship</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A large quantity of Taiwan sugar has been shipped to Shanghai. The Taipei ship of the Taiwan Governor's Office, previously managed by China Merchants Bureau, is now managed by Antong Shipping Company at 220 Sichuan Road. The ship arrived in Shanghai from Keelung the day before yesterday (the 14th), carrying more than 40,000 bags of sugar, which were unloaded at the Huangpu Wharf. The ship needs to be repaired after the sugar is unloaded.</p>
<h3>Price Controls and Negotiated Prices: Laws to Be Changed</h3>
<p>Most of the laws and regulations formulated by the government during the war have now been abolished. However, because commodity price fluctuations have not yet ceased, the government has decided to retain all provisions of the "Regulations on the Control of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Times" and the "Measures for Suppressing the Hoarding of Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times" until the situation stabilizes. In addition, the Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to abolish the "Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices During Extraordinary Times." The Ministry is now preparing measures to abolish the price limit section. The negotiated price section will continue to be retained, but the standards for suppressing violations of negotiated prices will be appropriately relaxed.</p>
<h3>All Factions Compete to Purchase: Yarn Market Stays Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was quite buoyant. The Cantonese faction increased their purchases, and the Hankou faction also arrived. Customers from Beijing and Wuhu also made considerable purchases of small and medium-sized yarns. As a result, all 20-count yarns were showing a prosperous trend. The "Ma" yarn saw the largest increase, rising six to seven thousand yuan higher than last weekend. The rest rose by about two to three thousand yuan. The market was exceptionally strong. Fine yarns and threads saw little activity, and sales remained sluggish. At noon, the China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual. The prices were one to six thousand yuan lower than the previous auction. In addition, there were nine types of coarse and fine yarns and threads, which were sold in two groups by tender.</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Are Smooth: Trading in local cotton is quite brisk, and market prices remain firm. Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 200 bales of Uruguay cotton, Defeng Factory purchased 500 bales of Pengjiapo cotton, and Dasheng purchased 200 bales of Pengjiapo cotton. In addition, cotton firms also traded five to six hundred bales, with prices up one to two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Is Sluggish: The actual demand for cotton cloth is quiet. Only Sichuan, Guangdong, Hankou, Hangzhou, and other places have some demand for fine cloth and serge. Other sales channels are not smooth.</p>
<h3>China Textile's Current Production</h3>
<p>More Than 900 Pieces of Yarn Produced Daily; More Than 20,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth Produced Daily</p>
<p>Regarding reports that the China Textile Company's production has sharply decreased due to power restrictions, according to the company's business department, the China Textile Company's entire production increase plan is being gradually promoted. In addition to the domestic market, it is also planned to expand to the South Seas Islands. The recent reduction in production is due to power supply issues. Because some boilers at the power company have been damaged, the power generation is slightly limited. According to news from the power company, the company has ordered generators from the United States that can generate 24,000 kilowatts, which will arrive in the short term. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company is also expected to increase power generation by 8,000 kilowatts starting next month. Therefore, the power supply issue will definitely be resolved at that time. As for the China Textile Company's current production, according to the person in charge, the current daily output of yarn is more than 900 pieces, and the output of cotton cloth is about 20,000 bolts.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Peaceful, U.S. Dollar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The crude gold market opened slightly higher yesterday morning, and people's sentiment was still good. Silver shops made slight purchases, and the high price was 1.97 million yuan. After the U.S. dollar was resold, it weakened, and the gold market's upward trend temporarily came to an end. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 85 taels, priced at 1.9575 million yuan, and then it became more peaceful. Around noon, it was still hovering between 1.95 million and 1.96 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to be dragged down by the U.S. dollar to around 1.945 million yuan. As a result, it closed 17,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Decorative gold was 10,800 yuan, silver was 1,800 yuan, and silver dollars were sold at 1,380 yuan. The informal money market remained loose, with interest rates at 1.5 to 1.8 jiao.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar continued to decline, as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Anglo-American loan bill. Buyers turned to Hong Kong dollars. Sellers offered, and from the opening price of 2,560 yuan, it fell steadily. At noon, it had broken through the 2,500 yuan mark. In the afternoon, it continued to fall, and the result was another 70 yuan lower than last Saturday. The exchange rate for the British pound rose to 3 yuan and 7 jiao. The gold arbitrage also widened to 784 yuan per 10 taels. Hong Kong currency continued to advance, reaching a high price of 580 yuan before slightly retreating. The result was another 5 yuan higher. The exchange rate for Hong Kong was 560 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 690 yuan, British exchange rate was 9,200 yuan, and all were being sold. The U.S. exchange rate remained flat.</p>
<h3>Consumer Cooperatives Self-Manage Rice Distribution</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Yuan Cheaper Per Stone</p>
<p>Mr. Li Wan-chung, Chairman of the Shanghai Consumer Cooperative, has recently been issued a purchasing certificate by the Social Affairs Bureau. He has sent personnel to various rice-producing areas to purchase and transport large quantities of rice, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. All members of the cooperative, regardless of when they joined, can be allocated at least one stone per household unit. Based on the actual cost, each stone will be more than 10,000 yuan cheaper than the market price in Shanghai. It is said that the cooperative also directly accepts commissions from schools, factories, organizations, and other cooperatives for group purchases to serve the citizens.</p>
<h3>Prices Rise to 35 Cents: Not Many U.S. Cotton Orders</h3>
<p>According to cotton industry authorities, since the U.S. government lifted price controls on goods, the price of U.S. cotton has risen. Previously, orders were about 30 U.S. cents per pound, but now it is 35 cents. In recent months, orders for U.S. cotton from the industry have been more relaxed than before. The reason is that the U.S. cotton loan of 33 million U.S. dollars has little remaining. In addition, Shanghai's various firms and cotton mills estimate that U.S. cotton inventories can last until February of the following year. The recent arrivals of U.S. cotton are all previous orders.</p>
<h3>Warehouse Greed Opposed by Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Association believes that foreign merchant warehouses repeatedly make unreasonable demands, and warehouse rents are also increasing from time to time. For example, the current warehouse rent for a bale of U.S. cotton is 1.10 U.S. dollars, which is calculated on a monthly basis, but there is a possibility of an increase in the middle. When picking up goods, there are fees for opening doors and turning over goods. If the U.S. cotton to be picked up is on the bottom layer, the U.S. cotton stacked on top must be turned over first. It is said that the fee per bale is 2,000 yuan. People in the cotton industry say that these unnecessary losses are unbearable. Therefore, the association is currently discussing negotiations with foreign merchant warehouses.</p>
<h3>Tea Companies Hasten to Purchase High-Grade Gunpowder Tea; Ningzhou Flower-Scented Tea Nearly Sold Out</h3>
<p>Regarding the high-grade Gunpowder green tea that is mainly sold overseas, tea companies are frequently inquiring about old stocks. Substantial purchases are already underway, awaiting export opportunities. As for flower-scented tea for domestic sales, Ningzhou flower-scented tea from Yixing has been selling briskly for days, with strong purchasing demand. However, due to dwindling inventories, further trade cannot be initiated. The sales of other teas at stores and shops on this street are quite good, especially Taiwanese black tea and Xinshao fried tea. However, prices have not increased.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the timber market, fir prices remained stable due to a balance between sales volume and incoming supply. Although there was some arrival of foreign pine, orders from foreign firms have decreased recently, making it difficult for prices to recover. There were reports of Lauan arriving, and prices softened slightly.</p>
<h3>National Medicines Improve</h3>
<p>The trade in national medicines has been quiet for a long time. Recently, large amounts of Guangbi currency have been used for transactions, with demand for stomach medicines remaining robust. Moreover, merchants from Taiwan continue to show interest, adding a noticeable boost to the market. Consequently, most goods have improved in price, particularly mountain products, which are especially strong.</p>
<h3>US Silver Price May Increase; Senate and House Seek Compromise; Silver Reserves Exceed 220 Million Ounces</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Wall Street Journal reported that the Senate, on Saturday, rejected the proposal to fix the silver price at $0.7111 per ounce by a vote of 54 to 25. It is believed that the Senate may seek a compromise with the House of Representatives and pass the Senate's proposed $0.905 per ounce. The House of Representatives initially expressed surprise at the Senate's rejection of its proposal and was unwilling to compromise. However, due to the intention of leaders from both the majority and minority parties to compromise, the matter may succeed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The US Treasury Department holds nearly 225,000,000 ounces of silver, far exceeding the amount needed for currency reserves. However, American industry still feels a shortage of silver because US law prohibits the Treasury Department from selling silver to industry. Senators and representatives from Western silver-producing states are demanding that the Treasury Department set the silver price at $0.903 per ounce, increasing to $1.29 per ounce after two years, compared to the current silver price of $0.712 per ounce.</p>
<h3>US Lacks Virgin Antimony; London Prices Higher</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] Traders here believe that the current US antimony price of $0.158 per pound will soon rise rapidly. It is said that the US has a great need for antimony ore, but imports are not very enthusiastic because the London antimony price has reached £125 per ton (approximately US $0.23 per pound), which is much higher than the US market price. According to official statistics, the US needs 24,000 tons of antimony in 1945, but domestic supply only accounts for about 10%. Chinese official reports indicate that China's antimony reserves reach 2,500,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Plentiful Supply and Widespread Distribution; Rice Market Situation Stable; Rice Shops Ordered to Limit Retail Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all rice shops in the city received notifications from the Rice Shop Commercial Guild, stating that for retail sales, each person is limited to a maximum of five dou (approximately 2.5 pecks) per purchase. If rice shops do not issue invoices when selling, they must record the name, address, date, and quantity purchased of the buyer in their ledgers for inspection at any time. The total registered amount of rice arriving at the North and South rice markets yesterday was 5,311 shi (approximately 28,450 bushels). Rice shops transported and sold 150 bags themselves, plus 1,439 shi (approximately 7,690 bushels). Market conditions showed mixed trends of increases, decreases, and stability. Baiyuan rice showed slight vitality, while other types lacked momentum for price increases. The allocated sale of coarse Xian rice covered a total of twenty-six districts. Rice prices in Nanxiang and Zhoupu near the suburbs fell by five to six thousand yuan. Flour prices fluctuated. Bran prices rose by one thousand yuan. Broad bean demand was stagnant, falling by approximately one thousand yuan. Bean cake for fertilizer was in high demand, increasing by another five to six hundred yuan. Raw peanuts remained stable. The supply of oil was slightly scarce, and shop demand was active, with prices rising by two thousand yuan. There were inquiries about wheat from Shantou, and sellers were firm, raising prices by one thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Mr. Shen Zhennan Discusses the Sugarcane Conference</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Zhennan, General Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, recently went to Taiwan to attend the All-Taiwan Sugarcane Industry Conference. It is said that the most important decision made at the conference was the "Sugar Distribution Method." In the past, during the Japanese era, sugar manufacturing companies determined raw material prices, which were approved by the Governor-General, and purchases from sugarcane farmers were made accordingly. This method is no longer applicable in the current period of unstable prices. Therefore, a new method had to be adopted. The principle is that the sugar company and sugarcane farmers cooperate, with a ratio of 52% of the produced sugar going to the company and 48% to the farmers. A Sugar Price Review Committee will be established by the Chief Executive Office, composed of thirteen members selected from the various units attending the Sugarcane Conference. The committee will use the monthly sugar prices from December to April of the following year as a standard and hold an evaluation meeting once a month. The company will use this standard to calculate purchases of sugarcane from farmers. This method has been approved and implemented by Chief Executive Chen. The second important issue is expanding the sugarcane planting area, possibly promoting the planting of nine jia (each jia is equivalent to sixteen mu) between July and September. It is estimated that there may be a production of 300,000 tons of sugar in the year after next. Mr. Shen continued that the conference also decided on two schemes to assist sugarcane farmers: (1) providing loans to sugarcane farmers, as farmers need substantial funds to purchase sugarcane seedlings and cultivate the land; a loan program will be established with the Bank of Taiwan; (2) applying fertilizer, which requires approximately 50,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. As it is difficult to purchase this amount immediately, it was decided to purchase various fertilizers such as soybean cake and peanut cake as substitutes.</p>
<p>(Additional News) The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is scheduled to continue its sixth allocation of medium-grade sugar today. All sugar industry members have been notified to apply for the required quantities for each unit as usual.</p>
<h3>Following the Announcement of Listing Rules, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks saw short covering, and buyers took the opportunity to push prices higher, resulting in continuous gains. At the peak, Yongsheng Textile reached 525 yuan, Mei Asia 3280 yuan, Jingfu 208 yuan, Xinguang 225 yuan, and Qinxing 182 yuan. Around noon, there was some profit-taking, causing a slight pullback from the highs. Less popular but more solid stocks continued to be accumulated, showing good momentum. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng Textile rose slightly, Mei Asia increased by half a percent, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing experienced small rallies. Due to the stock exchange's listing rules not being considered too strict, each rose by 10% to 15%. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks continued to rise, while old stocks remained stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw buying activity triggered by reports that foreign companies registered under Chinese company law could also apply for listing under the stock listing rules. Yisha rose from 8100 to 8500 yuan, and British Alliance from 8200 to 8700 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, large stocks such as Yisha, British Alliance, and Jardine Matheson rose by 10%, while smaller stocks rose by 0.5% to 1%.</p>
<h3>Mexican Gold Prices Higher Than US</h3>

<h3>Rescuing Northern Jiangsu Refugees; Eight Years of War Could Be Endured; One Day of Struggle is Truly Unbearable</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent He Xianglin</p>
<p>This newspaper reported from Yangzhou on the 2nd:</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is a vital part of Jiangsu Province and a crucial part of China. It has a population of eighteen million, vast fertile agricultural lands, and significant production. However, since the "August 15th" Japanese surrender, except for Yangzhou, Taizhou, Nantong, and Xuhai, most areas have been successively captured by the Communist Party. Disregarding the nation and the people's lives, they implemented the "Three Capital" Struggle and the "Three Alls" Policy, struggling until everything was destroyed and slaughtering until people were killed. Young and strong men were conscripted into their militia. For the past ten months, the people of Northern Jiangsu, who were occupied, including men, women, old, and young, have been fleeing in droves due to unbearable oppression and the inability to survive, abandoning their beloved homes and becoming refugees along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) railway line in Yangzhou and Southern Jiangsu. They are not only crying out for food but also enduring the elements, living an inhuman existence. I have heard many refugees lamenting, "Eight years of war were easier to endure; one day of struggle is truly unbearable." How can we not express sympathy and provide rescue for such a tragic cry?</p>
<p>Rescue Work is Busy Day and Night</p>
<p>This heartbreaking displacement has aroused great concern from our central authorities. Last month, the National Government specially appointed Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs to oversee the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief effort and established a Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference in Zhenjiang. After days of planning by Minister Gu and Chairman Wang, five offices were established in Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Xuzhou, and Haizhou under this powerful organization, each responsible for a specific aspect of the relief work.</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Office was officially established on June 20th. According to Xie Zhigang, the director of the office, Zhang Xiji, the deputy director, is the station chief of the Yangzhou Social Relief Center. Another deputy director is Li Weisun, the leader of the Yangzhou work team of the Su-Ning Sub-Administration. They were both appointed to serve concurrently as deputy directors, assisting in the work. The Ministry of Social Affairs has sent only two people, Huang Deming and Fan Peng, to serve as supervisors. In addition, three staff members, including clerks and accountants, were transferred from local government agencies to work without pay. It is admirable that these few people are able to undertake such a significant task. Under the leadership of Director Xie, they put forward an eight-character slogan: "No holidays, no set office hours." Under this slogan, everyone is working day and night, spending almost all their time at their desks except for eating and sleeping. As a result, their work efficiency is relatively rapid. At the same time, in addition to the office organization, they also established a joint relief work meeting system, inviting the heads of relevant local agencies and people engaged in relief work to participate in the meetings, which are held every Sunday to report on the work situation, review it, and promote progress. As a result, some difficulties in the relief work have been reduced. In addition, a Supervisory Committee was established, with the local garrison commander, Commander Huang Baitao, as the chairman and Commissioner Lin as the vice-chairman. Other members include local dignitaries and heads of relevant agencies. By placing the supervisory power outside the executive power of the office, it further demonstrates its openness and has gained the sympathy of more people, which is a great and powerful help to the relief work.</p>
<p>"Liberated" Without Clothing or Food</p>
<p>What is the situation of the refugees in Yangzhou? Let me give you a detailed report. Since the Communist Party implemented "liberation" in Northern Jiangsu, they have "liberated" the people of Northern Jiangsu to the point of being "without clothing, food, or shelter." They have been fleeing to Yangzhou with their children, including people from Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Yancheng, Taixian, Huaiyin, Funing, Huaian, Suqian, Lianshui, Siyang, and Jiangdu and surrounding districts. The total number of refugees, after three registrations, was 8,357 people in the first registration last December. In the second registration this March, another 8,211 people were added. The third registration was recently conducted, with the number reaching 31,599 people. The total number of people registered in the three instances is 48,167. All these people are gathered in the city of Yangzhou, crying out for food. The exiled county governments and the Sixth and Seventh District Commissioner's Offices have all established offices in Yangzhou. The county magistrates, secretaries of the county party committees, and secretaries of the Youth League are all enthusiastically gathering exiled people from each county in Yangzhou to form post-disaster relief associations to be responsible for registering and investigating the refugees. In addition, people from each county residing in other places have formed native place associations to take charge of the matter. There are a total of twenty-three such relief organizations in Yangzhou. These twenty-three relief units, recognizing that refugees are still sleeping in the open without shelter and urgently need to be accommodated, initiated the establishment of reception centers. A total of nineteen reception centers have been established in empty houses or temples in the city. Recently, another one has been added, bringing the total to twenty. The total number of refugees in the reception centers is 2,730. The refugees living in these places include university graduates, lawyers, and primary and secondary school teachers, all sleeping on the ground without any possessions other than the clothes on their backs, a situation that is extremely miserable and indescribable. When Minister Gu and Chairman Wang inspected the refugee reception centers, they shouted "Our saviors have come," and knelt down to Minister Gu and Chairman Wang with tears in their eyes. If they still had a ray of hope, who would be willing to beg like this? Who gave them this? "The communist army of mob rule"!</p>
<p>Accommodating Youth and Reassuring Refugees</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's going on with exiled youth and students. There are quite a few exiled young people in Yangzhou. The Youth League has set up four youth reception centers, accommodating more than 800 young people. There are more than 1,500 people who have registered but have not yet been admitted. In addition, there is a continuing education class for exiled students established by the Ministry of Education, which also accommodates 410 students. The funding for the youth reception center was specially provided by Chairman Wang and is currently sustainable. If the government does not find a way to provide funding in the future, it may be difficult to sustain. In addition to attending classes and drills, young people also assist in investigating and registering refugee work. How lovely.</p>
<p>Distributing Emergency Relief and Setting Standards</p>
<p>According to Director Xie, "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire." Sure enough, their work is also in full swing. The original allocation of relief funds for Yangzhou was 100 million yuan, which was decided by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference to be used for relief projects. After inspecting the situation, Minister Gu and Chairman Wang believed that it was necessary to issue emergency relief and temporarily changed their minds to withdraw a portion of the relief funds to issue emergency relief. The Yangzhou Office has now formulated the following standards for distribution: (1) Elderly people over the age of 60; (2) Infants under the age of one and their mothers; (3) Those who are currently unable to make a living due to illness; (4) Those who are disabled and unable to make a living; (5) Housewives with two or more minor children who are unable to make a living as a result; (6) Unmarried women over the age of fourteen who are unable to work or support themselves; (7) Family members of active servicemen and survivors of anti-Japanese war casualties who are exiled and destitute and hold supporting documents; (8) Pregnant women who are about to give birth and are unable to work; (9) Impoverished children under the age of twelve.</p>
<p>Rapid Registration. More than ten of the twenty-three units have submitted their lists, and distribution will begin as soon as they are checked. The census lists are submitted by the Bao Chiefs, and more than 250 exiled youths are assisting in the work, which can be completed in two days, which is particularly fast. In order to ensure that refugees truly receive practical benefits, separate investigations are still needed. It is estimated that there are a total of 264 Bao in Yangzhou. If more personnel are dispatched, it may be completed within a week. There are also some refugees living with many relatives and friends because they did not report that they were refugees when they reported their household registration. Now, individuals have applied to the office for registration. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the office has sent personnel to conduct a review of the household registration with the county government and inquire in detail.</p>
<p>Improving the Method of Receiving Refugees</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the refugee reception centers, the Yangzhou Office has now formulated the following measures: The main points are to repair houses that cannot provide shelter from wind and rain, provide straw mats to those who do not have them, and set up public water tanks and conduct drinking water disinfection. Each reception center has an isolation room and one or two bathtubs depending on the number of people. Budget estimates are currently being prepared separately. Environmental sanitation is also being actively addressed. Liu Yong, a technician from the Health Department, is distributing DDT powder separately. The refugees feel quite comforted under these circumstances. In addition, the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank is actively conducting small loans. According to the report of the manager of the Agricultural Bank at the first joint meeting of the Yangzhou Office, there were 27 households in one day. Although this number is too small, it is because the general refugees are not yet clear about the loan situation, and the office is intensifying publicity. This is an overview of their rescue work, which is also their performance within a short period of ten days. Here, we would like to quote two sentences. Chairman Wang said to the refugees: "The Communist army wants you to be uneasy; I want you to be at ease. The Communist army tells you to have no food; I want you all to have food." What is said above is the "Way to Reassure the People."</p>
<p>Garrison Troops Practice Righteousness by Fasting for One Day</p>
<p>In addition to the government-sponsored relief work in Yangzhou, Garrison Commander Huang Baitao also launched a campaign for all officers and soldiers of the division to fast for one day to distribute emergency relief, giving each large household 1,800 yuan and each small household 900 yuan, and giving each large household 3.5 jin (approximately 4.6 pounds) of rice and each small household 2 jin (approximately 2.6 pounds) of rice. The number of people receiving relief reached 4,800, all of whom were extremely poor and in need of emergency relief. To this day, they are still singing praises of General Huang's kindness. The most fortunate refugees received flour specially issued by General Gu Zhutong.</p>
<p>It seems that there are no problems for the refugees, but unexpectedly, problems continue to arise. In the Eighth and Ninth Districts of Jiangdu County, people have been fleeing to the area near Sutu Temple and Phoenix Bridge in Jiangdu County due to oppression and persecution by the Communist army, with approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people, including county councilors, secondary school teachers, lawyers, and foreign missionaries. After receiving the news, the Yangzhou Office immediately contacted the local government agencies and sent people to rescue them. However, when they arrived at Phoenix Bridge, they only saw hundreds of people because the Communist army saw that most of the people had left their "liberated area" and spread rumors that the government's registration of refugees and such kindness was not well-intentioned and wanted to use the refugees to form a strong army. Under this rumor offensive, the refugees who had fled scattered again. It is heartbreaking! We do not know how these refugees will live a life of pain in the future. We care! We sympathize! We remember……!</p>

<h3>A Hospital Should Be Established Quickly in Fahuazhen</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I live in Fahuazhen in western Shanghai, where most residents are poor. There have been many cholera cases recently. Today, walking in the town from west to east, I saw lime and ash circles outside of every dozen or so houses, which are clearly signs that someone has died. In the afternoon, several people in the neighboring house also had cholera. They have not received an education, so they are asking scrape-down practitioners for treatment, which will surely lead to mistakes. In previous years, local charitable organizations would come to our town every summer to set up free hospitals, benefiting many poor people. As the epidemic is increasing day by day, it would be best if the health authorities could set up a temporary charitable hospital, which is truly necessary for public safety. (Resident Qin Shang)</p>
<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>Dear Sir: I have read the article "Extra Fees for Primary School Graduation" in the Reader's Opinion section of your newspaper on the 6th, which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, it was found that the graduating students of the sixth grade of our school voluntarily initiated a class meeting because graduation was approaching, and each person paid 10,000 yuan to prepare for taking photos and hosting a tea party, which was agreed upon by the class leader and the class teacher. The school believes that it is reasonable for students to take graduation photos and hold farewell parties for commemorative purposes, so it did not interfere. We hereby declare a correction. Sincerely, Peijie Elementary School.</p>

<h3>The Abstract Nature of Music</h3>
<p>— Liang Youting</p>
<p>Music is an art form that is intangible and invisible, possessing an elusive abstract quality. Yet, many people, upon hearing a piece of music, invariably ask, "What does it mean?" If this question were posed to a poet or a literary figure, they might craft an answer that is exceptionally beautiful in its deception. However, if asked of someone who truly understands music, they would find it difficult to reply. When Beethoven played the piano, friends would often ask him, "What does this mean?" Beethoven would definitively say, "It means exactly this!"—this is the most honest answer.</p>
<p>Of course, conceptualizing music is a demand of human reason; imbuing rich melodies with rich poetry, and pairing grand poetry with grand melodies and harmonies are all perfectly acceptable. But art, to some extent, possesses "transcendence" and an inexplicable quality; if one insists on making it too realistic, it becomes extremely vulgar. For example, the sounds of a rooster crowing or a dog barking, if depicted realistically using musical instruments, feel unbearably vulgar. If the sounds of chickens and dogs were to be played in an orchestra, one might as well perform ventriloquism—why bother with music? Not long ago, a harmonica band performed in Nanjing, and one of their pieces was a "descriptive music" piece, where the sound of a rooster crowing was created using ventriloquism, resulting in laughter from the audience and completely disrupting the musical atmosphere. Therefore, "descriptive music" is essentially a game, and is not favored by serious musicians. Someone aptly said: "The highest form of art should use the most economical materials and the most suggestive methods to express something inconceivable." I believe this can also be compared to painting! When a painting is rendered too realistically, it often makes people think: why not just take a photograph, instead of painstakingly painting it? (I am not knowledgeable about art, so I don't know if this analogy is accurate).</p>
<p>"Flowers are not flowers, fog is not fog; they come at midnight, and depart at dawn; coming like a brief spring dream, and vanishing like morning clouds, leaving no trace!" This poem by Bai Juyi was set to music in D major by Mr. Huang Zi, and was included as teaching material in the Commercial Press's "Music" textbook. Students who sang it often asked: "Teacher, what does this actually mean?" Then the teacher could only copy Beethoven and answer: "It means exactly this"—this example can also help illustrate the abstract nature of music.</p>
<p>Music can only be understood with emotions; rendering it too realistic makes it feel forced and vulgar.</p>
<h3>Homesickness Through Paintings</h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>Guangxi is my hometown. Since fleeing to escape the war, I haven't been back for three years. I think about it all the time: the surviving villages after the calamity and the simple, hardworking, and kind people who have suffered. But in these past few years, from letters from home and letters from fellow villagers, I still cannot clearly understand the situation of my hometown, because their letters often carry some comforting understatement, lightly passing over the tragic destruction and painful disasters, as if comforting a child, telling them not to grieve over what has been lost, but to strive for future reconstruction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to see Mr. Situ Qiao's sketches of disaster conditions. I felt like I had returned to my hometown and taken a walk, personally witnessing the homes reduced to rubble and the people starving and dying.</p>
<p>Guilin, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Weirong, Yangshuo, Quanzhou—I have been to all these places, and deep memories remain in my mind. I personally watched the construction of the Zhongzheng Bridge on the Li River and the Weirong Bridge, and even chatted with the workers driving the piles. These projects, almost built with the blood and flesh of the people, now lie broken and dismembered before my eyes.</p>
<p>The refugees, the starving people, the fleeing people, fathers and daughters, boat women, and old men in the paintings—I am familiar with them all, as if I have met my own family. The old people have had their life's energy drained by years of labor, yet they have no rest and will never even think of resting, except when death claims their vitality. The young children carry the worries of forty- or fifty-year-old adults in their small hearts, worrying about the family's livelihood. These are common occurrences in our hometown, but when I looked at the painting "Father and Daughter" for a long time, I could not suppress the bitter tears that flowed down silently. They are like my family. I sympathize with and pity them. I cannot bear to see their eyes, already dulled and white from the oppression of heavy disasters. People should not have such expressions and suffer such persecution!</p>
<p>Lijiang Spring Clarity, Yangshuo Painted Mountains, Yangshuo Rain, and Early Spring Misty Rain Crossing the Flower Bridge—these are places where I used to linger. On the banks of the Li River, watching the drizzling rain fall on the river scenery, if it were a clear spring day, the undulating low mountains would resemble the strange backs of animals, remotely lying in the rain-covered peaks, the mountains draped with strips of white clouds condensed with moisture. These scenes can be fully enjoyed simply by standing on the Zhongzheng Bridge. The Flower Bridge, Seven Star Cave, Crescent Mountain... on the opposite bank of the city, have now become ruined waters and broken mountains in the painter's brush! Mr. Situ Qiao wrote on his painting Early Spring Misty Rain Crossing the Flower Bridge, that he was unable to fully capture the essence. Mr. Situ Qiao, in order to leave an unforgettable memory and lesson of the disaster for the people forever, naturally could not leisurely engage in "xieyi" (freehand) painting like other painters. His brush was dipped in tears. Today, even if there are places where "the beautiful rivers and mountains remain intact," they carry a desolate and tragic color!</p>
<p>Rebuilding Wuzhou, Bombed and Rebuilt—these paintings are some messages of rebirth that the painter has reported to his hometown through a painful brush. However, in the current chaotic situation, these weak new forces should be given greater assistance. Otherwise, it will be like "patching a thatched hut," and how much practical benefit will the people receive?</p>
<p>Homesickness through paintings—this kind of emotion is a boundless and sour taste, like the song written by Mr. Situ Qiao's wife, Yi Mei, about the boat woman: "Clear shakes the moon, rain shakes the wind, day shakes sorrow, night shakes dreams, cannot shake off hunger and cold, cannot shake off poverty, rice prices are painfully high, taxes are painfully heavy!" The strand of homesickness that arises is like an oar, constantly shaking, shaking. I wonder when it will be quiet?</p>
<p>As I was about to walk out of the exhibition hall, I turned back to look at the oil painting "Put Down Your Whip," seeing the Fengyang girl, her tears rolling down. Thinking that I was originally also a singer of "Fengyang Drums," shivering, I turned around and hurried downstairs.</p>
<p>On the way back, I was thinking about the last painting in the Refugee Pictures, the disabled old man lying down, who said well, looking at his seven or eight children and grandchildren lying on the ground: "We have suffered, and that's that, but we should not let this group of future masters of the country suffer for another generation!" These are painful words, and also the last words I want to say in my homesick heart.</p>

<h3>Staying Together as a Pair, Chapter Eighty-Six</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After Lihua recovered, she immediately wanted to leave Xuzhou, and with the war spreading towards Xuzhou, Zhang Xian also made plans to move further south. But in order to scrape together some travel expenses, Zhang Xian asked Lihua to sing three more farewell commemorative performances. Lihua refused, driving Zhang Xian to almost kowtow to her. In the end, Lihua had no choice but to sing for three more days.</p>
<p>Next, Lihua wandered to Kaifeng. This time, Lihua declared to Mrs. Mo in advance: besides singing, she would not socialize. Mrs. Mo, learning from her last experience in Xuzhou, was unwilling to force Lihua again. All interpersonal matters were handled by Zhang Xian alone. The local customs in Kaifeng had the solemnity and righteousness of Beijing, and were relatively simple and honest. Therefore, they soon settled down.</p>
<p>In Kaifeng, Lihua's mood was very calm; she was able to continue reading and quietly live her own life. She quickly became accustomed to this new environment, and she quite liked this simple ancient city. She lived on Huang Da Wang Temple Gate Street in the north of the city, only a stone's throw from Huang Da Wang Temple. Inside Huang Da Wang Temple was now a private girls' middle school. This aroused Lihua's strong interest. Every day she saw groups of female students coming out of the school in groups of three or five, carrying their schoolbags and chatting happily, which made her extremely envious! She often thought: if she could be with these girls; if she could go to this school to study every day, oh God! How happy would she be! She regarded these female students as the favored children of heaven; as the high and mighty, red and bright stars!</p>
<p>Because Lihua admired the girls' school so much, she constantly took Liyun with her during the students' class time, sneaking in and hiding under the window outside a classroom, eavesdropping on the lectures inside. Liyun became impatient and slipped away to play on her own. The school's sports field became the place she was most interested in. As soon as the students were dismissed from class, Lihua quickly went out with Liyun. Later, she not only eavesdropped, but also took a small notebook to secretly record what was being taught. From this, she gained a lot of new knowledge.</p>

<h3>Investigation (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Fu</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, but people no longer called Old Yao "Old Man," but instead called him "Lord Yao." Old Yao himself couldn't quite understand whether people were respecting him or looking down on him. However, according to what he told others, based on his recent appointment as the director of the third branch of the Salt Affairs Bureau in this county, people calling him "Lord Yao" was entirely a way of expressing their utmost respect for him, and he speculated that this title even contained a bit of flattery. Therefore, Old Yao was very proud. Whenever he met old colleagues from his days in education, he would invariably say:</p>
<p>"Friends calling me Lord Yao is truly undeserved, but managing salt affairs is something I did over a decade ago. Teaching was just something I did when I had no other choice. Teaching was indeed a hard life, neither filling your stomach nor letting you starve. Old Yao has experienced that for a few years... Luckily, I've finally escaped and am now managing salt affairs... This time, I have to do a good job. In short, Old Yao doesn't want money, so I'm not afraid of not doing well. I'll eventually show you all something..."</p>
<p>Old Yao was indeed quite loyal to his old friends. For example, he helped promote two colleagues from the education field who were always on good terms with him, arranging positions for them in his office. One was appointed as a secretary, and the other as the chief inspector.</p>
<p>"Who else should I use but my own old friends?" Old Yao would often say with great seriousness to a group of friends he had called in, "But doing this job in public service, it's not difficult, but really very difficult. It's difficult, but really not that difficult. I did it for six or seven years before, and I only ended up as a clerk, so I didn't make much money. But that's because I didn't want money! If you want to be upright, don't earn dirty money. That's what I like to do. Like those money-grubbing guys who specialize in smuggling, making a little money and then bribing their superiors to get promoted. So, they always get promoted. But even if they become directors, so what? How ugly! I'm someone who's honest and upright, always handling public affairs cleanly... Until now, I'm still penniless, but I've still managed to become a director. And I'm not bragging, but my position as director was offered to me by my old superior because he knew that Old Yao doesn't want money and handles public affairs cleanly..."</p>
<p>Only Old Yao himself knew whether he handled public affairs as cleanly as he claimed. But it was a fact that his life had gradually become more prosperous since he became a director. Just look at his residence; he had moved from a low and humble bungalow to a magnificent mansion. As for clothing, he had switched from old and unsightly cloth gowns to brand-new woolen garments. As for transportation, he had a chartered car at his disposal, and he even hired a nanny for his home. Naturally, people saw that Old Yao's life had become so prosperous, and they could somewhat figure him out. But whenever Old Yao met friends or acquaintances, he would obediently make up a few sentences:</p>
<p>"Managing salt affairs is quite difficult. There's no funding, no housing. Recently, the bureau finally took over a house, and I was able to temporarily borrow it to live in. But it's too far from the office, so I asked someone to borrow an old car for me to get around. In short, it's all for public use. We people who work in public service must do everything 'for the public'... In short, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one?"</p>
<p>Old Yao was indeed afraid of no one. He felt that he didn't need to be afraid of anyone. With his old experience and old tricks, he could keep doing what he was doing without anyone knowing or noticing. Who would he be afraid of?</p>
<p>Day after day passed, and Old Yao continued to do what he was doing...</p>
<p>Before long, things went wrong. There was a record of this in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, the county police received a tip and seized a large amount of smuggled salt at the port, and apprehended several smugglers. It is said that this case is significantly related to the third branch of the Salt Affairs Bureau in XX district of this county."</p>
<p>The case was exposed, and things had blown up. The office staff told Old Yao the news. Old Yao was shocked, but after all, he was an old fox. He put on a practiced look of calm:</p>
<p>"Old Yao would never engage in smuggling. Such rumors are inevitable. Managing salt affairs is just difficult... Fortunately, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one?"</p>
<p>Two days later, the county police station sent two policemen with an official letter and a subpoena to find Old Yao. The official letter said:</p>
<p>"...We hope that your bureau will assist in the investigation of this case... Yao XX, the director of the third branch, is bold and reckless and should be strictly investigated..."</p>
<p>Old Yao was shocked to see the official letter from the general bureau, but he still couldn't help but pretend to be nonchalant, humming to himself, "Old Yao would never engage in smuggling. I'll go if I have to. Anyway, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one..."</p>

<h3>How to Keep My Child Healthy</h3>
<p>— By Yan Fang</p>
<p>I am a mother of three children. I breastfed all of my children myself, and even with all the care, money, energy, and time I spent, they still inevitably got sick sometimes. However, in terms of development, they seem to have reached the standard level. I will share my nine years of experience with mothers who care about their children:</p>
<p>(1) From birth to ten years old, it is difficult for a child to avoid illness, but the diseases vary in each period—</p>
<p>A. Breastfed infants are less likely to get sick within six months because they have less contact with the outside world and spend their days eating and sleeping. Therefore, most babies are chubby before weaning. However, once weaned, they gradually become thinner and show signs of weakness. Colds, coughs, and pneumonia are more likely to occur. Inflammation of the lymph nodes is also most common shortly after weaning. To prevent this, pay attention to the baby's diet and hygiene after six months. In addition to milk, various foods must be added, such as vegetables and eggs, to accustom their stomachs to various foods. A new food can be added every month or every half month, and it must be nutritious and easily digestible. Start with very small portions and gradually increase them. Then, once weaned, their bodies will not be affected and they can maintain the chubbiness and health they had when breastfeeding.</p>
<p>B. One to three years old is the most annoying and troublesome time. They are prone to eating bad things, catching a cold, getting a cold, swallowing dangerous items by mistake, and falling from tables and cabinets. During this period, pay attention to digestion and nutrition in their food. They should not go out or enter public places on weekdays (except parks). If no one can watch them at all times, at least provide them with a safe environment, such as using wooden fences or tables and chairs to surround them, allowing them to crawl, play, walk, and jump on the ground.</p>
<p>C. From three to five years old, they gradually become sensible and can play with wooden cars, etc. alone. Absolutely do not allow them to eat things they cannot eat. Many habits are already obvious during this period, so you must pay close attention to their actions. Sometimes, a little punishment can be quite effective. A healthy child can control their clothing and actions during this period. If you pay special attention to their diet and be careful about the temperature, they will not easily get sick.</p>
<p>D. From five to ten years old, they spend most of their time at school. During this time, they have more contact with the outside world and are more likely to contract various diseases. Therefore, seasonal vaccinations and cowpox, etc., must not be neglected or delayed.</p>
<p>(2) Things to pay attention to every day—</p>
<p>A. Are bowel movements normal? Children must have regular bowel movements every day and urinate frequently. If the stool is white and abnormal, it must be indigestion. The easiest way is to reduce their food intake and drink more boiled water. If there are suspicious sticky substances, they may have diarrhea and must be treated by a doctor.</p>
<p>B. Sudden irritability, anxiety, or restless sleep—Children are naturally lively and happy. If there are occasional abnormalities, it must be physical discomfort. At this time, measure their temperature, check whether their throat is red and swollen, and whether their tongue coating is normal. If it is due to indigestion, give them some laxatives to clear their bowels. If it is not effective, consult a doctor.</p>
<p>C. Sudden loss of appetite—Do not force children to eat if they do not want food. First, change the type of food. If they still do not want to eat, leave them alone. Sometimes, older children may have a poor appetite due to too much work and mental stress. If they have normal bowel movements every day, it does not matter if they eat less. As long as the food is nutritious and clean, it will naturally be beneficial.</p>
<p>D. Large appetite but skin and bones—This phenomenon is because all the food they eat has no nutritional value and is only for their teeth and stomach to work on. There are parasites in the intestines, and stool must be examined. After the worms are expelled, they can gradually become healthy.</p>
<p>(3) Give children the best treatment—</p>
<p>A. Food</p>
<p>(1) Emphasize quality over quantity. Absolutely do not eat useless food.</p>
<p>(2) Eat food at regular times. Absolutely do not eat snacks.</p>
<p>(3) Drink more boiled water.</p>
<p>(4) Eat more fruits. Although Chinese people now know that fruits are rich in vitamins, they often neglect cleanliness, which leads to various gastrointestinal diseases. This is because there are many bacteria on the fruit peel, which can easily be carried into the fruit, especially bananas. Therefore, fruits must first be washed with potassium permanganate or at least soaked in boiled water before peeling and eating.</p>
<p>B. Sleep—Sleep is as important as food.</p>
<p>(1) Children under five years old must have one or two hours of sleep in the afternoon in addition to sleeping at night.</p>
<p>(2) Do not take children out for social events or play at night, as this will make them too excited and prevent them from sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>(3) Bedding should be comfortable, and mosquitoes and bedbugs should be avoided in summer.</p>
<p>(4) Do not eat food before going to bed, and do not eat too much for dinner.</p>
<p>C. Environment—In addition to going to school and visiting parks, allow the child to have opportunities to play at home as much as possible. Give them plenty of toys, good companions, and simple sports equipment so that children can spend their time, not think about snacks, and not wander around the neighborhood. Older children can go out as small guests or be small hosts at home. Children over five years old can read various stories, which is also a way to guide them in the right direction.</p>
<p>D. Cooperation from family members—Elders in traditional Chinese families like to feed children, no matter the time or what it is. As soon as they see a child, they want to feed them and make them eat non-stop. Even some more modern people cannot avoid this problem, which is very unfavorable for children. This is because children's stomachs have very small capacities. Filling them with food at times other than meal times makes them lose their appetite for regular meals, which deprives them of a nutritious meal. My child can finish half a pound of fresh milk at once when hungry, but after eating two biscuits, they cannot eat lunch. Therefore, family members must cooperate. If possible, a person with some medical knowledge should lead the child and pay attention to all aspects of the child's life every day.</p>
<p>E. Medical advisor—Since children inevitably get sick, it is best to designate an experienced doctor to treat them. A doctor who is used to seeing your child will have records of your child, know their constitution, and their medical history. Moreover, in case of an emergency, they will not be at a loss. Because there are many kinds of infectious diseases that children inevitably contract:</p>
<p>(1) Measles—Although this disease is not dangerous, it has complications. The doctor can give your child a blood transfusion so that they do not have difficulty getting measles. After the measles have come out, you can take medicine to prevent pneumonia, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Diphtheria—Diphtheria vaccination can be given.</p>
<p>(3) Cowpox and vaccinations—We Chinese people now believe in this and are willing to get injections.</p>
<p>(4) Whooping cough—In the past, it was thought that whooping cough had to cough for a hundred days to heal, but now there are ways to prevent it. When whooping cough is prevalent, vaccinations can be given. After the disease has been contracted, seek medical treatment while paying attention to the child's nutrition to replenish the calories lost from coughing.</p>
<p>(5) Dangerous diseases such as meningitis and scarlet fever—When these diseases are prevalent, absolutely do not enter public places. If a neighbor has this disease, they must be sent to an isolation hospital to prevent the spread of infection.</p>
<p>The above points are all that ordinary and middle-class families can afford to do. However, this is by no means a one-day effort. Mothers should treat raising children as a job, as important as fathers going to the office every day. If children have a fixed time for work, play, rest, sleep, and diet, they will not only be healthy, but it will also affect their future lifestyle. If children grow up in a confused way, living with illness and prolonging life, it will be too late to have a healthy body, and it cannot be remedied by taking a few vitamin pills.</p>
<h3>Tomatoes</h3>
<p>— By Mu Yan</p>
<p>Now is the season for tomatoes.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are also known as 西紅柿 (xī hóng shì, "Western red persimmons"). In fact, it would be more appropriate to call it a "persimmon" than an "eggplant" because it resembles a persimmon in shape, content, and color, but not an eggplant. However, the name "tomato" has been used for so long that I will also use this common name.</p>
<p>It originated in the Americas and was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. At that time, Italians called it "golden apple," and the British and French called it "love apple." As the name suggests, you can imagine how pleasing its beautiful form was.</p>
<p>Its flesh is thick and juicy, containing various vitamins necessary for the human body, of which vitamin A is the richest, followed by B, and C is also abundant. In addition, it also contains minerals such as iron, phosphorus, and calcium, making it an all-around nutritious food.</p>
<p>Eating it raw, although not as sweet as persimmons, has its own flavor once you get used to it. If you soak it in boiled water, peel off the skin, and dip it in sugar, the taste is even better. Boiling it into soup makes it very delicious.</p>
<p>In short, it is a delicious and highly nutritious fruit that is worth eating regularly.</p>
<h3>Women are "People"</h3>
<p>— By Yan</p>
<p>According to a report, a businessman from Wenzhou named Lin Zhenting married eight or nine years ago and had two daughters. Using the excuse of not having a son, he took another concubine. Later, the concubine also gave birth to a daughter. Lin was angry that she did not give birth to a son and forced her to leave. Then he married a woman named Yu Xiu as a concubine. Who knew that she gave birth to two daughters in five years, without a single son. Lin was usually moody, and his wives and concubines were often abused. Recently, Yu Xiu, having found someone else she liked, filed for divorce. Lin was reluctant to let her go and begged Yu Xiu to remain as husband and wife, and said that he would accept any other conditions. But Yu Xiu was determined and unmoved, laughing at her husband's cries. As a result, the marriage contract was terminated by others, and Yu Xiu went away with her new love.</p>
<p>Being abandoned by a concubine after abandoning a concubine, to say it in a superstitious way, is karma. But we know that this is because times have progressed, and women have realized that they are "people," not reproductive machines.</p>
<h3>The Harmful Effects of DDT</h3>
<p>— By Ru Shui</p>
<p>Since its introduction, DDT has been very popular and has made immortal contributions to agriculture. However, after repeated research by scientists, it is known that while it is extremely effective in killing pests, it also affects other organisms, especially when it is put into water to kill mosquito larvae, it threatens the survival of fish. If DDT is sprinkled in fish ponds, the yield of fish will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>According to the example of big fish eating small fish, what do small fish eat? People who study fish tell us that small fish eat microorganisms. These things, although pitifully small, are the best food for small fish. With small fish, big fish will naturally not starve to death. If these small things all die, small fish will be difficult to survive, and big fish will not be able to be raised.</p>
<p>Professor Anderson of the United States recently conducted an experiment to prove that this is true. He gathered water fleas, which are so small that they are not easily noticed by the human eye, and dropped a small amount of DDT. Within thirty-two hours, more than half of these small things became rigid. He said that in DDT with a concentration between one part per billion and one hundred, microorganisms can become rigid in sixteen to thirty-two hours. If the concentration is less than one part per billion, they can still survive. He took the water of Lake Erie as an example. In some places, their lifespan can be extended to one hundred and thirty hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, when trying to kill mosquito larvae in water, we must consider the lives of fish in some places!</p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p>— By Shao Fu</p>
<p>This summer, I don't know why, floods are happening everywhere. Besides the breaches at Huayuankou and Hongze Lake, which are Communist "virtuous policies" engraved in the hearts of the people, the water level in Hankou has reached more than 25 meters, and the situation is critical. The water level of the Yellow River in Suixi is rising, and the canals are breached. Hangzhou streets are flooded like canals, and the water of West Lake is only a foot away from the shore. On the Fuchun River, you can see timber, houses, and furniture washed down. The floods in Suzhou are severe, and the ten-mile embankment from Fengqiao to Huguan has been washed away, and the land next to the embankment is a vast expanse of water. The water level of Taihu Lake has risen sharply, and the tragic scene of the great flood of 1931 is about to be repeated. In Shanghai, after the heavy rain, the area around Pubushi Road was submerged in water for many days, and even the middle section of Linsen Road was flooded. Many citizens have benefited from it.</p>
<p>The causes of floods are generally no more than three: flash floods, dilapidated embankments, and problems with drainage ditches and sewers, or their complete lack.</p>
<p>China is a country that relies on the weather to eat, but human will can conquer nature, and it is not a dream. If the embankments are strong and there are no breaches (of course, the most ideal method of water control should be "opening the flow" rather than "preventing the flow," but it is probably not possible to talk about it at present), and there are canals for drainage and channels for sewers, then even if there are flash floods, the water will return to the sea, so why would it flood? Flash floods are not as bad as breaking dikes, and other countries have them too.</p>
<p>Repairing dikes and channels is urgent and cannot be delayed. In the autumn of 1931, it can be said that we were too busy with the Northeast to take care of it. This year is already the second year after the victory.</p>
<h3>Military Officers Dismount · Civil Servants Park</h3>
<p>— By Lu Jun</p>
<p>Random notes from the "Capital Hostel" in Nanjing</p>
<p>People who are used to living in Sichuan have a kind of apprehensive feeling about the small inns in small counties where they "seek lodging before it's late" and "look at the sky early when the rooster crows." Some small inns still use the old-fashioned large beds, printed blue cloth tents, and straw mattresses all year round. There are so many bedbugs and fleas that it is impossible to count them, making people unable to close their eyes all night. And they still hang red lanterns at the door that say "Scholars park, dignitaries dismount", which really makes people not dare to accept!</p>
<p>Before the government returned to the capital, there was a serious housing shortage in Nanjing. Many hotels had not yet resumed business. So, Mayor Ma Chaojun initiated the establishment of a "Capital Hostel." On the opening day, Mayor Ma himself went to preside over it.</p>
<p>This hostel is the same as ordinary hotels, and it also charges fees, but it charges less. The procedure for accommodation is to submit a business trip certificate or an organization service certificate, so businessmen are not entertained. The location of the hostel is very suitable, in Gongyuan Street in Confucius Temple. There are a total of fifty rooms. In the past, this was a Japanese cafe, which was quite large. The hostel used part of the rooms and the entire upper floor, and rented the bottom floor to a Jingu Restaurant to open a dance hall. The income was not bad, but unfortunately dancing is now "prohibited" in Nanjing. Jingu is about to close. The hostel is advertising for bids to rent it out again, and because summer has arrived, the cafe business is booming, even the open space along the Qinhuai River behind and the large living room upstairs are all rented out. But the first bidding had no result, and it is being re-bid.</p>
<p>Because this place does not entertain non-"public education personnel", some people who want to live there can only sigh at the "place". Those high officials who have just flown in from various places are entertained here. Zhu Ping, the director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, lived here for half a month, and the chief of staff of the ×× army also lived here for a long time. It is really "military officers dismount, civil servants park". However, they have a regulation that after living for ten days, if they want to continue living, they have to add 40% to the price, and more than 20 days to add 60%, to show restrictions, saying that they do not welcome long-term accommodation!</p>
<p>The equipment inside, except that the 万象癥 downstairs has been changed from a dance floor to a singing hall, there is a billiard room upstairs and a sales department. The District Office of the Third District of Nanjing City is also located here.</p>
<p>Because the hostel is "officially" operated, it is exempt from taxes. They have a board of directors, and the heads of the party, government, military, and organizations are all directors. Below them is a general manager. The organization looks like an official yamen, and it does not look like a hotel at all.</p>
<h3>Housing Shortage in Nanjing: The Problem is Not Scarcity but Inequality</h3>
<p>— By Lu Jin</p>
<p>The newspapers are printed daily with the headline in special bold type: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! Government officials often give speeches: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! Small civil servants who have returned to the capital shout themselves hoarse: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! So, it seems very important, Nanjing really seems to be suffering from a housing shortage. Actually, no!</p>
<p>Why is there not enough housing in Nanjing at present? Why can't many people find housing? To put it simply and clearly: the distribution is unreasonable and unequal!</p>
<p>The government has completely returned to the capital. With so many institutions and yamen, so many people, big and small, plus so many wives and young masters, housing has become a serious problem. But, if you have a way, you have connections, you can still solve the housing problem. Now the large and small schools and enemy-puppet properties in Nanjing are all occupied by military units. A guard stands at the door, but in fact, the inside is empty. The former Ministry of Railways, now the large building of the Executive Yuan, is empty everywhere. An old master of ×× lives in a foreign house, and a servant also lives in a room. The wife and young master naturally have to live in three or five rooms. The puppet military school on Huangpu Road has empty houses and cannot do anything about it. It is even haunted every day. Many, many Japanese shops still have seals on them, and the inside has become a world of garbage and mice. ... With so many unreasonable things, you say: how can Nanjing not suffer from a housing shortage? Where can those small civil servants go to find houses?</p>
<p>Nanjing only received fifty of the mobile homes shipped from the United States. Now not only have they not been installed, but some of the materials have disappeared without a trace. Ordinary people can only sigh at the houses. There are many large and small hotels, but several thousand yuan a day is not affordable for ordinary people.</p>
<p>In fact, solving the housing shortage in Nanjing is very simple. I have three brilliant plans: The first is to rationally distribute the illegally occupied houses and the unsealed houses. The second is to use the empty land in Nanjing to build simple civilian houses. Nanjing has plenty of empty land. Zhongshan East Road is now being carried out. The third: it sounds relatively empty, but it is not difficult to implement. That is to requisition those unnecessary dance halls and teahouses and turn them into temporary apartments to solve the housing shortage problem for civil servants who have returned to the capital. If this is really the case, will Nanjing still suffer from a housing shortage?</p>
<h3>Corpse Odor</h3>
<p>— By Ying Xiang</p>
<p>South of the racecourse, in front of the Xipushan Villa of the Chinese Brain Hospital, the stench of corpses fills the air, and pedestrians cover their noses. This stupid person passed by twice in half a month and suffered from the foul smell, which caused discomfort. At this time when the epidemic is rampant, I sincerely hope that the authorities will pay attention!</p>
<h3>Indian Hands</h3>
<p>— By Luo Ting</p>
<p>Indians have interesting hands. When eating, Orientals use chopsticks and Westerners use knives and forks, but Indians, like the Xinjiang people when eating "grabbed rice," use a pair of primitive hands. They grab the rice with one hand, twist it a few times with the other hand, and put it in their mouths. But these hands are not only useful when eating, but also play a great role when defecating. That is, they use their hands instead of toilet paper after defecating. After finishing their work, they wash themselves in the 簞 (dān, a kind of bamboo container) that they often carry with water. The 簞 is small and not carried in the hand when going out, but carried on the head. Sometimes we can see it in movies. But when they are thirsty, they use the water in the 簞 as a drink. This must be very strange to us, but it is a habit for them.</p>
<h3>Dull Theater Scene in the Capital</h3>
<p>— By Wei Cheng</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu, the veteran of the China Travel Troupe, was truly a prominent figure in the theater world some years ago. Who didn't know him, who didn't know him? Unfortunately, he is now outdated and has to hide with his incomplete troupe in a small theater in the corner of the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, "Flying Dragon Pavilion", which can only accommodate 800 people, to make a living.</p>
<p>Now at the entrance of the Flying Dragon Pavilion, in addition to the name of the play being performed, Tang Huaiqiu's name is also very noticeable. Their directors are Sun Lu and Tang Qi, etc., and the main actors are Tang Ruoqing and Lin Na, and the box office is not bad. This time, the Nanjing People's Daily launched the Nanjing Twelve Celebrities election, and Tang Ruoqing was also selected.</p>
<p>Some of the plays being staged were written by Old Guan Tang himself. He still cannot get rid of the past "business experience" style, especially the performance of "one-act plays", which is completely the same as the style of the "Traveling Magic Troupe" ten years ago, making people laugh! Recently, the style has changed slightly. They are staging Cao Yu's famous works "Wilderness" and "Thunderstorm", etc. The tickets are 1,600 yuan each, and the business is not bad. However, their expenses are very large. It is not easy to eat. They need money to rent the venue, and the actors also need pocket money!</p>
<p>Everything is suffering from a recession this year, and our drama world is naturally no exception. The life of a drama actor is truly worlds apart compared to the life of a Peking opera actress, which is something that everyone is deeply dissatisfied with. The China Travel Troupe is also like this!</p>
<p>The China Travel Troupe is the only one performing drama in Nanjing. Therefore, strictly speaking, the results of their performances are not very good. This is called a unique business. No one competes with them, so naturally they are sloppy and perfunctory. The directing skills of several plays are considered successful, but due to the crude scenery, this defect cannot be compensated. If this were in Shanghai, there is no doubt that the China Travel Troupe would be defeated!</p>
<p>The China Travel Troupe in Nanjing is not considered to be very sensational, nor is it considered to have achieved anything. It is just ordinary and makes a living! Therefore, many people believe that this is the decline of the Nanjing drama world, and it is also the time when the China Travel Troupe is at the end of its rope! Judging from the past history of the China Travel Troupe, this is very regrettable!</p>
<h3>Voice of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Xi Ting</p>
<p>—Musical Activities in Nanjing</p>
<p>Music and drama are both quite subdued in Nanjing; however, comparatively speaking, the atmosphere of music is slightly better.</p>
<p>During the period of the occupation, the puppet regime once presided over a "Capital Harmony Singing Troupe," which was a "meritorious achievement" of the puppet mayor Zhou Xuechang. After the victory, the piano of the "Harmony Singing Troupe" was taken over by the Youth League, but a new singing troupe was not organized for a while, nor was it easy to organize.</p>
<p>Small-scale "musical soirees," "musical tea parties," and lackluster concerts were held five or six times after the victory, but due to various difficulties and the relatively sluggish atmosphere in Nanjing, they did not attract social attention. On the contrary, ballroom "music" and popular tunes seemed particularly popular. On the streets of Shanghai, one could not hear such lively singing as in the areas of Xin Jie Kou and Taiping Road in Nanjing.</p>
<p>However, after the return of the capital, the musical atmosphere in the capital gradually changed. Although the Zhi Zhi Society's orchestra is still in its infancy, it has a great effect in advocating pure music in Nanjing. There are frequent performances recently, and the location of the Zhi Zhi Society is indeed not bad, and entering it is refreshing.</p>
<p>The most influential event in Nanjing's music scene was the recital given by female vocalist Guan Yixuan at the Zhi Zhi Society on June 18. The results were truly amazing. In particular, the several Chinese songs she selected were very pleasing, both catering to the taste and not being vulgar. "Man Jiang Hong," "I Live at the Head of the Yangtze River," "The Drinking Song from La Traviata," and "Homesick Song" all won great interest from the audience. In particular, "Man Jiang Hong" and "The Drinking Song from La Traviata" were both encored.</p>
<p>In addition, Wu Zhengqian recently performed once in Beijing in collaboration with double bassist Ji Hanwen.</p>
<p>The Music and Drama Section of the Zhi Zhi Society is working hard to promote musical activities in the capital, and I think it will definitely sweep away the dullness of the capital.</p>
<p>In terms of national music, the Datong Music Society has also begun to resume its activities in Beijing, and the "Chinese Orchestra" of the Central Broadcasting Station is also recovering. These are all good news for the capital's music scene.</p>
<p>This is a brief overview of the dynamics of the capital's music scene before I left Beijing (at the end of June).</p>

<h3>Letters to My Deceased Wife, Feng Ming (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Although you had a tendency to believe in Christianity while you were ill, you were never baptized and cannot be considered a Christian; on the other hand, you do not believe in Buddhism, nor do you believe in monks or Taoists. Therefore, it can be said that you had no religious beliefs in your life. However, Bao Mei and the others thought that following social customs, the embellishment of monks and Taoists was indispensable, so they invited three Taoists from the nearby Guandi Temple to guide you on your way, so that your newly departed soul would not get lost; that evening, they also invited five monks from the Guanyin Hall to perform Buddhist rites of remembrance, and the sound of bells, cymbals, and chanting continued until dawn. I placed all the red roses and white tuberoses that were offered in the bottle on your body. You originally loved these flowers very much, but alas, at this moment you are unconscious and insensitive, how can you appreciate their color and fragrance again!</p>
<p>The next morning, Zou Jinglao received the tragic news and hurried over. He accompanied Zheng Er to purchase the coffin, bedding, lotus flower hat, Guanyin bib, and other items. Because I was completely ignorant of these matters, I entrusted everything to the old gentleman. According to the Taoist priest, this day was a "day of double bereavement" and was not suitable for encoffining, so the body had to be kept at home. By evening, the three daughters, Mei, Xing, and Ying, had received the urgent telegram from the previous night and had all rushed back from Shanghai to attend the funeral. Because they had not seen you to the end, they knelt in front of your bed and cried with particular sadness. At this time, all six children had arrived at your side. If you knew in death, you should be able to rest in peace, right? After nightfall, five nuns were invited again to perform another Buddhist rite of remembrance; I was so exhausted in body and mind that I could no longer support myself and went to sleep in the Mei house.</p>
<p>It was said that the third day was another "day of double bereavement," and according to custom, encoffining was still not allowed, but it was okay if a mud Buddha was secretly placed in the coffin with its back to people; we decided to do as such. At seven o'clock in the morning, Bao Mei combed your hair and dressed you in newly made spun silk clothing. Then the undertakers from the Shouxing Bridge Renji Funeral Home came to take your remains away. Alas, Feng! From then on, you will never return to this home full of flowers and trees that you loved so much during your lifetime! In Suzhou, I don't have a single relative, I am truly "without relatives to look to," and even the number of friends is very few, less than twenty people in total; although I posted a funeral announcement in the Ming Bao newspaper, everyone may not pay attention. Fortunately, Zou Jinglao pulled in a few enthusiastic friends for me; at eleven o'clock, your younger brother Hongxin, nephew Yucheng, son-in-law of Mei, Jingren, and son-in-law of Xing, Junqing, arrived from Shanghai together, finally there were relatives and friends. The funeral ceremony was held at two o'clock in the afternoon. When my six children and I watched you lying in the coffin, we couldn't help but wail and weep, and we were so grieved that we wanted to die. Especially me, who had depended on you for twenty-nine years, my heart was broken, my intestines were severed, and I wished I could sleep with you forever!</p>
