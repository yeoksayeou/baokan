<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕長春之戰，共軍顯已佔得優勢，全國人士之視錢，乃因馬歇爾特使之晋見蔣主席，而自東北移至重慶。蓋國人一致期望已成沉疴之東北問題，能因馬氏之返華而起死回生也。頃據今日自渝還都之某權威政府觀察家記者，當前國共最大癥結，厥為東北問題，比一問題苟能獲得協議，則其他如各地停戰命令之澈底執行，國大代表之推選，國府改組之參加等急待實行之各大問題，均可迎刃而解。目前東北問題在東北當地雖已形成流行之痛心塲面，然因馬歇爾元帥之返渝，猶可望見一綫政治解決之曙光，且據可靠消息，此次馬帥歸來，所携之華新訓令，似對共黨有加强壓力之朕兆，其最顯著之一點，即馬帥返國後，美國務院呼籲洽商之對華鉅額貸款，原定係畀我依政協會決議改組後之中央政府者，現則決定立即畀予我國民政府，馬帥抵渝之翌日，即訪宋院長子文，似即與此事有關，由此而窺全豹，則今日馬帥二度來華，所抱之見解，顯與上次稍有不同。過敏之觀察家，甚至已在憶及赫爾利大使矣，據該權威人士指陳，此一美國對華新政策，在共黨領袖間，似日有預測，聞前飛延安失事喪命之王若飛，葉挺一行，即爲以重慶觀感歸而就商毛澤東，俾決定諸對策者，故預料國內大局日內重慶將有重大決定。</p>

<h3 id="c33">解決屋荒的合理方法——住宅合作社 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 陳仲明</p>
<p>一　都市屋荒的原因及其影響</p>
<p>「屋荒」巳經變成流行症了，其內容愈鬧愈複雜，範團愈演愈廣闊。如今全國大至都市，小至縣鎭，無一不被這一浪潮所襲擊，所不同者，程度而已。硏討都市屋荒的原因計有：（一）由於戰爭的破壞，原有房屋的數量大減；（二）國內政局不安，地方秩序不寗，人民相率逃亡，集中於各大都市：（三）物價高漲，建築材料昂貴，一般平民，無力建築；（四）强有力者，任意覇佔；（五）敵偽房屋未能妥善分配。隨着屋荒而來的不良現象與影饗有三：</p>
<p>（一）房屋所有者乘機榨取，二房東從中取利，高抬屋價，猛增房祖。以上海爲例，頂屋費用動輒需黃金數條乃至數十條之多，租金多以美鈔英鎊計算者，似此金樓銀閣，非法勒索，除少數富商大賈問津外，一般平民，莫不感到居住壓迫的痛苦。</p>
<p>（二）有些房屋，原僅足一家居住者，現竟擁塞數家，其空氣汚濁，聲音嘈雜，行動拘束，妨碍衛生，影響市民健康，至爲重大。</p>
<p>（三）各種事業機與一般公敎人員，因覓屋困難，棲息無所，以致焦慮頻仍，工作無力，似此不僅减抵個人的工作效率，亦且爲國家社會的損失。</p>
<p>二　合理解決方法——組織住宅合作社</p>
<p>住宅合作在諸般合作形態之中，係比較新近的一種，其目的在以合作的方式，運用集體的力量，建築舒適的住宅，使得每個社員，乃至非社員，都可以獲得美好的生活環境。我國經濟落後，人民生活原極艱苦，近復慘罹戰爭浩刦，人命物質的損失，幾至無法估計。然各城市最觸目的損失，莫過於一般建築物的毀壞。政府自宜應時事的需要，在各大都市緊急興造大規模的平民住宅與公共宿舍，以供平民居住。惟因國一庫又細，尤以際茲建國之始，百廢待興，政府恐無力及此。然人民不可一日無居，似此情形，吾人認爲祗有聯合同一需要的同胞，大量地組織住宅合作社才能解決。蓋建築一座住宅，需要鉅額的建築費用，良好的建築技術，並須考慮衛生。安全。交通等條件，這些問題，均非大多數人可以獨力做成的，必須運用多數人的力量與資金，始能收取功效。因此，審度我國國情，實在迫切地需要住宅合作的。其顯著的功能與優點有；</p>
<p>（甲）組織住宅合作社，可以集合團體的力量與資金，合力建築或租賃所需要的房屋，並進而附設各種敎育。衛生。交通。娛樂等設備，以養成社員國團體生活的習慣。</p>
<p>（乙）利用合作的漸進鬥爭方式，消滅一切資本主義的房屋壟斷與投機等不合理現象。</p>
<p>（丙）依據合作的平等互助原則，應用現代科學技術與建築工程，以建造最有用·美麗·舒適·衛生的住宅。</p>
<p>三　住宅合作社的幾個經營方式</p>
<p>解決房屋恐慌的辦法有二：一曰治標的，統計現有的房屋與居民人數，而加以公允合理的分配。一曰治本的，積極的迅速的建築大量的平民住宅與其他建築物，以供各機關與一般市民的需要。上海房屋雖無統計，然其不足使用，當屬毫無疑義。所以，欲解決上海乃至全國各大都市的房屋恐慌，光求現有房屋分配的合理，仍然不能收效的，必需注重房屋的添建，以求其根本解決。惟不論治標治本，這兩種辦法，均可以合作社來做經營的主體，用合作的彩態來實行。茲特擬製其經營方式如次，以供參考：</p>
<p>（一）對於敵偽房屋，擬以住宅合作社的名義，請求當局撥租與合作社，以作合理的分配，庶幾可以免去你爭我奪及武力覇佔等不良現象。</p>
<p>（二）由市民集資合力組織住宅合作社，以建築新的房屋。必要時得以所建築的房屋作爲抵押，而向金融機關通融一部份的建築資金，所借的款項，由社員以長年分期辦法償還之。</p>
<p>（三）迅速請求善後救濟總署，供給新式活動式房屋，或向美國直接大量購買，以應目前的緊急需要。</p>
<p>四　住宅合作的組織原則</p>
<p>組織住宅合作社除遵循一般合作社的原理與方法外，必須注意下列幾個基本原則：</p>
<p>（一）合作社的業務以社員福利爲目的，不以利潤爲目的。</p>
<p>（二）住宅合作社的房屋，以專供社員本身及其直系親屬等利用爲原則。</p>
<p>（三）各住宅的所有權或租賃權的賣買授予，必須依章提經理事會通過，並呈報社員大會備案。</p>
<p>（四）合作社必須實行民主管理，由加入的社員自己管理，一人一票，它是人的結合，而非資本的結合。</p>
<p>五　結論</p>
<p>戰事結束了，留下的却是工業停滯，通貨膨脹，在都市則投機猖狂，在農村則飢餓遍野，國民的衣食住行與治安，幾乎件件皆成問題。這一切都需要政府與人民拿出堅强的毅力來共同克服的，祗是怒駡，怨憤，係無補於事實的。本文之作，旨在對於上海及其他各大都市的屋荒，稍稍有所補救。筆者通再度呼籲，希望各界能認識合作，研討合作，以合作方式來解決當前嚴重的「房屋恐慌」。我不否認尙有其他途徑可以解決屋荒，惟審情度勢，合作方式係比較適合我國現階段的環境，此乃解決我國人住的問題最合理最迅速的方法。深望國內賢達與合作同志，予以熱烈的贊助與普遍推行。</p>

<p>杜魯門總統（左）與胡佛（右）在白宮商糧食急賑問題</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕杜魯門總統於復活節向全國廣播，籲請美國人民與全世界飢民共享所有食物，蓋健全之世界秩序，決不能建築在人類疾苦之基礎上。前總統胡佛。農業部長安特森·與聯總署長賴伽第亞，亦於同日發表廣播。杜魯門總統並稱，歐亞兩洲現有無數人民正奄奄乖斃，此爲一無可置疑之事。政府已採取有力辦法，擬每月輸出小麥數百萬噸，惟美國人民必須犧性自己以救活他人，我人若不節食，則數百萬人定將餓死。因此余再度籲請美國全體人民節省麵包，並保存脂肪，此乃我人與國外飢荒撲鬥之最重要武器。今日每一美國人均應宣誓分出其餘糧，「高談闊論之時期已過，實行之時期已至。」</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕美國杜魯門總統昨復致電胡佛，准其繼紗考察世界糧食情形，但促其縮短印度之行程，能於五月十日前回美云云。此係杜魯門與胡佛昨在橫渡大西洋電話中所商定之計劃。現悉胡佛將至印度·中國·印度·日本等地考察，可能亦將至菲列賓一行，然後於下月十日前回國。預計在五月十二日胡佛當可向美國人民發表其第一次報吿。</p>

<p>〔路透社開羅二十日電〕社魯門總統之飢饉委員會主席胡佛昨於此間向美國人民廣播，代歐洲一萬萬五千萬飢民呼籲。胡氏當提出六項建議，以爲緊急措施：（一）美政府應大量搜集糧食及小麥，於四·五·六七等四月內，平均每月應輸出一百十萬噸，汕脂方面美人亦應作類似之犧牲。（二）歐洲國家其每人每日之麵包配給量，在三百公分以上者，應减爲三百公分，但余深知英荷丹及南斯拉夫等國，將因此而增加負担。（三）英人所存榖物約一百萬噸，較戰前存底幾增一倍，故望其能撥出五十萬噸以救飢民。（四）美國加拿大阿根廷應於今後四月內减少對南美國家之輸出，而此等南美國家能慨然允諾，誠爲最有價値之帮助，（五）蘇聯供給之糧食，於今後四月內若能每月增加三十萬噸，實為對人類一大貢獻。（六）被解放之小國痛苦最深，其國內產量有限，應予以優先接濟。以上建議如經採納，則美國將供應接濟品總額的百分之四十四，加拿大的百分之二十，英國及澳洲各約百分之十，阿根廷及蘇聯約百分之十二。胡佛繼稱，此次世界之糧食危機，具有一定之期限，爲歷史上所未有。歐洲自蘇聯西疆以至英吉利海峽，有人口三萬萬，其中僅四千萬人，糧食可維特至秋收以前，其餘人口中之三分之一係屬農民，不致發生糧食問題，最苦者爲城市居民一萬萬五千萬名，必須仰給於國外之大量供給。再歐洲今日之低能及病孩逾二千萬名，兒童爲歐洲今後之基礎，乃大陸安危之決定因素。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司對於戰後航空事業，決擬積極擴充。據該公司負責當局昨日語記者：中航公司計劃開闢菲列賓及日本一帶航綫，同時增加國內各綫，但限於經費，致進行頗爲困難。前已向美國訂購C54飛機六架，此機每小時可飛行二百餘興，供長距離之用，將於五月中抵華。但本市龍華機塲跑道碎石遍地，路面不平，此項飛機升降甚爲危險，是否能借江灣機塲停降，須經美軍等多方接治，亦頗費週析。國外航綫站現僅加爾各答一處，擬增設之日本一帶航站，目前猶無頭緒，因經費人才兩缺也。</p>
<p>修理檢查　人工繁多</p>
<p>該公司現有之C47飛機，約可載重二噸半，每小時飛行需用汽油九十加侖，飛行一次準備機油五十加侖，C46機可載重約四噸牛，每小時需汽油一百二十加侖，飛行每小時一百四十哩。現公司方面已向美空軍購C46機八架，將陸續到達。</p>
<p>又據該公司負責人云：「機價雖非昂貴，然機件缺乏，人才短少，乃最大因難。飛行一次各部均須修理檢査，在美國每一機須二百人服務，在中國至少亦須五十人，如此複雜情形，實非一般人想像中所認爲簡易之事。」</p>
<p>女侍應生　不耐高飛</p>
<p>中航公司現有職工共計約二千餘人，飛機師五十餘人，其中包括外籍機師，蓋經費有限，機師待遇菲薄，致以前機師多數辭職他就，該公司三月份虧蝕達十一萬萬元。現有飛機共約五十架，但實際飛行者僅二十餘架。飛行人員工作極爲辛勞，必須時常休息。高空飛行對身體頗有損害，故如機中女侍應生等，年長者即不能擔任，長距離飛行亦非彼輩體力所堪。總之，如欲擴展至有規模之工作，尙須一年半之後。至關於飛行不幸遇險事，現奉交通部令，乘客必須在行前辦理保險，然乘客對此舉多數不願。保險公司方面亦頗少願出高價者，此事現正接洽中。現該公司之重慶航錢，每日一班，平均三架至四架，北平每星期一·三·五·三次，香港每星期二·四·兩次。又爲便利運貨起見，已定收貨代運，每公斤四千零八十元。但因載客異常擁擠，每日最多僅收三千公斤，而暫以重慶一錢爲限。</p>

<h3 id="c76">事齊事楚·左右兩難！　香港商民感苦悶 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 本報航訊香港特約記者林友蘭寄</p>
<p>上次通訊，說到香港何時恢復民政的問題，香港的人士渴望恢復民政，要是嚴格的說一句：還不如說他們渴望早日恢復繁榮。香港的人士，不會厚愛於什麽民政或軍政，他們祗希望市塲繁榮，荷囊豐滿。對於「政治」，那些「買辦階級」是從來不感到多大興趣的。</p>
<p>自從本年度開始，駛進香港來的大洋船，一個月比一個月多。美國的水菓，化妝品，罐頭食物，澳洲的糧食，日用品，工業原料，相繼運港，數量雖然並不怎樣充足，但仍不失爲一個「信號」：吿訴香港對外的貿易關係，業已重建起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c77">第一批美貸　被擱淺在棧房內 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>年年底，香港一般商人對前途的感想，是保持相當樂觀態度的。他們以爲港元外匯比率業已決定，英美船隻也陸續駛來香港，祇要有充足的錢，便可購得充足的貨物，有了貨物，也就是有了市塲和利潤，轉瞬之間，昔日的繁榮便回來了。</p>
<p>然而，事實沒有和理想那麼簡單，三個月來的經歷老老實實吿訴他們：香港因爲種種關係，距離繁榮之鵠的，尙遙遠得很。最先給那些白天做好夢的人們一個雷鳴的，就是格蘭總統號戰後載進來第一批望眼欲穿的美貨，却因爲「手續」問題，被當局扳起面孔「擱淺」在堆棧裏—有話且慢慢談判。</p>
<p>向英澳定貸　商人夙願亦難償</p>
<p>商人們看見自己的美貨被封在堆棧裏嘆氣，而其他的美貨却一批又一批在上海起岸，輾轉運到香港來，無限的利潤一聲不嚮地流進別人的荷囊裏。</p>
<p>他們獲得了一個深刻的敎訓。</p>
<p>他們向倫敦定貨，英國的廠商却不能答應什麼時候可以把貨物裝輪運到香港來。他們轉向澳洲採購，澳洲的生產和輪運，十時也就求過於供，無法大量接濟，他們委曲求全，亦難償其夙願，內心眞是有苦說不出！</p>
<p>今後粵市塲　非港商所能獨步</p>
<p>作爲一個貨物出納口的香港，牠的全盛時期是一九三七年，中國內地貨物，經香港輸出的，佔總額百分之卅四。外國貨物經香港輸人中國內地的，佔總額百分之四十六。現在，不惟談不上對中國的輸人，就是香港本地的消費也感捉襟見肘，難於應付。由於上海貨物水陸並進，源源直運廣州，縱使黃埔開港之說成了神話，今後廣州的市塲，巳非香港商人所能獨步，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>在另一方面，香港也是一個生產中心，戰前香港大小工廠，數達千家以上。因爲人工低廉，原料便利，其中的紡織業，樹膠業，手電筒業，油漆業等，不特雄視華南市塲，抑且遠銷海外。</p>
<p>原料與資金　鉗住了工業生機</p>
<p>現在，一切都陷入半停頓狀態中。當局最近運到一批樹膠和棉紗，配給若干工廠，但粥少僧多，無補大局。而印度和馬來亞方面對原料輸出的限制，至今還未取銷，商人即欲自行定購，也沒有辦法，香港中華廠商聯合會，曾致電經濟部請求根據上海方面的前例，貸款協助復興業務，但沒有答覆。原料和資金好像兩大鐵鉗，活活的把香港工業的生機緊緊的窒息。這又是香港工業界對上海的同業不勝羨慕的地方。</p>
<p>尤有進者，財部日前已正式宣佈，國產凡經香港轉往廣州者，便失掉國產內銷的優待、和香港貨一視同仁，抽百分之二十以上的進口稅，上海貨勢難再經香港轉口了。廣州貨物運往香港出口的，最近亦須辦理結匯手續，香港商人對此情景，眞够傷腦筋了。</p>
<p>大環境變動　香港失去支配力</p>
<p>經過這回戰事，香港以外的大環境委實變動太大了，香港的小環境夾在大環境中，現已失掉過去的「車然自立」或「唯我獨尊」的支配力，反受大環境的限制。我們可以這樣說：時至今日，香港的命運已走進新軌道。這條新軌道，橫亙在香港商人的限前，他們亦看得淸淸楚楚，但仍有點躊躇，而他們的黃金機會，便也喪失在躊躇之中。</p>
<p>鐵一般的事實擺出來：作爲香港市塲原動力的，不是金鎊而是大洋，不是遠在大西洋岸的英格蘭銀行，而是近在國門的財富。香港的經濟，祇是中國經濟的一環，但因揷上了一支不同的國旗，事齊事齊，左右爲　，這才是香港商人眞正苦悶的所在。</p>

<p>三月十二日爲總理逝世紀念日，本埠國民黨同志會邀請各僑團舉行紀念會，各商店住宅均升懸國旗，表示紀念，不意印尼極端份子（國民軍與靑年團）表示不滿，揚言如不降旗，即將動武。幸賴僑長與華僑總會諸領袖據理交涉，並經華僑及印尼政府之臨時聯席會議完滿解決。然印尼國民軍及靑年團，平素仇視華僑，蓄意肇事，竟率領部隊至各商店强迫降旗，甚或以指揮刀砍斷旗桿，或以刺刀刺穿國旗，並似借郡長名義，邀謂僑長，乘機將其刺斃於途，同時包圍中華公學，（當時有數百學生正在開紀念會，）繼而率領五六十人持挾武器，由工部局長指揮，開始沿途縱火，焚我僑民房屋，大有陷全僑之生命財產於一炬之槪。同僑以事至最後關頭，忍無可忍，立即發動械鬥，結果該批極端份子，不敵而退出市區。我僑房屋被燬三座，印尼方面死傷數十人，我方死傷各一。華僑總會以事熊嚴重，組織保衛團，內分參謀部·指揮部·供應部·傳達部·消防部·救護部等等，全埠二萬五千名華僑中，除老弱及婦女外，動員人數達數千人之多，嚴密防守華人區各街道及海口沿岸，電燈廠及碼頭亦由華人扼守，打鐵店日夜趕造武器（長矛與大刀）以增實力。各地印尼暴徒聞訊，（電報局在印尼手），相繼來援，然非淪俘虜，即遭驟退。蓋華僑以屢被壓迫與侮辱，故聞警勇往直前，絕不畏縮，相持達五晝夜。幸印尼郡長及警察保持中立，向雙方提議劃設緩衝區，由鑵察駐守，而廖州州長聞訊，恐事態不可收拾，急派北干答汝分州長曁各部長官，聯同該地華僑領袖多人，到埠調解，由華僑總會提出四項要求：（一）懲辦殺害僑長及放火之主謀及兇犯。（二）不得干涉華人升掛國旗。（三）治安由警察維持，國民軍不得干涉華人之行動。（四）保證此後華僑生命財產之安全。印尼當局自知理屬，且認識華人民氣旺盛，實力雄厚，四項要求，全部接受。乃於三月十七日上午十二時，簽訂和平條約，目下已逐漸恢復當態中。惟同僑以印尼人反覆無常，和平條約雖已簽訂，亦　　戒備，以防不測。査此次動員之經費，如糧食及應用品等，計達　幣（星加坡幣）三萬元。以上折算國幣將近三千萬元。若連全埠一切事業停頓之損失計算在內，則損失當在國幣一萬萬左右。然印尼極端份子經此回之慘敗，當可認識華僑之偉大力量，而不敢有所妄動。而峇眼亞比華僑此種武裝自衛及精誠團結之精神，已在南洋全境獲得光榮之美譽矣。按此次日本之突然投降，致聯軍接收工作十分遲緩，而荷闌因本國亦破碎不堪，故對荷印之接收工作，未能從速進行，致使荷印之印尼民族高揭紅自之獨立旗幟，其最初目標專認荷蘭爲敵人，對華僑頗表好惑，而同僑在原則上亦不反對印尼之獨立運動，然因多數之印尼靑年，均參加獨立運動，整日高呼獨立口號，而對生產工作全部放棄，馴至坐食山空。目鋻華僑之刻苦耐勞，物資豐富，於是苛捐雜稅，相繼而來，然因物價高昻，仍不足供其揮霍，進而搶刦·綁架·殘殺·派捐之非法舉動，層出不窮，因而各地華僑之生命財產，毫無保障，惟有忍氣呑聲，聽天由命。勝利後，中國雖號稱四强之一，荷印各地華僑多不能自由升掛靑天白日旗，豈不可嘆！惟峇眼亞比一地，因華僑人數超過印尼人，且團結一致，印尼當局亦易眼看待，故峇眼華僑之行動，可謂全荷印中最自由者。</p>
<p>勝利後，每逢祖國紀念日，全市均飄揚靑天白日國旗，最近印尼國民軍人數增至數百人，而當地印尼靑年亦有靑年團之組織，此　均係毫無紀律之極端派，自認爲實力雄厚，事事壓迫華人，其手段較諸荷蘭與日本尤爲殘酷，同僑心中，積憤已非一日，而此回竟敢侮辱我國旗，殘殺我僑長，焚燒我房屋，無怪同僑羣起反抗也。設此次事件若非印尼警長（與華僑感情最融治）處理得法，則雙方死傷當以千計，誠不幸中之大幸也。</p>
<h3 id="c79">搶修錢江海塘　預防秋潮泛濫成災 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 十八日杭州通訊　特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>這具有悠久歷史的錢江海塘，它保障了江南千百萬的生命，也可能影響到江南的富庶。回溯歷史，遠在南宋的時候，海塘也有傾圯之處，當時有個錢繆，他奔走努力，結果修成一條堅固的海塘，今天西湖旁的錢王同，就是紀念這位為民造福的功人的。</p>
<p>從南宋以迄於現在，這其問雖也有人發動修理，但沒有傾圮之虞的嚴重性。記得民國十八年的時候，浙省民政廳長朱家驊，曾計劃用科學方法來興修海塘，請奧國工程師白浪滔設計實施過。</p>
<p>敵偽留下惡果</p>
<p>抗戰開始，江南淪於敵手，敵偽根本沒有心去顧算海塘。這八年來，使海塘險象環生，有崩塌之虞。這實是敵偽留下的惡果。</p>
<p>海塘是從杭州起一直到海寗，再由海寗。海鹽延伸到乍浦，長約二百公里。它本身是個堅固的石塘，石塘外面是柴塘，柴塘外面是沙灘，沙灘外面又是淺的沙灘。石塘裏面，就是富庶的江南，江南的地勢低於海面，所以全賴海塘保護，如果沒有海塘，則江南富庶的區域，就是汪洋大海了。這裏所說的江南，是包括杭·嘉·湖·蘇·松·泰六屬，影響到蘇浙兩省的人民生計。</p>
<p>據海塘北岸搶修委員會王任顧達一說：海寗的塔基，以水平綫看起來，就是等於鎭江金山的塔頂。由此，我們可知在海塘保護下的各縣地勢的低暹了。</p>
<p>錢江有兩岸：北岸，即杭州到海寗·海鹽一帶，南岸即蕭山紹興一帶。蕭山·紹興·也是富庶之區，但她們也全賴南岸的海塘護衛着。</p>
<p>現在海塘頽壤之處，不僅北岸一處，而是好多處，也不僅北岸，而是南岸也在內。</p>
<p>浙江省的主席沈鴻烈，下車伊始，就到海寗去視察海塘。在沈主席沒有視察前，杭州市參議會的議長羅少秋老先生已去過了。他是在霪雨連綿的時候去的，他曾經吿訴記者，那時石塘以外的淺沙難已沒有了，高沙灘上的公路也將湮沒了。以他看起來，大槪石塘距水僅二三十里。待在潮來時，很容易立刻沖到石塘上的。</p>
<p>海塘分堡，從一堡起至八堡以上。每堡內又分字號，如「天。地·元·黃·」「宇。宙。洪·荒·」等字號編列，經常有少數修理工人管理，如某堡某字號發生不固時，即可發動臨時工人動手修理。</p>
<p>沈主席是到海寗去的，他一直到八堡，那裹「營桓公框」四個字號塘，有一缺口，長達五十公尺，海水已經浸侵到了麥田了。據當地人民講；前幾天，下大雨的時候，滬杭公路湮沒了，一千多斤重的鐵牛也翻了個身。</p>
<p>這「營桓公框」是面對尖山海口的，所以潮來時以此處爲最激烈。南岸蕭山海塘，也有八十公尺的缺口，不過蕭山的嚴重性，較輕於「營桓公框」。</p>
<p>循「營桓公框」而上，看見一排新式的碼頭建築，從水面起，有二三十級石級，這就是奧國工程師白浪滔的成績。當地人民叫它做斜坡塘，據說是最科學的防潮建築。再由斜坡塘前進，到「杜藥鍾隸」四個字號的塘，那裏石塘已頽壞二百公尺，柴塘也早已霉爛了。如果秋潮來時，向此處湧進，可能淹沒嘉興，吳興一帶。</p>
<p>據工程處人員講：「第一步搶修工程，就要四十萬萬的物資，二十萬萬的工資，而中央發下的僅五千六百萬元，善後分署以工代賑的麵粉，僅供給「社藥鍾隸」」。</p>
<p>負起搶修責任</p>
<p>據其他人講：自從開始感覺海塘有傾圮可能起，一直到現在止，大概有四五個月了。但是很多工程人員都埋頭在計劃之中，有的說洋灰新型建築，有的說還是柴塘與石塘。今天你畫一張圖樣，明天他畫一張圖樣，一直到現在，還是很少有計劃的動工。今天這裏稍加修理，明天那裏稍加動手，而殘酷的時間不等我們了，轉瞬秋潮就到，那時洶湧的浪潮，將不客氣的來淹沒我們富庶的兩岸。所以沈主席隨即指示：「搶修海塘是整個的事，不能分南岸北岸，更不能修了海寗，不修海鹽。工程計劃，必須三天內趕好，整個工程，必須在七月十五日秋潮泛濫前完成」。</p>
<p>沈氏指示後，就回杭州來了。當登車回來時，我們眞有無限的感慨。</p>
<p>我們熱切的盼望「計劃不在多」，而「工作要實際」。我們要求蘇浙兩省人民密切的注意這椿修海瑭的事，大家起米，監督政府迅速實施。</p>
<p>我相信眞正為民衆的，民衆是不會忘記的，請看西湖傍的「錢王祠」吧！（四月十八夜寄自杭州）。</p>

<p>— 敬明</p>
<p>峨眉天下名山，靈秀所鍾，用以辦學，正合中國人的脾胃，雖然以寺廟改裝的校舍，談不到堂皇富麗，在程校長的積極經營之下，學生人數逐年增加，院系時有增設，文科硏究所及師範學院也在三十一年增設成立。外間的人，也許很羨慕川大的師生能够得天獨厚，於講學求智中，可以飽餐山光水色，而事實却剛剛相反。究竟大學和從前的學院不同，他們需要多多呼吸自由空氣，需要交通方便和城市生活的調劑，而在峨眉要三五天以後，纔能看得到成都的報紙，一年中難得看幾天像樣的太陽，物價一天比一天高起來，師生的質養跟着一天比一天壞下去，瘧疾和其他種疾病逐漸蔓延起來。於是以前欣賞風景的心情，現在變成了厭惡的對象了。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形下，正當三十二年一月程校長奉命調長中央政治學校的敎育長，遣缺由中央簡派現任校長黃季陸先生接任，這是一個相當煩重的課題，當黃校長前往接事時，學生情緒惡劣，敎授不齊，課程無法全開。需要有斷然的措置，他歸納大部分敎職員和學生的意見，認定不遷回成都，一切問題都無法解決。但搬遷一個大學不是很容易的事情，千餘學生，數百敎職員及其眷屬，儀器，圖書，用具，重量是要以噸來計算的。由成都至峨眉是順水，而峨眉至成都是逆流。這是一個難題。皇城的校舍是燬壞了，望江樓的校舍沒有完成，而且全部都由農學院使用着。這一千餘人把他安頓到那裏去？又是一個難題。搬遷要一筆經費，修葺和建築新校舍，又要一筆經費，款從何來？也是一個難題。然而要做的事終於做了，二月初間始遷校，至三月中旬工作完成。事後一想簡直不敢相信這是可能的事情。</p>

<p>本市米價，自米貨開始以後，突然猛漲，殊出一般意料之外，頗引起各万注意，連日市府當局亦在續密探討，剴切督導，但僅前日稍見回落，昨又繼續挺進，言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，因此輿論大譯，一致主張嚴懲，取締非法交易，並將米糧不論高次各貨，一律集中市塲交易，蓋米糧存底並未稱减，只因大宗食糧操諸非業中大戶，據悉各銀行堆棧均　有大批食米，况大批食米甫在運滬途中，民食供應前途，何虞匱乏，過去米商往往以黃金領先漲價，民生日用品價昂爲藉口，然目今金市既吿穩定，民生日用品正在頻頻下落中，米價竟起熾烈漲風，故衆以米價之上漲，純係受投機者作衆所致，如米市漲風不再及時撲滅，則後患息如何，殊難逆料。</p>
<p>昨日各糧均在高峯挺進之中，米市以各產地均昂，人心堅固，價漲千餘元，麵粉零化活潑，價格盤升七八百元，形成步步高翔，油市以消化轉活，回漲二三千元，黃豆再加六七百元，赤豆因呂宋香港動辦，續漲千餘元，黃豆南洋消路動而不旺，市勢提高殺次，生仁到消兩平，豆餅亦隨各物上升，再漲三百元，麩皮納戶甚殷，再加二百元，惟棉餅則燃料機器多用柴油，去化呆滯，價疲三四百元，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白粳等六種，共三千八百餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳一九九七石，薄稽五九五石，早稽七七五石，羊稽二〇石，社稽一八〇石，白元五四石。</p>
<p>（中央社本市訊）本市糧政當局舉辦第一期糧商貸款，由中國銀行承辦以來，各糧商分赴產米區域採購，據悉內中新昌，協昌寨等已將第一批貸款採購貪米，由附近各地陸續運到，約有一千餘担，在下星期一准可應市。</p>

<p>烚赤昨高價仍難持久，美鈔昂後回落，金市孤掌難鳴，高價時壓力重重，買氣復受打擊，査晨開在一六〇萬關邊，美鈔奇俏，套頭軋攏至六七〇元對十兩，金價被迫隨漲至一六二萬五，逢高某種壓力頻仍，金價未免遜色，漲後盤旋，中行登記時市價在一六〇萬光景，同業登記者不多。祇五十三條，十時後市價逐步回落，中行配給價仍未更動，聞登記者以無利可圖，紛吿退貨，午前曾回小至一五七萬左右，而後稍吿平穩，午後投機方面又現疲竭，最後復現低價，惟套買較殷，過程反較美鈔生動，結果較前收回跌三萬五，銀樓飾金掛十七萬，紋銀一千六，銀元微挺，暗拆自一角二分至一角六分。</p>
<h3 id="c96">結滙手續並不困難　正當行商均可申請 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>據中央銀行業務局發言人稱，該局對於合法申請外匯之中外行商結匯事，均照章辦理，進行手續，亦極簡易，凡合理之申請，均已一一照准，外間所傳，申請外匯手續困難，及美匯將提價等，均爲投機者造謠之訛傳，故該行希望一般正當行商需要選口外匯，可依合法手續，逕向各指定經營外匯銀行申請，以免黑市抬高。</p>

<p>昨市人造絲始昂終疲，一二〇號大橋開盤一百四十五萬元，後即盤旋下挫，一百四十一萬元收盤，較隔日短一萬元，廠絲洋行貨無交易，各檔喊價與上日相仿，另攬稍有進出，類皆同行買賣，綢廠迄未開工，絲銷難旺，綢貨市况平穩，交易尙稱不惡，美亞被面上落甚微，大誠格子璧綢最大喊到地三千五百元，四百十元有成交。</p>

<p>昨白紗市穩定逾恒，客銷雖不見多，然價殊堅挺，小型紗仍然缺俏，續升一二萬，雙馬同業買賣，亦做高二萬，細紗及四十二支價站原盤，獨三十二支雙股，因織造廠叩求有人，而紡建已數期未見開賣，故價獨昂六七萬之譜。紡建昨繼續出售呢絨嗶嘰十七種，錦布二十八種，又美墨布十一種，下週一照例售紗。</p>

<p>三四批後之新龍井，日來溫杭兩地到源依然不絕，惟品質蒼老日甚，因此價格方面，雖此前减落，但在客方弛態未露下，市氣殊形平定，陳貨花色，買戶旣一味看跌，復因實銷去化不佳，故胃納迄仍滯頓，而一部份賣主求現心切，鬆售續多，是以形勢猶鮮甦醒，行情仍向下趨，尤以三十四年份頂祁門，每祖竟跌至十六萬元，若興二月前相比，眞不可以道里計，至於珠蘭苿莉等花茶，頃據天津帮消息，不日恐將有復活之象。</p>

<p>美鈔昨上塲買氣續濃，涸竭之鈔市經不起你爭我奪，銀兌業無法應命，將賣買差價儘量拔開，買價愈哄愈高，自二三一〇元步漲至二四三〇元左右，此際金市被中行所阻，套頭軋攏至六七〇元對十兩，引起一般獲利者紛紛套轉，出鈔換金，美鈔供源轉殷，各洋商銀行亦塞出大量現貨，連漲多日之美鈔，始由飽和點轉起跌風，迨後結款暫時停止，投機帮手中實貨稍感恐慌，午前回挫至二二〇〇元關邊，午刻在二二五〇元左右縱旋，午後再吿不支，重復退至二三〇〇元關邊，結果較前收回跌一百元，持鈔者經此利誘後，紛起套轉，套頭最後又拔開至七一〇元對十兩左右，港票經過一度爭買，曾見四二五元高價，而後隨大勢稍回，結果新老均平，羅比港電仍站原價，美匯掛脾雖平，指定銀行對做升爲二〇五〇元至二〇六〇元。</p>

<p>產區</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前華商烟廠需用之菸葉，除選用自美洲輸入之佛及尼菸葉外，大部份採購國產美種屬菸。</p>
<p>豫省許昌，皖省鳳陽，魯省靑州等地所產，均甚著名，而尤以許昌之品實爲最　，產量亦最多，是以許昌菸市。　然號稱中國之佛及尼也。</p>
<p>試種</p>
<p>許昌菸葉之發　，始於民初，英美烟公司指導農民，在許昌，城西頴河流域試種，成績甚好，厥後南洋烟公司亦派人來此散發菸籽，歷年來佈種者日多，菸田擴展至襄，禹，郊，葉，方城，魯山，長葛臨頴等縣境，每年可輸出境菸葉約三十萬包以上，（每包重二百斤）該兩公司在許昌西關，各設有烤菸葉廠，用四法機器烤藏，規模相當宏大，不幸英美烤菸廠，在民國十七年，燬於兵災，頗予華商烟廠以進展機會，紛紛自由向產地採購，至菸農方面，因收購者衆，提高賣價，收益增厚，從而刺激產量。</p>
<p>改良但農民</p>
<p>但農民皆墨守舊法，不知改良，品質漸低，民國廿一年，上海華商烟廠公會主席郞挺生，曾條陳稅政當局，組織許昌美種菸葉改良委員會，並到許主持改良事宜，除向美洲購運美菸種耔，發給該地農民換種外，並在許昌北關，關地研究培植選種之法，其他如施肥及炕房之改善，亦積極推行，頗有供戲，惜於廿三年冬，遭狙殞命，翌年冬，美籍顧間牛森亦被匪從槍殺，致改良事宜，因此停頓，經過八年抗戰，菸葉品質，每况愈下，戰後經濟建設，改良許昌美種菸葉，亦復興農村之一要政也。</p>

<p>— 羅振之</p>
<p>崑班笛師，造就甚難，每劇有連套之曲牌，每曲有合韻之宮譜，即兩劇相同之步步嬌，其曲文襯字多少不等，而平仄工尺，頓逗起迄，皆非一定，若呆滯刻板，千遍一律，不成藝術矣，故一師之腹，非有數十折曲本可背，不能登壇　笛，若一味翻謂，終覺不便，而其昔節板眼，易致失貫，抗戰以來，拍師陳鳳鳴。沈三明，相繼辭世，鳳鳴崑班出身，習巾生，孤芳自賞，韓世昌南來，曾與之討論曲藝，極爲祟懇，三明海寗藉，本姓糜，贅於沈，幼孤寒，自甘刻苦，硤右布莊主沈某，見而憐之，乃培植爲笛師，賦性耿直，重義好勝，曲期彩排，往往連吹二三十折不少息，竟至傷肺咯血，旣歿蕭條，一子未冠，由沈某設法覓業，可謂周卹至再，近者後起無人，僅仙　一班伶人，奔馳授曲，以良工値微薄，汲深綆短，竟成淡然秋水對斜暉之象。</p>
<p>曲中賓白，問有詩詞，或開塲先念七言四句，雖無工尺可依，但須先明節奏，平聲延長，上聲揭高，去聲低遠，入聲快斷，一方面顧全文理，融會體貼，方能傳出曲中神情，乃自歐風東漸，四方人集，普通記載，改行白話，口頭所述，通用國語，若以文字代語言，惟知音者尙樂聽，局外人聞之如嚼蠟耳。</p>
<p>崑伶尙重戲德，班中縣牌，不究高下，排戲先後，無分階級，出塲門帘，伶工自撩，近因海上接近京派，此風已稍稍變易，然平日曲友集唱，輪流排戲，必先恭敬摯誠，預邀陪唱，旣畢拱手言謝，蓋感其陪座對答，得免隕越之虞，如遇新唱者，臨時插入，一般舊友退而爲陪唱，表示親切同好，是誠誰謙君子，有揖讓之風焉。</p>
<p>冠生有大小之分，見娘，喬酷，年少翩翩，風流縕藉，廊會，書館，爲大冠生，說白冗長，詩歌相間，旦角以佳期，思凡，遊園，驚夢，斷橋，水鬥，爲最通行，所謂熱門戲也，梅蘭芳演遊園，朱傳茗爲配，演驚夢，姜妙香僞配，恰可合當，吹笛者稱笛王，如近俚俗，將來梅劇團之琴師，亦可稱爲琴王，然而王者封建之謂，可與海上湯　大王相映成趣，又不禁爲崑曲家太息。</p>

<p>據頃自甘寗靑等省視察歸之某氏談：西北爲我國文化發源地，但今日之文化水準却甚低落，尤其關於科學化之電影事業，更加落後，電影院亦不普遍，設備簡陋，但營業却頗盛，古裝國產影片特別受觀衆歡迎。可見西北人士對於電影極感興趣云。</p>

<p>— 梁</p>
<p>秦怡，這個名字在上海人還很陌生吧。八一三抗戰爆發時，她還很小，便匆匆隨演劇隊到內地去了。她在重慶以演「野玫瑰」一劇而轟動了山城的觀衆，雖然這個戲不是她的得意之作。似乎在大地回春和巡按等劇中有更好的演技。在電影上因爲後方器材困難她沒有得到較多機會。</p>
<p>她是世居上海的本地人，可是說得一口流利的國語。她有極良好的開末拉瞼和健美的體格，極適宜於演影劇。</p>
<p>她對電影有深刻的理解，她欣賞力甚高。</p>
<p>她態度看上去很溫柔，談話像做詩一般，可是性格却很强。</p>
<p>最近她自後方吃盡辛苦由陸路繞道永路返鄕來滬，參加中電二廠吳永剛編導之「忠義之家」的攝製，飾演一個戰時的少婦，現在每天在二廠的攝影棚裏工作。</p>
<p>她特別喜歡「忠勇之家」中的葛麗亞加蓀，我們可以預料「忠義之家」中的秦怡必有驚人的藝術成就。</p>

<p>— 苓</p>
<p>莎樂美，原文名Sald　meWhere　She　anced，並非根據唯美派大師王爾德的名著莎樂美改編的。這張影片，不過是好萊塢製片家，在拍了許多瑪麗亞蒙坦斯的天方故事之後的一個新噱頭。瑪麗亞蒙坦斯因其美麗而被好萊塢的製片家發掘出來，拍了許多天方故事的絢麗的誘人的五彩影片，顯見得蒙坦斯與天方故事將至最後階段了。這被宣傳爲自二萬名美女中選出的美人伊鳳黛卡珞被好萊塢的製片家發掘出來了，而以一個煊奇的故事給她串演，這與瑪麗亞蒙坦斯所演的一些大方故事片是同出一轍的。</p>
<p>「莎樂美」的本事是寫一八六五年美國南北戰事結東後，普奧戰事時，一個奧國的名舞女莎樂美，因有偸漏軍情之罪嫌，由一美國新聞記者救出潛逃，而與一個英勇的年靑强盜戀愛因而演成的一串浪漫史。</p>
<p>這裏有情殺，戰爭，俠盜，鬥劍，音樂，戀愛塲面，誘人的跳舞，宮庭，以至生硬地穿插進一個中國老頭，中國船，中國擺設，和中國音樂等。由於這些，便更增加了彩色片的用武之地。</p>
<p>黛卡珞的確美麗，不在蒙坦斯之下，而其跳舞尤為動人，「莎樂美」是她的第一部主演的影片。以後陶樂珊拉姆和瑪麗亞蒙坦斯所能飾演的一類影片，將又添了這位伊鳳黛卡珞來飾演了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in the Northeast Becomes Increasingly Serious; Reception Personnel from Harbin Return to Shenyang; Intense Fighting in the Gongzhuling Area <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] Forty Harbin government reception personnel, forced by circumstances, all flew back to Shenyang on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] Xinhua News Agency reports: After the Communist army captured Changchun, it captured about 10,000 members of the Changchun Security Team and police. Five Americans in Changchun are safe, but the whereabouts of the government reception personnel were not mentioned.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Ping Dispatch: The American news office in Beiping sent a plane to Changchun today, attempting to rescue the five American reporters stranded in Changchun. However, because the Changchun airport was already in the hands of the Communist army, the plane could not land and returned to Beiping empty.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 19th] The semi-official circles in the Northeast here do not express surprise at the rapid subsidence of the battle for Changchun. It is said that Xiong Shihui ordered them to hold out for a week, waiting for reinforcements to arrive, but the weakness of the defending forces was indeed a fact.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang Dispatch on the 20th] Yesterday (the 19th), two planes flew from Harbin to Shenyang, carrying more than 40 central and local personnel, including Ma Zhongliang of the various reception departments, Shen Songzhou, the director of the Harbin Postal Administration, and many staff members, as well as some personnel from the Harbin Municipal Government. According to them, when they left Harbin, the Communist army in the urban area of Harbin could not openly operate, and the people's hearts were still calm, but the suburbs were very tense.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the fall of Changchun into the hands of the Communist army was confirmed yesterday, people here felt deeply saddened. In addition to expressing respect for the security forces who fought hard for many days, they were deeply concerned about the reception personnel from the central government and all the citizens who remained in Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] One hour after the government spokesperson declared that the situation in the Northeast was "very serious," the spokesperson of the Communist Party office declared that if the Northeast remained in a state of civil war, the Communist army would occupy Harbin on the 25th of this month after the Soviet army withdrew. As far as the government is concerned, the fall of Changchun will subject the National army moving north along the Shenyang-Changchun railway line to significant pressure from the Communist army. According to the government spokesperson, strong units of the Communist army have been heavily concentrated near Harbin and elsewhere, and a large number of irregular troops have infiltrated the city. There are no National troops stationed in Harbin except for the government and local officials, and the government may not intend to defend the city. When the Communist military spokesperson gave a speech, he pointed to a huge map of China and said that the area controlled by the government stretched from Liaodong Bay to north of Siping Street and Guojadian, forming a slender wedge occupying one-eighth of the entire Northeast. Both the government and the Communist Party admitted that the National army moving north had taken small roads to cross Siping Street and detoured forward.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] It is reported that in addition to the National army's 3,000 soldiers in Changchun city, there are more than 100 government reception officials. There were three fierce battles in the Northeast today: (1) In the Gongzhuling area, 35 miles south of Changchun, the National army is fiercely attacking, trying to break through the Communist army's defense line and recapture Changchun; (2) In the area between Fushun, a strong stronghold of the National army, and Benxihu, a strong stronghold of the Communist army; (3) Near Liaoyang, it is reported that the Communist army is counterattacking.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] The Communist army in Hebei is becoming increasingly active. The Dingbei Guerrilla Brigade of the Communist army, with 250 soldiers, attacked the Ding County station, police station, and branch office at 2:00 AM last night. After a fierce battle of 40 minutes, the Communist army retreated westward. At the same time, the Communist army near Baoding is frequently moving, building fortifications, digging trenches, and prohibiting pedestrians from passing, attempting to block the Pinghan Road's supplies. The local Communist army convened a propaganda meeting for cadres yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] The Commander of the North American Marine Corps stationed in China, Lieutenant General Rockey, announced this morning that if the American military encounters danger while performing road and railway repair duties, it will retaliate. He also stated that American soldiers and sailors were shot at near Qinhuangdao on the 2nd of this month. One sailor was shot and fell into a ditch and died. The perpetrators fled on horseback afterward, and their identities are unknown.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch on the 20th] It was just learned from the headquarters here that since the 14th, planes flying to Zhongyang and Wenxi to drop wheat to the besieged cities have been repeatedly shot at by the Communist army. On the 17th, when a food-dropping plane flew to Wenxi, it was fiercely shot at by the local Communist army and was hit in two places, one in the middle of the fuselage window and the other near the left wing fuel tank. The relevant authorities have reported this illegal behavior of the Communist army for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Yan'an American Observation Group Has Been Ordered to Conclude Its Mission <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] The American military observation group in Yan'an, belonging to the U.S. military headquarters in China, has been ordered to conclude its mission. The head of the group, Colonel Heaton, has also come to Shanghai to take charge of intelligence work for the U.S. military. The China Theater Command is scheduled to end on May 1st, and the group will also be withdrawn accordingly. There is no political background involved, and the U.S.'s mediation position between the Nationalists and Communists will not be changed as a result. In the future, liaison with Yan'an will be handled by the Beiping Military Mediation Execution Department, which will send a delegation to Yan'an three times a month. It is not yet known whether the Military Mediation Department will send personnel to be permanently stationed in Yan'an, but Yan'an's relationship with the outside world will still be able to maintain close contact through airplanes and radio communication.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Subcommittee Continues to Discuss the Draft Constitution <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] The drafting subcommittee of the Constitution Review Committee met today and continued to discuss the draft constitution. After the death of Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian, representatives of the Communist Party in the CPPCC, Luo Mai was sent to Chongqing to represent the negotiations. Luo Mai arrived in Chongqing yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] The CPPCC Constitution Subcommittee met twice today, hoping to quickly resolve the issue and enable the government to complete its reorganization as soon as possible before the end of this month. The main topic of discussion was whether the Legislative Yuan should exercise its power to manage the Executive Yuan, as requested by the Communist Party and the Democratic League. The government requested a cabinet responsible to the chairman, replacing the British parliamentary cabinet system. The new Communist Party representative Luo Mai has arrived here from Yan'an to replace the current Communist Party representative in the group. Luo Mai is a member of the Communist Party Central Committee and the Secretary-General of the Border Region Government. Representatives of the various parties held consultations today on the number of members of the National Government Committee. It is reported that the Communist Party insists on requesting ten seats, plus the Democratic League's four seats, to obtain a veto power, while the Kuomintang still insists that the Communist Party should occupy eight seats, and other minor parties should each occupy four seats.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi said in a speech today that although the equipment of the Communist army is equal to that of the National army, they are only accustomed to guerrilla tactics. If there are no other complex reasons mixed in, the Northeast issue will not have any decisive impact. The nine eastern provinces are not within the scope of the truce agreement, but the representatives of the three-person group have been to the Northeast and may include them in the scope of the agreement. The government military authorities will pay attention to promoting military science after the military reorganization, such as researching weapons similar to atomic bombs, etc., but at present, the conditions for the scientificization of the army are not sufficient. The military reorganization work is currently being implemented rapidly. It is believed that within a year and a half, the army can be reduced to 90 divisions, and finally to 60 divisions. The military reorganization work focuses on improving the quality of soldiers and reducing the military budget. According to the future conscription law, all citizens of the Republic of China who are 18 years old will be included in the national reserve army, and those who are 20 years old will serve in the military for two years.</p>

<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] In order to emphasize overseas Chinese education, the Executive Yuan recently decided to allocate more than one million U.S. dollars to be used as funds for the repatriation of overseas Chinese education in Southeast Asia.

Currently, our embassy in the United Kingdom is negotiating with the British side.

This matter is also being handled by the relevant authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Lives of Major Traitors in Beiping Prison; Eating Cornbread, Reading Novels, Giving Each Other Nicknames; Hebei High Court Actively Preparing for Trials <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 20th] The major traitors captured in Beiping and Tianjin have not yet been sent to the court, and the ones being inspected and tried by the court are only minor traitors of the third rate. Therefore, various rumors are circulating outside, saying that the major traitors are being delayed in being sent to the court because the people handling the matter are taking bribes, intending to release them on pretexts before they are sent to the court. For this reason, the Beiping Provisional Headquarters recently issued an announcement allowing secret accusations and denunciations, and executed two people. Recently, it has been repeatedly heard that the major traitors will soon be sent to the court and that about ten of the top ones, such as Wang Yintai and Wang Yitang, will be sent to Beijing for centralized trials, but this has not been confirmed by relevant parties. Qi Xieyuan and the other five people detained in Tianjin were escorted to Beiping in the past two days. Qi and other heads of the puppet army have recently been transferred to the military court for interrogation. The Hebei High Court is actively preparing for the trial of traitors. Hearing passes have been issued. It is said that the investigation procedures before these major traitors were sent to the court have almost ended and have been reported to the highest authorities, so the escort will not be far away. According to unofficial statistics, the number of traitors captured in various parts of North China is 300 in Beiping, 150 in Tianjin, 150 in Jinan, 100 in Qingdao, 100 in Taiyuan, and 200 combined in Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, and Baoding. It is said that the lives of the major traitors who have not been sent to the court are still good. They wake up at 8:00 AM, have three meals a day of cornbread, and live in groups of five or six people in a room. Special major traitors even have a room to themselves. Their families can deliver food every day, and they can buy cigarettes in prison. In addition to chatting, they read lewd novels to relieve their worries or write their defenses. They also give each other nicknames, such as Wang Satay being called a madman, Wang Shijing being called "ten incomplete," Cheng Xixian being called "general of all sides," Leng Jiaji being called a "treacherous merchant," Zou Quansun being called "little unlucky," Song Jie being called "big head," and Yu Jinhe being called "Buddha's foot."</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 20th] After the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against Qin Lianggong, the puppet county magistrate of Wuxi, the High Court has concluded several trials. Yesterday, the 20th, was the date of sentencing. At 2:00 PM, Presiding Judge Lu Jiarui, accompanied by Prosecutor Zhang Weiqing, clerks, and others, sat in the Second Tribunal and brought Qin to the court. After briefly questioning his age and place of origin, Judge Liu stood up and read the main text of the judgment, saying: Su Lianggong colluded with the enemy and conspired to resist his own country, and was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months, and deprivation of civil rights for three years. Qin heard the verdict calmly and was immediately returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e20">It is Rumored that a Decisive Change is Coming to the Overall Domestic Situation; Marshall Begins Work; Consults Again with Aides and U.S. Officials Yesterday <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Communist army has clearly gained an advantage in the Battle of Changchun, and the focus of attention of the people of the country has shifted from the Northeast to Chongqing due to Special Envoy Marshall's audience with Chairman Chiang. The Chinese people unanimously hope that the long-standing Northeast problem can be revived due to Marshall's return to China. According to a reporter from an authoritative government observer who returned to the capital from Chongqing today, the biggest problem between the Nationalists and Communists is the Northeast issue. If this issue can be agreed upon, then the thorough implementation of the ceasefire orders in various places, the election of National Assembly representatives, the participation in the reorganization of the National Government, and other major issues that need to be implemented urgently can all be easily resolved. Although the Northeast issue has formed a painful scene in the Northeast, Marshall's return to Chongqing still offers a glimmer of hope for a political solution. According to reliable sources, the new instructions that Marshall brought back this time seem to strengthen the pressure on the Communist Party. The most obvious point is that after Marshall returned to the country, the U.S. State Department called for the negotiation of a huge loan to China. It was originally intended to be given to the central government after it was reorganized according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but now it has been decided to give it to our National Government immediately. The day after Marshall arrived in Chongqing, he visited President Song Ziwen, which seemed to be related to this matter. From this, we can see the whole picture: Marshall's views on his second visit to China are clearly slightly different from his previous visit. Overly sensitive observers have even begun to recall Ambassador Hurley. According to the authoritative source, this new U.S. policy toward China seems to be predicted daily among Communist Party leaders. It is said that Wang Ruofei, Ye Ting, and their party, who died in the plane crash on their way back to Yan'an, were returning to Mao Zedong to discuss countermeasures based on their observations in Chongqing. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a major decision in Chongqing regarding the overall domestic situation in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] It is reported that General Marshall returned to his residence at the Yiyuan from Chairman Lin's official residence in Linyuan yesterday morning and began working. As of 10:00 PM last night, he had not met with Zhou Enlai, and the Military Three-Person Group meeting had not been held. In the afternoon, around 4:00 PM, he visited Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen to discuss trade for about an hour. At 7:00 PM, he attended the American News Circle's welcome dinner and returned to Yiyuan around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing Dispatch on the 20th] General Marshall today again consulted with his aides and U.S. Embassy officials in order to gather sufficient information before attempting to stop the civil war in the Northeast. Mr. and Mrs. Marshall also had lunch with British Ambassador Sir Horace James Seymour and his wife today.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Bowles to Go to Northeast and Korea to Investigate Soviet Removal of Assets; Bernays Hosts Press Conference to Announce <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 19th] State Department official Bernays told reporters today that UN Reparations Committee U.S. representative Bowles will go to the Far East to investigate Soviet removal of Japanese assets from the Nine Eastern Provinces and Korea. A reporter asked if Bowles would be able to enter Soviet-administered areas of Korea. Bernays replied: At least that is Bowles' mission. The last time Bowles went to the Far East, he wished to enter the Soviet-administered areas of the Nine Eastern Provinces, but was not permitted. Now that the Soviet army has withdrawn from the Northeast, Bowles should have no difficulty on this trip. Bowles' work began months ago, and this return to the Far East will seek to bring it to a conclusion. The Japanese assets removed from the Northeast and Korea have become a point of contention between Washington and Moscow. American authorities say that the Soviet Union has no right to remove industrial equipment, especially in the Nine Eastern Provinces. The Soviet government has ignored U.S. notes on the matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 19th] Authoritative sources told the Associated Press that Bowles estimates the value of industrial equipment removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast to be between U.S. $2 billion and $4 billion.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Bernays said at a press conference today that U.S. reparations representative Bowles has returned to the Far East to complete his investigation. Bowles had been charged with making as complete a report as possible on Japanese assets in the Northeast and Korea, whether already moved or not. The Secretary of State said: This report is extraordinarily important, because China's entire economy depends on the resources of the Northeast, whether raw materials or semi-finished products. Reporters inquired about Bowles' trip to the Far East while questioning Bernays about his discussions with President Truman and Bowles regarding Japanese reparations. Bernays then recounted that Bowles was the U.S. reparations representative in Germany, and was later recommended by the President to Japan, serving in the same capacity. Bernays said that Bowles had been in the Far East for some time, but his investigation was not completed because he could not enter the Northeast. However, he has now returned there so that his work can be completed.</p>

U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Moore also delivered a speech of thanks. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. U.S. Army Major Custer reported on the use of DDT for hygiene around the city, and Lieutenant Colonel Moore reported on natural mosquito control methods. Then, Mayor Ma read out the implementation outline for Nanjing City's Hygiene Movement Week. Subsequently, U.S. Army Colonel Kerstang made a conclusion and review, stating briefly: The birth of the hygiene conference should be credited to Xu Xilin, director of the Hygiene Department of the Army Headquarters, and Lieutenant Colonel Moore. He hoped that officials and civilians would jointly promote the hygiene movement, and that the U.S. military would also provide as much assistance as possible in terms of manpower and technology. Subsequently, U.S. Army technician Gees demonstrated the residual insecticidal efficacy of 5% DDT spraying in the venue. The meeting adjourned at 5:10 p.m.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease in the Military Becomes a Serious Problem</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] Commander-in-Chief He revealed at today's hygiene conference that since the Japanese surrender and the Chinese army's deployment to coastal areas, venereal disease in the army has become a "serious problem." He said that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese army fought continuously in the mountainous areas of the west, and venereal disease was not a problem, because soldiers had relatively few opportunities to contract the disease. Now the situation is different. He expressed his approval of the venereal disease prevention methods used in the Allied forces, and lamented the inappropriateness of China's traditional custom of not discussing this issue openly.</p>

<h3 id="e33">A Reasonable Way to Solve the Housing Shortage—Residential Cooperatives <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongming</p>
<p>I. Causes and Effects of Urban Housing Shortage</p>
<p>"Housing shortage" has become a pandemic. Its content is becoming more complex and its scope is widening. Now, from large cities to small towns, no part of the country is immune to this wave. The only difference lies in the degree. A study of the causes of urban housing shortage reveals the following: (1) The number of existing houses has been greatly reduced due to the destruction of war; (2) Domestic political instability and local disorder have caused people to flee and concentrate in major cities; (3) Rising prices and expensive building materials make it impossible for ordinary people to build; (4) Powerful people arbitrarily occupy houses; (5) Enemy and puppet houses have not been properly allocated. The adverse phenomena and impacts that come with the housing shortage are threefold:</p>
<p>(1) House owners take the opportunity to exploit, sub-landlords benefit from it, raise house prices, and increase rent drastically. Taking Shanghai as an example, the cost of renting a house often requires several or even dozens of gold bars, and rent is mostly calculated in US dollars or British pounds. Such golden buildings and silver pavilions, and illegal extortion, are only frequented by a few wealthy merchants, while ordinary people feel the pain of residential oppression.</p>
<p>(2) Some houses, which were originally only enough for one family to live in, are now crowded with several families. The air is dirty, the noise is loud, and the movement is restricted, which hinders hygiene and affects the health of citizens significantly.</p>
<p>(3) Various business institutions and general public educators, due to the difficulty in finding houses, cannot find a place to live, which leads to frequent anxiety and lack of energy to work. This not only reduces the work efficiency of individuals, but also is a loss to the country and society.</p>
<p>II. Reasonable Solution—Organize Housing Cooperatives</p>
<p>Among all forms of cooperation, housing cooperation is a relatively new one. Its purpose is to build comfortable houses in a cooperative manner, using collective power, so that every member, and even non-members, can obtain a better living environment. China's economy is backward, and people's lives were originally extremely difficult. Recently, they have suffered from the catastrophe of war, and the loss of lives and materials is almost impossible to estimate. However, the most eye-catching loss in various cities is the destruction of general buildings. The government should respond to the needs of the times and urgently build large-scale civilian houses and public dormitories in major cities for civilians to live in. However, because the national treasury is too thin, especially at the beginning of national reconstruction, when everything is waiting to be rebuilt, the government may not be able to do this. However, people cannot live without a place to live for a day. In this situation, we believe that it can only be solved by uniting compatriots with the same needs and organizing housing cooperatives on a large scale. Building a house requires huge construction costs, good construction technology, and consideration of hygiene, safety, transportation and other conditions. These problems cannot be done independently by most people, and must use the power and funds of most people to achieve results. Therefore, in view of China's national conditions, housing cooperation is urgently needed. Its significant functions and advantages are:</p>
<p>(A) Organizing housing cooperatives can gather the power and funds of the group, and jointly build or lease the required houses, and then attach various educational, health, transportation, entertainment and other facilities to cultivate the habit of group life for members.</p>
<p>(B) Use the progressive struggle method of cooperation to eliminate all unreasonable phenomena such as capitalist housing monopoly and speculation.</p>
<p>(C) Based on the principles of equality and mutual assistance in cooperation, apply modern science and technology and construction engineering to build the most useful, beautiful, comfortable and hygienic houses.</p>
<p>III. Several Operating Methods of Housing Cooperatives</p>
<p>There are two ways to solve the housing panic: one is palliative, counting the existing houses and the number of residents, and then allocating them fairly and reasonably. The other is fundamental, actively and quickly building a large number of civilian houses and other buildings to meet the needs of various institutions and the general public. Although there are no statistics on housing in Shanghai, there is no doubt that it is insufficient for use. Therefore, if you want to solve the housing panic in Shanghai and even major cities across the country, seeking a reasonable distribution of existing houses is still ineffective. You must pay attention to the addition of houses to seek a fundamental solution. However, no matter whether it is palliative or fundamental, these two methods can be used by cooperatives as the main body of operation and implemented in a cooperative manner. Here are some proposed operating methods for reference:</p>
<p>(1) For enemy and puppet houses, it is proposed to request the authorities to allocate them to the cooperative in the name of the housing cooperative, so as to make a reasonable distribution, so as to avoid bad phenomena such as competition and forceful occupation.</p>
<p>(2) Citizens pool funds to organize a housing cooperative to build new houses. When necessary, the built houses can be used as collateral, and a part of the construction funds can be raised from financial institutions. The borrowed funds are repaid by the members in installments over a long period of time.</p>
<p>(3) Quickly request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply new-style mobile houses, or directly purchase them in large quantities from the United States to meet the current urgent needs.</p>
<p>IV. Organizational Principles of Housing Cooperation</p>
<p>In addition to following the general principles and methods of cooperatives, the organization of housing cooperatives must pay attention to the following basic principles:</p>
<p>(1) The business of the cooperative is for the welfare of the members, not for profit.</p>
<p>(2) The houses of the housing cooperative are in principle for the use of the members themselves and their direct relatives.</p>
<p>(3) The sale and grant of the ownership or lease right of each house must be submitted to the board of directors for approval in accordance with the regulations, and reported to the members' meeting for record.</p>
<p>(4) The cooperative must implement democratic management, managed by the joining members themselves, one person one vote. It is a combination of people, not a combination of capital.</p>
<p>V. Conclusion</p>
<p>The war is over, but what is left behind is industrial stagnation and currency inflation. In cities, speculation is rampant, and in rural areas, hunger is everywhere. The national clothing, food, housing, transportation, and security are almost all problems. All of this requires the government and the people to take out strong perseverance to overcome together. Only anger and resentment are of no help to the facts. The purpose of this article is to provide some remedy for the housing shortage in Shanghai and other major cities. The author once again appeals, hoping that all sectors of society can understand cooperation, study cooperation, and use cooperation to solve the current serious "housing panic." I do not deny that there are other ways to solve the housing shortage, but in view of the situation, the cooperative method is more suitable for the current stage of China's environment. This is the most reasonable and rapid way to solve the housing problem for Chinese people. I deeply hope that domestic intellectuals and cooperative comrades will give enthusiastic support and promote it universally.</p>

<p>Good News for Refugees in the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway: Over a dozen counties in northeastern Anhui, including Lingbi, Sixian, Tianchang, Xuyi, Lai'an, Chuxian, Jiashan, Dingyuan, Hexian, Hanshan, Quanjiao, and Chaoxian, previously suffered from enemy military destruction, drought, and insect plagues, and recently have been harassed by Communist forces. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. With rice and flour prices soaring and no money to buy food, they are on the verge of starvation. Ye Yuanlong, Director of the Anhui Relief Branch, reported the situation and telegraphed the head office, requesting a large sum of money to set up stations to provide urgent relief. The reply stated that refugees could be repatriated to their hometowns, and those without homes should be employed on work relief projects. The necessary funds should be drawn from the approved operating expenses, with no additional allocation. Director Ye, realizing that the available funds were limited and insufficient, telegraphed the head office again, requesting a large amount of supplies to establish charity food distribution stations in Bengbu, Guzhen, Linhuaiguan, Chuxian, Suxian, and other places to benefit the afflicted people.</p>

<p>Reporting Hidden Guns Leads to Arrest: A man named Wan Jie in Zhongxin Lane in the city, while serving in Yongjia, Zhejiang, became friends with Shen Yiren from Xujiahui, Shanghai. After Wan returned to Songjiang, they lost contact. For some unknown reason, a person identifying themselves as Zhou Weiru reported to the Songjiang County government, claiming that Wan had two handguns hidden. An investigation revealed that this was not true. After comparing the handwriting of the original letter, it was found to be from Shen Yiren. Wan then accused Shen of being the main offender in a robbery case in Hongkou, Shanghai, sending a letter to the Hongkou Police Station as revenge. When Shen was arrested, the interrogation revealed no serious suspicions. The original letter was shown to him, revealing that it was Wan Jie who had written it. Shen then accused Wan of illegally possessing firearms. The police station sent officers to Songjiang and arrested Wan and brought him to Shanghai. They also searched Wan's home but found no firearms. The reason for the feud and the false accusation remains a mystery to outsiders.</p>

The government has taken vigorous measures to export millions of tons of wheat each month, but the American people must sacrifice themselves to save others. If we do not economize on food, millions will starve to death. Therefore, I once again urge all Americans to save bread and conserve fats, which are our most important weapons in the fight against famine abroad. Every American today should pledge to share their surplus food. "The time for talking is over, the time for action has come."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] U.S. President Truman yesterday sent another telegram to Hoover, approving his continued inspection of the world food situation, but urging him to shorten his trip to India and return to the U.S. before May 10th. This was a plan agreed upon by Truman and Hoover during a telephone conversation across the Atlantic yesterday. It is now known that Hoover will inspect India, China, India, Japan, and possibly the Philippines, before returning home before the tenth of next month. It is expected that Hoover will be able to deliver his first report to the American people on May 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Hoover Broadcasts in Cairo, Proposes Six Recommendations to Advocate for 150 Million Hungry People in Europe <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 20th] Hoover, Chairman of President Truman's Famine Committee, broadcast to the American people from here yesterday, appealing on behalf of 150 million hungry people in Europe. Hoover proposed six recommendations as emergency measures: (1) The U.S. government should collect large quantities of food and wheat, exporting an average of 1.1 million tons per month in April, May, June, and July. Americans should also make similar sacrifices in terms of fats. (2) European countries with daily bread rations of more than 300 grams per person should reduce them to 300 grams. However, I am deeply aware that this will increase the burden on countries such as the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, and Yugoslavia. (3) The British have approximately 1 million tons of grain in storage, almost double their pre-war reserves, so it is hoped that they can allocate 500,000 tons to relieve hunger. (4) The U.S., Canada, and Argentina should reduce their exports to South American countries in the next four months, and the generous agreement of these South American countries would be of great value. (5) If the Soviet Union can increase its food supply by 300,000 tons per month in the next four months, it would be a great contribution to humanity. (6) The small countries that have been liberated are suffering the most, and their domestic production is limited, so they should be given priority for assistance. If the above recommendations are adopted, the U.S. will supply 44 percent of the total aid, Canada 20 percent, the UK and Australia approximately 10 percent each, and Argentina and the Soviet Union approximately 12 percent each. Hoover continued, stating that the current world food crisis has a definite time limit and is unprecedented in history. Europe, from the western border of the Soviet Union to the English Channel, has a population of 300 million, of whom only 40 million can maintain their food supply until the autumn harvest. One-third of the remaining population are farmers who will not have food problems. The most miserable are the 150 million city residents who must rely on large-scale supplies from abroad. Furthermore, there are over 20 million malnourished and sick children in Europe today. Children are the foundation of Europe's future and the determining factor for the continent's safety.</p>

<p>Hungry People Struggling on the Brink of Death - UNRRA Director Issues Urgent Appeal</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] LaGuardia broadcast last night, reiterating that the U.S. should make greater efforts to relieve world famine. LaGuardia specifically stated that he was making this broadcast not as UNRRA Director, but as an ordinary American citizen. He said, in short, that if wheat is not immediately shipped to China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Austria, Albania, and other countries within a few days, they will have bread problems. Although the difficult time is long, the situation in the next ninety days is particularly serious. Many people are already struggling on the verge of starvation, and we should do our best to relieve them.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 20th] The second conference of the Allied Council for Japan was held at the Meiji Building the day before yesterday. The situation at the time was full of interesting anecdotes worth reporting: Whenever the U.S. representative made a proposal, China's representative Zhu (Shiming) always said: "I am satisfied." Then the Soviet representative Lavrentiev habitually added: "I want to review the style on this issue. The main purpose is, of course, to ease the recent tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union, because Churchill's speech in the U.S. has already aroused extreme dissatisfaction among their 'Russian friends'." Soviet newspapers have accused U.S. troops of deceiving the Japanese people and claiming that Japan does not have true democracy. In response to this accusation, General MacArthur's representative Whitney rebutted it on the spot, loudly reciting hundreds of thousands of words. The Soviet representative listened attentively, remaining silent. Whitney read out the names of one hundred and thirty-two secret societies one by one! And laughed loudly, saying to the Soviet representative: "If you guys want to know the addresses of these secret societies, I can tell you."</p>
<p>During the meeting, many Allied journalists did not have seats, but Japanese journalists were given the best seats. Some Allied journalists sighed and said: "Japan will not have democracy."</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 19th] The Washington Post published an editorial today titled "Chinese Chairman." It stated: The term of office of China's representative Dr. Guo Taiqi as Chairman of the United Nations Security Council expired on April 17th and was succeeded by Egypt's El-Fifi. If the position of Chairman of the Security Council were elected rather than a rotating position, Dr. Guo would undoubtedly be asked to serve again. The praise of Dr. Guo by representatives from the U.S., France, the Soviet Union, and Poland is not mere courtesy. The work that Dr. Guo undertook was very complex, not only because the various issues in the Security Council are very serious and there are many disputes, but also because the lack of clear procedural rules makes the position of Chairman even more difficult. However, Dr. Guo was able to cope well with his talents. He never looked frightened and handled everything in an orderly manner. He is truly worthy of being a first-class chairman and a model for his successor.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The former Shanghai Housing Management Committee has recently completed its closure, and all unfinished duties are now entirely managed by the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Institutions (office located at the former Deutsche-Asiatische Bank building on Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road). Mayor Qian serves as the chairman, and Peng Xuepei and Huang Boqiao serve as vice-chairmen. The committee's duties are divided into four groups: General Affairs Group, Investigation Group, and Allocation Group. These are jointly managed by personnel from the municipal government, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Japanese Resident Management Committee. The Execution Group is responsible to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. In order to prevent corruption, all staff members of each group are not allowed to meet with outside guests, and only the secretariat receives visitors. All lease agreements signed after April 1 by landlords and new tenants for houses that were previously occupied by enemies or puppets but not owned by them must be approved by the committee to be valid. Yesterday, a person in charge of the committee told reporters: The committee will strive for fairness and speed in handling applications from various institutions for housing allocation. It is expected that the entire task can be completed within one month. As for the current residents, they can temporarily maintain the status quo until the new distribution is approved, and no one may force them to move in under any pretext.</p>
<p>(Further News) The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Board for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region yesterday passed measures to prevent the escape of illegally transferred enemy properties. The main points are: (1) Any sales, leases, or transfers of real estate of Chinese traitors after August 11, 1945, are invalid. The losses of the purchasers or lessees should be negotiated with the Chinese traitors or their families. (2) Once the property rights or lease rights of the traitors are seized, they will be taken over and managed by the Disposal Bureau and entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for leasing. Disposal will take place after the judgment is finalized. (3) For those who leased their houses and land to others before August 11, 1945, the Disposal Bureau should seize and manage the properties, entrust them to the Central Trust Bureau, and notify the original lessees to renew the leases and pay the outstanding rent. In addition, the property rights of the Mingjing Machinery Factory, the storage of manganese carbonate and calcium chloride materials by the American Warner Company, and 12 ships including the Ruisheng and Ruida ships of the Shenjiang Company were approved for return yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Authorities to Return Requisitioned Housing</p>
<p>Chen Shiquan, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, stated: During the Japanese occupation of this city, the enemy and puppets seized a lot of private property. After the takeover, each case was investigated according to the owners' property certificates and returned in a timely manner. As for land requisitioned with compensation by the enemy and puppets, or requisitioned with compensation and then leased back to the owners, if there is no current need, it will still be returned to the owners after settlement based on the prices at the time of the transfer and lease. For example, 700 acres of land in the Longhua area have already been transferred back to the owners following the above procedures. As for real estate currently used for special purposes, such as airfields, farms, and warehouses, appropriate prices will be assessed and requisitioned from the owners. However, as of now, there are still some warehouses and farms occupied by a few institutions that have not yet completed the requisition procedures. The bureau is currently handling them appropriately based on the owners' requests.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Government had contacted the US Foreign Surplus Material Clearance Committee and purchased surplus US Navy ships on a large scale through Customs to restore Customs, port, and lighthouse equipment. It has been learned that the first batch of US Navy surplus ships, the "Pao Xiao" and "Mao Zhua" ships, were transferred to the Customs authorities yesterday.

They are 198 feet long, with a draft of 13 feet, a displacement of 1,200 tons, and are diesel-electric, with a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. The hulls are made of wood to prevent attracting magnetic mines. Each ship normally carries 50 sailors. Both ships are new, having been completed in 1944 and dedicated to laying nets to prevent submarine or torpedo boat attacks on inland river tributaries or ports. The "Mao Zhua" ship served off the coast of Normandy, France, and later participated in the landings in Guam and Okinawa. The "Pao Xiao" ship also came from France to the Far East and will be used by Customs to assist and facilitate the navigation of grain ships. Both ships were docked on the Jiang'an coast of Pudong at the time of the transfer. Those who participated in the handover included Customs General Tax Inspector Li Du, Deputy General Tax Inspector Ding Guitang, Director of the Customs Affairs Department Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Lighthouse Management Office Sapir, US Seventh Fleet representative Xiao Ke, and US Foreign Surplus Material Clearance Committee representative Langerwen.</p>

Over 80 representatives from each district attended, and Li Xuexun, chief of the Civil Affairs Department, explained election laws and election procedures and instructed election officials to adopt a solemn and impartial attitude, as well as matters that should be noted and prepared. The representatives from each district raised difficult questions about handling election affairs on the spot, which Chief Li answered one by one. Instructor Chen Guozhen from the Civil Affairs Department explained the key points to note during voting and vote counting, and the meeting concluded at 12:00. In the afternoon, the same lecture was held from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Each district office is scheduled to hold the above lecture from the 23rd to the 25th of this month, so that all district staff will thoroughly understand everything related to the election. Chief Li Xuexun has written a book titled "The System of Local Public Opinion Organizations" to elaborate on the theory and practice of the electoral systems at the local levels, and it will be published by the Zhonghua Book Company in the near future to promote the importance of public opinion organizations and the close relationship between elected councilors and the rights and interests of citizens.</p>
<p>Contacting Radio Stations to Encourage the Expression of Political Views</p>

<h3 id="e68">China National Aviation Corporation Orders New Aircraft from the United States, Speed Reaching 200 Miles Per Hour, Losses Reaching 1.1 Billion Yuan Last Month <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plans to actively expand its post-war aviation business. According to a company official who spoke to our reporter yesterday, CNAC plans to open routes to the Philippines and Japan, while also increasing domestic routes. However, due to financial constraints, progress has been difficult. The company has already ordered six C54 aircraft from the United States. These aircraft can fly at speeds of over 200 miles per hour and are intended for long-distance routes. They are expected to arrive in China in mid-May. However, the runway at Longhua Airport in Shanghai is covered in gravel and the surface is uneven, making landings and takeoffs for these aircraft very dangerous. Whether it will be possible to use Jiangwan Airport for landings will require extensive negotiations with the U.S. military and other parties. Currently, there is only one international route station in Calcutta. The planned route stations in Japan and surrounding areas are still up in the air due to a shortage of funds and personnel.</p>
<p>Repair and Inspection Require Extensive Labor</p>
<p>The company's existing C47 aircraft can carry approximately 2.5 tons of cargo and require 90 gallons of gasoline per hour of flight, with an additional 50 gallons of oil for each flight. The C46 aircraft can carry approximately 4.5 tons of cargo and require 120 gallons of gasoline per hour, flying at 140 miles per hour. The company has purchased eight C46 aircraft from the U.S. Air Force, which will arrive in succession.</p>
<p>According to the company official, "Although the price of the aircraft is not high, the lack of spare parts and personnel is the biggest difficulty. Each part must be repaired and inspected after each flight. In the United States, each aircraft requires 200 personnel for service, while in China, at least 50 personnel are needed. This complex situation is not as simple as most people imagine."</p>
<p>Flight Attendants Cannot Endure High Altitude</p>
<p>CNAC currently employs approximately 2,000 personnel, including over 50 pilots, including foreign pilots. Due to limited funds, pilot salaries are low, which has led many pilots to resign and seek other employment. The company incurred losses of 110 million yuan in March. Currently, there are approximately 50 aircraft, but only about 20 are actually flying. Flight personnel work extremely hard and require frequent rest. High-altitude flight is detrimental to health, so older flight attendants and others are unable to handle it. Long-distance flights are also beyond their physical capabilities. In short, it will take at least another year and a half to expand to a substantial scale. Regarding the unfortunate occurrence of flight accidents, the Ministry of Communications has ordered that passengers must purchase insurance before traveling. However, most passengers are unwilling to do so. Insurance companies are also reluctant to offer high-value policies. This matter is currently under negotiation. Currently, the company's Chongqing route has one flight per day, averaging three to four aircraft. The Beijing route operates three times per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Hong Kong route operates twice per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. To facilitate cargo transportation, the company has established a cargo acceptance and transportation service at a rate of 4,080 yuan per kilogram. However, due to extremely crowded passenger loads, only a maximum of 3,000 kilograms of cargo can be accepted per day, limited to the Chongqing route for now.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Serving Qi and Serving Chu: A Dilemma! Hong Kong Merchants and Residents Feel Anguish <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong</p>
<p>In my last dispatch, I mentioned the issue of when Hong Kong would return to civilian administration. People in Hong Kong are eager for the return of civilian administration, or to put it more bluntly, they are eager for prosperity to return as soon as possible. People in Hong Kong don't particularly favor either civilian or military administration; they just want a prosperous market and full wallets. As for "politics," the "comprador class" has never been very interested in it.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the number of ocean liners sailing into Hong Kong has increased month by month. American fruits, cosmetics, canned foods, Australian grains, daily necessities, and industrial raw materials have been successively shipped to Hong Kong. Although the quantity is not very sufficient, it is still a "signal" that Hong Kong's foreign trade relations have been rebuilt.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The First Batch of American Loans Stranded in Warehouses <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>At the end of last year, Hong Kong merchants generally felt quite optimistic about the future. They believed that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar had been determined, and British and American ships were arriving in Hong Kong one after another. As long as there was enough money, they could buy enough goods. With goods, there would be a market and profits, and the prosperity of the past would return in an instant.</p>
<p>However, the reality was not as simple as the ideal. The experiences of the past three months have honestly told them that Hong Kong is still far from its goal of prosperity due to various factors. The first thunderbolt for those who were daydreaming was that the first batch of much-anticipated American goods brought in by the President Grant after the war was "stranded" in warehouses by the authorities, who put on a stern face due to "procedural" issues—let's talk slowly.</p>
<p>Difficult to Fulfill Merchants' Aspirations for Loans from Britain and Australia</p>
<p>Merchants sighed as they watched their American goods being sealed in warehouses, while other American goods were being unloaded in Shanghai batch after batch and transported to Hong Kong, with the boundless profits silently flowing into other people's pockets.</p>
<p>They learned a profound lesson.</p>
<p>When they placed orders with London, British manufacturers could not promise when they could load the goods onto ships and transport them to Hong Kong. When they turned to Australia for purchases, the production and shipping in Australia were in short supply, making it impossible to provide large quantities. They tried to make the best of a bad situation, but it was still difficult to fulfill their long-cherished wish, and they had unspeakable bitterness in their hearts!</p>
<p>In the Future, Guangzhou's Market Will Not Be Dominated by Hong Kong Merchants</p>
<p>As a cargo import and export hub, Hong Kong's heyday was in 1937. Goods from mainland China exported through Hong Kong accounted for 34% of the total value. Foreign goods imported into mainland China through Hong Kong accounted for 46% of the total value. Now, not only is there no question of imports to China, but even Hong Kong's local consumption is struggling to cope. Because goods from Shanghai are transported directly to Guangzhou by land and water, even if the opening of Huangpu Port becomes a myth, there is no doubt that Guangzhou's market will no longer be dominated by Hong Kong merchants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hong Kong is also a production center. Before the war, there were over a thousand factories of all sizes in Hong Kong. Due to low labor costs and convenient raw materials, the textile, rubber, flashlight, and paint industries in particular dominated the South China market and even sold overseas.</p>
<p>Raw Materials and Capital Restrain Industrial Vitality</p>
<p>Now, everything is in a state of semi-paralysis. The authorities recently delivered a batch of rubber and cotton yarn to allocate to some factories, but there is not enough for everyone, and it does not help the overall situation. Moreover, the restrictions on the export of raw materials from India and Malaya have not yet been lifted, so even if merchants want to place orders on their own, there is no way. The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting assistance in reviving businesses based on the precedent in Shanghai, but there has been no response. Raw materials and capital are like two big iron clamps, tightly suffocating the vitality of Hong Kong's industry. This is another area where Hong Kong's industrial circles cannot help but envy their counterparts in Shanghai.</p>
<p>What is even more, the Ministry of Finance has recently formally announced that domestic goods that are transferred to Guangzhou through Hong Kong will lose the preferential treatment of domestic sales and will be treated the same as Hong Kong goods, subject to an import tax of more than 20%. It will be difficult for goods from Shanghai to be re-exported through Hong Kong. Recently, goods from Guangzhou that are transported to Hong Kong for export must also go through foreign exchange settlement procedures. Hong Kong merchants are really troubled by this situation.</p>
<p>Changes in the Larger Environment: Hong Kong Loses Its Dominance</p>
<p>After this war, the larger environment outside Hong Kong has really changed too much. Hong Kong's smaller environment is caught in the larger environment and has now lost the dominance of "self-reliance" or "uniqueness" in the past, and is instead restricted by the larger environment. We can say that, as of today, Hong Kong's fate has entered a new track. This new track lies in front of Hong Kong merchants, and they can see it clearly, but they are still a little hesitant, and their golden opportunity is also lost in hesitation.</p>
<p>The ironclad fact is that the driving force of the Hong Kong market is not the pound but the silver dollar, not the Bank of England far across the Atlantic Ocean, but the wealth near the nation's borders. Hong Kong's economy is only a part of China's economy, but because a different national flag has been inserted, serving Qi and serving Chu, being in a dilemma, this is where Hong Kong merchants' true anguish lies.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Bloodstains on Sumatra: Insulting Our National Flag, Killing Our Overseas Chinese Leader, Burning Our Houses <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Correspondent Wei Fu's Dispatch from Bagan Siapiapi, Sumatra</p>
<p>March 12 was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The local Kuomintang comrades association invited various overseas Chinese organizations to hold a memorial meeting. All shops and residences raised the national flag to express their commemoration. Unexpectedly, Indonesian extremist elements (National Army and Youth League) expressed dissatisfaction and threatened to use force if the flags were not lowered. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese leader and the leaders of the Chinese General Association negotiated with reason, and the temporary joint meeting of the Chinese and Indonesian governments resolved the matter satisfactorily. However, the Indonesian National Army and Youth League, who had always hated overseas Chinese and intended to cause trouble, led troops to each shop to forcibly lower the flags, even cutting off flagpoles with command knives or piercing the national flag with bayonets. It seemed that they also invited the overseas Chinese leader in the name of the county magistrate, and took the opportunity to stab him to death on the way. At the same time, they surrounded the Chinese Public School (where hundreds of students were holding a memorial meeting), and then led 50 to 60 people carrying weapons, under the command of the director of the public works bureau, and began to set fire to the houses of our overseas Chinese along the way, almost setting the entire overseas Chinese community's lives and property ablaze. The overseas Chinese community, realizing that the matter had reached the final moment, and being unable to endure it any longer, immediately launched an armed struggle. As a result, the extremist elements were defeated and withdrew from the city. Three of our overseas Chinese houses were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured on the Indonesian side, with one death and one injury on our side. The Chinese General Association, considering the seriousness of the matter, organized a defense corps, divided into staff department, command department, supply department, communications department, fire department, medical department, etc. Among the 25,000 overseas Chinese in the city, excluding the elderly, weak, and women, the number of mobilized people reached several thousand. They strictly guarded the streets of the Chinese district and the coastline. The power plant and wharf were also guarded by the Chinese. Blacksmith shops worked day and night to make weapons (spears and broadswords) to increase their strength. Indonesian thugs from various places heard the news (the telegraph office was in Indonesian hands) and came to assist, but they were either captured or forced to retreat. Because the overseas Chinese had been repeatedly oppressed and insulted, they rushed forward bravely when they heard the alarm and never flinched, holding on for five days and nights. Fortunately, the Indonesian county magistrate and the police maintained neutrality and proposed to both sides to establish a buffer zone, guarded by the police. The Governor of Riau Province heard the news and, fearing that the situation would become uncontrollable, urgently dispatched the Deputy Governor of Pekanbaru and other officials, together with several local overseas Chinese leaders, to the city to mediate. The Chinese General Association put forward four demands: (1) Punish the mastermind and perpetrators who killed the overseas Chinese leader and started the fire. (2) Do not interfere with the Chinese raising the national flag. (3) The police should maintain law and order, and the National Army should not interfere with the actions of the Chinese. (4) Guarantee the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the future. The Indonesian authorities, realizing that they were in the wrong, and recognizing the strong public sentiment and strength of the Chinese, accepted all four demands. A peace treaty was signed at 12:00 noon on March 17, and the situation is gradually returning to normal. However, the overseas Chinese community, because Indonesians are fickle, and although the peace treaty has been signed, is still on guard against unexpected events. The expenses of this mobilization, such as food and supplies, amounted to 30,000 Straits dollars (Singapore dollars). The above translates to nearly 30 million National currency. If the loss of the suspension of all businesses in the city is included, the loss will be around 100 million National currency. However, after this disastrous defeat, the Indonesian extremist elements should be able to recognize the great power of the overseas Chinese and dare not act rashly. The spirit of armed self-defense and solidarity of the overseas Chinese in Bagan Siapiapi has won glorious praise throughout the Nanyang region. The sudden surrender of Japan caused the Allied reception work to be very slow. The Netherlands was also devastated, so the reception work in the Dutch East Indies could not be carried out quickly, causing the Indonesian people of the Dutch East Indies to hoist the red and white flag of independence. Their initial target was exclusively the Dutch, and they were quite friendly to the overseas Chinese. In principle, the overseas Chinese also did not oppose the Indonesian independence movement. However, because the majority of Indonesian youth participated in the independence movement and shouted slogans of independence all day long, they completely abandoned production work, eventually leading to a situation of eating away at their resources. Seeing the overseas Chinese's hard work and abundance of materials, excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees followed one after another. Because prices were high, it was still not enough for them to squander, and illegal acts of robbery, kidnapping, murder, and extortion emerged one after another. As a result, the lives and property of overseas Chinese everywhere had no protection, and they could only endure in silence and resign themselves to fate. After the victory, although China was hailed as one of the four great powers, overseas Chinese in various parts of the Dutch East Indies were often unable to freely raise the blue sky, white sun flag. How lamentable! However, in Bagan Siapiapi, because the number of overseas Chinese exceeded the number of Indonesians, and they were united, the Indonesian authorities treated them differently. Therefore, the actions of the overseas Chinese in Bagan Siapiapi can be said to be the freest in the entire Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>After the victory, the blue sky, white sun flag flew over the city every time there was a national memorial day. Recently, the number of Indonesian National Army soldiers has increased to several hundred, and local Indonesian youth also have a Youth League organization. These are all undisciplined extremists who believe that they have strong strength and oppress the Chinese in everything. Their methods are more cruel than those of the Dutch and Japanese. The resentment that has accumulated in the hearts of the overseas Chinese is not of a single day, and this time they even dared to insult our national flag, kill our overseas Chinese leader, and burn our houses. No wonder the overseas Chinese rose up in resistance. If this incident had not been handled properly by the Indonesian police chief (who had the most harmonious relationship with the overseas Chinese), the number of deaths and injuries on both sides would have been in the thousands. It was a great stroke of good fortune in misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Emergency Repairs to the Qiantang Seawall to Prevent Autumn Tide Disasters <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Correspondent, 18th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>This Qiantang Seawall, with its long history, protects the lives of tens of millions of people in Jiangnan and may also affect the prosperity of Jiangnan. Looking back at history, even in the Southern Song Dynasty, there were places where the seawall collapsed. At that time, a man named Qian Miu worked tirelessly and built a strong seawall. Today, the Qian Wang Temple next to West Lake commemorates this man who benefited the people.</p>
<p>From the Southern Song Dynasty to the present, although some people have initiated repairs, none have been as serious as the threat of collapse. I remember in 1929, Zhu Jia-hua, the head of the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, planned to use scientific methods to build the seawall, and invited Austrian engineer Bailang Tao to design and implement it.</p>
<p>The Evil Consequences Left by the Enemy and Puppets</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance began, Jiangnan fell into the hands of the enemy. The enemy and puppets had no heart to care about the seawall. In these eight years, the seawall has been fraught with dangers and is in danger of collapsing. This is indeed the evil consequence left by the enemy and puppets.</p>
<p>The seawall stretches from Hangzhou to Haining, and then from Haining and Haiyan to Zhapu, about 200 kilometers long. It is a solid stone wall, with a brushwood embankment outside the stone wall, and a sandy beach outside the brushwood embankment, and then a shallow sandy beach outside the sandy beach. Inside the stone wall is the prosperous Jiangnan. The terrain of Jiangnan is lower than the sea level, so it all depends on the protection of the seawall. Without the seawall, the prosperous area of Jiangnan would be a vast ocean. The Jiangnan mentioned here includes the six prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taizhou, affecting the livelihoods of the people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>According to Wang Ren Gu Da, of the North Bank Emergency Repair Committee for the Seawall: the base of the pagoda in Haining, viewed from the horizontal line, is equivalent to the top of Jinshan Pagoda in Zhenjiang. From this, we can know the low terrain of the counties protected by the seawall.</p>
<p>The Qiantang River has two banks: the north bank, from Hangzhou to Haining and Haiyan; and the south bank, around Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. Xiaoshan and Shaoxing are also prosperous areas, but they also depend entirely on the protection of the seawall on the south bank.</p>
<p>At present, there are many places where the seawall is collapsing, not just one place on the north bank, but many places, and not just the north bank, but also the south bank.</p>
<p>Shen Honglie, the chairman of Zhejiang Province, went to Haining to inspect the seawall as soon as he got off the train. Before Chairman Shen's inspection, Mr. Luo Shaoqiu, the speaker of the Hangzhou Municipal Council, had already gone. He went during the continuous rain. He once told reporters that the shallow sand outside the stone wall had disappeared, and the highway on the high sandy beach was about to be submerged. As he saw it, the stone wall was only about twenty or thirty miles away from the water. When the tide comes, it is easy to rush directly onto the stone wall.</p>
<p>The seawall is divided into forts, from Fort One to Fort Eight and above. Each fort is further divided into codes, such as "Heaven, Earth, Origin, Yellow," "Universe, Vast, Flood, Wilderness," etc., which are regularly managed by a small number of repair workers. If a certain fort and code is not secure, temporary workers can be mobilized to repair it.</p>
<p>Chairman Shen went to Haining and went all the way to Fort Eight, where there was a gap in the "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" codes of the embankment, which was 50 meters long, and the sea water had already flooded into the wheat fields. According to local people, a few days ago, when it rained heavily, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway was submerged, and a heavy iron bull weighing more than 1,000 kilograms was overturned.</p>
<p>This "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" faces the Jianshan estuary, so the tide is most violent here. There is also an 80-meter gap in the Xiaoshan seawall on the south bank, but the severity of Xiaoshan is less than that of "Ying Huan Gong Kuang".</p>
<p>Following the "Ying Huan Gong Kuang" upwards, you can see a row of new-style pier buildings, with twenty or thirty stone steps from the water surface. This is the achievement of Austrian engineer Bailang Tao. Local people call it the inclined embankment, which is said to be the most scientific flood defense structure. Going forward from the inclined embankment to the "Du Yao Zhong Li" codes of the embankment, the stone wall there has collapsed 200 meters, and the brushwood embankment has long rotted. If the autumn tide comes and rushes in here, it may submerge Jiaxing and Wuxing areas.</p>
<p>According to engineering staff: "The first step of the emergency repair project requires 400,000 units of materials and 200,000 units of wages, but the central government has only allocated 56 million yuan, and the flour provided by the Post-War Relief Administration for work relief is only supplied to 'She Yao Zhong Li'".</p>
<p>Take Responsibility for Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>According to others: Since the possibility of the seawall collapsing was first felt until now, it has been about four or five months. However, many engineers are buried in planning. Some say reinforced concrete new buildings, others say it is still brushwood embankments and stone walls. Today you draw a blueprint, tomorrow he draws a blueprint, and until now, there is still very little planned construction. Today a little repair is done here, tomorrow a little work is done there, but cruel time does not wait for us. The autumn tide is coming in a blink of an eye, and then the raging tide will unceremoniously come and submerge our prosperous banks. Therefore, Chairman Shen immediately instructed: "The emergency repair of the seawall is a whole matter, not divided into south bank and north bank, and Haining cannot be repaired without Haiyan. The engineering plan must be completed within three days, and the entire project must be completed before the autumn tide floods on July 15."</p>
<p>After Shen's instructions, he returned to Hangzhou. When getting back into the car, we really had unlimited emotions.</p>
<p>We eagerly hope that "there are not many plans" and "the work should be practical". We ask the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to pay close attention to this matter of repairing the seawall, and everyone should rise up and supervise the government to implement it quickly.</p>
<p>I believe that the people will not forget those who truly work for the people. Please look at the Qian Wang Temple next to West Lake! (Sent from Hangzhou on the night of April 18).</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Ministry of Education Invited the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Beijing to a Meeting on the Restoration of Education in Beijing. Middle School Graduates Will Undergo Screening. More Classes Should Be Added for Students Returning to the Capital. <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing News] The Ministry of Education invited the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Nanjing to a meeting at the Ministry of Education on the morning of the 18th to discuss the restoration of education in Beijing. The Vice Minister, Directors, Section Chiefs of the Ministry of Education, and Chen Jianru, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yue Ke, Section Chief, and Gai Dejian, Principal of the Central University Affiliated Middle School, etc. attended. Vice Minister Hang presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Reporting Matters</p>
<p>Chen Jianru reported: The takeover of the former puppet municipal First Middle School, Second Middle School, Vocational School, Normal School, and Jian Shi Five Schools, which were improved and adjusted by the city, and dozens of primary schools, which were changed to central national schools, as well as the takeover of social education institutions. As for private middle schools, eleven schools have been registered. Two or three private middle schools run by the puppet organization still have problems with registration. The screening of faculty and students has been completed. However, the screening of middle school graduates outside the school has been held yesterday. It is planned to assign essay questions to middle school graduates with verifiable records, and to conduct strict examinations of major subjects for students without verifiable records but with diplomas, to prevent skipping grades and abuse. The detailed methods will be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion</p>
<p>The enrollment of children of civil servants returning to the capital from the interior, and the transfer of students returning to their hometowns from national middle schools that did not relocate to the rear, is estimated to be 1,500 middle school students. There are currently a total of 66 classes in municipal middle schools in Beijing, including 3 classes in First Middle School, 16 classes in Second Middle School, 12 classes in Girls' Middle School, 5 classes in Normal School, and 10 classes in Vocational School. According to the situation of each school, the Normal School can expand by 6 classes, and the First Middle School can add 5 classes. The remaining schools are limited by school buildings and cannot add classes. The return of 1,500 people requires 30 classes, an increase of 11 classes, which cannot be accommodated. The Ministry of Education and the Bureau consulted and decided that the Bureau should consult with private middle schools to increase the number of classes to accommodate them. In addition, the Central University Affiliated Middle School had 12 classes of students before the war, and has now expanded to 43 classes. The original school buildings are insufficient, and the Social Affairs Bureau is requested to find a house. (Fool)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Life Education Divided into Three Stages <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi Gave a Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our News] Social educator Tao Xingzhi, who recently arrived in Shanghai from the wartime capital, held a tea party for reporters at 3:00 pm yesterday at Guanshengyuan, 166 Tongfu Road in this city, and gave the following speech: The task of this trip is to promote life education. Life education is divided into three stages: (1) Clearing away illiteracy. We will not only eliminate "literacy illiteracy" but also "cultural illiteracy". (2) Promoting "work-study groups". Work is labor, study is science, and group is group life. We want to "use work to nourish life, study to understand life, and group to protect life". (3) Establishing a "social university". This university is very simple, only needing three conditions: (A) Have scholars with research experience to serve as teachers, (B) Have young people with a high school diploma or equivalent who volunteer to study as students, (C) Teachers and students must have a common goal, which is the "new way of the university," meaning this: The way of the university is to illuminate "people's" virtue, to "love" the people, and to dedicate oneself to "people's welfare." What is called people's welfare, to put it simply, is "fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy." If the world is peaceful, there are books to read, or there is a job, that is fortune. If everyone has food to eat, that is prosperity. Whether it is a clan or a nation, if it can continue from generation to generation, that is longevity. Childbirth, marriage, and other auspicious and congratulatory events are all joy. The opposite of joy is "sorrow." We want the people to be happy and not to be sad. The social university is to achieve the welfare of "fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy" for all people. After Mr. Tao finished his speech, reporters raised questions one after another, which were answered one by one until the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>The first Mayor's Cup football match, held at Yiyuan at 3:00 pm yesterday, featured a championship game between the two Chinese powerhouses, Donghua and Qingbai. The audience was even more crowded, with no less than 30,000 people, and the order was commendable. Minister Zhu Jialian, Mayor Qian, Commander-in-Chief Li, and Chairmen Lan and Wu, etc. all attended the game. As a result of the match, Donghua's offense was extremely strong in the first half, but it did not score any goals. Instead, Qingbai's Fei Chunhua scored first, losing out by 0 to 1. In the second half, although Donghua tried hard to tie the score, Qingbai's Luo Shoufu scored again, and Qingbai finally won. After the game, Commander-in-Chief Li presented the award on the spot. Qingbai's captain Xu Wenkui hugged the brilliant Mayor's Cup and went home in the applause.</p>
<p>Donghua Repeatedly Attacks but Fails to Score</p>
<p>The match started at 3:10 pm, with Zhang Le as the referee. After the start of the match, Donghua immediately took the offensive. In the second minute, Li Zhuang hooked a very good shot, but was forced into a corner kick, which ultimately failed. In the sixth minute, Long Hai received a pass from Li Yao and attacked the goal, but went offside. At this time, Donghua's forwards were very effective, attacking Qingbai in a circle, with more than a dozen scoring opportunities, but they were either saved by Qin Bigao or missed. Donghua repeatedly attacked but failed to score, and misfortune came. In the 25th minute, Gu Yisa got a ball from the backfield, and Li Ning tried to intercept it, but was picked over by Xiao Gu and entered the penalty area. Fei Chunhua then took the opportunity to attack and lightly tapped the ball into the net. Qingbai scored the first goal. Qingbai took the lead 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Qingbai Finally Wins</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides returned to the field. In the eighth minute, Li Yichen had a chance to shoot, but it was caught by Banglun. Donghua survived this difficult situation and suddenly saw a boost. In the tenth minute, Long Hai and Youliang used short passes to get close to the goal about five yards away, and Youliang scored with one tap, forcing a 1-1 tie. The two sides became more fierce and formed a back-and-forth situation. Until the 30th minute, Qingbai launched a major offensive, and A-Kui lofted a high ball, and Luo Shoufu hooked it into the net. Qingbai took the lead again with 2 to 1. After that, although Donghua tried hard to counterattack, Qingbai defended firmly and ultimately failed.

<h3 id="e93">The Sichuan University That Grew Up in the War [From] <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Jingming</p>
<p>Mount Emei is a famous mountain under heaven, a place where spiritual beauty is concentrated. Using it for education is perfectly suited to the Chinese temperament. Although the school buildings, converted from temples, are far from being grand and luxurious, under President Cheng's active management, the number of students has increased year by year, departments have been added from time to time, and the College of Liberal Arts Research Institute and the Normal College were also established in the thirty-first year. Outsiders may be very envious of the teachers and students of Sichuan University for being able to enjoy unique advantages, and while teaching and seeking knowledge, they can feast on the scenery. But the reality is just the opposite. After all, a university is different from a former college. They need to breathe more fresh air, need convenient transportation and the adjustment of urban life. But in Emei, it takes three to five days to see Chengdu's newspapers, and it is rare to see a decent sun for a few days a year. Prices are getting higher day by day, and the quality of life of teachers and students is getting worse day by day. Malaria and other diseases are gradually spreading. Therefore, the mood of appreciating the scenery in the past has now become an object of disgust.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, just as President Cheng was ordered in January of the thirty-second year to be transferred to the position of Education Director of the Central Political School, the vacancy was filled by Mr. Huang Jilu, the current president appointed by the Central Government. This was a rather heavy task. When President Huang went to take over, the students' emotions were bad, the professors were not complete, and the curriculum could not be fully opened. Decisive measures were needed. He summarized the opinions of most of the faculty, staff, and students, and determined that without moving back to Chengdu, all problems could not be solved. But moving a university is not an easy task. More than a thousand students, hundreds of faculty and staff and their families, instruments, books, and equipment - the weight is calculated in tons. The journey from Chengdu to Emei is downstream, while the journey from Emei to Chengdu is upstream. This is a difficult problem. The school buildings in the imperial city were destroyed, and the school buildings in Wangjianglou were not completed, and all of them were used by the Agricultural College. Where to settle these more than a thousand people? This is another difficult problem. Moving requires a sum of money, and repairing and building new school buildings requires another sum of money. Where does the money come from? This is also a difficult problem. However, what had to be done was finally done. The relocation began in early February and the work was completed by mid-March. After thinking about it afterwards, I simply couldn't believe that this was possible.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Under Close Surveillance by the Authorities, Rice Prices Continue to Soar, Followed by Flour and Soybean Oil <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city has suddenly soared since the rice cargo began, which is beyond general expectations and has attracted much attention. The municipal government authorities have also been continuously exploring and earnestly supervising it these days. However, it only slightly declined the day before yesterday, and continued to advance yesterday. Speakers speak earnestly, but listeners do not listen. Therefore, public opinion is greatly translated, and unanimously advocates severe punishment, banning illegal transactions, and concentrating all rice grains, regardless of high or low quality, in the market for trading. The rice reserves have not decreased. It is only because a large amount of food is controlled by large non-industry households. It is reported that major bank warehouses have a large amount of rice stored. Moreover, a large amount of rice is on the way to Shanghai. The future supply of people's food should not be deficient. In the past, rice merchants often took the lead in raising prices with gold as an excuse for high prices of people's daily necessities. But now that the gold market has stabilized, the prices of people's daily necessities are frequently falling. The price of rice has risen sharply. Therefore, everyone believes that the rise in rice prices is purely caused by speculators. If the rice market's price surge is not extinguished in time, the future troubles will be difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Yesterday, all grains were advancing at their peaks. In the rice market, prices rose by more than a thousand yuan due to high prices in all producing areas and strong public confidence. Flour sales were lively and prices rose by seven or eight hundred yuan, forming a step-by-step increase. The oil market rebounded by two or three thousand yuan due to improved digestion. Soybeans increased by another six or seven hundred yuan. Red beans continued to rise by more than a thousand yuan due to purchases from Luzon and Hong Kong. Soybean exports to Nanyang were active but not strong, and the market situation improved slightly. Raw peanuts were balanced between arrival and sales. Soybean cakes also rose with other goods, increasing by another three hundred yuan. Bran was in high demand from households, increasing by another two hundred yuan. However, cotton cakes were sluggish in sales due to the use of diesel for fuel and machinery, and prices fell by three or four hundred yuan. According to rice market information, yesterday a total of more than 3,800 piculs of six types of white rice were received in this city. The types and piculs are as follows: 1,997 piculs of white rice, 595 piculs of thin rice, 775 piculs of early rice, 20 piculs of sheep rice, 180 piculs of community rice, and 54 piculs of white yuan.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, this city) Since the local food administration authorities launched the first phase of loans to grain merchants, which was undertaken by the Bank of China, the grain merchants have gone to rice-producing areas to purchase. It is reported that Xinchang, Xiechangzhai, and other places have transported the first batch of loan purchases from nearby areas, totaling more than 1,000 dan, which can be put on the market next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Under the Control of the Bank of China, Gold Prices Are Not Easy to Move <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's high price of raw gold was difficult to sustain. The US dollar fell after rising. The gold market was unable to support itself alone. There was heavy pressure at high prices, and buying interest was hit again. The morning opened near the 1.6 million mark. The US dollar was extremely popular, and hedging was rolled up to 670 yuan per ten taels. Gold prices were forced to rise to 1.625 million. High-level pressure was frequent, and gold prices inevitably paled. After the rise, the price fluctuated. The market price at the time of registration with the Bank of China was around 1.6 million. Not many colleagues registered, only 53. After 10:00, the market price gradually fell. The allocation price of the Bank of China has not changed. It is said that those who registered gave up their goods because they were unprofitable. Before noon, it had fallen back to around 1.57 million, and then it stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, speculation also appeared to be exhausted, and low prices reappeared in the end. However, hedging purchases were more active. The process was more vivid than the US dollar. As a result, it closed 35,000 lower than the previous day. Silver shops hung 170,000 for gold jewelry, 1,600 for silver, and silver dollars rose slightly. The secret discount ranged from 12 to 16 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Settlement Procedures Are Not Difficult, Legitimate Merchants Can Apply <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, the bureau handles the settlement of foreign exchange for legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants in accordance with regulations, and the procedures are extremely simple. All reasonable applications have been approved one by one. Rumors circulating outside that it is difficult to apply for foreign exchange and that the US exchange rate will increase are false rumors fabricated by speculators. Therefore, the bank hopes that general legitimate merchants who need to purchase foreign exchange can apply directly to the designated foreign exchange banks in accordance with legal procedures to avoid raising the black market.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Rayon Falls by 10,000, Silk Transactions Are Still Good <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for rayon started high and ended weak. No. 120 Dazhigu Bridge opened at 1.45 million yuan, and then fluctuated and fell, closing at 1.41 million yuan, 10,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. There were no transactions for factory silk foreign goods. The shouting prices of various stalls were similar to the previous day. Another small amount of business was done, and most of them were transactions among colleagues. Silk factories have not yet started work, and silk sales are difficult to be strong. The silk market is stable and transactions are still good. The rise and fall of American-Asian bedspreads were very slight. Dachengguan's Gezi Bi silk was shouted to a high of 3,500 yuan, and 410 yuan was transacted.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yarn Prices Are Firm <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's white yarn market was stable and unchanged. Although there were not many customer sales, the prices were very firm. Small yarn was still in short supply, and continued to rise by 120,000. Double Horse colleagues bought and sold, also raising the price by 20,000. The prices of fine yarn and 42-count yarn remained at the original price. Only 32-count double-strand yarn was uniquely expensive by 670,000 because weaving factories were requesting it and Fangjian had not been on sale for several periods. Yesterday, Fangjian continued to sell 17 kinds of wool and serge, 28 kinds of brocade, and 11 kinds of American and Mexican cloth. As usual, yarn will be sold next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Spot Cotton Market Is Slightly Cheerful <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's New York American cotton telegrams were closed due to the holiday, and there was no news. The spot cotton market in this port was stimulated by the soaring US dollar and yarn prices, and the situation was also brought about, but Fangjian Company and private yarn factories were all optimistic and did not make purchases, so there was not much development in transactions. Only there were occasional embellishments, and 6700 bales of Indian NT, Meterlin Brazilian flower Pengjiapo flower were traded, and the price was about 120,000 yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The New Longjing Market Is Stable, Tianjin Gang Has News of Purchasing Scented Tea <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since the third and fourth batches of the new Longjing tea, the supply from Wenhang has remained constant in recent days, but the quality is becoming increasingly old. Therefore, although the price has fallen before, the market atmosphere is particularly stable under the customer's relaxed attitude. As for old goods, buyers are always bearish, and because actual sales are not good, acceptance is still sluggish. However, some sellers are eager to realize cash, and there are many sales at discounted prices, so the situation is still not awakened, and the market is still trending downwards, especially the top Qimen tea in 1934, which has fallen to 160,000 yuan per lot. Compared with February, it is impossible to calculate the distance. As for scented teas such as Zhulan and Jasmine, according to news from Tianjin Gang, there may be a revival in the near future.</p>

<p>The Central Bank issued a notice to all yarn factories and cotton merchants yesterday, asking them to gather detailed reports on the cotton demand of each factory before April 26, for research and discussion, and to use 33 million US dollars of American cotton loans. Those who have not received the notice can ask for it from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank at No. 15 Bund.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Speculation Is Stirring Up Trouble, the US Dollar Rises and Falls Suddenly, Doing 2,430 at the Highest Time, Returning to 2,200 in the Afternoon <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying interest in the US dollar continued to be strong. The exhausted dollar market could not withstand the competition. The silver exchange industry could not comply, and tried to separate the buying and selling price difference as much as possible. The buying price was getting higher and higher, rising from 2,310 yuan to about 2,430 yuan. At this time, the gold market was blocked by the Bank of China, and the hedging was rolled up to 670 yuan per ten taels, which caused some profit-takers to hedge and convert, and the supply of US dollars turned abundant. Various foreign banks also stuffed out a large amount of spot goods. The US dollar, which had been rising for many days, began to fall from the saturation point. Later, the settlement was temporarily stopped. Speculators in the hands of real goods were slightly panicked. Before noon, it fell back to the 2,200 yuan mark. At noon, it spun vertically around 2,250 yuan. In the afternoon, it was again unsustainable and returned to the 2,300 yuan mark. As a result, it closed 100 yuan lower than the previous day. After this temptation, holders of US dollars rushed to convert, and the hedging was finally pulled open to about 710 yuan per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar once saw a high price of 425 yuan after a period of scrambling to buy it, and then returned slightly with the general trend. As a result, both new and old were even. Robbie's Hong Kong electricity still stood at the original price. Although the US exchange rate was level, the designated bank's pair was raised to 2,050 yuan to 2,060 yuan.</p>

<p>Washington, April 19, US News Agency: According to the US Department of Agriculture's estimate this week, the US cotton export can transport 3.25 million bales by the end of July this year. France is currently the country that imports the most US cotton.</p>
<p>The Hangtun (Tunxi) Highway is an important route for the export of Zhengwu green tea and Qimen black tea. It has been washed away by spring rain in many places, and the bridges along the way have been damaged even more severely. It is temporarily difficult to通车. It is also rumored that there are often bandits in relatively remote areas, and it is even more difficult to pass through. Zhengcha only relies on water transportation to Shanghai, which is extremely slow and has a great impact on the tea market.</p>
<p>The contract between the British merchant Dianjun Company in this city will expire on September 10 of the following year.

<p>After a period of silence, government bonds have rekindled their flames, but because the trading venue is full of crises, large households dare not openly and blatantly start activities. The liquidity of the black market is secretly protected, and the situation has become exciting. Tongbing was initially below 5,450 yuan, and at one point approached the 5,600 yuan mark. At noon, it hovered below 5,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of A and B were at 2,550 yuan, Ding at 2,600 yuan, and Wu at 2,900 yuan. A slight shout was heard, and as a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous day. Chinese stocks were slightly maintained by a small amount of silver money in the silver industry after the low. The authorities' investigation and prohibition are still strict, and they have been suspended in the middle.

<p>[Reuter's News Agency, London, 19th] The United Kingdom is still implementing a lead rationing system. The total amount of rations for consumers is still 80% of the consumption at the end of 1945. There are two main reasons for the global lead shortage: (1) Lead is not a major military metal, so wartime production has not been encouraged. The production volume in major lead-producing countries such as Burma, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Germany has decreased or stagnated. In other countries, production has declined greatly due to depletion of reserves or lack of labor. (2) The United States was self-sufficient before the war, but it has now become a major patron of the global lead market. This year's US consumption will exceed one million tons, while US lead mine production is less than 40,000 tons per month. (3) Lead is a major construction material, especially in the construction and electrical industries. The global demand is huge.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Past and Present View of Xuchang Tobacco Leaf The Promotion of British-American Tobacco Company The Process of Wu Tingsheng's Improvement <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Production Area</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Before the war, Chinese merchant cigarette factories used American Buddha and Ni tobacco leaves imported from the Americas, and most of them purchased domestic American tobacco.</p>
<p>The products from Xuchang in Yu province, Fengyang in Wan province, and Qingzhou in Lu province are very famous, especially the quality of Xuchang is the best, and the output is also the largest, so the Xuchang tobacco market is naturally known as China's Buddha and Ni.</p>
<p>Trial Planting</p>
<p>The development of Xuchang tobacco leaves began in the early years of the Republic of China. The British-American Tobacco Company guided farmers to conduct trial planting in the Ying River Basin in Xuchang City West, and the results were very good. Later, the Nanyang Tobacco Company also sent people to distribute tobacco seeds here. Over the years, the number of planters has increased, and tobacco fields have expanded to Xiang, Yu, Jiao, Ye, Fangcheng, Lushan, Changge Linying and other counties. The annual export of tobacco leaves can reach about 300,000 bales or more (each bale weighs 200 kilograms). The two companies have tobacco leaf factories in Xiguan, Xuchang, using four-method machines for roasting and storage, which is quite large in scale. Unfortunately, the British-American tobacco roasting factory was destroyed by military disasters in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, which gave Chinese merchant cigarette factories an opportunity to develop. They freely purchased from the producing areas. As for tobacco farmers, because there were many purchasers, they raised the selling price and increased their income, thereby stimulating production.</p>
<p>Improvement But Farmers</p>
<p>However, the farmers all stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve, and the quality gradually decreases. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Lang Tingsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, once presented a statement to the tax authorities to organize the Xuchang American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, and went to Xuchang to preside over the improvement matters. In addition to purchasing American tobacco seeds from the Americas and distributing them to local farmers for variety exchange, he also researched and cultivated seed selection methods in Guandi, Beiguan, Xuchang. Other aspects, such as fertilization and the improvement of Kangkang rooms, were also actively promoted. It was very dramatic, but unfortunately he was assassinated in the winter of the twenty-third year. In the winter of the following year, American advisor Niu Sen was also shot and killed by bandits, which caused the improvement matters to stagnate. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the quality of tobacco leaves has become increasingly worse. Post-war economic construction and improvement of Xuchang American tobacco leaves is also an important policy for rural revitalization.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Random Talks on Kunqu Opera <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhenzhi</p>
<p>It is very difficult to train a Kun opera flute master. Each play has a suite of tunes, and each tune has a Gongpu with rhyme. Even if two plays have the same Bu Bu Jiao, the amount of words added to the lyrics varies, and the tones, pauses, and endings are not fixed. If it is dull and rigid, and always the same, it will not be art. Therefore, a master must have dozens of opera scripts in his stomach that he can memorize before he can take the stage to play the flute. If he always flips through the score, he will feel inconvenient, and his former rhythm will easily be lost. Since the Anti-Japanese War, flute masters Chen Fengming and Shen Sanming have passed away one after another. Fengming came from a Kun opera troupe and practiced playing the Jing. He was self-admiring. When Han Shichang came south, he discussed the art of opera with him and was extremely sincere. Sanming was from Haining, originally surnamed Mi, and married into the Shen family. He was orphaned and poor in his childhood and was willing to work hard. Shen, the owner of a clothing store in Xiaoshi, saw him and felt pity for him, so he trained him to be a flute master. He was honest, upright, and competitive. During opera rehearsals, he often played twenty or thirty scenes without rest, which eventually damaged his lungs and caused him to cough up blood. He died in poverty. His underage son was helped by Mr. Shen to find a job, which can be said to be very caring. Recently, no one has risen to take his place. Only a few actors from the Xianpu troupe are rushing around teaching music. Because good craftsmen are of little value, the well is deep and the rope is short, it has become an image of dim autumn water facing the setting sun.</p>
<p>The dialogue in the opera, sometimes with poetry, or starting with a seven-character four-line verse, although there is no Gongpu to rely on, must first understand the rhythm, prolong the level tone, raise the rising tone high, lower the departing tone far, and interrupt the entering tone quickly. On the one hand, consider the entire text, integrate and understand it, so that you can convey the emotion in the opera. Since the Easternization of European styles, people from all directions have gathered. Ordinary records have switched to vernacular, and spoken statements use Mandarin. If you use words instead of language, only those who know music will enjoy listening to it, and outsiders will find it tasteless.</p>
<p>Kun actors also value opera ethics. The rank of seats in the troupe is not pursued, and the order of rehearsals is not divided by class. The actors open the stage curtain themselves. Recently, because Shanghai is close to the Beijing style, this custom has changed slightly. However, in ordinary times, opera friends gather to sing, and take turns rehearsing, they must first respectfully and sincerely invite someone to accompany them. After finishing, they bow their hands and thank them, feeling grateful for their presence, which avoids the danger of falling. If a new singer is inserted temporarily, a general old friend retreats to accompany the singing, expressing friendship and camaraderie. This is truly a modest gentleman, with the style of bowing and yielding.</p>
<p>Guan Sheng are divided into large and small. Seeing Niang, Qiao Ku, young and handsome, suave and rich, and Langhui, libraries, are large Guan Sheng. The narration is long, with poems interspersed. Danjue's favorite plays are Jiaqi, Sifan, Youyuan, Jingmeng, Duanqiao, and Shuidou. Mei Lanfang played Youyuan, Zhu Chuanming was the cast. Jingmeng, Jiang Miaoxiang cast, just appropriate, The flute player is called the flute king, just like the recent slang, in the future, the pianist of Mei's troupe can also be called the piano king. However, the king is a feudal saying, which can be compared with Shanghai Tang's great king, and can't help but sigh for Kunqu opera performers.</p>

<p>According to well-informed sources: Recently, several prominent social figures, national entrepreneurs, and progressive individuals in the drama and film industry in Shanghai are pooling capital to establish a film company of considerable scale. The fixed capital is two hundred million yuan, with an additional several tens of millions in working capital. The company's business will include film production and the establishment of cinemas, as well as the manufacturing of film equipment. Once approved and registered by the government, it will be able to commence business.</p>
<p>According to a certain gentleman who recently returned from an inspection of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces: The Northwest is the birthplace of Chinese culture, but today its cultural level is quite low, especially in regards to the scientific film industry, which is even more backward. Movie theaters are not widespread, and the facilities are simple, but business is quite prosperous. Ancient costume domestic films are especially popular with audiences. This shows that people in the Northwest are very interested in movies.</p>
<p>Famous playwright Zhao Dan, in accordance with his agreement with the No. 2 Film Studio of China, has completed the screenplay and scenario for a film titled "Jiangnan Love," working on it late into the night. According to Zhao himself, speaking to a reporter from the drama and film society: "Jiangnan Love" is a tentative title and may be changed to a more appropriate one. It is rumored that the cast has already been internally decided, with Bai Yang, Gu Eryi, and others taking on roles, and that Zhao himself will direct, following Wu Yonggang's "A Home of Loyalty."</p>
<p>The "Nation-Building Drama and Arts Society," under the leadership of Zhang Min, Qu Baiyin, and others in Guangzhou, has now gone to Hong Kong to perform publicly. The first play is Cai Chusheng's "Free Port" (the play is set against the backdrop of Hong Kong before and after its occupation), and it will be performed in both Mandarin and Cantonese by two separate groups, led by Hong Dingfen.</p>
<p>The "Film Experiment Factory," headed by famous director Fei Mu, is working intensely. His new work is tentatively titled "At the Head of the Yangtze River" and has already internally selected Liu Qiong, Wang Renmei, Yan Fei, Sha Sha, and others to star in it, with Fei himself directing.</p>
<p>Character Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e113">Qin Yi <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Qin Yi, this name is still unfamiliar to many in Shanghai, isn't it? When the August 13th Anti-Japanese War broke out, she was still very young and hurriedly followed the theater troupe to the interior. She became a sensation in Chongqing for her performance in the play "Wild Rose," although this play is not her most satisfying work. It seems that she has better acting skills in plays such as "Spring Returns to the Earth" and "The Governor on Tour." She did not get many opportunities in film because of the difficulties with equipment in the rear.</p>
<p>She is a native of Shanghai, born and raised, but speaks fluent Mandarin. She has a very good camera-friendly face and a healthy physique, which is very suitable for acting in films and dramas.</p>
<p>She has a deep understanding of film and a high appreciation for it.</p>
<p>She looks very gentle and speaks like she's writing poetry, but her personality is quite strong.</p>
<p>Recently, she returned to Shanghai from the rear, having endured many hardships traveling by land via Yong'an, to participate in the production of "A Home of Loyalty" directed by Wu Yonggang of the No. 2 Film Studio of China, where she plays a wartime young woman. She is currently working in the studio every day.</p>
<p>She especially likes Greer Garson in "Mrs. Miniver," so we can anticipate that Qin Yi in "A Home of Loyalty" will have amazing artistic achievements.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3 id="e114">Salome <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Salome, originally named Salome Where She Danced, is not based on the famous novel Salome by the aesthetic master Oscar Wilde. This film is just a new gimmick from Hollywood producers after making many Maria Montez Arabian Nights stories. Maria Montez was discovered by Hollywood producers for her beauty and made many colorful, alluring films of Arabian Nights stories. It is evident that Montez and the Arabian Nights stories are coming to an end. Now Yvonne De Carlo, who was advertised as being selected from 20,000 beauties, has been discovered by Hollywood producers, and they are giving her a chance to act in a bizarre story, which is the same as the Arabian Nights films that Maria Montez starred in.</p>
<p>"Salome" is about an Austrian dancer named Salome, who is suspected of leaking military secrets after the end of the American Civil War in 1865 and during the Austro-Prussian War. She is rescued by an American reporter and escapes, falls in love with a brave young bandit, and thus develops a series of romantic events.</p>
<p>There is passion, murder, war, bandits, sword fights, music, love scenes, seductive dancing, a palace, and even an awkwardly inserted old Chinese man, a Chinese boat, Chinese decorations, and Chinese music. Because of these, the usefulness of color films is even more increased.</p>
<p>De Carlo is indeed beautiful, no less than Montez, and her dancing is particularly moving. "Salome" is her first starring film. In the future, the types of films that Dorothy Lamour and Maria Montez can play will be added to by this Yvonne De Carlo.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Shanghai South Fire Brigade Alliance Issues Emergency Notice, Hoping All Citizens Pay Attention <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs: Our association is a citizen organization and has existed for more than forty years. Its expenses are usually voluntarily contributed by local people. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the people's livelihood has declined, and our association's finances have been extremely depleted. However, we have dared not to slacken in our difficult work. This time, the celluloid factory on Luxiangyuan Road was careless and the fire spread quite fiercely. Neighboring merchants and residents witnessed our association's efforts to put out the fire, and we were terrified to receive gifts of wine and banquets! Our association sends out firefighters when there is an alarm. Except for a portion of the employees, most are volunteer members who lead and supervise at the scene. Locals serve the local area, purely with a heart of "as if we ourselves were hungry or drowning." However, recently there have been unscrupulous people who often use the name of the Fire Brigade to swindle and deceive. Fearing that this will confuse the public, we intend to publish a notice in the newspaper. However, our association is short of funds, and we can only earnestly request the assistance of the press. We have long admired your newspaper for having a social service column that serves as a mouthpiece for the citizens. Therefore, we dare to submit the original manuscript for your consideration and ask that you publish it as soon as possible, so that not only will the citizens know about it, but the petty criminals will also hear of it and restrain themselves. We will be extremely grateful. Please forward this to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Shanghai South District Fire Brigade Alliance. April 1, 35th year of the Republic</p>
<p>(Notice) "It has been found that on March 10th of this year, a fire broke out at No. 3 Taiyuan Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, due to the carelessness of the Huang Lulu factory. The fire was extremely fierce. After the firefighters arrived at the scene and bravely put out the fire, it was the inherent duty of our association to serve the local area. However, we have now received letters of thanks from Mr. Xu Ziwen of Yinchang Rice Store and Mr. Wang Changgui, the Jia chief of the 254th household, who were not affected by the fire. They also offered two tables of wine and banquets to reward the firefighters, etc. Our association is a business-run organization, and all expenses are voluntarily contributed by merchants and residents on a monthly basis, for which receipts are given. Even if the donations are not enough, our committee members will find ways to raise funds. All members and staff members will never accept rewards. Therefore, we hereby issue a clear notice that when our association's personnel arrive at the scene of a fire in each district, they will be led by the director and supervised by the discipline inspectors. If there is any extortion or coercion, we hope that citizens will immediately report it on the spot. Our association will rectify discipline and will not condone it. Moreover, recently the municipality has unified the fire departments, and the firefighters from the Fire Department who come to Nanshi to put out fires are also strictly disciplined and do not accept rewards. Please take note. Furthermore, our association has never sold fire extinguishers. If anyone claiming to be a firefighter engages in the improper act of selling fire extinguishers, we hope you will sound the alarm and arrest them, and report to our association's districts for investigation. Do not be fooled into paying. This is extremely important."</p>

<p>Lost Sum of 240,000 Yuan Awaiting Claim</p>
<p>The Yimiao Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department sent a letter stating: It has been reported by Officer Pan Huanzhang of the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station: At 15:07 on April 10th, citizens Ni Kaihua, Liu Ziqing, Wu Yougen, and others reported to the station that while they were walking near the junction of Jiucang Street and Minguo Road, they saw a person running wildly ahead, dropping banknotes on the ground. They called out but received no response. The two of them picked up the money, and at that time Wu Yougen saw them from the side. They brought the money to the station together to testify. After the officer questioned them in detail and found no other circumstances, he counted the banknotes in person. The total amount was 240,000 yuan in legal tender. We hereby enclose the banknotes for your review and approval. In addition to posting a notice for collection, we hereby publish this in the newspaper, requesting the loser to go to the Yimiao Branch as soon as possible to claim it.</p>
