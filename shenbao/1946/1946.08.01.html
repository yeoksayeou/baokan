<h3>大局悶鬱無新發展　馬特使周恩來尙未約晤　司徒大使擬即晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕馬帥今尙未邀晤周恩來，其行範門前亦冷落，共產黨代表團會客室中，佇候消息之訪者羣，充溢悶鬰之空氣，咸以馬帥果無任何使命與意見，何忽忽下山，如有意見，何不約見周恩來，循例馬帥每與政府方面接洽後，必以結果轉致共產黨也。據觀察家稱：今日情形顧有惡化之微兆，局勢之滇變，白非由於馬帥從廬山帶來，反之，則為馬帥赴廬山時所携之共黨意見所引起者。因商談之成就，端視雙方之讓步，而今政府一再讓步，仍不促成政治商談之重開，自有其因素，故若干人士咸推測，中共方面前所提交馬帥轉致府之意見，認為必已超越政府所能容忍讓步之限度，空谷之聲，來非無因。今日並有一種不平凡之事，即馬帥曾於中午邀約在就美籍記者晤談，傳係徵詢彼等對我國時局之意見，然全部秘密，外人絕無法犯獲知，即與會之美籍記者，亦被禁止后發電報或洩露任何意見，故衆認此集會為目前前悶鬰空氣中最堪頑味之節目。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕馬師有日內返盧山說，據某氏稱：馬帥返回可能，因司徒大使離戲日久，館務無人照料，交通又極便利，故特返京一行，其與商談或無關。據某氏推測，事熊或無如此惡化之轉變也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕馬帥返京後，今晨八時國府皮參軍曾往訪，唯未晤及，上午十時美大使館參事柏樂華管理方式訪，詢問司徒大使之病況，迄晚六時一刻，龍院長雲又往該談一小時，據共黨方面稱：周恩來今雖未接獲邀約之電話，然周氏決於一日自動往訪。又聞馬帥此次返京，乃因美國在津陸軍問題。擬在京處理。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺卅一日電〕司徒大使病況業已好轉，今日上午曾進牛肉汁，主席待從醫官與美軍醫官均主大使亟須休息。就滬各報館駐牯配者今日紛至美使館慰問大使病況，司徒大使卅一日下午曾語其秘書　：渠病已愈，渠不能前見他人心錄工作，而自己休息，衷心殊覺耿耿，故渠盼一日能起床謁見主席。渠表示願犧牲一已，為世界人類及中美兩國服。雖醫囑尙需休息三五天，但如可能，決於一日晉見蔣主席，作重來牯嶺首交正式晤談。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺卅一日電〕國府政務局長陳方，今吿記者，酈重否認三人會議將移牯舉行。</p>
<h3>共軍雖發動全面攻勢　政府不放棄和平　彭部長答外記者問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕外記若招待會卅一日上午四時半舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長鍇主持。茲錄彭部長之答語如次：（一）關於軍事形勢：蘇北方面，如臯以北保持接觸，共軍對六合之攻擊，已被擊退，國軍已進天至長盱貽以北，皖北方面共軍，對睢寗西方之攻擊已彼擊退，泗縣五河在國軍手中，山西共軍集中十團兵力進攻大同。（二）關於政治形勢：由於其軍開始全面攻勢，和平商談遂毫無進展，中共於軍事活動之外，繼續各種破壞行動，如戰壞鐵路經濟封鎖等，此種政策誠如美國在華德系各報紙所謂「統治或統亂」，唯政府仍當不放充和平解決之努力。（三）關於顧不使在美國談話：余未見其原文。為能加以評論，唯內戰一名詞，不弊害用於中國之現局。正確言之，即一方為中國共產黨企圖以武力爭取政權，而其武力，卻居劣勢，故採取各種策略，如感衆之宣傳，神經之戰術，以及封鎖經濟對壞交通等，期造成最大之混亂，以增加共產革命之機會，他方面為中國政府正竭力尋求政治解決之途徑，但不能逃避維持國內安全秩序之責任，被攻擊時必須抵禦，例如山東之衝突，即由共童在停戰其內攻佔德州而起，蘇北衝突，由於共軍之攻泰興，每次國軍抵禦共軍之攻擊，則中共必大聲疾呼「內戰」起矣。三日以前有共軍便衣隊三百餘人偸襲京滬鐵路，政府造兵驅散之，吾知中共必載指而責政府曰此「內戰」也。前日共軍在平津公路向車上之美海軍開槍，死傷頗衆，國軍警衛部隊趨至擊之，此將又為「內戰」之一證矣。（四）關於共軍在平津公路上襲擊美海軍人員事，政府已接初步報吿，對於此項暴行，不勝震悼，自當澈底追究處罰此不幸事件，實足指示中共對於民主與保障人權之觀念。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三十一日電〕彭部長學沛定一日晨乘機飛潯轉赴牯嶺。</p>
<h3>主席觀劇</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺三十一日電〕今晚夏聲劇社在夏令營演「木蘭從軍」，蔣主席，贛省主席王陵　，中委羅家倫等均往看劇，演出極為精彩，主席領為嘉許。</p>

<h3>何應欽在美談話　中其不願急於獲和平　襲擊美軍在破壞交通</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廣播：華盛頓訊：保應欽將軍稱，前赴東北視察時，曾發見蘇聯已將飛機廠及汽車廠中之機伴及厘料搬運一空，但渠不願發表蘇方所搬走之數字。共軍於平津間伏擊美陸戰隊事，除在破壞公路交通外，別無其他意義可言，蓋其軍圖破壞公路及鐵路以阻碍中國復興，並令政府因問題重重，窮於應付。何氏並指屁責中共不願急於獲致和平協定，謂渠等不遵守整軍方案，即為明證。中共仍不擬裁減渠等之軍隊至今年一月間協定所規定之最低限度，迄今政府方面所知中共之武器，最取之於國內。當詢及共軍是否確能佔領上海時，渠答稱：「否」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕何應欽將軍本日指斥中共欲造成無不良分子狀態，俾便乘機推翻政府，建立集權政權。渠稱：中共之企圖甚為明顯，即在破壞國家經濟，阻止美國調解中國糾紛，並擬根據所謂無產階極獨裁政權之理論，推翻政府。黨詢及孫總理夫人所謂「中美反動份子刻欲造成美蘇衝突」一節時，渠稱：「孫總理夫人自一九二八年以來，即採取反政府之態度，余信渠之觀察僅為渠之個人意見」。又稱：渠信在日軍未完全解除武裝及遺送完畢前，美軍仍須留華。</p>

<h3>人民自衛訓練完成　濟南防固人心定　惟經濟前途危殆萬分</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南卅一日〕山東局勢因共軍之一再廣泛進攻，促成國軍之堅強自衛，復以黨政軍之密切合作，卒能渡過驚風駭浪之危機，濟南現每晚雖習聞宣示戒嚴之意笛，但人心安靜，已無驚慌之表現，較之前月共軍國攻一夕數驚已判若天壞。全市人民自衛訓練已吿完成，更增強人民能確保地方之信心，而煤礦區之保持燃料問題獲得解決，黑暗已久省會，近日可大放光明。濟南已數日不聞調處消息，第七執行小組刻在靑島，沿膠濟路實地勘察日期尙未確定，濟南外國共軍仍不斷進製，國軍均堅守陣地，未彼侵入，惟濟城彼聞日久，物資來源斷絕，物價飛漲，高於全國，商店工廠均虧累不能支持，經濟上陷於竭澤而漁之狀況，前途危殆萬分。由共軍區逃來之難民，仍有加無已，當已雖竭全力，不能解決救濟問題，難民羣中賣妻豐子自殺等慘劇，時有所聞，彼等皆係家產被收，生活斷絕，中央政府如下迅予拯救，必學出更嚴重之後果。根據雖民談述共軍在共「解放區」之「鬥爭」政策，確已失去人心。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>保護僑胞刻不容緩</h3>
<p>在日本澁谷事件，日警槍殺吾台灣同胞，政府還遲遲沒有提出抗議的時候，印度尼西亞同華僑的關係又趨緊張，棉蘭城發現被肢解及被斬首華僑的屍體，殘酷兇狠，駭人聰聞。同時越北十餘萬華僑，亦個越法衝突，而殃及無辜。越南當局不時搜捕華僑，任意沒收鈔票，並禁化東方匯理銀行鈔票流通，對於華商貨物，又額外設關徵稅，種種壓迫行為，使華僑蒙受莫大的損失。　　抗戰以來，海外僑胞，因為戰爭的影響，傾家游產，流離死亡，成千累萬。方以為抗戰勝利，強權崩潰，中國國際地位提高，可以重新安居樂業，然而暹羅僑胞，立刻就遭受大批屠殺；荷屬東印的血跡未乾，日本澁谷事件又起。七月間菲律賓獨立，我國特使甘乃光赴菲參加慶賀，和約商約未得訂立，菲政府忽頒佈零售商及勞工法令，對華僑生活突施嚴重的打擊。在這些事件接二連三的發生之後，印度尼西亞和越南的殘殺壓迫又在變本加厲的重演了。</p>
<p>海外僑胞對祖國關係的重要，盡人皆知。在過去幫助革命，補償對外損失，捐獻抗戰，不必再說；就是現在，中國入超從一月至五月達到二千億元，國民經濟受着嚴重影響的時候，海外僑胞在百業蕭條之下，艱苦奮鬥，仍然不斷匯款回國，他們對祖國的忠誠，更值得我們的欽佩和感動。然而祖國政府對於他們最低限度的兩個要求，生命的維護，與財產的保障，都沒有切實作到，未免太不負責了！　　假如說中國政府有心不負責，當然決非事實，政府也未嘗不想幫助他們，保護他們。但是政府對於釀成今天僑胞所遇到的悲慘命運，實在害了兩種最大的病根：第一是拖延，第二是軟弱。每當一件慘殺案的發生，政府不能採取積極行動，一切手續，只做官樣文章，先則調查，繼則報告，終則考慮，等到抗議提出之後，屍骨己寒，暴風雨已過，交涉也不過隨便敷衍了事，頂多道一次歉，說一聲「遺憾」，來一次保障不再發生同樣事件的聲明，己算上上，然而同樣事件，不久又必繼績發生。關於壓迫華僑的法令，也是因循萎靡，甚至抗議也懶得提出，以為與其提出而無效，不如不提。這樣拖延的惡習，對內如此，對外亦然。政府年來一切行政效率的低落，就壞在這個「拖」字訣！而我們在海外的僑胞，也就吃了我政府「拖」病的大虧。</p>
<p>軟弱比拖延的病根，貽禍更烈！拖延在某種情勢之下，或許還可以原諒，至於軟弱卻絕對不可饒恕。過去因為國勢積弱，強鄰環伺，還可以說弱國無外交。現在中國雖不能貨眞價實的算強國，到底也是戰勝國家之一，國際間至少名義上是列在五六強國之中了。對戰勝的強國，我們已經不該再存絲毫自卑的心理，對於助紂為虐的暹羅，維琪政府造成惡果的法國，和殖民地的越南政府，全世界人類罪人的日本，甫得獨立的非律濱，蠻橫的印度尼西亞，為什麼也如此的小心翼翼，忍辱含垢，不敢挺起腰骨來說幾句硬話？人有人格，國有國格。中國如果長此下去，我們的國格，將為一般輕骨頭的外交官丟盡了醜</p>
<p>如果說政府鞭長莫及，不能以武力作後盾，所以交涉困難，這又不是事實？當暹羅慘殺華僑的時候，我國在越部隊，儘可陳兵邊境以為後援，然而卻卑躬折節，移樽就教，反而派使去交涉。暹羅政府請其住皇宮，設盛筵，極力敷衍，然而使節甫出宮門，殘殺的惡劇即在街上演出，何以政府仍要忍讓？越南法政府不過佔幾個重要城市，越政府勢力方及全越，何以在越駐軍僅只對法政府交涉，只知與法政府唯唯諾諾的周旋，不與越南政府訂立詳細條約，竟立即迅速撒兵，以致造成今日華僑痛苦的局面？</p>
<p>拖延和軟弱，無疑是今天中國政府最大的病症，也是一切對內對外問題召禍的根源。即如國共問題，勝利以後，政府讓共軍盤踞侵略，大量擴充部隊，荼毒生靈，協商談判，遷延時日，一讓再讓，弄成今天不可收拾的局面，到了還是不能不下決心，解除首都的威脅，然而千萬國民的生命財產已經損失，長陷於水深火熱之中。交通破壞，貨運不行，工商業日趨凋蔽，外貨傾銷，造成經濟行將朋潰的現象，而逞兵好戰之徒，反得掉其如簧之舌，將一切責任諉之於政府。難選這不是拖延和軟弱所造成的嗎？春秋時代，鄭莊公克共叔段，後之論者，還有人要說叔段固有應得之咎，而莊公縱之於先，難逃賢者的責備。故拖延和軟弱決不是正當辦法。</p>
<p>中國有句成語：「仁而不武，無能為也。」今天中國政府的存心實在是太「仁」了，而一切的招侮，卻是不武。「武」，並不一定是用兵，乃是要剛毅果斷，不畏強禦，應做即做，絕不苟且，根絕一切因循萎靡儒弱不振之風。又如懲治貪污，裁制強暴，向戰時利得者徵課，這些關係國計民生的大事，在在應該當機立斷，而目前則政府，都不能表現其武德。中央政府今天受了中華民族四萬萬五千萬人的委託，負了保護一千五百萬海外僑胞生命財產安全的責任，應當奮發有為，一洗從前的弊病。我們希望政府趕快拿出辦法來，安定國內的秩序，保護海外的僑胞。</p>

<h3>澳代表伊瓦特昨在和會　為各小國仗義執言　擬訂和約應以公正為原則　莫洛托夫稱波茨坦宣言必須履行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：和平會議第二次全體大會，今日下午在巴黎舉行，蘇外長莫洛托夫發表演說，凡十五分鐘，要點如次：（一）各國必須維護外長會議之威信，決不能破壞外長會議決案。（二）波茨坦宣言，必須確切履行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎卅一日廣播：澳洲出席歐洲和會代表團長伊瓦特今日發表演說，略謂，五強於獲得勝利之後，不應遺忘其他十六國所獲之共同勝昨，澳洲即屬此十六國中之例。我人在同一代中，有兩次遠涉重洋出征歐陸者，兼為共同之勝利而受到極大犧牲。六年之中，我人對德義日三國同時輾轉作戰於歐洲，遠東，北非，地中海等戰塲，作戰區域遍及全球。伊瓦特並謂：我人亦不應漠視希臘，紐西蘭，非洲及加拿大等國人民之英雄抗戰，勝利乃由全體盟國之努力而得，故在屬於各國之共同和平中，亦應予以同樣活躍之參與權利。渠主張巴黎之和會不宜僅為諮詢性質，應賦各國以眞正與有效之參預，是以草擬和約之事，應屬諸各國，不應僅屬於三四強國。伊氏繼引伸貝爾納斯於一九四三年十月五日所發表之演說，及莫洛托夫在倫敦外長會議時之言論，為各小國國爭。澳代表伊氏繼又析述草擬和約之原則問題謂，列強不得基於復仇精神，將意志強迫他人接受，我人之目標乃「公正」一詞，全球各國男婦老幼均盼獲得一對彼等及其子孫符合公平原則之和平．我人茍以不公允與過份羞辱之重負，加於彼等之身，則有違民主精神，而法西斯又可能捲土重來云云。</p>
<h3>和會表決權問題　規程委會中發生激辯　蘇聯堅持三分二票數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日光播：和會規程委員會本日午前十時繼續開會，對表決權問題，各代表發生激烈爭辯。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：莫洛托夫對於澳代表伊瓦特然指為「播弄表決權之某種詭計」。伊瓦特發言時間甚長，力言和平非歐洲局部問題，而為整個世界問題，並稱，第二次世界大戰不僅對德作戰，同時亦對日作戰，荷繭及澳洲於對日作戰，曾盡極大努力，波茨坦及莫斯科會議公報內並無三分二通過議案之規定。希臘代表與小國代表完全一致，反對三分二辦法。莫洛托夫不加說明，對小國稱，「播弄表決權可能引起會議之僵局。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：莫洛托夫對於小國反對四強控制會議，加以反駁，指摘贊成過半數表決權之國家施用詭計，企圖得技術上之表決權，此舉渠認為足以危害蘇聯集團，而有利盎克羅撒克遜集團。莫氏援引法國社會黨晨報Popular之主張以支持其論據，該報謂，「倘採用過半數表決制，盎克羅撒克遜集團可穏得十二或十三票，而蘇聯則始終被列於少數地位。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：莫洛托夫發言畢，某美國代表起立稱，貝爾納斯將於八月一日提議，對於重大事項之表決，必須有三分二之多數票數。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎卅一日電〕規程委會斯拉夫代表要求准許阿爾巴尼亞為和會第二十二出席國家，其理由謂，阿國為最先遭受義大利侵略之一國，並受議國之蹂躪。荷蘭代表則提議由地主國法國任和會永久主席，勿由四強或五強輪値主席。</p>
<h3>和約未協議條款　將提交大會討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三十日電〕四國外長會議所尙未同意之和約草案各項氛擇條款，業座瘡今夜在此間發表，將即提交廿一國和會加以討論，包括美蘇國所提關於聯合國在義大利財產之權利建議各一項。美國建義大利境內之財產，倘不能歸還聯合國人民所受之損失，應令義大利予以全部賠償。蘇聯則建議義大利因首先脫離軸心國，可令其賠償三分之一，英法對美國建義皆予以保留贊成。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬卅一日電〕此間若干人士主張令巴陀格黑奧元帥，隨同義代表團赴巴黎出度和會，令此一簽訂義停戰協定之人與盟國對質，則盟國當能　及其責任。</p>
<h3>對五國和約</h3>
<p>將僅准九國簽字</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：出度巴黎和會之廿一國中，祇有曾對五戰敗國作戰之九國，將准許其簽字於五國和約，其中一國對於任何國和約均不簽字。該九國即英·澳·紐·印·南非·蘇聯·白俄羅斯·鳥克蘭·及捷克。美國迄未與芬蘭作戰，加拿大從未對保加利亞宣戰，南斯拉夫及希臘僅與接壞之軸心國宣戰，法國。中國及其他五國僅對義國宣戰，　戴迄未與五國中任何一國宣戰。</p>
<h3>美四十八州黑人　包團總統府</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕來自美國四十八州之黑人，今日包團白宮，以示抗議喬治亞州黑人夫婦兩對被白人殺害之事。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯鄭重宣稱　美決不回復孤立　保證尊重各小國意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三十日電〕巴黎和會於今日下午四時開會，首由美國務卿貝爾納斯發言，英相艾總禮，中國外長王世杰（演辭全文見另電）等繼之。明日之會議，當於下午三時舉行，首先發言者當為蘇外長莫洛托夫，莫氏今日未出席。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎卅日專電〕美國務卿貝納斯今日下午在和會中作首次演說稱，凡曾從事戰爭者，必須締造和平，美國將遵守外長會議之協義，但各出度此項和會之各國代表，以三分之二之多數票，提出反建議時，則美國將使大會過該反建議。貝氏提醒聽衆謂，外長會議於起草最後和約時，不僅允予考慮此間所提之各項建議，抑且不武斷担絕任何建議。貝氏繼論美國之孤立政策稱，美國於首次世界大戰後曾不智，決定恢復孤立政策，但目今美國已決定不論國際合作途徑如何困難，決不再採取同樣政策。貝氏此點聲明博得堂聲，並反對長期大量佔領各業被有效解除武裝之國家，蓋此乃保障和平，而非獲得和平之方法也。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎卅日合衆電〕貝爾納斯並宣稱，美國於英國之支持下，保證將充分顧及各小國之竟見，英首相艾德禮亦稱，和會亟欲於此聽取十七小國家之意見。</p>
<h3>和會花絮</h3>
<p>〔漢國新聞社巴黎卅一日電〕盧森堡門口設立酒排間，供給新聞記者啤酒及酒類，生涯鼎盛，一隊隊的記者們踏出會塲，在潤排間中高談暢飲。這種豪飲是否會塲溫度昇高或者是會議乏味，須待歷史家決定了。</p>
<p>多數代表在盧森堡宮花團內漫步，於花園錦族中啜得檳或精緻的鷄尾酒，亦為賞心樂事。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯曾光顧一家平民食堂，而不進入時鬆的餐館，這是他的入胃主義，貝氏對於飲食一這，門檻甚精。</p>
<p>會塲的演說平談無奇，但有一位太太的頭飾卻大出風頭，這位太太帶了黑帽進入會議聽，帽上飾着兩只雪白和平鴿子，大得詫異。</p>
<p>會塲佈置無微不至，盧森保宮屋頂有消防人員六名，日夜看守，以防萬一發生火災。</p>
<p>法國的參戰軍人及傷兵們也軋鬧猛，要求增加恩俸，但截至目前為止，不過將出席會議代表的汽車，阻住了若干時間而已。</p>
<p>首席代表的汽車上，都插白旗，其他代表汽車上則插紅旗，汽車內所坐者是否經人，一望而知。</p>
<h3>英自由黨報傳稱　蘇聯政府改組　莫洛托夫將出任總理</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三十日電〕英國自由黨機關報「星報」頃載稱，蘇駐英大使塞夫有出任外長可以有，這現在巴黎出應和會，消息靈通人士對比甚為注意。按在本年一月間，渠在倫敦代表蘇聯出席聯合國大會，說明及辯護蘇聯所抱見解頗為有力，乃得蘇政府之器重。而蘇政府已有關員敦人逝世，再加以史達林本人身弱多病，內閣改組勢所不免，渠爾，則莫洛托夫外長將為內困總理，所貴外長一　當由蓋塞夫大使繼任。至於外次維幸斯基或將退出外交界，而謂任與復興蘇聯經濟有關之各部主管長官。</p>
<h3>保希邊境　局勢嚴重</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅與卅一日電〕紐約時報記者稱：近數十年來希臘曾三次遭受保加利亞之攻擊，故希人對保威具戒心。保國在此次戰爭中，並無多大損失，近日謠傳保國在希臘邊界一帶，集有重兵，普洛夫狄夫一帶復有遊匪持保國之武器蠢動，故希臘特拉斯省之農民，値茲收穫時期，頗為　惴不安，盛傳英軍一旦撤退，保軍即將進攻希臘。彼等指出保軍對於該處地菜，殊為熟悉，且自保國邊界至海岸，最狹處不過二十哩，故一旦發生戰事，保軍得於頃刻之間，切斷希臘與特拉斯省之聯絡，因此保希邊境局勢，在種種心理不安之狀態下，似頗為嚴重。</p>
<h3>傳美暹羅要求　撤回對越控訴案</h3>
<p>不欲妨碍美法諒解</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕據可靠息：美國務院本日要求　羅向警合國撤回暹越邊界問題之控訴案。要求動機雖未經官方被　，惟華盛頓外交界認為漢國需法國在歐支持其反對蘇要求之立塲，故在現階段之議事中，亟欲避免參加足以影響法諒解之任五爭論。</p>
<h3>蘇檢察官亦主張　德戰犯應全處死</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡三十日電〕國際法處蘇聯倫察官魯屯哥今日當庭主張將德戰犯廿二名概處死刑，謂此種判決將使全人類一致滿意。各犯被技控各罪已充分證明，現應處以極刑，無一　外。</p>
<h3>蘇聯向美國借款　至明年始有成功希望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕蘇聯欲向美國借款，即使僅佔英國借款幾分之一，大約至少亦須待至明年始有成功希望。據交互式蘇聯政府頗有意向美商借十億元，惟美國於數月前通知莫斯科，若蘇聯允於同時討論對巴爾幹各國及蘇聯勢力範團內各區之通商關係，則美國願討論此項借款。此後即寂然無聞，對蘇偕款必須經由進出口銀行，不若英國借款直接由國　支付，該行為一政府機關，其庫存遠在十億元以下。增加進出口銀行基金一節，並朱提出正式請求，國會正在努力結束各案，以備休會，故欲於本年內採取行動，殊覺進遙難期。惟在對英借款論論中，蘇聯頗佔重要地位，擁護此案者謂三十七億五千萬無借款，可使英國成為防禦共產主義蔓延之堅壁云。</p>
<h3>美試放火箭　打破昇高紀錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社辦墨西警州白少三十日電〕陸軍技術人員今日在此半試騐塲試放德國所發明之另1V-2火簡（此已為第九次）浩成一百零四哩新紀鐵，以前紀錄為二十哩半。此一火箭自此間發射放出後，東北面六十九哩處落下，在新墨西哥沙漠中造成一深穴。火箭頭所裝儀盎蕱下時，並無損害，試騐人員當可於此獲得塞上宙綫熱度，及火箭所射到之高空氣壓紀錄。</p>
<h3>英美在幕後支持　西班牙醖釀政變　弗朗哥勢將被迫下台</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕新聞夜報頃載稱，英美兩國得敎廷之默契，擬於本年八·九月問支持西班牙發生政變，該國亞朗達與恩格利亞二將軍，刻在倫敦與華府兩地準備一切，屆時將設立臨時軍政府，預料弗朗哥將不能予以任何抵抗，而將悄然退出政界。臨時軍政府並將舉行公民投票，以決定復辟問題，然後再成立正式政府。新閣員人選已決定三分之二，西班牙共和政府頒袖對於此項計劃，亦表示贊助。</p>
<h3>美國會明休會　三項法案擱置</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國政府所提三項法案，擬增強美國對於世界權力政治控制及扶植美國防務，將因國會之休會而遭延擱，外交當局稱：其中僅有一案，似尙有在國會八月二日休會前通過之些徵機會，其他兩案，已屬無望。以下三棄，均未經參院或衆院通過，即：（一）授權杜魯門總統派遭軍事代表團前往世界任何地點。（二）准許杜魯門總統協助謂練及配備中國軍隊一百萬名，但以馬歇爾特使促成中國團結為僑件。（三）准許杜魯門總統提高整個西半球軍隊與配備之票準，以鞏固防務。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕權威息：英美專家在倫敦討論巴勒斯坦問題後之報吿書，已送呈杜魯門總統，由總統轉交內閣審查。據悉該項報吿除建議巴勒斯坦分治外，並建議由美國撥款三萬萬元，供阿拉伯國家，作為發展經濟之用者，其餘之五千萬元則係專供巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族之用者。</p>
<h3>國際法庭　聽取僞滿問題</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京卅一日電〕遠東國際法庭今日傳前僞滿資政局長笠置良成，巴述僞滿樹立經過。按日軍於樹立僞滿傀儡政權前，先組繼所謂自治指導部，笠置答辯護人大原之質問，力言日軍之組織該指導部，係為維持治安，一似該證人係被吿所延請者。繼由檢察宗官提出有關日本侵略東北之各種文件證據，最後由担任東北問題之檢察官劉愛琳夫人提出日本支配東北之各種證據文件，其中日內閣於一九三四年三月卅一日決定之「日蒲經濟編制方策要綱」，內稱東北之交通，通訊等有關日本國防者。置於日本實權之下，加以適當之統制，氨迅速使之發展。東北之金融亦加以適當之編制，使日「滿」兩國之金融組織得以圓滑。又儘量　送日人移殖東北，以供發展東北產業所需之技術及勞力。</p>

<p>恢復和平之第一個具體步驟，過去數月間全世界人民均期待有一足令渠等對未來局面。不再憂煩之朕兆，然渠等所抱希望，亦曾屢因和會是否可以開會之欵雲而幾度趨於黯淡。今日廿一國代表居然能相聚一堂，商計和平解決辦法。此事本身，已足給予世界以莫大欣慰，而選定巴黎為舉行和會之地點，亦甚令人滿意。巴黎素以愛好正義自由聞於世，當能給予全體出席代表以無限興奮，助我人努力完此重大任務。此次法國政府對各到會代表，竭誠招待，並給予便利，余謹代表中國代表團，表示感倆。中國代表團此次參加和會，抱有熱烈火希望和會成功之心情。中國參加第二次世界大戰時間最長，且係最先武裝抵抗軸心侵略，又為最後結束。武裝抵抗之國家在歐洲戰塲上，中國雖未直接參加軍事行動，但我人在此全球戰爭中，所應盡之責，已全部盡之矣，</p>
<p>中國抗戰</p>
<p>八年，損失數千萬人之生命，此不得謂為渺小犧牲。因鑑於和平亦猶戰爭之不可分割，故中國對聯合國在世界任何部分真實立和平之工作，均不得不關心及之。贏得和平並不較易於範得戰爭，殆無疑義。吾人盡知提出條件而施諸戰敗國為一事，而將此種條件置於條約中，且經長期證明其為可行，而使和平得以持久，則完全另為一事。中國代表團堅決相信，如一切建議衣提案，毋論工礦企業　何國代表團所提出者，均能接納，且按其本質獲得其應得之考慮，則最足欣幸。且在建議討論中，吾人相信當能開誠佈公，而關後對此等討論之公開，將在促進各國　之眞實諒解上甚為有效。關於</p>
<p>和平條件</p>
<p>余目前不欲評述，但甚願特別強調兩點，蓋自吾人觀之，臺北次或以後召開之和會，能獲成功，此兩點必須格外注意。第一，戰勝國心須屬遵彼等在戰爭期間所作之諾言，以及其所揭　之原則。例如言及調解，領土要求之衝突問題，吾人必不可忘記大西洋意章，亦不可限制其實施，第二，戰勝國不應向戰敗國提出致令戰敗國內之反動份子得捲土重來，而使民主力量失去任何新生或鞏固機會之條件。由上所述，余願簡略闡明中國代表團并提交大會考慮之各項和約草案，第一，就</p>
<p>軍事條約</p>
<p>而論，余相信各草案已予各聯合國以適當之安全保障，同時又應使各戰敗國不致認為意於嚴厲。且就義大利而言，其在戰爭未期所作之表現，業已獲得當承認。第二，至於領土政治及經濟條款，余相信各草案應由大會作較為充份之討論，因所涉及之論題，對歐洲未來之安定，大有影響。任何人試閱此等和約草案，均不能否認許多所獲致之協議，威係根據互相之妥協，如吾人能覓獲改進方法，此並非為任何有關方面之狹利益，而實為廣大普遍之利益。若於此等協議，必將且必應獲致。第三，關於義殖民地問題，吾人必須投標認此問題尙未獲解決。中國代表團以為和會必須接受某種</p>
<p>基本原則</p>
<p>以為吾人尋求最後解決之準繩。此原則之一，應為義大利若干殖若干殖民地應立即予以獨立若不能實行，則應於一定期間內，置於聯合國托管制之下，在此期中，應完成其自治與獨立之準備。此種政策之影響所及百僅限於直接有關之領土之人民，並將使其他各處正待早日及完全實現其正當願望之百萬人民之獲得若干希望與信心。參與此會之吾人意見，可能分歧，但吾人所代表之一切國家之普通人民有一致之願望，即此會議在謀得眞正而持久之和平。彼等似有一普遍之顧慮，即參加此會之各政府，在此具有歷史史性之事業中尙未克合作針間。最後予表示希望和會之工作，終能足普通人民之普遍願望，而能消除其欵慮，俄使吾人所締造之和平，乃為普通人民之和平，而不僅政府代表之和平，一如以往之若干和平處置。</p>

<h3>被檢舉之何德奎　僕僕京滬·照常辦公　程監察使發表談話　認為影響政風　昨會往市府詢問達半小時　監院決繼續調查依法辦理</h3>
<p>上海市政府秘書長何德奎，被檢舉案，據昨日各報登載吳市長對記者談話，渠當靜候行政院命令云云。茲悉江蘇區監察使程中行·監察委員范爭波·張慶楨三氏，昨晨十一時會同前往市府，向吳市長詢問本案辦理情形，並調閱有關案卷，程范張三氏在市長辦公室對何德奎詢問達半小時，三氏在下午一時方離開市府。記者在市府門前叩詢三氏調查本案情形，據答，案情甚爲簡單，本案性質，一方面爲法律問題，另一方面爲政治風紀問題。法律方面，自應由法院依法決定，至政治風紀方面，則根擄羅參政員所提證據，何德奎在工部局所簽暑公文之時間，已爲卅一年六月，其時中國與日本全面抗戰已及五年，工部局董事會崋董均已撤退，而當時之總董早易日人，何德奎係中華民國人民，應自知本國對外交戰時公民之大義與責任。此次檢舉案發生，何旣僕僕京滬，又照常辦公，日前談話，實於政風官方影響甚大。本案在監察院方面，自當繼續調查，依法辦理云。</p>
<h3>張知本談　清查接收　根據證判別好壞是非　表示決認真的做</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在今日上海最受人注意的人物是張知本，他是接收工作淸査團團長，他的工作對象，專門針對着勝利以來辦理接收工作的大員和大員們所代表着的各種機關，他要淸査天文數字的敵僞產業是怎樣被接收的，是怎樣處置的，他要接受全上海市民任何人的申訴，和代他們伸雪，就這幾點，你就知道他的任務是怎樣的艱鉅了。</p>
<p>昨天下午五點鐘，在復興中路辣斐坊十七號，記者會見了這位六十六高齡的長者，銀絲般的頭髮，和滿臉的縐紋，正說明了他老人家數十年來的工作是如何困難，是如何難於處理。他早就認淸這個新的工作是比行政法院要更進一層的任勞任怨，他勇敢的對記者說：「旣然担當了，要認眞的做。」同時他又說明：「現在的監察制度與從前的御史制度完全不同，我們要根據確實的證據，判別「好」和「壞」，「是」與「非」，在未明瞭眞相前，絕不能作籠統的批評，我們辦事一切要合於「法」。「法」好像與他是一個不能分離的名詞。張團長是司法界的老前輩，民國初年曾任司法部長，民國十六年曾一度出任湖北省主席，政府一直倚重他，抗戰期間做了八年的司法院秘書長，和行政法院的院長，行政法院並非普通法院，他是專門接受老百姓對官署處置不服的控訢，張老先生也就幹了數十年的監察工作，一般市民也許對他還生疏，但中華民國的官吏却很少不知道他的。這次接收工作最錯綜複雜的上海，由他來領導淸査，我們認爲最合理想的。</p>

<p>華股混亂已極，大戶之實力份子，頗多空美亞多永紗之活動，兩者遂背道而馳，三小股為狀平穏，不若兩大熱之極盡變幻，永紗先見低價六五五元，後又市至七一〇元，最後在七〇〇元關邊徘徊，美亞則先郵高價四二〇〇元後，步跌至三七〇〇元以下，臨收復盤上至四〇〇〇元外，景福由低價二四〇元，盤高至二六五元，新光自二三五元升至二五五元，勤興自一七八元升至一九八元，午刻都呈盤旋，冷門各股尙形平穏，結果與前收橡皮圈我計永紗升起半成，美亞則徵降不多，三小熱日趨漲高半成光景，較冷各中小型平穏微升，世界書以求供飄忽，昨突回小不少，元老股平殂無變動。</p>
<p>外股仍難進展，各股求供不一，升降均微，怡紗自八九〇〇元開後，微降至八六〇〇元，餘者出入均微，盤施而已，結果與前收相較，計英聯業廣平平，怡紗怡啤會德應亞洲鋼業則均微挫，紙業微外，市態並無特殊變化。</p>
<h3>外商銀行尙須請示　銀錢凖備會未成立　參加者已達一百六十餘家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀錢業聯合準備會前傳有於今日正式成立之訊。茲記者走訪該會籌備處，據悉：籌備處曾根據上海票據交換所行莊名錄所列之一百七十五家交換行莊及信託公司等，分發通函，邀請加入。昨為截止之期，此中除少慰外商銀行，因尙須請示其本國總行之意見，尙未參加外，已參加者共達一百六十餘家。大致日內即將召開成立大會，以便決定該會今後業務之開展，故今日成立之訊之不確。</p>

<h3>油價回平　油廠照常供應　配價仍照前盤</h3>
<p>本市食油市價最近日見市漲，經市政當設法平抑，昨恢復交易，中國植物油料廠，自本月二十四日起，按日配售兩百桶，現仍繼主動軸配售，據悉，食油銷費量，每日約一千五百担左右，中國植物　料廠配售之二百桶，約為七百担，已佔半懸，目前雖以蘇北，靑島等處食汕來源稀少，但存底甚為充沛，故並不十分缺乏，日前市價高漲實係有人操統，旣放後取消，反在市上收進，以致供求失調，市價因之抬高，經社會局寬員嚴密調查後，商請中國植物油料廠盡力維持，照常供應，其每日配售之二百桶，仍照上禮拜五（二十六日）之價格，每担為六萬八千元。</p>
<h3>紗花布仍無起色</h3>

<h3>食米來源絡繹不裝飾　糧審會再減低議價　麵粉雜糧大致疲弱</h3>
<p>社會局糧食審議會昨日開第十二次平價審議會。出席社會局糧食課長吉朝齋，及印福祥蔡聲明張錫湖瞿振華楊久慈市商會錢興中等，因米糧來源滔滔不絕。故審義價目決定為白粳六萬二千元，較前小二千，門售六萬七千五百元，羊秈六萬，小三千，門售六萬五千五百元，埠秈五萬三千元，小三千，門售五萬八千元，屈秈四萬八千元，小三千元，門售五萬二千五百元，白秈四萬三千元。小三千元，門售四萬七千元，均較前跌落，轉瞬秋節將屆，殊有再跌之可能，越米七萬包，（每一百包合一百五十石）今日可抵滬，出售配給米號，現調查有資格者，昨已增加二百家。合計為一千一百家，前所配給之糙米數量為一萬五千餘有，截至日為止，僅由各米吾民售出約三分之一。社會局為謀公司工廠之同人福利計，每一公司工廠可以人數多　為標準，備函向社會局糧食課申請配給，昨南北來市塲共到八千餘石，市銷仍呆，白粳續小一二千元，秈米步跌一二千元，白元依然少神，亦回千元左右，浦東新粳續見二三十石。米品尙是早色，亦回千餘元，麵粉無全家人兵船粉來貨驟增，頓形軟化，止漲轉跌，下降四五百元，小麥客帮甬閩兩帮進胃不暢，市勢平平，中次反見疲軟，略呈修削，　皮亦挫一二百元，黃豆到源淡泊，去化動而旺，適成兩敵。外埠消化極微，油廠納胃不貪，本街零化略取，開仍站局，蠶豆業貨略少，中下等狂跌之後，已有問津，疲而轉挺，高貨仍趨平淡之格。</p>

<h3>廬山云霧間</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺航訊　特派記者謝寶珠</p>
<p>主席喜歡廬山，有一個原因是因爲　山有水，聽說他會說：一　眉之不及　山美監，乏人避暑，九因爲峨嵋少水。」主席愛水，尤　靜　　流水聲’以助思潮。</p>
<p>主席夫婦的轎子，與衆略有不同，轎頂爲黑漆布，兩旁爲藍布，轎樌比普通的長三分之一，漆或黑色·其木堅細牢固，產自浙江溪口一帶，每樹僅能做樌一根，聽說坐在上面，平穩如汽車，連轎夫換肩都不易覺得。這大多是因爲轎夫技術高明，抬主席轎已有十幾年經騐，由廬山到重慶，再由重慶來廬山。轎夫經常的共有十二人。每項六人，均身穿藍布短衫袴，戴白草　。</p>
<p>特地爲馬帥夫婦定製的兩轎，現正在九江辦理，不日即可完工備用。聽說每轎代價四十七萬元，做得還不是頂好。</p>
<p>牯嶺咖啡空有三間：「卡爾登」「圓明園」和「綠質」。第一家的咖啡好像「炒焦米開水」，第二家的是「紅糖水」，第三家的好比「鍋巴湯」，但每杯價錢僅四百元，不可苛責。</p>
<p>水菓旣貴又缺，冒充「生開士」每只九百元，小靑蘋菓每斤二千四百元，西瓜較多價較廉，但大而不甜，過時枇杷無人渦問，老關大縐眉頭。</p>
<p>正為商店。有一家裝有無綫電，三家備留聲綫，唱片幾全部京戲。最「新」之歌曲爲「芝蘭姑娘」</p>
<p>口香糖有三處出售，但乏人過問，故價錢「挺」不起來“（liiclets）”每盒（二粒裝）三百元。</p>
<p>香烟中以「菲立浦　律斯」晨風行　亦較午如初夏晚如初秋。</p>
<p>來自各地記者不下二十人，給廬山添上不少生氣，但忙煞了電訊局，夜報上午打電話，日報晚上打電話，直到深夜一二時方稍覺　　，此外各機關來往電話也應接不暇。</p>
<p>山上外人不過四十八，「闊氣」與往年相比已不可同日而語。有一洋人買五磅裝「金門」奶粉，索價二萬六，澴價二萬，交易不成。</p>
<p>便宜，每條九千五百元。</p>
<p>照相館像樣的有三家，「揚子」「宏化」「廬眞」，生意並不興隆，僅出賣存貨風景片，但代客冲晒頗忙，都是新開記者「神經戰」後成績表現，價錢雖辣，冲一冲一千元，四寸印一張四百元，但非洗不可。</p>
<p>山中天氣晴時一日如三季：晨如初春，中五分鐘再同成交·因爲他走　街上，二萬六是低最價錢。</p>
<p>街燈如燐火，若干處為黑暗世界，行人夜出，必携手杖及電筒。</p>
<p>山上居民有這風，舉止遲緩，動作　散，每遇請解答問題，輒大兜圈子，半日不得解決，不知是否受了雲霧影響。</p>
<p>日來招待記者之風漸與，第一次爲管理局招待，在七月廿一日下午，有茶點　客，賓主俱歡。</p>
<p>大多數記者均住胡金芳旅社，特自設俱樂部一間，情因各人終日緊張過度，公忙多於娛樂。</p>
<p>夏聲劇團，應夏令營口電　，團員七十餘人。廿六日由漢口來廬，每童腰　救濟總　奶粉一聽，步行上山。此來需費共一千萬元，聞江西省主席王陵基負担五百萬，夏令營拿出五百萬，但招待團員殊欠週到，孩童席地而睡，飯菜僅一隻。</p>
<p>勵志社在此間接收房子三十二幢，故所有舉人外賓上山，都由該社一手包辦招待。</p>
<p>勵志社備有電影供一部分人參觀，夏令營每適兩次，馬帥行館每適二三次，禮拜堂也有二次一週，是山上唯一的電影娛樂，惜機件不太高明，電力又不足，看一個鐘點要等一個鐘點，很感吃力。</p>
<p>最後消息：馬帥夫人對中式康袍頗爲欣賞，很想做幾件穿穿，故蔣夫人特飭自己的栽縫前去爲馬帥夫人裁製。</p>
<h3>廬山主席官邸</h3>
<p>— 本報牯嶺航訉　特派記者謝寶珠</p>
<p>走完牯嶺街沒多遠，你就能看見前面綠蔭叢前豎立着一座一丈多高八尺多闊五彩油畫主席的像，像前的水銀燈因爲位置不合適，已經由斜放，直放而第三次改裝在對面的電桿上了，可惜魔山電力不足，那四隻燈泡發出的光依舊帶有黃光。主席畫像的左邊就是官邸所在的河東路，再走前快到十二號行館時，你又可發現一張蔣夫人的油畫像，面積比主席那張要小一些，官邸前面有綠欄干藍橋面的小橋一座通到對面河西路，就是馬歇爾行館，同樣的在河西路上，也架了一座馬帥的畫像，都是得畫精神弈弈，令人肅然起敬。東西兩路中間隔一淸溪，潺潺流水，在靜寂中帶來了不斷的音調節拍。</p>
<p>主席官邸的　　設計非常特別。是像浪式的一排矮石橋。但因為太低的緣故，現在準備圍種柏樹。進門右邊就是花園。抗戰以前，夫人來廬消夏時，常在這園內打考爾夫球，由端納先生陪她一起玩，道花園在淪陷期間被日人破壞殆盡，非但一花無存，連草皮都被刮光了，夫人愛好花木，所以這次來山上後特地天天親自監督園丁重新佈置，而且還和馬歇爾天人倆研究佈植花草的　　。大門左手，穿過一個攀　架走上石級就可通到住宅一樓的涼台，正鬥是對着花園的。涼台上放着魚白色的　椅，藤桌，週園半圓形有盆花點綴。有時天晴略熱，主席夫婦就在凉台上宴客。</p>
<p>樓下有大客廳、餐廳，休息室，辦公室各一，室內佈置部極簡單整潔，魚白色的傢具，朱紅色的窗架裝上紗窗，窗簾是淡黃色布料製成的。沙發套都是橫條淡綠和魚白相間的顏色上放繡花靠熱。客廳壁燼架上放着的福祿壽三星，倒有一段小故事可講，當日人强佔廬山的時候，就把官邸內的三星搬走，因爲那時在美駐天津總領事史邁斯家有一個日軍官住着，所以就把那三星喬遷到那邊，這次夫人來應發覺三星不見，非常懊喪，但也無可奈何。不知無巧不成事，有一次史邁斯夫人請蔣夫人到他家去玩，夫人一進客廳就發現那三星是他的公館裏的古物，史夫人也到這時方才知道，於是馬上交給侍從人員送回主席公館去，</p>
<p>二樓上也有和樓下相同的一個凉台，佈置也差不多，但多了個睡椅，主席夫婦早晨禱告，主席體操，讀書都是在這個地方的。大客廳的上面就是臥室，後面是主席的書房，再隔壁是夫人的書房，還有小客廳，客廳，浴室等數間。樓上的會客廳多數是給夫人見女客時用的。傢具，窗簾·都和樓下色彩相同，夫人不愛墻壁傢具漆着刺激的顏色，她喜歡淡黃色和魚白色的粉刷。除了大凉台外，樓上還有一個小涼台，在小客廳的後面，但兩個涼臺路不通行。</p>
<p>主席官邸內從前有一架自備發電機，後來給敵人搬走！現在用的電就是公共電廠發的，到午夜十二時就熄了。</p>
<p>這座行館的建築實在可說已經很舊了。可是主席和夫人都喜歡主在原來的老家裏，雖然破舊一些，但它帶給他們親切之感旦萬分深厚的。</p>
<p>水閘鳥瞰圖</p>
<p>水閘位於加州西北小　納西河上，爲世界第四大閘，高四百八十呎，儲水量，一，一〇〇〇〇〇畝呎以上，此二十九哩之長湖爲遊息之中心，有旅　等設備，該閘於三年中加緊造成，其第一座發電廠於一九四五年一月開始發電，芳答那水閘爲TVA計劃中防止洪水，灌漑及發電　做中之一重要部分。（特派員毛樹淸寄）</p>
<h3>田納西叢山谷間　世外桃源TVA</h3>
<p>— 本報十六日航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>田納西州是一個東西狹長的平行四邊形，整個田納西，包圍在四週山色中，我對於田納西的影象，覺得像中國的四川，有些地方很像貴州和雲南，美國的東南角是一個農業的山國，有如中國的西南山地仍然富於農作一樣。美國人給田納西人的外號有兩個，一個呌做「志願兵」，據說是南北戰爭時代的掌故，林肯總統招募南方的勇士，志願入伍，田納西人出身山地，勇敢是他們的特長，因此紛紛以「志願兵」自任，這雖是一個外號，但也是事實。現在美國正在全國各地，徵求志願軍入伍，田納西靑年，奮勇投軍的很多。</p>
<p>田納西縱橫</p>
<p>另一個田納西人的外號，呌做（Hill　Billy）意思即是「鄉下化」，上海話呌做「鄉曲」，田納西多山，很多居住在叢山間的田納西人，他們自耕自食，與外界很少接觸，因之，一且到紐約，或芝加哥，看見處處新奇，難免張皇失措，這當然爲描寫一部份人面而言，事實上，田納西這一類的人也很多，田納西大學的留學生張仁家兄告訴我：有許多住在深山叢谷中的田納西人，和世界差不多隔絕了好幾十年，他們看見美國的最新的物質文明，也許比我們看了更驚奇。</p>
<p>譬如說：紐約和芝加哥一帶的人，對於玩照相，似乎是司空見慣的事，現在田納西的農村中，仍然認爲是一件「大事」，贊田納西的農家孩子照相，他有時會高興得跳起來，有時候會鄭而重之的回家換了衣服再來，田納西的鄉間，男女社交等等都很保守，他們彬彬有禮，充份的保有英國移民過來的「紳士」傳統。</p>
<p>道些不同的習性，山地生長是一個大原因，TVA沒有來到田納西以前，田納西是美國四十八州之中，十分貧瘠的省份。西南的新墨西哥，阿利桑那幾州，雖然儘是沙漠，但他們很早已經有了水利的灌漑。田納西的土壤是紅土，也有許多燬川黔一帶的光禿禿的石山，每年夏初雨季一到，東部山地的「山洪」，像狼奔虎嘯一樣，急流冲下來，田納西的多少田地，廬舍，牲畜，乃至於一座一座的整個市集，都在大水中淹沒，洪流從田納西河流入渥亥渥河口，再匯入密西西比河，流到大西洋。水退了，田納西的士地回復到乾旱，這樣·一來一去之閒，田納西的農作是：「十年倒有九年荒」，田納西的誠樸農民，他們終年過著愁雲慘淡的日子。</p>
<p>偉大的建設</p>
<p>但是，一件偉大的建設，改變了他們的整個世界，這就是TVA，我不能不歌誦TVA的偉大，特別在一個從殘破了的中國農間來的人看來。當我參觀了水閘工程回到諾城的時候，新聞部的朋友蕭弗爾間我看後的感想，我告訴他：「我不是電力專家，也不是農業專家；因此我不懂內邊的許多按術上的問題。但是我看懂了一點，那就是中國需要它」！</p>
<p>千頭萬我不知這應該從那裏說起。好吧！讓我先介紹一個田納西的農民塞密脫。</p>
<p>我到田納西的第五天，才會見塞密脫，那一天，和比利時最高法院的柏希法官，參觀「福特勞敦」水閘，因爲我們要求了解田納西的農業，所以管理局特地派了一位農學專家白蘭克先生陪同我們從水閘回來，我們在附近田間兜圈子，最後找到了塞密脫之家。</p>
<p>塞密脫祖孫三代，居住在一個田莊，他父親老塞密脫，年逾七十，講話已經口齒含糊，他的子女，都在　齡，還不能帮助畊作，因之，一家的生產的責任，都在他一個人身上，他一個人耕田一百英畝，（相當於中國六百畝）有時候，微微感覺人力週轉不過來，但是，他有機器，所以收割和栽種，都不成什么問題。他帶領我們看他的山坡山麓的田地，有膏梁，有烟草，有小麥，也有蕃茄和大豆。他說：九年以前，這兒都是無法耕種的荒地，洪水一到，什麼都冲洗完了。但是，自從TVA的水閘建築了以後，他有了不化錢的「肥田粉」TVA贈送的），他有了每年好幾季的收穫。上個月，他收割了四英畝的小麥，共得了一百零四英斛。</p>
<p>一百英畝的田地，每年他祗須納給政府四十二元的田賦，他養有二十九頭牛，有時候，也利用獸力帮助耕種，那是因爲他祗有兩架機器的緣故，他說，他還缺乏收割膏梁的機器，因此，人力非常浪費。田納西大學農學院的師生，每季都有人來，帮助他改良種子，及除去農作物上的「病蟲害」，而且指導他同一土地之內，菸草，膏梁等等，如何輪流種植。</p>
<p>整個TVA,沒有特殊的灌溉工程，我問他：如果天久不下雨，如何導引水源上山坡來。他抓抓頭，不能置答，他說：不會的，天一定會下雨的！他還說：只要沒有了洪水，這兒一定是豐年，這一步工作，TVA業已替他們做了。</p>
<p>塞密脫是一個三十五歲的中年農夫，泥腿上套一雙破皮鞋，臉上臂上，都長滿着毛，皮膚被太陽晒得紅中發紫，講話有三分憨直可愛，他是一個典型的田納西「鄉老」。</p>
<p>歷史的故事</p>
<p>TVA爲什麼能博得農民的擁護？這裏，不能不從一點歷史的故事講起：</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰期間，德國的潛水艇，一度到達了智利（南美州）海外，美國政府震動了，才對國防工業，作速度的推進，但是，推進的結果，感覺到動力不够，有人知道田納西水力，可以用來發電，以增加動力，乃建議威爾遜總統，建造水閘，永閘沒弄成，大戰結束了，這件案子遂中度擱置。到一九三三年，羅斯福總統執政，因爲參議員瑙雷斯先生的建議，重建田納西水利工程，這就誕生了所謂TVA。</p>
<p>TVA的全名是田納西河谷管</p>
<p>理局，是一個直隸於總統的國營企業機關。（這幾點我都將另文介紹）於一九三三年成立，當時的任務有三件，是國會正式通過，交付給管理局的：第一，防止田納西河谷的洪水泛濫。第二，疏通田納西河的水道航運。第三，利用水力發電增加工業動力。</p>
<p>這三大任務的基本工作，便是建築水閘，沒有水閘，旣不能防水患，又不能通航運，更不能有動力，因之，一般人腦筋中的TVA，以爲便是二十六個水閘而巳，其實，TVA的業務範圍，遠不至此。</p>
<p>田納西河迂迥橫貫過整個田納西州，從東部山岳地帶，流向密西西比河，東部高，西部低，因之，在沒有水閘以前，都是急流淺灘，像四川宜賓以上的金沙江一樣。TVA的水閘工程，分佈在田納西河的上下游交流及支流上，上游有很多水閘，伸入到北加羅里那州及喬治亞洲，最高最大的一座水閘：「方答那」在北加羅里那州境內，水閘高四百八十英尺，和兩岸的山峯相並。田納西河的上游，就這樣流繞在業山絕谷之中。</p>
<p>瑙雷斯水閘</p>
<p>此爲TVA工程中之首先完成者，其發電量達一〇〇，〇〇〇基羅瓦特，该閘儲水量在二，二五〇，〇〇〇畝呎以上，其中五〇〇，〇〇〇畝呎以上之水最係有十四呎高之閘門所節制，圖示水量正由閘內放出。（特派員手　清寄）</p>
<p>方答那水閘</p>
<p>我參觀方答那水閘那天，一位年靑職員茅列斯，陪我前法，從諾克斯微爾城出發，要走兩個鐘頭的山路，汽車走出諾城小盆地，便攢入山岳叢中，公路盡是羊腸小道，倚山臨谷，三步一灣，五步一曲，很像重慶到沅陵的公路，茅列斯將它比爲「滇緬路」，開車時提心吊阻，深怕轉　角上，和來車互幢。靠近方答那水閘附近，盡是陡峭的山嶺，方答那水閘與山峯齊築，遠還可以望見水門汀洋灰的大建築。</p>
<p>方答那水閘的建築是七千三百萬美元，佔水閘工程用費的第二位，第一位是肯塔基水閘，用費一萬萬一千五百萬元，方答那水閘是二十六座水閘中最高的一座，閘前和間後的水位，相隔四百多英尺。水閘全由鋼骨水泥築城，閘上可通行汽率，水量從閘的中間流入發電廠，轉動馬達的輪軸，然後再流出閘外，這樣，方答那水閘所能產生的電力是二十萬二千五百瓦千。方答那附近有處地名叫做「橡樹坡」，便是戰時有名的原炸彈製造廠，原子彈的造成，需要大量的電力，TVA便担當了供給電力的責任。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>父親節推行委會請　本報獨家代收助學金</h3>
<p>捐款人姓名在申新兩報公佈以昭大信</p>
<p>父親節推行委員會昨爲託收助學金捐款，致函</p>

<h3>汽水　夏令最理想的飮料</h3>
<p>— 興海</p>
<p>雖然有人認爲冷飲是一種奢侈品。但是照大體的說起來，這亦可算是一種生理上自然的需要。夏季的天氣，總是非常的熱，通常在華氏一百度左右。所以唯有用出汗的方法，來散發我們體內過剩的熱量，這樣才能保持一定的體溫。天氣愈熱，汗出得愈多，口亦覺得愈喝。這是很明白的指示，體內需要添加一點水份了。</p>
<p>汽水和冰淇淋，是二種主要的食品：其實冰淇淋稱之爲飲料，是很勉强的。冰洪淋可算是一種風味優美的食品適宜於夏天，亦適宜於冬天。解喝的功効，眞是微乎其微。冰淇淋中水份極少，而且太甜太膩，有時甚至愈吃愈乾。</p>
<p>祗有汽水才是夏令理想的飲料。</p>
<p>汽水中糖的含量很少，其濃度差不多和體內血液的滲透壓力相當。可以補充體內散發的水份。汽水中的二氧化炭氣，更有帮助消化，提神消暑的功効。</p>
<p>汽水能適應大衆的需要，上自達官顯宦，下至販夫走卒。所以近年來汽水工業極爲發達。除了有相當歷史的汽水廠像正廣和，屈臣氏，勝利，天華，中央，中華，益利等。今年另外又開設了許多小型的汽水廠，以彌補求渦於供的現象。不過有些小型汽水廠，設備方面，不免因陋就簡。這有關大衆的健康，要請衛生當局加以相當的注意。</p>
<h3>暑中野餐</h3>
<p>— 佚子</p>
<p>廬山是中國的名山之一，距離九江西南約有二三公里，蟠踞在長江與鄱陽湖之間。牯嶺是廬山羣峯中的一嶺，附近一帶地方最熱的時候不過七十五六度，所以實在是優良的避暑地。十四日蔣主席夫婦先後乘機飛赴九江轉往廬山，馬歇爾夫人第二天也接着去了，本月十八日，馬歇爾特使也陪了新任的美國駐華大使司徒雷登坐着專機到廬山看蔣主席，並且呈遞國書。</p>
<p>面向廣寬幽靜的鄱陽湖，在廬山的一個山峯上。距離牯嶺十里的地方，不知什麼人爲道個勝地錫以佳名，稱之爲「含鄱口」。因爲他的氣勢好像要把整個的鄱陽湖吞了下去。蔣主席夫婦，馬歇爾特使夫婦，昨天下午六時到八時，在含鄱口上舉行自他們相識以來的第一次野餐中，爲廬山創造了最美麗的鏡頭。主席穿着平常的軍服，夫人則穿着遊山的西裝。馬帥在南京很少穿便服，而進牯嶺以後，差不多已經與軍裝絕了緣。當然，昨天在含鄱口上也是以翩翩的敏捷風度出現。馬夫人的天藍色西裝，至少有好幾套。因爲在記者的記憶中，他的衣服的形式與顏色，老是不變樣的，</p>
<p>四頂轎子，有兩頂是主席行館裏的，另外兩頂就是中國旅行社的普通轎。馬夫人蔣夫人坐了前兩頂，比較舒服的走在前面，馬帥和蔣主席坐了後兩頂，走在後面。半路遇着記者們，蔣夫人自然地愉快地問：「你們這些孩子怎麼會知道的？」「三天前就知道了。」「啊，眞是順風耳！」</p>
<p>蔣主席亦含笑向記者們說：「你們來玩了？」這種說話，雖然很間單，但是自南京來，尤是在重慶有過記者生活經騐的，感覺到一種鼓勵。本來主席的宵旰勤勞，日理萬機，與記者們見面的一機會實在太少，所以大家都相信勝利後，與元首的接觸一定可以較多，因此，像美國總統的白宮記者招待會，也是在被期待着。</p>
<p>山上的新鮮空氣，使記者們體曾到中國的「白宮記者招待會一已不是理想，而在不久就會到來的事實。昨天在含鄱口上，主席見我們，隨拍照，就和靄地問道：「你們是新聞記者？」「是的：」剛說出，主席就點頭說：「好。」</p>
<p>另外，主席在談話問，輕飄流露了一個洋文字，「我們在什麼地方匹克匿克？」對於記者當然感到一個珍惜。「野餐」的進行，我們不及一睹，夏令營的記者招待會，使我們走上歸途。</p>
<h3>漫談扇子</h3>
<p>— 雲孫</p>
<p>夏天，當你感到大氣炎熱的時候，你會本能的拿起一柄扇子來驅除你周圍悶熱的空氣，享受片時的淸凉，這是扇子惟一的功用。</p>
<p>但，扇子，牠會隨着牠們的主人而改變牠們的作用，同時也可由牠們的身上看出牠們主人的身份。</p>
<p>勞苦的農夫，背後的褲帶上插着一柄破舊的芭蕉扇，在汗流浹背的時候，用牠來搧乾身上的臭汗，陽光猛烈時用牠做一做臨時的草帽，擋一擋猛烈的太陽；晚間納凉時，牠又發揮牠另一特長，牠變爲趕除蚊蟲的惟一工具，使牠的主人着實享受到一番辛福。讚譽牠一聲能者多勞。</p>
<p>風流的戲子，在舞台上不分寒暑始終搖擺着一柄漂亮的大紙扇，開閉自如，現在他的功用，則是他主人惟一的裝飾品。</p>
<p>賦閒的紳士們，橫躺在睡椅上斯文地搖着淸風徐來的紙扇，享受着淸風徐來的淸福，一種幽閒的情景，全由道柄扇子上表現出來。</p>
<p>安樂的公子哥兒，有意無意地微搖着精巧的檀木扇，盡情地享受着陣陣地榷香。或欣賞名人親筆的晝面，更足表現其「農夫心中如湯煮，公子王孫把扇搖」的王孫公子身份。</p>
<p>摩登的小姐們，她們感到在外出時搖揮着扇子有些土氣，將曾有礙她們的摩登化裝，故絕少用扇，但，有時她們的皮包內却藏着一柄極其小巧玲瓏精繳美觀的彩扇，洒上大量法國夜來香，當她和你談天時，她會有意無意地將牠展開而一種濃厚的芬芳香氣立刻衝鼻而來，使你頓感昏昏欲睡心旌不定一如入了新式的迷魂陣，深深使你覺得她是一位華貴的摩登小姐，縱使你在其他塲所看到這柄扇子，也不難推想牠的主人是怎樣的人。</p>
<p>學校裏的學生用着各色不同的扇子，在課堂裏男生用作傳話·吃花生米·看小說的屏風，女生用作照鏡子·搽口紅·寫情書的掩護，又發揮牠另一特殊的效能。</p>
<p>此外還有魔術家的扇子，舞一女們跳裸體舞的桃花扇，及自鳴超人的隱世人主的鵝毛扇也都有他們各自不同的效用。</p>
<p>可是這裏却要說一個羣扇之雄的扇子，牠非獨使上述諾扇失色，即使鐵扇公主的風火扇，濟公活佛的神扇再行出世，也不能不讓牠三分，那就是被人丟棄在火爐旁邊的破芭蕉扇，別小視了牠，牠雖不聲不響却能使爐內星星之火變爲熊熊之火，燃着堆堆荳箕煎熬同根而生的荳實，使兄弟反目，同室操戈終於兩敗俱傷，然後牠坐獲其利，再在旁邊發出勝利的奸笑。但牠日常均藏匿在牠主人的背後，候機發動，只須你爐內微起火星，牠立即大顯身手，使小火變為大火，大火變爲不可熄減之火，煎熟整釜的荳，焚燬你家具乃至你整個的屋產。牠不受寒暑四時的拘束，隨時隨地均能發揮牠的威力，而牠的主人是陰險奸惡的人，時時在某人的背後煽動。使被煽的人受到莫大的損害。</p>
<p>現在正是夏季，也是扇孑最一多的節季，市面上陳列着各色各樣的扇子，都各有所用，惟有這種扇子你却要十分注意着，因為牠的主人是人，是圑體，是機關，是國家，牠躲在這些主人背後是使你防不勝防的，警惕着切莫議牠的風吹到你的身上，否則定會引起不可思議的惡果。</p>

<h3>武漢之夏　想像到「屋島人魚」</h3>
<p>— 乃心</p>
<p>從七月一日起一連下了五天大雨，長江水步步高陞，至七日止水位已增至二四·七一六公尺。據重慶電稱：重慶兩日間共漲十八公尺，萬縣兩日間共漲八公尺，看情形，雖然雨已停，但漢口三四天後當又大漲。有人說：這次大雨是受比基尼島原子彈的影響，其實這是在爲原子彈作義務宣傳，非常荒謬的，因爲在七月一日以前武漢氣候燥熱，爲大雨之徵兆，凑巧七月一日表演原子彈，大雨也來了，這只是巧合而已。憑東方式的氣象學家們說；長江每隔二十年鬧一次大水，民國二十年鬧了一次，照理說：今年還不到時候，不過大自然是常同人類開玩笑的，你說它不來嗎？它偏來了。今年氣候反常，加之在淪陷期間沿江老垸多年失修，殘破不堪，因此四十年的大水災很可能提早於今年再來一次的。</p>
<p>道幾天的漢口是緊張的。江漢工程局實行緊急時期整日辦公。各機關團體組織了一個防汎委員會，天天開會，忙得手脚都亂了。堤閘準備封了，抽水機準備好了，下水道口快封閉了……可是經費呢？彼此推諉，迄今尚無一文。善後救濟總署湖北分署長周蒼柏先生昨天在會議席上說：「希望大家有錢的出錢，有力的出力，發動全市市民都來防汎。我們分署是沒問題的，不過錢是外國人的錢，我們作不了主，所以希望各位先出錢，必要時我們一定作後援。因爲這是關係全漢口市民生命財產的事。有人設：救濟分署是善後救濟總署，只管「善後救濟的」。</p>
<p>民二十年的大水災「屋島人魚」的慘狀還有人記得的。大街上水深丈餘，全市只剩露着樓頂，從樓窗裏爬出來乘划子……但願長江小姐不要發脾氣吧！</p>
<h3>廬山追懷</h3>
<p>— 兆西</p>
<p>天氣酷熱，深夜獨坐小院，仰看天際白雲卷舒，看吐殘月，意態甚是閒散，這時雖然微風不動，心中倒感覺非常寗靜。因看天際白雲，便憶起夏季避暑聖地的廬山。</p>
<p>廬山的美麗，眞非筆墨所能形容。八年不履其境的我，每逢盛夏，依舊深深的戀念她。深不僅僅有高峻的峯　，幽奇的澗壑，雄壯的瀑布，和點綴其間許多古跡名勝而已，我最嚮往的還是雲，古今詩人咏她的很多，可惜我都不</p>
<p>廬山的雲，詭奇變幻，住居山中的人，恍若置身海市蜃樓，不可捉摸。夏季山中，避暑的人多集中於牯嶺一帶。戰前的牯嶺，眞是富麗紛華已極，外國人在此的很多，牯嶺街上，十足異國情調，環饒於牯嶺四週，數不清的各型各類的富人別墅，嵌鑲於山林叢碧之間，就如同綠樹上點點的花朶，入夜電燈通明，有若繁星。</p>
<p>二十六年發動全面抗戰，廬山便是決策地，猶憶七七盧溝橋日寇發難之後，接着天津也打起來了，當時情勢嚴重，舉國震憾，最高統帥駐節廬山，慎靜觀察局勞，表示「和平未至絕望時期，決不放棄和平；犧牲未到最後關頭，決不輕言犧牲。一時廬山將星雲集，萬方視綫均集中於此。迨後統帥決策己定，宜佈全面抗戰，隨即啓節下山，而八一三淞滬大戰跟着爆發，神聖抗戰序幕就這樣揭開了。</p>
<p>聽說廬山現在擬闢與世界公園，本月內中樞各長官將駐廬山辦公；夏令營也在十五日開幕了。名山偉業，眞是使人景仰呵！</p>

<h3>談翻譯工作</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>近來常在坊間看見許多翻譯的小說，讀起來似懂非懂。本來翻譯文藝作品的技巧是要能夠傳神。這點在翻譯上和社會背景。駕駛翻譯者對於這些弄不清，他自己就領略不到其中的神韻，更如何能購傳給別人呢？還有許多關於理論書籍的翻譯往往也是使讀者如　五里霧中，不但是似懂非懂，簡直是莫名其妙。此地我們以爲翻譯理論作品的技巧不在傳神而在傳真。這一點其實並沒有傳神難，可惜往往翻譯理論作品的人自己并沒有完全了解他所翻譯的作品，請問他的翻譯又怎能使別人了解呢？</p>
<p>中國翻譯界發以發生這種現象，我們只要略加分析，便不難找出它的原因。原來在中國擔任翻譯工作的人大體可以歸納成兩種。一種是「翻譯匠」，他們對於某國文字頗能精通，於是凡是用這種文字寫的著作他都拿來翻，不官是小說也好，是經濟也好，是哲學也好。他們是靠翻譯為主的。還有一種是初學者，他們是專門學習某一個部門的，為着自己學習方便或爲着急於介紹的熱忱，他們就把一種名著冒然拿來翻譯，而未曾反躬自問：是否已能運用翻譯的工具？是否已經精通所翻的內容？他們是靠翻譯來做研究的入門。</p>
<p>我們認爲這種現象是要得的。我們需要中國的專家擔任一部分翻譯工作。我們知道中國的學術界需要創造，同時我們以為中國學術上的創造需要外國文化的培養和滋潤。否則折衷創造乃是脆弱而貧乏的。因此，翻譯工作的重要不下於創造。我們希望精通外國文字而於某一部門有專門研究的專家對對於該一部門的名著多多的介紹到中國來。</p>
<p>同時希望中國的出版界多多的歡迎這一類的翻譯，不要太生意眼，略爲本國做些文化工作。</p>
<h3>評「美國外交政策論」</h3>
<p>— 孫杭</p>
<p>美國李普曼著　羅吟圃譯</p>
<p>重慶大時代書局出版</p>
<p>研究美國外交的人，都說美國的外交政策是一只鐘擺。鐘擺忽而盪左，忽而盪右，就是美國人忽而孤立，忽而和世界合作。</p>
<p>至今有許多人對此政策表示遺憾。有的甚至說，美國鐘擺在第一次大戰後擺回了孤立，辜負了威爾遜總統的菩薩心腸而否決了加入國聯的提議，是第二次大戰的原因之一。假使那時候，美國就和世界合作，加入國聯，主張一點正義，那末，極權國家也不敢挺而走險，世界也可省了許多生命財產。</p>
<p>但美國鐘擺如此一擺，也有一層好處，就是美國經過了大戰的滄桑，深受了這種政策的苦痛，到現在，這只擺便不再會擺回去了。許多美國的前進份子，固然早已了解國際整個和平的需要以及美國的不能置身事外，即一般廣大的民衆，也漸漸對孤立主義表示厭棄而傾向於世界的合作。因爲，美國人如果再潔身自好，原子彈不久就要飛到華盛頓了。</p>
<p>爲此，美國的外交政策，便必須重加檢討，踏上一個革命的階段。他的任務，一面保持美國旣成的領導世界的地位和榮譽，一面更要設法維特國際間的眞誠合作和和平。</p>
<p>政治家　兼政論家</p>
<p>李普曼先生（Walter　Lippmann））近著「美國外交政策論」（U．S．ForeignPolicy)一書，對此很有警闢的言論和切實的貢獻。李氏是一個政治家，也是一個蜚聲海內外的政論家。第一次大戰後有名的威爾遜十四條，據說李氏也是幕後執筆者之一」</p>
<p>美國外交政策論是薄薄的一本小書，但內容充實言無虛發，旣切時弊，又多建樹，所以暢銷美國，幾乎成了家傳戶曉的基太讀物。重慶大時代書局曾出版羅吟圃譯本，譯筆很流暢，上海各警局也有出售。</p>
<p>這本書分做兩部分，第一部是檢討過去，其中闡述美國近半世紀來外交政策的游移和矛盾。第二部是作者對今後政策的意見，其中極力鼓吹美國人應和世思合作，不該再守孤立。</p>
<p>全書的　中心思想</p>
<p>貫串全書的中心思想？便是。「美國如何負起她的國外責任（Foreign　Conmmitinent）」一八二三年，門羅總統發表了美洲是美洲人的美洲後，美國便開始有了國外的責任。美國為防止列強勢力侵入南美洲，她必須具備一種實力，足以担負這一種責任。其後，美國又在太平洋上伸展勢力，一八九九年西班牙割讓菲律賓後，她的責任擴展到離開本土六七千海里的地方。</p>
<p>但美國的爲政者，只是把責任担起來，沒有充實她的實力，以和責任均衡。美國人在世界會議中主張軍縮，又容忍日本人在太平洋中心構築和美國人爲敵的防禦工事，還不是和關切的朋友尤其是英國作對而認爲勝利，這些，直接間接地减削了美國的實力和帮助，便使美國在這次大戰中幾乎有了崩裂的危險。</p>
<p>實力是　軍備盟友</p>
<p>所以，李氏以爲，美國人要負起國外的責任，必先要有與資任相適應的實力。這個實力，一方而是廣大的軍備，一方而是衆多的友人。李氏說：「一個人對抗衆人是危險的，但站在衆人方面來對抗個人却就是安全」。他以爲這次大戰中，德國的初期勝利，便是因爲她能和蘇聯締結了協定，又小心培養了美國的孤立主義。環繞着日本的是蘇聯，中國，英國，荷蘭和美國，但道些國家沒有一個是她的朋友，她的唯一的盟邦是遠水不救近火的總國，因此，她便命定地失敗了·</p>
<p>美國要找到了衆多的盟邦，才能負起那些國外的責任，爾這，正是外交的使命。</p>
<p>四國組　核心同盟</p>
<p>李氏在最後，因此竭力主張美英蘇中（假使中國强盛的話）四國應組織核心同盟，作爲奠定世界和平的基石。李氏允强調美國和英國聯合的必然和必要，其論調和邱吉爾眞是同曲同工。</p>
<p>不過，這本書是專門寫給美國人看的，因此立論都從美國着想。我們中國人讀他，有些地方，便不免稍有隔膜之感，而談到了擴張軍備，負起責任，尤覺心悸肉跳。</p>
<p>中國人　幾點意見</p>
<p>我們對於李普曼先生奉勸美國人拋棄孤立政策一點，是十分佩服的，但以一個中國人的資格或是以一個愛好和平的世界主義者的資格，對於李氏的外交政策論，有幾點是必須提出討論的：</p>
<p>一，美國的國外責任，距離本土達六七千海里，而且李氏更說及，中國的領土完整，主權獨立，幾乎也是責任之一。美國能負起這龐大的責任，固然是給予世界的恩惠和幸福。但如寶力不及而硬要負起這責任，便只有使世界紛亂而鼓爭不止。所以，美國的外交政策，除了要設法負起這種責任外，更要設法减輕這　責任以與實力相稱。李氏見不及此，未免令人遺憾。</p>
<p>二、國外責任是一個微妙的名詞·當李氏說及中國是美國國外資任之一時，我們不知李氏是吾把中國當作三年前的菲律濱還是當作一個急待帮助的苦難的朋友。說得更透澈一點，美國勞力在太平洋上的進展展，是否將擴展到亞洲大陸以至於中亞細亞，美國對於中國的允諾和善意的帮助，我們是銘感於心，一刻不忘的。但當她的責任在漸漸擴張而和其他國家的責任相遇的時候，我們便爲世界的和平擔心了。</p>

<h3>鋼鐵是怎樣煉成的？</h3>
<p>— 鄭家璦</p>
<p>一人最寶貴的東西是生命，生命於我們祇有一次而已，一個人的生命是應當這樣渡過的，當他回首往事時，他不因虛度年華而後悔，也不因為過去的碌碌無能而羞恥——這樣他在臨死的時候，就能說：「我整個的生命與精力，都已獻給世界上最壯麗的事業——為人類的自由和解放而作鬥爭」。」道是尼可萊·奧斯托洛夫斯基（H．A．Ostrovski）在他的鉅作「鋼鐵是怎樣煉成的？」裏面，借了主角保爾的口吻，所說的話。</p>
<p>奧斯托洛夫斯基是一位蘇聯的天才作家，他寫過二部長篇小說：「鋼鐵是怎樣鍊成的？」和「從暴風雨裏所誕生的」這二個命名和題材，正就是他整個生命的象徵——他從苦難中生長大，他又剛强地站立起來像鋼鐵一樣堅靱。他在革命期中飽受到創傷，由盲目而殘廢，因此他的作品都是口授，由別人筆錄下來的。</p>
<p>「鋼鐵是怎樣鍊成的？」是奧氏第一部作品，在一九三二年出版，書出後就立刻轟動整個蘇聊文壇，七年之中，曾再版過一百次，售出數量約有三百五十萬册，並譯成各國文字，也攝製過電影（不久以前在上海上演過的。）一九三五年作者因了這部小說得到蘇聯政府榮譽的「列寗」勳章。</p>
<p>本書所寫是一九一七到一九二二年，蘇聯內亂時期，一個年靑的布爾塞維克光榮鬥爭的過程。故事開始的時候，保爾，可却金祇有十二歲，他因不受學校的歡迎，便輟學到火車站的廚房內工作，在那裏生活了兩年，他開始知道世界上許多不合理的，醜陋的事情，不久革命開始了，保爾對於這個動亂時代，很發生興趣，也曾偷偷地做了一些百以爲勇敢的事，有一次，他爲了營救一個水兵，被關禁在牢獄裏，結果，終以他的急智，出死入生，此後他便決心參加英勇的國內戰，這期間遭受到好多次重傷，但始終不氣餒，堅持到底，直到戰後的建設和政治工作爲止。故事發展中，也有輕鬆的情節那就是保爾和冬娓亞戀愛的日子，冬妮亞是造林所長的女兒，思想未免不澈底，尤其她安閒的個人主義使保爾厭倦：他們之間的友誼後來便漸漸疏淡起來了。</p>
<p>書中的保爾，實在就是作者目己的化身，內容也完全根據眞實的經騐，所以寫來逼眞而又生動，他的風格是屬於直截，剛强一方面的，然而通過了藝術的渲染，許多塲而就顯得很綺麗，纖和；尤其常保爾和冬妮亞相識的一段時期，作者在心理分析方面，用了細膩的筆法，非常引人入勝；同時技巧的卓越，布局的緊凑，簡直難以令人置信，這是由口述，別人替他筆錄下來的。奧斯托洛夫斯基的作品，除了文藝上的貢獻外；對於年靑人有更有力的啓示：生命决不是脆弱的；在大時代的冶爐裏，如果有了堅忍的意志，有了無盡藏的力量和熱情，他就一定可以和鋼鐵同樣强靱，他决不像塵埃，會在瞬息之間消滅一盡。</p>
<p>這部小說譯成中文，全長有十二萬字左右，在書坊上，我們會見到過二個譯本：一是梅益所譯，新知書店出版；另外還有潮鋒出版社，由段洛夫和陳非璜的合譯本，比較起來，梅益的筆調流利些，讀起來亦較爲動人。</p>
<p>關於奧斯托洛夫斯基的身世，這裏略加簡短的介紹：一九〇四年九月廿九日，他誕生於烏克蘭和波蘭交田的伏林斯克省的雪柏托夫卡地方，這是一份貧寒的鐵路工人家庭，他的父親很早去世，母親在「大戶人家當廚娘，哥哥是火車站重廠的鐵工，他們一家人的生活，全靠了微薄的工資來維持的，奧氏六歲進初級小學，十二歲時就自己出外謀生，他牧過馬，在車站的飯廳中當過小茶房，做過小工，後來又當了一陣子小火夫和發電工人；十五歲時加入國內戰爭，在一次戰役中，他受了重傷，病愈後，繼續致力革命，一九一二一年由戰地歸來，他又參於建設和敎育工作，一九二七年初，得了半身不遂症，手足都不能動，同時眼睛又瞎了，這是他一生中最大的苦痛，到這時候，奧氏的軀幹雖已死亡了，可是他的心却依舊活躍着，他抱了决心，要把自己經歷過的往事，用文藝的言語傳遞出來；於是在一九二八年開始創作，他的第一部鉅作，一鋼鐵是怎樣鍊成的？」問世後，得到漪人的成功；一九三六年底（十二月二十日）就逝世了，但是第二部小說「從風雨中誕生的」尚未完成，可是書出後，同樣受到蘇聯讀者的熱烈歡迎，在逝世後的兩三年中，印行了四十版和一百五十萬册。</p>
<p>奧斯托洛夫斯基用了果决的精神，完成自己的著作，他曾說過：「沒有人能阻止我這樣做，我覺得只有工作的時候，我纔健康。」他又正如自己所過的話那樣：「我整個的生命與精力，都巳獻給世界上最壯歷的事業—爲人類的自由和解取而作鬥爭。」</p>

<h3>創作的準備</h3>
<p>— 著作：矛盾　納雅</p>
<p>愛好寫作的朋友，尤其是開始試筆的，很需要一本指示正確寫作方法的書籍，用以補助他的技能與修養。這裏，我向諸位介紹一本比較適常的書籍，那就是茅盾先生的「創作的準備」。</p>
<p>偉大的作家，不但是一個藝術家，而且同時是思想家——在現代，並且同時一定是不倦的戰士，他的作品，不但反映了現實，而且一貫着他那時代的人生問題和思想間題，他提出了解答。</p>
<p>這樣才能算是一個作家——有成就的作家，諸位初習寫作者，可用刻苦的死功夫去學習着，研究着，到成功爲止，時間，當然是須很多的。研究不是摹仿，研究是學習着手法，摹仿則是生吞活剝地剽襲其形骸。那麼應該怎樣學習呢？那就應從廣泛的誦讀到擇定的研究。</p>
<p>在初寫作的朋友，必須要基本的練習，認識你這作品的題旨與人物的胎育成熟，然後去搜集材料，那你定須遵守「取精用宏」四個字。應當把這些材料壓榨，精煉。</p>
<p>當你寫到一個人物時，必經多方面的觀察，要使這一「人物」說他是實在有的一位「我們的熟人」呢，倒又不是，然而「面熱」得很，「我們的然人」們中間都有「他」的影子，都有一點兒像「他」，但並不就是「他」。各人都有點像「他」，然而又不「全」像「他」，到處可以碰見「他」，然而不能指認「他」就是某。</p>
<p>像這樣的人物，才是成功了，例如大家熟悉的阿Q。</p>
<p>有了確當的人物，也得入一個「廣義的環境」，使他能在這環境中活的表現着。</p>
<p>得到了確當的人物和環境，在寫的前奏，就是編寫大網，可以有一個機會檢察一下自己的東西，是否充分，是否還有模糊之處。</p>
<p>寫作就是這樣要下苦工夫的，所謂「精心製作」，興「技巧上的研磨」，就是這麼一回事，並沒有取巧的妙法。</p>
<p>如果寫完了一篇作品，自己看看不滿意，而苦於自己不知道毛病在那裏，那麼不要灰心，煩惱；你可以照常用功，一方面却把這作品藏起來，隔了些時候，再拿來讀一遍，那就可看到了一些先前未曾自知的毛病。</p>
<p>最後寫作上，它堅决地說：「捷徑」或「秘訣」是沒有的。</p>
<p>我不多資累，希望愛好寫作的朋友，能把道書讀一遍，遵照着去做，自然會有成功的一天。</p>

<h3>友情的懷念</h3>
<p>— 薛天然</p>
<p>世明的確是個可愛的友人。我不時要想念他，爲了他的熱情眞誠，給我的感動委實太深了。</p>
<p>雖然，離別了，他的影子却始終還幌在我的心海裏，使我領受到世閒的友情是那麼的可貴與溫暖。</p>
<p>和世明相識還遠在廿七年的春間；當時，抗戰的互浪正轟轟烈烈地在汹湧澎湃着，我與他住在同一個游擊隊伍裏從事救亡工作。回溯起來，應該感到多麼的歉仄，因爲驕傲的緣故，對於像世明那樣並不負什麼責任的同志，我竟如此的亳不關心，以致等到相隔了五年以後再見的當兒，居然完全想不起來他是曾經和我同過一個月事的朋友，聽他有聲有色的描述我當時活躍的情景，內心不禁掠上了深深的慚愧。世明！我有什麼理由可以把你忽略而拒在接近的門外呵？</p>
<p>重逢以後，我們從此熱絡了。他彷彿女孩子對待她的情侶似的體貼，在生活上講我獲得了他太多的帮助，一大半的瑣屑事務全由他替我照顧和解決，使我在這個新的團體裘不用愁煩着到處的不便。頻頻的接觸中，有一天我忽然發覺了他的寫作才能，他似乎不曾受過好的學校敎育，但是，攤在眼前的詩和散文，明明是好像出於一個靑年作家的手筆，寫得動人而淸麗，辭藻又是數飾得秀美而漂亮，我驚奇了，發現奇蹟似的對着他滋生了敬意，好感</p>
<p>戰時的環境總是流離動盪的，不上半月功夫，我有事走了，而且恰巧在他被派往另一個鄉下去工作的時間，於是，連通知他都來不及，祗好留了封信悵然地與他分開了。</p>
<p>往後二年裏，生活起了極大的變化，僥倖的事情要算是世明終於再跟我住在一塊這一件了。同病是容易相憐的，我們在窮困中住在一起，消磨着一方面痛苦一方面樂觀的歲月，逐漸地我了解了世明的一切，包括了極其微細的地方，他明也絡續淸楚了我的性格和爲人。他情感豐富，待人眞正地捧了一顆赤誠的心腸來奉獻給你，他願意自巴吃苦，把較好的一份留給我來享受，尤其是經濟觀念，簡直是一絲一亳的自私性都不存在，不但是「他的就是我的」，而且他恨不得盡他的所有和所能有來換取我的高興和滿足，我接受過他好幾次援助，都是在我窘到頂點的塲合。他賣掉過僅有的衣服和羢衫，犧牲過他妹妹的金戒，整整奔波過一天向所有的朋友張羅凑成數目，爲了帮我克服接二速三的患難。寄寓在這個完全陌生的小城中的我，對於他這樣的忠心好義，當時候幾乎感激得我流出了眼淚，就是如今，我也不能用任何形容詞足以表示我出自內心的謝意。</p>
<p>世明比我大一歲，他的出身是一個綢莊的學徒，大時代的暴風雨降臨到中國的時候，他接受了新思想的啓蒙，跟其他的許多知識靑年一樣，隨着抗戰的展開，抱了滿腔的愛國熱忱，他踏止了戰地，投身在偉大的民族解放的激流里，世明不但慢慢地吸收了社會科學和哲學的知識，豐富了理論上的修養，同時汲取了無比寶貴的經騐和鍛鍊，造成了他一個敢作敢爲的鬥士。他以書記和政工隊員的工作崗位上終於跳上了科長和秘書的位置，正當他帶了喜悅與得意的心情去瞻望自巴的前程時，敵人殘酷的掃蕩和霹靂似地攻進了游擊區域，大批的工作人員撒退了，世明便是其中的一份子。</p>
<p>不久，世明關始在淪陷區出沒，而且住下來了。他和我形影相隨的時刻便在道一個階段。相互間都一貧如洗，打發每天的生活差不多完全依靠着借貸，其中有幾天甚至硬唱「空城計」以希望和歌聲硬着頭皮克服，飢餓的威脅。但是，環境雖是艱困到了極點，悲觀的陰影仍掩蓋不住我們的心田。一個單純的信念鼓舞着：因爲明天終要來到的，咬緊了牙關熬過今天，還怕勝利不屬於我們嗎？尤其是世明的樂觀，他似乎把任何困難都看得毫不介意，已經進行，正在進行，或者將要進行的事情，他沒有一件不認爲「絕對有把握。」「完全可能成功。」似地自信着，他養成了一種說話喜歡誇張的脾氣，並且到處流露着「自鳴得意」的阿〇式的習性，不過，這無損於一個對他十分熟悉的我的印象；環境太惡劣了，要在黑暗的地方堅持鬥爭下去，非具有最大的忍耐與毅力不可，世明的個性恰恰直接地增加了我的勇氣，抵抗住了乘隙而來的軟弱。</p>
<p>危險，挨餓，一件件地走過而且走遠了，生活誠然是一種鍛鍊，儘管在情緒十分不安當中，我們還讀了好幾本厚厚的理論書籍，茅盾的「腐蝕」，夏衍陳白　的許多劇本都是晚上睡不着覺而看完的，他們活像是一把新的火種塞進我和世明的心頭熊熊地燃起了光與熱。這小城也有話劇的演出，尭明看過了「葡萄美酒，」（即尤兢的夜光杯。）感情激動得非常利害，淍着眼淚向我說：「我也不怕犧牲，革命是需要以血的代價交換的。」我握着他的手，說：「祝福你成功。」祇覺得熱的電流，滾動不已。</p>
<p>四個月以後我的安全成了問題，接着就東躱西避地一直到敵人投降爲止，分了手的世明到今天我還得不着他的消息，但相信他定仍舊活着，更快樂更積極的活着。「在戰鬥和患難中建立起來的友誼是人間最珍貴的感情」。我不能忘懷世明，就因爲如此。他雖然也有不少缺點，但他更應當被看作是一個優秀，堅貞的中華民族的兒女。我要等待着那一天的來到，和世明緊緊地拉着手，暢訴離衷，傾吐我們的痛苦與歡笑。</p>
<h3>白日夢</h3>
<p>— 洛賽蒂（一八二八——一八八二）</p>
<p>陳冽於倫敦維多利亞博物館</p>
<p>洛賽蒂之父加波里，爲一義大利詩人，以政治關係逃亡英國，浪跡歐陸，後任敎於倫敦皇家學院。其子幼認庭訓，早年即顯露其藝術天才。一八四八年，氏二十歲時，與米蘭及享特等人共同發起所謂早期唯美遝動，於英國及歐洲之學術思潮，甚多影響。洛賽蒂之畫，不但忠實描寫自然之細微景象，且摻入一種深　的詩意表。現蓋洛氏不但爲一畫家，且亦一名詩人也。氏天性富幻想，但又能以一種實際之手法，描叙共空靈之夢幻。洛賽蒂之盡，大都係描寫中世紀故事，惟一八五七年，曾爲當時桂冠詩人丁尼生之詩集插盡。洛氏於水彩及油畫，皆屬名手。本幅「白日夢」，爲其名作之一。</p>
<h3>無夢之夜</h3>
<p>— 墨萸</p>
<p>當灰色的天幕掩蓋了這上海每一個角落裏的哀愁的時候，Ciros門口便開始瀰漫出瘋在的歡樂。白萍今天懷着異樣的情緒踏進了這座他已經非常熟悉的舞宮，他剛預備用人流中的熱情來冲刷他在路上爲一些憶念所侵蝕的苦痛時，大班在麥克風前已做着鬼臉提高了嗓子喊着：</p>
<p>「白萍小姐來啦！諸位要不要他唱一隻？」接着像一陣在巨谷裏激起的洪濤的共嗚，這天地似乎都被震動昏暈了，白萍屏着氣息看了看這室內帶着誘惑的淡藍色的光霧下，幾百隻誘惑的眼睛在狠命的盯住自己，一星期來經驗底煎熬使他不能不巷自己裝上微笑，於是他開始唱了：</p>
<p>「I　will　buy　that　dream　……long　ago　andfar　away，　I　dreamed　a　dream　one　day　andnow　that　dream　is　here　beside　me！……」「多甜的夢啊！」囂揚的氣氛裏祗要有一個人怪呌一聲，立刻就引起了一片廣大的騷動，因爲這是大家賣羿風情的機會，他們都貪婪的想在自萍身上找到各自渴求的夢，於是一曲纔完，白萍便在人流的裹挾中悠悠地邁開了夢一般的舞步。</p>
<p>白萍在轉過了八九隻　子以後，他才知道今天這許多陌生的舞客原來都是慈善家，他們是抱着莫大的熱誠來參加救濟蘇北難民義舞的。「蘇北難民」這幾個字無異對白萍的現實人生蘊藏着一種揭發性的諷刺，他怕因此而觸痛了這裏在華麗的衣飾中的受過劇創的靈魂，他竭力地使自己遺忘一切，把蒸發着笑意的肉體更貼緊了這已經是第十隻　子上的客人。</p>
<p>「白萍小姐的英文太好了！」這是一個將近中年的糾士型的陌生客人。</p>
<p>「人家　是不折不扣的大學生呢！」大班照例是要替舞女的張的。</p>
<p>「……」白萍憎厭地看了大班一眼，這種光榮的誇耀在他已認爲是一種對自己感傷的惡意的桃撥了；紳士們是聰明的，他們立刻會意地遣走了大班，於是轉變了方向朝着她靈魂的深處進攻！「我相信白萍小姐有着一個輕盈美麗的夢！」</p>
<p>「怎見得？」</p>
<p>「你剛纔不是唱過你在迢遙的往昔有一個夢，並且這個夢正偎依着你的身邊！……這個夢是不是允許我跨進它的邊緣，也和你一樣的佔有它，來　得一點溫馨的滋味呢？」</p>
<p>「你別誤會！我的夢境裏祗有辛酸與苦痛！」</p>
<p>「爲什麼？」</p>
<p>「八年抗戰使我那溫暖的家變成一個破落戶，於是我開始有了辛酸的夢，勝利後連這點僅有的破落戶的產業也被共產黨的砲火蕩光了；我不只沒有書讀，而且做了難民，現在我所有的祗是一個苦痛的夢！」</p>
<p>白萍又漸漸的開始她那習慣性的哽咽了，但是這裏的環境是不容許她有這種矛盾的傷感的；她祗一抬頭，看見一個西崽正在麥克風前激昂糠慨地喊着：</p>
<p>「諸位今天多吃一杯茶。就是多救了一條命！我們做這種下賤職業的生活雖然清苦，但是我們决忘不了那許多成千成萬過着流亡生活的蘇北難胞，所以我今天願意自動地獻出我一天的小賬和工錢，我要以個人的苦痛來換取他們成千成萬的人的快樂！」</p>
<p>一陣春雷似的掌聲喚回了白萍對夢境的惆悵，一種新的啓示盤旋在她的心頭，她彷彿立刻就堅定了一個新生的信念：</p>
<p>「我已經落在火坑裏了，我不能讓那許可多善良的人再重複一次我的足跡，現在不是我應該犧牲自己的時候嗎？」白萍想到這裏，很洗鍊地換上了一副非常適應這室內情調的微笑，這微笑是相當刺激而誘惑的，紳士型的陌生客人更靠緊了他：</p>
<p>「白萍小姐！痛苦可以堅定你的意志，辛酸也可以激發你的勇氣，你何必傷感呢？」</p>
<p>「是的，我現在已經有了勇氣和决心！」</p>
<p>「我今天也想學他們的樣讓那些千萬個難胞暫時擭得一點快樂和救濟！」</p>
<p>「你將要捐獻出你所有的一切？」</p>
<p>「是的，我預備現在開始向任何一個人義賣我的夢！」</p>
<p>白萍說完這句話時立起了身子，她整個的線條美，簡直就像一根蠕動的肉柱，（這肉柱裏面閃鑠着無限使人沉醉的活力；這些，配合了她剛纔那句逗人退想的聲明，立刻就展開了一幕熱烈而綺麗的競爭塲面，這紳士型的咨人已經早就立在麥克風前使勁地講着：</p>
<p>「諸位，我相信這是一個非常沉痛的喜訊！…」</p>
<p>室內充滿了一片難得的沉寂。</p>
<p>「白萍小姐現在願意向任何一位義賣她的夢！……她的夢雖然帶些辛酸，但是絕對完整的；她的夢雖然夾着苦痛，但是希望有那一位能給予她以快樂！因爲……因爲她今晚是要以更大的苦痛去換取千萬個穌北難胞的快樂的·」這位中年的紳士顯得被熱情激動得聲嘶力竭了，但是他還頑强地繼續下去：</p>
<p>「一個完整的夢是無法估計他的價値的，伺况這是一件偉大的義舉！所以我……我願意以二十萬元來……」</p>
<p>他還沒有能結束這句話，全塲已經哄起了歡呼的浪潮。</p>
<p>「我願意出五十萬！」</p>
<p>「我出一百萬！」</p>
<p>「我出……！」</p>
<p>沒有一點猶豫，沒有絲亳吝意的拍覺，在白萍的心頭織成了許多數不淸的酸甜苦辣的味覺，她知道自己在這種塲合已經變成商品的悲哀，但她終於在一個衰老而又臃腫的商人型的懷抱裏被拍出了最高售價：</p>
<p>「我願意捐出三百萬來救那些無告的難胞，同時我也願意捐出所有的力量來使她終生快樂！」這衰老的善士矜持地點了點頭。</p>
<p>這交易的成就給予在塲的人們許多不同角度的失望；大班帶着祝福而謟媚的聲調趨近白萍的身傍；</p>
<p>「你今晚真要救活不少人吶！」</p>
<p>「我有什麼資格去救人？我和那許多難民一樣地被人家救活了。」</p>
<p>樂台上重又奏起I　will　buy　that　dream的旋律，像是歡送白萍義舉的成功，又像是在傷悼白萍靑春的夭折，這舞池裏的空氣有一種說不出的矛盾。在人們以一種夢痕的殘滴悠悠地咀嚼着各自逝去的豪情時白萍被那臃腫而又衰老的商人型的紳士拉進了汽車：一你從此可以消失了往日裏的那些辛酸的夢寐了？」紳士親切地樓着白萍的腰肢。</p>
<p>「可是，這社會上不是正在不斷地製造着更新鮮的辛酸的夢境嗎？」</p>
<p>「不過，……不過你今夜至少不應該再想到那些使你痛苦的夢了。」</p>
<p>「是的，我今夜的夢已換來了千萬人的快樂，我是應該快樂的。」</p>
<p>「那千萬人的快樂間接地建築在你的苦痛的犧牲上，這種偉大的義舉你是可以自豪的！」衰老的紳士獻媚地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「也許吧……」白萍有點囁嚅了。</p>
<p>車窗外面輕　　飄拂着長夏的季節風，I　dreamed　a　dream　one　day，and　now　that　dream　is　here　be　siade　me的旋律給汽車拋遠了，白萍通過了晶瑩的淚珠，看淸楚了道整個的上海在車輪的烟塵中是一個無夢的今宵！</p>
<p>卅五，七，二十七速記。</p>

<h3>即景二章　上海少爺</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>蘇北難民救濟協會，現在決定舉行「上海小姐」的選舉以助賑，事關三百五十萬流亡者的活命問題，誰也沒有話說，當然十分贊成，不過義舞之後，又來「上海小姐」，似乎太偏勞女界同胞了，做男子的未免於心不安！</p>
<p>我很想建議救濟協會諸公，在「上海小姐」選舉之後，再來一次「上海少爺」或「上海公子」（名稱不妨再詳細研討一下）的逃舉，好在捐輸助賑，救濟爲上，多多益善。至於辦法，還是由協會諸公動動腦筋罷。</p>
<p>電影廣吿</p>
<p>抗戰以前，電影院的廣告最够刺激，有人說，那是地位關係，地位火，可以「擺噱頭」，其實，今日即使地位小，一樣够動人的。且在其中隨意舉幾個字句：</p>
<p>1載歌載舞施展渾身解數，玉腿如林滿天飛，妙曲選歌萬人迷。</p>
<p>2人體美的展覽，軟玉溫香，眼皮納凉；歌舞藝的昇華，蝕骨銷魂，心坎抓　。</p>
<p>3酸溜溜，熱烘烘，氣冲冲。</p>
<p>4乾柴烈火未婚弟婦看中大伯者心大動。</p>
<p>已經够了，不再舉了。</p>
<p>看電影可說今日最價廉物美的娛樂，可是我認爲假使你沒有錢或沒有功夫，你看看電影廣告也够娛樂的了。</p>
<h3>開不得的玩笑　警報突長鳴</h3>
<p>— 仲軍</p>
<p>星期日下午六點多鐘，我正在一個親戚家裏，準備吃晚飯。警報響了，我們都聽得很淸楚。無論如何，這個時間是不會放警報的。有人說是警報器出毛病；但是，聲音很長，始終不停。而接着另一個警報聲又響了起來。於是，我們不得不開開無綫電，想聽聽這倒底是怎麼一回事。可是，無綫電裏正在大奏音樂，除了廣告以外，沒有任何報告。</p>
<p>每個人都覺得緊張起來。這實在莫怪我們。所有在上海或內地的人都親身經歷過警報是怎麼一回事。而且，我們都曉得華沙，倫敦，甚至珍珠港都遭遇過這種突如其來的警報。一個剛剛離開戰爭的人不會那樣快就忘掉了戰爭的恐怖。於是，電活打出去了。但是沒有人曉得這是怎麼一回事，連治安當局在內。</p>
<p>緊張的空氣更加濃厚了！</p>
<p>我突然抓住一個靈感，立刻宣佈：「假使這是警報的話，那應該是解除警報！因爲只有解除警報才會一長聲到底，空襲警報是應該一長兩短的。」人們仔細一想，覺得很有道理。而這時候晚飯開出來了，吐着泡沬的啤酒使我們整個忘掉了這一聲警報。</p>
<p>第二天翻開報紙，才曉得是電綫壞了；市民不知究竟，徒然虛驚一塲云云。說得那麼輕鬆，好像在說一般人連警報器出毛病的知識都沒有似的。</p>
<p>我覺得我們並不神經過敏。如果這一聲警報在歐美的大都會裏響了起來，恐怕連不知究竟的警察都要勸人進防空洞了。並不是我們的心裏有着戰爭的影子，在這個時代裏，人們不得不防備一些看起來幾乎是不可能的意外。而擔負着把驚告傳佈給全市市民的繁報器，如果也開上一兩次玩笑的話，其可怕的後果是不難想像的。</p>
<p>警報器是和敎堂裏的鐘一樣神聖而正確的東西。他支配着全市的行動；他決不會，也決不能亂　！</p>
<p>所以，當警報器囚故障而自動　了起來的時候，應該採取一切手段，立刻切斷電流；無論加何，不能讓牠連續發聲至十分鐘之久。同時必須立刻電告治安當局，好籍廣播電台，警車，或其他可能方法通知市民勿事驚慌；無論如何，不能讓人們在幾十分鐘以後還不明白這究竟是怎麼一回事。而且，事後也決不能不聲不嚮就算了！至少要發一張佈告，說明原委，並且爲了防範未來，應該告訴市民怎樣去分別眞正的警報和「意外的警報」。</p>
<p>這不是小題大做。誰都知道那謊叫「狼來了！狼來了！」的故事，警報器關繫着全市的安全，他是不能謊叫一次的！</p>
<h3>咄咄怪事</h3>
<p>— 一粟</p>
<p>你如果有機會到故都—北平去的話，在電車裏面，一定可以看到有兩種典型人物，祗須把頭一搖，或是一點，那賣票員就心照不宣地PASS渦去了。决不要破鈔買票。他們在電車上的專門名詞是「搖頭票」和「點頭票」。可是你得有特殊的資格。有時也有人想冒充，把頭似搖似點的動了一動，希岡PASS，但那賣栗員的眼光很是利害，看他旣不像×××，又不像白相人，他一定會大聲地向那人詢問，老兄，你到底是搖頭票？還是點頭票？</p>
<h3>書法展覽</h3>
<p>— 李菊淸</p>
<p>日昨應友人之約，聞寗波同鄉會有書法家任慈祥個展，筆者久慕其名，特於午後驅車往訪，見四壁鬆有不少聯軸扇卷，正草隸篆，各體具有，寫來枯潤互用，都能恰到好處。</p>
<p>經友人介紹，始得識荊，任君謙恭溫厚，和藹可親，每有所問，必諄諄以告，問及所學，據任君自述，學書數十年，惟有摹仿古人，體味古人，默想前代名賢作事，誠懇，不求倖致，孜孜矻矻，得享盛名，予每臨池，心　神往，所恨天資愚鈍，不能追踪古人耳。</p>
<p>且研究書法，尤須注重品性，古人云，文以載道，詩以言志，讀書明聖賢之理，書法乃發人個性而流露於形質也。蓋藝之精深者，亦可於筆氣中觀人賢達不肖。譬之其人忠厚，其書必樸實穩重，其人浮滑，其書必輕薄飄率；放達者豪邁，規矩者準繩，趨時者媚麗，高潔者質逸。此不移之理，故書法盛衰，亦與國運攸關，大足以移風易俗，昌明國運，小亦可供文字研討，補經史不足。至於藝之工拙，實爲其次也。聞斯數語，蓋可以見其平生研究矣。</p>
<h3>「聰明」與「傻瓜」</h3>
<p>— 凌捉煙</p>
<p>以學生而論，在上課時偸看小說，黃色週報·電影雜誌。寫淸盡，或者請人代到而出去看電影，玩舞塲。讀　會跳級，文憑會用錢去買，老試時會「Pass」會抄書，臟夾帶，這是「聰明」的學生。</p>
<p>上課時用心聽講，下課時用功　書，不會跳舞，不會談情說愛，憑着真才實學考試，按步就班一級一級升級的都是「傻瓜」</p>
<p>會修飾，愛打扮，以輕顰淺笑去贏得愛情，以豪華的舉止和衣飾去贏利愛慕。年色衰老了，丟棄一個，再娶一個。財盡勢衰了，離掉一個，再嫁一個。這是頂「聰明」的談愛說情方法，最「新式」的結婚格式。</p>
<p>什麼互相了解，志趣相同，同甘共苦，白首偕老，這些都是「便子」幹的玩意兒。</p>
<p>利用你時，便肝胆相交，恩至義盡，用不着你的時候，便棄如敝展，視如路人，這是頂「聰明」交友之道。</p>
<p>什麼交友以忠信，患難相共，這些都是「傻瓜」！</p>
<p>在社會上，會交際賄賂，會吹牛拍馬，會鑽營奔走，會避重就輕，識時務，見風駛舵，損人利己，對上則卑躬屈膝，阿諛謟媚，對下則威風凜凜，架子十足，這是「聰明人」處世之道！</p>
<p>舞弊揩油，假公濟私是「聰明人」。</p>
<p>奉公守法，忠於職守，守正不阿的是天下第一「傻瓜」！</p>
<p>私底下囤積居奇，作奸犯科，而表面上却裝得仁至義盡，忠於國，忠於民，大興慈善機關，公衆事業，普救衆生，爲大衆謀福利，因此而昇官發財，位居顯要的，這是偉大的「聰明人」！</p>
<h3>不值一笑</h3>
<p>— 本惠</p>
<p>醫生：「連日的打針怎麼到現在還不能殺盡你身體內的細菌？」</p>
<p>病人：「那末可否請醫生注射些DDT因爲這是殺虫唯一的聖藥一定能馬上奏效的」</p>
<p>父：「你道不上進的東西竟學起跳舞來了」</p>
<p>子：「爸！我去學跳舞亦爲的是蘇北災民因爲此次舉行義務跳舞可以救濟災民的！」</p>
<h3>「民隱」與「官隱」</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>廣東行營政治部，最近召集廣州各同業商會舉行一次座談會，到各同業商會四十四個單位，代表五十餘名；主席要他們不客氣地說出他們各業所體騐到的痛苦和困難，不論是政治上的或者是在他們本身上的。結果所得的結論完全是歸納在政治上頭，政治上頭所引致到的痛苦與困難是貪汚—一法立，一弊生；是苛捐雜稅—礦區要稅，礦產品要稅，營業也要稅，稅之不已；是走私—有組織的走私：洋捲煙源源免稅入口，打擊土製煙的銷路，招致土製煙廠有三分二以上的倒閉；……·主席認爲道是寶貴的資料，謂將轉呈張行營主任請示，務求解决各業的痛苦。</p>
<p>政治部召集這種座談的意義據說是秉承張行營主任的意旨，想消除「過去下情很少上達」的隔膜，「想明白：一·目前經濟情况的不景氣應如何解决；二·物資流通困難的所在；現在稅捐征踝能否合理與便民；三·爲免除勞資糾紛，加强雙方聯絡，與推行福利事業種種應如何幹去。」當然，上述三點也是含有政治性的，但各同業商會代表們所陳述的却和這種政治性相反的很多，是張主任所預擬想明白的更進一步，這不由得不使主席（政治部主任秘書謝鎭南）認爲寶貴的資料了。</p>
<p>其實這種寶貴的資料在廣州是「俯拾即是」的，也許不祗是廣州，大中華民國的領土內又那一處沒有這種寶貴的資料？不過適逢其會的被謝主任聽取到其中的幾千分之幾罷了。但，謝主任認是寶貴的資料可知行營的政治部是有意探查民隱。却料不到所探查到的乃是「官隱」。這可想像得出勝利後的廣州又如何在瀘種「官隱」的水深火熱裏面！</p>
<p>勝利帶給廣州的老百姓許是以前並沒有過的勇氣吧！在好些月前胆敢拆去善救分署的招牌，如今又胆敢在官的面前揭發「官隱」。頂够動是「一法立，一弊生」這句話兒，直然指出官要生一弊則去立一法；其次是汽運轍業隱約指出那些「覇土」乘車不付錢，載貨不付錢。尤其菸草商說明無稅洋煙的源源進口，是有組織的走私。他們這些天胆的控訴原就是官兒們耳熟能詳的事情。然而能够在報章披露總算「民主」得多了（？）。</p>
<p>廣州工商業在那次座談裏可以說是服了一貼輕性的瀉劑，胸中的積滯在會塲的空氣上看來也可以說是已然得到滌蕩一下腸胃了。可是道些控訴有沒有發酵作用則要有待於將來事實的證明，那是請示了張主任之後的「務求解决」·許是廣州的工商業現在很躭心，躭心他們所提供的祗被認爲「寶貴的資料」，「寶貴」到珍藏起來，連將來的公開也沒有機會。</p>
<p>廣州的工商業眞令人百二十分同情，勝利以來的十個月期間，所受的種種委屈寶非此中人不能道，尤其在勝利初期的政治紛亂中的種種刮削·現在行營政治部創開這種政治作風，我想，總不會使人失望的吧？</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] Marshal Ma has not yet invited Zhou Enlai for a meeting today. His residence is also quiet. In the reception room of the Communist Party delegation, visitors waiting for news are filled with a heavy atmosphere. Everyone wonders whether Marshal Ma has any mission or opinion at all, and why he came down the mountain so suddenly. If he does have opinions, why hasn't he arranged to meet Zhou Enlai? According to precedent, Marshal Ma always conveys the results to the Communist Party after contacting the government. According to observers: today's situation shows signs of deterioration. The changes in Yunnan are not due to what Marshal Ma brought from Lushan. On the contrary, they were caused by the opinions of the Communist Party that Marshal Ma brought to Lushan. The success of the negotiations depends on the concessions of both sides. However, now that the government has repeatedly made concessions, it still has not promoted the reopening of political negotiations, which must have its reasons. Therefore, some people speculate that the opinions submitted by the Chinese Communist Party to Marshal Ma for transmission to the government must have exceeded the limits that the government can tolerate and concede. These rumors are not groundless. Today, there is also an unusual event: Marshal Ma invited American journalists for a meeting at noon, reportedly to solicit their opinions on the current situation in China. However, the whole thing is kept secret, and outsiders have no way to find out. Even the American journalists who attended the meeting were forbidden to send telegrams or disclose any opinions. Therefore, everyone believes that this gathering is the most thought-provoking event in the current depressed atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] It is said that Marshal Ma will return to Lushan within a few days. According to someone, Marshal Ma's return is possible because Ambassador Stuart has been away from Nanjing for a long time, and no one is taking care of the embassy affairs. Moreover, transportation is very convenient, so he is returning to Nanjing for a trip, which may not be related to the negotiations. According to someone's speculation, the situation may not have deteriorated so drastically.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] After Marshal Ma returned to Nanjing, the National Government's Staff Officer Pi visited him at eight o'clock this morning, but did not meet him. In the morning at ten o'clock, Mr. Brucker, Counselor of the American Embassy, visited to inquire about Ambassador Stuart's illness. At 6:15 PM, Dean Long Yun also visited for an hour. According to the Communist Party, although Zhou Enlai has not received an invitation by telephone, Zhou will decide to visit him on the 1st on his own initiative. It is also heard that Marshal Ma's return to Nanjing this time is due to the issue of the American army in Tianjin. He plans to handle it in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 31st Telegram] Ambassador Stuart's condition has improved. This morning, he had beef juice. The Chairman's attending physician and the American military doctor both emphasized that the ambassador needs to rest urgently. Reporters stationed in Guling from various Shanghai newspapers came to the American Embassy to express their concern about the ambassador's condition today. Ambassador Stuart told his secretary on the afternoon of the 31st: His illness has recovered, and he feels uneasy about resting himself while others are working hard. Therefore, he hopes to get up and visit the Chairman on the 1st. He expressed his willingness to sacrifice himself and serve the world, humanity, and the two countries, China and the United States. Although the doctor's orders still require him to rest for three to five days, if possible, he will definitely visit Chairman Chiang on the 1st and have the first formal meeting after coming to Guling again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 31st Telegram] Chen Fang, Director of the National Government's Political Affairs Bureau, told reporters today that he denied that the three-person meeting would be moved to Guling.</p>
<h3>Although the Communist Army Launched a Full-Scale Offensive, the Government Will Not Give Up Peace: Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 AM on the 31st, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a transcript of Minister Peng's answers: (1) Regarding the military situation: In northern Jiangsu, contact is maintained north of Gaoyou. The Communist army's attack on Luhe has been repelled. The National Army has advanced to Tianchang and north of Xuyi. In northern Anhui, the Communist army's attack on the west of Suining has been repelled. Sixian and Wuhe are in the hands of the National Army. In Shanxi, the Communist army concentrated ten regiments to attack Datong. (2) Regarding the political situation: Because their army began a full-scale offensive, peace negotiations made no progress. In addition to military activities, the Chinese Communist Party continued various destructive actions, such as destroying railways and economic blockades. This policy is what the German-language newspapers in China call "rule or chaos." However, the government will not give up its efforts to resolve the issue peacefully. (3) Regarding Gu Weijun's speech in the United States: I have not seen the original text. I am unable to comment, but the term "civil war" should not be used to describe the current situation in China. To put it correctly, one side is the Chinese Communist Party, which is attempting to seize power by force, but its military strength is inferior. Therefore, it adopts various strategies, such as mass propaganda, psychological warfare, and economic blockade to disrupt transportation, in order to create the greatest chaos and increase the chances of a communist revolution. The other side is the Chinese government, which is trying its best to find a political solution, but cannot avoid the responsibility of maintaining domestic security and order. When attacked, it must resist. For example, the conflict in Shandong was caused by the Communist Party's occupation of Dezhou during the truce. The conflict in northern Jiangsu was due to the Communist army's attack on Taixing. Every time the National Army resists the Communist army's attack, the Chinese Communist Party will shout loudly that a "civil war" has begun. Three days ago, more than 300 Communist army soldiers in plain clothes ambushed the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. The government sent troops to disperse them. I know that the Chinese Communist Party will accuse the government of "civil war." The other day, the Communist army opened fire on American Marines on the Pingjin Highway, causing many deaths and injuries. The National Army's guard troops rushed to attack them. This will again be evidence of "civil war." (4) Regarding the Communist army's attack on American naval personnel on the Pingjin Highway, the government has received a preliminary report. We are deeply shocked by this atrocity. We will thoroughly investigate and punish this unfortunate incident, which clearly shows the Chinese Communist Party's concept of democracy and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st Telegram] Minister Peng Xuepei is scheduled to fly to Xunyang tomorrow morning and then go to Guling.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Watches a Play</h3>

<h3>He Yingqin's Speech in the United States: The CCP is Unwilling to Obtain Peace Quickly; Attacks on the American Army are to Sabotage Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco Radio: Washington News: General He Yingqin said that when he went to the Northeast for inspection, he found that the Soviet Union had transported all the machines and materials in the aircraft and automobile factories. However, he was unwilling to disclose the figures of what the Soviet Union had taken away. The ambush of the US Marines by the Communist army between Pingjin had no other meaning except to sabotage highway transportation. Their army tried to destroy highways and railways to hinder China's restoration and to overwhelm the government with problems. He also accused the CCP of being unwilling to reach a peace agreement quickly, saying that their failure to comply with the military reorganization plan was clear evidence. The CCP still does not intend to reduce its troops to the minimum limit stipulated in the agreement in January of this year. So far, the government knows that the CCP's weapons are mostly obtained domestically. When asked if the Communist army could occupy Shanghai, he replied: "No."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th Telegram] General He Yingqin pointed out today that the CCP wants to create a state of no good elements in order to take the opportunity to overthrow the government and establish an authoritarian regime. He said: The CCP's attempt is very obvious, that is, to destroy the national economy, prevent the United States from mediating China's disputes, and overthrow the government based on the so-called proletarian dictatorship theory. When asked about Madame Sun Yat-sen's statement that "Chinese and American reactionaries are trying to create a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union," he said: "Madame Sun Yat-sen has taken an anti-government attitude since 1928. I believe her observations are only her personal opinions." He also said: He believes that the US military must remain in China until the Japanese army is completely disarmed and repatriated.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Group in Laohekou Completed a Mediation Agreement; It Has Been Sent to the Military Mediation Department Awaiting Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th Telegram] The Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department, which was previously reported missing in Xi'an, is now in Laohekou. In their long silence, they have completed a mediation agreement on the conflict between Li Xiannian's troops and the National Army. The content roughly stipulates that the Communist army will no longer advance, and the National Army will no longer pursue. Both sides will withdraw about ten miles from the current conflict line, and there are also provisions for the food supply of Li Xiannian's troops. This agreement has now been sent to the Military Mediation Department, awaiting approval from the three members. However, whether this agreement can be implemented is still a question, because the radio telegrams sent by the group to Li Xiannian in Laohekou have not received a reply, and formal contact has not been established. The group and the Thirty-second Group are expected to return to Beiping in early next month to report everything to the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st Telegram] Regarding the previous report of the disappearance of the Ninth Executive Group, according to news, the group was originally scheduled to fly to Xi'an with the Thirty-second Group on the 25th of this month. Later, in order to make a final effort, it was temporarily decided to stay in Laohekou for two days to wait for Li Xiannian's representative. If Li still stubbornly ignored them, Hankou would send a plane to take the group to Xi'an. However, the Thirty-second Group did not bring telecommunications equipment, so it lost contact with the Ninth Group on the 25th. The previous report was due to this. Also, as of yesterday, Li's representative had not yet arrived, and the Ninth Group is scheduled to fly to Xi'an tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The British Ambassador Can Only Arrive in Nanjing Today</h3>

<h3>People's Self-Defense Training Completed; Jinan's Defense is Solid and People are at Ease; However, the Economic Future is Extremely Precarious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 31st] Shandong's situation has prompted the National Army's strong self-defense due to the Communist army's repeated and widespread attacks. Coupled with the close cooperation of the party, government, and military, it was finally able to overcome the crisis of shock and waves. Although Jinan now hears the whistle of martial law declared every night, the people's hearts are calm, and there is no more panic. Compared to the previous month, when the Communist army launched a national attack, it was already a world apart. The city's people's self-defense training has been completed, further strengthening the people's confidence in ensuring local security. The preservation of coal mine areas and the fuel problem have been resolved, and the provincial capital, which has been dark for a long time, can shine brightly in recent days. Jinan has not heard any news of mediation for several days. The Seventh Executive Group is currently in Qingdao, and the date of the on-site survey along the Jiaoji Railway has not yet been determined. Jinan's foreign Communist army continues to invade, and the National Army is firmly defending its positions, without being invaded. However, Jinan has been besieged for a long time, the source of supplies has been cut off, and prices have soared, higher than the national average. Shops and factories are losing money and cannot support themselves, and the economy is in a state of exhausting the pond to catch fish, and the future is extremely precarious. The refugees fleeing from the Communist-controlled areas are still increasing. Although the local government has exhausted its efforts, it cannot solve the relief problem. Tragedies such as selling wives and children and suicides among the refugee population are often heard. They are all because their property has been confiscated and their lives have been cut off. If the central government does not provide rapid rescue, more serious consequences will definitely occur. According to the refugees, the Communist army's "struggle" policy in the "liberated areas" has indeed lost the hearts of the people.</p>
<h3>Sun Zhongyuan, Who Was Once Missing, Publishes a Letter to Li Zongren, Willing to Return to Sichuan Immediately to Continue Running a Business</h3>

Asked: When can he come back? Answer: "Mr. Sun is still going to see a doctor." The reporter asked what illness he had? He said it was a stomach problem. It is said that this place is not Sun Zhongyuan's home, but the residence of his friend. We asked what the friend's name was, and the gentleman said he didn't know. The reporter returned disappointed. Today, the World Daily published a letter from Sun Zhongyuan to Li Zongren, saying that he wanted to go home very much and hoped that Director Li would issue a passport to return to Sichuan. The original letter is as follows: "Director Li, I have been distressed after the illness, and because of the many family affairs, I was angry for a while and lived in a friend's house to recuperate. Newspapers have been reporting various rumors these days, which have almost caused political disputes. The guilt is very deep, so I would like to return to my hometown in the near future and continue to run my business. I will never engage in illegal activities. For my own safety, please find a way to protect me and ask you to issue a passport to return to Sichuan. Sincerely yours, Sun Zhongyuan, July 29"</p>

<p>Recently, small groups of communist bandits have been discovered frequently in the rural areas bordering Cheng, Xi, and Chang, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It is clear that the Northern Communist troops are fleeing into Jiangnan. In order to ensure the security of the territory and prevent traitors from hiding, the military police authorities of this county, together with the police and military police, conducted a surprise household check from 00:00 on the 30th. The entire city was under martial law at that time. In the area outside the South Gate, North Gate, and Guangfu Gate, many people were found to have inconsistent household registrations. After investigation, they were released on bail.</p>
<p>Anqing Hopeful Autumn Harvest, Stable Rice Prices</p>
<p>After rice prices in this port were once manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, along with the soaring gold prices, commodity prices rose in a straight line one after another. Recently, due to the new grain harvest and the hopeful autumn harvest, prices have gradually stabilized. Milled rice is 30,000 yuan per dan, medium grade is 29,000, and low grade is 27,500. Citizens are all beaming with joy.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Protecting Overseas Chinese Is an Urgent Priority</h3>
<p>At a time when the government has been slow to protest the Shibuya incident in Japan, where Japanese police shot and killed our Taiwanese compatriots, relations between Indonesia and overseas Chinese are becoming increasingly tense. Dismembered and beheaded bodies of overseas Chinese have been discovered in Medan, gruesome and shocking. Meanwhile, over a hundred thousand overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam are also caught in Vietnamese-French conflicts, and innocent people are suffering. The Vietnamese authorities frequently arrest overseas Chinese, arbitrarily confiscate banknotes, and prohibit the circulation of Eastern-Asian Bank notes. They also impose extra taxes on goods of Chinese merchants. All kinds of oppressive behaviors cause the overseas Chinese to suffer great losses. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, because of the war's impact, overseas Chinese have lost their fortunes, been displaced, and died in the thousands. Just as they thought that victory in the War of Resistance, the collapse of the powerful, and the rise of China's international status would allow them to resettle and live in peace, the overseas Chinese in Siam were immediately subjected to massacres; the bloodstains in the Dutch East Indies had not yet dried when the Shibuya incident in Japan occurred. In July, when the Philippines became independent, our special envoy Gan Naiguang went to the Philippines to attend the celebrations. Before a treaty and a commercial agreement could be concluded, the Philippine government suddenly promulgated retail and labor laws, imposing severe blows to the livelihood of overseas Chinese. After these incidents happened one after another, the killings and oppression in Indonesia and Vietnam are being repeated with increasing intensity.</p>
<p>The importance of overseas Chinese to the motherland is well known. In the past, they helped the revolution, compensated for foreign losses, and donated to the War of Resistance, not to mention. Even now, when China's imports from January to May have reached 200 billion yuan, and the national economy is seriously affected, overseas Chinese, despite struggling in the face of economic depression, continue to remit money back to the country. Their loyalty to the motherland is even more worthy of our admiration and gratitude. However, the motherland's government has not effectively met their minimum two requirements, the maintenance of life and the protection of property, which is somewhat irresponsible!</p>
<p>If we were to say that the Chinese government intentionally shirked its responsibility, that would of course not be true. The government has not failed to think about helping them and protecting them. But the government is suffering from two major root causes that have led to the tragic fate of overseas Chinese today: first, procrastination, and second, weakness. Whenever a massacre occurs, the government fails to take active action. All procedures are merely formalities, starting with investigation, then reporting, and finally considering. By the time a protest is lodged, the corpses have turned cold, the storm has passed, and the negotiations are nothing more than perfunctory. At most, they issue an apology, say "regret," and make a statement guaranteeing that the same incident will not happen again, which is considered good. However, the same incident is bound to continue to happen soon. Regarding the laws oppressing overseas Chinese, the government is also procrastinating and lethargic, even too lazy to lodge a protest, thinking that it is better not to protest than to protest in vain. This habit of procrastination is the same internally as it is externally. The decline in the efficiency of all administrative affairs of the government in recent years is due to this "drag" tactic! And our overseas Chinese have suffered greatly from our government's "procrastination" disease.</p>
<p>Weakness is an even more harmful root cause than procrastination! Procrastination may be forgivable under certain circumstances, but weakness is absolutely inexcusable. In the past, because the country was weak and surrounded by powerful neighbors, it could be said that a weak country has no diplomacy. Although China cannot now be truly considered a strong country, it is still one of the victorious nations, and at least nominally ranks among the five or six strong countries in the international community. We should no longer harbor any inferiority complex towards the victorious strong nations. But why are we still so cautious, tolerating humiliation, and afraid to speak a few harsh words to Siam, which aided the evildoers, France, whose Vichy government caused evil consequences, and the Vietnamese government in the colony, Japan, the criminal of all mankind, the Philippines, which has just gained independence, and the tyrannical Indonesia? A person has dignity, and a country has national dignity. If China continues like this, our national dignity will be disgraced by lightweight diplomats.</p>
<p>If it is said that the government's reach is limited and it cannot use force as a backup, so negotiations are difficult, that is not true either? When the massacre of overseas Chinese occurred in Siam, our troops in Vietnam could have stationed troops on the border as a backup. Instead, we acted humbly, moved our table to the other side, and sent envoys to negotiate. The Siamese government invited them to live in the palace, held grand banquets, and did their best to prevaricate. However, as soon as the envoys left the palace, the tragedy of the massacre was staged in the streets. Why does the government still have to give in? The French government in Vietnam only occupies a few important cities, and the Vietnamese government's power has only reached the whole of Vietnam. Why do the troops stationed in Vietnam only negotiate with the French government, only know to cooperate meekly with the French government, and not establish a detailed treaty with the Vietnamese government? Why did the government immediately and quickly withdraw its troops, leading to the current suffering of the overseas Chinese?</p>
<p>Procrastination and weakness are undoubtedly the biggest diseases of the Chinese government today and are the root cause of all internal and external problems. For example, in the issue of the Nationalists and Communists, after the victory, the government allowed the Communist army to occupy and invade, expand its troops on a large scale, and poison the people. Negotiations were delayed again and again, yielding again and again, until the situation became unmanageable today. It was still impossible not to make a decision to lift the threat to the capital. However, the lives and property of millions of citizens have been lost and have been plunged into deep water. Transportation is disrupted, cargo cannot be transported, industry and commerce are declining, and foreign goods are dumped, creating a phenomenon that the economy is about to collapse. And those who are fond of war and strife have their glib tongues and attribute all the responsibility to the government. Isn't this caused by procrastination and weakness? In the Spring and Autumn period, when Duke Zhuang of Zheng defeated Gongshu Duan, later commentators still said that Gongshu Duan certainly deserved his blame, but Duke Zhuang's indulgence of him beforehand could not escape the censure of the wise. Therefore, procrastination and weakness are by no means a proper solution.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese idiom: "Kind but not martial, nothing can be done." Today, the intention of the Chinese government is really too "kind," but all the insults are due to a lack of martial spirit. "Martial" does not necessarily mean using troops, but it means being firm and decisive, not fearing the strong, doing what should be done, never being perfunctory, and eradicating all habits of inertia, weakness, and listlessness. For example, punishing corruption, curbing violence, and levying taxes on wartime profiteers, these major events related to the national economy and the people's livelihood should all be decided promptly. However, the current government cannot demonstrate its martial virtue. Today, the central government has been entrusted by the 450 million people of the Chinese nation and is responsible for protecting the lives and property of 15 million overseas Chinese. It should strive to achieve something and wash away the past malpractices. We hope that the government will quickly come up with solutions to stabilize domestic order and protect overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Australian Representative Evatt Defends Small Nations at Peace Conference Yesterday; Drafting of Peace Treaty Should Be Based on Principles of Justice; Molotov Claims Potsdam Declaration Must Be Fulfilled</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): The second plenary session of the Peace Conference was held in Paris this afternoon. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech lasting 15 minutes, the main points of which were as follows: (1) All countries must uphold the prestige of the Council of Foreign Ministers and must not undermine its resolutions. (2) The Potsdam Declaration must be strictly fulfilled.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris, 31st (Radio): The head of the Australian delegation to the European Peace Conference, Evatt, delivered a speech today, stating that the five great powers should not forget the common victory won by the other sixteen countries after achieving victory. Australia is an example of these sixteen countries. In the same generation, we have twice crossed the ocean to campaign in Europe, making great sacrifices for the common victory. In six years, we fought simultaneously against Germany, Italy, and Japan in Europe, the Far East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, with battle zones spanning the globe. Evatt also said: We should not ignore the heroic resistance of the people of Greece, New Zealand, Africa, and Canada. Victory was achieved through the efforts of all Allied nations, so they should be given the same active right to participate in the common peace that belongs to all countries. He argued that the Paris Peace Conference should not be merely consultative in nature but should grant all countries genuine and effective participation rights. Therefore, the drafting of peace treaties should belong to all countries, not just three or four major powers. Evatt then cited the speech made by Berners on October 5, 1943, and Molotov's remarks at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to advocate for the interests of small countries. The Australian representative Evatt then analyzed the principles of drafting the peace treaty, saying that the great powers should not force their will on others based on a spirit of revenge. Our goal is the word "justice." Men, women, old, and young all over the world hope to obtain a peace that is fair to them and their children. If we impose an unjust and excessively humiliating burden on them, we will violate the spirit of democracy, and fascism may make a comeback.</p>
<h3>Heated Debate Erupts in Procedures Committee Over Voting Rights Issue; Soviet Union Insists on Two-Thirds Vote</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): The Procedures Committee of the Peace Conference continued its meeting at 10:00 a.m. today. Representatives engaged in a heated debate over the voting rights issue.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Molotov accused Australian representative Evatt of "playing some trickery with voting rights." Evatt spoke for a long time, emphasizing that peace is not a local European issue but a global issue, and that World War II was not only fought against Germany but also against Japan. The Netherlands and Australia made great efforts in the war against Japan, and there is no provision in the Potsdam and Moscow conference communiqués for a two-thirds majority vote. The Greek representative and the representatives of small countries were completely united in opposing the two-thirds method. Molotov did not elaborate and told the small countries, "Playing with voting rights may lead to a stalemate in the conference."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Molotov refuted the small countries' opposition to the control of the conference by the four powers, accusing the countries that supported a majority vote of using tricks to gain technical voting rights. He believed that this move would harm the Soviet bloc and benefit the Anglo-Saxon bloc. Molotov cited the argument of the French Socialist Party's newspaper "Popular" to support his argument, saying, "If a majority voting system is adopted, the Anglo-Saxon bloc can steadily obtain twelve or thirteen votes, while the Soviet Union will always be in the minority."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): After Molotov finished speaking, an American representative stood up and said that Berners would propose on August 1 that a two-thirds majority vote is required for the vote on major matters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 31st] The Slavic representative of the Procedures Committee requested that Albania be allowed to be the 22nd country to attend the Peace Conference, on the grounds that Albania was one of the first countries to be invaded by Italy and was ravaged by the invading country. The Dutch representative proposed that the host country France be the permanent chairman of the Peace Conference, rather than the four or five powers taking turns as chairman.</p>
<h3>Unagreed Clauses of Peace Treaty to Be Submitted to General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The various contentious clauses of the draft peace treaty that have not yet been agreed upon by the Council of Foreign Ministers were published here tonight and will be submitted to the 21-nation Peace Conference for discussion, including the proposals made by the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the rights of the United Nations in Italian property. The United States proposes that if property within Italy cannot be returned to the people of the United Nations who have suffered losses, Italy should fully compensate them. The Soviet Union proposes that Italy should be required to pay only one-third of the compensation because it was the first to leave the Axis powers. Britain and France have reserved their approval of the U.S. proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 31st] Some people here advocate that Marshal Badoglio be sent to Paris with the Italian delegation to attend the Peace Conference, so that this person who signed the Italian armistice agreement can confront the Allies, and the Allies will be able to understand their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Regarding Five-Nation Treaty; Only Nine Nations Will Be Allowed to Sign</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st (Radio): Of the 21 countries attending the Paris Peace Conference, only the nine countries that fought against the five defeated countries will be allowed to sign the five-nation treaty, and one of these countries will not sign any country's treaty. The nine countries are Britain, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Czechoslovakia. The United States has not fought against Finland, Canada has never declared war on Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece only declared war on the adjacent Axis countries, France, China, and the other five countries only declared war on Italy, and Dai has not declared war on any of the five countries.</p>
<h3>Black People from 48 States of America Surround the Presidential Palace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Black people from 48 states of America surrounded the White House today to protest the killing of two black couples in Georgia by white people.</p>
<h3>Bernays Solemnly Declares: America Will Never Revert to Isolation; Guarantees Respect for the Opinions of All Small Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The Paris Peace Conference convened at 4:00 PM today. First, U.S. Secretary of State Bernays spoke, followed by British Prime Minister Attlee, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie (the full text of his speech is in a separate cable), and others. Tomorrow's meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The first speaker will be Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who did not attend today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] U.S. Secretary of State Bernays delivered his first speech at the Peace Conference this afternoon, stating that those who have engaged in war must forge peace. The United States will abide by the agreements of the Council of Foreign Ministers, but if the representatives of the countries attending this conference present counter-proposals with a two-thirds majority vote, the United States will ensure that the conference considers those counter-proposals. Bernays reminded the audience that the Council of Foreign Ministers, when drafting the final peace treaty, not only allowed for the consideration of proposals made here, but also did not arbitrarily reject any suggestions. Bernays then discussed America's isolationist policy, stating that the United States had unwisely decided to revert to isolationism after the First World War, but now the United States has decided that no matter how difficult the path of international cooperation may be, it will never adopt the same policy again. This statement by Bernays was met with applause. He also opposed long-term, large-scale occupation of countries that have been effectively disarmed, as this is a method of guaranteeing peace, not achieving it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th, United Press] Bernays also declared that the United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, guarantees that it will fully consider the opinions of all small nations. British Prime Minister Attlee also stated that the conference is eager to hear the opinions of the seventeen small nations.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Miscellany</h3>
<p>[Hanguo News Agency, Paris, 31st] A wine stall has been set up at the entrance of the Luxembourg Palace, providing beer and liquor to journalists, and business is booming. Groups of reporters emerge from the conference venue to engage in spirited drinking and conversation at the stall. Whether this boisterous drinking is due to the rising temperature of the conference or the tediousness of the meetings remains for historians to decide.</p>
<p>Many delegates stroll through the floral gardens of the Luxembourg Palace, sipping champagne or exquisite cocktails amidst the colorful blooms, which is also a delightful pastime.</p>
<p>Bernays patronized a common eatery instead of entering the chic restaurants, reflecting his "eat-what-suits-me" approach. Bernays is very particular about his food and drink.</p>
<p>The speeches at the conference were unremarkable, but one lady's hat attracted considerable attention. This lady wore a black hat to the conference hall, adorned with two snow-white doves of peace, which was quite startling.</p>
<p>The conference venue has been meticulously arranged. Six firefighters are stationed on the roof of the Luxembourg Palace day and night to prevent any possible fire.</p>
<p>French veterans and wounded soldiers also joined in the commotion, demanding increased pensions, but so far, they have only managed to block the cars of the delegates attending the conference for a short time.</p>
<p>The cars of the chief delegates are marked with white flags, while the cars of other delegates are marked with red flags, making it easy to tell who is inside.</p>
<h3>British Liberal Party Newspaper Reports: Soviet Government to Reorganize, Molotov to Become Premier</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 30th] The British Liberal Party newspaper, "The Star," recently reported that Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Gusev, could become the next Foreign Minister. Knowledgeable sources are paying close attention to this in Paris, where he is attending the Peace Conference. It is reported that in January of this year, he represented the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly in London, explaining and defending the Soviet Union's views with considerable force, which earned him the trust of the Soviet government. With the death of a government official in the Soviet Union, coupled with Stalin's poor health, a cabinet reshuffle is inevitable. It is speculated that Foreign Minister Molotov will become the Premier, and Ambassador Gusev will succeed him as Foreign Minister. As for Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, he may withdraw from the diplomatic arena and be appointed as the head of departments related to the reconstruction of the Soviet economy.</p>
<h3>Situation Serious on the Bulgarian-Greek Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 31st] A New York Times reporter states: Greece has been attacked by Bulgaria three times in recent decades, so the Greeks are wary of Bulgaria. Bulgaria did not suffer much loss in this war. Recently, rumors have been circulating that Bulgaria has concentrated heavy troops along the Greek border, and that bandits armed with Bulgarian weapons are active in the Plovdiv area. Consequently, farmers in the Greek province of Thrace are quite anxious during this harvest season. There are widespread rumors that Bulgarian troops will invade Greece once British troops withdraw. They point out that Bulgarian troops are very familiar with the terrain there, and the narrowest point from the Bulgarian border to the coast is only twenty miles, so in the event of war, Bulgarian troops could cut off Greece's connection with the province of Thrace in an instant. Therefore, the situation on the Bulgarian-Greek border seems quite serious due to the state of psychological unrest.</p>
<h3>Rumor: United States and Siam Request Withdrawal of Complaint Against Vietnam</h3>
<p>To Avoid Impeding U.S.-French Understanding</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] According to reliable sources: The U.S. State Department today requested Siam to withdraw its complaint to the United Nations regarding the Siam-Vietnam border issue. Although the motivation for the request has not been officially disclosed, diplomatic circles in Washington believe that the United States needs France's support in Europe to oppose Soviet demands, and therefore, in the current stage of proceedings, it is eager to avoid participating in any disputes that could affect U.S.-French understanding.</p>
<h3>Soviet Prosecutor Also Argues: All German War Criminals Should Be Executed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 30th] Soviet prosecutor Rutunko today argued in court that all twenty-two German war criminals should be sentenced to death, stating that such a verdict would satisfy all of humanity. The various crimes with which the defendants have been charged have been fully proven, and they should now be sentenced to the ultimate penalty without exception.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Loan from the United States: Hope for Success Only by Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] Even if the Soviet Union seeks a loan from the United States that is only a fraction of the British loan, it is likely that it must wait until next year for any hope of success. It is reported that the Soviet government is quite interested in borrowing $1 billion from American businesses, but the United States notified Moscow months ago that if the Soviet Union agrees to simultaneously discuss trade relations with the Balkan countries and regions within the Soviet sphere of influence, then the United States would be willing to discuss this loan. Since then, nothing has been heard. Soviet loans must be processed through the Export-Import Bank, unlike British loans, which are paid directly by the Treasury. The Export-Import Bank is a government agency with reserves far below $1 billion. A formal request to increase the Export-Import Bank's fund has not been submitted. Congress is working hard to conclude various cases in preparation for adjournment, so it seems very difficult to take action this year. However, the Soviet Union occupies an important position in the discussions regarding the loan to Britain. Supporters of the loan argue that the $3.75 billion loan can make Britain a strong bulwark against the spread of communism.</p>
<h3>U.S. Rocket Test Breaks Altitude Record</h3>
<p>[United Press, White Sands, New Mexico, 30th] Army technicians today set a new record of 104 miles at this testing ground by launching another V-2 rocket invented by Germany (this is the ninth time). The previous record was 20.5 miles. This rocket, launched from here, landed 69 miles northeast, creating a deep hole in the New Mexico desert. The instruments installed in the rocket head were undamaged upon landing. Testers will be able to obtain records of cosmic ray heat and air pressure at the altitude reached by the rocket.</p>
<h3>United States and Britain Behind the Scenes Support Coup in Spain; Franco Likely to Be Forced to Step Down</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 30th] The News Chronicle recently reported that the United States and Britain, with the tacit approval of the Vatican, plan to support a coup in Spain in August or September of this year. Generals Aranda and Inglés are preparing everything in London and Washington. At that time, a provisional military government will be established. It is expected that Franco will be unable to offer any resistance and will quietly withdraw from politics. The provisional military government will also hold a referendum to decide on the issue of restoration, and then establish a formal government. Two-thirds of the members of the new cabinet have already been decided. Leaders of the Spanish Republican government have also expressed their support for this plan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress to Adjourn Soon; Three Bills Shelved</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Three bills proposed by the U.S. government, intended to strengthen U.S. control over world power politics and bolster U.S. defenses, will be delayed due to Congress's adjournment. Diplomatic authorities state that only one of the bills seems to have a slim chance of passing before Congress adjourns on August 2nd. The other two bills are hopeless. The following three bills have not been passed by either the Senate or the House of Representatives: (1) Authorizing President Truman to send military delegations to any location in the world. (2) Allowing President Truman to assist in training and equipping one million Chinese troops, but only if Special Envoy Marshall facilitates Chinese unity. (3) Allowing President Truman to raise the standards of troops and equipment throughout the Western Hemisphere to strengthen defense.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Decides to Accept Partition Plan for Palestine; U.S. and British Experts Propose U.S. Funds for Arabs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 31st Broadcast: The British House of Commons convened today and decided to accept the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee of Experts on the Palestine issue. Palestine will be divided into four regions: (1) the Jewish Province, (2) the Jerusalem District, (3) the Negev District, and (4) the Arab Province.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Authoritative sources: The report of the Anglo-American experts after discussing the Palestine issue in London has been submitted to President Truman, who has forwarded it to the Cabinet for review. It is reported that in addition to recommending the partition of Palestine, the report also suggests that the United States allocate $300 million for the Arab countries to develop their economies, with an additional $50 million specifically for the Arab people of Palestine.</p>
<h3>International Court of Justice to Hear the Issue of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 31st] The Far East International Tribunal today summoned Ryohei Kasagi, the former director of the puppet Manchukuo's Council of State, to testify about the establishment of Manchukuo. It is reported that before the Japanese army established the puppet regime of Manchukuo, it first organized the so-called Autonomous Guidance Department. Kasagi, in response to questions from defense attorney Ohara, insisted that the Japanese army organized the Guidance Department to maintain public order, as if the witness had been hired by the defendant. Subsequently, the chief prosecutor presented various documents and evidence related to Japan's invasion of Northeast China. Finally, Mrs. Liu Ai-lin, the prosecutor in charge of the Northeast China issue, presented various documents and evidence of Japan's control over Northeast China, including the "Outline of the Economic Organization Policy for Japan and Manchuria" decided by the Japanese Cabinet on March 31, 1934, which stated that Northeast China's transportation, communications, etc., related to Japan's national defense, should be placed under Japan's real power and properly controlled to accelerate its development. The financial system of Northeast China should also be properly organized to ensure the smooth operation of the financial organizations of Japan and Manchuria. Moreover, Japanese people should be sent to Northeast China as much as possible to provide the technology and labor needed for the development of Northeast China's industries.</p>
<p>Due to congested telecommunications today, a special article on the Palestine issue will be published later.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Paris Peace Conference; Emphasizes Two Principles for Creating Peace; Three Points to Note in Peace Treaty Terms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation, stated in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Paris Peace Conference this afternoon that China's policy was to emphasize two general principles for the work of creating peace, and three key points regarding the drafting of peace treaties with the former five European enemy countries. Recognizing the great importance of his speech, the Central News Agency reporter is sending the full text for domestic readers to consult. Wang stated: The convocation of this conference is indeed the first concrete step since the collapse of Germany and Japan for humanity to yearn for</p>
<p>Clearing Up the War</p>
<p>and restoring peace. Over the past few months, people around the world have been expecting a sign that would alleviate their worries about the future situation. However, their hopes have been repeatedly dimmed by doubts about whether the conference could be held. Today, the representatives of 21 countries are able to gather together to discuss peaceful solutions. This fact itself is enough to give the world great comfort, and the selection of Paris as the venue for the conference is also very satisfying. Paris, known throughout the world for its love of justice and freedom, will undoubtedly give all the attending representatives infinite inspiration, helping us to complete this important task. The French government has sincerely hosted and facilitated all the delegates, and I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation is participating in this conference with an ardent hope for its success. China participated in the Second World War for the longest time, and was the first to resist Axis aggression with arms, and also the last to end armed resistance. Although China did not directly participate in military operations on the European battlefield, we have fully fulfilled our responsibilities in this global war.</p>
<p>China's Resistance War</p>
<p>lasted eight years, and resulted in the loss of tens of millions of lives, which cannot be considered a small sacrifice. In view of the fact that peace is as indivisible as war, China cannot but be concerned about the work of the United Nations in truly establishing peace in any part of the world. There is no doubt that winning peace is no easier than winning war. We all know that proposing conditions and applying them to the defeated countries is one thing, while placing these conditions in a treaty and proving them to be feasible in the long run, so that peace can be sustained, is entirely another. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that it would be most gratifying if all suggestions and proposals, regardless of which delegation they are proposed by, can be accepted and receive the consideration they deserve based on their merits. Moreover, in the discussion of suggestions, we believe that there should be openness and honesty, and the subsequent publicity of these discussions will be very effective in promoting genuine understanding between all countries. Regarding</p>
<p>Peace Terms</p>
<p>I do not wish to comment at this time, but I would like to emphasize two points in particular, because from our perspective, these two points must be given extra attention if the next or subsequent peace conferences are to be successful. First, the victorious nations must abide by the promises they made during the war, as well as the principles they proclaimed. For example, when it comes to mediation and resolving territorial disputes, we must not forget the Atlantic Charter, nor should we limit its implementation. Second, the victorious nations should not propose conditions to the defeated countries that would allow reactionary elements in the defeated countries to make a comeback, thereby depriving democratic forces of any chance of rebirth or consolidation. Based on the above, I would like to briefly clarify the various treaty drafts submitted by the Chinese delegation for the consideration of the conference. First, regarding</p>
<p>Military Treaties</p>
<p>I believe that the drafts have given the United Nations appropriate security guarantees, while also ensuring that the defeated countries do not consider them to be unduly harsh. Moreover, in the case of Italy, its performance during the later stages of the war has already earned recognition. Second, as for the territorial, political, and economic clauses, I believe that the conference should conduct a more thorough discussion of the drafts, because the topics involved have a great impact on the future stability of Europe. Anyone who tries to read these treaty drafts cannot deny that many of the agreements reached are based on mutual compromise. If we can find ways to improve them, it will not be for the narrow interests of any party concerned, but for the broad and universal interests. Such agreements will and should be reached. Third, regarding the issue of Italian colonies, we must recognize that this issue has not yet been resolved. The Chinese delegation believes that the conference must accept certain</p>
<p>Fundamental Principles</p>
<p>as the guide for our search for a final solution. One of these principles should be that some or all of Italy's colonies should be granted independence immediately. If this is not feasible, they should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations for a certain period of time, during which preparations for their autonomy and independence should be completed. The impact of this policy will not only be limited to the people of the directly related territories, but will also give some hope and confidence to the millions of people elsewhere who are waiting for the early and full realization of their legitimate aspirations. We who participate in this conference may have differences of opinion, but the common people of all the countries we represent have a common desire, which is that this conference will achieve a genuine and lasting peace. They seem to have a common concern, which is that the governments participating in this conference have not yet been able to cooperate fully in this historically significant endeavor. Finally, I express my hope that the work of the conference will ultimately satisfy the universal aspirations of the common people, and eliminate their worries, so that the peace we create will be a peace for the common people, and not just a peace for government representatives, as some peace settlements have been in the past.</p>

<h3>The Accused He Dekui Continues to Work Diligently in Beijing and Shanghai; Supervising Commissioner Cheng Expresses Concern That This Harms Political Morality; Visited the Municipal Government Yesterday to Inquire for Half an Hour; Supervisory Yuan Decides to Continue Investigation and Handle According to Law</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of He Dekui, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, according to yesterday's newspaper reports of Mayor Wu's interview with reporters, he will await orders from the Executive Yuan. It is learned that Jiangsu Supervising Commissioner Cheng Zhongxing, and Supervisory Committee members Fan Zhengbo and Zhang Qingzhen, went to the Municipal Government together at 11:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire with Mayor Wu about the handling of the case and to review relevant case files. Cheng, Fan, and Zhang questioned He Dekui in the Mayor's office for half an hour, and the three left the Municipal Government at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Reporters inquired about the progress of the investigation at the entrance of the Municipal Government. The response was that the case was very simple, and its nature was a legal issue on one hand and an issue of political morality on the other. The legal aspect should be decided by the court according to the law. As for political morality, based on the evidence provided by Councilor Luo, the time when He Dekui signed the official document at the Municipal Council was June 1942. At that time, the full-scale war between China and Japan had been going on for five years, and the Chinese members of the Municipal Council's board of directors had all withdrawn. The chairman of the board had long been replaced by a Japanese person. He Dekui was a citizen of the Republic of China and should have known the great righteousness and responsibility of a citizen during his country's war against a foreign nation. The recent accusation has resulted in He Dekui diligently working in Beijing and Shanghai, and carrying on with business as usual. His remarks the other day have had a great impact on political morality and official conduct. The Supervisory Yuan will continue to investigate the case and handle it according to law.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhiben Talks About Cleaning Up the Takeover; Judging Good and Bad, Right and Wrong Based on Evidence; Expresses Determination to Do It Seriously</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Zhang Zhiben is the most notable figure in Shanghai today. He is the head of the takeover work investigation team. His target is specifically the high-ranking officials who have handled the takeover work since the victory, and the various agencies represented by those high-ranking officials. He wants to investigate how the astronomical number of enemy and puppet properties were taken over, and how they were disposed of. He will accept complaints from anyone in Shanghai and redress their grievances. From these few points, you can see how arduous his task is.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, this reporter met the 66-year-old elder in Lane 17, Fuxing Middle Road. His silver hair and wrinkled face clearly show how difficult and intractable his work has been over the decades. He has long recognized that this new job requires even more patience and dedication than the Administrative Court. He bravely told reporters: "Since I have taken on this responsibility, I must do it seriously." At the same time, he also explained: "The current supervisory system is completely different from the imperial censor system of the past. We must judge 'good' and 'bad,' 'right' and 'wrong' based on solid evidence. Before understanding the truth, we must never make sweeping criticisms. Everything we do must be in accordance with the 'law.'" The "law" seems to be an inseparable term from him. Director Zhang is a senior figure in the judicial community. In the early years of the Republic of China, he served as the Minister of Justice. In 1927, he served as the Chairman of Hubei Province. The government has always relied on him. During the War of Resistance, he served as the Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan and the President of the Administrative Court for eight years. The Administrative Court is not an ordinary court. It specifically accepts complaints from ordinary people who are dissatisfied with the actions of government agencies. Mr. Zhang has been doing supervisory work for decades. The general public may still be unfamiliar with him, but few officials in the Republic of China do not know him. Having him lead the investigation in Shanghai, the most complex and convoluted takeover area, is considered by us to be the most ideal choice.</p>
<p>Deadline for Reporting Takeover Situation</p>
<p>The first group of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Takeover Handling Work Investigation Team has now received more than fifty confidential letters of accusation, and many cases have been filed in person. The investigation is underway. However, the group hopes that in-person accusations will be limited to illiterate accusers. All others should report in writing to save time. In addition, a total of 90 takeover agencies in the city have been given a deadline of ten days to submit reports for review. Except for seven agencies that have applied for exemption from submitting reports due to the abolition of their organizations, the remaining 80-plus agencies are rushing to prepare their reports. The group is scheduled to convene a meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM to hear reports from the city's various trade associations.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper]: Regarding the case of Xue Jianqiu's abduction, after plainclothes policeman Zhou of the Huangpu Branch Bureau reported to the authorities that Xue was suspected of being a traitor, yesterday Zhang Changyun, residing at No. 19, Xiande Li, Tibet Middle Road, submitted a complaint to the police accusing Xue Jianqiu (i.e., Xue Yongming), stating that in September of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), Xue served as an interpreter for Sergeant Ando of the enemy's Mei Agency. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he opened the Yongming Company in Heng Street, Zhuji, and plundered tung oil, castor oil, copper plates, timber, and other resources to supply the enemy. Subsequently, Ando was transferred, and Ikeda succeeded him, but Xue remained willing to curry favor with the enemy. In June of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he again plundered more than 100,000 fir logs and rafted them into rafts under the Fubridge in Zhuji, attempting to transport them to Hangzhou to supply the enemy. However, at that time, the river suddenly rose greatly, sweeping away all the large rafts. Afterwards, Xue reported to the enemy Gendarmerie and dispatched dozens of enemy soldiers to search. Subsequently, in Qingshuitan and Wanpu'er, they discovered that local farmers were building houses, and Xue accused them of stealing timber. In addition to burning down the residences in those two locations, he also extorted tens of thousands of yuan from the local citizens before leaving.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Ullambana Festival Greatly Affects Monks and Taoists</h3>

<h3>Proprietor of Gaoqiao Tin Shop Steals Large Quantity of Supplies</h3>
<p>Late at night on July 28th, the Gaoqiao police station received a report that Tao Chunsheng, proprietor of the Yusheng Copper and Tin Shop on North Street, had stolen a large quantity of supplies after the surrender of the enemy and puppet regime, and buried them in an empty lot opposite the shop. Director Zhou of the Zhou Branch dispatched officers to investigate the address after receiving the report. Upon arriving at the location, Tao Fudao, the shop's owner, was leading three apprentices in digging out multiple pieces of machinery and a large quantity of supplies such as rubber hoses, rubber belts (used for motors), copper wire, and electrical wiring. The value was estimated to be in the tens of millions of yuan. Section Chief Cao took Tao and the other three men and the stolen goods back to the station for questioning. It was learned that the supplies belonged to the Shanghai Oil Refinery. The refinery sent personnel to confirm this. The case involves theft and has been transferred to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The main suspect, Tao Chunsheng, colluded with a gang of local ruffians after the surrender of the enemy and puppet regime to steal electrical wiring and supplies from oil factories in the Gaoqiao area, selling them for profit. He lived a wealthy life, residing on the upper floor of the Wanyuan Copper and Tin Shop on Nichengqiao, Shanghai, with a prostitute.

<h3>Electrical Wire Theft Cracked</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper]: Electrical and communication lines in the jurisdiction of the Xinshijie Police Branch in this city have been stolen from time to time. Recently, they were stolen three times in a row within one month, damaging 260 yards of electrical wiring. The branch director of the bureau, Ni Huanan, sternly ordered his subordinates to investigate and apprehend the perpetrators. He personally patrolled and supervised every night. Plainclothes officers from the judicial section also departed on patrol shifts. At 3:00 a.m. on July 26th, they saw a figure moving near the railway tracks in the darkness. Police Sergeant Shi Renyang and police officer Shao Bingwen, who were lying in wait there, discovered the suspect first. They shouted a command to stop, but they heard the sound and fled. The police whistle sounded, and the officers patrolling nearby rushed to apprehend them. In the darkness, they arrested a thief named Zhou Amao and seized stolen goods consisting of a bundle of thin copper wire and ten sections of lead-sheathed electrical wire. They took them back to the station for questioning, and Zhou confessed to accomplices Liang Along, Liang Caiyang, and Lu Aizhen. Section member Yuan Haiping led the police to arrest them at their addresses and found that Zhenda Copper and Tin Shop and Yuanda Copper and Tin Shop were suspected of receiving stolen goods.

<h3>Revenue from Manure Reaches 10 Million Daily; Health Bureau Decides to Continue Contract System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper]: The disposal of manure in this city was previously contracted to the so-called "Manure Kings." After the victory, the contract system was abolished, and the cleaning department of the Health Bureau handled it themselves. The price obtained from sales varies daily. According to recent statistics, the municipal government's average daily income is approximately 10 million yuan, but it is inevitable that there is a large amount of leakage. In order to improve the situation and seek uniform revenue, the Health Bureau plans to re-adopt the contract system and is currently receiving bids from the former "Manure Kings." The detailed implementation measures are being discussed by Zhang Weizheng, Director of the Health Bureau, and Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Family Scene: Grain Merchant's Son and Two Grandsons Commit Suicide by Poison; Wife Attempts Suicide after Failure to Take a Concubine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper]: No. 1, Qunxian Villa, Lane 225, Jinshenni Road, is the residence of Wang Bingkun (49 years old, from Ningbo), a grain merchant in this city. His wife, Gu (44 years old), and daughter, Yuzhen (18 years old), live with him.

<h3>City Government Streamlines Organization and Staffing, Saving One-Third of Expenses</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The draft of the city government's organizational regulations is based on the Municipal Organization Law of the Legislative Yuan. The full text of the draft, consisting of more than forty articles, was approved by the municipal government meeting on July 26 and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. After review by the Executive Yuan and then by the Legislative Yuan, it can be finalized and is expected to be implemented around mid-September. According to the draft, in addition to the eight bureaus remaining as before but with reduced scope, the existing nine offices will be reduced to six. The order is as follows: Secretariat, Civil Affairs Office, Police Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Education Bureau, Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, Health Bureau, Accounting Office, Statistics Office, Personnel Office, and Press Office.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>This Year's District Production - Internal Regulations for Matters to be Handled</h3>
<p>The organizational regulations of the Municipal District Production Committee, consisting of thirteen articles, were drafted and promulgated by the Municipal Government in March of this year, based on Article 5 of the Municipal Organization Law.  Yesterday, a public letter was received from the Ministry of Interior stating: "Investigations have revealed that since 1943, the rear provinces have all followed the 'Township Production Method' and other relevant laws to successively organize township production and have obtained considerable benefits. Since the revised Municipal Organization Law was promulgated, the original method is no longer fully applicable to the municipality. The Ministry has re-drafted the 'Municipal Production Method' and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which was promulgated and implemented by a clear order on December 15, 1945, and a partial letter was sent to your Municipal Government for reference. Now, with the victory of restoration, it should be continued to be promoted extensively.  According to the Ministry's 1946 work plan, you should immediately urge the districts to handle the following items:</p>
<p>(1) For counties that have implemented township production, the organization of the Township Production Committee under their jurisdiction should be thoroughly investigated to see if it is sound. If there are inappropriate candidates or dereliction of duty, they should be ordered to reorganize according to the law. (2) Counties or townships that have not implemented township production should be urged to implement them universally. (3) Each county should, in accordance with current laws and regulations and actual circumstances, formulate specific measures for raising the land, funds, labor, etc. required for production this year, and order them to be followed. (4) Each county should stipulate the implementation progress and completion deadlines for various production tasks, order them to be implemented in accordance with the prepared production plan, and compile the production situation of each township according to the plan briefing form promulgated by the Ministry, and forward it to the relevant ministries and the Ministry for verification. (5) Each province in the recovered area should immediately draft the organizational regulations of the Township Production Committee and the detailed rules for the implementation of the Township Production Method in accordance with the provisions of the Township Production Method, and report them to the Ministry and relevant ministries for verification and filing. (6) Each municipal government should quickly draft the organizational regulations of the Municipal District Production Committee and the detailed rules for the implementation of the Municipal Production Method in accordance with the Municipal Production Method and the Ministry's previous letter, and report them to the Ministry for verification and filing." The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department is now urging the districts to handle them diligently.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment for Dependents of Soldiers - Taken Over by the Civil Affairs Department</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Personnel Department originally handled the business of preferential treatment for the families of soldiers who went to war against the enemy in this city. It was resolved at the 40th Municipal Government Meeting last week to be presided over by the Civil Affairs Department. Now, the files of the item have been transferred from the Personnel Department to the Civil Affairs Department. It is also learned that the Provisional Measures for Preferential Treatment of Families of Soldiers Who Went to War Against the Enemy in this city have also been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government Meeting for revision and approval.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Employing Chinese - No Need to Issue Household Permits</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Issues Clear Explanation</p>
<p>The Tenth District (Jing'an) is a residential area in this city, and many foreigners reside in this area. Since this household registration was sorted out, some rations or relief supplies have been issued based on the national identity card or household permit. However, there is no clear regulation as to whether Chinese people and employees residing in foreign households should be issued household permits. The household registration section of the district has specially submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government for explanation. The Civil Affairs Department has replied by letter, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) Chinese people in foreign households who have another residence should be issued household permits by the district office where the residence is located. If there is no other residence and they are employed in a foreign household, there is no need to issue another household permit. (2) For changes in household registration after the household census, the Bao chiefs should be seriously ordered to investigate and fill in the household permits at any time. For households that move in as a whole household, household permits should be issued at the time of application for registration, and the district office should verify the facts and reissue them. The district is now acting accordingly.</p>
<h3>Tenth District Opens Bao Chief Meeting</h3>
<p>The Tenth District (Jing'an District) District Office held its first district-wide Bao Chief meeting at 3:00 PM on July 30th at the Ballroom on the second floor of the Paramount Ballroom on Yuyuan Road. Jin Dehuan, the District Chief of the district, and more than forty Bao Chiefs attended.

Regarding other proposals, each Bao Chief expressed opinions and listed them as specific measures, which adjourned until after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Eighteenth District's Re-inspection Completed</h3>
<p>Since the Eighteenth District Office began the re-inspection of household registration, the work has been extremely tense, and even more so because the enemy aliens in the territory have been sent back to their country, and each household has moved in. Ordinary civilians have also built sheds on vacant land to live in, and there are many declarations of moving in, which must be clearly investigated. Now the re-inspection work has been completed, and household statistics are being rushed to be submitted to the Municipal Government soon. In addition, the national identity cards of the district have also been fully issued.</p>
<h3>Twentieth District Requests Establishment of Postal Branch</h3>
<p>The Twentieth District (Yangshupu), because the district is located in eastern Shanghai and belongs to the factory area, the number of residents has been increasing day by day as various factories have resumed operations one after another. The number of letters to and fro is increasing day by day. Although ordinary letters can be dropped into mailboxes everywhere, express and registered mail must be delivered to the Tilanqiao Post Office, which is far away. The round-trip fare exceeds the postage by several times, and the time lost cannot be estimated. In order to specially request the Municipal Government to transfer the letter to the Postal Administration General Bureau, it is approved to set up a postal branch or agency in the center of the district to benefit the citizens.</p>

Although it was tightened repeatedly after liquidation, the manpower was still inevitably complex. There was a strike by all employees ten days ago, which was quickly quelled. Some employees were concerned that the inventory liquidation would be completed, and they were deeply afraid that their jobs would be in trouble, so they have not been stable. Some factories also hope that they can continue to supply the goods due to the familiarity of the goods. However, the authority of the liquidation office is limited to ending the current business and cannot import goods for the market. The seller and the user both pressed Mr. Cheng to find a way to maintain it in order to achieve a win-win situation. According to the news revealed by the factory industry association, the good quality of De Fu's Liang materials and Yan materials is indeed a fact, but after all, they are enemy properties, so they will inevitably be sold out. As for whether the government should ship goods from Germany to compensate for the war reparations and use them to transfer to industrial use, it is a question of decision and politics that must be seriously considered. Therefore, although some factories requested the association to submit a request to the government, the association has not done so. Recently, the Indanthrene market has risen sharply, and the main reason is this. According to the situation in January and February, the De Fu inventory seems to be running out. According to people in the Yan material industry, assorted goods will rise in price due to shortages in the future. As for the goods on the road, there are American and British goods to supply, so there is no need to panic. The inland dye shops that have always used De Fu brands will feel great difficulty. It is found that there are no less than hundreds of kinds of products of De Fu, which are exclusively sold by Yan material firms under the brand name. The large Yan material firms in this city rely on this for a living. Those who change to their own brand to supply the local customers will be greatly affected in the future. As for Indanthrene, there were originally several kinds of colors, and blue is the most famous one. There are Bao Lin of the American Hengxin Foreign Firm and Clidaton of the British Bu Neimen Foreign Firm to compete with it. If British and American goods are supplied, the dye factories will not be greatly affected, otherwise, they will sit and wait for the dumping of foreign colored cloth, which will increase the industrial crisis again.</p>
<h3>Guang Merchants Cover Short Positions - Gold Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>US Dollar Rises, Government Bonds Stable</p>
<p>Although crude gold showed fatigue yesterday, it was extremely stable because there were people covering short positions. The morning opened flat, and after opening, there were Guang merchants who had sold short last week covering their positions at maturity, rising to about 1.875 million. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 40 gold bars at a price of 1.87 million for registration. After that, it gradually turned flat, and the low price fell to 1.86 million. At noon, it struggled around 1.865 million. It was slightly stable in the afternoon. The last transaction for the next day was around 1.875 million. As a result, it closed up 10,000 compared with the previous day. Jewelry and silver were flat, silver dollars fell slightly, and the interest rate was slightly higher due to the end of the month, ranging from one jiao to one and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were calm and unchanged. There were people buying and selling, gradually rising from around 2,470 yuan to 2,500 yuan. There were still few transactions, and it struggled around 2,490 yuan at noon. It continued to rise slightly in the afternoon, and finally settled at 2,500 yuan.

The result was still flat, with Hong Kong exchange rate around 550 yuan, Indian exchange rate around 665 yuan, and British exchange rate between 8,800 and 8,900, all slightly relaxed, and the US exchange rate did not change much.</p>
<p>Government bonds were stable, and market prices were slightly higher. Tong Bing opened at 690 yuan in the morning. This price was immediately supported by a small amount of speculative capital, and gradually rose to a high price of 750 yuan, and turned around near noon. As a result, it recovered and rose by 50 yuan compared with the previous closing. Other bonds all rose by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Phases of Sugar Allocation - 74,000 for the Seventh Phase - Retail Price 860 Yuan - 70,000 for the Eighth Phase - Retail Price 820 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the chairman of the Southern Goods Industry Association, Ru Pin, the city's flat-price sales of sugar have been negotiated with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Southern Goods and Tea Food Industry. 352 peers in the city will universally sell it tomorrow. This is the seventh phase of the Taiwan Company's allocation of 74,000 yuan per dan, and the retail price is set at 860 yuan per jin. There is no limit to the amount each person can buy. The company's eighth phase of sugar sales is still decided by the Social Affairs Bureau, and is allocated to various southern goods stores and other retailers.

The selling price of the city's grain is not allowed to exceed 77,000 yuan per dan. The retail price must not exceed 820 yuan per jin.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Market is Chaotic - Yong Yarn and Meyer Diverge</h3>
<p>The Hua stock market is extremely chaotic. Many large investors are actively shorting Meyer and longing Yong Yarn. The two are diverging. The three small stocks are relatively stable, not as volatile as the two major hot stocks. Yong Yarn first saw a low price of 655 yuan, and then rose to 710 yuan, and finally hovered around the 700 yuan mark. Meyer first mailed a high price of 4,200 yuan, and then fell to below 3,700 yuan. Before closing, it rebounded to above 4,000 yuan. Jingfu rose from a low price of 240 yuan to 265 yuan. Xinguang rose from 235 yuan to 255 yuan. Qinxing rose from 178 yuan to 198 yuan. At noon, they all hovered. The unpopular stocks were still relatively stable. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the rubber band calculated that Yong Yarn rose by half a percent, and Meyer fell slightly. The three small hot stocks rose by half a percent. The relatively unpopular small and medium-sized stocks rose slightly and stably. The world book was erratic due to the erratic supply and demand. Yesterday, it suddenly fell a lot. The veteran stocks were stable and unchanged.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still difficult to develop. The supply and demand of each stock was different, and the rise and fall were small. Yi Yarn opened at 8,900 yuan, and fell slightly to 8,600 yuan. The rest of the stock market was slightly volatile and fluctuated only. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yinglian, Yiguang, and Pingping were calculated. Yi Yarn, Yi Beer, Huideying, and Asian Steel Industry all fell slightly. The paper industry was slightly outside, and the market did not change much.</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks Still Need to Ask for Instructions - Silver and Money Preparation Association Not Established - More Than 160 Participants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It was previously reported that the Silver and Money Industry Joint Preparation Association would be formally established today. Now, the reporter visited the association's preparatory office, and learned that the preparatory office had sent out circulars to 175 exchange firms and trust companies listed in the Shanghai Clearing House roster, inviting them to join. Yesterday was the deadline. Except for a few foreign banks, which had not yet participated because they still needed to ask for instructions from their home office, more than 160 had participated. It is expected that the inaugural meeting will be convened within a few days to decide on the future development of the association's business, so the news that it will be established today is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Intend to Issue Treasury Bills - As Circulating Chips</h3>
<p>It is also reported that after the establishment of the association, it will issue treasury bills as a circulating tool for members. Each member can use securities, government bonds, real estate, and warehouse receipts for goods, etc., to pay as a reserve at a 70% discount on the assessed amount, and the association will issue treasury bills. Each member can borrow from other firms with a full discount on the treasury bills received. The person in charge of the association also said that the establishment of the association will have a great effect on stabilizing Shanghai's finances. If any member encounters a sharp turnaround, no unexpected situation will occur.</p>
<h3>Oil Price Returns to Flat - Oil Factories Continue to Supply - Allocated Price Still as Before</h3>
<p>The market price of edible oil in this city has been rising recently. The municipal government is trying to suppress it. Yesterday, trading was restored. The China Vegetable Oil Factory has been allocating 200 barrels per day since the 24th of this month, and it is still continuing to allocate them. It is reported that the daily consumption of edible oil is about 1,500 dan. The 200 barrels allocated by the China Vegetable Oil Factory are about 700 dan, which already accounts for half of the suspension. Although the sources of edible oil in northern Jiangsu and Qingdao are scarce, the inventory is very abundant, so there is not much shortage. The recent surge in market prices was actually manipulated by someone. After being released, it was cancelled and collected in the market, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and the market price was raised. After a thorough investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau's staff, they consulted with the China Vegetable Oil Factory to do their best to maintain the supply as usual. The 200 barrels allocated daily are still at the price of last Friday (26th), which is 68,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cloth Still Have No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was as sluggish as before. Large-scale yarns such as Ji Ma's price did not fall again, but small and medium-sized yarns still could not stand firm, resulting in another drop of about 20,000. People's hearts were still weak, and there was still no improvement in transactions. At noon, the Spinning and Construction Department opened yarn as usual, but the number of purchasers was far less than before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegrams all fell by 30 to 44 pounds. It is estimated that the recent American gold is 31.74, the new cotton futures is 28.83, and the Midlin spot is 32.48. The local transactions were normal. Only Hongjun and Datong two yarn factories purchased slightly. The market price was slightly flat due to the frequent fall of American cotton.</p>
<p>The cloth market had very few transactions, and people's hearts were scattered. Because the foreign market was depressed, the guest houses did not handle it, and the market prices of each store fell by 250 yuan to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Datong Commercial Bank - Shareholders Meeting Held Yesterday - Expanding Capital and Re-electing Supervisors</h3>
<p>Datong Commercial Bank in this city was established in 1930. The head office was originally located in Chongming, and a branch was set up in Shanghai. In 1939, it was approved by the Ministry of Economy to set up the head office in Shanghai Beijing Road No. 280. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the shareholders' meeting was held in the bank to adjust the capital to 30 million national currency, amend the articles of association, and elect Lu Caifu, Yu Jinting, Luo Qinghua, Sun Ruihuang, Ma Shaomu, Zhong Xiasheng, Shi Danfu, Shen Jinfu, and Ma Juying as nine directors, and Song Cunxin, Wang Yuqiao, and Pan Lianfa as three supervisors.</p>

<h3>Food Sources Keep Arriving - Grain Review Committee Further Reduces Negotiated Price - Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Generally Weak</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau's Food Review Committee held its twelfth flat-price review meeting yesterday. Attended by Ji Chaozhai, head of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Yin Fuxiang, Cai Shengming, Zhang Xihu, Qu Zhenhua, Yang Jiuzi, and Qian Xingzhong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Because the sources of rice are constantly arriving. Therefore, the review price was determined to be 62,000 yuan for white japonica, which is 2,000 less than before, 67,500 yuan for door sales, 60,000 yuan for sheep indica, which is 3,000 less, 65,500 yuan for door sales, 53,000 yuan for port indica, which is 3,000 less, 58,000 yuan for door sales, 48,000 yuan for Qu indica, which is 3,000 less, 52,500 yuan for door sales, and 43,000 yuan for white indica. It is 3,000 yuan less, and the door sales are 47,000 yuan, all of which have fallen compared to before. In a blink of an eye, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and there is a possibility of further decline. 70,000 bags of Yue rice (every 100 bags equals 150 shi) can arrive in Shanghai today and be sold to the allocated rice shops. The investigation of qualified people has increased by 200 yesterday. The total is 1,100. The amount of brown rice previously allocated was more than 15,000. As of today, only about one-third has been sold by the rice shop owners. For the welfare of the colleagues of the company's factories, the Social Affairs Bureau can apply to the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau for allocation by the number of people in each company factory. Yesterday, a total of more than 8,000 shi arrived in the north and south markets, and the market sales were still sluggish. White japonica continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, white yuan was still less magical, and it also fell by about 1,000 yuan. Pudong new japonica continued to see 20 to 30 shi. Rice products are still early in color, and it also fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Flour has increased dramatically, with whole family and warship flour arrivals, and it has suddenly softened, stopping the rise and turning to fall, falling by 400 to 500 yuan. The guest gang of wheat Yong Min two gangs entered the stomach poorly, the market situation was flat, the medium and secondary rebounded and became weak, showing a slight reduction, and the skin also fell by 100 to 200 yuan. The arrival of soybeans was indifferent, and the removal and transformation were active and prosperous, forming two enemies. The digestion in the foreign ports was extremely small, and the oil factory's acceptance was not greedy. The retail in this street was slightly taken, and the opening remained in the bureau. There were slightly fewer broad beans and finished goods. After the sharp drop in the middle and lower grades, there were inquiries, and it turned from tired to hard, and the high goods still tended to be flat.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Clouds and Mist of Lushan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, dispatched by this newspaper from Kuling Airmail</p>
<p>One reason the Chairman likes Lushan is because "the mountains have water." It is said he once remarked: "Emei Mountain is beautiful but lacks water, causing people to avoid seeking summer refuge there. Lushan is superior because it has both mountains and water." The Chairman loves water, especially the "quiet sound of flowing water" to aid his thoughts.</p>
<p>The sedan chairs of the Chairman and his wife are slightly different from the others. The sedan roof is made of black lacquer cloth, the sides are blue cloth, and the sedan poles are one-third longer than usual, painted black. The wood is strong, fine, and durable, originating from the Xikou area of Zhejiang. Each tree can only yield one suitable pole. It is said that sitting on them is as smooth as riding in a car, and even the sedan bearers changing shoulders is hardly noticeable. This is mostly due to the skilled sedan bearers, who have had over ten years of experience carrying the Chairman's sedan, from Lushan to Chongqing and back again. There are a total of twelve sedan bearers regularly, six for each shift, all wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and white grass hats.</p>
<p>Two sedan chairs specially made for Marshal Ma and his wife are currently being processed in Jiujiang and will be completed and ready for use soon. It is said that each chair costs 470,000 yuan, and they are not even the best quality.</p>
<p>Kuling's cafes, despite having three establishments: "Carlton," "Yuan Ming Yuan," and "Green Quality," are lacking. The coffee at the first is like "burnt rice water," the second is like "brown sugar water," and the third is like "scorched rice soup." But with each cup costing only 400 yuan, one cannot be too critical.</p>
<p>Fruits are both expensive and scarce. Fruits posing as "raw open-shi" cost 900 yuan each, small green apples cost 2,400 yuan per catty. Watermelons are more plentiful and cheaper, but large and not sweet. Overripe loquats are ignored, causing Old Guan to frown.</p>
<p>There's only one proper shop. One has a wireless radio, and three have phonographs, with almost all records being Peking Opera. The "newest" song is "Miss Zhilan."</p>
<p>Chewing gum is sold in three places, but few people pay attention to it, so the price "can't go up" (liclets) at 300 yuan per box (containing two pieces).</p>
<p>Among cigarettes, "Philip Morris" is popular, with the morning wind and also resembling early summer, while the evening resembles early autumn.</p>
<p>No fewer than twenty reporters from various places have added a lot of vitality to Lushan, but the telegraph office is overwhelmed. Evening newspapers call in the morning, and daily newspapers call in the evening, and only after 1 or 2 AM does it quiet down slightly. In addition, phone calls to and from various agencies are also incessant.</p>
<p>There are only forty-eight foreigners on the mountain. The "extravagance" is incomparable to previous years. One foreigner wanted to buy a five-pound can of "Golden Gate" milk powder, priced at 26,000 yuan, but after bargaining down to 20,000 yuan, the deal fell through.</p>
<p>They then came to an agreement five minutes later for the same price, because he realized 26,000 was the lowest price in town.</p>
<p>There are three decent photo studios, "Yangtze," "Honghua," and "Luzhen," but business is not booming. They only sell existing stock of scenic photos, but are quite busy developing and printing for customers, the results of the newly arrived reporters' "nerve war." Although the prices are high, 1,000 yuan for developing and 400 yuan for a four-inch print, it is impossible not to have them developed.</p>
<p>The mountain weather is like three seasons in one day: the morning is like early spring, the middle</p>
<p>Cheap, at 9,500 yuan per carton.</p>
<p>Streetlights are like phosphorescent fire, with several places in the dark. Pedestrians must carry walking sticks and flashlights at night.</p>
<p>The residents on the mountain have this habit: their manners are slow, their movements are sluggish, and whenever asked a question, they go around in circles, unable to resolve it for half a day. It is unknown whether this is due to the influence of the clouds and mist.</p>
<p>The trend of entertaining reporters has gradually increased. The first time was an invitation by the Administration Bureau on the afternoon of July 21st, with refreshments served to guests, and hosts and guests were all happy.</p>
<p>Most reporters stay at the Hu Jinfang Hotel and have set up their own club, due to everyone being overly tense all day, with official business outweighing entertainment.</p>
<p>The "Summer Voice" drama troupe, responding to an invitation from the Summer Camp, has over seventy members. On the 26th, they arrived in Lushan from Hankou, each child carrying a can of relief organization's milk powder on their waist, walking up the mountain. The total cost for this trip is ten million yuan, reportedly with the Jiangxi Province Chairman Wang Lingji bearing five million and the Summer Camp providing five million. However, the treatment of the troupe members is lacking, with children sleeping on the floor and meals consisting of only one dish.</p>
<p>The Livelihood Society has taken over thirty-two houses here, so all foreign guests who come to the mountain are handled and entertained by the Society.</p>
<p>The Livelihood Society provides movies for some to watch. The Summer Camp shows them about twice, Marshal Ma's residence shows them two or three times, and the church also has two showings a week. This is the only movie entertainment on the mountain, but unfortunately the equipment is not very good and the electricity is insufficient, so watching for one hour requires waiting for one hour, which is very tiring.</p>
<p>Latest news: Marshal Ma's wife greatly admires Chinese-style qipaos and would like to have a few made to wear. Therefore, Madame Chiang has specifically ordered her own tailor to go and make them for Marshal Ma's wife.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Official Residence in Lushan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xie Baozhu, dispatched by this newspaper from Kuling Airmail</p>
<p>Not far after walking through Kuling Street, you can see a colorful oil painting of the Chairman, over ten feet high and eight feet wide, standing in front of a green grove. The mercury lamp in front of the portrait, because the position was not suitable, has already been changed from an oblique angle to vertical, and is being modified for the third time on the opposite telephone pole. Unfortunately, the power of the Magic Mountain is insufficient, and the light emitted from the four light bulbs still has a yellow hue. To the left of the Chairman's portrait is Hedong Road, where the official residence is located. If you walk forward and approach Mansion No. 12, you can find another oil painting of Madame Chiang, which is smaller than the Chairman's portrait. In front of the official residence, there is a small bridge with green railings and a blue bridge deck leading to the opposite Hexi Road, which is Marshal Marshall's residence. Similarly, on Hexi Road, there is also an image of Marshal Ma, all of which are painted with a vivid spirit, making people feel solemn and respectful. A clear stream separates the east and west roads, with the gurgling water bringing a constant rhythm of sound to the silence.</p>
<p>The design of the Chairman's official residence is very special, resembling a row of low stone bridges in a wave pattern. However, because they are too low, they are now preparing to plant cypress trees around them. To the right of the entrance is the garden. Before the War of Resistance, when Madame Chiang came to Lushan for summer, she often played golf in this garden, accompanied by Mr. Donner. It is said that the garden was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation. Not only were there no flowers left, but even the turf was scraped off. Madame Chiang loves flowers and trees, so after coming to the mountain this time, she has been personally supervising the gardeners to rearrange the garden every day, and has also studied the planting of flowers and plants with Marshal Marshall. To the left of the gate, passing through a climbing frame and up the stone steps, you can reach the veranda on the first floor of the residence, which faces the garden. On the veranda are milky-white chairs and a rattan table, with potted flowers around the semi-circle. Sometimes, when the weather is sunny and slightly hot, the Chairman and his wife entertain guests on the veranda.</p>
<p>Downstairs, there is a large living room, dining room, lounge, and office, each with very simple and tidy interior arrangements. The furniture is milky-white, the vermilion window frames are fitted with screens, and the curtains are made of light yellow fabric. The sofa covers are all in horizontal stripes of light green and milky-white, with embroidered cushions. There is a small story behind the "Fu Lu Shou" (Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity) trio displayed on the mantelpiece in the living room. When the Japanese forcibly occupied Lushan, they moved the trio from the official residence. Because a Japanese officer was living in the house of the American Consul General Smythe in Tianjin at the time, the trio were moved there. This time, when Madame Chiang came, she discovered that the trio were missing and was very upset, but there was nothing she could do. Coincidentally, Mrs. Smythe invited Madame Chiang to her house to play. As soon as Madame Chiang entered the living room, she realized that the trio were antiques from her mansion. Mrs. Smythe only realized this at this time, so she immediately handed them over to the attendants to send back to the Chairman's residence.</p>
<p>Upstairs on the second floor, there is also a veranda similar to the one downstairs, with similar furnishings, but with an additional sleeping chair. The Chairman and his wife pray, do gymnastics, and read books here in the morning. Above the large living room is the bedroom, behind it is the Chairman's study, and next door is Madame Chiang's study, as well as a small living room, a bathroom, and several other rooms. The upstairs reception room is mostly used by Madame Chiang to meet female guests. The furniture and curtains are in the same colors as downstairs. Madame Chiang does not like walls and furniture painted with stimulating colors; she prefers light yellow and milky-white paint. In addition to the large veranda, there is also a small veranda behind the small living room, but the two verandas are not connected.</p>
<p>The Chairman's official residence used to have its own generator, but it was taken away by the enemy! The electricity now used is generated by the public power plant, and it goes off at midnight.</p>
<p>The architecture of this mansion can truly be said to be very old. However, the Chairman and his wife both prefer to live in their original old home. Although it is somewhat dilapidated, it brings them a sense of familiarity and profound feeling.</p>
<p>Bird's-Eye View of Shasta Dam</p>
<p>Shasta Dam is located on the Sacramento River in northwestern California and is the fourth largest dam in the world. It is four hundred and eighty feet high and stores more than 1,100,000 acre-feet of water. The 29-mile-long lake is a center for recreation, with hotels and other facilities. The dam was built at an accelerated pace in three years, and its first power plant began generating electricity in January 1945. Fontana Dam is an important part of the TVA's plan for flood control, irrigation, and power generation. (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<h3>TVA: A Paradise in the Mountains and Valleys of Tennessee</h3>
<p>— Airmail Report from the 16th, Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing stationed in the United States</p>
<p>Tennessee is an elongated parallelogram, surrounded by mountains on all sides. My image of Tennessee is like Sichuan in China, and some places are very similar to Guizhou and Yunnan. The southeastern corner of the United States is an agricultural mountain country, just as the southwestern mountains of China are still rich in agriculture. Americans have two nicknames for Tennesseans: one is called "Volunteer," which is said to be a story from the Civil War era. President Lincoln recruited brave warriors from the South to volunteer for service. Tennesseans, born in the mountains, were known for their bravery, so they volunteered as "Volunteers." Although this is a nickname, it is also a fact. Now that the United States is recruiting volunteers nationwide, many young people from Tennessee are actively joining the military.</p>
<p>Tennessee's Length and Breadth</p>
<p>Another nickname for Tennesseans is "Hill Billy," which means "ruralized." In Shanghai dialect, it is called "xiangqu." Tennessee is mostly mountainous, and many Tennesseans living in the mountains and valleys cultivate their own land and have little contact with the outside world. Therefore, when they go to New York or Chicago, they see novelty everywhere and are inevitably flustered. This, of course, describes only a part of the population. In fact, there are many people of this type in Tennessee. Zhang Renjia, a student at the University of Tennessee, told me that many Tennesseans living in deep mountain valleys have been almost isolated from the world for decades. When they see the latest material civilization of the United States, they may be even more surprised than we are.</p>
<p>For example, people in New York and Chicago seem to be accustomed to taking pictures, but in the rural areas of Tennessee, it is still considered a "big deal." When a farm child in Tennessee is taken to have a photo taken, he may jump up with joy, or he may solemnly go home to change his clothes and come back. Social interaction between men and women in the countryside of Tennessee is very conservative. They are polite and fully retain the "gentleman" tradition of English immigrants.</p>
<p>These different habits are largely due to growing up in the mountains. Before the TVA came to Tennessee, Tennessee was one of the poorest states in the forty-eight states of the United States. Although the southwestern states of New Mexico and Arizona are mostly deserts, they have had irrigation systems for a long time. The soil of Tennessee is red soil, and there are also many bare stone mountains like those in Sichuan and Guizhou. Every year in the early summer rainy season, the "mountain floods" in the eastern mountains rush down like wolves and tigers, and many fields, houses, livestock, and even entire market towns in Tennessee are submerged in the flood. The floodwaters flow from the Tennessee River into the Ohio River, and then into the Mississippi River, flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. After the water recedes, the land in Tennessee returns to drought. Thus, back and forth, the agriculture of Tennessee is: "Nine years of drought in ten years." The honest and simple farmers of Tennessee live in sorrow and gloom all year round.</p>
<p>Great Construction</p>
<p>However, a great construction has changed their entire world. This is the TVA. I cannot help but praise the greatness of the TVA, especially from the perspective of someone coming from the ruined rural areas of China. When I returned to Knoxville after visiting the dam project, my friend Schaffer from the news department asked me about my impressions. I told him, "I am not a power expert, nor an agricultural expert; therefore, I do not understand many of the technical issues inside. But I understand one thing, and that is that China needs it!"</p>
<p>There are ten thousand things to say, and I don't know where to start. Well, let me first introduce a farmer from Tennessee, Samuel.</p>
<p>I met Samuel on the fifth day of my visit to Tennessee. That day, Judge Percy of the Supreme Court of Belgium and I visited the Fort Loudoun Dam. Because we wanted to understand the agriculture of Tennessee, the管理局 (Administration Bureau) specifically sent an agricultural expert, Mr. Blanc, to accompany us. After returning from the dam, we circled around in the nearby fields and finally found Samuel's house.</p>
<p>Samuel's three generations of family live on a farm. His father, Old Samuel, is over seventy years old, and his speech is already slurred. His children are all young and cannot help with farming. Therefore, the responsibility of production for the whole family rests on him alone. He farms one hundred acres of land (equivalent to 600 acres in China) by himself. Sometimes, he feels slightly overwhelmed, but he has machines, so harvesting and planting are not a problem. He led us to see his fields on the hillside and at the foot of the mountain, with sorghum, tobacco, wheat, tomatoes, and soybeans. He said that nine years ago, this was all uncultivable wasteland, and everything was washed away by floods. However, since the TVA dam was built, he has had "fertilizer" (provided by the TVA) that doesn't cost money, and he has several harvests every year. Last month, he harvested four acres of wheat, yielding a total of 104 bushels.</p>
<p>He only has to pay the government forty-two yuan in taxes for one hundred acres of land each year. He raises twenty-nine head of cattle and sometimes uses animal power to help with farming, because he only has two machines. He said that he still lacks a machine for harvesting sorghum, so manpower is very wasteful. Teachers and students from the Agricultural College of the University of Tennessee come every season to help him improve seeds and remove "pests and diseases" from crops, and also guide him on how to rotate crops such as tobacco and sorghum in the same land.</p>
<p>The entire TVA does not have special irrigation projects. I asked him: If it doesn't rain for a long time, how do you divert water up the hillside? He scratched his head and could not answer. He said: It won't happen, it will definitely rain! He also said: As long as there are no floods, this will definitely be a year of abundance. The TVA has already done this for them.</p>
<p>Samuel is a thirty-five-year-old middle-aged farmer, wearing a pair of broken leather shoes on his muddy legs. His face and arms are covered with hair, and his skin is tanned red and purple by the sun. He speaks with a touch of simplicity and charm. He is a typical Tennessee "country elder."</p>
<p>The Story of History</p>
<p>Why is the TVA able to win the support of farmers? Here, we must start with a bit of historical story:</p>
<p>During the First World War, German submarines once reached the Chilean (South American) coast, and the US government was shocked, and then made rapid progress in the defense industry. However, as a result of the advancement, the motivation was not enough. Some people knew that the Tennessee water power could be used to generate electricity to increase power, so they suggested that President Wilson build a dam. The dam was not completed, and the war ended, so the case was shelved. In 1933, President Roosevelt took office. Due to the proposal of Senator Norris, the Tennessee Water Conservancy Project was rebuilt, which gave birth to the so-called TVA.</p>
<p>The full name of TVA is Tennessee Valley Authority, which is a state-owned enterprise directly under the President. (I will introduce these points in another article.) It was established in 1933. At that time, there were three tasks, which were officially passed by Congress and handed over to the Administration Bureau: First, to prevent flooding in the Tennessee River Valley. Second, to dredge the waterways of the Tennessee River. Third, to use hydropower to increase industrial power.</p>
<p>The basic work of these three major tasks is to build dams. Without dams, it is impossible to prevent floods, navigate shipping, or have power. Therefore, people generally think of the TVA as just twenty-six dams, but in fact, the scope of TVA's business is far more than that.</p>
<p>The Tennessee River meanders across the entire state of Tennessee, from the eastern mountainous area to the Mississippi River, the east is high and the west is low, so before there were dams, there were rapids and shoals, like the Jinsha River above Yibin in Sichuan. The TVA's dam projects are distributed on the upper and lower reaches of the Tennessee River and its tributaries. There are many dams in the upper reaches, extending into North Carolina and Georgia. The highest and largest dam, "Fontana," is in North Carolina, and the dam is 480 feet high, parallel to the mountain peaks on both sides. The upper reaches of the Tennessee River thus meander through the valleys.</p>
<p>Norris Dam</p>
<p>This is the first completed TVA project, with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. The dam stores more than 2,250,000 acre-feet of water, of which more than 500,000 acre-feet of water is controlled by fourteen-foot-high gates. The picture shows the amount of water being released from the gates. (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>Fontana Dam</p>
<p>On the day I visited Fontana Dam, a young staff member, Maurice, accompanied me. We set off from Knoxville and had to drive for two hours on mountain roads. The car drove out of the Knoxville basin and entered the mountains. The roads were all narrow paths, leaning against the mountains and facing the valleys, with a bend every three steps and a turn every five steps, very much like the highway from Chongqing to Yuanling. Maurice compared it to the "Burma Road," and was very nervous while driving, fearing that he would collide with oncoming cars on the corners. Near Fontana Dam, there were steep mountains, and Fontana Dam was built parallel to the mountain peaks. From a distance, you could still see the large cement buildings.</p>
<p>The construction of Fontana Dam cost 73 million US dollars, ranking second in the cost of dam projects. The first place is the Kentucky Dam, costing 111.5 million US dollars. Fontana Dam is the highest of the twenty-six dams, with a difference of more than 400 feet between the water level in front of and behind the dam. The dam is entirely made of steel and concrete. Cars can pass over the dam. The water flows from the middle of the dam into the power plant, turning the shafts of the motors, and then flows out of the dam. In this way, Fontana Dam can generate 202,500 kilowatts of electricity. Near Fontana is a place called "Oak Ridge," which was the famous atomic bomb manufacturing plant during the war. The creation of the atomic bomb required a large amount of electricity, and the TVA was responsible for supplying the electricity.</p>

<h3>The Father's Day Promotion Committee asks this newspaper to exclusively collect educational donations</h3>
<p>The names of donors will be published in both Shen and Xin newspapers to show great faith</p>
<p>The Father's Day Promotion Committee sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday regarding the collection of educational donations, saying: "To the General Manager Chen of the Shen Bao Newspaper: With the Father's Day on August 8th approaching, our committee plans to raise educational donations from August 1st to 8th. Please have your newspaper exclusively collect these donations to ensure uniformity. Correspondingly, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will approve this and notify your affiliates to handle this matter. Respectfully, The Father's Day Promotion Committee." It is heard that the committee will not adopt public meetings for this year's Father's Day, but will have each family in the country hold individual commemorations, and believes that the most meaningful commemoration is to donate to the "educational fund" to help out-of-school youth. The method is that the committee's founders and sponsors first lead by example, donating educational funds. Those who donate more than 50,000 yuan will be listed as a team. Those whose fathers are alive will be named "Father's Day Celebration, Wishing Father Health and Happiness Team," and those whose fathers have passed away will be named "Father's Day Commemoration, Continuing Father's Legacy Team." Donations of less than 50,000 yuan will not be listed as a team, but must be at least 1,000 yuan. The names of all donors will be published daily in both the Shen Bao and Xin Wen newspapers to show great faith.</p>
<p>The Father's Day commemoration is the first one to be held after the victory. The committee has notified major cities across the country in advance, and everyone will commemorate it together at that time, so its grandness can be known. Originally, everyone has a father, and everyone should commemorate Father's Day. If the commemoration is empty, it is only temporary in nature, and as time and circumstances change, what is the meaning of this? If we can work together and everyone donates a little to the "educational fund" to help orphaned out-of-school youth, it is a good deed that kills two birds with one stone. It is hoped that readers who respect their fathers will unite and "help education" to commemorate their fathers, and "help education" to commemorate their fathers!</p>

<h3>Soda Water: The Most Ideal Summer Beverage</h3>
<p>— Xinghai</p>
<p>Although some consider cold drinks a luxury, broadly speaking, they can be considered a natural physiological need. The summer weather is always very hot, usually around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, we can only dissipate excess heat from our bodies through sweating, which helps maintain a stable body temperature. The hotter the weather, the more we sweat, and the thirstier we become. This is a clear indication that the body needs to replenish water.</p>
<p>Soda water and ice cream are two main food items. However, it is quite a stretch to call ice cream a beverage. Ice cream is a delicious food that is suitable for both summer and winter. Its thirst-quenching effect is minimal. Ice cream contains very little water and is too sweet and rich; sometimes, it even makes you feel drier.</p>
<p>Only soda water is the ideal summer beverage.</p>
<p>Soda water has a low sugar content, and its concentration is roughly equivalent to the osmotic pressure of blood. It can replenish the water lost through sweating. The carbon dioxide in soda water also aids digestion and refreshes and cools the body.</p>
<p>Soda water can meet the needs of the masses, from high-ranking officials to ordinary laborers. Therefore, the soda water industry has developed rapidly in recent years. In addition to soda water factories with a considerable history, such as Zheng Guanghe, Watson's, Victory, Tianhua, Central, Zhonghua, and Yili, many small-scale soda water factories have also been established this year to compensate for the overdemand. However, some small soda water factories inevitably have crude equipment. This concerns public health, and we urge the health authorities to pay due attention to it.</p>
<h3>Picnic in the Summer Heat</h3>
<p>— Yizi</p>
<p>Mount Lu is one of China's famous mountains, located about two to three kilometers southwest of Jiujiang, nestled between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. Guling is one of the peaks of Mount Lu, and the temperature in the surrounding area is no higher than 75 or 76 degrees Fahrenheit even during the hottest times, making it an excellent summer resort. On the 14th, Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Jiujiang and then to Mount Lu. Mrs. Marshall followed the next day. On the 18th of this month, Special Envoy Marshall also accompanied the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, on a special plane to Mount Lu to see Chairman Chiang and present his credentials.</p>
<p>Facing the broad and tranquil Poyang Lake, on a peak of Mount Lu, about ten miles from Guling, someone, for some reason, gave this scenic spot a beautiful name, calling it "Hanpokou" (Mouth of Holding Poyang), because its imposing manner seems to swallow the entire Poyang Lake. Chairman Chiang and his wife, along with Special Envoy Marshall and his wife, held their first picnic together at Hanpokou from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM yesterday, creating the most beautiful scene for Mount Lu. Chairman Chiang wore his usual military uniform, while his wife wore a Western-style mountain-climbing outfit. Marshal Marshall rarely wore civilian clothes in Nanjing, but since entering Guling, he has almost completely abandoned his military uniform. Of course, yesterday at Hanpokou, he also appeared with a graceful and agile demeanor. Mrs. Marshall has at least several sets of sky-blue Western-style outfits. As far as the reporter remembers, the style and color of her clothes never seem to change.</p>
<p>Four sedan chairs were used, two from Chairman Chiang's residence and the other two ordinary sedan chairs from the China Travel Service. Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Chiang sat in the first two, more comfortable ones, walking ahead, while Marshal Marshall and Chairman Chiang sat in the latter two, walking behind. Meeting reporters on the way, Mrs. Chiang naturally and happily asked, "How did you kids know?" "We knew three days ago." "Ah, you're really 'clairaudient'!"</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang also said to the reporters with a smile, "Are you here to play?" Although these words are simple, those who have come from Nanjing, especially those who have lived as reporters in Chongqing, feel a sense of encouragement. Originally, the Chairman was so diligent and hardworking, managing so many affairs every day, that the opportunities to meet reporters were too few. Therefore, everyone believed that after the victory, there would be more contact with the head of state. Thus, something like the White House press conferences of the US President was also anticipated.</p>
<p>The fresh air on the mountain made the reporters feel that the Chinese "White House press conference" was no longer an ideal but a reality that would come soon. Yesterday at Hanpokou, the Chairman saw us, took photos, and then asked amiably, "Are you news reporters?" "Yes." As soon as we said that, the Chairman nodded and said, "Good."</p>
<p>In addition, during the conversation, the Chairman casually slipped in a foreign word, "Where are we having the 'picnic'?" Of course, the reporters felt it was something precious. The "picnic" itself we didn't get to see, but the summer camp press conference sent us on our way back.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Fans</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>In summer, when you feel the air is sweltering, you instinctively pick up a fan to drive away the stuffy air around you and enjoy a moment of coolness. This is the only function of a fan.</p>
<p>However, fans change their function according to their owners, and their owners' identities can be seen from them.</p>
<p>A hardworking farmer, with a worn-out palm-leaf fan tucked into his waistband, uses it to fan away the foul sweat on his body when he is drenched in sweat, and uses it as a temporary straw hat to block the fierce sun when the sun is scorching; in the evening, when enjoying the cool air, it exerts another special skill, becoming the only tool to drive away mosquitoes, allowing its owner to truly enjoy a moment of happiness. Praising it as "the able do more."</p>
<p>A flamboyant actor, constantly waving a beautiful large paper fan on the stage regardless of the cold or heat, opening and closing it freely; its current function is the only ornament of its owner.</p>
<p>Leisured gentlemen, lying horizontally on a chaise lounge, gently waving a paper fan bringing a gentle breeze, enjoying the blessing of a gentle breeze, a leisurely scene, all expressed by this fan.</p>
<p>Comfortable young masters, intentionally or unintentionally waving an exquisite sandalwood fan, fully enjoying the bursts of sandalwood fragrance, or appreciating drawings by famous people, further expressing their identity as "young masters who wave fans while farmers' hearts are boiling like soup."</p>
<p>Modern young ladies, feeling that waving a fan when going out is a bit outdated, as it would hinder their modern appearance, rarely use fans. However, sometimes they carry a small, exquisite, beautiful colored fan in their purse, sprinkled with a large amount of French night-blooming jasmine. When she chats with you, she will intentionally or unintentionally unfold it, and a strong, fragrant aroma will immediately rush to your nose, making you feel drowsy and your heart flutter, as if you have entered a new-style soul-entrapment formation, deeply making you feel that she is a noble, modern young lady. Even if you see this fan in other places, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of person its owner is.</p>
<p>Students in schools use fans of various colors. In the classroom, boys use them as screens for passing notes, eating peanuts, and reading novels, while girls use them as cover for looking in the mirror, applying lipstick, and writing love letters, exerting another special function.</p>
<p>In addition, there are magicians' fans, dancers' peach-blossom fans for performing nude dances, and reclusive hermits' goose-feather fans that proclaim their extraordinary status, all with their own different uses.</p>
<p>However, here I want to talk about a "king of fans," which not only pales the aforementioned fans in comparison, but even if Princess Iron Fan's fire fan and the Mad Monk Ji Gong's divine fan were to reappear, they would have to yield to it. That is the broken palm-leaf fan discarded next to the stove. Do not underestimate it. Although it is silent, it can turn the sparks in the stove into raging flames, burning piles of bean stalks and boiling beans born from the same root, causing brothers to turn against each other, siblings to fight each other, and ultimately both sides are injured. Then it sits back and reaps the benefits, laughing triumphantly on the side. But it usually hides behind its master, waiting for an opportunity to act. As soon as there is a spark in your stove, it immediately shows its skills, turning a small fire into a big fire, and a big fire into an inextinguishable fire, cooking the entire pot of beans and burning your furniture and even your entire house. It is not restricted by the cold and heat of the four seasons, and can exert its power anytime and anywhere. And its master is a sinister and evil person who incites others from behind at all times, causing the incited to suffer great harm.</p>
<p>Now is summer, also the most popular season for fans. Various kinds of fans are displayed in the market, each with its own purpose. However, you must pay close attention to this kind of fan, because its master is a person, an organization, an institution, or a country. It hides behind these masters, making it impossible for you to defend against. Be vigilant and do not let its wind blow on you, otherwise it will definitely cause unimaginable consequences.</p>

<h3>Summer in Wuhan: Imagining the "Rooftop Mermaids"</h3>
<p>— Nai Xin</p>
<p>From July 1st, it rained heavily for five consecutive days, and the water level of the Yangtze River rose step by step. As of the 7th, the water level had increased to 24.716 meters. According to a telegram from Chongqing, the river rose 18 meters in Chongqing in two days and 8 meters in Wanxian in two days. It seems that although the rain has stopped, Hankou will rise sharply again in three or four days. Some people say that this heavy rain was affected by the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb. In fact, this is doing voluntary publicity for the atomic bomb, which is very absurd, because before July 1st, the climate in Wuhan was hot and dry, which was a sign of heavy rain. Coincidentally, the atomic bomb was detonated on July 1st, and heavy rain also came. This is just a coincidence. According to Eastern meteorologists, the Yangtze River has a major flood every 20 years. The last one was in 1931, so it shouldn't be time for another one this year. However, nature often plays jokes on humans. You say it won't come? It insists on coming. This year the climate is abnormal, and the old embankments along the river have been neglected and dilapidated for many years during the occupation period. Therefore, a major flood like that of 1931 may come early this year.</p>
<p>Hankou has been tense for the past few days. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau is working around the clock during the emergency period. Various organizations and groups have organized a flood prevention committee, holding meetings every day, busy with their hands and feet in a mess. The dikes and sluices are ready to be sealed, the pumps are ready, and the sewer openings are about to be closed... But what about the funds? Everyone is shirking responsibility, and there is still not a penny. Mr. Zhou Cangbai, director of the Hubei branch of the Post-War Relief Administration, said at the meeting yesterday: "I hope everyone who has money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength, and mobilize all citizens to prevent floods. Our branch has no problem, but the money is foreign money, and we can't make decisions, so I hope everyone will contribute money first. We will definitely provide support when necessary. Because this concerns the lives and property of all Hankou citizens." Someone joked that the Relief Administration is the Post-War Relief Administration and only takes care of "post-war relief."</p>
<p>The tragic situation of the "rooftop mermaids" during the 1931 flood is still remembered by some. The streets were more than ten feet deep, and only the tops of the buildings were left in the city. People climbed out of the windows and took boats... Let's hope that Miss Yangtze River doesn't get angry!</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Mount Lu</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xi</p>
<p>The weather is sweltering. I sit alone in the small courtyard late at night, looking up at the white clouds rolling and stretching in the sky, watching the waning moon, feeling very leisurely. Although there is no breeze at this time, I feel very peaceful in my heart. Looking at the white clouds in the sky, I am reminded of Mount Lu, a summer resort.</p>
<p>The beauty of Mount Lu is truly beyond words. After eight years of not setting foot in that land, I still deeply miss her every summer. It's not just the towering peaks, secluded and strange ravines, majestic waterfalls, and many ancient sites and scenic spots dotted among them. What I yearn for most is the clouds. Many poets throughout history have praised them, but unfortunately, I am not...</p>
<p>The clouds of Mount Lu are bizarre and ever-changing. People living in the mountains feel like they are in a mirage, elusive and unfathomable. In summer, many people seeking refuge from the heat gather in the Guling area. Before the war, Guling was extremely rich and bustling. There were many foreigners here. Guling Street had a completely foreign atmosphere. Countless villas of all types and classes of wealthy people surrounded Guling, inlaid among the green mountains and forests, just like dots of flowers on green trees. At night, the electric lights were brightly lit, like stars.</p>
<p>In 1937, when the all-out war of resistance broke out, Mount Lu was the decision-making center. I still remember that after the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge, Tianjin also started fighting. At that time, the situation was serious, and the whole country was shocked. The supreme commander was stationed in Mount Lu, carefully observing the situation and working hard, expressing, "We will never give up peace until peace is hopeless; we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until sacrifice has reached the final moment." For a time, generals gathered in Mount Lu, and the eyes of the world were focused here. Later, the commander made his decision and declared an all-out war of resistance. He then left the mountain, and the August 13th Battle of Shanghai followed, thus opening the curtain on the sacred war of resistance.</p>
<p>I heard that Mount Lu is now planned to be developed into a world park. High-ranking officials from the central government will be stationed in Mount Lu this month for office work, and the summer camp will also open on the 15th. The great cause of the famous mountain is truly admirable!</p>

<h3>On Translation Work</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>Recently, I have often seen many translated novels in bookstores that are difficult to understand. The skill of translating literary works should be to convey the spirit. This point depends on the translator's understanding of the social background. If the translator doesn't understand these, he won't be able to comprehend the spirit of the work, let alone convey it to others. There are also many translations of theoretical books that often leave readers in a fog, not only difficult to understand but also simply inexplicable. Here, we believe that the skill of translating theoretical works lies not in conveying the spirit but in conveying the truth. This point is actually not as difficult as conveying the spirit, but unfortunately, people who translate theoretical works often do not fully understand the works they are translating. How can their translations enable others to understand?</p>
<p>If we briefly analyze why this phenomenon occurs in the Chinese translation world, it is not difficult to find the reason. Originally, people engaged in translation work in China can be roughly divided into two types. One type is the "translation craftsman." They are quite proficient in a certain foreign language, so they translate any work written in that language, whether it is a novel, economics, or philosophy. They rely on translation as their main source of income. The other type is beginners. They specialize in studying a certain field. For their own convenience or out of eagerness to introduce works, they rashly undertake to translate a famous work without asking themselves: Are they able to use translation tools? Are they proficient in the content they are translating? They rely on translation as an introduction to research.</p>
<p>We believe that this phenomenon should be avoided. We need Chinese experts to undertake part of the translation work. We know that the Chinese academic community needs creativity, and we also believe that Chinese academic creativity needs the cultivation and nourishment of foreign culture. Otherwise, eclectic creation will be fragile and impoverished. Therefore, the importance of translation work is no less than that of creation. We hope that experts who are proficient in foreign languages and have specialized research in a certain field will introduce more masterpieces in that field to China.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that the Chinese publishing community will welcome this type of translation more and not be too profit-oriented, but do some cultural work for the country.</p>
<h3>Review of "American Foreign Policy"</h3>
<p>— Sun Hang</p>
<p>By Walter Lippmann, translated by Luo Yinpu</p>
<p>Published by Chongqing Da Shi Dai Bookstore</p>
<p>Those who study American foreign policy say that it is like a pendulum. The pendulum swings left and then right, representing America's shifts between isolationism and cooperation with the world.</p>
<p>To this day, many people regret this policy. Some even say that after World War I, the American pendulum swung back to isolationism, betraying President Wilson's benevolent intentions and rejecting the proposal to join the League of Nations, which was one of the causes of World War II. If at that time, America had cooperated with the world, joined the League of Nations, and advocated a little justice, then totalitarian countries would not have dared to take risks, and the world could have saved many lives and much property.</p>
<p>However, there is also a good side to this swing of the American pendulum, which is that after experiencing the vicissitudes of the war and deeply suffering from this policy, the pendulum will no longer swing back. Many progressive elements in the United States have long understood the need for international peace and the impossibility of America staying out of it, and the general public is gradually showing aversion to isolationism and leaning towards world cooperation. Because if Americans continue to remain aloof, atomic bombs will soon be flying to Washington.</p>
<p>Therefore, American foreign policy must be re-examined and embark on a revolutionary stage. Its task is to maintain America's established position and honor as a world leader while also seeking to foster genuine cooperation and peace among nations.</p>
<p>Politician and Political Commentator</p>
<p>Mr. Walter Lippmann's recent book "American Foreign Policy" offers insightful commentary and practical contributions to this end. Lippmann is a politician and a renowned political commentator both at home and abroad. It is said that he was one of the behind-the-scenes writers of Wilson's famous Fourteen Points after World War I.</p>
<p>"American Foreign Policy" is a slim book, but its content is substantial and every word is meaningful. It addresses current issues and offers many constructive ideas, so it sells well in America and has become almost a household staple. Chongqing Da Shi Dai Bookstore has published a translation by Luo Yinpu, with a very fluent translation. It is also available for sale in various police stations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. The first part reviews the past, explaining the vacillation and contradictions of American foreign policy over the past half-century. The second part is the author's opinion on future policy, in which he strongly advocates that Americans should cooperate with the world and should no longer adhere to isolationism.</p>
<p>The Central Idea of the Entire Book</p>
<p>The central idea that runs through the entire book is: "How can America assume its foreign commitments?" In 1823, President Monroe announced that the Americas were for Americans, and America began to have foreign commitments. In order to prevent the encroachment of the great powers on South America, America must possess a strength sufficient to shoulder this responsibility. Later, America extended its influence in the Pacific Ocean. After Spain ceded the Philippines in 1899, its responsibility extended to places six or seven thousand nautical miles from its homeland.</p>
<p>However, American policymakers only took on the responsibility without strengthening their strength to balance it. Americans advocated disarmament in world conferences, and tolerated the Japanese building defensive works in the center of the Pacific that were hostile to Americans. They even opposed concerned friends, especially Britain, believing it to be a victory. These things directly or indirectly reduced America's strength and assistance, and almost led to the danger of America collapsing in this war.</p>
<p>Strength is Military and Allies</p>
<p>Therefore, Lippmann believes that if Americans are to assume foreign responsibilities, they must first have the strength commensurate with those responsibilities. This strength lies on one hand in extensive military preparations, and on the other hand in many friends. Lippmann said: "It is dangerous for one person to fight against many, but it is safe to stand on the side of many to fight against one person." He believes that Germany's initial victory in this war was because it was able to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union and carefully cultivate American isolationism. Surrounding Japan were the Soviet Union, China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, but none of these countries were its friends, and its only ally was the distant Germany, which could not provide timely help. Therefore, it was destined to fail.</p>
<p>America must find many allies in order to shoulder those foreign responsibilities, and this is precisely the mission of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Four-Power Core Alliance</p>
<p>Therefore, Lippmann finally strongly advocates that the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China (if China is strong) should form a core alliance as the cornerstone of world peace. Lippmann strongly emphasizes the inevitability and necessity of the United States and Britain uniting, and his argument is very similar to that of Churchill.</p>
<p>However, this book is specifically written for Americans, so its arguments are all from an American perspective. When we Chinese read it, there are some places where we inevitably feel a bit alienated, and when it comes to expanding military preparations and shouldering responsibilities, we feel particularly alarmed.</p>
<p>A Few Opinions from the Chinese</p>
<p>We greatly admire Mr. Lippmann's advice to Americans to abandon their isolationist policy, but as a Chinese person or as a peace-loving cosmopolitan, there are a few points regarding Lippmann's foreign policy that must be discussed:</p>
<p>First, America's foreign responsibilities extend six or seven thousand nautical miles from its homeland, and Lippmann even says that China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence are almost one of those responsibilities. America being able to shoulder this huge responsibility is certainly a boon and a blessing to the world. However, if America's power is insufficient but it insists on shouldering this responsibility, it will only cause chaos and endless strife in the world. Therefore, in addition to finding ways to assume this responsibility, American foreign policy must also find ways to reduce this responsibility to match its strength. Lippmann's failure to see this is regrettable.</p>
<p>Second, "foreign responsibility" is a delicate term. When Lippmann says that China is one of America's foreign responsibilities, we do not know whether Lippmann is treating China as the Philippines was three years ago, or as a distressed friend in need of help. To put it more bluntly, will America's gradual expansion of power in the Pacific extend to the Asian continent and even Central Asia? We are deeply grateful for America's promises and goodwill assistance to China, and we will never forget it. But when its responsibilities gradually expand and meet the responsibilities of other countries, we become worried about world peace.</p>
<h3>Reading Quotes</h3>
<p>— Wu Caolu</p>
<p>"Now, instead of pursuing practical learning through personal experience, people engage in textual criticism, discussing how someone describes human nature. This is not the way of a good scholar. Confucius and Mencius did not teach people this way. For example, if you want to go to Beijing, observe the stages of the journey, and then hire a boat, buy a horse, and set off immediately. Within two months, you can arrive in Beijing and see what the palaces, streets, wind, sand, and customs are like, all of which you will understand for yourself, without having to ask others. Now, instead of seeking to reach Beijing, people just meticulously study the records of those who have been there, comparing them and finding discrepancies in their accounts, which only adds to the confusion. Because they do not personally go to the place, but rely solely on the words of others, the more they seek, the further they get from the truth." (Essence of Rough Words)</p>
<h3>How the Steel Was Tempered</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jia'ai</p>
<p>"The most precious thing a person has is life, and life is only given to us once. A person's life should be lived in such a way that when they look back on the past, they do not regret wasting their years, nor are they ashamed of their past incompetence. Then, when they are about to die, they can say: 'My entire life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the freedom and liberation of mankind.'" These are the words spoken by Nikolai Ostrovsky, through the voice of the protagonist Paul, in his great work "How the Steel Was Tempered."</p>
<p>Ostrovsky was a Soviet genius writer. He wrote two novels: "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "Born of the Storm." These two titles and themes are symbolic of his entire life—he grew up in hardship, and he stood up strongly, as resilient as steel. He suffered wounds during the revolution, becoming blind and disabled. Therefore, his works were all dictated and recorded by others.</p>
<p>"How the Steel Was Tempered" is Ostrovsky's first work, published in 1932. It immediately caused a sensation in the entire Soviet literary world. In seven years, it was reprinted one hundred times, selling approximately 3.5 million copies, and was translated into various languages and made into a film (which was recently shown in Shanghai). In 1935, the author received the honorary "Lenin" Medal from the Soviet government for this novel.</p>
<p>The book is set in the Soviet Union during the civil war from 1917 to 1922, and tells the story of the glorious struggle of a young Bolshevik. When the story begins, Paul Korchagin is only twelve years old. Because he is not welcome at school, he drops out and works in the kitchen of a railway station, where he lives for two years. There, he begins to learn about many unreasonable and ugly things in the world. Soon the revolution begins, and Paul becomes very interested in this turbulent era. He secretly does some things that he thinks are brave. Once, he is imprisoned for rescuing a sailor. As a result, he uses his wit to escape from death. From then on, he decides to participate in the heroic civil war. During this period, he suffers many serious injuries, but he never gives up, persisting to the end, until the post-war reconstruction and political work. The story also has lighthearted moments, such as Paul's love affair with Tonya. Tonya is the daughter of the forestry director, and her thinking is not thorough enough. In particular, her leisurely individualism wearies Paul. Their friendship gradually fades.</p>
<p>Paul in the book is really the author's own embodiment, and the content is entirely based on real experiences, so it is written vividly and realistically. His style is direct and strong. However, through artistic rendering, many scenes appear very beautiful and delicate, especially during the period when Paul and Tonya meet. The author uses delicate brushstrokes in psychological analysis, which is very fascinating. At the same time, the excellence of the technique and the compactness of the layout are simply unbelievable. This was dictated and recorded by someone else for him. In addition to its literary contributions, Ostrovsky's work has a more powerful inspiration for young people: life is by no means fragile; in the crucible of a great era, if you have a strong will, boundless strength, and enthusiasm, you can be as tough as steel, and you will not be like dust, which will disappear in an instant.</p>
<p>This novel translated into Chinese is about 120,000 words long. We have seen two translations in bookstores: one is translated by Mei Yi, published by Xinzhi Bookstore; and the other is a joint translation by Duan Luofu and Chen Feihuang, published by Chaofeng Publishing House. Relatively speaking, Mei Yi's style is more fluent and moving to read.</p>
<p>Regarding Ostrovsky's life, here is a brief introduction: He was born on September 29, 1904, in the village of Shepetovka in the Volyn province, located between Ukraine and Poland. This was a poor railway worker's family. His father died early, and his mother worked as a cook in a "wealthy family." His older brother was an ironworker in a railway repair factory. The family's livelihood depended entirely on meager wages. Ostrovsky entered elementary school at the age of six, and at the age of twelve, he went out to earn a living on his own. He herded horses, worked as a teaboy in a station restaurant, and worked as a laborer. Later, he worked as a stoker and power plant worker for a while. At the age of fifteen, he joined the civil war. In one battle, he was seriously injured. After recovering, he continued to dedicate himself to the revolution. In 1927, he developed hemiplegia, unable to move his limbs, and also went blind. This was the greatest suffering of his life. At this time, although Ostrovsky's body had died, his heart was still active. He resolved to convey his past experiences in literary language. So, in 1928, he began to create. His first masterpiece, "How the Steel Was Tempered," was published and achieved amazing success. At the end of 1936 (December 20), he passed away, but his second novel, "Born of the Storm," was not yet completed. However, after the book was published, it was also warmly welcomed by Soviet readers, with forty editions and 1.5 million copies printed in the two or three years after his death.</p>
<p>Ostrovsky used a determined spirit to complete his own writing. He once said, "No one can stop me from doing this. I feel healthy only when I am working." He was just like what he had said: "My entire life and energy have been dedicated to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the freedom and liberation of mankind."</p>

<h3>Preparation for Creation</h3>
<p>— Author: Mao Dun, translated by Naya</p>
<p>Friends who love to write, especially those who are starting to write, need a book that indicates the correct writing methods to supplement their skills and cultivation. Here, I would like to introduce a more suitable book to you, which is Mr. Mao Dun's "Preparation for Creation."</p>
<p>A great writer is not only an artist, but also a thinker—in modern times, and at the same time, he must be a tireless warrior. His works not only reflect reality, but also consistently embody the life problems and ideological problems of his era, and he proposes answers.</p>
<p>Only in this way can he be considered a writer—an accomplished writer. You who are learning to write can diligently study hard until you succeed. Of course, it will take a lot of time. Research is not imitation. Research is learning the techniques, while imitation is simply and completely plagiarizing the appearance. So how should we learn? That should be from extensive reading to selective research.</p>
<p>For friends who are just starting to write, basic practice is necessary. Understand the theme and development of the characters in your work, and then collect materials. Then you must abide by the four words "select the best and use widely." You should squeeze and refine these materials.</p>
<p>When you write about a character, you must observe from many aspects, so that this "character" is not quite "someone we actually know," yet it is "very familiar." Among "our acquaintances" there are shadows of "him," a bit like "him," but not quite "him." Everyone is a bit like "him," but not "completely" like "him." You can meet "him" everywhere, but you cannot identify "him" as a specific person.</p>
<p>A character like this is successful, such as the familiar Ah Q.</p>
<p>With accurate characters, you also need a "broad environment" to allow him to live and express himself in this environment.</p>
<p>Having obtained accurate characters and environment, the prelude to writing is to compile an outline, which allows you to check whether your material is sufficient and whether there are still unclear areas.</p>
<p>Writing requires hard work. The so-called "careful creation" and "technical polishing" are all about this, and there is no clever trick.</p>
<p>If you have finished writing a work and you are not satisfied with it, and you are troubled by the fact that you don't know where the problem lies, then don't be discouraged or annoyed. You can work hard as usual, but put the work away. After some time, read it again, and you may see some problems that you were not previously aware of.</p>
<p>Finally, in writing, it firmly says that there are no "shortcuts" or "secrets."</p>
<p>I will not say more. I hope that friends who love to write can read this book and follow it, and one day they will naturally succeed.</p>

<h3>A Remembrance of Friendship</h3>
<p>— Xue Tianran</p>
<p>Shi Ming was indeed a lovable friend. I can't help but miss him; his passion and sincerity moved me profoundly.</p>
<p>Even though we are separated, his image lingers in my mind, making me realize how precious and warm friendship in this world can be.</p>
<p>I first met Shi Ming in the spring of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938]; at that time, the waves of the War of Resistance were surging vigorously, and he and I were in the same guerrilla unit engaged in national salvation work. Looking back, I should feel quite apologetic because, due to my pride, I was so indifferent to comrades like Shi Ming, who didn't bear much responsibility. So much so that when we met again five years later, I couldn't even remember that he had been my colleague for a month. Hearing him vividly describe my active role back then, I felt deeply ashamed. Shi Ming! What reason did I have to neglect you and shut you out?</p>
<p>After our reunion, we became close from then on. He was as considerate as a girl is to her lover. In terms of living, he helped me so much. Most of the trivial matters were taken care of and resolved by him, freeing me from worrying about inconveniences everywhere in this new organization. In our frequent interactions, I suddenly discovered his writing talent one day. He didn't seem to have received a good school education, but the poems and essays before my eyes clearly seemed to come from the hand of a young writer, moving and graceful, with beautifully and elegantly crafted language. I was amazed and developed respect and goodwill towards him as if discovering a miracle.</p>
<p>The wartime environment was always turbulent and unstable. Before half a month had passed, I had to leave for business, and it so happened that he was assigned to work in another village. Therefore, I didn't even have time to inform him, and had to leave him a letter, separating from him with melancholy.</p>
<p>In the following two years, life underwent enormous changes. One of the fortunate things was that Shi Ming finally lived with me again. Shared suffering easily breeds sympathy. We lived together in poverty, spending our days in both pain and optimism. Gradually, I came to understand everything about Shi Ming, including the most minute details. He also gradually understood my character and personality. He was rich in emotions, treating people with a truly sincere heart. He was willing to endure hardship himself, leaving the better portion for me to enjoy. Especially in his concept of economy, there was absolutely no selfishness at all. It was not only "his is mine," but he wished he could use all he had and could have to exchange for my happiness and satisfaction. I received his help several times, all when I was at my wit's end. He sold his only clothes and sweaters, sacrificed his sister's gold ring, and ran around for a whole day, collecting money from all his friends to help me overcome successive disasters. As a sojourner in this completely unfamiliar small city, I was almost moved to tears by his loyalty and righteousness at the time. Even now, I cannot use any adjectives to adequately express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Shi Ming was one year older than me. He came from a silk shop apprenticeship. When the storm of the great era descended upon China, he accepted the enlightenment of new ideas. Like many other educated young people, with a full sense of patriotic enthusiasm, he stepped onto the battlefield and threw himself into the torrent of the great national liberation. Shi Ming not only slowly absorbed knowledge of social science and philosophy, enriching his theoretical cultivation, but also absorbed invaluable experience and training, making him a daring fighter. He eventually jumped from the position of clerk and political work team member to the position of section chief and secretary. Just when he was looking forward to his future with joy and pride, the enemy's cruel mopping-up and lightning-like attack penetrated the guerrilla area, and a large number of workers withdrew, with Shi Ming being one of them.</p>
<p>Soon, Shi Ming began to appear in the occupied areas, and settled down. The time when he and I were inseparable was at that stage. We were both penniless, and we relied almost entirely on borrowing to get through each day. For a few days, we even sang "empty city stratagems" to overcome the threat of hunger with hope and singing. However, although the environment was extremely difficult, the shadow of pessimism still couldn't cover our hearts. A simple belief encouraged us: because tomorrow will eventually come, if we grit our teeth and endure today, why should we fear that victory does not belong to us? Especially Shi Ming's optimism, he seemed to regard any difficulty as unimportant. He confidently believed that anything that had been done, was being done, or was about to be done was "absolutely guaranteed" and "completely possible to succeed." He developed a habit of exaggerating when he spoke, and revealed an "self-satisfied" Ah Q-like habit everywhere. However, this did not detract from my impression of him, who was very familiar with him; the environment was too bad, and to persist in the struggle in the dark, one must have the greatest patience and perseverance. Shi Ming's personality directly increased my courage and resisted the weakness that came by chance.</p>
<p>Danger and hunger passed one by one and moved away. Life is indeed a kind of training. Even in a very uneasy mood, we still read several thick theoretical books. Mao Dun's "Corrosion" and many plays by Xia Yan and Chen Baichen were read while unable to sleep at night. They were like a new kindling that was stuffed into the hearts of me and Shi Ming, burning brightly with light and heat. There were also theatrical performances in this small city. Yao Ming watched "Grape Wine" (i.e., You Jing's "Night Light Cup"), and his emotions were so intense that he said to me with tears in his eyes: "I am not afraid of sacrifice. Revolution needs to be exchanged with the price of blood." I shook his hand and said: "I wish you success." I only felt a hot current rolling endlessly.</p>
<p>Four months later, my safety became a problem, and then I hid here and there until the enemy surrendered. I have not received any news from Shi Ming since we separated, but I believe that he is definitely still alive, living even more happily and actively. "Friendship built in battle and hardship is the most precious feeling in the world." I cannot forget Shi Ming for this reason. Although he also has many shortcomings, he should be seen as an excellent and staunch son of the Chinese nation. I am waiting for that day to come, to tightly hold Shi Ming's hand, to express our longing, and to pour out our pain and joy.</p>
<h3>Daydream</h3>
<p>— Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882)</p>
<p>Collected by Chen Lie at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London</p>
<p>Rossetti's father, Gabriele, was an Italian poet who fled to England due to political reasons and wandered around Europe. Later, he taught at the Royal Academy in London. His son received early instruction at home and showed his artistic talent early on. In 1848, at the age of twenty, he co-founded the so-called early aesthetic movement with Millais and Hunt, which had a significant impact on academic thought in England and Europe. Rossetti's paintings not only faithfully depict the subtle scenes of nature but also incorporate a deep poetic expression. It is evident that Rossetti was not only a painter but also a poet. He was naturally imaginative, but he was also able to describe his ethereal dreams with a practical approach. Most of Rossetti's paintings depict medieval stories, but in 1857, he created illustrations for the poetry collection of the then Poet Laureate, Tennyson. Rossetti was a master of both watercolor and oil painting. This painting, "Daydream," is one of his masterpieces.</p>
<h3>A Dreamless Night</h3>
<p>— Mo Yu</p>
<p>As the gray sky covered the sorrow in every corner of Shanghai, a frenzied joy began to permeate the entrance of Ciro's. Bai Ping stepped into this dance palace, which he was already very familiar with, with unusual emotions today. Just as he was preparing to use the passion in the crowd to wash away the pain that had been eroded by some memories on the road, the manager was already making faces in front of the microphone and raising his voice to shout:</p>
<p>"Miss Bai Ping is here! Does anyone want her to sing a song?" Then, like a torrent of echoes stirred up in a giant valley, the world seemed to be shaken and dazed. Bai Ping held his breath and looked at the hundreds of seductive eyes staring fiercely at him in the dimly blue light and mist of the room. The torment of the past week forced him to put on a smile, so he began to sing:</p>
<p>"I will buy that dream... long ago and far away, I dreamed a dream one day and now that dream is here beside me!..." "What a sweet dream!" In the clamorous atmosphere, as long as one person shouted strangely, it would immediately cause a widespread commotion, because this was everyone's opportunity to show off their charm. They all greedily wanted to find their own desired dream in Bai Ping, so as soon as the song was over, Bai Ping slowly took his dreamlike dance steps in the crowd.</p>
<p>After Bai Ping turned over eight or nine partners, he realized that many of the unfamiliar dancers today were actually philanthropists. They were participating in a charity dance to aid the refugees in northern Jiangsu with great enthusiasm. The words "northern Jiangsu refugees" undoubtedly contained a revealing irony for Bai Ping's reality. He was afraid that this would touch the deeply wounded souls in gorgeous clothes here, so he tried his best to forget everything and pressed his smiling body even closer to the guest on the tenth partner.</p>
<p>"Miss Bai Ping's English is too good!" This was a middle-aged, gentlemanly stranger.</p>
<p>"He's an authentic college student!" The manager always wanted to promote the dancing girl.</p>
<p>"..." Bai Ping glanced at the manager with disgust. This kind of glorious boasting was already regarded by him as a malicious provocation to his own sadness; the gentlemen were smart, and they immediately understood and dismissed the manager, so they changed direction and attacked the depths of her soul! "I believe Miss Bai Ping has a light and beautiful dream!"</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you just sing that you had a dream in the distant past, and this dream is leaning against your side! ... Is this dream allowed me to step into its edge and possess it like you, to get a little warmth?"</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand! There is only bitterness and pain in my dream!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"The eight-year War of Resistance turned my warm home into a dilapidated household, so I began to have bitter dreams. After the victory, even this only dilapidated household property was destroyed by the artillery fire of the Communist Party; I not only couldn't study, but also became a refugee, and now all I have is a painful dream!"</p>
<p>Bai Ping gradually began her habitual sobbing again, but the environment here did not allow her to have this contradictory sadness; as soon as she looked up, she saw a waiter excitedly shouting in front of the microphone:</p>
<p>"Everyone, if you drink one more cup of tea today, you will save one more life! Although we live a hard life in this lowly profession, we will never forget the many tens of thousands of refugees who are living in exile, so I am willing to voluntarily dedicate my small account and wages for one day today, I want to exchange my personal pain for the happiness of tens of thousands of them!"</p>
<p>A thunderous applause awakened Bai Ping's melancholy about dreams, and a new revelation swirled in her mind, she seemed to immediately firm up a new belief:</p>
<p>"I have already fallen into the fire pit, I can't let those kind people repeat my footsteps again, isn't it time for me to sacrifice myself now?" Thinking of this, Bai Ping very skillfully put on a smile that was very suitable for the atmosphere in this room. This smile was quite stimulating and seductive, and the gentlemanly stranger leaned closer to him:</p>
<p>"Miss Bai Ping! Pain can strengthen your will, and bitterness can also inspire your courage, why should you be sad?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I already have courage and determination now!"</p>
<p>"I also want to learn from them today and let those thousands of refugees temporarily gain a little happiness and relief!"</p>
<p>"Are you going to donate everything you have?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am going to start selling my dreams to anyone for charity now!"</p>
<p>When Bai Ping finished saying this sentence, she stood up, her entire beauty of line was simply like a wriggling meat pillar, (this meat pillar shone with infinite vitality that made people intoxicated; these, coupled with the statement that she had just made that made people retreat, immediately unfolded a scene of fierce and gorgeous competition, this gentlemanly consultant had already stood in front of the microphone and was shouting with all his strength:</p>
<p>"Everyone, I believe this is a very painful good news!..."</p>
<p>The room was filled with a rare silence.</p>
<p>"Miss Bai Ping is now willing to sell her dreams to anyone for charity! ... Although her dream is a little bitter, it is absolutely complete; although her dream is mixed with pain, she hopes that someone can give her happiness! Because... because she is going to exchange her greater pain for the happiness of thousands of refugees in northern Jiangsu tonight!" This middle-aged gentleman seemed to be hoarse from being excited by the enthusiasm, but he still stubbornly continued:</p>
<p>"A complete dream cannot be estimated for its value, and the situation is a great act of charity! So I... I am willing to use 200,000 yuan to..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish this sentence, the entire scene had already stirred up a wave of cheers.</p>
<p>"I'm willing to offer 500,000!"</p>
<p>"I'll offer a million!"</p>
<p>"I'll offer...!"</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, without a trace of stinginess, countless flavors of sweetness and bitterness were woven into Bai Ping's heart. She knew that she had become a commodity in this kind of occasion, but she was finally sold at the highest price in the arms of an old and bloated merchant:</p>
<p>"I am willing to donate three million to save those helpless refugees, and at the same time I am willing to donate all my strength to make her happy for the rest of her life!" This old philanthropist nodded reservedly.</p>
<p>The success of this transaction gave the people in the scene many different angles of disappointment; the manager approached Bai Ping's side with a blessed and flattering tone;</p>
<p>"You're really going to save a lot of people tonight!"</p>
<p>"What qualifications do I have to save people? I was rescued by others just like those many refugees."</p>
<p>The melody of "I will buy that dream" was played on the stage again, as if to welcome the success of Bai Ping's charity, and as if to mourn the premature death of Bai Ping's youth. There was an unspeakable contradiction in the air in this dance floor. When people were leisurely chewing on the remnants of their dreams with a trace of dreaminess, Bai Ping was pulled into the car by that bloated and old merchant-like gentleman: "You can disappear from those bitter dreams of the past from now on?" The gentleman intimately put his arm around Bai Ping's waist.</p>
<p>"But, isn't this society constantly creating fresher bitter dreams?"</p>
<p>"But, ... but you shouldn't think of those painful dreams tonight at least."</p>
<p>"Yes, my dream tonight has been exchanged for the happiness of thousands of people, I should be happy."</p>
<p>"The happiness of those thousands of people is indirectly built on your painful sacrifice. You can be proud of this great act of charity!" The old gentleman smiled ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>"Maybe..." Bai Ping stammered a little.</p>
<p>Outside the car window, the long summer seasonal wind was gently fluttering. The melody of "I dreamed a dream one day, and now that dream is here beside me" was thrown far away by the car. Bai Ping saw clearly through her crystal tears that the entire Shanghai was a dreamless night in the smoke and dust of the wheels!</p>
<p>Notes taken on July 27th, 35th year.</p>

<h3>Two Snapshots Shanghai Young Master</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has now decided to hold the "Shanghai Miss" election to help the disaster relief. It concerns the lives of 3.5 million refugees. No one has anything to say and of course fully agrees, but after the charity dance, there will be a "Shanghai Miss" again, which seems to be too much work for the female compatriots, and the men will inevitably feel uneasy!</p>
<p>I would very much like to suggest that the gentlemen of the Relief Association, after the "Shanghai Miss" election, hold another "Shanghai Young Master" or "Shanghai Young Noble" (the name may be discussed in more detail) election, so as to raise donations to help the disaster relief, and saving lives is the top priority, the more the better. As for the method, it is up to the gentlemen of the Association to use their brains.</p>
<p>Movie Advertisements</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, movie theater advertisements were most stimulating. Some people said that it was because of their status. The higher the status, the more they could "show off," but in fact, even if the status is small today, it is still moving. Here are a few sentences at random:</p>
<p>1 Singing and dancing, showing all their skills, jade legs like a forest flying all over the sky, wonderful songs and popular songs.</p>
<p>2 Exhibition of human beauty, soft and fragrant jade, cooling the eyelids; sublimation of song and dance art, bone-eroding and soul-destroying, grabbing the heart.</p>
<p>3 Sour, hot, angry.</p>
<p>4 Dry firewood and raging fire, the unmarried sister-in-law takes a fancy to the eldest brother-in-law, and her heart is greatly moved.</p>
<p>That's enough, no more examples.</p>
<p>Watching movies can be said to be the most affordable and beautiful entertainment today, but I think if you don't have money or time, you can also have enough entertainment by looking at movie advertisements.</p>
<h3>A Joke That Can't Be Made A Sudden Siren</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jun</p>
<p>It was a little after 6 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, and I was at a relative's house preparing to have dinner. The siren went off, and we all heard it very clearly. In any case, the siren would not be sounded at this time. Some people said that the siren was malfunctioning; however, the sound was very long and never stopped. Then another siren sounded. So, we had to turn on the radio to hear what was going on. However, the radio was playing music loudly, and there was no report other than advertisements.</p>
<p>Everyone began to feel nervous. We can't really be blamed. Everyone in Shanghai or the interior has personally experienced what a siren means. Moreover, we all know that Warsaw, London, and even Pearl Harbor have all experienced this kind of sudden siren. A person who has just left the war will not forget the horrors of war so quickly. So, phone calls were made. But no one knew what was going on, not even the security authorities.</p>
<p>The tense atmosphere became even thicker!</p>
<p>I suddenly caught an inspiration and immediately announced: "If this is a siren, then it should be an all-clear signal! Because only an all-clear signal will sound a long tone to the end. An air raid alarm should be one long and two short." People thought about it carefully and felt it made sense. And at this time, dinner was served, and the bubbling beer made us forget about this siren altogether.</p>
<p>The next day, when I opened the newspaper, I found out that the electric wire was broken; the citizens did not know the truth, and were just frightened in vain, etc. It was said so lightly, as if the average person did not even have the knowledge that the siren was malfunctioning.</p>
<p>I don't think we're being paranoid. If this siren had sounded in a major European or American city, even the police who didn't know the truth would have advised people to go to air raid shelters. It's not that we have the shadow of war in our hearts. In this era, people have to guard against some accidents that seem almost impossible. And if the siren that is responsible for transmitting the alarm to the citizens of the city also makes a joke or two, the terrible consequences can be imagined.</p>
<p>The siren is as sacred and correct as the bell in a church. It controls the actions of the entire city; it will never, and must not, be messed with!</p>
<p>Therefore, when the siren is automatically activated due to a malfunction, all measures should be taken to cut off the current immediately; in any case, it should not be allowed to continue sounding for as long as ten minutes. At the same time, the security authorities must be notified immediately, so that the radio station, police cars, or other possible methods can be used to notify the citizens not to panic; in any case, people must not be left in the dark about what is going on for several tens of minutes. Moreover, afterwards, it must not be left unannounced! At least an announcement should be issued to explain the reasons, and in order to prevent the future, the citizens should be told how to distinguish between a real alarm and an "accidental alarm."</p>
<p>This is not making a mountain out of a molehill. Everyone knows the story of the boy who cried wolf! The siren is related to the safety of the entire city, and it cannot cry wolf even once!</p>
<h3>A Very Strange Thing</h3>
<p>— A Su</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to go to the old capital—Beiping, you will definitely see two typical characters in the tram. Just a shake or a nod of the head, and the conductor will tacitly let them pass without having to buy a ticket. Their special terms on the tram are "shake-head ticket" and "nod-head ticket." But you have to have special qualifications. Sometimes, people try to impersonate them, moving their heads in a way that resembles a shake or a nod, hoping to pass. But the conductor has very sharp eyes. Seeing that he looks neither like a ××× nor a loafer, he will loudly ask the person, "Sir, are you a shake-head ticket or a nod-head ticket?"</p>
<h3>Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Li Juqing</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the invitation of a friend, I heard that the Ningbo Fellow Association was holding a solo exhibition of calligrapher Ren Cixiang. I had long admired his name, so I drove over in the afternoon. I saw many couplets and scrolls hanging on the four walls, in regular, cursive, clerical, and seal script, each style distinctive. His writing used both dryness and moisture appropriately, achieving a perfect balance.</p>
<p>Through a friend's introduction, I finally got to know him. Mr. Ren was humble, kind, and amiable. He answered every question earnestly. When asked about his learning, Mr. Ren said that he had been studying calligraphy for decades, only imitating the ancients, experiencing the ancients, silently contemplating the deeds of the virtuous people of the past, being sincere and not seeking shortcuts, diligently and assiduously, thus enjoying great fame. Whenever I face the ink pool, my heart and soul are drawn to it, but I regret my own dull talent, unable to follow in the footsteps of the ancients.</p>
<p>Moreover, in studying calligraphy, one must pay particular attention to character. The ancients said that literature carries the Way and poetry expresses aspirations. Reading books clarifies the principles of sages and worthies, and calligraphy is the expression of one's personality revealed in form and substance. The profoundness of art can be seen in the brushstrokes, revealing whether a person is virtuous or unworthy. For example, if a person is honest and kind, their writing will be simple and steady; if a person is frivolous, their writing will be light and fleeting; the uninhibited are bold, the disciplined are precise, the trendy are charming, and the noble are pure and unrestrained. This is an immutable principle. Therefore, the rise and fall of calligraphy is also related to the fate of the nation. It can greatly change customs and practices, promote national prosperity, and also provide textual research and supplement deficiencies in classics and history. As for the skill of the art, it is actually secondary. Hearing these words, one can see his lifelong research.</p>
<h3>"Smart" and "Fool"</h3>
<p>— Ling Zhuoyan</p>
<p>Regarding students, those who secretly read novels, yellow weeklies, or movie magazines in class; write notes to each other; or ask someone to take their place and go to the movies or dance halls are considered "smart" students. Those who can skip grades, buy diplomas with money, "pass" tests by cheating or carrying cheat sheets are "smart."</p>
<p>Those who listen carefully in class, study hard after class, don't dance, don't know how to flirt, and rely on their true abilities to pass exams, advancing one grade at a time, are all "fools."</p>
<p>Those who know how to dress up, using charming smiles to win love, using lavish manners and clothing to win admiration; when they become old and unattractive, discarding one spouse and marrying another; when their wealth and power decline, divorcing one spouse and marrying another are the most "smart" at love and the most "modern" in marriage.</p>
<p>What mutual understanding, shared interests, sharing joys and sorrows, and growing old together are all things that "fools" do.</p>
<p>When they need you, they are devoted and righteous, but when they don't need you, they discard you like worn-out shoes, treating you like a stranger. This is the most "smart" way to make friends.</p>
<p>What making friends with loyalty and trustworthiness, sharing hardships together, are all things "fools" do!</p>
<p>In society, those who know how to socialize, bribe, boast, flatter, scheme, avoid responsibility, be opportunistic, benefit themselves at the expense of others, be servile to superiors, and be imposing to subordinates are the "smart people" in life!</p>
<p>Embezzling and taking advantage of loopholes is what "smart people" do.</p>
<p>Serving the public faithfully, being loyal to one's duties, and upholding justice are the biggest "fools" in the world!</p>
<p>Those who secretly hoard goods for profit, commit illegal acts, but on the surface pretend to be benevolent and righteous, loyal to the country and the people, establish charitable organizations, public undertakings, and universally save all living beings, and thus get promoted and become wealthy and prominent are the great "smart people"!</p>
<h3>Not Worth a Smile</h3>
<p>— Ben Hui</p>
<p>Doctor: "After so many days of injections, why haven't all the bacteria in your body been killed yet?"</p>
<p>Patient: "Then may I ask the doctor to inject some DDT, because that is the only magic medicine for killing insects and will definitely work immediately."</p>
<p>Father: "You good-for-nothing! You've even started learning to dance!"</p>
<p>Son: "Dad! I'm learning to dance for the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, because this charity dance will help the disaster victims!"</p>
<h3>"People's Grievances" and "Officials' Secrets"</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>The Political Department of the Guangdong Military Headquarters recently convened a symposium of Guangzhou trade associations. Forty-four trade associations, represented by more than fifty people, attended. The chairman asked them to frankly state the pain and difficulties they had experienced in their respective industries, whether political or personal. The conclusions were entirely attributed to political issues. The political pain and difficulties were corruption—one law enacted, one abuse arises; heavy taxes and levies—mines are taxed, mineral products are taxed, businesses are taxed, endlessly; smuggling—organized smuggling: duty-free imported cigarettes flood the market, hitting the sales of domestically produced cigarettes, leading to the closure of more than two-thirds of domestic cigarette factories… The chairman considered it valuable information and said that he would submit it to Director Zhang of the Military Headquarters for instructions, striving to resolve the pain of each industry.</p>
<p>It is said that the significance of the Political Department convening this symposium was to follow Director Zhang's intention to eliminate the separation of "past situations not reaching the top" and "to understand: 1. How to solve the current economic downturn; 2. Where the difficulties in commodity circulation lie; Whether the current tax levies can be reasonable and convenient for the people; 3. How to strengthen communication between labor and management and promote welfare undertakings to avoid labor disputes." Of course, the above three points also contain political elements, but what the representatives of the trade associations stated contradicted this political nature in many ways, going a step further than what Director Zhang had intended to understand. This could not help but make the chairman (Secretary Xie Zhennan of the Political Department) consider it valuable information.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of valuable information is "readily available" in Guangzhou. Perhaps not only in Guangzhou, but in what part of the Republic of China is there not such valuable information? It was just that Director Xie happened to hear a few thousandths of it. However, the fact that Director Xie considers it valuable information shows that the Political Department of the Military Headquarters intends to investigate people's grievances. However, unexpectedly, what was investigated was "officials' secrets." This can imagine how Guangzhou, after the victory, is in the deep and fiery waters of all kinds of "officials' secrets"!</p>
<p>Perhaps the victory gave the people of Guangzhou a courage they had never had before! A few months ago, they dared to tear down the sign of the Good Salvation Branch, and now they dare to expose "officials' secrets" in front of officials. The sentence "one law enacted, one abuse arises" is very powerful, directly pointing out that officials enact a law in order to create an abuse. Secondly, the automobile transportation industry vaguely pointed out that those "local bullies" ride cars without paying and transport goods without paying. In particular, tobacco merchants explained the source of duty-free imported cigarettes and the organized smuggling. These bold accusations are what the officials have long been familiar with. However, being able to be disclosed in the newspaper is considered much more "democratic" (?).</p>
<p>It can be said that Guangzhou's industry and commerce took a mild laxative at that symposium. The accumulation in their chests seemed to have cleansed their intestines and stomachs in the atmosphere of the meeting place. However, whether these accusations will have a fermenting effect remains to be proven by future facts, that is, after Director Zhang's instructions and the "striving to solve." Perhaps Guangzhou's industry and commerce are now very worried, worried that what they provided will only be regarded as "valuable information," "valuable" to the point of being treasured and never having the opportunity to be made public in the future.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's industry and commerce are truly worthy of sympathy. During the ten months since the victory, they have suffered all kinds of grievances that only those involved can understand, especially the various exploitations in the political chaos of the early days of the victory. Now that the Political Department of the Military Headquarters has created this political style, I think it should not disappoint people, right?</p>
