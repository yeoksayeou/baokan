<p>社論</p>
<h3>趕快自動展開節約！</h3>
<p>在最近一期美國出版的「時代」周報上，在「太太們的香實」的標題下，有着這樣一段記載：「上海大美晚報的頭行標題：餓荒日趨嚴重，三千萬人民在中國面臨餓死亡。布層雲籠罩的陰空下，八十位嘉賓坐在舒適的安樂椅上等候迦耐夫人的戰後首次時裝表演。在這位夫人寬廣平軟的草地上所集合的，是上海國際社會的炫耀人物。一個美國石油公司大班的夫人穿着新的春裝傲慢地走了進來，一位冷若冰霜的俄國少婦像拉斐爾畫的聖母那樣戴上一頂非常觸目的藍色包頭坐着。來賓中有半數是中國人，都是服飾華麗的人物。在已過去了的治外法權時代，他們從不曾被邀請到迦耐夫人的服飾沙龍過；可是現在這位夫人的顧客却是「一批顯要的華人。」迦耐夫人說，「他們都是非常，非常富有，非常，非常闊的人。」外國太太們，很當心地另外坐在一起，漫不介意地迎着這個新時代。大美夜報說，約模有四百萬人幾乎一點也得不到救濟，怕不能生存過這空前的炎難……。」這是　極有趣，在我們中國人看來實在是極慚愧的記述。迦耐夫人在中國各地鬧着糧荒的災難下，以賓香酒奉敬到場的太太們，而其中半數以上竟會是中國太太們，瞧着迦耐夫人熱烈展開她時　表現的場面；這對中國是何等諷刺！</p>
<p>另據報載消息，據海關當局非正式發表數字，本年一月份，本市進口貨物，共計價法幣九十三億八千二百八十六萬四千三百二十元，二月份增加至一百五十一億七千三百三十二萬七千二百八十元，三月份進口更增至四百四十二億零八百四十三萬四千三百二十元；出口方面，一月份為五十六億四千一百八十一萬三千九百另四元，該月進出口差額尙不及一倍。二月份出口貨值減少至三十三億另八百九十六萬四千三百另三元，進口較出口超出幾近三倍。三月份出口略為增加，計四十四億六千二百五十七萬一千五百九十元，惟尙趕不及一月份的出口數額，而較同月之進口貨值距離更遠，計相差幾達十倍。換言之，三月份進口與出口為十與一之比。四五月份數字雖未至公布時期，但預料我國目前國際收支不平衡狀態，必較前更為嚴重。又據銀行方面人稱：以中國銀行論，每日結出美匯約在十萬元以上，進口貨除少數化學原料及美棉等外，大部份均係「玻璃皮夾」之類；同時輸出至少出口部幾無人問津。我們不知道政府當局讀了這報告作何感想，他們扼殺生產的政策，竟收到這樣嚴重後果，是否應當負昝？我們更不知道太太們讀了這報告，在競買「玻璃皮夾」之類的時候，有否心頭稍感刺痛？</p>
<p>海關的報告，是怎樣一幅嚴重而沈痛的圖畫！進口與出口為十與一之比，而此項局勢將益趨嚴重，「坐吃山空」，這是如何一種威脅我們民族生存的危機！在這種經濟危難下，在全國普遍鬧着災荒的情形下，上海一般顯要的華人太太，却有心情安坐在迦耐夫人的草坪上，喝着香賓酒，鋻賞着這位俄國太太所製的新裝，爭先恐後，不惜以成千百的美金購置這位夫人所製的春衣；而在中國各處成千成萬幾至無可數的災民却不勝　　而活活餓死。我們呼籲國外救濟，而顯要的太太們却喝着香賓。「時代」周報這一段記載，呌每一個中國人看了都要愧死。真的，每個中國人都要起來遏止這種頹風，要為我們的國家民族保留一些清白，這是每一個中國人的天職。而對着當前的經濟危難，嚴重災荒，以及奢侈淫逸的頹風，我們呼籲全國人民起來自動厲行節約，用緊縮來克服當前的危難。我們不能讓這種奢侈浪費之風再持續下去！</p>
<p>只是為了這些原因，我們曾著論願大家厲行節約，而且希望人民自覺自動地起來厲行節約。自從我們喊出了「願大家厲行節約」以來，我們看見有新任市長的到任。這位新任市長下車之初，即望市民自動節約，在湖北同鄉會的歡迎席上，吳市長表示三點，其中一點就是希望市民一致推行節約運動。可是竟有人以為節約這些小事補救不了上海的市政，更有人以為上海是國際都市，社交場中不能太寒酸，根本不應鼓吹節約。這些喪心病狂之徒，實在幾已沒有靈魂！我們曾說：「節約運動如欲期其成功，不在政府管制的嚴厲，而在人民自動遵行，……全在人民能夠自覺自動起而節約，……與其由政府來規定禁約，不如由社會各界起而自動約法三章，相互遵守。……我們要鼓勵大家比賽節約，糾正競賽奢華的虛榮觀念。」我們覺得遺憾的是市長的勸告，我們的呼號，到如今不曾看見有什麼反響，上海的社會各界也如今還沒有自動起來實行節約。這表示上海人的麻木嗎？決不是，上海市民中儘多通嘵大義之人，愛國惟恐後人，這種節約運動在糾正競賽奢華的頹風，所以為國家民族保留一些元氣，上海人是應該沒有一個不樂於自動推行的。然而市民的節約運動還不曾被推行展開却是事實，我們不能長此因循下去。我們要迅速自動展開全市節約運動。等到政府頒布禁約，那時再來推行　約，這終究是上海人的恥辱。</p>
<p>上海的市民們！上海為全國第一都市，我們要為全國的節約運動樹一楷模，我們趕快應該自動起來推動這個運動。市民的領袖們，尤應該率先提倡，發動各社團各階層來推行這個節約運動。我們要不負這位新市長對我們的一番期望！</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿三日合眾電〕白宮所舉行之鐵路罷工會議，雖經八小時之討論，終告決裂，罷工領袖對杜魯門總統之解決建議，仍置之不理，總統勞工問題史蒂爾曼謂：渠盼罷工能於明日解決，唯勞資雙方，均謂會議毫無進展，美國全國本晚僅有火車數列開班，駕駛者悉非工會人員，各火車站內萬千乘客困待，而食物問題復脅及各大工廠，各種工業日見停頓，一切商務，亦形停止。</p>

<h3>日皇第二次廣播　　為糧食問題作迫切呼籲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕日皇裕仁今日中午以高吭柔和之聲調，向全國作第二次廣播演說，歷時十分鐘，其辭如下：國家復興，首先應謀民眾生活之安定，而尤以糧食為甚。戰時及戰後，對糧食之生產及運輸，已有驚人成績，彼等雖已艱苦努力，而國內各地糧食恐慌，竟反變本加厲，為空前所未有。此種情形，尤以各大城市為最烈，至足令人憂慮。為解決當前局勢，政府採取緊措置，目不待言。惟同時，日本全國民眾，亦應準備刻苦自勵，互相扶助，渡過難關。日本飽受戰禍，創痕猶在，再欲民眾節食受苦，心有不忍。惟不如此則吾人戰後一切努力將擲化。而吾人重建一和平之文明國家，協助推進世界進步之偉大神聖工作，亦因而無從實現。希望全國民眾，能遵守守日本家族國族之優良傳統精神，放棄私利，克服目前危機，向復興建國之途邁進。</p>

<h3>日本一皇族想做汽車夫</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕麥帥昨下令剝除日皇族特樓後，記者走訪曾任陸軍中將之賀陽宮恒憲王，詢以今後新生活。答謂，渠一向主張簡單生活，去年三月私邸遭兵變後，即租賃廣池家房屋八間居住，既無門衛，同居者僅四五書生。故此次命令縱如何影響，並不以為苦。又謂渠自軍隊時代常駕駛汽車，今年四月已向警局請領開車執照，故必要時當有助於謀生。惟就職一事，因牽涉皇室黃範，且因過去係軍人，故必甚困難。目前每月約需一萬元開支，除裁減傭人外，尙須考慮根本對策。要之，當遵照不工作者不可食之原則，與國民同樣生活。</p>
<h3>五強參謀會議　商組國際軍隊　主席否認會議陷僵局</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十四日廣播：五強軍參謀會議，在紐約舉行，已連續兩閱月，迄無結果，其最大原因，係由於蘇聯之不合作。在過去兩月中，每日均舉行會議，業守秘密，雖每次會議之主席為誰，亦無從探悉，但事實上並無守秘密之必要，因所討論者迄今仍限於程序問題也。至於安全理事會所應具之武裝力量，迄未予以討論。據蘇方代表稱：渠離蘇時未獲政府訓令，至目前為止，仍未自政府獲得訓示。</p>

<h3>答復讀者　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）黃文述問　每天讀貴攔的「醫藥衛生，」使我非常佩服。現在我也有幾個問題請教，想來富於服務精神的先生，一定會幫我解決的。敝人（女姓）現年二十一歲目十八歲起繼續發胖，有增無減，不但形式不雅，且妨礙行動上的便利，所以曾用多種方法去避免繼續胖下去，但都無效。（一）此種發胖是否是病態？（二）有何針藥可補救？（三）盡量限制食量是否有效？（四）可吃澱粉質的食品是否可減輕體重？（五）吃肉類是否會增加體重？（六）吃蔬菜水果對體重有何影響？</p>
<p>（張仲明醫師答）異機發胖，係身體內內分泌腺體失常所致，其治療法須先作全身體格檢驗後決定之。限制食量，不一定有效，但少吃肉類脂肪與多吃蔬菜水菓，常練體育，可使體重增加，不致過速。</p>
<p>（二）杜繼英問　余卅二年因患重痧眼而住院，經割治後雖見有效，但染成另一病態，較痧眼更爲痛苦，每隔一二月即發霧一次，病患期中截遠之物體即現糢糊，幷不能閱讀書藉，甚爲苦惱，請問應如何治療？</p>
<p>（張仲明醫師答）貴恙恐係深度痧眼，兼角膜炎，須請眼科專門醫師詳細檢査後，方能治療。</p>
<p>（三）陸國昌問　本人因先天不足，發育較遲，雖成年而無性感，十九歲從劣友染手淫，年餘戒絕，今年已三十，從未有性慾衝動之感覺，近來曾經西醫注射，以及中醫所謂：「秘製奇方」，屢服無效，請問此病應用何法及特效藥爲當？倘承刋諸報端，俾罹斯疾者共沾其惠，則感激尤甚。</p>
<p>（張仲明醫師答）此係性神經衰弱症，宜注射男性荷爾蒙或憐化合物製劑，</p>
<p>（四）陳蕊梅問女人大槪都怕過於肥胖，我也不能例外，我是十六歲的女孩子，本來是不胖不瘦的，因爲在十五歲的秋天害了一次傷寒症之後就發胖了，如果再胖下去，那眞太可怕了。所以我要請先生代我解答這難題，使我能淸瘦點，還有我的同學太矮了，也要請先生吿訴她能長的方法，我們在此敬向先生謝謝。</p>
<p>（張仲明醫師答）身體過胖過矮，無特效藥，多作運動，或可見效。</p>

<p>外幣美鈔適逢低有陸續吸收者，需用外匯者不乏貯鈔心理，無奈金市轉疲，欲漲終無助力，是以晨開二三八〇元，曾微降至二三四〇元，午刻稍回，午後先在二三六〇元左右掙扎，最後仍在二三五〇元內外，結果較前收續降二十五元，港票仍無生氣，再跌五元，港匯以印棉結款停止，供過於求，四二五元有售，印匯五三〇元，美匯掛牌仍平，指定銀行售予某洋行價微降至二〇六〇元。</p>
<h3>公債又被抬高</h3>

<p>長春廿九天（七）</p>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵愼之</p>
<p>長春蘇軍在四月七日開始撤退，西機塲蘇軍在八日晚撤退。當時中央要員，紛紛撤走，新聞同業也相繼離去。我們九日抵長，實是自動冒險飛往，沒有一個朋友讚成我們如此做法。當時留長的政府人員以及中央社劉竹舟兄都奉命守在長春。這時大家希望政府正規軍能適時空運到達，因爲自蘇軍撤退至十四日，有六天功夫，大家以爲如果正規軍駐長春，即大可扼守，甚至長春可能因此免去一塲大戰，可是望眼欲穿，空運消息全無。至於以後空中投送不合口徑的彈藥，亦可證明政府軍方面全無準備。</p>
<p>戰後餘談</p>
<p>關於防守司令陳家珍，是過去瀋陽講武堂出身東北軍舊幹部和趙參謀長家驤共軍將領呂正操都是同學，過去在軍委會任參議，勝利後任東北行少將高參，並兼軍事代表團團員。董彥平臨行，指定他負責軍事，也似乎是在倉促中決定。但就軍事說，臨時掌握，保安隊指揮，並不是一件容易的事；並且這次戰爭規模相當大，在陳過去的軍事生活中，沒有這種經騐。但陳家珍堅定，冷靜，竭智，殫慮執行任務，已付出了所有的力量。</p>
<p>未戰之先，我們曾到各處巡視工事，畏春有不少堅固建築物，足可憑恃抵抗，但保安隊還安設一些預備陣地以及障礙，這些工事當然頗爲草率，十日晚上，蘇軍的二輛坦克車，忽然從市區南部開進來，轉到中央銀行後，又在警察總隊部門口停下，又轉入西方，那些鐵絲網以及草率的工事都被破壞。第二天我們去看，只見保安隊士兵正在修理，長春機關單位雖多，但都空虛了，也沒有統一的組織，面臨緊張局勢，可是誰也指揮不動誰，衡陽市長趙君邁，中長鐵路公司理事劉哲，和經委會委員王家楨在十二日曾聯名給熊主任打一電報，請親來坐鎭。但爲時已遲。一塲大他戰結束，我們所知已經殘不堪的長春，留下尙稱完好的大建物，除開大和旅館外都已燬去，僅滿炭大樓建築還算無恙全市建築物去了百份之四十，死傷中國人，包括老百姓保安隊共的軍在內，至少六千人。</p>
<p>我們自從十九日那天起，在長春的生活，說自由，但又不惑到自由，說不自由，但似乎又有些自由。所謂自由與不自由問的分差，眞是十分微妙。</p>
<p>市長被俘</p>
<p>十九日的上午，槍聲較疏。我們間守衛的共軍，他說：「咱也不知是誰打槍。」後來一個連的政治指導員來，他說：「國民黨的特務份子和漢奸走狗，都會隨時放槍。」但他又承認他們自己的戰士也會隨時亂放機槍，他說：「這是從敵人手裏奪來的試槍的新聲。」</p>
<p>我們將吃早餐的時候，忽然看見空軍司令部的曹隊長，被幾個共軍押送來了。曹穿的黑布棉袍子，外面加一個日本軍大衣，形態十分狼狽。陪他一起進來的，是一位姓白名居仁的科長，他是西面攻城軍師政治指導員劉其人少將的部下。</p>
<p>曹一看見趙君邁還活着，心裏十分歡喜。他說：「我已一天一晚沒有吃東西，沒有睡覺，也沒有洗臉。」</p>
<p>他一面梳洗，一面吿訴我們：「劉竹舟是在昨天隨陳家珍司令突圍。邵愼之在突圍前就沒有看他。兩人生死，不得而知。」我們愕住了，我們的心在暗泣</p>
<p>跟隨曹隊長來的白科長說明了劉其人和孫正請我們去談話的來意，接下來向趙君邁說：「趙市長，你也請去一談吧！」他已經知道趙君邁不再是大公報的楊華白了。</p>
<p>我們兩車子的八，風駛過市。我們辯別出來，劉其人的司令部是原有的郵政總局大樓。</p>
<p>在郵政總局大樓二樓的走廊上，睡滿了傷兵，有的在漫駡，有的在呻吟，更有用奮異的目光，來注視我們。有幾個共軍女戰士，會說一口好的俄國話，她們以爲幾個美國記者是蘇聯人走上來，就說二「羅西，上高！」美國同業聽不到她們說的是什麽，經過繙譯之後。他們說叫自己是美國人，她們也就冷下去了。</p>
<p>在左邊盡頭的房問裏，白科長要趙市長在那裏稍爲等一下，並且要我們先和劉孫談話。趙也只得聽他擺佈，走入那間屋子裏去。世洵好奇的也跟了進去，但見行營的賴秉權處長，吳士毅高參和經委會王任秘書張大同。我們沒有講什麽話。世洵向大同板了一下鬼臉，大同朝他苦笑</p>
<p>我們等了十分鐘光景。我們是被請到一間光綫比較充足的房裏。第一個出來見面的是孫正，他還是板起面孔，嚴肅得一絲笑容都沒有。繼而劉其人也來了。他先向我們慰問，然後說明局勢還沒有穩定，安全起見，最好還是不要出去。我們要求他，我們要看新東西，我們要報導新的史實。他都沒有給我們肯定的答覆，我們最後要求他，我們願寫一張「設如喪身與爾無涉」的自願書，因爲我們的身份，是戰地記者。但是他終於拒絕了我們的要求。他答應情况如好我們可以立刻出去，他答應介紹我們去見共軍攻長春最高指揮官周保中上將，他答應我們有絕對自由採訪的權利。一個鐘點的談話，我們沒有得到甚麽，我們僅知城防司令陳家珍腿部負傷了。</p>
<p>我們走出房門，滿想找趙君邁同我們回去。忽然孫正說：「今天趙先生不回去了，我們負責招待他。」我們知道從今天起，這個僞裝大公報的楊華白，是被俘虜了。但是趙是非常和我們處得來。他雖然直率，我們確都喜歡他。艾伯娜眼看這個畏士康幸的老同學分離了，心裏委實難受。我們要求在離別之前，見他一面。通過了孫正的允許，我們每個人向趙緊握了一下手，大家互道一聲：「珍重」，凄慘而別。</p>
<p>我們失去了自由</p>
<p>原車還是把我們帶回去，我們要求司機停下來，步行到大同廣塲附近那兒去。但見市政府的火焰還沒有息，熱氣黨人，走不過去。</p>
<p>我們依舊回到家裏。趙君邁走了，屋子裹沒有主人，等於人丢去了靈魂，大家都惆悵非凡，找不出甚麼話來起頭。世洵走入臥房，滿想睡覺。不提防床上已經睡了一個人，翻起被蓋，一看不是別人，正是愼之。我們兩個人怔住了，半响說不出話來，我們的喜悅是滿溢在我們有力的擁抱中。大家知道愼之回來了，都很欣慰地歡迎他歸來。愼之在精神上瘦了，在物質上也和世洵遭受到同樣的命運。他的柬西，是經六次的搶刧，他也是一天一夜沒有吃，沒有睡和沒有洗臉。</p>
<p>我們大家也認定今後留在此地的日子，一定不是個短時期。眼前發生問題的是伙食和傭僕。我們在晚飯後，大家開了一個會，決定一切伙食及其他用費，由我們八個人平分，傭僕五人，全部留下來。同時又決定了世洵管伙食，愼之管帳目。</p>
<p>廿日的早晨，我們還是等待劉其人派車子，准許我們出去採訪。可是將近午飯的時候，又來了一個營政治指導員。共軍自營及連的政治指導員，委實有些不大好對付。他們進來一談，一大篇政治理論，而這些政治理論，我們也都懂得，或者比他們的認識更淸楚。他們有時當我們是國民黨的間諜，用話來詐我們，有時當我們是沒有知識而被俘的士兵，用他們的一貫的政治理論來訓導我們。我們委實不願意聽下去，但又不好意思請他們出去，他們愈談愈起勁，我們愈聽愈討厭，我們討厭他們談不出新東西，討厭他們太不了解他們政治意識圈兒以外的東西，更討厭他們橫蠻無理的態度。這些政治指導員，他們沒有認淸我們的記者身份。在他們眼中看我們，我們是優等俘虜。這一個憎厭，後來和中共東北局宣傳部長凱豐談話，那完全不同了。</p>
<p>例如，這位政治指導員，他死命强調過去紅軍萬里長征。其實這些我們懂得比他更多。他說：「我們的足代替了任何交通工具，所以足是我們的光榮。」這句話，我們聽了好幾次了，他除着表示道一點以外，什麼東西都講不出來。我們只得唯唯是聽，敷衍了事。他看我們打不起勁來，也似乎怪沒有趣兒的悄悄地走出去了。</p>
<p>午飯的時候，趙君邁和兩個監視他的共軍，一同回來了。我們奇怪，以爲他釋放了。後來才知道他是來取被蓋的。從他嘴裏，我們知道政府的官吏三十餘人，都監禁在蔣夫人官邸中。當時那屋仍舊稱爲呂公館，是僞滿呂榮寰大臣的官邸。此外，他還吿訴我們美大使館武官芮克少校的安全，但是他駕來的飛機，聽說已經燒壞了。</p>
<p>猛不提防，世洵正走出院子的時候，一個共軍的雪亮亮的刺刀，正對住世洵的胸膛，一面嘿着：「不准出來！」世洵退了回去。其餘的中外同業也都知道了。於是走去詢問那個士兵。他說：「上面的命令不准你們出去！」我們很知道同他沒有什麽分辯。他公然在我們中立性記者寓所的園子裏開槍。我們沒有說什麼，我們知道我們是失去自由了。</p>
<h3>一封抗議書　致周保中將軍</h3>
<p>這一個晚上，我們精神上感到異樣的痛苦，我們更不知今後將會演變到何種程度，因爲事態的發展和我們知道的所謂「安全」與「保護」，完全不是這麼一會事。我們在吃過晚飯後，再也不像昨天那麼自在，大家圍着桌子，作接連英文字母的遊戲。今晚我們很鄭重的決議：決定明天送共方長春總司令周保中一個抗議書。這個抗議書是用英文寫的，由紐約時報李普曼起稿，經過我們全體的同意，大家簽了字，並寫上了我們代表的不同的報社。</p>
<p>抗議書的譯文是這樣的：『長春區八路軍總司令周保中將軍：</p>
<p>在你所指揮下的爲我們守衛的幾個八路軍士兵，已把我們拘禁二三天了。</p>
<p>過去劉其人將軍和孫正將軍都吿訴我們：爲着我們的「安全」，我們的行動是要受限制的。他們也曾說：只要長春戰事一結束，我們可以立刻自由行動。</p>
<p>我們對於他們關心我們的安全，是十分感謝，但是我們也曾向他們指明：危險根本是我們一部份的工作。我們是戰地記者，我們曾在打日本，敗德國，東西大小的戰役中經過來的。我們很渴望，要採訪最新的新開，危險對於我們根本是件尋常的玩意兒。</p>
<p>自從我們和他們談話以後，我們發現守衛的士兵，已經在他命令的執行中，很淸楚底吿訴我們：自由是在武力下消逝了。處在這稱情况下，我們不敢再有什麽冀望，我們只認爲是八路軍的俘虜吧。</p>
<p>長春的戰局早已停止，並且現狀在我們「安全」上該沒有嚴重的危險。因此，我們向你們抗議無理的拘　。我們過去在延安··重慶·北平·和許多中共人員交談，我們都覺得在共軍區域裏的新聞採訪是自由的。並且歡迎我們協助我們得到最新的報導。</p>
<p>我們現在要索還我們的權利。我們更願意和你談談，雖然我們已見過中共方面的毛澤東，周恩來，朱德，葉劍英。</p>
<p>我們並且要求你，准許我們利用中共的電台打電報給北平執行總部派飛機接我們回去希望。你平日恢復我們的自由。」第二天的早上，（廿一日）那位白科長又來了。我們問他是不是可以把這封信，轉給周保中。他說：「一定送到。」白居仁科長是人共黨，不過一年，這是他嘴裏吿訴我們的，事實眞假，不得而知。但我們相信他不會把實話吿訴我們，我們也不相信他進了共黨，才不過一年</p>
<h3>會見周保中</h3>
<p>自居仁快走出屋子的時候，芮克少校忽然來了，他的手槍依舊在他身邊，我們高興得不知什麽似的。我們向他訴說我們對於他的關懷，他也說電話打不通，戰火又太强烈，一時通不過來，我們一時忘記了一切不自由的痛苦，大家又擠在圓桌上，教廚司多添了幾個菜。芮克和貝克特痛飲在伏特加酒中。</p>
<p>芮克少校喜歡中國菜，有美國人一貫的豪爽的風度，和他談話，他又具有外交家美好溫雅的詞令，大家都很喜歡他的幽默和風趣。所以當他想回他住的大和旅館時，大家都不放他去，要他和我們同宿在一起。</p>
<p>下午三時，白科長又來了。他送來一封信，我們驚奇，以爲周保中很迅速的給我們寫回信。打開來看，才知道劉其人代周保中邀我們明天去「宴談」。沒有時間，也沒有地址，是一個「怪」的請簡。</p>
<p>隨後，白居仁就向芮克說明劉其人要見他。芮克也願意去見劉其人，因爲他念於要知道：（一）他的飛機，是否安全。（二）是否可以從中共方面弄些汽油。他原想敎世洵一同去，做他的翻譯，但是白居仁沒有同意。他說：「劉將軍那裏可以找到譯員。」可是芮克還是堅持着：「要是譯員沒有話，我要你接趙先生來。」芮克說這句話之前，他先徵詢了世洵的同意。</p>
<p>一刻鐘以後，世洵被一輛吉普帶到了滿炭大樓。這是長春之變後世洵第一次，同時也是最後一次的再進灰大樓。當時的情緒，眞是萬感交集，一言難盡。</p>
<p>世洵走進了從前董彥平的辦公室。一切的陳設，依舊和從前差不多。所不同的，只是走廊裏又擠滿了許多兵，他們走進洗臉間，亂放龍頭的水。這種熱閙的塲面，和董彥平走了以後的行營的淸冷零亂和恐懼的情景，恰巧是個對照。因爲董彥平走後的長春，危急的局面，敏感的中央大員莫不紛紛離長。所謂收復長春，收復長春八十萬的人心，根本是在吹牛，死的，傷的，燒的和損失的，這筆血賬，全掛在老百姓頭上。</p>
<p>芮克要親自上飛機塲去看飛機。劉其人作不定主。他只是狠狠地抽樂羣牌紙烟。樂羣烟在長春土貨中是頂上的烟了。雙方相持了半天，劉其人同意芮克向周保中交涉。</p>
<p>於是白居仁又把我們帶到周保中那裏。那時，他的司令部是在一個小工廠裏。外面一點也看不出是司令部。那所屋子是向宮內府去的那個方向。</p>
<p>周保中同意了芮克少校的要求。轉過身來向世洵說：「趙先生旣是代表無黨無派的報紙，自己又是一個自由主義者，以後我們的談話，比較容易進行了。」</p>
<p>周隨後又說：「你們住在那裏，我對於你們的安全，確實有些不放心。我現在預備好一個旅館，等把芮克少校送回去以後，再送你去那旅館，你現在不要走，至於其他的中美記者，我也決定今天晚上請他們移居。」局說這些話，根本不先徽求世洵個人的同意，也不尊重共黨一向高呼的個人自由權利。世洵沉默下來，肅然的坐在那裏，不表示意見。</p>
<p>芮克不懂周在玩些什麽把戲，要世洵講給他聽。芮克明了世洵的話立刻就向周說：「趙先生是我請他來，帮助你我間的通話。我必有這個義務，要親送他回去。我想他那裏一切起居，十分舒　　　，不是旅館可以趕得上的。」</p>
<p>最後，周問了白科長關我們的安適。他同意芮克的話，這時已是七時，世洵回來，大家追問着經過，才算放心。（未完）</p>

<h3>一灣溪水綠　夾岸荔枝紅　嶺南初夏風光</h3>
<p>— 本報十七日廣州航訊　特派員梁風</p>
<p>當越秀山頭的紅棉落盡，飄絮滿散在天空的時候，這吿訴了南國的人們，夏天經已降臨大地。記者在重慶也曾度過幾個夏天，在那些大陸氣候的地方，實在感到不大好受，這次回到南國，便不禁有迴然不同的感覺；因爲南國的初夏，雖然白天烈日高懸，向着人們强烈照射，但一到了晚上，便和風習習，吹得大地上一片淸凉，將白天的熱氣都消除凈盡的。所以「南國之春」固然可愛，然「嶺南初夏」，實在也有能够吸引人的地方哩！</p>
<h3>日啖荔枝三百顆　願作嶺南人</h3>
<p>現在茘枝·杧果·香蕉·橙子·蘋果·桃子·李子·杏子·仙菱·梨……林林種種，應有盡有，都已陸續的上市了！不過，在這許多水果裏面，能够代表這個季節，而且値得介紹的，應該算是茘枝吧！</p>
<p>關於茘枝的味甘肉腴，在歷史上已有不少人對它讚美的詩句，如杜收詩：「一騎紅塵妃子笑，無人知是茘枝來！」和宋徽宗詩：「玉液乍凝仙堂露，綘苞初結水晶九。」這都可以看見古人好啖茘枝，和對它色美味甘的描寫。白樂天在「茘枝園序」中有說：「殻如紅繪，膜如紫精，　肉瑩白如冰雪，漿液甘如醴酪，若離本枝，一日而色變，二日而香變，三日而味變」。從這裏我們又見到，荔枝是離開樹枝三天便嘗不到眞味的。所以大家都說嶺南茘枝是佳品，大概就是因爲這裏出產較多的緣故；其實，凡是水果都是越新鮮越味美，在沒有出產的地方吃到的茘枝，當然都是從樹上摘下來三天以外的東西，那又怎能比得在這裏吃那麽新鮮呢？這難怪宋詩人蘇東坡也說：「日啖茘枝三百顆，不辭長作嶺南人」了！</p>
<p>當茘枝紅的時候，這裏一個値得介紹的避暑勝地，就是茘枝灣了！那地方是在穗市的西郊，有公共汽車可達，交通還算便利。那個灣是珠江的一條小支流，本來是具有歷史性的昌華故宮舊址，因爲那裏一河兩岸，環境幽美，不少達官貴人，就在那裏建築別墅，於是漸漸便給人發現那裏是個夏天游玩的好所在，有些水上的居民，更造了許多雅緻的畫舫和舢板，使遊客們可以雇舟遊玩，不久，那裏便成爲一個供人夏大遊覽的風景區了。　茘枝灣沒有秦淮河那麽繁華，也沒有西湖那麽幽靜，又沒有玄武湖那麽著名。不過它的好處就是沒有半點人工的渲染，純然是一副天然的面目。它還有一個特色，就是在溪旁兩岸，滿植茘枝樹，每當炎夏，一顆顆鮮紅的荔枝掛在樹上，眞個使人垂涎欲滴，而茘枝灣也就因此得名。從前有人描寫茘枝灣的景色，說是「一灣溪水綠，夾岸茘枝紅，這兩句詩句也可謂描寫得逼眞透澈。</p>
<h3>灣頭兩岸荔枝紅　畫艇月夜多</h3>
<p>在戰前，那裏熱閙極了！在茘灣的兩岸，除了一些紅牆綠瓦的別墅之外，還有不少業餘的組織，什麽音樂社，體育會，跳舞會，俱樂部之類，不一而足。有一個規模較大的就是「西郊游泳塲」那裏每天至少有三千以上的「泳客」。寳舫與舢板，最多的時候有二千餘艘，還有無數的賣鹹酸，賣飯菜，賣艇仔粥，賣優飩麵，賣冰淇淋和那賣唱的小艇，在那裏穿插往來，向遊客兜售。更有數十艘賣酒菜的「紫洞艇」，這是專供達官貴人們宴客之用，這些小艇的陳設備極華麗，是一般陸上的大酒家所不及的。每當華燈初上，便見隊隊的畫舫小舟，有如過江之卿，舶於茘花蔭下，互傾情愫，也有大小一家，帶老携幼，到那裏賞玩茘灣的夜色，也可在吃罷茘枝之餘，一嚐艇仔粥的滋味，或者吃一兩杯冰淇淋，所謂調冰雪藕，其樂怡怡。更有不少靑年男女，在西郊泳塲裏，浮沉江上，有若鴛鴦戲水一般，而達官貴人們則在「紫洞艇」上，舖設華筵，對月舉杯，艇頭買唱，這更是「對酒當歌，人生幾何」的境况</p>
<h3>廿七年荔灣之夏　笙歌夜夜吹</h3>
<p>民國廿七年夏天，可說是茘枝灣的鼎盛時期，那時笙歌夜夜，酒綠燈紅，通宵達旦，眞是不夜之天。可是廣州淪陷之後，那地方便成爲禁地，因爲當時敵人在那裏駐紮軍隊，以監視珠江來往的船隻，而且茘灣的對岸，又時有我們的游擊隊出沒，所以敵人在那裏警衛森嚴，眞是「生人勿近」。</p>
<p>去年廣州光復後，記者曾到過茘枝灣一次，祗是人面桃花，已不復有當年景象。昔日綠瓦紅牆的別墅，變成斷壁頽坦，遊人絕跡，留下七八年前的畫舫，都是「無人舟自橫」，沉默地繫在荔枝樹下，遙望珠江水面，更是一片荒凉，祗堪憑弔而已。</p>
<h3>今年荔灣獲自由　河水比前綠</h3>
<p>今年，這個好像一個在監牢裏度過七年長歲月的茘枝灣，至今已回復它的自由了！看吧！今年茘枝灣的河水似乎比以前更綠，夾岸的茘枝更呈現得更覺鮮紅燦爛。雅緻的遊艇都已陸續的增多，賣食品的小艇也已恢復原狀，西泳游泳塲亦已有人在興工構築中，這一切都顯示茘灣新生的氣象了。朋友們，如果你到廣州而不到茘枝灣遊玩一下，那眞是你的損失哩！</p>

<h3>皖境江上長城　四百萬人生命財產所繫　二百里長無和江堤落成</h3>

<h3>我們需要「文藝通訊」</h3>
<p>— 總雋</p>
<p>近來西洋出版的雜誌裏，盛行一種所謂「新聞雜誌」，我國也有人在要求「新聞雜誌化」。我覺得「新聞雜誌」或「新聞雜誌化」的這些名稱，都不容易使我們看出牠們的性質。大抵說，雜誌裏所刋載的文章，都出以輕鬆的文藝的筆調，把新聞用寫雜誌文章的技巧敘出來，便不同於普通的新聞報導了。</p>
<p>我覺得「文藝通訊」這個名詞，比較恰當。不過「文藝通訊」這個名，有時也可以解釋做報導文藝消息或文壇動態的那類文字。這裏當然是以新聞為主體，為內容，文藝手法的運用，只是技巧上的問題。</p>
<p>文藝是通過人們感情，想像而形象化的，牠能滿足人們內心的強烈要求，是每個人不可缺少的精神補劑，牠能滋潤我勻枯寂的心情，培養人生所亟需要的活力。我們如果要想加強人們對世局的認識，幫助人們了解現實的社會生活，那最有效的方法就是展開「文藝通訊」運動，提倡以文藝的手法報導現階段客觀社會的情況，以及時局中心人物的動態。</p>
<p>一段枯燥的新聞，決沒有一篇生動活潑的文藝通訊來得動人，因為人們在讀「文藝通訊」時，內心已經引起一種強烈的要求，感覺有說不出的愉快，決非普通新聞可比。所以為了完成新聞報導的最高任務，我們就應把「文藝通訊」造成一種普通的風氣而深入社會的各階層。</p>
<p>現在許多人都在要求文藝作家要走現實的路，文藝是現實社會的反映，離開了活現的存在於社會中的「人」和「事」，還有什麼可以表現的？新聞報導的最重要的任務，原在記載活的社會裏的活的「人」和「事」，這也正是文藝作家應該負擔起來的任務，所以有志從事文藝作的人很可在「文藝通訊」方面努力。</p>
<p>好的「文藝通訊」，又可供給作家豐富的題材，使他們通過感情和想像的創作，更能接近現實，更能表現出這個活的社會裏的活的「人」和「事」。作者如能用訪問新聞的精密的觀察去刻劃現實的人生，一定可以產生有血有肉的作品。照這樣看，文藝通訊不但可以給文藝作者做參考，同時作者也可以經過這一番訓練而加深寫作的素養。</p>
<p>我們希望新聞界和雜誌界提倡今日大多數人所需要的「文藝通訊」</p>

<h3>第二次世界大戰史</h3>
<p>— 王次青</p>
<p>作者：儲玉坤　出版：永祥印書館</p>
<p>我國著作界對於世界史的著作，向來依賴外國人的著作，所謂著作，不過編譯而已。完全憑自己的眼光，把世界各國的史料編著成為一本史書的，簡直是鳳毛麟角，我國出版界所印行的幾本西洋通史的第一次世界大戰史暨西洋近代史等等，各有藍本。從這一點看起來，也可以知道我國著作界的幼稚。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰史的作者儲玉坤從一九三九年九月一日開始，一直到一九四五年八月十五日為止，在這整整的六年之間，隨時採集資料，把研究所得寫出來，六年如一日，從未終斷。的確化了許多心血和腦汗。據作者在序文裏說：這本書的原稿，曾經蒙過難，在日本憲兵隊裏逕留了一個多月之久，始隨勝利的來到，而獲得解放。今日能見到這本書的出版，格外覺得珍貴。</p>
<p>看完了這本近三十萬字的世著，覺得有幾個特點，值得介紹與讀者諸君。</p>
<p>第一，作者的文筆，流暢生動，敘述大戰的經過，雖極詳細，但不覺得沉悶。</p>
<p>第二，內容充實，把大戰的經過，源源本本的敘述出來，沒有遺　，可供研究國際問題的參攷。</p>
<p>第三，我們談歷史，最注意的是前因後果，作者憑其研究國際問題的眼光，分析戰局及各國勝敗及得失甚詳，可以當作一部現代史讀。</p>
<p>第四，全書除了三十萬字以外，還有六十餘幅的照片與插圖，使內容更加生色不少。</p>
<p>但是這本書也有它的缺點，我們特別要指出，希望作者至再版時，加以修正。第一是錯字太多，大概是校對不力之故。第二是史料偏於歐洲的部分，而對於中日戰爭暨太平洋戰爭，反而略而不詳，作者雖在序文中說明他的理由，但我們仍希望他能接受我們的批評，而於再版時修正並加補充，俾能成為一部完善的史書。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於作者化了五六年心血時間才寫成的著作，應該予以愛護與獎勵，否則作家的收積實在太苦了。無論如何，這本書是現代中國出版界的一部巨著，值得向讀者推　的。</p>
<h3>介紹一本扼要·淺顯·通俗的　西洋哲學史</h3>
<p>— 思牧</p>
<p>著者：李長之</p>
<p>出版處：正中書局</p>
<p>出版期：三十四年十一月</p>
<p>以前所讀過的關於西洋哲學史的著作，不下十餘種，其中譯本佔大半，原來就很枯燥乏味的材料，加上生硬的譯筆，誰讀了都會感到沈悶，有些著述，又過於偏重一面，不能融會西洋哲學思想之史的發展的全部，使我們無法窺探到西洋思想史進展的軌跡，同時又因為那些書本儒巾氣太重，現代人對於那種經院派的書籍，自然不容易感到興趣。</p>
<p>我常想：為什麼沒有一本比較明顯扼要而適合於一般人閱讀的西洋哲學史呢？直到現在我才發現一本合於理想的西洋哲學史，那就是李長之光生著的「西洋哲學史」。我覺得這本書寫得很精要，沒有煩言冗語，而能以客觀的態度給西洋哲學史刻劃出一個輪廓。讀了這本書，我們可以得着一個明顯的概念，由這個概念引導我們進一步登入西洋哲學思想的堂　。</p>
<h3>西洋雜誌近訊</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>美國在戰爭期間，新出的「讀者文摘」型雜誌為數不少，計有Reader's　Scope，Read，Fact，Digest　&amp;Review等數種，其中除第一種在上海的書攤中時時可遇見外，其餘各種尙未在上海露面。</p>
<p>新出的書報有See一種，與Look遙遙相對。</p>
<p>新出的通俗科學雜講誌之名稱是Science　Iuvstrated据說圖照頗為　當。</p>
<p>Life書報原版上注明，「非軍人訂戶須於接得訂單三個月後方可開始寄發」。在上海委託書店代訂該書報原版的讀者務請注意。</p>
<p>據美國書報公司最近來函，一般暢銷的通俗雜誌，仍無法大置購得。這是由於紙張缺乏，抑是為了大量供應軍用的關係，則不得而知。</p>
<p>星期六郵報公司新出之Holiday月刋一種，聞內容頗為精采。</p>
<p>英國戰前之雜誌，現在大都繼續出版，但由於紙張配給的缺乏，其篇幅均薄得可憐。如Times　Literary　Supplement，Johno'London's　Weekly，Answers等都只有從前三分之一的篇幅。</p>

<h3>真正巨型刊物</h3>
<p>— 周馥</p>
<p>「求真雜誌」</p>
<p>有許多雜誌都自命為「巨型」，而按其實際，不過表面上好像巨型而已，去真正的巨型很遠。入開的書報，不是真正的巨型，十六開的任何雜誌，如果只有一二張紙的篇幅，連形式上的巨型也不夠。此外，如果十六開，或任何幾開，能夠用到四五張紙，形式上巨型，也許可勉強過去，可是其內容是否可當巨型而無愧色，却又成了問題。在現在，幾百種雜誌中，比較了牠們的外形與內容，我不能不說，五月一日出版的「求真雜誌」，是真正的巨型刋物！</p>
<p>當然，一個刋物的內容，比了外形尤其重要，所以我們不妨看看「求真」的內容，空間牠的「巨」在那裏。</p>
<p>一般地說，這裏面幾十篇文章，各有各的特點，決不會有時下的不良習氣，歪曲宣傳，出賣噱頭，淺薄無聊剽　抄襲浪費了印刷物料還與人以毒害。舉例地說，則下列幾篇尤其值得我們的細讀：</p>
<p>「論五四運動之劃時代的意義」，在紀念五四運動的各種文章中，可以說是最詳細，最到家，最論斷確當的一篇。「古史辨的解毒劑」，是我國學術史上或思想史上，一定有其輝煌的地位。牠敢於向勢力雄厚的「古史辨」挑戰，牠的胆氣是大的，而牠的武器尤其是精銳的。「老子的哲學及其社會思想，」融古於今，以今證古，決非腹儉的人所能寫得出。……</p>
<p>在發刋詞「創辦宗旨」中，他們提出了這樣的口號：「勇敢地追求真理！堅定地擁護真理！但同時也要勇敢地在真理面前低頭！」看了牠的內容，這口號的確是實踐了。</p>
<p>這樣的刋物，照理是應該受讀者的歡迎的，正如戰前讀者歡迎「東方雜誌」或「申報月刋」一樣。但正當不良刋物充斥文化市場的今天，牠的銷路能否如理想的美滿，却不能不使人担心。我們的讀者。究竟到了什麼地步，我想正可以將牠，求真雜誌，來作一個試金石。</p>
<h3>美國暢銷書的故事</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>關於美國的暢銷書，最有趣的是陶格拉斯（Lloyd　C.Douglas）所寫的那部「神衣」出版袋兩年，已銷去一百五十四萬五千本，出版公司忙着買紙添印，讓者蜂擁着訂購，添印的不夠，仍缺三四萬本。</p>
<p>但講到這本暢銷書的本身，批評家都以為「毫無文學價值，」它的銷路之盛，近幾年來，在美國一班書中，堪稱無出其右。在美國所有暢銷書中，銷數佔第五位，好萊塢的影片公司，有的願出十萬美金，購買「神衣」的製片權，後來另幾家影片公司，雖願出美金一百萬去轉買，都遭拒絕。電影公司都拿得很穩，「神衣」攝成影片後，一定是轟動影壇，保險可以大賺一筆錢。</p>
<p>講到文學上的成就，無論和那一本世界傑作比較，「神衣」都是一本失敗的作品。但是，假使平均每本「神衣」有五個人閱看的話，那末美國人閱看該書的，至少有六百萬人，你說少數人的眼光不成可以，你總不能說六百萬人的眼光都不成，趣味都低級。並且在一班讀者中，大多數的人都說給人感動刺激，看後使人滿意。</p>
<p>所以有人以為：要成為一本　銷書，當備具兩個特點：書內的寓意非常崇高，全寫法十分庸俗，一本書具有這兩種特點，一定是　到大多數人歡迎的。</p>
<p>讀到作者怎樣開始寫「神衣」，就是一件很有趣的故事，原來陶格拉斯有一天去一家百貨公司買東西，和一個女店員閒談，女店員講到耶穌殉難時身上着的那件衣服，被羅馬的衛兵剝下來，大家擲骰子賭輸　，問陶格拉斯可破顏微笑張來那件衣服的下落空間怎樣。陶格拉斯當然也不知道，但他聽到這話後，忽然憶及，這題材可以用來寫本小說，於是他去後，遂開始寫將起來。想不到，女店員在無意中，竟供給了陶格拉斯一部暢銷書的材料。</p>
<p>在美國的書業中，銷數最大的是學校中的教科書。譬如韋白斯脫（Noah　Webster）的拼音讀本，從出版後迄今，這幾十年中，已銷去一萬萬本以上，無論是甚麼暢銷的小說，當然都比它不上。</p>
<p>美國從前，小說是沒有銷到一百萬本的，直到一八五二年，史韜夫人（Harriet　Beecher　Stowe）的黑奴　大錄（“Uncle　Tom's　Cabin”）出版後，才打破了百萬本的記錄。此後數年中，沒有及得上黑奴　大錄銷路暢的小說，及至一八七五年，才又有一本暢銷小說應世，那是馬克吐溫（Mark　Twain）的「頑童歷險記」（“TomSawyer”），出版後銷去一百五十萬本，並且銷路歷久，至今不衰。</p>
<p>象馬克吐溫的頑童歷險記，暢銷歷久不衰，在暢銷書中也是少見的，美國普通一班暢銷書，祇出版後短短數年中，銷路暢旺，稍過數年便已沒沒無聞。譬如，美國　有暢銷書，銷路　大約是　　　（　　　　　　　　　　　Sheldon）的「亦步亦趨」（“In　His　Steps”），現在普通一班讀者已早給忘掉，偶爾有人買一兩本看看，也不過是研究文學的人好奇罷了。「亦步亦趨」出版於一八九九年，確切的銷數沒有人知道，因為它的版權制不大完善，除了原來一家出版公司，後來共有十六家出版公司添印該書，估計該書一其至少當銷去八百萬本。</p>
<p>銷數佔二位，是卜特爾（Gen　Sttatton　Porter）的「斑痕」（“Freckles”），該書於一九〇四年出版，共銷去二百萬本以上。第三本暢銷書是華萊斯（Lew　Wallace）的「賓漢」（“Ben　hur”），一八八〇年出版，一共也差不多銷到二百萬本。第四本暢銷書是「林白落的姑娘」（“A　Girl　of　The　Limberlost”）也是卜特爾寫的，出版於一九〇九年，一共銷去一百六十萬本。第五本暢銷書就是上面講到的那本「神衣」，至於佔第六位的暢銷書，共有兩本，一本是賴特（Harold　Bell　Worth）的「巴巴娜·華爾斯」（“The　Winning　of　Barbara　Worth”）（出版於一九一一年，另一本則係密奚爾）（Margaret　Mitchell）的「隨風而逝」（“Gone　with　the　Wino”），「巴巴娜·華爾斯」共銷去一百五十萬本，「隨風而逝」，因為後來又改攝電影劇本，確實的銷數不詳，但大約和「巴巴娜·華爾斯」的銷數相若。</p>
<p>此地有一點值得我們注意的就是，在以上所述的六本暢消書中，　有三本都含有讓　的　　意味。「亦步亦趨」，「賓漢」同「神衣」，宗教氣味都很濃。這並不是說，無論甚麼小說，祇要迎合讀者心理，加上一些宗教色彩，便可以成功暢銷書，但是根據美國書賣的經騐，小說內若能採取宗教題材，對銷路的確有點幫助。</p>
<p>時代的特殊情形，也影響一本書的銷路。譬如「神衣」出版時，美國人民正過到戰事爆發，粉碎了和平的迷夢，在悲愁失望中，心靈上正需要一種安慰，而「神衣」一書，正抓住了這一點，給讀者減去不少內心的苦痛，因此獲得大眾的歡迎。這一點很和賽珍珠的「大地」類似。「大地」出版時，正值美國民眾希望暗淡，彷徨疑懼，對未來抱着杌不安的態度，正需要一種鼓勵，一種安慰，而賽珍珠的「大地」以簡樸的中國農民為題材，描寫中國農民那種堅忍奮發的精神，憑着勤儉苦幹，終不忍離開自家的鄉土，使美國當時的民眾看了，也興奮鼓舞起來。</p>
<p>再說「神衣」的作者陶格拉斯，以前已有好多本著名的作品，銷路都很好，不過比不上「神衣，罷了。最初是一九三二年春所出版的「覆人情思」“The　Magnincent　Obsession”，列為該年暢銷書之一，開始引起書賣出版商的注意。因再版五十次，銷去了七十萬本。在英國加拿大等地，銷路都好，並譯成好幾種外國文字。</p>
<p>「情思擾人」乃是陶格拉斯的第一本小說，講到作者開始寫　　的情形，也和「神衣」一樣，也是一件很有趣的故事。陶格拉斯是寫來講道用的，每星期做禮拜時，不像普通牧師那樣講道，他每次讀一段小說給大家聽，結果這牧師小說家不但使聽道的感到興趣，積時累月，也寫好這本著名的小說。繼「寬恕」“Forgive　Us　Ou　r　Trespasses”「危機莫失」“Precious　Jeopardy”「綠光」“Green　Light”「白旗」“White　Banners”「爭點」“Disputed　Passage”「聖誕節的家」“Home　for　Christmsa”「赫德遜博士的收秘密日記」“Dr.　Huson's　Secret　Journal”「生之邀請」“Invitation　to　Live”以及「神衣」等。此後陶格拉斯才又根據彼得的生世，寫一本小說，即用「大漁人」“　The　Big　Fisherman”為題目。</p>
<p>看看看陶格拉斯談到他寫作的經騐。也許，在這種地方，我們可以悟到一點美國暢銷書成功的秘廖。</p>
<p>陶格拉斯曾說，「在我的小說，，我祇將我的思想，將我要對聽眾說的話，給寫了下來，我假設我的聽眾對於基督教完全不明白是怎麼一回事，而我要設法去講釋給他們聽，我用簡明的語句，藉生動的故事，喩說信奉基督教的生活的樂趣。」</p>
<p>有人說，假若陶格拉斯的小說寫得再好一些，不曾有這麼多讀者去看它；假若陶格拉斯的小說寫得再壞一些，也不曾有這麼多讀者要看它。」這兩句批評美國暢銷書的話，說得倒是很中　的。</p>

<h3>Bowles Arrives in Beijing from Korea Yesterday to Investigate the Allocation of Northeast Japanese Assets and Reparations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Mr. Bowles, advisor to President Truman on reparations, and his party of five, arrived in Beijing this morning at 10:00 AM via special plane from Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Truman's reparations commissioner, Bowles, arrived in Nanjing from Seoul today. While greeting reporters, he stated that after consulting with Special Envoy Marshall and Premier Song Ziwen, he would establish an office in Lianyungang to investigate the production of heavy materials and products in the nine provinces, to assist with the industrial recovery of the Far East. A reporter asked: What action will be taken regarding the removal of machines from the Northeast? He replied: The main purpose of establishing an office in the Northeast and going to the Soviet-occupied zone in northern Korea is to investigate Japanese assets abroad and see if they have been removed by anyone. This matter certainly cannot escape our notice. The Shenyang office will be established by Bowles' aide, Colonel Mayes. Mr. Bowles will go to Beiping tomorrow to consult with the Sino-American military authorities. An office is also planned to be established in Korea. Bowles will travel between the two locations and expects to complete his mission in less than a month. Regarding the Soviet removal of military industrial equipment, it is said that he does not wish to express any opinions before going to the Northeast to ascertain the facts. Bowles is scheduled to fly from Beiping to Shanghai on the 26th, return to Korea on the 27th, and then go to the Soviet-occupied zone in northern Korea again on the 28th. It is expected that it will take one month at most, and half a month at least, to complete the work in both places. Bowles admitted that the detailed plan for the investigation in North Korea has not yet been finalized. As for whether Bowles will go to the Communist-held areas in the Northeast, he will ask Special Envoy Marshall to negotiate on his behalf, depending on the outcome. The Nationalist forces have agreed to provide all kinds of conveniences. Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, Bowles said that the percentage each country should receive has not yet been determined, but the second step after the investigation will be to decide on this matter. China can expect to receive a majority of the machinery and equipment, which may include former military aircraft, metals, steel, chemicals, and any equipment using machine tools.</p>
<h3>Equipment from Japanese Naval Shipyards Decided to be Included in the Reparations List. Far Eastern Commission Passes Resolution Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] The Far Eastern Commission unanimously passed a resolution today to include all equipment from Japanese naval shipyards in the reparations list, and to limit the tonnage of future Japanese merchant ships. The Far Eastern Commission, responsible for drafting temporary plans for the transfer of Japanese reparations materials, has announced guidelines for the disposition of two other industries (sulfuric acid and machine tools). All equipment from public and private naval shipyards will be allocated as reparations materials for shipment. Machinery in military shipyards will be sealed pending future arrangements. Japan will be allowed to retain shipbuilding equipment to build 150,000 tons of merchant ships per year, and to service a total of 3 million tons of merchant ships (including repairs). The Far Eastern Commission's plan also stipulates that Japan may retain two docks of 20,000 tons each to service foreign ships. The Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, told reporters that the policy announced by Japan is based on the recommendations made by Bowles in his interim report. Measures regarding the external disposition of other industries will be announced later.</p>

<h3>Chairman Instructs on Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Grain prices in Jiangsu Province are soaring, and the people are struggling to survive. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek attaches great importance to this.

Otherwise, it should be sold at a fixed price to regulate supply. (2) Those who hoard and manipulate prices should be punished severely in accordance with the law, without leniency. (3) Local authorities often use the excuse of insufficient food supply to prohibit exports, which is inappropriate. They should be clearly instructed not to obstruct. (4) Military grain is a real need. Merchants and civilians should be considerate of the government and comply. The government should also launch public opinion to assist in the effort. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Yu has forwarded it to all counties for strict compliance.</p>

On the afternoon of the 22nd, Communist representative Fang and Zeng Sheng of the Eighth Group paid a visit to Director Zhang of the Executive Headquarters. Fang expressed his admiration and thanked Director Zhang for the preferential treatment and assistance to the Communist personnel. On the eve of their departure, Director Zhang instructed Zeng Sheng that if there were any difficulties in implementing the agreement, he could ask for help again. The various liaison groups are scheduled to leave here on the 25th, which is the first day of the one-month period agreed upon. The Communist representatives stated that they were extremely grateful for the assistance from the Executive Headquarters and the American side, and for Director Zhang's repeated assurances of the safe northward transfer of the Communist forces.

<h3>Guangdong Executive Headquarters Borrows a Large Sum of Money to Cover the Costs of Transferring Communist Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 23rd] Today, the Eighth Group of the Military Mediation Department held its first formal reception for reporters after arriving in Guangdong.

He also presented four anti-Japanese plans drafted by Commander Li Mingyang, intending to revolt and respond when the Allied forces landed, and an telegram from Zhu Gongjian, the current Civil Affairs Director of Jiangsu Province. The court adjourned the hearing and Zhang was returned to custody.</p>

The purchase was assigned to the village chiefs at a price of 600 yuan per dan. According to market prices, each dan resulted in a loss of more than 1,000 yuan. Because the township was slow in delivering the firewood, the troops broke the head of the township head, Lu Heqin, with weapons. Zhu Heming, the third village chief, was also injured. Township Head Lu reported to the county government, which sent a team to arrest Liu Jinfu and another person involved in the assault and send them to the special commissioner for disposition. Lu went to the hospital for treatment. The township head stated that when he and others were beaten, all the desks, documents, and household registration books in the township office were destroyed.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hurry Up and Voluntarily Expand Thrift!</h3>
<p>In the recent issue of the American magazine "Time," under the heading "Ladies' Champagne and Silk," there is the following record: "The headline of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post: Famine is becoming more serious, and thirty million people in China are facing starvation. Under a cloudy sky, eighty guests sat in comfortable armchairs waiting for Mrs. Carine's first postwar fashion show. Gathered on Mrs. Carine's spacious and soft lawn were the flamboyant figures of Shanghai's international society. The wife of an American oil company executive arrogantly walked in wearing a new spring outfit, and an icy Russian young woman sat like a Raphael Madonna wearing a striking blue turban. Half of the guests were Chinese, all gorgeously dressed. In the bygone era of extraterritoriality, they had never been invited to Mrs. Carine's fashion salon; but now Mrs. Carine's customers are 'a group of prominent Chinese.' Mrs. Carine said, 'They are very, very rich, very, very extravagant people.' The foreign ladies, very carefully, sat apart, indifferently welcoming this new era. The Great American Evening Post said that about four million people hardly get any relief and fear they will not survive this unprecedented disaster...'" This is an extremely interesting and, in the eyes of us Chinese, a very shameful account. Under the famine disaster raging in various parts of China, Mrs. Carine served champagne to the ladies present, and more than half of them were Chinese ladies, watching Mrs. Carine enthusiastically unfold the scene of her fashion show; what a satire this is on China!</p>
<p>According to another news report, according to unofficial figures released by the customs authorities, in January of this year, the total value of goods imported into this city was 9.38286432 billion legal tender, which increased to 15.17332728 billion yuan in February, and further increased to 44.20843432 billion yuan in March; on the export side, it was 5.64181394 billion yuan in January, and the import-export difference in that month was less than one time. In February, the value of exports decreased to 3.30896433 billion yuan, and imports exceeded exports by nearly three times. Exports increased slightly in March, amounting to 4.46257159 billion yuan, but they still did not catch up with the export amount in January, and the distance from the import value in the same month was even greater, with a difference of nearly ten times. In other words, the ratio of imports to exports in March was ten to one. Although the figures for April and May have not yet been announced, it is expected that the current imbalance in China's international balance of payments will be even more serious than before. According to bankers: Taking the Bank of China as an example, the daily settlement of US dollars is about 100,000 yuan or more. Except for a small amount of chemical raw materials and American cotton, most of the imported goods are "glass wallets" and the like; at the same time, almost no one cares about exporting. We do not know what the government authorities think after reading this report. Has their policy of stifling production reaped such serious consequences, and should they bear the responsibility? We don't even know if the ladies, after reading this report, feel a slight twinge of pain in their hearts when rushing to buy "glass wallets" and the like?</p>
<p>What a serious and painful picture the customs report paints! The ratio of imports to exports is ten to one, and this situation will become more and more serious. "Living off one's reserves" - what a crisis threatening the survival of our nation! Under this economic crisis, under the nationwide famine, the prominent Chinese ladies in Shanghai are in the mood to sit comfortably on Mrs. Carine's lawn, drinking champagne, appreciating the new clothes made by this Russian lady, scrambling to buy the spring clothes made by this lady at the cost of thousands of US dollars; while hundreds of thousands, even countless, victims in various parts of China are dying of starvation. We are appealing for overseas relief, but the prominent ladies are drinking champagne. This passage in "Time" magazine makes every Chinese person ashamed to death. Really, every Chinese person must rise up to curb this decadent trend, to preserve some integrity for our country and nation. This is the duty of every Chinese person. Facing the current economic crisis, serious famine, and decadent trend of extravagance and debauchery, we call on the people of the whole country to voluntarily practice thrift and overcome the current difficulties with austerity. We cannot allow this trend of luxury and waste to continue!</p>
<p>It is only for these reasons that we have written articles calling on everyone to practice thrift and hoping that the people will consciously and voluntarily rise up to practice thrift. Since we shouted the slogan "Let everyone practice thrift," we have seen the arrival of the new mayor. At the beginning of his tenure, this new mayor hoped that citizens would voluntarily save. At the welcome banquet of the Hubei Fellow Villagers Association, Mayor Wu expressed three points, one of which was to hope that citizens would unanimously promote the thrift movement. However, some people think that the small matter of thrift cannot remedy Shanghai's municipal administration, and some people even think that Shanghai is an international city, and social occasions cannot be too shabby, so it should not advocate thrift at all. These insane people are almost soulless! We once said: "If the thrift movement is to succeed, it does not lie in the strict control of the government, but in the voluntary compliance of the people... it all depends on the people being able to consciously and voluntarily rise up to be thrifty... Rather than the government formulating prohibitions, it is better for all sectors of society to voluntarily formulate three chapters of the law and abide by them mutually... We want to encourage everyone to compete in thrift, and correct the vain concept of competing in extravagance." We feel regret that the mayor's advice and our appeals have not seen any response so far, and all sectors of Shanghai society have not yet voluntarily started to practice thrift. Does this indicate the numbness of Shanghai people? Definitely not. There are many people in Shanghai who understand righteousness and fear being behind others in loving the country. This thrift movement is to correct the decadent trend of competing in extravagance, so as to preserve some vitality for the country and the nation. No one in Shanghai should be unwilling to voluntarily promote it. However, the fact that the citizens' thrift movement has not been promoted and unfolded is a fact, and we cannot continue to procrastinate. We must quickly and voluntarily launch a city-wide thrift movement. Waiting for the government to issue prohibitions and then promote thrift will ultimately be a disgrace to the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Citizens of Shanghai! Shanghai is the number one city in the country. We must set an example for the national thrift movement. We should quickly and voluntarily rise up to promote this movement. Citizen leaders should take the lead in advocating it and mobilize all communities and strata to promote this thrift movement. We must live up to the expectations of this new mayor for us!</p>

<h3>National Train Transportation Halted, American Railway Workers Go on General Strike, Government Immediately Manages Other Transportation Tools, Truman Convenes Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd, United Press] The railway strike conference held at the White House ended in failure after eight hours of discussion. The strike leaders still ignored President Truman's proposed solution. President Truman's labor problem Steilman said: He hoped the strike could be resolved tomorrow, but both labor and management said that the meeting made no progress. Only a few trains were running across the United States tonight, and the drivers were all non-union members. Thousands of passengers were stranded in various railway stations, and the food problem threatened major factories. Various industries were seen to be shutting down, and all commerce was also suspended.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Workers on 337 American railway lines have indeed begun a general strike at 9:00 tonight (6:00 AM, Shanghai Summer Time, 24th). At the same time, President Truman held emergency consultations with representatives from both labor and management at the White House to seek a solution. The White House did not announce any decision when 250,000 members of the two railway worker unions began the strike. Several hours before the strike began, major railway lines had already begun canceling services, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded en route. In New York, many passengers boarded the last train, climbing through the windows into the passenger cars. Almost 6,000 people rushed to catch the train at New York Central Station, with those boarding and those disembarking jammed together in extreme disorder. The trains on Long Island, which carry 250,000 workers back and forth to work every day, were also canceled before the strike began, and tens of thousands of workers were stranded in New York City. The government immediately managed transportation tools other than railways to transport food and mail. All trucks, buses, airplanes, ships, and railways that continued to operate were ordered by the government to use their equipment to ensure passenger and freight transport to the greatest extent. Except for emergency supplies, all freight transport has been prohibited. The wave of 100,000 railway workers began in July last year, when twenty unions demanded a wage increase of up to two dollars and fifty cents per day. Eighteen unions agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, but the two unions of drivers and conductors, with a total of 250,000 members, advocated a strike on May 18. The strike order was canceled at the last minute due to the establishment of a five-day truce agreement, but the eastern railways were already in chaos before officially receiving the suspension of the strike. A chaotic scene at railway stations in major cities, with thousands of passengers rushing to catch the last train, turning back due to the early cancellation of services, and wartime carpooling quickly resumed between towns.</p>
<p>In addition, according to mining spokespersons, coal mines have had to suspend operations within 24 hours due to a lack of vehicles. Of the 4,500 bituminous coal mines, 90% of those that use railway transportation are affected by the strike.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The White House held another meeting today to discuss new contract terms to completely resolve the miner strikes.</p>

<h3>Spanish Troops Total 840,000</h3>
<p>Report by the Prime Minister of the Republican Government</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 23rd] The Subcommittee on the Spanish Question of the United Nations Security Council held a meeting today, and the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Mr. Quiwell, attended the meeting to present his views. The Chairman, Australian representative Mr. Hasluck, asked Mr. Quiwell: Regarding the memorandum stating that the Spanish army has a total of 840,000 officers and men, excluding the police, the internal guard, and the Falange. Are the Spanish Navy and Air Force included? Mr. Li immediately replied "Yes". Brazilian representative Mr. Savero Guanaqi asked: What is the total number of the Spanish Army, Navy, and Air Force? Mr. Ki replied: Because the internal guard and police are constantly changing, it is difficult to determine the total number. Taking the Falange as an example, there are 500,000 people. In addition, there are other troops, such as the Carabinieri and border guards, all of which are under the command of the Army General Staff. Not only that, Franco recently ordered the people to be allowed to carry firearms, making it even more impossible to count.</p>

<h3>Japanese Emperor's Second Broadcast Makes an Urgent Appeal for the Food Problem</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan made his second broadcast speech to the nation at noon today with a high-pitched and gentle tone, lasting ten minutes. His words were as follows: The revival of the country should first seek the stability of the people's lives, and food is especially important. During and after the war, amazing results have been achieved in the production and transportation of food. Although they have worked hard, the food panic in various parts of the country has become even more serious and unprecedented. This situation is particularly severe in major cities, which is worrying. In order to solve the current situation, the government has taken urgent measures, which goes without saying. At the same time, the people of Japan should also be prepared to endure hardship, help each other, and overcome difficulties. Japan has suffered from war and the scars are still there, and I cannot bear to ask the people to fast and suffer again. But without this, all our postwar efforts will be wasted. And our great and sacred work of rebuilding a peaceful and civilized country and helping to promote world progress will not be realized. I hope that the people of the whole country can abide by the excellent traditional spirit of the Japanese family and nation, abandon personal interests, overcome the current crisis, and move towards the path of revival and nation-building.</p>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 24th) The Emperor's speech was pre-recorded in the palace yesterday and broadcast three times today at noon, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Royal Family Member Wants to Be a Chauffeur</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] After MacArthur ordered the stripping of the privileges of the Japanese royal family yesterday, reporters visited Prince Kayo no Miya Tsunenori, a former lieutenant general in the army, to ask about his new life in the future. He replied that he has always advocated a simple life. After his private residence was subjected to a military coup last March, he rented eight rooms from the Hiroike family to live in. There were no guards, and only four or five scholars lived with him. Therefore, he does not feel bitter about how this order will affect him. He also said that he often drove a car during his time in the army. This April, he applied to the police station for a driver's license, so he will be helpful in making a living when necessary. However, employment is related to the imperial family and the imperial regulations, and because he was a soldier in the past, it will be very difficult. Currently, he needs about 10,000 yuan per month for expenses. In addition to reducing servants, he also needs to consider fundamental countermeasures. In short, he will abide by the principle that those who do not work shall not eat and live the same life as the people.</p>
<h3>Five-Power Chiefs of Staff Meeting Discusses Forming International Army, Chairman Denies Meeting is Deadlocked</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: Chairman Van Lin of the United Nations Post-War Staff Committee denied today that the Five-Power Chiefs of Staff meeting was deadlocked. It is said that the representatives of the five powers have completely consistent opinions on maintaining world peace and said that the representatives are discussing the technical issues of organizing an international army. Van Lin emphasized that the strength of this international army is strong enough to prevent any job disputes.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: The Five-Power Military Chiefs of Staff Meeting, held in New York, has been going on for two months without results. The biggest reason is the Soviet Union's non-cooperation. Meetings have been held every day in the past two months and have been kept secret. Although it is impossible to know who the chairman of each meeting is, there is actually no need to keep it secret, because what is being discussed is still limited to procedural issues. As for the armed forces that the Security Council should have, they have not yet been discussed. According to the Soviet representative, he did not receive instructions from the government when he left the Soviet Union, and so far, he has not received instructions from the government.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders the Japanese Government to Freeze the Assets of War Criminals</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese government, in accordance with MacArthur's instructions, will announce the Specific Property Management Order and Specific Property Management Rules tomorrow, and will freeze the property of war criminals from today onwards. That is, according to the order of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, the property of war criminals who are currently or will be arrested and imprisoned, except for maintaining the daily life of their families, will be frozen by the tax office. In addition, this measure is aimed at preserving the evidence of war criminals, so the property of the family, not to mention the property of the person, will not be confiscated. Once acquitted, the freeze will be lifted. Even if convicted, if the person did not obtain the property by improper means, the ownership will not be seized.</p>
<h3>King of Transjordan Ascends the Throne Today</h3>

The mission of the American troops stationed in Italian territory is to protect the transportation lines of the American occupation forces in Austria.

Then he talked about other questions, but he often said: "The questions you asked are too complicated, I am sorry I cannot answer." When a reporter from Time magazine asked about the demonstration by 250,000 Japanese people last Sunday, demanding the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet, Yoshida stood up angrily and said: There are other important matters to be dealt with. Some reporters asked to extend the time for a few minutes so that they could ask some important questions. Yoshida said: The interview time I gave you is only 25 minutes.

<h3>The Holy See Promotes the Catholic System in Our Country</h3>
<p>Dividing into Twenty Dioceses</p>
<p>The Representative to China is also Promoted in Rank</p>

<h3>America Invents Germ Weapon with Greater Power than Atomic Bomb Capable of Destroying All Life in Major Cities</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] It is rumored that America's most secret weapon is a germ that can wipe out major cities and grains in one fell swoop, "its harm far exceeding that of the atomic bomb." Staff member Thomas mentioned this new weapon for the first time in the Senate yesterday, without going into details. Members of the House Appropriations Committee recently revealed the nature of the new weapon to the press, and briefly described its power as above. It was also said that the full details of the germ weapon can be known when the Appropriations Committee listens to the report on the $463,718,000 Navy expenditure plan. A certain member stated: Several types of germ weapons have already been developed to the stage where they can be used at any time if necessary. Only the United States knows the secret of this weapon, and its power can wipe out all life in major cities. When used, it is spread by aircraft, and the aircraft can be in the air without being threatened by ground artillery fire. Once the germs are spread, living things are quickly infected and there is no hope of survival. Although the detailed facts are not yet known, it is quite certain that the germ is highly contagious and can probably be spread by bombs. Another type of germ weapon can wipe out five grains in one fell swoop, and even the seeds in the soil will not grow again. "Perhaps mankind has not yet understood that there will be no victor in future wars unless we can forever prevent war, otherwise human civilization will be destroyed." According to reports, the US Navy recently disclosed that it has been engaged in germ warfare research at the University of California, and is currently studying a disease that has "hundreds of years of history and is extremely deadly." Various parties speculate that this statement refers to the Black Death.</p>
<h3>International Aviation Conference Issues "Aviation Freedom" Proposal to be Called Convention on Commercial Rights of Civil Aviation Transport</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Montreal, 23rd] The first congress of the Provisional International Air Transport Organization today issued a proposal for "general exchange" and "five freedoms of the air," but it is feared that strong opposition will be encountered if it is desired to pass it as soon as possible. The proposed proposal is called the "Convention on Commercial Rights of Civil Aviation Transport," which stipulates the following five freedoms of the air: (1) Freedom to fly over foreign countries without landing, (2) Freedom to land in foreign countries without loading or unloading passengers or cargo, (3) (4) Freedom to carry domestic passengers and cargo when flying abroad or flying domestically, (5) Freedom to carry passengers and cargo from Country A to Country B, the last item being the "Fifth Freedom" over which disputes arise. The committee proposed the establishment of an International Civil Aviation Transport Committee to interpret and implement this agreement, and to have the power to order a country to correct its actions in order to resolve disputes. According to unofficial sources, the United States is not eager to accept this convention at this meeting, and would rather wait for the overall world situation to become more stable before discussing it again.</p>

<h3>Scientists from Various Countries Gather in the United States to Study Atomic Energy Three Institutions Established at the University of Chicago, Including Ge Tingrui from Our Country</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 22nd] Many scientists who have participated in atomic bomb research are now stepping up their efforts in peaceful projects, in order to have a clearer understanding of atomic energy, and not to aim at manufacturing rockets for travel to the moon. These scientists are now concentrating their talents on three newly established organizations at the University of Chicago, namely (1) the Institute for Nuclear Studies, (2) the Institute for Radiobiology and Biophysics, and (3) the Institute for Metals. Most of the researchers participated in wartime work, and came from Chicago and other universities, and there are also scientists from Norway, Poland, China, Britain, Italy, Germany and Hungary participating in it. According to Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, this kind of organization will give the university a superior position in nuclear research.</p>
<p>Metallurgists, physicists and theoretical chemists, using the technology developed during the war, are formulating plans to determine the properties of metals at temperatures ranging from four hundred and fifty-nine degrees below zero to over five thousand degrees. Smith, from the University of Birmingham, England, was the leader of the group at the Los Alamos atomic bomb laboratory. His colleagues include Chersel-Eliason, who taught at the University of Oslo, Norway, and Skapski, who taught at Jagiellonian University and served as a consultant to the Polish steel industry. Ge Tingrui from Yenching University in China is also one of them.</p>
<p>The Research Institute only has a temporary site, and its new building is expected to cost $2 million, and the annual expenditure can be increased to $2.3 million.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Eastman Kodak Company today released a report on the results of the company and other experts' research on the atomic bomb test conducted last year in New Mexico: The test results showed that the radioactive by-products of the explosion spread over an area equal to that of Australia within a few days.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Amendment of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Concluded</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 24th] The negotiations on the amendment of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty are currently at a standstill, so that the British delegation can consult with Foreign Secretary Bevin. According to sources close to the Egyptian delegation, new obstacles have arisen in the issue of the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain and Egypt, and many Egyptians feel that this military alliance is quite inappropriate. They believe that Egypt should maintain neutrality in the event of war. The Egyptian delegation is finding it difficult to decide on this matter for the time being. As for the British side's attitude towards the negotiations, it can be seen in the article in the English-language "Egyptian Daily", which states that although the suspension of the treaty amendment negotiations is disappointing, considerable progress has been made in the negotiations and it is unlikely that they will break down again.</p>

<h3>Pre-University Students at the Capital Provisional University Strike and Coerce Authorities Express That If the Strike Continues, They Will Resolve the Issue Thoroughly</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Nanjing, This Newspaper] The pre-university students at the Capital Provisional University previously petitioned the Ministry of Education a week ago regarding the distribution issue. The Ministry of Education, based on the distribution method for pre-university students in the Great Rear Area (25% will be distributed to those who have completed one semester, 50% to those who have completed two semesters, and those whose grades do not meet the standards will apply to various universities themselves), Vice Minister Hang went to the class to give a speech, saying that due to the timely return of the National Central University's school buildings, the semester was ended early. As for the distribution standards, those whose grades meet the regulations will be allowed to be recommended for further study according to 50%. The students were satisfied with the resolution. Unexpectedly, at 8 a.m. on the 22nd, when the class was scheduled to take the final exam, a small number of students organized a patrol team to prevent other students from taking the exam, demanding that the Ministry of Education first announce the names of the universities to be distributed and the number of students they will accept. As for the remaining 50%, they wanted a clear announcement of the settlement plan. Because the majority of the coerced students demanded guarantees, the Ministry of Education requested more than a dozen unarmed military police to come to the scene to maintain order.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Received Reporters</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., Vice Minister Hang also received reporters from various newspapers, and Director Zhou of the Higher Education Department, Counselor Liu Yingshi, and Supervisor Peng Baichuan reported on the student strike and the pre-university student distribution methods. They said that the pre-university students at the Capital Provisional University had already been treated favorably (50% of those who completed one year of pre-university studies in the inland areas were distributed), and it was imperative. Vice Minister Hang also said that the pre-university student distribution methods had been implemented in the rear areas for several years, and no students had ever made unexpected demands or distributed more than 50%. Moreover, since the borrowed school buildings needed to be returned to the original owners urgently, the semester had to be ended early. Although the semester was ended early, those who studied for a short period of time could still obtain 50% distribution. Those who did not meet the standards could apply to universities themselves. Those who had no home to return to could register for relief at the Ministry of Education's Youth Employment Guidance Office. The Ministry of Education loves young people, and young people should follow the rules and participate in the exams. The Ministry of Education is determined not to follow the students' demands and will make legal and reasonable arrangements. Director Wang Shulin of the cram school also came to the scene to report that the class, on the recommendation of the professors' meeting, would postpone the exam for the cram school students from the 24th according to the original procedure. If the students had any further problems, the professors would resign en masse. On the same day, a portion of the pre-university students, more than 60 people, participated in the exam. Most of the others were coerced and unable to take the exam. That night, the students gathered again. The faculty and staff of the class repeatedly tried to persuade them to no avail, and even wanted to attend the students' meeting, but were rejected by the students, who said that this meeting was special and did not invite them to participate. On the morning of the 23rd, another portion of the students, more than 60 people, participated in the exam. Among the remaining 600 or so people, some were coerced and did not dare to take the exam. The students who took the exam mostly took their luggage from the Wenchangqiao dormitory and came to the Central dormitory. Only when there were a considerable number of people did they dare to take the exam. However, outside the classroom and upstairs, the students who opposed the exam shouted and cursed. The faculty and staff of the class believed that order was not easy to maintain, and it was heard that if there was still noise and disruption on the 24th, the exam would no longer be held.</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Received Reporters</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. on the 23rd, the faculty and staff of the class held a reception to receive reporters from various newspapers. Chen Jiefu, Mai Bingru, and Gao Hongkui, three faculty and staff members, reported that the faculty and staff had repeatedly persuaded the students. There were two petitions before, and after the faculty and staff tried their best to persuade them and Vice Minister Hang came to the class to give a speech, allowing them to be recommended for further study according to 50%, the matter was concluded. Recently, they again demanded that the Ministry of Education issue a clear announcement for the 50% distribution, and at the same time, a clear announcement of a proper settlement plan for the remaining 50% of the students, as well as the faculty and staff's various persuasions and hopes. On the same morning, a portion of the pre-university students gathered and went to the cram school to talk with the students. When they left, the military police saw a large number of people departing, so they followed them to the cram school and temporarily guarded the door. The military police dispersed shortly thereafter. The cram school students held a meeting, and the professors also held a meeting, wanting to persuade the students. The students only allowed one professor to participate and limited the speech to three minutes. The students had already stated that they would not take the exam on the 24th. Senior officials of the Ministry of Education, after hearing the report of Director Wang of the class, all believed that the students of the two classes had colluded and made unreasonable demands. They unanimously stated that they would take strict measures in accordance with the law. If the strike continued, they would issue a public order to thoroughly resolve the issue in order to rectify the academic atmosphere. (Yu)</p>

<h3>Responding to Readers: Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Huang Wenshu asks: I read your "Medicine and Health" column every day and admire it greatly. Now I have a few questions to ask, and I believe your helpful spirit will surely help me solve them. I (female) am 21 years old and have been continuously gaining weight since I was 18, with no signs of stopping. This is not only unaesthetic but also hinders my mobility. I have tried various methods to prevent further weight gain, but all have been ineffective. (1) Is this weight gain a pathological condition? (2) What injections or medications can remedy it? (3) Is restricting food intake effective? (4) Can eating starchy foods help reduce weight? (5) Will eating meat increase weight? (6) What effect do vegetables and fruits have on weight?</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): Abnormal weight gain is caused by dysfunction of the endocrine glands in the body. The treatment requires a full physical examination to determine the cause. Restricting food intake is not necessarily effective, but eating less meat and fat, eating more vegetables and fruits, and regular exercise can prevent excessive weight gain.</p>
<p>(2) Du Jiying asks: I was hospitalized in 1943 due to severe "sha-eye" (a type of eye disease). Although surgery was effective, it resulted in another more painful condition. Every one or two months, my vision becomes foggy, and I cannot read books, causing me great distress. What treatment is recommended?</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): Your condition is likely deep "sha-eye" combined with keratitis. You should consult a specialist ophthalmologist for a detailed examination before treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Lu Guochang asks: Due to congenital deficiency, I developed later than others. Although I am an adult, I have no sexual feelings. At 19, I engaged in masturbation due to bad influences, which I quit after a year. Now I am 30 and have never experienced sexual urges. I have tried Western injections and Chinese "secret formulas," but all have been ineffective. What treatment and effective medication are recommended for this condition? I would be grateful if you could publish this in the newspaper so that others suffering from this condition can benefit.</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): This is a case of sexual neurasthenia. Injections of male hormones or pituitary compound preparations are recommended.</p>
<p>(4) Chen Ruimei asks: Women generally fear being overweight, and I am no exception. I am a 16-year-old girl, and I used to be neither fat nor thin. However, after suffering from typhoid fever in the fall of my fifteenth year, I started gaining weight. If I continue to gain weight, it would be terrible. Therefore, I would like to ask you to help me solve this problem so that I can become slimmer. Also, my classmate is too short, so please tell her how she can grow taller. We thank you in advance.</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers): There are no specific medications for being overweight or too short. More exercise may be effective.</p>

<h3>Bulls Cash Out, Floating Capital Turns Around: Gold Prices Continue to Fall; US Dollar Absorbs at Low, but Still Weakens with the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, holders cashed out, resulting in an oversupply. The market opened weak and was immediately pressured by selling. There were rumors that the Central Bank had delegated full authority over market stabilization to Zhongdai Exchange. Bullish investors cashed out and gradually retreated to 1.83 million before a slight recovery. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 1.88 articles to dealers at a price of 1.845 million. Afterwards, it struggled around the allocation price for a long time. Near noon, the market rose to around 1.86 million due to abundant funds. The afternoon was similar. After 2:00 PM, there were no special changes in next-day delivery. Ornamental gold was 196,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars fell slightly. The black market interest rate was slightly stable, ranging from 15 to 18 points.</p>
<p>The US dollar encountered continuous absorption at low prices, and many people needing foreign exchange had a hoarding mentality. However, the weakening gold market offered no support for price increases. The market opened at 2380 yuan and briefly fell to 2340 yuan. It recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon, it struggled around 2360 yuan before finally closing at around 2350 yuan, a further decrease of 25 yuan. Hong Kong tickets remained sluggish, falling another 5 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were selling at 425 yuan due to the cessation of Indian cotton settlements, resulting in an oversupply. Indian exchange rates were 530 yuan. The official exchange rate for the US dollar remained flat, and the designated bank's selling price to a foreign firm fell slightly to 2060 yuan.</p>

<p>Another report states that promoting the direct sales of white coal lump is proving difficult for the moment, with importers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. They hope the market price will fall further to facilitate sales. However, sellers are holding firm on prices due to high operating costs, preventing transactions from taking off. Only the bituminous coal factories are slightly absorbing small amounts, and trading is gradually becoming active. In addition, the Municipal Mechanical Coal Factory Association and the Hand-operated Coal Briquette Factory Joint Office have been approved for a second allocation of Annam Hongji white coal dust as raw material for briquette production by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The price remains at 120,000 yuan per ton, delivered at the Pudong Wharf warehouse, and payment will be processed immediately.</p>
<h3>Significant Fluctuations in Yarn Prices: Spot Cotton Trading Suspended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yarn merchants still did not make large-scale purchases. Only inland merchants made some purchases. Prices for 20-count yarn saw mixed gains and losses, fluctuating between 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. Thread prices were also flat, with few transactions. At noon, Fangjian Textile Mill opened yarn sales as usual. Only 42-count Shuiyue thread and 20-count Shuiyue yarn were popular items. The former was listed at 2.43 million and the latter at 1.19 million, both slightly lower than the market price by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Unfortunately, supply was not sufficient, making it difficult to suppress yarn prices.</p>
<p>In the cotton market, New York American cotton ranged from 1 to 7 points above or below the average. Recent prices were 27.60, immediate prices were 28.25, and spot Mitling was 28.21. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai has completely stopped because gold is widely used downstream, causing manufacturers to remain cautious.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Stable</h3>
<p>Specially selected tribute tea has been continuously purchased and shipped for export by various Indian trading houses in the city. Current interest in purchasing remains considerable, but suppliers are adopting a defensive attitude due to the scarcity of stock, resulting in a lack of transactions. Although local stores and merchants in Suxi and other areas are inquiring about domestic floral teas, suppliers are closely monitoring the situation, so there is little change in the trend.</p>
<h3>Independent Speculators Join Forces: Yong Yarn Becomes the Target; General Hope for a One-for-Three Bonus Share Issue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, large money exchange firms concentrated their efforts on Yong Yarn, buying aggressively. Yong Yarn's gains were the strongest, overshadowing Meiya and other popular stocks. Opening high, Yong Yarn benefited from the afterglow of the previous evening. However, confidence was not strong, and the high price was unsustainable. Yong Yarn retreated from 5480 yuan to 5250 yuan, Meiya fell from 4300 to 4150 yuan, Jingfu dropped from 360 to 325 yuan, and Xinguang fell from 308 yuan to within 280 yuan. Qinxing retreated from 260 yuan to 232 yuan. However, floating capital in the financial sector continued to purchase Yong Yarn. The general expectation of a one-for-three bonus share issue drove up the stock. Other stocks were only dragged along passively. As a result, Yong Yarn rose 350 yuan, Meiya 100, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly. Other stocks saw only minor gains and losses. In the afternoon, reduced prices in the over-the-counter market continued to be driven up by Yong Yarn. Foreign stocks were mainly driven by large bond dealers. Securities firms and operators remained on the sidelines, causing most stocks, except for the thriving Yi Yarn and English Union, to lose luster and fail to follow suit. Therefore, the popular Yi Yarn slightly fell near the close. Yi Yarn and English Union rose by almost half a percent, while others saw only minor gains and losses. After closing, the two popular stocks, Yi Yarn and English Union, were bid up slightly in the over-the-counter market.</p>
<h3>Forty-Five Train Engines Ordered from the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] American train manufacturers have recently accepted foreign orders, including 45 train engines ordered by China, hundreds of train engines ordered by Poland, 100 50-ton open freight cars ordered by French North Africa, and 190 freight cars ordered by the Bolivian National Railway.</p>
<h3>Limited Sales of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The trend in the woolen fabric market was calm yesterday, with few changes in standard prices. Although spring goods were particularly cheap, they lacked buyers. Summer goods maintained their status quo, with only sporadic purchases. Sellers lacked the strength to hold out for higher prices because the sales season was more than halfway over, and stores were unwilling to hold onto goods. Autumn goods were mutually absorbed when cheap, while winter goods saw very few transactions due to the distant sales season. Real sales at retail stores and menswear shops have recently decreased due to the arrival of summer and the lack of decline in the cost of living. Due to limited real sales, wholesale transactions are also lacking.</p>
<h3>Australian Wheat Exports</h3>
<p>Mostly to Asian Countries</p>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 23rd] Australian officials said that Australia will export to India and other Asian countries before November. Australia is expected to harvest 144 million bushels of wheat this year. In addition, Australia's entire rice production this year has been allocated to the United Nations Food Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).</p>
<h3>Many Sausage Casings Rejected: Due to Non-Compliance with Standards</h3>
<p>According to authorities in the import and export industry, sausage casings account for the smallest number of China's postwar exports due to price restrictions abroad. In addition, foreign firms in the city have not yet begun purchasing and manufacturing. It is reported that a recent shipment of sausage casings was rejected due to substandard quality, with as many as fourteen barrels returned.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asian Rice Supply: 220,000 Tons Before June, 330,000 Tons Before September</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 23rd] According to Sir Gilbert McCallum, the British Food Commissioner in Singapore, the supply of rice from Southeast Asia to the world food market will reach 330,000 tons in the three months ending September 30. The rice production in the area for the three months ending June 30 is expected to be 220,000 tons, 65,000 tons less than expected.</p>
<h3>United States Raises Standards for Chinese Silk Uniformity</h3>
<p>According to a recent telegram received by a certain export firm from the United States, the United States is now receiving a steady flow of raw silk from overseas, so the standard for uniformity of Chinese silk has been raised to 80 points or higher. Therefore, domestic silk manufacturers exporting to the United States are expected to export according to this standard.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no change in factory prices in Shanghai. User silk saw some transactions. Silk with a uniformity of 81 points was offered at 1.95 million to 2 million yuan per load. Foreign firms devalued silk with a uniformity of 78 points to 2.3 million yuan, but holders were unwilling to sell at the low price, so no transactions took place.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Quite Active</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw a rise in northern sales, with strong demand for 12-pound grey cloth. Grey cloth merchants raised prices by an average of 1,500 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Old 　　Anhui North's demand remains strong. 　　　Guangdong and Hunan continue to purchase various colored cloths, but indigo-dyed cloth has not yet been touched, so the situation is still calm. Transactions at retail cloth stores on the street are becoming more active. After noon, 260 bolts of Four Gentlemen Yuan Bijie were purchased by customers, raising the price by 1,000 yuan to 55,000 yuan. New goods rose 1,500 yuan to 53,250 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prefabricated Houses Soon to be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] 1,000 to 1,500 prefabricated houses will soon be shipped from the United States to Nanjing to alleviate China's current severe housing shortage.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Reluctant to Set Prices First Yesterday Morning: Market Delayed for Two Hours; Stalled Situation Broken After Persuasion by Responsible Persons</h3>
<p>The Qing Liange Rice Industry Temporary Market, with trading hours originally from 9:00 AM to noon, was delayed yesterday. Rice merchants, wary of the arbitrary price increases by Rong Yongming, manager of Wu Chang Rice Store, being questioned by the Social Affairs Bureau, were reluctant to be the first to set prices, observing for a long time. Subsequently, Wan Molin, chairman of the Rice Number Industry Association, Xing Zhigang, director of the market, Zhu Yongming, and others visited the market to persuade them. After conveying the authorities' intention to protect legitimate rice merchants, the stalled situation was broken, and trading resumed, but it was already past 11:00 AM. Therefore, only one hour of trading took place yesterday. There was slight absorption on the street, and trading was very light. The authorities are closely monitoring the situation in the rice market and will severely punish any attempt to speculate. As for Rong Yongming, manager of Wu Chang Rice Store, although bail has been granted, the authorities are determined to carefully examine his accounts. If manipulation is found, they will be strictly investigated according to the law to prevent emulation.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Slightly Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw weak supply and demand. Japonica and Indica raw rice both fell by 500 to 600 yuan. The oil market also saw no changes. Soybean sales were normal. Corn prices surged by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to increased demand from Qingdao. Yuan wheat also added 1,000 yuan, and wheat also rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan due to strong sales in Qingdao. According to the Rice Market, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday was just over 6,000 shi.</p>
<p>Estimated Inventory</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau's inventory registration ended yesterday. According to reporters, about 200 bean and rice businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 70,000 shi. About 1,400 rice number businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 120,000 shi. About 50 retail businesses registered their inventory, with a total of about 20,000 shi.

<h3>First Batch of Foreign Rice Loaded: Chairman Su Shao Cables Production Areas Not to Hinder Food Circulation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] It is reported that the foreign rice purchased by the Ministry of Food has been loaded onto the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Su wheel in Haiphong and shipped to Shanghai yesterday, totaling several thousand tons.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Taihu Lake area, including Wuxi and Suchang, which produces rice, previously reported news of restricting the export of rice, which has affected Shanghai's supply. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Government to stop it. A reply telegram was received from Chairman Wang: "After investigating, the counties such as Wuxi previously adopted registration methods to prevent illegal grain merchants from speculating and manipulating. This government has already cabled to correct this and ordered that the free circulation of food should not be hindered. In addition to instructing the county governments concerned to strictly comply, a special telegram has been sent for inspection."</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>

<p>Changchun, 29th Day (7th)</p>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw on April 7th, and the Soviet army at the West Airport withdrew on the evening of the 8th. At that time, key central government officials withdrew one after another, and news colleagues also left successively. We arrived in Changchun on the 9th, truly risking our lives to fly there, and not a single friend agreed with our approach. At that time, government personnel remaining in Changchun and Central News Agency's Liu Zhuzhou were ordered to stay in Changchun. At this time, everyone hoped that the government's regular army could be airlifted in a timely manner, because there were six days from the withdrawal of the Soviet army until the 14th. Everyone thought that if the regular army was stationed in Changchun, it could be firmly defended, and Changchun might even be spared a major battle. However, everyone waited eagerly, but there was no news of an airlift. As for the subsequent airdrop of ammunition that did not match the caliber, it also proved that the government army had no preparation whatsoever.</p>
<p>Post-War Reminiscences</p>
<p>Regarding Defense Commander Chen Jiazhen, he was a former Northeast Army cadre from the Shenyang Military Academy, and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang was a classmate of the Communist general Lü Zhengcao. In the past, he served as a senator in the Military Affairs Commission, and after the victory, he served as a major general senior staff officer in the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, and also as a member of the military delegation. Dong Yanping designated him to be in charge of military affairs before leaving, which seemed to be a decision made in haste. However, militarily speaking, temporarily taking control and commanding the security team is not an easy task. Moreover, the scale of this war was quite large, and Chen had no such experience in his past military life. However, Chen Jiazhen was firm, calm, and did his best to execute his duties, giving it his all.</p>
<p>Before the war, we visited various places to inspect fortifications. Changchun has many solid buildings that can be relied upon for resistance, but the security team also set up some reserve positions and obstacles. These fortifications were of course quite crude. On the evening of the 10th, two Soviet tanks suddenly drove in from the southern part of the city, turned to the Central Bank, stopped in front of the police headquarters, and then turned west. The barbed wire and crude fortifications were all destroyed. The next day we went to see them, only to find security team soldiers repairing them. Although Changchun has many institutions, they were all empty, and there was no unified organization. Faced with the tense situation, no one could command anyone. Zhao Junmai, the mayor of Hengyang, Liu Zhe, the director of the China Chang Railway Company, and Wang Jiazhen, a member of the Economic Commission, sent a joint telegram to Director Xiong on the 12th, requesting him to come in person to oversee the situation. But it was too late. After a major battle ended, we knew that Changchun was in ruins. The large buildings that remained relatively intact, except for the Yamato Hotel, were all destroyed. Only the Manchurian Coal Building was still unscathed. Forty percent of the city's buildings were gone, and at least 6,000 Chinese people died or were injured, including civilians and security team members.</p>
<p>Since the 19th, our life in Changchun could be said to be free, but not entirely free, and not entirely unfree either. The subtle difference between so-called freedom and unfreedom is truly extremely nuanced.</p>
<p>Mayor Captured</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, the gunfire was sparse. We asked the guarding Communist soldiers, and they said, "We don't know who's shooting." Later, a political instructor from a company came and said, "Kuomintang secret agents and traitors will fire shots at any time." But he also admitted that their own soldiers would also fire machine guns randomly, saying, "These are the new sounds of testing guns seized from the enemy."</p>
<p>As we were about to have breakfast, we suddenly saw Captain Cao of the Air Force Headquarters being escorted by several Communist soldiers. Cao was wearing a black cotton robe, with a Japanese military coat on top, looking very disheveled. Accompanying him was a section chief named Bai Juren, who was under the command of Major General Liu Qiren, the political instructor of the western siege force.</p>
<p>When Cao saw that Zhao Junmai was still alive, he was very happy. He said, "I haven't eaten, slept, or washed my face for a day and a night."</p>
<p>While washing up, he told us, "Liu Zhuzhou broke through with Commander Chen Jiazhen yesterday. Shao Shenzhi did not see him before the breakthrough. The fate of both is unknown." We were stunned, and our hearts were weeping silently.</p>
<p>Section Chief Bai, who accompanied Captain Cao, explained Liu Qiren's and Sun Zheng's intention to invite us to talk, and then said to Zhao Junmai, "Mayor Zhao, please come and talk too!" He already knew that Zhao Junmai was no longer Yang Huabai of the Ta Kung Pao.</p>
<p>Two cars of eight people drove through the city. We recognized that Liu Qiren's headquarters was the original General Post Office building.</p>
<p>The corridors on the second floor of the General Post Office building were filled with wounded soldiers, some cursing, some groaning, and others staring at us with strange eyes. Several Communist female soldiers, who spoke good Russian, thought the American reporters were Soviet people and came up to them, saying, "Россия, хорошо!" The American colleagues did not understand what they were saying. After translation, they said they were Americans, and the female soldiers became cold.</p>
<p>In the room at the end on the left, Section Chief Bai asked Mayor Zhao to wait there for a while, and asked us to talk to Liu and Sun first. Zhao had no choice but to obey and walked into that room. Shi Xun was curious and followed in, but saw Lai Bingquan, the director of the Provisional Headquarters, Wu Shiyi, the senior staff officer, and Zhang Datong, the secretary of the Economic Commission. We didn't say anything. Shi Xun made a face at Datong, and Datong gave him a wry smile.</p>
<p>We waited for about ten minutes. We were invited into a room with relatively bright light. The first to come out to meet us was Sun Zheng, who still wore a stern face, without a trace of a smile. Then Liu Qiren also came. He first expressed his condolences to us, and then explained that the situation had not yet stabilized, and for safety's sake, it was best not to go out. We asked him that we wanted to see new things and report new historical facts. He did not give us a definite answer. We finally asked him that we were willing to write a "letter of voluntary assumption of risk" stating that "if we lose our lives, it has nothing to do with you," because our identity was that of war correspondents. But he finally refused our request. He promised that if the situation improved, we could go out immediately. He promised to introduce us to General Zhou Baozhong, the supreme commander of the Communist army attacking Changchun, and he promised that we would have absolute freedom of interview. In an hour-long conversation, we didn't get anything. We only learned that Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the city defense, was wounded in the leg.</p>
<p>We walked out of the room, wanting to find Zhao Junmai to go back with us. Suddenly, Sun Zheng said, "Mr. Zhao is not going back today, we will be responsible for entertaining him." We knew that from today onwards, this Yang Huabai, who had disguised himself as a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, had been captured. But Zhao got along very well with us. Although he was straightforward, we all liked him. Elberna was heartbroken to see this old classmate from Wisconsin being separated from them. We asked to see him one last time before parting. With Sun Zheng's permission, we each shook Zhao's hand tightly, and everyone said "Take care" to each other, parting in sadness.</p>
<p>We Lost Our Freedom</p>
<p>The same car took us back. We asked the driver to stop and walked to the vicinity of Datong Square. We saw that the flames of the municipal government building had not yet subsided, and the heat was too intense to pass through.</p>
<p>We returned home as before. Zhao Junmai was gone, and the house had no owner, like a person who had lost their soul. Everyone was extremely melancholy, unable to find anything to start a conversation with. Shi Xun went into the bedroom, wanting to sleep. Unexpectedly, there was already someone sleeping in the bed. Flipping open the blanket, we saw that it was none other than Shenzhi. The two of us were stunned, unable to speak for a long time. Our joy overflowed in our strong embrace. Everyone was relieved to know that Shenzhi had returned and welcomed him back. Shenzhi was thinner in spirit, and he had suffered the same fate as Shi Xun in terms of material possessions. His belongings had been robbed six times, and he had also gone a day and a night without eating, sleeping, or washing his face.</p>
<p>We all agreed that our days of staying here would not be short. The immediate problems were food and servants. After dinner, we held a meeting and decided that all food and other expenses would be shared equally by the eight of us, and all five servants would be kept. At the same time, it was decided that Shi Xun would be in charge of food and Shenzhi would be in charge of accounting.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, we were still waiting for Liu Qiren to send a car to allow us to go out and interview. But near lunchtime, another political instructor of a battalion came. The political instructors of the Communist army at the battalion and company levels were indeed not easy to deal with. They came in and talked about a long string of political theories, and we understood these political theories, or even knew them better than they did. Sometimes they treated us as Kuomintang spies, trying to trick us with words, and sometimes they treated us as uneducated soldiers who had been captured, using their consistent political theories to indoctrinate us. We really didn't want to listen, but we were embarrassed to ask them to leave. The more they talked, the more excited they became, and the more we listened, the more we hated it. We hated that they couldn't talk about anything new, hated that they didn't understand anything outside their political consciousness, and hated their arrogant and unreasonable attitude. These political instructors did not recognize our identity as reporters. In their eyes, we were superior prisoners of war. This aversion was completely different from the conversation we had with Kai Feng, the director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>For example, this political instructor insisted on emphasizing the Long March of the Red Army in the past. In fact, we understood this even more than he did. He said, "Our feet have replaced any means of transportation, so our feet are our glory." We had heard this sentence several times, and he couldn't say anything else besides expressing this point. We had no choice but to listen and deal with it perfunctorily. He seemed to feel bored when he saw that we were not getting excited and quietly left.</p>
<p>At lunchtime, Zhao Junmai returned with two Communist soldiers who were monitoring him. We were surprised, thinking he had been released. Later, we learned that he had come to get his bedding. From him, we learned that more than 30 government officials were imprisoned in Madame Chiang's residence. At that time, the house was still called Lü Mansion, which was the official residence of the puppet Manchu Minister Lü Ronghuan. In addition, he also told us about the safety of Major Reik, the military attache of the American Embassy, but he heard that the plane he had flown in on had been burned.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as Shi Xun was walking out of the courtyard, a Communist soldier's shiny bayonet was pointed at Shi Xun's chest, and he said menacingly, "You are not allowed to come out!" Shi Xun retreated. The other Chinese and foreign colleagues also knew about it. So we went to ask the soldier. He said, "The order from above is that you are not allowed to go out!" We knew there was no point in arguing with him. He openly fired his gun in the garden of our neutral journalist residence. We didn't say anything, we knew we had lost our freedom.</p>
<h3>A Letter of Protest - To General Zhou Baozhong</h3>
<p>That night, we felt an unusual pain in our spirits. We didn't know what would happen in the future, because the development of the situation and the so-called "safety" and "protection" we knew were completely different. After dinner, we were no longer as comfortable as we had been the day before. Everyone sat around the table, playing the game of connecting English letters. Tonight, we made a very serious decision: to send a letter of protest to Zhou Baozhong, the Communist commander-in-chief of Changchun, tomorrow. This letter of protest was written in English, drafted by Lippmann of the New York Times, and after everyone agreed, we all signed our names and wrote the names of the different newspapers we represented.</p>
<p>The translated text of the protest letter is as follows:</p>
<p>'General Zhou Baozhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army in the Changchun Area:</p>
<p>Several soldiers of the Eighth Route Army who are guarding us under your command have detained us for two or three days.</p>
<p>In the past, General Liu Qiren and General Sun Zheng told us that for our "safety", our movements were to be restricted. They also said that as soon as the battle of Changchun ended, we could move freely.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for their concern for our safety, but we have also pointed out to them that danger is an integral part of our work. We are war correspondents, and we have been through battles large and small in the East and West, defeating Japan and defeating Germany. We are very eager to interview the latest new openings, and danger is a common amusement for us.</p>
<p>Since we talked to them, we have found that the guarding soldiers have clearly told us in the execution of his order: freedom has disappeared under force. In this situation, we dare not have any hope, we only consider ourselves prisoners of the Eighth Route Army.</p>
<p>The battle in Changchun has long since stopped, and there should be no serious danger to our "safety" in the current situation. Therefore, we protest against the unreasonable detention. We have talked with many Communist personnel in Yan'an, Chongqing, Beiping, and we all feel that news coverage in the Communist areas is free. And welcome us to help us get the latest reports.</p>
<p>We now want to reclaim our rights. We would also like to talk to you, although we have met with Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Ye Jianying from the Communist side.</p>
<p>We also ask you to allow us to use the CCP's radio station to send a telegram to the Executive Headquarters in Beiping to send a plane to pick us up and hope that you will restore our freedom as usual."</p>
<p>The next morning (the 21st), Section Chief Bai came again. We asked him if he could forward this letter to Zhou Baozhong. He said, "It will definitely be delivered." Section Chief Bai Juren had been a Communist for only a year, according to what he told us. We didn't know if it was true or false, but we believed that he wouldn't tell us the truth, and we didn't believe that he had only joined the Communist Party for a year.</p>
<h3>Meeting Zhou Baozhong</h3>
<p>When Bai Juren was about to walk out of the house quickly, Major Reich suddenly arrived, his pistol still at his side. We were overjoyed. We expressed our concern for him, and he said that the phone lines were down and the fighting was too intense, so he couldn't get through for a while. We temporarily forgot all the pain of being unfree, and everyone crowded around the round table again, asking the cook to add a few more dishes. Reich and Beckett drank heartily with vodka.</p>
<p>Major Reich liked Chinese food and had the forthright manner typical of Americans. When talking to him, he also had the beautiful and refined vocabulary of a diplomat. Everyone liked his humor and wit. So when he wanted to return to his residence at the Yamato Hotel, everyone refused to let him go and wanted him to stay with us.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, Section Chief Bai came again. He brought a letter, and we were surprised, thinking that Zhou Baozhong had written back to us so quickly. Upon opening it, we realized that Liu Qiren was inviting us to a "banquet" on behalf of Zhou Baozhong for tomorrow. There was no time, no address; it was a "strange" simple invitation.</p>
<p>Afterward, Bai Juren explained to Reich that Liu Qiren wanted to see him. Reich was also willing to see Liu Qiren because he wanted to know: (1) whether his plane was safe; (2) whether he could get some gasoline from the Communist side. He originally wanted to have Shi Xun go with him as his translator, but Bai Juren did not agree. He said, "General Liu can find an interpreter there." But Reich insisted, "If the interpreter is not good, I want you to bring Mr. Zhao." Before Reich said this, he first consulted Shi Xun's consent.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, Shi Xun was taken to the Mantetsu Building in a jeep. This was Shi Xun's first, and also last, time to re-enter the gray building after the Changchun incident. At that time, the emotions were truly mixed, and it was difficult to express in words.</p>
<p>Shi Xun walked into Dong Yanping's former office. Everything was still almost the same as before. The only difference was that the corridors were crowded with many soldiers, who went into the washroom and left the faucets running. This lively scene was in stark contrast to the desolation, chaos, and fear of the headquarters after Dong Yanping left. Because after Dong Yanping left Changchun, the situation was critical, and all the sensitive central officials left Changchun one after another. The so-called recovering Changchun, recovering the hearts of 800,000 people in Changchun, was simply bragging. The dead, the wounded, the burned, and the losses, this debt of blood, was all on the heads of the common people.</p>
<p>Reich wanted to go to the airfield himself to see the plane. Liu Qiren could not make a decision. He just kept smoking Lequn cigarettes. Lequn cigarettes were top-grade among the local products of Changchun. The two sides argued for a long time, and Liu Qiren agreed to Reich negotiating with Zhou Baozhong.</p>
<p>So Bai Juren took us to Zhou Baozhong's place again. At that time, his headquarters were in a small factory. From the outside, it was impossible to tell that it was a headquarters. That house was in the direction of the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>Zhou Baozhong agreed to Major Reich's request. Turning around, he said to Shi Xun, "Since Mr. Zhao represents a non-partisan newspaper and is a liberal, our conversation will be easier from now on."</p>
<p>Zhou then said, "I am indeed a little worried about your safety where you are staying. I have prepared a hotel for you now. After I send Major Reich back, I will send you to that hotel. Don't leave now. As for the other American and Chinese reporters, I have also decided to move them tonight." He said these words without first seeking Shi Xun's personal consent, nor respecting the individual freedom that the Communist Party had always proclaimed. Shi Xun fell silent and sat there solemnly, not expressing an opinion.</p>
<p>Reich didn't understand what Zhou was up to and wanted Shi Xun to explain it to him. When Reich understood what Shi Xun said, he immediately said to Zhou, "Mr. Zhao is someone I invited to help you and me communicate. I have the obligation to personally send him back. I think his accommodations there are very comfortable, something a hotel cannot match."</p>
<p>Finally, Zhou asked Section Chief Bai about our comfort. He agreed with Reich. It was already seven o'clock. Shi Xun came back, and everyone kept asking about the process before they could rest assured. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Bay of Green Water, Lychees Red on Both Banks: Early Summer Scenery of Lingnan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou Airmail, This Newspaper, 17th</p>
<p>When the kapok flowers on the top of Yuexiu Mountain have all fallen, and the fluff is scattered all over the sky, this tells the people of the South that summer has already arrived on the earth. The reporter once spent several summers in Chongqing, and in those places with a continental climate, it was really uncomfortable. This time, returning to the South, I couldn't help but have a completely different feeling; because in the early summer in the South, although the scorching sun hangs high in the sky during the day, shining strongly on people, once night falls, a gentle breeze blows, making the earth cool, eliminating all the heat of the day. Therefore, the "Spring of the South" is certainly lovely, but the "Early Summer of Lingnan" really has something attractive!</p>
<h3>Eat Three Hundred Lychees a Day, Willing to Be a Lingnan Person</h3>
<p>Now lychees, mangoes, bananas, oranges, apples, peaches, plums, apricots, water chestnuts, pears... all kinds of things are available and have been successively put on the market! However, among these many fruits, the one that can represent this season and is worth introducing should be the lychee!</p>
<p>Regarding the sweetness and richness of the lychee, many people in history have praised it in poems, such as Du Mu's poem: "A rider raises dust, a concubine laughs, no one knows it's lychees coming!" and Emperor Huizong of Song's poem: "Jade liquid congeals like celestial dew, crimson buds form crystal beads." This shows that the ancients liked to eat lychees and described their color, taste, and sweetness. Bai Letian said in "Preface to the Lychee Garden": "The shell is like red paint, the membrane like purple essence, the flesh as white as ice and snow, the juice as sweet as wine, if separated from the branch, the color changes in one day, the fragrance changes in two days, and the taste changes in three days." From this, we also see that lychees cannot be tasted for their true flavor if they are separated from the branch for three days. Therefore, everyone says that Lingnan lychees are the best, probably because they are produced more here; in fact, all fruits are more delicious the fresher they are. Lychees eaten in places where they are not produced are naturally things that have been picked from the tree for more than three days, so how can they compare to eating them here so fresh? No wonder the Song poet Su Dongpo also said: "Eat three hundred lychees a day, I would not refuse to be a Lingnan person for life!"</p>
<p>When the lychees are red, a summer resort worth introducing here is Lychee Bay! That place is in the western suburbs of Guangzhou City, accessible by public bus, so transportation is still convenient. That bay is a small tributary of the Pearl River, originally the site of the historical Changhua Imperial Palace. Because the environment on both sides of the river is beautiful, many high officials and nobles built villas there, so people gradually discovered that it was a good place to play in the summer. Some water residents even built many elegant pleasure boats and sampans, so that tourists could hire boats to play. Soon, it became a scenic spot for people to visit in the summer. Lychee Bay is not as prosperous as the Qinhuai River, nor as quiet as the West Lake, nor as famous as Xuanwu Lake. However, its advantage is that there is no artificial rendering at all, purely a natural face. It also has a special feature, that is, lychee trees are planted on both sides of the stream. Every summer, bright red lychees hang on the trees, truly making people's mouths water, and Lychee Bay gets its name from this. In the past, someone described the scenery of Lychee Bay, saying "A bay of green water, lychees red on both banks." These two lines of poetry can be said to be a vivid and thorough description.</p>
<h3>Lychees Red on Both Banks of the Bay, Many Pleasure Boats on Moonlit Nights</h3>
<p>Before the war, it was extremely lively there! On both sides of Lychee Bay, in addition to some villas with red walls and green tiles, there were also many amateur organizations, such as music societies, sports clubs, dance clubs, and clubs, etc., in abundance. One of the larger ones was the "West Suburb Swimming Pool," where there were at least three thousand "swimmers" every day. The most numerous were treasure ships and sampans, with more than two thousand boats, as well as countless small boats selling salted plums, selling food, selling boat congee, selling wonton noodles, selling ice cream, and singing, crisscrossing back and forth, peddling to tourists. There were also dozens of "Purple Cave Boats" selling wine and dishes, which were specially for high officials and nobles to entertain guests. The furnishings of these small boats were extremely luxurious, surpassing those of general land-based restaurants. Every time the lights were lit, one could see teams of pleasure boats and small boats, like ministers crossing the river, anchored under the shade of the lychee blossoms, whispering sweet nothings to each other. There were also families, large and small, bringing the old and the young, to enjoy the night scenery of Lychee Bay. They could also taste the boat congee after eating lychees, or eat one or two cups of ice cream, so-called mixing ice and snow lotus root, with great joy. There were also many young men and women, floating in the West Suburb Swimming Pool, like mandarin ducks playing in the water, while the high officials and nobles set up luxurious feasts on the "Purple Cave Boats," raising their glasses to the moon, with singers singing at the bow, which was even more of a situation of "singing to wine, how much is life."</p>
<h3>The Summer of Lychee Bay in the 27th Year of the Republic, Singing and Music Every Night</h3>
<p>The summer of the 27th year of the Republic can be said to be the heyday of Lychee Bay. At that time, singing and music every night, wine green and lanterns red, all night long, it was truly a sleepless place. But after Guangzhou fell, that place became a forbidden area, because at that time the enemy stationed troops there to monitor the boats coming and going on the Pearl River, and on the opposite bank of Lychee Bay, our guerrillas often appeared, so the enemy had strict guards there, truly "no admittance for the living."</p>
<p>Last year, after Guangzhou was restored, the reporter went to Lychee Bay once, but it was just a case of "the face remains, but the peach blossoms are gone," no longer having the same scenery as in the past. The villas with green tiles and red walls of the past have become broken walls and ruins, tourists have disappeared, leaving the pleasure boats from seven or eight years ago, all "boats unmanned, lying across," silently tied under the lychee trees, gazing at the surface of the Pearl River, even more desolate, only worthy of lamentation.</p>
<h3>Lychee Bay Gained Freedom This Year, the River Water is Greener Than Before</h3>
<p>This year, this Lychee Bay, which seems to have spent seven long years in prison, has now regained its freedom! Look! This year, the river water in Lychee Bay seems to be greener than before, and the lychees on both banks are even more vividly red and bright. Elegant yachts have been increasing one after another, the small boats selling food have also returned to their original state, and someone is also starting to build the West Suburb Swimming Pool. All of this shows the new atmosphere of Lychee Bay. Friends, if you come to Guangzhou and don't visit Lychee Bay, that is truly your loss!</p>
<p>(May 17th, in Guangzhou)</p>
<h3>The Great Wall on the River in Anhui Province, on Which the Lives and Property of Four Million People Depend: The Completion of the 200-Li-Long Wuhe River Embankment</h3>
<p>— Correspondent Bai Yuwen, Wuhu, This Newspaper, 20th</p>
<p>Concerning the lives and property of four million people, the Wuhe River Embankment in the seven counties of Hefei, Chaoxian, Shucheng, Hanshan, Lujiang, Wuwei, and Hexian in southern Anhui Province, is 200 li long, equivalent to 110 kilometers. Before the war, it often breached due to tides and floods. After the war, the enemy built bunkers and dug trenches, causing even more collapse. The height was also below the water level of the 20-year flood. At the beginning of the establishment of the Anhui Relief Branch, it was deeply aware of the importance of this project, so it re-built it in the form of work-for-relief, in order to advance relief and rehabilitation at the same time. After initial team measurement, construction started on the entire line on May 28th. The types of the entire embankment project were: new embankment construction for the original embankment that had collapsed too severely; dangerous work for embankment bodies that were too low, below the flood level, or partially damaged too severely, requiring major repairs; plain work for the original embankment that was still intact, but needed to be raised and thickened for consolidation; pond work for bailing water and filling mud to cultivate the beach; and sand work for picking sand and soil or removing sand accumulation from the original embankment foundation. The construction standards were stipulated as: (1) raising one meter above the 20-year flood level; (2) minimum width of eight meters; (3) inner slope ratio of 1:2; and outer slope ratio of 1:3. This embankment work was for relief purposes, and the recruitment of labor was targeted at the poor. A total of 73,139 civilian laborers and embankment laborers were recruited, with 22 people in a squad, three squads in a company, and three companies in a battalion. The district township chiefs served as squad leaders and were responsible for distributing flour. The flour was distributed at a rate of one jin per cubic foot, distributed every five days. In addition, clothing relief was provided, with a total of 180 packages of used clothing distributed. Those with better performance were given double rewards. Therefore, in just 50 days of construction, the great Great Wall on the river, the greatest embankment project in history, was completed. The Relief Branch specifically held a grand completion ceremony on May 20th, and also invited the leaders of all sectors and the press here, taking a special ferry across the river to participate in the ceremony.</p>

<h3>We Need "Literary Correspondence"</h3>
<p>— Editor-in-Chief</p>
<p>Recently, Western-published magazines have seen the rise of a type of magazine called "news magazines," and some people in our country are also calling for "news magazineization." I don't think these names, "news magazine" or "news magazineization," easily reveal their nature to us. Generally speaking, the articles published in magazines use a light and literary style to narrate the news using the techniques of writing magazine articles, which is different from ordinary news reports.</p>
<p>I think the term "literary correspondence" is more appropriate. However, the name "literary correspondence" can sometimes be interpreted as the kind of writing that reports literary news or literary trends. Here, of course, news is the main body, the content, and the use of literary techniques is only a matter of skill.</p>
<p>Literature is emotionalized and visualized through people's feelings and imagination. It can satisfy people's strong inner demands and is an indispensable spiritual supplement for everyone. It can nourish our desolate mood and cultivate the vitality that life urgently needs. If we want to strengthen people's understanding of the world situation and help people understand the real social life, the most effective method is to launch a "literary correspondence" movement, advocating the use of literary methods to report on the objective social situation at this stage and the dynamics of key figures in the current situation.</p>
<p>A boring piece of news will never be as moving as a vivid literary correspondence, because people's hearts have already aroused a strong demand when reading "literary correspondence," and they feel an unspeakable pleasure, which is incomparable to ordinary news. Therefore, in order to complete the highest task of news reporting, we should create a common atmosphere of "literary correspondence" and penetrate all levels of society.</p>
<p>Now many people are demanding that literary writers take a realistic path. Literature is a reflection of real society. What else can be expressed if it is separated from the "people" and "things" that exist vividly in society? The most important task of news reporting is to record the living "people" and "things" in the living society, which is also the task that literary writers should undertake. Therefore, those who aspire to engage in literary creation can work hard in the field of "literary correspondence."</p>
<p>Good "literary correspondence" can also provide writers with rich material, allowing them to get closer to reality and better express the living "people" and "things" in this living society through emotional and imaginative creation. If the author can use the precise observation of interview news to portray real life, they will definitely be able to produce works with flesh and blood. In this way, literary correspondence can not only serve as a reference for literary authors, but also deepen their writing skills through this training.</p>
<p>We hope that the news media and magazines will promote the "literary correspondence" that most people need today.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>History of the Second World War</h3>
<p>— Wang Ciqing</p>
<p>Author: Chu Yukun Publisher: Yongxiang Printing House</p>
<p>In the past, our country's writing circles have relied on foreign works for works on world history. The so-called works are just compilations and translations. It is rare to find a book that completely relies on one's own perspective to compile and write a history book from historical materials from various countries in the world. The several general histories of the West, histories of World War I, and modern histories of the West published in our country all have blueprints. From this point of view, we can also know the immaturity of our country's writing circles.</p>
<p>The author of the History of the Second World War, Chu Yukun, from September 1, 1939, to August 15, 1945, collected materials at any time during these full six years and wrote down what he had researched. For six years, he never stopped. Indeed, he put in a lot of effort and mental energy. According to the author in the preface, the original manuscript of this book had gone through difficulties and stayed in the Japanese military police for more than a month before it was liberated with the arrival of victory. It is especially precious to see the publication of this book today.</p>
<p>After reading this book of nearly 300,000 words, I think there are several characteristics that are worth introducing to readers.</p>
<p>First, the author's writing is smooth and vivid. Although the description of the war is extremely detailed, it does not feel dull.</p>
<p>Second, the content is rich, and the process of the war is narrated from beginning to end, without omission, which can be used as a reference for studying international issues.</p>
<p>Third, when we talk about history, what we pay most attention to is the causes and consequences. The author analyzes the war situation and the successes, failures, gains, and losses of various countries in great detail with his perspective on studying international issues, which can be read as a modern history.</p>
<p>Fourth, in addition to the 300,000 words in the entire book, there are also more than 60 photos and illustrations, which make the content more colorful.</p>
<p>However, this book also has its shortcomings, which we especially want to point out, hoping that the author will revise them when it is reprinted. The first is that there are too many typos, probably due to poor proofreading. Second, the historical materials are biased towards the European part, while the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War are only briefly described. Although the author explains his reasons in the preface, we still hope that he can accept our criticism and revise and supplement it when it is reprinted, so that it can become a complete history book.</p>
<p>Finally, we should cherish and reward the works that the author spent five or six years of effort and time to write, otherwise the writer's accumulation is really too bitter. In any case, this book is a masterpiece in the modern Chinese publishing world and is worth recommending to readers.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Concise, Simple, and Popular History of Western Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Si Mu</p>
<p>Author: Li Changzhi</p>
<p>Publisher: Zhengzhong Bookstore</p>
<p>Publication Date: November 1945</p>
<p>I have read no less than a dozen works on the history of Western philosophy before, most of which are translations. The original material was already boring and tasteless, plus the stiff translation, and anyone who read it would feel dull. Some writings are too focused on one side and cannot integrate the entire development of the history of Western philosophical thought, making it impossible for us to peek at the trajectory of the progress of Western intellectual history. At the same time, because those books are too Confucian in style, modern people naturally do not easily feel interested in that kind of scholastic book.</p>
<p>I often wondered: why isn't there a History of Western Philosophy that is more clearly concise and suitable for general reading? It wasn't until now that I discovered an ideal History of Western Philosophy, that is, Li Changzhi's "History of Western Philosophy." I think this book is written very concisely, without verbose words, and can outline a profile of the history of Western philosophy with an objective attitude. After reading this book, we can get a clear concept, which guides us to further enter the hall of Western philosophical thought.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Western Magazines</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>During the war, the United States saw the emergence of many "Reader's Digest" type magazines, including Reader's Scope, Read, Fact, Digest &amp; Review, etc. Of these, only the first one can be encountered from time to time in Shanghai's bookstores; the rest have not yet appeared in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A new book and newspaper called See has been released, standing in opposition to Look.</p>
<p>The name of the newly released popular science magazine is Science Illustrated, and it is said that the illustrations are quite appropriate.</p>
<p>The original version of Life newspaper states that "non-military subscribers must wait three months after receiving the order before delivery can begin." Readers who entrust bookstores in Shanghai to subscribe to the original version of the newspaper should pay attention.</p>
<p>According to recent letters from American book and newspaper companies, popular magazines that are selling well are still unable to be purchased in large quantities. It is unknown whether this is due to a shortage of paper or to the large-scale supply of military use.</p>
<p>The Saturday Evening Post Company has released a new monthly magazine called Holiday, which is said to have quite exciting content.</p>
<p>Most British pre-war magazines are now continuing to be published, but due to the lack of paper rationing, their length is pitifully thin. For example, Times Literary Supplement, John o' London's Weekly, and Answers are only one-third of their former length.</p>
<h3>Genius</h3>
<p>— Emerson</p>
<p>Genius is a comprehensive intelligence accidentally gathered in a single specified direction. – Johnson</p>
<p>In the minds of ordinary people, genius can do everything, except one thing: solve its own livelihood. – Ruskin</p>
<h3>Truly Giant Publication</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fu</p>
<p>"Seeking Truth Magazine"</p>
<p>Many magazines call themselves "giant," but in reality, they only appear giant on the surface, far from being truly giant. Open books and newspapers are not truly giant. Any magazine with a sixteen-page format is not even giant in form if it only has one or two sheets of paper. Furthermore, if a magazine, whether sixteen-page or any other format, can use four or five sheets of paper, it might barely pass as giant in form, but whether its content is worthy of being called giant becomes a problem. Among the hundreds of magazines today, comparing their appearance and content, I cannot help but say that "Seeking Truth Magazine," published on May 1st, is a truly giant publication!</p>
<p>Of course, the content of a publication is more important than its appearance, so we might as well examine the content of "Seeking Truth" to see where its "giantness" lies.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the dozens of articles inside each have their own characteristics. There will absolutely not be the current bad habits of distorting publicity, selling gimmicks, being shallow and boring, plagiarizing, wasting printing materials, and poisoning people. As examples, the following articles are particularly worth reading carefully:</p>
<h3>On the Epoch-Making Significance of the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>Among the various articles commemorating the May Fourth Movement, this can be said to be the most detailed, most thorough, and most accurately judgmental.</p>
<h3>Antidote to the "Critique of Ancient History"</h3>
<p>This is sure to have a glorious place in the history of Chinese academia or thought. It dares to challenge the powerful "Critique of Ancient History." Its courage is great, and its weapons are especially sharp.</p>
<h3>Lao Tzu's Philosophy and His Social Thought</h3>
<p>It integrates the ancient with the present, and uses the present to verify the ancient, something that people with shallow knowledge cannot write.</p>
<p>In the inaugural speech "Founding Purpose," they put forward such a slogan: "Bravely pursue the truth! Firmly uphold the truth! But at the same time, bravely bow before the truth!" Having read its content, this slogan has indeed been put into practice.</p>
<p>Such a publication should, in theory, be welcomed by readers, just as readers welcomed "Eastern Miscellany" or "Shen Bao Monthly" before the war. However, with substandard publications flooding the cultural market today, one cannot help but worry whether its sales will be as ideally satisfactory. Just how far have our readers come? I think "Seeking Truth Magazine" can be used as a touchstone.</p>
<h3>The Story of an American Bestseller</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Regarding American bestsellers, the most interesting is the book "The Robe" written by Lloyd C. Douglas. In the two years since its publication, 1,545,000 copies have already been sold. The publishing company is busy buying paper and adding printing capacity. Readers are flocking to order, and even with added printing, there is still a shortage of 30,000 to 40,000 copies.</p>
<p>But speaking of the bestseller itself, critics believe that it has "no literary value." Its popularity is unrivaled among American books in recent years. It ranks fifth in sales among all American bestsellers. Some Hollywood film companies are willing to offer $100,000 to purchase the film rights to "The Robe." Later, several other film companies offered $1 million to buy it, but were rejected. The film companies are confident that after "The Robe" is made into a film, it will be a sensation in the film industry and will surely make a large profit.</p>
<p>In terms of literary achievement, "The Robe" is a failed work compared to any world masterpiece. However, if an average of five people read each copy of "The Robe," then at least six million Americans have read the book. You may say that the vision of a few people is not good, but you cannot say that the vision of six million people is not good or that their tastes are low. Furthermore, among the readers, most say that they were moved and stimulated, and were satisfied after reading it.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people believe that to become a bestseller, it should have two characteristics: the moral of the book is very lofty, and the writing style is very common. A book with these two characteristics is sure to be welcomed by most people.</p>
<p>Reading how the author started writing "The Robe" is a very interesting story. It turns out that Douglas went to a department store one day to buy something and chatted with a female clerk. The female clerk talked about the robe that Jesus wore when he was martyred, which was taken off by the Roman guards, and everyone gambled for it by throwing dice. She asked Douglas where that robe had gone and what happened to it. Douglas certainly didn't know, but after hearing this, he suddenly remembered that this subject could be used to write a novel. So after he left, he began to write. Unexpectedly, the female clerk unintentionally provided Douglas with the material for a bestseller.</p>
<p>In the American book industry, the largest sales are for textbooks in schools. For example, Noah Webster's spelling reader has sold over 100 million copies in the decades since its publication, and of course, no bestselling novel can compare to it.</p>
<p>In the past, no novel in America sold a million copies until Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was published in 1852, breaking the million-copy record. In the following years, no novel matched the sales of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" until 1875, when another bestselling novel appeared, Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer," which sold 1.5 million copies and whose sales have been long-lasting and continue to this day.</p>
<p>It is rare for a bestseller like Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer" to have lasting sales. Most American bestsellers only have strong sales for a few years after publication, and then quickly fade into obscurity. For example, one American bestseller with huge sales was Sheldon's "In His Steps." Today, ordinary readers have long forgotten it, and only people who study literature buy one or two copies out of curiosity. "In His Steps" was published in 1899, and the exact sales are unknown because its copyright system was not perfect. In addition to the original publishing company, a total of sixteen publishing companies later added printing, and it is estimated that the book sold at least eight million copies.</p>
<p>The second best-selling book is Gen Stratton Porter's "Freckles," which was published in 1904 and sold over two million copies. The third best-selling book is Lew Wallace's "Ben-Hur," published in 1880, which also sold almost two million copies. The fourth best-selling book is "A Girl of The Limberlost," also written by Porter, published in 1909, which sold a total of 1.6 million copies. The fifth best-selling book is "The Robe," mentioned above. As for the sixth best-selling books, there are two, one is Harold Bell Worth's "The Winning of Barbara Worth" (published in 1911), and the other is Margaret Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind." "The Winning of Barbara Worth" sold 1.5 million copies. "Gone with the Wind" was later adapted into a screenplay, so the exact sales are unknown, but they are roughly the same as "The Winning of Barbara Worth."</p>
<p>One point worth noting here is that among the six best-selling books mentioned above, three contain religious overtones. "In His Steps," "Ben-Hur," and "The Robe" all have a strong religious flavor. This does not mean that any novel, as long as it caters to the reader's psychology and adds some religious color, can successfully become a bestseller, but according to the experience of American booksellers, if a novel can adopt religious themes, it does help sales.</p>
<p>The special circumstances of the times also affect the sales of a book. For example, when "The Robe" was published, the American people were experiencing the outbreak of war, shattering the dream of peace. In sadness and disappointment, their souls needed comfort, and "The Robe" seized on this point, reducing the inner pain of readers, and thus gaining popular welcome. This is very similar to Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth." When "The Good Earth" was published, the American public was feeling bleak, hesitant, and fearful, holding an uneasy attitude towards the future, and needed encouragement and comfort. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth," with the simple Chinese peasants as the theme, depicted the tenacious and enterprising spirit of Chinese peasants who, relying on diligence and frugality, ultimately did not want to leave their homeland, which excited and encouraged the American public at that time.</p>
<p>Speaking of the author of "The Robe," Douglas had many famous works before, and their sales were very good, but not as good as "The Robe." The first was "Magnificent Obsession," published in the spring of 1932, which was listed as one of the bestsellers of that year, and began to attract the attention of booksellers and publishers. It was reprinted fifty times and sold 700,000 copies. It sold well in the United Kingdom and Canada, and was translated into several foreign languages.</p>
<p>"Magnificent Obsession" was Douglas's first novel. Speaking of how the author started writing it, like "The Robe," it is also a very interesting story. Douglas wrote it for preaching purposes. Every week at worship, instead of preaching like ordinary pastors, he read a section of the novel to everyone each time. As a result, this pastor-novelist not only made the listeners interested, but also wrote this famous novel over time. Following "Forgive Us Our Trespasses," "Precious Jeopardy," "Green Light," "White Banners," "Disputed Passage," "Home for Christmas," "Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal," "Invitation to Live," and "The Robe," Douglas then wrote a novel based on the life of Peter, entitled "The Big Fisherman."</p>
<p>Let's see what Douglas says about his writing experience. Perhaps in this place, we can understand a little of the secret of the success of American bestsellers.</p>
<p>Douglas once said, "In my novels, I simply write down my thoughts, what I want to say to the audience. I assume that my audience doesn't understand Christianity at all, and I want to try to explain it to them. I use simple language, vivid stories, and metaphors to illustrate the joy of living a Christian life."</p>
<p>Someone said, "If Douglas's novels were written better, so many readers would not have read them; if Douglas's novels were written worse, so many readers would not have wanted to read them." These two criticisms of American bestsellers are very accurate.</p>
