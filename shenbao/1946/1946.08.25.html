<h3>主席與馬特使晤談　交換當前和平問題意見　對改組政府事亦作商討</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿四日電〕馬歇爾特使夫婦，廿四日十一時牛赴行轅謁主席，作五登牯嶺後之首次晤談，並與主席夫婦共進午餐，聞馬使與主席曾就當前和平問題交換意見，內容未宣布。據此間一部份人士相信，祇要共黨能遵照主席八一四文吿，退出足以威脅重要交通綫（即津浦綫）及蘇北之重要據點，則和平談判即可繼續。馬特使座機已抵潯，渠一二日內即返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕近日京中和平商談，曾討論具體問題，即改組政府與停戰兩項，惟無結果。政府方面對主動的改組政府一事，頗具決心，馬特使前在牯時，曾與蔣主席就此問題作深入之交換意見，並曾電致周恩來，請共黨提出參加政府名單，馬特使由廬返京，國共美三方面循環接談後，共黨表示不拒絕討論改組政府一事，惟總統否決權等問題，與政府方面意見距離甚遠，且共黨稱：改組政府必須無條件停戰，即不談政府過去所提有關駐地問題之五點要求，商談旋即止於此處，馬帥五登匡廬，聞即以共黨此項意見轉達蔣主席，並有所協商。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕和平商談，因馬帥赴廬轉趨沉寂，司徒雷登大使廿四日整日無任何政治性會晤。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕馬歇爾特使思擬定一可以實行之計劃，以便建立一容納各黨派之國府委員會，委員計爲四十人。司徒雷登大使認爲整個問題應　予撇開，戰事應先全面停止，俾可完成全國休戰，產生國府委員會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿四電〕據美國方面人士稱：馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使，現正切實進行中國政府之改組工作。馬使堅主國府委員會應即成立，馬·司直接理涉和平問題之政治方面，尙係初次。馬使五上匡廬，其最大目標，在使蔣主席設立國府委員會。此項機構乃政治協商會議決定，用以代替最高國防委員會者。同時司徒大使現正籌設五人委員會，以謀恢復和平談判，該委員會除大使本人外，將包括政府及中共代表各兩人，中共領袖周恩來與董必武已同意參加原則上的談判，但政府方面未任命代表，中共發言人王炳南本日吿法國社記老稱：當前等待解決之問題僅有兩個，即（一）無條件停戰，（二）依照政協決議改組政府是也。此項原則如能實踐，則中共不僅將參加談判，且將參加政府之改組工作。以上兩問題，如能切實解決，中國前途將眞正趨於光明。岩石倘不移開，門戶即不能開啓。</p>
<h3>共軍不惜重大犧牲　再度攻大同未逞　守城國軍奮勇予以反擊</h3>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕大同外圍戰况仍甚激烈，惟連日被守城國軍之奮勇反擊下，共軍受創甚　，共軍近再由陽高增援萬餘人，附山砲十餘門，迫擊砲廿餘門，集結於大同以東之十里舖樊家莊等處，會合大同外圍之共軍再度進攻，自廿日晨起共軍在砲火掩護下，自大同東面分向沙岑水泉灣北岳廟等據點猛攻，發生激戰，至翌晨始被擊退，其北面之共軍，則同時向酒精公司麵粉公司警察學校等據點之國軍，分別于以包圍，並以密集之部隊，作波浪式之衝鋒，達七次之多，國軍誓死搏鬥，終將其擊退。另一部約一千餘，附山砲三門，由城北之臥虎彎白馬城等處，尚車站北端之國軍據點猛撲，經國軍奮勇反擊，其勢稍挫，現仍對峙中。在城西之十里店增到共軍二千餘，即將展開戰鬥。又進攻沙岑之共軍某團，其所部士兵因厭戰，將其團營長殺死，棄械逃散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十四日電〕正太路側石車站廿三日起共軍發動猛烈攻勢，現仍激戰中。</p>
<h3>攻鄒平共軍擊退</h3>

<h3>在舜生在滬談　政府改組問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨領袖會琦前赴牯嶺消夏，返京以後，因氣候失調，致患感冒，前晚由京抵滬，繼續療養。記者昨趨訪曾氏，適渠外出就醫，米獲接談，旋承左舜生氏接見，談及當前局勢。左氏認爲必先　戰實現和平，然後才能從政治方式尋求澈底解決途徑，關於此點渠頗同意中華時報八月十九日社論，就改組政府問題所提出之七項主張：（一）軍隊國家化與政治民主化，同時進行，以求逐漸達到預期的　的，（二）第一要蘇北停戰，（三）在蘇北確實辦到停戰以後，共軍即從蘇北自動退入山東，同時由雙方宣布全面停戰，（四）交通問題由國共，或加入其他方面及其他專家，合組一委員會，共同處理，雙方軍隊均退出沿鐵路綫若千里，幷規定一個時期，只以商運民運爲主，暫不運輸軍隊，（五）二，三，四，三點均確實辦到以後，即開始根據政協決議，進行改組政府，（六）政府改組後的第一項工作，爲根據雙方同意的整軍方案，澈底整軍，（七）政府改組後同時要進行的工作，爲重審憲草與召開國大。</p>

<h3>共軍憑籍工事頑抗　邵伯鎮展開巷戰　徐州外圍國軍收復沛縣</h3>
<p>〔本報江都廿四日電〕運　綫上，今竟日激戰，邵伯共軍於昨晚十一時，由高郵增到援軍千餘人？憑藉工事繼續頑抗，一度衝入鎭內，國軍旋即退守沿鎮河防，兩軍對峙，今日拂曉激戰再度展開，國軍發揮砲火威力，共軍傷亡重大，惟該處河流交錯，共軍在地形上佔有優勢，續有增援，堅持不退，下午二時國軍砲艦自邵伯湖發砲轟擊，繼之登陸，東面國軍亦經奮戰後，突破共軍陣地，再度衝入陣內，正面國軍亦乘勢自大王廟攻入，三路國軍分別與共軍展開巷戰，迄晚未己。</p>
<p>〔本報江都廿三日電〕蘇北大戰已揭開序幕，國軍被迫對威脅揚州之共軍，發動還擊，於今長五時半自他女廟附近，分兩路出擊，沿途民衆自動相助，所向披靡，右翼以橋墅爲第一目標，稍徑戰鬥於十一時許收復，該鎭共軍兩百餘名繳械受俘，傷亡亦衆，國軍僅傷亡十餘人，左翼進展勢如破竹，於迫抵邵伯近郊後，始遭共軍之堅强抵抗，共軍火力不足，惟工事堅固，尙圖頑抗，國軍已將邵伯三面圍住。又據晚九時仙女廟電，國軍已進入邵伯鎭內，共軍抵抗己擊破。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕據新華社淮陰廿三日電稱，運河水陡漲不已，淸江水位，至十八日止，已達二丈六尺六寸高，尙有續漲之勢，該電並稱如能開放歸江壩中之攔江掛山兩壩，即可免於難。記者據有關方面悉，該區水勢，顯係兵軍決堤所致，而該壩在高郵區爲共軍地域，何能嫁禍政府，更且渠高至一丈八尺，時歸江壩早已開放，何能至今猶强詞政府未曾開放，致釀巨災。</p>
<h3>東北局勢復緊張　林彪指示共軍積極備戰　熱河鐵路綫兩處有接觸</h3>

<h3>各地衝突情形　鄧局長招待記者報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防部新聞局，廿四日舉行記者招待會中，鄧局長文儀除報告衝突情形外，並答覆各記者詢問。記者詢以國共雙方之兵力如何，鄧稱國軍目前僅三百萬，新華日報則稱共軍有一千五百萬，上月中陳毅並對我王司令長官稱，即有五十萬人增援濟南，王氏答以兵在精而不在多，鄧旋謂共軍實際僅六十萬人，普日德國兵力達一千萬，日本亦擁五千萬，然均未制勝，可見兵貴精而不貴衆。有人詢以此種戰事，究將延至何時，鄧氏稱，決不會延長太久。旋又稱，汝等均年靑，可以靜觀演變，衆皆莞爾。最後鄧氏告記者，今後對戰况之發布，當力求于記者之便利，並循記者之請，對前往蘇北觀戰一事，允予考慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕國防部新聞局，廿四日下午四時在勵志社茶會招待新聞界，由局長鄧文儀主持，槪述各地面突情形，並解答問題多起。渠宣稱：共軍正積極布置在蘇北反攻，已自魯境調徐向前部二萬餘，隴海路調劉伯誠部七八萬，揚言「聲援蘇北」，似此則不久或有熱　可看。徐州方面：錫山，黃口收復後，逼近徐州共軍業已被驅遠退。氏並指出，徐州外圍共軍，不僅有日本裝備，且有日俘充當機槍砲手。隴海路方面，蘭封於廿二日下午二時收復，劉伯誠部卅一個團，已有十三個團經此次戰役殘破不堪。山西方面：大同仍在國軍英勇保衛中，鄧氏曾接獲城中守軍政治部電吿「有把握」三字。山東方面：共軍仍未放棄進攻靑島企圖，至於川陝邊境共軍約二千人，欲竄陝北，已被國軍切斷。綜觀戰局重心漸移蘇北，而該地共軍决堤阻止國軍之陰謀，因水退而成泡影，乃自大連調兵山東，增援蘇北，正向淮陰集中，窺其用意，無非欲盤據蘇北，以作協商時之籍口。鄧局長又痛陳共產軍暴行稱：共軍發動戰事以來，驅使「解放區」十五歲至四十五歲之男女參戰或運輸作戰時，强迫老百姓在前，以消耗國軍彈藥，用意至爲險毒，老百姓無戰鬥力，上陣即逃。隴海路黄河故道一帶人民，多因此逃散，無家可歸。又共軍毒刑曆出不窮，如「五馬分屍」及用水冲熱石灰，令人站於其中。據「解放區」逃出難民稱：「人民對共軍怨恨到極點，怕也怕到極點」，因動輒橫遭殺戮也。然物極必反，最近魯西各地人民自動組織抗共軍，魚台縣民萬餘人　起保衛家鄕，曾與蹂躪地方之共軍作戰，殺死共軍四百餘，隣縣金鄕人民萬餘，起而　應，刻魯省難民武裝還鄉運動日益發展，人心之向背，於此可知。「政府仍望中共懸崖勒馬，若仍一意孤行，殊堪痛惜」，渠繼以此　束其報吿。</p>

<h3>民盟張君勱張東蓀　籌組民主社會黨　蔣勻田談該黨基本主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訓〕民主同盟張者勱，張東蓀兩氏，近將其所領導之國家社會黨與海外民主憲政黨合併，改組爲民主社會黨，已成立組織委員會推張君勱，張東蓀，伍憲子，李大明，徐傳林，湯住心六人負責主持，將于日內發表宣言政綱。記者昨特趨謁該黨發言人蔣勻田，請詢組黨經過，及其基本主張。蔣氏談</p>
<p>組黨經過</p>
<p>謂民主憲政黨成立于遜清末季，其前身爲康有爲，梁啓超所組織之保皇黨，黨員均係海外僑胞，總部設于美國西雅圖，梁啓超逝世後，該黨由徐勤領導，繼後由伍憲子領導，以迄于今。該黨與國家社會黨之基本政治主張向甚接近，上年張君勱氏赴美出席舊金山會議，兩黨領袖晤談之後，即有合併改組之議，最近民主憲政黨李大明返國，經具體商討，遂決定合組社會民主黨，除原有兩黨黨員外，並有一部分致公黨黨員及社會賢達參加，（司徒美堂未加入）至本黨組成後與民主同盟關係如何，須俟三個月後，本黨召開全體代表大會時，始能正式決定，目前仍保持彼此合作的局面，以求達到民主的實現。</p>
<p>基本主張</p>
<p>至於本黨基本主張，在實行民主社會主義。社會主義的目的，當然在消滅憑藉財產以爲剝削的工具，但我們主張係用漸進的方式，透過議會立法租稅政策等，以求達此目標，一如英國工黨，對於於採用暴力政策，以求實現社會主義的方法，本黨不願加以考慮。本黨對於政治，主張實行直接選舉，每一政黨必須尊重選民的意見，誠意爲人民服務。至於地方政制，本黨認爲中國係單一國，應從地方自治入手，但其基本條件，在政治經濟各方面，中央政府應絕對予以尊重。對於目前過渡時期之國內政治，本黨完全擁護政協決議，希望早日實現和平統一。在改組政府方面，本黨爲國共雙方必先停戰，從和平中求統一以消滅國共間的一切問題，以求達到政治民主化。在整編軍隊方面，本黨絕對主張軍隊國家化，全國軍隊一律用於國防，抵禦外侮，政黨不得私有軍隊。渠並申述目前國內局勢如長久打下去，不但社會系統紊亂，財政經濟也無法維持，爲要保持勝利後的國際地位，更須迅速停戰。至於有人主張中國問題擬提請聯合國安理曾共同解決一點，吾人認爲實無此需要，故不贊同，因馬歇爾特使來華調解，即係根據莫斯科三國會議決定之原則也。記者詢以政府如改組，該黨是否準備參加，渠稱：在解決國內糾紛有裨和平大局之原則下，願加考慮。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中國代表團對和會的貢獻</h3>
<p>巴黎和會自誕生以來，快要慶賀「彌月」了。但在這二十多天中，我們只聽到廿一國的代表的宏論，以及義，芬，羅，匃，保，五國代表陳述對和約的意見，和會進展的遲緩，幾乎令人不可想像。最近幾天來，各種委員會雖都在開會，但還沒有獲得顯著的進展，而聯合國大會又定於下月中旬舉行，如果在聯合國大會開慕之前，不能完成對義，芬，羅，匃，保五國的和約，則這兩個有同樣重要的國際會議，勢難同時在巴黎與紐約開會，不是和會暫時休會，就是聯合國大會延期舉行。所以在這個時候，和會實有加緊工作的必要。</p>
<p>我國代表團在巴黎和會中，雖因這五國和約與中國沒有直接利害關係，很少發言，也不願多所主張，但看到各國意見的龐雜紛歧，各國代表對草案所提出的修正案又堆積如山，如果都要提出討論，不但浪費時間，而且各國代表勢將辯論到唇焦舌敝，我代表團團長王世杰氏，乃與比利時，巴西，加拿大，荷蘭等國代表聯名，　於對義和約草案序文，提出了一個修正案，主張在序文中讚揚義大利民主份子反抗法西斯政體之功績，獲得出席和會各國代表的好評。我國代表團並在巴黎發表聲明稱：「巴黎和會與中國國家利益，雖非直接有關，但中國代表團對於和會工作，表示極大關切，本代表團將努力貢獻於一切重大問題之公平解決。蓋以巴黎和會之談判及其所懷精神，將成爲另一會議之先例，日本之命運即在該另一會議中決定。」</p>
<p>和會對政治及領土委員會於前天開會，將中國修正案提出討論，修正案原文有曰：「盟軍得義大利人民中之民主份子的協助，獲得勝利之後，義大利法西斯政體即於一九四三年七月廿五日被推翻，義國乃無條件投降，並於同年九月三日及廿九日簽訂停戰協定。……」而對義和約草案的原文則爲：「義國法西斯政體在軍事壓迫之下，於一九四三年七月廿五日被推翻，義國旋即無條件投降，並接受同年九月三日及廿九日所簽訂之停戰協定。……」我國代表並起立發言，說明中國代表提出此項修正案的目的，乃在讚揚義國人民反抗法西斯政體之功績。言畢，立即獲得美國與法蘭西的附議，並獲得委員會一致通過。</p>
<p>這次巴黎和會，不論是全體大會，或是各種委員會開會，從未有像那天通過中國修正案這樣順利。就我國代表團而言，這確是他們參加和會的一大成功。按王外長啓程赴巴黎之前，曾發表談話，說明中國對於和會的態度：（一）此行目的在促成和會的成功；（二）一切提案，凡足以加强世界永久和平基礎者，中國必予以支撑，換言之，國際正義即爲世界永久和平之、主要基礎；（三）一切領十爭執，應以民族主義爲解决之最高原則；（四）聯合國所給予其敵國之和平，必須避免一切不必要與含有危險性之條件。王外長出席和會首次發表演說，亦以此爲言？並曾公開宣言，義大利在戰爭末期所有貢獻，應予以合理的承認。這次提川修正案，獲得委員會的一致通過，也可以說是王外長的成功，貫澈了他的主張。</p>
<p>我國因爲地理上的障礙，在這次大戰中，雖未直接參加歐洲戰區的戰事，但我國是反侵略的先鋒，首先揭起反法西斯的大旗，並牽制了日本百萬大軍，陷於中國的泥沼，使其不能參加歐開戰事，協助德國作戰，所以中國至少可以說是間接參加歐洲的國家。波茨坦會議時，三巨頭也曾宣言和約應由英美法蘇中五國所組織之外長會議起草，但中國對於和約沒有直接利害關係，對於和約的起草工作，始終未加過問。這次我國代表提出修正案，並非對於義大利有特殊的好感，也不是因爲我國另有別種企圖，而純出於促成和會成功的動機。澳洲代表比斯萊向我國代表道賀稱：「和約的內容，將不爲四國外長會議所擬就的草案所拘束，殊堪慶幸。」這句話，意義深長，値得各國代表深思的。</p>
<p>展望和會的前途，因爲各國代表的利害不一致，難題重重，大半是不容易解決而需要從長計議的問題。所以在目前，很難望巴黎和會在最短期間獲得迅速進展。我國代表團在巴黎，仍應一本初衷，繼續努力，看淸了各國間矛盾的裂縫，隨時補苴缺漏，提出合乎國際正義的修正案，俾對於和會的成功，，有所貢獻。此不但有助於歐洲政治的澄淸，而且對於遠東局勢將來的發展，也有極大的關係。巴黎和會如不幸而失敗，則其影響所及，足使遠東和會遙遙無期，而對日和約更無由順利產生了。</p>

<h3>南斯拉夫色厲內荏　美陸長柏德遜怒吼　謂美軍應隨時出動作戰　準備幹一下　美陸長柏德遜</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕美致南斯拉夫之最後通牒，廿四日已吿滿期，南斯拉夫政府廿三日於貝爾格勒正式廣播，謂蒂托元帥決拒絕答覆美國之最後通牒，認爲該項通　毫無需要，因被迫降落南境之美機人員早已於二十二日釋出也。其實南國此種態度，不過爲外強而中乾，據法國新聞社分析，蒂托元帥雖己表示拒絕答覆最後通牒但在事實上南國已應其要求：第一，美國飛機於本月九日被迫降落者，所有飛行員及乘客，均已釋放且准其返抵交界處，第二，美國當局已獲許可前往出事地點勘察木月十九日被擊落美機之遣骸，第三據美駐南斯拉夫大使柏德遜來電報吿南國政府已允許將竭盡其所能，設法阻止再發生類似之事件，此外，又悉蒂托元帥已命令戰鬥機之飛行員，避不射擊飛渦南國領空之外國飛機。在另一方面，美陸長柏德遜，二十三日在波士頓向美國軍團大會致辭，對南斯拉夫擊落美機事表示異常憤慨，渠謂，南國乃吾人之盟邦，其得有今日之地位者，泰半係因吾國源源不絕之供應，但該盟邦今竟故意擊落我機，又復强辭奪理，自不能不令每一美國人感覺憤慨。並謂，美國務須擁有訓練有素之軍隊，準備隨時奉令出戰。</p>
<h3>第二架美機下落　爲問題癥結所在</h3>
<p>査美國最後通牃中所要求者，計有兩項一爲釋放木月九日被迫降落之美機中之全部人員，一爲由美方派員與第二架被擊落美機中墜地未死之人員取得聯絡，並即予以釋放。現第一事己吿完滿解決，所餘者不過爲第二事而已。美代理國務卿艾克遜廿三日於華盛頓招待記者會中聲明，美國對於此事尙未能滿意，必須俟第二架美機中人員下落之確實消息，獲得以後，方能考慮最後之意見。至於美國此後是否仍將此案提付聯合國安全理事會，艾克遜亦未明白宣示，僅請記者注意美國照會內容，謂美國將根據證據及南斯拉夫之行動，決定此後步驟，以糾正其錯誤。可見目前問題之癥結所在，已只在被擊落第二架美機之如何下落矣。</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫重行反攻　外交戰嚴重化</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕每日郵報載巴黎消息稱：南斯拉夫已決定將美國侵犯南國領空之事件一百六十起，提出聯合國機構，此舉乃與美國之行動相對抗。又據路透社消息：南國並將向聯合國機構提出申訴，以抗議美國之扣留南國船舶。此種行動顯然已使戰後最嚴重之外交衝突，益趨複雜。南斯拉夫對美國之控訴，係向聯合國秘書長賴依提出，要求將「美佔領軍當局無理扣留多瑙河內南國船舶」之專列入議程。據出席聯合國機構南斯拉夫代表稱：南國僅請社經理事會討論多璃河航行問題，就彼所知，南斯拉夫致聯合國機構函中，並未提及美國。</p>

<h3>關於對義和約序文　我修正案獲通過　註明義民主分子公績</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞让巴黎廿三日電〕關於中國代表團對於對義和約草案序文所提出之修正案，即主張在序文中贊揚一義大利民主份子反抗法西斯政體之功績一案，已於廿二日由對義大利政治及領土委會一致矛以通過。委會討論序文第一段，列舉對義和約簽字各國之名稱，未經討論即爲會議一致通過。旋即討論第二段，義代表欲加以修正，主張法四斯政體與義人民對於戰爭之責任，應有所區別，乃引起長時間之辯論。最後荷蘭代表提出修正案，主張以「義大科作戰」代替「義大利宣戰」付諸表決，以十一票對九票之多數予以通過。旋即討論第柜段，各國代表紛紛自動打消其所提出之修正案，以便利中國代表所提出之修正案。比利時巴西加拿大荷蘭曁南斯拉夫五國代表一致表示附議。中國代表之修正案原文有曰，「盟軍得義人民中民主份子，正協助獲得勝利之後，義大利法西斯政體即於一九四三年七月廿五日被推翻，義國乃無條件投降，並於同年九月三日及廿九日簽訂停戰協定……」，而對義和約草案原文則爲「義國法西斯政體在軍事壓迫之下，於一九四二年七月廿五日被推翻，義國旋即無條件投降，並接受同年九月三日及廿九日所簽訂之停戰協定……」。中國代表起立發言，說明此項修正案之目的，乃在讚揚義人民反抗法西斯政體之功統，美法兩國代表一致表示贊同。澳代表比斯萊乃起立發言，向中國代表表示祝賀之意，幷謂，關於和約內容，和會己不爲四國外長會議所擬定之草案所拘束。蘇代表維辛斯基聞言，深表詫異，並云中國修正案與和約草案原文，並無重大出入之處，第一段大致相同，至於第二段讚揚義人民反抗法西斯政體之功績，向爲蘇聯代表所贊同，英代表麥克尼爾所見見從同，中國修正案乃經委員會一致通過。至此委員會乃宣佈散會，至下星期一繼續開會。</p>
<h3>日本積極準備　和平條件談判</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿二日電〕據消息靈通人土稱二日政府對於將來和平條件之談判，正作積極之準備。蓋以盟國不擬對日本安排和約，此種信念日益加甚。外務省己召集外交界前輩，每星期舉行會議一次，從長討論當前外交政策及國際關係問題。自下月起更將擴大會議範圍，邀請社會各方而負責人士參加。政治領袖五人，包括進步領袖犬養健在內（但共黨除外），敎授三人。藝術家數人，新聞記者及其他人一士，將與外務省要員會議，檢討國際時局之演變，而就日外交政策之動向交換意見。據接近外務省人士談稱，此種會議對於舉行和平會議並無直接影響，但消息靈通人士指出官方實言不由衷。</p>
<h3>麥帥指定工廠五百所　充日本賠償之用　顧大使與美談判日賠償問題</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕據麥帥總部外事局特別發表，麥帥總部今日下令保管日本產業八部門之五百五所工廠，此乃對日中間賠償計劃之第二段措置。此次被指定之產業部門，爲工作機械。製鐵廠·火力發電·倍林·蘇打粉·氯及苛性納·造船·琉酸·民間兵工廠·又此次指定係根據遠東委員會所核准之賠償目標及選擇工廠之標準。至於航空機廠及研究所，則早已作爲中間賠償計劃第一段措置而被指定。麥帥總部經濟科學局工業部畏李蒂就此事發表談話，謂此刻聯合國方面未有一國實際指定拆去某一工廠，此事須俟將來決定。第八軍司令官得指示有效保管指定工廠，及於特定工廠之拆去未有最後決定以前，准許爲達到佔領目的認爲必需之工廠繼續開工。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿四日電〕麥帥總部今日第二次指定將來充作賠償之日本工廠後，應行拆除之工廠設備，其全體規模業已完全明瞭。按麥帥總部先於一月二十日下令保管飛機廠，陸海軍工廠·研究所等合計三九四所，以充賠償之用，其後於五月三十日略有追加削除，成爲五九四所，加上今日發表之五〇五所，總計一〇九九廠。日本戰時存在之軍需工廠，殆已網羅無遺，其數占日全部工廠三分之一。此項工廠將用以復興遭日軍破壞之各國工業。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿廿四日電〕日對賠償問題之談判，重心不在東京而在華府，現由顧大使主持，與美國務院洽商中。盟國要求我方提出因日本侵略而發生之損失淸單以便精密確定賠償數額。現悉此項資料業已送去一部份，但淸單完成尙需相當時日，聞美方對我國要求有優先償權一點，表示同情。關於東北工業因蘇軍之搬移所發生之損失，應如何加以補僨，因性質不單純，目前尙談不到，有資格人士認爲遠東對日賠償問題，須於明年舉行之遠東和會中求得總解決。</p>
<h3>美潛艇部隊　在北極海演習</h3>
<p>〔中央社檀香山廿三日合衆電〕美潛艇隊曾在西伯利亞與阿拉斯加北極海面間，舉行爲期一月之演習。美潛水艇五艘上月自美國北駛至荷蘭港普利俾羅夫羣島及聖羅稜士島，並經白令海峽抵北極海，其中四艘直駛至北緯七十度。美海軍潛艇隊司令麥凱恩稱，演習係「練習性質」，旨在使海軍官員及海員熟悉北極海之環境，此非爲作戰，亦非爲針對任何特殊國家。</p>
<h3>麥帥允許日人　南冰洋捕鯨　英挪向美抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕國務院最近曾自陸軍部接獲麥克阿瑟之建議依據日本組織捕鯨隊，　非日籍專家監督之下，前往南冰洋從事捕鯨，所有鯨油　回日本，安爲儲藏。茲據國務院方面今日稱：英國及挪威對於麥帥之此項建議，已提出口頭抗議。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦問題　愈趨複雜微妙　英國處境進退兩難</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕此間關係方面嚴稱：巴勒斯坦之動亂將使軍隊延遲復員，並使英國耗費金錢及生命，此項代價，若非用以購取和平安全與好意，實屬不合理之至。且巴勒斯坦局勢動盪之不定，更足使英國遭受各方面之指責。英國現正遭受猶太阿拉伯及美國三方面之壓迫，因此己有一部份人感覺，不如由他人前來解決巴勒斯坦問題，然此乃一時氣憤之辭。</p>
<p>從軍略上觀點　英視爲生命綫</p>
<p>爲帝國交通及世界安全，英實不能遽即放棄巴勒斯坦。最近英埃談判之停頓，足以表示帝國軍略計劃之重要，退出埃及之決定具有政治動機，英國軍略計劃家之不示反對者，以巴勒斯坦南部堪爲中東新基地之故。吾人已母庸指出紅海—蘇　士運河—地中海之帝國生命綫，無論在戰時或平時，對於英國具有如何之重要性。英國放棄埃及以後，其在東地中海之據點，僅希臘。塞浦魯斯。巴勒斯坦三處。希臘之政局欠安定，而塞島則覺太小，故巴勒斯坦乃理想之防禦中心。</p>
<p>確保對阿友誼　中東安全所</p>
<p>表面上，猶太族似不致拒絕英國之安全計劃，英國若能允許猶太族之要求，則猶太族常願意以基地便利等供給英國，阿拉伯族或亦願作同樣之讓步，然以埃及爲前車之鑒，則至相同時期，恐阿拉伯族仍不免提出英人退出之要求。英美輿論，今已迫使英政府不得不注意猶太族之呼聲，然阿拉伯族對於英政府之未會設法制止猶人移人，已表示異常憒慨，英國之中東政策，旣部份以阿拉伯聯盟爲據，故對於此等情形，當不能視若無睹。中東之安全，繫於是否能與阿拉伯世界保持友誼，阿拉伯聯盟已一再表示，決支持巴勒斯坦之阿拉伯族，此間若干官員並恐英國若將彼等之呼聲置之不理，則阿拉伯世界有傾向莫斯科之可能。除軍事問題外，巴勒斯坦尙牽涉海空交通及石油等重要物資之供應問題</p>
<p>欲求計劃實現　需要美國援助</p>
<p>再就美國方面言，英國亦不敢忽視美國之意見，蓋巴勒斯坦計劃，終須得聯合國機構之通過，苟無美國之助，通過勢不可能。一方面阿拉伯國家在聯合國內有六國之多，外約但若再參加，則將增至七國，在大會席上其有相當之力量，故目前英國之處境，已陷人兩難之境矣。</p>
<h3>多瑙河航運　美國闡明政策</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜對記者答覆關於多瑙河上船隻問題之現狀時稱：臨近多瑙河之各國，現均不願意任其管制之船隻駛出該河之若干地段。渠指出美國會宣佈，美國願與有關各國討論開放多瑙河之航運問題，使臨近該河之各國，能恢復其正常之經濟生活，蘇聯政府曾向奧國與匃牙利扣留若干船隻，其所持之理由，爲此等船隻有德國所有權之嫌疑，在奧國佔領區內有若干船隻大槪爲個人之財產，或屬於奧國以外其他國家政府之所有。艾氏稱，船隻問題僅爲多瑙河上整個航海問題之一部份。美國會屢次設法討論此事，渠曾接得報吿謂，聯合國秘需曾接獲南斯拉去政府一函，請求在經社理事會中討論駛船隻問題，但渠並未目睹該函。</p>

<h3>建設大上海都市計劃會成立　計劃時期以五十年需要爲準備推定土地交通區劃等七組委員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市都市計劃委員會，昨日下午三時，在市府會議室舉行成立大會，並召開首次會議，出席者兼主任委員吳國楨，當然委員趙　康，祝平·趙曾珏·張維，谷春軓·吳開先（李劍華代）顧毓琇（李熙謀代），聘任委員奚玉書，黃伯樵，李慶麟，施孔懷，薛次莘，陸議受，范文照，梅貽琳，盧樹森，徐國懋，錢乃信，王志莘等卅餘人，參議會議長潘公展列席</p>
<h3>主席致詞希望表面實際工作同時並進</h3>
<p>首由吳國　主席略稱：都市計劃委員會，原由內政部所規定，各省各市都應設立，所以今天上海市都市計劃委員會宣吿成立，本人是極爲愉快的。上海在過去始終未曾有過整個具規模的都市計劃，有之，也僅及於市中心區而已。雖然過去之舊英法兩租界，不能不承認其有相當成績，但是一切設施都無計劃的。爲了確立今後都市建設之標準，及目前施政應有之準繩，必須有個大綱規定，如將全市劃分成商業區，住宅區，碼頭區等，都應事先規劃，然後求其逐步實現。所以都市計劃委員會，對表面工作及實際工作，必須同時並進。今日到會的都是專家，相信對今後的大上海都市計劃，必能有極大的貢獻，本人願致最大歡迎之意。嗣由趙祖康宣讀由內政部營建司司長哈雄文氏代內政部張部長所發致大會之電文，大意爲祝都市計劃委員會成功。</p>
<p>潘議長致詞</p>
<p>旋由參議會議長潘公展致詞：略謂市參議會召開期將届，現已積極收集有關市政建設之意見，故對於上海市都市計劃委員會的成立，極爲愉快。關於一切都市之建設，倘若祗顧目前，而不展望將來，是不合理的，大而言之，國家之建設，亦復如是，當初國父手擬建設大綱時，對當時之環境而言，亦未嘗不可說是太偏重理想，然而現在看來，却是最値得研究的具體計劃。上海市都市計劃，並非僅屬三年五年之計劃，而應該是三十年五十年之計劃。戰前上海被分成好幾個勢力範圍，但今天已經統一了，所以深望上海市都市計劃委員會能擬定好的方案，然後分期逐漸促其實現。民意機關希望今天的會議，是都市計劃的開始，並祝成功。</p>
<p>討論重要提案</p>

<h3>韓人軍火資敵案偵查屆最後階段　孫田昌值已難逃罪第四醫院查無弊賣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕孫田昌植軍火資敵案，速日經淸査團積極偵查，孫本人亦由張慶楨委員五度傳詢，密吿人及孫皆曾提供證據，故該案之發展已屆最後階段，昨午後淸査團張慶積·范爭波·吳望伋三委員再度覆査孫田昌植在西摩路之倉庫及於敵僞時期內遭孫覇佔之謀得利琴廠。據張委員稱：該案之成立，已無疑義。蓋孫之與敵酋交往，代敵承造軍火獻飛機等事實，孫雖狡點，但在對刑法素有硏究之張委員前，終難遁形，故於五次詰詢中，孫已無法狡賴。另據吳望伋委員談：孫所提之反證多而且精確，渠確爲一科學家，即二十年前之購物發票，迄尙保存。淸査團現正命其繳出各種機器購賣時之發票，及營業賬册，以憑査究。至於市立第四醫院，昨經淸查團張權幹事會同衛生局技正曹勳·科長彭運鹍共同淸査結果，並未發現有舞弊情事。故該檢舉案認爲不能成立。另悉淸査團對密吿案件仍予接受，該團並計劃赴杭州·紹興·寗波·吳興等處工作，唯五十天之期限實嫌過短，據該團張慶植委員表示，延期已成必然之勢云。</p>

<h3>參觀逸仙號軍艦禁不住感慨回憶</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕逸仙號軍艦歸來了。因爲在二十日那一天，日人奉麥帥總部的命令，將它從吳軍港送回了祖國。現在泊在江南造船所江面。</p>
<p>「逸仙」是我國海軍第一艦隊的一艘輕巡洋艦，而爲十六年江南造船所自己的產物。當八一三滬戰爆發以後，它便被派在江陰要塞，後來逸仙號終於被炸沉在江陰附近的長江裏。</p>
<p>國軍向西轉移陣地以後、日軍便把炸沉在長江底下的逸仙艦打撈了起來，擄赴日本：當記者昨天坐着五呎長的小舟去訪問，在江面上重見逸仙號的時候，禁不住的回憶與感慨。</p>
<p>從江上一眼望去，逸仙艦已面目全非。新抹上的淡淡的鐵灰色油漆，掩不住艦舷上的處處傷痕。尤其是船尾上已經添造了一間艦艙，像一枚贅疣般的刺目。</p>
<p>舢板傍了艦，副艦長安國祥接了我們進客廳去，接着又伴着四處逛了逛。如此，我對艦艙的內部獲得了取初的一個印象：緊凑。小，是的，處處地方都覺得狹窄。然而，使你覺得它極緊凑，簡潔，樸實。全艦長二七一呎，闊卅四呎，吃水十二呎，重一五〇〇噸。當然不能與高而又大的美艦相比，但它是我國自造的軍艦，是新海軍的起始，也是歷盡艱險的老戰士。雖然小，它却是我們的榮譽，我們的驕傲。</p>
<p>宓副長是個熱情刻苦的湖南靑年，據他陪着參觀時吿訴記者：船頭上原有一尊六吋口徑砲，船尾上有尊五吋半的，美軍佔領日本，解除艦船武裝，把它們一古腦兒沉入了太平洋中。日本海軍把「逸仙號「擄去以後，把它改成了練習艦，尾部還添造了一間艙房，作敎室之用，便是先前見那個贅疣。</p>
<p>我們自艦前部的所謂「最上甲板」，按層盤登，到了頂層。其間一共有四層，順序上去，是：（一）電訊室與航行時休息室，（二）操縱室（即通常的艦橋），（三）露天的最頂層，這裏安置着一具測距儀。艦橋是半密封式，設備也極簡單，一具磁盤也只是普通有磁差的一種，並非旋轉儀。從上至下，各種儀器配備，有一特點，全是日貨，而有機密性的器械裝置，俱已在發還前被先行拆除。</p>
<p>我們在頂層時，會見了剛公畢來晤的任光海艦長。任艦長是福建人，辛亥武昌起義，便已在海軍中，是位老前輩，略略寒喧了幾句，我們就攝了張照。據任艦長說：全船原需水兵一百六十人，官員二十三人，差可應付，現在因人才缺乏，總共只百來個人，大家因此便忙了一點，工作相當緊張。</p>
<p>逸仙艦似乎是中國新海軍的一個雛型。瘦小侷促，這是無庸諱言的，但是只要能保持着這種緊張刻苦的精神，我想也許這些吃水淺，噸位小的艦艇，就是中國五千浬海岸綫的保衛者之曙光。（前圖係逸仙號全貌本報攝）</p>
<h3>四期學警結業禮市長訓詞期望兩點　注意改善交通負責取締攤販</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市警察局警察訓練所昨晨八時在平凉路操塲舉行第四期學警結業典禮，吳市長宣警局長俱親臨致訓。八時許結業式開始，當吳市長率警局各長官步入大操塲時，首由學警總隊長潘鏡趨前報吿結業式人數，計男生三百名，女生六十名，又訓練所敎職員九十六人，嗣呉市長檢閱學警一週後，即登司令台。斯時樂隊齊嗚，學警列隊環塲巡行一匝，後循司令台成密集隊形，靜待聽訓。結業典禮主席爲俞叔平副局長，行禮如儀並報吿後，即請市長致訓。</p>
<p>吳市長訓辭，語多勗勉，略誚：警察負着市政最大責任，百分之八十的事務都與警察有關。同時，警察代表着政府的威信，因此他的是否自尊自重，在在影響着人民對政府的信仰。吳市長並對學業的學警提出目前上海最急迫的問題：（一）交通問題，市長本身時常因中區交通擠塞而延遲時問，希望畢業學警能注意此點，並硏究改進之方。（二）取締攤販，市長說：「最初以爲大多數係難民，因此對此種小本經營不忍取締。經三個月的研究後，始知事實上並非完全如此。這種攤販，賣的是洋貨，罐頭等等，其中尤以碼頭上盜竊而來的柬西爲多，若容許他們的存在，無異是助長竊盜之風。市長並指出九月一日以後，除香烟小吃以外撫販，一槪嚴厲取締，違者沒收，這種種執行責任，便在各學警們身上。</p>
<p>繼由宣局長致詞，略謂：經騐應與學識並重，今日畢業係講堂課程的吿一段落，並非說警察知識今後即無須再學習。宣局長並大聲疾呼，警惕地指出上海的環境髒骯汚穢，壞的不易變好，好的却容易變壞。他說，「這裏前後左右，無一不是聲色利誘，意志倘不堅決，很容易地就給社會吃掉，因此我們要堅定意志，改造社會，使上海大放光明，成爲復興中國的嶄新都市。」旋由結業學警代表趨司令台前致答詞，對吳市長及各官長訓詞表示誠意接受，並保證願以此懸爲鵠的，身體力行。末由主席對刑事，交通，等六班優秀學生十八名給獎，結業典禮，於焉完成。（結業禮照片載第八版）</p>
<h3>警察局普查家犬曾否訓練技能若何豢養目的亦須詳塡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市警察局，秉其鐵芥不遺之精神，近已決定對守戶之犬，亦加以戶籍調査之殊遇。凡愛犬之士，首須將其本人之姓名，性別，年齡，籍貫，職業，一一詳報當局，繼卽將該大種別，年齡，犬主養犬原因，該犬是否受過訓練，訓練時期若干，該犬技能若何，逐項註明，塡具表格。而最有興趣之一點，則爲每表有長一寸半闊半吋之空白地位，專供犬主陳述其愛犬能力之梗槪。如畜犬適巧妙如玲丁丁者，則此主人當不知何處下筆矣。</p>
<p>至於「養犬目的」一項，亦爲本市人士所極感興趣。養犬之目的果何如？古語謂「犬爲人之良友，」不知如此塡法，警局又以爲何如？聞該表必須一式塡列二份，而爲領取該犬銅牌之費用，又須納費法幣一千六百元。塡表截止期間，祇餘七天，若犬主於七天內不予注意或吝此一千六百元者，則該犬當被擯於合法社會之外，聽侯警局嚴厲之處分。</p>
<h3>天下一家獲獎人美作家周游列國　考溫來華昨日招待新聞界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕獲得「威爾基天下一家飛行　」之第一人美著名新聞家及出版家諾門考溫氏最近來華，昨日上午十時在市府大禮堂舉行記者招待會。考溫身材頎長，目御眼鏡，發言淸晰有力。氏於戰時對於文化工作貢獻甚多，廣播方面尤具才幹，已故羅斯福總統之廣播程序大多由彼主持，其作品且爲全美七百多家電合之經常節目，昨由國際宣傳處魏景蒙氏陪同出席並略作介紹後，即起立發表談話。略稱美國人民是當有理想之人民，此不獨在立國基礎之憲法及人權宣言中表現無遺，即以南北戰爭而論，亦係爲一理想面戰。而威爾基「天下一家」之著作尤爲　國人民之理想觀點作一明證。威爾基於一九四二年或際形勢最爲惡劣之時週遊列國，以其所遇所見寫成「天下一家」一書報吿於人民。其中關於中國之部份特別令人感動。</p>
<p>招待記者之考溫氏（本報攝）</p>
<p>威爾基雖　志而沒，但其友人決繼其遺志爲實現其理想而努力。余個人遊歷二十餘國，最近來至中國，所見情形有好有壞。余所得結論爲目前人類歷史上空前未有之中心問題，係如何求得國家內部及國與國間之團結，蓋任何事協調甚難而分裂極易，我人必須尋求一種「技術」以達成「天下一家」之理想，而此種「技術必須」反過去之窠臼，余曾在韋勃斯脫字典上査閱「外交」一詞之意義，其解釋爲「以技巧獲得利益而不招致惡意及戰爭」。此種解釋決已不適用於今日，我人應予「外交」之新定議爲「以技巧樹立國家之信譽」。我人所需之「技術」又如此室中之冷氣，所以減低國際間猜忌紛爭之熱浪。此種技巧必須迅予求覓，否則必將招致世界之不幸。考溫詞畢由各記實提出間　　問，氏　　國際文化藝術之交流。對於增進國際合作甚有帮助，對於最近中國音樂之日趨西化，則深表惋惜，並希望西方音樂亦能東方化，對於美國孤立主議派之存在，氏稱此次戰爭當已予彼等極佳之敎訓。按考溫氏在此次旅行中已得有英首相，波總理，瑞典親王，埃及皇帝，印度尼赫魯等以及各國作家記者礦工等關於「天下一家」意見之錄音，在中國亦將搜集此項資料，並將以其作品譯成中文後公開廣播。氏已定於後日進京云。</p>

<h3>紡建開會期間棉紗黑市竟暴漲　部長謂紡建決維持原價公司謂不顧社會之抨撃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市復暴漲，客帮採辦頗湧，然市上現貨奇缺，不惜放價以求，各支紗綫一跳十萬元，尙屬供不數求，査昨日狂升之原因乃各紗廠堅執不賣所致，因不願遵照當局意旨，照外匯未調整前之市價開貨，復不敢甘冒不薦，照黑市供給，於是現貨籌碼益缺，客帮及布廠競相吸納矣。</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司於昨日下午三時，召開第八届董監事會議。經濟部長王雲五，及次長潘序倫，均親自出席主持。會議至七時廿分，始吿竟事。會後玉部長就各報社記者所提詢之諸問題，分別解答。茲分別臚陳如後：</p>
<p>王部長談方案未定</p>
<p>此次紡建　監事會議，主要課題，厥爲如何抑平紗布價格，今日歷數小時之討論，尙未具體定論；蓋尙須與紡織事業管理委員會會商，紡建生產紗布所用之原棉，亦有取給於外洋方面者，故匯率調整結果，對紗布生產成本，不無影響。惟紡建當局，決儘力維持原價不漲。</p>
<p>（二）對紡建派貨多少問題，王部長聲明在物價稍形波動時，申請配購者，紛至沓來，且申請量又吿激增。在需求無限，生產有限之情形下，紡建當不得不分別緩急先後，予以合理之支配，決無乘紗布市價高漲之時，减少配售數量之事，且紗布究與糧食之性質不同，紗布之需要量，頗具伸縮性，故嚴重性較糧食問題爲次。</p>
<p>（三）紡建總經理束雲章，方視察靑島天津各地紡建所屬工廠，據上月報吿，該兩地區分廠之生產數量，較前已增加百分之卅。</p>
<p>（四）關於紗布出口事宜，經部顧到兩點：（甲）可與國外各地易貨，例如越南之米煤，頗有意與我紗布易貨，（乙）南洋華僑對祖國紗布，頗感需要，正可利用此時機，以樹立國產紗布在南洋之市塲，故對紗布出口整個方案，經部方在考慮中。</p>
<p>公司表示勢將漲價</p>
<p>聯合　信所訊，昨據紡建吳副總經理味經談：一週以來，拋出之布，達廿萬疋以上，紗爲二萬餘包，而全國老百姓，並未得受實惠，僅上海少數份子，於一張棧單開出後，不要本錢，即可獲非份之利，此種現象，實不合理，政府維持限價之辦法，不啻獎勵投機，凡一政策之實施，需各方共同維護，中紡目前力量尙小，其他廠商如不合作，採取同一步驟，則黑市胃口之大，實無法應付，公司唯有不顧社會之抨擊，以機動方式，斟酌市塲實際情形，考慮配價之增减。</p>
<p>開貨辦法或將改善</p>
<p>據紡織業某君稱，日來中紡掛牌站定，而民營紗廠，猶以黑市出售，某負責者，正在考慮將國營民營紗廠之出貨，統一支配云，又稱販賣商號，及外埠客帮之開貨資格，或將重行甄別，廠家亦將依其生產機能，審査其派貨之資格，並管理其成品之售價。</p>
<h3>債市又掀起狂潮　統丙收後喊出二千大關負責當局似應有所表示</h3>
<p>公債因連朝報載對戰前債務之處理，頗多議論，引起各種幻想，昨業中蠢動復起，五棋與七樓有數家大戶，連袂活動，買氣突熾，統丙晨開即昂騰爲一四〇〇元，開後買方一再爭購，扶搖直上，而以一八八〇元買價結束，結果較前收猛漲七四〇元，收後且繼續喊高至二〇五〇元左右，爲狀熱烈萬分，甲乙自七七〇元哄高一〇〇〇元有零，統戊自一一五〇元扳高至一六〇〇元結束，結果較前收計甲乙好四〇元，丁升五百元左右，戊種亦漲六八〇元。</p>
<h3>金鈔穩定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨更爲呆滯，晨開二一七萬，高價未越二一七萬五，浮多把握不住，紛有了結，不久即逐漸回小，十時後，央行以二一五萬五之價，配售一四七條，此際最低亦未破二一五萬五，嗣後求供平衡，已無特殊變化，午刻在二一六萬左右掙扎，午後微降至二一六萬內，結果較前收微降七千，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根微緊，息價自一角二至一角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣一概平穩，美鈔三三九〇元買，三四一〇元賣，開後迄午刻始終在三三八〇元至三四〇〇元間徘徊，已形呆滯，午後仍無變動，結果較前收微升五元，港票平穩在七五〇元內外，稍起掙扎，結果較前收微降五元，港匯亦定，七五〇元至七六〇元，續有對做，印匯九一五元，英匯一二二五〇元有售，美匯則仍在牌價以上，指定銀行互有對做。</p>
<h3>平水區外銷綠茶中信局或可給價收買</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紹興平水綠茶，產飛頗豐，今年新貨，雖己上市，但在海外售價低康，國內成本高品下，交易迄未明朗化，茶商曾一再要求政府救濟，俾資減少損失，茲聞同業消息，不日將由中信局擬給予合理之價格　買，若平水珠茶每担約出廿七八萬元間，照此情形，茶農茶商俱得益匪淺。</p>
<p>行銷菲洲一帶之抽珍，蝦目，針眉，珍眉等綠茶，本市出口行家鑒於擱置多年之陳貨，售價尙稱相宜，同時海外需要不衰，故買氣大盛，連日印莊不斷買進之台灣細紅茶，因到存兩涸，賣戶扳抬愈力，刻下每担已猛晉達十二萬元，至於紅綠茶內銷，天津帮並不起勁，其他各地，去化依然絡繹不絕。</p>
<h3>白煤漲無止境</h3>
<p>陽泉煤因產區至石家莊及天津，交通阻梗，而津地存煤又稀，故滬地到貨已受影響，持有現貨者，均視作珍品，非俟相當行情，均不願輕易脫售，是以近來市價步步高升，經濟部燃管會雖已向安南訂購大量鴻基白煤塊，然到貨約需一月後可抵滬，届時市價當必趨回跌。</p>
<h3>進口貨新限制海關並無所聞</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本月二十二日合衆社紐約專電略稱：美國商界人士，今日接獲中國稅關通知，謂對四類進口貨之限制，將更形嚴格等語，太報以事太離奇，未予刋載，記者昨以此訊分詢關務署某負責人，及海關總稅務司李度。據稱：對此事並無所聞。李氏並稱：最近海關對各項進口貨之規定，並未有何變更。據吿：合衆社二十三日又有電自紐約拍來，聲明該訊係由紐約之「中國新聞社」（屬中國宣傳部）所發出。並謂該項消息，係來自南京方面云。</p>
<h3>游資多於籌碼華股飛升不已</h3>
<p>華股買風頓盛，美亞鰲頭獨佔，有進無退，各小股緊隨不已，冷門各股中之具有殷實資產者，奮發有爲，續有爭購，且因籌碼有限，粥少僧多，供不應求，飛升不已，晨初各股低價永紗六六五元，美亞三九三〇元，景福二四三元，新光二五五元，動興一七〇元，俟後即一再盤好，在美亞領導之下，晋進不已，迨午高價永紗七〇〇元，美亞四二八〇元，景福二六三元，新光二七八元，勤興二〇〇元，臨收稍盤，結果較前收計永紗微升十五元，美亞升半成，景福，新光，勤興各漲一成弱至一成半不等，較冷各股各好一成左右，元老股亦猛漲一成至二成不等。</p>
<p>外股證券帮觀望，於是大股情况平穩，小股續在西商集團收買中，進展甚速，怡紗自九千三退落至九千元內，英聯則自九千四升至九千八，各小股自開市扶搖直上，都呈高價，結果較前收計怡紗平平，英聯雖升而有限，會德豐，業廣，紙業，鋼業，怡啤各升半成內外，亞洲再升一成弱。</p>
<h3>蘇省府議決秋繭一担抵米三石</h3>
<p>蘇省府爲恐秋繭價格看低，影響秋繭收成，特於五十一次例會時議決，規定秋繭之標準價格，爲每市担不得低於三市石米價，以免蠶農損失，減低育蠶興趣，此項標準價格之規定，係依據烘折二百八十斤，繅折四百四十斤，剔除雙宮薄皮及其他車剔等之鮮繭計算。</p>
<h3>椰子油大批到埠</h3>
<p>小呂宋遝來椰子油五千餘桶，業已抵埠，聞接踵而來者，數量甚大，查椰子油，本年三月間，每担價曾達卅餘萬元，旋以大量到貨抵滬，價瀉十四萬元，此次外匯調整以後，漲起四萬元，現因大批椰子油到滬，價格勢將再度下瀉。</p>
<h3>大批台糖來滬</h3>
<p>美國棉麥亦有兩船到埠</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來輪船公司俟愛杜荷號由美喀倫皮抆埠（譯　）裝來麥子八千噸，現泊三菱碼頭起卸，又倫排脫羅根皮克號，由美傑爾夫灣（　音）　來棉花六千噸，約一萬三千餘件，停靠公和祥　頭起卸，又台，汕糖昨有到滬，招商局海宿輪及一〇四號登陸艇，昨由基隆汕頭來滬，運來台糖一千一百噸，汕頭土糖五百餘噸，另有瓷器六百噸。</p>
<h3>米價提高殺次黃豆大漲小回</h3>
<p>昨日南市塲客貨登記四四三〇石，又一千包，北市塲到二一三九石，社會局拋售三千餘包，約合三千七百餘石，南北兩市塲總達一萬餘石，粳米秈米均無軒輊，新粳則高俏次呆，新秈亦提高殺次，下等貨見疲，惟白元存到兩枯，零化尙殷，見升一二千元，麵粉供求兩平，市勢穩定，惟雜牌高粉，微見挺秀，小麥汕　動而不旺，甬帮尙可市勢暗中帶緊，北方進胃見懈，白麥做開甚少，麩皮鄕消轉動，價格見升百元，黄豆來貨雖稀，猛漲之後，店胃轉懈，回小千餘元，形成大漲小圓之狀，生仁仍帶挺秀，黄蔴回升一二千元，油市平疲，豆餅外埠消胃已停，鄕消不動，驟跌八百元。</p>
<h3>商會在高橋設分事務所</h3>
<p>（本報訊）浦東商業，向以高橋。洋涇及東昌等鎭爲最盛，近年高橋以進出口貨過路之多，愈見　榮，當地商店監於業務上聯絡之必要，發起籌組商會。經推舉代表，向本市市商會洽談。商會方面亦經派主管職員，前往實地視察。據最近消息，商會將准其籌組分事務所。惟浦東地區遼闊，市鎭衆多，此事務所將管轄若干市鎭，尙待磋商。聞東昌等鎭，與市商會直接交通尙便，大約將仍由商會直轄，不致隸屬於分事務所。該地商界領袖潘覺身等，本亦擬組織分事務，但因商會方面不願多設分支機關，且一浦對岸之隔，聯絡並無不便，故已放棄此議。據接近商會者透露消息，東昌在淪陷時期，會有此組織。而目前情勢改變，已無此必要。至於高橋等鎭將行籌組之分事務所，亦僅爲補救當前交通不便之較繁盛市鎭而設之過渡辦法。俟交通方便，將另行考慮其存廢問題云。市商會主管方面且曾表示，分事務所係理事會管轄下辦事　構之一，一切事務，仍須禀承理事會。經費亦由會撥付。各該地之商店應直接加入本市各該同業公會，然後方可經過公會，與商會取得聯系。浦東各市鎭商店之未加入公會者尙有不少，亟應加以勸導云。</p>
<h3>美國修正出口物價防止國外美貨濫漲</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕美國物價調整處頃宣佈改正美國出口貨定價之章程，目的在於便利出口商人之定價，但對於政府出口貨之定價策則並無變更，修正出口貨定價之宗旨爲使友善國家內之消費者，獲得在美國物價統制下，與國內消費者所得之同樣利益，並防止國外市場上美貨售價之上漲，出口商售與外國之貨物，將依照國內之限價，略加合理之利潤手續費及保險費之成本。</p>
<p>又電，勞工統計局頃宣佈，美國糧食售價自六月卅日以來，已漲上百分之三一·三，自對日勝利日以來，已增高至百分之四十以上，截至八月十七日爲止之一星期內，糧食售價漲起百分之三·四，穀類產物售價漲上百分之四·二，肉類·乳油·牛酪·奶粉與模造牛酪之售價均繼續上漲</p>
<h3>英報論新滙率最好含有彈性　一再貶值徒使黑市猖獗</h3>
<p>路透社倫敦二十三日電，英國經濟刊物之權威「經濟學者」論中國法幣最近之貶値事，稱，彈性外匯政策，即根據市塲實况，逐日規定外匯率，乃目前環境下唯一可行之原則，中國政府，荀不採納此一原則，則最近之困難，必致重演，在基本通貨膨脹之壓力，能予以制止，而物價已不復繼續上漲以前，使貨幣經過一個時期，再度貶値，足使外匯交易停頓，或使黑市匯率脫離官定匯率而上漲，且中國政府最近之舉，是否能糾正貿易之不平衡現象，亦屬懷疑，爲保全面子計，貶值百分之四十與貶値百分之五十，相差原屬無幾，今中國或當發現不但未曾保全面子，反將鼻子切去，星期一宣布之新匯率，並不令人感覺驚異，所奇者，乃中國當局何以待之如此之久始行宣布，當三月間宣布二〇二〇易美匯一元之辦法時，原以爲國內遝輸制之改良，及國外貨物之輸入，可减少各港，尤其是上海港之短少現象，新稅收及關稅得以阻止通貨膨脹之漏　，而國內之休戰，亦有助於信用之恢復，不料此等期望均未實現，而二〇二〇之新匯率，迅又不合實際，該一匯率一度曾高過公開市價，然此應部份歸功於中央銀行外匯管理法技術上之改良，通貨膨脹之壓力，旣增加不已，公開市價，旋即猛竄，而管制辦法，適足使强制規定之官方匯率，有損無益，走私之風大盛，當局乃不得不使法幣貶値約百分之四十矣。</p>
<h3>減低欠息問題手續費決取消　方案在候中央銀行核準中實行之期約在本月底左右</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：銀錢業往來客戶之欠息利率問題曾經銀行公會召開小組會硏究一過，擬定取消手續費及統收一角三分半之方案，現正候中央銀行核准中。施行之期，約在本月杪左右。據錢業界人士談：銀錢業欠息，本無附加手續費之制度。本年二月份起，方經決定照欠息利率附加手續費百分之一百。初實行時，各行莊常視本身營業情形，而分加百分之五十或一百，並非一律。迨五月份起，始一律附加百分之一百。本年六七月份久息利率爲八分，故附加手續費百分之一百後，即爲一角六分。茲爲取消手續費制度，及計算便利起見，遂擬統收一角三分半云。</p>
<h3>日本人造絲將大量來滬</h3>
<p>頃悉：日本有光人造絲一百二十萬磅，最近即可進口，此事我政府正與麥帥總部商談中，仍由中信局以易貨方式辦理，國內人造絲日來急遽上漲之市價，將遭受嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>青瓦下瀉</p>
<p>昨日磚灰市况略疲，惟靑瓦片以實銷减少，每萬由四十萬元外瀉至卅六七萬元，又水泥一度市塲擾亂後，現已回至每袋八千五百元。</p>
<p>五金漲二三成</p>
<p>五金之中除少數尙在向榮外，大致已漸趨穩定，約好起二三成不等，狗牌門鎖，以廠方忍痛供應，仍售原價，銼刀到貨甚多，不易見好，綠絲布以時令已過，雖有喊價而少成交。</p>
<h3>王部長盼商民合作　生絲決收買茶葉辦法未定貸款不緊縮敵廠分別標賣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部王部長昨答覆記者問題甚多，除棉紗問題，已另見專條外，其他各節，均關重要，茲條記其談話如下。</p>
<p>（一）進口稅率之修改，刻正在考慮中。</p>
<p>（二）生絲現決由中央化託局收買，收買辦法，亦已決定。至茶葉是否擬採收買政策，抑津貼出口辦法，則尙未決定。</p>
<p>（三）經部爲輔助督導各地民營工商業，施予技術及辦法上之種種協助起見，曾向行政院動議，在全國各工商中心地，分設工商督導團，現該團以組織辦法尙未草擬就緒，故尙未成立。</p>
<p>（四）工商貸款，如性質正當，而需要迫急，仍考慮貸放，並未因調整匯率後，而特別加强緊縮。</p>
<p>（五）標售敵僞工廠情形，除優待後方工廠廿二家，現正在看廠及商訂契約外，其業經標售兩次，而尙未脫售之各敵偽工廠一批，業已通知中國工業協會，及遷川桂工廠聯合會等，請轉知所屬會員工廠，於八月十五日起，至八月底止，分別前往看廠，九月一日至五日，爲各廠申請購買之期，該兩項規定期限，如實際情形需要，將分別展期五日。</p>
<p>（六）經濟部蘇浙皖特派員辦公處，決於九月底結束，未了事宜，刻正加緊料理中。</p>
<p>（七）此次政府調整匯率，係出口業及工商界一致之要求。經政府考慮，認爲此一措施，係屬必要，遂毅然實施調整，惟國家法令之能行，亦賴人民協助，昔年本人旅行英國時，深覺彼邦物價管理之所以成功，端在人民對法令上一字一言，均能切守遵守奉行，此次政府調整匯率後，外貨因成本增加，勢將增價，惟國內土貨，絕無漲價理由，否則，政府必予取締，現國營各項事業之生產品，決儘力維持原價不漲，深望人民對政府此番遵重民意而施行之決策，予以全力協助。</p>

<h3>諸葛武候後裔所在地中緬未定界：卡瓦山　本報十二日</h3>
<p>— 員張生力</p>
<p>滇西滄源夷卡兩族人民，近派代表　　等來昆，除向滇省當局呈述邊情外，並以「恩惠邊疆」錦旗一面，呈獻主席盧漢。記者走訪該代表之嚮導羅耀彩，承談卡區情况甚詳。</p>
<p>卡瓦山（簡稱卡區）居怒江之東，滄江之西，西接緬甸，南通還羅。其地迄今仍爲中緬未定界。民族以卡瓦擺夷兩族爲主。常中緬勘界時，滄源猛角董土司罕華相，（現已去世）曾語英人曰：「我歷代爲祖國看守邊疆，受祖國恩惠，我夷卡兩族雖爲落後邊民，亦係東亞黄種民族，鼻子眼睛均與貴國不同，豈能受異族管轄，而爲我祖國罪人。」這一段外交辭令，足證邊胞內向之心跡。</p>
<p>據談目前的卡區，存在兩個嚴重問題：一爲卡瓦人的遷徙，一爲老亢人（野人）的侵犯，少數在內地不能立足之漢人，常入卡區生活，彼等常施欺騙或敲詐手段，使邊胞不堪其苦，紛紛向國外遷移，一過怒江，英人予以數十文盧幣，一·二條耕牛，即可安居樂業。每年因此而遷徙者約達數百戶，長此以往，邊區人口勢必日益减少。此乃嚴重問題之一。與卡區爲鄰之老亢人，（屬緬甸）槍械優越，戰術新頴，常以游擊戰術侵擾邊胞，意圖佔領卡區重要據點。國軍雖有一部份駐防　洪及猛　兩地，然因某種關係，頗感棘手，致使邊胞常感不安。此一嚴重問題，更不能予以忽視。</p>
<p>卡區地勢，以「孔明山」爲最險阻，大有一夫當關，萬夫莫敵之勢。該山拔海約在五千呎以上，登山頂而四顧，則卡區十七王地瞭如指掌。數年前，英人曾將此山改爲「公民山」，而該區民衆，今仍沿用舊名。卡瓦人常曰：「吾卡族爲諸葛武侯之子孫，諸葛武侯乃中國有功之臣，卡瓦當然爲中國百姓。」相傳孔明南征時，曾在卡區宿營數天，留下大鐵砲一門，歷久沉入土中。民間傳稱：卡區如遇事變或鬥爭時，　比砲必先有嚮聲，而嚮聲之　　　久　，即可占知刀兵之大小。此事雖屬迷信，亦足證邊胞對於孔明之信仰。</p>
<p>卡區氣候，微較炎熱，若無驟劇變化，則覺四季難分。夏季溫度，平均在攝氏八十度左右，最高點亦不過九十餘度。冬季則在三十度以上。植物多栗樹菓樹，少松柏。農產以米爲大宗，不栽種雜糧。礦藏頗豐，均未開發。</p>
<p>卡區政治，現仍各自爲王。較著者有班陽王，馬德王，莫列王，英恩王，永和王，班洪王，箭籠王，班抗王，班老王，塔田王，紹慶王，一冷王，烏蘇王，甘三王，蠻迴王，一德王，觀仲王。此外尙有小王山官等名目。其中以班陽王爲十七王之冠，轄區戶口約六萬餘戶，槍枝財產亦最多。次爲莫列王，英恩王，馬德王，勢力亦甚雄厚。各王子均係世襲，採取「選長（長子）不選能」制。過去互相爭奪，弱肉强食，形成各覇一方的局面，保持原始的部落生活，谷王府之下，有大小供頭，等於漢人的保甲長，均係無給　。王子的兵力，分散於民間，實即「寓兵於邊」。全卡區人口約一百五十餘萬，平均五人有槍一支。而古代之弓劍，尙爲其常用的武器。王子均不作工，其任務爲管理轄區內人民，民間發生民刑案件，全用習慣法處置。沒有監獄。只有體罰及罰款。王子生活簡單，衣服與百姓無大差異。他們的最高享受，即是比較百姓多殺幾頭牛·在十七個王子中，只有班洪王住瓦屋，其他均住草房。喫飯雖已用碗，仍然不用筷子，用筷子的也只有班洪王·考其原因，係因班洪王之后爲一昆明女人，一切生活習慣，多已漢化。</p>
<p>整個卡瓦山區，卡瓦人佔十之八九，其中有「野」「純」之分。純卡瓦略與漢人相似。野卡瓦則有中古民族遺風，彼等好鬥，且有取人頭之習尙，每年二月及八月，卜「鷄卦」占知何方大利，即大批出發，取人首級，以祭秧榖。新地方與永和王之間，有一人頭寨，寨外樹有木　，取得首級後，即掛於牆壁木　上，此項成績最優者，以帶紅包頭　　品·野卡瓦中尙有人頭償，如明年祭秧榖，須用人頭十個，凡顧承辦者，可先領淸代價，到期若不能如數交付，即以該承辦人家屬之首級作抵。</p>
<p>卡瓦人不洗臉，均用手指進食，漢人敎用筷子，卡瓦答曰：「天生五指抓食，已覺便利。漢人用筷子，若在吃飯時閙架，可以筷子戳眼，豈不是太野蠻嗎」？卡瓦喜食臭物，擺夷喜食酸品，故有「酸擺夷臭卡瓦」之稱。</p>
<p>卡瓦人婚姻自由，男女相愛即可結合，結婚儀式簡單，戚族贈以茶糠，主人款以酒食。男子未婚前，可與任何少女談笑。已婚後，嚴受限制，若與其他女人發生關係，則予以罰款處分。未婚男子喜彈三絃琴，如獲少女愛慕，即可同居，父母均引以爲榮。</p>
<p>擺夷人能耐署熱，居於平原，秉性和睦，多諳漢語，男子體格健康，衣着食宿，與漢人大同小異。女子秀媚，優於其地之漢人。下繫圍裾，上着短衣，十九不穿鞋襪。嗜淸潔，勤洗浴。好染黑齒以爲裝飾。喜戴銀質耳環，手鐲，項圈，小鈴等物，語言淸脆動聽，爲他族所不及。卡區語言有擺夷話及卡瓦話，而以前者較爲普通易學。近年來漢夷通商通婚，漢語日漸通行，內地文化得以稍稍輸人。</p>
<p>卡　藝　　　後，識　字者未　百分之一。擺夷人信奉緬寺，緬寺即其敎育機關·內有長老一人，佛爺數人，小和尙多人。擺夷男子，幼時即送入寺中讀擺夷文，（擺夷經書）擺夷族每個寨子，均設有緬寺。純卡佤族中，亦有此寺之設置，為數較少。卡瓦人信　教會與巫　，有病不求醫，咒而不愈，則　其死亡。卡區敎會勢力甚大，抗戰期間傳敎士更加緊工作，且創有卡音文字，致使今日之卡區，多能用此文字以通信。</p>
<p>卡區無正式商店，每五天趕街一次。除各種日用品外，尙可購得化裝品，食品價極貴，用品價甚低。漢人前往經商者，其目的在換取烟士，故將其所帶去之貨物廉價出售，自然平抑了物價。卡區交易不用鈔票，仍用銀圓，而在班山，蠻盾，南坎武，大小中弄一帶，除用銀圓外，並通行盧幣。抗戰以前，卡區商人常往臘戍經商，甚至有直到瓦城者，但自緬甸淪陷後，卡區與緬甸之商業關係即吿停頓，</p>
<p>卡夷兩族人民代表南天福，此次由滄源來昆，途中共歷時十九日，開其主要任務，爲陳述邊胞意志及近况，希望內地同胞多予指導協助，使邊區得以早日開發。並盼地方當局，眞正做到「恩患邊疆」四字。</p>

<h3>蕭紹行腳</h3>
<p>— 十八日紹興訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>在天目山五里亭聽泉聲，浙省生席沈成章氏對記者說：「我們下次要到寗紹一帶去，你可以同去吧？」</p>
<p>八月十六日早上七點鐘，沈成章氏，余鍾驥·李毅之·張子純·田德萬兄等與記者同作寗紹之行。先乘火車到蕭山縣屬的長興鄕，那　地方上很多人在迎候，接着便到西江塘，一位七十一歲的老人說明西江塘之如何重要，甚至說西江塘決堤，蕭紹一帶即將成爲澤國，而聞家跟任何堅固的工程，亦屬用用，更强調說這是紹興蕭山的後門。這是保衛蕭紹的水上長城。</p>
<p>稻麥收成尚佳棉花恐受雨水影響</p>
<p>他又領我們到距塘三里許的盤頭盤箭處巡視，該處盤頭盤箭，大多已成土地，即西江塘亦屬泥塘，想見不及海寗海鹽段的嚴重，不過年久失修，當係事實罷了。這位老人又率同鄕長向沈先生遞狀請求將航空當局圈定的飛機塲免予開闢，並且跪下表示哀懇之意。沈先生同我們到圈定的飛機塲去勘察，將至圈定地點，即有甚多鄕婦，持香跪求，甚至攔住去路，鄕長連喝：「有要求派代表來，這樣的要求，我也負不起這個責任。」沈先生仁　爲懷，總算在臨去蕭山前答應了他們轉向航空當局交涉的要求。</p>
<p>我們換乘大卡車赴蕭山，不上一小時即到達縣城，此地已爲古越國境界，著名的范蠡大夫即生在縣屬的西興鄕。縣城雖亦曾遭敵偽破壞，但較餘杭·臨安·於潛，却好得多了。縣府即借設在縣內從前開典當的有楠木廳的家裏。這也可以想見蕭山縣戰前的富有，更可以瞭見破壞的程度不十分嚴重。蕭山以農產爲大宗，棉花，烟葉，尤爲農產中的特產。今年稻麥還好，棉花因雨水太多，恐有影響，烟葉亦不如以前，產量恐不及戰前棉花的五百萬担，烟葉約三百萬担，我尋問當地人土，都說現在最重要的問題莫如坍江，據說已坍五十二萬畝，今年二月到八月，就坍了八萬數千畝，已有七萬人光景，急待救濟。他們希望政府趕緊來築塘禦水，殊不知江流改道，是絕對沒有辦法的，除非河床整個穩定之後。縣中人士，鑒於政府現在在注意築塘禦水，所以亦都來一個請求。當然，坍江純爲極嚴重的問題，但穩定河床非一朝一夕之功，則僅築塘禦水已失掉永久作用的價値了。</p>
<p>物價低於杭垣縣政工作仍須努力</p>
<p>蕭山的物價已較杭州爲低，人民似亦較於澛，昌化生活過得稍好。縣境有公路鐵路，交通尙稱便利。惟談到復員，實在還沒有達到飽和點，因爲人民的生活終究比戰前差得多。人口亦比戰前少了。所以縣玫工作者不但不應該滿足，而且要加緊的努力。再老實說一句，蕭山現階段的縣政工作，還不够理想，因爲即就著名的湘湖來講，這是一個較易開發的區域，可以利用坍江的災民來養魚，墾植，闢爲風景區，現在的情景，已遠非前人詩中所云：「北幹山前春欲暮，阿子前湖採　去，藕根　葉生滿湖，艇子灣灣不知處」。而是滿眼荒凉，到處蔓草萋萋。這就是縣級工作者的工作，不够理想的一點。但也或許是時間的關係吧。</p>
<p>在蕭山午飯後，驅車到紹興，紹興是越王勾踐的故都，而且是治水的大禹功成駕崩卜葬之地，又是晋王羲之著蘭亭集而卜葬之處，是革命先烈徐錫麟，秋瑾的家鄕，是當代名人蔡元培，邵力子，魯迅，周恩來，葉琢堂的故里。</p>
<p>紹興破壞較少人口僅八十四萬人</p>
<p>這裏破壞更少，市面亦完整如故，不過人口戰前爲一百二十萬人，而現在僅八十四萬人了。土地面積爲二百四十萬畝，可耕種者二百萬畝，中心學校九十七所，國民學校五百〇七所，私立小學三所，失學兒童四萬〇七百〇三人，失學成人十六萬五千五百九十三人，失學婦女八萬五千〇四人，這裏特產爲馳名的紹興老酒，錫箔與淡水魚，絲綢等。戰前釀酒，每年要在十萬缸以上，而現在則銳減至十分之二，僅有二萬餘缸。釀酒的原料，主要是糯米，和麯，倒不是本地出產，是以丹陽，金壇，溧陽，嘉興等地的糯米作原料的，紹興老酒，除著名的狀元紅，加飯，竹葉靑，善釀，花雕外，更有一種名爲「女兒酒」，其味至醉。據說是大戶人家在產女後，即加工製造一缸或數紅，釀好後，封固縝密，即埋藏於家裏行走必經的路的泥土下，令人踐踏，等女兒長大後，將此酒取出饗客，其朱甚醇，以博取飲者之贊美爲榮。</p>
<p>箔工改業問題落在行政人員身上</p>
<p>錫箔爲祭祀或燒香之用，以塊錫打成極薄的簿片，敷以薄紙，即出售於市。江南江北人民，每購之摺成錢錠，燒去以表祭祀之意。這錫箔雖然帶着迷信的色彩，但　此爲生的將達二十餘萬人。這錫的原料爲來自香港，雲南，天津，江西，屯溪，寗波等地。錫箔出口，每月至少四萬塊，最多八萬塊。稅收方面，縣以百分之十五爲稅率，每月最少可收六千萬，最多可收一萬八千萬，可見其收入之豐。現在中央已收回統稅，走稅則爲百分之六十。許多箔業工人，都知道時代一天天的文明，這行當終究不是常事。所以亦要求改業，這改業的責任却落在行政人員的身上。淡水魚相傳范蠡即在南池養角致富，三聚三散，人稱陶朱公。這種魚蕩面積，在紹興約有十餘萬畝，漁民約有五六千人，民國十年左右，產魚在二百萬斤以上。抗戰時紹興陷於敵手，抗戰後復員爲難，計損失魚具一千八百餘件，物資喪失十之八九，漁村全部破產，今後應該積極加以扶植，同時在養魚的方法上加以積極的改良。關於絲綢，記者已在『烽烟處處，杭綢北銷無望』一文中述及過了，大致與記者所述仍無大差別。</p>
<p>發揚勾踐精神爭取生聚教訓良機</p>
<p>我們曾至紹興失陷時文廟正演戲的地方去看過，這裏有敵人在時的水牢與狗刑塲，深覺敵人的殘暴。</p>
<p>又到曹娥·錢塘·錢淸三江交流處的三江閘去參觀，據說這三江閘爲明時湯紹恩所築，地方農田水利獲益不少，故地方上有湯公祠的建築，現在坍圯的部份已經政府修理好，三江閘一公里半處的斜坡塘，亦經在整修。</p>
<p>在紹興，曾去秋瑾烈士的「秋風秋雨愁煞人」的風雨亭，可以俯覧東海的望海亭，謁過禹陵，訪過蘭亭，都覺有加以培修的必要。而歷史上著名的越王毫，已被日本人拆毀無存，是的，越王勾踐的精神，確能使日本人見而畏恨。我們只要保持這種精神，一定會富强起來。但是國內的烽烟，怎有時間來生聚敎訓？我們覺得有重造越王毫的必要，雖然這不是急要之務，但對於教育的意義與價値上不能不說是重大的。</p>

<h3>檢討戰前長期存款問題</h3>
<p>— 恕盧</p>
<p>吾國勝利後，經濟復興，未上正規，致幣値日益抵落，以物價相較，有爲戰前五千倍者，有爲戰前一萬倍者。因之。戰前之長期存款及人壽保費等之付還問題，遂發生無窮之波折。最近有因二千元儲蓄存款，要求以三千借給付本息之訴訟，結果經法院判決以一千倍付給之事實（見最近各報），傳聞漢口金融業，曾於去冬有同樣之訟案以五千倍付給戰前存款者。蓋長期存款者，大都備作生活之費，一且幣値低落至幾千倍，殆皆無以爲生，故爲生存計，不得不盡力掙扎，掙扎而不得則訴之法律，似亦人情之常。且政府於三十四年十二月十八日有民事訴訟補充條例之頒佈，其第十二條關於戰前法律行爲有如下之條文：「法律行爲成立後，因不可歸責於常事人之事由，致情事變更，非當時所得預料，而依其原有效果顯失公平者，法院應公平裁量，爲增减給付或變更其他原有效果之判決。」故在法律上言，以不失公平爲原則，而得變更原有之效果。今就事理論之，究竟戰前長期存款及人壽保費，應否根據數額付還，抑照幣値倍數付給？如照幣値倍數付給，第一·銀行是否有此力量？第二，存戶是否應享此項權利？第三國家經濟之復興是否受到影響？凡此種種，皆値得作進一步之檢討者也。</p>
<p>第一，銀行是否能擔負以幣値倍數付還戰前長期存款？査吾國銀行，在戰前除國營各銀行外，其他商業銀行之資本，多者四五百萬元，（內中亦有七百五十萬元者）·少者不過二十五萬元；而各項長期存欲，大者五六千萬元至八九千萬元，小者亦一二千萬元，约爲銀行本身資本之十倍以上，換言之，即銀行資本爲長期存款百分之十耳。故存户之利害實較銀行股東爲重且大。至於各銀行之營業總額，有高至一萬萬四五千萬元至二萬萬餘元者，幾占資本之二三十倍；此二三十倍之資金，全賴存户集合之游資而委托銀行經營者也。再査銀行及人壽保險公司等經營資金之途徑，因係畏期之故，大都投資於房地產，或外幣計算之證劵，甚或自營工廠。即以房地產一項論，在戰前僅値法幣二三萬元者，現在市價约售黄金五六百兩；以二十萬計，合法幣一萬萬元以上，即等於戰前约在五千倍左右。此外所有外幣蹬券及自營工廠之現値，亦較戰前增加數千倍甚至有萬倍以上者。如照法院判決以一千倍付還戰前長期存款，在銀行與人壽保險公司，不過變賣其財產之一小部份，已足應付，而於銀行及人壽保險公司之根基，不致發生動搖也。</p>
<p>第二，存户是否應享有以幣値倍數取還長期有款之權利？</p>
<p>蓋銀行之首要任務，爲調盈濟虛。其吸收存款，集合游資，聚零爲整，資助農工商業，以營利爲目的。故一面調存戶游資之盈，一面濟農工商資金之虛，對於存戶，實具有委托經營享受分紅之原則，以經營所得，一部份作爲經營者之酬勞，一部份作爲委托者之紅利，此種分配，大都平衡，斷無過重過輕之弊。蓋在抗戰之前，吾國金融穩定，營利事業，獲利甚微，穩妥投資，其收獲大旨不過四五分。故其時長期存款之利率，憑時期之久暫，有高至一分七八釐至二分者，約佔贏利之四成；而銀行即經營者，約佔贏利之六成，且須擔負一切開支。此種利益之分配，甚得其平·故存戶樂於接受，決無怨言·又存戶之作長期存款者，大都有一定之用途：有依賴利息作經常生活之費者；有備作養老喪葬之用者；有儲作兒女敎育之需者。一旦幣値慘落，昔日百元可維持兒女一年敎育費者，今則只値得購買拍紙薄一本，故此項預定之用途，根本無法維持。然此在表面上，似不能歸咎於銀行及人壽保險公司，但事實上則不然。蓋銀行或人壽保險公司之現有財產，較戰前超越萬倍以上，此項財產之原有資金百分之九十，係屬長期存戶之存款、而同時因財產增値之故，一如其他商業公司，紛紛增資送股矣。今占營運資金百分之十之股東，旣得享受增資送股（換言之即分紅）之權利，而占有營運資金百分之九十之畏期存戶，在理亦應享受同樣分紅之權利。况存戶以存款交存銀行作爲長期存款，實已含有委托經營之原則；其分享紅利，自屬廳得之權利。故銀行與人壽保險公司，斷不應以戰前幣額付給此項長期存款，而應以戰前幣値倍數付給之；否則受委托經營者、幾有獨覇紅利之嫌矣。</p>
<p>第三，國家經濟之復興是否受到影響？査民國廿五年經政府確定法幣政策後，又値農產　收，工商活躍，銀行存款，驟形擁擠。其時美金只値法幣三元有奇，實係我國經濟全　時代。當時因銀行資金充裕，對於農工商業，盡量援助，放出款項之在數十萬元至百餘萬元者，毫不爲難；至於二三萬元之放款，更屬平凡無奇。因銀行之盡量援助，遂使農工商業益臻　榮，以造成戰前之經濟全盛狀態，而抗戰時間民族資金之雄厚表現，亦莫不歸根於此時期，歸根於銀行有充裕之資金以援助農工商業而造成此雄厚之民族資金。但査銀行之所以有此充裕資金者，莫不依賴零星存戶以長期存款協助之。故蓮用民族資金者乃金融業也，集合民族資金者乃零星之長期存戶也。民族資金之雄厚興否，全視集合者之努力與否。當普法戰爭後、法國能迅速賠欽，使法國能迅速復興，莫不歸功於法國人民儲蓄之努力。今吾國雖吿勝利，而經濟復興，尙遙無遙期；民族資金，益形薄弱；銀行之長期存款，在數的方面或有增加，而質的方面，勢必大減。在戰前放出二三萬元現在爲二三萬萬元）認爲平凡者，今則須多方考慮，不便辦理矣。至於戰前放出數十萬元至百萬元（現爲數十萬萬元至一百萬萬元（認爲可放者，今則大都無此力量單獨辦理矣。雖由於大部份資金尙未解凍，實則新來之長期存款，絕少輸入，欲求如戰前之盡量援助農工商業，勢不可能。蓋長期存戶，因長期存款之一若設阱陷人，畏懼之心，油然而生，遂致裹足不前，不復信仰銀行委託經營，而自營其投機或囤積矣。然投機囤積爲絕對不能生產之投資，故於整個民族資金，益見其少，不見其增。須知金融業有協助國家復興經濟之責任，民族資金之散失，於經濟復興，爲莫大障礙。故爲金融業計，正應如何鼓勵儲蓄，引彙游資，一方面謀本身資金之充裕，一方面助國家經濟之復興，則戰前長期存款，應以幣値倍數付還，不特爲鼓勵儲蓄吸引游資之道，於吾國經濟復興之機能，有莫大裨益。</p>
<p>綜上檢討，法院旣有明文，而事實又合乎情聖，所關於各個存戶之利害者小，而於整個民族資金之散失，以致障礙國家經濟之復興，所關者大。吾國金融業不乏賢明者，諒有同見。拋磚引玉，相期爲合理之檢討。</p>
<p>（作者附註）：本文只限於長期存款，並未談及公債。惟近以法院判案，致引起公債之漲風。但吾人須知公債與長期存款，性質完全不同。蓋公債之發行，由於國家需財孔亟，如藉徵收賦稅未免遲緩，故不得不借債濟急，猶如救急之針藥，一面徵集，一面立即消費，非如長期存款，則由銀行經營以盈利爲目的者也。况國家度支，莫不取之於民，如按幣値倍數還債，無異增加全民衆之担費。故公債之　　，如　幣値計算，於情於理，均有不合。　　吾人勿爲投機者所誤。</p>

<h3>武裝還鄉話如</h3>
<p>— 十日如訊　增熊·白明</p>
<p>幾個月的饑寒，幾個月的痛苦，是多麽難忍的歲月，在這些日子中，流浪人每日每夜都做着還鄕的夢！終於州這日子來臨了。實在的，這日子是用血花換取得來的！</p>
<p>七月三十一日的早晨，南通西公園一帶的公路上密排了五六十輛整齊的軍用卡車和二十餘輛小汽車，在晨光嘉微中，已經陸續地有許多難胞，到這兒來集合了。記者也是其中之一，看到很多熟識的面孔，互相交換了一個微笑，這不難想像到他們的內心是怎樣的愉快！</p>
<p>一隊隊的健兒，也陸續地來到這兒了。在長官們的指揮分配中，極迅速地走上卡車，他們的任務，是專送我們還鄕的。</p>
<p>九時，隊伍全部都集合在卡車上了，二百幾十名流亡難胞也各自走進了小汽車，前面是三十餘輛裝滿軍士的卡車先開始前進着，我們的車子便也跟着前進，再看看後面，馬達隆隆的巨聲也帶來了三十餘輛的健兒。</p>
<p>新近搶修工竣的通如公路，還沒有完全舖平，車子經過低窪處時，顚簸得非常利害。沿途護路警士，配着美式卡槍，戒備在公路兩側。由這邊的崗哨可能看到前後兩邊的黝黑的面孔，罩上了一只鋼盔，以緊張的神情，握住了卡槍，用嚴肅的態度，送走我們道個冗長的行列。甲蟲般的兩輛裝甲戰車，上面備有小型鋼砲，不時的前後逡巡着，每過一個據點，都可以看到大批增援部隊，在那兒整裝待發。爲了我們回家，勞苦了成千萬的軍中朋友，在軍中，我想到我們該怎樣的向他們致以最崇高的敬意！</p>
<p>九十餘輛大小汽車，經過了丁埝鎭之後，漸漸地加速度的前進着。盛夏的田野，依然是那麼樸實，玉蜀黍的高榦，深黄的稻穗，差錯雜在一片廣大的平原上。在車中，目睹那些成熟的農作物，知道這是一個豐歲，可是竟看不到一個田家在忙着收穫。這些爲戰爭而荒廢了的農作物，在目前的中國，我想還正多着。八年抗戰疲憊了的國家，在今夭復員聲中，還重演這些，慘况，不由我不對現實詛咒了！</p>
<p>離開丁埝鎭四五里路，這兒在十天之前，還是一個被作爲拉鋸戰的戰場，整塊的稻田被燒得焦黑，斷垣殘壁，隨處可見。公路兩側的那些戰死的遺屍，直到現在還沒有被人掩埋，在烈日的暴晒下，蒼蠅羣聚，蛆虫蠕動已不復能辨出他們的面孔和眼耳口鼻等種種器官了，紅白相間，元糊成一片。一陣陣的惡具，送到鼻中，直欲令人嘔吐，我們在車中，雖已備有萬金油塗過的手帕當着口罩，却也絲毫沒有效力。在難聞的屍臭中，車子經過和着血花的塵土，掀起了數丈的高度，我們又進行二十餘里，漸漸地看到了如城的幾座高的建築了。</p>
<p>共軍行動要點　組軍徵糧無所不為</p>
<p>當記者在這裏會見了交警第七總隊第三大隊長鍾祥禎氏的時侯，承他吿訴記者許多關於共軍在如皋一帶的胡亂行動，綜其要點，大抵如次：</p>
<p>（一）組織民兵，充當砲灰－每鄕組織民兵大隊，大隊下設三中隊，每中隊下設三個或四個分隊，（即每保一分隊），平時利用放哨及探取軍情、作戰時利用民兵組織衝鋒隊，任第一二綫之猛衝，以消耗我彈藥探索我陣地配備情形，爾後以野戰軍向我弱點猛撲，且民衆誰不參加民兵，誰家就被封門罰糧，（兩石大麥）此次丁埝之役，民兵被充砲灰的，有三百人之多。</p>
<p>（二）廣徵公糧，民不聊生—每年分夏征。秋征兩次，夏征的糧食是小麥，秋征的糧食是稻籽，每畝最高額有十四市斤外，每一斤糧食帶征半斤公草，統計每一個村（保）的在百石之譜。</p>
<p>（三）抄查逆產，徒飽私囊—凡在偽方曾任一天職務者，均在被懲之，列將所有家產完全充公抄收，說是分給老百姓，帮窮人翻身，其實鄕長村長都發了大財，老百姓還是吃虧。</p>
<p>（四）借刀殺人，苛行懲奸—抓了一個漢奸，便召開公審大會，明明要殺他，却假意通過民衆問要殺不要殺，羣衆本是做傀儡的，那裏敢喊不殺，因此他們便說這是羣衆的意見，並不是政府要殺的。還有次一等的，便是頸部掛一個木牌叫做漢奸牌，重約三四斤，牌上寫出賣祖國之漢奸某某字樣，將他們禁在家裏，叫做坐人民監牢，最多十年，並每天令其懸牌穿紅衣，戴高帽，服淸描街道厠所等苦役。若彼等出門時，不懸牌，穿紅衣，即令人隨時毒打。</p>
<p>（五）煽惑佃農，苛待業主—組織農聯會和翻身會，向業主算賬，將民國二十六年前業主超過二五减租的租額，倒出來，並將佃農租田時的押租金退出，逼使業主將所有田畝算光，名爲倒租倒息運動，如果業主否認，便用桐油石灰調數在業主臉部，捆起來，戴高帽子，沿莊毒打，或豎起高台，敎業主站在上面招手喊老中央挽救他等等。</p>
<p>（六）按人分田，計口授糧—每人分攤田畝耕種，將所獲糧食交給公家，然後再由公家按照人口授糧，這樣使人民無勤惰之分，致田畝荒蕪，生產减低。</p>
<p>（七）取締僧尼，禁止追　—逼使僧尼留髮還俗，娶妻嫁夫，凡有追醮祖宗之事，一列禁止。</p>
<p>（八）黑夜聽壁，白畫聞香—組織聽壁小組，夜間到人家靜聽有沒有反動言論。白畫組織聞香隊，嗅到人家有香氣，（例如肉魚）便到那家詢問吃肉魚的原因，除了請人帮閑以外，便遭受干涉。</p>
<p>（九）禁用媒妁，提倡私奔—男女到了成年，如有媒妁介紹結婚，便用猪肉掛在介紹人的頸上，說是好吃的人，才要做媒。他的意思是只要男女雙方同意，便可配成夫妻。</p>
<p>（十）發動兒童，對抗尊親—組織兒童團，除了帮助民兵站崗以外，專以對抗頑固家長，一個兒童受了家長責罰，便同全體兒童向他對抗。</p>
<p>（十一）僞稱民主，賞行獨裁—他們政府的組織，是三三制，就是國民黨佔三分之一，共產黨佔三分之一，無黨派佔三分之一，其實國民黨要遭受國特的罪狀裁判無黨無派人士，還不隨聲附和，所以各機關的主管人員，皆非共產黨員不可。</p>
<p>（十二）出賣祖國，供人驅使—根本上失去中華民族的立塲，認爲蘇聯的一切都是好的，例如唱歌唱的是蘇聯國歌，開會掛的是蘇聯國旗等。</p>
<p>共黨政治人員　憬然悔悟痛改前非</p>
<p>據最近的消息，共軍在蘇北負責人方面，頗多覺悟份子，認爲再這樣幹下去，對我國民族及人民，實所不利，因此憬然悔悟過來。例如共軍如皋警衛團第七連政治指導員婁緝，便是其中的一例。婁緝年二十四歲，世居在如皋縣丁埝區土劉鄕。據七月廿七日婁君自言書中云：日本鬼子侵陷蘇北便吿失學，（那時十六歲）二十二歲到如皋南鄕敎　，因爲那個地方，赤色思想很深，主要活動人員是胡雲秋（黨名林霖），他爲了一時被誘惑，在二十三歲的那年的秋季，加人共產黨，（黨名尤咸）後又參加如皋縣警衛團第七連担任特務長，今年升中尉指導員，專門歡喜黑夜進兵，打擊少數部隊，如果遇有大量部隊淸剿，那就如麻雀一般的飛去，（名叫麻雀戰術）軍隊分野戰軍和地方武力，本地屬華中軍區，司令是粟裕，政委是鄧子恢，一共有九個縱隊，佈散在隴海路和津浦路二綫。現在的重心工作，是分田運動，每人劃田一畝，廢除保甲，改立村組制，完全由人爲單位，不受家庭的束縛，俾使造成一個鬥爭的社會。最後，他說：『各黨各派，祇有在蔣主席領導之下，才能成爲一個富强的國家，所以，他現願誠心悔過，痛改前非，在政府良好敎育之下，重新做一個好靑年。』</p>

<h3>河北的農林水利</h3>
<p>— 本報十一日保定訊　特約記者楊炳森</p>
<p>河北省西北兩方山嶺綿密，地勢高峻，爲良好森林地區。東南兩方爲黄土平原，土壤肥沃，純以農產爲主，境內頗爲富饒，惟因年來慘遭戰禍，且多天災，農村經濟已經破產，値茲農業復員爲當前急務之際，農田水利之建設工作，尤乃先決條件，爰特將　省農業情况報道一下，以供參考。</p>
<p>（一）仁壽區之復修：仁壽渠係民國二十二年由冀省府會同華北水利委員會議決建築，引滹沱河水灌漑靈壽，正定，行唐，新樂，獲鹿等縣農田，總面積約三十八萬畝，並曾設滹沱河灌漑工程委員會，按照規定程序分別進行，至三十四年五月預定完成北部工程，可灌田十三萬七千畝，至七七戰事爆發，工作即行停頓，南部工作亦未着手，至現在全部則被破壞殆盡，不堪使用。此渠擬仍由冀省府會同華北水利委員會，繼續修建。或與行總合作，以工待賑辦法興築，是項工作完成後，預期之收益，可灌田三十八萬畝，預計每畝增產百市斤，每年可增產農作物三千八百萬市斤。</p>
<p>（二）滏陽河閘之修建及打充：民二十年省當局曾於滏陽河之邯鄲附近，修築閘門五道，節制永流溝渠二十一縣，計受益村莊達一百三十四村，灌溉農田達一千五百頃，現在大部已被破壞，冀省府亦應修復原有閘門，及渠道外，再增修新渠，預期收益灌田，可達二十萬畝，以每畝增產百市斤計，共增產二千萬斤。</p>
<p>（三）興殖渠修建與域地改良：該渠爲商民玉曾怡在民元組織之興殖水利公司，與省府合同修築利用永定河水，灌田四十頃，省府擬於最近復修該渠，恢復舊態。至關於域地改良過去曾利用河水去域放淤辦法以改良土質，使部份土質，改變爲良好農田，如天津小站稻田即以此種辦法改成者，在抗戰期間中日人亦曾於冀東沿海各地試辦，成效頗著，但勝利後沿海各地多爲共軍駐在區，原有之設備，大部被破壞。</p>
<p>水利機關設立</p>
<p>冀省各河，以永定，大淸，南北運，滹沱等河爲患最大，山洪稍發，或經大雨，即成汜濫，淹沒農田，百姓流離失所，本年數處河堤速被共軍扒決漫溢，適受人爲之水患，痛更難言，冀省復員後，即設立各河河務局，專司防範，搶修，築堤水及査騐水位諸事，此外各河局今後擬負責興修水利，使沿河兩岸非惟無水患之慮，且可灌兩岸之田，裨益良多。</p>
<p>鑿井十年計劃</p>
<p>冀省地勢平原較多，頗宜於耕種，惟土質疏鬆，且多細砂，易於滲透，並受大陸氣候之影響，春季雨量常感不足，至秋則雨量充沛時有旱澇不均之情形，以是當前之掘井工作，爲補足之必要者。以往冀省掘井悄形，在平漢綫之淸苑，定縣，新樂，行唐，　縣，寗晋，高邑，柏鄉，堯山，內邱，沙河永年等縣，津浦沿綫之南皮，寗津等縣，冀東方面之豐潤，三河等地普遍提倡掘井，成績尙佳，其中眼數數最多者首推定縣，共有一九九七九眼，次爲無極縣爲一一九八三眼，邪台六〇三七眼。定縣之灌漑地約佔全縣百分之三十，無極縣百分之七十，但所掘之井，全係舊式，小井深的五米至十米，爰提倡掘新井乃刻不容緩之急務，冀省孫主席亦將掘新井一事，列爲本年度之中心工作，並決定利用下列各法一，迴轉式掘井機法。二，網擱式，三，岩心試錐機，四，手動試錐機，分別採用，冀省府並擬定十年掘井計劃，按期推行，茲簡誌其計劃於次：</p>
<p>第一期示範期（三十五年）本期首先成立鑽機技術人員訓練機構，但不能立即應用，故不能進行大規模之工作計劃，祇能在適合地區提倡掘并，並先就交通便利地方安靜之縣境，如保定，唐山，大典各處，另在產棉各縣，擇定地區試掘，倘每井之直徑爲一一〇耗，每井平均流量每日三千噸至一千噸，則能灌田四頃至十頃，此期元成後，即可有二百餘頃田隨時灌漑，不再受早災之威脅。</p>
<p>第二期：推廣</p>
<p>第二期推廣期（三十六年）在本期內成立掘井隊，添購鑽機五百架，分設在十五個掘井中心區，開展工作，依照各縣耕田面積平均分配，全年計掘井三四二眼，亦另在產棉區掘井若干，藉資增加棉產。</p>
<p>第三期：普遍</p>
<p>第三期普遍期（三七年至三九年底）本期內第一年仍由掘井隊，添購鑽機五百架，連前共有一千架，仍分在十五區內繼續工作，全年可掘八十公尺之深井六千四二眼，第二年添購鑽機一千架，全年掘井一二〇四二眼，第三年再添購鑽機千架，計連前共有鑽機三千架，仍以同樣深度及速度工作，則全年可掘一八〇四二眼。</p>
<p>第四期：完成</p>
<p>第四期完成期（四十年至四四年底）以原有鑽機在全期五年內，可掘深八十公尺之井九〇二一〇眼，連同一二三各期共計十年，可能在省境內，完成深井一二九四二三眼，每井之每日流量爲二千噸，至民國四四年底，則可灌田六四七一一五頃，但冀省可耕之地爲八六六〇九八頃，是項十年計劃元成後，全省五分之四良田，不再遭受旱災，此外另在靠近各河沿岸築堤蓄水，並同時在水位較淺之地如太行山一帶，提倡由人民自動造土井，或掘泉，以補掘井之不足，故十年後全省旱災可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>至掘井十年經費在本年春季預算爲機件估價的四三四一八〇七〇美元。掘井工作隊成本一四四七四〇〇元（國幣）。掘井工作隊應向農民貸款數一八七三·二二·〇五〇·二〇〇元（國幣），掘井喞筒四一九三三〇五二〇〇〇元（國幣）。</p>
<p>推進造林運動</p>
<p>冀有天然林之分佈區，經數千年來之濫伐，以及開墾，放牧，焚燒等人爲之災，幾無原始林之存在，今日所存在者，僅零數之天然林殘片而已，頃據冀省建設廳調査所存在者有一，昌黎森林；面積十五萬畝，二，東陵森林，面積五十七萬五千畝，三，西陵森林，面積不詳·四，順德西部森林，面積七千公畝·小面積者有密雲，香河，宛平，房山等處森林。至人造林有一，西山造林，面積十七萬畝。二，琉璃河東方造林，三，秦皇島一帶之防風防砂之海岸林，四，北戴河，灤河附近造林，五，東西陵造林。綜計養林面積六三〇三〇七畝，防水林面積二五七九九二畝，防風林面積三八三五一三畝。衛生林八二四二〇畝。森林面積逐日減少，故於敵人投降後，冀省僅在收復之四十餘縣中，努力倡導造林運動，但收效甚微，各階層應一致保護林木，栽植新林，動員全體，一齊實行，始可發展，省當局亦應妥擬詳細計劃，以達到綠化河北之目的。</p>
<p>蝗災數字可驚</p>
<p>冀省連年頻遭蝗害，損失殊鉅，例如民國十八年全省一二四縣患蝗，當時損失的爲四五〇〇萬元，民二十八年二九縣蝗災，爲害面積的三九〇萬畝，當時損失爲七七〇萬元。二十九年七二縣蝗災，損失爲五〇〇萬元（以上冀省建設廳調査統計數字）。本年六月初，軍糧城及楊柳靑一帶發現蝗蝻，一帶麥田損失約減收百分之四十，筆者寫此稿時保定近郊亦發現蝗虫，兩日之間損失農田達五百畝，故冀省立即成立治蝗委員會，負責辦理一切治蝗事宜”至經費確定省經常費六六八，四〇〇元。事業費二，八二〇，〇〇〇元。縣治蝗經常費二五四，〇〇〇元，事業費一，三一〇，〇〇〇元，計全省有一三二縣（現僅四十二縣）年需二〇六，五〇八，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，冀省農業之建設，當局頗具決心，在優良自然條件下，而不能順利推行，乃全繫於人爲之治安關係，故對於上述各項計劃記者極盼政府人民聯合一體，努力爲本省，爲國家，切實實行，使大家共享富鐃之樂！</p>
<h3>王陽明的故里　姚江近情</h3>
<p>十八日餘訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>十八日淸晨，我們一行向餘姚方面進發，滿野油綠的田疇，遠遠的山嶺起伏，叫人胸襟舒暢。經過了幾個小小的山　，有人說這是從前盜匪搶人的地方，但山　過了以後，又是一大片田禾，我眞不信這裏是盜匪出沒之所。</p>
<p>疏濬娥江　修理海塘</p>
<p>抵曹娥鎭，曹娥是漢時的孝女，其父溺江而死，她終夜啼號，躍江索父，結果曹娥昔父浮在水面上，結果她父女均吿斃命了。後人爲了紀念她，把這舜江改爲曹娥江，在江畔復有曹娥鎭。我們下車渡江隔岸，就是百官鎭，相傳禹王曾召百官在此開會，故名。據常地人說：這裏還有一個大舜廟，上虞者即爲舜遺子之意。原來曹娥江叫舜江，也就是紀念舜的意思。這裏已是上虞境界，上虞人　三十萬六千七百〇九人，鄉鎭四二個，全境多山，特產爲棉花，糯米，茶，楊梅與鐵沙。據縣政人員講，前目迫切需要的是疏濬曹娥江，可使農田受益，修理海塘，以保靠海的縣境，修通自百官至縣城的公路，以利商運，現在由上處縣城到百官，須走數十里小路，這自然是應該開通這條路了。</p>
<p>我們登車復向前行，見遠遠地右側有一座高大的山巒，長大而雄峻的，伏在那裏，這就是四明山。據常地老百姓說：四明山山內有山，形勢壯偉，土匪藏身之所，現在餘姚，上虞等地的不安寧，可說是由四明山而起。</p>
<p>行四十公里而達餘姚，這是著名中國大哲學家王陽明先生的故里，也是漢時嚴子陵的家鄉，明時姚江學派朱舜水，黄黎洲兩先生的老家。我們見姚地確是山明水秀，有姚汀橫貫其間，另有兩水相互環抱，山嶺蒼翠，令人喜愛。這裹縣府內即竪有四光生故里的石碑，另有芳潔亭上，置「靴」一隻，誌爲昔汪知事離縣，人民依依不捨，遂留「靴」紀念。「靴」磅置一匾，上書「民不能忘」，可見餘姚人士確能辨識好官。</p>
<p>鹽業派員　赴省請願</p>
<p>餘姚亦爲產棉之區，雖纖雄不够理想，但如加以好好改良，還大有辦法。目前最重要的問題，莫如治安，因縣境南鄉，即爲四明山之一角。歹徒時常出入，並且這些歹徒，煽動農胞，結夥鬧事，所以今天要淸除四明山的匪徒，必須要從政治着手，也要從循循善誘着手。另一問題，爲鹽塲的糾紛。餘姚的鹽，原供給浙江全省之外，復供給安徽江西江蘇數省人民，年產二百餘担，本來有來購鹽的廠商，廠商爲向董事交涉，董事再着篷長，篷長再着篷戶，篷戶即爲鹽民。廠商與董事之間，自有優惠的默　，只可憐鹽民，却在剝削下生活。這裏鹽民有二萬餘人，　家屬在內，總在十萬人以上。在戰前，餘姚的鹽塲，設有塲知事，後來經縣政人員的努力，才將這個不良的制度改善過來。易知事爲塲長，並不必董事轉介其間，由鹽民直接售與鹽商，但習慣是一時不容易改渦來的，事實上依然有很多的困難。抗戰前一年，商人以六折收鹽，激起鹽民的反對，後來才算不折不扣的收購，今天已不是鹽商制了，而由鹽務管理局來辦理，聽說最近　管局因恐收購價格過高，影響外銷，所以貶低收購的價格，而鹽民因生活難以維持，要求加價，這樣地堅持着了。一直到現在，還沒有解决。縣裏鹽業中人，已派員向省鹽管局請願，或還要到南京去請願。</p>
<p>此地鹽的製法，還是千百年前的舊方法，把鹽坦扒成不平，潮來後將海水放入，潮退後將士刮起，放在堆上，用水灌入鹽洞，再將鹽滷流入缸內，以後取出來，再放在鹽板上，讓太陽曬乾發白，旋即成鹽。</p>
<p>鹽民生活淸苦，住的是矮不及身的茅屋，吃的是稀飯，如果不想法改良，餘姚的鹽是很少有希望的了。我們希望鹽管局一面購征，一面要技術上予以指導和改良，要使鹽民的生活達到水準，道才算負起了責任。</p>
<p>我們曾去訪問陽明先生的故居僅有一座新建伯的石牌坊，房屋已蕩然無存了。登龍泉山，先到龍泉寺，這是遜淸光緒元年的建築物。廟貌廟內均極完好、女尼數人管理此寺。再循寺邊小道，拾級登山，爲龍泉書院，相傳王陽明，朱舜水，黄黎洲都曾經在此講學，但據縣志載稱，為乾隆時知縣劉長城所建。院前還有橫額，而院內樓房，僅存殘軀敗骸，瓦礫遍地，緬懷先賢遺址變成了荒廢的地方，不勝感慨。聽山上人說：「這是敵人毀壞的」。我們想到敵人的用心如此狠毒，怎可讓我們饒恕他們呢？</p>
<p>龍泉書院右側，有謝公祠為明時大學士，再右側為嚴公祠，嚴子陵先生的遺像塑在那裏，而所敷顏色，業已斑剝，嚴先生頷下的鬍　，亦只哦零落的幾根了。祠門已毀，僅有幾個作錫箔的婦人，還在製作錫箔，陪伴嚴先生的凄凉寂寞。隔數步，即有龍泉，泉水尙淸。</p>
<p>再由荒草蔓徑闢路而登高，始見陽明祠，亦殘廄不堪，陽明先生的石像爲日本人搬走，現在僅存石桌和石座了。</p>
<p>登龍泉山山巓四望，見四明山聳立在龍泉山的西南。姚江如帶，餘姚縣城伏在山脚的兩面。我們見這河光山色，知道人才輩出，我們希望好好地建設起來，以承先賢遺志。</p>

<h3>評：「樂園思凡」</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>越劇「樂園思凡」是一個古裝劇，但我不想去證明它在歷史上有多少價値，所以這劇在歷史上是否有眞實性，我不想說什麽。我只願意談談它的演出部份和演員是否演出了劇中人的性格。</p>
<p>除了話劇，電影舞蹈和音樂之外，我不喜歡看任何形式的雜劇。但是到了上海以後，我却破天荒地看了越劇「祥林嫂」和這次的「樂園思凡」。以地方戲的地位和身份演出「祥林嫂」，我不能不客觀地承認它是個優秀的演出，因爲它所演出的戲的內容是有意義的。然而這次的「樂園思凡」里有些什麼呢？是描寫有錢的公子哥兒玩弄貧弱的女孩子呢？還是描寫愛情不容分讓，或是一個妒婦的心思呢？假使這些都不是的話，還能說出什麼呢？若是「思凡」就是它的主題，那麼，劇中並沒有寫出是爲了什麼思凡，和「思凡」的動機以及前的寂寞情形。因此，我們可以說：「樂園思凡」是一僩沒有完整主題的戲。</p>
<p>佈景，找覺得比「祥林嫂」的有了進步，在「祥林嫂」里的佈景是不統一的；這裏，已經統一了。但是佈景情調統一了之後，並不能算是成功，因爲每一景的氣氛還沒有顯出來。例如：第二幕是表示魚玄機勾欄院中的客堂。這一景無法使我們看出是一個高等的窰子。假使我們不看說明的話，很可能把它當作其他所在。又如：第四幕是表示魚玄機做了女道士，住的咸宜觀的練室。在景裏我們也無法看出它是一個修道之所。假使在說明上把這一景寫作勾欄院也未嘗不可！這可以說是全劇中代表劇中主人翁不同的身份，兩個最明顯和最重要的環境。但可惜的是佈景設計者和導演者並沒有注意到這點。</p>
<p>演員　·已定型·</p>
<p>演魚玄機的是袁雪芬，她曾經在「祥林嫂」的說明書中寫她自己只是演某一種型的「且」。那麽，就是說：除了這一類型的「且」以外，都不是她所能演的角色。所謂性格，那是沒有的事。所以，我對她所演的性格是否眞實和是否被具體的表現出來，想不苛求！但是，在編導人洪鈞的「樂園思凡怎麽寫起來的」文中，却把這性格寫得很明白，他寫：「她有一個過高的理想，」切生活的希望都建築在這個理想上。她低估現實，忽視現實，結果現實給她帶來了痛苦。…她失去了少女的熱烈（這也許是個「情」字）坦白的胸襟，換上了冷寞變態的少婦的性情。……她並不追求虛榮，她不過希望過高，又始終沒有和社會惡勢力奮鬥一下，她始而忽視，旣而逃避，結果是變成了乖僻，終于犯罪。」劇作者雖然說明了是這樣的一個性格，但是在劇中我沒有看出演員的演技是能够表現這些個性的。袁雪芬所介紹給我們的魚玄機，只是一個被欺騙被玩弄的可憐虫！對於忽視現實，少女的然情，少婦的性情，變成了乖僻等性格的一部份，我一絲也沒有看到。所以，假使不談「且」，而談性格的話，那麽袁雪芬是整個的失敗了。苛刻的說：魚玄機的成就只及祥林嫂的十分之二三·這些，導演人也得負責任，不論這位演員是怎樣的紅，都該給予嚴厲的指正，使她更有成績才對！因爲這不是個人的事，而整是個越劇界的光榮！</p>
<p>這次的音樂比「祥林嫂」時的配音好得多了。雖然它還是那麼的單純和悄調上的不統一，但它已經是配合了劇情，不是那種雜亂無章的樣子了。</p>
<p>很多先進者們都說它好，那是以先進者的身份在鼓勵這些後起的，有希望的藝人！並不是對這些尙未趕上最高藝術水準的越劇，感到滿足的表示！</p>
<h3>演員與演出</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>演劇是粽合的藝術，劇作家，導演，舞台设计者，音樂家，服裝設計者和演員，每個人都把自己所有的一部份藝術力量，呈獻在整個的演出中，使演劇藝術更加發揚起來，擴展了演劇的效果。</p>
<p>但是這所參加的各部門，不是爲個人的表現而出現，而是爲集體表現出一圓滿的戲劇效果。如果任何一部份把創造的職務據爲己有，那就會損害其他組成部份的創造力，而戲劇就會失掉流利，圓潤和自由；與此密切相聯的，就會失掉對觀衆的說服力。參加藝術過程的每部門，只有在演劇藝術的規律所限定的條件內，自由而不拘東的從事創造，並且要得到其他各藝術部門積極的合作，戲劇才能獲得一種結構上的和諧與完整。</p>
<p>如果劇作者堅持劇本只能由默讀來欣賞，那麽劇本就成爲不能上演的了，且與其他文學沒有分別。如果舞台美術家爲表現「單一意志」，則演劇成爲供人看的畫面，而演員變成了傀儡。如果導演爲滿足「自我意念」，强制獨裁，則演員成爲機械，演劇成了無味的勞役，如果明星壟斷了戲劇，則其他的演員都被犧牲了，而觀衆在演出巾，也將瞧不出整個的劇本。所以這畸形的個人主義的產物，任何一部份爲單一自我滿足而侵犯了他部份的創造，都會引起整個戲劇的破壞，或减低藝術水準。</p>
<p>但是有一點是應該注意的，在演出中劇作家，導演，舞台設計者，音樂家等都不是直接的訴之於觀衆，而且通過演員向觀衆說話的。每種技術都把它的思想交給演員，以便演員把這些實現出來，否則這些思想將、永遠沒有生氣。劇作家的那些言語，如果演員不賦與它們生命，不使它們成爲自己的語言，將依舊是死東西。一幅美麗的布景擺在舞台上，如果沒有經演員的肉體與感官接觸過，亦將成爲沒有生氣的東西，因爲這一切在舞台上被賦予了生命，這才是有戲劇性，才有了意義。因此一個劇本不同於一首詩或小說，一幅舞台而不同於一幅繪畫，一個舞台裝置不同一個建築工程，舞台音樂，不是其他音樂的演奏。當每種藝術參加到演劇創造中，必須戀成演劇的條件，執行一種戲劇的職務，在完成這種職務當中，每種藝術具有一種新的性質，即負有一種演劇目的性質，要適合戲劇動作的需要，故不同於它們原來專門化的東西。所以演出之各部門參加到演劇工作裏來，他們不得不改變了原來單獨工作的面目，將自已適合於演劇的一部門，他們不但是間接的將戲劇的內容，思想以及情緒表達出來，而且是幫助演員的表演，烘托劇情，增加演出的成功與效力，使演劇的表現力成爲更豐富，更完整，更優美的東西。牠們統一起來，融化成爲一個整體，變成不能分開的了。因此今日的演員，已經不能離開舞台藝術其他各部門而獨立存在，在在都成了劇塲藝術中不可缺少的要素了。</p>
<p>作者擬將敎學崑曲之進度，按照作曲譜曲度由方式之不同，分為十二等分。即一，南曲散板，二，南曲一板三眼有贈板者，三，南曲一板三眼無贈板者，四，南曲一板一眼有贈板者，五，南曲一板一眼無贈板者，（以上均包括南集曲）六，南曲流水板，七，北曲散板，八，北曲一板三眼，九，北曲一板一眼，十，南曲套數，十一，北曲套數，十二，南北曲合套。</p>
<p>以上十二等分即爲作者擬編之「崑曲敎範」一書內容十二章之名稱。每章選比較常見之曲牌四五曲爲例。每一曲牌則至少選曲二支或二支以上，以資比較。其有詞牌與曲牌相同者，先錄詞一首，俾明詞曲之異同，與由詞入曲之過程，是爲一課。曲文與工尺旁譜爲正文。於正課之後，並就本課有關術語及學理，逐條加註說明，並列示習題數則，以資習作。</p>
<p>如是編製，全書共約六十課，錄散曲百支，整曲十五套。以窺曲海之全豹，雖僅太倉之一粟，但此百支十五套之格律板式，當可熟習。至於作譜之方式，則以每一曲牌錄曲二支或二支以上，自可比較而得之。由此再進一步，爲第二第三第四乃至第數十個循環之硏習，則曲學之　　，不難探索而得。</p>
<p>本書第一章南曲散板，擬錄鷓鴣天，謁金門，念奴嬌，紅衲襖，不是路五個曲牌爲例，分爲五課，其中前三者爲南詞引子，後二者爲南詞過曲。茲擬第一課編例如次：</p>

<p>由於上舉膾炙人口之詞一首曲二支，比較而觀，詞與曲格律之異同，可得而窺見焉。鷓鴣天爲七絕二首所組成，惟下闋第一句七字句，分裂爲平仄仄與仄平平之三字句兩句，此詞與曲相同者也。曲可加襯字而詞不可，此不同者一也。曲尙眞率，以本色語見長。而詞重辭藻，此不同者二也。詞爲作者抒寫個人情感之作，而曲則代劇中人發言，此不同者三也。此雖爲最初步最膚淺最顯著之認識，但由此多讀名人作品，即可爲作曲之嘗試。</p>
<h3>狗明星賴茜萬里尋幼主</h3>
<p>— 蔭槐</p>
<p>英國的克郡有個孩子，他有條美麗的犬，名字叫賴茜。他們相依爲命，親如手足。每天下午四時，孩子散課，賴茜便本能地去接他回家。但是，一天，主人因着失業貧困，把它賣給了公爵。它所遭遇到的，便再也不是溫暖友愛，而是鐵籠，鐵鍊與殘暴。</p>
<p>它掙扎着脫逃，一次，二次。最後雖然被帶到了蘇格蘭，它終於還是掙脫了公爵家奴才的魔掌。爲着對舊主的眷戀，它不顧一百餘英哩是多麽遙遠的距離，向着家鄕奔駛。這是一次艱苦的旅程，跋涉崇山峻嶺，浮泳過急流大川。雷雨的襲擊，暴徒的射獵，捕犬者的追逐…它不顧一切，只是向家鄕邁進。</p>
<p>終於，在一天午後的四時，拖着跛了的前足，疲乏骯體的身子，回到學校樹蔭下的老地方，守候着含淚相迎的幼主。</p>
<p>這眞是一張感動的影片，孩子所給予的是友愛溫暖，賴茜報答的是忠心。你看它只要一息尙存，此志不渝，有那一種困厄阻止得了它，有那一個人的小惠能在沿途留得止它。全部戲的重心集中在賴茜，那位狗明星。它也的確很會演戲。它表演失望，疲乏，垂斃，重傷等等姿態，自然而逼眞，像一位大演員。</p>
<p>畫面極美麗。英國平靜的原野，雷雨，日出，瀑布…給全片添增了不少詩情畫意，添增了情感。</p>
<p>聯美影片公司武使權威片「亂世劍俠」，是小范朋克的得意傑構。一人兼飾兩角，同時在一個鏡頭中出現比劍，開銀幕未有之奇觀。全片情節，熱烈緊凑，得未曾有，過去映過的武俠片，沒有一部可以比得上。該片定於八月廿七日在滬光新光同時獻映</p>
<h3>現在的話劇</h3>
<p>— 迀夫</p>
<p>昨天和一位戲劇朋友談起話劇的現象。大家都覺得話劇的危機眞的來了。因爲每次的演出都在喊賠本，爲了賠本就無法再使話劇演出。因此影響到話劇的生存。</p>
<p>只要我們打開報紙來看看，上海的劇團何止百家。這一百個劇團裏只有十分之一弱的是話劇團體，其他的只是些申曲，越劇，國劇，有的甚至是滑稽戲和攤簧之類的東西。那麽，爲什麽只有話劇會虧本呢？其他那些不成材的劇團爲什麽反而能站直呢？原因很簡單，因爲他們只是逕弄觀衆，迎合觀衆，或是賣弄色相和低級的興味，使一般小市民容易陶醉在他們的無聊的趣味裏。而話劇呢？它是一個嚴肅的，水準高的，有深度的，走在時代前面的眞正的藝術品，而且票價也比較高，一般小市民旣不易接受其藝術，又無法購票入塲。因此，它的每决演出就要賠本了。</p>
<p>那位朋友說：上海的戲劇朋友選一個劇本，第一步先看有沒有生意眼。而重慶來的戲劇朋友選劇本的第一眼，是問意識是不是正確的。這裏就有了一個區別，所以上海朋友打秋風戲可以賺金條，而重慶來的劇團則大多數賠本。這話是不是可靠，那不知道，但我覺得這原因並不是勝利以後開始的，遠在敵僞控制之下，這　戲劇朋友不得不如此做，吾則，日本人要請他們去坐牢。據說：「蛻變」的演出就被勒令停演過。年月一久長，就把話劇觀衆養成了只圖眼睛舒服，不管腦子是否空虛。因此，在上海演劇就有了現在這樣的危機。有此敵僞時代的話劇觀衆因爲不能接受現在這種意識深刻的話劇演出，都改變作風跑到電影院去看美國電影。有些對外國片子不感興趣，水準比較低的觀衆，也都跑進了越劇塲和滑稽戲的塲子裏去了。使話劇塲的觀衆减低了數量！</p>
<p>話劇雖然是這樣的不景氣，但我們這些話劇工作者，除了少數以外，還不想改變作風，去作降低水準的演出！</p>
<p>本適特別好的片子還是少，沒有可以超出「義犬尋主」的。</p>
<p>就滑稽片的導演而論，這部片子是選的，可是演員未見精彩，亞博强硬，考司坦羅仍屬老樣，不過笑料發生得還自然。兩人同吃一客點心時，考司坦羅第一次點菜甚佳，以後幾次未免畫蛇添足。片前加映「世界入引擎最大飛機」新聞片甚佳。</p>
<p>劉別　在這片中未見特色，色彩也平凡得很，開幕陰曹的一景色彩確很好，唐亞曼契遠遠而來，尙不壞。惟對「閻王」以不拍正面爲佳，因爲多拍背影可以收得更大效果。</p>
<p>女角琪恩泰妮演來比唐亞曼契爲佳，祖父却爾斯可本甚好。</p>
<p>導演把全片的氣氛雖壓得嫌沈但處理還不壞，開堪的約翰迦飛爾在火車窗對窗形影自語亦很新頴，但是十分特出之點却沒有找到。</p>
<p>演員在全片中三個主角都算盡力的，約翰迦飛爾有很多的面部特寫，尙稱職，瑪琳奧冷拉比「血海爭雄記」成功，　脫斯里査也相當不壞。</p>
<p>全片的缺點就是因爲導演處處把戲壓得很沉就缺少起伏的特點。編劇片的綫索缺少强</p>
<p>却爾斯勞頓在此片中沒有多大成就，那是導演挑不起却爾斯勞頓，全片應該很有內心戲可看，但是結果却看到的很少，編劇導演都是失敗，祇是最後一景獨前投案攝得還好，其片影字幕就是從此蛻變而來的，所以也不壞。</p>
<p>白蓓闌史丹妃在此片中是另一作風，演來不壞，的確是老資格。與麥可爾夏在酒櫃旁談話的一塲演來爐火純靑。全劇綫索尙欠嚴密，導演手法亦少變化，麥可爾夏沒有成功。</p>
<p>不過，由此片看到美國劇壇上的「低級」並不輸於我們的「文明戲」。</p>
<p>演員中最好的幾個：</p>
<p>（一）却爾斯勞頓，在「殺妻報」中</p>
<p>（二）白蓓蘭史丹妃，在「劇壇陰雯」中</p>
<p>（三）約翰迦飛爾，在「沉淵」中</p>

<h3>記張定和作品演奏會</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>張家一門都是文學藝術迷，他們祖上合肥張樹聲在前淸是做大官的；因此他們是所謂書香後代，照遺傳學講，是有智識份子的傳統的。他家四個姊姊：元和·允和·兆和·充和；六個弟弟：宗和·寅和·定和·宇和·寰和·寗和。姊姊都是兩條腿，弟弟都是寳蓋頭。抗戰期間，他們姊妹弟兄，流轉各地，但仍編訂抄本刋物，輪流郵寄。我曾在立煌安徽學院與宗和同事一年半，看到他們的家庭刋物「水」，這是二姊寫的詩，她害了懷鄕症，就以此爲題，三姊的外子沈從文和孩子虎雛都有大作在上面。書末訂有規約：一，收到刋物的人須將他的近作附在裏面；二，刋物到後，一星期以內請寄與某人。這的確很有趣。現在抗戰勝利了，姊妹弟兄們都到上海來了，便舉行了一次十姊弟的歡宴，我因曾做過兆和宗和的老師（在中國公學敎他們小說原理和現代世界文學），又與元和允和充和是曲友或虹社社友，關係密切，也被邀加入。定和還拍了好幾張照片。</p>
<p>二十日定和在逸園舉行歌曲演奏會，邀約他的朋友們去聽曲。宗和早就向我談起，他的弟弟定和在後方作歌曲很有名；他起初只喜歡西洋音樂，後來居然也喜歡崑曲了，覺得崑曲也有它的好處。宗和現任蘇州樂益女子中學校長，也趕來參加音樂會。充和大的還在蘇州，她對於崑曲的樂理甚有研究，在女曲友中是少有的。她的「驚夢」「痴訴點香」都演得極好。她在重慶時，曾爲國立編譯館募捐，義演過「學堂」和「遊園」。</p>
<p>我與內子同去，看見鄭振鐸李健吾徐調孚吳祖光丁聰李一鳳子等人都到了。沈從文和兆和站在看客台上，說是學習做招待。</p>
<p>這一晚所唱的話劇插曲有：郭沫若的「棠棣之花」，田漢的「復活」，吳祖光的「正氣歌」和「鳳風城」，顯一樵的「岳飛」，奧斯特洛夫斯基的「大雷雨」以及某君的「大潛山」。其中我最喜歡田漢的歌詞。替「大潛山」作詞的是允和，「巢湖湖水淸，桃鎭血花紅，」她大約在重慶又害懷鄉症了。吳祖光的「正氣歌」用的是牛希濟詞「生査子」。</p>
<p>我對於音樂完全是外行，從文說定和是音樂迷，我相信能迷一定能精。像「求你晚一點動手」「後湖春暮」「藝術戰壕頌」「大潛山合唱」都很好聽。「江南昔日風光好」描摩由喜到怒，「還鄕行」描摩快樂情况，都能用樂譜表現出來。</p>
<p>我對定和有三個希望：第一，創作器樂曲，可以不受唱者吃調和文句的限制。第二，多作一點「力的表現」的樂曲，顯示陽剛的美。第三，下次開音樂會時，合唱樂隊人數須儘量增多，兩三個人似乎太單調了。</p>
<p>這一次所唱的詩詞有岳飛的滿江紅，新詩人陳夢家的「燕子」等。錢風的散文詩「母親的心」是對於「有了妻子忘了娘」的人一個很好的諷刺，設想亦妙。</p>
<p>我覺得男高音朱崇懋唱得很好。女高音曾憲恩也唱得不壞，似乎還不够亮，也許是受了譜的限制。祟懋把「時光」改唱「時間」，與「晚一點」押韻，不知這一首「求你晚一點動手」是全部用江陽押韻的。</p>
<p>寰和·宇和·允和都作歌詞，元和·兆和·宗和等任招待，可說是張氏十姊弟全部動員。</p>
<p>演奏了一大半，呂恩也趕來聽，新近呂恩在南京爲了周彥（賀孟斧修改）的「桃花扇」中有牡丹亭「遊園」二曲，（先唱好姐姐，後唱皂羅袍）曾請浦西園敎這兩支。聽說此劇在重慶上演時，允和每晚去唱，都由丁聰吹笛；因此想起文藝協會的一次文藝欣賞會，丁聽爲我吹遊園，吹完一拱手，笑着下台，那神情最天眞，有趣。</p>
<h3>嘉陵江之夜　嘉陵江散曲之二</h3>
<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>夜裏，嘉陵江的水聲變得更凄切，陰沉的浪濤聲，嗚咽地迴旋着，像深閏的怨女，對着那星光澄澈的夜空，對着那明月之夜，發出了輕微的歎息。像一個懷念丈夫的少婦，在風雨飄搖的晚上，低低地啜泣。</p>
<p>夜裏，嘉陵江兩岸的燈，像夜空裏疏落的星星，散佈在山巓水演。從江灣裏，閃耀着數點漁火，夜的安靜，給漁人們帶來了恬適，從恬適的的休息裏，消減了整天的痰憊。</p>
<p>當夜的脚跡已佈滿了嘉陵江時，嘉陵江岸邊的小鎭，便開始陷人了寂靜的空氣爽，小店的門，都開始關閉了，夜風吹滅了鎭上的燈光，把白晝裏嘈雜的人聲，吹向山之谷，水之濱，只給這江岸上的小鎭，留下了凄淸和冷落。</p>
<p>在屋簷的蔭蔽處，橫躺着一兩個乞丐，一堆州令亂的稻草和幾片破爛的棉絮，造成了他們休息的處所。有時，他們翻一個身，發出那哀求般的囈語。</p>
<p>在幽靜的馬路上，野犬們成羣結隊的奔馳着，有時，牠們望着遠處的燈光在吠，有時爲了爭奪一根枯骨或一片臭羊皮而互相撲咬，有時，牠們也快樂地跑向那荒凉的古墓區。跑向那矮林的深處。</p>
<p>像國靈般的更夫，提着一蓋紙糊的小燈，從深巷中踱了出來，把短小的木棒，一聲聲地敲打在竹简上，從街的這端走向那端，給人們報吿出一個不甚準確的時刻。一雙沒有後跟的破鞋，必達…必達的踏在街石上，和小蟲的鳴叫聲相應。</p>
<p>夜已深了，嘉陵江的流水聲愈更陰沉，嘉陵江岸邊的小鎭愈更冷落，人們火都睡覺了，只有幾個酒醉歸來的漢子和一些在馬路上散步的人們，還在這冷落的街道上踱着。</p>
<p>在街道的旁邊，有一兩個買炒米糖開水的曲背老年人，正慢慢的在街邊上行走，有時，他們也放下那裝滿了開水的大鑌鐵壶和放置碗器炒米糖的舊竹籃，坐在街石上，埋着頭，用力地掮燃壶下而的炭火。當一個黑影在馬路上出現時，他便提高了噪子喊着「炒米糖開…水…」，直到黑影已消逝在屋角的轉彎處時，他才失望的垂下頭，看一看壶脚下的炭火，然後又提起了水壶，提起了竹籃，走向了另一個地方去。</p>
<p>有時，當我在深夜裏醒來時，微風正吹着我的窗子，在這冷落的嘉陵江畔的小鎭上，還響着炒米糖開水的叫賣聲，從街的這端走向那端，又慢慢的從遠處走了過來，凄厲的叫賣聲，像寒風掃着深秋的枯葉，又掠過了瘦削的樹梢，凄凉，悲慘，像深夜裏誰在那冷落的小鎭上呼號，哭泣。</p>
<p>天快要亮了，旅行者們開始在馬路上出現，賣熟雞蛋的，賣豆漿油條的，也在街邊上擺起木架，用親切的聲音向旅客招攬。</p>
<p>嘉陵江漸漸在陽光下蘇醒過來，嘉陵江岸上的小鎭也逐漸變得活躍，變得喧嘩，這喧嘩的聲音，這奔騰的嘉陵江水，正在慢慢的醞釀，慢慢的製造，給嘉陵製造成另一個凄切的悲慘的夜。</p>
<h3>春祭</h3>
<p>— 蕭斧</p>
<p>灰黯古老的小城暴露着砲火的瘡痍，彷彿一個癱瘓病者裎裸着他底患着可憎的頑癬的軀體；鳳凰底新生終是個美麗的神話，廢墟上並沒蓋起屋宇，却被荒蕪的蒿萊和濘清的苔蘇長遍了。袋老的孱弱的人們，帶着菜色和襤褸，喘息在刺刀底餘悸和貧困底煎熬裏。「天亮了」僅是個朦朧的希望，漸漸幻減了的是恢復舊日生活的一塲短促的春夢。</p>
<p>一路上有老婦人們在我背後指點着，竊竊地耳語着，分明是在談論着我底歸來。街坊們驚喜地招呼我，推算着我離鄉的歲月，引起了無謂的爭執；她們問起我底妻子，問起我有了幾個孩子，說我好福氣，歎息我母親底已經過世，她不能抱到孫子的遺憾。我感謝她們底關切，但一點也不高興。她們泛濫着的是隔靴搔癢的同情。她們全不知道我把多麼沉重的一副担子挑在肩頭，我挑了它走了多久，至今不能歇下來喘息。我沉緬在回憶裏，那時候我是多麽年靑，多麽像一頭初生之犢似地有生氣；但嚼着生命底苦汁，我漸漸地感到了自己底疲倦和衰老。我幾乎把她們溫暖的股勤看做　膩的阿諛。簡短地回答着她們底問語，我匆匆地走</p>
<p>遠遠地看見那斑剝的園墻和枯朽的大門時，輕微地襲擊我的是一種童年的回憶：問年一次的在盛夏時將門窗油得光亮，像維持一個家庭底聲譽似地，同時不懈地粉飾着它底外表；這時候，我和弟妹們往往樂於分担一點輕鬆的工作，用破筆蘸着桐油塗上蠣殼窗扇底竹格。但經這悠長的歲月，它們被風霜剝蝕而衰敗了，道不正是反映了我家境底枯榮，和這屋頂下的每個人生活底甘苦。即使有一天能重又修飾一下這門楣，我往何處找尋那消逝了的童駿底樂趣呢？</p>
<p>父親底牙齒愈加豁，背愈加傴僂了，他消瘦的相貌變化得這樣厲害，和我記憶中的印象起了多大的差異。印象往往是靜止的，孩子似乎永遠是孩子，而老人也似乎永遠是他往日般老，使我們久別重逢時，驚詫得幾乎不敢置信：「啊！你老多了！」我給時間無情地播弄了。三十年敎書匠底生涯，他給課卷弄花了眼，嘔盡了神思，給書桌磨破了多少件衣衫底袖管！</p>
<p>「你回來了，好的，總算回來了！」他像歇下一副重担似地輕鬆而愉快。他絮問着我底妻孥，垂詢我們旅途底平安。他吿訴我芸叔曾爲我們底安全扶過乩，說途巾有風險；芸叔問怎樣　能解脫這命定的災厄，乱仙指出了三個字：誠信佛。父親原非韓昌黎底信徒，就天天默誦幾十遍阿彌陀佛。現在聽說我們坐的船在長江裏遭遇風浪，因此在馬當附近泊過一整天，他就惕然而又釋然地說：「是的，是的；不可全信，也不可不信。念念佛不傷什麼神，君子問災不問福。」</p>
<p>下一天是族中底春祭；這次回家打算住的日子不多，正好借此見見族人，省得一家家走訪，我算是無心趕上了。</p>
<p>宗祠是在城隅底荒僻處，年久失修，破爛得不堪蔽風雨了，門窗早給駐軍和難民們拆去舉炊，空敞敞地像個牙齒脫畫的老人怪相地張着憔悴的口腔。庭院中野草沒脛，守祠的老贓也無心去鋤刈，蒙着雨水、漉漉地弄濕了人底衣履。族人們打着雨傘，陸續地到了。我不知道這戰亂的幾年裏春秋雨祭底情况，但比之戰前，是多麼凄凉和寂寞。看樣子，多半是來應個景，在三月不知肉味的日子裏圖一餐可口的酒食。族長，我底叔祖，穿得還體面，刻版地拿出他近作的詩稿給人欣賞，詩中有一聯用綠　對着紅羊，可見在兵荒馬亂的年頭他還能常日飲一杯佳釀，晚境是比較過得去的。父親和兩三個叔伯們穿得有些寒酸，其餘的簡直該說襤褸了。其中一位我底從兄，穿着一件窄短的長衫，滿是油膩和補釘。我問他近來做什麼生涯，他赧顏而顳願道：「不成話說，不成話說！」有人背地裏吿訴我這位從兄幾年來多半是靠沽衣過活。想想在他手頭進出的多少衣服裏竟不能挑選出一製合身而入眼的衣衫留給自己，就可見他這行業底微賤和日子底酸苦了。族人到得這樣寥落，恐怕有的正爲了謀衣謀食，奔走外鄕；有的留在家的，也因羞於貧窶，運一頓酒食底諉惑也無法打消他怯於見人的自尊，寗可躱在自己屋裏嚼菜根和稀飯吧？</p>
<p>祭禮開始了。襄禮循例唱着三次獻爵和上香，他們底聲音是如此的低弱而悽愴。輪着行輩跪拜的人，草率而急遽地磕着頭，大家全無一絲虔敬和鄭重。人情薄如紙，即使子孫對列祖列宗也還是如此；大凡日子過得溫飽的時候，纔能想到前輩創業底艱難，而對他們感激和虔敬；現在當着這十來塊標明着「解元」「明經」和「拔貢」之類的，斑剝和塵昏的，佈滿了蛛網的匾額，子孫們愼終追遠的一點孝思也早就烟消雲散了。</p>
<p>菜肴是這樣的簡單，而酒味是這樣的薄；但大家却誇贊着族長辦事底認眞；因爲宗祠底田產微薄得可憐，在米珠薪桂的今天，辦三桌酒食幾乎要貼錢，席間有人談起什麽人家辦喪事，一口平常的棺木就化了一萬幾千萬新票，說要是老年人偏偏挑這年頭去世，簡是是跟自己子媳們爲難。這雖是句憤世憂時的笑談，但在許多人頷首贊同的神色裏，幾乎竟然流露了自己有着風燭殘年的父母的憂感，而悵恨差過了在往日太平的年月裏就做不孝孤哀子的幸福了。</p>
<p>這多年的干戈和掙扎，使我底宗族所代表的這一階層加速地沒落了。這可憐而可笑的準士大夫階層，過去念幾年畫，識幾個字舞文弄墨，在私塾裏敎書，在衙門裏做帮閒的淸客。一到大動亂的時代，要不能向上爬去充當掀風播浪渾水換魚的小政客，就得跌下貧困底陷阱，在驚濤駭浪裏像一片破船板似地浮沉而腐　。他們肩不能挑，手不能提，深深地中了一襲長衫底毒，而又死勁依戀地不肯脫下這長衫，彷彿瀕臨傾家蕩產的芙蓉君子，至死缺乏戒除煙癮的决心和勇氣。</p>
<p>不能挑着時代底担子走的。必被無情的宿命摔在道旁，委頓轉側在溝壑裏，奄奄地悵望着漸漸遠去的行列後揚起的塵土。我猛然驚惕，在這一階層裏生長的我，是否已毅然擺脫了那件精神上的長衫，打這一階層裏逃出，而有挑着這副分內的担子繼續走去的力量呢？</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風13</p>
<p>「你爺爺給你鬧着玩的吧。」</p>
<p>「眞的，他跟誰都是恁們說。您得閒，給他老人家白撩兩句，準聽得到。」</p>
<p>「你今年才十三歲，敢情沒落地就練武把子？」覺得好笑，不由得打了一個哈哈。</p>
<p>「誰說不是？」這孩子確是道地的東北腔調，開口就是問句。</p>
<p>「嘆…？一外行人絕對不肯相信這種說法。</p>
<p>「以前，我爸爸跟人家鬧氣，給人家打折了一條骼膊；媽去報仇，也叫人家打了。一賭氣，我爺爺練什麽什麽腿，可以破人家氣功。爺爺是俺自己爺爺的師兄弟。爺爺說我媽年紀過哪，練不了。那是一手絕活，過了十五，準練不成。我媽十八哪，又出了嫁，不成。」沒有接下去，瞧他那樣子，好像心思早岔到旁的事上頭去了。</p>
<p>「後來呢？」我提撥了他一句。</p>
<p>「後來…後來…」也許在考慮怎樣說下去。</p>
<p>「後來就有了你了，不是嗎？」我給他把故事接起來。</p>
<p>「對哪…」好像度過了一重難關似的，「可不是…可還沒養我哪，您知道？」</p>
<p>「我明白。」我很愼重其事吿訴他。</p>
<p>「爺爺知道了這回事，就說『行哪，這回可以練了。』打那天就練起—可不是給媽練，是給我練，爺爺說的…」他側過頭來，流動着眼珠，要瞧我究竟是否了解他的話。</p>
<p>這回我眞明白了。大槪是實行所謂「胎敎。」倒是願意聽聽這一段傳奇。</p>
<p>「爺爺叫人盡了許多佛像，一張像一個功夫架子，合起來，一套『達摩祖師行功圖，」—爺爺比劃一個架子，就照那架子畫一張，畫得了，掛滿一問屋子，叫媽看，一天得看幾遍。祗叫看，不叫動。又敎媽學吐納；天沒亮，就得在院子裏打坐，練吐納。還要吃藥，叫什麼『補先天』丸子。</p>
<p>「架子看熟了，爺爺就練給媽瞧，叫媽想着練，可不叫動。想完了，就在院子裏蹓躂，一天要練三四遍，不到一個月，媽全會了，爺爺就問媽的話。媽要是答不上來，爺爺就比劃給媽瞧。爺爺說那都是拳母經，一會百會。</p>
<p>「快要『落草』的那幾天，媽耽起心思來，『單怕養個丫頭』，媽一直嘟噥。爺爺說他倒喜歡丫頭，要是丫頭，爺爺就敎她鐵沙掌，七十二路裙裏腿，先天一　功…什麼什麼。準定報得了仇。</p>
<p>演戲</p>
<h3>給友人</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我穿着一件潔白的綢衣，長垂及地，地上舖滿白色的花朶。有爍閃的亮光，射上來，射到我的胸前，我的兩肩，我的頭頂。啊！我的胸前。佩着那麽一個小小的金色的太陽；我的兩肩，披着那麽一件鑲着金邊的道袍，我的頭頂，戴董那麽一頂嵌滿金星的大帽。我渾身嚴肅，兩眼望着鼻子。彷彿在沉思，彷彿在默　，一步一步，走得很慢，走到一層高高的台前。那台的正中，懸着一輪巨大無比的太陽。台的上而，放着一隻金質的火香爐。香爐裏冒出熊熊的火燄，火燄　噴出濃烈的香氣。我肅然立正，合上手掌，在火燄香氣的練繞中，彷彿到達了上帝的面前，向着那熊熊的火燄，高懸正中的太陽，恭恭敬敬地拜下去，拜下去，再拜下去—這時候，下面的看客「好呵好呵」地唱起來了！</p>
<p>那齣戲的名字叫「失去的星」。是十餘年前某一個聖誕節的晚上，我們女學校裏開慶祝會時演出。在那　戲裏，我飾的是一個年輕的博士，大的算是主角吧？我記不淸了。不過我記得演過了那齣戲的後幾天，有一長者寫了一封信給我，裏面有這樣一句：</p>
<p>「你的戲演得很好，你的戲沒有完，希望你永遠這樣恭慕敬敬認認眞眞地演下去吧！」</p>
<p>這句話是什麽一意思呢？</p>
<p>當時我的年紀太小，不能够懂得這是什麼意思。但是後來，我忽然懂了。我不必吿訴你我怎麽會懂的。不過我要吿訴你，就是因爲我懂得了這一句話。所以到今天，十餘年後的今年，我還能存留在這個多苦多難的世界上。</p>
<p>現在我要向你說另外一些話了。</p>
<p>前天，那麽一個悶熱潮濕的下午，你的信忽然來了。每次見到你的信，我總是歡喜，總是興奮，總是彷彿看見一個長長的人兒，穿着潔白的綢衣，披着命邊的逍袍·戴着金星的大帽，站在一座香烟繚繞的台前，恭恭敬敬地拜下去，拜下去，再拜下去！…</p>
<p>然而這一次，續了你的信，我的乎突然抖了。</p>
<p>我並不希奇你說的「我眞想離開上海」；也不希奇你說的「我的心比不太平時還要不太平」；但是我希奇你說的這一句話：「我對任何人任何事都玩世不恭！」…</p>
<p>「玩世不恭！」…</p>
<p>啊！豈但希奇，豈但驚惶！豈但着急！…</p>
<p>啊！朋友，難道你是在跟我開玩笑？…</p>
<p>不是你的長者，不是你的知己，只是你的一個忠實的讀者，一個未見過而的朋友，今天願意鄭鄭重重把這句寳貴的話轉獻給你：—</p>
<p>「你的戲演得很好，你的戲沒有完，願你永遠這樣恭恭敬敬認認眞眞地演下去吧！」</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>十九日路透社的巴黎電中，述及在和會中我國有兩個女記者甚爲活躍，一爲丁淸璐，一爲徐宗白，譯名其實都錯了。了淸璐係陸晶淸之誤，徐宗白係徐鍾珮之誤。</p>
<p>陸晶淸筆名小鹿，係故參政員玉禮錫之妻，爲我國平期女作家之一，與謝冰心黃廬隱陳學昭等齊名。</p>
<p>陸徐二人均身材短小，體重不越百磅，宜在和會中特別受人注意也。</p>
<p>九月一日記者節，可是報紙並不因此而休刊一日，所以幹我們這一行，比任何一行爲苦。一年三百六十五日，越是到什麼紀念節日，我們越緊張忙亂，對照着别人的輕鬆閒適，更覺得不好受。</p>
<p>並非自怨自艾，實在那頂所謂「無冕王」的帽子令人哭笑不得。</p>
<p>成都來人談，川大重大等校在蓉招考，竟有人集資千萬，串同考試委員會工役，盜出試題，組「講題委員會一，四出向投考人兜售，每題定價二千五百元云云。</p>
<p>這一生意眼，敎授或考試委員並未想出。無怪若干商人會駡書獃子到底是書獃子，即使財神老爺定來，也會不知道打開大門的！</p>
<p>秋風已起，秋意漸露，回想虎列拉今夏的咆哮，總算叨天之幸，死人不多。願虎口餘生的人，此時格外保重，因爲這個當口，責體內所潛伏的大小委屈，正待向足下淸算也。</p>
<h3>一字之差</h3>
<p>— 爾杰</p>
<p>雅爾達協定美國和蘇聯對條款的解釋大相逕庭，以前日本閣議修改憲法，幣原堅持不必修改，只需加以新的註釋就行。同一字句，解釋不同便妙用橫生，所以孔子作春秋對於一字褒貶也極愼重，因爲稍一不愼，不獨貶他不着，且有被當作擋箭牌的危險。</p>
<p>我們每見報載判決漢奸罰刑之後，常附有一句「全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收，這個「酌」字可就妙用無窮了，酌是酌量情形，全憑人情說話，沒有任何硬性的規定，究竟所謂家屬必需生活費者只限於粗衣淡茶的支出呢，還是除大菜洋房以外尙需加人跳舞汽車等的開支？法無明文、大家好做手脚。</p>
<p>峯個例子說說，李澤自被判決以來，當局似亦以寬容態度對李澤財產末加任何處理或沒收，大槪就是根據酌留的「酌」字罷—而新新公司恐怕李澤的財產尙不够其家屬必需的生活費，所以「仍按月發薪三百餘萬元」也可說酌量情形辦理，即以此案看來，可槪其餘，但他們却可老着面皮說是「依「法一辦理」豈不妙哉！</p>
<p>院判決的主文應當是硬性的規定已無待贅言，我們判決犯人的徒刑，不說酌判數年，而一定要說出幾年幾月來，而對於漢奸財產的處理，却偏用一個「酌」字，豈欲不失「忠恕之旨」？我們對此不能無憾！</p>
<p>十九日大公報載司法行政部對於酌留家屬生活費一點，不久將有規定，我們希望這個「不久」不要拖得過久，而將來規定了以後，對於這些已經「酌留」了的漢奸老爺們又將如何處理？是不是仍以「寬容態度」出之？這點筆者只好賣個關子。「讀者諸君且看下回分解。」</p>

<h3>日行一善</h3>
<p>— 忠彪</p>
<p>先生：每個人應該要日行一善，你們每天有沒有做了些助人救人的事？</p>
<p>學生甲：我眼見工業日趨衰落，昨天我把舅父家裏的十隻美國玻璃杯敲得粉碎，　國貨大打抱不平。</p>
<p>學生乙：先生，我本來不預備讀書的，後來我細想個使我們學生個個都不讀書，那先生不是就要沒飯吃了嗎？因此我大發慈悲心，每天到這裏來捧幾個鐘點塲，爲的是救助你先生呀！</p>
<h3>人生是什麼</h3>
<p>— 胡秀如</p>
<p>（下面是一個十五歲的中學生和他先生的對話）學生：先生，人生是什麽？先生：…一個畫家，他的人生是　圖；一個音樂家，他的人生是作曲；一個醫生，他的人生是治病；一個守財奴，他的人生是賺錢；一個窮兵讀武革人，他的人生是流人血…學生：先生，那麼你的人生該是敎書了！先生：是的，人生在不同的眼光中有不同的解說，因爲有不同，所以人要問那種人生是快樂的，人都喜歡快樂躲避煩惱，但事實上儘是些煩　的事繞着你。學生：我要知道什麽人生是快樂的先生：快樂的人生是由眞，善，美做成的。眞是假的對面，善是惡的對面，美是醜的對面，如果你在日常生活中，不欺騙人，不說謊，打碎了花瓶不說是阿味幹的，那便有了眞。你能設安慰人的話，即如對一個留級的同學加以鼓勵，便有了善，再有你不做過分的事情，譬如趁電車吧；你就端坐一塊合你大小的地方，不佔二個人的坐位斜靠着，你能給人看着順眼，那便是美。學生：我有些懂了。</p>
<h3>人物素描　從「排長」到主席——記萬耀煌將軍</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>現任的湖北省主席，即過去的軍校敎育長萬耀惶將軍。當他一度任陸大敎育長的時候，那些頑皮的學員送給了這位五十歲開外的老中将一個綽號—『萬排長』。</p>
<p>顧名思義，排長職責，按步兵操典二一曰五十一條之明文規定爲：「排長在連長指揮之下，平時盡各種手段，敎育所部士兵，服行各項勤務。戰時依連長之命令或意圖，指揮本排，施行戰鬥。」</p>
<p>換言之，排長無論在平時與戰時，始終與土兵共同生活，朝夕不分，同生死共思難。在訓練方面，排長是最近士兵的官長，士兵的舉動，甚至於吃飯·穿衣·走路·等等，都須要排長隨時隨地的敎導。因爲軍人的吃飯與穿衣走路，都有劃一的規定，甚至連大小便也有一定的位置與一定的時間（出操上課是不准大小便的），所以，排長專門督促士兵的小動作，不分空閒與時間，加以糾正，使之成爲一典型健全之士兵。</p>
<p>中將教長·排長作風</p>
<p>萬　煌將軍任陸大敎育長時就採取當一個「排長」的作風。他曾經說：「愈是細微的事，往往辦不　，軍人時時刻刻要機警周密；所以小的事情要特別留心！」他對於陸大學員，不管是五六十歲的老頭，不管是統帥過成千成萬軍隊的師長軍長，少將及中將，他都一律看待；只要有毛病，給他看到了，馬上糾正。有一次，上課號角響了，一個學員怱怱忙忙從側所裏出來，有一個褲子扣忘記扣了，剛好被「萬排長」見到了，立時訓斥，非要那個學員扣好了再許走。</p>
<p>事後，那個學員就向其他同學宣揚（因他是一個軍長出身），敎育長眞莫明其妙，把我們當三歲小孩子，連扣鈕扣也要管。這間直沒有大將之風度，和排長的樣子差不多了！我們以後不要稱他敎育長，喊他「萬排長」是了。</p>
<p>卅年夏，萬耀　將軍調長軍校，陸大學員在臨時給他一個評語：萬排長調任軍校敎育長，眞是恰其當也。因爲軍校的學生畢業後出來首先要充當排長。</p>
<p>種種問題　令人頭痛</p>
<p>萬將軍調任軍校教育長之後，還是脫不了排長的作風，在校閱的時候，他走到學生而前，用手猛力的撲一下學生的肩膀，然後再問學生：「你的敎育長是誰？」「你的隊長是誰」「你的肩有多寬？」「你的食指有幾公分？」「你從頭到脚垂直的視綫多長？」「從你的敎室到寢室有多遠！」「你的敎室裏有多少窗子？」這一連串極小的問題弄得學生頭暈腦漲，假使學生答不出來，他即刻飭令官長特別訓練這個學生。</p>
<p>在紀念週上，他公開報吿：「昨天在某某地方碰到幾個官長，他沒有和我敬禮，下一次看到絕不允許。</p>
<p>由於道些事實，使年靑的學生，也異口同聲大胆地喊起了「排長。」一天，萬將軍到操塲上來了，一堆學生正歡聲說着：「排長來了。」不料給他聽到了，萬將軍問學生「排長是誰？」「那一個排長來了！」學生默默無言，不敢說出來，後來，萬將軍再三的保證說出來絕不處分，那一個學生才鼓起勇氣說出來「排長就是敎育長」旁邊的學生哄堂大笑。萬將軍自己也忍不住笑了。</p>
<p>如今，萬排長已調任湖北主席了，這也許是他軍校五年「排長」敎育的慶功所致吧！</p>
<h3>小事</h3>
<p>— 小石</p>
<p>敵僞時代，曾將霞飛路更名爲泰山路，同時租界收回，所有捕房，一律也改稱爲警察局，因之：原有嵩山路捕房就更名爲泰山路警察分局。不料勝利以後，當局又將泰山路改名林森中路。自從更改路名到現在，爲時將近一年了，而林森中路的警察分局前面仍縣掛着泰山路分局的牌招，這種措施，實在令人費解。照例警察當局的一切興革精神，都在人民與其他行政機關之前，而今時隔已久名存實亡的這塊招牌，仍懸掛在該局大門口，實在頗足引人談論，未知當局覺察到沒有？</p>
<p>日昨筆者因事，曾二度踄步虹口，曾目睹現在不少高樓大厦，已爲我國軍政機關或官民所營的廠商所居。（是從外面的招牌上看到。）不過該項房屋，在敵偽時代，曾爲敵人所强佔，私自設立什麽倉庫或商號，所以，該項巨幅招牌，如什麽三菱株式會社××倉庫，福島株式會社上海出張所…等等。仍然到處可見。其實，現今屋中之人，旣已全非敵僞中人，則該項招牌，原早加以一律消除，難道費了大力奪回了房屋，而至今連去除一塊招牌的力量，反而沒有了嗎？愛犬如友的包爾，美國經濟平衡局局長。</p>
<h3>跑冷門與投機</h3>
<p>— 楊治福</p>
<p>商業上的買賣有所謂「跑冷門」和「投機」的花樣，就　說商人會找往機會撈進一注貨品，堆囤若千時日後，再以高價售出，或看準市塲正缺少某一種貨品—而這種貨品，又正是大多數人亟待需要的—針對　購買者的心理，而找機會發財。然而，意想不到的，在靑年學生的心目中，也竟有了這同樣的時髦的名詞，他們也懂得了這一套，會鬧這一套，不過，僅是所取的對象和手段不同而已。商人幹的是買賣，學生對付的却是考試，就是說，學生們投考一個學校的時候，會不問自己的志趣如何，而只揀人少的院系報考。因爲他們以爲只要人數少，就容易考試，增加自巳「錄取」的「成然牽」。</p>
<p>我不是一個商人，我更沒有幹過買賣的玩意兒，因此，我無從知道商人們的「冷門」怎麽「跑」，「機」怎樣「投」；但是，我却曾親耳總得學生們的談話。我也曾親眼看到少數的學生，會在報名截止的最末一日，到招考的學校去詢問報名單的號次，査看某系有幾個報名，某些人又報什麽系，看風轉舵，而作「是」「否」報名的打算。</p>
<p>固然，投機投得準，在商人會憑空撈進一大筆「法外財」，加增他們揮霍的程度，生活更過得好點，在學生們，偶爾也會滿足他們的慾望」，僥倖錄取。但有時運氣不好，「投」了個空，商人們不但是傾案蕩產，而會給你套上個「奸商」的罪名，而學生，也適足以養成他們的惰性，到底落得個「名落孫山」！</p>
<p>「僥倖只有失敗」。我們應該不忘記這一句話，同時，我們在事業該上不應玩花樣；對於考試，也一樣的不應該玩花樣。我們應該多用些心思在我們自己的學業上，至少投考一個學校的時候，也應該顧到我們自己的志趣而決擇我們的科系。</p>
<p>最後，還得聲明，我是一個學生，也同樣的正希望着「錄取」的學生，而寫此文的作用，也就是爲了要勉惕自己，勿作　目的「投機」！</p>

<h3>Meeting Between Chairman and Special Envoy Marshall - Exchanging Views on the Current Peace Issues - Also Discussing the Restructuring of the Government</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife visited the Chairman at the official residence at 11:00 AM on the 24th, the first meeting after their fifth trip to Kuling. They also had lunch with the Chairman and his wife. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall and the Chairman exchanged views on the current peace issues, the content of which has not been announced. According to some people here, as long as the Communist Party can abide by the Chairman's August 14th statement, withdrawing from key strongholds that threaten important transportation lines (i.e., the Tianjin-Pukou Railway) and northern Jiangsu, peace negotiations can continue. Special Envoy Marshall's plane has arrived in Xunyang, and he will return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Recent peace talks in Nanjing have discussed specific issues, namely the restructuring of the government and the ceasefire, but without results. The government is quite determined to proactively restructure the government. When Special Envoy Marshall was in Kuling before, he had in-depth exchanges of views with Chairman Chiang on this issue and also telegraphed Zhou Enlai, asking the Communist Party to submit a list of participants in the government. After Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing from Lushan, the three parties, the Nationalists, the Communists, and the Americans, held a series of talks. The Communist Party expressed that it did not refuse to discuss the restructuring of the government. However, the issues such as the President's veto power were far apart from the government's views. Furthermore, the Communist Party stated that the restructuring of the government must be based on an unconditional ceasefire, that is, without discussing the five requirements related to stationing issues previously proposed by the government. The talks stopped there. It is reported that Marshal Marshall's fifth visit to Lushan was to convey this view of the Communist Party to Chairman Chiang and to negotiate with him.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Peace negotiations became quiet due to Marshal Marshall's trip to Lushan. Ambassador Stuart spent the entire day on the 24th without any political meetings.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by the United Press on the 24th] Special Envoy Marshall is thinking of formulating a feasible plan to establish a National Government Committee that accommodates all parties, with a total of 40 members. Ambassador Stuart believes that the whole issue should be set aside, and the war should be completely stopped first, so as to complete the national ceasefire and produce the National Government Committee.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Agence France-Presse on the 24th] According to American sources, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are currently carrying out the work of reorganizing the Chinese government. Special Envoy Marshall firmly advocates that the National Government Committee should be established immediately. This is the first time that Marshall and Stuart have directly dealt with the political aspects of the peace issue. The biggest goal of Special Envoy Marshall's five trips to Kuling is to get Chairman Chiang to establish the National Government Committee. This institution was decided by the Political Consultative Conference to replace the Supreme National Defense Council. At the same time, Ambassador Stuart is currently preparing to establish a five-member committee to seek the resumption of peace talks. In addition to the ambassador himself, the committee will include two representatives each from the government and the Communist Party of China. Communist leaders Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have agreed in principle to participate in the negotiations. However, the government has not yet appointed representatives. Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Communist Party of China, told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that there are only two issues currently awaiting resolution: (1) an unconditional ceasefire; and (2) the restructuring of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If these principles can be implemented, the future of China will truly become bright. If the rock is not moved away, the door cannot be opened.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Disregards Heavy Sacrifices - Reattacking Datong Unsuccessfully - The National Army Defending the City Bravely Counterattacks</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The Communist army is trying to seize Datong, disregarding heavy sacrifices. Now He Long has personally led his 7th Field Brigade, totaling about 1,000 people, with tanks, and arrived at Leigong, about 10 kilometers northwest of Datong, on the 17th via Fengxian. In addition, the main force of Xiao Ke's infantry, more than 30,000, is also moving from western Rehe towards Datong.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The battles on the outskirts of Datong are still very fierce. However, under the brave counterattacks of the National Army defending the city in recent days, the Communist army has suffered heavy losses. The Communist army recently reinforced more than 10,000 people from Yanggao, with more than ten mountain guns and more than twenty mortars, and gathered at Shili Pu, Fanjiagang, and other places east of Datong. They joined the Communist army on the outskirts of Datong and launched another attack. Since the morning of the 20th, the Communist army, under the cover of artillery fire, launched fierce attacks from the east of Datong towards the strongholds of Shachen, Shuiquanwan, and Beiyue Temple, resulting in fierce battles. It was not until the morning of the next day that they were repelled. The Communist army on the north side simultaneously surrounded the National Army strongholds such as the Alcohol Company, Flour Company, and Police School, and launched wave-like charges with dense troops, up to seven times. The National Army fought to the death and finally repelled them. Another unit of about 1,000 people, with three mountain guns, launched fierce attacks from Wohuwan and Baimacheng north of the city on the National Army strongholds at the northern end of the station. After the National Army's brave counterattack, their momentum was slightly frustrated, and they are still confronting each other. More than 2,000 Communist troops have been increased to Shili Dian in the west of the city, and a battle is about to unfold. In addition, in a certain regiment of the Communist army attacking Shachen, the soldiers, due to war-weariness, killed their regimental and battalion commanders and abandoned their weapons and fled.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Since the 23rd, the Communist army has launched a fierce offensive on Shiche Station on the Zhengtai Railway, and fierce battles are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Repelled from Attacking Zouping</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinan by Our Newspaper on the 23rd] On the evening of the 22nd, more than 8,000 Communist troops fiercely attacked the county seat of Zouping from the northeast. The defending troops resisted desperately. By the evening of the 23rd, the Communist troops had been repelled.</p>

A bridge between Mingshui and Puji was blown up. Fortunately, it was not serious. After the railway bureau rushed to repair it, it was repaired at noon on the 23rd, and the trains were not affected.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Battalion Commander in Western Shandong Leads His Troops to Surrender in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jinan by the Central News Agency on the 24th] Lu Fuzheng, battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Regiment of the Communist Army's Western Shandong Military Region, and Zhou Changchen, captain of the Huxi Brigade of the 10th Regiment, dissatisfied with the Communist Party's expansion of internal strife, led their troops to surrender to the Xuzhou military authorities on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northern Henan - Launches Another Offensive - Attacking Hui County and Ji County</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Military news: The Communist army in northern Henan launched a new offensive again on the 22nd, mobilizing 20,000 regular troops, who are attacking Hui County northwest of Xinxiang and Ji County on the Pinghan Railway north of Xinxiang. The purpose is to control the railway section from Xinxiang to Anyang and cut off the supply of the National Army north of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Military news: The National Army recovered Lanfeng, Qi County, and Tongshan on the 21st. Dan County in western Shandong was also recovered. On the 22nd, Sanyi Village northwest of Lanfeng and Luowang Village east of Kaigua were recovered. A large part of the Communist army is now concentrated between Lanfeng and Qi County. Another Communist army unit led by Yang Yong is attacking Minquan. The Communist side stated that in addition to Minquan and Shangqiu, the strongholds from Huangkou to Lanfeng are still in the hands of the Communist army. They also claimed that on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, Xiashi and Chengjialou are still in the hands of the Communist army, and on the Jiaoji Railway, they still hold the strongholds between Zhilanzhuang and Nanliu.</p>
<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Discusses Government Reorganization Issues in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from this city by the Central News Agency] Hui Qi, leader of the Youth Party, went to Kuling to spend the summer. After returning to Nanjing, he suffered from a cold due to climate maladjustment. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before and continued to recuperate. When the reporter visited Mr. Zeng yesterday, he happened to be out seeking medical treatment and did not get an interview. Later, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng received the reporter and talked about the current situation. Mr. Zuo believes that a ceasefire must be achieved first to realize peace, and then a thorough solution can be sought through political means. On this point, he quite agrees with the seven propositions put forward by the "China Times" editorial on August 19 on the issue of reorganizing the government: (1) The nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics should be carried out simultaneously in order to gradually achieve the expected goal; (2) the first priority is a ceasefire in northern Jiangsu; (3) after a ceasefire is truly achieved in northern Jiangsu, the Communist army should automatically withdraw from northern Jiangsu into Shandong. At the same time, both sides should announce a comprehensive ceasefire; (4) the transportation issue should be jointly handled by a committee composed of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, or with the addition of other parties and experts. The troops of both sides should withdraw from the railway line for a distance of a thousand miles, and a period of time should be stipulated to focus only on commercial and civilian transportation and temporarily not transport troops; (5) after the second, third, and fourth points have been truly achieved, the reorganization of the government should begin in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (6) the first task of the reorganized government is to thoroughly reorganize the army in accordance with the army reorganization plan agreed upon by both sides; (7) the work to be carried out simultaneously after the government is reorganized is to re-examine the draft constitution and convene the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Pays Respects to the Chairman - Reporting on the Organization Process of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Minister of National Defense Bai visited the Chairman at 9:30 AM on the 24th and reported in detail on the organization process of the Ministry of National Defense, the general situation of army reorganization in various places, and domestic military intelligence.

At 8:00 PM on the evening of the 24th, the Chairman summoned Minister Bai and Cheng Qian, Director of the Hankou Headquarters, at the official residence and kept them for dinner, accompanied by Yu Jishi.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Kuling by the Central News Agency on the 24th] Minister Bai visited the Chairman again at 9:30 AM this morning and left after an hour.

<h3>Communist Army Relies on Fortifications to Resist Stubbornly - Street Fighting Unfolds in Shaobo Town - National Army on the Outskirts of Xuzhou Recovers Pei County</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiangdu by Our Newspaper on the 24th] On the Grand Canal Line, there was fierce fighting all day today. The Communist army in Shaobo received reinforcements of more than 1,000 people from Gaoyou at 11:00 PM last night. Relying on fortifications, they continued to resist stubbornly. They once rushed into the town. The National Army immediately retreated to defend along the town river. The two armies confronted each other. The fierce fighting started again at dawn today. The National Army exerted the power of its artillery, and the Communist army suffered heavy casualties. However, the rivers and streams there are crisscrossed, and the Communist army has an advantage in terms of terrain. With continued reinforcements, they insisted on not retreating. At 2:00 PM, the National Army gunboats fired artillery from Shaobo Lake, followed by landing. The National Army on the east side also broke through the Communist army's positions after a fierce battle and rushed into the position again. The National Army on the front also took advantage of the situation to attack from Dawang Temple, and the three National Armies engaged in street fighting with the Communist army, which continued until late at night.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiangdu by Our Newspaper on the 23rd] The battle in northern Jiangsu has begun. The National Army was forced to launch a counterattack against the Communist army threatening Yangzhou. At 5:30 this morning, they launched an attack from near Tanu Temple in two routes. The people along the way spontaneously assisted, and they were invincible. The right wing took Qiaoshu as its primary target and recovered it at around 11:00 AM after a brief battle. More than 200 Communist troops in the town surrendered and were captured, and there were also many casualties. The National Army suffered only a dozen or so casualties. The left wing advanced swiftly, and it was not until they approached the outskirts of Shaobo that they encountered strong resistance from the Communist army. The Communist army did not have sufficient firepower, but its fortifications were strong and it still tried to resist stubbornly. The National Army has surrounded Shaobo on three sides. According to a telegram from Xiannu Temple at 9:00 PM, the National Army has entered Shaobo Town, and the Communist army's resistance has been broken.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Pei County in northern Jiangsu, which had been occupied by the Communist army, was counterattacked by the National Army and recovered again by the National Army on the morning of the 23rd. The Communist army retreated south towards Yutai.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The Communist army that occupied Taierzhuang recently fled south to cause disturbances. Fierce fighting is now taking place between the National Army and the Communist forces in the vicinity of Yanzipu and Xiongzhan. The Communist army attacking Hanzhuang, after suffering losses, is now mobilizing large forces in the vicinity of Lincheng and Teng County, apparently intending to launch a large-scale offensive.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Expands the Flood Area of the Grand Canal Again</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] The Communist army expanded the flooded area of the Daguo River near Zhaoduo in northern Jiangsu again on the 21st, extending south to the Bachalu area 14 kilometers south of the railway and north to the Jiakouwei area 10 kilometers north of the railway, expanding by about 30 kilometers, with a water depth of 3 to 4 feet.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin on the 23rd, the water level of the Grand Canal is rising rapidly. As of the 18th, the water level in Qingjiang has reached 2 zhang 6 chi 6 cun, and it is still rising. The dispatch also stated that if the Langjiang and Guashan dams in the Guijiang Dam could be opened, the disaster could be avoided. According to relevant sources, the water situation in the area was clearly caused by the military breaching the dikes. Since the dam is in the Communist-controlled area of Gaoyou, how can the government be blamed? Moreover, the dam is as high as 1 zhang 8 chi, and the Guijiang Dam had already been opened long ago.

<h3>Situation in Northeast Becomes Tense Again - Lin Biao Instructs the Communist Army to Actively Prepare for War - Two Contact Points on the Rehe Railway Line</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Changchun News: The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly tense. The Communist army is actively preparing for war, and the National Army on the China Changchun Railway is also strengthening its defenses. The Changchun-Shenyang area is carrying out clean-up work. The Communist troops in Jilin, Jiaohe, Dunhua, Liangjiangkou, Jiapigou, and other places are said to be mixed with troops from a certain side. Their equipment is the same as the Communist army. The Communist army has recently received a large amount of weapons and supplies. Zhao Shangzhi's and Feng Dang's troops have 40 long-range guns, light and heavy machine guns, and trucks. The mountains in Liangjiangkou and Jiapigou are all fortified and the public is strictly prohibited from passing through. It is rumored that Lin Biao recently instructed the Communist army in the Northeast to establish three base areas: "Manchuria-Korea," "Manchuria-Soviet," and "Manchuria-Mongolia," to prepare transportation, warehouses, weapons, food, clothing, and airfield facilities. Tyson, the American representative of the Changchun Branch of the Military Mediation Department, flew to Harbin on the 23rd to meet with Lin Biao to ease this tense situation.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Transportation News: Tieling, between Siping and Shenyang, was surrounded by the Communist army on the east, west, and north sides on the evening of the 23rd.

<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper on the 24th] Amid the tense situation in Rehe, it is rumored that there have been two contact points along the railway line.

<h3>Director Deng Reports to Reporters on the Situation of Conflicts in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper on the 24th] At a press conference held by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense on the 24th, Director Deng Wenyi reported on the situation of the conflicts and answered questions from reporters. A reporter asked about the strength of the Kuomintang and Communist forces. Deng said that the National Army currently has only 3 million troops, while the Xinhua Daily claims that the Communist army has 15 million. Last month, Chen Yi also told Commander Wang that 500,000 people would reinforce Jinan. Wang replied that soldiers are valued for their quality, not quantity. Deng then said that the Communist army actually has only 600,000 people. In the past, Germany had 10 million troops and Japan had 50 million, but neither of them won. This shows that soldiers are valued for their quality, not quantity. Someone asked how long this war would last. Deng said that it would not last too long. He then said, "You are all young and can watch the changes quietly." Everyone smiled. Finally, Deng told reporters that he would try his best to facilitate the release of information on the war situation to the reporters in the future, and agreed to consider the request of the reporters to go to northern Jiangsu to observe the war.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by the Central News Agency on the 24th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense held a tea party for the press at the Lizhi Society at 4:00 PM on the 24th, hosted by Director Deng Wenyi. He outlined the situation of the conflicts in various places and answered many questions. He declared that the Communist army is actively preparing for a counterattack in northern Jiangsu, and has transferred more than 20,000 troops from Xu Xiangqian's unit from Shandong and 70,000 to 80,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's unit from the Longhai Railway, claiming to "support northern Jiangsu." It seems that there will be a fierce battle soon. In the Xuzhou area, after the recovery of Xishan and Huangkou, the Communist army approaching Xuzhou has been driven far away. He also pointed out that the Communist army on the outskirts of Xuzhou not only has Japanese equipment, but also has Japanese prisoners serving as machine gunners and gunners. On the Longhai Railway, Lanfeng was recovered at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. Of Liu Bocheng's 31 regiments, 13 have been devastated by this battle. In the Shanxi area, Datong is still being bravely defended by the National Army. Deng received a telegram from the political department of the defending army in the city with the words "have confidence." In the Shandong area, the Communist army has not given up its attempt to attack Qingdao. As for the Communist army of about 2,000 people on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, they wanted to flee to northern Shaanxi but have been cut off by the National Army. Overall, the center of the war is gradually shifting to northern Jiangsu, and the Communist army's conspiracy to breach the dikes to stop the National Army has become a bubble due to the receding water. They are transferring troops from Dalian to Shandong to reinforce northern Jiangsu, concentrating on Huaiyin. Their intention is nothing more than to occupy northern Jiangsu as a pretext for negotiation. Director Deng also denounced the atrocities of the Communist army, saying that since the Communist army launched the war, they have forced men and women aged 15 to 45 in the "Liberated Areas" to participate in the war or transport supplies. They forced the people to go to the front to consume the National Army's ammunition, with extremely sinister intentions. The people have no fighting power and flee as soon as they take to the battlefield. People in the old course of the Yellow River along the Longhai Railway have mostly fled as a result, and have nowhere to return. The Communist army's tortures are also endless, such as "dismemberment by five horses" and pouring hot lime water on people and making them stand in it. According to refugees who escaped from the "Liberated Areas," "The people hate the Communist army to the extreme, and are also extremely afraid of them," because they are killed at every turn. However, extremes will turn into their opposites. Recently, people in various places in western Shandong have spontaneously organized to resist the Communist army. More than 10,000 people in Yutai County rose up to defend their homes, fought with the Communist army who ravaged the area, and killed more than 400 Communist troops. More than 10,000 people in the neighboring county of Jinxiang rose up to respond. At this moment, the movement of refugees in Shandong to arm themselves and return home is developing increasingly, and the direction of people's hearts can be seen from this. "The government still hopes that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink. If they still insist on going their own way, it is truly regrettable," he concluded his report with this.</p>

<h3>Democratic League Members Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongshen Are Organizing the Democratic Socialist Party; Jiang Yuntian Discusses the Party's Basic Platform</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from this City] Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongshen, members of the Democratic League, are merging the National Socialist Party, which they lead, with the Overseas Democratic Constitutionalist Party to form the Democratic Socialist Party. An organizing committee has been established, with Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongshen, Wu Xianzi, Li Daming, Xu Chuanlin, and Tang Zhuxin responsible for overseeing the process. A declaration and platform will be released within days. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited Jiang Yuntian, spokesperson for the party, to inquire about the process of forming the party and its basic platform. Mr. Jiang discussed:</p>
<p>The Process of Forming the Party</p>
<p>He said that the Democratic Constitutionalist Party was established in the late Qing Dynasty. Its predecessor was the Baohuang Party (Protect the Emperor Party) organized by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Its members were overseas Chinese, and its headquarters were located in Seattle, USA. After Liang Qichao passed away, the party was led by Xu Qin, and later by Wu Xianzi, until now. The basic political platforms of this party and the National Socialist Party have always been very close. Last year, when Mr. Zhang Junmai went to the United States to attend the San Francisco Conference, after discussions between the leaders of the two parties, the idea of merging and reorganizing was proposed. Recently, Li Daming of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party returned to China, and after concrete discussions, it was decided to jointly form the Social Democratic Party. In addition to the original members of the two parties, some members of the Zhi Gong Party and respected members of society also participated. (Situ Meitang did not join.) As for the relationship between this party and the Democratic League after its formation, it will not be formally decided until a general meeting of representatives of this party is convened in three months. Currently, a cooperative relationship is maintained to achieve the realization of democracy.</p>
<p>Basic Platform</p>
<p>As for the party's basic platform, it is to implement democratic socialism. The goal of socialism is, of course, to eliminate the use of property as a tool for exploitation, but we advocate using a gradual approach, through parliamentary legislation, tax policies, etc., to achieve this goal, just like the British Labour Party. The party does not want to consider adopting violent policies to achieve socialism. Regarding politics, the party advocates implementing direct elections. Every political party must respect the opinions of voters and sincerely serve the people. Regarding local political systems, the party believes that China is a unitary state and should start with local autonomy, but the basic condition is that the central government should absolutely respect political and economic aspects. Regarding the current transitional period of domestic politics, the party fully supports the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and hopes to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible. Regarding the reorganization of the government, the party believes that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must first cease fire and seek unification through peace to eliminate all problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to achieve political democratization. Regarding the reorganization of the army, the party absolutely advocates the nationalization of the army. All national troops should be used for national defense and resisting foreign aggression. Political parties must not privately own troops. He also stated that if the current domestic situation continues to be fought for a long time, not only will the social system be chaotic, but the financial economy will also be unsustainable. In order to maintain its international status after victory, it is necessary to cease fire quickly. As for the suggestion that the Chinese issue be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for joint resolution, we believe that there is no need for this and therefore do not agree, because Special Envoy Marshall's mediation in China is based on the principles decided at the Moscow Three-Power Conference. When asked by the reporter whether the party would be prepared to participate if the government was reorganized, he said: Under the principle of resolving domestic disputes and benefiting the overall situation of peace, we are willing to consider it.</p>
<h3>Civil Servant Housing; Internal Planning Underway; To Be Implemented First in Nanjing Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] It is reported that the internal construction department is planning the issue of housing for civil servants nationwide.

Those who have their own land can build their own houses, which will be returned upon maturity. For lower-level civil servants, the government will allocate funds to build simple and practical houses with water and electricity facilities. Rental prices will be kept as reasonable as possible. It is planned to implement this first in the capital in the spring of the 36th year of the Republic. The budget is about 20 billion national currency, and it is expected to be completed nationwide within ten years.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Trusteeship of Disputed Areas Denied; Minister Peng Strongly Denies Inaccurate United Press and Associated Press Reports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] A Central News Agency reporter inquired with Minister Peng regarding the report in domestic and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, citing a United Press Nanjing dispatch on the 23rd, stating: "Chairman Chiang has agreed to a Chinese proposal to place all disputed areas in China completely under U.S. trusteeship," and similar news transmitted by the Associated Press on the same day. Minister Peng solemnly replied, "This statement is completely unfounded."</p>

<h3>Hubei is Constructing the Xiang River Water Conservancy Project; Funds of 5.7 Billion Yuan Have Been Approved; Wuhan Great Iron Bridge Actively Being Planned</h3>

The following important proposals have entered the implementation phase: A) The construction of the Xiang River water conservancy project has been approved by the Water Conservancy Commission with a budget of 5.7 billion yuan.

<h3>Tianjin Social Bureau Secretly Hoarded Grain; Investigation Team Lodges Protest; Demands Apology from Mayor Zhang and Punishment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] The investigation team for takeover work has been here for four days. The investigation work is being actively carried out by various committee members in their assigned units. A rather intriguing event occurred on the 22nd. On the day the team arrived in Tianjin, it received a secret report stating that the Social Bureau had secretly hoarded more than 2,000 jin of grain when organizing winter relief last year, attempting to sell it unsuccessfully. It had all rotted. After receiving the report, the team sent two committee members, Rong Zhao and Huang Yuren, to conduct an investigation. It was confirmed that it was true. The wheat was hidden in the cellar of the Municipal No. 51 Elementary School and had become moldy. After the incident, Hu Menghua, director of the Social Bureau, rushed to persuade various newspapers not to disclose the news to avoid trouble. The next day, all newspapers remained silent. Committee members Rong and Huang were extremely angry when they heard about this. They believed that the Social Bureau used its power to control news and publications to block news. Moreover, the fact that the winter relief wheat was hoarded until autumn clearly showed a suspicion of using official power to seek personal gain, which greatly affected the future work of the investigation team. They submitted a joint letter to Mayor Zhang of the municipal government, lodging a protest and demanding: (1) an apology to the team; (2) appropriate punishment for the director of the Social Bureau; (3) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] After the takeover work investigation team arrived in Pan, the work was extremely tense. They have been inspecting various factories and warehouses for days. Chief Qian Gonglai attached great importance to some of the moldy materials in the warehouse. According to Qian, the factories and warehouses store a large amount of materials. If they are not processed quickly, they will be damaged, which would be a major loss to the country. He has instructed the persons in charge of various factories and warehouses to sort and categorize them according to their nature and clean them up as soon as possible. Mr. Qian and others are scheduled to go to Fushun, Anshan, Yingkou and other places today for inspection.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of National Defense Inspects Troops Stationed in Zhenjiang and Suzhou</h3>

They first arrived in Zhenjiang on the 20th. After completing their mission, they arrived in Suzhou yesterday afternoon, accompanied by personnel sent by the provincial government. However, Vice Minister Liu was urgently summoned and temporarily returned to Nanjing. The group was led by Director Xu instead. After arriving in Suzhou, they went to the Lexiang Hotel to rest. A reporter from our Suzhou office made a special visit and made some inquiries. It was reported that this inspection was purely to examine the military discipline and living conditions of the troops under their command and to convey the government's message of condolence. There was no other mission. They will return to Nanjing tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Chairman Shen Inspects Dinghai and Holds a Symposium on Revitalizing Fisheries and Agriculture; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders Counties to Simplify Administrative Systems</h3>
<p>[Our Dinghai Dispatch, 24th] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie left Ningbo and crossed the sea to Dinghai County on the 23rd. This county is one of the main islands of the Zhoushan Islands, one of China's three major fishing grounds. The entire county of 400,000 people depends on fisheries for a living. After Mr. Shen arrived, he inspected various streets. He then had lunch by invitation of Yang Daozhao, the commissioner stationed in Dinghai by the Naval Headquarters. Mr. Yang treated Mr. Shen very warmly because Chairman Shen was a veteran of the Navy. This was the first time Mr. Shen had accepted an outside appointment since he began his tour. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies and organizations and held a public security meeting. In the evening, he held a symposium, focusing on issues such as the revitalization of fisheries and agriculture. The spring fishing season in Dinghai was poor, and fishermen had no money to repay their debts, suffering greatly. They only hope that the winter fishing season will be successful to avoid falling into a dangerous situation. After Mr. Shen gave separate instructions, he attended Dinghai's welcome meeting on the morning of the 24th, inspected Shenjiamen, a fishing concentration area, and went to Putuo for inspection.</p>

<h3>Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs Inspects the Zibo Mining Area; All Sectors in Shandong Plead for Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Various sectors in the city telegraphed the central government, earnestly requesting the speedy allocation of 2 billion yuan for emergency relief to help refugees. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang also promised to forward the request to the central government for the allocation of huge funds for relief. Because Liaocheng was besieged for eight months, 20 million yuan was specially allocated, and the Shandong Youth Rehabilitation Branch was requested to allocate another 10 million yuan for joint relief. Refugees in the city requested a loan of 500 million from the central government to run small-scale industrial and commercial loans. 20 million yuan was allocated by the Ministry of Social Affairs as a foundation for schools for orphans. Minister Gu arrived in Zhangdian on the evening of the 23rd and inspected the Zibo mining area on the 24th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and others inspected the No. 1, 2, and 4 temporary middle schools in Jinan at noon on the 22nd, which accommodated homeless and out-of-school youths from various counties. Due to high prices in Jinan, each person's food expenses require 30,000 yuan per month, but each student currently only receives 7,000 yuan in relief funds per month, so they are all underfed. When inspecting the dormitory of the First Temporary Middle School, more than 300 male and female students were squatting under the shade of trees for lunch because there was no dining hall. Eight people formed a group with only twelve corn buns, more than ten pieces of pickled vegetables, and a tile basin of cold water. The Fourth Temporary Middle School was set up in the former Ma Barracks. The horse trough was changed into a washroom. The classrooms leaked rain, and the doors and windows were open. Soil was piled up as benches. More than ten people lived in one bedroom. Mr. Gu gave a speech to the students under broken tiles and crumbling walls, expressing his condolences. The students were moved to tears. More than 500 male and female students listening to the speech had no socks. The male students had broken shoes that exposed their toes, and their faces were thin and yellow. One student said: "I wash my white short jacket every night and wear it the next day. I have no other clothes. Winter is coming, and I don't know how to keep warm." According to the principals of the two temporary middle schools, there are nearly 10,000 displaced students in Jinan. Most of them are underfed. Because there is no funding, they drink cold water and many are sick. They are eagerly awaiting relief from the central government.</p>

<h3>Anping Incident Team Yesterday Went to Da Xiao Sha River</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The 25th Special Team of the Military Mediation Department investigating the Anping Incident, after returning to Beiping from Xianghe yesterday, held another meeting on the morning of the 24th, deciding to go to Anping's Da Xiao Sha River to conduct an on-site investigation. They departed at 1:30 PM, expecting to return to Beiping the same day, but had not returned as of 9:00 PM. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The 25th Team returned to Beiping from Xianghe at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 23rd. They may go to the scene of the Anping incident again on the afternoon of the 24th to investigate. This round trip of the team, staying in Xianghe for three days, further proves that the National Army did not participate in the American army's ranks, nor did they pass through the Pingjin Highway to fight against the Communist army. During the interrogation on the 22nd, the Communist army provided four witnesses, namely Wang Zhichao, a commander from the 14th Military Sub-district of Eastern Hebei, Li Qingchun, the company commander of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 50th regiment, Wang Entao, a squad leader of the Tongxian Brigade, and Ma Deming, a sentry of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 53rd regiment. Wang Zhichao, the commander of the Communist army who participated in the conflict, strongly asserted that the American and National armies jointly attacked, and that two of his soldiers charged to the front of a jeep, and when seizing an enemy's rifle, the opponent pleaded in Chinese, "If you take my gun, I won't be able to live." This was used to prove that the National Army and the American army were fighting shoulder to shoulder. However, his description of the soldier who spoke Chinese was inconsistent, once saying he was in the car and once saying he was on the ground. The rifle they claimed to have seized as a Zhongzheng type rifle, after inspection by the team, turned out to be an old Mauser broken rifle. Therefore, the claim that the National Army participated in the battle has been disproved. Whether this matter was a Communist army conspiracy or not has not yet been fully determined. What is known is that two weeks before the incident in Anping, a platoon from the Tongyu Brigade of the Communist army was transferred there. As for the platoon of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 53rd regiment that was later transferred, according to a report from a senior Communist officer, they were transferred to that location on the 24th. However, according to the sentry of that company, Ma Deming, they had not yet been stationed in the Anping area on the 28th. The Communist army's strength was temporarily reinforced. As for how the Communist army was mobilized, it is currently not very clear. However, the closest distance between the Communist army's outpost and the American army was thirty yards. Americans and Chinese differ in figure, skin color, and features, making it easy for the Communist army to identify them. As for whether the area is a "Liberated Zone," according to the combined testimonies of the Communist witnesses, the Communist army was not regularly stationed in that area before the Anping incident. The area seems to be a mixed area of the National and Communist armies. The team arrived in Xianghe at 3:00 PM on the 21st after passing through difficult muddy roads and crossing the Beiyun River, which marks the boundary between the two armies. Zeng Yongya, the commander and brigade commander of the 14th Military Sub-district of the Communist army, hosted a banquet that evening to express his appreciation and held a simple welcome party. The next day, they interrogated the four witnesses provided by the Communist army. That evening, a variety show was held to entertain the guests. That day, from afternoon to late at night, artillery fire intermittently came from the suburbs, and the window glass rattled. However, the team members continued to work. This morning, after interrogating three civilian witnesses provided by the Communist side, they will return to Beiping. The 27th team's subgroup responsible for mediating the conflict in the Xianghe area arrived in Xianghe in the afternoon when the 25th team left Xianghe.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou News Reporters</h3>
<p>Do Not Attend Mayor's Reception</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 23rd] Guangzhou City's news reporters have begun a boycott movement against Mayor Ouyang Ju. The mayor does not provide the press with any convenience. Except for holding regular meetings, receiving reporters, and issuing written statements, it is usually difficult to get close to him. This afternoon, the boycott movement began. The mayor had originally scheduled to receive reporters at noon, but no reporters attended at the appointed time. Hot tea and exquisite cakes were placed on the conference table, but no one appreciated them. A reporter said: "When we interview municipal officials, we are often met with closed doors. Now, even if there are delicious refreshments, we are not willing to accept them."</p>
<h3>Hangzhou City Reporters Demand the Impeachment of Speaker Luo Yun</h3>
<p>Accuse Him of Speaking Up for Wang Wuquan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] The Hangzhou City Council, because its Speaker Luo Yun spoke up for the traitor Wang Wuquan, held a reception for reporters today to express the council's attitude, stating that it has always upheld the principles of justice and frankness. Luo's words and actions were inappropriate and cannot represent the council's opinions. During the meeting, Hangzhou reporters added questions, demanding the impeachment of Luo Yun, and requested Zhu Qizhi, the defense lawyer for the traitor Wang, to donate the litigation fee of 3.2 million yuan to the poor people in his district to clear his suspicion. It was previously reported that the Hangzhou Provisional Council applied to restore dance halls. It is now known that the council did not formally apply before canceling them.</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Places, Rugao's Order Gradually Stabilizes, Lack of Food in the City</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong Correspondence] Xu Mojia, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, inspected Rugao again on the 15th of this month after its recovery and returned to Nantong on the 18th. According to him: the order in the Rugao area is gradually stabilizing, and the government agencies are working quite intensely. There is a lack of rice in the city, and civil servants eat flour. The market is showing signs of improvement, but the Tong-Ru highway is still being damaged by the Communist army from time to time. When Commissioner Xu arrived in Rugao, Chairman Wang Maogong also flew to Rugao to inspect, but because the airport was damaged by the Communist army, he could not land and returned to Zhenjiang.</p>

<p>Luoyang Town Chief Shot and Killed by Bandits, Shen Guangshu, the town chief of Luoyang Town in the Sixth District of Dongxiang, this county, was over fifty years old. He was honest, sincere, and courageous in undertaking tasks. On the 21st at dusk, at his residence in Shenjiatou, a little over a mile away from the town, while he was having supper, three bandits dressed in plain clothes who spoke with local accents suddenly broke in, falsely claiming: "We are from the Luoyang Security Team. Which one is Town Chief Shen?" Shen stood up and replied that he was, and invited them to sit down. At that moment, another bandit suddenly drew a pistol and shot Shen in the head, firing three shots in succession. Town Chief Shen immediately fell to the ground and died. The bandits also hesitated and fled. The county government, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the district authorities to strictly apprehend the murderers.</p>
<p>Changshu Pleads for Relief to Industry and Commerce with the Ministry</p>
<p>The county chamber of commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan, stating that industry and commerce here are suffering from the impact of foreign goods dumping and the pressure of rising costs. Also, because the establishment of silver and money houses is not widespread, funds are out of balance, and they are subject to high-interest loans, resulting in an imminent overall collapse. They requested that the Changshu branches of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank be designated to allocate 10 billion yuan in industrial and commercial loans for relief.</p>
<p>Declare Martial Law Lifted and Restore Normalcy This city defense headquarters, in order to cope with special circumstances and ensure the security of the city, has imposed martial law since the 14th of this month. Under the joint preparation of various military agencies and teams, Anning has been the same as usual for days. County Magistrate Pan, in view of this, issued an order to declare the lifting of martial law and restore all temporary measures to normal.</p>
<p>Fengxian This Year's Land Tax to Be Converted to National Currency</p>
<p>The land tax of Jiangsu Province this year was originally set at four dou and nine sheng of grain per yuan of tax. Although the provincial government later submitted to the central government and was approved to reduce the original amount by 40%, calculating to one dou and nine sheng and six he of grain, this county has always relied on cotton as its main agricultural product, and rice and grain must rely on supply from neighboring counties. Therefore, the county authorities submitted to the provincial government for approval to convert the levy to ginned cotton. It is now learned that the county's provisional council, in order to reduce procedures, avoid malpractices, and reduce the burden on the people, has again requested the provincial government to convert it into the national currency. The province has been invited to approve it, and the county is currently telegraphing the province for instructions on the conversion method.</p>
<p>Haining The Boundary Between Ning and Tong Counties to Be Re-Surveyed</p>
<p>This county is connected to Tongxiang County, and disputes arise from time to time due to unclear demarcation. In 1928, the provincial government approved the permanent county boundary, but after the victory, it became unclear again, and misunderstandings arose from time to time. Land registration needs to be promoted urgently. Now, the land registration office of this county has written to the Tongxiang authorities to follow the past methods to carry out surveying work to facilitate the promotion of government orders.</p>
<p>Hangzhou The Completion of the Hang-Chun Highway is Extended</p>
<p>The highway between Hangzhou and Chun'an and the highway between Lanxi and Shouchang were previously approved by the Provincial Department of Communications for the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications to allocate funds for construction. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, but due to insufficient time, it will be extended to September 15 to complete the traffic. The Yuhang-Lin'an section of the Hangmei Highway will also be completed at the same time.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Contribution of the Chinese Delegation to the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has almost reached its "one-month" anniversary since its inception. However, in these twenty-odd days, we have only heard the grand pronouncements of the representatives of the twenty-one nations, as well as the opinions of the representatives of Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria on the peace treaty. The slow progress of the conference is almost unimaginable. In recent days, various committees have been meeting, but there has been no significant progress. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in mid-September. If the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria cannot be completed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, then these two equally important international conferences will be difficult to hold simultaneously in Paris and New York. Either the peace conference will be temporarily adjourned, or the United Nations General Assembly will be postponed. Therefore, at this time, it is necessary for the peace conference to expedite its work.</p>
<p>Although the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference has rarely spoken or wanted to make many proposals because these five peace treaties have no direct interest relationship with China, seeing the complexity and divergence of opinions among various countries, and the amendments to the draft treaties proposed by the representatives of various countries piling up like mountains, if they are all to be put forward for discussion, it will not only waste time, but also the representatives of various countries will debate until they are hoarse. Wang Shijie, the head of our delegation, together with the representatives of Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, and other countries, proposed an amendment to the preamble of the draft peace treaty with Italy, advocating that the preamble should praise the merits of the Italian democratic elements in resisting the fascist regime, which was well received by the representatives of all countries attending the peace conference. The Chinese delegation also issued a statement in Paris stating: "Although the Paris Peace Conference is not directly related to China's national interests, the Chinese delegation expresses great concern for the work of the peace conference. This delegation will strive to contribute to the fair resolution of all major issues. The negotiations of the Paris Peace Conference and the spirit it embraces will become a precedent for another conference, and the fate of Japan will be decided in that other conference."</p>
<p>The Peace Conference's Political and Territorial Committee met the day before yesterday and put forward the Chinese amendment for discussion. The original text of the amendment read: "After the Allied forces, with the assistance of the democratic elements of the Italian people, achieved victory, the Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, and Italy surrendered unconditionally and signed armistice agreements on September 3 and 29 of the same year..." While the original text of the draft peace treaty with Italy read: "The Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, under military pressure, and Italy immediately surrendered unconditionally and accepted the armistice agreements signed on September 3 and 29 of the same year..." The Chinese representative also stood up and spoke, explaining that the purpose of the Chinese delegation in proposing this amendment was to praise the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime. After he finished speaking, he immediately received the endorsement of the United States and France and was unanimously passed by the committee.</p>
<p>This Paris Peace Conference, whether it was the plenary session or the meetings of various committees, had never passed a Chinese amendment as smoothly as it did that day. As far as the Chinese delegation is concerned, this is indeed a great success for them in participating in the peace conference. Before Foreign Minister Wang set off for Paris, he issued a statement explaining China's attitude towards the peace conference: (1) The purpose of this trip is to promote the success of the peace conference; (2) China must support all proposals that can strengthen the foundation of world permanent peace. In other words, international justice is the main foundation of world permanent peace; (3) All territorial disputes should be resolved with nationalism as the highest principle; (4) The peace given by the United Nations to its enemy countries must avoid all unnecessary and dangerous conditions. Foreign Minister Wang also spoke about this when he made his first speech at the peace conference? He also publicly declared that Italy's contributions in the late stage of the war should be reasonably recognized. This time, the proposal of the amendment and its unanimous passage by the committee can also be said to be Wang's success, implementing his proposition.</p>
<p>Because of geographical obstacles, China did not directly participate in the battles in the European theater in this war, but China was a pioneer in the fight against aggression, first raising the banner of anti-fascism, and containing millions of Japanese troops, trapping them in the quagmire of China, making it impossible for them to participate in the European war and assist Germany in the war. Therefore, China can at least be said to have indirectly participated in the European countries. During the Potsdam Conference, the three giants also declared that the peace treaty should be drafted by the foreign ministers' conference organized by the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China. However, China has no direct interest relationship with the peace treaty, so it has never intervened in the drafting of the peace treaty. This time, our country's representatives proposed the amendment, not because they had a special fondness for Italy, nor because our country had other intentions, but purely out of the motivation to promote the success of the peace conference. Australian representative Beasley congratulated our country's representatives, saying: "It is fortunate that the content of the treaty will not be bound by the draft prepared by the four foreign ministers' conference." This sentence has profound meaning and is worth pondering by the representatives of all countries.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future of the peace conference, because the interests of the representatives of various countries are inconsistent, there are many difficulties, and most of them are problems that are not easy to solve and need to be considered for a long time. Therefore, at present, it is difficult to expect the Paris Peace Conference to make rapid progress in the shortest possible time. Our country's delegation in Paris should still adhere to its original intention, continue to work hard, see clearly the cracks in the contradictions between countries, and make repairs to leaks at any time, propose amendments that conform to international justice, so as to contribute to the success of the peace conference. This will not only help to clarify European politics, but also have a great relationship with the future development of the Far East situation. If the Paris Peace Conference unfortunately fails, the impact will be such that the Far East Peace Conference will be far away, and the peace treaty with Japan will not be smoothly produced.</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia is Blustering, US Secretary of the Army Patterson Roars, Saying US Troops Should Deploy and Fight at Any Time, Ready to "Have a Go," US Secretary of the Army Patterson</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] The US ultimatum to Yugoslavia expired on the 24th. The Yugoslav government officially broadcast in Belgrade on the 23rd, stating that Marshal Tito had decided to refuse to reply to the US ultimatum, believing that the ultimatum was unnecessary because the US airmen forced down in Yugoslav territory had already been released on the 22nd. In fact, this attitude of Yugoslavia is nothing more than strong on the outside but weak on the inside. According to an analysis by Agence France-Presse, although Marshal Tito has expressed his refusal to reply to the ultimatum, in fact Yugoslavia has complied with its demands: First, all the pilots and passengers of the US aircraft forced down on the 9th of this month have been released and allowed to return to the border; Second, the US authorities have been granted permission to go to the scene of the incident to inspect the remains of the US aircraft shot down on the 19th of last month; Third, according to a telegram from Patterson, the US ambassador to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav government has agreed to do its utmost to prevent similar incidents from happening again. In addition, it is also learned that Marshal Tito has ordered the pilots of fighter jets to avoid shooting down foreign aircraft flying over Yugoslav airspace. On the other hand, US Secretary of the Army Patterson, in a speech to the American Legion Convention in Boston on the 23rd, expressed extreme indignation at the shooting down of US aircraft by Yugoslavia. He said that Yugoslavia is our ally, and its current position is mostly due to our country's continuous supply, but this ally now deliberately shoots down our aircraft and unreasonably defends itself, which cannot but make every American feel indignant. He also said that the United States must have a well-trained army, ready to be ordered to go to war at any time.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of the Second US Aircraft is the Crux of the Problem</h3>
<p>What the United States demands in its final ultimatum includes two items: one is the release of all personnel on board the US aircraft forced down on the 9th of this month, and the other is to have US personnel make contact with the personnel who were not killed in the crash of the second US aircraft shot down, and release them immediately. The first matter has now been completely resolved, and what remains is only the second matter. Acting US Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference in Washington on the 23rd that the United States is not satisfied with this matter and must wait for the exact news of the whereabouts of the personnel of the second US aircraft before it can consider the final opinion. As to whether the United States will still submit this case to the United Nations Security Council, Acheson did not make a clear statement, only asking reporters to pay attention to the content of the US note, saying that the United States will determine its subsequent steps based on the evidence and Yugoslavia's actions to correct its errors. It can be seen that the crux of the current problem is only in the whereabouts of the second US aircraft that was shot down.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Launches Counterattack, Diplomatic War Intensifies</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The Daily Mail quoted a Paris dispatch as saying: Yugoslavia has decided to submit one hundred and sixty cases of US violations of Yugoslav airspace to the United Nations, which is a countermeasure to the US action. According to Reuters: Yugoslavia will also file a complaint with the United Nations to protest the US detention of Yugoslav ships. This action has clearly made the most serious diplomatic conflict since the war even more complicated. Yugoslavia's accusation against the United States was submitted to UN Secretary-General Lie, requesting that the "unreasonable detention of Yugoslav ships in the Danube River by the US occupying forces" be included in the agenda. According to the Yugoslav representative attending the United Nations, Yugoslavia only asked the Economic and Social Council to discuss the Danube River navigation issue. As far as he knew, the Yugoslav letter to the United Nations did not mention the United States.</p>
<p>British Bomber Squadron Visiting the United States</p>

<h3>Turkey's Reply to the Soviet Union Officially Released</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 24th] Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union's request to revise the status of the Straits has been released by the Anatolian News Agency. It firmly rejects the Soviet Union's proposal for a joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Straits but accepts the convening of an international conference to discuss the principles of revising the Montreux Convention. The reply stated that Turkey believes that the security of every country should be guaranteed by the United Nations' guard forces. If the Soviet Union fears that its Black Sea base will be attacked from the Mediterranean through the Straits, it only needs to rely on the United Nations. Turkey has deep faith in the United Nations.</p>

<h3>Soviet Purge of Diplomatic Personnel, Litvinov Dismissed, Gusev and Malik Succeed as Deputy Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Litvinov</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 24th Broadcast: It is reported that Litvinov has been dismissed from his position as Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister. The Soviet Council of Ministers unanimously approved the selection of Gusev, the Soviet Ambassador to England, and Malik, the former Soviet Ambassador to Japan, as Deputy Foreign Ministers.

<p>It is noted that Litvinov previously served as Soviet Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States. While Foreign Minister, Litvinov negotiated the recognition of the Soviet Union with the late President Roosevelt and the US State Department in Washington in 1933. Litvinov was a supporter of collective security and advocated for close relations with Britain and the United States. He resigned as Foreign Minister before the outbreak of the European war, and was succeeded by Molotov. When German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Litvinov rejoined the Soviet diplomatic corps, arriving in the United States as Soviet Ambassador one day before Pearl Harbor. On August 22, 1943, Gromyko succeeded Litvinov as Soviet Ambassador to the United States, at a time when the Soviet Union was calling for the opening of a second front in the West. (United Press)</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 23rd] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi returned to Rome after attending the peace conference. He may encounter unpleasant emotions during the cabinet meeting on Saturday.

<h3>Regarding the Preamble to the Italian Peace Treaty, Our Amendment Was Passed, Noting the Public Achievements of Italian Democrats</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Regarding the amendment proposed by the Chinese delegation to the draft preamble of the Italian Peace Treaty, which advocated praising the merits of Italian democrats in resisting the fascist regime in the preamble, it was unanimously passed by the Committee on Italian Political and Territorial Affairs on the 22nd. The committee discussed the first paragraph of the preamble, which listed the names of the countries signing the Italian Peace Treaty, and it was unanimously passed by the meeting without discussion. The second paragraph was then discussed, and the Italian representative wanted to amend it, arguing that the responsibility for the war should be distinguished between the Fascist regime and the Italian people, which led to a lengthy debate. Finally, the Dutch representative proposed an amendment, arguing to replace "Italy declared war" with "Italy fought," which was put to a vote and passed by a majority of eleven votes to nine. The third paragraph was then discussed, and the representatives of various countries automatically abandoned their proposed amendments to facilitate the amendment proposed by the Chinese representative. The representatives of Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia unanimously expressed their support. The original text of the Chinese representative's amendment stated, "After the Allied forces were assisted by the democratic elements among the Italian people to achieve victory, the Italian fascist regime was overthrown on July 25, 1943, and Italy surrendered unconditionally, and signed an armistice agreement on September 3rd and 29th of the same year..." while the original text of the draft of the Italian Peace Treaty was "The Italian fascist regime was overthrown under military oppression on July 25, 1942, and Italy surrendered unconditionally, and accepted the armistice agreement signed on September 3rd and 29th of the same year..." The Chinese representative stood up and spoke, explaining that the purpose of this amendment was to praise the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime. The representatives of the United States and France unanimously expressed their support. The Australian representative, Beasley, then stood up and spoke, expressing his congratulations to the Chinese representative, and said that regarding the content of the peace treaty, the peace conference was no longer bound by the draft formulated by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, was deeply surprised to hear this, and said that the Chinese amendment and the original text of the draft peace treaty did not differ significantly. The first paragraph was largely the same, and as for the second paragraph praising the merits of the Italian people in resisting the fascist regime, it has always been supported by the Soviet representatives. The British representative, McNeil, agreed with the Chinese amendment, which was unanimously passed by the committee. At this point, the committee announced the adjournment of the meeting, and will continue to meet next Monday.</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Prepares for Peace Terms Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] According to well-informed sources, the Second Government is actively preparing for future peace terms negotiations, as the belief that the Allied powers do not intend to arrange a peace treaty with Japan is increasing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has convened diplomatic veterans to hold weekly meetings to discuss current diplomatic policies and international relations. Starting next month, the scope of the meeting will be expanded to invite responsible persons from all walks of life in society to participate. Five political leaders, including progressive leader Inukai Ken (but excluding the Communist Party), three professors, several artists, journalists, and other figures, will meet with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to review the evolution of the international situation and exchange opinions on the direction of Japanese diplomatic policy. According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this type of meeting has no direct impact on holding a peace conference, but well-informed sources point out that the official statement is insincere.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Designates 500 Factories, For Japanese Reparations, Ambassador Koo Negotiates with the US on Japanese Reparations Issues</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] According to a special announcement from the Foreign Affairs Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, MacArthur Headquarters today ordered the custody of 505 factories in eight sectors of Japanese industry, which is the second measure in the plan for reparations between Japan and China. The industrial sectors designated this time are machine tools, steel mills, thermal power generation, bearings, soda ash, chlorine and caustic soda, shipbuilding, sulfuric acid, and civilian ordnance factories. The designation this time is based on the reparations targets approved by the Far Eastern Commission and the standards for selecting factories. As for aircraft factories and research institutes, they were already designated as the first measure in the interim reparations plan. Lee Dee, the head of the Industry Department of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, said in a statement on the matter that no country on the United Nations side has actually designated the dismantling of a certain factory at this time, and this matter must be decided in the future. The commander of the Eighth Army was instructed to effectively manage the designated factories, and to allow the factories deemed necessary for the purposes of occupation to continue to operate until a final decision has been made on the dismantling of the specified factories.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 24th] After MacArthur Headquarters designated Japanese factories to be used as reparations for the second time today, the overall scale of the factory equipment to be dismantled has been fully clarified. It is reported that MacArthur Headquarters first ordered the custody of a total of 394 aircraft factories, army and navy factories, and research institutes on January 20 for use as reparations. After slight additions and deletions on May 30, the number became 594. Adding the 505 factories announced today, the total is 1,099 factories. The wartime military factories existing in Japan have been virtually completely included, and their number accounts for one-third of all Japanese factories. These factories will be used to restore the industries of various countries that were destroyed by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The focus of negotiations on the issue of Japanese reparations is not in Tokyo but in Washington, where Ambassador Koo is currently in charge, negotiating with the US State Department. The Allied powers have requested our side to submit a list of losses incurred due to Japanese aggression in order to accurately determine the amount of compensation. It is now known that a portion of this information has been sent, but it will take some time to complete the list. It is heard that the US side has expressed sympathy for our country's request for priority compensation rights. Regarding how to compensate for the losses caused by the Soviet army's removal of industries in the Northeast, the nature of the matter is not simple, and it cannot be discussed at present. Qualified persons believe that the issue of reparations from Japan in the Far East must be resolved at the Far Eastern Peace Conference to be held next year.</p>
<h3>US Submarine Force Conducts Exercises in the Arctic Sea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 23rd United Press] The US submarine fleet conducted a one-month exercise in the Arctic waters between Siberia and Alaska. Five US submarines sailed north from the United States last month to Dutch Harbor, the Pribilof Islands, and St. Lawrence Island, and passed through the Bering Strait to the Arctic Sea, four of which sailed directly to 70 degrees north latitude. McCain, the commander of the US Navy submarine fleet, said that the exercise was "of a training nature" and aimed to familiarize naval officers and sailors with the Arctic Sea environment. This was not for combat, nor was it aimed at any particular country.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Allows Japanese to Whaling in the Southern Ocean, Britain and Norway Protest to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] The State Department recently received a suggestion from the Department of the Army that MacArthur organize a whaling fleet based in Japan, under the supervision of non-Japanese experts, to engage in whaling in the Southern Ocean, and all whale oil be returned to Japan and stored securely. According to the State Department today, Britain and Norway have lodged verbal protests against MacArthur's suggestion.</p>
<h3>The Palestine Issue is Becoming More Complicated and Delicate, Britain's Predicament is Difficult to Advance or Retreat</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Relevant sources here sternly stated that the turmoil in Palestine will delay the demobilization of the military and cost Britain money and lives. This price is extremely unreasonable if it is not used to acquire peace, security, and goodwill. Moreover, the instability of the Palestinian situation is enough to cause Britain to be criticized from all sides. Britain is currently suffering from pressure from the Jewish, Arab, and American sides, so some people feel that it is better for others to come and resolve the Palestinian issue, but this is only a word of anger at the moment.</p>
<p>From a Military Strategic Perspective, Britain Sees it as a Lifeline</p>
<p>For the sake of imperial communication and world security, Britain cannot immediately abandon Palestine. The recent suspension of British-Egyptian negotiations is sufficient to indicate the importance of the Empire's military strategic plans. The decision to withdraw from Egypt has political motivations. British military strategic planners do not show opposition because southern Palestine can serve as a new base in the Middle East. We no longer need to point out how important the imperial lifeline of the Red Sea-Suez Canal-Mediterranean Sea is to Britain, whether in wartime or peacetime. After Britain abandons Egypt, its strongholds in the Eastern Mediterranean are only Greece, Cyprus, and Palestine. The political situation in Greece is unstable, and Cyprus feels too small, so Palestine is an ideal defense center.</p>
<p>Ensuring Friendship with Arab Countries, Key to Middle East Security</p>
<p>On the surface, the Jewish people do not seem to reject Britain's security plan. If Britain can allow the demands of the Jewish people, then the Jewish people are often willing to provide Britain with base facilities, etc., and the Arab people may also be willing to make the same concessions. However, taking Egypt as a lesson from the past, it is feared that at the same time, the Arab people will still inevitably propose the demand for the British to withdraw. British and American public opinion has now forced the British government to pay attention to the voices of the Jewish people, but the Arab people have expressed extreme indignation at the British government's failure to find a way to prevent Jewish immigration, and since Britain's Middle East policy is based in part on the Arab League, it cannot turn a blind eye to this situation. The security of the Middle East depends on whether it can maintain friendship with the Arab world. The Arab League has repeatedly stated that it is determined to support the Arab people of Palestine. Some officials here are also afraid that if Britain ignores their voices, the Arab world may lean towards Moscow. In addition to military issues, Palestine also involves issues such as sea and air traffic and the supply of important materials such as oil.</p>
<p>Seeking Plan Implementation Requires US Assistance</p>
<p>From the perspective of the United States, Britain does not dare to ignore the opinions of the United States, because the Palestine plan must ultimately be approved by the United Nations organization, and it is impossible to pass without the help of the United States. On the one hand, there are six Arab countries in the United Nations, and if Jordan participates again, the number will increase to seven, and they have considerable power in the General Assembly, so the current situation of Britain has fallen into a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Danube River Navigation, United States Clarifies Policy</h3>
<p>[US News Bureau, Washington, 23rd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters when answering questions about the current status of ships on the Danube River that the countries bordering the Danube River are now unwilling to allow their controlled ships to sail out of certain sections of the river. He pointed out that the United States has announced that the United States is willing to discuss the issue of opening up navigation on the Danube River with the countries concerned, so that the countries bordering the river can restore their normal economic life. The Soviet government has detained several ships to Austria and Hungary, the reason for which is that these ships are suspected of being owned by Germany. In the occupied area of ​​Austria, some ships are probably the property of individuals or belong to the governments of countries other than Austria. Acheson said that the ship problem is only part of the overall navigation problem on the Danube River. The United States has repeatedly tried to discuss this matter. He has received reports that the United Nations Secretariat has received a letter from the government of Yugoslavia requesting a discussion of the ship problem in the Economic and Social Council, but he has not seen the letter.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passes New Constitution</h3>

<h3>Establishment of the Greater Shanghai Urban Planning Committee, The planning period is based on the needs of 50 years as a preparation, and seven groups of committees such as land, transportation, and zoning are estimated.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Shanghai Municipal Urban Planning Committee held its inaugural meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, and convened its first meeting. Attendees included兼Chairman Wu Guozhen, ex officio committee members Zhao Kang, Zhu Ping, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Wei, Gu Chunfan, Wu Kaixian (Li Jianhua acting), Gu Yuxiu (Li Ximou acting), appointed committee members Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, Li Qinglin, Shi Konghuai, Xue Cixin, Lu Yishou, Fan Wenzhao, Mei Yilin, Lu Shusen, Xu Guomao, Qian Naixin, Wang Zhixin and other more than 30 people, and Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan attended.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech Expressing Hope that Superficial and Practical Work Proceed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>First, Chairman Wu Guo briefly stated: The Urban Planning Committee was originally stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, and each province and city should establish one. Therefore, I am extremely pleased that the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee is announced today. In the past, Shanghai has never had a complete, large-scale urban plan. What existed was only for the central urban area. Although the former British and French Concessions cannot deny that they achieved considerable results, all facilities were unplanned. In order to establish standards for future urban construction and the guidelines for current administration, a general outline must be established, such as dividing the entire city into commercial areas, residential areas, dock areas, etc., which should be planned in advance and then gradually realized. Therefore, the Urban Planning Committee must simultaneously advance superficial work and practical work. Today, all those present are experts, and I believe that they will make great contributions to the future urban plan of Greater Shanghai. I would like to express my greatest welcome. Subsequently, Zhao Zukang read a telegram sent to the conference by Ha Xiongwen, Director of the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, on behalf of Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, which mainly wished the Urban Planning Committee success.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Speaker of the Council Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech: Briefly stating that the session of the Municipal Council is approaching, and opinions on municipal construction are being actively collected. Therefore, the establishment of the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee is extremely gratifying. Regarding all urban construction, it is unreasonable to only consider the present without looking to the future. Broadly speaking, the construction of the country is also the same. When the Founding Father drafted the Outline of National Reconstruction, it could be said that it was too focused on ideals given the environment at the time. However, now it seems to be the most valuable concrete plan to study. The Shanghai Urban Plan is not just a three-year or five-year plan, but should be a thirty-year or fifty-year plan. Before the war, Shanghai was divided into several spheres of influence, but today it is unified. Therefore, I deeply hope that the Shanghai Urban Planning Committee can formulate a good plan and then gradually promote its realization in stages. The popular will mechanism hopes that today's meeting is the beginning of urban planning, and wishes it success.</p>

<h3>The Investigation of the Korean's Military Supplies to the Enemy Case is in its Final Stage; Sun Tianchang Has No Escape from Guilt; No Corruption Found in the Fourth Hospital</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The case of Sun Tianchang planting military supplies to the enemy. Has been actively investigated by the Liquidation Group for several days. Sun himself has also been interrogated five times by Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the committee. Secret informants and Sun have both provided evidence. Therefore, the development of the case has reached its final stage. Yesterday afternoon, three members of the Liquidation Group, Zhang Qingji, Fan Zhengbo, and Wu Wangji, re-examined Sun Tianchang's warehouse on Seymour Road and the Mou Deli Piano Factory that Sun had seized during the enemy-puppet period. According to Member Zhang, the establishment of the case is beyond doubt. Although Sun tried to quibble about his dealings with the enemy chiefs and building military supplies and aircraft for the enemy, he could not escape in front of Member Zhang, who has a research background in criminal law. Therefore, during the five interrogations, Sun could not deny it. According to Member Wu Wangji, Sun's counter-evidence is numerous and precise. He is indeed a scientist. Even the invoices for purchases twenty years ago are still preserved. The Liquidation Group is now ordering him to submit invoices and business books for the purchase of various machines for investigation. As for the Municipal Fourth Hospital, the Liquidation Group's clerk Zhang Quan, together with Cao Xun, a technician from the Health Bureau, and Peng Yunkun, the chief of the section, jointly investigated the situation yesterday and did not find any corruption. Therefore, the reported case is considered to be untenable. It is also learned that the Liquidation Group is still accepting secret reported cases. The group plans to work in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wuxing, and other places. However, the 50-day time limit is too short. According to Zhang Qingzhi, a member of the group, it is inevitable that the period will be extended.</p>

<p>(Our Report) The case of Major Hawke, a pilot of the former Fourteenth Air Force, who was killed by the Japanese army in an accident in Hong Kong, has neared the end of the trial after several days of continuous trial by the U.S. military court.

<h3>Wan Molin's Family Requests Bail; The Garrison Headquarters is Considering It</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Yesterday, a person in charge of the Garrison Headquarters told reporters: It is rumored that Wan Molin once fainted in prison, which is true. Because Wan was engaged in underground work during the enemy-puppet period, he was tortured and watered by the Japanese, and his intestines were severely injured. Now the wound is festering again.

In addition, staff members of academic research societies in this city can also obtain a distribution certificate by submitting a letter.</p>

<h3>The Gardener's Case of Shooting a Worker Transferred to the District Court; Trial Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Our Report) In March of this year, when a labor dispute occurred in the Shui Mu Company, the workers of the company had a clash with the security guards due to a misunderstanding. Two workers, Zhang Chunsheng and Zhu Jinfu, were shot and killed on the spot.

After a trial by the military court, Ding Wensheng was sentenced to one year in prison, and Wan Guozhang and He Senkun were acquitted. The judgment was immediately submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for review. The Commission considered that the members of the security guards were not active soldiers and should be tried by ordinary judicial organs, and the original judgment was invalid. The Garrison Headquarters then transferred the three to the local court. After investigation, the court filed a public prosecution against them on suspicion of murder. The case was opened in the district court yesterday morning. All three defendants claimed that they acted in self-defense and did not intentionally commit murder.

<h3>Shen Fenggang's Crimes are Evident; He Completely Denies His Previous Confessions During the Trial</h3>
<p>(Our News) Shen Fenggang, a former senior cadre of the puppet government's special services, 35 years old, from Funing, was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The High Procuratorate's indictment stated: In the 28th year of the Republic, the defendant was led by Li Chuchen to carry out secret work in Shanghai. Later, the defendant was arrested by the enemy and immediately defected to the puppet government. On August 9 of the same year, Li Chuchen invited the defendant to Room 302 of the Cathay Hotel to secretly discuss the assassination of Li Shiqun. The defendant was responsible for the insider, but Shen reported this information to Li, and Li arrested Li Chuchen and others, resulting in their death. In addition, he successively killed Su Shaotao, an action member of the Central Party Headquarters in Shanghai, and Yu Yanzhi of the Military Command Bureau, and others, and was promoted to the director of the Third Division of the Puppet Special Services Headquarters and the captain of the First Special Detachment. When Li Shiqun launched the Jiangsu Qingxiang affairs, the defendant served as the Qingxiang Inspection Director. In March of the 31st year, he secretly reported Jiang Yaowen, Chen Hongxun, Chen Rongchang, Yao Guisheng, Xue Heshang, Yang Ming, Zhang Wenyuan, Qian Dadi, and Jiang Yaozhong, who participated in the work of the Shanghai West Administrative Promotion Committee, to the enemy's Hunan Party Soldier Team in Shanghai. After being tortured, they bribed the defendant with huge sums of money to be released. In October of the same year, Xiong Guisong, the captain of the Zhongjiu Army, was also arrested by the enemy's Bédan Road Gendarmerie and bribed the defendant with 230,000 yuan in puppet currency to be released. Zhang Xiongliang, the Shanghai head of the Youth League's Shanghai branch, was also shot and killed by him. Last night, Shen was wearing a light gray palace-style long shirt, white pants, and black shoes, carrying a black folding fan, standing in the defendant's column, eloquently defending himself, denying all the crimes of harming underground workers and others that the indictment accused him of. As for his own confession to the Military Command Bureau, he completely overturned it in court yesterday, claiming that it was a forced confession and could not be admitted. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer also presented many documents proving his position in the central military organs. The court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.</p>

<p>In addition, Jiang Weicheng (also known as Jiang Zhen) was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor.</p>
<h3>The Active Nightingales of Night Shanghai Can Be Seen as an Example of Lamenting Geese</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Every night, under the red and green neon lights, how many girls who have suffered all kinds of abuses are wandering in front of Shanghai's towering buildings, trying to exchange their already decadent souls for a little meager living expenses! They are subjected to contempt, they force smiles, but each of them is performing the tragedy that is being staged every day in this great Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in front of the Shui An Company, two women, Chen Hanzhu and Li Miaoying, were arrested for indecency.</p>
<p>"Let's look at them as an example of lamenting geese." What are the records in the police station? A most strange fact: there are 763 brothels, but only 646 prostitutes!</p>
<p>In order to rectify public morals, the authorities shut down 29 massage parlors and 108 escort agencies. The "female employees" in the massage parlors, 433 people, and the "members" in the escort agencies, 2,500 people, have since disappeared!</p>
<p>As of the 23rd of this month, 2,354 dance girls have been registered.</p>
<p>But how many more are the "nightingales" who are active in Shanghai's sex market than these? Therefore, the likes of Chen Hanzhu and Li Miaoying are constantly dodging and flashing in the neon lights, and scene after scene of tragedy has to unfold every day.</p>
<h3>American Overseas Chinese Swindle and Impersonate Investigators</h3>
<p>U.S. Military Hopes for Reports from All Sectors</p>

<h3>Coveting the Wealth of Neighbors, Sending a Letter of Blackmail Fails</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Du Changsen, the owner of the Xinzhongguo Machine Wood Core Company at 22 Weinan Road, Yangshupu Road, suddenly received a threatening letter on the 19th.

Send it to the entrance of the North Railway Station Post Office from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on the 1st of this month. I will send someone to pick it up with a red letter as proof. Don't say anything. If you don't pay, I guarantee that if a child in your family at No. 22 or No. 24 is missing, it will only cost 10 million yuan. Let your family send someone around 20 years old to send the money. It's up to you whether you send it or not," and so on. Du reported this to the Yangshupu Branch, which sent police to wait at the agreed place on that day, but no one arrived. The next day, he received another express letter, changing the appointment to 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on the 24th, calling the original person to send it to the North Railway Station Post Office, and said that a fiery red paper receipt would be used as proof. At 7 a.m. yesterday morning, the director of the Changyou Police Branch, Wang Xinheng, personally led the criminal section chief Xu Shibin, section member Zhang Yunsheng, inspector Wang Daoxuan, police chief Yin Shucheng, plainclothes police Li Zunzhi, Xie Ruquan, Zhang Shixing, and others, disguised as rickshaw pullers and hawkers, etc., and ambushed at the place. On one side, Du Changsen ordered his cousin Shi Shaoxi to hold a large paper package, pretending to be a large amount of legal currency, and stood at the designated destination. At about 8:10, a person came and waved to Shi, asking if the Du family from Weinan Road, Yangshupu Road, had sent him. He answered yes, and handed him the paper package. Before he had taken a few steps, he was arrested by the police. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed that his name was Chu Zude, 17 years old. He had studied at Changshu Middle School in his hometown and came to Shanghai last year. After being unemployed in June, he temporarily resided at his friend Wu Fufa's place (24 Weinan Road). He saw that the Du family at No. 22 was rich and took this course of action because he was poor. It was all done by one person. The branch decided to send him to the local court tomorrow for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>The Police Bureau's Statement on Foreign Residents' Residence Permits</h3>
<p>(Our Report) In order to answer the comments published in the North China Daily News on August 18 regarding the issuance of foreign residents' residence permits in this city, the Police Bureau issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the purpose of issuing foreign residents' residence permits in this city is to closely protect foreign nationals of various countries residing in this city. The municipal government has long formulated measures and announced their implementation. However, due to the fact that a small number of foreign nationals have not fully understood the procedures, there have been delays, but the general situation is still good. As for the points mentioned in the comments of the North China Daily News, many are not in accordance with the facts, and the language is sarcastic. The author has distorted them. In addition to answering them one by one, the Police Bureau also stated that if foreign nationals in this city have any doubts or opinions regarding our government's laws and regulations, they should directly inquire or make suggestions to the competent authorities, and the government will sincerely answer and adopt them. If they maliciously criticize and confuse the public, they should bear legal responsibility. It is hoped that all foreign nationals can sincerely cooperate with our government.</p>

<h3>Pickpockets Caught and Lost Items Recovered on Election Night for Miss Shanghai; Hong Kong Gang Leader Called to Instigate</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The election night for "Miss Shanghai" at the New Fairy Forest Ballroom was not only a sensation in Shanghai, but also far-reaching in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The city's pickpocket kings Shen Jinbao (nicknamed Xia Ke Xiao Shan) and Guang Yu (nicknamed Li Tou Guang Yu) received a call from the leader of another tightly organized gang in Hong Kong to instruct them to be active. So they dressed in suits and shoes, looking like young masters, bought tickets to enter the venue, and took the opportunity to "show off their skills." However, they were discovered by the undercover police officers densely deployed inside the venue and were arrested on the spot. Shares of stock of Qin Yu Stockings and Shirt Factory 25460-25461, Xinhe Yarn Factory 53462, and China Underwear Company 001646-001483, as well as a gold watch and a stainless steel watch, were seized. Witnesses were detained in the Shanghai Police Headquarters. It is hoped that the owners of the above items will go to the Detective Class of the Headquarters to claim them.</p>
<h3>Overwhelmed with Emotion Recalling a Visit to the Yat Sen Warship</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Yat Sen warship has returned. On the 20th, the Japanese, acting on orders from General MacArthur's headquarters, sent it back to its homeland from the Wu Military Port. It is now berthed on the river surface at the Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<p>The "Yat Sen" was a light cruiser of the First Fleet of our Navy, a product of the Jiangnan Shipyard itself in the 16th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1927]. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, it was assigned to the Jiangyin Fortress. Later, the Yat Sen was eventually sunk in the Yangtze River near Jiangyin.</p>
<p>After the National Army shifted its positions westward, the Japanese army salvaged the Yat Sen from the bottom of the Yangtze River and took it to Japan. Yesterday, when this reporter visited in a five-foot-long sampan and saw the Yat Sen again on the river, I couldn't help but feel a mix of memories and emotions.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the river, the Yat Sen has changed beyond recognition. The newly applied light iron-gray paint cannot hide the scars all over the ship's sides. In particular, a cabin has been added to the stern, sticking out like an unsightly wart.</p>
<p>As the sampan pulled alongside the ship, Deputy Captain An Guoxiang welcomed us into the reception room, and then accompanied us on a tour. Thus, I gained an initial impression of the interior of the ship: compact. Small, yes, everywhere feels cramped. However, you feel it is extremely compact, simple, and unadorned. The entire ship is 271 feet long, 34 feet wide, with a draft of 12 feet, and weighs 1500 tons. Of course, it cannot compare to the tall and large American ships, but it is a warship built by our country, the beginning of the new navy, and also an old soldier who has endured hardships. Although small, it is our honor, our pride.</p>
<p>Deputy Captain Mi is an enthusiastic and hardworking young man from Hunan. According to what he told this reporter during the tour, there was originally a six-inch caliber gun at the bow and a five-and-a-half-inch one at the stern. When the American army occupied Japan, they disarmed the ships and sank them all into the Pacific Ocean. After the Japanese navy took the "Yat Sen," they converted it into a training ship and added a cabin to the stern for use as a classroom, which is the wart we saw earlier.</p>
<p>We climbed up layer by layer from the so-called "uppermost deck" at the front of the ship to the top layer. There are a total of four layers. In order, they are: (1) the communications room and navigation rest area, (2) the control room (i.e., the usual bridge), (3) the open-air top layer, where a rangefinder is placed. The bridge is semi-enclosed, and the equipment is extremely simple. The compass is just an ordinary type with magnetic deviation, not a gyrocompass. From top to bottom, the various instruments are equipped with one characteristic: they are all Japanese-made, and the confidential mechanical devices have all been removed before being returned.</p>
<p>We met Captain Ren Guanghai, who had just finished his duties, on the top layer. Captain Ren is from Fujian. He has been in the navy since the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 and is a veteran. After a brief greeting, we took a photo. According to Captain Ren, the whole ship originally needed 160 sailors and 23 officers to cope adequately. Now, due to a lack of personnel, there are only about a hundred people in total, so everyone is a little busier, and the work is quite intense.</p>
<p>The Yat Sen warship seems to be a prototype of China's new navy. It is small and cramped, which is undeniable. However, as long as we can maintain this spirit of tension and hard work, I think perhaps these shallow-draft, small-tonnage warships will be the dawn of the defenders of China's 5,000-mile coastline. (The front picture is the full view of the Yat Sen, taken by this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the Fourth Term of Police Cadets: Mayor's Admonition Expects Two Points - Pay Attention to Improving Traffic and Be Responsible for Banning Street Vendors</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The graduation ceremony of the fourth term of police cadets from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Police Training School was held at the Pingliang Road parade ground at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu and Police Chief Xuan personally attended to deliver admonitions. The graduation ceremony began at approximately 8:00 a.m. When Mayor Wu led the senior officers of the Police Bureau onto the main parade ground, the head of the Police Cadet Corps, Pan Jing, stepped forward to report the number of graduates: 300 male students and 60 female students, as well as 96 teachers and staff members of the Training School. Subsequently, Mayor Wu inspected the police cadets for a week and then ascended the rostrum. At this time, the band played in unison, and the police cadets marched in formation around the parade ground before forming a dense formation in front of the rostrum to await instructions. The chairman of the graduation ceremony was Deputy Director Yu Shuping. After the formalities were completed and the report was given, the mayor was invited to deliver his admonition.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's admonition was full of encouragement, briefly stating: The police bear the greatest responsibility for the city, and 80% of the affairs are related to the police. At the same time, the police represent the credibility of the government. Therefore, whether they respect themselves affects the people's belief in the government. Mayor Wu also raised the most urgent problems in Shanghai to the graduating police cadets: (1) Traffic problems. The mayor himself is often delayed due to traffic congestion in the central district. He hopes that the graduating police cadets can pay attention to this point and study ways to improve it. (2) Banning street vendors. The mayor said: "At first, I thought most of them were refugees, so I couldn't bear to ban this kind of small business. After three months of research, I realized that this is not entirely the case. These street vendors sell foreign goods, canned goods, etc., especially stolen goods from the docks. Allowing them to exist is tantamount to encouraging theft." The mayor also pointed out that after September 1st, except for cigarette and snack vendors, all vendors will be strictly banned, and violators will have their goods confiscated. This kind of enforcement responsibility rests on the shoulders of each police cadet.</p>
<p>Next, Director Xuan delivered a speech, briefly stating: Experience should be given equal weight with knowledge. Today's graduation marks the end of the classroom courses, but it does not mean that police knowledge no longer needs to be learned in the future. Director Xuan loudly appealed and pointed out vigilantly that Shanghai's environment is dirty and filthy, and it is not easy for the bad to become good, but it is easy for the good to become bad. He said, "Here, front, back, left, and right, there is nothing but temptation of pleasure and profit. If the will is not firm, it is easy to be eaten by society. Therefore, we must strengthen our will and transform society, so that Shanghai can shine brightly and become a brand-new city for the revival of China." Then, the representative of the graduating police cadets stepped forward to the rostrum to give a response, expressing sincere acceptance of Mayor Wu's and the senior officers' admonitions and promising to take this as their goal and put it into practice. Finally, the chairman awarded prizes to 18 outstanding students from six classes, including criminal, traffic, etc. The graduation ceremony was thus completed.

<h3>Police Bureau Conducts General Survey of Pet Dogs, Including Training Skills, Reasons for Raising Them, Etc.</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, upholding its spirit of thoroughness, has recently decided to grant pet dogs the special privilege of household registration investigation. All dog lovers must first report their names, genders, ages, native places, occupations, etc., to the authorities in detail. Then, they must indicate the dog's breed, age, the dog owner's reason for raising the dog, whether the dog has been trained, the length of the training period, and the dog's skills, item by item on the form. The most interesting point is that each form has a blank space of one and a half inches long and half an inch wide, specifically for the dog owner to describe the general abilities of their beloved dog. If the dog is as skillfully clever as "Ling Ding Ding," then the owner will not know where to start writing.</p>
<p>As for the "Reason for Raising a Dog" item, it is also of great interest to the people of this city. What is the purpose of raising a dog? An old saying says, "A dog is man's best friend." I wonder what the police bureau will think of this kind of filling method? It is said that the form must be filled out in duplicate, and the fee for obtaining the dog's copper tag is also required to be 1,600 legal tender. The deadline for filling out the form is only seven days. If the dog owner does not pay attention or is stingy with this 1,600 yuan within seven days, then the dog will be excluded from legal society and subject to severe punishment by the police bureau.</p>
<h3>"One World" Award Winner, American Writer, Travels the World - Norman Cousins Visits China and Hosted Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Norman Cousins, a well-known American journalist and publisher who won the first "Wendell Willkie One World Flight" award, recently came to China. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., a press conference was held in the City Hall Auditorium. Cousins is tall and slender, wears glasses, and speaks clearly and powerfully. He contributed greatly to cultural work during the war, especially in broadcasting. Most of the late President Roosevelt's broadcast programs were hosted by him, and his works are often featured on more than 700 radio stations across the United States. Accompanied by Mr. Wei Jingmeng of the International Propaganda Office, he attended the conference and briefly introduced himself before standing up to deliver a speech. He briefly stated that the American people are people with ideals, which is not only evident in the Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights that form the foundation of the country, but also in the Civil War, which was fought for an ideal. The book "One World" by Wendell Willkie is a clear proof of the ideal viewpoints of the American people. Willkie traveled to various countries in 1942, when the international situation was at its worst, and wrote "One World" to report his encounters and experiences to the people. The part about China is particularly moving.</p>

<p>Although Willkie died with regret, his friends decided to continue his legacy and strive to realize his ideals. I personally have traveled to more than 20 countries and recently came to China. I have seen good and bad situations. My conclusion is that the unprecedented central problem in human history is how to achieve unity within countries and between countries, because coordination is very difficult, while division is extremely easy. We must seek a "technique" to achieve the ideal of "One World," and this "technique" must break away from the old ways. I once looked up the meaning of the word "diplomacy" in Webster's dictionary, and its explanation was "to obtain benefits with skill without incurring malice and war." This explanation is definitely no longer applicable today. We should give a new definition of "diplomacy" as "to build a country's reputation with skill." The "technique" we need is like the air conditioning in this room, which reduces the heatwave of international suspicion and disputes. This technique must be found quickly, otherwise it will lead to the misfortune of the world. After Cousins finished speaking, reporters asked questions. He believes that the exchange of international culture and art is very helpful in promoting international cooperation. He expressed deep regret for the recent trend of Chinese music becoming Westernized and hoped that Western music could also be Orientalized. Regarding the existence of American isolationists, he said that this war must have given them a very good lesson. It is reported that Cousins has obtained recordings of opinions on "One World" from British Prime Minister, Polish Prime Minister, Swedish Prince, Egyptian Emperor, Indian Nehru, as well as writers, reporters, and miners from various countries during this trip. He will also collect this information in China and will publicly broadcast his works after they are translated into Chinese. He is scheduled to go to Beijing the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>New No. 11 Textile Factory of China Textile Corporation: Old Workers Incite a Mob to Commit Violence</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The China Textile Corporation's No. 11 Factory on Yichang Road, Shanghai, No. 19 (formerly the Japanese-owned Naigai Cotton Factory No. 4) is currently preparing to resume production. Several days ago, five veteran workers, Sun Minhui, Chen Yunhui, Tang Guoquan, Ma Xinxiang, and Zhang Houkun, gathered more than 300 workers and marched to the factory in a column to demand that production be resumed. After failing to do so, they dispersed. At approximately 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Sun and others gathered more than 100 workers again and went to the factory to take the same action. Factory Director Gong Difan sent personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and learned that among the more than 100 people, only five were veteran workers, and the rest were imposters. Therefore, he strictly refused them and ordered Commissioner Pan Ziping to go out and explain. Who knew that these workers would beat Pan Ziping into injury? At that time, the Putuo Road Sub-bureau reported the incident, and Chief Qi of the sub-bureau personally led a large number of police officers to rush to suppress it and rescue Pan Ziping from danger. The police arrested the perpetrators, Wang Dengjia, Yuan Bingkui, Zhou Denggao, Xu Shouyi, Li Fagen, and Yang Deming, for interrogation. They confessed to the violence. The perpetrators were handed over to the District Procuratorate today for investigation.</p>
<h3>Danish Con Artist Who Sold Jeeps Under False Name Has Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A Dane named Qinsheng, formerly employed by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has now become a vagrant due to unemployment. A few days ago, he falsely claimed to have a large number of Jeeps that would be shipped to Shanghai soon, selling each vehicle for only US$1,200. Three foreigners believed him to be true and successively paid him US$14,300. After Qinsheng obtained the money, he used US$8,500 to buy a Buick car (manufactured in 1942, with eight cylinders). At the time, he paid the car dealer US$6,000 (still owing US$2,500). He drove the car around every day, flaunting it as if he were a wealthy man. After a long time, the three foreigners realized they had been cheated and reported the information to the Municipal Police Bureau. The Foreign Affairs Group of the Criminal Police sent personnel to investigate and arrested Qinsheng in Room 406 of the Cathay Hotel the day before yesterday. They also found US$6,000 in the room, which was taken back to the police bureau together with Qinsheng. It is reported that Qinsheng is actually a big con artist. It is said that the number of Chinese people who have been similarly cheated is also large. They can report to the Criminal Investigation Section of the Police Bureau in Writing Room 402.</p>

<h3>Frontier Education More Developed Than Before the War: Recent Survey of Department-Run Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office] Before the war, although the Ministry of Education had a Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department for frontier education, the position of the director was concurrently held by the director of the General Education Department. The responsibility was not dedicated, and the work was not extensive. During the War of Resistance, a dedicated director was appointed, staff were added, and more strategies were promoted, making it easier to achieve success. After the victory, with the recovery of education, according to recent surveys, Department-run frontier schools at all levels have spread across many provinces. The quantity and quality have increased significantly compared to before the war, with secondary education being largely newly established, and university education also in the budding stage. The exploration and records of Department-run frontier schools at all levels are as follows:</p>
<p>Suiyuan and Rehe Region</p>

<h3>Hualian Fourth Team Wins Table Tennis League Championship</h3>
<p>Youth League Team Protest Rejected</p>
<p>In the first table tennis league, Hualian Youth League played the fourth team final at Jingwu Gymnasium last week. Yang Changxi, the deputy captain of the Youth League, dissatisfied with the referee, made rude remarks on the spot and refused to compete. Afterwards, he submitted a written protest demanding a rematch. The Table Tennis Committee sent Committee Member Hu Jiankun to investigate the truth of the dispute and reported to the authorities. The committee decided on the matter as follows: "If the team believes that there is an error in the referee's decision, it should follow the stipulated procedures to lodge a protest. Today, the Youth League team member resorted to shouting abuse, causing the competition to end prematurely, which is a great loss of sportsmanship. Therefore, the committee ruled that the Youth League team lost the match and warned Mr. Yang Changxi not to repeat such actions in future competitions." Since the Youth League's protest was rejected, the fourth team seed Hualian won the fourth team championship with five wins and no losses. It is heard that the authorities will schedule a final match for all five teams champion soon.</p>

<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>The sixth district, seventeenth precinct, covering Baishan Lane on Tuqing Road and Shude Lane, has experienced a surge in population. It is proposed to add two new *jia* [neighborhood units], designated as the twenty-third and twenty-fourth *jia*, with Zhang Hongchi appointed as the head of the twenty-third *jia* and Zhang Wengui as the head of the twenty-fourth *jia*.</p>
<p>The twenty-first district office (Xanshi Street) in this city, in conjunction with the local police station, held a meeting for *baozhang* [neighborhood chiefs] yesterday, deciding to conduct a random household census from August 21st to 25th.</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A on Ambiguities in Household Registration Laws (Continued)</h3>
<p>(II) Types of Household Registration</p>
<p>(30) Question: Should single employees residing in various government agencies or public factories be registered as one household per person?</p>
<p>Answer: The *hu* [household] in household registration law is equivalent to the *jia* [family, home] in civil law. *Gonggong hu* [public household] is a term used within the *baojia* [neighborhood unit] system and cannot be used to change the criteria for establishing a *hu* in household registration. Therefore, even if people without kinship reside together, they should still establish separate *hu*.</p>
<p>(31) Question: How should the original place of registration ( *benji* ) of a concubine be recorded?</p>
<p>Answer: Since a concubine is a family member of the head of household, her *benji* should naturally be the same as that of the head of household.</p>
<p>(32) Question: Should a contact method be established between various registration books to facilitate investigation when natives, those with registered temporary residence, and migrating populations live together, cook together, and are registered separately?</p>
<p>Answer: Population changes should be registered separately in the relevant books and can be noted in the *baotian hukou ce* [land and household registration booklet] for easy cross-referencing. There is no need to establish a separate contact method.</p>
<p>(33) Question: How should the household registration of military personnel be recorded?</p>
<p>Answer: According to the Ministry's supplementary filling instructions, military personnel should be classified as "public service."</p>
<p>(34) Question: How should *tongyang xifu* [child brides] and nieces intended as brides be recorded?</p>
<p>Answer: They should be registered as family members, with a note in the remarks column stating "fiancée of so-and-so."</p>
<p>(35) Question: If a husband has been at war for more than five years and his wife has children with another man, how should they be registered?</p>
<p>Answer: This should be handled according to Article 1065 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(36) Question: Should household registration book numbers be compiled according to *bao* [neighborhood unit] or *xiangzhen* [township]?</p>
<p>Answer: Compiling by *bao* is smoother.</p>
<p>Question: According to Article 114 of the Household Registration Law, where should the words "concluded" be written?</p>
<p>Answer: It can be written in the margin for easy reference.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Black Market Skyrockets During Textile Conference; Minister Says Textile Company Will Maintain Original Price, Company Says It Will Disregard Public Criticism</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The yarn market soared again yesterday. Buyers were eager to purchase, but available stock on the market was extremely scarce. They were willing to raise prices to secure supplies. Prices for various yarn counts jumped by 100,000 [currency units], yet demand still exceeded supply. It is understood that yesterday's surge was due to yarn mills' insistence on not selling, unwilling to comply with the authorities' intention to sell at the market price before the exchange rate adjustment. They also dared not openly supply the black market. As a result, available stock became even scarcer, and merchants and cloth factories competed to acquire it.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company held its eighth board of directors meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Vice Minister Pan Xulun personally attended and presided over the meeting, which lasted until 7:20 PM. Afterwards, Minister Wang answered questions from reporters from various newspapers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Wang Says No Plan Has Been Finalized</p>
<p>The main task of this Textile Construction Board of Directors meeting was to discuss how to suppress the price of yarn and cloth. After several hours of discussion today, no concrete conclusion has been reached. Further consultation with the Textile Industry Management Committee is needed. The raw cotton used by Textile Construction to produce yarn and cloth is also partly sourced from overseas, so the result of the exchange rate adjustment will undoubtedly affect the production cost of yarn and cloth. However, the Textile Construction authorities are determined to do their best to maintain the original price without raising it.</p>
<p>(II) Regarding the question of how much Textile Construction is allocating, Minister Wang stated that when prices fluctuated slightly, applications for allocation purchases flooded in and the quantities requested increased sharply. Under the circumstances of unlimited demand and limited production, Textile Construction had no choice but to prioritize and allocate rationally based on urgency. There is no intention to reduce the quantity of allocations at a time when yarn and cloth market prices are high. Moreover, yarn and cloth are fundamentally different from grain. The demand for yarn and cloth is quite elastic, so the severity is secondary to the grain issue.</p>
<p>(III) Textile Construction General Manager Shu Yunzhang is currently inspecting the factories affiliated with Textile Construction in Qingdao and Tianjin. According to last month's report, the production quantities of the branch factories in these two regions have increased by 30% compared to before.</p>
<p>(IV) Regarding the export of yarn and cloth, the Ministry has considered two points: (A) It can be used for barter trade with various countries, for example, Vietnam is very interested in bartering rice and coal for our yarn and cloth. (B) Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have a great need for yarn and cloth from the motherland, and this opportunity can be used to establish a market for domestically produced yarn and cloth in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the Ministry is currently considering the entire plan for yarn and cloth exports.</p>
<p>Company Indicates Prices Will Inevitably Rise</p>
<p>According to a report from the United Press, Textile Construction Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing said yesterday: In the past week, more than 200,000 bolts of cloth and more than 20,000 bales of yarn have been released, but the people of the whole country have not benefited in any real way. Only a few people in Shanghai can make undeserved profits without any capital after a warehouse receipt is issued. This phenomenon is truly unreasonable. The government's method of maintaining price limits is tantamount to encouraging speculation. The implementation of any policy requires the joint maintenance of all parties. The current strength of the China Textile Corporation is still small. If other manufacturers do not cooperate and take the same steps, the appetite of the black market is simply impossible to meet. The company has no choice but to disregard public criticism and adjust the distribution price in a flexible manner, taking into account the actual market situation.</p>
<p>Distribution Methods May Be Improved</p>
<p>According to a textile industry source, while the China Textile Corporation's listed prices remain stable, private yarn mills are still selling on the black market. A responsible person is considering unifying the distribution of goods from state-owned and private yarn mills. It is also said that the qualification of trading firms and out-of-town merchants to obtain goods will be re-evaluated. Factories will also review the qualifications for distribution based on their production capacity and manage the selling price of their finished products.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Unleashes Another Frenzy; "Tong Bing" Bonds Shout Out for the 2,000 Mark After Closing; Responsible Authorities Should Respond</h3>
<p>Due to numerous discussions in the newspapers these days about the handling of pre-war debts, causing much speculation, the bond market was stirred up again yesterday. Several large firms in the "Five Flags" and "Seven Floors" districts jointly engaged in activity, and buying interest suddenly intensified. "Tong Bing" bonds opened high in the morning at 1,400 yuan, and after opening, buyers repeatedly competed to purchase, sending prices soaring. The market closed at a purchase price of 1,880 yuan, a sharp increase of 740 yuan compared to the previous close. After the close, prices continued to be bid up to around 2,050 yuan, making for an extremely enthusiastic scene. "Jia" and "Yi" bonds were pushed up from 770 yuan to over 1,000 yuan. "Tong Wu" bonds rose from 1,150 yuan to close at 1,600 yuan, resulting in gains of 40 yuan for "Jia" and "Yi" bonds compared to the previous close, about 500 yuan for "Ding" bonds, and 680 yuan for "Wu" bonds.</p>
<h3>Gold and Currency Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for bare gold was even more sluggish. It opened at 2.17 million, and the high price did not exceed 2.175 million. Many short-term traders, unable to hold their positions, began to close out. Shortly after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank sold 147 bars at a price of 2.155 million. Even at this point, the lowest price did not break 2.155 million. Afterwards, supply and demand balanced, and there were no special changes. At noon, the price struggled around 2.16 million. In the afternoon, it fell slightly below 2.16 million, resulting in a slight decrease of 7,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars remained stable. The interbank lending rate was slightly tight, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 *jiao* [cents].</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were generally stable. U.S. dollars were bought at 3,390 yuan and sold at 3,410 yuan. After opening, the price hovered between 3,380 yuan and 3,400 yuan until noon, which was sluggish. There was still no change in the afternoon, resulting in a slight increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were stable, struggling slightly around 750 yuan, resulting in a slight decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also fixed at 750 yuan to 760 yuan, with continued transactions. Indian rupees were offered at 915 yuan, and British pounds were offered at 12,250 yuan. The U.S. exchange rate was still above the listed price, with designated banks engaging in transactions with each other.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau May Purchase Ping Shui District Export Green Tea at a Reasonable Price</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) Ping Shui green tea in Shaoxing produces a bountiful harvest. Although this year's new goods have already entered the market, due to low selling prices overseas and high domestic costs, transactions have not yet become clear. Tea merchants have repeatedly requested government assistance to reduce losses. It is now reported that the China Trust Bureau plans to purchase at a reasonable price in the near future. If the price of Ping Shui pearl tea is around 2.78 million yuan per *dan* [unit of weight], both tea farmers and tea merchants will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Local export firms are seeing strong buying interest in green teas such as *chou zhen*, *xia mu*, *zhen mei*, and *zhen mei*, which are marketed in the Philippines and Africa, because the selling price of long-shelved old goods is still considered reasonable, and overseas demand is not waning. Taiwan fine black tea is being purchased continuously from Indian firms. Because available stock is low, sellers are pushing the price up even more aggressively. At present, it has soared to 120,000 yuan per *dan*. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, Tianjin merchants are not enthusiastic, but sales from other regions continue to be brisk.</p>
<h3>White Coal Prices Rise Endlessly</h3>
<p>Due to transportation blockages from the Yangquan coal-producing region to Shijiazhuang and Tianjin, and the scarcity of coal in Tianjin, the arrival of goods in Shanghai has been affected. Holders of available stock are treating it as a treasure and are unwilling to easily sell unless they can get a substantial price. As a result, market prices have been rising steadily. Although the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee has ordered a large quantity of Hongji white coal briquettes from Annam [Vietnam], the goods will not arrive in Shanghai for about a month. At that time, market prices will certainly tend to fall back down.</p>
<h3>New Import Restrictions; Customs Has No Knowledge</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) A United Press dispatch from New York on the 22nd of this month stated: "American businessmen today received notification from Chinese customs stating that restrictions on four types of imported goods will become even stricter," etc. This newspaper considered the matter too bizarre and did not publish it. Yesterday, this reporter inquired about this news from a responsible person at the Customs Administration and the Customs Inspectorate General Li Du. It was said that they had no knowledge of this matter. Li also said that there have been no changes recently in customs regulations regarding various imported goods. It is reported that United Press sent another telegram from New York on the 23rd, stating that the news was issued by the "China News Agency" in New York (belonging to the Chinese Propaganda Department) and that the news came from Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Funds Exceed Available Shares; Chinese Stocks Soar Continuously</h3>
<p>Buying interest in Chinese stocks suddenly increased, with Meiya [American-Chinese Company] taking the lead and advancing relentlessly. Various smaller stocks followed closely. Those less popular stocks with solid assets showed promise and continued to be sought after. Due to the limited number of shares, there were more monks than gruel, demand exceeded supply, and prices soared continuously. In the early morning, the low prices of various stocks were: Yongsasha 665 yuan, Meiya 3,930 yuan, Jingfu 243 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Dongxing 170 yuan. Afterwards, the market repeatedly improved, advancing under the leadership of Meiya. By noon, the high prices were: Yongsasha 700 yuan, Meiya 4,280 yuan, Jingfu 263 yuan, Xinguang 278 yuan, and Qinxing 200 yuan. The market stabilized slightly near the close, resulting in a slight increase of 15 yuan for Yongsasha compared to the previous close, a half increase for Meiya, and gains of slightly less than 10% to 15% for Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing. Less popular stocks were each up about 10%, and older stocks soared by 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Foreign stock trading firms were watching, so the situation of the major stocks was stable. Smaller stocks continued to be purchased by Western merchant groups, progressing very quickly. Yisha fell from 9,300 to below 9,000 yuan, while British Union rose from 9,400 to 9,800. The smaller stocks rose sharply from the opening, all showing high prices. The results compared to the previous closing showed that Yisha was flat, British Union rose but had limited gains, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Shanghai Paper, Shanghai Steel, and Shanghai Brewery each rose by about half. Asia rose by slightly less than 10%.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides Autumn Cocoons Will Be Worth Three *shi* of Rice Per *dan*</h3>
<p>To prevent the price of autumn cocoons from being low and affecting the autumn cocoon harvest, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided at its 51st routine meeting to stipulate that the standard price of autumn cocoons should not be lower than the price of three *shi* [unit of volume] of rice per market *dan*, to avoid losses to silkworm farmers and reduce their interest in silkworm breeding. This standard price is based on the calculation of 280 *jin* [unit of weight] of dried cocoons, 440 *jin* of reeled cocoons, and the elimination of double cocoons, thin-skinned cocoons, and other discarded cocoons.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coconut Oil Arrive at Port</h3>
<p>More than 5,000 barrels of coconut oil from Little Luzon [Philippines] have already arrived at the port. It is reported that the quantities arriving in succession will be very large. Coconut oil reached a price of over 300,000 yuan per *dan* in March of this year, but then plunged to 140,000 yuan due to the large quantities arriving in Shanghai. After the foreign exchange adjustment this time, it rose by 40,000 yuan. Now, with a large quantity of coconut oil arriving in Shanghai, prices are likely to fall again.</p>
<h3>Large Batches of Taiwan Sugar Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two Ships with American Cotton and Wheat Also Arrive at Port</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Fulai Shipping Company's *Edvard H.* arrived from McAllen, Texas, loaded with 8,000 tons of wheat, and is currently unloading at the Mitsubishi Wharf. The *Randalph Pickering* arrived from Melville Bay with 6,000 tons of cotton, approximately 13,000 pieces, and is docked at the Gonghexing Wharf for unloading. Taiwan and Shantou sugar also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Hai Su* ship and Landing Craft 104 arrived in Shanghai from Keelung and Shantou, bringing 1,100 tons of Taiwan sugar, 500 tons of Shantou brown sugar, and 600 tons of porcelain.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Increase, Second Grade Yellow Beans Surge and Then Slightly Retreat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 4,430 *shi* [unit of volume] plus 1,000 bags of customer goods were registered at the Nanshi market, and 2,139 *shi* arrived at the Beishi market. The Social Affairs Bureau sold more than 3,000 bags, totaling about 3,700 *shi*. The total for both the north and south markets reached more than 10,000 *shi*. There was no difference between *jengmi* [japonica rice] and *xianmi* [indica rice]. New *jengmi* rice was popular and quick to sell, while older rice was sluggish. New *xianmi* rice also increased and was quick to sell, while lower-grade goods showed fatigue. Only *baiyuan* [white round rice] was running out of stock and demand was strong, seeing an increase of 1,200 yuan. The supply and demand of flour was balanced, and the market trend was stable. Only miscellaneous high-grade flour showed a slight increase. Shantou wheat was moving but not strong, and the Ningbo merchants were fair, with the market trend secretly tightening. Interest from the north was easing, and white wheat was trading very little. Bran was selling in rural areas, and prices increased by 100 yuan. Although the arrival of yellow beans was scarce, after a sharp increase, the appetite of the shops eased, retreating by 1,000 yuan, forming a situation of a large increase and a small retreat. Raw peanuts remained strong. Yellow sesame seeds rose by 1,200 yuan. The oil market was flat and tired. The external appetite for soybean cakes has stopped, and there was no movement in rural sales, resulting in a sudden drop of 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Establishes a Branch Office in Gaoqiao</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) The commerce of Pudong has been most prosperous in towns such as Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Dongchang. In recent years, Gaoqiao has become even more prosperous due to the large volume of import and export goods passing through. Local shops, recognizing the need for closer business connections, initiated the organization of a chamber of commerce. Representatives were elected to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce also sent responsible officials to conduct on-site inspections. According to recent news, the Chamber of Commerce will approve the establishment of a branch office. However, the Pudong area is vast, with many towns, and the number of towns this branch office will govern is still under negotiation. It is heard that Dongchang and other towns have convenient direct communication with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, so they will likely remain directly under the jurisdiction of the Chamber of Commerce and will not be subordinate to the branch office. Pan Jueshen and other commercial leaders in the area also intended to organize a branch office, but because the Chamber of Commerce did not want to establish multiple branch agencies, and because Pudong is only separated by a river, communication is convenient. Therefore, this proposal has been abandoned. According to sources close to the Chamber of Commerce, Dongchang had such an organization during the occupation period, but with the current change in circumstances, it is no longer necessary. The branch office that Gaoqiao and other towns are planning to organize is only a temporary measure to remedy the current inconvenience of transportation for the more prosperous towns. Once transportation is convenient, its continued existence will be considered. The responsible officials of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also stated that the branch office is one of the Chamber’s office structure, under the jurisdiction of the Board of Directors. All matters must still be reported to the Board of Directors, and expenses will be allocated by the Chamber. Shops in various towns should directly join the relevant trade associations in the city, and then they can obtain contact with the Chamber of Commerce through the trade association. There are still many shops in various towns in Pudong that have not joined the trade associations, and they should be persuaded to join.</p>
<h3>The United States Revises Export Price To Prevent Overseas Inflation</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. Office of Price Administration announced that it has revised its regulations for pricing U.S. export goods, the purpose of which is to facilitate the pricing of export merchants. It does not however make any changes to the government’s pricing policies for export goods. The aim of the revision is to allow consumers in friendly countries to enjoy the same benefits under U.S. price controls as domestic consumers, and to prevent the price of U.S. goods in foreign markets from rising. Exporters selling goods to foreign countries will follow domestic price limits, with a reasonable profit, handling fees, and insurance costs added.</p>
<p>Also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently announced that the sale price of American food has increased by 31.3% since June 30, and has increased to more than 40% since Victory over Japan Day. In the week ending August 17, the sale price of food rose by 3.4%, and the sale price of grain products rose by 4.2%. The sale price of meat, dairy butter, butter, milk powder, and imitation butter continued to rise.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Discusses New Exchange Rate: Best to Contain Flexibility; Repeated Devaluation Only Makes the Black Market Rampant</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - The authoritative British economic publication "The Economist" commented on the recent devaluation of Chinese legal tender, stating that a flexible exchange rate policy, that is, setting the exchange rate daily based on market realities, is the only viable principle in the current environment. If the Chinese government does not adopt this principle, the recent difficulties will inevitably repeat themselves. Before the pressure of fundamental inflation can be stopped and prices no longer continue to rise, allowing the currency to devalue again after a period of time will cause foreign exchange transactions to stagnate, or cause the black market exchange rate to deviate from the official exchange rate and rise. It is also doubtful whether the recent actions of the Chinese government can correct trade imbalances. To save face, there is essentially no difference between a 40% devaluation and a 50% devaluation. China may now find that not only has it failed to save face, but it has also cut off its nose [to spite its face]. The new exchange rate announced on Monday is not surprising, but what is surprising is why the Chinese authorities waited so long to announce it. When the method of 2020 legal tender to one U.S. dollar was announced in March, it was originally thought that improvements in domestic transportation and the import of foreign goods could reduce the shortage of goods in various ports, especially Shanghai. New taxes and tariffs would be able to stop the leaks in inflation, and domestic peace would also help restore credit. Unexpectedly, these expectations have not been realized, and the new exchange rate of 2020 quickly became impractical. This exchange rate was once higher than the open market price, but this should be partly attributed to technical improvements in the Central Bank's foreign exchange management law. As the pressure of inflation increased, the open market price soared, and the control methods were only sufficient to make the mandatory official exchange rate more harmful than helpful. Smuggling became rampant, and the authorities had no choice but to devalue the legal tender by approximately 40%.</p>
<h3>Plan to Reduce Interest Arrears; Handling Fees Will Be Cancelled; Plan Awaiting Approval from the Central Bank; Implementation Expected Around the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that the issue of interest rates on interest arrears for customers of banks and money shops has been researched by a small group convened by the Bankers Association, which formulated a plan to cancel handling fees and uniformly collect 1.35 *jiao* [cents]. It is currently awaiting approval from the Central Bank. The implementation period is expected to be around the end of this month. According to money shop sources: Banks and money shops originally did not have a system of adding handling fees to interest arrears. A decision to add a handling fee of 100% of the interest arrears rate was made in February of this year. When it was first implemented, the banks and money shops often added 50% or 100% based on their own business situation, and it was not uniform. It was not until May that a uniform 100% was added. The interest rate for long-term interest arrears was 8 *fen* [cents] in June and July of this year, so after adding a handling fee of 100%, it was 1.6 *jiao*. To cancel the handling fee system and for ease of calculation, it is proposed to uniformly collect 1.35 *jiao*.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rayon to Arrive in Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>It is learned that 1.2 million pounds of Japanese rayon will be imported soon. Our government is currently discussing this matter with General MacArthur's headquarters, and it will still be handled by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade. The rapidly rising market price of domestic rayon will be severely affected.</p>
<p>Blue Tiles Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for bricks and ash was slightly weak. However, because of the decrease in actual sales of blue roof tiles, the price fell from over 400,000 yuan per 10,000 to 367,000 yuan. The market for cement was chaotic for a time, but has now returned to 8,500 yuan per bag.</p>
<p>Hardware Rises 20-30%</p>
<p>Among hardware, except for a few items that are still prospering, the situation is generally gradually stabilizing, with gains of about 20-30%. Dog-brand door locks are still being sold at the original price due to the factory’s painful supply. Many files have arrived, making it difficult to see improvement. Because the season for green silk cloth has passed, there are bids but few transactions.</p>
<h3>Minister Wang Hopes for Cooperation from Merchants and Businessmen; Silk Purchasing Policy Determined, Tea Policy Undecided; Loans Not Restricted; Enemy Factories Sold Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs answered many questions from reporters yesterday. Apart from the cotton yarn issue, which is covered in a separate article, the other points are all important. A summary of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The modification of import tariffs is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>(2) It has now been decided that the Central Trust Bureau will purchase raw silk, and the purchasing methods have also been determined. As for whether to adopt a purchasing policy for tea leaves or a subsidy export method, a decision has not yet been made.</p>
<p>(3) In order to assist and guide private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions, and to provide technical and methodological assistance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has proposed to the Executive Yuan to establish industrial and commercial supervisory groups in various industrial and commercial centers across the country. Currently, these groups have not been established because the organizational regulations have not yet been drafted.</p>
<p>(4) Industrial and commercial loans, if of a legitimate nature and urgently needed, will still be considered for lending, and there will be no special tightening due to the adjustment of exchange rates.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the sale of enemy and puppet factories, in addition to preferential treatment for 22 factories in the rear, which are currently being inspected and having contracts negotiated, a batch of enemy and puppet factories that have been offered for sale twice but have not yet been sold have been notified to the China Industrial Association and the United Association of Factories Moving to Sichuan and Guangxi, etc., requesting them to inform their member factories to visit the factories separately from August 15th to the end of August. September 1st to 5th will be the period for factories to apply for purchase. These two stipulated deadlines will be extended by five days each if required by actual circumstances.</p>
<p>(6) The Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed at the end of September. Unfinished matters are currently being expedited.</p>
<p>(7) This time, the government's adjustment of exchange rates was a unanimous request from the export industry and the industrial and commercial sectors. After consideration, the government believes that this measure is necessary and has resolutely implemented the adjustment. However, the implementation of national laws also relies on the assistance of the people. When I traveled to the UK in the past, I deeply felt that the success of price management in that country lies in the people's ability to strictly abide by and implement every word and phrase of the laws. After the government's adjustment of exchange rates this time, the cost of foreign goods will increase, which will inevitably lead to price increases. However, there is absolutely no reason for domestic goods to increase in price. Otherwise, the government will definitely take action. Currently, the state-owned enterprises are determined to maintain the original prices of their products and will not increase them. I sincerely hope that the people will fully assist the government in this decision to respect public opinion and implement policies.</p>

<h3>The Location of the Descendants of Zhuge Wuhou: The Undetermined Sino-Burmese Border, Kawa Mountain</h3>
<p>— By Special Correspondent Zhang Shenglin, dated the 12th</p>
<p>People of the Yi and Kawa ethnic groups in Cangyuan, western Yunnan, recently sent representatives to Kunming to present border conditions to the Yunnan provincial authorities, and presented a "Benefit the Borderlands" banner to Chairman Lu Han. This reporter visited Luo Yaocai, the guide of the representatives, who provided detailed information about the Kawa area.</p>
<p>Kawa Mountain (referred to as the Kawa area) is located east of the Nu River and west of the Lancang River, bordering Myanmar to the west and connecting to Huanluo to the south. This area remains an undetermined Sino-Burmese border to this day. The main ethnic groups are the Kawa and Bai Yi. During the Sino-Burmese border survey, Han Hua Xiang, the deceased Dong Tusi (native chieftain) of Mengjiao in Cangyuan, said to the British: "My ancestors have guarded the border for the motherland for generations and have received the motherland's favor. Although our Yi and Kawa ethnic groups are backward border people, we are also East Asian Mongoloids. Our noses and eyes are different from your country. How can we be governed by foreigners and become sinners of our motherland?" This diplomatic statement is sufficient to prove the loyalty of the border people.</p>
<p>According to the discussion, the current Kawa area faces two serious problems: one is the migration of the Kawa people, and the other is the invasion of the Lao Kang people (savages). A small number of Han people who cannot survive in the interior often enter the Kawa area to live. They often use deception or extortion, causing the border people to suffer and migrate abroad one after another. Once they cross the Nu River, the British give them dozens of rupees and one or two oxen, and they can live and work in peace. Every year, about hundreds of households migrate for this reason. If this continues, the population of the border area will inevitably decrease day by day. This is one of the serious problems. The Lao Kang people (belonging to Myanmar), who are neighbors of the Kawa area, have superior firearms and new tactics, and often use guerrilla tactics to harass the border people, intending to occupy important strongholds in the Kawa area. Although a part of the national army is stationed in Hong and Meng, they feel quite troubled due to certain reasons, which makes the border people often feel uneasy. This serious problem cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The terrain of the Kawa area is most dangerous at "Kongming Mountain," which has the potential of one man holding the pass against ten thousand. The mountain is about 5,000 feet above sea level. Looking around from the top of the mountain, the lands of the seventeen Kawa kings are clearly visible. Years ago, the British changed the name of this mountain to "Citizen Mountain," but the people in the area still use the old name. The Kawa people often say: "Our Kawa people are the descendants of Zhuge Wuhou. Zhuge Wuhou was a meritorious minister of China, so the Kawa people are naturally Chinese citizens." According to legend, when Kongming marched south, he camped in the Kawa area for several days, leaving behind a large iron cannon that has long been buried in the soil. Folk tales say that if there is an incident or struggle in the Kawa area, the cannon will make a sound first, and the length of the sound will indicate the scale of the battle. Although this is a superstition, it is enough to prove the border people's belief in Kongming.</p>
<p>The climate in the Kawa area is slightly hot, and without sudden dramatic changes, it is difficult to distinguish the four seasons. The average temperature in summer is around 80 degrees Celsius, and the highest point is no more than 90 degrees Celsius. In winter, it is above 30 degrees Celsius. The plants are mostly chestnut and fruit trees, with few pines and cypresses. The main agricultural product is rice, and no miscellaneous grains are planted. Mineral deposits are abundant but undeveloped.</p>
<p>The politics of the Kawa area are still ruled by individual kings. The more prominent ones are the kings of Banyang, Made, Molie, Yingen, Yonghe, Banhong, Jianlong, Bankang, Banlao, Tatian, Shaoqing, Yileng, Wusu, Gansan, Manhui, Yide, and Guanzhong. In addition, there are other titles such as small king and mountain official. Among them, the King of Banyang is the head of the seventeen kings, with a jurisdiction of about 60,000 households, and the most firearms and property. The next are the kings of Molie, Yingen, and Made, who are also very powerful. The kings are all hereditary, adopting a "select the eldest (son), not the capable" system. In the past, they fought each other, with the strong preying on the weak, forming a situation where each dominates one side, maintaining a primitive tribal life. Under the king's palace, there are large and small "Gongtou," equivalent to the Baojia heads of the Han people, who are all unpaid. The king's troops are scattered among the people, which is actually "soldiers in the border." The total population of the Kawa area is about 1.5 million, with an average of one gun for every five people. Ancient bows and swords are still their commonly used weapons. The kings do not work, and their task is to manage the people in their jurisdiction. Civil and criminal cases are all handled according to customary law. There are no prisons, only corporal punishment and fines. The kings live a simple life, and their clothes are not much different from those of the people. Their greatest enjoyment is to kill a few more cattle than the people. Among the seventeen kings, only the King of Banhong lives in a tiled house, while the others live in thatched houses. Although they already use bowls for eating, they still do not use chopsticks. Only the King of Banhong uses chopsticks. The reason for this is that the King of Banhong's wife is a Kunming woman, and many of her living habits have been Sinicized.</p>
<p>In the entire Kawa Mountain area, the Kawa people account for 80 to 90 percent, and they are divided into "wild" and "pure." The pure Kawa are slightly similar to the Han people. The wild Kawa retain the customs of ancient ethnic groups. They are warlike and have the custom of taking human heads. Every February and August, they use "chicken divination" to determine which direction is most auspicious, and then set off in large numbers to take human heads to sacrifice to the seedlings. Between Xin Difang and Yonghe King, there is a headhunting village. Wooden poles are erected outside the village, and after obtaining the heads, they are hung on the walls and wooden poles. Those with the best performance are given red headscarves. Among the wild Kawa, there is still human head compensation. For example, if ten human heads are needed for the seedling sacrifice next year, anyone who agrees to undertake the task can receive the full price in advance. If they cannot deliver the required number by the deadline, the heads of the undertaker's family members will be used as collateral.</p>
<p>The Kawa people do not wash their faces and use their fingers to eat. When the Han people taught them to use chopsticks, the Kawa replied: "We were born with five fingers for grasping food, which is already convenient. If the Han people use chopsticks and get into a fight while eating, they can poke eyes with the chopsticks, isn't that too barbaric?" The Kawa people like to eat smelly things, and the Bai Yi people like to eat sour things, hence the saying "sour Bai Yi, smelly Kawa."</p>
<p>The Kawa people have freedom of marriage. Men and women can get married as long as they are in love. The wedding ceremony is simple. Relatives give tea bran as gifts, and the host provides wine and food. Before marriage, men can talk and laugh with any girl. After marriage, they are strictly restricted. If they have a relationship with other women, they will be fined. Unmarried men like to play the three-stringed lute. If they are admired by a girl, they can live together, and their parents are proud of it.</p>
<p>The Bai Yi people can withstand the heat and live on the plains. They are harmonious in nature and speak fluent Chinese. The men are healthy and their clothing, food, and lodging are much the same as those of the Han people. The women are beautiful and superior to the Han people in the area. They wear skirts and short jackets, and 90% of them do not wear shoes or socks. They love cleanliness and bathe frequently. They like to dye their teeth black for decoration. They like to wear silver earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and small bells. Their language is clear and pleasant to listen to, which is unmatched by other ethnic groups. The languages in the Kawa area are Bai Yi and Kawa, with the former being more common and easier to learn. In recent years, Han-Yi trade and intermarriage have become more common, and the inland culture has been slightly introduced.</p>
<p>After the introduction of Christianity to the Kawa area, less than 1% of the people are literate. The Bai Yi people believe in Burmese temples, which are their educational institutions. There is one elder, several monks, and many young monks. Bai Yi men are sent to the temple to study Bai Yi literature (Bai Yi scriptures) when they are young. Every village of the Bai Yi ethnic group has a Burmese temple. Pure Kawa also have this temple, but the number is small. The Kawa people believe in churches and shamans. They do not seek medical treatment when they are sick. If the chanting does not cure them, they await their death. The power of the church in the Kawa area is very strong. During the Anti-Japanese War, the missionaries intensified their work and created the Kawa script, so that today, many people in the Kawa area can use this script to communicate.</p>
<p>There are no formal shops in the Kawa area. They hold a street market every five days. In addition to various daily necessities, cosmetics and food can also be purchased. The prices are extremely expensive, and the prices of supplies are very low. The purpose of the Han people who go to do business is to exchange for opium dross, so they sell the goods they bring at low prices, which naturally stabilizes the prices. Transactions in the Kawa area do not use banknotes, but still use silver dollars. In the areas of Banshan, Mandun, Nankanwu, Dazhongnong, and Xiaozhongnong, in addition to silver dollars, rupees are also in circulation. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Kawa merchants often went to Lashio to do business, and even went as far as Mandalay. However, since Myanmar fell, the commercial relationship between the Kawa area and Myanmar has come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Nan Tianfu, a representative of the Kawa and Yi ethnic groups, spent 19 days on his way from Cangyuan to Kunming this time. His main task was to express the will and recent situation of the border people, hoping that the inland compatriots would provide more guidance and assistance so that the border area could be developed as soon as possible. He also hoped that the local authorities would truly do the four words "Benefit the Borderlands."</p>
<h3>The Heroic Female Police Recruits</h3>
<p>The graduation ceremony for the fourth class of police recruits at the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Training Institute was held yesterday!</p>
<p>We know that our country's police administration is gradually improving. What is expected of these police recruits is extremely earnest, and there is especially a lot of attention on the female police!</p>

These female police officers have all received junior high school education and have completed training at the Shanghai Municipal Police Training Institute with excellent results. In order to enable them to enrich their service experience, this service will still be treated as an internship, and they will not be formally employed until after four months. Yesterday afternoon, the female police officers had already moved into the Fuzhou Road Police Station and will be assigned to various branch stations tomorrow. Most of them are from Zhejiang, with sound physical condition and high spirits. Whether in attitude or training, they are incomparable to the female police of the past, and can be said to open up a new atmosphere in the city's police force.</p>

<h3>Xiao Shaohang's Footprints</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Shaoxing, 18th</p>
<p>While listening to the sound of the spring at Wuliting in Tianmu Mountain, Mr. Shen Chengzhang, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, said to the reporter: "We are going to the Ning Shao area next time, would you like to go with us?"</p>
<p>At 7:00 am on August 16th, Mr. Shen Chengzhang, Yu Zhongji, Li Yizhi, Zhang Zichun, Brother Tian Dewan, and the reporter set off for Ning Shao. First, we took a train to Changxing Township, which belongs to Xiaoshan County. Many people were waiting there to welcome us. Then we went to Xijiangtang. A 71-year-old man explained how important Xijiangtang is, even saying that if Xijiangtang breaches, the Xiaoshao area will become a swamp, and any solid engineering of the Wen family will be useless. He further emphasized that this is the back door of Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, and is the water long wall defending Xiaoshao.</p>
<p>Rice and Wheat Harvests are Good, Cotton May Be Affected by Rain</p>
<p>He also led us to inspect the Pantou Panjian area, about three miles from the Tang. Most of the Pantou Panjian have become land, and Xijiangtang is also a muddy pond. It is conceivable that it is not as serious as the Haining and Haiyan sections, but the fact remains that it has been in disrepair for many years. The old man and the township chief then submitted a petition to Mr. Shen, requesting that the airport designated by the aviation authorities be exempted from development, and knelt down to express their sorrowful pleas. Mr. Shen and we went to inspect the designated airport. As we approached the designated location, many local women knelt down with incense and blocked the way. The township chief repeatedly shouted: "If you have any requests, send a representative. I cannot be responsible for such requests." Mr. Shen was compassionate and finally agreed to their request to transfer the matter to the aviation authorities before leaving Xiaoshan.</p>
<p>We changed to a large truck and went to Xiaoshan. It took less than an hour to reach the county seat. This place is already within the ancient Yue Kingdom, and the famous doctor Fan Li was born in Xixing Township, which belongs to the county. Although the county seat has also been destroyed by the enemy puppets, it is much better than Yuhang, Lin'an, and Yuqian. The county government is temporarily located in the home of a former pawnshop with a Nanmu hall. This shows the wealth of Xiaoshan County before the war and also shows that the damage was not very serious. Xiaoshan is dominated by agricultural products, with cotton and tobacco being the special products among agricultural products. The rice and wheat harvests are still good this year, but the cotton may be affected by too much rain, and the tobacco leaves are not as good as before. The output is probably less than 5 million tons of cotton before the war, and about 3 million tons of tobacco leaves. I asked the local people, and they all said that the most important problem now is riverbank collapse, which is said to have collapsed 520,000 mu. From February to August this year, it collapsed 88,000 mu, and about 70,000 people are in urgent need of relief. They hope that the government will quickly build embankments to defend against the water. Little do they know that it is absolutely impossible to change the course of the river unless the entire riverbed is stabilized. People in the county are requesting this because the government is now paying attention to building embankments and defending against water. Of course, riverbank collapse is a very serious problem, but stabilizing the riverbed is not something that can be done overnight, so simply building embankments and defending against water has lost its value of permanent effect.</p>
<p>Prices are Lower Than in Hangzhou, County Government Work Still Needs Efforts</p>
<p>Prices in Xiaoshan are already lower than in Hangzhou, and the people seem to be living slightly better than in Chu, Changhua. The county has highways and railways, and transportation is relatively convenient. However, when it comes to reconstruction, it has not yet reached the saturation point, because the people's lives are still much worse than before the war. The population is also smaller than before the war. Therefore, those who work in the county government should not only not be satisfied but also intensify their efforts. To be honest, the current stage of county government work in Xiaoshan is not ideal enough. For example, Xiang Lake, which is a relatively easy area to develop, can be used to raise fish and cultivate land by using the victims of riverbank collapse, and developed into a scenic area. The current situation is far from what the ancients described in their poems: "Spring is about to end in front of Beigan Mountain, A Zi goes to Caiyi Lake to pick water caltrop. Lotus roots and water caltrop leaves fill the lake, and the boat does not know where to go." Instead, it is a desolate sight, with weeds growing everywhere. This is the point where the work of the county-level workers is not ideal enough. But perhaps it is a matter of time.</p>
<p>After lunch in Xiaoshan, we drove to Shaoxing. Shaoxing is the ancient capital of the Yue King Goujian, and it is also the place where Yu the Great, who tamed the floods, died and was buried, and the place where Jin Wang Xizhi wrote the Lanting Collection and was buried. It is the hometown of revolutionary martyrs Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin, and the hometown of contemporary celebrities Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, Lu Xun, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Zhuotang.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Suffered Less Damage, Population Only 840,000</p>
<p>The damage here is even less, and the city is as complete as before, but the population was 1.2 million before the war, and now it is only 840,000. The land area is 2.4 million mu, of which 2 million mu can be cultivated. There are 97 central schools, 507 national schools, and 3 private primary schools. There are 47,703 children out of school, 165,593 adults out of school, and 85,044 women out of school. The special products here are the famous Shaoxing rice wine, tin foil, freshwater fish, and silk. Before the war, more than 100,000 jars of wine were brewed every year, but now it has been sharply reduced to one-fifth, with only more than 20,000 jars. The raw materials for brewing wine are mainly glutinous rice and distiller's yeast, which are not produced locally but are made from glutinous rice from Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, Jiaxing and other places. In addition to the famous Zhuangyuanhong, Jiafan, Zhuyeqing, Shanliang, and Huadiao, Shaoxing rice wine also has a type called "Daughter Wine," which is the most intoxicating. It is said that wealthy families process and make a jar or several jars of wine after giving birth to a daughter, seal it tightly after brewing, and bury it under the soil of the road that must be passed at home, so that people trample on it. When the daughter grows up, the wine is taken out to entertain guests, and its color is very mellow, in order to win the praise of the drinkers.</p>
<p>The Problem of Tin Foil Workers Changing Careers Falls on the Administrative Staff</p>
<p>Tin foil is used for worship or burning incense. It is made by hammering a piece of tin into an extremely thin sheet and applying it to thin paper, which is then sold on the market. People in the north and south of the Yangtze River buy it and fold it into money ingots to burn to express their worship. Although this tin foil has a superstitious color, nearly 200,000 people depend on it for a living. The raw materials for tin come from Hong Kong, Yunnan, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Tunxi, Ningbo, and other places. At least 40,000 pieces of tin foil are exported every month, and up to 80,000 pieces. In terms of taxation, the county has a tax rate of 15 percent, and can collect at least 60 million yuan per month, and at most 180 million yuan, which shows its abundant income. Now the central government has recovered the unified tax, and the tax evasion is 60 percent. Many tin foil workers know that the times are becoming more civilized day by day, and this industry is not a permanent thing after all. Therefore, they also demand to change careers, but this responsibility falls on the administrative staff. It is said that Fan Li made a fortune by raising snails in Nanchi, and he gathered and scattered his wealth three times. This kind of fish pond area is about 100,000 mu in Shaoxing, and there are about 5,000 to 6,000 fishermen. Around 1921, more than 2 million jin of fish were produced. When Shaoxing fell into the hands of the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, reconstruction was difficult after the Anti-Japanese War. It is estimated that 1,800 pieces of fishing gear were lost, and 80 to 90 percent of the materials were lost. All the fishing villages went bankrupt. In the future, we should actively support them and actively improve the methods of fish farming. Regarding silk, I have already mentioned it in the article "Everywhere Smoke, Hangzhou Silk Sales to the North are Hopeless." It is roughly the same as what I said.</p>
<p>Promote Goujian's Spirit, Strive for Opportunities for Recuperation and Education</p>
<p>We went to see the place where the Confucian Temple was performing when Shaoxing fell, where there were water prisons and dog torture grounds when the enemy was there, and we deeply felt the brutality of the enemy.</p>
<p>We also went to visit the Sanjiang Dam, where the Cao'e, Qiantang, and Qianqing rivers meet. It is said that the Sanjiang Dam was built by Tang Shaoen during the Ming Dynasty, and the local farmland and water conservancy benefited a lot. Therefore, there is a Tang Gong Temple building in the local area. The collapsed part has been repaired by the government, and the inclined pond 1.5 kilometers from Sanjiang Dam is also being renovated.</p>
<p>In Shaoxing, we went to the Fengyuting Pavilion of Qiu Jin's Martyr, "Autumn wind, autumn rain, sad to death," and to the Wanghaiting Pavilion, which can overlook the East China Sea. We visited the Yu Mausoleum and the Lanting Pavilion, and felt that it was necessary to renovate them. And the historically famous Yue Wang Mausoleum has been demolished by the Japanese and no longer exists. Yes, the spirit of the Yue King Goujian can indeed make the Japanese see and hate. As long as we maintain this spirit, we will definitely become rich and strong. But with the smoke of war in the country, how can we have time to recuperate and educate? We feel that it is necessary to rebuild the Yue Wang Mausoleum. Although this is not an urgent task, it cannot be said to be insignificant for the meaning and value of education.</p>

<h3>Reviewing the Problem of Long-Term Savings Before the War</h3>
<p>— Shu Lu</p>
<p>After our nation's victory, economic recovery has not been standardized, leading to a daily decline in currency value. Compared to pre-war prices, some items are five thousand times more expensive, while others are ten thousand times more expensive. Consequently, the issue of repaying long-term savings and life insurance premiums from before the war has caused endless complications. Recently, there was a lawsuit where someone with a two thousand yuan savings deposit requested a three thousand yuan loan to pay off the principal and interest. The court ruled that they should be paid one thousand times the original amount (as reported in recent newspapers). It is rumored that financial institutions in Hankou similarly paid out pre-war deposits at five thousand times their original value last winter in a similar case. Long-term savings are mostly intended for living expenses. When the currency value drops to several thousand times less, it becomes almost impossible to survive. Therefore, to survive, people must struggle. If they cannot succeed through struggle, they resort to legal action, which seems natural. Furthermore, the government promulgated the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure on December 18, 1945. Article 12 concerning pre-war legal acts states: "If, after a legal act is established, circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to a reasonable person, and this was unforeseeable at the time, and the original effect is manifestly unfair, the court shall fairly adjudicate, increasing or decreasing payments or changing other original effects." Therefore, legally speaking, fairness is the principle, and the original effect can be changed. Now, let's consider the issue practically. Should pre-war long-term savings and life insurance premiums be repaid according to the original amount, or should they be paid according to the increased currency value? If they are paid according to the increased currency value, first, do banks have the ability to do so? Second, should depositors enjoy this right? Third, will national economic recovery be affected? All of these issues deserve further review.</p>
<p>First, can banks afford to repay pre-war long-term savings at the increased currency value? Before the war, in addition to state-owned banks, most commercial banks in our country had capital of four to five million yuan (some had seven and a half million yuan), while others had only two hundred and fifty thousand yuan. However, the total amount of long-term savings for each bank ranged from fifty to sixty million yuan to eighty to ninety million yuan for larger banks, and one to two million yuan for smaller banks, approximately ten times the bank's own capital. In other words, the bank's capital only accounted for ten percent of the long-term savings. Therefore, the interests of depositors are more important and significant than those of bank shareholders. As for the total operating amount of each bank, some reached as high as one hundred forty to one hundred fifty million yuan to over two hundred million yuan, nearly twenty to thirty times their capital. These funds rely entirely on the fluid capital collected from depositors and entrusted to the bank for management. Furthermore, the investment avenues of banks and life insurance companies are mostly in real estate or foreign currency securities, or even self-operated factories, due to the long-term nature of the funds. Taking real estate as an example, a property worth only two to three thousand legal tender before the war now sells for five to six hundred taels of gold, which, calculated at twenty thousand legal tender per tael of gold, amounts to over one hundred million legal tender, approximately five thousand times the pre-war value. In addition, the current value of all foreign currency securities and self-operated factories has also increased by thousands, even tens of thousands of times compared to before the war. If the court rules to repay pre-war long-term savings at one thousand times their original value, banks and life insurance companies can easily meet the obligation by selling a small portion of their assets, without shaking their foundations.</p>
<p>Second, should depositors have the right to withdraw long-term deposits at the increased currency value?</p>
<p>The primary task of a bank is to regulate surpluses and deficits. It absorbs deposits, gathers fluid capital, accumulates small amounts into large ones, and provides financial assistance to agriculture, industry, and commerce for profit. Therefore, it regulates the surplus fluid capital of depositors and addresses the capital deficit of agriculture, industry, and commerce. It essentially acts as a trustee managing funds and distributing profits. Part of the earnings is used as compensation for the managers, and part is used as dividends for the depositors. This distribution is generally balanced, without being excessively burdensome or lenient. Before the war, China's finances were stable, and profitable businesses generated meager profits. Safe investments yielded only about four to five percent. Therefore, at that time, the interest rate for long-term deposits, depending on the duration, was as high as one point seven or eight percent to two percent, accounting for about forty percent of the profit. The bank, as the manager, accounted for about sixty percent of the profit and had to bear all expenses. This allocation of benefits was very fair, so depositors were happy to accept it without complaint. Furthermore, depositors who made long-term deposits generally had specific purposes: some relied on the interest for regular living expenses; some set it aside for retirement and funeral expenses; some saved it for their children's education. Once the currency value plummets drastically, what used to be one hundred yuan could support a child's education for a year, but now it's only enough to buy a notebook. Therefore, the intended purpose can no longer be sustained. Superficially, this may not seem attributable to banks and life insurance companies, but in reality, it is. The existing assets of banks or life insurance companies have increased more than ten thousand times compared to pre-war levels. Ninety percent of the original funds for these assets came from long-term deposits. At the same time, due to the increased value of assets, like other commercial companies, they have all increased capital and distributed stock dividends. Now that the shareholders, who account for ten percent of the operating capital, have enjoyed the right to increase capital and distribute stock dividends (in other words, profit-sharing), long-term depositors, who account for ninety percent of the operating capital, should rightfully enjoy the same right to share profits. Moreover, when depositors deposit their funds with the bank as long-term deposits, it essentially implies a trust for management. Sharing profits is their rightful entitlement. Therefore, banks and life insurance companies should not repay these long-term deposits at the pre-war currency amount but should pay them at the increased currency value. Otherwise, those entrusted with management would seem to monopolize the profits.</p>
<p>Third, will national economic recovery be affected? After the government established the legal tender policy in 1936, coupled with abundant agricultural harvests and active industrial and commercial activities, bank deposits suddenly swelled. At that time, one US dollar was worth only three legal tender yuan, representing China's economic golden age. Due to the abundance of bank funds, agriculture, industry, and commerce were given as much assistance as possible, and loans of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan were readily granted; loans of twenty to thirty thousand yuan were even more common. The banks' extensive assistance allowed agriculture, industry, and commerce to flourish, creating the pre-war economic golden age. The strong performance of national capital during the war of resistance can be traced back to this period, to the banks having sufficient funds to assist agriculture, industry, and commerce, thereby creating this robust national capital. However, the banks' abundant funds relied on small depositors' long-term deposits. Therefore, it is the financial industry that utilizes national capital, and it is the small, long-term depositors who gather it. The strength or weakness of national capital depends entirely on the efforts of those who gather it. After the Franco-Prussian War, France was able to quickly pay the indemnity and recover rapidly, thanks to the French people's efforts in saving. Now, although our nation has declared victory, economic recovery is still a distant prospect. National capital has become increasingly weak. The number of long-term deposits at banks may have increased, but the quality has inevitably decreased significantly. What used to be a common loan of twenty to thirty thousand yuan (now two to three hundred million yuan) now requires much consideration and is difficult to handle. As for loans of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan (now tens of billions to hundreds of billions yuan) deemed acceptable before the war, most banks no longer have the individual capacity to handle them. Although a large portion of the funds is still frozen, new long-term deposits are rarely made. It is impossible to provide as much assistance to agriculture, industry, and commerce as before the war. Long-term depositors, fearing that long-term deposits are like setting a trap for themselves, have become wary and no longer trust banks for entrusted management, instead engaging in their own speculation or hoarding. However, speculation and hoarding are investments that cannot produce anything, so the overall national capital is dwindling, not increasing. It should be understood that the financial industry has a responsibility to assist in the nation's economic recovery. The dissipation of national capital is a major obstacle to economic recovery. Therefore, for the sake of the financial industry, efforts should be made to encourage savings and attract fluid capital, to both enrich its own funds and help the nation's economic recovery. Paying back pre-war long-term deposits at the increased currency value is not only a way to encourage savings and attract fluid capital but also greatly benefits the function of our nation's economic recovery.</p>
<p>In summary, the courts have made clear rulings, and the facts are consistent with reason and sentiment. The impact on individual depositors is small, but the impact on the dissipation of overall national capital, which hinders national economic recovery, is significant. Our nation's financial industry has no shortage of wise individuals who will likely share this view. I offer my humble opinion in the hope of sparking further and more reasonable discussion.</p>
<p>(Author's Note): This article is limited to long-term deposits and does not discuss public bonds. However, recent court cases have caused a surge in public bond prices. We must understand that public bonds and long-term deposits are fundamentally different. The issuance of public bonds is due to the nation's urgent need for funds. Collecting taxes is too slow, so borrowing is necessary as an emergency measure, like emergency medicine. Funds are collected and immediately spent, unlike long-term deposits, which are managed by banks for profit. Moreover, national expenditures are ultimately derived from the people. Repaying debts at the increased currency value is equivalent to increasing the burden on all citizens. Therefore, valuing public bonds in terms of the increased currency value is neither reasonable nor justifiable. We should not be misled by speculators.</p>

<h3>Returning Home Armed: Tales of Ru River</h3>
<p>— Tenth Day News Report, Zeng Xiong and Bai Ming</p>
<p>Months of hunger and cold, months of suffering, what unbearable times those were! During those days, wanderers dreamed of returning home day and night! Finally, that day has arrived. Indeed, that day was earned with blood!</p>
<p>On the morning of July 31st, along the road in the vicinity of Nantong West Park, fifty or sixty neat military trucks and more than twenty cars were densely lined up. As the morning light gently shone, many refugees were already gathering here one after another. The reporter was also among them, seeing many familiar faces, exchanging smiles with each other, it is not difficult to imagine how happy they were in their hearts!</p>
<p>Squads of strong soldiers also arrived here one after another. Under the command and allocation of the officers, they quickly boarded the trucks, their mission was to escort us back home.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, the entire team was assembled on the trucks, and over two hundred refugees each entered the cars. At the front, more than thirty trucks filled with soldiers began to move forward, and our cars followed closely behind. Looking again at the back, the loud roar of the engines brought more than thirty trucks of strong soldiers.</p>
<p>The Tongru Highway, recently renovated, has not been completely paved, and the car jolted very badly when passing through low-lying areas. Along the way, road guards, armed with American-style carbines, were stationed on both sides of the highway. From the guard posts, one could see the dark faces in front and behind, covered with steel helmets, gripping the carbines nervously, seeing off our lengthy convoy with a solemn attitude. Two beetle-like armored vehicles, equipped with small steel cannons, patrolled back and forth from time to time. At each stronghold, large numbers of reinforcing troops could be seen, ready to be dispatched. For our return home, tens of thousands of friends in the army have worked hard. In the army, I thought about how we should pay them the highest respect!</p>
<p>More than ninety cars of all sizes, after passing through Dingnian Town, gradually accelerated and moved forward. The fields in mid-summer were still so simple, with high corn stalks and deep yellow rice ears, interspersed in a vast plain. In the car, witnessing those mature crops, knowing that this is a harvest year, but not seeing a single farming family busy harvesting. These crops abandoned due to the war, I think are still plentiful in China today. A country exhausted by the eight years of war of resistance, is still reenacting these tragic scenes amidst the calls for demobilization today, I can't help but curse reality!</p>
<p>Four or five miles away from Dingnian Town, this place was a battlefield for a seesaw battle just ten days ago. Entire rice paddies were burned black, and broken walls and ruins were visible everywhere. The remains of those who died in battle on both sides of the highway have not yet been buried. Exposed to the scorching sun, flies gathered and maggots wriggled, making it impossible to distinguish their faces, eyes, ears, nose, and other organs. Red and white intermingled, becoming a blurred mass. Waves of foul odors were sent into the nose, making one want to vomit. Although we in the car had prepared handkerchiefs smeared with balm as masks, it was of no use. In the unbearable stench of corpses, the cars passed through dust mixed with blood, stirring up heights of several feet. We proceeded for more than twenty miles, gradually seeing the several tall buildings of Ru City.</p>
<p>Main Points of Communist Army Actions: Forming Armies and Collecting Grain, Stopping at Nothing</p>
<p>When the reporter met with Mr. Zhong Xiangzhen, the captain of the Third Battalion of the Seventh Corps of the Traffic Police here, he told the reporter many things about the Communist army's indiscriminate actions in the Rugao area. The main points are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Organizing Militias to Serve as Cannon Fodder - Each township organizes a militia battalion, which has three companies, each company has three or four platoons, (that is, one platoon per Bao). In peacetime, they are used for sentry duty and gathering military intelligence. During wartime, the militia organization is used as a shock troop, charging in the first and second lines to deplete our ammunition and explore our troop deployment. Afterwards, the field army would pounce on our weaknesses. Moreover, whoever in the populace doesn't participate in the militia, their house will be sealed and grain fined (two Shi of barley). In the Dingnian campaign, there were as many as three hundred militiamen used as cannon fodder.</p>
<p>(2) Extensively徵收公糧, the People are Unable to Survive - The annual taxes are collected twice in the summer and autumn. The summer tax is wheat, and the autumn tax is rice seeds. The highest amount per Mu is 14 Jin. For every Jin of grain, a half Jin of grass is also taxed. It is estimated that each village (Bao) has about a hundred Shi.</p>
<p>(3) Confiscating Property of "Counter-revolutionaries," Enriching Private Pockets - Anyone who has held a position in the "puppet" regime for even one day will be punished. All of their property will be confiscated and said to be distributed to the common people, to help the poor turn over, but in reality, the township and village chiefs have made a fortune, and the common people are still at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>(4) Using Others to Kill, Harshly Punishing Traitors - When a traitor is arrested, a public trial is convened. Clearly wanting to kill him, they feign asking the public whether they want to kill him or not. The masses are merely puppets, how dare they shout "Don't kill"? Therefore, they say that this is the opinion of the masses, not the government wanting to kill. Another type is that a wooden sign is hung around the neck called a "Traitor" sign, weighing about three or four Jin. The sign says "Traitor who sells the country, so-and-so." They are confined to their homes, called "sitting in the people's prison," for a maximum of ten years. They are also ordered to wear the sign, red clothes, and a tall hat every day, doing hard labor such as cleaning streets and toilets. If they go out without wearing the sign and red clothes, they will be beaten at any time.</p>
<p>(5) Inciting Tenant Farmers, Mistreating Landlords - They organize peasant associations and turn-over associations to settle accounts with landlords. The rent exceeding the 25% rent reduction before 1937 that landlords charged is collected, and the rental deposit paid by tenant farmers when renting land is returned, forcing landlords to clear out all of their fields. This is called the "Overturning Rent and Interest" movement. If the landlords refuse to do so, they will smear Tung oil and lime on the landlord's face, tie him up, wear a tall hat, and beat him along the village, or erect a high platform and instruct the landlord to stand on it and wave his hand, shouting, "Save me, Old Central Government," etc.</p>
<p>(6) Distributing Land According to Population, Issuing Grain Based on the Number of People - Each person is allocated land to cultivate, and the grain harvested is handed over to the public. Then, the public issues grain according to the population. This makes the people indifferent to diligence or laziness, resulting in the abandonment of fields and reduced production.</p>
<p>(7) Banning Monks and Nuns, Prohibiting Ancestral Rituals - They force monks and nuns to grow their hair and return to secular life, marry wives and husbands. All ancestral rituals are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>(8) Listening to Walls at Night, Smelling Fragrance in the Daytime - They organize listening groups to secretly listen for counter-revolutionary remarks at people's homes at night. They organize smelling teams during the day. If they smell fragrance (such as meat or fish) from someone's home, they go to that house to inquire about the reason for eating meat or fish. Besides asking people to intercede, they will suffer interference.</p>
<p>(9) Banning Matchmakers, Promoting Elopement - When men and women reach adulthood, if a matchmaker introduces them to marriage, pork will be hung around the matchmaker's neck, saying that they are people who like to eat, that's why they are matchmakers. Their meaning is that as long as both men and women agree, they can become husband and wife.</p>
<p>(10) Mobilizing Children to Confront Respected Relatives - They organize children's groups, which, in addition to helping the militia stand guard, specialize in confronting stubborn parents. If a child is punished by a parent, the entire children's group will confront them.</p>
<p>(11) Falsely Claiming Democracy, Practicing Dictatorship - Their government's organization is the "Three-Third System," that is, the Nationalist Party occupies one-third, the Communist Party occupies one-third, and non-partisans occupy one-third. In reality, the Nationalist Party will be judged for being Kuomintang spies, and non-partisans will be judged for being non-partisan, so officials in all departments must be Communist Party members.</p>
<p>(12) Selling Out the Motherland, Allowing Themselves to Be Driven - They fundamentally lose the position of the Chinese nation, believing that everything in the Soviet Union is good. For example, they sing the Soviet national anthem and hang the Soviet flag at meetings.</p>
<p>Communist Party Cadres Realize Their Mistakes, Painfully Correcting Their Past Misdeeds</p>
<p>According to recent news, many enlightened individuals have realized that if they continue like this, it will be detrimental to our nation and people. Therefore, they have realized their mistakes and are correcting their past misdeeds. For example, Lou Ji, the political instructor of the Seventh Company of the Communist Army's Rugao Guard Regiment, is one example. Lou Ji is 24 years old and lives in Tuliu Township, Dingnian District, Rugao County. According to what Mr. Lou himself wrote on July 27th: "When the Japanese devils invaded northern Jiangsu, I lost my chance to study (I was 16 years old then). At 22, I went to teach in southern Rugao. Because that place has very deep red ideas, the main activist was Hu Yunqiu (party name Lin Lin). Due to being tempted for a moment, in the autumn of that year when I was 23 years old, I joined the Communist Party (party name You Xian). Later, I also joined the Seventh Company of the Rugao County Guard Regiment as a special affairs officer. This year, I was promoted to lieutenant instructor, specializing in liking to attack in the dark, attacking small units. If they encounter a large number of troops, they fly away like sparrows (called "sparrow warfare"). The army is divided into field armies and local forces. This area belongs to the Central China Military Region. The commander is Su Yu, and the political commissar is Deng Zihui. There are a total of nine columns, scattered along the Longhai Railway and the Jinpu Railway. The current focus is on the land redistribution movement, allocating one Mu of land to each person, abolishing the Baojia system, and establishing a village and group system completely based on people as a unit, not bound by family, in order to create a society of struggle." Finally, he said: "Only under the leadership of President Chiang can all parties and factions become a strong country. Therefore, he is now willing to sincerely repent, painfully correct his past mistakes, and, under the government's good education, become a good young man again."</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Questions: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) Absolute Sale with Redemption</p>
<p>Zhao Zechang asks: (A) Brothers Jia, Yi, and Bing divided their household early on. After Jia passed away, his son, let's call him someone, was of a corrupt nature. In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he absolutely sold some of his farmland to his uncle Bing. At the time, due to their familial relationship, the price was slightly raised, and it was stated that redemption would never be allowed, with a contract drawn up to that effect. Later, Bing also passed away, and the farmland was divided among his sons and grandsons. Now, this year, farmland prices have soared, and the seller and his son believe there is profit to be made. They are seeking to redeem the land from Bing's sons and grandsons at the original price. Please advise:</p>
<p>(1) Since it was an absolute sale, does the law allow redemption? (2) They claim that there is no absolute sale between relatives. Is there any legal basis for this claim? (3) They are using force to coerce. Can Bing's sons and grandsons file a lawsuit according to law?</p>
<p>(B) Four brothers, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. Jia has two daughters, Yi has one son, Bing has four sons, and Ding has one son. Later, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding all passed away, and their property was divided equally. Because Jia had no son, according to custom, he was succeeded by Bing's son, let's call him someone. Jia's property was given to Bing's son someone alone. Please advise: (1) Is this type of inheritance legal? (2) Jia's daughters are Jia's own children. Do they have any right to inherit? (3) Since Jia's daughters have no property to gain, can they file a lawsuit to recover property from Bing's son someone according to law?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Response] (A) (1) Redemption is not permitted by law. (2) There is no legal basis for this. (3) They may seek redress through legal action.</p>
<p>(B) (1) Inheritance through the ancestral line was abolished with the implementation of the inheritance section of the Civil Code on May 5th, the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. If it was after the aforementioned date, then inheritance by Bing's son has no legal basis. (2) Jia's daughters certainly have the right to inherit. (3) They can sue for recovery on the grounds of infringement of inheritance rights, but they cannot exceed the time limit stipulated in Article 1146, Section 2 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(2) Husband's Affair</p>
<p>Xiujuan asks: (1) I have been married for 30 years and have six children. Now my husband is living with another woman. What crimes have been committed? Can I file a lawsuit according to law? (2) If my husband runs away with another woman, abandoning his family, can I file a lawsuit according to law? (3) If we declare a divorce, who should the children, house, and miscellaneous items belong to? (4) What are the costs if I file a lawsuit? (5) Abortion is not allowed by law, but the woman fears that she will be abandoned by the man later, and they made an agreement. If the woman sues according to the agreement, is it legally valid?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Response] (1) You can sue according to Article 239 of the Criminal Code, provided that the statute of limitations in Article 216 of the Criminal Procedure Law has not passed. (2) You must be able to prove the fact of abandonment. (3) Regarding the custody of children, refer to Articles 1055 and 1051 of the Civil Code. Regarding the house and miscellaneous items, except for the separate property under Article 1013 of the Civil Code, they belong to the husband. (4) Refer to Article 12 of the Civil Procedure Costs Law. (5) If it can be proven that there was coercion, then the man can be exempted from responsibility.</p>
<p>Letters from Readers</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Flees with Goods</h3>
<p>Lost Item, Reward Offered for Return of Goods: To the esteemed readers, I arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th of this month with the intention of taking a boat to the Northeast Railway Reclaimed Area. At around 10:00 AM that morning at the North Station, there were three rickshaws. Two were loaded with luggage, and I rode in one. Unexpectedly, while traveling to the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, due to traffic congestion, the last rickshaw went missing. The rickshaw was carrying two large yellow leather bags and two willow baskets, containing single-layer cotton clothing for men and women, as well as blankets and wool coats, etc. In total, all the clothing for men and women has been lost. I am now stranded in Shanghai and unable to return home. I have long known that your newspaper is enthusiastic about serving the community. I would like to request that you consider my misfortune and publish this in the community service section. I earnestly request that any kind gentlemen who find these items (or if the rickshaw puller's conscience is pricked) deliver the items to my residence, and I will immediately reward them with 400,000 yuan in legal tender. Or, if you find out where the items are hidden and secretly notify me, and I recover the items as a result, I will also reward you with 200,000 yuan in legal tender. I will not break my promise. If you agree, I will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, Li Benxuan, August 17th. (Current residence: Northeast Fellow Townsmen Reception Center, Fuyuan Hall, Meijia Street, Penglai Road, Nanshi)</p>
<h3>Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy in Hebei</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yang Bingsen, Reporting from Baoding on the 11th</p>
<p>The northwestern and southwestern parts of Hebei Province are mountainous, with high terrain, making them good forest areas. The southeastern parts are loess plains, with fertile soil, primarily focused on agricultural production. The region is quite rich. However, due to the devastating wars in recent years and frequent natural disasters, the rural economy has been bankrupted. At a time when agricultural recovery is the current priority, the construction of farmland water conservancy is a prerequisite. Therefore, I am reporting on the agricultural situation in the province for your reference.</p>
<p>(1) RenShou Area Restoration: The RenShou Canal was decided upon for construction in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] by the Hebei Provincial Government in conjunction with the North China Water Conservancy Commission. It draws water from the Hutuo River to irrigate farmland in Lingshou, Zhengding, Xingtang, Xinle, and Huolu counties, totaling approximately 380,000 mu. The Hutuo River Irrigation Project Commission was established, and the project was carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures. By May of the 34th year [1945], the northern section was scheduled for completion, irrigating 137,000 mu of farmland. However, the work was halted by the outbreak of the July 7th Incident [beginning of Second Sino-Japanese War]. The southern section was never started. Now, the entire canal has been almost entirely destroyed and is unusable. It is proposed that the Hebei Provincial Government, in conjunction with the North China Water Conservancy Commission, continue to repair the canal, or cooperate with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to build it using a work-for-relief method. Once this project is completed, the expected benefit is that it can irrigate 380,000 mu of farmland, with an estimated increase of 100 jin per mu, resulting in an annual increase of 38 million jin of agricultural products.</p>
<p>(2) Restoration and Dredging of the Fuyang River Gate: In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the provincial authorities built five gates near Handan on the Fuyang River, controlling the Yongliu Canal in 21 counties, benefiting 134 villages and irrigating 1,500 qing of farmland. Most of it has now been destroyed. The Hebei Provincial Government should not only repair the original gates and canals, but also build new canals. The expected benefit is that it can irrigate 200,000 mu of farmland, with an estimated increase of 100 jin per mu, for a total increase of 20 million jin.</p>
<p>(3) Construction of the Xingzhi Canal and Land Improvement: The canal was built by the Xingzhi Water Conservancy Company, organized by businessman Yu Zengyi in the first year of the Republic [1912], in contract with the provincial government, using water from the Yongding River to irrigate 40 qing of farmland. The provincial government plans to restore the canal to its original state in the near future. As for land improvement, river water has been used in the past to desilt and deposit sediment to improve soil quality, changing some soil into good farmland. For example, the Xiaozhan rice paddies in Tianjin were converted using this method. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese also experimented with this in various coastal areas of eastern Hebei, with significant results. However, after the victory, most of the coastal areas were occupied by the Communist army, and most of the original equipment was destroyed.</p>
<p>Establishment of Water Conservancy Agencies</p>
<p>The Yongding, Daqing, North-South Canal, and Hutuo rivers are the biggest problems in Hebei Province. Even a slight mountain flood or heavy rain can cause flooding, inundating farmland and displacing people. This year, several river embankments were quickly breached by the Communist army, causing artificial floods. After Hebei's recovery, river affairs bureaus were established for each river, specializing in prevention, emergency repairs, embankment construction, and water level checks. In addition, each river bureau plans to be responsible for the construction of water conservancy projects in the future, so that the banks of the rivers will not only be free from floods, but also irrigate the fields on both sides, which will greatly benefit the region.</p>
<p>Ten-Year Well-Drilling Plan</p>
<p>Hebei Province has many plains, which are suitable for cultivation. However, the soil is loose, with a lot of fine sand, which is easily permeable. It is also affected by the continental climate, and rainfall is often insufficient in the spring. In the autumn, there is abundant rainfall with uneven distribution of drought and flood. Therefore, the current work of well digging is a necessary supplement. In the past, well digging in Hebei Province was quietly promoted in Qingyuan, Dingxian, Xinle, Xingtang, Zhengding, Ningjin, Gaoyi, Baixiang, Yaoshan, Neiqiu, Shahe Yongnian counties along the Pinghan Line, Nanpi, Ningjin counties along the Jinpu Line, and Fengrun and Sanhe in eastern Hebei, with good results. Among them, Dingxian has the largest number of wells, with a total of 19,979 wells, followed by Wuji County with 11,983 wells, and Xietai with 6,037 wells. The irrigated land in Dingxian accounts for about 30% of the county, and 70% in Wuji County. But all the wells are old-fashioned, small wells with depths of 5 to 10 meters. Therefore, promoting the digging of new wells is an urgent matter. Hebei Governor Sun also listed the digging of new wells as the central task of this year, and decided to use the following methods: 1. Rotary drilling machine method. 2. Cable tool method. 3. Rock core drilling machine. 4. Manual auger, to be adopted separately. The Hebei Provincial Government also formulated a ten-year well-drilling plan, which will be implemented on schedule. The plan is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Demonstration Phase (Year 35 [1946]) During this phase, a training institution for drilling machine technicians will be established, but it cannot be applied immediately, so large-scale work plans cannot be carried out. Only well digging can be promoted in suitable areas, and trial digging will be carried out in counties with convenient transportation and quiet environments, such as Baoding, Tangshan, and Dadao, as well as cotton-producing counties. If the diameter of each well is 110 meters, and the average flow rate of each well is 3,000 to 1,000 tons per day, it can irrigate 4 to 10 qing of farmland. After this phase is completed, more than 200 qing of farmland can be irrigated at any time, and will no longer be threatened by drought.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Promotion Phase (Year 36 [1947]) During this phase, well-drilling teams will be established, and 500 drilling machines will be purchased and distributed to 15 well-drilling central areas to carry out work. They will be distributed equally according to the cultivated land area of each county. A total of 342 wells will be dug throughout the year, and some wells will also be dug in cotton-producing areas to increase cotton production.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Universal Phase (End of Years 37 [1948] to 39 [1950]) During the first year of this phase, the well-drilling teams will purchase another 500 drilling machines, bringing the total to 1,000. They will continue to work in the 15 areas, digging 6,042 wells with a depth of 80 meters throughout the year. In the second year, 1,000 drilling machines will be purchased, and 12,042 wells will be dug throughout the year. In the third year, another 1,000 drilling machines will be purchased, bringing the total to 3,000. Working at the same depth and speed, 18,042 wells can be dug throughout the year.</p>
<p>Phase 4: Completion Phase (End of Years 40 [1951] to 44 [1955]) With the existing drilling machines, 90,210 wells with a depth of 80 meters can be dug in the five years of this phase. Together with phases 1, 2, and 3, it is possible to complete 129,423 deep wells in the province in ten years. The daily flow rate of each well is 2,000 tons. By the end of Year 44 [1955], 647,115 qing of farmland can be irrigated. However, the cultivatable land in Hebei Province is 866,098 qing. After the completion of this ten-year plan, four-fifths of the province's fertile land will no longer suffer from drought. In addition, embankments will be built along the banks of the rivers to store water, and at the same time, people will be encouraged to build earthen wells or dig springs in areas with shallow water levels, such as the Taihang Mountains, to supplement the lack of well digging. Therefore, the drought disaster in the province can be solved in ten years.</p>
<p>The cost of the ten-year well-drilling program is estimated at US$43,418,070 for machinery in the spring budget of this year. The cost of the well-drilling work team is 1,447,400 yuan (national currency). The amount of loans that the well-drilling work team should give to farmers is 1,873.22.050.200 yuan (national currency). The well-drilling pump is 4,193,305,200,000 yuan (national currency).</p>
<p>Promote Afforestation Movement</p>
<p>The distribution area of natural forests in Hebei has been over-felled and reclaimed for thousands of years, as well as suffering from man-made disasters such as grazing and burning. There are almost no primeval forests left. What exists today are only a few scattered natural forest remnants. According to a survey by the Hebei Provincial Department of Construction, there are: 1. Changli Forest: area of 150,000 mu; 2. Eastern Mausoleums Forest: area of 575,000 mu; 3. Western Mausoleums Forest: area unknown; 4. Western Shunde Forest: area of 7,000 hectares; Forests in Miyun, Xianghe, Wanping, and Fangshan are smaller in area. As for man-made forests, there are: 1. Xishan Afforestation: area of 170,000 mu; 2. Liulihe Dongfang Afforestation; 3. Coastal forest for wind and sand protection in Qinhuangdao; 4. Afforestation near Beidaihe and Luanhe; 5. Afforestation in Eastern and Western Mausoleums. In summary, the area of forest maintenance is 630,307 mu, the area of flood control forest is 257,992 mu, the area of windbreak forest is 383,513 mu, and the area of health forest is 82,420 mu. The forest area is decreasing every day. Therefore, after the enemy surrendered, Hebei Province only worked hard to promote the afforestation movement in the more than 40 counties that were recovered, but the results were minimal. All levels should jointly protect the trees, plant new forests, and mobilize everyone to implement them together in order to develop them. The provincial authorities should also prepare a detailed plan to achieve the goal of greening Hebei.</p>
<p>Locust Plague Numbers are Alarming</p>
<p>Hebei Province has suffered from locust plagues for many years, resulting in huge losses. For example, in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], 124 counties in the province suffered from locusts. At that time, the loss was 45 million yuan. In the 28th year [1939], 29 counties suffered from locusts, with a damage area of 3.9 million mu. At that time, the loss was 7.7 million yuan. In the 29th year [1940], 72 counties suffered from locusts, with a loss of 5 million yuan (the above are statistics from the Hebei Provincial Department of Construction). In early June of this year, locust nymphs were discovered in the Junliangcheng and Yangliuqing areas. The loss of wheat fields in the area was reduced by about 40%. When the writer wrote this manuscript, locusts were also discovered in the suburbs of Baoding. In two days, 500 mu of farmland was lost. Therefore, Hebei Province immediately established a locust control committee to be responsible for handling all locust control matters. The expenses have been determined as 668,400 yuan for the provincial regular expenses, 2,820,000 yuan for the project expenses, 254,000 yuan for the county locust control regular expenses, and 1,310,000 yuan for the project expenses. It is estimated that all 132 counties in the province (currently only 42 counties) will need 206,508,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>In summary, the authorities in Hebei Province are quite determined to build agriculture. Under excellent natural conditions, the failure to promote it smoothly is entirely due to the man-made security situation. Therefore, for the above plans, the reporter sincerely hopes that the government and the people will unite and work hard for the province and the country to truly implement them, so that everyone can share the joy of wealth and abundance!</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions in Yaojiang, Wang Yangming's Hometown</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Reporting from Yuyao on the 18th</p>
<p>On the early morning of the 18th, our group set off towards Yuyao. The verdant fields and distant rolling mountains made people feel relaxed. After passing through several small mountain passes, someone said that this was where bandits used to rob people, but after passing the mountain passes, there was another large area of farmland. I really didn't believe that this was a place where bandits roamed.</p>
<p>Dredging Cao'e River, Repairing Sea Dikes</p>
<p>We arrived at Cao'e Town. Cao'e was a filial daughter from the Han Dynasty. Her father drowned in the river. She cried all night and jumped into the river to look for her father. As a result, Cao'e found her father floating on the water. In the end, both father and daughter died. Later generations changed the name of the Shun River to Cao'e River to commemorate her, and there is Cao'e Town on the bank of the river. We got off the car, crossed the river, and on the other side was Baiguan Town. It is said that King Yu once summoned officials here for a meeting, hence the name. According to the locals, there is also a large Shun Temple here. Shangyu means the legacy of Shun's son. Originally, the Cao'e River was called the Shun River, which was also in memory of Shun. This is already the boundary of Shangyu. Shangyu has 306,709 people, 42 townships, and the entire territory is mostly mountainous. The special products are cotton, glutinous rice, tea, yangmei, and iron sand. According to county government personnel, the most urgent need at present is to dredge the Cao'e River, which can benefit farmland, repair the sea dikes to protect the coastal county, and build a highway from Baiguan to the county seat to facilitate commercial transportation. Now, to get from the county seat of Shangyu to Baiguan, you have to walk dozens of miles of small roads, so it is natural to open this road.</p>
<p>We got in the car and continued forward, and saw a tall mountain far to the right, large, majestic, and lying there. This is Siming Mountain. According to the local people, there are mountains within Siming Mountain, with majestic terrain, which is a place where bandits hide. The unrest in Yuyao, Shangyu, and other places can be said to have started from Siming Mountain.</p>
<p>After traveling 40 kilometers, we arrived at Yuyao. This is the hometown of the famous Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming, and also the hometown of Yan Ziling in the Han Dynasty, and the old home of Mr. Zhu Shunshui and Huang Lizhou of the Yaojiang School in the Ming Dynasty. We saw that Yaodi is indeed a place of beautiful mountains and rivers, with the Yao Ting running through it, and two other rivers embracing each other, with verdant mountains, which is delightful. Inside the county government here, there is a stone tablet erected with the inscription "Hometown of Four Lights." There is also the Fangjie Pavilion, where a "boot" is placed, to commemorate that when Magistrate Wang left the county, the people were reluctant to let him go, so they left a "boot" as a souvenir. There is a plaque placed next to the "boot" with the inscription "The People Cannot Forget," which shows that the people of Yuyao can indeed recognize good officials.</p>
<p>Salt Industry Representatives Go to the Province to Petition</p>
<p>Yuyao is also a cotton-producing area. Although the fiber is not ideal enough, there is still a lot to be done if it is well improved. The most important issue at present is security, because the southern part of the county is one corner of Siming Mountain. Thugs often come in and out, and these thugs incite farmers and gang up to cause trouble. Therefore, to eliminate the bandits in Siming Mountain today, we must start with politics and also with patient persuasion. Another problem is the dispute over the salt farms. Yuyao's salt was originally supplied to the entire province of Zhejiang, and also to the people of several provinces including Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu. The annual output is more than 200 dan. Originally, there were manufacturers who came to buy salt. The manufacturers negotiated with the directors, the directors then negotiated with the pong chiefs, and the pong chiefs then negotiated with the pong households, who were the salt farmers. There was a tacit agreement of preferential treatment between the manufacturers and the directors, but the salt farmers were pitiful, living under exploitation. There are more than 20,000 salt farmers here, and including their families, there are more than 100,000 people in total. Before the war, Yuyao's salt farms had a farm magistrate. Later, through the efforts of the county government personnel, this bad system was improved. The magistrate was changed to a farm manager, and there was no need for the directors to act as intermediaries. The salt farmers sold directly to the salt merchants, but habits are not easy to change overnight. In fact, there are still many difficulties. A year before the Anti-Japanese War, merchants bought salt at a 40% discount, which aroused the opposition of the salt farmers. Later, it was purchased without discount. Today, it is no longer a salt merchant system, but is handled by the Salt Affairs Administration. It is said that recently the Administration is afraid that the purchase price is too high, affecting exports, so it has lowered the purchase price, and the salt farmers demand a price increase because their lives are difficult to maintain. This has been insisted on until now, and has not yet been resolved. The people in the salt industry in the county have sent representatives to petition the Provincial Salt Administration, or even to Nanjing to petition.</p>
<p>The method of making salt here is still the old method from thousands of years ago. The salt tanks are made uneven. After the tide comes, seawater is put in. After the tide recedes, the soil is scraped up, placed on a pile, and water is poured into the salt cave. Then the brine is poured into a jar, taken out later, and placed on a salt slab to let the sun dry and whiten, and then it becomes salt.</p>
<p>The lives of the salt farmers are miserable. They live in thatched huts that are not tall enough, and they eat porridge. If they don't find a way to improve, Yuyao's salt has little hope. We hope that the Salt Administration will not only purchase salt, but also provide technical guidance and improvement, so that the lives of the salt farmers can reach a standard, so that they can be held responsible.</p>
<p>We went to visit Mr. Yangming's former residence. There is only a newly built stone archway of the Earl. The houses have disappeared. Climbing Longquan Mountain, we first arrived at Longquan Temple. This is a building from the first year of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty. The temple is in very good condition, and several nuns manage the temple. Following the small road next to the temple, we climbed up the mountain to Longquan Academy. It is said that Wang Yangming, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou all lectured here, but according to the county chronicle, it was built by Liu Changcheng, the county magistrate during the Qianlong period. There is also a horizontal plaque in front of the academy, but the buildings inside the academy are only remnants, with tiles all over the ground. Recalling the site of the former sages has become a wasteland, which is regrettable. People on the mountain said: "This was destroyed by the enemy." Thinking of the enemy's intentions being so vicious, how can we let them off the hook?</p>
<p>To the right of Longquan Academy is the Xie Gong Shrine, which was the Grand Secretary in the Ming Dynasty, and to the right is the Yan Gong Shrine, where the portrait of Mr. Yan Ziling is sculpted, but the color that was applied is already mottled. Only a few sparse beards remain under Mr. Yan's chin. The shrine door has been destroyed, and only a few women making tinfoil are still making tinfoil, accompanying Mr. Yan's desolate loneliness. A few steps away is Longquan, and the spring water is still clear.</p>
<p>Climbing uphill again through the weeds, we finally saw Yangming Shrine, which was also dilapidated. The stone statue of Mr. Yangming was taken away by the Japanese, and now only the stone table and stone seat remain.</p>
<p>Looking out from the top of Longquan Mountain, Siming Mountain stands in the southwest of Longquan Mountain. Yaojiang is like a belt, and Yuyao County is nestled at the foot of the mountain on both sides. Seeing this river and mountain scenery, we know that talents are emerging, and we hope to build it well to inherit the legacy of the former sages.</p>

<h3>Review: "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm"</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Yue Opera's "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is a historical drama, but I do not wish to prove its historical value. Therefore, I will not comment on whether this play has any historical authenticity. I only want to discuss its performance aspects and whether the actors have portrayed the characters' personalities.</p>
<p>Apart from spoken drama, film, dance, and music, I do not enjoy watching any form of variety drama. However, after arriving in Shanghai, I unexpectedly watched Yue Opera's "Xianglin Sao" and this "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm." Considering the status and position of local opera, I must objectively admit that "Xianglin Sao" was an excellent performance because the content of the play it portrayed was meaningful. However, what is in this "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm"? Does it depict wealthy young men playing with vulnerable young girls? Or does it depict love that cannot be shared, or the thoughts of a jealous woman? If none of these, what else can be said? If "Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is its theme, then the play does not depict why she yearns for the mortal realm, the motivations for "yearning," and her previous state of loneliness. Therefore, we can say: "Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm" is a play without a complete theme.</p>
<p>I find that the set design has improved compared to "Xianglin Sao." In "Xianglin Sao," the set design was inconsistent; here, it is unified. However, unifying the set design does not necessarily mean success, because the atmosphere of each scene is not evident. For example, the second act is meant to depict Yu Xuanji's reception room in the brothel. This scene does not allow us to see that it is a high-class brothel. If we did not read the description, we might easily mistake it for another place. Another example is the fourth act, which is meant to depict Yu Xuanji as a female Taoist, living in the practice room of Xianyi Temple. In the scene, we also cannot see that it is a place of cultivation. If the description stated that this scene was a brothel, it would not be inappropriate! These can be said to be the two most obvious and important environments in the entire play that represent the different identities of the protagonist. But unfortunately, the set designer and director did not pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Actors · Already Stereotyped ·</p>
<p>Yuan Xuefen plays Yu Xuanji. She wrote in the program of "Xianglin Sao" that she only plays a certain type of "woman." That is to say: apart from this type of "woman," all other roles are beyond her ability to play. The so-called personality is non-existent. Therefore, I do not wish to demand much of whether the personality she portrays is authentic and whether it is concretely expressed! However, in the playwright and director Hong Jun's article "How 'Paradise Yearning for the Mortal Realm' Was Written," the personality is written very clearly. He writes: "She has an excessively high ideal, and all her hopes for life are built on this ideal. She underestimates reality, ignores reality, and as a result, reality brings her pain… She has lost the passionate (perhaps a question of 'emotion') and frank heart of a young girl, and replaced it with the cold and perverse nature of a young woman… She does not pursue vanity, she only hopes too much, and never fights against the evil forces of society. She initially ignores them, then avoids them, and eventually becomes eccentric, and finally commits crimes." Although the playwright explained that this is such a personality, I did not see that the actor's acting skills were able to express these personalities in the play. The Yu Xuanji that Yuan Xuefen introduced to us is only a pitiful worm who is deceived and played with! I did not see a trace of the parts of her personality such as ignoring reality, the passion of a young girl, the nature of a young woman, and becoming eccentric. Therefore, if we do not talk about "woman," but talk about personality, then Yuan Xuefen is a complete failure. To put it harshly: Yu Xuanji's achievement is only two or three tenths of Xianglin Sao's. The director also has to take responsibility for this. No matter how popular this actor is, she should be given strict guidance so that she can achieve even more! Because this is not a personal matter, but the glory of the entire Yue Opera community!</p>
<p>The music this time is much better than the soundtrack for "Xianglin Sao." Although it is still so simple and the tunes are inconsistent, it has already complemented the plot, and it is not the chaotic mess it was before.</p>
<p>Many advanced individuals have said it is good, which is encouraging these rising and promising artists from the standpoint of advanced individuals! It is not an expression of satisfaction with these Yue Operas that have not yet caught up with the highest artistic standards!</p>
<h3>Actors and Performances</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Drama is a comprehensive art. Playwrights, directors, set designers, musicians, costume designers, and actors each present their artistic power in the entire performance, so that the art of drama can be further developed and the effect of the drama can be expanded.</p>
<p>However, these participating departments do not appear for personal expression, but for the collective expression of a satisfactory dramatic effect. If any part takes the creative duty for itself, it will harm the creativity of other components, and the drama will lose its fluency, roundness, and freedom; closely related to this, it will lose its persuasiveness to the audience. Each department participating in the artistic process can only engage in creation freely and without restraint within the conditions limited by the rules of dramatic art, and only with the active cooperation of other art departments can the drama obtain a structural harmony and integrity.</p>
<p>If the playwright insists that the script can only be appreciated by silent reading, then the script becomes unstageable and is no different from other literature. If the stage artist expresses "single will," then the drama becomes a picture for people to watch, and the actors become puppets. If the director satisfies "self-ideas" and enforces dictatorship, then the actors become machines, and the drama becomes a tasteless labor. If the star monopolizes the drama, then the other actors are sacrificed, and the audience will not be able to see the entire script in the performance. Therefore, this product of deformed individualism, any part that infringes on the creation of other parts for single self-satisfaction, will cause damage to the entire drama or reduce the artistic level.</p>
<p>But one point should be noted, that in the performance, playwrights, directors, stage designers, musicians, etc. do not directly appeal to the audience, but speak to the audience through the actors. Each technology gives its thoughts to the actors, so that the actors can realize them, otherwise these thoughts will never be alive. The words of the playwright, if the actors do not give them life, do not make them their own language, will still be dead things. A beautiful set placed on the stage, if it has not been touched by the actor's body and senses, will also become lifeless, because it is all given life on the stage, which is dramatic and meaningful. Therefore, a script is different from a poem or a novel, a stage is different from a painting, a stage installation is different from an architectural project, and stage music is not the performance of other music. When each art participates in the creation of drama, it must fall in love with the conditions of drama and perform a dramatic function. In completing this function, each art has a new nature, that is, it has a nature of dramatic purpose, and it must meet the needs of dramatic action, so it is different from their original specialization. Therefore, when each department of the performance participates in the dramatic work, they have to change their original independent faces, and adapt themselves to a department of drama. They not only indirectly express the content, thoughts, and emotions of the drama, but also help the actors' performances, set off the plot, increase the success and effectiveness of the performance, and make the expression of the drama richer, more complete, and more beautiful. They are unified and melted into a whole, which becomes inseparable. Therefore, today's actors can no longer exist independently from other departments of stage art, and they have become an indispensable element in theater art.</p>
<p>The author intends to divide the progress of teaching Kunqu Opera into twelve equal parts according to the different methods of composing music and music scores. Namely, 1. Southern Melody Sanban, 2. Southern Melody One Beat Three Eyes with Gifted Beat, 3. Southern Melody One Beat Three Eyes without Gifted Beat, 4. Southern Melody One Beat One Eye with Gifted Beat, 5. Southern Melody One Beat One Eye without Gifted Beat (the above all include Southern Collected Melodies), 6. Southern Melody Flowing Beat, 7. Northern Melody Sanban, 8. Northern Melody One Beat Three Eyes, 9. Northern Melody One Beat One Eye, 10. Southern Melody Suite, 11. Northern Melody Suite, 12. Combined Southern and Northern Melody Suite.</p>
<p>The above twelve equal parts are the names of the twelve chapters of the book "Kunqu Opera Teaching Manual" planned by the author. Each chapter selects four or five relatively common melodies as examples. Each melody selects at least two or more songs for comparison. For those with the same poetic title and melody title, first record a poem to clarify the differences between the poem and the melody, and the process of entering the melody from the poem, which is one lesson. The lyrics and Gongche notation are the main text. After the main lesson, add notes and explanations on the relevant terms and theories in this lesson, and list several practice questions for practice.</p>
<p>Compiled in this way, the whole book will have about sixty lessons, recording one hundred scattered songs and fifteen complete suites. To get a glimpse of the whole picture of the sea of songs, although it is only a millet in a great warehouse, the format of these hundred songs and fifteen suites should be familiar. As for the method of making the score, each melody records two or more songs, which can be compared and obtained. From this, further step into the second, third, fourth, and even dozens of cycles of study, the scholarship of songs is not difficult to explore.</p>
<p>The first chapter of this book, Southern Melody Sanban, plans to record the melody titles Partridge Sky, Inviting Gold Gate, Recalling the Bridegroom, Red Monk Robe, and Not the Road as examples, divided into five lessons, of which the first three are Southern Song introductions, and the last two are Southern Song interludes. Now the first lesson is prepared as follows:</p>
<p>First record the Song Dynasty famous courtesan Nie Shenghuan's Partridge Sky Farewell Song, and use the "〇" symbol to represent the flat tone, the "×" symbol to represent the oblique tone, the words that should be flat are marked with the "〇" symbol on the left of the word, the words that should be oblique are marked with the "×" symbol, the words that can be flat or oblique are marked with the "×〇" symbol, and the places that should rhyme are marked with rhyme, and the places that do not need to rhyme are marked with sentence. Then record two Partridge Sky songs from the Pipa Record Nanpu fold and the Purple Hairpin Record Yangguan fold and compare them. The Gongche score is noted on the right side of the lyrics, and the four tones of flat, rising, going, and entering are noted on the left side, with the "十" symbol as the Yang tone symbol and the "一" symbol as the Yin tone symbol, such as Yang Ping tone as "十平", Yin Ping tone as "一平", Yang Going tone as "十去", Yin Going tone as "一去", and so on. The sentence rhyme is the same as the poem. However, because the song has filler words and the poem does not, all filler words are written in small letters next to them. The following is an example:</p>
<p>Poem Partridge Sky Farewell 情</p>
<p>Jade pale flowers sad out Fengcheng (rhyme) Lotus Tower under willow green green (rhyme) Before the cup sing Yangguan song (sentence) Farewell to others fifth journey (rhyme)</p>
<p>Looking for good dream (sentence) Dream hard to come true (rhyme) Someone</p>
<p>Who knows my feelings at this time (rhyme) Tears before pillow rain before steps (sentence) Separated by a window dripping until dawn (rhyme)</p>
<p>From Partridge Sky one, Nanpu</p>
<p>Only fear ten thousand miles of mountains and rivers ten thousand miles of sorrow (rhyme) The same thoughts the same worries (rhyme) Mulberry Elm twilight should be difficult to protect (sentence) How can the guest house scenery stay for a long time (rhyme) There (sentence) Slowly concentrate (rhyme) Just as the horse walks ten steps nine times turning head (rhyme) Returning home only afraid of hurting relatives' intentions (sentence) Holding back tears vaguely dare not flow (rhyme)</p>
<p>Song Partridge Sky two, Yangguan</p>
<p>Cover the remnant tears send you on the seven fragrant car (rhyme) Guarding the dream of husband and wife jasper dwelling (rhyme) Wishing you to ennoble tour painted brocade (sentence) May I be chirping birds falling flowers beginning (rhyme) The dry riders hold (sentence) Ten thousand people support (rhyme) Rich and noble heroes beautiful husbands (rhyme) Teach him to close the river everywhere to rest the enemy sword (sentence) Post road meet people number send book (rhyme)</p>
<p>From the above popular poem and two songs, comparing and observing, the similarities and differences between the poem and the song rhythm can be seen. Partridge Sky is composed of two seven-character quatrains, only the first seven-character sentence of the second quatrain is split into two sentences of three characters each of flat oblique oblique and oblique flat flat, which is the same for both the poem and the song. The song can add filler words but the poem cannot, which is the first difference. The song is still true and straightforward, and is known for its original language, while the poem emphasizes rhetoric, which is the second difference. The poem is the author's work to express personal emotions, while the song speaks for the characters in the play, which is the third difference. Although this is the most initial, most superficial, and most obvious understanding, by reading more works by famous people, you can try to compose music.</p>
<h3>Dog Star Lassie Travels Thousands of Miles to Find Young Master</h3>
<p>— Yin Huai</p>
<p>In the county of 克郡, England, there was a child who had a beautiful dog named Lassie. They depended on each other and were as close as siblings. Every day at four o'clock in the afternoon, when the child was dismissed from school, Lassie would instinctively go to pick him up and bring him home. However, one day, due to unemployment and poverty, the owner sold it to the Duke. What it encountered was no longer warmth and love, but iron cages, iron chains, and brutality.</p>
<p>It struggled to escape, once, twice. Finally, although it was taken to Scotland, it finally broke free from the clutches of the Duke's servants. For the sake of its old master's attachment, it did not care how far the distance of more than a hundred miles was, and drove towards its hometown. This was a difficult journey, wading through towering mountains and rapid rivers. Thunderstorms, thugs' hunting, dog catchers' chasing... it ignored everything and just moved towards its hometown.</p>
<p>Finally, at four o'clock in the afternoon one day, dragging its lame front foot and tired, dirty body, it returned to the old place under the shade of the school tree, waiting for its young master who greeted it with tears.</p>
<p>This is really a touching film. What the child gave was friendship and warmth, and what Lassie repaid was loyalty. You see, as long as it has one breath left, this ambition will not change. What kind of difficulties can stop it, and what kind of petty favor can stop it along the way. The center of gravity of the entire play is concentrated on Lassie, the dog star. It is indeed very good at acting. It performs disappointment, fatigue, dying, serious injury, and other postures naturally and realistically, like a great actor.</p>
<p>The pictures are extremely beautiful. The quiet English countryside, thunderstorms, sunrises, waterfalls... add a lot of poetic and artistic flavor to the whole film, adding emotion.</p>
<p>United Artists Film Company's authority film "The Sword Man of Troubled Times" is Little Fan Pengke's proud masterpiece. One person plays two roles, and appearing swords in the same shot at the same time is an unprecedented spectacle on the screen. The plot of the whole film is enthusiastic and compact, and the past martial arts films that have been shown cannot compare to it. The film is scheduled to be shown simultaneously at Hu Guang Xin Guang on August 27.</p>
<h3>Current Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Qian Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I talked to a theater friend about the phenomenon of spoken drama. Everyone felt that the crisis of spoken drama had really come. Because every performance is shouting about losing money, and because of losing money, it is impossible to make spoken drama performances anymore. Therefore, it affects the survival of spoken drama.</p>
<p>As long as we open the newspaper to take a look, there are more than a hundred theater groups in Shanghai. Only a little less than one-tenth of these hundred theater groups are spoken drama groups, and the others are just Shanghai Opera, Yue Opera, National Opera, and some are even things like滑稽戏and 摊簧. Then, why is it only spoken drama that loses money? Why can other inferior theater groups stand up instead? The reason is very simple, because they are just playing with the audience, catering to the audience, or peddling sex and low-level interests, making it easy for ordinary citizens to be intoxicated in their boring interests. And what about spoken drama? It is a serious, high-level, in-depth, and truly artistic work that walks in front of the times, and the ticket price is relatively high. Ordinary citizens cannot easily accept its art, nor can they afford tickets to enter the venue. Therefore, every performance of it will lose money.</p>
<p>That friend said: Shanghai theater friends choose a script, the first step is to see if there is a business eye. And the first eye of the theater friends from Chongqing when choosing a script is to ask if the consciousness is correct. There is a difference here, so Shanghai friends can earn gold bars by playing Autumn Wind Opera, while most of the theater groups from Chongqing lose money. I don't know if this is reliable, but I think the reason is not starting after the victory. As early as under the control of the enemy and the puppet regime, these theater friends had to do so, otherwise, the Japanese would invite them to jail. It is said that the performance of "Metamorphosis" was ordered to stop. Over time, spoken drama audiences have been cultivated to only seek eye comfort, regardless of whether their brains are empty. Therefore, there is such a crisis in performing drama in Shanghai now. Some spoken drama audiences in the era of enemy and puppet regime cannot accept the current drama performances with profound consciousness, and have changed their style and ran to the cinema to watch American movies. Some audiences who are not interested in foreign films and have a lower level have also run into the Yue Opera and 滑稽戏 venues. The number of audiences in the spoken drama venue has decreased!</p>
<p>Although spoken drama is so depressed, we these spoken drama workers, except for a few, still do not want to change our style and make performances that lower the standard!</p>
<p>The pieces that are particularly good are still few, and there are none that can surpass "A Dog's Devotion."</p>
<p>Judging from the director of 滑稽戏 films, this film is well-chosen, but the actors are not exciting. Abbott is tough, and Costello is still the same old thing, but the jokes happen naturally. When the two eat a snack together, Costello's first order is very good, but the next few times are a bit superfluous. The news film "World's Largest Engine Airplane" shown before the film is very good.</p>
<p>Liu Bie has not shown any characteristics in this film, and the colors are also very ordinary. The scene of the opening Hades is indeed very good in color, and Tang Yamanchi coming from afar is not bad. However, it is better not to shoot the "King of Hell" head-on, because taking more back shots can achieve a greater effect.</p>
<p>The female role, Queen Thani, performed better than Tang Yamanchi, and grandfather却尔斯可本was very good.</p>
<p>Although the director pressed the atmosphere of the whole film too heavily, the handling was not bad. John Garfield's self-talk in the train window is also very novel, but no very prominent points were found.</p>
<p>The actors in the whole film are all trying their best, and John Garfield has many facial close-ups, which are still competent. Marlene Ola is more successful than "Blood Sea Contending Heroes", and 탈스 리査 is also quite good.</p>
<p>The shortcoming of the whole film is that because the director presses the play very heavily everywhere, it lacks the characteristics of ups and downs. The screenwriter's clues are lacking in strength.</p>
<p>却尔斯劳顿 did not achieve much in this film, that is because the director could not provoke 却尔斯劳顿. The whole film should have a lot of inner drama to watch, but as a result, very little was seen. Both the screenwriter and the director failed, only the last scene of surrendering in front was photographed well, and the subtitles of his film came from this transformation, so it is not bad.</p>
<p>Bai Beilan Stanfei is another style in this film, and the performance is not bad, it is indeed an old qualification. The scene of talking with Michael Xia next to the wine cabinet is brilliantly performed. The clues of the whole play are still not strict, and the director's techniques are also lacking in change. Michael Xia did not succeed.</p>
<p>However, from this film, we can see that the "low level" on the American drama scene is not inferior to our "civilized play."</p>
<p>The best actors:</p>
<p>(1)却尔斯劳顿, in "Killing Wife News"</p>
<p>(2)白蓓兰史丹妃, in "Theatrical Gossip"</p>
<p>(3)约瀚迦飞尔, in "Deep Abyss"</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Record of Zhang Dinghe's Concert</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The Zhang family is a family of literature and art enthusiasts. Their ancestor, Zhang Shusheng of Hefei, was a high-ranking official in the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, they are a so-called scholarly family, with a tradition of intellectual talent according to genetics. There are four elder sisters in the family: Yuanhe, Yunhe, Zhaohe, and Chonghe; and six younger brothers: Zonghe, Yinhe, Dinghe, Yuhe, Huanhe, and Ninghe. The sisters all have two-legged names, and the brothers all have "bao gai tou" (radical signifying "roof") names. During the Anti-Japanese War, the siblings moved around to various places, but still compiled and copied publications, taking turns mailing them. I worked with Zonghe at Lihuang Anhui College for a year and a half, and saw their family publication "Water." It contained poems written by the second sister, who suffered from homesickness and used it as the theme. Shen Congwen, the husband of the third sister, and his child Huchu also had major works in it. At the end of the book, there were rules: 1. Whoever receives the publication must attach their recent work to it; 2. After the publication arrives, please send it to someone within a week. This was indeed very interesting. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the siblings have all come to Shanghai and held a banquet for the ten siblings. Because I had been a teacher of Zhaohe and Zonghe (teaching them the principles of the novel and modern world literature at China Public School), and I was also a music friend or member of the Rainbow Society with Yuanhe, Yunhe, and Chonghe, I had close relationships and was also invited to join. Dinghe even took several photos.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Dinghe held a song concert at Yiyuan, inviting his friends to listen to the music. Zonghe had long told me that his younger brother Dinghe was very famous for composing songs in the rear. At first, he only liked Western music, but later he actually came to like Kunqu Opera, feeling that Kunqu Opera also had its merits. Zonghe, who is currently the principal of Suzhou Leyi Girls' Middle School, also rushed to attend the concert. The eldest Chonghe is still in Suzhou. She has a great understanding of Kunqu Opera music theory and is rare among female Kunqu Opera enthusiasts. Her performances of "The Interrupted Dream" and "The Complaint with Incense" are both excellent. When she was in Chongqing, she performed "School" and "Garden Stroll" in a charity performance to raise funds for the National Compilation and Translation Bureau.</p>
<p>My wife and I went together and saw that Zheng Zhenduo, Li Jianwu, Xu Diaofu, Wu Zuguang, Ding Cong, Li Yifengzi, and others had arrived. Shen Congwen and Zhaohe stood on the spectator's platform, saying they were learning to be hosts.</p>
<p>The drama interludes sung that night included: Guo Moruo's "The Flowers of the Tangdi," Tian Han's "Resurrection," Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Righteousness" and "Phoenix City," Xian Yiqiao's "Yue Fei," Ostrovsky's "The Thunderstorm," and a certain Mr.'s "Great Qian Mountain." Among them, I liked Tian Han's lyrics the most. The lyrics for "Great Qian Mountain" were written by Yunhe, "The water of Chaohu Lake is clear, the peach town is red with blood flowers." She probably suffered from homesickness again in Chongqing. Wu Zuguang's "Ode to Righteousness" uses the words of Niu Xiji's "Sheng Zhazi."</p>
<p>I am completely an amateur when it comes to music. Congwen said that Dinghe is a music enthusiast, and I believe that someone who is enthusiastic must be skilled. Songs like "Please Don't Act So Soon," "Late Spring at Hou Lake," "Ode to the Artistic Trenches," and "Great Qian Mountain Chorus" all sounded very good. "The Good Old Days of Jiangnan" depicted the transition from joy to anger, and "Homecoming Journey" depicted a happy situation, all of which can be expressed through musical scores.</p>
<p>I have three hopes for Dinghe: First, create instrumental pieces that are not limited by the singer's intonation and wording. Second, compose more musical pieces that express "the expression of power," showing masculine beauty. Third, next time you hold a concert, the number of choir members must be increased as much as possible; two or three people seem too monotonous.</p>
<p>The poems and lyrics sung this time included Yue Fei's Manjianghong and the new poet Chen Mengjia's "Swallow." Qian Feng's prose poem "Mother's Heart" is a very good satire for those who "forget their mother after having a wife," and the concept is also clever.</p>
<p>I think the tenor Zhu Chongmao sang very well. The soprano Zeng Xianen also sang not badly, but it seemed not bright enough, perhaps limited by the score. Chongmao changed "time" (時光) to "time" (時間), which rhymes with "later" (晚一點). I don't know if this song "Please Don't Act So Soon" is entirely rhymed with Jiangyang.</p>
<p>Huanhe, Yuhe, and Yunhe all wrote lyrics, while Yuanhe, Zhaohe, Zonghe, and others served as hosts. It can be said that all ten Zhang siblings were mobilized.</p>
<p>After performing for a large part of the evening, Lü En also rushed to listen. Recently, Lü En, in Nanjing, for Zhou Yan's (He Mengfu's revised) "The Peach Blossom Fan," which contains two songs from The Peony Pavilion "Garden Stroll" (first singing "Good Sister," then singing "Zao Luo Pao"), had invited Pu Xiyuan to teach these two pieces. It is said that when this play was staged in Chongqing, Yunhe would go every night to sing, and Ding Cong would play the flute; this reminds me of an art appreciation meeting of the Literary and Art Association, where Ding Cong played Garden Stroll for me, and after finishing, bowed with a smile and went off the stage, that expression was very innocent and interesting.</p>
<h3>Night on the Jialing River – Jialing River Ballad No. 2</h3>
<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>At night, the sound of the Jialing River becomes more mournful. The gloomy sound of the waves echoes with a sob, like a resentful woman in the deep boudoir, sighing softly towards the starry night sky and the bright moon. Like a young woman missing her husband, weeping softly on a stormy night.</p>
<p>At night, the lights on both banks of the Jialing River are like scattered stars in the night sky, scattered on the mountain peaks and water banks. From the river bay, several fishing lights shimmer. The quietness of the night brings tranquility to the fishermen, reducing the fatigue of the whole day with a comfortable rest.</p>
<p>When the footprints of night have covered the Jialing River, the small town on the banks of the Jialing River begins to sink into the stillness of the air. The doors of the small shops begin to close. The night wind blows out the lights in the town, blowing the noisy human voices of the day towards the valleys of the mountains and the banks of the water, leaving only desolation and loneliness to this small town on the river bank.</p>
<p>In the shelter of the eaves, one or two beggars lie sprawled, with a pile of messy straw and a few pieces of torn cotton wool forming their resting place. Sometimes, they turn over, uttering a pleading delirium.</p>
<p>On the quiet roads, wild dogs run in packs. Sometimes, they bark at the distant lights, sometimes they bite and pounce on each other to compete for a dry bone or a piece of smelly sheepskin, and sometimes they happily run towards the desolate ancient tomb area, running towards the depths of the low forest.</p>
<p>The watchman, like a national spirit, carries a small paper lantern and strolls out from the deep alleys, knocking the short wooden stick on the bamboo clapper, reporting a not very accurate time as he walks from one end of the street to the other. A pair of broken shoes without heels patter...patter on the cobblestones, echoing the chirping of insects.</p>
<p>The night is deep, the sound of the Jialing River becomes more gloomy, the small town on the banks of the Jialing River becomes more desolate, the people have all gone to sleep, only a few drunken men returning home and some people strolling on the road are still pacing on this desolate street.</p>
<p>Beside the street, one or two hunched-over old people selling stir-fried rice candy and boiled water are slowly walking along the street. Sometimes, they also put down the large iron pot full of boiled water and the old bamboo basket containing bowls, utensils, and stir-fried rice candy, and sit on the cobblestones, burying their heads and vigorously fanning the charcoal fire under the pot. When a dark shadow appears on the road, he raises his voice and shouts "Stir-fried rice candy... boiled... water..." until the dark shadow has disappeared around the corner of the house, he disappointedly hangs his head, looks at the charcoal fire under the pot, and then picks up the water pot and the bamboo basket and walks to another place.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, the breeze is blowing through my window. In this desolate small town on the banks of the Jialing River, the sound of stir-fried rice candy and boiled water is still echoing, walking from one end of the street to the other, and slowly walking over from the distance again. The shrill cry is like the cold wind sweeping the withered leaves of late autumn, and also brushing past the gaunt treetops, desolate, miserable, like someone calling out and weeping in the desolate small town in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The day is about to dawn, and travelers begin to appear on the road. Those selling boiled eggs and soybean milk and fried dough sticks also set up wooden stands on the side of the street, inviting travelers with friendly voices.</p>
<p>The Jialing River gradually awakens in the sunlight, and the small town on the banks of the Jialing River gradually becomes active and noisy. This noisy sound, this rushing water of the Jialing River, is slowly brewing, slowly creating, another mournful and tragic night for the Jialing.</p>
<h3>Spring Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Xiao Fu</p>
<p>The grey and ancient small town exposes the scars of artillery fire, like a paralyzed patient baring his body afflicted with hateful scabies; the phoenix's rebirth is ultimately a beautiful myth, no buildings were built on the ruins, but were covered by barren wormwood and muddy moss. The old and weak people, with sickly complexions and tattered clothes, gasp in the lingering fear of bayonets and the suffering of poverty. "Daybreak" is only a vague hope, gradually diminishing is a brief spring dream of restoring the old life.</p>
<p>Along the way, old women pointed at me behind my back, whispering, clearly talking about my return. Neighbors greeted me with surprise, calculating the years I had been away from home, causing pointless disputes; they asked about my wife, asked how many children I had, saying I was lucky, lamenting that my mother had already passed away, and her regret of not being able to hold her grandson. I thanked them for their concern, but I was not happy at all. What they were overflowing with was sympathy that didn't hit the mark. They had no idea how heavy a burden I was carrying on my shoulders, how long I had carried it, and that I still couldn't rest and catch my breath. I was immersed in memories, when I was so young, so full of life like a newborn calf; but chewing on the bitter juice of life, I gradually felt my own fatigue and old age. I almost saw their warm solicitude as greasy flattery. Answering their questions briefly, I hurried away.</p>
<p>When I saw the mottled garden wall and the dilapidated gate from afar, I was slightly attacked by a childhood memory: once a year, in the height of summer, the doors and windows would be painted brightly, as if to maintain the reputation of a family, while tirelessly embellishing its appearance; at this time, my younger siblings and I would often be happy to share a little light work, dipping broken brushes in tung oil and painting the bamboo bars of the oyster shell window sashes. But after these long years, they have been eroded and decayed by wind and frost, doesn't it just reflect the rise and fall of my family's fortunes, and the joys and sorrows of everyone's life under this roof. Even if one day I can redecorate this lintel, where can I find the lost joy of childhood?</p>
<p>My father's teeth were more gapped, his back more hunched, his emaciated appearance had changed so drastically, that there was a huge difference from the impression in my memory. Impressions are often static, children seem to be children forever, and the elderly also seem to be as old as they were in the past, making us almost dare not believe it when we reunite after a long absence: "Ah! You've aged a lot!" I have been played by the ruthlessness of time. Thirty years of a teacher's life, he has blurred his eyes with lesson papers, exhausted his mind, and worn through the sleeves of how many clothes at his desk!</p>
<p>"You're back, good, you're finally back!" He was relaxed and happy as if he had put down a heavy burden. He asked about my wife and children, inquiring about the safety of our journey. He told me that Uncle Yun had performed divination for our safety, saying there were risks on the way; Uncle Yun asked how to resolve this fated disaster, and the spirit pointed out three words: Be Sincere to Buddha. Father was not a follower of Han Changli, so he recited Amitabha Buddha dozens of times a day. Now that he heard that the ship we were on encountered wind and waves in the Yangtze River, so it was anchored near Madang for a whole day, he said with awareness and relief: "Yes, yes; you can't completely believe it, but you can't not believe it. Reciting Buddha doesn't hurt anything, a gentleman asks about disaster but not about fortune."</p>
<p>The next day was the clan's spring sacrifice; this time I planned to stay for only a few days after returning home, so I might as well take this opportunity to see the clansmen, saving myself the trouble of visiting each family. I happened to be catching up unintentionally.</p>
<p>The ancestral hall was in a remote place in the corner of the city, and had been in disrepair for years, so dilapidated that it could not keep out the wind and rain. The doors and windows had long been dismantled by the garrison and refugees to cook, leaving it open and empty, like an old man with missing teeth, grotesquely opening his haggard mouth. The courtyard was overgrown with weeds, and the old warden also had no intention of hoeing, covering it with rainwater, wetting people's clothes and shoes. Clansmen arrived one after another with umbrellas. I don't know the situation of the spring and autumn rain sacrifices during these years of war, but it was so desolate and lonely compared to before the war. It seems that most people came to make an appearance, to get a tasty meal in these months of not knowing the taste of meat. The clan chief, my great uncle, was still decently dressed, and rigidly took out his recent draft of poems for people to appreciate. One couplet in the poem used green against red sheep, which shows that he could still drink a cup of fine wine every day in the years of war and chaos, and his later years were relatively comfortable. Father and two or three uncles were dressed somewhat shabbily, and the rest could simply be said to be in tatters. One of my cousins was wearing a short, narrow long gown, full of grease and patches. I asked him what he had been doing lately, and he said with a blush and an apology: "It's nothing to talk about, nothing to talk about!" Someone told me behind my back that this cousin had mostly been living by selling clothes for the past few years. Thinking that he couldn't pick out a suitable and presentable piece of clothing for himself from the many clothes that passed through his hands, it can be seen how humble his industry and how bitter his days were. So few clansmen arrived, perhaps some were running around in foreign lands to find clothes and food; some who stayed at home were also ashamed of their poverty, and even the temptation of a meal of wine and food could not dispel his self-esteem that was timid to see people, and he would rather hide in his house chewing vegetable roots and thin porridge?</p>
<p>The sacrificial ceremony began. The officiant chanted three offerings of wine and incense according to custom, their voices were so weak and mournful. The people kneeling and worshiping in turn by generation, hastily and quickly kowtowed, everyone was without a trace of piety and solemnity. Human affection is as thin as paper, even descendants towards their ancestors are still like this; generally, only when days are warm and well-fed can people think of the difficulties of their predecessors in starting a business, and be grateful and pious to them; now, facing these ten-odd plaques that indicate "Jieyuan," "Mingjing," and "Bagong," mottled and dusty, covered with spider webs, the descendants' little filial piety for remembering their ancestors has long vanished.</p>
<p>The dishes were so simple, and the wine was so weak; but everyone praised the clan chief for handling affairs so seriously; because the ancestral hall's fields were pitifully small, in today's world of rice like pearls and firewood like cassia, it almost cost money to set up three tables of wine and food. During the banquet, someone talked about what family was holding a funeral, and an ordinary coffin cost tens of millions of new tickets, saying that if the elderly happened to die in this year, it was simply making things difficult for their children and daughters-in-law. Although this was a cynical joke, the expressions of agreement in the nods of many people almost revealed their feelings of worry for their aging parents, and regretted missing the happiness of being an unfilial mourner in the peaceful years of the past.</p>
<p>These many years of war and struggle have accelerated the decline of this class represented by my clan. This pathetic and laughable quasi-gentry class, used to study painting for a few years, recognize a few words and write literary compositions, teach in private schools, and be idle guests in government offices. Once in an era of great turmoil, if they can't climb up to become small politicians who stir up trouble and fish in troubled waters, they will fall into the trap of poverty, floating and sinking in the storms like a piece of broken ship plank. They can't carry on their shoulders, they can't lift with their hands, they are deeply poisoned by a long gown, and they stubbornly cling to not taking off this long gown, as if a lotus gentleman on the verge of bankruptcy lacks the determination and courage to quit his opium addiction to the death.</p>
<p>Those who cannot carry the burden of the times will inevitably be thrown aside by ruthless fate, collapsing and rolling in the ditches, weakly looking at the dust raised by the gradually receding rows. I suddenly became alarmed, whether I, who grew up in this class, had resolutely shed that spiritual long gown, escaped from this class, and had the strength to carry on this burden of duty and continue walking?</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng13</p>
<p>"Your grandpa is just teasing you."</p>
<p>"Really, that's how he talks to everyone. If you're free, chat with him a bit, you'll definitely hear it."</p>
<p>"You're only thirteen years old this year, did you start practicing martial arts as soon as you hit the ground?" Feeling amused, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Who says I didn't?" This kid definitely has a genuine Northeastern accent, starting every sentence with a question.</p>
<p>"Sigh…? An outsider would never believe that."</p>
<p>"Before, my dad had a fight with someone and had an arm broken; Mom went to get revenge, but she got beaten too. Out of spite, my grandpa practiced some kind of leg technique that could break people's chi. Grandpa is my own grandpa's martial brother. Grandpa said my mom was too old to practice. That's a unique skill, if you're over fifteen, you definitely can't learn it. My mom was eighteen, and she got married, so it wasn't possible." He didn't continue, looking like his mind had already wandered off to something else.</p>
<p>"And then?" I prompted him.</p>
<p>"And then… and then…" Maybe he was considering how to continue.</p>
<p>"And then you came along, didn't you?" I connected the story for him.</p>
<p>"That's right…" As if he had overcome a difficult obstacle, "That's right… but I wasn't even born yet, you know?"</p>
<p>"I understand." I told him very seriously.</p>
<p>"Grandpa knew about this, and said 'Alright, this time we can practice.' From that day on, we started practicing – but not for Mom to practice, for me to practice, Grandpa said…" He turned his head, his eyes darting around, wanting to see if I really understood what he was saying.</p>
<p>This time I really understood. He was probably practicing so-called "prenatal education." I was willing to listen to this legend.</p>
<p>"Grandpa had people draw a lot of Buddha images, one image for each kung fu stance, together, a set of 'Bodhidharma Practice Chart.'" Grandpa mimed a stance, and had someone draw a picture based on that stance, once it was drawn, he hung it all over a room, and had Mom look at it, she had to look at it several times a day. Just look, don't move. He also taught Mom to practice breathing exercises; before dawn, she had to sit in the courtyard and practice breathing exercises. She also had to take medicine, called 'Replenishing Congenital' pills."</p>
<p>"Once the stances were familiar, Grandpa practiced for Mom to watch, telling Mom to think about practicing, but not to move. After thinking about it, she would stroll in the courtyard, practicing three or four times a day, in less than a month, Mom knew everything, and Grandpa would ask Mom questions. If Mom couldn't answer, Grandpa would mime for Mom to watch. Grandpa said they were all boxing manuals, with a hundred ways to…."</p>
<p>"In the days leading up to 'giving birth,' Mom started worrying, 'afraid of having a girl,' Mom kept muttering. Grandpa said he actually liked girls, if it was a girl, Grandpa would teach her Iron Palm, seventy-two stances of Skirt-Hidden Legs, Congenital One…" He paused. "Definitely get revenge."</p>

<h3>To a Friend</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>I am wearing a pure white silk robe, long and trailing on the ground. The ground is covered with white blossoms. A shimmering light shoots up, onto my chest, my shoulders, my head. Ah! On my chest, I wear a small golden sun. On my shoulders, I drape a Taoist robe trimmed with gold. On my head, I wear a large hat inlaid with golden stars. I am solemn, my eyes looking at my nose. I seem to be in deep thought, as if silently praying. Step by step, I walk very slowly, to a high platform. At the very center of the platform hangs a huge, unparalleled sun. On the platform, there is a golden incense burner. Blazing flames leap from the incense burner, and the flames exhale a dense fragrance. I stand upright in solemn silence, pressing my palms together. Enveloped in the swirling flames and fragrance, I seem to have arrived before God. Toward the blazing flames and the high-hanging sun, I reverently bow down, bow down, bow down again – at this moment, the audience below sings out, "Bravo! Bravo!"</p>
<p>The name of the play was "The Lost Star." It was performed at a Christmas celebration in our girls' school more than ten years ago. In that play, I played a young doctor, more or less the main character, I think? I don't remember clearly. But I remember that a few days after the play, an elder wrote me a letter containing this sentence:</p>
<p>"You acted very well in the play. Your play is not over. I hope you will always continue to perform with such reverence and earnestness!"</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>At that time, I was too young to understand what this meant. But later, I suddenly understood. I don't need to tell you how I came to understand it. But I want to tell you that it is because I understood this sentence that I have been able to remain in this suffering world to this day, more than ten years later.</p>
<p>Now I want to say something else to you.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, on such a hot and humid afternoon, your letter suddenly arrived. Every time I see your letter, I am always happy, always excited, always as if I see a tall figure, wearing a pure white silk robe, draped with a Taoist robe trimmed with gold, wearing a large hat with golden stars, standing before a platform wreathed in incense, reverently bowing down, bowing down, bowing down again!...</p>
<p>However, this time, after reading your letter, my hand suddenly trembled.</p>
<p>I am not surprised that you said, "I really want to leave Shanghai," nor am I surprised that you said, "My heart is even more uneasy than during wartime." But I am surprised by this sentence you said: "I am cynical about everyone and everything!"...</p>
<p>"Cynical!"...</p>
<p>Ah! More than surprised, more than alarmed! More than worried!...</p>
<p>Ah, my friend, are you joking with me?...</p>
<p>Not your elder, not your confidant, just a loyal reader of yours, a friend whom you have never met, today wishes to solemnly return this precious sentence to you:</p>
<p>"You acted very well in the play. Your play is not over. May you always continue to perform with such reverence and earnestness!"</p>

<h3>Ramblings by a Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 19th mentioned that two female reporters from China were very active at the Peace Conference, one being Ding Qinglu and the other Xu Zongbai, both of which are actually mistranslations. Liao Qinglu is a mistake for Lu Jingqing, and Xu Zongbai is a mistake for Xu Zhongpei.</p>
<p>Lu Jingqing, pen name Xiao Lu, is the wife of the late Councilor Yu Lixi and is one of the most prominent female writers in China, on par with Xie Bingxin, Huang Luyin, and Chen Xuezhao.</p>
<p>Both Lu and Xu are of short stature, weighing less than a hundred pounds, which is why they likely attracted special attention at the Peace Conference.</p>
<p>September 1st is Journalist's Day, but newspapers are not suspending publication for a day because of it, so doing our line of work is more difficult than any other. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, the more it is some kind of commemorative holiday, the more tense and busy we are. Contrasting this with the ease and leisure of others, we feel even worse.</p>
<p>Not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but that so-called "uncrowned king" hat is both laughable and tearful.</p>
<p>A visitor from Chengdu says that when Sichuan University, Chongqing University, and other schools in Chengdu held entrance exams, some people raised millions of dollars and colluded with the workers of the examination committee to steal the exam questions, forming a "lecture committee" to peddle them to the test-takers, each question priced at two thousand five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>These business acumen, professors or examination committee members did not think of. No wonder some merchants would scold scholars as after all they are scholars, even if the God of Wealth comes, they would not know how to open the door!</p>
<p>The autumn wind has risen, and the signs of autumn are gradually appearing. Looking back on the rampage of cholera this summer, we can count ourselves lucky that not many people died. May those who have survived the jaws of death take extra care at this time, because at this juncture, all the grievances, large and small, lurking within the body are waiting to settle accounts with you.</p>
<h3>A Difference of One Word</h3>
<p>— Erjie</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union have vastly different interpretations of the Yalta Agreement. In the past, when the Japanese cabinet was amending the constitution, Shidehara insisted that it was not necessary to amend it, but only to add a new interpretation. The same words can have marvelous effects when interpreted differently, which is why Confucius was extremely careful in his praise and criticism in the Spring and Autumn Annals, because a slight carelessness could not only fail to criticize him properly, but also risk being used as a shield.</p>
<p>We often see the sentence "all property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses of the family" attached to reports of the sentencing of traitors after conviction. This word "酌" [zhuó, "discretionary"] is endlessly wonderful. "酌" means considering the circumstances, relying entirely on human sentiment, with no rigid regulations. Does the so-called necessary living expenses of the family only cover the cost of plain clothes and simple tea, or does it also require expenses for dancing and automobiles in addition to large dishes and western-style houses? If the law has no explicit provisions, everyone can manipulate it.</p>
<p>Speaking of examples, since Li Ze was sentenced, the authorities seem to have taken a lenient attitude and have not taken any action or confiscated Li Ze's property, presumably based on the "酌" in "酌留" [zhuóliú, "discretionary reservation"]. And the New New Company is probably saying that Li Ze's property is not enough for his family's necessary living expenses, so "still paying more than three million yuan per month" can also be said to be handled with discretion. Judging from this case, one can infer the rest, but they can shamelessly say that it is "handled according to law," isn't it wonderful!</p>
<p>The main text of the court's judgment should be a rigid regulation, which is unnecessary to say. When we sentence criminals to imprisonment, we do not say that we will "酌判" [zhuó pàn, "discretionarily sentence"] them to several years, but we must state the number of years and months. However, when dealing with the property of traitors, we insist on using the word "酌" [zhuó, "discretion"], is it because we do not want to lose the "principle of loyalty and forgiveness"? We cannot but feel regret about this!</p>
<p>The Dagong Bao reported on the 19th that the Ministry of Justice and Administration will soon have regulations on the matter of discretionary retention of family living expenses. We hope that this "soon" will not be delayed too long, and what will happen to these traitorous masters who have already been granted "discretionary retention" after the regulations are made in the future? Will they still be treated with "leniency"? The writer can only sell this out. "Dear readers, let's see the next chapter for the analysis."</p>

In addition, people in Guangxi are going to the mountains in groups to dig up wild arrowhead, wild, fern roots, and Guanzhong flour to fill their stomachs. These must also be delicious delicacies. Some people in Hubei are eating duckweed and swallowing chaff, which are naturally also two famous delicacies. These are all the latest foods that can be enjoyed by the Shanghai oldies.</p>
<p>People of Shanghai, do you know what those foods taste like?</p>
<h3>Do a Good Deed Every Day</h3>
<p>— Zhongbiao</p>
<p>Teacher: Everyone should do a good deed every day. Have you done anything to help or save people every day?</p>
<p>Student A: Seeing the decline of industry, yesterday I smashed ten American glass cups in my uncle's house to protest for national products.</p>
<p>Student B: Teacher, I originally didn't plan to study, but then I thought about it. If we students don't study, won't the teacher have no food to eat? Therefore, I had a great compassionate heart and came here every day to hold the place for a few hours, just to help you, teacher!</p>
<h3>What is Life?</h3>
<p>— Hu Xiuru</p>
<p>(The following is a conversation between a fifteen-year-old middle school student and his teacher)</p>
<p>Student: Teacher, what is life?</p>
<p>Teacher: ... For a painter, life is drawing; for a musician, life is composing; for a doctor, life is treating illnesses; for a miser, life is making money; for a warmongering revolutionary, life is shedding blood...</p>
<p>Student: Teacher, then your life should be teaching!</p>
<p>Teacher: Yes, life has different interpretations in different eyes. Because there are differences, people ask which kind of life is happy. People like happiness and avoid worries, but in fact, all kinds of worries are revolving around you.</p>
<p>Student: I want to know what kind of life is happy.</p>
<p>Teacher: A happy life is made of truth, goodness, and beauty. Truth is the opposite of falsehood, goodness is the opposite of evil, beauty is the opposite of ugliness. If you don't deceive people, don't lie, and don't say that it was Ah Wei who broke the vase in your daily life, then you have truth. If you can say comforting words, such as encouraging a classmate who is held back, then you have goodness. Furthermore, if you don't do excessive things, such as when you take the tram; you sit properly in a space that fits your size and don't lean on two seats, if you can make people feel comfortable looking at you, then you have beauty.</p>
<p>Student: I understand a little.</p>
<h3>Character Sketch From "Platoon Leader" to Chairman - A Biography of General Wan Yaohuang</h3>
<p>— Youfu</p>
<p>The current Chairman of Hubei Province is General Wan Yaohuang, the former Education Director of the Military Academy. When he was once the Education Director of the Army University, those naughty students gave this old lieutenant general in his fifties a nickname - "Platoon Leader Wan."</p>
<p>As the name implies, the duties of a platoon leader, as explicitly stated in Article 51 of Section 21 of the Infantry Manual, are: "Under the command of the company commander, the platoon leader uses all means to educate the soldiers under his command to perform various duties during peacetime. During wartime, he commands his platoon to conduct combat according to the company commander's orders or intentions."</p>
<p>In other words, whether in peacetime or wartime, the platoon leader always lives with the soldiers, day and night, sharing life and death. In terms of training, the platoon leader is the officer closest to the soldiers. The soldiers' actions, even eating, dressing, walking, etc., all require the platoon leader to teach them at all times and in all places. Because there are uniform regulations for soldiers' eating, dressing, and walking, and even urination and defecation have specific locations and times (urination and defecation are not allowed during drills and classes), the platoon leader specifically supervises the soldiers' small movements and corrects them regardless of leisure or time, so that they become a typical and healthy soldier.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Education Director, Platoon Leader Style</p>
<p>When General Wan Yaohuang was the Education Director of the Army University, he adopted the style of a "platoon leader." He once said: "The more minor the matter, the more difficult it is to handle well. Soldiers must be vigilant and meticulous at all times, so pay special attention to small things!" He treated all the students of the Army University equally, whether they were old men in their fifties or division and army commanders, major generals and lieutenant generals who had commanded thousands of troops. As long as there was a problem, he would correct it immediately if he saw it. Once, the bugle for class sounded, and a student hurriedly came out of the toilet, forgetting to button one of his pants buttons. Just as "Platoon Leader Wan" saw it, he immediately reprimanded him, insisting that the student button it before he was allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Afterwards, that student (because he was a division commander by origin) publicized to other students that the education director was really inexplicable, treating us like three-year-old children, even managing our buttoning of buttons. This is really not the demeanor of a general, and is similar to the appearance of a platoon leader! We shouldn't call him the Education Director in the future, we should call him "Platoon Leader Wan."</p>
<p>In the summer of the 30th year, when General Wan Yaohuang was transferred to the Military Academy, the students of the Army University gave him a temporary evaluation: It is really appropriate for Platoon Leader Wan to be transferred to the Military Academy as Education Director. Because the students of the Military Academy will first serve as platoon leaders after graduation.</p>
<p>Various Problems are Headache-Inducing</p>
<p>After General Wan was transferred to the Military Academy as Education Director, he still couldn't get rid of the style of a platoon leader. During inspections, he would walk in front of the students and violently slap their shoulders, and then ask them: "Who is your Education Director?" "Who is your Captain?" "How wide are your shoulders?" "How many centimeters is your index finger?" "How long is your vertical line of sight from head to toe?" "How far is it from your classroom to your dormitory?" "How many windows are there in your classroom?" This series of extremely small questions made the students dizzy. If the student couldn't answer, he immediately ordered the officers to give this student special training.</p>
<p>At the memorial week, he publicly reported: "Yesterday I met several officers in a certain place, and they didn't salute me. I will never allow it next time."</p>
<p>Due to these facts, the young students also unanimously and boldly shouted "Platoon Leader." One day, General Wan came to the drill ground, and a group of students were happily saying: "The Platoon Leader is here." Unexpectedly, he heard it, and General Wan asked the students, "Who is the Platoon Leader?" "Which Platoon Leader is here!" The students were silent and dared not speak. Later, General Wan repeatedly guaranteed that there would be no punishment for speaking out, and then one student plucked up the courage to say "The Platoon Leader is the Education Director." The students around him burst into laughter. General Wan himself couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Now, Platoon Leader Wan has been transferred to Chairman of Hubei. This may be due to the celebration of his five years of "Platoon Leader" education at the Military Academy!</p>
<h3>Small Matters</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshi</p>
<p>During the enemy-puppet era, Avenue Joffre was renamed Taishan Road. At the same time, the concessions were recovered, and all police stations were uniformly renamed police bureaus. Consequently, the original Songshan Road Police Station was renamed Taishan Road Police Sub-Bureau. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the authorities renamed Taishan Road to Linsen Middle Road. Since the change of the road name to the present, it has been nearly a year, but the Linsen Middle Road Police Sub-Bureau in front still hangs the signboard of Taishan Road Sub-Bureau. This measure is really puzzling. According to the usual practice, the spirit of reform of the police authorities is ahead of the people and other administrative organs, but now that the signboard, which has been long gone in name, is still hanging at the gate of the bureau, it is quite worthy of discussion, I wonder if the authorities have noticed it?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the writer went to Hongkou twice for business and witnessed that many high-rise buildings have now been occupied by Chinese military and political organs or manufacturers run by officials and civilians. (Seen from the signs outside.) However, those houses were forcibly occupied by the enemy during the enemy-puppet era and were privately set up as warehouses or trading houses. Therefore, those huge signboards, such as Mitsubishi Corporation ×× Warehouse, Fukushima Corporation Shanghai Branch...etc. are still everywhere to be seen. In fact, since the current people in the house are no longer enemy-puppets, those signboards should have been removed long ago. Is it possible that they have spent great efforts to take back the houses, but now they don't even have the power to remove a signboard? Bauer, Director of the U.S. Economic Stabilization Bureau, loves dogs as friends.</p>
<h3>Gambling on Obscure Fields and Speculation</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhifu</p>
<p>In commercial transactions, there are so-called "gambling on obscure fields" and "speculation" tricks. In other words, merchants will find opportunities to scoop up a batch of goods, stockpile them for a certain period of time, and then sell them at a high price. Or they see that the market is lacking a certain kind of goods—and this kind of goods is exactly what most people urgently need—targeting the psychology of buyers and finding opportunities to make a fortune. However, unexpectedly, the same fashionable terms have actually appeared in the minds of young students. They also understand this set, and will make a fuss about this set, but only the objects and means they take are different. Merchants are engaged in buying and selling, but students are dealing with exams. That is, when students apply to a school, they will not ask about their own interests, but only choose departments with few people to apply for. Because they believe that as long as there are few people, it is easier to take the exam, and increase their "probability" of being "admitted."</p>
<p>I am not a merchant, and I have never engaged in buying and selling, so I have no way of knowing how merchants "gamble on obscure fields" or how they "speculate." However, I have personally heard the conversations of students. I have also personally seen a small number of students go to the schools holding the entrance exams on the last day of registration to inquire about the number of the registration forms, check how many people have registered for a certain department, and which department certain people have registered for, changing their plans according to the situation, and making the decision to register or not.</p>
<p>Of course, accurate speculation will allow merchants to scoop up a large amount of "ill-gotten gains," increasing their level of extravagance, and living a better life. For students, it will occasionally satisfy their desires" and be admitted by luck. But sometimes the luck is not good, and the "speculation" is empty. Not only will the merchants be ruined, but they will also be labeled as "profiteers," and students will also develop their laziness and ultimately end up "failing the exam."</p>
<p>"Luck only leads to failure." We should not forget this sentence. At the same time, we should not play tricks in our careers; we should not play tricks in exams either. We should put more effort into our own studies, and at least when applying to a school, we should consider our own interests and choose our departments.</p>
<p>Finally, I must declare that I am a student, and I am also a student who is hoping to be "admitted." The purpose of writing this article is to encourage myself not to make the "speculation" for the sake of the goal!</p>
