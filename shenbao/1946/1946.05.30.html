<p>〔中央社本市訊〕松江省政府主席關吉玉，嫩江省政府主席彭濟羣，哈爾濱市市長楊綽菴等，偕同各該省市接收人員五十一人，長春鐵路公司理事劉哲，萬異，率一領該公司高級職員六人，計六十二人，於本月十九日由海參巖同　蘇聯輪船司莫爾尼（Smolny）號，經日本東京返國，昨（二十九日）下午二時三十分抵滬，輪泊海關碼頭江心，海關副總稅務司丁貴堂聞訊後，特乘汽艦至輪邊，將渠等一一迎接登岸，上海市政府，外交部駐滬　事處派代表前往碼頭迎迓，時値微雨，陰雲時聚時散，氣候頗覺凉爽。關主席等均衣秋手服裝，雖經長途勞頓，精神仍極飽滿，與歡迎人員略事寒喧後，即分乘汽車逕赴旅邸休息。</p>
<p>記者於司莫爾尼輪上首晤見關主席，覺較土午底在重慶時，路見淸癯，與記者握手叙談，滿面笑容，至表愉快。渠首詢滬市現狀，經記者略作報吿後，繼即對此行經過，發表談話稱：松江有政府行政接收人員，自上月接奉隨蘇軍撤退令後，即與嫩江有，哈爾濱市接收人員，於上月廿三日趕抵哈爾濱，廿五日興嫩江省政府主席彭濟羣，哈爾濱市市長楊綽菴等，偕同接收人員五十一人，隨同蘇聯軍由哈爾濱撤退。於廿七日抵海　崴，乘輪來滬，俟交通工具接洽妥定後，即由滬趕赴瀋陽。</p>
<p>嗣晤見嫩江省主席彭濟羣，彭氏白髮滿頭，態度雍穆，記者叩詢東北接收情况，渠感感慨頗多，路稱：接管工作，一時談不盡，惟自奉令隨蘇軍撤退後，本省保安隊截至留守人員撤退時止，已經傷亡一千三四百人，省市兩醫院，均已住滿，並有四五千人，由該省保安警察總隊副總隊長王霖率領，作海擊戰，極盼國軍能早日到達。</p>
<p>最後記者叩詢劉理事哲，關於中長鐵路公司職員撤退經過，渠稱：四月二十八日，余即與萬理事異率領高級職員八人，由長春乘車底哈爾濱，廿五日復乘軍赴海參成，廿七日晟抵伏洛西洛夫車站，下車後即由蘇方招待，寓海濱療養院，五月十八日始乘司莫爾尼輪船繞道日本來滬。此行無所感觸，惟聞長春之戰，死亡軍民八千人，燒去市政府大棋二座，海上大樓一座，房產株式會社大樓一座，科學院大樓一座，前關東軍司令大樓一座，拓殖會社大樓一座，深爲可惜。此項建築物，工程偉大，恐非短時間所能恢復，現擬晋京謁見主席，再定行止。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕中宣部外記者招待會，廿九日下午四時半在該部舉行，彭部長學沛，外部劉次長　出席主持，茲將問答原詞譯誌如次；</p>
<p>問·政府對於最近和平談判之方針如何？政府之要求如何？政府之政策，是否與中央日報五月廿七日及廿八日社論所指出者相司？</p>
<p>答·若干方面關於最近和平談判之討論，對於若干基本事實，似有忽視之處，爲求和平及國家統一，政府曾同意若干協定，此類協定中有三點規定：（一）停止衝突，（二）恢復交通，（三）整編國軍及統編中共部隊，爲國軍本年一月十日停戰命令協定第二節第二款規定衝突停止（不影響國民政府軍隊爲恢復中國主權而進入柬北或在東北境內之調動），上述協定，均經公布，政府除要求共黨實踐諳言，履行協定外，別無其他要求。至君等所指中央日報社論，頗能反映政府之觀點及一般民衆之願望。</p>
<p>問·政府與共黨之和平談判何日重開？政協綜合小組及憲法審議小組何時復會？</p>
<p>答·政府與共黨及其他黨派經常保持接觸，各小組何日復開，正徵詢渠等之意見。余個人認爲，如上述各項基本問題能見諸實行，則政協小組中之問題實屬較易解決。</p>
<p>問·傳蔣主席曾吿馬歇爾將軍，停止衝突與恢復交通爲和平談判之先決條件，此訊確否？</p>
<p>答。主席與馬帥間之函件往還，余不能有所評論，惟諸君有檢閱余所指出之基本協定，則答案自屬明顯。停止衝突及恢復交通，固乃實現國家統一所必需之第一步驟，凡此並非新條件，實只前述協定中之一部分也。</p>
<p>問·國軍是否將前進接收哈爾濱與齊齊哈爾？</p>
<p>答，此一問題之答案，一如予在上次記者招待會所奉吿於諸君者，政府接收整個東北之責任，無可諉卸，但吾人始終願獲和平之解決。昨開共黨宣稱，共軍係奉延安之命自動撤出畏春，予頗希望渠等獲得同樣之延安命令，撤離其他各城市。</p>
<p>問。蔣主席將於何日自瀋陽歸來？</p>
<p>答·予不信主席本人已有決定</p>
<p>問·關於宣傳休戰之近况如何</p>
<p>答·自馬歇爾元帥來抵此發表聲明以來，吾人已重申對全國各報之勸告，第一：避免刋載不可靠及不重要之衝突消息，第二：避免謠言之攻擊，諸君當已看見，本部此項勸吿，已在各報得充分之反映，吾人將繼續勸勉各報，確守此種方針。吾人不待共黨如何決定，卽已採取此種措置，甚盼彼等亦能同樣辦理。共方建議凡衝突消息均由調處執行部及其執行小組統一發布，政府發現若干技術上之困難，未能同意，第一：調處執行部非通訊社可比，其公報必須經過覆査手續，故恐因遲而喪失新聞價値，第二：新聞如須主方同意方能發布，則其數量恐甚爲稀少，第三：如僅須兩方同意，則美方代表將時時處於極端爲難之地位，爲上述理由，故政府未便同意此項建議，但吾人深信，上述辦法已足解決目前之問題。</p>
<p>問，目前和平之條件，是否較下述諸階段更爲樂觀？（一）馬帥返華之時，（二）政府收復長春時，（三）政府似將收復中長鐵路時。</p>
<p>答，如此比較，頗爲不易，惟余以為和平前途殊為光明。</p>

<p>這幾天　蔣主席進行　　，正在展開東北的同胞，據廿九日美聯社北平消息，謂國軍於收復長春後，又克吉林，日將收取哈市，是最近在東北演變的局勢即將澄清，實足令人欣慰。我們懷念東北一望無垠的平原和北國的　空，對於近月來在發展著的局勢，為了國家民族的前途，於欣　之中，更　率直陳述我們的所見。</p>
<p>第一，東北是整個的：目今長春吉林　告收復，我們不能宿州任何東北特殊化的局勢，報載消息，謂共軍如放棄武力宰割東北企圖，並自動放棄哈爾濱齊齊哈爾等地，可能以　安省　　為共軍防區，並給予若幹便利，此雖為報載消息，是否可靠，　待　實，但我們站在國家民族的立場，不願看見東北的割裂，整個東北應由國府接管國軍接防是不應該有問題的。</p>
<p>第二，自馬　爾元帥　任以來，不特國內局勢未曾　　，即過去所　致為成果，亦有不保之　；對於這位和平使者實在應該覺得慚愧。我們不能讓這種局面拖延下去。我們要問為什麼經各方　　　訂的停止軍事衝突協定，恢復交通協定，以及閘於整個統編的協定，如今竟視同廢紙！這種經朝野各方代表以鄭重手續　訂之協定，如不能付諸實施，則此後商談，豈非徒托空言？中國人民於飽經戰爭的苦難以後，所希望的是和平，政府為了滿足人民這種願望，不惜委曲求全；然而協定既已成立，而國仙紛擾之局迄未寧　，交通依舊阻滯，國計民生，交感其苦。擺在眼前的事實，誰也不能　開這責任應該誰屬。為了人民，為了民族的生命，我們希望中共以事實表現出對於懷擁這些協定的至誠。</p>
<p>現在是應該以親愛來代替仇恨，而「無產階級無　國」這句話，也為兩次世界大戰所否定。中共總究還說不了中國兩個字，中國不宿州再有　爭；為了中國人民我們應該以親愛來代替仇恨，以合作來代替破壞。我們祈禱中共的回頭。</p>
<p>法軍侵暹事件平議</p>
<p>在這　　不安的　後世界中，我們最近又看見有因法軍　　而引起的衝突。據合眾社曼谷二十六日電：今日據　　所發　越漫境消息，法軍八百人　有　機大　，在越南之越　車南五哩處　過湄公河，使入　　國境，刻正與　　　民混合部隊激戰中。據該項消息稱，　事爆發於上星期五，是日　期，第一批法軍在越曾占領區東南五哩處地點　河，一小時半後，援軍　到，法軍開始向東推進，　即攻占暹國之龍蓋，並有集中襲取弗拉搭　之意，　　防綫迫西撤十哩。另　路透社同日消息，亦謂法軍於今晨越湄公河邊界兩點，佔領泰波，向龍蓋推進，暹政府業已向聯合國擬衣發出申訴，並請英美政府出面干涉，意欲經由外交途徑，謀取和平解決。法軍侵入時，暹國警察一度抵抗，旋即向內地撤退。法軍曾轟炸軍　，　　並邊國內地偵察。據上報導，一則從美國通訊社傳來，一則係由深入英國通訊社所發，來源不同，而所報導的事實則一，即法軍破　浸入暹　國境，並曾使用飛機大　，對暹國村市加以轟炸。對於這宗武裝衝突消息的傳來，實在令人扼腕。</p>
<p>據上開的報導，法軍侵暹，初曾遭警民的抵抗，但暹政府方面則據向聯合國機構提出申訴，並請英美政府出面干涉，意欲經由外交途徑，謀取和平解決，這咱和平政策的採取，值得我們的同情。據昨日本報訊：英外交部今夜正式宣布，暹羅決向聯合國安全理事會提出申訴，請求安理會立即調查法軍浸入並進犯暹境事實。英外部發言人並稱：英方實同將暹羅申訴置入安理會議程內。但據中央社紐約廿七日電，則請自曼谷傳來消息，雖稱暹政府已向安理會告發法軍侵犯暹羅區境，但聯合國秘書處迄未自暹羅政府接獲有關法軍侵入之報告。按聯合國憲章第廿五條規定，暹羅雖非聯合國會員，但如其預先聲明接受憲章所規定和平解決之義務，則有　提出控訴。然因英美刻　不久提出請暹羅加入聯合國，故在此情況下，暹羅此次對法之控訴，實令其侷促不安；是以法暹新糾紛，可能由美英出面調停，而不列入安理會議程。無論此次法暹糾紛是否將列入安理會議程，即或由英美出面調停，我們總希望這事件能　早日和平解決。因這次法軍侵暹事件的發生，却使我們起下列幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一，這次法暹衝突似乎不是偶發事件。據法國新聞社西貢廿七日電：法當局曾於本年四月間，與暹羅警方代表團舉行秘密談判，法當局要求暹羅以一九四一年佔據之柬埔寨及老撾南省歸還越南。據本報倫敦廿七日導，謂是項秘密談判進行已有兩月，討論集中於暹羅越南問題，已完全失敗，暹代表已離西貢。此次法軍渡湄公河侵入暹境，正當是項談判失敗之後，是其行動，跡近鑒於暹羅國際地位之孤單低落，思以武力企圖　迫暹羅就範，接受法方所提條件。法暹對於領土問題的爭執那是另一回事，我們在此對法方的要求，或暹方的過去行　是否　合理，不欲有所論列。但　使因條件的不能被對方所接受，而派兵入侵，或則企圖脅迫對方就範，或則企圖造成軍事占領的既成事實，以取得有利地位，凡此均為不法的行為，應為國際道義所不容。為了確保持久和平，我們申斥這種侵占行為。國與國間如果有領土的爭執，應循正當途徑謀取解決，決不能隨便使用武力。在國際關係上，我們堅持這原則，否則國際間的不法行為將層出不窮，足以威脅世界的持久和平。</p>
<p>第二，本於國際關係上不應輕易使用武力這一原則，我們應防止「邊界事件」的發生，並應確認一切邊界武裝衝突為不法，其發動邊界事件者應　法律的製裁。這次法軍入侵暹境事件，頗有一部人士以為「此亦不過一「邊界事件」而已，」輕描淡寫，漫不關心。在過去，邊界衝突，的確好像是家常便飯，如過去「張　峰事件，」「　門　事件，」都是比較著明的「邊界事件。」人類在經過了第二次世界大戰後，應該斥責這些「邊界事件，」在戰後的世界，應該不再有此類「邊界事件」的發生。「邊界事件」可能自　　的地方衝突　到頗具規模的戰爭。對於「邊界事件」的傳統觀念應隨原子彈的毀滅廣島長崎而俱毀。所以即使作為一種「邊界事件，」我們也以為法軍入侵暹境的不當；因為在這個時候，我們不容許再有「邊界事件」的發生，來破壞國際秩序。</p>
<p>第三，法國在這次世界在戰中飽經憂患和創傷，應該有一種自新的覺悟。越南的重歸法國懷抱，此在國際正義上講是否為明智，固然又是另一回事，非我們所欲論列。但國際人士所希望於「第四共和國」的，就是法蘭西應有一種新的自覺。法國統治越南所採取的陳腐殖民政策，如果繼續採行，必將遭遇抵抗。這次法軍侵暹，雖真相未盡大白，但據已知消息，無疑地又是這種陳腐殖民政策在作崇。這是嵋於這種陳腐殖民政策的執行，所以　有　等「邊界事件」的發生。此　　　地方事件，　得中　的認可；但我們　　　後的「第四共和國，」能以　的　　，　　　　，來應付　的時代。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯，今日逐條答覆蘇　外長莫洛托夫之指責，否認美英兩國已組成反蘇集團。貝爾納斯之答覆，並引證巴　四國外長會議紀錄為根據。關於表達　允許幫助美國所提訂立四國二十五年條約　視　國解除武裝一事，莫洛托夫謂貝爾納斯所言不確，貝爾納斯茲亦從垂加以答復稱：莫洛托夫至少承認表達　會在原則上贊成此事云。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞華盛頓廿八日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日在新聞記者招待會中，對真理報所刊莫洛托夫之談話，發表意見：</p>
<p>廿五年協定蘇確會贊同</p>
<p>關於更達林對四強二十五年協定之意見（該項協定係貝爾綱斯在巴黎所建議者），貝氏稱：一九四五年九月二十日會與莫洛托夫在倫敦談及此事，同時並就更達林在雅爾達對波蘭問題所發表之談話，提請莫洛托夫注意。該項談話謂：在二十五年中，波蘭曾兩次被利用作為進攻俄國之走廊，且美國有重行退出歐洲事件及德國東山再起之危　，貝氏繼謂：在倫敦時，渠曾以蘇聯是否願意簽訂四強廿五年協定一事詢諸莫洛托夫，請求莫洛托夫表示意見。當時並聲明協定細則即可擬定。莫洛托夫答謂：渠不能表達政府之意見，但可將此項計劃呈轉政府。莫洛托夫並謂渠對此項協定，甚感興趣。一九四五年十二月廿四日，渠以以前致達莫洛托夫之建議交與史達林，史氏答謂：若提出建議者為貝氏，渠決予以絕對之贊助，二月十四日，渠將是項文件交與莫洛托夫，並附以　本人與莫氏談話之備忘錄，後　對於是項建議，當在原則上表示贊同。貝氏續謂：當時如有疑問，蘇聯官員　可提出。四月份在巴黎時，渠向莫洛托夫表示願意討論此項問題；四月二十日，渠接　莫氏之函件，內稱：蘇方反對協定之草案，但對德國解除武裝問題，則未提及。貝氏復稱：即在巴黎時，莫氏對渠所發表關於史達林意見之談話，亦未表示懷疑，貝氏謂渠旋即請求美國駐德副司令克萊中將轉請柏林之盟國委員會共同行動小組委會遣派代表前赴每一區域，視察戰爭工廠及個人這解除武裝情形，英法對此均表同意，但蘇聯政府則僅贊同解除軍隊之武裝，對於解除工廠武裝，則並不表示贊同。目前是否仍在製造戰爭武器，貝代認為此點甚為重要。</p>
<p>貝代強調　稱：美國所建議之解除武裝二十五年協定，已超乎互助協定，此種方法可在戰爭未爆發前，直達戰爭之根源，當史達林及莫洛托夫瞭解此點後，甚盼能成立協定。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫談話中所指之英美集團，貝氏絕對否認，並請美國歡迎各方面之意見。</p>
<p>義大利問題美政第不變</p>
<p>至於美國對義大利續　問題所採取之立場，貝氏謂此事始終杜魯門所報告之菠茨坦會議，為適合蘇方見解計，美國曾對賠償問題作若幹讓步，但　人之意見，迄未改變，我人不願以資金幫助義大利賠償。</p>
<p>對於義大利殖民地問題，渠謂吾人在倫敦會議時即主張按照聯合國委任　治制度，由中立之行政人員統治，美國之政策迄今仍無若無變更。貝代謂此舉將使蘇聯與　國之機會均等，美國甚盼蘇聯贊同此項建議。美國同意法國之義大利托治建議於獲得蘇聯贊同後接　之，並共同簽訂一協定。惟渠鑒特義大利殖民地應限期宣佈獨立。貝氏謂美國願討論未經聯合國同意之問題，美國亦無改變此項願　之意。美國願提供世界問題於世界輿論之前。「吾人係生存於同一世界之中，且願在同一世界中生存。」渠與莫洛托夫均關於和會召開之前獲致有關和約之協議。莫洛托夫殷望各種問題　政府研究並加以冷靜之　　後將進而獲致協議，會信渠仍有此項希望。</p>
<p>軍事基地事為安全著想</p>
<p>關於莫洛托夫指責美國對軍事基地之要求，已超出安全範圍一事，貝爾納斯指陳稱：去年十月間，美國向冰島提出建議前，美國事先即照會英蘇兩國政府，謂美國借用冰島空軍基地及其他軍事設備之目標，係　　保聯合國之安全。貝爾納斯並謂：冰島加入聯合國後，冰島當能運用　主權，使空軍基地及其他軍事設備供為安全理事會之用。美國對此事曾有兩種願望，一為美國自身之安全，一為聯合國之安全。渠謂美國僅有非作戰人員七百五十人駐留冰島。對於史達林曾　求貝爾納斯進行美蘇友好經濟及諒解協定談判事說，貝爾納斯謂渠迄未接　此項要求，惟美蘇間之外交消息往返確曾討論貸款及其他有關之問題。關於此事，貝爾納斯謂美國會建議訂立一支好，商業及航空協定。論及莫洛托夫關於盟國佔領義在利費用之文告，貝爾納斯謂佔領確係義大利之一大負荷，惟就能認為義大利對支付戰爭代價之一。渠並謂此項代價大部已與吾人對義大利人民之協助抵消。</p>
<h3 id="c38">關於和約問題　法國與英美兩國　站於同一陣綫　畢杜爾作公開表示　法國外交絕對獨立 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿八日電〕關於和約問題，法外長畢杜爾，今日公開表示，法國與英美站於同一陣綫，以對蘇聯之　見。畢氏聲稱：六月十五日之四強外長合議如不　成立協議，則贊成將此和約問題交與聯合國　構全體大會。該項計　原係美國務卿貝爾納斯所提出者。畢杜爾表示希望謂：貝代所擬兩者擇其一之辦法，將不感需要。並指出若干新的因素可能在下次會義前使局勢軒趨明朗。但渠警告謂：此種新的因素，必須第一外長重返巴黎時抱有成立協議這志願，　能促成協定。如能達到如此地步，則上次會議內　應未決之各項問題，可以解決矣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕法外長畢杜爾　告　　稱：特呈埃斯特港　屬問題，法國將　所建議，務使其　獲得解決。義大利殖民地問題所以未獲協議，乃由於美國所採取之態度所致，　對於德國問題，反　將德國　分　東西兩區，但願將　地利問題與德國問題分別　　，法國　採取絕對獨立之外交政策，　美　或　布所能收買。</p>
<h3 id="c39">蘇聯抵制英美合作　加強東南歐聰明　援助波南等國穩固邦交 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿八日合眾電〕蘇聯加強其於東南歐同盟體系之舉，可　為莫洛托夫解釋英美政策為意國　　蘇聯之第一步驟。蘇以對波蘭給予財政經濟軍事協助之方式，穩固蘇波同盟。此舉情恰符合於莫洛托夫所稱，蘇聯將不屬服於傳說之英美意欲「強加其意志」於蘇聯，及統治世界之企圖之下。波總理　拉夫斯基及波軍總司令西米斯基，南離此間，南總理蒂托即繼而抵莫斯科，同來者尚有參謀總長及內長。蘇聯可盼予南國以同等之援助，傳穩固兩國間之邦交及加強南國軍力，蘇波協定成為蘇聯援助其盟國之典範，並預言蘇聯準備犧牲以加強其友邦，其他與莫洛托夫聲明相關之步驟，將　　　生。</p>

<p>〔本報訊」行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會，昨晨花市府會議室，舉行第八次例會。吳市長主席，決定今後分配房屋，　儘量公開，隨時公佈，使外間對該會工作澈底明瞭。至文化社團以及任何個人申請者均將俟必需留滬之中央政府機關分得房屋後，如有餘屋，再予酌配。同時對房屋分配爲防止弊端起見，決定所有配給房屋之機關，必須限於自用，如査獲有將房屋轉讓頂出者、除予收回該項房屋，並將機關名稱予以公佈外，其經手人員，決送交法院嚴辦，以儆効允。據該會負貴人談，目前遭遇最大困難爲海空軍及後勤司令部隊，在上海佔用房屋數彙甚鉅，而該主管機關，迄無詳細淸册，送會核辦。聞該會已決定分電軍政部陣誠部長，空軍周至柔主任，及後勤部黃振球總司令，請指定負責人參加該會治辦住屋事宜，以便騰出空屋配給其他機關。據稱現軍事機關中，以京滬衛戍司令部湯司令官對部下約束最爲嚴正，除核准之五十幢房屋請求該會予以承認外，所有暫時借用之住屋八十七幢（內有敵產十七幢）均已列表報會，將限令本月底予以遷讓，以協助該會工作之進行</p>
<p>至外間謠傳該會已發出大量許可證事，頗有誤會，緣迄至今日止，該會除對迫切需要房屋之地方法院發給許可證十張及高等法院杜檢察官一張外，並未有其他許可證發出。而地方法院雖有許可證，但以房屋現住人猶未搬出，尙不能即行遷入居住。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午十時起，高院特刑庭，由蕭庭長爕　曹推事據分別審理漢奸案件四起，茲分誌於下：</p>
<p>陳伯落上海人，四十七歲，畢業於日本火學法律系，戰前經營火柴，曾任上海大中華火柴有限公司董事長，民國廿九年兼僞無任所公使；三十四年二月春，充任僞立法院委員，三十年，改任僞日用品統制委員會副主三月，又任僞駐日大使館並參贊，任委員等　。　　後山　統局上海辦事處拘解高檢處偵査，陳對土列事實供認不　，並稱曾經協助抗戰，供給我方敵僞經濟情報等語。檢察官則以雖經軍統局來函，認爲被吿担任工作，尙非虛語，自可作爲量刑參考，但與犯罪之成立，不生影響，依法提起公訴。昨日審問之下，辦護律師以證人黃克夫，陳祖康均未到庭，要求再行傳證，庭諭改期審訊</p>

<p>葉耀先　浙江遂昌人，三十二歲，係李士羣之內侄。民國廿八年九月，經李援引，充任僞特工總部總務處文書股長，廿九年七月，升該部偽總務處長，三十一年又任僞江蘇銀行經理。在各僞職任內，戕害中央地下工作人員，偵察軍事政治，經濟消息，昨日審問時，葉逆猶圖抵賴。</p>

<p>— 黃雲秋</p>
<p>法科的人，每都羨慕著北京的朝陽與蘇州的東吳，為的是它們歷史久，校友多，殊不知南國的錢　也有一所歷史久，校友多的法科學校，那便是現在福州的福建學院。</p>
<p>福州的福建學院，在問　兩省早就有了「南方的朝陽」之稱。自從國民革命軍光復了福建起，這所學校便應聲落地，最初的名字據說是什麼「法政學堂」，後來改為「福建法政專門學校」，民國二十年才改為現在這個名字。這其間，編製也有了很多更變，最初僅辦法律一科，其後添了政治，到民國十八年才加上經濟，（民國二十六年添了農攻學院，打算擴展為「福建大學」，辦現　南半載，便因故流產了，該　覺學院便　　獨立成為目前福建省立的醫農兩學院。）直到現在止，歷史足足已有三十五年了。當校友的總數，目前難得統計，不過舉一個例來說，福建六十四縣中，有半數以上縣長，百分之四十參議員，百分九十之法官，是由該院畢業的。其他各部門因有「脈絡相等」，自然更見得多了。一所私立學校之得以成立和成長，一半同由於董事會之主持，一半也應該仰靠校友補助的。福建學院使在這「雙管齊下」之下，不惟八年抗戰給它無損分毫，而且更加繁榮起來。抗戰期間，它一搬便搬到閩治之六都，後又移至白雲渡，在遷徙期間內舉　校舍，交通工具，員生宿舍，膳食等，幾乎全由各地校友自動協助，該院同學出路問題，也都有樣友爭著替他們謀解決。另的可以　　，同學間能這樣團結，親愛·互助·互持·倒是值得佩服的。去年，抗戰還未勝利，福州剛一克服，該院一體同學便哄著要「回到福州去」，結果醫生咐員的也通過了，七月間便開始遷移。這樣一來，福建學院況成為全國各大學復員最光的一個。蘇州的校舍，坐落在城南的白水井地方，這　沒有了市中心區那樣的　　空氣，因為瀕近郊野的緣故，這部分帶些鄉村的氣味，校舍的後面是風景優秀的鳥石山，隔壁是高等法院，建築得還相當寬敞和威嚴。這學期福建師專遷到山上面，醫學院又遷到它鄰近幾百步的李氏宗祠內，看來白水井一帶將成為福州的「大學區」了。當然，福建學院的同學，接近到他（她）們，是萬分歡迎的。</p>
<p>全院依舊法律·政治·經濟三系。本學期還招有司法·銀行兩組，看情形將來可能擴充為法商學院。院長郭公木氏，且揚　要使它變成一所大學，這大抵是可能的。學生以法律系為最多，全院學生人數現已有五百餘人，低年級班招收太多，結果，三班　兩百餘人，這在國內大學看來是罕見的。這兒的教授，也仍以法律系較充實，不少是校友，也有幾位外國籍的，學問都還說得過去。</p>
<p>最後，我要介紹到該院的兩個特色：第一個，就是圖書館存書多，福建學院的圖書館，就是福州有名的鳥山圖書館，設在院本部附近的鳧山翼下，是一個完全用銅骨水泥併成的巨大建築物，兩座西式房子，第一層專供閱覽室及同學晚間自修用的，第二層全部為「存書庫」，第三層為一廣大晾台，夏天晚上可供乘涼，閱覽　眺福州夜市等和。全體存書屬於古籍方面的有六萬冊，現代版的約五萬冊，他如新書，舊雜誌，也應有盡有，在數量方面據說　次於廈大協大而居全省第三，然而文法一類圖書，該院尤報全省牛耳了。第二個特色，就是該院附中辦理成績卓著，高中初中兩部學生人數，已達一千三百人以上。遷到福州後，校務進展更其迅速，附中校長為林鴻祺，訓導主任是以「鐵面」見稱的陳光祖，全校計有十七八班之多，低年級更見擁擠，這也許由於私校入學考試尺度較寬的緣故。</p>
<p>國立林森大學籌備之初，是打算把福建學院包括在內，後來該校友　一致反對，唯一的原因，是「不願更改院名」，看來這所學院是有其一部雄厚信心的，歷史久了，基礎根深蒂固了，自然要撼動也困難了！</p>

<p>（一）周成華問　鄙人為蕪湖人，戰後陸機關撤退入川，家父年邁，不願離鄉，舍間所有福　房屋供二十餘間，家父除自住數間外，其餘均分租親友居住，家鄉淪陷，家父最初手頭多餘，不料因戰事拖延太久，舉債累累，迫不得已，乃於三十三年，將所有房屋全部出售，買主見家父　態，故意殺價，忍痛出售，遂立出賣字約，並憑中書押做　，嗣後不但弟妹教育婚嫁等費無著，即家父生養死葬之費料無所出，不知離偽統治下民間買賣契約行為，是否生效？</p>
<p>〔端本愷師答〕倘無被迫於敵偽勢力情形，其買賣契約自不能謂為無效。來函即稱因家窘出賣，則係出於自願，殊無追債損失可言。</p>
<p>（二）貝　問　聞貴　內有曹廷璋君詢問戰前房產抵押預備　取質疑一事，據端木律師答復：為戰前債務與存款同樣辦理「參照復員後辦理民訴補充條例第十二條」等語，但未悉永遠條文如何解釋？緣敵人所詢與曹君事同一律，敬請在報端披露，不勝感荷。</p>
<p>〔端本愷師答〕該條所稱法律行為，係指一切契約則言，借嘗自屬包括在內。</p>
<p>（三）蘇州　英問　敝人於抗戰前曾購田產十數畝，訂有契約，該賣主於出售其田產這前後，曾向敝人借款二次，惟後者已於去年勝利後，依本利一併歸回，惟　地風俗，凡訂立產業賣買契約時，須按值十分之一價洋，另附立一名　借標，茲有數疑如下：</p>
<p>（一）此類另附之勸借契約在法律上有無規定？（二）若有規定，同當受買契約未成立前之銀洋借據能否為憑？（三）保存迄今仍屬有效否？（四）如該出賣人用種種方法需索或強迫另立勸借　時，可否向法院起訴，以確保人民產業？</p>
<p>〔端本愷師答〕（一）（二）法律上並夫規定，（三）詞意欠明，（四）可訴求救濟。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕頃據中國蠶絲公司技術處處長鄒景衡氏談稱，以目前將業現狀觀之，我國絲業前途，實感焦慮，就目前絲業之危機言，不外：（一）糧價太貴，蠶農咸以繭價與糧價比例計算，以目前情形言，大致爲米三担抵鮮繭一担，如低過此項比例，則蠶農寗可掘去桑樹，改爲稽田，而桑樹一旦掘去，新系培植，至少須達五年，方能供用，再就工力而言，亦因糧價高昂，隨以俱漲，生產成本殆將無法减低，（二）生產費用與原料費用增漲之比例，太失平衡，茲以煤價而言，已較戰前增漲的一萬六千倍，而絲價之增漲，不過爲戰前之二千三百倍，佔計戰前產絲一担，生產費用佔二成，原料費用（繭價）佔八成，換言之，蠶農可實得八成，而目前生絲每担雖已漲至二百卅萬元，此中製造費已佔一百萬元，故蠶農所能得到者，僅一百卅萬元，然製造生絲一担須乾繭四担，而鮮繭三担，方能烘焙成乾繭一担。照此比例計算，乾繭每担僅合十萬元强，已與米三担抵鮮繭一担之比例價，相去五成，蠶農旣感不敷成本，而在收繭當局如照此價收進，再以目前生絲價格合算，仍將虧蝕不堪，。抗戰八年，我國產絲技術及人才，兩皆凋落，故產絲多未合標準，羅致專才，更感困難，（四）外界威脅，（甲）爲人造絲代用品之興起，例如美國在戰時，因缺乏生絲，乃大量利用尼隆（Nylon）織造絲襪，現所有絲襪製品，利用尼隆質料者，已佔百分之七十五，雖云戰後生絲仍將恢復大批利用，惟如生絲價格過高，恢復利用之百分比例必不甚大，（乙）爲日本絲業之復興，麥帥允許日本恢復輕工業，其重要性除糧食工業佔首位外，生絲工業卽次佔位，而日本生絲工業之生產成本，視戰前固無劇烈變動，故日本生絲工業之復興條件，實較我國爲優，麥帥此舉，當係爲解決日本人民之生活而來，惟同時仍望能顧全我國生絲工業之復興。</p>
<p>又訊，中國蠶絲公司業於本月廿三日起，陸續開始在蘇浙皖各產絲區收繭，此中共分四區，計安徽毫縣區，淅江嘉興長安區，江蘇吳江蘇州區，及無錫常州溧陽區等，以上各區，共計有繭行五十八家，預計可收鮮繭約八千餘担，據云下月六日左右，卽可收購竟事。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　邵慎之</p>
<p>自由之翼</p>
<p>四月廿八日的那天，芮克少校武官原定早晨起飛，結果又因汽油關係，仍遙遙無期。午後大家都沒精打彩底睡覺。當正是午睡方　，忽然芮克少校，把世洵喚說：下面有人談話。他走下樓時，看見一個穿黃色軍服的共軍青年，他很有禮貌走上前來問道：「請問是趙先生嗎？」世洵遂答道：「不敢，請問先生貴姓？」他說明他自己姓劉名柯，並且交來一封周保中給我們的信：</p>
<p>「世洵先生芮克少校：茲介紹我的秘書劉柯同志，今後芮克少校汽油事情，以及中美記者外出遊玩等事，皆可找劉同志辦理。周保中四月廿八日。」</p>
<p>劉柯是吉林人，說一口很流利的英語。他告訴世洵，他是燕大政治第畢業的學生。他的頭腦相當民主，我們和他談話，都覺得大家全抱著客觀態度，他沒有共軍中下級政治指導員一貫的，簡單的，狹小的，不民主的，想談而談不出什麼東西的，使人聞之生厭的政治八股理論。</p>
<p>廿九日的早晨，周保中和他親自來記者寓所，把芮克送到機場，看他起飛。此地劉柯進常來，有時帶大包烟，有時送許多酒。一坐下來，便東南西北，談個痛快。他脫下軍服，換起中山裝，更是隨便了。我們很坦白底告訴他，「秘密電台」的事情，他聽了大笑不已，他承認共軍裏一般的科學常識不夠。學這麼樣的勇於招認，博得了我們對他的新的估計。</p>
<p>二日下午，他來伴我們去大和旅館，應共方長春市長劉居英的午　，他告訴我們北平執行部來電報，準備派飛機接我們回瀋陽。我們高興極了，可是見克特忽然　咀道：「今天早晨我在洋台上看，來了兩個飛機，在西機場不斷打圈，下面開槍。來接我們的飛機，恐怕又要出亂子。」果然，在吃飯的時候，周保中說：「上午來了兩個飛機，低飛掃射，我們一定有死傷，我現在還未得到確切報告。我們的戰士以為，這是來接你們的飛機，所以都跑出去，沒標記，想不到開槍了。」他說他決不阻止我們的飛返，但是，飛機塲炸壞了那就是糟糕！這是我們第一次的失望。</p>
<p>四日上午，也主濁東北局請我們吃晚飯的那天，劉柯又來告訴我勻，明天有北平執行部派飛機來接我們。這電報是給東北局的，四日晚上，我們都把行李裝好，準備明天出發，可是五日清晨忽然來了周保中的副官，滿口要找劉柯說話，後來他知道劉柯不在。於是告訴我們今天飛機不來，要我們轉告劉柯，不必伴我們去機場了。等到劉柯趕來，他真是不知道，弄得莫明其妙的再回轉去向周保中。後來我們在張學思那兒，周保中特地趕來，讓劉柯　白　德給我們的電報。內稱：</p>
<p>「我明日在上午十二時至下午二時間，決派專機在長降降，接你們回來」。</p>
<p>這是我們第二次的失望。</p>
<p>因為兩次的失望，我們對於我們的飛航，連自己都不敢信託起來了，回來貝克特第一個表示「明天一准又沒有希望」。他朝著我們苦笑，於是我們向他建議，與其悶在家裏，不如上安琪兒舞場去。我們終於又進入了這黑暗的場所。我們坐著，真是喘喘不安。</p>
<p>六日上午凱豐和劉柯同來，教我們準備出發，一時弄得手忙腳亂，我們在行前，先把五個工友遣散，這是他們五人事先向我們要求的。遣散的時候，一面要籌一筆遣散費。一面又要算清這廿天來每人用去的伙食費，慎之和世洵都是囊空如洗，結果誰有誰先拿出來，反正到了瀋陽再算賬。當時之窘狀，好氣好笑！</p>
<p>一會兒呂正操也來了，他是代表東北局來替我們送行的。我們在一小時後又到這西機場！</p>
<p>西機場，除房子稍有破壞外，其他一如昨日。虎　的風聲裏再也喚不著火藥氣味來。草長得高高的，遍地挖著坑，到處著木條，堆著汽油桶，這是障礙物！</p>
<p>在機場的兩個小時，一會兒把風帶走了。我們等到三時半，仍飛機的影子。我們都垂首喪氣的又回到原來的屋子暑天　去。心裏真想哭一塲，我們夠失望了！這是欠產第三次的失望。我們中美記者八人，決聯名電執行部，說我們天天在機場等。</p>
<p>我們回來，工友都沒有了。爐子裏沒有火，強裏是空空的，　然是一個已經被人遺棄了不少年的古屋。這種陰森的氣象，會使我們可怕。但是，我們得科於要活下去，所以世洵和貝克特像瘋狂般地在滿街上亂跑，想找兩個日本女人，替我們燒飯或洗滌。</p>
<p>夜幕在下降。走了半天，汗珠在頭上直滴下來，沒有結果。兩個人只得大踏步的向寓所走去。忽然，一個破屋中走出一個老者和一個少年。世洵問他們幹什麼的，老者姓劉名貴，他說他是幹大司務的，那少年是他的兒子。世洵和貝克特高興極了，管他好壞，便把他們帶回來。反正有人了總好辦。說也奇怪，送上來的晚餐，並不下於吳大帥的尊廚。大家奇異說：「這真是像一個兒童讀物裏的神仙故事」！</p>
<h3 id="c133">歸返瀋陽 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>七號那天，我們起得特別遲，滿想今天不　來飛機的，可是早餐方畢，盟　和劉柯又來了。劉柯的神情非常匆促，他說：「飛機已經停在機場了，我們立刻準備出發，機子是不多停留的。」當我們的亭子過與安橋的時候，牛市鐸面車子裏馳過來的是芮克海格和開卷有益國新聞宣傳處總編輯抗勤思，這時，才把心放下來，我們是走定的了。</p>
<p>一會兒，周保中也趕來送行，看我們的樣子在下午一時三十分離南向南起飛！</p>
<p>一小時後到達瀋陽，不禁歡呼一陣。國際宣傳處陳祖潤和軍　處美國代表知道了消息，趕到機場來歡迎我們。我們回到瀋陽，心裏又快活又難過，我們這時才知道無論是在瀋陽的政府軍政長官，中共的朋友，以及可敬愛的中外同業們所關懷著，他們向我們致慰問，　呼熱腸，使人感動，我們不過經歷了一塲戰火而已，可是點火還在向中國人身上燒去，此時此地，我們不禁淌下淚來。</p>
<p>無論是認識或不認識的朋友，他們在瀋陽，在北平，或在別的地方，為我們打聽安全消息於前，又為我們向執行部交涉，遣派飛機，迎返瀋陽於後。特別是我們的同來，這種無比可貴的情誼，我們將永遠記得，將督促我們，在我們共同的崗位上站得更緊些。（全文完）</p>

<p>— 本報台灣二十日航訊　特派員暮雲</p>
<p>在台北縣　境風，文山，蘇澳，　東三區內都有相當數額的蕃族，這些蕃族包括著「南澳蕃」，「咬狗岸蕃」，「溪頭蕃」等，俗稱高砂族，是有日本人的約束和教育過的熟蕃，他們實是道　地的原始的本省人。因為現在所稱的本省人，實在是從內地南中國福建泉州廈門和廣東飄海過來的商人，他們是在這裏保有數代的血統關係而已，實際上，土著的台灣的住民，是在明末以後，一部份的印度支那民族被迫逃往深山幽谷，與現代文明隔絕，過著原始的生活，他們之中的一部，就是現在的迅蕃——高砂族。</p>
<p>日人迄未征服</p>
<p>記者於本月六日赴台東一帶踏查，順便蘇澳東澳和羅東的濁水瑪　一帶實在察看高砂族的生活，從羅東到濁水的小火車裏（該綫係台灣拓植會社所建，專為運太平山木材之用，便載乘客，自二月十五日起，由工礦處農林處共同接管，自羅東至終點土塲，全長三七·一公里，廖區長和不知這裏十多年的陳先生，他們指著有對著在　氣籠罩的山　說，日本人化了八九年工夫，在這個山　裏被射死了很多人，這裏是他們征蕃的墳墓。這些年頭裏，蕃民被約束著沒有野生的自由，沒有生命的保障，他們種植的行動部被圈定了的，而且他們又強注著日本的教育和言語，可是日本人降服以後，在他們單純的腦　裏頓起了反作用，他們重燃起抗爭之怒火，他們說「迄未征服」。</p>
<p>蕃族生活一斑</p>
<p>在濁水馬　一帶，盤踞著的高砂族的同胞有四九〇戶，約二百六〇人，他們在太平山的總數在八千以上，蘇澳較少，約六千餘人，其他散處在花蓮港新竹各地中，他們的生活，都是同一的型工：蹲在狹小的木屋裏，　集在山崖的一邊，屋子裏　僅有的是工的蓆疊，但在泥土上，用著木柴堆燒著山芋皮和野草，地種野生的氣息，遠超越日本人所給予的「文明程度。他們大都能操日本語，他們中的男子，白天不是在屋內　　背籃，弄刀，就是上山裏去耕作，打柴。德國工程師在清水山麗，用十二公里長的不管的水力發電，供給山區住民應用，但高砂族是不慣於享用的。婦女們多數穿著破舊的衣衫，也有穿洋服的，面部都刺著花紋，在東澳我們遇見一個高砂族的女子，坐在席上編結　　，她是在台灣大學附屬醫院裏做看護。在瑪　則碰到現在　察所畢業的日青年，她和他們都是最出色的人物。農業的耕地和種植，是原始的，不施肥，在一二年後便不再耕種，把用地搬了塲。每一個民家都有「倉庫」，米，山芋野菜，花生都貯在高另搭得高高的像鴿籠似的小屋裏，他們說這樣是可以避免鼠　的，和本省人通婚的女子要受族人最嚴厲的懲罰的，但在濁水，一個高砂笑的看護，卻跟著日本醫生回東京去了。</p>
<p>青年蕃人談話</p>
<p>記者和一個剛從台北警察訓練所畢業回來的蕃人五德生，作簡單的談話，他正在學習用日本語注釋的　語。當記者詢及光復後蕃族的生活實感時，他回答著：「光復後一個時期，蕃人害怕著中國政府不知將取怎樣的態度，大家都著了慌，現在卻逐漸　變了，不過一般都以為以前的米價只有幾角錢一斤，現在卻漲得利害，受不了了。個人很想為政府以及蕃族做一點工作。不地政府絕不能答應他，是個問題。」記者告訴他，政府對蕃族是全國同胞樣看待的，過去日本的約束全部解除了，將來可以取得職業和生活的自由的。（濁水　所於蕃民地區人口處已公佈取水舊有生蕃，蕃仔名稱），他們一起有一三五個蕃族青年，在當地是個領袖人物，他傳達了政府和當地警察局的意見，到族內去，他成了一個極重要的中間份子。</p>
<h3 id="c135">美科學家預言　病菌不怕配尼西靈 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>在墨克學院研究治療學的莫早特博士（Dr．Hous　Molitoi），在美國實驗生物學團體聯合會上，發表了一項驚人預言，說「配尼西林」在五年至十年之內，將失去治療的效用。</p>
<p>除非化學家能改進配尼西林，便它繼續有用，否則患肺炎和鏈狀球菌的傳染病的病人，將需要新的殺菌劑來治療。</p>
<p>現在的有各種偉大的藥品如配尼西林，斯特普湯密斯（Strep　tomycin）在幾年之內，將變為沒有用的廢物，這原因是病菌對這種化合物的抵抗力不斷加強，莫利特博士預言：將來醫生們，要用一千倍的藥量和更快地使用，才能使病人痊癒。</p>
<p>有一種可以防禦配尼西林成為無效的辦法，是除非真正需要，僅量不要給病人吃這種藥。把這種藥製成藥片，或藥膏的形式，使病人服用後，只得到很少量的化合物，否者在它不能治療的病症，如流行性感冒中使用，勢將加速配尼西林的失效。</p>
<p>當使用配尼西林的時候，所用的藥量一定要能在幾日之內，在病菌還沒有習於這種藥性而產生抵抗之前殺死病菌。（譯自三朋二十三日「科學通訊」）</p>

<p>— 毛樹奎　廿七日寄自南京</p>
<p>湖南省的一位國大代表告訴記者說：「湖南省在抗戰中出的力最多，受的災也最重，目下整個湖南已瀕於絕境，糧荒，屋荒，衣荒……無一不荒，當我們代表國經過岳陽時，數百民眾代表，前來請願，要求國大代表們晉京以後，將災懷向中央陳訴，希望能迅速獲利救濟。這些民眾代表中，很多祇穿一條短褲。——一件完整的布衣，在這裏是視為奢侈品的。岳陽縣長本來有一個報告災情的小冊子給我們，但是縣政府因為付不起印刷費用而作罷。縣府的公務員，現在每天只吃一餐飯。」</p>

<p>讀者們常常聽到災黎吃草根樹皮的故事，但不一定能明白他們的吃法，現在有實例可以報告給讀者：湖南的雪　山，武功山等一帶　山中，遍長著野生的葛藤，饑民就把這種葛藤的根掘出來，一大捆一大捆的搬回家，用石麿　榨出乳白色的　　。入沸水熬　後，變成一塊一塊半凝固的東西。據說裏面有點　紛質，味微苦，現在千萬湖胞，就靠　這種葛根來維持生命。</p>
<p>湖南本是產米區，但是經過敵人的搜括與軍糧的收購，已把所有的存糧搬空了。再加上去年的旱災，於是在目前造成了空前大　饑。成　的難民向都市集中，然而都市中又有什麼呢？</p>
<h3 id="c138">幸運的房屋　全城僅剩十四幛 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>省會長沙經過六次會議，一塲大火，所剩的房屋祇不過了一個月又十八天的慘烈巷戰，燒了又炸，炸了又燒，勝利後，全城僅有十四幢房屋　運的存在著。當德在無數次的爭　戰後，早成了一堆瓦礫，所剩下的僅是半個堡壘。沿粵漢路湘粵段兩旁數十里內找不到人烟，人民在如此困境下，還要負擔軍糧，今年的　　總額，初定為一千二百萬石，事實上，集全省之所有，恐怕也不能償過這麼多的軍糧。後經當局核減為四百萬担，你想，已在吃草根樹皮的湖南人那裏還有能力供給軍糧？結果，收不到十分之一，就停止下來了。</p>
<h3 id="c139">糧食早空　山上樹木被伐光 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>湖西雖然未遷敵寇的蹂躪，但在湖南湖中戰局緊張的時候，湖西是個大兵站，過境的軍隊要這樣，要那樣，湘西一向是有名的貧瘡區，經不過經年累月供養數目龐大的軍隊，所有糧食早被吃得一幹二淨，山上的樹本也都被伐作工事，蕩然無存了。目下饑民相聚為盜，離城鎮二十里的地方，誰也不敢走近去了。</p>
<p>湖南民性強悍，淪陷後民眾自動組織遊擊隊，少數敵軍入鄉，每被擊殺，所以日寇　恨燒殺特別利害，當集結大軍向小村落進攻，其所到之處夷為平地，尤其對耕牛常以機槍集體殺戮，見農具種子，即加焚毀。故湖南淪陷區之農村，已遭澈底破壞。善後救濟，實為當前急務。</p>

<p>湖南全省在戰前公私立中等以上學校，共有四百多所，如今百分之八十，已毀於炮火中，即未被毀者也已開來缺不全，有了櫈子，沒有桌子。有了桌子，沒有櫈子，估計扮演青年，當在一百萬人以上。</p>
<p>行政院善後救濟總署，雖已答應給湖南十萬噸　粉，但因運輸不能暢通，現已運到的僅僅四千噸。四川省答應供給米二十萬石，江西也允許補助穀二十萬担，然而，到如今一粒也未曾裝到。出席國大的湖南代表，連日向行政院，交通部，經濟部，四聯總處，莎救總署，接洽要求貸款，並增加救濟物資，但很少結果。一位代表很憤慨的對記者說：「湖南老百姓祇有餓死，沒有其他辦法了！」記者聽了，深受感動，慨然答應把湖南嚴重的災情報告給社會各界和全國同胞，我想一定會得到廣大的同情和援助，我堅信湖南千萬難胞是可以得救的。</p>

<p>— 廿三日蚌埠記　通訊員錢夢超</p>
<p>經過七年多　　的蹂躪，使蚌埠　受了嚴重的內傷，復員之後的社會狀況，依然腐敗極端，矛盾　見，綏靖不靖治安未安，表面上雖極力粉飾太平，以不必要的建設來妝點市貌，可是　掩飾不了內在的傷痕。皖北有十包縣被共軍盤踞滋擾，使一般馴良的人民，有居不能安，有業不有樂，逃出來的　集蚌市，在饑餓綫上掙扎。</p>
<p>蚌埠是淮　在皖豫岸最大的運銷市場，但是不幸的很，兩淮大部分的鹽塲，在共軍控制之下不能自由運銷，邊修邊毀的隴海鐵路東段，早已失掉運輸食鹽的效能，因此使蚌埠的鹽業，一落千丈。運商無鹽可運，鹽行無佣可收，鹽業的衰落俗影響鹽稅的收和。　政總局長　秋傑，日前在蚌觀察之後，認為收入短少，由於走私，物就津浦綫南段增設局卡。謂之最後查驗補徵綫，凡未稅之應，限十五日內補繳。此外，並增調大批鹽警，加強津浦沿綫查緝力量，可是淮鹽市價，昨由每担一萬八千元漲至二萬元了</p>
<p>素　鹽糧為大宗的蚌埠，入月以來，兩項均以來源稀少，銷路不暢，而呈呆滯狀態。米呢，因連日受滬市米價陡漲影響，人心惶惶，加以附近各縣俱關糧荒，每市石由七萬而突破九萬大關。小麥登場有日，亦隨之步漲，每市石五萬四千元，有供不應求之勢。米糧這樣的飛漲，地方當局迄無平抑辦法。</p>
<p>米糧飛漲，其他物價亦大大的波動，一般　水階級，莫不　苦連天。各中小學校教師，有向安徽善後救濟分署作救濟的請求，社會上熱心教育的人士，經此間輿論的　示，熱烈展開尊師運動。軍政界聞人踴躍輸將，以作提倡，相信二千萬元的基金，短期間不難湊足。</p>

<p>頃讀貴報登載當局對於本市房荒，短時期內即將以嚴厲辦法對付之，或將與京市同　強迫空屋出租，即規定市民每戶五人，限制住屋二間，六人以上可住三間，最多不得超過四聞，以製裁有空屋而不租者。此項辦法，誠屬賢明之措施。溯自戰事發生以來，本市屋荒嚴重，日甚一日，迫乎最近，解決住屋，　較糧食問題更形困難。蓋糧食無論如何高昂，尚無須以金條為媒介，絕糧斷炊者，究屬無多，而屋荒情形，則使一般　水階級及小市民等，完全處於毫無辦法之狀態中。過去在敵偽時期，偽市政當局曾經迭次布告，嚴　收取頂費，但一紙具文，毫無切實辦法，徒予市民以不良印像。勝利以後，亦未見市政當局採取任何救濟辦法。此次吳　市長蒞任，除對糧價力予抑制外，復進一步　屋荒之解除，實令小市民等不勝雀躍。現時上海房屋，並不缺少，已如貴報所述，計口授屋，一朝實現，頂費惡風，必能自然消滅。筆者於三年前，曾居住於山東省烟台市，該地亦處於日敵鐵蹄之下，房屋恐慌情形，與目前上海正相類似。日人授意地方當局，實行按每人幾方尺　給房屋，有餘者勒令出租。此項消息南經傳佈，情形大異，一般以少數人估居大廈之房東，不特不敢索取頂費，且廣　親友，羅致房客。蓋敵偽軍　，紀律極壞，倘被若輩租用，房東將永無寧日。故祇須正當人士，如肯住人，無不歡迎，房金多少，在所不計，嗣後筆者移來本市，既無金條，又乏　勢。數年以來，所受居住上之痛苦，殆非片言所可聲述。聞常自思，房屋配給，為解決屋荒最合理最有效之辦法。何以市政當局見不及此，忍令全市手無條子之小市民，欲求片瓦之覆面不可得？直到今日，　　　貴報新聞，不禁連呼賢明措置，實　我心。希望當局　斷，毅然進行，祇須有決心，有步驟，成效之來，當如立竿見影，指日可期，決不如平抑米價之困難複雜。至關於房金過低等不合理之處，自亦須設法調整之，俾可逐漸恢復戰前常態。希望　貴報能將　函披露報端。並轉致有關機關參考，以促當局及各佛羅里達人士之注意。　　嚴　房荒，得以迎刃而解。專此即請　安！小市民謹上。</p>

<p>主筆先生：恕我冒昧的直書，希望您能給我產刊載出來。誰都知道，不久的將來，暑假就要到了，我們是一　臨大先修班的學生正在擔憂著將來分發的標準。這並不是我們不用功，不努力，可是，事實即使你是用功努力的話，恐怕將來的分發也成為問題。這不是一件奇怪而矛盾的事吧，決不，主筆先生，請您耐心的讀完它。先修班的水準相差甚大，以最好最劣的比較，簡直可使每個人不能置信，加之各組各科的教授既非一人，於是教材便不統一，還有教授們閱卷的心理不同，於是間憑考分就很難計算標準。譬如說，有一組的教授能諒解同學的苦衷，居然每個人的考分均在八九十分以上，又有一組教授疑心病甚大，於是賜給了一小半同學以鴨蛋，可是事實上並不見得後一組同學的水準羅前一組低，試問，就能單憑分數就能決定分發的標準了嗎？此其一。這次的學期考試，監試的幾位先生過鬆，作弊之風甚熾，若是置身其間的話，真可以說是　為觀止，再問，這考分能作標準嗎？此其二。還有一部份的同學，對於某幾種科目根本就未學過，因為他們在高中就攻專科，而且在大學也預備進專科，可是先修班就在複習的原則下，一律視作學過的，這些同學就吃了大虧，在將來，他們決不會攻讀它，於是，在一定的原則下，他們都遭到了莫大的厄運，因為，分數不夠，要知道分數不夠就很難分發的。此其三。我們惟一的希望，在結業考試的時候，要可能的嚴格，並且要依照學生的志願評定各科的成績，假使有幾科是絕對不需要的話，則不及格的分數，應僅量的予以以通融，因為他們既未學之在前，也決不會再學之在後。賢明的先修班當局，這裏僅將主要的幾點披　於上，作為將來分發標準的參考與建議，一定是很誠意的贊成吧，一　先修班的學生，五月二十六日。</p>

<h3 id="c145">未出世的嬰兒 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 淑莊</p>
<p>本文原載於婦女家庭良伴雜志，再刪減於美國議者文摘內。原文大部根據原著者Amram　Scheinfeld名著「你和遺傳」及其新著「女人和男人」兩書，另又加入其他確實論據與補充。—譯者註。</p>
<p>數千年來做父母的對於他們未出世的孩子往往要問這類的問題，而他們得到的回答常常是錯誤的。科學家們在最近方揭開這人生第一道的秘密，現在做父母的可以得到正確的回答了。</p>
<p>〔一〕有什麼方法使做父母的可以從心所欲得男得女嗎？</p>
<p>不能。嬰兒的性別在受孕的一剎那，着是那兩種型的精子中那一種精子進入到卵子內時就已經決定了。做父母的事先是沒有法子可以做點什麼來決定他們未來的孩兒的性別的。（註：最近的科學研究出男子有兩種精子，一種能生女孩，一種能生男孩，這兩種精子同樣的進入陰道內，他們的比例數人工不能改變。但是通常只有一個精子能進入卵子而成胚胎　所以胎兒的性別要看是那一種的精子進入卵子而決定，以後不能再改變。中國一般人常要怪女人不會生兒子，男人們藉此就可以停妻再娶或納妾，可憐的女人們有苦無處訴，只有怪自己的「肚子不爭氣」。好了，現在新的科學的證明，女人對胎兒的性別是無法負責任的。會不會生兒子倒還是男人自己的事）</p>
<p>〔二〕嬰兒未出世前能預知他的性別嗎？</p>
<p>不能。普通一般的觀念以爲男胎比女胎在腹內踢動得更厲害是不準確的。</p>
<p>〔三〕外國嬰兒將有什麼顏色的眼睛？</p>
<p>若是父母都是有藍色眼睛的，他們的嬰兒多半也是藍眼睛。若是父母間有一方是藍眼睛，他方有藍眼睛的父母兄妹，他們的孩子有一半可能是藍眼睛的。若是父母都是深色眼睛的，可是雙方的親戚中都有藍色眼睛的，那麼在每四個孩子中有一個可能是個藍眼睛的孩子，若是家中完全沒有藍色眼睛的人，那麼孩子的眼睛就一定是深顏色的。</p>
<p>〔四〕孩子是不是更容易像那容貌有特點的父親或母親？</p>
<p>在某些方面是對的。以父母各人方面的容貌來說，那個有更顯明特點的容貌的－如很長的鼻子，很大的耳朶，大的眼睛，長的睫毛等等，是會有很多的機會再在孩子的身上出現。若是那特殊的容貌已經在父母任何一方中，連續傳過幾代，那他們的孩子就有更多的機會也有那特顯的部份。</p>
<p>〔五〕父母雙方都面貌不揚，可有機會生個美麗的孩子？</p>
<p>很有可能。當然，父母雙方長得好看的，孩子也更容易好看。但這也是很可能的，父母雙方面貌不揚，他們可能把那隱藏在體內的遺傳因子傳給這新生的孩子，而能產生出特殊美麗的容貌的。</p>
<p>〔六〕我們常聽到許多的傳說，母親在懷孕時受驚，將來孩子產生後帶有奇怪的記號或缺陷。這種事是眞可能的嗎？</p>
<p>絕對不能。母親的神經系統和胎兒的沒有直接的聯系。母親的思想和經歷不能在孩子身上找出一個代表的符號。只有幻想或偶然的巧遇才支持這個理論。</p>
<p>（七）熱戀中的夫妻所得的孩子是否能有更好的性情？</p>
<p>是。這並不是因遺傳或產前的影響－這只不過是指孩子生在這種環境中可能有更好的性格。</p>
<p>（八）孩子會不會傳繼得他父母間那個有較強的個性者的性格？</p>
<p>不。父母的個性不遺傳給孩子。孩子出世時已帶有父母雙方血統綜合的某種遺傳因子。但是他的性格大多數是由於經騐和訓練中造成的。</p>
<p>（九）只受過很少敎育的父母，他們的孩子會不會比受過高等敎育的父母的孩子要笨些？</p>
<p>不。孩子的智慧不受父母所受的敎育的影響。受過敎育與否，不能改變父母對智慧的遺傳。</p>
<p>（十）丈夫從軍歸來，受有重傷。若有了孩子，會不會有缺陷？</p>
<p>不。只要一個男人能有生殖力，他身體的情況，年齡和健康，不會影響到孩子的遺傳組織。</p>
<p>（十一）男子在年青時得過傳染病，將來他的孩子可有承繼他的病的危險性嗎！</p>
<p>絕對不。凡有細菌的病，不會傳染到孩子的身上，除非母親已經先傳上這種病，那她有可能把細菌傳授到他的胎兒身上，以至孩子生下來就有這種病。假若這個男人的病已經治好，他的孩子不會因爲他的原因而得這種病</p>
<p>（十二）孩子對於母親的血統關係是否比對父親的密切？</p>
<p>不。因爲母親的血一滴也不會直接到孩子身上去的。她的血液先變成無數種的原質，再經過胎盤的歸濾，從　裏胎兒製造他自己的血液。</p>
<p>（十三）生個雙胞胎的可能性有多少？</p>
<p>在每九十個妊娠中，有一個生雙胞胎的機會；每八千中有一個生一胎三子的機會；每七十萬中有一個生一胎四子的機會。</p>
<p>（十四）在一個大的家庭中，最小的孩子是不是常會和頭生長子有很不同的性格？</p>
<p>是。從遺傳學上看，出生的次序並不是一個造成性格不同的因子，只有環境才是的。最小的孩子降生時，做父母的常常是更有閱歷，有更好的環境；同時他又有大的哥哥姊姊的帮助，所以，大家庭中的最小的孩子往往是更早熟，早　，和自主。</p>

<p>— 益</p>
<p>呉市長夫人，最近在接見各報記者的時候，談起當前最重要的工作，就是厲行節約和促進敎育。</p>
<p>關於第一點，市長夫人蒞滬之前，曾經看到各省餓俘的痛苦情形，居住在上海的人，應該厲行節約，共謀救濟，關於第二點敎育是一切建設的先決問題，如果敎育不能普及，那末什麼事都不能進行。</p>
<p>事實上這二件工作，却可從家庭方面入手。家庭中如果能夠厲行節約，間接可以養成一種廉潔的善良風氣。很有許多祗聞享樂的太太，並不曾顧到她丈夫的錢是從那裏得來，利用什麼方法得來的。也很有許多賢明的太太，即使物質享受很差，但能夠造成精神上的快樂，使做丈夫的可以專心在事業上奮鬥。同時家庭主婦，是消費的計劃者和實施者。美國人有一句許，就是主婦是握着全國錢袋的繩子的。所以一個主婦怎樣治家，很可能影響整個國家的經濟機構。現代的主婦，不但要懂得做家事（House　Keeping）更應該負起建設家庭（Home-Making）的責任。</p>
<p>關於敎育的普及方面，從家庭方面入手，也是很合理的辦法。如果以家庭爲單位，把每一個單位中的文盲完全掃除，然後再推行到隣近的家庭裏去，那末在很短的時期中，可以完成掃除文盲的工作。</p>
<p>呉市長夫人，受過現代的敎育，並且隨着市長在歷年以來所担任的市政要職，對於市政的設施，定有很多的心得。從此以後，正可以領導全市婦女界，完成偉大的任務。</p>

<p>這是一件很簡單易做的適歲內孩子穿的小衣。任何輕軟的布料及絨布均可。顏色以淺色素身爲宜。</p>

<p>「跨進烟間，求天拜地；鴉片一挑，歡天喜地；舖上一眠，談天說地；三筒一呼，神氣活現；變弓進來，挺直出去；碰着烟鬼，阿哥兄弟；袋裏無錢，偷羊捉雞；有仔鈔票，再吃三錢。家裏門頭，不必管伊；稱爲烟仙，無憂無慮。可惜近來，烟價橫貴，小本經紀，吃弗連牽；況且政府，決心禁烟；偶不戒烟，監牢裏去；受盡苦頭，毫無話處；想到此刻，還是戒烟。」</p>
<p>這是一首形容吸食鴉片的人，傾家蕩產的歌謠，十分逼真。</p>
<p>在任何家庭中，如果家庭裏有了吸食鴉片的份子，這個家庭，一定不會健全。如今，勝利來臨，政府對於禁烟，具有決心，希望具有烟癮者，快快自新，立下堅決的意志，與萬惡的鴉片，作死殊戰。重新恢復人的生活，創造一個美滿的快樂的家庭。</p>

<p>[Report from our Shenyang office, 29th] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, received a welcome from 100,000 citizen representatives in front of the Shenyang City Government on the morning of the 29th. Additionally, the "National Savior Flag" was presented. The Chairman encouraged the Northeastern compatriots to emulate the national compatriots with the spirit of diligence, thrift, and loyalty to the nation, setting a model role.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The Shenyang welcome rally for Chairman Chiang and his wife, filled with popular joy, was held at 10:00 AM on the 29th in front of the Shenyang City Government. Today, the breeze was gentle, and the sky was clear. From early morning, citizens of the entire city, young and old, assisted each other as they flocked to the City Government Square, all eager to catch a glimpse of the head of state's dignified presence and the First Lady's elegant demeanor. Before 9:00 AM, the square in front of the City Government had already gathered over 100,000 people. National flags fluttered, and music resounded, presenting a harmonious atmosphere. The platform was simply decorated. At 9:15 AM, the Chairman and his wife arrived at the venue by car, greeted by enthusiastic cheers from 300,000 people for over ten minutes. At 10:00 AM sharp, the Chairman and his wife arrived, and the cheers became even more enthusiastic, with people shouting, "Welcome Chairman Chiang, the reviver of the nation!" "Welcome Madame Chiang, who works tirelessly for the country!" "Support Chairman Chiang in completing the National Revolution!" "Support Chairman Chiang in building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People!" The Chairman and his wife were deeply moved by this enthusiastic scene and frequently waved in greeting. At 10:20 AM, the Chairman began his address, and the people stood solemnly, respectfully listening to the Chairman's sincere instructions, which moved everyone. The Chairman's address lasted fifteen minutes, during which the audience applauded nine times. After the address, the Chairman and his wife went to the four corners of the platform and waved to the crowd, at which time the people jumped and cheered, bringing the enthusiastic atmosphere to a peak. Then, the flag presentation ceremony was held. The flag presented to Chairman Chiang and his wife at the welcome rally was named "National Savior." The women's sector presented one named "Meritorious to the Nation," and the China National Salvation Association presented one named "World Great Man." The Chairman and his wife accepted them with smiles and expressed their gratitude. At 11:00 AM, the Chairman and his wife returned to the headquarters by car.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The full text of Chairman Chiang's address to the people of all circles in Shenyang on the 29th is as follows: Northeastern compatriots, today, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have come to the Northeast, which has been occupied for fourteen years, and we are meeting with our Northeastern compatriots in the square in front of the Shenyang City Government under the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. This is the happiest thing in our lives, and it is also the realization of our ideals for the past fourteen years. Our Northeast has been occupied for fourteen years. During these fourteen years, our Northeastern compatriots have suffered the oppression and torment of the enemy and puppets, living the life of slaves and cattle. Our central government and national compatriots have never forgotten this for a single day. Our Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government have led the national compatriots to fight arduously and at the cost of sacrifice for fourteen years. The sole purpose was to recover the lost territory of the Northeast and rescue our Northeastern compatriots. Now our goal has been achieved, and our Northeastern compatriots have been liberated. We should of course express our joy and excitement at this historical achievement. However, at this time of rejoicing and excitement, we must not forget the pain of being invaded and humiliated by foreign races for the past fourteen years, nor must we forget the great sacrifices and losses made by our national compatriots in seeking freedom and independence for the past fourteen years. Therefore, after the restoration of the Northeast today, our Northeastern compatriots must remember the painful lessons of the past, be vigilant and strive, work diligently, cherish ourselves, be self-reliant and strong, defend our own territory, improve our own well-being, and enable our Chinese nation to live freely, independently, and gloriously in the world for generations to come (slight applause). Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have come to the Northeast primarily to express our condolences to our Northeastern compatriots who have suffered for many years, and at the same time to instruct the local government on how to rehabilitate the Northeast (cheers). When meeting with you compatriots today, there are also a few simple points that I would like to offer to everyone. In order to achieve the prosperity and revitalization of the Northeast in the future, our compatriots must all cultivate diligence, advocate thrift, understand etiquette, know integrity, take responsibility, and observe discipline. Everyone, under the leadership of the government, must unite as soldiers and civilians, work together with one heart and one mind, and work hard to build our Northeast. In this way, I believe that in the near future, our Northeast will surely become a model area for the whole country and a proving ground for the Three Principles of the People. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits in heaven of the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the recovery of the Northeast for the past fourteen years. Finally, with the most joyful mood, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang sincerely wish the Northeastern compatriots freedom and liberation to last forever.</p>

<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 29th] The takeover of factories and mines in the Beiping-Tianjin area has gradually gotten on the right track after several adjustments. Except for heavy industry transferred to the Resources Commission for operation, the work of taking over factories and mines received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and transferred from other agencies has been largely completed. More than sixty units of factories and mines have resumed operation. These include coal mines and factories manufacturing chemical industry products and brewing, etc. The first batch of factories is currently being put up for tender, totaling 2,300 units, all of which are operational. There are four coal mines. Except for the Great Wall Coal Mine, which has not resumed operation due to security issues, the coal production of the other three mines is still good. The Kailuan Mine produces 10,000 tons per day, mainly for the Beining Railway and Tianjin industry. The output of Mentougou is still not good, producing 600-700 tons per day, for civilian needs. The Jingxing Mine produces 1,600-1,700 tons per day, mainly for the Pinghan Railway. It can be increased to 2,000 tons per day soon. The issue of management has not yet been resolved. It is possible that it will be jointly operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Hebei Provincial Government. In addition, the North China Iron and Steel Company was a military factory of the enemy and puppets. It currently only produces a small amount of building materials. Also, the North China Vehicle Factory's business is currently limited to repairs and cannot manufacture automobiles.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Chairman and Wife Meet with Families of Martyrs in Shenyang City Hall; Orders Preferential Treatment for Families of Northeastern Soldiers Killed in Action <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] At 10:30 AM on the 29th, President Chiang and his wife went to the auditorium of the Shenyang City Government and summoned more than 200 bereaved families of comrades who were persecuted and martyrs in the northeastern provinces in the past fourteen years to give them words of encouragement, stating: The Northeast has been occupied for fourteen years, and comrades of our party have suffered greatly from the persecution of the enemy and puppets. The central government has been concerned about this at all times. However, at that time, it was limited by the environment and could not provide assistance. Under such dangerous circumstances, the comrades were still able to fight hard. They could not be subdued by force, nor could they be moved by poverty. They were finally able to obtain freedom and light. This tragic and magnificent history can truly represent the great spirit of our party and all patriotic people. Today, I am able to meet with all the comrades in Shenyang after they have gone through many hardships, and I feel infinitely happy in my heart. On behalf of all the comrades of our party, I would like to express my deep condolences. The comrades have endured hardships, taken risks, and achieved success in restoring the country. This spirit of nameless heroes is truly a model for the members of our party and is also what the late Premier hoped of all the comrades. My visit to Shenyang is rushed, and I have not been able to have individual talks with all the comrades and comfort them one by one. However, what our revolutionary party members value is spirit, emotion, and history, not material things and appearances. I sincerely hope that you will carry forward the spirit of the past and strive hard. With the smooth working environment in the future, I believe that your work achievements will be even better than in the past. In short, the revitalization of the Northeast in the future depends on the comrades of our party working together with one heart and one mind, assisting the government, working hard, and striving forward, so that in a few years, the Northeast can become a model for the whole country. After the speech, all those who listened to the instructions were moved and felt inspired, and Party Representative Luo Dayu reported to the President on the struggles and sacrifices of the Northeastern comrades over the years. The President nodded frequently and personally went to the bereaved families of the martyrs with his wife to express condolences, accept their letters of petition, and promised to provide preferential treatment and condolences separately.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] President Chiang recently sent a hand-written note to the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters, stating: "During the fourteen years of the Northeast's occupation, the comrades of our party's underground work, under the oppression and torment of the enemy and puppets, persevered and made repeated efforts to engage in a long-term and arduous struggle with the enemy and puppets. As a result, there were many martyrs and those who were persecuted. This spirit of loyalty, courage, righteousness, and valor is the greatest guarantee for our government to recover the Northeast. Now that the war of resistance has been won and the Northeast has been restored, our party should give preferential treatment and condolences to the families of the martyrs and to the comrades who were persecuted in the past fourteen years and those who were disabled due to their work, in order to encourage loyalty and dedication." The secretariat has already accepted the instructions and formulated measures for the families of the martyrs and the persecuted comrades. The measures were announced in Shenyang today.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] President Chiang is concerned about the families of soldiers killed in action during the War of Resistance and issued a hand-written order to the secretariat of the headquarters, saying: "Over the past fourteen years, there have been many officers and soldiers of the Northeastern nationality in our National Revolutionary Army who were killed in action or went missing during the War of Resistance. Their spirit of sacrificing themselves to serve the country is commendable. Now that the country has been restored, the government should provide preferential treatment and relief to the bereaved families of the martyrs. I hope you will investigate and handle the matter and report it. This is what I hope." It is learned that the secretariat of the headquarters has ordered the formulation of measures for the registration of families of Northeastern officers and soldiers killed in action or missing during the War of Resistance, and a public announcement has been published in the newspaper.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Madame Chiang met with Madame Du Chang and Madame Zhao, wife of the Chief of Staff, in the afternoon of the 29th and gave instructions on the women's movement work in the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Administrative Chief Officer of the Northeast Receiver, Guan Jiyu, Arrives in Shanghai Via a Circuitous Route; Liu Zhe Says Destruction of Buildings in Changchun is a Pity <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Guan Jiyu, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, Yang Chuoan, Mayor of Harbin, and 51 other receiving personnel from each province and city; Liu Zhe, Director of the Changchun Railway Company, Wan Yi, and 6 senior company officials, a total of 62 people, departed from Haishenwai on the Soviet ship Smolny on the 19th of this month, returning to the country via Tokyo, Japan. They arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 29th). The ship berthed in the middle of the river at the customs wharf. Ding Guitang, Deputy General Tax Commissioner of the Customs, upon hearing the news, took a steamboat to the side of the ship to welcome them ashore. The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Foreign Ministry's office in Shanghai sent representatives to the wharf to greet them. It was drizzling, with clouds gathering and scattering from time to time, and the weather was quite cool. Chairman Guan and others were all dressed in autumn attire. Although they had traveled a long distance, they were still in high spirits. After exchanging brief greetings with the welcoming party, they took cars to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>The reporter first met Chairman Guan on the Smolny ship. He looked thinner than when he saw him in Chongqing some time ago. He shook hands with the reporter and chatted with a smile on his face, expressing great pleasure. He first asked about the current situation in Shanghai. After the reporter briefly reported, he then made a statement about his trip, saying: "The government administration receiving personnel of Songjiang, after receiving the order to withdraw with the Soviet army last month, joined with the receiving personnel of Nenjiang and Harbin and rushed to Harbin on the 23rd of last month. On the 25th, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, Yang Chuoan, Mayor of Harbin, and 51 other receiving personnel withdrew from Harbin with the Soviet army. On the 27th, they arrived at Haishenwai and took a boat to Shanghai. After transportation arrangements are finalized, they will rush to Shenyang from Shanghai."</p>
<p>Later, the reporter met Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province. Peng had a full head of white hair and a serene demeanor. The reporter asked about the situation of the Northeast takeover. He expressed many feelings and said: "The takeover work cannot be finished in a short time. However, since receiving the order to withdraw with the Soviet army, our province's security team has suffered 1,300-1,400 casualties up to the time of the withdrawal of the remaining personnel. Both provincial and municipal hospitals are full. There are also 4,000-5,000 people led by Wang Lin, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security Police Headquarters, who are engaged in maritime combat. We are extremely eager for the national army to arrive as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked Director Liu Zhe about the withdrawal of the staff of the China Changchun Railway Company. He said: "On April 28th, Wan Yi and I led eight senior staff members to Harbin by car from Changchun. On the 25th, we took a military vehicle to Haishenwai. On the 27th, we arrived at Vloshilov Station. After getting off the train, we were entertained by the Soviet side and stayed at the seaside sanatorium. On May 18th, we took the Smolny ship via Japan to Shanghai. I have no feelings about this trip, but I heard that 8,000 soldiers and civilians died in the Battle of Changchun, and two large government buildings, one large Overseas Chinese Building, one large real estate corporation building, one Academy of Sciences building, one former Kwantung Army Command building, and one Colonization Association building were burned down, which is a great pity. The construction of these buildings was magnificent, and it is feared that they cannot be restored in a short time. I now plan to go to Nanjing to meet with the President and then decide where to go."</p>
<p>The list of China Changchun Railway and Songjiang Provincial Government officials who arrived in Shanghai yesterday is recorded as follows: China Changchun Railway Liu Zhe, Wan Yi, Liu Shenhua Wu, Liu Chengyao, Zhu Shiming, Chi Yifu, Wang Zubei.</p>
<p>Songjiang Provincial Government Chairman Guan Jiyu, Director of Civil Affairs Shi Lianhang, Director of Construction Wu Shaolin, Committee Member Nao Menghua, Chief of Police Feng, Councilor Wang Xihong, Chief Secretary Zhang Chongyu, Director of Personnel Office Li Jingzhan, Secretary Tian Wenbin, Section Chief Zhao Huailin, Assistant Secretary Liu Yuqing, Section Chief Li Xiangying, Civil Affairs Section Chief Chen Guorui, Section Chief Liu Xibai, Adjutant Junshi.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Yesterday's Central Standing Committee Passed the Reorganization of Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters; Liu Zhenru and Wang Baoxuan Appointed Chairmen Respectively <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 19th] In addition to discussing general routine cases, the Central Standing Committee held a meeting today to continue to conduct a careful study on the issue of downsizing the organization of the Central Party Headquarters. Finally, it was resolved to appoint Wang Baoxuan as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters and Liu Zhenru as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Standing Committee held a meeting in the State Council conference room on the 29th and passed the plan to reorganize the Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters. The chairmen of the Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters were originally concurrently held by the respective provincial chairmen, Li Pinxian and Wang Maogong. They are now relieved of their concurrent posts, and Liu Zhenru will succeed as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters, and Wang Baoxuan will succeed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Minister Peng Tells Foreign Reporters: The Prospect of Peace is Very Bright; The Government Sincerely Hopes that the Communists will Fulfill the Agreements <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of Propaganda held a press conference for foreign reporters at 4:30 PM on the 29th. Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attended and presided over the meeting. The original wording of the questions and answers is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the government's policy on the recent peace talks? What are the government's demands? Does the government's policy coincide with that pointed out in the editorials of the Central Daily News on May 27th and 28th?</p>
<p>Answer: Some aspects of the recent peace talks seem to ignore some basic facts. In order to seek peace and national unity, the government has agreed to some agreements. There are three provisions in these agreements: (1) cessation of conflict, (2) restoration of transportation, and (3) reorganization of the national army and unified编 of the Communist troops. As stipulated in Section 2, Article 2 of the ceasefire order agreement of the National Army on January 10 this year, the conflict stopped (without affecting the movement of the National Government's troops to enter Cambodia in order to restore China's sovereignty or within the territory of the Northeast). The above-mentioned agreements have been announced. The government has no other demands except to require the Communist Party to practice its promises and fulfill the agreements. As for the Central Daily News editorials you mentioned, they quite reflect the government's views and the wishes of the general public.</p>
<p>Question: When will the government and the Communist Party reopen peace talks? When will the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitution Review Group reconvene?</p>
<p>Answer: The government and the Communist Party and other parties maintain constant contact. The date of resumption of the various groups is being consulted for their opinions. I personally believe that if the above-mentioned basic issues can be put into practice, then the issues in the Political Consultative Conference group will be easier to resolve.</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that Chairman Chiang told General Marshall that the cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation are prerequisites for peace talks. Is this news accurate?</p>
<p>Answer: I cannot comment on the correspondence between the Chairman and General Marshall, but if you review the basic agreements I pointed out, the answer will be obvious. The cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation are indeed the first necessary steps to realize national unity. All of this is not a new condition, but only a part of the aforementioned agreement.</p>
<p>Question: Will the National Army advance to take over Harbin and Qiqihar?</p>
<p>Answer: The answer to this question is the same as what I told you at the last press conference. The government's responsibility to take over the entire Northeast is undeniable, but we always wish to achieve a peaceful solution. Yesterday, the Communist Party declared that the Communist army automatically withdrew from畏春 upon the order of Yan'an. I very much hope that they will receive the same Yan'an order to withdraw from other cities.</p>
<p>Question: When will Chairman Chiang return from Shenyang?</p>
<p>Answer: I don't believe the Chairman himself has made a decision.</p>
<p>Question: What is the latest situation regarding the propaganda truce?</p>
<p>Answer: Since Marshal Marshall arrived and issued a statement, we have reiterated our advice to all newspapers across the country: First, avoid publishing unreliable and unimportant conflict news; second, avoid attacks by rumors. You must have seen that this advice from the Ministry has been fully reflected in various newspapers. We will continue to encourage all newspapers to adhere to this policy. We have taken these measures regardless of how the Communist Party decides, and we very much hope that they can do the same. The Communist side suggested that all conflict news should be uniformly released by the mediation enforcement department and its enforcement team. The government found some technical difficulties and could not agree. First: The mediation enforcement department is not comparable to a news agency, and its bulletins must go through review procedures, so it is feared that it will lose its news value due to delays. Second: If news can only be released with the consent of the main party, then its quantity may be very scarce. Third: If only the consent of both parties is required, then the US representative will always be in an extremely difficult position. For the above reasons, the government cannot agree to this suggestion, but we firmly believe that the above-mentioned measures are sufficient to solve the current problem.</p>
<p>Question: Are the current conditions for peace more optimistic than in the following stages? (1) When Marshal Marshall returned to China; (2) When the government recovered Changchun; (3) When the government seemed about to recover the China Changchun Railway.</p>
<p>Answer: It is quite difficult to compare in this way, but I think the prospect of peace is very bright.</p>
<p>Question: What is the latest situation with US loans to China?</p>
<p>Answer: (Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Regarding this matter, I believe you can get better news sources.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Representatives of the Democratic League Met with Various Parties Yesterday <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The Democratic League telegraphed Chairman Chiang today, requesting that he return to Nanjing immediately to conduct peace negotiations. Democratic League representative Zhang Junli also met with Special Envoy Marshall to review the entire situation. Representatives of the Democratic League visited Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, and Wang Shijie this morning.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] After arriving in Nanjing, representatives of the Democratic League immediately met with Communist representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi to review the current situation for three hours.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Hours after the Central News Agency released the news that the National Army occupied the city of Jilin today, Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party stationed in Nanjing, gave a speech, saying that "the situation is in imminent danger." Zhou said: "Chairman Chiang is now stationed in the Northeast, personally presiding over the fire plan. During the Chairman's absence from Nanjing, any effective negotiations to stop the conflict cannot be conducted."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Propaganda Minister Peng Xuepei, when hosting reporters today, said of Zhou Enlai's claim that Chairman Chiang personally commanded the operation in Shenyang: "In my opinion, the Chairman has not been to Shenyang for more than 20 years. This trip is to inspect the local area and comfort the people."</p>
<h3 id="e12">Communist Troops Attack the Central China Railway Line: National Army in Anshan Withdraws to Higher Ground North of the City <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] A telegram from Liaoyang on the 29th reports that over 20,000 communist troops belonging to the 11th Brigade, 13th Brigade, and 1st Brigade of Li Zhenhua's forces, who had been lurking in the Liaoyang area, launched an attack on the Anshan and Tanggangzi stations of the Central China Railway Line on the 24th. The attack was supported by over ten artillery pieces manned by Japanese prisoners of war. Along the way, they engaged in arson, murder, and destruction, setting fire to railway bridges. The National Army units responsible for guarding the stations and bridges were forced to resist in order to carry out their duties, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. The communist forces continued to receive reinforcements from Xiuyan, and they threatened innocent civilians to act as their vanguard. Unable to withstand the enemy's superior numbers, the National Army has withdrawn to higher ground north of Anshan. At the same time, the areas of Dashiqiao and Haicheng are also under siege by the communist forces. As of the time of this dispatch, fighting continues on all fronts. This communist offensive near Anshan is aimed at preventing the National Army from moving north to take over defense duties, with coordinated actions from the north and south. This proves that the claims by communist representative Lu Dingyi and Xinhua News Agency that they would voluntarily withdraw from Changchun are contradictory to their actions.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Ministry of National Defense to be Established on June 1st: Organizational Outline Under Discussion by the National Defense Council; He Yingqin to Preside Over the Strategic Committee <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] According to General He Yingqin, the Military Affairs Commission and the various departments, including the Military Administration, Military Order, Military Training, Political, and Foreign Affairs departments, will be closed by the end of this month. The Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to be established on June 1st without delay. Under the Minister of National Defense, there will be three Vice Ministers, overseeing six departments and three bureaus. A General Staff Headquarters will also be established, with the Chief of General Staff responsible for the national military deployment, reporting directly to the Supreme Commander. Under the Chief of General Staff, there will be three Deputy Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the General Commands of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics. Due to its expanded scope, the Logistics Department will be renamed the Joint Logistics General Command. This organizational law has been submitted to today's meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council for discussion. He also stated that he has been in the military since 1924 and has been away from his home (Zunyi, Guizhou) for over ten years. During his command in Guiyang in the winter of 1945 (when Dushan in southern Guizhou fell, the enemy threatened the region, and all of Guizhou was shaken, He personally went to Guiyang to oversee the battle, turning the tide), he did not have time to return home to sweep the ancestral tombs. After the disbandment of the Army Headquarters, he plans to return to Guizhou for a short rest, but this is not possible at present. It is reported that He will not leave Nanjing in the short term. After the Ministry of National Defense is established, he will preside over the Supreme Strategic Advisory Committee, assisting the head of state in completing the great task of building the army and the nation.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] It is reported that the three Vice Ministers under the Minister of the soon-to-be-established Ministry of National Defense are internally designated as Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and Liu Shiyi (as reported in this newspaper's special dispatch). The three Deputy Chiefs of Staff under the Chief of General Staff are also internally designated as Liu Weizhang, Fan Hanjie, and Guo Chan. It is considered more likely that the four General Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics will be Zhang Fakui, Chen Cheng, Zhou Zhirou, and Huang Zhenqiu, respectively. The candidates for the four Deputy General Commanders are roughly Wang Jun, Zhou Xianzhang, Mao Bangchu, and Duanmu Jie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The 31st meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 29th.

<h3 id="e14">Highway Bureau Strengthens Land Transportation: Slight Changes to Water Transportation Resettlement Plan; Henan Negotiates with Shaanxi to Receive Residents <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 28th] Due to transportation difficulties, 300,000 Henan residents stranded in Shaanxi are unable to return home. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office, accompanied by American officials, went to Shaanxi to offer condolences and is negotiating the reception and transportation arrangements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has recently formulated a land transportation plan for June. The Lianyun Company, using the Shaanxi-Henan road, can transport 12,000 to 15,000 people. The Hunan-Shaanxi Road and the southwest road, from Chongqing to Hengyang, can transport 10,000 to 15,000 people. From Hengyang to Nanjing, 5,000 to 7,500 people can be transported. From Chongqing, through Sichuan, to Changde, and then by small boat to Hankou, 5,000 people can be transported. The land transportation capacity from Chongqing, via Hunan-Shaanxi Road, to Changsha and Ji'an is being calculated and coordinated. The Bureau also plans to expand land transportation from Ji'an to Nanchang. Along the Sichuan-Shaanxi line from Chongqing, the Southwest-Hunan line, and to Hankou and Nanchang, the Bureau and the China Travel Service will jointly establish national reception centers. The journey from the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road to Nanjing includes train travel on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Pukou lines. Therefore, the price is extremely low, only 78,805 yuan per person, plus a 75% discount for the return journey, totaling 129,250 yuan. The price from the Southwest-Hunan-Shaanxi Road directly to Nanjing is 164,650 yuan, plus a 75% discount for the return journey, totaling 287,113.75 yuan. If the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can allocate appropriate materials for transportation on the return journey, this 75% return journey fee can be excluded from the ticket price.</p>
<p>[Additional telegram] Due to unforeseen circumstances, the water transportation resettlement plan for June has undergone slight changes. The original plan included 16 ships for water transportation in June. In addition to transporting grain and government-designated materials, they could carry approximately 10,000 people. Given the urgent need to resettle young people, it has been temporarily decided to allocate the Minxi and Laixi vessels from the 16 ships to transport youth soldiers from Wanxian downstream. Therefore, only 14 ships will transport grain from Chongqing eastward. The originally planned number of people transported eastward from Chongqing via waterways has also been reduced to 8,628. The original distribution ratio was one-fourth each for students, party, government, and military agencies, and others. The resettlement of students has now been changed to account for one-third of the total number, i.e., 2,896 people. Party and government agencies will account for 2,000 people, and the remainder will be for military agencies and other personnel requiring urgent resettlement.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Li Nisheng's Case Concluded in Nanjing: Sentencing Scheduled for 3 PM on June 4th <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Li Nisheng's case was publicly tried today in the Capital High Court. The debate concluded in court, and sentencing is scheduled for 3:00 PM on June 4th. Throughout the public trial, the most profound impression was the unprecedented thoroughness with which Li Nisheng disavowed any culpability for his actions, compared to the countless other major and minor traitors who have been tried across the country. At 3:00 PM, Li Nisheng was escorted to the court from the detention center. After the opening of the trial was announced, Prosecutor He Zhongjin read the main points of the indictment. Presiding Judge Zhu Zhizhi then began the interrogation. In his responses and self-defense, the defendant repeatedly professed that his participation in the puppet organizations was aimed at "loving" Wang Jingwei and dissuading him from taking extreme measures. He claimed that he never voluntarily assumed the posts of Central Executive Committee member and member of the puppet Central Political Council, and that he never actively participated in any plot by the puppet regime to collude with the enemy. As for why he did not prevent Gao and Tao from fleeing, he replied that "they had nothing to do in Chongqing, so it was more beneficial for them to stay in Shanghai and engage with various parties." In his self-promotion, Li Nisheng vigorously emphasized that during his tenure in the puppet Ministry of Justice, he implemented a general amnesty, releasing many patriotic individuals who had been unjustly imprisoned. During his tenure as the puppet Minister of Education, he restored the teaching of party ideology. During his two-month tenure as the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, he refused to visit the Japanese "ambassador" to the puppet regime, Tani Masao, first. He only met with Tani Masao once during his tenure. He concluded by stating that "to accuse him of being a traitor who colluded with the enemy, even in death, he would not be willing." Lawyer Wang Long, appointed by the court as the defense attorney, also exerted himself especially, citing Confucius's principle of not punishing Mengzi as a justification, arguing that the defendant was merely a scholar who did not attach himself to the enemy while serving in the puppet regime, which was understandable.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Taipei, 29th] Today I interviewed Dr. Chen Xingfan, a professor at National Taiwan University. He said that the extraction of levorotatory lodinic acid from cypress essential oil was invented by Professors Chongshengye and Fucinan of National Taiwan University. The former Governor-General funded the research, but it was suspended after the retrocession. Now, under the leadership of Chen, professors from various departments of the National Taiwan University Medical College are working together to continue the research and propagation of its effectiveness. Dr. Chen has drafted a research plan to establish a tuberculosis research institute and sanatorium, and to conduct research in the eight departments of clinical organic chemistry, biology, pathology, anatomy, pharmacy, physiology, and bacteriology. Currently, there is a shortage of effective drugs, with only enough for fourteen people for six months. They are still consulting with the Gaosha Chemical Plant of the Monopoly Bureau, hoping to produce and supply them within three months. Chief Executive Chen has approved a budget of NT$2 million for the project, which will be formally submitted and implemented within a week. According to Chen's investigation in Taiwan, two effective drugs have been discovered, the other being &lt;i&gt;Stephania cepharantha Hayata&lt;/i&gt;, but it has side effects. Cypress oil has a 20% success rate, but the extraction rate is only 0.1%, i.e., 100 tons of cypress oil yields 100 kilograms of lodinic acid, which can treat 1,000 patients for one month. Currently, they are also researching and manufacturing a mixture of &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon citratus&lt;/i&gt;, which is abundant in Taiwan, and two similar geranic acids, which will be more effective. Chen is very determined.</p>

<p>Hefei: County Magistrate of Hanshan Arrested for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Since the provincial government implemented the reform movement, all corruption cases have been seriously investigated. For example, the former county magistrate of Hefei, Long Wugong, who was reported by local gentry, and the former county magistrate of Wuhu, Li Zhicheng, who was found to be corrupt, have both been arrested and handed over to the court for investigation. It has now also been discovered that the county magistrate of Hanshan, Liang Kan, embezzled enemy and puppet materials while serving as county magistrate in Dong. Evidence has been verified, and on the 21st, a team was dispatched to Hefei to detain Liang, who was handed over to the Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<p>An Incident Occurred in the Provincial Assembly Election in Anhui. Lu Shikui, the former speaker of the Hefei County Assembly, was elected as a provincial assemblyman, as previously reported. Now, sixty members of the Hefei County Assembly, including Bao Zhengjie, Wang Gengnian, and Liu Ziqiang, believe that Lu used bribery and is suspected of corruption. After being reported, the provincial government ordered the county to investigate thoroughly, confirming that his reputation was not respected and unanimously expressed their disagreement, advocating for a re-election. They have recently publicly petitioned the provincial government, requesting that they accede to the will of the people and declare their unwavering commitment to achieving their goal. In addition, provincial assemblymen from other counties, including Shi De and four other counties, have been selected and reported to the province. In total, thirty-six counties have completed their elections.</p>
<p>Changshu: Grain Guild Sets Market Price</p>
<p>The local rice price has been fluctuating in recent days, rising from 26,000-27,000 yuan to exceeding 70,000 yuan. After the authorities made strenuous efforts to suppress it, it fell to 45,000 yuan, but on the 26th, it rebounded again. To stabilize the market price, the Grain Industry Guild held a special meeting and decided on a price of 53,000 yuan per stone of ordinary white rice, refusing non-industry personnel from buying and hoarding to benefit the people.</p>
<p>County District Holds Provisional Political Meeting. The county government convened a provisional political meeting to improve the salaries of civil servants and increase work efficiency. It was decided to adjust personnel and eliminate redundant staff. The heads of each department will work with the chief secretary to draft a list and submit it to the county magistrate for approval before the end of the month. Implementation of increased salaries will follow to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Joint Petition Regarding Property Tax</p>
<p>Local businesses and landlords are protesting the county government's proposed "tailor-made" property tax, which would collect 5% of the rental value. Given the decline of the silk industry and the sluggish export market, few properties are being rented. Imposing a property tax would only worsen the situation. On the 27th of this month, the silk industry association held its spring membership meeting and decided that if the government insists on the industry collecting the tax, they would have no choice but to close all their businesses. Over a hundred members collectively went to the county government to petition for exemption but were unsuccessful. The silk merchants are determined and have also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting leniency for agricultural and commercial interests by granting them an exemption.</p>
<p>A Notorious Bandit Who Killed Many is Shot. The local city defense headquarters captured Xie Fu from Xu Jiaqiao in Hua Village, Dongting District, on Qian Street in the city on the 26th.

<p>Hangzhou: Low Silkworm Cocoon Prices Leave Silk Farmers Perplexed</p>
<p>Spring cocoons have already entered the market in Hangzhou. The provincial authorities, aiming to benefit businesses and support farmers, have announced a standard purchasing price of 100,000 yuan per dan. However, due to the exceptionally high price of silkworm feed this year and the scarcity of leaves, which are increasing in price, silkworm farmers have no choice but to bear the burden. The total cost per dan, including the two expenses, is 150,000 yuan. According to the standard price set by the authorities, they are already losing a significant amount. Recently, some businesses have failed to purchase cocoons at the standard price, and some are even lowering the purchase price. Silkworm farmers who travel long distances to sell their cocoons are perplexed and at a loss. They are frustrated and urgently hope that the authorities will send personnel to investigate the purchase situation of businesses to benefit the silkworm farmers.</p>

In the afternoon, he returned to Jiaxing by car and inquired about everything at the County Government and other agencies. He also inspected various middle schools such as Xiuzhou Middle School. In the evening, Speaker Zhang of the Provisional Assembly, along with local figures Huang Tongsheng, and representatives of rural towns, including Xu Shouyi, held a meeting at the Commissioner's Office. During the meeting, they repeatedly expressed the difficulty in purchasing military grain and requested a reduction or exemption, proposing to borrow money to purchase grain and repay it after the new grain is available. Chairman Shen stated that the military grain purchase quota was set by the central government, and the current reduction of 5,000 stone was an exceptional concession and could not be changed. Therefore, a satisfactory solution was not reached. The accompanying staff members also consulted on county administration and provided instructions to Chairman Shen. On the morning of the 28th, Chairman Shen convened county magistrates and others at the Tenth District Commissioner's Office to host an administrative meeting and hear reports from each county on their administration.</p>
<p>Suzhou: High Rice Prices Punished with Fines</p>
<p>The county government investigated twenty-two rice shops, including Hefeng, Tongfa, and Yulongheng, in the city for raising retail rice prices. After verifying the facts on the 23rd of this month, they ordered the responsible persons of those shops to be summoned to the government for interrogation. They confessed to the charges.

<p>Anqing: Supervisory Commissioner's Office Moves to Anqing</p>
<p>The First District Supervisory Commissioner's Office of this province has moved to Anqing because the city has historically been the provincial capital of Anhui, a cultural center, located on the Yangtze River, and densely populated.

<p>In recent days, Chairman Chiang has been making preparations to go on tour in the Northeast. According to a Reuter's Beiping dispatch on the 29th, the Nationalist army, after recovering Changchun, has also captured Jilin, and will soon take Harbin. The situation unfolding in the Northeast is about to clear up, which is gratifying. We cherish the memory of the boundless plains of the Northeast and the open skies of the North Country. Regarding the developing situation in recent months, for the future of the country and the nation, we sincerely present our views amidst our rejoicing.</p>
<p>First, the Northeast is an integral whole. Now that Changchun and Jilin have been announced as recovered, we cannot tolerate any situation where the Northeast becomes specialized. News reports state that if the Communist army abandons its attempt to seize the Northeast by force and voluntarily relinquishes Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places, it may be possible to establish a Communist army defense zone in the western part of Liaoning Province and grant them certain conveniences. Although this is news from reports, and its reliability remains to be verified, we, standing from the position of the country and the nation, do not want to see the Northeast divided. The entire Northeast should be taken over by the National Government and defended by the National Army without question.</p>
<p>Second, since the mission of Marshal Marshall, not only has the domestic situation not improved, but even the achievements made in the past are in danger. We should feel ashamed of this peace envoy. We cannot allow this situation to continue. We must ask why the Agreement on the Cessation of Military Conflicts, the Agreement on the Restoration of Communications, and the Agreement on Integrated National Forces, which were negotiated and signed by all parties, are now being treated as waste paper! If these agreements, solemnly signed by representatives from all sectors of society, cannot be implemented, then future negotiations will be empty words. The Chinese people, after suffering through the hardships of war, desire peace. To satisfy this desire, the government has spared no effort to compromise; however, even after the agreements were reached, the situation of domestic unrest has not been calmed, and transportation remains obstructed, causing suffering to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The facts before our eyes make it clear who bears the responsibility. For the sake of the people and the nation's survival, we hope that the Chinese Communists will demonstrate sincerity in upholding these agreements through their actions.</p>
<p>Now is the time to replace hatred with love, and the phrase "the proletariat has no motherland" has been negated by the two world wars. The Chinese Communists, after all, still say Chinese, and China cannot tolerate any more war. For the sake of the Chinese people, we should replace hatred with love and destruction with cooperation. We pray for the Chinese Communists to turn back.</p>
<p>An Impartial Discussion on the French Military Invasion of Siam</p>
<p>In this restless post-war world, we have recently witnessed conflicts caused by French military invasions. According to a United Press dispatch from Bangkok on the 26th, a report from the Vietnamese-Laotian border states that 800 French troops, along with motorized artillery, crossed the Mekong River five miles southeast of the Vietnamese town of Vietiane and entered Siamese territory, currently engaging in fierce battles with Siamese police and militia. According to the report, the incident broke out last Friday, when the first group of French troops crossed the river five miles southeast of the Vietnamese-occupied area. An hour and a half later, reinforcements arrived, and the French army began to advance eastward, immediately occupying the Siamese town of Long Gei and intending to concentrate their forces to attack Fraratat. The Siamese defense line was forced to retreat ten miles westward. Another Reuters dispatch on the same day also stated that French troops crossed the Mekong River at two points this morning, occupied Thai Bo, and advanced towards Long Gei. The Siamese government has prepared to file a complaint with the United Nations and requested intervention from the British and American governments, intending to seek a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. When the French army invaded, the Siamese police initially resisted but then retreated inland. The French army bombed military installations and reconnoitered inland Siamese territory. According to the above reports, one came from the American news agency and the other from the British news agency. The sources are different, but the facts reported are the same: the French army broke the border and invaded Siamese territory, using airplanes and artillery to bomb Siamese villages and cities. The transmission of this news of armed conflict is truly distressing.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned reports, the French invasion of Siam was initially met with resistance from the police and civilians. However, the Siamese government has filed a complaint with the United Nations and requested intervention from the British and American governments, intending to seek a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. This adoption of a peaceful policy deserves our sympathy. According to yesterday's news report: the British Foreign Office officially announced tonight that Siam has decided to file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to immediately investigate the fact that the French army invaded and attacked Siamese territory. A British Foreign Office spokesman also stated that the British side will definitely place Siam's complaint on the Security Council's agenda. However, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 27th, a message from Bangkok stated that although the Siamese government has accused the French army of invading Siamese territory to the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat has not yet received any reports from the Siamese government regarding the French invasion. According to Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, although Siam is not a member of the United Nations, it has the right to file a complaint if it declares in advance that it accepts the obligation to resolve disputes peacefully as stipulated in the Charter. However, because the United States and Britain will soon propose that Siam join the United Nations, Siam's accusation against France is causing them unease. Therefore, the new dispute between France and Siam may be mediated by the United States and Britain without being placed on the Security Council's agenda. Regardless of whether this dispute between France and Siam will be placed on the Security Council's agenda, or whether it will be mediated by the United States and Britain, we hope that this incident can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. The occurrence of this French military invasion of Siam has evoked the following thoughts:</p>
<p>First, this French-Siamese conflict does not seem to be an isolated incident. According to a France Press dispatch from Saigon on the 27th, French authorities held secret talks with a delegation of Siamese police representatives in April of this year. French authorities demanded that Siam return the Cambodian and Laotian provinces occupied in 1941 to Vietnam. According to a London report on the 27th, these secret talks have been going on for two months, focusing on the Siamese-Vietnamese issue and have completely failed, with the Siamese representatives having left Saigon. The French military crossing of the Mekong River and invading Siamese territory occurred after the failure of these talks, suggesting that their actions are based on the belief that Siam's international position is isolated and weak, seeking to force Siam to comply with the conditions put forward by the French side. The territorial disputes between France and Siam are another matter. Here, we do not want to comment on whether the demands of the French side or the past actions of the Siamese side are justified. But if troops are sent to invade because the conditions cannot be accepted by the other party, or if there is an attempt to coerce the other party into compliance, or if there is an attempt to create a fait accompli of military occupation to gain a favorable position, all of these are illegal acts and should not be tolerated by international morality. In order to ensure lasting peace, we denounce this act of aggression. If there are territorial disputes between countries, they should seek solutions through legitimate channels, and force should never be used arbitrarily. In international relations, we adhere to this principle; otherwise, illegal acts between nations will occur endlessly, threatening the lasting peace of the world.</p>
<p>Second, based on the principle that force should not be used lightly in international relations, we should prevent the occurrence of "border incidents" and confirm that all armed border conflicts are illegal, and those who initiate border incidents should be subject to legal sanctions. Some people believe that this French military invasion of Siam is "nothing more than a 'border incident'" and dismiss it lightly. In the past, border conflicts seemed to be commonplace, such as the "Zhang Gufeng Incident" and the "Lugou Bridge Incident," which were relatively well-known "border incidents." After the Second World War, humanity should condemn these "border incidents." In the post-war world, there should be no more "border incidents." "Border incidents" can escalate from local conflicts to full-scale wars. The traditional view of "border incidents" should be destroyed along with the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs. Therefore, even as a "border incident," we believe that the French military invasion of Siam is inappropriate; because at this time, we cannot allow any more "border incidents" to occur and disrupt the international order.</p>
<p>Third, France, having suffered hardships and trauma in this World War, should have a new sense of awareness. Whether the return of Vietnam to France is wise from the perspective of international justice is another matter that we do not want to discuss. But what international figures hope for from the "Fourth Republic" is that France should have a new self-awareness. The obsolete colonial policies adopted by France in ruling Vietnam, if continued, will inevitably encounter resistance. The French military invasion of Siam, although the truth has not been fully revealed, is undoubtedly another example of these obsolete colonial policies at work. It is due to the implementation of these obsolete colonial policies that "border incidents" such as the current one have occurred. These local events are not acceptable in the middle of a century. However, we hope that the "Fourth Republic" after the war can respond to the new era with new spirit and new methods.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Byrnes Issues Statement Denying Formation of Anti-Soviet Bloc; Answers Molotov's Accusations Point by Point <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes today answered Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's accusations point by point, denying that the United States and Britain have formed an anti-Soviet bloc. Byrnes's response also cited the records of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference as its basis. Regarding Molotov's statement that Byrnes's assertion about the Soviet Union's expression of willingness to help the United States in proposing a four-power twenty-five-year treaty, conditional upon Germany's disarmament, was inaccurate, Byrnes also responded by emphasizing: Molotov at least acknowledged that the Soviet Union would, in principle, agree to this matter.</p>
<p>[United States News, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes today expressed his views at a press conference on Molotov's remarks published in Pravda:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Indeed Agree to a 25-Year Pact</p>
<p>Regarding Stalin's opinion on the Four-Power Twenty-Five-Year Agreement (which was proposed by Byrnes in Paris), Byrnes stated: On September 20, 1945, he discussed this matter with Molotov in London, and at the same time, he brought to Molotov's attention Stalin's remarks in Yalta on the Polish issue. Those remarks stated that Poland had been used twice as a corridor for attacking Russia in the past twenty-five years, and that the United States was at risk of retreating from European affairs and Germany rising again. Byrnes continued: In London, he asked Molotov whether the Soviet Union was willing to sign the Four-Power Twenty-Five-Year Agreement, requesting Molotov to express his opinion. He also stated at the time that the details of the agreement could be drafted. Molotov replied that he could not express the government's opinion, but could forward the plan to the government. Molotov also said that he was very interested in the agreement. On December 24, 1945, he submitted the previous proposal to Stalin through Molotov. Stalin replied that if the proposal was made by Byrnes, he would absolutely support it. On February 14th, he submitted this document to Molotov, along with a memorandum of his own conversation with Molotov. Later, the Soviet Union expressed its approval of the proposal in principle. Byrnes continued: If there were any doubts at the time, Soviet officials could have raised them. In Paris in April, he expressed his willingness to discuss the issue with Molotov. On April 20th, he received a letter from Molotov stating that the Soviet side opposed the draft agreement, but did not mention the issue of Germany's disarmament. Byrnes further stated: Even in Paris, Molotov did not express any doubts about Byrnes's remarks regarding Stalin's opinion. Byrnes said that he immediately requested Lieutenant General Clay, the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Zone in Germany, to instruct the Allied Control Council's Coordinating Committee in Berlin to dispatch representatives to each zone to inspect war factories and individual disarmament. Britain and France agreed to this, but the Soviet government only agreed to the disarmament of troops and did not express agreement to the disarmament of factories. Byrnes believed that it was very important to know whether war weapons were still being manufactured.</p>
<p>Byrnes emphasized that the twenty-five-year disarmament agreement proposed by the United States went beyond a mutual assistance agreement. This method could directly reach the root of war before it breaks out. After Stalin and Molotov understood this point, they very much hoped to establish the agreement.</p>
<p>Byrnes absolutely denied Molotov's mention of an Anglo-American bloc and welcomed opinions from all sides.</p>
<p>U.S. Policy on the Italian Issue Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Regarding the position taken by the United States on the Italian reparations issue, Byrnes said that this matter originated from Truman's report at the Potsdam Conference. To accommodate the Soviet Union's views, the United States had made some concessions on the issue of reparations, but the opinions of the people have not changed. We do not want to help Italy pay reparations with our funds.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, he said that we advocated at the London Conference that they should be governed according to the United Nations Trusteeship System, with neutral administrators in charge. The policy of the United States has not changed to this day. Byrnes said that this move would give the Soviet Union and the United States equal opportunities, and the United States very much hoped that the Soviet Union would agree to this proposal. The United States agreed to France's proposal for Italian trusteeship after obtaining Soviet consent and co-signing an agreement. However, he believed that Italian colonies should declare independence within a certain period. Byrnes said that the United States was willing to discuss issues that had not been agreed upon by the United Nations, and the United States had no intention of changing this desire. The United States was willing to present world problems to world public opinion. "We live in the same world and want to live in the same world." He and Molotov both reached an agreement on the treaty before the convening of the peace conference. Molotov earnestly hoped that governments would study and calmly consider various issues before reaching an agreement, and Byrnes believed that he still held this hope.</p>
<p>Military Bases Are for Security Purposes</p>
<p>Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States' demands for military bases exceeded the scope of security, Byrnes pointed out that in October of last year, before the United States made a proposal to Iceland, the United States had notified the British and Soviet governments in advance that the goal of the United States in borrowing air bases and other military facilities in Iceland was to ensure the security of the United Nations. Byrnes also said that after Iceland joins the United Nations, Iceland should be able to exercise its sovereignty to make the air bases and other military facilities available for the use of the Security Council. The United States had two wishes in this matter: one was the security of the United States itself, and the other was the security of the United Nations. He said that the United States only had 750 non-combat personnel stationed in Iceland. Regarding Stalin's request that Byrnes conduct negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet friendly economic and understanding agreement, Byrnes said that he had not received this request, but diplomatic exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union had indeed discussed loans and other related issues. Regarding this matter, Byrnes said that the United States would propose a treaty on goodwill, commerce, and aviation. Discussing Molotov's statement regarding the costs of Allied occupation in Italy, Byrnes said that the occupation was indeed a major burden on Italy, but he believed that Italy should pay part of the cost of the war. He also said that most of this cost had been offset by our assistance to the Italian people.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Regarding the Peace Treaty Issue, France Stands on the Same Side as Britain and the United States; Bidault Makes Public Statement: French Diplomacy Is Absolutely Independent <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 28th] Regarding the issue of the peace treaty, French Foreign Minister Bidault today publicly stated that France stands on the same side as Britain and the United States in opposing the views of the Soviet Union. Bidault declared: If the Four Foreign Ministers' conference on June 15th does not reach an agreement, he supports submitting the peace treaty issue to the United Nations General Assembly. The plan was originally proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Bidault expressed his hope that Byrnes's proposed "choose one of two" method would not be necessary, and pointed out that some new factors may make the situation clearer before the next conference. But he warned that these new factors must be that the Foreign Ministers return to Paris with the will to reach an agreement, which can promote an agreement. If this can be achieved, the unresolved issues in the last meeting can be resolved.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bidault announced that France will propose a solution to the Trieste port issue to ensure that it is resolved. The reason why the Italian colonies issue has not been agreed upon is due to the attitude taken by the United States. Regarding the German issue, France does not want to divide Germany into eastern and western zones, but wants to separate the Austrian issue from the German issue. France adopts an absolutely independent diplomatic policy, and cannot be bought by the United States or the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Soviet Union Resists Anglo-American Cooperation; Strengthens Southeast European Alliances; Aids Poland and Other Countries to Solidify Friendly Relations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 28th, United Press International] The Soviet Union's move to strengthen its alliance system in Southeast Europe can be regarded as Molotov's explanation of Anglo-American policy as a first step against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is solidifying the Soviet-Polish alliance by providing financial, economic, and military assistance to Poland. This move precisely aligns with Molotov's claim that the Soviet Union will not succumb to the rumored Anglo-American attempt to "impose its will" on the Soviet Union and dominate the world. Polish Prime Minister Osubka-Morawski and Polish Army Commander-in-Chief Zymierski have departed from here to the south, and Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito will arrive in Moscow next, accompanied by the Chief of Staff and Minister of Interior. The Soviet Union can be expected to provide Yugoslavia with the same assistance, aiming to solidify the friendly relations between the two countries and strengthen Yugoslav military strength. The Soviet-Polish agreement has become a model for the Soviet Union's assistance to its allies, and it is predicted that the Soviet Union is prepared to make sacrifices to strengthen its friendly countries. Other steps related to Molotov's statement will occur soon.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 29th] According to reliable sources here: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the invitation of the Polish government and is scheduled to visit Warsaw in the near future.</p>
<p>Also, the delegation led by the Polish President, which visited the Soviet Union, returned to Warsaw from Moscow on the 28th.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Reykjavik, Iceland, 28th] Local authorities announced today that the Soviet Union and Iceland signed their first official trade agreement in Moscow yesterday, stipulating that the Soviet Union will purchase herring, frozen fish, fish oil, etc. from Iceland, and Iceland will buy wood and grain from the Soviet Union. Britain has previously been Iceland's largest buyer of these items.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Iranian Carries Out Two-Faced Diplomacy Under Soviet Pressure; Talks by Leftist Politician <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 28th] An influential Iranian leftist politician, widely predicted to be re-elected in the next parliamentary election, told a United Press International reporter: The Iranian government is deliberately engaged in two-faced diplomacy under intense pressure from the Soviet Union to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing our grain. Regardless of the government's public statements, the Iranian Prime Minister and the Iranian people deeply believe that the course taken by Ambassador Ala in the Security Council is a way to avoid a situation where our country loses its footing. The Soviet Union's influence in our country is clear, and we can only offer passive resistance, that is, resistance with a friendly smile and a reluctant protest.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Pass Restrictions on Romanian Military Strength; Define Disposal Methods for Italian War Materiel <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 28th] According to U.S. official sources: The Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives have passed the Military Committee's report, defining the definition and disposal methods for Italian war surplus materiel. The issue of war criminals in the Italian peace treaty was also raised for discussion, but no conclusion was reached. U.S. Representative Dunn reiterated the proposal of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, advocating that a special United Nations committee should accept accusations within a certain period, such as within ninety days after the signing of the peace treaty. Dunn strongly stated that the United States wanted war criminals to be handled by United Nations agencies, rather than unilaterally. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives also passed a report on the future number of Romanian army personnel, but it must be approved by the Four Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives have agreed that the Romanian army should be limited to what is needed to protect the borders and maintain domestic security.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives are scheduled to continue their meeting tomorrow to discuss the memorandum submitted by Austria regarding the border issue between Austria and Italy. They are also scheduled to hear the opinions of the Austrian representatives on the 30th. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives will continue to discuss the issue on the 31st, and at the same time review the report made by the military experts on the Italian fleet, and the report made by the economic experts on the Italian reparations issue.</p>

<h3 id="e45">French Army Invades Siam; Siam Issues Appeal; Sends Telegrams to United Nations and Four Power Leaders; Lie Does Not Intend to Submit Case to Security Council <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 29th. It is said that a United Nations spokesperson said that United Nations Secretary-General Lie has decided not to submit to the Security Council the complaint issued by Siam regarding the French army's invasion of its territory.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 29th] The Prime Minister of Siam has telegraphed Truman, Attlee, Stalin, Chairman Chiang, United Nations Secretary-General Lie, and Kiernan, conveying information about the French army's invasion of Siam. He stated that the invasion of Siam may affect Siam's food production and requested the world leaders to cooperate and work to restore peace and order in Siam. The Siamese Foreign Minister issued a statement yesterday morning saying that if the French army continues to attack, Siam will be unable to fulfill its important mission. The French army's invasion of Siam should be regarded as a coordinated action that violates Siam's sovereignty. British and American military representatives will go to Siam to investigate the facts and provide reports to their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] It was announced here that the Prime Minister of Siam, Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, has filed a protest to United Nations Secretary-General Lie regarding France's actions against Siam. The Prime Minister said, "On the 26th of this month, the French army crossed the Mekong River and forcibly occupied part of Siamese territory, which is still in their hands. This is a premeditated action against Siam's sovereignty and peace guarantees, and it is hoped that the Secretary-General will cooperate in restoring peace."</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 29th] Siam's complaint to the United Nations against the illegal actions of the French army in Vietnam raises a new problem. This is the first time that a non-member country has appealed to the world peace organization, and there is also a subtle aspect: Siam is a former enemy country, while France is not only a member of the United Nations, but also an ally that fought against the Axis powers.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 29th] According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Yoshida, unable to concurrently hold the position of Foreign Minister, has decided to seek a suitable person to serve as a full-time Foreign Minister. Currently, the liaison work between the Japanese government and the Allied Headquarters is mostly handled by the Foreign Minister, so this position is very important. Liberal Party member Kuni Renkaku, the former Minister of Welfare, was originally one of the most promising candidates, but he has already declined. Yoshida is currently considering selecting one of two people to take over: former Minister to the United States Harada Ken, and former Director of the American Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, Terasaki.</p>

A certain committee member opposed discussing any of these two weapons, but said that they did not doubt their existence. One of them said: "After hearing about the inquiries from the Army scientists in the committee's secret meeting, it is difficult to doubt the existence of such weapons. Of course, the United States should not spend huge sums of money to develop such murder weapons, and then hand over the results to other countries. The results of other countries' experiments do not let people know their secrets." Other committee members said: The Army Department can almost obtain most of its requested 400 million yuan for scientific research, especially focusing on subatomic research.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 28th] Army Secretary Patterson, today speaking at the House Interstate Commerce Committee, supported the abolition of the National Science Foundation proposal.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and immediately met with Mayor Wu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, General Labor Union Zhu Xuefan, and other relevant parties to discuss the general situation of the industrial and commercial sectors and exchanged opinions on the recent surge of labor strikes and the current economic crisis, and discussed countermeasures. At 2:30 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the heads of various industry labor unions at the Queen's Theater and invited Minister Gu and Mayor Wu to give instructions. Those accompanying them included Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs Lu Jingshi, General Labor Union Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau Zhao Banfu, and more than 1,400 representatives from various industry labor unions. The meeting was presided over by Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian. The chairman delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of convening the meeting of heads of labor unions, and then Mayor Wu and Minister Gu gave successive instructions, announcing the central government's labor policies and the guidelines and methods for handling labor strikes, which were extremely earnest and detailed, lasting for two hours. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e65">Mayor Wu's Instructions <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Unstable Labor Strikes - No Different from Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst</p>
<p>Since taking office at the municipal government, I have long wanted to meet with the labor union compatriots in this city because the severity of the food problem poses a serious threat to the lives of the citizens. The entire industry of Shanghai cannot be stabilized, so labor is needed to stabilize food prices and encourage grain merchants to purchase rice, so that rice prices will not rise endlessly. Today, I hope for the following from everyone: (1) Do not think of me as an official, (2) Do not think of me as a rich person. My own income is probably less than yours, so it is more appropriate and intimate for a poor person to speak to poor people. Shanghai is like a big family, I am like the eldest brother, and everyone is like younger brothers. If everyone is happy, then the whole family is happy.</p>
<p>What I am worried about now is everyone's unemployment problem. In another six months, everyone will be at risk of unemployment. Everyone's personal affairs are the affairs of me, the eldest brother. In the past, Shanghai was prosperous because Chinese wages were low and raw materials were cheap. Now wages are high, raw materials are expensive, and the cost of living is higher than that of foreign countries. Take one pound of cotton yarn as an example, the cost in the United States is only 16 U.S. cents, while the cost in Shanghai is 45 U.S. cents. Currently, maritime transportation is not smooth, but in the future, when large quantities of foreign goods are imported, China's entire industry will not be able to compete with them, and they will be unable to operate. At that time, if everyone loses their jobs, how can I, the eldest brother, face everyone?</p>
<p>Currently, labor strikes occur in this city every day, one after another. If this continues, it is no different from forcing factories to close. Therefore, I have invited everyone here today to discuss how to stabilize our lives. At the same time, I have invited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs to announce the central government's policies in order to protect everyone's jobs and stabilize everyone's lives.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Minister Gu's Instructions - Workers' Arbitrary Demands Only Increase Business Crisis <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>In brief: This is my third time coming to Shanghai. The first time was during the surrender, when Commander-in-Chief Tang and Mayor Qian were both in Shanghai. They unanimously ordered the factories that had been closed to distribute three months' salary, set up agencies to provide relief to workers, and urged factories that could resume work to do so. The second time I came to Shanghai, the task was to adjust wages and seek to stabilize the lives of workers, and wage adjustment methods were decided. This is the third time, and I am pleased to learn that the comrades in the labor unions are well organized and that there is a virtuous mayor, which is rare. I would like to express the following opinions for your attention: First, the central and local labor policies are to improve the lives of workers and increase production efficiency. Although this is a policy guideline, it is also in line with the demands of the workers, which I hope you understand. Second, the current economic crisis has several aspects: 1. Shrinking production quality, 2. Increasing production costs, 3. Interrupted transportation, 4. Domestic products cannot compete with foreign goods. These factors are sufficient to affect the national economy, which I hope you also understand. Third, there are also several immature actions of labor: 1. Arbitrary strikes and slowdowns, 2. Threatening other industries to strike and slowdown, 3. Arbitrarily destroying factories or machinery, 4. Using threats against capital, 5. Arbitrarily making excessive and unreasonable demands. These factors directly increase the risk of workers losing their jobs and the pain of their lives, and are sufficient to affect production and construction, social security, and the welfare of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Four Principles Proposed for Handling Labor Strikes <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the government's policy on handling labor strikes, I can say frankly that there are also several aspects: 1. The legitimate interests of workers should be protected, 2. Labor discipline must be rectified, including that workers should abide by factory management and not arbitrarily strike or slowdown. In the event of illegal strikes or slowdowns, or other illegal acts, they will be severely punished according to law. 3. Labor-capital disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures. In any dispute, mediation should first be applied for according to law. If mediation fails, arbitration should be applied for. If one is not satisfied with the arbitration, all major disputes should be subject to the evaluation of the labor-capital evaluation committee. 4. Wage adjustments should be handled in accordance with the prescribed standards, that is, wages should be adjusted in accordance with the cost of living index promulgated by the municipal government, and the wage base should not be changed. If the factory is indeed unable to afford to pay wages according to the cost of living index due to poor production or business, the labor and capital parties should negotiate, or the evaluation committee should agree on a method to reduce and pay wages. Finally, I would like to urge the heads and leaders of the labor unions to pay attention to: 1. The need for correct leadership, 2. The need for sound organization, 3. Improving labor education, 4. Promoting labor welfare, 5. Enhancing labor's self-esteem and self-respect. I also hope that all the workers in Shanghai will show their strength, work hard, improve their lives, and promote welfare in order to improve the status of workers.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Those Who Instigate Labor Strikes Will Be Severely Punished <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>After Minister Gu's instructions, Mayor Wu, with a tone of earnest sincerity, announced the measures for handling labor strikes: 1. Strikes and slowdowns are not allowed, 2. Those who instigate labor strikes will be severely punished, 3. In the event of strikes or slowdowns, no wages will be paid during the strike or slowdown period, and no demands may be made under any name, 4. Those who instigate labor strikes and extract commissions will be severely punished, 5. Laborers should absolutely abide by discipline. I hope that the heads and leaders of the labor unions will pay close attention to the above.</p>

<p>The severity of the disaster in Hunan Province is unprecedented. More than 3.2 million people in Hunan have died from epidemics and starvation. Hunanese in Shanghai He Yaozu, Qin Zhen, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Yuxiang, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Yishu, Li Chongshi, etc., initiated the organization of the Shanghai Hunan Disaster Relief Association. The inaugural meeting of the initiators was held yesterday morning at the New Life Club, and at the same time, the founding meeting was held. Hunan Provincial Senator Fang Dingying, who came to Shanghai two days ago, and Zhang Xiang, representative of the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan, reported on the disaster situation in Hunan. Thirty-five celebrities from all walks of life in the city were immediately appointed as members of the Hunan Disaster Relief Association, and 20 Hunanese in Shanghai were appointed as alternate members.

<p>The case of the Central Bank staff stealing gold bars has involved multiple banks because they had mortgaged the gold bars or had bill discounting relationships with the escaped staff member. The Central Bank Financial Business Inspection Office and other relevant agencies have been intensifying their investigations in recent days. Chongqing Bank manager Zhu Zhifei, who accepted the mortgage of the gold bars, will be handled separately by the judicial authorities for the criminal offense of altering accounts. However, relevant parties are unwilling to make any announcements about the development of the case because it is still under investigation. However, it is fundamentally illegal for banks to accept gold mortgages, so the authorities are thoroughly investigating. As the case becomes more complex, the entire financial community in the city is paying close attention to it. The Central Bank Financial Inspection Office will submit a detailed report to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance after the investigation is completed to request instructions on how to handle the matter. Furthermore, the Qin Tai Silver Shop stated that the previous report that "Yu Shiyang, the owner of the Qin Tai Money Shop, is suspected of receiving stolen goods and has been interrogated" is inconsistent with the facts. Yu is only a staff member of the shop, not the owner, and the incident has nothing to do with the shop.</p>

<p>General Manager Shen of China National Aviation Corporation met with representatives of the aircraft navigation group at Longhua Airport again at 7 PM the night before last to persuade them to resume work. As a result, the communications staff of the group resumed work automatically yesterday. Other parts are still at a standstill. According to the person in charge of the company, a glimmer of hope has appeared in the stalemate, and it is expected that full recovery will be achieved this morning.</p>
<p>In addition, all the staff of the factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai requested to adjust their wages because they were poorly paid and unable to make a living. They sent representatives to the office of the special commissioner of the ministry to request an adjustment of their wages, including three requirements: (1) Wages must be paid according to the cost of living index, (2) If the factories are auctioned or dissolved, three months' severance pay must be paid, (3) Before the wage adjustment problem is resolved, each person should be lent 300,000 yuan first. It is reported that the ministry completely rejected the first requirement, agreed to pay two months' severance pay for the second requirement, and only agreed to lend each person half a month's salary (about 30,000 yuan) for the third requirement. All the staff expressed dissatisfaction and prepared to fight for it.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan for Shanghai Agencies held its eighth routine meeting yesterday morning at the City Government Conference Room in Huashi. Mayor Wu presided, deciding that future housing allocations should be as public as possible, announced at any time, to thoroughly clarify the committee's work to the outside world. Cultural organizations and any individual applicants will only be considered after the central government agencies that must remain in Shanghai have received housing, and if there are remaining houses, they will be allocated at the committee's discretion. At the same time, to prevent abuses in housing allocation, it was decided that all agencies allocated housing must limit it to self-use. If it is discovered that any agency has transferred or sold the housing, the housing will be taken back, the name of the agency will be publicly announced, and the responsible personnel will be handed over to the court for strict punishment, as a warning. According to the person in charge of the committee, the biggest difficulty currently encountered is that the Navy, Air Force, and Logistics Command troops occupy a large number of houses in Shanghai, but the relevant authorities have not yet submitted a detailed inventory for the committee to review. It is reported that the committee has decided to send telegrams to Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng, Director of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou, and Commander-in-Chief of Logistics Huang Zhenqiu, requesting them to appoint responsible persons to participate in the committee's handling of housing matters, in order to vacate houses for allocation to other agencies. It is said that among the current military agencies, the Shanghai Garrison Command under Commander Tang has the strictest discipline over its subordinates. In addition to requesting the committee to recognize the approved 50 houses, all 87 temporarily borrowed houses (including 17 enemy properties) have been listed and reported to the committee, and they will be ordered to vacate them by the end of this month to assist the committee's work.</p>
<p>As for the rumors outside that the committee has issued a large number of permits, there is a misunderstanding. Up to today, the committee has only issued ten permits to the Local Court and one to Prosecutor Du of the High Court, both due to urgent housing needs, and no other permits have been issued. Although the Local Court has permits, the current residents of the houses have not yet moved out, so they cannot move in immediately.</p>

In addition, a batch of 26 criminals recently sentenced to imprisonment by the command but not yet approved, have been transferred to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for detention a few days ago due to the location of the detention center. Mei Gongmei is also among them.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Water Police Branch received a tip at 8 am on the 27th that a woman was carrying drugs to Pudong for sale. Police were dispatched to wait at the Shiliupu Ferry Terminal. Soon, a young woman named Wang Meixian (25 years old, from Pudong) appeared, carrying a net bag containing a small paper package. After inspection, it was discovered that the package contained eighteen pellets of opium disguised as peanut skins. A small packet of heroin was also found on her person. During interrogation, she confessed that the drugs were purchased from the Yang family at 22 Papineau Road, Lüban Road, introduced by Tang Wenxian.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Luo Jingyu, Director of the China Film Studio, recently returned from the United States after inspecting the film industry. A reporter specially visited him to inquire about his impressions of this trip, the current situation of "Shan Zhi" (China Film Studio), and future plans. He said: The film industry has developed to this day and has become a kind of social enterprise. In the United States, there are more than 17,000 cinemas, 8 large film studios, and a total of 21 studios. There are as many as 276 kinds of businesses related to the film industry. The average number of people going to theaters each week is about 90 million. From this number, it can be seen that the film industry is closely related to people's livelihood and economy. In terms of education and propaganda, because films have a lot of contact with the general public, they have undeniable merits. The US has produced more than 10,000 kinds of military education films since the war. The US was able to mobilize 11 million people during the war and complete the training in six months, the merit of film education is worthy of praise. For this reason, the future plans of the studio will focus on the production of military education short films. The development of future work can be advanced in an orderly manner from two aspects: screening and production. In terms of screening, it is planned to establish the Central Military Education Film Museum in Nanjing in the near future. The museum has the nature of a library and will widely collect military education films from all over the world for reference. At the same time, branch museums will be established in various parts of the country to assist the main museum in collecting materials. In terms of production, a military education film studio will be established in the capital this year. The work will be carried out in two ways: one is to translate military education films from all over the world, and the other is to produce films by ourselves, focusing on two points: (A) technical education, including engineering and natural sciences, (B) common sense of social sciences, which will be compiled in the form of documentary films. Luo also said that when he was in the United States, he discussed cooperation methods with the US Time Forward Films Company and the Canadian Government Film Business Administration Office. In the future, they will exchange materials for use by the two countries. The studio will also publish a collection of "Time Forward" films every month. The products that have been finalized include "Goodbye, Chongqing" edited by Tang Xiaodan, "Savage Mountain" (describing the Yunnan-Burma campaign of the National Army), edited by Zheng Junli, "Inflation," "Chinese Navy," "Chinese Water Conservancy," "Chinese Shipping," "American Agriculture," "Today's Xinjiang," and "The Road to Nation-Building." "Goodbye, Chongqing" will be completed soon.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to inquire about the facts of the sale of Broadway Mansions. The bureau made three points: (1) Up to now, the bureau has never proposed to auction the building. All rumors of auctioning are groundless. (2) The building is currently borrowed by the US military. Recently, the Ministry of Propaganda ordered that two floors of the building be allocated for the temporary use of Allied reporters. (3) Although some personnel from the Municipal Government are currently residing in the building, the bureau has no record of it. It is also reported that the bureau has received more than 2,000 enemy property houses of various sizes. About 30 enemy and puppet houses have been seized through secret reports, and about 50 enemy property houses have been received. The estimated value of the above houses is about 100 billion yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rong Desheng, the flour and cotton yarn tycoon, was kidnapped at the entrance of his residence at 210 Gaoun Road on the 25th of last month. It has been more than a month since then. The case caused a sensation at the time, and all sectors paid close attention to it. Yesterday, this newspaper obtained confirmation that Rong had returned to his residence safely the night before. There are various rumors about how he escaped. One said that his family paid a huge ransom to the kidnappers. The reporter went to his residence to inquire about the circumstances of his escape, but Rong himself and his sons all avoided meeting, so whether it was a "ransom" or not, his family members remained silent. Another said that after Rong was kidnapped on the 25th of last month, the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau considered the case to be of great importance, and both sides devoted all their efforts to the investigation and dispatched a large number of officers to step up the search in order to solve the case as soon as possible. The bandits, seeing that the situation was becoming increasingly tight and knowing that it was difficult to hide, released him at midnight on the 28th. It is reported that Rong was confined in the bandit's den for 35 days. Because he is over seventy years old, he looks a little thin. It is said that he will go to another port for recuperation in the near future.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the president of the court came to Shanghai to inspect the high and local courts, the authorities have stepped up the implementation of the integrity campaign. Cheng Zhaopeng (from Anhui), the warden of the Detention Center of the Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, was recently dismissed for "running strips." "Running strips" is their slang, which means using the convenience of their position to extort money from the families of prisoners. All advances of money to prisoners must be registered with the detention center authorities and cannot be used casually. Therefore, some prisoners asked Cheng to privately solicit money from their families and buy all kinds of food items on their behalf. Cheng took this opportunity to make a profit and was eventually investigated by the authorities and immediately dismissed. Cheng was still unwilling to give up and still solicited a wristwatch from the family of Chu Benfan, a opium addict (who runs a clock shop). The Local Court found out about it and has ordered an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Chen Bofan Under Trial; Serving in "Underground Work" Even if Not False Does Not Affect the Establishment of a Crime; Shelley Chewing Gum; Walks into Court with His Head High; His Attitude Remains Arrogant <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Starting at 10 am yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court separately tried four cases of treason, presided over by President Xiao Xie and Prosecutor Cao Ju. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Bofan, a native of Shanghai, 47 years old, graduated from the Department of Law of Japan University. Before the war, he operated matches and served as the chairman of Shanghai Great China Match Co., Ltd. In 1940, he also served as the puppet minister without portfolio. In February 1945, he served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan. In 1941, he was transferred to the puppet Embassy in Japan as a counselor and committee member, etc. After being arrested by the Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau, he was sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Chen confessed to the facts listed, and claimed that he had assisted in the war of resistance and provided our side with enemy and puppet economic intelligence, etc. The prosecutor believed that although the Military Statistics Bureau had sent a letter stating that the defendant was serving in an organization, it was not false, and it could be used as a reference for sentencing, but it did not affect the establishment of a crime, and filed a public prosecution according to law. During yesterday's interrogation, the defense lawyer stated that the witnesses Huang Kefu and Chen Zukang had not appeared in court, and requested a retrial to summon the witnesses. The court ordered a change of date for the trial.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiliang, a native of Shanghai, 41 years old, had colluded with the Japanese Zhugu Jiangbo, and the enemy naval attache Hino. At the beginning of 1944, he was recruited by Hino to serve as a special agent in an organization under the enemy naval attache's office, providing information. In April of the same year, he was transferred to the puppet Huangpu Police Branch as a plainclothes police chief of the Special High Section. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. When Zhang was brought to trial yesterday, he stood in the defendant's column, lowering his voice and trying to pretend to be a pitiful bug, trying to cover up his bloody crimes with the words "forced by life".</p>
<p>Hua Zhensheng and Gu Wenhua, during the enemy and puppet period, Ye served as the chief of the 50th Baojia of the enemy navy, and Gu served as the chief of the 55th Baojia. At 9 pm on July 26, 1944, the two of them, together with Gan Maotou, the secretary of the Hongzhen Baojia Office, went to Cao Baoru's house at 12 Hexing Lane, Zhangjia Lane. Because the extortion was unsuccessful, Ye and Gan started beating him and dragged Cao to Gu Wenhua's place at 88 Zhangjia Lane. Gan then committed murder, causing Cao to die from serious injuries. Later, Cao's relative Li Zongtang complained to the puppet court, which acquitted them. Recently, they complained to the authorities again. The High Prosecutor's Office confirmed the autopsy was true, and the defendants were all employed in puppet organizations, so they were prosecuted on charges of treason. Except for Gan Maotou, who is at large, both defendants Ye and Gu have been interrogated once, and a retrial has been ordered.</p>
<p>Ye Yaoxian, a native of Suichang, Zhejiang, 32 years old, is the nephew of Li Shiqun. In September 1939, he was introduced by Li to serve as the chief of the document section of the General Affairs Office of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters. In July 1940, he was promoted to the director of the puppet General Affairs Office of the headquarters. In 1942, he also served as the manager of the puppet Jiangsu Bank. During his tenure in various puppet positions, he harmed underground workers of the Central Government and investigated military, political, and economic news. During yesterday's interrogation, Ye still tried to deny it.</p>
<p>Also, the case of Shelley, the former deputy chief patrolman and political director of the French Concession Police Department, and Aminov, who used to work for the enemy gendarmerie on Baidang Road, jointly communicating with the enemy, was continued yesterday afternoon by Prosecutor Cao Jun in the First Criminal Court. The defendant was defended by lawyers Yan Zhenlin and Yao Zhao. When Shelley entered the court, he strode in with his head held high, chewing gum in his mouth. He walked straight to the defendant's column before slightly bowing to the judge to show his respect. After Prosecutor Cao asked some questions briefly, he summoned witnesses Juri Ai, Santo Yang, Shawi, and Mono. Shelley and Aminov sat aside to rest, still chewing gum. Aminov also asked him for food. The two crossed their legs and looked arrogant, as if they were watching a play in a theater. The witnesses who were summoned were all colleagues of the defendants, and their words were all in favor of the defendants. Finally, lawyer Yao requested the court to view all the files on Shelley in the French Consulate. Prosecutor Cao declared that it still needed to be considered and ordered a change of date for the trial.</p>

<h3 id="e87">A Love Triangle Murder Case in Yunnan South Road <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>A Ningbo woman named Miao, 34 years old, remarried Wang Dasang (45 years old), a fellow townsman, after her husband died, and gave birth to a son named Wang Baogen, 15 years old. Eight years ago, Wang was unable to support Miao, and they separated. Later, Wang served as an employee of a Japanese ship. When the war broke out, the ship was detained in the UK, and Wang stayed in the UK. After Miao separated from Wang, she married another fellow townsman, Lu Zisheng (36 years old, ship business), and lived together in a tongxiang room on the second floor of 3 Yuqing Lane, Yunnan South Road. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Wang Dasang returned to China in February of this year. After arriving in Shanghai, he missed his old love in boredom and visited Miao. He lingered for more than a month. At that time, Lu happened to return to his hometown for something, so no accident happened. Miao said to Wang: "I have been separated from you for many years, and I have another partner now. Please don't come to my place in the future to avoid any problems." Wang left in anger, but Wang came back two weeks later and stayed for two days. Taking advantage of the unprepared Miao, he stole 560,000 yuan in cash and fled. Miao found out, but she did not pursue it out of consideration for their past relationship. But at 5 am yesterday morning, Wang Dasang suddenly came again and broke into the room. At that time, Miao and Lu Zisheng were fast asleep. Wang immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed Miao's vagina first, then repeatedly stabbed her buttocks and right arm four times. Lu saw this and shouted for help and tried to snatch the knife, but Wang stabbed Lu's left hand and then stabbed his ribs, both of them were seriously injured, lying on the bed, bleeding profusely. The murderer saw that his goal had been achieved and ran away without a trace. After receiving the report, the police station sent the two injured to the hospital and hunted down the murderer.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Celebrating the Motherland's Longevity: South China's Premier Legal Institution – Fujian College <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yunqiu</p>
<p>Law students often admire Chaoyang University in Beijing and Soochow University in Suzhou, for their long histories and numerous alumni. Little do they know that in the southern part of the country, in Fujian, there is also a legal school with a long history and many alumni – the present Fujian College in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Fujian College in Fuzhou has long been known in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as "the Chaoyang University of the South".  The school came into being after the National Revolutionary Army liberated Fujian.  Initially, it was reportedly called "Political and Legal Academy," later changed to "Fujian College of Political Science and Law," and finally took its current name in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). There were also many changes in its organization during this time.  It initially only had a law department, later adding political science, and then economics in the 18th year of the Republic (1929). (In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], an agricultural college was added with the intention of expanding into "Fujian University," but the plan failed after only half a year of preparation. The agricultural college then became an independent institution and is currently one of Fujian Province's two provincial medical and agricultural colleges.)  To date, its history spans a full thirty-five years.  It is difficult to get an accurate number of the total alumni at the moment, but to give an example, over half of the county magistrates in Fujian's sixty-four counties, forty percent of the senators, and ninety percent of the judges are graduates of the college.  Given "similar connections" in other departments, the actual number is undoubtedly higher.  The establishment and growth of a private school is partly due to the board of directors and partly due to the support of alumni.  Under this "dual approach," Fujian College was not only unharmed during the eight years of the War of Resistance, but also became even more prosperous. During the war, it moved to Liudu in Minhou, and then to Baiyundu. During these relocations, school buildings, transportation, staff and student dormitories, meals, and so on were almost entirely provided by alumni from various regions. Alumni also competed to find solutions for the college's students' career prospects.  This shows that the solidarity, love, mutual assistance, and mutual support among the students are admirable. Last year, before the end of the war, as soon as Fuzhou was recovered, the entire student body clamored to "return to Fuzhou," and the faculty also agreed, and the move began in July. As a result, Fujian College became one of the first universities in the country to resume operations.  The Suzhou campus is located in the Baishui Jing area in the south of the city.  It lacks the noisy air of the city center, but is close to the countryside and has a rural flavor. Behind the campus is the scenic Niaoshi Mountain, and next door is the Higher Court, which is quite spacious and imposing. This semester, Fujian Normal School moved to the mountain above, and the medical college moved to the Li family ancestral hall, a few hundred steps away. It seems that the Baishui Jing area will become Fuzhou's "university district". Of course, the students of Fujian College warmly welcome their arrival.</p>
<p>The college still has its three original departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics.  This semester, it also has new Judicial and Banking groups, and it seems likely to expand into a college of law and business in the future.  The president, Mr. Guo Mu, has expressed his desire to turn it into a university, which is probably possible. The Law Department has the most students.  The total number of students in the college is now over five hundred. Too many students were admitted to the lower grades, resulting in over two hundred students in three classes, which is rare in universities in China. The faculty here is also the strongest in the Law Department, with many alumni and some foreign teachers, all with acceptable academic qualifications.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to introduce two distinctive features of the college: First, the library has a large collection of books. The Fujian College Library is the famous Niaoshi Mountain Library in Fuzhou, located under the wings of Fushan near the college headquarters. It is a huge building made entirely of reinforced concrete, consisting of two Western-style buildings. The first floor is used exclusively as a reading room and for students' evening self-study. The second floor is entirely a "book storage," and the third floor is a large drying platform, which can be used for cooling off on summer evenings and for reading while overlooking the Fuzhou night market. The entire collection of books includes 60,000 volumes of ancient books and approximately 50,000 volumes of modern editions. There are also plenty of new books and old magazines. In terms of quantity, it is said to be third in the province after Xiamen University and Union College. However, in terms of literature and law books, the college leads the province. The second distinctive feature is that the college's affiliated middle school has achieved remarkable results, with a student body of over 1,300 in both the senior and junior high school divisions. Since moving to Fuzhou, the school's progress has been even faster. The principal of the affiliated middle school is Lin Hongqi, and the director of discipline is Chen Guangzu, known for his "iron face." The school has a total of seventeen or eighteen classes, and the lower grades are particularly crowded, perhaps due to the more lenient entrance examination standards of private schools.</p>
<p>When National Linsen University was being planned, it was intended to include Fujian College, but the alumni unanimously opposed it. The only reason was that they "did not want to change the name of the college".  It seems that this college has a strong sense of confidence. With a long history and deep roots, it is naturally difficult to shake it!</p>

<p>(1) Zhou Chenghua asks: I am from Wuhu. After the war, government agencies withdrew to Sichuan. My father is old and unwilling to leave his hometown. Our family owns more than twenty rooms. My father lives in a few himself, and the rest are rented to relatives and friends. After my hometown fell, my father initially had extra money, but due to the prolonged war, he was heavily in debt. He was forced to sell all the houses in the thirty-third year of the Republic (1944). The buyer took advantage of my father's distress and deliberately lowered the price. My father reluctantly sold them and signed a sales contract, which was notarized. Since then, the education and marriage expenses of my younger siblings have been unfunded, and even my father's living, death, and burial expenses are lacking. I wonder whether the sales contract made under the puppet regime is valid?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanben Kai]: Unless forced by the power of the enemy and puppets, the sales contract cannot be considered invalid. Your letter states that the sale was due to family poverty, so it was voluntary, and there is no claim for damages.</p>
<p>(2) Bei asks: I heard that Mr. Cao Tingzhang inquired about the pre-war mortgage of real estate in your newspaper. Lawyer Duanmu replied: "Handle pre-war debts and deposits in the same way, referring to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Procedure after Repatriation," etc. However, I do not know how to interpret the permanent provisions? The matter about the enemy is the same as Mr. Cao, please disclose it in the newspaper, I will be very grateful.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanben Kai]: The "legal act" mentioned in that article refers to all contracts, including borrowing.</p>
<p>(3) Suzhou Ying asks: I bought several acres of farmland before the War of Resistance and signed a contract. The seller borrowed money from me twice before and after selling his farmland. However, the latter was repaid with interest last year after the victory. However, according to local customs, when signing a contract for the sale of property, an additional "persuasion loan" must be added at one-tenth of the value. I have several questions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Are there any legal regulations for this type of additional persuasion loan contract? (2) If there are regulations, can the loan receipts for silver dollars before the establishment of the sales contract be used as evidence? (3) Is it still valid to date? (4) If the seller uses various methods to demand or force the establishment of a persuasion loan, can I sue the court to protect the people's property?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanben Kai]: (1) (2) There are no legal regulations. (3) The meaning of the words is unclear. (4) You can seek relief through litigation.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Increased Supply, Slow Consumption: Rice Prices Continue to Fall. Oil, Beans, and Grains All Weak. Distribution of Cooking Oil Ends Today. <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market experienced slow consumption. Both Japonica rice and Keng rice fell by a small amount per thousand. Although Baiyuan and Yangjian goods were scarce, the influx of Japonica rice and Keng rice was not as strong, but the market was also weak, and prices softened. The flour market was sluggish, and the new wheat harvest was approaching, so the market weakened and fell another 500-600 yuan. Soybean consumption was also slow. It was rumored that soybeans were being shipped from Europe and the United States, causing market sentiment to soften and prices to fall sharply by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Many people wanted to sell soybean cakes, but buyers were cautious, so prices gradually declined, falling sharply by 600-700 yuan. Bran transactions were scarce, with neither gain nor loss. Peanut kernels were weak, with prices falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Wheat transactions were still sluggish, and red sorghum sales were stagnant, with prices falling another 2,000 yuan. Mung beans fell slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The corn market was hesitant in the morning, but livened up at noon due to developments in Qingdao, and prices rose by more than 1,000 yuan. There was a large supply of oil from various sources. Recently, supplies from Henan Province had been arriving continuously, creating a strong atmosphere and causing prices to fall steadily, dropping another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Since the China Vegetable Oil Factory began distributing vegetable oil, it has distributed a total of 30,000 dan to date. It is said that due to the abundant inventory in the city, distribution will be temporarily suspended starting today.

<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram reported that overseas textile merchants were buying in large quantities, causing a sharp increase of 23 to 27 basis points. Intermediate positions even rose by 43 basis points. The near-term price of American cotton was US$27.98, the far-term price was US$28.56, and the spot price of middling cotton was US$28.60. Trading in spot cotton in Shanghai was active.

<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was affected by the upcoming opening of goods by China Textile Corporation today, so prices were slightly lower than the previous day by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The opening price for spot goods of the No. 120 Tianqiao brand was 1.32-1.33 million yuan, but trading was scarce, and prices did not change throughout the day. Prices for other miscellaneous brands fell by 10,000-20,000 to 30,000-40,000 yuan. Silk factory prices did not change. There were no transactions in foreign company goods. Users' silk was also very quiet. The price of Qianjing silk was lower than the previous day by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Due to cost factors, manufacturers were unwilling to sell silk fabrics at low prices, and market prices were steady. The price of Mei Ya bed sheets was 1.3 million yuan in the morning, and the price of Dachen checkered fabrics was 4,150 yuan per yard, which was 100 yuan stronger than the previous day.

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated narrowly. The 20-count yarns of various brands did not see any activity due to extremely sluggish demand from the Canton-Hankou and Tianjin areas. However, prices did not fall as a result, because the supply of spot goods from various factories was not abundant either. There were not many 42-count double-stranded threads available, and there were people looking for them, causing prices to rise by 20,000-30,000 yuan again. At noon, Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn sales as usual, offering two types of 20-count yarn, Liuma and Yunpeng, but there was not enough to meet demand. However, the opening prices for 60-count and finer yarns were significantly higher than the previous period, by a large margin of 100,000 to 500,000 yuan. It was reported that there were another 11 types of coarse and fine yarns and threads being sold through bidding.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth situation remained stable and quiet. Factories were in strong demand for grey cloth, and purchases from the northern gang were also not weak. Buyers from Sichuan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Henan, and other places were very keen on finding spot goods for the winter season, so colored cloth was particularly expensive, and market prices rose by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The market in the afternoon was not much different from the morning. The Four Gentlemen's broadcloth and V-Dragonhead fabrics continued to trend upwards.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks were affected by the sale of yarn in Canton and by the exit of some participants in the financial sector. Yesterday, the market was uninspired, and the situation appeared tired.

The veteran stocks were mediocre with little change. In the afternoon, Yongsha was quoted at 5,750 yuan, Meiya at 4,450 yuan, and Jingfu was flat. The situation for foreign stocks was bleak. They were initially exhausted and then flat. Only Yisha was the hottest, rising from 2,800 yuan to 12,400 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The final result was that Yisha was uniquely stable due to the small number of transactions. The rest were all slightly weaker.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Main Reason for the Food Shortage Is the Rice Shortage. The Rice Shortage Is Most Severe in China. This Year's Western Hemisphere Has a Relatively Good Harvest. <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 28th] According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Office, the world's sales of rice from 1945 to 1946 amounted to only 6.2 billion bushels. In comparison, the market sold 6.8 billion bushels last year. The average number for the five years from 1935-36 to 1939-40 was 7.4 billion bushels. The reason for the rice crop failure is not only that planting and harvesting were hindered by the war, but also that some countries were affected by drought. The most severely affected area is Asia. Europe's harvest has also been drastically reduced. However, the production in the Western Hemisphere, stimulated by world demand and also due to favorable weather, has set an unprecedented record high. Africa's output is also unprecedented. Rice is the main food for half of the world's population, so the rice production shortage from 1945 to 1946 is the main factor in the current world food shortage. It is generally estimated that only 2 to 4 billion pounds of rice will be available for export in the world in 1946. The shortage in Asia is 40 billion pounds. Before the war, most of the world's imported rice came from Eastern countries. These countries imported an average of 16 billion pounds per year. The small amount of rice available for export this year comes from the production in the Western Hemisphere from 1945 to 1946 and the old rice surpluses remaining in the surplus areas in the East before the war. The Western Hemisphere can export between 600 million and 800 million pounds of rice in 1946. The place with the most severe rice shortage is China, where pre-war production accounted for 35% of the world's total. It is estimated that China's harvest from 1945 to 1946 will be at least 460 million bushels short compared to the pre-war production of 2.62 billion bushels. Even in years of good harvest, China needs to import an average of nearly 800 million pounds of rice from abroad each year. Compared to the large shortage this year, the amount of rice that China can expect to import this year is very limited. Other countries with particularly severe rice shortages are India, Japan, the Philippines, Ceylon, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p>Prices for Over 10,000 Bags Remain Original</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to the second sale of medium and white sugar by the Taiwan Company, and downstream sales continued. The guild's allotment price for spot medium and white sugar was initially 72,500 yuan, and then 72,000 yuan to 71,500 yuan, a small decrease of 1,000 yuan. The price for double bags was 71,000 yuan due to the need to account for the loss of the bag skin. The Taiwan Company sold a total of more than 13,000 bags. The price was announced at about 4 PM, still 66,000 yuan, delivery at the pier, payment on the 31st, payable by check, directly to the Bank of China.

<h3 id="e127">Director Zou Jingheng of the Chinese Silk Technology Department Discusses: The Looming Crisis in the Silk Industry; High Grain Prices; Lack of Talent <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] According to Mr. Zou Jingheng, Director of the Technology Department of the China Silk Corporation, the current state of the silk industry gives cause for anxiety about its future in our country. The current crisis in the silk industry mainly stems from: (1) High Grain Prices: Silkworm farmers calculate based on the ratio between cocoon prices and grain prices. Currently, it is roughly three *dan* of rice for one *dan* of fresh cocoons. If it falls below this ratio, farmers would rather uproot mulberry trees and convert the land into fields for other crops. Once mulberry trees are uprooted, it takes at least five years for new cultivation to yield a useful harvest. Moreover, labor costs are also rising due to high grain prices, making it difficult to reduce production costs. (2) The imbalanced proportion of increased production costs to raw material costs. Coal prices, for instance, have increased 16,000-fold compared to pre-war levels, while silk prices have only increased 2,300-fold. Before the war, production costs accounted for 20% of the cost of producing one *dan* of silk, while raw material costs (cocoon prices) accounted for 80%. In other words, silkworm farmers received 80% of the revenue. Currently, although each *dan* of raw silk sells for 2.3 million yuan, manufacturing costs account for one million yuan, leaving only 1.3 million yuan for the silkworm farmers. Furthermore, four *dan* of dry cocoons are required to produce one *dan* of raw silk, and it takes three *dan* of fresh cocoons to bake one *dan* of dry cocoons. Based on this ratio, each *dan* of dry cocoons is worth only slightly more than 100,000 yuan, which is 50% less than the price ratio of three *dan* of rice for one *dan* of fresh cocoons. Silkworm farmers feel this is insufficient to cover costs, but if the cocoon purchasing authorities were to purchase cocoons at this price, they would still suffer losses based on the current raw silk prices. (3) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, both silk production technology and talent in our country declined. Therefore, much of the silk produced does not meet standards, and it is difficult to recruit specialists. (4) External Threats: (A) The rise of synthetic silk substitutes, such as nylon, which was used extensively in the United States during the war to manufacture stockings due to a shortage of raw silk. Currently, nylon stockings account for 75% of all stockings produced. While it is said that raw silk use will resume on a large scale after the war, if raw silk prices are too high, the percentage of raw silk being used will not be very high. (B) The recovery of the Japanese silk industry. General MacArthur has allowed Japan to restore light industry, with the food industry taking precedence, followed by the silk industry. The production costs of the Japanese silk industry have not changed drastically from pre-war levels. Therefore, the conditions for the recovery of the Japanese silk industry are better than in our country. General MacArthur's actions are aimed at solving the livelihood of the Japanese people, but it is also hoped that the recovery of our country's silk industry will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been reported that the China Silk Corporation has begun to purchase cocoons in the silk-producing regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces starting on the 23rd of this month. The purchases are divided into four districts: Hao County in Anhui Province, Jiaxing and Changan in Zhejiang Province, Wujiang and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, and Wuxi, Changzhou, and Liyang. A total of 58 cocoon businesses are operating in these districts, with an estimated purchase volume of over 8,000 *dan* of fresh cocoons. It is said that the purchases should be completed around the 6th of next month.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] The British Ministry of Food has announced that price controls on exported food, soap, and animal feed have been lifted. The types and quantities of exported goods will not be affected. Furthermore, exporters are allowed to adjust packaging and shipping costs to obtain better prices when selling abroad and to generate profits.</p>

<p>Recently, due to lower prices abroad and excessively high domestic production costs, imports have doubled in the past three months, while exports have been meager. People in the industrial and commercial sectors are calling for a longer foreign exchange retention period or effective incentives for exporters to increase exports. It is reported that the authorities are sympathetic to these suggestions, but because foreign exchange policy is determined by the highest central authorities, it is not yet the time to change policies. Therefore, to encourage exports, the Central Bank has remedial measures for export exchange settlements, allowing exporters to apply for exchange settlements at the Bank of China with two telegrams from foreign sales. The Bank of China will first lend the equivalent value of the goods based on these supporting documents, calculated at a weekly interest rate of 0.5%, to facilitate the operational capital for exporting goods. As for the industrial sector's request to extend the foreign exchange settlement period, the authorities feel that the extension period is too long, making it difficult to review. To facilitate the industrial sector in ordering machinery and raw materials from abroad, industrial enterprises are allowed to purchase our country's private deposits in the United States or pay with some U.S. dollars.</p>

As for sales to the United States, there has been no progress. Local sales of assorted teas to local stores and visiting merchants continue unabated, but sellers also continue to sell off their stock.

<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Wings of Freedom</p>
<p>On April 28th, Major Rick, the military attaché, was scheduled to take off in the morning, but the flight was repeatedly delayed due to gasoline issues. In the afternoon, everyone was listless and sleeping. While napping, Major Rick suddenly called out to Shixun: "Someone is talking downstairs." When he went downstairs, he saw a young communist soldier in a yellow uniform. The soldier politely approached and asked, "Are you Mr. Zhao?" Shixun replied, "I am. May I ask your name?" The soldier introduced himself as Liu Ke and handed over a letter from Zhou Baozhong to us:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Shixun and Major Rick: I hereby introduce my secretary, Comrade Liu Ke. In the future, all matters concerning Major Rick's gasoline, as well as outings for the Chinese and American reporters, can be handled through Comrade Liu." Zhou Baozhong, April 28th.</p>
<p>Liu Ke was from Jilin and spoke fluent English. He told Shixun that he was a graduate of the Political Science Department of Yenching University. He had a rather democratic mindset. Talking with him, we felt that we were all taking an objective stance. He lacked the consistently simple, narrow, undemocratic, and tiresome political jargon theory of lower-ranking communist political instructors, where there was a desire to speak, but nothing came out of it.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th, Zhou Baozhong and he personally came to the reporters' residence to take Rick to the airport and see him off. After this, Liu Ke often came, sometimes bringing large packages of cigarettes, sometimes sending a lot of alcohol. As soon as he sat down, he would talk freely about everything. He shed his military uniform and put on a Zhongshan suit, making him even more casual. We frankly told him about the "secret radio station," and he laughed at the idea. He admitted that the communist army generally lacked scientific common sense. Such willingness to admit mistakes earned him a new level of respect from us.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of May 2nd, he accompanied us to the Yamato Hotel for a luncheon hosted by the communist Mayor of Changchun, Liu Juying. He told us that the Peiping Executive Headquarters had sent a telegram saying they would send a plane to pick us up back to Shenyang. We were overjoyed, but Beckett suddenly pouted and said, "This morning, I was on the balcony and saw two planes circling constantly over the West Airport, with gunfire from below. The plane coming to pick us up is probably going to run into trouble again." Sure enough, during the meal, Zhou Baozhong said, "Two planes came this morning and strafed at low altitude. We definitely had casualties. I haven't received a confirmed report yet. Our soldiers thought it was a plane coming to pick you up, so they all ran out without markings, and unexpectedly, they were shot at." He said he would never prevent our return flight, but if the airfield was damaged, that would be terrible! This was our first disappointment.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, the same day that the Northeast Bureau hosted us for dinner, Liu Ke came again and told us that the Peiping Executive Headquarters would send a plane to pick us up tomorrow. The telegram was sent to the Northeast Bureau. On the evening of the 4th, we packed our luggage, ready to leave tomorrow. But on the morning of the 5th, Zhou Baozhong's adjutant suddenly arrived, wanting to speak to Liu Ke. When he learned that Liu Ke was not there, he told us that the plane was not coming today and asked us to inform Liu Ke that he did not need to accompany us to the airport. When Liu Ke arrived, he was truly ignorant of the situation, confused and went back to Zhou Baozhong. Later, at Zhang Xuesi's place, Zhou Baozhong came specifically to show Liu Ke Bai Dete's telegram to us. It read:</p>
<p>"I have decided to send a special plane to land in Changchun between 12 PM and 2 PM tomorrow to pick you up."</p>
<p>This was our second disappointment.</p>
<p>Because of the two disappointments, we didn't dare to trust ourselves regarding our flight. Beckett was the first to express, "There definitely won't be any hope again tomorrow." He smiled bitterly at us, so we suggested to him that instead of being bored at home, we should go to the Angel Dance Hall. We finally entered this dark place again. We sat down, feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th, Kaifeng and Liu Ke came together to tell us to prepare to leave, causing us to be busy and flustered. Before we left, we first dismissed the five workers. This was something they had requested from us in advance. At the time of dismissal, we had to raise a severance payment and calculate the food expenses for each person for the past twenty days. Shenzhi and Shixun were penniless, so whoever had money took it out first, planning to settle the accounts in Shenyang. The embarrassing situation was both funny and infuriating!</p>
<p>After a while, Lü Zhengcao also came, representing the Northeast Bureau to see us off. An hour later, we arrived at the West Airport again!</p>
<p>The West Airport, except for some damage to the buildings, was otherwise the same as the day before. The howling wind no longer carried the smell of gunpowder. The grass grew tall, and the ground was full of pits, wooden planks, and gasoline drums – these were obstacles!</p>
<p>We waited at the airport for two hours, but the wind took our hopes away. We waited until 3:30 PM, but there was still no sign of the plane. We all dejectedly returned to the original house, feeling stifled. I really wanted to cry. We were so disappointed! This was our third disappointment. We, the eight Chinese and American reporters, decided to jointly telegram the Executive Headquarters, saying that we were waiting at the airport every day.</p>
<p>When we returned, all the workers were gone. There was no fire in the stove, and the room was empty. It was like an old house that had been abandoned for many years. This gloomy atmosphere was frightening to us. However, we had to find a way to survive, so Shixun and Beckett ran around the streets like crazy, trying to find two Japanese women to cook for us or do laundry.</p>
<p>Night was falling. After walking for half a day, sweat dripped down our faces, but to no avail. The two had to walk back to the residence with big strides. Suddenly, an old man and a young man walked out of a dilapidated house. Shixun asked them what they were doing. The old man's name was Liu Gui, and he said he was a Quartermaster. The young man was his son. Shixun and Beckett were overjoyed. Regardless of their qualifications, they brought them back. It's always better to have someone. Strangely enough, the dinner that was served was no less than the master chef’s meal of Wu. Everyone exclaimed in surprise: "This is really like a fairy tale in a children's book!"</p>
<h3 id="e133">Returning to Shenyang <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th, we got up particularly late, fully expecting that the plane wouldn't come again today, but as soon as breakfast was over, Meng You and Liu Ke came again. Liu Ke's expression was very hurried. He said, "The plane is already parked at the airport. We need to prepare to leave immediately. The plane won't be staying long." When our car passed over Anqiao, the car that sped past us carried Rick Haig and Kang Qinsi, the editor-in-chief of the People's News Propaganda Department. At this point, we were relieved, we were going to leave.</p>
<p>After a while, Zhou Baozhong also rushed over to see us off. We took off southward at 1:30 PM!</p>
<p>We reached Shenyang after an hour, and couldn't help but cheer. Chen Zurun from the International Propaganda Office and the American representative from the Military Affairs Department, knowing the news, rushed to the airport to welcome us. We were both happy and sad to be back in Shenyang. It was at this moment that we realized how concerned we were by the government officials and military leaders in Shenyang, our communist friends, and our respected Chinese and foreign colleagues. They offered their condolences and showed warm hospitality, which was deeply moving. We had only experienced a battle, but the fires of war were still burning on the Chinese people. At this moment and place, we couldn't help but shed tears.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Taipei Aborigines Awaiting Government Pacification <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Taiwan 20th Dispatch: Special Correspondent Muyun</p>
<p>In Taipei County's scenic areas, Wenshan, Suao, and Dong'ao, there are substantial numbers of aborigines, including the "Nanao Aborigines," "Yaogou'an Aborigines," and "Xitou Aborigines," commonly known as the Takasago Tribe. These are civilized aborigines who have been under Japanese control and education. They are truly indigenous people of Taiwan. The people currently referred to as "native Taiwanese" are actually merchants who crossed the sea from Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Guangdong in southern China, and have only maintained lineage ties here for several generations. In reality, the aboriginal inhabitants of Taiwan are a part of the Indochinese people who were forced to flee into the deep mountains and valleys after the late Ming Dynasty, isolated from modern civilization, living a primitive life. A portion of them are now the civilized aborigines — the Takasago Tribe.</p>
<p>Japanese Unconquered</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, the reporter went to Taitung to investigate, and also took the opportunity to observe the lives of the Takasago Tribe in the Zuoshui Magan area of Suao and Dong'ao. On the small train from Luodong to Zuoshui (this line was built by the Taiwan Takushoku Kaisha, primarily for transporting wood from Taiping Mountain, and it also carries passengers. Since February 15th, it has been jointly managed by the Industrial and Mining Department and the Agricultural and Forestry Department. The total length from Luodong to the terminal Tu Chang is 37.1 kilometers), District Chief Liao and Mr. Chen, who has been here for more than ten years, pointed to the shrouded mountains and said that the Japanese spent eight or nine years and had many people shot dead in these mountains. This is their graveyard for conquering the aborigines. In those years, the aborigines were restrained and deprived of their wild freedom and security of life. Their agricultural activities were restricted, and they were forcibly subjected to Japanese education and language. However, after the Japanese surrendered, a reaction arose in their simple minds, and they rekindled the flames of resistance. They said, "We have not been conquered."</p>
<p>Glimpse of Aboriginal Life</p>
<p>In the Zuoshui Magan area, there are 490 households of Takasago Tribe compatriots, about 2600 people. Their total number in Taiping Mountain is over 8,000, Suao has fewer, about 6,000, and others are scattered in Hualien Port, Hsinchu, and other places. Their lives are all the same: squatting in small wooden houses huddled on the side of the mountains. The only things in the houses are simple straw mats, but on the dirt floor, firewood is piled up to burn yam skins and weeds, emitting a wild atmosphere that far surpasses the "level of civilization" given by the Japanese. Most of them can speak Japanese. The men among them are either knitting baskets and sharpening knives indoors during the day, or going to the mountains to farm and gather firewood. A German engineer used a twelve-kilometer-long water diversion project on Clear Water Mountain to generate electricity for the residents of the mountainous area, but the Takasago Tribe are not accustomed to enjoying it. Most of the women wear tattered clothes, some also wear Western-style clothing, and their faces are tattooed with patterns. In Dong'ao, we met a Takasago woman sitting on a mat weaving rattan. She was working as a nurse at the affiliated hospital of National Taiwan University. In Magan, we met a young Japanese woman who had just graduated from the police station. She and they were the most outstanding figures. Agricultural cultivation and planting are primitive, without fertilization, and after one or two years, they no longer cultivate and move the land. Each household has a "warehouse," where rice, yams, vegetables, and peanuts are stored in small houses built high up like pigeon cages. They say this is to avoid rats. Women who marry Han Chinese are subject to the most severe punishment by the tribe, but in Zuoshui, a Takasago nurse followed a Japanese doctor back to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Conversation with Young Aborigine</p>
<p>The reporter had a brief conversation with a young aborigine, Wudesheng, who had just graduated from the Taipei Police Training Institute and was studying Japanese annotated texts. When the reporter asked about the aborigines' real feelings after the Retrocession, he replied: "For a period after the Retrocession, the aborigines were afraid of the attitude the Chinese government would take, and everyone panicked. Now, things have gradually changed, but generally, they all think that the price of rice used to be only a few cents per catty, but now it has risen sharply, which is unbearable. I personally want to do something for the government and the aborigines. It's just that the government can't agree to him, which is a problem." The reporter told him that the government treats the aborigines as fellow countrymen and that all the past Japanese restrictions have been lifted, and they will have the freedom to obtain jobs and live their lives in the future. (The Zuoshui Police Station has publicly announced the removal of the old terms for savages and barbarians). He and a group of 135 aborigine youths are leaders in the area. He conveyed the opinions of the government and the local police station to the tribe, and he became a crucial intermediary.</p>
<h3 id="e135">American Scientist Predicts Disease-Causing Bacteria Will Become Resistant to Penicillin <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Hous Molitoi, who studies therapeutics at the Merck Institute, gave an alarming prediction at a meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, stating that "Penicillin" would lose its therapeutic efficacy within five to ten years.</p>
<p>Unless chemists can improve Penicillin and keep it effective, patients suffering from pneumonia and streptococcal infections will need new bactericides to treat them.</p>
<p>Currently, great drugs such as Penicillin and Streptomycin will become useless waste within a few years. This is because bacteria are constantly developing resistance to these compounds. Dr. Molitoi predicts that in the future, doctors will need to use a thousand times the dose and use it faster to cure patients.</p>
<p>One way to prevent Penicillin from becoming ineffective is to avoid giving patients this drug unless it is really necessary. Making this drug into pills or ointments, so that patients receive only a small amount of the compound, or using it in conditions that it cannot treat, such as influenza, will accelerate the ineffectiveness of Penicillin.</p>
<p>When using Penicillin, the dose used must be able to kill the bacteria within a few days before the bacteria become accustomed to the drug and develop resistance. (Translated from the March 23rd "Science News Letter")</p>

<p>— Mao Shukai, dispatched from Nanjing on the 27th</p>
<p>A National Assembly delegate from Hunan Province told the reporter: "Hunan Province contributed the most during the War of Resistance and suffered the most damage. Currently, the entire Hunan is on the verge of collapse. There is a shortage of food, housing, clothing... shortages in everything. When we, the National Assembly delegates, passed through Yueyang, hundreds of representatives of the people came to petition, requesting that the National Assembly delegates report the disaster to the central government after arriving in Beijing, hoping to quickly obtain relief. Many of these representatives of the people were only wearing shorts. A complete cloth garment is considered a luxury item here. The magistrate of Yueyang County originally had a pamphlet to report the disaster situation to us, but the county government gave up because it could not afford the printing costs. The civil servants of the county government now only eat one meal a day."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Dug Up Kudzu Roots, Pressed Out Milky Juice with a Stone Mill <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Readers often hear stories of famine victims eating grass roots and tree bark, but they may not necessarily understand how they eat them. Now, we have a real-life example to report to readers: In Hunan's Xuefeng Mountain, Wugong Mountain, and other mountainous areas, wild kudzu vines grow everywhere. Starving people dig up the roots of these kudzu vines and carry them home in large bundles. They use stone mills to press out a milky white liquid. After being boiled in boiling water, it turns into a block of semi-solid substance. It is said to contain some starchy matter and has a slightly bitter taste. Currently, millions of Hunanese people are relying on this kudzu root to sustain their lives.</p>
<p>Hunan was originally a rice-producing region, but after the enemy's plundering and the military's requisitioning of grain, all the stored grain has been emptied. Coupled with last year's drought, this has created an unprecedented famine. Large numbers of refugees are concentrating in the cities, but what is there in the cities?</p>
<h3 id="e138">Lucky Houses: Only Fourteen Buildings Remaining in the Entire City <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After six conferences and a major fire in the provincial capital of Changsha, and after a month and eighteen days of fierce street fighting, burning and bombing, after victory, only fourteen buildings remained standing in the entire city by sheer luck. Countless battles have long turned Changde into a pile of rubble, with only half a fortress remaining. For dozens of miles along both sides of the Hunan-Guangdong section of the Yuehan Railway, no human habitation can be found. Under such dire circumstances, the people still have to bear the burden of military grain. The total amount for this year was initially set at 12 million shi. In reality, even if all of the province's resources were gathered, it probably wouldn't be enough to pay for that much military grain. Later, the authorities reduced it to 4 million dan. Can you imagine, how can the people of Hunan, who are already eating grass roots and tree bark, still have the ability to supply military grain? As a result, less than one-tenth was collected before it was stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Grain Stores Emptied Long Ago: Trees on the Mountains All Felled <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Although western Hunan was not ravaged by enemy forces, it was a major military station when the war situation in central Hunan was tense. The troops passing through demanded this and that. Western Hunan has always been a well-known poverty-stricken area, and it could not withstand years of supporting a large number of troops. All the grain stores were eaten clean long ago, and the trees on the mountains were all felled for construction purposes, leaving nothing behind. Currently, starving people gather as bandits, and no one dares to go near places twenty miles from the towns.</p>
<p>The people of Hunan have a strong and indomitable spirit. After the occupation, the people spontaneously organized guerrilla forces. Small numbers of enemy troops entering the villages were often killed. Therefore, the Japanese invaders harbored great hatred and carried out particularly brutal burning and killing. When they gathered large forces to attack small villages, they razed everything to the ground. In particular, they often used machine guns to collectively slaughter oxen and burned agricultural tools and seeds. Therefore, the rural areas of occupied Hunan have been thoroughly destroyed. Post-war relief is now an urgent task.</p>

<p>Before the war, Hunan Province had more than 400 public and private secondary and higher education institutions. Now, 80% have been destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that have not been destroyed are missing pieces. There are benches but no desks; there are desks but no benches. It is estimated that there are more than a million young people out of school.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has agreed to provide Hunan with 100,000 tons of flour, but due to transportation difficulties, only 4,000 tons have been delivered. Sichuan Province has agreed to supply 200,000 shi of rice, and Jiangxi has also agreed to subsidize 200,000 dan of grain. However, not a single grain has been shipped to date. The Hunan representatives attending the National Assembly have been in contact with the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Four Banks Joint Office, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for days, requesting loans and increased relief supplies, but with little result. One representative angrily told reporters, "The people of Hunan have no choice but to starve to death!" The reporter was deeply moved by this and readily agreed to report the serious disaster situation in Hunan to all sectors of society and the people of the whole country. I believe that it will surely receive widespread sympathy and assistance, and I firmly believe that the millions of suffering Hunanese compatriots can be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Bengbu's Salt Industry Plummets <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Bengbu Report on the 23rd, Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>After more than seven years of devastation, Bengbu has suffered serious internal injuries. The social situation after the recovery is still extremely corrupt, with glaring contradictions. The pacification is not peaceful, and the public security is not secure. On the surface, they are doing their best to gloss over the situation and decorate the city with unnecessary construction, but this cannot cover up the internal wounds. Ten counties in northern Anhui have been occupied and harassed by the Communists, causing the generally docile people to be unable to live in peace and unable to enjoy their work. Those who have fled gather in Bengbu, struggling on the brink of starvation.</p>
<p>Bengbu is the largest transportation and sales market for Huai salt on the Anhui-Henan bank of the Huai River. Unfortunately, most of the salt fields in the Huai area are under the control of the Communists and cannot be freely transported and sold. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway, which is being repaired and destroyed at the same time, has long lost its effectiveness in transporting salt, thus causing the salt industry in Bengbu to plummet. Transporters have no salt to transport, salt shops have no commission to collect, and the decline of the salt industry affects the collection of salt taxes. The Director-General of the Salt Administration, Zhai Qiujie, after observing the situation in Bengbu a few days ago, believed that the shortage of income was due to smuggling. Therefore, he added bureau posts on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, calling it the final inspection and supplementary collection line, requiring all untaxed goods to be paid within fifteen days. In addition, a large number of salt police were transferred to strengthen the inspection and seizure forces along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, the market price of Huai salt rose from 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per dan yesterday.</p>
<p>Bengbu, which has always relied on salt and grain as its main commodities, has seen both items become sluggish since this month due to scarce sources and sluggish sales. As for rice, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days have caused widespread panic. In addition, the surrounding counties are all suffering from grain shortages, with the price per shi rising from 70,000 to break through the 90,000 yuan mark. Wheat has also entered the market and has followed suit, with each shi costing 54,000 yuan and facing a situation of supply falling short of demand. The local authorities have yet to come up with a way to suppress the soaring prices of rice and grain.</p>
<p>With the soaring prices of rice and grain, other commodity prices have also fluctuated greatly, and the general middle class is suffering unspeakable hardship. Teachers in various primary and secondary schools have requested relief from the Anhui Relief and Rehabilitation Branch. People in the community who are enthusiastic about education, after being prompted by public opinion here, have enthusiastically launched a movement to respect teachers. Celebrities in military and political circles have actively donated to promote the movement, and it is believed that the fund of 20 million yuan will not be difficult to raise in a short period of time.</p>

<h3 id="e143">A Good Way to Solve the Housing Shortage <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper that the authorities will deal with the city's housing shortage in a strict manner in the short term, or will adopt the same method as Beijing and forcibly rent out vacant houses. Specifically, each household will be limited to two rooms for every five people, and three rooms for every six or more people, with a maximum of four rooms, to punish those who have vacant houses and do not rent them out. This measure is truly wise. Since the outbreak of the war, the city's housing shortage has become increasingly serious. Recently, solving the housing problem has become even more difficult than the food problem. After all, no matter how high the price of food is, it is not necessary to use gold bars as a medium. There are still not many people who are completely without food, while the housing shortage has left the general middle class and small citizens in a completely helpless state. In the past, during the enemy puppet period, the puppet municipal authorities repeatedly issued announcements strictly prohibiting the collection of key money, but it was just a piece of paper with no practical measures, only giving the citizens a bad impression. After the victory, the municipal authorities have not taken any relief measures. This time, Mayor Wu took office and, in addition to making efforts to suppress food prices, has further addressed the housing shortage, which has truly made the small citizens extremely delighted. At present, there is no shortage of houses in Shanghai. As your newspaper has stated, assigning houses based on the number of people will naturally eliminate the evil practice of key money. Three years ago, I lived in Yantai City, Shandong Province, which was also under the iron heel of the Japanese enemy. The housing panic was similar to the current situation in Shanghai. The Japanese instructed the local authorities to allocate houses based on a few square feet per person, ordering those with excess houses to rent them out. After this news spread, the situation changed greatly. Landlords who occupied large houses with a small number of people not only dared not ask for key money but also widely contacted relatives and friends to recruit tenants. After all, the discipline of the enemy puppet army was extremely poor, and if such people were rented to, the landlords would never have peace. Therefore, as long as they were decent people who were willing to live there, they were welcome regardless of the amount of rent. Later, I moved to this city, but I had neither gold bars nor power. The suffering I have endured in terms of housing over the years cannot be described in a few words. I often thought to myself that housing allocation is the most reasonable and effective way to solve the housing shortage. Why did the municipal authorities not see this and allow the small citizens of the city who had no gold bars to be unable to find a tile to cover their heads? Until today, after reading the news in your newspaper, I couldn't help but call it a wise measure, which truly touched my heart. I hope that the authorities will make a decisive decision and proceed resolutely. As long as there is determination and steps, the results will be as quick as a shadow following a pole and can be expected soon. It is definitely not as difficult and complicated as suppressing rice prices. As for the unreasonable aspects such as excessively low rents, we must also find ways to adjust them so that we can gradually restore the normal state before the war. I hope that your newspaper can publish this letter in your newspaper and forward it to the relevant authorities for reference, so as to attract the attention of the authorities and people of Florida so that the severe housing shortage can be solved easily. Sincerely yours, a small citizen.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Worries of Provisional University Students <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Editor: Please forgive my presumption in writing directly, and I hope you can publish it. As everyone knows, the summer vacation is coming soon, and we, the students of the Provisional University preparatory class, are worried about the standards for future distribution. It's not that we don't work hard or try hard, but the fact is that even if you work hard and try hard, the future distribution may become a problem. Isn't this a strange and contradictory thing? No, editor, please read it patiently to the end. The level of the preparatory class varies greatly. Comparing the best and the worst is simply unbelievable to everyone. In addition, the professors of each group and each subject are not the same person, so the teaching materials are not unified. Also, the professors have different psychologies when grading papers, so it is difficult to calculate the standards based on test scores alone. For example, one group of professors can understand the students' difficulties, and everyone's test scores are above 80 or 90 points. Another group of professors is very suspicious, so they gave a small half of the students zero scores, but in fact, the level of the students in the latter group is not necessarily lower than that of the former group. So, can we just rely on scores to determine the distribution standards? This is the first point. In this semester's exam, the proctors were too lenient, and the practice of cheating was rampant. If you were to be there, you could truly say that you would be amazed. So, can these test scores be used as a standard? This is the second point. There are also some students who have not studied some subjects at all because they majored in vocational subjects in high school and also plan to major in vocational subjects in college, but the preparatory class treats them all as if they have studied them under the principle of reviewing. These students have suffered a great loss. In the future, they will definitely not study it, so under certain principles, they have all suffered great misfortune because their scores are not enough. You must know that if their scores are not enough, it will be difficult to distribute them. This is the third point. Our only hope is that the final exam will be as strict as possible and that the grades of each subject should be evaluated according to the students' wishes. If there are a few subjects that are absolutely unnecessary, then the failing scores should be accommodated as much as possible because they have neither learned it before nor will they learn it later. The wise preparatory class authorities, here are just a few of the main points that have been disclosed above as a reference and suggestion for future distribution standards. It must be a very sincere approval, a student of the Provisional University preparatory class, May 26th.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Unborn Baby <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Shuzhuang</p>
<p>This article was originally published in the Women and Family Companion magazine and then abridged in the American Reader's Digest. The original article is largely based on the original author Amram Scheinfeld's famous book "You and Heredity" and his new book "Women and Men," with the addition of other reliable arguments and supplements. —Translator's Note.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, parents have often asked these kinds of questions about their unborn children, and the answers they received were often wrong. Scientists have only recently uncovered this secret of the first stage of life, and now parents can get the correct answers.</p>
<p>[1] Is there any way for parents to get a boy or a girl as they wish?</p>
<p>No. The sex of the baby is determined at the moment of conception, when one of the two types of sperm enters the egg. Parents cannot do anything in advance to determine the sex of their future child. (Note: Recent scientific research shows that men have two types of sperm, one that produces girls and one that produces boys. These two types of sperm enter the vagina in the same way, and their proportions cannot be changed artificially. However, usually only one sperm can enter the egg and become an embryo, so the sex of the fetus depends on which type of sperm enters the egg and is determined, and cannot be changed later. Chinese people often blame women for not giving birth to sons, and men use this as an excuse to divorce and remarry or take concubines. Poor women have nowhere to complain and can only blame their "unproductive bellies." Well, now new scientific evidence proves that women cannot be held responsible for the sex of the fetus. Whether or not to have a son is still a matter for the men themselves.)</p>
<p>[2] Can the sex of the baby be predicted before birth?</p>
<p>No. The common general notion that male fetuses kick more violently in the womb than female fetuses is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[3] What color eyes will a foreign baby have?</p>
<p>If both parents have blue eyes, their baby will mostly have blue eyes. If one parent has blue eyes and the other has blue-eyed parents, siblings, half of their children may have blue eyes. If both parents have dark eyes, but both sides of the family have blue eyes, then one in every four children may have blue eyes. If there are no blue-eyed people in the family at all, then the child's eyes will definitely be dark.</p>
<p>[4] Is it easier for a child to resemble the father or mother who has distinctive features?</p>
<p>In some ways, yes. In terms of each parent's appearance, the one with more obvious features - such as a very long nose, large ears, large eyes, long eyelashes, etc. - will have many opportunities to reappear on the child. If that special appearance has been passed down for several generations in either parent, then their children will have even more opportunities to have that special part.</p>
<p>[5] If both parents are unattractive, is there a chance that they will have a beautiful child?</p>
<p>Very likely. Of course, if both parents are good-looking, the child will be more likely to be good-looking. But it is also very possible that if both parents are unattractive, they may pass on the hidden genetic factors in their bodies to the newborn child, which can produce a particularly beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>[6] We often hear many legends that if a mother is frightened during pregnancy, the child will have strange marks or defects after birth. Is this really possible?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. There is no direct connection between the mother's nervous system and the fetus's. The mother's thoughts and experiences cannot find a representative symbol in the child. Only fantasies or accidental coincidences support this theory.</p>
<p>[7] Can children born to couples in love have better temperaments?</p>
<p>Yes. This is not due to heredity or prenatal influence - it simply means that children born in this environment may have better personalities.</p>
<p>[8] Will children inherit the personality of the parent who has the stronger personality?</p>
<p>No. Parents' personalities are not inherited by children. Children are born with certain genetic factors that are a combination of both parents' bloodlines. However, most of their personalities are created by experience and training.</p>
<p>[9] Will children of parents who have received little education be less intelligent than children of parents who have received higher education?</p>
<p>No. Children's intelligence is not affected by their parents' education. Whether or not parents are educated does not change their inheritance of intelligence.</p>
<p>[10] If a husband returns from the army with serious injuries, will the child have defects if they have a child?</p>
<p>No. As long as a man is fertile, his physical condition, age, and health will not affect the child's genetic makeup.</p>
<p>[11] If a man has had an infectious disease when he was young, will his child have the risk of inheriting his disease in the future?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. Bacterial diseases will not be transmitted to children unless the mother has already contracted the disease first, in which case she may transmit the bacteria to her fetus, so that the child will have the disease at birth. If the man's illness has been cured, his child will not get the disease because of him.</p>
<p>[12] Is the child's blood relationship with the mother closer than with the father?</p>
<p>No. Because not a drop of the mother's blood goes directly to the child. Her blood is first transformed into countless kinds of primordial substances, which are filtered through the placenta, from which the fetus makes its own blood.</p>
<p>[13] What is the possibility of having twins?</p>
<p>In every ninety pregnancies, there is a chance of having twins; in every eight thousand, there is a chance of having triplets; and in every seven hundred thousand, there is a chance of having quadruplets.</p>
<p>[14] In a large family, will the youngest child often have a very different personality from the first-born child?</p>
<p>Yes. From a genetic point of view, the order of birth is not a factor that causes personality differences; only the environment is. When the youngest child is born, the parents are often more experienced and have a better environment; at the same time, they also have the help of older brothers and sisters. Therefore, the youngest child in a large family is often more precocious, sensible, and independent.</p>

<h3 id="e147">The Mayor's Wife Talks About Current Work <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>When Mrs. Wu, the mayor's wife, recently met with reporters from various newspapers, she talked about the most important work at present, which is to practice frugality and promote education.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, Mrs. Wu had seen the suffering of the starving prisoners in various provinces before coming to Shanghai. People living in Shanghai should practice frugality and work together to seek relief. Regarding the second point, education is the prerequisite for all construction. If education cannot be popularized, then nothing can be done.</p>
<p>In fact, these two tasks can be started from the family. If the family can practice frugality, it can indirectly cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere. There are many wives who only know how to enjoy themselves and do not care where their husbands' money comes from or what methods they use to get it. There are also many wise wives who, even though the material enjoyment is very poor, can create spiritual happiness so that their husbands can concentrate on their careers. At the same time, housewives are the planners and implementers of consumption. Americans have a saying that housewives hold the strings of the nation's purse. Therefore, how a housewife manages the family may affect the entire country's economic structure. Modern housewives should not only know how to do housework (House Keeping), but also take on the responsibility of building a family (Home-Making).</p>
<p>Regarding the popularization of education, starting from the family is also a very reasonable way. If we take the family as a unit and completely eliminate illiteracy in each unit, and then promote it to the neighboring families, then we can complete the task of eliminating illiteracy in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu, the mayor's wife, has received modern education, and she has been following the mayor in the important municipal positions he has held over the years. She must have a lot of insights into the municipal facilities. From now on, she can lead the women of the city to complete great tasks.</p>

<p>This is a simple and easy-to-make little garment suitable for children within one year of age. Any light and soft fabric and flannel can be used. The color should be light-colored and plain.</p>
<p>Cut according to the style in the picture, connect the sleeves to the body of the garment, sew two rows of gathering stitches at the neckline and cuffs, and then sew on a small lace trim. Embroider two small flowers on the chest, and a very artistic little garment is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Opium Song <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Bā Líng</p>
<p>"Stepping into the opium den, pleading to heaven and kowtowing to the earth; one pipe of opium, ecstatic joy; lying down for a sleep, conversing about heaven and earth; three puffs and a whoosh, energetic and vibrant; bent double coming in, standing straight going out; meeting an opium fiend, addressed as 'brother'; no money in the pocket, stealing sheep and catching chickens; having some banknotes, eating another three 'cash' worth. The front door of the house, no need to care about it; called an opium immortal, carefree and without worry. It is a pity that recently, the price of opium is outrageously expensive; small business owners, unable to afford to eat it continuously; moreover, the government is determined to prohibit opium; if one does not quit opium, one will go to jail; suffering all kinds of hardships, with no recourse for complaint; thinking of this moment, it is better to quit opium."</p>
<p>This is a song describing the person who smokes opium, bankrupting their family, extremely realistic.</p>
<p>In any family, if there is someone who smokes opium in the household, that family will certainly not be wholesome. Now, as victory arrives, the government is determined to prohibit opium. It is hoped that those with opium addiction will quickly reform themselves, make a firm resolution, and wage a deadly battle with the utterly evil opium. Recover human life anew and create a happy and fulfilling family.</p>
