<p>社論</p>
<h3>英國控制投資聯想</h3>
<p>路透電傳，英下院已通過控制投資法。其內容雖沒有詳載，但據財相所稱，「此法爲遏制投機之一種辦法。此次戰後，　不預防資本之濫用，則混亂之情形，必不能免」云云，可知此項法案，定是調節游資，遏抑投機的一種必要手段。</p>
<p>我們因此聯想到我國戰後投資方面的情形了。就上海一埠而論，各種新企業的組織，雖已逐漸萌動，本報也迭經彙集刋載，但從整個的經濟界觀察，其數目還是微乎其微。而且就其事業性質來看，都是些進出口業，倉庫業，保險業，運輸榮，證券業，和房地產業等，輕工業已經很少，更談不到重工業。所有大量的炎金，東轉西灣，恐怕還是逃不出投機的一途，第一個目標，當然是質金，美鈔，中外證券，其次便是紗布一類的貨物，大部份也還是所稱踢皮球的性質，在交易市塲上兜圈子，並非完完實銷，更談不到生產。質言之，中國戰後的投資，如果情况不轉變，根本無所謂投資，乃投機而已！</p>
<p>復員以來，已將牛載，幣制雖未能說是大定，但至少通貨膨脹不致如已往之甚，而物價波動之烈，却比戰爭期內，有過之而無不及，其間的原因，雖不止一端，而投機的狂熱，實爲其最直接的主因。所以工潮的澎湃，生活的困難，和一般社會的杌隉不安，可說都是投機家猖狂之賜。投機何以狂熱？無非是市場上的游資，還得不到正當歸宿的結果。英財相所稱，此次戰後，茍不預防資本之濫用，則混亂之情形必不能免。我們相信我國的查本，早已濫用，混亂的情形，也早已發生，而且很普徧地發生，然而我們却還沒有聽見我們的「財相」拿出什麼具體辦法來控制投資，遏止投機。三民主義的中國，在這些地方，似乎反不及資本主義的英國，真令我們慚愧萬分！</p>
<p>照今天中國投機狂熱，為害社會的情形來講，那末我們是否應該仿照英國一下，也把這些游資加以控制，而阻遏其投機作祟呢？我們覺得：取締某種交易（例如禁止公債股票的非法買賣），發放某種物資（例如封存物資的眞正平賣），和零星地發還或出售若十小型工廠，實在還不是切實有效的辦法。因爲這些辦法，還不够使那些游資得到正當的歸宿，便不能减少投機的狂熱。</p>
<p>要達到上項目的，我們認爲：這辦法也很通常，並不一定就要完全抄襲他國的成法。假如我們先能趕緊辦到左列各點，多少就有了希望。</p>
<p>（一）外匯率不管定得高或低，從速決定公佈，使進出口業可以恢復，那麼，商業上的炎金便有出路。</p>
<p>（二）各地所接收的工廠，（不限於上海，）應發還的從速發還，應出售的從速出售，應國營的從速開廠，應出租的從速出租經營，務使各種工廠烟突都能冒烟，機輪都能轉動，切勿再「佔了毛則不拉屎」，貼了封條久不撕，那麼工業上的貸金，也有出路。</p>
<p>（三）所封存的物資，或發還，或出售，或優先承購，或公開投標，一切均照規定從速淸理，從速決定，萬勿再拖。例如刧餘紗布，據業中人的聲訴，請求發還，似乎持之有故，言之成理，也應該是則是，吾則吾，依照情理法律，從速審議批示，切莫今天開會，明天審查，挨了三五個月還在擱置之中。只要物資流通，則籌碼的需要自更殷切，還那裏會再有游資。</p>
<p>（四）恢復交通，暢通貨運，使各地貨物都能從水陸運輸綫上源源交流，同時各地金融機構應該趕快普徧復員，便利商業上的存放匯兌，使各地相互間的金融商業都逐漸繁榮起來，那麼，需要融通的資金自必更多。</p>
<p>（五）恢復治安秩序，取消一切苛雜攤派，使各地民衆的生命財產，可以確保，那麼，在滬避難的殷富，便可以望資還鄉，本埠的遊資，自然隨之而洗散到各地去了。</p>
<p>以上各項辦法，眞可說卑之無甚高論，並不須像英國那樣特定法案，控制投資，祇須政府下大次心，分別實施，目前投機和混亂的情形，至少可以解次過半。好得政治協商會議，業已圓滿閉幕，各黨各派大家許諾合作，我們相信此後政治定有辦法。政治有辦法，則治安，交通，財政等等，當然也有辦法。過去幾個月的投機和混亂情形，總可以逐漸消滅。</p>
<p>惟有一點，中央乃至地方當局，千萬不可以爲協商會議閉幕，政府即須改組，大家存了五日京兆的心理，把應該趕辦的事，拖延不辦。須知小疾不醫，積久可成大病。投機市塲的　祟，如不在初起波浪的時候設法除根，終必有一天汪洋泛濫，閙出大災來的。我們不願當局只做焦頭爛　的上客，却希望他們速來曲突從薪罷。</p>

<h3>柯克上將談　建立我國海軍　美移交船隻在商討中</h3>
<p>美海軍總司令柯克上將日前官渝返滬，昨午招待記者談話。柯克將軍稱：此次赴渝謁蔣主席，商討訓練中國海軍，同時運軍北上，及撤退日人各種問題，希望訓練中國海軍，在有計劃中進行。同時，運軍北上及撤退日人之工作，亦儘速完成。至美海軍於去年十二月起，已在靑島開始訓練海軍，希望能完成訓練一千五百人。現在美方受訓之海軍，的有一千一百人。關於美方移交或出售與我方船隻之事，柯克將軍稱，至現時爲止，尙未有若何船隻交付中國，一切均在進行商討中。柯氏又稱，美海軍助我運軍北上，現以秦皇島爲登陸地點，因葫蘆鳥已結冰，無法登陸，運軍之事，仍在繼續中，撤退日人及運軍隊之事，在中國海軍得相當訓練後，可能於今年四月主持此項工作。談及美國海軍在中國之情形時，柯氏表示，美海軍在中國無所謂基地，只是利用中國之港口工作而已。現今美軍在華之大小船艦，約一百七十餘艘，在戰後美國在中國之海軍大量增加，比戰前多數倍，有問日艦移交中國之問題者，柯氏稱，尙未決定。</p>

<p>美政府以復員期間，一部分於戰時加人軍隊之官兵，多退伍回國，而美國於平時即存在之常備軍，則仍在軍隊服務。但現美軍各官階，均屬戰時官階，故美政府將予以重新修改。各高級長官均降一級至二級。此間最先由准將改爲上校官階者，爲吾人在聽審日戰犯時最熟識之米都頓將軍，以後卡威將軍，冰克將軍等，均依照非戰時之官隌稱謂。前日奧姆斯特在聯救署招待稱：「本人在戰時是中將，後降級至少將，現在是准將，以後不知是什麼了。」</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>謠諑助長買風　金價逐步上漲　川幫銀行供源不斷</h3>
<p>烚赤昨受報戴美國　金出口之影響，一般心理不問此訊之眞正價值如何，激起買風，「孫票」傳說紛紜，業中大戶連袂爭購，冀將川帮空額擴軋，以致節節盤漲，晨開即承前日餘風，升至一一三萬，初時尙形平庸，後以金業帮連袂哄抬，散戶亦追隨不巳，遂自一一二萬五逐步盤好，惟一二一萬大關頗多進退，終以人心奇振，午刻漲到一二三萬以上川帮銀行逢高力售，午收爲一二二萬，較前收猛騰十五萬三，午後一度喊高至一二四萬左右，川帮銀行頗多供源，銀根亦漸緊，最後退至一一九萬左右，現期均有做開，但不甚廣泛，銀樓飾金十三萬元，紋銀一千二，銀元亦升爲六九〇元左右，銀根昨以游資集中金股而趨緊，息價約一角至一角四分。</p>
<p>美鈔隨金市共榮，對黃金差價拔開至七一〇元以上，中途不少出金購鈔者，晨開即升爲一六一〇元，中途極多掙扎，午刻步漲至一七二〇元，但午後復隨金價降爲一六八〇元左右，結果較前收漲起八〇元，港票呆滯如舊，惟新貨（一）字頭與（二）字頭拔聞稍巨，結果老貨平，新貨（二）字頭小二元，（一）字頭則平。</p>
<h3>股票風再厲</h3>
<p>華股繼續蓬勃，證券帮大戶推動下，各股復有進一步高價之希冀，惟中途一部份游資趨往金債，而有數次盤風，大勢美亞較永紗更俏，套賣活動，小型股及冷門各股亦俏利萬分，永紗晨開二五六〇元，開後退至二三二〇元，午刻漲爲二六三〇元，午收二五六〇元，美亞晨開一八五〇元，開後自一八九〇元降爲一七二〇元，午刻竟穿出二千大關，見二〇三〇元，午收一九五〇元，景福晨開一一五元，開後自一二〇元退至一〇七元，午刻又穿出一二〇元以上，結果較前收計永紗漲一四〇元，美亞一二〇元，信和四〇元，景福十元，其餘各股亦漲起一成左右。</p>
<p>外股環境助買，游資紛紛來歸，初開即挺，開後大小各股莫不遭證券帮及銀錢業搜羅，外商亦出而復進，午刻都以高價結束，午收結果較前收漲起一成至二成左右。</p>
<h3>公債又見新高價</h3>
<p>公債自前日由低轉好後，大戶積極推動，昨更得金市方面謠　助長買風，丙種晨開即升爲二〇五〇元，供方寥落異常，漲到二二七〇元新高峯，而後轉趨徘徊，惟賣買價拔開甚遠，以致盤旋幅度亦較鉅，大勢在二一五〇元及二二五〇元之間起仆，午收二二二〇元，較前收計甲乙各升六〇元，丙種二七〇元，丁種七〇元，戊種一四〇元，大戶羣趨熟門，以致雜牌漲勢較遜，外商間有吸收，趨勢殊俏。</p>
<h3>粳秈均回升</h3>
<p>米情以赤金回漲，人心轉堅，粳秈糯均回升四五百元，麵粉亦加四五百元，油市疲而復振，漲千元，惟黃豆則依然平，豆餅微挺，加起百元，棉餅以燃料去化頗活，驟漲五百元。</p>
<h3>紡建售價續增　紗市買氣大盛</h3>
<p>昨日紗市回漲甚劇，客帮雖少採辦，然同業吸胃甚濃，市塲買氣頗盛，一掃上日紅盤時之萎糜情况，其所以見如此上漲者，完全爲前午紡建公司掛牌突高一二萬刺激所致，廿支藍鳳成交七十國萬，計漲五萬，廿支雜牌約升四萬，四十二支尤見俏利，漲起十萬之辦，織廠聞紡建四十二支變綫牌價昨午又增四萬，逆料今日紗市恐益見堅挺。</p>
<h3>絲綢齊漲</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢受黃金價昻刺激而上升，人造絲一二〇天橋現貨最大喊過一百四十五萬元，一百三十八萬元有成交，終做一百四十萬元，棧單隨現貨高翔，九十六七萬元頗有成交，後做九十八萬元，一二〇雜牌因現貨奇缺，價與天橋平，廠經執貨者皆居奇不售，致有價而無交易，綢貨跟原料挺進，市塲做價，美亞被面每百條喊一百〇二萬元買進，一百〇五萬元賣出，終未成交，大誠格璧　每碼三千三百四十元，民生織錦緞每件做開一萬三千元，林記蠟羽紗成交價每碼一千三百元。</p>
<h3>桐油紅盤議定</h3>
<p>桐油紅盤至昨日始行議開，本來以供給洋銷者爲足度，然內銷油亦皆稱爲度桐，故議盤不分內外銷，均評價每市務爲六萬元，惟銷塲均以洋莊爲主體，內銷雖云春銷已將當令，而數量實不敵洋銷之巨，所以市面升降，仍依洋銷之旺衰爲歸，至於洪江桐油，因眞正之西洪已絕跡八年，現雖有幾家復業，然貨未到，故不能議盤，今所議之盤，乃本地自造之洪江桐油，計每桶價格四萬七千八元云。</p>

<h3>向靡靡之音作無情打擊</h3>
<p>— 克</p>
<p>我奇怪，又百思不解，勝利後到今天的上海，依然到處播送流傳着含有麻醉性和毒素的「靡靡之音」！</p>
<p>每次，我在街頭，在影戲院裏，最難堪的尤其是每天在家裏收聽廣播電臺播送音樂唱片的時候，不是「我要你」就是「你不要走」，或者「海燕」「敬郎三杯酒」之類的東西；甚至於一天要聽到好幾遍，不但使我討厭到極點，而且被它們播弄得頭暈目眩了！素稱為「音樂人才集中」的上海，怎麼還是一副老面孔呢？難道上海的音樂家（真正的音樂家）們真甘心讓音樂底渣滓——爵士歌曲長此以往的猖獗下去嗎？</p>
<p>「勝利不是休息」，誠然，勝利後更不是恢復歌舞昇平紙醉金迷的畸形繁榮，而是要我們在各面方更加倍地去努力完成繁重的建國事業，不然，我們這躋列於強國之一的國家還是「金玉其外，敗絮其中」地留下一副難堪相！</p>
<p>就中國底音樂方面說，本身上帶滯留於幼稚的階段裏，人家有「交響樂」（Symphony），我們有什麼呢？人家有「歌劇」（Opera），我們有什麼呢？人家產生出偉大的悲多芬（Beethoven）和瓦格涅（Wagner）等音樂名家，我們又產生了誰？這些落後的情形我們也不必多談，盡人皆知；祗是今後如何建立我們底民族音樂，如何建立起我們國家民族所需要的正統音樂一層講起來，無疑地期待於我們底音樂家去努力，期待於我們底賢明政府來更熱心地倡導和扶助，我認為這是一件刻不容緩的而有意義的工作。</p>
<p>所以首先我建議——</p>
<p>向「靡靡之音」作無情地打擊！</p>
<p>第一，請政府當局趕緊取締這些「靡靡之音」，銷毀這些播散着毒素的唱片。我們目前並不是完全沒有雄偉興奮和發揚愛國精神的歌曲，並不是完全沒有崇高的藝術歌曲，而且在上海又灌製唱片的地方，請有關文化宣傳事業的主持當局趕緊把這類歌曲灌製唱片，取而代之，分配各電臺，各影戲院應用。</p>
<p>第二，請政府查辦這些毒素歌曲底製作者。</p>
<p>我們都知道：這些毒素歌曲底「作曲家」，大多是附逆的「音樂界」底敗類，他們不但投機取巧，麻醉人心；而且甘心為敵偽播施毒素，粉飾太平。</p>
<p>掃除了這些障礙之後，該說到我們自己底努力方面了：</p>
<p>第一，請我們底作曲家，演奏家，認清自己的神聖任務，多產生些適合於我們底國情和需要的所謂「中國化」的音樂作品，多演奏些這一類的樂曲；不要今天演奏着悲多芬底「英雄交響樂」「命運交響曲」，曉邦（Chopin）底「圓舞曲」「小夜曲」和李斯特（Liszt）底「匈牙利狂想曲」；明天還是照樣演奏這些中國人不容易聽得懂的崇高的樂曲；中國的音樂作品雖然幼稚，但是以你們底純熟的技巧和高深的修養演奏給大家欣賞以後，不能說完全收不到效果的。同時請音樂家們彼此不要稍存門戶之見而「樂人相輕」，竭誠地合作起來，在共同的「建立民族音樂」底唯一標幟之下，同心協力去創作和努力。</p>
<p>第二，請政府當局和社會人士重視和熱心倡導音樂，這裏不必說「音樂如何重要」「音樂如何關係國家民族的前途」一類的老生常談了，大家都會作圓滿的解說。然而，據我自己親眼所見，在文化水準相當高的今日之上海，每一次音樂會的舉行，差不多全是聽眾寥寥，門可羅雀，這樣的不踴躍，這樣的冷落凄涼，一塲崇高的音樂會底收入，不但抵不上一場影戲，甚至於抵不上一場蹦蹦戲！觸景生情，言之痛心！我們不能說不是社會人士對於音樂藝術底不瞭解，不重視，和政府當局倡導的不夠。所以為了協助我們民族音樂底建立和發展，一方面要請社會人士重視音樂，因為它是崇高的藝術，它不但能夠「移風易俗」，而且可以美育人格與性情；另一方面請政府當局更熱心地倡導，多培養音樂的人才，多策動有意義的音樂活動。那末，這不但是向「靡靡之音」作無情地打擊，而且更是澈底的有效的打擊。</p>
<h3>賣雜貨的老頭兒</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>——街頭散曲之一</p>
<p>弄冬，弄冬，弄冬……</p>
<p>一個賣雜貨的白髮老人跑過來了——</p>
<p>手裏搖着長柄的小鼓，</p>
<p>背上負着龐大的貨箱，</p>
<p>（要比他的身子大過三四倍！）</p>
<p>活像一隻小螞蟻</p>
<p>背負着一隻金蒼蠅，</p>
<p>或是一塊小肉片。</p>
<p>弄冬，弄冬，弄冬……</p>
<p>他吃力地跑着搖着，</p>
<p>累得滿頭大汗</p>
<p>嘴裏還要不住地叫賣。</p>
<p>白髮老頭兒呵！</p>
<p>把腳步踏得更穩些吧，</p>
<p>把腰桿挺得更直些吧，</p>
<p>當心「生活的重担」</p>
<p>把你一副老骨頭壓扁！</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（十二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨盛把菜撂好以後，墨老爺和翁老爺便開始對酌起來。墨老爺永遠是舉杯就乾，翁老爺喝酒沒有吸煙感興趣。煙對於翁老爺就像酒對於墨老爺一樣，他的哲學是：煙可以迷朦他的意識，讓他不會想到許多。在吞雲吐霧的生涯中，他才能昏昏沌沌地過得很安怡。</p>
<p>「　，大哥找我來還有別的事嗎？」翁老爺想起墨盛曾經告訴他，說墨老爺有事和他商量，所以他這樣問。</p>
<p>「不是別的事。昨兒晚上我作了一個怪夢，今兒就偏有許多不祥之兆，心裏疑惑的很，所以特地請您來替我解解。」</p>
<p>墨老爺說罷，先連着喝了幾杯酒，然後努力地追憶夢中情景，以及把今天所遭遇的事，詳詳細細地告訴了翁老爺，他並且特別強調這個新生的女兒的一些現象，他用疑慮地口吻述敘着。</p>
<p>「天下哪有那麼巧的事呢？我夢見一隻像黃鸝似的鳥兒，從我的身上飛出去，就偏偏今兒生了女兒；又偏偏地墜地以後，哭的時候，竟酷似夢裏那隻鳥兒的叫聲；而且當我第一次看見她，又哭出同樣的聲音。您說這怪不怪？我心裏想：也許是妖精投胎？人倒了霉，什麼倒霉的事兒都會有。為這個，我整整不快活了半響。」墨老爺的臉上，又呈現了痛苦的表情。</p>
<p>「哈哈……」翁老爺聽完卻笑了起來。過了一會，他毫不加思索地說：「您簡直是給嫂夫人——」說到這裏，他連忙低了聲音。「折磨糊塗了！這有什麼奇怪呢？通常咱們不是好把姑娘比作鳥兒的嗎？你夢見一隻鳥兒從您的身上飛出去，不正是騐了你今兒添的一位千金小姐嗎？旣是她們的聲音相同，那麼也許是您這位小姐，前世果是一隻鳥兒，如今脫胎成一位千金了。還說不定您這位千金，不是凡人哩！大哥不用多疑，兄弟賀您一杯！」說罷，翁老爺滿滿斟了一杯酒，和墨老爺一飲而盡。</p>
<p>「至於您說那隻鳥兒像黃鸝，這個據兄弟猜想：我的這位姪女兒，將來大了，準有我老婆的長處——」</p>
<p>墨老爺不等他說完，連忙問：</p>
<p>「什麼「長處」？」</p>
<p>「會哼幾句皮簧什麼的。」翁老爺笑着又作了個預言的解說。</p>
<p>「哦！」墨老爺半信半疑地應了一聲。可是他思索了一會，又禁不住地問。</p>
<p>「那麼，她為什麼一看見我就哭呢？難道是我們爺兒倆沒緣分嗎？」</p>

<h3>外埠學生來滬求學　探討海上學校的優劣　浮華貴族確是要不得</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是才從鄉下來滬不久，對上海的一切當然不明瞭。上海的學校是這麼的多，使多更不知那些學校是良好的？學校的好壞對於學生的前途關係很大，為了鄭重起見，特請貴報指示，滬西有那些中學較好，而並不是浮華貴族子弟讀的，因為那私立學校學費太貴，不是平常學生讀得起的。貴報向以服務社會為目的，必能告訴讀者。實為至幸！滬西讀者：明路寬謹啓</p>
<p>（編者按）你說上海學校多，其實並不多。因為上海人口有五百萬，入學的學生數，當然可觀。而目前失學的人，以及不識字的文盲，卻比比皆是，原因很複雜，但學校還是嫌太少，這是第一點。學校好壞，不能籠統的批評，各校在八年抗戰期間，因經費困難，物資缺乏，設備簡陋，師資低劣，教管失常……，所以一般學校，就很難辦好；復員以後，經教育當局切實整頓，把過去種種，逐漸改善，校務可望好轉，這是第二點。所謂浮華貴族云云，我想此後整飭學風，決不會再有這些惡劣現象。學費已經教局規定，有一定標準，這是第三點。至於滬西那一校配合你的胃口？這也難說，請閲本報各校招生廣告，就可以隨心所欲了。</p>
<h3>徵求各種人才</h3>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 7th Dispatch] According to private sources in Xinjiang, clashes have broken out again between the National Army and the Xinjiang separatist faction.

The separatists are mostly Turkic people, who call their territory the "Republic of East Turkestan," with its capital in Yining. Zhang Zhizhong and three representatives of the separatist faction previously negotiated in Dihua and drafted a treaty. The central government did not approve it because the treaty stipulated that the separatist faction could possess troops in the form of local militias. Negotiations will reopen within the month.</p>

<h3>General Commander-in-Chief He Stresses That the Communist Army Should Observe the Ceasefire Order and Restore the Railways in North China in a Press Conference in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] At the press conference of the Army Headquarters today, Commander-in-Chief He answered the following questions from our newspaper reporter: (Question) According to people from Shandong and other places, the Communist army is obstructing the restoration of traffic. What is the reason? (Answer) It is said that the Communist army has proposed to the military mediation headquarters the requirement of joint control of the railways in North China, as reported in the newspapers. (Question) Has the Communist army at Taian station not obeyed the order to withdraw from the station? (Answer) Not yet. (Question) The Communist army has not complied with the second communique issued by the military mediation headquarters in many cases, such as obstructing the progress of road restoration projects, which has greatly harmed the people. What kind of countermeasures will the military mediation headquarters take? (Answer) It is reported that the military mediation headquarters has requested instructions from the higher authorities in Chongqing. (Question) It is reported that the people trapped in Taian, Lincheng, Zaozhuang, and other places are lacking food. Can the headquarters suggest to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to quickly allocate some flour and transport it for relief? (Answer) Yes. (Question) What are the difficulties currently facing the military mediation headquarters in carrying out its mission, other than transportation? (Answer) The military mediation headquarters advocates that the troops in the conflict areas should retreat to their original positions before the 13th of last month. The National Army has no objection to this, but the Communist army has occupied some cities after the ceasefire deadline and has not yet complied with the order to withdraw.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, returned here by plane after inspecting Xuzhou. Today, he told reporters: Our side has cooperated in urging the Chinese Communists to repair the railways in North China. Brad, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, has gone to Chongqing to consult with the representatives of the Chinese Communists on this matter, hoping that the Chinese Communists will abide by the ceasefire order and restore traffic, so that Japanese expatriates can evacuate, compatriots displaced by the war can return to their homes, and food can be transported to remote areas. I can guarantee that the troops under my command have absolutely obeyed the ceasefire order, remained in their original positions, and stopped firing. However, sporadic conflicts continue to occur everywhere. The responsibility for this is self-evident. The National Army maintains its defense. If the Communist army does not attack again, conflicts will not occur. The surrender of Japanese troops and their repatriation have been delayed due to traffic interruptions, especially in Shandong, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces. The punishment of Japanese war criminals in China will not be carried out for the time being, pending the drafting of a complete list of war criminals. The work of deciding who is a war criminal is proceeding slowly, because China's war of resistance has been so long, and the Japanese commanders have changed several times. At the same time, the investigation is conducted with few records available for verification. However, the Chinese authorities have detained the former Japanese ambassador to the puppet government and one commander of the army and one commander of the division. Traitors will be arrested upon public accusation, and their crimes are worse than those of the Japanese and should be severely punished. Pseudo-military personnel will be tried by military courts, and other traitors will be tried by ordinary courts.</p>
<h3>Lake Tianji Flies to Beiping; Southern Tongpu Railway Opens to Traffic</h3>

Li also denied that the six solution methods proposed by Chen Yi are conditions but are the suggestions for the Executive Headquarters to adopt. Regarding the Executive Headquarters' power to restore transportation, whether it's the same as in stopping the conflict, the Chinese Communist Party's spokesperson replied, "Yes." The roads are mostly calm at present, and the materials needed for the railways are not as difficult as imagined. If there are no obstacles, all the national railways can be restored to traffic before the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee on March 1st. Also, on the 6th, the Executive Headquarters had planes going to Chengde,</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain Controls Investment in Lenovo</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegraph: The British House of Commons has passed the Investment Control Act. While the details of its contents are not fully detailed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, "This law is a method of curbing speculation. If the abuse of capital is not prevented after this war, a chaotic situation will be inevitable." It can be seen that this bill is a necessary measure to regulate floating capital and curb speculation.</p>
<p>This makes us think of the investment situation in our country after the war. Taking Shanghai as an example, although the organization of various new enterprises has gradually begun to emerge, and this newspaper has repeatedly compiled and published them, from the perspective of the entire economic circle, the number is still very small. Moreover, judging from the nature of the business, they are all import and export industries, warehousing, insurance, transportation, securities, and real estate, with very few light industries, let alone heavy industries. A large amount of capital, turning east and west, I am afraid it will still not escape the path of speculation. The first goal is of course gold, US dollars, Chinese and foreign securities, and the second is goods such as cotton yarn. Most of them are still the so-called "kicking the ball" nature, circling in the trading market, not completely selling out, let alone production. In other words, if the situation of investment in China after the war does not change, there is no investment at all, but speculation!</p>
<p>Since the restoration, the cattle have been loaded. Although the currency system cannot be said to be completely stable, at least the inflation is not as severe as in the past, but the intensity of price fluctuations is more severe than during the war. Although the reasons for this are more than one, the fanaticism of speculation is the most direct main reason. Therefore, the surging labor unrest, the difficulty of life, and the general social unrest can be said to be the gifts of rampant speculators. Why is speculation so fanatical? It is nothing more than the fact that floating capital in the market has not yet found a proper destination. As the British Chancellor of the Exchequer said, if the abuse of capital is not prevented after this war, a chaotic situation will be inevitable. We believe that our country's capital has long been abused, and the chaotic situation has already occurred, and it has occurred very widely. However, we have not yet heard our "Chancellor of the Exchequer" come up with any concrete measures to control investment and curb speculation. In these areas, China of the Three Principles of the People seems to be inferior to capitalist Britain, which is truly embarrassing for us!</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation of speculation frenzy in China and its harm to society, then should we imitate Britain and control these floating capitals to prevent their speculation from doing evil? We feel that cracking down on certain transactions (such as prohibiting illegal trading of government bonds and stocks), distributing certain materials (such as truly selling sealed materials at reasonable prices), and returning or selling a few small factories in small amounts are really not effective measures. Because these methods are not enough to allow those floating capitals to find a proper destination, they cannot reduce the fanaticism of speculation.</p>
<p>To achieve the above objectives, we believe that this method is also very common, and it is not necessary to completely copy the successful methods of other countries. If we can quickly achieve the following points first, there will be some hope.</p>
<p>(1) No matter whether the exchange rate is set high or low, it should be decided and announced as soon as possible so that the import and export industry can recover, then there will be a way out for commercial capital.</p>
<p>(2) The factories received in various places (not limited to Shanghai) should be returned as soon as possible, sold as soon as possible, state-owned factories should be opened as soon as possible, and leased as soon as possible to operate, so that the chimneys of various factories can emit smoke and the machines can turn. Do not "occupy the pit and not shit" and seal it for a long time without tearing it off, then there will also be a way out for industrial loans.</p>
<p>(3) The sealed materials should be returned, sold, given priority purchase, or publicly bid for, and everything should be cleared and decided as soon as possible in accordance with the regulations. Do not delay any longer. For example, the remaining cotton yarn from the robbery, according to the appeals of the industry, the request for return seems to be justified and reasonable. If it is correct, it should be affirmed; if it is wrong, it should be rejected. In accordance with reason and law, it should be reviewed and approved as soon as possible. Do not hold a meeting today, review it tomorrow, and still put it on hold after three or five months. As long as the materials are circulating, the need for chips will be even more urgent, so where will there be any floating capital?</p>
<p>(4) Restore transportation, smooth cargo transportation, so that goods from various places can flow steadily from water and land transportation lines. At the same time, financial institutions in various places should quickly and widely resume operations to facilitate commercial deposits, withdrawals, and remittances, so that financial and commercial activities between various places will gradually prosper, then there will inevitably be more funds needed for financing.</p>
<p>(5) Restore law and order, and abolish all kinds of harsh and miscellaneous levies, so that the lives and property of the people in various places can be protected, then the wealthy people who have taken refuge in Shanghai can hope to return to their hometowns with their assets, and the floating capital in this city will naturally be dispersed to various places.</p>
<p>The above measures can be said to be humble and not too high-sounding. It is not necessary to enact specific laws like Britain to control investment. It is only necessary for the government to make up its mind and implement them separately, and the current situation of speculation and chaos can be resolved by at least half. Fortunately, the Political Consultative Conference has come to a successful conclusion, and all parties have promised to cooperate. We believe that there will be solutions to politics in the future. If there are solutions to politics, then there will of course be solutions to law and order, transportation, finance, etc. The speculation and chaos of the past few months can always be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>There is only one point that the central and local authorities must not think that the Consultative Conference has ended, the government must be reorganized, and everyone should have the psychology of a five-day magistrate, delaying what should be done quickly. It must be known that a small disease that is not treated can become a serious illness over time. If the evil of the speculation market is not rooted out when the waves first rise, it will eventually flood and cause a major disaster. We do not want the authorities to be only guests who try to put out the fire after the house is burned down, but we hope that they will quickly come to bend the chimney and remove the firewood.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Northeast China is Increasingly Complex: "East Mongolia Autonomous Government" Suddenly Announces its Appearance; the Issue of Soviet Troop Withdrawal is Being Negotiated and Handled</h3>

Therefore, when discussing matters that may endanger peace and international security, the Soviet people maintain such a concerned attitude. Our people, whenever necessary, will remain vigilant without the slightest懈怠. Mr. Molotov also stated: "For the sake of world peace, the Soviet Union is always prepared to maintain cooperation with all peace-loving nations, large and small. The ruling classes in certain countries, encouraged by imperialism, are prepared to wage a third great war. There are no such warmongering adventurers within the Soviet Union. Those who truly uphold peace and security should know that the Soviet Union is a steadfast ally and a pillar of security."</p>

The matter of transporting troops is still continuing. The withdrawal of the Japanese and the transportation of troops may be presided over by the Chinese Navy in April of this year after the Chinese Navy receives adequate training. When talking about the situation of the US Navy in China, Kirk said that the US Navy has no so-called bases in China, but only uses Chinese ports for work. There are currently about 170 large and small US military vessels in China. After the war, the US Navy in China has increased significantly, many times more than before the war. When asked about the issue of transferring Japanese warships to China, Kirk said that it has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>Donation of Famous Porcelain from Past Dynasties to the Government</h3>
<p>Mr. Guo Baochang, courtesy name Shi Wu, is the most famous porcelain collector in China in recent years. Throughout his life, he collected more than 400 pieces of famous porcelain from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. He died in Beiping in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), leaving a will stating that his lifelong efforts must be preserved and quietly await the restoration of the national territory so that the entire collection can be donated to the government. When President Song of the Executive Yuan arrived in Beiping in early January, Guo's son, Zhao Jun, met with President Song and stated his willingness to inherit his father's legacy and donate the entire collection to the government. Yesterday, Mr. Guo Zhao Jun came to Shanghai and formally requested that personnel be sent to inventory the collection. It is reported that President Song considered this collection of ancient porcelain to be of great importance to Chinese culture and praised Guo for his deep understanding of righteousness, and immediately sent personnel to inventory and safeguard the collection in Beiping in preparation for opening a room for exhibition and display.</p>

<h3>The US Military's Wartime Ranks Will Be Revised; Senior Officers Will Be Demoted by One to Two Levels</h3>
<p>The US government is demobilizing many officers and soldiers who joined the military during the war, and the standing army that existed in the US during peacetime is still serving in the military. However, the current US military ranks are all wartime ranks, so the US government will revise them. All senior officers will be demoted by one to two levels. The first person here to be changed from Brigadier General to Colonel was General Middleton, who we knew best during the trial of Japanese war criminals. Later, Generals Carver, Eaker, and others were also referred to by their peacetime ranks. Former Armsted, who was hosting a reception at the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, said: "I was a Lieutenant General during the war, then demoted to Major General, now I am a Brigadier General, and I don't know what I will be later."</p>

<h3>American War Crimes Tribunal: Trial of Ishihara and Miki Ordered, Remanded for Scheduled Retrial</h3>
<p>The five-member committee formed by the American War Crimes Tribunal yesterday morning, at the American Military Tribunal in Tilanqiao, conducted the trial of two Japanese war criminals: Ishihara, a translator, and Lieutenant Miki. The trial began at nine o'clock, with Ishihara being tried first. Ishihara, 36 years old, served as the chief translator at the Wusong and Jiangwan concentration camps during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. He was accused of using various cruel tortures to abuse American prisoners in the concentration camps, such as waterboarding, beatings, and inhumane torture that caused them to lose consciousness. Today, the American military charged him with seven counts. The prosecuting attorney was Captain Gurney Landt, and the defense attorney was Captain Mollerly. The defense attorney requested a two-week preparation period, which was granted, so a retrial is scheduled for a later date. At half past nine, Miki was tried. From 1942 to 1945, Miki worked in a concentration camp near Shenyang. During that time, 1,200 Americans were imprisoned there and subjected to Miki's abuse. He also killed an American expatriate named Jones. The American military charged him with nine counts. Today was the preliminary hearing, and he was remanded for a scheduled retrial.</p>

It is reported that the bidding process has now closed, with a considerable number of bidders. The bidding will be opened on the 12th, and within ten days thereafter, construction is expected to begin at the old sites on Pushan Road, Qimei Road, and Xietu Road.

<h3>Rumors Fuel Buying Spree: Gold Prices Rise Steadily, Sichuan Banks Provide Continuous Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, reports of the American [unclear character] and gold exports stirred up a buying frenzy, regardless of the veracity of the news. Rumors of "Sun Yat-sen notes" circulated, and major players in the industry scrambled to buy, hoping to squeeze out the Sichuan bank's short positions, leading to successive price increases. The market opened in the morning carrying forward the previous day's momentum, rising to 1.13 million. Initially, the market was relatively flat, but later, with concerted boosting by gold industry groups and the pursuit of retail investors, the price gradually rose from 1.125 million. The 1.21 million mark saw considerable back-and-forth, but ultimately, with strong investor sentiment, the price surged to over 1.23 million at noon. Sichuan banks aggressively sold into the rally, with the noon close at 1.22 million, a sharp increase of 153,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the price briefly hit a high of around 1.24 million, with Sichuan banks providing a substantial supply, and credit gradually tightening. The price ultimately retreated to around 1.19 million. Current futures contracts were traded, but not extensively. Gold ornaments were priced at 130,000, silver ingots at 1,200, and silver dollars also rose to around 690. Credit tightened yesterday due to speculative funds concentrating on gold stocks, with interest rates around 10% to 14%.</p>
<p>The US dollar market thrived alongside the gold market, with the premium over gold widening to over 710. Many people sold gold to buy US dollars. The market opened in the morning at 1,610, struggling significantly throughout the day, and rising to 1,720 at noon. However, in the afternoon, it declined along with the gold price to around 1,680, resulting in an increase of 80 compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained sluggish as before, although the premiums on new (1) and (2) series were slightly higher. Old notes were unchanged, new (2) series were up slightly at 2 yuan, and (1) series were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Surge Continues</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market continued to flourish. Driven by major players in the securities industry, there were hopes for further price increases in various stocks. However, some speculative funds moved towards gold bonds, causing several market setbacks. Overall, Mayar was more popular than Wing On, with active profit-taking. Small-cap and obscure stocks were also highly profitable. Wing On opened in the morning at 2,560, retreating to 2,320 after the opening, and rising to 2,630 at noon, with the noon close at 2,560. Mayar opened in the morning at 1,850, declining from 1,890 to 1,720 after the opening. At noon, it broke through the 2,000 mark, reaching 2,030, with the noon close at 1,950. King Fook opened in the morning at 115, retreating from 120 to 107 after the opening, and then breaking through 120 again at noon. As a result, Wing On was up 140, Mayar 120, Xinhe 40, and King Fook 10, compared to the previous close. Other stocks also rose by about 10%.</p>
<p>The external environment aided buying, and speculative funds flocked back. From the opening, large and small stocks were being snapped up by securities firms and money shops, and foreign investors also re-entered the market. All stocks closed at high prices at noon, with results showing increases of 10% to 20% compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Hit New Highs Again</h3>
<p>Since government bonds turned positive from lows the day before, major players have actively pushed prices up. Yesterday, rumors in the gold market [unclear character] further fueled buying. Class C bonds opened in the morning at 2,050, with supply exceptionally scarce, rising to a new high of 2,270, before turning sideways. However, the bid-ask spread was very wide, resulting in greater price fluctuations. The overall trend fluctuated between 2,150 and 2,250, with the noon close at 2,220. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each rose 60, Class C bonds 270, Class D bonds 70, and Class E bonds 140. Major players flocked to popular issues, resulting in relatively weaker gains for less well-known bonds. There was some absorption by foreign investors, and the trend was particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Both Japonica and Indica Rice Rebound</h3>
<p>Rice prices rose due to the rebound of gold, strengthening investor confidence. Japonica, Indica, and glutinous rice all rebounded by 400-500. Flour also added 400-500. The oil market was weak but rebounded, up by 1,000. However, soybeans remained flat, and soybean cake rose slightly, up by 100. Cottonseed cake was brisk due to fuel demand, soaring by 500.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Weaving Prices Continue to Increase: Yarn Market Sees Strong Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw a sharp rebound. Although few customers made purchases, the industry's appetite was very strong, and the market saw strong buying, sweeping away the lethargic situation during the previous day's red market. This upward surge was entirely caused by the previous day's sudden increase of 10,000-20,000 in the list price of the Spinning and Weaving Company. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn traded at 700,000, an increase of 50,000. 20-count miscellaneous brands rose by about 40,000. 42-count yarn was particularly popular, rising by 100,000. Weaving factories heard that the list price of the Spinning and Weaving Company's 42-count variegated yarn increased by another 40,000 yesterday afternoon, and it is expected that the yarn market will be even stronger today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk and satin market was stimulated by rising gold prices and rose. Artificial silk 120-Day Bridge spot goods were quoted as high as 1.45 million, with transactions at 1.38 million, and a final price of 1.4 million. Warehouse warrants soared with the spot goods, with transactions at 960,000-970,000 and later at 980,000. Due to the extreme shortage of 120 miscellaneous brands, prices were on par with the Tianqiao brand. Factory managers hoarding goods were reluctant to sell, resulting in prices but no transactions. Silk fabrics followed the raw materials higher, with market prices made. American Yaxin quilt covers were quoted at 1.02 million per hundred for buying and 1.05 million for selling, but no transactions were made. Dachen Gege brocade was made at 3,340 per yard, Minsheng brocade at 13,000 per piece, and Linji wax feather yarn traded at 1,300 per yard.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Red Market Pricing Agreed</h3>
<p>The Tung oil red market was only priced yesterday. Originally, it was sufficient to supply foreign sales, but domestic sales oil is also called Tung, so the pricing does not distinguish between domestic and foreign sales, and the average price is 60,000 per market. However, the market is dominated by foreign firms, and although domestic sales are said to be in season for spring sales, the quantity is actually not as large as foreign sales, so market ups and downs still depend on the prosperity of foreign sales. As for Hongjiang Tung oil, the genuine Xihong has disappeared for eight years. Although several companies have resumed operations, the goods have not arrived, so it cannot be priced. The pricing discussed today is the locally produced Hongjiang Tung oil, with the price of each barrel being 47,800 yuan.</p>

<h3>Launching a Ruthless Attack on Decadent Music</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>I am puzzled and deeply perplexed that in Shanghai today, after the victory, we still have the pervasive broadcasting and circulation of "decadent music" that contains narcotic and poisonous elements!</p>
<p>Every time, on the streets, in the theaters, and especially every day at home when listening to music records broadcast on the radio, I am constantly assailed by things like "I Want You," "Don't Leave Me," or things like "Seagull" and "A Toast to My Love"; and even hear them several times a day. Not only does it disgust me to the extreme, but I am also made dizzy by them! How can Shanghai, which is supposedly "concentrated with musical talent," still have the same old face? Are the musicians of Shanghai (the real musicians) really willing to let the dregs of music—jazz songs—continue to run rampant like this for the long term?</p>
<p>"Victory is not rest." Indeed, victory is even less a return to the distorted prosperity of song, dance, and extravagance, but rather requires us to redouble our efforts in all areas to complete the arduous task of national reconstruction. Otherwise, our country, which is ranked among the strong nations, will still be a "gilded lily" on the outside, leaving an embarrassing appearance!</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese music itself, it is still stuck in a nascent stage. Other countries have "Symphonies," what do we have? Other countries have "Operas," what do we have? Other countries have produced great musical masters like Beethoven and Wagner, who have we produced? We don't need to discuss these backward situations much, everyone knows them. It is more a question of how to establish our national music from now on, how to establish the orthodox music that our country and nation needs, which is undoubtedly the effort expected of our musicians, the more enthusiastic advocacy and assistance expected of our wise government. I think this is an urgent and meaningful task.</p>
<p>Therefore, first I suggest—</p>
<p>Launch a ruthless attack on "decadent music"!</p>
<p>First, I urge the government authorities to quickly ban these "decadent music," destroy these poisonous records. We do not completely lack majestic, inspiring, and patriotic songs, nor do we completely lack sublime art songs, and in Shanghai there are places to record records. I urge the authorities in charge of cultural propaganda to quickly record these kinds of songs, replace them, and distribute them to various radio stations and theaters.</p>
<p>Second, I urge the government to investigate the producers of these poisonous songs.</p>
<p>We all know that the "composers" of these poisonous songs are mostly traitors of the "music world," who not only speculate and numb people's minds, but also willingly spread poison and whitewash peace for the enemy puppets.</p>
<p>After clearing away these obstacles, it's time to talk about our own efforts:</p>
<p>First, I urge our composers and performers to recognize their sacred task, to produce more so-called "Chinese-style" musical works that are suitable for our national conditions and needs, and to play more of these kinds of musical works; not just playing Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony" and "Fate Symphony," Chopin's "Waltzes" and "Serenades," and Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsodies" today; and still playing these sublime pieces that the Chinese don't easily understand tomorrow. Although Chinese musical works are nascent, but after you play them for everyone to enjoy with your skillful techniques and profound cultivation, you cannot say that they will not have any effect at all. At the same time, I urge the musicians not to harbor any prejudices and to "musicians despise each other," but to cooperate sincerely and work together under the single banner of "establishing national music" to create and work hard.</p>
<p>Second, I urge the government authorities and people from all walks of life to attach importance to and enthusiastically promote music. There is no need to talk about the old clichés like "how important music is" and "how music is related to the future of the nation." Everyone can provide a satisfactory explanation. However, according to what I have personally seen, in today's Shanghai, where the level of culture is quite high, almost every concert is sparsely attended. Such a lack of enthusiasm, such coldness and desolation, the income of a sublime concert is not only not comparable to that of a movie, but not even comparable to that of a *bengbengxi* (a type of local opera)! Stirred by the scene, it pains me to say this! We cannot say that it is not because people from all walks of life do not understand and do not attach importance to musical art, and that the government authorities do not advocate it enough. Therefore, in order to help establish and develop our national music, on the one hand, we must ask people from all walks of life to pay attention to music, because it is a sublime art, which can not only "change customs and habits," but also cultivate character and temperament; on the other hand, we must ask the government authorities to advocate it more enthusiastically, cultivate more musical talents, and mobilize meaningful musical activities. Then, this will not only be a ruthless blow to "decadent music," but also a thorough and effective one.</p>
<h3>The Old Man Selling Sundries</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>——One of the Street Ballads</p>
<p>Dong-dong, dong-dong, dong-dong...</p>
<p>An old white-haired man selling sundries comes running over——</p>
<p>Shaking a long-handled small drum in his hand,</p>
<p>Carrying a huge cargo box on his back,</p>
<p>(Bigger than his body by three or four times!)</p>
<p>Looking like a little ant</p>
<p>Carrying a golden blowfly,</p>
<p>Or a small piece of meat.</p>
<p>Dong-dong, dong-dong, dong-dong...</p>
<p>He runs and shakes with effort,</p>
<p>Sweating profusely</p>
<p>Still calling out his wares incessantly.</p>
<p>Old white-haired man!</p>
<p>Steady your steps,</p>
<p>Straighten your back,</p>
<p>Beware that the "burden of life"</p>
<p>Crushes your old bones!</p>
<h3>A Couple Flying Together (12)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After Mo Sheng had prepared the dishes, Old Master Mo and Old Master Weng began to drink together. Old Master Mo always downed his cup in one go, while Old Master Weng was more interested in smoking than drinking. Smoking was to Old Master Weng as drinking was to Old Master Mo. His philosophy was: tobacco could cloud his consciousness, so he wouldn't think about too many things. In the life of swallowing clouds and spitting fog, he could live dimly and peacefully.</p>
<p>"By the way, Big Brother, did you call me here for anything else?" Old Master Weng remembered that Mo Sheng had told him that Old Master Mo had something to discuss with him, so he asked this.</p>
<p>"It's nothing else. Last night I had a strange dream, and today there have been many ominous omens. I'm very suspicious in my heart, so I specially invited you here to help me interpret it."</p>
<p>After Old Master Mo finished speaking, he drank several cups of wine in a row, and then tried hard to recall the scene in the dream, and told Old Master Weng in detail about the things he had encountered today, and he especially emphasized some of the phenomena of this newborn daughter, narrating with a doubtful tone.</p>
<p>"How can there be such coincidences in the world? I dreamed of a bird like a yellow oriole flying out of my body, and then today I gave birth to a daughter; and after she fell to the ground, when she cried, it was exactly like the cry of that bird in the dream; and when I saw her for the first time, she cried out in the same voice. Don't you think that's strange? I thought to myself: maybe a demon reincarnated? When people are unlucky, all kinds of unlucky things can happen. Because of this, I was unhappy for a long time." A painful expression appeared on Old Master Mo's face again.</p>
<p>"Haha..." Old Master Weng laughed after listening. After a while, he said without thinking, "You are simply being driven crazy by your wife——" At this point, he quickly lowered his voice. "What's so strange about that? Usually, don't we often compare girls to birds? You dreamed of a bird flying out of your body, isn't that a verification of the birth of your precious daughter today? Since their voices are the same, then maybe your daughter was indeed a bird in her previous life, and now she has been reborn as a precious daughter. You can't even say your daughter isn't an ordinary person! Big Brother, let me congratulate you with a drink!" After saying that, Old Master Weng filled a glass of wine and drank it all in one gulp with Old Master Mo.</p>
<p>"As for you saying that the bird looks like a yellow oriole, according to my guess, my niece will definitely have the advantages of my wife when she grows up——"</p>
<p>Before Old Master Mo could let him finish speaking, he quickly asked:</p>
<p>"What 'advantages'?"</p>
<p>"She can hum a few lines of Peking Opera or something." Old Master Weng smiled and made another predictive explanation.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Old Master Mo replied with a half-believing and half-doubting sound. But after thinking for a while, he couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Then, why does she cry as soon as she sees me? Could it be that we two, father and daughter, have no connection?"</p>

<h3>Students from Other Provinces Come to Shanghai to Study: Exploring the Advantages and Disadvantages of Maritime Schools, Extravagant Aristocrats Are Indeed Unacceptable</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have only recently come to Shanghai from the countryside, so of course I don't know anything about Shanghai. There are so many schools in Shanghai, making it even more unclear which schools are good? The quality of the school is very important for the future of the students. In order to be cautious, I specially ask your newspaper to indicate which middle schools in Shanghai West are better, and are not for the children of extravagant aristocrats, because the tuition fees of those private schools are too expensive for ordinary students to afford. Your newspaper has always aimed to serve society, and will definitely be able to tell the readers. It will be extremely fortunate! Sincerely, A Shanghai West Reader: Ming Lukuan</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) You say there are many schools in Shanghai, but actually there are not many. Because the population of Shanghai is five million, the number of students enrolled is of course considerable. But at present, the number of people who are out of school and the illiterate are everywhere. The reasons are very complex, but there are still too few schools. That is the first point. The quality of the school cannot be criticized in general terms. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, due to financial difficulties, lack of materials, simple equipment, poor teachers, abnormal teaching and management..., it was difficult for general schools to be run well. After the restoration, the education authorities thoroughly rectified and gradually improved the various past situations, and school affairs are expected to improve. That is the second point. As for the so-called extravagant aristocrats, I think that after rectifying the style of study in the future, there will definitely be no more of these bad phenomena. The tuition fees have been stipulated by the Education Bureau and have a certain standard. This is the third point. As for which school in Shanghai West suits your taste? That's hard to say too. Please read the enrollment advertisements of various schools in this newspaper, and you can do whatever you want.</p>
