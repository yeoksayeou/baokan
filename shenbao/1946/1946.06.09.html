<h3>財政收支會議決定　田賦徵實延長一年　主席訓勉注意人民痛苦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕改訂全國財政收支系統會議，八日晨繼續舉行審查會，討論昨未完畢之第一三兩組提案，對於繼續征實之問題，詳加研討，眾均以農村窮困實況為詞，且此次行政院將無法維持。下午三時召開第三次大會，由徐部長主持，蔣主席並於三時三十七分蒞會，衆均肅立致敬，主席步至台上，帶上眼鏡，端坐的三分鐘，注視會塲四周，旋起立演講，至四時零五分完畢，旋即離去。主席訓詞內容，特別對征借延長一年之事，予以說明，並盼各省代表返抵各地後，以此意轉達各縣市，蓋在此一年內，實最困難之階段，此乃關係國計民生，國家存亡，大家一定可能明瞭而協助完成此事也。旋並舉三　事，爲各代表今後工作重心，計（一）清丈地畝，（二）淸査戶口，（）三整編保甲，詞畢，衆極感奮。會議乃續作審査之報吿，第一二兩組提案，除第一案及各案略作修改外，均照審査意見通過，九日休會。十日上午十時續開大會，可能於下午閉幕。第一案對免賦及征借部份審查意見爲「其應免田賦，分三年平均减免，本年田賦征費及征借糧食，各照定額征三分之二」，改為「其應免田賦分二年，平均減免，本年田賦征實及征信糧食，各照定額征二分之一」，旋因主席對此之訓示，故再提討論，最後決定照審查意見呈主席核定。又本晚俞徐兩部長共宴出席代表。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕蔣主席八日下午三時半，出席財政收支系統會議，對出席人員一百七十餘人訓詞，首謂：此次會議不僅釐定中央與地方財政收支系統，而且可以決定今後國計民生之方針，使命至為重大。各位在開會期中，集思廣益，有許多重要之決議，希望各位回去後一一實行，然後才能解除人民之痛苦，也才能使國家之財政早日恢復常軌。此次會議決定田賦征實延長一年，此舉對完成復員工作實爲必要，不過地方糧食常局在征實時，要特別體念人民之痛苦，减少征收手續，嚴禁苛擾，以期便利予民。蔣主席最後提及丈量土地，調査戶口，登記財產三事，認係建國之基本工作，並希望大家一致努力，完成這三項重要工作，來奠定建國之基礎。</p>
<h3>延安開聯席會議毛澤東晉京說尙未證實　莫德專等訪馬歇爾會談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據消息靈通者言：陸定一昨晚返抵延安晤毛澤東後，當晚延安中共總部曾舉行一高級幹部會議，討論至午夜始畢。八日上下午延安中共主腦續舉行聯席會議，聞本日會議除繼續討論國府主席停戰公吿所列有關停戰，復路，整編統編軍隊各項重要問題外，並將中共代表國周恩來等所擬之停戰建議，提出討論。就過去三十六小時間，中共代表及自稱「第三者」人士之言論觀察，中共顯已將其注意力集中於所謂修改整軍方案中原定東北整軍「五與一」之比例，希再保全東北共軍旣威之優勢兵額，中共旣已將未來談判之重點置於軍事，其今後之動向，至堪注意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕今晚此間盛傳，周恩來有明晚返京之可能，並傳毛澤東即擬來京，晋謁蔣主席，答候馬歇爾，以便與各方作進一步之懇談，如局勢確有好轉可能，毛氏或將留京，親自指揮出席軍事三人小紐會及政協綜合小組會之中共代表，以免遇重大難題發生時，往返請示躭誤時日，此訊傳出後，京中觀察家曾作下列之揣測，（一）中共將變更戰略及政略，以和平攻勢，爭取國人之同情，（二）中共將把握此稍縱即逝之寳貴時機，使用多種軟性方法，成極濃厚之和平空氣，使政府與美方性曠神怡，沈洏於和局而無法自脫，使第三者舌敝唇焦，戀　於機會，而沾沾自喜，以達成其拖延現局之目的。惟截至今晚止，毛澤東能吾即偕風恩來來京，尙無法證明。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕據悉：民盟梁漱溟·羅隆基·沈鈞儒·章伯鈞·黃炎培。靑年黨李璜·陳啓天·莫德惠·八日向馬使提出下列之意見，（一）延長休戰時間，（二）休戰期間必須同時顧及軍事與政治配合解決。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕參政會秘書長邵力子，八日晚車赴滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕八日午後四時，社會賢達莫德惠·民盟代表梁漱溟·沈鈞儒·黃炎培·章伯鈞·羅隆基·靑年黨代表李璜·陳啓天·同往海寗路會晤馬歇爾，談話約二小時，對團結和平間題交換意見，甚爲融洽。各代表自馬帥處辭出後，復在鳳頤村靑年黨辦事處商談甚久。</p>
<h3>軍調部籌商整編復員　明日舉行整軍會　東北調處工作尙待開始</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕執行部定本月十日舉行整軍會議，討論整編復員等四項議題，如停戰半月內，國共問題全部解決，則執行部之整軍工作，即可迅速開展，並可望先在東北開始，最近蔣主席曾電執行部指示，整軍進行必附時限，吾則將不知何年何月始能整編，蓋目前國軍第二期長江區整眾，六月底即完成，華北國軍預定第三期七至八月進行。中共方面迄今尙未提出，擬保留軍隊番號及名册，共方解釋謂衝突尙未停止，且交通通訊均感困難，故不克提出，惟稱局部之整編，已在若干地區進行。中共與美方合辦之張家口軍事訓練學校，刻已先行進行訓練譯員百餘人，以便開辦後，代美籍敎官翻譯其敎學於受訓官兵。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕執行部增設副委員，政府方面內定蔡文治，中共方面本內定饒漱石，因饒將赴長春，有改羅瑞卿說，（按蔡羅俱係參謀長）美方何人尙無所聞。</p>
<h3>延安解放日報著論強烈反美　南京中央日報予以痛駁</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕宣傳休戰聲中，五日延安廣播一篇解放日報的社論，首爲美國應即停止助長中國內戰，不僅盡情詆毁政府，且誣蔑盟邦美國，其居心叵測，中外人士極爲注意，茲誌其大意如下：美國總統杜魯門，在去年十二月十五日所發表的對華政策聲明，結束了赫爾利政策，因此當去年十二月來華的美國特使馬歇爾將軍，根據上述方針，促成中國的停戰與政治協商會議的召開時，凡百工作也獲得中國人民的信任與熱忱合作　按照三國外長莫斯科會議的約束，美國應當停止並收回對於國民黨政府內戰與獨裁政策的任何援助，尤其是軍事援助，也只有這樣，馬歇爾將關於停止中國內戰的努力，才不致成爲一種徒然的裝飾。</p>
<p>但是事實完全相反，當中國的內戰和恐怖統治，一天比一天嚴重的時候，美國政府中的反動派，對於中國反動派所支持的國民黨政府，却是一天比一天地繼續加强援助，特別是繼續在軍事運輸與軍火供給上，加以狂烈的援助。很明顯的，華北和東北的內戰，是由美國代替國民黨運送軍隊和軍火之後，才能發生與加劇的，如果沒有美國的軍事運輸，中國反動派要在東北，華北進行大規模的內戰，猶根本沒有可能。</p>
<p>從日本投降以後（就是說在一內戰中而不是在抗戰中）到現在，美國廠天的海軍和陸空軍駐在中國各地，屢次聲明不撤退，而屢次延期，現在連美軍的家屬都運來中國，表示美軍已經把中國看作他們的基地了。他們在中國不但帮助內戰的發動者運兵，並帮助他們看守和修理港口，鐵路，礦山，訓練他們作戰和使用美國供給的轟炸機，軍艦，坦克，大砲及其他各種殺人利器，直到進行特務工作。美國在中國抗戰結束，內戰開始以後，給內戰發動者裝備了四十例美械師（美在抗戰期間只裝備了二十個師，這二十個師的絕大部份，也是用於內戰，並未用於抗戰）組織了海軍和空軍，供給他們大量的飛機，艦船，火箭砲，大砲，坦克，汽油以及其他一切戰爭物資，直至軍官和士兵的日用品，很明的，沒有美國這些軍火的援助，中國的反動派是不能進行大規模內戰的。</p>
<p>在上述情況之下，中國人民不得不懷疑到今天的事實，究竟是中國反動派的兇惡內戰政策要求美國的狂烈軍事干涉還是美國的狂烈軍事干涉要求中國反動派的兇惡內戰政策，中國人民不得不注意到美國的軍事干涉，是不會沒有帝國主義目的的，說不定那一天美國將要向中國索取軍事基地和政治，經濟權利，使中國實際上降爲美國的保護國和殖民地，而中國的反動派之不惜犧牲國家民族利益和人民生命財產，來換得美國軍事干涉，以鞏固自己的獨裁地位，乃是一種漢奸　國賊的行爲，無論如何，美國政府中反動派的軍事干涉，是危窖着中國的民族安全，顯然與杜魯門不以軍事干涉影影中國任何內爭過程的宣言，和馬歇爾停止中國內戰的努力不相符合，因此，美國的這種錯誤政策，在美國國內與在中國，均遭到各方面的批評和責難。</p>
<p>中國人民在對日作戰結束之後，仍然被外國武器所屠殺，這就是美國的武器，中國人民今天的災難，根本上即是美國的反動份子製造與助長中國內戰的政策所賜予，美國的軍事干涉，使杜魯門聲明中許多莊嚴詞句變爲不能令人信任，使美國對中國內戰的調解地位，令人懷疑。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕南京中央日報今日社論，以「狂妄的宜傳戰」爲題，痛駁解放日報五日社論，首謂：這篇社論突破了宣傳休戰的約定，在烈的發動了反美運動，激昂的攻擊我國民政府，我們只徵引其中的一兩句話，就可見延安對美國與我國民政府的看法，他們在誣蔑美國干涉中國內政以後，指出中國現狀是「中國反動派的兇惡內戰政策，要求美國的在烈軍事援助，美國的狂烈軍事干涉要求中國反動派的兇惡內戰政策」，他們指斥「說不定那一天美國將要向中國索取軍事基地和政治，經濟權利，使中國實際上降爲美國的保護國和殖民地」，他們指出。「美國的軍事干涉，是危害着中國的民族安全，危害着中國的和平與民主，危書着中美友誼與世界和平」，只要是愛中國的中國人，聽見了共產黨這樣的在妄宜傳戰的言論，一定可以判斷共產黨即將發動一種險惡的反美運動和反抗政府的行爲，一定可以看出我們對於政府在東北的軍隊停戰十五日，以促共產黨踐　他們以前參加的協議，這一件事還沒有過份樂觀的道理。</p>
<p>自日本投降以來，共產黨屢次發動反美運動，解放日報這一篇社論，是歷次反動宣傳戰最强烈的文守，要們首先要探求共產黨爲什麽要這樣强烈的反美，我們知道共產黨然最大的企圖，是要破壞亞洲大陸安定力之中國，而美國的世界政策，是希望並帮助中國建設一個統一強大民主自由的國家，以達成其安全亞洲的使命。反之，共產黨的信條是「混亂是革命的資本」，共產黨所祈求者，就是中國混亂與世界不安，爲此不惜挑起中國的內爭，爲此也不惜挑起第三次世界大戰，共產黨的目的是正興中國建國者的目的相反，也正與中美兩國合作的目的相反。因此，他們屢次發動反美運動，而最近的將來，且有此歷次更爲險惡的反美運動發生。</p>
<p>該報次謂：今者，馬歇爾將軍爲了中國的和平安全民主法治，正在作最後最大最堅毅的努力，而共產黨竟發動正面指斥馬歇爾將軍的宣傳戰。這一篇宣傳戰文字，關於馬歇爾將軍的二部分，沒有一句是眞實的，但是今天我們必須指出之一事，就是馬歇爾將軍的仲裁力之加强，乃是中國唯一合法政府之國民政府鑒於軍事衝突調處執行部的職能如不加强，）不足以完成調處的責任，所以希望爲歇爾將軍以堅毅公正的態度，爲中國國內軍事衝突作更有力之仲裁，這絕不是美國干涉中國的內政。馬歇爾將軍這一使命，絕對沒有可資指責的暇疵。</p>
<p>在日本投降之後，蓋碗國在中國繼續活動，以結束中國戰場應該結束的事項，這一任務是正確合法，値得每一個中國人的讚許，而美軍助同運送中國政府軍隊開入東北，是助同中國回復東北領土主權。東北問題惟有在中國主權之下，以國際合作，門戶開放政策提供其資源與市塲，爲世界人類繁榮而使用，纔能够根本解決。我們深信，國民政府無意在東北採取封鎖政策，散布有害於遠東和平世界安全的種子。我們認為，第一個中國人，對於美蘇兩大友邦，都應當一視同仁，因此，明白了這兩點，我們看出了共產黨反美運動，對於中國立國之道對於中美蘇合作，以安定遠東與世界的期望都是有害的。解放日報之攻擊國民政府，是平常的事，但是我們很驚異他們這一回却提出「民族安全」的名辭，我們要向他們「民主盟軍」在東北的行動是不是爲了民族安全，他們在東北一點的作為，那一點是民族性的。我相信他們在提出「民族」的字樣之時，他們心中是慚愧與卑怯的。最後我們希望共產黨，爲了中國立國的基礎，爲了遠東和平，世界安全的爭取與保持，冷靜反省，熱烈自覺，幡然改變他們製造混亂，破壞和平的策略。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>衹剩十三天了！</h3>
<p>—停戰應該不是緩兵吧？</p>
<p>六月七日正午起應該有效的東北停戰命令，使此十五天成爲中國政局化險爲夷的轉捩時期。這十五天，一剎那已過去了兩天，今天算起，衹剩十三天了！可是中共代表周恩來陸定一兩氏偏沒有權作談判，前天還要專飛延安請示，今明能否返京，尚不可知。而周陸兩氏在離京以前，却又對新聞記者宣稱：『談判中必然牽連到東北乃至全國性的政治問題，需要更多時間，』這彷彿暗示十五天內未必一定能達成談判的任務，預先爲『拖延』政策留一地步。中共代表，在表上雖竭力表示願望『使暫時休戰成爲長期休戰，』但我們本於過去痛苦的經驗，依然不敢十分情愛觀，尤其不敢過度興奮，因爲倘使談判的雙方或任何一方如果沒有化戾氣爲詳和的誠意，則所謂『停戰』大有變爲『緩兵』的可能。我們真要提防希望之後的再度『失望』啊！</p>
<p>中共要人，近來總說願意『無條件停戰』，而實則他們舉出來的條件特別多；條件多，不稀奇，只要談妥算數，究竟比不舉條件，不開談判爲好。現在居然能停戰十五天，重啓談判之門，人民正在高興，可是中共在延安的新華通訊社用及解放日報，七日社論中却絲毫沒有提及此事，顯得冷淡之至。這倒奇怪了。解放日報不但不提及中共代表所稱由於『主觀努力爭取』得來的『暫時休戰』，表示輕視這一回事，而且反在社論中痛責美國有『帝國主義』的侵略干涉的企圖，要求美國立即撤退駐華軍隊，甚至誣詆『華北及東北之內戰，實因美國運輸國軍及火所造成，』又硬說『或有一日，美國將向中國要求軍事根據地，政治及經濟特權，使中國實際上淪爲美國之保護國或殖民地。』這種無中生有的惡意宣傳，不知其用意何在。實則中共代表對於和平談判中馬歇爾特使的仲裁權問題，旣堅次反對於前，而又在東北停戰命令頒發有效之日，使其解放日報竭力攻擊居間調停之美國於後，其用心所在，縱不說穿，明眼人也當可瞭然。</p>
<p>美國在戰時爲我們的盟邦，世所周知。目前在中國的日俘日僑尚未撤盡，中國接收領土主權尚未完成任務，我們可以說，美國士兵在中國之作戰任務，也還未完全終了。美國之協助運輸國軍，整編國軍，和遣送日俘日僑歸國，也均爲抗戰盟友根據協定所應盡的援助義務。中國人民，對於美國當局和將士這種爲了保障勝利和維持和平而作的努力，沒有不致由衷的感佩，同時也沒有不想自己多盡些責任，以期無負於盟邦。及中共却偏要用「反美」的論調，煽動中國人民「仇美」的情緒，好像中國除了只許和蘇聯作朋友以外不准有第二個盟友，真是奇突極了！能够辨別朋友好歹的中國人民，相信自己必有主見。中共一面逞兵割據，一面要挾談判，在談判的過程中又常常希望美國居間作一公正的調解者；可是一不如意，就轉眼不認識朋友，不肯讓馬帥有仲裁權，甚至誣詆美國要以中國爲保護國，以爲這樣一罵，美國朋友一定避嫌走開，可以不再來勸阻我們的「內戰」。中共如此這般，明明又似乎不想望談判有什麼圓滿結果。我們知道，此十五天中所談的三個問題：（一）東北完全停戰的詳細辦法；（二）完全恢復交通的詳細辦法；（三）獲得確實基礎，迅即實施全國軍隊復員及整編統編的協定。試問「如果政府和中共對某一問題意見有所出入時，假使沒有居間仲裁者最後說」句話來作決定，這談判如何會有結局？又如何能够圓滿？這不是又引到了中共代表所說「一方堅持要求，對方絕不通融，結果惟有衝突」的老路上來嗎？中共倘仍本着這種心理，用反對馬帥有仲裁權的辦法，來應付停戰期間的談判，那末此十五天的停戰很有變爲「緩兵」之計的可能。中共報紙之所以在此時際，竭力鼓吹「反美」甚至「仇美」，其深意原來如此。我們只要留心附和中共自號「民主」的政客今後幾天的論調如何，便可「思過半矣」！</p>
<p>但，無論如何，我們要提醒國人一句話：中國抗戰勝利以後，外蒙獨立了，旅大等於「中蘇公用」了，中長鐵路也歸「中蘇共同經營」了，東北的工礦機器都被人家搬運一空了。這都是「中蘇同盟友好條約」簽訂以後的鐵的事實！中國這種犧牲，完全與美國無關！中共對這些事件，說過什麼話沒有？誰是帝國主義者？要認清楚一些！</p>

<h3>宋公園外車水馬龍　恭祭先烈宋教仁墓　子覃兩院長追懷往事歷歷如繪　為憲法流血公是第一人</h3>
<p>（本報訊）閘北荒蕪已達九年之宋公園，昨晨忽見車水馬龍之盛。晨九時正，監察院于院長，立法院覃副院長，特偕本市新聞界瀋公展，馮有眞，程滄波，市工務局長趕祖康，監委嚴莊等三十餘人，恭祭革命先烈，報界耆宿管理之責，禮成時已晌午。</p>
<p>蔓草荒煙</p>
<p>昨日淸晨，各與祭者到達後，先在園中察視一週，則到處荒草，該夷已極，祇宋烈士雕像，尙吿完整。像前碑文，有章太炎草書「漁父」二字，「漁父」者，宋烈士字也。碑陰由于右任撰文康寳忠書之碑銘，文曰「先生之死，天下惜之，先生之行，天下知之，吾又何記？爲直筆乎？直筆人戮！爲曲筆乎？曲筆天誅！於虖，九原之淚，天下之血，老友之筆，賊人之鐵。勒之空山，期之良史，銘諸心肝，質諸天地！」宋氏之精神可傳，而于院長當日之悲憤亦可想見。</p>
<p>追懷往事</p>
<p>旋即至宋氏幕前，由于覃兩院長及記者公會獻花圈，行最敬禮，默立久之，轉至宋氏德配方夫人墓致祭。祭畢，于覃二院長至墓前甬道間小憇，驕陽肆虐，揮汗不禁。軍院長乃爲衆述宋氏往事，因略患哮喘，時時小休。覃氏云：民元南京政府期間。國人均欲于倒滿後求和平統一，因陋就簡，遂以總統之職畀諸項城，宋氏爲堅定民國基礎計，遂制定的法，欲以的法爲民國之保障，蓋本黨于當時即認定民主政治爲治國之基礎，毫無置疑之餘地。不意今日尙有人在要求民主，實未明本黨之精神，亦可謂對本黨之侮辱。宋漁父當日若在人世，則民初三年之內，能將敎育交通等國家基礎，皆爲奠定。不意遭袁世凱之忌，卑劣手段，加以暗殺，賚志而沒，全國固無人不爲痛心也。爲憲法而流血者，宋氏爲第一人。故總理輓聯曰：「作民權保障，誰非後死老？」『爲憲法流血，公是第一人！」民七護法之役，于公三原起義，亦即以「法」爲民國之基也。</p>
<p>求仁得仁</p>
<p>于院长綱起立曰：宋氏遇害之日，陳英士，黃克强，及于民本人均在。槍聲起時，以爲英士先生被狙擊，後見係宋先生，乃扶之入鐵路醫院，不意爲時已晚，醫院無人，轉瞬天且破曉，乃扶宋烈士走上三樓，血流旣多，病勢愈劇，終吿不起。當時凶手，武士英，應桂馨，趙秉鈞，洪述祖皆已去世，而洪實於出事後即兎脫，後因在靑島爲一德人所控，涉訟公堂，遂爲敎仁先生公子振呂（今亦故）所得，終於解至北京，執行絞決，宋氏後人，今祇振呂一女矣。</p>

<h3>李澤案判決書理由</h3>
<p>（理由）本件被吿李澤，在僞南京政府行政院所屬之偽全國商業統制總會初任籌備委員，旋改任理事，不獨迭據供承不諱，並有呈案之新中國手册及大陸年鑑之記載可稽。在僞職期內，曾參加僞理監聯席會議多次，除討論會務外，並議決統制物資之方案，發交所屬各統制委員會執行等情，亦爲其所不否認。復有調取唐壽民漢奸案卷宗及僞全國商業統制總會理監聯席會議紀錄，足資參證，事極實爲明瞭。被吿所持之辯解，無非謂：（一）犯罪以行爲標準，名義並非行爲，被吿藉有僞全國商業統制總會普通理事之名義，但無通謀敵國及反抗本國之行爲，依照司法院第三一〇一號解釋，徒名不足入人於罪。（二）偽商統會採理事長集權制，其各部統制工作，則由各統制委員會負担，被吿旣非理事長或常務理事，又非各統制委員會委員，不過普通理事之一，凡理事會所議，僅係輕微人事問題，不涉統制物資實物。（三）被吿充任僞商統會理事，出於僞方之指派，事前無須同意，事後無從拒絕，倘一旦委而去之，勢必公司爲之　粉，人員爲之戕戮，因此嘿然受汚，以蘄保全公司生命財產。　僞商統會非被吿一人所剏置，理事非被吿一人所獨攬，倘被吿因檢舉而受鞫，其他理事因無人過問而倖免，天下之不平，寗復逾茲云云。</p>
<p>關於上開第一點之辯解</p>
<p>查偽南京政府頒布之戰時經濟政策綱領，首先揭　國民政府（指僞政權〕在作戰期內，爲求前方軍需之確保（中略），爰制定戰時經濟政策綱領，其第五項甲款，載各種舊有經濟機構，不適合戰時經濟體制者，一律調整，又僞全國商業統制總會暫行條例略載，全國商業統制總會以協助政府（指偽政府）施行國策爲宗旨，承實業部及其他主管部之命，辦理關於統制物資之收買及軍需物資之採辦等事項；而敵僞簽訂之中日共同宣言，又有兩國以不動之決意與信念，在軍事上政治上及經濟上作完全協力之記戰。是僞全國商業統制總會之設立，實以供給敵方軍需爲主要目的，其爲通謀敵國之經濟機構。昭然若揭。被吿旣參加此項通敵機構，顯有意思上之聯絡，該會理監聯席決議案，爲全體理監事總意思之表現，審其內容，全屬利於敵偽，而不利於本國，被吿旣迭經出席參預議案之表決，自係反抗本國之行爲，核與司法院第三一〇一號解釋所稱，須具有犯罪行爲之條件，正相脗合，何得引此以圖諉卸罪責。</p>
<p>關於被告第二點之辯解</p>
<p>本院核閱僞全國商業統制總會理監聯席會議紀錄，歷次決議，對於統制物資之人選方案，評價收買移動等項，均有詳明之記載，「見卅二年三月十六日四月十六日五月十九日六月十六日十月二十日之會議紀錄決議欄所議者」並非僅係輕微人事問題，被吿雖非該僞會之理事長或常務理事，但旣以理事資格參與決議，自係分祖一部分犯罪工作，即應負相當之罪責。至所任職務是否居於有要地位，乃係量刑問題，與犯罪之成立無涉。</p>
<p>關於被告第三點之辯解</p>
<p>查被告出任偽商統會理事出於指派，幷無强暴脅迫情形，在被吿個人非無抉擇去就之餘地，如謂經理一人之潔已，卽能貽害公司職員之生命，未免不近情理。至謂爲保全公司資產而投僞云云，査保全資產，本不足據爲投僞免罪之理由，況當時滬市鉅大商店雖不附逆而仍繼續營業者，比比皆是，所謂因保產而附僞，顯係託詞。假令被吿最初附逆由於被迫，然担任僞職繼續二年之久，中間非無隱避之機會，何以始終不去，所謂無從拒絕云者，無非飾辯。</p>
<p>關於被告第四點之辯解</p>
<p>查共同犯罪之人，各自負担犯罪責任，不得因其他共犯之尙未檢舉而圖免訴迫，況同案之經陸續檢舉審判者，已不乏人，尤不能以此爲卸罪之口實。綜上所述，被吿充任僞全國商業統制總會理事，參與統制物資議案之表決，該項議案幷移付各偽統制委員會分別實施，自屬有利於敵僞，不利於本國之行爲，卽構成通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國之罪。惟查其被派僞商統會理事，由於原有商業上地位之關係，究與自動附逆者不無區別，且曾應中央人員之策動，捐獻鉅資，（準備供給盟軍登陸之用）籌捐餉精，接濟浦東區忠義救國軍，有軍委會調査統計局駐滬辦事處之信函爲之證明，核其心迹，不無可原。且</p>
<p>所任偽職尙非首要</p>
<p>爰依懲治漢奸條例第二條第六項法定刑範圍內酌量科處，其全部財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。至起訴書所稱被吿將新新公司水汀鐵管交由敵軍，以軍用卡車運去一節，據其辯稱，出賣此項水汀，係經本公司董事長金宗城介紹本市永年街森大鐵廠廠長傳積和與被吿接洽，定價收買，於卅三年九月十八日至廿日，經森大鐵廠借用榮豐紗廠之木炭汽車一輛，由車夫陳鴻恩司機，前往新新公司搬運，賣方由該公司庶務主任黃振光在塲，袁務部長何家良過磅；買方由森大鐵廠職員費萬梓押車監磅，計重三百六十九祖七十零半斤，價金合僞幣二百零七萬零三百四十八元，分三次付淸，一爲上海興業銀行所發僞上海銀行業聯合準備庫卽期撥款單兩張，每張票面偽幣二十五萬元，一爲上開銀行所發同樣撥款單一張，票面六十二萬五千元，一為安孚錢方城　所出，卽期本票一張，票面偽幣一百元，均經解存新大銀行新新公司戶內，常以付款超過貨價僞幣五萬四千六百五十二元，由新新公司簽發新大銀行上開數額支票一紙，付還森大鐵廠，由該廠存入上海企業銀行，再由該行背書，經由僞銀行票據交換所代向新大銀行收款，仍由該銀行就新新公司戶內付訖云云。此項情節，曾據證人金宗城，傅積和，黃振光，何家良，費萬梓，朱鴻恩及新新公司之會計楊深銳，森大鐵廠之賬房韓志雲，新大銀行副經理鄭家駒到庭供述，核與呈案新新森大新大各家之帳籍傳票解款單，以及支票存根之記載，均屬相符。</p>
<p>被告所稱尙非無據</p>

<h3>替亡兒叫冤</h3>
<p>貴報八日社論：「一個十歲左右的小孩子，要讀十多門功課，誤外還有活動，敎脆弱的小孩子身體，怎樣可以支持得下，敎身體特別瘦弱的中國小孩子，如何可以消化得下？」這切合現實的評論，引起了我的悲慘的回憶。我有一個乘乖的七歲的孩子名叫王如，在十三年前的秋天，入小學一年級讀書。那小學辦得很好（當時的愚想），科目齊全，足足有十門功課。玉如很用功，我很歡喜他，非常鼓勵他（當時的愚辦法）。但是到了第二年冬天，我這乘乘的玉如患肺門結核死了。當時我並不怪學校方面死敎書，也不怪我自己死獎學，只怪孩子患的是死症。直到現在，給貴報一言揭破了，纔知道那是我做家長者的罪過！，學校敎師的罪過！修訂課程標準的專家們的罪過！頒行敎育制度的政府當局的罪過！現在膝下猶虛的我，回憶起來，眞有說不出的悔恨。要不然，土如還在，已是一個二十多歲的有爲的靑年了。可是……，我禁不住老淚縱橫了，寫不下去了。（一個沒有孩子的家長陸麟　，卅五，六，八。）</p>

<h3>橡膠市價步漲　本埠月需千餘噸</h3>
<p>自倫敦傳出美英法荷四國工業生產代表將在英倫商談橡膠價格問題後，滬上橡膠業人士，認爲國外橡膠價格將提漲，握有存貨者多不願出售，致日來本市橡膠市價已較前漲達百分之四十强，但橡膠產量較多之南洋一帶。售價確低於生產製造成本，勢非提價不足以維持，最近新加坡橡膠市價，每磅爲美元二角一分，該地帶產量甚豐，兼之美國人造橡膠事業發達，生產量亦大，故世界橡樛供應可無問題，惟將來價格亦須提高至成本以上，至於我國需要橡膠量，就滬市大小四十餘家橡膠廠而言，每月全部約需用一千餘噸，由新加坡運滬亦甚容易，若運輸通暢，滬價恐難再漲。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天　（十三）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵慎之</p>
<p>我們不能相信三年恢復的結論是學術性的結論，而相信是政治宣傳性的結論。這就是說，這是未經過查後的發言。</p>
<p>我們的談話，很快轉到另一個方向。今天所吃的菜是到長春後從未吃到過的好中國菜。談到瀋陽兵工廠的破壞　時，彭真特別引爲欣慰。瀋陽兵工廠自然是十足的軍事工業，所以問題也就特別明朗，彭真也有了明朗的答覆，他說：</p>
<p>「這破壞的好，否則國民黨還可以多一注本錢來內戰。」</p>
<h3>宴談進行曲</h3>
<p>其實，這種邏輯也可以引用於其他的工業損失，但究竟是一個「爭論的問題」，未被引用。</p>
<p>我們將永遠記得這一次的宴談，這天是四日，這時我們才覺得四國的空氣突然轉換。惠勒因此想到哈爾濱去看看。</p>
<p>這個問題在周保中請我們吃飯時已提到，但他的答覆說：哈爾濱是哈爾濱的事，他不能作主，但可以向東北局提出。三日凱豐來的時候，我們又談起，他極讚成，且說立刻可以掛專車，後來因爲有飛機來接我們不消息，我們就打消了，在四日晚上，到哈爾濱去的計劃。</p>
<p>我們都覺得凱豐是一個受過苦的人，個子瘦小，臉色蒼白，缺牙縫，談話聲音低小，穿一套灰呢中山裝，國上圍巾，戴一頂灰布軍帽，彷彿如重慶的小公務員，爲生活所迫，憔悴萬狀，營養不良，但是眼睛很有神氣。他現在東北局有重要地位，他是委員之一。他和我們第一次見面時，神情緊張，注意集中，和我們的一付「吊兒郎當相」太不調和，他在延安解放日報重慶新華日報工作過，寫他的結論。他所認識的新聞界朋友，也是我們認識的朋友。在問他最近寫文章沒有時，他的答覆是：「已經五年沒有動筆了。」</p>
<p>這天宴談中，他也是主人之一，但是說話最少。惟之向他採訪消息，問他分配土地的情形，撫順附近有備價領取的事是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>他舉了一個例，他說：</p>
<p>「例如梅河口（民主轉軍司令部所在地）附近一里有一個村落，居戶三百戶，這地方有滿拓的耕地，日本人跑了，這些土地就有村民大會來決定，計算之後，每一個成年人可以分行一天地（東北人以一人兩馬的勞力能耕完的地爲一天，約合六畝）這些土地，他們就獲得所權，因此可以轉賣，可以轉佃，但有一個條件必須二五減租。現在東北耕地，有一個問題，許多日本人丟下來的水田，東北人還不會種，他們不要這些水田，其實生產量比旱地要多三倍。」他繼續說：「分配土地並沒有備價領取的規定，礦山地如果目前，還沒有開採，不能使他荒蕪，可以分配，待開採時再收回，備價的事大約是下級執行有問題。」</p>
<p>他接着又說：「東北局　長春，也就是這個緣故，長春是一個重要地方，必須要做得好些，少發生錯誤。」</p>
<p>他們人員有一句口頭語：完全接受你的批評。這句話一說完，對方就只好堵住咀，什麼嚴重的責問都會化得烟消雲散。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，呂正操宣佈現在他們所統率的東北軍已有整整十萬人。以張學詩來說吧。他由關內出關的時候，不過二千餘人</p>
<p>據呂正操告訴我們，他們奉領的東北軍內的幹部，幾乎全是東北人，也幾乎全是流亡在外，而回不得老家去的青年，他們的家，都在日僞的鐵蹄下，他們想回家，想「打回老家去」。他們恨日本鬼子，血債的火燄，在他們心中燎起。所以，一旦踏上了自己遼闊的原野，想報國仇而未遂心願的許多青年，都隨着這「打回老家去」的舊東北軍的旗幟，參加了他們的隊伍，去繳日本鬼子的械。</p>
<p>呂正操正約模四十餘歲，瘦瘦　材，文弱的風度，看去不像一個軍人。他是遼寗海城人，說一口海城話。他現在是東北民主聯軍副總司令兼西滿軍總司令。他是瀋陽講武堂畢業的學生，和趙家　，萬毅，以及這次受傷的政府在長春的城防司令陳家珍，都是很好的同學。他還記得全班人中萬毅考第二，趙家　考第四名的故事。</p>
<p>我們不太知道呂正操這個名字。在西安事後的時候，他是劉多基的部下的一個團長，也許就是他這一團和當時共軍最有關係，也許他就在這個時候，轉變入共產黨。這些問題，我們來不及問他，但是他確很清楚地向我們表示，他自己是一個共產黨黨員，並且是中共中委。</p>
<p>他知道東北老百姓太苦了，不能再有內戰，因此他也反對內戰。他滿口要和平，要民主，他說：「東北要是一天沒有和平，一刻沒有民主，那末，中國也就沒有一刻的安逸。」</p>
<p>所以他說：「在東北的東北軍，絕對朝着反和平，反民主的陣綫上打去。」</p>
<p>我們談話的重心，都集中在國家大事上面，所以空氣反見沉悶下來。我們把談話重心，移到張學良身上去。</p>
<p>呂說：「張漢即是我的老上司，我曾當過他的參謀和副官。他過去的浪漫生活，我們是都很不贊成他的。」不過呂認爲西安事變，張學良完全爲國家與民族，他忘却了他個人。他不存一絲一毫的自私。假使他現在被釋放，假使他還抱着從前的精神，我自然尊敬他，尊敬漢卿的人格。說到此地，他忽然分析陳家珍不繳械的原因。</p>
<p>他說他和陳家珍不獨是同學，並且還是同鄉，都住在海城的一條街上。學校出來以後，都是張學良東北軍的老部下。陳家珍在抗戰期間，在重慶當了一輩子的幕僚，出身東北軍，根本不得意，所以現在當了城防司令，滿想自己幹一下爲自己的前途打一條出路。想不到這次他失敗到底了，他終於成了殘廢。</p>
<p>我們原不知道陳家珍負傷的情形，早想去看他，但是自己根本就沒有自由，所以我們很急切地又把話題移轉到陳家珍身上去。</p>
<p>呂說：「我來此地的第二天，就上醫院扶持看家珍，我們已經快十年不見面了。我第一句安慰家珍的話，是報告他在海城的舊家，還是很安全。他受傷大腿，槍子打中腿骨。受傷後六天，才入醫院，大腿浮腫，像面盆口那麼粗。日本醫生說恐怕殘廢。」</p>
<p>我們沉醉了半天很，講不出什麼話來。心裏確實難過。陳家珍原是一個很老實忠誠的軍人的典型，他這一次的表現，雖然能力比較脆弱，但決不是他一人之力，可以挽回的。我們深切可惜，國家培植一個將材，委實不是一件簡單的事情。結果，殘廢在這種塲合上，真不知從何說起。</p>
<p>呂也覺得有些懊悔，自己同學打同學。</p>
<p>最後，李普曼舉了一個美國南北戰爭的故事。他說：「我們南北戰爭，根本也就是個內戰，同時「西點」的同學，會反臉對打。但是和平終於要來的。」</p>
<p>呂正操向他舉杯說：「爲我們渴望的和平，就乾此一杯吧！」</p>
<h3>會見張學詩</h3>
<p>張學詩在上海的妹妹，曾經囑付李普曼去東北的時候，一定要望望她的四哥。并且在李普曼離滬之前，還託他帶了一封信給張學詩。</p>
<p>當共軍佔領長春不久，李普曼就四處打聽張學詩的行蹤。關裏的人，對於張學詩有否其人，和他神秘的行蹤，都覺得這是一個「謎」。</p>
<p>當我們在廿二日，正是上大和旅館赴周保中的深夜晚宴的時候，李普曼還是繼續打聽張學詩的消息。他從周保中嘴裏知道張學詩在本溪。他高興極了，想立刻到本溪去會他。可是轉念一想自已的自由，還是操在對面的主人的手裏，他沒有辦法，只將懷裏那張小卡片上寫的一封短信，交給周保中，再轉給張學詩。</p>
<p>五四那天，也就是東北局的彭真，呂正操，周保中，凱豐等人請我們吃晚飯的那天。世間看見東北日報上載有「東北大學校長張學詩抵長舉行開學典禮」的消息，立刻告訴李曾曼。他高興極了，他說：「我真想看看這少帥的兄弟。」</p>
<p>於是晚飯後，呂正操，李普曼，世洵三人，圍坐休息室內的小方桌上，我們首先一個問題就是：「聽說張學詩已經來了」？</p>
<p>不錯的，他今晚本打算參加歡迎你們記者先生的這個會，因爲東北大學的事情，實在太忙，所以沒有來。呂這樣回答我們。</p>
<p>李普曼說明了急於要會見張學詩的渴念，呂正操答應明天找他和我們談話。</p>
<p>五五的早晨，呂正操派副官送來了一輛車子，並且要周保中的秘書劉柯會同我們一齊去。劉說張學詩在呂正操家裏等我們。</p>
<p>這是一個初雨未賽的早晨，在東北的沙漠太原路上，有細細春雨的滋潤，委實是一件非常難過的事情。我們枯　了這許多日子，春見雨自然十分歡喜，決沒有江南人那般煩厭春雨的心情。</p>
<p>我們大家等候在會客室裏。不到三分鍾，呂正操把張學詩引下樓來。張學詩站中我們中間，穿燙得很挺的軍服，足登黃色馬靴。瘦瘦的身材，顯得十分俊秀。北大南相，頗有些像張學良年輕的模樣，他不像一般共軍軍人那般的衣冠隨便。</p>
<p>他告訴我們他現在是三十二歲，西安事變的時候，他方在南京中央軍校十期。他和幾個美國同業談話，能自己隨便運用外語，而且說得有相當的好。我們奇怪他說英語的技能。他說他是北平匯文中學的畢業生。</p>
<p>七七事變，他參加了八路軍，在華北，華中和鬼子幹了七八年。他說：「我要　此國恥與家仇。」他也承認自己去年九月回東北的時候，手下不過二千多人。他告訴我們他的幹有二分之一以上是舊東北軍的。</p>
<p>當我們提到張學良的時候，他首先便問：「你們諸位先生都是從關裏來的，但不知我大哥現在還好嗎？我已是九年沒有看見他了。」說時，面部的表情，十分關切。</p>
<p>李普曼答道：「我去年曾想去看他，可是後來因爲中國政府不允我去。但是我間接聽來，他鬧革命在胖得多了，並且還飽讀了不少書。」張學詩沒有說什麼話，頭靠在沙發背上，兩眼直瞅住天花板。」</p>
<p>隔了半響，他問：「聽說我大哥有被釋放的消息？」</p>
<p>我們告訴他有時在報上看到這種消息，真確與否，不得而知。於是他說：</p>
<p>「我大哥在西安事變以後，宋子文保證他去南京走一次。立刻讓他回去。當時我曾去看大哥，他向我表示西安事變他全是爲國家民族，絕沒有爲自己。所以現在他是應該出來的。」</p>
<p>我們就問他：「假使他現在被釋放，你是否還是隨他取同一的政見？」</p>
<p>「我大哥假使仍舊不變，仍舊是西安事變的作風，仍舊向民主道路去走，我自然受戴他。不過，我深切了解他的爲人，他是不會變的。」</p>
<p>此後，他說他的部隊都在本溪附近，他最近是從本溪回長春的。他下面有二萬五千人。他還告訴我們，他已經結了婚，並且有兩個孩子。</p>
<p>當我們快走的時候，李普曼問他有什麼信要帶給他妹妹。他思索了一會，含笑說道：</p>
<p>「問她的好吧。請你告訴她，我最關懷的還是我大哥。」</p>
<p>張學詩是一個年輕的軍人。共方說他是民選的遼寧省主席，同時又是東北大學校長，但是他始終沒有承認自己是共黨黨員，他拒絕了發表這個問題的意見。他說在一九三八年曾經到延安一次，住了幾個月。以後，即和呂正操在一起，在華北前線。（待續）</p>

<p>安徽第一號大漢奸巢縣人李樂新李樂齊兩兄弟，蕪湖人汪子東汪善誠兄弟，在昔或係流氓，或係不正當商人，固毫無國家民族觀念者。蕪湖淪陷後，彼輩卽勾結日敵，統制物資，携带日軍，分赴各縣搜集軍糧，開設銀行，擾亂金融，並曾收集如山之木料，嗣山洪沖毀蕪湖利涉橋，死傷船戶行人百餘人，無人敢於提出質問。彼輩出入均有日軍護架，李等所置之倉庫房屋，自巢縣直至蕪湖，南京，蘇州，南通，上海，氣勢喧赫，萬人側目。收復以後，除注善誠一人被捕外，餘均神通廣大，潛歷逃避，抄沒封閉之財產，僅佔極少數。李等已漸由其家屬出面，將一部份房屋，租於强有力者，負責方面，似皆無暇過問。</p>
<p>汪逆善誠被捕，判處死刑後，人心痛快。自被判死刑後，除其子汪用　偕店夥等赴京請求覆判外，其老母妻女等，恐怖之餘，竟於日昨　吞鴨片，實行集體自殺，幸發覺尚早，多數獲救，僅其第三女因服毒過多，尚在危險期中。漢奸全家集體自殺者，在懲奸工作展開以來，尚屬創聞。特記之以　本報讀者。</p>

<h3>台灣黑市</h3>
<p>— 五月廿八日航訊　晚蘋</p>
<p>台灣是我們世外桃源，東方的瑞士。我們的政府當局，尤其是台灣的行政長官，假使大家好好地幹，那兒有現成的局面，事半功倍，當易見效。</p>
<p>一台幣現狀</p>
<p>台灣可以不適用法幣？這是國內一般人最不能了解的。</p>
<p>在亂懵糟的我國，一時要使政治全部上軌道，那是絕對不可能的。台灣的一切措施，最顯明的，是幣值很穩定，帶值能穩定，台民的生活也安定了，比較上海奸商的興風作浪，使得市民時常提心吊膽的看着物價「瘋狂」地暴漲，這兒是好得多。台幣與法幣的比值，規定是一作三十。假使是一作一，聰明的上海商人，早已整船地把這兒所有的物資搬空了。你想台民還能生活嗎？如今商人是無利可圖了。「到台灣去」，他們是不再想起了。陳儀看透上海商人的可怕，技倆的變化百出，爲愛護台民起見，不得不首先採取關門政策，實行抬高台幣價值的措施，以抵制商人的取巧，獲得暴利，陷台民於水深火熱之中。商人因發不到財，大家怨嗟，使散佈流言，中傷陳氏。因爲戰後物價的反動，是不能避免的，不過反動的限度，影響民生太大了，吝地因地制宜，那是必然的需要。眼前台幣官價是一作三十，黑市都衹有廿二元左右。最近，關金券與台幣的兌換率，由八折升到九三折，就是台幣的黑市價值跌到法幣二二左右，反轉來說：法幣已外值三十分之八，並不像上海物價的上漲，使法幣總是貶值下去，試問：在國內有黑市比官價低的情形嗎？這是一個奇蹟，也就是台灣經濟政策的最大成功。</p>
<p>小偷猖獗</p>
<p>現在到台灣去的人，最痛恨的是小偷太多，便是防不勝防。這又是一般人不滿行政當局的一點。當局也認爲非常抱憾，正在研究對策。假使想起往日的台灣，何以能做到「夜不閉戶」？它的原因，是（一）把當地的宵小，誘導他們爲非作歹，向外發展，到我國各地去做浪人。（二）把宵小驅逐集中在孤島，不能立足於台灣。（三）捉到了小偷，在馬路上足踢，（最鄙視那被踢者的處罰）並判處徒刑。以後發生了竊案，第一個便捉先犯案的小偷再度偵訊，所以做小偷就終身受累。因此，誰也不敢做小偷。及（四）警察都是便衣的，很能負責在路上巡邏，看看路上無警察，一有事，就來了警察。小偷偷了東西，往往就被抓住。任何人發現了小偷，也奮勇檢舉。我們覺得第四點最扼要，對於國內的警務，很可以借鏡。對於人民的互助精神，也應該養成。如今大批浪人被遣送回台灣了。大批孤島上的被逐者，在日人去後，也沒人監視而溜回了。</p>
<p>旱象可畏</p>
<p>在市容方面，台灣是很「憔悴」的。跟其他各地一樣，差不多都犯了這貧血症。物資的缺乏，購買力的低落，都是一時不能恢復繁榮的因素。但台灣有的是物產和資源，尤其是食米，一年可三熟。眼前米貴而有些恐慌。台南高雄等處，數月不雨，有旱災之象。記者五朋初來台北，天天晴熱小雨，河水也淺得很，真替台人及當局躭心。萬一是旱荒了，台人將怎樣受苦，當局將更難於就會。可喜的，這幾天天天下着雨，天公能做美，新生的台灣，兩個月後，不但糧食恐慌可以解除，當局亦能專心於整理工作吧。</p>
<h3>流亡羣的呼聲（二）</h3>
<p>編者先生：我整日苦痛了的心，使我再難容忍的發出了熱血的怒吼，其實也許只不過是生命邊緣上的呻吟。我寫這封信的意義，衹希望一般紙醉金迷的大人先生們，及一般把幸福建築在人家痛苦上的萬惡奸　們，還能片刻的想到「四强之一」「堂堂華夏」的一角是生活着如何的一羣人們，並且希望轉政書者看現在蘇北人民是怎樣的在　扎着。</p>
<p>與在先以我個人來說起。我是蘇北靖江人氏，XX國立大學的一年級生。普通看來，以蘇北的情形，我尚能够求學，也足自滿了。然而勝利後的流浪者，是如何值得痛心啊！</p>
<p>家鄉破產了，連芽　讀書的志願皆不能　。因爲蘇北是另外的一個環境了！即使閉門讀書，也不難丟掉你的生命。無奈何，衹好流浪，而今大學生是大學生了，然而就以膳食而言，今日遺不知明日的飯費在那裏，借貸無門，受盡白眼。回去罷？正趕上「殺三資」的高潮。停學吧？除非睡馬路去。我不知道爲什麼政府不　痛快使的收回冀北。若說遵行什麼假信假義的協商談判，那麼爲什麼四平街又打得那麼厲害呢？難道東北不是屬於中國，難道在東北作戰的不是共黨與國軍？那末爲什麼還不統一軍政，稅後和蹩制？勝利九月來，你收捐，他公糧，鄉下的錢不可街上用，街上的錢不可鄉下用，東邊衝突，西邊殺人再等大人先生停戰下來，老百姓早死光了！尤其可氣的，鬧着救濟，救濟！我流浪到今天，根本就沒有看見救濟了什麼東西給蘇北青年，在真真沒有辦法的時候，也或許只好回家鄉去從事革命，雖然更害了一部份同胞，也許至少在私人不會餓死異地罷。</p>
<p>再說到我們學校裏的幾個蘇北同鄉，他們的父母兄妹不是寄居在揚州，就是鎮江。在過去，他們差洶皆有一個美麗名詞，「耕　傳家」。在碧綠的原野上，在小溪環繞的鄉村中，度着悠閒天倫的生活。可是現在所謂「解放」的天地裏，他們是被認爲一般食人的資產階級，給革命者所驅逐出境了。其實中國農村資產階級，只有天知道，然而，在正義上講，一般佃戶的生活，確是够苦了。平均地構，在中國實在是非要實行不可而現在「解放」了，又怎樣呢？只有給一般佃戶更苦的磨難，層層的公糧，雜捐除外，勝利後仍舊保留着的「參軍運動」，又斷送了多少可憐的生命。「誰無父母？誰無妻子？」只不過利用着一種低能人物思想簡單者，給他們爲爭取權貴能賭本，說來真是可憐之極！而結果呢，名爲革命，其實送了地主的命，也更厲害的　送了許多愚　而忠純的農夫之命！現在我也不用多說蘇北的情形了。蘇北的情形，我也敢不過期評斷，就以我放　假回去十餘日的農村生活而言，我回去的時候，因爲却　國共協商完成，所以鄉間到也平安，那時我親看見很多的農民家裏在　着茵草爲飽，（茵草就是上海人所謂金花菜），他們沒有一些怨恨，他們沒有一些苦痛，唯有一種我國民族性的堅忍。他們沒有遺恨到任何人，他們如一羣幼弱無主的羔羊，又像一匹生活鞭策老了的耕牛，他們不知道爲了個人的生存，他們終日從事着大眾的生產。偉大的行政官吏，試問你們又怎能對得起這般馴良可憐的國民呢？他們是無知，也無舌，他們在自己暗暗的吞着辛酸的淚，他們在自己飲着自己的血！可是他們的血早要給人們吸吮盡了！</p>
<p>編輯先生，我已經化去我大半夜的時候，來寫這封信了。窗外是那般的墨黑，好像光明是被什麼　若食了去的，好在我今夜是做不成功課了，但是，我好像還有許多說不盡的話，哽咽在喉間，再也吐不出來。就此一點東西，先生苦能擺在讀者　　給一般大人先生們知道知道，我就感激不盡了。復旦大學一個落拓的蘇北青年上。</p>

<h3>劉獅魚展</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>讀萬卷書，行萬里路，多樣多彩的生活，對於一個文人，一個藝術家，實在是必不可少的條件。</p>
<p>劉獅，一位中國青年畫家，以抗戰時代作分野，在他的感情上，尤其是藝術深度上，可說一大飛躍。侭管他在抗戰八年中，到現在爲止，繪畫工作方面還沒有拿出反映或代表這偉大時代的作品出來，然而假定他滯留在淪陷區裏，即使不爲敵僞作供奉，他能認識這八年時代意義，他能呼吸到祖國千千萬萬人民抗戰的可歌可泣的氣氛嗎？</p>
<p>這八年來，他的日了完全在戰地度過去了，他以政工人員的身份奔馳各戰塲，如果說理解戰爭，理解士兵生活，理解農村，他不會少於任何人。</p>
<p>從七日起，十三日止，他在寗波同鄉會舉行一個星期的展覽會，據說作品全部是魚。中國畫家中，以魚著稱的，有汪亞鹿先生，劉獅自然是後起，但他爲什麼專畫魚呢？也許荘子的逍遙篇是我們追究這問題的結果罷。</p>
<p>廿三年春在東京神田區的三省堂，曾看過劉獅的展覽會，那時他的作品全部是油畫，屈指算來，已十有二年，我想，他此次的展出，一定會令我驚異的罷。</p>
<h3>保衛團存在與否</h3>
<p>— 沈振聲</p>
<p>記得前次市政會義席上，市參議員某君，提出關於保衛團的質問。意思是「本市軍警林立，已够維持治安，爲何再要傷財糜費，養這批擾民的保衛團」云云。最近又有保衛團改編爲保安警察的消息，並聞保衛團除常住團員外，有加以解散的謠言。敝人因爲保衛團之組織，與地方治安，有極密切的關係，不得不本人民之立塲，來參商保衛團之組織是否有存在的價值。</p>
<p>上海市市區交通便利，軍警林立，治安網的佈置已是相當嚴密。偶有擾亂事件，軍警即能迅到出事地點，維持秩序。市參議員某君便根據市區情形，對另有保衛團之組織，表示不滿，不無相當理由。但本市郊區，與市區情形就不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>本市郊區，鄉土廣袤，人口散漫。於是軍警的駐紥，不得不限於若干較大的市鎮。然而盜匪的淵蔽，以及盜匪的案件，每在窮鄉僻壤的地方。所以郊區軍警的維持治安，實有顧此失彼之苦。</p>
<p>本市郊區的秩序，白天非常安靜，軍警人員簡直毫無工作。一到夜深人靜的時候，盜匪便會突然發作。因爲郊區交通不便等種種關係，軍警的維持治安，實感鞭長莫及。</p>
<p>以上所述，皆顯見的事實。故本市郊區，組織保衛團，以　起協助維持治安的責任，其理由極夥，就鄙人所知可再列舉數端</p>
<p>郊區市鎮鄉村，參差不齊。市鎮的外圍，即是鄉村。如果鄉村治安有把握，市鎮可高枕無憂。所以若在鄉村地方組織了保衛團，對於全部地方消安，必有極大的幫助。此侯衛團有必要的理由一。</p>
<p>處實行地方自治的今日，當地公民應該負起責任，盡當地一切自治的義務，保衛團可以說也是自治工作的一種。此保衛團有必要的理由二。</p>
<p>萬一遇到國際軍事侵略，欲　國家達到能够抵禦外侮的目的，不能不注意國民的軍事敎育。保衛團亦是軍事敎育的一種。此保衛團有必要的理由三。</p>
<p>保衛團團員大多是當地熱心青年，關懷桑梓，寗願拋棄若干寶貴光陰，從事服務地方。因爲團員素具鄉土觀念，遇有盜匪事件，往往奮不顧身，能够克盡　責。此保衛團有必要的理由四。</p>
<p>基於以上四項理由，郊區保衛團之地位，較軍警的地位，實重要多多。自保衛團成立以來盜匪已漸絕跡，不可謂非保衛團的功勞。倘保衛團之制度仍有缺點，自宜漸次改善。</p>
<h3>害阿拉　來死哭死</h3>
<p>— 蔣中一</p>
<p>讀了「的平」先生的「看你窮」，不禁由跑狗聯想到了圓力球塲和跑馬　。</p>
<p>圓力球塲的西文名字是HAI-A-LAI，照常　，便是「害阿拉」！現在這種賭博雖已禁止，然而在原址上設立起一個「原子舞　」，似乎也不高明！</p>
<p>至於跑馬　的西文名是RACE　COURSE譯音當爲「來死－哭死」！這裏，我們謹希望當局將跑馬應改建公園的計劃早日實現，使一個「催淚」的塲所廢成一個供給市民以新鮮空氣的樂園！</p>
<h3>廣告的藝術</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>打開報紙，滿眼是廣告；馬路的墻壁上，滿眼是廣告；銀幕上，也有的是廣告；甚至你府上，有時也有綠衣使者送上幾封廣告信來。</p>
<p>廣告的藝術，一句話，引人入勝，打動你的心而已。</p>
<p>了廣告的媒介，當然可以優勝劣敗，使優良的貨品推廣，落伍的貨品消減。便是，也因爲太注意於廣告的宣傳，有時會忽略了本質的改善，廣告成了言過其實。廣告和欺騙，有如正確的報導和歪曲的宣傳，界綫是難分的。明眼人自然明白。</p>
<p>新貨品出世了，唯恐人家不知道，拚命登廣告。大減價了，又是唯恐人家不知道，拚命登廣告。廣告的種類愈過愈　多，勾心鬥角亦愈樂。有時候戴上了一篇亦荘亦嚴的宣言，好像道貌岸然不可侵犯的樣子；有時却戴上一篇詼諧的笑話，吸引你的好奇心。有時候他用低價來吸引你，譬如說：「美國西裝五千元」。其實等到你去時，所謂五千元的只是丟在屋角的破碎的髒衣。有時候却用高貴貨質來吸引你，譬如說：「真正美國貨DDT」之類。其實又有誰知道葫蘆裏賣什麼藥呢？</p>
<p>假使廣告上全部是虛構的謊言，那這個廣告的設計者一定是個最笨拙的傢伙。廣告要不失真實，但是却又要引吸人家，那才是高明手法。記得從前有一種牙膏，它的廣告是「有蘇蘇聲」。人家一試，的確不錯，不過這牙膏好不好，值得不值得，却要用者自己去填答案要。這才是好辦法。</p>
<p>自拉自唱的鳴謝，吹噓，介紹，除了騙騙鄉下的人以外，怕一點也不會有什麼功效的吧！這種自作聰明的掩眼法，能瞞得過誰呢？</p>
<p>你要說廣告一點功用都沒有麼，那這句話當然誰也不相信。但是說廣告是絕對可恃，那倒也不見得。主重的，還是在本質的好壞；廣告上的出奇制勝，可以圖盡功，絕不能爲你說達計的。</p>
<h3>換心</h3>
<p>— 佐治</p>
<p>所謂「人心不古」，不一定是頑固派的看法，這年頭兒，人們的「心」的確離開「古道」愈遠了。儘管滿口「仁義道德」，背地裏却幹着「男盜女娼」的勾當。掛着的雖是「羊頭」，出賣的却「狗肉」。聽說人們在接收「公物」之外，還接收了金條，洋房和汽車。來時兩手空空，去時滿載而歸。這些人十足暴露了他們的「黑心」和「狠心」。</p>
<p>最近蘇聯科學家辛尼漢博士試騐「換心術」，據說已經獲得初步成功。他把一只蛙的害病的心臟取去，把一顆健全的心臟移接上去，那蛙照舊活着，跟先前沒有兩樣。辛氏又用貓，狗和兔子做試騐，結果也很美滿。因此他相當把人類的害病的心臟掉換一顆健全的心臟，不是不可能的事情。此事獲得成功以後，對於人類奪命一大威脅的「心臟病」便不足爲慮了。這樣，一大部分的人類的確「得救」了。</p>
<p>可是，我倒覺得世界上的這輩狼心狗肺，巧取豪奪的狐羣狗黨，他們的「黑心」和「狠心」先得「更換」一下。我以爲；惟有這樣，人類將真正「得救」了。</p>
<h3>不要亂用維他命——過猶不及</h3>
<p>— 楊永彰</p>
<p>近年國人對於維他命的知識漸漸豐富起來，特別是那些居住在大都市裏面的富人們，更重視維他命，以爲一切的健康和幸福，似乎都埋藏在維他命之中。聰明的商人畢竟是生財有道，他們旣懂經濟學的原理，又能迎合許多人錯誤的心理，於是維他命的藥片，針劑都應時而生。人們好　都是閉着眼睛在那裏亂用維他命，他們根本不明白維他命的性質和效用（當然指最簡單的），只知一味亂吃藥片，亂打補針。</p>
<p>我並不否認維他命的價值，就拿維他命A來說，牠確能助長發育，增加營養，預防眼乾燥症，夜盲症以及其他傳染病。缺少維他命A，就能發生上述種種疾病，小兒又因抵抗力減低而易患疹子，猩紅熱等病。人體細胞每因維他命不足而起萎縮坯死，許多神經變性症亦與維他命A有關</p>
<p>人體一日所須維他命A量約爲4.000-8000國際單位，可是我們無須另行攝取純粹的維他命，（沒有病時）因爲在肉類，魚類，蔬菜中已經獲得充分的份量。身體中的肝臟固能大量確藏維他命A，可是也有一定的限制，過多的維他命在體內是無法保存的，由消化器官吸收後，經過血液循環，總必有腎臟隨尿排同體外，這封身體毫無利益。</p>
<p>維他命A如此，其他如維他命A，B，C，D，E，F，I…乙等都是如此，我們絕對不能亂用維他命而忽略了其他的攝身，許多人吞了維他命丸，打了維他命針，就不好好當心自己的身體，以爲維他命能「袪除萬病」，「延年益壽」，這反受了維他命的害呢。</p>
<p>醫學的進步已經證實了「維他命過多病」（Hypervitaminosis）與缺乏症一樣有害身體，這與其他藥物的中毒一樣可怕，例如維他命D，誰都知道缺乏時會有軟骨病，但是多量服用時，則竟能發生關節强直症，血管硬外及腎臟結石等，這反害了性命。</p>
<p>我希望每個人能合理應用維他命，不要「不及」也不宜「太過」，而且絕對不能亂用維他命，許多廣告往往與醫學上實際的效用離得太遠，因爲製藥商人都半爲了許多人的錯誤心理而誇大虛傳，有些製品的「質」和「量」都不合標準，這實在有損於維他命的聲譽和信仰。</p>
<p>最後，請再讀幾遍題目，否則恐怕我再要寫一篇「不要怕用維他命」了。</p>
<h3>小呼籲</h3>
<p>— 怡英</p>
<p>在衙堂口的牆根上，常常會發現「禁止小便，如逾送捕」等語。可是要小便的人，却偏偏找這種地方去小便；這無　地已造成了「此處無銀三百兩」的後果。</p>
<p>記得從前被稱爲租界的時候，各個捕房，每日例須派出幾輛所謂「香港車」，巡視各馬路逢到「隨處小便」的仁兄，那諔不客氣，請你去嘗念四小時的鐵窗風味，或則處以一隻洋　金。可是現在租界被收回了，市政也由我們自己來整飭了，然而「隨地小便」的事情，却從來沒有被衛生當局注意過。</p>
<p>報載：　性霍亂在本市已迭有發現，一班公立醫院的醫生和護士們，都在各馬路要道口，强迫行人注射防疫針；我以爲這好像是治標辦法，唯一澈底的治本之計，端頗如何不使霍亂菌的產生？因而使我聯想到第一項要做的工作，就是立刻「禁止隨地小便」！</p>

<h3>馮玉祥新詩：　「對不住水」</h3>
<p>行將出國考察水利之馮玉祥將軍，於離前夕，在嘉陵江頭寫「新詩」一首，題爲「對不住水」，原文如次：「滾滾長江水，日夜向東流，爲用本無窮，我們用不週。浮力可行船，江中無船走，一日七百里，只見一條舟。橫力可灌溉，田中水無有，靠天來吃飯，年年鬧歉收。衡力可發電，大閘沒有修，沿江少人烟，生產皆落後，三力都不用，對水毋知着？如今新世界，趕上須迎　」。</p>

<h3>倒老爺氣燄　每一便桶萬元以上</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>

<h3>上海話劇總評之一</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>自到上海以後，一共看了快有十次話劇。在這些演出中，成績各各不同，有些是導演的成功超過了演員，有些則是演員演的技超過了導演，更有的是劇本益過一切，使導演和演員失去英所有的光輝。我想把這十次的話劇作一個總評。</p>
<p>一·「秋海棠」</p>
<p>這戲我只有看過兩次。第一次是慕石揮的名去看的，因爲只是去欣賞一個演員的演技，所以，使我非常滿意地在看完劇後走出了劇塲。當我第二次再去看的時候，却使我非當地驚奇。因爲我發覺「秋海棠」的導演　有嚴肅地担負起責任來；也許是導演者採取放任制也未可知。因而演員捕捉角色的形象，和演技的發展頗不一致。其中最大的對比，就是演季兆雄的丁山和演秋海棠的石揮。他們的演技所走的路線不是同一的，而是相反的。丁山所處理的季兆雄完全是走的外形，使他自己的動作和表情，姿態都誇大，甚至于特別强調。倒如布第二幕第二塲，他指着通里面的門對羅湘綺說：「秋海棠在這屋里。」他說話時擺了一個弓勢，手指着門，眼睛望著右邊的羅湘綺，有半分鐘之久。這一個舞台　面，很顯得不現實！像這一類不自然的「擺姿勢」的塲面有好幾</p>
<p>石揮演的秋海棠在四五慕中，最叫人感得眞實。因他的確是忠實地創造了一個性格。他在情緒轉移和一念之間的思想轉變，都能用微渺的停頓傳達給觀衆。他沒有特致的動作和姿態，但他有豐富的內心的情感。因爲他自己知道只有內心的情感才能深深地轟動觀衆的心絃。同時，他能一絲不苟且的利用自已本身的條件創造出一個完美的形象，而用這形象—微駝的身子，慢慢的走動，含蓄了很多苦痛的低而響亮和沉重的聲音，敲動每一個觀衆對他年輕時的回憶。他這種處理方式完全是由內心做出發點的。所以能演來那麽生動！那麽真實！這可以說是他本人的修養好，觀察人生的深刻，因此能够始終控制着自己的情緒，使一個眞實的人物性格再現在舞台上。</p>
<p>導演沒有使這劇演員的演技統一。因此，也沒有使這劇的演出完整。頗爲可惜！</p>
<p>二·「埋頭苦幹」</p>
<p>這劇中演員的演技就整齊得多了。他們處理角色的出發點完全是一樣的，所有的亦是演員本身演技的高低了。在這劇中演技最無　點的當　演社啓　的張伐。他並沒有什麽特別使觀衆喜歡的動作和姿態在有隙的地方露一手，只是很平淡的一直演到完，但他却能使一個完美的性格露流出來。這些，是一個低能的演員所無法理解的。導演者在這個戲中所負的責任，也不能說少，但他並沒有使這個達到最高的目的。只是使這劇在舞台上活動而已。所以，這劇的演出頗覺平淡。</p>
<p>尤其是這劇的主題反給愛情的塲面所掩　，有喧賓奪主的感覺。</p>
<p>三·「金小玉」</p>
<p>它的主題是暴露舊軍閥和　官僚的荒淫，貪污和殘酷。導演者使這劇在舞台上很完整的演出了</p>
<p>演員中以丹尼和石揮的演技最完美，丹尼演的是紅女伶金小玉。她使金小玉的性格更明顯，使金小玉對范永立眞誠的愛情更流露無遺。當最後一幕王士倚威逼她，幾次强暴地撫摸她頭髮的時候，她在表面是順從的，在內心却包藏着强烈的反抗。最後范永立槍斃後被抬進來，她以爲他是嚇暈了，在倒了酒給他喝時，才發現他是眞的死了！這兩塲里的情緒，丹尼都能使它很明顯的表現出來；使前者的內藏憤怒外表順從，同時還想乘隙動手刺死對方。和後者的已殺死王士倚後的心慌，見范永立被抬進時的喜狀，並想赶快逃出。一到發現對方已死，就萬念俱灰，殺身殉情；這些情緒的表現，全無遺留的介紹給觀衆了。這樣有修養的女演員，在上海的舞台上至今還沒有發現第二個呐！但是，外彩和嗓子却不能帶助她到完美的境地，覺得很可惜！</p>
<p>石揮在這劇中演舊軍閥王士倚，能把對上的卑躬屈膝，和對下的吆喝命令，對革命志士的威脅利誘，都表現出來。演范永立的崔超明也能把一個捨身取義的性格刻劃出來。</p>
<p>這劇演員的分配，處理的角色，演技的出發點，都很整齊。導演者對該劇的處理也很得當。例如七太太在第二幕進來，直至她進去喝酒的一塲，導演者很明顯的讓她坐在圓桌旁的櫈上。在她右邊是三位女太太，在她左邊是那輩大人們，使全塲都注意她一人。同時舞台面也根有層次，很美觀。</p>
<p>苦幹劇團的三次演出，當以「金小玉」的藝術水準最高！無論是從劇本，導演，演員和設計佈景上的那一部份去着眼，都能超過前兩次演出的藝術水準！同時也比前兩次的演出，完整和美好。因爲戲劇藝術是綜合藝術，最可貴的還是演出上的完整，各部門的合作和演技的統一，這些都該由導演者負責與否來決定。因爲導演者在演員的走動上是負責指導。在演員的演技上是面鏡子，該把照出的結果吿訴演員，使演員知道自己的毛病在那兒，然後着手修改，使他們演技的出發點相同。假使演員們都能抱着「人生是短促的，藝術才是永生的」態度，很嚴肅的來完成一件藝術品，一點不加小噱頭，那麽，這演出就一定會完整，！也一定會成功！</p>
<h3>為韓蘭根拍戲事答客問</h3>
<p>— 吳永剛</p>
<p>涇淸分流。淸濁自分，　猶異器，香臭有別，忠者褒，奸者貶此維繫民族正氣之天經地義，永剛雖不敏，亦頗明此理，所以在報筆作「忠義之家』劇本時，對於八年來留居孤島上居民中之忠者奸者，頗有所腐敗，而對於劇中之以勾結敵僞，國積居奇起家，勝利後靦　自詡爲地下工作者之漢奸，尤其痛加撻伐，務使觀衆獲得一明顯之印象，知忠奸必分，忠者當法，奸者當憎，此爲執筆時之初衷，永剛素非好蹺舌作丑表功者，近因以曾以韓蘭根飾劇中在淪陷期中以虎作倀，硬派「新申報」之報販事，報章交責，朋齊相問，永剛於感愧之餘，當將富時之動機與經過一一奉吿於後</p>
<p>上海淪陷期中，報販强派，「新申報」等偽殺事，想上海居民都曾親身遭受，永剛返滬後，家人亦曾道及，故即採入劇情中，述有一愛國居民因拒看僞報，而遭該報販邀一臂　敵報導部臂章之日本浪人痛毆幾死，當時衆居民敢怒而不敢抗，迨敵人宣佈投降時，，該報販爲居民所執，或有以該逆應待政府懲處，衆人以政府或無暇顧及此類小醜，遂以牙還牙，以眼還眼而痛懲之，永剛因韓蘭根之小丑面自，頗類此種人物，遂以其飾演此角。</p>
<p>邀韓蘭根飾演此角事，經爲永剛個人主張，並未接受任何人之命令或指使，所以此事應由永剛個人負責。</p>
<p>若云當初之動機擬以韓蘭根之低級噱頭以迎合觀衆之低級趣味，則永剛不自菲薄，敢云「忠義之家」自有其本身之價値，尙不致以低級趣味求增加該片之營業價値，</p>
<p>若云永剛以與韓　根之私交關係，存心爲之作袒護，圖超脫，試問劇中該角爲何等樣人物，對於觀衆將產生何等樣印象，再者即使永剛有此存心，試問社會羣衆檢舉裁制之權利是否因之而喪失，永剛雖愚昧，亦不致笨拙如此，而甘冒此大不韙也，若論私交，永剛又何偏獨徇私，厚愛於韓蘭根一人，而自陷於不忠不義。</p>
<p>該片開拍前，永剛曾爲築思廣益計，擬於攝製完竣後，遍邀上海新聞界文化界諸先進，試映該片在公映前能無不妥之處，呈於觀衆之前，今當復申前議，想諸位先進屆時當不吝珠玉，如共認爲該段劇情對於觀衆有不良影響，則永剛富不惜一剪而付之丙丁。</p>
<p>此事永剛當可自承爲事前失之欠審愼，如有存心徇私之實，則請付檢舉，永剛甘願坐附逆之罪，知我罪我，當有公論。</p>
<p>報章交責，朋儕相問，無非爲愛護貧乏之國產電影，以故在感愧之餘，謹致感謝之忱。</p>
<p>影片批評</p>
<h3>當差的妹妹</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>鏡頭的圓滑完全是導演的經騐豐富吃魚的穿插不妨對編劇有修改商</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍是好萊塢戰前童星蛻變中的驕子，她不但仍然保持着原有的頭牌地位，而且她每年所攝的片子又比一般的明星爲多，年輕，漂亮和能唱歌占着很大的關係，與秀蘭鄧波兄恰成反比。</p>
<p>「當差的妹妹」是一部她成功的片子，她的演戲進步不少，大部份都是導演的功勞。聽說這部片十成功以後，再接再厲的還有一部她和佛蘭支通的片子「因爲你」已經攝就，它是一部影色的，狄安娜初攝影色片，是賣雙重的噱頭。</p>
<p>我們現在談談這部片子的　劇。</p>
<p>「當差的妹妹」是變愛喜劇，含着一股「階級祇是在通常狀態之下可以存在」的題意，常男主角法關支在「二爺茶會」中不准入內的時候，他祇能急得冒充女佣的表弟，那把這個題意講述得何等淸楚，同時在這一塲中我們也感覺到，一個人在平時雖屬「二爺」身份，但在另一角中，他們却都是「大爺」身份，大禮服，照樣有人服侍，階級的懸殊祇能在職業辦公時分別，等到一下班的娛樂時間應該一律平等。題意在這種寫法是最難，而最可貴，因爲它並沒有喊口號，也沒有說敎，更沒有敎訓觀衆；它却是在嘻嘻哈哈之中包含着深長的意味，讓觀衆看完戲之後回想起來方始知道有這個題意的存在。</p>
<p>故事的構成是一連串的誤會，一開塲就是狄安娜在車上誤以銷貨員爲大作曲家法蘭支，接着是她誤她會哥哥柏德是百萬大富翁，一審給她錢就是一千元，（解說也解說得很好，柏德說他一千元錢乃是賭跑馬贏來的）後來又有法蘭支誤會她是新使女，泡泡夫誤乘一層樓電梯而遇見了狄安娜狄安娜高歌給法蘭支誤會是無綫電播音，結果再加上一個狄安娜與法蘭支的戀愛上的誤會復結束全劇。</p>
<p>這幾個誤會都安插得很好，都有挑動戲的進展的能力，當像看完戲以後，也以這幾個誤會塲面給你的回味最易於記起，好你這戲的整個放事便繫於這根串連「誤會」的錢上。本來「誤會」在戲劇的構成因素上也是一個很好的方法，光其在喜劇上，略越軌於羅輯一步也沒有什麽大關係。</p>
<p>祇是最後柏德於法蘭支之前造成的戀愛誤會與前面幾個比較之下，好像所用的分量太重，致與全劇不大吻合，影響柏德的個性不少，如要讓故事這樣的進展下去，在這段誤會之前好像還短少一個過程。</p>
<p>人物方面的描寫以柏德爲最失敗，上半段與下半段好像判若兩人，依他個性的轉變方程，似乎還缺少一點「小人感」，看完這一部片子以後好像感覺到柏德奧勃林還沒有我們的石揮好。</p>
<p>對於男女兩主角是成功的，例如兩八初見的一塲，狄安娜伏在鋼琴底下正在使用電拖帶，吱吱的聲音刺着了法蘭支的耳朶，他是一個音樂家，對於聲音的感觸特別靈敏，這是描寫的細膩處。</p>
<p>還有那泡泡夫等追求狄安娜五個人，編導對於「五」字也費過一番功夫，在第一次街頭上五個人好像與四個人六個人沒有什麽兩樣，第二次在廚房中也是如此，好像覺得五個人是最多了，如果再按一下電鈴簡直是討厭，然在最後狄安娜將唱歌時的泡泡夫報吿，五人一排輾轉傳語則完全顯出五個人是不多不少，比四個人精彩，比六個人經濟，所以對這個「五」，我表示十分的贊成。</p>
<p>整個劇本的編製，除柏德的個性欠明已如前述外，尙有一點似乎有商討之價値；</p>
<p>戲中安插一女佣，最愛吃魚，凡愛吃魚的都是她的好朋友妙極，妙極，又更妙在她主人法蘭支不吃魚，這是一個很好，很新頴的戲劇資料，然在最後法蘭支在「二爺總會」的一塲沒把這一點戲的存料充份利用，實在是一件很可惜的事情。</p>
<p>戲中原來的程序是如此</p>
<p>（一）法蘭支相繼被柏德及劇團主人拒絕參加茶會，侍者欲揮出他。</p>
<p>（二）他苦苦哀求，認其女佣爲其表姐。</p>
<p>（三）女佣允之，他高興，乃與她婆娑起舞。</p>
<p>（四）他對女佣說，從現在起他要吃她燒的魚了。</p>
<p>（五）女佣歡笑。</p>
<p>在這五點中我認爲對前段「最愛吃魚與最恨吃魚」的伏筆，利用得不够好，不够誇張。——劇是需要一些誇張，尤其根據該戲以前的進展，我建議改之如下：</p>
<p>（一）局原有辦法</p>
<p>（二）亦同前</p>
<p>（三）侍者引法蘭支到女佣前，女佣正在大吃其魚。</p>
<p>（四）女佣允之，注兩支大悅坐下，侍者問他吃什麽？他說「魚　」</p>
<p>（五）女佣歡笑，彼此歡笑。</p>
<p>至於婆娑起舞仍然可用，嵌在與（三）之間或者放在（五）後都可，法蘭支吃魚的塲面如要拍特字也可，就是不怕也比現在單單一句話表過爲佳。</p>
<h3>舞台技術講話　色彩的感覺</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>一·人目的授色與感覺</p>
<p>人目的結構，大體彷彿攝影機，組織極爲微妙。其授色的網膜，本來屬於腦之一部，後因發達，遂逐漸遠離中樞。此膜厚度，僅薄如一紙許，從高度顯微鏡下，可分成十層。第九層並列圓柱狀及圓錐狀細胞，關係人目的授色，極為重要。圓柱狀細胞胞端爲纖維，達於第七層，圓銼狀細胞更細長，亦達於第七層，唯其數較少，僅及圓柱細胞之四分之一。其分佈綱膜面的情形，爲中央徽凹入之黃班處，層次漸少，僅餘圓錐狀細胞，黃班外圍，圓柱狀細胞，則又逐漸增加。據瑪克利斯硏究，圖錐狀細胞兼能感光與感色，園柱狀　胞，僅能辦光之明暗。常人之患夜盲，卽圓柱狀　胞有異狀，烏　中有夜明目者，必回柱狀　胞結構異</p>
<p>人目感光，僅繼膜上之兩種　經受光刺激尙不能有所感覺。必須俟此刺激達於神經中樞，始有感覽，此兩神經，除圓往狀細紅緯黃之原色。授色以後，復經明暗神經告以色調，再轉入神經中樞，然後知有某色。職是之故，雖無外光刺激，祇要使細胞興舊而傳及中樞，卽能惑光與色。所以在暗室之中，若以刀切神經，或通電流，目前卽恍如電閃，綠光燦然。又人閉目，雖無上述原因，而以身內血肉呼吸，或自心觀念及幻想刺激，亦同能使目前有所見。</p>
<p>神經之色感及健康，可以舉例證明。若人目被人拳擊，明暗神經當卽受傷，三授色神經，亦因拳擊震動而混亂，於是人便感覺一片暈暗，兩眼金花亂飛，此金花中，便有紅綠黃三色細點。又人如久視太陽，明暗及授色神經均因强烈的陽光而疲倦，待轉至暗處，首先亦覺一片暈暗，金花亂飛；稍憩，紅色授色神經恢復，眼前顯現一片紅光；再遲，綠色授色神經恢復，眼前又現一片綠色；再後黃色授色神經恢復，眼前便現一片黃色。由此兩例，證明圓柱狀細胞較圓錐狀細胞軟弱，三授色神經以黃色最弱，故色盲者，亦多光盲黃色；綠色次之，紅色更次。</p>
<p>色彩因了明度不同，色調不同，性質不同，和歷史上，風俗上，宗敎上的種種關係，能使人目見了起各種不同的感情，這種不同的感情，卽爲整個舞台色彩存在的生命。一個舞台設計者，如果缺乏這種把握與知識，無論如何聰頴，失敗是他必然的果質。</p>
<p>二·色彩的冷暖</p>
<p>色彩的冷暖感覺，是無分光色與染色的。這種知識，在一位設計者，正等於學習英文者必先稔其字母一樣的基本。有此基本認識，始可唯所適從，不致陷於錯誤。一般區別，在光帶上部的赤，橙，黃為暖色，在光帶下部的靑藍是冷色；至黃靑的中間色綠，與　靈的中　色紫，均爲冷明中和色。茲更詳述各色冷暖之感覺於后：</p>
<p>一，赤色：暖色中最暖之色；能引起熱烈，喜悅，煩惱，和狹小的感覺。</p>
<p>二，黃色：暖色；能引起溫暖，高興，光明，歡暢，和莊嚴，高貴，柔弱等感情，並給人一種寬大的感覺。</p>
<p>三，藍色：冷色中最冷之色；能給人一種森嚴，陰慘，和堅硬，狹小的感覺。</p>
<p>四，靑色：冷色；能給人一種深遠，寂寞，空曠的感覺。</p>
<p>五，綠色：冷暖中和色，能給人一種愉快，優閒，新生的感覺。</p>
<p>六，紫色：冷暖中和色；能給人一種溫暖，華貴，美麗的感覺。</p>
<p>七，白色：冷色；能引起人，純潔，簡樸，冬冷，廣闊的感覺。</p>
<p>八，黑色：冷色；能引起人神秘，恐怖，失望，悲哀，狹小，無邊，夜，的感覺。</p>
<p>九，灰色：冷色；能引起人淒涼，陰鬱，冷淡，悲哀，憂愁，沉靜，嚴肅的感覺。（未完）</p>
<h3>程硯秋即將再行登台</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>程硯秋，我們最近聽到他一　「春　夢」，據說他還有和梅蘭芳馬連良合演的「四五在洞」，「王寳川」，又聽說他還要在中國大戲院演幾塲營業戲，傳說是傳說，事實是事實，以後這幾塲戲碼當然亦須要演出方可確定。不過在未演之先，這該是我們戲迷們的好消息。</p>
<p>有人說程硯秋如果正式登合豈不要與梅蘭芳打對台。我說對台也許打，可是打得不會厲害。因爲梅蘭芳有梅蘭芳的觀衆，與程硯秋有連繫性的不過是一部份而已，况且程硯秋登台的日子將在梅蘭芳期滿以後，即使有機會碰頭，梅蘭芳也是偶一爲之的義務戲，所以這個對台不會熱鬧。</p>
<p>至於同馬連良的對台，那也許要打成的，不過這一回他易於占優勢，因爲他再行登台的地點大槪是中國，馬速良則是天蟾。　年老了，嗓子不無變化，梅蘭芳在這一點上已很明顯，程硯秋雖然難逃此律，但較梅蘭芳略好，因爲他所占的便宜是他可多唱程腔。此番他唱「春　夢」也常常有一聲音忽然一低，幾乎一點聲息也沒有，從來又倐的轉出一個高聲來；美其名是「高低婉轉」，其實也是爲著他的年齡在下番掩飾的苦工！</p>
<p>影劇消息</p>
<p>1.「新官上任」即將上演</p>
<p>「新官上任」過去曾提名「魔窟」和「羣魔觀舞」。內容描寫一個我軍撤退後的空城，敵人派了大批漢好去統治，這批漢奸是流氓，殺猪的，私塾老先生，日本人家里的佣人，于是大家搶着你當局長，我當知縣，好像一羣狗在搶一根肉骨頭一樣。但是在另一面，游擊隊在活動着，最後攻進城去，漢奸們都被殺掉。</p>
<p>現在這劇由陶金導演，由章受萍，宗由，方伯等演出，決定十日在蘭心上演。該劇描寫漢奸的無恥媚敵，無微不至，曾有一時期被禁演，現在能在上海演出，真是上海人的眼福不淺。</p>
<p>2.「紅樓夢」九日上演</p>
<p>朱彤的「紅樓夢」次于九日在於華大戲院上演。該　劇是描寫紅樓夢中的賈寳玉和林黛玉的一節，完全是兒女間私情的故事。由吳祖光導演，演員全部是女角。裝　服裝全部古色古香，別有情趣。</p>
<p>3.好萊塢羣芳譜</p>
<p>澳洲美容專家羅碧絲坦夫人暢影都時，會個別訪問各女明星，并加以仔細觀察研究，結果認爲好萊塢最美尤物十位芳名如后：（一）瓊要納，（二）克勞黛爾白，（三）瑙瑪希拉，（四）洛　泰場，（五）海蒂拉馬，（六）白　　史丹妮（七）愛琳鄧，（八）甜兒潘德麗，（九）卡洛郞自，（十）桃樂珊拉摩，按卡洛郎白己去世，尙無人可以後論。羅夫人之選美標準極為嚴格，並不完全以外貌取人，性格姿態，談吐均佔極重要分數，如美人公認麥克何瑟將軍爲美國最美男子之意義相同云，</p>
<p>4.舞台成戰塲</p>
<p>中電工廠之「忠義之家」已近完成偕段前，爲程攝劇中敵僞追捕愛國志士一幕，導演吳永剛爲求其逼眞起見，所用機關槍以實彈射擊。一時如臨大敵，雖以攝影技巧避免危險，然演員演來已汗流夾背。此場攝竣後，該廠一部份墻壁已留下一可紀念之痕跡矣。</p>

<h3>論社會組織（下）</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>根據這個分析，我們知道社會是一個超越個人的有機體，這個有機體祇有一個共同的目標，乃是一個完整的組織，屬於一個統一的領導之下。其間的各個細胞和各部門的器官並不是單純一樣的，各部分分別的擔負着各種不同的工作，但却是彼此配合以求完成同一目標的。根據這個原則，我們可以知道，由現在的許多</p>
<p>國家組織一個「聯合國」，這是可能的，因爲我們在各個國家之上就全人類的福利着想，求出全人類所共有的一個目標，爲完成這個目標各個國家不妨分工介作。但是現在這個「聯合國」的不能產生乃是因爲各個國家祇顧全本國的利害而未曾顧及整個人類的福利。每一個國家有她向己的目標，而每一個目標的完成，免不了破壞別個國家的目標。結果還是戰爭。在各國之間缺乏共同目標的時候所謂「聯合國」徒具外表，最多祗是某些國家爲欲達到其本身的目標所利用的工具或烟幕而已。同樣，假使在幾個政黨之間並沒有眞正的共同目標存在其間而强欲將幾個政黨的主要人物機械的聯合一起以組織一個政府，這樣一個政府也祗徒具外表，最多也祗能使某些黨派達到其本身的目標而已。換言之，假使各政黨祗是代表某一部分的人的利益而各黨之聯合並沒有以整個民族于國家的利益爲共同目標，其所共同組織的統一政府祗是貌合神離，絕不能達到欲使整個國家光明幸福的目標。假使欲求各黨派成功有機性的密切合作，使其各盡所能以求組織一個健全的政府，那末它們一定要放棄其本黨或本人的福利，以在各黨派員標之上，求一個共同爲全民族以至全人類謀福利的大目標。這是一個先決的條件。</p>
<p>社會旣是一個超個人的有機組織，那末個人在社會中是處於怎樣的地位呢？前面我們說過，個人是社會的必需條件，社會是由許多個人所組織成功的。換句話證，個人是社會的組織因素。現在我們再進一步請問個人在社會組織中有沒有自由？現有一般靑年們大聲的喊着說：「我們要自由！我們要澈底的自由！我們要絕對的自由」可是我們郤說個人在社會組織中沒有澈　　自山，更沒有絕對的自由。因爲雖然社會是由個人所組織成功的，但是個人郤反受這個組織的支配。這理由說來很簡單。例如一個學校乃是由許多的敎員學生校工所組織成功的，但是這些敎員學生校工以至於校長個人的行為在學校組織中郤受過各種章程校規所支配的，沒有一個人可以作一種自由的活動。例如校長每天要到辦公室，敎師要照規定的時間表上課，學生也不能隨意上課或下課，一切的一切都在遵守着規定的秩序。誰違背了這個秩序誰就可能失土他在這個組織中的組縱因素的資格，他會遭受這個松序的排斥或責罰。再如幾個人合組一個公司，但他們郤不能單獨在這個公司裏面自由活動。　但是這是否說，個人在社會由完全沒有自由呢？不！並不是沒有自由，每一個人在有社會性的普遍意志之下也有他自己的意志，不過這種自由意志是符合於普遍意志的。簡明的說，個人的行爲祇有在符合於社會秩序之下纔有自由。但是這個社會秩序是否中外一致，古今不變的呢？不！社會秩序在現存的這個世界上是因時因地而不同的。在這個世界上不祇是一個社會而是許多的社會。即使以現在的中國而論，我們還不成其一個完整的秩序，還不成其一個統一的國家，因為我們還可以嘗到幾種不同的社會秩序。這個社會秩序之下是有由的，在那個社會秩序之下便是違法的。這裏可以證明中國現在那個代表全民族福利的社會秩序還沒有穩定下來，人民還摸不淸怎樣去配合這種社會秩序以求得較大的自由。照我們的想像，這個新社會秩序該是實施　政之後的民主中國。</p>
<p>這種新的社會秩序是怎樣產生的呢？我們又可以說，這是在舊社會秩序中個人意志的自由發展。這就是說，在舊社會秩序有少數的先知先覺感覺到生活的不合理，他們看見了一個更能代表公共福利的新秩序，於是他們起來革命，以求實現一個新的社會秋序。然後個人的活動再在這個新的秩序之下受到約束。例如中山光生覺到專制的壓迫和舊禮敎的不合理，於是他便想建立一個三民主義的新中國。這個工作的進展一直到現在還同有完成。這個新社會秩序還需要更多的人來努力，這先導的工作和個人的努力便是個人自由意志的表現。因此。我們可以結論說，在某一種社會之下個人祇有符合於這種社會秩序的自由活動，否則，個人的自由便是在推翻這個社會而組織一個新的秩序。但是這種革命性的自由也是有條件的。一則這種革命的先覺要得看淸楚更發展的趨勢；二則要把握得住眞正的時代需要。革命的成功建築在全民族乃至全人類的福利上，而並不是建築在少數人的情緒上，更不是建築在某黨某派的利害關係上。</p>

<h3>淡水</h3>
<p>— 施灣美</p>
<p>——獻給一個朋友——</p>
<p>我好像看見過你，當朝露似的童年，開著小紫花的棚下，曾　十同嬉戲；但是，爲什麽？直到那一年秋天，北雁在長空裏南飛的時候，你才握住我的手說：「相逢何必曾相識？』我點點顯，笑著，沒有說什麽，好瞰承認你說得不錯；淡淡的秋天的陽光裏，竹離上開滿了紅色的蔦雜花，我奇怪它怎麽不是紫色的？</p>
<p>那一天的太陽即使不比別一大輝煌，却至少是最令人歡喜，在我的記憶裏。可是我從來也沒有將這話吿訴過你，在冷雨寒冬的黃昏，我們　爐談話的時候，在暮春的暖夜，我們搶著吃那藍色玻璃岔裏的櫻桃的時候；在黃梅季節，我們散步於乍雨乍晴的衝頭之際，我沒有提起，沒有提起。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？也許你比我更明白：『我們都太老了，如果是小孩子，中學時代的姑娘，絕不願輕意疏遠掉自己喜悅的朋友，有時候，人們吝嗇感情的施予，往往超過可見的物質……」你坦然承認信寫了常常不寄，原來我們全都害怕被人說是「自作多情」，啊！我不知這，從什麽時候起？冷淡比熱誠傲，疏遠强似親蜜？多荒應，又多不合情理。</p>
<p>記得有一次，在給你的信中，我寫下句：「我討厭我自己」，三天後你的回信來了，不再是往日的寥寥數語，電報式的短簡；這回，淡荷色的信箋上，轉載了一節英國女作家Katherine　Mansfieled的手記：『一年前我們一起在火爐旁坐着，她和我，手牽手，頰對頰，不議話，有時低聲呢語，這房間是黝黑的，火光弱得可憐，外面的雨聲又很響。她弱小的身體裏在長柔的黑衣內，頸上套了一串紫水晶，漸漸地我們覺得很冷，我就從牀上拖起一條毯子披在我們身上，微笑的說：「我們像小孩子，在一座荒島上」，她一隻手拉起這粗毛的毯子的一角，另一隻手放在我的手上，我們談起盛名，我們如何渴慕它，應該如何努力，我們談起我們的計劃，我找到一張白紙，我們就一起寫一張誓，立志預備在一年內成名，我們簽了字，封了起來，丢入火內，獻給天主，一時火光熊熊，瞬息便成一堆灰，不久她就墮入夢鄕，我將毯子全給她蓋，還給她一個枕頭，這綿長的冷晚便如此拖延下去，我對着她看，腦中充滿了思想和渴念，可是我終不能入睡。今天，在天地另一角，我在受難，她毫無疑問，已在二月大市塲內買了一頂帽帽子。」我感動得哭了，流下眼淚；手記的後面還有你自己的話：「……以後，不知道在那一個日子上，我在担心，我們竟會在某一個大市塲內，不的而同的爭買一頂帽子……」我吿訴你：「假使有一天眞如你所預想的話，那麼，我一定會將那頂帽子讓給你，我早已失去爭買帽子的信心和勇氣了，何况是你，就是爲了這一封信，我也要將帽子犧牲了奉戲給你」我們曾這樣來回的痴人說夢，也許犯了幼稚的毛病，但部是由衷的。世界上有多少由衷之言不是夢話，瘋話，傻話呢？旣然歡喜說，又不討厭聽，爲什麽不就這樣寫呢？</p>
<p>記得曾經有人對我說過：從前我有孤獨者的驕傲，現在，我只有孤獨者的悲哀了。」一個多麽愚蠢的說法啊！因爲孤獨者的驕傲原只是他的悲哀，他的悲袁也就是孤獨者的驕傲。　我們驕傲麽？不，因爲我們沒有悲哀。在這廣漠的人海裏，我們還有不少的朋友，並且也有一二知音，你說：「……在暮色蒼茫中，在微雨的黃昏內，在有著星光的夜色下，你最容易使人想憶，因爲你是屬於這一個世界的……」可不，當那鶯春，雁夜，燭底，簫邊，一切驚大動地的塲面忘懷了，一切歌哭與共的故事忘懷了，只有你，只有你一個最遙遠而又是接近的朋友，一聲嘆息，好像在幾百年前？又好像在一刹那那間？半個微笑，在眼前，也在天邊？是浪漫中的現實，無意議中的有意義，是時間，空閒，環境的廢除……但是，在衣香　影的華筵上，我從不曾想起過你，你也未必記得我！？</p>
<p>有人說：「一人生是友誼」，那麽，什麼是我們的友誼呢？死生相共的患難之交好比曠世的悲劇故事，談笑風生語言相投的朋友如同濃冽的葡萄酒，因爲他們「千杯少」；可是我們呢？這一點若有若無，半深半淺，又遠又近的綠分是什麽？那不會是塵埃？但也絕不是心田上的玫塊；有點像輕描淡寫的中國山水。於是我想起一句話：「君子之交淡如水」，我不是君子，但是却撮然的將它借用了；淡水，在生命的杯裏，也許不是名貴的，但是却不可少。你願意與我同飲麽？我要用紫色的鬱金香花代替那生命的杯，淺淺的斟上奉獻給你。</p>
<h3>論劉獅畫</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>東坡曾有「論畫以形似，見與兒童鄰」之說，這種偏重性靈而忽略形象的見解，是指絕端文化學的士大夫繪畫而言，並非所有的繪畫，都根據這個標準去批評的。吸爲繪畫畢竟是一種象形美術，性靈的發揮，神韵的生動，都是寄託在形象之中的，謝赫六法中所以把「氣韵生動」和「應物象形」並提。張　稱「外師造化，中得心源」，師造化，便是忠實描寫求其形象的意思，得心源，便是在形象之中求其性靈表現的意思。倪雲林「寫我胸中逸氣」，也不過加强性重的重要性，形象在繪畫上畢竟有牠重要的地位。</p>
<p>繪盡上形象的成功，是利用點線面配合的——六法中所謂骨法用筆。無論其山水，人物，花烏魚蟲等，都是不可缺少的，點線面，不但要輕鬆流利，而且要沈著渾厚，然後描寫各種形象，無不唯肖唯妙。從描寫真實中求其肖，從筆墨技巧中求其妙，唐韓幹畫馬，嘗對玄宗說：「天潢十萬匹，皆臣師也」。他能越筆點簇州鞍馬，勝倚，龁飲，驚止，走起等各種形狀，畫得千變萬化，宛然若生。便是從眞實描寫而達於神韵境界的一個例子。</p>
<p>美專敎授劉獅，是從彫塑着手而致力於西畫的一位天才藝術家，抗戰期間，在大後方歷盡艱險，曾在砲火迷漫中度他藝術生活，在困苦的環境中轉變他藝術作風，利用毛筆宣紙，從事於責際物狀中觀察體騐，描寫出水棲動物的幽美姿態，相等於韓幹的畫馬，取材於天潢十萬匹，成功了畫史上不多見的畫魚家，把金魚，鯉魚，等各種魚類的動態，活潑潑地表現之於畫面，甚至連最富流動性的「水」，也透明地移之入畫，使人看了有身臨濠上之感，這種技巧的成熟，充分說明了他在點線面筆法的功力，同時也可以證明他已從形象的「外師造化」而進了神齣的「中得心源」之階段了！</p>
<p>長篇連載</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（四九）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>因爲廖老闆儘管心地很好，脾氣可不好！廖老　是四川人的脾氣：小惱，則駡；大惱，則打；老闆娘兇是兇，對於廖老闆却有幾分懼怯。動嘴動手都不是廖老闆的敵手，所以滿肚子寃氣，只有往別人身上發洩。廖棟不在家，便輪着那些店裏的夥計們倒霉，上自製藥師父，下至徒弟，每天每人總免不了，被老闆娘找個岔兒叨嘮一頓。瞭解了老闆娘的心理，誰也不去計較。這些人在老闆娘的眼裏連猪都不如，她記得在娘家時，養一隻猪，只是喂牠吃，等到殺了以後就能謙上一大筆錢。而這些人，不但養他們，還要給工炎，可也沒見有什麼用處？所以只要她心裏煩了，就要嚷着：『你們這羣猪都不如的東西，你們都該殺喲』！可是那些夥計們會回答她：『我們不該殺，老闆娘！不是嗎？你並沒把我們養肥呀！瞧吧，誰肥，誰才該殺哩』！老闆娘吃了虧！知道他們是奚落自己肥；自己該殺；於是「啞吧吃黃連」，便再也一聲不哼了！肚子越發漲得像一面鼓。</p>
<p>廖老闆和墨老爺原是熱人，墨老爺生前常常到「回春堂」買參，算是「回春堂」的老主顧了，因此廖老闆對墨老爺特別客氣，索價總比別人低些。而且墨老爺有時沒有錢，廖老闆就給他記上一筆賬。後來馬老爺病了，墨太太不付華錢，墨盛又只好向「回春堂」除賬，直到墨老爺死了，墨太太才付淸那筆欠債。這次寳鈴的到「回春堂」工作，也是凑巧。寳鈴正在四面八方找事做，有一天聽廖棟說：他們店裏需要一位記賬員。寳鈴得到這個消息，便連忙親自去找廖老闆，吿訴廖老闆他可以擔任這個職務。廖老闆起初還不相信，看見寳鈴再三地懇求，才認眞地答應了。講好一個月管吃管住，外送十吊錢的零花。心裏却不免感嘆地說：「想不到皇親國戚的後代，如今混到藥材店裏來當記賬員」。</p>
<p>賓鈴搬到「回春堂」以後，殷勤謹愼地工作，小心翼翼地應付人事。白天，整日價坐在店裏櫃臺後面一張小條桌前記錄每項進出賬目。稍一空暇的時候，便孜孜不倦地看書。到了晚上，把賬目總精一下，然後交給廖老闆審査一番，對淸了數額，這一天的工作，算是吿一個段落。此外便是業務上對於廖棟學業的帮助，他把自已念過的書，一一都敎給了廖棟，使廖棟得到不少的益處，所以廖棟敬他如師長！而他也感到莫大的快慰，因爲這樣使他减少許多的寂寞，與工作上的枯燥。在這個家裏，除了廖楝他還願意接近其他都使他厭憎！但是他並不能滿意廖棟的性格，他覺得廖棟小小年紀，就會感傷，是不對的！而且像女孩兒似的憂鬱在心裏，有委屈也不言語，動不就掩面而泣！一雙深凹的小眼睛，經常是紅紅的。這樣於是免不了影響健康！瘦瘦的脊膚靑黃的臉色，眉頭從來不曾展開過，看上去，給人的印象就是多愁善病！因此，寳鈴常常勸導這個小朋友，他想把自己的堅强與果敢去激勵廖棟，改變廖棟！他的境過並不優於廖棟，他自信他已是過來人，他將先敎廖棟站起來。</p>
<h3>山坡上的故事</h3>
<p>— 張鳳羽</p>
<p>這是一座小山坡，在離重慶百餘里的一個小鎭底背後。在牠上面可以望見嘉陵江繞了一個大彎子緩緩地流過去；還可以望見江對岸像一　　草一般的竹林，和竹林旁邊玩具般的房屋，輕巧地放在細緻的，褐色的，像尼羅河畔的少女底皮膚的土地上。</p>
<p>別小看了這座山坡，作爲一個無言的證人，牠也知道一些——雖則是小小的！故事呢！</p>
<p>是春天，是這山坡上種著菜花，而這茶花已經黃了的季節；是早晨，是那淸醒的風，吹送着春天的音樂和呼吸的時候。江面上飛翔着白鷗，雪白的白鷗，亮得耀目，陽光衝擊到她們底背上，像要迸發出一長串，　亮的，銀鈴般的笑聲。春天把困人的妖媚，散布在一切上面，菜花給自已的重量壓彎了腰，在牠每一朶黃金的花心裏酣睡着音樂的精靈，輕微地顫動着，等待蜜蜂飛來喚醒他們。</p>
<p>這時，有一個高大而瘦削的，裏着一件黑色的長斗蓬的靑年男子，慢慢地走上山坡來。除了顏面和脚以外，他全身都裹在這斗蓬裏，而且因爲這斗蓬峻直，悲傷的垂紋，使他好像一隻被剪去翅膀的烏兒。他站定了，在山坡上卸下他長而黑的影子。</p>
<p>像一座石像挺立在那兒，背景一幅幅地更換了：早晨底淡青色的天，中午底深監的天，傍晚底點綴着紅霞的天……他才慢慢地走下山坡去。</p>
<p>一天，一天……春風拂過他短短的，顯然是新留起來的頭髮，夏雲襯著他商大的身影，秋雨淋濕他黑色的斗蓬，到了山坡上已經種着　麥，而這喬麥已經在山坡上撤滿了他粉紅色的小花的時節。</p>
<p>八月中秋底傍晚，他照例地立在那兒，背朝着他上來的路，面向着江水。</p>
<p>秋天底天是高的，雲是輕的。殷紅的夕陽是一切色彩的中心，秋雲隨着牠幻成無數種燦爛的顏色，江水也被牠抹上一筆濃厚的鑫紅，隨着江水的波動，在晚風裏顫抖着。漸漸地，夕陽落下去了，打霞冷成憂鬱的紫色，沉下來，沉下來，沉到山峯上，沉到江面上，雲後面也出現了一點自的什麽，那是月亮，但還是遙達的，神奇的，像一個飄　的夢。</p>
<p>應當是　——那個青年男子——下山回去的時候了，但他仍舊立在那兒沒有走。</p>
<p>月亮一步步地走近了，淸晰了，雲已逐漸地淡去，黃昏星也睜開了她底明眸，夜底靑色代替了黃昏底紫色。月光底寒流，傾瀉在山峯上，傾瀉在江面，傾瀉在　麥花上；山峯上舖滿了霜，江面上爍閃着銀色，喬麥花如一片白雪。浸在這淡靑的寒流裏的人，戰慄了。</p>
<p>那靑年男子溥回身去——他那在月光下的面容是多麽蒼白呵——想從他上來的那條路回去。突然，他立定了，退後一步，春着一個由那條路上來的少女。</p>
<p>那少女也立定了，她底美麗的嘴唇顫動產，像在說什麽話，最後，她底語聲已淸晰地—雖然很低—聽到了：</p>
<p>「……你……是你……我終於找到你了……三年……三年呵……除了留下一封信說你上前砍去了以外，什麽信息都沒有……多麽偶然……我又得到你了……我決不再失去你第二次了……擔抱我吧！」</p>
<p>他恐怖地退後了。</p>
<p>「　抱我……來……擁抱我吧……什麽你退後呢？爲什麼你躲開呢？不願嗎……」</p>
<p>他更恐怖地退後了。</p>
<p>「擁抱我！用你底手……用你底健壯的，常常擁抱得使我身體　痛的手……你底常常拿了我底黑變，做成你底烏玉的指環的手；用你底一常常托著我底櫻唇，做成你底青春的酒杯的手……」</p>
<p>他戰抖着，要想說出一句答語來，但他用盡了他底力量，也只能府下，頭來，用手齒咬斷他頸前斗逢的紐帶。</p>
<p>於是，黑色的長斗蓬落下了</p>
<p>她恐怖地退後，接着跪倒在他脚前，用幾乎聽不見的聲音說</p>
<p>「什麽！你已經失去了…</p>
<p>「是……的……」他回答，從像被人扼住了底喉嚨裏，掙扎出幾個字來：「我把牠們供獻了……爲國家。」</p>
<p>第二年的中秋前，我偶然到了這個小鎮　；那天晚上，我偶然在這個山坡上睡倒了看月。晚風用　輕柔的手指圖上了我底眼皮，萬縷星光梳著我底頭髮，月亮用她透明的靑色的提琴，奏一支小夜間為我催眠；山腰間，江面上，一條似的輕烟，把現實的世界都　無數了。我睡着了，做了一個夢，聽見我耳朶旁邊的一株小草，在江水底嘆息裏，吿訴我以上的故事。</p>
<h3>幸福的製造者</h3>
<p>— 唐軻</p>
<p>是一個下著綿綿細雨的陰天。</p>
<p>在那泥濘汚足的街口，我遇着你這個自己看不見世界面目，而又把這世界狀貌顯示給視覺淸明者的眼前的賣報者。</p>
<p>我不知道你活着爲的是自己，抑或是爲了別人？</p>
<p>呵！你那樣的不避風雨吹打，整天價依持着替代你那視覺的竹杖，輕觸着沿途的地面，你走遍街坊，巷口……嘴里叫着：</p>
<p>「報要哦……」</p>
<p>誰說你是爲著延續自己的生命，才這樣的往來一奔走？你却是指引那些一亮眼瞎子，接近眞理，看見閃耀着的光明；你沒有殘喘地度着餘生，而是爲廣大的人類，輸送着精神食糧！</p>
<p>人們接受了你那精神的營養，日益壯大；而你却在風雨里消瘦！你為的是誰呢？</p>
<p>我担心着你那憔悴得像乾柴一樣的身體，不久，定會給風雨腐蝕，終於長眼地下！</p>
<p>這世界誠然汚穢得像你行走着的街道一樣，不値得你留戀，然而當你瞑目九泉的剎那，你可知道世界上尙遺留着多少長著眼睛，而又看不見世界狀貌的人哪！啊！你忍心悄悄地離開他們麼？何况你是在醫治著這個充斥着罪惡的世界，像健康者一樣？</p>
<p>又是一個下着綿綿細雨的陰天。</p>
<p>在那可能每天碰到你的街頭，我已看不到你的足跡，聽不到你的聲音，莫非你眞的嫌這個世界太　，偸偸地離開了人間？……</p>
<p>處身在這風雨如晦的氛圍里，眼前　着宛如垃圾桶的世界，失去了你這個背負起人類苦難的十字架的賣報瞎子，我感到混身抖戰，心胸間充沛着無限的惆悵！爲什麽世界祇允許危害人的人存在呢？……我不忍再想了。</p>
<p>呵！你這精神食糧的輸送者，我爲你祝福，使你的靈魂得到安慰。然而這無補實際的支持，空虛得像一張白紙，不發生一點些微的力量！</p>
<p>我與你活着的時候相較，我感到自身　的脆弱，多少亮眼的人，那里能像你一樣的不辭勞苦，不遭風雨，爲人類製造幸一福而奔走？</p>
<p>即使你的瞳孔失去了活力，而你還是像明眼人一樣；因爲你知道。能够爲他人製造幸福，自已才能眞眞的得到幸福！</p>

<h3>Decisions from the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Meeting: Land Tax Collection in Kind Extended for One Year; Chairman's Admonition to Pay Attention to the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] The meeting to revise the national fiscal revenue and expenditure system continued its review session on the morning of the 8th, discussing the unfinished proposals from the 1st and 3rd groups from yesterday. The issue of continuing to collect taxes in kind was discussed in detail. Many spoke about the reality of rural poverty, and that the Executive Yuan would be unable to maintain [the current system] this time. The third general meeting was convened at 3 PM, presided over by Minister Xu. Chairman Chiang arrived at the meeting at 3:37 PM. Everyone stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman walked to the stage, put on his glasses, sat upright for three minutes, and surveyed the surroundings of the venue. He then stood up to give a speech, finishing at 4:05 PM, and then left immediately. The content of the Chairman's admonition specifically explained the extension of the collection [of taxes in kind] for one year. He also hoped that the representatives of each province, after returning to their respective regions, would convey this intention to each county and city, as this one year is truly the most difficult stage. This concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the survival of the nation, so everyone must understand and assist in completing this matter. He then cited three matters as the focal points of the work of each representative in the future: (1) Land measurement; (2) Population census; (3) Reorganization of the Baojia system. After the speech, everyone was deeply moved. The meeting then continued with the report of the review. The proposals of the 1st and 2nd groups, with the exception of the first case and minor modifications to each case, were passed according to the review opinions. The meeting adjourned on the 9th. The general meeting will continue at 10 AM on the morning of the 10th, and may conclude in the afternoon. The review opinion on the tax exemption and requisition portion of the first case was: "The land tax that should be exempted will be reduced and exempted on average over three years. This year's land tax collection fee and requisitioned grain will each be collected at two-thirds of the fixed amount," and was changed to: "The land tax that should be exempted will be reduced and exempted on average over two years. This year's land tax collection in kind and requisitioned grain will each be collected at one-half of the fixed amount." This was then brought up for discussion again due to the Chairman's instructions on this matter. Finally, it was decided to submit it to the Chairman for approval according to the review opinions. Also, tonight, Ministers Yu and Xu jointly hosted a banquet for the attending representatives.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended the fiscal revenue and expenditure system meeting at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th and addressed the more than 170 attendees, saying first: This meeting will not only clarify the central and local fiscal revenue and expenditure system, but it can also determine the future direction of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and its mission is extremely important. During the meeting period, everyone gathered their thoughts and wisdom and made many important resolutions. It is hoped that everyone will implement them one by one after returning, and only then can the people's suffering be alleviated, and the nation's finances be restored to normal as soon as possible. This meeting decided to extend the land tax collection in kind for one year. This measure is necessary to complete the reconstruction work. However, local grain bureaus must especially consider the people's suffering when collecting taxes in kind, reduce collection procedures, and strictly prohibit harsh disturbances in order to facilitate the people. Chairman Chiang finally mentioned three matters: land measurement, population census, and property registration, which he considered to be the basic work of nation-building, and he hoped that everyone would work together to complete these three important tasks to lay the foundation for nation-building.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting Held in Yan'an; Report of Mao Zedong's Visit to Nanjing Unconfirmed; Mo Dehui, et al. Visit Marshall for Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] According to those with reliable sources: After Lu Dingyi returned to Yan'an last night to meet with Mao Zedong, the CCP headquarters in Yan'an held a high-level cadre meeting that lasted until midnight. On the 8th, the CCP leaders in Yan'an continued to hold joint meetings in the morning and afternoon. It is heard that today's meeting, in addition to continuing to discuss the important issues related to ceasefire, road restoration, and reorganization and unification of the military listed in the announcement of the ceasefire by the Chairman of the National Government, also put forward for discussion the ceasefire proposals drafted by the CCP representatives, including Zhou Enlai. Judging from the speeches of the CCP representatives and self-proclaimed "third parties" in the past thirty-six hours, the CCP has clearly focused its attention on the so-called modification of the "five-to-one" ratio in the original military reorganization plan in the Northeast, hoping to further preserve the superior strength of the Northeast Communist Army. Since the CCP has placed the focus of future negotiations on military affairs, its future movements are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] Tonight, it is widely rumored here that Zhou Enlai may return to Nanjing tomorrow night, and it is also rumored that Mao Zedong is planning to come to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and to answer Marshall, so as to have further cordial talks with all parties. If the situation does have the possibility of a turn for the better, Mao may stay in Nanjing and personally direct the CCP representatives attending the Military Mediation Tripartite Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group meeting, so as to avoid delays in returning to [Yan'an] for instructions when major problems occur. After this news came out, observers in Nanjing made the following speculations: (1) The CCP will change its strategy and political strategy, and use a peaceful offensive to win the sympathy of the Chinese people; (2) The CCP will seize this fleeting precious opportunity and use various soft methods to create a very strong peaceful atmosphere, so that the government and the American side will be elated, indulge in reconciliation and be unable to extricate themselves, and make the third party exhaust their efforts, be obsessed with the opportunity, and be complacent, in order to achieve their goal of delaying the current situation. However, as of tonight, it has not been proven that Mao Zedong will accompany Zhou Enlai to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] It is reported that Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, and Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League, and Li Huang, Chen Qitian, and Mo Dehui of the Youth Party, submitted the following opinions to Marshall on the 8th: (1) Extend the ceasefire period; (2) During the ceasefire period, military and political coordination must be considered simultaneously to resolve [the issues].</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, left for Shanghai by car on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, social notables Mo Dehui, Democratic League representatives Liang Shuming, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji, and Youth Party representatives Li Huang and Chen Qitian, went to Haining Road to meet with Marshall. They exchanged views on unity and peace issues for about two hours, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. After the representatives left Marshall, they discussed for a long time at the Youth Party office in Fengyi Village.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Plans for Reorganization and Demobilization; Military Reorganization Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow; Mediation Work in the Northeast Awaits Commencement</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters has scheduled a military reorganization meeting for the 10th of this month to discuss four issues, including reorganization and demobilization. If the KMT-CCP problem is completely resolved within half a month of the ceasefire, the military reorganization work of the Executive Headquarters can be quickly launched, and it is hoped that it will start in the Northeast first. Recently, Chairman Chiang telegraphed instructions to the Executive Headquarters, stating that there must be a time limit attached to the military reorganization process, otherwise we will not know when the reorganization will begin. Currently, the second phase of the reorganization of the National Army in the Yangtze River region will be completed by the end of June, and the third phase of the National Army in North China is scheduled to be carried out in July and August. The CCP has not yet proposed the numbers and roster of the troops they intend to retain. The CCP explained that the conflict has not yet stopped, and transportation and communication are difficult, so they cannot submit them. However, they claimed that local reorganization is already underway in some areas. The Zhangjiakou Military Training School, jointly run by the CCP and the US, has already started training more than 100 translators to translate the teaching of the American instructors to the officers and soldiers being trained after the school opens.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters has added a Deputy Commissioner. The government side has internally decided on Cai Wenzhi, and the CCP side had originally decided on Rao Shushi. Since Rao will go to Changchun, there is talk of changing to Luo Ruiqing. (Note: Cai and Luo are both chiefs of staff.) The American side has not yet heard of who will be appointed.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Liberation Daily Publishes a Strong Anti-American Commentary; Nanjing Central Daily Rebuts It Sharply</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Amidst the propaganda for ceasefire, the Yan'an Broadcasting Station broadcast an editorial from the Liberation Daily on the 5th. First, it stated that the United States should immediately stop fueling the Chinese civil war. It not only wantonly vilified the government but also slandered the Allied nation of the United States. Its intentions are unpredictable and have attracted great attention from Chinese and foreign personages. The main points are recorded below: US President Truman's statement on China policy issued on December 15 last year ended the Hurley policy. Therefore, when US Special Envoy General Marshall came to China in December last year, based on the above-mentioned policy, to promote a ceasefire in China and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, all work was also trusted and enthusiastically cooperated with by the Chinese people. According to the constraints of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Three Powers, the United States should stop and withdraw any assistance to the Kuomintang government's civil war and dictatorial policies, especially military assistance. Only in this way will Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war not become a futile decoration.</p>
<p>But the facts are completely the opposite. When the Chinese civil war and reign of terror became more serious day by day, the reactionaries in the US government continued to strengthen their assistance to the Kuomintang government supported by the Chinese reactionaries, especially continuing to provide rampant assistance in military transportation and arms supply. Obviously, the civil wars in North China and the Northeast could only have occurred and intensified after the United States transported troops and arms on behalf of the Kuomintang. Without the military transportation of the United States, it would have been fundamentally impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to carry out large-scale civil wars in the Northeast and North China.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese surrender (that is, in a civil war rather than in the War of Resistance) to the present, the American Navy, Army and Air Force have been stationed in various parts of China day and night, repeatedly stating that they will not withdraw, and repeatedly postponing their withdrawal. Now even the families of the US troops have been transported to China, indicating that the US military has regarded China as their base. They not only help the instigators of the civil war transport troops in China, but also help them guard and repair ports, railways, mines, train them to fight, and use American-supplied bombers, warships, tanks, artillery and other various weapons of murder, and even conduct espionage work. After the end of the War of Resistance against Japan and the beginning of the civil war in China, the United States equipped the instigators of the civil war with 40 American-equipped divisions (the US only equipped 20 divisions during the War of Resistance, and most of these 20 divisions were also used in the civil war, and were not used in the War of Resistance), organized the Navy and Air Force, and supplied them with large quantities of aircraft, ships, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, gasoline, and all other war materials, even the daily necessities of officers and soldiers. Obviously, without the US military aid, the Chinese reactionaries would not be able to carry out large-scale civil wars.</p>
<p>Under the above circumstances, the Chinese people cannot help but suspect the fact today. Is it the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy that requires the US's rampant military intervention, or the US's rampant military intervention that requires the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy? The Chinese people cannot but notice that the US's military intervention cannot be without imperialist purposes. Maybe one day the United States will ask China for military bases and political and economic rights, making China virtually reduced to a protectorate and colony of the United States, and the Chinese reactionaries' act of sacrificing the interests of the country, nation, and the people's lives and property in exchange for US military intervention in order to consolidate their dictatorial position is an act of traitors and national thieves. In any case, the military intervention of the reactionaries in the US government is endangering China's national security and is obviously inconsistent with Truman's declaration not to interfere with China's internal disputes by military intervention and Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war. Therefore, this erroneous policy of the United States has been criticized and blamed in all aspects in the United States and in China.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are still being slaughtered by foreign weapons after the end of the war against Japan. This is the weapon of the United States. The disaster of the Chinese people today is fundamentally bestowed by the policy of the American reactionaries to create and fuel the Chinese civil war. The military intervention of the United States has turned many solemn words in Truman's statement into untrustworthy words and made the United States' mediation status in the Chinese civil war suspicious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Nanjing Central Daily published an editorial today entitled "Arrogant Propaganda War," sharply rebutting the Liberation Daily editorial of the 5th. First, it stated: This editorial broke the agreement to publicize the ceasefire and launched a fierce anti-American movement, vehemently attacking our National Government. We only need to quote one or two sentences from it to see Yan'an's view of the United States and our National Government. After slandering the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, they pointed out that the current situation in China is "the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy requires the US's rampant military assistance, and the US's rampant military intervention requires the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy." They pointed out, "Maybe one day the United States will ask China for military bases and political and economic rights, making China virtually reduced to a protectorate and colony of the United States." They pointed out, "The US's military intervention is endangering China's national security, endangering China's peace and democracy, and endangering Sino-US friendship and world peace." As long as it is a Chinese person who loves China, hearing the Communist Party's such arrogant propaganda war rhetoric, they will definitely be able to judge that the Communist Party is about to launch an ominous anti-American movement and acts of resistance against the government, and they will definitely be able to see that we do not have reason to be overly optimistic about the government's fifteen-day ceasefire for troops in the Northeast in order to urge the Communist Party to fulfill the agreements they previously participated in.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party has repeatedly launched anti-American movements. This editorial by the Liberation Daily is the most intense literary attack in the past reactionary propaganda wars. We must first explore why the Communist Party wants to be so strongly anti-American. We know that the Communist Party's greatest attempt is to destroy China, the force of stability on the Asian continent, while the United States' world policy is to hope and help China build a unified, strong, democratic, and free country to achieve its mission of securing Asia. Conversely, the Communist Party's creed is "chaos is the capital of revolution." What the Communist Party prays for is Chinese chaos and world unrest. For this reason, it does not hesitate to provoke China's internal strife, and for this reason, it does not hesitate to provoke the Third World War. The Communist Party's goal is the opposite of the goal of China's nation-builders, and also the opposite of the purpose of Sino-US cooperation. Therefore, they have repeatedly launched anti-American movements, and in the near future, there will be even more ominous anti-American movements.</p>
<p>The newspaper then stated: Today, General Marshall is making the final, greatest, and most determined efforts for China's peace, security, democracy, and the rule of law, and the Communist Party is actually launching a propaganda war that directly criticizes General Marshall. None of the parts of this propaganda war text concerning General Marshall are true, but one thing we must point out today is that the strengthening of General Marshall's arbitral power is because the National Government, the only legitimate government of China, believes that if the functions of the military conflict mediation and executive department are not strengthened, they will not be sufficient to complete the mediation responsibilities. Therefore, it hopes that General Marshall will use a firm and impartial attitude to make a more powerful arbitration for China's domestic military conflicts. This is by no means the United States interfering in China's internal affairs. General Marshall's mission has absolutely no flaws that can be criticized.</p>
<p>After the Japanese surrender, the American forces continued to operate in China to end the matters that should have ended on the Chinese battlefield. This mission is correct, legitimate, and worthy of praise from every Chinese person, and the American military's assistance in transporting Chinese government troops into the Northeast is to assist China in restoring its territorial sovereignty in the Northeast. The Northeast issue can only be fundamentally resolved under Chinese sovereignty by providing its resources and markets for the prosperity of the world and mankind with international cooperation and an open-door policy. We firmly believe that the National Government has no intention of adopting a blockade policy in the Northeast and spreading seeds that are harmful to peace and security in the Far East and the world. We believe that the first Chinese person should treat the two great friendly nations of the United States and the Soviet Union equally. Therefore, understanding these two points, we see that the Communist Party's anti-American movement is harmful to China's path to nation-building and to the hope of Sino-US-Soviet cooperation to stabilize the Far East and the world. The Liberation Daily's attack on the National Government is a common occurrence, but we are very surprised that they have put forward the term "national security" this time. We want to ask them whether the actions of their "democratic allied forces" in the Northeast are for national security, and which of their actions in the Northeast is nationalistic. I believe that when they put forward the word "nation," they are ashamed and cowardly in their hearts. Finally, we hope that the Communist Party, for the sake of the foundation of China's nation-building, for the sake of striving for and maintaining peace and security in the Far East and the world, will calmly reflect and fervently become aware, and completely change their strategy of creating chaos and destroying peace.</p>

<h3>Northeast Quiet Yesterday; Bode Seeks Residence in Changchun</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] Entering the second day of the ceasefire, an official in charge told reporters this morning that the Northeast was quiet yesterday. The only news of conflicts was all those that occurred before June 7. However, the Military Mediation Department has not yet been able to send a large number of personnel to the Northeast. The government side has not yet decided on the personnel to participate in the Changchun Executive Department Forward Command Post. Although the CCP has decided on Rao Shushi, Rao has not yet left Shenyang for Changchun. The CCP claims that it has not yet received instructions from Yan'an to send additional personnel to the Northeast, so there is no way to prepare. The Northeast mediation work will have to wait until Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing from Yan'an and reaches an agreement with the government before active preparations can be made. Today is Saturday, and the men and women of the KMT, CCP, and the US sides of the Executive Headquarters had already been on the phone this morning inviting friends to spend this weekend, which is more relaxed and full of hope for peace than in the past few months. [Our Changchun Office, 7th Dispatch] Bode was accompanied by Mayor Shangjianshi Chuandao and others this morning to look for a house in the city. He personally inspected even the toilets, seeking a suitable place for office work. Bode said that Zhou Enlai expressed his joy at his trip.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The Legislative Yuan held its 301st regular meeting on the morning of the 8th, with over sixty members present. President Sun chaired the meeting.

Executive Yuan Vice President Weng Wenhao, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Economic Minister Wang Yunwu, Food Minister Lu Kan, and Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director Jiang Tingfu were specially dispatched to attend and answer questions. Director Jiang began by reporting on the progress of relief and rehabilitation efforts and then departed. Subsequently, legislators Lou Tongsun, Wei Tingsheng, Dai Xiujun, Sun Jiulu, Jian Guansan, Chen Guyuan, Chen Chunfeng, Cheng Yuanzhen, and Liu Guanxun raised numerous questions regarding current financial, economic, monetary, trade, food, and public education personnel salary issues. Ministers Yu, Xu, and Wang responded separately. In his response, Yu revealed that the treasury's income and expenditure gap for the year was quite significant. He stated that the solution depended on domestic stability and increased tax revenue. Yu stated that there were still technical difficulties in implementing a property tax at present, and the issuance of public bonds also depended on currency stability. Furthermore, Minister Yu also revealed that it was not easy to change the foreign exchange rate easily and that tariff rates were being drafted for revision, with the new rates containing protectionist characteristics. In his report, Minister Xu pointed out that the Department had not received a large amount of enemy and puppet storage in warehouses and acknowledged that there was indeed mold in some warehouses. Minister Wang Yunwu still adhered to his "abacus" principle, reporting to the members that, excluding the Northeast and Taiwan, sales of enemy and puppet properties in various regions had reached 108.1 billion yuan to date, and it was possible that another 230.9 billion yuan would be received this year, totaling approximately 665.6 billion yuan, not too far from the 704.7 billion yuan listed in the national budget revenue.

<h3>Guangdong Province Second Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Tanaka Claims Ignorance of Atrocities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th] Guangdong Province held its first public trial of Japanese war criminals on the 7th. The defendant was former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and Governor-General of Hong Kong, Tanaka Hisaichi (Lieutenant General). The presiding judge was Major General Liu Yannian, President of the Military Tribunal of the Headquarters, and Professor Xue Siguang, a renowned lawyer from the Law Department of Zhongshan University, was appointed as the defendant's defense counsel. Tanaka was escorted from the detention center to the court at 9:10 AM. Prosecutor Cai Lijin first read the indictment, which stated that the Japanese army had wantonly killed civilians, raped, looted, and committed all kinds of atrocities in Guangdong and Guangxi. As the highest military commander in South China, the defendant failed to implement strict controls beforehand and failed to punish afterwards, thereby violating Article 24 of the Regulations on Punishment of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Tanaka refuted the indictment, stating that he had not treated the people harshly since taking office in March of the 32nd year of the Republic, and the indictment lacked concrete evidence. He claimed that he was completely unaware of the atrocities. Tanaka also stated that he was being tried as a prisoner of war and did not wish to shirk responsibility, only seeking a fair trial according to law. Finally, the judge questioned the witnesses. The trial lasted twelve hours. The audience was crowded in front of the court.

<h3>The Netherlands Cannot Evade Responsibility for the Tanjung Priok Massacre of Overseas Chinese; Director He of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Speaks to Reporters; State of Emergency Declared Throughout Java</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference: the Dutch government, as the country involved in the Tanjung Priok incident in the Dutch East Indies where overseas Chinese were killed, cannot evade its responsibility. Among our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, there are one million people in areas controlled by the Indonesian authorities. The Indonesian authorities should also protect the safety of our overseas Chinese. Now, not only has protection not been provided, but killings have occurred. If this is not strictly stopped, it will not only arouse the resentment of our 450 million people but will also lose the world's sympathy for the Indonesian revolution. He also reported on our side's negotiations regarding the Dutch East Indies' killing of overseas Chinese. It is understood that our Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, requested the Allied Headquarters to send a military rescue team immediately after the incident to rescue them and also lodged a strong protest with Indonesian President Shari, hoping that the Allied authorities could at least provide weapons to the overseas Chinese to enable them to defend themselves. However, this suggestion has not been adopted by the Allied Headquarters. Jiang has been ordered to return to China and will arrive in Beijing in a few days to report the detailed situation of the massacre to the authorities. Also, Dutch East Indies National Congress representatives Wang Shangzhi, Wu Shenji, etc., in Beijing expressed great concern about this matter and have appealed to the relevant authorities, requesting the government to take effective measures to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 8th] President Sukarno of the self-proclaimed Republic of Indonesia announced today that the entire island of Java is in a state of emergency and broadcast this announcement to the entire country. This is a step taken after conflicts occurred between Indonesians and overseas Chinese in Batavia. According to a source from a certain Allied country yesterday: approximately six to seven hundred overseas Chinese were killed by Indonesians.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 7th] Four hundred overseas Chinese refugees escaped from Batavia to the Cirebon area west of here today. It is said that 2,000 overseas Chinese in that area have been completely surrounded by Indonesians. Although they have not yet attacked, their fate is worrying if they do not receive rescue. They risked their lives to escape and beg for help, and their families are still in the Cirebon area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 7th] Indonesian Minister of Information Natsir, accompanied by two staff members of the ministry, two staff members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, two Indonesian military officers, and three members of the Chinese and Indonesian Friendship Committee, went to Serang, forty miles west of Tanjung Priok, in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Tanjung Priok is now in a calm and proper state. Approximately 800 overseas Chinese were massacred. The death situation of 25,000 overseas Chinese west of the city is still unclear. According to the Chinese General Association, there are now 400 refugees. On three wooden boats, from Maduk, 20 kilometers northwest of Tanjung Priok, arrived in Batavia.</p>

The Wujiang and Qianjiang Rivers have been neglected for years, resulting in the accumulation of silt, which has also greatly affected navigation at the mouth of the Qianjiang River. The damage was even greater during the enemy and puppet period, so floods frequently occurred, and bridges and villages were extensively washed away. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will send personnel to conduct surveys in the coming days. Also, the Emergency Repair Committee of the Seawall Project, the Water Conservancy Committee of the Executive Yuan, has ordered the emergency repair to be changed to a permanent and regular repair committee.

<p>On May 30th, County Magistrate Huang convened the second meeting of the Military Grain Procurement Committee. Considering that the county was still short about 10,000 *shi* (石, a unit of dry volume measure) of military grain, the meeting discussed how to procure enough. Two resolutions were made: (1) The committee will order each district office to work with township and *bao* (保, a basic administrative unit) chiefs to investigate and identify households hoarding surplus rice and refusing to hand over military grain. The names will be submitted to the committee for arrest and double taxation. (2) According to the National Government's temporary regulations on punishing violations of food management during extraordinary times, anyone hoarding rice for more than three months' needs must report surplus grain to the food authority. Twenty percent of the confiscated surplus grain will be awarded as incentives to informants.

<p>Wujiang: County Party Headquarters Exposes Two Chinese Traitors</p>
<p>The Wujiang County Party Headquarters, after investigating Yang Yan-bin, who previously served as the county magistrate, and other secret agents and special agents who acted as accomplices for the enemy, wantonly abused their power under the enemy's protection, harmed the people. Villagers everywhere deeply hate them. Now, representing public opinion, the Party Headquarters has investigated and verified their crimes, compiled a list of over eighty names, and sent it to the Jiangsu High Court for investigation, arrest, and legal action. It is also rumored that Yang Ni Yan-bin, with his inherent barbarity, has recently gathered followers and become a bandit in Taihu Lake, calling himself the "Taihu County Magistrate" and assigning his cronies to serve as "district chiefs" in the Zhenze District along the lake shore.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Warehouse Chief Sells Firearms Privately</p>
<p>Gan Hua-pu, the warehouse chief of the 36th Warehouse of the Ministry of Military Administration stationed in Guangfu Town, was recently instigated by Sun Chao, an official of the town office, to privately sell 25 firearms at a price of 120,000 yuan per piece. Sun Chao sold 15 pieces to Dongzhu Town, and the remaining 10 pieces were purchased by Guangfu Town. This matter was discovered by the acceptance committee of the Ministry of Military Administration, who sent a letter to the Suzhou Military Police Corps at the beginning of the month, requesting assistance in the arrest. After receiving the news, the Military Police Corps dispatched a squad in an armored vehicle on the morning of the 4th of this month to make the arrest. Upon arrival, they apprehended Sun Chao, the official, as well as Gan Hua-pu, the warehouse chief, and two other suspected accomplices. All the firearms were confiscated. As the military police were about to board the vehicle and return to Suzhou, the captain of the local traffic police brigade arrived to stop them from proceeding, claiming that the town was under a certain person's security jurisdiction and that they had not been contacted beforehand. Therefore, the firearms had to be left behind. The military police, fearing an unnecessary conflict, recorded all the serial numbers of the firearms and obtained a receipt from the town office. They arrived in Suzhou at 9 PM and reported the incident to the corps.</p>
<p>Changshu: Joint Survey of the Boundary Between Changshu and Chengjiang</p>
<p>The villages of Feihua and Chaxu in Masi and Chenghang Townships of the Fourth District here are adjacent to Chengjiang. Previously, residents of these villages requested to be placed under the jurisdiction of Changshu, but the Jiangyin County Government did not agree, leading to a border dispute between the two counties. Subsequently, the Second District Commissioner sent personnel to survey the area and concluded that, based on geographical conditions, it should be incorporated into Changshu. Recently, Zhang Tong-fa, a provincial civil affairs supervisor from the Civil and Constitutional Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, came to Changshu and went to the area for a joint survey on the 7th.</p>

<p>Dangtu: Entire Evaluation Committee Resigns</p>
<p>The Changzhou branch of the Suzhou Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration has been established for over five months. Some enemy and puppet industries have entered the stage of valuation and sale. The valuation of the enemy and puppet industries being handled is determined by the Evaluation Committee, which is composed of the heads of various local agencies in the county or experts. Recently, all the committee members felt that the evaluation meetings were empty and meaningless. The valuation and sale of each enemy and puppet industry was decided in advance by the branch office and then submitted to the meeting for a formal approval. The task of the evaluation committee members was actually quite futile. On the 4th of this month, Jin Guo and all the other members of the Evaluation Committee jointly submitted their resignations to the branch office.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Continued Military Grain Levy and a Request to Substitute Wheat</p>
<p>The county government ordered the procurement of 20,000 *shi* of military grain. County Magistrate Fang immediately convened the district and township chiefs to scrape together 10,000 *shi*. For the remaining 10,000 *shi*, representatives were sent to the province by the County Council to request exemption, but the request was denied. With the transition period between harvests, it is difficult to continue collecting 10,000 *shi*. A telegram was sent to the province, requesting permission to follow Wuxi's example and allow 200 *jin* (斤, a unit of weight, about 500 grams) of wheat to be substituted for one *shi* of rice, in order to alleviate the people's hardship.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Only Thirteen Days Left!</h3>
<p>— Isn't the Ceasefire Just a Delaying Tactic?</p>
<p>The ceasefire order in Northeast China, which should have taken effect at noon on June 7th, makes these fifteen days a turning point for defusing the dangerous situation in Chinese politics. In an instant, two days have passed, and today we have only thirteen days left! However, the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi have no authority to negotiate. The day before yesterday, they had to fly to Yan'an for instructions, and it is still unknown whether they can return to Beijing today or tomorrow. Before leaving Beijing, Zhou and Lu told reporters: "Negotiations will inevitably involve political issues in the Northeast and even the whole country, which will require more time." This seems to suggest that the task of negotiation may not necessarily be completed within fifteen days, leaving room for a "delaying" policy in advance. Although the CCP representatives have outwardly tried their best to express their desire to "make the temporary ceasefire a long-term ceasefire," based on our painful past experiences, we still dare not feel too much affection or excessive excitement, because if the negotiating parties or any one party does not have the sincerity to transform hostility into detailed harmony, then the so-called "ceasefire" is very likely to turn into a "delaying tactic." We really need to beware of another "disappointment" after hope!</p>
<p>CCP leaders have recently been saying that they are willing to have an "unconditional ceasefire," but in fact, they have raised particularly many conditions; it is not surprising to have many conditions, as long as they are negotiated and counted, it is better than not raising conditions and not opening negotiations. Now that it is possible to have a ceasefire for fifteen days and reopen the door to negotiations, the people are happy, but the New China News Agency and Liberation Daily in Yan'an did not mention this matter at all in their editorials on the 7th, showing extreme indifference. This is strange. The Liberation Daily not only does not mention the "temporary ceasefire" that the CCP representatives claimed was achieved through "subjective efforts," showing disdain for this matter, but also severely criticizes the United States in the editorial for having "imperialist" ambitions of aggression and interference, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, and even falsely accusing that "the civil war in North China and Northeast China was actually caused by the United States transporting National Army and fire." It also insists that "one day, the United States will ask China for military bases, political and economic privileges, making China virtually a protectorate or colony of the United States." The purpose of this groundless malicious propaganda is unknown. In fact, the CCP representatives firmly opposed the arbitration power of Special Envoy Marshall in the peace negotiations, and then, on the day the Northeast ceasefire order was issued and took effect, the Liberation Daily vigorously attacked the United States, which was mediating in the middle. Even if the intention is not spoken through, discerning people should be able to understand it.</p>
<p>The United States was our ally during the war, which is well known to the world. Currently, the Japanese prisoners and residents in China have not been completely evacuated, and the task of China's receiving territory and sovereignty has not been completed. We can say that the US soldiers' combat mission in China has not been completely ended. The United States' assistance in transporting the National Army, reorganizing the National Army, and sending Japanese prisoners and residents back to their country is also an obligation of assistance that allies in the war of resistance should fulfill according to the agreement. The Chinese people cannot but express heartfelt admiration for the efforts of the US authorities and soldiers to safeguard victory and maintain peace, and at the same time, they all want to fulfill more responsibilities themselves, so as not to fail their allies. But the CCP insists on using "anti-American" rhetoric to incite the Chinese people's "anti-American" emotions, as if China is only allowed to be friends with the Soviet Union and is not allowed to have a second ally, which is extremely strange! The Chinese people, who are able to distinguish between good and bad friends, believe that they must have their own opinions. The CCP, on the one hand, relies on military strength to divide and occupy territory, and on the other hand, coerces negotiations. In the process of negotiation, it often hopes that the United States will act as a fair mediator. But if it does not get its way, it immediately refuses to recognize friends, refuses to allow Marshal Marshall to have arbitration power, and even falsely accuses the United States of wanting to make China a protectorate, thinking that by scolding in this way, American friends will definitely avoid suspicion and leave, and no longer come to dissuade our "civil war." The CCP's actions clearly seem to indicate that it does not expect any satisfactory results from the negotiations. We know that the three issues to be discussed during these fifteen days are: (1) detailed measures for a complete ceasefire in Northeast China; (2) detailed measures for complete restoration of transportation; (3) an agreement on obtaining a solid foundation and promptly implementing national military demobilization and reorganization. May I ask, "If the government and the CCP have differences of opinion on a certain issue, if there is no intermediary arbitrator to make the final decision," how can these negotiations have an ending? And how can it be satisfactory? Isn't this leading back to the old path of "one side insists on demanding, the other side refuses to compromise, and the result is only conflict" that the CCP representatives mentioned? If the CCP still adheres to this mentality and uses the method of opposing Marshal Marshall's arbitration power to deal with the negotiations during the ceasefire, then this fifteen-day ceasefire is very likely to become a "delaying tactic." This is the real intention behind the CCP newspapers' efforts to promote "anti-American" and even "hate-America" sentiments at this time. We only need to pay attention to how the rhetoric of the politicians who echo the CCP's self-proclaimed "democracy" is in the next few days, and we can "think more than half"!</p>
<p>But, in any case, we want to remind our compatriots: After China's victory in the War of Resistance, Outer Mongolia became independent, Lushun and Dalian became "shared by China and the Soviet Union," and the China-Changchun Railway also came under "joint management by China and the Soviet Union." The factories and mines in Northeast China have all been emptied by others. These are all iron facts after the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Alliance and Friendship Treaty"! China's sacrifices have nothing to do with the United States! What has the CCP said about these events? Who is the imperialist? We need to recognize this clearly!</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Agencies' Efforts to Reassure Are Ineffective; Zhejiang Civil Servants Take Mass Leave; Hubei Provincial Government Employees Also Request Re-Adjustment of Salaries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 8th Dispatch] The Zhejiang public education personnel's movement to demand improved salaries was ineffective despite the reassurances of the heads of various provincial agencies on the evening of the 7th. On the 8th, all the staff of other agencies and schools, except for the Provincial Government Secretariat, did not report to work and took mass leave for one day. It was also decided to formally establish the Zhejiang Public Education Personnel Demand for Improved Salaries Movement Committee at 3 PM on the 10th in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Participants include: Cooperative Supply and Marketing Office, Cooperative Business Management Office, Wuzhan Telegraph General Office, Provincial Transportation Management Office, Department of Construction, Zhejiang University, Department of Health, Provincial Anti-Japanese League, Jianguo Middle School, Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, Provincial Social Affairs Office, Provincial Land Administration Bureau, Department of Civil Affairs, Secretariat, Department of Education, Department of Finance, Zhejiang Branch of the Kuomintang Youth League, and the Municipal Bureau of Education.

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 8th Dispatch] Zhejiang Province spent the whole day yesterday being busy with the issue of adjusting the salaries of Zhejiang provincial civil servants. Lei Fazhang, the Secretary-General of Zhejiang Province, specially summoned the staff of the Secretariat on the 8th for earnest instruction, saying that the central government would definitely have appropriate measures, and analyzed the domestic and international situation for more than two hours. The listeners were very moved. The civil servants here are now waiting for Chairman Shen's reply telegram. The central agencies in Hangzhou City held a meeting yesterday to discuss the adjustment of salaries and resolved: "The urban area of this city is different from the provincial area of Zhejiang, and should be distinguished. Based on Hangzhou's price comparison and cost-of-living index, it should be reported to the central government that Hangzhou should be listed in the same first class as Beijing and Shanghai." All the central agencies in Hangzhou City have jointly requested the Central Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou 8th Dispatch] After the promulgation of the method for adjusting the salaries of civil servants, all the employees of the Hubei Provincial Government felt that the salary grade standard for civil servants here was placed in the fifth grade, with only tens of thousands of yuan to more than ten thousand yuan added per month, which was tantamount to not receiving any actual benefits. They jointly telegraphed President Song and Chairman Wan, who was attending the financial and food meeting in Beijing, stating the cost-of-living index and the actual suffering, and appealed to re-adjust according to the Beijing and Shanghai standards. Miao Peicheng, the Inspector of Hunan and Hubei, also telegraphed the Control Yuan to forward the application to the National Defense Committee, the general idea being the same as above.</p>
<h3>Wuxian Teachers Take Mass Leave</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 8th Dispatch] Currently, the salaries of more than 500 teachers in more than 40 county-level primary and secondary schools in this county consist of a living allowance of 24,000 yuan and a base salary increased by 140 times, and the difference is very large. The county-level teachers believe that although there are differences in name, the hard work is the same, so they sent representatives to the County Education Bureau to request leave on the 7th. Three requests were made: (1) maintain a balance with provincial-level salaries, (2) provide one *shi* of white rice without compensation, and (3) pre-loan two months' salary. As a result, the results were unsatisfactory, so they expressed their intention to take mass leave on the 8th, and the formal documents will be submitted to the Education Bureau on the 10th, and classes will be suspended immediately. The total number of primary and secondary school students in Suzhou is about 16,000. If the situation escalates, the future is deeply worrying and will spread to rural areas.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Spectacle: London Holds Victory Celebration Yesterday; Grand Parade of Allied Forces from Seventeen Nations; Throngs of People Cheering Wildly</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 8th - A broadcast from London reports: Twelve million people from all over the British Empire crowded into London to watch today's victory celebration. The grand parade of Allied forces from seventeen nations stretched for miles, filled with high spirits. The audience was wildly cheering, and the enthusiastic atmosphere was unseen since the coronation of the British monarch. The only disappointing thing was that the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not send troops to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The wounds of postwar London were covered today by bright red and golden flags. The flags were hung after careful arrangement, and the White House, where the government is located, looked like a small mountain made of flower baskets. On the day of the victory in Europe, London buildings were covered with Soviet flags, but today they are gone because the Soviet Union has refused to participate in this grand ceremony. The streets are crowded with people. The railway authorities opened 75 "victory special trains" to transport tourists from all over the country.</p>
<p>Military Parade</p>
<p>A total of 21,000 soldiers, 408 vehicles of various types, and 310 aircraft participated in the parade. The contingent of seventeen Allied countries was led by four American officers and seventy navy, army, and marine corps personnel. Twenty-four American airmen also flew in aircraft to join the Royal Air Force's soaring performance. British non-military personnel, even housewives, also sent representatives to participate in the parade. Fourteen Royal Navy warships also sailed into the Thames, which will be open for several days for people to visit. The King, Queen, and Princess will arrive at the reviewing stand on Mall Street in a royal four-wheeled carriage before 11:30 a.m. to review the victorious troops from various countries. Military and political leaders of the British Commonwealth will arrive in two batches, led by Attlee and Churchill in the same royal carriage. The parade is expected to last until 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Moving Night Scene</p>
<p>Most of the afternoon will be filled with dance parties and concerts. The most moving scene will be the lighting and searchlight performances in the evening. At the same time, firecrackers and fireworks will be set off in front of the Houses of Parliament. There will also be 800 fountains spraying water into the air in the Thames. The Royal Air Force will also ascend into the air under the illumination of 80 searchlights. The celebration ceremony will officially end at midnight.</p>
<p>Sleeping on the Streets</p>
<p>Tonight, people have already gathered near St. James's Park. Most of the spectators, wanting to secure a spot in the front row, have camped out on the streets overnight, bringing record players, radios, and playing cards to pass the long night. The government began preparing for this grand ceremony in January of this year, spending as much as £100,000 on decorations.</p>

Former Minister of Information Bracken took the floor and replied: Foreign journalists in Britain enjoy full freedom in their work.

<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 7th] According to German diplomatic files seized by the United Nations, Hitler and Mussolini, having suffered the pain of defeat in Stalingrad and Tripoli, unanimously believed in 1943 that Franco's failure to keep his promise to attack Gibraltar had caused a serious blow to the Axis powers. To make up for Franco's breach of faith, Hitler attempted to urge him to guarantee that he would resist the landing of Anglo-American forces on the Iberian Peninsula and invade Portugal. Franco's collusion with the Axis Powers during the war is seen in the four-hour meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop held at the Venice Palace in Rome on February 25, 1943. After the failure of the 1943 plan to invade Gibraltar, Ribbentrop declared: "Franco, who was deeply trusted by the German and Italian leaders, abandoned Germany and Italy in times of crisis." Mussolini replied: "Franco's policy is nothing more than duplicity." The official German Foreign Ministry memorandum recorded the conversation between the two as follows: "The German Foreign Ministry informed Mussolini of the recently concluded secret treaty. Spain hopes to obtain military supplies from Germany. The German leader, in view of Franco's attitude, only agreed that Spain would prepare to defend with all its strength when the British and Americans landed on the Iberian Peninsula and on the islands of Spain in the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. If the British landed in Portugal, Franco should immediately invade Portugal. The German Foreign Minister asked the Italian Prime Minister to keep this news strictly confidential, so as not to make Franco unhappy after it was made public. In addition, there is another secret treaty with Spain regarding participation in the 'Steel Pact,' which is also kept secret. In general, if the British army lands in Portugal, it will be beneficial to the Axis powers, and Franco will join the Axis side to fight at that time, and the Axis side will be able to obtain a large number of reinforcements. And German divisions will also enter Spain to help defend against the British and American landings. The Italian Prime Minister pointed to Franco's previous attitude, saying that he missed the great opportunity to attack Gibraltar, which caused the failure of the German plan. The German Foreign Minister mentioned that if this incident (Franco's breach of faith) had not occurred, the British and Americans would not have landed in North Africa."</p>
<p>Mussolini, troubled by the failure in Tripolitania and fearing an Allied invasion of the Italian mainland, told Ribbentrop that Spain's participation in the war "should be realized in a favorable period, otherwise Spain's participation in the war would only increase the burden. Ribbentrop told the Italian Prime Minister that Franco would not completely abandon the Axis powers and attack the German army with German weapons in the future, and that this would be tantamount to suicide. The Italian Prime Minister also believed that "the enemy's victory is equal to Franco's doomsday."</p>

<p>[United Press, Seattle, 7th] The World Seafarers' Conference opened here on the 6th and will last for 21 days.

<h3>Stolen Treasures Recovered from German Ancient Palace; US Colonel and Wife Detained</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Regarding the case of the stolen treasures worth US$1.5 million from the Kronberg Palace near Frankfurt, Germany, the Department of the Army announced today that it has placed an army women's auxiliary corps captain and her husband, a colonel, under supervision. This jewelry was hidden in the basement of the ancient palace several years ago. The palace was taken over by the US military authorities and used as a US Army officers' club. About seven months ago, someone dug through the paved concrete and took out the boxes containing the jewelry. The owner of the ancient palace is Countess Hudson of Hesse, granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England, and is 74 years old. According to her report, the Hess family was assured by the US military last year that the jewelry was safe in the hands of the US military. Later, after inquiries from the Hess family, the US military confirmed that the jewelry had been handed over to the military authorities in Frankfurt for safekeeping. When the Duchess of Sophie requested its return two months ago, it was no longer available. It is reported that the stolen jewelry and other treasures, such as ancient Bibles, have been recovered. In addition to those currently detained, there are two others involved in the case, one a serving major and the other a retired sergeant. Miller detailed the course of this mysterious case as follows: In 1944, Germany suffered intense air raids. The Hess royal family was convinced that it was safer to take these family heirlooms out of the bank and hide them in the ancient palace. In October of that year, the Hess family held a meeting, inventoried all the treasures, compiled a catalog, and then packed them, took a general worker, and went to the basement of the palace together. They chose a remote place, first put the treasures in a lead box, added a sturdy wooden box on the outside, and buried it in the cellar. Later, the worker put the key in place, re-paved the ground, and at the same time hid 1,600 bottles of aged wine in the cellar.</p>

<h3>Guilt and Merit Cannot Offset Each Other; All Property Confiscated; Li Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment; Defendant Lowered His Head and Said "Good!" Upon Hearing the Verdict! Sun Yunzhang and Lao Yinyu Sentenced to Ten Years and Seven Years Respectively</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational Li Ze case in Shanghai was pronounced yesterday afternoon. The audience seats in the First Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court in Tilanqiao were completely filled. By 2:30 PM, the courtroom was packed. At 2:45 PM, Judge Liu, along with Judge Qiu Cao and Prosecutor Dai, took their seats. First, Sun Yunzhang and Lao Yinyu were called to be sentenced. The two traitors colluded with an enemy country and plotted to resist our nation. The former was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years, while the latter was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years. All their property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of their families, was confiscated. Next, Li Ze was brought in, escorted by bailiffs through the crowd into the courtroom. He was wearing a lotus-colored Indian silk long gown and yellow leather shoes. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Li Ze, colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist our nation, is sentenced to three years imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for three years, and all his property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for his family's living expenses, is confiscated." Everyone held their breath to listen to the verdict. Some had satisfied smiles on their faces, some seemed a little sad, and some had stern faces, expressing disagreement. However, Li Ze's attitude was very calm. He only nodded slightly and softly said one word: "Good!" Then he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs. The severity of this sentence has been met with varying criticisms from all walks of life. The accusers felt it was too lenient, while some thought it was too harsh. But some also said: "This case was judged very appropriately." The reasoning section of the full text of the judgment is recorded below. (See lower left corner)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Nephew, Chen Chunpu, Shamelessly Boasted of His Merits and Was Rebuked in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Chunpu, who followed Wang Jingwei in engaging in "peaceful national salvation," was tried yesterday by the High Court, presided over by the court president. Chen, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, is 47 years old and a relative of Wang Jingwei. He once held important positions in party and government organs. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang Jingwei betrayed the country. Chen, at his instigation, first left Chongqing to organize a puppet government, serving as Wang Jingwei's personal secretary, and successively held positions such as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of the puppet government, Deputy Secretary-General of the Political Committee, Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters, Governor of Guangdong Province, concurrently Director of Pacification of the province, Commander of the Security Forces, and member of the National Government of the puppet regime. He willingly allowed himself to be used by the enemy in the hope of achieving his goal of betraying the country for personal glory. The High Prosecutor's Office considered Chen to be Wang Jingwei's confidant, colluding with each other, colluding with the enemy country, plotting to resist our country, and his treacherous acts were extremely obvious. Therefore, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. During the interrogation yesterday afternoon, Chen wore a blue silk gown and black cloth shoes. He was thin and tall with slightly white hair, but his spirit was still good. He claimed to have graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in 1927 and was a nephew of "Mrs. Wang." From 1934 onwards, he had been following Wang Jingwei. His departure from Chongqing was because he wanted to send Wang's children to Hong Kong for schooling, and the "Yan telegram" appeared in the newspapers without his prior knowledge. The puppet positions he held were either nominal or for doing practical work. He did not participate in any diplomatic activities, so he could not be held responsible for the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty." Then he shamelessly boasted of his merits, saying that during his tenure as the puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, he eradicated opium seedlings, strictly prohibited opium, and also organized charitable activities, which were beneficial to the people. Judge Xiao immediately rebuked him, saying, "How can these petty merits cover up your great faults?" He then adjourned the hearing for another day.</p>
<p>The Shen Guanquan Case Was Also Tried Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition, Judge Yang Ding and Clerk Li Jinzhang interrogated Shen Guanquan (a native of Shanghai, 42 years old), the acting warden of the puppet Shanghai Prison, yesterday afternoon. He had colluded with the "Assistant Warden" Iimura Akira and Miura Masuo, appointed by the enemy's military police, to send more than 1,200 prisoners to the Zhoushan Islands and Sijiao Mountain area to do military engineering work for the enemy, resulting in the deaths of more than eighty people. He also colluded with Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section, Shen Guanrong (his younger brother), the deputy head, and Zhang Xumei, etc., to sell 44 bundles of gray felt and white paper and other goods for their own personal gain. Shen sophistically defended himself in court, pushing all responsibility onto the Japanese. As for the private sale of materials, he claimed it was for office expenses. In addition, the cases of the Russian Valimaski, and Wen Shisong, Zhao Xilin, Zhu Chizi, etc., were interrogated yesterday and all were adjourned for another day.</p>
<p>Wang Yongkang and Others Scheduled for Sentencing</p>
<p>[Another Report] The case of "gambling den boss" Wang Yongkang and Yuan Jufan, Zhu Duanlin, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Chief, was concluded yesterday afternoon, and the sentencing is scheduled for 2 PM on the 15th of this month. The case of Zhang Qipin, suspected of being a traitor, will be sentenced at 9:30 AM on the 14th.</p>

<h3>Principles Decided for the Repatriation of German Nationals</h3>
<p>The issue of repatriating German nationals has been brewing for some time without a clear resolution. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously sent a special commissioner to Beijing for instructions, who returned to Shanghai the night before last to report. It is understood that there are three principles: (1) The list of repatriated persons previously determined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to need to be reconsidered. (2) The date for the repatriation of German nationals, originally scheduled for the 15th of this month, has now been ordered to be extended to the end of June, giving German nationals more opportunity to decide whether to stay or leave. (3) In the future, for those designated German nationals who are to be repatriated, if their parents (who are not on the repatriation list) wish to return to their home country with their children at the same time because they are old and have no one to care for them, they can apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the relevant authorities will consider it to find a perfect solution. Regarding the repatriation of German nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to express more opinions, while most German nationals hope to stay in China.</p>
<p>Another Report: The first batch of more than 900 German nationals will be repatriated soon. Each person can take 250 pounds of luggage, 32 pounds of carry-on items, and 1,000 marks, equivalent to 100 US dollars. In addition, 50 US dollars will be used as expenses on the ship.</p>
<h3>A Multitude of Vehicles Outside Song Park to Reverently Worship the Martyrs at the Tomb of Song Jiaoren; Presidents Yu and Tan of the Two Academies Recalled Past Events Vividly; He Was the First Person to Shed Blood for the Constitution</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Song Park in Zhabei, which has been desolate for nine years, suddenly saw a multitude of vehicles yesterday morning. At 9:00 AM sharp, President Yu of the Control Yuan and Vice President Tan of the Legislative Yuan, along with Mr. Shen Gongzhan, Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo from the city's press, Director Gan Zukang of the Municipal Works Bureau, Supervisor Yan Zhuang and more than 30 others, reverently worshiped the revolutionary martyrs. The press elders were responsible for the management of the ceremony, which ended around noon.</p>
<p>Weeds and Desolation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the participants arrived, they first inspected the park. Weeds were everywhere and it was extremely desolate. Only the statue of Martyr Song was still intact. The inscription on the stele in front of the statue was written in cursive script by Zhang Taiyan: "Fisherman." "Fisherman" was Martyr Song's courtesy name. The inscription on the back of the stele was written by Yu Youren and calligraphed by Kang Baozhong. The text read: "The world mourns Mr.'s death, the world knows Mr.'s deeds, so why should I record them? To write the truth? The truth slays people! To write falsehoods? Falsehoods are condemned by heaven! Alas, the tears of the nine springs, the blood of the world, the pen of an old friend, the iron of the traitors. Engrave it on the empty mountains, entrust it to honest historians, inscribe it on our hearts, and attest it to heaven and earth!" Song's spirit can be passed down, and President Yu's grief and indignation on that day can be imagined.</p>
<p>Recalling Past Events</p>
<p>Then they went to the front of Song's tomb, where Presidents Yu and Tan and the Journalists Association presented wreaths, performed the most respectful salute, and stood silently for a long time, before moving to pay respects at the tomb of Song's wife, Madame Fang. After the ceremony, Presidents Yu and Tan took a short rest on the walkway in front of the tomb, and the scorching sun made them sweat profusely. President Yu then recounted Song's past deeds, taking short breaks from time to time due to a slight asthma. Mr. Tan said: During the Nanjing government in the first year of the Republic, the people of the country wanted peace and unity after the overthrow of the Manchus. So, they improvised and gave the presidency to Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai). For the sake of solidifying the foundation of the Republic, Song formulated a constitution, wanting to use the constitution as a guarantee for the Republic. At that time, our party recognized democratic politics as the foundation of governing the country, without any doubt. Unexpectedly, today some people are still demanding democracy, which shows that they do not understand the spirit of our party and can be considered an insult to our party. If Song Yu Fu (Song Jiaoren) were alive today, he would have been able to lay the foundation for the country, such as education and transportation, within the first three years of the Republic. Unexpectedly, he was resented by Yuan Shikai, who assassinated him by despicable means, and he died with unfulfilled ambitions, which caused grief to the entire country. Song was the first person to shed blood for the constitution. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen's eulogy said: "Who is not an old survivor in protecting civil rights?" "He was the first person to shed blood for the constitution!" During the constitutional protection movement in the seventh year of the Republic, Yu Yuan's uprising in Sanyuan was also based on "law" as the foundation of the Republic.</p>
<p>Seeking Benevolence and Obtaining Benevolence</p>
<p>President Yu Gang stood up and said: On the day of Song's assassination, Chen Qimei, Huang Xing, and Yu Min himself were all present. When the gunshot rang, they thought Mr. Chen Qimei had been sniped, but later they saw it was Mr. Song, and they helped him into the railway hospital. But it was too late, there was no one in the hospital, and soon it was dawn. So they helped Martyr Song up to the third floor, but the blood flow was too great and his condition worsened, and he eventually died. At that time, the murderer, Wu Shiying, Ying Guixin, Zhao Bingjun, and Hong Shuzu had all passed away. But Hong actually escaped after the incident, and was later sued in Qingdao by a German, which was obtained by Mr. Song Jiaoren's son Zhenlv (who is now also deceased), and was eventually escorted to Beijing and executed by hanging. Song's descendants now only have Zhenlv's daughter.</p>
<h3>Huge Embezzlement Case at the Bank of China; Principal Culprit Not Yet Captured; Ministry of Finance Thoroughly Investigates Chongqing Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Yuancheng, the main culprit in the huge embezzlement case at the Central Bank, was previously reported to have been arrested in Ningbo. According to a second telegram received last night by the Huangpu Branch Bureau, which is handling the case, from the Sixth District Commissioner's Office in Zhenhai, the person captured earlier was actually Chen Yuancheng's brother, Chen Yuanjun, not Chen Yuancheng himself. Therefore, the main culprit in this huge embezzlement case is still at large. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the case involving the Chongqing Bank's gold bullion mortgage and has formally ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Production Conference; Industrial Circles Exchange Views; Hoping to Obtain a Plan to Find Solutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the eve of the Production Conference, the General Trade Union gathered the heads of various industry trade unions a few days ago to hold a symposium to exchange views and prepare proposals. At 2 PM yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Branch of the China National Industries Association convened a joint meeting of various industrial trade associations at No. 431 Nanchang Road. More than 50 representatives from more than 30 industrial trade associations attended, chaired by Mr. Hu Boxiang. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, also attended. First, the chairman elaborated on the significance of the meeting, saying: "With the Production Conference imminent, members and factories of various associations have written to the association to express their opinions. Today, we have convened the entire group for a comprehensive discussion, hoping to obtain concrete proposals that can be presented at the Production Conference to seek solutions to save the industrial crisis." Then, representatives from various industries presented their opinions and had heated discussions. Good opinions were expressed on issues such as adjusting taxes, supplying raw materials, encouraging exports and investing in production, formulating industrial policies, restricting the supply of foreign exchange, raising import tariffs on manufactured goods, and requesting industrial loans. Everyone agreed to ask the General Office for instructions. They also requested Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zheng and others to attend the Production Conference. Finally, Director Gu of the Social Affairs Bureau gave a detailed explanation of the upcoming Production Conference, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Dai Yingfu Interrogated for Instilling Enslavement Education</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Dai Yingfu (Tianpeng), the puppet Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Chief, suspected of being a traitor, was also tried yesterday morning. Dai, a native of Danyang, is 49 years old and graduated from China Public School. He served as a professor at Shanghai College of Politics and Law and other schools. In June 1939, he defected to the puppet regime and served as the chairman of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Education Movement Committee, Standing Committee member of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, representative of the Puppet Sixth National Congress, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Puppet Kuomintang, Puppet Ministry of Education official, counselor of the Puppet National Government, Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet New National Movement Committee, and Puppet Shanghai Education Bureau Chief. He took "peace, anti-communism, and national construction" as the education's purpose. He forced middle schools and above to require Japanese language. As the head of the delegation, he attended the "Greater East Asia Education Conference" in Tokyo and Changchun, Manchuria. He did not leave his post until after the victory. At the beginning of the trial, Dai still quibbled, denied the crime, and claimed that he had not harmed the country or the people.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Construction of the Pudong Seawall Begins</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Pudong Seawall construction project, after a month of preparation and planning by the Municipal Works Bureau, has been allocated 100 million yuan for preparatory expenses and 400 million yuan for the first phase of construction by the Municipal Government. Construction has now begun.

The Municipal Government has already paid the first installment. It is reported that the second phase of funding has also been approved.

<h3>Four Junior Staff Members of the China Trade Bank; Illegally Established a Company and Failed in Speculation; Lost 500 Million Yuan; Poor Turnover, Indiscriminate Issuance of Bad Checks; Friend Ning Exposed the Failure, Three Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Four staff members of the China Trade Bank at No. 93 Guangdong Road, Sichuan Road, Qiu Xinran, Yu Zhengping, Zhang Mengjun, and Hu Muqing, took advantage of the location and telephone number of the China Trade Bank to illegally establish Jian Yuan Company two months ago, specializing in various speculative businesses, deceiving general customers. They ultimately failed in speculation, losing up to 500 million yuan in one month. Many outsiders were unaware and were foolishly deceived. It was not until the day before yesterday that Wei Junxian, manager of You Ning Company, first exposed the crime. Wei received a check for 20 million yuan from Jian Yuan Company, and the check was returned. The drawers all avoided and refused to be seen. Therefore, he reported the crime of issuing bad checks to the Huangpu Police Bureau, and the whole case was exposed. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched Criminal Division Chief Zhou Guanghui, Inspector Yao Hongzhang, police officers Han Zhichen, and Zhao Jiake to investigate separately. They first arrested Qiu Xinran at No. 12, Lane 77, Guizhou Road, and then arrested the two criminals Yu Zhengping and Hu Muqing at the Dadong Hotel No. 502 and the Garden Hotel No. 349. Only Zhang Mengjun was at large. They confessed to illegally establishing a company, failing in speculation, losing 500 million yuan, and issuing bad checks due to poor turnover. It was confirmed that Qiu Xinran's father is currently employed at the Bank of China, and his grandfather was the director of the cashier department. His uncle, Shao Jiamei, is the director of the cashier department of the China Trade Bank. Police officers confiscated a diamond ring, three watches, and 3,500 shares of May Asia stocks, with a total value of 30 million yuan, from Shao Jiamei's residence. This large-scale fraud case of illegally establishing a company and defrauding 500 million yuan was solved in just 30 hours thanks to the efforts of the police officers. However, the number of people scammed is definitely not just Wei Junxian alone, so the bureau is still investigating and summoning other victims to the case for joint handling.</p>

<h3>Assassination: Young Woman Living Alone Found Dead in Her Room</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Huang, a young woman from Guangdong, aged 27, lived alone in a garret room on the third floor of No. 10 Pu Bai Fang, Chong Qing Nan Lu. Her husband, Chen Zhenyuan, was a silversmith. They had a son, just one year old. Chen left Shanghai for Guangdong about twenty days ago, leaving only the mother and son in Shanghai. Around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chen was found stabbed to death in her room, her body lying across the floor. The knife wound in her throat was very deep, and there were also wounds on both temples. The discovery was made by the second landlord, who reported it to the Lujiawan Police Substation. After police investigation, two suicide notes were found on the table, generally stating that she was forced to take this drastic measure due to economic hardship. The body was then transported to Tongren Fuyuantang. During the coroner's examination, her cousin, Huang Bingzhong (who works at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company), arrived and stated that although his cousin was not wealthy, she was reasonably well-off and would never commit suicide due to financial problems. He suspected there might be hidden circumstances and that she was assassinated. Subsequent forensic evidence confirmed that the woman's throat had been stabbed, followed by knife wounds to both temples. A rigorous search is now underway to apprehend the culprit and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Jiang He Ship Runs Aground and Sinks: Passengers and Crew Are All Safe</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang He steamer (formerly named Emei), which sails on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, ran aground at 8:30 AM on the 7th of this month, while carrying cargo downstream from Chongqing on the 5th. The accident occurred in the Laoshu Tu river section, 48 li from Yichang. The bottom of the ship was punctured, and it immediately began to sink. According to a telegram from the Hankou branch office yesterday: the ship is partially submerged, with the bow still above water. All crew and passengers are safe.

<h3>Future Transportation: Increased Motor Vehicles Will Overwhelm Rickshaws</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau, the current traffic chaos is due to narrow roads and the fact that there are more rickshaws than motor vehicles. Regarding ways to improve the situation, it is not intended to impose passive restrictions on rickshaws, but to focus on active remedies. It is reported that someone has applied to the Municipal Government to manufacture special motorized tricycles, but this will require expert evaluation before a decision is made. Furthermore, Xiang Sheng Motor Company is currently applying to the Municipal Government to use "Cheng Che" (i.e., small, automatically timed taxis that can be hailed anywhere along the route). If such vehicles can be supplied in large quantities, rickshaws will naturally be eliminated.</p>

<h3>Radio Station: "The Setting Sun Is Infinitely Beautiful, Only It's Near Dusk"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Rumors are circulating that the first batch of over thirty radio stations in this city will be ordered to cease operations. When a reporter inquired about this matter with Mr. Zhang Chengxu, an engineer at the Telecommunications Bureau, he said that he had not yet received any instructions from the Ministry of Communications regarding this matter, so he could not confirm the rumors. He stated that according to the Ministry of Communications' regulations on the management of radio stations, only ten broadcast stations should be established in this city. Therefore, the current number of stations far exceeds the regulations, and a reduction is inevitable. However, the exact number of stations to be reduced will be determined by the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<h3>Grounds for Judgment in the Li Ze Case</h3>
<p>(Grounds) The defendant Li Ze, in the pseudo-Nanjing government's pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association, initially served as a preparatory committee member, and later as a director. He not only repeatedly confessed to this without denial, but there are also records in the submitted "New China Handbook" and "Continental Yearbook" that can be verified. During his term in the pseudo-position, he attended several joint meetings of pseudo-directors and supervisors. In addition to discussing association affairs, he also discussed and resolved plans for controlling materials, which were issued to various subordinate control committees for execution. This has also not been denied by him. Furthermore, the retrieval of Tang Shoumin's traitor case files and the minutes of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association's joint meetings of directors and supervisors can be used as evidence, making the facts extremely clear. The defendant's defenses were nothing more than: (1) Crime is judged by action, and title is not action. The defendant only held the title of an ordinary director of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association, but had no act of conspiring with the enemy or resisting this country. According to Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan, a mere title is not sufficient to convict a person. (2) The pseudo-Commercial Control Association adopted a system of centralized power in the chairman, and the control work of each department was borne by the respective control committees. The defendant was neither the chairman nor a managing director, nor a member of any control committee, but only one of the ordinary directors. All matters discussed by the board of directors were only minor personnel issues, not involving the actual control of materials. (3) The defendant's appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was at the instigation of the pseudo-regime. Prior consent was not required, and subsequent refusal was impossible. If he were to leave his post, the company would inevitably be destroyed and the personnel would be killed. Therefore, he silently endured the disgrace in order to preserve the life and property of the company. The pseudo-Commercial Control Association was not created by the defendant alone, and the directorship was not monopolized by him. If the defendant were to be prosecuted because of denunciation, while other directors were spared because no one questioned them, the injustice of the world would surely exceed this.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point of defense above:</p>
<p>It is found that the wartime economic policy outline promulgated by the pseudo-Nanjing government first revealed that the National Government (referring to the pseudo-regime) formulated the wartime economic policy outline in order to ensure the needs of the front during the war (excerpt omitted). Section A, Item 5, states that all existing economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime economic system should be adjusted. Also, the provisional regulations of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association state that the purpose of the National Commercial Control General Association is to assist the government (referring to the pseudo-government) in implementing national policies and to handle the procurement of controlled materials and military supplies under the order of the Ministry of Industry and other competent departments. Furthermore, the "Joint Declaration Between China and Japan" signed by the enemy and the pseudo-regime states that the two countries will fully cooperate in military, political, and economic affairs with unwavering determination and conviction. Therefore, the establishment of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association was mainly aimed at supplying the enemy's military needs, making it a clear economic organization that conspired with the enemy. The defendant's participation in this enemy-conspiring organization clearly showed a connection in intent. The resolutions of the joint meetings of the association's directors and supervisors were the expression of the general intention of all directors and supervisors. Upon examining their content, they were all beneficial to the enemy and the pseudo-regime and detrimental to this country. Since the defendant repeatedly attended and participated in the voting on the proposals, he was naturally acting against this country. This is in line with the condition of having criminal acts, as stated in Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan. How can he use this to evade responsibility for his crimes?</p>
<p>Regarding the defendant's second point of defense:</p>
<p>This court has reviewed the minutes of the joint meetings of directors and supervisors of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association. The resolutions of each meeting contain detailed records of the selection of personnel, plans, evaluation, procurement, and movement of controlled materials ("as seen in the meeting minutes of March 16, April 16, May 19, June 16, and October 20, in the resolutions column"). They were not merely minor personnel matters. Although the defendant was not the chairman or managing director of the pseudo-association, he participated in the resolutions in his capacity as a director and was therefore responsible for a portion of the criminal work and should bear corresponding responsibility. Whether the position he held was of a major importance is a matter of sentencing, not related to the establishment of the crime.</p>
<p>Regarding the defendant's third point of defense:</p>
<p>It is found that the defendant's appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was by designation, without coercion or violence. The defendant had the freedom to choose whether to accept or decline. It is unreasonable to say that the integrity of one manager could endanger the lives of the company's employees. As for the claim that he submitted to the pseudo-regime to protect the company's assets, the protection of assets is not a sufficient reason to be exempt from the crime of submission to the pseudo-regime. Moreover, at that time in Shanghai, there were many large stores that continued to operate without collaborating with the enemy. The claim that he submitted to the pseudo-regime in order to protect assets is clearly a pretext. Even if the defendant's initial submission to the pseudo-regime was due to coercion, he continued to hold the pseudo-position for two years. There were opportunities to hide in the interim. Why did he not leave at all? The so-called impossibility of refusal is nothing more than sophistry.</p>
<p>Regarding the defendant's fourth point of defense:</p>
<p>Those who commit a crime together each bear their own criminal responsibility and cannot seek exemption from prosecution on the grounds that other accomplices have not yet been denounced. Moreover, there are already many cases in which accomplices have been successively denounced and tried, so this cannot be used as an excuse to evade guilt. In summary, the defendant served as a director of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association and participated in the voting on proposals for the control of materials. These proposals were then transferred to various pseudo-control committees for separate implementation. This constituted an act that was beneficial to the enemy and detrimental to this country, constituting the crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot resistance against this country. However, it is found that his appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was due to his existing commercial status, which is different from those who voluntarily submitted to the pseudo-regime. He also responded to the instigation of the central government's personnel and donated a large sum of money (to prepare for the Allied forces' landing) and raised funds to support the loyal and patriotic army in the Pudong district, as evidenced by a letter from the Shanghai office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. It is understandable that his heart was not entirely malicious. Also, the pseudo-position he held was not a principal position.</p>
<p>Therefore, he is sentenced according to the scope of the statutory penalty in Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, after considering the circumstances. All of his property will be confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family. As for the allegation in the indictment that the defendant delivered Stinton iron pipes from the New New Company to the enemy army, which were transported away by military trucks, according to his defense, the sale of these pipes was arranged by Jin Zongcheng, the chairman of the company. He introduced Chuan Jihe, the factory manager of the Senda Iron Factory on Yongnian Street in this city, who contacted the defendant and agreed to purchase them. From September 18 to 20, 1944, Senda Iron Factory borrowed a charcoal truck from Rongfeng Yarn Factory, driven by driver Chen Hongen, to transport the pipes from New New Company. Huang Zhenguang, the company's general affairs director, was present at the scene, and He Jialiang, the head of the inventory department, weighed the pipes. Fei Wanzhi, an employee of Senda Iron Factory, supervised the weighing. The total weight was 369 zu 70 and a half jin, and the price was 2,070,348 pseudo-currency, which was paid in three installments. Two of the installments were immediate allocation slips issued by the Shanghai Industrial Bank of the pseudo-Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve, each with a face value of 250,000 pseudo-currency. Another installment was a similar allocation slip issued by the same bank, with a face value of 625,000 pseudo-currency. The last installment was an immediate promissory note issued by the Anfu Exchange Office, with a face value of 100 pseudo-currency. All of these were deposited into the New Da Bank account of New New Company. Because the payment exceeded the price of the goods by 54,652 pseudo-currency, New New Company issued a check for this amount on New Da Bank and returned it to Senda Iron Factory, which deposited it into Shanghai Enterprise Bank. The check was then endorsed by this bank and collected from New Da Bank through the pseudo-bank clearing house, and the payment was still made by this bank from the New New Company's account.</p>
<p>The defendant's claims are not without basis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the indictment's claim that there was a restriction on the movement of metals at that time, the defendant presented counter-evidence: (1) advertisements published in newspapers at that time openly soliciting the sale of ironware, (2) account books and receipts from Senda Iron Factory simultaneously purchasing pig iron from other businesses, (3) a letter from the pseudo-Commercial Control Association to the pseudo-Shanghai court, to prove that ironware was still movable within the city at that time. As for the accusers Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Ye Qiubin, and Yao Zhuoba, although they all claimed to have witnessed the pipes being transported away by enemy troops in trucks, these were all empty attacks and they did not provide any factual evidence sufficient to overturn the various counter-evidences presented by the defendant. Therefore, it is not appropriate to hastily punish him for the crime of supplying military raw materials and should be dismissed from consideration. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Regulations, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Paragraph 2 of the same article, Article 3, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 3, Paragraph 1 and Article 66 of the Criminal Law, the preceding paragraph of Article 37, Paragraph 2, judgment is hereby rendered as in the main text. This case was executed by Prosecutor Dai Rongduo in court on June 8, 1946, the Criminal Court of the Shanghai High Court, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, Judges Cao Jun, Qiu Huanying.</p>

<h3>National College of Social Education: Teachers and Students Arrive in Suzhou One After Another</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National College of Social Education was moved to Nanjing Lou Lingshan.

<h3>Jiangsu Educational Alumni Association Petitions for Promotion of Social Education</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Jiangsu Educational Alumni Association, recognizing the importance of promoting social education, has specifically expressed its opinions and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council for review, requesting the Provincial Government to earnestly implement it. The full text is as follows: (omitted above) Social education in our Jiangsu province has historically been renowned for its longevity and its effectiveness has consistently surpassed other provinces. Since the post-war recovery, with the active planning of the Department of Education, the original institutions have gradually been restored. However, due to financial constraints, many projects still cannot be launched. The provincial and county social education organizations are either still in the planning stages of restoration, or their funding is excessively limited, with a vast disparity between the reality and the ideal. Now, on the occasion of this esteemed council holding a general meeting, we specifically present the following opinions: (1) Broadly raise social education funds from a long-term perspective, (2) actively cultivate social education professionals, (3) prioritize enriching the content of already restored provincial-level social education institutions, (4) establish a timetable for the restoration of county and city social education organizations, and a standard for the allocation of county and city education funds, ordering the relevant county and city administrative education departments to earnestly comply. After your esteemed council reviews and approves this, we request that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government, ordering the Departments of Education and Finance to earnestly proceed, in order to promote social education.</p>
<h3>Five-Year Plan for Educational Films, Educational Film Studio to Move to Beijing, Central Educational Film Library Planned, Using Films to Teach Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Special Dispatch] In order to actively promote educational films, the Ministry of Education established an educational film studio in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, appointing Li Qingsong as director to oversee its operations. During the post-war recovery, the Ministry of Education planned to move the film studio to Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, leveraging the scenic area and large crowds to implement social education. Negotiations with the municipal government have been ongoing for a long time, but have not yet been resolved. We recently spoke with Director Li Qingsong and learned:</p>
<p>Studio Location</p>
<p>The municipal government explained that the Xuanwu Lake area has a mausoleum management office that has been operating there for a long time, making it difficult to immediately relocate. It is now proposed to use the land and buildings of the Luyun Flower Garden in Dingjiaqiao for the educational film studio and negotiations are underway.</p>
<p>Film Production</p>
<p>Since 1942, forty-eight educational films have been produced, with seventeen copies brought to Beijing. The educational films currently screened weekly in primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin include materials from this studio.</p>
<p>Original Plan</p>
<p>Previously, there was a five-year plan to establish a Central Educational Film Library, collecting films from various European and American countries for selection and research. Those relating to natural sciences would be utilized directly, while those relating to social sciences would be adapted and produced. The plan aimed to coordinate with all the teaching materials needed within the primary and secondary school curriculum, hoping to complete 1,500 films within five years for use in teaching, supplementing universal education, and alleviating the shortage of teaching staff.</p>
<p>Agricultural Education Films</p>
<p>Currently, the studio is also working closely with agricultural education films, as the Farmers Bank has a plan to promote rural agricultural education films, which is already being prepared. The committee in charge of guiding educational films is chaired by individuals such as Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, and Pan Gongzhan. Educational films for both urban and rural areas are advancing in parallel, supplementing school education and promoting social education equally. Director Li is awaiting an opportunity to fly to Chongqing to prepare for the relocation of the studio to Beijing. (One)</p>

<p>[Another News] Representatives of graduates from vocational schools and above in the recovered areas went to the Beiping Provisional University remedial classes a few days ago to meet with Director Chen Xueping, stating the alumni association's secondary resolution against the screening. Director Chen stated that he hoped the alumni would understand the government's difficulties and come forward to register and accept the screening. He would convey the students' opinions to the Ministry of Education for review. Regarding the previous announcement by the Ministry of Personnel that graduates from schools in the recovered areas should be treated as employees in terms of employment, he had also suggested that the Ministry rescind the order, and it had been approved and would be announced publicly. As for the issues of judicial officer, financial personnel, and studying in America examinations, students from the recovered areas are not subject to any restrictions on registration.</p>

<h3>Primary School Curriculum Research Forum</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education held a conference on revising primary school curriculum standards in Shanghai last month. Although some concrete decisions were made, the implementation period is still pending. Primary school curriculum standards are a practical plan for nurturing the nation's young seedlings, and also a concrete plan for building the foundation of the country. Since the relationship is significant, detailed discussions are welcome. With this in mind, the editor has specially created this forum, starting today, to welcome readers to freely express their opinions, in order to provide research. Submissions and discussions from educational experts are especially welcome.</p>
<h3>Calling for Justice for My Deceased Son</h3>
<p>Your newspaper's editorial on the 8th stated: "A child around ten years old has to study more than ten subjects, plus extracurricular activities. How can a child with a fragile body support it? How can a Chinese child with a particularly weak body digest it?" This realistic comment triggered my tragic memories. I had a good seven-year-old child named Wang Yu Ru, who entered the first grade of primary school in the autumn thirteen years ago. That primary school was run very well (according to my foolish thoughts at the time), with complete subjects, a full ten courses. Yu Ru studied very hard, and I was very happy with him and strongly encouraged him (according to my foolish methods at the time). But in the winter of the second year, my obedient Yu Ru died of pulmonary tuberculosis. At that time, I did not blame the school for rigidly teaching, nor did I blame myself for blindly encouraging him; I only blamed the child for having a fatal illness. It was not until now, when your newspaper revealed it, that I realized it was the fault of us parents! The fault of the school teachers! The fault of the experts who revised the curriculum standards! The fault of the government authorities who promulgated the educational system! Now, with an empty lap, recalling it, I have unspeakable regret. Otherwise, Yu Ru would still be here, already a promising young man in his twenties. But... I can't help but cry and can't continue writing. (A parent without children, Lu Lin, 35, 6, 8.)</p>

Mayor Wu personally received them and spoke earnestly to the representatives, stating that since he assumed the position of mayor of Shanghai, he inherited 230 billion yuan in debt, and the financial situation is insufficient to immediately improve the lives of public educators, but given time, after two or three months, when the finances are in order, he will strive to find ways to improve it. Regarding the association's request to increase education funding, reform the education system, and stabilize the lives of teachers, he expressed that he could accept all the principles. He stated that when he was the mayor of Chongqing, he increased education funding from 6.7% of the city's municipal budget to 24%. The education funding of this city will definitely increase, subsidies will be issued in kind, and monthly salaries may also be paid once every half month. All matters related to the welfare of public educators, within the scope of possibility, will be done to the best of his ability, only hoping that the educators will temporarily endure and overcome the difficulties together.</p>

<p>On the West Alliance side, this time, through the contact of Qu Yaokang, Kolarasa, etc., famous players have been gathered into one team, forming a strong and substantial military lineup. Shanghai's first-class Western athletes, such as Xu Erz, Oliveira, Hanni Bo, Roberts Tov, Fafan Xiao, Mai Qidang, Pantson, etc., have all been recruited. Kostantin will personally serve as the captain, and Tiefuni will serve as the left forward in both the first and second halves. The team's defense and forward lines are considered to be strong. According to manager Kolarasa, this time the Hong Kong visiting team came to Shanghai, and this team was invited to compete against them. It was formed hastily, and the Hong Kong team's vast lineup is inevitably dwarfed. However, they will do their best to seek a good performance.

<h3>After Consecutive Declines, Retail Sales Gradually Increase, Rice Prices Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after consecutive sharp declines in the rice market, many transporters suffered losses, the source of supply was slightly reduced, and retailers took advantage to stock up. Medium and low-grade japonica and indica rice both rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. High-grade rice also became strong, and "White Yuan" stabilized. Flour sales became more active, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean sales were normal, increasing slightly by 500 to 600 yuan. Bean cake rose slightly by 100 to 200 yuan, bran rose by 300 to 400 yuan, "Yuan" wheat and wheat remained stable. Raw peanuts fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New broad beans were selling quickly. Due to abundant supply, the oil market was firm early but weak in the afternoon, increasing slightly by several hundred to one thousand yuan. Yesterday, according to the rice market news, the total amount of rice arriving in the city was over 7,000 shi. The types and quantities are as follows: White japonica 2,376 shi, thin rice 1,163 shi, early rice 617 shi, "Sheep" indica 446 shi, "Du" indica 116 shi, "Wu" indica 2,191 shi, and White Yuan 143 shi.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Suddenly Rises by 300,000, Potassium Acid Tartrate Arrival Scarce</h3>
<p>The price of caustic soda in this city has suddenly risen from over 400,000 to 750,000 yuan per barrel after the United States and the Philippines banned exports. According to industry insiders, based on yesterday's bidding situation, there is still the possibility of further increases.</p>
<p>According to a certain raw material import company in this city: Recently, American raw materials arriving at the port include potassium acid tartrate, white wax, petroleum jelly, bleaching powder, and bleaching powder concentrate, sodium sulfide, etc., but the quantity is very small, so the market prices of the above items have not seen any significant decline.</p>
<h3>Rubber Market Prices Gradually Rise, Local Demand Exceeds 1,000 Tons Per Month</h3>
<p>Since London reported that industrial production representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands would be discussing rubber prices in England, Shanghai rubber industry insiders believe that foreign rubber prices will rise. Those holding inventory are unwilling to sell, leading to local rubber market prices rising by more than 40% recently. However, the selling prices in Southeast Asia, where rubber production is higher, are indeed lower than the cost of production, and prices must be raised to maintain profitability. Recently, the rubber market price in Singapore is US$0.21 per pound. The region has abundant production, and the American synthetic rubber industry is developed, with large production volume, so there should be no problem with the world's rubber supply. However, future prices must also be raised above cost. As for China's rubber demand, judging from the more than 40 large and small rubber factories in Shanghai, the total monthly demand is about 1,000 tons. It is also very easy to transport from Singapore to Shanghai. If transportation is smooth, Shanghai prices may be difficult to rise further.</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Bureau Controls Reorganization of Business Tax for Businesses, Sends Letters to Industry Associations to Inform Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently notified various industry associations, stating, "To prevent individual units liable for business profit tax from concealing their reporting during reorganization, transfer, or closing, the Bureau has specifically created control measures for business reorganization, transfer, and liquidation. These measures are attached for strict compliance." The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Matters for Industry Associations to Note</p>
<p>(1) Each industry association shall submit a membership roster to allow for comparison with new membership rosters. For those whose responsible person has changed or whose membership has been canceled, the reasons for the change or cancellation shall be verified. (2) When members of each industry association report liquidation, closing, or reorganization, regardless of whether the license number is changed, in addition to notifying the member to report to the nearest district office, the association should also report it to the Bureau as a special case to ensure strict control. (3) Each industry association shall immediately notify its members that transferees may not assume businesses that have been liquidated or closed without paying taxes. If they have already assumed the business, the transferee shall be liable for recovery of the owed taxes. (4) Each industry association shall report the number of members added or decreased each month to the Bureau, clearly stating the license number, address, responsible person, and capital amount of the members added or decreased.</p>
<p>Matters for District Offices to Note</p>
<p>(1) When the district offices conduct a census of businesses, they shall first carefully investigate the date of establishment of the business and the connection of all account books. If a transfer occurred after September 9, Year 34, the current owner should be ordered to report it and recover the various taxes owed by the seller. (2) If the census personnel find that a business has been liquidated, is being liquidated, or has been assumed, but the business has not joined any industry association, they should be ordered to provide a guarantor for review and submit the guarantee to the Bureau for approval. (3) When investigating businesses opened in Year 35, census personnel should carefully inquire about the original location and the license name and responsible person in Year 34, and order the responsible person of the newly opened business to urge reporting. (4) The district offices should carefully verify the basis for each business's increased capital to investigate whether it is an actual investment of funds. If it is the appreciation of assets converted into capital, the liquidation profit tax should be reported and paid first. (5) The district offices shall fill out and submit a business unit change investigation form weekly for each business reorganized, transferred, closed, increased capital after September 34, and for each business opened in Year 35.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches See New High Price</h3>
<p>Jinshan yuan branches are in short supply, and many have been out of stock for days. Now, a few Nanshi companies have shipped some in, and buyers are rushing to purchase them, resulting in a tight market. The market suddenly rose by about 30% yesterday, reaching an unprecedented high price.</p>
<h3>Over Fifty Pieces of Lake Silk Shipped from Shanghai to England Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Taikoo Lan Yantze Company's "Pisienne" left Shanghai for Europe today, carrying over fifty pieces of Lake silk and two hundred boxes of fur, bound for Liverpool. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Yanguan" sailed to Shantou and Amoy today, carrying 1,590 pieces of cotton yarn, 99 pieces of piece goods, 270 pieces of tobacco, and 1,300 pieces of bean cake to Shantou; and 210 pieces of cotton yarn, 330 pieces of piece goods, 7,100 bags of wheat bran, over 1,000 bags of soybeans, and 600 pieces of bean cake to Amoy.</p>
<p>Another report says that the Huangxing wheel returned to Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday, carrying 759 tons of coal.</p>
<h3>Timber Business is Difficult to Operate, Freight Costs are Too High, Foreign Goods are Dumped</h3>
<p>The timber business in Shanghai was booming during the war due to blocked transportation in various places and urgent needs, so prices rose daily. After the victory, transportation gradually recovered, and timber from domestic production areas such as Wenzhou and Fuzhou began to be shipped to Shanghai. The source of timber from the United States and Canada is also gradually abundant, but the cost of transporting round logs from the producing area to Shanghai requires seven times the freight cost, and flat logs require twice the cost. The flat log business is affected by foreign goods and has not improved. Round logs are still profitable, but currently, high transportation costs and lack of ships are the two major obstacles to timber arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Sales are Sporadic, Guangdong Goods Continue to Trend Downward</h3>
<p>Inventories of Chinese medicine and Guangdong goods were originally low, but recently, large quantities have arrived, and although there are sales, they are sporadic. Under the imbalance of supply and demand, prices continue to trend downward.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the "E" bonds of the Unified Government Bond will be redeemed on the 10th of this month at the Bank Association Club at 59 Hong Kong Road.</p>
<p>More than 200 Shanghai industry associations have been reorganized and consolidated so far. Those that have not been organized are limited to forming organizations before the 23rd of this month. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has also decided to convene the ninth membership meeting this month, so the election of directors and supervisors, if the association has not been organized at that time, will not be allowed to attend.</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held its first expanded preparatory meeting in Beijing on the 5th of last month. It is reported that the conference is expected to be established next month.</p>
<p>The China Textile Machinery Construction Company's business is difficult to launch because the work of taking over factories has not been completed. According to the general manager of the company, Huang Boqiao, the reasons for the difficulty include six points: (1) Factory buildings and equipment do not meet needs. (2) The work and skills of the original workers are far from ideal. (3) Machines are old and difficult to meet manufacturing goals. (4) Raw materials are lacking. (5) Prices are fluctuating, and costs cannot be calculated. (6) Power is insufficient.</p>
<h3>Pig Commission is Less Than Three Point Five Percent, Only About One Point Six Percent</h3>
<p>The pig industry in this city will reduce the commission to 3.5% per hundred [yuan], and some people have formally proposed it. This newspaper has briefly recorded it. According to a letter from the Fresh Pig Industry Association, the actual commission is only about 1.6%. The original letter is as follows: Your newspaper's economic news column published the news "Pig Commission Reduction," stating that each pig farm has agreed that the commission includes strapping feet, shearing hair, weighing, and handling, all at 3.5%. After consulting with the member firms of this Association about self-established pig farms, the highest fee in the past was 2% and the lowest was 1%. In the past, in order to unify the fees, a meeting was convened with the persons in charge of each pig farm and it was decided to change to calculating by head, and reduce the collection to 1,000 yuan of stack fees per head. Other fees: grasping each head 500 yuan, warehousing each head 500 yuan, totaling Legal Currency 2,000 yuan, equivalent to about 1.6% based on the market price. Other shearing hair, weighing, etc., have never been charged, so there is no need to arrive immediately. Please check and correct.</p>
<h3>Coal Production is Increasing, But Supply Still Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>(Tianjin, 6th) The Kailuan Coal Mine in North China has been actively increasing production since it was taken over. The monthly output of the mine since December 34 is as follows: December 34 was 281,000 tons, January of this year was 291,000 tons, February was 300,300 tons, March was 320,100 tons, April was reduced to 283,900 tons due to a strike by miners, and May was approximately 330,000 tons. The total monthly demand in various regions is estimated to be 150,000 tons in Qingdao, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and the Yangtze River basin, and 245,000 tons in North China, for a total of 395,000 tons. Comparing this with the mine's production and sales volume in May, the difference is only more than 60,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Wool Fabrics Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>Wool fabrics, due to the lack of production and inventory, are able to maintain the current situation, even during the summer off-season. Spot transactions are always based on opportunity. People want to sell but cannot sell, and they want to buy but cannot buy. Actual sales are successively decreasing, and dismantling interest is eating into capital, far from what it used to be. In view of the fact that Huichang Zhicheng and other firms went bankrupt one after another after eating interest on purchases, drawing a lesson from the past, the industry is much more cautious in accepting checks and bills of exchange. There were some inquiries from Henan and Changsha yesterday, and small-amount purchases led to a trend of renewed improvement in limited fine wool fabrics.</p>
<h3>Domestic Sales of Tea Remain Strong</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea and uncolored green tea were most popular in the United States before the war. Recently, although South America has repeatedly inquired, they fear the price is too high, so shipments have been rare. As for various domestic sales varieties, demand from customers remains urgent. In addition, as more and more stores are being added in the street, transactions are extremely active. In terms of price, those holding goods intend to raise them, resuming old habits. However, in the midst of the sharp drop in rice prices these days, there is no reason to raise prices, and the result is a firm situation.</p>
<h3>Medium-Grained White Sugar Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was firm. Although the China Grain and Oil Company has weekly releases of medium-grained white sugar, the market price eased, and demand revived. With supply and demand matching, the price tightened again. The company's spot goods in mid-market were 71,000 to 71,500 yuan in the morning, and the company's warehouse receipt was 70,500 to 71,000 yuan. In the afternoon, spot goods were 72,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 71,500 to 71,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The price of goods sold by merchants was 75,000 yuan for ordinary yellow powder, 70,500 to 68,000 yuan for Xinghua red, 60,000 yuan for the "Ti Zhuang" green, and 71,000 yuan for Huanggang red. A total of 400 to 500 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Small Radio</h3>
<p>Fits in the Palm of Your Hand</p>
<p>Ten and a Half Inches Long, Six Inches High</p>
<p>British Information Office, London, August 8th: Britain is manufacturing a new type of small wireless radio, ten and a half inches long, six inches wide, and six inches high, which fits in the palm of your hand. This new radio is called the "Planet" radio, and the colors are very detailed and eye-catching. The first batch of samples will be black and ivory, and various colors of radios will be manufactured successively. The sound reception will be exceptionally clear, truly a complete wireless radio. In addition, shortwave radios will be supplied to overseas markets.</p>
<h3>Bulls and Bears Waiting to Take Action, Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Mediocre</h3>
<p>The general trend of Chinese stocks is gradually stabilizing. With bulls and bears waiting to take action, the process is mostly sideways. Popular and unpopular stocks are all mediocre. Yongsheng Yarn needs to exchange receipts soon, and there is a rumor of stopping trading. Although there has been no formal announcement by the large brokers, buyers have clearly turned to American Asia. The high price of Yongsheng Yarn is 5,950 yuan, American Asia is 4,380 yuan, Jingfu is 325 yuan, Xinguang is 318 yuan, and Qinxing is 245 yuan. The low price of Yongsheng Yarn is 5,780 yuan, American Asia is 4,200 yuan, Jingfu is 305 yuan, Xinguang is 300 yuan, and Qinxing is 230 yuan. As a result, popular stocks, large and small, rose slightly compared to the previous close. Unpopular small stocks were quite stable yesterday because they had risen too much. Medium-sized stocks continued to rise slightly. Foreign stocks were also mediocre. Jardine Matheson opened around 12,200 yuan, and there was profit-taking, falling slightly to 11,600 yuan. The financial sector recovered slightly, allowing it to maintain. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock Marden, and Asia Steel fell by half a percent, Jardine Matheson and Jardine Brewery fell slightly, Union Insurance was flat, and Paper Industries rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Canned Food Industry Asks to Take Over Taiwan Canned Food Factory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Canned Food Industry Association held its second board of directors meeting yesterday, resolving to send a telegram to the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office of Agriculture and Forestry, requesting permission to take over the Taiwan Canned Food Factory to facilitate the development of the national canned food industry. They plan to use a cooperative approach to establish close ties with the office, using the factory bases, assets, and machinery of the Taiwan factories and members' investments as working capital to start work. However, relying on Japanese technical personnel is not a long-term solution, and they plan to send the technical staff of the Shanghai Association's factories one after another. As for the promotion and sales of manufactured goods, the Shanghai industry will be fully responsible, and all factory administration will be supervised and guided by the Office of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (13)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi of this Newspaper</p>
<p>We cannot believe that the conclusion of three years of recovery is an academic conclusion, but believe that it is a political propaganda conclusion. That is to say, this is a statement made without investigation.</p>
<p>Our conversation quickly turned in another direction. The dishes we ate today were the best Chinese dishes I had ever tasted since arriving in Changchun. When talking about the destruction of the Shenyang Arsenal, Peng Zhen particularly expressed his gratification. The Shenyang Arsenal is naturally a military industry, so the issue is particularly clear, and Peng Zhen also had a clear answer. He said:</p>
<p>"This destruction is good, otherwise the Kuomintang would have had more capital for civil war."</p>
<h3>March of the Banquet Conversation</h3>
<p>In truth, this logic could also be applied to other industrial losses, but the question of whether it constitutes a "matter of debate" remains unaddressed.</p>
<p>We will always remember this banquet. On the fourth, we suddenly felt the atmosphere of the Four Powers shift. Wheeler, as a result, considered going to Harbin to take a look.</p>
<p>This issue was raised when Zhou Baozhong treated us to dinner, but his response was: Harbin is Harbin's affair, and he cannot decide, but he can raise it with the Northeast Bureau. When Kai Feng came on the third, we discussed it again. He strongly agreed and said that a special train could be arranged immediately. Later, because an airplane came to pick us up unexpectedly, we abandoned our plans to go to Harbin on the evening of the fourth.</p>
<p>We all felt that Kai Feng was a person who had suffered hardship. He was thin and pale, with gaps in his teeth. He spoke softly, wearing a gray Zhongshan suit, a scarf, and a gray cloth army cap, looking like a low-level civil servant in Chongqing, haggard and malnourished from the pressures of life. However, his eyes were very spirited. He now holds an important position in the Northeast Bureau; he is one of the committee members. When he first met us, he looked nervous and focused, which was very incongruous with our "carefree and casual" appearance. He had worked at the Yan'an Liberation Daily and the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, writing his conclusions. The journalist friends he knew were also friends we knew. When asked if he had written any articles recently, he replied, "I haven't written anything in five years."</p>
<p>He was one of the hosts at the banquet that day, but he spoke the least. Wei Zhi interviewed him for news, asking about the land distribution situation and what was happening with the priced land acquisition near Fushun.</p>
<p>He gave an example, saying:</p>
<p>"For example, near Meihekou (the location of the Democratic Allied Army headquarters), there is a village with 300 households. This area has cultivated land that was seized by the Japanese. After the Japanese left, the villagers' assembly decided how to divide it. After calculating, each adult could be allocated one 'tian' of land (in the Northeast, the amount of land one person with two horses can cultivate in a day, approximately six mu). They would gain ownership of this land and could then sell or lease it, but with the condition that rent must be reduced by 25%. Currently, there is a problem with cultivated land in the Northeast. Many paddy fields left by the Japanese are not known how to cultivate by Northeasterners. They do not want these paddy fields, even though the production yield is three times higher than dry land." He continued, "There are no regulations for priced land acquisition in land distribution. If mining land is currently not being exploited, it cannot be allowed to lie fallow and can be distributed, but it will be reclaimed when exploitation begins. The priced land acquisition issue is likely due to problems with lower-level implementation."</p>
<p>He then added, "The Northeast Bureau is in Changchun for the same reason. Changchun is an important place, and we must do it well and make fewer mistakes."</p>
<p>Their personnel have a stock phrase: "We completely accept your criticism." Once this sentence is uttered, the other party has no choice but to shut their mouth, and any serious questioning dissipates into thin air.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Lü Zhengcao announced that the Northeast Army currently under their command has a full 100,000 men. Take Zhang Xueshi as an example. When he came out of the pass (Shanhaiguan), he only had a little over 2,000 people.</p>
<p>According to Lü Zhengcao, almost all of the cadres in the Northeast Army under their command are Northeasterners, and almost all are young people who fled and cannot return to their hometowns. Their homes are under the iron heel of the Japanese puppets. They want to go home and "fight their way back home." They hate the Japanese devils, and the flames of blood debt are burning in their hearts. Therefore, once they set foot on their vast native land, many young people who longed to avenge their national and personal grievances followed the banner of the old Northeast Army to "fight their way back home" and joined their ranks to disarm the Japanese devils.</p>
<p>Lü Zhengcao is about forty years old, thin and with a gentle demeanor, not looking like a soldier. He is from Haicheng, Liaoning, and speaks with a Haicheng accent. He is currently the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and Commander-in-Chief of the West Manchuria Military Region. He is a graduate of the Shenyang Military Academy and a good classmate of Zhao Jiaqi, Wan Yi, and Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the government's city defense in Changchun who was wounded this time. He still remembers the story of Wan Yi placing second and Zhao Jiaqi placing fourth in their class.</p>
<p>We didn't know the name Lü Zhengcao very well. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, he was a regimental commander under Liu Duoji, and perhaps it was this regiment that had the closest relationship with the Communist army at the time. Perhaps it was at this time that he converted to the Communist Party. We didn't have time to ask him these questions, but he made it very clear to us that he himself is a member of the Communist Party and a member of the Central Committee of the CCP.</p>
<p>He knows that the people of the Northeast have suffered too much and cannot have another civil war, so he also opposes the civil war. He is full of talk of peace and democracy, saying, "If the Northeast does not have peace for a day and democracy for a moment, then China will not have a moment of tranquility."</p>
<p>Therefore, he said, "The Northeast Army in the Northeast will absolutely fight against the anti-peace and anti-democracy front."</p>
<p>The focus of our conversation was concentrated on national affairs, so the atmosphere became depressing. We shifted the focus of the conversation to Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>Lü said, "Zhang Hanqing is my old superior. I once served as his staff officer and adjutant. We have always disapproved of his past romantic life." However, Lü believes that in the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang acted entirely for the country and the nation, forgetting his personal interests. He does not harbor a trace of selfishness. If he is released now and if he still holds the same spirit as before, I will naturally respect him and respect Hanqing's personality. Speaking of this, he suddenly analyzed the reasons why Chen Jiazhen did not surrender.</p>
<p>He said that he and Chen Jiazhen are not only classmates but also fellow townsmen, both living on the same street in Haicheng. After graduating from school, they were both old subordinates of Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army. During the War of Resistance, Chen Jiazhen spent his entire career as a staff member in Chongqing, and he never had much success. So now that he has become the city defense commander, he is eager to do something for himself and pave a way for his future. Unexpectedly, he failed completely this time, and he ultimately became disabled.</p>
<p>We didn't know about Chen Jiazhen's injury. We wanted to visit him, but we had no freedom at all, so we eagerly shifted the topic back to Chen Jiazhen.</p>
<p>Lü said, "The day after I arrived here, I went to the hospital to support and visit Jiazhen. We hadn't seen each other for almost ten years. The first words I used to comfort Jiazhen were to tell him that his old home in Haicheng is still very safe. He was shot in the thigh, with the bullet hitting the thigh bone. He didn't get to the hospital until six days after he was injured. His thigh was swollen, as thick as the opening of a washbasin. The Japanese doctor said he might be disabled."</p>
<p>We were silent for a long time and couldn't say anything. We were indeed saddened. Chen Jiazhen was originally a typical honest and loyal soldier. Although his performance this time was relatively weak, it was definitely not something he could have reversed on his own. We deeply regretted that it is not a simple thing for the country to cultivate a general. In the end, being disabled in this kind of situation, we really didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>Lü also felt some regret that his classmate was fighting his classmate.</p>
<p>Finally, Lippmann told a story about the American Civil War. He said, "Our Civil War was fundamentally a civil war, and classmates from West Point would turn against each other and fight. But peace will eventually come."</p>
<p>Lü Zhengcao raised his glass to him and said, "Let's drink to the peace we long for!"</p>
<h3>Meeting Zhang Xueshi</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueshi's sister in Shanghai had asked Lippmann to visit her fourth brother when he went to the Northeast. Before Lippmann left Shanghai, she entrusted him with a letter to Zhang Xueshi.</p>
<p>When the Communist army occupied Changchun, Lippmann inquired about Zhang Xueshi's whereabouts. People inside the pass considered it a "mystery" whether Zhang Xueshi actually existed and about his mysterious whereabouts.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, just as we were going to Zhou Baozhong's late-night banquet at the Yamato Hotel, Lippmann continued to inquire about Zhang Xueshi's news. He learned from Zhou Baozhong that Zhang Xueshi was in Benxi. He was overjoyed and wanted to go to Benxi to meet him immediately. But then he thought about his freedom being in the hands of the hosts on the other side, so he had no choice but to give the short letter written on the small card in his pocket to Zhou Baozhong to pass on to Zhang Xueshi.</p>
<p>On May 4th, the day when Peng Zhen, Lü Zhengcao, Zhou Baozhong, Kai Feng, and others from the Northeast Bureau treated us to dinner, Shi Xun saw the news in the Northeast Daily that "Northeast University President Zhang Xueshi Arrives in Changchun to Hold Opening Ceremony" and immediately told Lippmann. He was overjoyed and said, "I really want to see this young marshal's brother."</p>
<p>So after dinner, Lü Zhengcao, Lippmann, and Shi Xun sat around a small square table in the lounge. Our first question was, "Is it true that Zhang Xueshi has arrived?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he originally planned to attend this reception for you journalist gentlemen tonight, but he is too busy with Northeast University matters, so he couldn't come," Lü replied.</p>
<p>Lippmann explained his eagerness to meet Zhang Xueshi, and Lü Zhengcao promised to find him to talk with us tomorrow.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, Lü Zhengcao sent an adjutant to bring a car, and also asked Zhou Baozhong's secretary Liu Ke to accompany us. Liu said that Zhang Xueshi was waiting for us at Lü Zhengcao's home.</p>
<p>It was a morning when the first rain had not stopped, and the fine spring rain on the Northeast's desert-like Taiyuan Road was a very welcome thing. We had been parched for so many days, so seeing the spring rain, we were naturally very happy and didn't have the same feeling of annoyance with the spring rain as the people of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>We all waited in the reception room. In less than three minutes, Lü Zhengcao led Zhang Xueshi downstairs. Zhang Xueshi stood in the middle of us, wearing a neatly pressed military uniform and yellow riding boots. His thin figure made him look very handsome. His appearance, with a Northern University vibe, resembled Zhang Xueliang when he was young. He was not as casually dressed as the average Communist soldier.</p>
<p>He told us that he is now thirty-two years old. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, he was in the tenth class of the Nanjing Central Military Academy. He was able to use foreign languages freely and spoke reasonably well when talking with several American colleagues. We were surprised by his English skills. He said that he was a graduate of Huimen Middle School in Beijing.</p>
<p>After the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), he joined the Eighth Route Army and fought with the Japanese devils in North China and Central China for seven or eight years. He said, "I want to avenge this national shame and personal feud." He also admitted that when he returned to the Northeast last September, he had only a little over 2,000 men under his command. He told us that more than half of his cadres were from the old Northeast Army.</p>
<p>When we mentioned Zhang Xueliang, he first asked, "You gentlemen all came from inside the pass, but I wonder if my elder brother is still well? I haven't seen him for nine years." His facial expression was very concerned when he said this.</p>
<p>Lippmann replied, "I wanted to visit him last year, but the Chinese government didn't allow me to go. But I heard indirectly that he has gained a lot of weight while in revolution and has also read a lot of books." Zhang Xueshi didn't say anything, leaned his head on the back of the sofa, and stared straight at the ceiling."</p>
<p>After a while, he asked, "Have you heard news of my elder brother being released?"</p>
<p>We told him that we sometimes saw this kind of news in the newspapers, but we didn't know if it was true. Then he said:</p>
<p>"After the Xi'an Incident, Song Ziwen guaranteed that he would go to Nanjing once and then let him return immediately. I went to see my elder brother at the time, and he told me that he did the Xi'an Incident entirely for the country and the nation, not for himself. So now he should be released."</p>
<p>We then asked him, "If he is released now, would you still follow him and take the same political views?"</p>
<p>"If my elder brother remains unchanged, continues with the style of the Xi'an Incident, and continues to walk the path of democracy, I will naturally support him. However, I deeply understand his character, and he will not change."</p>
<p>After that, he said that his troops are all near Benxi and that he recently returned to Changchun from Benxi. He has 25,000 men under him. He also told us that he is married and has two children.</p>
<p>As we were about to leave, Lippmann asked him if he had any letters to take to his sister. He thought for a moment and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Ask her how she is. Please tell her that I am most concerned about my elder brother."</p>
<p>Zhang Xueshi is a young soldier. The Communist side says that he is the democratically elected chairman of Liaoning Province and also the president of Northeast University, but he has never admitted that he is a Communist Party member. He refused to express an opinion on this issue. He said that he had been to Yan'an once in 1938 and stayed for a few months. After that, he was with Lü Zhengcao on the front lines of North China.

<h3>Anhui Province's Top Traitor, Wang Shan-cheng, Sentenced to Death; Mother, Wife, and Daughters Commit Group Suicide</h3>
<p>— Wuhu Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 3rd [of the month] Correspondent Bai Yuwen</p>
<p>The brothers Li Lexin and Li Leqi from Chaoxian County and the brothers Wang Zidong and Wang Shancheng from Wuhu, all top traitors of Anhui province, were either gangsters or unscrupulous businessmen in the past and had no concept of the nation or state. After Wuhu fell [to the Japanese], these people colluded with the Japanese enemy to control materials, led Japanese troops to various counties to collect military grain, opened banks, disrupted the financial system, and collected piles of timber. Later, a flash flood destroyed the Lishe Bridge in Wuhu, killing and injuring more than a hundred boatmen and pedestrians, but no one dared to question [the brothers]. They traveled with Japanese soldiers as escorts, and the warehouses and houses set up by the Li brothers extended from Chaoxian to Wuhu, Nanjing, Suzhou, Nantong, and Shanghai, their power and influence being blatant and causing widespread resentment. After the recovery, except for Wang Shancheng, who was arrested, the others all had great connections and secretly escaped. The confiscated property only accounted for a very small portion. The Li brothers have gradually had their family members come forward to rent some of the houses to powerful people. Those responsible seem to have no time to investigate.</p>
<p>The arrest and sentencing to death of the traitor Wang Shancheng was met with popular acclaim. After he was sentenced to death, in addition to his son Wang Yongxue and shop staff going to Beijing to request a retrial, his elderly mother, wife, and daughters, out of terror, ingested opium together yesterday and attempted a group suicide. Fortunately, they were discovered early and most were rescued. Only his third daughter is still in critical condition due to ingesting too much poison. A collective suicide of an entire family of traitors is unprecedented since the start of the anti-traitor work. This is specially recorded for the readers of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers: Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Du Zhijie asks: I am thirty-four years old and have always been weak. A lump suddenly appeared behind my anus last month. It is slightly painful when pressed, and slightly enlarged during bowel movements, but not noticeably painful. The doctor said it is an anal fistula, and there is still little pus after the operation, making it difficult to heal. He also said that it is related to lung disease. I am extremely anxious. How should I treat it? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] According to your letter, I fear it is a tuberculous fistula-in-ano. You must treat the tuberculosis first, using artificial pneumothorax or injecting glucose calcium vitamin C, etc. At the same time, irradiate the wound with a sun lamp and treat it with medicated cloth. Surgical treatment is necessary if needed.</p>
<p>(2) Sheng Fangying asks: I have three questions. Please answer them: (1) What method can cure excessive dandruff (dandruff)? (2) What method can cure a heart that is easily startled and beats wildly? (3) What is the simplest treatment for spermatorrhea? Can it be cured without medication?</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] (1) Use dandruff shampoo. (2) A detailed examination of the heart is necessary. (3) To treat spermatorrhea, you must strengthen the body and replenish blood, and take Lupulin pills.</p>
<p>(3) Mei Wu asks: Editor, I suffer from hereditary bromidrosis. Is there any effective medicine or injection that can cure it? Please answer.</p>
<p>[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] Bromidrosis can be treated with surgery. It is best to go to a specialist surgeon or dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment, which can be effective.</p>
<h3>Where are the Remains of Martyred Patriots Stored?</h3>
<p>Editor: Qian Yishi was a native of Xianning County, Hubei Province. He was orphaned and poor in his youth, but he was intelligent, had great ambitions, and was proficient in classical Chinese. He also excelled in English, French, Russian, and Japanese. He was renowned in Wuhan's education circles. After coming to Shanghai, he served as a professor at various universities for many years and was the chief editor of the New China Magazine published by the Zhonghua Book Company. During the August 13th [Shanghai] War of Resistance, he served as a major general advisor under General Zhang Fawu, where he assisted in defending Pudong. As a result, he overworked himself and fell ill at the Nanxiang Field Hospital and died. At that time, his family had retreated to Hubei. Fortunately, with the help of friends, the body was transferred to Shanghai for embalming. Now, after nine years, I don't know where the remains are stored. Mr. Qian's family has sent a letter asking me to investigate, but I don't know where to start. Please grant me a corner of your newspaper to disclose this information. If any of Qian's friends during his lifetime know the location of the remains, please send a letter to No. 331 Jinling East Road or call 82043 so that I can inform Qian's family. I would be most grateful. Respectfully yours, Li Xingchu</p>

<h3>Taiwan Black Market</h3>
<p>— Air Mail Report, May 28th, Evening News</p>
<p>Taiwan is our paradise, the Switzerland of the East. Our government authorities, especially the chief administrator of Taiwan, if they do a good job, there is already a good foundation there, which makes things twice as easy and achieves quick results.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Taiwan Dollar</p>
<p>Why is Taiwan not using the legal tender? This is what most people in the country cannot understand.</p>
<p>In our chaotic country, it is absolutely impossible to get politics completely on track in a short time. The most obvious thing about all the measures in Taiwan is that the currency value is very stable. With a stable currency value, the lives of the Taiwanese people are also stable. Compared to the Shanghai merchants stirring up trouble and causing the citizens to always be worried about the "crazy" soaring prices, it is much better here. The exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender is set at one to thirty. If it were one to one, smart Shanghai businessmen would have already moved all the resources here in entire ships. Do you think the Taiwanese people could still live? Now, merchants cannot profit. They no longer think of "going to Taiwan." Chen Yi saw through the terrible nature and ever-changing tricks of Shanghai merchants. In order to protect the Taiwanese people, he had to first adopt a closed-door policy, implementing measures to raise the value of the Taiwan dollar to resist merchants taking advantage of opportunities, making huge profits, and plunging the Taiwanese people into deep water. Because merchants could not get rich, everyone complained and spread rumors to slander Chen. Because the reaction of prices after the war is unavoidable, but the limit of the reaction has a great impact on people's livelihood, adapting to local conditions is a necessary need. Currently, the official price of the Taiwan dollar is one to thirty, but the black market is only around twenty-two yuan. Recently, the exchange rate between the customs gold unit and the Taiwan dollar has risen from 80% to 93%, which means that the black market value of the Taiwan dollar has fallen to around 22 legal tender. Conversely, the legal tender has an external value of eight out of thirty, unlike the price increases in Shanghai, which always devalue the legal tender. I ask you: Is there a situation in the country where the black market price is lower than the official price? This is a miracle, and it is also the greatest success of Taiwan's economic policy.</p>
<p>Rampant Thieves</p>
<p>What people hate most now when going to Taiwan is that there are too many thieves, and it is impossible to guard against them. This is another point of dissatisfaction with the administrative authorities. The authorities also feel very regretful and are studying countermeasures. If you think back to the Taiwan of the past, how could it be possible to achieve "doors left open at night"? The reasons are: (1) Guiding the local petty thieves to do evil and develop outwards, going to various parts of our country to become vagrants. (2) Driving the petty thieves to concentrate on isolated islands, unable to gain a foothold in Taiwan. (3) Kicking the thieves on the street when they were caught (the most contemptuous punishment for the kicked) and sentencing them to imprisonment. After a theft occurred, the first thing was to catch the previously convicted thief and interrogate them again, so being a thief would suffer for life. Therefore, no one dared to be a thief. And (4) the police are all in plain clothes, very responsible for patrolling the streets. When there are no police on the road, the police come when something happens. Thieves who stole things were often caught. Anyone who found a thief would bravely report them. We feel that the fourth point is the most important, and it can be a good example for domestic police affairs. The spirit of mutual assistance among the people should also be cultivated. Now, a large number of vagrants have been repatriated to Taiwan. After the Japanese left, no one supervised the large number of exiled people on the isolated islands, and they sneaked back.</p>
<p>Fearsome Drought</p>
<p>In terms of the cityscape, Taiwan is very "gaunt." Like other places, it almost all suffers from this anemia. The lack of materials and the decline in purchasing power are all factors that cannot restore prosperity for a while. But Taiwan has products and resources, especially rice, which can be harvested three times a year. Currently, rice is expensive and there is some panic. In Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places, there has been no rain for several months, and there are signs of drought. When this reporter first came to Taipei in early May, it was sunny and hot every day with little rain, and the river water was very shallow. I am really worried about the Taiwanese people and the authorities. If there is a drought, how will the Taiwanese people suffer, and how will the authorities have a hard time recovering. Fortunately, it has been raining every day these past few days. Heaven can be beautiful, and in two months, the newborn Taiwan will not only be able to relieve the food panic, but the authorities will also be able to concentrate on reorganization work.</p>
<h3>The Voice of the Exiled Group (2)</h3>
<p>Editor: My heart, which has been suffering all day, has made me issue a roar of hot blood that I can no longer tolerate. In fact, it may just be a moan on the edge of life. The meaning of writing this letter is only to hope that the general gentlemen living in luxury and those evil villains who build their happiness on the suffering of others can still think for a moment that in one corner of the "Big Four Powers," the "Magnificent China," there lives a group of people, and I hope that those who transfer political documents will see how the people of northern Jiangsu are struggling.</p>
<p>Let me start with myself. I am from Jingjiang, northern Jiangsu, a first-year student at XX National University. From the perspective of northern Jiangsu, I am able to study, which is enough to satisfy me. However, how heartbreaking are the wanderers after the victory!</p>
<p>My hometown is bankrupt, and even the ambition to study cannot be realized. Because northern Jiangsu is a different environment! Even if you study behind closed doors, it is not difficult to lose your life. Helplessly, I have to wander. Now, I am a university student, but in terms of food, I don't know where the meal money will come from tomorrow. There is no way to borrow money, and I am treated with disdain. Should I go back? I am catching up with the high tide of "killing the three assets." Should I drop out of school? Unless I sleep on the street. I don't know why the government doesn't simply take back northern Hebei. If you say you are following some false faith and meaningless negotiations, then why is Sipin Street fighting so fiercely? Isn't the Northeast part of China? Aren't the communists and the national army fighting in the Northeast? Then why not unify the military and administration, tax collection, and currency system? Since the victory in September, you collect donations, he collects public grain, money from the countryside cannot be used in the city, money from the city cannot be used in the countryside, there are conflicts in the east, and killings in the west. By the time the gentlemen stop fighting, the people will have already died! Especially infuriating is the talk about relief, relief! I have been wandering to this day, and I have not seen any relief given to the youth of northern Jiangsu. When there is really no way, I may have to go back to my hometown to engage in revolution, although it will harm a part of my compatriots even more, at least I will not starve to death in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Let me talk about several of my fellow students from northern Jiangsu. Their parents, brothers, and sisters either live in Yangzhou or Zhenjiang. In the past, they all had a beautiful name, "farming and reading family." They lived a leisurely and harmonious life in the green wilderness and in the villages surrounded by streams. But now, in the so-called "liberated" world, they are regarded as bloodsucking capitalists and expelled by the revolutionaries. In fact, only heaven knows about the capitalist class in the Chinese countryside. However, in terms of justice, the lives of ordinary tenants are indeed bitter enough. Land redistribution is something that must be implemented in China. But what about now that it is "liberated"? Only even more suffering is given to the ordinary tenants. In addition to the public grain and miscellaneous taxes at each level, the "military enlistment movement," which still exists after the victory, has ruined many pitiful lives. "Who has no parents? Who has no wife?" They are just using the simple thinking of low-level people, giving them the capital to gamble for power and wealth. It is really pitiful! And the result? It is called revolution, but in fact, it has taken the lives of the landlords and even more severely taken the lives of many ignorant and loyal farmers! I don't need to say much about the situation in northern Jiangsu now. I dare not make a definitive judgment on the situation in northern Jiangsu. Just based on my ten days of rural life during my vacation, when I went back, because the KMT-CPC negotiations had not yet been completed, the countryside was still peaceful. At that time, I personally saw many farmers eating aster grass (the Shanghai people call it alfalfa). They had no resentment, they had no suffering, only a kind of perseverance of our national character. They did not leave hatred to anyone. They were like a group of weak and masterless lambs, or like an old ox whipped to work. They do not know for personal survival, they engage in mass production all day long. Great administrative officials, how can you be worthy of such docile and pitiful people? They are ignorant, and they have no tongue. They swallow their bitter tears in secret, they drink their own blood! But their blood is about to be sucked dry!</p>
<p>Editor, I have spent most of my night writing this letter. The outside of the window is so dark, as if the light has been devoured by something. Fortunately, I will not be able to do my homework tonight. However, I seem to have a lot of things to say that are stuck in my throat and I can't spit out. Just this little thing, if the teacher can put it in front of the readers and let the gentlemen know, I will be very grateful. A declining youth from northern Jiangsu at Fudan University.</p>

<h3>Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles, a varied and colorful life is a necessary condition for a writer and an artist.</p>
<p>Liu Shi, a young Chinese painter, with the Anti-Japanese War as a dividing line, has undergone a great leap in his emotions, especially in his artistic depth. Even though he has not yet produced works that reflect or represent this great era in his painting work during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, if he had stayed in the occupied areas, even if he did not make offerings to the enemy puppets, could he have understood the meaning of these eight years? Could he have breathed the moving atmosphere of the tens of millions of people in the motherland resisting the war?</p>
<p>For the past eight years, his days have been spent entirely on the battlefield. He rushed to various battlefields as a political worker. If we talk about understanding war, understanding the lives of soldiers, and understanding the countryside, he will not be less than anyone.</p>
<p>From the 7th to the 13th, he held a week-long exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association. It is said that all the works are fish. Among Chinese painters, Mr. Wang Yating is known for his fish. Liu Shi is naturally a rising star, but why does he specialize in painting fish? Perhaps Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering" is the result of our pursuit of this question.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1934, I saw Liu Shi's exhibition at Sanshodo in Kanda Ward, Tokyo. At that time, all his works were oil paintings. It has been twelve years since then. I think his exhibition this time will definitely surprise me.</p>
<h3>The Existence or Non-Existence of the Defense Corps</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhensheng</p>
<p>I remember that at the previous meeting of the Municipal Council, a councilor raised questions about the defense corps. The meaning was, "There are military and police forces everywhere in this city, which is enough to maintain law and order. Why waste money and resources to support this group of defense corps that disturbs the people?" Recently, there has been news that the defense corps will be reorganized into security police, and it is also rumored that the defense corps, except for permanent members, will be disbanded. Because the organization of the defense corps has a very close relationship with local security, I have to take the position of the people to discuss whether the organization of the defense corps has any value in existing.</p>
<p>The urban area of ​​Shanghai is convenient for transportation, and the military and police forces are everywhere. The layout of the security network is already quite tight. In the event of disturbances, the military and police can quickly arrive at the scene to maintain order. The councilor expressed dissatisfaction with the organization of another defense corps based on the situation in the urban area, which is not without reason. However, the situation in the suburbs of this city cannot be compared with that in the urban area.</p>
<p>The suburbs of this city have vast land and scattered population. Therefore, the garrison of the military and police has to be limited to some larger towns. However, the hideouts of bandits and bandit cases are often in remote rural areas. Therefore, the military and police in the suburbs have the difficulty of maintaining law and order in taking care of one thing and losing sight of another.</p>
<p>The order in the suburbs of this city is very quiet during the day, and the military and police personnel have almost no work. When it is late at night, the bandits will suddenly attack. Because of the inconvenient transportation and other reasons in the suburbs, the military and police feel that it is beyond their reach to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>The above are all obvious facts. Therefore, there are many reasons for organizing a defense corps in the suburbs of this city to take on the responsibility of assisting in maintaining law and order. As far as I know, several points can be listed again.</p>
<p>The towns and villages in the suburbs vary in size. The outskirts of the towns are the villages. If the security of the villages is guaranteed, the towns can rest easy. Therefore, if a defense corps is organized in the villages, it will be of great help to the overall local security. This is reason one why the Houwei Corps is necessary.</p>
<p>Today, when local autonomy is being implemented, local citizens should take responsibility and fulfill all local autonomous obligations. The defense corps can also be said to be a kind of autonomous work. This is reason two why the defense corps is necessary.</p>
<p>In the event of international military aggression, in order to enable the country to resist foreign aggression, we must pay attention to the military education of the people. The defense corps is also a kind of military education. This is reason three why the defense corps is necessary.</p>
<p>Most of the members of the defense corps are enthusiastic local youths who care about their hometowns and are willing to give up some precious time to serve the local area. Because the members have a sense of local identity, they often do not hesitate to risk their lives in the event of bandit incidents and are able to fulfill their responsibilities. This is reason four why the defense corps is necessary.</p>
<p>Based on the above four reasons, the status of the suburban defense corps is much more important than that of the military and police. Since the establishment of the defense corps, bandits have gradually disappeared, which cannot be said to be not due to the efforts of the defense corps. If there are still shortcomings in the system of the defense corps, it should be gradually improved.</p>
<h3>Harm Ala to Death, Cry to Death</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhongyi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. De Ping's "Look at Your Poverty," I couldn't help but associate it with the Jai Alai and the racecourse.</p>
<p>The Western name of Jai Alai is HAI-A-LAI, which, according to common sense, means "harm Ala"! Although this kind of gambling has been banned, it does not seem wise to set up an "atomic dance hall" on the original site!</p>
<p>As for the Western name of the racecourse, RACE COURSE, the transliteration should be "Lai Si - Ku Si" (Come to Death - Cry to Death)! Here, we sincerely hope that the authorities will realize the plan to rebuild the racecourse into a park as soon as possible, so that a "tearful" place can be turned into a paradise that provides fresh air for the citizens!</p>
<h3>The Art of Advertising</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Open the newspaper, and it is full of advertisements; the walls on the road are full of advertisements; on the screen, there are also advertisements; even in your house, sometimes there are green-clothed messengers who send a few advertising letters.</p>
<p>The art of advertising, in a word, is to be attractive and touch your heart.</p>
<p>The medium of advertising can, of course, allow the good to win and the bad to lose, so that good products can be promoted and outdated products can be reduced. However, because too much attention is paid to the promotion of advertising, the improvement of the essence is sometimes neglected, and advertising becomes exaggerated. The line between advertising and deception is as difficult to distinguish as the line between accurate reporting and distorted propaganda. Discerning people naturally understand.</p>
<p>When a new product is launched, people are afraid that others will not know about it, so they desperately post advertisements. When there is a big sale, people are also afraid that others will not know about it, so they desperately post advertisements. The types of advertisements are becoming more and more numerous, and the competition is becoming more and more intense. Sometimes, they wear a solemn and inviolable declaration; sometimes, they wear a humorous joke to attract your curiosity. Sometimes, they use low prices to attract you, such as, "American suits for 5,000 yuan." In fact, when you go there, the so-called 5,000 yuan suits are just broken and dirty clothes thrown in the corner of the room. Sometimes, they use high-quality goods to attract you, such as, "Genuine American DDT." In fact, who knows what kind of medicine is sold in the gourd?</p>
<p>If all the advertisements are fictional lies, then the designer of this advertisement must be the most clumsy guy. Advertising must not lose its truth, but it must also attract people. That is a clever technique. I remember that there used to be a toothpaste whose advertisement was "Has a Su Su sound." People tried it, and it was indeed true, but whether this toothpaste is good or not, whether it is worth it or not, it is up to the user to fill in the answer. This is a good way.</p>
<p>Self-praising acknowledgments, boasting, and introductions, in addition to deceiving people from the countryside, I am afraid that they will not have any effect at all! Who can be fooled by this kind of self-cleverness?</p>
<p>If you say that advertising has no use at all, then of course no one will believe this sentence. But saying that advertising is absolutely reliable is not necessarily true. The main thing is the quality of the essence; the surprising victory on the advertisement can achieve complete success, but it can never make up for your deficiencies.</p>
<h3>Changing Hearts</h3>
<p>— Zuo Zhi</p>
<p>The so-called "people's hearts are not as good as in ancient times" is not necessarily the view of the stubborn faction. These days, people's "hearts" are indeed getting farther and farther away from the "ancient way." Although they are full of "benevolence, righteousness, and morality," they are secretly doing things that are "men stealing and women prostituting." What is hung up is the "sheep's head," but what is sold is "dog meat." It is said that people have received gold bars, foreign houses, and cars in addition to receiving "public property." When they came, their hands were empty, and when they left, they returned full of loads. These people fully exposed their "black hearts" and "cruel hearts."</p>
<p>Recently, Soviet scientist Dr. Xinni Han experimented with "heart transplant surgery," and it is said that he has achieved preliminary success. He removed the diseased heart of a frog and transplanted a healthy heart into it. The frog lived as usual, just like before. Xin also did experiments on cats, dogs, and rabbits, and the results were also satisfactory. Therefore, it is quite possible to replace the diseased heart of a human being with a healthy heart. After this matter is successful, the "heart disease" that poses a great threat to human life will no longer be a concern. In this way, a large part of mankind is indeed "saved."</p>
<p>However, I think that the "black hearts" and "cruel hearts" of the world's jackals and cunning dogs who seize and plunder should be "changed" first. I think that only in this way will mankind be truly "saved."</p>
<h3>Don't Abuse Vitamins - Too Much is as Bad as Too Little</h3>
<p>— Yang Yongzhang</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese people's knowledge of vitamins has gradually become richer, especially those wealthy people who live in big cities, who pay more attention to vitamins, thinking that all health and happiness seem to be buried in vitamins. Smart businessmen are, after all, good at making money. They understand the principles of economics and can cater to the wrong psychology of many people, so vitamin pills and injections have emerged at the right time. People are blindly abusing vitamins with their eyes closed. They simply do not understand the nature and efficacy of vitamins (of course, referring to the simplest ones), and only know how to blindly take pills and injections.</p>
<p>I do not deny the value of vitamins. Take vitamin A, for example. It can indeed help development, increase nutrition, and prevent xerophthalmia, night blindness, and other infectious diseases. Lack of vitamin A can cause the above-mentioned diseases, and children are also prone to rashes, scarlet fever, and other diseases due to reduced resistance. Human cells atrophy and die due to vitamin deficiency, and many neurodegenerative diseases are also related to vitamin A.</p>
<p>The amount of vitamin A required by the human body per day is about 4,000-8,000 international units, but we do not need to take pure vitamins separately (when we are not sick) because we have already obtained sufficient amounts in meat, fish, and vegetables. The liver in the body can indeed store a large amount of vitamin A, but there are certain limits. Too much vitamin cannot be stored in the body. After being absorbed by the digestive organs, it must be excreted from the body in the urine through the kidneys. This is of no benefit to the body.</p>
<p>Vitamin A is like this, and so are other vitamins such as A, B, C, D, E, F, I... etc. We must never abuse vitamins and neglect other self-cultivation. Many people swallow vitamin pills and injections, and then do not take good care of their bodies, thinking that vitamins can "eliminate all diseases" and "prolong life." This is harmful to vitamins.</p>
<p>Medical advances have confirmed that "hypervitaminosis" is as harmful to the body as deficiency. This is as terrible as poisoning by other drugs. For example, vitamin D, everyone knows that lack of it can cause rickets, but taking large amounts can lead to joint stiffness, vascular hardening, and kidney stones, which can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone can use vitamins reasonably, neither "insufficient" nor "excessive," and absolutely not abuse vitamins. Many advertisements are often far from the actual effects in medicine, because pharmaceutical businessmen exaggerate and spread rumors for the sake of many people's wrong psychology. Some products do not meet the standards in terms of "quality" and "quantity," which really damages the reputation and belief in vitamins.</p>
<p>Finally, please read the title a few more times, otherwise I am afraid I will have to write another article "Don't be afraid to use vitamins."</p>
<h3>A Small Appeal</h3>
<p>— Yi Ying</p>
<p>On the base of walls near government offices, one often finds phrases like "No urination allowed, violators will be arrested." However, those who need to urinate seem to specifically seek out these places to relieve themselves; this unwittingly creates the effect of "Here lies three hundred taels of silver."</p>
<p>I recall that in the past, during the time when the areas were called concessions, each police station was required to dispatch several so-called "Hong Kong cars" daily to patrol the streets, and when they encountered someone "urinating anywhere," they would impolitely invite you to experience the flavor of a jail cell for four hours, or fine you one silver dollar. However, now that the concessions have been reclaimed and municipal affairs are being managed by ourselves, the issue of "urinating anywhere" has never been addressed by the health authorities.</p>
<p>As reported in the newspapers: Cases of epidemic cholera have repeatedly been discovered in this city. A group of doctors and nurses from public hospitals are forcefully injecting passersby with preventative shots at major intersections. I believe this is merely a superficial solution. The only thorough and fundamental cure is to prevent the generation of cholera bacteria. This leads me to believe that the first thing that needs to be done is to immediately "prohibit urination in public places"!</p>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's New Poem: "Apology to the Water"</h3>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang, who is about to go abroad to study hydraulic engineering, wrote a "new poem" titled "Apology to the Water" on the banks of the Jialing River before his departure. The original text is as follows: "The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward day and night, its uses are boundless, but we do not use it fully. Buoyancy can carry ships, but there are no ships sailing on the river; seven hundred *li* a day, but only one boat can be seen. Lateral force can irrigate, but there is no water in the fields; relying on heaven for food, we have bad harvests every year. Torque can generate electricity, but no dams have been built; few people live along the river, and production is backward. None of the three forces are used, are we ignorant of the water? In this new world, we must catch up."</p>
<p>The Ping Municipality publicly burned smoking paraphernalia confiscated during a crackdown on opium on June 3rd at Dongda University. The opium pipes that were burned were all extremely valuable, including several recently seized from a private residence that were used by the late Empress Dowager Cixi. These items were all engraved with the Empress Dowager's inscription: "Grasping the universe, viewing the sun and moon."</p>
<p>It is rumored in Nanjing that the line "Holding a steel knife, ninety-nine, killing the Hu people before stopping" from the Shao Bing Song (Cookie Song Prophecy) is being used to create an illustration: Ninety-nine is one less than one hundred, "hundred" minus one becomes "white," so when Bai Lexi arrives in the Northeast, Siping Street and Changchun will be recovered.</p>
<p>Before General Dai Li's accident, it is said that a very ominous sign occurred: the roof of "Shu Lou," the Chongqing office building of his bureau, was swept away by a gust of wind.</p>
<p>After Xu Enzeng was released, he peacefully entered the production industry, running a farm in Xiangdong and a Sino-American machinery factory in Nanjing, both on a large scale. His wife, Ms. Gu Xia, is also very enthusiastic about this, running her own weaving factory. Husband runs the farm, wife weaves, no longer concerning themselves with other people's affairs.</p>

<h3>Overturning the Arrogance of the "Toilet Lords" - Over Ten Thousand Yuan Per Night Soil Bucket</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>There is talk that the British Tramways will extend service hours to 11 PM. Upon hearing this news, I not only do not feel excited, but rather feel more sentimental, because if I am "going to commit offenses" for pleasure, then after 8 o'clock at night, I must hurriedly take the tram to the newspaper office. Even if the tram service hours are extended, it still does not allow me to "cuddle" at home for a moment longer.</p>
<p>The health authorities stipulate that the average household should pay 1,000 yuan per month for the removal of ordinary night soil buckets, and 3,000 yuan per month if washing is also required. If there is an overcharge, it can be reported to the sanitation department for strict handling. In reality, as far as I know, the price for each night soil bucket to be emptied and washed is mostly already around 10,000 yuan. However, to avoid trouble, which family would be willing to come forward and report it? Thus, the burden on residents increases daily, and the arrogance of the "night soil lords" grows more and more rampant. This is the same as the difficulty the authorities have in getting citizens to report those who are selling gold bars for houses; citizens only seek to have a place to live, and if the price of the gold bars is within their reach, they are unwilling to report it. The Chinese lack a bold spirit, lack a spirit of sacrifice, and are constantly appeasing. This is extremely dangerous; historically, many events of losing rights and humiliating the nation have been brought about by "appeasement."</p>
<p>Dancing has been banned in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Qingdao, and the ban is rigorously enforced. But when the news arrived, Chongqing, the mountain city, not only maintained the status quo for all dance halls, but organizations such as the Sino-American Cultural Association also increased the number of open-air dance halls, and business is booming. Upon hearing this, Wuling Ren felt injustice on behalf of the dance girls in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places. Only now, after seeing the report that the Chongqing municipal authorities are also discussing a ban on dancing, am I finally relieved.</p>
<p>The Tianjin News reported that Mayor Zhang Tingyu, upon receiving reports that personnel from various bureaus and offices under his jurisdiction had unauthorizedly occupied enemy property and even had relatives and friends occupy it under their names, renting out a portion for profit, was very angry and has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate and is determined to severely punish them. Shanghai has not had similar news appear in the newspapers in the past, but hopefully it will not happen in the future either.</p>
<h3>Gaoyangtai</h3>
<p>— Zhen Shi</p>
<p>Feeling on the Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>The great rivers and mountains, the sentimental past, the departing person can feel sorrow everywhere. Green calamus and red pomegranates, enchantingly another Dragon Boat Festival. War fires are everywhere, the return path is cut off, drifting in exile, suffering alone in a foreign land. Hateful and grand, a hundred feelings before me, the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>For eight years, I endured bitterness and hardship, hoping for the golden crow to mend the sky, and the land to return to its former glory. All kinds of leisure and hope should follow the fleeting waters of the sea. Who would have expected more turbulent times, endless storms, and only desolation. Reason wants to return, yet it's a world away, waters and mountains are distant.</p>

<h3>General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama (1)</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, I have seen almost ten spoken dramas. The performances vary greatly in quality. In some, the director's success surpasses that of the actors, while in others, the actors' skills surpass the director's. And there are even some where the script overshadows everything, making the director and actors lose all their brilliance. I would like to make a general review of these ten spoken dramas.</p>
<p>1.  "Begonia"</p>
<p>I have only seen this play twice. The first time, I went to see Shi Hui's performance out of admiration. Since I was just going to appreciate an actor's acting skills, I was very satisfied and left the theater after watching the play. The second time I went to see it, I was very surprised. Because I realized that the director of "Begonia" did not seriously take on his responsibility; perhaps the director adopted a laissez-faire system. As a result, the actors' capture of the character's image and the development of their acting skills were quite inconsistent. The biggest contrast was between Ding Shan, who played Ji Zhaoxiong, and Shi Hui, who played Begonia. Their acting styles did not follow the same path but were opposite to each other. Ding Shan's portrayal of Ji Zhaoxiong was entirely external, exaggerating his movements, expressions, and gestures, even emphasizing them. For example, in the second scene of the second act, he pointed to the door in the interior and said to Luo Xiangqi, "Begonia is in this room." When he spoke, he struck a bow-like pose, pointing at the door with his finger and looking at Luo Xiangqi on the right, for half a minute. This stage picture seemed very unrealistic! There were several scenes like this with unnatural "poses."</p>
<p>Shi Hui's portrayal of Begonia in the fourth and fifth acts was the most touching. Because he faithfully created a character. He was able to convey to the audience the shift in emotions and the change of thoughts in a moment with subtle pauses. He did not have any special movements or gestures, but he had a wealth of inner emotions. Because he knew that only inner emotions could deeply touch the audience's heartstrings. At the same time, he was able to meticulously use his own conditions to create a perfect image, and use this image—a slightly hunched body, walking slowly, a low and resonant and heavy voice containing a lot of suffering—to touch every audience's memories of his youth. His approach was entirely based on inner feelings. So he was able to perform it so vividly! So real! It can be said that he has a good cultivation and a deep observation of life, so he can always control his emotions and reproduce a real character on the stage.</p>
<p>The director did not unify the acting skills of the actors in this play. Therefore, he did not make the performance of this play complete. It's a pity!</p>
<p>2.  "Hard Work"</p>
<p>The actors' acting skills in this play were much more uniform. Their starting point for dealing with the characters was exactly the same, and all that was left was the difference in the actors' own acting skills. In this play, the most flawless performance was by Zhang Fa of the She Qi Society. He did not have any special actions or gestures that would make the audience like him to show off his skills, but he acted very plainly until the end. But he was able to reveal a perfect character. These are things that a low-level actor cannot understand. The director's responsibility in this play cannot be said to be small, but he did not achieve the highest goal. He just made the play active on the stage. Therefore, the performance of this play felt quite plain.</p>
<p>Especially, the theme of this play was overshadowed by the love scenes, giving it a sense of being secondary.</p>
<p>3.  "Jin Xiaoyu"</p>
<p>Its theme is to expose the extravagance, corruption, and cruelty of the old warlords and corrupt bureaucrats. The director made this play very complete on the stage.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Danny and Shi Hui's acting skills were the most perfect. Danny played the red-light district singer Jin Xiaoyu. She made Jin Xiaoyu's character more obvious, and made Jin Xiaoyu's sincere love for Fan Yongli more undisguised. In the last act, when Wang Shiyi forced her and forcibly touched her hair several times, she was obedient on the surface, but she harbored a strong resistance in her heart. Finally, after Fan Yongli was shot and carried in, she thought he had fainted, but when she poured wine for him, she realized he was really dead! Danny was able to express the emotions in these two scenes very clearly; making the former show the anger hidden inside and obedience on the outside, while also trying to take the opportunity to stab the other party to death. And the latter's panic after killing Wang Shiyi, the joy when she saw Fan Yongli being carried in, and wanting to escape quickly. Once she discovered that the other party was dead, she was completely disheartened and sacrificed herself for love; these emotional expressions were fully introduced to the audience without any reservation. Such a well-cultivated actress has not been found in Shanghai's stage until now! However, her external appearance and voice could not help her reach the perfect realm, which is a pity!</p>
<p>Shi Hui played the old warlord Wang Shiyi in this play, and he was able to express the obsequiousness to those above him and the yelling orders to those below him, and the threats and inducements to the revolutionary patriots. Cui Chaoming, who played Fan Yongli, was also able to portray a character who sacrificed himself for righteousness.</p>
<p>The allocation of actors, the characters they played, and the starting point of their acting skills were very uniform in this play. The director's handling of the play was also very appropriate. For example, when the seventh wife came in during the second act, until she went in to drink, the director clearly let her sit on the chair by the round table. On her right were the three wives, and on her left were the older men, making the whole audience pay attention to her alone. At the same time, the stage surface also had levels and was very beautiful.</p>
<p>Among the three performances of the Hard Work Theater Troupe, the artistic level of "Jin Xiaoyu" was the highest! No matter which part of the script, director, actors, or set design you look at, it can surpass the artistic level of the previous two performances! At the same time, it is more complete and better than the previous two performances. Because theatrical art is a comprehensive art, the most valuable thing is the completeness of the performance, the cooperation of various departments, and the unity of acting skills, which should be determined by whether the director is responsible or not. Because the director is responsible for guiding the actors' movements. The director is a mirror in the actors' acting skills, and should tell the actors the results of the reflection, so that the actors know where their problems are, and then start to modify them, so that their acting skills have the same starting point. If the actors can embrace the attitude that "life is short, but art is eternal" and seriously complete a work of art without adding any small gimmicks, then this performance will definitely be complete! It will definitely be successful!</p>
<h3>Answering Questions About Han Lan'gen's Role in the Play</h3>
<p>— Wu Yonggang</p>
<p>The Jing and Wei rivers flow separately. Clear and turbid are distinct, like different utensils, fragrance and stench are different. Those who are loyal are praised, and those who are treacherous are demoted. This is the heavenly principle and righteous path for maintaining the national spirit. Although Yonggang is not smart, he also understands this principle. Therefore, when writing the script for "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" in the newspaper, he was very critical of the loyal and treacherous residents who stayed on the isolated island during the past eight years, and especially attacked the traitors in the play who colluded with the enemy and puppets, amassed wealth through hoarding, and shamelessly touted themselves as underground workers after the victory, so as to make the audience gain a clear impression, knowing that loyalty and treachery must be distinguished, the loyal should be followed, and the treacherous should be hated. This was Yonggang's original intention when writing. Yonggang has never been one to flatter or show off. Recently, because he used Han Lan'gen to play the role of a "New Shen Bao" news vendor who acted as a tiger's pawn during the occupied period, newspapers have criticized him, and friends have questioned him. Yonggang, in addition to feeling ashamed, will tell the motives and process of that time one by one:</p>
<p>During the occupied period in Shanghai, residents were forced to subscribe to newspapers, such as the "New Shen Bao" and other puppet newspapers. Shanghai residents have personally suffered this. After Yonggang returned to Shanghai, his family also mentioned it. Therefore, he immediately adopted it into the plot, describing a patriotic resident who was beaten almost to death by a Japanese ruffian with a badge of the enemy reporting department for refusing to read the puppet newspaper. At that time, the residents dared to be angry but did not dare to resist. When the enemy announced its surrender, the news vendor was captured by the residents. Some believed that the traitor should be punished by the government. The residents felt that the government might not have time to care about such clowns, so they retaliated tooth for tooth and punished him severely. Yonggang felt that Han Lan'gen's clownish face was quite similar to this kind of character, so he used him to play this role.</p>
<p>Inviting Han Lan'gen to play this role was Yonggang's personal decision and did not accept any orders or instructions from anyone. Therefore, Yonggang should be personally responsible for this matter.</p>
<p>If it is said that the initial motive was to use Han Lan'gen's low-level gimmick to cater to the audience's low-level tastes, then Yonggang does not belittle himself, and dares to say that "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" has its own value, and it is not necessary to seek to increase the film's business value with low-level tastes.</p>
<p>If it is said that Yonggang, due to his personal relationship with Han Lan'gen, intentionally protects him and seeks to get away with it, then ask what kind of character the role in the play is, and what kind of impression it will produce on the audience. Furthermore, even if Yonggang has this intention, will the public's right to report and restrain it be lost because of it? Yonggang, though foolish, is not so clumsy as to take such a great risk. If it comes to personal relationships, why would Yonggang favor Han Lan'gen alone, and fall into disloyalty and unrighteousness?</p>
<p>Before the film started shooting, Yonggang, for the sake of gathering ideas, planned to invite advanced figures from the Shanghai press and cultural circles to test the film after it was completed, so that there would be nothing inappropriate before it was released to the audience. Now, I would like to reiterate the previous proposal. I believe that all of you will not hesitate to offer your valuable opinions at that time. If you all believe that this plot has a bad influence on the audience, then Yonggang will not hesitate to cut it out and pay the price.</p>
<p>Yonggang can admit that this matter was not carefully considered beforehand. If there is any intention to seek personal gain, please file a report, and Yonggang is willing to be charged with aiding the enemy. Knowing me and condemning me, there will be public opinion.</p>
<p>Newspapers have criticized me, and friends have questioned me, all for the sake of protecting the poor domestic film industry. Therefore, in addition to feeling ashamed, I would like to express my sincere gratitude.</p>
<p>Film Criticism</p>
<h3>The Servant Girl</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>The smoothness of the shots is entirely due to the director's rich experience, and the interweaving of the fish-eating scene may require modification for the screenwriter.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin is a starlet from Hollywood's pre-war period who is undergoing transformation. She not only maintains her leading status, but she also makes more films each year than most stars. Her youth, beauty, and singing ability play a big role in this. She is the opposite of Shirley Temple.</p>
<p>"The Servant Girl" is one of her successful films. Her acting has improved a lot, and most of the credit goes to the director. It is said that after the success of this film, she has another film with Franchot Tone, "Because of You," which has already been filmed. It is a colored film, and Deanna's first colored film is a double attraction.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the script of this film.</p>
<p>"The Servant Girl" is a comedic play of changing identities, containing the theme that "class can only exist under normal circumstances." When the male lead Franchot is not allowed to enter the "Gentlemen's Tea Party," he can only anxiously impersonate his cousin who is a maid, which explains the theme very clearly. At the same time, in this scene, we also feel that although a person is usually a "Gentleman," in another role, they are all "Masters." Dressed in formal attire, they are still served by others. The disparity in class can only be distinguished during work hours. By the time of entertainment after work, everyone should be equal. This way of writing the theme is the most difficult and the most valuable, because it does not shout slogans, preach, or teach the audience. It contains a profound meaning in the midst of laughter, and the audience only realizes that this theme exists after recalling it after watching the play.</p>
<p>The construction of the story is a series of misunderstandings. In the beginning, Deanna mistakenly identifies a salesperson as the great composer Franchot in the car. Then, she mistakenly believes that her brother Parker is a millionaire, and each time gives her money is 1,000 yuan (the explanation is also very good, Parker says that his 1,000 yuan came from gambling on horse racing). Later, Franchot mistakenly believes that she is a new servant. Bubble mistakenly takes an elevator one floor higher and meets Deanna. Deanna sings, and Franchot mistakenly believes that it is a radio broadcast. Finally, the whole play ends with a misunderstanding of the love between Deanna and Franchot.</p>
<p>These few misunderstandings are well placed and have the ability to stimulate the development of the play. After watching the play, these few misunderstanding scenes are also the easiest for you to remember. The entire story of the play is based on this chain of "misunderstandings." Originally, "misunderstanding" is also a very good method in the constituent factors of drama, especially in comedy, slightly deviating from logic is not a big deal.</p>
<p>It is only that the love misunderstanding created by Parker before Franchot at the end seems to use too much weight compared to the previous ones, which is not very consistent with the whole play, and affects Parker's personality a lot. If you want the story to develop like this, it seems that a process is missing before this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Among the character descriptions, Parker is the most unsuccessful. The first half and the second half seem like two different people. According to the transformation equation of his personality, it seems that he is still missing a little "small person feeling." After watching this film, it seems that Parker Aubryn is not as good as our Shi Hui.</p>
<p>The male and female leads are successful. For example, in the scene where the two first meet, Deanna is lying under the piano using an electric mop, and the squeaking sound stings Franchot's ears. He is a musician, and is particularly sensitive to sound. This is a delicate depiction.</p>
<p>Also, those five men who pursue Deanna, the screenwriters have also put in a lot of effort for the word "five." In the first scene on the street, five people seem no different from four or six people. The second time in the kitchen is also the same. It seems that five people is the most. If you press the doorbell again, it's simply annoying. However, in the end, when Deanna reports Bubble when she is singing, the five people line up to pass the message, which fully shows that five people are not too many and not too few. It's more exciting than four people and more economical than six people, so I express my full support for this "five."</p>
<p>In the entire script production, in addition to the fact that Parker's personality is not clear as mentioned above, there is still a point that seems to be worth discussing:</p>
<p>A maid is inserted in the play who loves to eat fish. All those who love to eat fish are her best friends. It's wonderful, wonderful, and even more wonderful that her master Franchot doesn't eat fish. This is a very good and novel dramatic material, but in the end, Franchot didn't make full use of this dramatic material in the scene at the "Gentlemen's Association," which is a pity.</p>
<p>The original procedure in the play is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Franchot is successively rejected by Parker and the theater troupe owner from participating in the tea party, and the waiter wants to wave him away.</p>
<p>(2) He begs bitterly, recognizing his maid as his cousin.</p>
<p>(3) The maid agrees, he is happy, and dances with her.</p>
<p>(4) He says to the maid, from now on he will eat the fish she cooks.</p>
<p>(5) The maid laughs.</p>
<p>In these five points, I think the foreshadowing of "loving to eat fish the most and hating to eat fish the most" in the previous section is not used well enough or exaggerated enough. Drama needs some exaggeration, especially according to the previous development of the play. I suggest changing it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original method is retained.</p>
<p>(2) Same as before.</p>
<p>(3) The waiter leads Franchot to the maid, who is eating her fish greedily.</p>
<p>(4) The maid agrees, Franchot is overjoyed, sits down, and the waiter asks him what he wants to eat. He says, "Fish!"</p>
<p>(5) The maid laughs, and they both laugh.</p>
<p>As for dancing, it can still be used, embedded between (3) or placed after (5). If you want to shoot a special shot of Franchot eating fish, you can, and it's better than just saying one sentence now.</p>
<h3>A Discourse on Stage Technology: The Feeling of Color</h3>
<p>— Wenquan</p>
<p>1. The Reception and Feeling of Color by the Human Eye</p>
<p>The structure of the human eye is generally like a camera, with extremely delicate organization. The retina, which receives color, originally belonged to a part of the brain, but later, due to development, gradually moved away from the center. The thickness of this membrane is only as thin as a piece of paper, and under a high-powered microscope, it can be divided into ten layers. The ninth layer contains parallel cylindrical and conical cells, which are extremely important for the reception of color by the human eye. The ends of the cylindrical cells are fibers that reach the seventh layer. The conical cells are even thinner and longer, also reaching the seventh layer, but their number is smaller, only about a quarter of that of the cylindrical cells. The distribution on the retinal surface is such that the layer becomes gradually thinner in the fovea, the central depression of the macula, with only conical cells remaining. Outside the macula, the number of cylindrical cells gradually increases again. According to Mark Liss's research, conical cells are capable of both sensing light and color, while cylindrical cells can only distinguish between the brightness and darkness of light. People who suffer from night blindness usually have abnormalities in their cylindrical cells. Those with night vision in the dark must have structurally different cylindrical cells.</p>
<p>The human eye's sensitivity to light does not result solely from the stimulation of light on the two kinds of membranes. A feeling occurs only when this stimulation reaches the nerve center. These two nerves, in addition to the basic colors of red, yellow, and blue, transmit the color. After receiving the color, the light and dark nerves then inform the hue. This information is transferred to the nerve center, and then the brain knows the color. Therefore, even without external light stimulation, as long as the cells are stimulated and the message is transmitted to the center, one can perceive light and color. Thus, in a dark room, if one cuts the nerves with a knife or passes an electric current, one seems to see flashes of electricity and brilliant green light. Furthermore, even when a person closes their eyes, although there is no external stimulus, internal blood flow, breathing, or stimuli from mental thoughts and fantasies can also cause the eyes to see something.</p>
<p>The color sense and health of the nerves can be demonstrated by example. If a person's eye is struck by a fist, the light and dark nerves will immediately be injured, and the three color-receiving nerves will be disturbed by the impact. Thus, the person will feel a dark haze, and golden sparks will fly before their eyes. These golden sparks will contain fine dots of red, green, and yellow. Furthermore, if a person stares at the sun for a long time, the light and dark nerves and the color-receiving nerves will be fatigued by the intense sunlight. When the person turns to a dark place, they will initially feel a dark haze and golden sparks flying. After a short rest, the red color-receiving nerves will recover, and a red light will appear before their eyes. Later, the green color-receiving nerves will recover, and a green light will appear before their eyes. After that, the yellow color-receiving nerves will recover, and a yellow light will appear before their eyes. From these two examples, it can be seen that cylindrical cells are weaker than conical cells, and that among the three color-receiving nerves, the yellow one is the weakest. Therefore, colorblind people are often blind to yellow, with green being the next most common, and red being the least common.</p>
<p>Colors, due to their different brightness, different hues, different natures, and various historical, cultural, and religious associations, can evoke different emotions in the human eye. These different emotions are the very life of color's existence on the stage. A stage designer who lacks this grasp and knowledge, no matter how clever, is bound to fail.</p>
<p>2. The Warmth and Coolness of Colors</p>
<p>The feeling of warmth and coolness in colors does not differentiate between light and dyes. This knowledge for a designer is as fundamental as knowing the alphabet is for a learner of English. With this basic understanding, one can proceed appropriately and avoid errors. Generally, red, orange, and yellow, which are at the upper part of the light spectrum, are warm colors, while blue and indigo, which are at the lower part of the light spectrum, are cool colors. Green, the intermediate color between yellow and indigo, and purple, the intermediate color between red and indigo, are neutral colors. The feeling of warmth and coolness for each color is described in detail below:</p>
<p>1. Red: The warmest of the warm colors; it can evoke feelings of passion, joy, annoyance, and confinement.</p>
<p>2. Yellow: A warm color; it can evoke feelings of warmth, happiness, brightness, joyfulness, solemnity, nobility, and gentleness, and gives people a sense of spaciousness.</p>
<p>3. Blue: The coolest of the cool colors; it can give people a sense of solemnity, gloom, hardness, and confinement.</p>
<p>4. Indigo: A cool color; it can give people a sense of depth, loneliness, and vastness.</p>
<p>5. Green: A neutral color; it can give people a sense of pleasure, leisure, and new life.</p>
<p>6. Purple: A neutral color; it can give people a sense of warmth, splendor, and beauty.</p>
<p>7. White: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of purity, simplicity, winter cold, and expansiveness.</p>
<p>8. Black: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of mystery, terror, despair, sorrow, confinement, infinity, and night.</p>
<p>9. Gray: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of desolation, gloom, coldness, sorrow, worry, quietness, and solemnity. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cheng Yanqiu to Return to the Stage Soon</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>We recently heard that Cheng Yanqiu will perform "Spring Boudoir Dream" again. It is said that he will also co-star with Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang in "The Fourth and Fifth in the Cave" and "Wang Baochuan." We also heard that he will perform several commercial shows at the China Grand Theatre. Rumors are rumors, and facts are facts. Of course, these upcoming shows need to be performed to be confirmed. However, before the performance, this is good news for our theater fans.</p>
<p>Some people say that if Cheng Yanqiu officially takes the stage, won't he be competing with Mei Lanfang? I say that competition may occur, but it won't be fierce. Because Mei Lanfang has his audience, and the only connection with Cheng Yanqiu is a small part of it. Moreover, Cheng Yanqiu will take the stage after Mei Lanfang's term is up. Even if there is a chance of them meeting, Mei Lanfang's performances will only be occasional benefit performances, so this competition will not be exciting.</p>
<p>As for the competition with Ma Lianliang, that may very well happen, but this time he is likely to have the upper hand because his performing location will probably be China Grand Theatre, while Ma Lianliang's will be Tianchan Theatre. The voices of the old singers inevitably change. Mei Lanfang is a clear example of this. Although Cheng Yanqiu will have a similar situation, he is in a slightly better position because he can sing more Cheng-style tunes. In his performance of "Spring Boudoir Dream," there is often a sudden drop in voice, almost silent, before abruptly turning into a high pitch. While beautifully called "high and low inflections," it is, in fact, a painstaking effort to conceal his age!</p>
<p>Film and Theater News</p>
<p>1. "The New Official Takes Office" to be Staged Soon</p>
<p>"The New Official Takes Office" was previously titled "The Devil's Den" and "Demons Dancing." The story depicts an empty city after our army withdrew, to which the enemy sent a large number of traitors to govern. These traitors include rogues, butchers, old-fashioned teachers, and servants from Japanese homes. Everyone is vying to be the bureau chief and magistrate, like a pack of dogs fighting over a bone. On the other hand, the guerrillas are active, and finally, they attack the city, killing all the traitors.</p>
<p>Now, this play is directed by Tao Jin, starring Zhang Shouping, Zong You, Fang Bo, and others, and is scheduled to be staged at the Lyceum Theatre on the tenth. This play portrays the shameless and obsequious behavior of the traitors to the enemy. It was once banned, but now it can be performed in Shanghai, which is truly a feast for the eyes of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>2. "Dream of the Red Chamber" to be Staged on the Ninth</p>
<p>Zhu Tong's "Dream of the Red Chamber" will be staged at the Hua Da Theatre on the ninth. The play depicts the section of "Dream of the Red Chamber" about Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, which is entirely a story of private affairs between children. It is directed by Wu Zuguang, and the actors are all female. The costumes and decorations are all antique and have a unique charm.</p>
<p>3. Gallery of Hollywood Beauties</p>
<p>When Australian beauty expert Mrs. Robi Stan visited the film capital, she individually interviewed the actresses and carefully observed and studied them. As a result, she believes that the ten most beautiful women in Hollywood are: (1) Joan Gardner, (2) Claudette Colbert, (3) Norma Shearer, (4) Loretta Young, (5) Hedy Lamarr, (6) Barbara Stanwyck, (7) Irene Dunne, (8) Sweet Pandale, (9) Carole Lombard, (10) Dorothy Lamour. Since Carole Lombard has passed away, no one can make a follow up opinion. Mrs. Robi's beauty standards are extremely strict and do not solely focus on appearance. Character, posture, and speech all play extremely important roles, just as General MacArthur is recognized as the most beautiful man in America.</p>
<p>4. The Stage Becomes a Battlefield</p>
<p>The "Loyal Family" of the China Electric Factory is nearing completion. In a scene where the enemy and puppets chase patriotic heroes, director Wu Yonggang, in order to achieve realism, used live ammunition for the machine guns. For a moment, it felt like facing a major enemy. Although photographic techniques were used to avoid danger, the actors were sweating profusely during the performance. After the scene was shot, a part of the factory wall had a memorable trace.</p>

<h3>On Social Organization (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, we know that society is an organic entity that transcends the individual. This organic entity has only one common goal: a complete organization under unified leadership. The individual cells and organ departments within it are not simply the same. Each part assumes various different tasks separately, but they cooperate with each other to complete the same goal. Based on this principle, we can know that it is possible to organize a "United Nations" from the many existing countries, because we consider the welfare of all mankind above each country, and seek a common goal shared by all mankind. To complete this goal, each country may as well divide the labor. However, the reason why this "United Nations" cannot be produced now is because each country only takes care of its own interests and does not consider the welfare of the entire human race. Every country has its own goals, and the completion of each goal inevitably destroys the goals of other countries. The result is still war. When there is a lack of common goals between countries, the so-called "United Nations" is merely an external appearance, and at most is only a tool or smokescreen used by certain countries to achieve their own goals. Similarly, if there is no real common goal between several political parties and they forcibly unite the main figures of several parties in a mechanical way to form a government, such a government will also only have an external appearance, and at most can only enable certain factions to achieve their own goals. In other words, if each political party only represents the interests of a certain group of people and the union of each party does not have the interests of the entire nation and country as a common goal, the unified government they jointly organize is only seemingly united but in fact disunited, and can never achieve the goal of making the entire country bright and happy. If we want the various parties to achieve organic and close cooperation, so that each can do their best to organize a sound government, then they must give up the welfare of their own party or individual, and above the goals of the various parties, seek a grand goal of seeking the welfare of the entire nation and even the entire human race. This is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Since society is a super-personal organic organization, what is the position of the individual in society? We said earlier that the individual is a necessary condition for society, and society is organized and succeeded by many individuals. In other words, the individual is the organizational factor of society. Now let us ask further whether the individual has freedom in the social organization? Many young people are shouting loudly, "We want freedom! We want thorough freedom! We want absolute freedom!" But we say that the individual does not have thorough freedom in social organization, let alone absolute freedom. Because although society is organized and succeeded by individuals, individuals are instead dominated by this organization. The reason is very simple. For example, a school is organized and succeeded by many teachers, students, and school workers, but the behavior of these teachers, students, school workers, and even the principal is controlled by various regulations in the school organization, and no one can act freely. For example, the principal has to go to the office every day, teachers have to teach according to the prescribed schedule, and students cannot attend or leave class at will. Everything is in compliance with the prescribed order. Whoever violates this order may lose his qualifications as an organizational factor in this organization, and he will suffer the exclusion or punishment of this order. For example, several people form a company together, but they cannot move freely within the company alone. But does this mean that the individual has no freedom in society at all? No! It is not without freedom. Everyone has his own will under the social and universal will, but this free will is in line with the universal will. In simple terms, the behavior of the individual is only free when it is in accordance with the social order. But is this social order consistent inside and outside, and unchanged from ancient times to the present? No! Social order in the existing world varies from time to time and from place to place. There is not just one society in this world, but many societies. Even in today's China, we are not yet a complete order, nor are we a unified country, because we can still experience several different social orders. There is freedom under this social order, and it is illegal under that social order. This proves that the social order that represents the welfare of the entire nation in China has not yet stabilized, and the people have not yet figured out how to cooperate with this social order to seek greater freedom. According to our imagination, this new social order should be a democratic China after the implementation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>How does this new social order arise? We can also say that this is the free development of individual will in the old social order. That is to say, in the old social order, a few seers and sages felt that life was unreasonable, and they saw a new order that could better represent the public welfare. So they rose up in revolution to realize a new social order. Then the activities of the individual are constrained under this new order. For example, Sun Yat-sen felt the oppression of autocracy and the unreasonableness of the old etiquette, so he wanted to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The progress of this work has not yet been completed. This new social order needs more people to work hard, and this pioneering work and individual efforts are the expression of individual free will. Therefore, we can conclude that under a certain society, the individual only has the freedom to act in accordance with this social order, otherwise, the freedom of the individual is to overthrow this society and organize a new order. However, this revolutionary freedom is also conditional. First, the revolutionary pioneers must be able to see the trend of greater development clearly; second, they must grasp the real needs of the times. The success of the revolution is built on the welfare of the entire nation and even the entire human race, and not on the emotions of a few people, let alone on the interests of a certain party or faction.</p>

<h3>Tamsui</h3>
<p>— Shi Wanmei</p>
<p>——Dedicated to a friend——</p>
<p>I seem to have seen you before, in a dewy childhood, under a trellis with small purple flowers, we once frolicked together; but why? It wasn't until that autumn, when the northern geese flew south across the long sky, that you held my hand and said, "Why bother to have known each other before we met?" I nodded slightly, smiled, and said nothing, seeming to acknowledge that what you said was right; in the faint autumn sunshine, the bamboo fence was covered with red trumpet creeper flowers, and I wondered why they weren't purple?</p>
<p>That day's sun, even if it wasn't more brilliant than any other, was at least the most pleasing, in my memory. But I never told you this, when we sat by the stove and talked on cold, rainy winter evenings, when we scrambled to eat the cherries in the blue glass bowl on warm spring nights; during the plum rain season, when we strolled amidst the intermittent rain and sunshine, I didn't mention it, didn't mention it.</p>
<p>Why? Perhaps you understand better than I: "We are both too old. If we were children, or girls in middle school, we would never want to casually alienate a friend we liked. Sometimes, people are stingy with giving affection, often more so than with visible material..." You frankly admitted that you often wrote letters but didn't send them. So we are all afraid of being called "unrequited love"! Ah! I don't know, since when? Has indifference become prouder than warmth, alienation stronger than intimacy? How absurd, and how unreasonable.</p>
<p>I remember once, in a letter to you, I wrote the sentence, "I hate myself." Three days later, your reply came, no longer the usual few words, telegraphic brevity. This time, on pale lotus-colored stationery, you reprinted a passage from the diary of the English writer Katherine Mansfield: "A year ago we sat together by the fireplace, she and I, hand in hand, cheek to cheek, not talking, sometimes whispering. The room was dark, the firelight faint, and the sound of the rain outside was very loud. Her frail body was clothed in long black, and a string of amethyst beads was around her neck. Gradually, we felt very cold, so I dragged a blanket from the bed and draped it over us, smiling and saying, 'We are like children on a desert island.' She pulled up a corner of the rough blanket with one hand, and placed the other hand on my hand. We talked about fame, how we longed for it, how we should strive for it. We talked about our plans. I found a blank piece of paper, and we wrote a vow together, resolving to become famous within a year. We signed it, sealed it, and threw it into the fire, offering it to God. The flames blazed for a moment, and then quickly turned into a pile of ashes. Soon she fell asleep, and I covered her completely with the blanket, and gave her a pillow as well. So the long, cold night dragged on. I looked at her, my mind filled with thoughts and desires, but I couldn't fall asleep. Today, in another corner of the world, I am suffering, and she, without a doubt, has already bought a hat in the February market." I was moved to tears; tears flowed down my face. After the passage, there were your own words: "...From now on, I don't know on what day, I am worried that we will unexpectedly compete for a hat in some big market..." I told you, "If one day it really happens as you predict, then I will definitely give you that hat. I have long lost the confidence and courage to compete for hats, especially with you. Even for this letter, I will sacrifice the hat to you." We have had such back-and-forth daydreams, perhaps committing childish mistakes, but they were all sincere. How many sincere words in the world are not dreams, madness, or foolishness? Since we like to say them, and don't hate to hear them, why not just write them down?</p>
<p>I remember someone once said to me, "I used to have the pride of a solitary person, but now I only have the sorrow of a solitary person." What a foolish statement! Because the pride of a solitary person is only his sorrow, and his sorrow is also the pride of a solitary person. Are we proud? No, because we have no sorrow. In this vast sea of people, we still have many friends, and also one or two confidants. You said, "...In the twilight, in the misty rain of dusk, under the starry night, you are most likely to be remembered, because you belong to this world..." Isn't that right? When the scenes of warbling spring, wild geese at night, candlelight, and flute music, all the earth-shattering scenes are forgotten, all the stories of shared songs and tears are forgotten, only you, only you, the most distant yet closest friend, a sigh, as if hundreds of years ago? Or as if in a moment? A half-smile, in front of me, and also on the horizon? It is reality in romance, meaning in unconsciousness, it is the abolition of time, space, and environment... But, at the glittering banquets with fragrant clothes and swaying shadows, I have never thought of you, and you may not remember me either!?</p>
<p>Someone said, "One's life is friendship," so what is our friendship? A friendship of shared life and death is like an epic tragedy, a friend with whom one can talk and laugh and who has compatible languages is like a strong wine, because they are "a thousand cups too few"; but what about us? What is this vague, half-deep, half-shallow, distant yet close connection? It won't be dust? But it's definitely not a rose in the heart; it's a bit like a lightly sketched Chinese landscape painting. So I remembered a sentence: "The friendship between gentlemen is as light as water." I am not a gentleman, but I have boldly borrowed it; Tamsui, in the cup of life, may not be precious, but it is indispensable. Would you like to drink with me? I will use purple tulip flowers to replace the cup of life, and gently pour it and offer it to you.</p>
<h3>On Liu Shi's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Su Dongpo once said, "To judge painting by likeness is to be seen as a neighbor to children." This view, which emphasizes spirituality while neglecting form, refers to the paintings of literati with a highly developed culture, and not all paintings should be criticized according to this standard. After all, painting is a form of pictorial art. The expression of spirituality and the vividness of charm are both entrusted to the image. That's why Xie He's Six Canons mentioned "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (Spiritual Consonance, Life-Movement) and "Ying Wu Xiang Xing" (Structural Method, Bone-Strength) together. Zhang Zhao said, "Learn from creation outwardly, obtain the source of the heart inwardly." "Learn from creation" means faithfully depicting and seeking its image. "Obtain the source of the heart" means seeking the expression of spirituality within the image. Ni Yunlin's "Writing the untrammeled spirit in my breast" merely reinforces the importance of spirituality. After all, the image has an important place in painting.</p>
<p>The success of depicting the image to the fullest is achieved by using the combination of points, lines, and surfaces – what the Six Canons call "bone method using the brush." Whether it is landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, fish, or insects, they are all indispensable. Points, lines, and surfaces must not only be light and smooth, but also be profound and vigorous. Only then can various images be depicted with unparalleled fidelity and perfection. Seeking likeness through realistic depiction, and seeking wonder through brush and ink techniques, Han Gan of the Tang Dynasty once said to Emperor Xuanzong when painting horses, "Of the hundreds of thousands of imperial horses, all are my teachers." He could paint all kinds of shapes such as saddled horses, leaning, grazing, startled, stopped, running, and rising, in thousands of variations, as if they were alive. This is an example of reaching the realm of charm through realistic depiction.</p>
<p>Professor Liu Shi of the Art Academy is a talented artist who started with sculpture and devoted himself to Western painting. During the Anti-Japanese War, he endured hardships in the Great Rear Area and spent his artistic life amidst the smoke of gunpowder. In a difficult environment, he transformed his artistic style, using brush and rice paper to observe and experience real objects, depicting the beautiful postures of aquatic animals. Similar to Han Gan's painting of horses, he drew inspiration from the hundreds of thousands of imperial horses, successfully becoming a rare fish painter in the history of painting, vividly expressing the dynamic movements of various fish such as goldfish and carp on the canvas. He even transparently transferred the most fluid "water" into the painting, giving people the feeling of being on the banks of the Hao River. The maturity of this technique fully demonstrates his skill in the brushwork of points, lines, and surfaces. At the same time, it can also prove that he has advanced from the stage of "learning from creation" outwardly through the image to the stage of "obtaining the source of the heart" inwardly through the spirit!</p>
<p>Long Serial</p>
<h3>Two Birds on the Same Branch (49)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Because Boss Liao, although he has a good heart, has a bad temper! Boss Liao has the temper of a Sichuanese: a small annoyance is met with scolding; a big annoyance is met with beating. The Madam is fierce, but she is somewhat fearful of Boss Liao. Moving her mouth or hands, she is no match for Boss Liao, so her belly is full of grievances, which she can only vent on others. With Liao Dong not at home, it is the turn of the shop's assistants to be unlucky. From the pharmacist to the apprentices, each person inevitably gets nagged at by the Madam for some reason every day. Understanding the Madam's psychology, no one takes it to heart. In the Madam's eyes, these people are not even as good as pigs. She remembers that when she was in her maiden home, raising a pig only required feeding it, and after it was slaughtered, she could earn a large sum of money. But these people, not only do they have to be fed, but they also have to be paid wages, and she doesn't see any use for them? So, whenever she is upset, she shouts, "You group of things that are not even as good as pigs, you all deserve to be killed!" But the assistants would answer her, "We shouldn't be killed, Madam! Isn't that right? You haven't fattened us up! Look, whoever is fat, deserves to be killed!" The Madam suffered a loss! Knowing that they were mocking her for being fat and deserving to be killed; she was left like "a mute eating coptis chinensis" (unable to express her bitterness) and didn't utter another word! Her belly swelled up even more like a drum.</p>
<p>Boss Liao and Master Mo were originally close. Master Mo often went to "Huichuntang" to buy ginseng when he was alive, and was considered an old patron of "Huichuntang." Therefore, Boss Liao was particularly polite to Master Mo, and always charged him lower prices than others. Moreover, when Master Mo sometimes didn't have money, Boss Liao would just write it down as a debt. Later, when Master Mo fell ill, Madam Mo didn't pay the medical expenses, so Mo Sheng had to settle the account at "Huichuntang." It wasn't until Master Mo died that Madam Mo paid off the debt. This time, Bao Ling's coming to work at "Huichuntang" was also a coincidence. Bao Ling was looking for a job everywhere, and one day he heard Liao Dong say that their store needed a bookkeeper. Upon hearing this news, Bao Ling hurried to find Boss Liao in person, telling him that he could take on this position. Boss Liao initially didn't believe him, but seeing Bao Ling's repeated requests, he seriously agreed. They agreed on a salary of food and lodging, plus ten strings of cash for spending money. In his heart, he couldn't help but sigh, "I never thought that the descendants of imperial relatives would now be working as bookkeepers in a medicinal herb store."</p>
<p>After Bao Ling moved to "Huichuntang," he worked diligently and cautiously, and dealt with people carefully. During the day, he sat behind a small narrow table at the store counter all day long, recording every item of income and expenditure. Whenever he had a spare moment, he would study tirelessly. In the evening, he would summarize the accounts, and then hand them over to Boss Liao for review. After the amounts were checked, the day's work was considered to have come to an end. In addition, he helped Liao Dong with his studies. He taught Liao Dong all the books he had read, which benefited Liao Dong a lot, so Liao Dong respected him as a teacher! And he also felt great comfort, because this reduced his loneliness and the monotony of his work. In this family, apart from Liao Dong, he was willing to approach, others all caused him disgust! But he was not satisfied with Liao Dong's personality. He felt that Liao Dong was too young to be sentimental, which was not right! And he was as melancholy as a girl, keeping his grievances to himself, and often covering his face and crying! His small, sunken eyes were always red. This inevitably affected his health! He was thin, with a sallow complexion, and his brow never seemed to relax. The impression he gave was that he was melancholic and sickly! Therefore, Bao Ling often advised this young friend. He wanted to use his own strength and decisiveness to encourage Liao Dong and change him! His situation was no better than Liao Dong's, and he was confident that he had been through it all. He would teach Liao Dong to stand up first.</p>
<h3>Story on the Hillside</h3>
<p>— Zhang Fengyu</p>
<p>This is a small hillside, behind a small town about a hundred li away from Chongqing. From it, one can see the Jialing River making a large bend and flowing slowly; one can also see the bamboo forests across the river, like a handful of grass, and the toy-like houses next to the bamboo forests, lightly placed on the delicate, brown land that resembles the skin of a maiden on the banks of the Nile.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this hillside. As a silent witness, it also knows some – albeit small – stories!</p>
<p>It is spring, the season when rape flowers are planted on this hillside, and these rape flowers have already turned yellow; it is morning, the time when the clear wind carries the music and breath of spring. White gulls are flying over the river, snow-white gulls, so bright they are dazzling. Sunlight strikes their backs, as if about to burst into a long string of bright, silvery laughter. Spring scatters its captivating charm over everything. The rape flowers are bent over by their own weight, and in each of their golden flower hearts, musical spirits are soundly asleep, trembling slightly, waiting for the bees to fly over and wake them.</p>
<p>At this time, a tall and thin young man, wearing a long black cloak, slowly walks up the hillside. Except for his face and feet, his whole body is wrapped in this cloak, and because of the cloak's straight and mournful folds, he looks like a bird with its wings clipped. He stands still, casting his long and dark shadow on the hillside.</p>
<p>He stands there like a stone statue, with the background changing again and again: the light blue sky of the morning, the deep blue sky of noon, the sky of evening adorned with red clouds… only then does he slowly walk down the hillside.</p>
<p>Day after day... the spring breeze caresses his short, obviously newly grown hair, summer clouds set off his tall figure, autumn rain wets his black cloak, until the hillside is already planted with buckwheat, and this buckwheat has already sprinkled its pink little flowers all over the hillside.</p>
<p>On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, he stood there as usual, with his back to the road he came up, facing the river.</p>
<p>The autumn sky is high, and the clouds are light. The crimson setting sun is the center of all colors, and the autumn clouds change with it into countless brilliant colors. The river is also painted with a thick stroke of golden red, trembling in the evening wind along with the river's undulations. Gradually, the setting sun goes down, and the red clouds cool into a melancholy purple, sinking down, sinking down, sinking into the mountain peaks, sinking into the river. Behind the clouds, a little white something appears. That is the moon, but it is still distant and magical, like a drifting dream.</p>
<p>It should be – that young man – going back down the mountain, but he is still standing there, not moving.</p>
<p>The moon comes closer step by step, becoming clearer. The clouds have gradually faded, and the evening stars have opened their bright eyes. The blue of the night replaces the purple of the twilight. The cold current of moonlight pours down on the mountain peaks, pours down on the river, pours down on the buckwheat flowers; the mountain peaks are covered with frost, the river shimmers with silver, and the buckwheat flowers are like a blanket of white snow. The man immersed in this pale blue cold current shivers.</p>
<p>The young man turns around – how pale his face is in the moonlight – wanting to go back the way he came up. Suddenly, he stops, takes a step back, and encounters a young girl coming up from that road.</p>
<p>The young girl also stops. Her beautiful lips tremble, as if saying something. Finally, her voice is heard clearly – although very low:</p>
<p>"...You...it's you...I finally found you...three years...three years...except for leaving a letter saying you went to the front to cut down the enemy, there was no other information...how coincidental...I have you again...I will never lose you a second time...embrace me!"</p>
<p>He retreats in horror.</p>
<p>"Embrace me...come...embrace me...why are you retreating? Why are you avoiding me? Unwilling...?"</p>
<p>He retreats in even greater horror.</p>
<p>"Embrace me! With your hands...with your strong hands that often embraced me so tightly that my body ached...your hands that often took my black hair and made it into your black jade ring; with your hands that often held up my cherry lips, making them into your cup of youth..."</p>
<p>He trembles, wanting to say a reply, but using all his strength, he can only lower his head and use his teeth to bite off the tie of the cloak in front of his neck.</p>
<p>Then, the long black cloak falls down.</p>
<p>She retreats in horror, then kneels down at his feet, saying in an almost inaudible voice:</p>
<p>"What! You have lost..."</p>
<p>"Yes...yes..." he replies, struggling to squeeze out a few words from his throat as if someone were choking him: "I offered them...for the country."</p>
<p>Before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the following year, I happened to come to this small town; that night, I happened to fall asleep on this hillside while watching the moon. The evening breeze painted my eyelids with gentle fingers, ten thousand strands of starlight combed my hair, and the moon played a serenade on her transparent blue violin to lull me to sleep; on the hillside and on the river, a thin stream of light smoke blurred the real world. I fell asleep and had a dream, hearing a small grass next to my ear, in the sigh of the river, telling me the story above.</p>
<h3>The Maker of Happiness</h3>
<p>— Tang Ke</p>
<p>It was a gloomy day with drizzling rain.</p>
<p>At that muddy, dirty street corner, I met you, a newspaper seller who couldn't see the face of the world himself, yet showed the world's appearance to those with clear vision.</p>
<p>I don't know if you live for yourself or for others?</p>
<p>Ah! You, who don't avoid the wind and rain, rely on the bamboo cane that replaces your vision all day long, gently touching the ground along the way, you walk all over the streets and alleys... calling out:</p>
<p>"Newspapers for sale..."</p>
<p>Who says you are running around like this just to prolong your own life? You are guiding those bright-eyed blind people to approach the truth and see the shining light; you are not lingering through your remaining life, but rather delivering spiritual food to the vast majority of humanity!</p>
<p>People accept the spiritual nourishment you provide and grow stronger; but you are withering away in the wind and rain! Who are you doing it for?</p>
<p>I worry that your haggard body, like dry firewood, will soon be eroded by the wind and rain and finally rest underground!</p>
<p>This world is indeed as filthy as the street you are walking on, not worth your remembrance, but when you close your eyes in the afterlife, do you know how many people with eyes but unable to see the world's appearance are still left in the world! Ah! Can you bear to leave them quietly? Moreover, you are healing this sin-filled world, like a healthy person?</p>
<p>It was another gloomy day with drizzling rain.</p>
<p>On that street where I might meet you every day, I no longer see your footprints or hear your voice. Could it be that you really嫌 this world is too dirty and偷 sneakily left the world?</p>
<p>Standing in this dark and stormy atmosphere, facing a world as filthy as a garbage can, without you, the blind newspaper seller who carries the cross of human suffering, I feel my whole body trembling, and my heart is filled with endless melancholy! Why does the world only allow people who harm others to exist?... I can't bear to think anymore.</p>
<p>Ah! You, the deliverer of spiritual food, I bless you, may your soul be comforted. But this unsubstantial support is as empty as a piece of white paper, without generating the slightest strength!</p>
<p>Comparing myself to you when you were alive, I feel my own fragility. How many bright-eyed people can work as tirelessly and brave the wind and rain as you do, running around to create happiness for humanity?</p>
<p>Even though your pupils have lost their vitality, you are still like a sighted person; because you know that being able to create happiness for others is the only way to truly achieve happiness for yourself!</p>
<p>But in the end, you created happiness for others and disappeared into the dark and stormy weather!</p>
<p>Ah...</p>
