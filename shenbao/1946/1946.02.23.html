<h3>重慶學生愛國大遊行　要求蘇軍退出東北　國土與主權不容侵損</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日電〕重慶沙磁區各學校愛國大遊行，參加單位達廿二校，人數二萬左右，於今晨九時進入上淸寺，隊伍之整齊，紀律之良好，勝於往昔。全體高呼口號，羣情激昻，爲陪都學生運動發展以來之新紀元，沿途觀衆滿坑滿谷，對於彩色鮮明之地圖，任人斬割一頭，作深刻警惕。此次遊行之特點，各校敎職員工一致參加，而高呼之口號，亦富於强烈之愛國性，行列過時，民衆均寄予深切之同情，而報以熱烈之掌聲。行列曾向蘇使館及新華報示威，允其在新華日報前有一人高舉以紙做之紅色良心，在隊伍進行間搖動吶喊，意在促使中共趕快覺悟，拿出良心來愛國，行列至小什字解散時，巳十二時三十分矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕重慶市各大中小學學生，以東北問題日益嚴重，切盼蘇聯忠實履行中蘇友好條約，並擴大宣傳，喚起全國同胞注意，確保東北領土主權完整，特組織重慶市學生愛國運動遊行大會，廿二日舉行愛國大遊行，參加學校（學校先後依遊行行列次序）計有國立中大·中大附中·中大附小·川敎育學院·中央工業專科學校·中工分校·國立藝術專科學校·樹人中學·蜀都中學·市立中學·重慶女校·重慶大學·東方語言學校·湘雅醫學院·兵工學校·大公職業校·中華職校·私立新中中學·南開中學·南開經濟研究所·國立造紙印刷專科學校·中正學校·扶輪中學·國立藥專·國立商業職校·國立社敎學院·交通大學·重大理學院·中央政校及中央幹部學校等·中大敎授會·助敎會·重大敎授會·助敎會及各校敎授·職員·工友亦均熱烈參加，遊行行列計兩萬餘人，大隊於今晨八時許在沙坪壩小龍坎集合整隊，五時開始出發入城，沿途高呼口號，並散發五種宣言。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕晨曦初上，記者即佇候化龍橋側，冀得先睹此抗戰勝利以來陪都各校學生繼「一二九」遊行後最偉大熱烈之遊遊行，大隊由四人荷一大牌前導，上書「重慶市各校學生愛國運動遊行大隊」，各校學生依次繼之幷高擎各種大小旗幟，標語，圖畫，地圖及張莘夫烈士遺像，大會糾察組，衛生組同學乘坐自行車，汽車往來巡查照料，宣傳組所置之廣播車，沿途報吿新聞時間，各校員生精神煥發，沿途以悲壯激昂音調，呼喊口號，幷唱「義勇軍進行曲」及「犧牲已到最後關頭」等歌，其中以「拯救東北同胞」，「鐵血保衛東北」「蘇軍必須立即退出東北」及「新疆是中華民國之新疆」，「中共應該愛護祖國」等語，最爲發人深省。路側觀衆皆報以熱列掌聲，并隨呼口號，且有然放鞭砲者，足知此次遊行已激起陪都百萬市民愛國之共鳴。中大附小學生雖僅髫齡，亦奮力參加，與各校白髮老敎授適相輝映，令人感動。大隊遊行歷一小時許，途經牛角沱、上淸寺，中三路、中二路、中一路，繞精神堡壘折至林森路南區，馬路秩序井然，旋於南區公園休息，幷進午膳，三時許經兩路口，上淸寺循原道回校。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕重慶市學生愛國運動遊行大會口號如下：（一）蘇軍必須立即退出柬北，（二）蘇聯應切實履行中蘇友好條約，（三）澈查張莘夫慘案，（四）中共應澈底實行停戰協定中對東北之協議，（五）新疆是中華民國的新疆，（六）國土不容分割，主權不容侵害，（七）國家利益高於一切，（八）反對分化內蒙，（九）不容任何籍口割據東北，（十）我們不能再蒙受第二次（九一八）的恥辱，（十一）蘇聯應尊重中國領土主權之完整，（十二）全國團結一致對外，（十三）挽救東北同胞，（十四）東北是我們的生命綫，（十五）擁護政府採取强硬外交，（十六）國家至上至民族上，（十七）不容所謂「柬蒙」特殊化，（十八）剷除一切非法地方政權，（十九）剷除一切傀儡組織，（二十）絕對擁護政府接收東北，（二十一）擁護蔣主席領導和平建國，（二十二）鐵血保衛東北，（二十三）黃帝子孫們拿出良心來，（二十四）中共應該愛護祖國，（二十五）所謂「民主聯軍」不容存在，（二十六）遵守聯合國憲章，維護世界和平，（二十七）東北問題解次，世界才有和平，（二十八）反對蘇聯一切新要求，（二十九）打倒新帝國主義，（三十）中華民國萬歲等。又衙慶市學坐今晨舉行愛國遊行時，散發下列七種宣言：（一）吿全國同胞書，（二）吿全世界人士書，（三）質中共，（四）慰問東北同胞書，（五）吿東北同胞書，（六）對蘇聯抗議書，（七）致蘇聯史達林委員長抗議書。又中大敎授會暨助敎會發表。（一）致蘇聯政府電，（二）致英·美·蘇政府電，抗議雅爾達秘密協定，（三）上國民政府電，（四）爲東北事件吿各黨各派書。中大救國述動遊行會發表抗議雅爾達秘密協定宣言，重大敎授會暨助敎會發表。（一）致蘇聯政府電，（二）致英·美·蘇政府電，（三）上國民政府主席書，</p>
<h3>學生遊行大會發表　告全世界人士書　呼籲主持正議制止侵略</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日電〕學生愛國述動遊行大會發表吿世界人士書，略謂：我們是靑年，有愛國的熱忱，有純正的良心，有勇敢的精神，我們誓爲中華民國的獨立完整奮鬥到底。繼謂：抗戰已經勝利了，我們的心却蒙上了一層濃厚的黑影，在日本未投降之數日，蘇聯囚加入了太平洋戰爭，我們對於積極參加我們的盟友，當然極表歡迎，不久日本投降，蘇軍即時進入東北，對於東北受降接收等事一力承担，我們深感謝意，中央邦交日篤，乃有中蘇友好協定的簽訂，在這條約的附件規定，蘇軍於日本簽降後三月內撤完在東北的駐軍，但是實際上蘇軍任務早已完成，而一軍遷延，至今逾期兩月餘，不僅毫無撤退之意，且有長久盤據的跡象。同時，極力阻碍我國接收工作的進行，中國軍隊接收東北，本擬由大連登陸，蘇方不准，再改至營口，蘇方旣准，而又生變故，繼而約定空運長春，蘇方又對飛機數目及性能加以種種限制。一方面運走所有東北的工業設備，使中國不能接收，甚且運走牛羊和食糧，致人民無法春耕，百姓難於生存。最近中國派往接收撫順煤鑛的工程師，竟在蘇軍保護之下被人殺害，這是誰的罪過，這是誰的責任。另一方面，蘇方更在東北培　地方武力，樹立特殊政權，醞釀所謂東蒙古人民共和國，由這點事實觀察，就可知這他們的用意和居心，他們侵佔土地，妄想繼據不退，他們製造政權，企圖分化中國，全世界的人士們，請你們睜開限來看看，現在蘇聯對我們中國的種種行爲是不是合法，是不是侵略者的行爲，我們爲國苦戰八年，而結果仍然是一塊破碎的領土，一點不平等的待遇，我們剛打敗了一個敵人，又跟來了一個更强暴的敵人，對我們伸張魔掌，我們愛好和平，全世界主持正義的人士們，我們竭誠向你們呼籲，給我們援助，共同制止侵略者，我們的要求是（一）蘇聯應切實履行中蘇友好條約，（二）堅次拒絕中蘇友好條約以外蘇聯任何新要求，（三）蘇軍任務業已完成，應立即撤出東北，（四）蘇聯應歸還由東北運走之一切物資。</p>
<h3>告全國同胞</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕渝市學生愛國運動遊行大會，發表「吿全國同胞書」略謂：今天我們遊行示威，主要的目的是申說我們國家主權的尊嚴，維護我們國家領土的完整，明白的換一句話說：就是要挽救我們的國家，要挽救我們的柬北，東北本來是我們的錦繡河山，可是今天却成爲任人宰割的屠場，主要的原因，就是蘇聯不肯履行中蘇友好同盟條約，因爲根據條約，蘇聯在東北的軍隊，是「最多三個月足爲完成撤退之期」，並且根據條約，東北應由我們政府接收，今天離簽定這個條約的日期，已經有六個月又八天了，蘇軍仍未撤退，東北是我們的生命綫，我們能吾建立一個富强康樂的現代國家，要靠東北，我們對日抗戰八年，受盡了人世間的一切災難，還不就是一個東北，今天我們抗戰勝利了，有人要斷送我們東北，內蒙與新疆，難道我們就算了嗎，是絕對不能的。</p>
<h3>將主席電賀　蘇聨紅軍節</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕廿三日爲蘇聯第廿八屆紅軍節紀念日，蔣主席業已致電史達林元帥申賀，電文如次：「史達林元帥閣下，貴國第廿八屆紅軍節紀念日，適値我聯合國家戰勝侵略暴力，進而協同努力，重建世界和平之時，余特偕我中國全體軍民，向閣下及貴國軍民敬致祝賀之忱」。</p>
<h3>親搠自由　月內實現　吳中宣部長稱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿二日電〕中宣部長吳國楨今日宣稱：中國報紙在一個月內，即可不受限制，與美國報紙同樣自由。吳氏此言，表示與聨合社總經理古相對全世界新聞自由所載表之主張完全同意。吳氏間提及古及古相致聨合國機構美國首席代表史丹丁紐斯一函內稱，知曉世界時事之權利，必須佐以印行發表之權利，始成為十足的新聞自由云，此函已於二月十日發表。</p>
<h3>新華日報被搗毀　肇事份子警局拘獲究辦</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日電〕今日愛國學生舉行遊行示成時，有一部份羣衆，在共產黨所辦之新華日報營業部門外，張貼標語並高呼口號，當時樓上有人將茶杯痰盒等微小物件投向羣衆，以致激成衆怒，一哄蜂擁入內，將該報加以搗毀。事後捕獲行兇者數人，警務當局刻正澈查中。又民主同盟所辦之民主報，因日前刋登侮辱學生運動文字，今日亦受學生質問，以致遭受相當損失。近日來陪都學生爲東北問題，羣情激昻，顯有擴及全國之勢，而一般人士對共產黨只知有黨有國際而不知有國家有民族，以及新華日報對蘇聯之撤兵始終不提隻字，一味空談民主，同時對較塲口事件，張大共詞之行爲，亦已漸感不耐。今日羣衆遊行時，曾高呼「中共應該拿出良心來」，「中共應該愛護祖國」等口號，並要求政府堅守嚴正立場。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕廿二日下午一時左右，民生路新華日報營業部被人搗毀，茲將詳情探誌如次：當上午十時半至十一時許，沙坪壩學生遊行，行列經過該報營業部門口時，學生高呼口號並於該部玻窗及兩旁牆壁，張貼標語及地圖多份，該路本極狹窄，且在市區中心，觀衆擁擠，情感極爲興奮，遊行學生行列整齊，並由大會糾察隊在該報營業部門口維持秩序，學生行列過後的廿分鐘後，觀衆仍佇立附近，觀看標語不散，突有人將少數標語撕毀，觀衆羣情激昻，上前制止，時有一公共汽車經過，車內乘客高聲呼打，羣衆乃蠭湧入新華日報營業部，警察上前阻止，羣衆呼喊「誰保護新蘿日報就是漢奸」，奪門破窗而入，大肆　毀，將屋內書籍報紙，紛紛拋出街中，街頭羣衆，鼓掌在呼，新華日報營業部主任楊黎原，圖書課主任徐君曼，職員管佑民。潘培鑫，警察局警長張德勝。謝雲湘，警士唐修泰，出而制止，均被毆傷，警察局唐局長及第四分局趙局長，聞訊即率隊親往彈壓，惟羣衆麕集街頭，途爲之塞，警士奮勇衝入，捕拿肇事份子，當又有警長趙炳軒·牛金玉，警士余俊等五人受傷，當場捕獲刁自龍·尹武林·孫少逸·丁右震，史耀江，胡應平，潘興成，余水寬，黃雲賓九人，羣衆圍集，要求釋放，由保安隊强押至第四分局後，羣衆猶尾隧呌囂不已，至三時許，始遂漸散去，據刁自龍等均供稱：因感於學生愛國遊行，激於義憤，參加搗毀。唐局長以該犯等破壞秩序，並負有損毀傷害刑事罪責任，當予拘押，次送法院依法究辦，至受傷人等已由警局派車分別送至市民醫院診治。</p>

<h3>法殖民部長宣布　中法新協定內容　包括法放棄治外法權事</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕消息靈通方面聲稱：中法新的之條款，除由法國宣布放棄在華之一切治外法權外，復將海防港之一部闢爲中國之自由港。法殖民部長繆戴於星期三所宣佈之協定內容如下：（一）法國宣布放棄在華一切治外法權，（二）法國允將海防港之一部爲中國闢作自由港，（三）法國將滇越鐵路在中國境內之一段，售與中國，（四）法國允許充分改進越南境內華人之地位，（五）中國放棄要求華軍駐在越南北部之佔領費。消息靈通方面復稱法國當局正與越南之民族運動領袖接觸，法駐越高級專員達仁里歐奉命於返越後，即與越方領袖談判，準備在並不影響法國物質·軍略·及文化利益之條件下，將越南之內部行政權，移交越人。該方面並謂，如越人拒絕與法方成立合理之協定，則當越北華軍撤退由法軍接濟後，法政府當不惜以武力對付之。</p>

<h3>蔣經國三度赴蘇　雅爾達協定及中蘇間條約　美聲明未允予蘇聨優先權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿二日電〕東北外交特派員蔣經國，已第三次赴莫斯科，討論柬北問題。</p>

<p>閻氏答稱：本省縣市共爲一〇六保，國軍控制六十七保。其中翼境，浮山，渤源，左　四個縣城，係一月十三日下午十二時後，爲共軍所侵佔。目前衝突地帶，在沁縣文水，聞喜，中陽等縣城。目前糾紛不次者，即在實行執行部和字第二號命令。太原執行小組，日前詢問我方意見，答以不違反不折扣的堅次實行，如能實行命令，則毫無糾紛可言。目前東沁沿綫，日日在共軍破壞進擊中。據報：共軍調集各地戰略部隊，集中力量，攻擊破壞。其中並夾有日本部隊。</p>
<p>晉擬具行計劃　兵農合一</p>
<p>（二）勝利回幷後，對於在晉西時代各種政策，有何修改？</p>
<p>閻長官答：商業上取消統制辦法，任人民自由交易。物價上取消評價辦法，由雙方自由議價。各部隊機關幹部士兵，取消每日四小時的生活勞動。各縣政府成立合作指導室，指導各村人民，籌設生產銷費合作社。</p>
<p>（三）今後山西施政建設有何計劃？閻長官答：回省後困於生活，糧沒有，欵沒有，幹部士兵均感生活痛苦。人民因秩序紊亂，交通被切斷，成爲歷史上少有之困難與紛亂狀態。故施政之要，在恢復秩序，整編部隊，調劑食糧，安定民生。今後將計劃自辦水利，已與水利委員會約定，爲兵農合一。由國防工人五萬人，興辦水利。再撥五萬人，建寨鐵道。更用十萬人辦理國防上之重要工業，及其他建設事宜。</p>
<p>（四）政治協商會對省的地位，曾有新的　　，委官對此有無意見？又省區應否縮小？山西省區應如何重劃？</p>
<p>國畏官之答復如次：協商會對中央與地方採均權制，是國父遣敎的實行。至後二問題，我尙央考慮，未便答覆，殊爲歉憾！</p>
<p>（五）關於管理敵僑敵俘，懇治習省漢奸，均有詳明解答，且已在積極進行中。此外，閻長官又提出加强民族革命同志會工作等問題，冀於今後復興事業能途有所推進。（二月十四日寄自北平）</p>
<h3>工業界黃金時代何日重來　不景氣籠罩昆明</h3>
<p>…本報編譯室…</p>
<p>戰時滇省首府昆明的黃全時代，已成過去。昆市曾被淘金者，走私者，和投機家們渴望夢想着當做中國的黃金城，可是在日本投降後，好像在戰時暴發一般，它巳暴跌入不景氣的桎梏。</p>
<p>冒險家和淘金者都在感慨萬分地沉吟着：「當年美景今何在？」人們在那時，做做投機，買賣美金票，安睡一脊，立成鉅富，也往往有此可能。</p>
<p>這些「過去了的好日子」，對於普通一般人，並不覺得這樣「好」，經過八年多，戰爭才結束，他們已經等得很不耐煩。但是，使他們完全失望的是：戰事結束了，他們的『惡夢」却並沒有隨之消逝。和平的來臨，並沒有帶絡他們以安易的生活，和衆所盼望的承平時代追求快樂幸福的光明機會。相反的，生活的困難，即使沒有增加，至少也還同戰時一樣。我們有一句谷語：『跳出油鍋，躍入烈火，」這情形正復相似。</p>
<h3>商辦廠家　受創最為深刻</h3>
<p>日寇投降後，昆明顯已發生尖銳的經濟不景氣現象。當地的工業界，影響量烈。日本屈膝後，日用品價格的暴跌，和市場需求力的慘縮，等於在昆明工業的胸口猛刺了幾刀，許多工廠經不起這些風浪的襲擊，紛紛閉門大吉　據中國企業協會雲南分會一九四五年十一月發表的統計：昆明七十七家工廠中，祗有四十家還在開工，其餘的或倒閉，或停工，這些數字，分折起來，很有皿趣，因為各式工廠，它的主人，種類性質，都各不同。這七十七家中，十三家是中央政府　所有，十五家，才是私人商辦的。受創十五家，才是私人商辦的。受創量深的，是私人商辦的廠家，下面的表，可作一比較：</p>
<p>工廠性質　工廠總數　倒閉數　百分率</p>
<p>國營　十三　五39％</p>
<p>省營　十九　六32％</p>
<p>商辦　四十五　廿六　58％</p>
<p>上列表格，把情形暴露無遺，不需要任何註解。這還是一九四五年十一月的比較數字，兩個月又過去了，事情竟越變越糟。據中國企業協會雲南分會會長徐博士估計：目前昆明廠家已倒閉的，佔總數的百分之九十。</p>
<h3>國營工廠　多數廷離停工</h3>
<p>我們把國營工廠的情形在此更仔細地巡視一下。抗戰期間，經濟部賣源委員會在昆明設立了不少工廠。其中最重要的是：中央電工器材廠，中央機器廠，昆明電冶廠，中央無綫電器材廠昆明分廠，昆明化工材料廠，昆湖廠等幾家。這些不僅是昆明同梁中設備，員工，最優良的工廠，在全國也可算是數一數二。除昆湖廠外，上述這些工廠，有的已經遷離昆明，有的暫停工作，等待撤移或清理。中央電工器材廠已遷注南京，並在漢口成立一分廠。中央無綫常器材廠正在遷往北平途中。昆明電冶廠和中央機器廠兩廠合併。昆明化工材料廠陷入停頓狀態。昆湖廠的開工能力，祇及到以前百分之十。以前的正常產量，每日可達四千瓩，日前衹能產四百瓩。</p>
<p>雲南省營工廠，情形雖較良好，可也被迫減縮產量，並且不得薪給也被裁减，高薪員工和熟練不撙季開支了。裕滇紗廠現在停止夜工，辭歇了不少工人，員工工人都被裁去，廠方雇用低薪員工和女工來代替。</p>
<h3>出籠傾銷　各廠極感狼狽</h3>
<p>目前昆明各廠所處的狼狽局面，大抵由於此中大部份都是在戰時適應戰時需要而成立的綠故，他們幾乎完全依賴軍界方面約定貨，所以這是很自然的一種趨勢，此時中美軍隊一撤一調，這些在戰時產生的工廠，常然趨於沒落。美軍供應處宜吿結束，其結　使昆明百分之九十八的酒精廠和機器工塲也隨之停閉。</p>
<p>許多屬家在戰爭結束之前，以高價買進大量原料，所以在物價暴跌時，他們的生產成本仍瀕很高，這是虧損的因素之一。昆市大囤戶，因戰事突然結束，而大感恐慌，於是日軍投降不出數日，便把大批貨物在昆明市上出　傾銷，因此，市價的慘跌，越發加速。（譯自密勒氏評論報二月號）</p>
<h3>監政改革管見（中）</h3>
<p>— 徐爾信</p>
<p>我國行鹽區械，向有明確之規定，即某區製產之豐，限於運銷某岸，某岸兼銷某某兩產區之靈，彼此分疆畫界，各不相混，宋且定蘭入之法，元復頒犯界之條，禁律綦嚴，沿明迄今，循而未改。民國以來，因地制宜，稍有融通。此種劃地行靈，各右定額之制，蓋以鹽爲民食必需，而產鹽則有定地，非如五榖可以隨地種植，彼時交通未便，爲</p>
<h3>顧全民食</h3>
<p>計，不能不作有計劃之分配，以免過分擁擠與缺乏，具有平衡產銷，調劑供求之深意。惟各地路途遠近不同，（如鎭不舊　浙壟，距塲數百里，與淮　則一江相隔。靖江貼近淮塲，而食浙鹽。因浙靈以鎭江爲咽喉，而以靖江爲蘇常之門戶，藉以攔阻淮私之侵灌）。遝輸難易各別，（如銅山宿州專銷東鹽南引，距永阜等塲，自七八百里至千里不等，但與淮北之海贛爲近，以前由銅宿至海贛，水陸遝輸，均甚困難，隴　路通行後，自以改銷淮豐為近便）。　諸目前情競爭，此項行麼區械，殊有重行劃分之必要。兼之各地稅率輕重不等，鹽價高低不一，（例如淮鹽銷鄂西裏陽，因經過重稅區而須另加保費。浙之杭縣上四鄕，稅率特經，附近四周之地方，稅均甚重）。因而各地鹽之銷額，各有暢滯。但按之法禁，如以甲地滯銷之鹽，改銷暢岸，或以甲區輕稅之鹽，衝銷重稅區，均以私鹽論，此稱不合理之規定，殊有根本改正之必要。現雖已將引岸專商之制廢除，並已採行均稅制，但行鹽區城，似應按照實際之產銷情形，作合理適當之劃分，而以距離最近，運輸最便，費用最低爲原則，庶使某塲之產，以配運濟銷於某岸，成爲一合理而自然之趨勢，根本不發生「並銷』，「衝銷』，「融銷」等問題。但人民仍可自由赴各地購鹽，不受任何限制。鹽業公司就劃分之行鹽區域，規定適當之運輸路線，此項運輸路線，須與緝私機關之稽查線走互相配合，密切聯繫，則塲私，漏以後，運私仍可按線查緝。</p>
<h3>讀者意見　公敎人員的呼籲</h3>
<p>主筆先生：政府　是否已經決定鼓勵怠工？這個問題似乎很可肯定了。因為一切薪水階級，每次意工，便加一次薪。當然我們不能不說是政府和賢方體諒職員的美意。但是對於那些待遇最低的公敎人員，因爲他們忍受困苦，不願意政府為難，忍耐，忍耐，坐等政府公允的待遇。由是政府也就不聞不問，一任他們飢寒。好像暗示他們說：『你們不曾怠工的人們，是不必需要加薪的。若要加薪，除了意工，沒有人睬你的。」是　？這是高明的辦法？因爲如此，大家都恍然大悟，沒有意工的武器，是不行的，這非鼓勵怠工而何？</p>
<p>先生，我們不願意使政府爲難，不願意用武器來威嚇最　敬的政府，不願意拋荒我們的職務，我們却也是人類，一樣需要衣食住行，你想，呌我們怎麼辦？</p>
<p>我大胆的要求：要求政府對我們不意工的，和已意工的一般看待，而且還希望更加優待。這樣，使得意工的人們好覺悟怠工並不是最聰明的行爲。也許可以稍稍减少衰衰諸公奔走調解之麻煩吧！一個公敎人員上。　讀者意見</p>
<p>昆明　湖勝景</p>
<h3>社論　不相信，且再試着看罷！</h3>
<p>「公生明」這句老話。至今依然不錯。「旁觀者清，」也要眞正旁觀而絲　不牽涉自己的利害，纔可一無私念，纔能做到「清」之一字。惟有眞旁觀，纔能公，纔能看得清楚，辨得明白，一涉私念，則本來明白可見的事情一時也會變得糢糊，看了失着。別人說穿了，指明了，仍舊不相信。何以故？「私」之一念蔽之！不相信，只好讓他們再試着看罷。所可痛者，我們中國百年貧弱，八載兵戎，今天正如大病之後，不能更聽險便試騐，重遭大難耳！</p>
<p>我們早就說過，戰後中國將遇兩大魔障：一是外來的變相侵略，二是內在的經濟危機。而此二大魔障，實在是形影相逐，彼此相生。而尤其可慮者，國內還竟有一部分人，內心毋寗是歡迎這兩大魔障之早日光臨，他們以為必在此魔障光臨之日纔有一獻身手的機會。所以要解救這個難關，破除此二大魔障，惟有政府負起責任，挺着肩膀，把政治上經濟上一切事實眞相公開出來，走上眞正民主的軌道，發動人民的偉大力量，執行公正賢明的有效政策，使這些希望魘障降臨者無所施其技。必如此，存心阻擾國內和平者始不敢阻擾，蓄意破壞國際和平者始不敢破壞，居心投機操縱高抬物價者，亦復不敢投機操縱，危害國家經濟。但近月以來，我們只見少數人的逢迎，只見若于黨派的爭奪，只見某種軍隊的割據騷擾，只見東北蘇軍的一再緩撤，只見接收處理的遷延遲鈍，只見游資作果之下的物價暴騰與工潮迭起。而眞正人民大眾的呼腔還是微乎其微，更說不到人民的行動了。日寇投降，人心大快，曾不轉瞬，已逾半年，黃金時代，良機坐失！可是今天當局有否絲亳追悔的心理？共鐵有否絲毫自贖的心理？社會賢達以及一般國民有否痛定思痛從頭做起的心理？我們看了政治協商會議圓滿閉幕以後的半月情形，眞是不寒而慄。</p>
<p>本來，中國的勝利，中國為「四強之一」的雅號，是由偉大的領袖，領導將士們流血苦戰得來的，八年奮鬥，並不容易。訂惜一般人，尤其官僚政客們，被勝利沖昏了頭腦，他們以為快爭權位，快爭物資的機會到了，而國家對內對外的大政如何，卻司不顧。政浩協商震議，國人原寄以無限期望，以為袞袞諸公，無分在超在野，必可為國家民族打算．尤其共黨自稱為人民代表，宜更可放下屠刀。盜匪尚可「洗手」何況政爭？詎知結果則除了空空洞洞的承認三民主義為立國原則和擁護蔣主席為全國領袖而外，實質上並沒有眞正為國家民族解決了若干對內對外的重大問題，共黨軍隊之盤踞如故，東北接收之阻滯如故，物價之暴騰如故，民生之不守如故，官吏的無能，黨派的自私，於是不但為國民所看透，抑且為友邦所洞識。充其自侮自伐之所至，安得不招致更嚴重的外來侵略，更急迫的經濟危機？</p>
<p>目前大家在那裏喊着東北的陰　了，大家在那裏吼着要借人頭來平物價了。可惜我們指出東北早有烏雲的時候，還有人偏想掩蓋，硬說東北是一片光明的園地，不許人民說一句話！可惜我們再要追究投機漲價誰負其責的時候，還有人偏想用揚湯止佛抱新救火的玩意，搪塞一番，以為可以平物價，安民生！明明是此路不通，他們不相信，卻認為頭頭是道。哄着騙着，嚷着鬧着，以為如此這般，協商成功則共軍可以整編，中蘇訂約，則東北可以收回，拍賣敵產，則物價可以平定，而結果則如何？</p>
<p>先說東北問題。明明政府與中共的停戰令裏訂明，對國軍開入東北九省或在東北九省境內調動，並不影響，而何以所謂中共中央者又要求承認東北的民主聯軍三十萬人，同時反而限制國軍開入東北的數量？明明中蘇條約規定蘇聯當以道義及物資之援助完全供給國民政府，而何以又協助所謂「八路軍」「新四軍」等建立起民主政府？而何以又有「東蒙自治共和國」？而何以又聽任張莘夫等竟被慘殺？而何以蘇軍屆期又延不撤退？凡此，都可以看出：東北問題是內爭，同時是外侮；東北問題是共黨的陰謀，同時是蘇聯的詭計！中蘇條約固為雙方全權代表所簽訂，但中國無形中實為雅爾達秘密協定所出賣！中國人在今天決不重演庚子義和團的排外，但今天的中國人亦決不甘心如滿清末季之聽任列強宰割！而平心靜氣的講，共黨今天假借外力以自重，希圖割據遼東以稱雄，無論其目的何在，其心術實已與偽滿之薄儀相差無幾。且溥逆尙為一無知無識之傀儡，而共黨則陽竊民主之名，陰行虎倀之寶。我們老百姓眞不懂。政府為什麼要優容虎倀到這般田地。豈虎倀而外，更有為虎倀之倀者？東北為中國之東北，東北之行政主權應絕對整個屬於中國！東北為國際重視之東北，東北之經濟資源，應由中國根據國父遺教，尋求國際共同開發之具體辦法，而絕不容許一國之壟斷獨覇！雅爾達秘密協定我們不必問，中蘇條約我們亦不願獨守（必須雙方共守，才有價值，否則等於廢紙）。解決東北問題，只須抱定「軍政統一，主權完整，國際開發」十二個字作方針，庶幾無大貽誤。若還有人不相信，只想欺哄百姓，敷衍虎倀，討好強鄰，則讓他們再試試手段的結果，勢非完全斷送東北惹起三次世界大戰不止！</p>
<p>再談物價問題。我們早巳提供意見，平完物價之法，大要不外嚴禁投機，奬進生產，收縮通貨，平均分配。這些平正易行的事，應該毫不猶豫的普遍實行。然而今夭的情況如何？以言禁止投機，則明裏禁暗裏不禁，此地禁他處不禁，口頭罰而實際不罰，支票解款則查而現鈔解欵則不查，如此枝枝節節，鷄零狗碎的做法，其結局則各地物價飛漲，必成追蹤的狀態，各種物價上騰，必成賽跑的形勢。以言獎進生產，則拍賣工廠但求高價，而何時可以開工，不問也；調解工潮但祇加薪，而資方能否負擔，勞方技術如何，不問也；有利之事官辦，易辦之事國營，燃料必須統制，申請不易買到，而民間游資之毫無出路，以致別尋蹊徑，不間也；土地徵稅，原料徵稅，成品徵稅，資本徵稅，營業徵稅，盈利徵稅，轉讓徵稅，租賃徵稅，重重稅斂，層層手續，苛雜至於不可勝數，而成本之高，束縛之嚴，又不問也。這樣做法，而要希望人民樂於投資生產事業，那個會來？以言收縮通貨，則行政機構壘床架屋，衙門冗史盈千累萬，公教人員叫苦連天，國庫開支幾乎全仗發鈔，尚且不夠，分債聽其漲漲，而絕不考慮另發新公債；黃金聽其狂跳，而未嘗老慮黃金之無限出售，抑或收歸國有；明為嚴查支票之交換以示信用之緊縮，而銀行交換之現鈔則絕對放任，於是人民競提現鈔以爭購黃金與物資而不願再存欵於銀行。…諸如此類，均與收縮通貨之旨，背道而馳。以言平均分配，則消費合作之組織，未受社會之重視，不僅未被重視，即提議亦少聽見；採辦則各自爭購；商品則競相國積；米糧布疋則待價高而後放出，平價則按市折扣，排班擠買，轉瞬宣告售完，而實際乃落於套買市儈之手。社會縱有貨物，遂未必能為平民小戶養家活口之資，而轉為變相商客居奇發財之具。如此，則物價又安得而不步步狂漲！所以，由今之道，無變今之俗，則當局就使天天高唱抑平物價，而物價之上漲必如故。這不是揚湯止沸抱薪救火是什麼？再說句笑話，這不是市塲在和當局開玩笑，乃是當局在有意無意之間與平民小戶開玩笑！</p>
<p>人苦於不自知！現在的大員們眞太自信了！他們有些不相信公正輿論的力量，不相信國際正義的後援，不相信人民的狂呼慘叫，不相信學奢的直言　話，他們祗以為自己的辦法都做對了！他們不自知，且再試着看罷！</p>

<h3>怎樣抵制瘋狂的投機賣買</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　蒼龍</p>
<p>黃金叩二百萬關，美鈔二千六百五十元，白粳喊過三萬二千元，……其他一切的一切，都是沒理性瘋狂的直綫上漲！天天演出那如火如茶的一頁！日日創造着重重的新高峯！</p>
<p>經濟學家們動腦筋分析　結，說這是政治環境不安定，國際關係微妙化，外匯率不頒佈，通貨膨脹，運輸困難，物資供應缺乏，生產未復原，投機操縱，囤積居奇……這一連串聽得熟爛的論調，依舊解次不了投機市場一再在漲的啞謎！</p>
<p>京滬</p>
<p>區財政金融特派員陳行氏說：我們是執行命令的機關，我們天天把此間財政金融的動態，彙報重慶中樞常局和市政府，聽候核定處理辦法，一方面我們儘力就管轄範圍所及，採取必要的措置。</p>
<p>談到</p>
<p>重慶中國銀行日前停止出售黃金的事，陳特派員說這個舉指，並不是停止出售黃金，只因是發售的時候，購買的人比較擁擠，秩序紊亂了些，所以臨時停售，等設法改善後，再繼續發賣，這給神經質的上海市場，製造了一個刺激因素，再其次，最近東北情况的黯淡，也有刺激人心的作用，說到這裏，他舉了個例子：最近因爲國際關係的錯綜迷離，一向下游的紐約股票市場，近來也透露了秀色。　末了，他說他在等待着中樞當局的命令，好讓他遵照着辦理一下！</p>
<p>財政</p>
<p>特派員公署出來，又跨進糧政特派員公署的大門，楊特派員錫志，剛在前天淸早飛南京，此行目的，是在跟糧次龐松舟等會商糧政緊急處置，記者承該署某高級職員接見，曾問到日來糧政處雖一再向米市場貶價拋售蕪秈，爲會不見米商把貶價蕪秈公開發售。更微聞糧政處前以八九千元一石拋售予米商之大批蕪秈，至今仍存倉未曾應市，是否可强制承購是項貶價蕪秈的米商，加就合法的利潤後，火速提出應市。他說楊特派員這次去京，和龐次長會商，一定有很好的緊急措施。記者所提到的種種間題，他相信新措施中一定有改善的辦法。</p>
<p>昨天</p>
<p>早晨起，警局奉命派員到證券交易所大樓，挨戶通知各證券字號，拆除對請電話。要不邀行的話，將由公用局强制拆除。十一時左右，七樓上有人做債市，一片蓬勃氣，市面是有求無供的一面倒，忽的來了四個巡警，做交易的給抓去了四五人。昨天起行總臨時緊急措置，把麵粉貶價六千元一袋，澈底無限制的拋售，人心鬆軟下來，麵粉止漲轉跌。糧政處又在米市塲發貼緊急文告，限制非業中人入場交易，市場門禁森嚴起來……道不能說當局對投機市場毫不干涉！</p>
<p>可是</p>
<p>街頭的擦鞋匠，却昂着頭對記者充份自信地說：這八年的戰爭，給他唯一的敎訓，是要丟鈔票，藏物資！黃包車夫向記者論價時，又翻出他那套討價八股：「米要三百塊一升呢！你知道不？」馬路邊上排門貼着「整理內部暫停數天」字條約店家，又漸漸地多起來。金鋪子裏店夥們，個個懶洋洋地倚着櫃台天。一個穿土布的鄉下人，腰邊纏着隆起的錢包，凑上去懇求似的請發賣個小戒子，店夥揚出道貌岸然的姿態說：我們奉公守法，不做交易。米鋪子裏的米，好壞只剩一種，要不要由你……這舉不盡的一切，也是事實。</p>
<p>記者</p>
<p>不禁茫然？勝利究竟會否光降上海？五百萬市民爲勝利所付的代價，似乎不能眼巴巴地單呌樂園裏的冒險家給搶去！看樣子中樞當局不會沒有緊急措置的，但這措置要來得迅雷不及掩耳，這一棒要打得澈底，務使上海成爲眞正永久的樂園。</p>
<h3>電訊工潮迄未解決　昨呈膠着狀態　全國官商電停頓兩小時</h3>
<p>交通部上海電信局怠工風潮，延至昨晚六時止，仍呈膠着狀態，迄未解次。軍電·新聞電·及氣象報告，於下午一時至三時，曾一度一律停止。但三時後，仍繼續維持。不午六時職工又召集全體大會，共同討論遣派代表，續向局方請求。雙方若能接近，則可隨時恢復工作。</p>
<p>報業糾紛申請仲裁</p>
<p>本市報業工友因要求提高待遇，與館方發生爭議，經社會局召集勞資雙方調解二次，終因　給基數問題，雙方距離過遠，未能成立協議，遂宣告調解不成立，結果由社會局議定基數爲四十五照工人生活指數升降結算，調解議定書已送達勞資雙方，惟館方對於社會局所議定之基數，仍感過高，不堪負担，已申請市政府仲裁。商務印書館工潮，刻已全盤解決。昨晨九時起照常營業。</p>
<p>棉紡工潮情勢擴大</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕三四兩區棉紡織業工潮，牽織業工潮，勞資雙方無法接近，勢成僵局。昨日上午九時起，兩區內五十餘廠，先後怠工，參加之工友達七萬餘人，社會局今日將再調解　其他各方勞資間糾紛，及發生怠工者…計（一）英商上海煤氣公司職工，要求改善待遇，呈請社會局調解。結果對於工作時間及例假給薪兩問題，已獲得協議。（二）中航公司機械人員，於昨日下午怠工，要求公司當局將生活費調整至水平綫。（三）民生實業公司上海分公司全體職工，因要求改善待遇，前日一致怠工。所有在滬航輪，昨均未開出。昨日下午，雙方代表賡續會商，結果意見已見接近。。戈登路澳門路口申新九廠工人要求增加工資未遂，昨日全體怠工。</p>

<h3>證交對講電話被拆除　烚赤喊價仍漲　美鈔又爲投機目標</h3>
<p>烚赤昨交易進行更爲詭秘，人心因國際局勢愈演愈烈，惶恐萬分，買風仍熾，當局查禁更嚴，僅有少數號家從事賣買，游資傾注外幣，烚赤高後已轉入盤檔，大勢已不若美鈔之生動，查晨開已躍升至一八五萬左右，最高哄到一九五萬左右，趁高頗有斬多及套購美鈔之流，曾回挫至一八二萬，午刻約一八八萬，較前收再漲二十三萬，午後遂漸四挺，惟喊價及交易殊爲混亂，先見一九三萬左右，後以拆除對講電話，查禁更進一少，退至一九關邊，飾金無市，紋銀躍升至二千元，銀元曾升至一千二，最後一千一，喑拆自一角八至二角半。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔受金市狂跳之刺激，上塲即被帶好，一部份游資對金市漸露倦意，美鈔遂首被垂青，同時美棉以及物資結款源源需要，盤旋而漲，對黃金套頭自晨初七五〇元對十兩逐步軋　至七百元略強，晨開憶躍升至二五〇〇元以上，結款殷勤，粥少僧多，步漲到二七五〇元，而後被金市帶小至二六五〇元左右徘徊，午後又復升至二七〇〇以上，結果較前收再漲三四〇元，港票亦受結款方面波及，老貨升至四三〇元左右，結果漲起六十元，新貨除被老貨帶俏外，另有投機幫青睞，亦漲十八元。</p>
<h3>流動集會下　證券依然狂跳　聞業中已有人被捕</h3>
<p>公債仍遭零星游資所吸納，初平繼堅，高後因查禁更厲，稍形回降，丙種自一七二〇元步升至二〇八〇元，最後一九五〇元以下掙扎，結果甲乙丁各好二三〇元，丙種升二〇〇元，戊種二五〇元，華股昨有流通性之集會，永紗自二五〇〇元狂跳至三〇〇〇元關邊，美亞自二二〇〇元升至二四〇〇元，景福自一三〇元升至一四七元，而後聞業中有人被捕，急切回小，大股回跌一成餘，小股跌落半成左右，但較前收仍形猛騰二成左右，外股亦被帶好一成牛至二成，但交易寥寥，不逮股債頗遠。</p>
<h3>紗花布買氣沸騰</h3>
<p>昨日紗市瘋狂上升·目開市迄收聲，在人氣沸騰中，買氣極盛，廿支紗各牌漲十五萬至廿萬，四十二支亦跳卅萬，綜觀收盤各支紗綫價格普遍漲起一成半至二成之譜。</p>
<p>布市騰踔如游龍，允以坯布市况迭見喊高，色布售盤如藍布等僅敷白坯成本，染工則等於奉送，廠號目覩此狀，扳價特緊，客帮雖有吸胃，欲進無從。</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易較爲减色，惟市價頻俏，執貨者扳價奇緊，是以買賣雙方談判難於接近，故成交稍稀，價比上日又漲三五千元。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽昨戰　梁溪敗於華南　中一勝V隊一球　女子靑聯勝强華</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽昨循例自下午五時半起，舉行三塲，雖未見精彩，但以各隊之實力，相差不遠，以故愛好欣賞之球迷，頗不乏人。比賽過程，亦稱緊凑。</p>
<p>女子組靑聯勝强華，未見費力，靑聯進步奇速，前鋒楊堅·柳惠珊·徐佩珍俱有射籃功夫，獲分累累，上半時以三八對一九佔前，下半時强華擬圖反攻，曹曼媞振作異常，但終難挫青聯之活躍，終結果五六對三〇，靑聯擊敗强華。繼之甲二部中一與V隊戰，雙方有爭脫殿軍之氣味，戰來緊張異常，中一王金浩董紹唐時來運來，有投必中，節節領先，V隊徐少民大爲賣力，緊追於後，上半時二〇對一八，下半時局勢依然，分數始終相差在一二球之間，中一終以三九對三七告捷，V隊慘敗。末塲甲一部華南對梁溪，華南昨何金貴不到，攻勢銳减，梁溪乘際而入，陶榮石之射，卓國榮之猛，頗見出色，上半時乃以十四對十一贏華南，下半時華南李瑞雄威風八面，遠射近托，均有成就，終以二十九對二八勝一分，梁溪慘遭敗北。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>婦女與家庭</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>婦女與家庭的關係，向來似乎比男十密切得多。雖然單靠女人，沒有男子，也不成其爲家庭，但是因爲傳統的習慣是女子主持家政，男人出外工作，所以『婦女』與『家庭』這兩個名詞，便很自然地連在一起。</p>
<p>可是家庭中的婦女，千萬不要以爲除了家庭以外，社會上和政治上便沒有婦女的地位。社會是由很多的『個人』而組成的，而在理論上女界却佔了全世界人數的一半。至於政治舞台，過去婦女涉足的比較少，然而近年來各國婦女取得投票權以後，往往表現了左右政治的力量。二次大戰以後，法國婦女得到選舉權，結果女界取得三十二個議席，全國投票的人數，婦女也超過男子。日本婦女最近即將得到投票權，據估計有投票權的日本婦女，也以超過男子的數目，可見女界的政治潛力極大，女界同胞千萬不要看輕自己的力量。</p>
<p>衛生</p>
<h3>養成兒童衛生習慣</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>『衛生』這一名詞自輸入吾國以來，已有好幾十年了。由於文字，口頭以及行動（如市政常局的親自執帶掃街等）上積極的提倡，宣傳，因此上自智識階級，下至販夫走卒，差不多人人知曉，而引爲口頭禪，甚麼「衛生醬油」，「衛生乳腐」，甚至那些紹興老官在街頭巷尾喚賣豆腐乾，在五香或蔴茹的頭銜上，也要再頂上「衛生」兩字；至於那些食物究竟是不是「衛生」，那訊有天曉得了！時常里弄中陰溝裏或圾垃箱外邊有人傾倒了垃圾，糞便，給旁人或管弄人等瞧見了，問「儂衛生曉得哦」？唔，「衛生」那一個不懂，祇是峭們中國人懂以管懂，實行是另外一件事，在知與實踐之間是有着很大的距離的。</p>
<p>不但在下層社會中是如此，就是受過敎育，對於「衛生」的意義有相當認識的中，上階級，也很多是如此的，隨地涕吐，便溺，丟垃圾等的惡習以及表現在其他，衣，食，住各方面的種種不衛生的現象，並不比一般下層階級少和好了多少。曾有一位朋友告訴我：他行中的買辦先生當他躺在搖椅內跟洋人談話時，往往喀出了痰，祇把頭偏一偏，就往地上吐去了。我的朋友在旁看了，混身慚愧不安，但那買辦先生却神色自若，恬不介意！雖然吐痰的不是我朋友自已，然而他覺得他也分擔了這份恥辱，因爲他跟買辦先生同是中國人！</p>
<p>細究一下他們所以知而不能行的癥結所在，却是在他們的沒有衛生習慣；因爲他們自幼處於傳統的不衛生的家庭環境中，父母們沒有敎養成他們衛生的習慣，到了長大時，雖然有了衛生常識，無如懶惰，隨便的習慣已成，要他們遵守衛生規則，簡直是叫他們受罪了。他們認爲這些衛生規則祗是書木上的理論，高調，是不能在現實的環境中實行的，「人家都是如此，我也不便例外。」「要隨時隨地行這種衛生規則，未免太麻煩了。」的確，一個沒有這種習慣的人，要他時刻留意遵守衛生規則，實在是一件太吃力的事。</p>
<p>所以，我們要有合乎衛生的生活，僅僅是懂得衛生的意義是不够的，必須同時要有衛生的習慣，而這一習慣的養成愈早愈妙，因爲年齡愈稚，可塑性愈大，習慣的養成愈易而愈深固，如果等到有了不良的習慣再圖矯正，這就像一張白紙上已繪上了不規則的綫條，用橡皮擦去了，再繪上有規則的綫條一樣，那有規則的綫條不能顯得深刻明晰了。當嬰孩一生下來就要保持他們身體上的清潔，乾爽，開始養成他們皮膚觸覺的淸潔習慣。大了一點時，便要時常給他們洗手，擦鼻涕等。到了孩子懂事的時候，更要敎他自動的洗·擦，—你也許覺得你替他洗擦要比他自己洗擦來得省事，但是你次不可以這樣做—和使他們認識甚麽是淸潔，甚麼是骯髒；吃東西時不許用手拿濕膩的東西，如果手上沾了油膩，糖汁，鹹鹵，必須立刻洗凈，否則不可讓他東拉西扯，更不可讓他搔頭摸耳，有許多孩子的皮膚病都是如此釀成的—身體上沾了不潔的東西，往往我們眼睛雖是看不出什麼，但孩子敏感的皮膚却便要感受到刺激，引起搔癢，因搔癢而使皮膚破碎，於是病菌就乘隙而入，甚麼瘡　，疥癬之類由此生成了。</p>
<p>孩子長到了相當年齡而有了相當的體力時，便要敎他們自己洗滌手巾，衣襪之類和灑掃拭抹等，一則藉此養成他們的清潔習慣，二則可學習勞作，練習體力，日後不致依賴傭僅，有少爺　小姐脾氣。其餘如早起，早睡，準時進食，按時如厠，時常沐浴，更換衣服，不隨地涕吐，便潮，丟垃圾，咳嗽，打嚏時泡首或以手帕掩口，不用公共的手巾，杯盤等等良好的衛生生活的習慣，都要從幼年敎義成功，那末，習慣成自然，成人後便能隨時隨地遵行種種衛生規則，而無需運用意識力來控制。不但他們自身因此而享受健康的幸福，保持了整潔有禮的容止，同時更不致妨害到他人的衛生和健康。</p>

<h3>夫婦間的爭吵</h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>夫婦間的爭吵，是不能避免的，有許多人以爲家庭間發生了爭吵，那末什麽事都完了，其實這並不與事實相符。有一位赫勃德先生，曾在美國婦女家庭雜誌上撰文，說一對夫婦如果相處二十五年而沒有爭吵，那末他們就顯得沒有精神，與其說爭吵是一切事情的結束，無寗說爭吵是一切事情的開始。</p>
<p>因爲在爭吵的背面，一定有着相當的問題，這些問題，正期待着解次，如果得不到解次，那末一直容忍下去，就產生更深的痛苦。</p>
<p>同時，如果夫婦兩人，爲着避免爭吵而一味敷衍，未免近於虛僞。一對夫婦，要有幸爾的生活，絕對不能虛僞，所以有什麽問題必須提出討論時，儘不妨加以討論，甚至由討論而爭吵，但爭吵過後，就可以得到解次的方法。</p>
<p>所以夫婦間的爭吵，可以分爲積極的和消極的兩種，積極的爭吵，是以問題爲中心的，在爭吵過後，就可以得到解次，消極的爭吵是一種無禮取鬧。</p>
<p>在爭吵的時候，一方面是進攻者，另一方面是反抗者，這反抗者實在負有一種道德上的責任，那就是說他應該分拆對方的爭吵，是不是由於病痛，刺激，或神經不安，如果由於這些原因而發生爭吵，那末就要有一點容忍的功夫，使爭吵可以在最短的時間中平息下來。</p>
<p>通常爭吵可以分爲三個階段，第一個階段，是開始，在開始的時候，祗是一種輕微的爭論，但若不能終止，那末就要進入第二個階段，就是劇烈的爭論，包括諷刺等，往往在晚上發生爭吵，過了一夜，因爲精神比較安愉，空氣就會綏和的，所以第二個階段，可以短至幾分鐘，長至幾小時，完全要看當事人的情形而定，第三個階段，是結束的階段，無論什麽事，都有結東的一天，即使國際的戰爭，也有結束的時候。在一度爭吵之後，任何一方，都希望言歸於好，那時候，祗要有一方認認虧一點，就可以使爭吵結束。</p>
<p>所以爭吵在家庭間旣然是不能避免的事，我們就要知道爭吵的過程，而加以適當的處置。（本文係摘錄徐百益先生在靑年文化電合學術講座所講家庭問題）</p>

<h3>家庭烹飪學校</h3>
<p>— 綺紅</p>
<p>王丁秀珍女士自從畢業中西女中後，即赴美哥倫比亞大學，以求深造，當時因發覺家政對於婦女一生關係的重大，遂悉心研究。返國後曾擔任母校及震旦女子文理學院烹飪一科，因有一般學生力求課後敎導，就創設家庭烹飪學校，設在上海大興路（辣斐德路馬斯南路口）高　坊四號。敎導中西各式菜餚和點心的製法，最初加入的學生祗有五個，逐漸增加到了目前已經有一百多人。學生可分三種：一種是高中或大學的女生，一種是職業婦女，另外一種是家庭主婦，全校共分五班，每班的廿五人左右，上課時間是選大部份學生最方便的時候，每次上課自二小時到三小時。上課時先由王太太講述將要實騐的名目，煮法，和所要用的東西，然後由學生自動的，按法烹調。由她從旁隨時爲指出各種烹飪成功的訣巧，以及各種失敗的弊病，特烹調完畢，全班同學共同分貪，然後再依人數平均分配那一次實騐所用的費用。所以興趣是非常濃厚。</p>
<p>王太太以為即使在二十世紀，科學昌明的時代，婦女們還是應該回到廚房裏去的。她說：祗要看歐美各國的結女，可以說是沒有一個不會烹飪的，這就是婦女與廚房不罷分離的明證。照現在的社會而言，專門從事於事業的職業婦女，佔極少數，而百分之九十以上仍屬主婦，一個身爲主婦的，都希望她的家庭是一個充滿了喜樂和幸福的地方，而一個快樂的家庭，健康是首要條件，要使一個家庭健康，最應注意的一項便每日必需的飲食。</p>
<p>一個賢能的主婦，必須懂得一怎樣去使她的丈夫感到家庭所給點心，必須要有極好的安排，這樣他便會感到滿意而不致在外胡快，而對于工作，會產生更大的興趣。所以烹飪直接能帶助主婦，組織一個健康快樂的家庭，間接亦有助于社會國家，因爲健康的家庭，才能產生有爲的靑年。</p>
<p>她又說，我國大多數的主婦，她們忘記了她們應盡的責任，終日祗知交際，聚賭，對於家事，實可說是一竅不通。把自己的子女，不是交給僕婦管理，便是送進學校，至於他們平日在校的品行和成績，一槪不管，他們以爲敎導她們子女的職任，是應該完全由學校担任的，這種錯誤的觀念，使她們的子女，失去了最重要，同時也是學　貴的家庭敎　。這種疏忽的結果，造成了種種的罪犯，毀滅了無數的青年。因此，她有一個計劃，即是常她能够把　蘭路俄人强佔的一所房子收回之後，她不單預備擴充烹飪一科，且要增設縫紉以及兒童敎育等科，使我國的婦女，對於家務同兒童敎養的知識，能更進一步的明瞭。關於這件計劃，她覺得單寡她一人的力量，是次辦不到的，所以她的學生能給她一臂之助。</p>
<p>我以爲這樣一個家政學校的創設，正是我國婦女們所急切待望的，尤其是在這個建國的時候，所以我希望除了王太太的學生以外，任何人都應給以最大的帮助，使它能早日或立。</p>

<h3>救救孩子！</h3>

<p>「救救孩子」！這是魯迅先生的「在人日記」的最未一句。這有力和眞誠的呼聲，認清孩子心中懷着溫情，坦白。說這話，距今已二十餘年了。戰前曾有「二十世耙是兒童的世紀」的口號。經過八年的抗戰，這口號漸漸地淡忘，代之而起的，爲「二十世紀是人已的世紀」。未來的人已就是孩子，但現在孩子的生活怎樣？且看街頭巷尾孩尸纍纍，飯店的開門者，童丐遍地皆是，戲院內賣糖果者，喊啞喉嚨的報販，工廠內的童工；有些熟練地抽着烟，打撲克，傳染着惡習；父母受氣歸家，常加以無理的責打。在富家，棄孩子於不顧，委之於無知之女傭，而自己則娛樂終日，或溺愛萬分，在校則刻板式的土課，規律式的敎育，與孩子天性之發展，大相逕　。</p>

<h3>新生活從家庭起</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>木期本刋出版，適値新生活運動周，同時各方國的努力目標，都在轉向家庭方面，例如最近本報，就刋有下列消息：</p>
<p>第一，本報記者邁天，特拜訪蔣夫人，蔣夫人就說起：「有許多人，往往忽視家庭主婦的地位和重要性。實際上，道是錯誤的。家庭主婦的責任是非常重要，尤其在抗戰期間，勉們不但要照顧丈夫孩子，料理家務，還時時帮助丈夫進行工作，她們對國家的貢獻，實在和丈夫是相等的。」</p>
<p>第二，錢市長在新運十二週年瞻望」一文裏，也說：「新生活運動，就是提倡「禮義廉恥」的規律生活。以「禮義廉恥」之素行，，習之於日常生活—「衣合住行四事之中。」</p>
<p>第三，敎育部爲加强推行家庭敎育，特規定全國各級民衆敎育館，一律以推行家庭敎育爲主要工作，其他各級社會敎育機關，均應各就所長，推行家庭敎育。</p>
<p>我國自從抗戰勝利以來，就須立刻走上建設的階段，就是齊家治國的工作的進行，要使團治，必先齊家，在目前這個時代，的確是再適合也沒有的，因爲我們社會的組織，是以家爲單位的，如果每一個家庭籠够實行新生活，每一個家庭能够致力於家庭敎育，那末，每一個家庭將是前進而充滿着朝氣的，我們的社會風氣，自然也不會有腐敗靡爛，所以爲了自身的幸福，爲了國族前途，勵行新生活，實在是每一個人應該的最低限度的責任。</p>
<p>風俗</p>
<h3>女權社會的苗人</h3>
<p>— 成一</p>
<p>我們普通總以爲苗人都住在西北各省的窮山僻野中，最近有朋友自後方來講起，才知道斯省景寗縣的深山中，也居有此族。</p>
<p>在我們想象中，苗人一定是粗野兇狠，慓悍，好鬥，嗜酒多疑，睚　必報的野人。然而事實却正相反，景寗縣的苗人性極柔　，喜歡和平，語言極輕，他們住在深山中，生人來至山中若高聲疾呼，他們竞避不敢見。到了他們的門口，必低聲下氣，這樣他們才敢延坐，　和你熟悉後，則時有餽贈，但皆爲粗劣之品，不堪食用。他們一年四季穿夏布，雖隆冬不改，連蓋的被也是數層夏布所製成。吃的是番薯之屬，山地瘠薄，無稻田可耕，但是他們力大異常，遠非我們所能及。傢具簡陋，極類吾族中之最窮困者。</p>
<p>苗人的制度爲女權社會，女權高於一切，凡是財政力田等　務皆由女人祖任；男子在家管理孩童，治理家政，担任烹飪等雜務，所以男子反極空閒。</p>
<p>有一女酋長，頭戴金銀珠寳，穿繡花的衣服，相傳係滿淸皇帝所封苗人咸須服從　的命令。</p>
<p>苗人婚姻極自由，每年有一天，踏月歌舞，男女咸集，都穿着紅綠的衣服，高歌舞蹈，自相擇配偶，由男子往女家住宿三日，仍歸已家，假使女人懷孕，則定婚姻。</p>
<p>苗人的敎育，現由省府設苗民學校，請漢人作敎師，敎育他們的子弟，粗野的生活似稍改變，開化當可指日而待。</p>

<h3>護士的組織</h3>
<p>— 薛藝</p>
<p>凡目的，問題及需要相同的各團體人員，皆應組織而擬具方針，章程與秩序。大家共享職　的利益，並以合宜的方法，達到其社會目的。團體運動對於護年很關重要，證明護士可以自負指導護士工作的責任，而不將責任委在其他團體身上，或聽其自然不加干涉。世界各國的護士都有組織。我國全國的組織，原名「中華護士學會」於一九一二年成立。護士職業雖然於一八八四士已有密女士傳來，但當時我國女子尚未解放，受敎育的都不出關門，所以不易進展。到一九〇八年，由各敎會醫院西國護士開始籌備，在最初三年沒有多大進步。至一九一二年議定護士學校註册辦法，標準課程，全國會老及發給護士會文憑，並提議於一九一四年在上海舉行全國護士會議。此會果眞實現，於是奠定我國議士的組織，並於一九二二年加入國際護士會爲會員，與其他各國護士平等，無形中提高了我護士的地位。現在改爲「中國護士學會」。該團體的工作如下：</p>
<p>（一）護生，就是護士學校的學生。當護士會成立的時候，就以統一全國各護士學校的課程及考試，並提高護士程度爲宗旨。工作包括：（甲）隨時修改舊有書籍，以期適合於現代潮流；（乙）舉行護士會考，合格者發給文憑，以昭公允；（丙）辦理轉學手續，使學生不致中途輟學；（丁）著作翻譯各種護病敎科書，以備學生之用；（戊）每兩年調查已登記的學校，隨時指示其應興應革之點；（己）辦理各校呈請登記事宜；（庚）開辦學校，由美國醫藥助華會捐助在貴陽，蘭州及重慶三處開辦護士學校，可多訓練護士人才，以應戰時及建設時的需要。</p>
<p>（二）護士，工作大綱就是增進護士利益，聯絡感情：（甲）將中國護士會文憑向國際護士會備案，使中國護士文憑，在國內國外都能有效通行；（乙）於一定時間召開全國護士學會，俾各地代表得有發表意見的機會；（丙）謀求我國護士在國際護士界的平等地位；（丁）發行護士季報或通訊，俾各地護士互通聲息，以發表各個人工作經騐及一切心得，彼此得益；（戊）策劃護士在國內的地位，並呈請政府承認；（己）開辦護士進修班，藉資深造；（庚）商取各國譴士留學獎金，使我國護士能至國外深造，俟政府還都，各種事業上軌道后，將舉行護士留學考試，該會會員均有資格參加；（辛）辦理護士登記事宜；（子）獎金由國外捐助，鼓勵及慰勞在邊疆服務的摔壞；（丑）救濟因戰爭而失業的護士並代謀職位。</p>
<p>（三）對國家與社會：（甲）造就人才以應社會的需要，使病者在機關內能得最優的護理而早日恢復健康，同時使健者能保持健康，就是使人人能步入健康的途徑；（乙）使整個社會能得到衛生與醫藥的常識，因爲護士是衛生敎員的先鋒；（丙）使國家增光榮，因爲我國護士在國際護士界已有地位。</p>
<p>該會有會所在南京，是由各護士捐助而造成的，建築堂皇，設備美麗。該會成立至今，會員不下萬餘人，四散全國。</p>

<h3>Chongqing Students' Patriotic Parade Demands Soviet Troops Withdraw from Northeast, Territorial Sovereignty Must Not Be Violated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] The patriotic parade of various schools in the Shapingba-Ciqikou area of Chongqing, with the participation of 22 schools and about 20,000 people, entered Shangqing Temple at 9:00 this morning. The orderliness of the ranks and the good discipline surpassed those of the past. The whole group shouted slogans with passionate fervor, marking a new era in the development of the student movement in the wartime capital. Spectators lined the streets, deeply moved by the colorful maps that symbolized the arbitrary carving up of Chinese territory. A special feature of this parade was the unanimous participation of faculty and staff from various schools, and the slogans shouted were also full of strong patriotism. As the procession passed, the public expressed deep sympathy and responded with warm applause. The procession demonstrated in front of the Soviet Embassy and Xinhua Daily, allowing one person to hold up a paper-made red conscience in front of Xinhua Daily, shaking it and shouting while the procession continued, intending to urge the Chinese Communist Party to wake up quickly, show conscience, and love the country. The procession dispersed at Xiaoshizi at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Students from major and minor schools in Chongqing, deeply concerned about the increasingly serious Northeast problem, eagerly hope that the Soviet Union will faithfully fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. To expand publicity, awaken the attention of compatriots across the country, and ensure the integrity of Northeast territorial sovereignty, a Chongqing Student Patriotic Movement Parade was organized. The patriotic parade was held on the 22nd. The participating schools (in order of the parade procession) include National Central University, Central University Affiliated High School, Central University Affiliated Elementary School, Sichuan Education Institute, Central Industrial College, Central Industrial College Branch, National Art College, Shuren High School, Shudu High School, Municipal High School, Chongqing Women's School, Chongqing University, Oriental Language School, Xiangya Medical College, Ordnance School, Dagong Vocational School, Zhonghua Vocational School, Private Xinzhong High School, Nankai High School, Nankai Institute of Economics, National Papermaking and Printing College, Zhongzheng School, Rotary School, National Pharmaceutical College, National Commercial Vocational School, National Social Education College, Jiaotong University, Chongqing University of Science, Central Political School, and Central Cadre School, etc. The Central University Professors' Association, Teaching Assistants' Association, Chongqing University Professors' Association, Teaching Assistants' Association, and professors, staff, and workers from various schools also enthusiastically participated. The parade procession included more than 20,000 people. The main group assembled and formed ranks at Xiaolongkan, Shapingba, at around 8:00 AM this morning and set off to enter the city at 5:00 AM, shouting slogans along the way and distributing five types of declarations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At the first light of dawn, the reporter waited by Hualongqiao, hoping to be among the first to witness this grand and enthusiastic parade by students from various schools in the wartime capital since the "December 9th" Movement parade after the victory of the War of Resistance. A team of four led the way carrying a large sign that read "Chongqing City Schools Student Patriotic Movement Parade." Students from various schools followed in order, holding up various large and small flags, banners, pictures, maps, and a portrait of martyr Zhang Xinfu. Students from the conference's disciplinary and hygiene groups rode bicycles and cars to patrol and take care of the procession. The broadcasting vehicle set up by the publicity group reported news along the way. Faculty and students from various schools were in high spirits, shouting slogans and singing songs such as "March of the Volunteers" and "Sacrifice Has Reached the Last Moment" in a tragic and passionate tone. Among them, phrases such as "Save Northeast Compatriots," "Defend Northeast with Iron and Blood," "Soviet Troops Must Withdraw from Northeast Immediately," and "Xinjiang is Xinjiang of the Republic of China," and "The Chinese Communist Party Should Love the Motherland" were the most thought-provoking. Spectators on the side of the road responded with warm applause and shouted slogans along with them. Some even set off firecrackers, indicating that this parade had aroused patriotic resonance among millions of citizens in the wartime capital. Elementary school students from the Central University Affiliated Elementary School, although still young, also participated vigorously, complementing the white-haired old professors from various schools, which was very touching. The main procession marched for about an hour, passing through Niujiaotuo, Shangqing Temple, Zhong San Road, Zhong Er Road, Zhong Yi Road, circling the Spirit Fortress, and turning to Linsen Road South District. The road order was orderly. They rested in the South District Park and had lunch. At around 3:00 PM, they passed through Lianglukou and Shangqing Temple and returned to school along the original route.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The slogans of the Chongqing Student Patriotic Movement Parade are as follows: (1) Soviet troops must withdraw from Cambodia immediately; (2) The Soviet Union should faithfully implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (3) Thoroughly investigate the Zhang Xinfu tragedy; (4) The Chinese Communist Party should thoroughly implement the Northeast agreement in the ceasefire agreement; (5) Xinjiang is the Xinjiang of the Republic of China; (6) Territorial land cannot be divided, sovereignty cannot be violated; (7) National interests are above all else; (8) Oppose the division of Inner Mongolia; (9) No excuse for the secession of the Northeast; (10) We cannot suffer a second (September 18th) humiliation; (11) The Soviet Union should respect the territorial sovereignty of China; (12) The whole country should unite against foreign aggression; (13) Save the compatriots in the Northeast; (14) The Northeast is our lifeline; (15) Support the government in adopting tough diplomacy; (16) The nation is above all else, and the nation is supreme; (17) No so-called special status for "Cambodia and Mongolia"; (18) Eliminate all illegal local regimes; (19) Eliminate all puppet organizations; (20) Absolutely support the government in taking over the Northeast; (21) Support President Chiang's leadership in peaceful national construction; (22) Defend the Northeast with iron and blood; (23) Descendants of the Yellow Emperor, show your conscience; (24) The Chinese Communist Party should love the motherland; (25) The so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" must not exist; (26) Abide by the United Nations Charter and maintain world peace; (27) The Northeast issue must be resolved before there can be world peace; (28) Oppose all new demands from the Soviet Union; (29) Down with neo-imperialism; (30) Long live the Republic of China, etc. Furthermore, when Chongqing students held a patriotic parade this morning, they distributed the following seven declarations: (1) A Letter to Compatriots Across the Country; (2) A Letter to People Around the World; (3) A Questioning of the CCP; (4) A Letter of Condolence to Compatriots in the Northeast; (5) A Letter to Compatriots in the Northeast; (6) A Letter of Protest to the Soviet Union; (7) A Letter of Protest to Chairman Stalin of the Soviet Union.

The Chongqing University Professors' Association and Teaching Assistants' Association issued: (1) A Telegram to the Soviet Government; (2) A Telegram to the Governments of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (3) A Letter to the Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Student Parade Releases "A Letter to the People of the World," Calling for Upholding Justice and Ceasing Aggression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] The Student Patriotic Movement Parade released a "Letter to the People of the World," stating: "We are young people, with patriotic fervor, pure conscience, and courageous spirit. We vow to fight to the end for the independence and integrity of the Republic of China." It continued: "The War of Resistance has been won, but a thick shadow has fallen on our hearts. In the days before Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union joined the Pacific War. Of course, we welcome our allies' active participation. Soon after Japan surrendered, Soviet troops immediately entered the Northeast, assuming responsibility for accepting surrender and taking over the Northeast. We are deeply grateful. The central state relations have become more cordial, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed. The annex to this treaty stipulates that Soviet troops would complete their withdrawal from the Northeast within three months after Japan signed the surrender. However, in fact, the Soviet troops' mission has long been completed, and the troops have been delayed for more than two months, not only showing no intention of withdrawing but also showing signs of long-term occupation. At the same time, they are doing everything possible to hinder our country's takeover work. China's troops originally intended to land in Dalian to take over the Northeast, but the Soviet side did not allow it. They then changed to Yingkou, and the Soviet side agreed, but then there was another change. Then, it was agreed to airlift troops to Changchun, but the Soviet side imposed various restrictions on the number and performance of the aircraft. On the one hand, they transported away all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, making it impossible for China to take over, and even transported away cattle, sheep, and food, making it impossible for the people to cultivate in the spring and making it difficult for the people to survive. Recently, the engineers sent by China to take over the Fushun coal mine were killed under the protection of the Soviet army. Whose fault is this? Whose responsibility is this? On the other hand, the Soviet side is also cultivating local armed forces in the Northeast, establishing a special regime, and brewing the so-called People's Republic of East Mongolia. From this fact, we can know their intention and intention. They are occupying land, hoping to continue to occupy it and not withdraw. They are creating a regime, attempting to divide China. People of the world, please open your eyes and see whether the Soviet Union's actions towards China are legal or the actions of an aggressor. We fought bitterly for eight years for the country, and the result is still a broken territory and unequal treatment. We have just defeated one enemy, and another stronger enemy has come to us, extending its claws. We love peace. People of the world who uphold justice, we sincerely appeal to you to give us assistance and jointly stop the aggressor. Our demands are: (1) The Soviet Union should faithfully implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (2) Firmly reject any new demands from the Soviet Union outside the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship; (3) The Soviet army's mission has been completed, and it should immediately withdraw from the Northeast; (4) The Soviet Union should return all materials transported from the Northeast."</p>
<h3>Appeal to Compatriots Across the Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The Chongqing Student Patriotic Movement Parade released "A Letter to Compatriots Across the Country," stating: "Today, our parade demonstration mainly aims to declare the dignity of our national sovereignty and safeguard the integrity of our national territory. To put it bluntly, we want to save our country and save our Cambodia North. The Northeast was originally our beautiful country, but today it has become a slaughterhouse at the mercy of others. The main reason is that the Soviet Union is unwilling to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance because, according to the treaty, the Soviet troops in the Northeast have a 'maximum of three months to complete the withdrawal period,' and according to the treaty, the Northeast should be taken over by our government. Today, six months and eight days have passed since the date of signing this treaty, and the Soviet army has not yet withdrawn. The Northeast is our lifeline. We can establish a strong and prosperous modern country, relying on the Northeast. We fought against Japan for eight years and suffered all the disasters in the world. Isn't it just because of the Northeast? Today, we have won the War of Resistance, and some people want to ruin our Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Can we just let it go? Absolutely not."</p>
<h3>President Chiang Congratulates Soviet Red Army Day by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The 23rd is the 28th anniversary of the Soviet Red Army Day. President Chiang has sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin to express his congratulations. The telegram reads: "To His Excellency Marshal Stalin, On the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the Red Army of your country, when our united countries have triumphed over aggressive violence and are working together to rebuild world peace, I would like to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency and the military and civilians of your country together with all the military and civilians of China."</p>
<h3>Freedom Imminent, To Be Realized Within the Month, Says Minister Wu of the Central Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Wu Guozhen, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, announced today: "Chinese newspapers will be unrestricted within a month, as free as American newspapers." Wu's statement indicated his complete agreement with the proposition on worldwide freedom of the press carried by Cooper, General Manager of the Associated Press. Wu mentioned a letter from Cooper to Stettinius, head of the U.S. delegation to the UN, stating that the right to know world events must be accompanied by the right to print and publish in order to achieve total press freedom. The letter was released on February 10.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Daily Smashed, Perpetrators Detained by Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 22nd] Today, when patriotic students held a parade to show their patriotism, a group of people put up slogans and chanted slogans outside the business department of the Xinhua Daily, which is run by the Communist Party. At that time, someone upstairs threw small objects such as teacups and phlegm containers at the crowd, which aroused public anger, and they rushed in and smashed the newspaper. Afterwards, several perpetrators were arrested, and the police authorities are currently investigating. In addition, the Democratic Newspaper, run by the Democratic League, was questioned by students today due to the publication of articles insulting the student movement some days ago, resulting in considerable losses. In recent days, the students in the wartime capital have been passionate about the Northeast issue, and there are obvious signs of spreading across the country. The general public is becoming increasingly impatient with the Communist Party's knowledge of only party and international affairs and not knowing about the country and nation, as well as the Xinhua Daily's failure to mention a word about the Soviet Union's withdrawal and its empty talk about democracy, while at the same time exaggerating the events at Jiaochangkou. Today, during the parade, the crowd shouted slogans such as "The CCP should show its conscience" and "The CCP should love the motherland," and demanded that the government adhere to a solemn position.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At around 1:00 PM on the 22nd, the business department of Xinhua Daily on Minsheng Road was smashed. The details are as follows: When the Shapingba students' parade passed by the business department of the newspaper at around 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, the students shouted slogans and posted slogans and maps on the glass windows and walls on both sides of the department. The road was extremely narrow and in the center of the city, the crowd was crowded, and the emotions were extremely excited. The student parade was orderly, and the conference disciplinary team maintained order at the entrance of the newspaper's business department. Twenty minutes after the student parade passed, the spectators were still standing nearby, watching the slogans without dispersing. Suddenly, someone tore up a few slogans, and the crowd was incited to anger and stepped forward to stop them. At that time, a public bus passed by, and the passengers in the bus shouted loudly, and the crowd rushed into the Xinhua Daily business department. The police stepped forward to stop them, and the crowd shouted, "Whoever protects the Xinhua Daily is a traitor," broke the door and windows, and carried out a massive destruction, throwing the books and newspapers in the house into the street. The crowd in the street applauded and shouted. Yang Liyuan, director of the Xinhua Daily business department, Xu Junman, director of the library class, and employees Guan Youmin and Pan Peixin, police chief Zhang Desheng, Xie Yunxiang, and policeman Tang Xiutai came forward to stop them and were beaten. Tang, the director of the police bureau, and Zhao, the director of the fourth branch, rushed to the scene with their teams after hearing the news, but the crowd gathered on the street, and the road was blocked. The police bravely rushed in and arrested the perpetrators. Police chiefs Zhao Bingxuan and Niu Jinyu, and policemen Yu Jun and five others were injured. Diao Zilong, Yin Wulin, Sun Shaoyi, Ding Youzhen, Shi Yaojiang, Hu Yingping, Pan Xingcheng, Yu Shuikuan, and Huang Yunbin were arrested on the spot. The crowd gathered and demanded their release. The security team forcibly escorted them to the fourth branch, and the crowd continued to clamor behind them. It was not until 3:00 PM that they gradually dispersed. According to Diao Zilong and others, they confessed that they were moved by the students' patriotic parade and participated in the destruction out of righteous indignation. Director Tang believed that the suspects were responsible for disrupting order and committing criminal offenses of damage and injury, and ordered them to be detained and sent to the court for investigation and prosecution. The injured were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment by the police bureau.</p>

<h3>French Colonial Minister Announces Contents of New Sino-French Agreement, Including French Renunciation of Extraterritorial Rights</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Well-informed sources claim: The terms of the new Sino-French agreement, in addition to France's announcement of the renunciation of all extraterritorial rights in China, will also open up part of the Haiphong port as a free port for China. The contents of the agreement announced by French Colonial Minister Moutet on Wednesday are as follows: (1) France announced the renunciation of all extraterritorial rights in China; (2) France agreed to open up part of the Haiphong port as a free port for China; (3) France will sell the section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within China to China; (4) France will allow full improvement of the status of Chinese people in Vietnam; (5) China will waive the demand for occupation fees for Chinese troops stationed in northern Vietnam.

<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Goes to Soviet Union for the Third Time; U.S. Statement on the Yalta Agreement and Sino-Soviet Treaty: Soviet Union Not Granted Priority</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, United Press, 22nd] Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Diplomatic Envoy for the Northeast, has gone to Moscow for the third time to discuss the issue of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Peiping, United Press, 22nd] The "Yishih Pao" newspaper here reports that Red Army troops in Harbin and other places are fully equipped and ready to move elsewhere. Very few officers and soldiers are allowed to leave their barracks. The newspaper believes that all signs indicate a major development is imminent. The newspaper continues: About 200 Soviet troops are currently undergoing training for a certain "new mission." It also states that a certain railway in the Northeast has been dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union, and an important electrical plant has been moved to Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>[Washington, United Press, 22nd] According to the U.S. State Department's announcement to United Press reporters yesterday: There are no clauses in the Yalta Agreement or the Sino-Soviet Treaty that allow the Soviet Union to obtain priority compensation or Japanese assets in the Northeast.

The day before the takeover, those Communist troops moved elsewhere again.</p>
<h3>The Devastation of Shenyang: The Former Industrial Area Leadership Turns to Rubble; Nine Foreign Reporters Now Free to Move Around</h3>
<p>[Changchun, this newspaper, 21st] In recent days, children in Shenyang have begun to welcome the nine foreign reporters appearing on the streets with cheers, just as people in Changchun cheered for the Allies in the Gao Market area on Sima Road. Liang and the other nine visited Mayor Dong Wenqi for the first time today and revisited Director Peng Bisheng. They will visit the Tiexi Industrial Zone on the 22nd and will be guests at Director Peng's banquet at noon.</p>
<p>[Shenyang, United Press, 22nd] Shenyang, the largest city in the Northeast, with a population of nearly two million, once one of the largest industrial centers in the East, is now devastated, resembling the aftermath of an earthquake. Garbage and filth fill the streets, and broken walls and tiles are everywhere. Dilapidated cars, broken machinery, shattered tombstones, and smokeless chimneys serve as monuments to the demise of industry. Commercial activity is extremely depressed, only about one-tenth of what it used to be. At key locations in the city, Chinese police occupy fortified positions behind sandbags and barbed wire. Gunshots and explosions occur intermittently, presenting a scene of unease everywhere. The streets and alleys are plastered with slogans in Chinese and Russian, congratulating the Sino-Soviet alliance and understanding. However, the Soviet troops have actually occupied the main square of the city, Central Square, while the Chinese mostly reside in the western part of the city. A huge portrait of Stalin is hung on the square's buildings. On the Chinese side, shops are mostly decorated with portraits of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Shenyang, United Press, 22nd] The number of Shenyang residents who have been robbed is very high. Soviet Commander Stankevich even had his watch stolen while bathing in a major hotel.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] After being confined to their residences for 54 hours due to the uncertainty of what the Soviet regime had determined as their fate, United Press reporter Davis and eight other British and American reporters were finally granted liberty today. They were now permitted by the Soviet authorities to explore this former location of Sino-Japanese aggression fourteen years prior, since the Shenyang Incident. For six months east, there have been many rumors coming from this warlord stronghold, such as rape, looting, kidnapping, and arson; its sinister situation not unlike the era of Genghis Khan. The reporter was planning on investigating and verifying this theory; to his shock, the Chinese and Soviet officials prevented him from doing so, until today. This was when a strapping, 46-year old, Soviet Major-General Stankevich announced: "Gentlemen, you are now free to move about Jiayuan, without any escort." The United Nations reporter's entrance in the northeast metropolis, occupied by the Soviet regime following the end of the war, represents the beginning. Our first impression is that two million inhabitants are suffering a sharp rise in the price of goods. Today, all foods have quadrupled in price, compared to six weeks prior. According to Soviet sources, 85% of the local factories were established for Japanese military needs. During the time, they are all closed. Between December of last year, and January of this year, typhus spread rapidly, infecting three thousand; the conditions were brought under control after many Red Army medical staff dispersed to offer protection. There are 30,000 prostitutes wandering the streets and frequenting the dance halls and tea houses. These are civic problems that Mayor Dong Wenqi and Police Chief Dai Hongdao have trouble dealing with. Therefore, they need to deliberate solutions with the Soviet Commander Stankevich often. Guarding the city are 6-7,000 of Stankevich's troops, belonging to Marshal Malinovsky's Second Ukrainian Long-Battle Soldiers. Between 10-20,000 National Army troops are stationed in the west industrial district, awaiting orders. These National Army troops are prohibited from moving about the city freely, without the express permission of the Northeast Security Forward Command. The Forward Command is only an arrow-shot away from the Red Army Command in the central circle. The circle has a memorial commemorating the Japanese victory during the Russo-Japanese War. Today, the surrounding buildings are covered with red flags, and the Red Army Command entrance has an enormous image of Stalin. There are no Japanese soldiers to be seen in the city, which is very different than the situation in North China. The original 60,000 Japanese troops stationed in Shenyang were all disarmed before the Soviet troops arrived by plane to attack on August 19th of last year. However, the Soviet authorities are unwilling to specify where these 60,000 Japanese troops are now. According to local rumors, none of them have been sent back to their home country. The strong and capable ones have all been sent to Siberia or the Soviet mainland to work in mines and build roads. As for where the Chinese Communist troops are, opinions vary, but it is generally agreed that traces of them can be found 30-50 kilometers outside the city. Chinese sources say that they are implementing a food blockade on the city. According to Stankevich, he met with the commander of the Eighth Route Army in December of last year, but because he failed to present credentials from the central government, he was asked to lead his troops out of the city. After staying for one or two days, 800 to 1,000 Communist troops left. All puppet troops were disarmed by the Soviet troops in July of last year.</p>

<h3>Truman Declares to Reporters: U.S. is Vigilantly Prepared to Ensure Military Secrets</h3>
<p>Washington is Quite Shocked by the Soviet Union's Statement</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman told reporters yesterday: "Measures to protect atomic energy and other secrets remain extremely complete. These measures were already very complete when I first learned of the leakage of classified information in Canada."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman declared at a press conference today: "The United States is sufficiently prepared to ensure the nation's military secrets. This has been the case in the past, and it will be in the future." At the same time, Secretary of State Byrnes reiterated his previous statement that the secrets of manufacturing the atomic bomb remain completely safeguarded by the United States. The Senate Atomic Energy Committee held a closed meeting today, listening to confidential reports from the chief of the espionage division of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, McKinnon, and the director of atomic bomb production, Major General Groves.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Washington feels unusually shocked by the Soviet government's statement the day before regarding the Canadian leak of classified information. The Soviet Union's admission that it obtained information about radar and atomic energy has raised concerns about the Canadian Army's current "Cow Exercise" in the northern region of the country, which will test the deployment of land and air forces. New radar inventions will be tested in this exercise.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 22nd] A Canadian Foreign Ministry official revealed that the Canadian government received a note from the Soviet Union on Thursday, criticizing the Canadian government's stance on the Soviet spy network case. The Cabinet will meet today to discuss this note.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 21st] The Associated Press learned today that certain information was "leaked" to Soviet agents when the Canadian government exchanged information with another unspecified country. A reliable government source said that the activities of Soviet spies in Canada reached an "alarming level" in September of last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 20th] (Delayed) The Soviet Union has not yet issued its final opinion on the espionage case announced by Canada. Future developments will depend on the Canadian government's response. The Canadian Ambassador to the Soviet Union went to London to attend the United Nations General Assembly and is reportedly on his way back to Moscow. The Canadian Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Melant, is maintaining close contact with the British and American embassies. (This dispatch from the United Press correspondent was sent to the Moscow censorship office at 7:10 PM on Wednesday and issued at 10:00 PM on Thursday. Neither New York nor London received the first section of the dispatch.)</p>
<h3>Before the Atomic Bomb Test: Residents of the Marshall Islands Evacuated; Cattle and Sheep Will Be Used Instead of Live People During the Test</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, 21st] The U.S. Navy is preparing to solve the mystery of future tactics: the atomic bomb's impact on naval power. Residents of the Marshall Islands are preparing to evacuate by naval ship next month to Kili Island, 135 miles to the east. Residents of Eniwetok and Bikini atolls will also be evacuated to avoid the radioactive particles in case they are affected by the downwind wave.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Vice Admiral Wyatt, commander of the Kwajalein base, is at the forefront of the atomic bomb test, presiding over the preliminary arrangements. When concerned friends asked if the atomic bomb explosion might cause a tsunami and the entire island would be swept away by the tide, Wyatt replied: "What's there to fear? We are in the center of the greatest experiment of our lives, enjoying the benefits of the experiment, truly attending a grand event."</p>
<p>[Washington dispatch] At the atomic bomb experiment near the Bikini Atoll in May, the joint Army and Navy commander of the Mobile Task Force, Vice Admiral Blandy, announced today: "Cattle and sheep will be tied to the target ships to replace live people." Scientists and military experts can learn from this the biological effects of heat, light, and radiation. Various physical measurements can be made on the animals, making it easy to accurately predict the reaction of the human body: death, serious injury, or minor injury. Mechanical methods were previously used to test the physical and biological effects, but it was felt that they were not comprehensive enough, so it was decided to use animals instead.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] While preparing to test the power of the atomic bomb on warships, the United States will also test the tolerance of warships and aircraft to the cold near the Arctic Circle. Foreign reporters are prohibited from attending the test.</p>
<h3>Using Atomic Bombs to Blast the Southern Ocean: Unearthing Treasures Under Thick Ice Layers</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] Rickenbacker, Chairman of Eastern Airlines, suggested to the Army and Navy authorities that atomic bombs be used to blast open the "South Polar Ice Box" in order to unearth minerals, coal, and oil that may be hidden under the thick ice layers there. He believes that this plan is within the realm of possibility and can at least determine "how much" valuable minerals such as gold, copper, and iron are buried in the South Polar region.</p>
<h3>Britain Suggested to the Soviet Union: Extending the Treaty of Friendship; Bevin States the International Situation in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] During a debate in the British House of Commons today, former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech, saying in part: "I believe that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to cooperate with Britain and the United States, and hopes that the United Nations organization will play a role. But while the Soviet Union wants the other two major powers to cooperate, it apparently wants other countries to comply with its terms, which is difficult to achieve and will sooner or later lead us into difficulties. If the Soviet government insists on going its own way, disregarding the will of its allies, then the allied nations will never comply."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who recently denounced the Soviet Union's accusations against Britain as lies in the United Nations Security Council, declared in the House of Commons today: "In December of last year, I informed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow that if he wanted to extend the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship to 50 years (originally 20 years), he could advise the British government to accept it. Rumors that Britain is gradually moving towards war with the Soviet Union are unfounded. What objectives would we be fighting for? Some people say that Britain and the United States are united against the Soviet Union. In fact, Britain and the United States can openly and honestly put all issues on the table and discuss them together. We ask the Soviet Union to do the same as the British government and the U.S. State Department do: discuss and exchange opinions. Britain is quite uneasy about the state of 'nerve warfare' between the Soviet Union and Turkey, but does not want Turkey to become a vassal state. The Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship expired last year, and we hope that it can be continued. If there are any modifications to the Montreux Convention regarding the Dardanelles Strait, Britain very much hopes that the international nature of the strait can be maintained."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Foreign Secretary Bevin, at the conclusion of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons yesterday, advocated that Germany's Ruhr region be placed under international joint management, and said that he had consulted very closely with France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and that those countries would soon consult with the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Left and Right Factions in the Iranian Parliament: Mutual Accusations of Theft Lead to Chaos</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] During a meeting of the Iranian Parliament yesterday, when Deputy Esfandiari claimed that he had received a telegram stating that the left-wing Tudeh Party (Labor Party) in the northern Iranian province of Mazandaran was forcing farmers, factory owners, and car owners to donate large sums of money, engaging in extortion to the extreme, and that the Tudeh Party clearly had other goals besides those it announced, left-wing deputies rose up to condemn the right-wing deputies, who were not to be outdone, and mutual accusations of theft were made. Even journalists joined in the mutual recriminations, and chaos ensued. Newspapers also reported that there were conflicts between the Democratic Party and patriots in Zanjan, northern Iran, resulting in 35 deaths on the Democratic Party's side.</p>
<h3>Demanding the Withdrawal of British Troops: Large-Scale Demonstrations by Egyptian Crowds; Machine Guns Roar, Cairo Becomes a Battlefield; Result: 17 Dead, 300 Wounded</h3>

<p>[United Press, Bombay, 21st] Indian naval striking sailors engaged in battle with British troops. Vice Admiral Godfrey today declared a state of "open mutiny" exists and stated that he would use all his power to quell the rebellion. The fighting broke out at the Kaser military camp, where Indian sailors had been on hunger strike earlier this week, demonstrating. Because they were prohibited from leaving the camp, the sailors attempted to break out, and British troops opened fire to stop them. The sailors retaliated, leading to a confrontational situation. Godfrey has sent an officer with a truce flag to the camp to deliver a warning letter, stating, "If you consider the superior forces now in the hands of the government, and that the government is willing to use them to the fullest extent, even if it means destroying your glorious navy."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons today that the Royal Indian Navy "rebels" have been told that only unconditional surrender will be accepted.

<h3>Plan Formulated Based on Directives; Japan to Purge Militaristic Elements; Hundreds More to be Dismissed; Japanese Liberal Party Launches Anti-Communist Movement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese sources announced today that the Japanese government will announce within a few days another interpretation of MacArthur's directive of January 4th, dismissing hundreds of military leaders and extreme nationalists from their positions and prohibiting them from engaging in political activities. The government has recently drafted a plan to purge civil servants and journalists who engaged in propaganda activities for the military during the war. This plan will soon be approved by the Privy Council. MacArthur's order stipulates that all political parties that were allied with totalitarian factions during the war must be deprived of their qualifications, and the Japanese government has previously issued an interpretation of this point. The new ban to be implemented will affect all members of the Military Council, as well as those who participated in meetings, including former Ministers of the Army and Navy, and officials above the level of bureau chief in the East Asia Board, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Information Bureau, as well as senior personnel in the Japan Broadcasting Corporation and the Domei News Agency.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Daily, Tokyo, 22nd] The president of the Japanese Liberal Party, Hatoyama, held a general affairs meeting yesterday to discuss strategies for establishing a stable force in the political arena. It was unanimously agreed that the Liberal Party's position absolutely cannot tolerate communism. The party had previously intended to appeal to all parties to uphold the national polity, and has now decided to further launch an anti-communist movement, raising the anti-communist slogan and appealing to all political parties to unite and form a stable force in the political arena with anti-communism as a common program.</p>
<h3>Japanese Major War Criminals Hire Defense Lawyers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that former Prime Minister Tojo and 27 other key figures, accused by the United Nations of initiating the Pacific War, are now hiring lawyers to defend them. The hired lawyers are all prominent figures in the country and are currently awaiting approval to meet with their clients. In addition to Hideki Tojo, figures such as Doihara, known as the "Lawrence of Manchuria," Minister of the Imperial Household Kido, and Commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army Matsui are also included. In addition to selecting Japanese lawyers, Tojo may also hire American lawyers for assistance, but whether Japanese and American lawyers will be allowed to jointly defend the case will not be known until the trial begins.</p>
<h3>First Time in Japanese History; Women Make Campaign Broadcasts</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Eight Japanese women today made the first campaign broadcasts in Japanese history, including a geisha, a hotel waitress, a medical school student, a housewife, and a farmer. It is said that if Japanese women had had the right to vote before the war, the war might not have occurred. When Japan holds its general election, women will use their right to vote for the first time. It is clear from this broadcast that Japanese women are very happy to have obtained the right to vote. One woman said that there must be debate in the family to develop political ideas, which made others laugh. Another woman said that politics seemed too bureaucratic in the past, only suitable for political and financial cliques, and not beneficial to women. We should eliminate this kind of politics, and the others echoed, "Yes, yes." According to the geisha, it has been decided to improve the level of geishas in her electoral district. Another woman replied that men's conduct may be stimulated and improved as a result.</p>

<p>China Farmers Bank manages huge agricultural loan</p>
<p>To revitalize sericulture and rescue the rural economy, the China Farmers Bank has launched a huge agricultural loan program. A total of 12 counties in Jiangsu Province, including Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Jiangyin, will receive loans totaling 100 million yuan. Wuxi and other counties are included in the ordinary agricultural loans, with a total loan amount of 800 million yuan. Yao Gongzhen, the director of the agricultural loan section of the bank's Zhenjiang branch, has visited Wuxi several times to investigate sericulture. It has been determined that the loan amount for this county will be 40 million yuan, and a agricultural loan meeting will be held at the county government at 9 AM on the 27th of this month, convening representatives from various seed-producing farms and silk factories to discuss loan methods.</p>
<p>The case of the major robbery in the county was solved quickly. The home of Qin Zhuxiang, a resident of No. 21 and a half Dacheng Lane in the city, was suddenly robbed at gunpoint by five bandits at around 9 PM on the 14th of this month. Gold, jade, jadeite, antiques, legal tender, clothing, and other items worth more than 30 million yuan were taken. This was a rare major robbery in the urban area. Fortunately, the county government and political police swiftly investigated and solved the case, capturing the three principal offenders, Xu Bingquan, Chen Hongchang, and Wu Zhiguang, one after another. They were escorted to the county government. After two interrogations by Shen Shizeng, a military law trial officer, Xu and Chen confessed to armed robbery and admitted to dividing and spending the loot. Wu denied everything. They were ordered to be shackled and imprisoned, awaiting review and transfer to the First Pacification Area Headquarters for military law punishment.</p>
<p>Bengbu</p>
<p>Large number of traitors escorted to Bengbu for interrogation</p>
<p>The work of suppressing traitors in northern Anhui has been actively launched in recent months. The county governments of Suxian and Jiashan captured traitors who helped the enemy and endangered the country. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Branch of the Anhui High Court here. They included Shan Yonggui, the puppet police chief of Suxian County; Ma Xihou, the section chief of the deed tax bureau; Mao Yuwen, the general affairs clerk of the puppet Damin Association; Huang Gengming, the president of the puppet labor union; Li Ruishu, the president of the puppet school;; Tan Songpu and Tan Bohan, the puppet district chiefs, who once recruited laborers for the enemy; and Wen Ziqin and Sun Chengfang; Liu Lingbo, the puppet county chief of Jiashan; Wu Yintang, the puppet county chief and commander of the security brigade; Chen Yaozhi, the puppet security brigade commander; Zheng Jiuting, the intelligence officer; Cheng Tiehan, the squadron leader; Xiong Baichuan, the attached officer of the puppet security squadron; and 15 others, all with solid evidence. The two county governments have transported the original files and handed them over to the First Branch of the High Court, where they are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>British MP Advocates Granting India Independence; British-Indian Negotiations to Take Place in New Delhi</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 22nd broadcast: British Liberal Party MP Maurice, who recently accompanied a British parliamentary delegation to India for inspection, argued in a local newspaper today that the situation in India is serious and all political parties should advocate granting India independence. At the same time, the political power in India should be transferred from the British to the Indians, and it must be realized quickly.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 22nd broadcast: The British special envoy delegation is scheduled to go to India in late March. It is said that the mission of this delegation is more important than the delegation from Britain attending the San Francisco Conference. Due to the large number of people, the British government will send the delegation to India using a large engineering aircraft. The negotiation location has been set as New Delhi.</p>
<h3>New Clarification of Wireless Radio; Controlling Aircraft and Ships; Accurately Surveying Terrain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The wireless radio navigation system that utilizes the reflection of radio waves to determine position, known as "LORAN," will soon be used to control aircraft and surface vessels, and its accuracy is unprecedented. This machine can also be used to survey terrain with exceptional accuracy, so better maps may soon be available. Details of this new invention were recently explained by Pierce of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Wireless Radio Laboratory at the first "joint" meeting held by wireless radio scientists in New York and London via international wireless telephone. Pierce predicts that the "LORAN" wireless radio can serve as an automatic pilot. Once installed in aircraft and surface vessels, it can "deliver" them to a predetermined location. At the same time, "LORAN" will plot the advance route of the aircraft and ships, so operators can always know the position of the aircraft and ships. Dr. Goldmark of Columbia Broadcasting Company reported another invention, which is the use of ultra-high frequency waves for color wireless radio transmission. It is said that using 490 kilocycles for transmission eliminates problems such as blurring. American wireless radio scientists participated in this meeting at the Astor Hotel in the center of Manhattan, listening to Dr. Dunsheath, the President of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers, predict the future development of electronics, after which both parties discussed via wireless communication across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan Searches for a Needle in the Taiyuan Ocean; Talks Freely with Our Reporter About the Military and Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Beigu Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>On the second day after the reporter arrived in Taiyuan (the 12th), I went straight to the Commander's Office to pay my respects to Commander Yan Baichuan, who had been in charge of Shanxi for 35 years, and was received. Commander Yan is 64 years old this year, and more than two-thirds of his beard and hair are white. However, he is still sharp-eared and clear-eyed, no less than in his younger days.</p>
<p>Grass Yellow General's Uniform Stained with Oil</p>
<p>Since Commander Yan returned to Taiyuan, he has continued to wear the same uniform in the most luxurious reception hall of the entire province as he did during the days in the anti-Japanese base in western Shanxi. The grass yellow general's uniform is stained with oil. The gold shoulder badges of the three-star general are worn and damaged from long use. He wears Chinese-style long cloth cotton shoes.</p>
<p>On this day, Commander Yan ordered the reporter to sit close to him, and with a warm and enthusiastic demeanor, he immediately spoke freely about his ideological development and the current problems for as long as two hours. At 6 PM on the evening of the 13th, Commander Yan again hosted a banquet at the North Official Hall of the Commander's Office, inviting more than a dozen colleagues from the news media to attend. During the banquet, Commander Yan expressed his views on freedom of the press. For the sake of prudence, in addition to providing detailed verbal answers to the twelve questions raised by the reporter, Commander Yan also provided written answers. The important points of the written questions and answers are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Executive Headquarters Order No. 2; Disputes Unresolved</p>
<p>(1) What are the current areas of Shanxi controlled by the National Army? What are the areas controlled by the Communist Army? Where are the conflict points?</p>
<p>Yan replied: There are a total of 106 counties in this province, and the National Army controls 67 counties. Among them, the four county seats of Yijing, Fushan, Boyuan, and Zuoquan were occupied by the Communist Army after 12 PM on the 13th of January. The current conflict areas are in Qin County, Wenshui, Wenxi, Zhongyang, and other county towns. The current disputes are no less than those involved in implementing Executive Headquarters Order No. 2. The Taiyuan Executive Team recently inquired about our opinions, and we replied that we would implement it strictly without violating or discounting it. If the order can be implemented, there will be no disputes. Currently, along the Eastern Qin line, the Communist Army is destroying and attacking every day. According to reports, the Communist Army is mobilizing strategic troops from various places, concentrating their forces to attack and destroy. Among them are also Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Jin Intends to Formulate Implementation Plan; Integrate Soldiers and Farmers</p>
<p>(2) After the victory and return to Shanxi, what modifications have been made to the various policies of the Jinxi era?</p>
<p>Commander Yan replied: In commerce, the controlled methods have been abolished, and people are free to trade. In prices, the evaluation method has been abolished, and prices are freely negotiated by both parties. The four-hour daily living labor of cadres, soldiers, and soldiers of various troops and agencies has been abolished. Each county government has established a cooperative guidance office to guide the people in each village to prepare for the establishment of production and sales cooperatives.</p>
<p>(3) What are the plans for the administration and construction of Shanxi in the future? Commander Yan replied: After returning to the province, we are troubled by life, with no food and no funds, and the cadres and soldiers all feel the pain of life. The people are in a state of difficulty and turmoil rarely seen in history due to the disorder of order and the severance of transportation. Therefore, the key to governance lies in restoring order, reorganizing troops, adjusting food, and stabilizing people's lives. In the future, we will plan to build water conservancy ourselves. We have agreed with the Water Conservancy Committee to integrate soldiers and farmers. Five thousand national defense workers will build water conservancy projects. Another five thousand people will build walled railway tracks. Another 100,000 people will handle important national defense industries and other construction matters.</p>
<p>(4) The Political Consultative Conference has a new view on the status of the provinces. Does the commissioned official have any opinions on this? Should the provinces and districts be reduced? How should the Shanxi provinces and districts be reorganized?</p>
<p>The answer of the national fearful official is as follows: The Consultative Conference adopts a system of equal power between the central government and local governments, which is the implementation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. As for the latter two questions, I am still considering them and cannot answer them. I am very sorry!</p>
<p>(5) There are detailed answers regarding the management of enemy expatriates and enemy prisoners, and earnestly addressing the Han traitors in the province, and they are actively underway. In addition, Commander Yan also raised issues such as strengthening the work of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, hoping that the future revival can be promoted in some way.

<h3>When Will the Golden Age of the Industrial World Return? Depression Envelops Kunming</h3>
<p>…Compiled by Our Newspaper Translation Office…</p>
<p>The golden age of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province during the war, has passed. Kunming was once longed for and dreamed of by gold diggers, smugglers, and speculators as the Golden City of China, but after Japan surrendered, like a wartime nouveau riche, it plunged into the shackles of depression.</p>
<p>Adventurers and gold diggers are all musing with great emotion: "Where are the beautiful scenery of yesteryear?" People at that time, by doing speculation, buying and selling US dollar tickets, sleeping soundly, could become rich overnight, which was often possible.</p>
<p>These "good old days" did not seem so "good" to the average person. After more than eight years, the war finally ended, and they had been waiting impatiently. However, what completely disappointed them was that their "nightmare" did not disappear with the end of the war. The arrival of peace did not bring them an easy life and the bright opportunity to pursue happiness and happiness in the peaceful era they had been looking forward to. On the contrary, the difficulties of life, even if they did not increase, were at least the same as during the war. We have a saying: "Jump out of the frying pan and jump into the fire." This situation is very similar.</p>
<h3>Commercial Factories Suffer the Most Profoundly</h3>
<p>After the Japanese devils surrendered, a sharp economic depression occurred in Kunming. The local industrial world was greatly affected. After Japan's surrender, the plummeting prices of daily necessities and the shrinking market demand were equivalent to stabbing several knives into the chest of Kunming's industry. Many factories could not withstand these storms and closed their doors. According to statistics published by the Yunnan Branch of the China Enterprise Association in November 1945, only 40 of the 77 factories in Kunming were still operating, and the rest were either bankrupt or suspended. These figures, when analyzed, are very interesting, because the owners, types, and nature of the various factories are all different. Among these 77 factories, 13 are owned by the central government and 15 are privately owned. The hardest hit were the privately run factories. The table below can be used for comparison:</p>
<p>Factory Nature | Total Number of Factories | Number of Bankruptcies | Percentage</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>State-owned | 13 | 5 | 39%</p>
<p>Provincially owned | 19 | 6 | 32%</p>
<p>Commercial | 45 | 26 | 58%</p>
<p>The table above reveals the situation completely and does not require any explanation. These are still the comparison figures for November 1945. Two months have passed, and things have become worse and worse. According to Dr. Xu, president of the Yunnan Branch of the China Enterprise Association, it is estimated that 90% of the factories in Kunming have gone bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Most of the State-Owned Factories Have Been Closed</h3>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the situation of state-owned factories. During the War of Resistance, the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs established many factories in Kunming. Among them, the most important are: Central Electrical Equipment Factory, Central Machinery Factory, Kunming Electric Smelting Plant, Central Wireless Electrical Equipment Factory Kunming Branch, Kunming Chemical Materials Factory, Kunhu Factory and several other factories. These are not only the best factories in Kunming in terms of equipment and employees, but they can also be counted among the best in the country. Except for Kunhu Factory, some of the above-mentioned factories have moved away from Kunming, while others have temporarily suspended work, waiting to be evacuated or liquidated. The Central Electrical Equipment Factory has moved to Nanjing and established a branch factory in Hankou. The Central Wireless Equipment Factory is on its way to Beiping. The Kunming Electric Smelting Plant and the Central Machinery Factory merged into one factory. The Kunming Chemical Materials Factory is at a standstill. The operating capacity of Kunhu Factory is only 10% of what it used to be. The normal output in the past was 4,000 kilowatts per day, but now it can only produce 400 kilowatts.</p>
<p>Although the situation of Yunnan Provincial factories is better, they have also been forced to reduce production, and the salary cuts and layoffs have also been reduced. High-paid employees and skilled workers are not cutting costs. Yudian Yarn Factory has now stopped night work and laid off many workers. Employees and workers have been laid off, and the factory has hired low-paid employees and female workers to replace them.</p>
<h3>The Dumping of Goods from the Warehouse Makes All Factories Feel Embarrassed</h3>
<p>The embarrassing situation in which the factories in Kunming are currently in is mostly due to the fact that most of them were established during the war to adapt to the needs of the war. They are almost completely dependent on the agreed orders from the military, so this is a very natural trend. At this time, as the Sino-American forces withdrew and adjusted, these factories that emerged during the war naturally declined. The US military supply office announced its closure, and the result made 98% of Kunming's alcohol factories and machine factories also close down.</p>
<p>Many families bought a large amount of raw materials at high prices before the end of the war, so when prices plummeted, their production costs were still very high. This is one of the factors of loss. The big hoarders in Kunming were greatly panicked because the war ended suddenly, so within a few days of the Japanese surrender, they dumped a large amount of goods on the Kunming market, which further accelerated the sharp drop in market prices. (Translated from the February issue of the Miller Review)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Supervision and Political Reform (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Xu Erxin</p>
<p>Our country's salt management area has always had clear regulations, that is, the abundance of production in a certain area is limited to the transportation and sale to a certain shore, and a certain shore also sells the spirit of certain salt-producing areas, dividing the borders and boundaries between each other, and not mixing with each other. The Song Dynasty also established the law of entering orchids, and the Yuan Dynasty issued articles on violating the borders, prohibiting them very strictly, and following them from the Ming Dynasty to the present, following them without changing. Since the Republic of China, there has been a slight flexibility due to local conditions. This system of dividing the land and managing the spirit, with each having a fixed amount, is because salt is a necessity for people's food, and salt production is in a fixed place, unlike the five grains that can be planted anywhere. At that time, traffic was inconvenient, for</p>
<h3>Considering the People's Food</h3>
<p>Planning must be made for a well-planned distribution to avoid excessive crowding and shortages, with the profound intention of balancing production and sales and regulating supply and demand. However, the distance varies from place to place (e.g., Zhenbujiuzhe, a village in Zhejiang, is hundreds of miles away from the salt fields, while Huai'an is separated by a river. Jingjiang is close to the Huai'an salt fields, but consumes Zhejiang salt because Zhenjiang is the throat of Zhejiang salt and Jingjiang is the gateway to Suzhou and Changzhou, used to block the encroachment of Huai'an smuggled salt). The difficulty of transportation varies (e.g., Tongshan and Suqian exclusively sell Eastern salt, drawing south from Yongfu and other salt fields, ranging from seven to eight hundred miles to a thousand miles, but it is close to Haizhou and Ganyu in northern Jiangsu. Previously, transporting from Tongshan and Suqian to Haizhou and Ganyu was very difficult by land and water. After the Longhai Railway opened, it would be more convenient to switch to selling Huaifeng salt). Given the current competitive situation, it is necessary to redraw these sales areas. In addition, tax rates and salt prices vary from place to place (for example, Huai salt sold in Liyang, western Hubei, requires additional insurance due to passing through heavy tax areas. In the upper four townships of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the tax rate is specially levied, while the surrounding areas have very heavy taxes). Therefore, the sales volume of salt varies in different places. However, according to the law, selling salt from areas with sluggish sales to areas with high demand, or using salt from areas with low taxes to flood areas with high taxes, is considered smuggled salt. This unreasonable regulation needs fundamental reform. Although the system of designated merchants in designated areas has been abolished and a uniform tax system has been adopted, the sales areas should be rationally and appropriately divided according to the actual production and sales situation, based on the principle of the shortest distance, most convenient transportation, and lowest cost. This would ensure that the production of a certain salt field is allocated to a certain sales area, forming a rational and natural trend, fundamentally eliminating problems such as "cross-selling," "flooding," and "blending" sales. However, people can still freely purchase salt from various places without any restrictions. The salt industry company should stipulate appropriate transportation routes based on the divided sales areas. These transportation routes must be coordinated and closely linked with the inspection lines of the anti-smuggling agencies, so that smuggling can still be investigated along the lines after it occurs.</p>
<h3>Reader's Opinions: A Plea from Public School Teachers</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Has the government already decided to encourage idleness? This question seems to be very affirmative. Because every time the salary class complains, they get a pay raise. Of course, we cannot but say that the government and dignitaries are appreciating the officials. But for those public school teachers with the lowest salaries, because they endure hardships and are unwilling to trouble the government, they endure, endure, and wait for fair treatment from the government. As a result, the government turns a blind eye, leaving them to suffer from hunger and cold. It seems to be hinting to them: "Those of you who have not been idle do not need a raise. If you want a raise, no one will care about you unless you complain." Is that so? Is this a clever way? Because of this, everyone suddenly realizes that it is impossible without the weapon of idleness. Isn't this encouraging idleness?</p>
<p>Sir, we do not want to trouble the government, do not want to use weapons to intimidate the most respected government, and do not want to abandon our duties. But we are also human beings and need food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. What do you think we should do?</p>
<p>I boldly request that the government treat us who do not complain the same as those who do complain, and even hope for more favorable treatment. This way, those who complain will realize that idleness is not the smartest behavior. Perhaps it can slightly reduce the trouble of those gentlemen running around to mediate! A public school teacher.

<h3>Editorial: Don't Believe It? Let's Try Again!</h3>
<p>"Justice is born from fairness" is an old saying that still holds true. "Onlookers see more of the game," but only truly objective onlookers who are not involved in their own interests can be selfless and achieve "clarity." Only true objectivity can lead to fairness and clear understanding. Once personal interests are involved, even clear and visible things can become blurred, leading to misjudgment. Even when others point it out, people still don't believe it. Why? Because "selfishness" blinds them! If they don't believe it, let them try again. What is painful is that China has been poor and weak for a hundred years, and suffered eight years of war. Today, like someone recovering from a serious illness, we cannot afford to experiment with dangerous remedies and suffer another disaster!</p>
<p>We have long said that post-war China will face two major obstacles: one is disguised aggression from abroad, and the other is an internal economic crisis. These two major obstacles are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. What is particularly worrying is that there is still a group of people in the country who secretly welcome the early arrival of these two major obstacles, believing that they will have an opportunity to show their skills when these obstacles arrive. Therefore, to resolve this crisis and break these two major obstacles, the only way is for the government to take responsibility, stand tall, make all political and economic facts public, embark on the path of true democracy, mobilize the great power of the people, and implement fair and wise effective policies. This will prevent those who hope for adversity from having any opportunity to use their skills. Only in this way will those who deliberately obstruct domestic peace not dare to obstruct it, those who deliberately undermine international peace not dare to undermine it, and those who are speculating and manipulating prices not dare to speculate and manipulate, harming the national economy. However, in recent months, we have only seen flattery from a few people, struggles between certain parties, territorial disputes and disturbances by certain armies, repeated delays in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, procrastination and slowness in the handling of the takeover, and soaring prices and frequent labor strikes under the influence of speculative capital. The voices of the true people are still very weak, let alone their actions. It has been more than half a year since the Japanese surrendered, and the people were overjoyed! The golden age, the good opportunity, has been missed! But today, does the authorities have any regrets? Do the Communists have any desire to redeem themselves? Do social leaders and ordinary citizens have the mentality to learn from the pain and start anew? After seeing the situation in the half-month after the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, we are truly terrified.</p>
<p>Originally, China's victory and China's reputation as one of the "Big Four" were achieved by the great leader leading the soldiers in bloody and hard battles. Eight years of struggle was not easy. It is a pity that the general public, especially the bureaucrats and politicians, were blinded by victory. They thought that the opportunity to quickly seize power and resources had arrived, but they did not care about the country's major domestic and foreign policies. The people originally had unlimited expectations for the Political Consultative Conference, believing that all the gentlemen, whether in power or in opposition, would plan for the country and the nation. In particular, the Communist Party, which claims to represent the people, should put down the butcher knife. Even bandits can "wash their hands," let alone political struggles? Who knew that the result, in addition to the empty affirmation of the Three Principles of the People as the founding principle and support for President Chiang as the national leader, did not substantively solve any major domestic and foreign problems for the country and the nation. The Communist Party's occupation of territory remains the same, the obstruction of the takeover in the Northeast remains the same, the soaring prices remain the same, the people's livelihood remains unstable, and the incompetence of officials and the selfishness of parties are not only seen through by the people but also recognized by friendly countries. To the extent that it is self-inflicted, how can it not lead to more serious foreign aggression and a more urgent economic crisis?</p>
<p>Currently, everyone is shouting about the shadow over the Northeast, and everyone is roaring for heads to stabilize prices. It is a pity that when we pointed out that there were already dark clouds in the Northeast, some people still wanted to cover it up, insisting that the Northeast was a bright paradise and not allowing the people to say a word! It is a pity that when we want to investigate who is responsible for the speculative price increases, some people still want to use stopgap measures to muddle through, thinking that they can stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood! It is clear that this road is impassable, but they don't believe it and think it makes perfect sense. They deceive, deceive, shout, and make noise, thinking that if they do this, the Communist army can be reorganized after the successful consultation, the Northeast can be recovered after the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty, and prices can be stabilized after the auction of enemy property. But what is the result?</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Northeast issue. It is clear that the ceasefire order between the government and the Chinese Communist Party stipulates that the entry of the National Army into the nine provinces of the Northeast or the mobilization within the nine provinces of the Northeast does not affect it. So why does the so-called Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party demand the recognition of 300,000 troops of the Democratic Allied Army in the Northeast, while restricting the number of National Army troops entering the Northeast? It is clear that the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should fully provide moral and material assistance to the National Government. So why assist the so-called "Eighth Route Army" and "New Fourth Army" in establishing a democratic government? And why is there a "Eastern Mongolia Autonomous Republic"? And why did they allow Zhang Xinfu and others to be brutally murdered? And why did the Soviet troops delay their withdrawal again after the deadline? All of this shows that the Northeast issue is both an internal conflict and a foreign invasion; the Northeast issue is both a conspiracy of the Communist Party and a trick of the Soviet Union! The Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed by the plenipotentiaries of both parties, but China was in fact betrayed by the Yalta Secret Agreement! The Chinese people today will never repeat the Boxer Rebellion's xenophobia, but the Chinese people today will never be willing to be slaughtered by the great powers like in the late Qing Dynasty! And frankly speaking, the Communist Party today borrows foreign power to strengthen itself, hoping to occupy Liaodong to dominate. No matter what its purpose is, its intentions are almost the same as those of the puppet Manchurian Puyi. And Puyi was still an ignorant puppet, while the Communist Party steals the name of democracy and secretly acts like a tiger for the demon. We common people really don't understand why the government is tolerating the demon to this extent. Is there anyone who is a demon for the demon other than the demon? The Northeast is China's Northeast, and the administrative sovereignty of the Northeast should absolutely and entirely belong to China! The Northeast is an internationally valued Northeast, and the economic resources of the Northeast should be jointly developed internationally by China according to the teachings of the National Father, and should never be allowed to be monopolized by one country! We don't need to ask about the Yalta Secret Agreement, and we don't want to keep the Sino-Soviet Treaty alone (it only has value if both parties abide by it, otherwise it is equivalent to waste paper). To solve the Northeast issue, we only need to adhere to the twelve words "military and political unity, complete sovereignty, international development" as a guideline, so that there will be no major mistakes. If there are still people who don't believe it and just want to deceive the people, appease the demon, and please the powerful neighbors, then let them try the result of their methods again. They will inevitably completely lose the Northeast and cause a third world war!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the price issue. We have already offered our opinions. The methods to stabilize prices mainly include strictly prohibiting speculation, promoting production, reducing currency circulation, and distributing it evenly. These fair and easy-to-implement measures should be universally implemented without hesitation. However, what is the situation today? In terms of prohibiting speculation, it is prohibited in name but not in practice, prohibited in this place but not in another, verbally fined but not actually punished, checks are investigated for withdrawals but cash withdrawals are not, so the end result of this piecemeal approach is that prices will soar everywhere and become a tracking state, and the prices of various goods will rise and become a race. In terms of encouraging production, factories are auctioned off only for high prices, and when they can start operating is not asked; labor disputes are mediated only by raising wages, and whether the capital can afford it and the labor's skills are not asked; profitable things are handled by the government, easy things are run by the state, fuel must be controlled, applications are difficult to buy, and the private capital has no way out, so they look for other ways, which are not asked; land tax, raw material tax, finished product tax, capital tax, business tax, profit tax, transfer tax, lease tax, are levied repeatedly, with numerous procedures, and the cost is high, the restrictions are strict, which are not asked. With this approach, who would want to invest in production? In terms of reducing currency circulation, administrative institutions are piled up, government offices are full of redundant staff, public school teachers are complaining endlessly, and the national treasury's expenses almost entirely rely on printing money, which is not enough, and letting the public bonds rise and fall without considering issuing new public bonds; letting the gold jump wildly without considering the unlimited sale of gold or nationalizing it; ostensibly strictly investigating the exchange of checks to show the tightening of credit, but absolutely letting go of cash exchanged by banks, so people compete to withdraw cash to buy gold and materials instead of depositing it in banks. … All of these run counter to the purpose of reducing currency circulation. In terms of equal distribution, the organization of consumer cooperatives has not been valued by society. Not only has it not been valued, even suggestions are rarely heard; procurement is competed for by each; goods are competed for by each; rice and cloth are released only after the price is high, and the fair price is discounted according to the market, and the queue is squeezed, and it is announced to be sold out in a blink of an eye, but in reality it falls into the hands of speculators. Even if society has goods, it may not be able to provide the means for common people to support their families, but instead becomes a tool for transformed merchants to hoard and profit. In this way, how can prices not rise madly step by step! Therefore, from today's way, without changing today's customs, even if the authorities sing high-pitched songs about suppressing and stabilizing prices every day, prices will inevitably rise as before. Isn't this pouring soup to stop boiling and adding fuel to the fire? To tell another joke, isn't the market joking with the authorities, but the authorities are intentionally or unintentionally joking with the common people!</p>
<p>People suffer from not knowing themselves! The current officials are too confident! Some of them don't believe in the power of fair public opinion, don't believe in the support of international justice, don't believe in the mad shouts and screams of the people, don't believe in the straight words of the students, they only think that their own methods are all correct! They don't know themselves, let's try again!</p>

<p>In addition, the Shanghai Student Union has started responding to the patriotic movement of Chiao Tung University yesterday. At 8 p.m. last night, representatives from various schools held a preparatory meeting for the memorial service for Zhang Xinfu at Yucai Middle School. Patriotic slogans posted by students could be seen everywhere in the Nanjing Road area. Shanghai Lin University also held a meeting in the first and second branch classes and the general class at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss the opinions on maintaining the integrity of territorial sovereignty.

(B) Hold a parade and rally at the Bund Park today. (3) Issue a declaration.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman</p>
<p>The telegram from the Patriotic Student Movement Assembly of Chiao Tung University to Chairman Chiang, urging him to adopt a firm attitude, reads: To Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing National Government: Since the violent Japanese bandits occupied the Northeast and the compatriots outside the pass were displaced, they have long been subjected to humiliation and abuse. They looked forward to the arrival of the righteous army more than to clouds and rain. Under your wise and virtuous leadership, we have endured hardships, lived together, and taught, so we feel the pain of the fathers and elders outside the pass more than if it were our own. This feeling and intention have never been released. Since the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, thanks to your wise leadership and the soldiers' bloodshed, justice has warned the public, and victory has been achieved, which can save our fathers and elders from deep water and fire. However, all the reports from Lingnan say that the Northeast is getting darker and darker every day. Is it not enough to recover the Northeast after fourteen years of weeping and eight years of bloodshed? Has the war in the five continents not won complete peace? We have witnessed the territorial sovereignty of the country repeatedly being humiliated. The Soviet troops have been slow to withdraw, Zhang Xinfu has been brutally murdered, and innocent people in Shenyang have been shot. The changing situation is appalling. Looking at Shanhaiguan, we are filled with indignation. We dare to take the liberty to vow to be the government's backbone and work for complete peace. We beseech you to adopt a firm attitude to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty, so that the great cause of national construction can be developed and our China can forever become a prosperous, strong, and free country. The Patriotic Student Movement Assembly of National Chiao Tung University bows respectfully.</p>
<p>The conference also sent telegrams to all schools and organizations across the country, urging them to be the backbone of the country and jointly participate in this righteous cause. At the same time, it sent telegrams to the student unions of National Central University and Chongqing University, asking them to forward them to the schools and organizations participating in the patriotic movement, saying that they had learned that their schools were launching a movement of three strikes and one parade for the sake of loving the motherland, which was a magnificent, enthusiastic, and indignant demonstration of patriotism worthy of commendation. They must strive to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty and forever protect our free and equal status. Although we are thousands of miles apart, our hearts are completely united. We hope to maintain contact and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Declaration to Compatriots</p>
<p>The Patriotic Student Movement Representatives Conference of National Chiao Tung University issued a declaration yesterday, respectfully informing compatriots: (1) Support the government in adopting strong diplomacy to maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. (2) Resolutely reject any Soviet demands on our country other than those stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. (3) In order to achieve complete peace, we vow to be the government's backbone to the death. (4) The Northeast shall not be given special status. (5) East Mongolia shall not be given special status. (6) Investigate the conspiracy behind the murder of Zhang Xinfu. (7) Absolutely do not recognize the Yalta Agreement. (8) The economic negotiations with the Soviet Union should be made public to the world. (9) Fourteen years of tears and eight years of blood cannot be shed in vain. (10) Do not want to see a second "September 18th Incident."</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief He's Residence Burglarized; Case Solved Swiftly in Eight Hours</h3>
<p>All Stolen Goods Recovered and Two Criminals Apprehended</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The private residence of Army Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin at 1634 Linsen Middle Road was burgled the night before last (the 20th) after midnight. Thieves broke into the living room and stole a porcelain chicken dish, twelve porcelain meat basins, nine porcelain teacups, and over a hundred antique items. They carried the stolen goods out and by dawn, at 5:30 AM, hired a rickshaw to transport them to 2, Caishen Lane, Danfeng Road in the South City, where they hid them at Yu Mingde's home. That morning, the servants at the He residence discovered the major theft and immediately reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which forwarded it to the Changshu Precinct in charge, ordering them to solve the case within 24 hours. Precinct Chief Fu Sugang immediately instructed Zhang Canguang, the Chief of the Judicial Section, to dispatch officers within the precinct to notify all pawnshops and consignment stores to report to the precinct for investigation if the aforementioned stolen goods were brought in for pawn or sale. By 11:30 AM, two people indeed arrived at 472 Linsen Road, Wan Jin Ji Consignment Shop, carrying a large number of stolen goods by rickshaw for sale. However, the shop had already been notified by the precinct. Upon careful examination of the stolen goods, they matched the reported stolen items. The shop assistants pretended to be agreeable and bought all the stolen goods for 120,000 legal tender. As they were leaving, one of the assistants followed them to the aforementioned residence of Yu Mingde at 2 Caishen Lane, South City, and secretly reported the situation to the Changshu Precinct. In the afternoon, Precinct Chief, Deputy Chief Huang Zhen, and the Director of the Judicial Section led officers Li Jiapu, Liu Shizhu, Li Pengfei, Wang Chenglong, etc., to wait and watch. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, they apprehended both criminals on the spot. Under interrogation, one was named Zhu Yao, 23 years old, from Pudong, a high school student. The other, the receiver of stolen goods, Yu Mingde, confessed to the theft without hesitation. They were then taken to Wan Jin Ji, where all the stolen goods were recovered.</p>

<h3>Authorities Determine Emergency Measures for Soaring Rice Prices</h3>
<p>With the black market price of gold repeatedly soaring, rice profiteers are taking advantage of the situation. Over the past two days, the price of rice has increased by more than 10,000. The Grain Administration Commissioner Yang Xizhi flew to Nanjing the day before yesterday to request instructions on emergency measures from the Changju Bureau. It is reported that Mr. Yang returned to Shanghai last night and has determined methods to suppress grain prices. Yesterday, the price of rice continued to rise with the black market price of gold. Before 9:00 AM, the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office first released 5,000 *shi* of *wuxian* rice at a price of 18,000 (the day before yesterday it was 10,000 *shi*). At that time, the price of *bai geng* rice from various firms immediately stood at 28,000. After fluctuating for a while, news suddenly came that the black market price of gold had jumped dramatically, and the price of rice soared to 31,000. The supply exceeding demand was truly shocking.</p>
<h3>Found Hand Grenade; Explosion Injures Four</h3>

<h3>How to Resist Wild Speculation and Buying</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Canglong</p>
<p>Gold knocks at the 2 million mark, U.S. dollars at 2,650 yuan, *bai geng* rice shouts over 32,000 yuan… everything else is rising irrationally and wildly! Every day a fiery page is acted out! Every day new highs are created!</p>
<p>Economists rack their brains to analyze, concluding that this is due to political instability, subtle international relations, unannounced exchange rates, inflation, transportation difficulties, lack of material supply, unrecovered production, speculative manipulation, hoarding… this series of well-worn arguments still cannot decipher the riddle of the constantly rising speculative market!</p>
<p>Chen</p>
<p>Xing, the Financial and Monetary Commissioner for the Nanjing-Shanghai District, said: We are an agency executing orders. We report the financial and monetary dynamics here to the central Changju Bureau and the Municipal Government in Chongqing every day, awaiting approval of handling methods. On the one hand, we do our best to take necessary measures within our jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Speaking of</p>
<p>the recent suspension of gold sales by the Bank of China in Chongqing, Commissioner Chen said that this move was not a cessation of gold sales, but because the purchasers were too crowded during the issuance, and the order was somewhat chaotic, so the sales were temporarily suspended. After finding ways to improve it, the sales would be continued. This created a stimulating factor for the nervous Shanghai market. Secondly, the recent bleak situation in the Northeast also has a stimulating effect on people's minds. Speaking of this, he gave an example: Recently, because of the complex and confusing international relations, the New York stock market, which has always been a downstream market, has also revealed signs of weakness. Finally, he said that he was waiting for the orders of the central authorities so that he could follow them!</p>
<p>Leaving the</p>
<p>Financial Commissioner's Office, I stepped into the gate of the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office. The Grain Commissioner, Yang Xizhi, flew to Nanjing early the day before yesterday. The purpose of this trip was to discuss emergency grain administration measures with Grain Vice-Minister Pang Songzhou and others. The reporter was received by a senior official of the office and asked why the Grain Administration had repeatedly devalued and sold *wu xian* rice to the rice market, but rice merchants had not publicly sold the devalued *wu xian* rice. It was also faintly heard that the large batch of *wu xian* rice that the Grain Administration had sold to the rice merchants at 8,000-9,000 yuan per *shi* was still in the warehouse and had not been put on the market. Could the rice merchants who purchased the devalued *wu xian* rice be forced to add a legitimate profit and quickly bring it to the market? He said that Commissioner Yang's trip to Nanjing to discuss with Vice-Minister Pang would definitely have good emergency measures. He believed that the new measures would definitely have ways to improve the various problems mentioned by the reporter.</p>
<p>Yesterday</p>
<p>morning, the police bureau was ordered to send officers to the Securities Exchange Building to notify each securities firm to remove the intercom telephones. If they did not comply, the Public Utilities Bureau would forcibly remove them. At around 11 o'clock, someone was dealing in the bond market on the seventh floor. The market was booming, and the market was one-sided with demand exceeding supply. Suddenly, four policemen came, and four or five people who were doing transactions were arrested. Yesterday, the General Headquarters took temporary emergency measures to devalue flour by 6,000 yuan per bag and sell it off completely without restriction. People's hearts relaxed, and the price of flour stopped rising and started to fall. The Grain Administration also posted an emergency announcement in the rice market, restricting non-professionals from entering the market for trading. The market gate became heavily guarded… It cannot be said that the authorities are not interfering with the speculative market!</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>the shoeshine boy on the street raised his head and said to the reporter with full confidence: The only lesson the eight years of war taught him was to get rid of banknotes and hoard materials! The rickshaw puller, when negotiating prices with the reporter, also rattled off his set of bargaining arguments: "Rice is going to be 300 yuan per *sheng*! Do you know that?" The stores on the roadside with "Internal Reorganization, Temporarily Closed for a Few Days" signs are gradually increasing. The clerks in the gold shops are all lazily leaning against the counter. A villager wearing homespun, with a bulging money belt around his waist, approached and pleaded to sell a small ring. The clerk raised his righteous posture and said: We abide by the law and do not do business. The rice in the rice shops, good or bad, only has one kind left. It's up to you whether you want it or not… All this that cannot be exhausted is also fact.</p>
<p>The reporter</p>
<p>couldn't help but feel confused? Will victory ultimately dawn on Shanghai? The price paid by the five million citizens for victory seems can't be snatched away by the adventurers in the paradise! It looks like the central authorities will not be without emergency measures, but these measures must come as quickly as thunder covers the ears, and this stick must be struck thoroughly to make Shanghai a truly permanent paradise.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Workers' Strike Still Unresolved; Reaches Stalemate Yesterday; National Official and Commercial Telegrams Suspended for Two Hours</h3>
<p>The work slowdown at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, which has been ongoing, remained at a stalemate as of 6:00 PM last night and has not been resolved. Military telegrams, news telegrams, and weather reports were all suspended for a period of time from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. However, after 3:00 PM, they continued to be maintained. At 6:00 PM, the employees convened a general meeting again to jointly discuss sending representatives to continue their request to the bureau. If the two sides can come closer, work can be resumed at any time.</p>
<p>Arbitration Requested for Newspaper Industry Dispute</p>
<p>The newspaper workers in this city have a dispute with the newspaper offices over their request for higher pay. The Social Bureau convened labor and management for mediation twice, but ultimately, due to the issue of the base wage, the two sides were too far apart and failed to reach an agreement, so the mediation was declared unsuccessful. As a result, the Social Bureau agreed that the base wage should be 45, calculated based on the rise and fall of the worker's cost of living index. The mediation agreement has been sent to both labor and management, but the newspaper offices still feel that the base wage agreed by the Social Bureau is too high and cannot afford it, and have applied to the Municipal Government for arbitration. The work strike at the Commercial Press has been completely resolved and business has resumed as usual from 9:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Cotton Spinning Strike Situation Expands</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The cotton spinning industry strike in the third and fourth districts and the weaving industry strike. Labor and management cannot approach each other, and the situation has become deadlocked. Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, 50 factories in the two districts went on strike one after another, with up to 70,000 workers participating. The Social Bureau will mediate again today. Other labor-management disputes and work slowdowns that have occurred include: (1) Employees of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company requested improved benefits and petitioned the Social Bureau for mediation. As a result, an agreement has been reached on the issues of working hours and holiday pay. (2) The mechanical personnel of China Airlines went on strike yesterday afternoon, requesting the company to adjust the cost of living to the level line. (3) All employees of the Shanghai branch of Minsheng Industrial Company went on strike on the day before yesterday to request improved benefits. All ships sailing in Shanghai yesterday did not depart. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of both sides continued to meet and negotiate, and as a result, opinions have become closer. The workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory at the intersection of Gordon Road and Macau Road went on strike yesterday because their request for a wage increase was not granted.</p>
<h3>Social Service; Severely Damaged Areas in the South City and Zhabei; Feces and Urine Flow Everywhere, Pollution is Alarming</h3>
<p>The Health of Five Million Citizens is at Stake, Urgent Cleaning is Needed</p>
<p>Dear Editor: It has been brought to my attention that this city, previously occupied by enemy bandits, suffered major damage in the old South City and Zhabei areas. Most of the houses were destroyed, and ruins and broken tiles are everywhere. After a long period of abandonment, they have been used for accumulating garbage, which has become increasingly widespread, reaching several feet high in some places. The situation continues to deteriorate and is extremely polluted. Furthermore, most of our compatriots disregard public hygiene and further spoil the dirty places, even using them as latrines, resulting in feces and urine flowing everywhere, making the filth even worse. Passing through these areas, the stench is unbearable! It is found that the population in this area has increased sharply since the victory, and it is closely connected with the old concession area. However, our municipal authorities, perhaps due to insufficient personnel, have not yet paid attention to rectifying the sanitation issues in this area. Although the winter season has barely passed, the outbreak of epidemics is already foreseen at the beginning of spring, which is obvious. However, the humid summer will arrive soon, and the garbage and feces will be exposed to the sun and wind, and the foul air will evaporate and spread everywhere. Flies and mosquitoes will gather, breed, and spread germs, which will inevitably spread like wildfire. At that time, we will see vicious epidemics raging and out of control. It will be too late to prevent them. The lives of the people are like grass, and the suffering is unbearable to imagine! The harm to the health of five million citizens is extremely serious. Thinking of this, I feel particularly fearful. Recently, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared in the temporary capital that public health should be listed as the first step in national revival and construction. Readers, with the qualifications of Shanghai citizens, have written letters to complain, appealing to send personnel for detailed inspection and immediately order the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Health and Public Works Bureaus to be responsible for clearing the garbage and ruins in the area within a limited time to ensure public health for the entire city. Five million citizens will share the benefits, and national health will depend on it. I have always admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare and service to the people. I am sending another letter, please publish it and I urge all the Shanghai news industry authorities and medical experts to write articles, encourage publicity, and promote our compatriots to pay attention to prevention, especially our municipal authorities. It is urgent to strictly stipulate penalty rules, supervise the subordinate agencies, and use the Baojia system to jointly promote and implement effective results, which will be immeasurable merit. The society is fortunate. I respectfully wish you good writing. Respectfully, a reader of Shenbao</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the National Foreign Relations Association Sends Telegram Urging the Soviet Ambassador to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Foreign Relations Association, regarding the increasingly deteriorating Northeast issue, in addition to inviting experts to hold a symposium as soon as possible, has also sent a telegram to the Chongqing General Association, urging the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing to pay attention to the intense emotions of our people and to take into account the facts as soon as possible to express a mutually beneficial and equal attitude, in order to reduce deeper misunderstandings between China and the Soviet Union. It has also issued a declaration in Chinese, English, and Russian, making a solemn statement, and it is also reported that it will join with Shanghai cultural groups within days to make a strong claim for the government to adopt.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Telephone Calls to Securities Exchange Removed, "Sha Chi" Prices Still Rising; US Dollar Also a Speculation Target</h3>
<p>"Sha Chi" transactions were even more secretive yesterday. People were extremely worried as the international situation continued to worsen. The buying frenzy remained strong, and authorities cracked down even harder. Only a few firms were engaged in buying and selling, and floating capital poured into foreign currencies. After "Sha Chi" reached high prices, it entered a consolidation phase. The general trend was not as lively as the US dollar. It was found that morning opened had already jumped to around 1.85 million, and at the highest point, it was pushed to around 1.95 million. Taking advantage of the high prices, there was a flow of cutting losses and hedging US dollars, once falling back to 1.82 million. At noon, it was about 1.88 million, a further increase of 230,000 compared to the previous close. The afternoon then gradually stabilized, but the prices and transactions were very chaotic. First, it was seen at around 1.93 million, but after the intercom telephones were removed and the crackdown intensified, it retreated to the 1.9 million mark. Decorated gold had no market, and silver jumped to 2,000 yuan. Silver dollars once rose to 1,200, and finally 1,100, with private trading from 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>Stimulated by the wild jump in the gold market, the foreign currency US dollar was brought up as soon as the market opened. Some of the floating capital gradually showed fatigue with the gold market, and the US dollar was first favored. At the same time, there was a steady demand for US cotton and material settlements. It rose in a fluctuating manner. Hedging against gold gradually rose from 750 yuan per 10 taels to slightly more than 700 yuan. The morning opening was remembered to have jumped to over 2,500 yuan, and settlements were eager. There were more monks than porridge, and it gradually rose to 2,750 yuan, and then the gold market brought it down to around 2,650 yuan, hovering around. In the afternoon, it rose again to over 2,700, resulting in a further increase of 340 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also affected by settlement, and old goods rose to around 430 yuan, resulting in an increase of 60 yuan. In addition to being brought up by old goods, new goods were also favored by speculators, and also rose by 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Still Jumping Wildly Under Mobile Gatherings; It is Heard that Someone in the Industry Has Been Arrested</h3>
<p>Public bonds were still being absorbed by scattered floating capital, initially stabilizing and then strengthening. After a high point, it slightly declined due to the more severe crackdown. Class C gradually rose from 1,720 yuan to 2,080 yuan, and finally struggled below 1,950 yuan. As a result, Class A, B, and D each improved by 230 yuan, Class C rose by 200 yuan, and Class E rose by 250 yuan. Yesterday, there were mobile gatherings with liquidity in Shanghai stocks. Yongsha jumped wildly from 2,500 yuan to near the 3,000 yuan mark. Meiya rose from 2,200 yuan to 2,400 yuan, and Jingfu rose from 130 yuan to 147 yuan. Then, it was heard that someone in the industry had been arrested, and it quickly fell back. Large stocks fell back by more than 10%, and small stocks fell by about half, but compared to the previous close, they still rose sharply by about 20%. Foreign stocks were also brought up by 15% to 20%, but the transactions were few and far less than stocks and bonds.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cloth Buying Fever</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rose wildly. From the opening to the closing, the buying was extremely strong in a fervent atmosphere. 20-count yarn of each brand rose by 150,000 to 200,000, and 42-count also jumped by 300,000. Looking at the closing, the prices of various counts of yarn generally rose by 15% to 20%.</p>
<p>The cloth market leaped like a swimming dragon. It is said that the gray cloth market repeatedly called for high prices, and the sales of colored cloth, such as blue cloth, were only enough to cover the cost of gray cloth. Dyeing was equivalent to being given away for free. Seeing this situation, the factories were particularly tight on prices. Although the customers had the appetite to absorb, there was no way to enter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton trading was less colorful, but the market price was frequently strong. Those who held goods tightened their prices extremely tightly, so it was difficult for both buyers and sellers to approach negotiations, so the transaction was a little sparse, and the price rose another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Surged Fiercely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market rose even more fiercely than the previous day. The high-grade five-dan head was bid as high as 2.8 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was a transaction at 2.6 million yuan, which was also a "kicking the ball" business. The mid-grade lingzu was 2.4 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The dry-warp five-dan head was bid 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day, but there was no transaction. 120 Tianqiao ren silk spot was traded at 2.6 million yuan in the morning, and the off-site price was reduced by 100,000 yuan in the afternoon, and finally fell by another 100,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Stocks of dull-finish and semi-luster goods were extremely scarce, and prices were raised. 120 Tianqiao dull-finish was bid at 3 million yuan, and the price of miscellaneous brand semi-luster goods was the same as Tianqiao luster. The prices of heavy goods continued to rise. The Meiya quilt cover and Dacheng gebi crepe both rose by 10%, and Minsheng brocade rose by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Confused</h3>
<p>The rice and grain market yesterday still lacked formal transactions. The early market was chaotic. Although there was little trading at noon, neither merchants nor shops officially traded. Cheap flour was selling well, and factory flour and miscellaneous brand flour fell by 600-700 yuan. Yih Wah Foreign Company has ordered 600 tons of Australian flour, estimated at around 6,000 yuan, to be shipped in March. The oil market increased by 5,000-6,000 yuan, soybeans increased by 2,000-3,000 yuan, raw kernels increased by 2,000 yuan, bean cakes increased by 1,000 yuan, wheat bran increased by 500-600 yuan, and persimmon cakes increased by 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Women and the Family</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The relationship between women and the family has always seemed much closer than that of men. Although a family cannot be formed by women alone without men, the traditional custom is for women to manage household affairs while men work outside. Therefore, the terms "women" and "family" are naturally linked together.</p>
<p>However, women in the family must not think that there is no place for women in society and politics apart from the family. Society is composed of many "individuals," and in theory, women account for half of the world's population. As for the political arena, women have had less involvement in the past. However, in recent years, after women in various countries have obtained the right to vote, they have often demonstrated the power to influence politics. After World War II, French women gained the right to vote, and as a result, women gained thirty-two seats. The number of women voters also exceeded that of men. Japanese women will soon gain the right to vote. It is estimated that the number of Japanese women who have the right to vote will also exceed the number of men. It can be seen that the political potential of women is enormous. Women compatriots must not underestimate their own strength.</p>
<p>Hygiene</p>
<h3>Developing Hygienic Habits in Children</h3>
<p>— Tracing the Cause</p>
<p>The term "hygiene" has been introduced into our country for decades. Due to active promotion and publicity in writing, speech, and action (such as the personal street sweeping led by the Municipal Council), almost everyone, from the intellectual class to porters and vendors, knows it and uses it as a buzzword. There's "hygienic soy sauce," "hygienic fermented bean curd," and even those Shaoxing old officials selling dried tofu in the streets and alleys add the word "hygienic" to the titles of five-spice or mushroom tofu. As for whether those foods are actually "hygienic," heaven knows! Often, when someone dumps garbage or feces in the sewers or outside the trash cans in the neighborhoods, and others or the neighborhood managers see it, they ask, "Do you understand hygiene?" Well, who doesn't understand "hygiene?" It's just that Chinese people understand but don't practice. There is a big gap between knowledge and practice.</p>
<p>This is not only the case in the lower classes, but also among the middle and upper classes who have received education and have a considerable understanding of the meaning of "hygiene." Many of them also have bad habits such as spitting, urinating, and littering, as well as various unhygienic phenomena expressed in clothing, food, housing, and other aspects, which are not much better than those of the general lower classes. A friend once told me that his comprador, while lying in a rocking chair and talking to a foreigner, often coughed up phlegm and simply turned his head and spat it on the ground. My friend felt ashamed and uneasy when he saw it, but the comprador looked calm and unconcerned! Although it was not my friend who spat, he felt that he shared this shame because he and the comprador were both Chinese!</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, the crux of the problem of why they know but cannot act lies in their lack of hygienic habits. Because they grew up in traditional unhygienic family environments, their parents did not teach them hygienic habits. When they grow up, although they have hygiene knowledge, the habits of laziness and casualness have already been formed. To ask them to abide by hygiene rules is simply to torture them. They believe that these hygiene rules are just theories and high-sounding words in books that cannot be practiced in the real environment. "Everyone else does it, so I can't be an exception." "It's too much trouble to follow these hygiene rules all the time." Indeed, it is too tiring for someone who does not have this habit to pay attention to and comply with hygiene rules at all times.</p>
<p>Therefore, to have a hygienic life, it is not enough to simply understand the meaning of hygiene. We must also have hygienic habits. The earlier this habit is cultivated, the better, because the younger the age, the greater the plasticity, and the easier and more deeply rooted the habit is to cultivate. If we wait until bad habits have formed and then try to correct them, it is like drawing irregular lines on a blank sheet of paper, erasing them with an eraser, and then drawing regular lines. The regular lines cannot be clear and distinct. From the moment a baby is born, their body should be kept clean and dry, and they should start to develop clean habits of skin touch. When they are a little older, they should be washed and have their noses wiped often. When the child understands, they should be taught to wash and wipe automatically—you may think it is more convenient for you to wash and wipe for them than for them to do it themselves, but you must never do this—and make them aware of what is clean and what is dirty. They should not be allowed to use their hands to hold wet and greasy things when eating. If their hands get greasy with oil, sugar juice, or salty brine, they must be washed immediately, otherwise they should not be allowed to pull and tug at things or scratch their heads and ears. Many children's skin diseases are caused in this way—although we may not be able to see anything on the body with our eyes, the child's sensitive skin will feel the irritation, causing itching, and the itching will break the skin, allowing germs to enter. This can lead to sores, scabies, and the like.</p>
<p>When children grow to a certain age and have a certain amount of physical strength, they should be taught to wash their own towels, clothes, socks, and to sweep and wipe, etc. This will not only cultivate their cleaning habits, but also allow them to learn to work and exercise their physical strength, so that they will not be dependent on servants in the future and have the habits of young masters and young ladies. Other good hygienic habits, such as getting up early, going to bed early, eating on time, going to the toilet on time, bathing often, changing clothes, not spitting, urinating, littering, covering the mouth with a head or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and not using public towels, cups, plates, etc., should be cultivated from childhood. Then, habit becomes nature, and adults can follow various hygiene rules at any time and place without having to use conscious effort to control themselves. Not only will they enjoy the happiness of health and maintain a clean and polite appearance because of this, but they will also not hinder the hygiene and health of others.</p>

<h3>Arguments Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Arguments between husband and wife are unavoidable. Many people think that when an argument occurs in a family, everything is over. In fact, this does not correspond to the facts. A Mr. Hubbard once wrote in the American Women's Family Magazine that if a couple has been together for twenty-five years without arguing, then they seem to lack spirit. Rather than saying that arguments are the end of everything, it is more accurate to say that arguments are the beginning of everything.</p>
<p>Because behind every argument, there must be a considerable problem. These problems are waiting to be resolved. If they are not resolved, then enduring them will only produce deeper pain.</p>
<p>At the same time, if a couple is always perfunctory in order to avoid arguments, it is somewhat close to hypocrisy. A couple must not be hypocritical to have a happy life. Therefore, if there is any problem that must be discussed, it is perfectly fine to discuss it, even to the point of arguing. However, after the argument, a solution can be found.</p>
<p>Therefore, arguments between husband and wife can be divided into two types: positive and negative. Positive arguments are centered on the problem. After the argument, a solution can be found. Negative arguments are a type of unreasonable disturbance.</p>
<p>During an argument, one party is the attacker and the other is the resister. This resister actually has a moral responsibility, that is, they should analyze whether the other party's argument is due to illness, stimulation, or nervous unease. If the argument is due to these reasons, then one must have some tolerance so that the argument can subside in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Normally, arguments can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the beginning. At the beginning, it is just a minor dispute. But if it cannot be stopped, then it will enter the second stage, which is a fierce debate, including sarcasm, etc. Arguments often occur at night. After a night, because the spirit is more peaceful, the atmosphere will be calmer. Therefore, the second stage can be as short as a few minutes or as long as a few hours, depending entirely on the situation of the parties involved. The third stage is the ending stage. Everything has an end, even international wars have an end. After an argument, both parties hope to reconcile. At that time, as long as one party is willing to admit a little loss, the argument can be ended.</p>
<p>Therefore, since arguments are unavoidable in the family, we must know the process of arguments and handle them appropriately. (This article is an excerpt from Mr. Xu Baiyi's lecture on family problems at the Qingnian Wenhua Dianhe Academic Forum)</p>

<p>Knowledge</p>
<h3>Home Cooking School</h3>
<p>— Qi Hong</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Ding Xiuzhen went to Columbia University in the United States for further study after graduating from McTyeire School. At that time, she realized the importance of home economics to women's lives, so she studied it carefully. After returning to China, she served as a cooking instructor at her alma mater and Aurora College for Women. Because some students sought tutoring after class, she founded the Home Cooking School, located at No. 4, Gao'enfang, Daxing Road (at the intersection of Avenue Lafayette and Route Massenet), Shanghai. She teaches the preparation of various Chinese and Western dishes and pastries. At first, there were only five students, but it has gradually increased to more than 100. Students can be divided into three types: high school or university girls, working women, and housewives. The school is divided into five classes, with about 25 people in each class. The class time is chosen to be most convenient for most students, each class lasting from two to three hours. In class, Mrs. Wang first explains the items, cooking methods, and things to be used, and then the students automatically cook according to the method. She is always on hand to point out the tricks for successful cooking and the problems with various failures. After the cooking is completed, the whole class shares the food together, and then the expenses for that experiment are divided equally according to the number of people. So the interest is very strong.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang believes that even in the 20th century, in the age of advanced science, women should still return to the kitchen. She said: Just look at the married women in Europe and the United States, and you can say that not one of them does not know how to cook. This is clear evidence that women and the kitchen are inseparable. As far as the current society is concerned, only a very small number of working women are exclusively engaged in careers, while more than 90% are still housewives. A housewife hopes that her family is a place full of joy and happiness, and health is the primary condition for a happy family. To make a family healthy, the most important thing to pay attention to is the daily diet.</p>
<p>A virtuous housewife must know how to make her husband feel the snacks given by the family, and there must be a very good arrangement so that he will feel satisfied and will not mess around outside, and he will have more interest in work. Therefore, cooking can directly help housewives to organize a healthy and happy family, and indirectly help society and the country, because a healthy family can produce promising young people.</p>
<p>She also said that most of the housewives in our country have forgotten their responsibilities and only know how to socialize and gamble all day long. They can be said to be completely ignorant of housework. They give their children to servants to manage or send them to school. As for their usual behavior and grades at school, they don’t care at all. They think that the responsibility of teaching their children should be entirely borne by the school. This erroneous concept deprives their children of the most important and precious family education. This negligence has resulted in all kinds of criminals and destroyed countless young people. Therefore, she has a plan, that is, after she can recover a house occupied by Russians on Avenue Joffre, she not only prepares to expand the cooking department, but also to add sewing and children's education departments, so that women in our country can further understand the knowledge of housework and childrearing. Regarding this plan, she feels that she cannot do it alone, so her students can give her a helping hand.</p>
<p>I think that the establishment of such a home economics school is what the women in our country are eagerly awaiting, especially at this time of national construction, so I hope that in addition to Mrs. Wang's students, everyone should give it the greatest help so that it can be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<h3>Save the Children!</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yi</p>
<p>"Save the children!" This is the last sentence of Mr. Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman." This powerful and sincere cry, recognizing the warmth and honesty in children's hearts, was spoken more than twenty years ago. Before the war, there was the slogan "The 20th century is the century of the child." After eight years of the War of Resistance, this slogan has gradually faded, replaced by "The 20th century is the century of adults." The future adults are children, but what are the lives of children like now? Just look at the corpses of children lining the streets, the beggars at restaurant doors, the candy sellers in theaters, the newsboys with hoarse voices, the child laborers in factories; some skillfully smoking cigarettes, playing poker, spreading bad habits; parents venting their anger after returning home, often unreasonably scolding them. In wealthy families, children are abandoned and entrusted to ignorant maids, while the parents indulge in entertainment all day long, or are excessively doting. In schools, the rigid, rote learning and regulated education are greatly at odds with the development of children's nature.</p>
<p>Now people demand democracy, and children also demand life—respecting children, encouraging the development of their activities, with guidance and more reasonable living and education; pay attention to the children!</p>

<h3>A New Life Begins at Home</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>The publication of this issue of our journal coincides with New Life Movement Week, and at the same time, the goals of various countries are shifting towards the family. For example, this newspaper recently published the following news:</p>
<p>First, our reporter, Mai Tian, ​​specially visited Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who said: "Many people often overlook the status and importance of housewives. In fact, this is wrong. The responsibility of housewives is very important, especially during the War of Resistance. They not only have to take care of their husbands and children and manage household affairs, but also constantly help their husbands with their work. Their contribution to the country is indeed equal to that of their husbands."</p>
<p>Second, Mayor Qian also said in his article "Looking Ahead to the Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life Movement": "The New Life Movement promotes a disciplined life of 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.' Practice these virtues in daily life—in the 'four essentials of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation.'"</p>
<p>Third, in order to strengthen the promotion of family education, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated that all levels of public education centers throughout the country should take the promotion of family education as their main task, and other social education institutions at all levels should each use their strengths to promote family education.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our country must immediately embark on the stage of construction, which is the process of regulating the family and governing the country. To govern the country, one must first regulate the family, which is indeed the most suitable approach in this era, because the organization of our society is based on the family as a unit. If every family can practice the New Life Movement, and every family can devote itself to family education, then every family will be forward-looking and full of vigor. Our social atmosphere will naturally not be corrupt and decadent. Therefore, for the sake of one's own happiness and the future of the nation, practicing the New Life Movement is truly the minimum responsibility that everyone should bear.</p>

<h3>The Miao People of a Matriarchal Society</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yi</p>
<p>We usually think that the Miao people all live in the remote mountains of the northwest provinces. Recently, a friend who came from the rear told me that the deep mountains of Jingning County, Zhejiang Province, are also inhabited by this ethnic group.</p>
<p>In our imagination, the Miao people must be uncouth, fierce, brave, belligerent, addicted to alcohol, suspicious, and vengeful savages. However, the reality is quite the opposite. The Miao people of Jingning County are extremely gentle, peace-loving, and speak very softly. They live in the deep mountains, and if strangers come to the mountains and shout loudly, they dare not even be seen. When you arrive at their door, you must speak in a low voice and humbly, and then they will dare to invite you to sit down. Once you become familiar with them, they will often make gifts, but they are all crude and inedible. They wear summer cloth all year round, even in the dead of winter, and even the quilts they use are made of several layers of summer cloth. They eat things like sweet potatoes. The mountain land is barren, and there are no rice fields to cultivate, but they are extraordinarily strong, far beyond our abilities. The furniture is simple, very similar to the poorest people in our clan.</p>
<p>The Miao people's system is a matriarchal society, where women's rights are above all else. All financial and labor matters are the responsibility of women; men manage children at home, manage household affairs, and take on chores such as cooking, so men are extremely idle.</p>
<p>There is a female chieftain who wears gold, silver, and jewelry on her head, and wears embroidered clothes. It is said that she was appointed by the Manchu Qing emperor. The Miao people must obey her orders.</p>
<p>Miao people's marriages are extremely free. Every year on a certain day, they gather to sing and dance under the moon. Men and women gather, all wearing red and green clothes, singing and dancing, choosing their own spouses. The man stays at the woman's house for three days and then returns to his own home. If the woman becomes pregnant, the marriage is settled.</p>

<h3>The Organization of Nurses</h3>
<p>— Xue Yi</p>
<p>All members of various groups with the same goals, problems, and needs should organize themselves and formulate policies, rules, and order. Everyone shares the benefits of their duties, and achieves their social goals through appropriate methods. Group activities are very important for nurses, proving that nurses can be responsible for guiding nursing work, without entrusting the responsibility to other groups, or letting it go naturally without intervention. Nurses in all countries of the world have organizations. Our country's national organization, originally named "Chinese Nurses Association," was established in 1912. Although the nursing profession was introduced by Ms. Miet in 1884, Chinese women were not yet liberated at that time, and those who received education did not leave their homes, so progress was not easy. In 1908, nurses from Western countries in various church hospitals began to prepare, but there was not much progress in the first three years. In 1912, the registration methods for nursing schools, standard courses, national meetings, and the issuance of nurses' diplomas were agreed upon, and it was proposed to hold a national nurses' conference in Shanghai in 1914. This conference was indeed realized, thus laying the foundation for the organization of nurses in our country, and in 1922 it joined the International Council of Nurses as a member, equal to nurses from other countries, which invisibly improved the status of our nurses. It is now renamed "Chinese Nursing Association." The work of the group is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Nursing students, that is, students of nursing schools. When the Nurses Association was established, its purpose was to unify the curriculum and examinations of nursing schools across the country and improve the level of nursing. The work includes: (A) Revising old books at any time to suit modern trends; (B) Holding nurses' exams, and issuing diplomas to those who pass, to show fairness; (C) Handling transfer procedures to prevent students from dropping out halfway; (D) Writing and translating various nursing textbooks for students; (E) Investigating registered schools every two years, and providing instructions on what should be established and reformed at any time; (F) Handling the registration of schools; (G) Opening schools with donations from the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China to open nursing schools in Guiyang, Lanzhou, and Chongqing, which can train more nursing talents to meet the needs of wartime and construction.</p>
<p>(2) Nurses, the outline of the work is to increase the benefits of nurses and connect feelings: (A) Filing the Chinese Nurses Association diploma with the International Council of Nurses so that the Chinese nurses' diploma can be effectively used both domestically and abroad; (B) Convening a national nurses' association at a certain time so that representatives from all over the country have the opportunity to express their opinions; (C) Seeking the equal status of our country's nurses in the international nursing community; (D) Publishing a nurses' quarterly or newsletter so that nurses from all over the country can communicate with each other to publish their personal work experience and all experiences, so that they can benefit each other; (E) Planning the status of nurses in the country and requesting government recognition; (F) Opening nurses' refresher courses for further study; (G) Negotiating with various countries for nursing scholarships so that nurses in our country can study abroad for further study. After the government returns to the capital and various careers are on track, a nursing study abroad examination will be held, and members of the association are qualified to participate; (H) Handling nurses' registration matters; (I) Scholarships are donated from abroad to encourage and comfort the badly injured who serve in the border areas; (J) Providing relief to nurses who are unemployed due to war and finding jobs for them.</p>
<p>(3) To the country and society: (A) Cultivating talents to meet the needs of society, so that patients can get the best care in the institution and recover their health as soon as possible, and at the same time, healthy people can maintain their health, that is, to enable everyone to enter the path of health; (B) So that the entire society can obtain common sense of hygiene and medicine, because nurses are the vanguard of health teachers; (C) To add glory to the country, because our country's nurses already have a place in the international nursing community.</p>
<p>The association has a clubhouse in Nanjing, which was built by donations from nurses. The building is magnificent and the equipment is beautiful. Since the establishment of the association, there have been no less than tens of thousands of members, scattered throughout the country.</p>
