<p>〔本報北平十日電日馬歇爾最近即將返華，故周恩來留渝，候晤馬氏，未來平，據中共方面陳士渠少將談：周未來平之另一重要原因，爲八日赴延飛機在西安附近失事，王若飛，秦邦憲，葉挺及由歐出席勞工會議歸來之共方代表鄧發等俱遇難，周須在渝予以料理，且目前共方在渝代表僅剩周與陸定一兩人，彼勢難離開，重慶方面尙有甚多事項須周與各方接洽。</p>

<h3>蔣主席在貴陽　昨親巡視省府及省黨部　並赴貴大發表感人演說</h3>
<p>〔中央社貴陽十日電〕蔣主席九日抵筑，安度一宵寗靜生活，十日晨九時卅分先驅車赴黔省府巡視，楊主席森親率各廳長曁省府全體職員約二百餘人，在省府門前恭迎，主席專車於歡迎樂聲中抵達省府，恭迎人員肅立致敬，主席頷首答禮。楊氏即率各　長陪同隨行，在客廳稍事休息，略詢黔省民政及交通情形，即巡視省府各辦公室及毗鄰省府之黔省保安司令部，再驅車一視黔雀黨部，旋即馳赴距筑十八公里之風景區花溪遊覽，楊氏隨行。十時四十分到達，在該處逗留的四小時，曾往已故戴安瀾師長之遺孤處慰問，並赴國立貴州大學，在該校禮堂對全校師生作親切而感人之演說，啓示貴州爲西南重鎭，建設貴州須要造就人才，當設法充實該校，使成爲現代學府。詞畢，該校全體師生歡呼鼓掌達三分鐘，主席旋即欣然離該校返行邸休息，於二時三十分返貴陽，專車過市區順便巡視三民主義靑年團黔支團部後，逕返黔靈山釐行邸時，已三時三十分矣，晚飯後並乘肩與，登靈黔靈山遊覽，狀至愉快。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蔣主席於今日下午一時許，蒞臨貴州大學召見張校長及各院院長訓導長等，垂詢校務，對各員生生活情形，極爲關切，旋對該校全體員生一千餘人，作簡短之訓話，略謂：「七日本席來貴校，見到各學生精神勇奮，身體健康，心中至爲快慰。回想十一年前，本席初到貴州時，貴州民衆多染　癖，以致面黃肌瘦，貧弱不堪，今日一般靑年健康活潑，情形幾有隔世之感，由此可見我們貴州同胞，進步的迅速，這是本席最感安慰之事。現貴州的經濟地位，雖不如川滇，然貴州適居西南各省中心，地勢重要，加之礦藏豐富，若能努力開發，加緊建設，將來必能成爲西南之重鎭，而成為民族復興的重要根據地。本席廿四年到貴州時，對貴州有四大願望，即（一）肅淸烟毒，（二）開發礦藏，（三）發展交通與（四）提高文化。現在除第一項已有大體完成外，其他三項或正在進行，或尙未開始。貴校爲貴州學府，常爲貴州造就人才，以爲建設新貴州的幹部，本席當設法充實貴校的設備，使成爲現代的學府，同時亦望貴校全體師生，刻苦耐勞，安心敎學，養成堅毅不拔的精神，具備現代枓學的知識，然後完成本席的願望，建設三民主義的新貴州」。</p>
<p>蔣主席離渝前　對外記者談話</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶八日電〕（遲到）蔣主席今日接見合衆社記者時稱：如美國繼續擔任其領導世界之任務，則聯合國機構可以成功。中國以方正之態度，站於聯合國機構之後，但目前中國政府各領袖，並不以爲單靠聯合國機稱而並無各民主國家之積極支持，即可保持和平。世界各國務須永加警惕，以維民主制度。主席相信國共會談之聯合政府，可於短期內獲得成就。並闡明謂：共產黨及其他各黨派，應獻身予中國之福利整個問題，不應作「內部破壞」之企圖。主席接見合衆社記者時，神彩奕奕，精神甚見康健。關於中蘇關係問題，主席謂：去年八月間，中國曾以友善誠意訂立中蘇友好條約，希望遵守條約規定。關於國內情形，並不因通貨膨脹，經濟紊亂與某種程度之社會不安，而對將來表示悲觀。繼謂，交通已恢復，國外供應亦米，不出數月，情形當可改善。中國經濟之復興，幾全恃美國所供應之各急需物資運來之速度而定。苟新政府可以組成，及國內情勢允許時，本人希望訪美一行，屆時將至少在美國勾留一個月云。接談時間，歷一小時有餘。</p>
<h3>吳國楨劉鍇答外記者　中美商約即簽訂　溥儀將在瀋陽或長春引渡</h3>

<h3>馬歇爾週末返華　繼續努力促成國共合作　紐約傳馬帥將任國務卿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾在華促進和平之成就，在其返國述職期內，有呈瓦解之勢。國共兩方紛爭又起，共黨指責國民黨未履行政協所成立之協定，政府亦斥共軍阻止國軍接收東北，馬歇爾特使鑒於此種不利發展，現擬提早回任。一俟馬歇爾特使重返中國任所，呈現於世人目前者，至少當爲國共雙方外表上之息爭，馬氏離任期內，國共齟齬又吿積極，足見中國方面所推進之種種改革，尙未深刻，蓋馬氏返國後，曾於公私談話中明白表示，以爲中國之和平繫於世界贊成者半，繫於其自身復興發展者亦半，馬氏似擬始終其事，直至全功吿成而後已</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日電〕馬歇爾九日晨出席珍珠港事件審訊時，再度鄭重聲明其以前之證言，即故羅斯福總統於一九四一年十二月六日夜並未與彼通電話，彼是夜亦未參加白宮之參謀會議。又若美國致日皇之明令兌被其忽視時，故羅斯福總統擬於十二月九日向日本提出警吿一節，渠亦否認曾有所聞，審訊須至十一日晨始退庭，馬歇爾於本週末赴華之前，或將再度出庭。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約九日電〕國際統計局今日預測：美駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，不久將繼貝爾納斯任國務卿。此項預測並稱：美國務院之未來改變，勢將影響日本，而將採取較麥帥更强硬之政策。此外，在美軍撤離中國之後，美國將增加對中國國民政府之經濟及技術援助，而中國在美國支持之下，將拒絕承認蘇聯購置先前日本在東北所有或統制之配備。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶十日電〕載運中共代表王若飛·秦邦憲及葉挺等飛延安美機，於八日晨自渝起飛，當口國午過西安後，即與地面失云聯絡，迄今尙無消息，各方對此極表關發。航委會主任周至柔將軍，今特派偵察機兩架，於午後一時自西安出發，沿途搜尋，嗣以氣候惡劣，自空中俯視地面，模糊不淸，兩機乃中途折返，據周主任語記者，十一日當繼續派機出動搜尋。</p>

<h3>日技術員及韓橋頒命令限期遣送</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十日常〕中國陸軍總司令何應欽突頒命令兩道，一令遣送留備中國工業界用之日本技術人員，一令所有韓僑立即離華返國，致第十一戰區當局及主持遣送人員，日夜工作，不遑應付。此項命令，一反留用技術人員之政策，對於韓僑限期迫促，尤出人意外。華北韓僑不下五六萬人，統限於四月十五日以前至天津登輪，集中北平區內之一千七百人已於今晨乘火車赴津，惟此外尙未準備立即遵令實行。韓僑聯合會及代表漢城臨時政府之韓僑宣慰團，已提出抗議，謂限期如此迫促，將使僑民無充分時間料理私事及處分財產，僅北平區內已有韓人一萬五千至二萬五千名。國共兩方近方爭雇技術人員備鐵路及工業界之用，約計願留華北供軍事機關雇用之日本技術人員，其數不下五六千人，天津現有日俘日僑五萬人待運回國。</p>

<h3>日本全國昨普選　婦女投票頗踴躍　民主政治受初次試驗盟軍監視下秩序井然</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十日電〕今晨東京各報對於日本之普選，予以極大重視。淸晨美國憲兵駕各種車輛在街頭行駛，每輛上裝揚聲機二架，由日本人員高呼「人民莫忘投票選舉其自已之候選人」。盟國新聞記者四十人，偕麥帥總部政府組主任維脫尼將軍前往各選舉站，大部份投票站設於國民學校。日本之普選係由美國佔領軍所主持，是以每一投票站有美軍一名維持秩序。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕日本今日舉行普選，至午後六時結束，日本有史以來最守秩序之選舉，遂吿完成。根據尙未點畢之票數推測，東京市選舉人投票者，共的百分之六十五至七十，數處重要鄉區之投票數，百分率則較東京稍高。如果最後點票結果，與上述數字相符，則此次普選投票數，將較一九四二年强迫投票之普選，大爲減少，僅較一九三七年半受限制之普選，略勝一籌而已。今日淸晨，東京各投票所人頭擁擠，日方若干政治觀察家原來預料投票人佔百分之七十五者，爲之改變觀念，以爲將超出此數，惟午後投票人已見稀少。婦女投票者較預料為多，以東京市計，已逾百分之五十，原來預料僅稍逾百分之二十五而已。同時普選準確結果，非至明日，不能得悉。明日上午八時，開始開票，當夜可知一部份結果。尙有許多男婦，申請空白選舉票，但因最近人民遷移，登記工作未臻週全等緣故，不能投票，日本共產黨根據此種情形，已數度遊行，要求重新選舉，今後或將更堅決重提此項要求。截至午後三時爲止，東京男婦選舉人已投票者，各約百分之五〇·五，東京附近各區投票百分率，大致相同，惟迄今爲止，日本各地投票統計，均不完全。東京今日投票時，並無事故。四强管制日本委員會英方委員鮑爾，於今日午後赴東京四要區視察，並與辦理選舉工作官員談話，見投票情形頗爲寗靜，秧序井然。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十日電〕日本婦女參加選舉，在歷史上尙屬第一次。選舉前各方預測放棄投票者當在百分之六十至七十之間，但根據今晨婦女投票之情形，婦女之棄權者大致將在百分之三十與四十之間，殊出一般意料之外。據協同通訊社消息，截止今日下午二時，日本全國三千六百萬選民中，已有百分之六十五至七十投票矣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十日電〕日本今日舉行十年來第一次普選，東京布居民於灰暗天色下，前往各投票所投票，投票羣衆中，混有婦女及女孩甚多。多數投票站設在學校內，投票　置於白色木桌上，由日本官員及美國督察員監視投票。本社記者詢問一老年工人何以投票贊成社會黨，老人答稱「實在不知」。叧有一五十二歲之失業者亦投票贊成社會黨，據稱，「余從前常投票擁護淺沼，現在不似變更」。東京大多數居民顯然均投票贊成社會黨，但此種情形以大城市爲然。全團各地農民則依照傳統慣例，贊成舊日民政黨與政友會之替身，即現在之進步黨及自由黨是也。截至本日午後二時爲止，選民投票者已佔全數百分之七十五，新議會選出後，定五月十日舉行特別會議，討論新憲法及預算案。</p>
<h3>麥帥今日政府　恢復海關事務</h3>

<h3>撲滅東北的火種！</h3>
<p>儘管國民政府在七個多月來努力爭取國內的和平，儘管老百姓日夜祈禱着各黨派精誠團結，實現國內的和平統一，但終究似乎阻不住好亂性成的中國共產黨發動它圖窮七見的擾亂。儘管我們朝野上下大家認爲東北問題是外交問題，我們用堅忍刻制的功夫，委曲求全，從交涉的努力上獲得蘇聯軍隊本月底從東北九省完全撤退的保證，却終究不能感化中國共產黨，使它不利用艱苦的外交環境來阻撓國民政府的接收東北主權。在這樣的情勢下，東北局勢反隨蘇軍的撤退而更形緊張。中外人士都已認爲今後十天中的東北大局，可以影響中國全局的安危；而據昨天消息推測，我們誠恐東北擾亂的火種，如果不用快刀斬亂麻的手段迅速撲滅，則燎原之禍即在眉睫之間了！</p>
<p>我們從重慶電訊中，的略讀到中共解放日報和新華日報的怪論，居然誣詆國家元首抗戰領袖的　蔣主席爲「通敵賣國妥協投降」，無論那一個老百姓決不會相信他們的宜傳。然而他們畢竟爲什麼如大公報所說，作這樣的「過分宣傳」？其目的不外爲他們即將叛變硬製造出一種理由來罷了。故重慶世界日報批評「中共現在已經不是由中國人所組織的國內政黨，而完全是在替外國執行第五縱隊職務一羣暴徒，」實在是一針見血之論。我們以爲這一篇怪論就是中共存心在東北乃至全國各地玩火的信號。我們不許他們再玩火，就得趕快撲滅東北的火種。</p>
<p>再看東北共軍首領林彪的參謀長吳秀泉於八日在瀋陽對合衆社記者的談話，竟主張凡蘇軍撤離的東北地區，應由國共雙方軍隊共同接管，甚至敢說中蘇條約雖規定由中央政府軍隊向蘇軍接管，但這是蘇聯與中央政府間的事，而在東北若干地區，當地人民却已組有共軍，因此，關於接管問題，當地的共黨已組織有人民政府，且已以人民的名義接管，更無須國軍的開入。吳氏談話的用心，顯而易見，就是要以「人民政府」的幌子，阻礙國軍的接管。這不是存心割據東北，分裂國土，還有什麼可講？這不是在製造口實，以爲在東北樹起叛國的旗幟，還有什麼目的？中共之在今日，他們滿以爲在東北已埋下炸藥，只待引綫爆炸的了。</p>
<p>我們老百姓在勝利以後，看見這種景况，久已不耐煩。譬如一個病人，能够不開刀最好，如果病勢危險已非開刀不可，也只有開刀可望得救。我們眞不懂政府爲什麼老拖！東北的接管，依據中蘇條約，原是國民政府分內的事。中蘇條約之簽訂，布蘇聯爲蘇聯政府，在中國爲國民政府。蘇軍撤離東北，原應有國軍接防，那是毫無問題的事。在國民政府權力未曾到達東北以前，當地無論有什麽組織，有什麽軍隊，如不得國民政府的認可，均爲非法的組織，非法的軍隊。站在嚴正的立塲，國軍對於此種非法組織及非法軍隊，原應速予消滅。在實際上，這些於法無據的組織及軍隊如果仍在東北出現，此正足以表示政府的寬大爲懷，相忍為國。但老百姓只知國民政府爲中國惟一的合法政府，代表中國全體人民，而當地的「人民政府」無論假借什麽好聽的話，終不能代表中國人民全體。東北爲我國領土之一部，爲中國人之東北，而非東北人之東北，更非若干假借名義者之東北。國民政府代表中國人民全體前往接收，義正辭嚴，任何阻力，應予克服。</p>
<p>共黨原有一貫的作風，就是硬說國軍的目的不在對外而在對內。吳氏所說，國軍進據東北的目的在消滅共軍勢力，這不必待我們辯正。中共對於東北局勢，一再企圖將其轉變爲內政問題。在過去幾個月間，中共軍隊由熱河及山東半島方面紛紛進入東北，其目的即在建立叛國據點，造成旣成事實，以圖阻止國軍的接收。東北在友好蘇軍佔領之下而竟容許這種局勢的造成，我們固然覺得遺憾；中共在道種形勢之下，阻碍國軍的接收，其用心尤爲險惡。這明明是一種出賣民族利益以圖擴張自己地盤勢力的毒計！中國經長期的抗戰，出賣民族利益的漢奸羣已一一下獄，即將繩以國法，而此際尙有不顧民族利益的人企圖破壞國府對東北的接收，企圖破壞我國領土及主權的完整，是其居心，與往日的漢奸何殊？</p>
<p>我們於此際要正吿我們的盟邦：就是，中共的一貫作風是在破壞中國的統一，是在擴張其自己的勢力，將中國走向一個中國人民所不願走的方向。它的目的是與中國人民的利益及我們盟邦的利益不相容的。我們不能讓它畏此猖在下去！世界的和平繫於遠東，而遠東的和平却繫於一個在中國國民黨領導下的强有力的中國。扶植中共在中國的發展，是與中國人民的利益，世界的和平，以及盟邦的利益相違反的。馬歇爾元帥不久即將回華，我們希望這種中共存心在東北玩火的局勢能够根本改變過來。我們尤其希望這東北的火種在最近的將來能够迅速撲滅。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓九日電〕國務院發言人今日發表談話稱：美方爲答覆蘇聯之質問，已由國務院負責通知蘇駐美大使館，謂三月廿六日在奥勒岡州波特蘭被捕之蘇海軍軍官勒亭中尉，將由最高法院負責審理，此項案件之審訊工作，與國務院無關。發言人繼稱，蘇聯大使館表示謂據蘇方調査，勒亭實屬無辜，請予免究。蘇大使館並聲稱，勒亭將受美國法律之保護，任何審訊均應公九無私。</p>
<p>〔聯合社西雅圖十日電〕美聯邦陪審官刻對勒亭提出控訴，謂其犯五項罪狀，其中包括刺探有關美國國防之情報，敎唆他人刺探美國國防計劃，及共謀將此項國防計劃洩露於外國政府。傳勒亭上尉曾刺探有關美驅逐艦「黃石」號之情報，但其餘被牽涉各人，名單未予透露，起訴書中稱，勒亭行爲並非出於無意，相信勒亭企圖獲得之情報，將對美國有所不利，而叧一國家蘇聯則屬有利。</p>

<p>紀念　主席豐功偉績並含與民同樂之意</p>
<p>主編先生：三月二十七日閱貴報刋載，「跑馬廳將改建公園，當局正在接洽中」之新聞一則，不勝雀躍！跑馬廳原為一大賭窟，乃帝國主義經濟侵略之一例，亦我國歷史上之莫大恥辱，今當抗戰勝利，取消不平等條約之後，應不容此特殊區域依然存在。前曾上　主席建議書，亦有請將跑馬廳改爲「中正公園」，一則紀念　主席之豐功偉績，一則市民可以同樂，彼時在余爲理想，現將成事實，私心竊喜。今請市參議會及當局諸公於改建公園時，決以　主席雅篆爲園名，籌鑄銅像一座，俾萬民瞻仰，雖不能如廣東同胞鑄一金像，亦不讓其專美於前，並請迅速進行，於　主席六跌誕辰之前，改建完成，慶祝萬壽無疆，其意義至爲深長，鄙意如斯，是否有當，請各界人士亮察爲辛。讀者姚大田上</p>

<p>昨米市因天陰趨堅，粳秈米均略升三五百元，陰元貨稀，價升千元，白元仍平庸，收市各貨亦仍軟化，麵粉溫州靑島略有問津，價格見緊百元，麩皮內地消化蟬聯，亦漲百元，豆餅先漲後回，仍難向榮，黃豆早緊午懈，實消不振，生仁貨湧，消化呆木，下挫一一千元，芝蔴交易寥寥，下跌二三千元，菉豆平平，苞米胃呆，油市以來貨接連，疲而難立，生油小近千元，豆油續小一二千元，後情各糧仍看下游。</p>
<h3>美麥一萬噸　相繼到滬</h3>
<p>福來公司經理之威利姆傑陀尼號，由美來麥子六千餘噸，泊三十二·三十三號浮筒起卸。怡和洋行經理之匹披埃阿蘭克號，由溫哥華運來麥四千餘噸，因港內碼頭浮筒不空，暫在口外拋泊，俟港內船隻見少，即當進口。</p>
<h3>糖價不易轉機</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢依然軟弱，公會划盤中砂白初划四萬六千元，後爲四萬五千五百元，又小五百元，什路靑糖，號家零星開四萬八千元，什路白糖開五萬元，次之四萬八千元，普通冰糖九萬元，以近日客銷旣淡，行胃不佳，故暫時未易轉機。</p>
<h3>市塲謠傳美滙變動　當局鄭重否認</h3>

<p>又訊：外匯市塲因受連日金價頻跌影響，亦逐漸降低，今晨大通銀行美匯買價如次，電匯一八七〇元，支票一八六〇元，美票一八四〇元，對英匯率尙未經官方正式公佈，目前結算辦法，係按當日市價，另加匯水計算云。</p>
<p>又訊，據金融界方面息，吾國外匯基金，極爲充沛，除開放外匯時，政府已指撥五萬萬美元外，最近當局幷向美國洽借巨款，爲數頗巨，進行已將成熟，此款將作穩定我國幣制之用，故金融前途，殊可樂觀云。</p>

<h3>黃紹臨別致詞　檢討浙省敎育</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕浙省主席黃紹竑氏，此次榮調國府委員，行將離浙，省會各界特舉行歡送大會。茲探錄黃主席在大會中致詞，關於期望理想中之新浙江，須致力於基本的工作——教育一節，略謂：理想中之新浙江，要建立民主化和工業化，但是怎能做到民主化和工業化，非是一句空言可以成功，須要致力基本工作之敎育。前兩年對於浙省之建設，曾提出敎育年之口號，因爲敎育不普及，科學不發達，就不能達到工業化和民主化之目的。今後我們要眞正達到民主化和工業化之目的，必須在敎育方面切實用力推展。勝利以後，元首已提出「建國時期敎育第一」之口號，所以檢討浙江的敎育，近幾年來，雖有若干進展，但仍屬是表面上和數量上之成績，眞正要達到敎育普及，科學發達之目的，尙須力求敎育設備和內容之充實。今日趁臨別之時，竭誠盼望浙省地方父老，敎育當局，和靑年學生，對於敎育作根本上之努力，完成國家民族與浙江地方最偉大最光榮之使命云。（蝶）</p>

<h3>粵省參議員質詢救分署　清算一筆救濟帳</h3>
<p>— 四月一日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風寄</p>
<p>自從參政員在參政會三次大會中提出，「善後救濟總署廣東分署，對廣州災民坐視不救，廣州每日餓斃數十人，然其麵粉從未惠及平民，應如何改善？」的質詢後，即引起此間極大的注意，因這是廣東切身的事情，各方焉能忽視？故在這裏代表民意的機構——廣東省臨時參議會，在三月廿五日起舉行第二屆第四次大會中，排定在大會第四日的下午，舉行善後救濟分署施政報吿的節目。</p>
<p>受惠貧民能有幾人</p>
<p>精彩是無疑的，因該署自成立發放救濟物資以來，一般人士都認爲它辦理欠善，弊端重重，得有實惠的貧民能有幾人？其最近該署牛奶數箱被竊，並有二千五百萬元被人冒領，發售罐頭牛肉，牛奶，奶粉等救濟物資，委託中央信託局辦理，物品均以單位計，而每單位非要萬元以上，始能買到，這樣是否合乎救濟之道？故民衆嘖有煩言，對該署指責的新聞，亦有不少報章加以揭載，所以大家的目光都集中在那裹，看這救濟機關將如何淸算這筆救濟賬！</p>
<p>廿八日的下午，一間頗像課堂的會塲，門前紮着彩，對着門的正面，是一塊高出地面的換一尺的主席台，面對着主席台是一張一張桌子排成了縱橫七行，左右兩旁斜舖了好多椅子，這是記者與來賓的坐位，會塲的佈置異常簡單，除了從中央天窗放出了彩色的紙條，和主席台上的數盆鮮花，和新油漆的顯得柔和的乳黃色的牆壁，互相映輝外，僅有幾張標語在點綴着。最精彩的一幕，就在這裏展開了。</p>
<p>善救分署見死不救</p>
<p>下午三時正，便輪到善後救濟分署凌署長出席報吿，他挾着一疊報吿書，由二十八位顧問，專家，屬員，連同一位聯合國救濟善後總署的外國朋友阿當，魚貫而來，塡滿了記者席，及來賓席的空位，凌署長帶着一位秘書，走上主席台，在主席旁邊一個特設報吿的空位，他又將一張放大的統計表掛在台前，他恐怕參議員們看不淸楚書面的報吿。　主席的林議長翼中短短的說了幾句話後，就由凌署長報吿。凌署長知道社會上對他是不大滿意的，故來一個先發制人，他帶着客家話的國語，首先聲明該署的機構，又說各種救濟物資的購銷，是由總署財務廳派人組成一購銷處，與分署無關，尤其與渠本人「無關」，而且各方面都以爲善後分署領到大量物資，責難他們見死不救，但是聯合國運華的物資究有多少呢？總共値十萬萬美金，數量四百多萬噸，而撥給廣東的實在不多，在四個月當巾，實得的救濟麵粉僅三千五百噸，若分配給全省三千五百萬民衆，每人也不過僅得一磅而已，何况這其中一部份是直接散賑的，一部份是要拿來工賑的。第一批米雖已到九千包，是美國米，共分八種，按照聯合國的規定，三分之一散賑，三分之二平價發售，作爲平抑物價之用。但是由購銷處負責辦理，現在米價已漲到四萬多元一担，爲什麼不發放出來救濟呢？這是外國人的意思，因爲這些專家們耳朶很長，聞說四行搜購白米交日俘帶往東京，所以堅不發放，要等日俘走後才發放。</p>
<p>倉庫牛奶失竊七箱</p>
<p>至於報載倉庫失竊二十多箱牛奶等的情形，其實僅失掉牛奶七箱，若照市價計算，的値二十幾萬元，而全部罐頭値四十萬萬元，被盜二十幾萬元，也爲數很小，僅佔全數的百分之一，且原則已定，若査不出竊者，就要全倉的職工照價賠償。凌署長解釋過，又照着書面報吿而來一個報吿，費了一個多鐘頭，直到主席阻止了，還要求數分鐘的寬限，在報吿的時候，他像敎師似的，右手執着尺，左手拿着一本子，跑到台前，指着圖表解釋着。　參議員們耐心地聽完他的話後，再不能忍耐了，如炸彈似的展開了激烈的質詢，首由一參議員質問凌署長：「在購銷處未成立前，經售麵粉的經理，是否貴署長兼任？平價麵包代售商人黃植生舞弊案是否在凌署長任內」？</p>
<p>鉅額公款被人冒領</p>
<p>他又說：「聽說貴署有二千五百萬元公款被人冒領，有其事否？」接着參議員一個一個站起來再作機槍似的發問，感慨激昂的陳詞，忍耐不住，態度不免過火的質問，熱烈的掌聲，悲憤的情緒，在這會塲裏有三個半鐘頭。</p>
<p>大家都集中於：（一）賑濟物品貧民得不到實惠，落於非貧民的手裏。（二）平價麵粉麵包委商代售政策的失當。（三）該署管理不善，弊端重重，不應沾利益的人，荷囊却中飽了。（四）牛奶失竊，二千五百萬元被人員領眞象如何？由此可見管理不嚴密。（五）書面報吿數字錯誤百出，可見辦事玩忽。（六）黃植生舞弊案證據確鑿，何以久不嚴辦？（七）如果冬賬款報吿上已發放一月，但許多外縣仍未收到。（八）各縣救濟物資的分配，根據何標準等總計七十多件，質詢之後，凌署長均起立一一作答，不外是奉總署命令而委商代售，貪汚之事實請大家給我證據，一定嚴辦，牛奶僅失竊七箱，二千五百萬元是二月廿一日被人冒領，三月二日發覺，但這責任在中央銀行，因該支票上三個圖章均是僞造的。書面報吿數字錯誤，我當負責……</p>
<p>不要含混不要卸責</p>
<p>但是這樣答覆，不能使參議員們滿意，尤其當參議員提出發放麵粉黑幕重重的時候，凌署長就回答　說據來，一定嚴辦。這樣就激怒了一位參議員，他用着　亮的嗓子有力的說：「社會的言論，必有根據，不一定要舉出證據，假若一定要證據俱備的時候，才嚴辦，那麽社會的黑幕，將永遠無從改善。希望凌署長的答覆，不要含混也不要推卸責任」</p>
<p>時間已超出了二點鐘，電燈已齊明了，各參議員們因爲災民待救殷切，而救濟分署又辦理得不善，致引起了爭辯，遂不覺地讓時問延長下去。最後由一位參議員和靈地說：「今日所提出的問題，凌署長要明白我們都是善意的，今後我們所希望的：（一）因爲交通工具的困難，使米不能運來，但你們可否想辦法？（二）以後發放救濟物資，請公開。」就用這兩點希望作爲質詢的結論。</p>
<h3>破壞和平的槍聲　驚碎了南通人民的美夢</h3>
<p>— 南通三月廿八日通訊　姚葳寄</p>
<p>執行小組將蒞南通的消息傳來後，這小小的古城，二十餘萬市民，誰都像拉緊了心弦，期待着這握有給予他們和平，給予他們安居樂業的救主執行小組。是三月十八日從淸晨，每個人就開始盼待，一直到晚間六時，才眞正的知道了這救主的惠臨，雖然，天下着雨，銳利的寒風刮着，回是，成隊的學生，潮水似的羣衆，誰都以最緊張的心情，和行動來表示了他們歡迎的熱忱。</p>
<p>鄧克先生在羣衆的歡呼中出現了。是臨時架起的台，他答覆着人們的希望，他說：你們的問題，我們就要開始討論解決。</p>
<p>人們獲得了安慰，感謝執行小組，於是，高呼着：執行小組萬歲，人羣像潮水似的，湧着，推進着帶着歡呼帶着想像上的微欣走了。</p>
<p>埋首戶內工作</p>
<p>執行小組存在南通廿九萬老百姓的希望裘，他們究竟怎樣在生活着？自然最初的兩天，不能免的是些宴會，從酒席，到晚會，這些，是民衆們願意爲執行小組盡的微勞，因爲盼望的是執行小組在和平的氛圍裏能商討出永遠和平的決策，在幾次的宴會上，鄧克先生都說過：國共間的問題有許多地方是很可笑的，比如說雙方在爭執時，連雕堡的磚瓦問題，都會計算到的，可是，這些都是很小而可笑的事情。　因爲在南通的日子，大分都部遇着雨天，所以他們不能不埋在房間裏，我們的盟友鄧克先生和他的隨員白蘭士脫是比較寂寞的，因爲言語的隔閡，拜訪的人自然會减少些，但是鄧克先生並不厭倦這種生活，因爲他說他每天的工作時間，在北平時曾超渦了二十小時，現在是比較淸閒的，但是即使是晴天他也喜歡在室內，白蘭士脫的生活，只有和翻譯官在一起，才是他生動的時候。蕭上校每天翻閱一些上海來的報紙，處在組長的身份，他不大外出，對於談話的過程，在他的言行上，沒有絲毫的表現，他很文靜，吐着北平話，經常愛穿一雙布底的軟鞋，雖然他是個胖子，但是走起來是沒有聲音的，選有的政府方面的代表和隨員們的生活，他們的工作，都能很迅速的把握住一個時間辦完，其他的時候，都在他們活躍中波過去了。有時也找些戶內運動，比如打乓乒，還有羽毛球，也權充了室內遊戲。中共方面的韓組長，他不大笑，或許說，他隨去和他們共方代表在一起講起過去什麽精采的事表現得很興奮而外，我們是不易於見到他的笑容的！還有共方的代表和隨員們，大都他們都是集合在一起的時候多，玩撲克講過去談未來，但大部份的時間是看報閱書，再就是唱歌了，他們還有兩位新華社華中分社的特派員，其中有一個是女的，但是她也是在活躍裏顯得沉靜的，同時他們負有報道的職責，所以他們得抽空寫文章。</p>
<p>誰都感到神秘</p>
<p>這許多工作人員每天分佈在各個房間裏各執其事，集合在一起的時候只有進　的時間，起初早餐也得集體進，後來却民主化了，誰愛吃什麽，就分別的喚到他們的房間去，半晚兩餐在質的方面講，是隔日中餐，隔日西餐，以便適合中外人士的口胃。</p>
<p>在他們生活的形式上，是非常調洽的，不受任何拘束，爲講故事所發出的歡愉的笑聲是常常振盪在他們之開的。他們在一起也會隨便的說說民主解放，但却不爭執的批評什麽。執行小組是這樣進行着工作，誰都感到太神秘，是的，即便生活在一起的記者，也不能知道這種神秘將繼續到何時！</p>
<p>白蒲鎭有槍聲</p>
<p>正是和平的希望充滿在南通城二十餘萬同胞的心裏，和平的談判，正展開在執行小組裏的時候，距離南通縣城六十華里，國共爭持的據地——白蒲鎭，又來了破壞和平的槍聲。</p>
<p>是二十五日風雨交迫的黑夜，血肉的戰鬥展開了，自然，這是小部份的作戰，共方百餘人進攻，戰鬥的結果是共方傷十餘名，國軍傷一名，但是這破壞和平的槍聲，在黑夜裏却警醒了愛好和平的老百姓們的酣睡。　是和平了嗎？他們期待着執行小組的調處呢！</p>
<p>二十八日，一個個久雨後晴明的春日，鄧克先生和政府方面的代表蕭組長以次多人，曾携帶麵包水菓及手巾牙膏等應用物件，前往江北醫院慰問這一傷於內亂戰役的戰士。他們帶回的是無限的嘆息！「戰爭是慘酷的」！「和平就要來到了吧」？記者謹代南通及蘇北人民道麼默禱着！（三·廿八·南通）</p>
<p>國軍怖防瀋陽市</p>
<p>瀋陽市內十字路口堆積之防禦工事。靑年軍二〇七師士兵，持槍警戒。自國軍接防瀋陽市後，治安日趨良好，人心安定商店復業者日衆。</p>

<p>自由談　婦女與家庭特輯</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>救救失去母愛的孩子</h3>
<p>— 朱家慶</p>
<p>世界上每個孩子，都有他的母親，而”每個母親，都熱愛着她自己的孩子；但是却不一定每個孩子，都是得到母愛的恩澤的。所以我們說：「凡是得到母愛的孩子，才是幸福的呢！」</p>
<p>母愛不僅在家庭的組織上是個重要的原素；就是在個人生活的過程上，也是件寳貴的東西。當然的，他在人類與世界和平的前面，也將貢獻了一個穩固的基石；因爲人類的同情與互愛，就是人類母愛底昇華。</p>
<p>母愛在個人生活的過程上所發生的一種影響，這種影響，實際上就是一種敎育的力量。因爲敎育的本質是在行爲的改變，經騐的改造；用吾師董任堅先生的一個術語稱爲「化」。母親在本能上是愛護子女的；而且她是每個人所最親近的人—簡直是人生第一位敎師，所以她「化」的能力是最强；她影響於個人的人格發展是最大；她與敎育的關係也最密切。</p>
<p>母親在敎育上的關係，旣是這樣的密切；况且情緒與敎育，在現代敎育思潮上，又認爲是不可分離。據一般心理分析論者的研究：以爲母親的情緒與態度，足以影響兒童整個人格發展的型式。換句話說：一個得到母愛的人，他的人格將是愉快的，自信的，積極的；而一個沒有得到母愛的人，他的人格將是沉鬰的，卑怯的，消極的。他的生活將是不健全的；他的行爲將是不正常的；他將不能與人們營愉快的共同生活。因爲他沒有得到母愛的感應，所以他根本就不會了解愛是什麽；更無從以他的愛去愛家庭，愛社會，愛國家，愛世界與人類了！</p>
<p>我們知道在這世界上，雖然有許多的孩子，他們是很幸福的；因爲他們得到了偉大的母愛。但是同樣有許多的孩子，他們是陷於悲痛的深淵中；因爲他們已失去了自己的母親，失去了這偉大的母愛。我們對於這一羣不幸的孩子，要站在家庭幸福，社會合作，國家繁榮，與世界和平及人類進步的立塲上，請求大家—尤其是一般娶着繼室的父親們，要救救這羣失去了母愛的孩子們！</p>
<h3>養女歌</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>『喜鵲鵲，哇喳喳，這個了頭莫養她；養大了時賠錢貨，與田賣地要賠她；要個襖兒南京緞，要條裙子北京紗，全部嫁粧要齊備，要雙鞋子滿帮花。』</p>
<p>這是一首舊式家庭中養育女兒的歌謠。在這首歌謠裏，可以看到中國過去的一般舊式家庭，是如何地抱着「重男輕女」的觀念！</p>
<p>在男女平等的今日，這種不合理的重男輕女的觀念，是有加以剷除的必要的。</p>
<p>可是在目前社會情况之下，我相信還有不少的舊式家庭，存着這種不合理的觀念，這似乎也是硏究婦女家庭問題者，値得硏討的一個問題。</p>
<h3>離婚理由</h3>
<p>— 自强</p>
<p>舊金山有一個五十歲老人艾斯可。白朗，近來向法院提出與其妻離婚，他的理由是：他的妻子上床睡時要帶着二十七頭貓。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>婦女展開社會工作的心理障礙（下）</h3>
<p>— 蕭寀</p>
<p>我國自古來即有重男輕女的觀念，如詩經所載：「乃生男子，載寢之牀，載衣之裳，載弄之璋，其泣喤喤，朱芾斯皇，室家君王；乃生女子，載寢之地，載衣之裼，載弄之瓦，無非無儀，唯酒食是議，無父母詒罹。」由此可見男女自幼起即被分作兩種待遇。這種觀念自古直到現在，幾千年來，除少數知識分子，已接受過新思潮的洗禮，已經稍稍改變以外，這種重男輕女的風氣非常濃厚地保存在中國社會各階層間。由這種觀念所演化出來的文化制度，就是「三從四德」和「女子無才便是德」之類的謬誤見解，加於女子身上的桎梏。這種傳統觀念，所加於女子的，不僅是精神上的痛苦和壓迫，更使女子心理上產生一種不如人的自卑感覺，以爲自己眞是卑劣無能，不能够和男子平等的。這種數千年來舊禮敎遺毒的影響，乃造成婦女心理上的自卑意識，於是不敢也自以爲不能在社會上和男子競爭。這種自卑感覺便是阻碍婦女展開社會事業的心理原因之一。</p>
<p>中國婦女旣是長期屈服於男性勢力的壓迫和束縛之下，日常生活的天地，就是囿於極狹小的家庭範圍之內，謂「女子十年不出」，「深宮固門，閽寺守之，男不入，女不出」，在這樣的情形之下，女子和異性接近的機會都很少，可見與外界接觸的機會更是非常地少了，裏足穿耳的風氣，就是禁止女子與外界接觸的表示。女子日常生活旣僅限於家庭，因此對於社會生活的興趣便自然缺乏。現代的婦女雖然可以不受這種束縛，然而我國家庭敎育之對於女孩管束較男孩爲嚴厲，則仍舊是普遍的現象。一般父母仍禁止女孩像男孩一樣自由參與各種社會活動。這種家庭敎育，便足以養成婦女活動拘囿於家庭範圍之內的習慣，缺乏社會活動的廣大的興趣，於是觀念狹淺，眼光短小，只看到個人活動的小天地，這種歷來家庭敎育之影響，養成狹窄的興趣和觀念，是足以阻碍婦女有廣大的社會活動的興趣，以致不能展開社會工作的心理原因之二。</p>
<p>通常一般情形，婦女對於家庭和社會除了生育小孩處理家政之外，是不負什麼責任的，這不但已形成一種傳統的社會習慣，而且在婦女方面，也已養成了倚賴男子的觀念和態度。她們認爲將自己和家庭的經濟責任完全委之於男子肩上，是應該的，就是婦女在家庭裏負有生產的義務，也是站在帮助男子的地位，是附屬的而非主要的，因此便養成婦女一種倚賴心理。經過相常的長時間之後，這種心理，便形成爲一種習慣，安於過着倚賴生活而不自覺，自己不費力而過着不負責任的生活，結果因惰性的緣故，而不願再有什麼打開天地克服困難的企圖，更缺乏此種勇氣。人的精神活動總是走最短的路徑，這是心理學家吿訴我們的，因此便養成一種就易避難的態度與習性，而不向社會奮鬥了。這就是由於惰性和倚賴心理而使婦女不能展開社會工作的心理原因之三。</p>
<p>其餘足以阻碍婦女展開社會工作的心理原因，如母性重於事業心，和缺乏遠大理想，富於虛榮心，躭於目前的物質享受等都是。心理學家有分女子心理爲慈母型者，就是母性特別發達，全部精神活動都以撫育子女爲重要，這種婦女當然傾向於家庭主婦—類的，對於家事非常有興趣，而對於社會事業就淡漠忽視了。至於缺乏遠大理想和躭於物質享受的婦女，只注重目前現實的生活，而對於較目前現實更遠一點的東西便看不見想不到了，當然比較不着實際的社會事業，是不能引起她們的興趣的。</p>
<p>婦女要求眞正的解放，要求眞正的男女平等，只有參加廣大的社會工作，以社會工作作爲個人的終生事業，去努力做一個愛迪生，牛頓，或莎士比亞吧。只有這樣，才能够從男性中心社會的勢力之下解放出來。</p>

<p>春天來了，小女孩有時喜歡換換花樣，不愛老穿工褲，想穿穿小裙子了。因爲在學校跳舞及做遊戲時，來得有姿勢，而且比工褲方便，尤其是穿來顯短的小西裝，做一條深色的小裙子一罩，時時更換上衣，就好像老在穿新衣一樣。製法很簡單，可利用大人的裙子或旗袍橫過來改做即成。圖中尺寸適合五六歲小女孩穿的。</p>
<p>材料：任何深素色或方格呢絨料均可，如果素色的可繡上幾朶花。背帶及胸圍可襯以醒目的緞料。</p>
<p>製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁。先縫好裙身，前後各打兩摺，距離要分配得好。安上胸國，左面留出五寸左右開口，穿脫可方便些。然後安背帶，後身可將帶連合縫起，安置時令小孩試樣。裙帶長短可斟酌配上。胸圍及背帶內的襯緞，可稍露出一點邊緣（如鑲滾樣），可更增加裙子的美觀。</p>

<h3>Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Others Arrive in Beiping, Immediately Fly to Shenyang to Investigate the Truth; Solution to be Negotiated Upon Return</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The Chongqing Military Trio of Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Chen Shiqu, who conveyed Zhou Enlai's opinions, along with five other members, a total of eight people, arrived in Beiping at 2:30 PM today on a US military aircraft. Those welcoming them at the Xiyuan Airport included Mayor Xiong Bin, Chief of Staff of the Xingying (Military Headquarters) Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Chief of Staff Office Song Kentang, Executive Department Members Zheng Jiemin and Rao Bosen, Deputy Commander of the Beiping Garrison Hu Bohan, and over a hundred journalists. After disembarking, Gilun, Qin Dechun, and Chen Shiqu proceeded by car to the Xiehe Auditorium to listen to the Executive Department's work report. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM, and the three parties held separate meetings: the government side at the Executive Yuan's Beiping Office, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at Ye Jianying's residence, and the US side within the Executive Department at Xiehe Hospital. In the evening, the three Executive Department members hosted a banquet for the trio at Cuihualou Restaurant. The trio will fly to Shenyang on the 11th, at which time Ye Jianying may go in place of Zhou Enlai due to illness. Chen Shiqu's visit was to convey Zhou Enlai's opinions to Ye Jianying and not to participate in the trio. Qin Dechun stated that Minister Chen was suffering from stomach illness, so he was temporarily substituting for him. The trio's trip to Shenyang is to gather materials, understand the truth of the Northeast situation, and then negotiate a detailed solution to the Northeast problem upon their return. Therefore, they did not bring a specific plan for the Executive Department to follow. They will stay in Shenyang for a few days and do not plan to inspect other places, returning to Beiping and then to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Qin Dechun, the mayor who presided over Beiping's municipal affairs before the July 7th Incident, revisited Beiping on the 10th as a member of the Military Trio. Reflecting on the past, Qin expressed to reporters that he felt extremely pleased because justice had triumphed over power. He spoke very cautiously about the Northeast mediation issue, saying that the situation in the Northeast was not yet clear and that Chongqing had not made any decisions on this matter. He would go to Shenyang to see and then talk, hoping that the problem could be resolved rationally.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] CCP representative Chen Shiqu, a major general who came to Beiping to convey Zhou Enlai's opinions, told reporters after the CCP meeting at Ye Jianying's residence today: (1) An agreement was reached last month to first stop the conflict and then resolve the Northeast issue through negotiation. No more concrete solution to the Northeast issue has emerged since then. Chen explained that the troop movements of both armies in the Northeast should be stopped immediately, and other handover issues should be discussed after the conflict ceases. When asked by reporters about General Zhu De's previous statement that he did not oppose the National Army taking over the Northeast, and what the CCP's attitude would be towards the National Army taking over the Northeast in the future, Chen replied: I do not remember the CCP making such a statement. (2) Regarding the troop reduction issue, Chen said: The list of CCP troops to be retained after the troop reduction, which the CCP should submit, is currently being discussed at a meeting in Yan'an. The CCP army has already begun demobilization. As of April 15th, the 900,000 field army can be reduced by one-third.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Marshall will return to China soon, so Zhou Enlai is staying in Chongqing to meet with Marshall and will not come to Beiping. According to CCP Major General Chen Shiqu, another important reason for Zhou's absence from Beiping is that the plane that flew to Yan'an on the 8th crashed near Xi'an. Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, and Deng Fa, the CCP representative returning from the labor conference in Europe, were all killed. Zhou needs to handle these matters in Chongqing. Moreover, the CCP currently has only Zhou and Lu Dingyi as representatives in Chongqing, and he can hardly leave. Chongqing still has many matters that Zhou needs to discuss with various parties.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] There is a new development in the internal situation of China today. The Military Trio flew to Beiping by special plane at 9:00 AM today and then transferred to Pan (?), to personally investigate the Northeast conflict. The 28th Executive Subgroup in Shenyang traveled to Sipingjie by car yesterday. In Chongqing, the Democratic League acted as mediator, inviting leaders from both the Nationalists and Communists to a meeting today to discuss a thorough solution to the Northeast ceasefire.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Harbin; Communist Army Occupies Jiutai County's Xinglong Mountain; Beining Train Derails at Wanjiatun Station Bridge</h3>

One locomotive and four passenger cars were involved, two of which were burned. The details are still unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Communist Army is now launching a large-scale attack on the Beining Railway within Liaoning Province. It is reported that the Communist Army attacking the railway belongs to the Jireliao Military Region and sneaked into the Northeast from the Xifengkou area.

<h3>Soviet Army Rearguard Unit to Leave Changchun on the 14th; Our Military Delegation Arrives in Harbin</h3>

At Dehui Station, Wu Wenfu, a member of the delegation, photographed a Communist Army guard wearing a red and white armband. The guard stood at attention, allowing the photo to be taken. After the photo was taken, they smiled at each other but did not speak.</p>
<h3>Although the Trio Reached an Agreement, No Progress in Shandong; Chen Yi Invited to Jinan for Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 10th] After the Jinan Executive Subgroup exchanged views with the military and political authorities here on the 6th and reached an agreement, there is hope for clarifying the situation in Shandong. However, as of now, there has been no concrete action to thoroughly implement the various provisions of Annex 6 of the Peace Agreement, and the repair work on the railways in Shandong is still stalled. Therefore, general observers are not entirely optimistic. The Executive Subgroup is facing a difficult situation given the development of this dull situation and has telegraphed Commander Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army, inviting him to fly to Jinan to discuss everything in person, hoping to resolve the Shandong issue as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of the people.</p>

The local police are investigating whether the case was a case of insider theft.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang is in Guiyang; Personally Inspects the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters Yesterday; Delivers an Inspiring Speech at Guizhou University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guiyang Dispatch, 10th] Chairman Chiang arrived in Guiyang on the 9th and spent a peaceful night. At 9:30 AM on the 10th, he first drove to inspect the Guizhou Provincial Government. Chairman Yang Sen personally led all the department heads and about 200 staff members of the provincial government to welcome him in front of the provincial government. The Chairman's car arrived at the provincial government amidst the welcoming music. The welcoming personnel stood at attention and paid their respects, and the Chairman nodded in response. Yang immediately led the department heads to accompany him, and after a brief rest in the reception room, he inquired briefly about the civil administration and transportation situation in Guizhou Province. He then inspected the various offices of the provincial government and the Guizhou Provincial Security Command adjacent to the provincial government. He then drove to inspect the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters and then drove to the scenic area of Huaxi, 18 kilometers from Guiyang, for sightseeing. Yang accompanied him. He arrived at 10:40 AM and stayed there for four hours. He visited the orphans of the late Division Commander Dai Anlan to express his condolences and went to the National Guizhou University, where he gave a cordial and inspiring speech to the faculty and students in the school auditorium, revealing that Guizhou is an important town in the southwest, and that the construction of Guizhou requires talent, and that efforts should be made to enrich the school so that it becomes a modern institution of learning. After the speech, all the faculty and students cheered and applauded for three minutes. The Chairman then happily left the school and returned to his residence to rest. He returned to Guiyang at 2:30 PM. The special car inspected the Guizhou branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League in the city and then returned to the Qianlingshan residence at 3:30 PM. After dinner, he took a sedan chair to visit Qianlingshan, appearing very happy.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang visited Guizhou University at about 1:00 PM this afternoon and summoned President Zhang and the deans and training directors of each college to inquire about school affairs. He was extremely concerned about the living conditions of all the faculty and students. He then gave a brief speech to more than 1,000 faculty and students, saying: "When I came to your school on the 7th, I was very pleased to see that the students were energetic and healthy. Thinking back to eleven years ago, when I first came to Guizhou, most of the people of Guizhou were addicted to opium, which caused them to be pale and thin, and weak. Today, the general youth are healthy and lively, and the situation feels like another world. From this, it can be seen that our Guizhou compatriots have made rapid progress. This is what I am most comforted by. Now, Guizhou's economic position is not as good as Sichuan and Yunnan, but Guizhou is located in the center of the southwestern provinces, with an important location and abundant mineral resources. If we can work hard to develop and intensify construction, it will surely become an important town in the southwest and an important base for national rejuvenation. When I came to Guizhou in the 24th year (of the Republic, 1935), I had four major wishes for Guizhou, namely (1) eradicating opium, (2) developing mineral resources, (3) developing transportation, and (4) improving culture. Now, except for the first item, which has been largely completed, the other three items are either in progress or have not yet started. Your school is a school of Guizhou and often cultivates talents for Guizhou as cadres for building a new Guizhou. I will find ways to enrich the school's facilities and make it a modern school. At the same time, I also hope that all the faculty and students of the school will work hard, endure hardship, settle down to teach, and cultivate a spirit of perseverance and acquire modern scientific knowledge, and then fulfill my wishes and build a new Guizhou based on the Three Principles of the People."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Remarks to Foreign Reporters Before Leaving Chongqing</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] (Delayed) Chairman Chiang said when he received United Press reporters today: If the United States continues to undertake its task of leading the world, the United Nations organization can succeed. China stands behind the United Nations organization with an upright attitude, but currently the leaders of the Chinese government do not believe that peace can be maintained solely by relying on the United Nations organization without the active support of the democratic countries. All countries in the world must always be vigilant to maintain the democratic system. The Chairman believes that a united government in the Nationalists-Communists talks can be achieved in the short term. He also clarified that the Communist Party and other parties should dedicate themselves to the welfare of China as a whole and should not make attempts at "internal sabotage." The Chairman looked radiant and very healthy when he received the United Press reporters. Regarding the issue of Sino-Soviet relations, the Chairman said: Last August, China concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with friendly sincerity, and hopes to abide by the provisions of the treaty. Regarding the domestic situation, he is not pessimistic about the future due to inflation, economic disorder, and a certain degree of social unrest. He continued to say that transportation has been restored and that supplies from abroad are also coming in, and that the situation should improve in a few months. The economic recovery of China depends almost entirely on the speed with which the urgently needed materials supplied by the United States are shipped. If a new government can be formed and the domestic situation allows, he hopes to visit the United States, at which time he will stay in the United States for at least one month. The interview lasted for more than an hour.</p>
<h3>Wu Guozhen and Liu Kai Answer Foreign Reporters; Sino-US Trade Agreement to be Signed Soon; Puyi to be Handed Over in Shenyang or Changchun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM this afternoon, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows: Question: What is the current situation of the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Vietnam? Answer: According to the troop figures on March 1, half of the Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam have already withdrawn, and the rest are also in the process of withdrawing. Question: Did the former Emperor Bao Dai of Annam come to Chongqing to have political talks with the Chinese government? Answer: Bao Dai's visit to Chongqing was purely a private visit and had nothing to do with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He paid his respects to Chairman Chiang the week before. Question: How is the negotiation of the Sino-US trade agreement progressing? Answer: Most of the Sino-US trade agreement negotiations have been agreed upon, and the official signing date is not far away. Question: What is the current situation of the conflict in the Northeast? Answer: Regarding the Northeast issue, the relevant documents should be based on three items: (1) the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which stipulates that the sovereignty of the Northeast should be taken over by the government; the remaining two documents are (2) the order to cease military conflict and restore traffic jointly promulgated on January 10, which stipulates that the National Army will enter the Northeast or move within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore Chinese sovereignty, and is not subject to any restrictions; and (3) the agreement reached by the three-person meeting on March 8 on sending an executive subgroup to the Northeast. As long as the CCP follows the provisions of the above three documents, does not obstruct the National Army from taking over the areas evacuated by the Soviet Army, and does not attack the areas already entered by the National Army, there is no possibility of conflict in the Northeast. Question: What is the situation of Puyi's extradition? Answer: The Soviet ambassador previously informed our government that the Soviet side was prepared to hand over Puyi to the Chinese government, and the two sides are currently discussing the handover in Shenyang, but it may also be held in Changchun.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Return to China This Weekend; Continues Efforts to Promote Nationalist-Communist Cooperation; New York Rumors Marshall to be Appointed Secretary of State</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 9th] The achievements of President Truman's special envoy Marshall in promoting peace in China are on the verge of disintegration during his return to the country to report on his work. The dispute between the Nationalists and Communists has arisen again. The Communist Party accuses the Kuomintang of failing to implement the agreements established by the Political Consultative Conference, and the government also accuses the Communist Army of preventing the National Army from taking over the Northeast. Special Envoy Marshall, in view of this unfavorable development, is now planning to return to his post early. Once Special Envoy Marshall returns to his post in China, what will be presented to the world will at least be an apparent cessation of hostilities between the Nationalists and Communists. The fact that the quarrels between the Nationalists and Communists became active again during Marshall's absence from office shows that the various reforms promoted in China are not yet profound. After returning to the country, Marshall made it clear in public and private conversations that he believed that China's peace depended half on the world's approval and half on its own revival and development. Marshall seems to be planning to carry this through to the end until full success is achieved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 9th] Marshall again solemnly declared his previous testimony when attending the Pearl Harbor incident hearing on the morning of the 9th, that President Roosevelt did not call him on the night of December 6, 1941, and that he did not attend the White House staff meeting that night. He also denied hearing that President Roosevelt planned to issue a warning to Japan on December 9 if the US edict to the Japanese Emperor was ignored. The hearing was adjourned until the morning of the 11th. Marshall may appear in court again before going to China this weekend.</p>
<p>[United Press New York Dispatch, 9th] The International Statistical Bureau predicted today that US Special Envoy to China General Marshall will soon succeed Byrnes as Secretary of State. The forecast also said that the future changes in the US State Department will affect Japan, and that a tougher policy than MacArthur's will be adopted. In addition, after the US military withdraws from China, the United States will increase economic and technical assistance to the Chinese National Government, and China, with the support of the United States, will refuse to recognize the Soviet Union's purchase of equipment previously owned or controlled by Japan in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>The Aviation Committee is Searching for the Plane Wang Ruofei and Others Were On; The Government Has Telegraphed Shaanxi and Sichuan Provinces for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Chongqing News: Two to three US aircraft circled over the Qinling Mountains near Xi'an and the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi this morning, searching for the US transport plane that went missing on the 8th. The government has urgently telegraphed the governments of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, ordering border counties to assist in the search. It is reported that the plane was carrying Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian (i.e., Qin Bogu), Ye Ting, and other fourteen people, as well as important documents carried by Wang and his party. It is reported that a US plane has discovered traces of airplane wreckage similar to the one near the foothills of Zhongtiaoshan, and the search area has been expanded to Shanxi Province on the other side of the Yellow River. According to people in the aviation industry, the relevant parties in Chongqing may obtain the truth about the plane's accident and the location of the crash in the next day or two, but if it was not a forced landing and the accident occurred in the mountainous areas near the Qinling Mountains, the prognosis is not good.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 10th] The US plane carrying CCP representatives Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, and Ye Ting to Yan'an took off from Chongqing on the morning of the 8th. After passing Xi'an at noon, it lost contact with the ground and there has been no news so far. All parties are extremely concerned about this. General Zhou Zhirou, director of the Aviation Committee, specially dispatched two reconnaissance planes at 1:00 PM this afternoon to search along the way. However, due to the bad weather, the ground was blurred and unclear when viewed from the air, so the two planes returned midway. According to Director Zhou, he will continue to dispatch planes to search on the 11th.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives from Various Provinces to Depart for Nanjing Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The National Assembly will not be postponed.

<h3>Japanese Technicians and Korean Residents Ordered to Be Sent Away by a Deadline</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 10th] He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, suddenly issued two orders: one ordering the repatriation of Japanese technicians retained for use in China's industry, and the other ordering all Korean residents to immediately leave China and return to their country, causing the authorities in the Eleventh War Zone and those in charge of repatriation to work day and night without a moment to spare. This order reverses the policy of retaining technicians and sets an urgent deadline for Korean residents, which is particularly unexpected. There are no fewer than 50,000 to 60,000 Korean residents in North China, all of whom are required to go to Tianjin to board ships before April 15. The 1,700 people concentrated in the Beiping area have already taken the train to Tianjin this morning, but the others are not yet prepared to immediately comply with the order. The Korean Residents' Association and the Korean Comfort Mission representing the Provisional Government of Seoul have protested, saying that the deadline is so urgent that the residents will not have enough time to take care of their personal affairs and dispose of their property. There are already 15,000 to 25,000 Koreans in the Beiping area alone. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have recently been competing to hire technicians for railways and industry. It is estimated that there are no fewer than 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese technicians willing to stay in North China for employment by military agencies. There are currently 50,000 Japanese prisoners and residents in Tianjin waiting to be repatriated.</p>

<h3>UN Security Council Decides to Temporarily Shelve the Iran and Spain Issues – Iran Firmly Requests to Keep It on the Agenda – Meeting Declares Indefinite Recess</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 9th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, both the Iran and Spain issues were raised, but both were shelved indefinitely. Soviet representative Gromyko returned to his seat and requested the withdrawal of the Iran case. The Council immediately declared an indefinite recess.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service New York, 9th] Iranian Ambassador Ala wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Lie today, stating in brief: I am instructed to state that the position of the Iranian government is no different from that announced at the Security Council on April 4, 1946. Our government hopes that the issue raised by Iran to the Security Council will continue to be included in the agenda in accordance with the resolution of that meeting on April 4, 1946.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 10th] Officials from various delegations to the United Nations predicted today that the Soviet Union's proposal to the Security Council to withdraw the Iran case would inevitably fail. However, the matter seems to be subject to fierce debate, and both the United States and Britain oppose the Soviet proposal. Iran's formal declaration in a letter to the Council opposing the Soviet proposal has strengthened the positions of the United States and Britain. The members of the Council have scheduled a secret meeting today to discuss the location of the United Nations headquarters. Several representatives privately expressed their dissatisfaction with the current location at Hunter College, and the headquarters may be moved from New York to San Francisco or Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 9th] Soviet representative Gromyko, who previously refused to attend the Security Council meetings discussing the Iran issue to show his opposition, today returned to the meeting with US representative Stettinius and rejoined the meeting. However, Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala was no longer seen in the audience. Today, the Council devoted itself to discussing the issue of changing its rules of procedure, which was the 31st meeting of the Council, starting at 8:06 pm. All national representatives attended, except for Mexican Foreign Minister Najera, who was undergoing a physical examination at a hospital in Baltimore. The chairman of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee reported on the committee's work and proposed 23 rules of procedure, supplementing the 15 rules of procedure adopted at the London conference in January. The Council first submitted the first to fifth articles for discussion, including a provision that the Council should hold regular meetings at least once every two weeks. In addition, regular meetings were held, attended by foreign ministers, heads of government, or their representatives. Stettinius said: The United States fully agrees to hold these regular meetings twice a year. Later, based on Gromyko's motion, the Council decided to convene at least 11 presidents, prime ministers, or foreign ministers of member states twice a year to hold meetings. The article in the rules of procedure stipulating that the Council should hold regular meetings at least once every two weeks was also approved by the Council.</p>

<h3>General Election Held Throughout Japan Yesterday – Women Voted Enthusiastically – Democratic Politics Undergoing First Test – Orderly Under Allied Supervision</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Tokyo, 10th] This morning, Tokyo newspapers gave great importance to Japan's general election. Early in the morning, American military police drove various vehicles on the streets, each equipped with two loudspeakers, with Japanese personnel shouting, "People, don't forget to vote for your own candidates." Forty Allied journalists, along with General Whitney, Director of the Government Section of MacArthur Headquarters, went to various polling stations. Most of the polling stations were located in national schools. Japan's general election was presided over by the American occupation forces, so there was one American soldier at each polling station to maintain order.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Japan held a general election today, which ended at 6:00 pm. The most orderly election in Japanese history has been completed. Based on the number of votes that have not yet been counted, it is estimated that 65% to 70% of the electors in Tokyo City voted. The percentage of votes in several important rural areas is slightly higher than in Tokyo. If the final count is consistent with the above figures, then the number of votes in this general election will be greatly reduced compared to the forced vote in the 1942 general election, and only slightly better than the semi-restricted vote in the 1937 general election. This morning, the polling stations in Tokyo were crowded with people. Some Japanese political observers who originally expected that 75% of the voters would vote have changed their views, thinking that it would exceed this number, but there were fewer voters in the afternoon. More women voted than expected. In Tokyo City, it has exceeded 50%, while it was originally expected to be just over 25%. At the same time, the exact results of the general election will not be known until tomorrow. The ballot counting will begin at 8:00 am tomorrow, and some results will be known that night. There are still many men and women who applied for blank ballots, but they cannot vote due to recent population migration and incomplete registration. Based on this situation, the Japanese Communist Party has marched several times, demanding a new election, and may be more determined to re-raise this demand in the future. As of 3:00 pm, about 50.5% of male and female electors in Tokyo have voted, and the voting percentage in the areas near Tokyo is roughly the same, but so far, the voting statistics in Japan are incomplete. There were no accidents during the voting in Tokyo today. Bower, the British member of the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan, went to inspect the four important districts of Tokyo this afternoon and talked with the officials in charge of the election work, and saw that the voting situation was very peaceful and orderly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 10th] It is the first time in history that Japanese women have participated in the election. Before the election, it was predicted that the number of people who would abstain from voting would be between 60% and 70%, but based on the situation of women voting this morning, the number of women who abstained from voting will be roughly between 30% and 40%, which is beyond the general expectation. According to Kyodo News, as of 2:00 pm today, 65% to 70% of the 36 million voters in Japan have voted.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 10th] Japan held its first general election in ten years today. Residents of Tokyo went to the polling stations to vote under the dark sky. There were many women and girls in the voting crowd. Most of the polling stations are located in schools, and the ballot boxes are placed on white wooden tables, with Japanese officials and American inspectors supervising the voting. A reporter from this agency asked an elderly worker why he voted in favor of the Socialist Party. The old man replied, "I really don't know." Another 52-year-old unemployed person also voted in favor of the Socialist Party. It is said that "I used to vote for Asanuma, and I don't want to change now." Most residents of Tokyo apparently voted in favor of the Socialist Party, but this situation is true in large cities. Farmers in all parts of the country follow the traditional practice and support the successors of the old Minseito and Seiyukai, namely the current Progressive Party and Liberal Party. As of 2:00 pm today, voters have accounted for 75% of the total number. After the new parliament is elected, a special meeting will be held on May 10 to discuss the new constitution and budget bill.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Government Restores Customs Affairs Today</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Extinguish the Tinder of the Northeast!</h3>
<p>Despite the National Government's efforts to strive for domestic peace for more than seven months, and despite the people's day and night prayers for sincere unity among all parties to achieve domestic peace and unification, it ultimately seems impossible to stop the Chinese Communist Party, which is prone to creating chaos, from launching its long-plotted disturbances. Despite the fact that we, both the government and the public, believe that the Northeast issue is a diplomatic issue, and we have exercised forbearance and restraint, compromising to achieve the guarantee that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from the nine provinces of the Northeast by the end of this month through diplomatic efforts, we ultimately cannot influence the Chinese Communist Party to refrain from taking advantage of the difficult diplomatic environment to hinder the National Government's reception of sovereignty over the Northeast. Under such circumstances, the situation in the Northeast has become even more tense with the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Chinese and foreign personages alike already believe that the overall situation in the Northeast in the next ten days may affect the safety of the overall situation in China; and according to yesterday's news, we sincerely fear that if the tinder of the Northeast's disturbances is not quickly extinguished with a quick and decisive approach, the disaster of a prairie fire will be imminent!</p>
<p>From the Chongqing telegrams, we briefly read the absurd arguments of the CCP's Liberation Daily and New China Daily, which actually slander Mr. Chiang, the head of state and leader of the War of Resistance, as "colluding with the enemy, selling the country, and compromising to surrender." No ordinary person would believe their propaganda. However, why are they making such "excessive propaganda," as the Ta Kung Pao says? Their purpose is nothing more than to create a reason for their impending rebellion. Therefore, the Chongqing World Daily criticizes that "the CCP is no longer a domestic political party organized by Chinese people, but a group of rioters who are entirely carrying out the duties of a fifth column for foreign countries," which is truly a pointed and insightful argument. We believe that this absurd argument is a signal that the CCP intends to play with fire in the Northeast and even throughout the country. We must not allow them to play with fire again, and we must quickly extinguish the tinder of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Looking again at the remarks made by Wu Xiuquan, the chief of staff of Lin Biao, the leader of the communist army in the Northeast, to a United Press reporter in Shenyang on the 8th, he actually advocated that the areas of the Northeast from which Soviet troops withdraw should be jointly taken over by the armies of the KMT and the CCP. He even dared to say that although the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the Central Government's army should take over from the Soviet army, this is a matter between the Soviet Union and the Central Government, and in some areas of the Northeast, the local people have already formed a communist army. Therefore, regarding the issue of takeover, the local communist party has organized a "People's Government" and has already taken over in the name of the people, and there is no need for the national army to enter. Wu's intention in his remarks is obvious: to use the guise of the "People's Government" to obstruct the national army's takeover. What is this if not deliberately trying to secede the Northeast and split the country? What other purpose is there in creating a pretext to raise the banner of treason in the Northeast? As far as the CCP is concerned today, they are full of confidence that they have planted explosives in the Northeast, waiting only for the fuse to explode.</p>
<p>We, the common people, have long been impatient with this situation after the victory. For example, with a sick person, it is best not to have surgery, but if the illness is dangerous and surgery is unavoidable, only surgery offers hope of recovery. We really don't understand why the government is delaying it so long! According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the takeover of the Northeast was originally the National Government's responsibility. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty concerned the Soviet Government for the Soviet Union and the National Government for China. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast should have been followed by the national army taking over the defense, which was an unquestionable matter. Before the power of the National Government had reached the Northeast, any organization or army in the area, if not recognized by the National Government, was an illegal organization and an illegal army. From a strictly righteous standpoint, the national army should have quickly eliminated such illegal organizations and illegal armies. In fact, if these organizations and armies without legal basis still appear in the Northeast, this is precisely enough to show the government's magnanimity and forbearance for the sake of the country. However, the common people only know that the National Government is the sole legal government of China, representing all the people of China, and no matter what nice words the local "People's Government" borrows, it cannot represent all the people of China. The Northeast is a part of our country's territory, the Northeast of the Chinese people, not the Northeast of the people of the Northeast, let alone the Northeast of some who borrow names. The National Government represents all the people of China to go to take over, which is just and righteous, and any resistance should be overcome.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has always had a consistent style, which is to insist that the national army's purpose is not to resist foreign enemies but to suppress domestic opposition. Wu's claim that the national army's purpose in entering the Northeast is to eliminate the communist army's forces does not need to be refuted by us. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, the CCP has repeatedly attempted to transform it into a domestic political issue. In the past few months, CCP troops have entered the Northeast from Rehe and the Shandong Peninsula, with the aim of establishing a base for treason and creating a fait accompli in order to prevent the national army from taking over. We are indeed regretful that the Northeast, under the occupation of friendly Soviet troops, has allowed this situation to arise; the CCP's obstruction of the national army's takeover under such circumstances is particularly sinister in its intention. This is clearly a poisonous scheme to sell out national interests in order to expand its own territorial power! After China's long war of resistance, the traitors who sold out national interests have all been imprisoned and will soon be brought to justice under the law. Yet at this moment, there are still people who disregard national interests and attempt to undermine the National Government's takeover of the Northeast, and attempt to undermine the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty. In their hearts, how are they any different from the traitors of the past?</p>
<p>At this moment, we must solemnly inform our allies: the CCP's consistent style is to undermine China's unification and expand its own power, leading China in a direction that the Chinese people do not want to go. Its purpose is incompatible with the interests of the Chinese people and the interests of our allies. We cannot let it continue to act so recklessly! The peace of the world depends on the Far East, and the peace of the Far East depends on a strong China under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. Supporting the development of the CCP in China is contrary to the interests of the Chinese people, the peace of the world, and the interests of our allies. Marshal Marshall will soon return to China, and we hope that this situation in which the CCP deliberately plays with fire in the Northeast can be fundamentally changed. We especially hope that the tinder of the Northeast can be quickly extinguished in the near future.</p>
<h3>Countries with Mandate Authority Should Be Subject to UN Supervision. Our Representative Proposed at the League of Nations General Assembly. The British Representative Expressed Opposition Outside the Meeting</h3>

The indictment stated that Lenting's behavior was not unintentional and believed that the information Lenting attempted to obtain would be detrimental to the United States, while another country, the Soviet Union, would benefit.</p>

<h3>The City Provisional Council Concluded Successfully Yesterday; Closing Ceremony Held Yesterday; Listening to Replies from Central Government Agencies to Various Inquiries; Mayor Qian Hosted a Banquet for All Councilors in the Evening, and They Dispersed in High Spirits</h3>
<p>The City Provisional Council held its thirteenth general meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Speaker Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. The Secretariat reported on three items: (1) Twenty-six councilors were present, meeting the legal quorum; (2) The reports and review opinions from the Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus have been sent to the Secretariat; (3) The minutes of the twelfth general meeting were read, followed by discussion of proposals. Draft resolutions on the work reports of various bureaus were passed.</p>
<p>Central Government Agencies Respond to Inquiries</p>
<p>After the discussions were completed, representatives from three agencies were invited to attend the meeting and respond to inquiries: the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food for the Beijing-Shanghai Region, the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, and the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region. After the councilors raised their inquiries, the central government agencies responded separately. First, Shen Guanya, the representative from the Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, responded, dividing the content into three categories: (1) Regarding the resumption of factory operations, the takeover of factories is primarily handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, among the factories already taken over, some have not yet resumed operations due to unresolved property disputes. (2) Regarding the handling of housing, the bureau has taken over a total of 8,000 buildings, including 3,000 enemy properties and 300 puppet properties. Of the enemy and puppet properties, apart from over 300 buildings planned for allocation to agencies relocating to Shanghai from the rear, the rest are intended for sale. As for the more than 4,000 civilian houses, most have unresolved property disputes. In the future, the bureau will consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Third Military Region, and other relevant agencies to discuss handling methods. In principle, priority will be given to introducing civil servants relocating to Shanghai from the rear for rental purposes. (3) Regarding the clearing of warehouses, since November 9th of last year, after inspecting warehouses, over 1,000 locations have been inventoried. As for the goods stored in the warehouses, apart from a portion of miscellaneous grains, most have rotted, which is also a fact. The reason for the rotting is due to prolonged storage in the past, and not due to negligent management after the takeover. The above-mentioned goods are currently being sorted out. Next, Li Chongnian and Wang Daren, representatives from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food for the Beijing-Shanghai Region, responded, stating: (1) Adequate food reserves have been properly arranged by President Song and Minister Xu in consultation with Shanghai's gentry and merchants. (2) Fluctuations in grain prices cannot be attributed to a single cause, but insufficient grain supply is indeed a major factor. The whole world is currently experiencing famine, which is not unique to our country. (3) The amount of enemy and puppet grain received is very small. Finally, Guo Kexi, representative from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, responded, stating: (1) Most factories were shut down at the time of takeover, but have now gradually resumed operations. (2) This office has taken over 626 factory units, transferred 142 units, resumed operations in 103 units, returned 148 units, and auctioned off 176 units. Only 57 units have not yet had a decision made on how to handle them. (3) Regarding the placement of workers, both Shanghai workers and workers relocating to Shanghai from Chongqing will be considered and handled fairly. After listening to the responses from the representatives of various agencies, the councilors still felt that the content was too brief and repeatedly raised questions, requesting the general assembly to forward them to the relevant central government agencies for further written responses. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Election of Seven Resident Committee Members</p>
<p>The fourteenth meeting and closing ceremony were held in the afternoon. Thirty-six people, including Speaker, Vice Speaker, and councilor Feng Youzhen, attended in a lively atmosphere. Speaker Xu Jiqing presided over the meeting. Li Guiyong and Yan Ze, representatives from the Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, reported on the work since its establishment and the receipt of relief materials. Subsequently, proposals were discussed, and were passed, amended, or reserved accordingly. After a ten-minute break, seven resident committee members were elected. As a result of the election, Feng Youzhen, Xu Shihao, Shen Chunhui, Wang Yansong, Fu Tongxian, Zhou Xuexiang, and Zhu Su'e were elected as resident committee members.</p>
<p>Emergency Motion Introduced</p>
<p>Subsequently, Councilor Feng Youzhen introduced an emergency motion, appealing to the Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and requesting the National Government to take effective steps to resolutely prevent it, in order to safeguard the foundation of the country. It was unanimously passed by a show of hands, creating a lively and tense atmosphere. At the same time, Councilor Feng also drafted a telegram to the Chairman and telegrams to Mr. Mao Zedong, Mr. Zhu De, and other members of the Communist Party. These telegrams were also passed at the general meeting (telegrams recorded separately). Then, a declaration was passed (see below). The fourteenth general meeting then concluded.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony; Mayor's Address</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, the closing ceremony was held, presided over by Speaker Xu. After performing the ceremony, Xu delivered a closing address, praising the councilors' spirit of deliberation and expressing his satisfaction with the successful conclusion of the meeting. He also hoped that after the recess, they would continue to work hard, provide opinions at any time, and assist in municipal construction to benefit the citizens. Then, Mayor Qian delivered an address, briefly stating: The council is the body for formulating plans, and the municipal government is the agency for implementing these plans. Today, on behalf of the municipal government, I guarantee that all resolutions of your council will be thoroughly implemented by the municipal government. Although your council has now adjourned, the responsibility of collective discussion by you gentlemen is over, but the responsibility of you gentlemen to assist and supervise is not lifted due to the adjournment. I would like to once again request that you gentlemen continue to maintain your original intentions, continue to provide guidance, and work together to build a new Shanghai!</p>
<p>Vice Speaker Xi Expresses Pleasure</p>
<p>After the Mayor's address, Vice Speaker Xi Yushu then rose to speak, briefly stating: Over the past two weeks, the councilors have spoken freely and without reservation, giving an excellent performance. I am extremely pleased that the meeting has successfully concluded. The Mayor is humble and sincerely accepts public opinion, which is admirable. In the future, I hope that the municipal government and various bureaus will pay more attention to the opinions of this council. After the speech, amidst the melodious sound of military music, the first meeting of the historically significant Shanghai Provisional Council came to a close.</p>
<p>After the meeting adjourned, Mayor Qian hosted a banquet for all the councilors at the council venue, and invited heads of various agencies to accompany them. After an hour, the guests and hosts dispersed in high spirits.</p>
<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>The Provisional Council closed yesterday afternoon and issued a declaration, the main points of which are as follows: (1) At this time of national restoration, all regions are gathering to recover from past assistance, and should take the construction of this city as their own responsibility, actively assisting in order to complete the ideal of a New Shanghai based on the Three Principles of the People. (2) The material construction of the city must be implemented step by step by the government, and the development of the urban and suburban areas should be considered concurrently. The original public facilities should be restored to their former appearance, and the pursuit of public health is essential to the health of the citizens. All citizens of our city must do their best to cooperate effectively with the government, so that the construction of a new Shanghai can be expected to succeed, and the citizens can share happiness and prosperity. (3) Labor unrest continues to rise, and society is uneasy. On the one hand, factories should be restored, and on the other hand, labor unrest should be eliminated. The resumption of work must be coordinated with effective measures, and to eliminate labor unrest, the minimum necessary wage for workers' livelihood must be stipulated. The government has its inherent responsibilities, and all citizens of the city should share the difficulties and work hard. (4) The city's education system is declining day by day, and colleagues are heartbroken. Therefore, an urgent appeal is made to the municipal authorities to increase education funding, which should currently account for at least 20% of the city's total budget, focusing on eliminating illiteracy, enriching the facilities of public and private schools, increasing teacher compensation, and subsidizing poor students. (5) After the restoration, the local government has a firm determination to eliminate social ills. Past bad habits have accumulated and are difficult to change, so that promotion has been difficult to achieve. The correction of social atmosphere, the government should strictly enforce the order in a passive way, and in the active aspect, it should be led by the social leadership to set an example for the general public. The public security authorities should rectify their subordinates and devote themselves to supervision. (6) After the city experienced war, public and private lands should be reorganized, and registration procedures should be simplified. Those whose houses and properties were illegally occupied, forcibly occupied, or forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets should be investigated to ascertain the facts and returned accordingly, or if requisition is necessary due to factual needs, compensation should be given. As for the imbalance in the city's fiscal revenue and expenditure, the financial authorities should seek remedies as soon as possible and establish a fiscal system. The funding required for special construction should be generously subsidized by the central government in order to fulfill the mission. (7) Our country advocates local autonomy, and the people still lack the habit of participating automatically. Therefore, on the one hand, the people's interest in politics should be aroused, and on the other hand, the established autonomous bodies should be allowed to fully exert their functions. The government should respect the status of democratically elected autonomous bodies and not interfere within the scope of national laws, so that a good foundation for democratic politics can be laid. (8) The original equipment of the city's public utilities has been severely damaged after eight years of war, and repairs and restoration cannot be completed in a short period of time. The daily supply of water, electricity, gas, and transportation to the citizens has reached its maximum limit. All citizens must understand this serious situation, strictly abide by the principle of frugality, reduce waste, and maintain the supply of public utilities so as not to cause panic in water and electricity.</p>
<h3>A Group Wearing Military Uniforms, Drunk, Beat a Passerby to Death; Yizhong Tobacco Company Accountant Deng Shuzi Tragically Dies</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Deng Shuzi, a native of Wuxi, 46 years old, resided at No. 4, Lane 1489, West Beijing Road. He had been an accountant at the Yizhong Tobacco Company for nearly 24 years. Around 7:00 PM the night before, he was invited by a friend to dine at a restaurant on Henan Road. They dispersed around 10:30 PM. At that time, Deng and two friends, Zheng and Yang, were slightly drunk and slowly returned to their residence. While walking through the intersection of Maitehurst Road and Avenue Road, they suddenly encountered twelve people wearing military uniforms, also overly intoxicated and staggering on the street. Somehow, an argument broke out with Deng. The group immediately surrounded Deng and beat him severely. At that time, Deng's friends Zheng and Yang, fearing that they would be implicated, took the opportunity to avoid the situation. When the assailants dispersed, Zheng and Yang returned and saw that Deng had been seriously injured and had collapsed on the ground, unconscious. They quickly hired a car to help Deng back to his residence, and then sent him to various hospitals for emergency treatment. However, it was late at night, and all of them refused to admit him. After a delay until 3:30 AM the next morning, they were finally able to send him to the First Branch of the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. Due to injuries to the back of his head and internal organs, he could not be saved and died at 11:30 AM. The situation was very tragic. Afterwards, his family reported the incident to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, which sent police to investigate and search for the perpetrators. According to Deng Shuxun, the victim's younger brother, who spoke to reporters, his brother was a Bachelor of Arts graduate of the University of Hong Kong, so he had a solid foundation in literature and usually enjoyed writing poetry. He was of upright character and not good at flattery. Although he was over forty, he was still unmarried. This tragic and untimely death is heartbreaking. His body has been moved to the coroner's office and is scheduled for an autopsy this morning. After handling the funeral, a request will be made to the police authorities to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice in order to comfort his spirit in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo's Treacherous Deeds on the Silver Screen; His Ugly Actions Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>The newsreel of the public trial of the traitor Chen Gongbo, filmed by the Central Film Studio, was test screened at the studio's screening room at 4:00 PM yesterday. In addition to more than a hundred people from the cultural sector, dozens of Chinese and foreign staff from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration attended. When the screen first opened, it showed the scene of Chen Gongbo being escorted out of the detention center, followed by the scene of the judge questioning him and the scene of the prosecutor standing up to accuse Chen Gongbo of ten major crimes. The irrefutable evidence of these ten major crimes was shown in the form of Chen Gongbo's appearances in films during his time in the puppet organization: (1) The ugly act of standing at attention and saluting the Japanese; (2) The shameless scene of presenting a traitorous treaty to the Japanese; (3) The despicable act of Wang Jingwei bowing ninety degrees when exchanging documents with the Japanese envoy; (4) The scene of Chen Gongbo giving a speech to the public, declaring war on Britain and the United States. When he spoke the words "declare war", the screen scene temporarily froze, and the reporter introduced to the audience that this was the most shameless scene of Chen's treachery. The final scene was Chen Gongbo arguing in court. The film lasted about twenty minutes, and Chen's treacherous and ugly actions were fully exposed on the screen.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Creates Conspiracies of Unrest; Appeal to the Government to Resolutely Stop Them</h3>
<p>The City Provisional Council passed a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting him to take effective measures to resolutely stop the Communist Party's conspiracies. At the same time, it sent a telegram to Yan'an requesting them to consider the overall situation and abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to realize democratic politics. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Chairman</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, Chongqing National Government, Greetings. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party claimed territory by force, destroyed transportation, and prevented various restoration works from being completed quickly, causing price fluctuations and increasing people's hardship. The Central Government has repeatedly tolerated this illegal behavior of the Chinese Communist Party, and in order to restore national order, it invited representatives of various parties, factions, and non-partisan social elites to hold a Political Consultative Conference. The Allied nation of the United States also sent General Marshall to mediate and organize a military team to stop military conflict in order to peacefully resolve political disputes, hoping to realize democratic politics and complete the great cause of national construction. However, the Chinese Communist Party has other ambitions and conspiracies. While the situation in the Northeast is still awaiting diplomatic negotiations, it has sent heavy troops and sneaked into various provinces, attempting to implement territorial division and split the country. If this behavior is not stopped, how can we face the loyal and brave soldiers and the people who have fought hard and sacrificed in the past eight years, and put the country on the road to long-term peace and stability? According to today's newspaper, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, Yan'an Liberation Daily, even published an absurd editorial, wantonly slandering Your Excellency, which is a reversal of right and wrong and a loss of the normal rules of a political party. Its intention is nothing more than to create chaos in order to seize power. After eight years of war, our country is impoverished and exhausted, and can no longer withstand internal strife. This council, representing the interests of 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, unanimously resolved to appeal to the Chinese Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and request Your Excellency to take effective steps to resolutely prevent it, in order to safeguard the foundation of the country. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. Xu Jiqing, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Vice Speaker, and all councilors bow in haste.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Communist Party</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Zhu De of Yan'an, and all members of the Chinese Communist Party, Greetings. (Omitted above) This council, representing the interests of 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, should be resolved by the general assembly to appeal to the Chinese Communist Party to consider the overall situation, abandon its conspiracies to create chaos, and earnestly request that you consider that our country has been devastated by eight years of war, and that the national strength and the people's strength have been depleted, and can no longer withstand internal strife. Firmly change your plans and faithfully abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, peacefully build the country, and realize democratic politics. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. Xu Jiqing, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Vice Speaker, and all councilors bow in haste.</p>
<h3>Seven Cases of Treason Reviewed Consecutively; Six Cases Including Hu Jifang Rescheduled for Further Hearing; Li Xibo's Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 17th</h3>

Native of Shandong. He studied philosophy at Waseda University in Japan and the University of Chicago in the United States in his early years. After returning to China, he taught in middle schools in Jinan and Beiping. When the war broke out, he participated in guerrilla work in Lu'an, Shandong, but was captured by the enemy and imprisoned for half a year before being released. After his release, he served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Henan Province, and then as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fifth District of the puppet Huaihai Province. Last summer, he transferred to the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Third District of the puppet Zhejiang Province. After the victory, Sun Wentong, who worked in the city's Water Police Bureau, reported him and arrested him in Shanghai. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. During the hearing yesterday, the defendant stated that he had never taken office as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Henan Province. As for taking the position of puppet Administrative Inspector Commissioner, he said that he had obtained the consent of Chen Keqiang, then the chief of the Jinghu District of the Military Statistics Bureau, who instructed him to provide information, and that he would be responsible for the matter later. Therefore, he requested the court to summon Chen for investigation. Chen is currently the Director of the Supervisory Office of the Northeast Security Command. Then, the informant Sun Wentong detailed the process. The case is complex, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (2) Jiao Baiquan: Former Secretary and Division Chief of the Propaganda Department of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. During his tenure, he was accused of dereliction of duty for extorting money from theaters such as Tianchan and Huanghou Gong Stage and was detained by the puppet court. After the victory, the High Procuratorate interrogated him and considered that he had violated the regulations on punishing traitors, and filed a public prosecution. During the court hearing yesterday, the defendant argued that he did not extort money, but that the theaters sent it voluntarily, and it was distributed equally after being collected, and even the puppet Director Liang Xiuyu took some. The court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (3) Feng Yaofu: A native of Taiwan, accused of serving as a translator for the enemy's military police on Beidang Road, and of going to the home of Wu Zhongying, the captain of the first team of the third district of the second branch of the city's youth group, to attempt to arrest Jiang Bocheng, which resulted in the death of the servant Xu Ma from being beaten. After the victory, he was reported by Wu, and the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. The defendant stated in court yesterday that he was forced to join the enemy in Taiwan at that time, and asked the court to investigate the circumstances at that time. As for the death of Xu Ma from being beaten, it was done by the Japanese. Then, Wu Zhongying detailed the process, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (4) Kang Luqiao: Former Mayor of Sanlintang Town in the puppet Shanghai County, Wang Fuqi: Former Director of the Joint Office of the Seven Townships of the puppet Sanlin Town, Kang Fu: Former Mayor of Nanxing Township in the puppet Shanghai County. Recently, they were reported to have abused their power and oppressed the people. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. The defendants all denied the accusations and submitted Huang Xiusheng and Li Zhiqian as witnesses. The court ordered a rescheduling for further hearing. (5) Luo Zhiqiang: 34 years old, native of Pudong, recently reported by the local youth group, who claimed that he served as an enemy military police informant. However, the defendant firmly denied it in court yesterday, only claiming to be a worker in the Japanese company Maomo Shipyard. The court ordered a continued investigation before further hearing. (6) Li Xibo: 36 years old, native of Shandong, accused of serving as a translator for the enemy in Dalian, and as the Deputy Director of the Administrative Section of the Taishan Sub-bureau of the puppet police station in Shanghai and the Captain of the Special Forces Brigade of the Jiangwan enemy military police. The defendant stated that he was previously a physical education teacher at the Model Middle School in Nanjing. He admitted to working in the puppet police station, but denied holding any other positions. The prosecutor stated the reasons for the prosecution, and the defendant retained lawyer Wang Shou'an to defend him. The court ordered the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 17th. (7) Portuguese Nakamura Remidis, Xue Erfa, and Hungarian Xibaoke were accused of purchasing military supplies such as gasoline and diesel for the enemy and arresting and abusing Chinese people. The defendants still strongly denied the charges. The court ordered them to be detained for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Readers' Letters Urge the Racecourse to Actively Convert into a Park</h3>
<p>To Commemorate Chairman Chiang's Great Achievements and Share Joy with the People</p>
<p>Editor: I was overjoyed to read in your newspaper on March 27th the news that "the Racecourse will be converted into a park, and the authorities are in contact." The Racecourse was originally a large gambling den, an example of imperialist economic aggression, and also a great disgrace in our country's history. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the unequal treaties have been abolished, this special area should not be allowed to continue to exist. I previously submitted a letter of suggestion to Chairman Chiang, also requesting that the Racecourse be converted into "Zhongzheng Park," both to commemorate Chairman Chiang's great achievements and to allow citizens to share the joy. At that time, it was an ideal for me, and now it will become a reality. I am secretly pleased. I now request the municipal council and the authorities to use Chairman Chiang's elegant inscription as the park's name when converting it into a park, and to cast a bronze statue so that all people can admire it. Although it cannot be like the Guangdong compatriots casting a golden statue, it will not be inferior to them. Please proceed quickly and complete the conversion before Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday to celebrate longevity without bounds, which is of profound significance. This is my humble opinion, whether it is appropriate or not, please let people from all walks of life see it for themselves. From reader Yao Datian</p>

<h3>Bulls Advance and Retreat Freely, Bond Market Rises and Falls Quickly, Chinese Stocks Flat, Foreign Stocks Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Bond buyers made persistent efforts, and Class C bonds opened at a new high of 5,000 yuan this morning. As the bulls reaped profits, they rushed to sell, and the price immediately fell back by 500 yuan to 4,500 yuan. The so-called major players in the bond market, the old bulls, refused to let go and continued to absorb them, taking advantage of the loose monetary conditions. Their chips were almost exhausted, and they were pulled up again. When the 5,000 yuan mark was broken through again, the retail short sellers were squeezed again, and the ball was kicked up again, creating a new peak of 5,200 yuan. The major players then released their chips, but then there was a lack of support, and they fell back to 4,600 yuan again. The fluctuations were extremely erratic, and people were confused. The footing was extremely unstable. There were very few opponents. The powerful factions tended to collect miscellaneous brands, and Class C bonds were also brought up. As a result, the closing prices of Class A, B, and C bonds were slightly higher than before. Class D bonds were the coldest, falling by 150 yuan alone, still oversupplied. Class E bonds also rose by a small amount. Chinese stocks experienced many twists and turns, rising and falling repeatedly. The bullish companies were in a difficult situation, riding a tiger and unable to get off, and had no choice but to continue to pull and absorb. However, it was rumored that the new organization only raised 100 million yuan, which could only absorb 200,000 shares of Yongsha. Generally speaking, people felt that their strength was insufficient and did not place too high expectations on the future of the stock price. Profiteers occasionally emerged, causing many flaws. There were many twists and turns in the morning, barely managing to maintain it. As a result, the three popular stocks, Yongsha, Meiya, and Jingfu, rose slightly. The unpopular stocks were flat. Various companies held shareholders' meetings one after another, and small stocks were more stable. In the afternoon, the asking prices were still weak. Foreign stocks were uncertain yesterday because the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to inspect them, and many closed out. Except for Yeguangxiangtai, the other stocks were overwhelmed by the supply side. As a result, except for Yeguangxiangtai, which fell very slightly, the other stocks fell back by half a percent to one percent.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Calm, Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Red Gold opened flat yesterday morning. After opening, there were still floating bulls closing out, and it fell back slightly. The monetary conditions were loose, and buyers absorbed at lower prices. The process rose slightly in peace. The major players have abandoned it and gone elsewhere, and the gold market is doubly deserted. The price hovered around the previous closing price throughout the morning. It was slightly stable at noon, but fell back slightly in the afternoon. As a result, it fell back by 15,000 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry in silver shops was listed at 160,000 yuan. Fine silver was still 1,500 yuan. Silver dollars were slightly stable, with buyers at 1,030 yuan. The shadow discount was even looser with monetary conditions, and the interest rate ranged from 12 to 17 cents.</p>
<p>The buying sentiment for US dollars in foreign currencies was still difficult to sustain, but the situation was still stable. In the morning, the low price was 1,880 yuan, and the high price was 1,905 yuan. The rise and fall were narrow, initially stable and then weak. As a result, it fell by 15 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars continued to be absorbed by powerful factions yesterday, and the situation was slightly stable. As a result, the old price was flat, and the new price rose by 2 yuan. The US exchange rate has not changed. The bank's exchange rate is still between 1,930 yuan and 1,950 yuan. Hong Kong telegraph was 395 yuan, and the rupee was 495 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Downturn Gradually Stabilizes, Spot Cotton Transactions Slightly Improve</h3>
<p>The downturn in the yarn market stopped yesterday. Although large merchants from Fujian, Guangdong, and the Yangtze River region lacked sales, the crazy drop seemed to have aroused the sales of the Beijing-Shanghai line. Although the transaction volume was not large throughout the day, the price was still firm. Small yarn and 16-count yarn recovered by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The increase in large-brand goods was limited, and fine yarn and Shuangqian were still not improving. The reason was that the Textile and Construction Company's auction was held yesterday afternoon as scheduled. 40-count single yarn and 42-count double-stranded yarn fell by 90,000 yuan at most. The remaining counts only fell by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the decline was much slower than in previous times. In addition, 28 kinds of wool fabrics and 2 kinds of blankets were sold. As usual, cloth will be sold today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton rose by 16 to 25 pounds, with the near-term American dollar at 28.08, the long-term at 28.27, and the Middling spot at 28.63. The local spot cotton market was still weak, but the transaction volume improved slightly. The Green Textile and Construction Company also absorbed Middling and Brazilian cotton, with a transaction volume of 20 bales. In addition, there was no news of private yarn mills purchasing.</p>
<h3>Wool Fabrics Summer Sales Gradually Rise, New Arrivals of Plain Velvet</h3>
<p>The summer sales of wool fabrics have continued to rise recently. Although wholesale sales are still limited, the transaction volume in door shops is quite large. At the same time, small batch wholesale business is also good.</p>
<p>The new blue, gray, dark blue, and plain velvet on the market have a width of only 54 inches. The selling price is 52,500 yuan per yard, which is very suitable for sale as women's cheongsam fabric. This is the first batch shipped by the American wheel, and it is said to be produced in Australia. The cost is only 27,000 to 8,000 yuan per yard, so people in the industry are rushing to order.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Slightly, Soybean Oil Continues to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market tended to be firm due to cloudy weather. Both japonica and indica rice rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. The supply of cloudy yuan rice was scarce, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan. White yuan rice was still mediocre. The closing prices of various goods also softened. Wenzhou and Qingdao inquiries for flour were slightly increased, and the price tightened by 100 yuan. Bran was digested in the mainland and also rose by 100 yuan. Soybean cake rose first and then fell back, but it was still difficult to prosper. Soybeans were tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon. The actual consumption was sluggish. The supply of raw peanuts was abundant, and the digestion was sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame transaction volume was sparse, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans were flat, and corn digestion was sluggish. The oil market was weak and difficult to stand due to the continuous arrival of goods. Crude oil fell by nearly 1,000 yuan, and soybean oil continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The future situation of each grain still depends on the downstream.</p>
<h3>10,000 Tons of American Wheat Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>The William J. O'Toni, managed by Fulai Company, arrived from the United States with more than 6,000 tons of wheat and berthed at floating pier 32.33 for unloading. The Pi-Pi-Ai Alanck, managed by Jardine Matheson, transported 4,000 tons of wheat from Vancouver. Due to the lack of vacant docks and floating piers in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port, and will be imported as soon as the number of ships in the port decreases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Not Easy to Turn Around</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still weak. The association's plate price for medium sugar white opened at 46,000 yuan, and then was 45,500 yuan, down another 500 yuan. The retail price of Shi-Lu Qing sugar was 48,000 yuan. The price of Shi-Lu white sugar was 50,000 yuan, followed by 48,000 yuan. Ordinary rock sugar was 90,000 yuan. In view of the recent light customer sales and poor digestion, it is not easy to turn around temporarily.</p>
<h3>Market Rumors of Fluctuations in the US Exchange Rate, Authorities Solemnly Deny</h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been rumors in the market that there will be fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank, the exchange rate of the Central Bank's US telegraphic transfer is always 2,020 yuan for spot, 2,120 yuan for May, 2,220 yuan for June, and 2,320 yuan for July, and has never changed. This is purely speculative merchants creating rumors in an attempt to profit.</p>
<p>In addition: The foreign exchange market has also gradually decreased due to the continuous drop in gold prices in recent days. This morning, the buying price of US exchange at Chase Bank was as follows: telegraphic transfer was 1,870 yuan, check was 1,860 yuan, and US bill was 1,840 yuan. The exchange rate for British currency has not been officially announced by the authorities. The current settlement method is to calculate based on the market price of the day, plus the exchange fee.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the financial sector, our country's foreign exchange fund is extremely abundant. In addition to the 500 million US dollars that the government has allocated when opening foreign exchange, the authorities have recently negotiated with the United States for a large loan, which is quite large and the progress will soon mature. This loan will be used to stabilize our country's monetary system, so the financial future is very optimistic.</p>

<h3>Huang Shao's Farewell Speech Examines Zhejiang Province Education</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Zhejiang Province Chairman Huang Shaohong will be transferred to the National Government Committee and will soon leave Zhejiang. The provincial capital held a farewell meeting for him. Here is an excerpt from Chairman Huang's speech at the meeting, regarding the need to devote efforts to the basic work of education in the expectation of the ideal new Zhejiang, saying: The ideal new Zhejiang should establish democratization and industrialization, but how can we achieve democratization and industrialization? It cannot be achieved by empty words, and we must devote efforts to the basic work of education. Two years ago, a slogan of Education Year was proposed for the construction of Zhejiang Province, because without popular education and undeveloped science, the goal of industrialization and democratization cannot be achieved. In the future, if we want to truly achieve the goal of democratization and industrialization, we must earnestly promote education. After the victory, the head of state has put forward the slogan of "Education First in the Nation-Building Period." Therefore, reviewing Zhejiang's education, although there has been some progress in recent years, it is still a superficial and quantitative achievement. If we really want to achieve the goal of popular education and developed science, we still need to strive for the enrichment of education facilities and content. Today, at the time of departure, I sincerely hope that the local elders, education authorities, and young students of Zhejiang Province will make fundamental efforts in education to complete the greatest and most glorious mission of the country, the nation, and the local area of Zhejiang.

Unexpectedly, the young players of Longjie displayed rapid improvement in their skills. In the first half, Wang Buyun's shot gave them a 1-0 lead. In the second half, they briefly led again at 2-1.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Senators Question Relief Agency, Settling a Relief Account</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Airmail, April 1, Sent by Our Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Ever since senators raised the question at the three sessions of the Political Council, "The Guangdong branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sits idly by while Guangzhou disaster victims are left unaided. Dozens of people die of starvation in Guangzhou every day, yet their flour has never benefited ordinary people. How should this be improved?" it has attracted great attention here. Because this is a matter of vital concern to Guangdong, how can all parties ignore it? Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Provisional Council, the body representing public opinion here, scheduled a policy report by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch at the afternoon session of the fourth day of the second session, which began on March 25.</p>
<p>How Many Impoverished People Benefit?</p>
<p>The event was undoubtedly captivating, as the general public believed that the agency had been poorly managed with many malpractices since its establishment and distribution of relief supplies. How many impoverished people have actually benefited? Recently, several boxes of the agency's milk were stolen, and 25 million yuan were fraudulently claimed. The sale of canned beef, milk, milk powder, and other relief supplies was entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. All items were priced per unit, and each unit cost more than 10,000 yuan to purchase. Is this in line with the principles of relief? Therefore, the public voiced their dissatisfaction, and many newspapers published reports criticizing the agency. As a result, everyone's attention was focused there, to see how this relief organization would settle this relief account!</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 28th, the meeting hall resembled a classroom. The entrance was decorated with colored streamers. Facing the entrance was a platform elevated about a foot above the ground, serving as the chairman's stand. Facing the platform were tables arranged in seven rows vertically and horizontally. Many chairs were placed diagonally on both sides, serving as seating for reporters and guests. The arrangement of the meeting hall was exceptionally simple. Apart from the colorful paper strips released from the central skylight and the several pots of fresh flowers on the chairman's stand, which complemented the newly painted soft, milky yellow walls, only a few banners provided some decoration. The most captivating scene unfolded here.</p>
<p>Relief Agency Turns a Blind Eye to Death</p>
<p>At exactly 3:00 PM, it was the turn of Ling, the director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch, to present the report. Carrying a stack of reports, he arrived in a grand procession with twenty-eight advisors, experts, and staff members, along with Mr. Adams, a foreign friend from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, filling the seats for reporters and guests. Director Ling, accompanied by a secretary, walked onto the chairman's stand. In a designated spot next to the chairman, he hung an enlarged statistical chart, fearing that the senators might not be able to clearly see the written report. After a brief introduction by Chairman Lin Yizhong of the council, Director Ling began his report. Director Ling knew that the public was not very satisfied with him, so he launched a preemptive strike. Speaking in Mandarin with a Hakka accent, he first explained the structure of the agency, stating that the purchase and sale of various relief supplies were handled by a purchasing and sales office established by the Finance Department of the headquarters and were unrelated to the branch office, especially to "himself." Furthermore, everyone believed that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had received a large amount of supplies and criticized them for turning a blind eye to death. However, how many supplies had the United Nations shipped to China? The total value was 100 million US dollars, amounting to more than 4 million tons, but only a small portion was allocated to Guangdong. In the past four months, the actual relief flour received was only 3,500 tons. If distributed to the 35 million people in the province, each person would only receive one pound. Moreover, some of it was distributed directly as relief, while some was used for work relief. The first batch of rice, though 9,000 bags had arrived, was American rice, divided into eight types. According to the United Nations regulations, one-third was to be distributed directly as relief, while two-thirds were to be sold at a subsidized price to stabilize prices. However, this was handled by the purchasing and sales office. Now the price of rice has risen to over 40,000 yuan per dan (a traditional unit of weight). Why is it not being distributed for relief? This is the intention of the foreigners, because these experts have long ears and have heard that the Four Banks are purchasing white rice to hand over to Japanese prisoners of war to take to Tokyo, so they firmly refuse to distribute it, waiting until the Japanese prisoners of war have left.</p>
<p>Seven Boxes of Milk Stolen from Warehouse</p>
<p>As for the reports of over twenty boxes of milk being stolen from the warehouse, only seven boxes of milk were actually lost. Valued at over 200,000 yuan at market prices, and the total value of all canned goods was 400 million yuan, the theft of 200,000 yuan was a small amount, accounting for only one percent of the total. Moreover, the principle has been established that if the thief cannot be found, all warehouse employees will be required to compensate for the loss at the original price. After Ling explained, he proceeded with a report based on the written document, which took over an hour. It was not until the chairman intervened that he requested a few more minutes of indulgence. During the report, he acted like a teacher, holding a ruler in his right hand and a notebook in his left, running to the front of the stage and explaining the charts. After the senators patiently listened to his words, they could no longer endure it and launched a fierce barrage of questions like bombs. First, one senator questioned Director Ling: "Before the establishment of the purchasing and sales office, was the manager in charge of selling flour also held by you, Director Ling? Did the Huang Zhisheng case, where a merchant reselling subsidized bread committed fraud, occur during your tenure, Director Ling?"</p>
<p>Huge Sum of Public Funds Fraudulently Claimed</p>
<p>He also said: "I heard that 25 million yuan of public funds from your agency were fraudulently claimed. Is that true?" Then, one senator after another stood up and asked questions like machine guns, expressing their emotions and barely suppressing their overly aggressive questioning, passionate applause, and indignant emotions, which filled the meeting hall for three and a half hours.</p>
<p>Everyone focused on: (1) Relief items not reaching the impoverished and falling into the hands of non-impoverished individuals. (2) The inappropriate policy of entrusting merchants to resell subsidized flour and bread. (3) Poor management of the agency, with numerous malpractices, and those who should not have benefited were enriching themselves. (4) What is the truth about the stolen milk and the 25 million yuan being fraudulently claimed? This shows the lack of strict management. (5) Numerous errors in the figures in the written report, indicating negligence in handling affairs. (6) The evidence in the Huang Zhisheng fraud case is solid, so why has it not been strictly handled for so long? (7) The winter relief funds report shows that they were distributed in January, but many counties have still not received them. (8) What standards are used for the distribution of relief supplies to various counties? A total of more than seventy questions were raised. Director Ling stood up and answered each one, invariably stating that the entrusting of merchants for resale was by order of the headquarters and requesting evidence of corrupt acts, promising to strictly handle them. He said that only seven boxes of milk were stolen, and the 25 million yuan were fraudulently claimed on February 21 and discovered on March 2, but this responsibility lies with the Central Bank because the three seals on the check were all forged. He said that he would be responsible for the errors in the figures in the written report...</p>
<p>Do Not Be Vague, Do Not Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>However, these answers did not satisfy the senators. Especially when senators raised the issue of numerous improprieties in the distribution of flour, Director Ling replied that if there was evidence, he would certainly handle it strictly. This angered one senator, who said loudly and forcefully: "Public opinion must have a basis. It is not necessary to produce evidence. If you insist on having all the evidence before strictly handling it, then the dark secrets of society will never be improved. I hope that Director Ling's answers will not be vague or shirk responsibility."</p>
<p>The time had exceeded two hours, and the electric lights were all on. The senators, concerned that disaster victims were in dire need of aid and that the relief agency was poorly managed, causing disputes, unwittingly allowed the time to extend. Finally, one senator said earnestly: "Director Ling, please understand that the questions raised today are all in good faith. In the future, what we hope is: (1) Because of the difficulty of transportation, rice cannot be transported here, but can you find a solution? (2) Please make the distribution of relief supplies public in the future." He concluded the questioning with these two hopes.</p>
<h3>The Gunfire That Destroyed Peace Shattered the Dreams of the People of Nantong</h3>
<p>— Nantong Correspondence, March 28, Sent by Yao Wei</p>
<p>After the news that the Executive Headquarters would arrive in Nantong spread, the small ancient city and its 200,000 residents felt as if their heartstrings were pulled tight, waiting for the Executive Headquarters, the savior holding the power to grant them peace and a secure life. From early morning on March 18, everyone began to wait, until 6:00 PM when they truly knew that the savior had arrived. Although it was raining and a sharp, cold wind was blowing, teams of students and crowds like tides expressed their welcoming enthusiasm with the utmost excitement and action.</p>
<p>Mr. Cooke appeared amidst the cheers of the crowd. On the makeshift platform, he responded to the people's hopes, saying: "We will begin to discuss and resolve your problems."</p>
<p>People were comforted and grateful to the Executive Headquarters. They shouted: "Long live the Executive Headquarters!" The crowd, like a tide, surged, pushed forward, and left with cheers and imagined smiles.</p>
<p>Buried in Indoor Work</p>
<p>The Executive Headquarters carries the hopes of 290,000 people in Nantong. How are they living? Naturally, the first two days were inevitably filled with banquets, from feasts to evening parties. These were small favors that the people were willing to do for the Executive Headquarters, hoping that the Executive Headquarters could discuss and make decisions for lasting peace in a peaceful atmosphere. At several banquets, Mr. Cooke said: "Many issues between the Communists and Nationalists are ridiculous. For example, when both sides are arguing, they even calculate the bricks and tiles of the blockhouse. But these are all small and ridiculous things." Because most of the days in Nantong were rainy, they could not help but bury themselves in their rooms. Our ally, Mr. Cooke, and his aide, Mr. Brandt, were relatively lonely. Because of the language barrier, the number of visitors naturally decreased. However, Mr. Cooke was not tired of this life, because he said that his working hours in Beiping had exceeded twenty hours a day, and now it was relatively leisurely. Even on sunny days, he preferred to be indoors. Brandt's life was only lively when he was with the interpreter. Colonel Hsiao spent every day reading some Shanghai newspapers. As the leader of the group, he did not go out much. During the talks, there was no sign of anything on his words and actions. He was very quiet, spoke with a Beijing accent, and often loved to wear a pair of cloth-soled soft shoes. Although he was a fat man, he walked without a sound. The representatives and aides on the government side were able to quickly grasp the time and complete their work. The rest of the time was spent in their activities. Sometimes they also looked for some indoor sports, such as playing table tennis and badminton, which also served as indoor games. The Communist leader, Mr. Han, did not laugh much. Perhaps, except when he and the other Communist representatives talked about some exciting things in the past, we could not easily see his smile! The Communist representatives and aides were mostly together, playing cards, talking about the past and the future. Most of the time, they read newspapers and books, and then sang songs. They also had two special correspondents from the Xinhua News Agency's Central China branch, one of whom was a woman, but she was also quiet in her activities. At the same time, they were responsible for reporting, so they had to take time to write articles.</p>
<p>Everyone Felt Mysterious</p>
<p>These many staff members were distributed in various rooms every day, each doing their own thing. The only time they gathered together was during mealtime. At first, breakfast had to be eaten collectively, but later it was democratized. Whoever wanted to eat what, they would call separately to their rooms. The two meals in the evening were alternately Chinese and Western, to suit the tastes of Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>In their way of life, they were very harmonious and unrestricted. The joyous laughter from storytelling often vibrated between them. They would also casually talk about democracy and liberation, but without arguing about anything. The Executive Headquarters was working in this way, and everyone felt it was too mysterious. Yes, even the reporters who lived with them could not know how long this mystery would continue!</p>
<p>Gunfire in Baipu Town</p>
<p>Just as the hope of peace filled the hearts of more than 200,000 compatriots in Nantong City, and peace negotiations were unfolding in the Executive Headquarters, the sound of gunfire that destroyed peace came again in Baipu Town, a contested area between the Communists and Nationalists 60 miles from Nantong County.</p>
<p>On the stormy and dark night of the 25th, a bloody battle broke out. Naturally, it was a small-scale battle. More than 100 Communists attacked. As a result of the battle, the Communists suffered more than a dozen casualties, and the Nationalist army suffered one casualty. But the sound of gunfire that destroyed peace awakened the slumber of the peace-loving people in the darkness. Was it peace? They were waiting for the mediation of the Executive Headquarters!</p>
<p>On the 28th, a sunny spring day after a long period of rain, Mr. Cooke and the leader of the government representatives, Mr. Hsiao, and many others, carrying bread, fruit, towels, toothpaste, and other necessities, went to the Jiangbei Hospital to comfort the soldiers injured in this civil war. What they brought back was endless sighing! "War is cruel!" "Peace is coming, right?" The reporter prays silently on behalf of the people of Nantong and northern Jiangsu! (Nantong, March 28)</p>
<p>Nationalist Army Defends Shenyang City</p>
<p>Defensive fortifications piled up at intersections in Shenyang City. Soldiers of the Youth Army's 207th Division stand guard with guns. Since the Nationalist army took over Shenyang City, the security situation has been improving, and the people are feeling more secure. The number of shops reopening is increasing.</p>

<h3>Save the Children Who Have Lost Their Mother's Love</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Every child in the world has a mother, and every mother loves her own child. But not every child is blessed with the grace of a mother's love. So we say, "Only children who receive a mother's love are happy!"</p>
<p>A mother's love is not only an important element in the structure of a family, but also a precious thing in the course of an individual's life. Of course, it will also contribute a solid foundation to human and world peace, because human sympathy and mutual love are the sublimation of human motherly love.</p>
<p>The impact of a mother's love on an individual's life is, in reality, a kind of educational force. Because the essence of education is the change of behavior and the transformation of experience, which my teacher Mr. Dong Renjian calls "transformation." Mothers instinctively protect their children, and they are the closest people to everyone—virtually the first teacher in life. Therefore, their ability to "transform" is the strongest, their impact on the development of an individual's personality is the greatest, and their relationship with education is the closest.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between a mother and education is so close, and since emotion and education are considered inseparable in modern educational thought, according to the research of general psychoanalysts, the emotions and attitudes of a mother are sufficient to influence the pattern of a child's entire personality development. In other words, a person who receives a mother's love will have a pleasant, confident, and active personality, while a person who does not receive a mother's love will have a depressed, timid, and passive personality. Their life will be unhealthy, their behavior will be abnormal, and they will not be able to live happily with others. Because they have not received the response of a mother's love, they simply do not understand what love is, let alone love their family, society, country, world, and humanity with their love!</p>
<p>We know that in this world, there are many children who are very happy because they have received great motherly love. But there are also many children who are trapped in the abyss of sorrow because they have lost their own mother, lost this great motherly love. For this group of unfortunate children, from the standpoint of family happiness, social cooperation, national prosperity, and world peace and human progress, we ask everyone—especially the fathers who have married a second wife—to save this group of children who have lost their mother's love!</p>
<h3>Adopted Daughter's Song</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>'Magpie, magpie, chattering, don't adopt this child; raise her up to be a money-losing burden, selling fields and land to compensate her; she wants a coat made of Nanjing satin, a skirt of Beijing gauze, a complete dowry prepared, shoes with embroidered flowers all over.'</p>
<p>This is a folk song about raising daughters in old-fashioned families. In this song, one can see how traditional Chinese families in the past held a "valuing boys over girls" concept!</p>
<p>In today's era of gender equality, it is necessary to eradicate this unreasonable concept of valuing boys over girls.</p>
<p>However, under the current social conditions, I believe that there are still many old-fashioned families that hold this unreasonable view, which seems to be a problem worthy of discussion for those who study women's family issues.</p>
<h3>Reason for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>An old man named Aceco Blanc, aged fifty, in San Francisco recently filed for divorce from his wife. His reason was that his wife takes twenty-seven cats to bed with her.</p>

<h3>The Psychological Obstacles to Women Engaging in Social Work (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cai</p>
<p>Since ancient times, China has held the concept of valuing men over women. As recorded in the Book of Songs: "When a son is born, he is laid on a bed, dressed in fine clothes, and given a scepter to play with. His cries are loud, his future bright, and he will be the lord of his family. When a daughter is born, she is laid on the ground, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and given a spindle to play with. Her concern is to be proper, and her only thought is of food and drink, lest she cause sorrow to her parents." From this, it is clear that boys and girls were treated differently from infancy. This concept has persisted from ancient times until now for thousands of years. With the exception of a few intellectuals who have been influenced by new ideas and have slightly changed, this strong patriarchal atmosphere remains deeply ingrained in all levels of Chinese society. The cultural system that evolved from this concept is the imposition of fallacious views such as the "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" and "A woman without talent is virtuous" on women. This traditional concept not only inflicts mental pain and oppression on women, but also creates a feeling of inferiority in their minds, making them believe that they are truly inferior and incapable of being equal to men. The influence of this toxic legacy of the old moral code for thousands of years has created a sense of inferiority in women's minds, so they dare not, and even think they cannot, compete with men in society. This feeling of inferiority is one of the psychological reasons that hinder women from engaging in social work.</p>
<p>Chinese women have long been subjected to the oppression and restraint of male power. The scope of their daily lives is confined to the extremely narrow confines of the family. It is said, "A woman does not leave the house for ten years," and "Deep palaces and closed doors, guarded by eunuchs; men do not enter, women do not go out." Under these circumstances, women have very few opportunities to be close to the opposite sex, and it is evident that their opportunities to contact the outside world are even fewer. The custom of foot-binding and piercing ears is a sign of preventing women from contacting the outside world. Since women's daily lives are limited to the family, they naturally lack interest in social life. Although modern women may not be subject to this restriction, it is still a common phenomenon that family education in China is stricter for girls than for boys. Generally, parents still prohibit girls from freely participating in various social activities like boys. This kind of family education is enough to cultivate the habit of women's activities being confined to the family. They lack a broad interest in social activities, and as a result, their views are narrow, their vision is limited, and they only see the small world of personal activity. The influence of this historical family education, which cultivates narrow interests and views, is enough to hinder women from having a broad interest in social activities, resulting in the psychological reason that prevents them from engaging in social work.</p>
<p>Usually, women are not responsible for anything other than bearing children and managing household affairs, aside from family and society. This has not only formed a traditional social custom, but has also cultivated a view and attitude of reliance on men in women. They believe that it is right to entrust the economic responsibility of themselves and their families entirely to men. Even when women have productive duties in the family, they are in the position of helping men, which is subordinate rather than primary, thus cultivating a sense of reliance in women. After a considerable period of time, this psychology becomes a habit. They feel comfortable living a dependent life without realizing it. They live an irresponsible life without effort, and as a result, due to inertia, they are unwilling to have any more attempts to break new ground and overcome difficulties, and they lack this kind of courage. Human mental activity always takes the shortest path, as psychologists tell us. Therefore, they develop an attitude and habit of seeking ease and avoiding difficulty, and do not struggle in society. This is the third psychological reason why women cannot engage in social work due to laziness and dependence.</p>
<p>Other psychological reasons that hinder women from engaging in social work include motherhood being more important than career ambition, lack of lofty ideals, vanity, and indulgence in current material enjoyment. Psychologists classify female psychology into the "motherly type," which means that motherhood is particularly developed and all mental activities are focused on raising children. These women naturally tend to be housewives—they are very interested in housework, and they are indifferent and ignore social causes. As for women who lack lofty ideals and indulge in material enjoyment, they only pay attention to the current reality of life, and they cannot see or think about things that are further away from the present reality. Of course, relatively impractical social undertakings cannot arouse their interest.</p>
<p>Women who want true liberation and true gender equality can only participate in broad social work, take social work as a lifelong career, and strive to be an Edison, a Newton, or a Shakespeare. Only in this way can they be liberated from the power of a male-centered society.</p>
<h3>Educating Children</h3>
<p>— Liang Gong</p>
<p>"Children who know the difficulty of farming and the taste of poetry and books, and who are mindful of their reputation, can be called virtuous children." — Gao Zhongxian</p>
<p>"It is best to be content with poverty, study, observe propriety, and cultivate oneself. The word 'humility' is endlessly useful in life; the words 'diligence and thrift' will benefit descendants endlessly." — Zhu Fangbo</p>
<p>"Keeping away from wickedness is one meaning of teaching children in wealthy families; keeping away from shame is the essential meaning of teaching children in poor families." — Wen Jiexiao</p>
<p>"Those who are good at teaching children regard being morally upright themselves as the first priority." — Yan Guangzhong</p>
<h3>Model Women</h3>
<p>— Chong Jia</p>
<p>'...An educated modern woman should best produce two or three little citizens for the country within three or four years after marrying at the age of twenty-four or five. When the children are all in school, she should serve in society outside the family. At that time, she is only in her thirties, with the physique and perseverance of a young person. Clever women can even take the time to do socially beneficial work while nursing babies… All women who only know how to hide at home after getting married are abandoning themselves. In the trend of the times and the torrent of evolution, they are the dregs to be eliminated…'</p>
<p>——Translated from the original work by Mrs. Russell of England</p>

<h3>Little Black Dress</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shufang</p>
<p>Spring is coming, and little girls sometimes like to change things up. They don't always want to wear overalls, and they want to wear little skirts. Because when dancing and playing games at school, they are more stylish and more convenient than overalls, especially when wearing a short suit. A dark-colored skirt, change the tops frequently, and it looks like you are wearing new clothes all the time. The method is very simple. You can use an adult's skirt or cheongsam to modify it. The dimensions in the figure are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Materials: Any dark, plain, or checkered woolen fabric will do. If it is plain, you can embroider a few flowers on it. The straps and bust can be lined with eye-catching satin material.</p>
<p>Method: Cut according to the dimensions in the figure. Sew the skirt first, with two pleats in the front and back, with a good distance between them. Install the bust, leaving an opening of about five inches on the left side for easy dressing and undressing. Then install the straps. The back can be sewn together and installed on the back. Have the child try it on for size when placing them. The length of the skirt straps can be adjusted appropriately. The satin lining inside the bust and straps can be slightly exposed at the edges (like piping), which can further enhance the beauty of the skirt.</p>
