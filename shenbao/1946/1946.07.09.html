<h3>五人會談無形停頓　國內大局益顯沉悶　中國對召開國大事竟提出抗議　周恩來昨會馬歇爾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕五人會談今日再度休會，首都政治空氣沉悶如昨。據某權威觀察家告記者，五人會談結果，未能促使待決之問題獲得解決，各方均表扼腕，故會談之形式或將有改變之可能，依據昨今之種種跡象觀察，會談之新方式正在醞釀中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕關於六日晚五人會談之結果，除政府方面已由邵力子報告蔣主席外，中共方面報吿延安談，尙未获任何反應。在雙方無新的指示前，會談自難繼續舉行。今晚中共方面曾表示因五人會談之無收穫，三人會議可能重開，惟重開之時間與地點現尙未定。</p>
<p>〔木報南京八日電〕今日下午四時，周恩來往訪馬歇爾，談話內容約有兩點：其一爲對商談形式之研究，因基於過去三方直接會談之毫無收穫，故認爲商談形式有改變之必要，同時並報吿二次會談之經過，及雙方爭執之焦點。其次爲對調處中原衝突之商討。中共方面曾謂「如不停戰，李先念或將爲「爭取生存」而尋求他路」，絃外之音至堪注意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕民主同盟宣傳部長羅隆基，今日午後曾　周恩來後訪馬歇爾。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕中原共軍李先念部西　撤出宣化店後，中共代表團竟向軍事三人小組提出抗義性之備忘錄，　交馬師。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕中共代表團對於政府定期召開國民大會事，於七日曾對政府政　八代表及蔣主席提出畫面抗議，其中有稱：「敝方今向貴方鄭重聲明，關於國大諸問題，在未得協　以前，敝方不受貴方任何偏面決定之拘束。敝方並仍堅持速開政協綜合小組，商討國大及其有關問題之主張，貴方如仍予拒絕，並因此而引起糾紛，其　任應由　方負之。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕昨日中共方面所發表之「七七」宣言，頃已由政府方面譯成英文，由兪大　轉致馬帥，將中文稿送交隙總長，俾作商談之根據。據悉：馬帥行館今日午前舉行內部會　，對中共宣言可能提出研究。</p>
<h3>杜聿明林彪長春會談　將爲地方性談判　一切仍取决南京協商</h3>

<p>〔本報北平八日電〕杜韋明林彪星期五之會晤，係由戴伯爾門之　心所促成，新聞記者雖極重視此一富有　劇性新聞，但此間有力人士對杜林會晤，將獲何種成果，並無具體之期望。某有力人士語記者「五星元帥尙不能解决的事，一星的更不行了」。發當人否認長春會談將討論接收哈爾濱事，謂大問題沒有解決，小問題無法解決。據悉，戴伯爾門曾在平談彼促成杜林會晤原委稱，「執行部下的命令雙方指揮官往往不能實行，現在讓他們自已談談罷」設誠如其說，亦南京直接談判之地方會議。</p>

<h3>宋院長在中外記者會上暢談財政經濟事</h3>
<p>出口貿易補救辦法在考慮中　國營民營事業政府一體重視</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府改組，合糖，糧貸，進出口，國營事業，以至外商航行內河，參加和會，戰爭賠償，公務員待遇等各項問題，於昨日上午歷一小時又十五分之行政院院長宋中文氏所舉行之記者招待會上，均會廣泛論及，而發言者之心平氣和踴躍熱烈，會塲空氣之融洽，誠開記者招待會之新紀錄。按宋氏所舉行之大規模本國記者招待會，斯爲抗戰勝利後在滬之第二次。出席者除宋氏外，有吳市長國楨，彭部長學沛，及各報記者四十餘人。茲將宋氏對各項問題之答復扼要簡誌如下：</p>
<p>（一）改組政府中央並無在國民大會以前不願改組政府之意，如有必要，政府隨時可予改組。</p>
<p>（二）糧貸　甲·政府舉辦糧貸，純係根據人民要求，原意極好；乙·如糧政人員有弊，一定嚴辦；丙·長江孚中等公司，如有現任官吏參加一個錢，亦當嚴辦。</p>
<p>（三）台糖公司　已命經濟部農林部澈底查明，如有不當，立即撤消，並立即公開發表。</p>
<p>（此事請讀者參閱經濟版）</p>
<p>（四）參加和會　我國被認爲五强之一，乃各國自行承認。非我要求，倘不克以邀請國炎格參加，我人民均將深感遺憾。</p>
<p>（五）戰爭損害賠償　日本輿論界亦自承，在全部日本賠款中。中國應佔百分之七十，其他各國共佔百分之卅，因中國損害最重。將來對日和會時，我定可獲得最大數額之賠款。</p>
<p>（六）出口貿易　將由中央銀行放低利貸款，其他補救辦法亦在考慮中。</p>
<p>（七）天鈔黑市政府正與財部美籍顧問商討處　辦法。</p>
<p>（八）國營事業政府決無與民爭利之意，故各國營公司設立期限均爲兩年，此爲過渡辦法，但政府亦無令少數人獲得暴利之義務。現中紡對於財政已有相當貢獻。</p>
<p>（九）物價通貨　如國內能真正和平統一，極短期內即能不增發通貨。對此問題，日前曾請財政部長來滬，與中央銀行總裁共同研究。至對美借款，仍在磋商中，尙未至發表時期。</p>
<p>（十）航業　國營民營一視同仁，民生公司在加拿大講船，即係政府担保，且招商局亦有民營之一天。開放長江四口岸，爲補救船隻缺乏權宜之計，本人對爭取主權曾作最大努力，決不作賣權之事。</p>
<p>（十一）徵糧　徵糧為掌握食糧，安定糧價之重要措置，詳細情形，糧食部可答擾、</p>
<p>（十二）公務員待遇自蔣主席以下負責長官，幾無一日不在　求對策，並計劃逐漸恢復戰前生活水準，惟　結則視國內外情勢而定。</p>
<p>（十三）淸查接收本人極端歡迎監察院等三機關所組織之清查團分別加以淸查，按接收敵偽產業工作十分困難，最初亦十分混亂。蘇浙皖區劉攻　，爲人異常淸廉，辦事認真；平津區　越崎，廣東區林　　，本人以前且不認識，惟伊等部下是否廉潔，則不敢保證，如有錯誤，決不徇情。</p>
<p>宋　於全體鼓掌聲中辭出後，中宣部彭部長繼續答復記者詢問：彭氏首謂，關於政府與共黨談判之詳細情形，不能全部奉吿，因恐影響雙方商談之進行，並使馬歇爾特使感覺困難，　括言之，目前政府最重視者，在整軍及確定駐軍地點，如這兩點，不獲確定，則一　吿爲空談，此外尙有下列各點：（一）必須確實恢復東北主權，（二）關內與東北之交通，必須暢通無阻，故北寗路沿綫包括熱河東部之治安秩序，必須予以確切保障，（三）必須趕緊恢復山東之鐵路與煤礦並確保其治安，六月七日後共軍違反命令攻佔之各地尤須立即撤退，（四）蘇北難民回鄉，刻不容緩。</p>
<h3>中共「七七」宣言費解　國大召開在實施憲政　彭部長對外報記者發表談話</h3>
<p>下午四時宋彭兩氏及吳市長又招待各外報記者，分別答覆各項問題。</p>
<p>宋院長稱：</p>
<p>（一）於反美宣傳，中闕一般民衆對美予中國之一切援助，皆甚感激，然中共方面對美國目前政策。甚多反感，政府對中共之行動無從干涉。</p>
<p>關於糧食問題，今年秋收一般情形尙佳，可望在二個月內全國各地糧食問題逐漸好轉。四川省米價已跌至二萬餘元，倘運輸配售有辦法，各地糧價亦有步降可能。</p>
<p>宋院長發表談話畢，即由彭部長發表，對國共問題之談話如下：</p>
<p>（一）全面停止衝突之　結，在於整車及確定軍隊駐區，倘此二問題不能具體解決則雙方軍隊恐不免時有衝突。</p>
<p>（二）關於中共要求重開政治協商會議，彭部長稱：政協會四月前已召開，並經對各項問題成立協議，然在過去四月中，中共一再破壞各項協議如：（甲）武力割據東北；（乙）國府委員名單延不提出；（丙）中共軍隊編數及指揮長官名單，亦托故遲不提交。</p>
<p>（三）政府決定在十一月十二日召開國大，其用意即在使訓政得吿一段落，使憲政能開始，然中共雖在「七七」宣言中强調「改組國民黨一黨專政」而同時又宣稱政府所決定之國大日期中共不受各約束，其用意頗令人費解。然政府始終希望中共能以合作之精神共謀憲政之實施。</p>
<p>（四）中共「七七」宣言對美政府政策政擊之點甚多，目前之所謂「反美運動」，美各界頗爲注意，然參閱中共「七七」宣言，此種反美宣傳由何方發動，當不難推測。</p>

<h3>上海市十五公團　歡送何應欽上將　大會主席潘公展氏致詞歡送　何氏使命重大必能爲國增光</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國安全理事會軍事參謀團中國代表團團長兼中國駐美軍事代表團團長何應欽上將，預定本月十一日起程飛美。昨日下午七時，本市臨時參議會，地方協會，市商會，工業協會，銀行公會，總工會，市教育會，新聞記者公會，報業公會，市農會，婦女會，律師公會，會計師公會，國民外交協會，天主教公教會等十五公團，假國際飯店十四樓，聯合舉行盛大歡送會，並請吳市長國楨，錢前市長大鈞，宣司令鐵吾，各局局長暨旅滬中央委員李石曾、彭學沛、黃紹竑李漢魂等作陪。到主人潘公展、程滄波、徐寄　、杜月笙、王曉籟、奚玉書，馮有真、周斐成、周學湘等暨團體理監事約二百餘人。大會至十時許始散。</p>
<p>潘公展氏·致歡送詞</p>
<p>大會開始，首由主席潘公展氏，代表各公團向何上將呈獻全體簽名之紀念冊，並致歡送詞。略稱：今日上海十五公團，代表全市三百五十萬市民，歡送何總長奉使出國，承何總長在百忙中撥冗光臨，使吾人能對何總長表示敬意，無任榮幸。上海市民對何總長以往功績，久所敬仰，無煩鄙人贅述。何總長早年獻身革命，先則追隨國父，繼又追隨總裁，爲國效力，由廣東襄辦軍校，而統軍北伐，以至此次八年抗戰，入則運籌帷幄，出則決勝疆塲。迨核戰勝利，又奉命主持投降，在極短期內，完成使命，最近尤足爲吾同胞景仰者，即何總長因中央統一軍事機構，設立國防部，發表「告全國軍人書」，以身作則，表示謙退，領導有功軍人，達成縮編軍隊之任務，爲中國軍界開一新風氣。今何總長另有重大任務，代表中國參加聯合國安全理事會軍事參謀團任團長，並兼中國駐美軍事代表團團長，不日成行。中國今爲五強之一，凡所舉動，與世界各國息息相關，與盟邦尤其與美國今後之合作，必更求密切，以確保世界之集體安全，聯絡使命，責任艱鉅，以何總長之歷史與物望，誠爲中國代表團團長最適宜之人才，深信必能完成使命，爲國增光。上海全市市民敬視何總長之成功。</p>
<p>何應欽氏·繼致答詞</p>
<p>繼由何上將起立致答辭，略謂：今日承蒙上海市十五公團歡送，本人深表感謝。回想民國十三年入黃埔軍校，追隨主席，以後又隨主席北伐而至抗日，至今已歷二十餘年，其間大部担任軍事工作，經過許多艱難，重大任務幸能達成。此實仰賴最高領袖之領導與指示，並獲黨政軍同志幕僚地方人士同舟共濟之結果。此次赴美有二大任務：（一）與國際間相互合作，（二）促進中美兩國軍事合作及聯繫。自知關係重大，任務艱巨。奉主席之使命，又蒙社會各界之期望，本人才力有限，尚希各位隨時指教。上海爲世界最大都市之一，且爲中國經濟文化中心，上海之繁榮可影響全國。當去年日本投降後第一次來滬時，曾有所感，即過去上海建設甚多，其繁榮均在前租界區內現租界收回，領判權亦已取消，以後應將良好規模保存並更發揚光大，對過去不良風氣則應力加剷除。最近上海之豪華奢侈現象，尤當設法改善，而將力量集中，發展生產事業，其他如交通·治安·教育·衛生等等亦應能不斷改進。諸事雖極平凡，但尚希市民能認識其重要性，尤望各界先進與政府合作，打成一片，作有計劃的進行，領導民眾，協助政府建設新上海。將來回來時，深盼上海較現在更爲進步。詞畢，即舉杯高祝主席健康，及上海地方首長健康。</p>
<p>最後，李石曾氏亦根據何氏意旨，希望人民與政府充分合作，然後才能達到國際合作，世界和平。並謂蔣主席夫婦攘於三年後在中國召集一次國際集體合作機構之聯合會議，與前在美國所舉行者相同，希望何總長此去，能將此種會議優點，介紹來華。何上將因另有約會，八時先行告辭。</p>

<h3>蘇報撰文抨擊美國軍事援華</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科七日電〕蘇聯時評家伊薩柯夫在「真理報」撰文，指美國協助中國國民政府，破壞國內停戰協定，並準備發動反共運動，其結果必致使內戰更爲擴大。其文有謂：美國若能停止以軍火物資供給發動內戰之一方，則中國之內戰，必可自動停止，但美國之軍事援助，並不因世界大戰之結束而終止，反有繼續延長擴大之意，如戰具供應法案，及訓練並配備中國陸軍一百萬名之計劃等，租借供應於一九四五年八月即停止，但美政府仍以價值五千八百萬元之物品供給中國，美國政府以業已停止有效之法律爲根據，繼續以巨額戰具供給中國，而美軍在華之活動，更爲促成中國現狀之主因，莫斯科外長會議曾宣示贊成不干涉中國事件之原則，美國在華之政策，實不能　與此等原則相符云。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>經濟施政的自我檢討</h3>
<p>昨天上午，行政院宋院長在上海市政府，招待記者，聽取新聞界的意見，答覆詢問，並且表明「本人對大眾意見，素極尊重。」的確，宋院長昨天答覆各點，非常坦白直爽。例如：糧貸案，他說糧商舞弊當嚴辦，糧官舞弊更當嚴辦，決不袒護任何人；長江孚中等公司，如有官吏資本，當予處分；抬高糧價，已令主管部會澈查；中紡公司將來一定售與民營；國營航業與民營航業必一視同仁；外輪航行長江，將以客觀眼光與航商討論；希望國內團結，交通恢復，通貨就可停發，因爲「通貨膨脹，刺激物價，最感痛苦」。以上種種，都是宋院長明白率直的答覆，至少可以解釋人民從前的疑慮，也至少可以使人民知道當局還是要向「好政府」的道路上走。行政當局這種態度，這種重視輿論的作風，不能不說是政府最近進步的象徵。</p>
<p>我們於聽取宋院長的答覆以後，想在這裏再提出一個經濟施政自我檢討的問題，因爲我們認爲這是一個現實與理想是否相符的問題。今年三月間，國民黨二中全會開會時，宋院長曾向大會報告，他說：「當前最緊要最嚴重的問題，就是經濟問題。目前的經濟狀況，可以說人人都不滿意，這是勢所必然的，即本席個人，亦覺得不但不能滿意，而且是極不滿意的一個人。」宋院長這種坦白的陳述，可使我們感動；而尤其值得欣慰的，他就在二中全會裏提出了經濟急措施案，這方案規定四項原則：（一）增闢新稅源，遏止通貨之急劇膨脹；（二）新稅源應本民生主義節制資本平均地權之原則，勉力實施；（三）切實解決勞資糾紛；（四）調整公教人員軍隊官兵及產業員工之待遇，務期公平合理。根據此四原則所規定的辦法則有：（1）舉辦財產總登記，徵收一次財產稅，（2）征收交易所稅及交易稅，（3）舉辦特種過分利得稅，（4）制定國營及民營事業員工待遇糾紛處理辦法，除國營事業不得罷工怠工外，並設置勞資評斷委員會，對民營事業之勞資糾紛有強制評斷權，（5）重行調整公教人員軍隊官兵及產業員工之待遇，由上面的叙述，可知今天要解決經濟問題，決不是僅靠一個經濟部所能爲力，也決不是僅靠經濟計劃委員會討論幾十條的經濟施政綱領就可濟事，而必須有待於宋院長的決策與財政部的協力。老實說，如果離開了財政，離開了通貨，避去這最基本的問題不談，單想就經濟言經濟，我們敢說縱非此路不通，至少也將事倍功半。</p>
<p>我們老百姓今天有權向政府要求，對當前的經濟施政先作一番澈底的自我檢討。別的姑不論，單說這通過已有三個多月的「經濟緊急措施案」，請政府自問：現在已實行了多少點了？上海市設立了勞資評斷委員會及行政院調整一次公教人員待遇外，其他究竟有何成就？新稅源已闢了若干？財產總登記辦了沒有？財產稅徵收了沒有？通貨的急劇膨脹遏止了沒有？現在一切的經濟施政，對於節制資本平均地權的原則顧到了沒有？國營產業員工的待遇，有沒有比一般公教人員的所得超過得太過分？凡此，政府明明鄭重提議而經中央全會通過的議案，宋院長當仁不讓，應該重行提起各主管部的注意與檢討，然後可以判斷這些「衙門」的政績如何。我們以爲這議案改稱爲「經濟緊急措施案」，則行政院所屬有關經濟的任何部會，都有努力實行的責任，絲毫不容諉卸。否則既無「措施」，「緊急」更談不到，無形擱置的結果，勢必使當前的經濟狀況，依然如三個月以前一般，「人人都不滿意」，而宋院長也許將仍爲「極不滿意的一個人」。果如此，行政院所屬的各主管部將何以對宋院長？將何以對二中全會？更將何以對全國人民？</p>
<p>因此，我們今天不必再向政府提出什麼新要求，却只希望政府毫不隱諱的檢討它的經濟施政。</p>

<h3>歐洲和會程序問題　蘇代表持原主張　四外長昨上下午開會　目前僵局仍未能打破</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：今晨四强外長會議再度舉行，企圖打開僵局，美國務　員爾納斯與莫洛托夫激辯兩小時，莫洛托夫堅持必須先決定和會程序後始可發出邀請書，但貝爾納斯與貝文則表示可將程序問題作爲建議加以討論，但反對强迫他國接受。激辯結果，仍未能打開僵局。同日下午（上海午夜）四强外長將再度會商，事前並有秘密會談，聞法方已提出折衷方案，但是否能爲美蘇雙方接受，尙未可知。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：莫洛託夫主張分別與各國討論和約：（一）在與義·羅·保·匈·芬各國討論和約之五個委員會中，任何一委會均不准挪威參加。（二）中·法·比荷·巴西·阿比西尼亞及波蘭，僅可參加談判　大和約。（三）美國不應參加芬蘭和約。一若英·蘇·烏克蘭·白俄羅斯·澳洲·紐西·南非·印度諸國，捷克可參加五委員會中之任何一委會。（五）加拿大不准參加保加利亞和約。（六）希臘將參加義保兩國和約，南斯拉夫則參加義·匈·保，和約。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕四國外長今日舉行兩次會議，第一次在上午十一時三十分，（上海時問下午八時三十分）第二次在下午舉行。衆料四國外長當將努力打開上週抄之僵局，此一僵局乃使七月廿九日召開廿一國和平會議一事，無法爲之進展。</p>
<p>〔路透社八日巴黎電〕四國外長最近兩日之辯論，所顯示之要點有二：即（一）莫洛托夫堅決阻止召開可以決定從序條例之和平全會（二）英外相貝文與美國務卿貝文納斯亦堅決表示須維護四强以外十七國企圖否決反對和會會期或和會制定程序條例之權利。此間觀察家對過去兩次會議所得之印象，認爲莫洛托夫堅不同意發出請柬，較其欲使人接受其程序條例之建議爲更甚，至其不願邀請各國參加和會之動機，多數人皆猜測乃欲以實權置於四强手中。西方國家雖予堅强抗議，但莫洛托夫倘能度不變，則和會問題恐難有進展，故今日會關鍵仍在莫洛托夫，倘能解決和會問題，然後始能進而討論德·奧·義之政局問題。關於中國能否共同簽發請柬一事，今亦尙未解決，蘇聯反對中國參預之態度顯仍不變。</p>
<h3>蘇軍佔領區域奧人被逐出境</h3>
<p>〔合衆社維也納八日電〕奧國官方本日宣稱：蘇當局下令將奧人五萬四千名，於今日上午六時自蘇軍佔領區內，驅逐出境。據悉；紅軍卡車刻停留於各被逐奧人住宅門前，等候裝載傢具，將渠等運至其他聯軍佔領區內。蘇聯驅逐奧人之理由，爲渠等係屬德國血統。</p>
<h3>萊茵英法佔領區　展開獨立運動　一時尚難獲廣大群眾擁護</h3>
<p>〔路透社德國巴登城八日電〕以建立獨立萊茵區爲目的之運動，已在法軍佔領區內成立，總部設在巴拉蒂那特之凱塞勞登。英軍區內早已有此等運動成立，惟法當局尙未承認其爲正式之政黨。據該一運動之領袖稱，萊茵區之獨立，可爲法國之屏障，防止德國之進攻，亦可爲德法間修好之運　，而萊茵區之工業因此亦可免除因賠償而分裂。　驅區應併入萊茵獨立國，首都當設在柯勃能資，此一問題當由公民投票決定之。觀察家預料該一運動，一時恐不易得廣大羣衆之擁護，蓋以內部份于尙不堅强之故。但若萊茵區之局勢每况愈下，則失望之餘之德人，或當在企求新途徑之心理下而投奔該一運動。目前法國萊茵區內之知識階級，似均有反普士之思想，希望德國能成立聯邦基礎，以弗朗克福爲首邑。</p>

<h3>南斯拉夫表示</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾將勒七日電〕南斯拉夫副總理卡台爾。自巴黎返國後，向報界發表談話稱，南斯拉夫不能接受四强巴黎會議使特港及其週圍區國際化之決議，蓋此項決議與一九一九年之凡爾賓和約相仿，使斯洛文及克羅特民族，受不同敵權之統治，實爲對我民族之重大打擊。吾人當繼續力爭，請盟邦勿獨斷獨行，蓋吾人決不接受此項決議也。</p>

<h3>美議員考察團　發表該蘇觀感　請大部分人民對美表示友好</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓七日電〕美國會議員多人去年至蘇聯，巴爾幹，中東訪問，最近發表報吿，叙述訪問觀感。各議員一致主張自由交換學生，科學家，電影及消息，俾便維持美國與各該國之良好關係。訪蘇之觀感如次：蘇聯有非共黨人民一萬八千五百萬人，乃對美友好之巨大潛伏力量，苟我人能設法使彼等瞭解我國之誠摯願望，必可促進美蘇之友好。在蘇聯，一若在美國，大部份人民均企求和平；在蘇聯，對於改進平民之生活水準，實有巨大之需要與願望。平均而言，蘇聯人民對美並無惡感。對州於美國租借法案所予蘇聯之援助範圍，僅有極少數之蘇聯人民暸解，因美國標誌之不明顯，僅少數人瞭解其爲美方贈品，此非蘇方反對之故，實因美方缺少眼光及計劃。我人進入蘇聯之後，即可自由行動，我國訪員所拍聞之電訊，均經檢查，此點全屬事實。各訪員如有自由發表意見，必招引當局之不滿，而終須離境。舉凡一切有關事實數字，人民，消息，遊歷家及文學等之自由交換，均可去除兩國之不諒解而裨益和平。蘇聯軍準仍在大規模　續中，蘇聯發展重工業，經視消發品工業。所知之自由，蘇聯缺乏近今戰具及近代戰爭所必需之機械設備。去年秋季，蘇聯武裝部隊約有一千二百萬人。該考察團建議立即放棄對關係一切形似綏靖之政策。</p>

<p>〔改造社東京八日電〕日前陸軍省軍務局長田中隆吉五六兩日在國際法庭澈底揭穿日軍侵略中國東北陰謀後，今日再出庭答覆辯護人方面之反質問。辯護人林逸郎首問證人何以於太平洋戰爭達最高潮時退出陸軍。田中答稱：張鼓峯之戰，早感物量之威力，該戰非如報吿者所言係勝利結束之戰鬥。本人當時任砲兵險長，可斷言該次戰鬥如再　　兩日，其結果將與諾蒙汗事件相同。關於對美交涉，當時本人雖未能直接訊問，然交涉經過情形曾　密聞諸陸軍省軍事課長佐藤大佐及陸軍次官木村中將。</p>
<p>陸海軍傾軋　戰事感絕望</p>
<p>至於本人辭去陸軍職務，其理由有二：一因防空設備惡劣，陸海軍傾軋，對上司作虛偽報告。如舉實以吿，即觸忤陸相。因憂慮戰爭之將來，乃於一九四二年九月二十一日向東條表示本人對戰爭感覺絕望，請求辭職。另一原因係東條雖曰「戰至最後一人，然予深信絕對不可能，乃求東鄉外相發起政治運動，使東條下野，惟以此事有違本人反對軍人作政治運動之本意，痛感不復有現役軍人資格，乃行辭職。又關於東北事變，深信並非係爆發前匆遽計畫者。（問）證人謂一九二八年時有在東北建設王道樂土之計畫，此事係河本個人之意見，抑係田中內閣之方針？（答）係河本一人之意見。（問）證人謂一九二八年以後之日「滿」關係，係不宣而戰之戰爭狀態，其故安在？</p>

<p>駐東北華軍　謂有廿餘萬</p>
<p>（問）證人謂當時東北有中國軍隊廿餘萬，君知此等軍隊分散於瀋陽，長春，寬城子，公主嶺等處乎？（答）此事余較君熟悉，但彼等係在丘營內，並非在租界內。其次辯護人太田起立謂：證人所言土肥原曾任冀察政權顧問一事，顯屬不實。田中承認是誤。（問）冀察政務委員會之目的爲何？（答）冀察政務委會之目的，一係與日協力防共；二係與日是滿」兩方結密切關係；三係可能則隨日所欲，支配該地政治，經濟，軍事問題，但須不侵犯主權。（問）冀察政務委會何以要組織？（答）「滿洲國」成立後，南京中央政府以收復失地為國策及外交之中心，爲避免摩擦起見，在長城迤南建立中日親善地帶，以謀「滿洲國」之安全。（辯護人岡本問）關東軍之特務部係何種性質之機關！（答）特務部以現役軍人爲中心，指導「滿洲國」之政治經濟。（問）土肥原奉南大將命令往晤宋哲元在何時？（答）在一九三五年九月中旬。（問）土肥原往北平時之訓令內容如何？（答）第一為防共，第二在華北樹立自治地帶，（問）君知一九三五年十二月三十一日陸軍次官命令土肥原赴華北任冀察政權指導員乎？（答）確曾見過該命令。</p>
<p>田中屢接恐嚇信</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京八日電〕國際法庭今日續審日戰犯，田中隆吉到庭稱：中日兩國人民在滿洲發生麽擦，實爲促使日軍閥決心攫取滿洲之原因。中國意欲收回旅順，大速，並取消南滿鐵路，始發起反日運動。被告律師質間田中，檢察官是否曾告以將爲被吿作證？答稱：否。又詢以此次爲檢察官作證，曾否接受金鐵報酬：至今日為止，未受分文。美檢察官曾私下表示：滿洲情形確曾緊張，但此不足成爲日本佔據滿洲之理由。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京八日電〕田中隆吉中將，爲最近國際法庭一重要證人，曾接得匿名恐嚇信及電話甚多，向渠警吿不得再行作證。</p>
<p>圖開脫日皇罪名</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京七日電〕田中隆吉連日出庭作證，指責東條尤甚。據本社記者自密切接近田中之人士獲悉，田中此舉並非對東條實行報復，徒欲脫去日皇裕仁之罪名而已。田中自本平洋戰爭伊始，即反對東條之政策。迨至去年年底，美檢察官團來此籌備審訊事宜，田中乃大加聯絡，旋任季楠幕賓，歷數週之久。按季楠徇田中之請，前往中國一行，在華訪謁蔣主席，舉行談話，企圖使蔣主席相信日皇有免除審判之必要。</p>

<h3>榮的生綁案情節離奇　申新廠長詹榮培　竟是幕後唆使犯　串通匪徒裹應外合　警局審訊屬實今日倂解警備部</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據本報記者從警察局方面獲悉：此次綁架榮德生之匪首及從犯一部份，雖經第一妥靖區司令部捕獲解送松滬戒備司令部，惟與此率直接有關之重要主犯數名，尚未落網，迄仍在軍營當局全力偵查中，以期早日結案。而最可注意者，即為此次紙架榮德生之幕後唆使犯，竟為申新紗廠二廠廠長詹榮培（詹除任二廠廠長外，業兼任該案從犯吳志剛在本市中央路廿四號所設立之華大企大企業公司副主任）彼於事先事後均與匪方取得聯繫，裹應外合。</p>
<p>查榮德生於四月廿五上午十時彼邦後，直至五月廿一日榮氏家屬接獲榮之親筆兩二掛，囑備款美金五十萬元取贖。是日上午九時，並接得電話，囑將款項備安，分成不封口之十二萬兩包及十三萬兩包，交款地點囑待下午五時再以電話通知。當時警方會查出此打來之電話號碼為七三四四，係亞爾培路二三四號一俄人開設包店所有，匪徒化名朱者借打迨偵緝人員按址前往時，該匪早已離去。次日又來電話，囑於廿五日送款之浦石路，原先榮家委託一親戚名吳昆生者與匪徒接洽，吳因膽小推離，於是實際上為幕後唆使犯之詹榮培即毛遂自薦。廿五日送款至浦石路時，因發生軍警誤會之一幕，未能成交。廿七日上午詹又與吳志剛在華龍路錦江茶室接洽，約定廿八日將款送至福熙路康榮頓五十四號，屆時須由吳交出榮德生隨身攜帶之私人圖章二顆，以憑交款，至贖款總數昨報載為三十九萬五千元，惟據詹榮培在警局所供最初匪力會榮價美金兩百萬元，後減至五十萬元，其中十萬元在交款時即為吳志剛取出私人吞沒。</p>

<h3>糧食部發表　辦理糧貨經過　呈政院答覆程檢察使糾舉</h3>
<p>關於糧貨案，江蘇檢察區程監察使前會向行政院提出糾舉，認為有選法舞弊之重大嫌疑，當經行政院令節糧食部依法徹查，糧食部奉令後，即將辦理糧貨經過，呈復政院，茲據糧食部公佈該項復文，原文如下：「案奉均院三十五年六月二十一日節京八字第二七一六號訓令開：」「監察院江蘇監察使程中行，為上海市糧政特派員楊錫志等辦理糧貨，遠法失職，提出糾舉到院，合亟發原就舉書，令仰迅速依法徹查核實具報此令，」等因。計檢發原料舉書一份，奉此。遵查此次辦理上海糧商貨款，係由市政府，市商會，市臨時參議會等各關聯團體之請求，因上海淪陷多年，糧食買賣被敵統制，原有規模較大信譽較著之</p>
<p>糧商組織退殘已盡，收復之初，市民糧食，全頓小本傷人及單幫小販，其後物價糧價工資運費相續高漲，商販資力有限，難於周轉，購運數量，因以減少，上海市民貪米月需數十萬石，深恐存底太薄，青黃不接之際，難乎為繼，一致認為政府有貨放低利資金，扶助；糧商充分營運，以增存量加原儲備之必要，本部以扶助糧商增強力量，使克擔負民食供應買賣任，為實施糧食營管理以來政府一貫之政策，故經令傷上海也派員辦公處會商中國農民銀行妥擬辦法，迨至本年四月一日，各方催辦甚急，乃在滬舉行會議，聽取各方報告後決定，先以十億元</p>
<p>貸放試辦　並由堪促糧政處草擬上海市親商貸辦法，經親自核閱修改，於四月三日令糧政處辦理，為求公開及鄭重計，微得３社會局吳局長開先，市區參會系副議長王書，市商徐主席寄望等同意，由社會局•市區參會•市商會•市豆米業公會•貸款銀行及糧政處，各派代表一人，組織上海市繼商貸款審核小組委員會，所有貸款商，應遵守之條款，審核委員會應負之責任，在貸款辦法及委員會組織規程內均有詳明規定，所有貸款商之審查決定，與其業務之考核，悉由委員會主持，有秩次議記錄可查，本部對於此案</p>
<p>辦理經過　自此即持審慎公開之態度所採方針及所定辦法，自省亦無錯誤，至於貸款辦法第二條關於貸款商資格一節，以貸款主要在乎確切多得糧食，其實上海糧商尚未完全辦理登記，經向市商會及豆米眾公會查詢。知糧商中具有悠久歷史雄厚責力者。已不可奪得，又鑒於上年兩次委託上海糧商購辦軍米，迄未能忠實履行契約之情形、斟酌至再，規定於豆米業同眾公會員之外，凡採購運銷商確有運銷能力者，亦得申請貸款，其目的完全在選擇較有能力之商號，確能向運區多購多運米糧來滬，以期充分發揮貸款效用，達成任務，而貸款商</p>
<p>審查決定　之重，運達議審援委員會，在核定辦法之際，初無容心於其聞，案有故意從寬規定，預留作奸地步之理，嗣因輿論主張不一，即行決定停辦，筋將貸款本息收回，各貸商於極短期內購運到滬之米達三萬五千餘市石，有表報可查。</p>
<p>上海糧政糧政特派員楊錫志，因公赴美，於本年三月十四日出國，上海糧商貸款，係於四月一日始行決定舉辦，其實貸款糧法之草擬修正，該員未及參加，目四月一日決定舉辦糧貸，至四月四日審核委員會核定貸款商號，為時不過四日，該員達在美國，決無運用可能，</p>
<p>該特派員　楊錫志，實與本案無關，由委員會主任李崇年，對於上海糧商貸款事項，原非主管，其向萬墨林介紹連益江北兩公司，經審查委員會審查通過，僅係知其有運銷來糧能力，提名介紹而已，各該公司承辦糧貨，另有保證，其辦理成績如何，應由各該公司自負其責，至於長江公司，查非李崇所介紹，糧政處秘書代理處務汪達人，週節科長任星崖，對於此次貸款，原僅辦理各項手續，迭經傳部查詢，均矢口否認有舞弊請事，惟案經上海法院及警備司令部調查偵訊，該員等究竟有無刑事嫌疑，自應聽候</p>
<p>依法辦理　至在行政方面有無遺失責任，亦擬俟刑事部份確定後，再行核辦。（原發糾舉書，糧商貸款辦法，審核委員會組織規程，迭次會議記錄，從略。）</p>

<h3>冒領公款二萬萬　窮教員　發橫財　事敗捉將官裹去</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞外灘六號資源委員會湖南電氣公司，於四月十八日由渝財部匯來二萬萬元，係由航空掛號信附寄支付書一紙，該款須向中央銀行國庫支取，因該信並不注明詳細地址，是以郵局無法投遞，逕送至南京市瞿真人路湖南會館，交由該館轉交。當時賬房蓋章後，隨意收下，不知為重要函件，就拋置於賬桌，為日己久，外層信封，略有損壞。適有湖南籍陳訓者（年三旬）寄居館內，新近在中華職業教育社充任英文教員，得暇時輒在賬房間走動、該函被其窺見、審視長久、發覺內有鉅額支付紙，於是攜至中行國庫局詢問領款手續，距答該款係屬公款，不能直接領用，需先轉戶，而後憑機關收據支付，於是陳竟偽造湖南電氣公司經理方熊，稽核主任王乃敏，會計主任李鎮坤名義，私鐫公司圖章長方各一枚，至五月廿七日向中央銀行申請開戶第卅號特種基金存款，遂領取公庫支票一冊，比至六月五日，開始購買自由車一輛，隨簽給支票一紙，計五十萬元，廿九日又領五十萬元，得款後，兌金鐲兩副，金耳環一付，價逾八十餘萬元。直至前日（六日）中行國庫局發覺湖南電氣公司有二家，且存款有不符之嫌，經嚴查後，始悉特種基金二萬萬一戶存款係嚴假冒名義，於是報告黃浦分局，經分局長社醇，刑事股長周光輝•巡官姚鴻章•營長夏長根•李文清•吳其蘭•李斌•趙奎振等，者手審查，拜派員駐守於中行，不意於昨日上午十時餘，陳訓又冒中美材料行支票五十萬，購買花錢為由，經向中行支取，當被便衣警員逮捕，帶局預審，直認侵佔不畏•尚有數次簽發支票，計法幣一千五百萬元，擬購這奇卡車一輛，集成照相館擬採辦照相機一具，評川萬，又有匯存郵局五十萬者，均遭國庫局拒付。復派員往湖南會館抄出全屬奪首飾，套於熱水瓶底層，又吊出偽章多枚，現正嚴予偵訊，不日移解司法機關究辦。</p>

<h3>舊事重提　十年前日兵被殺案　楊文道再受審　開庭日期當不遠　最高法院對於元原判認為不當</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞十年前因日水兵中山秀雄在實樂安路被殺而遭逮捕之粵人楊文道，現已保出就醫，惟近又延請為其奔走十年之唐懷準律師，準備重受審訊、彼於最近收到最高法院發選原審法院更審之判決書，該審查早在民國三十一年十二月十七日即由最高法院判決，判決書發出日期為三十二年二月二十一日，而送達日期則為三十五年六月二十九日，先後相隔竟達三年半之久。惟據一般推測，目前既已送達，則開審日期必不致過達。該判決書之主文為「原判決撤銷，發回江蘇高等法院第二分院。」按楊文道與另一被告廣東人葉海生，均曾為高二分院判處死刑，故向最高法院提出上訴，業海生已於年前　　獄中。</p>
<p>最高法院判決理由，約可分為三團：（一）本案關鍵，在於挖孔藏匿手槍之物理學書籍一本，而「當時搜得者原為英文物理學，其後如何變為中文實用物理學，殊堪詫異！兩審法院，均未注意及此，並採此突如其來之中文實用物理學為裁判基礎，即此一點，原判決亦屬無可維持。」（二）業海生曾於審判時表演犯罪情形，但當時情形，實不能認為自由表演，且葉「喊冤喊救竟不敢高嚴，其所受之威脅為何如？而此種威脅，是否為捕房用刑逼供之結果，極堪注意。」（三）犯罪原因：「原判謂係欲擴充上訴人等所屬同仁義兩會之勢力」，是以造成嚴重事態，而實則「上訴人等所謂為，實足以促該兩會之消滅，尚何擴充勢力之可言。」該判決書對本案凶徒為何人，強調當時證人胡祥甫所指凶手「穿水兵衣服」一點，謂為不易誤認。且檢驗死者傷口之結果。證明「射擊距離約在五公分左右，如非與被告人實習之人，何敢挨近行凶？此點尤堪研索！」結論謂：「原判決所認之犯罪原因，及所採為罪證之藏搶書籍，並葉海生之自由表演，均不無可疑，應認有發回之原因。」承辦本案者，為最高法院刑事第五處，審判長推事王振南，推事羅仁博，孫保衛，劉恩樂，張則奐。</p>

<h3>戶政疑義解答</h3>
<p>問：籍設定後，是不是永久不能變動的呢？</p>
<p>答：不是的，人民有某種原因，是要除籍的。</p>
<p>問：那些州原因，要除籍呢？</p>
<p>答：戶籍法第十九條規定有下面六種；</p>
<p>一·死亡或死亡宣吿者。</p>
<p>二·喪戶中華民國國籍者。</p>
<p>三·遷往他縣有久居之意思者</p>
<p>四·因結婚離婚而轉籍者。</p>
<p>五·因被認領收養或關係終止而轉籍者。</p>
<p>六·因其他原因應除籍者。</p>
<p>問：結婚·離婚·收養·認領·可以設本籍，這裏爲什麽又規定要除籍呢？</p>
<p>答：戶籍法第十七條第三款規定，妻以夫之本籍爲本籍，則其妻在未結婚前之本籍，因結婚後隨夫定籍而應除去，否則便成一人有兩本籍。例如：本籍在鎭江之女子，與上海人結婚，一方面依妻以夫之本籍為本籍之規定，應在上海海夫方所在地設本籍，一方面在原籍鎭江，應該除籍。</p>
<p>離婚，因其夫妻關係撤銷，則妻之一方隨夫定籍之義務亦不存在，自可回復其原有本籍，或另遷入有久居之意思之地方設籍。所以離婚後，一方面在離婚前與夫同籍之籍應除去，一方面應另設本籍。</p>
<p>收養·認領之關係終止，應予除籍，理由亦同此，以收養認領，構成父子關係，則以父母之本籍爲本籍，收養認領關係終止，父子關係亦不成立，所以一方應除去因構成父子關係而設之籍，一方面因終止收養認領，而另行設籍。</p>
<p>問：個人設籍，或一家同時設籍，怎樣申請呢？</p>
<p>答：申請戶籍登記之人，謂之申請義務人，籍別登記以本人或家長爲申請義務人，申請時，向現居地或遷出地之保辦公處或區公所（縣爲鄉公所），索取聲請書，依式填寫，報由保長轉請區公所登記。</p>

<h3>從數字裏面看上海教育</h3>
<p>平均數：每卅一人中受教育者佔一人</p>
<p>上海市各級公立學校，共三百餘所，非一篇短文所能盡述，所以本文僅就訪問所得的數字材料，作一般性的報道。</p>
<p>首先，我們要問：上海的公立學校確數有多少？學生有多少，教員又有多少？下表中的數字，都是本年六月份的統計資料。</p>
<h3>生長中的上海教育</h3>
<p>本報採訪室　集體執筆</p>
<p>學生的人數一共是十一萬多，以全上海三百四十四萬人口（市府民政處五月份人口統計）來計算，每三十一人中就有一人受教育。這一個比率似乎不算怎樣低，而且事實上在學齡的人口僅祗是三百四十四萬中的一部份，再加之私立大學，教會大學以及各式各樣的私立中小學的學生總算起來，可以說教育在上海已經是相當普及了。</p>
<p>教員人數與學生人數的比例，各級學校有着很大的差別。高等學校平均每六至七人有一位教師，中等學校及西僑學校平均每十餘人一位教師，初等學校近於每四十人一位教師，而民衆學校及補習學校平均六十人左右才有一位教師，似乎社會上熱心盡心盡義務的人還嫌太少。（這裏不妨跟一九四四年紐約州的統計數字來比較一下。紐約州人口一千四百萬，公立學校學生人數一百六十萬，教員人數七萬，平均每十人中有一人受教育，每二十個學生有一位教師。）</p>
<p>關於教員資歷的不同，教育局曾經調查過一千多個小學教師和兩百多個中學教師：</p>
<p>從上表中可以看出大學畢業生當小學教師的人數不算少，這不免有些「大材小用」。另一方面，高中剛畢業就做中學教師的也有，這又恐怕「難於勝任」了，幸好百分率還不大。</p>
<p>各級學校的經費本年來每月都有增加，一月份約爲一億一千萬，二月份一億五千萬，三月份一億八千萬，四月份三億二千萬、五月份運三億三千萬。五月份的分配情形如下：國民教育二億三千萬，中等教育六千萬，專科教育六百萬，職業教育六百萬，社會教育二千萬。很顯然的，經費大部份用在國民教育上，是非常正確的方針。</p>
<p>所有公立學校的設備及教學情形，由於性質及規模的不同很難比較，事實上，除了大學專科以外，一個學校的優劣以及它的能否造就出人才，主要還在於教師的優良與否。因此，如何提高教師的待遇以使他們生活安定專心教學，實在是今日刻不容緩的課題。</p>
<h3>肅清學店　肥了的是老闆　苦的是教職員</h3>
<p>說來痛心，在什麼都拿金錢作前提的上海，一向被人視爲神聖的教育事業，亦因「銅臭」而變了質。淸高的學校竟成了商業化的「學店」。</p>
<p>這是大都市的一個特產！</p>
<p>如此學店</p>
<p>租上一幢弄堂石庫門房子，將客堂作大禮堂兼課室，後樓作辦公室，亭子間和廂房是課堂，天井裏上操，剩下的晒台還可出租。校長由自己担任，會計主任由太太兼（利權不可外溢），庶務主任是小舅，訓導主任是自己兄弟。另外用上一個茶役，請上幾個剛出學校或尙未畢業的女教員，人事方面便已完備了。學生當然由外招來，但訂有優待辦法，介紹一人同來者，减費若干，二人三人……以此類推。管教不妨稍寬，成績不佳者，課後祗需另外付費補習。但每日淸掃教室的工作，必須由學生担任，以養成勞動的習慣（實在一個茶役亦忙不過來。）學生吃零食不妨，學校附設有合作社出售，課本練習簿，不准在外購買，以便劃一整齊。這種弄堂小學，便是學店的典型。</p>
<p>有一種補習學校，開了許多課程、選擇一課，動輒需費數萬元之鉅。對外的口號，美其名是招收失學學生。居然在無綫電台上，排起特別節目來。電影院裏，更多的是幻燈廣告。這種招徠學生的方法，與一般市儈那副推銷商品的窮兇極相，差不了少多。但據說；因而被誘引上鈎的學生可眞不少。可是，付了大筆的學費後，上了一兩課，覺得並不如當初廣吿上所說得那麼「引人入勝」。結果，都一一引退。於是，「學店」老闆預期的目的是可以達到了。</p>
<p>學費支配</p>
<p>記得教育部好像有過這樣的規定，學校以學費收入的百分之七十，作爲教職員薪津，百分之三十作爲校內其他開支。我們姑且就拿這個標準來解釋今日「學店」的營業狀况！</p>
<p>假定開學時學費收入共有一百萬，聰明的學店老闆就會精明的加以利用。或以高利貸借出，或用以投機運用。教職員的薪水到每月月底纔發，甚至於一再拖欠。校長利用每月的利息便足够支付教職員的薪津。至於說百分之卅的學校開支，房租比戰前漲了沒有多少倍，粉筆墨水等消耗，可由合作社的所賺相抵。戰前學校到夏天都供給茶水，如今看到那些小學生都自己帶瓶盛水，就可見一部份學校連這一項支出，竟亦節省下來了。</p>
<p>這樣一算，開學時老闆共收入一百萬，到學期結束時，亦許還是一百萬，分文未少！假使投機得法，或者還可倍上幾倍。</p>
<p>然而，倒霉的老闆亦有，像以前北京路的××中小學，因爲做股票投機失敗，虧蝕得連教職員的薪水都發不出，亦就大爲可悲了．</p>
<p>苦了教員</p>
<p>「學店」肥了的是老闆，苦的是教職員。她們一天忙到晚，又天天有那麼高高一疊的課卷要等着批改。然而每月所得，還不够維持個人的生活，好在學校看準她們的弱點，專用一些年輕低價有家庭負擔或師資不合格的女教員。雖然這樣，爲了飯碗，這些可憐的教職員還不得不巴結巴結上司。像本市西門路某中小學的教職員，逢到過年過節，都得向事務主任（校長太太）送禮，否則，老闆亦許將會對你不客氣了！</p>
<p>在上海，一部份學校開學時的學費都托銀行代收。這之簡，亦有着一個相互利用的條件在。銀行可即刻動用這筆筆鉅教，然而必須答應學校可以向銀行透支。這對於某些學店老闆亦是個莫大的方便。</p>
<p>嚴加撻伐</p>
<p>可是，話得說回來，學店的產生，自有其客觀的環境。上海學齡兒童衆多，市立和一些成績佳良的私立學校容納不下這許多人。因此，儘管你一所所的「學店」開張出來，不愁沒主顧跑上門來。所以要消滅「學店」這個名詞，一方面同需使幹教育工作者，認淸本身神聖至高的使命，在政府當局方面，亦應對各私立學校，嚴予督導使之改進，另外再多多設立國民學校，以安插學齡兒童。</p>
<p>當然，教育管教育，商業管商業，身爲學校校長而另外經營事業亦未可厚非，我們不但假如視學校像商店，專以賺錢爲目的，我們祗能說它是「學店」，而要毫不恂情，加以最嚴厲的撻伐！</p>

<h3>學校調查　供各級教育者研究資料　為兒女選擇學校的參考　為莘莘學生作升學津筏</h3>
<p>我們都知道上海有很多很多的學校，但是究竟總數有多少？其中市立的多少？私立的多少？那幾校歷史比較悠久，設備比較完善？戰有幾個校，戰後增加了還是减少了？學生人數的比較如何？……這許多問題，也許是平日關心教育的人所願意知道而一時難以調查的，記者特地收集了各方面的資料，作了個比較詳細的統計，承教育局統計科長施翀鵬鼎力相助，完成了下列的表格，假如這可以當作硏究教育者的一部分資料，家長爲子女選擇學校時的一種參考，同學升学的津筏，那是記者已引爲無上的安慰了。</p>
<p>照上面統計的數字，我們可以知道戰後增辦的學校，差不多有戰前的一倍，而學生的數目也增加了一倍光景。至造成這種現象的最主要的原因自然是因為戰時人口集中於上海的緣故。學校大多設備不完全，因爲校舍的狹小，學校大多實行半日制，上午中學，下午小學，自然難免有許多弊端，聽說教育當局已加以禁消，但是這是整個的社會問題，在房荒不能解決以前，半日制是難以廢除的。</p>
<p>這次戰爭中，校舍被毁，損失最大的如務本女中，敬業中學，愛國女中，啓秀女中等差不多什麼東西都沒有搬出來，現在的得以復校，中間的確不知道經過了多少的困難。這些辛勤工作者唯一的安慰就是復校的工作還比較順利，學生的人數有增無减，而且其中的學生差不多都是舊的多，因爲多數的人總是保守的，對於某一學校有了信仰之後，的確不再願意隨便轉學。</p>
<h3>公私立學校嚆矢　哪幾個學校歷史最悠久</h3>
<p>上海，畢竟是個文化中心，單就公私立專科，中等和初等三種學校，就有一千零五十所左右。這許多學校中倒底那幾隻是最早創辦的呢？記者在這裏可以向讀者作一個簡賅的報吿。</p>
<p>公立學校</p>
<p>（一）公立大學最早創辦的可算是國立交通大學——交大最初爲南洋公學，清光緒二十二年盛宣懷創辦奏准由招商、電報兩局年發經費，後來一共調過八次名字，到民國十七年冬才改名交通大學。</p>
<p>（二）中學最早創辦的是上海廣方言館，在同治二年（民元前四十九年）由江蘇巡撫李鴻章奏准設立，以學習外國語文爲目的。人學係選附近年在十四以下之優秀兒童，課程除外國語文外，兼課經史小學。時館址在老學前，至光緒三十一年陸軍部定名爲兵工專門學堂。</p>
<p>（三）市立小學創設最早是在淸光緒二十八年，同時設立的有三所：梅溪書院改設梅溪小學，敬業亦由敬業畫院改設敬業學堂，養正學堂亦同時成立。</p>
<p>（四）師範學校最早創辦的為南洋公學所設之師範院，創設於光緒二十三年。</p>
<p>私立學校</p>
<p>（一）大學中最早的是聖約翰大學。在淸道光二十五年（公元一八四五年（美國聖公會在上海創立學校，後改名爲約翰書院，至光緒末年才改為大學。</p>
<p>（二）中學以徐匯公學，清心中學爲最早。</p>
<p>（三）小學亦以徐匯公學中學附設的小學為最早。</p>
<p>（四）私人設校培植師資之所，最早的有項文瑞等所辦的師範傳習所，約設在光緒三十年。</p>
<h3>實用知識之門　技術訓練機構　補習學校</h3>
<p>談到上海的職業補習學校，比較歷史悠久的，可說是中華職業教育社附設的中華職業補習學校了。此校戰前曾有分校七處，現在僅存三校。這種補習學校的宗旨，就是教授實用智識技能，並訓練服務道德，增進就業效能。所以在他們的編制上，是處處替學者設想。因此分成晨班，日班，夜班，讓學者自已選擇空餘的時間和所課門，決定後，再由學校當局，編入相當級次。</p>
<p>納費</p>
<p>至於納費，則依科目單位及等級為依據。另加收少數雜費，上學期每科為二等中五百元，高級爲二千七百元，下學期起聽說將依照教育局的規定予以調整了。</p>
<p>科目</p>
<p>目前的科目有升學準備科，商科，婦女補習班，華英文打字科，營造工程專科，中文速記科，成人識字班等，其中成人識字班係專爲目不識丁或略識字者所設，只要自備書籍講義，付一筆雜費，一切都是免費的。</p>
<p>師生</p>
<p>據說三十五年春季班學生數以第一校來說，約有一千多，平均每一學生選擇三科，因此所有的七隻教室，從上午七時十分起到下午九時廿分止，就沒有一刻休息，</p>
<p>教職員共有三十五位，他們每天都是在極度的忙碌和緊張下生活着，然而所得的酬報，是每小時七百元，如果每天有八小時的課，一個月也祗十六萬八千元，事實上，接連八小時，一個人的精力，是絕對不可能的，何况還有許多課卷要改呢！所以今日的教師待遇，實在是最菲薄的了。</p>
<p>希望</p>
<p>這裏記者除希望學校當局能在全部學雜費收入中，以合理的比例，對淸苦的教職員予以足堪溫飽之薪津，並希望教育當局也能給予一部份的津貼，使一般眞爲教育而教育的，不致灰心改業；同時並希望政府能注意到這種補習學校的重要，今後在全國各地，多予設立，以救濟一般已有職業而尙有志深造的靑年，讓他們有個機會，繼續努力求學。</p>
<h3>顧教育局長視察　十六區中心國校</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市教育局顧局長李副局長，連日視察全市各校，指示改進各節，業誌本報。茲聞兩局長前日又至虹口第十六區中心國民學校視察，達二小時，對於該校復校工作，甚表滿意，並指示下學期添級辦法，甚爲詳盡云。</p>
<p>教育在我國向稱落後，上海因爲是都市，就比較不同些。可是大部分家庭裏還不把子女的教育費當作一筆必要的支出。一個朋友說他幼年讀書的故事。爲了要買一支鉛筆，他問他的母親要三個銅元，結果他得到的不是錢，是一頓責罵。大部分的父母都如此，他們把孩子們的學費當作一筆不必要的重負，尤其是，如果化在女孩子身上。</p>
<p>勝利之後，這種現象並沒有改變，主要是：生活仍壓迫得做父母的透不過氣來。一個普通家庭裏如果有三個求學的孩子，他們的父母便不勝負担。這學期已經結束，二個月暑假之後，便是新的學期開始，有多少做父母的開始爲他們子女下學期的學費而着急了！</p>
<p>學期開始的二個月前定學費的數目，原是一件難事，不過哦們不妨先將過去學期的學費數目作一檢討。當時的各私立大學及教會大學原定四萬五千元，獨有聖約翰大學定七萬五千元，分四萬五與三萬兩期付。七萬五千元在半年前是一個相當大的數目，不過在第二期付費時，好像覺得三萬元的數目並不大，別的大學爲了物價飛漲的關係，也紛紛加收了。那時的大學學費大概是五萬至八萬之間。</p>
<p>一般私立中學也分兩次付費。高中是第一次學費一萬二千元，雜費四千元；初中是第一次學費九千元，雜費三千元，並規定第二次收費不得超過第一次。不過那只是一般的例子，就記者所知，有數家比較貴族化的中學收費頗高，如育英，徐匯，金科，培成等高中都在四萬左右，初中都在三萬五千左右。</p>
<h3>學費檢討</h3>
<p>普通　私立小學分兩次付費，第一次約學費六千元，雜費二千元，規定第二次不得超過第一次，不過也有收費在二萬左右的。下學期學費呢？雖然尙未規定，聽說已有一個「大概的數目」。教會大學約在三十萬左右，中學約在最高二十二萬最低六七萬之間，小學約在最高十萬，最低二三萬之間。我們是否要對這數目加以非議呢？問題是在不安定的物價，二月之後的學校當局對於學費的數目，又是另一種看法了。學費，大學約在四十元至六十元之間，中學約在二十五元至四十元之間，小學約十元至十五元之間。如果以米價比例計算，上面所載的「大概的數量數目」也不好算多，不過教育及學校當局請不要忽略了下列幾種現象：一·前經濟情勢並不安定，不能與戰前相提並論；戰前的學校有更完美的設備。如教育法和教員，現在的學校，無論在設備與師資上，都免不了因陋就簡；三·戰爭造成大富與赤貧，富與窮的程度差別太大；這裏的意思是戰後的窮人較戰前爲多，多數人更難負担學費；四·教員的待遇，根本較戰前爲差；五·學校當局的各種支出開銷均較戰前爲省；六·現在大部份學校仍採半日上課制。</p>
<p>我們並不想在這裏規定一個自命爲公正的學費數目，不過照上列六點看來，學校當局是決不能以米價或無論什麼作標準來度量戰前和戰後的學費數目的，我們的意思是，爲了救中國的教育和學生，上面的「大概的數目」當然是太大了些。</p>

<h3>國家體面</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>下面這個故事，讀者們別將它當做神話看。</p>
<p>爲了德僑撤退問題，合眾社的倫德爾和外交部駐遞辦事處主任陳國廉發生了糾紛，因這糾紛，外交部駐遞辦事處引起了我們對於它的注意　　。</p>
<p>它是一個怎樣的機關呢？內幕情形如何呢？</p>
<p>從主任起，它現在又卅個員工，它的經費每月廿八萬元。而它是代表外交部的，上海這個地方，幾乎每天都有人來人往，廿八萬元，據說連電話費的支出都不夠。</p>
<p>辦事處成立以來，請過兩次客，一次在國際飯店，十四樓舉行的雞尾酒會，招待各國駐滬使領人員和上海各界，那筆賬即近大半年經費，至今還未核銷，暫記簿上掛著；另一次是暹邏代表國抵滬，外交部數次來電囑妥為招待，於是在新生活俱樂部請了兩桌，共計卅萬元，報了三次賬，都退下來，最後一次囑在賬單上請陪的客人簽字證明，因為暹邏代表團全體團員僅七人，為何要請兩桌客，所以陪客一定要簽字證明。</p>
<p>同人的伙食費常常須費躊躇，所好者，還有一筆護照簽證費的收入，今天簽了三張，有一萬五千元，買小菜錢有了，明天簽了四張，有兩萬元收入，伙食費也就因之也不成問題。</p>
<p>主任不敢出門，不敢應酬，一則衣冠欠漂亮，（禮服當然沒有了）二則那部老爺汽車，常常中途拋錨，三則沒有錢還請人家，不能一直喫人家的。</p>
<p>這就是外交部駐滬辦事處，這是千分之千的事實。</p>
<p>「外交人員」這四個字，平常我們聽到時，腦中將發生怎樣的聯想？當你讀完上面的簡略報導後呢？上海法院裏的朋友對這個辦事處的人說：「以窮來說，你們第一，我們第二，我們比你們略勝一籌！」</p>
<p>宋院長昨天在記者招待會上說：在目前高物價生活程度的煎熬下，最良善的一等人是發牢騷。這個辦事處的人於是都在發牢騷，但是他們的牢騷為：「請保全國家體面！」</p>
<h3>我怕醫生</h3>
<p>— 儲蘭天</p>
<p>我很憧憬醫生的職業；然而我很怕他們。</p>
<p>醫生的分佈式很不平均的，一般小市鎮上，大概都是買藥帶行醫，雖然有著固定住址，還不脫「郎中」意味。至於廣大的農村裏面，行醫的就寥若晨星了。而這種職業在都市裏面卻顯得特別發達，至於上海，仿佛已超過了飽和狀態，我們可以從一年登到頭的醫生廣告猜到這種情形的。</p>
<p>鄉下醫生除了世傳，儒醫，裝滿了一肚皮「金匱」「傷寒」的老頭們意外，新興速成的也很多，他們大都以醫為副業，所謂「丟下耙兒無掃帚」的萬能家。內外婦幼，一應具來，還有針法－注射。談到注射，我告訴你一件事；某醫生替病家注射靜脈，必先燒黃元三份，以視大功告成。你必以為怪吧？否否，在窮鄉僻壤，還有一種抽籤式的醫病法呢！一人抄各種藥方於一帳簿上，看病的人來了，則隨便翻出一頁，作為醫方。這種滑稽突梯的人為仙法治病，還流行在我們的世間！</p>
<p>我大妹妹墓上的小植物　　比我的臂膀粗了，但我對她的　，仍不能不怪我們那鄉下的大夫。她的病來得很遲绥，前後約有一個月光景，是一種水漲病，在醫學上或許不是絕症，但因為戰爭未平，交通間阻，結果就祗好吃了幾十帖苦水而終於死去。最可憐的是她最後瞑目的時候，還有一位大夫替她送行！這位老先生沒有診斷出病家的迅速死亡，他目舉他的藥物試驗者嗚呼哀哉！</p>
<p>都市的醫生是非常進步的了，他們有學理的根據，科學的手術。國醫界自然也沒有那些傳奇的怪事，不乏名手。不但如此，且有許多集體治療的規模宏大的醫院。照理在都市生病該是幸福的了？然而不然！</p>
<p>個把月前，母親在午夜以後忽然肚疼腹瀉，很像霍亂，但那時馬路固然戒嚴，醫生正在睡覺，醫院也不肯開門。不得已，祗好吃些人丹十滴水之類的東西。挨到天明，趕緊雇車送上醫院、緊急掛號，等到八時，才由我抱進內科診室，放上病床。那醫生看了掛號單，就問我：</p>
<p>「她是什麽病？」</p>
<p>我約略說了病況，他才起身在我母親的腹部上，用手按了幾下，以不到一分鐘的時間按了左右的脈搏。診斷就算完結。我問了他是不是霍亂？他答道：「唔－」他又答道：「唔－」便又做下去寫他的方子。並且吩咐我說：「拿去配藥，吃下去再看，倘若是時疫，必定要住院！」天哪，我怎麼知道是不是時疫呢？他就是那麼「唔」了兩下子。後面又繼續進來了病人，我祗好把母親再抱了出來。爲了慎重，把母親安頓在走廊里木質的座椅上。我打算辦住院手續。誰知道三等已滿，二等必須先繳三十萬元，並且還要找保；這把我一股勇氣全部擋回。謝謝天地，忙了半天，母親的肚皮卻止了疼，也止了瀉。「回去吧！蘭兒，回去茶水還方便些！」我又抱了母親，喊了車子回家。</p>
<p>真的，仿佛奇跡似的，才經了那大夫的一觸；祗在那病床上躺了幾分鐘，沒有吃什麽藥，病就好了。其神奇真不下於宋朝的大藥缸「西市引子」，神奇到喝了染缸水，也會治好病。</p>
<p>修養了兩三天，母親漸漸好了，也不覺感慨係之「假如我等那大夫來治我的病，怕已到了望鄉台了吧？」</p>
<p>這就是我無論在鄉下，在上海，甚至於無論在什麽地方，都怕了醫生的原故。</p>
<h3>蜘蛛</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>全世界的小生物中，要算蜘蛛最被人類誤解和誹謗了。蒼蠅和蚊子可怕得多，但女人見到牠們，不過感到一點討厭而已；看見了蜘蛛，卻要尖叫起來。當然，「黑寡婦」（蜘蛛中的一種）給牠的同類招來了惡名，然而即使是牠，也不如圖畫中那樣地黑呀！</p>
<p>事實上，蜘蛛可以說是人類的朋友，多少世紀以來，牠向昆蟲宣戰，保衛人類，抵禦昆蟲的全面進攻。蛛網所捕獲的蟲子，有許多事散佈瘟疫，破壞農作物的害蟲。但，蜘蛛所得到的報償是什麽呢？迫害！</p>
<p>蜘蛛除了對人類有卓越的貢獻之外，還有偉大的天才。牠所結的網，，有無數的用途，牠用來造橋，用來傳達消息，用來做公路。牠結了一個網之後，會用單絲構了一架橋，通到一個隱秘的戰略要地――在那裡牠還有一個家，蜘蛛像漁人一樣，耐心地等待著蟲子來自投羅網。</p>
<p>蜘蛛的種類極多，所結的網，也各有巧妙不同。橘黃蜘蛛，所結的網迂迴曲折。草蜘蛛結的網，如隧道形，底下有一個救命路，緊急時，可以逃之夭夭。白殼蜘蛛，能夠自由變黃，又由黃變白。陷阱蜘蛛，掘地為穴，上面以蛛絲結成門，需要一磅的拉力，纔能夠拉得開這扇蛛門，淡水蜘蛛，呼吸空氣，但卻生活在水中。</p>
<p>所以，請記住，應該以一種仁慈，尊敬的態度，對待牠；牠是一種能夠節儉的小動物。更是人類對抗有害昆蟲之戰中的偉大盟友！</p>

<p>王：對不起，請你延長幾天好不好？</p>
<p>張：不行，你那天說好的，明明叫我今天到我這兒來取的，你又什麽理由要延期呢？是你允了我的呀！</p>
<p>王：真對不起，停戰令延長八天了，難道咱們這點小事，就不能延長幾天嗎？老張！對不起你！</p>

<h3>「美國也有臭蟲」</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>啤酒，在美國雜誌上登的廣告，每標以「適度飲料」的字樣。但現在，卻成了，美國黑市交易中重要的物品，其所處地位，正和肉食，奶油及其他不足供應的物品相同。自美政府明令後製造啤酒的商人，已依令減少所用殼物的成份，然而黑市並不因質的減低而清淡，相反地，公共場所及夜總會，不惜出以廿元的代價，買半桶重量啤酒，而在合法的市場上，祗要九元就可以購買到了。但公共場所在旁晚時節開始做夜生意時，啤酒的黑市也跟著開頭，時間比合法的配給為早，否則要減少主顧。而穩定貨價的當局，對此竟也無法撲滅，因為配給啤酒雖限令個人親自去購，而分配的人，每忽視購買的人拿去作公用或私用。</p>
<p>在美國，肉食的黑市，更見猖獗。芝加哥市屠宰業的中心，肉的黑市也甚於各地。那邊的每日新聞，曾指出火酒的黑市買賣，到了今日，比起肉的黑市來，已等如一粒花生米大。肉的黑市，一種方法，就在由賣著以超過官定的價格，賣給照配給卡上指定分量要多些的人。包裝的時候，卻包得特別小，使人看了一位裏面的肉，沒有超過官定分量。紐約的肉商，已看到今年夏季，主婦們將來除了向黑市購買外，買不到肉類，其情況要比戰爭時期更壞。光就紐約市內，目前所有肉食，百分之九十購自黑市。而主婦們買肉之時，付了錢，更不敢問分量多少，若干錢一磅，怕警察看見了不准購買而沒有肉吃。大屠戶在指責小屠戶的數字太多，譬如紐約市內，本年三月某天，大屠戶所宰的豬牛為八千九百三十六頭，而小屠戶也宰了七千一百三十七頭。小屠戶的肉，當然多數做黑市買賣。所以情形如果不好轉，不久的將來，所有肉食，要全部在黑市出賣了。</p>
<p>除了啤酒與肉類，其他食物，亦莫不有黑市。譬如紐約的火腿，官價每磅四角，黑市要八角五分或九角。克利夫蘭的牛肉，官價每磅五角三分，而黑市要七角。波士頓有一個的商人，買進的奶油每磅七角五分，賣出要一元，過去幾月，發了不少大財。有許多不需要的蔬菜，商人要搭了賣，其中以馬鈴薯為多。紐約有一位主婦，因為要買一磅洋蔥，結果多賣了些馬鈴薯與番茄。費城的居民，每天至少有五十磅食糖，向黑市買來，官價是每磅七分，黑市要二角到二角五分。無疑，配給的食物，其中有一部份被走私，在黑市上出賣呢！</p>
<h3>自卑與自大</h3>
<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>「心理的複合體」在作崇桂庭</p>
<p>自卑與自大本來是很正常的，但是有時不應該自卑而下意識地自卑起來，或者不應該自大而下意識地自大起來。這才是畸形的心理狀態。也就是心理學上所謂「心理的複合體」（Psychological　Complex）在那裡作崇的結果呢。</p>
<p>「心理的複合體」是潛隱於下意識裏面的一種特殊心理狀態。根據最進步的心理分析學（Psycho-Analysis）的解釋，此種畸形心理狀態的形成是與個人的幼年生活有關的，尤其是關於性的一方面（著名心理學家福萊特Freud便是這樣主張）。這些狀態的種類繁多，除了自卑感（Inferiority　Complex）與優越感(Superiority　Complex)之外，還有自卑與優越的混合感，迫害感，犯罪感，憎恨的轉嫁感等等。</p>
<p>自卑感是普通一般人，尤其是神經衰弱的青年，所最容易犯的毛病。他們在任何場合，特別是遭遇著緊張的場面或者在大庭廣眾之中，總覺得面紅耳熱，局促不安。有時想講一些說話，但呐呐然又不能出諸口；有時連手也不聽指揮，自動地彈起琵琶來。那時候，真正恨不得地下有一個窟窿可以立即遁入裏面去。患著自卑感的人，診室可憐的，他無論如何總覺得處處都不如人。這種心理對於他的事業發展當然會發生嚴重的影響的。</p>
<p>近年來的心理分析學有著長足的進步並且已經發現了糾正自卑感的方法。巴黎緹蘭大學某心理學教授所著的一本書叫做「人的磁力」（Personal　Magnetism）,其中便列舉了一些簡單的治療法。最普通的一種是指導病者如何增強其本人的「磁力」，每晨面對著鏡子，向自己的影子反復地用強力的語氣講述以下的句子：「我是你的主宰」，「我無論什麽時候都比你強」，「我命令你這樣做，你必須服從我」。……久而久之，便能增強個人的自信心並且克服了自卑感。看起來，這樣做法似乎像開玩笑的。可是試驗的結果卻也有異想不到的效力。</p>
<p>優越感的最顯明的例證是希特拉的自大狂。這種自大的瘋狂心理使他自己催眠起來，於是他的一切言語舉動都由自己催眠的力量支配著。所以，他一走到講臺上，便滔滔不絕地嚷叫著，指手畫腳地表演。那時候，他居然會舉得他自己便是德國，是整個亞里安民族，甚至於是控制全宇宙的上帝。這樣的自大狂可算是發展到最高峯了，結果毀滅了自己，也毀滅了德國。這的確是最高危險而最難治療的病症！</p>
<p>另外還有一種人，本來自己是有著自卑感的，真因為這樣，他拼命用種種的辦法來掩飾自己的弱點，而另一方面，幹著損人利己的甚至於不利己的行為。其病深者可能演成犯罪。像殺人放火的匪徒和詐欺犯取財的騙子多數是屬於這一類的。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰發生後，根據美國心理分析學家的調查，發現了不少或深或淺的精神錯亂的例證。信不信由你，在此次戰爭期中，就有八十五萬名兵士爲了精神錯亂而須送院療治的，而平民甚於同等原因而引起糾紛者亦不在少數。此種例證大致可以分為迫害感，犯罪感及憎恨的轉嫁感數種。這些畸形心理所以形成的原因大致是：</p>
<p>（一）房荒問題使許多人覺得精神上非常不安，時常會肝火打動，暴跳如雷；</p>
<p>（二）非常時期休假的取消招致了極度疲乏和緊張；</p>
<p>（三）戰爭的進行增加了人對人的憎惡；</p>
<p>（四）父母對於兒童的管束因戰爭而鬆弛，以致養成下一輩野蠻行為的習慣；</p>
<p>（五）在戰場上殺了人，良心上受著責備，於是總覺得自己犯了罪而無從洗脫；</p>
<p>（六）在戰場期中發生的種種不幸事件使本人的憎恨無從發洩，而致轉嫁於他人。</p>
<p>所以，「心理的複合體」的問題在近代醫學界上犯罪學上佔著極其重要的地位。在美國，精神治療專家總共就有三千五百多名之多。至於我國呢，聽說從前北平協和醫院曾經開設過這一科，成績如何則不甚清楚。然而我們仍然算是不幸中之大幸，因為我們還有張天師和西藏喇嘛之類的國粹精神治療專家來替我們爭些面子呢。</p>
<h3>奶粉和麵粉的謎</h3>
<p>— 晏安</p>
<p>日前聽得一個朋友說：吃了免費配合的奶粉，會腹瀉。我有點不相信，因為奶粉調得不和，或者永不沸，有時可能有這種現象。何況奶粉是從美國來的，質地一定不差，最近，兒子的學校裏面也配給了二磅奶粉，我特別謹慎從事，非特調得很和，並且還放在鍋子裏面燒沸。爲了恐防吃壞孩子，由我先嘗，吃的時候，有一層極細的白物沉澱下去的，面上好像一層清水。更奇怪的是，在先調和的時候，好像發酵，會得多起來。吃在口裡，可以辯出未能溶解的麵粉子，味道也不像我們平常吃的克寧奶粉。這到底是什麽東西？難道美國人會欺騙我們嗎？這到底是什麽一回事？行，總能夠告訴我們么？</p>
<p>一個星期之前，甲長來說：每戶有麵粉可領。在這種米珠薪桂的時代，聽說有麵粉，如獲至寶，多麼興奮！隔了一天，已預備好麵粉袋，到甲長那裡去。甲長說：「這事是由保長叫我通知你們的，可是麵粉不歸我發給，請去問保長。」當就趕到保長那裡，保長做夢也沒有想到有這麼一回事的樣子。他有點兒愕然。少頃，才回答說：「既然甲長來通知你，你去問甲長罷！」我祗得默默地收拾了空袋，在酷烈的太陽底下走回來。默默地，因為我在這八年中，處在淪陷區裏面，養成了奴性，現在雖然已經靠了人家的幫助，總算勝利了，可是我的奴性仍未解放。見了現在的保長，亦不敢多說話。不過，我總不明白，假使並無其事，何必多此一舉，特地來通知呢？</p>
<p>實在，大中華民國的怪事太多了，非小市民能所明瞭的！</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（一）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦娟</p>
<p>鳳：</p>
<p>你離開了我，已足足有一個月了；這一個月中，我好像失魂落魄似的，只是茫茫然，不知道如何使好，鎮天的獨個兒在園子裏旁皇著，但見一處處花木扶疏，臨風搖曳，卻偏偏瞧不見你那瘦怯怯的身影；我又直著嗓子高喊你的名字；但聽得好鳥枝頭，鳴聲上下，卻偏偏聽不到你那銀鈴般清朗的應聲。呀！你到底上那兒去了啊？上哪兒去了啊？</p>
<p>回想我們結婚了二十九年，從沒有分離得這麼久的；前人詩有「枕邊細數團圓夜，除卻離家總並頭」之句，我們也正是如此，何況我從不出門遠行，老是和你廝守在一起，所謂離家也者，只是某一年和陳定山伉儷途筑巢複製同遊黃山，去了十天，你沒有同去，可是這十天中，彼此已記掛得什麽似的。到得抗戰期間，我們一家從安徽回到了上海，每年春秋兩季，我總得獨自回蘇州來探望這殘破的家園；於是彼此又有短時間的分離，少則三四天，多則七八天；還有一次，那時在七十六號惡魔們猖獗時期，和我們同住在相莊的申報王經理被架去了，馬經理星夜把汽車接我住到報館裏面去，一連住了十天，使你也提心弔膽了十天；除此以外，簡直全是「團員夜」「總並頭」的了，誰知道這回子你竟然悄悄地離開了我，離開了我足足一個月還不見你回來，撇得我形單影隻，望眼欲穿！呀！你到底上那兒去了啊？上哪兒去了啊？</p>
<p>等到我旁皇得筋疲力盡，回到那木棚子的臨時客堂裏面去的時候，一眼望見了那一白如雪的靈臺，白的蠟燭，白的燈籠，白的桌圍，白的挽聯；更望見了你的神主，你的遺像；我淚腺哇的一聲哭了出來，我知道，知道你已死去了，你已到了別一世界中去，再也不會回來的了！唉！記得你在病中，曾握著我的手，含著眼淚，很懇切的對我說：「爺，我少不了你，你也少不了我！」言猶在耳，而你卻硬著心腸，撒手長逝去了。我固然少不了你，永永的少不了你，難道你已少的了我，這纔撇下我頭也不回的走了麼？</p>
<p>說起你的身體，雖然並不怎樣的壯健，可是也從來沒有害過大病，從來沒有進過醫院；不過年年夏季鬧痊夏，身上有些兒發熱，胃口不開，食量因此減少，然而一到秋季，也就復原了。誰知去年痊夏特別提早，仍是往年的那種徵象，你也並不在意，天天照常的黎明即起，照常的操作德很忙碌，雖也吃些國藥，不見大效，勸你節勞休養，你又不肯聽，說痊夏是常年老例，一過了夏季就會好的。大理石這次的痊夏又特別延長，直到中秋以後，熱度方始退盡，胃口也漸漸地開了，不過，消瘦依然，未見恢復，勸你延醫服藥，你為了顧到我的經濟，婉辭拒絕，說只要吃得下飯，自然會胖起來的。到了農曆十二月下旬，我回蘇州一行；你卻忙著過年的種種工作，磨粉咧，蒸年糕咧，大掃除咧，一連忙了好幾天，就把你累到了。到得我回上海時，你已病倒在牀，服了國藥，熱度仍是不退。錚兒著了慌，忙去請了他的好友程祖麟西醫師來，給你一檢查身體，說是肺部有問題，非照愛克司光不可，於是第二天我硬要你去照，喚玲兒伴著你上肺病療養院去，你強而後可，還是不相信自己有肺病；因為你有時受了涼雖要咳嗽，但是從沒有吐過血。隔一天錚兒把愛克司光照片取回來了，卻把我嚇了一跳，原來照片上顯示出你的左右兩肺尖都有些黑影，證實了你所害的竟是那最可咒詛的肺病。程醫師安慰我，說中年人害這病，不比年輕的來得嚴重，只要好好地攝生療養，儘有霍然而愈的希望。他先開了些退熱藥和開胃藥，喚你日服三次；隨後又買了維他命Ｂ為他命C和鈣針，一共六十多針，預備回蘇注射，因為我們早已決定在元宵節後遷回蘇州故園來了。</p>
<h3>女子思春期的性教育</h3>
<p>— 延娟</p>
<p>（一）月經期間</p>
<p>女子到了思春期以後，性器發育完全，月經就來潮了。這段時間，做母親的最應注意的，就是要告訴她的女兒，如何處置以及注意衛生。</p>
<p>月經期的衛生，簡單的來說，就是要保持清潔，因為這個時候，性器充血，子宮的上皮的脫落，子宮裏面，就有小的創口，病菌很容易在月經血中繁殖，因此，局部的清潔實在非常重要。但最好外部洗淨，不要入浴。</p>
<p>同時，這時候，精神非常不安，如何使精神安靜，也很重要的。</p>
<p>（二）處女的性衛生</p>
<p>一般的父母，對於小孩的衛生，非常的注意；但對於一個到了思春期的女子，反而加以放任，這實在是不對的。其實，這一段時間內，在女子的一生中，身心上最易發生變化，所以應該比小孩子更要注意。</p>
<p>到了思春期的年齡，無論男女，都是不宜吃刺激性的食物，女子尤其要嚴禁。因為刺激性的東西，會使性欲亢奮，更會使生殖器充血，因此發生「自瀆」。</p>
<p>其次，要注意睡眠的時間，睡眠的時間和容貌，有著很深的關係，如果睡眠不足，面部就現出緊張的樣子，美貌就會得破壞。少女必須要有適當的睡眠，使精神愉快，而給肉體一種好的影響。一般年輕的女子，往往耽讀小說，深夜不寐，已是不妥，更有讀了小說以後，就寢後，描出種種空想，而使性慾亢奮，甚至於陷入「自瀆」的行為，這實在是很危險的事。</p>
<p>在處女期內，更有一件應該注意的事，是「同性戀愛」，那和「自瀆」一樣的有害，一旦陷入，就難脫除。</p>
<p>這種惡習慣的原因，不外乎惡友的感應，境遇的不良。工場裏面的女工，學校裡的女學生，同性戀愛是常有發生的事。思春期的處女，會無意識的要求一個伴侶，但要求異性對手，恐怕社會上有所批評，於是便同性相親起來，而陷入同性戀愛的地步。在這種場合，最好由母親和姊姊，和她開明直說，使她自拔，這是最好的方法。</p>
<p>（三）性器疾病</p>
<p>處女時代的性器疾病發生的原因，多是由於月經期中的攝生不良，或「自瀆」的關係，或者因先天的疾病，或者因體質的虛弱，也會發生疾病。</p>
<p>一般人以為女子的性器疾病，都是在結婚以後才發生的，這是錯誤的。而年輕的女子，由於上述的原因，有了性病以後，又怕羞請醫生診治，也是錯誤的。要知道，處女時代的此種疾病或者性器異常，對於將來的結婚生活，有極大的影響，兩親以及本身，非加注意不可。</p>
<p>總之，處女的性器衛生，最要緊的兩個字，是「清潔」，因為該部和泌尿器常是濕潤，如果不潔，便易引起陰門炎的病症，又因為葡萄狀菌容易附著在粘膜上繁殖，也會得發生炎症的。</p>
<h3>海濱沙灘或網球場上，此種髮式最為適宜，其垂於頸部的髮髻，有一種鄉村的純樸風趣，前面的頭髮向後梳刷，中間以髪帶束緊，如此即使在大風之中，以不致散亂。</h3>
<h3>假使你希望頭髮光澤有致，那末這種樣子是最合適的了。後髪向內捲曲，並依白色梳夾之力，將前面的頭髮保持一種柔和的波浪起伏。</h3>
<h3>訓練孩子</h3>
<p>— 晨星譯</p>
<p>大家一起玩木貨車</p>
<p>我有兩個兄弟，他們常常為了要爭著玩那輛木的小貨車，所以也常常發生爭吵，但是我的父親沒有能力再買一輛新的，使他們每人有一輛，這怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>於是在一天的晚上，父親說了：「你們常常爲了這輛車而吵架，現在我來規定，你們大家輪著一人玩一個心情，但是在那星期中，玩的人要將柴搬到廚房內裝滿那一個木柴箱，輪不著的人可以作他自己所喜歡的遊戲。」</p>
<p>起初，他們覺得這樣的規約十分公平，但是不久之後他們便發現在單獨工作遊戲時太寂寞了，於是他們重新一起玩，每天合力將柴搬到廚房內，從此以後他們不再為了這輛木的貨車而爭吵了。</p>
<p>這裏是夏夜之宮可用的一種髮式。頭頂盤起的小髮辮，有一種人工之美。髪的一彎彎垂至頭後，四朶花增加了嬌媚。這種髮式襯示出一種少女和貴婦的混合的風度。</p>
<h3>科學證明母愛偉大</h3>
<p>— 劉宗文</p>
<p>平常我們稱頌母愛偉大，往往祗有一個模糊的概念。</p>
<p>現在科學的進步，已經證明母愛的確是偉大的了。</p>
<p>美國全國心理衛生協會的布蘭女醫師說：嬰孩如果得到母親充分的撫愛，往往比較早會說話。</p>
<p>鮑德梅克博士研究犯罪少年的結果，證明每一個不能適應社會環境的兒童，都在幼時與父母缺乏美滿的關係。</p>
<p>紐約布里筏醫院試驗的結果，證明有母親或「代理母親」加以撫愛的病孩，他的病比較容易好。</p>
<p>美國海斯博士辦了一個育嬰堂，用科學的方法去試驗，結果證明有人愛撫的嬰孩容易長胖，不容易生病。</p>
<p>這些科學上的事實，都充分證明了母愛的需要和偉大。</p>
<h3>火爐架上的一隻盒</h3>
<p>我的一個朋友，他又八個孩子，於是常常遇到孩子問他要錢去買他們所需要的東西，而他亦常常得應付著。後來他想出一個規約，對孩子們說：「如果你們要買什麽東西，先向我講，我便會將所需要的錢放入那火爐架上的盒內，但是你們要在一個星期內不可以動他，如果過了一個星期之後，你覺得仍是那麼需要那東西，你可以再盒內將錢拿出去買那你所需要的東西，如果你對那東西的需要性因過了一星期的時間而低落了，你便將錢從盒內拿出來存入銀行之內。」</p>
<p>這一個條例，一直實行下去，從他們是小孩而變成大人，而他們的銀行存款亦隨著他們的歲數增大到一個相當可觀的數目，因此他們所購買的東西亦較為有價值了。</p>

<h3>雜劇三編與無錫曲家</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>「雜劇三編」是無錫人　氏金編纂的他自已是無錫人，因此所交遊的曲家也是無錫人為多。因此，這部書中的曲家有不少是無錫人，也有些是無附近的常州人。我們看上元周暉的「金陵鎖事」和江寧顧啟元的「客座　語」，知道其中所敘，大半都是南京曲家；現在也一樣，在無錫鄒氏金的「雜劇三編」裏，其中所收，也大半都是無錫曲家或無錫附近的常州曲家。</p>
<p>「雜劇三編」共三十四卷、每卷一劇。卷五是鄒兌金的「空堂話」無錫金匱縣志卷四十雜識記鄒兌金軼事一則雲：「鄒叔介兌金崇禎丁醜公車北上，渡江，泊舟金山，狂風大作。叔介見有復舟，招手疾呼，出金援救。眾操舟競渡，活十一人，獲死屍十九。復捐三百　。設救生船二十餘艘，號紅船，至今好善者踵行之。叔介賣資既罄，竟歸，不復赴試。子即殿撰忠倚。」按同書券三十九藝文志鄒忠倚著有「雪蕉集」。</p>
<p>卷二十九是孫源文的「餓方朔」。焦循劇說卷三雲：余嘗憾元人曲不及東方曼倩事，或有之而不傳也。明楊升庵有割肉遺細君一折，又茅孝若撰辟　　董　事，皆本正史演之。唯笨庵孫源文餓方朔四　以西王母為主宰，以司馬遷蔔式李陵終軍李夫人等串人，悲歌慷慨之氣，寓於俳諧戲幻之中，最為本色。無錫金匱縣志卷二十三忠節孫源文傳雲：「孫源文字南宮，繼皋幼子，諸生，有至性，善飲酒，好讀書。其學經史百家，無不畢覽。軀幹短小，吸取古衣冠。慷慨語天下事，或古今成敗，莫不窮其源流。崇禎十七年，聞京師陷，帝死社稷；源文行坐悲泣，無間晨夜。及秋賦聞雁詩曰：「少小江南住，不聞鳴雁哀。今宵清枕淚，知爾舊京來。」未幾咯血間　，淚盡而絕。乾隆四十一年賜入祀忠義祠。」又，同書卷三十九孫源文著有「晴天屐」和「笨庵集」。</p>
<p>孫源文的好朋友就是黃家舒。雜劇三編卷三十錄有黃家舒的「城南寺」。錫多識小錄（乾隆十七年序，黃　輯）卷十四聽社十七子條雲：「與幾社復社遙相應和，有合刻「十七子社稿」行於世。」在十七子姓氏中，黃漢臣家舒就是一個。無錫金匱縣志卷二十六雲：「黃家舒字漢臣。自少稱高才生，與孫源文善。甲申之變，源文殉節，家舒遂棄諸生服。坐臥鬥室，謝絕交遊，自名其集曰為文堂集以見志。知府宋之普聞其名、欲一致之，不可得。體贏，以病自廢。修靜業，無子。門人馬　刻其遣文，素松齡序之。」同書卷三十九藝文志著錄他的「焉文堂集」十卷和「南忠紀錄」。卷三十七錄有他的散文「歐陽林曾三公祠堂記」、中有句雲：「逆閹盜柄，三公與東林為始終。」卷三十三錄有他的詩過　子方故居雲：「擊築悲歌記昔時，鳥啼月落酒盈　。洋　悔西州路，虎黃空餘北海思。池館尚存書散盡，衣冠非故燕來遲。田光刎首荊卿死，寂寞西風哭漸離。」卷四十雜識雲：「黃漢臣與孫笨庵交善。笨庵死節，漢臣有與張秋紹書雲：「弟　與笨庵隔河而語，憂形於色。笨庵果以殉國死矣。北以孱軀，尚存人世，每食脫粟半盂，諒無久理。惟兄留心吾邑文獻，實有賴焉·家舒病中伏枕書。」</p>
<p>卷三十二是堵廷琴的「衛生符」。無錫金匱縣志卷十六選舉表順治二年的堵廷　，乃丁亥進士。又，卷三十九藝文志有他的「襟蘭集」。</p>
<p>券三十四是鄒氏金自已的「風流塚」。無錫金匱縣志卷十六選舉表天啟六年說他是庚辰進士。</p>
<p>卷二十七是薛旦的「昭君夢」。薛旦當然也是無錫人。武進陽湖縣志錄有富室薛旦，字號與行事均不類，當另為一人。</p>
<p>卷二十八是張龍文的「旗亭燕」。張龍文雖是常州人，無錫也是屬於常州人邑以內的。武進陽湖合志卷二十八雲：「張龍文字常麟，武進人，府學　生倜儻有奇氣。隱居季子墓旁。大兵往攻江蔭，經其地。龍文倡鄉民禦之，眾潰，龍文被斫死，遍體皆創，猶扶牆植立不僕。（陳志忠：義祠錄）</p>
<p>卷十七到二十是鄭無瑜的雜劇四種：「鸚鵡洲」「汩羅江」「黃鶴樓」和「騰王閣」。每劇首頁均署作「西神鄭瑜」，當為姓鄭名瑜，字西神。但王國維曲錄卻說他是西神人，他把鄭瑜的字當作籍貫了。按，西神山即　山，在無錫。因此有人說鄭瑜是無錫人，似不可靠。</p>
<p>因為雜劇三編的編者鄒式金是無錫人，所以他在集中所搜羅的曲家，如鄒兌金。孫源文·黃家舒·堵廷棻·薛旦和他自已六個人便都是無錫人。張龍文則是無錫附近的常州人。</p>
<p>此書所著錄的其他曲家，籍貫可考的有卷一二「通天臺」「臨春閣」的作者太倉吳偉業，卷三四「讀離騷」「　琵琶」的作者長洲尤侗，卷六至卷十一「蘇園翁」「秦廷築」「金門　」「醉新豐」「鬧門神」「雙合歡」的作者浙江歸安茅維，卷二十一「眼兒媚」的作者會稽孟稱舜，卷二十四「續西廂」的作者海寧查繼佐，卷三十一「西臺記」的作者長洲陸世廉。太倉和長洲都是無錫附近的地方。</p>
<p>籍貫不可考甚至有些連姓名也不知道的是卷十二到十六「半臂寒」「長公妹」「中郎女」「京兆眉」「翠鈿緣」的作者南山逸史，卷十七到二十的作者鄭瑜，卷二十三「孤鴻影」和「夢幻緣」的作者周如璧，卷二十五「不了緣」和作者碧蕉主人，卷二十六「櫻桃宴」的作者張來宗，卷三十三「鯁詩　」的作者土室道民。我猜想這裏面總還有個把無錫人，可惜已不能　鄒氏金而問之了。</p>
<h3>墓</h3>
<p>— 正岡子規著　陳家煜節譯</p>
<p>這樣活著實在一點也沒有意義，所以，要是可以死而復生，出門作一年左右的地獄旅行，正在週年祭的時候，悄然而活，就當眾來一個地獄內幕的演說，這該是多痛快的事。不過要是一上西天而就完蛋了，那可不能太教人感謝了。但說不感謝究竟是廢話，因為諸行無常，禍福不定，今晚上要是牛頭馬面駕了「有火的車」（日本民俗，死人由此種車接去。）來請你的時候，就非死不可了。實在朋友們約好了明兒晚上在「柳橋」（娟妓集中之處。）請吃花酒，不可以通融通融，延期一天嗎？想這麼請求，因為是鬼的關係，恐怕不一定就能答應你。不過俗語說：有錢能使鬼推磨，往他胸袋裏，塞上一包鈔票，或許鬼也就為你所屈了。偏偏的不湊巧，我身邊連一毛國幣都沒有。但沒有錢也得裝有錢哪，給鬼看出來沒有錢，可就要不得。</p>
<p>既是非死不可了，也得留下個遺囑。臨死而不留下一點紀念，讓人家聽見了，也總不成句話呀。</p>
<p>啊喲，隔壁房裏許多人在吵吵嚷嚷呢，好象是在說「病危」的電報要打呀還是不打之類的話。怎麼？耳朵邊好像有誰在說話：沒有什麼說了吧？唉，那能沒有話說呢，請給我設法借幾個錢好不好？就這句話嗎？不，我喜歡吃饅頭，希望上祭的時候多添些饅頭，來供奉我，拜託拜託。</p>
<p>怎麼這樣靜呀？教人怪難過的。有抹香（日本葬儀的習俗，屍體抹香。）的味兒了，這種香味，我活著的時候，從來就不喜歡，死了，還是不太喜歡。胸上有多少東西壓著不舒服，身體也就不自由了，這一定是在用石灰把我的身體給塞起來了。填塞棺材，其實應該預先告訴他們要用鮮花不要用石灰，早先忘記如今可沒有辦法了。</p>
<p>現在這是往墓地去了，從人腳和輪轉的聲音上估計，來送葬的人大概有百來個，要是登在報紙上，不用說一定是約三四百人。不過，在我區區這個！儀上講。百來個人已經不能算少了。</p>
<p>啊，真是道道地地到了心死的境界了。剛才到抬出棺材為止。還　得肖清楚楚，以後，　　上。棺材……給鐘鼓和各種曲調，攪得上了火，還微微聽見人們在說「真可惜木蓮居士死了」之類的話。那以後，就人事不省了。現在才聽見「咯嗒」一聲，看著看著，就埋進地下墳坑裏去了。真是寂靜而淒涼，完全和靜坐的那種味兒不同，千真萬確，地獄的空氣是死的。</p>
<p>啊，來了這麼多人！是誰？唔，仍舊是昨天那些人。啊，真太客氣太親切了。諸位累了罷，不怕疲倦，為了要看看墓墳是否已埋葬完滿，又到這裏來，實在太教人感動謝了。諸位也許看不見罷，可是我正在泥草之下，對諸位的商情厚誼感謝著呢。俗語說：去者日疎，可是偏偏諸位對我死者之禮，簡直是綿綿無盡期。按我生前的經驗，到朋友的墓地去憑吊，普通就只一次，去了一次以後，雖然老是想再去一次罷，可是終是沒有去成。我在地下祈祝諸君長命萬歲。</p>
<p>日子過的很快，從我死了以後，現在已經過了一週年了。朋友們捐款而為我修造的紀念塔，已經很美麗的修成了。四角方方的基石上，豎著一根大理石的圓柱，這有點太漂亮啦。為這個，朋友們真是煞費苦心，他們對死者這樣的厚情，實在令人可感。於是先幾天在墳地上遇見了兩個人，從他們的談話上看：紀念塔固然造好了，不過遣稿還沒有辦法出版，要在請朋友們捐助些，可是塔剛修好，這種話還不便說出口，明年週年的時候再說罷。這一篇話，真是不可靠，可是反過來想，遣稿縱使提早一年出版，也不見得有多高的名譽。只要明年能夠出版，可算已經不錯了。不過那些鬼要笑話我，我自已倒無所謂，總之，反正人已死了，功是可以斷定的。真的，運墳都不來上，遺稿之類的事，當然更無照應的功夫了。</p>
<p>隔鄰的貴族，大概對地獄住慣了，所以蚯蚓小便的味道還記得很清楚吧。在這裏，淒涼倒不太在乎，只是因為朋友都不來，對世事也就無從知悉，這倒是痛苦的。朋友們現在正做著什麼呢？不知道。藝妓小妾要是仍舊在自已也就沒有辦法，只有聽之而已。</p>
<p>唉，太寂寞了。近幾年來總在想：周年那一天也許會有人來吧，「七月七日」那一天也許會有人來吧，可是結果，一個人也沒有來。到這裏後，大概的算起來，已經有五年了。遺稿究竟如何也不知道，大概沒有出版或做著買賣生涯，此刻該已成為一個不大不小正合適的小老太太了吧，究竟嫁了人沒有？不知道。軍閥已經沒有了吧？不知道。元老們大部份都死了吧？我臨死的時候正是軍人全盛的時代，現在究竟是誰的時代了呢？也不知道。</p>
<p>喔，好涼呀！有點教人討厭的風吹　了。前幾天下過一場雨，有些地方崩潰了。蟋蟀的鳴聲聽著很近了。怎麼誰也不來修理修理。</p>
<p>誰來呢？晚上，一面吟詩，一百踱著方步，准是個書生。啊喲，在我墳前站住了，借著月光來讀我墓碑上的字。還用腳踢我的紀念塔，這真太無禮貌了。該變個鬼，鑽出去嚇嚇他。不過近來人心不古，貪欲心太大，他們如果知道這裏有鬼，硬是會把鬼捉來送淺草公園去陳列，收門票賺錢。所以還是安靜點兒不出去的好，這家夥一面念著詩，一面走了。</p>
<p>近來來到運地方的，簡直是個個有所為而來。昨天很希奇，忽來了一個戴眼鏡的書生，怎麼把我的紀念塔看了又看，原來因為有一家雜志，出了一個徵文題目，叫做「墓」，這間是為搜集材料而來。總之，如今是沒有白來的人了。偶而有無所謂而來的，閑得沒事做，就打打敲敲的把紀念塔破壞，弄的沒有方法收拾。</p>
<p>啊約，冷呀冷呀！如今是連冬天冷得起雞皮疙瘩的皮膚也沒有了，身上毫毛都禿光了，簡直是赤骨的情形了。啊喲，在我以為是最寒冷的月光，也很疎散的照上了枯骨。</p>
<h3>勝利戒指</h3>
<p>— 馮勤為</p>
<p>父親親自套在我左手無名指上的V字勝利戒指在閃閃發光。為了紀念抗戰勝利，他特地打了這只戒指給我。熱淚滿眶，我輕輕地撫著它，如同撫著父親瘦而血管突出的手背一樣。僅兩天和病魔痛苦的掙扎，父親終於給死神帶離了這污濁的世界。父親雖然和我們永別了，可是他底正直的精神和愛心永垂不朽，發出閃閃之光，和這勝利戒指一般。</p>
<p>是去年十二月裏的事了，抗戰結束還沒有多久，四海慶賀升平，家家父母，都期望著和他們的子女團聚。那時才得了中風症幾個月的父親，也是朝朝晚晚，熱烈地等待著他的兒子們回家。當我滿面塵埃，提了旅行袋，踏進了闊別五年的家門，緩步走近了父親的牀前，我看見了父親。他靜靜地坐在牀上抽紙煙。給生活的重擔和病魔煎迫得蒼老而軟弱的臉，更顯得慈祥可憐。當他特然發覺了我的到達，便費力地用左手撐了桌子慢慢立起身來，用不清楚的語調，呐呐的叫喚著我的名字，重複地一遍又一遍。快樂的眼淚潤濕了我的眼睛，也潤濕了我的心靈。我扶他坐了下來，他回過身去，用震顫的左手，在枕邊的小皮箱裏拿出這只早已預備好了的勝利戒指，給我套上，一邊興奮的對我說：「我真快樂啊，殘酷的戰爭不會再來了，我要永遠和你們在一起過著平安快樂的日子了。」可是父親還沒有達到他的願望，就這樣匆促的離開了我們。</p>
<p>這是多麼美麗和小巧的一只戒指啊，V字放在一朵梅花上面，戒指兩邊鑲著仙女的雙翅。它象徵勝利與和平，象徵世界上最可貴的東西——愛。</p>

<h3>Five-Person Talks in De Facto Stagnation, Overall Domestic Situation Increasingly Depressed; China Lodges Protest Against Convening of National Assembly; Zhou Enlai Meets with Marshall Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Five-Person Talks adjourned again today, and the political atmosphere in the capital was as dull as yesterday. According to a certain authoritative observer who told this reporter, the results of the Five-Person Talks failed to promote the resolution of pending issues, which was regretted by all parties. Therefore, there may be changes in the format of the talks. Based on various signs observed yesterday and today, a new format of talks is being brewed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the results of the Five-Person Talks on the evening of the 6th, in addition to Shao Lizi reporting to Chairman Chiang on the government side, the CCP side reported to Yan'an, but no response has been received. Before new instructions are received from both sides, the talks will naturally be difficult to continue. Tonight, the CCP side stated that due to the lack of results from the Five-Person Talks, the Three-Person Conference may reopen, but the time and location of the reopening are still undetermined.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] At 4:00 PM today, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall. The content of the conversation included approximately two points: firstly, the study of the format of the negotiations, because based on the past lack of results from direct three-party talks, it was believed that there was a need to change the format of the negotiations. At the same time, he reported on the progress of the second round of talks and the focus of the disputes between the two sides. Secondly, discussions on mediating the conflict in the Central Plains. The CCP side stated, "If the ceasefire does not occur, Li Xiannian may seek other paths to 'fight for survival'," the implication being quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, visited Zhou Enlai this afternoon and then visited Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the Central Plains Communist Army Li Xiannian's unit withdrew westward from Xuanhuadian, the CCP delegation actually submitted a memorandum of protest to the Military Three-Person Group and handed it over to Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the government's scheduled convening of the National Assembly, the CCP delegation lodged a strong protest to the government representatives and Chairman Chiang on the 7th, including the statement: "Our side solemnly declares to your side that regarding the National Assembly issues, before an agreement is reached, our side will not be bound by any unilateral decisions made by your side. Our side also insists on the rapid opening of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group to discuss the National Assembly and related issues. If your side continues to refuse and disputes arise as a result, the responsibility should be borne by your side."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The "July 7th" declaration issued by the CCP side yesterday has been translated into English by the government side and forwarded to Marshall by Yu Dawei, and the Chinese manuscript has been sent to General He Yingqin to serve as the basis for discussions. It is reported that Marshall's residence held an internal meeting this morning to possibly study the CCP's declaration.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming-Lin Biao Changchun Talks to be Local Negotiations; Everything Still Depends on Nanjing Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 8th] The situation in the Northeast seems to be showing a glimmer of hope due to the scheduled meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao, and some people may have even greater hopes. However, according to opinions from various sources, everything still depends on consultations in Nanjing. At the same time, the Communist army is actively deploying during the ceasefire period and has now completed its expected work in various places. In addition, the international situation makes it difficult to be optimistic, and the atmosphere of tension may become more pronounced.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao on Friday was promoted by the sincerity of Dai Boer. Although news reporters attach great importance to this dramatic news, powerful figures here have no concrete expectations for what kind of results the Du-Lin meeting will achieve. One influential figure told the reporter, "What five-star marshals cannot solve, one-star officers cannot solve either." The person in charge denied that the Changchun talks would discuss the takeover of Harbin, saying that big problems cannot be solved without solving the small ones. It is reported that Dai Boer once talked about the origin of his efforts to promote the Du-Lin meeting, saying, "Commanders of both sides often cannot implement the orders of their subordinates. Now let them talk to each other." If this is true, it is also a local meeting for direct negotiations in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Ridiculous Rumor</h3>
<p>Claim that National Army Planes Flew to Yan'an is Absolutely Impossible</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The World Daily reported on the 7th that nine National Army planes flew to Yan'an on the 5th. After the reporter inquired with various parties, Wang Shuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, stated that after contacting Nanjing, it was proven that this news was completely unfounded because Yan'an has no nighttime landing equipment. He also stated that this news was insulting to the Air Force and would be protested. The CCP side of the Military Mediation Department showed its Xinhua News Agency Yan'an telegram, which stated that Captain Liu Shanben, the pilot of the 35th Squadron of the 8th Brigade of the Central Aviation Brigade, and ten others, flew a B-24 aircraft numbered 530 from Chengdu on the 26th of last month and arrived at the Yan'an airfield at 3:00 PM, but the names of the ten people other than Liu Shanben were not announced. It was also said that on the 20th, all circles in Yan'an held a meeting to welcome them, and Mao Zedong and Zhu De both attended.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 8th] More than 2,000 Communist troops from Dongxi Guanyingzi suddenly attacked Beipiao on the 1st, causing great damage to the mining area.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong's Inspection is Not of the Northeast Region</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Gu Zhutong, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Ministry of National Defense, has flown to the Northeast. This is Mr. Gu's first inspection since taking office.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 8th] The Communist Army (Central Plains Military Region) troops are continuing to fiercely attack various locations. On the 7th, the Wen Jianwu Column, led by Li Xiannian, continued to fiercely attack the vicinity of Xinyang and the area north of Zaoyang after passing near Huyangzhen. The National Army is intercepting them along the way, and the fighting is fierce. The Communist Army's Wang Shushen Column crossed the Xiang River westward via Maochifan on the same day, fiercely attacking Yicheng. The Communist Army east of the Pinghan Road is continuing to create disturbances between Shangcheng, Lihuang, Luotian, and Macheng, and the local area is widely ravaged.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th] The First Column of the Communist Army's Henan-Hubei Military Region, led by Li Xiannian, under the command of Wang Shushen, launched a fierce attack on Suiyangdian from Maochifan on the evening of the 7th to the morning of the 8th, attempting to seize Zaoyang directly and capture Xiangfan.

<p>(3) Taiwan Sugar Company: The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have been ordered to thoroughly investigate. If there is any impropriety, it will be immediately revoked and publicly announced. (Please refer to the Economic Section for this matter.)</p>
<p>(4) Participating in Peace Conferences: Our country is recognized as one of the five major powers, which is recognized by various countries themselves, not requested by us. If we cannot participate as an invited country, our people will deeply regret it.</p>
<p>(5) War Damage Compensation: Japanese public opinion also admits that China should account for 70% of all Japanese reparations, and other countries should account for 30% in total because China suffered the most damage. In the future, we will definitely be able to obtain the largest amount of compensation at the peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>(6) Export Trade: Low-interest loans will be issued by the Central Bank, and other remedial measures are also under consideration.</p>
<p>(7) Legal Tender Black Market: The government is discussing countermeasures with the American advisor of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(8) State-Owned Enterprises: The government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. Therefore, the term of establishment for each state-owned company is two years. This is a transitional measure, but the government has no obligation to allow a few people to obtain exorbitant profits. Currently, the China Textile Company has made considerable contributions to finance.</p>
<p>(9) Prices and Currency: If domestic peace and unity can be truly achieved, currency issuance can be stopped in a very short period of time. Regarding this issue, the Minister of Finance was invited to Shanghai the other day to jointly study with the President of the Central Bank. As for loans from the United States, they are still under negotiation and have not yet reached the stage of announcement.</p>
<p>(10) Shipping: State-owned and private enterprises are treated equally. The Minsheng Company's ships in Canada are guaranteed by the government, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also has a day of being privately owned. Opening the four ports of the Yangtze River is an expedient measure to remedy the lack of ships. I have made the greatest efforts to strive for sovereignty and will never do anything to sell it out.</p>
<p>(11) Grain Requisition: Grain requisition is an important measure to control food and stabilize grain prices. The Ministry of Food can answer questions about the details.</p>
<p>(12) Civil Servant Treatment: Responsible officials from Chairman Chiang downwards are almost always seeking countermeasures and planning to gradually restore the pre-war living standards, but the conclusion depends on the domestic and foreign situation.</p>
<p>(13) Investigation and Reception: I extremely welcome the investigation teams organized by the three agencies of the Control Yuan to conduct separate investigations. The work of receiving enemy and puppet industries is very difficult and was initially very chaotic. Liu Gongwu in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area is exceptionally honest and conscientious. I did not know Qi Yueqi in the Beiping-Tianjin area and Lin Ziyin in the Guangdong area before, but I cannot guarantee whether their subordinates are honest. If there are any mistakes, I will definitely not be lenient.</p>
<p>After Mr. Song resigned amidst applause, Minister Peng of the Ministry of Propaganda continued to answer reporters' questions. Mr. Peng first said that the details of the government's negotiations with the Communist Party could not be fully disclosed for fear of affecting the progress of the negotiations between the two sides and making special envoy Marshall feel difficult. In short, what the government values most at present is troop reorganization and determining troop garrison locations. If these two points are not determined, then everything will be empty talk. In addition, there are the following points: (1) The sovereignty of the Northeast must be truly restored. (2) Transportation between Guan Nei (inside the Great Wall) and the Northeast must be smooth and unobstructed. Therefore, the security and order along the Beining Road, including the eastern part of Rehe, must be effectively guaranteed. (3) The railways and coal mines in Shandong must be quickly restored and their security ensured. The areas occupied by the Communist Army in violation of orders after June 7 must be immediately evacuated. (4) The return of refugees from northern Jiangsu is imperative.</p>
<h3>The Communist "July 7th" Declaration is Incomprehensible; Convening the National Assembly is to Implement Constitutional Government; Minister Peng Issues a Statement to Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>At 4:00 PM, Mr. Song, Mr. Peng, and Mayor Wu also received foreign reporters and answered various questions separately.</p>
<p>President Song said:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding anti-American propaganda, the general public in China is very grateful to the United States for all the assistance it has given to China. However, the Communist Party has a lot of aversion to the current policy of the United States. The government cannot interfere with the actions of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Regarding the food issue, the general situation of this year's autumn harvest is still good, and it is expected that the food problem across the country will gradually improve within two months. The price of rice in Sichuan Province has fallen to more than 20,000 yuan. If there is a way to transport and distribute it, grain prices in various places may also gradually decline.</p>
<p>After President Song finished his speech, Minister Peng gave a speech on the issue of the Communist Party:</p>
<p>(1) The conclusion of a complete cessation of conflict lies in the reorganization of vehicles and the determination of military garrison areas. If these two issues cannot be resolved concretely, then conflicts between the troops of both sides may be inevitable.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Communist Party's request to reopen the Political Consultative Conference, Minister Peng said: The Political Consultative Conference was convened before April, and agreements were reached on various issues. However, in the past April, the Communist Party has repeatedly violated various agreements, such as: (A) forcibly occupying the Northeast; (B) delaying the submission of the list of members of the National Government Committee; (C) also delaying the submission of the list of the number and commanders of the Communist Army on various pretexts.</p>
<p>(3) The government decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12, and its intention is to bring the period of political tutelage to an end and allow constitutional government to begin. However, although the Communist Party emphasized "reorganizing the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang" in its "July 7th" declaration, it also declared that the Communist Party would not be bound by the National Assembly date determined by the government, and its intention is quite incomprehensible. However, the government has always hoped that the Communist Party can cooperate in a spirit of cooperation to jointly seek the implementation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>(4) The Communist Party's "July 7th" declaration has many attacks on the policy of the US government. The current so-called "anti-American movement" has attracted much attention from all walks of life in the United States. However, after consulting the Communist Party's "July 7th" declaration, it should not be difficult to guess who initiated this anti-American propaganda.</p>

<h3>Sympathy for the People of the Recovered Areas in Cultivating Wasteland: This Year's Rent and Tax Exemptions; The Executive Yuan Has Notified All Localities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The central authorities, in order to show sympathy for the farmers in the recovered areas, previously issued an order to exempt farmland tax in the recovered areas for one year in the 34th year of the Republic. Now, in order to promote reconstruction work and encourage people to cultivate wasteland, and for land that has become desolate due to the Japanese occupation and cannot be reclaimed this year, rent and tax will be exempted for one year this year. The relevant authorities at all levels should report this for approval according to the procedures for reducing and exempting taxes to show sympathy. The Executive Yuan has recently issued a notice to the local authorities.</p>
<h3>The Fifteen Public Organizations of Shanghai City Give a Farewell to General He Yingqin; Chairman of the Assembly, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Delivers a Farewell Speech; Mr. He's Mission is Important and He Will Surely Bring Glory to the Country</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council and head of the Chinese Military Representative Delegation to the United States, is scheduled to depart for the United States on the 11th of this month. Yesterday at 7:00 p.m., the city's Provisional Council, Local Association, Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, Bankers Association, General Labor Union, Municipal Education Association, Journalists Association, Newspaper Association, Municipal Farmers Association, Women's Association, Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, National Diplomacy Association, and the Catholic Public Association, totaling fifteen public organizations, jointly held a grand farewell party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Mayor Wu Guozhen, former Mayor Qian Dajun, Commander Xuan Tiewu, bureau chiefs, and Central Committee members residing in Shanghai, including Li Shizeng, Peng Xuepei, Huang Shaohong, and Li Hanhun, were invited to accompany them. Hosts Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Ji, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Feng Youzhen, Zhou Feicheng, Zhou Xuexiang, and others, as well as directors and supervisors of organizations, totaling about two hundred people, attended. The assembly adjourned at around 10:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Farewell Address</p>
<p>The assembly began with Chairman Pan Gongzhan, on behalf of the public organizations, presenting a commemorative album with the signatures of all members to General He and delivering a farewell speech. He briefly stated: Today, the fifteen public organizations of Shanghai represent the 3.5 million citizens of the city in bidding farewell to Chief He as he is sent abroad on a mission. We are honored that Chief He has taken time out of his busy schedule to grace us with his presence, allowing us to express our respect to him. The citizens of Shanghai have long admired Chief He's past achievements, which need no further elaboration. In his early years, Chief He dedicated himself to the revolution, first following the Father of the Nation and then the President, serving the country by assisting in the founding of the military academy in Guangdong and then leading the Northern Expedition, up to the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. He planned strategies in the headquarters and won battles on the battlefield. After the victory, he was ordered to preside over the surrender and completed his mission in a very short time. Most recently, he is admired by our compatriots for establishing the Ministry of National Defense due to the unification of the central military organization and issuing a "Letter to All Soldiers of the Nation," leading by example, expressing humility, and leading meritorious soldiers to complete the task of reducing the army, creating a new atmosphere in the Chinese military. Now, Chief He has another important mission to represent China in the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council as the head of the delegation and also serve as the head of the Chinese Military Representative Delegation to the United States, which will depart soon. China is now one of the five powers, and its actions are closely related to those of other countries around the world. Cooperation with allies, especially with the United States, must be further strengthened to ensure collective world security. His mission is arduous, and with Chief He's history and expectations, he is the most suitable talent to be the head of the Chinese delegation. We firmly believe that he will be able to complete his mission and bring glory to the country. All the citizens of Shanghai respectfully anticipate Chief He's success.</p>
<p>Mr. He Yingqin's Reply</p>
<p>Then, General He Yingqin stood up and gave a reply, briefly stating: Today, I am deeply grateful for the farewell given by the fifteen public organizations of Shanghai. Recalling entering the Whampoa Military Academy in the 13th year of the Republic, following the Chairman, and then following the Chairman in the Northern Expedition and then the War of Resistance against Japan, it has been more than twenty years. During this time, I have mainly been engaged in military work, and fortunately, I have been able to complete many difficult and important tasks. This is truly due to the leadership and guidance of the supreme leader and the concerted efforts of party, government, and military comrades, staff, and local people. This trip to the United States has two major tasks: (1) to cooperate with the international community, and (2) to promote military cooperation and connection between China and the United States. I am aware that the relationship is important and the task is arduous. Entrusted with the mission of the Chairman and the expectations of all sectors of society, my talent and ability are limited, and I hope that everyone will give guidance at any time. Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the world and the economic and cultural center of China. The prosperity of Shanghai can affect the whole country. When I came to Shanghai for the first time after the Japanese surrender last year, I felt that Shanghai had built a lot in the past, and its prosperity was all within the former concession area. Now that the concessions have been recovered and extraterritoriality has been abolished, the good scale should be preserved and further developed, and the bad habits of the past should be eliminated. Recently, the luxurious and extravagant phenomena in Shanghai should be improved, and efforts should be concentrated on developing production industries. Other aspects, such as transportation, security, education, and hygiene, should also be continuously improved. Although things are very ordinary, I hope that citizens can recognize their importance, and I hope that all advanced sectors will cooperate with the government, work together, conduct planned progress, lead the people, and assist the government in building a new Shanghai. When I come back in the future, I deeply hope that Shanghai will be more advanced than it is now. After the speech, he raised his glass and wished the Chairman health and the local leaders of Shanghai health.</p>
<p>Finally, Li Shizeng also, according to He's intention, hoped that the people and the government would fully cooperate, and then international cooperation and world peace could be achieved. He also said that President Chiang and his wife are planning to convene a joint conference of international collective cooperation organizations in China in three years, the same as the one held in the United States before, and hoped that Chief He would introduce the advantages of this kind of conference to China. General He left at 8:00 p.m. due to another appointment.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Blocking the Yellow River; A Terrible Disaster May Reoccur</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Yellow River blocking project cannot be expected to be completed due to repeated obstruction by the Communist army, delaying it for as long as two months. Now the water level of the Yellow River is gradually rising, and the breach at Huayuankou has turbulent water, making the blocking project extremely difficult. The iron bridge of the Haizhou-Tie Road in the territory of Zhongmou County was destroyed two weeks ago, and the river water has already overflowed. If the breach cannot be blocked before the autumn floods, the tragedy of the breach in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng area will be replayed today.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Agricultural Team Arrives in Beijing; Will Go to Various Parts of the Country for Inspection; Then Submit a Report to Our Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Chinese and American members of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team, more than 20 people, arrived in Beijing by car at 5:00 p.m. on the 8th. Minister Zhou Yichun and Deputy Minister Yan Shenyu welcomed them at the station. The American members of the team arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 24th of last month and were formally established after meeting with our country's members. The entire team consists of eleven Chinese and eleven American agricultural experts, all of whom were selected and appointed by the agricultural departments of the two countries at the request of our Executive Yuan. The organization of the team is in response to the need for our country to accelerate agricultural reconstruction after the war. The American head of the team, Mr. Hutchison, told reporters at the station: The team will visit President Chiang to pay their respects and visit various universities and academic institutions in the country in order to gain a deeper understanding of the Chinese education system. He himself will return to the United States in November. During this period, he will go to various parts of China, and even the northeastern provinces, for inspection, and he hopes that this trip will contribute to Sino-American agricultural cooperation: (1) Investigate the agricultural conditions of our country and report to our government as a reference for our country's agricultural policy in the future; (2) Study the methods of Sino-American cooperation in the production and promotion of our country's main agricultural export products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, wool, and fish; (3) Suggestions on urgent issues in our country's current agricultural construction. However, all investigation and research results and suggestions are the joint opinions of Chinese and American experts, and at the same time, they are recommended to the Chinese and American governments for reference. The American members are scheduled to stay in China for four and a half months or two years. Our government does not pay their salaries, but only bears the costs of accommodation and transportation. The country will stay in Beijing for about a week and then go to various parts of the country for inspection in groups, first from Beijing to Ping, then to Panyang, via Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Liuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, Hangzhou, and back to Nanjing, to conduct research together and then submit a report to our government.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes American Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] Soviet commentator Isakov wrote an article in "Pravda" pointing out that the United States is helping the Chinese Nationalist government, undermining the domestic ceasefire agreement, and preparing to launch an anti-communist movement, which will inevitably lead to further expansion of the civil war. The article stated: If the United States can stop supplying arms and materials to one side that is launching a civil war, then the Chinese civil war will automatically stop. However, American military aid has not ended with the end of World War II, but has continued to extend and expand, such as the Lend-Lease Act and the plan to train and equip one million Chinese soldiers. Lend-Lease supplies stopped in August 1945, but the US government continued to supply China with goods worth 58 million US dollars. The US government continues to supply China with huge amounts of war materials based on laws that have already ceased to be effective, and the activities of the US military in China are the main reason for the current situation in China. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference declared its support for the principle of non-interference in Chinese affairs, and the US policy in China is not in line with these principles.</p>
<h3>The Qiantang River Has a Big Flood; Boats and Ships Are Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Qiantang River has already had a big flood, and ships are difficult to navigate. Water transportation between Hangzhou and Lanxi has become difficult. The Tonglu passenger ship may also be suspended. Low-lying areas in the Hangzhou-Jia-Wu area have become swamps. The people of Zhejiang are very afraid of the coming of the flood.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Flood Prevention Committee Raises Funds to Prepare for Rescue</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] The weather in Wuhan has cleared, and it is hoped that the water level can be lowered, but the water level rose to 24.726 meters last night and is still slightly rising this morning. It is expected that it will be difficult to fall back within the day. The local Flood Prevention Committee decided to raise 200 million yuan to prepare for rescue. It was also announced that the Da Zha drainage machine has started drainage work yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wen Ni Zongyao Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Executive Yuan, Su-Ning Branch Actively Promotes Work Relief; Completes River Dredging, Road Repair, and Embankment Construction Projects; Mobilizes Disaster Workers to Kill a Large Number of Rice Grasshoppers</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Correspondence] According to the Executive Yuan, Su-Ning Branch: Since its official establishment on January 16th of this year, it has actively promoted civil engineering projects such as river dredging, road repair, and embankment construction as work relief. As of the end of this month, the branch has completed the earth embankment project of the Jiangnan Seawall, the dredging project of the Zhenwu Canal, the renovation project of the Zhenwu Road, the Guijiang Sanba project of the Jiangbei Canal, small-scale river dredging and embankment construction projects in more than ten counties including Zhenjiang, Wujin, and Jiangyin, the Five Rivers and Six Embankments project in Huaian and Guanyun in the Communist area, and other sporadic work relief projects in various places. As of the end of this month, a total of 700,000 workers and refugees in this province have been mobilized, completing 850,000 cubic meters of earthwork, dredging more than 20,000 meters of sewers in Xuzhou, completing two damming dams on the Jiangbei Canal, benefiting the local area, and relieving disaster victims. The effectiveness is very broad. The branch believes that the farming season is approaching, and various disaster workers and refugees can participate in rural work, so the first phase of the relief work project will end soon, and staff will be dispatched to use the farming season to conduct various water conservancy engineering designs and surveys so as to greatly reorganize the water conservancy highways in the jurisdiction of the branch after the autumn to lay the foundation for post-disaster relief. In addition, according to reports, locust plagues are severe this year in Nanjing Baguazhou Jurong, Jiangpu, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Lishui. Since April, thousands of disaster workers and refugees have been mobilized to dig up eggs and catch nymphs, and flour is issued by weight as work relief. As of the end of June, more than 50 tons of nymphs and more than 2,000 catties of locust eggs have been killed. In addition, rice stem borer control work was launched in Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other places. A demonstration area for drug prevention and control was delineated, and rice stem borer control associations were organized to actively promote work relief and rice stem borer control. Recently, in the Wuxi Suzhou demonstration area, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the College of Education have jointly spread a large amount of DDT powder, totaling three and a half tons, covering more than 1,600 mu of rice fields, which has been quite effective. Many visitors have come to visit. It is heard that many reporters from the Associated Press and Mr. Gling, the chief agricultural expert of UNRRA in China, have also gone to investigate and visit, and added instructions, believing that the results are satisfactory.</p>
<p>Kunshan and Four Counties Hold a Joint Patrol to Search and Suppress Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>The local authorities of this county, in order to jointly search and suppress remnant bandits with neighboring counties, held a joint patrol with Changshu Taicang and Qingpu counties on the 5th.

<p>Wuxi: A Heinous Secret Agent Arrested and Imprisoned</p>
<p>Lu Ziyu, from Huangtang, Jiangyin, served as a secret agent for the puppet Qingxiang Brigade and the puppet police brigade during the enemy and puppet regime. He was cruel and ruthless by nature, and often used the power of the enemy and puppet regime to extort everywhere and kill anti-Japanese comrades. After the victory, he went into hiding in the countryside and colluded with his mistress to traffic drugs to harm the people. Recently, the ban on drugs in Chengyi has been strict, and Lu immediately hid in Zhoushanbang in this county and continued to secretly sell drugs. At 10:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, he was discovered by the local court of this county and was arrested and sent to the court for interrogation according to law.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Investigation and Reporting of the Fengjing Massacre Case</p>
<p>In Qianjiacao, Seventeenth Group, Fengjing District, on the second day of the second lunar month in the 27th year of the Republic, Li Zhiqin and 69 other farmers were shot with machine guns and buried alive by Imai Tatsuya, under the command of the Xiaoquan Unit of the enemy soldiers, in the name of the Fengjing Railway Guard Team Leader. Seventeen other farmers in the area were detained in the town for supervision. Two days later, these seventeen were all brutally killed with bayonets. After Ling Jingxing, a town resident, reported to the Provincial Security Command, it was forwarded to Ding Datong, the Fengjing District Chief, for verification. The names of the murdered farmers and the losses in the countryside have been reported to the county government and forwarded to the Provincial Security Command for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Hefei: Wang Yitang's Property Confiscated</p>

<h3>Officials of Pingjing City Host a Banquet for the American Secretary of the Navy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] American Secretary of the Navy Forrestal was originally scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 8th to inspect the US military, but it was changed to the 9th due to unforeseen circumstances. On the evening of the 8th, Director Li of the Xingying, Commander Sun Lianzhong of the Eleventh War Zone, and Mayor Xiong Bin hosted a banquet at the Qin Zhengdian in Zhongnanhai to welcome him.</p>

He was originally scheduled to leave for Shanghai this afternoon, but it was postponed for one day until tomorrow morning in order to host a cocktail party and a banquet to entertain some of the US Marines in Pingjing. According to the Marines who attended the meeting, they learned very little news from the Secretary, because the Secretary always avoided answering their questions and instead asked them various questions. However, Mr. Forrestal did express concern for the US military itself, repeatedly talking about the military service point system, and was quite concerned about the details of the US military's protection of the North China Railway.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Self-Reflection on Economic Policies</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, at the Shanghai Municipal Government, hosted reporters, listened to the opinions of the press, answered inquiries, and stated that "I have always respected public opinion." Indeed, Premier Song's answers to various points yesterday were very frank and straightforward. For example, regarding the grain loan case, he said that grain merchants who commit fraud should be severely punished, and grain officials who commit fraud should be even more severely punished, and no one will be shielded; if Changjiang Fuzhong and other companies have official capital, they should be punished; the increase in grain prices has been ordered to be thoroughly investigated by the responsible departments; the China Textile Company will definitely be sold to private management in the future; state-run shipping and private shipping must be treated equally; foreign ships sailing on the Yangtze River will be discussed with shipping merchants from an objective perspective; he hopes that domestic unity will be achieved, transportation will be restored, and currency issuance can be stopped, because "currency inflation stimulates prices and is the most painful." All of the above are Premier Song's clear and direct answers, which can at least explain people's previous doubts, and can at least let people know that the authorities are still moving towards the road of "good government." This attitude of the administrative authorities and this style of valuing public opinion cannot but be said to be a symbol of the government's recent progress.</p>
<p>After listening to Premier Song's answers, we would like to raise another issue of self-reflection on economic policies here, because we believe this is a question of whether reality matches ideals. In March of this year, when the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held, Premier Song reported to the conference, saying: "The most urgent and serious problem at present is the economic problem. The current economic situation can be said to be unsatisfactory to everyone, which is inevitable. Even I personally feel not only that I cannot be satisfied, but also that I am extremely dissatisfied." Premier Song's frank statement can move us; and what is especially gratifying is that he proposed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan at the Second Plenary Session. This plan stipulates four principles: (1) Expand new sources of tax revenue to curb the rapid expansion of currency; (2) The new sources of tax revenue should be based on the principles of the People's Livelihood, restricting capital and equalizing land ownership, and strive to implement them; (3) Effectively resolve labor-management disputes; (4) Adjust the treatment of public and private school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and industrial workers, striving for fairness and reasonableness. The measures stipulated based on these four principles are: (1) Conduct a general registration of property and levy a one-time property tax, (2) Levy stock exchange tax and transaction tax, (3) Implement a special excessive profit tax, (4) Formulate measures for handling employee treatment disputes in state-owned and private enterprises. Except for state-owned enterprises, which are not allowed to strike or slow down work, a labor-management arbitration committee will be established, which has the power of compulsory arbitration over labor-management disputes in private enterprises, (5) Re-adjust the treatment of public and private school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and industrial workers. From the above description, it can be seen that to solve the economic problem today, it is by no means something that can be done solely by an economic department, nor can it be solved solely by discussing dozens of economic policy guidelines by the Economic Planning Commission, but must rely on Premier Song's decision-making and the cooperation of the Ministry of Finance. To be honest, if we leave the Ministry of Finance, leave the currency issue, and avoid discussing this most fundamental problem, and only want to talk about economics in terms of economics, we dare to say that even if this road is not impassable, at least it will be twice the effort with half the result.</p>
<p>We, the common people, have the right to demand from the government today to first conduct a thorough self-reflection on the current economic policies. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about this "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" that has been passed for more than three months. Please, the government, ask yourself: How many points have been implemented now? Apart from the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee in Shanghai and the Executive Yuan's one-time adjustment of the treatment of public and private school teachers, what other achievements have been made? How many new sources of tax revenue have been developed? Has the general registration of property been carried out? Has the property tax been levied? Has the rapid expansion of currency been curbed? Now, in all economic policies, has attention been paid to the principles of restricting capital and equalizing land ownership? Is the treatment of employees in state-owned industries more excessive than the income of ordinary public and private school teachers? In all of these, the government has clearly and solemnly proposed and the Central Plenary Session has passed the motion. Premier Song, without shirking responsibility, should re-draw the attention and examination of various competent departments, and then it can be judged how the performance of these "government agencies" is. We believe that if this motion is renamed the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," then any economic-related department of the Executive Yuan has the responsibility to strive to implement it, and no one is allowed to shirk it. Otherwise, if there are no "measures," there is even less talk of "emergency." The result of the de facto shelving will inevitably make the current economic situation still "unsatisfactory to everyone" as it was three months ago, and Premier Song may still be "one of the extremely dissatisfied." If so, how will the various competent departments of the Executive Yuan face Premier Song? How will they face the Second Plenary Session? And how will they face the people of the whole country?</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not need to make any new demands on the government today, but only hope that the government will examine its economic policies without any concealment.</p>

<h3>European Peace Conference Procedural Issues: Soviet Representative Sticks to Original Position; Four Foreign Ministers Met Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Current Stalemate Still Not Broken</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting was held again this morning, attempting to break the deadlock. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Molotov debated fiercely for two hours. Molotov insisted that invitation letters could only be issued after the peace conference procedures had been decided. However, Byrnes and Bevin stated that procedural issues could be discussed as suggestions but opposed forcing other countries to accept them. As a result of the heated debate, the stalemate could not be broken. In the afternoon (Shanghai midnight), the Four-Power Foreign Ministers will meet again, with secret talks beforehand. It is rumored that the French side has proposed a compromise plan, but it is not yet known whether it will be accepted by the U.S. and Soviet sides.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: Molotov advocates discussing peace treaties separately with each country: (1) Norway is not allowed to participate in any of the five committees discussing peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. (2) China, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, Abyssinia, and Poland can only participate in negotiations on the major peace treaty. (3) The United States should not participate in the Finnish peace treaty. (4) Britain, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, the Czech Republic can participate in any committee among the five committees. (5) Canada is not allowed to participate in the Bulgarian peace treaty. (6) Greece will participate in the peace treaties with Italy and Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia will participate in the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] The Four Foreign Ministers held two meetings today, the first at 11:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. Shanghai time) and the second in the afternoon. It is expected that the Four Foreign Ministers will strive to break the stalemate of last week, which has prevented the progress of the 21-nation peace conference scheduled for July 29.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] The two main points revealed by the debates of the Four Foreign Ministers in the past two days are: (1) Molotov firmly prevents the convening of a peace conference that can decide on the rules of procedure; (2) British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also firmly stated that the right of the 17 countries other than the Four Powers to veto opposition to the conference schedule or the conference's formulation of procedural rules must be maintained. Observers here believe that the impression gained from the past two meetings is that Molotov's firm disagreement to issue invitation letters is even stronger than his desire to have people accept his procedural rules. Most people speculate that his motives for not wanting to invite various countries to participate in the peace conference are to place real power in the hands of the Four Powers. Although Western countries have strongly protested, if Molotov can remain unchanged, the peace conference issue may be difficult to progress. Therefore, today's meeting key still lies with Molotov. Only by resolving the peace conference issue can we then proceed to discuss the political situation in Germany, Austria, and Italy. Regarding whether China can jointly issue invitation letters, it has not yet been resolved. The Soviet Union's attitude of opposing China's participation remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Austrians Expelled from Soviet-Occupied Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, August 8th] Austrian officials announced today that Soviet authorities ordered the expulsion of 54,000 Austrians from the Soviet-occupied zone at 6:00 a.m. today. It is reported that Red Army trucks are currently stationed in front of the homes of the expelled Austrians, waiting to load furniture and transport them to other Allied-occupied zones. The Soviet Union's reason for expelling the Austrians is that they are of German descent.</p>
<h3>Independence Movement Unfolds in British and French Occupied Zones of the Rhineland; Difficult to Win Broad Mass Support for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Baden-Baden, Germany, August 8th] A movement aimed at establishing an independent Rhineland region has been established in the French-occupied zone, with its headquarters in Kaiserslautern in the Palatinate. Similar movements have already been established in the British zone, but the French authorities have not yet recognized them as formal political parties. According to the leaders of this movement, the independence of the Rhineland can serve as a barrier for France, preventing German attacks, and can also serve as a means of reconciliation between Germany and France. The industry in the Rhineland can therefore be exempted from division due to compensation. The district should be incorporated into the independent state of the Rhineland, and the capital should be set in Koblenz. This issue should be decided by a referendum. Observers predict that this movement will be difficult to win broad mass support for the time being, because the internal divisions are not yet strong. However, if the situation in the Rhineland continues to deteriorate, the Germans, out of disappointment, may turn to this movement in the psychological pursuit of new paths. Currently, the intellectuals in the French Rhineland seem to have anti-Prussian ideas, hoping that Germany can establish a federal foundation with Frankfurt as its capital.</p>
<h3>Anti-Allied Demonstrations Throughout Italy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: The anti-Allied demonstrations that appeared in Rome and Taranto last Saturday have now spread to Brindisi, where students broke into the residences of British officers and abducted Italian women who were dancing with British soldiers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, August 7th] Disturbances continue throughout Italy, and anti-United Nations demonstration movements are emerging one after another. Several incidents occurred in Padua, and there were group demonstration movements in Trieste. A group of students rushed into the café where the British and American military club was located, tore down the British and American flags, replaced them with Italian flags, and then vandalized the building. The police arrived to suppress the situation and arrested several people. In Parma, a statue of King Ahmed II, the former monarch, was destroyed by a landmine. At the same time, for several days, many Italian fascists who were expelled from Switzerland have been approaching the residents of [near the Swiss border].</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, August 7th] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, after returning from Paris, told reporters that Yugoslavia cannot accept the decision of the Four-Power Paris Conference to internationalize Trieste and its surrounding area, because this decision is similar to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which subjects the Slovene and Croat people to the rule of different enemy powers, which is a major blow to our nation. We must continue to strive and ask the Allied nations not to act unilaterally, because we will never accept this decision.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congressional Delegation Publishes Observations on the Soviet Union; Most People Friendly to the U.S.</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, August 7th] Several U.S. Congressmen visited the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East last year and recently published reports describing their observations. The Congressmen unanimously advocated the free exchange of students, scientists, films, and news to maintain good relations between the U.S. and these countries. The observations on the Soviet Union are as follows: The Soviet Union has 185 million non-Communist people, which is a huge latent force friendly to the U.S. If we can find a way to make them understand our sincere wishes, it will definitely promote U.S.-Soviet friendship. In the Soviet Union, as in the U.S., most people seek peace; in the Soviet Union, there is a great need and desire to improve the living standards of civilians. On average, the Soviet people do not have negative feelings towards the U.S. Very few Soviet people understand the scope of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act aid to the Soviet Union. Because the U.S. logos are not obvious, only a few people understand that they are gifts from the U.S. This is not because the Soviet side opposes it, but because the U.S. lacks vision and planning. After we enter the Soviet Union, we can move freely. The telegrams heard and taken by our visitors are all inspected, which is completely true. If the visitors freely express their opinions, it will attract dissatisfaction from the authorities and eventually they will have to leave. All free exchanges of facts, figures, people, news, travelers, and literature can eliminate misunderstandings between the two countries and benefit peace. Soviet military preparations are still continuing on a large scale. The Soviet Union is developing heavy industry and ignoring consumer goods industry. As far as freedom of information is concerned, the Soviet Union lacks modern weapons and mechanical equipment necessary for modern warfare. In the autumn of last year, the Soviet armed forces of the Soviet Union numbered about 12 million. The fact-finding team recommends immediately abandoning the policy of appeasement in every shape and form.</p>

<h3>Philippines Expresses Opposition to Four-Power Control of Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, August 8th] Opposition leader Concepcion claims that he will publicize to the world his opposition to the four powers controlling Japan alone after the end of the military occupation of Japan.

<h3>Tanaka Continues Testimony at the International Tribunal: The Cause and Effect of Japan's Invasion of Northeast China, Lessons Learned from the Battle of Zhanggufeng, Recognizing Japan's Inability to Wage War Against the US</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society, Tokyo, 8th] Following Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Tanaka Ryukichi's thorough exposure of the Japanese military's conspiracy to invade Northeast China at the International Tribunal on the 5th and 6th, he appeared in court again today to answer cross-examination from the defense. Defense counsel Hayato Itaro first asked the witness why he retired from the army when the Pacific War reached its peak. Tanaka replied: "The Battle of Zhanggufeng made me feel the power of material strength early on. That battle was not a victorious battle as reported. I was a artillery company commander at the time, and I can say with certainty that if the battle had continued for two more days, the result would have been the same as the Nomonhan Incident. Regarding negotiations with the United States, although I was unable to directly inquire at the time, I had secretly heard about the progress of the negotiations from Colonel Sato of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Section and Lieutenant General Kimura, the Vice-Minister of the Army."</p>
<p>Military and Naval Discord, Feeling Despair About the War</p>
<p>"As for my resignation from the army, there were two reasons: First, the air defense equipment was poor, and there was discord between the army and navy, with false reports being made to superiors. If I told the truth, I would offend the Army Minister. Worried about the future of the war, I expressed my despair about the war to Tojo on September 21, 1942, and requested to resign. Another reason is that although Tojo said, 'Fight to the last man,' I deeply believed that this was absolutely impossible, so I asked Foreign Minister Togo to initiate a political movement to force Tojo to step down. However, because this matter violated my intention to oppose the military engaging in political movements, I felt that I was no longer qualified as an active-duty soldier and resigned. Also, regarding the Manchurian Incident, I firmly believe that it was not a hastily planned event before the outbreak." (Question) "The witness said that in 1928 there was a plan to build a 'Kingdom of Righteousness' in the Northeast. Was this Kawamoto's personal opinion or the policy of the Tanaka Cabinet?" (Answer) "It was Kawamoto's personal opinion." (Question) "The witness said that the relationship between Japan and 'Manchukuo' after 1928 was a state of undeclared war. Why is that?"</p>
<p>More Than 300 Unresolved Issues in the Three Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>(Answer) "One reason is that in accordance with the Okura-Guaranty Loan Agreement to build the "South Manchurian" parallel railway, there were more than 300 unresolved issues between China and Japan in the Northeast." (Question) "When the Wanpaoshan Incident and the Nakamura Captain Incident occurred, did you know that public opinion was boiling in Japan?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Did you know that the defense of the Chinese army was also being strengthened day by day, and there was a state of imminent outbreak?" (Answer) "Extremely dangerous." (Question) "Did you know that no Chinese soldiers died in the Liutiao Lake Incident?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "Did you know that in the Liutiao Lake Incident, the Chinese army's artillery fire was extremely accurate against our side?" (Answer) "If a war occurred, it should be like that." (Question) "How many Japanese people were in the Northeast when the Manchurian Incident occurred?" (Answer) "I don't know very well, about 100,000 to 150,000." (Question) "What was the number of the Kwantung Army guarding "South Manchuria?" (Answer) "About 6,000." (Question) "Were the administrative affairs of "Manchukuo" handled by "Manchukuo" officials?" (Answer) "At that time, there was dual nationality in Japan and "Manchukuo."" (Question) "Even if they were Japanese, were they considered officials of "Manchukuo?"" (Answer) "After the abolition of extraterritoriality in 1908, Japanese people were considered "Manchukuo" people on the one hand, and also Japanese people at the same time." (Question) "What was the Japanese government's policy toward "Manchukuo?"" (Answer) "To cultivate it under Japanese control." (Question) "Did Hashimoto Kingoro have any relationship with the Japanese government's decision on the "Manchukuo" policy?" (Answer) "As far as I know, no relationship." (Question) "Did the witness serve in the International Prosecution Section?" (Answer) "Because I have held important positions in the past, I am familiar with all the events related to this court, so at the request of the Prosecution Section, I conduct investigations and provide information every day. This is an order from MacArthur Headquarters." (Defense Counsel Yamada asked) "What was the direct cause of the Liutiao Lake Incident?" (Answer) "The dangerous situation between China and Japan in the Northeast was the direct cause. Regarding the bombing of the railway, I really don't know whether it was done by the Chinese or the Japanese. Taking this as a wedge, the Shenyang Incident occurred." (Question) "Why does the witness say that the Liutiao Lake Incident was a war of self-defense?" (Answer) "I am Japanese, so until the end of the Pacific War, I followed the country's advocacy and believed it was a war of self-defense, but whether it was self-defense or not, this court should decide."</p>
<p>More Than 200,000 Chinese Troops Stationed in the Northeast</p>
<p>(Question) "The witness said that there were more than 200,000 Chinese troops in the Northeast at that time. Did you know that these troops were scattered in Shenyang, Changchun, Kuanchengzi, Gongzhuling, and other places?" (Answer) "I am more familiar with this matter than you, but they were in the barracks, not in the concession." Next, defense counsel Ota stood up and said: "The witness's statement that Doihara once served as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is obviously false." Tanaka admitted that it was a mistake. (Question) "What was the purpose of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council?" (Answer) "The purpose of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was, first, to cooperate with Japan in anti-communism; second, to establish close relations with both Japan and "Manchukuo"; and third, to control the political, economic, and military issues of the area as desired by Japan, without infringing on sovereignty." (Question) "Why was the Hebei-Chahar Political Council organized?" (Answer) "After the establishment of "Manchukuo," the Nanjing Central Government took the recovery of lost territories as the center of its national policy and diplomacy. In order to avoid friction, a Sino-Japanese friendly zone was established south of the Great Wall to ensure the security of "Manchukuo."" (Defense counsel Okamoto asked) "What kind of organization was the Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency?" (Answer) "The Special Service Agency, with active-duty soldiers as the center, guided the politics and economy of "Manchukuo."" (Question) "When did Doihara, on the order of General Minami, meet with Song Zheyuan?" (Answer) "In mid-September 1935." (Question) "What was the content of the instructions when Doihara went to Beiping?" (Answer) "The first was anti-communism, and the second was to establish an autonomous zone in North China." (Question) "Did you know that on December 31, 1935, the Vice-Minister of the Army ordered Doihara to go to North China to serve as an instructor for the Hebei-Chahar Political Council?" (Answer) "I have definitely seen that order."</p>
<p>Tanaka Repeatedly Receives Threatening Letters</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] The International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Tanaka Ryukichi testified in court that friction between the Chinese and Japanese people in Manchuria was the reason that prompted the Japanese warlords' determination to seize Manchuria. China's intention to take back Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian, and to abolish the South Manchurian Railway, started an anti-Japanese movement. The defendant's lawyer questioned Tanaka whether the prosecutor had told him that he would testify for the defendant? He replied: "No." He was also asked whether he had received any financial rewards for testifying for the prosecutor this time: "To this day, I have not received a penny." The American prosecutor privately stated: "The situation in Manchuria was indeed tense, but this is not enough to be a reason for Japan to occupy Manchuria."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Lieutenant General Tanaka Ryukichi, an important witness in the recent International Tribunal, has received many anonymous threatening letters and phone calls, warning him not to testify again.</p>
<p>Attempting to Exonerate the Japanese Emperor</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Tanaka Ryukichi has been testifying in court for several days, especially criticizing Tojo. According to our agency's reporter, who is closely associated with Tanaka, Tanaka's actions are not to retaliate against Tojo, but only to exonerate the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Tanaka opposed Tojo's policies from the beginning of the Pacific War. Until the end of last year, when the American prosecutor's team came here to prepare for the trial, Tanaka made extensive contact and served as a guest of Keenan for several weeks. At Tanaka's request, Keenan went to China for a trip, visited Chairman Chiang in China, and held talks, attempting to make Chairman Chiang believe that it was necessary to exempt the Japanese Emperor from trial.</p>

<h3>The Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case Has Bizarre Circumstances: Shen Xin Factory Director Zhan Rongpei Is Actually the Mastermind Behind the Crime, Colluding with Bandits to Work Together Inside and Out, Police Investigation Confirms It, Will Be Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, according to our newspaper's reporter from the police station: Although the bandit leader and part of the accomplices who kidnapped Rong Desheng this time have been captured by the First Pacification Zone Headquarters and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, several important principals directly related to this case have not yet been arrested, and the military authorities are still making every effort to investigate, hoping to close the case as soon as possible. What is most noteworthy is that the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Rong Desheng was actually Zhan Rongpei, the director of the Second Factory of Shen Xin Cotton Mill (In addition to serving as the director of the Second Factory, Zhan also concurrently served as the deputy director of the Huada Enterprise Company established by Wu Zhigang, an accomplice in this case, at No. 24 Central Road in this city). He had been in contact with the bandits before and after the incident, working together inside and out.</p>
<p>It was found that Rong Desheng was kidnapped at 10:00 am on April 25th. Until May 21st, Rong's family received two personal letters from Rong, asking them to prepare 500,000 US dollars for ransom. At 9:00 am that morning, they also received a phone call, asking them to prepare the money, divide it into twelve packages of 120,000 taels each and thirteen packages of 130,000 taels each, and the location for the handover would be notified by phone at 5:00 pm. At that time, the police checked that the phone number was 7344, which belonged to a Russian-owned bakery at No. 234 Albert Road. The bandit using the pseudonym "Zhu" used the phone. When the detectives went to the address, the bandit had already left. The next day, another phone call came, asking to send the money to Pushi Road on the 25th. Originally, Rong's family entrusted a relative named Wu Kunsheng to contact the bandits, but Wu declined due to timidity. So, Zhan Rongpei, the mastermind behind the scenes, volunteered. When the money was sent to Pushi Road on the 25th, the deal could not be completed due to a misunderstanding between the military and police. On the morning of the 27th, Zhan and Wu Zhigang met again at Jinjiang Tea House on Hualong Road, agreeing to send the money to No. 54 Kangrong Court on Fuxi Road on the 28th. At that time, Wu had to hand over Rong Desheng's personal seal, which he carried with him, as proof of payment. As for the total amount of the ransom, yesterday's report stated 395,000 yuan. However, according to Zhan Rongpei's confession at the police station, the bandits initially asked Rong for 2 million US dollars, which was later reduced to 500,000 US dollars, of which 100,000 US dollars was taken by Wu Zhigang for personal gain when the money was handed over.</p>
<p>After the money was handed over at 10:00 am on the 28th, Rong Desheng was released at 10:00 pm. That night, he went to stay at the home of his son-in-law, Kang Nengwei, on McNini Road. Previously, the military had already captured a bandit named Zheng Liantang in an old temple in West Shanghai, with both the money and the person. According to the confession, Zhan Rongpei was the key criminal who initiated the kidnapping of Rong. The police arrested Zhan on the third day after Rong was released. Now, after the investigation confirmed the facts, Yun Tang's case will be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters today for joint handling.</p>
<h3>The Small Boat Used to Imprison Rong Has Been Intercepted, The Building Was Originally a Workshop</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Rong Desheng was kidnapped, Rong's small boat was initially intercepted by the police. However, the boat owner has escaped. It is also learned that this person also received a share, totaling 22,000 US dollars. After being held on the boat for three days, Rong was moved to No. 100 Gongyi Lane, Changshou Road, Caojiadu (see picture). The house was rented by bandit leader Luo Wenqing's son under the alias Zhang one week before the Rong case occurred. It was originally rented by a carpenter as a place to make planks, so the room was very messy (see picture). After Rong moved in, it was not cleaned up, and the gate was closed all day to arouse suspicion. The bandit responsible for guarding him was a woman and a child, who lived in the garret. Rong was imprisoned in the back building on the second floor. The glass windows in the room had been nailed with plywood in advance, so it was extremely dark, and candles had to be lit during the day. Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn and flour tycoon, spent a month in this dark room. Every day, the female bandit took care of his meals. According to Rong's post-incident words, it was not bad.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] According to Mr. Wang Liangchang's words to reporters yesterday, he will follow Madame Chiang's orders, and a group of about five people including Bishop Yu Bin, Huang Qilin, and the general manager of the relief association, Zhuan Ren, will depart for the Northeast at the end of this month to visit the refugees and issue 200 million yuan in funds. The trip will last about two weeks. First, they will fly to Beiping, then Xuan Yang, and then to various places in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Bureau Chief Reports on Housing Management Methods</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The municipal government held a memorial service for the founding father at 9:00 am yesterday. Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau reported: The management of houses is divided into two methods: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment. Symptomatic treatment includes guaranteeing the continuation of ownership for owners, ensuring the continuation of residence for tenants, and cracking down on unreasonable rents. In view of the profiteering of second landlords, it was decided to find ways to crack down on them, and special attention must be paid when mediating disputes. For fundamental treatment, citizens are encouraged to build new houses. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of taxes and the reduction of land value-added tax will be used to relieve their investment constraints. As for the new housing land price tax, it is planned to exempt it for one or two years, and a request has been made to the authorities.</p>
<h3>The Epidemic Has Not Diminished Slightly, Schools and Entertainment Venues Are Prepared to Be Converted into Hospitals, The Municipal Association Branch Launches a Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The spread of cholera in this city has not diminished slightly recently. Yesterday, there were another seventy-eight patients and three deaths. A total of 1,445 patients have been reported, with 95 deaths. In addition, the city's original plague hospitals are already full. After repeated attempts, they still feel insufficient. The Health Bureau is actively planning to convert municipal schools (such as Gezhi Middle School, etc.) into temporary epidemic hospitals. In case the epidemic spreads and becomes more serious, or will borrow various entertainment venues (such as dance halls and theaters) to close as temporary hospitals.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Association held a health research meeting a few days ago, Yin Tiyang, a director of the association, suggested to the association to launch a fundraising campaign to add plague hospitals, aiming to raise funds for 1,000 beds, with 20,000 yuan as a unit, collected by various newspapers on behalf of the association, and to promote publicity to jointly eliminate this public enemy. This suggestion was unanimously approved.</p>
<p>The Health Bureau found that four pastures, Pudong, Yili, Dongfang, Sanyou, and Samsung, were selling skimmed milk as whole milk, seeking huge profits. They were each fined 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Major Embezzlement Case of the Railway Bureau: The First Court Hearing Investigation, The Families of the Criminals Scold Yu Xiangyan, Zhang Hongtu Puts All Responsibility on His Wife, Li Jie Cries That She Only Knew About Profit-Sharing and Did Not Know It Was Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, at ten o'clock yesterday morning, conducted the first preliminary investigation by the prosecutor of the entire bureau on the major embezzlement industry of the two railway bureaus. Due to time constraints, only Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Bokang, Li Jie, Sun Xueshan, Zhu Biguan, Wang Renxuan, Zhang Kaiyuan, and other seven people with relatively high suspicion were questioned. They were escorted from the court's detention center at the hospital at 9:35 yesterday morning. The principal criminal, Zhang Hongtu (director of material), wore a white shirt and potential driver's suit pants, with his eyebrows tightly wrinkled and his head bowed. He looked very distressed. His female subordinate, Li Jie, wore a light purple Guan Hua cloth cheongsam and white leather shoes. When she left the detention center, she covered her face with her small hands. Yu Peien wore a silk short shirt and pants, and his face was very haggard. His mother, who was over sixty years old, and his wife saw him, and their grief came from the heart. They shed tears and tried to deliver some of the food they brought to Yu Peien, but were stopped by the bailiff, and Zhang cried loudly from afar. Their families all scolded Yu Xiangyan, believing that the crime was Yu's alone. They were all harmed by her and would not have a good death in the future.</p>
<p>The hearing began at ten o'clock. The principal criminal, Zhang Hongtu, tried to evade responsibility, and when asked about various issues by the prosecutor, he repeatedly said that he did not know the situation and that it was all his wife's business and had nothing to do with him. During the investigation, Li Jie burst into tears, yelling injustice, saying that she only took the money for "profit-sharing" and did not know it was "embezzlement."

<h3>Ministry of Food Announces Details of Grain Handling, Responding to Inspector Cheng's Accusations to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding the grain case, Cheng, the Inspector of the Jiangsu Inspection Area, previously submitted an accusation to the Executive Yuan, believing that there was a major suspicion of fraud in the selection process. The Executive Yuan then ordered the Ministry of Food to thoroughly investigate in accordance with the law. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Food submitted a report to the Executive Yuan detailing the handling of the grain. The Ministry of Food has now released the text of that reply, the original text of which is as follows: "Case received from the Executive Yuan's instruction Jing Ba Zi No. 2716 dated June 21, 35th year of the Republic of China: "The Supervisory Yuan's Jiangsu Inspector, Cheng Zhongxing, has submitted an accusation to the Yuan regarding the handling of grain by Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, etc., for dereliction of duty and abuse of power. It is imperative to send the original accusation for you to quickly and thoroughly investigate and verify in accordance with the law and report back accordingly." This order, etc. One copy of the original accusation is enclosed. Having received this, we have investigated that the handling of loan funds for Shanghai grain merchants was at the request of various related organizations such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Temporary Council. Because Shanghai had been occupied for many years, the grain trade was controlled by the enemy, and the original large-scale and reputable</p>
<p>grain merchant organizations had been exhausted. At the beginning of the recovery, the food supply for Shanghai citizens was entirely dependent on small-scale merchants and peddlers. Subsequently, prices, grain prices, wages, and transportation costs rose continuously, and the capital of merchants and vendors was limited, making it difficult to turn over funds, and the quantity of purchases and transportation was thereby reduced. The monthly demand for rice for Shanghai citizens is several hundred thousand shi, and there was deep concern that the reserves were too low and it would be difficult to sustain the supply during the transition period. There was a unanimous belief that the government should provide low-interest funds to support grain merchants in fully operating, in order to increase reserves and add to the original reserves. The Ministry's policy has been consistent since the implementation of grain management, which is to support grain merchants in strengthening their power so that they can take on the responsibility of supplying and trading food for the people. Therefore, we instructed the Shanghai Office of the Ministry to consult with the China Farmers Bank to formulate appropriate measures. By April 1 of this year, various parties were urging the matter urgently, so a meeting was held in Shanghai to listen to reports from all parties. It was decided to first use one billion yuan</p>
<p>for a trial loan, and the Grain Administration Office drafted the "Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Measures," which were personally reviewed and revised. On April 3, the Grain Administration Office was instructed to handle the matter. In order to ensure openness and solemnity, with the consent of Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Deputy Speaker Wang Shu of the Municipal Council, and Chairman Xu Jiwang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each representing the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Bean and Rice Trade Association, the lending bank, and the Grain Administration Office, the Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Review Committee was formed. All the terms and conditions that loan merchants should abide by and the responsibilities that the review committee should bear are clearly stipulated in the loan measures and the committee's organizational regulations. All the review and decisions of loan merchants and the assessment of their business are presided over by the committee, with orderly meeting minutes available for review. The Ministry, regarding this case,</p>
<p>has adopted a cautious and open attitude throughout the handling process, and the policies and measures adopted are, in our opinion, without error. As for Article 2 of the loan measures regarding the qualifications of loan merchants, since the main purpose of the loan is to ensure the accurate acquisition of grain, most Shanghai grain merchants have not yet fully registered. After consulting with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bean and Rice Trade Association, it was known that grain merchants with a long history and strong responsibility</p>
<p>could not be easily found. Furthermore, in view of the fact that Shanghai grain merchants had been entrusted twice in the past year to purchase military rice, but failed to faithfully fulfill the contract, after careful consideration, it was stipulated that in addition to members of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, any purchasing and marketing merchant with the ability to transport and sell could also apply for a loan. The purpose was solely to select more capable merchants who could purchase and transport more rice to Shanghai from the transportation areas, in order to fully realize the effectiveness of the loan and accomplish the mission. And the loan merchant</p>
<p>review and decision is of great importance. The Review Committee did not have any intention in mind during the approval of the measures to intentionally relax the regulations and leave room for wrongdoing. Later, due to differing public opinions, it was decided to suspend the loan, and the principal and interest of the loan were recovered. The merchants purchased and transported more than 35,000 Shanghai shi of rice to Shanghai in a very short period of time, as evidenced by reports.</p>
<p>Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, went to the United States on official business and left the country on March 14 of this year. The Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan was only decided on April 1. In fact, the drafting and amendment of the loan measures were not participated in by the commissioner. The loan was decided on April 1, and the Review Committee approved the loan merchants on April 4, which was only four days. The commissioner was in the United States and had no possibility of manipulating the matter.</p>
<p>The commissioner Yang Xizhi is not related to this case. Li Chongnian, the director of the committee, was not originally in charge of the Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan. His introduction of the Lianyi and Jiangbei companies to Wan Molin was only a nomination because the Review Committee believed that they had the ability to transport and sell grain. Each of these companies has its own guarantee for handling the grain, and each company should be responsible for its own performance. As for the Changjiang Company, it was not introduced by Li Chong. Wang Daren, the secretary of the Grain Administration Office who was acting as the director, and Ren Xingya, the chief of the section, only handled the various procedures for this loan. After repeated inquiries from the ministry, they all denied any wrongdoing. However, since the case is under investigation by the Shanghai court and the garrison headquarters, whether these officials have any criminal suspicion should be left to</p>
<p>be handled according to the law. As for whether there are any dereliction of duty in administrative terms, it is also intended to be reviewed after the criminal part is determined. (The original accusation letter, the grain merchant loan measures, the organizational rules of the review committee, and the minutes of various meetings are omitted.)</p>
<h3>Teacher Entices Female Student, Stealing Property and Fleeing</h3>
<p>Li Chaosheng, a wealthy businessman in Pudong, is 56 years old and lives at No. 63, Lane 1, South Gaomu Bridge, Lujiadu, Dongchang Road. He has a daughter, Lingmei, 16 years old, who is studying at Peixin Middle School on the same road. Unexpectedly, she was seduced by Zhuang Xuexian, the director of academic affairs, and Lingmei entered his trap. He then instigated Lingmei to return home at 4 PM on June 21 and steal clothes, jewelry, and 2.5 million in cash, totaling over 10 million, and abscond. Her father investigated and discovered the whole story. On June 24, he reported to the police station, which dispatched officers to arrest Zhuang and the girl, confiscate the stolen goods, and take them to the station for interrogation. After verifying the facts, they were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning. After interrogation by the prosecutor, they were instructed to await further evidence and verification. The girl was taken back by her father for supervision.</p>
<h3>Embezzling 200 Million in Public Funds, Poor Teacher Makes a Fortune, Exposed and Arrested</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Hunan Electric Power Company of the Resources Committee at No. 6, The Bund, received 200 million yuan remitted by the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing on April 18. A payment order was enclosed in a registered airmail letter. The funds were to be withdrawn from the National Treasury of the Central Bank. Because the letter did not specify a detailed address, the post office was unable to deliver it and sent it directly to the Hunan Guild Hall on Quzhenren Road in Nanjing, to be forwarded by the Guild Hall. At that time, the bookkeeper stamped the letter and casually put it away, unaware that it was an important document. It was left on the account table for a long time, and the outer envelope was slightly damaged. Chen Xun (30 years old), a native of Hunan who was residing in the Guild Hall, was a new English teacher at the China Vocational Education Society. He often walked around the accounting room when he had free time. He saw the letter, examined it for a long time, and discovered that it contained a huge payment order. He took it to the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank to inquire about the procedures for withdrawing the money. He was told that the funds were public funds and could not be directly withdrawn. They needed to be transferred to an account first, and then paid upon presentation of an agency receipt. Chen then forged the names of Fang Xiong, the manager of the Hunan Electric Power Company, Wang Naimin, the audit director, and Li Zhenkun, the accounting director, and privately carved two company seals, one square and one rectangular. On May 27, he applied to the Central Bank to open a special fund deposit account No. 30, and then obtained a book of public treasury checks. On June 5, he began to purchase a bicycle, and signed a check for 500,000 yuan. On the 29th, he withdrew another 500,000 yuan. After receiving the money, he exchanged it for two pairs of gold bracelets and a pair of gold earrings, worth over 800,000 yuan. Until the day before yesterday (the 6th), the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank discovered that there were two Hunan Electric Power Companies, and the deposit was suspected of being inconsistent. After strict investigation, it was discovered that the 200 million yuan deposit in the special fund account was a fraudulent account. They reported it to the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and the branch chief She Chun, the criminal section chief Zhou Guanghui, patrol officer Yao Hongzhang, battalion commander Xia Changgen, Li Wenqing, Wu Qilan, Li Bin, Zhao Kuizhen, and others, personally reviewed the case and sent officers to guard the Central Bank. Unexpectedly, at around 10 AM yesterday morning, Chen Xun again posed as a representative from the Sino-American Materials Company and presented a check for 500,000 to purchase flowers. When he went to the Central Bank to withdraw the money, he was arrested by plainclothes police officers and taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. He confessed to embezzlement. There were still several checks he issued, totaling 15 million in legal tender, intending to purchase a Jiefang truck, and to jointly establish a photo studio and purchase a camera, valued at 10,000 yuan. He also deposited 500,000 yuan in the post office, but all were rejected by the Treasury Bureau. Officers were sent to the Hunan Guild Hall to confiscate all the stolen jewelry, which was hidden in the bottom of the thermos. Several counterfeit seals were also seized. He is now being strictly interrogated and will be transferred to the judicial authorities for prosecution in the near future.</p>
<h3>Waiting for the Charity Performance to End, Ma Lianliang Prepares to Surrender</h3>
<p>Ma Lianliang, a famous Peking opera actor, 56 years old, organized a puppet theater organization during the Anti-Japanese War to control everything in the theater world, and repeatedly went to the puppet state of Manchuria to participate in disgraceful performances. After the victory, he was reported to the High Court. Ma then came to Shanghai. The High Prosecutor's Office investigated and found that Ma did have a suspicion of collaborating with the enemy, and immediately issued an arrest warrant. It is reported that the municipal police authorities originally intended to arrest him immediately, but Ma has indicated to the authorities that after the charity performance is over, he will go to the High Court to surrender. It is said that the municipal police authorities will send officers to escort him to prevent him from escaping along the way.</p>
<h3>Reopening Old Wounds, The Case of the Japanese Soldier Killed Ten Years Ago, Yang Wendao Retried, Court Date Not Far Off, Supreme Court Deems Original Judgment Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Yang Wendao, a Cantonese man who was arrested ten years ago for the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Shile'an Road, has now been released on bail for medical treatment. However, he has recently re-engaged Tang Huaizhun, the lawyer who has been working on his behalf for ten years, to prepare for a retrial. He recently received a judgment from the Supreme Court ordering a retrial by the original court. The review had already been judged by the Supreme Court on December 17, 1942. The judgment was issued on February 21, 1943, and the date of service was June 29, 1946, with an interval of three and a half years. However, according to general speculation, now that it has been served, the date of the trial must not be too long. The main text of the judgment is "The original judgment is revoked and returned to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court." Yang Wendao and another defendant, Ye Haisheng, also from Guangdong, were both sentenced to death by the Second Branch of the High Court, so they appealed to the Supreme Court. Ye Haisheng has already died in prison years ago.</p>
<p>The reasons for the Supreme Court's judgment can be roughly divided into three groups: (1) The key to this case lies in a physics book with a hole dug in it to hide a handgun. "The book found at the time was English physics, and how it later became Chinese Practical Physics is quite strange! Both trial courts did not pay attention to this, and used this suddenly appearing Chinese Practical Physics as the basis for the judgment. On this point alone, the original judgment is unsustainable." (2) Ye Haisheng had performed the crime during the trial, but the situation at that time could not be considered a free performance, and Ye "cried out for injustice and dared not speak loudly, how great was the threat he suffered? And whether this threat was the result of torture and forced confession by the police is worthy of attention." (3) The cause of the crime: "The original judgment stated that it was intended to expand the influence of the Tongrenyi and Lianghui associations to which the appellants belonged," thus causing a serious situation, but in fact, "what the appellants did was enough to promote the demise of the two associations, so how could they expand their influence." The judgment emphasized that the witness Hu Xiangfu's identification of the murderer as "wearing a sailor's uniform" was not easy to misidentify. And the results of the examination of the deceased's wounds proved that "the shooting distance was about five centimeters. If it were not someone close to the defendant, how dare they approach to commit the crime? This point is particularly worthy of investigation!" The conclusion stated: "The criminal motive identified in the original judgment, the book used as evidence of the crime, and Ye Haisheng's free performance are all suspicious and should be considered grounds for return." The case was handled by the Criminal Fifth Division of the Supreme Court, presiding judge Wang Zhennan, judges Luo Renbo, Sun Baowei, Liu Enle, and Zhang Zehuan.</p>

<h3>Happy Foes in Court, Sheng Xiuying Sues for Abandonment, Bai Yunshan Denies Relationship, Five-Year-Old Mimi Identifies Father in Court</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Bai Yunshan, who opened casinos such as Lüyuan and Dasheng during the enemy puppet period, was recently sued for abandonment by Sheng Xiuying, a woman from Suzhou, and her five-year-old daughter Mimi. The case was opened for trial in the Criminal Eighth Chamber of the District Court yesterday morning. The plaintiff testified in court that she and Bai were relatives. When Bai opened the Lüyuan wealth platform, she worked as a female employee inside. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic, the defendant relied on his evil power to seduce her and then forced her to live with him. In November of the same lunar year, she gave birth to a daughter, Mimi. But since then, the defendant has become disgusted with them, neglecting the livelihood of the mother and daughter. More recently, he has made threatening remarks, forcing the plaintiff to leave voluntarily, she said. The mother and daughter cried bitterly in court, which was quite tragic. When questioned, the defendant Bai Yunshan claimed that it was all slander, and firmly denied that he had a marital relationship with Sheng, and that she was the wife of his brother-in-law Qu Bingzhang. The judge then asked five-year-old Mimi, who pointed to Bai as her father. The two sides stuck to their own stories, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Circular to Provinces and Cities to Determine Autumn Textbooks</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to coordinate the autumn sales of nationally approved textbooks, the Ministry of Education specifically summoned representatives from the supply offices of nationally approved textbooks to meet in Beijing on the morning of the 6th to discuss the matter. Generally, the situation in East China is the best, and the supply this year can reach more than ten times that of last autumn. The situation in West China, North China, and South China is generally good, but work needs to be stepped up. The Central China region can be assisted by the East China region for supply, and there should be no shortage. The eastern nine provinces have been visited by Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, etc., to print locally in Shenyang, and have already started publishing books. Jinan is currently under siege by the Communist army, and books cannot be transported in. The most critical and independent publishing houses have joined forces to print locally, and the paper is transported by air. The situation in Taiwan is also special. Zhengzhong, Kaiming, and Children's Bookstore have branches there, and the Seven Joint Offices have entrusted them to print locally and supply locally. In order to ensure an adequate supply, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities to formulate quantitative supply contracts with the local Seven Joint Supply Groups, similar to the method used in Anhui Province. The southeastern provinces have begun negotiations separately. Supply groups from other provinces have also been established. It is expected that this quantitative supply method will be approved by the education administrative authorities of various provinces and cities, and there will be no book shortage this autumn. According to reports to the Ministry of Education, the same subject's old books printed by various houses themselves will no longer be sold this autumn. Provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi have been areas where pirated editions are prevalent, with many errors in content. Recently, the Seven Joint Offices hired lawyers to deal with the matter and requested educational administrative agencies to investigate and ban them, and they have gradually disappeared. In the future, nationally approved editions should be able to be supplied everywhere and popularized throughout the country.</p>

<h3>President Yuan Dunli of Beijing Normal College Talks About the Level of National Education in the United States, General Citizens Receive Twelve Years of General Education</h3>
<p>Education period to be extended to fourteen years</p>
<p>Schools emphasize physical education as part of the daily curriculum</p>
<p>[This newspaper report, Nanjing] Mr. Yuan Dunli, the president of Beijing Normal College, who recently returned from the United States, said recently in Beijing: The high level of American citizens is due to the fact that ordinary citizens, excluding the elderly and young, have all received twelve years of general education.

In other words, American citizens all love to have compulsory high school education. In the near future, the education period will be extended to fourteen years, that is, two more years of university education will be received, and what is learned is all general education, such as entering a specialty, and then seeking further education. And the United States especially emphasizes physical education, and the school's daily curriculum includes physical education, which is very effective. The promotion of physical education in our country, to catch up, is a matter of urgency. (Yu)</p>

<h3>Answers to Questions About Household Registration</h3>
<p>Q: Once household registration is established, can it never be changed permanently?</p>
<p>A: No, people have certain reasons to have their household registration cancelled.</p>
<p>Q: What are the reasons for cancelling household registration?</p>
<p>A: Article 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulates the following six types:</p>
<p>1. Death or declaration of death.</p>
<p>2. Loss of nationality of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>3. Moving to another county with the intention of residing there permanently.</p>
<p>4. Transfer of registration due to marriage or divorce.</p>
<p>5. Transfer of registration due to adoption, recognition, or termination of relationship.</p>
<p>6. Other reasons for cancellation of registration.</p>
<p>Q: Marriage, divorce, adoption, and recognition can establish household registration, so why is it stipulated here that household registration must be cancelled?</p>
<p>A: Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that a wife's household registration is based on her husband's household registration. Therefore, the wife's household registration before marriage should be cancelled after marriage because she follows her husband's household registration, otherwise, one person would have two household registrations. For example, if a woman whose household registration is in Zhenjiang marries a Shanghai man, on the one hand, according to the stipulation that the wife's household registration is based on the husband's household registration, she should establish household registration in the Shanghai husband's location. On the other hand, she should cancel her household registration in her original place of origin, Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Divorce, because the marital relationship is cancelled, the wife's obligation to establish household registration with her husband no longer exists, and she can restore her original household registration or move to another place with the intention of residing there permanently to establish household registration. Therefore, after divorce, on the one hand, the household registration that was the same as the husband's before the divorce should be cancelled, and on the other hand, a new household registration should be established.</p>
<p>The termination of the relationship of adoption and recognition should be cancelled, and the reason is the same. Adoption and recognition constitute a parent-child relationship, then the household registration of the parents is the household registration, and the parent-child relationship is not established after the termination of the adoption and recognition relationship, so one party should cancel the household registration established due to the parent-child relationship, and on the other hand, establish a new household registration due to the termination of adoption and recognition.</p>
<p>Q: How do I apply for personal household registration or simultaneous household registration for a family?</p>
<p>A: The person applying for household registration is called the applicant. Household registration registration is based on the applicant himself or the head of the family. When applying, the applicant should obtain an application form from the Bao Office or District Office (Township Office in the county) in the current residence or place of departure, fill it out according to the format, and report it to the District Office through the Bao chief for registration.</p>

<h3>The Black Market Turned From Stable to Weak, the US Dollar Gradually Declined, Falling 190 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday</h3>
<p>The black market was slightly distracted yesterday, funds were avoided, securities activities, and the source of supply was slightly abundant. Although the opening was slightly stable, it rose from 1.94 million to 1.955 million. There were slight sell-offs at high prices, and the rise was certain. Holders suddenly saw the stock market active, and after entering the market, the supply side gradually dominated. The central allocation of 55, the price was 1.94 million. After 10 o'clock, it gradually declined. Near noon, it fell back to 1.92 million, and then it was slightly stable. In the afternoon, the US dollar was miserably down to 2,300 yuan, and the gold market was even more unsupported, falling to 1.885 million, and then it was slightly stable. As a result, it fell 43,000 compared to last Saturday, and jewelry gold retreated to 90,20,000, and the silver dollar was slightly stable. The dark discount was due to the flattening of the silver base, and the interest rate was about 1.5 to 2 cents.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar organization saw weakness, and Canada has also announced the adjustment of exchange rates with the United Kingdom and the United States to avoid the impact of rising US prices and inflation. Buying a house is even more difficult. After opening at 2,510 yuan in the early morning, it repeatedly fell, and by 5 o'clock it had dropped below 2,450 yuan. In the afternoon, people's hearts were even more unsupported, and money changers did not absorb it, and it miserably fell to 2,300 yuan and then it was slightly stable. As a result, it fell 190 yuan miserably compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar also brought a small five yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate retreated from 530 yuan to outside 51 yuan.

<h3>The Grain Price Review Committee Held Its Inaugural Meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday, Stipulating That Meetings Will Be Held Once Every Afternoon in the Future, and a Large Batch of Brazilian Rice Will Be Allocated to Rice Shops Today</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Grain Price Review Committee held its inaugural meeting in the conference hall of the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 pm yesterday. The attendees were Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Yu Kaixian, Ji Mingqi, Gu Yisheng and Wang Bingkun, representatives of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, Zhai Zhenhua and Zhang Xichao, representatives of the Rice Shop Industry Association, Yang Jiushi, representative of the Distribution Industry, and Luo Qinghua, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Representatives of the Municipal Council were absent because they had not yet been appointed. As a result of the discussion, the entire set of review regulations was passed. The main task of the association is to review grain prices. In recent years, rice prices in the producing areas have been higher than those in Shanghai, and rice merchants have felt that they cannot transport them. In the future, the review committee will convene a meeting once every afternoon at 2:00 pm. During the meeting, the supply and demand situation will be reviewed, and reasonable prices will be reviewed with reference to rice prices in the producing areas, plus transportation costs and legal profits. Therefore, the prices will never be as low as the current price limit, nor will they be as high as the black market rice prices. Yesterday was the first meeting, and only the future review methods were determined. From today, rice shops or rice shops will jointly evaluate the prices of the rice grains they have purchased in the joint market in the morning, and then send the rice samples and prices to the review committee at 2:00 pm every afternoon. The prices approved by the review committee must still be approved by Mayor Wu before the rice shops can sell the rice according to this price. Therefore, in one or two days, in addition to the grain distributed by the authorities, the rice shops will supply white rice purchased by them. The rampant black market rice will be defeated without being attacked.</p>
<p>Also, Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Grain Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that a large batch of Brazilian rice can be allocated today, and the quantity is very large. Grade A rice shops can be allocated 30 dan, Grade B 20 dan, and Grade C 10 dan. The price of this Brazilian rice will also be announced today. Also, the rice allocated yesterday totaled 5,180 dan, and the rice allocated in the four, five, and six days totaled 18,012 dan and five dou. A total of more than 20,000 dan of rice have been distributed successively. In theory, there should be no panic in the market. In fact, the rice distributed is enough to meet the needs of Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>The price of flour is still unchanged, weak in the morning and strong at noon. The sales of wheat are still lazy, soybeans are decorated with a small 5-600 yuan, wheat bran is a small 1-200 yuan, oil prices are mediocre, and bean cake is strong.</p>
<h3>Short Sellers Replenish and Public Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>After the public bonds stabilized the day before yesterday, they continued to rise yesterday. Some financial institutions replenished their short positions. Since the opening of 480 yuan, Tongbing rose to 600 yuan, and then it was slightly flat. As a result, it rose 100 yuan compared to last Saturday, Jia Yi rose 70 yuan, Ding rose 50 yuan, and Wu Zhong also rose 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Conflicts with Merchants Over Profits, Direct Allocation Will Be Necessary When Required</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Premier Song Ziwen and Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei received reporters from various newspapers in the City Government meeting room to explain that if the Baoyuan Committee and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation established by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office are indeed raising prices as a pretext, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the competent authorities will thoroughly investigate and suspend operations. Mr. Song Yixin, manager of the company's Business Department, also made the following statement:</p>
<p>Due to transportation difficulties in Taiwan, sugar cannot be purchased in large quantities, which is the only reason for the high market price. Secondly, domestic sales are also very smooth, so supply and demand are disparate. The only solution now is to prohibit sugar merchants from engaging in speculative practices in the market. When necessary, emergency measures will be implemented, namely: (1) direct allocation to users or sale in dry goods stores; (2) restricting illegal transactions by sugar merchants and stipulating a legal profit margin. Mr. Song absolutely denied competing with the people for profits. He said: "It is acceptable to accuse our company of competing with merchants for profits, but it cannot be said that we are competing with the people for profits. The company's business objective is to benefit the general public, and sugar merchants who seek to make excessive profits may be subject to sanctions."</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Loan Arrangement</h3>
<p>[This City News] Various silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have requested loans from banks to actively produce silk and ship it abroad to earn foreign exchange, as they have no funds to pay silk workers. After several discussions between the Central Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and several banks providing loans to silk factories, both parties decided that the Central Bank would temporarily advance funds, with the China Silk Corporation responsible for managing the loans. Ninety thousand yuan will be lent per "dan" (unit of weight) for silk grading 11-12, and one hundred ten thousand yuan per "dan" for silk grading 13-15. The total loan amount is 10 billion yuan, to be completed within four months. All three parties will sign an agreement, which is expected to be formally signed and implemented today or tomorrow. It is estimated that 10,000 "dan" of raw silk, worth approximately US$12 million, can be produced within three months.</p>
<h3>Yang Xiaotian and Others Organize a Production Service Cooperative</h3>
<p>[This City News] Yang Xiaotian, Li Mingyang, Peng Bingcheng, Tao Zefeng, and others recently initiated the organization of the China Production Service Cooperative. Its business includes entrusted buying and selling, customs clearance and transportation, display and consignment sales, etc. The head office is located in Shanghai, with a capital of 100 million yuan. It is said that services will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Subject to Increased Tax and Price Hikes</h3>
<p>It has been learned that the Goods Tax Bureau began adjusting the unified cigarette tax yesterday. Various types of cigarettes have generally increased by more than 20%. The market is fluctuating significantly, with prices rising by about 5% to 10%. However, due to the high cost of production, manufacturers have little profit to gain. After the tax increase, they will have difficulty surviving. Cigarette manufacturers have unanimously requested Director Fang of the Bureau to postpone the tax increase and have voluntarily stopped purchasing tobacco.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Brokers Drive Prices Up, Speculative Funds Follow, Chinese Stocks Gradually Re-emerge, Foreign Stocks Transition From Struggling to Stability</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks suddenly rebounded yesterday, with Guangdong brokers driving up prices. Money houses and retail investors with surplus funds actively invested. Large stocks showed their strength upon opening, and buying interest was strong. At the peak, Yong Yarn rose to 463 yuan, Meiya to 2900 yuan, Jingfu to 197 yuan, Xinguang to 220 yuan, and Dongya to 170 yuan. After noon, the market weakened slightly. Unfavored stocks were not yet favored and there was no significant tension. As a result, Yong Yarn and Meiya closed up 10% to 15% higher than the previous day, Liangfu rose by 5%, and Dongya and Xinguang each rose by 10%. Small and medium-sized cold stocks only formed small rises, and veteran stocks remained flat with no progress.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also showed some stability, but the situation was far less favorable than Chinese stocks, mainly because many held inventory that continued to be temporarily sold. Upon opening, Yisha rose from 7200 yuan to 7600 yuan, then began to struggle. After fluctuating, Yisha, British &amp; Chinese Corporation, and Deji all closed up around 5% compared to last Saturday, while the rest remained stable.</p>

<h3>Looking at Shanghai Education Through Numbers</h3>
<p>Average: One in Every 31 People Receives Education</p>
<p>Shanghai has more than 300 public schools at all levels. It is impossible to describe them all in a short article, so this article will only provide a general report based on the numerical data obtained from interviews.</p>
<p>First, we must ask: How many public schools are there in Shanghai? How many students are there, and how many teachers are there? The numbers in the table below are all statistical data from June of this year.</p>
<h3>The Growth of Shanghai Education</h3>
<p>Written Collectively by the Newspaper's Interview Department</p>
<p>The total number of students is more than 110,000. Based on Shanghai's total population of 3.44 million (population statistics from the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department in May), one in every 31 people receives education. This ratio does not seem very low, and in fact, the school-age population is only a portion of the 3.44 million. Adding the total number of students in private universities, church universities, and various private primary and secondary schools, it can be said that education in Shanghai is already quite widespread.</p>
<p>The ratio of teachers to students varies greatly at different levels of schools. In higher education institutions, there is an average of one teacher for every six to seven students. In secondary schools and Western schools, there is an average of one teacher for every ten students. In primary schools, there is nearly one teacher for every forty students, while in people's schools and remedial schools, there is only one teacher for every sixty students. It seems that there are too few people in society who are enthusiastic and dedicated to fulfilling their obligations. (Here, it may be helpful to compare with the statistical data from New York State in 1944. New York State has a population of 14 million, 1.6 million students in public schools, and 70,000 teachers, averaging one in every ten people receiving education and one teacher for every twenty students.)</p>
<p>Regarding the different qualifications of teachers, the Education Bureau has surveyed more than 1,000 primary school teachers and more than 200 secondary school teachers:</p>
<p>It can be seen from the table above that a considerable number of university graduates are working as primary school teachers, which is somewhat of a "waste of talent." On the other hand, there are also some high school graduates teaching in secondary schools, which may be "difficult to handle." Fortunately, the percentage is not large.</p>
<p>The funding for schools at all levels has been increasing every month this year. It was about 110 million in January, 150 million in February, 180 million in March, 320 million in April, and 330 million in May. The allocation in May was as follows: 230 million for national education, 60 million for secondary education, 6 million for vocational education, and 20 million for social education. Clearly, the majority of the funding is used for national education, which is a very correct policy.</p>
<p>The equipment and teaching conditions of all public schools are difficult to compare due to differences in nature and scale. In fact, apart from universities and vocational schools, the quality of a school and its ability to cultivate talent mainly depend on the quality of the teachers. Therefore, how to improve teachers' salaries so that they can have a stable life and focus on teaching is a pressing issue today.</p>
<h3>Eliminating "School Shops" - The Bosses Get Rich, the Teachers and Staff Suffer</h3>
<p>It is heartbreaking to say that in Shanghai, where everything is based on money, the education system, which has always been regarded as sacred, has also been distorted by "money." Noble schools have become commercialized "school shops."</p>
<p>This is a unique product of big cities!</p>
<p>Such School Shops</p>
<p>Rent a Shikumen house in an alleyway, use the living room as a large hall and classroom, the back building as an office, the side rooms as classrooms, exercise in the courtyard, and rent out the remaining drying platform. The principal is yourself, the accounting director is your wife (profits cannot be leaked), the general affairs director is your brother-in-law, and the guidance director is your own brother. Hire a tea server and a few female teachers who have just graduated or have not yet graduated, and the personnel aspect is complete. Students are of course recruited from outside, but there are preferential measures: a discount for each person who introduces a classmate to come along, and so on. Discipline can be slightly lenient, and those with poor grades only need to pay extra for tutoring after class. However, students must be responsible for cleaning the classroom every day to cultivate the habit of labor (in reality, even one tea server is too busy). Students are allowed to eat snacks, which are sold by the school's cooperative. Textbooks and workbooks are not allowed to be purchased outside, in order to ensure uniformity. This kind of alleyway primary school is the typical "school shop."</p>
<p>There is a type of cram school that offers many courses. Choosing one course costs tens of thousands of yuan. The slogan对外 is to recruit out-of-school students. Surprisingly, they even arrange special programs on the radio. In movie theaters, there are even more slideshow advertisements. This method of attracting students is not much different from the aggressive sales tactics of ordinary merchants. But it is said that many students are lured in. However, after paying a large tuition fee and attending one or two classes, they feel that it is not as "fascinating" as the advertisements said. As a result, they all withdraw one by one. Thus, the "school shop" owner's anticipated goal can be achieved.</p>
<p>Tuition Distribution</p>
<p>I remember that the Ministry of Education seems to have stipulated that 70% of the school's tuition revenue should be used for teachers' and staff salaries, and 30% should be used for other expenses within the school. Let us use this standard to explain the current operating situation of "school shops"!</p>
<p>Suppose the tuition revenue at the beginning of the semester is one million yuan, the clever "school shop" owner will cleverly utilize it. They may lend it out at high interest rates, or use it for speculation. Teachers' and staff salaries are paid at the end of each month, or even repeatedly delayed. The principal uses the monthly interest to pay teachers' and staff salaries. As for the 30% of school expenses, rent has not increased much compared to before the war, and the consumption of chalk and ink can be offset by the profits of the cooperative. Before the war, schools provided tea in the summer, but now we see that elementary school students bring their own bottles of water, which shows that some schools have even saved this expense.</p>
<p>With this calculation, the boss receives one million yuan at the beginning of the semester, and may still have one million yuan at the end of the semester, with not a single cent missing! If the speculation is successful, it may even be doubled several times.</p>
<p>However, there are also unlucky bosses. For example, the ×× primary and secondary school on Beijing Road failed in stock speculation and lost so much money that they could not even pay teachers' and staff salaries, which is very tragic.</p>
<p>Teachers Suffer</p>
<p>The "school shop" enriches the bosses, while the teachers and staff suffer. They are busy all day long, and have a high stack of papers to grade every day. However, what they earn each month is not enough to maintain their personal lives. Fortunately, the school recognizes their weaknesses and exclusively hires young, low-paid female teachers with family responsibilities or unqualified teachers. Even so, for the sake of their jobs, these poor teachers and staff have to curry favor with their superiors. For example, teachers and staff at a certain primary and secondary school on Ximen Road in this city have to give gifts to the affairs director (the principal's wife) during the New Year and holidays; otherwise, the boss may be rude to you!</p>
<p>In Shanghai, some schools entrust banks to collect tuition fees when school starts. There is also a mutually beneficial condition in this. The bank can immediately use this huge sum of money, but it must agree that the school can overdraw from the bank. This is also a great convenience for some "school shop" owners.</p>
<p>Severe Condemnation</p>
<p>However, it must be said that the emergence of "school shops" has its own objective environment. Shanghai has many school-age children, and the municipal and some well-performing private schools cannot accommodate so many people. Therefore, even if you open "school shops" one by one, you don't have to worry about customers coming to your door. Therefore, to eliminate the term "school shop," on the one hand, it is necessary to make those engaged in education recognize their own sacred and supreme mission. On the government's side, it should also strictly supervise and improve various private schools, and also set up more national schools to accommodate school-age children.</p>
<p>Of course, education is education, and business is business. It is not wrong for a school principal to operate another business. We will not only treat the school like a store, aiming solely to make money. We can only call it a "school shop" and condemn it severely without hesitation!</p>

<h3>School Survey - Provides Research Data for Educators at All Levels, a Reference for Parents Choosing Schools for Their Children, and a Guide for Students Pursuing Further Education</h3>
<p>We all know that there are many, many schools in Shanghai, but what is the total number? How many are municipal? How many are private? Which schools have a longer history and better facilities? How many schools were there before the war, and did the number increase or decrease after the war? How does the number of students compare?… These many questions may be something that people who are usually concerned about education would like to know but are difficult to investigate at one time. The reporter has collected information from various sources and made a more detailed statistics. With the great assistance of Shi Chongpeng, the section chief of the Statistics Section of the Education Bureau, the following table has been completed. If this can be used as part of the data for education researchers, a reference for parents when choosing schools for their children, and a guide for students pursuing further education, then the reporter will feel extremely relieved.</p>
<p>According to the numbers in the statistics above, we can know that the number of schools established after the war is almost double that of before the war, and the number of students has also increased by about one fold. The main reason for this phenomenon is naturally because the population was concentrated in Shanghai during the war. Most schools are not fully equipped, and because the school buildings are small, most schools implement a half-day system, with middle schools in the morning and primary schools in the afternoon. Naturally, there are many disadvantages. It is said that the education authorities have been prohibiting and eliminating it, but this is a social problem, and the half-day system is difficult to abolish before the housing shortage can be resolved.</p>
<p>During this war, the schools that suffered the greatest losses due to the destruction of school buildings were Wuben Girls' High School, Jingye Middle School, Aiguo Girls' High School, and Qixiu Girls' High School, etc. Almost nothing was moved out. It is indeed unknown how much difficulty they went through to re-establish the schools. The only comfort for these hard-working people is that the work of re-establishing the schools is relatively smooth, and the number of students has increased rather than decreased. Moreover, most of the students are old students, because most people are always conservative, and once they have faith in a certain school, they really do not want to transfer schools casually.</p>
<h3>The Earliest Public and Private Schools - Which Schools Have the Longest History</h3>
<p>Shanghai, after all, is a cultural center. There are about 1,050 public and private vocational, secondary, and primary schools. Among these many schools, which ones were the earliest to be established? The reporter can give readers a brief report here.</p>
<p>Public Schools</p>
<p>(1) The earliest public university to be established can be said to be National Jiaotong University - Jiaotong University was originally Nanyang Public School, founded by Sheng Xuanhuai in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty). It was approved by the imperial court to have the expenses issued annually by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the China Telegraph Administration. Later, it was renamed eight times in total, and it was not until the winter of the 17th year of the Republic of China that it was renamed Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>(2) The earliest secondary school to be established was Shanghai Guangfangyan Hall, which was approved by Jiangsu Governor Li Hongzhang in the 2nd year of the Tongzhi reign (Qing Dynasty) (49 years before the Republic of China) to study foreign languages. Students were selected from outstanding children under the age of 14 in the vicinity. In addition to foreign languages, the curriculum also included classics, history, and elementary school. At that time, the school was located in front of the old school. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, the Ministry of the Army named it the Military Industry Special School.</p>
<p>(3) The earliest municipal primary schools were established in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty). Three schools were established at the same time: Meixi Academy was renamed Meixi Primary School, Jingye was also renamed Jingye School from Jingye Painting Academy, and Yangzheng School was also established at the same time.</p>
<p>(4) The earliest teacher training school was the Teacher Training Institute established by Nanyang Public School, founded in the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign.</p>
<p>Private Schools</p>
<p>(1) The earliest university is St. John's University. The American Episcopal Church founded a school in Shanghai in the 25th year of the Daoguang reign (Qing Dynasty) (1845 AD), which was later renamed St. John's College, and was not renamed a university until the end of the Guangxu reign.</p>
<p>(2) The earliest secondary schools are Xuhui Public School and Qingxin Middle School.</p>
<p>(3) The earliest primary school is also the primary school attached to Xuhui Public School Middle School.</p>
<p>(4) The earliest private school for cultivating teachers was the Teacher Training Institute established by Xiang Wenrui and others, which was established around the 30th year of the Guangxu reign.</p>
<h3>The Door to Practical Knowledge - Technical Training Institutions - Remedial Schools</h3>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai's vocational remedial schools, the longer-established one can be said to be the China Vocational Remedial School attached to the China Vocational Education Society. This school had seven branches before the war, and only three schools remain now. The purpose of this remedial school is to teach practical knowledge and skills, train service ethics, and improve employment efficiency. Therefore, their organization is designed to consider the students in every way. Therefore, they are divided into morning classes, day classes, and evening classes, allowing students to choose their own free time and courses. After the decision is made, the school authorities will assign them to the corresponding level.</p>
<p>Fees</p>
<p>As for the fees, they are based on the subject units and levels. A small number of miscellaneous fees are also charged. In the first semester, each subject is 500 yuan for the second level and 2,700 yuan for the advanced level. It is said that starting from the next semester, the fees will be adjusted according to the regulations of the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Subjects</p>
<p>The current subjects include: university preparatory courses, business courses, women's remedial classes, Chinese and English typing courses, civil engineering specialty, Chinese shorthand courses, and adult literacy classes. The adult literacy classes are specially designed for those who are illiterate or slightly literate. As long as they bring their own books and lectures and pay a miscellaneous fee, everything is free.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students</p>
<p>It is said that in the spring semester of the 35th year, the number of students in the first school was about 1,000. On average, each student chose three subjects. Therefore, all seven classrooms were occupied from 7:10 a.m. to 9:20 p.m. without a break.</p>
<p>There are a total of 35 teachers and staff. They live in extreme busyness and tension every day. However, the remuneration they receive is 700 yuan per hour. If they have eight hours of classes a day, they will only earn 168,000 yuan a month. In fact, it is absolutely impossible for one person's energy to last for eight consecutive hours, not to mention that there are many papers to grade! Therefore, the current teacher salaries are really the thinnest.</p>
<p>Hope</p>
<p>Here, the reporter hopes that the school authorities can give adequate salaries that can provide a decent living to the poor teachers and staff in a reasonable proportion of all tuition and miscellaneous fees, and also hopes that the education authorities can provide a portion of the subsidies so that those who are truly educating for the sake of education will not be discouraged from changing careers. At the same time, they also hope that the government can pay attention to the importance of this type of remedial school and set up more of them throughout the country in the future to help those who already have jobs but still aspire to further their studies, giving them a chance to continue their studies diligently.</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Education Bureau Inspects the Central National School in the Sixteenth District</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Director Gu and Deputy Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau have been inspecting various schools throughout the city in recent days, giving instructions on improving various aspects. They have also recorded this in this newspaper. It is now heard that the two directors visited the Central National School in the Sixteenth District of Hongkou again the day before yesterday, staying for two hours. They expressed great satisfaction with the school's re-establishment work and gave very detailed instructions on the method of adding grades in the next semester.</p>
<p>Education in our country has always been considered backward. Shanghai is different because it is a city. However, most families still do not regard their children's education expenses as a necessary expense. A friend told me a story about his childhood schooling. In order to buy a pencil, he asked his mother for three copper coins, but what he got was not money, but a scolding. Most parents are like this. They regard their children's tuition as an unnecessary burden, especially if it is spent on girls.</p>
<p>After the victory, this phenomenon has not changed, mainly because life is still so oppressive that parents cannot breathe. If an average family has three children in school, their parents will not be able to bear the burden. This semester has ended, and after a two-month summer vacation, the new semester will begin. How many parents are starting to worry about their children's tuition fees for the next semester!</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine the amount of tuition fees two months before the start of the semester, but we may as well first review the amount of tuition fees for the past semester. At that time, the various private universities and church universities originally set the fees at 45,000 yuan, except for St. John's University, which set the fees at 75,000 yuan, to be paid in two installments of 45,000 and 30,000 yuan. 75,000 yuan was a considerable amount of money half a year ago, but when paying the second installment, it seemed that the amount of 30,000 yuan was not very large. Due to the soaring prices, other universities also increased their fees one after another. At that time, the tuition fees for universities were probably between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Private middle schools also pay fees in two installments. The first installment for high school is 12,000 yuan for tuition and 4,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; the first installment for junior high school is 9,000 yuan for tuition and 3,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees, and it is stipulated that the second installment cannot exceed the first installment. However, that is just a general example. As far as the reporter knows, some of the more aristocratic middle schools charge quite high fees. For example, the high school fees for Yuying, Xuhui, Jinke, and Peicheng are all around 40,000 yuan, and the junior high school fees are all around 35,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tuition Review</h3>
<p>Generally, private primary schools charge tuition in two installments. The first installment is about six thousand yuan for tuition and two thousand yuan for miscellaneous fees. Regulations state that the second installment cannot exceed the first, but some schools charge around twenty thousand yuan. What about tuition for the next semester? Although not yet determined, it is said there is already a "rough estimate." Church universities charge around three hundred thousand yuan, secondary schools range from a high of two hundred and twenty thousand to a low of sixty to seventy thousand yuan, and primary schools range from a high of one hundred thousand to a low of twenty to thirty thousand yuan. Should we criticize these figures? The problem lies in the unstable prices. After February, school authorities will have another view of the tuition amounts. Tuition fees, for universities, are about forty to sixty yuan, for secondary schools, about twenty-five to forty yuan, and for primary schools, about ten to fifteen yuan. If calculated based on rice prices, the "rough estimates" mentioned above may not seem excessive. However, education and school authorities should not ignore the following phenomena: 1. The current economic situation is not stable and cannot be compared to the pre-war period; pre-war schools had more perfect equipment. 2. Regarding education laws and teachers, current schools, whether in equipment or faculty, inevitably have to make do with what they have; 3. The war has created great wealth and abject poverty, with too great a difference between the rich and the poor; this means there are more poor people after the war than before, and it is more difficult for most people to afford tuition; 4. Teachers' salaries are fundamentally worse than before the war; 5. Various expenditures and expenses of school authorities are more economical than before the war; 6. Most schools still operate on a half-day schedule.</p>
<p>We do not want to prescribe a supposedly fair tuition amount here. However, based on the above six points, school authorities absolutely cannot use rice prices or anything else as a standard to measure pre-war and post-war tuition amounts. Our point is that, in order to save Chinese education and students, the "rough estimates" mentioned above are certainly too high.</p>

<h3>National Dignity</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Readers, please do not treat the following story as a myth.</p>
<p>Due to the issue of German nationals evacuating, Rundell of the Associated Press had a dispute with Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because of this dispute, the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drawn our attention.</p>
<p>What kind of organization is it? What is happening behind the scenes?</p>
<p>Including the director, it now has thirty employees, and its monthly expenses are two hundred and eighty thousand yuan. As it represents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shanghai sees people coming and going almost every day, two hundred and eighty thousand yuan is said to be insufficient even for telephone expenses.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the office has hosted guests twice. Once was a cocktail party held on the fourteenth floor of the International Hotel, inviting consular officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai and people from all walks of life in Shanghai. That bill amounted to nearly half a year's expenses and has not yet been approved; it is temporarily recorded in the books. The other time was when the Siamese delegation arrived in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly instructed them to entertain them properly. So, they hosted two tables at the New Life Club, totaling three hundred thousand yuan. The reimbursement claim was returned three times. The last time, they were instructed to have the guests who accompanied them sign the bill to prove it, because the entire Siamese delegation only had seven members, so why were two tables of guests needed? Therefore, the accompanying guests had to sign to prove it.</p>
<p>The staff often has to worry about meal expenses. Fortunately, there is still income from passport and visa fees. Today, three were signed, bringing in fifteen thousand yuan, which is enough for buying side dishes. Tomorrow, four will be signed, bringing in twenty thousand yuan, so meal expenses are not a problem.</p>
<p>The director dares not go out, dares not socialize, partly because his clothing is not presentable (he certainly doesn't have formal attire), partly because the old car often breaks down midway, and partly because he doesn't have money to reciprocate, and can't keep eating other people's food.</p>
<p>This is the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is a thousand percent true.</p>
<p>When we usually hear the words "diplomatic personnel," what kind of associations come to mind? What about after you read the brief report above? A friend in the Shanghai court said to the people in this office: "In terms of poverty, you are first, we are second. We are slightly better off than you!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Song said at a press conference: Under the torment of the current high prices and cost of living, the most virtuous people are those who complain. So, the people in this office are all complaining, but their complaint is: "Please preserve the national dignity!"</p>
<h3>I Fear Doctors</h3>
<p>— Chu Lantian</p>
<p>I long for the medical profession; however, I fear them.</p>
<p>The distribution of doctors is very uneven. In general small towns, most sell medicine while practicing medicine. Although they have a fixed address, they still carry the air of a "traveling medicine man." As for the vast countryside, doctors are as rare as stars in the morning. But this profession appears particularly developed in cities. As for Shanghai, it seems to have exceeded the saturation point, as we can guess from the year-round doctor advertisements.</p>
<p>In addition to the family-inherited doctors, Confucian doctors, and old men filled with "Golden Cabinet" and "Treatise on Cold Damage" knowledge, there are also many newly emerging, quickly-trained doctors in the countryside. They mostly treat medicine as a sideline, a jack-of-all-trades, as the saying goes, "once you put down the rake, you have no broom." Internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, everything is available, as well as acupuncture - injections. Speaking of injections, let me tell you something. A certain doctor, when injecting into a patient's veins, must first burn three incense sticks to show that the great task is accomplished. You must think it strange, right? No, no, in the remote countryside, there is also a medical treatment method involving drawing lots! One person copies various prescriptions into a notebook. When a patient comes, they randomly flip to a page and use that as the prescription. This kind of funny and absurd man-made immortal method of treating diseases is still prevalent in our world!</p>
<p>The small plants on my younger sister's grave are thicker than my arm, but I can't help but blame our country doctor for her [demise]. Her illness came on very slowly, taking about a month. It was a kind of edema. Perhaps it wasn't a terminal illness in medical terms, but because the war was not yet over, transportation was obstructed, and as a result, she only had to drink dozens of doses of bitter medicine and finally died. What's most pitiful is that when she finally closed her eyes, there was still a doctor there to see her off! This old gentleman did not diagnose the patient's rapid death. He watched his medical experimenter die!</p>
<p>Doctors in the city are very advanced. They have a theoretical basis and scientific surgery. Naturally, there are no legendary strange stories in the field of Chinese medicine, and there is no shortage of masters. Not only that, but there are also many large-scale hospitals for collective treatment. Logically, it should be fortunate to get sick in the city, right? But that's not the case!</p>
<p>A month or two ago, my mother suddenly had abdominal pain and diarrhea after midnight, which was very much like cholera, but at that time, the roads were under curfew, the doctors were sleeping, and the hospital wouldn't open the door. Helpless, she could only eat some Ren Dan and Ten Drops Water-like things. Waiting until dawn, I quickly hired a car to take her to the hospital, got an emergency registration, and waited until eight o'clock before I carried her into the internal medicine clinic and put her on the sickbed. The doctor looked at the registration form and asked me:</p>
<p>"What's her illness?"</p>
<p>I roughly explained the symptoms, and he got up and pressed his hands on my mother's abdomen for a few moments, checking the pulse on both sides for less than a minute. The diagnosis was considered complete. I asked him if it was cholera? He replied, "Hmm –" He replied again, "Hmm –" and then went back to writing his prescription, and instructed me: "Take this to get the medicine, take it and then come back. If it's an epidemic, you must be hospitalized!" Heavens, how would I know if it's an epidemic? He just "hmm"-ed twice. More patients continued to come in, so I had no choice but to carry my mother out again. For the sake of caution, I settled my mother in a wooden seat in the corridor. I planned to complete the hospitalization procedures. Who knew that the third class was full, and the second class required an upfront payment of three hundred thousand yuan and also required a guarantor? This blocked all my courage. Thank goodness, after being busy for half a day, my mother's stomachache stopped, and the diarrhea also stopped. "Let's go back, Lan'er. It's more convenient to have tea and water at home!" I carried my mother again and called a car to go home.</p>
<p>Really, as if by a miracle, after being touched by that doctor; after lying on that sickbed for only a few minutes, without taking any medicine, she got better. Its magic is no less than the great medicine vat "West Market Attractant" of the Song Dynasty, magical to the point that drinking dye vat water could also cure the disease.</p>
<p>After recuperating for two or three days, my mother gradually got better, and I couldn't help but feel sentimental about it. "If I had waited for that doctor to treat my illness, I'm afraid I would have reached the Looking-Homeward Terrace by now?"</p>
<p>This is why I fear doctors, whether in the countryside, in Shanghai, or even anywhere.</p>
<h3>Spider</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Among all the small creatures in the world, spiders are probably the most misunderstood and slandered by humans. Flies and mosquitoes are much more terrible, but women only feel a little disgusted when they see them; when they see spiders, they scream. Of course, the "Black Widow" (a type of spider) has brought a bad name to its kind, but even it is not as black as it is in pictures!</p>
<p>In fact, spiders can be said to be friends of mankind. For centuries, they have waged war against insects, protecting mankind and resisting the all-out attacks of insects. The insects captured by spiderwebs include many pests that spread plagues and destroy crops. But what is the reward that spiders receive? Persecution!</p>
<p>In addition to their outstanding contributions to mankind, spiders also have great talents. The webs they weave have countless uses. They use them to build bridges, to transmit messages, and to make highways. After building a web, they will use a single thread to construct a bridge leading to a secret strategic location – where they also have a home. Spiders, like fishermen, patiently wait for insects to come to their doom.</p>
<p>There are many types of spiders, and the webs they weave each have different ingenious designs. Orange spiders weave meandering webs. Grass spiders weave webs shaped like tunnels, with a lifesaver route underneath, for a quick escape in case of emergency. White-shelled spiders can freely turn yellow, and then turn back to white. Trapdoor spiders dig holes in the ground, and use silk to create a door on top. It requires a pound of pulling force to open this silk door. Freshwater spiders breathe air but live in water.</p>
<p>So, please remember, you should treat them with kindness and respect. They are thrifty little animals, and they are also great allies of mankind in the war against harmful insects!</p>
<h3>Postponement</h3>
<p>— Bi Yue</p>
<p>Zhang: Lao Wang, you borrowed the money the day before yesterday. It's time to return it to me today, right?</p>
<p>Wang: I'm sorry, can you please extend it for a few days?</p>
<p>Zhang: No, you promised me that day and clearly told me to come to you today to get it. What reason do you have for postponing it? You promised me!</p>
<p>Wang: I'm really sorry, the ceasefire order has been extended by eight days. Can't we postpone this little thing for a few days? Lao Zhang! I'm sorry!</p>

<h3>"America Also Has Black Markets"</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In American magazines, beer advertisements are always labeled with the words "moderate drink." But now, it has become an important item in the American black market. Its position is the same as that of meat, butter, and other items that are in short supply. Since the US government explicitly ordered it, merchants who manufacture beer have reduced the amount of grain used in accordance with the order. However, the black market does not become slack due to the reduction in quality. On the contrary, public places and nightclubs are willing to pay $20 for half a barrel of beer, while in the legal market, it can be purchased for only $9. But public places start their night business in the evening, and the beer black market also starts with it, earlier than the legal rationing time, otherwise customers will be reduced. And the authorities who stabilize prices have no way to extinguish this, because although rationing beer is limited to individuals buying it in person, the distributors often ignore that the buyers take it for public or private use.</p>
<p>In the United States, the black market for meat is even more rampant. Chicago, the center of the slaughter industry, has a more thriving meat black market than other places. The Daily News there pointed out that the black market for liquor today is like a peanut compared to the black market for meat. One method for the meat black market is for sellers to sell to people who want more than the amount specified on the ration card at prices exceeding the official price. When packaging, they pack it especially small, so that people see that the meat inside does not exceed the officially set amount. New York meat merchants have seen that this summer, housewives will not be able to buy meat except from the black market, and the situation will be worse than during the war. In New York City alone, 90% of all meat is currently purchased from the black market. And when housewives buy meat, they pay the money and dare not ask how much it weighs per pound, for fear that the police will see it and not allow the purchase, leaving them with no meat to eat. Large slaughterhouses accuse small slaughterhouses of having too many numbers. For example, in New York City, on a certain day in March this year, large slaughterhouses slaughtered 8,936 pigs and cattle, while small slaughterhouses also slaughtered 7,137. The meat of small slaughterhouses is, of course, mostly sold in the black market. So, if the situation does not improve, in the near future, all meat will be sold entirely on the black market.</p>
<p>In addition to beer and meat, other foods also have black markets. For example, in New York, ham costs 40 cents per pound at the official price, but 85 or 90 cents on the black market. In Cleveland, beef costs 53 cents per pound at the official price, but 70 cents on the black market. A merchant in Boston bought butter for 75 cents per pound and sold it for a dollar. In the past few months, he made a lot of money. Many unwanted vegetables are sold along with other items, mostly potatoes. A housewife in New York, in order to buy a pound of onions, ended up buying more potatoes and tomatoes. Residents of Philadelphia buy at least 50 pounds of sugar every day from the black market. The official price is 7 cents per pound, but the black market price is 20 to 25 cents. Undoubtedly, part of the rationed food is smuggled and sold on the black market!</p>
<h3>Inferiority and Superiority</h3>
<p>— Gui Ting</p>
<p>"Psychological Complex" at work Gui Ting</p>
<p>Inferiority and superiority are originally very normal, but sometimes one shouldn't feel inferior but subconsciously feels inferior, or one shouldn't feel superior but subconsciously feels superior. This is an abnormal psychological state. It is the result of what psychologists call a "Psychological Complex" at work.</p>
<p>A "Psychological Complex" is a special psychological state hidden in the subconscious. According to the most advanced psycho-analysis, the formation of this abnormal psychological state is related to an individual's childhood life, especially regarding the sexual aspect (the famous psychologist Freud advocated this). There are many types of these states, in addition to the inferiority complex and superiority complex, there are also mixed feelings of inferiority and superiority, feelings of persecution, feelings of guilt, feelings of transferred hatred, etc.</p>
<p>Inferiority complex is a problem that ordinary people, especially young people with neurasthenia, are most prone to. In any situation, especially when encountering tense scenes or in a large crowd, they always feel flushed and uneasy. Sometimes they want to say something, but they stammer and can't utter it; sometimes even their hands don't obey commands, and automatically play the pipa. At that time, they really wish there was a hole in the ground that they could immediately disappear into. People suffering from an inferiority complex are truly pitiful. No matter what, they always feel that they are inferior to others in every way. This psychology will of course have a serious impact on their career development.</p>
<p>Recent psychoanalysis has made great progress and has discovered methods to correct the inferiority complex. A book written by a psychology professor at the University of Paris named "Personal Magnetism" lists some simple treatments. The most common is to guide the patient on how to enhance their own "magnetism," and every morning, facing the mirror, repeatedly tell their reflection the following sentences in a strong tone: "I am your master," "I am stronger than you at all times," "I command you to do this, you must obey me." … Over time, it can enhance one's self-confidence and overcome the inferiority complex. It seems like doing this is like joking. However, the results of the experiment have unexpected effects.</p>
<p>The most obvious example of superiority complex is Hitler's megalomania. This manic psychological state hypnotized himself, so all his words and deeds were controlled by the power of his self-hypnosis. So, as soon as he went on stage, he would rant on and on, gesturing wildly. At that time, he even felt that he himself was Germany, the entire Aryan race, and even God controlling the entire universe. Such megalomania can be said to have developed to its highest peak, and in the end destroyed himself and destroyed Germany. This is indeed the most dangerous and most difficult to treat disease!</p>
<p>There is also another type of person who originally has an inferiority complex. Precisely because of this, they desperately use various methods to cover up their weaknesses, and on the other hand, they engage in behaviors that harm others for their own benefit, or even behaviors that are not beneficial to themselves. Those with severe illnesses may develop into criminals. Most of the bandits who commit murder and arson, and the swindlers who take wealth by fraud, belong to this category.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of World War II, according to the survey by American psychoanalysts, they discovered many examples of mental disorders, whether deep or shallow. Believe it or not, during this war, 850,000 soldiers had to be sent to hospitals for treatment due to mental disorders, and there were also many disputes among civilians caused by the same reasons. These examples can be roughly divided into several types: feelings of persecution, feelings of guilt, and feelings of transferred hatred. The reasons why these abnormal psychologies are formed are roughly:</p>
<p>(1) The housing shortage makes many people feel very uneasy in their minds, and they often get angry and fly into a rage;</p>
<p>(2) The cancellation of leave in times of emergency leads to extreme fatigue and tension;</p>
<p>(3) The war has increased people's hatred of each other;</p>
<p>(4) Parents' control over children has been relaxed due to the war, resulting in the habit of barbaric behavior in the next generation;</p>
<p>(5) Killing people on the battlefield is blamed on conscience, so they always feel that they have committed a crime and cannot get rid of it;</p>
<p>(6) Various unfortunate events that occurred during the battlefield period made it impossible for the person's hatred to be vented, resulting in it being transferred to others.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue of the "psychological complex" occupies an extremely important position in modern medicine and criminology. In the United States, there are a total of more than 3,500 mental therapy experts. As for our country, I heard that Peking Union Medical College used to have this department, but it is not very clear how well they did. However, we are still considered fortunate, because we still have national spiritual therapy experts such as Zhang Tianshi and Tibetan lamas to save us some face.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour</h3>
<p>— Yan An</p>
<p>A few days ago, I heard a friend say that they got diarrhea from eating the free, rationed milk powder. I was a bit skeptical because such a phenomenon might occur if the milk powder wasn't mixed properly or never boiled. Moreover, the milk powder came from America, so the quality should be good. Recently, my son's school also distributed two pounds of milk powder. I was especially cautious, not only mixing it well but also boiling it in a pot. To prevent my child from getting sick, I tasted it first. When I ate it, a layer of very fine white substance settled to the bottom, and the top looked like a layer of clear water. What's even stranger is that when I first mixed it, it seemed to ferment and increase in volume. When I tasted it, I could detect undissolved flour particles, and the taste wasn't like the Klim milk powder we usually eat. What exactly is this stuff? Could the Americans be deceiving us? What exactly is going on? I hope someone can tell us.</p>
<p>A week ago, the neighborhood chief told me that each household could receive flour. In these times of expensive rice and firewood, hearing about flour was like finding a treasure—how exciting! The next day, I prepared a flour sack and went to the neighborhood chief's place. The neighborhood chief said, "This matter was the village head's doing; he asked me to notify you, but I'm not distributing the flour. Please ask the village head." So, I hurried to the village head's place, but the village head seemed to have no idea about the matter. He was a bit stunned. After a while, he replied, "Since the neighborhood chief notified you, go ask him!" I had no choice but to silently pack up my empty sack and walk back under the scorching sun. Silently, because in these eight years, I've been in the occupied zone and developed a servile nature. Now, although I've been helped by others and finally achieved victory, my servile nature hasn't been liberated. Seeing the current village head, I didn't dare to say much. However, I still don't understand: if nothing was going to happen, why bother making a special announcement?</p>
<p>Indeed, there are too many strange things in the great Republic of China for a small citizen to understand!</p>

<h3>Letter to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Feng:</p>
<p>It's been a whole month since you left me. In this month, I feel like I've lost my soul, just wandering around the garden, dazed, not knowing what to do. I see the lush flowers and trees everywhere, swaying in the wind, but I can't see your thin figure. I shout your name at the top of my voice, but I only hear the birds singing on the branches, and I can't hear your clear, bell-like response. Ah! Where did you go? Where did you go?</p>
<p>Thinking back, we've been married for twenty-nine years and have never been separated for so long. There's a line in an ancient poem, "Counting the nights of reunion by the pillow, except for being away from home, we've always been together." That's exactly how we were. Moreover, I never traveled far, always staying with you. The only time I was "away from home" was one year when I traveled to Huangshan with Chen Dingshan and his wife for ten days. You didn't go with me, but we missed each other so much during those ten days. During the Anti-Japanese War, our family returned to Shanghai from Anhui. Every spring and autumn, I had to return to Suzhou alone to visit this dilapidated home. Then we had short periods of separation, three or four days at least, seven or eight days at most. And there was one time when the demons of 76 Jessfield Road were rampant, and Mr. Wang, the manager of Shen Bao who lived with us in Xiangzhuang, was taken away. Manager Ma rushed to pick me up in a car to stay at the newspaper office for ten consecutive days, making you worried for ten days. Apart from that, it was almost always "nights of reunion" and "always together." Who knew that this time you would quietly leave me, leave me for a whole month without coming back, leaving me alone and longing for you! Ah! Where did you go? Where did you go?</p>
<p>When I wandered around until I was exhausted and returned to the temporary parlor in the wooden shed, I saw at a glance the snow-white altar, white candles, white lanterns, white table coverings, and white mourning couplets. I saw your spirit tablet, your portrait. My tear ducts burst, and I cried out loud. I knew, I knew that you had died, that you had gone to another world and would never return! Alas! I remember when you were sick, you held my hand, with tears in your eyes, and said to me very sincerely, "Dear, I can't live without you, and you can't live without me!" Your words are still ringing in my ears, but you hardened your heart and left forever. Of course, I can't live without you, I'll never be able to live without you. Could it be that you can live without me, that's why you left me without looking back?</p>
<p>Speaking of your health, although you weren't very strong, you never suffered from any serious illness, and you never went to the hospital. However, every summer you suffered from "quansha" (summer fatigue), your body would feel hot, and your appetite would be poor, so your food intake would decrease. But by autumn, you would recover. Who knew that this year's "quansha" came especially early. The symptoms were the same as in previous years, but you didn't care and continued to get up at dawn every day and work as busy as usual. Although you took some Chinese medicine, it didn't seem to help much. I advised you to rest, but you refused to listen, saying that "quansha" was a yearly occurrence and would get better after summer. This time, the "quansha" lasted especially long, until after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The fever finally subsided, and your appetite gradually improved. However, you were still thin and hadn't recovered. I advised you to see a doctor and take medicine, but you declined out of concern for my finances, saying that you would gain weight naturally as long as you could eat. In the last ten days of the twelfth lunar month, I returned to Suzhou. You were busy with all kinds of preparations for the New Year, grinding flour, steaming rice cakes, spring cleaning, and you exhausted yourself for several days. When I returned to Shanghai, you were already sick in bed. You took Chinese medicine, but the fever didn't go down. Zheng got anxious and hurriedly invited his good friend, Western medicine doctor Cheng Zulin, to examine you. After examining you, he said that there was a problem with your lungs and that you had to have an X-ray. So, the next day, I insisted that you go to get one, and I asked Ling to accompany you to the lung sanatorium. You reluctantly agreed, still not believing that you had lung disease because although you coughed sometimes when you caught a cold, you had never coughed up blood. The next day, Zheng brought back the X-ray, and it shocked me. The X-ray showed some shadows on both your left and right lung apices, confirming that you were suffering from that most cursed lung disease. Dr. Cheng comforted me, saying that the disease isn't as serious in middle-aged people as it is in young people. As long as you take good care of yourself, there's hope for a complete recovery. He first prescribed some antipyretic and appetite-stimulating drugs, asking you to take them three times a day. Then he bought vitamin B, vitamin C, and calcium injections, a total of more than sixty injections, preparing to return to Suzhou to inject them, because we had already decided to move back to our old home in Suzhou after the Lantern Festival.</p>
<h3>Sex Education for Girls in Puberty</h3>
<p>— Yan Juan</p>
<p>(1) During Menstruation</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, her sexual organs develop fully, and menstruation begins. During this period, the most important thing a mother should do is to tell her daughter how to handle it and pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>The hygiene of menstruation, simply put, is to keep clean, because at this time, the sexual organs are congested, the epithelium of the uterus sheds, and there are small wounds inside the uterus. Germs can easily breed in the menstrual blood, so local cleaning is very important. But it is best to wash the outside and not take a bath.</p>
<p>At the same time, the spirit is very uneasy at this time, and how to make the spirit calm is also very important.</p>
<p>(2) Sexual Hygiene for Virgins</p>
<p>Generally, parents pay great attention to the hygiene of their children; but they let go of a girl who has reached puberty, which is really wrong. In fact, during this period, changes are most likely to occur in a girl's body and mind throughout her life, so she should be paid more attention than a child.</p>
<p>At the age of puberty, whether male or female, it is not suitable to eat stimulating foods, especially for girls. Because stimulating things can cause sexual desire and make the genitals congested, thus causing "masturbation."</p>
<p>Secondly, pay attention to sleep time. Sleep time and appearance have a deep relationship. If sleep is insufficient, the face will show a tense look, and beauty will be destroyed. Girls must have adequate sleep to make their spirits happy and give the body a good influence. Generally, young women often indulge in reading novels and stay up late, which is already inappropriate. What's more, after reading a novel, they fall asleep and imagine all kinds of fantasies, which causes sexual desire and even leads to "masturbation," which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>During virginity, there is one more thing to pay attention to, which is "homosexual love," which is as harmful as "masturbation," and once you fall into it, it is difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>The reasons for this bad habit are nothing more than the influence of bad friends and bad circumstances. Female workers in factories and female students in schools often have homosexual love affairs. A virgin in puberty will unconsciously ask for a partner, but if she asks for an opposite-sex partner, she is afraid that society will criticize her, so she becomes close to the same sex and falls into homosexual love. In this case, it is best for the mother and sister to speak frankly and openly with her to help her get out of it. This is the best way.</p>
<p>(3) Sexual Organ Diseases</p>
<p>The causes of sexual organ diseases in virginity are mostly due to poor health during menstruation, or "masturbation," or due to congenital diseases, or due to weak physique.</p>
<p>Generally, people think that women's sexual organ diseases only occur after marriage, which is wrong. And it is also wrong for young women to be ashamed to ask a doctor for treatment after having a sexually transmitted disease for the above reasons. You should know that this kind of disease or sexual organ abnormality in virginity has a great impact on future married life, and both parents and the person themselves must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>In short, the most important thing for the sexual organ hygiene of virgins are the two words "cleanliness," because this part and the urinary organs are often moist, and if they are not clean, it is easy to cause vulvitis, and because grape-shaped bacteria are easy to adhere to the mucous membrane and reproduce, inflammation can also occur.</p>
<h3>This hairstyle is most suitable for beaches or tennis courts. The bun hanging on the neck has a rustic charm. The hair in the front is brushed back and tied in the middle with a hair band, so that it will not be scattered even in a strong wind.</h3>
<h3>If you want shiny hair, this style is the most suitable. The hair at the back is curled inward, and with the help of white hairpins, the hair in the front maintains a soft wavy undulation.</h3>
<h3>Training Children</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Xing</p>
<p>Playing with a wooden truck together</p>
<p>I have two brothers who often quarrel over playing with that wooden truck, so they often argue, but my father can't afford to buy a new one so that they each have one. What should I do?</p>
<p>So one night, my father said, "You often quarrel over this truck. Now I'm going to stipulate that you take turns playing with it for a week, but during that week, the person playing with it has to carry firewood to the kitchen to fill the wood box. The person who doesn't have a turn can do whatever game they like."</p>
<p>At first, they thought this agreement was very fair, but soon they found that it was too lonely to work and play alone, so they started playing together again, working together every day to carry firewood to the kitchen. From then on, they no longer quarreled over the wooden truck.</p>
<p>Here is a hairstyle that can be used in a summer night palace. The small braid tied on the top of the head has an artificial beauty. A curve of hair hangs to the back of the head, and four flowers add to the charm. This hairstyle shows a mixed style of girl and lady.</p>
<h3>Science Proves the Greatness of Motherly Love</h3>
<p>— Liu Zongwen</p>
<p>Usually, when we praise the greatness of motherly love, we often only have a vague concept.</p>
<p>Now, with the progress of science, it has been proven that motherly love is indeed great.</p>
<p>Dr. Bran of the National Mental Health Association in the United States said: Infants who receive sufficient maternal affection often start speaking earlier.</p>
<p>Dr. Baudemeck's research on delinquent teenagers proves that every child who cannot adapt to the social environment lacks a harmonious relationship with their parents in childhood.</p>
<p>The results of experiments at New York's Brifford Hospital prove that sick children who are cared for by their mothers or "surrogate mothers" recover more easily.</p>
<p>Dr. Hayes in the United States ran a nursery and used scientific methods to test it. The results proved that infants who are loved and caressed gain weight more easily and are less likely to get sick.</p>
<p>These scientific facts fully prove the need and greatness of motherly love.</p>
<h3>A Box on the Fireplace</h3>
<p>A friend of mine, who has eight children, often encounters children asking him for money to buy what they need, and he often has to deal with it. Later, he came up with a rule and said to the children: "If you want to buy something, tell me first, and I will put the money you need in the box on the fireplace, but you must not touch it for a week. If after a week you still feel you need that thing so much, you can take the money out of the box to buy what you need. If your need for that thing diminishes after a week, you can take the money out of the box and deposit it in the bank."</p>
<p>This rule has been implemented since they were children and turned into adults, and their bank deposits have also increased to a considerable amount as they grew older, so the things they bought were also more valuable.</p>

<h3>The Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas and the Musicians of Wuxi</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>"Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" was compiled by Zou Jin of Wuxi. He himself was from Wuxi, so the musicians he associated with were mostly from Wuxi. Therefore, many of the musicians in this book are from Wuxi, and some are from Changzhou near Wuxi. We read Zhou Hui's "Jinling Locked Affairs" and Gu Qiyuan's "Guest Seat Anecdotes" of Jiangning, and we know that most of what is described are musicians from Nanjing; it is the same now. In Zou Jin's "Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" of Wuxi, most of what is included are musicians from Wuxi or Changzhou near Wuxi.</p>
<p>"Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" contains thirty-four volumes, one drama per volume. Volume five is Zou Dui Jin's "Empty Hall Talk." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 40, Miscellaneous Records, records an anecdote about Zou Dui Jin: "Zou Shujie Dui Jin went north to Beijing in the year of Ding Chou of Chongzhen. When crossing the river and anchoring at Jinshan, a strong wind arose. Shujie saw a boat capsizing, waved his hand and shouted for help, and went out to rescue with gold. Many people competed to row boats and saved eleven people and recovered nineteen dead bodies. He also donated three hundred taels to set up more than twenty lifeboats, called red boats. To this day, those who are good at doing good follow his example. Shujie sold out his assets and returned home, never taking the exam again. His son is Zou Zhongyi, who was selected for the Hanlin Academy." According to the same book, scroll 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, Zou Zhongyi wrote "Snow Banana Collection."</p>
<p>Volume twenty-nine is Sun Yuanwen's "Starving Dongfang Shuo." Jiao Xun's "Drama Theory," Volume 3, says: "I have always regretted that the songs of the Yuan people did not involve the affairs of Dongfang Manqian, or that they existed but were not passed down. Yang Shen'an of the Ming Dynasty had a scene of cutting meat to leave to his wife, and Mao Xiaoruo wrote "Rebutting Dong Zhongshu's Affairs," both based on official history. Only Sun Yuanwen's "Starving Dongfang Shuo" in four acts, with the Queen Mother of the West as the master, and Sima Qian, Bu Shi, Li Ling, Zhong Jun, and Lady Li as the main characters, is the most authentic, with a tragic and generous spirit residing in the jokes and illusions." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 23, Loyal and Righteous, Biography of Sun Yuanwen, says: "Sun Yuanwen, courtesy name Nangong, the youngest son of Ji Gao, a student, had the utmost sincerity, loved drinking, and loved reading. He had read all of the classics, histories, and hundreds of schools. His frame was short, and he took in ancient clothes and crowns. He spoke generously about the affairs of the world, or the successes and failures of ancient and modern times, and exhausted their sources. In the seventeenth year of Chongzhen, he heard that the capital had fallen and the emperor had died for the country; Yuanwen wept day and night. When he heard the poem "Geese" in the autumn, he wrote: "I lived in Jiangnan when I was young and did not hear the mourning of the geese. Tonight, clear tears on my pillow, I know you came from the old capital." Before long, he coughed up blood between the stools, and died when the tears were exhausted. In the forty-first year of Qianlong, he was granted admission to the Shrine of Loyalty and Righteousness." Also, in the same book, Volume 39, Sun Yuanwen wrote "Sunny Day Clogs" and "Stupid Nunnery Collection."</p>
<p>Sun Yuanwen's good friend was Huang Jiashu. Volume 30 of the Miscellaneous Drama Compilations records Huang Jiashu's "Chengnan Temple." The "Little Records of Tin More Knowledge" (preface dated Qianlong 17th year, compiled by Huang Hong) Volume 14, Listening to the Seventeen Sons Club, says: "Corresponding to the Jisha and Fushe from afar, there is a jointly engraved "Manuscripts of the Seventeen Sons Society" that is circulated in the world." Among the surnames of the seventeen sons, Huang Hanchen Jiashu is one of them. The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 26, says: "Huang Jiashu, courtesy name Hanchen. He was known as a talented student from a young age, and was good friends with Sun Yuanwen. After the change of Jia Shen, Yuanwen died for the festival, and Jiashu abandoned his student clothes. He sat and slept in a small room, refusing to associate with others, and named his collection the Wen Tang Collection to show his ambition. Song Zhi Pu, the prefect, heard his name and wanted to invite him, but he could not. His body was thin and he abandoned himself due to illness. He cultivated silence and had no son. His disciple Ma Hong engraved his posthumous writings, and Su Songling wrote the preface." The same book, Volume 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, records his "Yanwen Tang Collection" in ten volumes and "Records of Southern Loyalty." Volume 37 records his prose "Records of the Ancestral Hall of the Three Dukes Ouyang Lin and Zeng," which contains the sentence: "The eunuch stole the power, and the three dukes and Donglin began and ended it." Volume 33 records his poem "Passing by the Old Residence of Zhao Zifang," which says: "I remember the past when I struck the building and sang sadly, the birds cry and the moon falls and the wine is full of urns. I regret the road to Xizhou, and the tiger and yellow are empty with the thoughts of Beihai. The pond house still exists but the books are scattered, the clothes and crowns are not old, and the swallows come late. Tian Guang beheaded himself and Jing Ke died, lonely west wind crying for Jianli." Volume 40 Miscellaneous Records says: "Huang Hanchen was on good terms with Sun Ben'an. When Ben'an died for the festival, Hanchen had a letter to Zhang Qiushao saying: "My brother and Ben'an spoke across the river, and their worries were visible in their faces. Ben'an died for the country as expected. As for me, a weak body, still living in the world, eating half a bowl of coarse rice, I don't think I will last long. Only you, brother, pay attention to the literature of my county, which is really reliable. Jiashu wrote while lying sick."</p>
<p>Volume thirty-two is Du Tingqin's "Hygienic Talisman." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 16, Election Table, Du Ting's, in the second year of Shunzhi, was a Jinshi in the year of Ding Hai. Also, Volume 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, has his "Jinlan Collection."</p>
<p>Volume thirty-four is Zou Jin's own "Romantic Tomb." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 16, Election Table, in the sixth year of Tianqi, says that he was a Jinshi in the year of Geng Chen.</p>
<p>Volume twenty-seven is Xue Dan's "Zhaojun Dream." Xue Dan was of course also from Wuxi. The Wujin Yanghu County Chronicle records a wealthy man named Xue Dan, but his name and deeds are not similar, so he should be a different person.</p>
<p>Volume twenty-eight is Zhang Longwen's "Qiting Banquet." Although Zhang Longwen was from Changzhou, Wuxi was also within the jurisdiction of Changzhou. The Wujin Yanghu Joint Chronicle, Volume 28, says: "Zhang Longwen, courtesy name Changlin, a native of Wujin, a student of the prefectural school, was outstanding and had a strange air. He lived in seclusion next to the tomb of Jizi. When the large army went to attack Jiangyin, it passed through its territory. Longwen advocated that the villagers resist it, but the crowd collapsed, and Longwen was chopped to death, with wounds all over his body, but he still stood upright by the wall. (Chen Zhizhong: Righteous Shrine Record)</p>
<p>Volumes seventeen to twenty are Zheng Wuyu's four kinds of miscellaneous dramas: "Parrot Island," "Miluo River," "Yellow Crane Tower," and "Tengwang Pavilion." The first page of each drama is signed "Xishen Zheng Yu," which should be Zheng Yu, courtesy name Xishen. But Wang Guowei's "Opera Record" says that he was from Xishen, and he took Zheng Yu's courtesy name as his place of origin. According to, Xishen Mountain is Yushan Mountain, in Wuxi. Therefore, some people say that Zheng Yu is from Wuxi, which seems unreliable.</p>
<p>Because the compiler of the Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas, Zou Jin, was from Wuxi, the musicians he collected in the collection, such as Zou Dui Jin, Sun Yuanwen, Huang Jiashu, Du Tingyi, Xue Dan, and himself, were all from Wuxi. Zhang Longwen was from Changzhou near Wuxi.</p>
<p>Among the other musicians recorded in this book, those whose place of origin can be verified are Wu Weiye of Taicang, the author of volumes 12 "Tongtian Terrace" and "Linchun Pavilion," You Tong of Changzhou, the author of volumes 34 "Reading Lisao" and "Pipa," Mao Wei of Gui'an, Zhejiang, the author of volumes 6 to 11 "Su Yuanweng," "Qin Tingzhu," "Golden Gate Xiao," "Drunk Xin Feng," "Noisy Door God," and "Double Harmony," Meng Chengshun of Kuaiji, the author of volume 21 "Yan'er Mei," Cha Jizu of Haining, the author of volume 24 "Continuing the Western Chamber," and Lu Shilian of Changzhou, the author of volume 31 "Xitai Ji." Taicang and Changzhou are all places near Wuxi.</p>
<p>Those whose place of origin cannot be verified, and some whose names are not even known, are Nanshan Yishi, the author of volumes 12 to 16 "Half-Armed Cold," "Elder Sister Chang," "Zhonglang Girl," "Jingzhao Brow," and "Emerald Hairpin Fate," Zheng Yu, the author of volumes 17 to 20, Zhou Rubi, the author of volume 23 "Lonely Swan Shadow" and "Dream Fate," Bicao Zhuren, the author of volume 25 "Unfinished Fate," Zhang Laizong, the author of volume 26 "Cherry Banquet," and Tushi Daomin, the author of volume 33 "Straightforward Poem Xiao." I guess there are still a few people from Wuxi among them, but unfortunately I can't ask Zou Jin to find out.</p>
<h3>Tomb</h3>
<p>— By Masaoka Shiki, Abridged and Translated by Chen Jiayu</p>
<p>To live like this truly has no meaning at all. So, if I could die and be resurrected, take a trip to hell for about a year, and then quietly come back to life during my first death anniversary, giving a public lecture about the inside story of hell, how delightful that would be. But if going to the Western Paradise simply meant the end, then I couldn't be too grateful for that. Though, saying I'm not grateful is nonsense because all things are impermanent, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. If tonight the Ox-Head and Horse-Face arrive with the "fiery chariot" (Japanese folklore, the dead are taken away in this kind of chariot) to escort you, you have no choice but to die.  It would be great if I could make a deal, asking for a one-day extension, since my friends are planning to treat me to a night of revelry at "Willow Bridge" (a gathering place for courtesans). But since they're ghosts, they probably wouldn't agree. However, as the saying goes: "Money makes the ghost turn the millstone," so if I slipped a wad of banknotes into their pockets, perhaps the ghosts would yield to me. Unfortunately, I don't have even a single national currency on me. But even without money, one must pretend to have it, lest the ghosts see through you and think you are penniless.</p>
<p>Since death is inevitable, I must leave a will. To die without leaving any memento would be unspeakable.</p>
<p>Oh dear, there's so much noise and commotion in the next room. It sounds like they're debating whether or not to send a telegram saying "critical condition." What's that? It sounds like someone is saying in my ear: Isn't there anything left to say? Alas, how can there be nothing to say? Could you please find a way to borrow some money for me? Just that? No, I like steamed buns, I hope you add more steamed buns when making offerings during the memorial service, please, please.</p>
<p>Why is it so quiet? It's making me feel strangely sad. There's the smell of powdered incense (a Japanese funeral custom where the body is perfumed). I never liked this smell when I was alive, and I still don't like it much after death. There's so much weight pressing on my chest, making my body feel restricted. They must be packing my body with lime. When filling the coffin, they really should have been told in advance to use fresh flowers instead of lime. I forgot earlier, and now there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>Now we're heading to the cemetery. Judging from the sounds of footsteps and turning wheels, there are probably a hundred or so people attending the funeral. If it were reported in the newspaper, it would undoubtedly say three or four hundred. But, considering my humble self, a hundred or so people is not a small number.</p>
<p>Ah, this truly is the realm of complete death. Until the moment I was carried out in the coffin, I was still somewhat clear, and afterwards, the coffin...the sounds of bells, drums, and various melodies set me on fire, and I vaguely heard people saying things like "What a pity, Lay Buddhist Mu-lian has died." After that, I lost all consciousness. Now I hear a "clunk," and as I look, I am buried in an underground grave. It's truly silent and desolate, completely different from the feeling of seated meditation. Without a doubt, the air of hell is dead.</p>
<p>Ah, so many people have come! Who is it? Oh, it's still those same people from yesterday. Ah, so kind and thoughtful. You must be tired, not fearing fatigue, coming here to see if the burial has been properly completed. I am truly touched and grateful. You may not be able to see me, but I am under the mud and grass, grateful for your commercial friendship and deep kindness. As the saying goes: "The deceased are gradually forgotten," but on the contrary, you are endlessly and continuously honoring the dead. Based on my experience when I was alive, I would usually visit a friend's grave only once, and after that one visit, even though I always intended to go again, I never managed to do so. I pray in the afterlife that you all live long lives.</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. It has already been a year since my death. The memorial tower that my friends contributed money to build for me has been beautifully completed. A marble column stands on a square foundation, which is a bit too elegant. My friends truly went to great lengths for this, and their deep affection for the deceased is truly touching. A few days ago, I encountered two people in the cemetery. From their conversation, I gathered that the memorial tower has indeed been built, but there's no way to publish my manuscript. They want to ask friends for more donations, but since the tower has just been completed, it's not easy to say. Let's wait until next year's anniversary. This statement is unreliable, but on the other hand, even if the manuscript were published a year earlier, it wouldn't necessarily gain much greater fame. It will be good enough if it is published next year. Even if the ghosts laugh at me, I don't care myself. Anyway, since the person is already dead, the achievement can be judged. Really, people won't even come to tend the grave, and of course, there's even less effort to take care of things like manuscripts.</p>
<p>My neighbor in the afterlife, who I suppose is used to living in hell, still remembers the smell of earthworm urine very clearly. Here, I don't care too much about the desolation, but it's painful because my friends don't come, and I have no way of knowing what's happening in the world. What are my friends doing now? I don't know. If my concubine is still herself, then there is nothing I can do, and I must listen to it.</p>
<p>Alas, so lonely. In recent years, I have always been thinking: Maybe someone will come on the anniversary, maybe someone will come on the "Double Seventh Festival," but as a result, no one came. It's been roughly five years since I came here. I don't know what happened to my manuscript. It's probably not published or is making a living by trading. By now, it should have become a small, moderately sized old lady. Did she marry? I don't know. Are the warlords gone? I don't know. Most of the elders must have died, right? I died during the height of the military era. Who is in power now? I don't know.</p>
<p>Oh, it's so cool! There's a somewhat unpleasant wind blowing. It rained a few days ago, and some places have collapsed. The chirping of crickets sounds very close. Why doesn't anyone come to repair it?</p>
<p>Who is coming? At night, reciting poetry and pacing back and forth, it must be a scholar. Oh dear, he's stopped in front of my grave, using the moonlight to read the words on my tombstone. He's even kicking my memorial tower with his foot! This is so impolite. I should transform into a ghost and scare him. But people's hearts are not what they used to be. They are too greedy. If they knew there was a ghost here, they would definitely catch it and put it on display in Asakusa Park to collect admission fees and make money. So it's better to be quiet and not go out. This guy is reciting poetry and walking away.</p>
<p>Recently, those who have come to this place are all here for a purpose. Yesterday, strangely, a scholar wearing glasses came. He kept looking at my memorial tower. It turns out that a magazine has published an essay topic called "Tomb," and he came to gather material. In short, no one comes for nothing these days. Occasionally, there are those who come for no reason, and out of boredom, they randomly knock and destroy the memorial tower, leaving it in an irreparable state.</p>
<p>Ah, so cold, so cold! Now I don't even have skin that can get goosebumps from the cold. The hairs on my body have all fallen out, and I'm practically just bare bones. Alas, even the moonlight, which I thought was the coldest, shines sparsely on the dry bones.</p>
<h3>Victory Ring</h3>
<p>— By Feng Qinwei</p>
<p>The V-shaped victory ring that my father personally placed on the ring finger of my left hand is shining brightly. He specially had this ring made for me to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance. With tears filling my eyes, I gently caress it, as if caressing the thin and veined back of my father's hand. After only two days of painful struggle against the illness, my father was finally taken away from this polluted world by the god of death. Although my father has left us forever, his upright spirit and love will be immortal, shining like this victory ring.</p>
<p>It was in December of last year, not long after the end of the War of Resistance. The world celebrated peace, and every family looked forward to reuniting with their children. At that time, my father, who had suffered a stroke a few months earlier, was also eagerly waiting for his sons to return home, morning and night. When I, covered in dust, carried my travel bag and stepped into the home I had been away from for five years, I slowly walked towards my father's bed. I saw my father. He was sitting quietly on the bed smoking a cigarette. His face, aged and weakened by the burdens of life and the torment of illness, looked even more kind and pitiful. When he suddenly noticed my arrival, he laboriously used his left hand to support himself on the table and slowly stood up, calling out my name in unclear tones, repeating it over and over again. Tears of joy wet my eyes and my heart. I helped him sit down, and he turned around, using his trembling left hand to take out the victory ring that he had prepared long ago from the small leather box beside his pillow, and put it on my finger. He excitedly said to me, "I am so happy, the cruel war will not come again, I want to be with you forever, living a peaceful and happy life." But my father did not achieve his wish and left us so hastily.</p>
<p>What a beautiful and delicate ring this is. The V is placed above a plum blossom, and the ring is set with angel wings on both sides. It symbolizes victory and peace, symbolizing the most precious thing in the world—love.</p>

<h3>Double Perch, Double Flight (79)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(Fourteen)</p>
<p>Shi Yulou's suicide in protest of the world caused a stir in Beijing's Peking opera circles at the time, and his colleagues felt "the rabbit's death is the fox's sorrow" for a while. Mrs. Mo cried for a long time for the Weng Second Mistress's martyrdom, even making the usually playful and sensible Li Yun feel sad! Li Yun wasn't sad for anything else, but because over the years, the Weng Second Mistress had developed some feelings for her, unlike before, when their relationship was like strangers. However, after a few months, everyone's sorrow faded, and her colleagues and wives gradually forgot about these two unfortunate deceased people! Everyone still had to go their own way for their own lives, and no one could be tired of the world because of the deaths of Shi Yulou and the Weng Second Mistress!</p>
<p>Only Li Hua! She could never reduce her mourning for Shi Yulou's suicide! Moreover, she couldn't forget those unfortunate actors who sacrificed their youth; sacrificed their health; and even sacrificed their lives for "art"! She didn't sympathize and cry superficially like them; she mourned in her heart and remembered in her heart! She often repeatedly recited some of the loyal words that Shi Yulou had imparted to her: A male actor is society's plaything, and a female actor is even more so! A male actor's survival is inherently difficult, and a female actor's survival is even more difficult! Who can avoid illness? Who can avoid old age? When you are sick; when you are old; you have to fall down! Society will no longer look at you directly, and society will no longer hold you up, holding you up like a star, so red! So bright! Shi Yulou fell down, but he was once like a star in the sky! Li Hua, on the other hand, is currently a star in the sky! But one day, she will fade; lose her light; and no longer be so "red"; no longer be so "bright"! So she, too, will fall down like Shi Yulou! Falling into the mud, turning into a stinking, moldy corpse! Every time she thought of this, Li Hua was startled and shivered! She seemed to have already seen, not far ahead, a picture depicting her own fate.</p>
