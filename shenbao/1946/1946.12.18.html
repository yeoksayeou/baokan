<h3 id="c1">憲草審查告一段落　國大今晨重開大會　聽取綜合審委兩會報告 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕蔣主席以憲草審查已告一階段，十八日即將舉行大會，制憲工作最近即可完成，十七日下午八時再度邀集孫科，王世杰，張厲生，吳鐵城，陳立夫，張羣，洪蘭友，雷震等晩餐，並即席垂詢今日憲草審查經過，至爲詳盡，至午夜始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國大主席團十次會議，十七日下午四時舉行，何成濬主席，首由洪蘭友，胡適等報告綜合會議討論經過情形，至六時綜合散會，復由陳誠報告第四次綜合會經過，最後決定大會定十八日上午九時舉行，推何成濬任主席，由各審委會報告審查結果。下午三時舉行第五次綜合，繼續討論：一司法院院長，大法官，監察院，同意權問題（二）考試院組織及監察院同意權問題（三）公職人員考銓問題（四）監察院同意概及懲戒權問題（五）監察委員名額問題（六）監察院對於院長副院長之彈劾問題（七）省縣制度改爲地方制度問題（八）增列蒙藏地方自治制度條款問題（九）增列關於省區劃分之倏款問題（十）選舉章（十）（一）基本國策分別章節問題（十）（二）基本國策增加婚姻一條問題（十）（三）規定學生須超出黨派問題（十）（四）法律之定義問題（十）（五）憲法之解釋問題（十）（六）憲法施行程序之訂定問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕在京滿族人士溥儒等，十七日下午三時招待記者，呼籲對滿族予以注意與同情，溥首報告稱，民國成立三十五年來，散居各地之滿族，一向蒙羞被辱，深感歧視壓迫，祖傳語文，漸趨泯減，姓氏族籍，亦多隱沒，其不平等之情狀，已成變態。至仍成部落，以其固有生活習俗，繁衍於東北及新疆者，更不能分享國民權利，形同放逐。渠認爲旣云五族共和，實不能有所歧視，滿族問題已被忽略三十五年。國大制定中之憲法內，不應再予忽略，如蒙藏乃至少數土著民族之地位，可於憲法中列舉，三千餘萬之滿族，亦當獲得同等之扶助，渠以不能出席綜合審委會，祇得於此聲明，並以書面表達意見。至再開大會時，仍將提出，以冀此切膚修關之民族問題，得一合理之解決，否則此問題實如待發之薪，於國家並無益處也。繼由畢天民，新疆錫伯部落滿胞佟敏長，京市上滿胞蒼雨農，及富子　等，先後發言，咸謂清室乃係遜位，非被征服，民國以來，雖含垢忍辱，仍安分團結，爲國效忠。三十五年來，旣無叛亂情事，溥義之偽滿，亦未獲得滿胞之支持，乃竟不能享受應得之平等權。就國大言，業產及土著民族均有代表，獨滿族無之民，　制之進行中，亦少有人對滿族同情，渠等一致簽請各界支持渠等單純之要求：「爭取平等。」</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕綜合審查會之整理小組，十七日上午十時在國大主席團舉行首次會，出席綜合會召集人，各審查會首席召集人邵力子，林彬，孔庚，陳啓天，白崇禧，蔣勻田，王寵惠，徐漢篆等廿餘人，孫科主席，討論綜合會交付各案，歷時甚久，所決定　各項意見，即提下午舉行之綜合會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕綜合審委會第四次會，十七日下午三時五十分在國大第一休息室舉行，新聞記者准許入塲旁聽。開會時出席代表一三三人，旋續有到達，計一五一人，由陳誠主席，宣布開會後，即依據議事日程，進行討論，第一爲國大組織問題，因其中有關少數民族問題，未能解決，送整理小組討論，現經該小組將第廿六倏修正如次：國大由左列代表組織之，（一）每縣市及其同等區域，各選出代表一人，但其人口達五十萬者，每增加：五十萬人增選代表一人，縣市同寺區域以法律定之。（二）蒙古選出代表，每盟四人，每特別旗各一人。（三）西藏選出代表，其名額以法律定之。（四）各民族在邊疆地區選出代表，其名額以法律定之。（五）僑居國外之團民選出代表，其名額以法律定之。（六）職業團體選出代表，其名額以法律定之。（七）婦女團體選出代表，其名額以法律定之。提出後，僅劉踪萍提第三款內每特別旗各一人之「各」字應删去，作文字上之修改外，餘均無異議通過。第二爲國大代表不得兼任官吏問題，第廿八條整理意見爲「國大代表每六年改選一次，每屆國大代表之任期，至决屆國大開會之日爲止」，將第一審查組修改增添之「國民大會代表不得兼任官吏」十二宇删去，即照整理小組意見通過。第三爲立院職權問題，第六十二條整理小組修改爲「立院爲國家最高立法機關，由人民選舉之立委組織之，代表人民行使立法權」有人提出一代表人民」不必要，因立院係治權機關，非政權機關，不能代表人民行使治權。李中襄。尹述賢，陳啓天等均主張維持原案，付表決時，一〇八人多數通過，贊成除去「代表人民」四字者僅三十三人。繼討論第六十三條，整理意見僅將原草案內「大赦案」三字删除，衆無異議通過。第四爲立委名額問題，第六十五條整理小組修正如次：</p>
<p>立委總額不得超過五百人，</p>
<p>列委員組織之：（一）各省市選出者，其總額不得超過全院總額四分之三。（二）蒙古各盟及西藏選出者。（三）各民族在邊疆地區選出者。（四）僑居國外之國民選出者。（五）職業團體選出者。立委之選舉，立委名額之分配及婦女應佔之百分比，以法律定之。當有人提出硬性規定五百名不合理，新疆代表麥煥新等則提出，認爲各民族內對突厥之名稱及其區域應行規定，尙有若干意見，主席即時宣布交整理小組再行整理，然後交大會討論。第五爲總發布命令副署問題，整理小組擬維持原草案，按即第卅八條，原來在第三審查會時，曾爭辯甚久而未決者，經整理小組之審查，認爲仍照原案，第三組召集人史尙寬聲明，此案保留在大會討論。第六爲立法院複議時之人數問題，第五十八條整理小組修正意見爲：「行政院依左列規定，對立法院負責，（一）行政院有向立法院提出施政方針及施政報告之責，立法委員有向行政院長及行政院各部會首長質詢之權。（二）（三）維持原草案，此條討論甚久，對複議時人數問題形成數種意見，一爲立委三分二之出席，出席三分二之通過，一爲立委四分三之出席，出席三分二之通過，一爲立委三分二之出席，出席四分三之通過，其初贊成一項意見者居多，民社，靑年兩黨代表均有發言，旋至爭執不決時，潘公展起立稱：三分二之出席，出席三分二之通過，即等於全體委員之九分四，不足半數，自不能成立，此語甫出，衆皆鼓掌，表示贊成。旋經表決，以第二多數贊同通過，即立委四分三之出席，出席三分二之通過。其次清公展曾稱：立委之執行權，應爲立院之執行權，因立委必須在立院內始有執行權。主席宣布以此原則交整理小組，再加討論。第七爲司法院職權問題，第八十二倏整理小組意見修正爲：「司法院爲國家最高司法機關，掌理民事，刑事，行政訴訟之審判及公務員之懲戒」，此條爭執甚多，對懲戒權的隸屬問題，以及懲戒權之獨立討論至爲激烈，余家菊等均生維特原案，結果以七十七票多數贊同整理小組意見，通過。主席宣布，討論未畢問題，定十八日第五次會再行討論。</p>
<h3 id="c3">國大女代表爭選舉名額 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國大婦女代表，對於婦女在各項選舉中，應佔百分之廿之規定，曾經審查會通過，但又經整理小組否決。今日婦女代表均極表憤慨，全體簽名提具意見，交綜合委會請予注意，大有非做到不可之勢。</p>
<h3 id="c4">國民大會開會期內　馬特使不致離華　傳下令放棄派員赴延安 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十七日電〕據報載，馬歇爾特使左右表示，馬使至少在國大開會期內不致離華。馬使對國大討論憲草大感興趣，上星期日晉謁蔣主席，曾就憲草問題舉行長談。又司徒雷登大使已再度探詢中共對於將來恢復和談之態度，中共發言人王炳南告以中共態度早已表明。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十七日電〕可靠方面令夜謂，政府由於局勢變更，暫時已放棄派和平使者赴延安之實。非證實之消息謂，蔣主席已於兩日前將此項決議告知馬歇爾及司徒雷登。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕十六日晚勵志社有一部份國大代表舉行交際性質之宴會，與會者多爲學術，敎育，文化界人士，此爲社會賢達及政治學家之首次集會，井於會中公開發表關於制憲問題之意見。胡適，朱家驊，周鯁生，傅斯年四氏，被邀發言。</p>
<p>胡適首謂余對此次中國實騐民主政治，認爲一大成功，有人謂國民大會有疲勞轟炸之苦，其實以人數如此之多，較之美法各國國會超出數倍，而秩序井不在各國國會之下，美國一九一七年以前，參議員之議事規則，有一條規定，不得終止討論，眞是疲勞轟炸。胡氏對國民黨表示敬意，渠謂以一當政廿年之政黨，而自由精神與紀律效用同時充分表現，殊爲可貴。尤以最近兩日來之變化，國民黨所表現能發能收之精神，較之紀律更足稱頌。</p>
<p>朱家驊氏謂制憲固爲百年大計，但必須顧到當時政治環境，政協憲草乃經各方長時間之研討，綜合各方意見所制定之原則，自有時代上之價値，願各方促成，使大會順利完成此歷史性之任務。關於增强人民基本權力之精神，允宜尊重云。</p>
<p>周鯁生氏主張基本國策內，照原草案列入遵守聯合國憲草一條。氏謂，中國乃聯合國憲章四大重要簽字國之一，中國應有決心鞏固聯合國組織，實現聯合國憲章，以示中國必盡世界和平之任後。</p>
<p>最後傳斯年，羅家倫二氏，各就敎育與邊疆問題，發表意見。按今日適爲胡適生日之前夕，賓主表賀意。</p>

<h3 id="c40">聯合國大會的成就 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>聯合國大會已於十六日閉幕。在過去五十四日的會議中間，討論到許多重要的問題。雖然各國代表爭執甚烈，成功湖的波瀾迭起；但在大體上空氣尙爲融洽，會議的成就，也遠在第二次大戰後任何國際會議之上，英外相貝文說：「和平旭日正在升起」。大會主席斯巴克致閉會詞稱：「諸君返國時，得向貴國政府與人民傳達充滿信心與希望的消息。」我國首席代表顧維鈞亦稱：「所有决議，均甚重要，且極前進而包含自由精神，必能促進前所未有的合作，爲人類未來幸福，大放光明。」</p>
<p>欲求世界和平，必先防止各國最足威脅和平的軍備競賽。此次聯合國大會最大的成就，無疑是世界普遍裁軍決議案的通過。此次議案首由蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在十月廿九日正式提出，美國立即表示同意，並且更進一步主張設立管制機構，最後通過原則，交安全理事會討論辦法。在原則上裁軍包括任何國家任何武器，管制機構完全獨立，不受否決權的限制。這就是說：蘇聯不堅持保留否决權，願意報告並裁减國內外軍隊，美國可以交出原子彈秘密，由國際共管。這是美蘇兩國互相讓步最大的表示。假如安全理事會能够想出適當辦法，此項原則得以實施，第三次世界大戰的危機，似乎可以根本消滅了。</p>
<p>聯合國大會第二個最大的成就，就是對於西班牙問題，有了一個解決的方案。在過去，西研牙弗朗哥政權，遭受世界上許多國家的反對，蘇聯抨擊尤爲激烈，但是英國却亟力支持。主要的原因：（一）英國和西班牙的商業關係，佔英國出口很大的數目。（二）蘇聯勢力西漸，英國欲藉弗朗哥政權，加强防蘇的力量。（三）國際干涉，可能重新引起西班牙內戰，使歐洲局面再趨紊亂。由於上述的原因，任何制裁西班牙政府的舉動，英國都表示反對，美國因爲與蘇聯對峙的關係，對西班牙政府也不肯採取積極的行動。但是在這一次聯合國大會，英美都表示讓步，通過召回西班牙使節的決議案。雖然經濟絕交，軍事制裁的辦法，未得通過，但是召回使節至少是一個正義的表現。而且軍事制裁，必然激起大部分西班牙人民的反感，經濟絕交也要斷絕西班牙人民的生路，在目前恐怕也未必是最妥當的辦法。</p>
<p>此外尙有兩個重要問題，未得圓滿的解決。第一是限制五强否決權，第二是前敵國殖民地的託管方案。五强否決權，載在聯合國憲章，蘇聯認爲是聯合國機構成立的基礎，反對任何取消或限制的提議。許多小國家主張取消，美英同意限制，均未獲得具體的協議。但是聯合國憲章，隨意修改也容易動搖憲章本身的尊嚴，增加蘇聯的恐懼，而且事實上裁軍决議案可以不受否決權的限制，已經表示蘇聯對這個問題的讓步。</p>
<p>殖民地託管問題，許多國家都全張由聯合國讬管委員會直接處理，但是美英均不肯完全接受。不過關於太平洋各島嶼，美國總統杜魯門並未採納海陸軍部兼併的要求，只希望聯合國託管委員會交美國單獨託管，對聯合國機構仍然相當尊重。至於南非總理末資要求聯合國大會準許兼併西南非的提議，已遭大會大多數的否决。</p>
<p>總括來說，這次聯合國大會的成就已經相當可觀。同時聯合國大會和諧的空氣？更具體表現於四外長會議。五戰敗國和的中最複雜的問題，如像特港的共管，多瑙河的開放，戰敗國的賠償，都已獲得協議，對德和的已經開始討論了，下届莫斯科外長會議不難全部解决。據最近各國新聞的報道，一致贊揚蘇聯政第的轉變，是聯合國大會成功的主因。尤其令人滿意的，就是中國代表團此次在聯合國大會中採取的態度，不偏不倚，顧全各方面子，努力尋求妥協，以謀解決實際問題，博得各國的好評，使中國國際地位，無形中得以提高，聯合國大會此次的成就，中國代表團也有相當的貢獻。</p>

<p>向銀行取款者注意</p>
<p>我是靑浦金澤鎭上米行裏的管賬員，雖然是小資本的米行，但是每天進出的鈔票很多允其在早晨鄉農糶米的時候。我們經營的目的是把米專運上海出售的，故所有鈔票全是上海帶下來。或是向銀行錢店支取的。前日本行職員向上海糧號領取法幣二百萬元，每封五十萬元共有四封，因鈔票對得非常堅固，並且在麻綫上黏有銀行封條，憑那銀行的信用又因時間侷促，所以沒有點過，就即離滬返鄉，把那鈔票交給了我，我因爲見某報登過某鐵工廠整封鈔票常常短少的呼聲。所以我特別注意，所以逐一點過，不料果然有同樣的事發生，每封短少一萬元（以五百元十張作一萬元）共計短少四萬元。像我們的小生意簡實和走單帮差不多，很辛苦的把米運到上海，實指望賺幾個血汗的金錢，誰知歸家大失所望。這呌做小生意的太可憐了；銀行是社會金融的樞紐，尙且有此種流弊，這呌做小商意的怎樣呢？（靑浦金澤鎭趙新永）</p>

<p>「會」的來由，是稍有一點面子的有點勢力的人，因襲敵偽時期的惡習，用一種潛勢力來邀集，我們這些膽小怕事的人，不得逃避，這無本得利的事情，引起了多數人的效允，而我們是接會帖也來不及，十萬的，三十萬的，五十萬的，以至到一百萬的，層出不窮，如二十人組成的會，每人五十萬，則會首可得一千萬元，每月開標一次或二次，未得標者，按月的將款付淸，可是我們的「會」不只一個，至有四五十個，我們每月營業的收入，不過三四百萬，還要資本要開銷，而每月付會款，要超過兩三倍，這筆無着落的款子從何處而來？銀行去借嗎，我們小商人不做透支，請求政府救濟嗎？談何容易，我們還是去偷嗎，去搶嗎，不能永遠不能；這個難題怎樣解決呢？祇有呼籲政府當局及社會賢達想法將我們的生計維持解決，免淪乞丐，免爲惡勢力包圍而亡。（商民陳立榮　朱南雲　王子成　彭少安等）</p>
<p>青滬公路亟要改善</p>
<p>靑滬公路距上海僅廿五公里，（自上海界吳家港算起）而車資要四千二首元之多，實在太貴了！而且該路路面不平，此廿五公里中，有廿餘座橋，有欄的橋僅一二座，其餘都是沒有欄的木質橋，僅容、一輛汽車通過，兩輪已緊扣橋邊，使乘客驚心膽戰，該公司從未修理。所有橋多數只能載重三公噸而普通車都是五公噸，無怪要跌到河中去了！</p>
<p>現在盼該公司速將沿途橋樑修成永久式至少須載重八噸，不然十輪卡車無法通過，並將車資減低。（金自强）</p>

<p>— 卡爾教授著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>當前英國外交政策的骨幹，應該是旣不背離美國，也不開罪蘇聯，而要在兩者之間尋求平衡。</p>
<p>今日我們如果在談論外交政策的時候論及歐洲大陸和其他海外的世界，第一步便會連想到蘇聯和美國。蘇聯曾經由於德國的入侵遭受到驚人的劫掠和損失，在她把自己裝備得能夠成爲世界政治舞臺上活躍傑出的一員以前，橫在面前的是一段精神上和物質上廣大的復員計劃。美國雖然具備一切物質力量的因素，但是她的人民肩負一個前進政策，特別是肩負前進的歐洲政策的慾望到底有多强，尙在未定之間。蘇聯和美國將來在態度上的相異點是前者或將由於國內復興工作的進步力量因而增進於使她對於歐洲的行動更有見效。後者對干涉歐洲事件太灤的厭亞則將相應地增加。因此以後我們或許可以看見在歐陸上蘇聯所具的影響將較今日爲大，而美國所具的影響則較今日爲小。假使事實果然如此，英國外交政策的主要工作即在以蘇聯作爲主要力量的歐洲和以美國作爲主要力量的海外世界之間尋求平衡，至爲明顯。</p>
<p>英美兩國不能敵對</p>
<p>我對於英國不能參加的世界，特別是美國和其自治領，處於敵對地位的任何歐陸國家同盟這一層，大概不需要詳加辯述。自從第一次世界大戰以後，英國絕對不能參加任何美國不參加或者至少是雖守中立但實際上並無贊同傾向的軍事干涉，已經成爲顚撲不破的眞理。美國事實上不能够對於歐洲的統一全不顧問。但是歐洲團結這件事如果獲得任何有效成就，根據定義就必需排除美國，或者我們也可以說是對美國以利刃相向。英國永遠不能參加這樣的結合。絕對不參與單獨歐洲性的聯盟可能成爲英國外交政策基的礎。</p>
<p>但是英國同樣也不能把和歐洲以外的世界結合，而對歐洲本身利刃相向作爲外交政策的基礎，亦屬眞理。關於這一點，我想略加詳述。因爲人們有一種自然的趨勢相信言是一根確具實效的帶子，英語世界團結一致的傳統和感情，本身即能成爲鍜接並穩定一個政治集團的基礎。美國過去會經第一個警告我們這種思想是一個危險的幻覺，美國在政治傳統上包含頗爲强烈的反英傾向。即使在今天，國際上任何英美過分親密的合作均將在美國方面引起他們被請作「下井救人」的特殊懹疑。華萊斯在迫使自己辭職的演說中，曾經說過與此類似的話，但是他取咎的並不是演說</p>
<p>三角聯盟應予維持</p>
<p>因此我學得正如在戰爭中與美蘇兩國俱結同盟爲贏得勝利的主要條件一樣，在和平時期對於安全的保障這個似乎也有同等的重要性。這樣的三角同盟在今日實與在過去同屬必需。並且這個同時也就是保障英國國內安全和國外權益的條件。如果英國不能和美國保持友誼並互相諒解，則在遠東和太平洋的利益必不能發展。我也同樣確認如果對蘇不採取親善諒解政策，英國在中東（自地中海東岸至印度邊境的國家大集合地）的利益終必不能保持或加以利用。</p>
<p>許多歐洲國家所建立的政府的確都不很健全，以我們的眼光看來它們全不是好政府，因而甚至對之發生許多不滿。但是我想英美的意見並沒有爲這些國家接受的可能，也並不能引起她們改組政府使合於西方自由民主形式的意念。我們必需記得自從第一次大戰以後，差不多每一個中歐和東歐的國家都已經完成了西方式的民主憲法，但是根據這些憲法所產生的政府大多非貪汚即無能，或者兩者都有。當這樣的政府傾覆的時候也不會引起誰的哀悼。我們須知西半球的自由民主雖然有許多爲我們讚賞的性質，但是它並不是一個可到處通用的標準形式，只是某些民族在其發展的某一階段中所產生的政府形式而已。好比植物在適宜的土地上會滋長蓬勃，一且換了不適宜的土地就要枯萎凋謝，這種民主實際上從未在歐洲門外的土地上生根。</p>

<p>過去的，讓它過去罷！苦戰八年之後，也許我們曾把今年期望得太高，因之就免不了有點幻滅一的悲哀。但是，困苦艱難正是最好磨錬——中華民國四千多年的歷史決非偶然，我們無所用其恐懼！</p>
<p>有錯誤，我們就該毅然校正。前面的漫漫長途儘管崎嶇，我們祇要有咬緊牙關　傷前進的勇氣，又何妨回頭看一看？何况「過去」也不一定全無可喜之處呢！　因此，我們發起了民國三十五年十大新聞的選舉，分成「中國的「和」上海的「兩個部份，民國三十五年國內和本埠的面目，從這些項目中可以表示出一個輪廓了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市長壽路奇異愛迪生燈泡公司，原爲美商經營，戰時爲日人佔用，勝利之初，先山丹麥代管，於三十四年九月三十日，解僱工人二百餘名，遣散費每人發電泡一百五十隻。至去年十二月一日，經濟部正式將該廠發還美籍原主，整理復業。但該廠自復工之日起，只僱用工人八十餘人，專製造電泡之燈心炭絲，玻璃外殼則經由該廠三職員經手，委託其他工廠製造供應。囚製造範圍不如戰前之廣大，雇用工人之數量亦減少。但去年九月解散之工人，認爲彼等當時所退出者，爲日人佔用之廠而非奇異公司，今美人接收原廠後，彼等有權要求復工。因一再要求不成，遂於昨日下午二時許截留運廠之玻璃外殼，並扭至警察局。現此事已由勞方提請社會局調處，惟因勞資雙方均有理因，公斷頗感困難。</p>

<p>（又訊）又關於目前本市煤球用煤之配給，中心問題有兩：（一）成本問題，大廠小廠之生產成本不一律，有人主張分爲兩級，以顧全小廠之利益。成本審查小組定明日再至社會局開會，廠家對此最爲重視，故處理時十分愼重。（二）配售問題，有人顧慮將來煤球由零售商售與市民時，可能弊病業生，例如品質變劣或發生不應有之缺貨等情，故建議將來零售應分區辦理，每區推定一負責人，主管機關將隨時嚴加監查，如有弊病，即予嚴辦。又審議委員會定明日午後三時再在社會局召開。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨據記者向市府機要方面獲悉：本市明年度之預算中，可增加的四百億元之攻入，此項收入之來源，爲國民義務勞動之代金。</p>
<p>根據中央內政部之法令，凡自十八歲至四十五歲之壯丁，每年須爲國家義務服役三天。（本市則增爲十天）如不願作工者，得以現金折代。本中人口四百餘萬人，其中應義務服役之壯丁以全人口五分之一計，的爲八十餘萬人。每日代金以五千元計算，則可得總數四百億元，即市府明年度可增加四百億元之收入。</p>
<p>市府因明年度之收支差額過鉅，故預算表迄今未能編製完成，所屬各局處之預算，於上週市政會議撤回重編後，已儘量緊縮。據關係方面估計：本市明年之總預算約在二千五百億左右。據財政局之統計，本市明年度之總收入的爲二千三百餘億元，再加以勞動代金四百億元，則可收入二千七百億之數，則市府明年度之收支可相平衡，衆信其預算表可望於本週之市政會議中作最後之決定。</p>
<p>又昨據財局負責人語記者稱：本市政建設捐明年度是否可照常征收，尙未成定案，蓋該項稅收之徵收，係第一次市參會所決定，其目的在於補救三十五年度下半年之收支不能相抵。當時曾議決三十六年度之收入，須另謀開源。然財政局因鑒於本市明年度之財政仍極爲拮据，故已向參議會提出，請予繼續徵收一年云。財局所估計之本市明年度總收入二千三百餘億元巾，已包括市政建設捐二百餘億在內。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕在抗戰八年中，尤其是接近勝利的最後三年中，直接擔負招待人境盟軍任務的，是成立迄今已有十八年歷史的勵志社。</p>
<p>勵志社的成立，遠在北伐成功後兩年，它的性質和任務，單純的在於爲軍隊官兵服務，增進軍人的福利。類似的組織，在日本稱之爲偕行社。在英美稱爲陸軍靑年會。勵志社的工作對象是軍隊的官兵，猶如新生活運動的服務對象是一般國民一樣。它的工作有若干點和軍隊政治部（按現已改爲新聞局）有相似的地方；但它的存在和軍隊政治部是不重複的。軍隊政治部的工作對象，限於本部隊的官兵，而勵志社的社員是經過一定手續入社的一般官兵。甲軍的某連長或者乙師的某下等兵都同樣可以請求入社，入社後便同樣有一定的　利和　務。</p>
<p>勵志社的工作，在　　前已經有了很好的成績。南京總社的建築物，以及內部精美的設計和科學的管理，常爲人所稱道。抗戰爆發後，盟軍入境者日多，這艱鉅的招待盟軍的任務，就落在勵志社的身。</p>
<p>談起勵志社，就使人很自然的聯想到新生活運動總會。因爲　兩個團體的實際負責人，都是被描寫爲高大結實的黃仁霖總幹事。以他的才　和各方面的關係，來主持招待盟軍的工作自然是最合適不過的。</p>
<p>招待盟軍眞不是簡單的事。所謂「招待」就存在着客與主人的關係。主人請客能够使客人稱心滿意，已經大感不易，而抗戰期間，物力維艱，更增加困難。入境盟軍的生活享受，原來很高，且大多先存了一種優越感，負責招待的主人，不僅要儘量供給客人以日常生活必需品，還要注意到他們身心的健康與需要，因爲兩軍並肩作戰，直接關係着戰爭的勝負，間接關係着兩國未來的交誼。</p>
<p>從招待盟軍一點看，我們可以知道勵志社的努力是多方面的。人境盟軍的眞實數字，我們無從取得統計。但就招待的意義說，勵志社對於每一個入境的盟軍官兵，都有被招待的義務。民國卅年以後，盟軍集中最多的昆明，决多的成都，每天需要七八百頭牛，四五百條猪，和上萬個的鷄蛋。影響所及，鄰近省縣的肉價，都扶搖直上。在盟軍所在地，勵志社要爲他們佈置舒適週到的招待所，甚至連茶房僕役都要加以歐式的訓練。在精神方面，經常爲他們舉行音樂演奏會，球類比賽，創辦營地刋物，舉行跳舞會等等。凡是能想到也可能做到的，勵志社的設計人，無不花盡了腦筋，爲盟軍「張羅」。</p>
<p>爲了招待盟軍，勵志社特別設置了戰地服務團，分佈在各盟軍駐在地，遠至於印緬，都有服務團團員的足跡。並和已經撤消了的軍委會外事局合辦譯員訓練班，爲中美合作寫下了不可磨滅的一頁</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以外商火油行，不滿輸管會按照戰前火油轍入額，以定現時之輸入額，致與目前激增之耗油量不符，使各油行不能儘量以所存火油應市，特趨訪輸管會執委會秘書處長陳長桐氏，據稱：該會對輸入品限額之規定，除參照民國廿四·廿五·廿六三年之輸入額外，尙須參照民國卅五年之輸入額。所以參照卅五年之輸入額者，蓋有鑒於勝利後，我國對某種輸入品之需要量，或已有所變更，俾可根據實際情形，而伸縮其輸入限額。如火油一項，勝利後輸入額激增，則在分配限額時，當須根據實際情形之變更，而增加其輸入限額，決無完全根據戰前輸入額之理·故火油進口商目前之疑慮、當屬不必要。現時該項限額雖尙未確定，惟火油之輸入，依舊源源不絕，初未因修正進出口貿易辦法之頒行，而有所變更也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本月十四日下午，自京飛滬途中，在浙江長興縣境失事墮毀之中央航空公司第卅一號平滬班機，機中所載鈔票爲國幣十二億元，事先中國銀行曾向中國產物保險公司保有安全保險，其保額爲國幣六億兀。現悉：其中十七包（如以三十一包共十二億元計，十七包的爲六億六千萬餘元）並未焚燬，已由長興縣政府尋獲後，妥爲保管中。</p>
<p>按中央公司自接到長興縣政府之電報後，除於當晚派員會同中國銀行及中國保險公司人員漏夜乘火車取道嘉興前往調查外，昨晨得悉長興境內有一小機塲可供飛機降落，乃於中午復派飛機一架，由機航組主任陳文寬親自駕駛，該公司秘書鄔烈旗，中國銀行襄理周克昌等同行，並載帶吉普卡一輛，於中午十一時自滬起飛至長興，在離出事地點龍王廟的十公里之小機坪巾降落，然後乘吉普卡駛往查勘。當晚即留宿該處，今日並將繼續調查。陳文寬主任等於三時許原駕機返滬。</p>
<p>據陳氏昨晚告記者稱，彼本人因須照顧飛機，故降陸後並未同車前往，僅於空中盤旋時，目見失事客機之殘骸已移運至龍王廟，大郃份均已毁損。其後中國銀行人員曾吿彼鈔票十七包業已尋獲，至於該客機之失事原因，則目前尙不能確定。</p>

<p>又據鄔秘書烈旗返滬後向記者談失事情形稱：四十七號航機，於昨晨十一時起飛，十一時四十五分，抵達長興上空，俯瞰長興，崗巒起伏，山嶺錯綜，盤旋低飛二週，見三十一號機殘骸，橫臥弄山山畔，繼即至長興城內，降落後，即赴長興縣府訪晤程縣長，據程縣長稱：山路崎嶇，往返須四小時以上，　阻渠等入由，蓋恐時間匆促，當日不克趕返上海也。繼又詳吿三十一號機失事詳情稱：十四日下午四時許，長興民衆見有飛機一架，自西疾飛而來，旋聞轟然一聲，料爲失事，渠乃急飭人馳往弄山頂之能王廟查勘，據該地鄉鎭長稱：當時龍王廟山下鄉民，見有紙片甚多，自山頂紛紛　下，知爲機巾之物，乃羣趨觀　，則赫然竟爲花花綠綠之鈔票也，一時歡呼搶取，哄動遠近居民，爭先恐後，滿載而歸，蓋當鈔票飄落後，曾堆積滿地，俯拾即是，易如探囊取物，迨縣府人員抵達，乃會同鄉鎭保長，禁止鄉民搶拾，並一面飭人從速拾取，以蔴袋裝盛，計得二十蔴袋，一面派人守候罹難屍體五具，三十一號機機身並未起火，僅撞至粉碎，罹難人員，全係撞跌斃命，裝鈔票之木箱，已無法覓得，至此二十蔴袋鈔票，現已運至縣府保存，由長興縣政府，長興法院檢察處，及當地鄉鎭長簽字查封，法院方面，亦派員至出事地點，騐明屍身，呈報上峯備案，現屍身業已運至長興縣府內。</p>
<p>當陳主任文寬鄔秘書烈旗，周襄理克昌等抵長興縣府時，中國銀行湖州分行陳經理，亦已由湖州趕抵長興，會同周氐與長興縣府洽談鈔票敬落及鄉民搶拾之經過，並於昨晚電吿上海方面，現周襄埋與陳經理仍留長興，靜待上峯指示，再行決定如何處理方針，中央航空公司人員，除四人留守屍身外，陳主任與鄔秘書，昨乘原機於下午四時三刻起飛回滬，五時三十分左右抵達此間，定明日（十九日）再派機赴長興裝運屍身來滬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨八時許，南市四牌樓陸家宅弄四十七號衡業公司前，有一水果行經理倪祥水（綽號「炸彈」，年廿七歲，寗波人），突被潛伏該處之暴徒廿餘人，以利斧小刀等向其猛砍，當塲身中十四刀，鮮血直流，痛極倒地。暴徒等見目的已達，即一閧而散，事後倪負創掙扎爬至弄口，始僱人力車投該管邑廟警察分局報吿，由該局派警先將其車送仁濟醫院醫治外，並派巡官范伯熊率長警楊淸源·陳萬福·羅志遠·朱道顯前往出事地點調查，當檢獲小刀四把，兇手迄晚尙在嚴密偵緝中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：宋院長此次在滬召集紡織界有關人氏談話時，曾表示政府將統收全國棉紗，俾對我國棉紡事業，作統盤之改進計劃。此舉純本取之於棉紡事業還之於棉紡事業之原則。後與會人民咸表：國人留性崇尚自由，過份之限制，恐反不易澈底施行盡利，故原則上決定仍以外棉部份之產紗，交由政府收購。至國棉部份，可不致過份限制。此　政府供給鉅額瞞棉外匯，當須收回一部棉紗，　供平準國內紗價之用。同時爲彌補該項鉅額外晚之外溢計，政府將儘可能鼓勵一切足炎出口之物資出口，以資挹注。</p>
<p>至明年度外棉輸入之限額，除調查各紗廠，洋行，花號等存棉量，及迄明年底以前可能收購之國棉量外，再核計其尙短少之原棉量，即以此爲明年度之外棉輸入限額。據估計該項限額大致爲八十萬包。以每包美金一百七十五元計，合計共需價款美金一億四千萬元。</p>
<p>據紡管會消息：第六區棉紡公會所屬會員廠，已有九十二家將存棉量報到。據統計結果：各廠迄本年十一月底爲止之存棉世，總計爲二萬二千萬磅，平均足敷各廠一百五十日之用。據該會業務處長劉文騰語記者：所有全國各區紗廠，務須將存棉量尅日報到，否則即表示該廠並不需要外棉，將來將喪失領配外棉之權云。</p>
<p>又據悉：原棉限額分配審核會，將由輸管會執委會限額分配處處長李幹，紡建公司副總經理吳味經，六區棉紡公會秘書長奚玉書合組之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於十一月十七日以前在外國訂貨之處理，當局已正式宣佈在十一月廿四日前啓運之貨物，可考慮其允許進口。據有關人員表示：此類訂貨之中種類繁多，大概棉花可得進口之許可，白報紙亦有進口之布望，五金貨物即頗成問題。又廿四日後運出之貨物，物主以如依規定原船退回，旣喪失商業信用，運費支出損失更大，故已在多方努力，希望政府能從寬處理。又經營進出口業人士，對於以剩餘物資配售與進口商之可能性，均深表關切。渠等認爲此類物資數量固多，但是否能適應市塲需要，大可懷疑；即使有有價值之民用物品，恐早已落入有特殊背景商人之手，正當商入所得者，恐爲剩餘物資中之剩餘者。政府目前一面實行進口許可制，同時運來大批剩餘物資，力求國際收支平衡，用心良苦。惟在現制度之下，手續周折費時，商人不便殊多。例如顏料在世界市塲上，今日已成奇貨可居，定貨必需迅速，方可不失機會。但如今日外國來一徵求同意之電報，我國進口商辦申請手續，即需費時兩週，貨物早被他人訂購矣。近來進出口業正以集體的努力，求申請手續之簡化。又據該業人士觀察，待剩餘物資運來者漸多，進口限額完成決定時，以物資配售與進口商即將成爲事實</p>

<h3 id="c157">臺灣特殊化機構　專賣局·貿易局橫斷面 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 臺北四日航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>被稱爲經濟的「眞空地帶」的台灣，在光復一年餘的現在，仍保留了原先的特殊姿態。過去的現象是：台灣銀行拒絕了中中交農的設立，帶了全國通行的法幣關金，一登基隆和和高雄的口岸，就成了廢紙似的，否則就給中間商人和銀行的匯劃吞蝕了三分之一或二的數目，商人在國內完納了國稅的統稅，可是客貨却最易遭致專賣局警察局的沒收，他們不是說這是執行公署的命令，就是說與本省專賣政策相抵觸，至於沒收以後的下落如何，是容易引起問題的。</p>
<p>這種和國內經濟絕緣以後所引起的阻塞狀態，充分說明了由於本省當局的特殊見地而演出的特殊作風，這個作風縱遭受到各方的批許攻擊，但直到如今除了專賣局已給修正以外，此外還沒有可以發見改革的端倪。長官是愛獲台灣的，他更堅持以發展國家資本的民生主義，移置於合島作爲實騐，但橫在現實的難題使他所要實踐的經濟理想，完全受了陣碮。</p>
<p>專賣局機構龐大</p>
<p>五種專賣品收入七億餘</p>
<p>作爲台省龐大的機構的專賣局，它擁有台北總局，局內分設了十一科室，省內十一個分局，兩個辦事處，兩個烟廠，兩個樟腦工廠，十三個酒廠，兩個火柴工廠，還有番子田工廠，度量衡所烟草試騐所，和接收了業務有關的啤酒，精製樟腦，樟腦油，印刷，酒瓶，葡萄糖公司等四十一個單位，這些單位，不但一般人不淸楚，就是該局本身也未能完全暸解。</p>
<p>任維鈞局長於去年十一月一日將該局全部接收，原先是三分之二停頓的工廠，十天以內大部復工；現在有六千五百多個職工，分佈在各個單位裏，爲專賣品的製造和銷售而工作着。</p>
<p>被接收的該局產業價值，按台幣購人價格計，有土地二〇，一九四，〇四一公畝，折合八，一入八，五五〇元，機器八，三〇八，〇九七元，建築物計四，八六九公畝，折合一六，九七二，七一九元，原料總值一六，二三九，七四一元，材料總值二，七八六，三七〇元，其他材料合計三，一九二，一一八元，製造用具總值一，五九八，四〇四元，運輸用具三四四，二二一元。成品及半製品在外。</p>
<p>日本人時代，以八種專賣品（鹽，樟腦，鴉片，烟，酒，汽油，度量衡，火柴）的最高收人額曾佔全省歲收百分之四十九以上，一九四〇年的收入且突破一億日圓。接收以後，鴉片明令撤廢了，汽油也無專賣必要，食鹽也於本年四月一日移交鹽務管理局，所以現在的專賣品，主要是樟腦，烟，酒，（包括米酒，啤酒）火柴，度量衡五種，據該局預計本年度收入台幣七億餘元，佔全省歲收百分之三十二以上。</p>
<p>利益較統稅爲低</p>
<p>舊政策已準備完全改變</p>
<p>任局長對記者說，民主國家有專貸制度是不合理的。中國戰時專賣制度的確立，他担任了重慶專賣設計委員，自廿九年至卅年間，曾在湖南担任了專賣局長，後來因爲稅收正常，原料缺乏，並以戰局緊張而取消，那時他正担任了財部專賣的考核委員。他說明目前所感到的困難是（一）工價高漲（二）原料缺乏（三）運輸困難，此外就是國內私貨源源而來影響了收入。可是按諸實際，這獨善政策所表現的成績呢？顯然的是因爲各廠出品只憑生產能力與原料情形而自由生產，售價高，品質壞，堆積如山的香烟，無法推銷，成本二十元台幣的啤酒零售七十元，超過了上海怡和啤酒的價格，美國人造樟腦更奪去世界產額百分之八十的合灣樟腦的市塲，而因爲龐大的機構管理不善，監督不週，成本會計固無法報造，而更易爲食汚份子聚腥逐臭之所。八月二日間嘉義分局長陳際堤因貧自殺，已被檢發爲吞沒專賣品六十萬元而畏罪自盡，繼任分局長周必璋和最近南門工廠長劉熾草均以食汚被扣，以及其他若干案件，都足爲說明人事監理制度的未能盡善。</p>
<p>繼承殖民地財政政策的產物底專賣制度，目前顯然是置重點於收入上的。任局長說，該局自上年十一月至本年六月底止，解庫數字爲二億零六百餘萬元，而庫存材料製成品及應收賬款總值尙有六億七千餘萬元，沒有虧損，還有盈餘。七月份起各地營業收人都較六月份增加一倍，七八月份都有盈利。而據嚴財政處的意見，認爲可以繳庫的數字較原定預算少了許多，專賣和統稅不同，前者利益高於統我，要是利益相同成反較低，則辦法根本須重新檢討。其實專賣局自七月份起指定各分局採取包辦制，除規定繳局數額外，在超過數字巾支付其行政經費，否則薪金亦可不開支，這種現代財政制度底流弊，已獲得了實例。</p>
<p>長官對專賣收入，他自己說也是很焦慮的，因爲中央和各省都沒有這種制度，所以發生了許多糾紛和非難。他更說明南巡沿途所見的烟，酒，大都不是專賣局的，過去日本佔領時本土也實施專賣，所以在台灣行得通。他乾脆地說：「原則上我是主張專賣的，萬一行不通，不妨簡單的改徵統稅，改良出品，或反可增加收入，這是政策問題，即擬改變辦法，也須有準備時間」。對於沒有前途的專賣的存廢，當局已顯露了考慮的端倪了。</p>
<p>貿易局否認統制</p>
<p>主要業務：進出口和配銷</p>
<p>台省另一個財政重點是安置在貿易局，這個局也是台灣特殊化下的產品。他們最先接收了日太加强統制台灣貿易的最高形態—「台灣重要物資營團」，二十萬日軍遣回以後，始將日本財閥的三井，三菱台灣支店及其附屬機構的財產，予以接收。原先用公司名稱，因爲法理上不能依照公司法，二月一日就改成了現在的局。</p>
<p>顧名思義，貿易局的業務以進出口配銷爲主，局長于百溪特別對記者說明，他們接收了日本人的統制機構，而沒有接收日本人的統制政策，唯一兼辦行政的統制品的就是禁止食糖私運出口。採取這樣的手段是因爲（一）台省戰時損失甚大，把握物資交換，堪以從事復興建設。（二）省外糖價較省內高約十倍，不能任憑少數冒險商人嬴得暴利；（三）本省碩果僅存的糖，設與省外交換奢侈品及不需要的貨物，勢必分散力量。到八月五日，這禁令也取消了。現在只有糧食，省內准許在八個區域內流通而仍禁止出口。他說，現在是百分之百的業務，而絕非統制。繼續他又聲明貿易局的地位是與商人對等的，集中人力物力，爲各單位購買出入物資，避免浪費，分別就緩急輕重，調劑盈虛，要是商人委託，也樂予接受。</p>
<p>半年來該局的業務中心是（一）出口物資有糖七·〇一七噸，煤二〇·九一六噸，樟腦三一六噸，茶葉四八五箱，木材四一七箱，橘子一·〇〇〇箱，這與戰前鼎盛時期每年出超台幣二億元，不可同日語。（二）進口物資主要的是布疋一〇〇·〇〇〇疋，麵粉九〇·九〇〇袋，肥料七·二五六噸，大豆餅三·〇二九噸，花生餅二·五三二噸，其他菜子餅等；（三）配銷麵粉九〇·九〇〇袋補救糧荒，布疋一〇〇·〇〇〇疋，特約省內承銷商五十二家分銷橡膠品以及電石等。省內基隆，高雄，台中設有辦事處，省外除上海外，準備在香港，靑島，天津，大邊，福州，東京等處成立辦事處，對省內配銷機構也準備最近完成。而這半年可能出口的物資的值台幣七萬萬元，進口物資肥料，布疋，器林等的二萬萬元，可獲純益二億七千餘萬元。</p>
<p>兩種人反對貿易局</p>
<p>襲斷商品奪取獨佔利益</p>
<p>于局長更說明，有兩種人是竭力反對貿易局的，一種是囿於傳統的政治關係，有意反對的，這可沒辦法解釋；一種是利害關係的商人，像以台省資本來運用的大公企業公司和國內閩，溫，滬各方的商人。光復後他們集中目標於肥料，於是以滬市四十萬一噸的化學肥料運來，結果以十八萬法幣的價格脫售，這種蝕本買賣因爲他們不理解本省的實情，因爲過去關於年需的五十萬噸的肥料，是採取嚴格管制和定量分配的辦法，而他們以低價拋售了肥料，企圖以食　來　補的意想，遭遇了頓挫，結果是惹起了這部份人的反對。他以下列的話作爲結語：「貿易局不是以利爲目的，而是以調劑民生從事建設的業務機構！截至六月份止繳庫係一億元。」</p>
<p>在他說明的另一面，人們卻認巳看到商人作風的近景，貿易局以高抬糖價達到獲利目的，這種苦肉計的成就有限，它　斷了商品貿易，於對內外交易上，奪取獨佔利益。在第一次省參議會席上，一個參議員說：現在官民離反的原因，多因貿易局而來，貿易法中央已命令廢除，用來本省實在不妥，非撤廢不可。顯然的，在商人不應獲利的獨佔下，這個包攬的特殊化的貿易制度，頗遭致了省內外人們的不滿，人們都在回憶着，戰時各省的貿易公司。封建割據的經濟樣式，加深了省與省問的壁壘，也造成經濟本身的萎縮，但陳儀長官他不願意讓少數商人獲致暴利，企圖運用貿易局統買統賣，給官方賺錢用之於民，他堅信這是總理遺敎所指示的經濟理論！（八月）</p>

<p>阿羅賓多，其受余之頂禮膜拜乎！</p>
<p>今日見汝之身，遍屬智慧；</p>
<p>他日見之，余則無曾頌讚矣！</p>
<p>阿羅賓多，其受余之頂禮膜拜乎！——太戈爾</p>
<p>印度洋之濱，法領邦迪迦里Pondicherry當代聖哲阿羅賓多氏Sri　Aurobindo居焉·阿氏居此已歷卅載有餘，且十五年來，默然無語，惟與聖母梅拉氏Melar，the　Mother論道，則屬例外。阿氏所爲者，欲使衆生轉爲神聖，同登覺岸，世界各國學者，不遠千里而來，以一見阿氏爲榮。每年參訪人士，數以千計，惟吾國人士能知阿氏者，不過數人而已，豈以須彌大山之阻隔使然？雖然，吾國人知甘地·太戈爾·眞納，尼赫魯者衆矣。惟對此三萬萬印人所崇拜之印度敎敎主，如阿羅寶多氏者，知者殊鮮，不免遺憾。筆者會遠赴邦迪迦里，訪謁阿氏，歸來滿懷情感，十一月廿四日係阿氏出世修真三十五年週年紀念日，用述其生平，介紹於國人之前，幷誌仰慕之忱。</p>
<p>七四老人道貌岸然</p>
<p>阿氏今年七十四歲，鶴髪童顔，道貌岸然，望之敬畏。渠生於一八七二年八月十五日，於加爾各簽鄉聞，其父克立須那達古須Krlshna　Nath　Ghose爲孟加拉省Bengal名教育家，惟望其子女受完全之英國式教育，故當阿氏五歲時，即這送大吉嶺Darjeeling聖保羅英文學校就學，七歲時，乃興其兄弟二人，同赴英倫，就學於某英人私塾中，十三歲時，乃考入倫敦聖保羅中學，五年後，進入劍橋大學之皇家學院，幷得希臘興拉丁文之學金，畢業後，無節度文官高等考Indian　Civil　Service　Examination所有筆試，俱列前茅，惟彼不願作行政事務，最後的騎射考試，朱曾參加，不能取得正式資格。阿氏果願作行政事務，則阿氏今日在社會上地位，非大法官亦省督之職矣。嗣阿氏遇印度彼羅多土邦Baroda　State王公於英倫，承囑於一八九三年返印，任職於該邦之國庫署，同時兼任邦立學院副院長，當其回印前，其父病逝，未能一見爲憾。</p>
<p>久留英土　精通外語</p>
<p>阿氏旅居英倫年，受歐西文明最深，爲希臘拉丁文學者，幷通法·德·義諸國文學，對於但丁神曲，歌德之浮士德，尤爲精通，梵文·巴利以及孟加拉文，更屬專精，曾將印古詩人迦梨陀沙Kalldas所著梵文之「勇健與方廣傳奇」Vikrama—Urvasi譯阿氏所著若干詩文、先後出版。同時，開始練習瑜珈，精進至速，詩文高超飄逸，其最近所出版之詩文　集，詩人　爲文學界中稀有之作品。其與美立　麗女士結婚時，亦在此時，但阿氏並不以娶得賢妻而享閨房之榮，渠常對其失人曰：吾人應以高超思想，平常生活爲立家要旨，迄一九〇六年，阿氏離波羅多土邦返加　各答，中經土王　切慰留而未　·斯時，阿氏乃開始實際政治活動‘初任孟加拉省立民族學院National　College院長，英人以其與祖國日報反英事有關，乃將其解職，嗣又復任，至被捕入獄前止。</p>
<p>一度組黨自任領袖</p>
<p>阿氏之任祖國日報主筆也，其立論興時人殊異，蓋印度當時大多數人士所主張者，爲殖民地之自治政府，阿氏却主絕對之完全自由獨立的國家。更以國家精神覺醒爲首要·阿氏會組織國家主義黨NatoinalistParty自任領袖，並於一九〇七年於修羅地Surat主持全國國家主義者大會，使印度政治，突然覺醒。其時，詩人太戈爾氏Tagor　遊歐，特赴邦迪迦里訪晤阿氏，並日：「吾輩正待汝之圓音普被，祖國在汝之聲聞中而蘇醒」。嗣阿氏胞弟波令多羅蠟組革命團體，英政府疑阿氏從巾策劃，捕之人獄，時在一九〇八年五月間，迄翌年五月出獄，在獄中一戴時光，專錄瑜珈，而獲證道。出獄之後，見黨中同志四散，並感政治運動之實質，不過爲一宗敎復興運動之顯現。遂於一九一〇年二月間，由加爾各答揚帆赴邦迪迦里繼續潛修，以實現其人類由凡轉聖之大志。其時，印度國民大會黨NationalCongress猶望阿氏出山，參加政治運動，並以主席一職與之，但經阿氏婉言拒絕。最後國大黨達斯先生ChitaranjaDas往訪阿氏，促渠出山，阿氏答曰；「吉檀足下，余不再以余之原來思想與靈感，參與人世間之事，余正在追尋最高之目的，若我此志能酬，則余以此爲基礎，作爲余新事業之開始。阿氏所言之目的，究何所指，以筆者管見所及，昔日阿氏所編雅利安月刋。足可說明其義。此月刋出版於一九一四年，正當阿氏四年面壁之後。</p>
<p>生平著作　百數十卷</p>
<p>阿氏生平著作達百數十卷，其最主要者則爲生命神聖哲學The　Life　Divine及梵經述評Essays　on　theGita二巨著都二百餘萬言，凡所立論，皆係闡發精神與智慧，以及瑜珈論證，其餘文章，則係包括印度古代文化與文明，吠陀眞義，人類種族進化，詩之創化與格調，以及世界大同之旨。雅利安月刋至一九二一年停刋，現在繼起出版者，則爲降生月刋，爲其弟子所編，以蘭揚阿氏哲理爲宗旨，由印度馬特拉斯阿羅頻多圖書館發行，另有阿羅頻多年報及季刋，則分由加爾各答與孟買兩地之阿氏哲學會出版，宗旨與降生同，阿氐卓錫邦迪迦里不久，聖母梅拉氏Mear　the　Mother由日本到印，謁訪阿氏，聖母法人，今年六十九歲，視之猶若三十許人，幼具修真願，及長，</p>
<p>阿羅賓多近影（本報駐印記者周祥光攝寄）專以訪道爲事，足跡遍歐亞兩洲，對於東西洋哲學，造詣至深，觀其所著各書，確已悟道，今日阿氏哲學院Sri　Aurobindo　Asram中，由她主持之。</p>
<p>生命神聖　哲學精深</p>
<p>阿氏哲學院，位於邦城之東，臨印度洋，院舍百餘幢，風景淸幽，花香鳥語，茂林修竹，確爲修眞勝地。在院修道士，的四百多人，皆爲印度當代之藝術家。音樂家。詩人·作家·工程師以及醫師等，彼輩以畢生生命，追隨阿氏修眞，以實現阿氏「生命神聖之月的」。</p>
<p>阿氏所提倡之「生命神聖」與古代印度瑜珈異，蓋人之從事於瑜珈也，一到成功，則其人之心靈與肉體，必分離而去，佛之所謂入湼槃，即此之謂，然阿氏生命神聖哲學，則分二途而歸宿之，一日上昇，一日下降。上昇者，則其人自開悟起至澈悟止，佛之所謂證菩提與夫大圓鏡智是也。下降者，則其證菩提後，下降其慧力，不但入於性靈，還須滲入於肉體中，使此肉體轉爲神聖。由此可知阿氏哲學在人之成道後，允須在人間世爲人類造福利，並非爲一己之利益也。博大精深，發前人之所未發，無怪法文豪羅曼羅蘭讚曰：「阿羅頻多氏集東西洋哲學於一身，融精液於一爐！」吾國古代仙家所持之參同悟眞眞理，與阿氏哲學頗有相似之處，可惜吾人語言文字二障未解，不能互相印證，佛言世界眞理祇一，則阿氏哲學自與吾國仙家哲理同，理之顯見，則待有心人爲之也。</p>
<p>中印兩國，唇齒相依，文化上交往，達二千年。在此畏期交往中，無征戰之事發生，爲史學家視爲美談。且吾國文化，備受佛陀思想之影響，若宋明新儒家之復活，即爲一例。今後吾人要促進中印學術文化與夫兩國民族情誼，對於印度立國精神，不可不加以研庫，阿羅賓多氏之哲學，可謂代表此一趨向。今後吾人要爲未來世界和平奠一基石，則對阿氏哲學，允須致力焉。十一月廿四日爲阿氏出家修眞三十六週年紀念，簽者因公務所牽，未克前往拜謁師尊，謹譯「梨俱吠陀」一頌，遙祝之曰：</p>

<h3 id="c159">黃河堵口　明年一月夜工能否完成　將受「時間」二次考驗 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭州九日航訊　本報駐鄭記者范世勤</p>
<p>時間是非常無情的如果請它作爲證人的話，它是毫不客氣的說出實話。黃河花園口堵口工程，廉江是本年七月一日以前完成，要它作個證人，它就說出一個「否」字完事了。現在它預備在明年二月一日第二次作證，這什得我們猜測，那時，它是否仍舊說出「吾」字，還是改說「是」字？</p>
<p>一件事情的失敗，總是有許多原因。花園口堵口第一次的失敗原因可多：一切事情總是與政治上結了緣，所以一談到花園口堵口這件事，就不免又要說到中共問題上去了。離花園口一百多里以下的黃河古道下游，差不多有近千里是在中共的手裏。堵口的目的，在引水到古道裏去，那末整理古道與花園口堵口是一件事。黃河水利委員會因此在三月間派了一個測量隊到下游去測量，同時估計估計古道復堤的土方工程，可是他們一到考城，就被共軍阻擋了。這樣一來，這方面花園口堵口工程的開展就受了延誤；四月間在新鄉附近的潞王項的堵復局的兩架開石機，又被共軍打得稀爛，當時還被捉去了幾個人，那也影響了一部份的工程；到了五月間拋石的時候，中共眼看這工程就要完成派了人到花園口來找麻煩，還提出了嚴重的「抗議」，於是商定只先拋二公尺石，那當然又把這部份工程拖遲了一個時間。其次說起柳枝楷料和工人的問題，也實在呌我們中國人慚愧。那些工程上所要用的開石機，打樁機，起重機，木樁，水泥，麵粉，甚至木船都由聯總從美國照期遝了過來，我們只要供給一些柳枝楷料和工人就是了。中國的鄉村確實是够窮了，柳枝楷料也是成了貴重的東西，要沿河八縣來照官價送售柳枝楷料，老百姓實在賠不起這個本，據說當時一車的柳枝楷料，要賠上四萬元左右；就是地方上有這些柳枝楷料，而同時老百姓也能賠得起本的話，那也沒有足够交通工具來運送，就像中牟一縣應送的柳枝楷料，依其全縣牛車小車來動員輸送，也得要一年半的時間。柳枝楷料成了問題，工程有時要瞪着眼不能進行。工人照道理是雇工的，不知怎的，一變而爲征工，同時工人因爲待遇太差，跑的跑，逃的逃，也是妨碍了工程的進度。至於工程方面的事，我們是外行，不敢說什麼。只聽他們自己說某顧問不應該硬打樁，打不下去怎麽又鋸了呢，硬要拋石下去可也不行，諸如此類的話也多得很，可見工程上也有問題在。</p>
<p>這些過去了事所以要寫下來，就是因爲要說明水勢是爭取了工程上的時候了。到了六月巾旬，黃河上游大漲，流量到了一萬七千秒立方公尺，而花園口堵口工程，在四千秒以上的流量就難以爲繼了。所以剛一打好的大木樁，一下子就被冲去了三分之一，於是功虧一簣宣吿失敗。</p>
<p>黃河水利委員會委員長趙守鈺辭了堵復局局長的兼差，換來的一位水利專家朱光彩。朱氏到了以後，這被衝去的木樁處的八公尺深的缺口，突然被水淘深得十八公尺。要補打木椿旣不行，要加緊拋石更不行，否則水會越淘越深，越流越急，這好像故意出了一個難題給新局長做，照朱局長說：這一情况要把它改善，比重新搞起來還困難，因爲當初的水位最深也不過八公尺，現在已經到了十八公尺；同時水集中在這深處奔流，旣湍又急，硬堵是絕對不來事。所以他的辦法是要使深處淤起來，同時要使水平勻去的流，至少分流一部份到旁邊提。爲了這，先要使水位平均的高，那末急處的水自會緩流，緩流成淤，深處也就被淤了，朱局長提高口門水位的辦法，就是在堵口後而三百五十公尺處，築起一道新橋來，那裏只有四公尺深的水位。道個新橋不僅可以提高口門水位，同時還是可以作爲堵口工程的第二道防綫，即是到了那堵口的舊橋沒有方法可以補樁拋石的時候，那就在新橋上另起爐灶堵口了。這條新橋築了以後，外間紛紛反對，認爲這是浪費，而且以爲舊橋工程之大甚於新橋尙不足以堵，那新橋還能濟事嗎？現在這新橋的效果，已經看出來了，水急的地方，緩流了，底下的十八公尺水深，已經減到十三公尺了。同時，這裏應該附帶說明，所以能使水勢改變的原因，在舊橋前面拋擲柳梱有附帶的作用。那柳梱總有二三丈長，裏面裏着大石塊，用二三百人把它一捆一捆堆到水裏去。眼前木椿二三天內就可以修補完成，以後繼續拋石的事情了。</p>
<p>堵復局現在感到頭痛的：不是柳枝楷料問題、因爲從改自購自運辦法以後，這困艱已經減輕了；也不是工人問題，因爲現在只要一萬多工人就够，他們的待遇也早改善了；現在最成問題，是石料。路局方面每天只能運到一列車石料，他們希望能够運到五六列車。石料，在堵復局方面認爲等於作戰彈藥，沒有足够石料，他們沒有方法作戰。</p>
<p>關於下遊與中共牽及的間題，這是十五萬萬元的河床上居民搬移費，是決定發的，只是技術上去研究如何發放了；下游復堤工程，黃委會趙委員長和美籍塔德顧問決定於最近期間偕中共代表趙明甫去山東勘察，究竟這工程已吾進行，進行到什麼程度，將來款項怎麽辦，都聽下回分解。</p>
<p>這次，黃河花園口決定在明年一月底前完成，否則凌汎時期一到，冰塊排山倒海而來，只是部份完成的工程就擋不住冰塊的衝激，那時不但工程吃了虧，恐怕黃泛區的新堤都難保，受禍不僅豫東而已，皖北也將因此陸沉了。這要看時間怎麽替堵口第二次作證了。</p>

<h3 id="c161">臺北看月蝕 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 八日臺北航訊　本報駐臺記者楊育</p>
<p>是晨曆十一月的望日，在下午五時前，滿天雲曇，還帶着濃重的雨意，然而一過了五時，天氣却顯得異樣明朗，預定今晚在中山堂台北天文合舉行的月蝕觀察招待會，料想一定可以開成，果真，老天真是幫忙，當我吃完了晚飯後，一輪晶瑩的明月，已經皓潔地掛在窗前的山項上面了。</p>
<p>趕到中山堂，裏面早擠滿了來參觀的人羣，一塊供簽名的白布上，已經寫得沒有一點空隙了，會塲裏正由台北氣象局的工作人員在向參觀者解釋天文常識：日蝕是月亮轉到地球與太陽之間所形成的現象，因爲月的體積小，所以在地球上的人不一定多能看到。月蝕是地球把月亮與太陽隔了開來所成的現象，許多地方多能看到，接着又把「台灣時間」加以一個簡單的說明，台灣經度一二〇度，是劃在中原時區裏的，這裏的時間與上海，南京，廣州等地多是一樣的，經度每隔十五度就劃爲一個時區，時間也就差一小時，例如重慶是在經度一〇五度，所以它的時間就比台灣，上海等地遲一小時。</p>
<p>臺灣香港那個準確</p>
<p>這些很普通而是很有趣的天文常識，就這樣輸入每一個與會者的腦中，事實上這是一種最實際的社會教育工作，從到會者的踴躍看來，也可知道這種工作確已收到不少効果，固然這種風氣的形成並不始自今日。</p>
<p>前幾天報上載着香港氣象局的報吿，說本月九日晨的月蝕自初蝕至復光，須六小時，較本年六月十五日的一次月蝕時間爲長，並且對月蝕的時間也加以一個詳細的推測。可是據台北氣象局天文科測算股王股長在會塲裏吿訴記者說，拿東經一二〇度的時間來算，我們測得道次月蝕的時間是初虧九日零時十分十一·八秒，全蝕開始，一時十八分四一，二秒，食甚一時四十七分五三秒，生光二時十七分四·八秒，復圓三時二十五分三十四，二秒，自初虧至復圓前後一共三小時十五分廿三秒，較本年六月十五日第一次月全蝕之時間短卅四分十三秒，所以他懷疑香港方面的報吿也許是錯誤的。好在這一個謎不久就會揭破，記者這樣自忖。</p>
<p>在天文常識解釋完了以後，離開實際觀測月蝕的時間還很畏久，氣象局設想得很週到，特地從美國新聞處方面借來了一部五彩的戰爭實錄影片「女戰士」，放映給與會者欣賞，藉以消磨這一段空着無聊的時間。</p>
<p>幾分幾秒不爽毫釐</p>
<p>在崖外的陽台架四吋半的折光望遠鏡和一鏡，多少人情願臥躺在水門汀上把眼睛湊在上面看得不肯罷休。</p>
<p>時閒一分一秒的過去，漸漸接近了今天最後一個節目，夜深風緊，然而大家站在陽台上誰也不覺得冷，只感到些有趣的緊張。八日道一天，眼望着它過去了，在九日〇時左右，經過招待人員的解釋靜靜地向天際望去。月面東綠，已漸入虛暗，顏色昏黃，有如繚繞的烟霧一般，到零時十分十二秒，地影吻上了月的邊緣，又無情地受進了她的面龐，這時候光度漸减。再到一時十八分四十二秒，終於月亮完全被地影吞噬，是開始全蝕了，大地暗得與朔日沒有兩樣，但在闇虛中，似乎月亮裏還有些微光，從望遠鏡裏看出去，月的週邊是微藍帶着綠色，內層作文玫瑰及紅銅色，最內的一層則呈深紅色，這據說是日光透過地球表面空氣屈折而生的蒙氣差，看到這裏不禁使我想起兒時在鄉間跟着人亂敲面盆小鑼的一幕滑稽動作來，月亮漸潮發光了，可是幾十年來多少人依然說是給鑼聲嚇出來的。</p>
<p>觀測的結果，月蝕時間與天文台用複雜的公式所計算的時間非常符合，雖然因爲望遠鏡實際上也不能看得十二分準確，但所差是不會超過五秒鐘的，這證明了香港方面的報吿是完全錯誤的。</p>

<p>— 嚴安手譯自本週雜誌</p>
<p>當我對我的柏林房東太太說我要到「敵區」（這是她對於德境蘇軍佔領區的稱呼）去的時候，她顯出很不安的樣子。「可憐的人啊！」她說道。「你將遭遇到最可怕的經騐了。」</p>
<p>我們去「鐵幕」背後的旅行是預先和蘇軍聯絡官接洽好的。我們一行—我自己和兩個朋友—可以自由訪問我們所歡喜訪問的各處地方。我們請求在我們接見德國人的時候，不要有蘇軍在旁監視，這個請求馬上獲得了准許。</p>
<p>我們駕着我們自己的汽車旅行，由一個俄國指導官作陪。這位鄉導官是一個很有禮貌的靑年，他的名字呌做維克多。維克多在我們巾間，使我們得到不少便宜，因爲我們的美國汽車，如果不是靠着他的威嚴的肩章的「牌頭一，一定會遭到蘇軍的攔阻。</p>
<p>在維克多的保護之下，我們在蘇軍控制的德國領土上通過了一千英里的地方。我們接見過德國的政治家，工人，小學敎師，管家婦，農人，報館編輯，市長和敎士等。我們和蘇聯軍政府官員，宣傳專家及便衣兵士們談話</p>
<p>在我的心巾有兩個基本問題：第一，爲什麽大多數德國人相信在俄人統治下的生活是混亂而不幸的。第二，俄國人在德國的基本政策是什麽。</p>
<p>第一個問題的答案很難找到。從柏林到特萊斯頓，我們一路經過的地方，看上去很安靜而豐饒。每一塊土地都有人墾植過。在我們的炸彈沒有炸到的工業中心區內，烟囪裘的烟冉冉上升。</p>
<p>糧食的情形怎麼樣呢？德國人遇到有人提起這個問題的時候，迅速地出示他們的配給證。我</p>
<p>覺得很奇怪：這　的大部份糧食配給較之德境佔領區其他部份多得不少—德國人對於這個事實似乎並沒有像我們那樣注意。只有肉類似乎以美軍佔領區爲最多。</p>
<p>然而蘇軍佔領區的人民看上去似乎並沒有吃得怎樣好。反之，他們大多數兩眼深陷，顯出飢餓的疲倦樣子。雖則你在美軍佔領區看不見多少肥胖的德國人，但在這裏連一個中等體重的德國人也不容易找到。</p>
<p>德人心驚胆怕</p>
<p>我們知道，這種現象原因很簡單：就是這裏差不多完全沒有黑市。在美軍控制的領域內，實際上每個人都從黑市方面得到額外的糧食，可是在這裏蘇軍佔領區內，人民不得不完全依靠配給所得的糧食爲生，因爲蘇軍的紀律很嚴厲，嚇得德國人不敢不服從。　此外，一切德國銀行的賬務暫時已被封鎖「以免通貨膨脹」。除了病人和老年人可以提取有限的存款之外，這裏的人民必須依靠實際工作所得到的錢來維持生活。</p>
<p>有不少德國人怨恨這種限制。但是看到這裏一切情形的井然有序，那末許多德國人所抱的反蘇成見，似乎有些不合理。</p>
<p>紅軍兵士的行爲怎樣呢？據我所交談的德國人，包括幾個老朋友，他們都承認：佔領軍的行爲還可稱爲令人滿意。他們吿訴我們說：「當然，有時也有騷擾的事件，但現在的情形，就此時此地的環境而論，差不多可算正常了。」</p>
<p>德國人畏　蘇聯　淸納粹份子的措施嗎？其實蘇聯的政策，對於這一點，沒有像美軍當局那樣嚴格。在美軍佔領區內，凡是屬於納粹黨或和納粹組織有關係的德國人，沒有一人能掌握一個負責的職位。但在這裏蘇軍佔領區內，以前的納粹份予，除了幾個「大亭」以外，只要他們　工作，並和俄國人誠心合作，馬上便可以得到饒赦。</p>
<p>雖然有這些事實，但是德國人仍繼續仇恨俄國人，這是歸源於郭培爾的宣傳。住在英美佔領區內的德國人，時常聽說俄國人都是吸血的魔王，，所以他們假定以爲蘇軍佔領區內的生活，完全是一片空怖。</p>
<p>在另一方面，大多數德國人以爲英美人都是和善而奢侈，有時稍帶一些可笑的性格。因此，蘇軍佔領區內的人都羨慕英美營巾的人民。他們以爲那裏每一個人都有很多的食物和游戲。</p>
<p>在我們所參觀的許多公立學校巾，我們找不出任何宣傳馬克思主義的微象。琪納大學敎務長左克敎授對我們說：蘇軍當局給于他以一切可能的協助，但並未千涉他的計劃。</p>
<p>俄國人雖有反德的情緒，但似乎很關心德國政治和文化的事務。不少西方觀察家，對於這個事實，也許不容易懂得。俄國人的用意是什麽呢？外傳關於未來蘇德聯盟以抗制歐陸的謠言，有沒有多少眞實性？</p>
<p>常然，局外人是無從知道克闌姆林的秘密計劃的。但是不論蘇聯最高政治當局所考慮的計劃是什麼，目前對於蘇德集圑的恐懼，說得溫和一些，可謂杞人憂天。</p>
<p>反蘇十字軍隊</p>
<p>俄國人顯然企圖加强德國的左翼份子。但是他們對於德國共產黨人，並不當作「同志」或可能的同盟看待，而視作代理人，僅足以協助佔領國的行政工作。</p>
<p>顯然，德國共產黨人很願意與俄國人駢肩向西方資本主義作戰。但是大多數的德國人，想到一個可能的第三次世界大戰的時候，大概幻想到一個反蘇十字軍，使他們的祖國在軍事上能够東山再起。</p>
<p>如果說一般的德國人寗願帮助毁滅蘇聯而不願與蘇聯駢肩作戰，那末一般的機國人，對於與德國一起向美國作戰的意見，也會一笑置之。因爲俄國人不喜歡德國人，但的確喜歡美國人，而對於美國的反蘇情緒，似乎完全不明白。</p>
<p>我們的俄國　導官維克多中尉對於這糧預示凶兆的緊張情形，完全沒有意識到。有一天傍晩的時候他說這：「看這班痴果的德國人怎樣注視着我們。他們看見你們美國人　在紅軍兵士中間，覺得非常驚異。他們以爲我們彼此都不喜歡。他們以爲我們之間將發生戰爭。他們一定發瘋了！」</p>
<p>希望和平未有惡感</p>
<p>很奇怪，我們在德國所遇到的美國兵，從他們的口中，我們聽到幾乎一樣的話語。這班美國兵　屬一個四十個人的分隊，這個分隊在過去五六個月，一向駐在蘇軍佔領區。</p>
<p>「你們都好嗎？」我們問他們。「祇有這幾人美國人雜處在那麽許多的俄國人中間嗎？」</p>
<p>他們異口同聲的答這：「我們中間從未有過惡感。他們並沒有給我們以任何麻煩。他們大多數是很好的大兵。他們的工作也不錯啊！」</p>
<p>有一個劃眼鏡的中年軍曹繼續着說道：「有些人似乎覺得德闖人很像美國人。我絕對不以爲然。其實俄國人比較德國人更像我們！」</p>
<p>另一個美國大兵，一個來自美國中西部的靑年，聳着他的肩頭，顯出輕視的態度說這：「這班德國人一定是有神經病的——以爲俄國人和我們之間將發生一次戰爭。這是什麼想法！我對於政治不大知道，但我的確知道俄國人。據我所知道，他們沒有什麽毛病。那末，我們之間怎麽會打起來呢？」</p>

<p>紐約四國外長會議，在友好和洽的空氣巾，完成了她的歷史的任務之後，已於本月十二日圓滿結束了。其所通過的決議，最重要的有兩個：（一）將巴黎和會所通過的對義羅匈保芬五國的和的草案，核准通過；並定於明年二月十日在巴黎簽字成立；屆時這五個國家，就可以恢復正常狀態了。（二）決定下屆四國外長會議於明年三月十日在莫斯科舉行，討論對德奧兩國的和的草案。所以我們對於四國外長會議的成就，不能不認爲對於今後的局勢，將有重大的發展，至少可使一九四六年獲得一平靜的歸趨。</p>
<p>當英國外相貝文自紐約離啓返國之際，曾向報界發表談話稱：「和平的旭日，正在昇起來了；四强間的誤解消散，保證各國向前邁進，造成永久和平的基礎。」</p>
<p>聯大也有重大成就</p>
<p>聯合國大會第二屆會議，也於本月十四日通過「裁軍大憲章」之後，宣吿圓滿結束了。這次聯合國大會，討論的範圍，非常廣泛，例如有（一）西理牙弗朗哥政權問題；（二）安全理事會常任理事國行施否決權問題；（三）調查各國國外駛軍問題；（四）普遍裁减軍備問題，均已獲得協議，其中最重大的成就，還在裁减軍備問題，通過了一種「裁軍大憲章」，其要點如下：（一）聯合國大會承認目下有迅速實行普遍裁軍之必要。（二）促請安全理事會根據工作之　急，採納一切實際與必要之措置，藉以達成此一目的。安全理事會爲此所起草之各項計劃，應送達聯合國各會員國，再由聯合國大會召開特別會議，加以審議。（三）促請原子能委員會應即通過管制原子能之辦法。使其用途，限於和平方面。（四）聯合國各國應以軍隊交安全理事會指揮，以維持世界和平。</p>
<p>法國內閣在難產中</p>
<p>法國國民大會第一次投票，共產黨候選人多萊士落選了，第二次投票，人民共和黨候選人比杜爾也落選了。那末由什麽人出來負此艱鉅呢？戰後的法國，千孔百瘡，尤其是財政方面，問題重重，急待解決，目前的政潮，決不能長此拖延下去的。因此各黨派領袖會商的結果，乃一致擁護社會黨領袖勃魯姆東山再出。國民大會舉行第三次投票時，勃魯姆就當選爲內閣總理。</p>
<p>法國的政治雖然進步了，但仍未能擺脫了過去小議林立的作風，社會黨是法國的第三政黨勃魯姆的出任艱距，完全靠了其他各黨的協議，其基礎當然非常脆弱，不言可知。但是法國目前的問題，一是財政金融問題，二是外交問題，非有像勃魯姆那樣傑出的老政治家，決不能勝任的，惟截至目下爲止，勃魯姆內閣尙在難產中。先天旣不足，後天又失調，又怎能希望他成長，爲法國復興開闢一條新的途徑呢？所以我們對於法國的前途，仍不敢過分樂觀呢？</p>

<p>加州大學的科學家們近來已經把守護戰時秘密的栅欄降低，首次允許新聞記者和攝影師們走進裝斯新近完成的一百八十四英寸大原子分裂機的巨大圓形透風屋子。</p>
<p>記者們發覺原子物理學家生活在另外一個他們自己所形成的世界裏，並且有着他們自己的語言，即使是一個單音節的字，在外行人看起來也會感到陌生。對於這次參觀，新聞記者們所得的印象極深，但是所得到的知識却非常之少。</p>
<p>在這建築物的一間大房問裏，充滿了穿着白色工作服顯得非常誠摯的靑年人。他們全都忙於條補那個鋼鐵做的龐然大物。它巍然聳峙，高度一直達到圓形的屋頂。</p>
<p>「這個」，引導參觀的人說，「就是原子分裂機。」</p>
<p>你要把它忽略過去是不可能的，這座發出四千噸大電磁力，漆着淡黃色的原子分裂機形狀看上去就好像一個巨大的外國滴漏，這個大滴漏由長方形的眞空鋼鐵箱分隔成上下兩部分；箱上裝有巧妙的類似船艙上的窗眼，使物理學家們可以由此而看到裏面原子分裂的情形。</p>
<p>這座新的原子分裂機所添增的力量三倍於以前任何同類的機械。原子的整個分解希望能够籍以完成，而不僅是像以前所做過的把原子部份地「削」出微粒。</p>
<p>參觀引導人指出當你走近這部機器的時候，它的磁性對於你鞋子上釘子的吸引力，會使你覺得雙脚似乎每隻有十磅之重，「你身上全部的硬幣和錀匙均將自袋底升起，飛貼在口袋邊上。這是一個非常奇特的感覺。」他又說。</p>
<p>主持這座原子分裂機的物理學家考克賽博士說，他和他的同事們尙未開始走向任何可與戰時原子彈相比擬的原子能或者宇宙能平時應用的研究目標。</p>
<p>「這項研究」他說，「還在非常原始的階段，我們現在所從事的一切工作僅是試着想對這種能量多知道一點，它平時應用的實現尙有待於將來。」</p>

<p>斐列浦馬列遜博士是一位美國的靑年科學家，他曾經參加原子彈研究和製造工作，戰後首先偕同專家去日本觀察原子彈所造　的損害，在廣島遇見日本理化學院敎授吉雄西野，得知吉雄正悉心研究原子能，但其實騐室却又簡陋得可憐，他沒有像英美科學家所有的精良器械，僅有些本國製的儀器，論其價值不致超過美金二十元，節直比英美等國一個巾學生家庭實騐室還差，他父沒有機會看到史密賽報吿——美國軍部公報，曾刊載不少（不是全部）原子彈製造秘密——可作爲參考的，不過是一片炸後廣島的形象，藉破壞的程度，探求原子彈秘密，他蒐集了一切關於原子上的理論，繪製了許多有價值的圖畫，其數量之多與範圍之廣，令人驚異，其中尙有不少爲英美以外各國所未知者。由於他研究時速度的高，路綫的正確，誰相信是從價值二十美元之實騐室的產品，馬氏驚嘆之餘，深信如果讓吉雄有精良的設備，更多的查料，必可在短時期內趕上英美，探知所有關於原子能的秘密。馬列遜博士最後稱：「原子秘密不足恃，唯一的保障祇有共管原子能和國際諒解！」</p>

<p>— —蕭夫十一月一日倫敦航訊—</p>
<p>英國在大戰之後，力圖振興，國內工業在加緊生產，生產出來的物品預備外運，以換取所需要的物資。在航空方面，亦力爭上流，想與美國抗衡，並有取得航空覇權的雄圖。</p>
<p>英國的飛機工塲加緊製造新的飛機，在速度方面和容量方面均力求進步。現在橫穿大西洋最快的飛機，從紐約到倫敦，平均速度爲二百二十英里。趕上順風，還可更快一點，從紐約到倫敦只要十四小時。</p>
<p>再過幾年，據航空專家的預測，紐約到倫敦的商運以要七小時或者不到七小時，速度增加到每小時五百英里。十年之後，倫敦與紐約的飛行，有縮短到二小時半到三小時的可能。兩處的商人可以乘坐飛機商談一件生意了。</p>
<p>每小時五百哩</p>
<p>英國現在設計的飛機，速度爲每小時五百英里，高度由三萬尺到四萬尺。但在一兩年之內，恐怕不能大量出現。分別說來，英國　備製造的商用飛機，大槪有三種。第一種是兩個引擎的飛機，可載乘客二十至三十人，速度每小時四百英里。該機速度甚高，專作歐洲各大城市飛行之用，從倫敦至柏林只要兩小時，到莫斯科只要四小時。大槪明年即可完成。</p>
<p>第二種是四個引擎的飛機。速度每小時三百五十英里。可載乘客六十五人。這類飛機預備與美國的橫穿大西洋及太平洋的飛機競爭。第三種名爲「飛翼」，亦是四個引擎。重的九十五噸，速度爲六百英里，從倫敦到紐約尙不到七小時。</p>
<p>此外飛機加多，必須增加機塲。長的跑道，佔很多的地方。所以想造航空飛船，作爲機塲之用。如此，則機塲的問題亦可解決了。</p>
<p>英國新設計的飛機已引起世界的注意，有幾個國家已向英國訂購。美國在最近亦有仿製的可能。英國的新飛機是用Gasturbne氣體渦輪式，美國還是用活塞式Piston—type時不致更改。因爲美國商人在這上面投下幾百萬的資本。或許在六七年以後，美國的商用航空才大量的製造英國式的飛機。</p>
<p>美國決不落後</p>
<p>美國亦在設計，新式的飛機，並在試驗與製造中。美國相信，他的航空　權不會爲英國人搶去，美國自信能執世界航空牛耳者，仗着下列幾種飛機。</p>
<p>第一是四引擎的飛機，速度每小時的爲四百英里。載客的容量的爲爲四十六至一百八十人。</p>
<p>第二種是六引擎的。可載乘客四百人。航程爲一萬英里。飛船亦在製造中。有些是作戰時海軍用的，現在正改爲商用。不但飛船是如此。有些運客的海船，也是戰時運兵用的。即如本年七八月間由上海開出的客船，即其一例，而且乘客要担任工作，如掃地，洗碗，一如戰時士兵之所爲。由這點看來，戰爭的尾聲似乎未盡。完全復員恐怕尙須時日，美國亦在研究「飛翼」式的飛機，能否成功，就看現在「飛行速度超過聲音速度」的試騐的成績爲定。</p>
<p>國相信這類飛機可與英國的Gas　turbine氣體渦輪式飛機相比甚而超過之。英美兩國都在設計「超過聲音速度」的飛機。飛機的速度已經近乎聲音的速度了—聲音的速度是每小時七百七十里（普通溫度內），不過在這樣高的速度下，其震動的影響如何，尙少研究。</p>
<p>美國打破聲音速度的飛行試騐，最近或有重要的消息發表。現擬用一火箭發動的飛機，升高至七萬至八萬尺的高度。如果這個試騐能夠成功，則商用航空，不愁小時不能有一千英里的速　了。那樣，世界上任何地方在十二小時內均可到達。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c169">記十年來之大千 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 張目寒</p>
<p>滬上人士不見大千之畫，已近十年，在此十年中，大千於藝術造詣之探邃及其人格修養之偉大，可足稱述者實多，僅就目寒所知，的略舉其犖犖大者言之。</p>
<p>七七事變前數日，大千方由南京抵北平，詎意征塵甫卸，蘆溝事起，不得已潛居頤和閱中，藉詩畫遺其悲憤，旋敵軍入踞故都，大事益不堪問；而平西一帶，寇燄肆虐日甚，即頤和園亦時爲所擾，大千悲憤塡膺，誓與同盡，乃有西友某君，甘冒險阻，馳車入園，强挽之入城，至是激於忠義亟謀南行，然以鏖氛飄簸，道路梗塞，欲歸不得矣。其時余居皖西故里，屢得大千書，輒以身寄北方，未能遽歸爲苦，二十七年夏末，大千計遺其眷屬携所藏名作先離北平，已而翩然至津，遂間關山海，輾轉至渝，其卒能脫敵人之環伺而不爲所獲，足見大千之智勇也。於時相見之下，悲喜交集，談及舊日姑蘇白下之樂，恍如隔世。廿七年冬，大千在渝，作畫數十幅，爲前方戰士　金，時渝中人士，敬服大千偉大人格，均渴望其丰采，而其所作之畫，竟於三小時內，競購一空，得金數千元，悉用爲將士寒衣之資。</p>
<p>嗣遊靑城，俯仰靈秀，所作益多，觀其氣韵運成天骨高古，置之宋元人中，誠足過之，蓋其天才絕人，復孜孜不息，蔚爲一代大家，蚩偶然哉。大千在靑城時，曾函邀余，備言山中風物淸麗，氣象萬千，足使胸巾豁然淸朗，余爲之動，遂決計前往一遊，藉傾積怵！迨抵靑城，果如大千言，於亦雄亦奇亦秀外，而其幽邃曲深，似劍閣三峽峨嵋，皆不遜色，（吳稚老語）其風雨晦明，四時之景不同，陰晴變幻，朝夕之象迴殊；尤以趙公山下八卦台上之雲氣、瞬息萬變，一極大自然之奇觀，大千日夕對景精　，盡收入筆端，至山巾一花一木，一鳥一蝶，俱詳其物情物理物態，一一爲之寫生。</p>
<p>復相偕北避劍門，見山截野橫，天　峽倒，長嘯高歌，大有獨立蒼茫之槪！大千得詩云：「北去南來間石牛，蜀王引領五丁休，蕩搖白日龍虵怒，椎　玄天神鬼愁，自是山川據形勝，誰言關塞限戈矛，諸公忍作新亭泣，一戰猶堪扼此州。」聲調高亢，意允沈鬱，與工部劍門詩，有與曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>大千又因峨嵋秀絕，終歲在雲嵐烟　中，大似北苑南宮畫法，若欲求其天機離合之趣，非置身其中不可，遂決計登其絕頂，其遊峨嵋金頂詩運：「千重　嶺栖靈駕，一片銀濤護寳航，五岳歸來恣坐臥，忽驚神秀在西方。」</p>
<p>峨嵋歸來後，有感於敦煌爲吾國寳藏靈區，其莫高窟中壁畫，均六朝隋唐人手筆，　往之心已久，因於二十九年冬，西出嘉峪，禮佛敦煌，遂就此悉意研究繪事，歷有三載，處此烽烟擾攘之時，而　　鳴沙有室之巾，其精神至可佩仰。而其作風，亦爲之大變，無一畫無出處，無一筆無來歷，夫畫者意態之所聚，天機之所寓，蓋欲盡其意態，必本之於學；欲透其天機，必具有其才，才者天之所賦，不可強得，然有其才而無學，或學而不勤，皆未能期其成就，今大千雖取徑於六朝隋唐，而獨能筆墨揮灑，深厚雄鬱，不滯於機，不泥於法，匪特雄視一世，誠足起八代之衰也。</p>
<p>去秋窮寇摧伏，大千欣然而喜曰：「晦昧之區，重　天日，余之　亦將以供京滬人士之賞　矣。」京滬人士，不忘大千，而大千於京滬人士，固未當忘　也。至其生平偽人，亦正同其作畫之風格，　邁疏　，一本其忘機之趣，過有名畫，雖千萬金亦所不惜，友朋有急難，解　相救，略無吝色，有古君子之風。馮若飛君曾贈以聯謂「富可敵國，貧無立錐。」沈尹默先生復贈以詩云：「張子之當可敵國，張子之貧無立錐；旣富且貧人莫曉，但見滿漸霜髯姿。　服太白欠飲酒，　林東坡少賦詩；丹靑平生性所好，不辭人前稱畫師。六法近壞了無法，衆史秉筆心恰恰，君子與境得發揮，未輸瞿塘愧巫峽；淸猿凄切最能吟，白鷗浩蕩還相狎；身輕萬里行敦煌，囊括六代兼三唐；歸開一室但四壁，千佛寫畢自焚香。」些聯此詩，洵足爲大千寫照，今大千之　，已展覽於春申矣，滬上多賢士大夫，觀其諸作，或有契於余言者乎？</p>

<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>有一天晚上，英國文化委負會，賀德立先生G．Hedley到我家裏來，談及最近該會將要舉行一次英國刻畫展覽會。（Exhibition　of　Graphic　Art）和我商量展覽的地點，我推薦了交通便利，市中心區南京路的大新畫廊，使觀衆易於集中欣賞英國的藝術。使我回憶十六年前，一九三〇年的八月，我由巴黎到倫敦消夏，參觀　家美術院（Royal　Academy）展覽。代表學院派作風的英國藝苑，給我的印象是構圖莊重謹嚴，設色沉雄典麗，用國畫上的術語來說，是偉麗精工，下筆不茍；似乎缺少一種潑辣自由的發揮。這也許是英國國民性富於保守的形成，與法國作風稍異其趣。</p>
<p>這一次的小型展覽，作品只有五十件，包括蝕刻，染刻，鏤刻，金屬刻，套色木刻等，其中以蝕刻，奈斯高氏（Job　Nixon）出品，十三號「鄉村風景」，斯出勞氏（Strang）的「聖保羅大敎堂」，及十五號「戰爭」，十六號「蕭翁造象」，十七號泰勞氏（Taylor）「出浴」，及二十四號都德氏（F．Dodd）出品「畫家杭德肖像」，線條嚴謹，表現精到，最爲出色。（附圖）都德氏，生於一八七四，現年七十二歲，早年畢業皇家美術院，爲英國當代名畫家之一。</p>
<p>尙有線刻，木雕，如二十九號戈登氏（S．Gooden）之「雙馬」。二十號「舞蹈」，及四十二號「水城」，均屬妙品。其餘套色木刻諸幅，作風新穎，富原始藝術趣味，但技術平常，不若年來蘇聯木刻界的精進。</p>
<p>石刻，木刻，在吾國起源甚古，如漢代孝堂山石刻，武梁祠石刻，著名字內。而木刻尤爲發達，代有精作流傳，一直影響到日本近代的浮世繪，借以近百年來，無多進步。不若歐洲除石刻，木刻外，尙有蝕刻，染刻，鏤刻，線刻，石印刻等的精進。這一次英國刻畫展覽，代表過去一百五十年間，刻版在藝術上偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>美國文化委員會，拿這一次展覽的內容，印了一册精美的目錄，關於刻畫的歷史，名家作品的介紹；和雕刻術種類的分別，詳細說明，除表現藝術上的貢獻外，尙有提倡工藝美術的意味，這是值得我們注意的。因爲工藝美術，是提高人類文化，促進美化人生的唯一利器。</p>

<p>「還有嗎？」萍子有些囁嚅嚅，說不出口的樣子；但立刻又好像鼓足了勇氣似的，「火哥，萬一……我把這三個問題答覆之後，萬一……這三方面，當然連我在內，——這三方面的立塲，恰巧與你的主張相反，都是背道而她的，在你，對於我的一切，自然都明瞭了；可是我對於你的一切，却于點也不知通；到那時候，你想我還有希望嗎？……」</p>
<p>「那一類的希望？」　見並非不知道萍子所能希望，是指着戀愛而言，然而却非明知故問，鶴見還不至於如此狡猾卑鄙，他因本情關係太大，其中不能有一絲的含胡，所以必得問個淸楚明白。</p>
<p>「大哥，我的心事，在我們見面以來，這二十小時內，我的行動言語，已經表示得很明白，也許大哥沒有把這點表示，看得重要，但我個人方面，認爲很嚴重——大哥在大陸上工作了五六年，常然有不少女性的追逐，大哥心目中，也許有極合理的對象，也許不止一個。不過我所要求的，要火哥也允許我參加一份子，作一個競選的之一。失敗與勝利，眼前我顧不到，將來也決不計較。……縱然失敗的話！」萍子說着，頭漸漸低下，聲音也愈說愈低，含着幾分怨切的意味。</p>
<p>鶴見聽了這些求愛的話，心下想必也起了一些同情的共鳴，似乎不忍再聽下去，當即離開萍子，回身走開，在三四步的距離處，來回走着。萍子仍舊俯首呆怔怔的站在當地，好像一個期待宣佈中選與吾的志願兵。鶴見來回　蹀了好一會，重又回到萍子身邊來：</p>
<p>「萍子，你這兩個問題，都呌我碍難答覆，又可，我終得答覆你，不是嗎？第一個問題，你把你和青木長老，等等的意嚮說明出來，你認爲是出賣秘密，我却以爲僅僅是一些友誼上的指導。本來我可以不必這樣向你直接探問，至多也只要再費幾小時工夫，和幾句問接言語就可探明出來。但如今旣然問到你頭上，你又認爲是出賣秘密，出賣與吾的責任，那是要你自己担負的。……</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>取之於民，用之於民。十分正當，而且誰也擁護。不過民窮而荷包空空，不能說「我還是花在你們身上」而强取豪奪。外國記者稱頌過吳市長的一句名言：殺了鷄是喫不到鷄蛋的。如果捐稅已把人民逼死，這筆錢募第到手又花在誰身上呢？</p>
<p>比如房捐，我住的那幢弄堂破房子，地僻處江灣路，這一季就得擻納三萬幾千元，我這個人一向很糊塗，又怕麻煩，且更衷誠服從功令，通知到了的第二天，便乖乘巧巧地去繳納，等到繳納以後，仔細一想，這個負擔實在太重了。平均每月近萬元的房捐，對於個人收入，這是一個怎樣的比例呀！而且，平均每幢房子以每月一萬元計，全上海如果算它五十萬幢，每月房捐一項，市府的收入豈不有五十億，够驚人的了！</p>
<p>還有，書業的營業稅，現在財政部的決定，是敎科書可豁免，其意若日，別的書是不應該優待的，這也極不合理的。近來書業一天比一天不景氣，根本已面臨無法維持的局面，即使免去營業稅，還要舉辦文化貸款，才能使他們站得住，否則，祗有全體關門一條路。抗戰八年，文化已經受摧殘，知識水準的降落，看看今日的各級學校學生，實在可怕。如何急起直追，設法補救，這是出版界的查任，更是政府當局的責任。</p>
<p>再，還有所得稅，其計算方法，也很值得研究。</p>
<p>昨天市參議會對於市政建設捐（房捐）已有新的決定，冬季不加倍，並照秋季再減三分之一，這實在是一　明的措置，爲人民說了話，在謀求減輕人民的負擔。同時市財政當局也在表示，市民如對估值有意見，儘可請求重新估定。</p>
<p>「政府死要錢」道一說法很流行，當局千萬要考慮到人民能負擔得起，否則這一說法便眞的成爲事實而流傳更廣了。</p>

<p>— 沈伯馨譯自十二月份「續者文摘」。</p>
<p>原子筆在上海市塲上，已經有幾種牌子了。它的長處已經見到幾篇文字介紹過，下面且談一些發明史的片段和製造商競爭的情形。</p>
<p>原子筆胚胎於匈牙利。發明渚是一位多才善變的退伍軍人拜羅，他曾習醫，且擅繪，能文。不滿於自來水筆的種種缺點，他便和他的哥哥化學師喬治開始研究創製較好的書寫工具。最初設計的形式頗爲笨重，其後於一九三九年在巴黎繼續試騐，不久大戰爆發，拜羅乃於一九四〇年六月流亡至南美的布諾斯愛利斯，當時資斧已罄，他在阿根廷遍覓資本家，結果有一個阿根廷人和一側英國人對於他的製筆計劃發生興趣，予以資助。</p>
<p>直至一九四三年，才在阿根廷製成第一枝，他開始採用毛細管作用的供墨系，獲得成功。</p>
<p>機會正巧</p>
<p>在一九四三年歲杪，有一枝拜羅所製的筆，由航郵寄達紐約Ebcrhard　Febar廠（該廠以　鉛筆等著名）總理繆塞氐；經其一試，旋即擱置，但是繆塞每隔幾天必要再試一次。最後，他便交給他的工程司們研究，一九四四年五月間他前往南美開始商購此種新筆在美產銷權。正巧那時軍部表示有意購買一萬枝不漏的墨水筆（因爲普通水筆在高空因空氣壓力小墨水會自動流出）供空軍應用，於是製筆的三大名廠，愛弗釋，犀飛利和派克乃同時和E．Faper廠鼓購此項在美產銷權，逐鹿結果，愛勿釋以最高代價獲勝——計較E．Faber廠所出之二十萬美元之數高出三十萬美元，且於在美銷售所人項下提給發明人百分之五又因分之一。該廠立即動員工程司改良原子筆之構造，同時積極進向宣傳。</p>
<p>正在那時刻，紐約Gimbcl百貨商店於十月間刋登廣吿略稱；「喧傳已久的新奇墨水筆，已在本店開始發售」。一般人都以爲那必定是匈牙利人所發明的一　。其實非然，愛勿釋廠還在苦心孤詣地試騐新筆，型式尚在改進　。那百貨店所賣的是另一位捷足先登的朋友雷諾氐（Miltou　Rcynolsds）所製。</p>
<p>善於經商</p>
<p>雷諾氏現年五十四歲，少時經營車胎頗爲得法，他在二十六歲時已成巨當，二十七歲時旋吿破產。此後，乍富乍貧。在此次戰爭中，他曾由墨西哥運美銀質打火機廿五萬只，旋即銷售一空，獲利百萬。</p>
<p>一九四五年四月間雷氐在布諾斯愛利斯一商塲內，見到有原子筆發售，他就購取了半打，回國後立即邀集工程司和孰諳專利權法規的律師會同研究，結果認爲可以避免利用拜羅所請准專利的構造製成鋼珠筆。他在匆促之中，搶在愛勿釋之前，完成了一種型式。在十月廿九日那一天Gimbel百貨店在紐約售出當氏的筆計六萬元，一星期內，銷售二萬五千枝，每枝十二元五角，同時雷氐的事務所戶限爲穿。</p>
<p>雷氏更大事宣傳。他提出了三萬三千元獎金舉辦原子筆陳列競賽。結果，有五千家商店參加。他還提出許多獎品鼓勵推銷。獎品種類極多，自家用洗滌機以至珍珠項練，四色彩版印成的獎品目錄計有四十八頁。第一年間所耗宣傳費用竟達八十四萬八千元之鉅。有一時期，雷諾氏專派一人向政治家，報人，以及社會聞人分贈原子筆。他本人曾飛往世界各處；計劃在英，法，澳等地開設分廠，沿途並曾作成交易頗多，有一次在橫渡印度洋的飛機的盥洗室裏向同行某旅客表演以原子筆在薄紙（衛生紙之類）上書寫，結果，接獲數量很大的定單。</p>
<p>當雷諾氐從原子筆上大　其錢時，其他的製造商已從事準備在質的方面壓倒他。的確，雷諾原子筆是有使人不滿的缺點，在七個月內，被退回的有十萬四千六百四十三枝。愛弗釋廠在研究工作上耗資二百萬元。犀飛利廠會試騐過五千次，包括不同的型式三十種。派克廠的試騐費用也近三十萬元。愛弗釋的「CA」筆遲至四月間出現市塲，售價十五元，同時作大規模的宣傳。</p>
<p>宣傳有方</p>
<p>愛弗釋的推銷員有種種的技巧，例如，傾水在寫字　上，在水裏寫字，抹去水蹟，字仍存在。還有表演在細薄的麻紗手帕上寫字，或者用力搖甩原子筆，以示不漏等等。</p>
<p>愛弗釋廠估計一九四六年的銷額可達二千萬元，那麽拜羅所抽的發明稅，將有一百萬元以上。</p>
<p>現在，原子筆的戰鬥正在如火如茶，已經有五六起控訴於法庭。雷諾氏控吿愛弗釋廠和E．Faber廠違反「反託拉斯法令」，要求賠償一百萬元。而該兩廠亦反訴霄諾氏要求賠償一百萬元，控其「竊佔」他們所準備的市塲。今年各筆廠共計約耗三百萬元從事於宣傳，其廣吿大部份是相互針對的。當犀飛利的原子筆出世時，廣吿的標題有「並非尙禾長成的—已經完備了的！」等語。</p>
<p>現在愛弗釋廠已經製成五六種顏色的墨水，可以選所喜歡的顏色芯子換上去。</p>
<p>同時售價低廉的牌子，也紛紛出現了。現在美國各廠每天的總量大槪是六萬枝以上。</p>
<p>拜羅所發明的筆，的確是書寫工具的一個劃時代大轉變。過去若干年來的瞎摸探索，現在的爭鬥。這都是我們爭取進步所付的一部份代價。</p>

<p>— 徵玲譯</p>
<p>一位敎師企圖作一個重要的科學實騐，可是無法進行，於是去訪富翁，但遭了拒絕。他們之間開始了如下的談話：</p>
<p>當翁：「眞奇怪，只看見教師先生們總來找當翁，却從沒見過當翁去找敎師？」</p>
<p>敎師：「因爲敎師明白自己沒有錢，可是富翁却絕沒想到他們缺乏學問，」</p>
<p>富翁：「那麽何以當富翁們情情願願地去救濟瞎子。破子等類殘廢，却不歡喜幫助窮敎師們呢？」</p>
<p>敎師：「因爲他們恐怕將來可能變成瞎子·跛子等等，可是却絕不會變成敎師！」</p>

<h3 id="c180">叫花子的組織18 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>流血·挨血</p>
<p>惡丐登門「掛彩」之後，出事的店戶或住家自然慌張起來。因爲這乞丐爲了要不到　　流血，顯然錯處在我。於是以好忍痛多給，饜其所欲而去。丐流便扶着血肉模糊的頭臉又走到鄰家門口。這時必有許多小孩和路人跟隨在旁。店家見此猙獰的面目，也不願意此輩久留鬥外，只好急急給資打發。於是又到第三第四家。一次「掛彩」，得錢極易。但每次祗向馬路的一邊乞討，同日絕對不討對街的店家。該幫之所以採用強硬呌化的原故，是因爲自信先前的皇帝特許他們「逢門可乞」的。不給他錢，其錯處乃在民家。該幫還有一種硬法，除了乞錢之外，其他的日用物器，如柴米油鹽之類，有缺欠時，也可向人家「攤派」。</p>
<p>這種流血的苦肉計，在平常人想像起來自然是可怕的。尤其是每次要流不少的血，似乎有　健康，非休養多日不能復原，但丐幫中人却視爲家常便飯，因爲他們經過特殊的訓練，從小吞食各種五檅六　，和江湖特有的秘方。他們練成了破額的慣習，雖皮肉受創而不覺痛楚。事實上，他們的印堂額骨早已敲破，成爲一個大窟　了。每次掛彩流了一些血，創口却極易合縫。下次再「破土」時，却仍是舊創穴，表面上祇流些血，但見者却相驚伯有，認爲額骨敲破，事態嚴重了。</p>
<p>爲了上海地面遼闊之故，丐頭便支配爲若干區械，各設頭目管理屬丐。其中輩數高低可分爲七八級。但無論任何小組出外「做街」（乞討也）或「單刀赴會」（獨自行乞），每日所入的錢都得交帳。然後按成數分給。其分配成數視輩級而有等差。高級丐可分得五成，（即百份之五十）。低級的竟有祇得二成者。丐頭坐享八成之多，眞是極　削能事了。可時在丐頭方面也說得振振有詞。因爲在前此都有丐廠，一應食宿開支都由丐頭支配。若逢隆冬雨霧交加時，丐流疾病時，都可免予出外「做街」，但粥　却照舊供應。低級丐多半是能力低微之輩，所入極爲有限。但飯量却無異恒丐，自非施行重　榨取不可了。</p>
<p>「硬採」丐流對於每”應交之款，絕對不許短少，而且也絕對不敢短少。一班初出山的新乞丐，以爲丐頭眼目不周，怎能曉得我每日乞討多少，於是故意暗藏一部份起來，誰知一日瞞過，久後亦必破案。丐頭初覺交帳太少，已加注意。一看神色不對，便施行全身搜查，於是「懷　」構成了罪案，須受刑　。</p>

<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>前任廣州市長陳策將軍，卸任後即取道人京，初傳將出任海軍副總司令，事後證明不確。最近忽又傳說這一位年已五十三的海軍宿將，有出長僑務委員會的可能，是否確實，待政府改組後，自可分曉。</p>
<p>陳將軍號　碩，廣東省海南島琼山縣人，黃埔水師學堂卒業，歷任海軍要職，性格風流倜儻，不拘形跡，提起「策叔」的大號，華南一帶知名。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事未爆發前，陳將軍適居香島任國民黨港澳總支部主任委員，香港陷落前，陳氏藉運動健將徐亭的援助，泅水渡海，得以脫險，轉入重慶·這一段故事，爲抗戰中一著名揷曲子。</p>
<p>陳氏，一足已廢，但裝有假足，係英國醫師設計，行動靈活，竟與常人無異，穿了西裝長褲，簡直絲毫省不出破綻。</p>
<p>十餘年前，中央權力尙未達到兩粵，陳氐已心傾中央，因和當日的「天南王」陳濟棠失和，但是爲了籌碩先生在粵省也有相當的威望，不可一世的「天南王」竟也奈何他不得。</p>
<p>勝利前，陳將軍即已奉派充任廣州市長，在任不及一年，即懇請辭職。據說求去的原因是爲了和頂頭上司羅卓英省主席，意見發生衝突，一怒掛冠，不愧軍人本色。</p>
<p>將軍頗得孫哲生院長的器重，他和民治黨領袖司徒美棠也很投契。</p>
<p>目前，陳將軍還逗留在京，大約是等候中福新的任命吧。</p>
<h3 id="c182">是誰　誤人子弟？ <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 許明</p>
<p>在本刊拜讀了聖潔和方成兩位先生對「誤人子弟」的高見後，覺得他們一個是以學生的立塲來發言，一個是以敎師的處境來「辯護」，雙方都不無他們自己主觀上的理由；但是，事實上他們都忽略了一個造成「誤人子弟」的主要人物，如果用今日的房屋糾紛來打個譬喻，聖潔先生像是三房客，出了高額的房租，住不到好房子；方成先生像個大房東，有着好房子收不到相當的租金，原因就是大房東與三房客之間，有了一個黑心的二房東從中牟利。聖潔和方成兩位先生就忽略了等於二房東的學店老闆，這個造成「誤人子弟」的主要人物。</p>
<p>「鬼混」式的敎師應該滾出學校的大門，在學生的立塲來說，是絕對沒有絲毫錯誤，而且是天經地義的要求，但學店老闆們却正歡迎着道種敎師，唯一的理由是這種敎師可以用最低廉的代價請到，這樣一來，學店老闆就可以將學費收入的一小部份作爲敎師的薪給，而將大部份的學費收入用作投機買賣的資本，或從事高利貸的吸血工作。在利令智昏之下，辦學校在學店老闆的腦子裏，是籌劃投機資本的工具，學生的學業與敎師的生活自然都不在他們的「顧及」中了。</p>
<p>敎師生活的淸苦，在今日是不可諱言的事實，敎師爲維持生活而多兼課務，致使「誤人子弟」。在理論上說，這是不應該有的，但在事實上是一種生活的需要；但造成敎師不得不爲生活上的需要而多兼課務，致使「誤人子弟」的「劊子手」，是以賺錢爲辦學校目的之學店老闆。現在還可以舉出兩個實例來說明：有一個姓王的在××路上開了一間中小學，把學費收入四千多萬元在外放收拆息，不料吃了「倒賬」，無法「另請高就」的敎員就祗得「含辛茹苦」，「苦渡春秋」，跟道倒足霉頭的老闆「枵腹從公」。又有一個姓沈的，在××路上開了一間中小學，請的敎員大部份不是同鄉便是親戚，不是校長太太的「乾兒子」，便是校長老爺的「過房媛」。大家都是「帮忙性質」，「隨便給幾鈿」的寳實。其他實在無法包辦的功課才不得不請「外頭人」，因此「外頭人」就得等校長將學　放出，收到拆息後才得　到薪水。這些事實都是說明敎師之苦，都來自校長的剝削。然則，事實不就很明白了嗎？「誤人子弟」的眞正罪魁，究竟是誰？</p>
<p>在上海這許多學校中，雖然有許多「誤人子弟」的學店，但也頗多質在埋頭爲作育人材在努力的學校，故爲解決「誤人子弟」這個問題，我建議：請新聞記者爲我們的第二代。調查一下本市所有學校的實際情形，好的壞的，都坦坦白白的作個眞實的介紹，好讓學生們有所據而取捨之。但這裏有着一個十分重要的問題，即是報導，必需絕對眞實。</p>
<p>「誤人子弟」吾觀如是，然否仍有待於餐者的指教。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] Chairman Chiang, noting that the review of the draft constitution has reached a stage and that a general assembly will be held on the 18th with the goal of completing the constitution soon, once again invited Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen, and others to dinner at 8 PM on the 17th. He inquired in detail about the progress of today's draft constitution review, and the meeting did not conclude until midnight.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The tenth meeting of the Presidium of the National Assembly was held at 4 PM on the 17th, chaired by He Chengjun. First, Hong Lanyou, Hu Shi, and others reported on the discussions of the general meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. Then, Chen Cheng reported on the progress of the fourth general meeting. Finally, it was decided that the General Assembly would be held at 9 AM on the 18th, with He Chengjun as chairman. Each review committee will report on the results of its reviews. The fifth general meeting was held at 3 PM to continue discussions on: (1) the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, the Control Yuan, and the issue of the power of consent; (2) the organization of the Examination Yuan and the power of consent of the Control Yuan; (3) the examination and assessment of public officials; (4) the power of consent and disciplinary powers of the Control Yuan; (5) the number of members of the Control Yuan; (6) the impeachment power of the Control Yuan over the President and Vice President of the Yuan; (7) changing the provincial and county system to a local system; (8) adding clauses on the autonomy system of the Mongolian and Tibetan regions; (9) adding clauses on the division of provinces and regions; (10) electoral regulations; (11) dividing the basic national policies into chapters; (12) adding a clause on marriage to the basic national policies; (13) stipulating that students must transcend party affiliations; (14) the definition of law; (15) the interpretation of the constitution; and (16) the establishment of procedures for the implementation of the constitution.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] Pu Ru and other Manchurian figures in Nanjing hosted a press conference at 3 PM on the 17th, appealing for attention and sympathy towards the Manchus. Pu first reported that in the 35 years since the founding of the Republic of China, Manchus scattered throughout the country have been subjected to shame and humiliation, and deeply feel discrimination and oppression. Their ancestral language is gradually disappearing, and their surnames and clans are often concealed. This unequal situation has become abnormal. Those who still live in tribes, propagating in the Northeast and Xinjiang according to their inherent customs and habits, are even more unable to share national rights and are treated as outcasts. He believes that since it is said to be a republic of five ethnicities, there should be no discrimination. The Manchu issue has been neglected for 35 years. It should not be neglected again in the constitution being drafted by the National Assembly. Just as the status of the Mongols, Tibetans, and even minority indigenous peoples can be enumerated in the constitution, the more than 30 million Manchus should also receive equal assistance. Since he could not attend the Joint Review Committee, he had to make this statement and express his views in writing. He will still raise the issue when the General Assembly reconvenes, hoping that this ethnic issue, which is so closely related to their own skin, can be reasonably resolved. Otherwise, this issue is like tinder waiting to be ignited, which will not benefit the country. Bi Tianmin, Tong Minchang of the Xibe tribe in Xinjiang, Cang Yunong of the Manchu population in Beijing, and Fu Zikai, and others then spoke, saying that the Qing Dynasty abdicated, it was not conquered. Since the founding of the Republic, they have endured humiliation and lived in unity, loyal to the country. In the past 35 years, there have been no incidents of rebellion. Puyi's puppet Manchukuo did not receive the support of the Manchus, but they still cannot enjoy the equal rights they deserve. As far as the National Assembly is concerned, there are representatives of industries and indigenous peoples, but there are no representatives of the Manchu people. In the process of drafting the constitution, few people have sympathy for the Manchus. They unanimously signed a request for support from all sectors for their simple request: "Striving for equality."</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The reorganization team of the Joint Review Committee held its first meeting at 10 AM on the 17th at the Presidium of the National Assembly. The conveners of the general meeting and the chief conveners of each review committee, Shao Lizi, Lin Bin, Kong Geng, Chen Qitian, Bai Chongxi, Jiang Yuntian, Wang Chonghui, Xu Hanzhuan, and over twenty others attended. Chairman Sun Ke presided, discussing the various cases referred by the general meeting. It took a long time, and the various opinions decided will be submitted to the general meeting to be held in the afternoon for discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 17th] The fourth meeting of the Joint Review Committee was held at 3:50 PM on the 17th in the first lounge of the National Assembly. News reporters were allowed to enter the venue to observe. One hundred and thirty-three representatives attended at the start of the meeting, with more arriving later, totaling one hundred and fifty-one. Chairman Chen Cheng announced the start of the meeting and then proceeded to the discussion according to the agenda. The first item was the organization of the National Assembly. Because the issue of ethnic minorities could not be resolved, it was sent to the reorganization team for discussion. The team revised Clause 26 as follows: "The National Assembly shall be organized by the following representatives: (1) Each county and city and its equivalent area shall elect one representative, but if the population reaches 500,000, one additional representative shall be elected for every additional 500,000 people. The definition of counties, cities, and equivalent areas shall be determined by law. (2) Mongolia shall elect four representatives from each league and one from each special banner. (3) Tibet shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (4) Various ethnic groups in border areas shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (5) Overseas Chinese citizens shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (6) Professional organizations shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law. (7) Women's organizations shall elect representatives, and the number shall be determined by law." After the proposal was made, only Liu Zongping suggested deleting the character "each" from "each special banner" in the third clause as a textual modification. The rest were passed without objection. The second item was the issue of National Assembly representatives not holding official positions concurrently. The reorganization opinion for Clause 28 was: "National Assembly representatives shall be re-elected every six years. The term of each National Assembly representative shall last until the date of the opening of the next National Assembly." The twelve characters "National Assembly representatives shall not hold official positions concurrently" added by the first review group were deleted, and the opinion of the reorganization team was passed. The third item was the powers of the Legislative Yuan. The reorganization team revised Clause 62 as follows: "The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body in the country, organized by legislators elected by the people, who exercise legislative power on behalf of the people." Someone suggested that "on behalf of the people" was unnecessary because the Legislative Yuan is an organ of governance, not an organ of political power, and cannot exercise governance on behalf of the people. Li Zhongxiang, Yin Shuxian, Chen Qitian, and others advocated maintaining the original proposal. When put to a vote, 108 people passed it by a majority, and only 33 people supported removing the four characters "on behalf of the people". The discussion then moved to Clause 63. The reorganization opinion only deleted the three characters "amnesty cases" from the original draft, and everyone passed it without objection. The fourth item was the number of legislators. The reorganization team revised Clause 65 as follows:</p>
<p>The total number of legislators shall not exceed 500,</p>
<p>Organized by the following legislators: (1) Those elected by each province and city, whose total number shall not exceed three-quarters of the total number of the entire Yuan. (2) Those elected by each league of Mongolia and Tibet. (3) Those elected by various ethnic groups in border areas. (4) Those elected by overseas Chinese citizens. (5) Those elected by professional organizations. The election of legislators, the distribution of the number of legislators, and the percentage of women that should be included shall be determined by law. Someone suggested that rigidly stipulating 500 people was unreasonable. Xinjiang representative Mai Huanxin and others suggested that the name of the Turkic people and their regions should be stipulated in the ethnic groups. There were still some opinions. The chairman immediately announced that it would be handed over to the reorganization team for further reorganization and then submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. The fifth item was the issue of countersigning the general promulgation of orders. The reorganization team intended to maintain the original draft, that is, Clause 38. Originally, there had been much debate during the third review, but no decision had been made. After the review by the reorganization team, it was believed that the original proposal should still be followed. Shi Shangkuan, the convener of the third group, stated that this case would be reserved for discussion at the General Assembly. The sixth item was the number of people required for reconsideration in the Legislative Yuan. The reorganization team's revised opinion for Clause 58 was: "The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the following provisions: (1) The Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan. Legislators have the right to question the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. (2) (3) Maintain the original draft." This clause was discussed for a long time, and several opinions were formed on the number of people required for reconsideration. One was a two-thirds attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. One was a three-quarters attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. One was a two-thirds attendance of legislators and a three-quarters passage of those present. At first, most people supported the first opinion. Representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party spoke. When the debate reached an impasse, Pan Gongzhan stood up and said: "A two-thirds attendance and a two-thirds passage is equivalent to four-ninths of all members, which is less than half, and cannot be established." As soon as these words were spoken, everyone applauded, expressing their support. After a vote, the second option was passed with the most support, that is, a three-quarters attendance of legislators and a two-thirds passage of those present. Secondly, Qing Gongzhan once said: "The executive power of the legislators should be the executive power of the Legislative Yuan because legislators must be within the Legislative Yuan to have executive power." The chairman announced that this principle would be handed over to the reorganization team for further discussion. The seventh item was the powers of the Judicial Yuan. The reorganization team's opinion for Clause 82 was revised to: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial body in the country, in charge of the adjudication of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits and the disciplinary action of public officials." There was much debate on this clause. The affiliation of the disciplinary power and the independence of the disciplinary power were discussed fiercely. Yu Jiaju and others all insisted on maintaining the original proposal. In the end, the reorganization team's opinion was passed with 77 votes in favor. The chairman announced that the unfinished issues would be discussed again at the fifth meeting on the 18th.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 17th] According to reports, those around Special Envoy Marshall indicated that the envoy would not leave China, at least during the National Assembly session. The envoy is very interested in the National Assembly's discussion of the draft constitution. He paid a visit to Chairman Chiang last Sunday and had a long talk on the issue of the constitution. Also, Ambassador Stuart has once again inquired about the CCP's attitude towards resuming peace talks in the future. CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan told him that the CCP's attitude has already been stated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 17th] Reliable sources said tonight that the government has temporarily abandoned sending peace envoys to Yan'an due to changes in the situation. Unconfirmed reports said that Chairman Chiang had informed Marshall and Stuart of this decision two days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Hu Shi Praises the Kuomintang: Their Ability to Express and Withdraw is Highly Commendable; Zhu Jiahua Hopes to Enact the Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A portion of the National Assembly representatives held a social banquet at the Lixingshe on the evening of the 16th, with many attendees from academic, educational, and cultural circles. This was the first gathering of social figures and political scientists, and they openly expressed their opinions on the issue of constitution-making at the meeting. Hu Shi, Zhu Jiahua, Zhou Gengsheng, and Fu Sinian were invited to speak.</p>
<p>Hu Shi said first that he considered this experiment in democratic politics in China to be a great success. Some people say that the National Assembly has suffered the pain of fatigue bombing, but in fact, with so many people, several times more than the parliaments of the United States and France, the order is no worse than that of the parliaments of various countries. Before 1917 in the United States, there was a rule in the Senate's rules of procedure that discussions could not be terminated, which was true fatigue bombing. Hu Shi expressed his respect for the Kuomintang, saying that it is commendable that a party that has been in power for 20 years can fully demonstrate both the spirit of freedom and the effectiveness of discipline. Especially in the changes of the last two days, the ability of the Kuomintang to express and withdraw is even more commendable than discipline.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua said that constitution-making is a major plan for the century, but it must take into account the current political environment. The Political Consultative Conference draft constitution was formulated through long-term discussions by all parties, summarizing the opinions of all parties, and has its own historical value. He hopes that all parties will promote it and enable the General Assembly to successfully complete this historic task. The spirit of enhancing the basic rights of the people should be respected.</p>
<p>Zhou Gengsheng advocated including the article on complying with the United Nations Charter in the basic national policies according to the original draft. He said that China is one of the four major signatory countries of the United Nations Charter. China should have the determination to consolidate the United Nations organization and implement the United Nations Charter to show that China will fulfill its responsibility for world peace.</p>
<p>Finally, Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun expressed their opinions on education and border issues, respectively. Today happened to be the eve of Hu Shi's birthday, and the guests and hosts expressed their congratulations.</p>

They jointly agreed on:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding long-distance telephone calls: A. The method of charging 30% less for evening calls in the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) area will be extended to all important locations across the country. B. Ordinary telephone stations will designate times and provide the same preferential treatment as item A. C. The time for evening calls and news agency daytime calls will be negotiated separately.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding telegrams: A. If the license fee is not paid in cash, it will be guaranteed by a money shop or bank. B. Ordinary news telegrams will be sent in advance. C. The Ministry of Communications will be requested to study simplified code telegrams in conjunction with the Central Propaganda Department for use by newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding airmail: Various air transport locations may use the book and small package method for mailing, but it still needs to be requested.</p>
<p>In addition, the airmail rate for newspapers between Nanjing and Shanghai is currently 3,120 yuan per kilogram, which will be reduced to 1,290 yuan per kilogram according to the book and small package method. In addition, Beijing-Hankou is 1,910 yuan, Beijing-Peiping is 3,670 yuan, and Beijing-Chongqing is 4,200 yuan, with air freight rates added.</p>
<p>The representatives also raised two points of hope: (1) A request to revise the telephone fee method, and temporarily pay at 50% of the current price before the new method is announced. (2) A request to revise the telegraph fee method, and temporarily pay at the original price before the new method is announced.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 17th] As I, the reporter, pen this utterly tragic and unbelievable dispatch, I am filled with immense grief and call upon the nation to pay serious attention to this reality. For the Communist army is inflicting primitive and inhumane cruelty upon the people, creating a red terror that is starkly revealed in the Chongli massacre. Thousands of anti-Japanese Communist soldiers launched a massive attack on Chongli County, 50 kilometers from Zhangyuan. The defending troops of Shi Wangshan's unit and the civilians did their utmost to defend the city, but were ultimately overwhelmed due to the disparity in numbers, sacrificing themselves entirely. After the Communist army carried out planned killings and destruction, the regular army arrived and they fled in haste. On the 14th, the local authorities invited me and a group of 15 other reporters stationed in Zhangjiakou to travel by car to Chongli to observe the post-robbery scene. The number of people slaughtered by the Communist army is still impossible to tally, but of the original population of over 2,800 in the county town, less than half remain. Over 400 corpses have already been collected. I personally witnessed over 200 corpses piled up in one area of the Catholic Church courtyard, a gruesome mess of blood and flesh, with bodies and heads separated, all frozen stiff. It is said that before the Communist army executed the people, they first stripped them of their clothes. The methods of killing were a collection of the best of ancient and modern techniques, including nailing limbs to trees and disemboweling people, gutting them, tying several people together and stoning them to death, cutting off breasts and genitals, gouging out anuses, severing arms and legs, and most commonly, burning the genitals with fire and stabbing them to death with bayonets. Father Xu of the Catholic Church was crushed to death by rocks. Two foreign priests were attacked. Some civilians escaped from burning houses, but were thrown back in to be burned alive. Furthermore, over 200 captured soldiers and civilians were bound with lead wire and mowed down with machine guns. The狰狞 怪狀(zheng ning guai zhuang) facial expressions of the corpses showed the painful struggles before their deaths. Every household suffered casualties. The Zheng family had five members killed. Based on age, there were old men over 70 years old, and four or five recorded instances of war. As for occupations, there were Catholic personnel, priests, soldiers, farmers, workers, merchants, and women. The Xizi Catholic Church, with over a hundred years of history and magnificent scale, was the center of the Northwestern Diocese. The local people defended it for twelve hours, but were ultimately burned to death with the church. Only the orphanage remains intact, spared because the one hundred and eighty orphans knelt and begged for mercy. I witnessed many of the civilians who escaped returning with deranged nerves, alternating between crying and laughing, staggering through the streets, searching for the corpses of their family members. The foreign nuns cried at the sight of everyone. An eight-year-old child knelt before me and begged me to leave more soldiers to save them, their words deeply moving. The people's coal, food, and clothing were either taken away or destroyed. They are now only able to fill their bellies with horse corpses. The authorities have already begun emergency relief efforts. What crime have the people committed to suffer such abuse? We, on behalf of the dead, accuse this group of brutal and murderous cutthroats of filling the fields with corpses and appeal to the nation to help these survivors, demand that the government punish the perpetrators, and hope that Chinese and foreign reporters will come to witness this human tragedy.</p>

It is reported that the issues that remain to be resolved by both sides include: (1) the settlement of occupation army expenses, which were originally set at 60 million Vietnamese dong per month. However, the two sides have different opinions regarding the duration. Our side believes that it should be counted from the date of the handover of defense, while the French side argues that it should be paid according to the reduction in personnel since our army began to withdraw in March of this year. As for the food rice for the motorcades, the French side also believes that it is included in the military expenses, while our side believes that the devaluation of Vietnamese dong means that the expenses of the garrison are actually more than this, and proposes that it be calculated separately. (2) The evaluation of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the issue of compensation for our losses in Vietnam. Regarding the former, the main issue is technical, namely the agreement on the depreciation standard of the railway and the current degree of damage. In the past few days, when the two sides contacted each other to resume negotiations, Muhe had already exchanged views in principle with our Ministry of Communications. Our side is expected to propose an evaluation plan and figures on the 20th. As for compensation, our side has also made a decision in principle on whether to use currency or factory equipment left by the Japanese, and may propose it together with the former case. (3) The cooperation on the Vietnamese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the establishment of a free port in Haiphong. The method of cooperation for the former remains to be discussed. For the latter, in order to facilitate transportation and simplify management, our side believes that it is necessary to delineate a free zone and establish a dedicated wharf. The French side, on the other hand, argues that the wharf should be public and that there is no need to set up a dedicated wharf separately. Our side's specific plan will also be proposed after the resumption of negotiations. According to the speculation of a certain authoritative person, it is hoped that the first two items and the first half of the third item can be successfully negotiated and resolved, while the free zone and dedicated wharf in Haiphong may still need to be resolved after an actual on-site survey.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] The overseas Chinese here believe that the situation in northern Vietnam has not yet become clear and that conflicts may continue to occur in Hanoi and other places at any time. In order to establish a neutral zone for overseas Chinese as soon as possible, after discussions among 32 overseas Chinese organizations in the city, it was decided to send overseas Chinese leaders Yang Jianquan and Yan Renfu to Nanjing to report to the central government on the suffering of the overseas Chinese in the Haiphong-Lang Son conflict and to give their opinions on the establishment of a neutral zone. Yang Yan is scheduled to fly to Kunming and then to Nanjing on the 17th.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] It is widely rumored here that road traffic between Lang Son and Tianyan has been cut off by Vietnamese troops, but this has not yet been confirmed. The Tianyan area is located near Guangdong Province, where French troops had previously been stationed for several months. On the other hand, the situation in Nghệ An, which was originally very tense, has recently eased slightly after the French Commissioner for Tonkin negotiated with the government authorities of Duy Tan and requested protection for European expatriates in the city.</p>

<p>[Our Central Dispatch] After UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia resigned, Major General Lowell W. Rooks was appointed as his successor. This has been unanimously approved by the UNRRA authorities in Washington and is scheduled to officially take office as UNRRA Director-General on New Year's Day. General Rooks is the first UNRRA Director-General to have visited China to inspect UNRRA's work in China. Rooks represented former Director-General LaGuardia in China in May and June of this year to inspect and adjust the work of the UNRRA China Office. He spent two weeks inspecting five provinces in China, and then took the opportunity to visit Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou and Hankou, where the Yellow River project was underway. In Nanjing, Rooks met with President Chiang and Marshal Marshall. General Rooks made great contributions during the war. After returning to the United States from Germany in November 1945, he was appointed Executive Director of UNRRA. He participated in World War I and was in charge of US Army training during World War II. In June 1942, he went to England as Chief of Staff of the Second Army and participated in the landing battle of Oran (November 8, 1942). He was then appointed Assistant Chief of Staff of the Allied Headquarters on December 8, 1942, and soon promoted to Chief of Staff Representative, serving under Marshal Eisenhower. He was then transferred to the 19th Army Command in the European Theater. After the end of the European War, he was sent to Germany to take on important positions and returned to the United States in August 1945. During the war, he was awarded the Oak Leaf Cluster, the Silver Star Medal, the Special Medal, the Bronze Star Medal, and medals from the British and French governments. The General was born in Washington and joined the army in 1917. When he was Executive Director of UNRRA, he was in charge of finance and administration. His succession as UNRRA Director-General this time is bound to make a great contribution.</p>

<p>[Our Newsletter] The Fujian-Xiamen Highway, which is 200 miles long, was an important transportation artery in Fujian Province before the war. It was completely destroyed in 1938. None of the 300 bridges along the highway were intact. Recently, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Ministry of Communications, and the Fujian Provincial Government have jointly started reconstruction work, with a budget of 300 million yuan. Half of the funds were allocated by the Ministry of Communications, and the UNRRA supplied the labor rations and road construction materials. Last week, UNRRA ships arrived in Fujian, carrying 750 tons of road construction materials and many engineers and technicians. The roadbed has now been repaired, and the remaining work is being accelerated. According to UNRRA foreign engineer Gu Lasi, the population is dense along the highway line, and the plague in southern Fujian this year is unprecedented. At present, malaria is prevalent, and nearly half of the residents are infected. However, inland transportation is blocked, and external medical relief is extremely difficult. The restoration of highway traffic is urgently needed.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, Mao Shuqing, 17th Exclusive] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations held a Christmas banquet at the Yangcheng Restaurant here tonight to entertain people from all walks of life. The invited guests included secretaries of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, journalists, Chinese officials, and prominent members of the American Chinese community, such as General He Yingqin and Dr. Dong XianGuang, more than two hundred people in total. During the banquet, General He Yingqin told reporters: "I am one of the loyal overseas readers of the Shen Bao. Please convey my regards to the colleagues at your newspaper." He expressed great interest in winter hunting and praised the perfection of the American hunting management system. A week ago, He Yingqin, accompanied by Chinese Air Force General Mao Bangchu, went to Virginia for a hunting trip, staying for several days and hunting a male deer. He said: "Only one week of the year is allowed to hunt male deer in the forest, and female deer are not allowed to be hunted. The authorities keep statistics on all the pheasants, bustards, and eagles that are hunted. When the prescribed limit is exceeded, the entire forest is closed. Unless you go to the forest and hunt in person, you cannot know the details of the hunting rules. I would very much like to write an article for the Shen Bao, introducing the social conditions in the United States." The reporter replied that the Shen Bao would be happy to publish General He's work.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, London, 16th] Officials here expressed doubt about the possibility of launching a "International Monetary Fund Promotion Week" as reported by Washington. It is also said that there are many difficulties in how to stipulate the exchange rates of currencies between the member countries of the International Monetary Fund. In addition, the attitude of the Republican Party, the majority party in the US Congress, is another difficulty. The President of the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development resigned last week due to increasing difficulties in the future.</p>
<p>Loan to China Issue</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] London financial figures believe that it is "too early" or directly calls on China to not contribute its full allocation to the Bretton Woods institutions, regarding the news from New York that the US government will oppose the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development issuing any credit loans to China. Currently, China is the third largest contributing country in the fund, only decided on by the US and the UK, with an allocation of US$600 million. It is understood that China has already contributed Chinese currency equal to US$20 million. According to a New York report: "Senior authoritative figures" believe that a public speech by a US State Department official explains that allowing China to use its funds by the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the Fund should not be considered a risky move. Figures in New York and London once believed that the situation in China may prevent China from enjoying all the rights of a member country of the International Monetary Fund at some point. However, financial figures in London point out: Whether China is considered a risky target of the Fund should be decided by the staff of the Fund, not solely by the United States. The view that China will not be able to obtain credit loans from the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also surprised figures in New York. The report also stated: Because 80 percent of China's expenditures are used for military purposes, the currency fund's credit may automatically prevent China from requesting loans from the fund to make up for its balance of payments. The report continued: The directors of the Monetary Fund recently admitted the US government's interpretation of this article, stating that using the currency fund's funds to finance extensive military system plans should be prohibited. Whether the aforementioned US policy's explanation is　　　　　, it still needs to be proven by the final decision of whether the United States will allow an Export-Import Bank US$500 million loan to China.</p>

It is said that Huang Jingchang was a student in Germany and had worked in the National Resources Commission and other agencies.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Dula Leek, the first Siamese Ambassador to China, and his party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:40 p.m. on the 17th. Dula said that his mission to China was to eliminate misunderstandings between China and Siam and to promote diplomatic relations between the two countries. He also said that he was of purely Chinese descent and would strive to complete this important task. He told reporters at the hotel: Unfortunate incidents between overseas Chinese and Siamese in Siam have recently been decreasing, and even if they occur, they are not as serious as reported outside. This time, the Thai ambassador will try to resolve misunderstandings as much as possible. Regarding the establishment of consulates in China, I will recommend to the government that consulates be established in Shantou, Haikou, Shanghai, and Nanjing. The consulate general will be established in Nanjing. Regarding the prospects for Sino-Siamese trade, Dula said: "Siam's current imports and exports are still restricted by the Anglo-Siamese Agreement. Once exports recover in the future, Siamese rice, tin, and rubber can all be shipped to China." He continued: "The restrictions on overseas Chinese education in Siam are only in primary schools because the government stipulates that primary schools are run by the government." When asked about the truth of reports that the Siamese government restricts overseas Chinese schools and forces overseas Chinese schools to teach Siamese, Dula replied: "I am afraid it is a misunderstanding caused by the Siamese government's desire to inspect textbooks, which takes time to translate between Chinese and Siamese."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Regarding the rumor that a synthetic gasoline plant is listed among the Japanese reparations factories and may be dismantled and relocated to Taiwan, the National Resources Commission believes that if the synthetic gasoline plant is converted into a fertilizer manufacturing plant, it will not require much funding. When Qian Changzhao recently answered an inquiry from a Central News Agency reporter, he said: The dispute at the US headquarters in Tokyo is to preserve Japanese fertilizer plants to prevent them from being dismantled, so as not to affect Japanese food supply. It is said that a part of the synthetic gasoline plant has been converted into a fertilizer plant by the US headquarters awarding Japan. Now it is learned that a synthetic gasoline plant has been privately converted into a fertilizer plant by the Japanese, but it has not yet been completed. It is now planned to negotiate to include the plant in the scope of reparations.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Fuzimiao and Daxiao Shibatang area of Nanjing, located on the banks of the Qinhuai River, has long been a gathering place for singers and prostitutes due to the legacy of the Six Dynasties' extravagance. Although the police bureau has repeatedly cracked down on it, the malpractices have become greater and greater. There are even cases of criminals hiding for fear of being caught and punished. Now, in order to rectify public morals and facilitate the maintenance of public security, the police bureau of the district has drafted a "Preliminary Proposal for the Restoration of Public Prostitution" and submitted it to the department for review and decision. The steps and measures in the "Preliminary Proposal" are recorded as follows: (A) Steps: (1) Investigation and registration (according to the bureau's investigation, there are 400 private prostitutes in the Southern District), (2) Issuance of business licenses, (3) Delineation of business areas -- concentrated in the Daxiao Shibatang area, (4) Regulations on the identification of brothel households, (5) Prohibition of singers from staying overnight with customers; (6) Establishment of women's factories to accommodate prostitutes who change careers or unemployed women. (B) Measures: (1) Hygiene inspection issues -- designated doctors will be required to conduct mandatory inspections twice a month, and clients will also be inspected to prevent venereal diseases, (2) Prostitute identification issues -- stipulate uniforms and wear badges; (3) Prostitute protection issues -- those who wish to be of good character, are beaten by madams, are several months pregnant, or have not been full three months after childbirth will be given legal protection. The distribution of business income between prostitutes and madams will also be legally stipulated to avoid damage to the interests of prostitutes, (4) Public security and public morals issues -- clients must purchase tickets at the price to prevent criminals and deserters from mixing in the incident; (5) Tax issues -- the tax amount standards are stipulated according to the prostitute level and business conditions. 40% is remitted to the municipal government, and 60% is for police expenses.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to informal statistics, there are about 15,000 secret prostitutes in Nanjing, 400 of whom have been identified in the Southern District, and 2,211 singers have been registered. The authorities, in view of the fact that nine out of ten singers also engage in prostitution, are planning to increase their remuneration in order to stabilize their lives.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Washington Star stated in an editorial today: The Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from Northeast China and its transport back to the Kremlin is a strategic gambit, but it will inevitably provoke resentment from the United States and other countries. The editorial stated: This move will not be considered dignified, and it is believed that the Soviet Union, when looting the Northeast, must have had its long-term strategic goals in mind. The purpose of the Soviet Union's plan to seize spoils of war is to permanently plunge China into a state of weakness and difficulty, and it is by no means to support the Soviet economy.</p>

<h3 id="e40">The Achievements of the United Nations General Assembly <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly closed on the 16th. During the past 54 days of meetings, many important issues were discussed. Although the representatives of various countries argued fiercely, and the waves of success lake rose and fell, the atmosphere was generally harmonious, and the achievements of the meeting far exceeded those of any international conference since the end of World War II. British Foreign Secretary Bevin said: "The sun of peace is rising." Assembly President Spaak said in his closing remarks: "When you return to your countries, you will be able to convey a message full of confidence and hope to your governments and people." Gu Weijun, the chief representative of our country, also said: "All resolutions are very important, very progressive, and contain a spirit of freedom. They will surely promote unprecedented cooperation and bring great light to the future happiness of mankind."</p>
<p>To achieve world peace, we must first prevent the arms race among countries that poses the greatest threat to peace. The greatest achievement of this United Nations General Assembly is undoubtedly the passage of the resolution on universal disarmament. This proposal was formally put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on October 29th, and the United States immediately expressed its agreement and further proposed the establishment of a regulatory agency. Finally, a principle was adopted to hand over the discussion of the method to the Security Council. In principle, disarmament includes any weapons of any country, and the regulatory agency is completely independent and not subject to the restrictions of the veto power. This means that the Soviet Union does not insist on retaining the veto power, is willing to report and reduce domestic and foreign troops, and the United States can hand over the secrets of the atomic bomb for international co-management. This is the greatest expression of mutual concessions between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the Security Council can come up with appropriate measures and this principle can be implemented, the crisis of a third world war seems to be fundamentally eliminated.</p>
<p>The second greatest achievement of the United Nations General Assembly is that a solution has been found to the Spanish question. In the past, the Franco regime in Spain was opposed by many countries in the world, and the Soviet Union's criticism was particularly fierce, but Britain strongly supported it. The main reasons: (1) The commercial relationship between Britain and Spain accounts for a large number of British exports. (2) As Soviet power spread westward, Britain wanted to use the Franco regime to strengthen its defense against the Soviet Union. (3) International intervention may re-ignite the Spanish civil war and cause the European situation to become chaotic again. Due to the above reasons, Britain opposed any actions to sanction the Spanish government, and the United States was unwilling to take active action against the Spanish government due to its confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, at this United Nations General Assembly, both Britain and the United States made concessions and passed a resolution to recall Spanish envoys. Although the methods of economic severance and military sanctions were not passed, recalling envoys is at least a manifestation of justice. Moreover, military sanctions will inevitably arouse the resentment of the majority of the Spanish people, and economic severance will also cut off the livelihood of the Spanish people, which may not be the most appropriate method at present.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two important issues that have not been satisfactorily resolved. The first is to limit the veto power of the five powers, and the second is the trusteeship plan for the colonies of former enemy countries. The veto power of the five powers is enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and the Soviet Union believes that it is the foundation for the establishment of the United Nations, opposing any proposals to abolish or restrict it. Many small countries advocate abolishing it, and the United States and Britain agree to restrict it, but no concrete agreement has been reached. However, arbitrarily amending the United Nations Charter can easily shake the dignity of the Charter itself and increase Soviet fear, and the fact that the disarmament resolution is not subject to the restrictions of the veto power already shows the Soviet Union's concession on this issue.</p>
<p>Regarding the colonial trusteeship issue, many countries have advocated that the United Nations Trusteeship Committee directly handle it, but the United States and Britain are unwilling to fully accept it. However, regarding the Pacific islands, US President Truman did not adopt the requests of the Department of the Army and Navy to annex them, but only hoped that the United Nations Trusteeship Committee would entrust the United States with sole trusteeship, which still shows considerable respect for the United Nations organization. As for the proposal by South African Prime Minister Smuts to ask the United Nations General Assembly to allow the annexation of South West Africa, it has been rejected by the majority of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>In summary, the achievements of this United Nations General Assembly are already quite considerable. At the same time, the harmonious atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly is more concretely manifested in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The most complex issues of the five defeated countries, such as the co-management of Trieste, the opening of the Danube River, and the reparations of the defeated countries, have all been agreed upon, and the peace with Germany has already begun to be discussed. The next Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference will not be difficult to solve completely. According to recent news reports from various countries, the transformation of Soviet policy is unanimously praised as the main reason for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. What is particularly gratifying is that the Chinese delegation adopted an impartial attitude in this United Nations General Assembly, taking care of the interests of all parties, striving to seek compromises, and seeking to solve practical problems, which has won the praise of various countries and invisibly improved China's international status. The Chinese delegation has also made a considerable contribution to the achievements of this United Nations General Assembly.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] Mount Lu has been frequently hit by wind and snow in recent days, and the tidal surge has expanded. The collapse of riverbanks in Nansha is becoming increasingly serious. Toupeng Town was suddenly attacked by the waves the other day, and most of it has sunk into the river's heart. People did not have time to evacuate, resulting in heavy losses.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] Nansha in the lower reaches of the Qiantang River, surrounded by rivers on the east, west, and north sides, is eroding the banks. Major towns such as Toupeng, Xinwan, and Hengcha will soon be submerged. The Nansha Water Conservancy Committee plans to build a dam, requiring 1.1 billion yuan and 362 tons of flour. It is proposed to ask the Executive Yuan's Zhejiang Office to provide two-fourths, the central government and the province to provide one-fourth, and the rest to be raised locally through beneficiary fees of 2,000 or 3,000 yuan per mu.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou] Dong Xiujia, who successively held the pseudo-positions of Director of the Construction Department of the pseudo-Jiangsu Province, Deputy Director of the Tax Bureau of the pseudo-Ministry of Finance, and Director-General of the pseudo-Shanghai Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, planned the enemy's finances, assisted the enemy in opening up financial resources, and plundered the people's wealth during his tenure in the pseudo-positions. At the time, he had the nickname "General Plunderer," which shows one aspect of his crimes. The people hated him deeply. Later, he followed Gao Guanwu to Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, serving in pseudo-positions until the victory, when he disappeared. The Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate has started an investigation in accordance with the law based on reports from the public.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Yan Bailiang, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, served as a specialist in land registration in Jiaxing and Wuxing, Zhejiang before the war. Because he compiled many volumes of maps of the area along the Zhejiang River, Yan Bailiang actually offered all the maps to the Japanese invaders after the August 13th Incident, willingly betraying the country and receiving generous rewards. In the 28th year, he used the pseudonym Yichang to found the pseudo-China Commercial Center in Shanghai, advocating a policy of enslavement. In the 29th year, he transferred to the pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Secretary of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, committing many evils during his tenure in various pseudo-positions. Later, he was reported to the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, and after repeated detentions, the prosecutor found that the crimes were true and filed six lawsuits on the 17th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Zhu Han, the pseudo-county magistrate of Taixing, Subei, and Li Song, the pseudo-secretary, were tried and sentenced by the Jiangsu Higher Court on the 17th.

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Changshu] Since the attack on Guli Town by bandits, the security situation in the rural areas here has become unstable again. Recently, scattered bandits have become increasingly active. In view of this, the military, government, health, and police agencies held a security conference at the headquarters of the garrison brigade on the 16th to discuss steps for a large-scale suppression of banditry and plan the direction of the operation. The security brigade headquarters has transferred a portion of its officers and soldiers stationed in the Shazhou area back to the city to consolidate defenses and concentrate mobile forces. They will depart to various areas in the next few days to conduct patrols and sweeps in order to wipe out the bandits in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] Lieutenant General Xu Yanmou, Director of the Research Institute of the Army University, arrived in Suzhou today to participate in a joint public banquet held by five military agencies stationed in Suzhou, including the Youth Army Artillery Regiment, the Automobile Training Regiment, and the Regiment Management District Command. The invitees included local military and government leaders, party and regiment representatives, and members of the press, totaling more than 60 people. Xu was one of the most eye-catching guests. All of the generals above the rank of colonel at the banquet were his students. The reporter of this newspaper, with the introduction of Major General Cao Yongxiang, had a very pleasant conversation with this famous strategist. At the end of the banquet, Xu stood up and gave a speech amid applause from the entire audience, the gist of which was that the weak civilian customs of Jiangnan would not be enough to adapt to today's world competition. Suzhou is the leading county in Jiangnan and should take the lead in changing the weak civilian customs. Therefore, he hoped that the military agencies stationed in Suzhou would establish close ties with the local administrative agencies and incorporate the organizational spirit of the army into the civilian population in order to eliminate the need for soft habits and cultivate a strong will, which would guarantee local security on a small scale and defend the country against insults on a large scale. According to reports, Xu will take a short rest in Suzhou and then return to his hometown of Kunshan before returning to Nanjing in a few days.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] The Hangzhou City Council held its third general meeting on the 16th and listened to reports from various departments of the municipal government. Because Hangzhou's food supply is only enough for two months, councilors expressed great concern about how to solve the spring famine. The person in charge said that based on past experience, they have already planned to prevent it. A councilor proposed that in order to implement gender equality, women should also be required to serve in the military and perform labor service.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou] Hangzhou City Councilor Qian Jingxi submitted two proposals to the City Council on the 16th. One was to lift the dance ban, on the grounds that Hangzhou is an international garden city and must have dance hall facilities. Past public opinion criticisms were nothing more than management technical issues, which can be improved. After the dance ban is lifted, the city can prosper, and the city's tax revenue can also be increased. The second was to establish public prostitution, on the grounds that the government cannot provide a way out for private prostitutes and must consider their survival. Arresting and fining them only increases disturbances and does not help in practice. Therefore, the establishment of public prostitution can facilitate management, and sexually transmitted diseases that endanger national health can often be reduced.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 17th] The provincial government has ordered that the work of collecting in-kind taxes in this county must be completed by December 15th and all payments must be submitted. The deadline has already passed. The reporter of this newspaper visited Chen Chun, the deputy director of the County Land Tax Office, on the 17th to inquire about the situation.

Fortunately, the provincial government has issued an order to extend the deadline by half a month. However, overdue penalties will be added during the extended period, and the major office will intensify its efforts to collect taxes in order to meet the needs of all parties.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th] The Zhejiang Chairman arrived in Huangyan on the 13th, went to Taizhou at 9:00 p.m., returned to Haimen from Taizhou on the night of the 15th, reached Xiaoxiong via Taozhu on the 16th, and stayed in Jiantiao on the 17th. He will arrive in Sanmen on the 18th. He is inspecting the political situation along the way, diligently seeking out the people's plight, and providing guidance and encouragement to his subordinates at any time. When he was 30 li away from Wenzhou in Haimen, the ship he was on was damaged and drifted for one night, experiencing all kinds of dangers. Fortunately, he encountered the Xinruian, a sea liner, the next day, and was towed back to Wenzhou, which relieved the danger. However, he still persevered and continued his difficult journey to inspect the counties of Wen and Tai. He will return to Hangzhou at the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Another One Using High-Interest Loans as Bait: Bath Attendant Swindles 80 Million <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Wuxi] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, prices were slightly more balanced, so the trend of hoarding greatly decreased. Therefore, women and ordinary merchants with some savings all rose up to "join societies" and "split exchange," and there was a trend of "bidding societies." However, these are all disguised high-interest loans, so those who are overwhelmed by this oppression and cannot make ends meet, resulting in bankruptcy or escape, are heard of every day. Dai Chunshan, a bath attendant leader at the Sanquan Pool Bathhouse outside Ximen, took the opportunity of bidding societies and splitting exchanges to lure more than 100 women, old maids, and small bosses, totaling more than 80 million yuan, and absconded with the money. This is truly shocking.</p>
<p>Limping Cart Puller</p>
<p>Chunshan is from Gaoyou, 31 years old this year. He joined the military in his early years and was shot in the left leg during the war. After treatment, he became lame and walked abnormally. After retiring from the army, he changed his career. He first rubbed backs in a bathhouse in Zhenjiang and then opened a bathhouse in Yixing. Later, because the business was not good, he came to Wuxi from northern Jiangsu with his wife, Aju, last summer and lived in the workshop of the Jinji Silk Factory in Youche Lane outside Ximen. At that time, life was very difficult. Dai went out to pull a cart, and Aju also sold sesame cakes and fried dough sticks to maintain the family's livelihood. Later, because his lame leg made it difficult for him to walk, he changed his career to become a cobbler.</p>
<p>Excellent Credit</p>
<p>Until the 23rd day of the first month of this year, he was introduced to the Sanquan Bathhouse near Dexin Bridge to rub backs. Because he was diligent and thrifty, he gained the trust of the boss. In April, because his income was not enough for household expenses, he "invited societies" from neighbors and colleagues. Because his character was good and his credit was excellent, Dai further split small amounts of money from nearby women, and his interest rate was higher than the market rate. In order to keep his word, he sent the interest on time. In fact, he pulled from east to west, all the money was split from others. However, women generally stored their private savings with him because they coveted his interest. Later, his methods became more and more flexible, specializing in doing "head societies," and then "bidding societies" at high interest rates. Everyone's purpose was to seek profit, and they all put the society money they had won with Dai.</p>
<p>Chanting Buddha and Buying Property</p>
<p>In July of this year, epidemics were prevalent in various places, and Zhan also contributed 600,000 yuan to worship the Buddha for one day, which verified the Buddha's appearance. Residents there became more and more convinced and were willing to exchange gold jewelry and give the money to Chunshan. By this time, there were more than 50 debtors. Once one enters this area, one will hear his name. In August, in order to avoid being detected of his hypocrisy, he secretly bought a house there for 2.25 million. At the same time, all the furniture in the room was newly purchased. On September 13th, he moved all his family members in, bought new clothes, added new decorations, held banquets, and bought gold jewelry, just like a wealthy merchant, being arrogant and uninhibited. Since Dai obtained the house, he has been unable to support the interest for the debtors and has been in arrears from time to time, but the debtors do not suspect anything else. A peanut vendor invested 8 million yuan, the boss of the Sanquan Pool more than 10 million yuan, an old woman, Shao Zhou, more than 7 million yuan, and his colleagues more than 10 million yuan, all of which were loaned to Dai. At this time, Dai was in debt for more than 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Escaping in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>At the end of September, Dai's brother and brother-in-law suddenly came to Wuxi from northern Jiangsu by boat and secretly transported out gold jewelry and valuable clothes, disguised as transporting peanuts and other things. At the beginning of this month, Chunshan was already determined to abscond, so he tried his best to split money from various households and pledged the house order for 1 million yuan. On the 14th, he secretly arranged for his wife and daughter to escape. During the day, he also sold 2.5 dou of rice stored at home to others. At about 1:00 a.m. that night, Dai finished his work at the Sanquan Pool and disappeared without a trace. On the 15th, more than 20 cases of society deadlines and split exchange deadlines were due. The parties went to his home to look for him and saw that the door was locked from the inside. They realized that he had absconded. After investigation, the total amount of money defrauded was more than 80 million yuan.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Wuxing] The case of Zhenkang Silk Shop in this city, which issued bad checks and defrauded more than 200 million yuan, suddenly declared bankruptcy, has been reported in this newspaper. The 46 shops that were defrauded believe that the shop's fraudulent remittances and sudden closure, and the person in charge avoiding and hiding, are undoubtedly fraud and obtaining property. They organized a creditors' group on the 14th and elected Tan Qinbu, Qian Xiangrong, Lu Zhongyan, Zhang Caixin, Yang Luming, and Pan Gantang as representatives. They first published a warning in the newspaper, setting a deadline of seven days to handle the matter clearly. If it is ignored after the deadline, they will file a lawsuit with the Wuxing Court and request a wanted order. The relevant authorities also attach great importance to this case.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's dispatch from Yangzhou] Since the National Army successively recovered various counties in northern Jiangsu, tens of thousands of refugees from the sixteen counties affiliated to Yangzhou have mostly been sent back by the Executive Yuan's Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch or have returned to their hometowns at their own expense. Among them, only the refugees from Yancheng, Funing, and Lianshui counties have not been able to return because their hometowns are still in war. Since they fled to Yangzhou in January of this year, each person has only been given one and a half bags of relief flour by the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch, with nothing else. Now that the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, they have no food or clothing and cannot bear the hunger and cold. Therefore, a thousand refugees from Lian, Yan, and Fu counties automatically gathered a few days ago and went to the Yangzhou District Working Team of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to petition. Representatives Tian Liting, Gu Tongsan, and Zhang Xiangfu directly presented their grievances to Team Leader Chen, and submitted three requests, asking them to forward them to the branch: (1) Relief supplies in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang should be treated equally, (2) An additional three bags of flour and soybean flour should be issued, and (3) An additional three sets of cotton clothing should be issued. Later, Team Leader Chen telegraphed the details to the branch for review. On the 16th, he received a reply, stating that the requests made by the Yangzhou refugees could be accepted. The refugees from Yan, Fu, and Lian counties were overjoyed when they heard the news.</p>

<p>Attention to Those Withdrawing Money from Banks</p>
<p>I am the accountant in a rice store in Jinze Town, Qingpu. Although it is a small-capital rice store, the amount of cash flowing in and out every day is quite large, especially in the morning when farmers sell their rice. Our purpose of operating is to transport the rice to Shanghai for sale, so all the cash is brought down from Shanghai, or withdrawn from banks and money shops. A few days ago, an employee of our store collected 2 million legal currency from a Shanghai grain firm, with four bundles of 500,000 each. Because the banknotes were very tightly packed, and there was a bank seal affixed to the hemp thread, relying on the bank's reputation and due to time constraints, they were not counted. The employee immediately left Shanghai and returned home, handing the banknotes over to me. Because I had seen a report in a newspaper about a certain iron factory frequently experiencing shortages in full bundles of banknotes, I paid special attention and counted them one by one. Unexpectedly, the same thing happened: each bundle was short 10,000 yuan (with ten 500-yuan notes making up 10,000 yuan), for a total shortage of 40,000 yuan. For small businesses like ours, it's almost like working as a solo merchant, painstakingly transporting rice to Shanghai, really hoping to earn a few hard-earned coins. Who knew that returning home would bring such great disappointment? This is so pitiful for small businesses. Banks are the hub of social finance, yet even they have such malpractices. What are small businesses to do? (Zhao Xinyong, Jinze Town, Qingpu)</p>
<p>Evil Wind of Rotating Credit Associations (Biao Hui) Drags Down Small Shops</p>
<p>We are a group of small merchants harmed by "hui" (rotating credit associations). Our small shop, which could barely make a living, is now about to close down!</p>
<p>The origin of "hui" is that people with a little face and some influence inherit the bad habits of the enemy-puppet period, using a kind of latent power to invite participation. We, who are timid and afraid of trouble, cannot escape. This matter of gaining profit without capital has aroused the approval of many people, and we can't even keep up with the invitations to join hui. 100,000, 300,000, 500,000, up to 1 million, emerge one after another. For example, in a hui composed of 20 people, with 500,000 per person, the head of the hui can get 10 million. Bidding is held once or twice a month, and those who do not win the bid pay their dues monthly. But we have more than one "hui", sometimes as many as forty or fifty. Our monthly business income is only three to four million, and we still have to cover capital and expenses, while monthly hui payments exceed two to three times that amount. Where does this uncovered money come from? Borrow from the bank? We small businessmen don't overdraw. Request government relief? How easy is that? Should we steal or rob? Never, we can't do that forever. How to solve this difficult problem? We can only appeal to the government authorities and social elites to find a way to maintain and resolve our livelihoods, to avoid becoming beggars, and to avoid being surrounded and destroyed by evil forces.

<p>Qinghu Highway Urgently Needs Improvement</p>
<p>The Qinghu Highway is only 25 kilometers from Shanghai (starting from Wujiagang on the Shanghai border), but the fare costs as much as 4,200 yuan, which is really too expensive! Moreover, the road surface is uneven. In these 25 kilometers, there are more than 20 bridges, only one or two of which have railings. The rest are wooden bridges without railings, only wide enough for one car to pass, with the wheels already tightly pressed against the edge of the bridge, making passengers feel frightened. The company has never repaired them. Most of the bridges can only carry a load of three metric tons, while ordinary cars are five metric tons. No wonder they fall into the river!</p>
<p>Now, we hope that the company will quickly repair the bridges along the way into permanent structures that can carry at least eight tons. Otherwise, ten-wheeled trucks will not be able to pass, and the fare should be reduced. (Jin Ziqiang)</p>

The Pacific region is under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet. The Alaska region is under the command of Major General Craig. Unaffiliated strategic air force units are under the command of General Kenney. There is no change in the civil and military governments of Guam and the former Japanese-mandated islands. This new arrangement enriches MacArthur's occupation affairs in Japan and South Korea; MacArthur's jurisdiction does not extend to the Asian continent. U.S. forces in China are still under the command of Lieutenant General Gillem, with headquarters in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press Honolulu 17th] President Truman's announcement today to revise the command authority of the Army and Navy can clear up the cause of the friction between the Army and Navy in the Pacific region that has been going on for months. This time, the new command authority in the central Pacific region gives the command authority of the Army in Hawaii to the Navy and restricts MacArthur's command authority over the Army in the central Pacific, effectively restoring the authority that the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet had before 1945. A few weeks ago, naval officials here told the press that there was an "intolerable" situation in the Pacific Command. The Navy felt that although it was responsible for the central Pacific, it had no power to carry out this mission.</p>

<p>[United Press New York 17th] The New York Herald Tribune reported today that the U.S. Army is moving military equipment stored on the West Coast, including heavy tanks, heavy artillery, military supplies, and transport vehicles, to locations near seaports, railways, and highway networks on the East Coast. It is said that the most important strategic storage depots are located near New York and Boston, so that reserve forces can be quickly equipped in times of emergency, or troops can be dispatched to foreign countries to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the United Nations. The report also stated that this decision is intended to make mobilization faster and not affect the U.S. transportation system.</p>
<h3 id="e61">French Socialist Party Forms Cabinet; Prime Minister Blum Concurrently Heads Foreign Affairs; Announced Policy Program to Parliament Yesterday <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 16th] France's new Prime Minister, Socialist leader Léon Blum, formed an all-Socialist cabinet today, with himself as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, Blum's cabinet is a transitional government. Once the President of the Republic is elected in January, and the Fourth French Republic decides on its first cabinet according to the constitution, it will step down.</p>
<p>According to Reuters: After the formation of the cabinet was completed, Prime Minister Blum broadcast to the nation, announcing the formation of a Socialist cabinet as an emergency measure in the face of the worsening government crisis. He said that the new cabinet's term will not exceed one month, but within this short period, it will ensure the secure protection of France's interests and freedom. In the coming days, essential laws must be passed, constitutional institutions must be established, and especially, the people must gain confidence in the country's system, currency, and future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 17th] Prime Minister Blum presented the list of the new cabinet to the National Assembly this afternoon, and delivered a speech on the spot, explaining the new cabinet's policies. On the domestic front: (1) strictly balancing the budget; (2) increasing production; (3) facilitating the flow of goods; (4) stabilizing prices and currency values; (5) increasing taxes on the propertied class and exempting the salaried class from taxes. On the diplomatic front: (1) merging the economy of the German Saar region; (2) opposing any revival of Germany's wartime industries; (3) close cooperation with the United Nations; (4) maintaining France's traditional friendship; (5) Germany using exported coal to compensate France.</p>
<p>Cabinet List</p>
<p>The full list of the new cabinet is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Léon Blum</p>
<p>Minister of State</p>
<p>Mollet and Lauter</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Lamadier</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior Taipurou</p>
<p>Minister of National Defense Troquet</p>
<p>Minister of Planning Goun</p>
<p>Minister of Finance and Economy Philippe</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture Prishang</p>
<p>Minister of Industrial Production La Guster</p>
<p>Minister of Education Naqilan</p>
<p>Minister of Public Works and Transportation Mosh</p>
<p>Minister of Overseas Territories Mutai</p>
<p>Minister of Labor and Social Security Mayi</p>
<p>Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Thomas</p>
<p>Minister of Health and Population Seniyi</p>
<p>Minister of Veterans Lecena</p>
<p>Regarding the Minister of National Defense, Troquet, a Socialist leader with a reputation since before the war, is an openly anti-communist figure. When the Vichy government tried the leaders of the Third Republic, Troquet was Blum's defense lawyer. The former Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, Goun, is responsible for presiding over the four-year construction plan. The Minister of Finance is Philippe, the Minister of Finance in De Gaulle's cabinet.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Blum</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 17th] Blum's attempt to form a coalition cabinet failed because the right wing refused to allow the Communist Party to take the position of Minister of National Defense in the new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 16th] Political observers here recently stated that Prime Minister Blum is scheduled to present the entire Socialist cabinet to the National Assembly tomorrow afternoon and will surely gain the support of a majority of members. Other parties are also willing to have Blum's cabinet be responsible for taking the strict measures needed for the current economic situation. Among them, Communist leader Thorez said: "We not only support Blum, but also help him move forward." As for Blum's plan to organize a national unity cabinet, the Communist Party is not responsible for this failure, because the Communist Party has already made concessions time and again. Schumann, the leader of the People's Republican Movement, also made a statement of a similar nature.</p>

British officials also pointed out that the last time the U.S. government issued an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government for forcing a U.S. plane to land, the deadline was only 48 hours.</p>

<p>Statements by Representatives of Four Countries</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, New York 16th] The United Nations Security Council met tonight to discuss the Greek appeal case. Representatives of Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania were invited to attend and state their views. The Yugoslav representative, Karkovich, spoke first, criticizing the Greek Prime Minister for making inaccurate statements to the Security Council, intentionally damaging the prestige of Yugoslavia and causing misunderstandings. The Albanian representative, Roha, followed, requesting the Security Council to reject the Greek proposals, saying that the sections condemned in these proposals were sufficient to endanger peace and security. Greece is now attempting to provoke Albania, making its territorial claims reasonable. I hereby request the Security Council to send an investigation committee to conduct an on-site investigation of the northern border of Greece. The Bulgarian political representative to the United States, Stoichev, said: Bulgaria has been "slandered" by Greek newspapers, and the accusations made by Greece are completely unfounded. Finally, the Greek Prime Minister explained Greece's position, reiterating that Yugoslavia is supplying Greek rebels with weapons, and that all incidents have occurred within Greek territory. Greece has no intention of expanding its territory. I do not believe it. Member states of the Security Council are welcome to send their representatives stationed in Greece to investigate the facts.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] London 17th Broadcast; It was rumored that Nehru had said that India would declare independence from Britain within three days. His acting spokesperson firmly denied the report.</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi 16th] Indian Interim Government Home Minister Patel, while controlling the Constituent Assembly debate on Nehru's "Bill Declaring India as an Independent Republic with Royal Authority," stated in his speech that the recent British government's statement on India had new concessions to the Muslim League that exceeded those stated in the British statement of May 16. We have not accepted it, and this assembly will never accept any other new concessions. Liberal politician Jayakar proposed an amendment to Nehru's resolution, requesting that discussions on the Indian constitution be postponed until the Muslim League and other independent states participate in the Constituent Assembly. He said that it would be wrong, illegal, and dangerous to pass the constitution today, and it would be enough to cause great turmoil. The debate on the bill will continue tomorrow. The Communist Party's proposal to redraft Nehru's constitutional draft was rejected.

<p>— By Professor Carr, translated specifically for this newspaper by the editorial department</p>
<p>The backbone of current British foreign policy should be to neither stray from the United States nor offend the Soviet Union, but rather to seek balance between the two.</p>
<p>Today, when we discuss foreign policy, touching upon the European continent and the rest of the overseas world, the first thing that comes to mind is the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Union has suffered appalling plunder and losses due to the German invasion. Before it can equip itself to become an active and outstanding member of the world political stage, it faces a vast reconstruction plan, both spiritually and materially. Although the United States possesses all the elements of material power, the extent to which its people bear a desire for a progressive policy, especially a progressive European policy, is still undecided. The difference in attitude between the Soviet Union and the United States in the future is that the former's strength may increase due to the progress of domestic reconstruction work, thus making its actions in Europe more effective. The latter's aversion to excessive involvement in European affairs will increase accordingly. Therefore, in the future, we may see that the Soviet Union's influence on the European continent will be greater than it is today, while the United States' influence will be smaller than it is today. If this is indeed the case, it is obvious that the main task of British foreign policy is to seek a balance between a Europe with the Soviet Union as the main force and an overseas world with the United States as the main force.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Cannot Be Hostile</p>
<p>I probably don't need to elaborate on the fact that Britain cannot participate in any alliance of continental European countries that are hostile to the world, especially the United States and its dominions. Since the First World War, it has become an unbreakable truth that Britain absolutely cannot participate in any military intervention that the United States does not participate in, or at least remains neutral but does not actually tend to agree with. The United States cannot, in fact, be completely unconcerned about European unification. However, if European unity achieves any effective success, by definition it must exclude the United States, or we can say that it is turning a knife against the United States. Britain can never participate in such a combination. Absolute non-participation in a solely European alliance may become the basis of British foreign policy.</p>
<p>However, it is equally true that Britain cannot base its foreign policy on combining with the world outside Europe while turning a knife against Europe itself. Regarding this point, I would like to elaborate slightly. Because there is a natural tendency for people to believe that language is a truly effective bond, and that the tradition and sentiment of unity in the English-speaking world can itself become the foundation for forging and stabilizing a political group. The United States was the first to warn us that this idea is a dangerous illusion. The United States contains a rather strong anti-British tendency in its political tradition. Even today, any overly close cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States internationally will cause the United States to harbor a special suspicion of being asked to "bail someone out of trouble." Wallace, in the speech that forced his resignation, said something similar, but he did not take responsibility for the speech.</p>
<p>The Tripartite Alliance Should Be Maintained</p>
<p>Therefore, I have learned that just as allying with the United States and the Soviet Union in the war was a major condition for winning victory, it seems to have equal importance in peacetime for guaranteeing security. Such a tripartite alliance is as necessary today as it was in the past. At the same time, this is also the condition for guaranteeing Britain's domestic security and foreign interests. If Britain cannot maintain friendship and mutual understanding with the United States, its interests in the Far East and the Pacific will not be able to develop. I am also equally certain that if a policy of friendship and understanding is not adopted towards the Soviet Union, Britain's interests in the Middle East (a large collection of countries from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean to the border of India) will ultimately not be able to be maintained or utilized.</p>
<p>The governments established by many European countries are indeed not very sound. From our perspective, they are not good governments at all, and we even harbor many dissatisfactions towards them. However, I don't think that the opinions of Britain and the United States are likely to be accepted by these countries, nor can they induce them to reorganize their governments to conform to Western liberal democratic forms. We must remember that since the First World War, almost every country in Central and Eastern Europe has completed a Western-style democratic constitution, but the governments produced under these constitutions have mostly been either corrupt or incompetent, or both. When such governments collapse, no one mourns. We must know that although liberal democracy in the Western Hemisphere has many qualities that we admire, it is not a standard form that can be applied everywhere, but only a form of government produced by certain nations at a certain stage of their development. Just as plants grow vigorously in suitable soil, but wither and die once they are transplanted to unsuitable soil, this kind of democracy has never actually taken root on land outside of Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Foreign Goods Dumping Creates a Crisis; Representatives of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association Go to Nanjing to Petition; Calling on the Government to Provide Loans for Relief <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Amid the influx of foreign goods, the crisis in China's pharmaceutical industry is becoming more serious than in other industries. The pharmaceutical industry has reached a point where it can no longer exist. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association has specially sent representatives Gu Keming, Yao Junzhi, Ni Jingfu, Yang Shuxun, Chen Mingshan, Hu Jiayu, Huang Sufeng, Cao Zan Chu and others, as well as Jin Runxiang from the Chamber of Commerce and Tian Heqing from the Industrial Association, to form a petition group to go to Nanjing by car last night to petition, calling on the government and people from all walks of life to pay attention to the crisis facing the pharmaceutical industry and provide the necessary relief.</p>
<p>Reception for Journalists Last Night</p>
<p>The association also held a reception for the media from this country at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Yao Junzhi reported on the situation. He bitterly complained about the serious crisis facing China's pharmaceutical industry due to the threat of foreign drug dumping, the impact of purchasing surplus materials containing drugs, and the pressure of high-interest loans for production, which has caused more than 300 factories to close down, leaving only 70 or so factories that cannot continue to operate. Yao said: Currently, 44 pharmaceutical factories urgently need a total loan of 12,355,000,000 yuan. At present, they are all on the verge of shutdown due to poor economic turnover. If the government provides timely loans, they can still be saved. Then Tian said in detail about the various difficulties of the industry's inability to balance income and expenditure, the excessive arrival of foreign drugs, and the lack of outlets for domestic drugs, and especially pointed out that the members of the association are part of the national industry. The association put forward oral demands, calling on the government and relevant parties to provide relief: (1) Because the pharmaceutical industry's research and advertising expenses are overdrawn too much, the government should consider the focus of each factory's investment when providing loans, and not use pharmaceutical finished products as collateral. (2) We respectfully request that our government order the Materials Supply Bureau to bundle domestic pharmaceuticals with American military surplus pharmaceuticals when allocating them to various pharmaceutical merchants, with a ratio of 20%. (3) Regarding the restriction of imports of foreign pharmaceuticals, it can be divided into three steps. Preliminary raw materials can be imported, drug chemicals should be restricted from import, and pharmaceutical finished products should be prohibited from import at any time. The association stated that this petition group intends to host reporters and National Assembly representatives in Nanjing. If a satisfactory answer is not obtained, the members of the association will collectively stop production.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The year is rapidly coming to an end - the calendar pages fly away silently one by one, and these days it seems to be flying faster and faster: Only a few days are left in the 35th year of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Let the past be the past! After eight years of arduous war, perhaps we had too high expectations for this year, and therefore we cannot avoid the sadness of a bit of disillusionment. However, hardship and difficulty are the best training - the four thousand years of history of the Republic of China are by no means accidental, we have nothing to fear!</p>
<p>If there are mistakes, we should resolutely correct them. No matter how rugged the long road ahead may be, as long as we have the courage to grit our teeth and move forward, what harm is there in looking back? Moreover, the "past" is not necessarily without any pleasing aspects! Therefore, we have launched the election of the top ten news stories of the 35th year of the Republic of China, divided into "Chinese" and "Shanghai" sections. The faces of the country and this city in the 35th year of the Republic of China can be represented by these items.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Rapidly Ending Year with Many Disputes: Workers at the General Electric Light Bulb Factory Demand Reinstatement After Being Dismissed <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The General Electric Edison Light Bulb Company on Changshou Road in this city was originally operated by an American businessman. It was occupied by the Japanese during the war. At the beginning of the victory, it was first taken over by Denmark as an agent. On September 30th of the 34th year of the Republic of China, more than 200 workers were dismissed, and each person was given 150 light bulbs as severance pay. On December 1st of last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs formally returned the factory to the American original owner for reorganization and resumption of business. However, since the factory resumed work, it has only hired more than 80 workers, specializing in the manufacture of light bulb filaments. The glass shells are manufactured and supplied by other factories through three employees of the factory. The scope of manufacturing is not as large as before the war, and the number of workers hired has also decreased. However, the workers who were dismissed last September believe that they were exiting a factory that was occupied by the Japanese, not the General Electric Company. Now that the Americans have taken over the original factory, they have the right to demand reinstatement. Because repeated requests were unsuccessful, they intercepted the glass shells being transported to the factory at around 2:00 PM yesterday and twisted them to the police station. The matter has now been submitted by the labor side to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, but because both labor and management have reasons, it is difficult to make a fair judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Coal Price Review Committee Decides to Initially Allocate 6,000 Tons of Coal; Discussion of Coal Briquette Supervision Issue to Be Held After Coal Arrives <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, representatives from six units, including the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the Coal Briquette Retail Industry Association, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held the first meeting of the Coal Price Review Committee at the Social Affairs Bureau. After a thorough discussion of more than two hours, the following major cases were resolved: (1) The meeting date of this committee is set to be held once every two weeks, with the time being 3:00 PM on Friday. (2) The price of bituminous coal was reserved and not decided because the representative of the bituminous coal merchants did not attend. (3) The coal briquette cost form will be submitted to a group for review. The group will be organized by representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, and the Coal Briquette Retail Industry Association. (4) Allocation issue: It was decided to initially allocate 6,000 tons. The allocation method will be formulated by the Fuel Management Committee and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. (5) After new members join the association, they should enjoy the same rights. It was resolved that newly established coal briquette factories should enjoy the same right to allocate coal after completing commercial registration. Non-member factories should be urged to register as soon as possible, otherwise they will not be allocated. (6) The issue of coal briquette supervision will be discussed after the coal arrives.</p>
<p>(Another report) Regarding the allocation of coal for coal briquettes in this city, there are two central issues: (1) Cost issue. The production costs of large and small factories are not uniform. Some people advocate dividing them into two levels to take care of the interests of small factories. The cost review team is scheduled to meet again at the Social Affairs Bureau tomorrow. Factories attach the most importance to this, so it is handled very carefully. (2) Allocation issue. Some people are concerned that there may be abuses when coal briquettes are sold by retailers to citizens in the future, such as poor quality or a lack of goods that should not occur. Therefore, it is suggested that retail sales should be carried out in different districts in the future, with a person in charge designated in each district. The competent authorities will strictly supervise them at any time, and if there are any abuses, they will be severely punished. The review committee is scheduled to meet again at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Another report) According to personnel from the Social Affairs Bureau who told reporters, around the 18th of this month, the American ship "Yunni Tai" will transport 6,000 tons of Annam white coal to Shanghai. The competent authorities hope that this batch of coal can still be sold at a price of 100,000 yuan per ton.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's second ban on the sale of enemy and puppet real estate has sold two batches so far, but the houses in Jia Alley have always lacked buyers. The third bidding and sale will be handled in January next year, or it will mostly be vacant land to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>The issue of bidding and selling the houses in Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road has always attracted much attention. Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council has also sent a letter to the China Trust Bureau, asking it to handle the matter carefully. It is reported that if approved by the Executive Yuan, the villa houses will be sold separately, and the original residents will have the right to purchase them first within a limited time.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machine Federation is an organization formed by well-known domestic goods factories in this city. It is now hosting a broadcast promoting the use of domestic goods on the Shanghai Youth Radio Station (frequency 2200). Every day there are domestic goods business news, Chinese professors, medical consultants, and Jiao Dongqiaozi speaks on "Cooking Secrets," Li Amao speaks on "One Thousand and One Nights," Miss Zhu Meiling speaks on "The Way of Husband and Wife," and there are also Zhang Yunfu's Shanghai opera, Yu Dou Tangyingying's a cappella singing, and a comedy skit, etc., with everything you could want. The purpose is to introduce high-quality domestic goods so that buyers can easily choose them, so the significance is very profound. It has now begun trial broadcasting and will officially open on a selected day.</p>
<h3 id="e89">40 Billion Yuan of the Municipal Government's Budget for Next Year Comes From: National Obligatory Labor Decides to Collect a Substitute Fee, Stipulating 5,000 Yuan Per Person Per Day <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to reporters who learned from confidential sources in the Municipal Government yesterday: Among the income that can be increased in this city's budget for next year, the source of this income is the substitute fee for national obligatory labor.</p>
<p>According to the decree of the Central Ministry of the Interior, able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 must perform three days of obligatory service for the country every year. (This city has increased it to ten days) Those who are unwilling to work can use cash as a substitute. The population of this city is more than four million people. The number of able-bodied men who should perform obligatory service is estimated to be one-fifth of the total population, or more than 800,000 people. If the daily substitute fee is calculated at 5,000 yuan, then the total amount that can be obtained is 40 billion yuan, which is 40 billion yuan of income that the Municipal Government can increase next year.</p>
<p>Because the difference between income and expenditure of the Municipal Government next year is too large, the budget form has not been completed so far. After the budgets of the various bureaus and departments were withdrawn and re-edited at last week's municipal meeting, they have been tightened as much as possible. According to estimates from related parties: The total budget of this city next year is about 250 billion yuan. According to statistics from the Finance Bureau, the total income of this city next year is more than 230 billion yuan. With the addition of 40 billion yuan in labor substitute fees, the income can reach 270 billion yuan, so the Municipal Government's income and expenditure next year can be balanced, and it is believed that its budget form can be finalized at this week's municipal meeting.</p>
<p>Also, according to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau who told reporters yesterday: It has not yet been decided whether the municipal construction donation in this city can be collected as usual next year. The collection of this tax was decided by the first Municipal Council, and its purpose was to make up for the inability of income and expenditure to offset each other in the second half of the 35th year. It was decided at that time that new sources of income must be sought for the 36th year. However, the Finance Bureau, in view of the fact that the financial situation of this city next year is still very tight, has submitted a request to the Council to continue to collect it for another year. The Finance Bureau's estimated total income of more than 230 billion yuan for this city next year already includes more than 20 billion yuan in municipal construction donations.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Nidareid Wheel Will Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Nidareid, managed by the Norwegian Washington Company, is carrying more than 35,000 bags of relief flour from the United States to Shanghai. It sailed to the waters off Fuzhou the day before yesterday. When the fuel ran out, it went to Fuzhou to purchase coal. According to a telegram from the Washington Company: It will leave Rongbei today and is expected to arrive within this week. It is also learned that the ship was purchased by the Sanbei Steamboat Company. After the goods arrive and are unloaded, it will be handed over to the Sanbei Company. However, the ship has been in disrepair for many years and needs to be repaired after the Sanbei Company takes over.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Lin Sen Middle Road Bloodshed: Inside Story of Russian Merchant's Murder-Suicide; Three Letters Involving Consulate Commercial Counselor; Will Distributes Furniture and Possessions to Multiple Relatives <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Alexander Kotunin, a 46-year-old Russian man, formerly a U.S. military police officer and now a woolen merchant, and his wife, Sophia Kotunin, 35, resided at 1021 Lin Sen Middle Road. At approximately 11:55 PM the night before, a Russian child arrived by car at the Changshu Sub-Bureau to report a bloody incident at that address. Chief Wang led police to the scene for investigation, where they found Alexander rolling around near the staircase, the room in disarray. His wife was lying on the bed, with two axe wounds to the right side of her face, one axe embedded in her right skull and still not removed, barely alive. It was later learned that Alexander had committed the crime and, fearing punishment, had taken poison to commit suicide. Purple potassium cyanide granules were found on the floor, presumably the poison he had ingested. Changshu police immediately rushed Alexander to the police hospital for emergency treatment, but he died at 9:30 AM the following morning. Sophia was also taken to Guangci Hospital, where doctors managed to remove the axe, but she remains in critical condition.</p>
<p>Police officers found three letters in the room, translated from the original as follows: (1) To Soviet Bishop John, approximately thirteen pages long, mentioning that his wife had been seduced by the Consulate's Commercial Counselor, Achiv. (2) Briefly stated: Your government officials must punish those responsible for the tragic deaths of two people, Commercial Counselor Achiv, whose sins led to the loss of two lives; he is my wife's lover. Signed, Alexander Kotunin. (3) The will stated: The furniture in my house is gifted to the Soviet Catholic Church; my personal belongings are gifted to my father-in-law; the silver fox fur coat, the large gold ring, and one kimono, and two coats, are left to my daughter Olga; my new coat to Yibi; the entire set of tableware is divided equally among Yibi, Jianayuntianai, and Sulalye; the deeds and cash are also divided equally among them. The money from the General Association is also to be given to Yibi, Jiana, and Yuntianai; the smoking set to Dima; the small diamond ring to the one who bought it. My last wish is that the person responsible for this bloody tragedy is Achiv, who attempted to make my wife leave me and our son, because the wealthy are all-powerful, and they are tempted by money and luxury.</p>
<p>Considering the above letters, the case appears to involve a love triangle. The full details remain under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e92">### Allegations of Bribery Against Xuan Tiewu; Investigation Underway to Determine Source of Rumors <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to yesterday's evening paper, Xuan Tiewu, Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Command and Chief of the Police Bureau of this city, was recently accused by someone in a formal complaint to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for corruption and dereliction of duty. It is alleged that a certain Russian expatriate in this city, suspected of being an enemy agent, previously obtained an exit passport from the Police Bureau to return to his home country. This Russian expatriate had been reported by a foreign national, and now the original informant has filed a complaint with our Executive Yuan and other agencies, alleging that Xuan received a bribe of US$270,000 and allowed the Russian expatriate to leave the country privately.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Commander Xuan stated: that this matter has no factual basis whatsoever. The Police Bureau has always carefully handled the issuance of exit or domestic travel passports to foreigners in accordance with regulations. All stateless expatriates or those from countries without diplomatic relations who apply for an exit visa must obtain a guarantee from a reputable business, ensuring that there are no outstanding civil or criminal cases against them, before a visa is issued. No one suspected of being an enemy agent has ever been authorized to leave without permission, as records can attest. Furthermore, no Russian expatriates are on the list of war criminals.</p>
<p>Xuan also stated that the purpose of these rumors is unknown, but the fact that they damage the reputation of the Police Bureau and himself is undeniable. He is currently investigating the source of these rumors and instructed all officers at the Garrison Command's anniversary celebration the day before to assist the Police Bureau in tracking down the source of the rumors. Xuan is confident that these unfounded rumors will soon collapse on their own.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Salvation Army to Build Shelter for the Needy; Distributing "Happiness Bags" for Christmas <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] As the harsh winter sets in, the Salvation Army, which has been conducting various charitable activities in China for thirty years, has observed a growing number of homeless refugees on the streets without food or clothing. In addition to strengthening its usual relief efforts, regularly providing refugees with buns, clothing, and medical care, it has recently decided to expand its winter relief efforts by establishing a large-scale shelter. The necessary funds have been discussed with Continental Daily News to jointly launch a fundraising campaign to raise 20 million yuan for the construction. According to Wei Lecze, the Salvation Army's Shanghai Regional Director, and Chang Ziying, the Regional Director, the blueprint for the planned shelter has been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The location has been selected at the intersection of Dong Jiaxing Road and Desiwei Road in Hongkou, and construction will begin soon, with completion expected by the end of this month. It is planned to begin accepting refugees at the beginning of next month, with an initial capacity of 300 people. If donations exceed the target amount, the capacity will be increased accordingly. The beds needed have been agreed upon with the United Relief Association, which will provide them in full. The collection point is located at 25 Sassoon Building on the Bund, Nanjing Road (telephone 13113), in the Continental Daily News. It is hoped that all sectors of society will generously contribute and join in this great endeavor. Furthermore, as Christmas approaches, the Salvation Army has specially prepared 1,600 emergency bags (or "Happiness Bags") for distribution to refugees, containing items such as towels, wool socks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor sets, soap, sunglasses, stationery, pencils, candies, and handkerchiefs, with a total value of over 30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Sichuan Road Police Bureau recently received a tip-off that a large group of bandits was hiding at 15 Qianyi Lane, Tiantong Road. Chief Zhou Nan led Inspectors Xie Zhiguang, Police Chiefs Wang Shubei and Zhang De, and officers Wang Ersheng, Tang Lunmei, Wei Shulin, and Zhang Xianzhang to the location. At midnight, they forced entry and apprehended a young woman, Ling Lindi (22 years old, from Yancheng), and confiscated a German-made pistol with four bullets. After interrogating her at the bureau, she provided no information. Subsequent searches of various hotels also yielded nothing. However, yesterday, the bandit Chen Laitao, 21 years old, from Nantong, was arrested at 97 Baoshan Road. He confessed that his accomplices were staying at Room 205 of the Ningbo Merchants Hotel on Tianjin Road. Three more thieves were subsequently apprehended: Cao Fusheng, 28 years old, Li Miaohong, 24 years old, and Chen Zhuzhu, 23 years old, all from Nantong. They confessed that on July 29th at 7:00 PM, they robbed the Fuxing Grocery Store at 336 North Baoxing Road. The victim was Dai Wu, who lost 350,000 yuan in legal tender and over a million yuan in clothing and accessories. They had previously committed several robberies in the Jiangwan and Hongkou jurisdictions. The sub-bureau has applied for their detention and plans to hand them over to the Garrison Command for further investigation upon completion of the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Lishi Society: Noble Mission to Improve Welfare of Military Personnel; Spare No Effort in Entertaining Allied Officers; Recently to Take Over Broadway Mansions <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report] During the eight years of the War of Resistance, especially in the final three years approaching victory, the Lishi Society, established eighteen years ago, was directly responsible for entertaining Allied officers entering China.</p>
<p>The Lishi Society was established two years after the success of the Northern Expedition. Its nature and mission were simply to serve the officers and soldiers of the army and improve the welfare of military personnel. Similar organizations are called Kaikosha in Japan and the Army YMCA in the UK and USA. The Lishi Society's target group is the officers and soldiers of the army, just as the New Life Movement's target group is the general public. Its work has some similarities to the army's Political Department (now renamed the News Bureau), but its existence does not overlap with the army's Political Department. The army's Political Department's target group is limited to the officers and soldiers of its own unit, while the members of the Lishi Society are general officers and soldiers who have joined the society through certain procedures. A certain company commander from Army A or a certain lower-ranking soldier from Division B can all apply to join the society, and after joining, they all have certain rights and obligations.</p>
<p>The Lishi Society's work had already achieved good results before the war. The buildings of the Nanjing General Society, as well as their exquisite design and scientific management, were often praised. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the number of Allied troops entering China increased daily, and the arduous task of entertaining the Allied troops fell on the shoulders of the Lishi Society.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Lishi Society, one is naturally reminded of the New Life Movement General Association, because the actual person in charge of both groups is the Secretary-General Huang Renlin, who is described as tall and strong. With his talent and connections in various fields, it is naturally the most appropriate for him to preside over the work of entertaining the Allied troops.</p>
<p>Entertaining the Allied troops is not a simple matter. The term "entertaining" implies a relationship between guest and host. It is already difficult for a host to please a guest, and the scarcity of resources during the War of Resistance made it even more difficult. The Allied troops who came to China had originally enjoyed a high standard of living and mostly held a sense of superiority. The hosts responsible for entertaining them had to not only provide them with daily necessities as much as possible but also pay attention to their physical and mental health and needs, because the two armies were fighting side by side, which was directly related to the victory or defeat of the war and indirectly related to the future friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>From the perspective of entertaining the Allied troops, we can see that the efforts of the Lishi Society were multifaceted. We have no way of obtaining statistics on the actual number of Allied troops who came to China, but in terms of entertaining, the Lishi Society had an obligation to entertain every Allied officer and soldier who entered China. After 1941, Kunming, where the Allied troops were most concentrated, and Chengdu, where the most decisions were made, needed seven or eight hundred head of cattle, four or five hundred pigs, and tens of thousands of eggs every day. As a result, the price of meat in neighboring provinces and counties soared. In the locations where the Allied troops were stationed, the Lishi Society had to set up comfortable and thoughtful reception centers for them, and even the tea servers and servants had to be trained in the European style. In terms of mental needs, they regularly held musical performances, sports competitions, founded camp publications, and held dances. Everything that could be thought of and done, the designers of the Lishi Society spent all their energy "arranging" for the Allied troops.</p>
<p>In order to entertain the Allied troops, the Lishi Society specially set up a battlefield service group, which was distributed in the locations where the Allied troops were stationed. Even as far as India and Burma, the members of the service group left their footprints. They also co-organized an interpreter training class with the now-defunct Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, writing an unforgettable page for Sino-American cooperation.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, although the battlefield service group has ended, the work of the Lishi Society has become stronger. There are two reception centers, nine reception centers in the Shanghai branch, and fourteen reception centers in Peiping. The four reception centers in the Northeast will be closed in the short term due to the war. The main guests in the reception centers everywhere are now the personnel of the Coordination Executive Headquarters, with more than 500 people. The Lishi Society is responsible for providing adequate accommodation, but the guests are now responsible for their own food.

<p>[Our Report] Recently, this reporter noted that foreign kerosene companies were dissatisfied with the Import Control Commission's determination of current import quotas based on pre-war kerosene import volumes, which did not match the current surge in fuel consumption, preventing the oil companies from fully utilizing their kerosene reserves to meet market demand. This reporter visited Mr. Chen Changtong, Chief of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Import Control Commission, who stated that the Commission's regulations on import quotas, in addition to referencing the import volumes of 1935, 1936, and 1937, also need to reference the import volumes of 1946. The reason for referencing the import volumes of 1946 is that, in view of the post-victory situation, China's demand for certain imported goods may have changed, so the import quotas can be adjusted according to the actual situation. For example, if the import volume of kerosene has increased sharply after the victory, then when allocating quotas, it must be based on changes in the actual situation and increase the import quota. There is absolutely no reason to completely base it on pre-war import volumes. Therefore, the current concerns of kerosene importers are unnecessary. Although the current quota has not yet been determined, the import of kerosene is still proceeding smoothly, and there have been no changes due to the promulgation of the revised import and export trade regulations.</p>

At the same time, Chen Xiancheng and Zhang Xiaozhang, two accountants at the front desk, witnessed this situation and expressed their dissatisfaction, as the visitor was indeed Jin's father-in-law, whom they knew well. They argued reasonably, and a quarrel broke out. Unexpectedly, Wu and others retreated backstage and gathered more than a dozen actors, who rushed out and grabbed Chen and others, beating them severely. This caused great chaos in the theater, and the audience dispersed in droves.

<p>[Our Report] The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beijing Flight 31, which crashed in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, on the afternoon of the 14th, carried 1.2 billion yuan in national currency. The Bank of China had previously taken out safety insurance with the China Property Insurance Company, with coverage of 600 million yuan. It is now learned that 17 of the packages (based on 31 packages totaling 1.2 billion yuan, 17 packages would amount to over 660 million yuan) were not burned and have been safely kept by the Changxing County government after being recovered.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Changxing County government, the China National Aviation Corporation, in addition to dispatching personnel from the company, the Bank of China, and the China Insurance Company that night to investigate via Jiaxing by train, learned yesterday morning that there was a small airport in Changxing that could accommodate airplanes. At noon, they dispatched another plane, personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Aviation Division. The company's secretary, Wu Lieqi, and Zhou Kechang, Assistant Manager of the Bank of China, accompanied him, and they also brought a Jeep. They took off from Shanghai at 11:00 AM and landed in Changxing at a small airfield ten kilometers from the accident site, the Dragon King Temple, and then drove by Jeep to investigate. They stayed there that night and will continue their investigation today. Director Chen Wenkuan and others flew back to Shanghai around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>According to Chen last night, he himself did not travel by car after landing in order to take care of the plane, but only saw the wreckage of the crashed passenger plane, which had been moved to the Dragon King Temple, from the air while circling, and most of it was damaged. Later, Bank of China personnel informed him that 17 packages of banknotes had been recovered, but the cause of the passenger plane crash could not be determined at this time.</p>

<p>Secretary Wu Lieqi, upon returning to Shanghai, told reporters about the accident: Flight 47 took off at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. At 11:45 AM, it arrived over Changxing. Looking down on Changxing, the hills rose and fell, and the mountain ranges were intertwined. It circled low for two weeks and saw the wreckage of Flight 31 lying on the side of Nong Mountain. Then it went to Changxing City. After landing, it went to Changxing County Hall to visit County Magistrate Cheng. According to County Magistrate Cheng, the mountain roads were rugged, and it would take more than four hours to travel back and forth. He stopped them from entering because he was afraid that they would not be able to return to Shanghai that day due to the short time. He then told in detail about the accident of Flight 31: At about 4:00 PM on the 14th, the people of Changxing saw a plane flying rapidly from the west. Soon they heard a loud noise and thought it was an accident. He hurriedly ordered people to go to the Nengwang Temple on the top of Nong Mountain to investigate. According to the township chief of the area: at that time, the villagers at the foot of Dragon King Temple Mountain saw many pieces of paper falling from the top of the mountain. Knowing that it was something from the plane, they flocked to see it. They were shocked to find that it was colorful banknotes. For a while, they cheered and scrambled to pick them up, causing a sensation among the nearby residents. They rushed forward, fully loaded and returned, because after the banknotes fell, they piled up on the ground. It was easy to pick up, as easy as taking something out of a bag. When the county government personnel arrived, they joined forces with the township chiefs to prohibit the villagers from picking them up and ordered people to quickly collect them in linen bags, totaling twenty bags. At the same time, they sent people to guard the five bodies of the deceased. The fuselage of Flight 31 did not catch fire, it was only smashed to pieces. All the deceased were killed by the impact. The wooden boxes for packing banknotes could not be found. At this point, the twenty bags of banknotes have been transported to the county government for preservation. The Changxing County Government, the Changxing Court Procuratorate, and the local township chiefs have signed and sealed them. The court has also sent people to the scene of the accident to verify the bodies and report to the superiors for the record. The bodies have now been transported to the Changxing County Government.</p>
<p>When Director Chen Wenkuan, Secretary Wu Lieqi, Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang, and others arrived at the Changxing County Government, Manager Chen of the Huzhou branch of the Bank of China had also rushed to Changxing from Huzhou. Together with Zhou, he discussed with the Changxing County Government the process of the banknotes falling and the villagers抢拾picking them up. He电吿telegraphed Shanghai last night. Zhou and Chen are still staying in Changxing, waiting for instructions from their superiors before deciding how to deal with the situation. Except for four people guarding the bodies, Director Chen and Secretary Wu flew back to Shanghai on the original plane at 4:45 PM yesterday afternoon and arrived here at about 5:30 PM. It is scheduled to send a plane to Changxing again tomorrow (the 19th) to transport the bodies to Shanghai.</p>

<p>[Our Report] According to an investigation by the Bureau of Public Health, the various funeral homes and coffin storage facilities in the city are holding 150,000 stockpiled coffins. Families with stockpiled coffins have been notified to urgently relocate them. If they are not moved after April of next year, they will be treated as unclaimed coffins and cremated. The bureau currently has two crematories, one located on Jing'an Temple Road, which uses gas for cremation, and another on Hami Road, which uses wood for cremation.

<p>[Our Report] At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, in front of Hengye Company at No. 47, Lujiazhai Alley, Sipaillou, Nanshi, Ni Xiangshui (nicknamed "Bomb," 27 years old, from Ningbo), the manager of a fruit store, was suddenly ambushed by more than 20 thugs lying in wait, who used axes and knives to slash at him. He was stabbed fourteen times on the spot, and blood flowed freely, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain. The thugs, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, dispersed in a rush. Afterwards, Ni struggled to crawl to the entrance of the alley, where he hired a rickshaw to report the incident to the Yimiao Police Station, which dispatched Inspector Fan Boxiong and police officers Yang Qingyuan, Chen Wanfu, Luo Zhiyuan, and Zhu Daoxian to investigate the scene. Four knives were seized at the scene. The perpetrators were still being closely investigated as of late evening.</p>
<p>According to an investigation by reporters, the victim, Ni Xiangshui, lived at No. 30, Guanyi Street, Nanshi, and is currently the manager of Xiangxing Fruit Store on Fangbang East Road. He has considerable potential influence in the Shiliupu area, with a large number of followers, mostly fruit vendors in the area. Recently, one of his followers, named "Little Shandong," tried to forcibly buy fruit from Quanji Fruit Store at No. 62, Fangbang East Road, but failed. He gathered a crowd to drag out and beat Chen Jigui (37 years old, from Ningbo), the old clerk of the store. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chen discovered Fang Xingnan, a vendor who had participated in the attack, near Shiliupu. Chen, seeking revenge, also gathered old clerks to question him. However, Fang refused to be outdone and immediately summoned nearby vendors, leading to another brawl. Chen Jigui, Fang Xiangzhang, Zeng Linquan, Ni Xiangyou, Ding Along, and five others from the old clerks' side were beaten and injured. After the police arrived, both sides were taken to the Yimiao Police Station. After learning the details, the injured old clerks were released on bail for medical treatment, while the perpetrators Fang Xingnan, Zhu Jiaxiang, Zhou Hongbao, and Xu Baoting were detained on suspicion of disturbing the peace and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for processing yesterday. The mastermind behind the scenes, "Little Shandong," upon hearing the news, felt he had lost face and went to Ni Xiangyong, asking him to mediate. After Ni investigated the matter, he realized that it was his subordinate's fault and refused to intervene. "Little Shandong," seeing that his plan had failed, harbored resentment in his heart. Yesterday morning, he gathered a group of pickpockets from the Shiliupu area, armed with weapons, and ambushed Ni in Lujiazhai Alley. He then sent several accomplices who knew Ni to his residence, tricking him out. When he arrived at the alley, they attacked him. Ni's leg bone is broken, and his injuries are quite severe.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Pre-War Deposits Repaid in Silver: Defendant Believes There Is No Legal Basis, Plaintiff Claims It Is In Accordance with Human Sentiment: District Court Concludes Hearing, Sentence Set for the 21st <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] A lawsuit demanding repayment of pre-war silver dollar deposits with silver dollars or the equivalent in silver at the market price was heard at 9:00 AM yesterday morning in the Civil Division Seven of the District Court, presided over by Judge Dong Qimin. The defendant, Zhongnan Bank, was represented by lawyer Gui Yu. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Yu Congdao, stated the facts of the case, briefly stating: "The plaintiffs, Shen Haoming, Shen Cui..., Shen Meiling, and Shen Rongling, each deposited 200 silver dollars with Zhongnan Bank on May 26th of the 19th year of the Republic and February 10th of the 20th year, with a term of 15 years, to receive 1,000 silver dollars in principal and interest upon maturity, each with a deposit certificate as proof. The silver dollar deposits matured on May 26th of last year and February 10th of this year, respectively. The bank only repaid 1,000 legal tender, and the difference between the pre-war and current value of the currency is a well-known fact. Therefore, the 1,000 silver dollars due to the plaintiff should be compensated with legal tender according to the market price of silver on the date of repayment, converted at the rate of seven qian and three fen of silver per dollar, in order to be fair." Then, the defendant's lawyer, Gui Yu, stood up and argued: "When the government announced the abolition of silver dollars in the 24th year of the Republic, it stipulated that one legal tender dollar was equal to one silver dollar. There was no difference between legal tender and silver dollars. As for the depreciation of legal tender during the war, it is indeed a fact, and the bank is very sympathetic. However, the plaintiff's request to repay the deposit at the price of silver has no legal basis. Silver dollars have been abolished for a long time and cannot be regarded as currency, so it cannot be accepted." He also stated: "The repayment of 1,000 legal tender dollars is now offered. If the plaintiff believes it is unfair, then they should make a separate claim. The plaintiff's claim to repay with silver dollars is not legal, and the court has no right to make a claim on their behalf. Litigation cases are not considered unless they are made. The court is requested to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit." Lawyer Gui jokingly said: "If the enemy and puppets forcibly exchanged 'Central Reserve Certificates' at a rate of two to one for legal tender, and after the victory, the puppet currency was exchanged for legal tender at a rate of two hundred to one, then 1,000 legal tender dollars before the war would only be worth 2.50 dollars today." Judge Dong Qimin, believing that the facts of the case were clear, announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentence for the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>Wang Fengzhi asks: "I am 69 years old. For the past three months, I have choked at every meal, except when eating thin porridge. Sometimes I even vomit, with clear water flowing from my mouth. I have been treated by Western doctors, who say I am not sick, and by traditional Chinese doctors, but neither has been effective. I don't know what disease it is or how to treat it."</p>
<p>[Doctor Zhang Zhongming Responds] Choking and vomiting in old age may be a sign of stomach cancer or esophageal cancer. You should see a doctor immediately and have a stomach fluid examination and X-ray of the digestive tract.</p>
<p>(2) Deafness and Mutism After Illness</p>
<p>Hu Zhensheng asks: "My daughter, Xia Di, is only four years old. She suffered from pneumonia in January of this year. After treatment, she recovered, and she is now physically strong. However, she has lost her hearing and cannot speak, like a mute. Is this phenomenon related to pneumonia? Can it be cured?"</p>
<p>[Doctor Zhang Zhongming Responds] Pneumonia can cause otitis media (middle ear infection), but you should consult an ENT doctor to check whether it is caused by other reasons and then decide on a treatment plan.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Stabilizing Yarn Prices to Supplement Foreign Exchange: Yarn Spun From Imported Cotton Will Be Purchased By The Government: Next Year's Imported Cotton Quota Estimated at 800,000 Bales: A Small Group Will Be Established to Allocate Quotas <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that when Premier Song convened relevant personnel from the textile industry in Shanghai this time, he expressed that the government would uniformly purchase cotton yarn nationwide to make comprehensive improvements to my country's cotton spinning industry. This move is purely based on the principle of taking from the cotton spinning industry and giving back to the cotton spinning industry. Later, the people attending the meeting all stated: The Chinese people's nature is to admire freedom, and excessive restrictions may not be easy to thoroughly implement and benefit. Therefore, it was decided in principle that the yarn produced from the imported cotton part should still be purchased by the government. As for the domestic cotton part, there may not be excessive restrictions. In order to supply a huge amount of foreign exchange for cotton, the government must recover a part of the cotton yarn for the purpose of stabilizing domestic yarn prices. At the same time, in order to compensate for the huge outflow of the foreign exchange, the government will encourage the export of all materials that can supplement inflammation as much as possible to support it.</p>
<p>As for the quota for imported cotton next year, in addition to investigating the amount of cotton stored by various yarn factories, foreign firms, and flower shops, and the amount of domestic cotton that can be purchased by the end of next year, the amount of raw cotton still lacking will be calculated, which will be used as the imported cotton quota for next year. It is estimated that the quota will be approximately 800,000 bales. At a price of US$175 per bale, the total cost will be US$140 million.</p>
<p>According to news from the Spinning Management Committee: 92 member factories affiliated with the Cotton Spinning Association in the Sixth District have reported their cotton storage volume. According to statistics: The total amount of cotton stored by each factory as of the end of November this year is 220 million pounds, which is enough for each factory to use for an average of 150 days. According to Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the association, all yarn factories in each district of the country must report their cotton storage volume by the deadline, otherwise it will indicate that the factory does not need imported cotton and will lose the right to receive imported cotton in the future.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Raw Cotton Quota Allocation Review Committee will be composed of Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee, Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, and Xi Yushu, Secretary-General of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Gold Prices Soar Again Yesterday: Peak at 3.41 Million, US Dollar Also Rises by 300 Yuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold continued to rise sharply due to the prevailing optimistic sentiment. The limited supply from the Central Bank contributed to this. The morning opened at 3.25 million. After the opening, there was a slight sense of pressure, and the scattered sales were settled, and it fell to 3.17 million. However, the Hakka gangs and those with capital maintained prices, and immediately returned to 3.2 million. People's hearts were firm again, and gradually climbed to 3.29 million before the source of supply and settlement from all parties occurred. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 160 bars at a price of 3.25 million. Later, it once fell to 3.22 million. However, afterwards, people's hearts were still strong, and the buying atmosphere revived. The supply suddenly stalled, and at noon, it broke through the 3.3 million mark again. In the afternoon, it continued to advance, and trading the next day soared to more than 3.41 million before being forced to slightly retreat. As a result, the closing price rose by 165,000 compared to the previous one. Gold ornaments rose to 357,000. Silver dollars were also stable. The implicit dismantling was at par, and the implicit tightening, the interest rate was between 1 jiao and 2 fen to 1 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also passively tended to be prosperous, but the rise was not as good as the gold market, because the speculative atmosphere was fading. The US dollar initially fluctuated between 6,000 yuan and 6,200 yuan in the morning. It was mediocre in the middle, and at noon, it rose to between 6,200 and 6,400. In the afternoon, it followed the gold market, rising to 6,500 yuan at the close, an increase of 300 yuan compared to the previous one. Hong Kong dollars were very popular, and the result was also good at 100 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,230 yuan to 1,250 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,500 yuan to 1,525 yuan, and the US exchange rate was 20,000 yuan. Only the Hong Kong exchange rate had slightly more transactions, and the rest were just calculated.</p>

<p>In order to assist the dyeing and weaving industry in production and provide a basis for reviewing loans, the Joint Treasury drafted the review standards for production loans for dyeing and weaving factories through the loan sub-committee, and the board of directors resolved to change the interest rate to a provisional monthly interest rate of four percent. The minimum number of looms in a weaving factory was changed to fifty.

<p>Public bonds were extremely lackluster yesterday. The Unification C opened at 1320 yuan in the morning, immediately announcing a slight increase, returning to 1380 yuan, and finally hovering slightly. As a result, A, B, and E each rose by 20 yuan compared to the previous one, Unification C rose by 70 yuan, and Unification D rose by 30 yuan. The turnover was only more than one million yuan.</p>

<p>The Jiao Zuo lump coal market, the appetite for business is increasingly concentrated, and the market continues to rise again. Bituminous coal fines are still scarce, and the market price is gradually rising. Kaiping No. 2 fines have broken through the 400,000 yuan mark, and the supply is still scarce. Although manufacturers and colleagues previously went to Hong Kong to purchase Hongji white coal fines as a group, the market is now reviving due to high foreign exchange rates and remote delivery, and the price is shouted two or three million yuan higher per ton.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Tea Market Turning Elegant <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign firm tea market, the buying interest in Zhenzhou Xinwen is still surging, but the idea of the cargo side raising prices is like bamboo shoots after a rain, so the market is unusually elegant. In terms of prices, those with better quality each look at a show and knock on 170,000 yuan. Those with middle grades are stronger than before. For other teas, high-grade Chen Qimen, the British firm Renji, have been happy to absorb them, but the market stock is about to be exhausted. The trend is that demand exceeds supply, and it often progresses. As for Chen Zhong Qimen, which has been stable for a long time, it was still flat in the morning, and in an instant, everyone followed Rong. The imports and exports of Chen Chou Zhen and Chen Zhenmei and other flower colors are similar, and the market lacks changes. Domestic sales of red and green tea are still lifeless.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Issues of Ordered Imports: Those Shipped Before November 24 Have a Chance to Be Approved: Application Procedures Take Too Long: Merchants Strive to Simplify <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the handling of goods ordered abroad before November 17, the authorities have officially announced that goods shipped before November 24 may be considered for import approval. According to relevant personnel, there are many types of such orders. Generally, cotton may be able to obtain import permits, and newsprint also has the hope of import. Hardware goods are quite problematic. In addition, for goods shipped out after the 24th, if the owners return them to the original ship in accordance with the regulations, they will lose commercial credit and the shipping expenses will be even greater. Therefore, they are making efforts to hope that the government can handle it leniently. People engaged in the import and export industry are also deeply concerned about the possibility of allocating remaining materials to importers. They believe that although there are many such materials, it is doubtful whether they can meet market needs. Even if there are valuable civilian goods, they may have already fallen into the hands of merchants with special backgrounds, and the legitimate merchant income may be the remaining of the remaining materials. The government is currently implementing an import licensing system on one hand and shipping large quantities of surplus materials on the other, striving for a balance of international payments. The intentions are good. However, under the current system, the procedures are cumbersome and time-consuming, and merchants are very inconvenient. For example, pigments have become rare goods in the world market today, and orders must be quick to not miss the opportunity. However, if a request for approval telegram comes from abroad today, it will take two weeks for Chinese importers to go through the application procedures, and the goods have already been ordered by others. Recently, the import and export industry has been collectively striving to simplify the application procedures. According to the industry's observations, as more and more remaining materials are shipped, the allocation of materials to importers will become a reality when the import quota is finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Although Manufacturers Have Allocated Goods, Rayon Prices Still Rise; Completely Affected by Gold Notes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Although yesterday rayon manufacturers allocated goods for sale, the price of gold notes rose again, causing public excitement. Therefore, the market rose slightly again yesterday. The price of "150" brand bright rayon was the highest, with "Tian Ju" brand bright rayon even asking for 4.5 million yuan. Generic brands also required 400,000 yuan to be supplied. However, transactions were very scarce. Factory-direct warp yarn also showed a slight increase in sales yesterday. O-grade goods were traded at 4,525,000 yuan. Goods below E-grade were unavailable. Spot goods were offered at 4.1 million yuan. Dried warp yarn also rose yesterday. Within 30 counts, five bundles of goods were opened at 3.28 million yuan, and another bundle was offered at 3.15 million yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Silk fabrics were unremarkable, and transactions were very few. The production area of Hangzhou goods has already reported price increases, but there is no outlet in the Shanghai market, and prices remain unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Market Flooded with Goods for Auction, Yarn Market Shows No Improvement <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish and weak. Although gold notes soared to new heights, yarn prices still showed no improvement. The market was flooded with 20-count yarn for auction, and because there were no tax invoices, the selling price was particularly low. At the same time, customer demand was limited, and the market in other cities was weak. Therefore, the price of yarn did not rise slightly due to the high price of gold, which is a rare and welcome phenomenon in recent times.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Tinplate Prices Soar <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Tinplate is used in the manufacture of oil cans and canned goods, and the demand is very large. In the early post-war period, a considerable amount of goods arrived. Later, due to the lack of emphasis on the use of tinplate abroad, the products also decreased. Several months ago, exports were once banned, causing panic in the city and prices to rise step by step. Although the ban was later relaxed, the arrival of 26-gauge and 24-gauge large tinplate was still rare, resulting in stable prices in the city that have not fallen. Recently, the overseas pricing has increased, and the trend is upward again. The price of 26-gauge has increased by 500,000 yuan per , and the price of 24-gauge has increased by 1 million yuan per box. However, there are still many inventories of double-width tinplate, and the price is stable.</p>

<p>A total of more than 13,000 piculs of rice arrived from both the north and south. The weather was clear, and public sentiment turned lax. Southern japonica rice fell by 3,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by 2,000 yuan. Indica rice followed with a decrease of over 1,000 yuan. "Bai Yuan" rice fell by 3,000 yuan, and "Yin Yuan" rice also fell by 2-3,000 yuan. The trend has stopped rising and turned to falling. The arrival of oil on the market was abundant, and all oils fell one after another after opening. Raw oil and sesame oil both fell by 3-5,000 yuan, soybean oil also squeezed down by 2-3,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and clear oil both fell by 3-4,000 yuan. The soybean market softened, and prices fell by 3-500 yuan across the board. The arrival and sale of red sorghum were both scarce, and there was no basis for movement for the time being. Broad beans followed the downstream of various goods, seeing a small decrease of 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were stable due to the shortage of goods. Raw peanuts from the Guangdong region fluctuated, tight at first and then weak, resulting in no gains or losses. In the soybean cake trade, Shantou was lively, and Taiwan saw a slight increase of 2-300 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were like being on a battlefield, rising and falling sharply. The major yarn and cotton dealers attacked from the east and west, and the fluctuations were very large. The opening prices of all stocks in the morning were already high. After No. 38 and No. 177 offered to sell at high prices, they immediately fell. No. 154 and others came in, and the off-market appetite was particularly strong, pulling the prices back to the opening prices.

The price of Yongxin Yarn fell to 575 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the wind turned around, it immediately soared. There was no transaction to be made in the section from 580 yuan to 600 yuan. No. 152, No. 226, No. 89, No. 36, No. 76, and No. 232 continued to buy. The off-market price was extremely high, forming a situation of demand exceeding supply. The surface was extremely narrow, buying orders were unprecedented, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. Near noon, the price rose by more than 70 yuan. After No. 145 and others sold off, the price rebounded slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongxin Yarn and Xinli rose by about 10%.

Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and there were transactions on the black market with an increase of 5 to 10 yuan. Xinyuan was also approaching the price limit. After No. 215, No. 76, No. 145, No. 207, and No. 88 came to sell, it began to fall back by more than 20 yuan. However, No. 218, No. 89, No. 28, No. 133, and others rushed to cover their positions. After that, it was announced that the price limit had been hit twice. No. 160, No. 102, No. 61, No. 89, No. 185, and No. 83 all sold, and it still fell back.

<h3 id="e157">Special Institutionalization in Taiwan: A Cross-Section of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Taipei, 4th (Airmail) Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this newspaper</p>
<p>Taiwan, called the "vacuum zone" of the economy, still retains its original special posture more than a year after its restoration. In the past, the phenomenon was: the Bank of Taiwan refused the establishment of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks. When the legal tender and customs gold, which were circulating throughout the country, arrived at the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung, they became like waste paper; otherwise, they would be swallowed by middlemen and banks for a third or two of the exchange rate. Merchants paid the national unified tax domestically, but their cargo was most easily confiscated by the Monopoly Bureau and the Police Bureau. They either said that this was an order from the executive authority, or that it conflicted with the province's monopoly policy. As for what happened to the confiscated goods, it is easy to cause problems.</p>
<p>This state of blockage caused by the isolation from the domestic economy fully illustrates the special style performed by the local authorities in this province due to their special views. This style has been criticized and attacked by all parties, but until now, except for the Monopoly Bureau which has been revised, no clues of reform have been discovered. The chief loves to obtain Taiwan, and he insists on developing national capital and the principle of people's livelihood, moving them to the entire island as an experiment. However, the difficult problems in reality have completely hindered the economic ideals he wants to practice.</p>
<p>Monopoly Bureau: Large Organization</p>
<p>Revenue from Five Monopoly Items Exceeds 700 Million</p>
<p>As a large organization in Taiwan Province, the Monopoly Bureau has a headquarters in Taipei, which is divided into eleven sections and offices, eleven branch offices in the province, two offices, two cigarette factories, two camphor factories, thirteen wineries, two match factories, as well as the Fanzi Field Factory, the Metrology Institute, the Tobacco Testing Institute, and 41 units that have been received and are related to the business, such as beer, refined camphor, camphor oil, printing, wine bottles, and glucose companies. Not only are these units unclear to the general public, but the bureau itself has not been able to fully understand them.</p>
<p>Director Ren Weijun took over the entire bureau on November 1 last year. Originally, two-thirds of the factories were shut down, but most of them resumed work within ten days. Now there are more than 6,500 employees, distributed in various units, working for the manufacture and sale of monopoly goods.</p>
<p>The value of the bureau's assets received, calculated at Taiwan dollar purchase prices, is 20,194,041 ares of land, equivalent to 8,118,550 yuan; machinery worth 8,308,097 yuan; buildings totaling 4,869 ares, equivalent to 16,972,719 yuan; raw materials worth 16,239,741 yuan; materials worth 2,786,370 yuan; other materials totaling 3,192,118 yuan; manufacturing equipment worth 1,598,404 yuan; and transportation equipment worth 344,221 yuan. Finished and semi-finished products are excluded.</p>
<p>During the Japanese era, the highest revenue from eight monopoly items (salt, camphor, opium, tobacco, wine, gasoline, weights and measures, matches) accounted for more than 49% of the total revenue of the province, and the revenue in 1940 exceeded 100 million Japanese yen. After the takeover, opium was explicitly abolished, gasoline was no longer necessary to be monopolized, and table salt was handed over to the Salt Administration Bureau on April 1 of this year. Therefore, the current monopoly items are mainly camphor, tobacco, wine (including rice wine, beer), matches, and weights and measures. According to the bureau's estimate, the revenue for this year is more than 700 million Taiwan dollars, accounting for more than 32% of the total revenue of the province.</p>
<p>Benefits Lower Than Unified Tax</p>
<p>Old Policies Are Ready to Be Completely Changed</p>
<p>Director Ren told reporters that it is unreasonable for democratic countries to have a monopoly system. When China's wartime monopoly system was established, he served as a member of the Chongqing Monopoly Design Committee. From 1940 to 1941, he served as the director of the Monopoly Bureau in Hunan. Later, it was abolished due to normal tax revenue, lack of raw materials, and the tense war situation. At that time, he was serving as a member of the examination committee for the Ministry of Finance's monopoly. He explained that the difficulties he currently feels are (1) high labor costs, (2) lack of raw materials, and (3) transportation difficulties. In addition, the continuous influx of private goods from the mainland has affected revenue. However, according to the actual situation, what are the achievements of this isolationist policy? It is obvious that because the products of each factory are freely produced only based on production capacity and raw material conditions, the selling price is high, the quality is poor, and mountains of cigarettes are unsalable. The cost of beer is 20 Taiwan dollars, but it is retailed for 70 yuan, exceeding the price of Shanghai Yihua Beer. American-made camphor has taken away the market for 80% of Taiwan's camphor production, and because of the huge organization, poor management, and inadequate supervision, cost accounting cannot be reported, and it is easier for corrupt elements to gather and seek profits. On August 2, Chen Jidi, the director of the Chiayi branch, committed suicide due to poverty. It has been investigated and found that he embezzled 600,000 yuan of monopoly goods and committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The newly appointed director of the branch, Zhou Bizhang, and Liu Chicao, the director of the Nanmen factory, have recently been detained for corruption, as well as several other cases, which are sufficient to illustrate the failure of the personnel supervision system to be perfected.</p>
<p>The monopoly system, a product of inheriting the financial policies of the colony, is currently obviously focused on revenue. Director Ren said that from November last year to the end of June this year, the number of treasury deposits was 206 million yuan, and the total value of inventory materials, finished products, and accounts receivable was still more than 670 million yuan. There was no loss, and there was still a surplus. Since July, the operating income of various places has doubled compared to June, and there have been profits in July and August. However, according to the opinion of the strict finance department, the number that can be paid to the treasury is much less than the original budget. Monopoly and unified tax are different. The former's benefits are higher than the latter. If the benefits are the same or lower, the method must be completely re-examined. In fact, since July, the Monopoly Bureau has designated various branches to adopt a contracted system, except for the number stipulated to be paid to the bureau, its administrative expenses are paid from the excess number; otherwise, salaries may not be paid. This kind of malpractice of the modern financial system has been exemplified.</p>
<p>The chief himself said that he is very anxious about the monopoly revenue, because neither the central government nor the provinces have this system, so many disputes and criticisms have arisen. He further explained that the cigarettes and wine he saw along the way during his southern tour were not from the Monopoly Bureau. In the past, when Japan occupied the mainland, it also implemented a monopoly, so it works in Taiwan. He bluntly said: "In principle, I advocate monopoly. If it doesn't work, it may be simpler to levy a unified tax and improve the products, which may increase revenue. This is a policy issue, and even if we want to change the method, we must have preparation time." The authorities have revealed a consideration of the existence or abolition of the monopoly, which has no future.</p>
<p>Trade Bureau Denies Control</p>
<p>Main Business: Import, Export, and Distribution</p>
<p>Another financial focus in Taiwan Province is placed on the Trade Bureau, which is also a product of Taiwan's special circumstances. They first took over the "Taiwan Important Materials Group," the highest form of Japanese strengthening control of Taiwan's trade. After 200,000 Japanese troops were repatriated, they began to take over the assets of Mitsui, Mitsubishi's Taiwan branch, and their affiliated institutions. Originally, it used the name of a company, but because it could not follow the company law in law, it was changed to the current bureau on February 1.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the Trade Bureau's business is mainly import, export, and distribution. Director Yu Baixi especially explained to reporters that they took over the Japanese control institutions, but did not take over the Japanese control policies. The only administrative control item they handle is the prohibition of private sugar smuggling. The reason for taking such measures is (1) Taiwan Province suffered great losses during the war, and grasping material exchange can be used for reconstruction. (2) The price of sugar outside the province is about ten times higher than that in the province, and a small number of adventurous merchants cannot be allowed to earn huge profits. (3) If the only sugar left in the province is exchanged with luxury goods and unnecessary goods outside the province, it will inevitably disperse the strength. On August 5, this ban was also lifted. Now only food is allowed to circulate within eight regions in the province, but export is still prohibited. He said that now it is 100% business, and not control at all. He continued to state that the position of the Trade Bureau is equal to that of merchants. It concentrates manpower and material resources to purchase and export materials for various units, avoid waste, and adjust surpluses and deficiencies according to the urgency and importance. If merchants entrust it, it is happy to accept.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the bureau's business center has been (1) exporting materials such as 7,017 tons of sugar, 20,916 tons of coal, 316 tons of camphor, 485 boxes of tea, 417 boxes of wood, and 1,000 boxes of oranges, which cannot be compared with the annual surplus of 200 million Taiwan dollars in the heyday before the war. (2) Importing materials mainly include 100,000 bolts of cloth, 90,900 bags of flour, 7,256 tons of fertilizer, 3,029 tons of soybean cake, 2,532 tons of peanut cake, and other rapeseed cake, etc. (3) Distributing 90,900 bags of flour to remedy the food shortage, 100,000 bolts of cloth, and contracting 52 dealers in the province to distribute rubber products and calcium carbide, etc. Offices have been set up in Keelung, Kaohsiung, and Taichung in the province. Outside the province, in addition to Shanghai, offices are being prepared to be established in Hong Kong, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dalian, Fuzhou, Tokyo, etc. The distribution mechanism in the province is also being prepared to be completed recently. The value of materials that can be exported in these six months is 70 million Taiwan dollars, and the value of imported materials such as fertilizer, cloth, and machinery is 20 million Taiwan dollars, which can obtain a net profit of more than 270 million yuan.</p>
<p>Two Kinds of People Oppose the Trade Bureau</p>
<p>Seizing Monopoly Interests by Cutting Off Commodities</p>
<p>Director Yu further explained that there are two kinds of people who are trying their best to oppose the Trade Bureau. One is those who are limited by traditional political relations and intentionally oppose it, which cannot be explained. The other is merchants with vested interests, such as Dagong Enterprise Company, which uses capital from Taiwan Province, and merchants from Min, Wen, and Shanghai in the mainland. After the restoration, they focused on fertilizer. As a result, chemical fertilizers were shipped from Shanghai at 400,000 yuan per ton, but they were sold at a price of 180,000 yuan in legal tender. This loss-making business was because they did not understand the actual situation in the province. In the past, the 500,000 tons of fertilizer needed annually were subject to strict control and quantitative distribution. They sold the fertilizer at a low price, attempting to make up for the loss through food, which was frustrated. As a result, it aroused the opposition of this group of people. He concluded with the following words: "The Trade Bureau is not a profit-oriented organization, but a business organization that adjusts people's livelihood and engages in construction! As of June, the amount paid to the treasury was 100 million yuan."</p>
<p>On the other side of his explanation, people have seen the recent prospects of the merchant style. The Trade Bureau aims to make profits by raising sugar prices, and the achievements of this painful strategy are limited. It cuts off commodity trade and seizes monopoly interests in domestic and foreign transactions. In the first provincial assembly meeting, a councilor said: The reason why officials and people are separated now is mostly due to the Trade Bureau. The central government has ordered the abolition of the trade law, which is really inappropriate to use in this province and must be abolished. Obviously, under the monopoly where merchants should not profit, this all-inclusive and specialized trade system has caused dissatisfaction among people inside and outside the province. People are all recalling the trade companies of various provinces during the war. The economic model of feudal separatism has deepened the barriers between provinces and caused the economy itself to shrink. However, Chief Chen Yi did not want a small number of merchants to obtain huge profits, and attempted to use the Trade Bureau to purchase and sell in a unified manner, so that the government could make money and use it for the people. He firmly believed that this was the economic theory instructed by President Sun Yat-sen! (August)</p>

<h3 id="e158">Indian Contemporary Sage Aurobindo <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Delhi Air Dispatch, Our Correspondent in India, Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>Aurobindo, may my reverence and worship reach you!</p>
<p>Today I see your body, filled with wisdom;</p>
<p>If I see it on another day, I will not have praised you enough!</p>
<p>Aurobindo, may my reverence and worship reach you! — Tagore</p>
<p>On the shores of the Indian Ocean, in the French territory of Pondicherry, resides the contemporary sage Sri Aurobindo. He has lived here for over thirty years, and for the past fifteen years, he has remained silent, except when discussing matters of philosophy with the Mother, Melar. His purpose is to transform all living beings into divinity and guide them to enlightenment. Scholars from all over the world travel great distances to have the honor of meeting him. Thousands of people visit each year, but only a few people in our country know of him. Is this due to the obstruction of the towering Mount Sumeru? Although, many in our country know of Gandhi, Tagore, Jinnah, and Nehru, it is regrettable that few know of Aurobindo, the leader of the Hindu religion worshiped by these three hundred million Indians. The writer traveled to Pondicherry to visit Aurobindo and returned with deep emotions. November 24th marks the 35th anniversary of Aurobindo's renunciation of the world and pursuit of spiritual practice. I will use this occasion to recount his life and introduce him to the people of our country, and express my admiration.</p>
<p>The Venerable Old Man with an Imposing Demeanor</p>
<p>Aurobindo is 74 years old this year, with white hair and a youthful complexion, and an imposing demeanor that inspires awe. He was born on August 15, 1872, in Calcutta. His father, Krishna Nath Ghose, was a famous educator in Bengal, but he wanted his children to receive a complete English-style education. Therefore, when Aurobindo was five years old, he sent him to St. Paul's English School in Darjeeling. At the age of seven, he sent him and his two brothers to England to study at a private English school. At the age of thirteen, he entered St. Paul's School in London. Five years later, he entered King's College, Cambridge University, and received scholarships for Greek and Latin. After graduating, he passed all the written examinations for the Indian Civil Service Examination with top marks. However, he did not want to work in administration, and in the final equestrian test, he did not participate, so he could not obtain formal qualifications. If Aurobindo had been willing to work in administration, his position in society today would have been no less than that of a High Court judge or a provincial governor. Later, Aurobindo met the Prince of Baroda State in England, and at his request, he returned to India in 1893 to work in the state treasury, while also serving as the vice-principal of the State College. Before his return to India, his father passed away, and he was unable to see him one last time, which he regretted.</p>
<p>Long Residence in England, Proficient in Foreign Languages</p>
<p>Aurobindo lived in England for many years and was deeply influenced by Western civilization. He was a scholar of Greek and Latin and was proficient in French, German, and Italian literature. He was particularly proficient in Dante's Divine Comedy and Goethe's Faust. He was also highly proficient in Sanskrit, Pali, and Bengali. He translated the Sanskrit work "Vikrama-Urvasi" ("The Hero and the Nymph") by the ancient Indian poet Kalidas. Several volumes of Aurobindo's poems and essays have been published. At the same time, he began to practice yoga, making rapid progress. His poems and essays are superb and ethereal, and his recently published collection of poems and essays is a rare work in the literary world. He married Miss Milly at this time, but Aurobindo did not enjoy the pleasures of marital life. He often said to his attendants: "We should take lofty thoughts and ordinary life as the main purpose of establishing a family." Until 1906, Aurobindo left Baroda State and returned to Calcutta, despite the earnest attempts of the Prince to retain him. At this time, Aurobindo began to engage in practical political activities. He first served as the principal of the Bengal National College. The British dismissed him because of his association with the anti-British affairs of the "Motherland Daily." He was later reinstated until he was arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Once Formed a Party and Became its Leader</p>
<p>As the chief writer of the "Motherland Daily," Aurobindo's arguments were very different from those of his contemporaries. At that time, most people in India advocated a self-governing government within the British Empire, but Aurobindo advocated an absolutely free and independent country. He also regarded the awakening of the national spirit as the most important thing. Aurobindo organized the Nationalist Party and became its leader. In 1907, he presided over the All-India Nationalist Conference in Surat, which suddenly awakened Indian politics. At that time, the poet Tagore was traveling in Europe and made a special trip to Pondicherry to visit Aurobindo, saying: "We are waiting for your perfect voice to spread, and the motherland will awaken in your fame." Later, Aurobindo's younger brother, Birendra Ghosh, organized a revolutionary group. The British government suspected that Aurobindo was planning from behind the scenes and arrested him in May 1908. He was released from prison in May of the following year. During his one-year imprisonment, he devoted himself to yoga and attained enlightenment. After being released from prison, he saw that his comrades in the party were scattered and felt that the essence of the political movement was nothing more than a manifestation of a religious revival movement. Therefore, in February 1910, he set sail from Calcutta to Pondicherry to continue his secluded practice, in order to realize his great ambition of transforming mankind from the ordinary to the sacred. At that time, the Indian National Congress still hoped that Aurobindo would come out of seclusion and participate in the political movement, and offered him the position of chairman, but he politely declined. Finally, Mr. Chitaranjan Das of the Congress Party visited Aurobindo and urged him to come out of seclusion. Aurobindo replied: "Chittaranjan, I will no longer participate in the affairs of the human world with my original thoughts and inspiration. I am pursuing the highest goal. If my ambition can be realized, then I will use this as a foundation for the beginning of my new career." As far as I can see, what is the purpose of Aurobindo's words? His monthly magazine "Arya" can explain its meaning. This monthly magazine was published in 1914, just after Aurobindo had spent four years in seclusion.</p>
<p>Writings Throughout His Life Numbering Hundreds</p>
<p>Aurobindo's writings throughout his life number hundreds of volumes. The most important of these are the two great works, "The Life Divine" and "Essays on the Gita," both of which contain more than two million words. All his arguments are to expound on the spirit and wisdom, as well as yoga arguments. The rest of the articles include ancient Indian culture and civilization, the true meaning of the Vedas, the evolution of the human race, the creation and style of poetry, and the purpose of universal harmony. The monthly magazine "Arya" was discontinued in 1921. The magazine that has succeeded it is the "Advent," which is compiled by his disciples and aims at Aurobindo's philosophy. It is published by the Sri Aurobindo Library in Madras, India. There are also the "Aurobindo Annual Report" and "Quarterly," which are published by the Aurobindo Philosophical Society in Calcutta and Bombay. Their purpose is the same as that of "Advent." Soon after Aurobindo settled in Pondicherry, the Mother, Mear, arrived in India from Japan and visited Aurobindo. The Mother is French and is 69 years old this year, but she looks like she is in her thirties. She had a wish to practice spiritual practice since she was young. When she grew up,</p>
<p>Recent Photograph of Aurobindo (Sent by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India) She devoted herself to visiting and learning about the Tao. Her footprints have spread throughout Europe and Asia. She has profound attainments in Eastern and Western philosophy. Judging from the various books she has written, she has indeed attained enlightenment. Today, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram is presided over by her.</p>
<p>The Philosophy of "The Life Divine" is Profound</p>
<p>The Aurobindo Ashram is located in the east of Pondicherry, facing the Indian Ocean. There are more than one hundred buildings in the ashram, with beautiful scenery, fragrant flowers and birds, and lush bamboo forests. It is indeed a sacred place for spiritual practice. There are more than 400 monks and nuns in the ashram, all of whom are contemporary Indian artists, musicians, poets, writers, engineers, and doctors. They devote their entire lives to following Aurobindo's spiritual practice in order to realize Aurobindo's "Month of the Divine Life."</p>
<p>Aurobindo's advocated "The Life Divine" is different from ancient Indian yoga. When people engage in yoga, once they succeed, their mind and body will inevitably separate and leave. The Buddhist concept of entering Nirvana means this. However, Aurobindo's philosophy of the Divine Life splits into two paths and returns to the same destination: one is ascent, and the other is descent. Ascent refers to the process from enlightenment to complete enlightenment, which is what the Buddha called attaining Bodhi and the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom. Descent refers to the process after attaining Bodhi, where one descends their wisdom and not only enters into the spirit, but also penetrates into the body, so that this body is transformed into divinity. From this, we can know that Aurobindo's philosophy requires people to create benefits for mankind in the human world after attaining enlightenment, and not for their own personal gain. It is broad and profound, and it develops what predecessors have not developed. No wonder the French writer Romain Rolland praised it: "Mr. Aurobindo brings together Eastern and Western philosophy into one body and melts the essence into one furnace!" The truth of the ancient Chinese immortals' "Three-Phase Coordination and Understanding of Reality" is quite similar to Aurobindo's philosophy. Unfortunately, our language and writing are not yet resolved, so we cannot verify each other. The Buddha said that there is only one truth in the world, then Aurobindo's philosophy is the same as the philosophy of our Chinese immortals. The manifestation of the truth is waiting for someone with a heart to do it.</p>
<p>China and India are as closely related as lips and teeth, and their cultural exchanges have lasted for two thousand years. During this awe-inspiring period of exchanges, no wars have occurred, which is regarded as a beautiful story by historians. Moreover, our country's culture has been deeply influenced by Buddhist thought, and the revival of Neo-Confucianism in the Song and Ming dynasties is one example. In the future, if we want to promote academic and cultural exchanges between China and India, as well as the friendship between the two nations, we must study the spirit of India's nation-building. Aurobindo's philosophy can be said to represent this trend. In the future, if we want to lay a foundation stone for world peace, we must devote ourselves to Aurobindo's philosophy. November 24th is the 36th anniversary of Aurobindo's renunciation of the world and pursuit of spiritual practice. The signatory is unable to go to worship the master due to official duties, so I will translate a verse from the "Rigveda" to wish him from afar:</p>
<p>"Arise, O Spirit!</p>
<p>Strive forward!</p>
<p>The night has passed,</p>
<p>The dawn appears!"</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Blocking of the Yellow River Estuary: Can the Night Work Be Completed by January Next Year? Will Undergo a Second Test of "Time" <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou Air Dispatch, Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Time is very ruthless. If you ask it to be a witness, it will tell the truth without any politeness. The Yellow River Huayuankou blocking project was supposed to be completed before July 1st of this year, but if you ask time to be a witness, it will just say "no" and be done with it. Now it is preparing to testify for the second time on February 1st next year. This makes us wonder, will it still say "no" at that time, or will it change its mind and say "yes"?</p>
<p>There are always many reasons for the failure of a thing. There are many reasons for the first failure to block Huayuankou: everything is always connected with politics, so when we talk about the Huayuankou blocking project, we cannot avoid talking about the CCP issue. The lower reaches of the ancient Yellow River channel, more than a hundred miles downstream of Huayuankou, are almost entirely in the hands of the CCP. The purpose of blocking the estuary is to divert water into the ancient channel, so dredging the ancient channel and blocking the Huayuankou estuary are one and the same thing. Therefore, in March, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission sent a surveying team to the lower reaches to survey and estimate the earthwork for the restoration of the ancient channel embankment, but as soon as they arrived in Kaocheng, they were blocked by the Communist army. As a result, the development of the Huayuankou blocking project on this side was delayed. In April, two rock drilling machines of the Lvwangxiang blocking bureau near Xinxiang were smashed to pieces by the Communist army, and several people were also captured at that time, which also affected part of the project. When stones were thrown in May, the CCP saw that the project was about to be completed, so it sent people to Huayuankou to make trouble and raised serious "protests." As a result, it was agreed that only two meters of stones would be thrown first, which of course delayed this part of the project again. Secondly, the issue of willow branches and workers is really embarrassing for us Chinese. The rock drilling machines, pile drivers, cranes, wooden stakes, cement, flour, and even wooden boats needed for the project were all shipped from the United States by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) on schedule. We only needed to supply some willow branches and workers. The Chinese countryside is indeed poor enough, and willow branches have also become valuable. It is said that at that time, one cart of willow branches would cost about 40,000 yuan. Even if the local area had these willow branches and the people could afford to lose money, there would not be enough means of transportation to transport them. For example, the willow branches that Zhongmu County should send would take a year and a half to transport even if all the county's ox carts and small carts were mobilized. The willow branches became a problem, and the project sometimes had to stare blankly and could not proceed. Workers were supposed to be hired, but somehow they became conscripted workers. At the same time, because the treatment was too poor, some workers ran away and some escaped, which also hindered the progress of the project. As for the engineering aspects, we are laymen and dare not say anything. We only heard them say that a certain consultant should not have insisted on driving the piles in, and why did they saw them off when they could not drive them in? It was also not okay to insist on throwing stones down. There were many such words, which shows that there were also problems in the engineering.</p>
<p>The reason why these past events are written down is to explain that the water situation has won the time on the project. In mid-June, the upper reaches of the Yellow River rose sharply, and the flow rate reached 17,000 cubic meters per second, and it was difficult to continue the Huayuankou blocking project at a flow rate of more than 4,000 cubic meters per second. Therefore, one-third of the large wooden piles that had just been driven were washed away all at once, and the failure was announced.</p>
<p>Zhao Shouyu, the chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, resigned from his concurrent position as the director of the blocking and restoration bureau, and was replaced by Zhu Guangcai, a water conservancy expert. After Zhu arrived, the 8-meter-deep gap at the washed-away wooden pile suddenly became 18 meters deep due to the water erosion. It was impossible to drive in wooden piles, and it was even more impossible to speed up the throwing of stones, otherwise the water would erode deeper and deeper, and the flow would become more and more rapid. This seemed to be deliberately posing a difficult problem for the new director. According to Director Zhu, it is more difficult to improve this situation than to start over, because the deepest water level at the beginning was only 8 meters, but now it has reached 18 meters. At the same time, the water is concentrated in this deep place and flows turbulently and rapidly, so it is absolutely impossible to block it by force. Therefore, his method is to silt up the deep place and to divert the water evenly, at least diverting a part of the flow to the side. For this reason, it is first necessary to make the water level average high, so that the water in the rapid place will slow down, and the slow flow will become silt, and the deep place will also be silted up. Director Zhu's method of raising the water level at the mouth is to build a new bridge 350 meters behind the blocking estuary, where the water level is only 4 meters deep. This new bridge can not only raise the water level at the mouth, but also serve as the second line of defense for the blocking project. That is, if there is no way to repair the piles and throw stones on the old bridge, then another stove can be built on the new bridge to block the estuary. After this new bridge was built, there was a lot of opposition from the outside, thinking that this was a waste, and thinking that the old bridge project was so large that it was not enough to block it, so could the new bridge still help? Now the effect of this new bridge has already been seen. The place where the water was rapid has slowed down, and the 18-meter water depth at the bottom has been reduced to 13 meters. At the same time, it should be noted here that the reason why the water situation can be changed is that throwing willow bundles in front of the old bridge has a side effect. Those willow bundles are always two or three feet long, with large stones inside, and two or three hundred people pile them bundle by bundle into the water. The wooden piles can be repaired in two or three days, and then the throwing of stones will continue.</p>
<p>What the blocking and restoration bureau is now worried about is not the issue of willow branches, because this difficulty has been alleviated since the method of self-purchase and self-transportation was changed. It is also not the issue of workers, because now only more than 10,000 workers are needed, and their treatment has also been improved. The most problematic thing now is the stone material. The Railway Bureau can only transport one trainload of stone material per day, and they hope to be able to transport five or six trainloads. The blocking and restoration bureau believes that stone material is equivalent to ammunition for war, and without enough stone material, they have no way to fight.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the lower reaches and the CCP, this is the 150 million yuan relocation fee for the residents on the riverbed, which has been decided to be issued, but the technical aspects are being studied on how to issue it. Chairman Zhao of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and American consultant Tadd decided to go to Shandong with CCP representative Zhao Mingfu in the near future to investigate the downstream embankment restoration project. The progress of the project, the extent of the progress, and how the funds will be handled in the future will all be revealed in the next episode.</p>
<p>This time, the Yellow River Huayuankou is determined to be completed before the end of January next year, otherwise, when the freezing period arrives, ice blocks will come like mountains and seas, and the partially completed project will not be able to withstand the impact of the ice blocks. At that time, not only will the project suffer, but the new dikes in the flooded area will probably be difficult to protect. The disaster will not only affect eastern Henan, but northern Anhui will also be submerged. This depends on how time will testify for the second time for the blocking of the estuary.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The World Art Center: Stepping into the Studio of Female Professor Pan Yuliang <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Air Dispatch from the 4th, Special Correspondent in Paris, Wang Ren</p>
<p>Able to use the brush to create magic, light or heavy makeup as desired, literary fortune has opened a new record, and a famous teacher is seen in the art world.</p>
<p>This is what I wrote after visiting the studio of Professor Pan Yuliang at the Scientific and Cultural Congress in Paris. Paris is the center of world art. The residences of artists in the 14th arrondissement are always built with studios. Most of them are full of reality and face north to get light that is suitable for painting. Also, the rooms are taller than ordinary residences. All studios should be located on the top floor.</p>
<p>Because sunlight shining on paper or cloth changes the colors, it is difficult to see accurately. Facing south has too much sunlight, which is absolutely not suitable for drawing. The east and west sides are exposed to sunlight in the morning and evening, which is also not very suitable for painting. Professor Pan Yuliang, a female professor at Central University who won the Rome Prize in her early years and stayed in France and then Italy, also has a studio facing north, in a long alley in the 14th arrondissement, in front of a two-story building in a hidden courtyard. The old house has a high gate, which is full of secluded interest. There is a key on the door, and it opens when pressed. Inside is a large courtyard, and it is not easy for outsiders to know it. Knocking on the door at dusk is like guessing a riddle, and it takes a long time to find it.</p>
<p>On a Sunday in late November 1946, I accepted a letter of invitation and made a special trip to enjoy tea. The guests were all famous figures in the art world, including the strongest among the twelve people who stayed in France, and Professor Pan was no less than a leader among them. Pan's residence is divided into two rooms, the outer room near the door is the studio. The three characters "Pan Yuliang" are signed next to the door, and the names of the visitors who have visited are inscribed vertically and horizontally on the left and right sides of the famous name, like the empty corridor of the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in West Lake. The original colors of the celebrities can be imagined as soon as they arrive at the door.</p>
<p>Pan has been away from the country for nearly eight years, and she is concerned about people's livelihood and talks freely about national affairs. She said that Chinese celebrities are not only not good at enjoying themselves, but also not good at showing off. If she herself is engaged in painting, if she is shocked by the beautiful name of "world-class", and if she thinks about other national athletes racing to show off, she will definitely not have the chance to win. Those who heard it all agreed that she knew what she was talking about. After talking for a long time, she excused herself and walked north from there. The avenues she passed along the way were brightly lit, and the joy of the night was very evident. Compared with the dynamic state in front of the lights in Paris, the silver candles of the Ghost Festival on the 30th of the seventh lunar month of the Chinese old calendar and the bright moonlight on the ground when young women walked to the moon on the 15th night of the eighth lunar month, are like a small wizard seeing a great wizard, and they cannot be mentioned on the same day.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Taipei Observes the Lunar Eclipse <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Taipei Airmail Report, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>It was the full moon day of the eleventh lunar month. Before 5 PM, the sky was filled with clouds, carrying a heavy feeling of rain. However, after 5 PM, the weather became exceptionally clear. The lunar eclipse observation reception, scheduled to be held tonight at Taipei Zhongshan Hall by the Taipei Astronomical Society, was expected to proceed smoothly. Indeed, Heaven was truly helping. After I finished dinner, a crystal clear full moon was already hanging radiantly above the mountains in front of my window.</p>
<p>Arriving at Zhongshan Hall, it was already crowded with visitors. A white cloth for signatures was completely filled. Inside the venue, staff from the Taipei Weather Bureau were explaining astronomical knowledge to the visitors: A solar eclipse is a phenomenon caused by the moon moving between the Earth and the sun. Because the moon is small, not everyone on Earth can see it. A lunar eclipse is a phenomenon caused by the Earth blocking the moon and the sun, which is visible in many places. Then, they gave a simple explanation of "Taiwan Time": Taiwan's longitude is 120 degrees east, which is within the Central Plains time zone. The time here is the same as in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other places. Every 15 degrees of longitude marks a new time zone, resulting in a one-hour difference. For example, Chongqing is at 105 degrees east longitude, so its time is one hour behind Taiwan, Shanghai, and other places.</p>
<p>Taiwan vs. Hong Kong: Which is Accurate?</p>
<p>These were very basic but interesting astronomical facts, which were absorbed by everyone present. In fact, this is a most practical form of social education. Judging from the enthusiasm of the attendees, one can see that this work has been quite effective, although the formation of this trend did not start today.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspaper carried a report from the Hong Kong Observatory stating that the lunar eclipse on the morning of the 9th of this month, from the initial eclipse to full recovery, would take six hours, longer than the lunar eclipse of June 15th this year, and it also provided a detailed prediction of the time of the lunar eclipse. However, according to Section Chief Wang of the Astronomical Measurement Section of the Taipei Weather Bureau, who told reporters at the venue that, based on the time of 120 degrees east longitude, they measured the time of the lunar eclipse as follows: Initial eclipse at 0:10:11.8 AM on the 9th, total eclipse begins at 1:18:41.2 AM, maximum eclipse at 1:47:53 AM, emergence at 2:17:04.8 AM, full recovery at 3:25:34.2 AM. The total duration from the initial eclipse to full recovery is 3 hours, 15 minutes, and 23 seconds, which is 34 minutes and 13 seconds shorter than the first total lunar eclipse on June 15th of this year. Therefore, he suspected that the report from Hong Kong might be incorrect. Fortunately, this mystery will soon be revealed, the reporter thought to himself.</p>
<p>After the explanation of astronomical knowledge, there was still a long time before the actual observation of the lunar eclipse. The Weather Bureau was very thoughtful and specially borrowed a colorful war documentary film "Female Warrior" from the United States Information Service to show to the attendees, in order to pass the time.</p>
<p>Accurate to the Second</p>
<p>On the balcony outside the cliff, a four-and-a-half-inch refracting telescope and another mirror were set up. Many people were willing to lie on the cement floor and keep their eyes glued to them, unwilling to leave.</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute, gradually approaching the last program of the day. The night was deep and the wind was strong, but everyone standing on the balcony did not feel cold, only a sense of interesting tension. The 8th passed by, and around 0:00 AM on the 9th, after the explanation of the staff, everyone quietly looked towards the sky. The eastern edge of the moon gradually entered the dark area, its color was dim yellow, like swirling smoke. At 0:10:12 AM, the Earth's shadow kissed the edge of the moon and ruthlessly engulfed its face. At this time, the luminosity gradually decreased. Then at 1:18:42 AM, the moon was finally completely swallowed by the Earth's shadow, and the Earth was as dark as the new moon. But in the darkness, there seemed to be some faint light inside the moon. Looking through the telescope, the periphery of the moon was light blue with green, the inner layer was rose and copper-colored, and the innermost layer was dark red. This is said to be atmospheric refraction caused by sunlight passing through the Earth's surface air. Seeing this, I couldn't help but recall the comical scene of following people in the countryside to bang on basins and small gongs as a child. The moon gradually shone brighter, but for decades, many people still said it was scared out by the sound of the gongs.</p>
<p>The results of the observation were very consistent with the time calculated by the observatory using complex formulas. Although the telescope could not be perfectly accurate in practice, the difference would not exceed five seconds. This proved that the report from Hong Kong was completely wrong.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Germany: All Sorts of Things in the Red Zone <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yan An, Translated from This Week Magazine</p>
<p>When I told my landlady in Berlin that I was going to the "enemy zone" (her term for the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany), she looked very uneasy. "Poor thing!" she said. "You will encounter the most terrible experiences."</p>
<p>Our trip behind the "Iron Curtain" was arranged in advance with the Soviet liaison officer. Our group—myself and two friends—were free to visit any places we liked. We requested that there be no Soviet personnel present to monitor our meetings with Germans, and this request was immediately granted.</p>
<p>We traveled in our own car, accompanied by a Russian guide. This guide was a very polite young man named Viktor. Viktor was very helpful to us because our American car would have been stopped by the Soviets if not for the authority of his shoulder insignia.</p>
<p>Under Viktor's protection, we traveled a thousand miles through Soviet-controlled German territory. We met German politicians, workers, elementary school teachers, housekeepers, farmers, newspaper editors, mayors, and priests. We spoke with Soviet military government officials, propaganda experts, and plainclothes soldiers.</p>
<p>I had two basic questions in my mind: First, why do most Germans believe that life under Russian rule is chaotic and miserable? Second, what is the basic Russian policy in Germany?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question was difficult to find. From Berlin to Dresden, the places we passed looked quiet and prosperous. Every piece of land was cultivated. In the industrial centers that were not destroyed by our bombs, the smoke from the chimneys was rising steadily.</p>
<p>What about the food situation? When Germans were asked about this question, they quickly showed their ration cards. I found it strange: most of the food rations here were much larger than in other parts of the German occupation zone—Germans did not seem to pay as much attention to this fact as we did. Only meat seemed to be most abundant in the American occupation zone.</p>
<p>However, the people in the Soviet occupation zone did not seem to be eating very well. On the contrary, most of them had sunken eyes and looked tired from hunger. Although you don't see many fat Germans in the American occupation zone, it is even more difficult to find a German of average weight here.</p>
<p>Germans Fearful</p>
<p>We know that the reason for this phenomenon is very simple: there is almost no black market here. In the American-controlled area, almost everyone gets extra food from the black market, but here in the Soviet occupation zone, people have to rely entirely on the food they get from rations, because the Soviet discipline is very strict, scaring the Germans into obedience. In addition, all German bank accounts have been temporarily frozen "to prevent inflation." Except for the sick and the elderly who can withdraw limited deposits, the people here must rely on the money they get from actual work to survive.</p>
<p>Many Germans resent this restriction. But seeing the orderly state of affairs here, the anti-Soviet prejudices held by many Germans seem somewhat unreasonable.</p>
<p>How do Red Army soldiers behave? According to the Germans I spoke with, including several old friends, they all admitted that the behavior of the occupying forces could be called satisfactory. They told us: "Of course, there are occasional disturbances, but the situation now, given the circumstances, is almost normal."</p>
<p>Are Germans afraid of the Soviet measures against Nazi elements? In fact, Soviet policy on this point is not as strict as that of the American authorities. In the American occupation zone, no German who belonged to the Nazi Party or was related to Nazi organizations can hold a responsible position. But here in the Soviet occupation zone, former Nazis, except for a few "big shots," can be pardoned as long as they work hard and cooperate sincerely with the Russians.</p>
<p>Despite these facts, Germans continue to hate the Russians, which is attributed to Goebbels' propaganda. Germans living in the British and American occupation zones often hear that Russians are blood-sucking demons, so they assume that life in the Soviet occupation zone is completely terrifying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most Germans think that the British and Americans are kind and extravagant, with sometimes slightly ridiculous personalities. Therefore, people in the Soviet occupation zone envy the people in the British and American camps. They think that everyone there has a lot of food and games.</p>
<p>In the many public schools we visited, we could not find any traces of Marxist propaganda. Professor Zok, the provost of Jena University, told us that the Soviet authorities gave him all possible assistance but did not interfere with his plans.</p>
<p>Although the Russians have anti-German sentiments, they seem very concerned about German political and cultural affairs. This fact may not be easily understood by many Western observers. What is the Russian intention? Is there any truth to the rumors about a future Soviet-German alliance to counter Europe?</p>
<p>Of course, outsiders have no way of knowing the secrets of the Kremlin. But whatever plans the Soviet supreme political authorities are considering, the current fear of a Soviet-German alliance is, to put it mildly, unfounded.</p>
<p>Anti-Soviet Crusade</p>
<p>The Russians are clearly trying to strengthen the left-wing elements in Germany. But they do not regard German communists as "comrades" or potential allies, but as agents, only enough to assist the administrative work of the occupying country.</p>
<p>Obviously, German communists are willing to fight Western capitalism shoulder to shoulder with the Russians. But most Germans, when thinking about a possible Third World War, probably fantasize about an anti-Soviet crusade, enabling their country to rise again militarily.</p>
<p>If it is said that the average German would rather help destroy the Soviet Union than fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union, then the average Russian would laugh at the idea of fighting alongside Germany against the United States. Because Russians do not like Germans, but they do like Americans, and seem to completely misunderstand the anti-Soviet sentiments of the United States.</p>
<p>Our Russian guide, Lieutenant Viktor, was completely unaware of this ominous tension. One evening, he said: "Look at how these foolish Germans are staring at us. They are very surprised to see you Americans mingling with Red Army soldiers. They think we don't like each other. They think there will be war between us. They must be crazy!"</p>
<p>Hoping for Peace, No Ill Will</p>
<p>Strangely, we heard almost the same words from the American soldiers we met in Germany. These American soldiers belonged to a forty-man detachment that had been stationed in the Soviet occupation zone for the past five or six months.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" we asked them. "Are there only a few Americans living among so many Russians?"</p>
<p>They answered in unison: "We have never had any ill will between us. They have not given us any trouble. Most of them are good soldiers. They are doing a good job too!"</p>
<p>A middle-aged sergeant with glasses continued: "Some people seem to think that Germans are very similar to Americans. I definitely don't think so. In fact, Russians are more like us than Germans!"</p>
<p>Another American soldier, a young man from the American Midwest, shrugged his shoulders and said with contempt: "These Germans must be neurotic—thinking that there will be a war between the Russians and us. What an idea! I don't know much about politics, but I do know Russians. As far as I know, there is nothing wrong with them. So, how can we fight?"</p>

<h3 id="e163">The Rising Sun of Peace: The Clouds of Doubt Between the Four Powers Will Disappear! <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference, in a friendly and harmonious atmosphere, completed its historical task and ended successfully on the 12th of this month. The most important resolutions passed were two: (1) The draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, passed by the Paris Peace Conference, were approved; and it was decided that they would be signed in Paris on February 10th next year; at that time, these five countries could return to a normal state. (2) It was decided that the next Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Moscow on March 10th next year to discuss the draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Therefore, we cannot but believe that the achievements of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will have a major impact on the future situation, and at least make 1946 a peaceful year.</p>
<p>When British Foreign Secretary Bevin left New York to return home, he told the press: "The sun of peace is rising; misunderstandings between the four powers are dissipating, guaranteeing that all countries will move forward and create a foundation for lasting peace."</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly Also Has Significant Achievements</p>
<p>The second session of the United Nations General Assembly also declared a successful conclusion on the 14th of this month after passing the "Disarmament Charter." The scope of discussions at this United Nations General Assembly was very broad, such as (1) the issue of the Franco regime in Spain; (2) the issue of the veto power exercised by permanent members of the Security Council; (3) the issue of investigating the stationing of foreign troops in various countries; (4) the issue of general disarmament, all of which have been agreed upon. The most significant achievement is still the issue of disarmament, passing a "Disarmament Charter," the main points of which are as follows: (1) The United Nations General Assembly recognizes the need to rapidly implement general disarmament. (2) It urges the Security Council to adopt all practical and necessary measures, depending on the urgency of the work, to achieve this goal. The various plans drafted by the Security Council for this purpose should be sent to all member states of the United Nations, and then a special session of the United Nations General Assembly should be convened to review them. (3) It urges the Atomic Energy Commission to immediately pass measures to control atomic energy, so that its use is limited to peaceful purposes. (4) The United Nations countries should hand over their troops to the command of the Security Council to maintain world peace.</p>
<p>The French Cabinet Is Having a Difficult Birth</p>
<p>In the first vote of the French National Assembly, Communist candidate Dorriot lost the election. In the second vote, Popular Republican candidate Bidault also lost. So, who will come out to take on this difficult task? Post-war France is riddled with holes, especially in terms of finance, and the problems are numerous and urgently need to be solved. The current political turmoil cannot be allowed to drag on. Therefore, as a result of consultations between the leaders of various parties, they unanimously supported the return of Socialist leader Blum to power. Blum was elected Prime Minister in the third vote of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Although French politics has progressed, it has still not escaped the past practice of having many small factions. The Socialist Party is the third largest party in France, and Blum's assumption of office completely relied on the agreement of other parties, so its foundation is naturally very fragile, which goes without saying. However, the current problems in France are one, financial and monetary problems, and two, foreign policy problems, which cannot be solved without an outstanding old politician like Blum. However, as of now, Blum's cabinet is still having a difficult birth. If it is congenitally deficient and postnatally imbalanced, how can we expect it to grow and open up a new path for France's revival? Therefore, we still dare not be overly optimistic about France's future.</p>

<p>— By Associated Press, Ted Holmes, Translated by Lan Yu</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of California have recently lowered the fences guarding wartime secrets, allowing journalists and photographers to walk into the huge circular ventilated room of the newly completed 184-inch large atom-splitting machine for the first time.</p>
<p>Reporters discovered that atomic physicists live in another world of their own making and have their own language, even a monosyllabic word that seems foreign to outsiders. The journalists were deeply impressed by the visit, but gained very little knowledge.</p>
<p>In a large room in this building, it was filled with young people wearing white work clothes who looked very sincere. They were all busy patching up that steel behemoth. It stood tall, its height reaching all the way to the circular roof.</p>
<p>"This," said the person guiding the visit, "is the atom-splitting machine."</p>
<p>It is impossible for you to ignore it. This atom-splitting machine, which emits a four-thousand-ton magnetic force and is painted light yellow, looks like a huge foreign drip, which is separated into upper and lower parts by a rectangular vacuum steel box; the box is equipped with ingenious portholes, so that physicists can see the atomic splitting inside.</p>
<p>The power added by this new atom-splitting machine is three times greater than that of any similar machine before. The entire decomposition of the atom is hoped to be completed with it, rather than just partially "shaving" particles out of the atom as before.</p>
<p>The tour guide pointed out that when you approach this machine, its magnetism's attraction to the nails on your shoes will make you feel as if your feet weigh ten pounds each. "All the coins and keys on your body will rise from the bottom of your pocket and stick to the edge of your pocket. It's a very strange feeling," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Cocksey, the physicist in charge of this atom-splitting machine, said that he and his colleagues have not yet begun to move towards any research goals for the peacetime application of atomic energy or cosmic energy that can be compared to wartime atomic bombs.</p>
<p>"This research," he said, "is still in a very primitive stage. All we are doing now is trying to know more about this energy. The realization of its peacetime application is still in the future."</p>

<p>— Min, translated from the Chicago Sun Daily</p>
<p>Dr. Philip Morrison is a young American scientist who participated in atomic bomb research and manufacturing. After the war, he was the first to accompany experts to Japan to observe the damage caused by atomic bombs. In Hiroshima, he met Professor Yoshio Nishina of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of Japan and learned that Yoshio was carefully studying atomic energy, but his laboratory was pitifully simple. He did not have the sophisticated equipment that British and American scientists had. He only had some domestically produced instruments, whose value did not exceed US$20. It was even worse than the laboratory of a middle school student's family in Britain and the United States. He also had no chance to see the Smyth Report—a bulletin published by the US military department, which contained many (not all) atomic bomb manufacturing secrets—for reference. He only had an image of Hiroshima after the bombing. Based on the degree of destruction, he explored the secrets of the atomic bomb. He collected all the theories about atoms and drew many valuable drawings, the number and scope of which were surprising. Many of them were unknown to countries other than Britain and the United States. Due to the high speed and correct route of his research, who would believe that it was a product of a laboratory worth US$20? Morrison was amazed and deeply believed that if Yoshio had sophisticated equipment and more information, he would be able to catch up with Britain and the United States in a short period of time and discover all the secrets about atomic energy. Dr. Morrison finally said: "Atomic secrets are not reliable, and the only guarantee is the joint management of atomic energy and international understanding!"</p>
<h3 id="e168">England Plans to Seize Aviation Hegemony: Striving for Supremacy After the War, Aiming to Compete with the United States, Aircraft Factories Hasten Production of New Aircraft <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— —Shaw, London Aviation News, November 1st—</p>
<p>After the Great War, Britain is striving to revitalize its domestic industry, expediting production of goods intended for export in exchange for needed materials. In aviation, it is also striving for supremacy, aiming to compete with the United States, with ambitious plans to seize aviation hegemony.</p>
<p>British aircraft factories are hastening the manufacture of new aircraft, seeking progress in both speed and capacity. Currently, the fastest transatlantic aircraft averages 220 miles per hour from New York to London. With a tailwind, it can be even faster, reaching London from New York in just fourteen hours.</p>
<p>A few years from now, according to aviation experts, commercial flights between New York and London will take seven hours or less, with speeds increasing to 500 miles per hour. Within ten years, flights between London and New York may be shortened to two and a half to three hours. Businesspeople from both locations could then fly to discuss deals.</p>
<p>500 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>The aircraft currently being designed in Britain have a speed of 500 miles per hour and an altitude range of 30,000 to 40,000 feet. However, it is unlikely that they will appear in large numbers within a year or two. Specifically, there are roughly three types of commercial aircraft that Britain is preparing to manufacture. The first type is a twin-engine aircraft that can carry 20 to 30 passengers, with a speed of 400 miles per hour. This aircraft has a very high speed and is specifically designed for flights between major European cities, taking only two hours from London to Berlin and four hours to Moscow. It is expected to be completed next year.</p>
<p>The second type is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 350 miles per hour. It can carry 65 passengers. This type of aircraft is intended to compete with American aircraft on transatlantic and transpacific routes. The third type is called the "Flying Wing," also with four engines. It weighs 95 tons and has a speed of 600 miles per hour, making the flight from London to New York less than seven hours.</p>
<p>In addition, with more aircraft, more airports must be built. Long runways take up a lot of space. Therefore, there is a plan to build aviation airships to serve as airports. In this way, the problem of airports can also be solved.</p>
<p>The new aircraft designed by Britain have attracted worldwide attention, and several countries have already placed orders with Britain. The United States may also imitate them soon. The new British aircraft use Gasturbine gas turbines, while the United States continues to use Piston-type engines and is unlikely to change. This is because American businesses have invested millions in this area. Perhaps in six or seven years, American commercial aviation will begin to mass-produce British-style aircraft.</p>
<p>The United States Will Not Fall Behind</p>
<p>The United States is also designing new types of aircraft and is experimenting and manufacturing them. The United States believes that its aviation hegemony will not be taken away by the British, and is confident that it can hold the reins of world aviation, relying on the following types of aircraft.</p>
<p>The first is a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 400 miles per hour. Its passenger capacity is 46 to 180 people.</p>
<p>The second type is a six-engine aircraft. It can carry 400 passengers. Its range is 10,000 miles. Airships are also being manufactured. Some were originally for naval use during wartime and are now being converted for commercial use. This is not only true for airships, some passenger ships were also used to transport troops during wartime. For example, the passenger ship that departed from Shanghai in July and August of this year is one such example, and passengers are required to perform tasks such as sweeping and washing dishes, just like soldiers in wartime. From this point of view, the end of the war does not seem to be over. Full demobilization may still take time. The United States is also studying "Flying Wing" aircraft, and whether it will be successful depends on the results of the current experiments with "speed exceeding the speed of sound."</p>
<p>The United States believes that these types of aircraft can be compared to or even exceed Britain's Gas turbine gas turbine aircraft. Both the United States and Britain are designing aircraft that "exceed the speed of sound." The speed of aircraft is already close to the speed of sound—the speed of sound is 770 miles per hour (at normal temperature), but the effects of vibration at such high speeds have been little studied.</p>
<p>The United States' flight experiments to break the sound barrier may have important news to announce soon. Currently, there are plans to use a rocket-powered aircraft to ascend to an altitude of 70,000 to 80,000 feet. If this experiment is successful, commercial aviation will not have to worry about not being able to reach a speed of 1,000 miles per hour. In that case, any place in the world can be reached within twelve hours. (The End)</p>

<p>It has been nearly ten years since people in Shanghai have seen the paintings of Zhang Daqian. During these ten years, Daqian's artistic achievements and his great personal cultivation are truly worth mentioning. I will only briefly mention what I know.</p>
<p>A few days before the July 7th Incident, Daqian had just arrived in Beiping from Nanjing. Unexpectedly, as soon as he settled down, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. He had no choice but to live in seclusion in the Summer Palace, using poetry and painting to express his grief and indignation. Soon, enemy troops occupied the capital, and the situation became even more unbearable. In the western suburbs of Pingxi, the enemy's flames were raging, and even the Summer Palace was disturbed from time to time. Daqian, filled with grief and indignation, vowed to share the same fate. Then, a Western friend, braving the dangers, drove into the garden and forcibly pulled him into the city. At this point, driven by loyalty and righteousness, he immediately planned to go south. However, due to the chaos and blocked roads, he could not return. At that time, I lived in my hometown in western Anhui. I often received letters from Daqian, who complained that he was stuck in the north and could not return immediately. In the late summer of 1938, Daqian planned to have his family take his collection of famous works and leave Beiping first. Then, he quietly arrived in Tianjin and, with difficulty, crossed mountains and seas to reach Chongqing. His ability to escape the enemy's encirclement without being captured demonstrates Daqian's wisdom and courage. At that time, when we met, we were filled with mixed emotions of grief and joy. Talking about the past pleasures of Suzhou and Nanjing felt like another lifetime. In the winter of 1938, Daqian created dozens of paintings in Chongqing to raise funds for the soldiers at the front. At that time, the people of Chongqing admired Daqian's great personality and yearned for his style. His paintings were sold out in just three hours, raising thousands of yuan, all of which were used to provide winter clothing for the soldiers.</p>
<p>Later, he traveled to Qingcheng Mountain, admiring its beauty and producing even more works. Observing his style, which integrates both spirit and form, with ancient and noble qualities, he is truly superior to the artists of the Song and Yuan dynasties. This is because his talent is exceptional, and he is diligent and tireless. It is no accident that he has become a master of his generation. When Daqian was in Qingcheng Mountain, he sent me a letter, describing the beautiful scenery of the mountains, with its myriad appearances, enough to make one's heart feel clear and bright. I was moved and decided to visit, hoping to relieve my accumulated worries! When I arrived in Qingcheng Mountain, it was indeed as Daqian had said. It was both majestic and strange, both beautiful and secluded, and its depths were no less than those of Jiange, the Three Gorges, or Mount Emei (as Wu Zhilao said). The scenery varied with the wind and rain, the darkness and light, the four seasons, and the changes in weather. Especially the clouds on the Eight Diagrams Platform under Zhao Gong Mountain, which changed rapidly, were a magnificent natural spectacle. Daqian observed it day and night, capturing it all in his brushstrokes, down to every flower, every tree, every bird, and every butterfly in the mountains, detailing their nature, principles, and appearance, and sketching them all.</p>
<p>We then traveled north to avoid the Sword Gate, seeing the mountains cut across the wilderness, the sky and gorges overturned. We sang loudly, filled with a sense of independence. Daqian wrote a poem: "Going north and coming south between stone oxen, the King of Shu leads the Five Ding to rest. The white sun sways, dragons and snakes rage, hammers strike the mysterious sky, gods and ghosts worry. The mountains and rivers are naturally strategic, who says the passes limit spears and shields? Gentlemen, bear to weep at the new pavilion, one battle can still hold this state." The tone is sonorous, the meaning is deep, and it has the same exquisite craftsmanship as Du Fu's Sword Gate poem.</p>
<p>Daqian was also inspired by the beauty of Mount Emei and spent the whole year in the clouds and mist, much like the painting style of Bei Yuan and Nan Gong. If one wants to grasp the fusion of its heavenly secrets, one must be in it, so he decided to climb to its summit. His poem on visiting the Golden Summit of Mount Emei reads: "Thousands of layers of cliffs house spiritual vehicles, a sea of silver waves protects the treasure ship. After returning from the Five Sacred Mountains, I sit and lie as I please, suddenly surprised that the divine beauty is in the West."</p>
<p>After returning from Mount Emei, he felt that Dunhuang was a treasure of our country, and the murals in the Mogao Grottoes were all works of the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties. He had long cherished the desire to go there. Therefore, in the winter of 1940, he went west to Jiayu Pass to worship Buddha in Dunhuang, and then devoted himself to studying painting for three years. Living in a room in Mingsha during this time of war and turmoil, his spirit is truly admirable. His style also changed greatly. Every painting had a source, and every stroke had a history. Painting is where intent and emotion gather and heavenly secrets reside. To express intent and emotion fully, one must be based on learning. To penetrate heavenly secrets, one must have talent. Talent is bestowed by heaven and cannot be forced. However, having talent without learning, or learning without diligence, will not lead to success. Now, although Daqian takes his path from the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, he is able to wield his brush with depth and vigor, not limited by skill or bound by method. He not only dominates his generation, but is also enough to revive the decline of the past eight generations.</p>
<p>Last autumn, the desperate bandits were defeated, and Daqian happily said: "The dark areas will once again see the light of day, and my paintings will also be available for the appreciation of the people of Beijing and Shanghai." The people of Beijing and Shanghai have not forgotten Daqian, and Daqian should not forget the people of Beijing and Shanghai either. His life and personality are also the same as his painting style, bold and unrestrained, based on his carefree nature. He does not hesitate to spend millions on famous paintings, and he helps friends in need without stinginess, displaying the style of an ancient gentleman. Feng Ruofei once gave him a couplet saying, "Rich enough to rival a country, yet poor without a place to stand." Mr. Shen Yinmo also gave him a poem: "Zhang's wealth can rival a country, Zhang's poverty leaves him without a place to stand; both rich and poor, people do not understand, but see his frost-white beard. He admires Li Bai's drinking, he misses Lin Dongpo's poetry; painting is his lifelong love, he does not hesitate to call himself a painter before others. The six methods are nearly broken, and the historians hold their pens with trepidation; the gentleman expresses himself with his surroundings, not losing to Qu Tang, ashamed of Wu Gorge; the clear ape's wail is most eloquent, the white gulls are still intimate; his body is light as he travels thousands of miles to Dunhuang, encompassing the Six Dynasties and the Three Tang Dynasties; he returns to a room with only four walls, and burns incense after finishing the Thousand Buddhas." This couplet and poem are truly a portrait of Daqian. Now, Daqian's paintings are on display in Chun Shen. I wonder if there are any wise and virtuous people in Shanghai who, upon seeing his works, will find resonance in my words?</p>

<p>— Gan Si</p>
<p>In the biography of the American writer Henry D. Thoreau, there is such an anecdote: when the state government of a certain state in the United States arrested runaway black slaves and returned them to their original owners, Thoreau refused to pay taxes. He was therefore arrested and imprisoned. One day, Emerson asked him, "Henry (Thoreau's name), what are you doing here?" Thoreau asked in reply, "Waldo (Emerson's name), what are you doing not here?"</p>
<h3 id="e171">Introducing the British Engraving Exhibition <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>One evening, Mr. G. Hedley of the British Council came to my house and talked about the upcoming British Engraving Exhibition (Exhibition of Graphic Art) and consulted me about the location of the exhibition. I recommended the Daxin Gallery on Nanjing Road in the city center, which is convenient for transportation and allows the audience to easily concentrate on appreciating British art. This reminded me of sixteen years ago, in August 1930, when I went to London from Paris to spend the summer and visited the Royal Academy exhibition. The British art world, which represents the academic style, impressed me with its solemn and rigorous composition, its dignified and elegant coloring, and its meticulous brushwork. It seemed to lack a kind of unrestrained and free expression. This may be due to the conservative nature of the British national character, which is slightly different from the French style.</p>
<p>This small exhibition has only fifty works, including etchings, aquatints, engravings, metal engravings, and color woodcuts. Among them, the etchings by Job Nixon, No. 13, "Country Landscape," Strang's "St. Paul's Cathedral," and No. 15, "War," No. 16, "Portrait of Shaw," No. 17, Taylor's "Bathing," and No. 24, F. Dodd's "Portrait of the Painter Hunt," are the most outstanding, with rigorous lines and precise expression. (Attached picture) Dodd, born in 1874, is now seventy-two years old and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, and is one of Britain's leading contemporary painters.</p>
<p>There are also line engravings and wood carvings, such as S. Gooden's "Double Horse," No. 29. No. 20, "Dance," and No. 42, "Water City," are all excellent works. The other color woodcuts have a novel style and are full of primitive artistic interest, but the technique is ordinary, not as advanced as the Soviet woodcut world in recent years.</p>
<p>Engraving and woodcut originated in our country very early, such as the stone carvings of Xiaotangshan in the Han Dynasty and the stone carvings of Wu Liang Temple, which are well-known in the country. Woodcut is especially developed, and there have been excellent works handed down through the ages, which have influenced modern Japanese ukiyo-e. However, there has not been much progress in the last hundred years. Unlike Europe, in addition to engraving and woodcut, there are also etchings, aquatints, engravings, line engravings, and lithographs. This British engraving exhibition represents the great contribution of engraving to art in the past 150 years.</p>
<p>The American Council on Education published a beautiful catalog with the contents of this exhibition, with detailed explanations of the history of engraving, introductions to famous artists' works, and the types of engraving techniques. In addition to expressing artistic contributions, it also has the meaning of promoting arts and crafts, which is worthy of our attention. Because arts and crafts are the only tool to improve human culture and promote the beautification of life.</p>

<p>— Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>The table is still here, still in my hometown home, oh my melancholy and gentle land! Beyond the mountains, the beautiful twilight is stretching out snowy hands to beckon.</p>
<p>The gray sky of cloudy days, those disheveled clouds, are drifting towards the horizon, and the yellow sorrow compels me to be excited.</p>
<p>The shadow of the setting sun is falling on the dome of the church head. Oh, my friends who played with me, I'm afraid I won't see you again.</p>
<p>The years pass in oblivion, and you don't know where you ran with it... Only the flowing water is still noisy in front of the winged waterwheel as it was before.</p>
<p>I often pray for the unreturned travelers in the misty land, in the twilight, in the moans of the broken moss.</p>
<p>Snowstorm</p>
<p>The snowstorm is fiercely blowing, and there are unfamiliar carriages flying in the wilderness. A stranger is sitting in a carriage and flying.</p>
<p>Where is my happiness? Where is my joy? Everything is passing by in the same crazy carriage under the fierce whirlwind.</p>
<p>(October 1925)</p>
<p>Sky Blue Jacket</p>
<p>Sky blue women's jacket. Green eyes. I have never uttered such a true heart to my lover.</p>
<p>My lover asked me, "Is the snowstorm blowing? Light the stove, make the bed." I replied to my lover, "Now, someone is scattering white flowers from a high place.</p>
<p>You light the stove and make the bed, my heart does not have you, but a snowstorm is blowing."</p>

<p>Wine</p>
<p>If life is a prison-like torment and suffering, then intoxication and bewilderment should be happiness and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Frowning, enduring bitterness, ....</p>
<p>Excited? Like a kite with a broken string, without direction, without a goal, all that pervades is an empty soul.</p>
<p>The undulation of the water, the beating of the heart, weaves a rhythm without rhythm, and many streams of melancholy are seeking temporary rest. Reason helps you break into an unfamiliar society, and reason also helps you embrace troubles. Just use reason, and you have to prepare to leave reason.</p>
<p>Looking at the world with drunken eyes, how foolish these humans are. Looking at the world with drunken eyes, how beautiful these things are. But the mist will always dissipate, and life will only appear smaller.</p>
<p>Smoke</p>
<p>Looking at life through the mist, the blur is still lovely after all.</p>
<p>I see the firelight, I see the cheers of life. I see the smoke, I see the beautiful illusions.</p>
<p>One by one, ....</p>
<p>With it, I still feel empty; without it, I feel even more lonely.</p>
<p>Life is a mystery, and the rings of smoke may also ignite your thoughts of answering, you will conjure up thousands of answers, although perhaps they will slowly fall empty.</p>
<p>The mist is irregular, and who can figure it out!</p>
<p>What is contained in the irregularity is regularity. Millions of rotations, millions of advances, millions of retreats.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's like a pool of quiet emotional water; sometimes, it's like a raging tide of ten thousand horses galloping.</p>
<p>Isn't a cup of light green tea, a cup of strong coffee, just as endlessly delicious?</p>
<p>Slow pace or fast pace, let's temporarily isolate reality! Heaven overturns, the earth is covered, I hope everyone is crazy.</p>
<p>Rotate, rotate, where is the end, and who can tell!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>What is this if not a challenge? If Pingzi does not answer these questions, then it is a split; they will part ways, each establishing their own banner; whether it is a struggle in the open or a fight in the dark, it will be fine. If she answers these questions clearly, that is tantamount to surrendering? Because everyone has secrets, why shouldn't she be allowed to keep her secrets? After she reveals these secrets, what special privilege does Tsurumi have not to reveal his own secrets? This is obviously unfair.</p>
<p>Pingzi did not waver much after hearing Tsurumi's words, and only smiled slightly, "Before I answer you, I have two questions, please explain them to me first; because these two questions exceed my ability to answer: "If I answer these three questions to you, without any deception, on my part, would it be betraying secrets to my father and your father, and Master Aoki? If I betray secrets, would it be betraying my personality?"</p>
<p>"What other question is there?" Tsurumi asked again.</p>
<p>"Is there any more?" Pingzi was a little hesitant, as if she couldn't say it; but immediately she seemed to muster up her courage, "Brother Huo, in case... after I answer these three questions, in case... these three aspects, of course including me, - the positions of these three aspects, happen to be contrary to your ideas, and all go against her, you will naturally understand everything about me; but I don't know anything about you; at that time, do you think I will still have hope? ..."</p>
<p>"What kind of hope?" Tsurumi did not know what Pingzi could hope for, referring to love, but he did not knowingly ask, Tsurumi was not so cunning and despicable, because the relationship was too important, there could not be a trace of ambiguity, so he had to ask clearly.</p>
<p>"Brother, my thoughts, in these twenty hours since we met, my actions and words have been expressed very clearly, maybe Brother did not take this expression seriously, but I personally think it is very serious - Brother has worked on the mainland for five or six years, and of course there are many women chasing after him, maybe Brother has a very reasonable object in mind, maybe more than one. But what I ask for is that Brother Huo also allows me to participate as a member, as one of the candidates. I can't take care of failure or victory now, and I will never care about it in the future. ... Even if I fail!" As Pingzi said, her head gradually lowered, and her voice became lower and lower, with a hint of resentment.</p>
<p>Hearing these words of love, Tsurumi's heart must have resonated with some sympathy, and he seemed to be unable to bear to listen any longer, so he left Pingzi and turned away, walking back and forth at a distance of three or four steps. Pingzi was still standing there with her head bowed, like a volunteer waiting to be announced as selected or not. Tsurumi paced back and forth for a while, and then returned to Pingzi's side:</p>
<p>"Pingzi, these two questions of yours are difficult for me to answer, but I have to answer you after all, don't I? For the first question, you explain the ideas of you and Elder Aoki, etc., you think it is betraying secrets, but I think it is just some guidance in friendship. Originally, I didn't have to ask you directly like this, at most I would only have to spend a few more hours of work, and a few indirect words would be enough to find out. But now that you have asked me, and you think it is betraying secrets, betraying one's responsibilities, then you have to bear it yourself....</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Taken from the people, used for the people. Very fair, and everyone supports it. But the people are poor and their pockets are empty, so you can't say "I'm still spending it on you" and forcibly extort them. A foreign reporter praised Mayor Wu's famous saying: killing the chicken will not get you eggs. If taxes have forced the people to death, who will this money be raised for and spent on?</p>
<p>For example, the house tax, the dilapidated house in the alley where I live, located remotely on Jiangwan Road, has to pay tens of thousands of yuan this quarter. I have always been very confused and afraid of trouble, and I am even more sincerely obedient to the law, so the day after the notice arrived, I obediently went to pay. After paying, I thought carefully, this burden is really too heavy. An average of nearly ten thousand yuan a month in house tax, what kind of proportion is this for personal income! Moreover, averaging one house at ten thousand yuan a month, if there are 500,000 houses in Shanghai, the municipal government's income from house tax alone would be 5 billion, which is amazing!</p>
<p>Also, the business tax on the book industry, the Ministry of Finance has now decided that textbooks can be exempted, the intention being that other books should not be given preferential treatment, which is also extremely unreasonable. Recently, the book industry has been becoming more and more depressed, and is basically facing a situation where it cannot be maintained. Even if the business tax is waived, it will still be necessary to hold cultural loans to enable them to stand firm, otherwise, there is only one way to close down. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, culture has already been devastated, and the decline in the level of knowledge is evident in the students of all levels of schools today, which is really terrible. How to catch up quickly and find ways to remedy this is the responsibility of the publishing industry, and even more so the responsibility of the government authorities.</p>
<p>Also, there is also income tax, and the method of calculating it is also worth studying.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council already had a new decision on the municipal construction donation (house tax), which will not be doubled in winter, and will be reduced by one-third compared to autumn, which is really a bright measure, speaking for the people, and seeking to reduce the burden on the people. At the same time, the municipal financial authorities are also saying that if citizens have opinions on the valuation, they can request a revaluation.</p>
<p>The saying "the government is desperate for money" is very popular, and the authorities must consider what the people can afford, otherwise this saying will really become a fact and spread even wider.</p>

<p>— Translated by Shen Boxin from the December issue of "Reader's Digest Continued".</p>
<p>Several brands of ballpoint pens already exist in the Shanghai market. Their advantages have already been introduced in several articles. Below, let's discuss some fragments of the history of invention and the competitive situation among manufacturers.</p>
<p>The ballpoint pen originated in Hungary. The inventor was a versatile veteran named Biro, who had studied medicine, was skilled in painting, and was adept at writing. Dissatisfied with the various shortcomings of fountain pens, he and his brother, the chemist Georg, began to research and create a better writing tool. The initial design was quite bulky. Subsequently, in 1939, they continued to experiment in Paris. Soon after, the war broke out. In June 1940, Biro fled to Buenos Aires, South America. By that time, he was penniless. He sought capitalists everywhere in Argentina. As a result, an Argentinian and a British person became interested in his pen-making plan and provided funding.</p>
<p>It was not until 1943 that the first pen was made in Argentina. He began to use a capillary action ink supply system and achieved success.</p>
<p>The Opportunity Arrived Just in Time</p>
<p>At the end of 1943, a pen made by Biro was sent by airmail to Mr. Mousse, the manager of the Eberhard Faber factory in New York (the factory is famous for pencils, etc.). After a trial, it was immediately put aside, but Mousse had to try it again every few days. Finally, he handed it over to his engineers for research. In May 1944, he went to South America to negotiate the purchase of the production and sales rights of this new pen in the United States. It just so happened that the military expressed interest in purchasing 10,000 non-leaking fountain pens (because ordinary fountain pens would leak ink automatically at high altitudes due to low air pressure) for use by the air force. As a result, the three major pen manufacturers, Eversharp, Sheaffer, and Parker, simultaneously competed with the E. Faber factory to purchase the production and sales rights in the United States. In the end, Eversharp won with the highest price—calculating a figure $300,000 higher than the $200,000 offered by E. Faber, and also allocating 5 and 1/2 percent of the sales revenue in the United States to the inventor. The factory immediately mobilized engineers to improve the structure of the ballpoint pen and actively promoted it.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Gimbels department store in New York published an advertisement in October, stating: "The long-awaited new wonder pen has begun to be sold in our store." Everyone thought it must be the one invented by the Hungarian. In fact, it was not. The Eversharp factory was still painstakingly experimenting with the new pen, and the model was still being improved. What the department store was selling was made by another friend, Reynolds (Milton Reynolds), who had taken the lead.</p>
<p>Good at Business</p>
<p>Reynolds is now 54 years old. He was quite successful in the tire business when he was young. He became rich at the age of 26 and went bankrupt at the age of 27. Since then, he has experienced both wealth and poverty. During this war, he transported 250,000 silver lighters from Mexico to the United States and sold them out quickly, making a profit of one million.</p>
<p>In April 1945, Reynolds saw ballpoint pens for sale in a shopping mall in Buenos Aires. He bought half a dozen and immediately gathered engineers and lawyers familiar with patent regulations to study them after returning home. As a result, they believed that it was possible to avoid using the structure patented by Biro to make a ballpoint pen. In a hurry, he completed a model before Eversharp. On October 29, Gimbel's department store sold 60,000 of Reynolds' pens in New York. Within a week, 25,000 pens were sold, each for $12.50. At the same time, the door of Reynolds' office was crowded.</p>
<p>Reynolds promoted it even more aggressively. He offered a $33,000 prize to hold a ballpoint pen display competition. As a result, 5,000 stores participated. He also offered many prizes to encourage sales. There were many types of prizes, from household washing machines to pearl necklaces. The prize catalog printed in four-color plates had 48 pages. The publicity expenses in the first year reached a huge sum of $848,000. At one point, Reynolds specially sent someone to give ballpoint pens to politicians, reporters, and social celebrities. He himself flew all over the world, planning to open branches in England, France, Australia, and other places. He also made many transactions along the way. Once, in the restroom of an airplane crossing the Indian Ocean, he demonstrated writing on thin paper (toilet paper, etc.) with a ballpoint pen to a fellow passenger. As a result, he received a large number of orders.</p>
<p>When Reynolds was making a lot of money from ballpoint pens, other manufacturers were preparing to overwhelm him in terms of quality. Indeed, Reynolds' ballpoint pen had unsatisfactory shortcomings. Within seven months, 104,643 pens were returned. Eversharp factory spent $2 million on research work. Sheaffer factory had tested it 5,000 times, including 30 different models. Parker factory also spent nearly $300,000 on testing. Eversharp's "CA" pen did not appear on the market until April, with a price of $15, and large-scale publicity was carried out at the same time.</p>
<p>Effective Promotion</p>
<p>Eversharp's salesmen had various skills, such as pouring water on the writing paper, writing in the water, wiping off the water stains, and the words still remained. There were also demonstrations of writing on thin muslin handkerchiefs, or shaking the ballpoint pen vigorously to show that it did not leak, etc.</p>
<p>Eversharp factory estimated that the sales volume in 1946 could reach $20 million, then the invention tax drawn by Biro would be more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Now, the battle of ballpoint pens is in full swing. There have been five or six lawsuits in court. Reynolds sued Eversharp and E. Faber factories for violating the "Anti-Trust Law" and demanded compensation of $1 million. The two factories also countersued Reynolds, demanding compensation of $1 million, accusing him of "seizing" the market they were preparing. This year, all pen factories spent a total of about $3 million on publicity, most of which was aimed at each other. When Sheaffer's ballpoint pen was born, the title of the advertisement was "Not grown in the greenhouse—already complete!" and so on.</p>
<p>Now Eversharp factory has made five or six colors of ink, and you can choose the color core you like and replace it.</p>
<p>At the same time, cheap brands have also appeared one after another. Now the total daily output of various factories in the United States is probably more than 60,000 pens.</p>
<p>The pen invented by Biro is indeed a landmark transformation of writing tools. The blind exploration in the past few years, and the current struggle. These are all part of the price we pay for striving for progress.</p>

<p>A teacher attempted to do an important scientific experiment, but could not proceed. So he visited a millionaire, but was rejected. The following conversation began between them:</p>
<p>Millionaire: "It's really strange, I only see teachers always coming to find millionaires, but I've never seen millionaires going to find teachers?"</p>
<p>Teacher: "Because teachers understand that they have no money, but millionaires never think that they lack knowledge."</p>
<p>Millionaire: "Then why are millionaires willing to help the blind, the lame, and other disabled people, but they don't like to help poor teachers?"</p>
<p>Teacher: "Because they are afraid that they may become blind, lame, etc. in the future, but they will never become teachers!"</p>

<p>Bleeding · Begging for Blood</p>
<p>After a wicked beggar comes to the door and "gets bloodied," the shop or residence where the incident occurred will naturally panic. Because this beggar is bleeding because he couldn't get money, it is obviously my fault. So they are more generous and give more money, satisfying his desires and letting him leave. The beggar then supports his bloody face and walks to the door of the neighbor. At this time, there must be many children and passers-by following him. When the shopkeeper sees this hideous face, he is unwilling to let this person stay outside the door for a long time, so he has to quickly give money to send him away. Then he goes to the third and fourth house. Once "bloodied," it is very easy to get money. But each time he only begs on one side of the road, and absolutely does not beg at the shops on the opposite side of the street on the same day. The reason why the gang adopted coercive begging is because they are confident that the previous emperor specially allowed them to "beg at every door." If you don't give him money, the fault lies with the people. The gang also has a hard-line method, in addition to begging for money, other daily necessities, such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt, can also be "apportioned" to people when there is a shortage.</p>
<p>This kind of bleeding, self-inflicted suffering scheme is naturally terrible in the imagination of ordinary people. Especially since a lot of blood has to be shed each time, it seems to be detrimental to health, and it cannot be recovered without resting for many days. But the people in the beggar gang regard it as commonplace, because they have undergone special training and have swallowed various grains and special secret recipes from an early age. They have developed the habit of breaking their foreheads. Although their skin and flesh are injured, they do not feel pain. In fact, their forehead bones have long been broken and have become a large cave. Each time they get bloodied and shed some blood, the wound is extremely easy to heal. The next time they "break ground," it is still the old wound. Only some blood flows on the surface, but the observers are shocked, thinking that the forehead bone has been broken and the situation is serious.</p>
<p>Due to the vastness of Shanghai, the beggar boss divides the area into several districts, each with a leader to manage the beggars. The seniority can be divided into seven or eight levels. But no matter which group goes out to "do the street" (begging) or "goes alone" (begging alone), the money they earn each day must be handed over. Then it is distributed according to a percentage. The distribution percentage varies according to seniority. Senior beggars can get 50% (fifty percent). Low-level beggars only get 20%. The beggar boss enjoys as much as 80%, which is really extremely exploitative. But the beggar boss also speaks with conviction. Because in the past, there were beggar factories, and all food and lodging expenses were controlled by the beggar boss. If there is severe winter with rain and fog, beggars can be exempted from going out to "do the street" when they are sick, but porridge is still supplied as usual. Low-level beggars are mostly people with low abilities, and their income is extremely limited. But their appetite is the same as that of other beggars, so heavy exploitation is inevitable.</p>
<p>The "hard-core" beggars absolutely do not allow any shortage in the amount that should be handed over each day, and they absolutely dare not reduce it. A group of new beggars who have just started out in the business think that the beggar boss is not observant and cannot know how much they beg each day, so they deliberately hide a part of it. Who knows that if they deceive him one day, the case will be solved sooner or later. When the beggar boss first realizes that the handover is too small, he pays attention. When he sees that their expressions are wrong, he conducts a full body search. As a result, "concealing stolen goods" constitutes a crime and they must be punished.</p>

<h3 id="e181">One-Legged General Chen Ce <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>General Chen Ce, the former mayor of Guangzhou, took the road to Beijing after resigning. It was initially rumored that he would be appointed as the deputy commander-in-chief of the navy, but this was later proved to be inaccurate. Recently, it has been rumored that this naval veteran, who is already 53 years old, may be appointed as the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Whether this is true will be known after the government is reorganized.</p>
<p>General Chen, whose courtesy name is Zhishuo, is from Qiongshan County, Hainan Island, Guangdong Province. He graduated from the Huangpu Naval Academy and has held important naval positions. He is a romantic and unrestrained person who does not stick to appearances. When it comes to the nickname "Uncle Ce," he is well-known in South China.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, General Chen happened to be in Hong Kong as the chairman of the Kuomintang Hong Kong and Macau General Branch. Before the fall of Hong Kong, Chen, with the help of the athletic Xu Ting, swam across the sea and escaped to Chongqing. This story is a famous episode in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has one leg amputated, but he has an artificial leg designed by a British doctor. His movements are flexible, and he is no different from ordinary people. When he wears a suit and trousers, it is simply impossible to see any flaws.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, when the central government's power had not yet reached the two Guangdong provinces, Mr. Chen had already been inclined to the central government. He fell out with Chen Jitang, the "King of Southern Heaven" at the time. However, because Mr. Zhishuo also had considerable prestige in Guangdong Province, the invincible "King of Southern Heaven" could not do anything to him.</p>
<p>Before the victory, General Chen had been appointed as the mayor of Guangzhou. He resigned less than a year after taking office. It is said that the reason for his resignation was a conflict of opinion with his superior, Luo Zhuoying, the chairman of the province. He resigned in a fit of anger, living up to the true colors of a soldier.</p>
<p>The General is highly valued by President Sun Zhesheng, and he is also very compatible with Situ Meitang, the leader of the Minzhi Party.</p>
<p>Currently, General Chen is still staying in Beijing, probably waiting for a new appointment from the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Who is Misleading Students? <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ming</p>
<p>After reading the insightful comments of Mr. Shengjie and Mr. Fangcheng on "misleading students" in this journal, I feel that one is speaking from the student's perspective, and the other is "defending" from the teacher's situation. Both sides have their own subjective reasons; however, in fact, they both overlooked a major person who caused "misleading students." If we use today's housing disputes as an analogy, Mr. Shengjie is like a subtenant who pays a high rent but cannot live in a good house; Mr. Fangcheng is like a landlord who has a good house but cannot receive a decent rent. The reason is that between the landlord and the subtenant, there is a black-hearted second landlord who profits from it. Mr. Shengjie and Mr. Fangcheng overlooked the school owner, who is equivalent to the second landlord, the main person who caused "misleading students."</p>
<p>"Cheating" teachers should be kicked out of the school gate. From the student's perspective, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, and it is a matter of course. But school owners are welcoming such teachers, the only reason being that these teachers can be hired at the lowest price. In this way, school owners can use a small part of the tuition revenue as the teacher's salary, and use most of the tuition revenue as capital for speculative trading, or engage in usury. Under the influence of greed, running a school in the minds of school owners is a tool for planning speculative capital. Students' studies and teachers' lives are naturally not in their "consideration."</p>
<p>The hardship of teachers' lives is an undeniable fact today. Teachers take on more classes to maintain their livelihoods, resulting in "misleading students." In theory, this should not be the case, but in fact, it is a need for survival; but the "executioner" who causes teachers to have to take on more classes for the sake of their livelihoods, resulting in "misleading students," is the school owner who aims to make money by running the school. Now I can give two more examples to illustrate: There is a Mr. Wang who opened a primary and secondary school on ×× Road, and put more than 40 million yuan of tuition revenue out for short-term interest. Unexpectedly, he suffered a "bad debt," so teachers who could not "find another job" had to "endure hardships" and "struggle through the years," following the unlucky boss "working for the public on an empty stomach." There is also a Mr. Shen who opened a primary and secondary school on ×× Road, and most of the teachers he hired were either from the same hometown or relatives, either the school principal's "godson" or the school principal's "adopted daughter." Everyone is there to "help out," and "give some money casually" is the reality. Other subjects that cannot be taken care of have to be taught by "outsiders," so "outsiders" have to wait for the principal to release the tuition money and receive the interest before they can get their salary. These facts all show that the suffering of teachers comes from the exploitation of the principal. So, isn't the fact very clear? Who is the real culprit of "misleading students"?</p>
<p>Among the many schools in Shanghai, although there are many schoolshops that "mislead students," there are also many schools that are working hard to cultivate talents. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of "misleading students," I suggest that news reporters should investigate the actual situation of all schools in this city for our second generation, and give a true and honest introduction of the good and the bad, so that students can choose accordingly. But there is a very important question here, that is, the report must be absolutely true.</p>
<p>This is my view on "misleading students." Whether it is right or not remains to be seen by the criticisms of the diners.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Hardships of the Employees of the Two Railways <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Lin</p>
<p>The railway job, which is generally regarded as a "golden rice bowl," is actually not something that can be said out loud. It's like a "gilded box with a white copper lock," good-looking on the outside but empty on the inside.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an employee of the two railways who had served for many years and had excellent results also sighed about his hardships. He said, "We employees of the two railways are almost like cats and dogs. Why? Look! (He pointed to his uniform with the index finger of his right hand) We wear one suit of hair in the cold and summer, alas! Since the victory, only one black cloth uniform has been issued. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, we wear it all year round. We have no chance to change it. In the summer, the smell of sweat is overwhelming, and in the winter, we can't resist the cold, alas! And the color has changed to neither yellow nor black, and there are holes everywhere. We don't look neat, and at a glance, you know that we are the 'second class'."</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief and continued, "It's kind of a joke, but we work in the same organization. Why is there always a two-week difference between the date of salary payment at Shanghai North Station and the date of salary payment for us? Now prices are rising every day and night. Can we afford to have half a month's difference? Not to mention anything else, just take coal balls as an example. Last month and this month? They are almost twice as expensive. I heard that the authorities originally did not have any difference in the date of salary payment for employees. It has always been uniform. How does the accountant explain this?"</p>
