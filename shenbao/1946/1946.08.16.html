<h3>馬帥偕宋院長抵牯　聞携有周恩来致主席函　廬山談話會下月始開幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕馬帥十五日下午二時許離寗海路行館赴機塲乘專機四度飛潯轉牯嶺，何日下山，當視國共談判環境之需要。潯二套口機連日爲水所浸，飛機未能降落，今午據九江消息，水猶未退，然馬帥竟冒險飛往。聞馬帥携周恩來氏致蔣主席函一件，衆信內容為共黨對主席文告之反應。又據悉：馬帥原定提早返國，惟目聯合聲明發表後，國共雙方之反應仍表示願繼續談判，以解決政治問題，因此馬帥已不作提早返國之打算。據聞美國參院方面，曾一再希望馬帥歸國，蓋一般認爲馬帥對中國之和平調處業已無望，惟大部議員則深盼馬帥能親自返國，對參院作負責之報吿，重定對策，然馬帥個人深察我國目前之情勢，始終認為和平商談之門未閉，故決作最後努力，暫不返國。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十五日電〕馬歇爾元帥十五日下午六時半與宋院長子文，偕隨員秘書等聯袂抵牯。馬帥夫人仍親往小天池迎接馬帥。經過牯嶺街市時，若干熟識馬帥之兒童，繞其肩與隨行歡呼取樂，馬帥報以慈祥微笑。馬帥旋返河西路四十號行館休息，宋院長抵達後，即逕往晋謁主席，談話約一小時，即由蔣夫人相送至三號宋氏寓所聞宋氏明日即將下山返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十五日電〕宋院長十五日於進入牯嶺街市前語往迎記者，前次離牯時曾與主席約定每兩週來牯報吿政情一次，此來即係奉行前言，外傳政府將召開廬山談話會事，渠尙不知</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十五日電〕宋院長十五日於進入牯嶺街街市前語往迎記者，前次離牯時會與主席約定每兩週來牯報告政情一次，此來即係奉行前言，外傳政府將召開廬山談話會事，渠尙不知供國民大會討論抉擇，以期制完善可行的憲法，即為主席將在牯嶺召集各大學校長，各省市參議會議長，以及其他各方人士舉行交換意見之談話會的主要宗旨。相信各黨派代表必能來此參加，提供意見，作成完善可行的憲草，使國民大會如期舉行。聞此項談話會將於十月十日參政會舉行以前，開幕約在九月二十日左右，會期約一週。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺十五日電〕靑年黨主席曾琦及中常委劉東岩，本日暢游仙人洞及大天池，日內即返京。據悉：該黨機關報建議召開廬山談話會事，曾氏尙未向蔣主席正式提出。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺五日電〕盛傳廬山將召開談話會事，經記者向可靠方面探詢，據答並無所聞</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十五日電〕據此間明瞭政府之人士鄭重表示，政府對於共黨始終寬容退讓，關於共軍，並不要求其全部退出其在亭戰令後所攻佔地區，僅要求其撤出若干已經構成和平威脅和阻礙交通之地區，目前此項地區當以蘇北爲主。</p>
<p>（尙有滬市商會呈蔣主席電，及致毛澤東電，請閱第二版。）</p>
<p>美重視主席文告</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十四日電〕有以對蔣主席勝利日文吿感觀詢諸國務院者，該院發言人答謂：國務院對於此項文吿，極感興趣，但外交界對蔣主席之文吿，則有若干之失望情緒在焉，彼等認爲蔣主席之文吿，並未能針對現行局勢發言，觀察家認爲該項文吿無非重申蔣氏在過去四年中之一貫立塲而已。馬帥與司徒大使已發現國民黨政府非俟共黨放下武器，不願與之討論政治，而在另一方面，共黨則堅持必須在政治商談後始能放下武器。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十四日電〕紐約時報及紐約前鋒論壇報，均以首頁顯著地位刊載　蔣主席文告，然未加詳論，多數標題着重蔣主席保證結束一黨統治一點。</p>
<h3>饒伯森葉劍英離京　行前與周恩來同訪馬特使</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕北平軍調部美方委員饒伯森，共方委員葉劍英昨日抵京後，即晚分別與馬帥暨周恩來長談，十五日上午再與馬帥共同晤面，下午三時半業劍英離京返平，饒伯森則偕美駐華軍事顧問團團長魯克斯同機飛滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕馬帥十五日晨十時半曾接見饒伯森，周恩來，葉劍英三氏，詳討安平事件之始末。又聞，今日談話內容，可能曾涉及北平軍調部問題，因執行部之工作顯已完全停頓，然究應撤銷或加强，馬帥尙在愼重考慮中。據一部份人士之意見，認爲若加强執行部工作，唯一方式即爲加强美方調處人員之權力，然不能獲共黨之同意自在意中。有人謂執行部果爾撤銷，必在馬帥對和平談判正式表示失敗之時。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕據悉，共黨對於安平事件曾有照會致馬帥，說明此事實况，外間多不知其內容，觀察家認爲：安平事件乃共黨在外交一大失敗，綠在此事發生前，美國會議員曾一再討論對華政策，考慮撤兵及停止程借法案及軍事援華案，然待安平事件發生後，美國內同情共黨者，頓即改變觀念，故原在考慮中之諸問題，現已不復爲美朝野所注視矣。</p>
<h3>安平時間報告　美共針鋒相對</h3>
<p>廿五小組今再開會</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕廿五小組定十六日晨再度開會，並可能開始聽取搭乘美軍巡邏隊車輛之執行部職員傅瑞慈少校及丟克君之證言。該小組於過去兩週中所進行之調查工作，至爲有限，戴維斯在其致饒伯森之初步報吿中，僅有指出下列各點：（一）美陸戰隊衝突事，對手或爲共軍。（二）衝突事件地點，並非一任何部隊，任何居民所經常佔留者，而係沿平津公路之農田地帶，且於七月廿九日中午，在當地出現之任何人，皆係自他處暫時來者。（三）參加衝突之共軍指揮官與其軍隊任務，尙未判明。（四）本組未獲得任何國軍參加該項衝突之證據。至共黨代表黃逸峯，則在其報吿書中針對戴維斯報吿予以解釋：（一）安平鎭原爲共軍駐地，現已被政府軍進駐。（二）美方參加衝突人負傅瑞慈少校，丟克君所指定之衝突地點，並無戰爭痕跡。（三）美方所指衝突地點，乃一片平原，地形開闊，公路兩旁無深壕溝。（四）美方報吿中之作爲障碍之無輪牛車及深坑亦無。（五）美方報吿中之碉堡亦無，政府代表張叔衡之報吿書，對實地調查結果則未提及。</p>
<h3>混亂嚴重局勢　全由中共造成</h3>
<p>星洲南洋商報評時局</p>
<p>〔中央社新加坡十五日電〕此間重要華文報紙，今早以「誰應負和平商談失敗責任」爲題，指稱：共黨應負造成我國混亂嚴重局勢之責，並相信和平商談，確已絕望，而武力解決，雖將招致災禍，然非不可想像者也，此舉至少可能解救人民，使免長期受苦。又今日此間所有華文報紙，均於首頁刊出主席之文吿，此間僑胞，能獲機會閱讀當日發出之領袖文吿原文，尙屬初次。</p>
<h3>中共攻擊馬帥</h3>
<p>周恩來也要發表文件</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳中共主張將中國問題提交聯合國安全理事會解決一說，據中共發言人陳家康謂，僅得傳聞，未能證實，記者詢以中共是否仍主張由馬歇爾調停？陳氏答：此事將由周恩來文吿中發表。記者追詢文吿內容，陳答：「文吿是有一個的，不過今天恐怕不會發出，余遠處上海無從縣揣」。陳氏否認中共與蘇聯及外蒙訂約之說，指爲「北平所傳，全非事實」。對主席文吿，陳氏未予置評，僅謂按目前情形，中共保持緘默，或更可有裨局勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕此間一般人相信，共產黨之竭力攻擊馬歇爾特使，乃共黨要求請蘇聯與英美共同調處中國衝突之先聲</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十五日電〕延安解放日報社論，今日首次公開攻擊馬歇爾特使，謂其對於未能停止中國衝突，不能辭其咎。該報同時仍猛烈指責美國軍事援助國民政府。共黨以前批評美國助華及美軍駐華之不當，同時則常恭維馬使個人之出力斡旋和平，今論調已一變。</p>
<h3>大同北關一度被突破　娘子關展開激戰　豫東共軍沿隴海路竄犯</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十五日電〕娘子關展開激烈爭奪戰，十四日下午二時許，共軍以七千餘向車站猛烈進攻，迄晚劇戰猶在進行中。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原十五日電〕晋中共軍約二團之兵力，企圖積極破壞正太鐵路，向太谷東之陽邑鎭猛撲，我守軍雖予痛擊，但以衆寡懸殊，被其攻佔。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕大同情勢危殆，北關曾一度被攻城共軍突破，沙岑戰况激烈，空前未有，平旺機塲，刻仍在國軍手中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕軍息：大同戰事仍在外圍斷續進行，政府仍確保機塲，戰事已延至城下說不確。惟今日官方宣稱：城內小組住處附近已落一砲彈。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕官方消息，劉伯誠現正率十萬大軍，進出隴海東段，其部隊已陷蘭封，抵興隆集，西迫開封城廂。官方情報謂，劉已被委爲共軍華北總司令兼平漢綫總指揮，與劉伯誠同時出動者，尙有攻黃口車站與碭山之程原部與攻泗縣新四軍，此外豫北新鄉東南卅里古固寨，昨晨亦發現共軍萬餘人，據某有資格人士分析稱，共軍此舉在切斷豫北突出地帶（安陽新鄕）國軍與黃河以南國軍之聯絡，並威脅徐州。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕軍調部對豫東衝突極爲關懷，擬令新鄕第十小組派一分組前往開封，遏止衝突。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封十五日電〕共產軍劉伯誠部，現經考城蘭封東西地區，向隴海路沿綫進犯，其目的除破壞隴海路交通外，刻正準備決潰黃河故口堤防（在考城蘭封之間），造成蘇北第二，爲其軍事上之補助。</p>
<h3>長春實施臨時戒備　鄭洞國張元濱過瀋抵平　請軍調部制止東北紛擾</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕東北保安副長官鄭洞國，昨偕第三兵站總監張元濱及長官部第三處長劉伯中抵平，據鄭氏語記者，渠爲昨晨由長過瀋，謁前晚返瀋之杜長官有所請示後，原機來平，其任務爲親向軍調部說明共軍近在東北之調動紛擾與積極破壞交通情形，請設法制止，且蓋平，鳳城等縣民衆代表已請求國軍迅速予以收復，此亦將與軍調部商洽辦法。鄭氏十五日午曾應李宗仁邀宴，就關內外軍事問題交換意見。又據張總監元濱稱：東北數十萬國軍之冬裝，已至積極籌備時期，此行任務即在此，除與此間之第五補給區洽辦外，並將赴津一行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津十五日電〕據報載，長春警備部十四日晨召開緊急軍事會議，旋即頒發緊急命令，長春國軍無論官佐士兵，一律不准離開兵營。下午十一時後，停止一切交通，無論何人不准在外行走。戲院舞廳均經仔細搜査，午後各重要路口均派駐衛兵，並有武裝巡邏隊在馬路巡行。此項緊急命令及時特別警戒之有效期間為三日，自十五日起至十七日止。當局因據情報，共黨或將於三日內在長春引起大規模騷亂，故頒發此項緊急命令。又據另一長春電稱：政府飛機三架，昨晨飛過東北各重要城市，投下傳單，飛機自瀋陽出發，共產黨控制之哈爾濱亦有傳單投下。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕軍息；庫平。法庫間林彪部葉結萬餘人，有攻法庫企圖。海龍附近太平川戰爭仍激烈進行，海龍廿九小組美方。政府代表會往視察，仍未能消弭戰火。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國際干涉乎？人民公斷乎？</h3>
<p>—我們反對前者而主張後者—</p>
<p>政府與中共爭執不決，調處尙無成效，於是最近產生了兩種論調。中共高唱國際干涉論，中華時報則主張國共雙方應於此時聽取人民的意見，這是最高的公斷。本報十二日社論對於全國性的談話會更作具體的建議，自然是主張人民公斷的。今天我們更要說明反對國際干涉的理由。</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使與司徒大使聯合發表聲明之後，各方的觀感雖不一致；但是大家莫不認爲這是友邦調人向雙方發出的嚴重警吿，這雖說明和平談判已到了最後關頭；但仍切望雙方反省，咸能大澈大悟，以挽回國家的厄運。到了蔣主席前天發表文吿，鄭重宣佈其一貫主張，政治紛爭仍取政治解決方法，大家更以爲和平的前途，尙未到山窮水盡無路可走的困境。但是看看這幾天來中共的表示，實在令人寒心，使我們對和平的前途，又着實不敢樂觀了。</p>
<p>法國新聞社十二日南京電訊：『據可靠方面消息，中共代表周恩來今晨面告馬帥稱，在現行環境之下，如不能獲致和平，則將中國問題，提請聯合國安全理事會處理。同時中共發言人王炳南，也大言不慚，解釋中共主張將中國問題訴諸聯合國機構的理由，並謂英蘇旣爲去年十二月莫斯科三國外長會議宣言之簽字國，在中國和平談判中，自應處於與美國同等之地位。』合衆社十四日南京電，稱延安「解放日報」十三日發表社論，除了開始攻擊馬帥外，也以此爲言。這二段電訊，如果是千眞萬確的話，則我們不得不首先向讀者指出中共代表在其荒唐謬誤的論調裏，實包藏着卑怯，自私，惡毒的禍心。</p>
<p>在我國抗戰勝利結束之後，凡是黃炎子孫，愛國兒女，無不熱望祖國能早日完成統一與强大的偉業，不僅能光榮地生存於列國之間，而且還要能忠實履行聯合國憲章所規定的義務，以盡其維持世界和平的職責，堪稱四强或五强之一而無愧。但是抗戰勝利一年來的結果，這個全國人民共同的夢想，幾乎完全幻滅。不僅四强或五强之一的地位動搖，而且自己國內的事情自己不能了，還要勞動友邦的兩位調人，東奔西走，從中調處，十閱月來，調處尙未絕望，中共忽然異想天開，主張把自己的事情，請求聯合國機構處理。非把國家的體面與國格掃地不止，中共只知站在黨派的立塲上替一黨一己的私利打算，而不替整個國家的利益着想，這種倒行逆施的行動，不是自絕於國人嗎？</p>
<p>中共不願國家統一和强大，是顯而易見的，姑置勿論，我們若以國際公法的眼光，觀察中共的建議，也覺得幼稚得滑稽可笑。第一，聯合國機構，是一種國際性的組織，安全理事會的目的，乃在促進國際和平與安全之締造及維持，其方法更着重在循和平的途徑以解決一切國際爭端。對於各國的內爭，自無權處理，即使有一個國家，自甘墮落，欲將其國內問題訴諸安全理事會，也唯有爲各國所公認的唯一合法的中央政府，始能提出，絕非任何一方面均能向聯合國機構提出申訴。第二，安全理事會處理國際糾紛，因爲常任理事國可以行使「否決權」之故，能否爲和平解决國際爭執的有效機構，還是一個嚴重的問題，將中國問題訴諸聯合國機構，不但徒然浪費時間，而且更將增加國際的矛盾。第三，中國是安全理事會五常任理事國之一，如以自己國內的爭執提出討論，則中國在國際上所處的地位，將要一落千、丈，世界各國人民對於中國的觀感，更要不堪設想了。只有自甘墮落，自降國格的人，才會贊成這種無恥的主張。無怪中國靑年黨負責人要公開聲明反對了。</p>
<p>至於主炳南氏的談話，認爲英蘇在中國和平談判中，應與美國處於同等地位一層，他所依據的理由，也是似是而非的。第一，美國政府派馬歇爾特使來華調處國共談判，使中國早日造成和平統一民主的國家，是美國一貫的對華政策，並非依照三國外長會議的決議而出此。第二，中國並未出席莫斯科外長會議，對於中國問題所作之决定，在事前並未微求中國政府之意見，事後中國政府也沒有承認的意思？中國當然不接受這個決議的拘束。第三，美國調處中國和平談判，曾得中國朝野一致的同意與歡迎，而且英國政府早已聲明，不願調處中國內爭，我們爲什麼要强迫他國出面調處呢？第四，莫斯科外長會議協定中所公認的朝鮮獨立，至今未能實施，美國當局正表示不滿，還有什麼價値作爲干涉中國問題的根據？</p>
<p>要之，中共代表對於上述的理由，非不知之，實因其另有野心，質言之？就是中共千方百計，企圖爲國際干涉，開一方便之門，不僅欲使中國的國際地位降低，成爲無人重視的國家，而且還要使中國淪爲西班牙第二，戰亂不已；如此中共便可以混水換魚，爲所欲爲，以遂其一黨一己之私慾。所以中共代表在馬司聯合聲明發表乏後，提出這種荒謬的主張，不過是一種宣傳攻勢，企圖混淆國內外的視聽而已，並沒有實質的意義，根本上就沒有硏究的價値。我們希望：中共如果還有國家觀念，應該立即實行統編軍隊，恢復交通等方案，再不然，也儘可出席行將召集的廬山談話會，聽取人民的公斷，這纔是正當的途徑。</p>

<h3>王外長主持和會　芬代表出席陳辭　對蘇賠款額過鉅要求予以減少　盼從此能獲獨立生存穏固基礎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日廣播：和會於本日午前十時零五分賡續開會，由中國外長王世杰輪値主席三日。王外長以英語致詞後，捷克代表馬薩克繼起發言，說明該國對於匈牙利外長演說之意見。下午三點零五分（巴黎時間）和會續開時，芬蘭代表團被邀引入塲。芬蘭外長亨克爾繼起登壇發言，操流利法語，首向大會感謝准予發表意見，繼謂芬蘭素爲民主之前鋒，於簽訂停戰協定後，芬蘭人民立即對德宣戰，終將德人驅出國土，然係以慘重之犧牲換來者，芬蘭人民之眞正意志，於此可見。關於蘇芬關係，亨克爾謂：爲該部份歐陸之和平計，兩國實有永久合作之必要，芬蘭願謹愼實踐停戰協定，但芬蘭係戰敗國，在履行和約上，此時立即遭遇各種重大困難。芬蘭失去重要中心地弗利波里省之大部，佔地兩萬三千平方公里，大量居民遂須遷移他處，彼等在地面上之產物仍受損害，致使復興工作及債款之償付趨於遲緩。此外並喪失於芬人經濟生命有其特殊重要性之貝察摩區，及芬京赫爾辛基附近之包爾卡拉。因此等土地割讓之重要性，芬蘭希望和的內有關領土之條款約束，終能予以减輕。對於停戰協定影響芬人經濟生命各點，業已詳載送交大會之備忘錄內。芬蘭生產能力受兩次戰禍摧殘，對蘇賠款達三萬萬元之鉅，苟無外力支援，實感無力支付，且無力維持其國內生活水準及恢復其生產能力，因芬蘭難望一改善其對外貿易故也。亨氏希望賠款能減少一萬萬元，則履約之把握可能更大。芬蘭代表末對列强，例如蘇聯之德意，表示感謝，渠預祝蘇芬兩國民間永遠友善之道德從此開啓，同時希望給芬蘭以獨立生存之穩固基礎。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日廣播：古巴，即爾巴尼，墨西哥及埃及等國代表，將於本星期六全會內，被邀陳述各自之意見。</p>

<h3>匈外長發表意見　為少數民族請命</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕匈牙利外長喬査西今日繼保加利亞外長柯里希夫之後，在和會陳述意見，要求援救羅馬尼亞及捷克境內之匈牙利被壓迫少數民族。並稱，外錫爾凡尼亞割歸羅馬尼亞，匈牙利碍難承認。喬氏宣稱，民主的匈牙利，於戰亂中興起，特至今日，人權完全被置於不顧，無數匈人往往在數小時內被逐出捷克，僅帶隨身行李。斯洛伐克境內匈人約六十五萬人之公民籍及人類最基本的權利均被剝奪，其貨物則均被沒收。戰爭結束以來，羅捷境內一百五十萬以上匈人之際遇，令人感覺不安。主席貝爾納斯即令秘書長送匈代表團離席，捷克外長馬薩利克繼之宣稱，「匈外長此種驚人與空前演說，捷代表團擬加研究，明晨加以答復。先是保加利亞外長柯里希夫演說，要求希臘交還西色雷斯省，此項要求得烏克蘭代表馬紐斯基之擁護。希臘代表蔡爾達里斯立即加以駁斥，力言四國外長和約草案，對保加利亞尚欠嚴厲。</p>
<h3>世界婦女代表　要求參加和會</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕世界婦女平等權利黨之美國代表羅傑斯夫人，今日抵倫敦，要求巴黎和會准許婦女代表參加。夫人　各國婦女應在和會中獲得一席，婦女亦應對世界之未來具有發言權。</p>
<h3>對義和約　委會成立</h3>
<p>特港問題最感棘手</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十四日電〕對義和約委員會已於今晨成立。特里埃斯特問題，爲最困難問題之一，四强意見龐雜，對處置特港之辦法，莫衷一是。該委會尙須處理前義國殖民地與義國賠償問題，此等問題亦頗棘手，但不若特港問題之　　　　　　。</p>
<h3>法願與義大利　重樹友好關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日緊急廣播：法總統皮杜爾頃宣稱：法國希望與義大利重樹和平與友好之關係</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯演說　答覆蘇聯</h3>
<p>謂美絕無領土慾望　願助各國經濟復興</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十五日電〕美國務鄉貝爾納斯今日向和會發表顯然針對蘇聯之演說，略謂違反波茨坦協定而締結之經濟條約，將引起「奴化及冒險〕。同時，貝氏對蘇方所謂若干國家在戰時致富一節，表示不服。謂何一大國戰時致富乎？余斷然知悉未有一國。余希望蘇聯發言人並非指及美國公共貸出之十萬萬美元。美國在進攻之前，羅斯福總統即宣布美國將為民主之表徵，美國並未要求賠償，不過要求全體人類自由。美國亦不要求領土與賠償，美國現欲援助任何國之經濟復興。</p>
<h3>英蘇兩國陳兵邊境　伊朗軍實施戒備　蘇軍正集中奧迪薩港　對英抑對土用意不明</h3>
<p>〔合衆社德黑蘭十四日電〕中央政府軍一萬五千八，今日在卡士文實行戒備，因聞亞塞爾拜然之民主黨人正在該　之北一百哩地點集中。民主黨人集中之原因不明，但某方人士云，此係「預防不測」。由英駐伊大使召往德黑蘭討論英國對伊關係之英國總領事，業已返歸住所。自英國巡洋艦出現於波斯灣之消息於上月傳出以來，即盛傳蘇軍在亞塞爾拜然邊境集中。對於此等消息，旣無法證實，亦未獲否認。伊朗陸軍部長吿合衆社記者云，吾人對於當地情形，無法明瞭其眞相，因吾人與蘇聯——亞塞爾拜然邊境，並無直接接觸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社十四日電〕伊朗駐美大使艾拉今日宣稱：彼曾接獲蘇聯在伊朗北面高加索境集中軍隊之消息，惟所得報吿並未指示其集中軍隊之目的。此項軍隊或用以對抗英國在南部對伊朗所施之壓力，或因蘇聯提出直接控制韃靼尼爾之新要求，而對土耳其施行壓力？此舉已引起英國，伊拉克與伊朗三國間之嚴重局勢。此間外交界方面又盛傳，蘇聯已集中若干軍隊於黑海要港奧迪薩一帶，亦未知其目的何在。</p>
<h3>土耳其提覆牒　拒絕蘇要求　蒙德婁公約精神　簽字國不容違背</h3>
<p>〔聯合社伊斯坦埠十四日電〕消息靈通方面今日宣稱，蘇聯要求修改蒙德婁條約，俾將韃靼尼爾海峽歸由黑海各國共管，並由蘇聯與土耳其共同保護一層，土耳其政府已提出復文，堅決加以拒絕。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電」消息靈通方面稱，蘇聯致牒土國要求修正蒙德婁公約，土國之覆牒，對所稱土國於戰時違反公約之一節，已予以駁斥。蘇政府之照會指土政府於戰爭時期，曾允許德義巡邏船及輔助艦通過海峽進入黑海，實屬違反公約，故蘇聯認爲蒙德婁公約在戰時猶不足保特黑海之安全，必須予以修正，使蘇聯得與土國共同負責海峽之防務。公約第十九條確規定於戰爭時期，土國苟非交戰國，應不許交戰國軍艦通過海峽，故問題所在，乃爲軍艦之定州義如何。土國政府之覆牒，當指出通過海　之軸心國船舶，並非公約所稱之軍艦，該約附則第一章曾有軍艦定義之規定，係以一九三六年三月一日倫敦海軍條約之定義爲據。</p>

<h3>蘇聯政府公布文件　指責土曾與德勾結</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕蘇聯政府頃公佈前德外部檔案中抄獲之文件數種，證明土耳其曾與德國勾結，其其中一件爲前德國駐羅馬尼亞公使吉林述簽名之電報，提及德外次及土駐羅大使在羅京之談話。土大使曾聲明土國雖繼續嚴守中立，但始終認蘇聯爲大敵云，另有一種文件，涉及德國全權公使亨丁與前任土陸軍參謀長卓馬克所派特使加隆之談話，卓馬克表示土耳其與蘇聯間之衝突，殆不可避免，一俟土國軍備完成，戰事即將開始。土國之攻勢，擬經由伊朗高原，直撲巴庫油源。此外，前任德駐土大使巴本曾通吿德外部，謂卓馬克提議一部份土耳其公民熟悉高加索情形者，應遣往德國。另一方面卓馬克表示願將一部份高加索篇及亞塞爾拜然籍軍官革職，以順德國之意。卓馬克復吿巴本謂，蘇聯已在基塞奧姆斯克及多姆斯克各地完成各飛機廠，並在烏發油田裝就各種配備。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城十四日電〕土國政府在覆文中聲明，土國不能與少數國家簽訂新協定，以代替一九三六年之公約。要之，土國政府仍將遵守蒙德婁公約之精神，並認爲此乃管制韃靼尼爾海峽唯一的外交文件，不容違背云。</p>
<h3>美英聲明態度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕關於蘇聯對於韃靼尼爾海峽向土爾其所提出之照會，頃據芙外交界人士談稱，匪特美國不能接受，抑且蒙德婁公約其他任何簽約國亦不能接受。蘇聯所提出之建議，似已恢復至十九世紀之外交，其中甚至無隻字涉及聯合國云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕外部發言人宣稱，英國不能同意蘇聯採取任何步驟，以期蘇土兩國就海峽問題進行直接談判。此間政治觀察家認為英政府對於此軍，將取強硬態度，可於此獲一明證。</p>
<h3>美剩餘船隻　我購買獨多</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕海軍委員會宣稱，中國曾要求購置規定出售之一三八九艘剩餘商輪之最大部分一五九艘。</p>
<h3>對巴勒斯文坦問題　美提出折衷方案　英閣將召開會議討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕權威方面息：杜魯門總統已批准以代理國務卿艾克遜所建議之巴勒斯坦問題折衷方案，爲與猶太阿拉伯兩族討論之基礎美總統已將此一方案，直接送達英首相艾德禮，並謂苟能以此爲與猶阿兩族談判之基礎，則美國願意給與一道義上之援助。該計劃之詳細內容，一俟英閣成立決議後，即可宣布。據悉，該計劃仍贊成巴勒斯坦分治，但猶太省之區域，較英美專家原所建議者爲廣，且猶太省對於移民稅收等問題，亦有較大之自治權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕據消息靈通及負責之外務部人士談稱；杜魯門總統今日反對英美委員會設立巴勒斯坦聯邦制之計劃，因此，英國感覺巴勒斯坦問題，有另覔新解決辦法之必要。總統之照會中稱，美國未得人民擁護，暫時旣不能接受，亦不能反對此項計劃，英國以委任統治國地位，宜適應環境，出以賢明舉動云。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦恐怖行動</h3>
<p>非法移民不斷人境</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：巴勒斯坦恐怖行動益趨激烈，在十六小時內，巴勒斯坦郵政總局二次接到電話，聲稱不久炸彈將在郵政大廈爆炸，以致工作人員紛紛逃避，郵電交通斷絕一小時以上，但結果並未發現炸彈。其他機關亦接到類似電話。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷十四日電〕猶太事務局發言人頃宣稱：現有兩船共載非法移民一千三百人，另有一艘聞已駛近海發，待進入巴勒斯坦領海，將予扣押。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華沙十四日電〕波蘭外部發言人今日宣稱：自七月初以來，已有猶太人二萬五千名非法離開波蘭，波政府所發出境護照共四千七百六十四張。</p>

<h3>我檢察官當庭控述　日軍在華暴行　美各記者哥德昨續作證　馬金牧師談南京大屠殺</h3>
<p>〔改造社東十五日電〕去年今日爲日皇裕仁向今國廣播投降之日，當時在御前會議主張和平之東鄕前外相，及參謀總長支持陸相阿南之梅津大將，在此歷史性紀念日，均作階下囚，並肩列席於國際法庭之被吿席。前駐平美國記者哥德今日仍出庭作證，先述日方在北平·南京·蒙疆樹立偽政權經過，及經濟侵略情形。謂山西省內所有工廠，由日軍經營，其餘地方，在華北由「華北開發公司」，在華中則由「華中振興公司」一手包辦。繼即由我檢察官向哲濬氏操流利英語，論吿日軍暴行稱：余今欲論者，乃一般人之殘忍行爲，及反人道罪之一部分。其中包括殺人·虐待·强姦·刧掠·不法破壞等。日軍自一九三七年至一九四五年間，在中國淪陷區實行此種違反人通之罪行，其尤著者，即爲南京屠殺事件。日兵獲指揮官及東京首腦部之同意，而作此暴行，企圖永久消滅中國之抗戰意識，此乃日本式之作戰方法。其次日本又利用麻醉毒品，爲征服中國計劃之一部。要之，日本對中國之毒化政策，其目的在减低中國民衆之體力，削弱其抗戰力，及獲得軍事經濟侵略所需龐大費用。向氏陳述舉，即由一九一二年至四十年間居住南京之約翰，馬金牧師出庭作證，陳述日軍在南京姦淫鹵掠情形，謂日軍占領南京時，對市民所加暴行，實非言語所能形容。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十五日電〕國際法庭今日開始檢舉日閥之經濟侵略罪行。由美國作家哥德作證，略謂日軍在華北設立傀儡政府，恣意擄掠，制中國人民經濟於死命，辯護人羅　起立反駁，謂審判長魏勃曾於七月廿四日聲稱「經濟的侵略並非犯罪。」魏勃嚴厲答以「倘與侵略　聯　，當然犯罪。」按經濟罪為第四檢舉階段。宣傳行動，滿洲事件，及華北事件，業已檢舉畢事。檢察長季楠表示檢查將分為十二階段，大約至本年九月底可全部畢事。</p>

<h3>美國務院官員多人革職　外交官年俸增加　設立外交研究所訓練新人才</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕國務院今日發表貝爾納斯致衆院規程委會主席薩巴斯一函，聲明國務院中公務員與外國政府具有密切關係者，已有四十人被革職。外傳此項公務員因有共產傾向，共產活動　　共產黨員致被檢舉革職者，即使無數千人亦有數百人之多，實屬不確。貝氏函並稱：其他政府機關公務員調至國教院任職者共四千人，其中三千人已受審查，不能長期叙用者二百八十五人，其中亦已有七十九人被革職。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統今日簽署法令，將最高級外交官年俸，自一萬七千五百元增至二萬五千元，俾使美外交官致力爭取和平更爲有效。總統此舉爲美外交機關廿二年來最大之改革，此項法令並將低級外交官年俸增至一萬三千五百元。此外並規定仿照陸海軍軍官大學制度。設立外交研究所，訓練外交人才。使館隨員每隔兩年回國受訓一次，俾熟悉國內情形。外交人員成績不佳者予以革職。</p>
<h3>伊朗問題的史料</h3>
<p>— ——本報編譯室——</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰結束以後，伊朗問題始終成爲重要的國際問題。在今年一月間聯合國大會舉行的時候，英蘇兩國曾經爲着伊朗問題，展開一塲激烈的辯論，後來決定由蘇伊兩國直接談判。到了聯合國安全理事會開幕的時候，美英又將伊朗問題列入議程，以致引起蘇聯代表的退出會議，形成了聯合國的一個嚴重危機。</p>
<p>後來問題不了自了，現在事隔數月，伊朗局勢又趨緊張，原因是蘇英兩國都已陳兵在伊朗邊境，而伊軍亦出動戒備，茲將有關伊朗之形勢，資源及戰後種種事件，綜合叙述如左：</p>
<p>伊朗最古老的名稱是「安息國」，後來改稱　斯，至一九三五年三月二十一日才易今名。全面積有一百六十四萬三千平方公里，常戰前法國的三倍，略大於我國新疆，大部爲乾燥高地，除東部外，西北南三面都有山脈，東南沙漠綿亙，幾佔全境二分之一，僅西北境尙稱肥沃而已。伊朗的人口祗有一千五百萬，波斯人約佔全體的三分之二。</p>
<p>廣大的油田　引起了糾紛</p>
<p>伊朗每年出產很多現代交通工具必需的石油，在伊朗眞所謂石油遍地。當初在石油未經開發之先，伊朗人民都隨處採取石油，作燃燈炊煮之用。據最近估計，伊朗每年出產石油有一千三百萬噸，佔世界產量的第四位。</p>
<p>早在一九〇一年，一個在澳大利亞開金鑛致富的英人達西到波斯來探險，發現境內蘊藏大量石油，即於是年五月二十八日與波斯摩査法爾廷大王訂約，以二萬美元的代價租到了五十萬平方英里（佔全國五分之四）的石油權·一九〇九年緬甸石油公司購買了達西的石油發採權，組織英伊石油公司，於一九〇九年四月十四日註册，正式開採發售。英伊石油公司的資本完全是英國人的，後來因爲伊朗要收回油權，英伊發生紛爭，至一九三三年經國聯的調解，於是年四月二十八日改訂英伊油務商約，對於伊方的權利，稍予改善，一九三七年伊朗王又與美國訂了一個合約，將伊朋東部的採油權讓給美國。</p>
<p>第二次大戰以後，去年十一月，伊朗北部的亞塞而拜然人反抗伊朗政府，要求自治，於十一月二十日成立了國民議會，後來又成立自治政府，宣佈脫離德黑蘭的統治。</p>
<p>伊朗政府認爲自治的把戲，是受了蘇聯的指使，所以向安全理事會提出控訴，但在安理會未正式討論前，新任總理薩多泰納上任，訓令撤銷申訴，而聯合國大會，也決定把伊朗問題交給蘇伊直接談判。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表退席　問題不了自了</p>
<p>當蘇伊直接談判，英美看到蘇聯可能獲得伊朗北部油田區時，它們便就先後照會蘇聯，要求說朋拒絕自伊朋撤兵的理由。三月十三日美英通訊社並說蘇聯在伊朗大舉增兵，一方面向伊京德黑蘭推進，另一方面又向伊朗，土耳其，伊拉克三國交界處集中，中東的戰爭大有一觸即發之勢，但是這個謠言，立刻就被塔斯社加以否認。然而，美國的態度仍是非常强硬，對於蘇伊糾紛，表示將以全力支持伊朋。</p>
<p>當安全理事會已決定在三月二十五日在紐約開幕的時候，蘇伊談判正在進行中，而且伊朗北部的蘇軍於三月二日已作局部的撤退，蘇聯首席代表葛羅米柯因要求安全理事會自三月二十五日展期至四月十日開會，但杜魯門則於二十一日在新聞記者招待會上，堅決主張不能展期。三月二十三日，伊朗總理薩爾泰納突然打破以往的緘默態度，表示蘇伊問題可能在安全理事會開會之前獲得解決，以爲安全理事會不必急於討論蘇伊爭端。二十四日莫斯科電台宣布：蘇軍已於二十四日開始自伊朗撤退，可於五大星期內撤盡。斯大林也聲明。蘇伊問題「已因兩國政府之間獲致協議而完全得到解決」。但英國方面卻傳出消息，說伊朗似已同意蘇聯的要求，包括亞塞爾拜然自治，蘇聯得開發伊朗北部油田及擔保以後伊朗得效忠蘇聯。</p>
<p>蘇聯採取了這一舉動，由伊朗實行撤兵，蘇伊爭端照理可以循直接談判的途徑解決，但是美國却堅持把伊朗問題列入安全理事會的議程中。二十五日，安全會終於在紐約宣吿開幕，二十六日開會之後，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯要求不把伊朗事件列人議程，但被九票對二票否決。休會以後，葛羅米柯又再提議，如將伊朗問題列入議程，則延至四月十日舉行，但美國堅持此案應即受理，准許伊朗代表作口頭的陳述，於是，葛羅米柯便於二十七日大會上，宣布不能參加會議，述同代表團伺時退出會塲了。</p>
<p>英美于爲着打開僵局，乃商定展期至四月三日討論該問題，同時要求蘇聯與伊朗於四月三日，向安全理事會報吿：一·蘇伊兩國談判蘇車撤退問題，有什麽進展？二·蘇軍撤離伊湖，是不是以其他讓步爲條件。在這種情形下，問題不了自了，但是與蘇英同時兵迫邊境，問題又來了。</p>

<h3>改善交通辦法決定　行人一律靠右行走　中區熱鬧馬路規定單程交通綫　指定五處停車塲添置交通標誌　定九月一日起實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕由吳市長召集之第二次交通會議，昨日下午三時，在市府會議室召開，出席公用局長趙曾　，工務局長趙祖康，警察局副局長俞叔平，及黃浦，老閘·新成等各分局局長多人，關於本市之交通問題，昨日會議中有重要之決定如下：</p>
<h3>十項辦法</h3>
<p>（一）大會決定本市之單程交通綫不宜太多，現經決定之單程交通綫如下：（甲）南北單程交通（一）四川路向北行駛，（二）河南路向北行駛，（三）江西路橋因廢棄不用，南北交通未行貫穿，車輛減少，故可改成雙行。（乙）東西單程交通——（一）九江路向西行駛，（二）漢口路向東行駛。（二）決定單程交通綫中各種車輛之安排為：人力車須靠馬路之裏檔行走，三輪車在人力車之左側行走，機動車則在三輪車之左側行駛，汽車若欲超越人力車，必須自外檔行駛，以維持各種車輛之固定位置，又行人走於兩旁人行道上，亦須靠右行走。（三）指定機動車停車場，此項停車塲係向各估有團體或私人所租用，以後車輛必須集中在各停車場停留，可減少馬路中之擁擠程度。經指定之停車塲如下：（甲）中山東一路（即外灘）可停車二百輛至三百輛，（乙）蘇州路中國花園可停車二百輛，（丙）漢口路江西路口可停車七十輛，（丁）福州路河南路（現市府後之空地）可停車四十輛，（戊）河南路橋　可停車七十輛，上項停車場之利用，或將酌收相當費用。（四）規定載重車輛（老虎車，塌車等）之行駛時間如下：（甲）南京路等中區要道，上午八時至中午十二時，下午二時至六時不准通行，（乙）其他各路則上午八時至中午十二時禁止通行，因該各路中之擁擠情形，經考察結果，下午較上午為差。（丙）軍用卡車不遵守秩序，實為交通阻塞原因之一，現決定請憲兵三十三團，美軍軍部，警備司令部協助，一律執行交通紀律。（五）沿南京路之各交叉路口，決定劃分人行綫及停車先，使行人可安全穿越馬路，車輛犯規亦易識別，經決定劃綫之路口計八處：（一）南京路西藏路口，（二）南京路浙江路口，（三）南京路福州路口，（四）南京路由直路口，（五）南京路河南路口，（六）南京路江西路口，（七）南京路四川路口，（八）南京路中山東一路口·由單程交通綫之進出口添劃分道綫，經決定者有四川路·河南路·九江路·漢口路等·（六）加添交通標誌：各馬路上加添不准停車，停車處，單程交通之向南或向北等各種交通標誌·（七）添置交通信號：於重要路口添置紅綠燈，如四川路橋·天后宮橋·福建路·四馬路交叉口，河南路橋　等，須補充加添者共計十四處·（八）取締路旁攤販：於規定地區外，不准沿路設攤，即日起由警察局嚴格執行，規定罰　辦法如下：第一次罰款五千元，第二次罰款一萬元，第三次予以沒收。（九）整個交通計劃之執行方式：將由有關各局·公用局·工務局·警察局·黃浦·老閘各分局，推派代表兩人，為求辦事迅速起見，以電話通知各直屬機關執行，不再經過公文方式。（十）上項一切決議，決於九月一日起實施，然其間或將因受到各種物質條件的限制而告延期，但昨日會中，吳市長再三堅決表示，對於改善交通計劃的實現，刻不容緩，故公用局長趙曾　等已決定排除一切障礙，儘先予以實施，俾本市交通得以早日改善。</p>
<h3>接受工作清查團發表　查辦汪柱臣案經過　侵佔盜運物資證據確實　中央信託局有疏忽之嫌</h3>
<p>據蘇浙皖區敵偽物資接受工作清查團發表，查辦北海寗路十號日商長島修理廠汪柱臣侵佔盜運敵資全案經過如下：本團於七月廿七日接得密報，略謂本市北海寗路十號，原為日商長島修理廠，在抗戰期間，為上海規模最大之汽車修理廠，丙部遺留敵資甚多，去年勝利時，由淞滬警備司令部，上海市政府，接受敵衛物資管理處發封，今年五月間，該日商長島回國之際，突有汪柱臣者貿然接受，改頭換面而為新友公司汽車修理廠，並陸續將內部貴重物資用開車大批偷運，早已密告蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局，未見完全處理，故再為密報等情。</p>
<p>本國接報後頗為注意，正在研究徹查辦法之中，又連接第二第三兩次密報，謂該汪柱臣連日用開車搬運汽車胎約三四十付，油幫浦管子約二千二百餘只，大小汽缸床約二千餘只，克辣子藍林約四千三百餘只，汽車裏胎約五百餘只，又汽車零件一卡車，並仍在繼續偷運云云。本團以案情重大，經各委員會商決定，着手偵查，於是先向蘇州皖區敵偽產業處理局調閱全案卷宗，經審閱後，認該局處理本案，僅關於該廠之固定裝置之一部，已經轉由中央信託局加封，內部遺留之敵資，並未同時查究，加以處理，辦案不免疏忽，故隨時函向該局責詢。又查閱原卷內調查人員，已於六月廿日　報，何以遲至七月八日始函淞滬警備司令部轉知汪柱臣，將房屋交換武天祥，暨經查封，對於其他敵遺物又不同時加以注意與處理，縣有避重就輕之嫌。七月十九日武天祥催請將物資移去，又復延攔不理，迨八月六日本團清查時，始函中央信託局派員接收，本案承辦人員殊為延忽。故請該局一面制止走漏，一面追查被盜敵資及剩餘敵資之保管。同時張吳兩委員為慎重處理本案，復親自前往警備司令部訪問宣司令，查詢本案案情，其後又派專員會同蘇州皖區敵偽產業處理局承辦人員，經淞滬警備司令部治查，該汪柱臣並非該部職員，該部之檔案內僅為房屋問題，該部之檔案內僅為房屋問題，該汪柱臣曾向部請求代向房屋分配委員會聲請分配配房屋，以為修理汽車之用，又警備司令部亦經派稽查員化裝調查該汪柱臣走漏敵資情形，綜合各方面調查結果，該汪柱臣侵佔盜運敵資已可證實，故隨即函請虹口分局將該汪柱臣先行扣押，並於本案經過檢同文件，將全案卷宗函請上海地方法院檢察處依法偵查。</p>
<h3>函送法院·依法偵查</h3>
<p>逕啓者，迭據密報，略稱：去冬淞滬警備司令部接受北海寗路十號日商長島修理廠後今年五月間突由汪柱臣將該廠無條件接受，並利用　綱德日僑納粹份子多人，虛設股東，改頭換面，擴充營業，陸續偷運大批貴重物資籌備，報請澈查前來，據此，詳閱內容，案情重大，當經向蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局調閱案卷，復由張吳兩委員親往接收遺留該項地產經過，又派員會同敵偽產業處理局前往警備司令部閱卷治辦，如有必要，可先將該汪柱臣扣辦，均各在案。茲綜合調查結果，及敵偽產業處理局辦理本案情形，該汪柱臣確有侵佔盜運敵資重大嫌疑為防止繼續盜運暨澈底查明本案真相起見，除已函請上海市警察局虹口分局將該汪柱臣先行扣押，並分函蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局調查有關案卷，逕行轉達貴院外，相應檢同本案有關文件隨函送達，即請查照，依法偵查，並希將辦理情形見復為商。</p>
<h3>端納會見記　談到中國的戰事　大大的咳嗽起來</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「我剛到上海的時候醫生們都說我一定活不長，至多祗有一兩個月了，可是到了這裏之後，放開一切思慮，倒好起來了。」端納先生靠在臨窗的椅子上，膝蓋上攤開着一本專印給美軍看的「方本小說，」笑嘻嘻地這樣說。</p>
<p>端納先生的神氣的確好得多了，銀白的頭髮梳得很整齊，面色紅潤，精神也相當好。雖然說話時還是常要咳嗽，右手也還是常常撫着左胸，但是比起前一兩個月幾次拜訪他的時候，「咳陣」也已經減輕了不少。</p>
<p>他笑着說：「你們不是在報上說過，我是到上海來看「最後的一瞥」嗎？想不到你這次來看我，我倒還是很好。」我說大概從古到今醫生的話都不能看得大認真，要不然蕭伯納就不會這樣在戲劇裏常常和醫生開玩笑了。</p>
<p>端納先生忽然對我端詳了一下，慢慢地說，「你真覺得是這樣嗎？」</p>
<p>空氣有些沈重，我們就談政治。</p>
<p>提起了有人主張請英國來加入調停中國問題，他有些不相信，連問是那一家通訊社的消息。我說姑且不管這個消息確實到怎樣程度，萬一英國居然被邀請了，照他看來英國會不會出場。我說：「端納先生是深明中國情形的觀察家，一定有些意見。」</p>
<p>他說：「我在病房裏又能夠觀察些什麽呢？不過，為了一個土耳其問題，一個巴勒斯坦問題，英國大概也夠忙了罷？」</p>
<p>剛一談到中國目前戰雲瀰淺的情形，端納先生就大大的咳起嗽來！</p>
<p>空氣中盡是嗽聲，我想還是做些別的事罷—我就請他拍照。</p>
<p>我知道端納先生是不大願意照相的，然而昨天居然破例答應了。連看護小姐都驚奇起來，不信地說：「他今天答應拍照了嗎？</p>
<p>端納先生是一個極有決心的人，沒有決心他就不會在這樣病重的時候到中國來。「決心」在醫學上是能夠造成奇跡的，我希望這奇跡終於就克服了他的絕症！（圖即端納氏近影·本報攝）</p>
<h3>處理局接收房屋送清查團審查中</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖敵偽產業接收工作清查團，在滬展開工作以來，已接到密報百餘件之多，現正分別處理，關於蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局前後接收之房產，業經列具清單，送由該團審查中。又吳望　張慶楨兩委員，預訂週內親往查詢本市所接收之一一五六座倉庫，如倉庫之性質儲存何種貨物，未開封之原因，及研究發還何機關使用等項，均在調查範圍之內。又傳言該團將於本月廿四日截止接受密報一節，頃據張委員談稱，此事純係謠傳，本團在滬並無停止接受密報之事，則將來移往杭州等地後，亦將　　接受一般密報</p>
<h3>德僑所遺產業　交處理局清理</h3>
<p>本市德僑自集中居住，一部份德僑於上月遺送返國後，所有德置，凡由德僑管理委員會經辦各件，均已分別　　蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局德僑產業清理處專實處理。</p>
<h3>偽美鈔案續獲疑犯</h3>
<p>昨據記者自美軍方面獲悉：偽美鈔製造嫌疑犯五人，經美軍會同警備司令部捕獲後，當晚復有三人捕獲，其中五人係白俄·並悉，續有該案嫌疑犯二人，已為當局捕獲，現該案正在偵查中·</p>
<h3>原子筆所開支票不兌現</h3>
<p>關於原子筆開發支票是否有效一點，滬金融界頗為重視，曾托銀行學會代為研究，據研究結果，認為根據銀行規章，凡開發支票，必須中國毛筆或墨水筆，至於鉛筆，不得用以開發支票。按原子筆色澤，與複寫鉛筆相似，故應視同鉛筆，其用以開發支票者，不能付款，又不能於開戶時以原子筆簽具印鑒卡去云。本市銀錢兩業同業公會，以事關業務，并未預防支票流弊起見，昨已通函各會員，統一辦理。</p>

<h3>盜竊金磚案判決　陳元盛終身監禁　吳明剛陳有慶等分別處徒刑　金磚法幣依法全部追繳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行被竊金磚案，前經地緣審結，昨午十二時由鐘顯達推事升刑二庭宣判。主文：陳元盛連續侵占公有財物，處無期徒刑，　奪公權終身。吳明剛寄藏贓物處有期徒刑七月，陳有慶故買贓物處有期徒刑九月，施祥隆收受贓物有期徒刑五月，俞時揭寄藏贓物有期徒刑三月，王樹梅無罪。重量四百五十三兩餘之金磚一只，法幣五百三十五萬八千四百九十三元八角之支票一張，應予追繳。</p>
<p>主犯陳元盛昨衣格子紡短衫褲，平頭黑鞋。聞判低頭無言仍由法警押回監獄。其餘交保在外之被告，僅俞時揚一人到庭。</p>
<p>判決書理由</p>
<p>全文誌次：「訊據被告陳元盛對於犯罪事實，業經直認不諱。核與潘家　俞時揚等供述之情節相符，自足認為事實，應即依法論科。惟念先後侵占公有財物之動機，係基於拮据之意思而連續為之，則其行為雖有數個，仍應以連續一罪論擬。查被告任食於兄處，事當無憂，設能安分守已，寗至虧累。乃其性嗜賭博，復喜冶遊，月俸無多，而揮霍無度　益以投機失敗，遂生竊賣公物之機，此雖謂近乎勢迫，實乃自甘墮落。視於被告逃往杭州，又復慾情聲色，任意揮霍，其人性殊可以見。復查被告不甘貪貧，初則藉投機以圖大運，繼則連續盜占業務上管有之財物，審按情節，縣屬罪無可　。應予從嚴示罰，以儆來茲。至被告辯稱伊僅屬中央銀行之雇員而已。然被告既屬依法令重公務之人員，其屬公務員，無待詞費。被告以公務員身分而侵占公有財物，論以貪污之罪，自難謂須允當。再查其盜占之金磚一只，並五百三十五萬八千四百九十三元八角支票一紙，應倂依法向被告等追繳之。</p>
<p>吳明剛寄藏贓物部份</p>
<p>訊據被告吳明剛對於押受陳元盛竊盜中央銀行之金磚業不否認。惟辯稱：當時係由潘家　以電話談妥，由潘令上海市銀行營業科副科長楊德　　新大銀號經理王樹海連袂轉來。故不疑有贓物云云，惟查以資金為押款之舉，早經財政部明令禁止，復經財政部於四月間函至大公報聲明在案。被告明知銀錢業不得以黃金為押款，而竟貿然為之，已屬非是。況該金磚表而刻有滿洲國中央銀行之英文，不問而知此為接收敵偽之物。此類物資絕非通常之人所能持有買賣尤毋待言。乃被告唯利是圖，不惜甘　不諱，自屬罪無可這雖其辯稱當時並未拆陳紙包展閱，第查金磚之抵押非如普通之抵押可比，被告對於價值六千餘萬之抵押品竟不一展視而貿然收下，揆情詢非足信。日查被告與潘　家相　，而對諸王樹梅等則素無來往則其對彼等轉來之金磚必予拆而視之，以騐真偽。按諸一般交易情狀自復如是。被告雖斷口最解其非知情受押，第按之首開論述，殊非可採。顯被告份屬商人，乃因貪圖什一之利，遂而自蹈刑綱，酌情尙有可怒，　予從輕問擬，以示薄懲。</p>
<p>陳有慶故買贓物部份</p>
<p>查被告陳有慶對於本年五月四日由潘家　等為介買受陳元盛竊盜中行之金磚一只，業為其所是認。雖其辯稱並非知情故買，第查該金磚一只，業為其所是認。雖其辯稱並非知情故買，第查該金磚面上刻有英文滿洲國中央銀行字樣，一望而知為接收偽組織之物，誠非普通人所能持有與賣買，被告詭稱當時並未拆該金磚細視，以為其非故買之辯，顧買受該金磚價值七千餘萬，非同兒戲，必也審視周詳，辨別真偽，始而成交，被告明知該金磚非出賣者所能持有，竟予以承買，顯屬罪無可逃，視於被告買受後交付施祥隆　化，尤足證明，該被告確屬金磚為贓物，視而出此。蓋金磚之價值，在滬市能買受之錢莊銀號至夥，被告果需急用，自又轉售予人，　必即日交予施祥隆　化，審核情節該被告縣欲藉此以　滅其故買贓物之罪證，尤足據以認定，應予依法問題，以　來茲。</p>
<p>施祥隆收受贓物部份</p>
<p>被告施祥隆於本年五月四日收受陳有慶交付之金磚斷即為之　化，取得熔化之值七萬餘元，業如其所是認，惟其辯稱因未　英語，故不知該金磚為贓物而已，但查滬地為中外交易之樞，涉外貿易至夥縱一小店之學徒亦能操流利之英語，被告身為經理而謂不　英文自非可信，復查年僅卅五　而讀出身私塾，並未受時代敎育之陶冶，故未　英語等語，揆情亦非可採，查金磚為物既非普通人所能克有，而其上復有滿洲國中央銀行字樣，其屬國家接收偽組織之物昭然若揭，乃被告貪圖　化工資不惜收受為之　化，其應負收受贓物之刑責，殆無質疑。</p>
<p>俞時揚寄贓物部份</p>
<p>查被告俞時　於本年五月十八日為陳元盛審　統一丙種公債四包，票額計九十六萬元，事發後為中央銀行起回，此種事實其所承認，惟辯稱不知該物為贓物而已。惟查被告與陳元盛相識非誓，陳元盛之經濟狀況當其所　悉。蓋陳元盛不過中央銀行一助理員而已，寗來如許巨額之公債票，偶一推想即灼然如見，且查該公債四包均貼有中央銀行及陳元盛蓋章之封志，其非陳元盛個人所有，尤極明顯。被告明知是項公債票為中央銀行倉庫儲存之物，而竟為之寄藏，其應負之刑責殊屬無疑義，顧念其為友情所限，遂至　犯刑章，酌情當有可　，　從輕問擬，用示薄懲。</p>
<p>王樹梅搬運贓物部份</p>
<p>查起訴書認定被告王樹梅有搬運贓物罪嫌者，無非以被告本年四月廿四日承潘家　之　，代為出面立約，與重慶銀行上海分行裏理吳明剛締立貸款契約，當與楊德盛一同攜帶該金磚前往交付，不無搬運贓物之故意云云。惟據被告供稱當日承潘之邀為之出面立約，因有友人以黃金能押款，而重慶銀行則格於成例不能以私人名義抵押乃以被告開設之鑫大銀號為出押人，並不知該金磚為贓物等語。查被告所響各節核與潘家　所供略同，不無可信，而潘邀約被告為出押之舉亦未曾同該被告言及該金磚之來歷，跡其用意，無非利用被告之鑫大號謂出押者而已。至被告攜帶該金磚於途中並未拆視，且係陪同楊德盛前往亦據楊德盛供明，是該被告雖不應如是大意，然既無贓物認識則其攜帶該金磚前往則慶銀行交付，要不能論以搬運贓物之罪，此外亦無其他確據足以證明被告有犯罪之事實，按之認定犯罪以發見其貫實為主旨之法例，自未便　予論罪。</p>
<p>基上論結，合依刑事訴訟法第二九一條前段，特種刑事訴訟條例第一條第一項，懲治貪污條例第三條第二款第七條，刑法第三四九條第一項，同訴訟法第二九三條第一項判決如主文。</p>

<h3>趙迺傳談　北大法學院近狀</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕北大法學院代理院長趙迺傳，頃就該院近况對記者談稱：該院共分法律·政治·經濟三系。社會系則歸文學院，此系有如心理系，有列入文學院者，有列入法學院者。法律系主任爲燕樹棠，政治系主任爲錢端升，經濟系主任由趙兼任，三系敎授，陣容堅强。經濟系即有十位專家，已定者有八人，財政學家秦贊，貨幣銀行學專家周作仁，統計學家楊西孟，經濟史專家周炳琳，經濟理論方而趙迺傳，會計學家宋作楠。法律系敎授十人，政治系七人。學生方面，政治系二五〇人左右，法律系二〇〇人，經濟系則達四百餘人，加上新生，法學院將達千人。現在北大紅樓，將爲文法兩院分用。趙氏繼稱：法學院着重學術上之硏究，雖有政治系，但讀書時不准有政治活動，將使學生多作讀書報吿，建立學術上之基礎。關於法律系問題，趙氏特別提出法律課程，非增長畢業年限，不足以在法理上有所收獲，至少要六年，故渠主張成立法律方而獨立學院，如此政治經濟成爲政經學院，是乃符合最近在京舉行之高等敎育會議決議之意見。</p>

<h3>戰時儲款照千倍還付　公債黑市又生風浪　統內最高漲到一千七</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公債昨漲風突起，四行儲蓄會存款事，醞釀已久，現已經法院判決以千倍發還，引起各方注意，再經過業中大戶煽動，業外游資又被吸引而來，買氣忽濃，統丙自九〇〇元起，求過於供，中途突漲到一七〇〇元，業中多頭獲利了結，高後見回，惟因散戶不時維持，中途大事掙扎，終以前途虛幻，回跌至一二〇〇元左右，而後吿平，結果較前收激漲五〇〇元，甲乙升二九〇元，丁種漲四一〇元，戊種亦好四八〇元，按政府發行公債與銀行吸收存款，是否可以併爲一談，實有特別注意之必要。茲將最近法院判決陳季琳控吿四行儲蓄會一案，始末經過，分誌如下：</p>
<p>通貨膨脹後　儲款受損失</p>
<p>戰事期問，幣值頻跌，一般銀行之定期存戶，以格於期限，無法運用存款，待到期結算本息，所得法幣之絕對數額，雖較存款時增加，然該筆存款內在之購之力，實僅存款時數千分之一。買行究應予定期存戶以幣値貶跌銀補償乎，抑仍照原本息結付，此一問題，早爲一般人討論之中心。最近該問題因本市已有法院涉訟案件之發生，而更引起金融界之關注。</p>
<p>陳季林控告　四行儲備會</p>
<p>緣有陳季琳者，於民國廿九年五月六日，以法幣二千元存於四行儲蓄會，作爲五年長期儲蓄存款。該項存款，已於卅四年五月六日到期，尙未結算本息。茲陳氏以在此六年期中，社會經濟發生劇變，生活指數約增四千倍，如仍依原數給付，顯失公平。故向法院提起訴訟，認爲依據復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條之規定，及司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，被吿應負有增加給付之義務，要求被吿對原吿二千元之存款，及其利息，應依三千倍增加給付。</p>
<p>法院判決照　一千倍給付</p>
<p>法院判決主文：原告存於被吿處之長期儲蓄存款法幣二千元及其利息，應由被吿以一千倍增加給付。法院判決此案理由之要點有云：原告以約定五年之長期儲蓄，於到期後又未結算本息，在此長久之戰爭期內，經濟情形變動極　。旣非原吿所應負責，亦非原吿當時所能預料。根據被吿所援引之條例及司法院解釋，對被吿應負增加給付之責，自屬可信。惟以被吿於收受儲蓄存款後，固將一部份存款，作爲流動資金，其餘存款，或購公債，及其他債券，作爲担保，或投資於房地產，以資穩固，其後將收入之資金，爲多方面之活動與利用，縱公債因財政部照票面還本辦法之影響，而蒙受相當損失外，在其他方面之投資，莫不大增其貨幣之數額，自應使負增加一千倍之給付，以維公平。</p>
<p>增減給付規定　銀行亦當適用</p>
<p>又法院認為司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，及復員後辦理民事訴訟，補充條例第十二條，對於增减給付，爲普遍應用之規定，關於銀行方面，旣無除外之明文，自應加以適用，且被吿所提出財政部之辦法，係對於僞儲券及法幣折合並支付之辦法，亦無不准銀行爲增加給付之規定。且財政部縱有與該條例抵觸之辦法，在司法立塲上，亦無加以適用之餘地。而銀行因遝用儲戶之資金，可獲得鉅利。儲戶則因長期之凍結，而坐視貶値。苟不依例增加，豈可謂平。據上論法，本件原吿之訴，爲一部有理由，一部無理由，應分別准　，合依民事訴訟法第七九條，判決如主文。</p>
<p>金融界認為　影響太嚴重</p>
<p>記者　以此事徴詢金融界之意見，渠等認爲此一問題，影響及於一般金融界，性質殊爲嚴重。而政府對戰前定期存款，銀行究應如何償還一節，迄無辦法規定，今法院對定期存款，又有判決加千倍給付之事實，實使各行莊莫所適從。渠等認爲銀行之放款及存款準備金等，迄未較戰前增加倍數。而財政部對戰前公債，已照原値給付。中央儲蓄會淸理舊有儲蓄存款，亦按舊値計算。故對法院此一判案，表示不能接受云。</p>
<h3>判決書中兩項重要參考條文</h3>
<p>（一）司法院三〇一八號解釋要旨</p>
<p>存款於銀行，係以保管金錢之價格爲目的。其契約之性質爲消費寄託，所謂保管金錢之價格，乃指保管金錢在法律上之價格而言。以銀幣或法幣存入者，銀行以數量相同之法幣返還之，雖其法幣在經濟上之價格低落，亦不得謂爲違反保管義務。惟法律於其返還義務之範圍有特別規定者，仍不得以其未違反保管義務而排除其適用。消費寄託，依民法六百〇二條，適用關於消费借貸之規定，非常時期民事訴訟補充條例第十一條第二十條第二項，旣於消費借貸返還義務之範圍設有特別規定，則於請求返還存款事件自不能排除其適用。銀行放款本係消費借貸，請求返還放款事件，亦可按此項特別規定辦理，院解字第二八八五號解釋未便變更。</p>
<p>（二）復原後辦理民事訴訟補充條列</p>
<p>第十二條規定原文</p>
<p>法律行爲成立後，因不可歸責於常事人之事由，致情事變更，非當時所得預料，而依其原有效果，顯失公平者，法院應公平裁量，爲增减給付或變更其他原有效果之判決。</p>
<h3>金鈔堅定</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續疲軟，欲漲乏勁，晨開一九五萬光景，高價一度回升至一九五萬六，但不久即有脫手之流，買戶觀望下，逐步微降，十時後央行配給六七條，價降爲一九四萬，此後人心不振，錢兌業亦有斬售，午刻回跌至一九三萬五，而後稍平，午後形勢稍穩，美鈔方面頗多助力，稍有回升，結果仍較前收低二千，飾金紋銀均無變動，銀元微降，暗拆銀根泛濫，暗息自九分至一角二分不等。</p>
<p>外幣續趨鬆落，美鈔晨開二五六〇元有售，開後逐漸由平趨鬆，金市步降，缺乏聲援，午刻下降至二五四〇元以下，午後略有購貯備用者，稍吿回升，結果較前收微升五元，港票平穩多盤，喊價自六六八元中度低至六六〇元，最後仍站六六五元左右，結果較前收微落一元，港滙因申電報長至一八一元半，昨五五二元有售，印匯六六三元，英匯八八四〇元有供，美匯仍無變化。</p>
<h3>十萬包粉產量　實銷僅三萬包</h3>
<p>公會再請準予出口</p>
<p>目前本市麵粉生產過剩，第四區麵粉業公會，曾向糧部請求運銷外埠，或由糧部收購，糧部以係奉宋院長電令，不准報運轉口，且上海民食，尙未脫緊急時聞，麵粉仍應禁止轉口，至禁止小麥轉口，現時無此必要，麵粉業公會，以此辦法如不變更，此次麥貸難免不受虧累，麥貸大成問題，特再懇四聯總處轉呈政院　部，於最短期間禁麥轉口，或解除粉禁，據麵粉業中人談，原麥可以出口，價格必然上漲，麵粉禁止運銷外埠，則銷路呆滯，價格必然下跌，上海市塲，每月實銷不過三萬包，而生產數量，則超過十萬包，且有洋粉陸續進口，已達卅萬大包，實麵粉業之一大威脅。</p>
<h3>外商登記　未及半數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局自舉辦外商公司商號登記以來，截至七月底止，外商公司已登記者十八家，商號三百四十餘家，約計本市洋商公司行號，在一千家以上，現尙不足半數云。</p>
<h3>卸貨太慢費用太大　洋輪不灣上海說</h3>

<p>海味向榮</p>

<p>茶葉市况，內銷賡續不衰，洋莊茶市，英印兩莊仍有活動，婺源新抽珍由安和洋行吸進廿八箱，價每担創廿三萬元高峯，比上日飛升萬元之譜，此外裕隆洋行進陳特貢一百六十四箱，午昌茶葉公司購進陳中祁門卅七箱，又陳針眉七十二箱，大德昌茶葉公司蒐羅白琳陳紅茶五十祖，其他花色，各有做開，又悉，上週怡和，協和等洋行曾紛紛派員赴杭州搜購紅綠茶以來，刻下業已回滬，據云，彼地存底亦稀若晨星，且貨方索價漫無止境，一時不易收買，是以注視力復又轉移本市云。</p>
<h3>桐油出口問題　關鍵在於運輸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕桐油向爲我國出口貨之大宗，抗戰期間因交通阻塞，生產萎縮，勝利後情形仍未改善，出口方面向以美國爲銷貨尾闆，但因目前南美所產桐油價格較國貨便宜，同時美國方面已發明蓖麻油製成之代用品，故國貨頗受影響，惟我國桐油質地較優，是以仍能保有一部份銷路，最主要之問題仍在如何增加生產及便利運輸，現經營桐油出口貿易者有中國植物油廠，該廠自勝利後至現在止約共輸出桐油一萬噸，每噸二十担，每担價格國幣七萬元計，總値約爲一百四十萬萬元云。</p>
<h3>秋收　米榖豐稔　棉菸減色</h3>
<p>浙江沿錢江南岸棉田，本年收成減色，現採棉季節已臨，棉農苦無以保本，菸葉已採收完竣，收　最較上年減三成，惟沿浙贛綫之產米區，本年收獲甚佳，較上年高出二三成，是以近日來自金蘭以迄諸曁，米價大跌，新米每石僅二萬五千元，聞贛省新稻收成，尤較浙省爲豐。</p>
<p>許州菸葉近有兩萬包抵滬，菸葉價格已見疲軟。</p>

<h3>游資規避·空頭活動　華股趨勢仍然疲弱　外股市場買氣驟盛</h3>
<p>華股旣無大戶鼓動，更加空頭肆虐，如大厦之將傾，游資漸有規避之勢，各股依舊盤旋而降，晨高午低，中途高價永紗六六〇元，美亞三六九〇元，景福二一三元，新光二一〇元，勤興一五八元，近午低價永紗六三五元，美亞三四五〇元，景福一九五元，新光一九〇元，勤興一三五元，午刻轉呈徘徊，生意淸淡，息價减爲七分半至一角〇五·期貨反低於現貨四元，市况冷落可見一斑，較冷之中小型，亦被帶小少許，元老股平疲，趨勢未能樂觀，結果較前收計永紗美亞微降，景福等三小熱亦降落半成不到，較冷各中小型股微挫，元老股平平。</p>
<p>外股昨買氣忽盛，華股方面有游資見賤吸收，大戶如大康成等吸納頻仍，洋商買胃頗健，怡紗自七千七升至八千七，而後略回，英聯自七千九步升至八七五〇元，其他各股亦被帶上，外商對業成吸收較殷，勢已好轉，結果校前收計紙業獨好一成强，怡紗英聯回升一成，、業廣會德豐亞洲鋼業各升半成，怡啤雖升而不多。</p>

<h3>美國新棉花　不再管制說</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕或問一九四六年之棉花收成，是否亦在新物價管制法案下受限價之限制，物價管制局官員頃作答復稱，彼等認爲此事在新物價法案中，實爲違法之舉，故不擬加以限價之管制，並云一九四七年棉花落花生等收成之交易分配量及地畝指定額應予禁止之法案，業經杜魯門總統簽署云。</p>
<h3>紗布實銷疲滯</h3>
<p>昨日紗市疲莫能客銷仍在呆滯中，同行意興蘭　，暫不作榮辱觀，大型雙馬回降兩三萬，中小型亦疲一萬之譜，惟紡建出品廿支各牌尙稱穩定，緣有小織廠略有選貿也。</p>
<p>坯布趨勢轉平，因紗市回挫，實而不暢，所以人心又見軟弱，嗶嘰紡建公司開售繼續不斷，且有巨量供給，籌碼充斥，市盤向下，跌七百五十元，惟民營廠之坯布，南方搜羅殷切，市態仍站原地，紡建照例開售，市盤略小。</p>
<h3>糖價在上展中　第九期已配竣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據社會局經濟行政處第二科發言人稱，第九期食糖今已配售完竣，爲解除外埠糖荒計，社會局已決定下期食糖將專配給與外埠，第十一期則仍恢復配給本市糖商。</p>
<p>昨糖市中砂白以公司旣乏配售，僅恃福建溫州兩帮號家來貨，確屬有限，故市價仍在上展中，開開價升三四千元，其他如興化白亦隨緊，上　開十四萬二千元，次之十三萬八千元至六千元，成交百餘　，汕頭帮開出提靑九萬五千元，冲提靑九萬四千元至三千五百元，成交四百餘包，公司配與行方之生砂赤，定價爲七萬元，數量大約三萬包。</p>

<h3>臺灣農業試騐所　本報八日臺北航訊　特派員江暮雲</h3>
<p>以農業試騐爲中心的台灣省農業試騐所，是全省許多研究所中具有規模的一個，它擁有十個試騐支所，遍佈全省，包括了園藝，茶葉，畜產，熱帶農業等部門，日本人將台灣殖民地化，在有着五十年歷史的農業試騐的深度上，也可以明顯地看得出來。接收時該所共有三三二人除了八主位本省人以外都是日籍人員，現在他們留用着六十七位日籍技術人員，雖然新從外省補入四十餘人，要是這些日本人本年回國以後，高級硏究人才的顯然感受缺乏，而不能不多方向國內羅致了。</p>
<h3>八種新品種　都比臺灣稻種優越</h3>
<p>台省大都屬於亞熱帶，四季都可以栽植作物，水稻在北部年可二作，日本人將原有組放農田逐漸擴展爲集納農田，爲了使土地經濟使用，便研究採用了水田輪作制度，同時可能有水稻，甘蔗，及馬鈴薯，亞麻等三種作物並種，這類作物的品種，是由該所育成和供應的。益因戰時日本食糧大量需要，嘉義試騐支所更搜集了全世界的甘諸三九九種育成了三〇種的改良種，推廣全省以往原有本地種平均僅得藷乾27％現可得36％以澱粉含量言，改良種26％，本地種1717％很有利於發酵工業。日本人愛吃蓬萊米，他們在數十年中育成了八種新品種，品質和產量，都比本地品種優越，現在還有三種在各地試行栽植。</p>
<h3>兩種特效藥　繁殖起來特別困難</h3>
<p>給農藝系作爲試騐的農田有千餘畝，記者由季景元先生導引着在第二期稻作已完畢的試騐塲裏踏査。他說：該系是總所的主要骨幹，現在試騐中的較少，大部是着重在品種保存。纖維作物中被保存着的有黃蔴七五種，苧蔴六〇種，油料作物被保存的品種落花生六五種，胡麻二一種，向日葵十餘種。藥用植物肺病特效藥的玉咲葛藤（參看圖片）和紅頭藤，都是野生在砂質土壤的高山之巔，圓形的地下莖可以提煉活療結核病。移植在平地上需要强烈的陽光，高溫度，乾燥，雨量又要多，更需要用架子將藤扶起，因爲不易結子，而結子後又難於發芽，所以繁殖很少的。還有可以提煉治療腎臟病的Kumis　Kuelin，國內已普遍研究的毒魚藤和廣東薯榔三種殺虫藥劑的品種也被保存着。</p>
<p>我們特別參觀農其陳列室，沒有特製的機器農具，僅有通用的打稻機，用鐵絲做針，比較國內用鐵釘做的，稍勝一籌而已！據季先生說：現在祗不過做保存品種的工作，但最近也成了問題因爲缺乏肥料！日本人研究了豐歉年度預測器，根據天時雨量等的綜合預計，而製成儀器，已經十二年，現在還沒得到結果！</p>
<p>嘉義農業試驗支所　（本報資料室）</p>
<h3>五種大毒虫　調查硏究實行撲滅</h3>
<p>有百餘種的害虫，給水稻以莫大的威脅，螟虫類，浮塵子，鐵甲虫，負泥虫及椿象。這五大害虫，最厲害時，可使稻作完全沒有收成。螟虫普通年約被害3％至5％，浮塵子發生在九，十月降雨少的年份，鐵甲虫和負泥虫，發生於二期和一期作的初期，約減少收獲二三成。黑椿象和蜘蛛椿象都足以侵害稻莖，吸收養分使之減收　以上。</p>
<p>有四四種害虫侵蝕甘　，爲害最大者是擬蟻象鼻虫，甘諸根塊被侵害後發生惡具，甚至全部歉收。果樹及蔬菜的害虫中，對於外銷農產有關的是，侵食柑橘檬果實，在本省閩粤等地分銷頗廣的蜜柑小實蠅和侵害瓜類的瓜類蠅，這美國植物檢騐上對它也很重視的。</p>
<p>這些害虫，過去十年間用誘蛾燈調査螟蛾的殺虫數發生狀况等，曾作統計學的硏究，現正整理預測螟蛾發生的資料。目前更就螟虫對於稻作，擬蟻象鼻虫加害甘露的藥劑防治法，進行着研究。茶樹藥劑撒佈影響的試騐，蔬菜害虫，胭脂介壳虫的繁殖，虫敵（天敵）等的調査都在進行中。</p>
<p>在農化室裏，一位國內來的技術員對甘諸的黑斑病和從凝固的澱粉裏的有效成分作分析研究，他說最近準備完成鐵維純化的化學分析。</p>
<h3>海南島豬種　皮薄味美繁殖力強</h3>
<p>本省的畜產，日就頺廢，主要的畜產是猪，產額僅次於米，糖。全省飼養數最高達一百八十萬頭，平均每一農戶飼猪四·五頭，年屠宰數約一百二十萬頭，可是現在只有三十至五十萬頭，這種銳减，是決定於飼料缺乏管制不嚴和政府的沒有獎勵！</p>
<p>據畜產系的李棟樑先生說，世界上最優良的品種，大多含有亞細亞系的血液，可是這特點常被人忽視着。他們現正就南方一帶的猪種作調查研究，希望獲致亞細亞猪種而選擇改良，工作的對象，就是海南島猪。</p>
<p>（一）改良合灣猪種，以本省桃園猪和英國盤克縣Berkshire猪級進育種至第三代，然後行近親繁殖，固定它的性能，同時選擇淘汰而畜成一種純黑色與桃園猪相同，體型近似盤克縣猪的猪種，（參看圖片）現在還沒確定它的優點，不能推廣。</p>
<p>（二）研究海南島猪種，它的體型特異，耳小背凹腹垂骨細腿短，頸背皮毛黑色，腹部和四肢則作白色，額部多具有白色的三角星，它屬於亞細亞系，中國小耳花猪種，味美皮薄，繁殖力强，是中型的脂肪式猪種，現在他們正繼續研究，將來可能成爲華南一帶最優秀的品種之一。（參看圖片）</p>
<p>爲猪工作了十四年的日人蒔田，他領導記者爬上山坡參觀他所設計的猪舍，和畜產加工製品火腿，醃肉，臘腸及利用家畜內臟所製的肝粉和腸衣。當他以一串白色而輕薄如紗的腸衣出示時說：「中國每年從美國輸入大量的腸衣，這製作法該趕快改進啊！」</p>
<p>在民三十年，日本人配給每人肉食十三兩，後來改到一兩，光復後取消了配給，我們現在正吃着全國最高價的肉，每斤九十六元臺幣，蒔田說：「這怕是缺乏管理的結果！」</p>

<p>盼望蘇州電廠　設法輸送盡電</p>
<p>編者先生：古老的蘇州，一切事業牛步化。自勝以來，較能使人滿意者，要推鐵路當局。在敵僞時期之乘火車，處處人使感覺頭痛，今則一掃而光，行旅稱便。但電廠當局，自從敵僞手中接收以來，反停送日電。致原有工廠，相率被迫停閉，失業者因以增加，迭經有關工商各界，奔走請願，而該廠則未聞有改善之議。以視申錫兩地之電流畫夜無間，能不令人羨煞！近聞上海燃委會當局，對于蘇州方面之配給煤量，已有相當之增加，而電廠當局，按月仍向工廠方面收取煤代金，其價格則依照黑市，致電力電價，高出電燈電價數借。各工廠已出鉅大代價，竟不能充份利用。按蘇垣在事變前，擁有大小工廠五百家，均藉電力以爲原動，中經八年離亂，亦小有進展，工廠總數已將八百。自去歲勝利以迄今日，已復工者不及二百，且均須在下午二時即電廠開放電流時起開始生產，而在下午八時至十時又由電廠當局，自動將電力電流停止，移供燈用。若長此以往，蘇地現有工廠，勢必復歸伴閉。蘇州電廠當局，旣負一邑生產原動力之重責，尙盼早爲設法改善，曷勝盼禱！（圖存）</p>

<p>旅館業驚人漲價</p>
<p>編輯先生：這一次旅館業漲價六成，無形又作物價上漲的先鋒。現在各物已開始步跌，何以旅館業單獨上漲，眞令人費解。鄙人係公務員之一，自四月初來滬，因無法租得房屋，搬住新閘路一間旅館，當時租金每日三千零六十元，僅估我所入三分之一。到現在未及四個月，竟加到每日九千四百二十元，把我全月所入，尙不足供給房租。回憶戰前我所住的房間，每天不過八角錢，而眼前漲上一萬多倍，可不是驚人嗎？試問食米頂貴，也不過比戰前漲上六千餘倍，這一點要請當局切實注意。不要以旅館業漲價爲看不見的，任他漲價，因爲現在旅館所住的旅客，多數是公務員，而且一部份還是從解放區逃出來的，都是苦不堪言。此外，每一業漲價，和其他各業，都有聯繫關係，不要忽略了，就是造福社會不淺！（陳一醒）</p>
<h3>蘇北這盤棋</h3>
<p>— 本報十日揚州訊　特派員杭舟</p>
<p>蘇北目前的形勢像一盤棋，下棋的，一方是國軍，一方是共軍。</p>
<p>在廬山與南京不絕如縷地進行着談判，蘇北問題是其中主要的一節。政府方面以蘇北接近京畿，要求共軍撤至隴海路以北。共產黨會不會放棄蘇北呢？這是人們焦急着的問題。現在談判還沒有什麽結果，一個在蘇北靜靜地觀棋的人，則對於局勢可能的發展，已經瞭然在目。</p>
<p>我們先看共黨。</p>
<p>共黨在蘇北，軍事割據，政治，經濟所謂「革命」，已爲世人所稔知。但我們必須再度指出的是：中國共產黨不是一個像它自己所說的「爲人民謀福利」的政黨，而是十十足足的一個以「奪天下」爲志的暴力集團。當東北多事的時候，它便要奪東北；當京滬可以乘隙窺伺的時候，它還曾作過嘗試。因此，要它把蘇北吐出來，無異要割它的肉。</p>
<p>共產黨所標榜的是一套前進的馬克斯的共產理論，它行動所表現的則和古舊的草寇沒有兩樣。廿世紀五十年代是科學的羣衆時代，人民所服膺的是眞理，而不屈服於暴力。我們看共產黨的份子，便會覺得那眞是中國的災星！</p>
<p>中國古時代有農民揭竿起義的事，使共產黨響往不已。因此，它所嘯聚的便是做着這樣「英雄夢」的份子，不管三七廿一，要從馬上得夭下。於是，它第一培養的是武力。抗戰八年，它足足招了八年的兵，買了八年的馬。抗戰一勝利，它更發了一注橫財；道有國軍鹵獲的共方文件爲證：</p>
<p>「日本已無條件投降，僞軍僞組織人員處理辦法，本部奉軍令部如下命令：對所有自動向我投降反正的偽軍僞組織人員，一律施行以下三大保證：（一）保證反正全部官兵生命財產的安全；（二）保證部隊不編散，不解除武裝；（三）保證原有的官職，不剝奪兵權。」</p>
<p>這文件由共黨華中軍區第一軍分區司令部及政治部曁第一行政區專員公署會銜。</p>
<p>試想：共產黨是這樣的分子組成，它能爲人民謀什麽福利？能爲人民爭什麽民主？蘇北——這在共黨砧板下輾轉呻吟的羔羊已經訴盡了人間的憤怒！</p>
<p>政府當局對於這一事實不能漠視無睹。政府要求共軍撤出蘇北，不但在爲京都的安全，亦爲了要解救蘇北人民於水火之中。</p>
<p>但政府不能像共產黨一樣隨便使用武力，因此苦心孤詣地要以政治方式來解決共黨問題——蘇北問題自是其中之一。</p>
<p>可是政治方式不能解決問題怎麽辦呢？讓局勢一直拖下去嗎？明令聲討嗎？</p>
<p>我認爲都不會的；因爲國軍正在不動聲色地下這盤棋。</p>
<p>棋子已經排好了，幾隻子一動，局勢便有一個初定。看棋的人一下便明白，國軍雖處在被動的地位，但棋高一着，對方無能爲力，而且有全盤動搖之勢。</p>
<p>最近局勢沉寂下來，棋盤上只見一兵一卒的進退，似乎無關緊要，却正是戰略的運用。</p>
<p>國軍的車馬砲都按在適當的位置上，這對於對方是一種使之顫慄的威力，不但進攻的棋子會有殲滅的危險，全軍亦有覆沒之虞。一僩手段不高明而不失爲懂棋的下手，應該知道適時撤退爲上策；而那位高明的棋手不必追擊，便可贏得這一盤棋！</p>
<p>蘇北行之三</p>
<h3>「天堂」的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 本報十日杭州訊　記者黃行天</p>
<p>本月五日，靜靜的杭州城裏發生了一件聳人聽聞的悲劇，給茶樓酒肆裏的閑客多了一個閑談的資料。原來有一個年僅廿三歲的江西鄱陽巨富之汝在金玉，因不願受後母的虐待，便和她底熱戀的同學黃寳和，携帶箱籠珍物十四隻，實行私奔，乘船經樂平，屯溪等地來杭，希望在此「天堂」裏樹立一個美滿幸福的小家庭。</p>
<p>可是船抵江干，黃寳和突然帶了價值一千四百餘萬的箱籠十二隻，以先去覓屋為由，自行登陸他去。痴心的汪金玉，等了他六小時，還不見回來，祗好讓船夫領到西湖飯店住宿。汪女旣失情郎，又失財物，　憤已極。住了兩天，在龍翔橋結識了賣唱的陳少雲，陳王氏與西湖船伕任天福，阿康四人，邀住其家，發現汪女僅存之兩隻小皮箱中，猶藏巨款。四日晚，約汪金玉在西湖上蕩漾，介紹一友，說可代找同鄉，次日晨，即偕其友人李永昌至，說是已經找到了，便携帶汪女的小皮箱同往。不料行至英士街岳王路口，就分別乘車逸去。汪金玉叫喊無援，徒失金戒五隻，法幣八十萬元和其他衣物，而卒至一錢莫名，遂生厭世之念，一心想跑到平海橋去投河，她心裏過分傷心，沿途大哭，所以跳河未成，就被人勸阻，送到了警局。問他爲什麼要自殺？汪金玉很爽快地說：「杭州竟有這樣多的歹人，這樣的世界，這樣的命運，我還活着幹什麽？」</p>
<p>世界本來是這樣，命運可要看你自己走的路。汪金玉的悲劇，成爲了人家嘴上的笑料，一忽而傳說船夫任天福要强姦她，一忽而說有一個「被妾所棄」的男子願意留她爲伴，以便各得其所………。茶館酒店裏鬧哄哄，報紙副刋上也談得蠻起勁。有人惋惜汪金玉，又有人駡汪金王浪漫，更有人咀咒這個封建制度，咀咒這個黑暗社會。然而惜也妤，罵也罷，社會是如次，汪金玉畢竟做了犧牲者。雖然警局在捉賭的時候，偶然捉到了李永昌，但偶然終究是偶然而已，這實在是過渡時期中的一個嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>繼汪金玉事件之後，杭市社會又有一個小小的波浪：市政府民政科裏，有一個名叫周佐平的科員失踪了。兩天後，周佐平的妻子收到一封信，這是周佐平託朋友代寄的遺書。大意是親做了窮公員，經濟拮据，生活艱難，無意於生云云。報紙旣然找到了他底「下落」—死。於是不管周佐平是跳在錢塘江混濁的海潮裏或是縊死在荒鞠的山叢中，除了公敎人負有「兎死狐悲」之感外，社會是早就把他忘了個乾淨。汪金玉，是內地封建環境中培育出來底半新半舊的女子，他是抱着滿懷的美夢跳出了家庭的囚籠，可是她還不知道世情的複雜，社會的殘酷，一個單純而熱情的少女，終於斷送在罪惡社會的魔手中了。而周佐平呢，他是死在誰的手裏？雖說他沒有英雄的懷抱，但他何嘗沒有一襲肯幹的手？可是他竟失踪自殺了！我們底國家和社會在而臨着這樣嚴重危機的今日，記者忍不住要爲悲劇中的人物表示同情，向那些破壞社會秩序和擾亂人民生活的「英雄」們控訴！</p>

<h3>廣西的政治颶風</h3>
<p>— 本報四日桂林航訊息　特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>七月中旬，太平洋上奔騰的颶風帶着一個疲憊的身軀，捲流到西南火地的高空，慢慢的變成一股憂鬱的氣旋，一塲寒雨，颶風沉寂的消隱了，但是，地面上潛隱着不能够再遮掩抵禦的政治颶風，却以排山倒海的態勢，擴展開來，一塲風暴，焦灼了執政者的心，嚇破了貪官的胆，拍痛了小百姓的手，忙壞了記者的一枝筆，檢舉啊！一件驚人的大鴉片烟案！</p>
<h3>第一砲　叫老百姓種「麥」</h3>
<p>遠在兩年前的冬季，正是敵騎西犯，烽火薄江的時候，廣西的命運，也正飄搖在不可旦夕的危機裏，百色，這一個遠處處西陲的小山城，一時適與其會地成了廣西的軍政重心，而百色以西山澤蠻瘴的荒僻底小縣城，也就成了官癮深重的人們底逐鹿的標的，就在那時候複雜的環境裏，包含着一片絕大的政治陰謀的價値十四萬萬元的鴉片烟案就此揭幕了。</p>
<p>首先是兩個出名的官塲敗類一個叫做黃騏，一個叫做羅成均，夤緣奔走之下，分別出任西隆，西林兩縣縣長，這兩處地方遠在黔桂邊緣，峻嶺叢山，簡直就是化外之地，也就惟其如此的化外之地，才能產生一件無比的烟案，這兩位縣長走馬上任以前，據說曾經面受機宜不少，其中的主要「機宜」是「盡量種烟」，「以烟換錢」，「以錢購槍」錢和槍的用途，便是那個風雨飄搖的日子裏一段不可吿人的秘密了。如此如此，這般這般之後，兩個壞蛋的壞蛋到任了，下馬第一砲，是手諭，口諭各鄕村幹部：「要推行政令，自然非錢不行；但是錢從那裏來呢！自然只有大量種麥」（好一個「麥」字，就是「鴉片」的雅號）口諭一下，於是乎雷厲風行，其次便是開賭，縣長叫種烟，叫開賭，眞是恩深德厚，種吧！賭吧！於是，麥田處處綠，番攤開殺聲，行政的人員皆大歡喜，財源似水，關金如山，自縣長以至雜役者流，莫不「我飽欲死」，縣長房十裏面囤存的關金不能淸數而僅能用尺量，工役每天給縣長老爺倒水洗面的時候，向鈔票堆順手牽羊，也偸到了四百多萬元，眞是前無古人後無來者。</p>

<p>從烟苗成長以至變成「山渣糕」（烟土）小百姓的皮肉也榨到乾了的時候，疊連催促「解款」的「命令」也十萬火急地到了，於是，二百名長警背起了簇新的槍，浩浩蕩蕩的押着廿幾担鈔票，翻山越嶺，沿途征夫派糧，如臨大敵，一直趕到百色，這才任務終了，一塲功勞記上了牛皮簿，這時候，賢明的黃主席正在成都養病未還，省內政務統由民政廳長陳良佐代拆代行，跟着鈔票的出山，西隆西林兩縣人民吿密的文電如雪片而來，鬧到百色滿城風雨，盡人皆知。十四萬萬元的搜刮，寫成數目字，便是一、四〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元，一連串的圈，怎麽得了？陳廳長據說亦頗嫉惡如仇，自然馬上派員「澈査」，這時候，偏偏又有人同時打加急電話到兩縣去「密査」，離奇古怪的是電話却變成電報，有些人只能够在電話裏聽到一片「二七一四·四〇九九·六六四三·六三八二」之類的號碼，電話一發澈査的人員正在扒山的時候，黃騏和羅成均二人却巳是不耐久候，拍一拍屁股，逃之夭夭了。</p>
<p>順便要報道一句，是兩位先生都「逃』得極舒服，到重慶住一住，桂林光復，又顚着屁股跑回桂林小住小住，」聽得要通緝了，現在又乘船到香港去避暑了。湊巧的是，還和一位廳長的太太同船東下。案十發的時候，省政府在百色，兩廣監察使署在百色，長官部在百色，還有不知多少的政要雲集，但是，百色的天氣太壞了，我能够吿訴讀者的，也就有天氣而已。至於甚麽人甚麽人數了多少多少萬的鈔票，甚麽人甚麽時候收到的禮物最多，那都是空穴來風的舊事了。</p>
<h3>天目山行程</h3>
<p>— 本報六日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>「天目山垂兩乳長，龍飛鳳舞到錢唐」，這是郭景純天目山的詩句，天目兩乳，大槪指兩條溪流，一爲東天目的水，它經過臨安；成中苕溪，南苕溪，北苕溪三條水流，山洪來時，奔騰飛舞，冲瀉千里，直可傾至杭，嘉，吳一帶，相傳陳混曾在餘杭挖周圍三十里大塘，以便蓄水。免得侵害杭嘉吳一帶良田，現在餘杭除南湖外，尙有一北湖，據說東天目水是一直順流至太湖的。另西天目永則成天目溪，流入錢塘江的。</p>
<p>記者慕天目山之名，並且亟須知道靠近天目的各縣的近况，於是有天目山之行。預計經餘杭，臨安，於潛，禺化浙西四縣。</p>
<h3>山腳下　訪餘杭臨安</h3>
<p>由杭州到餘杭，意想到公路一定相當的壞，因爲駕駛十輪大卡車的司機特別小心，到沒有出什麼亂子，平安的到達了，我尋問當地很多老百姓，縣政府以及地方上的一些人士，知道中苕溪，南苕溪，北召溪都淤塞了，南湖也因爲積泥沙太多，所以也漸漸地不能容納由苕溪下來的水量，當地人更强調如果不修整南湖，則當南湖溢永時，泛濫冲瀉到浙西平原，這可不得了了。</p>
<p>餘杭在這八九年來，受敵僞的蹂躪。所以殘破不堪，案以蠢種出產為大宗而馳名全國的餘杭，現在亦惑覺毫無希望，因爲全部桑林，已犧牲百分之八十、由於桑林之喪失，所以無法養蠶，更無法製種。荒蕪下來的桑林面積也沒有種植旁的東西，不但如此，即是全縣的十九萬畝良田，五十萬畝山地，亦荒蕪不少。這或許因爲人力維艱，但據調査原有的十三萬人口，現在已有十一萬多人，相差也不過兩萬多人。</p>
<p>蠶種無法復興，因此著名的餘杭絲棉也一落千丈，原先全盛時代，蠶種有三十萬張，絲棉四五萬斤，但現在蠶種不上十萬張，絲棉一萬斤還不到。</p>
<p>餘杭另一的經濟事業爲毛筆管的出口，餘杭多細小的竹枝，可作筆管，也只有餘杭的竹，才能作筆管；戰前銷行全國，尤以華北，東北，蘇北爲最暢銷，現在因爲共產黨問題的存在，也無法北運了。</p>
<p>其他還出產一些黃白紙，黃紙是祭祀燒化用，本行銷蘇北，白紙可寫字，也銷在蘇北一帶，現在也停滯着毫無銷路。由於生產事業的無辦法，餘杭轉而經營商業，或爲浙西山地貨品的出口。其他日用品的納口，如臨安的笋乾，栗子，白菓，昌化的山核桃等，但也因爲市面的不景氣，銷路的呆滯，所以也漸漸地衰疲，記者到餘杭時，山貨行已倒閉了數十家，流露着無比的困難。</p>
<p>從餘杭到臨安，道路漸漸地起來，車子在泥溝深坑中掙扎，好容易拖到了臨安，但人和車都是疲憊異常。臨安，在抗戰時曾遭敵機慘烈的轟炸，城內幾無一究瓦，現在蓋搭一些草棚矮屋，但也零星散置，見得凋零與凄凉。</p>
<p>赴天目山途中</p>
<p>圖示杭徽國道敗坯之情形（註：天目山岡片均係張子純攝）</p>
<h3>山多於地　地多於田</h3>
<p>臨安山多於地，地多於田，人民僅六萬〇九十九人，而梯田又多於平原田，據謂百分之六十八是梯田，因爲是梯田，山水來時，冲刷的作用特別大，雖然我們在後方貴州習見濯濯的石童山，但如此間不設法保護，也會造成這個現象。如果也是童山，則天目水發的時候，一瀉千里，恐怕眞的江南杭嘉吳三屬要淹沒一些時，田地的收成要大受影響。</p>
<p>這裏以竹·木爲大宗出產，尤以笋乾馳名於全國，笋乾有三種，一爲焙笋頭，即最嫰的笋尖，一爲肥禿挺，較老的笋尖，一爲早圓，即將早笋採來製成圓形。他們製笋乾是將嫩笋掘出後放在鍋內加鹽煮熟，再把他焙乾，製成後用竹　　盛裝求售於市，這種笋乾味極鮮美，亦能耐久。如果能將他再改良，大可行銷國外，因爲外國的牛肉乾實不及笋乾的味道於萬一。</p>
<p>木的用處計有炭，香粉與柴，近來除大木頭外，柴炭的銷路較好，香粉是用來燒香點燭的，因行銷蘇北，銷路不暢，故也不大事經營。我以爲如果將香粉來製造蚊烟香，豈不更好？</p>
<p>竹子可以作木器，也有原竹行銷於外面的，他以數十根或十數根編成一帖，約可銷三四萬帖，但近也因爲時局的影響，銷路也不見得大好。</p>
<p>其他絲。茶均有出產，但一般地進入不景氣狀態。</p>
<p>在餘杭的時候，就聽說餘杭有稻苞虫作祟，但到臨安來碰見地方人士，才知道稻苞虫更較餘杭爲烈。政府人員因爲沒有藥品，沒有器材，沒有工具，也沒有適當辦法，讓可憐復可愛的農胞，求神拜佛，迎神賓會。沈主席出巡後已令省府所屬　極想辦法來補救。抽記者所知，稻苞虫的治理法最好當然是藥品，如果藥品沒有辦法時，可將木片或竹片作成大梳子，也可梳得下來的。我們希望已經產糧不足的餘杭臨安兩縣，再也不要疏忽於稻苞虫的爲害了。</p>
<p>在臨安郊外，可以望得到天目山，見它高高地聳立在雲際，像一隻巨大的天象。幾塊雲霧已進入了他的山腰，再也不能撫換它的背脊。</p>
<p>回首我們看看臨安山上的塔，地方老百姓吿訴我，這塔是紀念錢武肅王的，叫做功臣塔，以表崇敬錢鏐的意思。錢鏐確是臨安人，他的墳至今還葬在那裏，他的墳前有一座祠，那石人石馬的遺跡，想見當年的雄偉繁盛，但近來似也少人整理，故也露着殘敗之相。</p>
<p>當地老百姓吿訴我，這巳算是到了天目山脚下。</p>

<h3>山脈上　訪於潛昌化</h3>
<p>由臨安本可上東天目，而且現在縣府準備開發東天目，所以正在築一條公路，據當地人說：好玩的地方還是在西天目，我們根據史志，東天目有大仙峯·二仙峯·環翠峯·寳珠峯·將軍峯·象鼻峯·獅子峯·萬松嚴·望江台·觀月台·跳魚台·犀牛岡·龍鬚嶺·多寳坡·拼虎石·瀑布泉·玉劍泉·洗心泉·洗眼泉·煉丹池·浮玉池·白龍池·隱仙洞·紫陽洞·昭明寺·平溪庵·栖鳳亭·觀瀑亭等名勝。但恐因沒有公路，行旅不便，所以西天目較東天目爲有名了。</p>
<p>我們想繞過天目山，在這天目山的脈上先考察兩個縣，然後再到天目山去。所以仍乘大卡車向前進發，這一段路更是難走了，不但在泥溝中掙扎，而且要在沒有路面的泥土上奮鬥，經溪流時要涉水而過，車子搖搖擺擺地在太息。我曾問同行的譚計全兄：「交通部旣然許久沒有理會，爲何人民不來修理呢」？他吿訴我：「如果興師動衆，非但不見好，而且地方上也會埋怨多事」。事實也是如此，必須要有計劃，然而今天這條公路已不成其爲公路了。但也曾稱之爲杭徽公路，我眞不憤什麽時候才可修理起來！</p>
<p>到於　，稍稍休息一下，仍向前行，涉水過急灘，水潑刺到車身裏。眞的，我們的汽車已變成了水陸兩用的坦克車了，眞是聞所朱聞的事。</p>
<h3>七萬人口　三萬塊田</h3>
<p>到昌化縣，縣城未經破壞，但極狹小，她是浙江西隆，鄰接安徽，這裏時常有一些歹人來擾亂，不久前，有一些無賴的地痞，打着「××軍」的旗號，來混擾了一下，後來部隊開去，就逃跑到安徽去了。這裏更是山鄕，擁有七萬多人民，却只有三萬多塊田，每人僅能分到五分多田地。而七萬多人民，需要有三十萬担以上的米始能生活。這裏豐收時年產二十萬担左右，尙嫌不足。今年晚稻受着稻苞蟲爲害，這裏可說是最爲嚴重的。我們瞭望田野，黃色的一片，已是枯萎了的田禾，這實在是當前重要的問題。</p>
<p>昌化城裏只有兩保人家，女的平時織布，也有看蠶株茶，但這並非大宗，最大宗的出產當推木材。去年木材的銷路很好，可銷三四千兩，所謂兩，也就是木料的量法，他以一根有度的尺，量出木頭的大小，以兩·分。錢作計算法。當時每兩價最高的二十餘萬元，可想一筆鉅大的數字。但是現在不行了，銷路不好，不能收獲巨大的款項，也就是昌化少了一筆營養地方的費用。</p>
<p>赴天目山途中</p>
<p>圖示搶修後車輛尙須涉水行駛之情形。</p>
<p>昌化四周皆山，到是山林茂密，遠處很多高山，像有原始森林的樣子。有人說昌化僅憑杭徽公路作交通是不够的，最好還要利用天目溪，打通灘險，使他通桐廬江入錢江。然後可將當地出產的木材，源源由水道運出去。但他不想目前並非因爲沒有人知道昌化的木材，而是因爲國內的不寗，大家不敢興工建築。</p>
<p>山核桃是很有名的，但三年兩不收，這是山核桃的脾氣，今年巧逢不收之年，看這難關如何渡過？</p>
<p>昌化因爲多山，所以鑛藏極富，在縣屬浙門鄉孤山有無烟煤礦，石瑞鄕蒲村，日立關鄕前坑也都有煤，浙門鄉的已經開了二個月了。在縣屬頰口鄉寺塢，東山坪，仲珍鄉，武隆鎭，靑山潭都有銻鑛，頰口鄉的也已開了兩個月了。在縣屬的浙門鄕謝家村有錳鑛，頰口鄉百丈塢有鐵鑛，仁溪鄕張家塢有金鑛，而且據說安徽邊界上有些人都曾來零星淘過金子的。</p>
<p>昌化縣這許多　　，當然還待專家的測勘，但昌化旣有這許多的山，或者也有鑛，我們當然希望在工業無望的浙江土地上，突然會在地下發現意想不到的工業寳藏，則柴炭一切，需用較少，樹林也可以保全了，也不必着急長興的煤礦了，我們的火車也不怕沒有燃料了。</p>
<p>帶着興奮的情緒，由昌化循着不平的公路折返於潛。於滬，也經過敵人的慘烈轟炸，在日敵投降的後一天，日本兵還來到這裏無法無天地，搶過東西，殺過無辜的老百姓的。</p>
<p>這裏僅一條大街，現在也變成馬路了，房子不頂整齊。人口有五萬九千九百六十六人，面積有二十一萬二千三百〇四方公里。出產有白朮，這白朮據說能醫百病，有野生與種植兩種，野生的不易覓得，種植的較多，市上兜售的大半多爲種植的。所謂野生者就是產於山間，傳爲仙人所植。昔年前國府故主席林森氏常需此物。</p>
<p>其他也出產一些絲，木，筍乾，桃花紙，桐油，但並非爲大宗的產品。今年於潛也在鬧虫災，稻苞虫遍佈田野間，不易對付。</p>
<p>去過昌化於潛兩縣，也覺得經濟基礎的不十分穩固，眞是險象環生的時候。</p>
<p>在於潛郊外，我們再望望天目山巔，看他那樣的雄奇峻拔，我想，這浙西四縣的經濟基礎，總不會就此衰敗下去吧？聽說沈鴻烈氏已在爲他們籌措辦法了，不禁爲浙西前途祝福！</p>

<h3>公醫制度之障碍</h3>
<p>— 賈魁</p>
<p>二十年來，我國朝野上下，時有提倡公醫制度之呼聲。曇花一現之衛生部，及其後繼之衛生署，亦莫不以推行公醫制度爲中央衛生行政之圭臬。蓋我國地廣人衆，百分之八十以上之民衆爲農家。生活水準，衛生常識，無不甚低。大部份農村幾全無醫藥設施，即素有「文化城」雅號之北平市，其醫藥狀况亦極可憐。據戰前統計，該市死亡人數之百分之三十五，生前竟未經任何醫生診治。北平如是，全國可知。故有識之士，莫不謂解決中國醫藥問題，除醫藥國家化—實施公醫制度—之外，別無良策。然推行二十年來，雖不無表面成績，而殊乏實效。實以障碍重重，不一而足。若不澈底掃除，鋪平路面，恐公醫制度之前途甚難樂觀。至着一如已往，專事敷衍，非惟坐失時機，且必貽誤國族，是自好者之所切戒也。心所謂危，謹抒芻見。</p>
<p>私醫開業</p>
<p>公醫制度之最大障碍，首推現行之私醫開業制度。公與私勢如水火之不相容。在今日衛生行政機關以及社會團體對於私醫開業漫無限制之狀態下，而在另一方面空言推行公醫制度，實屬滑稽之尤。其無成效，固爲常然結果。說者每以歐美先進國家公醫私醫並行爲辯。是一般洋狀）元皮毛之見，削足適履，不顧國情，不可以不辯也。</p>
<p>歐美積習</p>
<p>歐美各國之開業制度，其由來已久，溯其原始，實爲其資本主義之遺毒。希臘盛時，醫學已脫離神權迷信，進入科學領域。治醫者以救人濟世爲職志。希波格拉底氏（Hippacrates）之受徒誓言中，對於以醫謀利一點，吿誡再三。今日吾醫學界對於希氐莫不尊崇倍至，非僅以其智能超越、份為　祖，實亦因其德行崇高，克爲楷模。故醫者爲科學，爲學　，應用以救死扶傷，强種健民。治醫者可以之爲職，不可以之爲業也。故醫者，根本不應列爲自由職業之一。惜我國於接受西醫之初，盲人瞎馬，率然倣效；健民之實效未收，營利之機隊已啓；不取其長而得其短；致我國醫學界流於今日之怪現象，良可哀也。</p>
<p>我國舊醫</p>
<p>揆之我國舊醫，原無向病家收費之習，而由營藥業者禮聘之，稱坐堂先生（黃河以北，冀魯各省），奉以食宿。並按年致送聘儀，年終分與紅利。病家請醫，例不出資，而務向該藥商購藥。故與病家發生直接營業關係者爲藥商，而非醫也。其意蓋以保持醫者之崇高與尊嚴。其制甚善。晚淸之際，此風尙存。今日之舊醫，則莫不收號金，索診費，以致往昔惇厚之風，流於營業惡習，同受西方資本主義之毒化。營業日盛，醫德益衰，憾也何如？然迷途未遠，回頭是岸，如何除此惡習，恢復舊日尊嚴？醫界賢達，執政當局，其急起而圖之也。</p>
<p>歐洲文藝復興以來，資本主義發展於前，科學醫學復興於後，至公共衛生事業之建立，祗有數十年之歷史，而公醫制度之提倡，尤爲最近之新設施。私醫營業，自古已然。根深蒂固，改革匪易。惟彼邦醫界團體組織健全，法治所不及者，醫藥團體每自行制裁，醫德水準，頗爲高伉。故業醫者亦必以科學爲重，而少欺詐之風。且對公益事業，多能從勞協助而樂於服務。其次則醫生人數衆多，醫生與民衆之比例亦多合理。營業醫雖亦　集於通都大邑，而願任公職者，尙太有人在。雖公醫報酬，例不若營業者收入之之豐，尙無缺乏人才之感。此與我國情形逈不相同。</p>
<p>合格醫生</p>
<p>査我國合格醫生至今不過萬餘人，與全國之需要相較，尙不足十分之一。現時我國之醫學院校不足二十。每校每年畢業學生平均不足三十人。假設短期內醫學院校增加一倍，每校並招收雙班。姑不問學生有無來源，而二十年內，亦祗能造就合格醫生五萬人。訓練能力幾已飽和，而與全國之需要相較，尙不足遠甚。然則欲推行建國健民之公醫制度，不亦戞戞乎其難哉！人材之缺乏爲我國公醫制度之一大障碍。如何加緊訓練，固爲重要解決辦法，而即時禁止私醫營業制度，實屬刻不容緩。一則以促令現有之醫務人員全體從公，再則以節制將來之醫務人員流於營業，俾國家造就一人材，即多一人服務。實以貧弱如我國，凡百落後，必急起直追，迎頭趕上，方克立足。若必步人後塵，任其自然演化，前車已覆，後者從之，其愚孰甚、</p>
<p>全體從公</p>
<p>或謂我國私醫營業歷史雖短，積習已深。况利之所在，衆人所趨。一旦禁止，反應必大。抗戰八年，醫藥界迄未動員，可爲股鑑。况以中國之大，人民之衆，政府以有限之人材，負全民之醫務，力所不逮。此亦似是而實非也。蓋公醫設施，所以普及醫藥於全國，促進民族之健康，减少國家之死亡，以收健民健國之效。凡屬黃帝子孫，自無不樂從。醫界爲智識份子，何能例外？抗戰以來，國家動員僅及於片面，迄未及於全體。醫藥界亦然。受徵調者僅及於每年新畢業之醫學生。私醫營業者，原不乏熱心愛國之士，而報國無從，徒歎奈何者，大有人在。及至衛生人員動員法出，祗規定每數十人抽征一人，實則具文而已，迄未普遍施行。是以往抗戰期間，醫藥界之所以未能全部動員者，乃全國各界動員未能盡到人事之例證之一耳。非醫藥界之不肯從公也。建國大業，國人皆與有份，執政當局又曷可再使醫藥界人員興向隅之嘆？明令禁止私醫營業，全體從公，此其時矣。</p>
<p>至若謂中國廣大，人民衆多。全民醫務，政府一時力所不及云云。此非保存私醫之理由，而適爲我國急宜推行公醫制度之原因。蓋我國目前之現象，地大人衆，而醫生不足。此少數之醫生，幾全集於通都大邑，形成畸形發展，以致鄕鎭農民毫無醫藥設施。內地數千百里之內，無一醫生。抗戰以前，貴州全省祗省會所在地貴陽，有醫生六人。民衆病痛全委諸迷信與魔術，更何保健衛生之可言。欲矯正此種畸形，捨以政治力量推行公醫制度外，別無善法。亦即以現有之人材，盡可能之人事，逐步推進。可期於三十年內，不難有成。以言配合建國，三十年之期間，實嫌過長。若再計不出此，任其自然演進，則漫漫長夜，恐無已時。</p>
<p>健民為十</p>
<p>撤消私醫營業制度，自非絕無困難。然吾人若能認定建國第一，健民爲上，則一切困難均可迎刃而解。提高公醫待遇，充實醫藥設備，當爲先決條件。蓋工欲善其事必先利其器，醫者亦然。故無論縣市醫院，或衛生院所醫藥器械務合標準。國內醫學院校之地點分配，尤須顧及省區情形，並與公醫結構密切合作，以提高其學術空氣。公醫人員工作相當時期，並應有進修機會，俾其知能與時俱進。至於待遇，似屬小節。營業之醫，月入千萬元者，百中一二而已。平均而論，豐衣足食，不處凍餒耳。惟終日勞碌，奴顏婢膝，亦殊爲可憐。若能依各地物價指數與以相常之待遇。衣食生活，子女敎育之外，並稍有積蓄，以備意外。再因年資實任之關係，叙級增减，以求其平。生活得以安定，工作得有保障，多數之營業醫，必樂於捨其私而從公。抗戰期間，公務人員，衣食兩缺，以致意志弱而點者，紛紛改業，自爲特殊現象。然將來公醫之待遇，實應較一般之公務員爲優。一因職責較重，二因人才缺乏。比之銀行職員之祗以經手之阿堵爲多，而所得之酬勞乃厚者，不可以同日語也。尤有要者，製藥售藥，必歸國營。旣可减少浪費，亦可節制消耗。每年可省却千萬億元之無謂損失。以我國之貧，民衆之苦，非祗不配有奢侈之私醫，且不應有虛靡之秘藥也。藥業國營，則競尙秘藥之風，因以根本掃除。一切醫藥人員，用藥一律，手續相同，則國內醫界，英美德日派別之分，乃可絕跡。一舉數得，何樂不爲？惟往者專賣之制，每重稅收。藥品專賣，應以統制爲原則，以供應爲目標。務以達到醫藥衛生之享受，無論貧富一律平等爲最終之目的。公立衛生醫藥機關，普遍供應之。病者配方以有公共醫生之簽字爲限。則私業者無藥可售，病家之就就於私醫者無難可買。營業之風，可迅速消減，何難之有？惟視吾人有此魄力否耳！</p>
<h3>精神與身體　健康的關係</h3>
<p>— 劉渝慈</p>
<p>精神周身體的關係至爲密切，前者是無影無踪，耳不能聽，目不能見，後者則有形有骨，瞭如指掌，精神與身體彼此關係的密切，就如同一架機器和推動機器的電流，機器是有形的，而電流的行動則是無形的，例如一個工廠內祗有機器而沒有通過電流，則機器運轉不靈，以致影響整個工廠不能開工，就彷彿一個人曾生了精神病症，雖然他的身體組織機構正常，可是他却不能工作了，反過來看，假如有了好的電流可是機器發生障碍呢，那就如同一個人的精神狀態雖然良好，可是他的身體過於孱弱多病，機器損壞待修，所以電流雖好而無用武之地，於是工廠也要暫時停工，所以一個人的整個健康是從心身兩方面謀得的，身體完美無缺，有如機件完整，精神良好，則若電力十足，兩全其美，整個工廠才能開工，出品才能精良，因爲精神同身體是相輔而行的，健全之心理必寓於健全之身體，語如「心廣體胖」，「心莊則體舒，心肅則容敬」，都是指心身密切相關而言。</p>
<p>心身相關於日常生活之中，所見到的例案極多，就以猫見犬而論，恐怖之餘，其毛高聳，這就是因爲牠的恐懼心理發生在先，於是生理的變化繼之於後，又如人當害羞時，臉發紅，驚嚇時，面發白，聽了鬼怪故事，毛骨不禁悚然，身體發高度寒熱，則易發脾氣，再如心境不佳，則胃口頓減，形容憔悴，諸如此類，不一而足，都是證明心身變化，戚戚相關</p>
<p>所以欲求一個整個完善的個人，是包括健全的身體和心理雙方面而說的，因爲一方面有了缺陷，定會影響另一方面也受到損害，我們就以最常耳聞的「神經衰弱」病症而論，它的現象如失眠，便結，頭疼，體重减輕，胃口不好等等，從表面來看，那些病狀都彷彿是生理方面發生變化的結果，其實，追本求源，仔細硏究的結果，即可證明那些都是心理作用的反常。</p>
<p>因爲自早我們腦子裏祗灌輸些生理衛生的常識，所以一生病，我們也就祗想從生理方面尋求根據，心理一方面似乎從沒被注意過，就如同當一隻電燈忽然息滅的時候，我們就祗以爲是那燈泡的本身發生損壞，其實，我們却忽略那電燈廠停供電流的原故，所以，當我們檢査那燈泡確實完好的時候，我們馬上就應該聯想到也許是電流沒有了。正如當我們檢査一個病者，找不出什麼毛病的時候，我們也就應該立刻想到那是他的心理作祟，其例一樣。</p>
<p>總之，環境的淸潔，食物的營養，傳染病的預防，滴滴涕殺虫的重要，都是我們對於生理衛生應當注意的事項，另一方面，灌輸精神衛生的常識，尋找心理衝突的起源，瞭解自己，認識個性，都是促進心理健康的藥石。同時，我們還須牢記心身彼此聯帶的關係，所以，「衛生與醫藥」的目的，是要促進我們心身兩方面的健康。</p>
<h3>瘧疾之症状</h3>
<p>— 鍾學禮</p>
<p>瘧疾之症狀，依瘧原虫種類而異，更以其發作時之型別患者之抵抗力年齡與急性期抑慢性期而異，輕者則爲大衆所常見之症象：初則畏寒，繼以發熱，終以出汗，於是熱度退却。重者則病勢凶險，稱惡性瘧，患者往往高熱不退，昏迷不醒，或腹疼如絞，或嘔吐不已，甚至死亡。幸沿海各省以前者爲大多數，而後者較少。但我國西南各省如雲南，貴州，四川，廣西一帶，則惡性瘧流行甚廣。舊時醫風十不昌？病原不明，俗稱之曰「瘴癘」。此種「瘴　」大都爲客省人士初人該地而染得，士人雖亦患之不若外來者之凶惡。昔日官宦貶職：商賈行旅常誤認爲水土不服，甚或鬼神作祟，罹此瘴　，慘遭不測，抗戰期間，滇緬公路爲我國大後方交通命脈，沿路工作人員受其累者，不知凡幾。而滇緬交界之思芳，八莫，騰衝，等城，竟以　癘之故，而人口减少，商業凋零，人民大都患貧血，脾腫發育不全，是爲慢性瘧之所累。作者目睹心傷爰賂書瘧疾症狀之梗槪奉吿國人力醫學常議之介紹。</p>
<p>瘧疾之爲患，非僅限於人類，其他動物如鷄猴等亦有之茲姑以人類所患之瘧疾爲限。人類瘧疾最重要者可分爲三種，（一）間日瘧，（二）三日瘧，（三）惡性瘧。</p>
<p>此三種瘧疾爲三種「瘧原虫」所致之疾病，以虫類不同，生活史各異，遂於症象上亦各各不同。然不論何種瘧疾，各具有相似之下列特徵。</p>
<p>（一）週期性　即每種急性期瘧疾，皆有畏寒，發熱出汗，熱退西種病狀，是為一週期，聞日瘧以每隔日為一週，三日瘧則每隔二日發作一次，而惡性瘧，以原虫之生活史可自二十四小時迄四十八小時不等，故較不規律，每日發作或間日發作渚皆有之，畏寒時間，大槪平均爲數十分鐘以迄一二小時發作時，患者初感疲乏，手足酸軟，精神不振，頭痛昏沉，畏微風，喜進熱湯，烤爐側，甚而覆以被褥數　，尙未能禦寒感，繼則戰兢發生，齒牙相擊，咯咯成聲斯時也，患者臉色蒼白，形容憔悴，指甲作紫褐色。表皮輙現鵝皮狀，皮膚溫度下降，而體溫確已增高，繼而熱度上昇，達攝氏四十度左右，於是皮色由蒼白而腓紅，皮溫亦增高，頭痛常增劇，甚者常呈神經系症狀與消化系症狀，脈膊則山微細而轉强，如是維持凡三四小時以迄十餘小時不等，然後熱度驟退，伴以大汗淋漓，體弱者不能支持大汗時患者常若口渴，熱退後更感軟弱無力，失水之症狀，亦屬常見者。初發瘧疾者，熱退後大都霍然若愈，可起床行動，除軟弱外無他疾苦</p>
<p>（二）陣發性　如係間日瘧，則大都第二日不發熱，第三日復發熱，重現前節所述之症象，週而復始，如不加以藥治，則可陣發十次左有，綿延二三星期之久，迨至病人之天然抵抗力逐漸產生，而自然制止，三日　則較頑固，逢第四日發作不易自制，惡性瘧亦具此陣發性，但其週期性不甚顯著，此應亦有自然制止之趨勢爲時亦須二三星期。</p>
<p>（三）復發性　如急性期病者未受治療，或未經妥治者皆由此急性期階段而入慢性期，此期之特徵，乃屢次復發。大都患慢性瘧者一經勞動或偶受風寒，或以他疾而舉行手術後，天然之抵抗力較遜時，常現復發。此時病者大都呈貧血之症狀，如心悸，頭昏，目眩，易感疲乏，精神頹廢，消化不良，甚而水腫，氣促等等。如作體格試騐，則此等患者常現消瘦，幼童發育受阻，臉容蒼白，眼白呈黃疸，脾臟腫大且堅實，肝臟亦較大。貧血過劇者有心臟擴大有收縮期雜音。此外有胸水腹水及全身水腫。一般言之，三日瘧之復發性最著，可達二三年之久；間日瘧次之；惡性瘧之復發期大約以一年爲限。若治以奎寗或阿滌平，則惡性瘧與三日瘧較易受藥物之控制，而間日瘧用藥後亦收效，但愈後仍易復發。</p>
<p>至於惡性瘧之症狀如上述而外，變異良多，一日一發或隔日一發，旣難揣測，且多凶型之發作，可類似多種非　性疾俗病，醫家診斷上常感棘手。</p>
<p>惡性瘧，熱型無定，不必有週期，如病起較緩，熱度持續不退，極似腸傷寒。或起病驟急，熱度持續，渾身作痛，臉容腓紅，眼膜充血，可像初期無斑時之斑疹傷寒或迴歸熱。或一日之間體溫驟昇驟降無定，則可誤斷爲黑熱病。或以腹痛如絞，腹肌强直而緊張，可誤診盲賜炎或其他腹內外科病而舉行手術。時而患者現腹痛腹瀉，大便中含血液與黏液，酷似痢疾。或作深度黃疸，嘔吐不已，酷似胆囊炎胆管炎以及肝炎。或則昏迷，驚厥，　語失智，酷似腦炎。或呈腦膜刺戰之症狀，而似腦膜炎。或以精神失常胡言亂語，致誤爲神經病者。或則水腫劇烈，小便減少，且含紅白血球，酷似腎炎。亦有患風疹塊者。凡此皆係惡性瘧之特殊表現。故瘧疾之診斷，全憑症狀，每易致誤，必須反復作血液抺片之檢査，庶能確定。</p>

<h3>劉四的幻夢</h3>
<p>— 陳侖</p>
<p>在荒涼的山谷裏，一條新鐵路依山繞水往前伸展，彎彎曲曲像一條活的巨蟒，爬行向人眼看不到的地方。</p>
<p>這無異是「開發西北」的彩筆，所抹下濃重的一筆，是蘸着若干個生者死者的血與汗所抹下的偉大·壯麗·嚴肅·有力的一筆。</p>
<p>在這一條新路的每一塊枕木的底層，似乎都有一個靈魂支持着。留下這可紀念的一筆，眞的，是着實不容易啊！</p>
<p>因爲是新路，行車常發生意外。出軌·塌方。撞車。壓斃人……是常有的事。</p>
<p>像寄生蟲一樣，劉四便附着在這條路的邊緣上的「道班」上弄碗飯吃；但劉四的任務，却恰恰同寄生蟲相反，因爲他是養護培修這條路的眞正的「靑年保姆」。</p>
<p>劉四是黃汜區內一個沒家的河南人。其實誰沒有個家呢？劉四可又不是從山縫裏蹦出來的？不過，據劉四說，家是在一個黃昏裏被黃水冲得無影無踪了。雖然這是一個大的悲哀，就是現在提起家來，劉四也得難過半天。不過這樣倒給劉四個一身無掛。不然誰會兩個肩膀抬一個腦袋流浪到這荒凉的山谷裏來呢？旣不會到這裏，當然這「開發西北」的偉大工作，又怎會輪到自已頭上呢？說句實話，劉四失掉家，倒是天然的給他一個向上的好機會。</p>
<p>劉四很安於他的工作，每天他跟着工頭沿路基察看，他們一夥扛着鐵鍋·洋鍬·鍁·鹿頭大撬棍，軌距尺……細心的尋找每一段路基，每一根枕木，每一塊鋼軌，每一個細小的零件不合標準的毛病：像釘碗匠人在面前的一堆土裏細心尋找那失去的余鋼鑽一樣，他們耐心的費盡腦筋去尋找每一個細小的毛病，以便每一個不合標準的地方，得以修改，千萬個乘車的人得到生命的安全。但任劉四他們早起晚睡，將一己的所有的心血完全洒落在這平行的兩條鐵軌上，然行車仍常浚生意外，他們是跌落在深深的憂鬱的網裏了。</p>
<p>這天，當古銅色的夕陽滑落在西山脊梁後邊的時候，劉四跟着他們一夥拖着憂鬱沉重的脚步收工了。工作使他們疲勞得像一條老黃牛似的慢吞吞地，帶着悶人的銅鈴，敲着送晚的鈴聲，一步步挪回那暫時的家去。飯後·劉四拉一條破舊的竹蓆，躺在道班房前的樹下出神。他細心的沉思，像貪汚舞弊的官吏們，躺在暗室的火烟燈旁，思索剮地皮的妙法一樣，劉四在迷縫着眼用盡腦力思索行車安全的措置。</p>
<p>晚風，像張資平小說裏靑年愛人柔和細嫩的纖指一樣，在撫摸着劉四的胸脯，但劉四沒有過這樣的「羅曼絲」他也想不到這上面去。不過，一天的疲勞，那條捆綁一着他的無形的繩索，給晚風一吹，倒吹得寸寸斷落，落得一身舒適痛快。</p>
<p>在四週同伴們起了酣聲的時候，劉四矇朧問　見不遠的地方有細微的聲音在說話。雖然聲音不大，但話聲裏同樣的有輕聲的嘆息，搥胸的憤懣，激烈的抗辯，更有恐嚇性的演說；像在聽礦石無綫電收音機內的京劇一樣，雖然聲音較小，但，倒是生旦凈末，樣樣供全。不覺奇怪起來。側耳細聽，像是在開什麽會議，檢討什麽事情，不覺更是奇怪，於是飄身而起，躱在一顆大槐樹後邊，要看個明白，聽個究竟。他還沒有站穩，便一眼看見一大羣料之　正在熱烈的爭辯着什麽，這時火車頭老板睜着一隻毒龍似的眼怪叫了幾聲已經退席，那孤苦伶仃的道釘小兒，還瞪着一雙黑豆小眼，向火車頭退去的方向直直地盯着，他憤懣的向大家說：</p>
<p>「多少次了，頭子睜着傲謾鄙視怕人的毒眼瞭我，以爲我這顯微鏡下纔能看到的人物不足輕重，不値一文大錢。有時還對我空通空通的惡駡，甚至時不時對我狂吼：說我是無用的飯桶，說我是世界上頭等的廢物；誰知前天我們道釘的伙伴們，因爲賭氣稍一　懈，他便出軌走入歧途了。這眞是咎由自取！我們比方說吧：我們就是飯桶，也還能盛飯給大家吃，給大家服點務，比起那踏在人們頭上高喊爲社會爲人類的英雄們，心中總要坦然得多吧？雖然我們道釘伙伴們，都是因先天不足，後天失調，生得一付又瘦又黑的可憐像，但我們能賣出一份傻勁，有骨氣，比起那大腹便硬吃人血的臭蟲們，總要强得多吧？這决車頭的出軌，就是給他一個嚴厲的懲處，如果他仍執迷不悟，那我們只有全體改行另作他圖了。」</p>
<p>「嘿嘿！火車便是這樣出軌的，我要在工作時特別注意這點。」劉四在一面偸聽，一面心裏在打着他的鐵算盤。</p>
<p>接着是被壓得臉皮發靑的鋼軌先生大發議論：</p>
<p>「哎，你們還是間接的受着迫害哩，只有我是直接的承受着他的荼毒。他每天氣宇昂然挺胸闊步的在我脊背上奔馳，你們來看看，我背上的黑皮，正在一層層的脫落着，那種痛苦才眞的忍無可忍……」說着他袒開臂膀側着身子讓大家看他的創傷言下有無限感慨之意。他綏了口氣又接着說：「……他不但不給我一丁點的安慰，反常常的亂吵亂駡；還有彎道上我們的夥計們，那更苦，每次他馳過那裏，都把他們壓得吱吱喞喞扎扎地叫得　　　聲一般刺耳，這無天日的生活，我們怎過得了啊？所以，前天道自小兒們一鬆懈，我們便乘勢散開來息息腿脚，於是那巍巍然若廟堂之器的車頭便掉道了，這眞是不得已的事情，以我說這是活該如此·</p>
<p>「對，對！眞是活該如此！」許多料之靈們同聲的應和着。</p>
<p>後來好打瞌睡的枕木大爺，也報吿了他們夥計們的慘劇，他說他們夥訂們的犧牲，那才眞是死得不明不白，那才眞是無謂的犧牲，他們並沒有犯過什麽大過錯，爲什麽車頭一怒，便瀉下來大堆的爐滓毒火，而給他們用了慘酷的火刑呢？世界上還應有這樣的刑法嗎？在廿世紀的現在，這是非常不合理的，末了他請衆位爲那些燒得焦頭爛額斷腰折臂的夥計們復仇，並誓作後援，通知車頭不得再有同樣　事發生，並設法轉吿車站方面，　作灰坑，以維料之　世界的永久和平。說完，他揩了揩鼻尖上的汗珠，還輕聲歎息了一陣，大家當然又是同聲應和一致贊成。</p>
<p>這時，氣得面色發靑發白的道　小姐，因爲口羞面善，不願在人顯露頭角，未發表什麼意見，只躱在枕木下邊和兩旁小聲咀咒；最後魚尾板掌粗，螺絲螺拴姊妹們也都發表了各個的高見，大家一致認爲火車頭這種法西斯行爲應該打倒。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻！」劉四在暗中可笑，他笑這一羣傻瓜似的料之靈實在太愚屬得可觀。他心裘在說：「。這是我們人的事，怎能怪火車頭呢？」他正在思索什麼，忽然又有人在說話了，抬頭一看，原來是鋼軌先生在作結論：</p>
<p>「大家！」鋼軌先生在喊完大家之後，略略一停，稍一定神，似乎想引起大家的注意力似的，便又接着說了下去：「根據大家剛才報吿的各節，我們可以這樣說，凡是一個料之靈，也和人一樣，如果想做一件事情，那不是單憑一已的能力所能做到的。譬如我們拿一個人體來比，一個人並不是光長了個腦袋就算完事，有腦袋了還得長出個眼睛來，不然瞎着眼過日子那多麼痛苦，有了眼還得長出鼻子來專司呼吸，光呼吸不能得到充份的營養，還得長出口來吃東西，吃了東西，要想消化吸收排瀉，因之五臟六腑缺一不可；沒有四肢固然不行，然而人體是無數的人眼看不到的極小的細胞所組成，如果沒有細胞，根本就組織不成人體，那容你忽視嗎？什麽都是配合着分工合作，不容蔑視忽略每一個小官節小零件。不但如此，你還得加意的維護他們，培養他們，才能發出大的效力，　道理可推至一個團體，一個社會都是如此。明乎此，平安無事，否則便處處碰壁。最近的火車掉道出軌，便是因爲傲慢的火車……」鋼軌先生一口氣講到這裏，正興奮得了不得的時候，忽然聽見空通空通的聲音，由遠而近，他抬頭一看，火車頭睜着兩隻毒龍似的巨目，漸漸向他這裏馳騁過來，不覺有點慌了起來，他向大家擺了擺手，好像吿訴衆位料之靈說：「這可惡的東西又向我們來了，我們暫且躱避一時再說！」沒有講話便先自走了。衆位斜之靈都在譏諷他的膽子過小，劉四也躱在樹後附和着笑，正在這時，火車已走到跟前，似乎又掉道出軌了。因爲火車這時正走着下坡道，一時收留不住，直朝着劉四躱着的這棵樹撞了過來，劉四要想跑開，已來不急，不覺猛然一驚，帶着一棵悸動的心逃出夢境。</p>
<p>他揉了揉眼，讓心沉靜了一下，看看遠天，正是早晨魚肚白的時候，晨風習習地吹着，同伴們還在甜蜜的打着酣聲；他打開回憶的門扉，讓思索的繩子去拴回夢境的一切。不禁笑了：「奇怪！怎麽昨晚會夢到這樣一個想也想不到的怪夢呢？」他將夢裏的情景一節一節的溫習着。他同情他們，可憐他們。但他又覺得這是　誕不經的怪事。</p>
<p>「難道一些材料也有靈魂嗎？」他自己問　自己。</p>
<p>早飯，他們又出發工作了。路上，劉四將昨晚的怪夢吿訴了大家，並讓他們特別注意道釘的鬆弛和不穩固的地方，因爲在一個段落，如果有幾個道釘鬆弛，會很容易的引起出軌的毛病的，那是不容人疏忽的。他們今天同往日一樣的都很熱心的工作着早上的三次快車很平安的走過這一段。</p>
<p>响午，他們發薪了。算了算賬，每人兩萬三千元的　餉，除了一萬四千元的伙食費和扣除零用外，每人只領到兩三千元。於是，穿衣，吃飯，養家，糊口等問題……都擁進了他們的腦海，上午那熱心的緊張的工作情緒，被生活的狂潮擠得化歸烏有了。他們每人揑着　兩張新的鈔票，苦喪着臉，抖　着鈔票花拉花拉的聲音，喃喃的嘟嚕着：</p>
<p>「這怎麼了啊？這怎麽了啊？這要命的生活呀！」</p>
<p>有人打趣着劉四：</p>
<p>「劉四！我們也是顯微鏡下纔能看到的道釘階級的「飯桶」，我們天天關心着鐵路，甚至夢裏還計劃着養護，培修的工作，務期做到使千萬個乘車者得到生命安全的地步；鐵路壞了，有我們關心着養護培修，改善，但關於我們的生活……哎哎，有誰來關心我們呢？」</p>
<p>「呃，呃！」劉四瞪着眼睛答不出一個字來。</p>
<h3>鄭曼青花卉</h3>
<h3>厭煩之聲</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我常常問我的朋友，爲什麼我的四周，一天到晚充滿着厭煩之聲？</p>
<p>清最一睜開眼睛，就飛來一串刺耳的「媽呀媽呀」，是鄰家一個患病的小女孩，爺死了，娘跟了人，剩下一個六十歲的瞎眼老祖母，早晨瞎眼婆婆摸索到灶下去燒麩皮粥，那孩子就蜷在一條破蓆上慘聲叫着媽。</p>
<p>太陽高高昇起，客堂裏的掛鐘打過九下，不遲不早，必有一個斷腿的乞丐爬過我的窗下，一而砰砰磕頭，一面大哭大喊：「太太啊！……小姐啊……救救苦人！……餓死了啊！……</p>
<p>下午淡淡的陽光照到我房裏，對門張家嫂嫂照例來了，枯黃的瓜子臉，一把眼淚，一把鼻涕，向我一遍又一遍的嘮叨：「小姐，他的病是沒望了呀！……沒田沒產，剩下六個孩子，叫我如何過啊！……」</p>
<p>黃昏，寂靜的斗室中，陳老伯伯的白鬍髭在燈光下一顫一顫抖動，他嘆着：「唉！日子不能過了！……活到七十歲，還要去做牛馬！……唉！甚至去做牛馬都不得一飽啊！唉唉！……」</p>
<p>厭煩啊！這「媽呀媽呀」，這「太太小姐」，這「叫我如何過呀」，這「唉唉」，……</p>
<p>從太陽昇起，到日頭落下，我的耳中塞滿了厭煩之聲，我受不住，我向我的朋友求着救。</p>
<p>可是我的朋友說，這些厭煩之聲，就是人生的花朶，牠點綴了單調的世界，充實了詩人的靈魂。怕我不信，朋友做了一個比喩說：「你不是很歡喜欣賞許多可歌可泣的詩文嗎？假使沒有這些厭煩之聲，詩人和文人，又如何寫得出那些可歌可泣的詩文來呢？」</p>
<p>朋友的話對嗎？我不知道。可是從那時起，我雖仍害怕着這些厭煩之聲，却更愛讀一切可歌可泣的詩文，但不再是「欣賞」，而是「咀嚼」。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這地方雖然小得可以，在軍事上却相當重要，本身是平漢路的咽喉，小鐵路又通着豐台，從豐台分叉上，一條直達通縣，一條經　房直達天津。蘆溝橋，宛平，就在身邊，西北過去不多一點，就是門頭溝，而且距離北平，才三十來里。別說火車汽車，就是，揀匹好馬，祗消起個　頭，一脥眼皮，也就到了。</p>
<p>我們這所屋子，就在鐵廠西邊，祗隔着一個小山埂子，本來住着一個工程師；他嫌太僻靜，就搬到廠裏去了。我和這位工程師，同過一年學，所以很不費事的就租過來了。</p>
<p>黃昏一到，我們這裏簡直靜得跟厝屋一般。可有時也很鬧，播音哪，一一黃西皮哪，「起來，起來，不願做奴隸的人們」哪，等等。可是這是一種做作的鬧，一種有過訓練的鬧；換句話，這種鬧，正是我們工作上的掩蔽，或稱僞裝。</p>
<p>到了上燈之後，我們也不必鬧了。而且在這緊張的關頭上，我們很不願鬧。</p>
<p>果然，鶴見玉正在屋子裏踱着的當口，忽然隱隱地傳來一聲砲響。鶴見玉立刻站住，他受過嚴格訓練，機警得像一頭警犬。不到五秒鐘，又是兩響。行家一聽，就辨別出來，這是日本小型野戰砲響聲。</p>
<p>鶴見一聽見第二響的砲聲，立刻跑到屋門口，揭起門帘，對外面打了一個手勢，回頭瞧了我一眼，一蹓步到了大炕頭邊，打開樹櫃，一伸手拉出上一副耳機，套在頭上，又拿出一個小話筒，同時把機鈕撥開了。他的動作，那樣的敏捷，手勢那樣的熟譜乾凈，神氣那樣的沉着冷靜，眞正叫人佩服。</p>
<p>「三十五號……七〇七……一一……—三十五號……七〇七……一雖是叫着號碼，仍舊保持着一口漂亮的　京話音。</p>
<p>櫉櫃裏裝置的這套東西，是德國最新式的收發兩用無綫電話，同時也可以收到各種週波的廣播。全機才六七磅的分量，折收起來，外表僅是一隻手提小型皮匝。</p>
<p>「三十五號……七〇七……一一……喂，……呃……一六一……總部……」電話已經接通了。</p>
<p>這時砲聲一陣比一陣緊，偶然也聽得出幾聲機關槍和步槍。</p>

<h3>上海</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>「玻璃照穿了上海人的心里，上海人却想不穿！」</p>
<p>玻璃照穿了上海，玻璃透視了上海。上海人每一節腸子轉幾個灣，都被玻璃鏡子照得淸淸楚楚。</p>
<p>隨便走到那一家公司無不以玻璃爲標榜者。玻璃的製品：雨衣，背帶，褲帶，女人皮包，梳子，鞋子，襪子，錶帶，鏡子，香烟盒子，香烟嘴，被單，衣料，手槍套，熱水袋……我們看到的是玻璃物品，男男女女穿的用的是玻璃物品。前後只有數月，上海已成一個花花的玻璃世界。</p>
<p>這一類玻璃物品，誠然頗多貨眞價　，但是，買玻璃用品的人，並不全爲了貨眞價廉。（其實有多少玻璃品也並不便宜。）他們目的；大家都搶着愛摩登，我怎能例外？至少，要買一根玻璃皮帶用用，即使是猶太貨也好，只要像個玻璃品，否則，實在心有未甘。</p>
<p>用玻璃品是各人自由，筆者自不敢吹毛求疵，但是有許多許多人，收入並不充裕，也死要摩　，死爭面子米免可憐，而買了一根玻璃帶，別的服裝配合不起來，尤共痛苦！赤裸裸地說，不必用玻璃品的人，勉强弄個玻璃東西，　　以　之，爲了追逐虛藥，其實·一個人的漂亮，不在外表，它包括着身體的健康，心地的善良，智識的充實。倘若自已有了一個很好褲帶，而爲了迎接時髦再去買一條玻璃褲帶子用，這又何必呢？其實·說穿了，　　品在上海走紅，在美國却已最落伍。玻璃照穿上海人心理，但上海人始終想不！</p>
<p>最近，　說美國出產了第一部玻璃汽車，據說是戰爭以前很多工程師設計製造的，這種汽車的設計者，是資歷頗深的飛機和汽車設計師威廉史道脫先生，所以，他就把這輛玻璃汽車稱作「史道脫四十六型」·</p>
<p>有錢的暴發戶，聽到了道個消息該多麼高興啊！希望美國威廉史道脫先生從速的趕造，大量的出產，運到上海來給那些大人先生太太小姐用，否則，他們會急得跳脚，如同鍋裏的螞蟻一樣。</p>
<p>可是，只買得起玻璃褲帶玻璃皮包的少男代女們，對於玻璃汽車當然是很欣賞，則心有餘而力不足，又多一種痛苦、</p>
<p>如今中國，一半人在受難，一半人在開玩笑，在迫逐虛榮。</p>
<p>玻璃透視了上海人的心理，上海人自己却想不穿！</p>
<p>玻璃上海，當心，有一天會碎了的！</p>

<p>星期一平晨，照例上寫字間辦公，在某處電車站等候電車，同時有三個賣報童子，年紀大的的摸十二三歲，最小的一個不過十歲光景，各人手裏拿了一疊報紙，向客人喊賣，我向最小的賣報童預備買一份申報，當我付了錢，那孩子正在抽着一份申報交給我的時候，冷不防手裏的一份報，忽被年紀大的孩子嚓的一聲搶了過去，那賣報孩子急的幾乎哭了，我心裏有些不明白，認爲是搶生意，便斥着那大孩子道：「買報是我的自由，我願意向誰買就是誰，你怎麼這樣撒野呢？」那大孩子圓睜兩眼，怒氣冲冲的道：「我們這裏賣報是劃分地段的，他（指賣報的小孩子）不是我們地段裏面的人，怎許他越界搶生意呢？」我聽了不免有些感情衝動，怒着喝道：「什麼地段不地段，中國的事體就壞在地段上面，你們小小年紀，腦筋裏便有地段，無怪爲着爭地段要內亂不息了。」那大孩子越發光火道：「我們都拜老頭子的，他沒有拜我們的老頭子呀！我去請老頭子來。」說着拉了其他一個年紀稍大的賣報孩子，匆匆跑開去，灣進某里某弄，一回兒，兩個孩子由弄裘走出來，背後果然跟着兩個白相人典型的所謂老頭子，一色敞領黑香雲紗短衫袴，腰間束了一條很長的白紡綢袴帶，其中一個比較高大些的，手裏拿了剛才搶到的一份申報，面相十分難看，惡狠狠地迎面走來，我想一定尋事來了，我等着電車要緊上寫字間，那有功夫和他們糾　，萬一吃了眼前虧，還要被站在身旁的許多看熱鬧人好笑，深悔多一事不如少一事，但是那兩個老頭子已經走近了，嘴裏不三不四，我只索硬着頭皮和他們講理性，把言語來屈服他們，不料我還未出口，那高大週子的老頭子把眼睛一彈，面孔一板道：「誰敢太歲頭上來動土，區區在本地段裏，吃喝了十幾年了，誰想分我的餘潤，到我拳頭上來領。」邊說邊揎拳捋臂，一派白相人作風，我心裏暗想秀才碰着兵，有理講勿淸，事態弄僵了，這時被搶去報的小孩子，不知怎樣嗚的又哭起來了，說時遲，那時快，我的背後驟地裏竄出一個梢長大漢來，山東口音駡道。「你是什麽東西，地段不地段，張開眼睛看看，現在什麼時代。」只聽見綽—綽—兩響，那老頭子的臉頰上着了兩記，動作表演十分爽快，四圍看熱鬧的　　　　，另一個同來的老頭子，一把拖了被打的老頭子道：「老大，申報還給小鬼，我們去找爺爺來和他們說話。」那彼打的老頭子把報紙向地下一擲，扭轉身子便跑，這時候×路電車到站，乘客蜂擁而上，我也跨上電車，山東人拍拍我的肩膀，笑着說道：「老哥，要講和平還是靠武力，理性是講不淸的呀！」我深深表示感謝，一個回敬他會心的微笑。</p>

<p>有一個在巴黎的中國科學家，他沒有研究，就向人們宣佈：「月球和地球不會相撞。」因此有許多人都去訪問他，問他甚麼理由，但他連聲說：「我知道不會撞的。」最後，他和法國人睹了大量金錢的東道。</p>
<p>到了法國科學家宣佈月球和地球相撞的一天，月球和地球眞的沒有相撞，因此，中國的科學家得到大量的金錢了。同時，又又許多人訪問他了，這位中國科學家說：「我不必研究就知道不會撞的，你們不想到？即使要撞，大家不是同　於監，我也就不必拿出錢來，你們也不能够再對我說：「你錯了…」</p>

<h3>Marshal Ma Arrives at Kuling with Song President</h3>
<h3>Rumored to Carry Letter from Zhou Enlai to the Chairman</h3>
<h3>Lushan Talk Conference to Open Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Ma left his residence on Ninghai Road around 2:00 PM on the 15th to fly by special plane to Xunyang four times before heading to Kuling. The date of his descent will depend on the needs of the KMT-CCP negotiation environment. The Xunyang Ertoukou Airport has been flooded for days, preventing aircraft from landing. According to news from Jiujiang this afternoon, the water has not receded, yet Marshal Ma risked flying there. It is rumored that Marshal Ma is carrying a letter from Zhou Enlai to Chairman Chiang, which is believed to contain the CCP's response to the Chairman's message. It is also learned that Marshal Ma originally planned to return to his country earlier, but after the joint statement was issued, both the KMT and the CCP expressed their willingness to continue negotiations to resolve political issues. Therefore, Marshal Ma no longer plans to return home early. It is rumored that the US Senate has repeatedly hoped for Marshal Ma's return, as it is generally believed that Marshal Ma's peace mediation in China is hopeless. However, most senators deeply hope that Marshal Ma can personally return home to provide a responsible report to the Senate and redefine their policy. However, Marshal Ma personally understands the current situation in our country and consistently believes that the door to peaceful negotiation has not been closed, so he has decided to make a final effort and not return home for the time being.</p>
<p>[Our Kuling Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Marshall, accompanied by President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and his staff and secretaries, arrived in Kuling together at 6:30 PM on the 15th. Marshal Ma's wife personally went to Xiaotianchi to greet Marshal Ma. When passing through Kuling Street, some children who knew Marshal Ma surrounded him and cheered with his entourage. Marshal Ma responded with a kind smile. Marshal Ma then returned to his residence at No. 40 Hexi Road to rest. President Song went directly to pay respects to the Chairman after arriving, talking for about an hour. Mrs. Chiang sent him off to the Song family's residence at No. 3. It is said that Mr. Song will go down the mountain and return to Nanjing tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] President Song told reporters who greeted him before entering Kuling Street on the 15th that he had agreed with the Chairman during his last departure from Kuling to report on the political situation every two weeks. This visit is to fulfill that promise. He is unaware of rumors that the government will convene the Lushan Talk Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] President Song told reporters who greeted him before entering Kuling Street on the 15th that he had agreed with the Chairman during his last departure from Kuling to report on the political situation every two weeks. This visit is to fulfill that promise. He is unaware of rumors that the government will convene the Lushan Talk Conference for the National Assembly to discuss and make a choice, in order to create a sound and feasible constitution. The main purpose of the talk conference that the Chairman will convene in Kuling, involving the heads of universities, speakers of provincial and municipal councils, and other parties, is to exchange opinions. It is believed that representatives of all parties will come here to participate, provide opinions, and create a sound and feasible draft constitution, so that the National Assembly can be held as scheduled. It is said that this talk conference will open around September 20th, before the Political Consultative Conference on October 10th, and will last for about a week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 15th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, member of the Standing Committee, enjoyed a visit to the Immortal Cave and Big Tianchi today, and will return to Nanjing soon. It is learned that the party's newspaper's suggestion to convene the Lushan Talk Conference has not yet been formally proposed to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling Dispatch, 5th] Amidst widespread rumors that a talk conference would be held in Lushan, reporters inquired with reliable sources, who replied that they had not heard of it.</p>
<p>[Our Kuling Dispatch, 15th] People here who understand the government solemnly stated that the government has always been tolerant and yielding towards the CCP. Regarding the Communist army, it does not require them to completely withdraw from the areas they occupied after the truce order, but only requires them to withdraw from some areas that already constitute a threat to peace and obstruct traffic. Currently, this area is mainly in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>(Also available: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram to Chairman Chiang and telegram to Mao Zedong. Please read the second page.)</p>
<p>America Values the Chairman's Message</p>
<p>[US News Service, Washington Dispatch, 14th] When the State Department was asked about its views on Chairman Chiang's Victory Day message, a spokesperson replied: The State Department is extremely interested in this message, but diplomatic circles have some disappointment with Chairman Chiang's message. They believe that Chairman Chiang's message failed to address the current situation. Observers believe that the message is nothing more than a restatement of Chiang's consistent position over the past four years. Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have discovered that the Nationalist government is unwilling to discuss politics with the CCP unless the CCP lays down its arms. On the other hand, the CCP insists that it must lay down its arms only after political negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch, 14th] The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune both published Chairman Chiang's message on the front page in a prominent position, but did not elaborate. Most headlines emphasized Chairman Chiang's guarantee to end one-party rule.</p>
<h3>Robertson and Ye Jianying Leave Nanjing</h3>
<h3>Visit Special Envoy Ma Together with Zhou Enlai Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Robertson, the American member of the Peiping Military Mediation Department, and Ye Jianying, the Communist member, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. That evening, they separately had long talks with Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai. On the morning of the 15th, they met with Marshal Ma again. At 3:30 PM, Ye Jianying left Nanjing to return to Peiping, while Robertson flew to Shanghai with Rooks, the head of the US Military Advisory Group in China.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Marshal Ma received Robertson, Zhou Enlai, and Ye Jianying at 10:30 AM on the 15th to discuss the Anping incident in detail. It is also rumored that the content of today's conversation may have involved the Peiping Military Mediation Department, because the work of the Executive Headquarters has obviously completely stalled. However, Marshal Ma is still carefully considering whether to abolish it or strengthen it. According to the opinions of some people, the only way to strengthen the work of the Executive Headquarters is to strengthen the power of the American mediation personnel, but it is naturally impossible to obtain the CCP's consent. Some people say that if the Executive Headquarters is indeed abolished, it will be when Marshal Ma formally expresses his failure in the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] It is learned that the CCP had sent a note to Marshal Ma regarding the Anping incident, explaining the actual situation. The outside world mostly does not know its content. Observers believe that the Anping incident was a major diplomatic failure for the CCP. Before this incident occurred, members of the US Congress had repeatedly discussed China policy, considering withdrawing troops and stopping the Lend-Lease Act and military aid to China. However, after the Anping incident occurred, Americans who sympathized with the CCP immediately changed their views. Therefore, the issues that were under consideration are no longer the focus of attention in the US government and public.</p>
<h3>Anping Incident Report</h3>
<h3>US and Communist Sides Argue Pointedly</h3>
<p>Twenty-Five Person Group to Meet Again Today</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] The Twenty-Five Person Group is scheduled to meet again on the morning of the 16th and may begin to hear testimony from Executive Headquarters staff Major Fritz and Duke, who were traveling in US military patrol vehicles. The investigation conducted by the group in the past two weeks has been very limited. Davis, in his preliminary report to Robertson, only pointed out the following points: (1) The opponent in the US Marine Corps conflict was probably the Communist army. (2) The location of the conflict was not regularly occupied by any troops or residents, but was farmland along the Peiping-Tianjin Highway, and anyone who appeared there at noon on July 29th was temporarily from elsewhere. (3) The commander of the Communist army participating in the conflict and the mission of his troops have not been determined. (4) The group has not obtained any evidence that the National Army participated in the conflict. As for the Communist representative Huang Yifeng, he explained Davis' report in his report: (1) Anping Town was originally a Communist army station, but has now been occupied by government troops. (2) The conflict location specified by the US participants Major Fritz and Duke has no traces of war. (3) The conflict location referred to by the US is a flat plain with open terrain and no deep trenches on both sides of the highway. (4) There are no wheelbarrows or deep pits obstructing progress in the US report. (5) There are no bunkers in the US report. The report of the government representative Zhang Shuheng did not mention the results of the on-site investigation.</p>
<h3>Chaotic and Serious Situation</h3>
<h3>Entirely Created by the CCP</h3>
<p>Nanyang Business Daily of Singapore Comments on the Current Situation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore Dispatch, 15th] An important Chinese newspaper here published an article this morning entitled "Who Should Be Responsible for the Failure of Peace Negotiations," stating that the CCP should be responsible for creating the chaotic and serious situation in our country, and believes that peace negotiations are indeed hopeless. Although a military solution will lead to disaster, it is not unimaginable. This move may at least save the people from long-term suffering. Also, all Chinese newspapers here today published the Chairman's message on the front page. This is the first time that overseas Chinese here have had the opportunity to read the original text of the leader's message issued on the same day.</p>
<h3>CCP Attacks Marshal Ma</h3>
<p>Zhou Enlai to Also Issue a Document</p>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the rumor that the CCP advocates submitting the China problem to the United Nations Security Council for resolution, Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesperson, said that it was only a rumor and could not be confirmed. When asked whether the CCP still advocates mediation by Marshall, Chen replied: This matter will be announced in Zhou Enlai's document. When reporters asked about the content of the document, Chen replied: "There is a document, but it probably will not be issued today. I am far away in Shanghai and cannot speculate." Chen denied the rumors that the CCP had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, calling them "rumors spread in Peiping that are completely untrue." Chen did not comment on the Chairman's message, only saying that under the current circumstances, the CCP maintaining silence may be more beneficial to the situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] People here generally believe that the Communist Party's vigorous attacks on Special Envoy Marshall are a prelude to the Communist Party's request for the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to jointly mediate the conflict in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Yan'an Liberation Daily editorial today publicly attacked Special Envoy Marshall for the first time, saying that he cannot shirk his responsibility for failing to stop the conflict in China. The newspaper also fiercely criticized American military aid to the Nationalist government. In the past, the Communist Party criticized the impropriety of American aid to China and the presence of US troops in China, while often complimenting Marshal Ma personally for his efforts in mediating peace. Now the tone has changed.</p>
<h3>Datong's North Gate Once Breached</h3>
<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds at Niangziguan</h3>
<h3>Communist Army in Eastern Henan Moves Along Longhai Road</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 15th] A fierce battle is unfolding at Niangziguan. Around 2:00 PM on the 14th, the Communist army launched a fierce attack on the station with more than 7,000 troops. The fierce battle was still ongoing until the evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 15th] About two regiments of Communist troops in Shanxi attempted to actively sabotage the Zhengtai Railway and launched a fierce attack on Yangyi Town east of Taigu. Although our defending troops dealt a heavy blow, they were occupied due to the disparity in numbers.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The situation in Datong is critical. The North Gate was once breached by the Communist army besieging the city. The battle at Shacen is fierce and unprecedented. The Pingwang Airport is still in the hands of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Military news: The Datong battle is still ongoing intermittently on the periphery. The government still secures the airport. The statement that the battle has been extended to the city is inaccurate. However, officials announced today that a cannonball landed near the residence of a group in the city.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Official sources say that Liu Bocheng is now leading an army of 100,000 troops, advancing and retreating in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. His troops have captured Lanfeng and arrived at Xinglongji, pressing on Kaifeng. Official intelligence says that Liu has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Communist army in North China and the commander-in-chief of the Peiping-Hankou Railway. Those who moved out at the same time as Liu Bocheng also included Cheng Yuan's unit attacking Huangkou Station and Dangshan and the New Fourth Army attacking Sixian. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops were found in Guguzhai, 30 miles southeast of Xinxiang, northern Henan, yesterday morning. According to an analysis by a qualified person, the Communist army's move is to cut off the connection between the Nationalist army in the protruding area of northern Henan (Anyang Xinxiang) and the Nationalist army south of the Yellow River, and to threaten Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] The Military Mediation Department is extremely concerned about the conflict in eastern Henan and plans to order the Xinxiang Tenth Group to send a subgroup to Kaifeng to curb the conflict.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng Dispatch, 15th] Liu Bocheng's Communist army is now advancing along the Longhai Railway in the eastern and western areas of Kaocheng Lanfeng. In addition to destroying the Longhai Railway, their purpose is to prepare to breach the old Yellow River dike (between Kaocheng and Lanfeng) to create a second northern Jiangsu to assist them militarily.</p>
<h3>Changchun Implements Temporary Alert</h3>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo and Zhang Yuanbin Pass Through Shenyang and Arrive in Peiping</h3>
<h3>Request Military Mediation Department to Stop Disturbances in Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, arrived in Peiping yesterday, accompanied by Zhang Yuanbin, Director-General of the Third Depot, and Liu Bozhong, Director of the Third Division of the Command. According to Zheng, he came from Changchun through Shenyang yesterday morning after asking Commander Du, who had returned to Shenyang the night before, for instructions. His mission is to personally explain to the Military Mediation Department the Communist army's recent troop movements and disturbances in the Northeast and its active destruction of traffic, and to request that they find a way to stop it. Moreover, representatives of the people of Kaiyuan and Fengcheng counties have requested that the National Army quickly recover them. This will also be discussed with the Military Mediation Department. Zheng attended a banquet hosted by Li Zongren at noon on the 15th to exchange views on military issues inside and outside the customs. According to Director-General Zhang Yuanbin, the winter clothing of hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in the Northeast has reached the stage of active preparation. The task of this trip is to deal with this. In addition to dealing with the Fifth Supply Zone here, he will also go to Tianjin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin Dispatch, 15th] According to reports, the Changchun Garrison Department convened an emergency military meeting on the morning of the 14th and immediately issued an emergency order: All officers and soldiers of the Changchun National Army are not allowed to leave the barracks. After 11:00 PM, all traffic will be stopped, and no one is allowed to walk outside. Theaters and dance halls have been carefully searched. After noon, guards were stationed at major intersections, and armed patrols patrolled the streets. The period of validity of this emergency order and special alert is three days, from the 15th to the 17th. The authorities issued this emergency order because they received information that the Communist Party may cause large-scale riots in Changchun within three days. According to another Changchun telegram, three government planes flew over important cities in the Northeast yesterday morning, dropping leaflets. The planes departed from Shenyang, and leaflets were also dropped in Harbin, which is controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Military news: Lin Biao's unit of more than 10,000 people in the Kuping and Faku area has the intention of attacking Faku. The war in Taipingchuan near Hailong is still fierce. The US and government representatives of the Hailong Twenty-Ninth Group went to inspect, but were still unable to eliminate the war.</p>
<h3>War Clouds Loom Over Chahar Province</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Official sources: War clouds loom over Chahar Province. Important materials are being transported to Fuyuan and Yuxian. The printing press of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank is being transported to Fuping. Reporters have learned that the situation in Nankou is also quite tense. If the war expands further, it will spread to Chahar Province.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 15th] (1) It is rumored that Li Xiannian, commander of the Communist army in the Central Plains Region, and Wang Zhen, chief of staff, have secretly gone to northern Shaanxi, but it has not yet been confirmed whether they have arrived. The Communist army under Li's command is now commanded by Wen Jianwu and is still divided into the border between Shaanxi and Henan. (2) The remaining Communist troops hiding in the Dahong Mountains have recently been reorganized and forcibly crossed the Xiang River. One group has fled to Shiqiao Station, north of Jingmen.</p>
<h3>Liaocheng Besieged for Eight Months</h3>
<h3>Food and Fuel Exhausted</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 15th] Liaocheng has been besieged for more than eight months. The Communist army's blockade of supplies has become increasingly severe. Food and fuel for the military and civilians in the city have been exhausted, and their lives are not guaranteed. More than 100 representatives of the people of the county went to various party, government, and military agencies on the morning of the 15th to petition, crying and begging to send troops to lift the siege and first send food by air to save lives.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Buries Himself in School Affairs</h3>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 15th] Since Ambassador Stuart returned to Peiping on the 13th, he has had little contact with the outside world because he has many school affairs to deal with.

<p>[Our Taizhou Dispatch, 15th] The war on the eastern front of northern Jiangsu has suddenly become tense since the Communist army concentrated more than ten regiments of troops to launch a fierce attack on the Haian and Libao line, taking advantage of the National Army's troop deployment.

<h3>To Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis: Chairman Approves and Submits to the Executive Yuan for Consultation and Handling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 15th] Recently, people in industrial and commercial circles in the valleys of Jing, Hu, and Hang (Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou), recognizing that the crisis in their respective industries is deepening, have requested the government to provide relief. Chairman Chiang is very concerned about this. After listening to the report of Chief Clerk Wu Wendingchang and others, he has approved and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, ordering the relevant ministries and committees to consult and handle it. According to Chief Clerk Wu, the contents of the petitions from industrial and commercial circles in various places can be summarized into four major points. The government can accept most of them with slight revisions. However, one suggestion involves organizing an industrial investment company to develop industries, because the original proposal involved using Chinese people's deposits abroad as capital. This move requires the consent of the owners in accordance with the law, so it needs to be considered carefully.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Chairman, Supporting the Points Revealed in the Proclamation; Also Telegraphs Mao Zedong, Calling for Unified Compilation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Yesterday (the 15th), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Chairman Chiang, supporting the points revealed in the Chairman's message to the people of the whole country. At the same time, it also telegraphed Mao Zedong, urging him to immediately order his subordinates to implement unified compilation. The two telegrams are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Respectfully, Chairman Chiang, Kuling National Government: In recent months, the domestic situation has become increasingly tense, with the possibility of expansion and spread at any time. People at home are informing each other in alarm, fearing the collapse of the building. International observations and friendly foreign public opinion are also shocked and suspicious. Since reading in the newspaper Your Excellency's message to the people of the whole country on the 13th, revealing six points of future policy, with a selfless spirit, expressing the determination to start with the people, no matter how variable and dark the future is, with Your Excellency's sincere and frank proclamation, those who gloat will lose their tools of boasting, and those who hope for governance will strengthen their inclinations. It will not be difficult to transform hostility into peace and put the people at ease. On behalf of the city's industry and commerce, I express my heartfelt support.</p>
<p>Telegram to Mr. Mao Zedong</p>
<p>Respected Mr. Mao Zedong, Yan'an: Domestic consultations and mediation have dragged on for years, and peaceful unification has not yet yielded results, while the scourge of war has spread throughout the north of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, leaving the whole country at a loss and the world in fear. I read the Marshall joint declaration and learned that the crux of the problem lies in the Communist Army's refusal to withdraw and the insistence on setting up separatist regimes in the withdrawn areas, resulting in a deadlock in peace talks and causing economic collapse, which is an inevitable fact that every Chinese citizen is heartbroken about. Since the ceasefire and unified compilation already have a resolution based on political consultation, why should we inflict more suffering on our people and ruin the country's foundation? I represent the public opinion of the entire industrial and commercial community in Shanghai, and I appeal to you. I hope that you will immediately order your subordinates to withdraw from the railway lines, restore traffic, and implement unified compilation, so that the obstacles to peaceful unification can be eliminated and the crisis of economic collapse can be avoided, ending the separation and confrontation of more than 30 years, and ensuring the long-term stability of Shenzhou. Your great achievements will surely be recorded in history. Strive for this moment for the sake of the country and the party. I offer my sincere advice and hope you will adopt it.</p>
<h3>McKee and Powell Assigned to Come to China from the United States</h3>

<h3>National Army Transit No Longer Through Hong Kong; Transit Agreement Terminated Yesterday; Military Agencies to Close Offices</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] From today, Chinese troops will no longer use Hong Kong as a transit point. After Japan's surrender, the Chinese government established an agreement with the Hong Kong government to use Hong Kong as a transit center for the Chinese military for one year. Now, Chairman Chiang has ordered its termination. In the past year, approximately 200,000 Chinese troops have been transferred through Hong Kong to various ports in North China. The authorities specifically requisitioned hundreds of houses in the Kowloon area to accommodate the Chinese troops. The homeowners have been notified that they can recover the houses for their own use this month. The Hong Kong government also supplied the food for the Chinese troops waiting for ships during transit. There are still approximately 2,000 Chinese troops waiting for ships in Kowloon. If ships are not available for a while, they will go to Guangzhou to wait. In addition, it is understood that the offices of the Chinese Army and the Military Affairs Department's special envoy in Hong Kong will also be closed. The transfer of enemy property in Hong Kong to this office is considerable, including 15,000 tons of ships and 80 vehicles of various types.</p>
<h3>Our Trial of War Criminals: Judicial Administration Has Drafted and Finalized the Plan; Takashi Sakai Scheduled for Public Trial on the 20th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Takashi Sakai, the war criminal who ravaged Hong Kong, is scheduled to be retried in Beijing on the 20th. Tani Hisao, the culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, will also be tried here in the near future. A reporter visited Minister Xie of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and Director Yang of the Criminal Department to learn about the various situations related to the trial of war crimes: The Ministry of Judicial Administration began handling the lawsuits against enemy war criminals last winter. Initially, there were only a few thousand, but as more cases were sent from various places, they were organized and sent to the War Criminals Handling Committee of the Ministry of National Defense (including representatives from the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, and the Military Law Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters) for handling. Some were sent to the Tokyo Far East National Defense Military Tribunal for reference and joint processing, or handed over to military tribunals in various places to begin investigation. However, the biggest difficulty in this matter is the lack of established laws to be cited and followed. Therefore, this Ministry has compiled various materials and drafted the "War Criminals Trial Measures" in accordance with the principles of international law, as the basis for the trial of war criminals. It has already been discussed by the committee in several meetings and will be finalized soon. The investigation of the Nanjing Massacre is currently being carried out by the War Criminals Handling Committee and the Municipal Council to collect material and human evidence. Once the preparatory work is completed, the public trial that the people of the whole country are looking forward to can begin, washing away the shocking stain in human history.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Takashi Sakai has been scheduled by the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense to be publicly tried in Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 20th. The trial will be held in the auditorium of the Lizi Society on Huangpu Road. More than 500 pieces of important evidence related to the case have been collected. The presiding judge will be Shi Meiyu. Vice President Yu Xuezhong of the Military Senate, the wife of Central Committee member Zou Lu, and Gao Xingya, an officer of the Central Statistics Bureau, have been invited to testify. The defense attorney for the defendant is still Wang Long.</p>
<h3>Famous Chinese Architect Hou Xiangchen Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 15th] Hou Liangchen, a famous engineer in China's architectural field, passed away in Chengdu on the 12th at the age of 70.

The Summer Palace in Beijing and the mausoleums of Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi were all supervised by him personally. He once hand-painted a book of "Xiangchen Architectural Drawings".</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Chairman Changes Departure Date for Inspection</h3>

The route will be to first inspect Xiaoshan and Changxing, then to Shaoxing for a brief stay, then to Yuyao, Shangyu, Cixi, Ningbo, Fenghua, Zhenhai, Dinghai and other places, for a period of half a month.</p>
<p>Local Correspondences</p>
<h3>Military Grain Allocation Must Not Be Delayed: Jiangsu Provincial Government Pre-collects Land Tax</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang Express News] On the 13th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed relevant counties that the previously purchased military grain had been transferred to merchants with the approval of the Central Government. Except for those counties, districts, townships, and bao that have already been collected, which should still be transported to the designated warehouse or supply station, the rest are allowed to be exempted from pursuit. However, military grain for August and September of this year will be collected in advance from land tax to meet urgent needs. Because the environment in northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer, the allocation of military grain must not be delayed. All previously determined pre-collection measures must be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Donations to Relieve Refugees in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The county government in this district believes that the refugees in northern Jiangsu are fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River, without clothes or food, and their situation is extremely miserable, and should be relieved as much as possible. After convening a meeting, it was decided that the person in charge of each entertainment venue will add 50 yuan to each ticket for donations to relieve refugees, starting on the 12th. It is stipulated that the donations will be sent to the county government for transfer every five days.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Enemy Puppet Secret Agent Arrested and Sent to Changzhou</p>
<p>Zhang Tingqian, also known as Jin Geng, a 27-year-old resident of No. 16 Nanshi Bridge Alley in the city, who runs a hot water shop, is from Yancheng, northern Jiangsu. During the fall of Wuxi, he served as a secret agent and translator for the enemy's Kempeitai Sasaki Garrison. He was a cohort of the fleeing Jin Renchu and was unscrupulous in his actions. Recently, Zhang was carrying a short gun, posing as a special agent, and entering theaters to cause trouble with the gun. This was discovered by the City Defense Headquarters, which arrested Zhang. On the 14th, he was sent to the First Pacification Zone Command in Changzhou for strict handling.</p>
<p>Mingguang</p>
<p>Northeast Anhui Supervision Group Leaves Mingguang</p>

The heads of various agencies in the county welcomed them at the station.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Case of Fraud in Collection of Business Tax</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Yunbo of Sijing Town in this county reported that the local Direct Tax Bureau sent a group of three people, Zhang Fengchi and Wang Guangrun, to Sijing to collect business tax at the beginning of last month. After the actual collection figures for each industry were determined, such as the silk and cloth industry paying 2.3 million yuan and the sundries industry paying 2.7 million yuan, the silk and cloth industry was given temporary receipts, while the sundries industry was not. After Zhang and others finished collecting taxes in the entire town, they held a banquet for the Town Chamber of Commerce and the leaders of various guilds, but not many people attended enthusiastically. Before leaving, they took back all the temporary receipts that had been issued and handed the official receipts for each industry to the Town Chamber of Commerce staff for distribution to each guild. As a result, the verification results of each industry were vastly different from the actual payment figures. The sundries industry's 2.7 million yuan only had receipts for 1.5 million yuan, while the silk and cloth industry's 2.3 million yuan only had receipts for 1.03 million yuan. Most other industries were similar. Therefore, evidence was collected, the facts were presented, and the matter was reported. The Ministry of Finance's Direct Tax Bureau was requested to investigate thoroughly. The bureau sent people to Sijing to investigate and found that the fraud was true, and submitted a report for verification.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Fire at the Great World Cinema</p>
<p>At around 11 PM on the 13th, a fire broke out in the three-story open-air cinema of the Great World in West Lake in this city. During the screening of a movie, the technician accidentally caused a short circuit, and the burning celluloid film and wires caught fire. At that time, the audience at the scene panicked and rushed to the exit, causing chaos. They rushed towards the drama theater, and a large number of spectators scrambled downstairs. Unexpectedly, the stairs were not very sturdy, and the stairs collapsed under excessive load with a loud crash. An old woman died on the spot, and 21 others were slightly or seriously injured, who were sent to the hospital by the police.</p>
<h3>International Intervention? Or Public Judgment?</h3>
<p>—We oppose the former and advocate for the latter—</p>
<p>The government and the Chinese Communists (CCP) are locked in unresolved disputes, and mediation has yet to succeed. Consequently, two different arguments have recently emerged. The CCP is loudly advocating for international intervention, while the *China Times* proposes that both the Kuomintang (KMT) and CCP should listen to the people's opinions at this time, as this is the highest form of public judgment. Our newspaper's editorial on the 12th offered more specific suggestions for a national conference, naturally advocating for public judgment. Today, we further explain our reasons for opposing international intervention.</p>
<p>After Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement, opinions varied, but everyone recognized it as a serious warning from friendly nations to both sides. This indicated that peace negotiations had reached a critical point, yet there was still hope that both sides would reflect deeply and achieve profound understanding to avert national disaster. When Chairman Chiang issued a statement the day before yesterday, solemnly declaring his consistent stance of resolving political disputes through political means, everyone believed that the prospects for peace had not yet reached an impasse. However, observing the CCP's expressions in recent days is truly disheartening, making us genuinely pessimistic about the future of peace.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the *Agence France-Presse* in Nanjing on the 12th stated: "According to reliable sources, CCP representative Zhou Enlai informed Special Envoy Marshall this morning that if peace cannot be achieved under the current circumstances, the Chinese issue will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for resolution. At the same time, CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan also brazenly explained the CCP's reasons for advocating submitting the Chinese issue to the United Nations, claiming that since Britain and the Soviet Union were signatories to the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference declaration of December last year, they should have equal standing with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations." A dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 14th stated that the *Liberation Daily* in Yan'an published an editorial on the 13th, which, in addition to attacking Special Envoy Marshall, also made similar claims. If these two dispatches are entirely accurate, then we must first point out to our readers that the CCP representatives' preposterous and erroneous arguments conceal cowardice, selfishness, and malicious intentions.</p>
<p>After the victorious conclusion of our nation's war of resistance, every descendant of the Yellow Emperor, every patriotic son and daughter, fervently hoped that our motherland could quickly achieve unification and become a great power, not only to survive gloriously among the nations but also to faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, in order to fulfill its responsibility to maintain world peace, and to be worthy of being one of the Four or Five Great Powers. However, the result of the year since the victory of the war of resistance is that this common dream of the entire nation has almost completely shattered. Not only is the status of one of the Four or Five Great Powers wavering, but also we cannot handle our own domestic affairs, and we must trouble two mediators from friendly nations to run around and mediate. After ten months, mediation is not yet hopeless, but the CCP suddenly has a whimsical idea, advocating for submitting its own affairs for the United Nations to handle. It is not enough to sweep the nation's face and national character into the dust. The CCP only considers the self-interest of a single party from the perspective of a faction, without thinking about the interests of the entire nation. Isn't this counterproductive action cutting itself off from the people of the country?</p>
<p>It is obvious that the CCP does not want the nation to be unified and powerful, so let us put that aside for the moment. If we observe the CCP's suggestion from the perspective of international law, we also find it childish to the point of being ludicrous. First, the United Nations is an international organization. The purpose of the Security Council is to promote the creation and maintenance of international peace and security, and its method emphasizes resolving all international disputes through peaceful means. It has no right to handle the internal disputes of various countries. Even if a country degenerates and wants to submit its domestic problems to the Security Council, only the sole legitimate central government recognized by all countries can file a complaint. No other party can appeal to the United Nations. Second, because the permanent members of the Security Council can exercise the "veto power" when dealing with international disputes, whether it is an effective mechanism for peacefully resolving international disputes is still a serious question. Submitting the Chinese issue to the United Nations will not only waste time but also increase international conflicts. Third, China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. If it submits its own domestic disputes for discussion, China's position in the international community will plummet. The world's people's perception of China will be unimaginable. Only those who are willing to degenerate and lower their national character would support this shameless proposition. No wonder the person in charge of the Chinese Youth Party publicly declared his opposition.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Wang Bingnan's statement that Britain and the Soviet Union should have equal status with the United States in the Chinese peace negotiations, the reasoning he relies on is also specious. First, the US government sent Special Envoy Marshall to China to mediate the KMT-CCP negotiations, so that China could create a peaceful, unified, and democratic country as soon as possible. This is a consistent US policy towards China, not based on the decision of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow. Second, China did not attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The Chinese government's opinion was not sought in advance for the decision made on the Chinese issue, and the Chinese government had no intention of recognizing it afterward. China certainly does not accept the constraints of this resolution. Third, the United States' mediation of the Chinese peace negotiations has been unanimously agreed to and welcomed by the Chinese government and the public, and the British government has already stated that it is unwilling to mediate the Chinese internal disputes. Why should we force other countries to come forward to mediate? Fourth, the independence of Korea, which was recognized in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference agreement, has not yet been implemented. The US authorities are expressing dissatisfaction. What value does it have as a basis for interfering in the Chinese issue?</p>
<p>In short, the CCP representatives are not unaware of the above reasons, but in reality, they have other ambitions. To put it bluntly, the CCP is trying every means to open a door for international intervention, not only wanting to lower China's international status, making it a country that no one cares about, but also to turn China into a second Spain, with endless wars. In this way, the CCP can take advantage of the chaos to achieve its own selfish desires. Therefore, the CCP representatives put forward this absurd proposition after the issuance of the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, but it is a kind of propaganda offensive, attempting to confuse domestic and international audiences, and has no substantive significance, and there is fundamentally no value in studying it. We hope that if the CCP still has a concept of the nation, it should immediately implement the plans for unified compilation of troops and the restoration of transportation. If not, it can also attend the upcoming Lushan Conference and listen to the public judgment. This is the right path.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Presides Over the Peace Conference, Finnish Representative Attends and Delivers a Speech, Requests a Reduction in the Excessive Reparations to the Soviet Union, Hopes to Obtain a Stable Foundation for Independent Existence From Now On</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th - The Peace Conference continued its meeting at 10:05 this morning, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie taking the chair for three days in rotation. After Foreign Minister Wang delivered a speech in English, Czech representative Masaryk followed up with a speech explaining his country's views on the Hungarian Foreign Minister's speech. When the Peace Conference resumed at 3:05 p.m. (Paris time), the Finnish delegation was invited to enter the chamber. Finnish Foreign Minister Enckell then took the podium and spoke in fluent French, first thanking the conference for allowing him to express his views. He then stated that Finland has always been at the forefront of democracy. After signing the armistice agreement, the Finnish people immediately declared war on Germany and eventually drove the Germans out of the country, but it was achieved at a heavy sacrifice. The true will of the Finnish people can be seen from this. Regarding Soviet-Finnish relations, Enckell said that for the sake of peace in that part of Europe, it is necessary for the two countries to cooperate permanently. Finland is willing to carefully implement the armistice agreement, but Finland is a defeated country and is now encountering various major difficulties in fulfilling the peace treaty. Finland has lost most of the important central province of Viipuri, occupying 23,000 square kilometers. A large number of residents have to be relocated, and their property on the ground has been damaged, which has delayed the reconstruction work and the payment of debts. In addition, Finland lost Petsamo, which has special importance to the Finnish people's economic life, and Porkkala, near the Finnish capital of Helsinki. Due to the importance of these land concessions, Finland hopes that the relevant territorial clauses in the peace treaty can be eased in the end. The points where the armistice agreement affects the Finnish people's economic life have been detailed in the memorandum submitted to the conference. Finland's production capacity has been ravaged by two wars, and the reparations to the Soviet Union are as high as 300 million US dollars. Without external support, it is truly powerless to pay and unable to maintain its domestic living standards and restore its production capacity, because Finland cannot expect to improve its foreign trade. Enckell hopes that the reparations can be reduced by 100 million US dollars, so that there may be greater certainty in fulfilling the treaty. The Finnish representative finally expressed his gratitude to the great powers, such as the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy. He wished that the morality of eternal friendship between the Soviet and Finnish peoples would begin from this point onward, and at the same time hoped to give Finland a stable foundation for independent existence.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th - Representatives of Cuba, Albania, Mexico, and Egypt will be invited to present their respective views at the plenary session this Saturday.</p>

<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Expresses Opinions, Pleads for Minority Nationalities</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi, following Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev, presented his views at the Peace Conference today, requesting assistance for the oppressed Hungarian minorities in Romania and Czechoslovakia. He also stated that Hungary finds it difficult to recognize the ceding of Outer Transylvania to Romania. Gyöngyösi declared that democratic Hungary has risen from the turmoil of war, but even today, human rights are completely disregarded, and countless Hungarians are often expelled from Czechoslovakia within hours, with only their personal belongings. Approximately 650,000 Hungarians in Slovakia have been deprived of their citizenship and the most basic human rights, and their goods have been confiscated. The plight of more than 1.5 million Hungarians in Romania and Czechoslovakia since the end of the war is disturbing. Chairman Byrnes immediately ordered the secretary-general to escort the Hungarian delegation out of the meeting. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk then declared that "the Czech delegation intends to study this astonishing and unprecedented speech by the Hungarian Foreign Minister and respond to it tomorrow morning. Earlier, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kulishev spoke, requesting Greece to return the province of Western Thrace. This request was supported by Ukrainian representative Manuilsky. Greek representative Tsaldaris immediately refuted it, strongly arguing that the Four Foreign Ministers' draft treaty was not severe enough on Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>World Women's Representatives Demand to Participate in the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Mrs. Rogers, the American representative of the World Women's Equal Rights Party, arrived in London today, demanding that the Paris Peace Conference allow women representatives to participate. Mrs. Rogers believes that women from all countries should have a seat in the Peace Conference, and women should also have a voice in the future of the world.</p>
<h3>Committee Established for Italian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>Trieste Issue is the Most Troublesome</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] The committee for the Italian Peace Treaty was established this morning. The Trieste issue is one of the most difficult, with complex opinions among the four powers and no consensus on how to handle the port of Trieste. The committee also needs to deal with the former Italian colonies and the issue of Italian reparations. These issues are also quite difficult, but not as much as the Trieste issue.</p>
<h3>France is Willing to Rebuild Friendly Relations with Italy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Paris, 15th Emergency Broadcast: French President Pidu has just declared: France hopes to rebuild peaceful and friendly relations with Italy.</p>
<h3>Byrnes' Speech in Response to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Says the United States Has Absolutely No Territorial Desires and is Willing to Help Countries With Economic Recovery</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the Peace Conference today, apparently directed at the Soviet Union, stating that economic treaties concluded in violation of the Potsdam Agreement will lead to "enslavement and adventure." At the same time, Byrnes expressed his disagreement with the Soviet claim that some countries had become wealthy during the war. "Which great power has become wealthy during the war? I know definitively that no country has." I hope that the Soviet spokesman is not referring to the 10 billion US dollars in public lending from the United States. Before the offensive, President Roosevelt announced that the United States would be a symbol of democracy. The United States did not ask for compensation, but only asked for freedom for all mankind. The United States also does not ask for territory or compensation. The United States now wants to help any country's economic recovery.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Deploy Troops on the Border, Iranian Army Implements Alert, Soviet Troops are Concentrating in the Port of Odessa, Intentions Against Britain or Against Turkey are Unclear</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 14th] The Central Government Army of 15,800 today implemented an alert in Qazvin, because it was heard that the Democrats of Azerbaijan were concentrating one hundred miles north of that location. The reason for the Democrats' concentration is unknown, but some people say that this is "to prevent accidents." The British Consul General, who was summoned to Tehran by the British Ambassador to Iran to discuss British-Iranian relations, has returned to his residence. Since the news of the appearance of British cruisers in the Persian Gulf spread last month, it has been rumored that Soviet troops are concentrating on the Azerbaijani border. These messages are neither verifiable nor deniable. The Iranian Minister of the Army told the Associated Press reporter that we cannot understand the truth of the local situation, because we have no direct contact with the Soviet-Azerbaijani border.</p>
<p>[United Press, 14th] Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala declared today: He has received news of the Soviet Union concentrating troops in the Caucasus region north of Iran, but the report does not indicate the purpose of concentrating troops. Are these troops used to counter British pressure on Iran in the south, or is it because the Soviet Union has made new demands for direct control of the Dardanelles, exerting pressure on Turkey? This move has caused a serious situation among Britain, Iraq, and Iran. Diplomatic circles here are also rumored that the Soviet Union has concentrated some troops in the area of the Black Sea port of Odessa, and its purpose is also unknown.</p>
<h3>Turkey Submits Reply, Rejects Soviet Demands, The Spirit of the Montreux Convention, Signatory Countries Cannot Violate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 14th] Well-informed sources announced today that the Turkish government has submitted a reply, firmly rejecting the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention to allow the Black Sea countries to jointly manage the Dardanelles Strait and to jointly protect it by the Soviet Union and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Well-informed sources said that Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union's note requesting amendments to the Montreux Convention refutes the claim that Turkey violated the Convention during the war. The Soviet government's note pointed out that during the war, the Turkish government allowed German and Italian patrol boats and auxiliary ships to pass through the straits into the Black Sea, which was a violation of the Convention. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that the Montreux Convention was not sufficient to protect the safety of the Black Sea during the war and must be revised so that the Soviet Union can jointly be responsible with Turkey for the defense of the straits. Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that during the war, if Turkey is not a belligerent, it should not allow warships of belligerent countries to pass through the straits. Therefore, the problem lies in how to define warships. The Turkish government's reply should point out that the Axis ships passing through the straits were not warships as defined in the Convention. Chapter 1 of the Annex to the Convention defines warships based on the definition of the London Naval Treaty of March 1, 1936.</p>
<p>Turkish President İnönü</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Announces Documents, Accusing Turkey of Colluding with Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet government recently announced several documents copied from the former German Foreign Ministry files, proving that Turkey had colluded with Germany, one of which was a telegram signed by Gilling, the former German Minister to Romania, mentioning the conversation between the German Foreign Minister and the Turkish Ambassador to Romania in Bucharest. The Turkish Ambassador stated that although Turkey would continue to strictly maintain neutrality, it would always regard the Soviet Union as a major enemy. Another document involved the conversation between the German Plenipotentiary Minister Henting and Galon, a special envoy sent by the former Turkish Army Chief of Staff, Çolak. Çolak said that the conflict between Turkey and the Soviet Union was almost inevitable. Once the Turkish military was completed, the war would begin. Turkey's offensive was planned to go through the Iranian plateau directly to the Baku oil source. In addition, the former German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, informed the German Foreign Ministry that Çolak proposed that some Turkish citizens familiar with the Caucasus situation should be sent to Germany. On the other hand, Çolak expressed his willingness to dismiss some Caucasus and Azerbaijani officers to comply with German intentions. Çolak also told Papen that the Soviet Union had completed various aircraft factories in Kiseovsk and Tomsk and installed various equipment in the Ufa oil fields.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 14th] The Turkish government stated in its reply that Turkey cannot sign new agreements with a small number of countries to replace the 1936 Convention. In short, the Turkish government will still abide by the spirit of the Montreux Convention and believes that this is the only diplomatic document governing the Dardanelles Strait and cannot be violated.</p>
<h3>US and British Statement on Attitude</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Regarding the Soviet Union's note to Turkey regarding the Dardanelles Strait, according to diplomatic circles, not only is the United States unable to accept it, but also any other signatory to the Montreux Convention is unable to accept it. The Soviet Union's proposal seems to have returned to 19th-century diplomacy, in which there is not a single word about the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman declared that Britain cannot agree to any steps taken by the Soviet Union in order for the Soviet Union and Turkey to conduct direct negotiations on the straits issue. Political observers here believe that the British government will take a tough stance on this matter, which is clear evidence of this.</p>
<h3>We Buy More of the US Surplus Ships</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The Naval Committee declared that China has requested to purchase the largest portion of the 1,389 surplus merchant ships specified for sale, 159 ships.</p>
<h3>On the Palestine Issue, the United States Proposes a Compromise Plan, The British Cabinet Will Convene a Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Authoritative sources said: President Truman has approved the compromise plan for the Palestine issue proposed by Acting Secretary of State Acheson as the basis for discussion with both the Jewish and Arab communities. The US President has sent this plan directly to British Prime Minister Attlee, saying that if this can be the basis for negotiations with the Jewish and Arab communities, the United States is willing to provide moral assistance. It is understood that the plan still supports the partition of Palestine, but the area of the Jewish province is larger than originally proposed by British and American experts, and the Jewish province also has greater autonomy on issues such as immigration taxes.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] According to well-informed and responsible Foreign Office officials, President Truman today opposed the plan of the British-American Committee to establish a federal system in Palestine. Therefore, Britain feels that it is necessary to find a new solution to the Palestine issue. The President's note stated that the United States cannot accept or oppose this plan for the time being without the support of the people. Britain, as the mandatory power, should adapt to the environment and take wise actions.</p>
<h3>Palestinian Terrorist Actions</h3>
<p>Illegal Immigrants Continue to Enter</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 15th Broadcast: Palestinian terrorist actions are becoming more intense. Within 16 hours, the Palestinian General Post Office received two phone calls claiming that a bomb would explode in the Post Office Building soon, causing staff to flee and postal and telecommunications traffic to be cut off for more than an hour, but no bombs were found. Other agencies also received similar calls.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 14th] A Jewish Agency spokesman recently declared: There are currently two ships carrying a total of 1,300 illegal immigrants. Another ship is said to have approached Haifa and will be seized when it enters Palestinian territorial waters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 14th] A Polish Foreign Office spokesman declared today: Since the beginning of July, 25,000 Jews have illegally left Poland. The Polish government has issued a total of 4,764 exit passports.</p>
<p>Anniversary of Japan's Surrender</p>
<h3>My Prosecutor Accuses in Court: Atrocities of the Japanese Army in China, American Reporters Guth Continue to Testify Yesterday, Reverend Magin Speaks of the Nanjing Massacre</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from To-a Company, Tokyo, 15th] Today marks the anniversary of Emperor Hirohito's radio address to the nation announcing Japan's surrender last year. Former Foreign Minister Tōgō, who advocated for peace during the Imperial Conference, and General Umezu, the Chief of the General Staff who supported Army Minister Anami, are both prisoners of war on this historic day, sitting side by side in the defendant's dock at the International Tribunal. Former American reporter stationed in Peiping, Guth, continued to testify today, first recounting the establishment of puppet regimes by the Japanese in Peiping, Nanjing, and Mengjiang, as well as their economic aggression. He stated that all factories in Shanxi Province were operated by the Japanese army, while in other areas, the "North China Development Company" in North China and the "Central China Promotion Company" in Central China monopolized everything. Subsequently, my prosecutor, Mr. Xiang Zhexun, in fluent English, accused the Japanese army of atrocities, stating: "What I wish to discuss today is a portion of the general acts of cruelty and crimes against humanity. This includes murder, torture, rape, robbery, unlawful destruction, etc. From 1937 to 1945, the Japanese army committed these inhumane crimes in the occupied areas of China, the most prominent of which was the Nanjing Massacre. Japanese soldiers committed this atrocity with the consent of their commanders and the Tokyo headquarters, in an attempt to permanently eliminate China's will to resist. This is the Japanese way of warfare. Furthermore, Japan used narcotics as part of its plan to conquer China. In short, Japan's policy of poisoning China aimed to reduce the physical strength of the Chinese people, weaken their resistance, and obtain the vast funds needed for military and economic aggression." Following Mr. Xiang's statement, Reverend John Magin, who resided in Nanjing from 1912 to 1940, testified, recounting the rape and looting committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing, stating that the atrocities committed by the Japanese army against the citizens of Nanjing during the occupation were beyond words to describe.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] The International Military Tribunal began today to examine the economic aggression crimes of the Japanese Zaibatsu. American writer Guth testified, stating that the Japanese army established puppet governments in North China, looting at will and controlling the economic lifeline of the Chinese people. Defense attorney Roh rebutted, stating that Chief Justice Webb had declared on July 24th that "economic aggression is not a crime." Webb sternly replied, "If it is linked to aggression, it is certainly a crime." Economic crimes are the fourth stage of the indictment. Propaganda campaigns, the Manchurian Incident, and the North China Incident have already been indicted. Prosecutor-General Keenan indicated that the investigation will be divided into twelve stages and will be completed by the end of September of this year.</p>
<h3>Longevity Secrets Under Study by American Professor, 400 Subjects</h3>

The trial period is set for five years, and a total of 400 people have volunteered to be tested by the professor, mostly university students aged 18 to 20.</p>

<p>The British government has decided to abolish capital punishment for five years starting from January 1949.</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt had a minor car accident in Yonkers on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Many State Department Officials Dismissed, Salaries of Diplomats Increased, Diplomatic Institute Established to Train New Talent</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The State Department today released a letter from Bernath to Congressman Smathers, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, stating that forty State Department civil servants with close ties to foreign governments have been dismissed. Rumors that these civil servants were dismissed due to communist tendencies, communist activities, or being members of the Communist Party, numbering thousands or even hundreds, are inaccurate. Bernath's letter also stated that 4,000 civil servants from other government agencies were transferred to the State Department for employment, of which 3,000 have been reviewed and 285 were deemed unsuitable for long-term employment, including 79 who have already been dismissed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman signed a law today increasing the annual salaries of top-level diplomats from $17,500 to $25,000 to enable American diplomats to strive for peace more effectively. This move by the President is the biggest reform of the American diplomatic service in 22 years. The law also increases the annual salaries of lower-level diplomats to $13,500. In addition, it stipulates the establishment of a diplomatic institute, modeled after the military academies, to train diplomatic talent. Members of the embassy staff will return to the country for training every two years to familiarize themselves with the domestic situation. Diplomatic personnel with poor performance will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Historical Materials on the Iranian Issue</h3>
<p>— ——Compiled by our Editorial Department——</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, the Iranian issue has consistently been an important international problem. During the United Nations General Assembly in January of this year, Britain and the Soviet Union engaged in a fierce debate over the Iranian issue, and it was later decided that the Soviet Union and Iran would negotiate directly. When the United Nations Security Council opened, the United States and Britain included the Iranian issue on the agenda, which led to the Soviet representative withdrawing from the meeting, forming a serious crisis for the United Nations.</p>
<p>Later, the problem resolved itself. Now, several months later, the situation in Iran has become tense again, because the Soviet Union and Britain have both deployed troops on the Iranian border, and the Iranian army has also been mobilized. The situation, resources, and various post-war events related to Iran are comprehensively described as follows:</p>
<p>Iran's oldest name was "Parthia," later changed to Persia, and did not adopt its current name until March 21, 1935. Its total area is 1,643,000 square kilometers, three times that of pre-war France, slightly larger than Xinjiang in our country. Most of it is dry highlands. Except for the east, there are mountains on the northwest and south sides. The southeastern desert stretches, occupying almost half of the entire territory. Only the northwestern territory can be considered fertile. Iran has a population of only 15 million, with Persians accounting for about two-thirds of the total.</p>
<p>Vast Oil Fields Give Rise to Disputes</p>
<p>Iran produces a lot of petroleum, which is essential for modern transportation. In Iran, petroleum is truly everywhere. Before the development of petroleum, the Iranian people collected petroleum everywhere for lighting and cooking. According to recent estimates, Iran produces 13 million tons of petroleum per year, ranking fourth in the world in terms of output.</p>
<p>As early as 1901, an Englishman named D'Arcy, who made a fortune in gold mines in Australia, came to Persia to explore and discovered large deposits of petroleum. On May 28 of that year, he signed a contract with King Mozaffar ad-Din Shah of Persia, leasing 500,000 square miles (four-fifths of the country) of petroleum rights for a price of US$20,000. In 1909, the Burma Oil Company purchased D'Arcy's petroleum exploration rights and organized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which was registered on April 14, 1909, and officially began exploration and sales. The capital of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was entirely British. Later, because Iran wanted to recover its oil rights, disputes arose between Britain and Iran. In 1933, with the mediation of the League of Nations, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement was revised on April 28 of that year, slightly improving Iran's rights. In 1937, the Iranian King signed another contract with the United States, granting the United States the oil exploration rights in eastern Iran.</p>
<p>After World War II, in November of last year, the Azerbaijanis in northern Iran rebelled against the Iranian government and demanded autonomy. On November 20, they established a National Assembly, and later established an autonomous government, declaring their secession from the rule of Tehran.</p>
<p>The Iranian government believed that the charade of autonomy was directed by the Soviet Union, so it filed a complaint with the Security Council. However, before the Security Council could formally discuss the matter, the new Prime Minister Sadr issued an order to withdraw the complaint, and the United Nations General Assembly also decided to hand over the Iranian issue to the Soviet Union and Iran for direct negotiations.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Withdraws, Problem Resolves Itself</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union and Iran were directly negotiating, Britain and the United States, seeing that the Soviet Union might gain control of the oil fields in northern Iran, successively sent notes to the Soviet Union, demanding an explanation for refusing to withdraw its troops from Iran. On March 13, American and British news agencies also said that the Soviet Union was greatly increasing its troops in Iran, advancing towards Tehran, the Iranian capital, on the one hand, and concentrating on the border between Iran, Turkey, and Iraq on the other, and that a war in the Middle East was about to break out. However, this rumor was immediately denied by TASS. However, the attitude of the United States was still very strong, expressing that it would fully support Iran in the Soviet-Iranian dispute.</p>
<p>When the Security Council had decided to open in New York on March 25, the Soviet-Iranian negotiations were in progress, and the Soviet troops in northern Iran had already made a partial withdrawal on March 2. Soviet Chief Representative Gromyko requested that the Security Council postpone the meeting from March 25 to April 10, but Truman insisted at a press conference on the 21st that the postponement was not possible. On March 23, Iranian Prime Minister Sadr suddenly broke his previous silence and said that the Soviet-Iranian issue might be resolved before the Security Council meeting, believing that the Security Council did not need to rush to discuss the Soviet-Iranian dispute. On March 24, Moscow Radio announced: Soviet troops had begun to withdraw from Iran on the 24th and could be completely withdrawn within five weeks. Stalin also declared that the Soviet-Iranian issue "has been completely resolved due to the agreement reached between the two governments." However, news came from the British side that Iran seemed to have agreed to the Soviet Union's demands, including Azerbaijan's autonomy, the Soviet Union's right to develop oil fields in northern Iran, and guarantees that Iran would be loyal to the Soviet Union in the future.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union took this action and withdrew its troops from Iran. The Soviet-Iranian dispute could theoretically be resolved through direct negotiations, but the United States insisted on including the Iranian issue on the agenda of the Security Council. On the 25th, the Security Council finally announced its opening in New York. After the meeting on the 26th, Soviet representative Gromyko requested that the Iranian issue not be included on the agenda, but was rejected by a vote of nine to two. After the adjournment, Gromyko proposed again that if the Iranian issue was included on the agenda, it should be postponed until April 10, but the United States insisted that the case should be accepted immediately and allowed the Iranian representative to make an oral statement. Therefore, Gromyko announced at the meeting on the 27th that he could not participate in the meeting, and the delegation withdrew from the venue at the same time.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States, in order to break the deadlock, agreed to postpone the discussion of the issue to April 3, and at the same time requested the Soviet Union and Iran to report to the Security Council on April 3: 1. What progress has been made in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran on the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal? 2. Is the Soviet troop withdrawal from Iran conditional on other concessions? Under these circumstances, the problem resolved itself, but with the Soviet Union and Britain simultaneously forcing the border, the problem came again.</p>

<h3>Traffic Improvement Measures Decided: Pedestrians to Walk on the Right, Congested Roads in the Central District Designated for One-Way Traffic, Five Parking Lots Designated, Traffic Signs Added, to be Implemented from September 1</h3>
<p>[Our News] The second traffic meeting convened by Mayor Wu was held at 3 pm yesterday in the City Hall conference room. Director of Public Utilities Zhao Cengyi, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Yu Shuping, and directors of various sub-bureaus such as Huangpu, Lao Zha, and Xin Cheng attended. The following important decisions regarding the city's traffic problems were made at yesterday's meeting:</p>
<h3>Ten Measures</h3>
<p>(1) The conference decided that the number of one-way traffic lines in the city should not be too many. The one-way traffic lines that have been decided are as follows: (A) North-South One-Way Traffic: (1) Sichuan Road for northbound traffic, (2) Henan Road for northbound traffic, (3) Jiangxi Road Bridge is abandoned and unused, and the north-south traffic is not continuous, so the traffic volume is reduced, and it can be changed to two-way traffic. (B) East-West One-Way Traffic: (1) Jiujiang Road for westbound traffic, (2) Hankou Road for eastbound traffic. (2) It was decided that the arrangement of various vehicles in the one-way traffic lines should be as follows: rickshaws must walk on the inner lane of the road, tricycles walk on the left side of the rickshaws, and motor vehicles walk on the left side of the tricycles. If cars want to overtake rickshaws, they must drive from the outer lane to maintain the fixed position of various vehicles. In addition, pedestrians walking on the sidewalks on both sides must also walk on the right. (3) Designated motor vehicle parking lots. These parking lots are rented from various groups or private individuals. In the future, vehicles must be concentrated in the parking lots to reduce congestion in the roads. The designated parking lots are as follows: (A) Zhongshan East 1st Road (i.e., the Bund) can park 200 to 300 vehicles, (B) Suzhou Road China Garden can park 200 vehicles, (C) Hankou Road Jiangxi Road intersection can park 70 vehicles, (D) Fuzhou Road Henan Road (the open space behind the current City Hall) can park 40 vehicles, (E) Henan Road Bridge can park 70 vehicles. The use of the above parking lots may be subject to reasonable fees. (4) The driving hours of heavy vehicles (tiger cars, dump trucks, etc.) are stipulated as follows: (A) In the central area main roads such as Nanjing Road, traffic is not allowed from 8 am to 12 noon and from 2 pm to 6 pm. (B) In other roads, traffic is prohibited from 8 am to 12 noon. The congestion situation in these roads has been investigated, and the afternoon is worse than the morning. (C) Military trucks not obeying the rules are one of the reasons for traffic congestion. It is now decided to ask the 33rd Gendarmerie Regiment, the US military headquarters, and the Garrison Command to assist in enforcing traffic discipline. (5) At each intersection along Nanjing Road, it was decided to delineate pedestrian lanes and parking lines to allow pedestrians to cross the road safely and to easily identify vehicles that violate the rules. The eight intersections decided to be delineated are: (1) Nanjing Road Xizang Road intersection, (2) Nanjing Road Zhejiang Road intersection, (3) Nanjing Road Fuzhou Road intersection, (4) Nanjing Road Tibet Road intersection, (5) Nanjing Road Henan Road intersection, (6) Nanjing Road Jiangxi Road intersection, (7) Nanjing Road Sichuan Road intersection, (8) Nanjing Road Zhongshan East 1st Road intersection. Separation lines will be added to the entrances and exits of one-way traffic lines. The ones decided are Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, etc. (6) Add traffic signs: add various traffic signs such as "no parking," "parking area," and "one-way traffic to the south or north" on the roads. (7) Add traffic lights: add traffic lights at important intersections, such as Sichuan Road Bridge, Tianhou Palace Bridge, Fujian Road, Sima Road intersection, Henan Road Bridge, etc. A total of 14 places need to be added. (8) Eliminate roadside vendors: Vendors are not allowed to set up stalls along the road outside the designated areas. The Police Bureau will strictly enforce this from today, and the penalty measures are as follows: the first offense is a fine of 5,000 yuan, the second offense is a fine of 10,000 yuan, and the third offense is confiscation. (9) The implementation method of the entire traffic plan: Each relevant bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the Huangpu and Lao Zha sub-bureaus will send two representatives. To speed up the process, each direct agency will be notified by telephone to execute the plan, without going through official documents. (10) All of the above resolutions will be implemented from September 1. However, there may be delays due to various material limitations.

<h3>Acceptance Work Investigation Team Announces: Investigation of the Case of Wang Zhuchen, Definite Evidence of Encroachment and Theft of Materials, Central Trust Bureau Suspected of Negligence</h3>
<p>According to the announcement of the Enemy and Puppet Property Acceptance Work Investigation Team of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, the investigation of the case of Wang Zhuchen, a Japanese merchant of No. 10 Beihai Ning Road, encroaching on and stealing enemy property from the Changdao Repair Factory, is as follows: The team received a confidential report on July 27, which stated that No. 10 Beihai Ning Road was originally the Japanese merchant Changdao Repair Factory. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was the largest automobile repair factory in Shanghai. There were many enemy properties left behind. When the victory came last year, the Shanghai Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government accepted the management of the enemy and Weili materials. In May of this year, when the Japanese merchant Changdao was about to return to his country, a Wang Zhuchen suddenly accepted it without authorization, rebranded it as the Xinyou Company Automobile Repair Factory, and gradually stole a large number of valuable materials inside by car. It has been secretly reported to the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District, but it has not been completely dealt with, so another secret report was made.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the country paid great attention and was studying thorough investigation methods. It also received the second and third secret reports, stating that Wang Zhuchen had been transporting about 30 to 40 tires, about 2,200 oil pump pipes, about 2,000 large and small cylinder beds, about 4,300 cracker blue rings, about 500 inner tires, and a truck of auto parts every day, and was still continuing to steal them, etc. The team considered the case to be serious. After discussion by various committees, it decided to investigate. Therefore, it first requested the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau to transfer the entire case file. After reviewing it, it was found that the bureau's handling of this case was only about a part of the fixed equipment of the factory, which had been transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for sealing. The enemy assets left inside were not investigated and dealt with at the same time. The handling of the case was inevitably negligent. Therefore, a letter was sent to the bureau for questioning at any time. Also, after reviewing the original file, the investigators reported on June 20. Why was it delayed until July 8 to inform Wang Zhuchen of the Songhu Garrison Command to exchange houses with Wu Tianxiang and seal them up? Why didn't they pay attention to and deal with other enemy relics at the same time? There was a suspicion of avoiding the important and taking the light. On July 19, Wu Tianxiang urged to remove the materials, but the request was delayed and ignored. It was not until August 6, when the team investigated, that the Central Trust Bureau was notified to send personnel to take over. The personnel responsible for handling this case were particularly negligent. Therefore, the bureau was requested to stop the leakage on the one hand and to trace the stolen enemy assets and the custody of the remaining enemy assets on the other hand. At the same time, committee members Zhang and Wu personally went to the Garrison Command to interview Commander Xuan to inquire about the case. Later, they sent a commissioner to work with the personnel in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Suzhou and Anhui District. After the Songhu Garrison Command investigated, Wang Zhuchen was not a staff member of the department. The department's files only concerned the house issue. Wang Zhuchen had requested the department to apply to the House Allocation Committee for the allocation of houses for repairing cars. The Garrison Command also sent inspectors disguised to investigate the situation of Wang Zhuchen leaking enemy assets. Based on the comprehensive investigation results from all aspects, it could be confirmed that Wang Zhuchen had encroached on and stolen enemy assets. Therefore, a letter was immediately sent to the Hongkou Sub-bureau requesting that Wang Zhuchen be detained first. The entire case file, along with the documents, was sent to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for legal investigation.</p>
<h3>Letter Sent to the Court for Legal Investigation</h3>
<p>Respectfully, according to repeated confidential reports, it was mentioned that after the Songhu Garrison Command accepted the Japanese merchant Changdao Repair Factory at No. 10 Beihai Ning Road last winter, Wang Zhuchen suddenly accepted the factory unconditionally in May of this year and used many degenerate Japanese Nazis to set up shareholders and expand the business after rebranding and continuously stealing a large number of valuable materials to prepare, and requested a thorough investigation. Based on this, after reading the content in detail, the case was serious. The Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District was ordered to transfer the case file. Committee members Zhang and Wu went to take over the remaining land property, and the commissioner was dispatched to go to the Garrison Command with the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau to read the files and handle them. If necessary, Wang Zhuchen can be detained first, all of which are on file. Based on the comprehensive investigation results and the handling of this case by the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau, Wang Zhuchen has a serious suspicion of encroaching on and stealing enemy assets. In order to prevent continued theft and thoroughly investigate the truth of the case, in addition to sending a letter to the Hongkou Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to detain Wang Zhuchen first, and sending letters to the Enemy and Puppet Property Treatment Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to investigate the relevant case files, and forwarding them to your court, the relevant documents of this case are enclosed with the letter. Please investigate and handle them in accordance with the law, and hope to be informed of the handling situation.</p>
<h3>An Interview with Mr. Abend: Talking About China's War, He Coughs Greatly</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] "When I first arrived in Shanghai, the doctors all said I wouldn't live long, at most only a month or two. But after coming here, and letting go of all my worries, I actually got better." Mr. Abend, leaning back in a chair by the window, with a "Pocket Book," specially printed for the American military, spread open on his lap, said this with a smile.</p>
<p>Mr. Abend indeed looked much better. His silvery white hair was neatly combed, his complexion was rosy, and his spirits were quite good. Although he still coughed often when speaking, and his right hand still frequently rested on his left chest, his "coughing fits" had lessened considerably compared to the several times I had visited him in the past month or two.</p>
<p>He said with a smile, "Didn't you say in the newspaper that I came to Shanghai to see 'one last glimpse'? I didn't expect that when you came to see me this time, I would still be doing so well." I said that probably doctors' words, from ancient times to the present, shouldn't be taken too seriously, otherwise George Bernard Shaw wouldn't constantly joke with doctors in his plays.</p>
<p>Mr. Abend suddenly scrutinized me for a moment and slowly said, "Do you really think so?"</p>
<p>The air was a bit heavy, so we talked about politics.</p>
<p>When it was mentioned that some people advocated inviting Britain to join in mediating the China problem, he seemed somewhat incredulous, repeatedly asking which news agency had reported the news. I said, regardless of the accuracy of the news, if Britain were actually invited, would he think Britain would participate? I said, "Mr. Abend is an observer who deeply understands the situation in China, surely he has some opinions."</p>
<p>He said, "What can I observe in a sickroom? However, Britain is probably busy enough with a Turkish problem and a Palestinian problem, isn't it?"</p>
<p>As soon as we touched on the current state of affairs in China, with war clouds looming, Mr. Abend began to cough greatly!</p>
<p>The air was filled with coughing sounds. I thought it would be better to do something else—so I asked him to take a photo.</p>
<p>I knew that Mr. Abend was not very willing to have his picture taken, but yesterday he actually made an exception and agreed. Even the nurse was surprised and said incredulously, "He agreed to have his picture taken today?"</p>
<p>Mr. Abend is an extremely resolute person. Without resolution, he wouldn't have come to China in such a seriously ill state. "Resolution" can create miracles in medicine, and I hope that this miracle will eventually overcome his terminal illness! (The photo is a recent portrait of Mr. Abend, taken by our newspaper)</p>
<h3>The Disposal Bureau Transfers Seized Properties for Review by the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Enemy and Puppet Property Seizure Work Investigation Team has received over a hundred confidential reports since starting work in Shanghai, and they are currently processing them separately. A list of properties seized by the Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Region Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has been compiled and sent to the team for review. Furthermore, Commissioners Wu Wang and Zhang Qingzhen are scheduled to personally inquire about the 1,156 warehouses seized in the city within the week, including the nature of the warehouses, the types of goods stored, the reasons for not opening them, and studying which organizations they should be returned to. All of these are within the scope of the investigation. It was rumored that the team would stop accepting confidential reports on the 24th of this month. However, Commissioner Zhang stated that this was purely a rumor, and the team will continue to accept confidential reports even after moving to Hangzhou and other places.</p>
<h3>German Nationals' Leftover Properties Transferred to the Disposal Bureau for Clearance</h3>
<p>After German nationals in the city were concentrated for residence, and a portion of them were sent back to their country last month, all matters handled by the German Nationals Management Committee regarding properties left by German nationals have been separately transferred to the German Nationals Property Clearance Office of the Soochow-Chekiang-Anhwei Region Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau for specialized handling.</p>
<h3>More Suspects Arrested in the Counterfeit US Dollar Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter learned from the US military that after the US military, together with the Garrison Headquarters, arrested five suspects in the counterfeit US dollar manufacturing case, three more people were arrested that night. Five of them are White Russians. It is also learned that two more suspects in the case have been arrested by the authorities, and the case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Checks Written with Ballpoint Pens Not Honored</h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial community is paying close attention to the validity of checks written with ballpoint pens. They entrusted the Bankers Association to conduct a study, and the study concluded that according to banking regulations, checks must be written with a Chinese brush or an ink pen. Pencils cannot be used to write checks. Because the color of ballpoint pens is similar to that of carbon pencils, they should be treated as pencils, and checks written with them cannot be cashed. Furthermore, signatures on signature cards cannot be made with ballpoint pens when opening an account. The Shanghai Silver and Money Industries Association, concerned about business matters and to prevent check fraud, sent a circular to its members yesterday to standardize procedures.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Prevent Petty Criminal Activity; Security Strengthened at US Military Barracks</h3>
<p>According to sources, a large number of Communist troops are currently infiltrating the Kiangnan area, attempting to take the opportunity to damage telecommunications, transportation, and utilities in various places, in order to disturb the people's hearts and endanger local security. After receiving this information, the city authorities immediately ordered the city's major utilities companies to take strict precautions. After receiving the instructions, each company has added defensive works at key locations and dispatched employees to patrol day and night to prevent unforeseen events. After receiving reports that Communist troops were attempting to damage the telecommunications network, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications specially requested that the garrisons along the Kiangsu-Chekiang-Anhwei routes provide substantial protection for the wires along the roads. Military units have also been dispatched by local garrison troops to protect telecommunications bureaus in various places. Considering the increasingly serious current situation, local authorities and central government agencies in Shanghai fear that petty criminals may take the opportunity to infiltrate and disrupt offices. Therefore, from yesterday onward, the entrances and exits of all agencies are strictly controlled, and the identities of those entering and exiting are carefully checked.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To avoid accidents, the US military stationed in Shanghai was ordered yesterday to refrain from going out after 7:00 PM. At the same time, sentries were posted at all entrances and exits of the barracks, and security was strengthened.</p>

<h3>White Russian Impersonates Authority, Special Agent Extorts Money</h3>
<p>Several cases were heard on the same day: (1) White Russian Panlin Alexander published articles in the Pylos magazine in the fall of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) when the enemy attacked Shanghai, advocating for the enemy and opposing our war policy. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), he served as an employee of the intelligence bureau of the enemy's consulate in Shanghai. Kedinovich joined the enemy's secret intelligence agency and collected military goods and transported hardware and other materials to Annam for the enemy. Tetyesky was also an informant for the enemy's military police. The High Procuratorate jointly prosecuted the above three persons. Among them, Tetyesky is in custody, and the other two are out on bail. During yesterday's hearing, Panlin Alexander did not appear, and both Tetyesky and Kedinovich denied the charges. (2) Hu Chongmin, the chief of the seventh action team of the special high section of the judicial division of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, his deputy, Japanese national Takahashi Toshikio, informants Hu Jia, and detectives Ye Heshang, Sun Junbao, Zhang Kexun, Liu Qipei, and Li Yongkang, arrested Wang Ren in August of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) for demanding remittances without success, accusing him of being a member of Chongqing and torturing him. After the victory, Wang Ren filed a complaint with President Chiang, who transferred the case to the High Court for trial. Takahashi Toshikio was a war criminal and was handed over to the relevant authorities. Zhang Kexun is in custody, and Li Yongkang is out on bail. The rest are at large.

The accuser testified about the process, and the defendant denied it. (4) Enemy secret agent Wang Qiugen. All of the above cases were postponed for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Jeep Overturns While Joyriding, Sixteen Children Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 4:30 PM yesterday, a tragic incident occurred on the Guangfu Road bridge in western Shanghai when a jeep overturned, injuring as many as sixteen people on the spot. Qu Binsen, a driver from the 14th Division of the New Sixth Army, drove jeep number 16158 to Tanjia Du, north of Caojiadu in western Shanghai, yesterday afternoon to visit a friend. His friend, Luo Jinsong, a 21-year-old Shanghai native who is currently a coppersmith for UNRRA, borrowed the car for a joyride, carrying fifteen children from the neighborhood who were out for evening coolness, most of whom were children of Xinsha Factory workers. When the car reached the Xiguangfu Road bridge and attempted to turn onto Fuxing Road, it swerved too quickly to avoid an oncoming vehicle, causing it to overturn. Luo and fifteen children in the car were thrown out of the car, all of them were injured and bleeding profusely. The police on duty urgently summoned an ambulance and sent the injured and the car to the Tongren Second Hospital on Yidingpan Road for treatment. Eleven of them suffered minor injuries and were discharged after bandaging. The remaining five suffered serious injuries. Because the hospital had no spare beds, it only admitted two patients, Li Axing, 14 years old, and Wang Xindong, 10 years old. The other three were transferred to the Red Cross Hospital, namely Chen Kuanyu, 16 years old, Luo Chungen, 20 years old, and Mu Daoming, 16 years old. The culprit, Luo Jinsong, suffered minor injuries and is currently being interrogated by the Putuo Road Police Station.</p>

<p>Estimated to Set Sail Today</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's North Sea ship, originally scheduled to depart for Qingdao and Tianjin at noon on the 14th, was delayed due to passengers boarding the ship without permission, causing a dispute and preventing it from leaving the port on time. Yesterday, the manager of the company returned to customs to apply, and the customs authorities dispatched officers from the port police station at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday to persuade them to leave the ship. Fang and a dozen police officers went to the North Sea ship to persuade them to disembark. It was learned that some passengers had purchased tickets from the ticket offices in advance. The company and customs authorities summoned the ticket office representatives to inquire and ordered them to refund the tickets. At approximately 5:00 PM, several ticket offices brought money on board, redeemed the tickets, and the passengers disembarked one by one. Some passengers had already purchased berths on the ship and had to be refunded the berth fees before leaving, which caused some minor issues. Generally speaking, all passengers had disembarked by last night, and it is estimated that the ship can set sail today.</p>
<h3>Relieving Unemployed Workers: Work-for-Relief Planned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Unemployed Workers Temporary Relief Committee has been established for ten months. Recently, the Executive Headquarters urgently needed to transport flour to the interior to relieve disaster victims, so the flour relief for unemployed workers could not be allocated in full. Therefore, the committee decided to close at the end of this month and transfer unfinished matters to other relevant agencies for continued handling. It is also learned that there are still more than 60,000 unemployed workers in the city. Recently, due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce, the number of unemployed workers has increased. The authorities are planning to organize joint factories and formulate a work-for-relief plan to provide active relief.</p>
<h3>Dahua Airlines to Choose Auspicious Day for Opening After Trading</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Dahua Airlines is an organization formed by private capital and has been preparing for a long time, but has not yet obtained a business license. According to insiders, China's aviation industry is still in the developing stage, and it has not been clearly determined whether it will be state-owned or privately operated. This is probably the reason why the company has been unable to obtain a license for so long. Dahua currently has five passenger planes. It has recently been approved by the Ministry of Communications to temporarily use the license and brand of Central Airlines to operate flights, with three planes regularly flying on the Shanghai-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Chongqing routes. Once the license is obtained, it will separate from Central Airlines immediately. It is said that the company is actively requesting a license from the authorities.</p>

<h3>Verdict on Gold Bar Theft Case: Chen Yuansheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Wu Minggang, Chen Youqing, et al. Receive Prison Terms; Stolen Gold Bar and Legal Tender to Be Fully Recovered According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank gold bar theft case, previously concluded through a preliminary hearing, was pronounced by Judge Zhong Xianda of the Second Criminal Tribunal at 12:00 noon yesterday. Main text: Chen Yuansheng is sentenced to life imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of public property, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights. Wu Minggang is sentenced to seven months imprisonment for harboring stolen goods, Chen Youqing is sentenced to nine months imprisonment for knowingly purchasing stolen goods, Shi Xianglong is sentenced to five months imprisonment for receiving stolen goods, Yu Shiyang is sentenced to three months imprisonment for harboring stolen goods, and Wang Shumei is found not guilty. One gold bar weighing over 453 taels and a check for 5,358,493.80 legal tender yuan shall be recovered.</p>
<p>The main culprit, Chen Yuansheng, wore a checkered short-sleeved shirt and trousers with a shaved head and black shoes yesterday. Upon hearing the verdict, he lowered his head and remained silent, and was escorted back to prison by bailiffs. Among the other defendants who were out on bail, only Yu Shiyang was present in court.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Judgment</p>
<p>The full text states: "The defendant Chen Yuansheng has already confessed to the facts of the crime during the interrogation. This confession is consistent with the statements made by Pan Jia, Yu Shiyang, and others, which is sufficient to prove the facts. The defendant should be punished according to law. However, considering that the motives for embezzling public property were based on financial difficulties and were carried out continuously, although there are several acts, they should still be considered as one continuous crime. The defendant was living with his brother, so he should have had no worries and should have been content and self-sufficient, without resorting to wrongdoing. However, he was addicted to gambling and pleasure-seeking, and his monthly salary was not enough, so he spent lavishly and suffered from failed speculation, which led him to steal and sell public property. Although this may be considered a desperate situation, it was self-inflicted. The defendant fled to Hangzhou and continued to indulge in pleasure and spend recklessly, which shows his true character. Furthermore, the defendant was unwilling to accept poverty and first attempted to make a fortune through speculation, and then continuously stole property under his custody in his official capacity. Considering the circumstances, the crime is unforgivable and a severe penalty should be imposed as a warning. As for the defendant's claim that he was only an employee of the Central Bank, since the defendant was a person engaged in public service according to laws and regulations, there is no need to debate whether he is a public official. The defendant embezzled public property in his capacity as a public official, so he should be charged with corruption. Furthermore, the stolen gold bar and the check for 5,358,493.80 yuan should be recovered from the defendants according to law."</p>
<p>Wu Minggang's Part in Harboring Stolen Goods</p>
<p>During the interrogation, the defendant Wu Minggang did not deny receiving a gold bar stolen from the Central Bank by Chen Yuansheng. However, he argued that the deal was arranged by Pan Jia by phone, and then Yang Desheng, deputy section chief of the Shanghai City Bank's business department, and Wang Shuhai, manager of the Xinda Bank, jointly delivered it. Therefore, he did not suspect it was stolen goods. However, the Ministry of Finance had already explicitly prohibited the use of funds as collateral, and the Ministry of Finance had issued a statement to this effect in the Dagong Bao in April. The defendant knew that banks were not allowed to use gold as collateral, but he rashly did so, which was wrong. Moreover, the gold bar was engraved with the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria," so it was obvious that it was a thing received from the enemy and puppet regime. Such materials could not be possessed or traded by ordinary people. However, the defendant was greedy for profit and recklessly took the risk, which is unforgivable. Although he claimed that he did not open the paper package and inspect it at the time, the mortgage of a gold bar is not like an ordinary mortgage. The defendant did not even inspect the collateral worth over 60 million yuan before rashly accepting it, which is unbelievable. It was found that the defendant was acquainted with Pan Jia, but had no contact with Wang Shumei and others. Therefore, he must have opened the gold bar delivered by them to verify its authenticity. This is consistent with general trading practices. Although the defendant repeatedly denied knowing that he was receiving stolen goods, based on the above analysis, his claim is not credible. It is clear that the defendant is a businessman who was greedy for a small profit and thus fell into the trap of the law. Considering the circumstances, he deserves to be punished leniently as a minor warning.</p>
<p>Chen Youqing's Part in Knowingly Purchasing Stolen Goods</p>
<p>It was found that the defendant Chen Youqing admitted to buying a gold bar stolen from the Central Bank by Chen Yuansheng through Pan Jia and others on May 4th of this year. Although he claimed that he did not knowingly purchase stolen goods, the gold bar was engraved with the English words "Central Bank of Manchuria," so it was obvious that it was a thing received from the puppet organization, which could not be possessed or traded by ordinary people. The defendant falsely claimed that he did not examine the gold bar in detail at the time to defend himself against the charge of knowingly purchasing stolen goods. However, the purchase of a gold bar worth over 70 million yuan is not a trivial matter. He must have carefully examined it and distinguished its authenticity before making the transaction. The defendant knew that the seller could not possess the gold bar, but he still bought it, which is obviously unforgivable. The fact that the defendant delivered it to Shi Xianglong for melting after buying it further proves that the defendant knew that the gold bar was stolen. Because there are many money shops and banks in Shanghai that could buy gold bars. If the defendant needed money urgently, he could have resold it to someone else. There was no need to deliver it to Shi Xianglong for melting on the same day. Considering the circumstances, the defendant wanted to destroy the evidence of his crime of knowingly purchasing stolen goods, which is enough to convict him and should be punished according to law as a warning.</p>
<p>Shi Xianglong's Part in Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The defendant Shi Xianglong admitted to receiving the gold bar delivered by Chen Youqing on May 4th of this year and melting it immediately, obtaining over 70,000 yuan for melting it. However, he argued that he did not know the gold bar was stolen because he did not understand English. However, Shanghai is a hub for domestic and foreign trade, and even apprentices in small shops can speak fluent English. It is not credible that the defendant, as a manager, claims not to know English. Furthermore, he claimed that he was only 35 years old and was educated in a private school and did not receive modern education, so he does not understand English, which is also unbelievable. Since the gold bar is not something that ordinary people can possess, and it is engraved with the words "Central Bank of Manchuria," it is obvious that it is a thing received from the puppet organization. However, the defendant was greedy for the melting fee and recklessly received it for melting, so he should be held responsible for receiving stolen goods without any doubt.</p>
<p>Yu Shiyang's Part in Harboring Stolen Goods</p>
<p>It was found that the defendant Yu Shiyang harbored four packages of Class C national unified bonds with a face value of 960,000 yuan for Chen Yuansheng on May 18th of this year. These bonds were recovered by the Central Bank after the incident. He admitted to these facts, but claimed that he did not know the bonds were stolen. However, the defendant was not a stranger to Chen Yuansheng and knew his financial situation. Chen Yuansheng was only an assistant employee of the Central Bank, so it is obvious that he would not have such a huge amount of bonds. Moreover, the four packages of bonds were sealed with the seals of the Central Bank and Chen Yuansheng, which clearly showed that they were not Chen Yuansheng's personal property. The defendant knew that these bonds were stored in the Central Bank's warehouse, but he still harbored them, so he should be held responsible for his crime without any doubt. Considering that he was limited by friendship, he committed a crime. Considering the circumstances, he deserves to be punished leniently as a minor warning.</p>
<p>Wang Shumei's Part in Transporting Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that the defendant Wang Shumei is suspected of transporting stolen goods because she acted on behalf of Pan Jia on April 24th of this year and signed a loan contract with Wu Minggang, the manager of the Chongqing Bank's Shanghai branch, and carried the gold bar together with Yang Desheng to deliver it. Therefore, she had the intention of transporting stolen goods. However, the defendant stated that she was invited by Pan to sign the contract on behalf of him. Because a friend said that gold could be used as collateral, and the Chongqing Bank could not provide a mortgage in a private name according to the precedent, she used the Xinda Bank opened by the defendant as the mortgagor, and did not know that the gold bar was stolen. The defendant's statements are consistent with Pan Jia's statements and are credible. Pan's invitation to the defendant to act as the mortgagor did not mention the source of the gold bar to the defendant. His intention was to use the defendant's Xinda Bank as the mortgagor. The defendant did not open the gold bar during the transport, and Yang Desheng also confirmed that he accompanied her. Although the defendant should not have been so careless, since she did not know it was stolen goods, her carrying the gold bar to the Qing Bank for delivery should not be considered a crime of transporting stolen goods. In addition, there is no other definite evidence to prove that the defendant committed a crime. According to the legal principle that the purpose of convicting a crime is to discover the truth, it is not appropriate to convict her.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Litigation Regulations, Articles 3, paragraph 2 and 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, Article 349, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and Article 293, paragraph 1 of the same Code of Criminal Procedure, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Simplified Normal Schools Enrolling New Students; Age Should Be Limited</h3>
<p>Should Be Young People Who Are Fully 15 Years of Age</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Education believes that simplified normal schools were originally set up temporarily to promote national education and increase the number of teachers. They should enroll young people who have graduated from elementary school and are at least 15 years old, and after three or four years of training, they should be assigned to serve in national schools in various districts. Age should be limited in advance. If education departments or bureaus in various provinces and cities, or national normal schools running simplified normal schools, feel that enrollment is difficult, they can enroll junior high school graduates to run a one-year simplified normal school program. In addition, regarding the various border normal schools, when enrolling new border teachers this summer, the age requirement should be strictly enforced, and young people under the age of 15 should not be enrolled.</p>
<h3>Zhao Naichuan Discusses the Recent Situation of the Peking University Law School</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Zhao Naichuan, acting dean of the Peking University Law School, recently told reporters about the recent situation of the school: The school is divided into three departments: Law, Politics, and Economics. The Sociology Department belongs to the College of Liberal Arts. This department is like the Psychology Department, which is sometimes included in the College of Liberal Arts and sometimes in the Law School. Yan Shutang is the chairman of the Law Department, Qian Duansheng is the chairman of the Political Science Department, and Zhao Naichuan also serves as the chairman of the Economics Department. The faculty of the three departments is strong. The Economics Department alone has ten experts, eight of whom have been confirmed: financial economist Qin Zan, monetary and banking expert Zhou Zuoren, statistician Yang Ximeng, economic history expert Zhou Binglin, economic theory expert Zhao Naichuan, and accountant Song Zuonan. The Law Department has ten professors and the Political Science Department has seven. In terms of students, there are about 250 students in the Political Science Department, 200 in the Law Department, and over 400 in the Economics Department. With the addition of new students, the Law School will have nearly 1,000 students. The Peking University Red Building will now be divided between the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law. Zhao continued: The Law School focuses on academic research. Although there is a Political Science Department, political activities are not allowed during study. Students will be asked to do more reading reports to build an academic foundation. Regarding the Law Department, Zhao specifically pointed out that it is not enough to increase the number of years of graduation in order to achieve gains in legal theory. It requires at least six years. Therefore, he advocates the establishment of an independent law school. In this way, political science and economics will become a college of political economy, which is in line with the opinions of the recent Higher Education Conference held in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Uniform Fee Collection Method for Provincial Middle Schools in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Taipei News] The Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, in view of the fact that the types and amounts of fees collected by provincial middle schools and vocational schools in Taiwan Province are inconsistent, which inevitably increases the burden on students, in order to achieve uniformity, has specially ordered regulations for the fees collected, starting from the first semester of the 35th academic year.

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>Household Affairs Personnel in Each District Must Not Be Transferred Easily - Municipal Government Issues Order to All District Offices for Compliance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government issued an order to all district offices yesterday, stating that household affairs are not only complicated but also require special skills. Therefore, the personnel in charge must have perseverance and rich experience. The directors of the household affairs sections in each district are the actual responsible personnel for household affairs in the entire district and should be carefully selected. However, in the past, each district often transferred household affairs personnel easily due to the change of district chiefs, which affected the efficiency of household affairs. Furthermore, the replacement of household affairs personnel often required them to report to work in advance, hoping to create a fait accompli so that the superior authorities had to recognize it, which was even more inappropriate and should be strictly corrected. Three measures are hereby formulated as follows: (1) In the future, household affairs personnel in each district who work hard and achieve outstanding results shall be protected and shall not be dismissed directly due to changes in district chiefs. (2) When each district replaces household affairs personnel, it shall select those with household affairs experience and report to the Municipal Government for approval, and shall go to the competent department of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government in advance to wait for inquiries. (3) In the second-class district offices, the directors of the household affairs sections are concurrently held by the chief secretary, and some are concurrently held by the director of the civil affairs section. It is found that the chief secretary and the director of the civil affairs section have very heavy official duties and cannot take care of them at the same time. In the future, the director of the household affairs section should be a full-time position. The affairs of the culture or economy section are simpler and can be held concurrently, so as to be reasonable and not affect the establishment. In addition to separate orders, the above three points are hereby ordered to be strictly complied with by the district.</p>
<h3>The Director of the Household Affairs Section in the First District Performs Poorly - Municipal Government Specifically Censures</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently investigated that the household registration statistical tables and the statistical tables for filling out national identity cards for June in the first, fifth, tenth, eleventh, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, and thirty-first districts were overdue for one month and have not yet been filled out and reported, which clearly shows that the directors of the household affairs sections in the districts are not working hard, and they are specifically censured. The district offices are also limited to send the above statistics within three days.</p>
<h3>Nineteenth District Examines the Work of Bao Secretaries</h3>
<p>The forty-one full-time Bao secretaries in the Nineteenth District, who were previously qualified by the Municipal Government examination, have been employed for nearly half a year. The district office usually holds a work review meeting for Bao secretaries every Saturday afternoon. In order to understand the performance of each Bao secretary, the district office sent Chief Secretary Meng and Director Zhao of the Civil Affairs Section to each Bao to inspect and assess their work. Meng gave detailed guidance on promoting local autonomy and enriching the equipment of the Bao office.</p>
<p>In addition, the district office held a symposium for Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs at the Hudong Grand Theater at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 600 Bao chiefs, Jia chiefs, and Bao secretaries attended the meeting. District Chief Tian was absent due to other important official duties, and Deputy District Chief Meng Xinmin presided over the meeting, reporting on major cases such as promoting national education, eliminating illiteracy, and the police branch's handling of the vocational census. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Fourth District Rechecks Household Registration</h3>
<p>The Fourth District (Penglai) District Office in this city, because the people's houses destroyed in the district during the occupation have now been rebuilt one after another, resulting in frequent changes in household registration and a sharp increase in immigration. In order to facilitate the transcription of household registration, the recheck of household registration began last month. Except for the 16th Bao and 52nd Bao, which were returned for correction, the rechecks of other Bao have been completed, and all the forms have been reported to the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government yesterday.</p>
<h3>Citizens of the Fourteenth District Petition to Open Hongxing Road</h3>
<p>Wang Gongyu and other citizens of the Fourteenth District (Zhabei) in this city yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the opening of Hongxing Road in Zhabei, removing the accumulated materials from the road, restoring the original road before the war, and facilitating traffic.</p>
<h3>Cai Guodong Resigns Concurrently</h3>
<p>Cai Guodong, a representative of the district residents in the Twelfth District of this city, resigned his concurrent position on the grounds that he was elected as a member of the first Municipal Council and could not hold the position of representative of the district residents concurrently according to law. The district office has reported the request to the Municipal Government yesterday, and intends to replace the vacant position of representative of the district residents with the alternate candidate Liu Fupei.</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(7) Question: The age of the people in the registration book changes year by year. Can the example of changing occupation and education level be used to attach a signature?</p>
<p>Answer: The registration book has a registration date to be verified, which is convenient for calculation, and there is no need to attach a signature.</p>
<p>(8) Question: Which application form should be used for the change of registration of the head of the household and family members, the household registration application form or the personal registration application form?</p>
<p>Answer: Use the household registration application form.</p>
<p>(9) Question: The age column of the personal registration application form is too small. Can only the year be filled in without filling in the month?</p>
<p>Answer: Only fill in the full year in the age column without filling in the zero month. If it is less than one year old, draw "〇" in the age column.</p>
<p>(10) Question: Where should the application for marriage registration be made?</p>
<p>Answer: The application should be made to the household registration director of the current residence at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>(11) Question: When a household wants to transfer its original place of residence to another county or city, should it only apply for transfer registration or should it apply for registration separately?</p>
<p>Answer: When applying for transfer registration, whether it is removal or registration, both are transfer registration applications.</p>
<p>(12) Question: Article 103, Paragraph 1 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that when accepting a transfer registration application, the household registration director shall send a copy of the new household registration to the supervising agency. Article 16 of the Implementation Rules stipulates that the county and city governments shall review and verify the copy and re-enter it into the registration book. The two regulations are different. Is it still necessary for the township offices to send a copy of the new household registration?</p>
<p>Answer: Please handle it according to Article 16 of the revised Household Registration Law Implementation Rules, and no additional copy will be made.</p>
<p>(13) Question: Does the person referred to in Article 93, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law, mean the person who is temporarily dispatched to send the application form, or the person who has the responsibility and obligation to send it?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called person who sends it refers to the person who has the responsibility and obligation to send it. For example, in accordance with the regulations for abandoned children, the discoverer or the police station that receives the discoverer's report shall apply for birth registration within 24 hours. The sending refers to the discoverer or the police station that receives the discoverer's report, not the messenger temporarily dispatched by the discoverer to send the application form, or the police station that receives the discoverer's report, to send the application form.</p>

<h3>Wartime Savings Paid Back at a Thousand Times, Public Bonds Black Market Creates Another Storm, Unified Internal Bonds Highest Rise to 1,700</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Public bonds suddenly rose yesterday. The matter of deposits in the Four Banks Savings Association has been brewing for a long time. Now that the court has ruled that it should be returned at a thousand times, it has attracted attention from all parties. After being stirred up by major players in the industry, outside speculative funds have been attracted again, and buying momentum has suddenly become strong. Unified Class C bonds started at 900 yuan, with demand exceeding supply, and suddenly rose to 1,700 yuan. Many bulls in the industry took profits and saw a callback after the high, but because retail investors maintained it from time to time, there was a major struggle in the middle. Finally, due to illusory prospects, it fell back to around 1,200 yuan and then stabilized. As a result, it rose sharply by 500 yuan compared with the previous closing. Class A and B bonds rose by 290 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 410 yuan, and Class E bonds also rose by 480 yuan. It is necessary to pay special attention to whether the government's issuance of public bonds and the bank's absorption of deposits can be discussed together. The entire process of the recent court judgment in the case of Chen Jilin suing the Four Banks Savings Association is recorded below:</p>
<p>Loss of Savings After Currency Inflation</p>
<p>During the war, the value of the currency fell frequently. Generally, the time deposit account holders of banks could not use their deposits due to the time limit. When the principal and interest were settled at maturity, the absolute amount of legal tender obtained was higher than when the deposit was made. However, the internal purchasing power of the deposit was only one-thousandth of the time when the deposit was made. Should the bank give the time deposit account holder a silver compensation for the depreciation of the currency value, or should it still pay the original principal and interest? This issue has long been the focus of discussion among the general public. Recently, this issue has aroused more attention in the financial community because a court case has occurred in this city.</p>
<p>Chen Jilin Sues the Four Banks Savings Association</p>
<p>Chen Jilin deposited 2,000 yuan of legal tender in the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, as a long-term savings deposit for five years. The deposit matured on May 6, 1945, and the principal and interest have not yet been settled. Chen believes that during this six-year period, drastic changes have taken place in the social economy, and the cost of living index has increased by about 4,000 times. If it is still paid according to the original amount, it is obviously unfair. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the court, believing that according to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan Zi No. 3018, the defendant should be responsible for increasing the payment, and requested that the defendant increase the payment of the plaintiff's 2,000 yuan deposit and its interest by 3,000 times.</p>
<p>Court Orders Payment at a Thousand Times</p>
<p>Main text of the court judgment: The defendant shall increase the payment of the plaintiff's long-term savings deposit of 2,000 yuan of legal tender and its interest by 1,000 times. The main points of the court's reasoning for this case are: The plaintiff made a long-term savings deposit for an agreed five years, and the principal and interest were not settled after maturity. During this long war period, the economic situation changed drastically. It was neither the responsibility of the plaintiff nor could it be foreseen by the plaintiff at the time. Based on the regulations cited by the defendant and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, it is credible that the defendant should be responsible for increasing the payment. However, after the defendant received the savings deposit, it did take part of the deposit as working capital, and the remaining deposits were either used to purchase public bonds and other bonds as collateral, or invested in real estate to stabilize it. After that, the income was used for various activities and utilization. Although the public bonds suffered considerable losses due to the Ministry of Finance's method of repaying the principal at par value, the amount of currency in other investments has greatly increased. It is necessary to make an additional payment of 1,000 times to maintain fairness.</p>
<p>Regulations on Increasing or Decreasing Payment Should Also Apply to Banks</p>
<p>The court also believes that the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan Zi No. 3018 and Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation are generally applicable regulations for increasing or decreasing payments. Since there is no explicit provision for excluding banks, it should be applied. Moreover, the measures of the Ministry of Finance submitted by the defendant are the measures for converting and paying counterfeit savings certificates and legal tender, and there is no provision prohibiting banks from increasing payments. Even if the Ministry of Finance has measures that conflict with the regulations, there is no room for applying them in the judicial arena. Banks can obtain huge profits by using the funds of depositors. Depositors watch the value depreciate due to long-term freezing. If it is not increased according to the regulations, how can it be considered fair? Based on the above legal arguments, the plaintiff's claim in this case is partly justified and partly unjustified, and should be approved and dismissed separately. The judgment is made in accordance with Article 79 of the Civil Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Financial Community Believes the Impact is Too Serious</p>
<p>The reporter asked the financial community for their opinions on this matter. They believe that this issue affects the general financial community and is very serious in nature. The government has not yet established a method for how banks should repay pre-war time deposits. Now the court has ruled that time deposits should be paid 1,000 times more, which has made the banks at a loss as to what to do. They believe that the bank's loans and deposit reserve funds have not increased by multiples compared with before the war. The Ministry of Finance has paid the original value of pre-war public bonds. The Central Savings Association's clearing of old savings deposits is also calculated at the old value. Therefore, they expressed that they could not accept the court's ruling.</p>
<h3>Two Important Reference Articles in the Judgment</h3>
<p>(1) Main Points of Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3018</p>
<p>Depositing money in a bank is for the purpose of preserving the value of money. The nature of the contract is a consumption deposit. The so-called preservation of the value of money refers to the legal value of preserving money. If silver coins or legal tender are deposited, the bank shall return the same amount of legal tender. Even if the economic value of the legal tender is low, it cannot be said that the obligation to preserve has been violated. However, if the law has special provisions on the scope of its repayment obligation, it shall not be excluded from its application because it has not violated the obligation to preserve. Consumption deposits shall be subject to the provisions on consumption loans in accordance with Article 602 of the Civil Law. Since Article 11 and Article 20, Paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation in Extraordinary Times have special provisions on the scope of the repayment obligation for consumption loans, they cannot be excluded from their application in the event of requesting repayment of deposits. Bank loans are essentially consumption loans, and the event of requesting repayment of loans can also be handled according to this special provision. The interpretation of Yuan Jie Zi No. 2885 should not be changed.</p>
<p>(2) Original Text of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Repatriation</p>
<p>If, after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to a normal person, the circumstances change and are unforeseeable at the time, and it is clearly unfair to base it on its original effect, the court shall fairly determine and render a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects.</p>
<h3>Firm Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold certificates continued to weaken. There was a lack of momentum for an increase. The opening price in the morning was around 1.95 million, and the high price once rebounded to 1.956 million. However, soon there was a flow of selling, and buyers remained on the sidelines. Prices gradually declined slightly. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 6 or 7 units, and the price dropped to 1.94 million. After that, morale was low. Money exchange businesses also engaged in cutthroat selling. At noon, the price fell back to 1.935 million, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized somewhat. US dollars provided considerable support, and there was a slight rebound. However, the final price was still 2,000 lower than the previous closing. Gold ornaments and silver bullion remained unchanged. Silver dollars declined slightly. The unofficial interest rate on silver was rampant, with rates ranging from 9 fen to 1 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies continued to weaken. US dollars opened in the morning at 2,560 yuan for sale. After opening, the trend gradually shifted from stable to loose. The gold market declined, lacking support. At noon, it fell below 2,540 yuan. In the afternoon, there were some buyers stockpiling for future use, and a slight rebound was reported. The final price was up slightly by 5 yuan from the previous closing. Hong Kong banknotes were stable with multiple transactions, with asking prices ranging from a mid-level of 668 yuan down to 660 yuan. In the end, it still stood around 665 yuan, resulting in a slight decrease of 1 yuan from the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate, due to Shanghai telegrams, rose to 181.5 yuan. Yesterday, it was sold at 552 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 663 yuan. The British exchange rate had offers at 8,840 yuan. The US exchange rate remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>100,000 Bags of Flour Produced, Actual Sales Only 30,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Association Again Requests Permission to Export</p>
<p>Currently, there is a surplus of flour production in this city. The Fourth District Flour Industry Association had previously requested the Ministry of Food to transport and sell flour to other locations or for the Ministry of Food to purchase it. The Ministry of Food replied that it was acting on President Song's telegraphic order, which prohibited reporting for transit. Furthermore, the food situation in Shanghai had not yet emerged from emergency times, and the transit of flour should still be prohibited. As for the prohibition of wheat transit, there was currently no need. The Flour Industry Association believed that if this policy was not changed, the current wheat loan would inevitably suffer losses, and the wheat loan would become a major problem. Therefore, it earnestly requested the Four Joint Offices to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to prohibit wheat transit in the shortest possible time or lift the flour ban. According to people in the flour industry, if raw wheat could be exported, prices would inevitably rise. If the transport of flour to other locations was prohibited, sales would stagnate, and prices would inevitably fall. The Shanghai market's monthly actual sales are no more than 30,000 bags, while the production quantity exceeds 100,000 bags. Furthermore, foreign flour continues to be imported, reaching 300,000 large bags, posing a major threat to the flour industry.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchant Registrations Less Than Half</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Social Affairs Bureau began handling the registration of foreign-owned companies and businesses, as of the end of July, 18 foreign companies and over 340 businesses have registered. It is estimated that there are over 1,000 foreign companies and businesses in this city, and currently, less than half have registered.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Reluctant to Call at Shanghai Due to Slow Unloading and High Costs</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 15th] Most of China's coastal shipping is still controlled by two British shipping companies, Jardine Matheson and Swire. Their ships regularly travel between various ports in South China and Shanghai and Hong Kong. However, many foreign ships that do not regularly sail these routes are considering not calling at Shanghai because of high loading and unloading costs and slow unloading. Instead, they would unload in Hong Kong and then transship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Prosperity in Seafood</p>
<p>Dried shrimp tails are scarce and sales are brisk. The price increase is quite strong. Longkou vermicelli is favored by the Cantonese community, and the market situation is becoming tighter, creating a new high. Hunan lotus seeds are currently in short supply. The autumn season for fragrant mushrooms has arrived, and the production area market is upside down, so the situation is quite promising. Dried mussels and Job's tears are stable and firm. However, large sago, black moss, crab roe, and dried prawns have sluggish sales. For the rest of the goods, there is more prosperity than decline.</p>
<h3>As Shipping Dates Approach, Foreign Firms are Active in Tea</h3>
<p>The tea market situation continues to be strong in domestic sales. In the foreign firms' tea market, both British and Indian firms are still active. Wuyuan's newly extracted premium tea was absorbed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. at 28 chests, with the price reaching a high of 230,000 yuan per dan, a soaring increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yu Long &amp; Co. imported 164 chests of old Special Tribute tea. Wu Chang Tea Company purchased 37 chests of old Special Qimen tea, and also 72 chests of Chen Zhenmei tea. Da De Chang Tea Company collected 50 groups of Bai Lin aged black tea. Other varieties each had their own activity. Furthermore, it is understood that Jardine Matheson, Xie He, and other foreign firms sent personnel to Hangzhou last week to search for red and green tea. They have now returned to Shanghai. It is said that the inventory there is also as sparse as stars in the morning sky, and the sellers' asking prices are limitless, making it difficult to purchase for the time being. Therefore, the focus of attention has shifted back to this city.</p>
<h3>The Key to the Tung Oil Export Problem Lies in Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tung oil has always been a major export commodity of our country. During the War of Resistance, production shrank due to traffic congestion. The situation has not improved after victory. The United States has always been the main sales market for exports. However, because the price of tung oil produced in South America is currently cheaper than domestic goods, and at the same time, the United States has invented substitutes made from castor oil, domestic goods have been greatly affected. However, the quality of our country's tung oil is better, so it can still maintain a portion of the sales market. The main problem is still how to increase production and facilitate transportation. Currently, China Vegetable Oil Factory is engaged in the export trade of tung oil. From the victory until now, the factory has exported a total of about 10,000 tons of tung oil, with each ton consisting of 20 dan and each dan priced at 70,000 national currency, for a total value of about 140 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Autumn Harvest: Rice and Grain Abundant, Cotton and Tobacco Diminished</h3>
<p>The cotton fields along the south bank of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province have had a diminished harvest this year. The cotton picking season has arrived, and cotton farmers are struggling to break even. The tobacco leaf harvest has been completed, with the yield being 30% lower than last year. However, the rice-producing areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have had a very good harvest this year, 20-30% higher than last year. Therefore, recently, rice prices have plummeted from Jinhua and Lanxi all the way to Zhuji, with new rice being only 25,000 yuan per shi. It is heard that the new rice harvest in Jiangxi Province is even more abundant than in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 packages of Xuzhou tobacco leaves have recently arrived in Shanghai, and tobacco leaf prices have already weakened.</p>
<h3>Foreign Estimates of Rice and Wheat Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 15th] It is estimated that China's wheat harvest can reach 22,400,000 tons, compared to 18,600,000 tons last year, and 22,600,000 tons before the war. The rice harvest is only 39,500,000 tons, compared to 45,000,000 tons before the war.</p>
<p>[Paris, 15th] It is estimated that the next season's rice harvest in French Indochina will reach 4,490,000 tons, and exports may reach 160,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Situation</h3>
<p>It is heard that Customs will auction off a large batch of enemy and puppet goods of Lauan plywood, and the market sentiment is weak, causing the market price to fall back. Due to the continued arrival of fir wood, the price is also not expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Averse to Risk, Short Selling Active: Chinese Stocks Remain Weak, Foreign Stocks See Sudden Surge in Buying</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks lack encouragement from major players and are further ravaged by short selling, like a collapsing building. Floating capital is gradually becoming averse to risk. Various stocks continue to revolve and decline, with high prices in the morning and low prices in the afternoon. Midday high prices were 660 yuan for Yong Spinning, 3,690 yuan for Meiya, 213 yuan for Jingfu, 210 yuan for Xinguang, and 158 yuan for Qinxing. The near-noon low prices were 635 yuan for Yong Spinning, 3,450 yuan for Meiya, 195 yuan for Jingfu, 190 yuan for Xinguang, and 135 yuan for Qinxing. At noon, the market turned sluggish and business was quiet. The interest rate was reduced to 7.5 fen to 1 jiao 0.5 fen. Futures were lower than spot prices by 4 yuan, showing the bleak market conditions. Smaller and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down slightly. Veteran stocks were flat and weak, and the trend was not optimistic. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong Spinning and Meiya decreased slightly, and the three smaller hot stocks such as Jingfu also decreased by less than half a percent. The colder small and medium-sized stocks declined slightly, and the veteran stocks were flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks suddenly saw a surge in buying. On the Chinese stock side, some floating capital was absorbed due to low prices. Major players such as Da Kang Cheng frequently absorbed shares. Foreign merchants had a healthy buying appetite. Yisha rose from 7,700 to 8,700, and then slightly retreated. British Union rose step by step from 7,900 to 8,750 yuan. Other stocks were also driven up. Foreign merchants were more eager to absorb Yecheng. The situation has improved. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the paper industry alone rose strongly by 10%, Yisha and British Union rebounded by 10%, and Yeguang, Hutchison, and Asia Steel each rose by half a percent. Although Yip Beer rose, it was not much.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Japonica Rice Still Scarce, Foreign Rice Distributed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 5,000 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets, mostly of medium and lower quality. The market situation remained high for high-quality and sluggish for lower-quality rice. White Yuan rice was scarce and sales were brisk, with an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Due to the cloudy weather and limited supply, it also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. 10,000 bags of Brazilian foreign rice, totaling 5,000 shi, were distributed to the North and South markets at a price of 54,000 yuan. Including expenses, the retail price at stores was 59,000 yuan. The supply and demand of flour were evenly matched, and the market situation was temporarily stable. Foreign flour continued to be sold. Shantou and Xiamen temporarily stopped absorbing wheat. The sales of white wheat were also sluggish. New soybeans from Gan, Anhui, Bian, and Wujin continued to arrive. High-quality goods still had a way to be sold, but medium and lower-quality goods had little trading and fell by 400-500 yuan. Aged soybeans decreased slightly by 500-600 yuan. Oil mills' absorption was also weak. Broad beans had gradually become scarce recently. The arrival of oil increased, and shops were looking forward to sales. All oils decreased uniformly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The season for soybean cake consumption had passed, and it decreased again by 100-200 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas became more active, stopping the decline and rebounding by 100-200 yuan.</p>
<h3>No More Control Over New US Cotton</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 15th] In response to the question of whether the 1946 cotton harvest would also be subject to price restrictions under the New Price Control Act, officials from the Price Control Bureau recently replied that they believed that such a move would be illegal under the New Price Act. Therefore, they do not intend to impose price controls, and also said that President Truman has signed a bill prohibiting the trading, allocation, and acreage designation of the 1947 cotton, peanut, and other harvests.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Yarn and Cloth are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was sluggish, and actual sales remained sluggish. Fellow traders' spirits were low, and they were not concerned about gains and losses for the time being. Large-sized Shuangma yarn decreased by 20,000 to 30,000, and small to medium-sized yarns were also weak by about 10,000. However, various brands of 20-count yarns produced by the Textile Construction Corporation remained stable because small weaving factories had some selection and trade.</p>
<p>The trend of grey cloth turned flat. Due to the decline in the yarn market, actual sales were not smooth, so morale weakened again. The Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell Pique fabric and had a large supply. The market declined, falling by 750 yuan. However, the grey cloth from private factories was eagerly sought by the South, and the market situation remained at its original level. The Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell as usual, and the market declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices are on the Rise, the Ninth Period has been Distributed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a spokesperson from the Second Section of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the ninth period of edible sugar has now been completely distributed. To alleviate the sugar shortage in other locations, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided that the next period of sugar will be exclusively allocated to other locations, and the eleventh period will resume allocation to sugar merchants in this city.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for medium and fine sugar lacked distribution from the company and relied solely on goods from the Fujian and Wenzhou gangs. The supply was indeed limited, so market prices continued to rise. The opening price increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Other sugars such as Xinghua white sugar also followed suit. The upper grade opened at 142,000 yuan, and the lower grade at 138,000 to 136,000 yuan, with over 100 transactions. The Shantou gang opened with refined green sugar at 95,000 yuan and washed green sugar at 94,000 to 93,500 yuan, with over 400 packages transacted. The price of raw brown sugar allocated by the company to the trading companies was set at 70,000 yuan, with a quantity of approximately 30,000 packages.</p>
<h3>After Sugar Prices are Suppressed and Stabilized, Candy and Preserves are Reduced in Price</h3>
<p>Since the Confectionery, Candy, Canned Goods, and Bread Industry Association of this city obtained sugar allocation, it has reduced the selling prices of its products accordingly. For example, candy was reduced by 1.34%, preserves by 25%, and pastries by 20%. The quality remains the same. Biscuit prices remain unchanged because the coal used still needs to be purchased on the black market.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Continues, Affecting Foreign Bonds</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 14th] According to the Financial Times, after Special Envoy Marshall stated that a peaceful resolution to China's internal problems was currently impossible, Chinese bonds in London fell across the board and were virtually ignored. The market was bleak, and prices fell by three pounds. The 4.5% interest bonds of 1898 fell to 66 pounds, the 5% interest bonds of 1912 and 1913 each fell to 46 pounds and 50 pounds respectively. The 5% Boxer Indemnity bonds fell to 68 pounds. The 5% South Manchuria Railway bonds fell to 28 pounds.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Agricultural Experiment Station: Our Newspaper's Taipei Airmail Report of the 8th: Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station, with agricultural experimentation as its center, is one of the most extensive research institutions in the province. It boasts ten experimental branch stations spread throughout the province, encompassing horticulture, tea, animal husbandry, tropical agriculture, and other departments. The depth of agricultural experimentation during the Japanese colonial period of Taiwan, spanning fifty years, is strikingly evident. At the time of the takeover, the station had a total of 332 personnel, all of whom were Japanese except for eight Taiwanese. Currently, they retain 67 Japanese technicians. Although more than 40 people have been newly added from other provinces, the lack of high-level research talent will be felt keenly when these Japanese return to their country this year, necessitating recruitment from various domestic sources.</p>
<h3>Eight New Varieties are Superior to Taiwan Rice Varieties</h3>
<p>Most of Taiwan is subtropical, allowing for year-round crop cultivation. Rice can be grown twice a year in the north. The Japanese gradually expanded existing block farms into concentrated farms. To maximize land use, they studied and adopted a system of crop rotation, potentially involving three crops: rice, sugarcane, and potatoes/flax. These crop varieties were developed and supplied by the station. Due to the large-scale demand for food during the war, the Chiayi Experimental Branch Station collected 399 species of sweet potatoes from around the world and cultivated 30 improved varieties, promoting them throughout the province. Previously, local varieties averaged only 27% dried sweet potato yield, but now the improved varieties yield 36%. In terms of starch content, the improved varieties have 26%, compared to the local varieties' 17%, which is highly beneficial for the fermentation industry. The Japanese favored Penglai rice. Over decades, they cultivated eight new varieties. Their quality and yield are superior to local varieties. Three varieties are still being tested in various regions.</p>
<h3>Two Special Medicines are Particularly Difficult to Propagate</h3>
<p>The agronomy department has over 1,000 mu of farmland for experimentation. The reporter, guided by Mr. Ji Jingyuan, surveyed the experimental fields where the second rice crop had been completed. He said: The department is the main backbone of the general station. Currently, there are fewer experiments being conducted. Most efforts are focused on variety preservation. Among fiber crops, 75 species of jute and 60 species of ramie are being preserved. Among oil crops, 65 species of peanuts, 21 species of sesame, and over ten species of sunflowers are being preserved. The medicinal plants *Yusaki Kudzu* (see picture), a special medicine for lung disease, and *Hongtou Teng*, both wild on sandy soils at mountain peaks, have round underground stems that can be extracted to treat tuberculosis. When transplanted to flat land, they require strong sunlight, high temperatures, dryness, and ample rainfall. Furthermore, the vines need to be supported with frames. Because they do not easily produce seeds, and the seeds are difficult to germinate after being produced, propagation is limited. There are also varieties of *Kumis Kuelin*, which can be extracted to treat kidney disease, and three insecticidal agents that have been widely studied domestically: *Tephrosia vogelii* and *Guangdong Shulang*.</p>
<p>We especially visited the agricultural machinery exhibition room. There were no specially made agricultural machines, only a common rice thresher. Its needles are made of iron wire, which is slightly better than the ones made of iron nails used domestically. According to Mr. Ji, they are currently only doing variety preservation work, but recently even this has become a problem because of a lack of fertilizer! The Japanese researched a forecast device for abundant and lean years, based on a comprehensive estimate of weather, rainfall, etc., and created an instrument. It has been 12 years, and they still haven't gotten results!</p>

<h3>Five Major Pests: Investigation, Research, and Implementation of Eradication</h3>
<p>Over a hundred species of pests pose a great threat to rice. The five major pests are stem borers, leafhoppers, rice beetles, leaf miners, and stink bugs. At their worst, these pests can completely destroy the rice crop. Stem borers usually damage about 3% to 5% of the crop annually. Leafhoppers occur in September and October during years with little rainfall. Rice beetles and leaf miners occur during the early stages of the second and first crops, reducing the harvest by about 20% to 30%. Black stink bugs and spider stink bugs both damage the rice stems, absorbing nutrients and causing a reduction in yield of over 10%.</p>
<p>There are 44 species of pests that infest sweet potatoes. The most damaging is the sweet potato weevil, which damages the sweet potato roots, causing rot and even total crop failure. Among the pests of fruit trees and vegetables, those related to exported agricultural products are the Citrus and Mango Fruit Fly, which infests citrus and mango fruits and is widely distributed in Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, and the Melon Fly, which infests melons. The U.S. plant inspection authorities also pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, these pests have been investigated using moth traps to determine the number of stem borer moths killed and the status of occurrence. Statistical research has been conducted, and data on stem borer moth occurrence is currently being organized to make predictions. Currently, research is being conducted on the control of stem borers affecting rice and the control of sweet potato weevils damaging sweet potatoes using chemical methods. Trials are also underway on the impact of chemical spraying on tea trees, as well as investigations into vegetable pests, scale insects, and beneficial insects (natural enemies).</p>
<p>In the agricultural chemistry laboratory, a technician from mainland China is analyzing the effective components in sweet potato black spot disease and solidified starch. He said that he is preparing to complete the chemical analysis of iron-based purification.</p>
<h3>Hainan Island Pig Breed: Thin Skin, Delicious Taste, High Reproductive Capacity</h3>
<p>The animal husbandry of this province is declining. The main livestock is pigs, with production second only to rice and sugar. The highest number of pigs raised in the province was 1.8 million, with an average of 4.5 pigs per farm household. The annual slaughter number was approximately 1.2 million. However, there are currently only 300,000 to 500,000 heads. This sharp decline is due to a lack of feed, lax control, and a lack of government incentives!</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li Dongliang of the animal husbandry department, most of the world's best breeds contain Asian blood, but this characteristic is often overlooked. They are currently conducting surveys and research on pig breeds in the southern region, hoping to obtain Asian pig breeds and select them for improvement. The focus of the work is the Hainan Island pig.</p>
<p>(1) To improve Taiwan pig breeds, the Taoyuan pig of this province and the Berkshire pig of England were used in progressive breeding up to the third generation. Then, inbreeding was performed to fix its performance, and selection and elimination were carried out to breed a pure black pig breed similar to the Taoyuan pig in color and the Berkshire pig in body shape (see picture). Its advantages have not yet been determined, so it cannot be promoted.</p>
<p>(2) Research on the Hainan Island pig breed. Its body shape is unique: small ears, concave back, drooping belly, thin bones, and short legs. The hair on the neck and back is black, while the abdomen and limbs are white. The forehead often has a white triangular star. It belongs to the Asian family, the Chinese small-eared flower pig breed. The meat is delicious, the skin is thin, and the reproductive capacity is strong. It is a medium-sized fatty pig breed. They are currently continuing research and may become one of the best breeds in South China in the future (see picture).</p>
<p>Mr. Shitian, a Japanese who has worked with pigs for 14 years, led the reporter up the hillside to visit the pigsty he designed and the processed animal products: ham, cured meat, sausage, and liver powder and casings made from livestock organs. When he presented a string of white and thin casings as light as gauze, he said: "China imports a large quantity of casings from the United States every year. The production method should be improved as soon as possible!"</p>
<p>In 1941, the Japanese allocated 13 taels of meat per person, which was later changed to one tael. After the recovery, the allocation was cancelled. We are now eating the most expensive meat in the country, at 96 Taiwan dollars per catty. Shitian said: "This is probably the result of a lack of management!"</p>

<h3>Regulations</h3>
<p>Hoping the Suzhou Power Plant Will Devise Methods to Fully Supply Electricity</p>
<p>To the Editor: Ancient Suzhou lags behind in all endeavors. Since the victory, the railway authority is perhaps the only entity that has been relatively satisfactory. During the enemy and puppet regime, taking the train was a headache. Now, that's all gone, and travel is convenient. However, the power plant authority, since taking over from the enemy and puppet regime, has stopped supplying electricity during the day. This has forced existing factories to shut down, leading to increased unemployment. Despite repeated appeals and petitions from relevant industrial and commercial sectors, the plant has shown no signs of improvement. Compared to Shanghai and Wuxi, where electricity flows day and night, it's hard not to feel envious! Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Fuel Commission has significantly increased coal allocation to Suzhou. Yet, the power plant authority continues to collect coal surcharges from factories monthly, pricing it at black market rates, causing the cost of electricity to far exceed that of lighting. Factories have already paid a hefty price but cannot fully utilize it. Before the incident, Suzhou had 500 factories of varying sizes, all reliant on electricity for power. Even amidst eight years of turmoil, there has been some progress, with the total number of factories approaching 800. Since the victory last year, less than 200 have resumed operations. Furthermore, they can only start production after 2 PM when the plant opens the electricity supply. From 8 PM to 10 PM, the power plant authority automatically cuts power to divert it for lighting. If this continues, Suzhou's existing factories will inevitably revert to closure. The Suzhou power plant authority bears the heavy responsibility of being the primary driver of the city's production. It is hoped that they will devise methods for improvement soon. I eagerly await this! (Survival)</p>

<p>Hotels' Alarming Price Hike</p>
<p>To the Editor: This 60% price increase in the hotel industry is, in effect, a vanguard for rising prices. Now that prices of various goods have begun to fall, why is the hotel industry alone increasing its prices? It is truly puzzling. I am a civil servant who came to Shanghai in early April. Unable to rent a house, I moved into a hotel on Xinzha Road. At that time, the rent was 3,060 yuan per day, accounting for only one-third of my income. Now, in less than four months, it has increased to 9,420 yuan per day, which my entire monthly income cannot even cover for rent. I recall that before the war, the room I stayed in cost only 8 jiao per day. The current price is more than 10,000 times higher! Isn't that alarming? Even rice, at its most expensive, is only about 6,000 times more expensive than before the war. The authorities should pay close attention to this. Do not ignore the hotel industry's price increases, allowing them to rise unchecked. The majority of guests staying in hotels now are civil servants, and some have even fled from the liberated areas, all suffering immensely. Furthermore, price increases in one industry are connected to other industries. Do not overlook this, as it is no small contribution to the well-being of society! (Chen Yixing)</p>
<h3>The Chess Game in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Our Yangzhou Dispatch on the 10th, Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>The current situation in Northern Jiangsu is like a game of chess, with the National Army on one side and the Communist Army on the other.</p>
<p>Negotiations are continuing, albeit tenuously, in Lushan and Nanjing, with the Northern Jiangsu issue being a major point of discussion. The government, citing Northern Jiangsu's proximity to the capital region, demands that the Communist Army withdraw north of the Longhai Railway. Will the Communist Party relinquish Northern Jiangsu? This is a question people are anxiously pondering. While negotiations have yet to yield results, an observer quietly watching the game in Northern Jiangsu already understands the possible developments.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's military occupation, political, and economic "revolution" in Northern Jiangsu are well-known. However, we must reiterate that the Chinese Communist Party is not a political party "seeking the welfare of the people," as it claims. Instead, it is an absolute violent group determined to "seize the country." When the Northeast was in turmoil, it sought to seize the Northeast. When Beijing and Shanghai were vulnerable, it even attempted to infiltrate them. Therefore, asking it to relinquish Northern Jiangsu is akin to cutting off its flesh.</p>
<p>The Communist Party promotes an advanced Marxist communist theory, but its actions are no different from those of ancient bandits. The 1950s are an era of scientific masses, where people adhere to truth, not submit to violence. Looking at the members of the Communist Party, one feels they are truly the scourge of China!</p>
<p>The peasant uprisings of ancient China are greatly admired by the Communist Party. Thus, it gathers those who dream of such "heroic dreams," wanting to conquer the world from horseback regardless of consequences. Consequently, its first priority is to cultivate military force. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it recruited soldiers and bought horses for eight full years. Upon victory, it struck it rich even more. Documents captured by the National Army from the Communist Party serve as proof:</p>
<p>"Japan has unconditionally surrendered. The handling of puppet army and puppet organization personnel will be carried out in accordance with the following orders from the Military Affairs Department: All puppet army and puppet organization personnel who voluntarily surrender to us will be granted the following three guarantees: (1) Guarantee the safety of life and property of all surrendering officers and soldiers; (2) Guarantee that units will not be disbanded or disarmed; (3) Guarantee existing official positions and not deprive military power."</p>
<p>This document was jointly issued by the Headquarters of the First Military Sub-district of the Communist Party's Central China Military Region, its Political Department, and the Commissioner's Office of the First Administrative Region.</p>
<p>Think about it: the Communist Party is composed of such elements. What benefits can it bring to the people? What democracy can it fight for? Northern Jiangsu—this lamb struggling under the Communist Party's knife has already voiced its human anger!</p>
<p>The government authorities cannot turn a blind eye to this fact. The government's demand that the Communist Army withdraw from Northern Jiangsu is not only for the security of the capital but also to rescue the people of Northern Jiangsu from their suffering.</p>
<p>However, the government cannot use force as casually as the Communist Party. Therefore, it painstakingly seeks to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means—the Northern Jiangsu issue being one of them.</p>
<p>But what if political means cannot solve the problem? Will the situation be allowed to drag on indefinitely? Will a public denunciation be issued?</p>
<p>I believe neither will happen because the National Army is silently playing this chess game.</p>
<p>The pieces have been arranged. With the movement of a few pieces, the situation will be initially settled. Observers will immediately understand that although the National Army is in a passive position, its strategy is superior, leaving the opponent powerless and threatening to destabilize the entire board.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation has calmed down. Only the advance and retreat of individual soldiers are seen on the chessboard, seemingly insignificant but precisely strategic maneuvers.</p>
<p>The National Army's chariots, horses, and cannons are all positioned in appropriate locations, posing a terrifying power to the opponent. Not only are the attacking pieces in danger of being annihilated, but the entire army also risks being wiped out. An inferior player, though not highly skilled, should know that timely withdrawal is the best strategy. A superior chess player does not need to pursue the attack to win the game!</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Trip - Three</p>
<h3>Tragedy in "Paradise"</h3>
<p>— Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 10th, Reporter Huang Xing Tian</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a sensational tragedy occurred in the quiet city of Hangzhou, giving idlers in teahouses and wine shops more material for gossip. It turns out that Wang Jinyu, a young woman from Poyang, Jiangxi, and the wealthy daughter of a tycoon, only 23 years old, unwilling to endure the abuse of her stepmother, eloped with her lover, Huang Baohe, a fellow student. They brought fourteen trunks of valuables, hoping to establish a happy and fulfilling small family in this "paradise."</p>
<p>However, upon arriving in Jianggan, Huang Baohe suddenly took twelve trunks of valuables worth over 14 million, claiming he was going ahead to find a house. The infatuated Wang Jinyu waited for him for six hours but never saw him return. She had no choice but to have the boatman take her to the West Lake Hotel. Wang, having lost her lover and her wealth, was filled with extreme resentment. After staying for two days, she met Chen Shaoyun, a singer, Wang's wife, and Ren Tianfu, a West Lake boatman, and A Kang, inviting her to stay in their house. They discovered that Wang still had a large sum of money hidden in the two small leather trunks she possessed. On the evening of the 4th, they invited Wang Jinyu to sail on West Lake, introducing a friend who claimed he could help find her fellow townsmen. The next morning, they brought their friend, Li Yongchang, claiming to have found them. They then took Wang's small leather trunks and left together. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the intersection of Yingshi Street and Yue Wang Road, they separately escaped by car. Wang Jinyu cried for help, losing five gold rings, 800,000 yuan in legal tender, and other belongings. Eventually, she felt hopeless and wanted to throw herself into the river at Pinghai Bridge. She was excessively saddened and cried all the way, so her attempted suicide was prevented, and she was taken to the police station. When asked why she wanted to commit suicide, Wang Jinyu frankly said: "Hangzhou has so many villains. What's the point of me living in such a world, with such a fate?"</p>
<p>The world is like this, and fate depends on the path you take. Wang Jinyu's tragedy has become a joke on people's lips. One moment, it's rumored that the boatman Ren Tianfu tried to rape her. Another moment, it's said that a man "abandoned by his concubine" is willing to keep her company, so that everyone gets what they want...…. The teahouses and hotels are in an uproar, and the newspaper supplements are also discussing it vigorously. Some pity Wang Jinyu, others scold her for being romantic, and still others curse this feudal system and this dark society. However, whether pitied or scolded, society is as it is, and Wang Jinyu has ultimately become a victim. Although the police accidentally caught Li Yongchang while cracking down on gambling, accidental is ultimately accidental. This is truly a serious social problem in a transitional period.</p>
<p>Following the Wang Jinyu incident, there was another small wave in Hangzhou society: Zhou Zuoping, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, went missing. Two days later, Zhou Zuoping's wife received a letter, which was a suicide note sent by Zhou Zuoping through a friend. The main idea was that he was a poor civil servant, struggling financially, and unwilling to live any longer. Since the newspaper found his "whereabouts"—death—regardless of whether Zhou Zuoping jumped into the turbid tides of the Qiantang River or hanged himself in the desolate mountains, apart from civil servants feeling "sorrow for each other," society had long forgotten him completely. Wang Jinyu is a semi-new and semi-old woman cultivated in the feudal environment of the inland. She jumped out of the family prison with full dreams, but she didn't know the complexity of the world, the cruelty of society. A simple and enthusiastic girl was finally ruined in the clutches of a sinful society. And Zhou Zuoping, who killed him? Although he did not have heroic aspirations, did he not have a pair of hands willing to work hard? But he went missing and committed suicide! In today's world where our country and society are facing such a serious crisis, the reporter can't help but express sympathy for the characters in the tragedy and accuse the "heroes" who disrupt social order and disturb people's lives!</p>

<h3>Political Hurricane in Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Our Guilin Air Dispatch on the 4th, Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>In mid-July, a hurricane raging in the Pacific Ocean, carrying a weary body, spiraled into the high skies of the scorching southwest, slowly turning into a melancholic cyclone. A cold rain fell, and the hurricane silently dissipated. However, the political hurricane, hidden beneath the surface, unable to be concealed or resisted any longer, spread with an overwhelming force. A storm agitated the minds of those in power, frightened the corrupt officials, slapped the hands of the common people, and kept the reporter's pen busy. Accusations flew! An astonishingly large opium case!</p>
<h3>First Shot: Telling the People to Plant "Wheat"</h3>
<p>As early as two years ago, in winter, just as the enemy cavalry was invading westward and the flames of war were nearing the Yangtze, Guangxi's fate was also teetering on the brink of crisis. Baise, a small mountain town far away on the western frontier, unexpectedly became Guangxi's military and political center, and the remote and desolate counties west of Baise became the targets of those with a deep thirst for officialdom. It was in that complex environment that an opium case worth 140 million yuan, containing a huge political conspiracy, was unveiled.</p>
<p>First, two notorious scoundrels in official circles, one named Huang Qi and the other named Luo Chengjun, after much maneuvering, were appointed as county magistrates of Xilong and Xilin respectively. These two places are far on the borders of Guizhou and Guangxi, with steep mountains and forests, practically outside the sphere of civilization. Only in such uncivilized places could an unparalleled opium case arise. Before taking office, these two magistrates are said to have received many secret instructions, the main one being "Plant as much opium as possible," "Exchange opium for money," and "Use money to buy guns." The use of money and guns was an unspeakable secret in those turbulent days. And so it was, after this and that, the two villains took office. Their first move was to issue verbal and written orders to village cadres: "To implement administrative orders, money is essential; but where does the money come from? Naturally, only from planting large amounts of 'wheat' (a clever euphemism for 'opium')!" Once the verbal order was given, it was carried out swiftly and thoroughly. The next step was to open gambling dens. The magistrate ordered the planting of opium and the opening of gambling dens. Truly, his kindness and virtue were profound! Plant, then! Gamble, then! As a result, wheat fields turned green everywhere, and the sounds of fan-tan gambling echoed. Administrative personnel were overjoyed, wealth flowed like water, and Customs Gold piled up like mountains. From the magistrate to the janitors, all were "stuffed to death." The Customs Gold stored in the magistrate's house was uncountable and could only be measured with a ruler. When workers poured water for the magistrate's face every day, they stole more than 4 million yuan, grabbing handfuls from the piles of banknotes. Truly, there was nothing like it before or since.</p>
<h3>Two Scoundrels Dust Off Their Butts and Flee</h3>
<p>From the growth of opium seedlings to their transformation into "hawthorn cakes" (opium paste), the common people's flesh and blood were squeezed dry. At that time, the "orders" to "remit funds" arrived urgently and in succession. Thus, two hundred long-gun carrying police officers escorted several dozen loads of banknotes, crossing mountains and ridges, requisitioning food from peasants along the way, as if facing a formidable enemy, all the way to Baise. Only then was the task completed, and the credit recorded in the ledger. At this time, the virtuous Chairman Huang was recuperating in Chengdu and had not yet returned. Provincial affairs were being handled by Chen Liangzuo, the Commissioner of Civil Affairs. Following the outflow of banknotes, the people of Xilong and Xilin Counties sent countless telegrams and letters of denunciation, creating a city-wide sensation in Baise, known to all. The total extortion of 140 million yuan, written as numerals, is 1,400,000,000 yuan, a string of zeros, how could this be! It is said that Commissioner Chen was quite opposed to evil and immediately dispatched personnel for "thorough investigation." At the same time, someone made an urgent phone call to the two counties to "secretly investigate." Strangely, the phone call turned into a telegram. Some people could only hear a series of numbers like "2714.4099.6643.6382" on the phone. As soon as the phone call was made, the personnel dispatched for thorough investigation were still climbing the mountains, but Huang Qi and Luo Chengjun could no longer wait, dusted off their butts, and fled.</p>
<p>It should also be reported that the two gentlemen "escaped" extremely comfortably. They stayed in Chongqing for a while, and after Guilin was liberated, they ran back to Guilin, staying there for a short time. Hearing that they were wanted, they are now taking a boat to Hong Kong to escape the heat. Coincidentally, they were on the same boat as the wife of a commissioner heading east. When the case broke, the provincial government was in Baise, the Liangguang Inspectorate was in Baise, the Commander's Headquarters was in Baise, and countless other political figures were gathered there. However, the weather in Baise was too bad. All I can tell readers is about the weather. As for who received how many millions of banknotes, who received the most gifts at what time, those are all old rumors.</p>
<h3>Journey to Mount Tianmu</h3>
<p>— Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>"Mount Tianmu hangs down two breasts, dragons fly and phoenixes dance to Qiantang," these are Guo Jingchun's verses about Mount Tianmu. The two breasts of Tianmu likely refer to two streams, one being the water of East Tianmu, which flows through Lin'an; forming the three streams of Zhongtiao, Nantiao, and Beichao. When mountain torrents come, they surge and dance, rushing down thousands of miles, capable of inundating the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wuxing areas. It is said that Chen Hun once dug a large pond thirty miles in circumference in Yuhang to store water, avoiding damage to the fertile fields of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Wuxing. Now, in addition to South Lake in Yuhang, there is also a North Lake. It is said that the water of East Tianmu flows directly to Tai Lake. The water of West Tianmu forms Tianmu Creek, flowing into the Qiantang River.</p>
<p>Having admired the name of Mount Tianmu, and urgently needing to know the recent situation of the counties near Tianmu, the reporter embarked on a journey to Mount Tianmu. The plan was to pass through the four western Zhejiang counties of Yuhang, Lin'an, Yuqian, and Yuhua.</p>
<h3>Visiting Yuhang and Lin'an at the Foot of the Mountain</h3>
<p>Traveling from Hangzhou to Yuhang, it was expected that the road would be quite bad, as the drivers of ten-wheeled trucks were particularly cautious. Fortunately, nothing went wrong, and we arrived safely. I inquired with many local people, the county government, and local figures, and learned that the Zhongtiao, Nantiao, and Beichao Streams were all silted up. South Lake was also gradually unable to hold the amount of water flowing down from the Chao Streams due to the accumulation of too much mud and sand. Locals emphasized that if South Lake was not repaired, when South Lake overflowed, it would flood the western Zhejiang Plain, which would be terrible.</p>
<p>Over the past eight or nine years, Yuhang has suffered the ravages of the enemy and puppet regime. Therefore, it is extremely dilapidated. Famous throughout the country for its silk production, Yuhang now feels hopeless because 80% of the mulberry forests have been sacrificed. Due to the loss of mulberry forests, it is impossible to raise silkworms, let alone produce silk. The abandoned mulberry forest area has not been planted with anything else. Moreover, a considerable portion of the county's 190,000 mu of fertile land and 500,000 mu of mountainous land is also barren. This may be due to labor difficulties, but according to surveys, the original population of 130,000 has now reached over 110,000, a difference of just over 20,000.</p>
<p>Silk production cannot be revived, so the famous Yuhang silk cotton has also declined sharply. In its heyday, there were 300,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and 45,000 jin of silk cotton, but now there are fewer than 100,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and less than 10,000 jin of silk cotton.</p>
<p>Another economic enterprise of Yuhang is the export of calligraphy brush handles. Yuhang has many small bamboo branches that can be used as brush handles. Only Yuhang bamboo can be used to make brush handles. Before the war, they sold well throughout the country, especially in North China, Northeast China, and North Jiangsu. Now, due to the presence of the Communist Party, they cannot be transported north.</p>
<p>They also produce some yellow and white paper. Yellow paper is used for sacrificial burning, mainly sold in North Jiangsu. White paper can be written on and is also sold in North Jiangsu. Now, both are stagnant, with no sales at all. Due to the lack of production opportunities, Yuhang has turned to commerce, or the export of goods from the western Zhejiang mountains. Other daily necessities are imported, such as bamboo shoots, chestnuts, white fruit, and mountain walnuts from Changhua, but due to the sluggish market and stagnant sales, they are gradually declining. When the reporter arrived in Yuhang, dozens of mountain goods stores had already closed, revealing immense difficulties.</p>
<p>Traveling from Yuhang to Lin'an, the road gradually worsened. The car struggled through mud ditches and deep pits, barely making it to Lin'an, but both the people and the car were exhausted. Lin'an suffered terrible bombing by enemy planes during the War of Resistance. Almost nothing was left standing in the city. Now, some thatched sheds and low houses have been built, but they are scattered, showing desolation and sadness.</p>
<p>On the way to Mount Tianmu</p>
<p>The picture shows the state of disrepair of the Hanghui National Highway. (Note: All the Mount Tianmu pictures were taken by Zhang Zichun)</p>
<h3>More Mountains Than Land, More Land Than Fields</h3>
<p>In Lin'an, there are more mountains than land, and more land than fields. The population is only 60,099. Terraced fields outnumber flat fields. It is said that 68% of the land is terraced. Because of this, when mountain water comes, the erosive effect is particularly strong. Although we are accustomed to seeing barren stony mountains in Guizhou in the rear, if protection measures are not taken here, the same phenomenon will occur. If they become barren mountains, when the Tianmu River floods, it will inundate the area for miles, and the harvest of fields will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Bamboo and wood are the main products here, especially dried bamboo shoots, which are famous throughout the country. There are three types of dried bamboo shoots: one is "baked shoot heads," the most tender shoot tips; one is "fat, bald shoots," the older shoot tips; and one is "early rounds," early bamboo shoots that are harvested and made into round shapes. To make dried bamboo shoots, they dig out the tender shoots, boil them in a pot with salt, and then dry them. After they are made, they are packed in bamboo strips and sold in the market. These dried bamboo shoots have an extremely delicious flavor and can last for a long time. If they can be improved further, they can be sold abroad on a large scale, because foreign beef jerky is not even a fraction as good as the taste of dried bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>The uses of wood include charcoal, incense powder, and firewood. Recently, except for large timber, firewood and charcoal have sold better. Incense powder is used for burning incense and lighting candles. Because sales in northern Jiangsu are not smooth, it is not managed on a large scale. I think it would be better to use incense powder to make mosquito coils.</p>
<p>Bamboo can be used to make woodenware, and raw bamboo is also sold outside. It is bundled into posts of dozens or tens of stems, selling about 30,000 to 40,000 posts, but recently, due to the impact of the current situation, sales are not so good.</p>
<p>Other products include silk and tea, but in general, they are entering a state of recession.</p>
<p>When I was in Yuhang, I heard that Yuhang was plagued by rice stem borers, but when I came to Lin'an and met local people, I learned that the rice stem borers were even more severe than in Yuhang. Government personnel, because they have no medicines, no equipment, no tools, and no appropriate methods, let the pitiful and lovely farmers pray to gods and worship Buddhas, and welcome divine guests. After Chairman Shen's inspection tour, he ordered the provincial government to find ways to remedy the situation. As far as this reporter knows, the best way to control rice stem borers is of course medicine. If there is no medicine, wooden or bamboo pieces can be made into large combs to comb them off. We hope that Yuhang and Lin'an counties, which already lack grain production, will no longer neglect the harm of rice stem borers.</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Lin'an, you can see Tianmu Mountain, towering high into the clouds, like a huge celestial phenomenon. A few clouds have entered its mountainside and can no longer smooth its back.</p>
<p>Looking back, we see the pagoda on the mountain in Lin'an. Local people told me that this pagoda is to commemorate King Qian Wusu, called the Gongchen Pagoda, to express respect for Qian Liu. Qian Liu was indeed from Lin'an, and his tomb is still buried there. There is a shrine in front of his tomb, and the relics of stone men and horses suggest the grandeur and prosperity of the past, but recently it seems that few people have cleaned it up, so it also shows a dilapidated appearance.</p>
<p>Local people told me that this is considered to be at the foot of Tianmu Mountain.</p>
<p>Deng Tianmu Mountain</p>
<p>The image shows Chairman Shen and the reporter in front of the famous Big Tree King.</p>
<h3>Visiting Yuqian and Changhua on the Mountain Range</h3>
<p>From Lin'an, one can go to Eastern Tianmu Mountain, and the county government is preparing to develop Eastern Tianmu, so they are building a highway. According to locals, the fun places are still in Western Tianmu. According to historical records, Eastern Tianmu has scenic spots such as Daxian Peak, Erxian Peak, Huancui Peak, Baozhu Peak, General Peak, Elephant Nose Peak, Lion Peak, Wansong Cliff, Wangjiang Terrace, Guanyue Terrace, Tiaoyu Terrace, Rhinoceros Ridge, Longxu Ridge, Duobao Slope, Pinhu Stone, Waterfall Spring, Yujian Spring, Xixin Spring, Xianyan Spring, Liandan Pond, Fuyu Pond, Bailong Pond, Yinxiandong Cave, Ziyang Cave, Zhaoming Temple, Pingxi Nunnery, Qifeng Pavilion, and Guanpu Pavilion. However, it is feared that travel will be inconvenient due to the lack of a highway, so Western Tianmu is more famous than Eastern Tianmu.</p>
<p>We want to bypass Tianmu Mountain and first investigate two counties on the Tianmu Mountain range, and then go to Tianmu Mountain. So we still take a large truck forward. This section of the road is even more difficult to travel. Not only struggling through mud ditches, but also struggling on dirt without a road surface. When crossing streams, we have to wade through the water, and the car is shaking and groaning. I asked Mr. Tan Jiquan who was traveling with me: "Since the Ministry of Transportation has not paid attention to it for a long time, why don't the people come to repair it?" He told me: "If we make a big fuss, not only will it not be good, but the local people will also complain about being meddlesome." The fact is also the same, there must be a plan, but today this road is no longer a road. But it was once called the Hanghui Highway. I am really indignant when will it be repaired!</p>
<p>Arriving in Yuqian, we rested for a while and continued to move forward, wading through rapid shoals, and water splashed into the car. Really, our car has become an amphibious tank, which is really something unheard of.</p>
<h3>Seventy Thousand People, Thirty Thousand Pieces of Land</h3>
<p>Arriving in Changhua County, the county town was not destroyed, but it is extremely small. It is in western Zhejiang, adjacent to Anhui. There are often some bad people who come to harass here. Not long ago, some rogue hooligans, under the banner of the "×× Army," came to disrupt the peace. Later, the troops were sent away, and they fled to Anhui. This is an even more mountainous countryside, with more than 70,000 people, but only more than 30,000 pieces of land, each person can only be divided into more than five points of land. And more than 70,000 people need more than 300,000 dan of rice to live. In bumper years, the annual output is about 200,000 dan, which is still not enough. This year, late rice is suffering from rice stem borers, which can be said to be the most serious here. We look out over the fields, a yellow expanse of withered crops. This is indeed an important issue at present.</p>
<p>There are only two guaranteed households in Changhua City. Women usually weave cloth and also look after silkworm and tea trees, but this is not a major industry. The largest product is wood. Last year, wood sales were very good, with 3,000 to 4,000 taels sold. The so-called "taels" are the way of measuring wood. A ruler with degrees is used to measure the size of the wood, and taels and cents are used for calculation. At that time, the highest price per tael was more than 200,000 yuan, which is imaginable as a huge figure. But now it is not possible, sales are not good, and huge funds cannot be harvested, which means that Changhua has lost a fee for nourishing the local area.</p>
<p>On the way to Tianmu Mountain</p>
<p>The image shows a vehicle still having to wade through water after repairs.</p>
<p>Changhua is surrounded by mountains, and the mountains and forests are lush. There are many high mountains in the distance, which look like virgin forests. Some people say that it is not enough for Changhua to rely solely on the Hanghui Highway for transportation. It is best to use the Tianmu River to open up dangerous shoals and connect it to the Tonglu River to enter the Qiantang River. Then, the locally produced wood can be transported out by waterway. But he does not think that the reason is not because no one knows about Changhua's wood, but because of the unrest in the country, everyone is afraid to start construction.</p>
<p>Mountain walnuts are very famous, but they fail to bear fruit two out of every three years. This is the temperament of mountain walnuts. This year happens to be a year of failure, so how will they overcome this difficulty?</p>
<p>Because Changhua has many mountains, the mineral deposits are extremely rich. There are anthracite mines in Gushan, Zhamen Township, and there is also coal in Puchun Village, Shirui Township, and Qiankeng, Riliguan Township. The one in Zhamen Township has been open for two months. There are antimony mines in Siwu, Dongshanping, Jiakou Township, Zhongzhen Township, Wulong Town, and Qingshantan in the county. The one in Jiakou Township has also been open for two months. There are manganese mines in Xiejiacun, Zhamen Township, iron mines in Baizhangwu, Jiakou Township, and gold mines in Zhangjiawu, Renxi Township. Moreover, it is said that some people on the Anhui border have come to pan for gold sporadically.</p>
<p>Changhua County has so many mineral deposits, of course, it still needs experts to survey and explore them. But since Changhua has so many mountains, or maybe there are mines, we certainly hope that in the Zhejiang land where industry is hopeless, an unexpected industrial treasure will suddenly be discovered underground. Then the need for firewood and charcoal will be less, the trees can also be preserved, and there is no need to worry about the coal mines in Changxing, and our trains will not be afraid of running out of fuel.</p>
<p>With excited emotions, we returned to Yuqian along the uneven road from Changhua. Yuqian also experienced the enemy's fierce bombing. On the day after the Japanese enemy surrendered, the Japanese soldiers still came here lawlessly, robbing things and killing innocent people.</p>
<p>There is only one street here, which has now become a road. The houses are not very tidy. The population is 59,966 people, and the area is 212,304 square kilometers. The products include Atractylodes macrocephala, which is said to be able to cure all diseases. There are two types: wild and planted. The wild ones are not easy to find, and there are more planted ones. Most of the ones sold in the market are planted. The so-called wild ones are those produced in the mountains, said to be planted by immortals. In the past, the late Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government often needed this item.</p>
<p>Other products include silk, wood, dried bamboo shoots, Taohua paper, and tung oil, but these are not major products. This year, Yuqian is also experiencing an insect disaster, with rice stem borers spreading throughout the fields, making them difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Having visited Changhua and Yuqian counties, I also feel that the economic foundation is not very stable. It is truly a time of dangerous situations.</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Yuqian, we looked at the peak of Tianmu Mountain again, seeing how majestic and steep it is. I think the economic foundation of these four counties in western Zhejiang will not just decline. It is said that Shen Honglie is already raising funds for them, and I cannot help but wish the future of western Zhejiang well!</p>

<h3>Answering Readers - Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Wang Younian asked: When I was young, I fell down the stairs, which caused my nostrils to bleed frequently. The nosebleeds stopped after I was in my teens, but I had a lot of nasal mucus, which was yellowish-green and smelled fishy. It has not improved at all, and I often feel dizzy. I have consulted with ear, nose, and throat specialists and used washing devices for a long time, but it has been ineffective and very painful. I would like to ask if this disease can be cured and please indicate the treatment method.</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] I am afraid it is chronic rhinitis. It needs to be washed with disinfectant water and Ephedrin or drena-line should be applied to the nasal membrane. The root treatment method is surgery or electrotherapy.</p>
<p>(2) Feng Sensen asked: My daughter is five years old. In mid-May of the lunar calendar last year, she suffered from infantile convulsion, which healed in a few days. However, after healing, she could not walk with both feet, could not speak, and could not hear. It was not until the spring of this year that both feet were able to walk and play, lively and clever, as before. However, she still cannot hear or speak, and all her actions are similar to those of a deaf person. I do not know if she can recover. Please answer in detail: (1) Now that both feet can walk and jump, why can she still not hear or speak? (2) Can this disease be cured and how to treat it?</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] Your daughter's infantile convulsion may be encephalitis or infantile paralysis. It must be examined in detail before a diagnosis can be made. It is best to have a pediatric specialist in a nearby municipal hospital diagnose it.</p>
<p>(3) Huang Yongping asked: Two months ago, I was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis after an X-ray examination. At that time, a pulmonologist diagnosed and prescribed medicine, and then I went to the countryside for recuperation. For three months now, I have become emaciated and feel tired all over, but my diet has not decreased, and I am confident that there is no major problem. However, the family is not very harmonious and I am not in a good mood. I would like to ask if pulmonary tuberculosis must go through the process of coughing up blood? I have not coughed up blood. How should pulmonary tuberculosis be treated? Can I continue to work? What are the obstacles to my body? Please answer.</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers:] Please immediately use X-ray photography to diagnose whether there are cavities. If there are, you must perform artificial pneumothorax surgery, inject glucose calcium, and vitamin C. There is hope for recovery, so do not be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Inquiring About the Whereabouts of Ge Qiyang</p>
<p>Editor: I deeply admire your newspaper's social services column for solving difficult problems for readers every day. My brother, Ge Qiyang, graduated from the Graduate School of Yenching University in Peiping. In 1937, he was introduced by President Stuart Lei Deng from Peiping to Shanghai to serve as a history and geography professor at the University of Chicago in the United States. He corresponded several times within a year after he left, but communication was interrupted after the start of the Pacific War. There has been no news since the victory, and I am very surprised! I don't know where he is now? Now that Dr. Stuart has been appointed as the Ambassador to China, I have known him since I was a child, but because of the mountains and rivers separating us, I originally intended to go to pay my respects, but I am afraid it is inconvenient. I hope you can help solve the problem, I am very grateful. Sincerely, respectfully, Ge Qizhen (Correspondence address: No. 1, Jiandeli, Beicangmen, Wuxi)</p>
<p>[Editor's reply] This matter is very simple. You can send a letter directly to Ambassador Stuart at the American Embassy in Nanjing to inquire. You should be able to find out the exact news about your brother.</p>
<p>Answering an Inquiry About Land Location</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Liu Feng's article "Inquiring about the Location of Land" in the Social Services column of your newspaper on August 10. After checking the land deed, the land is located in the 16th map of the 4th district of the 21st security of Shanghai County and still belongs to the scope of Shanghai County. It is in Chenxing District, Pudong (i.e., Chenjiahang, south near the boundary of Nanhui County, which is a temporarily delayed receiving area in this city and is not under the management of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau). According to the word 圩. Number (the same number is not one piece) on the order, single households and certificates of payment of land tax (i.e., the relationship between the commonly known grain skewers and the land list), you can apply to the Shanghai County Government to order the map land to check the location of the land and all the people who have been mortgaged. This is to the Social Services Column, Wang Bingzhong, August 11 (living at No. 20, Lane 65, Gujianong, East Beijing Road, Beijing)</p>

<p>Hygiene and Medicine</p>
<h3>Obstacles to the Public Medical System</h3>
<p>— Jia Kui</p>
<p>For the past twenty years, there have been calls from all levels of Chinese society, from the court to the common people, to advocate for a public medical system. The short-lived Ministry of Health and its successor, the Department of Health, have both regarded the implementation of a public medical system as the cornerstone of central health administration. This is because China has a vast territory and a large population, with over 80% of its people being farmers. Their living standards and knowledge of hygiene are very low. Most rural areas have almost no medical facilities. Even Beijing, which has the reputation of a "city of culture," has a deplorable medical situation. According to pre-war statistics, 35% of the city's deaths occurred without any medical diagnosis. If Beijing is like this, the situation in the whole country can be imagined. Therefore, insightful people believe that the only good solution to China's medical problems is the nationalization of medicine—the implementation of a public medical system. However, after twenty years of promotion, although there have been some superficial achievements, there has been a lack of real results. This is due to numerous obstacles. If these obstacles are not thoroughly removed and the path paved, the future of the public medical system is difficult to be optimistic about. If we continue to procrastinate as before, we will not only miss the opportunity but also mislead the country and the nation. This is what those who care about themselves should avoid. Feeling a sense of crisis, I respectfully express my humble opinions.</p>
<p>Private Medical Practice</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to the public medical system is the current system of private medical practice. Public and private are as incompatible as water and fire. In the current state of health administration agencies and social organizations having no restrictions on private medical practice, while at the same time promoting a public medical system in empty words, is extremely ridiculous. Its lack of success is a natural result. Speakers often argue that public and private medicine coexist in advanced European and American countries. This is a superficial view of those who only know the foreign surface, cutting the feet to fit the shoes, ignoring the national conditions, and must be refuted.</p>
<p>European and American Habits</p>
<p>The private practice system in European and American countries has a long history. Tracing its origins, it is actually a legacy of their capitalism. During the heyday of Greece, medicine had already broken away from theocracy and superstition and entered the realm of science. Medical practitioners regarded saving people as their duty. In the Hippocratic Oath, he repeatedly warned against profiting from medicine. Today, our medical community respects Hippocrates, not only because of his superior intelligence, but also because of his noble character, which can be a model. Therefore, medicine is a science, a learning that should be used to save lives and strengthen the people. Medical practitioners can take it as a job, but not as a business. Therefore, doctors should not be listed as one of the free professions. Unfortunately, at the beginning of accepting Western medicine, our country blindly imitated; the actual effect of strengthening the people was not achieved, and the opportunity for profit was opened; taking its shortcomings instead of its strengths; resulting in today's strange phenomenon in China's medical community, which is truly sad.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine</p>
<p>Looking at our country's old doctors, they originally did not charge patients fees, but were hired by pharmacy operators, called "sitting hall doctors" (north of the Yellow River, in Hebei and Shandong provinces), and provided with food and lodging. They were also given an annual engagement gift and a bonus at the end of the year. Patients who asked for a doctor did not usually pay, but purchased medicine from the pharmacy. Therefore, the pharmacy was the one who had a direct business relationship with the patient, not the doctor. The idea was to maintain the doctor's nobility and dignity. This system was very good. In the late Qing Dynasty, this style still existed. Today's old doctors all charge registration fees and consultation fees, so that the former honest style has flowed into commercial malpractices, and they are also poisoned by Western capitalism. Business is becoming more and more prosperous, and medical ethics are declining. How regrettable it is! However, the wrong path is not far, and turning back is the shore. How to eliminate this bad habit and restore the dignity of the past? The virtuous of the medical community, the ruling authorities, should rise up and plan for it.</p>
<p>Since the European Renaissance, capitalism developed first, and scientific medicine revived later. The establishment of public health has only a few decades of history, and the advocacy of the public medical system is even a more recent new facility. Private medical practice has been around since ancient times. Deep-rooted, reform is difficult. However, the medical associations in those countries are well-organized. Where the rule of law does not reach, medical groups often impose sanctions themselves, and the level of medical ethics is quite high. Therefore, medical practitioners must also pay attention to science and have less fraud. Moreover, they are able to assist and serve in public welfare undertakings. Secondly, there are many doctors, and the ratio of doctors to the population is also more reasonable. Although practicing doctors also gather in big cities, there are still many people who are willing to take public office. Although the remuneration of public doctors is usually not as rich as the income of practicing doctors, there is no feeling of a lack of talent. This is very different from the situation in our country.</p>
<p>Qualified Doctors</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there are only more than 10,000 qualified doctors in our country today, which is less than one-tenth of the national needs. At present, there are less than 20 medical schools in our country. Each school graduates an average of less than 30 students per year. Assuming that the number of medical schools doubles in the short term, and each school recruits double classes. Without even asking whether there is a source of students, in twenty years, only 50,000 qualified doctors can be trained. The training capacity is almost saturated, but compared with the national needs, it is far from enough. Then, is it not very difficult to promote a public medical system that builds the country and strengthens the people? The lack of talent is a major obstacle to our country's public medical system. How to intensify training is an important solution, and it is imperative to immediately prohibit the private medical practice system. One is to promote the existing medical personnel to fully serve the public, and the other is to restrain the future medical personnel from flowing into business, so that the country can train a talent and have one more person to serve. In fact, a country as poor and weak as ours must catch up quickly and catch up to gain a foothold. If we must follow in the footsteps of others and let it evolve naturally, the car in front has overturned, and the latter will follow, how stupid is it?</p>
<p>Serve the Public</p>
<p>Some say that although the history of private medical practice in our country is short, the accumulated habits are deep. Moreover, where there is profit, people tend to flock to it. Once prohibited, the response will be great. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the medical community has not yet been mobilized, which can be a lesson. Moreover, with the size of China and the number of people, the government uses limited talents to shoulder the medical affairs of the whole people, which is beyond its capacity. This also seems right, but it is not. The public medical facilities are to popularize medicine throughout the country, promote the health of the nation, and reduce the country's deaths, so as to achieve the effect of strengthening the people and strengthening the country. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor will be happy to follow. The medical community is an intellectual group, how can it be an exception? Since the Anti-Japanese War, national mobilization has only reached a one-sided aspect, and has not yet reached the whole. The medical community is also the same. Those who are conscripted are only the newly graduated medical students every year. Private medical practitioners are not lacking in enthusiastic patriots, but there are many who sigh that there is no way to serve the country. When the mobilization law for health personnel came out, it only stipulated that one person should be conscripted for every dozens of people, but in fact, it was just a formality and has not been universally implemented. Therefore, the reason why the medical community failed to be fully mobilized during the Anti-Japanese War is one of the examples of the failure of mobilization in all sectors of the country. It is not that the medical community is unwilling to serve the public. The great cause of building the country, the people of the country all have a share, why should the ruling authorities make the medical personnel sigh again? Clearly prohibit private medical practice and fully serve the public, this is the time.</p>
<p>As for saying that China is vast and has a large population. The government cannot afford the medical affairs of the whole people for a while. This is not a reason to preserve private medicine, but a reason why our country urgently needs to implement a public medical system. The current phenomenon in our country is that the land is vast and the population is large, but there are not enough doctors. These few doctors are almost all gathered in big cities, forming a deformed development, so that rural farmers have no medical facilities. There is no doctor within thousands of miles in the interior. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were only six doctors in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. The people's illnesses are all entrusted to superstition and magic, let alone health care. To correct this kind of deformity, there is no good way except to use political power to promote the public medical system. That is, use the existing talents and do everything possible to gradually advance. It can be expected that it will not be difficult to succeed within thirty years. Speaking of cooperating with the construction of the country, the period of thirty years is too long. If we don't come up with this plan again and let it evolve naturally, then the long night will be endless.</p>
<p>Strengthening the People is Paramount</p>
<p>Revoking the private medical practice system is certainly not without difficulties. However, if we can recognize that building the country comes first and strengthening the people is paramount, then all difficulties can be solved easily. Increasing the treatment of public doctors and enriching medical equipment should be prerequisites. If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools, and so is the doctor. Therefore, whether it is a county or city hospital, or a health center, the medical equipment must meet the standards. The location distribution of domestic medical schools must also take into account the situation of the provinces and regions, and closely cooperate with the public medical structure to improve its academic atmosphere. Public medical personnel should also have opportunities for further study after a considerable period of work, so that their knowledge and skills can keep pace with the times. As for the treatment, it seems to be a trivial matter. Among the doctors who earn tens of millions of yuan a month, there are only one or two out of a hundred. On average, they are well-fed and clothed, and not in poverty. However, it is also pitiful to be busy all day long, acting like slaves. If we can give them a fair treatment based on the price index in various places. In addition to food, clothing, and education for children, there should also be some savings for emergencies. Increase or decrease the salary according to the relationship between seniority and actual position to seek fairness. If life can be stabilized and work can be guaranteed, most practicing doctors will be happy to abandon their private interests and serve the public. During the Anti-Japanese War, civil servants lacked food and clothing, so those with weak will changed careers, which was a special phenomenon. However, the treatment of public doctors in the future should be better than that of general civil servants. One is because the responsibilities are heavier, and the other is because of the lack of talent. Compared with bank clerks who only handle money and get thick rewards, they cannot be treated the same. What is even more important is that the production and sale of medicines must be nationalized. This can not only reduce waste, but also restrain consumption. Every year, hundreds of millions of yuan of unnecessary losses can be saved. With our country's poverty and the people's suffering, we not only do not deserve to have luxury private doctors, but also should not have wasteful secret medicines. With the nationalization of the pharmaceutical industry, the trend of competing for secret medicines will be fundamentally eliminated. All medical personnel use the same medicines and follow the same procedures, then the division of the domestic medical community into British, American, German, and Japanese factions can be eliminated. Killing multiple birds with one stone, why not do it? However, in the past, the monopoly system focused on tax revenue. The monopoly of medicines should be based on control as the principle and supply as the goal. We must aim to achieve the enjoyment of medical and health care, regardless of wealth or poverty, is equal as the ultimate goal. Public health and medical institutions should be universally supplied. The patient's prescription is limited to being signed by a public doctor. Then private practitioners have no medicine to sell, and patients who go to private doctors have no difficulty buying it. The trend of business can be quickly reduced, what is difficult? It all depends on whether we have the courage to do it!</p>
<h3>The Relationship between Mental and Physical Health</h3>
<p>— Liu Yuzi</p>
<p>The relationship between the mind and the body is very close. The former is invisible and intangible, unable to be heard or seen, while the latter is tangible and visible. The close relationship between the mind and the body is like a machine and the electricity that drives it. The machine is tangible, while the movement of electricity is intangible. For example, if a factory only has machines but no electricity, the machines will not run smoothly, which will affect the entire factory's inability to start work, just like a person who has had a mental illness. Although his body's organizational structure is normal, he cannot work. Conversely, if there is good electricity but the machine malfunctions, it is like a person's mental state is good, but his body is too weak and sick. The machine is damaged and needs to be repaired, so the electricity is good but useless. Therefore, the factory must also temporarily stop work. Therefore, a person's overall health is obtained from both mental and physical aspects. A perfect body is like a complete machine, and a good spirit is like full power. Both are beautiful, and the entire factory can start work, and the products can be excellent. Because the spirit and the body are complementary to each other, a sound mind must reside in a sound body. As the saying goes, "A broad mind makes the body feel at ease," and "A solemn mind makes the body feel comfortable, and a solemn mind makes the appearance respectful," all refer to the close relationship between the mind and the body.</p>
<p>There are many examples of the relationship between mind and body in daily life. Taking the example of a cat seeing a dog, in addition to terror, its hair stands on end. This is because its fear psychology occurs first, and then the physiological changes follow. For example, when people are shy, their faces turn red, and when they are frightened, their faces turn white. After hearing ghost stories, the hair on the body cannot help but stand on end. The body develops high fever and chills, which easily leads to bad temper. Furthermore, if the mood is not good, the appetite is immediately reduced, and the appearance is haggard. All these are proofs that the changes in the mind and body are closely related.</p>
<p>Therefore, to seek a complete and perfect individual, it includes both a healthy body and mind. Because if one aspect has defects, it will definitely affect the other aspect as well. Let's take the most common "neurasthenia" as an example. Its symptoms include insomnia, constipation, headaches, weight loss, poor appetite, etc. From the surface, those symptoms seem to be the result of physiological changes, but in fact, after tracing the source and carefully studying the results, it can be proved that those are abnormal psychological effects.</p>
<p>Because from the beginning, we only instilled common sense of physiological hygiene in our minds, so when we get sick, we only want to seek a basis from the physiological aspect. The psychological aspect seems to have never been noticed. It is like when a light bulb suddenly goes out, we only think that the light bulb itself is damaged. In fact, we ignore the reason why the power plant stopped supplying electricity. Therefore, when we check that the light bulb is indeed intact, we should immediately think that perhaps there is no electricity. It is the same as when we examine a patient and cannot find any problems, we should immediately think that it is his psychological effect.</p>
<p>In short, environmental cleanliness, food nutrition, prevention of infectious diseases, and the importance of DDT insecticide are all things that we should pay attention to in physiological hygiene. On the other hand, instilling common sense of mental hygiene, finding the origin of psychological conflicts, understanding ourselves, and recognizing personality are all medicines to promote psychological health. At the same time, we must also keep in mind the relationship between the mind and the body. Therefore, the purpose of "hygiene and medicine" is to promote the health of our mind and body.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Malaria</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xueli</p>
<p>The symptoms of malaria vary depending on the type of malaria parasite, and also depending on the type of onset, the patient's resistance, age, and acute or chronic stage. Mild cases are the common symptoms seen by the public: initially chills, followed by fever, and finally sweating, and then the temperature subsides. Severe cases are dangerous, called malignant malaria, the patient often has a persistent high fever, is unconscious, or has severe abdominal pain, or vomits incessantly, and even dies. Fortunately, the former is the majority in the coastal provinces, and the latter is less. However, malignant malaria is very prevalent in the southwestern provinces of China, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi. In the past, the medical style was not prosperous? The pathogen is unknown, and it is commonly called "miasma." Most of these "miasmas" are contracted by people from other provinces who have just entered the area. Although scholars also suffer from it, it is not as fierce as those from outside. In the past, officials and merchants who were demoted or traveled often mistakenly believed that it was acclimatization, or even ghosts and gods who were causing trouble, suffered from this miasma, and suffered unexpectedly. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Yunnan-Burma Road was the lifeline of transportation for China's rear, and countless staff along the road were affected by it. The cities of Sifang, Bamo, and Tengchong, which border Yunnan and Burma, have reduced their population and declined in commerce due to the miasma, and the people mostly suffer from anemia, splenomegaly, and incomplete development, which is caused by chronic malaria. The author witnessed the heartache and bribed the summary of the symptoms of malaria to inform the people of the introduction of medical common sense.</p>
<p>Malaria is not only a human disease, but other animals such as chickens and monkeys also have it. Here, we will only limit ourselves to malaria in humans. The most important human malaria can be divided into three types: (1) Tertian malaria, (2) Quartan malaria, (3) Malignant malaria.</p>
<p>These three types of malaria are diseases caused by three types of "malaria parasites." Due to the different types of insects and their different life histories, they also differ in their symptoms. However, regardless of the type of malaria, they all have the following similar characteristics.</p>
<p>(1) Periodicity: That is, each type of acute malaria has chills, fever, sweating, and fever subsided. This is a cycle. Tertian malaria has a cycle every other day, and quartan malaria occurs once every two days. Malignant malaria, the life history of the parasite can vary from 24 hours to 48 hours, so it is less regular. Daily attacks or intermittent attacks are all possible. The duration of chills is generally an average of several tens of minutes to one or two hours. At the time of onset, the patient initially feels tired, limbs are sore, mental fatigue, headache, and drowsy, afraid of breeze, like to enter hot soup, the side of the oven, and even covered with several quilts, still can not resist the cold feeling, followed by trembling occurs, teeth chattering, clattering. At this time, the patient's face is pale, the appearance is haggard, and the nails are purplish brown. The epidermis often shows goosebumps, and the skin temperature decreases, but the body temperature has increased. Then the temperature rises to about 40 degrees Celsius, then the skin color changes from pale to red, and the skin temperature also increases. Headaches often increase, and even often present neurological symptoms and digestive symptoms. The pulse then turns from weak to strong. This is maintained for three or four hours to more than ten hours, and then the temperature drops sharply, accompanied by profuse sweating. Those with weak bodies can not support the profuse sweating. Patients often feel thirsty, and the symptoms of dehydration are also common. Those who have malaria for the first time are mostly cured after the fever subsides, and can get out of bed, except for weakness, there is no other suffering.</p>
<p>(2) Paroxysmal: If it is tertian malaria, it mostly does not have fever on the second day, and the fever recurs on the third day, reproducing the symptoms described in the previous section, cycle after cycle. If not treated with medicine, it can occur paroxysmally about ten times, lasting for two or three weeks, until the patient's natural resistance gradually produces and naturally stops. Quartan malaria is more stubborn, and it is not easy to control the attack on the fourth day. Malignant malaria also has this paroxysmal nature, but its periodicity is not very obvious. This should also have a trend of natural control, and it also takes two or three weeks.</p>
<p>(3) Recurrence: If the patient in the acute phase is not treated, or is not properly treated, they will enter the chronic phase from this acute phase. The characteristic of this period is repeated recurrence. Most patients with chronic malaria often recur after labor or accidental exposure to wind and cold, or after surgery for other diseases, when their natural resistance is weaker. At this time, patients mostly present with symptoms of anemia, such as palpitations, dizziness, vertigo, easy fatigue, mental depression, indigestion, and even edema, shortness of breath, etc. If a physical test is done, these patients often appear emaciated, children's development is stunted, the face is pale, the whites of the eyes are jaundice, the spleen is enlarged and firm, and the liver is also larger. Patients with severe anemia have heart enlargement and systolic murmurs. In addition, there is pleural effusion, ascites, and systemic edema. Generally speaking, quartan malaria has the most obvious recurrence, which can last for two or three years; tertian malaria is second; the recurrence period of malignant malaria is about one year. If treated with quinine or atabrine, malignant malaria and quartan malaria are easier to control with drugs, and tertian malaria also responds after medication, but it is still easy to relapse after recovery.</p>
<p>As for the symptoms of malignant malaria, in addition to the above, there are many variations. It is difficult to predict whether it will occur once a day or every other day, and there are many fierce types of attacks. It can resemble a variety of non-malarial diseases and common diseases, and doctors often feel thorny in the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Malignant malaria has an uncertain fever type, and does not necessarily have a cycle. If the onset is slower, the fever persists, and it is very similar to typhoid fever. Or the onset is sudden and rapid, the fever is persistent, the whole body aches, the face is red, and the conjunctiva is congested, which can resemble the initial spotted typhus or relapsing fever without spots. Or the body temperature rises and falls sharply and uncertainly in one day, then it can be misdiagnosed as kala-azar. Or with severe abdominal pain, abdominal muscle stiffness and tension, it can be misdiagnosed as appendicitis or other intra-abdominal surgical diseases and surgery is performed. Sometimes the patient has abdominal pain and diarrhea, and the stool contains blood and mucus, which is very similar to dysentery. Or it presents with deep jaundice and incessant vomiting, which is very similar to cholecystitis, cholangitis, and hepatitis. Or it is coma, convulsions, delirium, and dementia, which is very similar to encephalitis. Or it presents with symptoms of meningeal irritation, which is similar to meningitis. Or with mental disorder and nonsense, it is mistaken for neurological patients. Or the edema is severe, the urine is reduced, and it contains red and white blood cells, which is very similar to nephritis. There are also patients with urticaria. All of these are special manifestations of malignant malaria. Therefore, the diagnosis of malaria depends entirely on the symptoms, which are often prone to error. It is necessary to repeatedly check blood smears in order to be sure.</p>

<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Liu Si's Illusions</h3>
<p>— Chen Lun</p>
<p>In a desolate valley, a new railway stretches forward, winding around mountains and rivers, like a living giant python crawling towards a place unseen by the human eye.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a heavy stroke of the "Develop the Northwest" paintbrush, a great, magnificent, solemn, and powerful stroke dipped in the blood and sweat of many living and dead.</p>
<p>Beneath each sleeper of this new road, it seems, there is a soul supporting it. Leaving this memorable mark is truly not easy!</p>
<p>Because it is a new road, accidents often occur. Derailments, landslides, crashes, people being crushed to death… these are common occurrences.</p>
<p>Like a parasite, Liu Si attached himself to the "track maintenance crew" along the edge of this road to earn a living. But Liu Si's task is precisely the opposite of that of a parasite, because he is the true "young nanny" who maintains and repairs this road.</p>
<p>Liu Si is a homeless Henan native from the Huangfan district. Actually, who doesn't have a home? It's not like Liu Si sprang from a mountain crevice. However, according to Liu Si, his home was washed away by the Yellow River in a twilight. Although this is a great sorrow, even now, when he brings up his family, Liu Si becomes sad for a long time. But this gave Liu Si a carefree life. Otherwise, who would carry a head on two shoulders and wander into this desolate valley? If he hadn't come here, how could this great work of "developing the Northwest" have fallen upon his own head? To be honest, losing his home naturally gave Liu Si a good opportunity to move up.</p>
<p>Liu Si is content with his work. Every day he follows the foreman along the roadbed to inspect it. They carry iron pots, shovels, picks, large crowbars, track gauges… carefully searching for any non-standard defects in each section of the roadbed, each sleeper, each rail, and each small part: like a bowl repairer carefully searching for the lost spare drill in a pile of dirt in front of him, they patiently rack their brains to find every small defect, so that every non-standard place can be modified, and tens of thousands of passengers can have their lives secured. But despite Liu Si and his colleagues getting up early and going to bed late, and pouring all their efforts onto these parallel rails, accidents still frequently occur, and they have fallen into a deep web of melancholy.</p>
<p>This day, as the bronze-colored sunset slipped behind the ridge of the western mountains, Liu Si followed his colleagues, dragging their melancholic and heavy steps, to knock off work. The work exhausted them, and they slowly lumbered back to their temporary home like old oxen, ringing the dull copper bell to send off the evening. After dinner, Liu Si pulled out a tattered bamboo mat and lay under a tree in front of the track maintenance hut, lost in thought. He meditated carefully, like corrupt and fraudulent officials lying by the lamplight in a dark room, thinking about ways to fleece the people. Liu Si narrowed his eyes and used all his brainpower to think about measures to ensure traffic safety.</p>
<p>The evening breeze, like the soft and tender fingers of a young lover in Zhang Ziping's novels, caressed Liu Si's chest, but Liu Si had never had such a "romance," nor did he think about that. However, the fatigue of the day, the invisible rope that bound him, was blown apart inch by inch by the evening breeze, leaving him feeling comfortable and refreshed.</p>
<p>As the sound of snoring arose from his companions around him, Liu Si vaguely heard faint voices speaking not far away. Although the voices were not loud, there were sighs, frustrated breast-beating, fierce rebuttals, and even threatening speeches in the voices; like listening to Peking opera on a crystal radio, although the sound was small, it was complete with all the roles of male, female, painted-face, and old male performers. He couldn't help but feel strange. He pricked up his ears to listen carefully, as if someone was holding a meeting and reviewing something. He felt even stranger, so he drifted up and hid behind a large locust tree, wanting to see clearly and hear the whole story. Before he could stand steady, he saw at a glance a large group of material spirits arguing fiercely about something. At this time, the locomotive boss, with eyes like a poisonous dragon, screamed a few times and already left the meeting. The lonely track spike boy, still staring with a pair of small black bean eyes, fixedly stared in the direction the locomotive left. He said to everyone in frustration:</p>
<p>"How many times has the boss looked at me with arrogant and contemptuous eyes, thinking that I am an insignificant character that can only be seen under a microscope, not worth a penny. Sometimes he even scolds me emptily, and even roars at me from time to time: saying that I am a useless rice bucket, saying that I am the number one piece of garbage in the world. Who knew that the other day, our track spike partners, because of a moment of pique and a slight slack, he derailed and went astray. This is truly self-inflicted! Let's say, for example: even if we are rice buckets, we can still hold rice for everyone to eat, and serve everyone. Compared to those heroes who step on people's heads and shout for society and for humanity, we feel much more at ease, right? Although our track spike partners are all born with congenital deficiencies and acquired imbalances, and are born with a pitiful appearance that is thin and dark, we can sell a foolish strength and have backbone, which is much stronger than those big-bellied and hard-skinned bloodsuckers, right? The derailment of this locomotive is a severe punishment for him. If he is still obsessed, then we have to all change our careers and make other plans."</p>
<p>"Hehe! That's how trains derail. I need to pay special attention to this at work," Liu Si thought to himself while eavesdropping, working on his mental calculations.</p>
<p>Next, the steel rail Mr., whose face was pale from being crushed, made a big fuss:</p>
<p>"Hey, you are still being persecuted indirectly, but only I am directly enduring his torture. Every day, he strides across my back with an air of arrogance, chest out. Come and see, the black skin on my back is peeling off layer by layer, and that kind of pain is truly unbearable…" As he spoke, he opened his arms and turned sideways to show everyone his wounds, implying endless feelings of sorrow. He took a breath and continued: "…Not only does he not give me a bit of comfort, but he often yells and scolds; and our buddies on the curves are even more miserable. Every time he passes there, he presses them so hard that they squeak and screech like the sound of grinding teeth. How can we live through this dark and hopeless life? So, the other day, when the track spike boys relaxed a little, we took the opportunity to spread out and rest our legs. So the locomotive, which looked so majestic and like a temple utensil, derailed. This is truly unavoidable, and as far as I'm concerned, it's well-deserved."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes! It's really well-deserved!" Many material spirits echoed in unison.</p>
<p>Later, the sleepy old Mr. Sleeper also reported the tragedy of his companions, saying that the sacrifice of his partners was truly an unexplained death, a truly meaningless sacrifice. They hadn't committed any major mistakes. Why, when the locomotive got angry, did it pour down piles of slag and poisonous fire and use cruel fire torture on them? Should there be such a penalty in the world? In the 20th century now, this is very unreasonable. Finally, he asked everyone to avenge those of his partners who were burned with scorched heads and broken backs and arms, and vowed to provide support, notifying the locomotive that the same thing should not happen again, and devising a way to inform the station to set up an ash pit to maintain the permanent peace of the material spirit world. After speaking, he wiped the sweat from the tip of his nose and sighed softly for a while. Everyone, of course, echoed in unison and agreed.</p>
<p>At this time, the Miss Track Plate, whose face was blue with anger and pale, because she was shy and kind and didn't want to show off in front of people, didn't express any opinions, just hid under the sleepers and cursed softly on both sides; finally, the fishplate bosses, thick as palms, and the screw and bolt sisters also expressed their respective opinions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the locomotive's fascist behavior should be overthrown.</p>
<p>"Hehe!" Liu Si laughed secretly in the dark, laughing at this group of foolish material spirits for being too stupid and ridiculous. He thought in his heart: "This is our human affair, how can you blame the locomotive?" He was thinking about something when suddenly someone was talking again. He looked up and saw that it was Mr. Steel Rail who was making a conclusion:</p>
<p>"Everyone!" Mr. Steel Rail stopped briefly after calling out "Everyone," seeming to want to attract everyone's attention, and then continued: "Based on the reports everyone just made, we can say this: every material spirit, like a person, if you want to do something, you can't do it by relying solely on your own abilities. For example, let's compare it to a human body. It's not enough for a person to just grow a head. Once you have a head, you also have to grow eyes, otherwise, living blindly is so painful. With eyes, you also have to grow a nose to specialize in breathing. If you only breathe, you can't get enough nutrition, you also have to grow a mouth to eat things. After eating things, you have to digest, absorb, and excrete, so the five internal organs are indispensable. Without limbs, of course, it won't work, but the human body is composed of countless tiny cells that are invisible to the human eye. If there are no cells, the human body can't be organized at all, so how can you ignore them? Everything is coordinated with division of labor and cooperation, and you can't despise or ignore every small organ, small joint, and small part. Not only that, but you also have to carefully maintain them and nurture them in order to unleash great power. The same principle can be extended to a group, a society, and so on. If you understand this, you will be safe and sound, otherwise you will be confronted everywhere. The recent train derailment was because of the arrogant locomotive…" Mr. Steel Rail spoke to this point in one breath, and he was so excited that he couldn't stand it. Suddenly, he heard the sound of "kongtong kongtong" coming from far to near. He looked up and saw the locomotive, with its huge eyes like two poisonous dragons, gradually galloping towards him. He couldn't help but panic a little. He waved to everyone, as if telling the material spirits, "That hateful thing is coming at us again, let's temporarily hide for a while and then talk!" He left without speaking. The material spirits were all ridiculing his timidity. Liu Si also hid behind the tree, echoing his laughter. Just then, the train had reached the front, and it seemed to have derailed again. Because the train was going downhill at this time, it couldn't stop for a while, and it crashed straight into the tree where Liu Si was hiding. Liu Si wanted to run away, but it was too late. He suddenly felt a jolt and escaped from the dream with a palpitating heart.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, calmed his heart, and looked at the distant sky. It was just the dawn of the morning. The morning breeze was blowing gently, and his companions were still snoring sweetly. He opened the door of memory and let the rope of thought tie back everything in the dream. He couldn't help but smile: "Strange! How could I have such an unimaginable strange dream last night?" He reviewed the scenes in the dream one by one. He sympathized with them, pitied them. But he also felt that this was an absurd and nonsensical strange thing.</p>
<p>"Do some materials have souls?" He asked himself.</p>
<p>At breakfast, they set off to work again. On the way, Liu Si told everyone about his strange dream last night and asked them to pay special attention to the looseness and instability of the track spikes, because in a section, if there are several loose track spikes, it can easily cause derailment, which is something that cannot be ignored. They worked very enthusiastically today as usual. The three express trains in the morning passed this section very safely.</p>
<p>At noon, they were paid. After doing the calculations, each person received a salary of 23,000 yuan. After deducting 14,000 yuan for food and zero expenses, each person only received two or three thousand yuan. So, issues such as clothing, eating, supporting a family, and making a living… all flooded into their minds. The enthusiastic and tense work mood in the morning was squeezed out by the torrent of life and turned into nothing. Each of them held two new banknotes, looked miserable, shook the banknotes with a rustling sound, and muttered:</p>
<p>"What's going on? What's going on? This life is killing us!"</p>
<p>Someone joked to Liu Si:</p>
<p>"Liu Si! We are also 'rice buckets' of the track spike class that can only be seen under a microscope. We care about the railway every day, and even plan maintenance and repair work in our dreams, striving to ensure the safety of the lives of tens of thousands of passengers. If the railway is damaged, we care about maintenance, repair, and improvement, but what about our lives… alas, who cares about us?"</p>
<p>"Uh, uh!" Liu Si stared and couldn't answer a word.</p>
<h3>Zheng Manqing's Flowers</h3>
<h3>Sounds of Annoyance</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>I often ask my friends, why is my surroundings filled with sounds of annoyance all day long?</p>
<p>As soon as I open my eyes in the morning, a string of piercing "Mommy, Mommy" flies over. It's a sick little girl from the neighbor's house. Her grandfather died, her mother followed someone else, and she's left with a sixty-year-old blind grandmother. In the morning, the blind old woman gropes to the stove to cook bran porridge, and the child curls up on a tattered mat, calling out "Mommy" miserably.</p>
<p>The sun rises high, and the clock in the living room strikes nine. Not early, not late, a beggar with a broken leg will crawl past my window, knocking his head with a thud and crying out loudly, "Madam! …Miss… Save the poor! …Starving to death!…"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the faint sunlight shines into my room, and Sister Zhang from across the street comes as usual, with her withered yellow face and a handful of tears and snot, nagging me over and over again, "Miss, there's no hope for his illness anymore! …No fields, no property, six children left behind, how am I going to live!…"</p>
<p>At dusk, in the quiet small room, Old Man Chen's white beard trembles under the lamplight. He sighs, "Alas! Life is impossible! …Living to be seventy years old and still having to be a beast of burden! …Alas! Even being a beast of burden isn't enough to eat your fill! Alas, alas!…"</p>
<p>Annoying! This "Mommy, Mommy," this "Madam, Miss," this "How am I going to live," this "Alas, alas,"…</p>
<p>From sunrise to sunset, my ears are filled with sounds of annoyance. I can't stand it, I'm begging my friend for help.</p>
<p>But my friend said that these sounds of annoyance are the flowers of life, decorating the monotonous world and enriching the souls of poets. Afraid that I wouldn't believe it, my friend made a metaphor, saying, "Don't you like to appreciate many moving and praiseworthy poems and essays? If there were no these sounds of annoyance, how could poets and writers write those moving and praiseworthy poems and essays?"</p>
<p>Is my friend's words right? I don't know. But from then on, although I am still afraid of these sounds of annoyance, I love to read all the moving and praiseworthy poems and essays even more, but not for "appreciation," but for "chewing."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, a Drop of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Although this place is small, it is quite important militarily. It is the throat of the Pinghan Railway, and a small railway connects to Fengtai. From Fengtai, one branch goes straight to Tong County, and the other goes through Zhoukou and directly to Tianjin. Lugou Bridge and Wanping are nearby. A little past the northwest is Mentougou, and it is only thirty miles away from Beiping. Not to mention trains and cars, even if you pick a good horse, it only takes a short time.</p>
<p>Our house is just west of the iron factory, separated by a small hillock. It used to be inhabited by an engineer, but he found it too secluded and moved into the factory. I went to school with this engineer for a year, so it was easy to rent it.</p>
<p>Once evening comes, it is as quiet as a tomb here. But sometimes it is also very noisy, with broadcasts, excerpts from plays, "Arise, arise, ye who refuse to be slaves," etc. But this is a fabricated noise, a trained noise; in other words, this noise is exactly the cover or disguise for our work.</p>
<p>After the lights come on, we don't need to make noise anymore. And in this tense moment, we are very unwilling to make noise.</p>
<p>Sure enough, just as Hejian Yu was pacing around the house, a faint cannon sound suddenly came. Hejian Yu stopped immediately. He had received rigorous training and was as alert as a police dog. In less than five seconds, there were two more sounds. An expert could tell that these were the sounds of Japanese small field guns.</p>
<p>As soon as Hejian heard the second cannon sound, he immediately ran to the door, lifted the curtain, made a gesture to the outside, glanced at me, strode to the head of the kang, opened the tree cabinet, reached out and pulled out a pair of headphones, put them on his head, and took out a small microphone, while turning on the machine button. His movements were so agile, his gestures so skilled and clean, and his expression so calm and composed that it was truly admirable.</p>
<p>"Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one… —Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one…" Although he was calling out numbers, he still maintained a beautiful Beijing accent.</p>
<p>The equipment installed in the cabinet is the latest German-style two-way wireless telephone, which can also receive broadcasts of various frequencies. The whole machine weighs only six or seven pounds, and when folded, the exterior is just a small handheld leather package.</p>
<p>"Number thirty-five… seven zero seven… one one… Hello… Uh… one six one… headquarters…" The phone was already connected.</p>
<p>At this time, the cannon fire was getting tighter and tighter, and occasionally a few sounds of machine guns and rifles could be heard.</p>
<p>After a while, Hejian finished the phone call, took off the headphones and microphone, closed the tree cabinet, and returned to sit opposite me. There was no trace of the tension just now. He knew that I was waiting for the news from his phone call.</p>
<p>"Old Yue," he opened his mouth and smiled slightly, as if unwilling to reveal the news: "Old Yue, you see how much of a bastard!"</p>
<p>I didn't quite understand who this "bastard" was referring to. In short, this news was absolutely unimportant, but 100% certain. Normally, there were four common languages between us: if the matter was important, we would use Japanese military jargon, short and clear. In our duties, we have always used our mixed language, interspersed with obscure language. I am not very familiar with the obscure language; this is his own ingenuity, using the most familiar classical or idioms in Japan, mixed in the communication language, the meaning is mostly the opposite of the original meaning. Ordinary people who heard it, although they understood it, only thought it was a trivial sentence. The third kind of language is used on formal occasions, that is, pure Tokyo language. When he is relaxed and happy, or when he needs a few witty remarks to embellish, he can also speak a authentic Northeastern dialect, or Beijing dialect. In addition, he can speak all the words of cursing and cursing people in various parts of China.</p>

<h3>Whispers Under the Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Listening to five or ten minutes of music is like taking a bath in a bathtub, but the latter washes the body, while the former washes the heart.</p>
<p>As for those low-level and vulgar music, they are only disgusting.</p>
<p>Schools are scarce, and entrance exams are even more difficult. The children of many friends are running around like ants on a hot pot these days. I remember that in the English test paper of a university in Shapingba, Chongqing, two years ago, there was a large candlestick, with four lines of poetry attached below, the words are as follows:</p>
<p>I have no such talent,</p>
<p>Others asked me to come;</p>
<p>Not a single word of English,</p>
<p>Draw a candlestick.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping stated: a qualified person said: taking the football game as an example, Marshal Ma and Situ, the two elders, are no longer referees, but have become footballs that are kicked around. Although the joint statement is not the sound of a bursting football bladder, it is at least an expression of impatience.</p>
<p>However, kicking around, one day it will be kicked into the goal. I wonder if the two elders can be patient for a little longer?</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's wife repeatedly applied for a retrial. This is called "treating a dead horse as if it were alive." It is actually uncomfortable to breathe two more breaths in the world.</p>
<p>The divorce case between Yang Xiuqiong and Tao Berlin has not yet been resolved. These two news—death and separation—people tend to associate together.</p>
<p>The film industry is unwilling to participate in the election of the queen;</p>
<p>The drama industry is also unwilling to participate in the election of the queen;</p>
<p>The Yue Opera industry is also the same;</p>
<p>Is it because there is no emperor?</p>
<p>Glass</p>
<h3>Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Youfu</p>
<p>"Glass reflects the heart of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people don't want to see through it!"</p>
<p>Glass penetrates Shanghai, glass sees through Shanghai. Every twist and turn in the guts of Shanghai people is clearly illuminated by the glass mirror.</p>
<p>Any company you go to invariably uses glass as its symbol. Glass products: raincoats, suspenders, belts, women's handbags, combs, shoes, socks, watch straps, mirrors, cigarette cases, cigarette holders, bedsheets, clothing materials, holsters, hot water bottles... What we see are glass items, and what men and women wear and use are glass items. In just a few months, Shanghai has become a flashy glass world.</p>
<p>These kinds of glass items are indeed often of good quality and reasonable price, but people who buy glass products don't do so entirely for good quality and low price. (In fact, many glass products are not cheap.) Their purpose: everyone is rushing to be modern, how can I be an exception? At the very least, I have to buy a glass belt to use, even if it's a Jewish product, as long as it looks like glass, otherwise, I really won't be content.</p>
<p>Using glass products is everyone's freedom, and I certainly don't dare to nitpick, but there are many, many people whose income is not sufficient, but they still insist on being modern and fighting for face, which is quite pitiful. And if they buy a glass belt but can't match it with other clothing, it's even more painful! To put it bluntly, those who don't need to use glass products force themselves to get something made of glass in order to chase after vanity. In fact, a person's beauty is not in their appearance; it includes physical health, a kind heart, and intellectual fulfillment. If you already have a good belt, why bother buying a glass belt just to keep up with fashion? In fact, to be frank, glass products are popular in Shanghai, but they are already the most outdated in America. Glass reflects the heart of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people ultimately don't want to see through it!</p>
<p>Recently, it's said that America has produced the first glass car. It's said that it was designed and manufactured by many engineers before the war. The designer of this car is Mr. William Stout, a highly experienced airplane and car designer, so he called this glass car the "Stout Scarab."</p>
<p>How happy the nouveau riche with money must be when they hear this news! I hope Mr. William Stout of America quickly speeds up production, produces in large quantities, and ships them to Shanghai for those gentlemen, ladies, and young ladies to use. Otherwise, they will be so anxious that they will jump up and down like ants in a hot pot.</p>
<p>However, young men and women who can only afford glass belts and glass handbags certainly admire glass cars, but their hearts are willing, but their strength is not enough, which adds another layer of pain.</p>
<p>Today in China, half the people are suffering, and half the people are joking and chasing after vanity.</p>
<p>Glass sees through the hearts of Shanghai people, but Shanghai people themselves don't want to see through it!</p>
<p>Shanghai made of glass, be careful, one day it will break!</p>
<h3>Worshipping the Old Boss</h3>
<p>— Mo Su</p>
<p>Early Monday morning, as usual, I went to the office to work, waiting for the tram at a certain tram stop. At the same time, there were three newsboys, the oldest around twelve or thirteen years old, and the youngest only about ten years old. Each held a stack of newspapers and shouted to customers to buy. I prepared to buy a Shen Bao from the youngest newsboy. As I paid the money and the boy was reaching for a Shen Bao to hand to me, suddenly, the older boy snatched the newspaper from his hand with a snap. The newsboy was so anxious that he almost cried. I was a bit confused, thinking it was a business dispute, so I scolded the older boy, saying, "Buying a newspaper is my freedom; I can buy from whomever I want. How can you be so rude?" The older boy glared and angrily said, "Selling newspapers here is divided into territories. He (pointing to the younger boy) is not from our territory. How can he be allowed to cross the line and steal business?" Hearing this, I couldn't help but feel emotional and angrily shouted, "What territories? Chinese affairs are ruined by territories. You're so young, and you already have territories in your minds. No wonder you have endless infighting over territories." The older boy became even more enraged and said, "We all worship the Old Boss. He doesn't worship our Old Boss! I'll go get the Old Boss." Saying that, he pulled another slightly older newsboy and hurried away, turning into a certain alley. After a while, the two boys came out of the alley, followed by two typical "old boss" figures, wearing matching open-collar black gauze short shirts and pants, with a long white silk belt tied around their waists. One of them, who was taller, held the Shen Bao that had just been snatched in his hand, with a very unpleasant expression, walking towards me menacingly. I thought they must be looking for trouble. I needed to catch the tram to the office, so I didn't have time to argue with them. If I suffered a loss in front of everyone, I would be ridiculed by the many bystanders. I deeply regretted meddling. But the two old bosses had already approached, spouting nonsense. I had no choice but to steel myself and reason with them, hoping to subdue them with words. Unexpectedly, before I could speak, the taller old boss widened his eyes and said with a stern face, "Who dares to challenge the local tyrant? I've been eating and drinking in this territory for over a decade. Whoever wants to share my leftovers will have to answer to my fists." As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and cracked his knuckles, displaying the style of a hooligan. I thought to myself that I had met a brute, and reasoning was useless. The situation had become tense. At this moment, the younger boy whose newspaper had been snatched, began to cry again. Just then, a tall man suddenly emerged from behind me, scolding in a Shandong accent, "What are you? Territories? Open your eyes and see what era it is!" I heard two crisp "smack" sounds, and the old boss was slapped twice on the face. The performance was very swift and decisive. The onlookers clapped and cheered. The other old boss who came with him pulled the beaten old boss and said, "Boss, give the newspaper back to the kid. Let's go find Grandpa to talk to them." The beaten old boss threw the newspaper on the ground, turned around, and ran away. At this time, the tram arrived at the stop, and passengers swarmed on board. I also boarded the tram. The man from Shandong patted me on the shoulder and said with a smile, "Old brother, to talk about peace, you still have to rely on force. Reasoning is useless!" I expressed my deep gratitude and returned a knowing smile.</p>

<h3>Two Scientists</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhitang</p>
<p>A friend told me this story: A French scientist, after his research, announced to the public, "The moon and the earth are going to collide." When people heard this news, they were very surprised. But the people of Paris simply indulged in entertainment; they spent huge sums of money to eat, watch movies, and dance, preparing to die after enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>A Chinese scientist in Paris, without doing any research, announced to the public, "The moon and the earth will not collide." As a result, many people visited him and asked him for his reasons, but he kept saying, "I know they won't collide." In the end, he bet a large sum of money with the French.</p>
<p>When the day that the French scientist announced the moon and the earth would collide arrived, the moon and the earth really did not collide. As a result, the Chinese scientist got a lot of money. At the same time, many people visited him again. This Chinese scientist said, "I don't need to do research to know they won't collide. Don't you think so? Even if they were going to collide, wouldn't everyone die together? I wouldn't have to take out money, and you couldn't say to me, 'You were wrong...'"</p>
<h3>A Smile</h3>
<p>— Frozen Wei, translated from Corner</p>
<p>"Children, do you remember what I said last week? That you should do something to make others happy this week. How many of you have already done it?" the teacher asked.</p>
<p>A child happily raised his hand and said, "Teacher, I have done it."</p>
<p>The teacher praised him, "Very good, how did you do it?"</p>
<p>The child replied, "I went to visit my aunt May. When I said I was going home, she was extremely happy."</p>
<h3>Outside the School Gate</h3>
<p>— Yang Yurun</p>
<p>Four children, A, B, C, and D, were squatting by the corner of the wall, gathered together playing a "game" of cards – sand crabs. They were deeply interested and mentally tense. Suddenly, the "all-in" bet in front of child A was lost to the "flush" in child B's hand. So:</p>
<p>A (anxiously snatched a torn old hundred-yuan bill from B's hand, stood up, and said to B): "Convinced or not?"</p>
<p>B (jumped up from the ground, grabbed A's left hand holding the bill): "Not convinced! What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>A: "Humph! I'll flatten you..."</p>
<p>B: (made a fist with his right hand, extended his middle finger, and put it in front of A): "Here..."</p>
<p>A twisted B's hand in response; and then, the two started fighting...</p>
<p>C (counted the money in front of him while laughing loudly at A and B): "Haha..."</p>
<p>D (sat leisurely on the ground, hugging his knees with both hands): "Good! Energetic!"</p>
