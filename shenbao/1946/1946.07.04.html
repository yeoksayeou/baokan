<h3>國共直接談判　未獲結果　今日中午繼續會談　周恩來昨曾防馬帥</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕聞政府及中共代表五人，昨晚在普陀路八號陳誠參謀總長寓邸舉行之兩小時會談，雙方曾就軍事三人會議而未決之整編統編軍隊，暨共軍駐區問題，蘇北行政權問題，坦奉交換意見，對目前共軍中原軍區李先念部竄擾平漢鐵路信陽，柳林，各地之突發事件，亦略曾提及。　以中共代表周恩來，董必武，對待決之整軍及駐地問題，意存閃避，希望召開政協會議，以國拖延，故會談未獲結果。惟雙方代表在會談時，尙能平心靜氣，交換意見。散會時，曾相約俟互作考慮後，約期續談。據某權威人士吿本報記者云：就昨夜國共雙方代表首次會議之結果觀察，目前有關共軍駐區問題之癥結，顯在中共所提各項政治性之要求，此一問題，內容極為複雜，似非短時期所能談妥，預料國北雙方直接談判，當可使商談之時間儘量縮短。</p>

<h3>社論　今年的七月四日</h3>
<p>—菲律濱獨立的回顧與前瞻—</p>
<p>七月四日是北美合衆國的獨立紀念日；今年七月四日，更是菲律濱共和國宣布獨立的國慶日。經過四十八年的美國保護以後，菲律濱現在成爲一個獨立自由的國家。中國與美菲二國，都是太平洋的國家，我們要爲美國賀，更爲菲國賀！</p>
<p>菲律濱的獨立問題，在過去曾經提出過好幾次了。美菲的關係，同英印的關係，過去恰好成一鮮明的反襯。印度人屢次要爭獨立，英國政府却遲遲地不讓他們獨立。菲律濱的人原先却不十分想獨立，在過去有幾次到是美國人要他們獨立。這種特殊的狀態，只有就菲律濱的地勢來說明。菲律濱處於日本和美國中間，而日本對菲律濱素來就有野心的。菲律濱自己的軍事力量，到現在來說，不過常備軍四萬人，决不能抵抗日本的侵略，沒有美國的援助，她眞正的獨立也是空想。然而在美國方面，當孤立派抬頭的時候，决不願意因爲保護一個菲律濱而引起國際的糾紛。至於經濟方面，就算美國不賠本，至少也沒有多大的利益。所以在孤立派的美國人看來，菲律濱對於美國，似乎多少是一個累贅。現在日本勢力崩潰，雙方都願意保持獨立關係，這當然是很自然的事情。然而在經濟和軍事方面，許多菲律濱人還非常的焦慮，以爲一旦獨立，將會失掉從美國方面得來的急切需要的援助，於是願意展延獨立的時期。</p>
<p>在這一次大選中間，奧斯敏納是主張獨立的，羅哈斯却讓他的代言人阿魏林羅替他宣言主張延期，結果羅哈斯却反而當選。這至少在一方面可以反映；菲律濱人是十分願意獨立的，然而因爲情勢的關係，在願意中間，還多少帶了一點憂慮。</p>
<p>菲律濱新總統羅哈斯，是一位進步的人物。羅哈斯在日本佔領的時候，統率游擊隊對日繼續作戰，一直到他被日本人俘虜，纔一度加入僞組織，但是他的地位不高。他是一位非常能幹的人，麥克阿瑟元帥特別對他表示信心。在大選成功以後，他宣佈他的政策，第一是重新建設菲律濱，第二是澈底和美國合作。這兩條路錢，可以說是互相關聯的。一直到今天，菲律濱共和國還似乎沒有力量可以完全脫離美國。沒有美國的幫助，菲律濱的獨立和復興，必定感到非常吃力。政治獨立是一回事，經濟和軍事獨立却又是一回事。</p>
<p>假如國際局面能够和平解決，美國對菲律濱也許願意完全撒手，菲律濱人自更願意取得完全的自由獨立。照目前的情勢來看，菲律濱還正需要她的保姆時時刻刻照顧她。在這兒，我們願意中華民族大家也注意這一個立國的基本原則。就是：假如一個國家經濟不能自主，軍事不能自衛的時候，單憑一個政治上的獨立，還是多少具有危險的。</p>
<p>依照新的協定，菲美兩國還是要繼續合作。在軍事方面，七千個羣島完全由菲律濱自己建設國防，但是美國的海軍依然保留牠在羣島中所有的根據地。這是菲律濱人所歡迎的，他們不得不歡迎，因爲有了這一個保護，菲律濱纔可以安全，不受任何野心國家的侵略。甚至於外交方面，美國也仍舊要幫助訓練菲律濱政府的人，以便將來分派出去作大使和公使。關於經濟方面，更要加强兩國的合作。</p>
<p>我們覺得美國的態度，和從前大不相同了。從前除掉國外貿易而外，她只想關着門，不管天下事。美國從前好像一位富家子弟，豐衣足食，優閑自在，看見別人要打架，趕快跑開，怕血花濺在身上。這一次的世界大戰，曾經給她一個沉痛的敎訓！美國人已深切認識：門羅主義不適合於現代的潮流，世界的安全，需要世界各國充分合作來建設和保持一個平衡的力量，這個平衡力量一經動搖，野心家就會乘機而起。在第一次大戰之後，美國沒有盡量扶持中國，以致引起了日本的野心；美國沒有積極千預歐洲的政治，以致造成德國侵略的機會。現在美國不但對於菲律濱，不再採取旁觀的態度，即對於世界上任何一角落，只要她發現有威脅和平的原素存在，她立刻願意採取一種積極的行動。如像特港劃歸南斯拉夫，要在過去的美國，對於這種問題，她决不會這樣堅决地反對的。</p>
<p>在遠人處來看，美國這一種態度，對於世界和平，是有幫助的。我們誠懇的希望，世界現在幾個强有力的國家，不但不要自己不侵略別人，還要互相合作，積極地消弭任何可以引起戰爭，引起野心家手癢的一切元素。愛好和平而又强大的國家，不能够關着門，對世界大局袖手旁觀，因爲火勢一旦爆發，繼續蔓延，很快地就可以燒到自己安樂的屋子。</p>
<p>我們要爲菲國人民慶幸，菲律濱共和國今天能够得到政治上的獨立，我們尤其希望菲律濱共和國在不久的將來，更能够確實得到軍事和經濟的獨立。我們要頌揚美國這種「以大事小」的精神，這種維持世界和平的精神，今天美國沒有完全放棄對於菲律濱的扶持，也沒有對於世界任何需要幫助的國家放棄了她義所應負的責任，就是她這種偉大精神的表現。</p>
<p>最後，我們相信菲律濱在能幹的羅哈斯總統的領導之下，各方面都會突飛猛進。我們更希望在中國最近和平統一之後，因中國和美菲兩國同處於太平洋，中國對於美利堅合衆國和菲律濱共和國，能够提供更大的同情和幫助，俾可並駕齊驅，共維世界和平於永久。</p>

<h3>美政府履行諾言　菲律賓獨立實現　向新舊帝國主義示威</h3>
<p>七月四日，菲律濱正式獨立了，意義之重大，不言可喻，下面是美國新聞週刋對於這次獨立意義的評價：</p>
<p>「一個國家自動將獨立許給一個種族不同資源豐富的殖民地民族，在近代歷史上尙是一個創舉。此舉於七月四日正式實現後，對於全世界殖民地及被壓迫民族將引起嚴重的反響。這是美國對於西方老帝國主義和東方新帝國主義的一個答覆」。</p>
<p>獨立的過程</p>
<p>按照一九三四年美國參議院所通過的「泰丁斯—馬杜克費法案〕，菲律濱到一九四六年七月四日，就要完全脫離美國殖民地的地位，而開始獨立了。</p>
<p>菲律濱在爭取獨立的過程中，也曾遭遇過若干波折。在一九四〇年舉行總統競選運動的時候，國內對獨立運動也有兩種不同的見解，其中一派由前總統奎松代表，贊成菲律濱獨立，而另一派則由文加洛代表主張把菲律濱變成美利堅合衆國的一州而頗能獲得一部份美國人的同情和支持。在這種情形之下，奎松無法另一候選人奧斯敏那携手，彼此成立協定，相約在競選獲勝之後，由奎松任總統，奧斯敏那任副總統。就在這種優越條件之下，文加洛當然被擊敗了。</p>
<p>但是在菲律濱正向獨立大道邁進的時候，却在一九四一年發生了太平洋大戰。當然經過了美軍撤退，日軍佔領以及美軍再來等重大變化之後，戰後的菲律濱當然和五年以前有着顯著的不同。所以，在菲律濱從日軍手中獲得解放以來，獨立問題曾一度再成為討論的中心。當時也有一部份人主張菲律濱暫不實行獨立。但是美國對於這個問題態度非常鮮明。美參議員泰丁斯在菲律濱獲得解放之後，就立刻代表美國大總統到當地去實行非常詳細的調查和考察，而在返美之後，就向總統提出報吿，堅決主張「菲律濱的獨立，已經是一個確定無疑的問題」。美國駐菲專員麥克納也說：「吾人已允於一九四六年七月四日給予菲律濱人以獨立，菲人若不願獲得這種地位，其主動應該屬於菲人，美國絕不採取主動地位。菲律濱的獨立已經不成問題，我們的工作就是如何替菲律濱人準備獨立，而應該堅決的向這個目標邁進」。凡此種種，都說明美國對於履行已往的諾言是如何澈底，而要使信義昭彰於世界。</p>
<p>羅哈斯勝利</p>
<p>現在，菲律濱決定在七月四日實行獨立了，這是遠東以至全世界的一個重大喜訊，我們要為菲律濱人光明的前途慶賀！</p>
<p>獨立菲律濱的第一任總統，已由本年四月間舉行的選舉決定為羅哈斯。為了說明菲律濱的政治發展情形，讓我們把羅哈斯競選獲勝的經過情形簡單地叙述一下。</p>
<p>在這一次大選裏，有力的總統候選人一共有兩個：一個是奧斯敏那，他在太平洋戰爭爆發菲律濱淪入敵手之後，與奎松總統一同飛往美國，而在奎松病逝之後，繼任總統，隨美軍克復菲律濱而凱旋歸來；另一個是羅哈斯，他是菲律濱參議院議長，頗能獲得人民大衆的同情，而戰時留菲的地下工作人員也由羅氏領導，勞績卓著。</p>
<p>在這次競選之前，奧氏自以為佔有絕對優勢，因為他覺得有好幾點對他有利：（一）他當時還是菲律濱的大總統，現成的環境條件給他不少方便；（二）勁敵羅哈斯戰時留於菲律濱，遭遇一部份人士的物議；（三）縱容共產黨，以謀在競選中獲得他們的支持；（四）擁有一部份資本家做他的後臺。但是結果却是羅哈斯獲勝，奧斯敏那失敗，殊出一般人的意料之外！</p>
<p>事實上羅哈斯的獲勝，也不是無因的：（一）他是奎松的嫡系，獲得奎松夫人的支持；（二）戰時和游擊隊保持密切聯繫而得到他們的信任；（三）力主消滅共產黨，以謀維持全菲律濱的治安；（四）得到西班牙系資本家的支助。</p>
<p>此外，羅哈斯是一個出色的宣傳家和政治家，具有濃厚的國家主義思想，能够提出動人的政策來爭取大多數民衆的擁護。反之，奧斯敏那却不擅長演說，年巡好靜，各方比較怠慢了一點，以致給予對方反攻的機會。</p>
<p>未來的展望</p>
<p>羅哈斯挺身而出，擔任艱鉅的工作。他信仰美國的崇高目標與高强能力，羅哈斯是一個有力而雄辯的演說家。他為了菲律濱亟需經濟援助，乃鼓其三寸如簧之舌，想博得美國人的同情。他像一般靈敏的菲律濱人一樣，懂得美國人好戴高帽子的心理。他曾在國內受過美國式敎育，從事美國式政治凡二十餘年。因此他習慣於美國的生活，他在美國參議院或衆議院中態度自若，同時一般國會議員也對他很相熟。</p>
<p>羅哈斯的當選，在內政上預示一種比較進步和開明政策的來臨，而在國際方面，除了和美國保持密切的友好關係之外，並希望和中，暹·法·蘇等國締盟，以鞏固其國際地位。就全世界的形勢說，聯合陣綫上，又將添加有力的一員，就美國在東方的形勢說，他又獲得了一個新生的盟友。全世界和美國都應該竭力協助菲國去鞏固獨立，增進繁榮，是非常顯明的。</p>

<p>〔路透社海牙三日電〕荷蘭新內閣，今日在女王威廉明娜前宣訾就職。新閣係由天主敎黨，勞工黨及無黨派人物混合組成。名單如次：總理兼內長比爾（天主敎黨），外長奧斯特羅（無黨派），司法長馬爾塞文（天主敎黨），敎育部長季倫（天主敎黨），財長李夫丁克（勞工黨），陸海軍部長費佛慈（天主敎黨），工程部長林齋爾斯（無黨派），運輸部長伏斯（勞工黨），經濟部長舒斯曼（天主敎黨），農業曁糧食部畏曼斯霍爾特（勞工黨），社會福利部長特里斯（勞工黨），海外部長約克曼（無黨派），不管部閣員克里芬斯（無黨部）。</p>
<p>此次新閣遝遲組成，由於工黨要求推行進步社會政策，並以自治權賦予印尼，均須有充分之保證有以致之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海牙二日電〕荷蘭新總理比爾擬任命前總理許茂洪為駐印尼高級專員，推行前屆工黨政府之寬大政策，許氏將在巴達維亞就任，其職權超過代理總督范莫克，據可靠息：此事明日閣　即可決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞二日電〕昨脫險歸來之印尼總理沙利今日宣布：渠將赴爪哇中部印尼總部所在地之需克加卡泰，討論應付極端派之强力措施，並完成組閣工作。又悉：印尼總統蘇卡　定明日接見印尼各政治及愛國團體領袖。與沙利同時被綁之人尙未出險，但所在已明。蘇卡諾已下令速將彼等釋放。</p>
<h3>原子能委會</h3>
<p>表決規則問題起爭執</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：聯合國原子能委員會今日召集會議，解決表決規則問題。對有七國之多數表決已可決議一節，十二國代表中有十一國同意，但蘇聯堅持八國之數。</p>
<h3>四外長會議　特港管理問題　又發生新異議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：關於特港管理權問題，蘇聯與西方國家之間今日雖又發生新異議，但衆信最後可以獲得妥協，和平會議今夏當可召集。</p>
<h3>遷政府昨宣佈　入於緊急狀態</h3>
<p>〔合衆社曼谷三日電〕暹羅政府今日宣佈緊急狀態，警察實行普遍之報紙檢查，，聞當地有若千報紙將奉令停刋。惟政府並未說明宣佈緊急狀態之原因。</p>
<h3>莫斯科方面宣布　全國物價减四成　　美撤銷物價管理聲中　不啻投一「經濟炸彈」</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山二日電〕比基尼島原子彈投擲甫畢，蘇聯亦投下經濟炸彈一枚，是否有意，則不得而知。據莫斯科宣佈，全國工業製造品巿價一律减低百分之四十，海聯成以為美國物價統制旣隨物價管理局之結束而吿消逝，則此種措施，或將引起美國重大注意。實際抑低物價之舉，在蘇聯醞釀已久，蘇聯人民無疑認其必能成為事實。惟現有一問題，即從個人購買力而言，蘇聯物價究已减低若十，據最近莫斯科消息，蘇聯人民之真正購買力，不在其手中有錢之多少，而在其究有若干配給證可供消費。配給設隨各人之工作而異，向店肆購買配給物品，價格甚廉。一般民衆所獲配給數量，雖不能使生活過分舒適，但可衣食無慮。彼等若有餘資，可往特種商店購貨，惟其中陳列貨品並不配給，索價甚昂。蘇聯此次實行减低物價四成，即指此特種商店內之物品而言，吾人因此可知蘇聯人民以前有餘款可置奢侈品及額外用品者，今後生活將更舒適，以前無力購買侈品者，現亦可如願以償。美物價管理甫吿終結，蘇聯即採取措施减低物價，此時而有此舉，或非偶然。</p>
<h3>岡田荒謬證辭　美加以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京三日電〕日前首相岡田啓介昨在國際法庭作證時稱：「聞美國對日本之進駐「滿洲」，曾與以暗中諒解。」美國務院發言人對此立即加以否認，斥為無稽之談。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京三日電〕岡田昨在國際法庭提供虛偽證詞，關美國限制移民，使人口過剩之日本不得不向滿洲發展。岡田稱：美日兩國曾有君子協定，　認日本此種大陸擴張政策。此言，顯指一九一七年十一月間之　辛石井協定。當時美國務卿藍辛有公函一件，內稱：「美日兩國政府承認，領土之接近，造成國際間之特殊關係，是以美政府承認日本在中國有特殊利益，尤對中國領土毗連部份為然。岡田指出此點，即為對日向滿洲擴展之信號，惟該藍辛石井協定亦曾約束雙方尊重中國主權及門戶開放原則。國際法庭今日續審時，東條之律師淸瀨亦謂日移民滿洲及朝鮮，係受美禁止移民影響，因而成為太平洋戰爭起因之一。首席法官魏勃即謂：吾人不注意移民，祗要訊問戰爭。淸瀨答稱：日人移殖滿洲朝鮮，實為戰爭原因之一。</p>
<h3>遠東委會通過　日本新憲原則</h3>
<p>內容　守秘密</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕遠東委員會今日一致通過日本新憲法之根本原則，以謀在日本樹立民主政府。該項決議案已送交麥帥，俾與日皇裕仁於本年初向議會所提出新憲法相對照。惟遠東委員會各代表不願透露決議案內容，相約保守秘密，以待與麥帥磋商。但聞附有條件，希望列入新憲法。</p>
<h3>美海軍發表計劃　構築偉大防禦綱　基地遍及兩洋及赤道南北　此後即可無需採跳島戰術</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕美海軍正在完成戰後　大之基地系統，以鞏固美國及西半球防務。此項基地遍及太平大西兩洋與赤道南北，包括潛艇及海空設備，此後如遇戰爭，即可毋需採用跳島戰術，以免多損兵力。此偉大之防禦系統，一旦成立，對於維持世界永久和平，當有絕大貢獻。其計劃詳情探誌如下：</p>
<p>大西洋方面基地，包括英屬西印度羣島中之安蒂瓜與聖魯西亞，紐芬蘭北部之阿根狄那及弗羅里達州西南海岸附近英屬巴哈馬羣島中之大愛克舒馬島。太平洋方面自阿留申羣島至非律濱，澳洲，美屬蔽摩亞島，復回至檀香山。在此巨大之三角形內，美海軍將利用一向不受人注意之海島設防，如恩尼威德，馬如洛，瓜雅林，琉球及馬納斯島等。</p>
<p>兩洋基地　聯成一片</p>
<p>太平大西兩洋中共有三十九處將在此龐大計劃中聯成一片，惟內中多有在外國管理下者，必先商得同意，方能進行建設。馬納斯島在新幾尼島北面數哩處，一向無人注意，其地距檀香山約四千哩，白人曾見該島者甚少，惟在美國決定擊敗日本之計劃中，殊佔重要地位，因此其名始著。該島而積不大，惟有一天然良港，至少可容船隻千艘，美海軍曾在戰時建築一重要之作戰基地。馬納斯島本為太平洋德屬地之一部，第一次世界大戰後，出國聯委託澳洲代管。</p>
<p>馬納斯島　重要據點</p>
<p>美海軍稱馬納斯島為其太平洋防禦計劃中必不可少之重要據點，惟澳洲方面尙在躊躇，不敢遽以美海軍所需之特權相許，至其原因為何，尙待詳細說明。美國務院與澳外部正在商談此事，一旦談判完成，美海軍自信必可獲得准許。此外在環斯敦，巴爾密拉，及康敦羣島等散佈於珍珠港西南一千八百哩內之島與，美海軍亦擬建築空軍基地，英美對以上各島皆自稱保有主權，但不難成立協定，以便建設基地。中太平洋則有日本委治地八處，現在美國當握，將設立海軍航空基地。美海軍在阿留申羣島中之亞達克及菲律濱，亦將建設次要之作戰基地。亞達克本屬美國，菲列濱方面協商正在進行。</p>
<p>利用臺灣　須先協商</p>
<p>關島與蘇班島為太平洋防禦系統中之又一要點。兩島在日本南約一千五百哩，為美國最西之作戰基地，現正在建築中。琉球距日本本土僅數百哩，經美海軍奪取後，亦擬在此設立作戰基地。美國第七艦隊現泊中國海面，但此係暫時性質，美海軍在中國沿海並無永久設備。台灣或可成為美艦隊之停泊地，但必先與中國協商。美國第十二艦隊駐防日本，以擁護麥帥及其佔領軍，其留駐時間將視需要而定，惟日本並未列入美海軍之太平洋防禦計劃。</p>
<p>西印羣島　防務佈置</p>
<p>大西洋中之主要防禦綱為加里比安區。美海軍希望在巴哈馬羣島中之大愛克舒馬島，及英屬西印羣島中之雅美加，安蒂瓜，聖書西亞，與英屬圭亞那及特里尼達從事建設，以上各島，皆在英國國旗之下。加里比安區中尙有屬於古巴之關太納莫，波多黎谷之聖瞿安及羅斯福路，阜琴羣島中之聖多馬，巴拿馬運河東端之古古沙魯，與運河區太平洋邊之巴爾巴。美海軍於北大西洋則擬在冰島及格林蘭建設工事，格林蘭現為丹麥所有。美海軍除獲得所需基地，建築設備之外，其主要問題則在佔領與保管所需之人力。至於船隻方面，足供此兩洋防禦計劃之需要而有餘。</p>
<h3>蘇研究院製成　新雷達光學器</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科二日電〕蘇聯新聞社今日宣稱：蘇聯某實騐硏究院已試騐成功世上一最小之機械，乃一種雷達光學器械，上有小孔，直徑僅四千分之一耗。</p>
<h3>原子彈威力結論　美海長謂海軍仍可保留　克寧漢上將持相同見解</h3>
<p>二次試驗將於廿二日舉行</p>
<p>〔路透社比基尼島二日電〕美海長福萊斯特今日於視察各受損之船舶後發表構：此次原子彈試騐可得兩項結論：（一）裝厚甲之巨艦仍不易沉沒，除非其水面以下之部份亦已受傷。（二）海軍之地位仍可保留。此次試騐最驚人之結果即為主力艦受損最輕，主力艦「本雪凡尼亞」號上有山羊兩頭仍吿生存，安然在艦上吃草。但專家預料該兩羊將不堪無綫　波之壓迫而死去。頃悉所有靶子艦七十三艘均受有程度不同之損傷，艦面之輕型設備，如雷達，網等均破壞甚烈。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕海軍總司令克寧漢上將今日向記者公會發表談話稱：不論原子彈之有無，英國海軍仍認海椱為戰爭之决定力量。原子彈對於泊在海面固定地點之主力艦，或能有破壞效能，但此種效果在正式作戰時期决不致發生。</p>
<p>〔法國社電〕第二次原子彈試騐將於廿二日舉行，炸彈當在海水廿五呎之下爆裂。據白朗第司令之意，第一次試騐所未轟沉之軍艦，屆時必化為島有。</p>
<h3>猶太復國運動　美允予協助</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二日電〕總統府發言人頃談稱：杜魯門總統本日接見猶太復國運動委會美代表時，對於巴勒斯坦之最近發展之情形，表示扼腕。總統吿以英政府此次抄查耶路撒冷猶太復國委員會會址，事前並未與本人諮商。本人將竭力恊助十萬猶太人移入巴勒斯坦，美國並進備負担運送移民時各種技術上及經濟上之責任。余望被拘之各猶太領袖即可獲釋，而秩序亦得以恢復原狀。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷二日電〕頃悉星期六被捕之海發猶太領袖達夫海，已獲釋放。</p>
<p>被拘猶人　備受酷刑</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二日電〕巴勒斯坦猶太公會今日指責巴勒斯坦警察對拘留中之漪人實施酷刑，受傷甚重，或將終身殘廢者，為數甚多。甚至有逍受毆辱，性器官被拉，並在臂腋下挾石，歷數小時之久。</p>

<h3>宋院長召見船業界領袖　商維護航權辦法　接受出席代表提出緊急建議七項　開放沿海各口命令即可實行取消</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時，行政院院長宋子文氏，如今航業界領袖杜　，錢永銘，楊晉北，李雲良，黃浩雲等，垂詢最近船業情形，商討今後維護航　及發展船業之真　辦法。當經各代表詳陳我國船業界所遭遇之各種困難及痛苦，根據事實，特別　陳外商侵犯航　之危機，並建議以下各種緊急措施：</p>
<p>（一）撤銷開放長江四口內河航行權之原議，至爲節省轉口費用起見，儘可規定我國所購由美來華之船隻，優光承運至長江各口之物資。且美國剩餘船隻中，合於遠洋航行之船甚多，我國儘可乘此時機，開關遠洋航綫，　無招引外輪入江，影響航權之理。（二）取消行總租賃英船之合同，此項合同，於本月十六日到期，半年來各英船假借運送救濟物資名義，帶運大宗商貨，流弊甚多。現招商局有海船三十九艘，計十四萬噸，計萬四餘噸，而救濟物資過去六個月中，平均每月下過二萬二千三百九十噸，此後即加兩三倍計算，爲整亦屬無多，確無繼續租用外船之必要。（三）取銷開放沿海各口之命令，查江海關於於公告，「案奉總稅務司轉奉財政部渝字第二二八二八號代電，奉行政院電，在中國各港口間運載貨物及旅客，以中國船隻爲限，府機關委用之外國商船，爲善後救濟起見，得暫行往來各港口間，載運貨物及旅客，至三十六年三月三十一日爲止等因，轉行到關，合行佈告週知，此佈。」前次命令流弊甚多，六月二十四日本古洋行牛莊輪，假借運送麵粉二百噸之名義，　儎商貨二千五百噸，運費達二萬萬數千萬元，足資引證，應請明令取消此項命令，以維航權，而杜流弊。（四）救購英商在華之船業資產，依照平等新約之規定，英國已放棄在華之內河及沿海航行權，其原有之船業，中國政府準備以公平價格收購，現查太古怡和兩洋行有僞記華商名義，繼續操縱我國航權之企圖，應請政府迅速向英國方面交涉，轉讓沿江海之碼頭倉庫及船舶，如各該洋行以中英合資組織之公司向我政府註册，應請查明眞相，是否確有華股三分之二以上，合於海商法第三條之規定，以防朦蔽。（五）協助航商購船，我國航商在此次戰役中，犧牲船舶卅除萬噸，亟需救濟與扶植，現查美國國會已通過出售剩餘船舶之法案，售價照建造成本著千成計算，第一次付款百分之二十五，其餘數分廿年攤繳，擬懇政府與美國治購大批合於我國水道之船舶，以原條件轉讓與各民營輪船公司。（六）整理上海港政，請設上海港政局，參照青島港政成規，整理建設上海港之倉庫碼頭或設上海碼頭倉庫公司，積極經營，並明令上海爲東方大港，以代替實業計劃中原定在乍浦建設東方大港之地位，而儘速開放現有之碼頭倉庫。（七）確定航業政策，我國航業政策，雖在戰事結束以前，迭經國防最高委員會召集小組會議討論議定方案，至今尙未公布，而復員以來，本國航業，亟待建立，尤需政府積極之扶植，以適應運輪之需要，應請政府迅賜決策，制爲法令，而維航權於久遠。宋氏聽取代表各意見後，當表示大部份可以接受，惟關於取消開放沿海各口命令，以及行總租賃合同，即可實行，而樹立扶植民營航業政策，亦擬在最短期間予以公布。</p>
<h3>兩路局大舞弊案　款項追回三千餘萬　男女十七員役　昨併解地檢處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩路管理局材料處發生之一　二千一百七十萬元舞弊案，自經該局局長陳伯莊限令各關係人於四十八小時內全數將舞弊款項繳出，職候處置後，迄昨午止，各關係人所繳出者，僅及全數四分之一，計三千餘萬元。同時路局已奉交部命令，着將一干人犯從嚴懲辦。故該局於下午五時半，即由路局警備處備囚車一輛，將各有關人員計材料處長張鴻圖。副處長丁厚夫·採購課長張伯康·股長張澤隆·課員經偉鈞·陳景　·俞佩恩·李潔（女）·孫學山·蔡志道·夏定武·顧振民·朱必聞朱·培宗·李潤生（工役）及前該課課員張開源·王人　等十七名，移送地檢處偵訊。至已追返之款頂，先行移交地檢處，其餘款項則比比請該處繼續追繳。至張鴻圖之妻郁香嚴，路局以其避不見面，已函請軍警當局協助通緝。又自張鴻圖被捕後，材料處一切事務，昨已由該局副局長侯或華暫行兼代。</p>
<h3>美海長將來華</h3>

<h3>擴大紀念七七　籌備會成立</h3>
<p>勝利後第一屆七七抗戰紀念日，轉　即屆，中　當局爲紀念抗戰列殉難軍民起見，由國府電令各省市政府擴大紀念，並舉行抗戰殉難軍民追悼會，對殉難烈士家屬及傷病將士，予以精神與物質慰勞。是日全國城市下半族誌哀，並停止娛樂，正午十二時警報一長聲，或鳴鐘爲標記，全國人民各就原地立正靜默一分鐘誌哀。本市黨政各界特組織七七紀念籌備會，業於昨日成立。預定七日上午九時，假天蟾舞台舉行抗戰殉難軍民追憶大會，推定吳國楨，宣鐵吾，杜月笙，潘公展，程中行，吳紹澍，徐寄　，周學湘，唐天恩，錢劍秋，周雯成，爲主席團，吳開先爲籌備總幹事，俞叔平爲大會總指揮。</p>
<h3>衛生局長急得團團轉　時疫醫院日用鹽水八百磅　霍亂預防極容易不吃生冷菜要熟</h3>
<p>記者以圾悲痛的情緒，同各界報告參觀上轟時疫病院的經過，要告訴讀者，霍亂的萋延、已進入羨猖獗的階段了！</p>
<p>上海現在總計有九所時疫醫院，但是沒有一家不宣告「客滿」的！上海時疫病院的大門口，高懸「本院病房已滿，已無空餘病床」的牌子，但他門外用三輪車，黃包車，藤椅持病人來院，還是很多，記者走進該院的大門，就看見一切睡在藤椅上剛送到的病人，家屬圍在四周，忙著替他揉擦正抽痙的四肢，一面苦苦哀求醫院當局，但是負責人的回答是：「住院是絕對不可能的，我們只能代為注射救命針，打究援就請你們扛回家，假使不好的時候，再打得來重打」．</p>
<p>這並不是院方的殘忍，見死不救，而實在是「愛莫能助」，現在該院的走廊，天井，都已成了臨特的病房，再也沒育空位可以收納病人，每天早最經醫治出院的，約有四五中人，但是不到二個鐘頭，立該又塡滿！後來的人，就只能「打回樣」．現在院內工作的情緒極度緊張，一切設施都日夜工作，平均醫師每天工作八小時，看護工作十二小時，汗流怏背忙碌情形，決不在戰地醫院之下。</p>
<p>據該院院長那青山告訴記者，霍亂的蔓延，也已經　展劉中上階級，日內患者，教育界，銀行界、錢莊界等都有、曾經有某銀行行長的太太因為病房無空，在走廊中屈住了－夜。</p>
<p>該院備肴饑水注射室，凡是需要打鹽水的，都由病房抬入室內，實行注射．大多數病人，在注射鹽水的時候，還是不停地瀉着。患霍亂的人，瀉到後來，大便純似清水，經過注射多量鹽水後，腹瀉才可以止住，該院的鹽水係自己製備，一天平均要用到八百磅之多。</p>
<p>據鄧院長說：在該院過去的經騐中，年紀最大的是七十七歲，最小的是八天。原來是有一個即子便　早產養了下來，這孩子生不逢辰，在第八天，不幸受產婦傳染得了霍亂，八天的嬰孩，就要　　鹽水的滋味，但可喜的是，母子竟然均安。最後，鄧院長告訴記者，霍亂並不是不能預防的，而且霍亂菌極容易死，只要平日不喝生水，把青菜煮熟，瓜菓在開水中泡一泡，便可以確保安全。</p>
<p>記者於離開上海時疫醫院後，覺得情形實在太嚴重了，所以便　立刻趕到市府衛生局拜訪張維局長。據張局長告訴記者說：爲了疫　的嚴重，他已經許多天不能安睡，恨不得一天能夠多有幾個鐘頭，讓衛生局同人加緊工作。（聖心）</p>
<p>聯總飛運藥來</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕聯總署長拉加第區今日宣稱，聯總擬即以急需之醫藥及器材三〇·〇〇〇顧飛機運上海，以撲滅霍亂。該項飛機藥物，即將自舊金山裝船運往上海。空運只需六日，船運則約需三星期。</p>
<p>雨後更要小心</p>
<p>昨日豪雨，各低　處，積水盈尺，溝渠擁塞，霍亂細菌，傳佈極速，希望市民對於包含格外注意。昨日霍亂患者六十八人，死七人，連前共計一〇三四人，死八十一人，內有外僑計蘇聯藉三人，澳洲籍一人。</p>
<h3>大雨下奇觀　陸水行舟　美國兵會尋開心　黃包車利市三倍　上海估計有三分之一浸在水中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據說這二天的大雨，是受了原子彈的影響，氣象學家也分了兩派，有的承認，有的否認。究竟如何，我們不知，不過至少這次的大雨，爲近年所少見，却是事實。據昨日氣象台長鄭子政報告，昨天的雨量共有九十七米厘，約合三·九英吋。「這樣的大雨，今天當可停止了」，鄭臺長表示。</p>
<p>對大水表示歡迎的，是小孩子，他們玩水，讓大人們叫苦連天。滬西一逞，自霞飛略底至亞爾培路一段，愚園路·地豐路·海格路·善鐘路·進爾西愛路等，都是泱泱大水。高樓如華　公寓，國際飯店，永安公司等都像　築在消遣。有軌電都停駛了，紅色公共汽車載着比往常更多的重負，在無積水的馬路上來去。三輪車黃包車莫不利市百倍，　一個渡，五百一千，路途比較遙遠的，車錢超過出差汽車。西區一帶深水處，美軍浮着橡皮艇往來。陸地行舟，在他們看來，該是一種奇蹟。許多汽車在水面跟來幫忙推車子　外快。水彌漫在人行道上，店員們帶着悠閒的店索性關起門來。</p>
<p>霞飛路社會局的廣塲內，變成一個大池，馬浪路上，一個十歲左右的孩子，跌在水裏，趁勢斜倒身體游泳起来。水高过膝，长统套鞋也没有用，在污水漏进长统套鞋以后，记者就坐黄包车回来。整个的上海，大概有三分之一的地面浸在水中。</p>
<p>據气象学家所说，上海已臨到黄霍李，此后大槪有二十天的雨期。套鞋和雨衣，又是得势的时候了。</p>
<h3>「六月初三排一陣上午耘稻下午睏」　本月中尙有大水　趙局長雨後招待記者　報告巡視積水情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕根據民二十四年上海年鑑統計，七月份平均雨量爲一五〇·四種，最高紀錄爲三六九·五糎。又據徐家匯大文台報告，本年三月二十七日一天雨量達六十五糎，爲十五年來所未有。而據市工務局統計，前晨九時至昨晨九時一天之雨量，竟達九十糎（三英寸半），超過三月二十七日三分之一弱。</p>
<p>市工務局局長趙祖康，昨日清晨起及下午，曾親往各區視察雨後情形，積水以林森中路·茂名南路·思南路東·天潼路·浙江路·番禺路·膠路·康定路，愚園路東段等一帶爲最多。趙局長特於昨日下午四時半，接見各報記者，報告此次大雨積水原因：（一）雨量過多，又適值漲潮，昨日上午三時零四分水位最高超出水面一二·一呎，下午以三時三十九分最高，爲一〇·六五呎。而低　馬路，普通均在水面以上十至十一呎。趙氏並稱：俗語云「六月初三排一陣，上午耘稻下午?」，本月內尙有大水發生。（二）水管狹小，不易暢洩，現有抽水站七處，計麥根路·福建路·西藏路·乍浦路·中正東路外灘·福州路外灘及靶子路等，以麥根路站爲最大，各站於昨晨三時起，即開始抽水，故愛女義路及慕爾嗚路水已稍退，而康定路並不見效，因水管口經僅十二時。（三）通浜工作未完，該局疏通法華浜，將於二週後完工，肇家浜於月底竣工，現正作壩挖泥，故流水被阻，昨晨已予拆除。同時陰溝格利，因被垃圾汙塞，八年未通，難於清除。</p>
<h3>取締黃色刊物　再接再厲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警察局對市上出售誨淫海盜之刋物，決予嚴厲取締，上週將「風流寡婦」，「享子間嫂嫂」等八種書藉全部沒收。又有未向中宣部登記這黃色刋物三十三種，亦予禁止發售，並通令書報業公會不准代爲經售。</p>
<h3>美國國慶在上海　九年前今日的回憶</h3>
<p>抗戰以前，每年遇到七月四日，在上海的美國官民總要慶祝一下這一個光榮的紀念日。尤其是民國廿六年，也就是我們七七盧溝橋事變前二天的一次慶祝最爲熱烈。當時報紙的記載中有所謂「盡三日之狂歡」的形容，因爲那年七月四日，湊巧是禮拜，所以他們從三日起，就開始直到五日才停止。這裏不妨把那三天的節目抄出來跟今天勝利後的第一次紀念日比較一下，似乎也是頗饒興趣的事吧：</p>
<p>七月三日：下午三時半，跑馬　舉行籃球比賽。晚間九時，官民齊集哥倫比亞總會觀放焰火，並舉行盛大舞會。萬國商團美機槍隊發起租渡輪一艘，夜遊浦江。</p>
<p>七月四日：上午十時，美海軍陸戰隊假座國泰戲院舉行擴大禮拜，駐華按察使希爾密克演說美國建設史，普樂餘興　國　。</p>
<p>七月五日：美各機關一律放假　　致慶。上午八時在跑馬廳舉行升旗禮及閱兵禮。十二時在哥倫比亞總會舉行盛大茶會執行中外官員。市長俞鴻鈞，司令楊　及各國領　往賀者不下四百人，下廳行比賽放跑馬廳。</p>
<p>看到上的記載，確會令人起「　　盛哉」之感，而　一次的狂歡的確似乎有些「先見之明」，因爲沒有多少時候，中國的烽烟就從北方彌漫遍於全國。從廿七年起，由於我們　難方殷，美駐華大使詹森曾經下過電令各地官民不要過事慶祝，所以此後幾年的七月四日都在靜悄悄中度過，日本人進佔租界以後，在反英美的口號下，美利堅的官民們就祇好在集中營中消磨他們慘淡的歲月了。</p>
<p>時間推翻了一切，時間也恢復出現了一切的「USA」時，勝利後的第一個七月四日降臨了。美方慶祝的節目已在昨天報上詳細公佈，不過因爲速朝　雨，戶外的各項活動將改在七日舉行。</p>
<p>看到別人國慶的狂歡，回顧到　痍滿目的自己，每個中國人都免不了有些心酸之感吧？但顧傑弗遜總統「人類生存，自由，追求幸福」的輝煌宣言，在今天能再度予我們以無限的鼓勵！（飛鴻）</p>

<h3>房地產業公會要求　修改租賃管理規則　應保障合法者之產權　儘速取消二房東制度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市屋荒嚴重，租赁料纷迭起，本市房地产商業同業公會有鋻于此，爰于日前星文市府，请将「房屋租赁管理规则」予以修正，其理由共分三点：（一）該规则係根據戰事結束，該項條例業已廢止。且規則中所定如出租人與承租人間之租約，須申請登記，并經審查云云，已超出原條例所定範圍以外。（二）租賃糾紛，夙由司法機關處理，依民事訴訟法規定，房屋糾紛等　易案件，必須先經法院調解，調解不成，始得起訴，今規則中亦設有調解之規定，殊不割裂司法權之嫌。（三）規則中規定租賃契約，一律須向委員會登記，由其審查，而關於租金數額，又復一再加以限制，種種情形，不免侵犯人民訂立契約之自由。同時該會並達議各點如下：（一）應尊重業主之主權，並予以合法之利潤。現時本市房屋之支配權，完全操於二房東之手，而正當業主，反形成有產無權，業不自主之狀態，故首宜尊重業主之主權，使得有防止租戶非法侵佔之自衛權力。再現時業主負担奇重，如地捐·房捐·契稅·印花稅·租賃所得稅·保險費，以及房屋管理費等，爲數甚钜，租金收入，往往不敷開支，而事變以後房屋多未修葺，傾圯堪虞，似宜就其支出方面詳加檢討，最低限度亦應使其保全　業，免致陪累。（二）應保障原租戶合法權益，不准業主或羅租處有類外語索，或許辭收回轉租等情事，但同時亦應限制租戶，不得有非法侵佔業主之行爲，如現時二房東，以業主之房屋，任意分租，而收高價之租金，任意出價，以獲鎭額之頂費，任意分租，而主負担不必要修理之損失。（應）使未獲得住屋者有承租房屋之機會，積極方面，應保障合法者之產權，規定合理化之組金標準，使投資者樂於建築新屋，對建築新屋者亦屬加以獎勵，消級方面，則應儘速取消二房東制度，令三房客得直接與業主簽訂租約，則一切由二房東發生之爭執問題，自然消減。（四）應與法院及屬會取得連繫，以免隔閡分歧之弊，設以該項規則頭緒紛繁，不能修訂，則毋寗即予廢止，聽令民間自由訂約，而紀紛則由司法處理，以免政府有令出不行之議，人民有動　得咎之苦。</p>

<h3>修訂大學課程標準　教部正繼續研究進行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕敎部對小學課程標準之修訂，巳於前月在滬集專家開會，大體已定，不久可見諸實施，中學課程標準之修訂，在未復員以前，敎部已在渝開會，　有辦法，俟各校復員就緒，再由部約各地專家集會商討。聞大學課程標準之修訂，敎部亦正在繼續不斷的研究進行中，於文，理，法，師，四院課程之修訂，已至相當階段。復員之後，並與農，工，商，醫，各院課程，爲整個之修訂計畫。其修訂趨勢，在共同必修科之鐘點，爲適當之支配，對於學生之担負，使其輕减，淘减不必要科目之鐘點，增加學生課外生活之活動時間，以調劑其身心之發育，而大學一年級課程之支配，尤加注意。因鑒於收復區高中畢業生程度，未盡適合標準，而現在已令各大學及獨立學院皆辦大學先修班，使陷期不符水準，投考大學未能錄取之學生，有先修班可以進修，則大學課程新標準，自應將水準提高，凡程度較差學生，經入先修班之補習，自可與大學課程新標準相銜接，故大學一年級課程，酌量修訂，以避重複而免濫費云。（記者按：上海在陷期有租界時，江蘇省立各校在上海復課，以及上海有些著名中學，學生所習英，敎，理，化，高中最後階段，往往上大學上期程度之課本）。</p>

<p>組織委會　向校長清算</p>
<p>校長楊誠成未允，學生表示不滿，逐即組織清算委員會，實行對校長淸算　目，並將校長及敎職員行動，悉予監視。二十八日，復以全體學生名義，在皖北日報登載此事，指摘楊校長貪污，扣留實習費，强迫學生津貼敎師伙食費，盜賣學校磚石，以及上學期辦理報銷，僞造敎職員學生私章等情。校方本擬舉行大考，至是未能舉行。是日下午，在蚌之省舊學汪忠天，市政處敎育科長朱卓人，親往調處無效。據學生代表語記者：全校所有同學，現在不足一百五十人，分紡織科一班，土木工程科兩班，此事旣發生，希望各界主持正義，予以援助。惟據楊校長談：此事發生，實屬本校之不幸，學生儘管查賬，但希望不要將事態擴大。截至三十日，該校大門，仍由學生守候。敎員多己恢復自由，惟楊校長及事務員仍被監視，不能行使職權。敎員方面則希望和平解決，以便及早放假返里云。（超）</p>

<h3>對於外商公司登記　美商會長五項意見　在滬美商行現尚無確數可稽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃爲明瞭外商方面，對公司登記之意見計，特趨訪本市美國商會理事長潘德氏，承吿：自新公司法修正頒佈後，本市一般美商，極願向當局辦理登記註册手續，日美國商會於若干次會議中，各美商咸表願意準備登記。惟在準備登記過程中，仍有若干問題，深覺値得研究：（一）登記步驟，似嫌繁複。美商在美國應辦登記手續甚簡。且登記時應塡之各項徵信資料，亦無如此複雜蓋有若干徵信資料，在美商方面，認爲在營業上有保持其秘密性之必要，似未便填報。（二）徵收捐稅，無一定之標準。目前美商在滬經商，最大宗之支出，爲職工之薪津，次即爲應付之捐稅。目前所施行之捐稅制度，旣無標準，又嫌繁複，故亟望能簡化稽征步驟。（三）中美商約，迄未簽訂就緒。按該約對中美兩國間商務之經營，均有規定。故在未明該約內容前，中美兩方商界，對未來業務之開展，頗有無所適從之感。（四）美商在華經營，並無特殊之希望。極願與各方面合作，推進彼此間之貿易。故甚望我國各項法律之規定，勿過於嚴格，致反阻止正常商務之開展。渠稱：自美國於一九四三年聲明廢紫在華之領判權後，曾另訂中美友好條約。此項條約，曾規定係屬互惠性質。惟最近我國規定外人旅居內地時，仍須至各警局辦理加簽手續。然華人在美旅居各地，則並不需辦該項加簽手續。此舉對外商在華業務之開展，亦不無窒碍。（五）若干政府經營之事業，或其代理處，參預各項事業後，頗有獨佔之嫌。例如最近海關對若干輸入品，常臨時限止輸入。尤使外商經營，感覺萬分捉摸不定。再以商會之規定而言，中美亦有不同。社會局之規定，商會屬於公會性質。各會員對任何一會員之行動，均須負相當責任。美國則否。美國商會僅爲若干會員代表集會之機構。潘氏旋稱：美商現並不希望在法律上予美商以優惠之條件，惟望一切規定，對美商勿有所歧視。末復結論稱：以上種種，不過就顯而易見者，略舉數端而言。潘氏對外商目前處境之艱澀，雅不欲徒事訴苦。惟稱如關係當局有所諮詢時，當擬多多提供建設性之建議云。</p>
<p>記者旋以美商公司登記之事，詢諸中美工商業協進會駐華代表史密斯女士，據稱留華美商，自新公司法修正頒佈後，均紛紛準備辦理登記註册手續。有一部份且早已向我國經濟部註册。據估計，太平洋戰前美在滬之商行，約有百家左右。自日本屈膝後，美商有來滬復業者，惟亦有因業務一時無法開展而結束返國者。故美商行在滬之確數，刻尙在調查統計中。</p>
<p>按原文稱：社會局規定商會會員，對任何一會員之行動，均須負相當責任，美國則否云云，就吾人所知，社會局並無此規定，即中央法令中，亦無此規定，頗聞英美商人，因此曾向外交部作過一度聲訴，此項誤會，究不知如何發生也。</p>
<h3>銀根奇緊暗息高昂　金價被迫下跌　美鈔港票亦感虛怯</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初以隔前小銀樓飾金掛高，晨開會見二〇二萬，惟屬曇花一現，開後即被六底金融風潮所壓制，賣風轉盛，惟降至一九七萬以下後，一度微現穩定，中央配給二二五條，價一九七萬五，十時後尙無特變，無何銀根奇缺，暗息有喊高二角半至三角者，一時斬殺復起，午刻步跌至一九二萬以下，午後風波漸平，稍有轉機，回升至一九五萬，結果較封關前跌落三萬，飾金念萬〇六，紋銀二千元，暗拆以銀根混亂，暗息普通爲一角八至二角二分間。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔震慄於六底晚間缺頭襯各銀行，以一九〇〇元左右最低價殺出之恐慌，疲莫能興，自晨開二六四〇元左右逐步萎靡至二四八〇元，而後微穩，午刻隨金市稍有回升至二五五〇元左右盤旋，結果較上月底慘跌一百元，港票自五六〇元供過於求，結果亦跌四十元，港滙五五〇元，印滙六八〇元，英滙八千九，均吿混亂異常，美滙明平暗滯。</p>
<h3>中央行研商辦法　防範濫發空空頭支票</h3>
<p>自公債市塲慘落後，一般投機家多吿崩潰，不得已以空顯支票施其欺騙之行爲，邇來是類案件層見　出，京滬金融市塲揪起驚入大波，中央銀行爲安定金融市塲，正竭力設法防止中，聞已與財部主管方面切商具體辦法，加以限制，今後貼票一項，决根據票據法辦理，以免空頭支票，亦混入市塲，</p>
<h3>申請出口貨款式　審查極為嚴格</h3>
<p>中國銀行因戰後驗出業之不振，特舉辦出口貨貸款，並以持有海外國家進口證之廠商尤加鼓勵，予以低利貸款，聞自上項消息透露以來，前往申請者頗爲踴躍，該行爲使貸款用於正當用途起見，對於上項申請貸款者，事前詳加審查，事後並須隨時予以調查。</p>
<h3>公債平淡</h3>
<p>公價極爲平穩，逢低仍有少數好奇心之收買，空方亦補，惟交易仍　零散居多，統丙祗有三十元起仆，結果與封關前相較，稍見微升，甲乙丁戊亦回升少許。</p>
<h3>六底餘波蕩漾　多頭紛紛脫手　華洋股均慘跌</h3>
<p>華股迫於金融風潮緊急，斬多慘烈，各股除美亞因慘跌過度，低價見二四〇〇元後，得以回穩，餘者均以低價結束，冷門中小型亦被帶小，惟中法有人維持，所跌有限，午刻疲後轉盤，結果較封關前計永紗等五熱門各跌二成左右，冷門中小型除中法所跌尙微外，餘者則下挫一成左右，元老股亦被帶小若干。</p>
<p>外股亦被捲入漩渦，各股都被斬多所包圍，怡紗上塲即慘跌一一千元强，降至八六〇〇元，開後繼續見怯，惟低價漸多維持，午刻吿盤，結果較封關前，計怡紗紙業跌一成半，英聯業廣怡啤跌一成，會德豐跌一成弱，亞洲鋼業所跌有限。</p>

<h3>泉泡圓產價升</h3>

<h3>上半年度結算　銀行獲利頗多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金融消息：本年度上半年上海各銀行結算，經己完竣，商業銀行率皆獲有盈餘，最高盈餘額有達五億元以上者，最低亦在五千萬元左右。各銀行之所以獲利，多數係從事投機　業者，是以並不能決定今後上海金融市塲之前途。</p>
<h3>銀根抽緊·金價小回　紗花布同時低落</h3>
<p>昨日紗市突轉下游，　金融界銀根抽緊，金價四入二百萬關內，紗價亦因是而一蹶不振，晨初開市即見大衆賣出，受者寥寥，同行求售心切，價乃逐步降落，以雙馬及四十二支雙股圓落最多，較六底前約跌十萬，其餘廿支中小型約小三四萬，午時紡建照例開紗，價亦隨市貶低</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊跌卅一至四十四磅音，計近期美金三一·〇七，建期三一·二六，米特林現貨三一·七六，本埠現棉交易平淡，緣美棉與紗價　跌，廠家與花高不無觀望，僅南通大生紗廠進彭家坡四百包，價做九萬五至九萬八，此外各廠未有採辦。</p>
<p>布市因銀根緊迫，且傳銀行有數家擱淺，於是人心大挫，浮多急於吐出，同時馬路水溢，市塲集會者寥寥，成交殊清V龍頭　嘰疲二百五十元，惟一般搶　子浮貨斬結，跌七百五十元，午後平。</p>
<h3>糧價審議委員會　本週內可正式成立　負責評定本市米價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自第四次糧食會議決定組織糧價審議委員會後，業經規定由社會局，豆米行業，米號業各派代表二人，糧食部總倉庫，及經售米糧業各派代表一人，參加組織，而由社會局主持，據悉：該會之組織規程，至遲一二日內，即可起草完畢，該會亦可望於本週內正式成立，該會成立後，將參酌各產區之米價，及糧商採辦來滬時所應支出之各項開支，加上糧商之合法利潤，然後評定一公平價格，俾便鼓勵米商自動赴各產區購辦米糧來滬，同時可使本市黑市米價趨於消滅云。</p>
<h3>南北米市開業　塲內交易無多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米業南北兩市塲，昨日九時起，正式開始營業，南市塲在民國路三七七號三樓，主要負責人有邱福祥，朱永明等，北市塲在庫倫路二一二號，主要負責人有黃進賢，顧益生等，兩市塲今雖正式開始營業，惟到塲米商不多，交易散淡，申請配給之米號（速前已申請而未獲配給者）共三〇三家，昨日共配出廿八家，預計今日可大批配出，據聞：此後營業，每逢星期一三五等日，將偏重於南市塲，每逢二四六等日，則偏重於北市塲云。</p>

<h3>白銀不值得崇拜　美議員反對提高價格</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約三日電〕紐約州國會議員施雷，頃爲答復最近柯羅拉多州採鑛公會發表之白銀宣傳起見，特爲文致紐約時報稱：目下「白銀派」要求將銀價由七一·一一，提到九〇·五分，二年後，再提至一·二九元一事，實無任何理由，蓋現下之銀價，業已過高，而白銀已不再用作貨幣之準備，再則白銀原爲銅鉛之副產品，故白銀法案，要不過爲此等金屬之附屬條款而已，施氏復稱，將來終有一日，白銀不再被人當作神聖之物，而加以崇拜，白銀眞値，遠較政府之付價爲低，故繼續此種自銀利益之誇大宣傳，實屬荒謬絕倫。</p>

<h3>病滯北平的白魯德將軍</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯稿</p>
<p>如果有一天中國的內戰停止，而走上了和平繁榮的建國之路，那末，其中有很大部分的功績，該歸給這位三十二歲的年輕准將，現在正患傷寒，臥病在北平海軍醫院裏的白魯德將軍。</p>
<p>辛勤工作　涉水步行</p>
<p>他自去年十二月間到達重慶，担任美國大使館的武官以來，就日以繼夜地辛勤工作。他曾脫了衣服，在冷如寒冰的　河中涉水步行，爲了要去視察鄕間的小衝突。他曾駕了吉普車，在世界上最崎嶇難行的路面上顚簸駛行數百哩。他從中國的這一角飛到那一端，爲衝突中的國共將領排難解紛。他辯訴，墾求，說情，發　。務必要使雙方漸漸得到同意的協定。</p>
<p>面紅耳赤　言歸於好</p>
<p>有一次，在瀋陽，共黨的饒漱石將軍和政府軍的趙家驤參謀長，爲了一件事吵到了面紅耳赤，不可開交，這位「少年准將」連忙出來調解，把他倆請到浴室裏，三個人在浴缸裏玩一只小玩具船，直到他們十分高興，言歸於好。</p>
<p>滿腔熱情　締造機塲</p>
<p>白魯德准將，到今年七月廿四日，正滿三十三歲。他是印第安那州人，一九三七年從軍官學校畢業以後，一九四〇年在康納爾大學得工程學碩士學位。不久，他就被派到中印緬戰區來建造空軍基地。他在華西建築了B29式超級堡壘的機塲。他惟一的工具，只是地圖上的一點鉛筆記號，一腔過人的精力，和幾句學來的本地話。就這樣地，他把機塲造了起來。</p>
<p>追隨馬帥　參加談判</p>
<p>一九四四年他回到華盛頓，然後又跟馬歇爾元帥重回中國。他參加了許多次最複雜棘手的談判，達到了一月十日的停戰協定。幾天以後，他担任了軍事調處執行部的主任。重慶的政治空氣不久又見惡化，中國似乎又瀕於分裂的前夕了，白魯德將軍竭盡全力，設法把這個分裂的國家團結到一起。</p>
<p>每日工作　十六小時</p>
<p>他飛往窮鄉僻壤的地方，在飛鳥停下來也得小心翼翼的蹩腳機塲上辛苦降落，竭力使衝突的國共將領們言歸於好。他開了吉普，在亂石嶙峋的路上奔波，爲了想找到適當的人來談判。在北平時，他一日工作十六小時，爲了想使衝突的雙方實行停戰協定。他又時常飛去南京，和馬歇爾元帥會商，給這個工作緊張的總部帶來一陣新鮮的氣息。</p>
<p>中原旅行　辛苦備嘗</p>
<p>白魯德將軍所作最辛苦的旅行之一，就是他有一次和徐永昌及周恩來將軍飛到漢口，視察共黨所控訴的國軍圍殲中原數千共軍的事件。從漢口出發到調查地點有八十哩路——走了三天。路壞透了。傾盆的大雨冲毀了所有的橋樑。河水漲得很高，白魯德指揮了臨時雇來的工人，用竹槓把吉普抬了，打河裏涉水過去，水沒到每個人的頭頸——白魯德自然也在內。事情結束以後，他回到南京，自己駕着一架小運輸機，降落的時候撞了一大下，使機場上的人都揑了一把冷汗，飛機跳起了四十呎高，但白魯德走下機來，笑容滿面，手裏握着雙方簽了字的協定，然後就是去參加一連串煩難的會議，在馬歇爾元帥，周恩來，和蔣主席之間來回奔走。白魯德是瘦了，面容憔悴，但是他仍然以一向充沛的精力工作着。</p>
<p>飛赴長春　調停戰事</p>
<p>他飛到長春，担任軍事調處執行部先遣小組的組長，準備調停在東北的戰事。他逗留了很久，然後又回到北平，把一個蛀牙拔了。在那時候，他工作過度得已十分疲累了。醫生勸他該在醫院裏休養一個較長的時間，但他拒絕了，帶着新的指示和新的希望，又重回到了長春。</p>
<p>在長春，白魯德的身體突然發了高度的熱，便回到北平。據說他害的是傷寒，但還沒有完全斷定。但有一件事是每個人都很清楚了的：他是爲了求取中國國內的和平，而損傷了自己的健康。（合衆社，六，卅日）</p>

<p>租房被非法强佔</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是抗戰前住在庫倫路一八二號一個房客，在敵僞時間，被日人強佔，但勝利以後，又被非法軍人強佔。該處房子，由中央信託局發還業主業廣公司，歸民人居住。敝人因戰前老房客，故有優先權，租得該路一八二號。現在被軍政部福利社理髮部強佔。但該理發部，並非軍界所經營，乃是民人邱志富與福利社郭某勾結，假借名義。敝人請求行政院上海各機關房屋分配會，呈請三次，該會派員調查已五次，至今多日，一無批示。該處房金水電及煤汽等各費，每月由敝人　付。請問諸員，是否不付房金者可住，付者不能居住，　否此理？請房屋分配委員會即日主持公道，發還民人居住。　錫　啓。廿九日</p>
<p>學生領不　奶粉</p>
<p>編輯先生：我們是在南市大南門私立景瑞小學附設民校求學。聽說民校的學生也有奶粉配給高高興興的拿了盛器去領取。誰知上課時先生對我們訓話，「你們這樣大了，還吃什麼奶粉」！同學們面面相覷，也不敢多說。我們想到民校同學很多，每人兩磅爲數可觀，名義上是我們領取，實際完全給校方拿去，自然心有不甘。請敎育局和善後救濟總署上海分署，把這許多被吞沒的奶粉查出來，救濟蘇北難民。學生張自強，王文照等謹啓。</p>

<p>第一步驟，各軍均裁减三分之一，即原三師九團之軍縮編爲三旅之師，原二師六團之軍縮編爲二旅四團之師，各獨立師一律改編爲二團制之獨立旅，第二步驟照軍事三人小組所簽訂之基本方案實施，但九十個師按規定編制編成後應逐次編爲三十個軍，每軍轄二師，並照基本方案所規定，逐次導入應配置之位置。上述第一步驟之　編工作，並分爲三期實施，第一期整編，隴海沿綫及西北部隊（新疆河西除外）共二十七個軍，六十六個師，自三月開始，至四月底完成；第二期整編長江流域及長江以南部隊共三十二個軍，九十二個師，自五月一日開始，至六月底完成；第三期自七月一日開始，其計劃業已擬定。一俟上述第一步驟之整編完成後，即繼續實施第二步驟之整編。其辦法如下：各步兵師均按照正式編制，整編步兵爲九十個師，每師兩旅四團，共一萬四千人，每軍部直屬部隊約六千三百人，各軍師整編開始日期，須由調處執行部規定，其軍師編制另定之。各師原存三旅六團制者，調整爲二旅四團制之師，華北方面共計七個軍，須於本年九月一日以前，按照規定編制，先編成一個軍，俾與中共部隊在第七個月（即本年九月）統編爲集團軍，其他六個軍則可稍後分別編成，並指定兩個或三個軍，與中共部隊統編爲集團軍。惟尙有二點須附帶說明即：（一）第一二期的整編，所有軍縮編爲師，師縮編爲旅，以後原有直屬部隊，除少數取銷外，餘均保留，如每師已取銷一團及輸送連，則同時新成立三個搜索排。（二）第三期的整編計劃雖已擬定，嗣因中共部隊並未遵照停戰協定，到處發動攻勢，造成國內混亂，致事實上無法實施。</p>
<p>（二）敵寇的遣送：中國境內（東北除外）越北在內之日俘日僑，共計二百萬餘人，於去年十月廿五在上海召集中美聯合會議决定遣送回國計劃，及調用日本船隻若干自十一月十五日開始輸送。决定使用之港口，爲塘沽，青島，連雲港，上海，廣州，海口，汕頭，廈門，海防，基隆，高雄等十一處。內地日俘僑　後動總部　　輸送至各港口。至於各　口設立運輸司令部，負責處理日俘僑上船時之檢查諸事宜，被遣送返國之日俘僑，准其携帶日幣平民一千元，軍官五百元，士兵二百元，及其衣服與個人用具，如超過規定，及有違禁物品者，則予沒收，由中國政府保存，作爲將來賠償戰費之一部，各地之日俘僑統限於七月十五日以前，全部遣送完畢，截至六月底止，計已遣送回國者共達一百九十五萬人以上</p>
<p>（三）敵僞軍品的收繳與處理計劃，分全國爲十個收繳區，（京滬，武漢，平津，膠濟，越南，廣州，開封，香港，台灣，東北）各派一特派員辦理其事，各區已於本年三月底次第接收完畢，並另派遣三個騐收委員會分區騐收，現尙在進行中。至敵僞軍品之利用，早經策訂計劃，逐步實施。凡屬補給性質者，如糧彈燃料等，依照規定就近補給，部隊凡屬補充性質者，如武器被服及各種器材，依部隊需要予以撥補。凡屬充實編配者，如戰車汽車馬匹等，分別充實部隊，凡屬軍用工廠原料者，工廠提早次第開工，從事生產，原料統籌分配利用。（未完）</p>
<p>第三，吾國政府在大戰以後百廢待舉，本市公用事業，外人的投資，似可不必急急由政府收回，要知吾們如有此一筆龐大資金，正可應用於其他更重要的建設上，或舉辦吾們沒有興辦的市政建設。而且接收的空氣一經宣傳，對於外人投資中國　　　上，也不免發生很大的反　　吾以爲很應當鄭重。</p>
<p>依據上述，本人認爲外商有成績的公司，似應予以維持，即給以合理利潤：惟宜與華商公司適宜配合，俾得互相合作，最好能實行合併，使一種事業，由一個公司經營，同屬上海市民，有同等享受之權利與義務，同時正可利用各公司訓練管理和技術的人才，以備建設國營公用事業的準備。</p>
<p>以下再報告三十五年一月至六月改進的情形及將來的計劃。同時因上海水電煤氣及交通工具都在缺乏之中，所以不能不標本兼治。</p>
<h3>給水方面</h3>
<p>飲水爲市民公共衛生的基礎，本局於今年一月間邀集衛生局及各自來水廠代表，商定飲水標準，其主要點以一公升水樣中大腸菌不得超過十個，又總硬度不得超過三〇〇。現在照此規定執行，據四月份統計，全月製水量爲一千一百七十四萬立方公尺（合二十六萬八千二百八十萬加侖）售水量爲七百十五萬立方公尺（合十五萬萬七千三百萬加侖）以全市人口三百五十萬人計，平均每人每日用水量約爲十五加侖。較諸十二月本市每人平均用水量每日八，二加侖，有顯著之進步，因爲六月份用水量因天熱還需增高，所以用四月份作爲代表。如果能改良設備，使製水量得以充分運用，則平均每人每日用水量可提高至二十加侖以上。</p>
<p>不過在滬西一帶，自來水的設置向不普遍，現在時交夏令，飲水衛生，更見重要。本局對於解決這一問題，早經準備恢復戰前的給水站，惟水管的整理和補充，以及水表的裝置，一則需用大量款項，二則需經相當時日，不能應目前之急。因此再擬訂舉辦自來水零售辦法，經常售給區內市民應用。又恐不易普遍，再於各平民區域每日規定時間開放公共龍頭，免費供給以資救濟。</p>
<p>至於治本計劃，大略如次：</p>
<p>上海現有自來水公司共五家，各公司幹支管綫，幾及整個熱鬧市區，惟滬西方面，獨付缺如。在舊越界築路一帶，以前雖由英商自來水公司接管供給，但該處距英商水廠太遠，（約十五公里）且管徑太小，（二吋至六吋）致壓力低至十五呎以下，（標準壓力應在三十呎至五十呎）未能充分供應。戰前市政府爲澈底解決滬西給水問題起見，曾主張用中外合資方式，設立一滬西自來水公司，在龍華以南，黃浦江上游成立一新水廠，以謀全盤解決。當時商討已有相當進展，適因八一三戰事爆發，就此擱置，目前本局正在接洽進行，以期從速實現。</p>
<p>滬西自來水公司成立以後，全滬自來水供應網，（Water　Suply　Grid）大致可以完成使各公司專營區域之間，設法將水管聯接，使彼此之間，脉絡貫通，遇有緊急需要時，可以互相供應，這樣全滬雖有六個公司，實際無異一個機構，全市健全的給水網，至此方吿完成。</p>
<p>至於現有各公司水廠之分布，以及專營區域之劃分，當不免有種種不合理的地方。彼此機力管綫之運用，很不經濟，但此種種，均有專營合約的拘束，須相機徐謀合理調整。（待續）</p>

<h3>揚州人念念不忘飛將軍　邀董明德敬勝利之酒　盼空軍同僚探吿董君現狀以慰衆望</h3>
<p>編者先生：請恕我不說客氣話了。在抗戰初期，駐在我們揚州的空軍，大槪是第五大隊吧，有一位抗敵的英雄董明德隊長先生，他給我們揚州人的印象，是太深刻了！因爲有一次，三架敵機，來空襲我們的揚州飛機塲，經過二小時的激戰，均經這位抗敵的英雄董隊長一一的掃蕩擊落了。這一次的戰果，不但給予敵人致命的打擊，而且振奮了人民抗戰必勝的信心，揚州雖是京滬一帶空軍的根據地，敵機却因着董隊長的英勇，從經胆怯，再也不敢來犯了。揚州不再遭受空襲的痛苦，平心而論，都完全是董隊長的英勇所賜予。其後京滬淪陷，揚州的空軍，當亦隨之後撤，後來在報紙上，又看見董隊長追擊敵機在江陰上空，單人獨馬，殺入敵陣，又被擊落數架的消息以後，國軍繼續西撤，這董隊長的英名就漸漸的與揚州的人民疏遠了。現在抗戰勝利，日月重光了，在這抗戰八年間，我敢說一句，沒有一個揚州人，不掛念着這位英雄的安全和健康；沒有一個揚州人，不希望這位英雄，能够以揚州來一趟；接受我們的歡呼和致敬。最起碼，也得來和我們，乾一杯勝利之酒。可是我們不知道，這位英雄現在的下落，所以才寫信來給貴報，賜予刊載，和設法代向空軍機關，探詢英雄的下落，這一點點的愚忱，我想貴報總不會使我們揚州十萬人失望吧，表示愼重起見，由掛號寄奉，耑此奉懇，即請撰安　劉中和敬上</p>
<p>〔編者按〕這　尋人的文稿，誠摯懇切，熱情奔放，感人至深！自當樂予發表。董君忠勇抗戰功在黨國，令人肅然起敬！近狀如何？盼速賜吿，如董君不在本埠，請空軍同僚轉吿行踪，由本欄代轉便是。</p>

<h3>記司徒喬戰災畫展</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>天空陰雲密佈，我匆忙地從家裏出來，坐電車趕到八仙橋青年會，去看　城司徒喬先生的粵桂湘鄂豫五省戰災畫展。幸虧還好，到了三樓，外面方纔大雨滂沱，就在這樣陰晦的雨天觀看司徒喬的畫，——這人間地獄的巡歷。</p>
<p>很高興地遇見司徒喬先生，一把長鬍子，突出的眼珠，頗像外國的傳敎士。的確他該是一個牧師。他有豐子愷那樣地悲天憫人的胸懷，子愷也是一把長鬍子。後來他又介紹他的妻子伊　給我，我讀了她許多首極好的題畫詩。他們倆眞是一對理想的伴侶，像宋代的趙明誠和李清照。</p>
<p>雖然只有八十幅畫，但因內容充實，看了一遍，我的腿就乏力了。很早我就欣賞過司徒喬的畫，十多年前，北新書局很多的文藝畫都是由他與陶元慶兩位作封面畫的。這一次的畫展更使我愉悅於他那高妙的藝術技巧和他對於人生理解的透切準確。聽說這畫展要開到七號爲止。</p>
<p>這畫展給了我一個啓示：戰爭委實太可怕了。試看「空室鬼影圖」那樣可怕的全家餓死的慘象，誰看了也要驚心怵目。我就突的心被拎了起來，骨瘦得像骷髏一般的母親，還有那吃草根樹皮脹大了肚皮而死的孩子，無怪乎作者要揮淚而畫了。他如全州餓民圖，流氓圖，逃荒者，待哺，餓殍，曝背圖，　車，啃野草等等，都說明了人民飢饉這一方面，戰爭使得人們妻離子散，戰爭使得人們飢餓而死。但另一方面却又有高樓大廈中享樂的人，故餓殍題杜少陵詩句云：「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨。」伊湄題船娘云：「睛搖月，雨搖風，畫搖悉，夜搖夢，搖不掉　寒，搖不脫貧窮，米價苦昂捐苦重！」</p>
<p>戰爭可怕的另一面是工程與工業的被破壞。例如河南鄭州豫豐紗廠殘址，淥口鐵橋，桂林紡織廠遺址，南軒圖書館遺址，柳州車站等。還有蒸溜間變成一片瓦礫，寫的是柳州酒精廠，　容橋寫的是敵人進攻，我們只好炸燬鐵橋，但正在渡橋的我軍不及撤退，轟然一聲，便都血肉橫飛。一方面我們又看到重建，重建家園，炸燬與重建，重建中之梧州等幅。是的，重建兩字屢次在畫題中看到，足見作者是多末殷切地盼望新中國能够建設起來。抗戰以後該是建國，老百姓在受過外侮以後，實在再經不起內戰了！我希望國共雙方能够和衷共濟地一同建設新中國。</p>
<p>試看國殤圖，郝夢麟，張自忠，謝晋元，　海文，趙侗諸將軍義士都在昭示我們，要我們好好地重整這破碎的河山。他們瞪大着白眼盼望我們能够不辜負他們這些犧牲者，我相信，他們的熱血是還在地下沸騰着的。</p>
<p>請再看「化干戈爲耒　」吧。我們現在所需要是這個。田園將蕪，工業區成爲廢墟，難道不會喘氣，就要再來一次戰爭麼？倘若再打，其慘况當尙不止此，我不忍想像下去。</p>
<p>沫若乃超以　邵瓊都來看畫，天已經晴了，陽光照滿了畫室，我祝　而且希望這是光明的預兆！</p>
<h3>短簡</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>因爲家的催促，你要匆匆走了，當我送你行時，那天是多　的早上；江畔只有我們兩個人，我們慢慢地走，起初，我們像　　在江上的霧一般沉默着，久久低下頭，彼此不說一句話，後來我因爲忍不住沉閟的壓迫，終於問你：「你愛彬嗎？」</p>
<p>你望着我許久，才像十分堅決般說：</p>
<p>「這半年來的生活，除了你和彬能了解我之外，雖然在衆多的人　間，也沒有人再能了解我，帮助我。」於是你又低下頭說：「他是那麼的誠懇，熱情，樂助他人……我愛他。」</p>
<p>我相信你，因爲你是一個天眞純良的女孩子。但是，當你臨行時，彬老是躺着，睜着可怕的眼睛，癡癡地望着天花板，我叫他起來一同出去送你走，可是他稱病；我幾次要求，他終拒絕了。由於他神態的苦惱，我不放心，也疑慮着隱藏在你們中間的暗影，所以當我獨自送你走時，除了簡單的問你一聲之後，我便不再說話了。只有你會隱　着後面的騙局，而我也無法　去那隱憂；心如累贅的鉛塊，往下沉墜。我送你走了回來，彬也不對我說什麼，我保存着像等候一個難測的謎底，讓它有一天能够自動的揭破。</p>
<p>是你走後的一個星期日了，因爲久失去了你的笑聲和歌聲，宿舍四週更杳然無聲了；房間裏只有我和彬兩人相對默坐，傾聽着窗外的雨聲，風聲，一點說話的心情都沒有。我還好，不過心中孤寂一點而已，彬的心却難於言說了。外面的綠樹，以前是我們談天，和裝鬼臉嬉玩的地方，現在就像一叢原始的森林，埋伏着神秘，潛藏着恐怖。</p>
<p>昨天一天他只是躺在牀上，直挺挺的，兩眼習慣地發呆，望着窗外鐵網一般的陰沉天幕。他像預料到什麼可怕的變故將要來臨似的，不言不語也不笑。我想找話來安慰他，但有什麼話有那樣神效呢？他先把自己的「談判之門」閉得緊緊的，使我沒有開口的勇氣，即使有千萬的同情，慰藉之語，也無從出口。一個長長的寂靜的下午，就這樣我們兩個人默然相對；我的眼睛呆望着他，他的眼睛呆望着窗子外面的一方天。夜來了，　黑暗佔據了我們的房間很久後，我才去開亮了電燈，慘淡的光綫照射着我們，我幾乎忍不住要流下淚水。</p>
<p>「彬！你不放心嗎？」</p>
<p>「她走時還說愛你。」</p>
<p>「怎麼？是眞的病了？」</p>
<p>我沒有望他，只悶着追問下去，除聽見　側輾動的床聲外，沒有人答覆我，我受着夜靡主宰了一切。</p>
<p>今天，一清早志鄧飄然的挾着送來了兩封喜帖，我驚喜着折開那鮮紅的封套，拉出看裏面摺疊着的美麗粉紅色的紙帖。喲！我不敢相信，上面印着的就是你的名字，在你名字旁邊的，就是你常稱作「大哥」的明，這不是對誠實的一個絕大無情的戲謔嗎？是難測的謎底，已經揭破了？</p>
<p>彬一手抓佔了紅帖子，他好像就跌入絕望的深淵裏去了；他想什麼？他悔呢？還是恨呢？誰知道，誰能說。屠格捏夫在「貴族之家」最後一節寫着，麗莎的眼睫毛幾乎不可見地震顫着，可是我已瞧見他的眼睫毛在顫動，見他掙扎，呻吟，整個靈魂都在抖索，在爆炸，在煙滅。……剎那間，那兩個紅帖子的外套就豁拉一聲撕得粉碎了。但那兩張粉紅色的紙帖，却沒有撕，做了一個要撕的姿勢，就突然不自覺地倒下床裏去了。</p>
<p>我退回我的床邊，暗嘆着：「侯門一入深似海，從此蕭郞是路人。」的古詩。我想不到一個女孩子，竟騙了一個忠心，誠實，熱情與和愛的人！我恨，恨誠實與欺騙這兩個極端的東西，不斷地在揶揄人生！</p>
<p>本來我不應該說這樣的話，可是事實逼着我說出來了，請你原諒，你是知道的，因爲我和彬都是窮孩子，沒有辦法給你送禮，同時，彬叫我不要離開他，也不能離開這裏，所以不能去祝賀你的盛典了。</p>
<p>你過去常說我是一個在女孩子的面前就變成怯弱和不大方的孩子。我承認你這句話，尤其在目前，我更確信了這句話的正確性。現在，就讓這怯弱的孩子，向你們獻呈一些靦腆的致意吧！</p>
<h3>苦悶篇（五）</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>環境的苦悶</p>
<p>好久以來，環境就成了一個怨府。誰有些不開心，怨環境；失敗了，吃虧了，怨環境；甚至子弟不上進，男盜女娼，道德墮落，一切罪惡的滋生，也都怨環境。環境如果是一個生物，將主動被人殺死，否則也將在大衆指謫之下，活活氣死。環境做了出氣筒，贖罪的羔羊。環境有知，定會放聲一哭！</p>
<p>但環境究竟是什麼東西呢？環境沒有口，不會自己分辯，自己解釋。環境如有口，牠一定會說，種種罪惡，並不是牠幹的，是駡牠的人本身所幹的。牠本來不存在，駡牠的人造成了牠，又幹了種種罪惡，而歸之於牠。如果牠是一個生物，牠一定懂得這個道理，也一定會感到苦悶。</p>
<p>况且，環境也正像一個有機體，牠在不斷地前進，向上，將古今的歷史一比較，就可以知道。然而有些人却偏偏不願意牠前進，向上，要牠落後倒退。牠前進一步，甚至有人會拉牠後退二步。牠不掙扎，永遠在掙扎，掙扎着向前上進。牠如此努力，還不能被諒解於人，人一味怨怪牠，牠尤其覺得苦悶。</p>
<p>人們不肯使牠成爲一個繁榮出版者的環境，出版者要怨怪牠，牠實在不能　　。爲什麼自私自利的人這樣多，要弄得物價高漲，民不聊生，以致出版的成本　到了空前的高度呢？牠不但願意出版者可以有出版的便利，更願意出版者會俯就編輯者的意見，而出版好的刊物，也就是願意寫作者會寫作好的東西，而使讀者讀到好的精神食糧。牠一肚子的悲天憫人，却不爲人所諒解，而所得的，只是怨怪，牠不能免於苦悶！</p>
<p>牠尤其明白，要自私自利的人少，以致沒有，敎育是一個最大的工具。而敎育的門類中，出版佔了很重要的地位。牠希望牠成爲完美的環境，適宜於人類的生存，而就從出版入手，現在却有那樣澈底自私自利的少數人，把持了一切，搗亂了一切，破壞了一切，使牠不得改良，不適宜於人類的生存，而還要歸罪於牠，天下的冤屈，沒有比這個再大的了！牠於苦悶之餘，簡直無辭以解，百　莫贖！</p>
<p>不過，於此，我們也就可以明白，環境爲目前一切事故的總樞紐。我們必須解除了環境的苦悶，才能够說其他一切苦悶的解除，也惟有環境的苦悶解除了，其他一切苦悶隨同解除了，我們最原始的讀者，才會有正當的精神食糧，可以享受。</p>
<p>擒賊先擒王，我們必須努力解除環境的苦悶，否則枝枝節節，我們永遠不會有一個合理的生活，更不必說正當的精神食糧！</p>
<h3>築壩去</h3>
<p>— 阿揚刻</p>
<h3>讀王進珊先生畫</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>中國繪畫發展到唐代曾因爲印度文化的影響而起了本質上的變化，結果畫家有意無意地成爲印度哲學的說敎者，畫家的意識形態或多或少地蒙上一層玄學的色彩；就題材方面說：取材於佛經裏的故事和人物底作品也開始占到一個很大的比數。近百年來，中國傳統的文化由於本身的衰老和貧乏，亟需獲得新的生命，飽和吸收了西方文化；作爲文化主要部門的繪畫當然也不能例外，一般優秀的畫家遂開始靈活應用西方的手法，即使是最典型的國畫，也往往含蓄着馬蒂斯的風格，或者畢卡索的風格。</p>
<p>進珊先生對國畫有着高度的修養，尤其能批判地接受歷代的遺產，對一般學術也有普遍而深入的接觸，這種種條件使他的繪畫昇華到藝術的境界。</p>
<p>關於觀音大士和羅漢的造像，進珊先生的筆是非常練熟而有力的，竟使我們感覺到：彷彿這些神靈並不是虛無飄渺的，而是我們習見常聞的眞實的存在，和我們同樣是大千世界芸芸衆生之一。晚近努力釋道的畫家如張大千，張衡，雷震他們，大都在燉煌壁畫或大足石刻上面用臨摹的苦工，進珊先生則比較地憑主觀的想像去創作，包孕較多的寫意的成份，他們同樣得到輝煌的成就，眞是所謂「到羅馬去的路不止一條」。</p>
<p>「重巒疊嶂」「峽流帆影」「溪澗小橋」這幾幅山水，都是寫的蜀中景物，我在蜀中曾度過一串悠長的歲月，東來以後，無時不在眷念那一片豐饒的赤色盆地，當我凝視着畫面上的一泓清澈的江水，一個在迷濛的白霧裏若隱若現的山峯，恍如故友重逢，有說不出的喜悅，說不出的親切之感。</p>
<p>我是繪畫的愛好者，但是缺乏欣賞的能力理解的能力，偶而寫些批評文字，總不免近於隔靴搔癢，進珊先生是我多年畏友，諒必不會見怪我的淺薄，爰以展覽會上所得的印像和感想記之如上。</p>
<p>長篇連載</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（七四）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>激於同情，麗華常常去看望石玉樓。她過去對石玉樓的印象是　糊的，淡漠的。也因爲他們的性格都是緘默的原故，他們平時很少講話，因此一直沒有發生較深的友誼。可是，麗華在她的環境裏面的一些人中，比較起來，還是對石玉樓有些好感。特別是石玉樓瘋了以後，她更覺得石玉樓可憐，她可憐石玉樓，就像她可憐她自己一樣。</p>
<p>石玉樓其實是病了！神智依然不大清楚。而且咳嗽得很厲害，還不斷吐血。他已經蒼老得不成樣了！大夫說是癆症，要多吃補品滋養。可是這是辦不到的，他的經濟　能維持他和翁二太太的生活，加上鴉片花消，他已經是負債了，如何還有力量治病，補身體？翁二太太爲了他，近來在公寓裏包了些客人的衣服洗。此外，就　墨太太接濟接濟。（墨太太始終對翁二太太不壞，同時她爲了報答石玉樓敎過壩華的戲。）石玉樓對於翁二太太這種肯爲他吃苦的精神衷心也很感激，但有時又不免厭煩！他覺着不是有翁二太太的牽制，他還可以輕鬆些，至少他可以再跑跑碼頭。他一個人總是比較容易混，而多一個人，他的行動就不能够自由。一想到這裏，他就後悔不該從荊州把翁二太太帶出來，他怨自己沒有自知之明，沒有想到他會有潦倒的這一天。</p>
<p>一個把戲當作了第一生命的優伶，如果有一天他的「戲」完了，他的一切也都完了。石玉樓的瘋，就是由此而起！他傷心他唱了將近三十年的戲，而一旦因爲身體不濟，偶然砸了，便會被觀衆毫不留情地將他已往三十年的燦爛歷史全部推翻！這是多麼殘酷的打擊！同時又是多麼地令他不服！他想「東山再起」，可是他算了算自己的年紀，已經是四十歲的人了，無論如何也唱不過一個年青，漂亮的人。於是他悲哀！他怨尤！他咀咒！</p>
<p>有一天，麗華來看石玉樓，給他帶了一包「大前門」的香烟，（這是她經常送石玉樓的禮物。）石玉樓吸着烟，突破以往的沉默，拉着麗華的手說：</p>
<h3>鈍賊</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>偶閱顧亭林日知錄，在這裏面他說：「有明一代之人，其所著書無非竊盜而已。……今代之人，但有薄行而無　才，不能通作者之意。其竊盜所成之書必不如原本，名爲鈍賊何辭？」目前的中國出版界使我們和亭林先生發生同感，甚至於恐怕連這樣的鈍賊也不可多得了。</p>
<p>我　把中國的近著分成三類：第一類是剽竊抄襲，而成的。把外國人的東西，東抄一段，西抄一段，「編譯」成書，其中頗多「不通作者之意」的「鈍賊」。所成之書往往是詰屈　牙，不能卒讀。第二類是把東西各家著作熟讀消化之後，加以申述。這是「述而不作」。說來頭頭是道，引人入勝。第三類是眞正成熟的作品，是可以「成一家之言」的創造。這是作者多年的思慮體騐或實騐研究的結晶。在現在中國的出版界中第一類的書可以看到不少，第二類的書已經是鳳毛麟角，第三類簡直是絕無僅有了。</p>
<p>這三類的書還可以表示學術發展的三個階段。從個人的進步而論，初寫文章多是剽竊，繼而是述而不作，再進一步便能創造。所以我以爲不怕剽竊，就怕永久剽竊而不進步。以整個文化進展而論，初期是模倣，其次是消化，最後纔能創造。從中國近來出版物的分析中看起來中國自與西洋文化接觸之後，至今還未到創造的階段，我們似乎是進步得太慢了。從事於學術的人們能不猛省？</p>
<h3>貝多芬傳</h3>
<p>— 朱力　羅曼羅蘭著　傅雷譯</p>
<p>上海駱駝書店　三十五年四月初版</p>
<p>貝多芬有一句豪語：「用痛苦換來的歡樂」。（一八一五年十月十日致愛爾杜第夫人書）這句豪語，可以說明他的一生：一個不幸的人，貧窮，殘廢，孤獨，由痛苦造成的人，創造了歡樂來給予世界。</p>
<p>魯特維克·范·貝多芬，一七七〇年十二月十六日生於科隆附近的篷恩，一所破舊屋子的擱樓上。他的出身是弗拉芒族，父親是一個不聰明而酗酒的男高音歌手，母親是女仆。他是和不幸作伴的，人生於他是一塲悲慘而殘暴的鬥爭。貝多芬的童年是在悲慘中過去的，母親早死，父親酗酒，十七歲，他就做了一家之主，負着兩個兄弟的敎育之責。大革命爆發，汜濫全歐，佔據了貝多芬的心。篷恩大學是新思想的集中點，一七八九年五月十四日貝多芬報名入學。一七九二年十一月，戰事蔓延到篷恩，貝多芬便到維也納去。他的音樂上的造詣漸漸提高，同時他的信念更堅定，他說：「我的藝術應當使可憐的人得益」。不幸的事接踵而來，一七九六至一八〇〇年間，耳聾已開始它的酷刑。起初，貝多芬竭力隱忍着，但是，不可能了，痼疾使他聽不見樂器和歌唱的高音。這種愁苦，在他的作品里有所表現，如「悲愴朔拿大」（一七九九），全集卷十之三的朔拿大中的Largo，但並非全部作品都帶憂鬱，如歡悅的「七重奏」（一八〇〇），明澈如水的「第一交響樂」（一八〇〇）。在這些肉體的痛苦之上，另外又加一種痛苦，他抱着一股劇烈的熱情，不斷地鍾情，如醉如狂的顚倒，夢想幸福，但是後來受了愛情的欺騙，做了愛情的犧牲品。一八〇一，他熱情的對象是琪麗哀太。琪却爾第，他題贈給她著名的「月光朔拿大」（一八〇二）。瑛麗哀太在一八〇三年十一月嫁了伽侖堡伯爵，使貝多芬的心靈遭受摧殘，差不多要結束他的生命。愛情，痛苦，頹喪而驕傲的意志，都反映在一八〇二年的大作品里：附有葬曲的朔拿（全集卷廿六）；俗稱月光曲的幻想朔拿大，卷卅一之二的朔拿大；獻給亞歷山大皇的提琴朔拿大；克埒采朔拿大；卷四十八的六支悲壯慘痛的宗敎歌。一八〇三的「第二交響樂」，却反映着他年少氣盛的情愛，顯然他的意志佔了優勢。革命感動了貝多芬，他夢想着一個英雄的共和國，他接連寫下「英雄交響樂」；「波那帕脫」（一八〇四）；帝國的史詩；和「第五交響樂」（一八〇五——〇八）的終局，光榮的敘事歌。一八〇六年五月，貝多芬和丹蘭士，特，勃侖斯維克訂了婚。這一年所寫的「第四交響樂」是一朶精純的花。愛情把他遺棄了，一八一〇年，他重又變成孤獨。愛情沒有了；野心沒有了；所剩下衹有力，他的舉止愈加放肆。歌德設法要認識貝多芬，一八一二年在波希米的浴塲托帕列茲相遇，但性格不同，不很投機。「第七」和「第八交響樂」便是這時代的作品，一八一二年在托帕列茲寫的。一八一四年是貝多芬幸運的頂點，也維也納會議中，人家看他做歐羅巴的光榮。但接接踵而來的是最悲慘的時期，高傲而獨立的天才不得人心，允諾津貼並未付足，耳朶完全聾了。在此悲苦的深淵裏，貝多芬謳歌歡樂。這是他畢生的計劃，從一七九三年在蓬恩時就有這個念頭。「第九交響樂」的歡樂頌歌的主題是在一八二二年寫下的。但在寫「第九交響樂」時，他還沒有打定主意，還想把歡樂頌歌留下來，放在第十或第十一交響樂中。貝多芬在頹喪之際，正想離開他的祖國，但是出「第九交響樂」第一次演奏（一八二四年五月七日）的成功，他還是留下了。物質生活窘迫如故，貧病交迫，孤獨無依，可是他戰勝了命運和痛苦。他高喊出：「犧牲，永遠把一切人生底愚昧爲你的藝術去犧牲！」他逝世前四個月完成的作品，全集一三〇的四重奏的新的結束是非常輕快的。一八二六年十一月，他得着肋膜炎性的感冒，爲姪子奔走前程歸來，在維也納病倒了。一八二七年三月二十六日，貝多芬在大風雨中，大風雪中，一聲響雷中，嚥了最後一口氣。</p>
<p>這是貝多芬的一生，在羅曼羅蘭的筆下是一個熱情抑　勇敢戰鬥的巨人。在原著中，除了傳記部分外，尙附有「貝多芬遺囑」，「書信集」，和「思想錄」。</p>
<p>譯者傳雷附有一篇「貝多芬的作品及其精神」，首先頌揚貝多芬的精神的力。其次，分析貝多芬對音樂的建樹：推翻朔拿大的刻板規律；和聲雖很單純古典，但較前代又有很大的進步；對於樂器使用的改革。由於他，音樂從死的學術一變而爲活的意識。最後，把貝氏重要作品如鋼琴朔拿大，提琴與鋼琴朔拿大，四重奏，合奏曲，交響樂，宗敎音樂等加以詮釋。</p>
<p>爲了欣賞文學，或爲了要了解一個音樂偉人的一生，這本書是值得一讀的。羅蘭曼羅活潑而熱情的筆調，譯者忠實而暢達的譯文這是毋須介紹的。</p>
<h3>讀小坡的生日</h3>
<p>— 鄭家璦</p>
<p>「小坡的生日」是老舍先生早期的作品，這是一部近六萬字左右的長篇童話；大槪可分前後兩段，前段描寫一個小孩名呌小坡的生活片斷，後面是叙述一個曲折離奇的夢境，那是小坡生日的晚上，所做的夢。</p>
<p>小坡是在新加坡生長的中國男孩，他的父親是店舖老板，媽媽是最慈愛的母親；他的大哥呌大坡，妹妹名仙坡，他們有一個很快樂的家庭。我們知道，世界上每一個小孩，都有他自己生存的天地，小坡當然亦不能例外，他是那麼天眞，好奇，對任何一件最小的事物，他總發生興趣，不時地詢問和思索，永遠不肯靜止一會兒似的；不論他和同伴們玩要的時候，或是一個人孤獨的時候，他有着無窮的喜悅，往往仰着頭，微笑地張望這「謎」般的世界，雖然他懂得的是那樣稀少。小坡弄不清楚這些：「廣東是不是就是印度呢？」；「雪的顏色是紅的嗎？是不是當新娘新郎出來的時候，將多人向他們所撒的細碎紅紙片兒呢？」；「火車一動，街道，樹木，人馬，房子，電綫桿子就會向後面跑了嗎？」；「爲什麼先生們這樣愛敎書，他們不喜歡玩要？」；還有「爲什麼先生單就要問77是多少，「8」不是比「7」順眼得多，而且橫着看還可以當眼鏡兒嗎？」……這些希奇古怪的問題，小坡想不通，可是他會想法子應付妹妹的各種詢問。</p>
<p>小坡有一件最珍貴的「秘密」：他希望自己將來做一個「偉大」的人物；一個看門的印度人，頭上裹着大白布包頭，威風凜凜地站在那裏，替妹妹守着舖子；或者「等自己長大了，他還可以當馬來巡警，站在十字街上，指揮交通；衹要他的手臂微微一動，所有的車子都按着他的「命令」動靜了，這是多麼有勢呀！小坡樂開了，他眞願意立刻就長大起來，去做自己喜歡做的事情；可是這種「可笑的侈望」，他不敢吿訴他們的父母和敎師；衹有當爸爸到舖子裏去的時候，媽媽睡午覺的片刻，他在屋子裏，悄悄地對仙坡提起；他還把紅綢巾包在頭上，或是　在腰間；起勁地表演着，仙坡弄不清楚這些，但　總是笑嘻嘻地應和着，她覺得她的二哥眞是一位了不起的英雄。</p>
<p>在學校裏的日子，小坡愛打「抱不平」，他常常用「腦袋」撞倒專欺女孩子的「張禿子」，他講公德，從不故意弄壞人家店裏掛着的鴨和小猪：走在路上，遇見老太太拿不動東西時，就趕過去幫忙，而且從不要人家的報酬，因爲他覺得自己是個好孩子。</p>
<p>小坡不十分喜歡到學校，往往趁先生打盹的時候，逃出敎室去玩，可是正經起來，他的了解力很强，也能懂得許多東西。</p>
<p>有一天，小坡生日的那天，爸爸不像平常那樣嚴肅了，領着他們弟兄三人，到動物園去看猴子；下午，又上電影院去看電影；就在這頂頂開心的日子，他躺在牀上，幽幽入夢，夢見狼王變成戲裏的男主角去打一羣猴子，而那猴王却就是張禿子變的；二方面打得眞有勁，花樣百出，有趣極了，在經過許多周折後，小坡覺得自己的身子快落入海裏去了！他就這麼嚇醒，故事也完了</p>
<p>整個看來，作者的重心是放在後半段的「怪夢」中的，他運用了豐富的理想力，把情節渲染得奇突，緊張；引人入勝；然而，我却比較更偏愛前面描寫，小坡在學校家庭中的許多逸事，兒童心理是刻劃得那麼細膩，每個動作，每一句話，都活潑潑地雀　在紙上，彷彿這些孩子，以前，你曾經在甚麼地方看見過的，但已淡忘了，現在他們的影子却又在這裏被你找尋到；你能不承認作者構思的苦心麼？本來，像老舍這樣以描寫個性見著的大作家，不用我再多說甚麼，可是還要來嘮叨，實在是由於衷心的喜悅和敬佩罷了！</p>
<p>「小坡的生日」是一本兒童最好的讀物，他能助長他們的幻想力，更能滋養孩子們靈性的發展，我願意父母和敎師們，把牠介紹給你的孩子和學生；同時對於有志從事兒童讀物的寫作者，這一本是不可少的參考書。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，不禁使我想起十年前的一件瑣事：那時候我在初中二年讀書，敎我們國文的高老師，有一次把「小坡的生日」列入課外閱讀書本之一，學校的圖書館因不備這書，過後也就揀了另外的書看了！可是這個輕鬆的名字，却沒有遺忘掉，直到十年後的今天，又輪到我自己站在講台上，向一羣孩子們介紹這一篇童話時，眞有一種說不出的滋味？是在懷念那慈祥的高老師麼？還是珍惜往年的生涯？兒童時代像烟雲一般地散了，可是在甚麼時候開始的呢？……你不能不驚異歲月飛逝的無情……直到有一天，有一天你故意去翻閱一本兒童們所讀的童話時，你才會眞正體味到牠的可貴，你才會由衷地感激那一位作者——因爲衹有牠一直在關心你，衹有他爲你留下了最美最善的夢境，當你已不再是個孩子的時候。</p>
<h3>和平的四大基石</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>作者狄安夫人</p>
<p>美國麥克格魯書局最近出版</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰勝利結束迄今，還沒有滿年：戰後的世界，瘡痍滿目，根本談不到復興與繁榮；但是新的國際戰爭的危機，又在醞釀之中了，我們固然不願危言聳聽，說第三次世界大戰就在眼前；但是可以說：「戰爭雖已結束，但是和平尙未降臨」，還要待我們的爭取。</p>
<p>作者狄安夫人，是美國第一流的女作家，研究國際問題，頗有心得，除任美國外交政策協會研究員而外，並在美國各大學敎授國際問題一門功課，她能操六國語言，足跡遍天下，曾到蘇聯，德國，芬蘭，挪威，瑞士，奧地利，法國暨拉丁美洲各國，實地考察世界各國的政情，對於她研究國際問題大有裨益。</p>
<p>不論在她的思想上或行動上，她是美國式的和平主義者的典型；一方面酷愛和平，不願美國再參加戰爭：另一方成反對孤立主義，她說：「我們現在都知道，世界其他各國若爲戰爭或內亂所摧毀，受到饑荒，貧困與疾病的威脅，那末我們也不能在國內享受和平與繁榮。」</p>
<p>她對於國際政治的見解，都是非常在正確的。</p>
<p>她認爲人類當前最重要的工作，就是「完成和平」。但是各國人民的要求，一方面是個人的安全，不受失業的威脅另一方面國家的安全，不受外來的侵略。因此各國爲了本身的安全，都要爭取「安全地帶」，反而引起國際的擾動與不安，今日國際的危機，就潛伏在各國爭取安全地帶的鬥爭中。但是怎樣才能消除今日國際間的危機呢？她提出一個具體辦法，要採取集體行動，就是要擁護聯合國機構以維持世界和平。至於國際組織怎樣才能有效呢？第一，遇國際間發生足以引起戰爭的衝突時，名國應即互相諮詢，謀得和平解決。第二，國際組織須有軍隊，得隨時制止侵略。</p>
<p>她基於這個信心，研究國際安全與世界和平；同時又本着這個信念，寫作這一本「和平的四大基石」（The　Four　Cornereones　of　Peacl）共分七章：</p>
<p>（一）緒論</p>
<p>（二）鄧巴克橡樹會議</p>
<p>（三）雅爾達會議</p>
<p>（四）墨西哥京城會議</p>
<p>（五）舊金山會議</p>
<p>（六）波茨坦及以後</p>
<p>（七）美國選民與國際組織</p>
<p>尙有附錄重要國際文獻多件。確實可供研究國際問題參考。</p>

<h3>關於「關於女人」</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>從前，我讀過冰心女士的小說，詩，散文，……愛她那清麗超然的筆調，詩心，和哲理；像抒情的樂章，平湖秋月夜的洞簫，典雅的中國畫，淡寫輕描。</p>
<p>她愛自然，讚美大海，歌頌母愛，有同情，憐憫，慈悲的心，至善最美的情，她的思想像晴空裏飛着的白鴿，沒有鷹的飛揚，沒有夏蟬的熱烈的呼呌，但是却傾向着光明，連得美麗的藍天都更可愛了。</p>
<p>這一次，冰心女士用了「男士」的筆名和立塲寫下了「關于女人」。像「關于女人」，這樣的好書還要介紹，實在是太多餘的事，不知有多少讀者們已經先我多少時候讀過，更不知有多少人像我一樣已經不止一次的讀過，但是，我總覺得有一點什麼要說似的，於是，我原諒了我的多事。</p>
<p>本書共計有十六節，描寫十四個不同身份，不同個性的女人，這十四個女人是一位「我最尊敬體貼她們」的「男士」的母親，敎師，奶娘，同學，同班，學生，房東，鄰居，帮佣，朋友的太太和母親、以及弟弟們的妻子……等。那位「我最尊敬體貼她們」的「男士」就是冰心女士的化名和化身，那位男士是憑虛的，因爲「男士」自己原就是女士，然而書中所叙的十四個女人却並非屬於烏有，在昨天，在今天，在明天，在這裏，在那裏，在更遠的什麼地方，我看見過，你看見過，他們全都看見過……</p>
<p>爲什麼要用這一個化名呢？許是作者描寫時更多一些親切的感情？讀者閱讀時更多眞實的感覺？我想是如此？</p>
<p>這十四個女人，並不驚才絕　，也無豐功偉業，沒有一個是天使，也沒有一個是聖徒，但是也可以說：個個都是天使，個個都是聖徒，作者在「後記」裏寫着：「……女人似乎更重視親子的愛，弟兄姊妹的愛，夫妻的愛，朋友的愛……她願意爲她所愛的對象犧牲了一切。實際上，還不是她願意不願意的問題，她是無條件的，「摩頂放踵」的犧牲了，愛了再說……」世界上有什麼比犧牲是更偉大的情操呢？無條件的犧牲，摩頂放踵的犧牲，愛了再說；不是天使也是天使了，不是聖徒也是聖徒了。</p>
<p>這十四個女人，她們的生命，像溪流裏的水，溫靜的流着；沒有驚濤駭浪的英烈故事，也沒有曲折離奇的命運，她們生活得十分平淡，但是我們誰能否認？——那動人的平淡是較曲折的動人更爲來得動人。她們自然沒有引起大多數人廣博的注意，可是她們每一個，在愛她們的每一個人的心目中已經留下最深刻的永恒的記憶了。她們的名字沒有留在歷史上，但是她們的每一個微笑和嘆息，都留在家人和朋友的回想中了。</p>
<p>當然，作者似乎遺忘了那些不好的，不善良的，壞的女人，但是我們必須記得，本書的作者，乃是一個「我最尊敬體貼她們」的「男士」所以全是偏於善的一方面。</p>
<p>讀了「關於女人」以後，我覺得那典雅的國畫更會令人神往了，月夜的簫聲分外動人了，樂意裏比以前更添了許多厚實的情感，生命中最可珍貴的東西……</p>
<p>最後，我要摘錄作者的後記中所說：「……她比男人多些顏色，也多些聲音……世界上若沒有女人，這世界至少要失去十分之五的「眞」，十分之六的「善」，十分之七的「美」……」這話是對的麼？別說我不敢說，連問都不敢問，甚至想也不敢想。我神經過敏的妄自猜度，也許冰心女士所以要化名，還就是爲了這幾句話。我想：那最妥善的答案，該是男士們的搖頭或點頭罷！?</p>

<h3>楊志雄出來</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>滬聞社有一條消息，談到德僑管理委員會前主任委員楊志雄有貪汚瀆職的嫌疑，這段新聞的論證如下：</p>
<p>（一）前因：楊志雄曾充任本市德商西門子洋行買辦達二十五年之久。於勝利前數月，因受德僑之主使，乃赴內地活動德僑管理委員會之官職，所有費用，悉由德僑所供給，故勝利後楊即奉命來滬，辦理德僑管理事宜，大權在握，一切皆如願以償。</p>
<p>（二）事實：德領館所呈交楊之德僑名單，全數爲二千五百人，乃經審查管理後，德僑人數衹剩一千九百十餘名，且再經審核，以疾病及其他原因，准於留華之德僑，竟達六百餘名，而待輪返國者，衹八百餘人。</p>
<p>（三）近果：美國合衆社傳佈該管理委員會乘機勒索金條，包庇納粹份子。</p>
<p>這條消息是否確實，此時我們不敢遽加論斷，如果沒有，希望楊志雄立刻挺身出來。</p>
<p>不然，當局就應該澈查，務求水落石出。</p>
<p>貪汚多，瀆職多，我們不怕，我們所怕者有貪汚瀆職而不辦，而不澈底的辦！</p>
<h3>蠄蟝洞</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>香港仔那邊，在綠波漣漪上（衹是在天晴風靜的時候），禽渠洞是不只一個的，但外行人却無法找尋，然而，要是想作漁郎的問津，就算外行人也可「望問投止」的（其實它並沒有門）。原來它所謂禽渠洞也者，僅僅是一個象徴的名詞而已，並不眞有禽渠洞在。但，這名詞的侮辱性是相當强烈的，可是，正惟其有此強烈，那末，那些所謂禽渠便有其生財之道了。</p>
<p>攅禽渠洞，是香港的人們底一種玩意兒，其中的享樂和享受，大有異於塘西，而却於笞箕灣的水面上有相同之處，衹是，笞箕灣有使人裹足的地方，爲的是它那裏出名了麻瘋女的潛伏。其實，香港仔又誰敢說沒有這些恐怖底種子的隱藏呢？不過，環境是比笞箕灣好些罷了。</p>
<p>我初到香港，那是在八年前的時候，親友們爲要盡地主之誼，玩遍了香港所有好玩的地方，攅禽渠洞便是當時節目之一。</p>
<p>至戚陳君是香港一家洋行底經紀的領袖，又是香港這座山城一位玩的專家。家裏有的是自備汽車，多遠的地方也可載我玩去，某星期日的上午，他使帶我到香港仔去玩，同行的還有他一個弟弟，兩個知心的朋友；他和那兩個朋友以兄弟稱呼，雖不是世交，却也是至好，實則是利害與共的生意人，在我，就衹覺得他們兩人的俗不可耐。</p>
<p>香港仔在香港是著名吃海鮮的地方，那兒有兩家酒樓，一名鎭南，一名盧山，都是以烹調海鮮著名的所在，後來又從珠江轉移過來一艘破舊的紫洞艇，略加修理，也做起海上酒樓來，却奪去鎭南和盧山兩家的生意不少。</p>
<p>我們那天上午到香港仔，在一棵大榕樹下停放好汽車，走向海邊一處站立着許多蛋婦的地方，蛋婦見我們迎面而來，都提高尖喉嚨向我們直喊。我的至戚一人當先，揀上一個年青的蛋女，要坐她的艇，她便引我們下去，搖向綠波，不消半個鐘頭，已經到達了所謂禽渠洞了。禽渠洞裏攅出一個老醜的婦人，尖聲尖氣地呼着「大少」……，同時，禽渠，衹一個禽渠，也花花綠綠地攅出一個嬉笑着面孔的粉頭來。</p>
<p>禽渠洞衹是一艘中型的木艇而已，禽渠也就是那兒的水妓。圓篷蓋着正中，篷下是　息的所在，艙中靠櫓那一面有一層一層的木架，木架上是神座，是鏡　，是杯盤，是什物，也還井井有序，而且是清潔異常。我們從小艇上了艙面，爬進中艙，除去了鞋，分兩面　篷坐着。禽渠獻上清茶，我的至戚忙着編排秩序，第一是向外召幾個禽渠來，平均每人一個，第二是是公烟若干（烟具艇中現成）第三麻雀一副，第四海鮮四味，另外有湯，揚州炒飯，孫蒸一斤。節目排完，交給那老醜婦人去備辦。我的至戚和他那兩個至好唱起蛋歌來，他的弟弟和禽渠打趣着。</p>
<p>艙裏不能讓你起立，我對於一切都很外行，便翹頭去看青山，去看綠水。青山不老，山花嫣然，老樹葱蘢，衹是鹹腥味時刺鼻官，使我認爲美中不足。率性攅出艙來，俯視綠波，綠波裏針狀的細魚，羣羣相逐，不由手癢，取出手帕結成一個兜，向水裏兜去。可是，魚雖細小，却靈活異常，費了好大工夫，才網得兩尾，在手帕兜裏跳躍不定，我拿進艙去，大家略不一瞧，禽渠却兜搭上來，說是「石斑」，才出世不到一日。我玩了一會，重投向綠波，海面微現兩點水花，便即不見。</p>
<p>經時禽渠已從另一隻小艇陸續而來，粗獷痴肥，殊不値一顧，而鳴聲嘓嘓，刺耳欲聾。等到大家大烟抽過，麻雀搓完，海鮮已從外面送至。各人旣飽且醉，日影已西；我則兩腿痳痺，繼而　疼欲絕，心想拳曲半日，無處伸足，禽渠洞之攅，實大苦事。當時雖不便明言，嗣後至戚相邀，不敢再作「前渡劉郞」之想了。</p>
<p>（編者註）禽渠皆有虫旁。</p>
<h3>求愛無罪</h3>
<p>— 循介</p>
<p>七月一日新聞：無錫模範會計補習學校校長李福康，年三十左右，寫情書向某女生求愛，女生當衆將信宣讀，李恐事態擴大，向學生道歉，並書悔過書一通，學生即推代表五人，向縣政府敎育科請求究辦云云。</p>
<p>這事雖小，但有關師道的尊嚴，敎育的清高，以及人生中難能可貴的愛情！我個人有一點小感想！</p>
<p>就這事的本身言，堂堂一個校長，負起敎育英才，挽救社會風氣的神聖使命，不應冒昧的寫信向一個自己知道對方，而對方不知道自己的女學生談愛情！</p>
<p>但是，說回來，人是有感情的動物，舊社會的封建思想，若「男女授受不親」，「嫂溺援之以手乎」？這一類的問題，在新時代裏，早應該打破了！</p>
<p>愛情沒有階級的觀念，只要是雙方同意，能互相眞心的愛，不論是師，是生，是富，是貧，是貴，是賤，都可以有圓滿結合的可能。</p>
<p>假若李的信裏，只表自己內心的愛慕，以及希望從友誼上慢慢進展，裏面沒有猥凟的辭句，沒有威嚇性的要挾，那末，這封信不應該視爲不合法不正當的信件。</p>
<p>假如李沒有結過婚，那末，他寫信給一個他所愛慕的女學生表示他的愛意，他沒有違反法律。這封信不過是徵求對方意見的媒介物，沒有什麼居心不良的地方，沒有侵犯人家自由的地方！</p>
<p>他做到校長，不過是他的才能比人家高，知識比人家豐富，不能說一做校長，他就應放棄了愛情，何况以合法正當的信件，向對方徵求同意，沒有過分處。假使他不是校長，而是個三十幾歲的男同學，或許接到這信的那個女學生，就處之坦然了。</p>
<p>不同意人家的合理的要求時，爽直的加以拒絕已够了，如若對人家誠意的愛慕，坦白的表示，非但加以拒絕，更加以難堪，以至於窮加追究，這在我個人看來，似乎不免太過分一點。</p>
<p>像這一類事，在文明的國家裏，沒有什麼希奇，因爲文明的世界上，愛情是公開的，坦白的，熱誠的，只要不越出合法的軌道，向你所愛慕的人示愛，算不得大驚小怪。同時被示愛的人，接受不接受人家的愛，亦有同樣的自由；相反的，甚且應對愛慕她（或他）的人表示謝意，如果不能接受，也很客氣的婉加謝絕。</p>
<p>最後，我以爲，這一類事情的發生，本是很自然的，但所以驚人的原因還是由於社會封建思想的沒有肅清。罪不在李福康，也不在某女生，而是整個社會封建思想的遺毒！</p>

<p>DDT對我們的攻擊不可說不利害，但我們總覺得它僅是一時的潮流而已。所以目前我們暫時是分組分區活動工作的，例如有楊樹浦區，菜市街區（半市區式），曹家渡區，南市區等……。各區弟兄的生活方式大同小異，恕不分區詳述。當我們每天早上在公厠中一宿醒來，我們就結隊的飛進近段的小菜塲裏，在那裏眞可算得大食堂了，五花八門什麼都有，吃肉吃魚還不是家常便飯？最配我們胃口的要算鄕下人帶來販賣的鹹肉了。半隻鹹猪他們要賣上幾天，我們在這幾天裏「篤定」地東吃一些西吮一些，而滋味也好像一天好似一天；但弟兄們也有吃厭的。孔二先生的三月不知肉味，那有我們幸運呢？魚類中的食糧更多了，像烏賊，淡　，黃魚，死了的黃鱔都是山珍海味，想想你們只吃些猪　吃剩的東西，糞坑裏的尿糞，比起我們來眞有　壞之別哩！其餘還有新上市的寗波鹹蟹和江北蝦米，這也不能說不是我們的時鮮菜啊！最舒適的我們吃飽了還可以借着肉舖裏的砧板打個瞌睡。午後天氣較早上熱了些，我們就沿馬路逛着，到處看看，在馬路上看到一張「霍亂年年有今年特別多」的標語，我們鼓舞得什麼似的，因爲在這上面可以給我們一個工作緊張和努力的明證！我們沿路越飛越開心，我們覺得也熱起來了。不打緊，好的是沿途都有冷飲攤，人們吃餘或根本未吃的牛奶刨冰汁，檸檬水等，我們也可以沾些唇，甜甜嘴兒，一種芬芳香馥，說來恐怕你們也得垂涎三尺！夕陽西沉的晚上，正是我們游倦思歸的時候；我們在歸途上隨便找個酒店，吃酒我們是不敢嚐試，可是聞聞酒香也是一件韻事。加之酒店前的熟肉攤，也是我們的膳室。猪頭肉，燻魚，烤鴨，醬雞，油氽蝦，五香牛肉……那一樣不是上等菜肴？你們說我們的吃福好，但你們看到我們這封信，怕也要噤舌無語了吧！天黑了，我們帶着醉意安步當車的回家尋夢，明天，後天……這樣一天一天的安穩着過下去，有什麼不快活？你說！附帶的報告就是我們除了以上所述的幾種食物以外，我們還可冒着胆子飛到最熱鬧的市區裏嚐嚐餓死的人肉滋味！你們請我們下鄕玩，倒不如我們來歡迎你們到這裏來參觀。再會，敬祝你們愉快！　城市的蒼蠅敬覆</p>

<p>華北漢奸江亢虎之女江兆菊，以父在押患病，堅請入獄奉侍，因不獲准許，甚至不食不眠，竟日泣於庭外，揮之不去；院長爲之感動，始准每日入獄兩次，奉侍湯藥，以全其孝思，奸門居然出孝女，自屬難得，可惜她頗曉倫常大義，而却不能於江附逆之時，作一番諍諫，免其父淪爲國家民族罪人，則不但有孝，且亦盡忠，更無需今日之泣求入獄奉侍湯藥矣。</p>

Over thirty committee members, including Dai Chuan, Bai Chongxi, Sun Ke, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Shao Liyu, Liang Hancao, and Wu Dingchang, attended.

Subsequently, the following important matters were discussed and approved: (1) The National Assembly is scheduled to convene on November 12th of this year; (2) Approved the Ministry of Food's proposed "Methods for Collecting and Borrowing Real Land Tax for the 35th Year" and emergency measures regarding land tax and food; (3) Approved the extension of the term of the current National Political Council members by six months (originally, the term of the current members was to expire on July 6th of this year); (4) Approved for record the "Organizational Regulations of the Nanjing Municipal Housing Rental and Sales Management Committee" as forwarded by the Executive Yuan; (5) Appointed Wang Bingxi and Chen Anren as members of the Legislative Yuan; (6) Confirmed the validity of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, with specific implementation methods to be formulated separately.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Supreme National Defense Council today decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th, the anniversary of the birth of the Founding Father. It is heard that this decision was made after several considerations. This action demonstrates the government's determination to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and promote the democratization of Chinese politics through action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] At 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department announced the news of convening the National Assembly at a press conference for foreign reporters. Minister Peng stated: The government has decided today to convene the National Assembly on November 12th of this year. This move reaffirms the government's determination to end political tutelage, implement constitutional government, and return power to the people as soon as possible. It is hoped that all parties and non-affiliated individuals will work together to ensure that the National Assembly, which has been repeatedly postponed, can convene as scheduled this time without delay. This is the earnest expectation of the government and the people of the whole country. At the same time, the government has also decided to extend the term of the National Political Council, which is about to expire, by six months from July 7th. After the announcement, Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs answered several questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Confirmed Representative Quotas for Newly Established Provinces</p>

<h3>Direct Negotiations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Failed to Yield Results; Talks to Continue at Noon Today; Zhou Enlai Visited Marshal Ma Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] It is heard that five representatives of the government and the Communist Party held a two-hour meeting last night at the residence of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng at No. 8 Putuo Road. The two sides exchanged opinions on the unresolved issues of the military tripartite meeting, including the reorganization and integration of troops, the issue of the Communist army's garrison areas, and the administrative rights in northern Jiangsu. The recent sudden incidents of the Communist army's Central Plains Military Region, led by Li Xiannian, disturbing the Pinghan Railway in Xinyang and Liulin were also briefly mentioned. The Communist Party representatives, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, seemed to avoid the pending issues of military reorganization and garrison areas, hoping to convene the Political Consultative Conference to delay the matter. Therefore, the talks did not yield results. However, the representatives of both sides were able to calmly exchange opinions during the talks. At the end of the meeting, they agreed to continue the talks after mutual consideration. An authoritative source told our reporter that, judging from the results of the first meeting between the KMT and the Communist Party representatives last night, the crux of the current issue of the Communist army's garrison areas lies in the various political demands put forward by the Communist Party. This issue is extremely complex and unlikely to be resolved in a short period. It is expected that direct negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party can shorten the negotiation time as much as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Direct negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party began last night. At 10:30 AM today, Zhou Enlai went to Marshal Ma's residence to inform him of the progress of yesterday's talks and to discuss the future format of the talks. This afternoon, there was no activity from any party. As for the content of last night's talks, the issue remained the administrative rights after the withdrawal of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu. The Communist Party insisted on retaining administrative rights, proposing the so-called "public vote" method, while the government insisted that they should withdraw altogether. This point has not yet been agreed upon. At noon tomorrow, the two sides will continue to have direct talks at Chief of Staff Chen's residence to conduct detailed discussions on the above issues. According to observations from all parties, if this point can be agreed upon, then the remaining minor issues will be easier to resolve.</p>
<h3>Bishop Ford's Condition Improving; Plan to Return to America Cancelled</h3>

<h3>"Human Bomb"; Communist Army Cruel and Inhuman; Forcibly Sacrificing Civilians</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Military sources: The Communist army forced civilians to carry bombs and drive into the National Army's positions in Fenyang. The civilians, along with the bombs and the National Army in the positions, were annihilated together. This was named the "Human Bomb". This kind of Communist army atrocity was not only implemented in Fenyang, but has also been discovered when attacking National Army garrisons in other places. It can be described as extremely cruel.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Xuepei Talks About Recent Actions of the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei talked to reporters today about the military situation since the 30th of last month, briefly saying: There are currently two military actions worthy of attention. The Communist army began to attack Datong on the 22nd of last month and has occupied several villages about ten kilometers northeast and northwest of Datong, cutting off Datong's lines of communication and prohibiting local people from bringing food into the besieged city. At the same time, the Communist Party claimed that the government army surrounded and attacked the Communist army's positions in northern Hubei, which is absolutely not true. The government army still maintains its original positions. On the contrary, the Communist army is trying to break out and move elsewhere, violating the agreement.</p>
<h3>War in the Hubei-Henan Border Region Underway; Communist Army's Offensive Halted; Military Mediation Department Orders Cessation of Military Actions</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] The Military Mediation Department issued an order yesterday ordering the National Army and the Communist Army in Datong and the Hubei-Henan border region to cease military actions.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] In the Hubei-Henan border region, two brigades of the Communist army have been moving westward across the Pinghan Railway in the area north of Guangshui, south of Yangnan, since the 29th. Another two brigades are also trying to cross.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 3rd] The bridges and rails near the Huayuan Station on the Pinghan Railway, which were destroyed by the Communist army, have been repaired and traffic between Hankou and Zhengzhou can resume today. However, there is still Communist army disturbance around Guangshui, and in reality it may be difficult to pass through.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] Wang Shusheng's unit, the First Column of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, consisting of 15,000 men, launched a large-scale western offensive, fiercely attacking Liulin, north of Guangshui. They have made contact with the garrison troops and their offensive has been halted. Another unit of 6,000 men attacked west from an area more than ten miles north of Huayuan and have broken through to the west of the Pinghan Railway. After being intercepted, they have all retreated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] General Liu Ruming, commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone, recently told reporters that the main force of the Communist army led by Li Guangnian, which launched an attack on the Hubei border region, has now fled westward across the railway line, attacking the Siwang Mountains south of Xinyang and north of Bingshan. Liulin Station has been burned down by the Communist army and the fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] The Pinghan Railway has been closed between Hankou and Zhengzhou because about one kilometer of the railway track near Lixingdian Station, north of Xinyang, and a small bridge near Jiajiagang, south of Huayuan, were destroyed by the Communist army.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian Receives Reporters, Reports on Communist Army's Offensive</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 3rd] Director Cheng of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters received reporters this afternoon and delivered a speech. After detailing the government's repeated tolerance of the Communist Party in seeking a peaceful solution, Cheng reported on the recent offensive launched by the Communist army in the Central Plains region. He stated that since June 24th, the main force of Li Guangnian's unit has concentrated in the area between Panjiadian, Dingyuandian, and Xuanhuadian, and has fiercely attacked the Pinghan Railway between Xinyang and Huayuan. On the first of this month, they engaged in fierce battles with the National Army along the line from Yangpingkou, Daxindian, and Jigong Mountain to the south of Xinyang. One unit crossed the railway north of Huayuan at Weijiadian, another unit fled to the Baliwan area of Huangpi, and another unit fled east from Jingfu to the vicinity of Futianhe. Wherever they went, they destroyed communications and telecommunications, and brutally killed the old, weak, women, and children. The situation is still deteriorating. The garrison headquarters has the responsibility to defend the territory and protect the people, and cannot but take self-defense actions. If the situation further escalates, the National Army will take effective measures to stop it. When reporters asked about the strength of the Communist army and other recent attempts, Cheng replied that the strength of the Communist army in the garrison headquarters' jurisdiction is about 60,000 men. Their current attempts are to disrupt political consultation through military action in an attempt to delay time, and to jump out of the Central Plains Military Region and gather towards the Soviet camp in order to realize their conspiracy to transform small groups into a whole.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] Military officials claim: The Communist army has newly deployed 80,000 troops from Zhangjiakou and is pressing towards Datong. There are now 20,000 Communist troops pressing Gushan (north of Datong), 20,000 pressing Julebao (east of Datong), and 20,000 pressing Qingcijing (west of Datong). The Communist army occupying Shuoxian is also directing its main force north towards Datong. The situation there is on the eve of a storm. Ningwu, south of Yanghukou on the Inner Great Wall line, is also under fierce attack by the Communist army in northwestern Shanxi. Xuan'gang Town to its south has been captured.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Dismantles Hongze Lake Embankment Stones, Causing Flooding in Northern Jiangsu; Refugees Appeal, Urging the Communist Party to Rescind the Order</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Truth News Agency: The Communist army in northern Jiangsu, in order to commemorate its late Commander of the Third Division of the New Fourth Army, Peng Xuefeng, is mobilizing nearby people to dismantle a portion of the flagstones of the Hongze Lake embankment and transport them to Anhui to build the "Xuefeng Pagoda." As a result, the water level in the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu has risen sharply. The water level at Yumato Wharf in Gaoyou has risen from 1.1 zhang to 1.8 zhang in a week, and it is heard that it is still increasing. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation, northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. Recently, representatives of refugees from more than 20 counties in northern Jiangsu issued an appeal to the new world, begging the Communist Party to "show mercy" and rescind the order, and not to implement this measure. Otherwise, even if the three million refugees achieve their desire to return home, they will still have no home to return to.</p>

<h3>Traitor Lu Daoying Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Heard the Verdict and Was Pleasantly Surprised, Repeatedly Saying "Thank You!"; Traitor He Bingxian Tried Yesterday, Testimony of Witnesses Was Biased</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Lu Daoying, the former head of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Capital High Court at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Presiding Judge Jin Shiding explained that Lu Daoying, during his tenure as head of the puppet police bureau, trained special agents, destroyed the central government's underground work in Shanghai, and killed patriotic youths. His crime was unforgivable. However, it was found that Lu Daoying had indeed raised 3 million in education funding and provided relief to displaced youths, so he was given a lighter sentence at discretion. The main text of the verdict was: "Lu Daoying colluded with the enemy country, plotting rebellion against this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for a reasonable amount for the living expenses of his family." After hearing the verdict, Lu Daoying was pleasantly surprised and repeatedly said thank you.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Capital High Court today interrogated He Bingxian, the former education director of the puppet Central Military Academy. He Bingxian claimed that everything he did was in accordance with the orders of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, and he himself had no opinions. Witness Lin Kai's testimony was biased towards He Bingxian, saying that He had made considerable contributions to local charitable causes. Wang Jingwei's daughter, Wang Wenxun, went to the High Court to listen to the proceedings in the rain, and seemed to express great concern for He Bingxian.</p>

Due to the numerous interconnections between these topics, the committee members frequently referenced each other's remarks. As a result, the topic of "Rescuing the Industrial Crisis" was temporarily concluded before the fourth recess at 12:30 noon upon the chairman's announcement. The "Commodity Price Issues" will continue to be studied at the sixth meeting tomorrow morning. During the morning meeting, in addition to several committee members continuing to state the difficulties currently faced in managing industries, the issue of wages was the subject of prolonged and focused study. There was considerable debate and discussion on whether wages should continue to rise along with future commodity price indices. Some committee members also proposed supplementary measures such as "gradation." Finally, seventeen committee members, including Zhang Naiqi and Li Zhuchen, submitted a written proposal on the topic of "Rescuing the Industrial Crisis." It was decided to merge it with the new measures proposed by Committee Member Wu Qiyuan to restrict imports. A seven-member subcommittee was formed, consisting of Wu Qiyuan, Li Zhuchen, Li Junlong, Zhang Naiqi, Gao Shukung, Hu Ziang, and Dong Bingqi, a representative from the Ministry of Finance, to convene tonight and review the matter, submitting the results to the general meeting for discussion. During the afternoon's discussion on "Commodity Price Issues," the committee members first expressed their opinions separately on the discussion outline proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, unanimously agreeing that addressing the root causes is paramount to stabilizing prices. Given the current instability of national defense and political situation, immediate results are difficult to achieve. However, negative measures such as control, rationing, industrial loans, subsidies, and tax systems should also be carefully reviewed first. In addition, Dong Bingqi, the representative from the Ministry of Finance, and Jin Shihong, the representative from the Ministry of Communications, who attended the meeting, reported on the recent financial situation and the transportation situation, respectively. Among these, the issue of commodity price controls proved to be the most difficult to handle, but there was a common understanding on both sides, namely that control is not absolutely unnecessary at this time and place, but technical problems must be carefully improved in order to achieve practical results. Until 6:45 PM, the committee members continued to request the floor, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting due to the lateness of the hour.</p>

<h3>Dr. Minsde Discusses Church University Merger Plan; Currently Inspecting Jinling University and Other Schools in Nanjing, Set to Return to Shanghai Today.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Dr. Minsde, Executive Secretary of the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, arrived in Nanjing on the 30th of last month to inspect Jinling University and other schools and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd. When discussing the new plan for the merger of the fourteen Christian universities in China, he stated: "Christian higher education urgently needs a new plan. The most important points are approximately three: (1) Strengthen character education to complete democratic spirit training. (2) Emphasize quality over quantity. The number of universities established and students trained will all follow this principle. (3) Raise academic standards and promote a research-oriented academic atmosphere to reach world standards. To achieve the above goals, eight higher education centers will be established throughout China: (1) Beijing, with Yenching University as the highest institution of learning, and a graduate school will be established. (2) Jinan, Qilu University will focus on medicine, science, and rural construction education. (3) In Shanghai, St. John's University, Soochow University, the University of Shanghai, and Hujiang University will jointly form a large, top-tier institution of learning with six colleges: arts, science, engineering, commerce, medicine, and law. (4) Nanjing, with Jinling University as the highest institution of learning, and a graduate school will be established. Jinling Women's College and Jinling Theological Seminary will closely cooperate with it, and there will be no overlapping subjects. (5) Wuchang will be Huachung University. (6) Chengdu, West China Union University will focus on arts and sciences, as well as medicine and dentistry. (7) Guangzhou will be Lingnan University. (8) Fuzhou, Fukien Christian University and Hwa Nan Women's College will share the same campus and cooperate closely. All of the above fourteen universities that accept this plan will receive full financial support. The 'United Board for Christian Colleges in China' has decided on a five-year 'economic plan' to raise a fund of US$15 million. Its use is: the first five million US dollars will be used for the restoration expenses of each school; the second five million US dollars will be used for the current expenses of the next five years; the third five million US dollars will be used for development expenses. In addition, large sums will be requested from the Chinese government and raised from all sectors of Chinese society to realize this plan." During Dr. Minsde's visit to Nanjing, in addition to inspecting Jinling University and other schools, it is reported that he met with the authorities and also met with General Marshall. After taking a short rest upon his return to Shanghai, he will begin his scheduled eight-week inspection flight, touring the above eight Christian education centers.</p>

<h3>Editorial: This Year's July 4th - A Review and Prospect of Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>July 4th is the Independence Day of the United States of America; this year's July 4th is also the National Day of the Republic of the Philippines, marking its declaration of independence. After 48 years of American protection, the Philippines is now an independent and free country. China, the United States, and the Philippines are all Pacific nations. We want to congratulate the United States and even more so the Philippines!</p>
<p>The question of Philippine independence has been raised several times in the past. The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically stood in stark contrast to the relationship between Britain and India. Indians have repeatedly sought independence, but the British government has been reluctant to grant it. The people of the Philippines, on the other hand, have not been particularly eager for independence, and in the past, the Americans have been the ones to want them to be independent. This peculiar situation can only be explained by the Philippines' geographic location. The Philippines is situated between Japan and the United States, and Japan has always had ambitions towards the Philippines. The Philippines' own military strength, currently only 40,000 regular troops, is certainly insufficient to resist Japanese aggression. Without American assistance, true independence would be an illusion. However, on the American side, when isolationists were on the rise, they were unwilling to risk international disputes by protecting the Philippines. As for the economy, even if the United States did not lose money, it would at least not gain much profit. Therefore, in the eyes of American isolationists, the Philippines seemed somewhat of a burden to the United States. Now that Japanese power has collapsed, both sides are willing to maintain an independent relationship, which is certainly a natural development. However, in economic and military terms, many Filipinos are still very anxious, believing that independence would mean losing urgently needed assistance from the United States and are thus willing to postpone the period of independence.</p>
<p>During this recent election, Osmeña advocated for independence, while Roxas had his spokesperson, Alvirin Raro, declare in his stead for postponement. Roxas, however, won the election. This reflects, at least in part, that Filipinos are very willing to be independent, but due to the circumstances, this willingness is tinged with some anxiety.</p>
<p>The new Philippine President Roxas is a progressive figure. During the Japanese occupation, Roxas commanded guerrilla forces to continue fighting against the Japanese until he was captured by the Japanese and briefly joined the puppet government, but his position was not high. He is a very capable person, and General MacArthur has expressed particular confidence in him. After successfully winning the election, he announced his policies: first, to rebuild the Philippines, and second, to cooperate thoroughly with the United States. These two paths can be said to be interconnected. Even today, the Republic of the Philippines still seems to lack the strength to completely break away from the United States. Without American help, Philippine independence and reconstruction would undoubtedly be very difficult. Political independence is one thing, but economic and military independence are quite another.</p>
<p>If the international situation can be resolved peacefully, the United States may be willing to completely let go of the Philippines, and Filipinos will undoubtedly be even more willing to gain complete freedom and independence. As the current situation stands, the Philippines still needs its caretaker to look after it at all times. Here, we would like to urge the Chinese nation to also pay attention to this basic principle of nation-building: If a country cannot be economically independent and militarily self-sufficient, then political independence alone is still somewhat dangerous.</p>
<p>According to the new agreement, the Philippines and the United States will continue to cooperate. In military terms, the 7,000 islands will be entirely developed by the Philippines itself for national defense, but the United States Navy will retain all of its bases on the islands. This is welcomed by the Filipinos; they cannot but welcome it, because with this protection, the Philippines can be safe from aggression by any ambitious country. Even in diplomatic terms, the United States will still help train personnel for the Philippine government so that they can be assigned as ambassadors and ministers in the future. Regarding the economy, cooperation between the two countries will be strengthened.</p>
<p>We feel that the attitude of the United States is very different from what it used to be. In the past, apart from foreign trade, it only wanted to close its doors and ignore the affairs of the world. The United States used to seem like a wealthy young man, well-fed and well-clothed, leisurely and carefree, who would run away quickly when he saw others fighting, afraid of getting blood splattered on his clothes. This World War has given her a painful lesson! Americans have deeply realized that the Monroe Doctrine is not suitable for modern trends. World security requires full cooperation from all countries to build and maintain a balanced power. Once this balance is shaken, ambitious individuals will seize the opportunity. After the First World War, the United States did not fully support China, which aroused Japan's ambitions; the United States did not actively intervene in European politics, which created the opportunity for German aggression. Now, the United States not only does not take a bystander's attitude towards the Philippines, but also, towards any corner of the world, as long as it discovers elements that threaten peace, it is immediately willing to take active action. For example, regarding Trieste being assigned to Yugoslavia, the United States in the past would never have opposed this so resolutely.</p>
<p>From an outsider's perspective, this attitude of the United States is helpful for world peace. We sincerely hope that the world's current powerful nations will not only refrain from aggressing against others themselves but will also cooperate with each other to actively eliminate any elements that could cause war or tempt ambitious individuals. Peace-loving and powerful nations cannot close their doors and stand idly by, watching the world's affairs, because once a fire breaks out and continues to spread, it can quickly burn down their own comfortable houses.</p>
<p>We want to congratulate the people of the Philippines that the Republic of the Philippines can achieve political independence today. We especially hope that the Republic of the Philippines can also truly achieve military and economic independence in the near future. We want to praise the American spirit of "treating the small with greatness," this spirit of maintaining world peace. Today, the United States has not completely abandoned its support for the Philippines, nor has it abandoned its responsibility for any country in the world that needs help. This is a manifestation of its great spirit.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that under the leadership of the capable President Roxas, all aspects of the Philippines will make rapid progress. We further hope that after China's recent peaceful unification, since China, the United States, and the Philippines are all located in the Pacific, China can provide greater sympathy and help to the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines so that they can work together to maintain world peace forever.</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Regions: Xi Zhihe, Suspect in Sichuan Corruption Case, Arrested in Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu Airmail] Xi Zhihe, former Director of the Jialing River Sub-bureau of the Storage and Transportation Bureau, was arrested by the Provincial Capital Police Bureau on the morning of June 29th at his residence at No. 16 Tidu West Street in Chengdu. After a brief interrogation that afternoon, he was transferred to the District Court on June 30th for processing. According to the officer in charge of this case at the Police Bureau, Xi Zhihe's arrest was due to reports that he had embezzled millions during his tenure. Provincial Senator Chen Ziyu and others submitted a special proposal requesting the provincial government to thoroughly investigate and prosecute him. Since Xi Zhihe's resignation and arrival in Chengdu, he had heard rumors that it would be disadvantageous to him and attempted to flee the area. Therefore, the Provincial Senate sent a letter to the Police Bureau to immediately arrest him. Note: Xi Zhihe is from Nanchong and is 60 years old. According to a local weekly newspaper, he is currently the Minister of Finance of the Democratic League. However, there is no such position as Minister of Finance in the publicly organized Democratic League. Mr. Xi is only a responsible committee member of the Democratic League's financial department.

<p>Hangzhou: Provincial Government Implements Joint Office</p>
<p>Since Shen Honglie took office as the head of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, he has been determined to reform, especially with regard to joint office. This is greatly beneficial to the spirit of office work and the improvement of administrative efficiency. On the one hand, it strengthens contact, so that everything can be heard without separation; on the other hand, it simplifies procedures, eliminating the need for repeated transfers. The various departments, which were originally scattered in various locations, have all moved into the Provincial Government since June. The established joint office method was also submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval and officially implemented on July 1st.</p>

<h3>President Roxas' Message: Encouraging Filipinos to Strive for the Country</h3>

America's assistance to us is unprecedented in history, and it is our responsibility not to betray their trust.</p>

<h3>Wishing for the Maintenance of Close Ties Between the United States and the Philippines</h3>
<p>Statement Issued by the U.S. Secretary of the Army</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd] July 4, 1946, is the Philippine Independence Day. U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"As the Filipino people achieve complete independence, I and all the soldiers of the U.S. Army extend our congratulations to them. July 4th is not only the Independence Day of the Philippines but also of the United States. The celebration of this double anniversary will undoubtedly be even more joyous. Whether in the present or in the future, this commemoration holds dual significance for our two nations, namely the independence of the West and the independence of the East.</p>
<p>During the years when the Philippines was under U.S. rule, the Filipino people made remarkable progress in preparing for full independence, which ultimately fostered the closest friendly ties between our two nations. The friendship of the American soldiers who served in the Philippines and the Americans who befriended the Filipinos is particularly close. During the fierce war against Japan, our soldiers had close contact with the Filipino people, and we deeply admire the fortitude of the people of the new republic.</p>
<p>We are honored to join with all nations in welcoming this heroic nation into the international community. We wish this new democracy success in its efforts for peace and prosperity, and that it will seize the opportunity to contribute to the happiness and well-being of mankind."</p>
<h3>Stimson Sends a Telegram Wishing for the Prosperity of the Philippines</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] Former U.S. Secretary of War Stimson today sent a telegram congratulating the Philippines on its independence, saying, "I wish to take this historically significant day to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Filipino people. For forty years, I have been deeply concerned about the welfare of the Filipino people. In 1920, I lived on the beautiful island of the Philippines in the capacity of Governor-General, living among the local people, and my concern turned into affection. I subsequently returned home to serve as Secretary of War. The American and Filipino people fought together and achieved victory. I witnessed the brave and loyal resistance of the Filipino people to the brutal Japanese invasion. Now that the Filipino people have joined the ranks of the world's major powers, they must also shoulder significant responsibilities and face serious dangers. Fortunately, the Filipino people have had years of experience in self-governance, and their capabilities are increasing daily. I sincerely hope that they will continue to forge ahead, promoting peace and prosperity. The United States and the Philippines have a long history of interaction and deep understanding, and this new relationship should not lead to discord. The American people will certainly continue to observe the prosperity of our Filipino friends with sympathy, concern, and affection."</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Pass the U.S.-Philippine Relations Act - Truman Signs the Filipino Naturalization Act</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 3rd, United Press] The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have passed the government's proposed bill, accepting the administrative agreement signed by President Truman and Philippine President Roxas to implement the Bell Trade Act, which stipulates that close ties between the United States and the Philippines will be maintained for 28 years.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Government Fulfills its Promise - Philippine Independence is Realized - Demonstration to New and Old Imperialism</h3>
<p>The Philippines formally became independent on July 4th. The significance is self-evident. Below is the evaluation of the significance of this independence by U.S. News &amp; World Report:</p>
<p>"It is unprecedented in modern history for a nation to voluntarily grant independence to a racially different, resource-rich colony. The formal realization of this move on July 4th will have a profound impact on colonies and oppressed peoples around the world. This is the United States' response to old Western imperialism and new Eastern imperialism."</p>
<p>The Process of Independence</p>
<p>According to the "Tydings-McDuffie Act" passed by the U.S. Senate in 1934, the Philippines would completely break away from its status as a U.S. colony and begin independence on July 4, 1946.</p>
<p>The Philippines also encountered some twists and turns in its struggle for independence. During the presidential election campaign in 1940, there were two different views on the independence movement in the country. One faction, represented by former President Quezon, supported Philippine independence, while the other faction, represented by Varga, advocated turning the Philippines into a state of the United States and was able to gain the sympathy and support of some Americans. Under these circumstances, Quezon was unable to join hands with another candidate, Osmeña. They formed an agreement, promising that after winning the election, Quezon would serve as president and Osmeña as vice president. Under these superior conditions, Varga was of course defeated.</p>
<p>However, just as the Philippines was advancing towards the road to independence, the Pacific War broke out in 1941. After major changes such as the retreat of the U.S. military, the occupation by the Japanese army, and the return of the U.S. military, the post-war Philippines was naturally significantly different from five years earlier. Therefore, since the Philippines was liberated from the Japanese army, the issue of independence has once again become the focus of discussion. At that time, some people also advocated that the Philippines should not implement independence for the time being. However, the United States had a very clear attitude on this issue. U.S. Senator Tydings immediately went to the local area on behalf of the U.S. President to conduct a very detailed investigation and study after the Philippines was liberated. After returning to the United States, he submitted a report to the President, resolutely advocating that "the independence of the Philippines is already an undoubted issue." U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt also said: "We have promised to grant independence to the Filipinos on July 4, 1946. If the Filipinos do not want to obtain this status, the initiative should belong to the Filipinos. The United States will never take the initiative. The independence of the Philippines is no longer a question. Our work is how to prepare the Filipinos for independence and should firmly move towards this goal." All of this shows how thoroughly the United States is fulfilling its past promises and wants to make its credibility clear to the world.</p>
<p>Roxas Wins</p>
<p>Now, the Philippines has decided to implement independence on July 4th. This is a major good news for the Far East and even the world. We want to congratulate the Filipinos on their bright future!</p>
<p>The first president of the independent Philippines has been decided by the election held in April of this year to be Roxas. In order to explain the political development of the Philippines, let us briefly describe the process of Roxas's election victory.</p>
<p>In this election, there were two powerful presidential candidates: one was Osmeña, who flew to the United States with President Quezon after the outbreak of the Pacific War and the Philippines fell into enemy hands. After Quezon died of illness, he succeeded him as president and returned triumphantly with the U.S. military after the recovery of the Philippines; the other was Roxas, the President of the Philippine Senate, who was able to win the sympathy of the masses, and the underground workers who stayed in the Philippines during the war were also led by Roxas, with outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>Before this election, Osmeña thought he had an absolute advantage because he felt that several points were in his favor: (1) He was still the President of the Philippines at the time, and the existing environmental conditions gave him a lot of convenience; (2) His strong opponent, Roxas, stayed in the Philippines during the war, which was criticized by some people; (3) He condoned the Communist Party in order to gain their support in the election; (4) He had some capitalists behind him to support him. But the result was that Roxas won and Osmeña failed, which was beyond everyone's expectations!</p>
<p>In fact, Roxas's victory was not without reason: (1) He was Quezon's direct descendant and received the support of Mrs. Quezon; (2) He maintained close contact with the guerrillas during the war and gained their trust; (3) He advocated eliminating the Communist Party in order to maintain the security of the entire Philippines; (4) He received support from Spanish capitalists.</p>
<p>In addition, Roxas is an excellent propagandist and politician with a strong sense of nationalism, able to propose moving policies to win the support of the majority of the people. On the other hand, Osmeña is not good at speech, is old and likes to be quiet, and is a little neglectful in all aspects, giving the other party a chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>Roxas has stepped forward to take on a difficult job. He believes in the noble goals and strong capabilities of the United States. Roxas is a powerful and eloquent speaker. He is using his persuasive tongue to win the sympathy of Americans because the Philippines urgently needs economic assistance. Like most savvy Filipinos, he understands the psychology of Americans who like to be flattered. He has received American-style education in the country and has been engaged in American-style politics for more than 20 years. Therefore, he is accustomed to American life. He is at ease in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives, and most congressmen are familiar with him.</p>
<p>Roxas's election foreshadows the arrival of a more progressive and enlightened policy in domestic affairs. In international affairs, in addition to maintaining close friendly relations with the United States, he also hopes to form alliances with China, Siam, France, and the Soviet Union to consolidate its international status. In terms of the global situation, a powerful member will be added to the United Front. In terms of the situation of the United States in the East, it has gained a new ally. The world and the United States should make every effort to help the Philippines consolidate its independence and increase its prosperity. This is very obvious.</p>
<h3>New Dutch Cabinet Established - Prime Minister Beel Concurrently Serves as Minister of Interior - A Compromise Policy Will Be Adopted Toward Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 3rd] The new Dutch cabinet was sworn in before Queen Wilhelmina today. The new cabinet is composed of a mixture of the Catholic Party, the Labor Party, and non-party figures. The list is as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Beel (Catholic Party), Foreign Minister Oostergo (non-party), Minister of Justice Maalseven (Catholic Party), Minister of Education Gielen (Catholic Party), Minister of Finance Lieftinck (Labor Party), Minister of Army and Navy Vefferch (Catholic Party), Minister of Engineering Linjares (non-party), Minister of Transport Voss (Labor Party), Minister of Economic Affairs Schusman (Catholic Party), Minister of Agriculture and Food Mansholt (Labor Party), Minister of Social Welfare Tris (Labor Party), Minister of Overseas Affairs Jockman (non-party), Minister without Portfolio Klyvens (non-party).</p>
<p>The formation of this new cabinet has been delayed because the Labor Party demanded that progressive social policies be implemented and that Indonesia be granted autonomy, all of which must have full guarantees.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 2nd] The new Dutch Prime Minister Beel intends to appoint former Prime Minister Schermerhorn as the High Commissioner to Indonesia to implement the lenient policies of the previous Labor government. Schermerhorn will take office in Batavia, and his authority will exceed that of Acting Governor-General van Mook. According to reliable sources, this matter may be decided by the cabinet tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Indonesian Prime Minister Shariel, who escaped yesterday, announced today that he will go to Yogyakarta, the headquarters of the Indonesian government in central Java, to discuss strong measures to deal with extremists and complete the work of forming a cabinet. It is also learned that Indonesian President Sukarno will meet with leaders of Indonesian political and patriotic groups tomorrow. The people who were kidnapped with Shariel have not yet been rescued, but their whereabouts are clear. Sukarno has ordered their immediate release.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>Dispute Arises Over Voting Rules</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 3rd Radio Broadcast: The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission convened a meeting today to resolve the issue of voting rules. Eleven of the twelve representatives agreed that a majority vote of seven countries would be sufficient to pass a resolution, but the Soviet Union insisted on a number of eight countries.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Meeting - New Differences Arise Over the Management of Trieste</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 3rd Radio Broadcast: Although new differences arose between the Soviet Union and Western countries today regarding the issue of the right to manage Trieste, it is generally believed that a compromise can be reached in the end and a peace conference can be convened this summer.</p>
<h3>The Siamese Government Announced Yesterday That It Has Entered a State of Emergency</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 3rd] The Siamese government announced a state of emergency today. The police are carrying out widespread newspaper censorship. It is reported that several local newspapers will be ordered to cease publication. However, the government did not explain the reason for declaring a state of emergency.</p>
<h3>Moscow Announces That National Prices Have Been Reduced by 40% - Amidst the U.S. Repeal of Price Controls - No Less Than Throwing an "Economic Bomb"</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] The atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll has just been completed, and the Soviet Union has also dropped an economic bomb. Whether it is intentional or not is unknown. According to Moscow's announcement, the market prices of industrial manufactured goods across the country have been reduced by 40%. The United Press believes that since U.S. price controls have disappeared with the end of the Price Administration, this measure may attract significant attention in the United States. The move to actually lower prices has been brewing in the Soviet Union for a long time. The Soviet people undoubtedly believe that it will become a reality. However, there is now a question of how much Soviet prices have actually been reduced in terms of individual purchasing power. According to recent news from Moscow, the true purchasing power of the Soviet people does not lie in how much money they have in their hands, but in how many ration coupons they have for consumption. Rationing varies according to each person's job. It is very cheap to buy rationed goods from stores. Although the amount of rations received by the general public is not enough to make life too comfortable, they can be assured of food and clothing. If they have surplus funds, they can buy goods at special stores, but the goods on display there are not rationed and are very expensive. The Soviet Union's 40% price reduction this time refers to the goods in these special stores. We can therefore know that Soviet people who previously had surplus funds to buy luxury goods and extra supplies will have a more comfortable life in the future. Those who were previously unable to buy luxury goods can now also have their wishes fulfilled. The Soviet Union took measures to reduce prices immediately after the end of U.S. price controls. This timing may not be accidental.</p>
<h3>Okada's Absurd Testimony is Refuted by the United States</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 3rd] Former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada stated yesterday while testifying at the International Court that: "I heard that the United States had a tacit understanding of Japan's advance into Manchuria." A U.S. State Department spokesman immediately denied this, calling it nonsense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] Okada provided false testimony at the International Court yesterday, stating that U.S. restrictions on immigration forced Japan, with its surplus population, to develop towards Manchuria. Okada claimed that there was a gentleman's agreement between the United States and Japan, recognizing Japan's continental expansion policy. This clearly refers to the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of November 1917. At that time, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing had a letter stating: "The governments of the United States and Japan recognize that territorial proximity creates special relationships between countries. Therefore, the U.S. government recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, especially in parts of China contiguous to its territory." Okada pointed out that this was a signal to Japan to expand to Manchuria. However, the Lansing-Ishii Agreement also bound both parties to respect China's sovereignty and the Open Door Policy. When the International Court continued its trial today, Tojo's lawyer Kiyose also said that Japanese immigration to Manchuria and Korea was influenced by U.S. immigration restrictions, which became one of the causes of the Pacific War. Chief Judge Webb said: "We do not pay attention to immigration, but only want to question the war." Kiyose replied: "Japanese colonization of Manchuria and Korea was one of the causes of the war."</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Passes Principles of the New Japanese Constitution</h3>
<p>Content Kept Secret</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The Far Eastern Commission unanimously passed the fundamental principles of the new Japanese constitution today in order to establish a democratic government in Japan. The resolution has been sent to MacArthur for comparison with the new constitution submitted to the Diet by Emperor Hirohito earlier this year. However, the representatives of the Far Eastern Commission are unwilling to reveal the content of the resolution and have agreed to keep it secret pending consultation with MacArthur. However, it is reported that conditions are attached, hoping to be included in the new constitution.</p>
<h3>US Navy Announces Plan: Constructing a Grand Defensive Network, Bases Spanning Both Oceans and Across the Equator, Eliminating the Need for Island Hopping Tactics Thereafter</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd dispatch] The US Navy is completing a post-war major base system to consolidate the defense of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. This base system spans the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and extends north and south of the equator, including submarine and naval air facilities. In the event of war, it will eliminate the need for island-hopping tactics, avoiding unnecessary troop losses. Once this grand defensive system is established, it will make a great contribution to maintaining lasting world peace. Details of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Atlantic bases will include Antigua and St. Lucia in the British West Indies, Argentia in northern Newfoundland, and Great Exuma Island in the British Bahamas near the southwest coast of Florida. In the Pacific, the system will stretch from the Aleutian Islands to the Philippines, Australia, Palmyra Island (a US territory), and back to Honolulu. Within this vast triangle, the US Navy will fortify previously overlooked islands such as Eniwetok, Majuro, Kwajalein, Ryukyu, and Manus Island.</p>
<p>Two Ocean Bases Linked Together</p>
<p>A total of thirty-nine locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will be linked in this vast plan. However, many are under foreign administration, requiring prior agreement before construction can proceed. Manus Island, located a few miles north of New Guinea, has long been overlooked. It is about 4,000 miles from Honolulu, and few Caucasians have seen it. However, it plays a significant role in the US plan to defeat Japan, which has brought it prominence. The island is not large but has a natural harbor capable of accommodating at least a thousand ships. The US Navy built a major operational base there during the war. Manus Island was originally part of German New Guinea in the Pacific. After World War I, the League of Nations entrusted Australia with its administration.</p>
<p>Manus Island: Important Stronghold</p>
<p>The US Navy calls Manus Island an indispensable stronghold in its Pacific defense plan. However, Australia is still hesitant to grant the US Navy the necessary privileges. The reasons for this hesitation remain to be explained in detail. The US State Department and the Australian Department of External Affairs are discussing the matter, and the US Navy is confident that permission will be granted once negotiations are complete. In addition, the US Navy plans to build air bases on islands scattered within 1,800 miles southwest of Pearl Harbor, such as Johnston, Palmyra, and Canton Islands. Both the United States and Great Britain claim sovereignty over these islands, but it should not be difficult to reach an agreement for base construction. In the Central Pacific, there are eight Japanese mandated territories, now under US control, where naval air bases will be established. The US Navy will also construct secondary operational bases in Adak in the Aleutian Islands and in the Philippines. Adak belongs to the United States, and negotiations are underway regarding the Philippines.</p>
<p>Using Taiwan: Requires Prior Negotiation</p>
<p>Guam and Saipan are another important point in the Pacific defense system. Located about 1,500 miles south of Japan, they are the westernmost operational bases of the United States and are currently under construction. Ryukyu, only a few hundred miles from mainland Japan, will also have an operational base established there after being captured by the US Navy. The US Seventh Fleet is currently stationed in Chinese waters, but this is temporary. The US Navy has no permanent facilities along the Chinese coast. Taiwan could become a port of call for the US fleet, but this requires prior negotiation with China. The US Twelfth Fleet is stationed in Japan to support General MacArthur and his occupation forces. Its stay will depend on needs, but Japan is not included in the US Navy's Pacific defense plan.</p>
<p>West Indies Defense Deployment</p>
<p>The main defensive network in the Atlantic is the Caribbean region. The US Navy hopes to construct facilities on Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, as well as Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, British Guiana, and Trinidad in the British West Indies. All of these islands are under the British flag. The Caribbean region also includes Guantanamo, belonging to Cuba; San Juan and Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico; St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands; Coco Solo at the eastern end of the Panama Canal; and Balboa on the Pacific side of the Canal Zone. In the North Atlantic, the US Navy plans to build facilities in Iceland and Greenland, the latter currently owned by Denmark. Besides obtaining the necessary bases and constructing facilities, the main challenge for the US Navy is securing the manpower needed for occupation and maintenance. As for ships, there are ample resources to meet the needs of this two-ocean defense plan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Research Institute Develops New Radar Optical Device</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 2nd dispatch] TASS announced today that a certain Soviet experimental research institute has successfully tested the world's smallest machine, a radar optical device with a small aperture, only one four-thousandth of a [unit of measurement, likely an inch].</p>
<h3>Conclusions on the Power of the Atomic Bomb: US Navy Secretary Says Navy Can Still Be Preserved; Admiral Cunningham Holds the Same View</h3>
<p>Second Test to Be Held on the 22nd</p>
<p>[Reuters Bikini Atoll, 2nd dispatch] US Navy Secretary Forrestal announced today after inspecting the damaged ships that two conclusions can be drawn from this atomic bomb test: (1) Heavily armored battleships are still not easy to sink unless their underwater parts are also damaged. (2) The status of the Navy can still be preserved. The most surprising result of this test is that battleships suffered the least damage. Two goats on the battleship "Pennsylvania" are still alive and well, grazing on the ship. However, experts predict that the two goats will succumb to the pressure of the waves. It is learned that all seventy-three target ships sustained varying degrees of damage. Lightweight equipment on the deck, such as radar and nets, was severely damaged.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 2nd dispatch] Admiral Cunningham, Chief of Naval Staff, told the press association today that regardless of the existence of the atomic bomb, the British Navy still believes that sea power is the decisive force in war. The atomic bomb may have a destructive effect on battleships berthed in fixed locations at sea, but such effects would never occur in actual combat.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse dispatch] The second atomic bomb test will be held on the 22nd, with the bomb detonating 25 feet underwater. According to Commander Blandy, the warships that were not sunk in the first test will be turned into islands at that time.</p>
<h3>Zionist Movement: US Promises Assistance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 2nd dispatch] A presidential spokesman said that President Truman, when receiving the American representatives of the Zionist movement committee today, expressed regret over the recent developments in Palestine. The President was informed that the British government did not consult with him before raiding the Jerusalem Zionist Committee headquarters. He will do his best to assist 100,000 Jews in moving to Palestine, and the United States is prepared to bear various technical and economic responsibilities in transporting the immigrants. He hopes that the detained Jewish leaders will be released and that order will be restored to its original state.</p>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem, 2nd dispatch] It is learned that Hayfa Jewish leader, Dav Hai, who was arrested on Saturday, has been released.</p>
<p>Detained Jews Suffered Torture</p>
<p>[United Press London, 2nd dispatch] The Palestinian Jewish Congress today accused the Palestinian police of torturing detained Jews, causing severe injuries and possibly permanent disabilities to many. Some were even subjected to humiliation, having their genitals pulled, and being forced to hold stones under their armpits for hours.</p>

<h3>President Song Convenes Leaders of the Shipping Industry to Discuss Ways to Protect Maritime Rights; Accepts Seven Urgent Recommendations from Attending Representatives; Order to Open Coastal Ports Will Be Rescinded Immediately</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song Ziwen, consulted with leaders of the shipping industry, including Du [name], Qian Yongming, Yang Jinbei, Li Yunliang, and Huang Haoyun, about the recent situation of the shipping industry and discussed genuine ways to protect maritime rights and develop the shipping industry in the future. The representatives detailed various difficulties and sufferings encountered by the shipping industry in our country, based on facts, especially emphasizing the crisis of foreign merchants infringing on maritime rights, and suggested the following urgent measures:</p>
<p>(1) Revoke the original proposal to open the four ports of the Yangtze River for inland navigation rights. To save on transshipment costs, it can be stipulated that ships purchased by our country from the United States will preferentially transport materials to the ports of the Yangtze River. Moreover, among the surplus ships in the United States, there are many suitable for ocean navigation. Our country can take this opportunity to open up ocean routes, without attracting foreign ships to the Yangtze River, which would affect maritime rights. (2) Cancel the contract for the Executive Yuan to lease British ships. This contract expires on the 16th of this month. For the past six months, British ships have been transporting large quantities of commercial goods under the guise of transporting relief supplies, which has led to many abuses. Currently, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has thirty-nine seagoing ships, totaling 140,000 tons. Relief supplies have averaged 22,390 tons per month for the past six months. Even if this figure is doubled or tripled, it is still not much. There is definitely no need to continue leasing foreign ships. (3) Cancel the order to open coastal ports. According to the announcement by the Jianghai Customs, "The General Taxation Department has forwarded the telegram from the Ministry of Finance No. 22828, which stated that the Executive Yuan has ordered that the transportation of goods and passengers between ports in China is limited to Chinese ships. Foreign merchant ships employed by government agencies, for the purpose of post-war relief, may temporarily travel between ports to transport goods and passengers until March 31, 1947. This is hereby announced." The previous order led to many abuses. On June 24, the British Ocean Steam Ship Company's Newchwang vessel, under the guise of transporting 200 tons of flour, carried 2,500 tons of commercial goods, with freight amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan, which is sufficient evidence. This order should be expressly canceled to protect maritime rights and prevent abuses. (4) Assist in the purchase of British shipping assets in China. According to the provisions of the Equal Treaty, Great Britain has given up its rights to inland and coastal navigation in China. The Chinese government is prepared to purchase its existing shipping assets at a fair price. Currently, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire, are attempting to continue manipulating our country's maritime rights under the guise of being registered as Chinese companies. The government should promptly negotiate with the British side to transfer the wharves, warehouses, and ships along the Yangtze River and the sea. If these foreign firms register companies with Chinese-British joint ventures with our government, the government should verify whether Chinese shares actually account for more than two-thirds, in compliance with Article 3 of the Maritime Law, to prevent concealment. (5) Assist shipping companies in purchasing ships. Chinese shipping companies sacrificed 300,000 tons of ships in this war and urgently need relief and support. The US Congress has passed a bill to sell surplus ships, with the price calculated at a percentage of the original construction cost. The first payment is 25 percent, and the remaining amount is paid in installments over 20 years. We implore the government to purchase a large number of ships suitable for our country's waterways from the United States and transfer them to private shipping companies under the original conditions. (6) Reorganize the Shanghai port administration. Please establish a Shanghai Port Authority, referring to the Qingdao port administration regulations, to reorganize and construct Shanghai's warehouses and wharves, or establish a Shanghai Wharf and Warehouse Company to actively operate them. And clearly declare Shanghai as a major port in the East, to replace the original plan to build a major port in Zhapu in the industrial plan, and to expedite the opening of existing wharves and warehouses. (7) Determine shipping policy. Although our country's shipping policy was repeatedly discussed and agreed upon by a small group meeting convened by the Supreme National Defense Council before the end of the war, it has not yet been announced. Since the restoration, the domestic shipping industry urgently needs to be established, especially with the active support of the government to meet transportation needs. The government should promptly make a decision and formulate laws to maintain maritime rights for a long time. After listening to the representatives' opinions, Mr. Song expressed that most of them could be accepted. However, regarding the cancellation of the order to open coastal ports and the Executive Yuan's lease contract, they can be implemented immediately. A policy to establish and support private shipping companies will also be announced in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Director of the Health Bureau Is Anxious; The Time Epidemic Hospital Uses 800 Pounds of Salt Water Daily; Cholera Prevention Is Very Easy: Do Not Eat Raw Cold Dishes, Eat Cooked Dishes</h3>
<p>With a sad mood, the reporter reports to all sectors the experience of visiting the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital, to tell readers that the spread of cholera has entered an unrestrained stage!</p>
<p>There are a total of nine time epidemic hospitals in Shanghai now, but none of them do not declare "full"! The gate of the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital is hung with a sign that reads "The wards of this hospital are full, there are no empty beds", but there are still many people coming to the hospital in tricycles, rickshaws, and rattan chairs with patients, and their families are surrounding them, busy rubbing the cramping limbs of the patient, while begging the hospital authorities bitterly, but the answer of the person in charge is: "Hospitalization is absolutely impossible, we can only give you a life-saving injection, and if it is not good, please carry it home, if it is not good, come back for another injection".</p>
<p>This is not the cruelty of the hospital, seeing death without saving, but it is really "powerless", now the corridors and patios of the hospital have become temporary wards, there is no space to accommodate patients, about four or five people are discharged from the hospital after treatment every morning, but in less than two hours, it will be filled again! The later people can only "be beaten back". The working atmosphere in the hospital is now extremely tense, all facilities are working day and night, the average doctor works eight hours a day, the nurse works twelve hours, the busy situation of sweating and sweating is definitely not under the war hospital.</p>
<p>According to the dean of the hospital, Na Qingshan, the spread of cholera has also spread to the middle and upper classes, and there are patients from the education, banking, and money shops in these days, and once a banker's wife stayed in the corridor overnight because there was no room.</p>
<p>The hospital is equipped with a hunger injection room, and all those who need to be injected with salt water are carried into the room by the ward for injection. Most patients continue to diarrhea while injecting salt water. People with cholera, after diarrhea, the stool is pure clear water, after injecting a large amount of salt water, the diarrhea can be stopped, the hospital's salt water is self-prepared, an average of 800 pounds per day.</p>
<p>According to Dean Deng: In the hospital's past experience, the oldest was seventy-seven years old, and the youngest was eight days. Originally, there was a child who was born prematurely, this child was not born at the right time, on the eighth day, unfortunately, the mother was infected with cholera, an eight-day-old baby, must taste the taste of salt water, but fortunately, the mother and child are safe. Finally, Dean Deng told reporters that cholera is not impossible to prevent, and cholera bacteria are very easy to die, as long as you do not drink raw water on weekdays, cook the vegetables, soak the melon in boiling water, you can ensure safety.</p>
<p>After the reporter left the Shanghai Time Epidemic Hospital, I felt that the situation was really too serious, so I rushed to the Municipal Health Bureau to visit Director Zhang Wei. According to Director Zhang, in order to the severity of the epidemic, he has been unable to sleep peacefully for many days, and he can't wait to have a few more hours in a day so that the people of the Health Bureau can step up their work. (Sacred Heart)</p>
<p>UN Relief to Fly in Medicine</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd dispatch] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that UNRRA plans to fly urgently needed medicines and equipment worth 30,000 yuan to Shanghai to combat cholera. The airborne drugs will be shipped from San Francisco to Shanghai. Air transport takes only six days, while shipping takes about three weeks.</p>
<p>Be More Careful After the Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday's heavy rain caused flooding in low-lying areas, with waterlogging, and sewers clogged. Cholera bacteria spread extremely quickly. I hope that citizens will pay extra attention. Yesterday, there were sixty-eight patients with cholera and seven deaths. Including the previous cases, there were a total of 1,034 patients and eighty-one deaths, including three Soviet nationals and one Australian national.</p>
<h3>Spectacle of Heavy Rain: Boats on Land, American Soldiers Having Fun, Rickshaws Thriving Threefold; Shanghai Estimated to Be One-Third Submerged</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is said that these past two days of heavy rain are due to the effects of atomic bombs. Meteorologists are divided into two factions, some acknowledging it and others denying it. We don't know the truth, but at least this heavy rain is unprecedented in recent years, which is a fact. According to yesterday's report by Director Zheng Zizheng of the Weather Bureau, yesterday's rainfall totaled 97 millimeters, equivalent to about 3.9 inches. "Such heavy rain should stop today," Director Zheng said.</p>
<p>Welcoming the flood are children, who play in the water, causing adults to groan incessantly. In the western part of Shanghai, from Avenue Joffre to Route Albert, including Yu Garden Road, Route Dufour, Route Haig, Route Tenant de la Tour, Route de Grosse-Grosse, and others, are all flooded. Tall buildings such as Hua Apartment, the International Hotel, and Wing On Company all look like they are built on islands. Trams have stopped running, and red buses carry heavier loads than usual, shuttling back and forth on roads without standing water. Rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are enjoying a hundredfold increase in business. One crossing costs five hundred or a thousand [dollars], and for longer distances, the fare exceeds the cost of a business trip by car. In the deep-water areas of the Western District, American soldiers are floating around in rubber rafts. To them, land sailing must seem like a miracle. Many cars are helping to push vehicles stuck in the water, earning some extra money. Water has flooded the sidewalks, and shop assistants are taking a leisurely break, simply closing their doors.</p>
<p>The plaza of the Social Affairs Bureau on Avenue Joffre has become a large pool. On Rue Massenet, a child of about ten years old fell into the water and took the opportunity to swim. The water is above the knee, and even long boots are useless. After sewage seeped into the long boots, the reporter took a rickshaw back. About one-third of the entire Shanghai area is submerged in water.</p>
<p>According to meteorologists, Shanghai is experiencing a period of prolonged rainfall. After this, there will likely be twenty more days of rain. Boots and raincoats are once again in demand.</p>
<h3>"A Shower on the Third Day of the Sixth Lunar Month: Plowing Rice in the Morning, Sleeping in the Afternoon" More Flooding Expected This Month; Director Zhao Greets Reporters After the Rain, Reports on Inspection of Flooded Areas</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Yearbook of 1935, the average rainfall in July is 150.4 centimeters, with a record high of 369.5 centimeters. Also, according to the Zikawei Observatory, the rainfall on March 27 of this year reached 65 centimeters, the highest in fifteen years. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the rainfall from 9 AM the day before yesterday to 9 AM yesterday reached 90 centimeters (3.5 inches), exceeding the March 27 rainfall by slightly less than one-third.</p>
<p>Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, personally inspected the post-rain conditions in various districts from early yesterday morning to the afternoon. The most severe flooding was in areas around Central Lin Sen Road, South Mau Ming Road, East Si Nan Road, North Tian Tong Road, Chekiang Road, Fan Yu Road, Jiao Zhou Road, Kang Ding Road, and the eastern section of Yu Garden Road. Director Zhao specifically met with reporters from various newspapers at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on the causes of the flooding: (1) Excessive rainfall, coinciding with high tide. The water level reached a maximum of 12.1 feet above the surface at 3:04 AM yesterday, and a maximum of 10.65 feet at 3:39 PM in the afternoon. Low-lying roads are generally 10 to 11 feet above the water surface. Director Zhao also said: "As the saying goes, 'A shower on the third day of the sixth lunar month: Plowing rice in the morning, sleeping in the afternoon.' More flooding is expected this month." (2) Small water pipes, making drainage difficult. There are currently seven pumping stations, including the stations on Macgregor Road, Foochow Road, Fukien Road, Tientsin Road, Chefoo Road, Nanking Road, Szechuen Road, Woosung Road, North Szechuen Road, Chapoo Road, East Chung Cheng Road Bund, Foochow Road Bund and Bazih Road Bund, with the Macgregor Road station being the largest. Each station started pumping water at 3 AM yesterday, so the water on Avenue Edward VII and Rue Molière has receded slightly, but Kang Ding Road is not showing results because the diameter of the pipe is only twelve [inches]. (3) The dredging work is incomplete. The bureau's dredging of the Laohua Creek will be completed in two weeks, and the Zhaojia Creek will be completed by the end of the month. Currently, dams are being built and mud is being dredged, so the water flow is obstructed. This was dismantled yesterday morning. At the same time, the sewer grates are clogged with garbage and have not been cleaned in eight years, making it difficult to clear them.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Obscene Publications to Continue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau has decided to severely crack down on publications that promote indecency and piracy in the city. Last week, they confiscated all eight types of books, including "The Flirtatious Widow" and "The Sister-in-Law in the Family." In addition, thirty-three types of obscene publications that were not registered with the Central Propaganda Department were also banned from sale, and the Booksellers Association was notified not to handle their distribution.</p>
<h3>American Independence Day in Shanghai: Memories of Today Nine Years Ago</h3>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, every year on July 4th, American officials and civilians in Shanghai would celebrate this glorious anniversary. Especially in 1937, two days before the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the celebration was the most enthusiastic. Newspaper reports at the time described it as "three days of revelry" because July 4th that year happened to fall on a Sunday, so they started from the 3rd and continued until the 5th. It might be interesting to compare the schedule of those three days with today's first anniversary after the victory:</p>
<p>July 3rd: 3:30 PM, horse races and basketball games. 9:00 PM, officials and civilians gathered at the Columbia Country Club to watch fireworks and hold a grand ball. The American machine gun squad of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps chartered a ferry for a night cruise on the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>July 4th: 10:00 AM, the U.S. Marine Corps held a large-scale service at the Cathay Theater. U.S. Consul General Hillel McCormick gave a speech on the history of American construction, and there was instrumental music and the national anthem.</p>
<p>July 5th: All U.S. agencies were closed to celebrate. 8:00 AM, flag-raising and military parade at the racecourse. 12:00 PM, a grand tea party was held at the Columbia Country Club for Chinese and foreign officials. Mayor Yu Hongjun, Commander Yang [blank], and consuls from various countries attended, with no fewer than four hundred people in attendance. There was a race at the racecourse.</p>
<p>Seeing the above record, one cannot help but feel a sense of "what a grand occasion!" That revelry did seem to have some "foresight" because before long, the flames of war in China spread from the north throughout the country. From 1938 onwards, because we were in the midst of great difficulty, U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson issued an order to officials and civilians in various regions not to celebrate excessively, so the July 4th holidays in the following years were spent quietly. After the Japanese occupied the concessions, under the slogan of anti-British and anti-Americanism, American officials and civilians had to spend their bleak years in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Time has overturned everything, and time has also restored everything to the "USA" era. The first July 4th after the victory has arrived. The U.S. celebration program has already been published in detail in yesterday's newspaper. However, due to the sudden rain, outdoor activities will be moved to the 7th.</p>
<p>Seeing the revelry of other countries' national days, and looking back at our own devastated land, every Chinese person cannot help but feel a little sad. But considering President Thomas Jefferson's brilliant declaration of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," we can once again be given unlimited encouragement today! (Feihong)</p>
<h3>Philippine Independence Celebration</h3>

<h3>Kang Yihang's Appeal in the New Asia Hotel Case Is Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous New Asia Hotel in this city, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Tian Tong Road, was originally built on land leased from Zhang Danru. At the end of 1933, a contract was signed for a term of twenty years, stipulating that if the rent was not paid for two consecutive years, the owner could revoke the lease. During the "August 13th" Shanghai Incident, the hotel was occupied by the enemy for a long time, and the owner was also replaced by the Danish Kang Yihang. After the victory, Kang Yi, the legal representative of the bank, filed a lawsuit with the civil court of the Shanghai District Court against the legal representative of the Asia Hotel, claiming to revoke the surface rights based on the contract.

<h3>United Press Responds to Chen Guolian: Denies Malicious Defamation; Second Batch of Repatriated German侨 Sent to Concentration Camps</h3>
<p>[United Press, July 3rd] Regarding the previous United Press report that Chinese officials had accepted bribes to change the list in the case of the evacuation of German residents from Shanghai, Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sent a letter to the United Press on the 2nd, questioning that this was slander and insult to his office and demanding that he provide actual evidence and point out the names of people. The United Press replied to Chen on the 3rd, stating that the United Press's message did not specify who or which organization accepted the bribes, so there was no defamation of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the bribe-takers may have been other parties. Moreover, it is investigating the truth about the evacuation of German residents, so what the agency reported cannot be described as malicious defamation.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to statistics from the German Puppet Management Committee, there are a total of more than 2,100 German residents in this city. Among them, except for those who are temporarily ill (certified by Chinese and American doctors), those who have married foreigners and have dual nationality, those who have divorced Germans, and those who need to be interrogated because they are Nazi party members, will be repatriated to the country. Yesterday was the date for the second batch to be sent to concentration camps, totaling 463 people. Together with the day before yesterday, a total of 702 people will leave Shanghai on the 7th. According to the authorities of the association, the list of Nazi German residents listed by the association is completely consistent with the list investigated by the American side, so it is wrong to spread rumors that there are espionage cases.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Industry Association Demands: Revision of Rental Management Rules; Protection of the Property Rights of Legitimate Owners; Abolition of the Second-Hand Landlord System as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the housing shortage in this city has been serious, and rental disputes have arisen one after another. The Commercial Association of the Real Estate Industry in this city has, in view of this, recently petitioned the Municipal Government, requesting that the "Housing Rental Management Rules" be revised. The reasons are divided into three points: (1) The rules were based on the end of the war, and the item has been repealed. Moreover, the rules stipulate that the lease between the landlord and the tenant must be registered and reviewed, which is beyond the scope stipulated in the original rules. (2) Rental disputes have always been handled by the judicial organs. According to the Civil Procedure Law, housing disputes and other cases must first be mediated by the court. If mediation fails, a lawsuit can be filed. Now the rules also have provisions for mediation, which is not in line with the separation of judicial power. (3) The rules stipulate that all lease contracts must be registered with the committee and reviewed by it, and the amount of rent is repeatedly restricted, which inevitably infringes on the people's freedom to enter into contracts. At the same time, the association also reached the following points: (1) The sovereignty of the owner should be respected, and legitimate profits should be given. At present, the power to dispose of houses in this city is completely in the hands of the second landlord, and the legitimate owner has become a state of having property but no power, and the industry is not independent. Therefore, the sovereignty of the owner should be respected first, so that he has the right to defend himself from the illegal occupation of tenants. The current burden of the owner is extremely heavy, such as land donations, housing donations, deed tax, stamp tax, rental income tax, insurance premiums, and housing management fees, which are huge in number, and rental income often does not cover expenses, and many houses have not been repaired after the incident and are in danger of collapse. It seems that the expenditure should be reviewed in detail, and at least the industry should be preserved to avoid accompanying the accumulation. (2) The legitimate rights and interests of the original tenants should be protected, and the landlord or Luo Rent should not be allowed to have foreign languages, or to recover and sublet, etc., but at the same time, tenants should also be restricted from illegally occupying the owner's behavior, such as the current second landlord, arbitrarily subletting the owner's house and charging high rents, arbitrarily bidding to obtain the top fee, arbitrarily subletting, and mainly bearing unnecessary repair losses. (Should) Those who have not obtained housing should have the opportunity to rent a house. On the positive side, the property rights of legitimate owners should be protected, and reasonable rental standards should be stipulated, so that investors are happy to build new houses, and those who build new houses should also be rewarded. On the passive side, the second landlord system should be abolished as soon as possible, so that the three tenants can directly sign a lease with the owner, then all the disputes arising from the second landlord will naturally be reduced. (4) Contact should be established with the court and the affiliate to avoid the disadvantages of separation and divergence. If the rules are complicated and cannot be revised, it is better to abolish them immediately and listen to the people's freedom to make contracts, and the disputes will be handled by the judiciary, so as to avoid the government from having orders that are not followed, and the people from having the pain of being動　得咎.</p>

<h3>Revision of University Curriculum Standards – Ministry of Education Continuing Research</h3>
<p>[Special Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education's revision of elementary school curriculum standards was mostly finalized at a meeting of experts held in Shanghai last month and will soon be implemented. The revision of secondary school curriculum standards was discussed at a meeting held by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing before the recovery. There is a plan, but the ministry will convene experts from various regions to discuss further once all schools have been restored. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is also continuously conducting research into the revision of university curriculum standards. The revision of the curriculum for the faculties of Arts, Sciences, Law, and Education has reached a significant stage. After the recovery, the curriculum for the faculties of Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce, and Medicine will also be revised in their entirety. The trend of the revision is to appropriately allocate the hours for compulsory courses, reduce the burden on students, reduce the hours for unnecessary subjects, and increase students' extracurricular activities to regulate their physical and mental development. Special attention is being paid to the curriculum for the first year of university. Considering that the level of high school graduates in the recovered areas does not fully meet the standards, all universities and independent colleges have now been ordered to establish university preparatory classes. This allows students who do not meet the standards or who were not admitted to university to pursue further studies in the preparatory classes. The new university curriculum standards should be raised accordingly. Students with weaker levels can connect with the new university curriculum standards through remedial classes in the preparatory classes. Therefore, the curriculum for the first year of university will be appropriately revised to avoid repetition and prevent waste. (Reporter's Note: During the period when Shanghai was occupied and had concessions, Jiangsu Provincial schools resumed classes in Shanghai, and some famous high schools in Shanghai often used textbooks that were at the level of the first semester of university in the final stage of high school English, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry courses.)</p>

Now that the Northeast has been recovered, but the school buildings have been destroyed, the former Japanese No. 1 Middle School is being temporarily used as the campus, and preparations for the re-establishment of the school are being actively carried out. It is expected that classes will begin after the autumn, and the faculties of Arts, Law, and Science will be established first.</p>
<h3>World Education Conference - Chinese Representative Gu Yuqi's Speech</h3>

Mr. Gu also said that the Economic and Social Intellectual Council will hold a meeting in Paris on November 4 this year, and all cultural issues will be submitted for discussion.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest in Northern and Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Bengbu Vocational School Students Oppose Principal Yang - Accuse Principal of Corruption and Monitor Principal, Depriving Him of Freedom</p>
<p>Hangzhou Normal School Students Oppose Principal Zhu - Accuse Principal of Favoritism and Demand Dismissal by the Department of Education</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Bengbu] On the evening of June 27, students at the Anhui Provincial Industrial Vocational School requested that the school provide each student with several thousand yuan from the provincial subsidy for rice, food, and other expenses before the end of the semester in order to return home.</p>
<p>Organize a Committee to Settle Accounts with the Principal</p>
<p>Principal Yang Chengcheng did not agree. The students expressed their dissatisfaction and immediately organized a liquidation committee to settle accounts with the principal and monitor the actions of the principal and faculty members. On the 28th, they published the matter in the Wanbei Daily in the name of all the students, accusing Principal Yang of corruption, withholding internship fees, forcing students to subsidize teachers' meals, stealing and selling school bricks and stones, and forging the private seals of faculty members and students when handling reimbursements last semester. The school originally planned to hold a major exam but was unable to do so. That afternoon, Wang Zhongtian, an old provincial scholar in Bengbu, and Zhu Zhuoren, the chief of the education section of the municipal office, went to mediate but were unsuccessful. According to student representatives speaking to reporters: There are currently fewer than 150 students in the entire school, divided into one class in the textile department and two classes in the civil engineering department. Now that this matter has occurred, we hope that people from all walks of life will uphold justice and provide assistance. However, according to Principal Yang: This matter is indeed unfortunate for our school. Students are welcome to check the accounts, but I hope they will not escalate the situation. As of the 30th, the school gate was still being guarded by students. Many teachers have regained their freedom, but Principal Yang and the clerk are still being monitored and unable to exercise their duties. The faculty members hope for a peaceful resolution so that they can take a vacation and return home as soon as possible. (Chao)</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Approximately 200 students at Hangzhou Normal School opposed Principal Zhu Wenzhi and demanded the expulsion of arsonist student Wu Changchong. They wrote and issued a declaration to the public and posted激烈的 slogans everywhere.</p>
<p>March in Formation - Petition the Provincial Government</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM on the 1st of this month, they marched in formation to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to petition. At that time, the provincial government auditorium was holding a memorial week. Secretary-General Lei received the student representatives on behalf of the government, informing them that it was not necessary to march in formation to petition. Subsequently, Section Chief Luo of the Department of Education inquired about the reasons from the students and advised them. The students accused Principal Zhu of neglecting school affairs and protecting student Wu Changchong, who had been absent from class and set fire. Finally, they proposed two demands: (1) to demand the dismissal of Principal Zhu, and (2) to expel student Wu Changchong. They then returned in formation. If the petition's purpose is not achieved, the students will not leave the school for a day. According to Li Bohong, the director of school affairs: This incident originated in April this year when students suspected that their classmate Wu Changchong was suffering from venereal disease and asked the school to expel him. However, after being diagnosed by Zheng Shuzheng, the school doctor, it was found that he did not have venereal disease but rather balanitis. However, Wu's behavior was usually inappropriate, so Principal Zhu did not expel him for the sake of cultivating talent since the semester was already halfway over. The students blamed the principal for this matter. After the arson incident occurred, they believed that it was Wu who did it and肆意 attacked Principal Zhu for allowing students to set fire. At that time, Wu was sent to court for questioning due to the arson case. As a result, there was no conclusive evidence, and he was ordered to post bail. Because he was in a foreign land and had no relatives, Shen Xi, the director of general affairs of the school, acted as his guarantor out of the relationship between teachers and students. Therefore, the students were even more dissatisfied.</p>

<h3>City Elementary School Principals Suggest to the Education Bureau - Levy Respect-for-Teachers Rice</h3>
<p>And Levy School Building Construction Fees from Students</p>
<p>[City News] The council of the City Elementary School Principals Association held its third regular meeting at Fuchun Elementary School on Shaanxi Road last night. Chairman Chai Zifei presided over the meeting and resolved the following major cases: (1) In order to improve teachers' lives and stabilize teachers' work in the next semester, it is suggested that the Education Bureau levy respect-for-teachers rice from students in accordance with the Ministry's order. (2) The Ministry of Education stipulates that each school's office expenses account for 25% of the school's total funding, but the office expenses currently issued by the Education Bureau average only about one thirty-fifth of the total, making it difficult for each school to handle affairs. Please increase office expenses in the next semester. (3) In order to improve the quality of each school, school buildings, equipment, etc., do not meet the standards. Given the lack of funds in the municipal treasury, it is feared that there will be no money for this, and because the students are the beneficiaries of improving the school's environment and equipment, it is suggested that the Education Bureau levy construction fees from the students.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Registration of Foreign Companies: Five Opinions from the President of the American Chamber of Commerce; The Exact Number of American Businesses in Shanghai Cannot Yet Be Ascertained</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Our reporter, in order to understand the opinions of foreign businesses regarding company registration, specifically visited Mr. Pan De, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city. He stated: Since the revised New Company Law was promulgated, most American businesses in this city are very willing to go to the authorities to handle registration procedures. During several meetings of the American Chamber of Commerce, the American businesses all expressed willingness to prepare for registration. However, during the preparation process, there are still some issues that are deemed worthy of study: (1) The registration steps seem to be too complicated. The registration procedures for American businesses in the United States are very simple. Furthermore, the credit information that must be filled out during registration is also more complex. Some credit information is deemed by the American businesses to be necessary to maintain its confidentiality in business, so it seems inappropriate to fill it out. (2) The collection of taxes and levies has no fixed standard. Currently, the largest expense for American businesses operating in Shanghai is employee salaries, followed by payable taxes and levies. The current tax system has no standards and is too complicated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to simplify the collection process. (3) The Sino-American Commercial Treaty has not yet been finalized. This treaty regulates the operation of commerce between China and the United States. Therefore, before the content of the treaty is clarified, businesses on both sides of China and the United States feel somewhat at a loss as to how to develop their future business. (4) American businesses operating in China have no special hopes. They are extremely willing to cooperate with all parties to promote trade between them. Therefore, it is hoped that the regulations of various laws in China will not be too strict, lest they prevent the development of normal business. He said: After the United States declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China in 1943, it re-signed the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship. This treaty stipulated that it was reciprocal in nature. However, recently, China stipulated that foreigners residing in the interior must still go to the police stations to complete endorsement procedures. However, Chinese residing in various places in the United States do not need to complete these endorsement procedures. This move also hinders the development of foreign businesses in China. (5) Some businesses operated by the government, or their agencies, tend to monopolize various undertakings after participating in them. For example, recently, the customs often temporarily restricts the import of certain imported goods. This makes foreign businesses feel extremely uncertain. Furthermore, the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce are also different between China and the United States. The Social Bureau stipulates that the Chamber of Commerce belongs to the nature of a public association. All members must bear considerable responsibility for the actions of any member. This is not the case in the United States. The American Chamber of Commerce is only an organization where representatives of several members meet. Mr. Pan then stated: American businesses do not currently hope to be given preferential conditions in law, but hope that all regulations will not discriminate against American businesses. In conclusion, he said: The above are only a few examples of the obvious ones. Mr. Pan did not want to complain about the difficult situation faced by foreign businesses. However, he said that if the relevant authorities consult, he will provide many constructive suggestions.</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the registration of American companies from Ms. Smith, the representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association in China. She stated that since the revised New Company Law was promulgated, American businesses remaining in China have been preparing to handle registration procedures. Some have already registered with the Chinese Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is estimated that before the Pacific War, there were about one hundred American businesses in Shanghai. Since Japan's surrender, some American businesses have come to Shanghai to resume operations, while others have closed down and returned to their countries due to the temporary inability to develop their businesses. Therefore, the exact number of American businesses in Shanghai is currently being investigated and counted.</p>
<p>According to the original text: The Social Bureau stipulates that members of the Chamber of Commerce must bear considerable responsibility for the actions of any member, which is not the case in the United States. As far as we know, the Social Bureau has no such regulations, nor are there such regulations in central laws. It has been heard that British and American merchants have filed a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this matter. It is unknown how this misunderstanding arose.</p>
<h3>Extremely Tight Money Supply, High Interest Rates; Gold Prices Forced to Fall; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Feel Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Shachi first hung up high the decorated gold of small silver shops from the day before, opening in the morning at 2.02 million, but it was only a flash in the pan. After opening, it was suppressed by the financial turmoil at the end of the month, and selling became prevalent. However, after falling below 1.97 million, it once appeared stable. The central government allocated 225 units, priced at 1.975 million. There was no special change after 10 o'clock. However, the money supply was extremely tight, and the underground interest rate was said to be as high as 2.5 to 3 jiao. For a time, killing and recovery occurred. At noon, it fell to below 1.92 million. In the afternoon, the storm gradually subsided, and there was a slight turnaround, rising back to 1.95 million. As a result, it fell by 30,000 compared to before closing. The price of decorated gold was 10,600 per 10,000, and the price of fine silver was 2,000 yuan. Due to the chaotic money supply, the underground interest rate was generally between 1.8 and 2.2 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange: The US dollar trembled from the panic of banks lacking funds on the evening of the end of the month, selling at the lowest price of around 1,900 yuan. It was unable to recover. From opening at around 2,640 yuan in the morning, it gradually weakened to 2,480 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it rose slightly with the gold market to hover around 2,550 yuan. As a result, it fell sharply by 100 yuan compared to the end of last month. Hong Kong dollars were oversupplied from 560 yuan, and as a result, it also fell by 40 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 550 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 680 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 8,900, all of which were extremely chaotic. The US exchange rate was nominally stable but actually sluggish.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Discussing Measures to Prevent the Abuse of Bad Checks</h3>
<p>Since the disastrous fall in the government bond market, most speculators have collapsed and have had to resort to fraudulent behavior by issuing bad checks. Recently, similar cases have been appearing frequently, causing great panic in the financial markets of Beijing and Shanghai. The Central Bank is making every effort to prevent this in order to stabilize the financial market. It is heard that it has been consulting with the responsible departments of the Ministry of Finance on concrete measures to restrict this practice. In the future, discounting bills will be handled according to the Negotiable Instruments Law to prevent bad checks from entering the market.</p>
<h3>Applications for Export Goods Styles are Subject to Extremely Strict Review</h3>
<p>The Bank of China, due to the decline in the verification industry after the war, has specially launched export goods loans, and especially encourages manufacturers holding import certificates from overseas countries by providing them with low-interest loans. It is heard that since the above news was revealed, many people have been actively applying. In order to ensure that the loans are used for legitimate purposes, the bank conducts a detailed review of the above loan applicants in advance, and conducts investigations at any time afterward.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds are Flat</h3>
<p>Government prices are extremely stable. There are still a few buyers who are curious to buy at low prices, and shorts are also covering, but transactions are still mostly scattered. Unified bonds (Type C) only fluctuated by 30 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, it showed a slight increase. Types A, B, D, and E also rebounded slightly.</p>
<h3>Ripple Effect of Late Month's End; Bulls Dump Holdings; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Plummet</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were forced to cut long positions due to the urgent financial turmoil. Except for Mei Ya, which managed to stabilize after falling too severely to a low of 2,400 yuan, all other stocks closed at lower prices. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down. Only Sino-French maintained, and the decline was limited. After weakening at noon, the market stabilized. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the five popular stocks such as Yongsha fell by about 20%, while the unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Sino-French, which fell slightly, fell by about 10%. Veteran stocks were also dragged down slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were also caught in the whirlpool. All stocks were surrounded by cuts. Ewo Silk fell sharply by 1,100 yuan as soon as the market opened, falling to 8,600 yuan. After the opening, it continued to show weakness. However, more stocks maintained lower prices. The market closed at noon. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Ewo Silk and Paper fell by 15%, while British Associated Industries, Kwang Ewo Brewery fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson fell by slightly less than 10%, and the decline of Asian Steel was limited.</p>
<h3>191 Material Importers Licensed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Imports Management Office, since accepting applications for registration from licensed material importers for five types of materials, a total of 191 importers have been approved for registration. Among them, there are 28 motion picture importers, 27 coal oil importers, 73 automobile importers, 11 sugar importers, and 52 tobacco importers.</p>
<h3>Price of Quanzhou Dried Longans Rises</h3>
<p>It is heard that the new sprouts of Quanzhou longans are very scarce this year, and the output of this season is expected to be poor. Therefore, the price of old stock has risen instead. Recently, it has risen by 230,000 yuan, causing the opening price in Shanghai to tighten accordingly.</p>
<h3>Bank Profits are High for the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Financial news: The settlements of Shanghai banks for the first half of this year have been completed. Commercial banks have all made profits. The highest profit amount has reached more than 500 million yuan, and the lowest is also around 50 million yuan. The reason why each bank has made a profit is mostly due to speculation, so it cannot determine the future of the Shanghai financial market.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Tightens, Gold Prices Rebound Slightly, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downstream. The money supply in the financial community tightened, and gold prices fell back into the 2 million range. Yarn prices also plummeted as a result. As soon as the market opened in the morning, there were many sellers and few buyers. Dealers were eager to sell, and prices gradually fell. Double Horse and 42-count double-ply yarn fell the most, about 100,000 yuan lower than before the end of last month. The remaining 20-count small and medium-sized yarns fell by about 340,000 yuan. At noon, Fang Jian opened yarn as usual, and the price also depreciated with the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton telegraph fell by 31 to 44 pounds. The near-term US cotton price was $31.07, the construction period price was $31.26, and the current spot price of Mitling was $31.76. Current cotton transactions in this port were flat. Because the prices of US cotton and yarn both fell, manufacturers and cotton prices were hesitant to wait and see. Only Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory entered Pengjiapo for 400 bales, priced at 95,000 to 98,000. In addition, other factories have not made purchases.</p>
<p>Due to the tight money supply and rumors that several banks were stranded, the cloth market was greatly disheartened. Many buyers were eager to sell, and at the same time, the road water overflowed. There were few people gathering in the market, and transactions were very light. The leading Longtou thread was exhausted at 250 yuan, but the general grabbing threads were sold and settled, falling by 750 yuan, and then stabilized in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Grain Price Review Committee to be Formally Established This Week; Responsible for Assessing Rice Prices in the City</h3>

It is understood that the organizational regulations of the association will be drafted within one or two days at the latest, and the association is also expected to be formally established within this week. After the association is established, it will refer to the rice prices in various production areas and the various expenses that grain merchants should pay when purchasing grain in Shanghai, plus the legal profits of grain merchants, and then assess a fair price to encourage rice merchants to automatically purchase rice and grain in various production areas and come to Shanghai, and at the same time eliminate the black market rice prices in the city.</p>
<h3>North and South Rice Markets Open; Few Transactions in the Markets</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The north and south rice markets officially started business at 9 o'clock yesterday. The south market is located on the third floor of 377 Minguo Road, and the main persons in charge are Qiu Fuxiang and Zhu Yongming. The north market is located at 212 Kulun Road, and the main persons in charge are Huang Jinxian and Gu Yisheng. Although the two markets officially started business today, there were not many rice merchants in the market, and transactions were scattered. A total of 303 rice numbers applied for allocation (those who had previously applied but had not yet received allocation). A total of 28 were allocated yesterday, and a large number are expected to be allocated today. It is heard that after the business is established, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the focus will be on the south market, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the focus will be on the north market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were very few rice market transactions, and the digestion of flour turned lax, returning to small three to four hundred yuan. There were few removals of wheat from other places, and there were no formal transactions. Bean cakes were firm in the morning and flat at noon. The yellow bean market was like a shadow, broad beans also had little honor or disgrace, tea beans were priced high and the secondary grade was sluggish, corn was sluggish, bean hemp was high and stable, the secondary grade was cut, cowpeas were flat, and red beans were scarce and firm. The oil market was flooded with incoming goods, digestion was weak, and prices fell by two to three thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Sellers Raise Prices</h3>
<p>China's tea exports are still trapped in a state of silence. Wu Chang, Xinhua, Zhuyutai and other tea shops in this city continued to negotiate with the goods side for Wuyuan Chen Te Gong (a type of tea). Holders unanimously pushed up sales, resulting in a firm market. The market started stable, but soon rose all the way. As a result, each tan (a unit of weight) went straight from 40,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan. The closing market was still firm. As for domestic sales of colored tea, due to the two-day holiday, although it rained after the market opened, the buying interest in the shops and villages of Suxi was still strong. Sellers insisted, so transactions were not abundant and the market remained stable as before.</p>
<h3>Silver Not Worth Worshiping; US Senator Opposes Raising Prices</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 3rd] New York State Congressman Schley, in response to a silver advertisement recently published by the Colorado Mining Association, wrote to the New York Times, stating: There is no reason for the current "silver party" to request that the silver price be raised from 71.11 to 90.5 cents, and then to 1.29 yuan in two years. The current price of silver is already too high, and silver is no longer used as a reserve for currency. Furthermore, silver is originally a by-product of copper and lead, so the silver bill is only a supplementary clause for these metals. Schley also stated that one day, silver will no longer be regarded as a sacred object and worshiped. The true value of silver is far lower than the government's price, so continuing this exaggerated promotion of silver benefits is absurd.</p>

<h3>General Bi Leder Sick in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Translated Manuscript of this Newspaper's Translation Office</p>
<p>If one day China's civil war stops and embarks on the path of peaceful and prosperous national construction, then much of the credit should be given to this thirty-two-year-old young Brigadier General, Bi Leder, who is now suffering from typhoid fever and lying ill in the Beiping Naval Hospital.</p>
<p>Hard Work, Wading Through Water</p>
<p>Since arriving in Chongqing in December last year as a military attache at the American Embassy, ​​he has worked tirelessly day and night. He took off his clothes and waded through the icy cold [river name], to inspect rural conflicts. He drove a jeep for hundreds of miles on the most rugged roads in the world. He flew from one corner of China to the other, mediating disputes between the conflicting Kuomintang and Communist generals. He argued, pleaded, persuaded, and got angry. He made sure that both sides gradually reached an agreement.</p>
<p>Red-Faced, Returning to Good Terms</p>
<p>Once, in Shenyang, Communist General Rao Shushi and Government Army Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang quarreled red-faced over an issue. This "Young Brigadier General" quickly came out to mediate, inviting them both to the bathroom. The three of them played with a small toy boat in the bathtub until they were very happy and returned to good terms.</p>
<p>Full of Enthusiasm, Building Airports</p>
<p>Brigadier General Bi Leder turned thirty-three on July 24 of this year. He is from Indiana. After graduating from the military academy in 1937, he obtained a Master of Engineering degree from Cornell University in 1940. Soon after, he was assigned to the China-India-Burma theater to build air force bases. He built B29 Superfortress airports in western China. His only tools were a pencil mark on the map, an extraordinary amount of energy, and a few local words he had learned. In this way, he built the airports.</p>
<p>Following Marshal, Participating in Negotiations</p>
<p>In 1944, he returned to Washington, and then returned to China with Marshal Marshall. He participated in many of the most complex and difficult negotiations, reaching the January 10th ceasefire agreement. A few days later, he became the director of the Military Mediation Execution Department. The political atmosphere in Chongqing soon deteriorated, and China seemed to be on the verge of division again. Brigadier General Bi Leder did everything possible to unite this divided country.</p>
<p>Working Sixteen Hours a Day</p>
<p>He flew to remote rural areas, landing laboriously on makeshift airports where even birds had to be careful when landing, trying to get the conflicting Kuomintang and Communist generals to reconcile. He drove a jeep on rough roads, trying to find the right people to negotiate. In Beiping, he worked sixteen hours a day, trying to get both sides of the conflict to implement the ceasefire agreement. He also often flew to Nanjing to consult with Marshal Marshall, bringing a fresh breath to this busy headquarters.</p>
<p>Traveling in Central Plains, Suffering Greatly</p>
<p>One of the most arduous trips made by Brigadier General Bi Leder was when he flew to Hankou with Generals Xu Yongchang and Zhou Enlai to inspect the Communist Party's accusations of the Kuomintang army's encirclement and annihilation of thousands of Communist troops in the Central Plains. From Hankou to the investigation site was eighty miles - a three-day walk. The road was terrible. Torrential rain washed away all the bridges. The river rose very high. Bi Leder directed the temporarily hired workers to use bamboo poles to carry the jeep and wade across the river, with the water reaching everyone's necks - including Bi Leder, of course. After the matter was over, he returned to Nanjing and flew a small transport plane himself. He had a big crash when landing, which made the people at the airport sweat a lot. The plane jumped forty feet high, but Bi Leder got out of the plane with a smile on his face, holding the signed agreement in his hand, and then went to participate in a series of difficult meetings, running back and forth between Marshal Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Chiang. Bi Leder was thinner and more haggard, but he still worked with his usual energy.</p>
<p>Flying to Changchun, Mediating the War</p>
<p>He flew to Changchun to serve as the leader of the advance team of the Military Mediation Execution Department, preparing to mediate the war in the Northeast. He stayed for a long time, then returned to Beiping to have a tooth pulled. By then, he was already very tired from overwork. The doctor advised him to rest in the hospital for a longer period of time, but he refused. He took new instructions and new hopes and returned to Changchun.</p>
<p>In Changchun, Bi Leder suddenly developed a high fever and returned to Beiping. It is said that he is suffering from typhoid fever, but it has not been completely determined. But one thing is clear to everyone: he damaged his own health in order to seek peace within China. (Associated Press, June 30)</p>

<p>Illegal Occupation of Rented House</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I was a tenant at 182 Kulun Road before the war. During the enemy occupation, the house was seized by the Japanese, and after the victory, it was illegally occupied by military personnel. The property was returned to the owner, Yeguang Company, by the Central Trust Bureau for civilian residence. Because I was a long-term tenant before the war, I had priority and rented 182 Kulun Road. Now, it is forcibly occupied by the barber shop of the Welfare Society of the Ministry of Military Administration. However, the barber shop is not operated by the military but is a collusion between a civilian, Qiu Zhifu, and a Mr. Guo of the Welfare Society, using the name as a pretense. I have petitioned the Housing Allocation Committee of the Shanghai Administrative Yuan three times, and the committee has sent personnel to investigate five times, but to this day, there has been no approval. I pay the rent, water, electricity, and gas bills every month. I ask you, is it that those who do not pay rent can live there, while those who do pay cannot? Is this reasonable? I request the Housing Allocation Committee to uphold justice immediately and return the house to the civilian resident. Xi Qi. 29th.</p>
<p>Students Not Receiving Milk Powder</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: We are students at the private Jingrui Primary School affiliated Civil School, located at the Dananmen in the Nanshi district. We heard that civil school students were also receiving milk powder rations. We happily took our containers to receive them. Who knew that during class, the teacher lectured us, "You are so old, what are you eating milk powder for?!" The students looked at each other, not daring to say much. We think there are many students in the civil school, and each person receiving two pounds is a considerable amount. Nominally, we are receiving it, but in reality, it is all taken by the school. Naturally, we are resentful. We request the Education Bureau and the Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to investigate the swallowed milk powder and use it to aid the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Students Zhang Ziqiang, Wang Wenzhao, et al., respectfully submit.</p>
<h3>Review and Outlook on Public Utilities in Shanghai — Zhao Zengjue</h3>
<p>When we talk about the operation and management of public utilities, we must first have an understanding of the nature, responsibilities, and rights of public utilities. A brief explanation is given below:</p>
<p>(1) Nature of Public Utilities</p>
<p>(A) The products of public utilities are either a certain service (such as telephone and trams) or a certain material (such as gas) or a mixture of materials and services (such as electricity and water supply).</p>
<p>(B) Public utilities are local in nature, exclusively for local use, especially for areas closely connected with their supply and distribution.</p>
<p>(C) The products of public utilities, whether services or materials, are standardized, meaning that what is supplied to this place cannot be inferior to what is supplied to that place.</p>
<p>(D) Public utilities are cash transaction companies; users must pay their bills promptly, otherwise, there is a real possibility of business interruption.</p>
<p>(2) Responsibilities of Public Utilities</p>
<p>(A) Public utilities must provide universal supply within their area, meaning that anyone willing to pay a reasonable price and apply for service should be supplied.</p>
<p>(B) Public utilities must provide adequate service, meaning that supply should reach the maximum capacity of their equipment.</p>
<p>(C) Public utilities must provide equal service and should not make unfair or unreasonable distinctions.</p>
<p>(D) Public utilities must set prices that are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>(E) The establishment or expansion of public utilities must be approved by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(F) Public utilities must not attach other unreasonable conditions to their services.</p>
<p>(G) Public utilities must ensure the safety of users and the public in their services.</p>
<p>(H) Public utilities should not suddenly stop service without notice.</p>
<p>(3) Rights of Public Utilities</p>
<p>(A) Public utilities are entitled to greater rights than ordinary enterprises, such as the possession of exclusive operating areas and the requisition of land.</p>
<p>(B) Users of public utilities are legally required to pay fees and are responsible for protecting company property.</p>
<p>(C) Public utility companies have the right to demand protection from competition from other parties.</p>
<p>(D) Public utility companies shall not be acquired by other parties without proper legal procedures, and if acquired, they shall be entitled to reasonable compensation.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen's Message to Officers and Soldiers Nationwide (Continued from the First Page of the Previous Day)</h3>
<p>Second, regarding the significant achievements from last year to the present, they can be roughly divided into the reorganization of the army, the repatriation of enemy prisoners, the collection and disposal of enemy and puppet military supplies, and the demobilization of the Youth Army. A brief description of each is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganization of the Army: The National Army originally had 89 infantry corps, 239 divisions (including three corps and eight divisions of the Youth Army, excluding the 25th Division, 120th Division, and 39th Division of the Communist Army), and two cavalry corps, 13 divisions. From March of this year to February of next year, they are to be reorganized into 30 infantry corps (totaling 90 divisions) and 10 cavalry brigades. The surplus officers and soldiers will be discharged or transferred to other jobs. The reorganization and demobilization work of the above units will be implemented in two steps.</p>
<p>The first step is to reduce each corps by one-third, that is, a corps originally with three divisions and nine regiments will be reduced to a division with three brigades, and a corps originally with two divisions and six regiments will be reduced to a division with two brigades and four regiments. Each independent division will be reorganized into an independent brigade with two regiments. The second step will be implemented according to the basic plan signed by the military three-person team. However, after the 90 divisions are formed according to the prescribed organization, they should be gradually organized into 30 corps, each corps having two divisions, and gradually placed in the positions specified in the basic plan. The reorganization work of the above-mentioned first step will be implemented in three phases. The first phase of reorganization involves 27 corps and 66 divisions along the Longhai Railway and in the Northwest (excluding Xinjiang and Hexi), starting in March and completed by the end of April; the second phase of reorganization involves 32 corps and 92 divisions in the Yangtze River basin and south of the Yangtze River, starting on May 1 and completed by the end of June; the third phase starts on July 1, and the plan has already been drafted. Once the reorganization of the first step mentioned above is completed, the reorganization of the second step will continue to be implemented. The method is as follows: each infantry division will be reorganized into 90 infantry divisions according to the official organization, each division with two brigades and four regiments, totaling 14,000 people, and each corps headquarters will have approximately 6,300 directly subordinate troops. The starting date of the reorganization of each corps and division shall be determined by the Executive Headquarters for Mediation, and the organizational structure of the corps and divisions shall be determined separately. Each division originally with a three-brigade and six-regiment system will be adjusted to a division with a two-brigade and four-regiment system. In North China, a total of seven corps must be formed into one corps according to the prescribed organization before September 1 of this year, so that it can be combined with the Communist Army into a group army in the seventh month (i.e., September of this year). The other six corps can be formed separately later, and two or three corps will be designated to be combined with the Communist Army into a group army. However, there are still two points that need to be added: (1) In the first and second phases of the reorganization, all corps were reduced to divisions, and divisions were reduced to brigades. In the future, all original directly subordinate troops, except for a few cancellations, will be retained. For example, if each division has already canceled one regiment and transport company, then three new reconnaissance platoons will be established at the same time. (2) Although the reorganization plan for the third phase has been drafted, the Communist Army did not comply with the ceasefire agreement and launched offensives everywhere, causing domestic chaos, making it impossible to implement in reality.</p>
<p>(2) Repatriation of Enemy Prisoners: A total of more than 2 million Japanese prisoners and expatriates within China (excluding the Northeast) including northern Vietnam, were decided to be repatriated to their home country, in the plan decided at the Sino-American Joint Conference held in Shanghai on October 25 of last year, and a number of Japanese ships were used for transportation starting from November 15. The ports decided to be used were Tanggu, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Xiamen, Haiphong, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other eleven locations. The Inland Japanese Prisoner and Expatriate Removal Headquarters transported them to various ports. As for the establishment of transportation headquarters at each port, they were responsible for handling the inspection of Japanese prisoners and expatriates when they boarded the ships. Japanese prisoners and expatriates repatriated to their home country were allowed to carry 1,000 Japanese yen for civilians, 500 Japanese yen for officers, and 200 Japanese yen for soldiers, as well as their clothes and personal belongings. If they exceeded the regulations or had prohibited items, they would be confiscated and kept by the Chinese government as part of the future war reparations. All Japanese prisoners and expatriates in various regions were required to be completely repatriated by July 15. As of the end of June, a total of more than 1.95 million people had been repatriated to their home country.</p>
<p>(3) The plan for the collection and disposal of enemy and puppet military supplies divides the country into ten collection areas (Beijing-Shanghai, Wuhan, Beijing-Tianjin, Jiaoji, Vietnam, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Northeast). A special commissioner was dispatched to each area to handle the matter. Each area had gradually completed the receiving by the end of March of this year, and three additional verification committees were dispatched to verify the receiving by area, which is still in progress. As for the utilization of enemy and puppet military supplies, a plan was devised early and is being implemented step by step. All supplies of a supply nature, such as grain, ammunition, and fuel, will be supplied nearby in accordance with regulations. All supplies of a replenishment nature, such as weapons, clothing, and various equipment, will be allocated to the troops according to their needs. All supplies of an enrichment allocation nature, such as tanks, automobiles, and horses, will be used to enrich the troops separately. All raw materials from military factories will be used to start production in factories early and gradually, and raw materials will be allocated and utilized in a unified manner. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Third, after the war, our government has a lot of work to do, and it seems that it is not necessary for the government to hastily take back the investments of foreigners in the public utilities of this city. We must know that if we have such a huge sum of money, it can be used for other more important constructions, or for municipal constructions that we have not yet undertaken. Moreover, once the atmosphere of takeover is promoted, it will inevitably have a great reaction on foreign investment in China, which I think should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I believe that foreign companies with achievements should be maintained, that is, given reasonable profits: however, they should be appropriately coordinated with Chinese companies, so that they can cooperate with each other, and it is best to implement mergers, so that one industry is operated by one company. All Shanghai citizens have the same right to enjoy the same rights and obligations, and at the same time, they can use the trained management and technical personnel of each company to prepare for the construction of state-owned public utilities.</p>
<p>The following is a report on the improvement situation from January to June of the 35th year and the future plan. At the same time, because Shanghai is in short supply of water, electricity, gas, and transportation, it is necessary to treat both the symptoms and the root causes.</p>
<h3>Water Supply</h3>
<p>Drinking water is the foundation of public health for citizens. In January of this year, the Bureau invited representatives from the Health Bureau and various water plants to discuss and determine drinking water standards. The main points are that the number of coliform bacteria in one liter of water sample should not exceed ten, and the total hardness should not exceed 300. This regulation is now being implemented. According to the statistics in April, the total water production for the whole month was 11.74 million cubic meters (equivalent to 268.28 million gallons), and the sales volume was 7.15 million cubic meters (equivalent to 157.3 million gallons). Based on the city's population of 3.5 million, the average daily water consumption per person is approximately 15 gallons. Compared to the average daily water consumption of 8.2 gallons per person in the city in December, there has been significant progress, because the water consumption in June needs to be increased due to the hot weather, so April is used as a representative. If the equipment can be improved to fully utilize the water production, the average daily water consumption per person can be increased to more than 20 gallons.</p>
<p>However, the installation of tap water is not universal in the western part of Shanghai. Now is the summer season, and drinking water hygiene is even more important. The Bureau has long been preparing to restore the water supply stations before the war to solve this problem, but the sorting out and replenishment of water pipes, as well as the installation of water meters, require a large amount of money and take a considerable amount of time, which cannot meet the current urgent needs. Therefore, we are drawing up retail methods for tap water to be regularly sold to citizens in the area. In order to make it more universal, public faucets will be opened for a certain period of time every day in various civilian areas to provide free relief.</p>
<p>As for the fundamental plan, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>There are currently five tap water companies in Shanghai. The trunk and branch pipelines of each company almost cover the entire bustling urban area, but the western part of Shanghai is exclusively absent. In the former extra-settlement road area, although the British tap water company used to take over the supply, the area is too far from the British water plant (about 15 kilometers) and the pipe diameter is too small (2 inches to 6 inches), resulting in a pressure as low as 15 feet (the standard pressure should be between 30 feet and 50 feet), which cannot be fully supplied. Before the war, in order to thoroughly solve the water supply problem in western Shanghai, the municipal government advocated the establishment of a Shanghai West Tap Water Company in the form of Sino-foreign joint venture, and established a new water plant south of Longhua and upstream of the Huangpu River to seek a comprehensive solution. At that time, there was considerable progress in the discussion, but it was shelved due to the outbreak of the August 13 Incident. The Bureau is currently negotiating and proceeding to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai West Tap Water Company, the entire Shanghai tap water supply network (Water Supply Grid) can be roughly completed. Ways will be found to connect the water pipes between the exclusive operating areas of each company, so that they can be connected to each other. In case of emergency needs, they can supply each other. In this way, although there are six companies in Shanghai, it is actually no different from one organization. The city's sound water supply network will be completed by this time.</p>
<p>As for the distribution of water plants and the division of exclusive operating areas of the existing companies, there will inevitably be various unreasonable places. The utilization of each other's mechanical power pipelines is very uneconomical, but these things are all bound by exclusive contracts, and reasonable adjustments must be made gradually according to the circumstances. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>People of Yangzhou Never Forget General Fei: Invite Dong Mingde to Toast the Victory; Hope Air Force Colleagues Inquire About the Current Situation of Dong Jun to Comfort the Public's Expectations</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Please forgive me for not being polite. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the air force stationed in our Yangzhou, probably the Fifth Squadron, had an anti-Japanese hero, Mr. Dong Mingde, the captain. The impression he gave to the people of Yangzhou was too profound! Because once, three enemy planes came to bomb our Yangzhou airfield. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were all swept down and shot down by this anti-Japanese hero, Captain Dong. This victory not only dealt a fatal blow to the enemy, but also boosted the people's confidence in winning the war. Although Yangzhou was the air force base near the Shanghai and Nanjing area, the enemy planes were timid because of Captain Dong's bravery, and dared not invade again. Yangzhou no longer suffered the pain of air raids. In all fairness, it was entirely due to Captain Dong's bravery. Later, when Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the air force in Yangzhou also withdrew. Later, in the newspaper, I saw that Captain Dong chased the enemy planes over Jiangyin, and single-handedly broke into the enemy's formation, and was shot down again. After the National Army continued to withdraw westward, Captain Dong's fame gradually alienated from the people of Yangzhou. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the sun and the moon have been shining again, during these eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I dare say that no Yangzhou person does not miss this hero's safety and health; no Yangzhou person does not hope that this hero can come to Yangzhou; accept our cheers and salute. At the very least, we have to come and toast a glass of victory wine. But we do not know the whereabouts of this hero now, so we are writing to your newspaper, asking you to publish it, and to find a way to inquire about the whereabouts of the hero from the air force authorities. I think your newspaper will not disappoint the 100,000 people of Yangzhou for this little bit of foolishness. To show our seriousness, we are sending it by registered mail. I humbly request your safety, Liu Zhonghe.</p>
<p>[Editor's note] This search for a person's manuscript is sincere, earnest, enthusiastic, and deeply moving! We will be happy to publish it. Dong Jun's loyalty, bravery, and anti-Japanese war have contributed to the party and the country, which is admirable! What is the current situation? Please tell us as soon as possible. If Dong Jun is not in this port, please ask the air force colleagues to inform us of his whereabouts, and this column will forward it on his behalf.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Record of Situ Qiao's War Disaster Painting Exhibition — Zhao Jingshen</h3>
<p>The sky was covered with dark clouds, and I hurried out of my house, took the tram to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, and went to see Situ Qiao's war disaster painting exhibition in the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. Fortunately, when I arrived on the third floor, it was pouring rain outside. Watching Situ Qiao's paintings on such a gloomy and rainy day - a tour of this hell on earth.</p>
<p>I was very happy to meet Mr. Situ Qiao, with a long beard and protruding eyes, quite like a foreign missionary. Indeed, he should be a pastor. He has the compassionate heart of Feng Zikai, who also has a long beard. Later, he introduced his wife Yi Mei to me, and I read many of her excellent poems on the paintings. They are truly an ideal couple, like Zhao Mingcheng and Li Qingzhao in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Although there are only eighty paintings, the legs became weak after seeing it once because the content was substantial. I have admired Situ Qiao's paintings for a long time. More than ten years ago, many of the literary and artistic paintings of the Beixin Bookstore were painted by him and Tao Yuanqing for the cover. This exhibition made me even more delighted with his superb artistic skills and his thorough and accurate understanding of life. I heard that the exhibition will be open until the 7th.</p>
<p>This exhibition gave me an inspiration: war is indeed too terrible. Looking at the terrible scene of the whole family starving to death in the "Ghost Shadow in Empty Room" picture, everyone will be shocked. My heart was suddenly lifted up, the mother was as thin as a skeleton, and the child who died from eating grass roots and tree bark with a distended belly, no wonder the author had to paint with tears. His paintings, such as the famine victims in Quanzhou, the rogues, the famine refugees, the waiting to be fed, the starved corpses, the sun-baked pictures, the cart, the gnawing of wild grass, etc., all illustrate the famine of the people. The war caused people to be separated from their wives and children, and the war caused people to starve to death. On the other hand, there are people enjoying themselves in high-rise buildings, so the starving corpses are entitled with Du Shaoling's poem: "The rich man's gate smells of wine and meat, and the road has frozen bones." Yi Mei entitled the boat girl: "The eyes shake the moon, the rain shakes the wind, the painting shakes everything, the night shakes the dream, it can't shake off the cold, it can't shake off poverty, the price of rice is bitterly high and the donation is heavy!"</p>
<p>Another terrible side of war is the destruction of engineering and industry. For example, the ruins of the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou, Henan, the Lukou Iron Bridge, the ruins of the Guilin Textile Factory, the ruins of the Nanxuan Library, and the Liuzhou Railway Station. There is also a steaming room that has become a rubble, writing about the Liuzhou Alcohol Factory, and Rong Bridge writing that when the enemy attacked, we had to blow up the iron bridge, but our army who was crossing the bridge failed to withdraw, and with a bang, they were all torn to pieces. On the one hand, we also see reconstruction, rebuilding our homes, bombing and reconstruction, and Wuzhou, which is being rebuilt. Yes, the word "reconstruction" is repeatedly seen in the painting title, which shows how eagerly the author hopes that a new China can be built. After the Anti-Japanese War, it should be the construction of the country. After suffering foreign insults, the people can no longer withstand the civil war! I hope that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can work together to build a new China.</p>
<p>Looking at the pictures of the national martyrs, Hao Menglin, Zhang Zizhong, Xie Jinyuan, Dai Haiwen, Zhao Tong, and other generals and righteous men are all showing us that we must properly reorganize this broken country. They stared with white eyes and hoped that we would not fail them, these victims. I believe that their blood is still boiling underground.</p>
<p>Please look at "Turning Spears into Plowshares." This is what we need now. The fields will be deserted, the industrial zone will become ruins, won't you be able to breathe before another war? If we fight again, the tragedy will be even worse than this, I can't bear to imagine it.</p>
<p>Mo Ruo and Nai Chao came to see the paintings with Shao Qiongdu, the sky was already clear, and the sun shone on the studio. I wish and hope that this is a sign of light!</p>
<h3>Short Notes</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Because of the family’s urging, you had to leave in a hurry. When I saw you off that day, it was a gloomy morning; only the two of us were by the riverbank. We walked slowly. At first, we were as silent as the fog on the river. For a long time, we lowered our heads, not saying a word to each other. Later, unable to bear the oppressive silence, I finally asked you, "Do you love Bin?"</p>
<p>You looked at me for a long time before saying with what seemed like great determination:</p>
<p>"In the past half year, besides you and Bin, who can understand me, no one else in the crowd can understand me or help me." Then you lowered your head and said, "He is so sincere, passionate, and helpful... I love him."</p>
<p>I believe you, because you are a naive and pure girl. But when you were about to leave, Bin was lying down, his eyes wide open and staring blankly at the ceiling. I asked him to get up and see you off, but he claimed to be sick. I asked several times, but he refused. Because of his distressed appearance, I was worried and also suspected the shadows hidden between you. So when I saw you off alone, after simply asking you that one question, I didn't say anything else. Only you can hide the deception behind it, and I can't dispel that hidden worry; my heart felt like a heavy lead weight, sinking down. I came back after seeing you off, and Bin didn't say anything to me either. I held onto it, waiting for an unpredictable mystery to be revealed one day automatically.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday, a week after you left. Because I had lost your laughter and singing for so long, the dormitory was even more silent. Only Bin and I sat in silence in the room, listening to the sound of rain and wind outside the window, with no mood to talk at all. I was okay, just a little lonely in my heart, but Bin's heart was hard to describe. The green trees outside, which used to be where we talked and made funny faces, now seemed like a primitive forest, lurking with mystery and hiding terror.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he just lay in bed all day, stiffly, his eyes habitually blank, staring at the gloomy sky outside the window, like a net of iron. He seemed to anticipate some terrible change coming, not speaking, not smiling. I wanted to find something to say to comfort him, but what words could have such miraculous effect? He had first closed the "door of negotiation" on himself tightly, making me lack the courage to open my mouth, and even if I had thousands of words of sympathy and comfort, there was no way to say them. A long, silent afternoon passed like that, the two of us silently facing each other; my eyes staring blankly at him, his eyes staring blankly at the square of sky outside the window. Night came, and after the darkness had occupied our room for a long time, I finally turned on the light. The pale light shone on us, and I almost couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>"Bin! Are you worried?"</p>
<p>"She still said she loved you when she left."</p>
<p>"What? Is he really sick?"</p>
<p>I didn't look at him, just pressed on with my questions, but other than the sound of turning on the bed, no one answered me. I was ruled by the night.</p>
<p>Early this morning, Zhi Deng floated in, carrying two wedding invitations. I was surprised and delighted to tear open the bright red envelopes and pull out the beautiful pink paper folded inside. Oh! I couldn't believe it. The names printed on it were yours, and next to your name was Ming, whom you often called "Big Brother." Isn't this a huge, merciless mockery of honesty? Has the unpredictable mystery been revealed?</p>
<p>Bin grabbed the red invitation, as if he had fallen into an abyss of despair. What was he thinking? Was he regretting? Or hating? Who knows, who can say. Turgenev wrote in the last section of "A Nest of Gentlefolk," that Liza's eyelashes trembled almost imperceptibly, but I saw his eyelashes trembling, saw him struggling, groaning, his whole soul shaking, exploding, vanishing... In an instant, the covers of the two red invitations were torn to shreds with a whoosh. But the two pink papers were not torn, made a gesture of tearing, and then suddenly and unconsciously fell back into the bed.</p>
<p>I retreated to my bedside, sighing softly, "Once you enter the gates of a noble house, they are as deep as the sea, and from then on, Xiao Lang is a stranger." I never thought that a girl would deceive a loyal, honest, passionate, and loving person! I hate, hate that these two extremes, honesty and deception, are constantly mocking life!</p>
<p>Originally, I shouldn't say such things, but the facts are forcing me to say them. Please forgive me. You know, because both Bin and I are poor children, there is no way for us to send you a gift. At the same time, Bin asked me not to leave him and not to leave here, so I can't go to congratulate you on your grand ceremony.</p>
<p>You used to say that I was a timid and awkward child in front of girls. I admit your words, especially now, I am even more convinced of the correctness of this statement. Now, let this timid child offer you some shy greetings!</p>
<h3>Depression (5)</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Depression from the environment</p>
<p>For a long time, the environment has become a place of complaint. If anyone is unhappy, they complain about the environment; if they fail, or suffer losses, they complain about the environment; even if children are not progressing, if sons are thieves and daughters prostitutes, if morality is declining, all the evils that arise are blamed on the environment. If the environment were a living thing, it would be actively killed, or it would be suffocated to death under public censure. The environment has become a punching bag, a scapegoat. If the environment had consciousness, it would burst into tears!</p>
<p>But what exactly is the environment? The environment has no mouth, it cannot defend itself or explain itself. If the environment had a mouth, it would definitely say that all kinds of evils were not done by it, but by the people who scold it. It didn't exist in the first place, the people who scold it created it, and then did all kinds of evils and attributed them to it. If it were a living thing, it would definitely understand this reasoning, and it would definitely feel depressed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the environment is also like an organism, constantly moving forward and upward. A comparison of ancient and modern history will show this. However, some people are unwilling to let it move forward and upward, wanting it to fall behind and regress. For every step it takes forward, some people will even pull it back two steps. It struggles endlessly, always struggling to move forward and upward. It works so hard, yet it cannot be understood by people, and people simply complain about it, which makes it feel especially depressed.</p>
<p>People are unwilling to make it an environment that supports prosperous publishing, and publishers complain about it, which it really cannot understand. Why are there so many selfish and self-serving people, causing prices to rise, making people unable to make a living, so that publishing costs have reached unprecedented heights? It not only wants publishers to have publishing convenience, but also wants publishers to agree with the editors' opinions and publish good publications, which is also to say that it wants writers to write good things, so that readers can read good spiritual food. It has a belly full of compassion, but it is not understood by people, and what it gets is only complaints, so it cannot avoid depression!</p>
<p>It especially understands that education is the greatest tool for reducing or even eliminating selfish and self-serving people. And publishing occupies a very important position in the categories of education. It hopes that it can become a perfect environment, suitable for human survival, and starts with publishing, but now there are a few thoroughly selfish people who control everything, disrupt everything, and destroy everything, making it unable to be improved and unsuitable for human survival, and they still blame it. There is no greater injustice in the world than this! In addition to depression, it simply has no words to explain, and a hundred deaths would not atone!</p>
<p>However, from this, we can also understand that the environment is the linchpin of all current events. We must relieve the depression of the environment before we can talk about relieving all other depressions, and only when the depression of the environment is relieved will all other depressions be relieved along with it, and our most original readers will have proper spiritual food to enjoy.</p>
<p>To catch thieves, catch the king first. We must strive to relieve the depression of the environment, otherwise, bit by bit, we will never have a reasonable life, let alone proper spiritual food!</p>
<h3>Building a Dam</h3>

<h3>Reading Mr. Wang Jinshan's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>The development of Chinese painting in the Tang Dynasty underwent a fundamental change due to the influence of Indian culture. As a result, painters intentionally or unintentionally became preachers of Indian philosophy, and their ideology was more or less covered with a layer of metaphysics. In terms of subject matter, works based on stories and figures from Buddhist scriptures also began to occupy a significant proportion. In the past century, traditional Chinese culture, due to its own aging and poverty, urgently needs to gain new life and has absorbed Western culture. As a major sector of culture, painting is no exception. Generally, excellent painters have begun to flexibly apply Western techniques. Even the most typical Chinese paintings often implicitly contain the style of Matisse or the style of Picasso.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan has a high degree of cultivation in Chinese painting, and is especially able to critically accept the heritage of past generations. He also has a widespread and in-depth contact with general scholarship. These conditions have sublimated his painting to the realm of art.</p>
<p>Regarding the statues of Guanyin Bodhisattva and Arhats, Mr. Jinshan's brushwork is very skilled and powerful, making us feel as if these deities are not illusory, but are real existences that we often see and hear, and are just like us, one of the many beings in the vast world. In recent years, painters who have worked hard on Buddhism and Taoism, such as Zhang Daqian, Zhang Heng, and Lei Zhen, have mostly used the hard work of copying on the Dunhuang murals or Dazu stone carvings. Mr. Jinshan creates more based on subjective imagination, encompassing more freehand elements. They have all achieved brilliant achievements, truly the so-called "There is more than one road to Rome."</p>
<p>"Overlapping Mountains," "Gorge Stream and Sails," and "Mountain Stream and Small Bridge" are all landscapes of Sichuan. I spent a long time in Sichuan, and since coming east, I have always been thinking about that rich red basin. When I gaze at the clear river water on the painting, a mountain peak faintly visible in the misty white fog, it feels like a reunion with an old friend, with indescribable joy and indescribable intimacy.</p>
<p>I am a lover of painting, but I lack the ability to appreciate and understand. Occasionally, when I write some critical texts, I inevitably come close to scratching an itch from outside my boot. Mr. Jinshan has been a respected friend for many years and will surely not be surprised by my superficiality. Therefore, I have recorded the impressions and thoughts gained at the exhibition as above.</p>

<h3>Staying Together (74)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Out of sympathy, Lihua often went to visit Shi Yulou. Her impression of Shi Yulou in the past was vague and indifferent. Also, because their personalities were both taciturn, they rarely spoke at ordinary times, so a deep friendship never developed. However, compared to some people in her environment, Lihua still had some good feelings for Shi Yulou. Especially after Shi Yulou went crazy, she felt even more sorry for him, just like she felt sorry for herself.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou was actually sick! His mind was still not very clear. And he coughed very badly and kept spitting up blood. He had aged beyond recognition! The doctor said it was consumption and that he needed to eat more tonics and nourishing foods. But this was impossible. His finances could barely maintain his and Madam Weng's life, plus the expense of opium. He was already in debt. How could he still have the strength to treat his illness and nourish his body? For his sake, Madam Weng had recently taken on washing clothes for guests at the apartment. In addition, Madam Mo would help from time to time. (Madam Mo had never been bad to Madam Weng, and at the same time, she was repaying Shi Yulou for teaching Bawa how to act.) Shi Yulou was also very grateful to Madam Weng for her willingness to endure hardships for him, but sometimes he couldn't help but feel annoyed! He felt that if it weren't for Madam Weng's constraints, he could be more relaxed, at least he could run the docks again. It was always easier for him to get by alone, and with one more person, his actions were not free. Thinking of this, he regretted not bringing Madam Weng out of Jingzhou. He blamed himself for not knowing his own limitations, for not thinking that he would have such a down-and-out day.</p>
<p>If one day an actor who treats acting as his first life has his "play" finished, then everything is finished. Shi Yulou's madness arose from this! He was sad that he had been acting for nearly thirty years, and that once he accidentally messed up because of his poor health, the audience would ruthlessly overturn his entire brilliant history of the past thirty years! What a cruel blow! At the same time, how unconvinced it made him! He wanted to "make a comeback," but he calculated his age and realized that he was already forty years old. In any case, he could not outshine a young and beautiful person. So he was sad! He complained! He cursed!</p>
<p>One day, Lihua came to see Shi Yulou, bringing him a pack of "Da Qian Men" cigarettes (this was the gift she often gave Shi Yulou). Shi Yulou smoked, broke through his past silence, took Lihua's hand and said:</p>
<h3>Dull Thief</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>I happened to read Gu Tinglin's Rizhilu, in which he said: "The people of the Ming Dynasty, all their writings are nothing but theft... The people of today only have poor behavior and no talent, and cannot understand the meaning of the author. The books they steal will certainly not be as good as the original, what harm is there in calling them dull thieves?" The current Chinese publishing industry makes us feel the same as Mr. Tinglin, and we are even afraid that even such dull thieves cannot be had in abundance.</p>
<p>I would divide recent Chinese writings into three categories: The first category is plagiarism and copying. They copy a section from foreign sources here and a section there, "compiling" them into books, many of which are "dull thieves who do not understand the author's meaning." The books they create are often awkward and difficult to read to the end. The second category is to thoroughly read and digest the works of various authors and then elaborate on them. This is "narrating but not creating." It sounds logical and fascinating. The third category is truly mature works that can "establish a school of thought" of their own. This is the crystallization of the author's years of thought, experience, or experimental research. In the current Chinese publishing industry, many books of the first category can be seen, books of the second category are already rare, and books of the third category are simply non-existent.</p>
<p>These three categories of books can also represent three stages of academic development. From the perspective of individual progress, writing articles is mostly plagiarism at first, then narrating but not creating, and then moving further to be able to create. So I think there is nothing to fear about plagiarism, but there is fear about permanent plagiarism without progress. In terms of the progress of the entire culture, the initial stage is imitation, the second is digestion, and the final stage is creation. From the analysis of recent Chinese publications, it seems that China has not yet reached the stage of creation since contacting Western culture. We seem to be progressing too slowly. Can those engaged in academia not reflect deeply?</p>
<h3>Beethoven Biography</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhu Li, Romain Rolland, Translated by Fu Lei</p>
<p>Shanghai Camel Bookstore, First Edition, April of the Thirty-Fifth Year</p>
<p>Beethoven had a bold saying: "Joy bought with pain." (Letter to Mrs. Erdödy, October 10, 1815) This bold saying can explain his whole life: an unfortunate man, poor, crippled, lonely, a man made by pain, created joy to give to the world.</p>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770, in Bonn, near Cologne, in the attic of a dilapidated house. He was of Flemish descent; his father was an unintelligent and alcoholic tenor singer, and his mother was a maid. He was accompanied by misfortune, and life for him was a tragic and brutal struggle. Beethoven's childhood passed in misery: his mother died early, his father was an alcoholic, and at seventeen, he became the head of the family, bearing the responsibility for the education of two brothers. The Revolution broke out, flooding all of Europe and occupying Beethoven's heart. The University of Bonn was a center of new ideas, and on May 14, 1789, Beethoven enrolled. In November 1792, as the war spread to Bonn, Beethoven went to Vienna. His musical achievements gradually improved, and at the same time, his beliefs became firmer. He said, "My art should benefit the poor." Misfortune followed misfortune. Between 1796 and 1800, deafness began its torture. At first, Beethoven tried his best to endure it, but it was impossible. The chronic disease made him unable to hear the high notes of instruments and singing. This sorrow was expressed in his works, such as the "Pathétique Sonata" (1799), the Largo in the Sonata from Complete Works, Volume 10, No. 3, but not all of his works were melancholic, such as the joyful "Septet" (1800) and the crystal-clear "First Symphony" (1800). On top of these physical pains was added another kind of pain: he held a fierce passion, constantly falling in love, intoxicated and madly falling, dreaming of happiness, but later he was deceived by love and became a victim of love. In 1801, his passionate object was Giulietta Guicciardi, to whom he dedicated the famous "Moonlight Sonata" (1802). Giulietta married Count Gallenberg in November 1803, causing Beethoven's soul to be devastated, almost ending his life. Love, pain, decadence, and a proud will were all reflected in the great works of 1802: the Sonata with a Funeral March (Complete Works, Volume 26); the Fantasy Sonata, commonly known as the Moonlight Sonata, Sonata from Volume 31, No. 2; the Violin Sonata dedicated to Emperor Alexander; the Kreutzer Sonata; and the six tragic and painful religious songs in Volume 48. The "Second Symphony" of 1803, however, reflects his youthful love, clearly showing that his will dominated. The revolution moved Beethoven, and he dreamed of a heroic republic. He successively wrote the "Eroica Symphony"; "Bonaparte" (1804); the epic of the empire; and the finale of the "Fifth Symphony" (1805-08), a glorious narrative poem. In May 1806, Beethoven became engaged to Therese von Brunswick. The "Fourth Symphony" written in this year is a pure flower. Love abandoned him, and in 1810, he became lonely again. Love was gone; ambition was gone; all that remained was strength, and his behavior became even more outrageous. Goethe tried to get to know Beethoven and met him in 1812 at Teplitz, a spa in Bohemia, but they did not get along very well due to their different personalities. The "Seventh" and "Eighth Symphonies" were works of this period, written in Teplitz in 1812. 1814 was the peak of Beethoven's luck, and at the Congress of Vienna, he was seen as the glory of Europe. But what followed was the most tragic period: the proud and independent genius was unpopular, the promised subsidy was not paid in full, and his ears were completely deaf. In this abyss of bitterness, Beethoven sang the joy. This was his lifelong plan, which he had in mind since 1793 in Bonn. The theme of the Ode to Joy in the "Ninth Symphony" was written in 1822. But when writing the "Ninth Symphony," he had not yet made up his mind and still wanted to leave the Ode to Joy for the Tenth or Eleventh Symphony. Beethoven, in a state of depression, was thinking of leaving his homeland, but he stayed because of the success of the first performance of the "Ninth Symphony" (May 7, 1824). Material life was as difficult as ever, plagued by poverty and illness, and without reliance, but he overcame fate and pain. He shouted: "Sacrifice, always sacrifice all the ignorance of life for your art!" The new ending of the quartet in Complete Works 130, completed four months before his death, is very brisk. In November 1826, he caught a pleuritic cold, returning from running errands for his nephew's future, and fell ill in Vienna. On March 26, 1827, Beethoven took his last breath in a great storm, in a great snowstorm, in a clap of thunder.</p>
<p>This is Beethoven's life. In Romain Rolland's writing, he is a giant of passionate repression and courageous battle. In the original work, in addition to the biographical part, there are also "Beethoven's Will," "Collection of Letters," and "Thoughts."</p>
<p>The translator, Fu Lei, attached an article entitled "Beethoven's Works and His Spirit," which first praised the power of Beethoven's spirit. Secondly, it analyzes Beethoven's contribution to music: overturning the rigid rules of the sonata; although the harmony is very simple and classical, it has made great progress compared with the previous generation; and the reform of the use of musical instruments. Because of him, music changed from a dead academic subject to a living consciousness. Finally, it interprets Beethoven's important works, such as piano sonatas, violin and piano sonatas, quartets, ensemble pieces, symphonies, and religious music.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate literature or to understand the life of a great musician, this book is worth reading. Romain Rolland's lively and passionate writing and the translator's faithful and fluent translation need no introduction.</p>
<h3>Reading "Little Slope's Birthday"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jia'ai</p>
<p>"Little Slope's Birthday" is one of Lao She's early works. It is a lengthy fairy tale of nearly 60,000 words; it can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part describes fragments of the life of a child named Little Slope, and the second part narrates a tortuous and bizarre dream, which is the dream Little Slope had on his birthday night.</p>
<p>Little Slope is a Chinese boy growing up in Singapore. His father is a shop owner, and his mother is the most loving mother. His elder brother is called Big Slope, and his younger sister is called Fairy Slope. They have a very happy family. We know that every child in the world has his own world to live in, and Little Slope is of course no exception. He is so innocent and curious that he is always interested in the smallest things, constantly asking and thinking, and never willing to be still for a moment. Whether he is playing with his companions or alone, he has endless joy, often looking up and smiling at this "mysterious" world, even though he understands so little. Little Slope can't figure out these things: "Is Guangdong the same as India?"; "Is the color of snow red? Is it the small pieces of red paper that people scatter on the bride and groom when they come out?"; "When the train moves, do the streets, trees, people, horses, houses, and telephone poles run backwards?"; "Why do teachers love to teach so much? Don't they like to play?"; and "Why do teachers only want to ask what 7 times 7 is? Isn't '8' more pleasing to the eye than '7', and it can also be used as glasses when viewed horizontally?"... Little Slope can't understand these strange questions, but he can find ways to deal with his sister's various questions.</p>
<p>Little Slope has a most precious "secret": he hopes to become a "great" person in the future; an Indian gatekeeper, with a large white turban wrapped around his head, standing there imposingly, guarding the shop for his sister; or "when he grows up, he can become a Malay police officer, standing at the intersection, directing traffic; as long as his arm moves slightly, all the cars will move or stop according to his 'orders'. How powerful is that!" Little Slope is overjoyed. He really wants to grow up immediately and do what he likes to do; but he doesn't dare to tell his parents and teachers about this "ridiculous extravagance"; only when his father goes to the shop and his mother takes a nap, does he quietly mention it to Fairy Slope in the house. He also wraps a red silk scarf around his head or around his waist, enthusiastically performing, Fairy Slope doesn't understand these things, but always responds with a smile, she feels that her second brother is a truly remarkable hero.</p>
<p>At school, Little Slope likes to "fight injustice". He often uses his "head" to knock down "Baldy Zhang" who specializes in bullying girls. He talks about public morality and never deliberately damages the ducks and piglets hanging in other people's shops. When he sees an old woman on the road who can't carry her things, he rushes over to help and never asks for any reward, because he feels that he is a good boy.</p>
<p>Little Slope doesn't really like going to school and often escapes from the classroom to play when the teacher is dozing off, but when he is serious, he has a strong understanding and can understand many things.</p>
<p>One day, on Little Slope's birthday, his father was not as stern as usual and took him and his two brothers to the zoo to see the monkeys. In the afternoon, they went to the cinema to watch a movie. On this very happy day, he lay in bed and fell into a deep sleep. He dreamed that the wolf king turned into the male lead in the play to fight a group of monkeys, and that the monkey king was Baldy Zhang in disguise. The two sides fought really hard, with a variety of tricks, which was extremely interesting. After many twists and turns, Little Slope felt that his body was about to fall into the sea! He woke up so scared, and the story ended.</p>
<p>Overall, the author's focus is on the "strange dream" in the second half. He uses a rich imagination to make the plot bizarre and tense, which is very fascinating. However, I prefer the previous description of Little Slope's many anecdotes in school and at home. The child's psychology is portrayed so delicately that every action and every word is lively on the paper, as if you had seen these children somewhere before, but you had forgotten them, and now their shadows are being found here again. Can you deny the author's painstaking efforts in conception? Originally, there is no need for me to say much about a great writer like Lao She, who is known for depicting personality, but I still have to nag because of my heartfelt joy and admiration!</p>
<p>"Little Slope's Birthday" is the best reading material for children. It can promote their imagination and nourish the development of children's spirituality. I would like parents and teachers to introduce it to your children and students. At the same time, for those who aspire to write children's books, this book is an indispensable reference.</p>
<p>Writing this, I can't help but think of a trivial matter from ten years ago: at that time, I was studying in the second year of junior high school, and Mr. Gao, the teacher who taught us Chinese, once included "Little Slope's Birthday" as one of the extracurricular reading books. Because the school library did not have this book, I chose another book to read later! But this relaxing name has not been forgotten. Until today, ten years later, when it is my turn to stand on the podium and introduce this fairy tale to a group of children, I have an unspeakable feeling. Is it remembering the kind Mr. Gao? Or cherishing the past life? Childhood has dissipated like smoke, but when did it begin?... You can't help but be amazed at the ruthlessness of the passing years... Until one day, one day you deliberately browse through a fairy tale read by children, you will truly appreciate its preciousness, and you will sincerely thank the author—because only he has been caring about you, and only he has left the most beautiful and kind dreams for you, when you are no longer a child.</p>
<h3>The Four Cornerstones of Peace</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Author: Mrs. Dean</p>
<p>Recently Published by McGraw-Hill Book Company</p>
<p>It has not been a full year since the end of World War II: the post-war world is full of devastation, and there is no talk of recovery and prosperity; but the crisis of a new international war is brewing again. We certainly do not want to be alarmist and say that World War III is just around the corner; but it can be said that "the war is over, but peace has not yet arrived," and we still have to strive for it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean, the author, is a first-class American female writer who has a good understanding of international issues. In addition to serving as a researcher at the American Foreign Policy Association, she also teaches international issues at various universities in the United States. She is proficient in six languages and has traveled all over the world. She has visited the Soviet Union, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, France, and various Latin American countries to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the political situation in various countries, which is of great benefit to her research on international issues.</p>
<p>Whether in her thoughts or actions, she is a typical American pacifist; on the one hand, she loves peace and does not want the United States to participate in the war again: on the other hand, she opposes isolationism. She says: "We all know now that if other countries in the world are destroyed by war or civil strife and threatened by famine, poverty, and disease, then we cannot enjoy peace and prosperity at home."</p>
<p>Her views on international politics are very correct.</p>
<p>She believes that the most important task facing mankind is to "complete peace." However, the demands of the people of all countries are, on the one hand, personal security, free from the threat of unemployment, and on the other hand, national security, free from foreign aggression. Therefore, in order to ensure their own security, all countries must strive for "safe zones," which instead cause international disturbances and unrest. Today's international crisis is latent in the struggle of all countries to strive for safe zones. But how can we eliminate today's international crisis? She proposes a concrete method, which is to take collective action, that is, to support the United Nations organization to maintain world peace. As for how international organizations can be effective? First, when international conflicts occur that are sufficient to cause war, the countries should immediately consult with each other to seek peaceful solutions. Second, international organizations must have troops that can stop aggression at any time.</p>
<p>Based on this belief, she studied international security and world peace; at the same time, based on this belief, she wrote this book "The Four Cornerstones of Peace" (The Four Cornerstones of Peace), which is divided into seven chapters:</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>(2) Dumbarton Oaks Conference</p>
<p>(3) Yalta Conference</p>
<p>(4) Mexico City Conference</p>
<p>(5) San Francisco Conference</p>
<p>(6) Potsdam and Beyond</p>
<p>(7) American Voters and International Organizations</p>
<p>There are also many important international documents attached, which are indeed available for reference in the study of international issues.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Dean's Portrait</h3>
<h3>About "About Women"</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>In the past, I have read Bing Xin's novels, poems, essays,... I love her clear and detached writing style, poetic heart, and philosophy; like lyrical movements, the dongxiao flute on a peaceful lake and autumn moon night, elegant Chinese paintings, light strokes and light descriptions.</p>
<p>She loves nature, praises the sea, sings the praises of maternal love, has compassion, pity, and a compassionate heart, the most beautiful and perfect feelings. Her thoughts are like white doves flying in the clear sky, without the soaring of eagles, without the enthusiastic cries of cicadas in summer, but leaning towards the light, even making the beautiful blue sky more lovely.</p>
<p>This time, Bing Xin used the pen name and position of a "gentleman" to write "About Women." It is really superfluous to introduce such a good book as "About Women." I don't know how many readers have read it before me, and I don't know how many people have read it more than once like me, but I always feel that there is something to say, so I forgive my nosy.</p>
<p>This book has a total of sixteen sections, describing fourteen women of different identities and personalities. These fourteen women are the mothers, teachers, wet nurses, classmates, classmates, students, landlords, neighbors, helpers, wives and mothers of friends, and wives of younger brothers of a "gentleman who I respect and care for the most"... That "gentleman who I respect and care for the most" is the pseudonym and incarnation of Bing Xin. That gentleman is fictitious, because the "gentleman" himself is a lady. However, the fourteen women described in the book do not belong to nothingness. Yesterday, today, tomorrow, here, there, and in some more distant place, I have seen them, you have seen them, and they have all seen them...</p>
<p>Why use this pseudonym? Perhaps the author has more affectionate feelings when writing? Readers have more real feelings when reading? I think so?</p>
<p>These fourteen women are not amazingly talented, nor do they have great achievements. None of them are angels, and none of them are saints, but it can also be said that each of them is an angel, and each of them is a saint. The author writes in the "Postscript": "...Women seem to value the love of parents and children, the love of brothers and sisters, the love of husband and wife, the love of friends... She is willing to sacrifice everything for the object she loves. In fact, it is not a question of whether she is willing or not. She sacrifices unconditionally and loves without regard to consequences..." What is greater than sacrifice in the world? Unconditional sacrifice, selfless sacrifice, love first and then talk; not an angel is also an angel, not a saint is also a saint.</p>
<p>The lives of these fourteen women are like water flowing in a stream, flowing quietly; there are no heroic stories of raging waves, nor bizarre and winding fates. They live very plainly, but who can we deny? - That moving plainness is more moving than the winding movement. They naturally did not attract the broad attention of most people, but each of them has left the deepest eternal memory in the hearts of everyone who loves them. Their names are not left in history, but every smile and sigh of theirs is left in the memories of family and friends.</p>
<p>Of course, the author seems to have forgotten those bad, unkind, and evil women, but we must remember that the author of this book is a "gentleman who I respect and care for the most", so it is all biased towards the good side.</p>
<p>After reading "About Women", I feel that the elegant Chinese paintings are more fascinating, the sound of the flute on a moonlit night is particularly moving, and the music is more filled with many substantial emotions than before, the most precious things in life...</p>
<p>Finally, I want to quote what the author said in the postscript: "...She has more colors than men, and more sounds... If there were no women in the world, this world would at least lose five-tenths of "truth," six-tenths of "goodness," and seven-tenths of "beauty"... Is this right? Not to mention that I dare not say it, I dare not even ask it, and I dare not even think about it. I am nervously paranoid to guess that maybe Bing Xin had to use a pseudonym for these few words. I think the most appropriate answer should be the nodding or shaking of heads of gentlemen!</p>

<h3>Yang Zhixiong Come Out</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Agency has a piece of news talking about Yang Zhixiong, the former chairman of the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, being suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. The argument of this news is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Background: Yang Zhixiong once served as a compradore of the German Siemens Foreign Firm in this city for as long as twenty-five years. A few months before the victory, under the instigation of the German overseas Chinese, he went to the mainland to seek the official position of the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee. All the expenses were supplied by the German overseas Chinese, so after the victory, Yang was ordered to come to Shanghai to handle the affairs of the German Overseas Chinese Management, with great power in his hands, and everything went as he wished.</p>
<p>(2) Facts: The list of German overseas Chinese submitted by the German Consulate to Yang totaled 2,500 people. After examination and management, the number of German overseas Chinese was only more than 1,910, and after further review, more than 600 German overseas Chinese were approved to stay in China due to illness and other reasons, and only more than 800 were waiting to return home.</p>
<p>(3) Recent Result: The United States Associated Press spread the news that the Management Committee took the opportunity to extort gold bars and harbor Nazi elements.</p>
<p>Whether this news is true, we dare not make a hasty judgment at this time. If it is not, it is hoped that Yang Zhixiong will stand up immediately.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the authorities should thoroughly investigate to find out the truth.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of much corruption and much dereliction of duty. What we are afraid of is corruption and dereliction of duty without handling it, and without handling it thoroughly!</p>
<h3>蠄蟝洞</h3>
<p>— By Fang Jun</p>
<p>On the Aberdeen side of Hong Kong, amidst the shimmering green waves (only during clear, calm weather), there are more than just one "Qin Qu" caves, but outsiders are unable to find them. However, if one wishes to inquire like a fisherman, even an outsider can "look, inquire, and reach the destination" (though it doesn't actually have a door). In reality, the so-called "Qin Qu" cave is merely a symbolic term, not a real cave. However, the insult implied by this term is quite strong. Precisely because it is so strong, these so-called "Qin Qu" have a way to make a living.</p>
<p>Visiting "Qin Qu" caves is a kind of entertainment for the people of Hong Kong. The enjoyment and pleasure derived from it are quite different from those found in Tangxi, yet it shares similarities with the waters of Shau Kei Wan. However, Shau Kei Wan has a deterring aspect, due to the notorious presence of lurking leper women. In reality, who in Aberdeen dares to say that there are no hidden seeds of this terror? However, the environment there is somewhat better than that of Shau Kei Wan.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Hong Kong, eight years ago, my relatives and friends, eager to fulfill their duty as hosts, took me to all the fun places in Hong Kong. Visiting "Qin Qu" caves was one of the items on the itinerary.</p>
<p>My close relative, Mr. Chen, was a leading broker in a foreign firm in Hong Kong, and also an expert in playing around in this mountain city. He had his own car, and could take me to play anywhere, no matter how far. One Sunday morning, he took me to Aberdeen to play, accompanied by one of his younger brothers and two close friends. He and those two friends addressed each other as brothers, and although they weren't sworn brothers, they were very close, practically business partners with shared interests. As for me, I only found them unbearably vulgar.</p>
<p>Aberdeen is famous in Hong Kong for its seafood. There are two restaurants there, one named "Zhen Nan" and the other "Lu Shan," both renowned for their seafood cuisine. Later, an old, dilapidated "Zi Dong" boat was transferred from the Pearl River, slightly repaired, and turned into a floating restaurant, stealing a lot of business from "Zhen Nan" and "Lu Shan."</p>
<p>That morning, we arrived in Aberdeen, parked the car under a large banyan tree, and walked towards an area by the sea where many Tanka women were standing. Seeing us approaching, the Tanka women raised their high-pitched voices and shouted at us. My close relative took the lead, choosing a young Tanka girl and asking to ride in her boat. She led us down to the boat and rowed us towards the green waves. In less than half an hour, we arrived at the so-called "Qin Qu" cave. An old, ugly woman emerged from the "Qin Qu" cave, shrilly calling "Young Master"... At the same time, a "Qin Qu," just one "Qin Qu," also emerged, a gaudily dressed woman with a giggling face.</p>
<p>The "Qin Qu" cave was just a medium-sized wooden boat. The "Qin Qu" were the water prostitutes there. A round awning covered the center, under which was the place for resting. Inside the cabin, on the side near the oar, there were layers of wooden shelves. On the shelves were shrines, mirrors, cups, plates, and miscellaneous items, all neatly arranged and exceptionally clean. We got on board from the small boat, climbed into the central cabin, took off our shoes, and sat on either side of the awning. The "Qin Qu" served clear tea, and my close relative busied himself with arranging the agenda. First, he ordered several "Qin Qu" to be summoned, one for each person. Second, he ordered a certain amount of opium (smoking paraphernalia readily available in the boat). Third, a set of mahjong tiles. Fourth, four kinds of seafood, along with soup, Yangzhou fried rice, and one pound of steamed pork. Once the program was set, he instructed the old, ugly woman to prepare it. My close relative and his two close friends started singing Tanka songs, while his younger brother teased the "Qin Qu."</p>
<p>One couldn't stand up inside the cabin. I was unfamiliar with everything, so I craned my neck to look at the green mountains and green waters. The green mountains were ever young, the mountain flowers were charming, and the old trees were lush, but the salty, fishy smell constantly assaulted my nostrils, making me feel that it was a pity. So I went out of the cabin, looking down at the green waves. Tiny, needle-like fish were chasing each other in groups in the green waves, making my hands itch. I took out a handkerchief, tied it into a net, and tried to scoop them up. However, although the fish were tiny, they were incredibly agile. After much effort, I managed to catch two, which jumped restlessly in the handkerchief net. I took them into the cabin, but no one gave them a second glance. The "Qin Qu" came over and said they were "groupers," less than a day old. I played with them for a while, then threw them back into the green waves. Two tiny splashes appeared on the surface of the sea, and then they disappeared.</p>
<p>Soon, "Qin Qu" arrived one after another from another small boat, crude, foolish, and obese, not worth a second glance, and their voices were croaking, deafening. After everyone had finished smoking opium and playing mahjong, the seafood was delivered from outside. Everyone was full and drunk, and the sun was setting. My legs were numb, and then the pain became unbearable. I thought to myself, curled up for half a day, with nowhere to stretch my legs, visiting "Qin Qu" caves was truly a great hardship. Although I didn't say it explicitly at the time, I dared not entertain the thought of being a "Liu Lang who crossed again" when my close relative invited me again later.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) All "Qin Qu" have the insect radical.</p>
<h3>Seeking Love is Not a Crime</h3>
<p>— By Xun Jie</p>
<p>July 1st News: Li Fukang, the principal of Wuxi Model Accounting Tutoring School, around thirty years old, wrote a love letter to a certain female student to court her. The female student read the letter aloud in public. Fearing that the situation would escalate, Li apologized to the students and wrote a confession. The students then sent five representatives to the education section of the county government to request an investigation, etc.</p>
<p>Although this matter is small, it concerns the dignity of teachers, the purity of education, and the priceless love in life! I personally have a few thoughts!</p>
<p>Speaking about the matter itself, a dignified principal, bearing the sacred mission of educating talents and saving social morals, should not rashly write a letter to a female student, whom he knows and who doesn't know him, to talk about love!</p>
<p>However, coming back to the point, humans are emotional beings. The feudal thoughts of the old society, such as "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving" and "should a brother-in-law extend a hand to help his drowning sister-in-law?" should have been broken in the new era!</p>
<p>Love has no class concept. As long as both parties agree and can truly love each other, whether teacher, student, rich, poor, noble, or lowly, there can be a possibility of a fulfilling union.</p>
<p>If Li's letter only expressed his inner admiration and the hope of slowly progressing from friendship, without any obscene words or threatening coercion, then this letter should not be regarded as an illegal or improper letter.</p>
<p>If Li has not been married, then he did not violate the law by writing a letter to a female student he admires to express his love. This letter is only a medium for soliciting the other party's opinion, with no malicious intent and no infringement on the other party's freedom!</p>
<p>The fact that he is a principal only means that he is more talented and knowledgeable than others. It cannot be said that just because he is a principal, he should give up on love. Moreover, he is legally and properly soliciting the other party's consent with a letter, which is not excessive. If he were not a principal, but a male classmate in his thirties, perhaps the female student who received this letter would treat it calmly.</p>
<p>When disagreeing with someone's reasonable request, it is enough to refuse them frankly. If someone expresses sincere admiration and expresses it frankly, not only is it rejected, but it is also made embarrassing and even thoroughly investigated, which, in my personal opinion, seems a bit too much.</p>
<p>In civilized countries, this kind of thing is not surprising, because in the civilized world, love is public, frank, and ardent. As long as it does not go beyond the legal track, expressing love to someone you admire is not a big deal. At the same time, the person being shown love also has the same freedom to accept or reject the love. On the contrary, they should even express gratitude to the person who admires her (or him), and if they cannot accept it, they should also politely decline.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that the occurrence of this kind of thing is very natural, but the reason why it is shocking is still due to the lack of eradication of feudal thoughts in society. The fault is not with Li Fukang, nor with a certain female student, but with the remnants of feudal thoughts in the entire society!</p>
<h3>The Shortest Letter</h3>
<p>— By Zhong Qi</p>
<p>"A British merchant, due to his busy schedule, wrote a letter to his son, who was studying in another city, telling him to keep his future letters as brief as possible. Soon, the merchant received a letter from his son:</p>
<p>S·O·S (Save Our Souls),</p>
<p>·S·D (Money),</p>
<p>RSVP (Répondez S'il Vous Plaît).</p>
<p>The letter contained only three sentences, and all used abbreviations, but the meaning was fully conveyed.</p>
<p>(Note) S·O·S· is the distress signal in telegraphy. ·S·D· represents pounds, shillings, and pence. RSVP means "please reply" and is commonly used on invitation cards."</p>

<h3>A Dentist Gets Rich but Blames Others for Corruption</h3>
<p>— By Feng Yi</p>
<p>The American magazine "Life" reported: The corrupt atmosphere in China has affected the American staff working in China. A dentist, after arriving in China, found that the price of a set of dental equipment was more than ten times higher than in the United States. So, after making a fortune, he returned to the United States.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that one's reputation should not be "spoiled," otherwise other people's mistakes will be blamed on you. But how many people can fight for this and be able to have a clear conscience?</p>
<p>After a failed speculation, swindling gold bars and fleeing seems to have become a recent trend. The best way to punish them is to confine them in a gold vault, and wait until they are hungry and cannot eat, and cold and cannot wear clothes, and then see if they are still interested?</p>
<p>Glass belts, when they are worn around the waist, feel unbearably vulgar.</p>
<p>Shanghai's cholera, under the propaganda offensive, has not only not been deterred, but has become even more rampant. For these things, we hope that gentlemen will use their hands and not just their mouths.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu told reporters from the United Press that Shanghai's environment is not suitable for price controls. This is a sincere remark. Taking rice prices as an example, the black market price has indeed risen to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Banned square-shaped publications are not all pornographic, and pornographic publications are not all square-shaped. This has the same principle as the fact that one cannot judge a person's character by their appearance.</p>
<p>Jeeps are not allowed to carry young women, but it is not said that young women cannot ride in jeeps. So not allowing them to be carried is one thing, and sitting is another.</p>
<h3>Reply to the Flies in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— By Jin Kai</p>
<p>Dear flies in the countryside: We are very grateful that you care about our living situation! It is indeed very dangerous to live in the city. You really wouldn't believe it! We live here relatively safely and don't feel anything, although recently DDT has been attacking us, but we seem to be protected by God. No matter how strong the medicine is or how strict the orders are, I believe we will never be wiped out in the city. Now, I will report our living conditions to you, so you can broaden your horizons and avoid being "unnecessarily worried" about us.</p>
<p>DDT's attacks on us are undeniably powerful, but we always feel that it is only a temporary trend. Therefore, we are currently working in groups and areas. For example, there are the Yangshupu District, the Caishi Street District (semi-urban), the Caojiadu District, the Nanshi District, etc. The lifestyles of the brothers in each district are generally the same, so I will not describe them in detail by district. When we wake up every morning in a public toilet, we fly in teams to the nearby small vegetable market. It can be considered a large cafeteria there, with everything imaginable. Eating meat and fish is commonplace. What suits our appetite the most is the salted meat that the villagers bring to sell. They sell half a salted pig for several days, and we "definitely" eat some here and suck some there during these days, and the taste seems to get better every day. But some brothers are also tired of eating it. Confucius didn't know the taste of meat for three months, how lucky are we? There are more fish foods, like squid, freshwater shrimp, yellow croaker, and dead eel are all delicacies. Think about you only eating the leftovers from pig swill and the urine and feces in the cesspool, there is a huge difference compared to us! There are also freshly上市 Ningbo salted crabs and Jiangbei dried shrimps, which can't be said not to be our seasonal vegetables! The most comfortable thing is that after we are full, we can take a nap on the chopping board in the butcher shop. The weather is hotter in the afternoon than in the morning, so we walk along the road, looking around. We see a banner on the road that says "Cholera is there every year, especially this year." We are so encouraged, because it gives us clear evidence of a busy and hard work! We fly along the road more and more happily, and we feel hot too. It doesn't matter, the good thing is that there are cold drink stalls along the way. We can also dip our lips in the leftover or completely uneaten milk, shaved ice juice, lemonade, etc. from people, and sweeten our mouths. A kind of fragrant aroma, I'm afraid you would also be drooling! In the evening when the sun sets, it is the time when we are tired of traveling and think about returning home; we casually find a hotel on the way home. We don't dare to taste the wine, but smelling the wine is also a romantic thing. In addition, the cooked meat stalls in front of the hotel are also our dining room. Pork head meat, smoked fish, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, deep-fried shrimp, five-spice beef... which one is not a top-class dish? You say our eating fortune is good, but you will probably be speechless when you see this letter! It's getting dark, we go home with a drunk feeling and look for dreams, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... we live steadily day after day like this, what's not happy? You tell me! A related report is that in addition to the above-mentioned foods, we can also bravely fly to the most lively downtown area to taste the taste of starving people's meat! You invite us to play in the countryside, but it is better for us to welcome you to visit here. Goodbye, I wish you a pleasant time! Yours sincerely, The Flies in the City</p>
<h3>Lament for My Youngest Son, Zaisen</h3>
<p>— By Han Sou, Aged Sixty-Eight</p>
<p>Your surname is Zhang, your given name Zaisen, you are from Chuansha County, Jiangsu. Your father, Zhihe, was a student. At the beginning of the Republic, he entered the Jiangsu Provincial Government, serving in education and civil administration successively, known for his integrity and incorruptibility. The establishment of new undertakings in Chuansha was largely due to his efforts. Your mother, Tang, gave birth to you in the northern township of Chuansha in the twelfth year of the Republic. After completing primary school, you entered the Shanghai Private Zhengshi Middle School. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Battle of Shanghai was fought bitterly for three months, but ultimately the city could not be defended. Young people sacrificed their lives for the country, one falling after another. You were greatly angered. At that time, you were a second-year student at a senior high school. You gave up your studies, left your family, and went to the interior, where you passed the entrance examination for the Artillery Department of the Chengdu Central Military Academy. In May of the thirty-first year of the Republic, you participated in the Jin-Qu Campaign as the commander of the mortar platoon in the Second Battalion, 314th Regiment, 105th Division of the Army. At first, you suffered setbacks and retreated. Later, you counterattacked, recovered Jiangshan, took Quzhou, and Longyou, confronting the enemy on the outskirts of Jinhua City. On the twenty-fifth day of September, a Mid-Autumn Festival moonlit night, you fought your way to Bailongqiao, thirty miles west of Jinhua City. As dawn approached, you were surrounded by an enemy army with overwhelming superiority. Unwilling to surrender, you committed suicide. You were twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>Alas, my son Zaisen, you have become a martyr for the country, and your ambition has been fulfilled. The Japanese invaders have finally surrendered, and you can be comforted. When you were about to graduate from military academy, you wrote in a letter that your body already belonged to the country. I did not possess such a son, but a selfish man of one family. In the past, Jian Shu's son was with the army, and he cried when he sent him off, saying that he would collect your bones. But when you left, on May 1, the 27th year of the Republic, you left without saying goodbye. At first, the family thought you were missing, but I was happy that you had ambition, hoping that you would return in glory. But now it is over, and there is no way to collect your bones, so what else can I say? You are my third son. Those who cast my horoscope have said that I would have two or three sons, or that I would have three sons, and that two sons would see me off in my final days. I hated it very much. When you were three years old, my younger brother Zhihu passed away without a son, and you were adopted as his heir, which seemed to confirm what was said before. But who knew that there was still more to come? You sent a letter from Pucheng County, Fujian, on July 12 of the thirty-first year of the Republic. After that, there was not a single word. Until now, in the spring of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, more than half a year after the surrender of the enemy, I still have not received definite news of you, and my heart is confused. Occasionally, in a pile of old papers, I found a piece of paper casting your horoscope, saying that at seventeen you would enter the Yi-Mao luck, and a big circle was drawn, saying that you could be earth-shattering, and after that there would be no more black dots, indicating that your life would end. Then I realized that you must have died. Sure enough, on a certain day in March, I received a pension document, waking me from a three- or four-year dream. And according to the previous and subsequent horoscopes, is it credible? According to the investigation, you died in battle on September 25 of the thirty-first year of the Republic, which is the sixteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. The counterattack on Jinhua was 16th day of the first month of the twelfth year of the Republic, that is, the thirtieth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, and you had not yet reached the age of twenty. According to the lunar calendar, you were twenty-one years old. You, the adopted son of my younger brother, died at the age of twenty-three. Your life was even shorter. My younger brother worked at the arsenals in the three northeastern provinces. You graduated from the sixteenth class of the Artillery Department of the Central Military Academy, went to the front line to resist the enemy, and reached the rank of captain in the army, belonging to the Second Battalion, 314th Regiment, 105th Division, commanding the mortar platoon. Both generations tested their talents for the first time, and then died young. Heaven, what is my love guilty of, that the misfortune extends to the younger branch, and that it is stingy with its sacrifices? I will tell your two older brothers that they should also establish an heir for you in the future, to extend the sacrifices of my younger brother and to comfort his spirit. If you have knowledge, please tell them, alas.</p>

<h3>A Traitor's Door Produces a Filial Daughter Who Can Be Filial but Cannot Be Loyal</h3>
<p>— By Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Jiang Zhaoju, the daughter of the North China traitor Jiang Kanghu, insisted on entering the prison to serve her father, who was in custody and ill. Because she was not allowed, she even refused to eat or sleep, crying outside the courtyard all day long and waving her away. The warden was moved by her, and only then allowed her to enter the prison twice a day to serve medicine and food, so as to fulfill her filial piety. It is rare that a filial daughter is actually produced by the door of a traitor. It is a pity that she knows the great righteousness of ethics and morality, but she could not make a remonstrance when Jiang went against the country, so as to prevent her father from becoming a criminal of the country and nation. If not only filial piety, but also loyalty, it would not be necessary to cry and seek to enter the prison to serve medicine and food today.</p>
<p>After Chen Gongbo was shot, recently a young man went to the Suzhou Funeral Home to write a memorial essay for him, and left in a hurry after the ceremony. Those who saw his memorial essay only signed the word "Yu," and no one knew who he was. This is exactly what is called "a stranger hangs for the dead, but the dead can't tell."</p>
<p>In the major corruption case of the Lianglu Administration, the main culprit was a woman—the wife of the director of the materials department, who is still at large. The reason for the major corruption was that the director's soul fell into the hands of the wife's party. The reason why the wife incited her husband to commit adultery and violate the law is speculated to be because she has an opium addiction, and the salary income of the road bureau is limited, so she cannot be as happy as she wants. When Director Chen Bozhuang summoned more than 300 employees for a speech, he said that the treatment of employees has been adjusted to ensure that the minimum living standards of employees are resolved. In order to maintain the integrity of public officials, it is necessary to stabilize their lives first; but if you take the salary that is only enough to maintain the minimum living standards, but want to enjoy extra benefits, then you will never be able to do it well. This couple of the materials department probably made this point.</p>
<p>The people of Hiroshima are talking about nuclear weapons. The United Nations observers all felt disappointed with this time. The Soviet professor shrugged and said: "It's nothing." This is the different feeling between the victim and the by stander.</p>
