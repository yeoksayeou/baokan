<h3>吳敬恒氏閉幕詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國民大會閉幕典禮中，大會主席吳敬恒致詞，全文如下：「各位代表先生，我們道大會開會之時，我說過是我們中華民國最可紀念，最愉快的一天，因爲開國民大會，是國父念念不忘最希望的一件事。開了國民大會，必定製出一個中華民國的圓滿憲法，將他建造的中華民國的政權，交付給中國國民，本了一個圓滿憲法，可以把中華民國在世界上永遠成功一個富强康樂之國。果然一開會，經國民政府主席把一個再三斟酌完善的憲草交到大會，這大會代表精心討論了一個多月，便製成了今大圓滿成功的一個很前進的憲法基督着三民主義，成功民有·民治·民享的共和國憲法，爲世界共和國最新的憲法。國父在天之靈，必非常愉快，國父貢獻他的　國同胞一個三民主義，請他同胞做了基礎，製出最圓滿最民主的憲法，他便達了他的熱望。他是很贊同孔子的禮讓爲國，同時亦能贊成老子的長而不宰，做了臨時總統，馬上可以讓給別人，又爲而不有，他有最好的主義，不私他的同黨，他早早寫成建國大綱，渴望開成國民大會，還政於民，因此，這大會的各位代表亦一致尊重國父的作爲，都能切合禮讓。禮讓兩個字，在禮的方面，討論不肯含糊，甚而大聲的爭論，在讓的方面，一經多數決議，馬上心平氣和的不爭，這恰恰與各國最前進的議會代表毫無二致，故能製出今天最圓滿，最民主的中化民國新憲法。現在就這第一次大會可以做今後各次大會的模範，不達個人的主張事小，做模範事大，所以又可以佩服這次代表的氣量。現在就此把這憲法送父國民政府主席、請他擇吉頒布，依法交與民選政府施行，使我中華民國永遠成爲世界上一個當强康樂之國。今天我們代表不敢吿老，得此榮幸開會之中，感謝全體國民隱爲大會後盾，故能得此成功，藉此敬祝四百五十兆同胞康寗福壽。</p>
<h3>中宣部招待記者　王寵惠氏談憲法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕中宣部廿五日午十二時，舉行記者招待會，王寵惠博士就憲法的要點，即席發表書面談話稱：國大制定的憲法，經過十年以上準備，五五草憲公布後，因抗戰倥偬，制憲工作不得不遲延到勝利以後。今年初舉行政協會議，各黨派代表，社會豎達均參加，並曾協議五五憲草修正原則若干條，此次政府向國民大會所提出的憲草，即是依據政協修正原則而改訂的，國民大會雖有增損，面政治協商所協議的要點，則均列入憲法。</p>
<h3>國民黨如開　黨團檢討會</h3>
<p>廿七起舉行兩天</p>
<p>〔本報席京廿五日電〕國民黨因各省黨務人員來京出席國大，刻以大會業已閉幕，決定即召開一黨團檢討會議，定邪惡七日舉行，會期兩日。聞除檢討黨務工作外，幷將就新憲宣布後，黨務工作有所商討。</p>
<h3>憲草三讀已完成　少數代表仍反對官吏任國大代表　經蔣主席訓示後始平息</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國大第廿次會，廿五日晨十時舉行，出席代表蔣中正等一四八五人，開會時爲一三七六人，主席于右任，報吿員宣讀十九次會議紀錄後，胡適於噓噓聲中登發言台，報吿憲草修正案整理小組工作經過，胡氏詞畢，於噓噓聲中下台。上午十時廿分開始三讀工作，由于主席於會衆之掌聲中逐條　過，第廿六條對國大代表之選舉之規定，有代表提出自由職業團體選舉問題，經雷副秘書長答稱：該條第六項之「職業團體」包括自由職業團體，綜合審委會有記錄。至第廿八條因第三項官吏可否當選爲國大代表之問題，引起軒然大波，于主席甫經讀畢該項條文，倪弼即在樓廳激烈聲稱：「這一項規定，違反民主原則，不能通過，我們不能作國父的叛徒，不能作萬世的罪人。」響應者隨聲而起，攘臂高呼：「打倒食官汚吏！」「打倒官僚主義！」並紛紛要求表決，于氏置之不顯，續讀以下條文，秩序因之大亂，羣起斥責主席違法，要求將該條付諸表決。于則謂三讀只修正文字，不能作原則之更改，會衆怒吼！「依照國大組織法第十二條，制憲法定人數的規定，要是沒有出席代表四分之三的通過，不能算數。」于氏乃與洪雷兩秘長商議後，由雷宣讀議事規則第三十七·三十八兩條謂：「三　會僅得爲文字上之更正，除發現議案有互相抵觸外，不得爲修正之動議。且三讀會只議決議案，全體之可吾，不能有所更改。」一部會衆鼓掌支持，但反對者仍然不服，羣稱：「我們不要更改，只要求依法表決，制憲不是兒戲，打倒官僚主義！」一時勢成僵局。</p>
<p>至十時四十分，蔣代表中正衣綠色軍便服登發言台稱：「代表諸公，各位是代表全國人民來開會的，應遵守會議的規則，作全國人民的種範，議事規則的有關規定，已經秘書長宣續，並解釋得很明白，要依秩序進行三　工作。」蔣氏辭畢後，於大鼓掌中下台落座。但三數代表仍高呼：「請依法表決表決。」蔣乃再度登台發言：「各位代表如果再要求表決，發生了違反議事規則的結果，你們是要負責的。」一場狂瀾怒潮。始告平息。繼續讀憲工作，十時四十五分，雷副秘長代巷于主席，自第五章開始續　，除於第六十四條聲明立委選舉之規定第六款「職業團體」包括自由職業團體，綜合審委會有記錄，並將各代表所提第「七八」「一〇八」「一一一」「一四六」等條之文字，修正議案即交小組整理外，均經順和讀過‘十一時三十七分，第一七五條讀過三　，於以完畢，會衆大鼓掌達一分鐘之久。</p>
<p>旋胡適復於噓噓聲中報吿，適間小組整理結果；胡辭畢，於噓噓聲中下台後，書副秘長報吿第一七七四條第一項末「及出席代表四分之三之決議」第二「三十七」字漏印，另第七十條之「決議」字樣，經會衆質問後復維持「提議」原文，至十一時四十五分，于主席稱，「贊成中華民國憲法的請起立」，全體應聲粛然起立，水銀燈　之大明，攝影機軋軋大　全體代表於是大鼓掌並歡呼萬歲落座。少頃　副秘長宣布：「出席在場代表一四八五人全部起立贊成，憲法全文通過」。繼開始憲法施行日期之討論，以一〇五四票之絕對多數通過：「三十六年十二月廿五日爲行憲日期」雷副秘書長報告表決結果，並聲稱：主席　於數會後開會，閉幕典禮於午後舉行，其他事務秘書處有書面通知，後於十一時五十五分散會，此最後一次會議，乃告結束。</p>
<h3>民社黨發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕中國民主社會黨，廿四日發表聲明稱：本月廿四本黨接得民盟來函，關於本黨退盟事，茲發表公開聲明如次：</p>
<p>本年八月二十九日，本黨曾有一函致民盟，要求「民盟重要聲明，均須預先取得本黨同意」此函在邏輯上，並不包含本黨重要舉措，均須預先取得民盟同意，民盟乃應時代要求的一廣大的爭取民主的聯合體，本黨原爲發起人之一，自與海外民主憲政黨合併，改組爲民主社會黨後，爲表示本黨立塲，乃有八月二十九日對民盟之聲明·此次參加國大，所民完成憲法，所以期望以憲政代替訓政，較之於停滯在專政階段有進一步，本黨旣無武力，又無地盤，對於接近民主之路，豈能舍而不顧，本黨同仁受决多數人民淪於破產慘罹戰禍之呼聲所感動，自問可吿無罪。今接民盟來函謂：「碍難在本盟內繼續合作」；本黨自有主義，自有政鋼，與與其因　掛而起糾紛，自不如各自獨立之爲得計。至於爭取和平，實現民主與夫軍隊國家化之主張，同仁旣已揭　於先，自當努力貫澈於後，其與本黨同此宗旨者，一切皆可合作。至於本黨黨員參加民盟者，在此情形下，本黨當依據本黨黨章處理之。</p>

<h3>大連事件蘇並不違法　美國務院暫不干涉　惟紐約輿論界仍極端重視</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務院新聞發布員懷　今日答覆記者詢問稱：大連蘇軍當局上星期五命　船一艘於停留港內　四十八小時後離開大連，係屬合法行動，蘇聯當局並有權拒絕船上美國商人，新聞記者及攝影師各一人登岸，此二人事先均未獲得蘇聯正式許可。美國外交官報告，已證實美記者牛頓所報道之事實殊爲正確。惟於蘇軍當局曾口頭提出哀的美教　，限令美船於二十分鍾內離港，否則不負責任一節，尚未能確切證明。國務院根據所獲初步報告，現時轉取不干預態度，但此並非最後決定。該船係運送供應品及外交郵件至大連美總領事署者，曾按照慣例通知蘇聯當局，經准許停留港內四十八小時，履行正式任務，未受阻撓。惟船上所載新聞記者兩人及商人一名，未經聲請入境，該船在港期內，美總領事企圖代爲邀准，惟大連蘇聯當局謂非經莫斯科准許，無權令其進口。該船於超過原定四十八小時停泊期限後兩小時即行離開大連。按照去年八月中蘇條約規定，大連本爲一自由商港，由中國管理，惟中蘇兩國政府尚未商定接管辦法，故大連仍在蘇聯軍事管理之下。美政府希望其能早日議定移轉管理辦法，但承認此事應由兩國政府處理云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿五日電〕美國海軍船一艘被蘇聯當局逐出大連一事，中國政府發言人昨日拒絕發表意見。官方人士今日稱：此舉不足爲異，因中蘇條約雖規定雙方聯合管理大連，但中國海軍船隻　無法開入大連也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕關於大連蘇軍驅逐美艦一節，紐約各報今日仍極注意，各朝報仍以第一版之顯著地位刊載。斯克利浦斯霍華德系報記者牛敦爲聯合各報所撰之遲到通訊，然迄目前止，僅有紐約時報予以評論。紐約時報以一欄半之篇幅，及四行之標題，將該消息作爲今日最重要之消息刊載，並附有地圖標題稱：蘇軍向美艦提出最後通牒，迫令離開大連，並警告於二十分鍾內離開，否則將有嚴重後果之危險。各記者與石油商人，均被禁止登岸，共和黨之前　論壇報未予批評，僅於第一版以四行標題刊稱：「蘇軍迫令美艦離開大連，美艦此次係向大連作例行之訪問，但受二十分鍾內即應離開之命令，記者二人及美商人一人，均被禁止登岸。」其他各朝報，亦以顯著地位及大字標題，刊載該消息。</p>
<h3>美記者所見　鐵幕後之大連</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕合眾社據代表世界報界之克利浦斯霍華德系報紙特派記者牛敦大連二十日電：（遲到）蘇聯顯　保持其對「東北門戶」大連之完全控制，而將繼續保持駐該地之軍隊，直至簽訂對日和約時止。此將在中蘇友好條約中關於大連一節之技術解釋之下見諸事實。據該節規定：「大連在平時並不包括在一九四五年八月十四日對旅順協定所決定之海軍基地條款之有效範圍內，而僅於對日作戰時始歸入本區之軍事監督或管制」　結即在「平時」之字句技術上，在對日和約簽訂之前，中蘇兩國仍處於對日作戰狀態之下。前　美海軍差船前往大連之美記者二人，雖遭大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫中將摒斥於大連之外，但大連在蘇軍統治下之一般情形，仍可由中立及中國人士方面獲知一二，此一充滿憂欎及冷酷之城市。在蘇聯鐵幕之下，備受限制，市內惟一通用之貨幣爲蘇軍用票。工業陷於麻痹，飢餓與失業極爲普遍，物價奇昂，市內僅有三處建築物有抵禦東北嚴寒之暖氣設備。在戰前及太平洋戰爭期間，一向居於大連之中俄平民，日陷困苦及恐懼之深淵中，無人敢與常　蘇方監視之美人接近，人民絕少能　　蘇軍當局之逮捕與懲罰，更連論言論或新聞自由。據可靠消息：當地某一中文報紙，在其共黨發行人「　思及若干反美論調」時，即可偶然出版一次。蘇軍虐待中國及白俄居民之事，日有所聞，因抱有「大連之權必須由中國恢復」之思想而被蘇方逮捕之中國靑年學子，爲數甚多，市內到處可見類如史達林像或其他蘇聯顯赫人物畫之宣傳圖片；除此之外，尚有向當地飢餓失業之中國居民，宣傳「逐出美國人後和平及繁榮始有希望」等一類標語，但蘇軍卻充分使用美國租借物資，如艦船，飛機，汽車及其他物資。在大連所見惟一紅軍運輸艦，即爲美國所建者。大連之恐懼空氣，不僅限於中國居民，甚至蘇人亦所不免，當地蘇方官員之　一舉動，均受莫斯科控制，而蘇方軍事或外交代表，亦在恐怖生活之中，若輩必須小心翼翼，勿得踰越克里姆林宮所指示之範圍一步。觀察家僉信即因上述恐懼，遂使大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫向美差船發出最後通牒，（限於二十分鍾內離港，否則吾人對發生之後果不負責任。）</p>

<h3>黃河堵口困難多　石料尚須五萬公方亟待趕運　堵復局視察隊竟遭共軍射擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封廿五日電〕花園口工程最困難部份，業已拋填出水，全工可望於淩汎前完成，惟工需石料尚短少五萬公方，必須於明年一月十五日以前運至工地，以現在平漢　海兩路運石情形，倘不嚴限如期如數搶運，屆時恐難運足，則淩汎一屆，橋樑發生危險，勢將前功盡棄，黃河堵復工程局，特分電各方呼籲。又黃河水利委員會趙委員長守鈺，昨赴花園口工地視察，花園口堵復局擬於最近堵口門，使水流復歸故道，同時爲免下游出險，該局副局長齊壽安，工程處長門振興，　與塔德顧問，會同駐汴中共代表趙明甫等，十六日由汴赴魯共區查勘復堤工程，卒因遭遇種種阻碍，不得已中途折返，廿二日由汴抵鄭。據朱局長光彩談：齊副局長等十六日出發，將抵荷澤臨濮集時，共軍即向彼等所乘汽車射擊百餘發，但卒冒險突過，安然進泰，十七日赴李進士堂，行經　日時，復遭共軍射擊，次日繼續向壽張縣屬之張秋鎮前進，至半途，共軍又復來襲，當時申共代表趙明甫所乘汽車落後甚遠，及至趕前時，槍聲始止。後至張秋鎮，即共軍冀魯豫邊區行署所在地，遂進行商談，共方當即提出三點（一）花園口堵口日期未經共方同意；（二）一百五十億救濟費未全數收到；（三）對救濟物資分配不滿，並謂：若因此三點而招致一切惡果，概由對方（指政府）負責。最後復以濟南以南張秋以北地方，雙方均無駐軍，無法保障安全等語相恫嚇，齊等無奈乃折返。</p>
<h3>美記者致蘇軍司令函</h3>
<p>〔聯合社大連廿日電〕（遲到）因遭拒絕，未能在大連登岸之美記者兩人，曾致函大連蘇軍司令高柴諾夫質問，信中聲稱：「吾人要求享受蘇聯新聞記者在海外美軍佔領區內享受之待遇及權利以及各國記者在中國政府統轄區內所享受之待遇及權利。吾人未敢遽信大連蘇聯官員欲隱瞞任何情形，藉以掩人耳目。大連爲遠東良港，世界各國對之均切實注意，據吾人觀察所得，知貴國仍在大連港內使用美國自由型運輸船，貴國軍隊所乘及所用者爲美國吉普車，附近蘇軍機塲中降落及起飛者亦爲美國飛機。此項配備旣由美國政府在戰時給予貴國，則吾人欲一觀貴國在戰後如何使用此項物資，自信當非無理要求。」惟高柴諾夫對此函未予置答。</p>

<h3>共軍在華北發動攻勢　保定城郊起激戰　平外圍不靖決加緊綏靖</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿五日電〕據可靠情報，共軍決定針對國大之圓滿閉幕，在華北發動全面攻勢，各地共軍調動頻聞，行見戰火勢即燒蔓各地，有關方面表示，國軍已有週密準備，共軍此一陰謀，可能迅被遏止。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕共軍在保定西北受挫後，其勢仍不衰退，至距滿城十華里之國軍，已回撤至保西廿里，惟滿城一日在共軍手，則保定一日不安，故該城仍將爲兩軍之爭奪地。保南之于家莊，方順橋，以至望都間，復爲共軍所控制，但望都國軍猶待保定之補給，故此地區間有獲補給品之大軍通過。平保段今日已試車，情形尚稱良好，惟共軍先已調集大軍於漕河徐水間鐵路兩側，未來之通車困難仍多。涿縣西方亦到雜以民兵之共軍萬餘人。共軍之再集重兵於平漢北段，似因國軍兵力單薄之故。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿五日電〕共軍野戰第八旅及孟慶巴部七十，八十二兩團，廿四日晨二時分向保垣外圍十五里之南北大冉，東西石橋及距城南卅里之貢　等地猛攻，迄廿五日晨，仍在激戰。又共軍野戰第十一旅，由滿城竄漕河北姚村一帶，廿四日晨向徐水漕河頭間國軍砲擊。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕國軍掃蕩冀東北寗路東地區竣事，共軍四千餘人化整爲零，在國軍向海濱推進之絕對優勢扇形陣地縫隙中逃逸，一部竄往路西，久被共軍控制之冀東渤海河岸地區，已在國軍保護下。</p>
<h3>共軍屢攻終未獲逞　魯聊城形勢趨穩　軍民艱苦抗拒轉危爲安</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日電〕濟南外　最突出據點之聊城，邇又遭共軍猛烈圍擊，該城昔爲東昌府城，徒駭河·運河交流於此，而成該城天然護城河，國軍困守經年，共軍進攻迄未得下，本月二十日起，共軍又利用天寒水凍，集結精銳，附砲多門，向城猛撲達三晝夜，先後裏脅民眾。廣置雲梯，踏水爬城亦十餘次。城內軍民在王金祥專員率領下，奮勇抗拒，城吿無恙，至廿三日晚，共軍仍將砲火集中東門，不斷轟擊，至十時被擊燬丈餘，缺口達二處，共軍乃蜂擁前進，國軍正以肉彈奮勇抗　，而城內一片號泣求援聲，亦正隨城之危急而有增無已中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕圍攻聊城共軍，昨晚起，在迫擊砲三，野砲一，掩護下，續向城垣猛撲，城內數萬軍民在澈底合作下，冒彈雨將東門缺口修復，並一鼓將共軍擊退，二十五日竟日大雪，情勢已稍穩定。</p>

<p>〔本報鎮江廿五日電〕（一）窰灣收復已證實，國軍正肅淸隴海以南邳宿睢境內之殘餘共軍。聞灌雲縣境內共軍，尚有三團之眾，惟戰志已喪失。（二）阜寗共軍因內閧甚烈，無力作戰，已有撤退模樣，阜寗在陽曆年內有重見天日可能。</p>

<h3>制憲大業的完成</h3>
<p>專爲制定中華民國憲法而召開的國民大會，業於昨日將憲法草案全部通過，宣告閉幕，此一隆重的制憲大業，於以完成。這在我國民族歷史上是空前的盛舉。如今中華民國憲法旣經制定，關於憲法的實施，亦已明定辦法，且國民大會在閉幕以前，確定憲法施行日期爲明年十二月二十五日，是則憲政開始有期，實在是慰一般人民喁喁之朝。對於這四十餘天來，國民大會各出席代表的　勞，全國人民無不深爲感奮。茲當國民大會閉幕，中華民國憲法制定之際，談向各代表表示中國人民一般的感謝。</p>
<p>這次憲法的制定是中國人民公意的表現。國民大會代表來自全國社會各階層，實爲全國民意最好的橫斷面。竭一千四百餘代表的　力，以四十一日的時間所通過的憲法，其間又曾有熱烈的辯論，再　的　重。故此次所通過的憲法，實是竭盡智慮爲一部可行的國家大法。這　　所規定的政　及其它的條款，容納了各方面的意見，尤能表示中正協和的精神，爲此次制憲的國民大會　下了永恒的光輝。　一國的憲法，爲國家的根本大法，當其制定，　　　　各方意見而爲各方所公　：必其能爲各方所公　，然後始能爲國家的大法。過去美國聯邦憲法的制定是如此。就是此次戰後法國的制憲，情形亦復相同。我國此次憲法的制定，繼美法兩先進民主國之成規，樹立了我國民主政治的基礎，此　爲中國政治上一個劃期的轉折點。</p>
<p>講劃憲法，憲法本身不僅是若干條文，而是一種活的·具有生命的創造物·憲法的制定僅能說是憲法的產生，像剛誕生的嬰兒一樣，它還得發育以至於長成。嬰兒的誕生是苦痛的，苦痛中產生了生命，但比誕生更艱辛的還有此後的養育使其達到成年。如今憲法旣已誕生，我們此後更應加意撫育這從痛苦中產生出來的嬰兒。我國憲法的先生，適在耶穌聖誕這一節日，也實在似乎不僅是一種偶然的巧合，耶穌是人類的救主，這部從痛苦中所產生出來的中國憲法，至少也應同樣能救我們的中國。耶穌聖誕這一天，又是我們的民族復興節，此次國民大會所制定的中華民國憲法適於此日完成，是誠足爲中國民族的復興的象徴。願全國人民愛護我們的憲法，使國家從此長治久安！</p>
<h3>黃金風潮</h3>
<p>以中央銀行連日拋售黃金的結果，金價終於慘跌了。兩日之間，從四百萬元的　關，跌到三百二十萬元，相差達八十萬元左右，其他美　·股票·香煙·紗布·綢緞等等，因此連帶下跌。有幾家小規模的銀樓·錢莊·銀行·以措手不及，甚至發生動搖，　息升到兩角以外，市塲上談虎色變，莫不深懷　懼。從這一點，我們對於下列　事可得到一個證明。</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行對於黃金市價，確有左右的能力。</p>
<p>（二）金價的漲落，確與物價有關，對於具有投機性的物品，其刺激尤烈。</p>
<p>（三）確有許多金融業·證券業·及普通商家，在經營着投機生意。</p>
<p>（四）有一部份小規模的金融業，其基礎殊欠穩固。</p>
<p>（五）銀根抽緊，便影響到拆息。</p>
<p>（六）銀根的抽緊或放寬，確操在中央銀行之手。</p>
<p>因爲有上述這一連串事實，互相關聯，所以聯想到以下的三件事。</p>
<p>金價的上落，其影響旣如是廣泛，而中央銀行又確具有控制的能力，則該行對於金價，應否隨時維持相當的水準？換句話說：讓牠飛漲到相當高的程度，然後用大壓力，把牠硬　下來，這方法是否賢明？假如早一點大量拋售，使牠抬不到四百萬元的高度，因此金融與物價的波動範圍，可以縮小一些，是不是於一般工商業，和一般民眾有利？這幾個問題，似乎值得研究。此其一。</p>
<p>中央銀行對於銀根及利率，顯然具有無上的威權。僅僅在黃金政策上小試其技，已夠使整個市塲，風翻浪湧，莫由自主。那麽，一般所痛心疾首的高利貸和周轉困難問題，在中央銀行似不難把握方針，予以適當的解決。就是說：現在工商業所苦心焦慮的問題，並不是沒有辦法。其唯一要點，只在財政和金融當局的見解究竟如何耳。此其二。</p>
<p>杜絕投機，嚴禁操縱等等，雖然過去已有不少的文吿。但從過去這幾日的市面看來，顯然還有好許多商家和金融家，依舊沉浸其中，樂而忘返。以後應當如何切實控制，導入正軌。尤其是從事金融業務的人，如何使他們懲前毖後，　然知返，以免牽動整個的市面，這實在是值得注意的問題。此其三。</p>
<p>陽歷年關，轉眼即至，陰歷年關又不在遠。在這工商業的危機十分嚴重的時候，大家兢兢業業，穩紮穩打，還恐意外風波，莫能倖免。照這幾日的情形看來，似乎大夢方酣，人事上·管理上·運用上·未臻健全的地方太多了。希望大家特別注意一下才　。</p>

<p>貧民在天寒呌苦的期間，正是宵小乘機活動的時候，這裏綏蜻當局鑒於蚌市人烟稠密父通繁複，五方雜處，良莠不齊，值此冬防時期，治安在在堪處，曾規定維護治安辦法四項，通飭遵行，四項辦法是：（一）加強盤查哨的檢查工作，以防奸究混入市塲，妨礙治安。（二）飭軍憲警聯合巡查隊切實執行命令，斜正服裝不整的軍人及取締散兵游勇。（三）每日夜派隊分段檢查商行旅館，妓院，及取締軍人狎妓，並堵絕不良份子匿跡其間。（四）調查本市居民戶籍移動，及淸查戶口，以防奸究潛伏。軍警機關雖是嚴厲執行，可是搶劫的案子，仍是迭出議起，本月六日晚，西市區黃山保居民陳宜之家，被匪徒十餘人洗劫一空，復將陳父兆惠用刀砍死，並將九歲男孩陳家玉帶去，六七兩日下午發生騙劫銀樓金器案，被搶的是二馬路鬧市合記老鳳祥，元記老鳳祥和老天寳三家，匪人白查行劫膽大已極，第八區綏靖司令部特於九日午刻，綁出夏間結夥行劫的兩名軍人，在蚌市南崗外執行槍決，一是黃斌，廣西陽朔人，一是謝森橋，廣西桂林人，過去都在供應局充當士兵，爲在蚱壽道上搶劫商店，同時伏法，當局頗有殺一儆百，以寒匪膽的意思</p>
<p>崩潰堪虞　市場倒風甚熾</p>
<p>天災人禍，交相迭乘，反映出來的是伏莽不蜻，治安堪憂，不景氣的洪流，似秋間黃汛般的向蚱市湧進，時値冬令，市塲所表現的是冷淡與孤寂，現在幾乎整個籠罩着崩潰的陰影，這裏的工商業，已走近崩潰的邊緣，甚至有的竟陷入崩潰的深洲，商店粉紛倒閉，可作爲蚌市不景氣的一種具體表徵。</p>
<p>按着慣例，銀根吃緊的現象，總發生在舊曆年邊，而這寒冬的開始，正是大家添購衣着，　積食品準備過冬的季節，可是大小商店雖是竭力招徠僱着西樂隊，大吹大擂，貼着大减價，大拍賣，剔莊六折，空前犧牲的市招，以吸引顧客，但顧問者終寥寥無幾，足徵市民購買力之减低，金融之極度呆滯。</p>
<p>倒風隨着寒風，幾乎襲擊整個的蚌埠市塲，它像旋風似的在各業中兜圈子，商店和各種的行號，因受不景氣影響，而被迫歇業或宣吿淸理的，幾乎日有所聞，根據市商會的調查，九月份倒閉三十三家，十月份倒閉十七家，十一月份又是三十二家，本月內相繼歇業的，又有二馬路的大新百貨公司和正平街的義記振業製革廠，年關在邇‘恐仍將有迫不得巳的行號，準備閉歇。</p>
<p>地下錢莊　暗中極形活躍</p>
<p>在這各業倒風熾烈的時候，祇有銀錢業尙能欣欣向榮，貼現生意特別地好，戰前本市銀錢業共有二十餘家，現在的銀行有中央，中國，交通，農民，上海，安徽，蚌埠市七家，銀號有裕民，信昌祥一家，錢莊有福誠，安利等九家。此外尙有秘密營業的地下錢莊，因爲客觀環境的需要，茁茂如雨後春笋，極形活躍，從事高利貼現或賒貸經營，實是蚌市高利貸的魔手。據中央銀行蚌埠分行經理余浩如吿訴記者，謂高利貸之形成，實緣於市面不景氣而產生，如說是高利貸造成市面不景氣，母寗說是高利貸因市場需要而興起，商人明知飲鴆止渴，原爲非計，其所以甘之如飴者，贊有其不得已之苦衷。地下鐵莊這兜放高利貸款，無疑是一種違法行爲，惟經營此等業務的，大多行動詭密，中央銀行固有取締和　止之權，然實不易查獲云。（十六日）</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕法第四共和國已正式產生，今後國民議會所通過之法律，須交參院審議，參院有權將議案發回衆院複議，但不能予以否決。參院定星期五選舉議長，長有當選希望者爲人民共和黨之特里勃，渠於一九二九年即任閣員之職，戰時爲反抗維希及德人之有力份子，聞社會黨亦擬支持特里勃爲參院議長。同時各政黨對總統之選舉，亦已在積極準備中，正式之候選人今尙未曾提出，但非正式之候選人則有前總理急進黨領袖赫里歐，衆院議長奧里沃等，赫里歐曾支持共黨意見，故深得共黨擁護。憲法規定總統係由參衆兩院議員在凡爾賽開會選舉，惟採用公開抑秘密投票方式，則憲洗並無規定。</p>

<h3>大霧中空前慘禍　三客機同夜失事　渝來中國公司兩機中一架在龍華墮毀　機師搭客廿九人幾全部罹難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市氣假異常惡劣，龍華機塲上空雨濃霧，障蔽地面，致昨日傍晚中國航空公司自渝來滬客機兩架，因無法降洛，分別墮毀機塲上及浦東華地，傷亡慘重，另有中央航空公司自京來滬客機一架，則設法在江灣機塲附近降落，情形尙佳。</p>
<p>昨晨九時許，重慶方面中國航空公司客機兩架起　來滬。一架係C-47型第一四〇號機，由美籍機師格林華特（Greenwood），副機師劉君（L．S．Liu）無綫電員金君（K．King）等航駛，自渝珊瑚壩戰場起飛。一架係C-46型第一一五號客機，由美籍機師　勞斯（Prdus），副飛機師譚君（H．C．Tan），無電員王君（S．T．wang）航駛，由渝白市　起飛。</p>
<p>午後一時左右，再機先後過漢口停　，逐又續飛來滬。過南京時，因京市氣候亦惡劣異常，因此並未降落，逕行直飛上海。</p>
<p>第一四〇號機首先於五時左右飛抵滬市上空，因濃霧瀰沒，無法降落。雖曾迭次與機塲上無綫電指揮塔聯絡，報吿不能判明跑道方向等情，終無着陸之法。是以第一四〇號機翱翔上空計有二一一一小時。至七時五十五分，該機適在機塲上空，汽油吿罄，遂即失去飛翔能力，機首突向下傾，即向地面直衝。初聞機聲憂戛，經聞尖銳破耳之聲劃破夜空，向地面衝來，轉瞬間，碰然一聲，該機即墮毀機塲上，當時曾略起火　是時機場上人員，正在急籌援救辦法，並早經召到消防處消防車二輛，救護車二輛，先已到場等候。此時即趕往墮毀處急救。</p>
<p>本報記者於該機失事後十分鐘內即已獲得消息，立刻趕往龍華機場勘查。見該機墮毀於南北方向大跑道旁側約十餘碼處，南距南黃浦江僅二三百碼。該客機尾部朝西北，從機腹中部機門五呎以上以至機首一段，業已整個粉碎。機翼飛　於十餘碼處，與機體分離。機尾翹起，亦已殘破，想見衝擊之猛烈。在此失事地點附近十餘間門面之範圍內，盡係從機中拋出之死亡男女旅客及殘破衣物等件。記者藉電筒徵光，會目睹離機門五呎之地上，有一二十餘歲女屍，服飾麗都，　屈橫倒於　泥中。</p>
<p>後經查明該機乘客共二十六人。當塲跌斃者十三人。餘十三人（男九，女四）經急送中山醫院，其中六名死於車上。實際由醫院急治者僅七人。記者曾轉赴醫院探問，據醫師吿記者稱：經動手術後，確悉二名已入　留狀態，四名生死未卜，僅一名大致尙可有生存之望。上述諸人中有四名係女性，一死一危，二名生死未卜。此項死傷旅客名單，迄屬稿時，公司方面猶在向渝探詢，未能明悉。據記者探視此唯一受侮較輕者，見其面部極度腫傷，紥有紗布，口中　語喃喃，所言多未足　信。</p>
<p>又悉正機師顯　破裂而死，副機師則腸腹洞穿無救．僅無錢雷負金君送於醫院。</p>
<p>第二客機接踵墮毀</p>
<p>當第一四〇號機出事時，第一一五號仍廻翔天際，亦正無法降落記者馳車抵機場大門，曾見此機陡然自南而北，劃過天空，距地不過二百餘呎。此時爲九時十分許，自此以後，機塲方面即不復聞得其音訊。　中國航空公司人員後得報吿，知該一一五號機亦已於九時卅分墮毀浦東方面。乃即派員四出尋覓，美海軍及水上警察分局亦派船隻協助搜索。唯迄午夜猶未能覓得其殘骸。</p>
<p>據記者向南黃浦江岸旁守衛兵及上海水泥廠司閽探明，彼輩會見此機自東北低飛衝向西南，後曾聞隆然一響，但未見有火起，大政方位在浦東泰山水泥廠以南的五六里處。</p>
<p>中央公司機亦被迫</p>

<h3>駐滬美兩大巡洋艦　招待孤苦兒童　擯棄樂園門外的難童　享受了半日天堂生活</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕聖誕節過了。　儘管聖誕大菜賣十萬元一客，舞廳除茶資漲到三萬元一杯外，另外再敲你一票入塲券的竹槓。但是娛樂塲所還是家家客滿。多少的天之驕子，曾經在道快樂的季節裏，嚼火鷄，呷香檳酒，盡興享受，狂歡達旦！</p>
<p>同樣是耶誕前夕，同樣是在上海，也許就在舞廳的門前，咖啡館的牆脚下，那些被遺忘了的可憐蟲，在忍受飢寒的交煎，正用着他們最後的一口氣，在生命綫上掙扎！</p>
<p>自然，道　暖房中的天之驕子是不層知道的，誰願意在這佳節良辰，讓那些破破爛爛的呌化來煞風量呢？</p>
<p>殷勤招待共度佳工</p>
<p>感謝中國友人的溫情，他們在過度的喜悅中，尙不忘記生活在苦難中的中國孩童，泊於黃浦江邊的兩大巡洋艦，洛杉磯號與哈林娜號，特在聖誕節，招待本市漕河涇難民難童收容所中的苦兒二百人及俄藉難童數十人，共度佳節。使那羣曾經流浪街頭，被擯棄於樂園門外的難童，享受了半日天堂的生活。</p>
<p>美國海軍的招待，非常週到。中午十二時正，二艘巨型登陸艇已經停候在灘邊。他們把孩子一個個扶入艇裏，接上巡洋艦，先餐以慧的西菜，然後領着他們到處參觀，在大　中放映電影，最後還喬裝了聖誕老人分送大批禮品……</p>
<p>慧西菜糖果禮品</p>
<p>這一天，在於那羣難童是不平凡的，登陸艇，巡洋艦，途白塔的土司，SW咖啡，上好西菜，華脫狄斯耐的卡通電影，穿大紅袍子的聖誕老公公，　統裏的糖果和玩具，……一切都是空前的，一切都將永速地成爲平生的奇　！</p>
<p>當孩子們用顫抖的手，拿起從未接觸過的刀又，取食豐美的西</p>
<p>，我不知道他們作何意想？難民難童收容所的所長周祖望吿訴我，他正惦念着那些留在所中的難童在做些什麼？原來這二百個孩子是抽籤抽中的幸運兒。還有一千多個難童留在所裏吃「行　」配給的黑麵粉過聖誕節。同時，他還在想，那些在牧容所以　的成千成萬露宿街道，喝西北風過日子的乞丐如何過過聖誕節？</p>
<p>聖誕老人何日再來</p>
<p>洛杉磯艦長伏奇里，和哈林娜艦長白魯，對於這羣難童的懂禮貌，守秩序，非常感動，除了殷勤招待之後，還親自登甲板揮手歡送。</p>
<p>傍晚四時，在迷濛的細雨中，孩子們辭別巨型巡洋艦。當登　艇載着他們橫渡黃浦江時，我相信每一個滿載而歸的孩子都要問，「聖誕老人幾時再來」？　雅可以給他們一個確切的回答呢？</p>

<h3>聖誕節花絮　日歷畫片生意佳　舞場茶資加數倍</h3>
<p>聖誕節高潮已過，有錢的人　着爲籌備過新年忙，再過半個月又將爲過舊歷新年忙，忙來忙去，爲的是過年過節，忙着過窮日子的人，正愁沒有下鍋米，那還管它是年是節。</p>
<p>文化街上，應時貨品，　日曆，賀年片和畫片生意最佳，美國新到賀年片，精緻美觀，起碼價是一千元，最高到三千元，購者踴躍。畫片生意，以鄰近上海之批發戶購者最多。畫片中仍多以封神榜，西遊記，劉關張拜弟兄爲背景，綴新式的有原子彈戰爭圖。美女出浴圖，允能引人，爲之止步。</p>
<p>昨日各馬路要口，有人散發天安堂慶祝聖誕籌備會印的傳單，上爲：「今日的人心，充滿着黃金慾。領袖慾，鼓動着　手，掀風起浪，運用着腦筋，翻雲覆雨，口唱的是和平，計劃的是戰爭。飽的飽，餓的餓，這樣不均的局面，我們基督徒，有一個報吿：今天是</p>
<p>耶穌聖誕，來信仰這位代人贖罪，建立天國的救世主，得以革除私慾，新生愛心，進入永生，否則同歸於盡，不信此說，試想上文，規在惟一轉機，來信耶穌，因他是愛，今人所缺的是愛。」</p>
<p>兩日來各舞塲茶資加高五六倍不止，看樣子不過陰歷年不會恢復原價。以漲價來紀念年節，最足表示海上的繁華。</p>

<h3>探監記　五百餘名漢奸　最近生活狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在傳說限期檢舉漢奸聲中，讓我們來看看現　押在上海監獄已決未決五百餘各漢奸的生活狀况：</p>
<p>衣：按照監獄規定，無論已決犯和未決犯，都需一律穿着囚衣。但因爲勝利後監獄驟然「光臨」這許多「貴客」，囚衣不够分配，未決犯遂特准穿家常衣服。所以上法庭受審時，仍多西裝革履，長袍裝束，每星期家　並可送換衣服。</p>
<p>食：每人每日囚糧二十兩米，分作兩餐，因爲人多，所以分批輸琉進食，上午八點到十一點，下午兩點到四點，白飯上加有蔬菜，獄中稱爲「蓋交飯」，但一般「富奸」，自有家屬每星期送來的罐頭食品和新鮮水菓代替「蓋交飯」，亦就　之不顧了。</p>
<p>住：忠監是一幢五層的水泥建築，共有監房三百七十四間，因爲屋多人少，所以有的一人一間，有的兩人合住，最多每間不超過三人。除老弱者外，一概不准架設床舖，那些過去睡慣「席夢思」沙發床的「顯宦」們，如今亦祇得　　席地而臥的滋味了。</p>
<p>行：囚居在鐵柵小室裏的人犯，對於每天能跨出囚房走動走動，認爲是無上享受，稱之爲「解放」。獄中規定上午七時開封，讓他們在走廊或天井內散散步，或和患難朋友聊聊天，待到十一時收封，重復被鎖入囚房。這樣到下午一點半開封，四時再收封。</p>
<p>忠監裏的「寓公」，便在道樣的生活方式下，消磨着一天天的光陰。外來的書報不准閱讀，但有許多消息，他們亦都知道。待等確定判決，便移住孝監，道時必須換穿囚衣，每兩星期可接見家屬一次，亦必須作工。好在監獄內的工塲設備很好，有印刷，製罐，成衣等等，依照工作成績、，每月亦可有點收入。到這時「部長」。「省長」，販夫走卒，特任官或盜賊，大家混在一起，亦不分什麼「階級」了。</p>
<p>監獄裏的醫院設備很好，患精神病的人，特闢有橡皮室。感化院則備有樂器，以供陶冶心情。忠監「寓公」不乏文人雅士，所以過去曾有書畫俱樂部的組織，閒來賦詩作畫，互相揣摩。聞蘭亭蔡培等閑時念佛講經，袁履登沈嗣良等則在每星期日會同基督徒做禮拜，鐵窗歲月，囹圄生活，這是在表示懺侮，還是冀求精神上的解脫？</p>
<h3>沈嗣良案傅訊四證人　名名有利　約大學生擁集高院旁聽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前聖約翰大學校長沈嗣良，被控充任僞職，經高檢處以漢奸嫌疑罪起訴一案，曾於上月十五日初審，昨日下午在高院刑二庭傳訊倪葆春·楊寬麟·黃嘉德·張素民四證人，未傳訊被吿，昨日聖約翰大學敎授同學到庭旁聽者甚衆，外籍敎授亦到數人，詢問歷一時餘始畢，茲將證人陳述各點分誌於后：</p>
<p>倪葆春</p>
<p>聖約翰大學敎授期，渠與沈嗣良均兼任醫師委員會委員，該會任務爲將醫師及醫藥器材，設法運送後方，以供開關滇緬路時之用，幷與軍事委員會西南運　處在香港訂有合同，共送至後方二十多個醫生，一百多個助手，渠離開上海赴昆明後，該會總幹事即由沈嗣良繼任，直至太平洋戰事發生，交通斷絕而後止，幷呈上該會與西南連輸處簽訂合同原本一件。</p>
<p>楊寬麟</p>
<p>該校土木工程學院院長，渠稱：被告之出任偽職，係完全敷衍敵僞，其目的純粹維持學校，因日人對於聖約翰校產，　思沒收，故不得不虛與委蛇，對於庭上詢問該校聘任日　顧問坂本義孝，田川大吉兩人一事，渠稱：幷非顧問，係兩日籍教授，擔任經濟及歷史課程，對於學校行政從不過問。</p>
<p>黃嘉德</p>
<p>該校文理學院副院長，渠稱：沈嗣良之任聖約翰大學校長，係由於該校校黃會之委派，被吿各種僞職，多數未經同意，即由敵僞報紙發表，因敵　報紙，對於新聞報道方面，常有不確實之消息發表，并以渠個人爲例，此次大公報發表飛機在長興失事，渠亦殘命，實際幷無其事，且聖約翰大學在當時敵僞心目中，以爲歷史悠久，故凡遏有敎育文化團體，均强派一份，不管同意與吾，在當時敵僞壓力下，除聖約翰關門外，實無其他方法拒絕，至於敵　管理委員，乃爲保管聖約翰大學校產，其他各種僞職，除偽上海市諮詢委員外，均稱不甚淸楚。另傳一在押之</p>
<p>張素民</p>
<p>作證，張係偽財政部　務署長，兼偽　　產業管理事務處處長，渠稱：該處全係由國人組織而成，由日人將所謂敵僞產業撥交該處分配，渠因沈嗣良原係該校校長，即交渠保管，目的即在保護英美敎會產業，沈嗣良在該處幷無任何名義，接收時亦未舉行儀式。末由</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕償還戰前存款涉訟第一件，陳季琳控吿四行儲蓄會案，經地院判決依一千倍增加給付，四行儲蓄會不服向高院上訴，昨日開庭，上訴人代理律師辯論二點：（一）法幣貶値確爲專實，即去年至今年一年中物價已漲數百倍，如因法幣貶値而必欲增加給付，則社會金融將不堪設想。（二）銀行地產升値，未淸算前不能知其確否獲得實益，妄自估價，徒作猜測，法律上毫無根據。庭上以該案案情已明，宣吿辯論終結，定期宣判。</p>

<p>辯護律師</p>
<p>洪士　起立稱：被告保護學校乃爲其使命，勝利前四個月，日人猶想獲取該狡產業，被吿如有心與敵僞勾結，該校校產決不致保護如此完整，對於被吿會出席僞敎育行政會議一節，辯護人曾函詢該校董事長顏事變，據函復：當時該校不奴化，不立案，維持原狀，至爲困難，如再不參加該僞敎育行政會議，則學校有被封閉危險，故被吿係奉命參加，當即呈上證明函一件，繼由辯護律師宓錫通起立，呈上該校畢業生兩兩件，係函謝被吿於敵僞時期資助渠等求學者，幷稱：當上海淪陷時，招募人才，送赴後方工作，頗爲危險云。</p>

<p>各地參議會，以清查團工作限期短促，民難伸，均擬請用延長以澄弊端，而慰民望，逐粉請中央核辦，旋奉主席電開：「關於淸查團結束後，其有未完工作，已託由各區監察使署繼辦，惟此後各地人民或民意機關，如續有發現接收弊端，仍可據實向監察署吿發，並可協助其進行。」現靑烏市參議會爲協助繼續淸查以　弊端計，已特組織淸查接收委員會，以期肅淸貪汚而伸正氣，並請本市參議會一致辦理。茲悉：市參議會業已將此項建議交召集人聯席會議核辦云。</p>

<p>上海冬令救濟委員會宣傳委員會，廿四日下午三時在愛棠路市黨部舉行第一次會議，主任委員方治，因公赴京，由市黨部書記長謝仁釗，代理主席，首由主席報吿，略謂：冬令救濟委會成立後，救濟工作，已積極　　，宣傳會任務，爲推動有關冬令救濟之宣傳工作，今日召開萬次會議係商討擴大宣傳計劃云。</p>
<p>經費尚須繼續籌募</p>
<p>旋由冬令救濟委會總幹事何德奎報告該會成立後工作概况，略謂：救濟委會庇寒所已設立，地址在通州路預定救濟之難民目標四千人，現已收容七百餘人，今明兩日可繼續收容四百餘人，救濟經費預定爲十萬萬元，除由市府撥款四萬萬元，原定請社會部撥助二萬萬，餘四萬萬田勸募委員會負責籌募。嗣以社會部僅撥到六千萬元，故須請勸募委會籌募五萬四千萬元，始能達到預定目標。迄目前止，募得之款項，僅一萬五千餘萬元（廣播勸募六千五百餘萬元，勸募委會主委杜月笙發動各區民代表會籌募八千五百餘萬元）尚差三萬八千餘萬元，須機績籌募。勸募委會定於下月六日至十一日，假逸團飯店舉行餐會，門劵收入，可望獲得二萬萬元，至於救濟工作，除設立庇寒所外，並將舉辦施米施粥，及救濟隊貧等事宜，同時皖北近有難民二千餘人流亡來滬，由本會商請行總滬分署各送緬粉一包，交由安徽旅滬同鄉會分發，並請該會遣送回鄕。同時本市抗戰　難同志中貧寒失業者以及殉難烈士家屬，本會亦讓決贈送麵粉，略資救濟云云。</p>

<h3>社局趙處長談年賞問題　各業盈虧情形互異　援例要求殊不合理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局趙班斧處長接見本報記者，答覆各項有關年賞之問題，綜合要點如下：（一）本市六大公用事業年賞，已決定爲一個月，勞力接受無問題。（二）絲　業之年賞問題，　涉廠家四十，工人一萬以上。勞方最初要求年賞兩月，資方根本不願考慮，經勞工處努力後，勞方讓步至二十八日，資方讓步至六日。因絲綱業各廠之盈　情形不同，趙氏建議有盈餘者裱助虧損者，使能負担最低限度之合理年賞。此事正繼續綢處中。（三）有盈餘之事業，如自願發一月以上之年賞，而無勞資糾紛時，社會局可以不管。趙氏認爲各業盈虧情形迥不相同，援例要求爲不合理之事，對於雙俸之辦法，認爲頗合理。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）輕信讒言</p>
<p>美夢樁問　鄱人十八歲時，因不耐繼母苛待，離家自立。後因懷家心切，重入庭闈，不意繼母故態復萌，不能安居，故於最近再度出走，家父生性懦弱，輕信婦言，申稱將登報脫離父子關係，鄙人外出，事前雖未商得家長同意，但事後曾致函家長，以表歉意，申述理由，毫未謗誹家署，況出走時所帶均係私人物件，並未將家中任何一物携出。請問是項聲明是否有效？慼如何對付？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕父子關係係屬直系血統，依法不得脫離。如有登報脫離父子關係者，依法當然無效。</p>
<p>（二）分析遺產</p>
<p>吳懋問　（一）某甲娶妻乙生十Ａ，乙死後繼娶丙生子Ｂ今AB二子皆已成年，甲亦死矣，丙是否爲甲這法定代理人，及AB之法定保護人？（二）丙是否有全權單獨繼承或處理甲之遺產？（三）分析遣產時，丙及AB可否將遺產作三份分派。丙亡故後，遺產是否由B繼承？A有權利過問否？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）甲已死亡，其繼室丙不能爲甲之法定代理人。甲前妻乙所生之子Ａ，及繼室所生之子Ｂ，旣均已成年，亦無須丙爲法定代理人。或監護人，（來函所稱法定保護人，想係監護人之意）。（二）丙不能全探單獨繼承或處理甲之全部遣產。（三）甲之遺產。應分三份分派，丙AB各分一份，丙與其子B所得之財產如何處置，與A無涉。</p>
<h3>探訪行踪</h3>
<p>尋訪陸昌會　堂弟陸昌曾一名長珍，二一歲，嘉定南翔人，八一三後隨國軍西撤，駐居於湘省衡陽邵陽一帶，自卅二年十一月來信後，迄今音訊杳然，全面勝利，亦逾一載，仍不見歸，年邁老母，念子之心，無時或釋，如有知其下落者，祈請函知上海泰興路七二弄六號，則感德無涯。陸昌藩敬啓。</p>

<h3>金融市場波濤險惡　新設行莊首富其衝</h3>
<p>央行當局發表感想</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來金融市塲，疊起彼動，其中尤以黃金一項，暴漲特甚。惟　日經央行一再拋售鎭！市價終吿不支下瀉，昨日再度劇跌。一般投機取巧份子，首受打擊。影響所及，若干新設之銀行錢莊，頭寸遂驟然吿緊。其中尤以放帳較　，或往來客戶較　者，驟經打撃，即發生不　現象。昨日傳聞中者共達六家之多，事後紛謀彌補，或另加改組。記者爲特趨訪央行稽核處副處長高岳生氏，叩以央行當局，對此事之觀感。　談：本市金融業之業務經營，向由財政部錢幣司直接　導。央行當局，對金融業中若千行莊，發生不穩現象，當亦備極關注。惟查若千新　行莊，大多係內地分號。蓋財部條例，本有規定，若內地行莊，設立已逾四年，且業務經營穩健者，得在他處設立分號。現查內地行莊，符合該條例之規定者，數不在少。故最近滬市乃有大批新行莊出現。查該批行莊，常多資金不甚充足。往往一筆開辦費，已將　所有資金，而猶須負債若干，　該批行莊，又多外行人氏經營者。對銀行業務經營，全乏統盤籌劃。再以本市行莊，平素爲調劑本身頭寸盈虛，常賴同業拆放。一且金融市塲波動，各行莊無不收縮頭寸，以維自身實力。平日依賴同業拆放之行莊，驟然失所憑藉，難免不發生動搖現象。又查目前行莊存款，十九皆屬活期存款，極富於神經質及游離性。市塲波動時，該項存款即成游資，流入市塲　　黃余美鈔。故資歷較淺之行莊，通常依該項活期存款爲頭寸之調撥者，至此即易遭擱淺。最　著之例證，即過去各行　　在票據交換所頭寸偶有不足，而須待彌補者，每日不過數千萬元。茲者差額達二三億元者，已數見不鮮。故渠甚望金融界經過此番波動後，更應以穩健方策，爲今後經營業務之職志云。</p>
<p>又訊，際此年關迫近之時，復遭遇黃金風潮，一般投機者流，推波助瀾，獲暴利者固有，但以把舵失穩，被轉進漩渦而傾覆者，亦復不少，如成大銀號停止交換後昨日復有順利銀號宜吿淸理，此外尙有五家新興銀行以頭寸週轉不靈，昨日頓呈緊張現象，市塲對以上各銀行擱淺之情形，更屬傳說紛紜，因此各　重之行莊，對於頭寸調度，均抱審愼態度，兼之中央銀行連日來大量拋售黃金，吸收頭寸，近千億元，市面銀根頓吿緊縮，暗息已提高爲二角，但仍難借得現款，故一般預料在銀根奇緊之情形下，黃金價格勢難看好，其他物價亦將逐漸回平云。</p>
<h3>拆息高至三角以上　金鈔市價繼續慘跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨受金融界普　　　，繼續慘跌，晨開三四〇萬有求，開後曾微升至三四三萬，不久銀錢　之缺單者紛來求售，跌風又起，而確三四〇萬關，十時後央行以三三六萬之價，配給四十條，此後人心更爲恐慌，不穩消息頻傳，再破呂一三三〇萬大關，某銀行倒閉之訊，賣風更如火上加油，漫無止境，午刻更跌至三一五萬以下，而後稍穩，午後現交曾有削價求現者，見三〇八萬低價，隔日交割開出自三一七，逐步升至三二九萬，最後仍被壓低至三二〇萬左右，結果較前收再跌二十三萬，飾金卅四萬五，銀元亦降，暗拆普通在二角光景，當日頭寸者，竟扳高至三角以上。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦被動帶小美鈔晨開六七〇〇元又售，即隨金價回落，午刻降低至六二〇〇元以下，午後稍吿平穩，在六二〇〇元至六四〇〇之間徘徊，結果較前收又跌四〇〇元，港票　爲呆滯，自一三五〇元起盤低至一二五元以下，結果亦跌一二〇元，港匯因港市耶誕休似，經營者僅肯以一三〇〇元之供給，印匯一四八〇元，英匯二〇八〇〇元，均屬賣價，並無成交做開。</p>
<h3>公債平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨尙　支持，雜牌稍痰，統丙晨開一三九〇元，三六〇室來售，曾低至一三三〇元，後以五五二室有補，乃回高至一四六〇元，而後轉　，結果較前收計甲乙丙各升三十元，統丁跌五十元，統戊則跌一〇〇元，成交的三百萬元。</p>
<h3>證券號五家　非法交易　經查出勒令停業</h3>
<p>社會局對於證交塲外不法交易，在積極取締中，茲悉：社局據證交監理官函謂，本市　來，萃豐，炳記，一二泰，新華，泰豐等證券號，及　誠紗號，非法塲外交易，請　取締，當即派員會同警察局前往調查，並檢查脹册及交易情形，經查出泰豐，萃　，炳記，三泰，新華等號，確有非法交易行爲，昨已勒令各該號停業，同時通知公用局，拆除該號等電話，並囑各證券號至社會局具結，以後不再非法交易，至寳誠紗號，經查明並無不法交易情形，僅由社局　其具　云？</p>
<h3>紗價續跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因黃金疾降，客幫吸胃薄弱，業中人供求踴躍，加以製品工廠之配給紗貶價求售，是以二十支又跌五六萬，雙股綫問津乏人，更見疲滯，竟跌七八萬云。</p>
<p>二期南運月杪結束</p>
<p>據悉：第二期南　紗布，自本月份開始辦理登記，截至廿四日上午止核准　請廠商，的有四十家左右，計棉紗三千八百五十七件，布四萬九千四百八十八疋，至本期紡管會批准南運紗布總額，棉紗爲五千八百另一件，棉布爲十二萬五千四百九十二疋，聞本期各廠商聲請南運紗布，該會准於本月杪結束，如屆期本期批准南運紗布總額尙有餘額時，當　併於第三期辦理。</p>
<p>四期配紗價格不變</p>
<p>第四期第四次配給復制品業棉紗價格，紡織廠有調整之意，唯紡管會並未經審定，是以配價仍須維持舊價，本得變更。</p>
<p>廿支雙股恢復掛牌</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，以廿支雙支杪綫爲　帆業主要原料，自聯合配紗以來，該項紗綫，均未開配，茲以恢復掛脾，特予列入，其價格依照廿支單紗增加百分之十二·五，每件一九六萬五千元，並自本月二十日起開始，業已通知複製品棉紗配銷會轉知各同業。</p>
<h3>人造絲　第四次配給　申請者寥寥</h3>
<p>染織業同業公會前以各同業需要人造絲摻夾　繼成品，經向中信局申請核配，經該局核准後，受配各戶，每戶發給申請卡一紙，按月配發四次，每次繳款申請手續，均由該會轉接辦理，茲悉：本月第四次業定於廿七日開售，各同業繳款日期，統限於廿六日巾午截止，如　期不繳者，作爲自願放棄論，現各同業登記卡巳送到會者，計有新華公等十九家，未送到者，尙有四六家，該會巳通知各同業知照，又據該公司負責人稱：年關將屆，同業資金週轉不靈，故未送者，恐多係無力繳款。</p>
<h3>台糖疾退</h3>
<p>昨臺糖因開始可以提貨，現貨頓增，價乃急遽下降，公會劃盤中砂白現貨降至十三萬八九千元，棧單十三萬五六千元，生砂赤十三萬元至十二萬九千元，棧單十月萬六七千元，現貨均跌二萬元以上，廣帮之　　靑亦降萬元，以十二萬三千元至十一萬八千元，開二百餘包，汕帮提莊靑十二萬五千元，成交數十包。</p>

<p>華股昨恐怖氣氛加重，市況更無維持，慘跌不已，晨初開出已低，開後一九九號二一五號一四二號一二二號六一號　袂售出，遞永紗乃降低至六二五元以內，迨後金市小定，七六號二二四號一四五號四號一五四號四七號咸進，曾回好至六五七元，十時一刻後，金市復疲，八九號八三號八五號二二九號九九號六一號咸售，二三二號一九八號中途有納而多盤，無奈金價一再下降，某銀行虧損十億元而吿倒閉，二二九號二三三號八三號一五四號冉售，九九號二八號猛拋現　紗，終於破六〇〇元關，現勤興首吿跌停，信　景綸美亞亦相繼吿跌至限度，人心更怯，金市助　，近午遞永紗曾見五八五元低價，經一四號四七號來進，午收　穩，較前收計永紗景　新光華一體各跌一成左右，美亞信和勤興跌成半，遞交永紗景福跌一成，美亞華　跌半成强，信和新光跌一成半，冷股開做者不多，景綸獨跌成半，午後上塲即因金價慘降至三一〇萬內，一八六號二一五號均售遞永紗，降至五七五元，一二四號二一二號來進，金市見昂，而回升至六一〇元外，二一八號二一五號均售，雖有回低，但因一七七號二二四號一六九號　解，再升至六一六元，無何金市回降，一四五號八九號二二九號九九號一六號一七一　號陸續脫售，現永紗再退至五八〇元光景，七六號臨收有納，低後稍穩，結果較前收計永紗信和跌一成强，美亞景　勤興新光各跌一成半，華　跌半成强，冷股成交寥寂，有成交者絕少，　安跌二成弱，景綸小成半弱，大通微升，餘者　挫，遞交永紗跌一成，華轉降半成强，餘者均跌一成半弱，塲外各股稍有回跌。</p>

<h3>原料最多只能維持一月　繅絲業將全部停工　盼政府貸款貼補速謀救濟</h3>
<p>繅絲業公會理事長褚輔成昨日接見記者稱：（一）該會所　江浙皖三省京滬二市各會員本有一百五十餘家，然目前正式開工者尙不足五十家，且開工各廠之原料最多祇能維持一月，在陰曆年底前後行將全部停工，以待明年五月閒新繭上市，始能開工，此係目前　織業主要之威脅。（二）此次赴　　願，曾得蔣主席之面允，除目前作一般之救濟外，並擬於明年度政府預算中列入繅絲業貼補費一項，因蠶絲出口對政府外匯及蠶農之生活關係甚大，目前我國　絲在美國市塲因與低廉日貨競銷，每担的須虧蝕三分之一，故政府如不加貼補，整個繅絲業均將陷於崩潰。（三）目前政府對繅絲業救濟，已由行政院令中　公司與中央銀行協商提高收購秋絲價格，目前尙未有最後決定，每担的在六萬元左右。中蠶公司已將最後一批秋繭全部撥給各廠代繅，以維工人生活。至貸款問題，除已成立繅工貸款，按每擔一百四十萬元貸給外，機械　　備之貸款，按每，繅絲車作抵，貸款二百萬元，則尙在協商中。（四）繅絲業之盛衰，對整個國民經濟關係至大，故深盼政府能從改良蠶種繭質，及協助各絲廠大量添購最新式之機械設備入手，因日　三百斤可繅絲一担，而中國之土繭須六百斤始能繅絲一担，同時機械設備澈底改善後，不僅可增加縱絲量及改　絲質，同時更可减低　絲之成本，如此始能在國際市塲與日絲作競爭，也祇能如此，始可稱澈底改善整個之繅絲業。</p>
<h3>茶商擬再請願　要求政府收茶</h3>
<p>本市茶商因鑑於年關在即，政府收購茶葉辦法迄未見公佈實行，爰於目前第議討論，緊急朮救辦法，一致決定再度遺派代表晋請願，代表廿一人，全國各茶區均派有人員參加，由前中茶公司總經理　景　主其事，聞連日各方正分頭討論晋京日期，再據半官方消息中央信託局對於收購茶葉原則業經確定，暫以綠茶着手，其中屯綠佔百分之七十，平水綠茶佔百分之卅，現正在硏討收購茶葉標準云。</p>
<h3>進口業之厄運　前訂外貨不及限期進口　要求輸管會通融辦理</h3>
<p>本市進出口商業回　公會，自進口貿易暫行辦法　　後，各同業所訂外貨，由於事先無充分準備，事後更無法補救，故對於上月十七日修正辦法公佈以前訂購之貨物，輸管會通知各行商，統限於明年二月底以前，一律裝運到埠一節，各行商聞訊之下，大起恐慌，，據該會秘書周經爲談稱：各同業前訂之貨，一部份堆積　國海岸碼頭，目前正候船裝運，尙有部份猶在美國各內地口岸，因美海員罷工時關甚長，所有海“碼頭，各國訂購之貨物堆積如山，倉棧均告無法容　，海運現雖恢復，但該批物資，，如欲全部運完，仍非數月不辦，至未到海岸碼頭之物資”更無論已，現輸管會限於二月底以前，運到上海事實上多不可能，除繼續召集各同業開會商討外，並擬要求輸管會諒解商人痛苦，予以適當解決。</p>
<h3>印棉春季出口配額　增加一倍至二倍半</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿三日電〕，印度政府頃己明令核發毛頭在十六分之十一呎及以下棉花配額五〇〇·〇〇〇包之出口執照，以便在正月至四月期內輸出。各行商在一九四六年十二月止出口期間輸往各國，美國除外之出口執照，不論已領未領，將加發執照若干紙，其數量得爲本年十二月止核准之二·五倍。至轍美執照，將另外核發，其數量得與一九四六年止期內核准者相同。又正月至四　期內指撥　往聯合　國之配額，巳定爲一二五·〇〇〇包。上　五及　六紡細　管理局會　上，曾討論布匹亟須增產事，又各中心區，實際上可能採用三班制，亦曾昨加討論。</p>
<h3>華僑復業貸款　緬甸開始貸放　菲律賓與暹羅區尚在籌備中</h3>
<p>政府爲援助僑胞在海外復興商業所具辦之復業貸款，緬甸及菲律賓兩區，由交通銀行負責辦理，貸款總額各爲美金五百萬元。茲悉：緬甸貸款業已開始，菲律賓則尙在籌備，惟緬甸因太平洋戰爭期問之損失，迄今不復，社會尙未安定，故一般商業恢復尙須待以時日。貸款用度極少，現交行在仰光方面所貸出者，爲數甚微，大部均屬房地產抵押放款，至菲律賓方面，因貸款需我領事證明，目前尙在辦理手續，據交行消息，菲島貸款，菲分行儲款以待，隨時可行，惟據一般觀察，以此次貸款限額過小，信用貸款每戶限一千美金，抵押一萬　金，對大商家補益不多，同時菲島華僑比較　有，一般亦可憑信用向美訂貨，且向國外銀行借款，利息極低，預料將來貸出爲數不多，中國銀行辦理之　越區復業貸款二百五十萬美金，暹方該行已派員前往籌備，並就地於該國當局協商，並由外交途徑交涉，以謀打開暹外匯統制之障礙，越南　　因法越衝　，河內中行辦事處己遷西貢，須待局勢稍稍好轉，即行開始舉辦。</p>
<h3>國絲加工外銷　組織聯營公司</h3>
<p>資本五億卽將成立</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國絲加工外銷事日漸具體，本市絲織業決定組　聯合製銷公司，資金定爲五億元，各絲綢廠均可認股，國家銀行如欲投資，亦所歡迎。公司之籌備工作，希望能在舊勝年底前完成，將來擬派員赴海外各市塲直接取得聯　，不假手於洋行銷售。關於盈虧自行負責一節，幾經磋商，現已解決。各廠已同意自担風險，但虧損以「工價」之九成爲最大限度，而超過議定價格之銷售所得，亦即作爲各廠之利　。</p>
<h3>絲綢全面轉疲</h3>
<p>昨日絲綢市况類皆平疲，交易寥寥，人造絲一二〇號高山晨喊二十九萬至卅萬元有成交，東洋牌子做四十二萬元，下午無甚變化，比上日小去十四五萬元，半光終因缺貨價堅持，一五〇號有光反見高昂，金三馬小箱利生昌喊價五百萬元，六箱塲內喊四百七十萬元，廠絲皆　疲軟，B字等級五百十二萬五千元有成交，CD等級均無做開，開口貨高檔做四百八十五萬元，較上日俱小十餘萬元，綢貨亦因原料低回而呈疲軟，華巾縐喊七百五十元，　後只做七百元，餘無榮辱。</p>
<h3>五棓子缺貨</h3>
<p>據悉：此關五棓子，存貨甚缺，各出口行有向漢口直接採辦，運滬揀選後，再行裝運出口者，聞滬土產行商售與出口行，在上海交貨每大包價（即淨車一司馬担）每包爲十二萬元，惟　有　價，無成交。</p>
<h3>金榮再緊</h3>
<p>金針榮近似奧港　辦，價乃上　　覺緊秀，號貨遂亦跟升，昨市高貨開至卅一萬元，普通二十八萬元至二十四五萬元，以貨底本不充足，茲値冬銷增旺，趨勞因甚挺立云。</p>
<h3>華茶銷往法屬　接洽已有頭緒</h3>
<p>我國茶葉，向在歐美各國佔有相當地位，尤以銷往法屬非洲一帶爲最多，刻下國外對於華茶雖有　要，　彼　售價，尙未及我國生產成本，故外銷卒猶價　，本市茶商鑒於華茶已瀕絕境，數度向政府呼籲，要求救濟，或照成本收購，但迄今仍鮮具體展開，茲悉央行業務當局林鳳苞氏，關於我國茶葉之種種苦裏，曾與法國經　使節　商討數月，結果的有數百噸獲得　滿解決，聞大都係抽珍，珍眉等　　色，目前對茶樣已認爲合格，售價方面，較往者亦酌予提增，並又指定絡繹付裝法　各地，是以　來本市各出口行漸趨活動，惟行　依然　定，於至紅綠茶內銷仍無生氣。</p>
<h3>派貨絡繹　捲烟疲落</h3>
<p>捲烟　成派貨絡　，買戶觀望，市勢疲莫能與，昨日初市做開即軟，後即徐步下落，十支大英每箱再小十一萬元，其中僅廿支前門，泰山及三王稍見秀氣，其餘一致下挫云。</p>
<h3>港延期付款令　目前尚難取消　股票轉讓禁令　或可望局部廢除</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港廿四日電〕代理殖民地事務大臣杜德，在立法議會中答復某議員之質詢時稱：自香港克復以　頒布之延期付款令，政府並無即行取消之準備。渠稱：關於涎期　付令及債務人與債權人關係之問題，政府目前尙不能作進一步之聲明，殊爲　事。該項延期付款令雖無立即取消之希望，但關於取消日軍佔領期間地產交易之可能性，殖民地事務局已在硏究考慮中。杜　續稱：「關於股　　議禁令，可能子以部分廢除一節，亦已建　國務大巨採　施行，以便業主向主管機關登記之各公司股票准許自由　　，但有糾紛各公司股票當然不在此例。」多數商人之意見，認爲延期付款令多少足以阻滯香港之經濟復興，若干方面已敦促政府及早取消該項禁令。　在延期付款令下，所有股票交易必須先得財政大臣之核準，目關於賞還　務糾紛不能在法院中提　訴　。該延期付款令並未賦予銀行以解凍戰前帳目之權。當地股票交易所仍　續　　中，至少在該該禁令部分取消以前，絕少復業之可能。</p>
<h3>交易閑散　煤價</h3>

<h3>教部最近三年　邊疆教育工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕邊疆教育委員會，於三十三年一月間，在重慶舉行第四屆會議，三十四年，因勝利復員，致第五屆會議未及召開。此三年間，國步會一度進人最艱危之時代，敎都邊教設施，不能不順應局勢，艱苦撐持，徐謀發展。大抵在日寇投降以前政府爲策應盟車反攻，軍需孔急，邊敎事業，大受限制，如邊政學院蘭州語文訓練班等，均無法籌設。然邊疆敎育關係國防至鉅，敎部仍就人力財力之所及，黽勉從事，除海疆學校喇嘛職校及中央西北兩大學邊政系照常籌設外，並致力於原有學校素質之改善。迨勝利復員，邊敎事業益見艱鉅，後方區各邊校經費之維持，敎師生活之安頓，敎材設備之供應等，旣不容中斷，而收復區之復員工作，更須配合邊疆新形勢之發展，迅謀推進。現第六屆會議將於廿六日開幕，敎部已將三年來邊教設施，準備報吿於第六屆會議，大要如下：</p>
<p>直轄事業　（一）書科與中學：邊疆專科學校，除原設之邊疆學校外，三十三年敎部復應收復東南海疆之需要，成立海疆學校一所，近更應西康地方當局之請求，擬將原　於該省之康定師範，改爲師範專科學校，正呈院請示中。中學方面，除湟川河西兩中學一度改辦邊疆敎育外，現僅有伊盟中學一所。（二）師範敎育：邊地師範學校，原有師範學校十所，計設於設南者三，設於西康甘肅者各二，設於貴州青漲寗夏者各一，並於伊盟中學附設師範班。近應收復地區之需要，復於熟河，察哈爾，遼北，興化，各設師範學校一所。新疆境內之天山葱嶺師範，亦在進行籌備中。師範學校之學制，自三十四年度起稍有變軍，肄業年限一律改爲四年。（三）職業敎育：邊地職業學校，共有八所，，計設於靑海西康四川者各二，設於甘肅寗夏者各一。科系複難，大多因地制宜而設：有重畜牧者，有重農林者，有並重農牧者，有專重紡織者，並有醫事，獸醫，農產畜產製造等之設置，率按當地建設之需要爲準。就肆業年限言，有二年三年四年五年不等，此亦因地方特殊情形權爲酌定者。敎部爲確定邊地職業學校之學制起見，已規定邊地初級職校，悉改爲四年制，課程標準正着手擬訂中。（四）小學敎育：綏寗康藏等地所設小學，已達十七所，連師範附小合計，共爲三十四所。（五）社會敎育：敎部對邊地社會敎育，向由各校兼辦，每年由部酌撥收音機幻燈機等器材，令各校組織巡廻施敎朦劇團等，巡廻各邊地施敎，其他推廣事業如辦理民衆識字學校，開放診療所等，亦有若干學校頗著成績。</p>
<p>地方邊教　（一）後方區各設省；各省扒行邊教，咸有相當歷史，惟過去不免各自爲政，所表現者亦各有不同，敎部爲謀切合邊地需要起見，特訂定各邊省推進邊敎三年（卅三至卅五年）計劃，就小學，社敎職業各方面酌定標準，飭就經費人才可能範圍內，擬定實施計劃，呈准實施。計邊令訂定者，有川，鎭，甘，寗，康五省，至綏遠靑海二省，因情况特殊，只據擬定三十四年度計劃，貴州廣西兩省，據報已無另行實施邊敎必要，新疆則以全省敎育，幾全屬邊敎範圍，故祇擬訂敎育行政計劃。就實施結果而論，各邊省對於邊敎之設計與實施，大體尙稱努力，其中以川，滇，甘，康四省，因經費人才較爲充裕，成績亦較良好，靑，寗，新，綏等省才之。惟蒙旗地方敎育，因經費師資兩感困難，各旗所設小學，因陋就簡，有待改進者尙多，中等學校則均付闕如。敎部對各邊省，歷年均撥邊教補助費，以資鼓勵。計卅四年度補助甘，寗，靑，康，川，滇，新，綏，察，九省公私立學校經費，共爲二，二九四，〇〇〇元，本年增爲一三，九九〇，四〇〇元，直接撥給各校領用。（二）收復區各邊省；東北及熱察綏蒙旗地區，在敵僞侵佔期間曾大量設校實施奴化敎育，以　我邊胞。復員時，受戰事影響，接收遲遲，致該區敎育陷於停頓。敎部爲鼓勵地方設校並迅速完成復員工作起見，特訂頒　旗敎育緊急措施要點，通令施行，規定凡在收復區各　旗地方中小學及社敎機關，過去具有相當當視綫，今後教學無若何困難者，應由省或盟旗政府就人事經費許可範圍，設法恢復。經費方面，本部接次列規定，機給復員補助費：評高級中學補助三百萬元，初級中學補助二百萬元，完全小學補助一百萬元（社敎機關同），初級小學補助六十萬元。師資方面，應聘用合裕人員，或就原有師資施以短期特種訓練，分發各校任敎。此外如廣東海南島黎民敎育，台灣高山族敎育，亦巳由敎部分飭粵台爾省擬具計　推進中。</p>

<h3>台杯決賽開始</h3>
<p>美澳兩國勝負預測</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社墨爾缽廿四日電〕臺雜斯　杯決賽，定廿六日開始在此舉行，美澳兩國單打選手陣容已公怖，計廿六日單打兩組，勃朗雜區（澳）對許洛特（美），配爾斯（澳）對克拉茂（美），廿七日雙打一組，名單尚未宣怖，廿八日單打兩組，勃朗雜區對克拉茂，配爾斯對許洛特，澳洲球迷認爲美方以克許兩人出馬，實與澳洲有利。美國臺杯隊長不選派克與克拉茂合作，實爲失策，因派克會有臺杯決賽經騐，許洛特則爲新進人材。惟美方此種陣容，亦有生意在焉，因在最近　梨雜多利亞綱球賽中，許洛特會在半決賽中擊敗配爾斯，但在決賽中敗於勃朗雜區之手，如此許洛特在臺杯單打中可勝一組，克拉茂球　在許浼特之上，定可擊敗配爾斯　，果爾美國可勝兩組。克拉茂爲美國冠軍，勃朗雜區爲澳洲國手，兩入勢均力敵，克拉茂若獲勝，則五賽三勝，利亞賽，故成績不易評定。</p>

<h3>濟南廿四小時</h3>
<p>— 本報濟南特派員范麗天</p>
<p>廿日航訊</p>
<p>飛機在濟南着陸後，首先映入眼簾的是機塲四週的無數堅强工事和碉堡。機塲而積的四方公里，兩天以前，（時膠濟綫尙未正式通車）這還是濟南與外界聯絡的唯一交通運輸綫，先後嘗有六千多架飛機載運着各級大小文武戰鬥員，補給品，物質的或精神的，確保了它的安全，使道寬闊的五十公里八十萬人口的孤城，雖處共軍四面硬打軟吃下，仍能免遭浩刧，屹立無恙，而首當其衝祖負着此項最艱鉅任務的，便是王兼司令官佐民的左右手，現任緩區副官長趙子良將軍。</p>
<p>二將軍介謁　綏區李副司令官</p>
<p>趙將軍和吳戾天將軍都是記者的舊交。遠在八一三上海抗戰期間，我們就一見如故，成爲戰地最知己的朋友。這次他們知道記者米濟南，由於他們的熱誠招待，眞有「賓至如歸」，「他鄉遇故知」之感，使記者深深地體味到友情的溫暖和深厚。</p>
<p>趙吳兩將軍首先爲我介紹了綏區李副司令官仙洲，羅參謀長幸理及龍主任軸雲等高級負責人。李副司令官爲黃埔一期名將，「山東三李」（餘二爲李延年，李玉堂，）之一。高高的身材，圓圓的面孔，神釆奕奕，精神健旺，只是鬢髮已略見斑白，足見他在抗戰期間爲國辛勞。著名的山西忻口及安徽阜陽等役，均親身參與，不知爲抗戰史上寫下多麼光輝的篇章。</p>
<p>马副军长谈　黄埔逸事一大套</p>
<p>時巳近午，李等的記者用膳。席間，我們由共軍作亂山東的經過，談到「外戰外行，內戰內行」，更由在座關中，馬副軍長志超亦係一期老大哥，談到他最初投考黃埔時的趣聞軼事。他侃侃地同時也很坦率地叙述着：他當初因程度太差，感於投考无錄取把握，乃於考前先行晋謁校長，（即委座），瀝陳軍校與一般學校性質不同，對邊遠省份投考生應從寬錄取。委座從其請，乃於其報吿上批一、「准予破格錄取」俟臨考試时，恰由王柏齡先生任主考，王氏臨試前，首先宣佈約法三章，即：自認有木領的來考，無本領的自己退出去。絕對不准舞弊，錄取標準根據成績。人情關說，概作無效。當時自動退出考塲放棄考試的，竟達十餘人。當時馬氏絲毫不爲所動，及考至數理化時，馬氏迎一個題目都答不出，繳了白卷，深恐名落孫山，乃不得不上書王柏齡，瀝訴苦情後，並繼之以恫嚇：「苟不錄取，只有拼命」。王氏膽小，結果果然取了！</p>
<p>大砲王柏龄　嚇得人心驚內跳</p>
<p>馬言至此，猶不勝　往之情。李副司令官當爲補充　：「王柏齡素有王大砲之稱，但雖謂大砲，其膽最小。王氏嘗語人：「人家呌我大砲，我確是個大砲」，但我這個大砲，只要聽到大砲一響，我就心驚肉跳了！」　座爲之鬨然。</p>
<p>馬氏擅詞令，性詼諧，他又談及他十七年任團長時與同期同學陳德法同去謁見委座，委座請他們吃過飯後，馬氏深恐逗留過久，或有缺點，易爲委座發覺，當即請示於委座，對渠等帶兵作戰有何指示？委座略一思索，即順上吿曰：「你們兩位帶兵，只是陳德法一人的名字，就是不「得」法』。馬氏辭出後，大大的抱怨陳德法，不是他的名字，委座或許也想不到這個「考語」。陳氏現担任迪化警備司令，可謂已經「得法」了。</p>
<p>飯後，李副司令官等忙着開會，記者就邀由山東公報吳副社長等陪同訪問了此間六家日報，六家通訊社和六家期刊，這裏的通訊社，除中央社外，如春秋社等，亦皆能按日發稿，使報館外勤，大有「無法競爭」之勢。報紙的銷數自三千至萬餘份，在形如圍城中的濟南，一切物質條件皆感缺乏的情形下，　正象微着新聞同業的苦鬥精神。</p>
<p>王主席勤政　每日只睡四小時</p>
<p>下午五時，王兼主席佐民邀宴。王氏自兼任省府主席後，事務繁忙，以致每日只能睡眠四小時，而在此謹有的四小時中，猶不時被電話機所攪擾。我們一別六年，第一個感覺就是王氏雖宵旺勤勞，在一身而繫山東之安危的艱鉅任務下，仍雙目烱烱，體魄健壯，一如往昔，足見立殊勳成大業的先決條件，不僅是知仁勇兼全，而拙壯的體力，尤爲其先決條件中之條件。王兼主席今天雖已由國家寄以重任，但其待人之誠實懇摯，處事之認眞不苟。在工作中力求進步的傳統傷風，初不因位高而稍有變易。在席間，王主席嘗提到，我們最初相識時，他還只是一個師長，但十年來的記者還只是一個記者，相形之下，能不汗慚？然王主席仍一本其過去的作風坦白誠摯，關愛備至，這也是記者之所以爲記者之唯一値得安慰之所在吧。</p>
<p>四菜又一湯　吃飯時接見記者</p>
<p>由于王主席太忙，所以只能利用吃飯時間來接見記者。飯是四菜一湯，今天因在座尙有李副軍長琰等十人，盤碗較大，另加四碟稀飯小菜，大家吃來都很舒適實惠。在吃飯中間，王主席問到我許多關於京滬二地的情况，使我倒反而沒有時間叩詢他關於山東軍政鈑貌。吃飯終了，省府劉秘書長道亢已在會客室等候多時，因此記者只得改期再的請王主席說明魯省現况了。</p>
<p>王主席住處是濟南舊德國領事館。記者在夜色深沉中踏上寓所時，街上行人往來如鐵，各店夜市亦一，如往昔，除掉街口的堡壘和馬路上每隔數十或百餘步用鐵刺紥成的柵門和可以通電的鐵刺木架在明亮的街燈下矗立着，或多或少地顯露出一點戰時氣氛外，整個濟南市，仍平靜地躺在四里山和馬鞍山的山根。</p>
<p>二十四小時中所接觸到的濟南委實是太少，這裏且作爲今後通訊的一個楔子吧。</p>

<h3>彭蠡湖畔的豐稔</h3>
<p>— 本報特的記者兪寗頗</p>
<p>鄱陽六日訊</p>
<p>法國經濟學家格尼說：「有生命之個人的富，即動物體的富爲其血，而社會體的富，即爲物。「物即指農產品而言，因爲農產品，可引外界的提取，即能增加社會體的富。換句話說：一國一省一縣一鄉有了社會體的富，則一國一省一縣一鄉的經濟和賦稅，都奠定了它的源泉和基礎。</p>
<p>贛北沿鄱湖各縣農作物產的蘊藏，實具備上項社會富的條件，它和贛河，撫河，修河，信河，饒河，五大支幹流域，可說是江西生產界的驕子，也是全省農產品的府庫所在，在東南數省中，江西被稱爲富庶之區，亦就賴此鄱湖和贛，撫，修，信，饒，五大生產區爲其最力的支柱。</p>
<p>記者今就贛北沿鄱湖各縣本年農作物最著的稻穀，青靛，蔗糖，蓮子，棉花，烟草，等的產銷情形，窺探所得，作一個間賅的報導：但着手來寫這篇通信，腦子裏就深印着那偉大的湖水，含有多量的欣羨－羨它能够孕育出這許多關於有益人生的衣食原料。所以對沿湖的每一產品，特提出它的功用和旨趣，不以物類而單稱，俾與動靜俱生的湖水，兩相配合，而益顯它的偉大無涯。</p>
<p>東南糧倉　荒年不聞枵腹</p>
<p>贛北饒河昌江，樂江各縣，地濱鄱湖，平原沃野，灌溉便利，爲最　宜耕作之區，古語有云：「江西熟，東南足。」這話的確不錯。據江西通志載：淸初全省稻田，有四千七百八十二萬七千餘畝，民二十年立法院統計處估計，全省稻田，有四千一百六十三萬餘畝，省府經委會估計，全省農田爲五千二百萬畝，其中可種稻田，平均扯作六成五，每畝每年米穀產量，年收一次至二次合併計算起來，豐收之歲，至少可產穀一萬三千二百十五萬八千餘石，民二十五年省府統計室根據八十三縣的報吿：總計早稻，中稻，晚稻，糯稻，有一萬一千九百餘萬石，除供木省民食和銷用外，每年可剩餘稻穀二百萬石，其中剩餘三分之一的數量，俱在鄱湖各縣倉庫產生出來的。　又據二十二年江西省政府經委會估計沿湖各縣讓稻數量計餘干二·七八〇·〇〇〇担，萬年九八二·八〇〇担，餘江一·三三八·七五〇祖，星子四一八·三三五担，都昌一·五一四·八五二祖，湖口六四七·五一六担，鄱陽四。四六六·九〇〇担，浮梁一·六五六·六〇八担，樂平一·九四六·五八〇担，德興七五六·〇〇〇祖，民二十四年饒河區產稻數量，計早稻有三·三〇九，六〇〇担，中稻九九七·六〇〇担，晚稻一·九一二·二〇〇担，糯稻二七七·二〇〇石，總計六·四九六·六〇〇石，以濱湖十縣佔全省八分之一的一隅，稻產有這麼多的數量，眞不愧乎糧倉的命名了。</p>
<p>今歲濱湖各縣的早·中晚·稻·雖夏間曾一度險遭白水的冲泛，但基本圩堤，多未決口，秋後久晴，稻田轉險爲安，秋收結果，普稱豐稔，萬（年）稻的收獲量，允溢倍於豐年，估計沿湖各縣稻產，平均差有足額收成，自力更生的農民，它們耗去了力和汗的辛勞，換來了滿車滿庫黃金色的稻粒，便生斯食斯的男婦老幼，都得含脯鼓腹，過着物阜民康的昇平日子。碰着荒歉之年，可把剩餘，補他不足，所謂兇年不戲啼　，轉瞬冬耕停作，正是它們休息的餘閑，試瞧那湖畔農家，寒夜聚農三四，噓烟烤火，互談桑麻，開始作它們的爐邊閒話。</p>
<p>色染天藍　增美靑衫不少</p>
<p>土靛遠在數千年前由印度傳種我國的，爲染料中最古的有色植物，鄱湖上流的樂平，鄰接湖濱，氣候溫和，土層深厚，土壤爲不濕的粘土，朝露夜潮，爲最宜植靛之區。靛屬一種藍草，有藝藍，苜藍之分，　藍成靛染色，初看鮮艷光澤，但久則翻靑，漸失染色效能，苜藍成靛染色，看似暗淡無光，有安安南的色相，靛漿能保持數年不透色。</p>
<p>樂平靛靑產量，過去年約四十萬至五十萬市石，　藍佔三分之一，苜藍佔三分之二，全縣種靛面積，的三四十萬畝，靛農約二十萬人，每畝產靛量，蓼藍自一市石半至二市石，苜藍自二市石至三市石，在洋靛未侵內銷的時候，內地手工紡織的寳藍，月藍，靑藍，土布，都用土靛染色，那時樂靛染坊，多至七十餘家，大的有技工百餘人，這算是樂平靛業的黃金時代。自被洋靛輸入侵銷，用者以它價廉工省，原有工靛市塲，日趨狹溢。抗戰發生後，洋靛絕塞，土靛需要復興，又漸漸的昂起頭來，去歲產地市價每百斤由三四千激漲至七萬出關，靛農和靛商，無不大獲其利。</p>
<p>今歲樂地藍靛收穫，允見豐於往年，月來價格，雖見低落，仍在五六萬間盤旋不墮，津滬蘇杭潯省各地，還有輸銷，種靛的農民，以去年豐於收益，只知先盡地利，再祝奢酬。每値深秋藍苗成熟時，河邊木桶排列，嗚嗚攪靛之聲。觸見充聞，不稍停息，它們一種動工樂業的精神，表現於每一個靛農眉宇笑語間，內地農村質樸無華的男婦服着天然美的藍掛靑衫，都是經過它們的力和汗相換而來的。</p>
<p>甘之如飴　象徵文化進步</p>
<p>贛省爲我國糖產重要區域，產地幾遍全省，而尤以舊贛州，饒州·兩府屬爲最著，鄱湖上流的樂平·德興·等縣，甘蔗種植頗廣，甘蔗就是製糖的最好原料，在沿湖澆河區的產蔗縣份，有鄱陽·浮梁·萬年·樂平·德興五縣，上列五縣中蔗糖的產量，以樂平爲最富，樂產甘蔗，幹長而甜。在饒河區所產的甜蔗命名，多以樂蔗稱之。</p>
<p>全境栽種面積，計樂平有蔗田七·三五〇畝，萬年五二〇畝，鄱陽一·〇〇〇畝，浮梁五·四三八畝，德興四·二〇〇畝，樂平年產量有五五三·〇〇〇担，萬年四三·〇〇〇祖，浮梁一九〇·三三〇担，鄱陽六〇·〇〇〇担，萬年二二·五〇〇担，總興一三·四〇〇担，在民十六七年，樂德兩縣土製糖廠，共有七十餘家。輸出糖値，不下八十餘萬元，餘江年產糖九萬担，萬年二萬担，餘干十一萬担，合計輸出總値，稍决於樂平，製出的糖，均屬赤砂·乾塊·兩種，雖外糖大量在內地傾銷，因爲赤白質味的不同，紅白各有各的銷路。在近抗戰期間，外糖來源吿閉，內地用戶，都取蔗糖而代之，銷量逐歲增加，價亦隨漲，距今十年前，蔗糖每担市價，僅七八元至十五六元不等，去歲已狂漲至五萬到七萬元。</p>
<p>今歲產地農民，以糖的收益頗豐，都大量的從事生產，上月旬已開始收蔗，本月內可全部竣，產量比去年增加，各糖廠坊，正準備置車熬製，糖戶陳貨，早吿稀薄，多趕新糖應市，現市陳糖，眞尖九萬，赤砂八萬五千，原水赤砂六萬，漏水三萬，將來市價，還有增漲可能。</p>
<p>最鈑七八年來，蔗糖產銷的俏，實爲增厚蔗農莫大的利源·產地糖戶，除日常嗜用作果品外，許多食物，都用糖製，似象徵產糖區的人民悠閒地度過它們甜美的生活，又和文明與物並行的學說：「文化進步的國家，糖的消費量亦最多。」這樣說來，不僅是增長地方的財富，且更促成地方文化的進步。</p>
<p>香飄紅藕　湖間遍貼荷錢</p>
<p>鄱陽地多平原，且富湖沼，農民因地制宜，栽蓮極盛，蓮子產量亦最豐，爲鄱農一年主要的收益副業。鄱蓮出品，不亞湘產，粒大粉厚，質味殊佳，蓮分紅白兩種，紅的較盛，質以白的較優地湖沼，全屬沒骨圩泥，濕鬆肥沃，栽蓮頗易，農民不費辛力的隨意隨地佈種，任它自然的生長。至蓮熟剝收子後，冬間湖水乾涸時，繼續地挖掘藕根，或作菜看，或製藕粉，都稱珍味。鄱蓮市價，戰前每担，祇二三十元，近年價逐增高，去年產地售價九萬至十一萬，本年新產白蓮，月來已升至十八萬元，輸銷於滬蘇潯漢各埠。</p>
<p>湖蓮最怕的是白水冲泛，傷損荷莖，莖經被折，不能滋長蓮房，子遂衰萎，如果沒有水災之年，出產旣獲豐收，尤其是荷莖壯茁，蓮葉田田，紅白含葩，晨夕開吐，襯托出一種天然有色的畫圖。果便你讀過愛蓮說那篇文章，去看湖間亭亭玉立的蓮房香藕，魚戲荷錢那樣的風趣，莫不油然地和周子發生同樣愛癖的感！</p>
<p>衣被生民　禦寒堪抵絲帛</p>
<p>贛北饒屬各縣，爲鄱陽湖畔的冲積地，是最宜棉作之區，全省植棉面積，亦以都昌·鄱陽·餘干·萬年·湖口·樂平·浮梁·諸縣爲最廣，棉種多屬中棉，有白籽。黑籽。光籽二種，品質優良的，首推湖口白籽棉，爲全省棉中最佳的品種，即在國內中棉品級中，亦佔有相當的地位，滬漢市塲稱爲九江花者，即屬此棉。它的特　，爲發育强，生產富，每畝籽花收穫，價在一百一十斤至二百斤，祇因纖維粗短，不能紡織二十支以上的棉紗，其他之一至八分之五吋，只能紡八至十六支棉紗，以視他省改良的中美棉種品質，瞠乎其後。</p>
<p>過去較棉銷路，如九江·湖口棉，大半供銷潯市久興紗廠所購用。其餘的多供自用，或爲內地手工織布，據九江關統計贛棉輸出數量，以民十九年爲最多，計有七〇·八〇九擔，比之陝鄂江浙等省棉花的輸出量，是百不殆一耳。</p>
<p>今幾各縣棉產，以一般而言，尚稱豐稔，惟棉田面積，比前增加，但因今夏雨量過多，發育不長，入秋後天氣亢旱，棉作後期發育，稍受阻碍，較之第一次估計時，略有遜色，以各地棉田的增植，平均生產數量，當不致短少，本年新花上市的時候，花販零進籽棉市價，每斤自六百至一千，的折皮棉一擔，合價二十四五萬元，比去年的增十倍，月來各販行莊，因價格的提昂，湖江花市，開十七萬至十九萬元，花銷已趨黯淡，棉農收穫的花，亦多扳緊不售。</p>
<p>它們植棉的原旨，第一是求自用，如果銷俏價漲，則以剩餘的沽出，銷滯價落，則悉數儲藏，以備隨時爲被絮棉衣的需，婦女能紡紗的紡紗，能織布的織布，紡織不能的，則以花換布，只求禦寒，不慕衣錦，任市上有疋如何的在漲，它們是簡直不受絲毫影響的。大有印聖甘地的作風，自種自紡自織自穿，是一種不求人的自力更生主義。至於那絲綢和毛織品，更與它們距離好遠，始終和它是不發生衣緣的，「布衣暖，菜根香生產滋味長」，這彷彿　它們現實生活的寫照。</p>
<p>噓煙一縷　透出畢樣清芬</p>
<p>贛省烟葉產區，有南雄·瑞昌·進賢·瑞金·廣豐·都昌。鄱陽·等縣，烟質的優，以南雄·瑞金爲最。鄱陽次之，都昌又次之，鄱都種烟的面積頗廣，爲農村主要副業收入的大宗，戰前贛烟輸出總値，年有三百餘萬元，農民種植烟草，多寡不一，大半栽在平原空隙間，栽種的手續，農歷三四月間，將　　的烟籽散播下種，用豆餅作　料和於烟田的泥土中後，耕耘一次，築成一條的土壟，經過一定時間，將烟苗秧移植在烟田上面，五六月間，即長成烟草，再過一個短時間，就可收穫，烟葉的收　過程有兩期「伏葉」和「秋葉」，伏葉的質味較優，價較貴，收穫期在伏暑天氣，秋葉是秋期收穫的，質見遜，價較低。</p>
<p>現在物價在漲，烟絲每爾售價百餘元，農民對畢煙的嗜好頗深，爲它們田間操作不可須臾比的一個好伴友。產地的烟農爲免利源外溢，多以自種的烟葉，自已紥創製烟絲，自種自製自吸，它們吸烟的烟筒，都是用竹根製的，上繫裝烟的烟袋，日常插在腰間無論是閑忙時候，都不可一時無此君，偶持敬客初嘗，噓烟一綫，特別透出異樣消芳的香味來，這「相思草」消遺的功能，並不亞於「寒夜客來茶當酒。」</p>

<h3>台灣十大航線</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>花蓮港十一日航訊</p>
<p>從日本人裏接收過來的台灣省，今春幾個月的悄景是不堪回憶的，那種紛雜擠軋，誤點的情形，到現在還沒使人忘記；，可是道畢竟是暫時的過渡的現象，半年來交通的急切改善和整理，已縮短了基隆高雄港口對國內的距離，同時本省人也深感到只有惑謝交通的迅速復原，使台灣成爲名符其實的中國的一省。</p>
<p>最顯著的是鐵路運輸力恢復到百分之一百。原先每天以六十列車運送，現在已達一二〇列。公路方面，幹綫維持每天一班，决要的一天四班，最要的要能達五分鐘一班，像台北到基隆綫。港口的淸理王作，基慶和高雄已打撈起五萬噸的沉船一內有九艘已着陸，還有基隆二條高雄三條正在打撈中。港口的戰時景象，現在巳不再能追尋了。</p>
<p>訊者在旅途花蓮港的旅社裏，和掌握新生合灣交通命脉的任顯羣處長訪談半小時，他對記者說：從來年一月份起到六月止，對內外的航綫將建立八條，還有在下半年度一定要完成的兩條，共有十大航綫，包括：</p>
<p>（一）台灣東綫：從　隆到東部的蘇澳，花蓮港，台東，火燒島，紅頭嶼，高雄，澎湖，以五百噸的船行駛，一月間開始。</p>
<p>（二）台灣，厦門，福州三角形航錢。</p>
<p>（三）上海綫：道是定期的航輸，已決定有三艘輪流航行，十天一班，其中一艘，三十六小時可到達。</p>
<p>（四）靑島，天津綫，一月二次。</p>
<p>（五）汕頭，香港綫，一月二次。</p>
<p>（六）溫州綫。</p>
<p>（七）長江綫，直放漢口。</p>
<p>（八）大連綫，時局穩定立即通航。</p>
<p>（九）菲列賓綫。</p>
<p>（十）新加坡綫。</p>
<p>（九）（十）決定在下半年度開始，這個即待實　的　路以外，還準備成立省航空公司，明年度本省空運可以恢復。這些統在兩個政策之下積極展開，主要的著重在政治意義和增加省庫收入——鼓勵來台旅行；其二是決定　隆成爲單純的貿易港，所有的外貨統由該港轉運華南各地；南部的高雄港則成爲對國內，南洋各地交通的重點！目前空隆的倉庫已經由二萬噸的儲藏量擴展到八萬噸，預計明年終達二十萬噸。高雄港則由四萬五千噸期能達十五萬噸，一般的旅行設備也正在設計之中。</p>
<p>在人力物力相當艱苦的台省，要能如期地完成這十條航綫，任處長深瞭解這例須遭遇到的難題。但他坦誠堅決地說，困難只有克服沒有其他辦法。他更指出眼前本省航業的有利條件是價廉，手續簡化，還有就是恰和國內相反的「供過於求」。</p>
<p>任處長深信以他半年來整理交通的精神和經騐，明年的海上交通絕不致成爲問題。因爲這不但繁榮了本省，而且更加强了孤懸海外的台省對國內的向心力，台灣，國內，兩面的航程縮短了了！基隆，高雄，它也將在世界貿易交通上，重新回復到先前的光榮！」</p>
<h3>九龍行總　貨倉大火</h3>
<p>— 本報特的記者子健</p>
<p>九龍十八日航訊</p>
<p>行政院善救總署在香港對岸九龍半島尖沙嘴漆威道所設的貨倉，十七晚十時半，忽起大火，燃燒一小時半之久。</p>
<p>香港海陸軍亦出動協助救火，因爲當地除行總貨倉外，幷有香港軍事當局的停車塲，停有軍車數百輛。火勢幸未蔓延，即行總貨倉若干汽車及重要器材（包括一副價値六十萬元之車床）亦吿無恙。據目下得知已損失的貨物，內有大批汽車膠輪，的有數百隻，汽油若干桶，其他尙待調查。</p>
<p>行總貨倉在漆威道與加迎威老道交界處，佔地頗大，四週圍以鐵絲網，聯總所運到之車輛及有關用具，均存於此。塲之一端，築有兩木屋爲寫字樓，一存貯車胎，帆布等。另一則爲發電房，緣該處入夜即黑如墨，當局爲保護存貨，免爲歹徒偸竊特自行發電，使四週光亮，看管人易於防範。電機房側，有四個房間，看更人及電機司機均居於此。據稱昨晚開始發電後，司機者外出，不料或因時間過久，熱力太高，不知如何，突使其側之木板燃着，遂做成這個大火的起因。木板的火勢，隨即延及房內什物及存貯車胎帆布之木屋，時火勢更烈。消防隊據報後，三輛滅火車即馳至救援，惟抵達後半小時，始有水到，蓋晚上制水之故也。在水未到達前，消防人員，祇得以滅火筒施救及拆路，使火勢不致蔓延他處，迨開喉時，兩座小木屋幾已燒燬無餘，然因多爲車胎，勢仍甚烈，於燃燒中，常發生類似小爆炸聲，至十一時四十分以後，火勢已完全被控制，十二時許熄滅。當時適吹西北風，未有延及其側之大部車輛。其側有未裝之汽車百數十箱，疊高的三丈，而佔面積達六七丈，另有廿四輛新裝成汽車在加運威老道，鐵絲網下亦有六七輛，此外有價値港幣六十萬元之修理工具車床，均吿無恙。當事發後，聯總工程司結頓立即到塲指揮員工搶救，該最貴重之車床亦係於此時救出者。</p>

<h3>戲劇運動的呼聲</h3>
<p>若干從事戲劇工作的同志，最近在中央文化運動委員會有一次座談會，在家對中國戲劇運動發表的意見很多，當塲推定由余上沅先生執筆整理，以下這篇文章，就是整理的紀錄。希望關心戲劇運動的社會人士，多多協助，俾中國劇運得到正常的開展。</p>
<p>勝利的結束了八年抗戰，我們應該以更充沛的熟情和更積極的努力建設民族獨立，民權自由，民生幸福的新中國，這是每一個中國人民的責任，道也就是每一個戲劇工作者的責任。不幸，在還都，復員以後，在準備展開工作之際，像其他部門的文化事業一樣，戲劇運動竟有着更多的困難。這一年來的經騐吿訴我們，如果不迅速挽救當前的危機，戲劇運動的前途，實在難以樂觀。</p>
<p>抗戰八年的環境是艱苦萬端的，有賴於全國戲劇工作者的精誠團結，在中華全國戲劇界抗敵協會的領導下，各盡所能，全力以赴，曾經奠定了相當穩固的基礎，無論是在後方，前綫，敵後，孤島的上海，無論是在城市，鄕村，都留下了有目共覩的成績，直接的或間接的有助於抗戰。我們不願諱言這一階段中自身的努力不足與某些弱點一同樣的我們也不願忽略客觀環境所加在戲劇運動上的諸般困難。由於問題沒有立即合理的解決，今天還依舊的苦惱着我們，並且，隨着客觀情勢的演變，更有着新問題擺在面前。我們戲劇工作者知道，自己份內的職責是排除萬難以推進戲劇運動，但是，戲劇運動並非與廣大社會絕緣的孤立存在的事物，我們不能不請求社會人士以及政府當局對於戲劇運動的現狀有進一步的認識，同情與協助，使牠順利的渡過當前的危機。</p>
<p>在南京（上海，漢口，以及其他收復區的城市）的劇團－包括國營的，民營的，職業的，業餘的－演不出戲來或者費盡千辛萬苦演出了結果旣少好評更得賠本，乃是普遍的現象，溯其原因，首先是娛樂損的問題。</p>
<p>我們不以爲娛樂捐的問題祇有經濟上的意義，透過『百分之四十』的微收率，分明的把話劇和其他種種娛樂同等看待了，我們不否認話劇的娛樂性，不同的乃是在娛樂之中牠更有着敎育作用—一種廣義的敎育，即提高觀衆（人民）的文化水準，並且，從這裏得到向上的啓發與鼓舞。同時，戲劇恰恰又是國家民族的文化的具體表現。這，正是英國人寗可捨掉印度而不願放棄莎士比亞的理由，也正是我們設立了國立戲劇專科學校而遂未曾想到辦一個培養別的娛樂人才的學府的理由；也正是抗戰期間敎育部和中央宣傳部設置戲劇獎的理由。百分之四十的娛樂捐雖然隨票附徵是加在觀衆身上的，實際上受到損失的還是劇團。假如免徵或減少到百分之五或百分之十，觀衆出同樣的票價，劇團則增加了收入，更可以因此減低票價，吸收更多的觀衆。</p>
<p>一般物價的高漲，明顯的使演出費用大大的增加，一弋演出的全部支出，三四十萬元的數目已經很平常了。其中，絕對宜於節省的即是劇塲租金這一項。中國××劇團來京演出、國民大戲院的租金是每塲（每晚）五十萬元，跟着即漲至每塲一百八十萬元，即使能够減少，也非每塲一百萬元不可。僅容七百人的光明大戲院，如長城劇社所租用的，是每塲六十萬元。由於劇國沒有屬於自己的劇塲，不僅要担負如上的巨額租金，還有無形的損失，如演期的遠近，久暫都不能自由，不僅影響經濟，而且影響藝術——合同不簽定不敢　然開工，合同一經簽定即須如期登台而不容許考慮戲排得熟練與吾，這，更給與我們莫大的痛苦。</p>
<p>戲劇不能離開觀衆。蹉跎至今才得開始的南京戲劇運動，也受到觀衆的影響。我們並非苛責觀衆，這却是事實。由於物價高漲，生活艱苦。一般觀衆的購買力大大降低了，他們即使非常歡喜話劇，每每限於經濟能力而裏足不前，這是一，除去由重慶復員來的一部份人士外，多數在敵偽統治下掙扎過來的人們，即使不曾完全沉淪於低級的娛樂裏，對於話劇也還是比較陌生的，不習慣從話劇舞台上找到他們所需要的事物，難於踴躍了。這是二。假如觀衆要求從話劇舞台上找到他們所需要的事物了，我們又能給與他們什麽呢？反映現實是話劇的一個特徵，當他們感覺到此時此地的舞台與此時此地的生活有着距離。一次失望，一一次就要觀望了。這是三。使觀衆認識話劇，愛好話劇，必須有經常的演出和優良的演出，而這正是一件困難的事情。</p>
<p>如果我們曾無意的使觀衆失望了，那是我們自己的過失。我們承認，這一年來殊少新的劇本，更少適合此時此地需要的劇本。當我們要求劇作家多多寫作之前。還該了解劇作家的處境。事實是這樣的，一方面，到現在爲止的客觀環境，不是一下子就能瞭如指掌的，僅僅看到表而上的現象即加以頌揚或暴露，是創作的歧途。這需要時間，一方面，當演出（以及發表·出版）如此困難的時候，是沒法促使劇作家不斷供給新作的。有人在準備，有人在寫，有人寫了而遲遲不拿出來。這需要環境安定。同樣的，沒有時間與環境安定，不僅劇作家，連導演·演員以及舞台工作者同樣的難於有新的創造，而形成了停滯乃至退步。</p>
<p>戲劇工作者的停滯乃至退步，即是戲劇運動的停滯與退步。反躬自省，我們應該責備自己的認識不够，努力不够，以及團結不够。但是，無論如何，客觀環境的改善是更重要的先決條件。我們深信：社會人士和政府當局是愛護戲劇運動的。因此，在此時此地，我們叙述了當前的實况，並且，希望着：</p>
<p>（一）確認了戲劇在文化與敎育中的地位，給與積極的，有力的，計劃的扶植，使戲劇成爲全國人民的健康的精神食糧，成爲建國工作的重要支柱。</p>
<p>（二）豁免或减輕娛樂捐，凡是國營的劇團和曾經主管機關准予立案的民營的劇團的演出，准免娛樂捐，以减輕劇國的担負，普及觀衆。</p>
<p>（三）建立國營的劇塲，完全免費或取極少的租金，供給劇團。開始的時候，可以徵用敵僞的產業代替建築。</p>
<p>（四）保障戲劇者的生活，使戲劇工作者能够安心的，並專心的從事創造與研究。</p>
<p>（五）獎勵劇本創作與演出。</p>
<p>這是挽救危機的當務之急，這也是我們的呼籲。在我們戲劇工作者，應該如抗戰時期一樣的精誠團結起來，克盡所能，全力以赴，共同克服困難，渡過危機，參加建設民族獨立，民積自由，民生幸福的新中國這一偉業！</p>

<h3>出版與捐稅</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>近來中國出版界發生了兩件大事，都是對於出版事業將產生很大影響的。一件是關於書業營業稅的問題，一件是關於新聞郵電加價的問題。書業和新聞界都在要求政府重新考慮，挽救中國裂落的文化事業。</p>
<p>關於書業的營業稅，我們知道業經上海市參議會議決免徵之後，上海全市書業二百八十六家又推派代表十七人晋京請願，要求財政部免微。但是最近書業公會按奉敎育部轉下財政部咨文，只准國定木及審定本敎科書免繳營業稅，其餘仍須照征。現在書業再推代表赴京請願。我們希望政府特別愛護文化出版事業，准予全部免繳。同時我們更希望本市當局一而按受市參會增收建設損的議決，一面也採納免收書榮營業稅的議決。</p>
<p>關於新聞郵電加價，十七日新聞報有一段富於戲劇性的記載，內云：「今日於化去近一百餘億，修理華　無比，精緻絕倫之交通部大廈中，各地記者一百五十餘人爲郵電加價十倍事向兪部長請願，維持原價，以延續文化事業。因在此高價郵電費用中，全國新聞事業均將蒙受巨大之拙殘。於二小時訴願中，余部長稱，彼無興趣與新聞界爲難。」我們頗知郵電方面政府賠累不少，必須設法彌補。合理的加價和　收營業稅，這是國家的財源，我們原似無庸置啄，但政府對於出版文化事業不能與其他以謀利爲目標的商業作齊量觀，面應予以特別的體卹。</p>
<p>不過在政府特別着重於開源的情形之下，我們覺得政府應整頓稅收，剔除中飽，最要緊的似乎還可以在節流方面多用一點工夫，免得過分在文化事業上打算。</p>
<h3>評中國教育改革之途徑</h3>
<p>— 陳科美</p>
<p>陳果夫著　正中書局出版</p>
<p>凡是對於中國敎育能高瞻遠　的人都感覺到，中國的敎育需要一種哲學，將敎育的實施統整在一個或數個原則之下；不能再像過去那樣，東抄西襲，仿歐效美，以致五十年來的敎育收不到甚麽效果。雖然大家都這樣感覺到，但是很少有人出來供給這一種需要。吳俊升先生曾經提議，先由全國各方面學者對於中國過去文化和現代需要作一綜合的考察，確定一種普通哲學；然後根據此種哲學演繹出幾項指導原則作爲理論和實施的　礎，以構成敎育哲學。這是一種辦法。此外當然還可先由各方面的學者自由發表他們的研究；然後再將這些硏究加以綜合，或加以選擇，而定出敎育理論和實施的原則，作爲一種敎育哲學。或許這兩個辦法均不適用，祇有一任各種思想的自由發展和敎育哲學的自然形成。</p>
<p>民國二十二年，姜琦先生曾刊行一本敎育哲學（亦名三民主義敎育），他的意思是希望牠成爲一種中國敎育哲學：其影響如何，不得而知。現在我又讀到陳果夫先生的中國敎育改革之途徑，也是根據三民主義，提出敎育改革的主張；不過這一本書和前一木書不同，前者偏里純理的方面，而此書則偏重應用的方面，有一套整個的敎育計劃。</p>
<p>這本書的內容，簡單點說，包括兩部份，第一部份討論一般原則與各級敎育；第二部份討論各種敎育問題及有關實行改革之方法等。關於原則方面，「完全以我國固有的倫理哲學爲基礎，而其出發點是孝弟，逐漸擴大，以實現天下爲公，世界大同的理想。」……甚至書中的整個敎育程序或系統，即以我國的修霽治平的哲學系統爲畫分程序的依據，使今後各階段的敎育都有一個顯著的中心口標。」（王跋中語）而這兩部份又以原則爲重要，如作者所說，「我認爲改進敎育，原則爲重，方法問題次之。」。（頁一）所以這書的性質頗有敎育哲學的意味和構成一種教育哲學的可能。</p>
<p>今日需要敎育哲學</p>
<p>作者本其數十年的觀察和體騐　成此書，確有獨到的見解和完備　主張。比如他說，由過教育「失敗的主要原因，在乎我們的敎育失去了自信主動的精神祗有見別人，卻忘了自己；所以祗知抄　，不能消化，更不能　　；」又說，中國敎育失敗的原　　））　　　　找到敎育的出　　　　磁　　　　幾子年來　　　涌薑纏　　瞥　　　了」‘　　　　　　　　　是維　山　　　　觀　　論暱留的倫理觀　’　　　　　口口挪　？就是　　　　細低徑　　　　　是作者　　　　　　　　是作者　　個屆他　　　說見解的本身是　到的，而是說中國今後的敎育一仍　要保持孝弟這重心爲出發點，並發揮其效能」是獨到的。根據這一敎育的出發點，所以作者特別重視家庭敎育，「所以家庭敎育是人類世界一切問題的根本問迦」，是爲一生「立下一個做人的基礎」？由此基礎開始，而「國民敎育」，生活敎育」，「特種教育」，師範敎育，大學敎育，太學敎育等，又均依據條齊治平的哲學立論與設施：這是作者完備的主張。所以這一本書又是一本最能刺激的著作，牠可以刺激中國敎育哲學的創造，也能刺激中國新敎育的開闢。</p>
<p>至於中國的敎育哲學應不應當如此形成呢？中國的新敎育願不慼當照此辦理呢？依筆者淺見，略陳一二，以作菊　之獻。</p>
<p>敎育的出發點</p>
<p>我曾經陳述過，中國文化有兩種特徵；一是倫理的特徵，一是保守的特　；我也曾經批評過，此種倫理特似的文化太注重人間　係中的家族　係，而忽略更演大的社會關係；所以中國人的家族觀念太深，以致民族觀念或社會觀念太薄，而不能產生一堅强統一的民族集團，以抵抗列強的各種侵略（敎育與文化，教育通訊，第三卷，第四十一期）。　管在理論上說得很好，以孝弟爲出發點，「把對於父母，對於兄弟的倫理關係，建立起正常的軌則，由此推延出去，於是社會的秩序，國家的平治，黃可因此維持」；但事實上，中國的人民（尤其受舊敎育最高的人民）多祗知有家，而不知有國，更不知有世界，所謂「天下爲公」或「世界大同」更是說不到了。爲什麼中國數千年來的明倫教育不能敎會人民將悌孝推延到社會去呢？這有兩個原因；一是理想太高，不易實行；二是圈子繞得太大，不能達到。</p>
<p>因此，數千年的明倫教育祇敎成人民過得來家族的生活和維持了宗法的社會；但現在生存競爭如此的激烈，民族鬥爭如此的凶猛，不久就會改造中國的家族生活和宗法社會。</p>
<p>敎育的目標</p>
<p>所以現在要敎人民的是如何謀民族的生存，是使全國民衆能在平時生產建設和在戰時抵抗自衛，是使大家具備生產自衛的智能和團結犧牲的精神；就是「天下爲公」和「世界大同」，也不妨緩一步敎。談到生產自衛的智能，常然以科學爲基礎；談到團結犧牲的精神，也常然以民主爲基礎：祇有科學與民主，才能使中華民族迎頭趕上去；也祇有科學與民主，才能達到天下爲公和世界大同。所以中國的新敎育，應以三民主義爲理想，以民族復興爲目的，以民族化，民主化，科學化，工藝化等爲目樑；或說得更具體點，中國的新敎育要養成能建設和自衛的健全國民。此種新敎育的重心在發揚一種新的民族精神——一種個人與民族打成一片的精神，一種委身於民族的犧牲精神。必須具備此種精神，巾華民族才站得住、必須本民族先站得住，方能謀世界的改造，由家族而民族，由民族而世界，這是要人類社曾演進的程序，也是由國社會必經的階段。此種新敎育的出發點就是個性，根據各個兒童的個性，去發展他的身心，使能分祖民族復興的工作；務使個性的發展和民族的復興配合起來，以適應此亙古未有的大時代。</p>
<p>至於發展兒童身心和發揚民族精神的方法，不必繞很大的圈子，即在利兒童的共同天性和特殊個性，以培養他們的民族情緒和民族意識。例如兒童有共同的好奇心，即可利用牠，去遊覽中國的古蹟名勝，以引起其愛好中國的情緒和認識中國的意識；使感到和知到中國是一歷史悠久的文明民族，使感到和知到中國有地大物博的錦繡河山：如此，兒童願爲本國和本民族而犧牲的精神乃可油然而生。</p>
<p>總之，由國新敎育的理想，宜切合時代的需要；現在時代所需要是什麼？就是民族的鬥爭和民族的生存，也就是養成一般具有民族精神的健全國民，從民族鬥爭之中以求民族的生存。當然我們絕不是不要人行孝悌，不過我們以爲行孝悌的人不一定愛國家民族，而愛國家民族的人却一定也能行孝悌。</p>
<p>敎育的程序</p>
<p>作者說「在小學敎育的階段是一種修身的敎育，要敎以做人的道理的基礎，培植愛國家愛民族的觀念。在初中敎育的階段，要養成個人獨立謀生的技能與知識。在高中敎育的階段，不但要敎育他個人能够謀生，還要能帮助別人謀生。所以中學的階段，可說是「齊家」的敎育。但這裏所說的「家」字，應該推廣作社會解釋。到了大學的階段，就敎以「治國」的敎育，養成他爲國家爲民族謀福利的專門技能。再上爲太學，則敎以「平天下」的教育。這樣，自修身，齊家，治國以至平天下，前後運賞，而又各成段落，實在是一個很好的敎育程序」。（頁一二）這樣依據大學上修，齊，治，平的程序來畫分現在各敎敎育的程序，但是在我們看來，一一者根本性質上並不相同。大學上的敎育程序是養成少數士大夫的敎育程序，而現在各級敎育的程序是培養各級人才的敎育程序，二者根本很難配合起來。大學上的敎育程序和現在敎育程序，其區別是很顯明的。因爲大學上的修，齊，治，平是培養一種人才的全部程序，不能分開來講的；由修身而齊家，由齊家而治國，由治國而平天下，是運貫下去的，不能再分段的。至於現在的各級敎育是培養各級人才，可以各成段落；如作者所說，「每經一階段，即有一階段的功效；每敎一步，即有一步的用途」：無論事實上有沒有做到（中國敎育的大毛病就是沒有做到這一點），原則上是應當如此的。所以中國的新敎育斷不能依據培養一種人才的敎育程序來畫分培養多稱人才的敎育程序。</p>
<p>上舉二點，僅就其最大者論之；他如反芻敎育法，三民主義與各階段敎育的配合，生活敎育等均未暇論及；至於注重母敎，注意各級教育的連　性和獨立性等，均有卓見，未邊詳述。在中國像陳先生這樣以一貫的立塲替中國的敎育找出一個方向，這實在是難能可貴的，雖然我們的意見並不完全相同。總之，這是一本太富於刺激性的著作，是有心中國敎育改革者的參考善本，値得大家的咀嚼和檢討。</p>

<p>一般地說來，書評家們俱未曾發表過分的頌　，在　的時報書評　中「一年最傑出書籍」的票選中，沒有一本書曾獲得所有書評家的一致　戴的。短中取長。若論銷　最廣，賺錢最多的，當推蓓蒂麥唐納女士所著的「　蛋與我」——一本關於　雛的史詩（或者說是　婚後生活的自傳）曾銷售去一百二十萬册。其餘的九册最銷書的名單如次：</p>

<p>根據「時代雜誌」的看法，戰後新的文藝天才猶未出現。美國出版界的人物常如此解嘲：離開戰事還沒多久，故而傑作一時還未能完成。但是這是眞實的麽：且看看一九一九（第一次大戰）以後的書目：巴別脫著的「盧梭與　曼主義」，康拉特的「金箭」，凱恩斯的，「和平之經濟後果」，梅斯　爾的「雷那狐」，奧尼爾的「加里比之月」，莫罕的「月與六便士」等，都是那一年的不朽之作。二次大戰給人們的刺敎也許太大，天才們一時還不能通過藝術解答那些複雜的問題。</p>
<h3>「團的兒子」</h3>
<p>— 李錦祥</p>
<p>卡泰耶夫著茅盾譯卅五年十月初版</p>
<p>蘇聯作家卡泰耶夫，他的名字在山國　者的腦子裏也許不會感到陌生吧，七八年前，他的兩部著作「時間，前進呀」，</p>
<p>「我是勞動人民的兒子」都有我國譯本。</p>
<p>「團的兒子」在蘇聯是一本　有火量讀者的小說，它會榮膺一九四五年史太林文　獎，那一年的文　獎金在小說方面，　一共有四個獎。「團的兒子」得的是小說　門的二等獎，得頭等　的是「青年近清軍」和「拉伏伊」，二等獎的另一部小說　是一綠土一。</p>
<p>全書以蘇德戰事爲題材，故事山始至終都在平淡的氣氛中發展。</p>
<p>本書的主人翁凡尼亞是一個孤苦伶仃的俄國孩子。殘暴的野心家毀去了他美麗的家園，　殺了他的父母，使他終年流浪在外面，幸而遇到了祖國的偵察兵，拯救了他並把他帶到自己的團部裏去。</p>
<p>並且，偵察兵們不久就發現了這孩子的天才，聰明，勇敢，富有吸引方，天生是一個偵察兵。可是上司的命令下來了，未成年的孩子不許停留在前綫，他立刻派人把他送回後方。</p>
<p>命令並不能克服人的意志，凡尼亞　決地反對被送同後方面失效後，他　然從　送者的失察下逃走了。</p>
<p>幸運地，他遇到那命令送他同後方去的上司業拉吉耶夫上尉，（當時凡尼亞並不認識他是誰）上尉對他也和其他偵察兵們一樣，聰明和吸引力使他得到一個美好的印象。毫無一疑義的就把孩子帶回部隊去。</p>
<p>凡尼亞的願望滿足了，他現在是一個偵察兵了。當他第一次出去偵察的時候，不幸被敵兵發覺因而被捉。直到敵兵退走時他才得逃脫歸隊。</p>
<p>上尉的遭遇和凡尼亞一樣，年青的妻子，老年的慈母，還不滿七歲的男孩，都被德寇的俯衝殘殺了。所剩下的只是一串的憤怒，悲慘的憶念而已。因此，他對凡尼亞更有一種同病相憐而親切之感，不久就把凡尼亞收爲乾兒子，並爲避免危險起見（偵察兵是很危險的），把他調到砲隊去作一名預備兵。</p>
<p>戰爭本是殘酷無人道的，通天的砲火，血與肉在交流。在蘇德的邊界上來了一决緊張猛烈的坦克車戰。葉拉吉耶夫上尉就在此次戰役中爲國損　了。在他的衣袋中發現了一張小字條，他請求長官照顧他的卷子，把他訓練成一個好戰士。</p>
<p>凡尼亞眞的不久就被送進士官學校，開始他生命史中的一新頁。</p>
<p>故事就這樣結束。作者把每個人的性格都描　出來，淸晰地，使人感覺到書中人物栩栩欲生，這是本書最成功的一點。</p>
<p>「團的兒子」是根據英文譯本重譯的。英文譯本與俄文本稍有差別，俄文本共有廿八章，而英文本只有二十五章。英文譯者把其中一些不大重要的刪去，因此分章也有些不同。中文譯本與英文譯文同，而與俄文本稍有出入。這也是讀者該注意的。</p>
<h3>讀「性心理學」</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>Havelock　Ellis原著</p>
<p>潘光旦譯註　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>芷如作者在本書中時常提到的，現今的人類均已自命爲是够文明了，但對於性的問題，還是多麼的愚昧無知。這一種錯誤的培殖生根，竟可說是我們所處的社會還不足認爲是如何開通，而作者在半世紀前所向歐美人士指摘的話，應用於目前的由國，仍　是十分符合的。</p>
<p>西方人的諱談性問題，是由於宗敎的傳統所束縛，中國另有其畸形的這德觀念。雖本質有異，但是結果是全同的。從原始人傳遺到現時代，關於「性」，人們所給予的神秘帘幕始終不曾揭露。然而如果能把牠視作一空洞的理論，那就放逐到思維領域外去也不打緊，可是又與每一個個人都產生着一現實的密切關係而不能棄却！</p>
<p>因此，雖然，在社會的表面上還未曾能公開地討論，認爲是應討論的事以前，更多的人們是已加以注意過的。只是許多利用靑年心理脆弱和好奇的緣故，大會量的性書早就半明目張膽地流傳在市面上，流傳在靑年們的手與手之間。這一些書，爲了編述者缺少嚴肅能度的緣故，內容往往有偏頗，或甚至於故意歪曲的所在，不僅是無從介紹讀者以應具的常識，反而非科學地常引導出種種不良的後果，反敎育的成　。</p>
<p>神聖的問題</p>
<p>「性」是一神聖的問題，更是一社會敎育家慼負責任的一項　目。性敎育對於國民的重要，不論是精神生活方面，或是羣衆生活方面，都是件切不容怠的急務。歐美人的注意這間題還祇在二十世紀初葉，除了好多硏究的册子先後出版，根據各家獨特的觀點和方法外，定期的刊物也經常地討論着，只是內容偏於醫學或生理。其後，經過了應用作犯罪學的綱目，便漸漸形成了一種有文化意味的單位學科。</p>
<p>本書作者藹理士是較後於福路伊特（Sigmund　Freud）的一位大家，畢生精力差不多都用在這問題的開闢。用他善長文藝的筆觸，他的硏究成果一次一次地通過了印刷而散你到各國家各社會去。他的觀點雖然也是心理的，不過與福氏的全仗純素的「精神分析」不同，因此也便是更科學更進步的了。在本書的刋行前，藹氏早就成名的是性心理舉研究錄（Studies　in　the　Psycology　ofＳex），內容雖豐富，但是不够普遍，作爲一種灌輸常識的手册是欠宜的。直至本書的寫就，才彌補了這一久就盼望了的缺陷。</p>
<p>科學的方法</p>
<p>這一本還不滿三十萬字的書，淺顯地，但是也廣袤地，講述到每一應注意的「性」問題。方法是科學的，更是社會學的人類學的，從　橫的觀點來加以分析和指示，同時亦是敎育的。作者不單是客觀地暴露出一件事實的存在，並且主觀地加以不少意見。這許多意見，都是年靑人在生活的過程裏應遇到而常可決定他一生的福禍。</p>
<p>內容方面，除了如題名所表示的免關於性心理的外，多少亦涉及其他性問題的各枝節。與性生理學，性衛生學。果然仍有明確的界限可以別出。然而還是相互貫通地可以溝豁發明的。</p>
<p>本書的梗概</p>
<p>編製的體裁，一共羅列爲八章，四十三節，外序一篇，又加上譯者的序文一則，附錄二則（內　氏傳略未刊）。形式和脈絡是淸晰的。第一章諸論，講述作者對於「性」這間題的總　的見解，硏究的動機。第二章是「性的生物學」，是從生理的本體爲　而出發，釋明其移遞到精神的過程，而更詳細地分節論及「性擇」及「性擇」的各因素。以下一章是「靑年期的性衝動」，講到愛的初度呈現時所採採的對付，說出種種岐途的慼予更改後，作者提出了對於　年施以「性敎育」的要求。以上的三章差不多把性的常態心理己述畢。再跟着的二章是研究性的變態。愛的象徵，性的岐變，從童年到衰到的種種不正常的性舉動，更加以社會所給予的批判態度，這就是第四章的內容。從這相似的一點延展，便是關於性的逆轉，也就是「同性戀」的問題。作者在第五章裏詳細地加以解答，並且歸結到關於此項戾換現象的治療。第六章「婚姻」，是從心理的，也是社會的，去釋明這一現象的種切，頗有可以補充傳統意見之處。「戀愛的藝術」在第七章裏，是從性的觀點來說出牠的關係，認爲是人生享受的諸手段之一。末了的「結論」，分別地討論性衝動的「動性」及其「昇化」，人類文化的偉鉅累積，脫不了這向來被認爲猥穢的原力。</p>
<p>譯者的成就</p>
<p>更應推祟的是譯者，潘光且氏，本是我國優生生理派的社會學權威，他的努力于譯述本妻，很有劃時代的價値和意義。譯筆的優美旣不但是無懈可擊，且其流　熔渾處實堪令人拍節稱賞。此外有近十萬字的註釋，和從註釋中分立出的一段關于同性戀的附錄，都是把中國故有的文獻中的例範鈎出給予一種新的科學評價，使得舊文藝的無數疑徵都得到新的根據，更認爲是中國學者研究性心理學的另一原始的方式。</p>
<p>理士的原著在二十年前被外國認爲是禁書。可幸的是中國現在也沒有熱心者出來「衛道」而指爲不雅。類似本書的雖早就有過譯或著，不過都是未曾流傳廣的。這書的另一譯本田馮明章譯出，題爲「性心理」，已出版六次。但論比較，則除了註釋及筆調有不及之處，而且馮著關於理論方面刪削得太多。附帶地在這裏提起，但是對於兩位介紹者所賜予我們這社會的功績，都値得頌美。</p>
<p>至於本書的唯一缺點，或可說是作者還不能擺脫盡他的道學氣味。這位老人在本書的各處常鼓吹他中庸的道德觀。然而雖如此，雖另有許多我們不能同意的所在，仍舊不足以減損本書的價值。牠縱然不致於會成爲敎科用的模本，可是流傳在青年間。以及因流傳得廣而散佈着新風氣的養成，和其對於社會的精神觀點的貢獻，仍是不可限度的。</p>

<h3>慧慧</h3>
<p>— 石默</p>
<p>三十三年的五月，敵人攻時長沙，登匆匆的帶了他的一個女同學回到鄉下，因爲這女同學的家已先長沙而失守了。登家裏的人呌她做「楊小姐」。但登呌他的女同學做「慧慧」，慧慧長得相當美麗，年紀看去大槪是十九歲，不過登說她只有一十八歲，兩根柔長的辮子，垂在肩上，一對大而烏黑的眼珠，毫不害羞的看人。來的第一天，登的全家都爲之驚異了，到第二天，登家的隣居發現來了這麼一位女郎，也驚異了，到第三四天，淤近的市鎮都驚異起來。</p>
<p>人們過見了就交換相同的意見說：「這位楊小姐却跟着登到他家裏來了？這是兵荒馬亂的時候，兵荒馬亂的時候，年青的人……不過，」說到這裏，大家都不免要同時的說：「楊小姐倒十分標緻的，漂亮得很。」</p>
<p>登的父親對於慧慧之來，看見甚麽事情都是登親目照料，十分殷勤，也搖着頭說：「這年頭，還戀甚麽的愛？」</p>
<p>但是不久，敵人越過長沙打衡陽去了，這鄕下離長沙不過百里，立時不安寗起來。人們忙着自己逃難的事，很少談論慧慧了，登的家裏對於慧慧，也漸漸熟悉，彷彿沒有這麽一個人，又彷彿是一家裘的人，開家庭會議討論逃難的時候，慧慧也　着登坐在桌子的旁邊。</p>
<p>討論的結果，登的家裏，全部遷移到離這市鎭十五里的山谷中去。從第二早起，登的家裏就開始遷徙了。</p>
<p>這時候的慧慧，忽然活潑起來她帮着搬這搬那，抬這抬那，和登的母親嫂嫂妹妹一起忙着，在她們覺得要請登或時男工來的時候，慧慧馬上將這件事情做好了，幷且做得又快又妥貼，這樣，登的母親覺得十分高典，一個女孩子愛做男孩子的事，對於「逃難」這是很適合的。</p>
<p>搬到山谷以後，這時登家左右已搬來了不少人家，登家是住在佃戶的兩間小茅屋裏，因爲婦人小孩子多，慧慧常在這兩間小屋裏睡不下去，登就帶着慧慧四處去打遊擊，遇有別家的女人睡時擠得不太緊的，慧慧笑嘻嘻的，就擠着睡了下去，大家嚷着：「楊小姐！楊小姐！擠不得了。」這時候，慧慧己經倒下去睡熟了。</p>
<p>但慧慧始終是不大歡喜說話的，她只微笑。高興的時候，就鼓着大的眼睛，大聲的說話，笑了起來，兩根辮子在腦後激烈的左右擺動。隔三五天，便和登及登的弟弟、帶着工人，走到家裏去搬運一次油鹽柴米，零碎什物。登的父親的酒瓶又空了，忽然嫂嫂又記起小孩子的一雙鞋子還留在家裏，慧慧他們就冒險的走十五里路到家裏去了。</p>
<p>雖然慧慧對於運輸是十分高典的，但這是幷不輕鬆的工作，小市鎭上，甚麽人都有了，而且都是有武器的人，有一次慧慧他們四人，在家裏淸理些什物，掮兩袋米回到山谷來，剛鎖好門反身要走，隊伍從市鎮上向這方開來了，他們只好俯身尋小路向深草處移動，但他們是無論如何要橫過這一條公路才能回到山谷去的。他們等等又等，隊伍太長了，等到了黃昏時候，慧慧說等不住了，要跨過公路去。看着前面一個兵走過了五六步，後面一個兵相差十來步，慧慧猛的縱身跳起，飛奔越過公路，低頭就踏進了那邊的深草裏面，把兩個兵嚇了一跳，駡了聲：「他媽的！」以後登和他弟弟及那個工人，也依法橫越過了公路，回到山谷的小屋，已是黑夜，全家都　　慧慧勇敢。</p>
<p>慧慧的兩根辮子，是她最喜愛的，在小屋子裏悶坐的時候，她就拆散開來，央求嫂嫂替她梳，　她打。相隔了一兩月，登家裏滿屋子人都已喜歡慧慧了，嫂嫂也細心的爲她時常識辮子；有時　　　　唇悶悶的坐着，登的　　也要高興的逗她。向嫂嫂　　　：「楊小姐要梳辮子了？」忽然一次搬東西回到山谷裘來，慧慧堅決的要嫂嫂替她將兩根辮子剪去。兩間小屋的人聽說楊小姐要剪辮子，都奇怪的圍了攏來。大家覺得兩根辮子剪了的好，但大家都曉得慧慧對於這兩根辮子有着很深的感情，所以雖然贊成，却同時表示十分惋惜；有的說：「楊小姐不必剪吧，這時局眼看也快要好起來了。」登從外面走進來說：「慧慧你爲甚麼一定要剪呢？」慧慧正在猶豫，聽登一說，對着登：「我爲什麼不剪，還是剪了好？還是不剪給人强姦了的好？我要剪！」嫂嫂搜着剪刀，站在慧慧的後面，聽這話羞紅了這忙壞　　：「楊小姐，那麼我勢了」。慧慧咬着牙說：「剪！」兩顆晶亮的淚珠從臉上直滾了下來，嫂嫂握着兩根辮子走出門去，慧慧倒在床上大聲的哭了。</p>
<p>原來這一天他們去家裏搬東西，被五個兵追了一陣，慧慧聽見後面說：「前面有個女的，兩根辮子，快快追上去？」慧慧路熟，逃了回來，心可跳到了口裏；所以下決心把兩根辮子剪去。以後慧慧西式頭不像西式頭，空　　　　　　，　　　人　都投以奇災的眼光，慧慧先也不大留意，後來漸漸感到不安起來。有一次登和慧慧出去，因爲天晚，又亂槍聲音甚密，沒有回到山谷。到第二早回去，說昨晚在另外一個姓李的佃戶家過夜，嫂嫂偶然的問一句，如何睡的？李佃戶僅有一床破褥子，，登說：「我們兩個人就　　一床　子裏」。旁這一個　　　　人正站在那裏，大吃一驚　：你們兩個人睡在一床　子？」登覺得這種婦人。也無法理喩的，沒有解釋，於是道話傳出去了，而且傳得十分的快。</p>
<p>附近的人們見着登和慧慧走在一起，就悄悄的交換着相同的意見說：「他們已經睡過覺了呢……不過！」說到這裏，大家都不免要同時的說：「他們還算是一對，一對佳偶」。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，慧慧住不下去了，聽到這一些話，她也面紅起來，終於慧慧吿別登的父親，隻身走了。</p>
<p>嫂嫂十分掛念慧慧，要登護送慧慧走出危險區域。</p>
<p>慧慧不久就到了重慶，聽說今年己經結婚了。</p>
<p>登送慧慧走後，十分埋怨自己，說不該在隣居那位婦人面前隨使說出那樣的話來，鄕下人不會了解年靑的人的。</p>
<p>聽到慧慧結婚的消息，登很是高興，不過逢人常總要微笑的說：「有慧慧道樣一位太太，整天也是淘氣的呢！」</p>

<h3>推薦一個獨唱會</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>—男中音呂鑄洪敎授—</p>
<p>不論器樂　步到怎樣的程度。聲樂的償實親切之感，往往　非純粹器樂的表現，所可比擬。假使你不知欣賞夾妙的　樂，你將不知音樂的「魔力」</p>
<p>人人可以學聲樂，但只有很少的人，能够做歌唱家；因爲天賦的聲帶決定了一切。在中國，因爲一般人身體都比較虛弱，一般的說來，先天的條件，使他們發音，比西方人來得小，弱而鬆，沒有西方人那樣一結實，堅强而有力。這在平常的語言發音中，即可辨出。因此，我們可以這樣說：中國人學聲樂，更需要天才，更需要苦工。</p>
<p>中國歌唱家不多，但在最近的上海，却有很多的個人獨唱會，他（她）們的成績如何，我不敢妄說短長，但其中有不少天才，則可斷言。聽過斯義桂的男中音的，覺得很滿意，熱心的聽衆都布望他到美國以後，能有更多的進步，不讓「勞倫斯梯貝脫」專美。同時，我們希望有更多的斯義桂，更好的斯義桂。</p>
<p>這裏，我願意推薦另一位奇特的天才—男中音歌唱家呂籌洪敎授。他對聲樂己下過九年的苦工，是海上名師蘇石林的高足。很　淺地說，從他的外表來看，也許已可決定他在生理上是够了條件的；正如市府交響樂團主任許綿淸先生一樣，他那外表已是一個好的男中音的樣誌。</p>
<p>呂先生是一位「戲　男中音」。聽過他歌唱的，都稱頌他的苦量大，音色柔美。在他的技術中，各方面都表現得很豐富，無論音色，音質，表悄，都非一般貧乏的歌者所可望其項背。任何一個歌唱者，其成功大抵由於各方面表現的「豐富」，因爲能「豐富」，而後方能表現出「力」。音樂的好壞，取決於「力」。</p>
<p>唱小品歌曲容易，唱歌劇中的咏歎調（aria）則難，一個好的歌唱家對這些咏歎調，都能應付裕如，毫不吃力。呂　洪的成就也就在於音域廣闊，音量與表情豐富，即對於歌劇中最難的「巴利阿其」中咏歎曲，也不大在乎。所以，這兒的介紹，實非有意誇張的捧塲！</p>
<p>廿七，廿八兩晚，這位豐富有力的「戲劇男中音」，將在蘭心出現，除了幾個大節目如「蒙面舞會」的咏歎曲及里昂卡伐浴的「巴利阿其」外尙有最Popular民謠「伏爾加船夫曲」，中交歌曲等。我想這些精采的演唱，將使無數音樂迷，被陶醉於「聲的魔力」中。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　133</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「那麽，誰把我的地址吿訴你的呢？」</p>
<p>「青木老師」。</p>
<p>「噢…」！鶴見又有些焦躁了，「誰給靑木長老的消息」？</p>
<p>「尊駕你自己咧」！</p>
<p>「誰」？鶴見以爲聽錯了。</p>
<p>「大哥你自己」！萍子又重複了一句。</p>
<p>「胡說」！鶴見無不擇言，日出了這兩個字，當時覺得這兩個字衝口而出，利害太大，馬上想轉口，吿罪解釋，却聽得對方在電話裏發出了一種特殊的驚訝呼聲，又像怨懟，又像驚喜。這麽一來，弄得鶴見楞在那裏，一時竟不知道應當如何揩詞來解釋，而對方也好像楞住了，正在那裏咀嚼這兩個字的意味似的。</p>
<p>鶴見　口說了這兩字，平常得很，又何以值得如此　禮？殊不知道自從昨晚鶴見與萍子二人，一度在海濱月下談話之後，鶴見已經打定一個「敬」字的主意來慼付萍子的糾纏。但又非「敬而遠之」的辦法；因爲鶴見覺得萍子的才調和地位，實在可以利用，但不能與她親近，一親近就是給萍子一個戀愛襲的機會。所以最好是在他與她之間，保持一個相當的距離，這個距離當中，又築上一堵「敬」的牆垣，把言情談愛的路徑，隔絕起來。</p>
<p>可惜這們一個好「招」，費了不少心血盤算出來的，竟在這個突如其來的電話刺　之下，自己無心破壞了。「胡說」這兩個字，從一方　，太不恭敬，從另一方而看，却是太親近了，親近得同家人父子密友愛人說話的聲口一般。太不恭敬或是太親近，在鶴兌一方面都不慼該。</p>
<p>「真是失禮，萍子，……因爲一夜不曾休息，神經竟不聽話，用了這樣不應當用的字句：」！</p>
<p>「喜…？爲什麼不應該？嗯？…不過我也知道，…你認爲不該同我這們隨便，…總之，還是把我當一討厭的外人罷了…我也知道你始終不會給我一綫的機會…」聲音有些岔了，好像傷心起來了？</p>
<p>…喂…唉…萍子你…」鶴見一時想不出相當的擋詞。</p>
<p>「大哥，你很忙，別讓我把閒話躭誤了正經罷。請你用紙筆記下靑木老師呌我轉給你的幾句話…」！下沒有說話的聲音，却是用手指甲在話機上敲出的密碼。</p>
<p>鶴見一聽這密碼的方式，不禁又大吃一驚，因萍子所用的，正是鶴見發明，認爲無法索解的特殊密碼。於是趕緊用紙筆記了下來：</p>
<p>「玉兒，汝之所謀，必無結果，况已有人，先期進行；宗旨不同，目標列一。故汝當結束一切，速返大陸，千萬不必　進。目前刦象己成，難以回天，此我用周天　宮數學，推測出來，不可不信。浩然老人井上靑木，示」。</p>
<p>這密碼是鶴見的心血結晶，索隱歌句，都在肚內，一　號碼立時寫出文字。又恐號碼錯誤，當下又請萍子複敲一遍，校正無訛。</p>
<p>「萍子，我還有一個疑問，可不可以請你解釋一下？」</p>
<p>「我知道」！萍子又格格地笑了，「，你想知道靑木老師從哪專探出你的秘密來的，是不是」？</p>
<p>「猜得對，就請賜敎罷」。</p>
<p>「還是那句老話，吿訴他一切的，正是　大哥自己。」</p>
<p>「又是用的玄術」？</p>
<p>「一些也不錯。上午八時。他用我做媒介，實行了一度催眠；那時恐怕你也正在睡眠裏，所以成績很很，一點也用不着强制，你把心裏的話，都說了出來」。</p>
<h3>一個聖者一個罪人　埃利奧特的戀史</h3>
<p>— 兪晶譯</p>
<p>好萊塢在猶疑中，原因是要拍一部維多利亞女皇時代的女小說家喬治。埃利奧特（George　Eliot）歷史的影片。導演們要攝製一部關於這位名小說家的生活的片子，但是他們不能決定究竟他們應該慕寫那一個喬治。埃利奧特呢？</p>
<p>這部影片應該描寫全世界讀者，從其作品中所認識釣喬治，埃利奧特嗎？她的讀者都認爲她是當時嚴肅道德的衡護者，在她的作品裏，一樁道德的罪過就是終身莫贖的愆尤，一個人倘若犯了不正當的唆味應該以身殉之的。</p>
<p>還是這部影片應該描寫在倫敦平靜的皇家公園附近許多鄰居所知道的她的生活呢？在她的鄰居們看起來，這位著名的小說家瑪麗安。伊凡斯（Marian　Evaus）〔譯者按：這是她的本名〕是一個淫蕩的女人，沒有廉恥地公開與另一個有婦之婦同居，而住在那合法的妻子的住宅附近。</p>
<p>但是這一個奇異的女作家，並沒有顧忌到後日會有好萊塢的導演們會考慮到她雙重生活的矛盾。她堅信她自己作品中的道德觀，但是她是同樣地堅信着那個永遠無法與她結婚的男子愛情是這世界給她的唯一的快樂。</p>
<p>就像喬治桑有她的蕭邦一般，喬治·埃利奧特也有她的喬治·享利·路易斯（George　Henry　Lewes）。</p>
<p>倘使一個油滑的登徒子談論起來，瑪麗安。伊凡斯並不是一個述人的女孩子。當她墮入情網被認作當時倫敦文學界的醜事時，她巳是三十開外的人了。雖然她有着苗條而健康的身材和端荘的面龐，但是她的條件還不足被稱爲美人。因爲她常瀏覽希臘和拉丁文學，哲學和社會學的綠故，所以她大而藍綠色的眼睛有些兒近視。</p>
<p>當她與路易斯在一個共同的朋友楷普曼（Chapman）家裏相邂逅的時候，她只編慕和翻譯那些古代的典籍，還沒有想到做一個創作小說家。他們相遇不久，就發生感情，交往有二十五年的歷史，這總不是一個水性揚花引蜂惹蝶的女孩子單靠一時衝動所辦得到的。路易斯據說是有瘦纖的身材，茂密而卷曲的頭髮，　　的髭　和眉毛，未始沒有一點英俊氣懷。</p>
<p>更有一點需要提及的，路易斯的妻子常跟着好朋友出門，拋下三個孩子給他撫養。在那時喬治埃利奧特嚴肅的淸敎徒精神所蘊藏着的天性和那敏穎的小品文作家的天性融合在一起，他們彼此得到極大的益處和快樂，而淋漓盡致地發揮他們的成就到最高點。</p>
<p>這裏節錄塢　斯爾德，白蘭德所寫的著名婦女傳裏面喬治·埃利奧特傳的一段文章，描慕當時那著名的女作家怎樣藐視維多利亞時代的英國道德而愛上的那位男子，同時對喬治·埃利奧特的行爲作一種旣衛護又惋惜的評價。</p>
<p>「當路易斯三十歲的時候，他己從事批評，小說，傳記，戲劇，和哲學的硏究，他曾在國外遨遊，因之他的人類大性的經騐十分　　。他也會站在講台上對着羣衆演說，他也會從事艱苦而有興味的籲報工作。據說他還會在流動劇團專擔任小丑的角色。</p>
<p>「因爲他生性活潑，談吐豪放，因此他的熱情，荒誕，和縱恣的談話和能度，時而引起朋友們的興趣，時而引起朋友們的驚異。」</p>
<p>「當喬治，埃利奧特碰到道個男子之後，她心中起了不平凡的波瀾。她覺得這個男子與她年輕時代　居在瓦魏克郡（Ｗarwickshire）以及她所長成大的修道院時所見的男子絕對不同。她意識到危機臨到她的生活之中。她必須私自下一個決定來指導她的行爲，道並不是依據當時英國的道總標準而是依照個人內心信念的諧稱。」</p>
<p>「大概是路易斯先生曾寫了一封信給她，解釋他的處境，並且竭力勸說伊凡斯小姐做他的終身侶伴。後來，她慼允了，因爲她認爲並沒有侵害了他人的權利。她就成了他的妻子，但是不能成爲合法的妻子，因爲他不能與</p>
<p>「這就引起她的朋友間極大的驚愕。譬如說：白雷太太和其姊妹過後瞭解了她的良心仍是那麽完美，纔逐漸地恢復了她們間親蜜的友情。」‘</p>
<p>「喬治，埃利奧特旣是那麽一個極端敏感的女子，這樁事一定特別使她感受到痛苦的磨難。她沒有意識到她的行爲是錯誤的。她從所愛的男子那兒得到完美的精神的友誼。但是她採取這般大胆的步驟使許多戚族與她之間有了很深的裂痕，這足以擾累她那勇敢的天性。她的友伴們對於她的嚴肅是很敬畏的，但是她爲了愛情　絕了道德，引起友伴們大大的驚慌，就像蒼窮落下來似的震恐。」</p>
<p>當她自稱爲「路易斯太太」的時候，這已算是她沒有合法批準而改名字的第三次了。他的教名是瑪麗安（Mary　Ann）她自己改爲瑪麗安（Marian）據說因爲後者更娟麗一點。</p>
<p>她那男性的筆名喬治，埃利奧特大槪是爲了不但要　藏她的眞名而且避免被發覺她和路易斯的噯味事蹟。但是這種願望到了她的成名作亞當。皮德（Adam　Bede）印子之後就被打破了。</p>
<p>在一八五八年麥克阿瑟先生在她的傳記裏說：「每例人都在猜想，但是大都猜錯了。因爲大家都注意在喬治，埃利喬特的一部教會生活素描的書上。」</p>
<p>麥克阿　先生所寫的她的傳記裏說：「當時只有查理，狄更士（Charles　Dickeno）用手指針對着這私密的綫索說：如果這二卷小說不是一個女子寫的話，我願意自己承認是一個女子！」</p>
<p>一年之後，這個秘密揭穿了。那就是亞當。皮德的出版，嘗首題詞寫：「給我親愛的丈夫，喬治·亨利·路易斯。」</p>
<p>那些題辭上說：「獻給我親愛的丈夫，喬治，亨利，路易斯，倘若不是他的愛情賦予我的生命以快樂的話，我絕不能寫成這些稿子的。瑪麗安，路易斯。」（譯自雜誌文摘）</p>
<h3>慈悲</h3>
<p>— 米萊士</p>
<p>米萊士（E．Millais　1829-1896）是英國十九世紀人物畫家中的出色人才，與羅塞諦齊名，算是辣麥耳前派的一員。他那高尚的性格和詩的裝飾的氣分都表現在他的畫面上。這張畫原名Mercy-Saint　Bartholomew's　day，是描寫法國宗教革命時某一個大屠殺的場面，情　逼真，　圖緊湊，可謂辣萎耳前派的代表作。（獅）</p>

<h3>糖與舞</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>沙利文糖果公司的一個女女職員業我說：</p>
<p>聖讓前一日（廿四日），一個下午單是巧格力糖一項就買出一千七百多萬元。許多顧客候在櫃台前，工廠方面一送到，還沒有拆開，便被一搶面光了。工廠出產來不及，否則還要多賣一點。</p>
<p>她吿訴我這段話，我一點也不驚奇，我冷冷地問她：巧格力糖賣多少錢一磅，她說一萬元。我說，不過一千七百幾十磅，那有什麽希奇？</p>
<p>的確，上海灘喫得起一萬元一磅巧格力糖的人太多了，又何祇這一千七百多人呢？</p>
<p>以小喩大，今年這個聖誕節，其它方面的消耗，正不知幾何！</p>
<p>然而，市塲還是不景氣的。聖　之夜，十時光景，曾經隨幾個朋友到某大舞塲去觀光，座上客寥寥，樂師雖然很起勁的吹奏，但那股蕭索氣氛，畢竟無法驅散，舞女見到客人便說：生意不好啊！這情景與去年今日一比，真是不堪回首了。</p>
<p>上面這兩個例子，可以說是矛盾中的統一，充分說明了上海這個社會的經濟上的混亂性。孟老夫子說：食色性也。　還是佔第一位，如果從表而上看，上海人寗可喫到糖，能不能跳到舞，那是在其次了。以經濟而論，一磅巧格力可以　府大小人等一律　到，而無塲片刻之歡，所費決不止一萬元，且僅樂及一人。</p>
<p>但這也不能用作目前經濟現狀的解釋的。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織19</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>賣藝求乞（上）</p>
<p>本埠硬採丐幫中，他們流行着的乞討方式，仍舊是奉行着江湖上的傳統。　派別爲十八個種類。稱爲「江湖十八　」。茲列舉並說明如下：—</p>
<p>（一）「唱這情」—這是一種文縐縐的歌唱丐幫，包括唱「運花落」的在內。其用具分「三木」和「皮筒」爾種。三木是唱「運花落」用的，其固定的唱詞包羅萬象，乞丐走到每一行業的商店門口，便得唱該行業的詞句。而且須切合得體，不得以張冠李戴來敷衍。如果店家不給他錢，他還在詞句巾調侃幾句，甚至作惡刻的　馬。店家也奈何他不得。「皮筒」就是唱道情用的。算是斯文階級，要着長衫，以表示其階級不同恒流。給他錢不用手拿，却用筒板夾入筒內。這是幫中的規矩。唱詞確是道情調，取材亦係古人事蹟。店家逢到唱道情的乞丐，都樂於佈施。因爲此輩身面齊整，不討人厭。但要會唱詞便須識字通文。且須隨機應變，識字不多者便不够資格充任了。</p>
<p>（二）「呑劍彈」—本派又稱「傢裏手　」。其行徑和「山東人變　法，要錢不要命」相仿。他們是以呑劍和吞鐵彈嚇人的。呑劍切口稱「長條」，呑彈稱「含團」。此派乞丐上門，統叫：「老板求討一個」。不說其他的話。給錢便走，不給便用二尺來長的刀，威核桃般的鐵彈，向唯嚨裏直　進去。於是眼淚　涕，一齊擁出。非給他更多的錢是不肯跑的了。</p>
<p>（三）「軟硬武」—此幫分爲　硬二派系。「軟武」丐隨身帶着小型的十八般武器，用　槍在天靈蓋上直豎着。「硬武」丐却不帶傢伙，走到店户住家，不論任何物件，都可以拿來頂在鼻尖上。、不使他落地，十幾斤的大門閂，極鋒利的大肉斧，都能頂得住。這倒仗着眞才實藝的玩意兒，非軟武所可比擬。</p>
<p>（四）「水花碗」—道是類似江湖班的技術表演，計分爲「大花」「小花」二派。「大花」用兩大碗水，用繩結住。左右開弓，盤旋而成　形。須水不下注方算眞工夫。「小花」是用一隻碗將糊結住，　端有一個鈎子，將鈎種入在手臂上，擎住了一碗水。手臂上鮮血淋漓，惹得人怪可憐地給他錢。實則臂上早已　成一個小洞眼，和女人耳朶　耳環的一樣的洞。出門的時候，擦上了些猪血，便和新剌入的一般了。這可以說是「人造自來血」，騙騙路人罷了。</p>
<p>（五）「眞假狗」—此派携狗出門乞錢，稱狗爲「條」。在丐幫中，倒算是老大哥的身份。不是後生小丐所可濫芋充數的。他們靠狗吃飯，稱狗爲「木錢」。衆養得馴服之後，方可上街應市。叫跑就跑，叫跳就跳。以博徉店家住宅中人的開心。此外還有一種乞丐，套着狗頭求乞，口裏還唱着狗吠聲的歌曲：—</p>
<p>「汪汪有財香！</p>
<p>嗡嗡嗡狗來富！</p>
<p>老闆給錢養　玀。」</p>
<p>此輩居然自願化身爲狗，，以求金錢。行熊殊俗不可耐。幫中稱爲「裝跳」無異衣冠禽獸也。</p>

<h3>何謂「秋石」　國醫的解釋</h3>
<p>二十一日見本報「偸小便製秘藥」一文，談及製「秋石」方面，殊覺不詳，茲時補充之。</p>
<p>查我國醫藥，以人之小便製成藥劑，共有三種：（一）小便。（二）溺白　。（三）即「秋石」。</p>
<p>小便方家稱之輪廻酒或還元湯，方書所載其治病功效極多，實則用之治跌打損傷，確有奇效，其他所云，未免言過其實。</p>
<p>溺白　藥名人中白，中醫喉科用爲要藥，並洽消渴，但內服方中醫家鮮有用之者。</p>
<p>至於秋石之名，實係假借，古之方士煉丹之精華，因其色白而堅，名之曰「秋石」。故淮南子曰：「丹成號曰秋石」</p>
<p>至於小便製成之結晶，形狀顏色與方士煉成者相同彷彿，所以亦名「秋石」。小便如何製成秋石？以明代李時珍本草綱目言之極詳，茲記之於下：</p>
<p>「秋石須秋月取童子溺，每缸入石膏末七錢，桑條　澄定。傾去淸液，如此二三次，乃入秋露水一桶攪澄：如此數次，滓穢滌盡，鹹味减除，以重紙鋪灰上晒乾，完全取起輕淸在上者爲「秋石」。重濁在下者括去，，古人立名實本此義。男用童女溺，女用童男溺。」像這樣的製治，方才可稱道地。除此外有若干奸商粗製濫造，取巧的製法：</p>
<p>「……世醫不取秋時，雜收人溺，但以皂莢水澄晒煉，煆爲陽煉，盡失於道，何合於名！媒利敗人，安能應病？」像這種劣品同樣的僞造的還有把人中白改製而成的，服食之有害無益，更屬意中之事。</p>
<p>本品的功效在本草綱目上說：「主治虛勞冷疾，小便遺數，漏精白濁，滋腎水，養丹田，返本還元，歸根復命，安五臟，潤三焦，消痰欬，退骨蒸，軟堅硬塊，明目清心……」（但醫者用者絕少。）</p>
<p>普通腫脹病人忌食鹽，所以也有用秋石代鹽煮菜給病人作菜的，若以本品爲延年益壽之仙丹，則愚莫甚矣！</p>
<p>在各大國藥號內，一二千元即可買得一二錢大小的一塊，其形狀頗像冰糖。好事諸君，何不賢一塊見識見識，如有醫學家或化學家硏究其成份藥效，省得我人多所猜疑矣！（李仁衆）</p>
<h3>建議</h3>
<p>— 肖頑</p>
<p>黃浦分局前面臨金陵東路有一塊很大的空地。這裏地處中區，風水頗佳，假如市府和警局允許攤販在這裏擺攤，不是眞的給他們一個有力的援助嗎？這樣一來，一方面表示當局所給予攤販的辦法嗎？一方面更可顯示攤販和警察言歸於好，大家都笑嘻嘻的，積忿全消，和氣生財！</p>
<p>不過，聲明一下：余非攤販也。</p>
<h3>這是舊金山沿海全景</h3>
<p>（一）爲安琪兒烏，（二）爲愛爾卡脫利島，那兒有聯邦反省院，（三）軍用船塢所在地，（四）軍隊駐屯地。這一塊壯麗的土地，曾被認爲最好的聯合國會址。</p>
<h3>外次甘乃光</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>「打倒列强，打倒列强，除軍閥，除軍閥，國民革命成功，國民革命成功，　歡唱，齊歡唱。」</p>
<p>這一首婦孺皆知的國民革命歌的作者，就是現任外交部政務次長的甘乃光先生，並且是在民國十四年，中央黨部在廣州開黨員大會會前怱怱擬成，從這一點，可以窺見他的才智了。</p>
<p>甘氏曾任黃埔軍官學校政治敎官，不但搜畏詞令，文字也流利可誦。過去深得先烈慼仲凱先生的信任。先生今年適爲五十歲，廣西岑溪縣人，廣州私立嶺南大學畢業生，畢業後會任該校經濟學敎授，著有「先秦經濟思想史」，「中國國民黨幾個根本問題」，譯品有「英國政黨史」，「美術攝影大綱」等書。他的才學，堪稱廣博。此外，更著述有關黨養的小册多種，因又有「三民主義理論家」之號，當時風頭之健，竟超過「老牌」理論家戴季陶等人。</p>
<p>他　好攝影和吟咏新詩，前者的造詣，巳可以躋居專家之列。</p>
<p>今年夏天，他被派充我國出席慶祝菲律寶獨立典禮專使。他近來有蒐集郵票的嗜好。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Successfully Concludes; The Constitution of the Republic of China is Born; To be Implemented on December 25th of Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The National Assembly, inaugurated on November 15th, has lasted for 40 days. Apart from the preparatory meetings and review sessions, the assembly has convened 20 times. The draft constitution has completed its one-one-three procedure. This constitution, possessing unique characteristics and democracy, was finally born in an atmosphere of harmony among various parties and factions. The 25th is a historical commemorative day, and the assembly completed its mission today. The closing ceremony was held at 3:40 PM. All representatives of the National Assembly and envoys from various countries attended. The hall was brightly lit by mercury lamps, and the air was conditioned and warm, as if it were a celebratory occasion. Wu Jingheng served as the chairman of the assembly. Wu entered from the side door of the chairman's office, followed by Chairman Chiang. Wu wore a blue gown and a black vest, with a bald head and white hair. Chairman Chiang wore a military uniform, collar badges, and the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun. Amidst the music, they jointly ascended the stage. Wu sat on the left, and Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Government, sat on the right. After the ceremony began and formalities were observed, Wu delivered an impromptu speech. Chairman Chiang sat on the chair on the left of the stage, with a pleased expression, listening attentively to Wu's speech (the speech transcript is below). After the speech, Secretary-General Hong read the National Assembly's message to the Chairman of the National Government. (See separate article for the original text). The assembly then held a presentation ceremony. Secretary-General Hong, wearing a swallowtail formal dress, and Wu Dingchang, the Chief Secretary of the National Government, simultaneously ascended the stage. Hong held the message and a finely bound copy of the Constitution of the Republic of China and presented it to Chairman Wu Jingheng. Wu then solemnly presented it to Chairman Chiang, who accepted it with a smile and then handed it to Chief Secretary Wu. At that time, it was 3:53 PM. The music rose again, and everyone stood and applauded. Then Chairman Chiang delivered a speech (the speech transcript is below). Chairman Chiang's speech lasted for three minutes, and everyone applauded enthusiastically, reaching seven times. After the Chairman's speech, everyone stood up, raised their arms, and shouted loudly: "Long live the Republic of China!" The cheers were thunderous and lasted for a long time. This constitutional National Assembly finally closed in the sound of cheers.</p>
<h3>Chairman Accepts the Constitution and Addresses the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Chairman Chiang of the National Government addressed the closing ceremony of the National Assembly on the 25th. The original text is as follows: "Today, the National Assembly has enacted the Constitution of the Republic of China and resolved the date of implementation and preparatory procedures for the Constitution. On behalf of the National Government, Zhongzheng respectfully accepts it. As Chairman Wu has just said, the enactment of this Constitution is enough to comfort the martyrs who sacrificed themselves under the leadership of our Founding Father for 52 years and the heroic spirits of the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance. The National Government will certainly follow the procedures decided by the Assembly and implement them one by one. I deeply hope that all of our representatives will assist the National Government and lead the people of the whole country to jointly uphold this Constitution and implement this Constitution, so that our China will become a new China of the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people. From today onwards, the National Government will fulfill its long-cherished wish to return power to the people, and you, the representatives, have created the foundation for constitutional governance in China. This is indeed worthy of celebration by all compatriots in the country. On behalf of the government, Zhongzheng congratulates the success of the Assembly and wishes all representatives and all compatriots in the country good health and happiness."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The National Assembly's message to the government on the presentation of the Constitution is as follows: "On the 28th of November, at the third plenary session, Chairman Chiang personally presented the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China to the assembly, which was accepted by the assembly.

We now respectfully present the original copy of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution to the government, to be promulgated in due course and implemented upon its expiry. This assembly is awed by this extraordinary undertaking and cannot express enough our sincere expectations. Respectfully to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The presidium of the National Assembly will hold its final meeting in one or two days to conclude all matters.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks by Mr. Wu Jingheng</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] During the closing ceremony of the National Assembly, Chairman Wu Jingheng delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: "Distinguished representatives, when this assembly convened, I said that it was the most memorable and joyous day for our Republic of China, because convening the National Assembly was the most hoped-for thing that our Founding Father never forgot. With the convening of the National Assembly, a complete constitution of the Republic of China will surely be created, and the political power of the Republic of China he built will be handed over to the Chinese people. Based on a complete constitution, the Republic of China can be permanently successful as a prosperous, strong, and happy country in the world. Sure enough, as soon as the meeting began, the Chairman of the National Government handed over a carefully considered and perfect draft constitution to the assembly. The representatives of this assembly carefully discussed it for more than a month and created a very progressive constitution, successfully completing a Republic of the people, by the people, and for the people, based on the Three Principles of the People, and becoming the newest constitution of the republic in the world. The spirit of the Founding Father in heaven must be very happy. The Founding Father contributed his Three Principles of the People to his compatriots, asking his compatriots to lay the foundation and create the most complete and democratic constitution, and he has achieved his aspirations. He greatly agreed with Confucius's principle of 'yielding as a way to govern the country,' and also agreed with Lao Tzu's principle of 'leading without dominating.' He could immediately yield to others after serving as the provisional president and acted without possessing. He had the best doctrine and did not favor his own party. He wrote the Outline of National Reconstruction early on, longing to convene the National Assembly and return power to the people. Therefore, the representatives of this assembly also unanimously respected the Founding Father's actions and were able to fully adhere to the principle of yielding. In terms of etiquette, discussions were never ambiguous, and even loud arguments were made, but in terms of yielding, once a majority decision was made, everyone immediately calmed down and did not argue. This is exactly the same as the most progressive parliamentary representatives in various countries, so they were able to create the most complete and democratic new constitution of the Republic of China today. Now, this first assembly can serve as a model for future assemblies. Failing to achieve one's personal opinion is a small matter, but setting an example is a big matter. Therefore, we can admire the magnanimity of the representatives this time. Now, we hand over this constitution to the Chairman of the National Government and ask him to choose an auspicious day to promulgate it and legally hand it over to the elected government for implementation, so that our Republic of China will forever become a strong and happy country in the world. Today, our representatives dare not claim old age. We are honored to have attended this meeting. We thank the entire nation for supporting the assembly, which has enabled it to succeed. We take this opportunity to wish our 450 million compatriots health, peace, happiness, and longevity."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Information Hosts a Press Conference; Mr. Wang Chonghui Discusses the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 12:00 noon on the 25th. Dr. Wang Chonghui gave an impromptu written speech on the key points of the constitution, stating: "The constitution enacted by the National Assembly has been prepared for more than ten years.

At the beginning of this year, the Political Consultative Conference was held, and representatives from various parties and social figures participated. Several articles of the amendment principles of the May 5th Draft Constitution were agreed upon. The draft constitution submitted by the government to the National Assembly this time was revised based on the amendment principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Although the National Assembly has made additions and deletions, the key points agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference have all been included in the constitution."</p>

<h3>The Third Reading of the Draft Constitution Has Been Completed; A Minority of Representatives Still Oppose Officials Serving as National Assembly Representatives; Peace Was Restored After Chairman Chiang's Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The 20th meeting of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM on the 25th, with 1,485 representatives including Chiang Kai-shek attending. At the opening of the meeting, there were 1,376 people present. Chairman Yu Youren reported, and after the rapporteur read the minutes of the 19th meeting, Hu Shi stepped onto the podium amidst hissing to report on the work of the drafting committee for the amendment to the draft constitution. After Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst hissing. The third reading began at 10:20 AM. Chairman Yu passed it item by item amidst applause from the audience. Regarding the provisions of Article 26 on the election of representatives to the National Assembly, a representative raised the issue of the election of free professional groups. Deputy Secretary-General Lei replied that the "professional groups" in item 6 of that article included free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee had a record of this. As for Article 28, the question of whether officials could be elected as representatives to the National Assembly caused a great uproar. As soon as Chairman Yu finished reading that item, Ni Bi vehemently stated on the upper floor: "This provision violates democratic principles and cannot be passed. We cannot be traitors to the Founding Father, and we cannot be sinners for all generations." Those who responded rose up and shouted, "Down with corrupt officials!" "Down with bureaucracy!" and demanded a vote. Yu ignored them and continued to read the following articles, which caused great chaos. People accused the chairman of violating the law and demanded that the article be put to a vote. Yu said that the third reading only amended the text and could not change the principles. The crowd roared! "According to Article 12 of the National Assembly Organization Law, the quorum for the constitutional convention requires the approval of three-quarters of the attending representatives, otherwise it cannot be counted." Yu then consulted with Secretaries-General Hong and Lei, and Lei read Articles 37 and 38 of the rules of procedure, stating: "The third reading may only make textual corrections, and no amendments may be made unless it is discovered that the proposals are mutually contradictory. Moreover, the third reading only resolves the proposal as a whole, and no changes can be made to its acceptability." Some of the crowd applauded in support, but those who opposed it still refused to accept it, shouting, "We don't want to make changes, we only ask for a vote according to the law. The constitutional convention is not a child's play, down with bureaucracy!" For a time, the situation became deadlocked.</p>
<p>At 10:40 AM, Representative Chiang Kai-shek, wearing a green military uniform, stepped onto the podium and said: "Representatives, you are here to represent the people of the whole country, and you should abide by the rules of the meeting and set an example for the people of the whole country. The relevant provisions of the rules of procedure have already been announced and explained clearly by the Secretary-General. We must carry out the third reading in an orderly manner." After Chiang's speech, he stepped down and sat down amidst great applause. But three or four representatives still shouted: "Please vote according to the law!" Chiang then stepped onto the podium again and said: "If you representatives continue to demand a vote and a result that violates the rules of procedure occurs, you will be responsible." A surge of anger began to subside. The work of reading the constitution continued. At 10:45 AM, Deputy Secretary-General Lei, on behalf of Chairman Yu, continued to read from Chapter 5. Except that it was stated in Article 64 that paragraph 6 of the provisions for the election of legislators, "professional groups" included free professional groups, and the Comprehensive Review Committee had a record of this, and that the text of Articles "78," "108," "111," and "146" proposed by the representatives was revised and handed over to the group for organization, all were read smoothly. At 11:37 AM, Article 175 was read three times, and the audience applauded for a minute.</p>
<p>Then Hu Shi reported again amidst hissing. Shi Jian's group organized the results; after Hu's speech, he stepped down amidst hissing. Deputy Secretary Book reported that the last item of Article 174, paragraph 1, was "and the resolution of three-quarters of the attending representatives," the word "37" was misprinted, and the word "resolution" in Article 70 was maintained as the original "proposal" after being questioned by the audience. At 11:45 AM, Chairman Yu said, "Those who agree with the Constitution of the Republic of China please stand up." Everyone stood up silently. The bright mercury lamps shone down, and the camera whirred loudly. All the representatives applauded and cheered and sat down. Shortly afterward, Deputy Secretary-General announced: "All 1,485 representatives present stood up and agreed. The full text of the Constitution has been passed." Then began the discussion of the date of implementation of the constitution. With an absolute majority of 1,054 votes, it was passed: "December 25, 1947, is the date of implementation." Deputy Secretary-General Lei reported the voting results and stated: "The chairman will open the meeting after a few sessions. The closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon. The secretariat will provide written notice of other matters." Then the meeting adjourned at 11:55 AM, and this last meeting came to an end.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>[This City News] The Chinese Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement on the 24th, stating: "On the 24th of this month, our party received a letter from the Democratic League regarding our party's withdrawal from the league. We hereby issue a public statement as follows:</p>
<p>On August 29th of this year, our party sent a letter to the Democratic League, requesting that 'all important statements of the Democratic League must obtain the prior consent of our party.' Logically, this letter does not include that all important actions of our party must obtain the prior consent of the Democratic League. The Democratic League is a broad union striving for democracy in response to the needs of the times. Our party was originally one of the initiators. Since merging with the overseas Democratic Constitutional Party and reorganizing as the Democratic Socialist Party, in order to express our party's position, there was a statement to the Democratic League on August 29th. This time, we participated in the National Assembly in order to complete the constitution, so we hope that constitutionalism will replace tutelage, which is a step forward compared to stagnation at the stage of autocracy. Our party has no military force and no territory. How can we ignore the path to democracy? Our party colleagues were moved by the voices of the vast majority of people who have been reduced to bankruptcy and suffered from the ravages of war, and we asked ourselves if we were guilty. Now we have received a letter from the Democratic League stating: 'It is difficult to continue cooperation within the league.' Our party has its own doctrine and its own political program. Rather than causing disputes due to entanglement, it is better to be independent of each other. As for the advocacy of striving for peace, realizing democracy, and nationalizing the army, our colleagues have already raised it first, and we will strive to implement it afterward. All those who share the same goals with our party can cooperate. As for party members who participate in the Democratic League, in this situation, our party will handle it in accordance with our party's constitution."</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Does Not Violate Law in Dalian Incident; US State Department Temporarily Does Not Interfere; However, New York Opinion Circles Still Attach Great Importance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] State Department press officer Mr. Hite replied to reporters' questions today, stating: The Soviet military authorities in Dalian ordered a US Navy vessel to leave Dalian last Friday after staying in the port for 48 hours, which is a legal action. The Soviet authorities have the right to refuse a US merchant, a journalist, and a photographer on board to disembark. These two people had not obtained formal Soviet permission in advance. US diplomats reported that the facts reported by US journalist Newton were very accurate. However, it has not yet been definitively proven that the Soviet military authorities verbally issued an ultimatum to the US vessel, ordering it to leave the port within twenty minutes, or they would not be responsible. Based on the preliminary reports it has received, the State Department is currently taking a non-interventionist approach, but this is not a final decision. The vessel was carrying supplies and diplomatic mail to the US Consulate General in Dalian, and had notified the Soviet authorities in accordance with custom. It was permitted to stay in the port for 48 hours to fulfill its official mission without hindrance. However, the two journalists and one merchant on board had not applied for entry. During the ship's stay in port, the US Consul General attempted to invite them to enter, but the Soviet authorities in Dalian said that they had no power to allow them to enter without permission from Moscow. The vessel left Dalian two hours after exceeding the original 48-hour berthing period. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August last year, Dalian is a free commercial port under Chinese administration. However, the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet agreed on the procedures for takeover. Therefore, Dalian is still under Soviet military administration. The US government hopes that it can agree on the transfer of administration as soon as possible, but recognizes that this matter should be handled by the two governments.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A Chinese government spokesman refused to comment yesterday on the incident in which a US Navy vessel was expelled from Dalian by the Soviet authorities. Official sources said today: This is not surprising, because although the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that both sides jointly manage Dalian, Chinese naval vessels cannot enter Dalian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Regarding the expulsion of a US warship by the Soviet military in Dalian, the newspapers in New York still paid great attention to it today, and the newspapers still published it in a prominent position on the front page. A late dispatch written by Newton, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper group, for the United Press, has so far only been commented on by the New York Times. The New York Times used a column and a half of space and four lines of headlines to publish the news as the most important news of the day, and attached a map with the headline stating: "The Soviet military issued an ultimatum to the US warship, forcing it to leave Dalian, and warned that if it did not leave within twenty minutes, there would be a dangerous consequence." Reporters and oil merchants were all prohibited from disembarking. The Republican former forum newspaper did not criticize it, but only published it on the front page with a four-line headline saying: "Soviet troops force US warship to leave Dalian. The US warship made a routine visit to Dalian this time, but was ordered to leave within twenty minutes. Two reporters and one US merchant were all prohibited from disembarking." Other newspapers also published the news in a prominent position and with large headlines.</p>
<h3>What a US Reporter Saw: Dalian Behind the Iron Curtain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] United Press, according to a dispatch from Dalian on the 20th by Newton, a special reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper group representing the world's press: (delayed) The Soviet Union obviously maintains its complete control over Dalian, the "gateway to the Northeast," and will continue to station troops there until a peace treaty with Japan is signed. This will be seen in the facts under the technical interpretation of the section on Dalian in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. According to this section: "Dalian is not included in the effective scope of the naval base provisions determined by the agreement on Lushun on August 14, 1945 in peacetime, but only comes under the military supervision or control of this area during the war against Japan." The crux lies in the words "in peacetime". Before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, China and the Soviet Union are still technically at war with Japan. Although the two US reporters who went to Dalian on the former US Navy patrol ship were rejected from Dalian by Lieutenant General Gao Chaynov, commander of the Soviet military in Dalian, the general situation in Dalian under Soviet rule can still be learned from neutral and Chinese sources: a city full of melancholy and coldness. Under the Soviet Iron Curtain, it is subject to many restrictions, and the only currency in circulation in the city is Soviet military bills. Industry is paralyzed, hunger and unemployment are widespread, and prices are exorbitant. Only three buildings in the city have heating facilities to resist the severe cold of the Northeast. The Russian and Chinese civilians who have always lived in Dalian are falling into a deep abyss of poverty and fear. No one dares to approach Americans who are constantly under Soviet surveillance. The people have little chance to escape the arrest and punishment of the Soviet military authorities, let alone freedom of speech or the press. According to reliable sources, a certain Chinese newspaper there can only be published occasionally when its Communist publisher "thinks of some anti-American remarks". There are daily reports of the Soviet military mistreating Chinese and White Russian residents. Many young Chinese students have been arrested by the Soviets for harboring the idea that "the rights of Dalian must be restored to China". Propaganda pictures such as portraits of Stalin or other prominent Soviet figures can be seen everywhere in the city; in addition, there are slogans such as "Peace and prosperity can only be hoped for after the Americans are driven out" to the local hungry and unemployed Chinese residents. However, the Soviet military fully uses American lend-lease materials, such as ships, airplanes, automobiles, and other materials. The only Red Army transport ship seen in Dalian was built by the United States. The atmosphere of fear in Dalian is not limited to Chinese residents, but even the Soviets are not exempt. The actions of local Soviet officials are controlled by Moscow, and Soviet military or diplomatic representatives also live in terror. These people must be careful not to overstep the scope indicated by the Kremlin. Observers believe that it was this fear that prompted Gao Chaynov, commander of the Soviet military in Dalian, to issue an ultimatum to the US patrol ship (leave the port within twenty minutes, otherwise we will not be responsible for the consequences).</p>

<h3>Rumor Has It That There Is a New Compromise Between China and the Soviet Union; A New Treaty Will Be Signed to Supplement the Treaty of Friendship; After Signing, We Can Receive Lushun and Dalian</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] The National Army pointing to Dalian is still stationed in the area of Pulandian and Tangfangtun without taking any action. The Communist troops have retreated to a more distant place. There are still a few Soviet troops at the Nan Shihe Railway Station in Pulandian. According to a certain military official, the Soviet troops in the area and the National Army near Shihe in the southwest of Pulandian have contact with each other, and the relationship between the two sides is quite harmonious. It is also rumored that there is a new compromise between China and the Soviet Union on Lushun and Dalian. A new treaty of a supplementary nature to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship will be signed, or it will be a commercial treaty, which is generally quite satisfactory. After the signing, our administrative personnel can go to Lushun and Dalian to receive it, which may not be far away.</p>

<h3>Many Difficulties in Blocking the Yellow River; 50,000 Cubic Meters of Stone Still Needed Urgently; Inspection Team of the Blocking and Restoration Bureau Was Shot at by Communist Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] The most difficult part of the Huayuankou project has been thrown into the water, and the entire project is expected to be completed before the Lingfan flood season. However, there is still a shortage of 50,000 cubic meters of stone needed for the project, which must be transported to the construction site before January 15 next year. Given the current situation of stone transportation on the Pinghan and Jinpu railways, if strict limits are not imposed on rushing to transport the stone on schedule and in the required quantity, it may be difficult to transport enough by then. If that happens, the bridges will be in danger during the Lingfan flood season, and all previous efforts will be in vain. The Yellow River Blocking and Restoration Engineering Bureau has sent telegrams to all parties to appeal. In addition, Zhao Shouyu, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, went to the Huayuankou construction site yesterday to inspect. The Huayuankou Blocking and Restoration Bureau plans to block the gate recently to restore the water flow to its old course. At the same time, in order to avoid danger downstream, Qi Shouan, deputy director of the bureau, Men Zhenxing, director of the engineering department, and Consultant Tadde, together with Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the CCP stationed in Bian, went to the CCP area in Shandong on the 16th to investigate the dike restoration project. However, due to various obstacles, they had to return halfway and arrived in Zhengzhou on the 22nd. According to Zhu Guangcai, director of the bureau, Qi, the deputy director, and others set off on the 16th and were shot at more than a hundred times by the Communist troops when they arrived at Heze Linpuji, but they took the risk and broke through safely. On the 17th, they went to Lijinshiting and were shot at by Communist troops again when they passed Qiantong. The next day, they continued to advance to Zhangqiuzhen, which belongs to Shouzhang County. Halfway there, the Communist troops attacked again. At that time, the car Zhao Mingfu, the CCP representative, was riding in was far behind. When he rushed forward, the gunfire stopped. Later, they arrived at Zhangqiuzhen, which is the seat of the Communist troops' Jiluyu Border Region Administrative Office, and then held discussions. The Communist side immediately put forward three points: (1) The date of the Huayuankou blockade had not been agreed upon by the Communist side; (2) 15 billion yuan in relief funds had not been fully received; (3) They were dissatisfied with the distribution of relief supplies, and said: If all the bad consequences are caused by these three points, the other party (referring to the government) will be responsible. Finally, they threatened that there were no troops stationed in the area south of Jinan and north of Zhangqiu, and safety could not be guaranteed. Qi and others had no choice but to return.</p>
<h3>Letter from US Reporter to Soviet Military Commander</h3>
<p>[United Press, Dalian, 20th] (Delayed) Two US reporters who were refused to disembark in Dalian sent a letter to Gao Chaynov, the Soviet military commander in Dalian, questioning him. The letter stated: "We request to enjoy the treatment and rights enjoyed by Soviet journalists in overseas US-occupied areas and the treatment and rights enjoyed by journalists from various countries in areas under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. We dare not believe that Soviet officials in Dalian want to hide anything to deceive people's eyes and ears. Dalian is a good port in the Far East, and all countries in the world are paying close attention to it. According to our observations, we know that your country is still using American Liberty-type transport ships in the port of Dalian, and your country's army is riding and using American Jeeps. American airplanes are also landing and taking off at the nearby Soviet airport. Since this equipment was given to your country by the US government during the war, we believe that it is not unreasonable to want to see how your country uses this material after the war." However, Gao Chaynov did not reply to the letter.</p>

<h3>Communist Army Launches Offensive in North China; Fierce Fighting Begins in Suburbs of Baoding; Intensified Suppression Decided Due to Unrest Around Beiping</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, 25th] According to reliable information, the Communist army has decided to launch a full-scale offensive in North China in response to the successful conclusion of the National Assembly. Frequent troop movements of the Communist army have been heard everywhere, and the flames of war will soon spread to all areas. Relevant parties have stated that the National Army is well prepared and that this conspiracy of the Communist army may be quickly contained.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] After suffering setbacks northwest of Baoding, the Communist army's momentum has not diminished. The National Army, ten li away from Mancheng, has withdrawn to twenty li west of Baoding. However, as long as Mancheng remains in the hands of the Communist army, Baoding will remain uneasy, so the city will continue to be contested by the two armies. Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, and even Wangdu in the south of Baoding are again under the control of the Communist army, but the National Army in Wangdu is still awaiting supplies from Baoding, so large armies with supplies are passing through this area. The Pingbao section has been tested today, and the situation is still good, but the Communist army has already gathered a large army on both sides of the railway between Caohe and Xushui, so future traffic will still be difficult. More than 10,000 Communist troops, mixed with militiamen, have also arrived west of Zhuoxian County. The Communist army's reassembly of heavy troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway seems to be due to the National Army's weak forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding dispatch, 25th] The 8th Field Brigade of the Communist army and the 70th and 82nd Regiments of Meng Qingba's unit launched a fierce attack on the northern and southern Da Ran, eastern and western Shiqiao, fifteen li outside Baoding, and Gong Di, thirty li south of the city, at 2 a.m. on the 24th, and fierce fighting is still ongoing as of the morning of the 25th. Furthermore, the 11th Field Brigade of the Communist army fled from Mancheng to the Yaocun area north of Caohe and shelled the National Army between Xushui and Caohetou on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] There is unrest around Beiping. Lu Di on the Sunhe bank in Beiyuan was captured by more than 1,000 Communist troops again last night, and the military has dispatched troops to block them. A thousand Communist troops arrived at Yipianshi in the western mountains yesterday. After the recapture of Panggezhuang and Lixianzhen south of Beiping, small groups of Communist troops have been active in the vicinity yesterday and today. The Beiping Garrison Command convened a meeting of all parties yesterday to discuss measures, deciding to divide the surrounding suburbs of Beiping into five security zones, each responsible for by the nearby garrison, and at the same time, the Beiping Pacification Zone will intensify pacification work.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 25th] The National Army's mopping-up operation in the eastern region of the Jidong-Ninglu Road has been completed. More than 4,000 Communist troops have disintegrated and escaped in the gaps of the National Army's absolutely superior fan-shaped position advancing towards the coast. Some have fled west of the road. The Bohai River bank area of eastern Hebei, which has long been controlled by the Communist army, is now under the protection of the National Army.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Repeatedly Attacks Without Success; Situation in Liaocheng, Shandong, Stabilizes; Military and Civilians Endure Hardship and Resist, Turning Danger into Safety</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 24th] Liaocheng, the most prominent stronghold outside Jinan, has recently been fiercely besieged by the Communist army. The city used to be the Dongchangfu city, where the Tuhai River and the Grand Canal meet, forming the city's natural moat. The National Army has been trapped and defended for years, and the Communist army has not been able to take it. Since the 20th of this month, the Communist army has again taken advantage of the cold weather and frozen water, gathered elite troops, and launched multiple artillery pieces, launching a fierce attack on the city for three days and nights, first coercing the people. Cloud ladders were widely placed, and they climbed the city on water more than ten times. Under the leadership of Commissioner Wang Jinxiang, the military and civilians in the city bravely resisted, and the city was safe. Until the evening of the 23rd, the Communist army still concentrated its artillery fire on the east gate, constantly bombarding it. At 10 o'clock, more than a zhang was destroyed, and there were two breaches. The Communist army swarmed forward, and the National Army was bravely resisting with human bombs. A cry for help echoed throughout the city, increasing with the city's danger.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 25th] Starting last night, the Communist army besieging Liaocheng continued to attack the city wall under the cover of three mortars and one field gun. Under thorough cooperation, tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the city braved the rain of bullets to repair the breach in the east gate and repelled the Communist army in one fell swoop. It snowed heavily all day on the 25th, and the situation has stabilized slightly.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Retreats from Suqian Perimeter; National Army Recaptures Yaowan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Xuzhou dispatch, 25th] More than 50,000 Communist troops have been fiercely attacking the outer perimeter of Suqian and the vicinity of Zahe Yaowan in separate routes for several days, but they began to retreat on the 24th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 25th] (1) The recapture of Yaowan has been confirmed. The National Army is clearing the remaining Communist troops in the Pisu Sui territory south of Longhai. It is reported that there are still three regiments of Communist troops in Guanyun County, but their fighting spirit has been lost. (2) The Communist army in Funing is suffering from severe internal strife and is unable to fight, and there are signs of retreat. It is possible that Funing will see the light of day again within the Gregorian calendar year.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Completion of the Constitutional Nation-Building Task</h3>
<p>The National Assembly, convened specifically to draft the Constitution of the Republic of China, passed all drafts of the Constitution yesterday, declaring its closure. This grand constitutional nation-building task has been completed, an unprecedented event in the history of our nation. Now that the Constitution of the Republic of China has been formulated, the implementation of the Constitution has also been clearly defined, and the National Assembly has determined that the effective date of the Constitution is December 25th of next year before its closure, so there is a fixed date for the beginning of constitutional government, which is really comforting to the general public. All people in the country are deeply inspired by the hard work of the representatives to the National Assembly over the past forty days. Now, as the National Assembly closes and the Constitution of the Republic of China is formulated, we express the general gratitude of the Chinese people to the representatives.</p>
<p>The formulation of this Constitution is a manifestation of the public opinion of the Chinese people. The representatives to the National Assembly come from all walks of life across the country, representing the best cross-section of national public opinion. The Constitution passed with the efforts of over 1,400 representatives over 41 days, with heated debates and repeated deliberations. Therefore, the Constitution passed this time is a feasible national law that has exhausted wisdom and consideration. The political system and other provisions stipulated in this document accommodate the opinions of all parties and are especially able to express the spirit of neutrality and harmony, which has set an eternal shining example for the National Assembly that drafted this Constitution. A country's constitution is the fundamental law of the country. When it is formulated, it must take into account the opinions of all parties and be recognized by all parties. It must be recognized by all parties before it can become the national law. This was the case with the drafting of the US Federal Constitution in the past. The situation was also the same during the drafting of the constitution in France after the war. The formulation of our country's constitution this time follows the established practices of the advanced democratic countries of the United States and France, laying the foundation for our country's democratic politics. This is a watershed moment in Chinese politics.</p>
<p>Speaking of drafting the constitution, the constitution itself is not only a number of articles, but a living and vibrant creation. The formulation of the constitution can only be said to be the birth of the constitution, like a newborn baby, it still needs to develop and grow up. The birth of a baby is painful, and life is produced in pain, but even more difficult than birth is the subsequent upbringing to adulthood. Now that the Constitution has been born, we should pay more attention to nurturing this baby that was born out of pain. The birth of our country's constitution coincides with Christmas, which does not seem to be just a coincidence. Jesus is the savior of mankind, and this Chinese constitution, born out of pain, should at least be able to save our China in the same way. Christmas is also our National Renaissance Day. The Constitution of the Republic of China formulated by the National Assembly this time was completed on this day, which is truly a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. May all the people of the country cherish our Constitution and make the country prosperous and peaceful from now on!</p>
<h3>Gold Rush</h3>
<p>As a result of the Central Bank's continued sale of gold in recent days, gold prices have finally plummeted. In two days, it fell from the four million yuan mark to three million two hundred thousand yuan, a difference of about eight hundred thousand yuan. Other US dollars, stocks, cigarettes, gauze, silk and satin, etc. have therefore fallen in turn. Several small-scale silver shops, money houses, and banks, caught off guard, even experienced turmoil, with interest rates rising to more than two corners, and the market was filled with panic and fear. From this point, we can get proof of the following facts.</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank does have the ability to influence gold market prices.</p>
<p>(2) The rise and fall of gold prices are indeed related to commodity prices, especially stimulating to speculative goods.</p>
<p>(3) There are indeed many financial, securities, and general merchants engaged in speculative business.</p>
<p>(4) The foundations of some small-scale financial institutions are particularly unstable.</p>
<p>(5) Tightening of credit affects interbank lending rates.</p>
<p>(6) The tightening or loosening of credit is indeed controlled by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Because there is a series of the above facts, which are interconnected, we are reminded of the following three things.</p>
<p>Since the rise and fall of gold prices have such a broad impact, and the Central Bank does have the ability to control them, should the bank maintain a certain level of gold prices at all times? In other words: Is it wise to let it soar to a considerable height, and then use great pressure to force it down? If we had sold off in large quantities earlier, so that it would not have risen to a height of four million yuan, and therefore the range of fluctuations in finance and commodity prices could be reduced somewhat, would it be beneficial to general industry and commerce, and the general public? These questions seem worth studying. This is the first.</p>
<p>The Central Bank clearly has supreme authority over credit and interest rates. Just a small test of its skills in gold policy has been enough to make the entire market stormy and out of control. Then, the problem of high interest rates and difficulties in turnover, which is generally painful and heartbreaking, seems easy for the Central Bank to grasp the direction and give appropriate solutions. That is to say: there is a way to solve the problems that industry and commerce are now worried about. The only key point is what the views of the financial and fiscal authorities are. This is the second.</p>
<p>Although there have been many previous announcements about preventing speculation and strictly prohibiting manipulation, etc. But from the market situation in the past few days, it is clear that there are still many merchants and financiers who are still immersed in it, forgetting to return. How should we effectively control and guide it onto the right track in the future? In particular, for those engaged in financial business, how can we make them learn from the past, know how to repent, so as to avoid affecting the entire market, this is indeed a problem that deserves attention. This is the third.</p>
<p>The Gregorian New Year is just around the corner, and the Lunar New Year is not far away. At this time when the crisis in industry and commerce is very serious, everyone is working diligently and steadily, and they are still afraid of unexpected disturbances that cannot be avoided. Looking at the situation in the past few days, it seems that people are still sound asleep, and there are too many places where personnel, management, and operations are not sound. I hope everyone will pay special attention.</p>

<h3>Massive Embezzlement in Jiangyin's Grain Collection; Over 10 Billion Embezzled Through Private Rice Banks; Reported in the Assembly; Urgent Telegram Sent to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for Instructions</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Jiangyin report] Since the implementation of the grain collection system in the county, there have been many abuses. On the fourth day (23rd) of the Provincial Assembly, it caused heated debates. Hong Qishen, Deputy Director of the Provincial Grain Office, came to supervise and expedite grain collection and also attended the meeting to explain, hoping that the assembly members would report as much as possible on the embezzlement of grain collection. (1) The military grain purchased in kind totaled 13,653 shi. More than 50 million yuan of military grain funds are still in the county government. Have the villagers received it? (2) The standard for the amount of rice collected is 108 catties. Legally, it is illegal to collect more than one catty. Private establishment of Xinyi Rice Banks was reported to the provincial office long ago and is absolutely illegal. No other counties have this situation and must be closed down. The Field and Grain Office will never accept rice bank funds and hopes for reports. Assembly member Zou Zongyi then spoke, strongly exposing the facts. Jiangyin has 21 branches of Xinyi Rice Banks, which have not been permitted by the government, and have arbitrarily collected rice funds. Based on the county's tax quota, more than half has been collected. 4,000 yuan more is collected per dan, totaling 108 million yuan, which goes into private pockets. Even if calculated at a 30% discount, there is a staggering amount of 30 million yuan. The grain loan embezzlement in Shanghai was only 10 million yuan, which has shocked the country. Jiangyin has such a huge corruption case, and the government neither stopped it in advance nor strictly dealt with it afterward. What is the system? In addition, the staff in each office do not allow people to go through the main gate but through the back door, forcing them to pay the rice banks. If the members of this assembly do not appeal for the people, it will be extremely shameful. Deputy Director Hong then replied that a thorough investigation will be carried out. County Magistrate Fang was also present, often reporting that the grain office's seal has been handed over by guards. This huge corruption case has entered a serious situation, and an urgent telegram has been sent to the Provincial Field and Grain Office for instructions.</p>
<h3>It is True that Famous Figures in Suzhou Extorted Money; Fan Junbo Indicted; Three Others, including Lu Tiesun, Not Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 25th] The case of Fan Junbo and others, famous figures in Suzhou, extorting money, which has attracted attention from all parties, was transferred from the city defense department to the district prosecutor's office. After detailed investigation by prosecutor Xiao Qi for more than ten days, and two inquiries, Fan Junbo was indicted on the 25th on charges of fraud. The other three, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yizhi, and Wu Bingzhang, were considered victims. Although they helped raise funds, they did not embezzle or profit from it, so they were not prosecuted. The main points of Fan Junbo's indictment and the relevant legal articles are recorded below: (1) Fan Junbo took advantage of the government's crackdown on underground banks to tell Lu Tiesun and others, who are well-known heads of underground banks, after Double Ten Day, that the county government was purchasing uniforms and lacked sewing fees, and instructed Lu and others to raise 10 million yuan from various underground banks. Later, 6 million yuan was sent in three batches on October 20-30 and personally received by Fan. All the facts have been confessed. Although he argued that his friend Li Zengyong had advanced the funds because he was contracting the manufacture of uniforms, and therefore asked Lu Tiesun and the other three to borrow the money on behalf of him out of private friendship, it was found that the county government signed the contract with Li Zengyong on November 9. Around Double Ten Day, Li Zengyong did not know that the county government would manufacture uniforms, so how could he have asked Fan Junbo to borrow money in advance? From this, it is evident that Fan Junbo's deception is true. (2) Although it was argued that the money was returned to the original owners separately on December 3, it was found that it was an act after the city defense department summoned them on January 16, which has nothing to do with the completion of the crime. (3) In summary, Fan Junbo committed the crime under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and should be prosecuted. Special Commissioner Sent by the Ministry of National Defense for Thorough Investigation</p>

Assemblymen Wang Guanzhi and Chu Zuoshi expressed that the shipping revenue figures in the construction report did not match the actual revenue figures. In recent days, administrative reports at the congress have taken up too much time, affecting the time for assemblymen's inquiries. Tong Chunxuan temporarily proposed that government administrative reports be limited to no more than one hour, which was unanimously passed. In addition, Finance Director Pu Mengjiu and Education Director Wang Shaolun were away on official business and had not returned, so the group review meetings were held in advance, and the dates for the finance and education reports were set separately.</p>
<h3>Nantong River Dike Prepared for Construction</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Nantong Dispatch] The river dike in this county has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in significant losses. Except for the section of the stone dike from Tianshenggang to Zhouhuang Yini Mountain, which is still intact, the rest is mostly low and thin, insufficient to withstand the tide. The breach in the summer of this year inundated many fields. Almost all of the outer dike has collapsed. The county government has repeatedly requested the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee Jiangsu District Dike Closure and Restoration Project Office and the Su-Ning Branch Office to allocate funds for repairs as soon as possible, in order to reduce the disaster situation. The project office sent Deputy Engineer Li Yi to Nantong to investigate, estimating a total need of 116,698.2080 cubic units, 175 tons and 9460 jin of flour, and 35009460 yuan in legal tender.

<h3>Zhejiang Grain Bureau Chief Urges Collection</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Wuxing Dispatch] This year's land tax has been repeatedly ordered by the provincial government to be fully collected by the end of the year. However, due to the many difficulties in this county after the war, it has not been possible to collect the full amount. Chen Yi, the chief of the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau, accompanied by Wang Jingyu, a commissioner of the Ministry of Food, arrived in Huzhou from Hangzhou on the 22nd. In the afternoon, they convened a symposium at the county government with the heads of party, government, military, and civic organizations. Chief Chen and Commissioner Wang successively gave speeches, stating that land tax is the main source of income for the central, provincial, and county governments. This land tax collection is particularly urgent and must be fully collected by the end of this year. Any delays will affect important political affairs and will be strictly dealt with. They hoped that all sectors would provide more assistance in the collection of land tax, especially the major grain households should lead by example and actively pay their taxes in order to achieve effective results. After the meeting, they traveled by special car to Wukang and other counties, strictly ordering the collection of taxes.</p>
<h3>Danyang Shops: Closure Wind Prevails</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Danyang Dispatch] Since autumn, the trend of shop closures in this city has been particularly prevalent. After winter, closures have become even more intense. Closures of shops are of course not subject to criticism in the name of liquidation, but after the shops in this city close, the actual amount of their liquidation is only about 30-40% of the net capital. Shops such as Tianfutai Xinhua in Shuangjing Lane only return about 10-20%. The method of dealing with creditors is to use the shop to cover the debts. This is not bankruptcy liquidation. This kind of liquidation method can indeed fuel the wind of fraudulent closures, which will have serious consequences. Therefore, there is no need for bankruptcy liquidation to pay off debts. Some shops still have the remaining strength, but they must deliberately empty the shop, and then suddenly announce the closure. This kind of attempt has already been seen in the city, and it is simply like a scam.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Fourth Branch Established</h3>

<h3>Suzhou Launches Science Relief, Students Collect Old Clothes</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou City Defense Command's Social Guidance Office believes that during the winter, the poor people of Suzhou are exposed to the elements, which is very pitiful.

<h3>Why is the Power Supply in Ba City Uneven?</h3>
<p>I live at No. 335 Fumin Road, Nanshi. Every day when I come home to rest after work, I always live in complete darkness without electricity. No matter what I do, I have to grope in the dark. The power outage lasts from morning until 6:00 p.m. or even after 7:00 p.m. In this period of traffic disruption and serious coal shortage, we forgive the hardships of the China Merchants Electric Company. But what we cannot tolerate is that during our power outage time, Laoximen, Laobeimen, Xiaodongmen, and other places are brightly lit, like daytime. If there is not enough electricity, you can adopt a rotating power outage system. Why has the power been out in the Dadongmen, Xiaonanmen, and Dadanmen areas for more than a week, while other areas have electricity every day? Please give a clear answer to the China Merchants Electric Company. (Zheng Yongxiang)</p>
<h3>Plea to Remove Air Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>A concrete air raid shelter stands in the fields south of Jiahe Farm, Liuliqiao, Pudong. It was built by our army last summer. Now that the war is over, the air raid shelter has not yet been removed. However, because the air raid shelter is very strong and has a large volume, it is often used as a shelter for villains, and incidents that endanger public security occur from time to time. The owner of the field has repeatedly requested the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works to remove it quickly, but no action has been taken so far, and no instructions have been issued. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to urge the authorities of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to pay attention! (Wu Shujing)</p>
<h3>Small Hotels in Western Shanghai Should be Corrected</h3>
<p>What I want to report to you is the bad situation of small hotels in the Shanghai West area, such as the hotels in Huai'an Road, Maigen Road, and Kader Road. Recently, they have refused to accommodate regular merchants, because a regular guest usually calculates the room fee for one day for two half-days or a whole night (such as from 1:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. the next day, not exceeding 24 hours). However, for general unofficial passengers who use the hotel as a place for men and women to meet illegally, a few hours are calculated as one day's room fee, and there are extra small accounts. Therefore, the bosses and waiters of these small hotels are particularly welcome, so that regular guests are refused. They would rather leave the rooms empty and make huge profits. For example, when a regular guest goes to book a room, the waiter must ask, "Sir, are you staying overnight?" If the answer is yes, then the waiter will impolitely say, "Sorry, we are full, there are no rooms!" In fact, many rooms are empty. Passengers who are unlucky or passing through this port can only sigh. It is extremely painful in this severe winter season when the cold wind is blowing. When I see this bad situation, I cannot remain silent, so I dare to borrow a corner of the newspaper to disclose it. (A worker in western Shanghai)</p>
<h3>The Bad Habit of Extorting Money Should Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>There is a bad habit in this port that has been inherited from the concession era, which is most popular among the middle and lower classes: "sending invitation cards to extort money." In addition to real weddings and funerals, they falsely claim "fake birthdays," "fake birthday banquets," "death anniversaries," children's "birthdays," "full moons," etc. Some even celebrate every two or three months. In an ordinary family, they receive more than a dozen invitation cards a month, that is, more than a dozen invitations cards for 10,000 yuan each, which would cost more than one hundred thousand. In this time of difficult living, how can they cope? I ask the government to adopt effective measures based on the principle of thrift in the New Life Movement and strictly prohibit this bad habit!

<h3>Postal Service</h3>
<p>Reply to a certain gentleman: Your letter pointed out the illegal actions of the head of Mao Cheng Township. The Pinghu County Government has replied in a letter: "Zhu Xuezhi, the head of Mao Cheng Township, sent Hou Meifu, the squad leader of the National Soldiers, and Wang Wenrong, a township soldier, to Wang Jiaming's house on the 25th day of the tenth lunar month to collect the price difference for military rations. Because his wife was briefly arrogant, he sent her to the office for handling. She was released after the persuasion of the bao chief Zhu Xiaodi. She died that night due to miscarriage. Her husband sued the county court. The defendant, Hou Meifu, has a heavier suspicion and is being detained for investigation." Special reply.</p>
<p>Recently received two replies from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works: (1) "Xu Zhonghe Jun stated that the Xijiao Road was damaged, etc., and ordered the inspection of the old asphalt pavement of the sidewalk. The damaged area is now estimated to be 50 square meters. In addition to filling the pits with coal first, repairs can be made when old asphalt gravel materials are available." (2) "Liu Zizhuang Jun pointed out that the area around Guangzhao Road is dirty and unclean, etc. The relevant sanitation part has been transferred to the Health Bureau for handling. As for the broken drains, the damage could not be repaired because the Ministry of Military Affairs was blocked.

<p>— Our Correspondent Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>The cold wave has reached Bengbu, and it is the middle of winter. The Huai embankment and Bengshan mountains are full of withered trees and yellow leaves. After the ravages of war and floods, the cries of refugees fill the roads, begging for food. The Rapid Relief Headquarters for Refugees in Eastern Anhui, Jing District, has been announced, but it is still unknown when relief goods will be distributed. Tens of thousands of disaster-stricken people are eagerly waiting. The fundraising committee for the Bengbu City Relief Center has been established for a long time, and the funds raised are said to be as high as forty to fifty million yuan. However, when the relief center will be officially established is still unknown.</p>
<p>Strengthening Winter Defense: Executing Two Bandits as a Warning</p>
<p>During the period when the poor are suffering from the cold, it is precisely when petty thieves take the opportunity to be active. The pacification authorities here, in view of the dense population and complex traffic in Bengbu, with people from all walks of life, good and bad mixed together, and considering that it is winter defense season and public security is a major concern, have stipulated four measures to maintain public order, ordering them to be strictly followed. The four measures are: (1) Strengthen the inspection work of the checkpoints to prevent spies from infiltrating the market and disrupting public order. (2) Order the joint military, police, and gendarmerie patrol teams to strictly enforce orders, rectify soldiers with improper attire, and crack down on stray soldiers. (3) Send teams to inspect businesses, hotels, brothels in sections every night, crack down on soldiers patronizing prostitutes, and prevent unscrupulous elements from hiding in them. (4) Investigate the household registration movements of residents in this city and conduct a census to prevent spies from lurking. Although the military and police agencies are strictly enforcing these measures, robbery cases are still occurring frequently. On the evening of the 6th of this month, the home of Chen Yi, a resident of Huangshan Bao in the Xishi District, was completely looted by more than ten bandits, who also killed Chen's father, Zhao Hui, with a knife and took away the nine-year-old boy, Chen Jiayu. In the afternoon of the 6th and 7th, cases of fraud and robbery of gold and silver jewelry occurred. The victims were Heji Laofengxiang, Yuanji Laofengxiang, and Laotianbao, three shops in the bustling Erma Road. The bandits were extremely bold in their robbery. The Eighth District Pacification Headquarters, on the afternoon of the 9th, tied up two soldiers who had committed robbery in groups during the summer and executed them by shooting outside Nangang in Bengbu. One was Huang Bin from Yangshuo, Guangxi, and the other was Xie Senqiao from Guilin, Guangxi. They had both served as soldiers in the supply bureau and were executed for robbing shops on Zhasu Road. The authorities clearly intended to kill one as a warning to a hundred, to deter the bandits.</p>
<p>Collapse Feared: The Wave of Bankruptcies is Rampant in the Market</p>
<p>Natural disasters and man-made calamities, one after another, are reflected in the unrest among bandits and concerns about public security. The tide of economic recession, like the autumn floods, is surging towards Zhashi. As winter arrives, the market is characterized by coldness and loneliness. Now, almost the entire market is shrouded in the shadow of collapse. The industry and commerce here are approaching the brink of collapse, and some have even fallen into the abyss of collapse. The closure of shops is a concrete manifestation of the economic recession in Bengbu.</p>
<p>According to custom, the phenomenon of tight credit usually occurs at the end of the lunar year. However, the beginning of this cold winter is the season for everyone to buy clothes and stock up on food to prepare for the winter. However, although large and small shops are doing their best to attract customers, hiring Western music bands to play loudly, and posting signs of "big discounts," "big sales," "60% off clearance," and "unprecedented sacrifices" to attract customers, there are few customers. This shows the decline in the purchasing power of citizens and the extreme stagnation of finance.</p>
<p>The wave of bankruptcies, along with the cold wind, is almost sweeping through the entire Bengbu market. It is circling through various industries like a whirlwind. Shops and various firms are being forced to close down or announce liquidation due to the impact of the economic recession, which is heard almost every day. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, 33 companies went bankrupt in September, 17 in October, and 32 again in November. In this month, the Daxin Department Store on Erma Road and the Yiji Zhengye Tannery on Zhengping Street have also closed down one after another. As the end of the year approaches, it is feared that there will still be firms that will be forced to close down.</p>
<p>Underground Banks: Extremely Active in Secret</p>
<p>During this time when the wave of bankruptcies is rampant in various industries, only the silver and money industry is thriving, and the discounting business is particularly good. Before the war, there were more than 20 silver and money shops in this city. Now, there are seven banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, Shanghai Bank, Anhui Bank, and Bengbu City Bank. There is one silver firm: Yumin, Xinchangxiang. There are nine money shops: Fucheng, Anli, etc. In addition, there are secret underground banks operating. Due to the needs of the objective environment, they are springing up like mushrooms after rain and are extremely active, engaging in high-interest discounting or lending operations. They are indeed the evil hands of high-interest loans in Bengbu. According to Yu Haoru, the manager of the Bengbu branch of the Central Bank, he told reporters that the formation of high-interest loans is due to the economic recession. It cannot be said that high-interest loans cause the economic recession. Rather, high-interest loans arise because of the needs of the market. Merchants know that drinking poison to quench thirst is not a good idea, but they are willing to do so because they have no choice. Underground banks issuing high-interest loans is undoubtedly an illegal act, but those engaged in this business are mostly secretive. The Central Bank has the power to ban and stop it, but it is not easy to detect them. (16th)</p>

<h3>French Paratroopers Transferred to Vietnam for Reinforcements: Fierce Fighting Underway Throughout Northern Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 24th dispatch] According to French intelligence in London, the 25th Airborne Division of paratroopers stationed in Bona, Algeria, North Africa, will be dispatched to Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 24th dispatch] It is reported that a portion of the paratroopers from the First Paratrooper Division have already departed from the port of Bona in Algeria yesterday on the cruiser "De Grasse" en route to Vietnam. An official from the French Ministry of Defense here stated that the Ministry of Defense does not intend to confirm or deny the news of the paratroopers' transfer to Vietnam, as troop movements should be kept secret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris, 24th, United Press] According to Agence France-Presse, a communiqué from the French military headquarters in Hanoi stated that the fighting throughout northern Vietnam is fierce, but the situation is "satisfactory."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Hanoi, 24th dispatch] According to an official communiqué, a considerable number of Japanese people have been discovered within the Vietnamese forces in the Vietnamese War. French troops are currently conducting mopping-up operations in the Bo Kan area south of Hanoi. French troops encountered resistance from Vietnamese forces on the highway to Hue. French aircraft destroyed several Vietnamese artillery positions yesterday. Officials believe that the situation in Tonkin is satisfactory. In Bac Ninh, the area controlled by French troops has been expanded, and Vietnamese attacks have been repelled several times. The details of the large-scale fighting in the coastal area of Tonkin (between Hanoi and Haiphong) are still unknown. In Annam, Hue City was bombarded by Vietnamese artillery, but the firing was not accurate. The rumor that Vietnamese forces had occupied the Tourane airfield has now been denied by the French military headquarters in Hanoi. The situation in Nghe An is unclear. It is reported that a French military unit there has accepted an ultimatum from the Vietnamese side. The bodies of forty-four French civilian victims have been found.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 24th dispatch] A curfew has been declared in the Saigon and Cholon districts from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM since the 14th of this month. Officials stated that the curfew is purely a precautionary measure to prevent incidents.</p>

<h3>The Birth of the French Fourth Republic: The Senate Held Its First Meeting Yesterday; Presidential Election to Be Held in January</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 24th dispatch] The French Fourth Republic was formally established today. This is the first constitutional government since the German invasion six years ago. On the day of the Republic's birth, the Vietnamese War is raging, threatening the foundation of the colonial empire. The Republic's Senate is scheduled to convene on January 16 to elect a president. The first presidential candidate is the 62-year-old Socialist leader, Auriol, the current Speaker of the National Assembly. The new president will appoint a prime minister to form a new cabinet to replace Blum's interim cabinet.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 24th dispatch] The Senate of the French Republic held its first meeting at the Luxembourg Palace at 2:30 PM today. The oldest senator, Cachen, served as interim chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, praising the French army's ability to liberate France with the help of the Allied forces. At the same time, he also expressed admiration for General de Gaulle, which aroused enthusiastic applause from all senators (except for the Communist senators). Before the end of the opening ceremony, Cachen met with the heads of various party delegations to establish a presidium. According to the principle of proportional distribution, the thirteen members of the presidium are distributed as follows: four each for the Popular Republican Party and the Communist Party, two each for the Socialist Party and the Leftist Union Party, and one for the Rightist Union Party. There are also three vice-chairmen, six secretaries, and six financial secretaries.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 24th dispatch] The French Fourth Republic has been formally established. Henceforth, the laws passed by the National Assembly must be submitted to the Senate for review. The Senate has the right to send bills back to the Assembly for reconsideration, but cannot veto them. The Senate is scheduled to elect a speaker on Friday. The candidate with the best chance of being elected is Triboulet of the Popular Republican Party, who served as a cabinet member as early as 1929. He was a strong opponent of Vichy and the Germans during the war. It is said that the Socialist Party also intends to support Triboulet as the speaker of the Senate. At the same time, various political parties are actively preparing for the presidential election. Formal candidates have not yet been nominated, but informal candidates include former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Party, and Assembly Speaker Auriol. Herriot has supported the views of the Communist Party and is therefore strongly supported by the Communist Party. The constitution stipulates that the president is elected by members of both the Senate and the Assembly meeting in Versailles. However, the constitution does not specify whether to use open or secret voting.</p>
<h3>The United States Has No Objections to France's Plan for Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 24th dispatch] The decisions taken by France regarding the control of the Saar region's borders have not provoked objections from U.S. officials. A State Department spokesman recently told reporters that the head of the French delegation to the United Nations, Mauville, had informed the French and American governments of the administrative changes. The U.S. representative had never protested against the French plan during negotiations with France.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 24th dispatch] The French government has decided to release 70 German prisoners of war in the Saar region in the near future. These prisoners of war work in French coal mines and were allowed to return home to visit their families this summer.</p>
<h3>The World Food Situation: The Future Is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 24th dispatch] The Secretary-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Orr, announced today that the current world food situation has not improved compared to last year and that there will be a great shortage before the 1947 harvest season. In addition to the damage caused by the war, the countries of the East will have to prepare sufficient food for the increasing population in the coming years. This situation becomes more prominent every year. The second half of 1946 proved to be deficient in most regions, but the new harvest starting in 1947 will greatly improve the situation. In the nine eastern provinces of China, Korea, and Taiwan, the post-war impact has kept grain production at a low standard. In terms of rice exports, the acreage under cultivation in Burma, Siam, and Vietnam continues to be lower than the average, with only a small amount of stock available for export.</p>

<h3>Spaak's Report: The UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>Says the harvest was quite significant</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Brussels, 24th dispatch] Belgian Foreign Minister and President of the United Nations General Assembly, Spaak, has just returned to this city from New York. He recently gave a speech to the press, reporting that the results obtained by this United Nations General Assembly were quite significant, can be regarded as positive in nature, and said that this United Nations General Assembly also had its shortcomings, to put it bluntly: (1) The location used by the United Nations organization to hold meetings is too far from the city; (2) Representatives of various countries use their own languages, which makes the debate too slow, but some issues, especially the South African Indian issue and the Spanish Franco regime issue, have been resolved, which is quite satisfactory. In terms of the issue of disarmament, significant progress has been made, which is a further step than we had hoped. The United Nations organization is very different from the old League of Nations. The old League of Nations was a conference of diplomats, while the United Nations General Assembly is a conference of politicians. This is the difference. Women occupy important positions everywhere in the United Nations organization, which is eye-catching, and the position of "people of color" is also becoming increasingly important. Regarding the German question, the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Moscow on March 20 next year to discuss the matter. Belgium has not yet received an invitation to participate. As for Belgium's demands on Germany, it can only be explained in detail to the government and parliament later. In short, there are still many factors in the German question that are not fully understood. If you engage in it rashly, you will definitely make a big mistake. On the contrary, if you let it mature, you will gain something.</p>
<h3>800,000 Nazi Youths: The United States Announces Amnesty</h3>
<p>The rectification plan can be completed within eighteen months; improving the German economy so that it can be self-sufficient</p>
<p>[Associated Press Frankfurt, 24th dispatch] Commander of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Germany, McNairney, delivered a Christmas message to 3,000 Germans at the Leunburg Square today, announcing an amnesty for 800,000 "Little Nazi Party Members" in the U.S. Occupation Zone, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd. These people are not guilty of major crimes, have not been involved in embezzlement, and are semi-disabled. The disabled alone account for 40,000 people. McNairney announced a fundamental change in the U.S. Nazi purge policy, hoping that Germans would step up their efforts to expose "active Nazi elements who are destroying the motherland." Lee continued, the U.S. Occupation Forces had no concept of revenge on Germany in the beginning. The current situation in Germany is due to the Nazi dictatorship. The United States will do its best to improve Germany's economic situation. The British and American occupation zones have already implemented economic mergers, and the economy will be self-sufficient in three years. U.S. officials estimate that this amnesty will complete the rectification plan in the U.S. Occupation Zone within eighteen months. Previously, officials announced that at the current rate of reporting, it would take eight years to complete.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens, 24th dispatch] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris is currently in New York for consultations. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister will extend his stay in the United States to maintain contact with representatives of relevant commercial firms in the United States. These commercial firms are preparing to carry out reconstruction work in Greece.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Aristocratic Class Will Be Reduced to Commoners</h3>
<p>From now on, they will only live a life of hardship</p>
<p>[Our Tokyo Dispatch, 25th] The military and financial cliques that once drove the Japanese people have completely collapsed. The imperial and aristocratic systems, which still maintain feudal institutions, are now being reviewed by the Diet and the Privy Council. Except for the three direct imperial families, the other eleven imperial families and fifty-two nobles have decided to be demoted to commoners from next spring. In addition, the government has stopped supplying the aristocratic class with the so-called aristocratic fees, and the tax exemption privileges that the aristocratic class once had have also been decided to be abolished. Therefore, the nobles who once enjoyed a life of luxury will also live the same life of hardship as ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Earthquake Damage Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco Broadcast, 25th: The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs recently released the following statistics on the losses from the earthquake and tsunami: 1,172 deaths, 1,555 injuries, and 163 missing. 7,149 houses were completely destroyed, 14,349 houses were damaged, 33 factories were completely destroyed, and 19 were partially destroyed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Domestic Debt: 300 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Eleven times larger than before the war</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 25th dispatch] According to a report on domestic debt and government loans submitted by the Japanese Ministry of Finance to the House of Peers, as of the 20th of this month, the amount of domestic debt was 150.499 billion yen, government loans were 23.397 billion yen, and government short-term securities were 20.62 billion yen, totaling 194.516 billion yen. However, within this year, the government has already planned to issue 46.507 billion yen in public bonds. By the end of this year, the total debt will be 240 billion yen. If the 30 billion yen in war insurance compensation public bonds are added, it will reach 270 billion yen. If an additional budget needs to be submitted to the regular Diet, then public bonds will have to be issued again. It is feared that by the end of this year, the amount of domestic debt may reach 300 billion yen, which is eleven times larger than the domestic debt of 25 billion yen in 1940, before the start of the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Extraordinary Diet Closes: Ordinary Diet to Be Convened Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 25th dispatch] Both the Japanese House of Peers and the House of Representatives announced the closing of the Diet today. The closing ceremony will be held on the 26th, and the ordinary Diet will be convened and established on the 27th. The opening ceremony will be held on the 28th, and deliberations will be carried out on the constitutional supplementary law, the labor standards law, and the budget proposal for next year, as well as discussions on various measures to adapt to the new constitution. Thus, the Japanese misjudgment has entered another stage.</p>
<h3>Economic Controls Fail: Siam醞醸醞釀Political Upheaval: Former Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong to Make a Comeback</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Bangkok, 24th dispatch] Political figures here in Siam recently said that the latent turmoil among Siamese parliamentarians may trigger a serious political upheaval. This unrest is caused by the high degree of restrictions on commercial life and the control of food supplies. The crisis first broke out in the government itself, and then spread to various parties. However, well-informed sources here are particularly reserved about changes in the government's lineup and its policies. It is generally expected that if a political upheaval occurs, former Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong, the leader of the Democratic Party, will be able to take on the arduous task. Khuang Aphaiwong previously resigned as Prime Minister because the Parliament passed the economic control bill. He is currently in the United States and is said to be returning to Siam in the near future.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Son Arrives in England to Talk About His Meeting with Stalin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 24th dispatch] Oliver Roosevelt, son of the late U.S. President Roosevelt, and his wife arrived here by plane from Moscow today after a recent trip to the Soviet Union. Mrs. Roosevelt said as she stepped off the plane that Marshal Stalin was in good health. The son and his wife then flew back to New York. Before leaving, he told the press that they had made extensive trips in the Soviet Union this time and had been granted special permission to visit everything freely. Roosevelt's son said that they had traveled hundreds of miles by plane, Jeep, and even horse-drawn carriage, and had visited various cities, including Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalin's hometown of Gori. When reporters asked Roosevelt's son how he got to see Marshal Stalin, it was said that "it was done in the usual way." Reporters also asked the son to comment on Britain's plan to erect a statue of his father in London. The son said that he did not want to participate in the debate about whether the statue should be sitting or standing, but that the original intention of building the statue was a great honor.</p>
<h3>US Industrial Production Value Has Made Significant Progress</h3>
<p>The future depends on the labor situation</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 25th dispatch] President Truman announced today that production after the recovery of U.S. industry has increased by at least 50% compared to the average production in 1930, and in the past six months, it has repeatedly set new production records for peacetime. Former Director of the Private Production Business Administration, Small, said in a report submitted to President Truman that labor and management must cooperate to avoid strikes from happening again, otherwise the good results obtained in post-war production and employment will be lost. In fact, the current number of employed people in the United States has reached its peak, between 57 million and 58 million people, a record unprecedented in American history. This number is 14 million more than the number of employed people during the war in 1939.</p>

<h3>Christmas Eve: A Heartfelt Appeal</h3>
<p>The Pope said: The Church is like a compassionate mother, with mercy as its divine duty. To promote human sympathy and mutual assistance, there are things that must be said...</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vatican City, 24th] Pope Pius XII broadcast to the people of the world on Christmas Eve, earnestly appealing to leaders of all nations to strive to achieve a just peace. He asked the victorious nations to abandon selfish concepts and consider the needs of the majority of people, especially the youth. The Pope pointed out that the rift between the victorious and defeated nations was more profound than after any previous war. To this day, the consequences of victory and their impact remain a source of pain. Human love and the Catholic Church cannot stand idly by in the face of such phenomena. From the Church's perspective, it only seeks to guide people towards eternal salvation and has no intention of interfering with or participating in world disputes. The Church is like a compassionate mother, with mercy as its divine duty. Now, to promote human sympathy and mutual assistance, there are things that must be said. Remembering the initial creation of the Atlantic Charter, the people of the world were overjoyed. However, to this day, the various difficulties in establishing peace have not been overcome. It is deeply hoped that the leaders of all nations will exert their great power to establish a just peace and accomplish this great task. None of us can say that the world's problems have already been clearly resolved. How to deal with unprecedented new weapons has been discussed in conference sessions, but they may still prevent the future peace treaty from being entirely satisfactory. Therefore, the Church's appeal is truly necessary in the current environment. The Church is not afraid of the current anti-religious surge in various places. It is our duty to speak out for justice. I express my deep concern and sympathy for the suffering of the people in war-torn countries. In April, I already urged other national governments and people to provide assistance. Since then, people with humanitarian and Christian spirit have responded enthusiastically, allowing the glory of humanity to be further promoted. However, because the disaster area is vast, the aid is still insufficient. Therefore, it is hoped that those with spare resources will actively save the suffering and starving people, especially children and youth facing famine, regardless of boundaries or nationalities, and do their best to provide aid, so that the concepts of revenge and competition can be thoroughly eliminated, and a Christian world of great harmony can be rebuilt in the shattered civilization.</p>
<h3>Truman's Address</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] President Truman, in his Christmas address to the American people, stated: We have completed a good starting point for the establishment of world peace. However, there remains the significant task of safeguarding world peace in the future. The world today seems to lack harmony and compromise. We now know that it is easier for humanity to share adversity than to share prosperity. But if we cannot maintain peace, then the lives of soldiers are truly sacrificed in vain. The problems faced by the United Nations organization are daunting, but as we continue to strive for peace, we should not forget that the world was not built in a day. Fortunately, this Christmas, the overall situation is improving, which should be encouraging.</p>
<h3>Beneš's Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 24th] Czech President Dr. Beneš, in his Christmas Eve broadcast to the nation, expressed his belief that there would be no more world wars in this generation. He pointed out that the global situation before Christmas showed that the friendship between major leading countries was increasingly strengthened, and the foundation of peace was increasingly consolidated. The world is now eagerly awaiting the completion of the German peace treaty. Germany itself must repent for its past and implement spiritual peace and democracy to prove its determination to correct its mistakes.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Tragedy in Dense Fog: Three Passenger Planes Crash on the Same Night. One of the China National Aviation Corporation planes from Chongqing crashes and burns in Longhua. Nearly all 29 passengers and crew members perish.</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the weather in this city was exceptionally bad. Dense rain and fog covered the Longhua Airport, obscuring the ground. As a result, yesterday evening, two China National Aviation Corporation passenger planes arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing were unable to land and crashed at the airport and in Huadi, Pudong, respectively, resulting in heavy casualties. Another Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing managed to land near Jiangwan Airport, which was a better outcome.</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday, two China National Aviation Corporation passenger planes took off from Chongqing to come to Shanghai. One was a C-47 model, number 140, flown by American pilot Greenwood, co-pilot Mr. Liu (L.S. Liu), and radio operator Mr. Jin (K. King), which took off from the Coral Dam Battlefield in Chongqing. The other was a C-46 model, number 115, flown by American pilot Prdus, co-pilot Mr. Tan (H.C. Tan), and radio operator Mr. Wang (S.T. Wang), which took off from Baishi, Chongqing.</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM, the two planes stopped in Hankou one after the other, then continued flying to Shanghai. When passing Nanjing, due to the extremely bad weather in Nanjing, they did not land and flew directly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Plane number 140 first arrived in the Shanghai airspace around 5:00 PM. Due to the dense fog, it was unable to land. Although it repeatedly contacted the airport's radio control tower, reporting that it could not determine the direction of the runway, there was ultimately no way to land. Therefore, plane number 140 circled in the air for two and eleven-twelfths hours. At 7:55 PM, the plane was directly above the airport. Its fuel ran out, and it immediately lost its flying ability. The nose of the plane suddenly tilted downward and crashed directly into the ground. Initially, the sound of the engine was barely audible, then a sharp, ear-piercing sound cut through the night sky as it plunged towards the ground. In an instant, with a loud crash, the plane crashed and burned at the airport. At that time, a small fire started. Airport personnel were urgently preparing rescue measures and had already called two fire trucks and two ambulances from the fire department, which had arrived on the scene to wait. At this time, they rushed to the crash site for emergency rescue.</p>
<p>Our newspaper reporter obtained news of the accident within ten minutes after the plane crashed and immediately rushed to Longhua Airport to investigate. The plane crashed about ten yards to the side of the north-south runway, only two or three hundred yards south of the South Huangpu River. The tail of the plane faced northwest. The section from the middle of the fuselage, the door, five feet up, to the nose, was completely shattered. The wings flew more than ten yards away, separated from the body. The tail was raised and also broken, indicating the intensity of the impact. Within a range of more than ten storefronts near the crash site, there were dead male and female passengers and broken clothing ejected from the plane. Using the light of a flashlight, the reporter witnessed the body of a woman in her twenties, dressed beautifully, lying face down in the mud five feet from the plane door.</p>
<p>It was later confirmed that there were 26 passengers on the plane. Thirteen people died at the scene. The remaining thirteen people (nine men, four women) were rushed to Zhongshan Hospital, where six died on the way. Only seven people were actually treated urgently by the hospital. The reporter went to the hospital to inquire. According to the doctor, after surgery, it was confirmed that two were in critical condition, four were in uncertain condition, and only one had a good chance of survival. Among the above people, four were women, one dead, one in critical condition, and two in uncertain condition. The company was still inquiring with Chongqing for the list of dead and injured passengers, so it could not be clarified by the time of writing. According to the reporter's observation, the only person who was slightly injured had a severely swollen face, was bandaged, and was mumbling incoherently, and what he said was mostly unreliable.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the main pilot died from a ruptured brain, and the co-pilot had a pierced intestine and abdomen and could not be saved. Only the radio operator, Mr. Jin, was sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>The Second Passenger Plane Crashes in Quick Succession</p>
<p>When plane number 140 crashed, plane number 115 was still circling in the sky and was also unable to land. The reporter, driving to the entrance of the airport, saw the plane suddenly fly from south to north, across the sky, only about two hundred feet above the ground. This was around 9:10 PM. From then on, the airport no longer heard any news of it. China National Aviation Corporation personnel later received a report that plane number 115 had also crashed in Pudong at 9:30 PM. They immediately sent personnel to search everywhere. The US Navy and the Water Police Bureau also dispatched ships to assist in the search. However, its wreckage had not been found by midnight.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's inquiry with the guards on the south bank of the Huangpu River and the gatekeeper of the Shanghai Cement Factory, they saw the plane flying low from the northeast towards the southwest, and then heard a loud bang, but did not see any fire. The general location was five or six miles south of the Taishan Cement Factory in Pudong.</p>
<p>The Central Air Transport Corporation plane was also forced</p>
<p>As for a Central Air Transport Corporation passenger plane, after being warned by the control tower, it flew to Jiangwan Airport and was finally forced to land near the Wenzaobang River. At that time, a civilian house was destroyed, killing a woman and injuring three people in the house. The names of the injured were Zhang Lushi, 46 years old, Zhang Yubao, 11 years old (female), and Zhang Xinde, 14 years old (female), all with serious head injuries.

<p>According to a message released yesterday by the Public Education Personnel Supplies Distribution Center in this city, more than 40,000 yards of Melton cloth and more than 10,000 yards of uniform cloth have been sold, all supplied by the China Textile Company.

Repeated requests were made to the China Textile Company for replacements, and more than 5,000 yards of returned goods were sent to the China Textile Company for inspection and acceptance. Recently, the company has been rushing to allocate cloth materials to public education personnel in Beijing, so the new goods have not been delivered as quickly as possible.

<h3>Preparing to Commemorate Dai Tianfang, Who Devoted His Life to Dental Education and Tragically Died in a Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Dai Tianfang, courtesy name Shugu, was from Neijiang, Sichuan. He died in a plane crash in Changxing on the 14th while traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai on official business with the Central Aircraft Company. Dai had profound knowledge and was one of the few dental experts in our country. After graduating from West China University in 1934, he served as the director of the dental department of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital, which was sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. After the outbreak of the war, he served in a hospital in Guangxi Province under the Ministry of Health. In 1940, he went to the United States to specialize in public oral hygiene. In 1942, he returned to China and served as the vice president of the School of Dentistry of West China University and the director of the Oral Hospital.

<h3>American Merchant Ship Damages Underwater Cable, Power Supply to Pudong Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>At 2:10 PM yesterday, the American merchant ship StagHound, at the Shipaotai area in Nanshi, its anchor hooked the 33,000-volt underwater cable when raising anchor, causing the cable to be damaged, the iron tower bent, and the joint broken. The entire Pudong area immediately lost power, also affecting the Shanghai Ding switch, causing the current in Zhabei and Nanshi to be interrupted at the same time. The relevant electrical companies rushed to repair the switch in West Shanghai, and Zhabei and Nanshi were restored to power one after another. However, the cable in Pudong was severely damaged, and it took time to repair, so the power supply to the entire area could not be temporarily supplied. The motors used by the factory must be temporarily suspended. It is reported that there are still two cables connecting the Pudong Electrical Company and Shanghai Tongdian, one at 6,600 volts and one at 500 volts, which can be connected, but the capacity is too small and can only maintain part of the lights.</p>
<h3>Two People Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>

<h3>Two Major US Cruisers Stationed in Shanghai Host Orphaned Children. The distressed children rejected outside the gates of paradise enjoy half a day of heavenly life.</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] Christmas has passed. Although a Christmas dinner costs 100,000 yuan per person, and the tea fee in dance halls has risen to 30,000 yuan per cup, with an additional ticket charge, the entertainment venues are still full. Many privileged people indulged in merriment during this happy season, chewing on turkey, sipping champagne, and reveling until dawn!</p>
<p>Also on Christmas Eve, also in Shanghai, perhaps right in front of the dance hall doors, at the foot of the cafe walls, those forgotten wretches were enduring the torment of hunger and cold, struggling on the lifeline with their last breath!</p>
<p>Naturally, the darlings in the greenhouse would never know, who would want those ragged beggars to spoil the festive atmosphere on this auspicious occasion?</p>
<p>Enthusiastically Hosted to Spend a Wonderful Day</p>
<p>Grateful for the warmth of our Chinese friends, in the midst of excessive joy, they still did not forget the Chinese children living in hardship. The two major cruisers docked on the Huangpu River, the USS Los Angeles and the USS Helena, specially hosted 200 orphans and children from the Caohhejing Refugee Orphanage in this city and dozens of Russian refugee children for Christmas, allowing those children who had wandered the streets and been rejected outside the gates of paradise to enjoy half a day of heavenly life.</p>
<p>The US Navy's hospitality was very thoughtful. At exactly 12:00 noon, two giant landing crafts were waiting on the beach. They helped the children into the boats one by one, and then onto the cruisers. They first served them a hearty Western meal, then led them around for sightseeing, showed movies in the auditorium, and finally Santa Claus, dressed up, distributed a large number of gifts...</p>
<p>Hearty Western Meals, Candy, and Gifts</p>
<p>This day was extraordinary for those refugee children. Landing crafts, cruisers, the local specialty of Shanghai White Pagoda, SW coffee, high-quality Western cuisine, Walt Disney's cartoon movies, Santa Claus in a big red robe, candies and toys in stockings... Everything was unprecedented, and everything will forever become a miracle in their lives!</p>
<p>When the children picked up the knives and forks they had never touched before with trembling hands and ate the rich Western food, I don't know what they were thinking? Zhou Zuwang, director of the refugee orphanage, told me that he was thinking about what the children left in the orphanage were doing. It turned out that these 200 children were lucky ones who were selected by lottery. There are still more than a thousand children left in the orphanage eating black flour rations from "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to spend Christmas. At the same time, he was also thinking about how the tens of thousands of beggars who were living on the streets and drinking the northwest wind were spending Christmas?</p>
<p>When Will Santa Claus Come Again?</p>
<p>Captain Fuchili of the USS Los Angeles and Captain Bai Lu of the USS Helena were very touched by the politeness and order of the children. In addition to their enthusiastic hospitality, they also personally waved goodbye from the deck.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM in the misty drizzle, the children bid farewell to the giant cruisers. When the landing craft carried them across the Huangpu River, I believe every child who returned fully loaded would ask, "When will Santa Claus come again?" Who can give them a definite answer?</p>

<h3>Christmas Tidbits: Calendar and Picture Business Thrives; Dance Hall Tea Prices Multiply</h3>
<p>The Christmas peak has passed. The wealthy are busy preparing for the New Year, and in another half-month, they will be busy preparing for the Lunar New Year. Busy coming and going, all for the sake of celebrating the New Year and festivals. Those struggling to make ends meet are worrying about not having rice to cook, so how can they care about the New Year or festivals?</p>
<p>On Culture Street, seasonal goods such as calendars, New Year cards, and pictures are doing the best business. Newly arrived American New Year cards are exquisite and beautiful, with prices starting at one thousand yuan and going up to three thousand yuan, and buyers are enthusiastic. Picture sales are highest among wholesalers near Shanghai. The pictures still mostly use "Investiture of the Gods," "Journey to the West," and Liu, Guan, and Zhang swearing brotherhood as backgrounds, with new-style additions including atomic bomb warfare scenes. Images of beautiful women emerging from baths are sure to attract attention and cause people to stop.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at major road intersections, people were distributing leaflets printed by the Tian'an Church Christmas Celebration Preparatory Committee, which read: "Today's people are filled with golden desires. Leadership desires are stirring up hands, creating waves, using brains, manipulating events. Their mouths sing of peace, but they plan for war. The full are full, the hungry are hungry. In this unequal situation, we Christians have a report: Today is</p>
<p>Jesus's birthday. Believe in this savior who atones for people's sins and establishes the kingdom of heaven, so that you can eliminate selfish desires, be reborn with love, and enter eternal life. Otherwise, we will all perish together. If you do not believe this, consider the above. The only turning point lies in believing in Jesus, because He is love. What people lack today is love."</p>
<p>For the past two days, tea prices in dance halls have increased five or six times or more. It seems that prices will not return to their original levels before the Lunar New Year. Commemorating festivals with price increases is the best indication of Shanghai's prosperity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cold wind and rain in front of the Great World Guanshengyuan, there was a middle-aged man, dressed in thin clothes and barefoot, on the verge of death.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Reporting Traitors; High Court Has Not Received Orders</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There is a rumor that the deadline for reporting traitors is the end of this year, and that prosecutors will not accept reports after the deadline. The reporter therefore visited the responsible persons of the High Court of this city and the Procuratorate of the High Court. According to them, they have not yet received the relevant orders.</p>
<h3>Sun Youquan and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the High Procuratorate: Sun Youquan, Huang Zhaoxin, Lu Tianyou, Deng Junshan, Tao Xuesheng, Zhu Shaochen, and other six people have been indicted on suspicion of being traitors. Cui Renwei and Zhuang Ningnian, two people suspected of being traitors, have not been indicted.</p>
<h3>Sun Chunsheng Case; Witnesses Questioned</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Sun Chunsheng, the real estate tycoon during the enemy-puppet period, was further tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and witness Zhang Yifan was summoned and questioned. After the questioning was completed, the court ordered a retrial to be scheduled. The High Court also summoned Zhu Zhensheng, the former director of the puppet Qingpu County Hospital, and Cai A'gen, the former carpenter foreman of the Huasheng Tobacco Company. After interrogation, both were rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Chen Mo's Jurisdiction Error; Transferred to the District Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chen Mo, who once served as the leader of the Vanguard General Team of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army and later became a businessman, was accused of taking a folding fan used by Emperor Qianlong from the home of rebel Liang Hongzhi. After the High Court concluded its trial on the 19th, it was announced in the High Court's Criminal Division 1 yesterday morning that the case had an error in jurisdiction and was transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Prison Visit Report; The Recent Living Conditions of More Than 500 Traitors</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from This Newspaper] Amidst the rumors of a deadline for reporting traitors, let us take a look at the current living conditions of more than 500 traitors, both convicted and unconvicted, currently detained in Shanghai Prison:</p>
<p>Clothing: According to prison regulations, both convicted and unconvicted prisoners must wear prison uniforms. However, because the prison suddenly "welcomed" so many "honored guests" after the victory, there were not enough prison uniforms to distribute, so unconvicted prisoners were specially allowed to wear their own clothes. Therefore, they mostly wear suits, leather shoes, and long robes when they go to court for trial, and their families can send and exchange clothes every week.</p>
<p>Food: Each person has 20 taels of rice per day, divided into two meals. Because there are so many people, they are transported in batches to eat, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The white rice is topped with vegetables, which is called "Gaijiao Rice" in the prison, but the general "rich traitors" have their families send canned food and fresh fruits every week to replace "Gaijiao Rice," and they ignore it.</p>
<p>Living: Zhongjian is a five-story cement building with a total of 374 prison cells. Because there are more rooms than people, some people live alone in one room, and some live together in pairs. At most, each room does not exceed three people. Except for the old and weak, no one is allowed to set up beds. Those "prominent officials" who used to sleep on "Simmons" sofa beds can only taste the taste of sitting and sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Movement: Prisoners living in small iron-barred rooms consider it an unparalleled enjoyment to be able to step out of the cell and walk around every day, calling it "liberation." Prison regulations stipulate that the cells will be opened at 7:00 AM, allowing them to stroll in the corridors or patios, or chat with friends in need. The cells are closed at 11:00 AM, and they are locked back into the cells. This is repeated when the cells are opened at 1:30 PM and closed again at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The "retired gentlemen" in Zhongjian spend their days in this way of life. They are not allowed to read outside newspapers, but they also know many news. When the verdict is determined, they will move to Xiaojian, at which time they must change into prison uniforms and can only visit family members once every two weeks, and they must also work. Fortunately, the workshops in the prison are well-equipped, with printing, canning, clothing, etc. According to their work performance, they can also earn some income every month. At this time, "ministers," "governors," porters, petty officials, and thieves are all mixed together, and there is no distinction of "class."</p>
<p>The hospital in the prison is well-equipped, and there is a special rubber room for people with mental illness. The reformatory is equipped with musical instruments for cultivating their minds. There are many literati and elegant scholars among the "retired gentlemen" in Zhongjian, so there used to be an organization of calligraphy and painting clubs where they composed poems and painted and studied each other. It is said that Cai Pei and others recite Buddhist scriptures and explain scriptures in their spare time, while Yuan Ludeng, Shen Siliang, and others gather with Christians every Sunday to hold worship services. Are they expressing repentance in the iron-barred years and prison life, or are they seeking spiritual liberation?</p>
<h3>Shen Siliang Case: Four Witnesses Questioned; Each Person Spoke Favorably; College Students Were Invited to Gather Around the High Court to Listen</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, who was accused of holding a puppet position, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of treason. The preliminary hearing was held on the 15th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, four witnesses, Ni Baochun, Yang Kuanlin, Huang Jiade, and Zhang Sumin, were questioned in the Criminal Division II of the High Court. The defendant was not questioned. Many professors and students from St. John's University came to court to listen yesterday, and several foreign professors also came. The inquiry lasted more than an hour before it ended. The statements of the witnesses are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Ni Baochun</p>
<p>During his time as a professor at St. John's University, he and Shen Siliang both served as members of the Physicians' Committee. The task of the committee was to find ways to transport physicians and medical equipment to the rear to be used when the Burma Road was opened, and a contract was signed with the Southwest Transportation Office of the Military Affairs Committee in Hong Kong. A total of more than 20 doctors and more than 100 assistants were sent to the rear. After he left Shanghai and went to Kunming, Shen Siliang took over as the director of the committee until the Pacific War broke out and transportation was cut off. He also presented the original copy of the contract signed between the committee and the Southwest Transportation Office.</p>
<p>Yang Kuanlin</p>
<p>Dean of the School of Civil Engineering of the university, he stated that the defendant's assumption of a puppet position was entirely to perfunctorily deal with the enemy-puppet regime, and his purpose was purely to maintain the school. Because the Japanese were thinking of confiscating St. John's University's property, they had no choice but to falsely comply. Regarding the court's inquiry about the school hiring Japanese advisors Yoshitaka Sakamoto and Daikichi Tagawa, he stated that they were not advisors but two Japanese professors who taught economics and history courses, and never interfered in the school's administration.</p>
<p>Huang Jiade</p>
<p>Vice-Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences of the university, he stated that Shen Siliang's appointment as the president of St. John's University was due to the appointment of the school's board of directors. Most of the defendant's puppet positions were published by the enemy-puppet newspapers without consent. Because the enemy-puppet newspapers often published inaccurate news reports, he cited himself as an example. The Ta Kung Pao published that the plane crashed in Changxing and that he had died, but this was not the case. Moreover, St. John's University was considered by the enemy-puppet regime to have a long history, so all educational and cultural organizations were forced to assign a share, regardless of whether they agreed or not. Under the pressure of the enemy-puppet regime at that time, there was no other way to refuse except to close St. John's University. As for the Enemy Property Management Committee, it was to manage the property of St. John's University. Other puppet positions, except for the puppet Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, were said to be unclear. Another in-custody</p>
<p>Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>Testified that Zhang was the puppet Minister of Finance and Director of the Puppet Property Management Office. He stated that the office was entirely organized by Chinese people, and the Japanese transferred the so-called enemy-puppet property to the office for distribution. Because Shen Siliang was originally the president of the university, he handed it over to him for safekeeping, with the aim of protecting the property of the British and American churches. Shen Siliang did not have any title in the office, and no ceremony was held upon acceptance. Finally</p>
<h3>The First Case Involving Pre-War Deposits; Appeal of the Four Banks Savings Society Concluded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The first case involving the repayment of pre-war deposits, Chen Jilin's lawsuit against the Four Banks Savings Society, was judged by the District Court to be increased by a thousand times. The Four Banks Savings Society disagreed and appealed to the High Court. The lawyer representing the appellant argued two points in court: (1) The depreciation of legal tender is indeed a fact. Commodity prices have risen hundreds of times in the past year alone. If the payment must be increased due to the depreciation of legal tender, the social finance will be unimaginable. (2) The appreciation of bank real estate cannot be known for sure before liquidation. Reckless valuation is merely speculation and has no legal basis. The court announced the end of the debate, stating that the facts of the case were clear, and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Suggestions to the City Council: Improving the Treatment of Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council has received over seventy suggestions from citizens in recent days. City councilors have also submitted over ten proposals. Today, a letter was received from a citizen suggesting improvements in the treatment of prisoners. Additionally, councilors Zhou Xiangsheng, Chen Gongda, and Qu Yue proposed that bail for accused criminals should primarily be secured with reliable business guarantees, rather than solely with cash deposits, to ensure that impoverished defendants are not disadvantaged. The contents of the citizen's proposal are excerpted below:</p>
<p>A letter from Leng Jun of Wuyi Road No. 101, requesting suggestions to all levels of the court: (1) Allow prisoners' wives and friends to visit the prison once or twice a month, and permit appropriate physical intimacy. (2) The prisoners' food and lodging should be improved to ensure an adequate amount of nutrition and hygiene. (3) During their sentences, prisoners should receive knowledge enrichment, with teaching staff from municipal schools voluntarily rotating to correct the criminals' thoughts and behaviors, thereby reducing social disputes.</p>
<h3>Rubber Shoe Manufacturing and Milling Industry Reaches Settlement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The work stoppage dispute between the city's rubber shoe manufacturing and milling industry and Runfeng Rubber Industry has been resolved through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau. A settlement record was established yesterday, with the following content: (1) All twelve workers in the rubber shoe milling department will be reinstated. (2) The wages for the period of the work stoppage will be subsidized by the department itself, amounting to 100,000 yuan per worker, for a total of 1.2 million yuan. (3) All workers will resume work from December 24th.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyer</p>
<p>Hong Shi stood up and stated: The defendant's protection of the school was his mission. In the four months before the victory, the Japanese still wanted to acquire the school's assets. If the defendant had intended to collude with the enemy and puppets, the school's property would not have been so well protected. Regarding the defendant's attendance at the puppet education administration meeting, the defense counsel inquired of Yan Shibian, chairman of the school board, who replied in a letter: At that time, it was very difficult for the school not to be enslaved, not to register, and to maintain its original state. If he did not attend the puppet education administration meeting, the school would be in danger of being closed. Therefore, the defendant attended under orders. He immediately presented a certificate letter. Subsequently, the defense lawyer Mi Xitong stood up and presented two letters from graduates of the school, thanking the defendant for supporting their studies during the enemy and puppet period. He also stated: When Shanghai fell, recruiting talent to send to the rear for work was quite dangerous.</p>
<h3>Tan Yuebo Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan Acquitted</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the High Court rendered judgments on two petty treason cases: (1) Tan Yuebo, former director of the puppet tax bureaus of Taizhou and Yangzhou, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for three years, and his property confiscated according to law. (2) Xu Jinlong and Lu Zhaoyuan, accused of manufacturing military leather shoes for the enemy, were acquitted.</p>
<h3>Reporting Embezzlement in Takeovers at Any Time: The City Council Will Form Another Committee to Assist the Supervisory Office in Conducting Investigations</h3>
<p>Local city councils, believing that the investigation team's work has a short time limit and the people's grievances are difficult to address, intend to request an extension to clarify malpractices and appease public opinion. They have submitted a request to the central government for approval. Subsequently, the chairman telegraphed: "Regarding unfinished work after the conclusion of the investigation team, it has been entrusted to the supervisory offices in each district to continue. However, if people or public opinion organizations in various regions continue to discover corruption in takeovers, they can still report it to the Supervisory Office and assist in its investigation." The Qingwu City Council is now specially organizing a takeover investigation committee to assist in the continued investigation to eliminate malpractices and promote righteousness, and has requested that the city council handle it uniformly. It is understood that the City Council has already submitted this suggestion to the joint meeting of conveners for review.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Propaganda Committee Discusses Expanding Publicity Plan: First Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee Propaganda Committee held its first meeting at the City Party Headquarters on Aitang Road at 3:00 PM on the 24th. Chairman Fang Zhi was in Beijing on official business, and Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the City Party Headquarters, acted as chairman. The chairman first reported, stating briefly: After the establishment of the Winter Relief Committee, relief work has been actively launched. The task of the Propaganda Committee is to promote publicity related to winter relief work. Today's meeting is to discuss expanding the publicity plan.</p>
<p>Funds Still Need to Be Raised Continuously</p>
<p>Subsequently, He Dekui, Director-General of the Winter Relief Committee, reported on the work of the committee since its establishment, stating briefly: The relief committee's shelter has been established, located on Tongzhou Road, with a planned target of 4,000 refugees. Currently, over 700 people have been accommodated, and another 400 or more can be accommodated in the next two days. The relief funds are budgeted at 100 million yuan, of which 40 million yuan will be allocated by the municipal government. It was originally planned to request 20 million yuan in assistance from the Ministry of Social Affairs, with the remaining 40 million yuan to be raised by the fundraising committee. However, since the Ministry of Social Affairs only allocated 60 million yuan, the fundraising committee needs to raise 54 million yuan to reach the planned target. To date, only over 15 million yuan has been raised (over 6.5 million yuan from broadcast fundraising, and over 8.5 million yuan from the fundraising initiated by Du Yuesheng, chairman of the fundraising committee, through the district people's representative conferences). A shortfall of over 38 million yuan remains, which must be raised continuously. The fundraising committee is scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Yituan Hotel from the 6th to the 11th of next month. The revenue from ticket sales is expected to be 20 million yuan. As for relief work, in addition to establishing shelters, rice distribution, porridge distribution, and relief teams for the poor will also be organized. At the same time, nearly 2,000 refugees from northern Anhui have fled to Shanghai. This committee has consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan to provide each refugee with a bag of Burmese flour, which will be distributed by the Anhui Association in Shanghai, and the association will be requested to send them back to their hometowns. At the same time, this committee will also provide flour to impoverished and unemployed comrades and family members of martyrs from the Anti-Japanese War in the city as relief.</p>
<p>Advocating Thrift and Saving Refugees</p>
<p>Proposals were then discussed, and resolutions were passed as follows: (1) The Propaganda Committee will invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the shelter. The date will be decided after consultation between the shelter and the Propaganda Committee. (2) Request the assistance of various newspapers in expanding the publicity of winter relief. (3) Adopt the work outline of the Propaganda Committee and designate responsible persons for each group. (4) Send a letter to the Central Film Studio and film companies requesting them to produce films about the lives of refugees. (5) Advocate saving on New Year's gifts and banquets and dedicate special celebrations to donating funds for relief, and suggest that the Winter Relief Committee issue "Relief for Refugees, Creating Fortune Vouchers" instead of purchasing gift certificates. (6) Send a letter to the Cinema Industry Association requesting them to produce refugee relief lantern slides for screening in various cinemas.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Association to be Established Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Preparations for the Zhejiang Association in Shanghai have been completed. It is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road at 1:00 PM this afternoon to elect directors and supervisors. Additionally, [illegible] Monk will speak on the process of the Constitutional Conference, and Yu Biancheng will speak on current economic issues.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Director Zhao Discusses Year-End Bonus Issues: Profit and Loss Vary Across Industries: Demanding Precedent is Unreasonable</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Banfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with a reporter from this newspaper to answer various questions related to year-end bonuses. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The year-end bonus for the city's six major public utilities has been determined to be one month's salary, and the labor force accepts this without issue. (2) The year-end bonus issue for the silk industry involves 40 factories and over 10,000 workers. Initially, the labor side requested a year-end bonus of two months, which the management side was unwilling to consider at all. After efforts by the Labor Affairs Office, the labor side conceded to the 28th, and the management side conceded to the 6th. Because the profit and loss situations of the various silk mills are different, Zhao suggested that those with surpluses assist those with losses to enable them to bear the minimum reasonable year-end bonus. This matter is still being handled. (3) If profitable businesses voluntarily issue year-end bonuses of more than one month's salary without labor disputes, the Social Affairs Bureau can ignore them. Zhao believes that the profit and loss situations of various industries are very different, and demanding precedent is unreasonable. He believes that the double-salary method is quite reasonable.</p>
<h3>Pudong Land Administration Embezzlement Case: Two Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After inquiries by city councilors Tao Baichuan and others in the first session of the City Council regarding the Pudong High [illegible] District Land Administration embezzlement case, the case was investigated by the District Attorney's Office. It has been over two months since the investigation began. It is now known that Zhou Songqian, the main suspect in the case, who falsely claimed to be a "people's representative" and contacted the Land Administration Bureau to handle the return of civilian land forcibly confiscated by the enemy's Hengchan Company, taking the opportunity to defraud villagers of tens of millions of yuan, and another suspect, Ling Ansheng, have been arrested and detained by the District Attorney's Office. Therefore, the case is expected to have new developments in the near future. It is also learned that former Shanghai Land Administration Bureau Director Chen Shiquan will be subpoenaed to testify in court if necessary.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Believing False Accusations</p>
<p>Meimeng Zhuang asks: At the age of eighteen, Bo Ren left home to become independent because he could not endure the harsh treatment of his stepmother. Later, longing for home, he returned to the family, but unexpectedly, his stepmother's old habits returned, and he could not live in peace. Therefore, he recently left again. My father is weak by nature and believes his wife's words, claiming that he will publish a statement in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship. Although I did not obtain parental consent before leaving, I later sent a letter to my parents to express my apology and explain the reasons. I have not slandered the family at all. Moreover, I only took personal belongings when I left and did not take any household items. Is this statement valid? How should I deal with it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] The father-son relationship is a direct bloodline and cannot be severed by law. If a statement is published in the newspaper severing the father-son relationship, it is naturally invalid by law.</p>
<p>(2) Analyzing Inheritance</p>
<p>Wu Mao asks: (1) A marries B and has A. After B dies, A remarries C and has B. Now both A and B are adults, and A is also dead. Is C the legal representative of A and the legal guardian of A and B? (2) Does C have the full authority to inherit or dispose of A's estate alone? (3) When analyzing the estate, can C and A and B divide the estate into three parts? After C dies, is the estate inherited by B? Does A have the right to intervene?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) A is already dead, and his widow C cannot be A's legal representative. A, the son of A's former wife B, and B, the son of A's second wife, C, are both adults and do not need C to be their legal representative. or guardian (the so-called legal protector in the letter is probably the meaning of guardian). (2) C cannot explore to inherit or dispose of A's entire estate alone. (3) A's estate. It should be divided into three parts, with C, A, and B each receiving one share. How C and her son B dispose of the property they obtained has nothing to do with A.</p>
<h3>Tracking Down Missing Persons</h3>
<p>Looking for Lu Changhui: My younger brother, Lu Changzeng, also known as Lu Changzhen, is 21 years old and from Nanxiang, Jiading. After August 13th, he withdrew westward with the National Army and was stationed in Hengyang and Shaoyang in Hunan Province. Since receiving a letter in November 1943, there has been no news.

<h3>Dangerous Turbulence in the Financial Market: Newly Established Banks and Firms Bear the Brunt</h3>
<p>Central Bank Authorities Express Opinions</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, the financial market has been turbulent, especially the gold market, which has seen a sharp rise. However, as the Central Bank repeatedly sold [illegible] to stabilize the market, the market price finally collapsed, falling sharply again yesterday. Speculators were the first to be hit. As a result, the head offices of several newly established banks and money shops suddenly became tight. Especially those with more credit accounts or more customers suffered a sudden blow, and unstable phenomena occurred. There were as many as six rumors yesterday. Afterwards, they tried to make up for it or reorganize. The reporter specially visited Gao Yuesheng, Deputy Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, and asked him about the Central Bank's views on this matter. [illegible] said: The business operations of the financial industry in this city have always been directly [illegible] by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. The Central Bank is also extremely concerned about the unstable phenomena in the financial industry. However, most of the new [illegible] banks and firms are branch offices in the interior. The regulations of the Ministry of Finance stipulate that if a bank or firm in the interior has been established for more than four years and its business operations are stable, it may establish branch offices elsewhere. It has been found that there are quite a few banks and firms in the interior that meet the requirements of the regulations. Therefore, a large number of new banks and firms have recently appeared in the Shanghai market. It has been found that many of these banks and firms often lack sufficient funds. Often, a start-up fee has already [illegible] all the funds, and they still need to bear some debts. [Illegible] many of these banks and firms are operated by laymen. They lack a comprehensive plan for banking business operations. Furthermore, banks and firms in this city usually rely on interbank lending to regulate their own head office surpluses and deficits. Once the financial market fluctuates, all banks and firms will shrink their head offices to maintain their own strength. Banks and firms that rely on interbank lending on a regular basis will inevitably experience fluctuations when they suddenly lose their support. Furthermore, it has been found that 19 out of 10 of the current deposits in banks and firms are demand deposits, which are extremely nervous and volatile. When the market fluctuates, these deposits become floating capital, flowing into the market [illegible] gold and U.S. dollars. Therefore, banks and firms with less qualifications, who usually rely on these demand deposits to allocate their head offices, are easily stranded at this point. The most [illegible] example is that in the past, each bank's [illegible] head office in the clearing house occasionally had insufficient funds and had to wait to be replenished, which was only tens of millions of yuan per day. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for the difference to reach 200 to 300 million yuan. Therefore, he hopes that after this wave of fluctuations, the financial sector should take a more stable approach as its guiding principle for future business operations.</p>
<p>It is also reported that as the end of the year approaches and the gold rush is encountered, speculators are fanning the flames. Some have made huge profits, but there are also many who have lost their balance and been dragged into the vortex and overturned. After Chengdai Silver Shop suspended exchange, Shunli Silver Shop announced its liquidation yesterday. In addition, five emerging banks experienced tense phenomena yesterday due to the sluggish turnover of their head offices. There were many rumors in the market about the grounding of the above banks. Therefore, the major [illegible] banks and firms are adopting a cautious attitude towards the allocation of their head offices. In addition, the Central Bank has been selling large amounts of gold in recent days, absorbing nearly 100 billion yuan in head offices, and the silver root in the market has suddenly tightened. The dark interest rate has been raised to 20%, but it is still difficult to borrow cash. Therefore, it is generally expected that in the situation of extremely tight silver roots, the price of gold will be difficult to be optimistic, and other prices will gradually return to parity.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending Rate as High as 30% or More: Gold and Currency Market Prices Continue to Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, [illegible] suffered a general decline in the financial sector, continuing to plunge. It opened at 3.4 million in the morning, and after opening, it rose slightly to 3.43 million. Soon, those who lacked orders from silver and money shops came to sell, and the downward trend started again, breaking the 3.4 million mark. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 40 bars at a price of 3.36 million, and people became even more panicked. Unstable news spread frequently, and it broke the 3.3 million mark. The news of the bankruptcy of a certain bank made the selling even more like adding fuel to the fire, without end. At noon, it even fell below 3.15 million, and then it stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, there were spot exchanges who were willing to sell at reduced prices, seeing a low price of 3.08 million. Deferred delivery opened from 3.17, gradually rose to 3.29 million, and was finally lowered to around 3.2 million. As a result, it fell another 230,000 compared to the previous closing. Jewelry gold was 345,000, and silver dollars also fell. The ordinary dark exchange rate was around 20%, and the head office on the day was even raised to over 30%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were also dragged down. Small U.S. dollars opened at 6,700 yuan in the morning and sold out, and then fell with the price of gold, falling below 6,200 yuan at noon. The afternoon was slightly stable, hovering between 6,200 yuan and 6,400 yuan. As a result, it fell another 400 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong dollars [illegible] was sluggish, starting at 1,350 yuan and falling to below 1,25 yuan. As a result, it also fell 120 yuan. Due to the Christmas holiday in Hong Kong, operators were only willing to supply at 1,300 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 1,480 yuan, and British exchange rate was 20,800 yuan. All were selling prices, and no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds still had [illegible] support, and miscellaneous brands were slightly [illegible]. The unified Series C opened at 1,390 yuan in the morning, and 360 houses came to sell, falling to as low as 1,330 yuan. Later, because 552 houses had replenishment, it rose back to 1,460 yuan, and then turned [illegible]. As a result, it rose 30 yuan each for Series A, B, and C compared to the previous closing. The unified Series D fell 50 yuan, and the unified Series E fell 100 yuan. The transaction was 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Five Securities Firms Illegally Trading: Ordered to Suspend Business After Investigation</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is actively cracking down on illegal transactions outside the stock exchange. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau, according to a letter from the Securities Exchange Supervisory Officer, stated that in this city, Cuifeng, Bingji, Yi Er Tai, Xinhua, Taifeng and other securities firms, as well as Bao Cheng Yarn Firm, were illegally trading outside the market. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel to the police station to investigate and inspect the account books and trading situation. It was found that Taifeng, Cuifeng, Bingji, San Tai, Xinhua and other firms did indeed engage in illegal trading activities. Yesterday, they were ordered to suspend business, and the Public Utilities Bureau was notified to remove their telephones. All securities firms were instructed to make a guarantee to the Social Affairs Bureau that they would no longer engage in illegal transactions in the future. As for Bao Cheng Yarn Firm, it was found that there was no illegal trading activity, and the Social Affairs Bureau only asked it to sign a guarantee [illegible].</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was affected by the sharp drop in gold prices, and the customer base was weak. People in the industry were eager to supply, and the allocated yarn from product factories was sold at reduced prices. Therefore, 20 count yarn fell another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Double-strand yarn was in low demand and became even more sluggish, falling 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Second Phase of Southern Transportation Ends at the End of the Month</p>
<p>It is learned that the second phase of Southern Transportation yarn and cloth began registration this month. As of the morning of the 24th, about 40 manufacturers had been approved, totaling 3,857 pieces of cotton yarn and 49,488 bolts of cloth. The total amount of yarn and cloth approved for Southern Transportation by the Textile Control Commission for this phase is 5,800 and another piece for cotton yarn and 125,492 bolts for cotton cloth. It is heard that the association will approve the total amount of yarn and cloth for Southern Transportation applied for by various manufacturers in this phase at the end of this month. If the total amount of yarn and cloth approved for Southern Transportation in this phase still has a surplus when the deadline is reached, it will be [illegible] combined with the third phase.</p>
<p>The Price of the Fourth Phase of Allocated Yarn Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of cotton yarn for the fourth allocation to the replica industry in the fourth phase, textile factories have the intention of adjusting, but the Textile Control Commission has not reviewed it, so the allocation price must still maintain the old price and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>20 Count Double-Strand Yarn Resumes Listing</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Corporation uses 20 count double-strand [illegible] thread as the main raw material for [illegible] sailing industry. Since the joint allocation of yarn, this yarn has not been allocated. Now, in order to restore [illegible], it is specifically included, and its price is increased by 12.5% ​​according to 20 count single yarn, which is 1.965 million yuan per piece, and it has been notified to the replica cotton yarn distribution association to notify all colleagues since the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Viscose Rayon: Few Applicants for the Fourth Allocation</h3>
<p>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association previously applied to the China Trust Bureau for approval to allocate viscose rayon blended [illegible] finished products as needed by various colleagues. After the Bureau approved it, each allocated household was issued an application card, and it was distributed four times a month. The association handled all the procedures for payment and application each time. It is learned that the fourth sale of this month is scheduled to open on the 27th. The deadline for payment by various colleagues is limited to noon on the 26th. Those who [illegible] do not pay on time will be deemed to have voluntarily given up. Currently, 19 companies, including Xinhua Public, have sent their registration cards to the association. There are still 46 companies that have not sent them. The association has notified various colleagues. According to the person in charge of the company, the end of the year is approaching, and colleagues have sluggish capital turnover, so those who have not sent them are probably unable to pay.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Falls Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as Taiwan sugar began to be available for delivery, the spot supply increased suddenly, and the price dropped sharply. The association divided the spot price of medium-grained white sugar to 138,000 to 139,000 yuan, the warehouse receipt to 135,000 to 136,000 yuan, the raw red sugar to 130,000 yuan to 129,000 yuan, and the October warehouse receipt to 170,000 yuan to 167,000 yuan. The spot prices of all fell by more than 20,000 yuan. Guangbang's [illegible] also fell by 10,000 yuan, to 123,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan, with more than 200 bags opened. Shantou’s [illegible] 125,000 yuan, with dozens of bags sold.</p>
<h3>Sugar Review Meeting Resolves: The Negotiated Price of Sugar Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sugar Review Meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. There were three important decisions: (1) The negotiated price of sugar remains unchanged, that is, 130,000 yuan per [illegible] for medium-grained sugar and 110,000 yuan per [illegible] for raw sugar. (2) In order to regulate supply and demand, it is stipulated that all [illegible] who buy raw sugar must also [illegible] buy an equal amount of medium-grained sugar; however, those who only buy medium-grained sugar do not need to buy raw sugar at the same time. (3) In the first sale of sugar, the remaining [illegible] certificates and insufficient sugar certificates in each district were uniformly distributed by the Civil Affairs Office. Now, because the procedures are too cumbersome, it has been decided to [illegible] change the method; that is, those with [illegible] certificates will be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau by the Civil Affairs Office for cancellation. Furthermore, the price of sugar fluctuated once last week. In order to [illegible] lower the market price, Taiwan [illegible] Company specially increased the 28th issue of sales, which included: 28,500 bags of medium-grained sugar, 650 bags of [illegible] sugar, 3,300 bags of car white refined sugar, 2,000 bags of car white honey sugar, 20,350 bags of raw sugar, and 700 bags of red sugar. A total of 55,500 bags. Compared with the 17,550 bags in the 27th issue, it exceeded a lot, and the price of sugar became stable again.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Encounter Another Predicament; Market Engulfed in a Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere of terror surrounding Chinese stocks intensified, and the market showed no signs of recovery, plunging relentlessly. The morning's opening prices were already low, with numbers 199, 215, 142, 122, and 61 failing to sell. Tih Yung Yarn even dropped to below 625 yuan. Later, the gold market stabilized slightly, and numbers 76, 224, 145, 4, 154, and 47 advanced, once recovering to 657 yuan. After 10:15 AM, the gold market weakened again, and numbers 89, 83, 85, 229, 99, and 61 were sold off. Numbers 232 and 198 saw some mid-course buying, but the gold price continued to decline. It was reported that a certain bank had lost 1 billion yuan and gone bankrupt. Numbers 229, 233, 83, and 154 were sold off again, and number 99 aggressively dumped raw yarn, finally breaking the 600 yuan barrier. Currently, Chin Hsing was the first to reach its limit down. Hsin Ho, King Lun, and Mei Ya followed suit, falling to their respective limits. Investor sentiment became even more fearful, further contributing to the gold market's decline. Near noon, Tih Yung Yarn briefly saw a low of 585 yuan. After numbers 14 and 47 bought in, the noon close stabilized, with Tih Yung Yarn, King Fuh, Hsin Kwang, and Wah Yat collectively falling by about 10%. Mei Ya, Hsin Ho, and Chin Hsing fell by 50%, Tih Chiao, Yung Fuh fell by 10%, Mei Ya, Wah Tung fell by slightly more than 5%, Hsin Ho and Hsin Kwang fell by 15%. Few cold stocks were traded, with King Lun alone falling by 50%. In the afternoon session, the market immediately dropped because the gold price plummeted to below 3.1 million. Numbers 186 and 215 were both sold for Tih Yung Yarn, which fell to 575 yuan. Numbers 124 and 212 bought in, and the gold market rose, recovering to above 610 yuan. Numbers 218 and 215 were both sold, and although there was a low recovery, due to numbers 177, 224, and 169 being sold off, it rose again to 616 yuan. However, the gold market fell again, and numbers 145, 89, 229, 99, 16, and 171 were successively sold. Tih Yung Yarn retreated again to around 580 yuan. Number 76 bought in near the close, and stabilized slightly after the low. As a result, compared to the previous close, Tih Yung Yarn and Hsin Ho fell by slightly more than 10%, Mei Ya, King Fuh, Chin Hsing and Hsin Kwang each fell by 15%, Wah Tung fell by slightly more than 5%, and cold stocks saw little trading. Very few transactions occurred for traded stocks, An Erh fell by a little less than 20%, King Lun fell by a little less than 50%, Dah Tung rose slightly, and the rest suffered setbacks. Tih Chiao Yung Yarn fell by 10%, Wah Zhuan fell by slightly more than 5%, and the rest fell by a little less than 15%. Off-market stocks also saw some decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to decline yesterday, but investors provided some support at lower prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yi Sha, Ying Lien, and Hui De each fell by a little less than 10%, while the rest fell by around 5%.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Can Only Last for One Month at Most; Silk Reeling Industry Will Shut Down Entirely; Hoping for Government Loans and Subsidies to Seek Swift Relief</h3>
<p>Chu Fu-cheng, Chairman of the Silk Reeling Industry Association, met with reporters yesterday and stated: (1) The association has more than 150 members in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. However, currently, fewer than 50 members are officially operating, and the raw materials of each factory can only last for one month at most. They will all shut down around the end of the lunar year, waiting for the new cocoons to be available in May of next year before they can resume operations. This is the main threat to the current weaving industry. (2) During this trip to Nanjing, he had the opportunity to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who verbally promised that in addition to providing general relief, he also intended to include a subsidy for the silk reeling industry in the government budget for the coming year. This is because the export of silk is closely related to the government's foreign exchange and the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. Currently, Chinese silk in the U.S. market must suffer a loss of one-third per dan (unit of weight) due to competition with cheap Japanese goods. Therefore, if the government does not provide subsidies, the entire silk reeling industry will collapse. (3) Regarding the government's relief for the silk reeling industry, the Executive Yuan has ordered the China Silk Company and the Central Bank to negotiate an increase in the purchase price of autumn silk. A final decision has not yet been made, but it is around 60,000 yuan per dan. The China Silk Company has already allocated the last batch of autumn cocoons to various factories for contract reeling in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. As for loan issues, in addition to the already established reeling worker loans, which are loaned at 1.4 million yuan per dan, loans for machinery and equipment, with each reeling machine as collateral, are loaned at 2 million yuan and are still under negotiation. (4) The prosperity or decline of the silk reeling industry is of great importance to the entire national economy. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government can start by improving silkworm varieties and cocoon quality, and assisting various silk factories in purchasing the latest mechanical equipment in large quantities. This is because Japan can reel one dan of silk from 300 catties (unit of weight) of cocoons, while Chinese native cocoons require 600 catties to reel one dan of silk. At the same time, thorough improvement of mechanical equipment can not only increase the amount of vertical silk and improve silk quality, but also reduce the cost of silk reeling. Only in this way can it compete with Japanese silk in the international market, and only in this way can the entire silk reeling industry be thoroughly improved.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Plan to Petition Again, Requesting Government to Purchase Tea</h3>
<p>The tea merchants in the city, in view of the imminent end of the year and the government's measures for purchasing tea not yet announced or implemented, are currently discussing emergency relief measures. They unanimously decided to send representatives to Nanjing again to petition. The delegation will consist of 21 people, with representatives from all tea-producing areas in the country participating, and led by Yu Jing, the former general manager of the China Tea Company. It is reported that various parties are separately discussing the date of the trip to Nanjing. According to semi-official sources, the Central Trust Bureau has determined the principles for purchasing tea, starting with green tea for the time being. Of which, Tunlu accounts for 70% and Ping Shui green tea accounts for 30%. The standards for purchasing tea are currently under study.</p>
<h3>Misfortune of Import Industry; Foreign Goods Ordered Previously Cannot Be Imported Within the Deadline; Requesting the Transportation Control Committee to Accommodate</h3>
<p>The city's import and export commercial association, since the "Provisional Measures for Import Trade" were implemented, has found that all its members' orders for foreign goods, due to insufficient preparation in advance and no way to remedy it afterward, are in dire straits. Therefore, regarding the goods ordered before the announcement of the revised measures on the 17th of last month, the Transportation Control Committee notified all merchants to ship all goods to the port by the end of February next year. Upon hearing this news, the merchants were greatly alarmed. According to Zhou Jingwei, the secretary of the association, a portion of the goods ordered by the members are piled up at the docks of foreign countries and are currently waiting to be loaded onto ships. Another portion is still at various inland ports in the United States. Due to the lengthy U.S. maritime workers' strike, the docks and warehouses are full of goods ordered by various countries and cannot accommodate any more. Although maritime transport has now resumed, it will still take several months to transport all these goods. The goods that have not yet arrived at the coastal docks are even more problematic. The Transportation Control Committee's deadline of the end of February to ship them to Shanghai is, in fact, impossible. In addition to continuing to convene meetings of various members to discuss, they also plan to request the Transportation Control Committee to understand the merchants' suffering and provide appropriate solutions.</p>
<h3>India Increases Spring Cotton Export Quota by One to Two and a Half Times</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The Indian government has just announced the issuance of export licenses for 500,000 bales of cotton with a staple length of 11/16 inch and below for export during the January to April period. Merchants who exported to countries other than the United States during the export period ending December 1946 will be issued additional licenses, regardless of whether they have already received them, for a quantity that is 2.5 times the amount approved by the end of this December. As for licenses to the United States, they will be issued separately for a quantity equal to that approved during the period ending 1946. In addition, the quota allocated to the United Nations for the January to April period has been set at 125,000 bales. At the recent meeting of the 5th and 6th Textile Administration Bureaus, the urgent need to increase cloth production was discussed, and the possibility of adopting a three-shift system in various central areas was also discussed.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Business Resumption Loans; Lending Begins in Burma; The Philippines and Siam Regions Are Still Under Preparation</h3>
<p>The government's business resumption loans to assist overseas Chinese in reviving their businesses abroad are being handled by the Bank of Communications in the Burma and Philippines regions, with a total loan amount of US$5 million each. It is learned that lending has already begun in Burma, while the Philippines is still under preparation. However, due to the losses suffered in Burma during the Pacific War, it has not yet recovered and society is not yet stable. Therefore, the general business recovery still requires some time. The use of loans is minimal. The amount currently loaned by the Bank of Communications in Rangoon is very small, and most of it is real estate mortgage loans. As for the Philippines, loans require certification from our consulate, which is currently being processed. According to sources at the Bank of Communications, the Philippine branch has deposited funds in anticipation of the loans and can provide them at any time. However, according to general observation, the loan limit this time is too small, with credit loans limited to US$1,000 per household and mortgages limited to US$10,000. This does not provide much benefit to large merchants. At the same time, overseas Chinese in the Philippines are relatively wealthy and can generally order goods from the U.S. on credit and borrow from foreign banks at very low interest rates. It is expected that the number of loans issued in the future will not be large. The Bank of China is handling the business resumption loan of US$2.5 million in the Vietnam region. The branch in Siam has sent personnel to prepare and is negotiating with the local authorities in that country, as well as through diplomatic channels, to overcome the obstacles of Siam's foreign exchange control. The operations in Vietnam have been relocated to Saigon due to the conflict between France and Vietnam. They will begin as soon as the situation improves slightly.</p>
<h3>National Silk Processing for Export; Establishing a Joint Venture Company</h3>
<p>Capital of 500 Million to be Established Soon</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] National silk processing for export is gradually becoming a reality. The city's silk weaving industry has decided to form a joint manufacturing and sales company with a capital of 500 million yuan. All silk mills can subscribe to shares, and national banks are welcome to invest as well. It is hoped that the company's preparations can be completed before the end of the old year. In the future, it plans to send personnel to various overseas markets to directly establish connections and not rely on foreign firms for sales. The issue of being solely responsible for profits and losses has been resolved after several consultations. The factories have agreed to bear the risks themselves, but losses are limited to 90% of the "labor cost," and sales income exceeding the agreed price will also be used as the profit of each factory.</p>
<h3>Silk Turns Weak Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was generally weak with few transactions. Artificial silk No. 120, Mount Takayama opened at 290,000 to 300,000 yuan with some transactions. The Toyo brand was trading at 420,000 yuan. There was not much change in the afternoon, falling by 140,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss persisted due to lack of supply, and No. 150 with gloss saw a high price. Jin San Ma small boxes of Li Sheng Chang were asking for 5 million yuan, six boxes were asking for 4.7 million yuan in the market. Spun silk was generally weak, grade B traded at 5.125 million yuan, and grade CD did not trade at all. Opening goods traded at 4.85 million yuan for high-end goods, more than 100,000 yuan less than the previous day. Silk goods were also weak due to the decline in raw materials. Hua Jin Crepe was asking for 750 yuan, but later only traded at 700 yuan, with no other changes.</p>
<h3>Galla Chinensis in Short Supply</h3>
<p>It is reported that Galla Chinensis is in short supply at this port. Various export firms are directly purchasing from Hankou and transporting them to Shanghai for selection before shipping them for export. It is heard that local Shanghai product merchants are selling to export firms, with the price for delivery in Shanghai at 120,000 yuan per large package (i.e., net weight of one Sima dan), but there is an asking price with no transactions.</p>
<h3>Jin Rong Tightens Again</h3>
<p>Jin Rong's situation is similar to that in Hong Kong and Macau. The price has risen sharply, and the goods in the market have also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the high-end goods in the market opened at 310,000 yuan, and the average goods opened at 280,000 yuan to 240,000-250,000 yuan. Because the inventory is not sufficient, and the winter sales season is approaching, the situation is very tight.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tea Sales to French Territories; Negotiations Have Begun</h3>
<p>Chinese tea has always occupied a considerable position in European and American countries, especially sales to French Africa. Currently, there is a demand for Chinese tea abroad, but the selling price is not yet up to our country's production cost, so export sales are still not priced competitively. Local tea merchants, in view of the fact that Chinese tea is on the verge of extinction, have repeatedly appealed to the government for assistance, or to purchase it at cost, but so far there has been little concrete progress. It is learned that Lin Fengbao of the Central Bank's business authorities has discussed the various hardships of Chinese tea with the French commercial envoys for several months. As a result, hundreds of tons of tea, mostly premium teas such as Zhenmei, have been satisfactorily resolved. It is heard that the tea samples have now been deemed qualified, and the selling price has also been slightly increased compared to the past. It has also been designated to be shipped to various French territories in succession. Therefore, the various export firms in the city have gradually become active, but the industry is still not stable, and there is still no vitality in the domestic sales of black and green tea.</p>
<h3>Deliveries Come and Go in Succession; Cigarettes Fall in Price</h3>
<p>Cigarettes, like shipments, come and go in succession, but buyers are watching and the market situation is weak and unable to improve. Yesterday, the initial market opened softly, and then slowly declined. Ten packs of British cigarettes per box fell by 110,000 yuan again. Among them, only 20-packs of Qianmen, Taishan, and San Wang were slightly lively, and the rest declined across the board.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Moratorium on Payments; Difficult to Lift Currently; Stock Transfer Ban; May Be Partially Lifted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th] When replying to a member's question in the Legislative Council, the Colonial Affairs Minister Dodd said that the government has no intention of immediately lifting the moratorium on payments that was promulgated since Hong Kong's recovery. He said: "Regarding the issue of the moratorium and the relationship between debtors and creditors, the government cannot make further statements at this time." Although there is no immediate hope of lifting the moratorium, the possibility of canceling property transactions during the Japanese occupation period is being studied by the Colonial Affairs Bureau. Dodd continued: "Regarding the ban on stock transfers, the possibility of partially lifting it has also been suggested to the Secretary of State for approval, so that shares of companies registered by owners with the competent authorities will be allowed to be freely transferred, but shares of companies with disputes will of course not be included." Most merchants believe that the moratorium is somewhat hindering Hong Kong's economic recovery, and some parties have urged the government to lift the ban as soon as possible. Under the moratorium, all stock transactions must first be approved by the Minister of Finance, and disputes over past debts cannot be brought to court. The moratorium does not give banks the power to unfreeze pre-war accounts. The local stock exchange is still being rebuilt, and it is unlikely to resume operations until at least the ban is partially lifted.</p>
<h3>Transactions Are Slow; Coal Prices Drop</h3>
<p>Coal industry transactions were slow yesterday, buyers were watching, and the elimination of various grades of coal was sluggish. The price of white coal from Yantai frequently dropped, Tangquan lump coal dropped by 50,000 yuan, and Jiaozuo lump coal dropped sharply by 70,000 yuan. Yantai lump coal and premium lump coal, premium lump general Yantai coal, all saw small declines. Firewood charcoal briquettes did not change.</p>
<h3>Australian Trade Representative Welcomes Indian Goods to Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 24th] Mitcham, leader of the Australian trade delegation stationed in India, said: "Australian trade was previously monopolized by the Japanese, and we hope that India can restore its inherent position in the future." He assured that Australia would do its best to assist in the development of Indian trade.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Border Education Work in the Last Three Years</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper, Nanjing] The Border Education Committee held its fourth meeting in Chongqing in January of the 33rd year. In the 34th year, due to the victory and recovery, the fifth meeting was not convened. During these three years, the country once entered the most difficult era, and the border education facilities in the capital had to adapt to the situation, support themselves through hardship, and slowly seek development. Generally, before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the government, in order to cooperate with the Allied forces' counter-offensive, had urgent military needs, and border education undertakings were greatly restricted, such as the Border Administration Academy and the Lanzhou Language Training Class, which could not be established. However, border education is of great importance to national defense, and the Ministry of Education still strives to work within its available human and financial resources. In addition to the establishment of the Maritime Border School, the Lama Vocational School, and the Border Administration Department of the Central Northwest University as usual, it is also committed to improving the quality of existing schools. After the victory and recovery, border education undertakings became even more difficult. The maintenance of funding for various border schools in the rear area, the settlement of teachers' lives, the supply of teaching materials and equipment, etc., could not be interrupted, and the recovery work in the recovered areas must be advanced rapidly in coordination with the development of the new situation in the border areas. The 6th meeting will open on the 26th, and the Ministry of Education has prepared a report on the border education facilities in the past three years to be reported at the 6th meeting. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Directly Managed Enterprises (1) Science Departments and Middle Schools: In addition to the original Border School, the Ministry of Education established the Maritime Border School in the 33rd year in response to the need to recover the southeast maritime border. Recently, in response to the request of the local authorities in Xikang, it plans to change the Kangding Normal School in the province into a Normal College and is submitting a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions. In terms of middle schools, in addition to the Huangchuan and Hexi middle schools, which were once converted to border education, there is currently only one middle school in Yimeng. (2) Normal Education: There were originally ten normal schools in the border areas, three in southern Shaanxi, two each in Xikang and Gansu, and one each in Guizhou, Qinghai, Ningxia, and a normal class attached to the Yimeng Middle School. Recently, in response to the needs of the recovered areas, normal schools have been established in Rehe, Chahar, Liaobei, and Xinghua. The Tianshan Congling Normal School in Xinjiang is also in the process of preparation. The school system of the normal schools has undergone slight changes since the 34th year, and the length of study has been uniformly changed to four years. (3) Vocational Education: There are a total of eight vocational schools in the border areas, two each in Qinghai, Xikang, and Sichuan, and one each in Gansu and Ningxia. The departments are complex and mostly established according to local conditions: some focus on animal husbandry, some focus on agriculture and forestry, some focus on both agriculture and animal husbandry, some focus on textiles, and some have settings for medical affairs, veterinary medicine, and agricultural and animal husbandry production. The length of study varies from two, three, four, and five years, which is also determined by the special circumstances of the locality. In order to determine the school system of vocational schools in the border areas, the Ministry of Education has stipulated that all junior vocational schools in the border areas should be changed to a four-year system, and the curriculum standards are being drafted. (4) Primary Education: There are 17 primary schools established in Suining, Kangzang, and other places. Including the affiliated primary schools of the normal schools, there are a total of 34 schools. (5) Social Education: The Ministry of Education has always entrusted various schools to concurrently handle social education in the border areas. Each year, the Ministry allocates radios, projectors, and other equipment to allow the schools to organize mobile teaching drama troupes, etc., to conduct teaching tours in various border areas. Other promotional activities, such as running literacy schools for the masses and opening clinics, have also achieved considerable results in some schools.</p>
<p>Local Border Education (1) Various Provinces in the Rear Area: Various provinces have a considerable history of implementing border education, but in the past, they inevitably acted independently, and the manifestations were also different. In order to meet the needs of the border areas, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated a three-year plan (33rd to 35th year) for promoting border education in various border provinces. It has formulated standards for primary schools, social education, and vocational aspects, and ordered them to formulate implementation plans within the scope of possible funding and personnel, and submit them for approval. The provinces that have formulated the plans are Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xikang. Due to special circumstances, Suiyuan and Qinghai provinces have only formulated the 34th year plan. Guizhou and Guangxi provinces have reported that there is no need to implement border education separately. Xinjiang has formulated an education administration plan because almost all education in the province falls within the scope of border education. Judging from the implementation results, the various border provinces have generally made efforts in the design and implementation of border education. Among them, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xikang provinces have achieved better results due to relatively abundant funding and personnel. Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Suiyuan provinces are lagging behind. However, due to difficulties in funding and teachers, the Mongolian Banner education is simple and crude in the primary schools established by each banner, and there is much room for improvement. There are no secondary schools. The Ministry of Education has allocated border education subsidies to various border provinces over the years to encourage them. In the 34th year, the Ministry of Education subsidized the funding for public and private schools in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces, totaling 2,294,000 yuan. This year, it has increased to 13,990,400 yuan, which is directly allocated to the schools for use. (2) Various Border Provinces in the Recovered Areas: During the enemy-puppet occupation period, the Northeast and Rehe Chahar Suiyuan Mongolia regions established a large number of schools to implement slave education in order to poison our border compatriots. At the time of recovery, affected by the war, the takeover was delayed, causing education in the area to fall into a standstill. In order to encourage local schools and quickly complete the recovery work, the Ministry of Education has specially promulgated the key points of emergency measures for banner education and ordered them to be implemented, stipulating that all primary and secondary schools and social education institutions in the recovered banner areas that have had considerable visibility in the past and have no teaching difficulties in the future should be restored by the province or banner government within the scope of personnel funding permits. In terms of funding, the Headquarters has repeatedly listed regulations and granted recovery subsidies: a subsidy of 3 million yuan for a senior high school, 2 million yuan for a junior high school, and 1 million yuan for a complete elementary school (same for social education institutions), and 600,000 yuan for a primary elementary school. In terms of teachers, qualified personnel should be hired, or short-term special training should be given to existing teachers and assigned to teach in various schools. In addition, the Li education on Hainan Island in Guangdong and the Gaoshan ethnic education in Taiwan have also been ordered by the Ministry of Education to the provinces of Guangdong and Taiwan to formulate plans for promotion.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Will Return to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] Zhang Boling has decided to return to Tianjin on the 27th or 28th. Nankai is preparing a grand welcome. It is heard that after Zhang returns, he does not intend to leave Tianjin in the short term and will devote all his efforts to the school's affairs.</p>
<h3>Peking University Professors Urge Government to Improve Treatment as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Plan to Request a Subsidy of One Ton of Coal per Person</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Peiping, 25th] Because the school cannot provide coal for the cold winter, the professors of various universities in the north have formed a situation of either freezing or starving. Peking University held an administrative meeting yesterday to discuss this matter for two hours, but there was no good solution. They only urged the government to improve treatment as soon as possible and are currently requesting a subsidy of one ton of coal per person to alleviate the urgent need.</p>
<h3>Crisis in Overseas Chinese Education in Siam: Siamese Ministry of Education Orders Registration of Overseas Chinese Schools; Overseas Chinese Schools Unite in Refusal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th Dispatch] Overseas Chinese schools here have unanimously passed a resolution opposing registration with the Siamese Ministry of Education. If the Siamese authorities refuse to amend the existing education regulations promulgated by the former dictator, Luang Phibunsongkhram's government, the Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close. The Ministry of Education recently ordered all Overseas Chinese schools to register within fifteen days. Upon receiving this news, leaders of the Overseas Chinese education community convened a meeting and resolved that Overseas Chinese schools would only register after the current Siamese education regulations were amended in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Sino-Siamese Treaty. The aforementioned treaty stipulates freedom of education for Overseas Chinese children here. Under the current Siamese education regulations, Overseas Chinese teachers must pass the fourth-level Siamese language examination. Officials from Overseas Chinese schools stated that Overseas Chinese children aged seven to fourteen are only allowed five and a half hours of Chinese language classes per week, and all Chinese textbooks must be submitted to the Siamese authorities for approval and translated into Siamese. Overseas Chinese education authorities have decided to make the following requests: (1) At least twelve hours of Chinese language classes per week. (2) Overseas Chinese teachers who do not teach Siamese language classes should be exempt from the Siamese language examination. (3) There is no need to translate Chinese textbooks for approval. These requests are the same as those recently made by our embassy in Siam to the Siamese authorities for negotiating amendments to the Siamese education regulations. It is understood that if the above requests are rejected, Overseas Chinese schools are prepared to close.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Education Department Submits to Provincial Government for Approval and Allocation: 60 Million for Cultural Relics Restoration; Search and Purchase of Manuscripts and Historical Materials of Revolutionary Martyrs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th Dispatch] The Provincial Department of Education received 60 million yuan in cultural relics restoration funds from the Ministry of Education. Upon submission to the Provincial Government, it was designated for distribution as follows: 25.01 million yuan to the Guangdong Cultural Relics Museum, 5 million yuan to the Municipal Zhongshan Library, and 10 million yuan to the Provincial Library, specifically for searching and purchasing Guangya Series and important manuscript versions, historical materials related to Guangzhou, manuscripts of revolutionary martyrs, local chronicles, and other academic classics. The remaining 20 million yuan will be distributed to various counties and cities, also specifically for searching and purchasing the above-mentioned cultural relics, and may not be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Education Drafts New Education Bill</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] In order to reform the education system, the Japanese Ministry of Education has drafted five important bills, which will soon be submitted to the Diet for deliberation: (1) Basic Education Law, (2) Education Law, (3) Social Education Law, (4) Private School Corporation Law, and (5) Teacher Status Law.</p>
<h3>Children's Concert: Grand Second Day</h3>
<p>Ten Thousand Spectators, No Empty Seats</p>
<p>The children's concert organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education was held for the second day yesterday. The audience was still extremely crowded, and by shortly after 1:00 PM, there were no empty seats. It was estimated that there were no fewer than ten thousand people. Boy Scouts from the private Jinghu Middle School were present to maintain order, and a large number of inspectors dispatched by the association guided the way, so order was maintained. Yesterday, the schools participating in the Victory Grand Chorus were: Third District Center, Fifth District First Center, Fifth District Second Center, Eleventh District Center, Twelfth District Center, Fifteenth District Center, Nineteenth District Center, Xinsheng, Danhua, Feihong, Xicheng, Singapore, and eleven other schools. The schools participating in the Nation-Building Grand Chorus were: Third District Center, Fourth District Center, Fifth District First Center, Fifth District Second Center, Seventh District Center, Tenth District Second Center, Eleventh District Center, Fifteenth District Center, Nineteenth District Center, Shangwen, Singapore, Nancang, Jianchun, Xicheng, Nongtan, Qiehua, Yangzheng, Jiangjing, and eighteen other schools. The other programs were also wonderful. In particular, the doll dance of Fuchun Elementary School, the "Flying Rainbow is So Cute" performance of the Second Elementary School in the Tenth District, and the Little Soldiers' Team of the Eleventh District Center, all featured neat and beautiful costumes, melodious and bright singing, and lively and innocent movements, earning much applause. The entire program was filmed by a photographer dispatched by the Central Photography Studio to preserve the memory.</p>
<h3>Departments of Fudan University Compete to Establish Academic Lectureships</h3>
<p>Recently, students at Fudan University have shown a growing interest in academic research, which is largely due to the efforts of the Chinese Literature Department of the university. Since the literary lecture series organized by the department began, other departments have also become active. Yesterday, the university held two lectures: one by our ambassador to the Netherlands, Mr. —, on "European Problems," and another by Professor Gao Juefu of the Psychology Department on "Techniques in New Psychological Research." It is reported that next Friday afternoon, the Chinese Literature Department will invite Professors Zhang Jin and Zhou Yutong to give literary lectures, and the Political Science Department will invite Mr. Xu Weinan to speak on "Prospects for the Press." This kind of atmosphere is truly worthy of emulation by other schools.</p>

<h3>South Africa Prohibits White-Black Boxing Matches</h3>
<p>Also Applies to Joe Louis</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, 24th Dispatch] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis is planning to tour the world and will soon visit South Africa. A newspaper commented that the ban on boxing matches between white and black people should also apply to Joe Louis.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup Finals Begin</h3>
<p>Predictions of Victory for the United States and Australia</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Melbourne, 24th Dispatch] The Davis Cup finals are scheduled to begin here on the 26th. The singles lineup for the United States and Australia has been announced. On the 26th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich (Australia) vs. Schroeder (USA), and Pails (Australia) vs. Kramer (USA). On the 27th, there will be one doubles match, with the lineup yet to be announced. On the 28th, there will be two singles matches: Bromwich vs. Kramer, and Pails vs. Schroeder. Australian fans believe that the United States' selection of Kramer and Schroeder is advantageous to Australia. The US Davis Cup captain's failure to select Parker to partner with Kramer is a mistake, as Parker has experience in the Davis Cup finals, while Schroeder is a newcomer. However, there is a rationale behind the US lineup, as Schroeder defeated Pails in the semifinals of the recent Victorian Tennis Championships, but lost to Bromwich in the final. Thus, Schroeder may win one singles match in the Davis Cup, while Kramer, whose skill level is above that of Schroeder, should be able to defeat Pails, so the US may win two matches. Kramer, the US champion, is evenly matched with Bromwich, the Australian international, so the results are difficult to predict. If Kramer wins, then with three wins out of five matches, the Davis Cup would be won, so the outcome is difficult to assess.</p>

<h3>Jinan in Twenty-Four Hours</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fan Litian of This Newspaper in Jinan</p>
<p>20th Air Mail</p>
<p>After the plane landed in Jinan, the first things that caught the eye were the countless strong fortifications and bunkers around the airport. The four square kilometers of the airport, two days ago (when the Jiaoji Railway had not yet officially opened), was still the only transportation line connecting Jinan with the outside world. More than 6,000 airplanes had successively transported all levels of civil and military combatants, supplies, both material and spiritual, ensuring its safety. This allowed the isolated city, with a width of fifty kilometers and a population of 800,000, to avoid catastrophe and stand tall, even under the hard and soft attacks of the Communist army from all sides. Bearing the brunt of this most arduous task was General Zhao Ziliang, the right-hand man of Commander Wang Zuomin, the current deputy adjutant of the buffer zone.</p>
<p>Second Generals Meet and Greet, Deputy Commander Li of the Pacification Zone</p>
<p>General Zhao and General Wu Litian are both old friends of the reporter. As early as the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War on August 13th, we hit it off immediately and became the most intimate friends on the battlefield. This time, they learned that the reporter had come to Jinan. Thanks to their warm hospitality, I truly felt "at home away from home" and "meeting an old friend in a foreign land," which made the reporter deeply appreciate the warmth and depth of friendship.</p>
<p>Generals Zhao and Wu first introduced me to Deputy Commander Li Xianzhu of the Pacification Zone, Chief of Staff Luo Xingli, and Director Long Zhouyun, among other senior officials. Deputy Commander Li is a famous general from the first class of Whampoa Military Academy, one of the "Three Lis of Shandong" (the other two being Li Yannian and Li Yutang). He is tall, with a round face, bright eyes, and vigorous spirit, but his temples are slightly gray, which shows his hard work for the country during the Anti-Japanese War. He personally participated in the famous battles of Xinkou in Shanxi and Fuyang in Anhui, and wrote many glorious chapters in the history of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Deputy Army Commander Ma Talks About Whampoa Anecdotes</p>
<p>It was almost noon, and Li and others had lunch with the reporter. During the meal, we talked about the Communist army's disturbances in Shandong, and then moved on to "outwardly inept in foreign wars, inwardly adept in civil wars." Furthermore, Deputy Army Commander Ma Zhichao, who was also present, was an old member of the first class, and we talked about the interesting anecdotes when he first applied to Whampoa. He recounted frankly and candidly: At first, he felt that his level was too poor and was not sure of being admitted, so he first went to see the principal (i.e., Chairman Chiang Kai-shek) before the exam, and stated that the military academy was different from ordinary schools, and that applicants from remote provinces should be admitted more leniently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek approved his request and wrote on his report: "Approved for special admission." When the exam came, Mr. Wang Boling was the chief examiner. Before the exam, Mr. Wang first announced three rules: those who are confident in their abilities should take the exam, and those who are not capable should withdraw themselves. Cheating is strictly prohibited, and the admission standards are based on performance. Any plea for leniency will be invalid. At that time, more than ten people automatically withdrew from the examination hall and gave up the exam. At that time, Mr. Ma was not moved at all. When he came to the mathematics and science questions, Mr. Ma could not answer any of the questions and handed in a blank paper. He was deeply afraid of failing, so he had to write to Wang Boling, pleading his hardships, and then threatened: "If I am not admitted, I will only risk my life." Wang was timid, and as a result, he was indeed admitted!</p>
<p>The Big Cannon Wang Boling Scares People to Death</p>
<p>When Ma said this, he still couldn't help but feel emotional. Deputy Commander Li then added: "Wang Boling has always been known as the 'Big Cannon Wang,' but although he is called a 'Big Cannon,' he is the most timid. Wang once said to others: 'People call me a "Big Cannon," and I am indeed a "Big Cannon," but as long as I hear a cannon sound, I will be frightened!' The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Ma is good at rhetoric and humorous in nature. He also talked about when he was a regimental commander in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he and his classmate Chen Defa went to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited them to dinner, Ma was deeply afraid of staying too long, or having shortcomings that could be easily discovered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, so he immediately asked Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on what instructions he had for them to lead troops to fight. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek thought for a moment, and then said: "You two are leading troops, but Chen Defa's name alone means 'not effective.'" After Ma resigned, he greatly complained about Chen Defa, that if it wasn't for his name, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek might not have thought of this "comment." Chen is currently the commander of the Dihua Garrison, and it can be said that he has already become "effective."</p>
<p>After the meal, Deputy Commander Li and others were busy with meetings, and the reporter was invited by Deputy Director Wu of the Shandong Public Newspaper and others to visit the six newspapers, six news agencies, and six periodicals here. In addition to the Central News Agency, news agencies here, such as the Chunqiu News Agency, can also send manuscripts on a daily basis, so that the newspaper's external affairs are in a state of "no competition." The sales volume of the newspapers ranges from 3,000 to more than 10,000 copies. In Jinan, which is like a besieged city, under the circumstances that all material conditions are lacking, it truly symbolizes the hard-fought spirit of the news industry.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Works Diligently, Only Sleeps Four Hours a Day</p>
<p>At 5:00 p.m., Chairman Wang Zuomin invited me to a banquet. Since Mr. Wang took office as the chairman of the provincial government, he has been so busy that he can only sleep four hours a day, and even in these precious four hours, he is constantly disturbed by the telephone. We have been apart for six years, and the first feeling is that although Mr. Wang is diligent and hardworking, under the arduous task of tying the safety of Shandong to his own shoulders, his eyes are still bright and his physique is strong, as in the past. This shows that the prerequisites for making great achievements and achieving great undertakings are not only the combination of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, but also a strong physique, which is the prerequisite among the prerequisites. Although Chairman Wang has been entrusted with important tasks by the country today, his sincerity and earnestness in treating people, and his seriousness and meticulousness in handling affairs have not changed slightly due to his high position. During the dinner, Chairman Wang mentioned that when we first met, he was just a division commander, but the reporter for the past ten years is still just a reporter. Compared to this, how can I not be ashamed? However, Chairman Wang is still as frank and sincere as in the past, and is full of care, which is the only consolation for the reporter to be a reporter.</p>
<p>Four Dishes and a Soup, Meeting Reporters During Dinner</p>
<p>Because Chairman Wang is too busy, he can only use his dinner time to meet with reporters. The meal is four dishes and a soup. Today, because there are also ten people present, including Deputy Army Commander Li Yan, the plates and bowls are larger, and four more plates of porridge and side dishes are added. Everyone eats comfortably and practically. During the meal, Chairman Wang asked me many questions about the situation in Beijing and Shanghai, which made me have no time to ask him about the military and political situation in Shandong. At the end of the meal, Secretary-General Liu Daokang of the Provincial Government had been waiting in the meeting room for a long time, so the reporter had to reschedule to ask Chairman Wang to explain the current situation in Shandong.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's residence is the former German consulate in Jinan. When the reporter stepped into his residence in the deep night, the streets were bustling with people coming and going, and the night markets were the same as in the past. Except for the fortress at the street corner and the barbed wire fences made of iron thorns every few tens or hundreds of steps on the road, and the iron thorn wooden frames that can be electrified standing under the bright street lights, more or less revealing a bit of wartime atmosphere, the entire city of Jinan is still quietly lying at the foot of Sili Mountain and Ma'an Mountain.</p>
<p>The Jinan that I encountered in twenty-four hours was really too little. Let's use this as a wedge for future communications.</p>

<h3>Abundance by the Banks of Poyang Lake</h3>
<p>— Special Reporter Yu Ningpo of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Poyang, 6th</p>
<p>French economist Gurney said: "The wealth of a living individual, that is, the wealth of an animal body, is its blood, and the wealth of a social body is its objects." Objects refer to agricultural products, because agricultural products can be extracted from the outside world, which can increase the wealth of the social body. In other words: if a country, a province, a county, or a township has the wealth of a social body, then the economy and taxation of a country, a province, a county, or a township will have laid its source and foundation.</p>
<p>The reserves of agricultural crops in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi Province possess the conditions for the above-mentioned social wealth. Together with the five major tributaries of the Gan River, Fu River, Xiu River, Xin River, and Rao River, they can be said to be the pride of Jiangxi's production sector and the granary of the entire province's agricultural products. In the southeastern provinces, Jiangxi is known as a prosperous area, relying on Poyang Lake and the five major production areas of the Gan, Fu, Xiu, Xin, and Rao rivers as its strongest pillars.</p>
<p>Today, the reporter will make a brief report on the production and sales of the most prominent agricultural crops in the counties along Poyang Lake in northern Jiangxi this year, such as rice, indigo, sugarcane, lotus seeds, cotton, and tobacco. But when I started to write this dispatch, the great lake was deeply imprinted in my mind, containing a lot of envy - envying it for being able to nurture so many food and clothing materials that are beneficial to human life. Therefore, for each product along the lake, I specially highlight its function and purpose, not just calling it an object, so that it can be matched with the dynamic and static lake water, and further show its infinite greatness.</p>
<p>Southeastern Granary, Famine Years Do Not Hear of Empty Stomachs</p>
<p>The counties of Raohe, Changjiang, and Yuejiang in northern Jiangxi Province are located on the shores of Poyang Lake, with fertile plains and convenient irrigation, making them the most suitable areas for cultivation. As the old saying goes, "When Jiangxi is ripe, the southeast is sufficient." This is indeed true. According to the Jiangxi Tongzhi (Jiangxi General Records), in the early Qing Dynasty, there were more than 47,827,000 mu of rice fields in the entire province. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the statistics office of the Legislative Yuan estimated that there were more than 41,630,000 mu of rice fields in the entire province. The Economic Commission of the Provincial Government estimated that there were 52 million mu of farmland in the entire province, of which an average of 65% could be planted with rice. The annual yield of rice per mu, calculated by combining one to two harvests per year, can produce at least 132,158,000 shih of grain in a bumper year. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the statistics office of the provincial government, based on reports from 83 counties, totaled more than 119 million shih of early rice, middle rice, late rice, and glutinous rice. In addition to supplying the people of this province with food and sales, more than 2 million shih of rice can be left over each year, of which one-third of the surplus comes from the warehouses in the counties along Poyang Lake. According to the estimates of the Economic Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the amount of rice ceded in the counties along the lake was 2,780,000 dan in Yugan, 982,800 dan in Wannian, 1,338,750 dan in Yujiang, 418,335 dan in Xingzi, 1,514,852 dan in Duchang, 647,516 dan in Hukou, 4,466,900 dan in Poyang, 1,656,608 dan in Fuliang, 1,946,580 dan in Leping, and 756,000 dan in Dexing. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the amount of rice produced in the Raohe area was 3,309,600 dan of early rice, 997,600 dan of middle rice, 1,912,200 dan of late rice, and 277,200 shih of glutinous rice, totaling 6,496,600 shih. With one-eighth of the province's corner, the ten counties bordering the lake have so much rice production, it is truly worthy of the name of granary.</p>
<p>This year, although the early, middle, and late rice in the counties along the lake once faced the danger of being flooded by white water in the summer, most of the basic dikes did not break. After a long sunny autumn, the rice fields turned danger into safety, and the autumn harvest was generally bountiful. The harvest of Wannian rice is more than double that of a bumper year. It is estimated that the average rice production in the counties along the lake has sufficient harvest. Self-reliant farmers, they have exhausted their labor and sweat, and exchanged them for cars and warehouses full of golden rice grains, so that the men, women, old and young who live and eat here can all have full bellies and live a peaceful life of abundance and prosperity. In times of famine, the surplus can be used to make up for the deficiency. The so-called fierce year does not hear the crying of hunger, and the winter plowing will stop in a blink of an eye, which is the leisure time for them to rest. Try to look at the farmhouses on the lakeside, where three or four farmers gather on a cold night, smoking and roasting fire, and talking about sericulture and hemp, and start their fireside chats.</p>
<p>Coloring the Sky Blue, Adding Beauty to Green Robes</p>
<p>Indigo was introduced to our country from India thousands of years ago, and it is the oldest colored plant among dyes. Leping, upstream of Poyang Lake, is adjacent to the lakeshore, with a mild climate, deep soil, and non-wet clay soil, making it the most suitable area for planting indigo. Indigo belongs to a kind of blue grass, divided into Polygonum tinctorium and Isatis tinctoria. The indigo made from Polygonum tinctorium is bright and shiny at first glance, but it will turn green after a long time and gradually lose its dyeing ability. The indigo made from Isatis tinctoria looks dull and has the color of Annam. The indigo paste can remain colorfast for several years.</p>
<p>In the past, the output of Leping indigo was about 400,000 to 500,000 market stones per year, with Polygonum tinctorium accounting for one-third and Isatis tinctoria accounting for two-thirds. The total area of indigo planting in the county is 300,000 to 400,000 mu, with about 200,000 indigo farmers. The yield of indigo per mu is 1.5 to 2 market stones for Polygonum tinctorium and 2 to 3 market stones for Isatis tinctoria. Before foreign indigo invaded domestic sales, Baolan, Yuelan, and Qinglan earth cloth, which were manually woven in the mainland, were all dyed with local indigo. At that time, there were more than 70 Leping indigo dyeing workshops, with more than 100 technicians in the large ones. This was the golden age of the Leping indigo industry. Since the import and sale of foreign indigo, users have used it because of its low price and labor-saving, and the original local indigo market has become narrower and narrower. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, foreign indigo was cut off, and the demand for local indigo was revived, and it gradually rose again. Last year, the local market price per 100 catties soared from 3,000 to 4,000 to 70,000 when leaving the customs, and indigo farmers and indigo merchants all benefited greatly.</p>
<p>This year's harvest of indigo in Leping is expected to be more abundant than in previous years. Although the price has fallen in recent months, it is still hovering between 50,000 and 60,000, and there are still sales in various places such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Xun Province. Farmers who plant indigo know that the previous year's income was abundant, so they only know to give full play to the land and then wish for extravagance. Every time the indigo seedlings mature in late autumn, wooden barrels are arranged by the river, and the sound of stirring indigo is heard. They have a spirit of starting work and enjoying their careers, which is expressed in the smiles and words of every indigo farmer. The naturally beautiful blue gowns worn by the simple and unpretentious men and women in the inland rural areas are all exchanged for their strength and sweat.</p>
<p>Sweet as Honey, Symbolizing Cultural Progress</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province is an important sugar producing area in our country, and the producing areas are almost all over the province, especially the old Ganzhou and Raozhou prefectures. Leping and Dexing, upstream of Poyang Lake, have a wide area for planting sugarcane. Sugarcane is the best raw material for sugar production. In the sugarcane producing counties in the irrigation area along the lake, there are Poyang, Fuliang, Wannian, Leping, and Dexing. Among the above five counties, Leping has the richest sugarcane production. Leping sugarcane has long and sweet stalks. The sweet sugarcane produced in the Raohe area is mostly named Leping sugarcane.</p>
<p>The total planting area is 7,350 mu of sugarcane fields in Leping, 520 mu in Wannian, 1,000 mu in Poyang, 5,438 mu in Fuliang, and 4,200 mu in Dexing. The annual output of Leping is 553,000 dan, Wannian is 43,000 dan, Fuliang is 190,330 dan, Poyang is 60,000 dan, Wannian is 22,500 dan, and Zongxing is 13,400 dan. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, there were more than 70 local sugar factories in Leping and Dexing. The value of sugar exports was no less than 800,000 yuan. The annual output of sugar in Yujiang was 90,000 dan, and Wannian was 20,000 dan. The total output value of the total exports was slightly more than Leping. The produced sugar is all of the two types: red sand and dry block. Although a large amount of foreign sugar is dumped in the mainland, because of the different red and white quality and taste, red and white each have their own sales channels. During the recent Anti-Japanese War, the source of foreign sugar was cut off, and mainland users replaced it with cane sugar, and sales increased year by year, and prices also rose. Ten years ago, the market price of cane sugar per dan was only 7 or 8 yuan to 15 or 16 yuan. Last year, it had soared to 50,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, farmers in the producing areas have benefited greatly from sugar, and they are all engaged in large-scale production. The sugarcane harvesting has already started in the last ten days of last month, and it will be completed this month. The output has increased compared to last year. Various sugar factories are preparing to set up cars for boiling, and the old sugar in the sugar households has long been scarce. Most of them are rushing to put new sugar on the market. The current market price of old sugar is 90,000 for true grade, 85,000 for red sand, 60,000 for raw water red sand, and 30,000 for leaky water. In the future, the market price may still increase.</p>
<p>In the past seven or eight years, the popularity of sugarcane production and sales has been a great source of profit for sugarcane farmers. In addition to the daily consumption of cane sugar as fruit, many foods are made with sugar, which seems to symbolize the leisurely and sweet life of the people in the sugar producing area, and the theory that civilization and things go hand in hand: "The countries with the most consumption of sugar are also the countries with the most cultural progress." In this way, it not only increases the wealth of the local area, but also promotes the progress of local culture.</p>
<p>Fragrant Red Lotus Roots, Lotus Coins Spread All Over the Lake</p>
<p>Poyang has mostly plains and rich lakes and marshes. Farmers adapt to local conditions and plant lotus on a large scale. The output of lotus seeds is also the most abundant, which is the main source of income for Poyang farmers' side business. The lotus produced in Poyang is no less than that produced in Hunan. The grains are large, the powder is thick, and the quality and taste are excellent. Lotus is divided into red and white, with red being more common and white being of better quality. The land and lakes are all alluvial mud, which is wet, loose and fertile, making it easy to plant lotus. Farmers do not spend much effort to plant them at will, allowing them to grow naturally. After the lotus seeds are ripe and harvested, the lake water dries up in winter, and the lotus roots continue to be dug up, either as vegetables or made into lotus root powder, which are all called delicacies. The market price of Poyang lotus before the war was only 20 to 30 yuan per dan. In recent years, the price has gradually increased. Last year, the selling price in the producing area was 90,000 to 110,000 yuan. This year, the new white lotus has risen to 180,000 yuan in recent months, and it is exported to various ports such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Xunhan.</p>
<p>What lake lotus is most afraid of is the flooding of white water, which damages the lotus stems. If the stems are broken, they cannot grow lotus pods, and the seeds will wither. If there is no flood year, the production will be a bumper harvest. Especially when the lotus stems are strong and the lotus leaves are full, the red and white buds are blooming in the morning and evening, setting off a natural colored picture. If you have read the article "On the Love of Lotus", and you go to see the graceful lotus pods and fragrant lotus roots in the lake, and the fun of fish playing with lotus coins, you will feel the same love as Zhou Dunyi!</p>
<p>Clothing and Blankets for the People, Keeping Out the Cold is Worthy of Silk</p>
<p>The counties in Raozhou, northern Jiangxi, are alluvial lands by the side of Poyang Lake, making them the most suitable areas for cotton cultivation. The area of cotton planting in the entire province is also the largest in counties such as Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, Wannian, Hukou, Leping, and Fuliang. Most of the cotton varieties are medium cotton, with two types: white seed, black seed, and smooth seed. The best quality is Hukou white seed cotton, which is the best variety of cotton in the province, and it also occupies a considerable position in the domestic medium cotton grade. The Shanghai-Hankou market calls it Jiujiang cotton, which belongs to this cotton. Its characteristics are strong development and rich production. The harvest of seeded cotton per mu is valued at 110 catties to 200 catties. Only because the fiber is short and coarse, it cannot spin cotton yarn above 20 counts. The other 1 to 8/5 inches can only spin 8 to 16 counts of cotton yarn. Compared with the quality of improved American cotton varieties in other provinces, it is far behind.</p>
<p>In the past, the sales channels for cotton, such as Jiujiang and Hukou cotton, were mostly purchased by the Jiuxing Yarn Factory in Xun City. Most of the rest is for self-use or for inland handmade weaving. According to the statistics of the Jiujiang Customs, the output of Jiangxi cotton was the largest in the 19th year of the Republic of China, totaling 70,809 dan, which is almost one percent of the output of cotton in Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the cotton production in each county this year is still considered to be abundant. However, although the area of cotton fields has increased compared to before, the development is not long due to excessive rainfall this summer. After autumn, the weather is dry, and the late development of cotton crops is slightly hindered. Compared with the first estimate, it is slightly inferior. With the increased planting of cotton fields in various places, the average production volume should not be less. When the new cotton was put on the market this year, the market price of seeded cotton per catty from flower vendors ranged from 600 to 1,000, which is equivalent to 245,000 yuan per dan of lint cotton, which is ten times higher than last year. In recent months, due to the increase in prices, the Hujiang flower market has opened at 170,000 to 190,000 yuan, and flower sales have become bleak. Cotton farmers are also holding back the harvested flowers and not selling them.</p>
<p>Their original purpose of planting cotton is first for self-use. If the sales are good and the price rises, they will sell the surplus. If the sales are sluggish and the price falls, they will store all of them for the need for cotton-padded clothes and quilts at any time. Women who can spin yarn spin yarn, those who can weave cloth weave cloth, and those who cannot spin or weave exchange flowers for cloth. They only seek to keep out the cold and do not admire brocade clothes. No matter how the price of cloth on the market is rising, they are simply not affected in the slightest. It has the style of Mahatma Gandhi, self-planting, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing, which is a self-reliance doctrine that does not seek help from others. As for silk and woolen fabrics, they are even farther away from them, and they never have a clothing relationship with them. "Coarse clothes are warm, and vegetable roots are fragrant, and the taste of production is long," which seems to be a true portrayal of their real lives.</p>
<p>A Wisp of Smoke, Revealing a Different Fragrance</p>
<p>The tobacco producing areas in Jiangxi Province include Nanxiong, Ruichang, Jinxian, Ruijin, Guangfeng, Duchang, and Poyang. The quality of tobacco in Nanxiong and Ruijin is the best, followed by Poyang, and then Duchang. Duchang has a relatively large area for planting tobacco, which is the largest source of income for rural side businesses. Before the war, the total value of Jiangxi tobacco exports was more than 3 million yuan per year. Farmers plant tobacco in varying amounts, mostly planted in the gaps in the plains. The planting procedure is to scatter the tiny tobacco seeds for planting in March and April of the lunar calendar. After using soybean cake as fertilizer and mixing it into the mud of the tobacco fields, cultivate it once to build a strip of soil ridge. After a certain period of time, transplant the tobacco seedlings onto the tobacco fields. In May and June, the tobacco will grow, and after a short time, it can be harvested. The harvesting process of tobacco leaves has two phases: "Fu leaves" and "Autumn leaves". The quality and taste of Fu leaves are better and the price is more expensive. The harvest period is in the hot summer weather. Autumn leaves are harvested in the autumn period, the quality is inferior, and the price is lower.</p>
<p>Now that prices are rising, the selling price of tobacco silk is more than 100 yuan per gram. Farmers have a deep fondness for tobacco, which is a good companion that they cannot live without during their field operations. In order to avoid the outflow of profits, tobacco farmers in the producing areas mostly use their own tobacco leaves to make tobacco silk themselves. They plant, make, and smoke themselves. Their tobacco pipes are all made of bamboo roots, with a tobacco pouch attached, and they are usually inserted in the waist. Whether they are idle or busy, they cannot be without this gentleman for a moment. Occasionally, they hold it to offer guests to taste, and a wisp of smoke reveals a different fragrance. The relaxing function of this "Acacia grass" is no less than "tea as wine when guests come on cold nights."</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Top Ten Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Hualien Port, 11th Day News</p>
<p>The Taiwan Province, taken over from the Japanese, experienced unbearable quiet scenes for several months this spring. The chaotic crowding and delays are still unforgettable. However, this was only a temporary transition. Over the past six months, the urgent improvement and reorganization of transportation have shortened the distance between Keelung and Kaohsiung ports to the mainland. At the same time, the people of this province deeply feel that only thanks to the rapid recovery of transportation can Taiwan truly become a province of China in name and in fact.</p>
<p>The most significant achievement is the restoration of railway transport capacity to 100%. Initially, 60 trains were running daily, now it has reached 120 trains. In terms of highways, the main lines maintain one trip per day, four trips a day on crucial routes, and the most important ones can reach one trip every five minutes, like the Taipei to Keelung line. As for the port clearing work, 50,000 tons of sunken ships have been salvaged in Keelung and Kaohsiung. Among them, nine have been landed, and two in Keelung and three in Kaohsiung are still being salvaged. The wartime scene of the ports can no longer be traced.</p>
<p>In a hotel in Hualien Port during his trip, this reporter interviewed Director Ren Xianqun, who controls the lifeline of the new Taiwan's transportation, for half an hour. He told the reporter: From January to June next year, eight domestic and foreign shipping routes will be established. In addition, two routes that must be completed in the second half of the year, making a total of ten major shipping routes, including:</p>
<p>(1) Taiwan Eastern Line: From Keelung to Suao, Hualien Port, Taitung, Green Island, Orchid Island, Kaohsiung, and Penghu in the east, using 500-ton ships, starting in January.</p>
<p>(2) Taiwan, Xiamen, Fuzhou triangular shipping route.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Line: This is a scheduled transport, and it has been decided that three ships will take turns sailing, once every ten days. One of them can arrive in 36 hours.</p>
<p>(4) Qingdao, Tianjin Line, twice a month in January.</p>
<p>(5) Shantou, Hong Kong Line, twice a month in January.</p>
<p>(6) Wenzhou Line.</p>
<p>(7) Yangtze River Line, directly to Hankou.</p>
<p>(8) Dalian Line, will be opened as soon as the situation stabilizes.</p>
<p>(9) Philippine Line.</p>
<p>(10) Singapore Line.</p>
<p>(9) and (10) are scheduled to start in the second half of the year. In addition to the imminent railway, the establishment of a provincial airline is also planned, and air transport in this province can be restored next year. These are all actively unfolding under two policies: The main focus is on political significance and increasing provincial revenue—encouraging travel to Taiwan; The second is to decide that Keelung will become a purely trading port, with all foreign goods transshipped from that port to various parts of South China; Kaohsiung Port in the south will become the focus of transportation to the mainland and Southeast Asia! Currently, Keelung's warehouse capacity has been expanded from 20,000 tons to 80,000 tons, and is expected to reach 200,000 tons by the end of next year. Kaohsiung Port will increase from 45,000 tons to 150,000 tons, and general travel facilities are also being designed.</p>
<p>In Taiwan Province, where manpower and resources are quite difficult, Director Ren deeply understands the difficulties he must encounter in order to complete these ten shipping routes as scheduled. But he said frankly and firmly that there is no other way but to overcome difficulties. He further pointed out that the current favorable conditions for the shipping industry in this province are low prices, simplified procedures, and a "supply exceeding demand" situation that is exactly the opposite of the mainland.</p>
<p>Director Ren firmly believes that with his spirit and experience in reorganizing transportation in the past six months, maritime transportation will not be a problem next year. Because this will not only prosper this province, but also strengthen the centripetal force of the isolated Taiwan Province towards the mainland. The voyage between Taiwan and the mainland has been shortened! Keelung and Kaohsiung will also regain their previous glory in world trade and transportation!"</p>
<h3>Fire in Kowloon Relief Goods Warehouse</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zijian of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Kowloon, 18th Day News</p>
<p>The warehouse set up by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) on Chatham Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, opposite Hong Kong, suddenly caught fire at 10:30 pm on the 17th, burning for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Navy and Army also dispatched personnel to assist in the fire fighting, because in addition to the CRRRA warehouse, there was also a parking lot of the Hong Kong military authorities, with hundreds of military vehicles parked. Fortunately, the fire did not spread, and some vehicles and important equipment (including a lathe worth 600,000 yuan) in the CRRRA warehouse were safe. According to current information, the lost goods include a large number of automobile tires, numbering hundreds, and several barrels of gasoline. Further investigation is still underway.</p>
<p>The CRRRA warehouse is located at the intersection of Chatham Road and Gascoigne Road, covering a large area and surrounded by wire mesh. Vehicles and related equipment transported by UNRRA are stored here. At one end of the site, there are two wooden houses serving as offices, one storing tires, canvas, etc. The other is a power generation room. Because the area is pitch black at night, the authorities generate their own electricity to protect the stored goods from theft by criminals, keeping the surroundings bright and making it easier for guards to prevent theft. Next to the generator room, there are four rooms where the watchmen and generator drivers live. It is said that after the power was turned on last night, the driver went out. Unexpectedly, perhaps due to the long time, the heat was too high, and somehow the wooden boards next to it caught fire, causing the big fire. The fire on the wooden boards quickly spread to the sundries in the room and the wooden house where the tires and canvas were stored, and the fire became even more intense. After receiving the report, three fire trucks rushed to the rescue, but water did not arrive until half an hour after arrival, due to water restrictions at night. Before the water arrived, firefighters could only use fire extinguishers to put out the fire and dismantle the road to prevent the fire from spreading to other places. By the time the hose was opened, the two small wooden houses had been almost completely burned down, but because most of them were tires, the fire was still very fierce. During the burning, small explosions often occurred. After 11:40 pm, the fire was completely under control and extinguished around 12:00. At that time, a northwest wind was blowing, which did not spread to most of the vehicles on its side. There were hundreds of unopened car boxes on its side, stacked three feet high and covering an area of six or seven feet. There were also twenty-four newly assembled cars on Gascoigne Road, and six or seven cars under the wire mesh. In addition, a lathe for repairing tools worth HK$600,000 was also safe. After the incident, UNRRA engineer Kerton immediately went to the scene to direct employees to rescue. The most valuable lathe was rescued at this time.</p>

<h3>Science and Culture Chinese Delegation Evening Party, the Musical Accomplishments of Two Ladies from Hubei and Guangdong can be compared with European and American Artists</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Ren of this Newspaper in Paris</p>
<p>13th Day News</p>
<p>From mid-November to mid-December 1946, the French call it Science and Culture Month Mols de I'Unesco. The music of Qin and Ge, the joy of banquets, is unprecedented and always makes people feel overwhelmed. The most commendable is the Chinese Science and Culture Delegation's late-night Soiree at the Chemical Society at 9:00 pm on December 9th. Those who attended included Ambassador Qian Jieping (Thailand), Madame Qian, Miss Qian, consular officials in Paris, representatives from various countries to the Science and Culture Conference, and important men and women from the United States, Britain, and France who are friendly to China. Also present were Ms. Yang Lianxin, a female singer Cantatrice from the Royal Academy of Music in England, Ms. Rosemarie Anderson Han, a former student who specially flew to Paris to invite Ms. Yang to promote national glory in Norway. Representatives from the Science and Culture industry, including Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Dr. Li Shuhua, Dr. Cheng Tianfang, and Dr. Zhu Kezhen, as well as Professor Chen Yuan, Mr. Xiao Zisheng (Yu), Chairman of the China-France Association and former Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Mining, Ms. Xiao Lingxiao Yin, wife of Chen Yuan, Ms. Pan Yuliang, former professor, Dr. Zhou Lin, Xie Shou Kang, former Chinese Ambassador to the Vatican and a scholar of the Royal Academy of Literature of Belgium, Hu Tianshi, Director of the Swiss International Library, Guo Youshou, former Director of the Sichuan Education Department, Qian Cundian, Counselor of the Embassy in the United Kingdom, and members of the delegation Qu Junong, Liang Fangzhong, Ye Junjian, Kuang Zixiu, Wang Chengxu, Qian Sanqiang, etc., as well as hundreds of Chinese and foreign male and female guests.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese students studying in Europe have made significant progress compared to the end of the first Paris Peace Conference twenty years ago. The Science and Education Bureau's great Renaissance painting has also provided an excellent opportunity for famous Chinese artists to show their talents on the international stage. For example, the two sisters from Hubei and Guangdong who came to help this time have scientific achievements and can be compared with European and American talents. It is impossible without ten years of large-scale sacrifice of money and time. The long-term War of Resistance of China has just completed the artistic efforts of these people over the years. It is enough to make compatriots at home and abroad have optimistic expectations for the future of China. This delegation's late-night victory and the scientific and cultural complementing Qin and Ge programs should be divided into three sections as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The former section, Zhou Xiaoyan, daughter of Shanghai banker Zhou Cangbai, sang Chinese songs scored into the wind by singer Jiangxia Zhou, Piano (ie piano), (1) Song of the Lotus time. (2) petite pois Rouges, both of the above songs were composed by Chinese young composer Liu Xue'an. (3) Love Call, the score was compiled by Jiang Wenye. (4) How Can I Help Thlnklng of You. Written by Zhao Yuanren, now professor of Chinese studies at Harvard University in the United States. (5) Yunnan Mountain Song, which has a slight local flavor. This song was adapted into a score by Russian musician A. Tcherepnine Qi Peilin, who once traveled to China. The Eastern and Western styles are smelted in one furnace. The singer is skilled and light, and the round and smooth sound is most welcomed by the Western guests present.</p>
<p>(B) The middle section, Ms. Li Xianmin from Lingnan, who graduated first in Shanghai Conservatory of Music, studied abroad with famous teachers for many years, and is talented, clear, and unique, played the piano. (1) Overture to the Music Drama, scored by Liu Xue'an. (2) La Fluteu Berger, composed by He Luding. (3) d, composed by Lao Jingcheng. (4) Sketch, composed by Jiang Wenye. (5) Button Qin. (6) Yi Bi Zhonghua, the scores of the above rain songs were all made by Russian musician Qi Peilin. Qi once traveled to China, and was inspired by listening to the pipa, so he described its sound in the score. Ms. Li sits sideways on the piano platform, her eyes are bright and her hands are agile, she plucks lightly, moves rhythmically, strums fiercely and strikes quickly, and the beauty lies in her graceful posture. "Yi Bi Zhonghua" has both advantages, and the reporter has never seen such a demeanor and impression in the music performances of Europe and the United States in his life. (C) The latter section is the most exciting performance. The wonderful thing is that Ms. Zhou is proficient in English, Italian, French and German, and the performances come in turn, as if she has the technique of incarnation. She improvised a seven-character quatrain by Zhou Xiaoyan Jiahui to broadcast the clear sound, with the sentence:</p>
<p>"The golden age is full of vigor, singing red beans and smiling, the pearl throat is busy like a swallow, and the sound education is widely promoted with this talent." I also received a close-up photo from Ms. Li Xianmin, and I also responded with a poem, with the sentence:</p>
<p>"The fragrance of the clothes moves slightly, and the night is bright, the quick button is played lightly, and all kinds of amorous feelings are born, the immortal Ci Xian is surnamed Li, how can the magic hand be different from Xia Qing? (A female aviator who travels to North and South America has the same surname as you).</p>

<h3>The Call for Theatrical Movement</h3>
<p>Several comrades engaged in theatrical work recently had a symposium at the Central Cultural Movement Committee. They expressed many opinions on the Chinese theatrical movement. Mr. Yu Shangyuan was appointed to organize them on the spot. The following article is the record of the organization. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who care about the theatrical movement will provide more assistance so that the Chinese theatrical movement can develop normally.</p>
<p>With the victorious end of the eight-year War of Resistance, we should build a new China with national independence, civil rights and freedom, and the people's livelihood and happiness with more abundant cooked feelings and more active efforts. This is the responsibility of every Chinese people, and it is also the responsibility of every theatrical worker. Unfortunately, after returning to the capital and returning to the army, and when preparing to start work, like other departments of cultural undertakings, the theatrical movement has more difficulties. The experience of the past year has told us that if we do not quickly save the current crisis, the future of the theatrical movement is really difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>The environment of the eight-year War of Resistance was extremely difficult. Thanks to the sincere unity of theatrical workers across the country, under the leadership of the All-China Theatrical Community Anti-Enemy Association, each did their best and went all out, which had laid a relatively solid foundation. Whether in the rear, the front line, behind the enemy, or the isolated Shanghai, whether in cities or villages, they have left visible achievements, directly or indirectly contributing to the War of Resistance. We are unwilling to deny our own insufficient efforts and certain weaknesses in this stage. Similarly, we are unwilling to ignore the various difficulties imposed on the theatrical movement by the objective environment. Because the problem has not been resolved immediately and reasonably, we are still suffering today. Moreover, with the evolution of the objective situation, there are even new problems in front of us. We theatrical workers know that our duty is to overcome all difficulties to promote the theatrical movement. However, the theatrical movement is not an isolated thing that is isolated from the vast society. We cannot but ask people from all walks of life and the government authorities to have a deeper understanding, sympathy and assistance to the current situation of the theatrical movement, so that it can smoothly overcome the current crisis.</p>
<p>The fact that the troupes in Nanjing (Shanghai, Hankou, and other recovered cities) - including state-owned, private, professional, and amateur - cannot perform or perform with great difficulty and end up with few praises and even lose money is a common phenomenon. Tracing its cause, the first is the problem of entertainment tax.</p>
<p>We do not think that the problem of entertainment tax has only economic significance. Through the micro-collection rate of "40%", it clearly treats dramas and other kinds of entertainment equally. We do not deny the entertainment of dramas, but the difference is that it has more educational effects in entertainment - a broad education, that is, to improve the cultural level of the audience (people), and to get upward inspiration and encouragement from here. At the same time, drama is precisely the concrete manifestation of the national culture. This is the reason why the British would rather give up India than give up Shakespeare, and it is also the reason why we set up the National Academy of Drama and never thought of running a school to train other entertainment talents; it is also the reason why the Ministry of Education and the Central Propaganda Department set up drama awards during the War of Resistance. Although the 40% entertainment tax is collected on the ticket and is added to the audience, the troupe is actually the one who suffers the loss. If the tax is exempted or reduced to 5% or 10%, the audience will pay the same ticket price, and the troupe will increase its income, which can further reduce the ticket price and attract more audiences.</p>
<p>The general increase in prices has obviously greatly increased the cost of performances. The total expenditure for an performance of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan has become very common. Among them, the most suitable for saving is the rent of the theater. The rent of the National Grand Theater for the performance of the China ×× Troupe in Beijing was 500,000 yuan per game (per night), and then it rose to 1.8 million yuan per game. Even if it can be reduced, it cannot be less than 1 million yuan per game. The Guangming Grand Theater, which can only accommodate 700 people, such as the one rented by the Great Wall Theater Company, is 600,000 yuan per game. Because the theater does not have its own theater, it not only has to bear the huge rent as above, but also has intangible losses, such as the length of the performance period cannot be free, which not only affects the economy, but also affects the art - the contract cannot be signed and dared to start work rashly, once the contract is signed, it must be on stage as scheduled and not allowed to consider whether the play is well rehearsed, which gives us great pain.</p>
<p>Drama cannot be separated from the audience. The Nanjing theatrical movement, which has only started now, is also affected by the audience. We are not criticizing the audience, but this is the fact. Due to high prices and difficult life. The purchasing power of the general audience has been greatly reduced. Even if they like drama very much, they are often limited by their economic ability and stop in place. This is one. Except for some people who have returned from Chongqing, most of the people who have struggled under the rule of the enemy and puppets, even if they have not completely sunk into low-level entertainment, are still relatively unfamiliar with drama. It is difficult to enthusiastically find the things they need from the drama stage. This is two. If the audience asks to find the things they need from the drama stage, what can we give them? Reflecting reality is a feature of drama. When they feel that there is a distance between the stage at this time and place and the life at this time and place. Once disappointed, one more time you have to wait and see. This is three. To make the audience know drama and love drama, there must be regular performances and excellent performances, and this is a difficult thing.</p>
<p>If we have unintentionally disappointed the audience, it is our own fault. We admit that there have been few new scripts this year, and even fewer scripts suitable for this time and place. Before we ask playwrights to write more. We should also understand the situation of playwrights. The fact is that, on the one hand, the objective environment up to now cannot be understood at a glance. It is a creative detour to praise or expose it only by seeing the superficial phenomenon. This takes time. On the one hand, when performances (as well as publications and publications) are so difficult, there is no way to urge playwrights to continuously supply new works. Some people are preparing, some people are writing, and some people have written but are reluctant to take it out. This requires a stable environment. Similarly, without time and a stable environment, not only playwrights, but also directors, actors, and stage workers will find it difficult to have new creations, resulting in stagnation and even regression.</p>
<p>The stagnation and even regression of theatrical workers is the stagnation and regression of the theatrical movement. Reflecting on ourselves, we should blame ourselves for insufficient understanding, insufficient efforts, and insufficient unity. However, in any case, the improvement of the objective environment is a more important prerequisite. We firmly believe that people from all walks of life and the government authorities cherish the theatrical movement. Therefore, at this time and place, we have described the current situation and hope that:</p>
<p>(1) Confirm the position of drama in culture and education, and give it positive, strong, and planned support, so that drama becomes the healthy spiritual food of the people of the whole country and an important pillar of national construction.</p>
<p>(2) Exempt or reduce entertainment tax. The performances of all state-owned troupes and private troupes that have been approved for registration by the competent authorities shall be exempted from entertainment tax to reduce the burden on the theater and popularize the audience.</p>
<p>(3) Establish state-owned theaters and provide them to troupes completely free of charge or at a very low rent. At the beginning, enemy and puppet properties can be requisitioned to replace construction.</p>
<p>(4) Guarantee the livelihood of theater workers, so that theater workers can engage in creation and research with peace of mind and concentration.</p>
<p>(5) Reward script creation and performance.</p>
<p>This is the urgent task to save the crisis, and this is also our call. We theatrical workers should unite as sincerely as during the War of Resistance, do our best, go all out, overcome difficulties together, overcome the crisis, and participate in the great cause of building a new China with national independence, people's freedom, and people's happiness!</p>

<h3>Publishing and Taxation</h3>
<p>— Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Recently, two major events have occurred in the Chinese publishing industry, both of which will have a great impact on the publishing industry. One is the issue of business tax on the book industry, and the other is the issue of price increases for news mail and telecommunications. The book industry and the news media are asking the government to reconsider and save China's declining cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>Regarding the business tax on the book industry, we know that after the Shanghai Municipal Council resolved to exempt it, 286 book businesses in Shanghai sent 17 representatives to Beijing to petition, asking the Ministry of Finance to exempt the tax. However, recently, the Book Industry Association received a message from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Finance, which only allowed state-approved textbooks to be exempt from business tax, and the rest must still be taxed. Now the book industry is sending representatives to Beijing to petition again. We hope that the government will pay special attention to the cultural publishing industry and approve the full exemption. At the same time, we also hope that the municipal authorities will, on the one hand, accept the resolution of the Municipal Council to increase the construction loss, and on the other hand, adopt the resolution to exempt the business tax on the book industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the price increase of news mail and telecommunications, the Xinwen Bao had a dramatic record on the 17th, which said: "Today, more than 150 reporters from various places went to Minister Yu in the Traffic Ministry Building, which cost nearly 10 billion yuan to repair and is unparalleled and exquisite, to petition for the ten-fold increase in mail and telecommunications prices, and to maintain the original prices in order to continue the cultural undertakings. Because in this high price of mail and telecommunications, the national news undertakings will suffer huge losses. During the two-hour petition, Minister Yu said that he was not interested in making things difficult for the news media." We know that the government has suffered a lot of losses in mail and telecommunications and must find ways to make up for them. A reasonable price increase and the collection of business tax are the country's financial resources, which we seem to have no need to comment on, but the government should not treat the publishing and cultural industry as equal to other commercial businesses that aim at profit, and should give special consideration to them.</p>
<p>However, under the situation that the government particularly emphasizes opening up sources of income, we feel that the government should rectify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, and the most important thing seems to be to spend more effort in saving money, so as not to overemphasize the cultural undertakings.</p>
<h3>On the Path of Chinese Education Reform</h3>
<p>— Chen Kemei</p>
<p>Written by Chen Guofu, Published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>All those with foresight regarding Chinese education feel that Chinese education needs a philosophy to integrate its implementation under one or several principles. It cannot continue to copy and imitate from the West, resulting in little effect after fifty years. While everyone feels this way, few have come forward to provide this need. Mr. Wu Junsheng once suggested that scholars from all fields across the country first conduct a comprehensive investigation of China's past culture and modern needs to determine a common philosophy. Then, based on this philosophy, deduce several guiding principles as a foundation for theory and implementation to form an educational philosophy. This is one approach. Alternatively, scholars from all fields can freely publish their research, then synthesize or select from these studies to determine the principles of educational theory and implementation, thus creating an educational philosophy. Perhaps neither of these methods is suitable, and we can only allow the free development of various ideas and the natural formation of an educational philosophy.</p>
<p>In 1933, Mr. Jiang Qi published a book titled "Educational Philosophy" (also named "The Three Principles of the People Education"), hoping it would become a Chinese educational philosophy. Its impact is unknown. Now I have read Mr. Chen Guofu's "The Path of Chinese Education Reform," which also proposes educational reform based on the Three Principles of the People. However, this book differs from the previous one. The former leans towards pure theory, while this book emphasizes application and has a complete educational plan.</p>
<p>The book's content can be summarized in two parts: the first discusses general principles and education at all levels, and the second discusses various educational issues and methods for implementing reforms. Regarding principles, it is "entirely based on our country's inherent ethical philosophy, with filial piety as its starting point, gradually expanding to realize the ideal of 'the world is for all' and 'universal harmony.'" ... Even the entire educational process or system in the book is based on our country's philosophical system of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace as the basis for dividing the process, "so that education at each stage has a distinct central goal." (From Wang's preface) And of these two parts, principles are the most important. As the author says, "I believe that in improving education, principles are the most important, and methods are secondary." (Page 1) Therefore, this book has the flavor of an educational philosophy and the potential to form one.</p>
<p>Today's Need for Educational Philosophy</p>
<p>The author has completed this book based on decades of observation and experience, and it certainly contains unique insights and comprehensive proposals. For example, he says that the "main reason for the failure" of past education "lies in the fact that our education has lost its spirit of self-confidence and initiative, only seeing others and forgetting ourselves; therefore, we only know how to copy, unable to digest, let alone ..." He also says that the root cause of the failure of Chinese education is ... "finding the starting point of education ... several decades ... pouring ... lingering ... glimpse ... is ... maintaining ... view ... of ethics ...?" That is ... subtle ... is the author ... is the author ... he ... saying the insight itself is ... that, but saying that Chinese education should still maintain filial piety as the starting point and give full play to its effectiveness" is unique. Based on this starting point of education, the author especially emphasizes family education, "Therefore, family education is the fundamental question of all problems in the human world," establishing "a foundation for being a person" for life. Starting from this foundation, "national education," "life education," "special education," "normal education," "university education," and "imperial academy education" are all based on the philosophy of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace, and their establishments are based on it: this is the author's comprehensive proposal. Therefore, this book is also a most stimulating work, which can stimulate the creation of Chinese educational philosophy and also stimulate the opening up of new Chinese education.</p>
<p>As for whether China's educational philosophy should be formed in this way, and whether China's new education should be carried out in this way, in my humble opinion, I will briefly state my views as a small contribution.</p>
<p>The Starting Point of Education</p>
<p>I have stated that Chinese culture has two characteristics: one is the ethical characteristic, and the other is the conservative characteristic. I have also criticized that this type of ethical culture pays too much attention to family relationships in human relations and neglects larger social relationships. Therefore, the Chinese people's family concept is too deep, resulting in a weak national or social concept, and failing to produce a strong and unified national group to resist various aggressions from the great powers (Education and Culture, Education Communication, Volume 3, Issue 41). Although it is said very well in theory that taking filial piety as the starting point, "establishing normal rules for the ethical relationship between parents and siblings, and extending it from there, social order, national governance, and peace can be maintained as a result"; but in fact, the Chinese people (especially the most highly educated people under the old education) mostly only know about the family and do not know about the country, let alone the world, and the so-called "the world is for all" or "universal harmony" is even more impossible to achieve. Why has the moral education of China for thousands of years failed to teach people to extend fraternal piety to society? There are two reasons: one is that the ideal is too high and difficult to implement; the other is that the circle is drawn too large and cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Therefore, thousands of years of moral education have only taught people to live a family life and maintain a patriarchal society; but now that the competition for survival is so fierce and the national struggle is so fierce, it will soon transform China's family life and patriarchal society.</p>
<p>The Goal of Education</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need to teach the people now is how to seek the survival of the nation, to enable the national masses to engage in production and construction in peacetime and to resist and defend themselves in wartime, and to enable everyone to have the intelligence for production and self-defense and the spirit of unity and sacrifice. Even "the world is for all" and "universal harmony" may as well be taught one step at a time. Speaking of the intelligence of production and self-defense, it is naturally based on science; speaking of the spirit of unity and sacrifice, it is also naturally based on democracy. Only science and democracy can enable the Chinese nation to catch up head-on; and only science and democracy can achieve the world for all and universal harmony. Therefore, China's new education should take the Three Principles of the People as its ideal, national rejuvenation as its goal, and nationalization, democratization, scientification, and industrialization as its guidelines. Or to put it more concretely, China's new education should cultivate healthy citizens who can build and defend themselves. The focus of this new education is to promote a new national spirit—a spirit in which the individual and the nation are integrated, a spirit of dedication and sacrifice to the nation. Only with this spirit can the Chinese nation stand firm; only if the nation stands firm first can we seek the transformation of the world, from the family to the nation, and from the nation to the world. This is the program for human social evolution and the stage that the state and society must go through. The starting point of this new education is individuality, based on the individuality of each child, to develop their body and mind, so that they can share in the work of national rejuvenation; we must make the development of individuality and the rejuvenation of the nation match each other to adapt to this unprecedented era.</p>
<p>As for the methods of developing children's bodies and minds and promoting the national spirit, there is no need to draw a large circle, that is, to use children's common nature and special personality to cultivate their national emotions and national consciousness. For example, children have a common sense of curiosity, which can be used to visit China's historical sites and scenic spots to arouse their emotions of loving China and their awareness of recognizing China; to make them feel and know that China is a civilized nation with a long history, and to make them feel and know that China has magnificent rivers and mountains with abundant resources: in this way, children's spirit of being willing to sacrifice for their country and nation can arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>In short, the ideal of national new education should meet the needs of the times. What is needed in the present era? It is the struggle and survival of the nation, that is, to cultivate healthy citizens with a national spirit to seek national survival from the national struggle. Of course, we are by no means saying that we do not want people to be filial and fraternal, but we believe that people who are filial and fraternal do not necessarily love their country and nation, while people who love their country and nation are certainly able to be filial and fraternal.</p>
<p>The Educational Process</p>
<p>The author says, "The stage of primary school education is a kind of moral education, which teaches the foundation of how to be a person and cultivates the concept of loving the country and the nation. The stage of junior high school education is to cultivate personal skills and knowledge for independent living. The stage of senior high school education is not only to educate him to be able to make a living on his own, but also to be able to help others make a living. Therefore, the stage of middle school can be said to be the education of 'managing the family.' But the word 'family' here should be extended to a social interpretation. At the stage of university, he is taught the education of 'governing the country,' cultivating his professional skills to seek welfare for the country and the nation. Further up to the Imperial Academy, he is taught the education of 'pacifying the world.' In this way, from self-cultivation, managing the family, governing the country to pacifying the world, the front and back operate smoothly, and each becomes a paragraph. It is really a very good educational process." (Page 12) To divide the current educational programs according to the program of self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the university, but in our view, the fundamental nature of the former is not the same. The educational program in the university is an educational program for cultivating a few scholar-officials, while the current educational programs at all levels are educational programs for cultivating talents at all levels. It is fundamentally difficult to match the two. The difference between the educational program in the university and the current educational program is very obvious. Because the self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the university is the entire program for cultivating a kind of talent, which cannot be separated; from self-cultivation to family management, from family management to governing the country, from governing the country to pacifying the world, it runs through, and cannot be divided into sections again. As for the current education at all levels, it is to cultivate talents at all levels, which can be divided into sections; as the author said, "Every stage has the effect of a stage; every step taught has a use": whether it has been done in fact (the big problem of Chinese education is that it has not been done), in principle it should be so. Therefore, China's new education must not divide the educational program for cultivating multiple talents according to the educational program for cultivating one kind of talent.</p>
<p>The above two points are only discussed in terms of the largest; other topics such as the rumination education method, the coordination of the Three Principles of the People and the education of each stage, and life education have not been discussed in detail; as for paying attention to mother education and paying attention to the continuity and independence of education at all levels, there are all excellent insights, which have not been described in detail. In China, it is really commendable for someone like Mr. Chen to find a direction for Chinese education with a consistent stand, although our opinions are not completely the same. In short, this is a very stimulating work and a good reference book for those who are interested in the reform of Chinese education. It is worth everyone's chewing and reviewing.</p>

<h3>Best-Selling Books in the United States in 1946</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning</p>
<p>As winter ends and the year draws to a close, "Time" magazine in the United States has conducted a review of the books published in the United States this year. In 1946, 7,500 new books were published, including 1,500 novels, 300 history books, and 400 biographies. The quality of these books, generally speaking, is not very high.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, book critics have not published excessive praises. In the "Year's Most Outstanding Books" poll in the "New York Times Book Review," no book has received unanimous praise from all book critics. Selecting the best from the short. In terms of the widest sales and the most money earned, it should be "The Egg and I" by Ms. Betty MacDonald—an epic about raising chickens (or an autobiography of married life) that has sold 1.2 million copies. The remaining nine best-selling books are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<p>Author</p>
<p>This Side of Innocence Caldwell</p>
<p>The King's General Du Maurier</p>
<p>The Foxes of Harrow Frank Yerby</p>
<p>Arch of Triumph Maria Remarque</p>
<p>Brideshead Revisited Evelyn Waugh</p>
<p>David the King Gladys Schmitt</p>
<p>The Hucksters Frederic Wakeman</p>
<p>Non-Fiction Author</p>
<p>The Egg and I Betty MacDonald</p>
<p>Peace of Mind L. Liebman</p>
<p>I Chose Freedom Victor Kravchenko</p>
<p>Among the seven fiction books, most of the sales have exceeded one million. Among them, "Arch of Triumph" by Remarque, often serialized in the "Saturday Evening Post" weekly, was translated into Chinese by Zhu Wen.</p>
<p>No one knows whether the reason why these books have such wide sales should be attributed to writing, advertising, or the promotion of various book clubs in the United States.</p>
<p>According to "Time" magazine, a new literary genius has not yet appeared after the war. People in the American publishing industry often explain it this way: It hasn't been long since the war ended, so masterpieces haven't been completed yet. But is this true? Let's take a look at the book list after 1919 (World War I): "Rousseau and Romanticism" by Babbitt, "The Arrow of Gold" by Conrad, "The Economic Consequences of the Peace" by Keynes, "Reynaud the Fox" by Masefield, "The Moon of the Caribbees" by O'Neill, and "The Moon and Sixpence" by Maugham were all immortal works of that year. The stimulus of World War II may have been too great for people, and geniuses cannot yet answer those complex questions through art.</p>
<h3>"Son of the Regiment"</h3>
<p>— Li Jinxiang</p>
<p>Written by Kataev, translated by Mao Dun, first published in early October of the 35th year of the Republic</p>
<p>The Soviet writer Kataev, his name may not be unfamiliar to readers in the mountain country. Seven or eight years ago, two of his works, "Time, Forward!" and "I Am the Son of the Working People," had Chinese translations.</p>
<p>"Son of the Regiment" is a novel with a large number of readers in the Soviet Union. It won the Stalin Literary Award in 1945. That year, there were a total of four awards for literature in the field of novels. "Son of the Regiment" won the second prize in the novel category, and the first prize was awarded to "Young Guards" and "Lavrov." The other novel that won the second prize was ...</p>
<p>The whole book takes the Soviet-German war as its theme, and the story develops in a plain atmosphere from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The protagonist of this book, Vanya, is a lonely Russian child. Brutal ambition has destroyed his beautiful home, killed his parents, and made him wander outside all year round. Fortunately, he met the motherland's reconnaissance soldiers, who rescued him and brought him to their regimental headquarters.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reconnaissance soldiers soon discovered the child's genius, intelligence, bravery, and attractiveness, making him a natural reconnaissance soldier. But the order from the superiors came down that underage children were not allowed to stay on the front line, and he immediately sent someone to send him back to the rear.</p>
<p>Orders cannot overcome human will. Vanya resolutely opposed being sent back to the rear. After the attempt failed, he actually escaped from the sender's oversight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he met Captain Yeraginov, the superior who ordered him to be sent back to the rear (at that time, Vanya did not recognize who he was). The captain, like other reconnaissance soldiers, had a good impression of him because of his intelligence and attractiveness. Without a doubt, he took the child back to the troops.</p>
<p>Vanya's wish was fulfilled, and he is now a reconnaissance soldier. When he went out to reconnaissance for the first time, he was unfortunately discovered by the enemy and captured. He did not escape and return to the team until the enemy troops retreated.</p>
<p>Captain Yeraginov's experience was the same as Vanya's. His young wife, elderly mother, and boy who was not yet seven years old were all brutally killed by the German invaders. All that was left was a string of anger and tragic memories. Therefore, he had a feeling of sympathy and intimacy with Vanya, and soon adopted Vanya as his godson, and in order to avoid danger (reconnaissance soldiers are very dangerous), he transferred him to the artillery team as a reserve soldier.</p>
<p>War is inherently cruel and inhumane. The artillery fire reached the sky, and blood and flesh were exchanged. A tense and fierce tank battle came on the Soviet-German border. Captain Yeraginov died for his country in this battle. A small note was found in his pocket, in which he asked his superiors to take care of his son and train him to be a good soldier.</p>
<p>Vanya was really soon sent to a military academy, starting a new page in his life.</p>
<p>The story ends like this. The author depicts the personality of each person clearly, making people feel that the characters in the book are lifelike. This is the most successful point of the book.</p>
<p>"Son of the Regiment" is a retranslation based on the English translation. The English translation is slightly different from the Russian text. The Russian text has a total of 28 chapters, while the English version only has 25 chapters. The English translator deleted some unimportant ones, so the chapter division is also different. The Chinese translation is the same as the English translation, but slightly different from the Russian text. This is also what readers should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Reading "Sexual Psychology"</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>Original by Havelock Ellis</p>
<p>Translated and annotated by Pan Guangdan, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>As the author, Zhi Ruo, often mentions in this book, modern humans pride themselves on being civilized enough, but they are still so ignorant about matters of sex. This kind of deeply rooted misconception suggests that the society we live in is not open-minded enough, and the author's criticisms of Europeans and Americans half a century ago are still very applicable to our country today.</p>
<p>Westerners' reluctance to discuss sexual issues is due to the constraints of religious traditions, while China has its own deformed moral concepts. Although the essence is different, the result is the same. From primitive humans to the present era, the mysterious veil surrounding "sex" has never been lifted. However, if it could be regarded as a mere abstract theory, it wouldn't matter if it were banished from the realm of thought, but it has a close and real relationship with every individual and cannot be abandoned!</p>
<p>Therefore, although it has not yet been possible to discuss it openly on the surface of society, many people have paid attention to it before considering it a topic for discussion. However, taking advantage of the psychological vulnerability and curiosity of young people, a large number of books on sex have already been circulating semi-openly on the market, passing from hand to hand among young people. Because the compilers of these books lack a serious attitude, the content is often biased or even deliberately distorted, not only failing to provide readers with the necessary common sense but also leading to various adverse consequences and anti-educational outcomes in an unscientific manner.</p>
<p>The Sacred Question</p>
<p>"Sex" is a sacred question and a responsibility for social educators. Sex education is of utmost importance to the nation, both in terms of spiritual life and public life, and cannot be neglected. Europeans and Americans only began to pay attention to this issue in the early 20th century. In addition to many research books being published one after another, based on various unique perspectives and methods, periodic publications also frequently discussed it, but the content was biased towards medicine or physiology. Later, after being applied to the framework of criminology, it gradually formed a cultural academic discipline.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Havelock Ellis, was a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, and he devoted almost his entire life to exploring this issue. With his literary talent, his research results were published and disseminated to various countries and societies. Although his perspective is also psychological, it differs from Freud's purely "psychoanalytic" approach, making it more scientific and progressive. Before the publication of this book, Ellis was already famous for his "Studies in the Psychology of Sex." However, while rich in content, it was not universal enough and not suitable as a manual for instilling common sense. It was not until the writing of this book that this long-awaited deficiency was filled.</p>
<p>Scientific Method</p>
<p>This book, which is less than 300,000 words, discusses every noteworthy "sexual" issue in a simple yet comprehensive manner. The method is scientific, and more so sociological and anthropological, analyzing and instructing from both horizontal and vertical perspectives, and it is also educational. The author not only objectively exposes the existence of a fact but also subjectively adds many opinions. These many opinions are often encountered by young people in the course of their lives and can determine their happiness or misfortune.</p>
<p>In terms of content, in addition to the topic indicated by the title, concerning sexual psychology, it also touches on various branches of other sexual issues. There are still clear boundaries that can be distinguished from sexual physiology and sexual hygiene. However, they are still interconnected and can be enlightening.</p>
<p>Outline of the Book</p>
<p>The framework consists of eight chapters and forty-three sections, plus a preface and a translator's note, and two appendices (including Ellis's unpublished biography). The form and context are clear. The first chapter, "General Considerations," discusses the author's overall views on the issue of "sex" and the motivation for research. The second chapter, "The Biology of Sex," starts from the physiological body and explains the process of its transfer to the spirit, and discusses "sexual selection" and its various factors in more detail. The following chapter, "Sexual Impulses in Adolescence," talks about the initial presentation of love and the measures taken to deal with it, explaining the various detours and the requirements for "sex education" for adolescents after making changes. The above three chapters almost completely describe the normal psychology of sex. The following two chapters are a study of sexual perversion. The symbolism of love, sexual deviations, and various abnormal sexual behaviors from childhood to decline, as well as the critical attitude given by society, constitute the content of the fourth chapter. Extending from this similar point is the issue of sexual inversion, that is, "homosexuality." In the fifth chapter, the author answers in detail and concludes with the treatment of this phenomenon of deviation. Chapter Six, "Marriage," explains the intricacies of this phenomenon from a psychological and social perspective, with many points that can supplement traditional views. "The Art of Love" in Chapter Seven expresses its relationship from a sexual point of view, considering it as one of the means of enjoying life. Finally, the "Conclusion" discusses the "dynamism" and "sublimation" of sexual impulses, respectively, and the great accumulation of human culture cannot be separated from this original force, which has always been considered obscene.</p>
<p>The Translator's Achievement</p>
<p>Even more commendable is the translator, Mr. Pan Guangdan, who is an authority on eugenics and physiology in our country. His efforts in translating this book are of epoch-making value and significance. The beauty of the translation is not only impeccable, but also the smoothness and harmony are truly worthy of admiration. In addition, there are nearly 100,000 words of annotations, and an appendix on homosexuality, separated from the annotations, which draws out examples from ancient Chinese literature and gives them a new scientific evaluation, so that countless doubtful signs in old literature can get a new basis, and it is considered another original way for Chinese scholars to study sexual psychology.</p>
<p>Ellis's original work was considered a banned book in foreign countries twenty years ago. Fortunately, there are no enthusiasts in China now who come out to "defend morality" and criticize it as indecent. Although there have been translations or writings similar to this book before, they have not been widely circulated. Another translation of this book, translated by Tian Fengmingzhang and titled "Sexual Psychology," has been published six times. However, in comparison, in addition to the lack of annotations and writing style, Feng's work also deletes too much about theoretical aspects. It is mentioned here incidentally, but the contributions of the two introducers to our society are worthy of praise.</p>
<p>As for the only shortcoming of this book, it can be said that the author still cannot completely get rid of his moralistic flavor. The old man often promotes his moderate moral views in various parts of this book. However, despite this, and despite many other places where we cannot agree, it is still not enough to diminish the value of this book. Even if it does not become a textbook template, it is circulated among young people. And because of the wide circulation, the formation of a new atmosphere and its contribution to the spiritual perspective of society are still immeasurable.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Huihui</h3>
<p>— Shi Mo</p>
<p>In May of the thirty-third year, when the enemy attacked Changsha, Deng hurriedly took one of his female classmates back to the countryside, because this female classmate's home had already fallen before Changsha. Deng's family called her "Miss Yang." But Deng called his female classmate "Huihui." Huihui was quite beautiful, and her age looked to be about nineteen, but Deng said she was only eighteen. Two soft, long braids hung on her shoulders, and a pair of large, dark eyes looked at people without shyness. On the first day of her arrival, Deng's entire family was amazed. On the second day, Deng's neighbors discovered that such a young lady had arrived, and they were also amazed. On the third and fourth days, the nearby towns were all amazed.</p>
<p>People exchanged the same opinions after seeing her, saying: "This Miss Yang actually followed Deng to his house? This is a time of war and chaos. In times of war and chaos, young people..." Saying this, everyone couldn't help but say at the same time: "Miss Yang is very beautiful, very pretty."</p>
<p>Deng's father, seeing that Deng took care of everything for Huihui and was very attentive, shook his head and said: "In this day and age, what love is there to be in love with?"</p>
<p>But soon, the enemy crossed Changsha and attacked Hengyang. This countryside was only a hundred miles away from Changsha, and it immediately became uneasy. People were busy escaping for their lives and rarely talked about Huihui. Deng's family also gradually became familiar with Huihui, as if there was no such person, or as if she was a member of the family. When holding family meetings to discuss escape, Huihui also sat next to Deng at the table.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, Deng's family moved to a mountain valley fifteen miles away from this town. From the second morning, Deng's family began to move.</p>
<p>At this time, Huihui suddenly became lively. She helped carry this and that, and lift this and that, working with Deng's mother, sister-in-law, and younger sister. When they felt they needed to ask Deng or male workers to help, Huihui immediately did it, and did it quickly and properly. In this way, Deng's mother felt very happy. A girl who likes to do boys' things is very suitable for "escape."</p>
<p>After moving to the mountain valley, many families had moved to the left and right of Deng's house. Deng's family lived in two small thatched huts of tenants. Because there were many women and children, Huihui often couldn't sleep in these two small huts. Deng took Huihui to go guerrilla everywhere. If there were other families where the women were not too crowded when they slept, Huihui would squeeze in with a smile. Everyone shouted: "Miss Yang! Miss Yang! You can't squeeze in." At this time, Huihui had already fallen asleep.</p>
<p>But Huihui was always reluctant to speak. She only smiled. When she was happy, she would widen her big eyes and speak loudly, laughing, and the two braids would swing violently left and right behind her head. Every three to five days, she would go with Deng and Deng's younger brother, along with workers, to go home to carry oil, salt, firewood, rice, and sundries. Deng's father's wine bottle was empty again, and suddenly his sister-in-law remembered that the child's shoes were still left at home. Huihui and the others risked walking fifteen miles to go home.</p>
<p>Although Huihui was very happy to transport things, it was not an easy task. In the small town, there were all kinds of people, and they all had weapons. Once, Huihui and the other three were cleaning up some sundries at home and carrying two bags of rice back to the mountain valley. As soon as they locked the door and turned around to leave, the team came from the town towards this side. They had to bend down and look for small paths to move to the deep grass, but they had to cross this road no matter what to return to the mountain valley. They waited and waited, but the team was too long. When it was dusk, Huihui said she couldn't wait any longer and wanted to cross the road. Seeing a soldier walking past five or six steps ahead, and the next soldier was ten or so steps behind, Huihui suddenly jumped up, sprinted across the road, and stepped into the deep grass on the other side, scaring the two soldiers. After swearing, Deng, his younger brother, and the worker also crossed the road in accordance with the law and returned to the small house in the mountain valley. It was already dark, and the whole family praised Huihui's bravery.</p>
<p>Huihui's two braids were her favorite. When she was bored sitting in the small house, she would untie them and ask her sister-in-law to comb them for her. After a month or two, everyone in Deng's family liked Huihui. Her sister-in-law also carefully braided her hair for her from time to time; sometimes she would sit there silently, and Deng's mother would also happily tease her. She asked her sister-in-law: "Miss Yang wants to comb her braids?" Suddenly, one time when she moved things back to the mountain valley, Huihui firmly asked her sister-in-law to cut off her two braids. People in the two small houses heard that Miss Yang wanted to cut her braids, and they all gathered around curiously. Everyone felt that it would be good to cut off the two braids, but everyone knew that Huihui had deep feelings for these two braids, so although they agreed, they also expressed great regret; some said: "Miss Yang doesn't have to cut them, the situation looks like it will get better soon." Deng walked in from the outside and said, "Huihui, why do you have to cut them?" Huihui was hesitating, and when she heard Deng say this, she said to Deng: "Why shouldn't I cut them? Is it better to cut them, or is it better to be raped by someone? I want to cut them!" Her sister-in-law searched for scissors and stood behind Huihui, blushing at these words: "Miss Yang, then I'll cut them." Huihui gritted her teeth and said, "Cut!" Two crystal-clear tears rolled straight down her face. Her sister-in-law took the two braids and walked out the door. Huihui fell on the bed and cried loudly.</p>
<p>It turned out that this day, when they went home to move things, they were chased by five soldiers. Huihui heard someone behind her say: "There's a woman in front, with two braids, hurry up and chase after her?" Huihui knew the road well and ran back, her heart pounding in her mouth; so she decided to cut off her two braids. After that, Huihui's Western-style hair didn't look like Western-style hair, and people cast strange eyes on her. Huihui didn't pay much attention at first, but later she gradually became uneasy. Once, Deng and Huihui went out, because it was late and the sound of random gunfire was very dense, they did not return to the mountain valley. When they went back the next morning, they said they had spent the night at the house of another tenant named Li. Her sister-in-law casually asked how they slept? The Li tenant only had one torn mattress. Deng said: "We two slept in the same bed." A woman who was standing there was shocked: "You two slept in the same bed?" Deng felt that it was impossible to reason with this kind of woman, so he didn't explain. So the story spread, and it spread very quickly.</p>
<p>When people nearby saw Deng and Huihui walking together, they secretly exchanged the same opinions, saying: "They have already slept together...but!" Saying this, everyone couldn't help but say at the same time: "They are still a couple, a good couple."</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Huihui couldn't stay any longer. Hearing these words, she also blushed. Finally, Huihui said goodbye to Deng's father and left alone.</p>
<p>Her sister-in-law was very worried about Huihui and asked Deng to escort Huihui out of the dangerous area.</p>
<p>Huihui soon arrived in Chongqing and heard that she had already gotten married this year.</p>
<p>After Deng sent Huihui away, he blamed himself very much, saying that he shouldn't have casually said those words in front of the neighbor woman, and that people in the countryside wouldn't understand young people.</p>
<p>Hearing the news of Huihui's marriage, Deng was very happy, but whenever he met people, he would always smile and say: "Having a wife like Huihui is mischievous all day long!"</p>
<h3>Two Christmas Carols</h3>
<p>— Yan Yunran</p>
<p>Christmas Lament</p>
<p>Jesus descends in a Bethlehem cave</p>
<p>At midnight, all is quiet and still</p>
<p>The moon in the sky</p>
<p>Envelops the countryside in light</p>
<p>The wind blowing through the shepherd's shelter feels even colder</p>
<p>Originally coming to the valley for the sake of the world</p>
<p>But the hearts of the world are as hard as iron</p>
<p>Look how sad and pitiful the Holy Infant is</p>
<p>Jesus descends, alone in Bethlehem</p>
<p>Waiting quietly in the deep mountains for the world to come</p>
<p>But only the sound of the wind is heard, no human figures are seen</p>
<p>Smiling with tears in his eyes, facing the empty mountains</p>
<p>Extending small hands to bestow blessings and grace</p>
<p>Only because of deep affection, relying on hope day and night</p>
<p>Who knows that the world is numb and indifferent</p>
<p>Look how melancholy and sad the Holy Infant is</p>
<p>Jesus is born in a shepherd's shelter in the countryside</p>
<p>Hidden in a desolate mountain cave outside Bethlehem</p>
<p>Lonely and without anyone, the moon hangs at midnight</p>
<p>Drops of sour tears flow into the heart</p>
<p>For more than four thousand years, all people have yearned</p>
<p>But tonight, when he comes, they do not know where to seek him</p>
<p>Drunk and dreaming, lost and wandering</p>
<p>Look how the Holy Infant secretly grieves and weeps</p>
<p>Angels and Shepherds</p>
<p>Angels</p>
<p>Shepherds of Bethlehem, do not be alarmed</p>
<p>Announce to you the gospel of peace</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Savior has been longed for</p>
<p>Tonight at midnight, he has descended</p>
<p>Descended in the icy suburbs of Bethlehem</p>
<p>Dwelling in a mountain cave, lying in a manger</p>
<p>All is silent and still</p>
<p>The bright moon drifts in the clear wind</p>
<p>Hurry forward, do not hesitate</p>
<p>The cave in front of the western mountains</p>
<p>Is where the Holy Infant is born</p>
<p>Shepherds</p>
<p>For four thousand years, we have awaited the Messiah</p>
<p>Tonight, he descends to the world</p>
<p>The angels announce he is in a mountain cave</p>
<p>The cave is in front of the western mountains</p>
<p>All is clear and still</p>

<p>Singing in unison to give thanks</p>
<p>For the infinite redemptive love of his birth</p>
<h3>Recommending a Solo Recital</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>—Professor Lu Zhu Hong, Baritone—</p>
<p>No matter how advanced instrumental music is, the feeling of intimacy and sincerity of vocal music is often incomparable to the pure expression of instrumental music. If you do not know how to appreciate the wonderful vocal music, you will not know the "magic" of music.</p>
<p>Anyone can learn vocal music, but only a few can become singers, because the innate vocal cords determine everything. In China, because most people are relatively weak, generally speaking, innate conditions make their pronunciation smaller, weaker, and looser than Westerners, and not as solid, strong, and powerful as Westerners. This can be distinguished in ordinary language pronunciation. Therefore, we can say this: Chinese people who study vocal music need more talent and more hard work.</p>
<p>There are not many Chinese singers, but in recent Shanghai, there are many individual solo recitals. I dare not say how good their achievements are, but it can be said that there are many geniuses among them. Those who have heard Si Yigui's baritone are very satisfied. Enthusiastic audiences hope that he can make more progress after he goes to the United States and not let "Lawrence Tibbett" have all the glory. At the same time, we hope to have more Si Yigui and better Si Yigui.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to recommend another unique genius—Professor Lu Chou Hong, a baritone singer. He has put in nine years of hard work in vocal music and is a proud student of Su Shilin, a famous teacher in Shanghai. To put it very simply, judging from his appearance, it may already be determined that he is physically qualified; just like Mr. Xu Mianqing, director of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, his appearance is already a sign of a good baritone.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu is a "dramatic baritone." Those who have heard him sing praise his great efforts and beautiful timbre. In his technique, all aspects are expressed very richly. Whether it is timbre, tone, or expression, they are beyond the reach of ordinary poor singers. The success of any singer is mostly due to the "richness" of the expression in all aspects, because only by being "rich" can "power" be expressed. The quality of music depends on "power."</p>
<p>It is easy to sing small songs, but it is difficult to sing arias from operas. A good singer can cope with these arias with ease and without any effort. Lu Zhu Hong's achievement lies in his wide range, rich volume, and expression. He doesn't care much about the most difficult aria in the opera "Pagliacci." Therefore, this introduction is really not an intentional exaggeration!</p>
<p>On the evenings of the 27th and 28th, this rich and powerful "dramatic baritone" will appear in the Lyceum Theatre. In addition to several major programs such as the aria from "Un Ballo in Maschera" and the aria from Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," there will also be the most popular folk song "Song of the Volga Boatmen" and Chinese songs. I think these wonderful performances will make countless music fans be intoxicated in the "magic of sound."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 133</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"So, who told you my address?"</p>
<p>"Teacher Aoki."</p>
<p>"Oh..."! Tsurumi became a little agitated again, "Who gave Elder Aoki the news"?</p>
<p>"Your Excellency yourself"!</p>
<p>"Who"? Tsurumi thought he heard it wrong.</p>
<p>"Big brother yourself"! Pingzi repeated.</p>
<p>"Nonsense"! Tsurumi spoke without thinking. When he said these two words, he felt that these two words blurted out were too harmful, so he immediately wanted to change his words and apologize to explain, but he heard the other party making a special surprised cry on the phone, which was like resentment and like surprise. This made Tsurumi stunned there, and he didn't know how to explain for a while, and the other party seemed to be stunned, chewing on the meaning of these two words.</p>
<p>Tsurumi casually said these two words, which were very ordinary, but why did it deserve such disrespect? He didn't know that since Tsurumi and Pingzi had a conversation on the beach under the moon last night, Tsurumi had already decided to treat Pingzi's entanglement with a "respect" attitude. But it was not a "respect and distance" method; because Tsurumi felt that Pingzi's talent and status could indeed be used, but he couldn't get close to her. Getting close to her would give Pingzi a chance to attack with love. Therefore, it is best to maintain a considerable distance between him and her, and build a "respect" wall in this distance to isolate the path of talking about love.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such a good "trick," which took a lot of effort to calculate, was unintentionally destroyed under this sudden phone call. "Nonsense" these two words, from one side, were too disrespectful, and from the other side, they were too close, as close as the tone of family, father, son, close friends, and lovers. Too disrespectful or too close was not appropriate for Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, Pingzi... because I haven't rested all night, my nerves are not listening, and I used such inappropriate words"!</p>
<p>"Happy...? Why shouldn't I? Um?... But I also know... you think I shouldn't be so casual with you... In short, you still treat me as an annoying outsider... I also know that you will never give me a chance..." Her voice was a little off, as if she was sad?</p>
<p>"Hey... hey... Pingzi, you..." Tsurumi couldn't think of a suitable way to block her words for a while.</p>
<p>"Big brother, you are very busy, don't let my idle talk delay your business. Please use paper and pen to write down a few words that Teacher Aoki asked me to pass on to you..." There was no sound of speech, but it was the password that was knocked out on the phone with fingernails.</p>
<p>When Tsurumi heard this password method, he was greatly surprised, because what Pingzi used was exactly the special password that Tsurumi invented and thought could not be solved. So he quickly wrote it down with paper and pen:</p>
<p>"Yu'er, your plan will definitely have no results, and someone has already taken action in advance; the purpose is different, the goal is one. Therefore, you should end everything and return to the mainland quickly, and don't advance any further. The current situation is already set and it is difficult to turn the tide. This is what I deduced using the Zhou Tian Yigong mathematics, and you must believe it. Hao Ran the old man Inoue Aoki, showed".</p>
<p>This password was the crystallization of Tsurumi's hard work. The hidden song sentences were all in his stomach. As soon as he saw the number, he immediately wrote out the text. Fearing that the number was wrong, he immediately asked Pingzi to tap it again to correct it.</p>
<p>"Pingzi, I still have a question, can I ask you to explain it"?</p>
<p>"I know"! Pingzi giggled again. "You want to know where Teacher Aoki found out your secret from, don't you"?</p>
<p>"That's right, please teach me".</p>
<p>"It's still the same old saying, it was Big Brother himself who told him everything."</p>
<p>"You used mystery again"?</p>
<p>"Not at all wrong. At eight o'clock in the morning. He used me as a medium to perform a hypnosis; I'm afraid you were also sleeping at that time, so the results were very good. You didn't need to be forced at all, and you said everything in your heart."</p>
<h3>A Saint and a Sinner: The Love Story of George Eliot</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yu Jing</p>
<p>Hollywood is hesitant, the reason being that they want to film a historical movie about the Victorian novelist George Eliot. Directors want to produce a film about the life of this famous novelist, but they cannot decide which George Eliot they should portray.</p>
<p>Should the film depict the George Eliot known to readers around the world through her works? Her readers considered her a guardian of strict morality, where a moral transgression was an indelible sin, and anyone committing an improper act should atone with their life.</p>
<p>Or should the film depict her life as known by many neighbors near the quiet Royal Park in London? To her neighbors, the famous novelist Marian Evans [Translator's note: This is her real name] was a licentious woman, living openly with another woman's husband near the legal wife's residence without any sense of shame.</p>
<p>However, this strange female writer did not worry that Hollywood directors would consider the contradictions in her dual life. She firmly believed in the morality in her own works, but she equally believed that the love with the man who could never marry her was the only happiness the world gave her.</p>
<p>Just as George Sand had her Chopin, George Eliot also had her George Henry Lewes.</p>
<p>If a smooth-talking philanderer were to comment, Marian Evans was not a captivating girl. She was already in her thirties when she fell in love, which was considered a scandal in London's literary circles at the time. Although she had a slender and healthy figure and a dignified face, she could not be called a beauty. Because she often browsed Greek and Latin literature, philosophy, and sociology, her large, blue-green eyes were somewhat nearsighted.</p>
<p>When she met Lewes at the home of a mutual friend, Chapman, she only admired and translated ancient texts and had not yet considered becoming a creative novelist. Shortly after they met, they developed feelings for each other, and their relationship lasted for twenty-five years, which is something a fickle girl could not achieve based on a momentary impulse. Lewes was said to have a slender figure, thick, curly hair, a mustache, and eyebrows, and there was some handsomeness about him.</p>
<p>Another point that needs to be mentioned is that Lewes' wife often went out with good friends, leaving him to raise three children. At that time, George Eliot's serious Puritan spirit and the nature of a witty essayist merged together, and they benefited greatly and found happiness in each other, fully developing their achievements to the highest point.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from George Eliot's biography in the famous women's biography written by Walter Brandes, depicting how the famous female writer defied Victorian England's morality and fell in love with that man, while making an evaluation of George Eliot's behavior that was both defensive and regretful.</p>
<p>"When Lewes was thirty years old, he had already engaged in criticism, novels, biographies, dramas, and philosophical research. He had traveled abroad, so his experience of human nature was very extensive. He had also stood on the podium and spoken to the masses, and he had also engaged in arduous and interesting reporting work. It is said that he even played the role of a clown in a traveling troupe.</p>
<p>"Because he was lively by nature and spoke freely, his enthusiasm, absurdity, and unrestrained talk and demeanor sometimes aroused the interest of his friends and sometimes surprised them."</p>
<p>"When George Eliot met this man, she felt extraordinary waves in her heart. She felt that this man was completely different from the men she had seen in her youth when she lived in Warwickshire and in the monastery where she grew up. She realized that a crisis was coming into her life. She had to make a decision privately to guide her behavior, which was not based on the general standards of morality in England at the time but on the harmony of her inner beliefs."</p>
<p>"It is likely that Mr. Lewes wrote her a letter explaining his situation and trying to persuade Miss Evans to be his life partner. Later, she agreed because she believed that it did not infringe on the rights of others. She became his wife, but could not become a legal wife because he could not divorce."</p>
<p>"This caused great shock among her friends. For example, Mrs. Bray and her sister gradually restored their close friendship with her after understanding that her conscience was still so perfect."</p>
<p>"George Eliot was such an extremely sensitive woman, and this matter must have caused her particularly painful suffering. She did not realize that her behavior was wrong. She gained perfect spiritual friendship from the man she loved. However, taking such a bold step created a deep rift between her and many relatives, which was enough to disturb her brave nature. Her companions were very in awe of her seriousness, but she sacrificed morality for love, causing great panic among her companions, as if the sky had fallen."</p>
<p>When she called herself "Mrs. Lewes," it was considered the third time she had changed her name without legal approval. Her baptismal name was Mary Ann, and she changed it to Marian, reportedly because the latter was more beautiful.</p>
<p>Her male pen name, George Eliot, was probably not only to hide her real name but also to avoid being discovered about her affair with Lewes. However, this wish was shattered after her famous work Adam Bede was printed.</p>
<p>In 1858, Mr. MacArthur said in her biography: "Everyone is guessing, but most of them are guessing wrong. Because everyone is paying attention to George Eliot's book A Sketch of Clerical Life."</p>
<p>Mr. MacArthur wrote in her biography: "At that time, only Charles Dickens pointed to this secret clue and said: If these two volumes of novels were not written by a woman, I am willing to admit that I am a woman!"</p>
<p>A year later, the secret was revealed. That was the publication of Adam Bede, with the first title writing: "To my dear husband, George Henry Lewes."</p>
<p>Those titles said: "Dedicated to my dear husband, George Henry Lewes, if it were not for his love that gave my life happiness, I would never have been able to write these manuscripts. Marian Lewes." (Translated from magazine digests)</p>
<h3>Compassion</h3>
<p>— Millais</p>
<p>Millais (E. Millais 1829-1896) was an outstanding figure painter in 19th-century England, as famous as Rossetti, and considered a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His noble character and poetic decoration are expressed in his paintings. This painting, originally named Mercy-Saint Bartholomew's day, depicts a massacre during the French religious revolution. The situation is vivid, and the picture is compact. It can be called a representative work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. (Lion)</p>

<h3>Candy and Dance</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A female employee of the Sullivan Candy Company told me:</p>
<p>On the day before St. John's Day (the 24th), chocolate alone sold for more than 1.7 million yuan in one afternoon. Many customers waited in front of the counter. As soon as the factory delivered the candy, it was snatched up before it was even unpacked. The factory production could not keep up, otherwise even more could have been sold.</p>
<p>I was not surprised when she told me this. I coldly asked her how much chocolate cost per pound. She said 10,000 yuan. I said, "It's only a little over 1,700 pounds, what's so strange about that?"</p>
<p>Indeed, there are too many people in Shanghai who can afford chocolate that costs 10,000 yuan per pound, and it's more than just these 1,700 people.</p>
<p>From the small to the big, the consumption in other aspects this Christmas is really unknown!</p>
<p>However, the market is still sluggish. On Christmas Eve, at around ten o'clock, I went to a large dance hall with a few friends for sightseeing. There were only a few guests in the seats. Although the musicians were playing enthusiastically, the desolate atmosphere could not be dispelled. The dancers said when they saw the guests: "Business is bad!" Compared with today last year, this scene is really unbearable to look back on.</p>
<p>The above two examples can be said to be a unity of contradictions, fully illustrating the economic chaos of Shanghai society. Mencius said: "Eating and sex are human nature." Eating still ranks first. If you look at it superficially, Shanghainese would rather eat candy, and whether they can dance is secondary. In economic terms, one pound of chocolate can be universally tasted by big and small people, while a moment of pleasure in the dance hall costs more than 10,000 yuan and only pleases one person.</p>
<p>But this cannot be used to explain the current economic situation.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from Various Countries</p>
<h3>Between Men and Women, Joys and Sorrows, Separations and Reunions, Nothing is Surprising</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chun Liang from the December issue of International Digest</p>
<p>In Canada, it is a paradise for married people. On average, one in every 161 marriages ends in divorce; in the UK, it's one in 96; in Sweden, it's one in 33; in Norway, it's one in 30; in Germany, it's one in 24; in France, it's one in 21. Finally, in the US, an average of one in seven marriages ends in divorce.</p>
<p>A Scottish girl once pretended to be another woman. She hid her true identity and lured her husband to spend the night in a hotel, and tried to get as many people as possible to see it. Later, she accused her husband of having an affair and filed for divorce. However, this trick was discovered, and she was sentenced to six months in prison.</p>
<p>In Calcutta, a seventeen-year-old woman named Gorselye Gomi filed for divorce, accusing her ten-year-old husband, Liki Cang Gomi, of being unable to support their living expenses.</p>
<p>In Charleston, a woman filed for divorce from her husband, accusing him of kicking her. As a result, she lost her case. Because the judge noticed that the man was a cripple with only one leg.</p>
<p>In the city of Burgago in Yugoslavia, a 111-year-old Jura was involved in a divorce case, accused of enticing women. The fact is that Martin, 98, and Qiuya, 95, had a quarrel. Qiuya ran to Jura after being scolded by her husband. Because Jura had been a bachelor for her whole life and had always hoped that Qiuya would marry him one day.</p>
<p>In San Jose, California, USA, a man filed for divorce, accusing his wife of bringing her beloved monkey to bed every night. The judge instead sided with his wife, granting her the rights she was entitled to. Because the judge thought that if a man did not have the courage and ability to kick a little monkey out of bed, could that man be considered a "real man"?</p>
<p>In the city of Guanajuato in Mexico, a simple letter stating "incompatibility" can be mailed to request a divorce and get it approved.</p>
<p>In Reno, the famous divorce city, there was once a day when 58 divorce cases were resolved in just one day.</p>
<p>Hollywood movie stars, based on the average annual marriage rate, have 54 divorces out of 65 marriages. It is said that movie stars remarrying after divorce does not affect their reputation. And fans do not blame movie stars for not getting married.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, 73 women who had been divorced for five years were asked about their feelings about divorce. Forty-one women felt regretful, 25 women felt happy with their free life, and seven women returned to their husbands.</p>
<p>In Elizabeth, USA, an 82-year-old Mrs. Osborne was granted a divorce. The reason for the divorce was: her husband always insisted on knowing where she was going and who she was with when she went out.</p>
<p>In Connecticut (USA), Mrs. Fulton had a habit of kissing a kangaroo before kissing her husband, John. So John Fulton got his divorce request approved.</p>
<p>In Missouri (USA), a deaf and mute husband filed for divorce from his deaf and mute wife, accusing her of constantly scolding him with silent sign language.</p>
<p>In Iroquois, if an Indian woman wants to divorce her husband, she only needs to place his riding gear and all his personal belongings outside the house. After seeing this hint, the husband will automatically leave.</p>
<p>In Barbados, the locals handle divorces themselves. A couple divides the house in the middle with a boundary line, the husband moves in his half of the house, and the wife lives in the other half.</p>
<p>In Siam, if a man feels a little tired of his wife, he can sell her publicly. However, the woman he married for the first time must be legally divorced.</p>
<p>In Italy, a man was granted a divorce because his wife kept thirteen life-size Buddha statues in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Many fashionable women in Paris have created a "divorce ring," which is made of white gold and worn on the little finger of the right hand. Because these divorced wives want to let those young men know that they are free people who can marry at any time.</p>
<h3>British New-Style "Toaster."</h3>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section</p>
<h3>The Organization of Beggars 19</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Street Performance Begging (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the local hardcore beggar gangs, the begging methods they practice still follow the traditions of the Jianghu. The sects are divided into eighteen categories, called the "Eighteen Sects of the Jianghu." These are listed and explained below:—</p>
<p>(1) "Singing Daoqing" — This is a refined singing beggar gang, including those who sing "Yunhua Luo." Their tools are divided into "three woods" and "leather tubes." The three woods are used to sing "Yunhua Luo," and the fixed lyrics cover a wide range of topics. When the beggar walks to the door of each industry's store, he must sing the lyrics of that industry. And it must be relevant and appropriate, and it must not be perfunctory by putting Zhang's hat on Li's head. If the store does not give him money, he will also make a few jokes in the lyrics, and even make vicious insults. The store can't do anything about him. "Leather tube" is used to sing Daoqing. They are considered civilized people, and they wear long gowns to show their class difference from the common flow. They don't take the money with their hands, but clip it into the tube with a tube board. This is the rule of the gang. The lyrics are indeed Daoqing tunes, and the material is also taken from ancient people's stories. Store owners are happy to give alms when they encounter beggars who sing Daoqing. Because these people are neat and tidy, and they are not annoying. But to be able to sing the lyrics, you must be literate. And you must be able to adapt to the situation. Those who are not very literate are not qualified to be in this role.</p>
<p>(2) "Swallowing Swords and Bullets" — This sect is also called "Jiali Shou." Their behavior is similar to "Shandong people changing tricks, wanting money but not their lives." They scare people by swallowing swords and iron bullets. Swallowing swords is called "long strips," and swallowing bullets is called "containing groups." When these beggars come to the door, they all say: "Boss, please give me something." They don't say anything else. They leave when they are given money. If they are not given money, they will use a two-foot-long knife and a walnut-sized iron bullet, and aim it straight into the throat. Then tears and snot flow out together. They won't leave unless they are given more money.</p>
<p>(3) "Soft and Hard Martial Arts" — This gang is divided into two factions: soft and hard. "Soft Martial Arts" beggars carry small eighteen weapons with them, and use a spear to stand upright on the top of their heads. "Hard Martial Arts" beggars don't carry any tools. When they go to the store or house, they can take any object and hold it on the tip of their noses without letting it fall. They can hold a ten-pound door bolt and an extremely sharp meat axe. This relies on real skills, which is not comparable to soft martial arts.</p>
<p>(4) "Water Flower Bowl" — It is said to be a technical performance similar to a Jianghu troupe, divided into two factions: "Big Flower" and "Small Flower." "Big Flower" uses two large bowls of water, tied with ropes. They are swung left and right, and rotated into a ring shape. It is considered real skill if the water does not pour out. "Small Flower" uses a bowl to hold the paste, and there is a hook at the end. The hook is planted on the arm, holding a bowl of water. Fresh blood drips from the arm, making people feel pitiful and give him money. In fact, there is already a small hole in the arm, like the hole in a woman's ear for earrings. When he goes out, he rubs some pig blood on it, which looks like a new tattoo. This can be said to be "man-made self-flowing blood," just to deceive passersby.</p>
<p>(5) "Real and Fake Dogs" — This sect takes dogs out to beg for money, calling the dog "strip." In the beggar gang, they are considered elder brothers. They cannot be filled by young beggars. They rely on dogs to eat, calling dogs "wooden money." They can only go to the streets to respond to the market after they have been tamed. They run when told to run, and jump when told to jump. To amuse the people in the store's residence. In addition, there is another kind of beggar who wears a dog's head to beg, and sings a song of barking:—</p>
<p>"Wang wang has wealth and fragrance!</p>
<p>Buzzing dog comes to wealth!</p>
<p>Boss gives money to raise the dog."</p>
<p>These people actually voluntarily transform themselves into dogs in order to get money. Their behavior is unbearable to the human eye. In the gang, they are called "Zhuang Tiao," which is no different from beasts in clothing.</p>
<h3>Women in the Eyes of Scientists</h3>
<p>— Yun Bei</p>
<p>I recently obtained a magazine from a friend, and when I opened it, it was the annual journal of the Engineering Society of the University of London this year. There is a short article analyzing women with "scientific methods," and the content is very "cute." I translated it to enrich the "Free Talk."</p>
<p>Element: Woman.</p>
<p>Existence: Can be found wherever men exist.</p>
<p>Rarely exists in an uncombined free state. With a few exceptions, it is combined with other things.</p>
<p>Physical properties: Color, shape, size, age, are all uncertain.</p>
<p>The surface is covered with a thin layer of greasy fat.</p>
<p>It can be made to be depressed and frozen (freeze) at any time, but with proper treatment, it can be thawed and renewed.</p>
<p>Chemical properties: Very active.</p>
<p>Extremely fond of combining with valuable items such as gold, silver, platinum, and high-priced minerals.</p>
<p>If left alone, the face turns blue.</p>
<p>Insoluble in water, but when ethanol (alcohol) is combined with it, its activity will be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>Sometimes it does not exert resistance (pressure).</p>
<p>Extremely perishable, the appearance will change greatly in ten years. The fresh ones have great magnetism. Precautions: In the hands of inexperienced people, this element is similar to advanced explosives.</p>
<h3>What is "Qiushi"? An Explanation from Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>I saw the article "Stealing Urine to Make Secret Medicine" in this newspaper on the 21st, and I felt that the discussion of making "Qiushi" was not detailed enough, so I am supplementing it now.</p>
<p>According to traditional Chinese medicine, there are three kinds of medicines made from human urine: (1) Urine. (2) Niao Bai Zhu. (3) That is, "Qiushi."</p>
<p>Urine is called Reincarnation Wine or Returning Yuan Soup by experts. There are many therapeutic effects recorded in the medical books. In fact, it is very effective in treating bruises and injuries. Other claims are a bit exaggerated.</p>
<p>Niao Bai Zhu is called Renzhong Bai, which is an essential medicine used in the throat department of Chinese medicine, and it is also used to treat diabetes. However, Chinese medicine practitioners rarely use it in internal medicine prescriptions.</p>
<p>As for the name Qiushi, it is actually borrowed. It is the essence of the alchemists' alchemy in ancient times. Because of its white color and firmness, it is named "Qiushi." Therefore, Huainanzi said: "The elixir is called Qiushi."</p>
<p>As for the crystals made from urine, the shape and color are the same as those made by alchemists, so they are also called "Qiushi." How is Qiushi made from urine? Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty says it in great detail. I will record it below:</p>
<p>"Qiushi must be taken from boys' urine in the autumn moon. Put seven qian of gypsum powder in each jar, and use mulberry branches to clear and settle it. Pour off the clear liquid, do this two or three times, then add a barrel of autumn dew water and stir it to clear it: do this several times, remove the dregs and dirt, reduce the salty taste, spread it on heavy paper and dry it on the ashes, completely take up the light and clear ones at the top as "Qiushi." Scrape off the heavy and turbid ones at the bottom. The ancients established the name based on this meaning. Men use boys' urine, and women use boys' urine." Only such a treatment can be called authentic. In addition to this, there are some unscrupulous merchants who make shoddy products and make tricky methods:</p>
<p>"...Doctors in the world do not take Qiushi in the autumn, but collect people's urine, but use soap pod water to clear, dry, and refine it, and burn it for Yang refining, which is completely lost in the way. How can it fit the name! The matchmaker is detrimental to people, how can it respond to the disease?" Like this kind of inferior product, there are also forgeries made by changing Renzhong Bai. Taking it is harmful and useless, and it is even more a matter of intention.</p>
<p>The efficacy of this product is stated in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "It mainly treats deficiency and cold diseases, urinary incontinence, spermatorrhea, nourishes kidney water, nourishes Dantian, returns to the original, returns to life, calms the five viscera, moistens the three jiaos, eliminates phlegm and cough, reduces bone steaming, softens hard lumps, brightens the eyes, clears the heart..." (But very few doctors and users use it.)</p>
<p>Ordinary swollen patients should avoid salt, so some people use Qiushi instead of salt to cook vegetables for patients. If this product is used as an elixir for prolonging life, then it is extremely foolish!</p>
<p>In major traditional Chinese medicine stores, a piece of one or two qian in size can be bought for one or two thousand yuan. Its shape is quite like rock candy. Good-hearted gentlemen, why not buy a piece to see for yourself? If medical scientists or chemists study its ingredients and medicinal effects, it will save me and others a lot of suspicion! (Li Renzhong)</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wan</p>
<p>There is a large open space in front of the Huangpu Sub-bureau facing Jinling East Road. This place is located in the central district and has good Feng Shui. If the municipal government and the police bureau allow vendors to set up stalls here, wouldn't it really give them strong assistance? In this way, on the one hand, it shows the methods that the authorities give to the vendors, and on the other hand, it shows that the vendors and the police have reconciled, everyone is smiling, all the accumulated grievances have disappeared, and harmony generates wealth!</p>
<p>However, let me declare: I am not a vendor.</p>
<h3>This is a Panoramic View of the San Francisco Coast</h3>
<p>(1) is Angel Island, (2) is Alcatraz Island, where the Federal Penitentiary is located, (3) is the location of the military shipyard, and (4) is the garrison of the army. This magnificent land was once considered the best site for the United Nations headquarters.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Gan Naiguang</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>"Down with the great powers, down with the great powers, eliminate the warlords, eliminate the warlords, the National Revolution succeeds, the National Revolution succeeds, sing joyfully, sing together joyfully."</p>
<p>The author of this well-known National Revolution song, familiar to women and children, is none other than the current Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gan Naiguang. It was hastily drafted in 1925 before the Central Party Headquarters held a party congress in Guangzhou. From this, one can glimpse his talent.</p>
<p>Mr. Gan once served as a political instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. He is not only skilled in rhetoric, but also fluent and readable in writing. In the past, he deeply earned the trust of the late martyr Liao Zhongkai. Mr. Gan is currently 50 years old, from Cenxi County, Guangxi Province, and a graduate of Guangzhou Lingnan University. After graduation, he served as a professor of economics at the university and authored "A History of Pre-Qin Economic Thought" and "Several Fundamental Problems of the Chinese Kuomintang." His translated works include "A History of British Political Parties" and "Outline of Artistic Photography." His talent and learning can be described as extensive. In addition, he has authored many pamphlets on party affairs, hence the title "Theoretician of the Three Principles of the People." At that time, his prominence even surpassed that of the "old-brand" theoretician Dai Jitao and others.</p>
<p>He enjoys photography and composing new poetry. His skill in the former has already reached the level of an expert.</p>
<p>This summer, he was appointed as our country's special envoy to attend the celebration of Philippine independence. He has recently developed a hobby of collecting stamps.</p>
